<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>TO tell thee that Ari&s;totle, the learned Author of this book, was generally reported to be the mo&s;t knowing philo&s;opher in the world, is no more than what every intelligent per&s;on already knows: nor can any think otherwi&s;e, who will give them|&s;elves the lei&s;ure to con&s;ider that he was the &s;cholar of Plato (who was in his time the only reputed phi|lo&s;opher for wi&s;dom) and under him Ari&s;totle prof|ited &s;o much that he was cho&s;en by King Philip of Macedon as the mo&s;t worthy and proper per&s;on in his dominions, to be tutor to his &s;on Alexander, by who&s;e wi&s;e precepts and in&s;tructions, Alexander became ma&s;ter of &s;o great wi&s;dom, judgment, prow|e&s;s and magnanimity, that he ju&s;tly obtained the title of the great. And Alexander him&s;elf was &s;o &s;en&s;ible of the advantage he received by the in&s;truc|tions of &s;o great a Stagyrite, (for &s;o Ari&s;totle was called from the country of Stagy<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> where he was born) that he affirmed that he was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ore beholden to his tutor Ari&s;totle, for the cultivation of his mind, than to Philip his father, for the kingdom of Mace|don.</P>
<P>Now though Ari&s;totle applied him&s;elf univer&s;ally to the inve&s;tigation of all the &s;ecrets of nature, and for that obtained an univer&s;al fame, yet that with which he was plea&s;ed in a more e&s;pecial and pecul|iar manner, to bring into a fuller and more true light, was the unfolding of the &s;ecrets of nature with re&s;pect to the generation of man: This is called his Ma&s;ter Piece; and in this he has made &s;o thorough a &s;earch, that he has, as it were, turned nature in&s;ide outwards.</P>
<P>Nor let any think the&s;e things to be below the &s;tudy of &s;o great a philo&s;opher, &s;ince the divine rec|ords <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ure us, that it has been the &s;tudy of divers
<PB N="6" REF="028209_0004_0FD720418CAD1E00">
illu&s;trious per&s;ons equally renowned for wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s among whom I may well reckon Job the greate&s;t man in all &s;ecrets of nature, who has made it &s;ufficiently evident, by that excellent philo&s;ophic|al account he gives of the generation of man, in the tenth chapter of that book which bears his name where he &s;ays, "Thine hands have made me, and fa&s;hioned me together round about: Thou ha&s;t pour|ed me out as milk and curdled me like chee&s;e; thou ha&s;t clothed me with &s;kin and fle&s;h, and ha&s;t fenced me with bones and &s;inews." Another in|&s;tance of illu&s;trious per&s;ons that have &s;tudied the &s;ecrets of nature in the generation of man, is that of one of the greate&s;t, as well as the be&s;t kings of I&s;rael, I mean king David, &s;o great a prince, that he may be &s;aid to have not only laid the foundation, but al&s;o to have &s;ettled the Hebrew monarchy; and his piety was &s;uperiour to his power, being peculiar|ly &s;tyled, "A man after God's own heart." Let us hear what this man &s;aith of the &s;ecrets of nature in his divine &s;oliloquies to his Creator, "<BIBL>P&s;alm cxxxix.13, 14, &amp;c,</BIBL> Thou ha&s;t covered me in my mother's womb; I will prai&s;e thee, for I am fear|fully and wonderfully made; marvellous are thy works, and that my &s;oul knoweth right well. My &s;ub&s;tance was not hid from thee, when I was made in &s;ecret and curiou&s;ly wrought in the lowe&s;t parts of the earth. Thine eyes did &s;ee my &s;ub&s;tance, yet being imperfect, and in thy book all my members were written which in continuance were fa&s;hioned, when as yet there was none of them."</P>
<P>Now let the forequoted words of holy Job, and the&s;e la&s;t of king David, be put together, and I will make no &s;cruple to affirm, that they make up the mo&s;t accurate &s;y&s;tem of philo&s;ophy re&s;pecting the generation of man, that has ever yet been written.</P>
<P>And why &s;hould not the my&s;teries of nature, in the generation of man, be without blame enquired into; &s;ince &s;o great a tribute of prai&s;e redounds from hence unto the God of nature? The more we
<PB N="7" REF="028209_0005_0FD7204C20F19030">
know of tho&s;e works the more our hearts will be en|gaged to prai&s;e him, as we &s;ee in the in&s;tance of David before us: "I will prai&s;e thee (&s;ays he) for I am fearfully and wonderfully made." And then he breaks out into this exclamation, "Marvellous are thy works, and that my &s;oul knoweth right well."</P>
<P>If any &s;hould object, that this knowledge is too often abu&s;ed by vain and light per&s;ons, who in&s;tead of admiring the wi&s;dom of God in the &s;ecrets of generation, do only make it their bu&s;ine&s;s to ridicule and &s;et them at naught. I readily grant it, and think it a very great unhappine&s;s that there &s;hould be a generation of &s;uch profligate per&s;ons in the world; but at the &s;ame time do aver, that this is no objection to this book; for &s;hall the &s;un be taken out of the firmament, becau&s;e its generating and lifegiving virtue, makes noxious weeds and poi&s;on|ous plants grow and flouri&s;h as well as the more &s;anative and medical herbs, and odoriferous and refre&s;hing flowers? It is not from the nature of the things them&s;elves, but from the vicious nature of corrupted men that the&s;e things come to be abu&s;ed. A harmle&s;s bee will fly into a garden, and there &s;uck honey from a flower, when a &s;pider, from the venomous malignity of its nature, &s;hall extract poi&s;|on from thence: So that it is not to be attributed to the book, that it is abu&s;ed by vain and lewd per&s;ons, but to the vicious nature of tho&s;e vain and lewd per|&s;ons that do abu&s;e it.</P>
<P>But perhaps &s;ince Ari&s;totle's Ma&s;ter Piece has al|ready obtained repute, why, at this time of day, we come to obtrude it as a new book upon the world, will be the mo&s;t material objection.</P>
<P>To this I an&s;wer, Fir&s;t, that tran&s;lations are alike free for every one to make. But, Secondly, having peru&s;ed tho&s;e &s;everal books that go by that name, I have &s;een none hitherto extant, exactly agreeing with the original, neither for matter nor method, which was a principal motive for me to attempt this
<PB N="8" REF="028209_0006_0FD720515D7DDDA0">
work in which, if tho&s;e who have had the peru&s;ing of it, be not very partial in what they have &s;aid, I may venture to affirm, that the accuracy and care that there has been taken of the tran&s;lation, and the method in which it is now pre&s;ented to the world&punc; has not only made it wholly new, but calculated i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> more for the reader's advantage, than any thing that has hitherto been publi&s;hed of this nature to the world. So that in this book alone, the reader may &s;atisfy him&s;elf, that he has the great Ari&s;totle's complete Ma&s;ter Piece.</P>
<P>I have one thing more to acquaint the reader with before I have done, which is that having met with a choice piece of that prince of phy&s;icians, Hippoc|rates, I could not forbear adding it by way of &s;up|plement to Ari&s;totle's Ma&s;ter Piece, as being both men highly eminent in their generation: For, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Ari&s;totle was highly e&s;teemed by Alexander the Great; &s;o that great prince Artaxerxes had &s;o high a value for Hippocrates, upon the account of his &s;in|gular &s;kill in phy&s;ick, that he proffered to honour him with the greate&s;t dignities of the Per&s;ian Court&punc; it he would have vouch&s;afed to have lived there&punc; Hippocrates cho&s;e rather to confine him&s;elf to a &s;ol|itary life, where he might pur&s;ue the various &s;ym|pathies and antipathies of nature, than to enjoy all the honours of the Per&s;ian Court.</P>
<P>I have been civil to the reader in acquainting him with what he &s;hould find in this treati&s;e; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> have no need nor no inclination to court him any farther; for if men will not know when they are well offered, let their own nece&s;&s;ities in&s;truct them better.</P>

<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>PART 1. Di&s;playing the <HI>SECRETS</HI> of <HI>NATURE. INTRODUCTION.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IT is &s;trange to &s;ee how things that are common are &s;lighted for that very rea&s;on, though in them|&s;elves worthy of the mo&s;t &s;erious con&s;ideration; and this is the very ca&s;e, as to the &s;ubject we are now to treat of. What is the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e more common than the begetting of children? And yet what is there more wonderful and my&s;terious than the pla&s;tick power of nature, by which they are formed? For though there be radicated in the very nature of all creatures a propen&s;ion which leads them to produce the image of them&s;elves, yet how the&s;e images are produced, after the&s;e propen&s;ions are &s;atisfied, is only known to tho&s;e who trace the &s;ecret meanders of nature in their private chambers, tho&s;e dark rece&s;&s;es of the womb, where the embryo receives formation. The original of all which proceeds from the fir&s;t com|mand of the great Lord of the creation, "Increa&s;e and multiply." The natural inclination and pro|pen&s;ion of both &s;exes to each other, with the pla&s;tick power of nature, is not only the energy of the fir&s;t ble&s;&s;ing, which to this day upholds the &s;pecies of mankind in the world.</P>
<P>Now &s;ince philo&s;ophy informs us that, "No&s;ce te ip&s;um," is one of the fir&s;t le&s;&s;ons a man ought to learn; it cannot &s;urely be accounted an u&s;ele&s;s piece of knowledge for a man to be acquainted with the cau&s;e of his own being, or by what &s;ecret power of nature it was, that coagulated milk (as a divine
<PB N="10" REF="028209_0008_0FD72057CAF8DE50">
author calls it) came to be tran&s;ub&s;tantiated into a human body. The explanation of this my&s;tery, and the unfolding the pla&s;tick power of nature in the &s;ecret workings of generation, and the formation of the &s;eed in the womb, is the &s;ubject of the following treati&s;e; a &s;ubject &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to be known by all the female &s;ex (the conception and bearing of chil|dren, being what nature has ordained their province) that many, for the want of this knowledge, have peri&s;hed with the fruit of their womb al&s;o; who had they but under&s;tood the &s;ecrets of generation, which are di&s;played in this book, might have been &s;till in the land of the living; for the &s;ake of &s;uch therefore, I have compiled this treati&s;e, which I &s;hall divide into two parts; in each of which I &s;hall ob|&s;erve this method: In the fir&s;t part I &s;hall,</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, Shew that nature has no need to be a&s;hamed of any of her works; give a particular de&s;cription of the parts or organs of generation in men, and afterwards in women; and then &s;how the u&s;e of the&s;e parts in the act of coition; and how appo&s;ite|ly nature has adapted them to the end which &s;he has ordained them.</P>
<P>Secondy, I &s;hall &s;hew the prohibition or re&s;tric|tion that the Creator of all things, and the Lord of nature has put upon man, by the in&s;titution of mar|riage; with the advantage it brings to mankind.</P>
<P>Thirdly, I &s;hall &s;hew when either &s;ex may enter into a married &s;tate, and be fit to an&s;wer the ends of their creation, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Fourthly, I &s;hall di&s;cour&s;e of virginity; and there|in &s;hew what it is, how it is known, by what means it may be lo&s;t, and how a per&s;on may know that it is &s;o, &amp;c.</P>
<P>In the &s;econd part, which chiefly relates to mar|ried women and the pre&s;ervation of the fruit of their womb, for the propagation of mankind to the world I &s;hall &s;hew,</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, What conception is; what is the prereq|ui&s;ite
<PB N="11" REF="028209_0009_0FD7205B0DE530A0">
therunto; how a woman may know when &s;he hath conceived and whether a boy or a girl.</P>
<P>Secondly, Shew how a woman that has conceived ought to order her&s;elf.</P>
<P>Thirdly, Shew what a woman ought to do, that is near the time of her delivery, and how &s;he ought to be then a&s;&s;i&s;ted.</P>
<P>Fourthly, I &s;hall &s;hew what are the ob&s;tructions of conception; and therein di&s;cour&s;e largely about barrenne&s;s, and &s;hew what are the cau&s;es and cure thereof, both in men and women.</P>
<P>Fifthly, direct midwives how they &s;hall a&s;&s;i&s;t women in the time of their lying in; bringing in &s;everal other material matters, proper to be &s;poken of under each of tho&s;e &s;everal heads; which will &s;ufficiently render this book what Ari&s;totle de&s;igned it, his complete Ma&s;ter Piece.</P>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I. A particular De&s;cription of the Parts or In&s;truments of Generation both in Men and Women.</HEAD>
<DIV4 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect;. <HI>1.</HI> Of the In&s;truments of Generation in Man, with a particular De&s;cription thereof.</HEAD>
<P>THOUGH the in&s;truments, or parts of genera|tion in all creatures, with re&s;pect to their out|ward form, are not, perhaps, the more comely, yet, in compen&s;ation of that, nature has put upon them a more abundant and far greater honour than on other parts, in that it has ordained them to be the means by which every &s;pecies of being is continued from one generation to another; and therefore, though a man or woman were through the bounty of nature, endowed with the mo&s;t angelick counte|nance and the mo&s;t exact &s;ymmetry and proportion of parts, that concurred together to the making up of a mo&s;t perfect beauty; yet, if they were defec|tive in the in&s;truments of generation, they would not, for all their beauty, be acceptable, either to the other &s;ex; becau&s;e they would be thereby ren|dered
<PB N="12" REF="028209_0010_0FD7205E38969280">
incapable of &s;atisfying the natural propen|&s;ions which every one finds in them&s;elves; and this methinks &s;hould be &s;ufficient to &s;hew the great hon|our nature has put upon them. And therefore &s;ince it is our duty to be acquainted with our&s;elves, and to &s;earch out the wonders of God in nature, I need not make any apology for anatomizing the &s;ecret parts of generation.</P>
<P>The organ of generation in man, nature has placed obvious to the &s;ight, and is called the Yard, and becau&s;e hanging without the belly is called Penis a Pendendo: It is in form long, round, and on the upper &s;ide flatti&s;h, and con&s;i&s;ts of &s;kin, tendons, veins, arteries and &s;inews, being &s;eated un|der the O&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">a Pubis, and ordained by nature for a two fold work, viz. For the evacuating of urine, and conveying the &s;eed into the matrix. The urine which it evacuates, is brought to it through the neck of the Ve&s;ica Urinaria, and the &s;eed which it con|veys into the matrix, is brought into it from the Ve&s;iculae Seminales. But to be more particular.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the common parts, as the cuticle, the &s;kin, and the membrana Carno&s;a, it hath &s;everal internal parts proper to it, of which there are &s;even, viz.</P>
<P>The two nervous bodies: The &s;eptum; the ureth|ra; the glands; the mu&s;cles; and the ve&s;&s;els. Of the&s;e di&s;tinctly in the order I have placed them, and fir&s;t, of</P>
<P>The two nervous bodies: The&s;e are called &s;o from their being &s;urrounded with a thick, white, nervous membrane, though their inward &s;ub&s;tance is &s;pun|gy, as con&s;i&s;ting principally of veins, arteries, and nervous fibres, interwoven together like a net. And nature has &s;o ordered it, that when the nerves are filled with animal &s;pirits, and the arteries with hot and &s;pirituous blood then the yard is di&s;tended&punc; and becomes erect; but when the flux of the &s;pirits <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e, then the blood, and the remaining &s;pirits are
<PB N="13" REF="028209_0011_0FD720656E6862E8">
ab&s;orbed or &s;ucked up by the veins and &s;o the penis becomes limber and flaggy.</P>
<P N="2">2. The &s;econd internal part is the &s;eptum lucid|um, and this is in &s;ub&s;tance white and nervous, or &s;inewy, and its office is to uphold the two lateral or &s;ide ligaments, and the Urethra.</P>
<P N="3">3. The third is the Urethra, which is only the channel by which both the &s;eed and the urine are conveyed out; it is in &s;ub&s;tance &s;oft and loo&s;e, thick and &s;inewy, like that of the &s;ide ligaments. It begins at the neck of the bladder, but &s;prings not from thence, only is joined to it, and &s;o proceeds to the glands: It has three holes in the beginning, the large&s;t whereof is in the mid&s;t, for that receives the urine into it; the other two are &s;maller, receiving the &s;eed from each &s;eminal ve&s;&s;el.</P>
<P N="4">4. The fourth is the glands, which are at the end of the penis covered with a very thin membrane, by rea&s;on of which it is of a mo&s;t exqui&s;ite feeling. It is covered with a preputium or fore&s;kin, which in &s;ome covers the top of the yard quite clo&s;e, in oth|ers not; and by its moving up and down in the act of copulation brings plea&s;ure both to the man and woman. The extreme part of this cover, which I call preputium, and which is &s;o Called <HI>a preputanla</HI> from cutting off, is that the Jews were commanded to cut o&s;t it on the eighth day. The ligament by which it is fa&s;tened to the glands is called fraenum or the bridle.</P>
<P N="5">5. The fifth thing is the mu&s;cles, and the&s;e are four in number, two being placed on each &s;ide. The&s;e mu&s;cles (which are in&s;truments of voluntary motions, and without which no part of the body can move it&s;elf) con&s;i&s;t of fibrous fle&s;h to make up their body; of nerves for the &s;en&s;es; of veins for the vital heat; and of a membrane or &s;kin to kn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t them to|gether, and to di&s;tingui&s;h one mu&s;cle from another, and all of them from the fle&s;h. I have already &s;aid, that there are two of them on each &s;ide&punc;
<PB N="14" REF="028209_0012_0FD7206894C21E10">
and I will now add, that one on each &s;ide is &s;horter and thicker; and that their u&s;e is to erect the yard from whence they have obtained the name of erec|tors. And having told you, two of them are thick|er and &s;horter than the other, I need not tell you that the other two are longer and thinner, only I take notice, that the office of the two la&s;t is to dilate, or if you will, open the lower part of the Ureth|ra, both for making water and voiding the &s;eed, and therefore are called accelerators.</P>
<P N="6">6. The &s;ixth and la&s;t things are the ve&s;&s;els which con&s;i&s;t of veins, nerves, and arteries; of which, &s;ome pa&s;s by the &s;kin, and are vi&s;ible to the eye, and others pa&s;s more inwardly; for indeed the ar|teries are di&s;per&s;ed through the body of the yard, much more than the veins, and this di&s;per&s;ion is contrarywi&s;e, the right artery being di&s;per&s;ed to the left &s;ide, and the left to the right; as for the two nerves, the greater is be&s;towed upon the two mu&s;cles and the body of the yard, and the le&s;&s;er upon the &s;kin.</P>
<P>What I have hitherto &s;aid, relates to the yard, properly &s;o called; but becau&s;e there are &s;ome ap|pendices belonging thereto, which when wanting, render the yard of no u&s;e in the act of generation, it will al&s;o be nece&s;&s;ary, before I conclude this &s;ection to &s;ay &s;omething of them; I mean the &s;tones or te&s;|ticles &s;o called, becau&s;e they te&s;tify the per&s;on to be a man: Their number and place are obvious; as to their u&s;e, in them the blood brought thither by the &s;permatick arteries, is elaborated into the &s;eed. They have coats or coverings of two &s;orts, proper and common; the common are two and in|ve&s;t both the Te&s;ticles; the outermo&s;t of the com|mon coats con&s;i&s;ts of the Cuticula, or true &s;kin, called Scorum, hanging out of the Abdomen like a pur&s;e; the Membrana Carno&s;a is the innermo&s;t. The proper coats are likewi&s;e two; the outer called Eli|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hroidis, or Vaginalis, the inner Albugenia; into the outer are in&s;erted the Crema&s;ters; to the upper
<PB N="15" REF="028209_0013_0FD7206AE779BA68">
&s;ide of the te&s;ticles are fixed the Epidymaides, or Para&s;tata, from whence ari&s;e the Va&s;a Deferentiae, or Ejaculatoria; which when they approach near the neck of the bladder, depo&s;it the &s;eed into the Ve&s;i|culae Seminales, which are each (for there are two of them) like a bunch of grapes, and emit the &s;eed into the Urethra, in the act of copulation. Near the&s;e are the Para&s;tatae, which are about the bigne&s;s of a walnut, and join to the neck of the bladder; the&s;e afford an oily, &s;l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ppe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y, and &s;alt humour to be&s;mear the Urethra, and thereby defend it from the acrimony of the &s;eed and urine.

with as much mode&s;ty and &s;obriety as will con&s;i&s;t with our &s;peaking intelligibly; for it is better to &s;ay nothing than to &s;peak &s;o as not to be under|&s;tood.</P>
<P>The external parts, commonly called Pudenda (from the &s;hamefacedne&s;s that is in women to have them &s;een) are the lips of the great orifice, which are vi&s;ible to the eye, and in tho&s;e that are grown, are covered with hair, and have pretty &s;tore of &s;pungy fat; their u&s;e being to keep the internal parts from all annoyance by outward accidents.</P>
<P>Within the&s;e are the Nymphae, or wings, which pre&s;ent them&s;elves to the eye when the lips are &s;ev|ered, and con&s;i&s;t of &s;oft and &s;pungy fle&s;h, and the doubling of the &s;kin placed at the &s;ides of the neck; they compa&s;s the Clytoris, and both in form and colour re&s;emble the comb of a cock, looking fre&s;h and red, and in act of coition receive the Penis or Yard between them; be&s;ides which, they g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ve pa&s;&s;age both to the birth and urine.

<P>The next thing is the Clytoris, which is a &s;inewy and hard part of the womb, replete with &s;pungy and black ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r within, in the &s;ame manner as the &s;ide ligaments of the yard; and indeed re&s;emble it in form, &s;uffers erection and falling in the &s;ame man|ner, and it both &s;tirs up lu&s;t and gives delight in copulation; for without this, the fair &s;ex neither de&s;ire mutual embraces, nor have plea&s;ure in them, nor conceive by them: And according to the great|ne&s;s or &s;mallne&s;s of this part, they are more or le&s;s fond of men's embraces; &s;o that it may be properly &s;tiled the &s;eat of lu&s;t.</P>

<P>The next thing is the pa&s;&s;age of the urine which is under the Clytoris, and above the neck of the womb, &s;o that the urine of a woman comes not through the neck of the womb, neither is the pa&s;&s;age com|mon, as in men, but particular and by it&s;elf. This pa&s;&s;age opens it&s;elf into the fi&s;&s;ares to evacuate the urine; for the &s;ecuring of which from cold or any other inconveniency, there is one of the four car|buncles, or fle&s;hy knobs placed before it, which &s;hut up the pa&s;&s;age; for the&s;e knobs which are in num|ber four, and in re&s;emblance like myrtle berries, and placed behind the wings before &s;poken of, quad|rangularly one again&s;t the other.

virgins, but in tho&s;e that have often u&s;ed copula|tion, it comes by degrees to be extingui&s;hed; &s;o that the inner &s;ide of the neck of the womb appears &s;mooth and in old women it becomes hard and gri&s;|ly. But though this channel be &s;inking down, writh|ed and crooked, yet it is otherwi&s;e in the time of copulation, as al&s;o when women are under their monthly purgation, or in labour, being then very much extended, which is a great cau&s;e of their pains.</P>
<P>The Clau&s;trum Virginale, commonly called the hymen, is that which clo&s;es the neck of the womb; for between the duplicity of the two tunicles, which con&s;titutes the neck of the womb, there are many veins and arteries running along, that ari&s;e from the ve&s;&s;els of both &s;ides of the thighs, and pa&s;s into the neck of the womb, being very large; and the rea&s;on thereof is, becau&s;e the neck of the womb re|quires to be filled with abundance of &s;pirits, to be dilated thereby that it may better take hold of the Penis, &s;uch motions requiring great heat, which be|ing made more inten&s;e by the act of frication, con|&s;umes a great deal of moi&s;ture; in the &s;upplying whereof large ve&s;&s;els are very nece&s;&s;ary. Hence it is, that the neck of the womb in women of rea&s;on|able &s;tature, in eight inches in lenghth. But there is al&s;o another cau&s;e for the largene&s;s of the&s;e ve&s;&s;els, (i. e.) becau&s;e their monthly purgations make their way through them, and for this rea&s;on women, though with child, often continue them; for though the womb be &s;hut up, yet the pa&s;&s;age in the neck of the womb, through which the&s;e ve&s;&s;els pa&s;s, is open. And therefore as &s;oon as you penetrate the Puden|dum, there may be &s;een two little pits or holes, and in which are contained a humour, and which being pre&s;t out in the time of coition, does greatly delight the fair &s;ex.</P>
<P>Though the&s;e we have already mentioned, are prop|erly the parts appropriated for the work of gener|ation, yet there are other parts, without which gen|eration work cannot be accompli&s;hed, of which
<PB N="19" REF="028209_0017_0FD720734B324D70">
we mu&s;t al&s;o give a de&s;cription, and the principal of the&s;e is the womb, which is the field of genera|tion, without which nothing can be done. The parts we have been already &s;peaking of, being or|dained by nature only, as it were &s;o many vehicles to convey the &s;eed into the womb, which being preg|nated therewith, by virtue of the pla&s;tick power of nature, produceth its own likene&s;s.</P>
<P>The womb is &s;ituated in the lower parts of the Hypoga&s;trion, being joined to its neck, and placed between the bladder and the &s;traight gut, &s;o that it is kept from &s;waying or rolling, yet hath it liberty to &s;tretch and dilate it&s;elf, and al&s;o to contract it&s;elf, according as nature in that ca&s;e di&s;clo&s;es it. It is of a round figure, &s;omething like a gourd; le&s;&s;ening and growing more acute towards one end, being knit together by its proper ligaments, and its neck joined by its own &s;ub&s;tance, and certain membranes that fa&s;ten it to the Os Sacrum and the mare bone. It is very different with re&s;pect to its largene&s;s in women, e&s;pecially between &s;uch as have had chil|dren, and tho&s;e that have had none. It is &s;o thick in &s;ub&s;tance, that it exceeds a thumb's breadth, and after conception augments to a greater proportion, and to &s;trengthen it yet more, it is interwoven with fibres, overthwart, but &s;traight and winding; and its proper ve&s;&s;els are veins, arteries and nerves; a|mong which there are two little veins, which pa&s;s from the &s;permatic ve&s;&s;els to the bottom of the womb; and two bigger than the hypoga&s;tricks, touching both the bottom and the neck, the mouth of the&s;e veins piercing as far as the inward concavity.</P>
<P>The womb, be&s;ides what I have already mention|ed, has two arteries on both &s;ides the &s;permatic ve&s;|&s;els, and the hypoga&s;tricks, which &s;till accompany the veins with &s;undry little nerves, knit and inter|woven in the form of a net, which are al&s;o extended throughout, even from the bottom to the pudenda them&s;elves, being &s;o placed chiefly for the &s;en&s;e of
<PB N="20" REF="028209_0018_0FD7207A969D7978">
plea&s;ure, &s;ympathetically moving from the head of the womb.</P>
<P>Here the reader ought to ob&s;erve, that the two lig|aments hanging on either &s;ide of the womb from the &s;hare bone, piercing through the Peritonoeum, and joined to the bone it&s;elf, cau&s;es the womb to be moveable, which upon &s;undry occa&s;ions, either fall low or ri&s;e high. The neck of the womb is of a mo&s;t exqui&s;ite &s;en&s;e, &s;o that if it be at any time di&s;|ordered, either with a &s;chirro&s;ity, too much flat moi&s;|ture, or relaxation, the womb is much &s;ubject to barrenne&s;s. In tho&s;e that are near their delivery, there u&s;ually &s;tays a mo&s;t glutinous matter in the en|trance, to facilitate the birth, for at that time the mouth of the womb is opened to &s;uch a widene&s;s, a is in proportion to the largene&s;s of the child, &s;uffer|ing an equal dilation from the bottom to the top.</P>
<P>Under the parts belonging to generation in wo|men, are al&s;o comprehended the preparatory or &s;per|matick ve&s;&s;els. The preparatory ve&s;&s;els differ no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> in number from tho&s;e in men, for they are likewi&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> four, two veins and two arteries: their ri&s;e and ori|ginal is the &s;ame as in men, differing only in their largene&s;s and manner of in&s;ertion; the right vein i&s;&s;ueth from the trunk of the hollow vein de&s;cending and the left from the emulgent vein; and on the &s;ide of them are two arteries which grow from the Arcata. The&s;e preparatory ve&s;&s;els are &s;horter in women than in men, becau&s;e they have a &s;horter pa&s;|&s;age, the &s;tones of the women lying within the belly but tho&s;e of a man without: But to make amend<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> for their &s;hortne&s;s, they have far more wreathings to and fro, in and out, than they have in men, that fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the &s;ub&s;tance they carry may be the better prepared. Neither are they united as they are in men, before they come to the &s;tones, but are divided into two branches, whereof the greater only pa&s;&s;eth to the &s;tones, the le&s;&s;er to the fecundated egg, and this is properly called conception. And then &s;econdly, to cheri&s;h and nouri&s;h it till nature has framed the

child and brought it to perfection. Thirdly, it &s;trongly operates in &s;ending forth the birth when its appointed time is accompli&s;hed; there dilating it|&s;elf in an extraordinary manner, and &s;o aptly re|moved from the &s;en&s;es, that no injury can accrue to it from thence retaining in it&s;elf a &s;trength and power to operate, and ca&s;t forth the birth.</P>
<P>The u&s;e of the preparing ve&s;&s;els is to convey the blood to the te&s;ticles, of which a part is &s;pent to the nouri&s;hment of them, and the production of tho&s;e lit|tle bladders which in all things re&s;emble eggs, through which the Va&s;a Preparantia run, and are obliterated in them. This conveyance of blood is by arteries, but as for the veins, their office is to bring back what blood remains from the aforementioned u&s;e.</P>
<P>The ve&s;&s;els of this kind are much &s;horter in wo|men than men, by rea&s;on of their nearne&s;s to the te&s;ticles; and yet that defect is more than made good by the many intricate windings to which they are &s;ubject; for in the middle way they divide them&s;elves into two branches of different magni|tude: for one of them being bigger than the other, pa&s;&s;es to the te&s;ticles.</P>
<P>The te&s;ticles in women are very u&s;eful; for where they are defective, generation work is quite &s;poil|ed; for though the&s;e little bladders, which are on their outward &s;uperficies, contain nothing of &s;eed, as the followers of Galen, &amp;c. erroneou&s;ly imagine, yet they contain &s;everal eggs, (about the number of twenty in each te&s;ticle) one of which being impreg|nated by the mo&s;t &s;pirituous part of the man's &s;eed in the act of coition, de&s;cends through the oviducts in|to the womb where it is cheri&s;hed, till it becomes a living child. The figure of the&s;e ova or eggs is not altogether round, but a little flat, and depre&s;&s;ed on the &s;ides, and in their lower parts are oval; but where the blood v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;els enter them, that is, in their upper part the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> plain having but one membrace about them, that the heat may have ea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">.</P>

<P>And therefore tho&s;e who do complain of marriage if they would but examine their own carriage and behaviour in it better, would find it is them&s;elves who make marriage &s;o unea&s;y; for as once Cicero &s;aid of old age, it was not old age, but the folly of old men, that made it &s;o burden&s;ome; &s;o I may &s;ay of marriage, it is not marriage, but the folly of per&s;ons married that makes it &s;o unea&s;y. If married per|&s;ons would but each take care to do their &s;everal and re&s;pective duties, there would be no complain|ing, nor would they find any condition more plea&s;ant or more profitable than a married life; there being more &s;atisfaction to be taken in the em|braces of a loving and cha&s;te wife, than in the wan|ton dalliances of all the &s;trumpets in the world; be|&s;ides the ble&s;&s;ings that attend the one, and that ruin, mi&s;ery, and heavy cur&s;e that always waits on the other.

<HEAD>&sect; <HI>3.</HI> At what age young men and virgins are capable of carnal copulation, and why they &s;o much de&s;ire it.</HEAD>
<P>Having &s;hewn the re&s;triction laid upon men and women, with re&s;pect to promi&s;cuous coition, and al|&s;o the plea&s;ure and advantage of a married life, I now proceed to &s;hew at what age young men and virgins are capable of the marriage bed; which becau&s;e &s;o many de&s;ire before they attain to it, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to &s;hew the cau&s;e of tho&s;e impetu|ous de&s;ires.</P>
<P>The inclinations of virgins to marriage, are to be known by divers &s;ymptoms; for when they arrive to ripe age, which is about fourteen or fifteen, then natural purgations begin to flow, and then the blood which no longer &s;erves for the increa&s;e of their bod|ies, does, by its abundance, &s;tir up their minds to venery, to which al&s;o external cau&s;es may excite them; for their &s;pirits are bri&s;k and inflamed when they arrive at this age, and their bodies are often more heated by their eating &s;harp and &s;alt things, and by &s;pices, by which their de&s;ire of venereal em|braces become very great, at &s;ome critical junctures almo&s;t in&s;uperable. And the u&s;e of tho&s;e &s;o much de&s;ired enjoyments being denied to virgins, is often followed by very dangerous, and &s;ometimes di&s;mal con&s;equences, precipitating them into tho&s;e follies that may bring an indelible &s;tain upon their fami|lies, or el&s;e it brings upon them the green &s;ickne&s;s or other di&s;ea&s;es. But when they are married, and tho&s;e de&s;ires &s;atisfied by their hu&s;bands, tho&s;e di&s;|tempers vani&s;h, and their beauty returns more gay and lively than before. And this &s;trong inclination of theirs may be known by their eager gazing at men, and affecting their company, which &s;ufficient|ly demon&s;trates that nature prompts them to de&s;ire coition. Nor is this the ca&s;e of virgins only, but the &s;ame may be ob&s;erved in young bri&s;k widows, who cannot be &s;atisfied without that due benevolence
<PB N="27" REF="028209_0025_0FD720AD70E37508">
paid them which they were wont to have from their hu&s;bands.</P>
<P>At fourteen years of age, commonly the men&s;es begin to flow in virgins; at which time they are capable of conceiving, and therefore fit for marriage though it would be much better, both for them&s;elves and their children if they married not till eighteen or twenty; and if they be very healthy and &s;trong of body, and always addict them&s;elves to temperance they may continue bearing till upwards of fifty, though generally they leave off about forty five: For the men&s;es flow a longer time in &s;ome than in others; but when they cea&s;e, they cea&s;e bearing. And therefore the bearing of I&s;aac unto Sarah at that age, may well be termed miraculous, becau&s;e it had cea&s;ed to be with her according to the cu&s;tom of women.</P>
<P>As for male youth, when they arrive at 16, or between that and 17, having much vital &s;trength, they may be capable of getting children; which ability, by the force and heat of procreating matter, con&s;tantly increa&s;e till 45, 59, 65, and then begins to flag, the &s;eed by degrees becoming unfruitful, the natural &s;pirits being extingui&s;hed, and the heat dried up. Thus it is with them for the mo&s;t part. But many times it falls out otherwi&s;e in particular in&s;tances; as once in Sweedland, a man who was married at a hundred years old to a bride of 30, had many children by her; but he was a man of &s;o hale a con&s;titution, and carried his age &s;o well, that &s;trangers would not have gue&s;&s;ed him above &s;ixty. And in Champania, where the air is clear and temperate, it is u&s;ual for men of eighty years old to marry young virgins, and have children by them; which &s;hews, that age in men hinders not procreation, unle&s;s they be exhau&s;ted in their youth and their yard &s;hrivelled up.</P>
<P>If any a&s;k why a woman is &s;ooner barren than a man? let &s;uch know, that the natural heat, which is the cau&s;e of generation, is more predominant in
<PB N="28" REF="028209_0026_0FD720AE48BE6F10">
men than women, for the monthly purgations of wom|en, &s;hew them to be more moi&s;t than men, and &s;o does al&s;o the &s;oftne&s;s of their bodies. And the man exceeding her in native hea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oncocts the humour into proper aliment, by the benefit whereof they are elaborated into &s;eed; but women though of a finer make, yet not being &s;o &s;trong as men, their facul|ties are thereby hindered in their operation.</P>
<L>Thus nature to her children is &s;o kind,</L>
<L>That early they tho&s;e inclinations find,</L>
<L>Which prompt them on to propagate mankind.</L>
<L>Hence 'tis, a virgin her de&s;ires can't &s;mother,</L>
<L>But re&s;tle&s;s is, till &s;he is made a mother.</L>

<HEAD>&sect; <HI>1.</HI> Of virginity, and wherein it con&s;i&s;ts.</HEAD>
<P>IN the la&s;t chapter I treated of the de&s;ire that young men and virgins have to mutual embraces, and at what age they are fit for them, have al&s;o &s;hewed that tho&s;e plea&s;ures are only to be enjoyed in a mar|ried &s;tate, and have al&s;o acquainted my reader with the advantage of &s;uch a condition, but &s;ince the de&s;ires of many, after mutual embraces, are &s;o im|petuous, that not having an opportunity to enter in|to a married &s;tate, they have anticipated the plea&s;|ures of matrimony, and lo&s;t their virginity before|hand, and yet perhaps, have afterwards pretended to bring their virginity to a marriage bed, by which means many an hone&s;t man has been deceived, and meretricious women e&s;caped with impunity; and, on the other hand, &s;ome virtuous young virgins, that have indeed come &s;uch into their hu&s;band's beds, have been accu&s;ed by the ignorance and incredulity of their hu&s;bands to have lo&s;t their virginity before|hand when there has been no &s;uch matter. There|fore to do right in this ca&s;e, to both parties, my de|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n in this chapter is to &s;hew, what virginity is,
<PB N="29" REF="028209_0027_0FD720B4C6A318C0">
and wherein it con&s;i&s;ts: How many ways it may be lo&s;t; and how a man may know whether it be lo&s;t or not, that &s;o women may not be wrongfully cen&s;ured, or men impo&s;ed upon.</P>
<P>Virginity untouched and taintle&s;s, is the boa&s;t and pride of the fair &s;ex, but they generally com|mend it to put it off: For as good as it is, they care not how &s;oon they are hone&s;tly rid of it. And I think they are in the right, for if they keep it too long it grows u&s;ele&s;s, or at lea&s;t lo&s;es much of its value, a &s;tale virgin (if &s;uch a thing there be) be|ing looked upon like an old almanack out of date. But to &s;peak to the purpo&s;e; virginity is the chief, the be&s;t, the fir&s;t, the prime of any thing, and is properly the integrity of a woman's privities, not violated by man, or not known by him; it being the di&s;tingui&s;hing characteri&s;tick of a virgin, that &s;he has not known man.</P>
<P>To make this more plain, I mu&s;t here ob&s;erve, that there is in maids, in the neck of the womb, a membranous production called the Hymen, which is like the bud of a ro&s;e half blown, and this is broken in the fir&s;t act of copulation with man; and hence came the word Defloro, to de&s;lower; whence the taking away of virginity is called the deflowering of a virgin; for when the ro&s;e bud is expanded, virginity is wholly lo&s;t. Certain it is, there is in the fir&s;t act of copulation &s;omething which cau&s;es pain and bleeding, which is an evident &s;ign of vir|ginity. But what this is, authors agree not. Some &s;ay it is a nervous membrane, or thin &s;kin, with &s;mall veins, which bleed at the fir&s;t penetration of the yard. Others &s;ay, it is the four carbuncles, knobs, or little buds, like myrtle berries, which are plump and full in virgins, but hang loo&s;e and flag|gy in tho&s;e that have u&s;ed copulation, being pre&s;&s;ed by the yard. Some have ob&s;erved a fle&s;hy circle about the nymphae or neck of the womb, with little ob&s;cure veins which make the membrane not to be nervous, but fle&s;hy. But &s;etting a&s;ide conjecture,
<PB N="30" REF="028209_0028_0FD720B754E8BCC8">
the hymen or clau&s;trum virginale, is a thin mem|brane interwoven with fle&s;hy fibres and endowed with many little arteries and veins, &s;pread acro&s;s the pa&s;&s;age of the bladder, with a hole in the mid&s;t for the men&s;es to flow, &s;o big that it will admit of the top of one's little finger; this is that which is called the zone or girdle of cha&s;tity; and where it is found in this form de&s;cribed it is a certain note of virginity; but in the fir&s;t act of copulation, it is nece&s;&s;arily violated; and then it is u&s;ually accom|panied with an effu&s;ion of blood; which blood is called the flower of virginity; and when once it is broken, it never clo&s;es again.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="2" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect;. <HI>2.</HI> How virginity may be lo&s;t. <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>In the former &s;ection I have &s;hewn (I hope to the &s;atisfaction of all mode&s;t enquirers) in what vir|ginity con&s;i&s;ts, and that it is lo&s;t by the fir&s;t pene|tration of the yard; which may be ea&s;ily known by its being attended with an effu&s;ion of blood upon the rupture of the hymeneal membrane, or Clau&s;|trum Virginale. But I mu&s;t do the fair &s;ex this piece of ju&s;tice, to let the world know that although, wherever this is found, it be an undoubted token of virginity, yet it will not follow, that where this is wanting, virginity is deflowered and lo&s;t; for the hymen may be corroded by acrimonious and fretting humours, flowing through it with the men&s;es; or it may be violated by the inver&s;ion, or falling out of the uterus, or of the vagina, or &s;heath, which &s;ometimes happens even to virgins; or (which I would have all virgins beware of, for the pre&s;erva|tion of their credit, and preventing all cau&s;es of &s;u&s;picion) perhaps the indi&s;creet or unwary bride had her men&s;es but a day or two before: In which ca&s;e both the hymen and the inner wrinkled mem|branes of the vagina are flaggy and relaxed, &s;o that no &s;uch rupture, and by con&s;equence, no &s;uch effu|&s;ion may happen. It were better therefore upon this account, that when virgins are about to marry,
<PB N="31" REF="028209_0029_0FD720C4115C5DD0">
they would fix the wedding day, at lea&s;t &s;ix or &s;even days after their men&s;es have done flowing.</P>
<P>But farther, to &s;ome nature hath given greater de&s;ires after enjoyment, than others; and to &s;uch, though they ab&s;tain from enjoyment, yet &s;o great is their lu&s;t and de&s;ire after it, that it may break the hymen and Clau&s;trum Virginale, and &s;ome|times it itcheth to that degree that they put in their finger, and &s;o break it. Sometimes the midwives break it in the birth; and &s;ometimes it is done by &s;topping the urine, coughing, violent &s;training, or &s;neezing: So though there be no bleeding at the fir&s;t penetration of the hu&s;band, it is not always a &s;ign of uncha&s;tity, or that another has been there before him, &s;eeing that the hymeneal membrane may be broken &s;o many ways; but where bleeding does follow, it is an evident and undeniable token that the per&s;on was a virgin, and had never known man before. And indeed though the hymen (or mem|brane &s;o called) may be broken all tho&s;e ways I have mentioned, yet it &s;o rarely happens to be broken any other way, that Leo Africanus makes mention of it as a general cu&s;tom of the Africans at their wed|ding that after the marriage ceremonies are over, the bride and bridegroom are &s;hut up in a chamber, while the wedding dinner is preparing, and an an|cient woman &s;tands at the door to receive from the bridegroom a &s;heet having the bloody tokens of his wife's virginity, which &s;he &s;hews in triumph to all the gue&s;ts; and then they may fea&s;t with joy: But if there is no blood &s;een, the bride is to be &s;ent home again to her friends with di&s;grace, and the di&s;ap|pointed gue&s;ts go &s;adly home without their dinner.</P>
<P>There are others that make the &s;traitne&s;s of their privities a &s;ign of virginity; but this is very un|certain: For this depends much upon the age, hab|it of body, and other circum&s;tances. But though it mu&s;t indeed be granted, that women who have u&s;ed carnal copulation are not &s;o &s;trait as virgins yet this cannot be a certain argument of virginity;
<PB N="32" REF="028209_0030_0FD720C41530E570">
becau&s;e after often repeated acts of venery, the priv|ities may be made &s;o &s;trait by the u&s;e of a&s;trin|gent medicines, that tho&s;e who tru&s;t to this &s;ign, may &s;ometimes take a whore in&s;tead of a virgin. And I have heard of a courtezan, who, though &s;he had been married, gave her&s;elf out to be a virgin, and by the help of a bath of comfrey roots, deceived tho&s;e with whom &s;he had to do.</P>

And what at fir&s;t is but concep|tion will i&s;&s;ue in a perfect birth.</P>
<P>Now in conception that which is fir&s;t to be re|garded, and without which it cannot <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e, is the &s;eed of the man that being the active principle, or effi|cient cau&s;e of the foetus, the matter of which is ar|terial blood, and animal &s;pirits, which are elabo|rated into &s;eed into the te&s;ticles, and from thence by proper ve&s;&s;els conveyed into the yard; and from whence, in the act of copulation, it is injected or emitted into the womb. The next thing is the pa&s;&s;ive principle of the foetus (for there mu&s;t be both in order to conception) and there is an ovum or egg impregnated by the man's &s;eed, endowed with a pla&s;tic or vegetative virtue; and upon the ovum being thus impregnated by the man's &s;eed, or being conveyed to it, the womb clo&s;es up, that no air may enter therein, but that the impregnated ovum may &s;well into a foetus.

<P>I have &s;hewn in the former &s;ection, that there are two things to be regarded chiefly in conception, to wit, the active and pa&s;&s;ive principle. This in part &s;hews, that difference of &s;exes is a prerequi&s;ite to conception. So nature has ordained there mu&s;t be a proper vehicle for the active principle to be in|jected thereunto, and there mu&s;t al&s;o be a pa&s;&s;ive principle to be impregnated thereby: Therefore as the man has no pa&s;&s;ive principle to be impregnated &s;o the woman has no active principle to impregnate, and therefore, without different &s;exes, there can be no conception.</P>
<P>But this is not all; for it is not enough that there

of mankind: And though &s;everal make u&s;e of coition to obtain this end, yet we find by experience, that in many it does not &s;ucceed, becau&s;e they order not them&s;elves as they ought to do: For though it mu&s;t be granted, that all our endeavours depend upon the divine ble&s;&s;ing; yet if we are wanting in any thing to our&s;elves, how can we expect that ble&s;&s;ing to &s;ucceed our endeavours? My bu&s;ine&s;s therefore in this &s;ection, &s;hall be to &s;how how women, that de&s;ire to have children &s;hould order them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t then, women that are de&s;irous to have chil|dren, mu&s;t in order thereunto, give them&s;elves to moderate exerci&s;e? for want of exerci&s;e and idle|ne&s;s, are very great enemies to the work of gen|eration; and indeed are enemies both to the &s;oul and to the body. And tho&s;e that &s;hall give them|&s;elves the trouble to ob&s;erve it, will find tho&s;e city dames that live high, and do nothing, &s;eldom have children, or if they have, they &s;eldom live; whereas the poor women that accu&s;tom them&s;elves to labour, have many children and tho&s;e &s;trong and lu&s;ty. Nor need we wonder at it, if we con&s;ider the benefit that comes by moderate exerci&s;e and labour; for it opens the pores, quickens the &s;pirits, &s;tirs up the nat|ural heat, &s;trengthens the body, &s;en&s;es and &s;pirits, comforts the limbs, and helps nature in all her ex|erci&s;es, of which procreation of children is none of the lea&s;t.</P>
<P>A &s;econd thing to be ob&s;erved by women in order to conception is that they avoid all manner of di&s;|content, and the occa&s;ion of it; for di&s;content is a great enemy to conception, and it &s;o di&s;pirit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> either man or woman that it hinders them from putting forth their vigour, which ought to be exerted in the act of coition, when, on the contrary, content and &s;atisfaction of mind dilate the heart and arteries, whereby the vital blood and &s;pirits are freely di&s;|tributed through the body; and thence ari&s;e &s;uch affections as plea&s;e, recreate and refre&s;h the nature of man, as hope, joy, love, gladne&s;s and mirth. Nor

do<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> it only comfort and &s;trengthen the body, but al&s;o the operation and imagination of the mind which is &s;o much the more nece&s;&s;ary, in&s;omuch as the imagination of the mother works forcibly upon the conception of the child; women therefore ought to take great care that their imagination be pure and clear, that their children may be well formed.</P>
<P>A third thing that women ought to take care of, to further conception, is to keep the womb in good order; and to that end, to &s;ee that the men&s;es come down as they ought to do; for if they are di&s;col|oured they are out of order: But if the blood come down pure, then the woman will be very prone to conceive with child, e&s;pecially if they u&s;e copula|tion in two or three days after the monthly terms are &s;tayed.</P>
<P>A fourth thing a woman that would conceive &s;hould ob&s;erve, is, that &s;he u&s;e not the act of coition too often, for fatiety gluts the womb, and renders it unfit for its office. There are two things demon|&s;trates this; that is, that common whores (who of|ten u&s;e copulation) have never, or very rarely, any children; for the gra&s;s &s;eldom grows in a path that is commonly trodden in. The other is, that tho&s;e women, who&s;e hu&s;bands have been long ab&s;ent, do, after copulation with them again, conceive very quickly.</P>
<P>A fifth rule is, that they take care the time of copulation be convenient, that there be no fear of &s;urpri&s;e, for fear hinders conception. And then it were be&s;t al&s;o that the de&s;ire of copulation be natur|al, and not &s;tirred up by provocation: And if it be natural, &s;he greater the womans's de&s;ire after copu|lation, is, the more likely &s;he is to conceive.</P>
<P>I will add no more; but what &s;ome authors re|port, that a load&s;tone carried about with the wom|an, not only cau&s;eth conception, but concord be|tween man and wife, which if it be true, I would have no married woman go without one, both for her own and hu&s;band's quiet.</P>

in colour, nature having now begun to work upon it, &s;o they may begin to renew their mutual endear|ments, but with a great deal of caution. In the next &s;ix days following, that blood begins now to be united into one body, and to grow hard, and be|comes a little quantity, and to appeal a round lump and as the fir&s;t creation of the earth was void and without form, &s;o is the creating work of divine power in the womb, this &s;hamele&s;s embryo lies like the fir&s;t ma&s;s. But in two days after, the principal members are formed by the pla&s;tick power of nature and the&s;e principal members, viz. the heart, the brain, the liver, and the te&s;ticles or &s;tones. Three days after the other members are formed, and are di&s;tingui&s;hed from the &s;houlders by the forming fac|ulty, the knees, and the heart, liver, and &s;tones, with their appurtenances, do grow bigger and big|ger. Four days after that, the &s;everal members of the whole body do appear, and, as nature requires they conjunctly and &s;eparately do receive their per|fection. And &s;o in the appointed time, the whole creation hath that e&s;&s;ence, which it ought to have to the perfection of it receiving from God a living &s;oul, therewith putting into his no&s;trils the breath of life.

<P>Thus the reader may &s;ee how authors differ herein, but this ought to be noted, that the different po&s;i|tions which the child hath been &s;een in, hath given occa&s;ion to the different opinions of authors; for when a woman is young with child, the embryo i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> always found of a round figure, a little oblong, hav|ing the &s;pine moderately turned inwards, the thigh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> folding, and a little rai&s;ed, to which the legs are joined, that the heels touch the buttocks, the arms bending, and the hands placed upon the knees, to|wards which, the head is inclined forwards, &s;o that the chin toucheth the break; the &s;pine of the back is at the &s;ame time placed towards the mother's and the head uppermo&s;t, the hands forwards and the feet downwards, and proportionable to its growth, it extends its members by little and little, which were exactly formed in the fir&s;t month. In this po&s;ture it u&s;ually keeps to the &s;eventh or eighth month, and then by a natural propen&s;ity and di&s;po&s;ition of the upper part of the body, the head is turned down|wards, the inward orifice of the womb, tumbling as

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. Of the ob&s;tructions of Conception, with the Cau&s;e and Cure of Barrenne&s;s, and the &s;igns of in&s;ufficiency in both Men and Women.</HEAD>
<P>WE have already inquired into many &s;ecrets belonging to the generation of man; and have treated largely about conception, which is one of the chief my&s;teries of nature. But before I pro|ceed any farther, it is highly nece&s;&s;ary that I treat of the nece&s;&s;ary ob&s;tructions of conception; which naturally leads me to treat of barrenne&s;s, which is the grand ob&s;truction of conception; and herein, for the &s;ake of all tho&s;e that de&s;ire children, I &s;hall &s;hew how it is cau&s;ed, and then how to be cured.</P>
<DIV4 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect; <HI>1.</HI> Of Barrenne&s;s.</HEAD>
<P>Seeing all grant, that the having of children is a ble&s;&s;ing, it will be ea&s;ily granted that bartenne&s;s is a cur&s;e. And &s;ince it is manife&s;ted that it occa&s;ions di&s;content between man and wife, and every woman looks upon it as a reproach to be barren, it will need no apology to enquire into the cau&s;e of it.</P>
<P>In &s;ome countries, before women were admitted to the marriage bed, they were &s;earched by the midwife; and tho&s;e only which &s;he allowed of as
<PB N="50" REF="028209_0048_0FD72118723C90B0">
fruitful, were permitted to marry. It mu&s;t needs therefore be a grateful piece of &s;ervice to the fair &s;ex, to &s;hew them how to turn the &s;tony ground un|to a fruitful &s;oil, that in&s;tead of being reproached with a barren womb, they may become the joyful mother of many children.</P>
<P>Barrenne&s;s is a natural and accidental defect which hinders conception; for that which hinders conception cau&s;es barrenne&s;s. Now, there may be &s;everal cau&s;es why conception may be hindered; as over much heat or cold drying up the &s;eed, and making it to corrupt; this extingui&s;hing the life of the &s;eed, and that making it wateri&s;h and unfit for generation. It may be cau&s;ed al&s;o by the not flow|ing, or by the overflowing of the cour&s;es, and by &s;welling ulcers, or inflammations of the womb, or by an excre&s;cence of fle&s;h growing about the mouth of the matrix, whereby the &s;eed is hindered from being injected into the womb; and want of love in the per&s;ons copulating, may al&s;o hinder conception, as is apparent from tho&s;e women that are deflowered again&s;t their will: No conception following any forced copulation.</P>
<P>And here let me caution parents again&s;t one thing that often cau&s;es barrenne&s;s, which might be ea&s;ily prevented; and that is, again&s;t letting virgins blood in the arm before their cour&s;es come down; the&s;e come down in virgins u&s;ually in the fourteenth year of their age, &s;eldom before the thirteenth, but never before the twelfth. Now becau&s;e u&s;ually young virgins are out of order before they fir&s;t break down the mother goes with her to the doctor, who finding that fullne&s;s of blood is the occa&s;ion of her illne&s;s, orders her to let blood in the arm; upon which &s;he becomes well for a time, the &s;uperfluous blood being taken away; and this remedy, which is &s;till wor&s;e than the di&s;ea&s;e, being repeated four or five times, the blood comes not down at all to the womb, as it does in other women, but the womb dries up, and is forever barren: Whereas, had &s;he been let blood
<PB N="51" REF="028209_0049_0FD7211A0DFEA828">
in the foot, it would have brought the blood down|wards, and &s;o have provoked the terms, and have prevented mi&s;chief.</P>
<P>Another cau&s;e of barrenne&s;s is for want of con|venient moderate quality, which the woman ought to have with the man; as if he be hot, &s;he mu&s;t be cold; if he be dry, &s;he mu&s;t be moi&s;t; but if they both be of a dry or both of a moi&s;t con&s;titution, they cannot propagate; though in this ca&s;e neither of them be barren, &s;ingly con&s;idered; for he or &s;he, though now as barren as the barren fig tree, yet joined to an apt con&s;titution, may become as fruitful as the vine.</P>
<P>Another ca&s;e in barrenne&s;s may be the di&s;u&s;e of copulation; for &s;ome there are of that frigid con&s;ti|tution, that they either u&s;e not the means at all, or el&s;e, perform it with &s;o much languor and coldne&s;s, that it is not likely it &s;hould prove efficacious; where|as as I have already &s;aid, the act of coition &s;hould be performed with the greate&s;t ardour and inten&s;ene&s;s of de&s;ire imaginable, or el&s;e they may as well let it alone, for as good never a whit, as never the better. But &s;ince nature teaches to do what they do in this kind vigorou&s;ly, this frigid di&s;po&s;ition is the effect of a cold di&s;temper, and mu&s;t be cured by &s;uch things as heat and nouri&s;h; and therefore &s;uch ought to eat and drink of the be&s;t, &s;ince the latin proverb tells us, Sine Cerere et Lib<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ro friget Venus.</P>
<Q><L>Without good drink and feeding high,</L>
<L>De&s;ire of Venus &s;oon will die.</L></Q>
<P>Such therefore ought to feed on cock &s;tones and lamb &s;tones, &s;parrows, partridges, quails, and phea&s;|ant eggs; for it is an infallible aphori&s;m in phy&s;ic, that what&s;oever any creature is extremely addicted to, they operate to the &s;ame end by their &s;eminal virtue in the man that eats them. Therefore part|ridges, quails and &s;parrows, &amp;c. being extemely addicted to venery, they work the &s;ame effect in tho&s;e that eat them. And this likewi&s;e is worthy to be noted, that in what part of the body the faculty
<PB N="52" REF="028209_0050_0FD7211BBA0A3338">
that you would &s;trengthen lies, take the &s;ame part of another creature, in whom that faculty is &s;trong, for a medicine; as for in&s;tance, the virtus procrea|tiva lies in the te&s;ticles, therefore cock &s;tones &amp;c, are medical in this di&s;temper. Let &s;uch per&s;ons al&s;o eat &s;uch food as is very nouri&s;hing, as par&s;nips, di&s;anders, &s;kirrits, and pine nuts: and let them take a dram of dia&s;atyron in an electuary every morning. The &s;tones of a &s;ox dried to powder, and a dram of it taken every morning in tent is al&s;o very good in this ca&s;e and &s;o al&s;o is a dram of &s;aty|rion roots, taken in like manner.</P>

<HEAD>&sect; <HI>2.</HI> Of the Signs of in&s;ufficiency of Men and barrenne&s;s in Women.</HEAD>
<P>After married per&s;ons have lived long together, and both &s;eem likely, and yet neither of them have had children, there often ari&s;es di&s;content between them; and both are troubled becau&s;e they know not on who&s;e &s;ide the fault is; and though authors have left &s;everal ways to know whether the man or the woman be defective, yet becau&s;e I cannot confide in their judgments, I &s;hall pa&s;s them by in &s;ilence, and rather lay down a few rules that may be depended on, than many that are uncertain. But I mu&s;t fir&s;t premi&s;e that the women are &s;ubject to &s;o many infirmities more than men, that the cau&s;e of barren|ne&s;s is oftener on their &s;ide than the men's; for if the man has the in&s;trument of generation perfect, being in health, and keeping a regular and temperate diet and exerci&s;e, I know no accidental cau&s;e of barren|ne&s;s in him; whereas the chief cau&s;e of barrenne&s;s in a woman lies in her womb, and the infirmities incident thereunto, &s;ome of which are the &s;topping of the men&s;trua, or their overflowing: As al&s;o the flux in the womb with the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">alling out thereof, and the inflammation, windine&s;s, heat and dryne&s;s thereof; for each of which we pre&s;cribe proper cures. But to be a little more particular.</P>
<P>If a man or a woman, in whom the in&s;truments of
<PB N="53" REF="028209_0051_0FD7211E4BEE42A0">
generation appear no way defective, would know whether the cau&s;e of barrenne&s;s be in them&s;elves, or their bedfellows, let them take a handful of bar|ley, or any other corn that will grow quickly and &s;teep half of it in the urine of a man, and the other half in the urine of the woman, the &s;pace of 24 hours, then take it out and &s;et it, the man's by it&s;elf, and the woman's by it&s;elf, in a flower pot, or &s;omething el&s;e, then water the man's every morning with his own urine, and the woman's with hers; and that which grows not at all, denotes the per&s;on to be nat|urally barren. Nor let any de&s;pi&s;e this trial; for if &s;eeing phy&s;icians will by urine undertake to tell a per&s;on of his or her di&s;ea&s;es, why &s;hould not urine al&s;o &s;how whether a per&s;on be fruitful or not? But if in a man the in&s;trument of generation is not perfect it will be obvious to the fight; and if the yard be &s;o feeble that it will not admit of erect<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">on, it can nev|er convey the &s;eed into the womb; nor can there be in &s;uch ca&s;e any conception. But this is plain and &s;o ea&s;ily di&s;cerned, that it mu&s;t needs be obvious to both parties; and that man that finds him&s;elf de|bilitated, ought not to marry; or if he does, he mu&s;t be contented if he finds his wife &s;eeking for that &s;at|isfaction which he is incapable of giving. It is true, that for a woman to &s;upply her hu&s;band's defects is contrary both to honour and virtue; but where a woman doth break tho&s;e bounds, on &s;uch occa&s;ions, the fault will lie in a great mea&s;ure, at the hu&s;band's door, though the wife cannot be held innocent.</P>
<P>The ca&s;e cannot be &s;o bad with the woman, though &s;he be barren, but that her hu&s;band may make u&s;e of her unle&s;s &s;he be impenetrable, which, though it &s;ome|times does, yet but very rarely happens: Therefore the man is more inexcu&s;able if he tran&s;gre&s;s.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides what I have already mentioned, &s;igns of barrenne&s;s in women are. If &s;he be of an over hot con&s;titution, of a dry body, &s;ubject to anger, hath black hair, a quick pul&s;e, her purgations flow but little, and that with pain, and yet has a violent de|&s;ire

<P>If barrenne&s;s proceeds from over much heat, let her u&s;e inwardly, &s;uccory, endive, violets, water lilies, &s;orrel and lettuce, with &s;yrup, and con&s;erves made thereof; thus,</P>

<P>If barrenne&s;s be cau&s;ed by the dryne&s;s of the womb con&s;uming the matter of the feed; let her take every day almonds and goat's milk, extracted with honey.

<P>It &s;ometimes happens that barrenne&s;s is cau&s;ed by remi&s;&s;ne&s;s in the manner of the act of coition, and though there be no impediment on either &s;ide, yet
<PB N="57" REF="028209_0055_0FD7213467D203F8">
if both &s;exes meet not in that act with equal vigour, no conception follows; for many times the man is too quick for the woman, or rather the woman too &s;low for the man: And tho&s;e that follow the opinion of the ancients, that the woman contributes &s;eed to the formation of the child as well as the man, are of opinion that there ought to be a joint emi&s;&s;ion both of the man and woman at the &s;ame in&s;tant; which admini&s;tering to both a very great delight, perfects the work of conception. But if in this ca&s;e the wo|man be &s;lack the man &s;hould follow the advice given in chap. iii. &sect; 2. where both &s;exes are &s;hewed how to manage them&s;elves in the act of coition; that &s;o by &s;tirring up in the woman a de&s;ire of venery, &s;he may meet his embraces with the greate&s;t ardour. But if this &s;hould prove ineffectual, let her, before the act of coition, foment the privities with the de|coction of betony, &s;age, hy&s;&s;op and calamint, and anoint the mouth of the neck of the womb with mu&s;k and civet; and the cau&s;e of barrenne&s;s removed, let the womb be corroborated by the following appli|cations.</P>

<P>I HAVE already &s;hewn how a young woman ought to order her&s;elf, and what &s;he ought to do pre|&s;ently after conception, in order to prevent mi&s;car|riage; and therefore &s;hall &s;ay no more as to that; my de&s;ign in this chapter, is to &s;hew how &s;he ought to govern her&s;elf during the whole time of her preg|nancy.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t then, let a woman, that is with child (if &s;he can) choo&s;e a temperate air, not infected with frogs&punc;

and for that rea&s;on, not near any mar&s;hy grounds, rivers, lakes, or ponds; but this in &s;ome cannot be avoided, their habitation falling out to be in &s;uch places; but tho&s;e that can live where they plea&s;e, ought to avoid &s;uch places, and &s;o they &s;hould like|wi&s;e the going abroad in too hot or too cold weather; as al&s;o when the &s;outh wind blows hard for that of|ten proves hurtful to a woman with child; and &s;ometimes cau&s;es abortion. Nor is the north wind much le&s;s hurtful, or le&s;s to be avoided, as cau&s;ing rheums, coughs, and catarrhs, which opening the body, often cau&s;e mi&s;carriages.</P>
<P>Secondly, She ought to be very cautious in the matter of her diet, choo&s;ing only tho&s;e meats that create whole&s;ome nouri&s;hment, and &s;uch as are mod|erately dry; and let her take care to prevent and avoid immoderate fa&s;ting, for that will weaken the infant, and render it of a &s;ickly con&s;titution, and &s;ometimes cau&s;es abortion. And as all the&s;e ex|ce&s;&s;es are to be avoided, &s;o &s;he mu&s;t take care not only of avoiding immoderate fa&s;ting but immoderate eating too, which will not only be apt to &s;tuff up the child, but to &s;well it up to that degree, that it will endanger the life of it&s;elf and the mother in its birth. Let it &s;uffice that in general, &s;he avoids all meats which are too hot or too cold and moi&s;t; &s;uch as &s;allads, &s;pices and hot meats, which often cau&s;e the child to be born before its time, and &s;ometimes without nails which fore&s;hews a &s;hort life. And therefore in this ca&s;e the mo&s;t whole&s;ome meats are pigeons, partridges, phea&s;ants, larks, veal, mutton, or any meat that yields a good juice, and contri|butes kindly nouri&s;hment: as al&s;o &s;uch fruits as are &s;weet, and of ea&s;y dige&s;tion, as cherries, pears, dam|&s;ons and the like. But let her avoid, as pernicious, all &s;uch things as cau&s;e and create wind.</P>
<P>Care al&s;o ought to be taken with re&s;pect to her exerci&s;e, which ought to be moderate; for violent motion, either in walking or working, is hurtful and di&s;turbing to the womb: e&s;pecially riding up|on

&s;tones in a coach, or any other uneven place and in like manner &s;hould all extraordinary &s;ounds and noi&s;es be avoided, e&s;pecially the ringing of bells, and the di&s;charging of great guns; neither ought &s;he to give way to immoderate laughing or weeping, or to anger, or any other pa&s;&s;ion; for that may be prejudicial to her.</P>

<P>Though the act of coition is that without which conception cannot be, yet the immoderate u&s;e of it hinders the chief end for which it was de&s;igned: In the fir&s;t four months after conception &s;he ought not to lie with her hu&s;band, or at lea&s;t &s;paringly, le&s;t by &s;haking the womb in that action, the cour&s;e would again be forced down.

<HEAD>&sect; <HI>2.</HI> What mu&s;t be done when the Woman's time of Labour is come.</HEAD>
<P>When the time of birth day draws near, and the good woman finds her travail p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> begin to come upon her let her &s;end for a midwife in time, better too &s;oon than too late, and get tho&s;e things ready which are proper upon &s;uch occa&s;ions: When the midwife is come, let the fir&s;t thing &s;he does, be to find whether the true time of the birth be come; the want of ob&s;erving this hath &s;poiled many a child and endangered the life of the mother, or at lea&s;t put her to twice as much pain as needed, for un&s;kilful midwives not minding this, have given things to force down the child, and thereby di&s;turbed the nat|ural cour&s;e of her labours; whereas nature works be&s;t in her own time and way. I do confe&s;s it &s;ome|what difficult to know the time of &s;ome women's la|bour, they being troubled with pains &s;o long before their true labour comes, by rea&s;on of heat in the reins, is known by the &s;welling of the legs. My advice to &s;uch women is to cool their reins before the time of their labour; which may be effectually done, by anointing the reins of their back with the oil of poppies, and violets, or water lilies, and thus they may avoid hard labour.</P>
</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="3" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect; <HI>3.</HI> Signs by which the true Time of a Woman's Labour may be known.</HEAD>
<P>When women draw near the time of their reckon|ing, e&s;pecially with the fir&s;t child, and perceive any extraordinary pain in their belly, they immediately &s;end for their midwife, taking it their labour, which is only cau&s;ed by the cholick, and proceed from wind; which pains, though they come and go, griping the whole belly, are without any forcing downward into the womb, as it is done by tho&s;e who go before labour.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="028209_0061_0FD721547818CF30">The &s;igns of labour &s;ome days before, are, that the woman's belly which before lay high, &s;inks down and hinders her from walking &s;o ea&s;ily as &s;he u&s;ed to do; al&s;o there flows from the womb &s;limy humours, which nature hath appointed to moi&s;ten and make &s;mooth the pa&s;&s;age.</P>
<P>But when &s;he is pre&s;ently fallen into labour, the &s;igns are great pains about the region of the reins and loins, which coming and retreating by inter|vals, an&s;wer in the bottom of the belly by congru|ous throws; and &s;ometimes the face is red and in|flamed, the blood being much heated by the endeav|ours &s;he makes to bring forth the child.

</DIV4>
<DIV4 N="4" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect; <HI>4.</HI> What is to be done at the time of Labour.</HEAD>
<P>When by the foregoing &s;igns concurring, the midwife is &s;atisfied that it is the true time of her la|bour; &s;he mu&s;t take care to get all things ready that are nece&s;&s;ary to comfort the travailling woman in that time; and the better to do that, let her &s;ee that &s;he be not &s;trait laced. She may al&s;o give her a pretty &s;trong cly&s;ter, if &s;he finds there be occa&s;ion for it; but with this provi&s;o, that it be done at the beginning, and before the child be too forward, for otherwi&s;e it would be difficult for her to receive it; the advantage of which cly&s;ter is, that the guts thereby will be excited to di&s;charge it&s;elf of its ex|crements, and the rectum being emptied, there will be more &s;pace for the dilating of the pa&s;&s;age; like|wi&s;e to cau&s;e the pains to bear more downwards, through the endeavours &s;he makes; other nece&s;&s;ary things for her labour will be put in order, both for mother and the child.</P>
<P>As to the manner of the delivery, various mid|wives u&s;e different ways; &s;ome are delivered &s;itting on a midwife's &s;tool; but, for my part, I think that a pallet bed, girded, and placed near the fire, that
<PB N="64" REF="028209_0062_0FD721558BBC12F8">
the good women may come on each &s;ide, that &s;he may more readily be a&s;&s;i&s;ted, is much the better way.</P>
<P>And if the labouring woman abounds with blood, it may not be improper to let her bleed a little, for by that means &s;he will both breathe the better, and have her breath more at liberty: And likewi&s;e more &s;trength to bear down her pain. And this may be done without danger, becau&s;e the child being now ready to be born, needs not the mother's blood for its nouri&s;hment any longer. And not only &s;o, but this evacuation does many times prevent her having a fever after delivery. Likewi&s;e if her &s;trength will permit, let her walk up and down her chamber; and the better to enable her thereto, let her take &s;ome good &s;trengthening things &s;uch as new laid eggs, jelly broth, or &s;ome &s;poonfuls of burnt wine; and encourage her to hold off her pains, bearing them down when they take her all that &s;he can. And let the midwife often touch the inward orifice with her finger, that &s;he may the better know whether the waters are ready to break, and whether the birth will follow &s;oon after, for generally the birth fol|lows in two hours after the afflux of the water; and to help it after, let her anoint the woman's privi|ties with emollient oil, hog grea&s;e and fre&s;h butter; e&s;pecially if &s;he find them too hard to be dilated.</P>
<P>Let the midwife al&s;o be near the labouring all the while, and diligently ob&s;erve her ge&s;tures, pains, and complaints, for by this &s;he may gue&s;s pretty well how her labour goes forward: For when &s;he changes her groans into loud cries it is a great &s;ign the birth is near; at which time her pains are greater and more frequent. Let her al&s;o &s;ometimes re&s;t her&s;elf on her bed to renew her &s;trength, but not too long at a time, for to lie too long at a time will retard her labour, and therefore it is better for her to walk about the chamber as much as &s;he can. If &s;he finds any &s;ick qualms, let her not be di&s;cour|ged; and if &s;he finds any motions to vomit, let
<PB N="65" REF="028209_0063_0FD7215B73FA1B48">
her not repre&s;s them, but rather give way to them; for it will, (however unea&s;y and irk&s;ome they be for the pre&s;ent) be much for her benefit; becau&s;e they further the pains and provoke downwards.</P>

<P>When the birth is long deferred after the coming down of the waters, let her ha&s;ten the birth by drink|ing a good draught of wine, where dittany, red coral, juniper berries, pennyroyal, and feverfew have been boiled.

<P>At fir&s;t let the woman be conducted to the pallet bed, placed at a convenient di&s;tance from the fire ac|cording to the &s;ea&s;on of the year, and let there be a quilt laid upon the pallet bed&s;tead, which is better than a feather bed, and let it have thereon linen clothes in many folds, with &s;uch other things as are nece&s;|&s;ary, which may be changed according as the occa|&s;ion requires it, that &s;o the woman may not be in|commoded with blood, water, and other filth, which is voided in labour. Then let her lay the woman upon her back having her head rai&s;ed by the help of
<PB N="66" REF="028209_0064_0FD72162808E3640">
a pillow, having the like help to &s;upport her reins and buttocks, that her rump may be high, for if &s;he lie low &s;he cannot well be delivered. Then let her keep her knees and thighs as far a&s;under as &s;he can her legs being bowed towards her buttocks, and let her feet be &s;taid upon a log, or &s;ome other firm thing. And let two women hold her &s;houlders, that &s;he may &s;train out the birth with the more ad|vantage holding in her breath, and forcing her&s;elf as much as po&s;&s;ible, in like manner as when &s;he goes to &s;tool. In the mean time, let the midwife encour|age her all &s;he can, and take care that &s;he have no rings on her hands when &s;he anoints the parts; then with her finger let her gently dilate the inward orifice of the womb, and putting her fingers into the entry thereof, &s;tretch them one from another when it pains her, by this means endeavouring to help forward the child, and thru&s;ting by little and little the &s;ides of the orifice towards the hinder part of the child's head, anointing tho&s;e parts al&s;o with fre&s;h butter, in ca&s;e it be nece&s;&s;ary. And when the head of the infant is &s;omewhat advanced in this in|ward orifice, it is u&s;ual among midwives to &s;ay, it is crowned; becau&s;e it both girds and &s;urrounds it like a crown: But when it is gone &s;o far, and the extremity begins to appear without the privy parts then they &s;ay, the child is in the pa&s;&s;age: And at this time the woman feels her&s;elf as if &s;he were &s;cratched or pricked with pins, and is ready to think that the midwife hurts her; whereas in truth it is only occa&s;ioned by the violent di&s;tention of tho&s;e parts, which &s;ometimes even &s;uffers alucration through the bigne&s;s of the child's head. When things are come to this po&s;ture let the wife &s;eat her&s;elf con|veniently to receive the child, which will now come very quickly, and with her finger ends, which &s;he ought al&s;o to be &s;ure to keep pared, let her endeav|our to thru&s;t the crowning of the womb back over the head of the child. And as &s;oon as it is advanced a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> far as the ears, or thereabouts&punc; let her take hold
<PB N="67" REF="028209_0065_0FD7216999B8A7E0">
of the two &s;ides with her two hands, and wait till the good pain come, and then quickly draw forth the child taking care that the navel &s;tring be not then entangled about the child's neck, or any other part as &s;ometimes it is, le&s;t thereby the afterbur|den be pulled with violence, and perhaps the womb al&s;o to which it is fa&s;tened, and &s;o either cau&s;e her to flood or el&s;e break the &s;tring, both which are of bad con&s;equence to the woman, and render her de|livery the more difficult. Great care mu&s;t be taken that the head be not drawn forth &s;traight, but &s;hak|ing it a little from one &s;ide to the other that the &s;houlders may the &s;ooner and ea&s;ier take its place immediately after it is pa&s;t; which mu&s;t be done without lo&s;ing any time, le&s;t the head being pa&s;t, the child be &s;topt thereby the largene&s;s of the &s;houl|ders, and &s;o be in danger of being &s;uffocated in the pa&s;&s;age, as it has &s;ometimes happened for want of care therein. But as &s;oon as the head is born, &s;he may &s;lide in her fingers under the arm pits, and the re&s;t of the body follows with ea&s;e. As &s;oon as the midwife hath in this manner drawn forth the child, let her lay it on one &s;ide, le&s;t the blood and water which follow immediately, &s;hould do it an injury, by running into its mouth and no&s;e, as it would do if it lay on its back, and &s;o endanger the choaking of it. The child being thus drawn forth, the next thing required is, to bring away the after burden, but before that, let the midwife be very careful to examine whether there be any more children in the womb: For &s;ometimes a woman may have twins; of which the midwife may &s;atisfy her&s;elf, both by the woman's throws and the bigne&s;s of her belly.</P>

And extraordinary care mu&s;t be taken that it be not drawn forth with too much violence, le&s;t by break|ing the &s;tring near the burden, the midwife be o|bliged to put up the whole hand in the womb to de|liver the woman, and &s;he had need take great care in this matter, that &s;o the womb it&s;elf, to which &s;ometimes this burden is fa&s;tened very &s;trongly, be not drawn away with it, which has &s;ometimes hap|pened.

The &s;moke of marygold flowers received up by the woman's privities, by a funnel, will bring away the after birth, though the midwife has lo&s;t her hold. Or you will boil mug|wort in water till it be very &s;oft, and then take it out, and apply it like a poultice to the navel of the woman in travail, it in&s;tantly brings away both the birth and the afterbirth; but as &s;oon as they come forth, it mu&s;t be in&s;tantly taken away, le&s;t it &s;hould bring away the womb al&s;o.</P>

<HEAD>&sect; 1. What unnatural labour is.</HEAD>
<P>Unnatural Labour is, when any unhappy acci|dent attends the birth, and when the child comes into the world in a contrary po&s;ition to that which nature hath ordained. When the child comes with its feet foremo&s;t, or with the &s;ide acro&s;s, it is quite contrary to nature, or to &s;peak more plainly, it is unnatural.</P>

<DIV4 N="2" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>&sect; <HI>2.</HI> Whence hard, difficult and unnatural labour proceeds.</HEAD>
<P>The fir&s;t an&s;wer to the que&s;tion that &s;ome put, why women bring forth their children with &s;o much pain? is, that it is the effect of the cur&s;e pronounced again&s;t woman, for her tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing the law of the Creator; for upon her &s;inning, it was pro|nounced as a cur&s;e again&s;t her, that in &s;orrow &s;hould &s;he bring forth her children.</P>
<P>But the natural and phy&s;ical rea&s;on hereof are that the &s;en&s;e of feeling being di&s;tributed to the whole body by the nerves; and the mouth of the womb being &s;o &s;trait, that it mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity be dilated at the time of her delivery; the dilating thereof &s;tretcheth the nerves, and from thence comes the pain: And therefore the rea&s;on why &s;ome women have more pain in labour than others proceeds from their having the mouth of the matrix more full of nerves than others.</P>
<P>Hard and difficult labour may proceed either from the mother or child, or from both; it may proceed from the mother by rea&s;on of a general indi&s;po&s;ition of her body; or from the indi&s;po&s;ition of &s;ome par|ticular part only, and that principally of the womb, which may be effected with &s;uch weakne&s;s, as ren|ders her unable to expel her burden.

<P>In ca&s;e the midwife finds a woman in difficult la|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">our, &s;he mu&s;t endeavour to know the particular ob|&s;truction, or cau&s;e thereof, that &s;o &s;he may apply a &s;uitable remedy. When hard labour is cau&s;ed by a woman's being too young and too &s;trait, the pa&s;&s;age mu&s;t be anointed with oil, hog's lard or fre&s;h but|ter, to relax and dilate them the ea&s;ier. But if a woman be in years, and has hard labour from her fir&s;t child, let her lower parts be anointed to mollify the inward orifice, which in &s;uch a ca&s;e (being more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hard and callous) does not ea&s;ily yield to the de&s;ti|nation of labour. And indeed this is the true cau&s;e why &s;uch women are longer in labour, and why their children in their birth are more &s;ubject to brui&s;es than others. Tho&s;e that are very lean, and have hard labour from that cau&s;e, let them moi&s;ten their private parts with oil and ointments, to make them more &s;mooth and &s;lippery, &s;o that the head of the infant in the womb may not be compre&s;&s;ed and brui&s;|ed by the hardne&s;s of its mother's bones in its pa&s;|&s;age. But if the cau&s;e be weakne&s;s, &s;he ought to be &s;trengthened, the better to enable her to &s;upport her pain.</P>
<P>If upon enquiry it appears that the &s;ecundine comes fir&s;t, let the woman be delivered with all con|venient &s;peed, becau&s;e then a great flux of blood will follow; for then the veins are opened. And on this account two things are to be minded&punc; Fir&s;t, whether the &s;ecundine advance forwards <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">uch or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ittle; if the former, and the head of the child fir&s;t

appears, it mu&s;t be directed to the neck of the womb as in the ca&s;e of natural births; but if there appear any difficulty in the delivery, the be&s;t way is to &s;earch for the feet, and by them it may be put by with a gentle hand, and the child taken out fir&s;t; but if the &s;ecundine advance, &s;o that it cannot be put back and the child follow it clo&s;e, then the &s;e|cundine is to be taken forth with much care, and as &s;wift as may be, and laid a&s;ide without cutting the entrail that is fa&s;tened to them, for by that you may be guided to the infant, which whether it be alive or dead, mu&s;t be drawn forth by the feet as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible; though this is not to be done by any means but in ca&s;es of great nece&s;&s;ity; for the order of na|ture is for the &s;ecundine to come la&s;t.</P>

<HEAD>&sect; <HI>4.</HI> Of the Delivery of a dead Child.</HEAD>
<P>In delivering a woman of a dead child, before any thing be attempted, the operator ought fir&s;t to be very certain that the child is dead indeed; which may be known by the falling of the mother's brea&s;ts, the coldne&s;s of her belly, the thickne&s;s of her urine, which is attended with a &s;triking &s;ediment at bot|tom, and no motion to be perceived in the child; al&s;o, when &s;he turns her&s;elf in her bed, the child &s;ways that way like a lump of lead, and her breath &s;tinks, though not u&s;ed to do &s;o. When by the&s;e and the like &s;igns, the operator is come to a &s;ettled judg|ment that the child is dead, let him apply him&s;elf to the &s;aving of the mother, by giving her tho&s;e things that are the mo&s;t powerful in the &s;aving na|ture in her operations; and which he has been be|fore directed to. But if through weakne&s;s the woman be not able to operate with nature, &s;o that a manual operation is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, let the operator carefully ob&s;erve the following directions, viz. If the child be found dead, with its head foremo&s;t, he mu&s;t take notice that the delivery will be the more difficult becau&s;e in this ca&s;e it is not only impo&s;&s;ible that the child &s;hould any way a&s;&s;i&s;t in its delivery,

but the &s;trength of the mother doth al&s;o very much fail her; and thereupon the mo&s;t &s;ure and &s;afe way for him, is to put up his left hand, &s;liding it as hollow in the palm as he can, into the neck of the womb, into the lower part thereof towards the feet, and that between the infant and the neck of the ma|trix; and then having a hook in the right hand, couch it clo&s;e, and &s;lip it above the left hand, be|tween the head of the child and the flat of the hand, fixing it in the bone of the temple, towards the eye, or for want of convenient coming at the&s;e, in the oc|cipal bone, ob&s;erving &s;till to keep the left hand in its place, and with it gently moving or &s;tirring the head, and &s;o with the right hand draw the child for|ward, encouraging the woman to put her utmo&s;t &s;trength, and always drawing when the woman's pangs are upon her. The head being thus drawn forth, the operator mu&s;t, with all &s;peed &s;lip his hand under the arm holes of the child, and take it quite forth, giving pre&s;ently to the woman a toa&s;t of fine wheaten bread, in a quarter of a pint of tent, to re|vive and cheri&s;h her &s;pirits.</P>

the after pain, cau&s;es &s;welling in the womb, and hurts the nerves; therefore if a woman has had very hard labour, it is convenient after delivery, to wrap her in the &s;kin of a &s;heep, taken off whil&s;t it is warm and putting the fle&s;h &s;ide to her reins and belly: Or if this cannot be &s;o well had, the &s;kin of a hare or rabbit, taken off as &s;oon as it is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">illed, may be ap|plied to the &s;ame parts; and by &s;o doing the dila|tion made in the birth will be clo&s;ed and the melan|choly blood expelled from tho&s;e parts.</P>
<P>After &s;he has been delivered a while, you may make a re&s;trictive of the yolk of two eggs; a quar|ter of a pint of white wine, oil of St. John's wort, oil of ro&s;es, plantain and ro&s;e water, of each an ounce, mix them together, fold a linen cloth and dip it therein, warm it before a gentle fire, and then apply it to the brea&s;ts, and the pains of tho&s;e parts will be gently ea&s;ed.</P>
<P>But be &s;ure let her not &s;leep &s;oon after her deliv|ery, but let her take &s;ome broth, cordial, or any other liquid matter that is nouri&s;hing, about four hours after delivery, and then &s;he may &s;afely be permitted to &s;leep if &s;he be &s;o di&s;po&s;ed, as it is prob|able &s;he will be, being tired with the fatigue of her labour.

If the womb be foul, which may be known by the impurity of the blood, and its &s;tinking and coming away in clotted lumps; or if you &s;u&s;pect any of the after birth to be left behind, (which may &s;ometimes happen, though the midwife be never &s;o careful and &s;killed) then make her drink of feverfew, pennyroy|al, mother of thyme, boiled in white wine, and &s;weetened with &s;ugar.

<P>Let the woman be &s;ure to keep a temperate diet; and take care &s;he does by no means overcharge her&s;elf, after &s;uch an exce&s;&s;ive evacuation; not be|ing ruled by, or giving credit to un&s;kilful nur&s;es who are apt to admoni&s;h them to feed heartily, the bet|ter to repair the lo&s;s of blood, for the blood is not for the mo&s;t part pure, but &s;uch as has been retained in the ve&s;&s;els or membranes, and is better voided, for the health of the woman, than kept, unle&s;s there happen an extraordinary flux of blood; for if her nouri&s;hment be too much, it may make her liable to a fever, and increa&s;e the milk to &s;uperfluity, which may be of dangerous con&s;equence.

<P>AS to a mole, or fal&s;e conception, it is called by Greeks Mole, from the load of heavy weight thereof; it being nothing el&s;e b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> ma&s;s, or great lump of fle&s;h burdening the womb. And it is defin|ed to be an inarticulate piece of fle&s;h, without any form; and therefore differs from mon&s;ters, wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ch are
<PB N="76" REF="028209_0074_0FD7218C4F71E738">
both Formata and Articulate. And then it is &s;aid to be a conception, but a fal&s;e one; which puts a difference between a true conception and a mole, and the difference holds good three ways. Fir&s;t, in the Genus; becau&s;e the mole cannot be an animal. Secondly, it differs in &s;pecies; becau&s;e it hath no human figure, and bears not the character of a man, And thirdly, it differs in the Dividuum; for it hath no affinity with any of the parts, either in the whole body, or any particles of the &s;ame.</P>
<P>This imperfect conception may be known to be &s;uch, it is di&s;cerned by the&s;e &s;igns. The monthly cour&s;es are &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, the belly is puffed up, and al&s;o waxed hard, the brea&s;ts &s;well, and the appetite is depraved.</P>
<P>A mole may be felt to move in the womb before the third month, which an infant cannot; nor is this motion of the mole the effect of &s;en&s;itive power therein, but only cau&s;ed by the faculties of the womb and of the &s;eminal &s;pirits, diffu&s;ed through the &s;ub|&s;tance of the mole; for though it is no animal, yet it has a vegetative life. But then the belly is &s;ud|denly &s;welled where there is a mole; but in a true conception the belly is fir&s;t contracted, and then ri&s;eth gradually.</P>
<P>The cure of the di&s;temper con&s;i&s;ts chiefly in expel|ling it as &s;oon as may be; for the longer it is kept the wor&s;e it is; and this many times cannot be ef|fected without manual operation, but that being the la&s;t remedy, all other means ought to be fir&s;t u&s;ed. Among&s;t which phlebotomy ought not to be omitted; for &s;eeing letting of blood cau&s;eth abortion, by rea|&s;on of its taking away that nouri&s;hment which &s;hould &s;u&s;tain the life of the child, why may not this vicious coption be by the &s;ame means deprived of that vegetative &s;ap, by which it lives? To which end, upon the liver vein, and then the &s;aphaena in both feet, fa&s;ten cupping gla&s;&s;es to the loins of the belly, which done, let the urinary parts be much mollified, and the expul&s;ive faculty be provoked to

the burden. And to loo&s;en the ligaments of the mole, take mallows with the roots, three handfuls; pelitory, camomile, violet leaves, meliiot, roots of fennel, par&s;ley, mercury, of each two handfuls; fenugreek and lin&s;eed, of each one pound; boil them in water and make a bath thereof, and let her &s;it therein up to the navel; and at her going out of the bath, let her reins and privities be anoint|ed with this ungent.

<P>Mon&s;ters are properly depraved Conceptions and are deemed by the ancients to be excur&s;ions of na|ture, and are alway vicious, either by figure, &s;itua|tion, magnitude, or number.</P>
<P>They are vicious in figure, when a man bears the character of a bea&s;t. They are vicious in magni|tude, when the parts are not equal; or that one part is too big for the other. And this is a thing very common, by rea&s;on of &s;ome excre&s;cence. They are vicious in &s;ituation, the eyes on the brea&s;ts, or on the legs, as was &s;een in a mon&s;ter born at Ravenna in Italy, in the year 1570. And la&s;tly, they are vicious in numbers, as when a human per&s;on hath two heads, or four hands, and two bodies joined, which was the ca&s;e of the mon&s;ter that was born at Zarzan, in the year 1750.</P>
<P>Mon&s;ters are &s;ometimes produced by the undue coition of a man and his wife when her monthly flowings are upon her; which being a thing again&s;t nature, no wonder that it would produce an unnat|ural i&s;&s;ue.

may be known from the con&s;ideration of &s;everal parts of the body. They ari&s;e from the power and dominion of &s;uperiour power over bodies inferiour. By &s;uperiour powers I under&s;tand the twelve &s;igns of the Zodiac, who&s;e &s;igns, characters and &s;ignification are as follow:

</LIST></P>
</FIGURE></P>
<P>All which are exactly pre&s;ented to the eyes by the foregoing figure.</P>
<P>It is here farthermore nece&s;&s;ary to let the reader know, that the ancients have divided the cele&s;tial &s;phere into twelve parts, according to the number of the&s;e &s;igns which are termed hou&s;es; and have placed the twelve &s;igns in the twelve hou&s;es; as in the fir&s;t hou&s;e Aries, in the &s;econd Taurus, in the third Gemini, &amp;c. And be&s;ides their a&s;&s;igning the twelve &s;igns to the twelve hou&s;es, they allot to each hou&s;e its proper bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t hou&s;e they give the &s;ignification of life.</P>
<P>The &s;econd hou&s;e has the &s;ignification of wealth, &s;ub&s;tance or riches.</P>
<P>The third is the man&s;ion of brethren.</P>
<P>The fourth is the hou&s;e of parentage.</P>
<P>The fifth is the hou&s;e of children.</P>
<P>The &s;ixth is the hou&s;e of &s;ickne&s;s or di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>The &s;eventh is the hou&s;e of wedlock, and al&s;o of enemies, becau&s;e oftentimes a wife or hu&s;band prove<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the wor&s;t enemy.</P>
<P>The eighth is the hou&s;e of death.</P>
<P>The ninth is the hou&s;e of religion.</P>
<P>The tenth is the &s;ignification of honour.</P>
<P>The eleventh of friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>The twelfth is the hou&s;e of affl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ction and woe.</P>
<P>All which are comprehended in the following three ver&s;es.</P>
<Q><L>Fir&s;t hou&s;e &s;hews life, the &s;econd wealth doth give,</L>
<L>The third how brethren, the fourth how parents live,</L>
<L>I&s;&s;ue the fifth, the &s;ixth di&s;ea&s;e doth bring,</L>
<L>The &s;eventh wedlock, and the eighth death's &s;ting.</L>
<L>The ninth religion, the tenth honour &s;hews,</L>
<L>Friend&s;hip the eleventh, and the twelth our woes.</L></Q>
<P>Now, a&s;trologically &s;peaking, a hou&s;e is a certain place of the heavens or firmament, divided by cer|tain degrees, through which the planets have their
<PB N="100" REF="028209_0098_0FD721F83AFCEFD8">
motion, and in which they have their re&s;idence and are &s;ituate. And the&s;e hou&s;es are divided by thirty degrees; and the&s;e &s;igns or hou&s;es are called the hou&s;es of &s;uch and &s;uch planets as make their re&s;i|dence therein, and are &s;aid to delight in them, and as they are depo&s;ited in &s;uch and &s;uch hou&s;es, are &s;aid to be either dignified or debilitated. For though the planets in their &s;everal revolutions go through all the hou&s;es, yet there are &s;ome hou&s;es, which they are more properly &s;aid to delight in; as for in&s;tance Aries and Scorpio are the hou&s;es of Mars, Taurus and Libra of Venus, Gemini and Virgo of Mer|cury, Sagittarius and Pi&s;ces are the hou&s;es of Jupi|ter, Capricorn and Aquarius are the hou&s;e of Saturn, Leo is the hou&s;e of Sol, and Cancer is the hou&s;e of Luna.</P>
<P>The body of man, as we have &s;hewed, is not only governed by the &s;igns and planets but every part is appropriated to one or other of them; &s;o accord|ing to the particular influence of each &s;ign and plan|et &s;o governing, is the di&s;po&s;ition, inclination and nature of the per&s;on governed.</P>
