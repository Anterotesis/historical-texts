<P>I Have thought much on tho&s;e few Lines you began to write to me; and do not at all wonder that you expect I &s;hould improve <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Opportunity to relieve you,&mdash;For &s;urely the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">rong Bonds of <HI>Friendship,</HI> with which we hav<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> for &s;ome Years been bound to each other (<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> there no Bonds of <HI>Grace</HI> at all) demand this, and how much more when the&s;e are add|ed?

For ble&s;&s;ed be God, <HI>Chri&s;t Je&s;us</HI> is &s;tronger than <HI>He</HI> and all his combin'd Legions; and he can't re&s;i&s;t his Power, tho' he has audaciou&s;ly &s;truck at his Honour, and endeavour'd to impede his ble&s;&s;ed Work in your Soul.

what I call <HI>Evidences</HI> of a <HI>Work of Grace.</HI> This <HI>Que&s;tion</HI> I could never fully verbally an&s;wer, when with you, which makes me now attempt to explain my&s;elf.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> then, I do know that God has by his <HI>Word</HI> and <HI>Spirit,</HI> convinced me of <HI>Sin, Original</HI> and <HI>Actual</HI>; that I was by Nature a Child of Wrath, an Heir of Hell, an Enemy to Him, and his Ways, yea, Enmity it&s;elf; <HI>Dead in Tre&s;pa&s;&s;es and Sins</HI>; and that I was both utterly, <HI>unable,</HI> and <HI>unwilling</HI> too, to help my&s;elf out of this mi&s;erable State, being aver&s;e to the Go&s;pel-Way of Salva|tion, wrought out by <HI>Chri&s;t.</HI> I plainly &s;ee the Cau&s;e of that Complaint, <HI>Ye will not come to me, that ye might have Life.</HI> God convinced me al&s;o that <HI>by the Deeds of the Law, no Fle&s;h living &s;hould be ju&s;tified,</HI> and that He and his Throne would be &s;potle&s;s forever tho' He &s;hould ca&s;t me off, and condemn me to the hotte&s;t Hell: Since He ow'd me nothing nor was any Way bound to be&s;tow his Grace upon me; and if he did, it would be ab&s;olutely free and &s;overeign.&mdash;GOD &s;hew'd me I was, utterly unworthy that he &s;hould help me.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s, tho' I had thus de&s;troyed my&s;elf, yet in <HI>Him</HI> was my Help. Yea He <HI>di&s;cover'd to me,</HI> that <HI>he had laid Help</HI> upon <HI>ONE</HI> who is <HI>mighty to &s;ave to the uttermo&s;t all that come to God by Him</HI>; even a glorious CHRIST the Great EMANUEL God-Man, even one Co-equal with Him&s;elf, <HI>the expre&s;s Image of his Per&s;on&punc; in whom dwells, all the Fulne&s;s of the Godhead bodily</HI>;

One every Way compleat and &s;uited to all my wants; and that He was not only thus qualify'd and &s;ealed and &s;ent by the FATHER, but that he was ab&s;olutely <HI>willing</HI> as well as <HI>able</HI> to accom|pli&s;h the great Work; and would by no means ca&s;t out any that come to him.</P>
<P>Well upon <HI>this Di&s;covery</HI> of the amiable and lovely JESUS, if I know that I have a Being, I do know that God compell'd or <HI>&s;weetly con&s;train|ed me</HI> to <HI>throw down</HI> the Weapons of my Rebellion and to <HI>&s;ubmit</HI> to HIM as <HI>Prince</HI> and <HI>Saviour,</HI> and <HI>con&s;ent</HI> to be &s;aved by him in his own way, and upon his own Terms; that he &s;hould be the <HI>Al|pha</HI> and the <HI>Omega,</HI> the Foundation and the Top&s;tone in my Salvation. Yea, God <HI>caus'd my Heart to go out after Him</HI> in &s;trong and <HI>vehement De&s;ires,</HI> and to <HI>choo&s;e Him</HI> in <HI>all his Offices,</HI> with <HI>all his Benefits,</HI> to be <HI>my Portion</HI> forever. Yea <HI>He appear'd to me</HI> to be <HI>in Him&s;elf the mo&s;t love|ly and de&s;irable Object,</HI> the faire&s;t of ten thou&s;and Fairs: and God enabled me to <HI>give my&s;elf,</HI> my <HI>whole Soul and Body</HI> with <HI>all my Concerns</HI> for Time and Eternity into his merciful and faithful Hands: and had I a thou&s;and precious Souls, I would gladly venture them all with him; for <HI>I am per|&s;waded</HI> he will keep by his mighty Power what I have committed to his Charge; nor &s;hall all the Ho&s;ts of Hell, ever be able to pluck me out of his Hands.</P>
<P>But to proceed; upon <HI>this choice,</HI> and <HI>&s;urren|der</HI> to CHRIST as <HI>Mediator,</HI> GOD the FATHER <HI>manife&s;ted</HI> him&s;elf to me, as my reconciled GOD
<PB N="6" REF="007523_0006_102BA026F107C5E8">
and <HI>Father</HI>; the <HI>ble&s;&s;ed</HI> SPIRIT took up his a|bode with me, afforded me his Influences and A&s;|&s;i&s;tance daily; and God made with me an <HI>ever|la&s;ting Covenant,</HI> never to be forgotten, <HI>Even the &s;ure Mercies of David</HI>: and <HI>I &s;olemnly gave my&s;elf up,</HI> all I have, am, or can do, both in Life and Death, in Time, and for Eternity, to GOD the FATHER, SON and HOLY GHOST, to be his own, in a Covenant Way, to be di&s;po&s;ed of as &s;hall mo&s;t con&s;i&s;t with his Glory; and cho&s;e the glorious TRINITY for my <HI>Portion</HI> forever, in oppo&s;ition to all Others, even a GOD of infinite Perfections. Oh happy Choice! oh happy I, that I liv'd to &s;ee that Day wherein GOD betroth'd me to him|&s;elf in loving Kindne&s;s and tender Mercy!</P>
<P>Thus I was <HI>effectually called</HI> and <HI>made willing</HI> in the Day of GOD'S Power to <HI>receive</HI> Him: and <HI>to as many as receiv'd Him to them gave He Pow|er to become the Sons of God, even to tho&s;e that believe on his Name.</HI></P>
<P>And now the <HI>Foundation</HI> of my <HI>Hopes</HI> are laid upon the <HI>Rock of Ages.</HI> And agreeable to tho&s;e covenant Engagements, a faithfull GOD, has ever &s;ince dealt with me.

<PB N="7" REF="007523_0007_102BA02913E1B8C0">
as tho' my whole Salvation depended thereon while at the &s;ame Time, he will not &s;uffer me to depend on any thing but CHRIST alone; not|with&s;tanding a &s;trong <HI>Proper&s;ity</HI> to cleave to the <HI>Covenant of Works</HI>; but enables me to <HI>account all Things as Lo&s;s and Dung and filtby Rags, in point of Ju&s;tification</HI>; nor would I for a Million Worlds appear before GOD, in the be&s;t Perfor|mance I ever did: No 'tis in <HI>that &s;potle&s;s Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> which CHRIST has wrought out, im|puted to me, and in that only I dare appear be|fore GOD. But he gives me to &s;ee a <HI>Beauty</HI> in <HI>Holine&s;s,</HI> which far exceeds the Lu&s;tre of all created Things. Nor do I know what De&s;ire means, after any, or all the <HI>Enjoyments</HI> of <HI>Time</HI> and <HI>Sen&s;e, compar'd</HI> with tho&s;e ardent <HI>Longings,</HI> and <HI>Pantings,</HI> which He at &s;ometimes excites in my Soul, after the <HI>Enjoyment</HI> of <HI>Him&s;elf</HI>; and for <HI>&s;anctifying Grace.</HI></P>
<P>And tho' Grace is not always alike in Exerci&s;e; (no I am &s;ometimes dull and lifele&s;s as to Exerci&s;e) yet ble&s;&s;ed be GOD its has been the habitual, and &s;ettled Bent of my Soul for many Years; to choo&s;e GOD, his CHRIST, and <HI>Grace</HI> for my Por|tion in all Conditions, both adver&s;e and pro&s;per|ous. Ble&s;&s;ed be GOD, my Faith has not been &s;tagger'd. Sometimes He has bereav'd, cut off the Streams of earthly Comforts, one after ano|ther; and then cau&s;ed me to ju&s;tify him, and fly to <HI>Him</HI> as my all. Sometimes He has hid his Face, and cau&s;ed me to mourn after <HI>Him,</HI> and, refu&s;e all Comfort till <HI>He,</HI> return'd. Sometimes

He has permitted <HI>Satan</HI> to tempt and tyranize over me for a Sea&s;on; and many a precious <HI>Jewel</HI> has he &s;tolen from me by clouding my Evi|dences and infinuating that all was Delu&s;ion and Hypocri&s;y; and how many di&s;tre&s;&s;ing gloomy Days I have had GOD only knows: but <HI>Satan</HI> could not keep, <HI>them</HI>; for a faithful GOD would not &s;uffer me to be tempted above that I was a|ble, but made way for my e&s;cape.</P>
<P>Sometimes He has permitted the <HI>Remains</HI> of <HI>indwelling Corruption</HI> to rally all its Force and &s;trive for Ma&s;tery; but at the &s;ame time &s;tir'd up an inveterate Hatred and an Abhorrance of it, and my&s;elf for it, becau&s;e 'tis the abominable Thing which His Soul hates.
