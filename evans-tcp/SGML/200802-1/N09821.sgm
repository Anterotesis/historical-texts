<P>As we acknowledge the being and per|fections of God; &s;o we receive the doctrine of a univer&s;al providence&mdash;<HI>that the Lord reigneth</HI>&mdash;that his providential kingdom ruleth over all&mdash;and that he <HI>worketh all things according to the coun&s;el of his own will.</HI><NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Eph. 1. 11.</NOTE></P>
<P>IF a &s;parrow falls not to the ground with|out his providence; we may conclude, tho&s;e more important changes which pa&s;s over men, are under his ordering and direction.</P>
<P>'TIS the in&s;truction of wi&s;dom, that we &s;hould <HI>acknowledge God in all our ways; that our &s;teps may be directed by him.</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Prov. 3. 6.</NOTE></P>
<P>THE right management of the important concerns of this day,&mdash;reminds us of our duty in this re&s;pect.&mdash;And a ble&s;&s;ed pri|vilege it is, that we may have acce&s;s through a Mediator, to that glorious Being who is the fountain of knowledge; and humbly a&s;k <HI>for;</HI> and believingly expect the be&s;tow|ment <HI>of,&mdash;that wi&s;dom which is profitable to</HI>

<HI>direct&mdash;even that wi&s;dom of the prudent, which is to under&s;tand his way</HI>&mdash;that our public affairs being under divine&punc; direction, may be crowned with de&s;ired &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>IF the &s;un of pro&s;perity has been made to &s;hine upon us&mdash;or the day is become gloo|my and dark&mdash;we are to con&s;ider the&s;e e|vents, as taking place, under the providential government of the &s;upreme Ruler of the world; who <HI>wills many changes for us,</HI> tho' he is him&s;elf unchangeable.</P>
<P>IN the words before us, we are taught, that, <HI>The King's heart is in the hand of the Lord, as the Rivers of water</HI>&mdash;<HI>He</HI> &s;etteth up Kings, who formed the Rivers, and di|rected what cour&s;es the water &s;hould run in&mdash;Not, that the hearts of &s;ubordinate Rulers, or of all men, are not in his hands; but, that tho&s;e who are exalted as gods among men, who are &s;eated at the upper end of the world; are yet under the government of the Mo&s;t High.</P>
<P>HE makes u&s;e of men as in&s;truments in his hands, to execute the purpo&s;es of his providence and grace.&mdash;Men may be &s;et up by him as Kings, advanced to the chief &s;eat of government, under the influence and di|rection of his providence&mdash;And the ble&s;&s;ings

of their admini&s;tration, may be as u&s;eful and beneficial as Rivers of water.</P>
<P>As <HI>the heart of the King is in the hand of the Lord, as the Rivers of water</HI>&mdash;&s;o 'tis added&mdash;<HI>He turneth it whither&s;oever he will</HI>&mdash;that is&mdash;He turneth the King's heart as he plea&s;eth&mdash;'Tis more under his direction and controul, than the Rivers of water are under the power of men, which may be turned into different channels by them.</P>
<P>Now, as a King implies a kingdom and &s;ubjects, government and the admini&s;tration of it&mdash;And as Rivers of water have their important u&s;e and end in the kingdom of nature;&mdash;And as both of the&s;e are &s;aid to be in the hand of the Lord, given by him for valuable purpo&s;es&mdash;I hope the <HI>Metaphors</HI> will not be over&s;trained, if we allow the words to &s;ugge&s;t to us the following truths.</P>
<P><HI>THE univer&s;al dominion of God, that all hearts, times, &s;ea&s;ons, changes and events are in his hands, or under his direction and controul.&mdash;The origin, de&s;ign, im|portance, nece&s;&s;ity and advantage of good civil government&mdash;The happy ca&s;e of a people, who are thus favoured of God, for they are as a land well watered with rivers, and enjoy privileges which are</HI>

<HI>great and invaluable.&mdash;A good civil government may be altered, the Rivers of water may be turned into other chan|nels, or may become bitter; or the ad|mini&s;tration of government may become injurious and oppre&s;&s;ive to the &s;ubject&mdash;And in both the&s;e ca&s;es&mdash;either when we enjoy the advantages of good civil government, or find that it is altered and become grievous&mdash;we are to acknowledge the righteous and &s;upreme Ruler and Governor of the world, who orders pro&s;perity and adver&s;ity for us; and can turn the rivers of water into their right channels, when they have been diverted from their proper cour&s;es; or remove all our public difficulties, and make us a happy people.</HI></P>
<P>I WOULD take &s;ome notice of each o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> the&s;e.</P>
<P>IN the fir&s;t place. The words &s;ugge&s;t to us&mdash;<HI>The univer&s;al dominion of God, that all hearts, times, &s;ea&s;ons, changes and events, an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> in his hands, or under his direction and con|troul.</HI></P>
<P><HI>THE King's heart is in the hand of the Lord.</HI> By the heart here, is intended, the mind, will and affections&mdash;the King him&s;elf&punc;

with all his &s;ecret &s;prings of action, with all his arcana imperii, or &s;ecrets of government, whatever he is&mdash;whatever he has&mdash;whatever he does.

<P>AND as the great Ruler of the univer&s;e, has the hearts of Kings, &s;o he has the go|vernment of Kingdoms in his hands. He who made the world governs it&mdash;All events in the kingdom of nature, providence and grace, are under his ordering and direction.

<P>ALTHOUGH there is &s;o much &s;in in the world, yet a righteous and holy God reigns. Although he is infinitely di&s;tant from all &s;in, yet he has permitted it to come into his creation, and abound among men. This is the day of his patience, which is exerci&s;ed even unto long-&s;uffering; and he knows how to govern and over-rule all events, to the advancement of his own glory, and good of his people.</P>

<P>IN a &s;econd Place, I come to take no|tice&mdash;<HI>That the words &s;ugge&s;t to us, the ori|gin, de&s;ign, importance, nece&s;&s;ity and ad|vantage of good civil government among men.</HI></P>
<P>THESE things are intimated, by a King's being &s;et up among men, by the King of Kings, for the purpo&s;es of government&mdash;And the ble&s;&s;ings of a good admini&s;tration de&s;cribed by Rivers of water which were form'd by him, and de&s;igned for the bene|fit of mankind.</P>
<P>IN the language of the Prophets,&mdash;Wa|ters often denote a great multitude of peo|ple. Thus the Prophet has it&mdash;<HI>The Lord bringeth upon them the waters of the river,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"></NOTE> that is&mdash;The A&s;&s;yrian army.&mdash;And &s;o the ble&s;&s;ings which flow down to a people, from the <HI>throne, when it is e&s;tabli&s;hed by righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> are beautifully illu&s;trated by Rivers of water&punc; which have their u&s;e in the Kingdom of nature, and &s;erve important purpo&s;es among men.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="012502_0012_0F8A8FE6DA610958">
A LAND without water, without Rivers of water, wou'd &s;carce be habitable, and &s;erve, but for a retreat for wild bea&s;ts.</P>
<P>THE great country of <HI>Egypt,</HI> receives its &s;upply of water from a River. Its fertility is owing to the flowings of the <HI>Nile,</HI> which diffu&s;es it's fatne&s;s through all their fields, being let into them by proper <HI>Ca|nals;</HI> whereby they yield plenty of grain; which otherwi&s;e would be but burning blowing &s;ands.</P>
<P>A PEOPLE without civil government, or in a &s;tate of nature, are in an un&s;afe condi|tion.&mdash;The depraved wicked world we live in, renders civil government nece&s;&s;ary, for the &s;afety and welfare of &s;ociety.</P>
<P>THROW down the walls of civil govern|ment, and to what evils and dangers, thefts, rapines and murders are we continually ex|po&s;ed? We could not call any thing we po&s;&s;e&s;s'd our own; for he who had the longe&s;t &s;word, would plunder for him&s;elf. We could not be &s;afe, from tho&s;e who thought they might injure us in our mo&s;t valuable intere&s;ts, and yet e&s;cape unpuni&s;hed.</P>
<P>THE con&s;equences of an arbitrary tyran|nic government, are yet more di&s;tre&s;&s;ing&mdash;
<PB N="14" REF="012502_0013_0F8A8FE791E544B0">
When the will of the Prince is the law of the Subject&mdash;When life, liberty, and pro|perty lie at the mercy of a <HI>De&s;pot;</HI>&mdash;And the nod of the tyrant brings on an execu|tion, by the <HI>bow</HI> and the <HI>&s;tring.</HI> Such an admini&s;tration of government is like an inundation or landflood, which carries all before it&mdash;The &s;ubject is left to <HI>groan</HI> in poverty, &s;lavery and mi&s;ery.&mdash;</P>
<P>THE ble&s;&s;ings a people enjoy who are favored with good civil government, are not to be de&s;cribed&mdash;they are like Rivers of wa|ter, reviving and refre&s;hing&mdash;Highly fa|vored of God, are a people who are thus di&s;tingui&s;hed!</P>
<P>This leads me,</P>
<P>IN a third place&mdash;to take notice&mdash;that the words &s;ugge&s;t to us, <HI>The happy ca&s;e of a people, who are thus favored of God, for they are as a land well watered with Ri|vers, and enjoy mo&s;t valuable privileges.</HI></P>

Yea the ble&s;&s;ed God him|&s;elf, is &s;aid to be to his church and people, a place of <HI>broad Rivers and Streams.</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">I&s;aiah 33. 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE></P>
<P>As the word and ordinances of God are ble&s;&s;ings to his church and people, which are de&s;cribed by <HI>&s;treams</HI> and <HI>rivers</HI>&mdash;&s;o the ble&s;&s;ings of good civil government, are beauti|fully repre&s;ented, by the &s;ame metaphor, <HI>when judgment runs down as waters, and righteou&s;ne&s;s as a mighty &s;tream;</HI><NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Amos 3. 24.</NOTE>&mdash;the ble&s;&s;ings which flow down from the throne, under &s;uch an admini&s;tration of govern|ment, make glad the hearts of the people, who are planted by the&s;e rivers of water, or enjoy the benefit of them.</P>
<P>I HAVE been ready to look upon the Briti&s;h nation, as this happy people&mdash;That we had the be&s;t plan of civil government, of any nation or people under heaven.&mdash;That the King of Kings had &s;miled upon us in a peculiar manner, in thus di&s;tingui&s;hing of

us. The over-ruling gracious providence of God is to be acknowledged by a people when this is the ca&s;e. <HI>When he by whom Kings reign, and Princes decree ju&s;tice,</HI> &s;etteth up Kings who are publick ble&s;&s;ings in their exalted &s;tations.</P>
<P>THE names and memories of &s;ome of tho&s;e Worthies, whom the great Ruler of the world, in his kind providence placed on the Briti&s;h Throne, will be dear and pre|cious to this people, &s;o long as we have any ju&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"> apprehen&s;ions of the advantages we enjoyed under their happy admini&s;tration.</P>
<P>KING William <HI>the third,</HI> of glorious me|mory, is regarded by us as the happy in|&s;trument in the hand of God, of delivering the nation from <HI>Popery</HI> and <HI>Tyranny</HI>&mdash;In his au&s;picious reign our Charter was granted, which contains our rights and privileges&mdash;which have been dearly bought by us&mdash;hone&s;tly paid for&mdash;which we have an un|doubted claim to, and I hope in God &s;hall never be deprived of them.</P>
<P>KING George <HI>the fir&s;t</HI>&mdash;and <HI>the &s;econd,</HI> are Princes, who are &s;poken of with high e&s;teem and honor. The ble&s;&s;ings which flow'd from the throne, while they &s;at upon it, were as rivers of water, reviving and re|fre&s;hing&mdash;
<PB N="17" REF="012502_0016_0F8A8FE9E43BFC58">
Their admini&s;tration was like ri|vers in the de&s;art, or &s;treams in the wilder|ne&s;s&mdash;We rejoiced as a happy people under their mild and gentle reigns.</P>
<P>HIS pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty a&s;cended the throne of his royal ance&s;tors, amid&s;t the joyful ac|clamations of his &s;ubjects&mdash;His way to the throne, (if I may be allowed the expre&s;&s;ion) &s;eem'd to be <HI>pav'd with hearts;</HI> &s;o great was the affection of his people for him. His Maje&s;ty gloried in the name of <HI>Briton</HI>&mdash;And the whole nation gloried, in having a Prince born and educated among them, who was to wear the Crown, and &s;way the Scep|tre. Scarce ever a Prince a&s;cended the Bri|ti&s;h throne with equal advantages to do good, and to render his people happy under his admini&s;tration.</P>
<P>How could we wi&s;h that bright day had continued clear and &s;erene!</P>
<P>BUT the &s;cene is changed&mdash;Grievances are complain'd of&mdash;In Great Britain&mdash;In Ireland&mdash;In America&mdash;In this Provinces&mdash;The day is become gloomy and dark, and the waters are troubled.</P>
<P>THIS brings me in the</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="012502_0017_0F8A8FEA9CF901E8">
FOURTH place, to take notice, that the words intimate&mdash;<HI>That even good civil go|vernment may be altered, the Rivers of water may be turned into other channels, or may be|come bitter; or the admini&s;tration of govern|ment may become injurious and oppre&s;&s;ive to the &s;ubject.</HI></P>
<P>'TIS true, the Rivers of water may be &s;hifted into other channels, and the water remain the &s;ame. Government may be ad|mini&s;tered in &s;ome different form, and yet an&s;wer all the happy purpo&s;es intended by it.&mdash;The waters may be like a rapid river, which cannot be pa&s;&s;ed with &s;afety; or, like a river which overflows it's banks, and threat|ens danger to all who are within reach of it&mdash;(and it is alarming when this is the ca&s;e) Yet, the river may become &s;till and quiet; the waters may &s;ub&s;ide, and get and keep within their proper limits&mdash;Or the wa|ters may be troubled by tho&s;e who live near them, and enjoy the benefit of them, which may yet become calm and &s;erene.</P>
<P>AND it is as true, in this &s;tate of things, that admini&s;tration may change&mdash;A King may be <HI>mi&s;led</HI> by evil coun&s;ellors&mdash;He may be <HI>corrupted</HI> by bad mini&s;ters, and give into tho&s;e mea&s;ures which are <HI>injurious</HI> to the &s;ubject.&mdash;The liberty of the &s;ubject may be

thought too great&mdash;De&s;potic principles may look fair&mdash;and a King under a limited mo|narchy may de&s;ire to become independent and ab&s;olute.</P>
<P>KING James <HI>the &s;econd</HI>&mdash;when Duke <HI>of York,</HI> was heard to &s;ay&mdash;that he had rather reign one month as the King of France did, than his whole life, as his brother Charles the &s;econd did&mdash;Unhappy Prince!&mdash;When he came to the throne&mdash;notwith&s;tanding his coronation oaths, he acted upon his Popi&s;h de&s;potic principles, till he became obnoxious to the Engli&s;h nation, <HI>who oppos'd his mea|&s;ures,</HI> which brought on the happy Revolu|tion, when the Prince of Orange was advan|ced to the Briti&s;h throne.</P>
<P>ADMINISTRATION may be <HI>altered</HI> by &s;ubordinate Rulers, by bad mini&s;ters, who are intru&s;ted by the King to conduct the affairs of government.

<P>THE Complaints heard among us; <HI>are;</HI> not <HI>only,</HI> that the Rivers are <HI>&s;hifted</HI> into other Channels, <HI>but</HI> that the waters are be|come <HI>bitter,&mdash;yea</HI>&mdash;that the waters are be|come <HI>bloody</HI>&mdash;Or tho&s;e mea&s;ures have taken
