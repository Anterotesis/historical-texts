<P>THAT <HI>Man is formed for Society,</HI> is evident from the Con&s;titution of his Nature, and the nece&s;&s;ary Connections of human Life.&mdash;What a &s;urprizing ELO|QUENCE has the GOD OF NATURE given to the <HI>Eyes,</HI> the <HI>Countenance,</HI> the <HI>Voice,</HI> the <HI>Air,</HI> and <HI>Ge&s;ture</HI> of Men! How <HI>expre&s;&s;ive</HI> of inward Sentiment and Feeling! And how wi&s;ely calculated to rai&s;e <HI>corre&s;ponding</HI> Senti|ments and Feelings in the Brea&s;ts of <HI>others!</HI> And is it not con&s;picuous that <HI>all the Pa&s;&s;ions</HI> have an Aptitude to communicate <HI>&s;trong</HI> Emotions to, and to rai&s;e <HI>&s;imilar</HI> Pa&s;&s;ions in one another? How readily (for In&s;tance) do the Pa&s;&s;ions of <HI>Fear</HI> and <HI>Hope, Love</HI> and <HI>Hatred, Joy</HI> and <HI>Sorrow,</HI> vibrate from one Bo&s;om to another; and awaken the very &s;ame Kind of Pa&s;&s;ions in <HI>many</HI> which were felt at fir&s;t but in <HI>one!</HI>&mdash;Moreover, we ob|&s;erve among&s;t Men a <HI>Variety</HI> of GENIUS&mdash;Some are framed with peculiar Talents for <HI>forming</HI> Plans, <HI>making</HI> Laws, <HI>inventing</HI> Arts, <HI>taking the Lead</HI> in Science and Government; and con&s;equently to <HI>refine</HI> the Minds, and <HI>poli&s;h</HI> the Manners; and <HI>by that Means</HI> to civilize and felicitate human Life. Others, not &s;o ready to contrive and plan Mea&s;ures, may be more prompt to <HI>execute</HI>&mdash;and tho' not &s;o eminent for Wi&s;dom, may be as much di&s;tingui&s;hed by their Integrity, Love of Freedom, ju&s;t Regard to Government and the Laws, and Benevolence of Heart.&mdash;Now, <HI>all this</HI> was mo&s;t certainly intended by the gracious AUTHOR of our Being, to promote the <HI>common Safety</HI> and <HI>common Good</HI> of the human Kind.

</LIST>
<P>Fir&s;t. The DUTIES &s;uited to our Station as Members of SOCIETY <HI>in general.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e Duties are a <HI>religious Regard</HI> to GOD, a <HI>hearty Love</HI> to our COUNTRY, a <HI>ju&s;t Regard</HI> to the LAWS; and a <HI>Promptitude</HI> to <HI>pre&s;erve</HI> and <HI>defend</HI> the CONSTITUTION.</P>
<P>A <HI>religious Regard</HI> to GOD, is the Ba&s;is of <HI>all Order</HI> in civil Government, and the only <HI>&s;ecure Band</HI> of civil Society. Where the DEITY is not re|garded, there is <HI>no Con&s;cience,</HI> and con&s;equently <HI>no ju&s;t Mea&s;ure</HI> of Good and Evil. All <HI>good</HI> Laws are founded in REASON&mdash;GOD is the <HI>&s;upreme</HI> REASON&mdash;If then there is no Regard to HIM, the Foundation is de|moli&s;hed, and the Super&s;tructure mu&s;t tumble down; con&s;equently <HI>remor&s;ele&s;s</HI> Trea&s;on, Rebellion, Inju&s;tice, Fraud, and Rapine would di&s;turb the public Tran|quillity, whenever <HI>private</HI> Pa&s;&s;ion or <HI>private</HI> Intere&s;t might plea&s;e to throw off Re&s;traint.</P>
<P>In a Country of Athei&s;ts, or of Men de&s;titute of <HI>religious</HI> Principles, what Force could there be in OATHS for the <HI>Deci&s;ion of Controver&s;ies?</HI> What Sincerity in an Appeal to GOD? And <HI>without</HI> Sincerity an OATH
<PB N="5" REF="011460_0004_0F832EAFDF2E0A58">
becomes, in&s;tead of a Means to <HI>promote</HI> Ju&s;tice, and to <HI>e&s;tabli&s;h</HI> Right, a Cloak for Villainy, an Engine of Mi&s;chief! Now it is ju&s;tly <HI>implied</HI> in the Form of an OATH e&s;tabli&s;hed by our Laws, that GOD is <HI>not only</HI> to be religiou&s;ly regarded, but al&s;o that that Regard &s;hould be <HI>manife&s;ted</HI> by a becoming Re&s;pect to the GOSPEL of our SAVIOUR. CHRISTIANITY is <HI>thereby</HI> recommended to Us as the <HI>only</HI> Sy&s;tem of Re|ligion that can make Us <HI>good</HI> Men and <HI>good</HI> Members of SOCIETY&mdash;And that with the highe&s;t Rea&s;on&mdash;be|cau&s;e it is the GENIUS of the GOSPEL, to <HI>recover</HI> Us from the Dominion of Sin; to <HI>rectify</HI> the Di&s;orders of our Minds; to <HI>correct</HI> and even to <HI>eradicate</HI> our Vices; and to <HI>lead</HI> us on through all the Stages of Virtue, and every Cla&s;s of Duties, to the highe&s;t Perfection. It is therefore <HI>e&s;&s;ential</HI> to our being <HI>good</HI> Members of SOCIETY, that We <HI>cultivate</HI> in Our&s;elves, and <HI>promote</HI> in Others, <HI>&s;uch</HI> a religious Regard to the DEITY.</P>
<P>A <HI>hearty</HI> LOVE OF OUR COUNTRY is another Duty incumbent upon Us as Members of SOCIETY. This is a Duty of a very <HI>exten&s;ive</HI> Nature; and includes in it all tho&s;e Duties which We <HI>owe</HI> to our Parents, our Children, Brothers, Friends, Neighbours, and Coun|trymen in general&mdash;Without an <HI>undi&s;&s;embled</HI> and <HI>active</HI> Benevolence to whom, the human Brea&s;t mu&s;t be as a dark hideous Dungeon&mdash;a Habitation of the vile&s;t Vermin!</P>
<P>This LOVE OF OUR COUNTRY, is not therefore a mere partial Regard to <HI>any particular Soil or Province,</HI> where We fir&s;t drew our Breath (tho' that <HI>natural</HI> Tie, in Conjunction with <HI>moral</HI> Ones may, in certain Situa|tions, &s;trengthen our Attachment) &mdash;but it implies a <HI>&s;trong</HI> Affection to the COMMUNITY in which Wedwell, as governed by <HI>ju&s;t</HI> and <HI>equitable</HI> Laws, flowing from a wi&s;e and happy CONSTITUTION; and <HI>cemented</HI> in all it's Parts by the great Principle of a COMMON INTEREST.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="011460_0005_0F832EB2A2B66210"><HI>Such</HI> a CONSTITUTION of GOVERNMENT We partake of, who are Members of the ROYAL-COMMONWEALTH of BRITAIN&mdash;A CONSTITUTION which (when well pre|&s;erved) gives Security again&s;t the <HI>Tyranny</HI> of Princes, and again&s;t the <HI>Licentiou&s;ne&s;s</HI> of the People&mdash;A Con|&s;titution which admits not of Inju&s;tice to <HI>any,</HI> and gives Freedom and Safety to <HI>all</HI>&mdash;A CONSTITUTION under which our Lives, our Liberty, our Property, can never be touch'd, but by the JUDGMENT OF OUR PEERS, and by the LAWS of <HI>our own enacting.</HI> What <HI>hone&s;t</HI> Bo&s;om then does not glow with Love to the COMMUNITY, being founded in Principles &s;o ju&s;t and equitable? And what worthy Heart does not burn with Indignation again&s;t it's Enemies?&mdash;In this Ca&s;e, <HI>In|difference mu&s;t be highly criminal.</HI></P>
<P>It is our Duty <HI>al&s;o</HI> to pay a <HI>due</HI> REGARD TO THE LAWS. By the Laws We are not to under&s;tand <HI>every</HI> Law that <HI>may po&s;&s;ibly</HI> be enacted, (for it is <HI>po&s;&s;ible</HI> that under <HI>Colour of Law,</HI> We <HI>may</HI> one Day be called upon to &s;wear Allegiance to <HI>&s;ome</HI> PRETENDER) but by the Laws, We mean every Law that is <HI>regularly</HI> pa&s;&s;ed in <HI>Con&s;i&s;tence</HI> with the <HI>fundamental</HI> Laws of the Realm&mdash; e&s;pecially the GRAND CHARTER, the BILL OF RIGHTS, the ACT OF SETTLEMENT, and the <HI>ancient</HI> CUSTOMS &mdash;To <HI>&s;uch</HI> Laws, and their <HI>due</HI> Execution, We are in|debted for our <HI>common</HI> Safety and <HI>common</HI> Happine&s;s. It is <HI>therefore</HI> the Duty of each Individual to obey the Laws, and to &s;ubmit to the <HI>civil</HI> MAGISTRATES, as the Guardians and Executors of them. It is from THEM that We expect Protection, as the Con&s;ervators of the public Peace, and as the Guardians of our Freedom; and therefore We <HI>owe</HI> THEM the highe&s;t Defference in their &s;everal Departments, and the be&s;t Support in the Execution of their re&s;pective Offices. <HI>Without this</HI> Regard to the <HI>con&s;titutional</HI> Laws, the Community can|not long exi&s;t; but mu&s;t quickly &s;ink into a lawle&s;s Rabble; Anarchy and Confu&s;ion would over-run our

Country, while Ju&s;tice, Mercy, Honour, Truth and Bli&s;s, would for&s;ake our Dwellings!</P>
<P><HI>Another Duty,</HI> incumbent on Us all, as Members of Society in general, is a PROMPTITUDE to <HI>pre&s;erve</HI> and <HI>defend</HI> the <HI>happy</HI> CONSTITUTION of our Country&mdash;A Con&s;titution perhaps the be&s;t, becau&s;e the mo&s;t equi|table, and the lea&s;t liable to abu&s;e, of any under the Sun&mdash;<HI>wi&s;ely</HI> balanced, and <HI>exactly</HI> calculated to an&s;wer all the de&s;irable Ends of Government&mdash;SUCH A SYSTEM ought to be watched with the greate&s;t Circum&s;pection &mdash;for tho' it is an Object of Veneration among&s;t the wi&s;e and good; yet it is an Object of Di&s;like among&s;t the Sons of Avarice and Debauchery, who can never thrive but amid&s;t their Country's Di&s;tre&s;&s;es. And if at any Time Corruption or Violence &s;hould attempt an Encroachment upon it, We ought to re&s;i&s;t the Attack, &s;o as to defeat, if po&s;&s;ible, the <HI>traiterous</HI> In|tention&mdash;and <HI>this</HI> at the Ri&s;que of all that is dear to Us under the Heavens.&mdash;The <HI>unmanly,</HI> the <HI>iniquitous,</HI> Doctrine of <HI>pa&s;&s;ive Obedience</HI> and <HI>Non-Re&s;i&s;tance,</HI> is I hope for ever exploded, and bani&s;hed the&s;e Realms&mdash; &s;o that, however it <HI>may</HI> lurk in the dark Bo&s;oms of Malevolence, Selfi&s;hne&s;s, and Di&s;loyalty, it will ever be a&s;hamed to appear again in any Part of the Briti&s;h Dominion&mdash;For it is very certain that the PEOPLE are the <HI>natural,</HI> the <HI>original,</HI> FOUNTAIN of HONOUR, AU|THORITY, and LAWS. When therefore their <HI>funda|mental</HI> LAWS are <HI>corrupted</HI>; when their <HI>delegated</HI> AU|THORITY is <HI>pro&s;tituted</HI> to pernicious Purpo&s;es; when THEY &s;ee the CONSTITUTION of their Country <HI>over-turning</HI>;&mdash;are THEY to &s;tand as <HI>pa&s;&s;ive</HI> Spectators of the Ruin?&mdash;Rather it is their Duty to &s;tand forth as the AVENGERS of Inju&s;tice, the RESTORERS of public Virtue; and to bring Tyranny <HI>or</HI> Trea&s;on to <HI>condign</HI> Puni&s;hment.&mdash;This is a Doctrine (not of Licentiou&s;|ne&s;s, but) of the <HI>highe&s;t</HI> Loyalty, and the <HI>pure&s;t</HI> Regard to the public Good. For this <HI>Doctrine</HI> not admitted,

this <HI>Duty</HI> not practi&s;ed upon an Emergency, what Safety has our SOVEREIGN in his Throne? What Secu|rity the PEOPLE in their Rights?&mdash;An ignorant, or a debauched Mind, can't perhaps con&s;ider this Doctrine, without the Idea of a <HI>lawle&s;s</HI> Rabble in Arms again&s;t <HI>lawful</HI> Government&mdash;but I am per&s;uaded that <HI>&s;uch</HI> an Idea is more abhorrent to the <HI>&s;ober</HI> Advocates for this Principle, than to <HI>tho&s;e</HI> who generally deba&s;e it by &s;o <HI>gro&s;s</HI> a Conception.&mdash;It is a Principle on which was founded the GLORIOUS REVOLUTION; and to which the ILLUS|TRIOUS HOUSE OF HANOVER is indebted for its Right to the Briti&s;h Crown&mdash;<HI>which may GOD pre&s;erve to the late&s;t Ages.</HI></P>
<P>Having pointed out the Duties incumbent upon Us all, as Members of Society in general; I am now to <HI>recommend</HI> &s;ome Mea&s;ures to THIS SOCIETY in parti|cular.</P>
<P>I am &s;en&s;ible that the PLANTER's SOCIETY was <HI>origi|nally</HI> formed, tho' on Principles of Public Virtue, yet, on a <HI>limited</HI> Plan&mdash;But on particular Occa&s;ions the&s;e Prin|ciples will certainly excite You to pur&s;ue Mea&s;ures of more <HI>exten&s;ive</HI> Utility; and where your Country calls, for <HI>either</HI> Coun&s;el or Action, You are ever prompt to <HI>obey</HI> the Call with Alacrity and Cheerfulne&s;s, to the ut|mo&s;t of your Ability.&mdash;I need not inform You, GEN|TLEMEN, that at <HI>this very Time,</HI> Your Country calls for the Exertion of <HI>all</HI> your Talents&mdash;Not only is your OWN PROVINCE, but all NORTH-AMERICA, and even|tually the WHOLE BRITISH EMPIRE, in Hazard of being plunged into Di&s;grace and Ruin, by Mea&s;ures <HI>&s;ubver|&s;ive</HI> of Freedom&mdash;You know there have been two Que&s;tions <HI>lately</HI> agitated in the Briti&s;h Parliament, and re&s;olved again&s;t the very <HI>fir&s;t</HI> Principles of the Con|&s;titution! The fir&s;t is, <Q><HI>Whether</HI> You are Freeholders and Men of Property, <HI>or only</HI> Tenants at Will, and the Money in your Pur&s;e at <HI>your Own,</HI> or at the Command of <HI>Others?</HI></Q> Secondly&mdash;<Q>Whether you
<PB N="9" REF="011460_0008_0F832EB62112C048">
&s;hall be &s;ubject to the Laws of the Land, and the Judgment of your Peers, in Matters of Debate, <HI>or</HI> to a Court of Admiralty, and ab&s;olute Dependants on the Crown?</Q>&mdash;It has been alledged, that the&s;e Points are &s;ettled by the Parliament of Great-Britain, and that their Determinations <HI>&s;hould</HI> and <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be deci&s;ive. The BRITISH PARLIAMENT is an <HI>augu&s;t</HI> Body, and We &s;hould ever &s;peak of it's Wi&s;dom and Authority with the Reverence it <HI>de&s;erves.</HI> But is the Briti&s;h Parlia|ment infallible? Should it, or <HI>can it legally,</HI> contradict it&s;elf? If LORD CHIEF-JUSTICE COKE was alive, HE would declare that &s;uch Determinations, as above hinted at, are <HI>void in them&s;elves:</HI> And that for this plain Rea&s;on, becau&s;e they are repugnant to the GREAT CHARTER of ENGLAND, to the BILL OF RIGHTS, and to <HI>many other</HI> ACTS OF PARLIAMENT, which &s;tand <HI>unrepealed</HI>&mdash;To the&s;e <HI>capital</HI> Laws, Briti&s;h Subjects may &s;afely appeal: The&s;e Laws are our Judges; by their expre&s;s Determination We abide. If <HI>they</HI> &s;hould declare that the Law of the Land is as a <HI>No&s;e of Wax,</HI> and Trials by our Peers a <HI>dubious</HI> or <HI>precarious Right,</HI> then the Point would be &s;ettled, till We could make our <HI>imaginary</HI> Freedom <HI>real.</HI> But here, my COUNTRYMEN! We &s;tand upon a &s;table Bottom&mdash;here's a Ba&s;is that can never be <HI>re|moved,</HI> but by the total Ruin of the whole Empire&mdash; <HI>Which may Heaven mercifully pre&s;erve.</HI> But after all&mdash; <Q>Is it not Rebellion to oppo&s;e an Act of Parliament? Is it not Trea&s;on to fly in the Face of Government?</Q> To the&s;e Que&s;tions it may be &s;afe&s;t to let the <HI>learned</HI> reply&mdash;Lord CAMBDEN declared <HI>&s;uch</HI> Acts of Parlia|ment to be contrary to the RIGHTS of AMERICANS &mdash; And <HI>&s;uch</HI> Oppo&s;ition, MR. PITT told the Hou&s;e of Commons HE rejoiced in. <HI>However,</HI> the Oppo&s;ition, <HI>at pre&s;ent,</HI> is rather IN, than AGAINST, Acts of Parlia|ment&mdash;One Act being <HI>contradictory</HI> to another. <HI>If any</HI> Oppo&s;ition is <HI>now</HI> made by AMERICANS&mdash;it is <HI>argumen|tative</HI>
<PB N="10" REF="011460_0009_0F832EB6AA6272D8">
only&mdash;not an Oppo&s;ition by a Breach of the Peace; but by &s;ober Remon&s;trance, and humble Pe|tition, <HI>founded</HI> upon the Laws, and our unalienable, and accu&s;tomed Rights.&mdash;But the&s;e Remon&s;trances are not heard&mdash;the&s;e Petitions are not an&s;wered: We are &s;till <HI>plundered</HI> of our Property, and <HI>deprived</HI> of our Birth-rights. Then I earne&s;tly recommend it to You, Gentlemen, as a Society of Freemen, a Band of Brothers, to give Us the Example in Signing the AGREEMENT. In that there is no Trea&s;on; no Di&s;|loyalty; nor any Thing that &s;avours of Rebellion, <HI>even by the &s;evere&s;t Implication of Law</HI>&mdash;Nothing in &s;hort, but Re&s;olutions to <HI>avoid</HI> Extravagance, to <HI>pro|mote</HI> Oeconomy, and to <HI>encourage</HI> Indu&s;try. This is a Mea&s;ure, that will an&s;wer both <HI>private</HI> and <HI>public</HI> good Purpo&s;es. <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> it will enable you to pay your Debts. <HI>Secondly,</HI> it will operate &s;o as to bring our MOTHER-COUNTRY to Right-Rea&s;on, and teach Her the Nece&s;&s;ity of a maternal Regard to her virtuous Sons&mdash;which will be no Injury to HER, but of la&s;t|ing Benefit to BOTH.&mdash;By this &s;ober, quiet, &s;hort, and ea&s;y Mea&s;ure, We &s;hall <HI>convince</HI> the World, that We are <HI>hone&s;t</HI> Men, and <HI>good</HI> Subjects, paying an <HI>equal</HI> Regard to the Peace, and to the Welfare of our Country&mdash;And, We may be confident, that our SO|VEREIGN (if rightly informed) will <HI>applaud</HI> our Virtue, while HE <HI>admires</HI> the Dignity of our Behaviour; and will not in future li&s;ten to the Calumnies of tho&s;e Men who <HI>attempt to &s;acrifice</HI> the Royal Repo&s;e, the Con&s;titution of their Country, and the Freedom of Millions, to their unbounded Avarice and Ambition. &mdash;I hope <HI>therefore,</HI> that no HONEST MAN in this A&s;&s;em|bly, and I am per&s;uaded, that no Member of the PLANTER's SOCIETY, will refu&s;e to &s;ign his Name to the AGREEMENT.</P>
<P>GENTLEMEN! You will permit me farther to ob|&s;erve, that as your Society was at fir&s;t formed upon a

<P>As to the <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> viz. The ADMINISTRATION OF JUS|TICE, the Law provides indeed for the <HI>ea&s;y Recovery of &s;mall</HI> Debts and Damages.

Whether &s;o <HI>heavy</HI> a Charge is <HI>ju&s;t</HI> or <HI>unju&s;t,</HI> GENTLE|MEN, You know.&mdash;I am &s;ure, that no <HI>worthy</HI> Ma|gi&s;trate, can &s;uppo&s;e it aimed at Him; and as to <HI>Others,</HI> I leave them to feel that Remor&s;e which &s;ooner or later <HI>will fa&s;ten</HI> as a Vulture on their Bo&s;oms. &mdash;But if the Charge is <HI>ju&s;t,</HI> &s;hould not Something be done to <HI>remedy</HI> this Evil? I would &s;ubmit it to the Con&s;ideration of THIS SOCIETY, if it would not be proper to <HI>&s;earch out</HI> Men of this Character&mdash;to <HI>lodge Complaints</HI> again&s;t them, and to <HI>u&s;e Endeavours to pro|cure</HI> their being &s;truck out of the Commi&s;&s;ion.
