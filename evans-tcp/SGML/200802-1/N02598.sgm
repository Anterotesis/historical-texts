<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><HI>IT will &s;eem &s;trange to &s;ome to meet with a Sermon of mine upon this occa&s;ion. I never could &s;ee rea&s;on to think the Sin of the day was a national one, that &s;hould oblige us to fa&s;t yearly &s;o long a time after it. And the chief pur|po&s;es to which 'tis generally apply'd, were never any encouragement to me to fa&s;t with them, or pay any religious regard to the day.</HI></P>

<HI>BUT it happen'd this year to fall on the day of our weekly Lecture, when it was my turn to preach. I thought therefore it would not be improper to &s;ay &s;omewhat in our own vindication, at a time when we were every where in&s;ulted, and abus'd. The Sermon was compos'd and preach'd without the lea&s;t intention of printing it; but being earne&s;tly de&s;ir'd by many of the hearers to let it appear in the world, I have given way to their impor|tunity.</HI></P>

<Q><HI>As the bird by wandering, as the Swallow by flying; &s;o the Cur&s;e cau&s;ele&s;s &s;hall not come.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>'TIS the cu&s;tom of his pretended Ho|line&s;s, the Man of Sin, once a year to cur&s;e us, among the re&s;t of tho&s;e, whom he is pleas'd to count He|retics, in the mo&s;t &s;olemn manner, by Bell, Book, and Candle. I wi&s;h his example was follow'd by none but tho&s;e of his own Church. But, alas! 'tis &s;ad to ob&s;erve, how addicted furious and angry men are to love cur&s;ing, rather than ble&s;&s;ing; and with what plea&s;ure &s;ome men thunder out their &s;evere Cen&s;ures, and bitter imprecations, again&s;t their innocent neighbours. And did they <HI>&s;catter their fire brands, arrows and death,</HI> only when they were <HI>in &s;port,</HI> and over their prophane cups, and in their merry meetings, their impiety would be far le&s;s than 'tis, when they attempt to &s;anctify their malice, by bringing it into their Wor&s;hip, and venting it in the name of GOD him&s;elf. It has been for a long time the cu&s;tom of many to <HI>fa&s;t</HI> this day in the year <HI>for &s;trife and
<PB N="6" REF="003082_0005_0FEFB83112865710">
debate, and to &s;mite with the fi&s;t of wickedne&s;s.</HI> And we, all of us, are generally repre&s;ented as the vile&s;t mi&s;creants, and the abomination of GOD, with a de&s;ign to inflame again&s;t us the hatred and vengeance of men. And in this ca&s;e, when the foundations of ju&s;tice and charity are over-turn'd, What &s;hall the righteous do? Or, where &s;hall they &s;eek for refuge and comfort, but in the providence of the great GOD, who keeps the ordering all events in his own hand; and who will not intru&s;t men with an arbitrary di&s;tribution of all the Cur&s;es, they would be as glad to inflict, as they are to denounce? <HI>Vengeance be|longs to him, and be will recompence,</HI> Heb. 10. 30. And <HI>there is no evil in the city, and the Lord hath not done it,</HI> Amos 3. 6. Neither the ra&s;h judgments, nor the fal&s;e repre&s;entations, nor the cruel Imprecations and threatnings of angry men &s;hall be able to hurt us, if we are &s;ecure of GOD's favour. A con&s;cience void of offence will make us ea&s;y in our ex|pectation of a Ble&s;&s;ing, when we are &s;tunn'd with the loude&s;t noi&s;e of Cur&s;ing. For, as <HI>Solomon</HI> a&s;&s;erts in the Text, <HI>The Cur&s;e cau&s;ele&s;s &s;hall not come.</HI> 'Tis upon this clau&s;e of the <HI>Ver&s;e</HI> I intend to in&s;i&s;t, for our encouragement and comfort on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion. But the connexion of it with the former part of the <HI>Ver&s;e</HI> being ob&s;cure, and the latter clau&s;e hav|ing &s;ome ambiguity in it; I think it will be nece&s;&s;ary to give &s;ome account, in the fir&s;t place, of the general meaning of the words.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="003082_0006_0FEFB858A8104960">
IN the <HI>Hebrew</HI> there is often a difference between the Text and the Margin, the <HI>Che|<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="4 letters"></HI> and the <HI>Keri:</HI> and Tran&s;lators take the liberty of following &s;ometimes the one, and &s;ometimes the other: and 'tis often hard to judge which is be&s;t, the <HI>Jews</HI> pretending both to be owing to the in&s;pir'd Writers. Thus it is in the la&s;t clau&s;e of the Text, which, according to one reading of the Original, may be ren|der'd thus: <HI>So is the Cur&s;e cau&s;ele&s;s, it &s;hall not come.</HI> And according to the other reading, thus: <HI>So is the Cur&s;e cau&s;ele&s;s, it &s;hall come upon him;</HI> that is, upon the per&s;on, who without cau&s;e de|nounces it. Now the meaning of the former clau&s;e of the <HI>Ver&s;e</HI> will be different according as we fix upon the one, or t'other reading of the latter. If we read it: <HI>As the bird by wan|dering, as the Swallow by flying; &s;o is the Cur&s;e cau&s;ele&s;s, it &s;hall not come:</HI> the &s;en&s;e will be this: That the Cur&s;e cau&s;ele&s;s is a wild and uncer|tain thing, as much at random, as the flying of a bird; that it as ea&s;ily flies over our heads without doing us any hurt, as a bird does; or, that it is as ea&s;ily avoided by us, as a &s;nare is by a bird that is upon the wing. But if we take the other reading of the words: <HI>As the bird by wandering, as the Swallow by flying, &s;o is the Cur&s;e cau&s;ele&s;s, it &s;hall come upon him:</HI> the meaning will be: That as a bird by wander|ing expo&s;es it&s;elf to danger, &s;o does a man by cau&s;ele&s;s cur&s;ing of his neighbour, the mi&s;|chief falls upon him&s;elf. And we may ob&s;erve, the wi&s;e man repre&s;ents el&s;ewhere the ne&s;t, as
<PB N="8" REF="003082_0007_0FEFB834B34ED788">
a place of &s;afety for a bird; and &s;peaks of it as expos'd to danger, by leaving <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> wander|ing from its ne&s;t: <HI>As a bird that wan<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">eth from her ne&s;t; &s;o is a man that wandereth from his place</HI> Prov. 26. 8. Either of the&s;e &s;en&s;es is mo&s;t ju&s;t and true, and we need not to be &s;olicitous which to prefer. I confe&s;s the latter &s;eems to me more agreeable to <HI>Solomon</HI>'s u&s;e of the com|pari&s;on here mention'd. But then that &s;en&s;e implies the other. For if the cur&s;e falls upon him, who denounces it; then it does not upon him, again&s;t whom 'tis denounc'd.</P>
<P>IN &s;peaking therefore to the Text, I &s;hall,</P>
<P>I. INQUIRE, When a Cur&s;e may be &s;aid to be cau&s;ele&s;s?</P>
<P>II. I SHALL &s;hew you, That the Cur&s;e, with which we are ordinarily loaded on this day, is cau&s;ele&s;s.</P>
<P>III. I SHALL endeavour to &s;et before you the comfort, which the Text holds forth to you; that this cau&s;ele&s;s Cur&s;e &s;hall be mi&s;chievous, not to them who are cur&s;ed, but to the Cur&s;ers them&s;elves.</P>
<P>I. I SHALL inquire, When a Cur&s;e may be &s;aid to be cau&s;ele&s;s? Now there are four ca&s;es, wherein a cur&s;e may be cau&s;ele&s;s.</P>
<P N="1">I. WHEN the pretended ground, or rea&s;on of the Cur&s;e, is &s;omething really good and ju&s;t;
<PB N="9" REF="003082_0008_0FEFB85D45F27218">
or, however harmle&s;s and innocent, and &s;o there is no occa&s;ion for any cur&s;ing at all. The Cur&s;e cau&s;ele&s;s is the Cur&s;e, which is un|de&s;erv'd; and certainly nothing can be more unde&s;erv'd than a Cur&s;e, when a man's actions are &s;uch as merit commendation and prai&s;e.</P>
<P N="2">2. THE Cur&s;e is cau&s;ele&s;s, when tho' the oc|ca&s;ion of it is evil, yet the evil is too incon|&s;iderable to de&s;erve &s;uch a Cur&s;e, as is de|nounc'd upon the account of it. There are degrees of evil, as well as good; and 'tis not a man's being &s;ure there is evil in any action, that will ju&s;tify him in pa&s;&s;ing the mo&s;t &s;evere and rigorous &s;entence upon him who is guilty of it. A Father, a Ma&s;ter, or a Magi&s;trate would be very unju&s;t, if he &s;hould puni&s;h every offence with equal &s;everity. A proportion is always to be ob&s;erv'd, and men are to be dealt with &s;evere|ly or mildly, according to the nature of the crime they have committed. And &s;o far as the doom, or Cur&s;e men pronounce, exceeds the de&s;ert of the offence, &s;o far is it without doubt cau&s;ele&s;s. Be&s;ides, the law of charity &s;hould teach us to make all the allowances we can, for tho&s;e circum&s;tances, which may alleviate per|&s;ons guilt. Our common infirmities may, one would think, incline us to follow this rule. We often need our&s;elves tho&s;e charitable con&s;truc|tions, which our neighbours expect we &s;hould put upon their actions. And it would be hard and cau&s;ele&s;s to cur&s;e a per&s;on, as doing that wilfully and maliciou&s;ly, which he did thro' mi&s;take or inadvertence. This indeed can't be al|ledg'd
<PB N="10" REF="003082_0009_0FEFB8366520AB50">
in ca&s;es plainly and gro&s;&s;ly evil, where every man's con&s;cience mu&s;t needs inform him: but without all que&s;tion, great regard &s;hould be had to &s;uch circum&s;tances in all intricate and di&s;putable matters, wherein good men have been found to take both &s;ides of the que&s;tion.</P>
<P N="3">3. THE Cur&s;e is cau&s;ele&s;s, when the per&s;on again&s;t whom 'tis levell'd is innocent, and had no hand in the occa&s;ion of it, however grie|vou&s;ly evil and wicked it was. For in this ca&s;e, tho' the Cur&s;e may be de&s;erv'd; yet 'tis evi|dent, 'tis not by him who is cur&s;ed. And men &s;hould be as careful to acquit the innocent, as they are to condemn the guilty.</P>
<P N="4">4. THEN is the Cur&s;e cau&s;ele&s;s, when the per&s;on who denounces it, is equally guilty with him, whom he cur&s;es, For whatever the crime is, yet he mu&s;t with a very ill grace cur&s;e o|thers for it, who has him&s;elf an equal &s;hare in the guilt. And he that cur&s;es another, for what he does him&s;elf, virtually cur&s;es him&s;elf. <HI>Therefore thou art inexcu&s;able, O man, who&s;oever thou art that judge&s;t: for wherein thou judge&s;t another thou condemne&s;t thy&s;elf; for thou that judge&s;t, do&s;t the &s;ame things.</HI> Rom. 2. 1, 2. And tho' the Cur&s;e may not in this ca&s;e be cau&s;ele&s;s in it &s;elf; yet it manife&s;tly is &s;o in the per&s;on, from whom it proceeds.</P>
<P>I SUPPOSE there can be no difficulty in perceiving the Cur&s;e is cau&s;ele&s;s in the&s;e &s;eve|ral ca&s;es. I proceed therefore to the next part of my Di&s;cour&s;e,</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="003082_0010_0FEFB85FB0EA00D0">
II. TO &s;hew, that the Cur&s;e with which we are ordinarily loaded on this day is cau&s;e|le&s;s; and that our Adver&s;aries have no rea&s;on to abu&s;e, revile, and condemn us at the rate they do, upon this occa&s;ion: And here I need only con&s;ider, how applicable tho&s;e &s;everal things already mention'd, which &s;hew a Cur&s;e to be cau&s;ele&s;s, are to our ca&s;e.</P>
<P N="1">1. A Great part of the matter of our charge, and the rea&s;on why we have &s;uch a heavy doom pa&s;t upon us, is &s;o far from being cri|minal, that it is truly noble, and de&s;erves much prai&s;e and commendation. I &s;peak now only of what was done by the Parliament, and tho&s;e who joyn'd with them again&s;t the King, or rather again&s;t his evil Coun&s;ellors. As to what follow'd, when &s;everal of the Members were &s;ecluded, and a few only were &s;uffer'd to be pre&s;ent, and give their Vote; I &s;hall never reckon that to be the Parliament's Act. But a great load is thrown upon us, for what was the Act of the Parliament, and all the trou|bles of that unhappy time are ordinarily laid at our door: But the troubles were really ow|ing to tho&s;e, who put the King upon invading the rights of his Subjects; and that brave Par|liament is worthy of an honourable and ever|la&s;ting remembrance, who &s;tood up nobly in the defence of them. All the world mu&s;t own, it properly belong'd to the Parliament to take notice of, and redre&s;s &s;uch grievances, as the Nation then groan'd under. They are the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">ence
<PB N="12" REF="003082_0011_0FEFB838D41FE6B8">
and bulwark of our civil Liberties, again&s;t the incroachments of an arbitrary Power. The wi&s;dom of our ance&s;tors had provided, that Parliaments &s;hould have an opportunity of look|ing into, and redre&s;&s;ing the Nation's grievances, by re&s;erving to them the Power of &s;upplying the Prince with money. And when there was no &s;uch Law, as has been &s;ince made, for the frequent meeting of tho&s;e A&s;&s;emblies; there was no other way to &s;ecure to the Nation their Privileges, but by a &s;tiff defence of their right to refu&s;e to part with their money, unle&s;s it was given in a Parliamentary way. 'Twas this began tho&s;e troubles, and all the world mu&s;t ju&s;tify that Parliament, for &s;tanding up in de|fence of the right of the Subjects; and taking the opportunity to redre&s;s the mi&s;chiefs, which were owing to as corrupt and vile a Mini&s;try, as ever had before hara&s;s'd the Nation. And doubtle&s;s, while the Parliament &s;tood up in de|fence of the Subjects Liberties, it was the duty of the Subjects to &s;tand by them and defend them. And to that noble Stand, that was then made in the days of our Forefathers, we are indebted, that we their Po&s;terity are not a ge|neration of Slaves to the Arbitrary Power of our Kings, and the lu&s;ts of &s;uch a vicious, fawning Clergy, as then carry'd all before them.</P>
<P N="2"> 2. SUPPOSING the proceedings of the Par|liament, and the Nation (for I as yet meddle with no more) were in &s;ome re&s;pects evil and unju&s;tifiable; yet were there &s;uch circum&s;tances
<PB N="13" REF="003082_0012_0FEFB8632200FC90">
in their ca&s;e, as mu&s;t be allow'd to go a great way in excu&s;ing them, and &s;hould there|fore lighten the cen&s;ure men pa&s;s upon them. 'Tis indeed very hard for the be&s;t of men to manage a long quarrel, that ri&s;es to a con|&s;iderable height, without de&s;erving &s;ome blame. Tho' we allow, there were &s;ome things ami&s;s in the conduct of tho&s;e, who &s;tood up for the Liberties of the People; yet every one mu&s;t &s;ee, their end and de&s;ign was very good, and that the methods they took were generally &s;o too. And this will go a great way in excu&s;|ing, even when it will not wholly ju&s;tify. If their Jealou&s;ies and &s;u&s;picions ran too high, and if the terms they &s;tood upon &s;eem to have been &s;ometimes a little extravagent, let their circum&s;tances be con&s;ider'd. They had &s;een what advances had been made to &s;et up Ty|ranny, both in Church and State; they had the Ma&s;&s;acre of 200,000 of their Brethren in <HI>Ireland</HI> before their eyes, and the threatnings of the like u&s;age were loud in their ears. And in &s;uch a ca&s;e, who can blame them, if they in&s;i&s;ted upon an extraordinary &s;ecurity? If their &s;u&s;picions were beyond the true de&s;igns of tho&s;e they had to deal with, they may thank them&s;elves who gave them too much rea&s;on to entertain them. Our Senators could not have been faithful in the tru&s;t their Coun|try had lodg'd in them, if they had not done their utmo&s;t to &s;ecure the &s;afety of the Nation. And if it was a fault, 'twas certainly a very pardonable one, that they thought it much better to lay a re&s;traint upon the Power of the
<PB N="14" REF="003082_0013_0FEFB83B4AE6E4C0">
Prince, than to hazard the utter ruin and de|&s;truction of the Community. And therefore, as to what was a national act, that is, what was then done by a free Parliament at that time, po&s;terity &s;hould, and I doubt not in a little time will, judge more calmly and impar|tially concerning it; and not load as brave a &s;et of men, as ever the Nation had, with their cen&s;ures, for a conduct, which derives &s;o many advantages and benefits to their Suc|ce&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P N="3">3. 'TIS mo&s;t evident, the Cur&s;e which is u&s;ually on this day denounc'd again&s;t us, is cau&s;ele&s;s; becau&s;e we are perfectly innocent, and had no manner of hand in the pretended occa&s;ion of their cur&s;ing us. Let the tran&s;ac|tion of the day be as black and horrid as they plea&s;e to repre&s;ent it, what is that to us? What rea&s;on have they to rai&s;e &s;uch an out-cry again&s;t us upon that account? 'Tis now &s;ixty|-eight years ago &s;ince the thing was done; and 'tis a que&s;tion whether there be any per|&s;on left in the Nation, who had directly, or indirectly, the lea&s;t hand in the King's death? Is it not then cau&s;ele&s;s, for them to run out with &s;o much intemperance and extravagance in cur&s;ing us, for a matter of which we are wholly innocent, and which was tran&s;acted, if not before we were born, yet at lea&s;t before we were capable of having any hand in it?</P>
<P><HI>Obj.</HI> I. BUT &s;ay they; If you had no hand in it, your fathers had, and the Cur&s;e is due to you for your fathers &s;ins.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="003082_0014_0FEFB864AD4639A8">
<HI>Ans.</HI> THE putting the King to death was the act of a very few; and the families who can in this re&s;pect be concern'd in it cannot be many. The act was far from being national, but was commited by a <HI>Juncto</HI> of men, who op|pre&s;s'd the nation, and in&s;lav'd the Parliament. And tho' they don't care to own it, yet they know very well, that the Leaders of the Peo|ple, the<NOTE PLACE="foot"><HI>See</HI> Vindication of the Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel in and about <HI>London,</HI> 1648.</NOTE> Mini&s;ters at that time, earne&s;tly, and with the hazard of their all in this world, open|ly prote&s;ted again&s;t the fact, to the very face of them who did it. One would think, they who pretend to embalm the memory of that King, &s;hould treat tho&s;e, who appear'd his friends at that time, with &s;omewhat more of decency. If they were not able to &s;ave the King from death, yet they &s;hew'd their good-will to do it; and when they could do no more, thro' the domineering power of a few, they heartily pro|te&s;ted again&s;t it, when we could tell them, who &s;tood by without &s;peaking a word in his be|half.</P>
<P><HI>Obj.</HI> 2. HOWEVER, &s;ay they, tho' you had not a per&s;onal hand in that fact, your principles are the &s;ame with theirs who had, you are all of you for de&s;troying Kings, and will gladly do it upon every opportunity, and therefore we ju&s;tly charge you with the wickedne&s;s, and cur&s;e you for it.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="003082_0015_0FEFB84014517E08">
<HI>Ans.</HI> 'TIS very much, I confe&s;s, we &s;hould have &s;uch had principles as they charge us with, and not know it: and that they &s;hould be bet|ter able to tell us what our principles are, than we can tell our&s;elves. Tho' &s;uch bold a&s;&s;ertions may delude their ea&s;y followers, who receive them with an implicit faith; yet certainly it mu&s;t be very hard for them to convince us, or indeed, any indifferent per&s;ons, that we don't know our own principles. If the law of the land has e&s;tabli&s;h'd them as a Church; yet I &s;uppo&s;e neither that, nor the law of GOD, has e&s;tabli&s;h'd 'em as Inqui&s;itors and &s;earchers of mens hearts. This pretence of the badne&s;s of our principles, with re&s;pect to civil Government, has been artfully play'd again&s;t us. Our Schools have been repre&s;ented as dangerous, and not to be allow'd. And who can doubt they mu&s;t be &s;o, if what they &s;ay be true? For why may not a man as well be &s;uppos'd to teach, as to hold, ba&s;e principles, without knowing any thing of the matter? But if the&s;e Inqui&s;itors will con|de&s;cend to us &s;o far, as to give us leave to know our own principles, allow us to be able to give a more faithful account of them, than they can do for us; we do not doubt to ju&s;tify our principles again&s;t all the &s;en&s;ele&s;s clamours of tho&s;e who would run us down.</P>
<P>WE think it then our duty to live peacea|bly and quietly under that Government, which the providence of GOD, and the laws of the land have &s;et over us: that we are bound to
<PB N="17" REF="003082_0016_0FEFB8674910B590">
be &s;ubject to it, and according to our &s;tations to maintain it, &s;o long as it an&s;wers its true end, without troubling our&s;elves about the par|ticular form of it. If we don't believe the un|alienable indefea&s;ible Right, or the <HI>jus divinum</HI> of Kings, and an arbitrary Government, they may thank them&s;elves for it; &s;ince they never produce any &s;ufficient Charter for it, while they pretend to have one. In &s;hort, we di&s;tingui&s;h between Kings and Tyrants; tho&s;e who make the good of their people, and tho&s;e who make their own plea&s;ure, the rule of their admini|&s;tration. The former we think our&s;elves bound in con&s;cience to obey; and the latter we &s;hould think we were great fools, if we did not to our power with&s;tand and re&s;i&s;t. Such are our principles, that no good King need, or ever did, di&s;tru&s;t us: and we count it not a di&s;ho|nour to us; that bad ones are always jealous of us; and we wi&s;h our Adver&s;aries did not, by endeavouring alway to improve the jealou&s;y of &s;uch, convince the world they are the only ones for their turn. If we don't complement our Princes with the promi&s;e of obedience without re&s;erve; yet we think our&s;elves bound to be &s;ubject to them in all civil things, while they make the Laws of the land their &s;tandard. And as to our con&s;ciences in religi|ous matters, we prote&s;t 'tis, and hope it ever will be our principle, to keep them &s;acred to the direction of a higher and greater Prince, who alone has a right to pre&s;cribe to them.

<P>I. THE Cur&s;e cau&s;ele&s;s &s;hall not come upon the per&s;ons, at whom it is levell'd.

<P>(I.) THAT GOD has not left it in the power of &s;uch per&s;ons to execute their &s;entences, they are pleas'd to pa&s;s upon others; or, the de&s;igns and purpo&s;es they have laid again&s;t them. They are often ready to flatter them&s;elves into an opi|nion of their own power, and to be confident of the &s;ucce&s;s of their own projects; that they &s;hall be able to wreck their malice upon their e|nemies, and to make them as mi&s;erable, as they would wi&s;h them to be. But, as they are not ble&s;s'd, whom they ble&s;s; &s;o, neither are they curs'd, whom they cur&s;e. There is a &s;upreme LORD over them, and an their de&s;igns, who will not &s;uffer them to proceed according to their hearts lu&s;t, but directs all with a different view.

<P N="2">(2.) As they have not in their power, to make whom they plea&s;e cur&s;ed; &s;o neither does a holy and righteous GOD regard their Cur&s;e, to exe|cute it. GOD is indeed a GOD of recompences; but where the Cur&s;e is cau&s;ele&s;s, and unde&s;erved, his Ju&s;tice no way obliges him to fulfil it.

GOD is the patron of the innocent and oppre&s;&s;|ed; and the more any are abus'd and run down wrongfully, the greater is his compa&s;&s;ion and fa|vour toward them. GOD will not have fellow|&s;hip with the workers of iniquity, nor take part with them in their &s;pite, &s;o far is he from this, that he has made this very treatment an argument of their ble&s;&s;edne&s;s. <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed are ye,</HI> &s;ays Chri&s;t, <HI>when men &s;hall revile you, and per&s;ecute you, and &s;ay all manner of evil again&s;t you fal&s;ely for my &s;ake.

Our bu&s;ine&s;s is to pity, and pray for them, that the Cur&s;e they impre|cate upon others, may, by their timely re|pentance, be prevented from ever falling up|on them&s;elves.</P>
<P N="4">4. LET us hence learn our duty to tru&s;t in GOD, and be the more careful to perform it. We ought to tru&s;t in him, to keep us from the mi&s;chief our enemies would be glad to &s;ee fall upon us. Thus <HI>David</HI> incourag'd him&s;elf in the LORD his GOD, when <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> curs'd him: <HI>It may be the Lord will look upon my affliction, and that the Lord will requite me good for his cur&s;ing this day.</HI> 2 Sam. 17. 12. Let their malice drive us to our refuge, and make us the more confident in our prayers to GOD for his Ble&s;&s;ing. The more &s;incerely and heartily we tru&s;t in him, the more ea&s;y we may well be: for this is a certain method of turning their cur&s;e to an advantage. And therefore let us &s;ay with <HI>David: Let them cur&s;e, but ble&s;s thou.</HI> P&s;al. 109. 28.</P>
