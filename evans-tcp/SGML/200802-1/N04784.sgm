<P>'_TIS very ob&s;ervable in the &s;acred Oracles, that the be&s;t of Men are oft Times warned again&s;t the wor&s;t of Vices. And whoever con&s;iders the Behaviour of others, of the Fee|blene&s;s of tho&s;e gracious Principles in him&s;elf, the Craft of Satan, the Treachery of his own Heart; how apt he is to neglect his &s;piritual Watch, and the Sudden|ne&s;s or Violence of Temptation, will ea&s;ily acknowledge
<PB N="6" REF="005969_0004_102718C673EFB338">
&s;uch Cautions good and nece&s;&s;ary. Behold <HI>Peter, Peter</HI> a Di&s;ciple, <HI>Peter</HI> an Apo&s;tle, yea, the Chief of the Apo&s;tles, what a gallant Re&s;olution doth he make, that he will ra|ther <HI>die for,</HI> than <HI>deny</HI> his LORD; and yet in an unguar|ded Hour, how doth his Faith fail, his Courage wither, while he becomes the boa&s;ted Prey of <HI>Satan,</HI> and the Conque&s;t of a trifling <HI>Girl!</HI> Alas, Once abandon'd of divine Grace, and there is no Temptation that Satan can lay before us, but we &s;hould greedily catch at, and be caught by. Will it not hold then, my Brethren, by a Parity of Rea&s;on, that the be&s;t of <HI>Soldiers</HI> may be warn'd again&s;t that <HI>Cowardize,</HI> which is incon&s;i&s;tent with their Character, as Vice is with that of a Chri&s;tian? Yes; and whoever con&s;iders the Source of Cowardize, the many Things that expo&s;e to it, the pernicious Effects and Con&s;equences of it, and that Men naturally the mo&s;t Valiant, have at particular Times been betrayed into it, will ea&s;ily acknowledge, that a <HI>Caveat</HI> again&s;t it, at all Times, and e&s;pecially in Time of <HI>War,</HI> is neither un|nece&s;&s;ary, nor un&s;ea&s;onable. Let this then, at lea&s;t, plead my Excu&s;e in the Choice of my Text on this Occa&s;ion, and in the Cautions and Coun&s;els that may be offer'd from it. My Fathers and Brethren, whom you have pre&s;s'd into your Service on the like Occa&s;ions, have in a manner &s;earch'd out every &s;uitable Subject, and ex|hau&s;ted it: They have pointed you to the dreadful Ori|gins of <HI>War,</HI> far more dreadful than all the Artillery of the Warriour; they have &s;hewn it's Lawfulne&s;s in this pre&s;ent corrupt E&s;tate, in what Manner, on what Principles, and with what Views, it mu&s;t be enter'd into and carried on; they have al&s;o &s;anctify'd your Arms, and engag'd you in an holy War, have di&s;played the Chri&s;tian Banner, enter'd your Names on CHRIST'S Mu&s;ter-Roll, furni&s;h'd you with Arms, and &s;how'd you your Strength, &s;ounded the Trumpet, mu&s;ter'd your Forces and mar&s;hall'd 'em under the Command of JEHOVAH, the <HI>Lord of Ho&s;ts</HI>; they have led forth the
<PB N="7" REF="005969_0005_102718C99C0CD8E0">
Armys of the living GOD, animating you to Battle with the Example of renowned Renowned Heroes, Men of War, and led you on to Victory in the Pro&s;pect of tho&s;e divine Honours, that are the Reward of Conque&s;t, placing you on the Throne of CHRIST, even as He al&s;o having overcome is &s;it down with his Father on his Throne. After &s;o much &s;aid, and &s;aid &s;o well, what remains for me, unle&s;s to guard you again&s;t all <HI>Cowardize,</HI> &s;hewing &s;omething of it's Cau&s;es and Effects, the Dan|ger of it, and the Way of e&s;caping that Danger? And to the&s;e Ends, what Words can be more &s;uitable, than tho&s;e of my Text? <HI>The Children of</HI> Ephraim <HI>being ar|med and carrying Bows, turned back in the Day of Battle: They kept not the Covenant of GOD, and refu&s;ed to walk in his Law.</HI></P>
<P>In the&s;e Words you have <HI>Cowardize</HI> painted in it's blacke&s;t Colours, drawn to the full length of Deformity, and glaring with lively Horror. Cowardize is ba&s;e in it &s;elf, and ju&s;tly dete&s;ted in all, more &s;o in Men of a military Character, who by their Profe&s;&s;ion proclaim their Courage; more abundantly &s;o in them while in their martial Habit, equip'd with all the In&s;truments of War; and mo&s;t of all &s;o, in the Day and upon the Field of Battle. What an Ab&s;urdity in Nature, What a Soleci&s;m in War, fir&s;t to Sound the On&s;et, and in&s;tantly beat a Retreat? And yet this &s;eems to be the Behaviour of the Children of <HI>Ephraim</HI> in my Text: Their Cha|racter was Martial, their Habit Millitary; they were <HI>arm'd</HI> and <HI>carrying Bows</HI>: By which may perhaps be under&s;tood, that they were arm'd for Defence, as well as Offence; probably they had the Habergeon or Cor|&s;let, the Shield and Buckler, as well as the Sword and Bow: And yet after all, they <HI>turned back in the Day of Battle.</HI> I know not whether the in&s;pired P&s;almi&s;t intended a Pathos, when he &s;pake of tho&s;e Per&s;ons as the <HI>Children</HI> of <HI>Ephraim</HI>; but &s;ure 'tis with great Pro|priety,
<PB N="8" REF="005969_0006_102718CC53ACD5B0">
that he calls them <HI>Children,</HI> who were far from <HI>quitting them&s;elves as Men,</HI> e&s;pecially as Men of War. If this &s;hould be thought too much a Critici&s;m, or Fine&s;&s;e, yet &s;ure in the&s;e Per&s;ons Cowardice and Di&s;grace appear in horrid Triumph. Behold 'em (my Brethren) fir&s;t looking their Enemy in the Face, and then turning their Backs in a Fright: Now &s;trutting in Armour, as if a&s;|&s;ur'd of Victory, and then flinging away their Arms, as a Weight that would hinder them in their Flight; fir&s;t they &s;hew their Teeth, and then their Heels, and with the Countenance of a Lion, they cover the Heart of an Hare. Methinks this Picture &s;tares &s;o &s;trongly, as not only to make the valiant Man more abundantly to abhor Cowardize, but al&s;o to make the mo&s;t Pu&s;illanimous afraid of being tho't &s;o, yea, grow Courageous thro' very Cowardize. But who are they that are thus de&s;crib'd? My Text &s;peaks of the&s;e Per&s;ons as being <HI>the Children of</HI> Ephraim.</P>
<P>By <HI>Ephraim,</HI> we are &s;ometimes in Scripture led to under&s;tand a particular Per&s;on, the younge&s;t Son of <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI>; &s;ometimes a particular Tribe, in Con&s;equence of that adopting Grant, which <HI>Jacob</HI> made to his two Grand&s;ons <HI>Ephraim</HI> and <HI>Mana&s;&s;eh,</HI> whom he numbred among his own immediate Off&s;pring, and ble&s;&s;ed as if they had been &s;o indeed; making them Heads of di&s;|tinct Tribes, even as <HI>Reuben</HI> and <HI>Simeon.</HI></P>
<P>Sometimes by <HI>Ephraim</HI> we are to under&s;tand the Ten Tribes, which revolted in the Days of <HI>Rehoboam,</HI> or <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> as oppo&s;ed to <HI>Judah</HI>: And they are called <HI>Ephraim,</HI> as this was the mo&s;t Valiant of the Tribes; or perhaps becau&s;e <HI>Jeroboam,</HI> the principal Author of this Revolt, was an <HI>Ephraimite.</HI></P>
<P>Sometimes again, by <HI>Ephraim,</HI> we are to under&s;tand the whole Body of the <HI>I&s;raeliti&s;h</HI> Nation: So in <HI>Jerem.</HI> 31.9, 20. the Divine Being is bro't in &s;aying, Ephraim <HI>is my dear Son, my fir&s;t born</HI>: Which, be&s;ides that it is not true of <HI>Ephraim</HI> con&s;idered as a &s;ingle Per&s;on, or
<PB N="9" REF="005969_0007_102718CF04367208">
particular Tribe, or the ten Tribes, is the very &s;ame Phra&s;e which GOD put into the Mouth of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> when he &s;ent him as Amba&s;&s;ador to <HI>Pharoah,</HI> to demand Li|berty for his People to go and &s;acrifice. <HI>Thus &s;halt thou &s;ay to</HI> Pharaoh (&s;ays GOD) I&s;rael <HI>is my Son, even my First-born.</HI> Exod. 4.22.</P>
<P>What we are to under&s;tand by <HI>Ephraim</HI> in my Text, can only be learnt from the Story to which it relates. But here the Learned differ. Some &s;uppo&s;e it to have Re&s;pect to the Defeat of the Children of <HI>Ephraim,</HI> recorded 1 <HI>Chron.</HI> 7.20, -22. and &s;o by <HI>Ephraim</HI> would be under&s;tood a particular Per&s;on: But the Defeat being previous to the coming of the Children of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> out of <HI>Egypt,</HI> is of too early a Date for the P&s;alm before us, which contains a Record of Tran&s;actions commencing with that Depar|ture. Others &s;uppo&s;e, our Text relates to &s;omething con&s;equent to the Revolt of <HI>Jeroboam</HI>; and &s;o by <HI>Ephra|im</HI> would under&s;tand the Ten Tribes: But the&s;e &s;eem to be of too late a Date for the Story referr'd to; our P&s;alm ending with <HI>David,</HI> who died before that Revolt. Others therefore, more ju&s;tly refer the Pa&s;&s;age to the whole Body of the <HI>I&s;raeliti&s;h</HI> Nation; our P&s;alm containing a Regi&s;ter of memorable Things from their coming out of <HI>Egypt</HI> to the Settlement of the Government in the Hou&s;e of <HI>David.</HI> But yet what particular Piece of Hi&s;tory our Text relates to, we are yet at a lo&s;s. Some &s;uppo&s;e their Refu&s;al to go up and fight the Inhabitants of <HI>Ca|naan,</HI> at the Command of GOD, to be pointed at; or their turning their Backs on the <HI>Amorites,</HI> when without GOD's Pre&s;ence, and contrary to his Command, they ra&s;hly encountred them: So Bi&s;hop <HI>Patrick.</HI> Others, particularly Me&s;&s;irs. <HI>Henry</HI> and <HI>Pool,</HI> &s;uppo&s;e the Defeat by the <HI>Phili&s;tines</HI> (mentioned 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 4.) when the <HI>Ark of God</HI> was taken Pri&s;oner, to be the Story alluded to: And &s;o they connect our Text with the 59^t^h Ver&s;e of the P&s;alm, where GOD is &s;aid to have <HI>abhorred</HI> I&s;rael <HI>&s;o that he for&s;ook the Tabernacle of</HI> Shiloh, <HI>the Tent which be
<PB N="10" REF="005969_0008_102718D1B5081878">
placed among Men,</HI> and <HI>delivered his Strength,</HI> that is, the Ark of his Strength, <HI>into Captivity, and his Glory,</HI> which re&s;ted on the Wings of the Cherubims over the Ark, <HI>into the Enemies Hands.</HI></P>
<P>But not to trouble my &s;elf or you about this Matter, 'tis of more Importance to ob&s;erve that their Want of <HI>Courage</HI> was owing to their Want of <HI>Religion.</HI> This is plainly intimated in the latter Clau&s;e of the Text, where 'tis &s;aid of them, <HI>They kept not the Covenant of their God, and refu&s;ed to walk in his Law.</HI> As GOD had cho&s;en that People out of all the Nations of the Earth, to be a peculiar Trea&s;ure to him&s;elf; &s;o did he enter into <HI>Covenant</HI> with them by Sacrifice, wherein he engaged to be their GOD, and they engaged to be his People, promi&s;ing that <HI>all which God &s;hould &s;ay, they would hear and do.</HI> Ac|cordingly being now in a peculiar Manner King in <HI>Je&s;hu|run,</HI> GOD gave his Laws to <HI>Jacob,</HI> and his Statutes and Ordinances to his People <HI>I&s;rael</HI>: But alas, they &s;oon <HI>de&s;pi&s;ed the Oath, in breaking the Covenant, when lo, they had given God the Hand</HI>; they provoked GOD to Anger with their high Places, and moved Him to Jea|lou&s;y with their graven Images. No wonder now <HI>they turned their Back</HI> on their Enemy, &s;ince they had turned their Back on GOD, and he on them: No wonder they were Cowards towards Men, being Guilty before GOD: No wonder they could not perform any martial Atchieve|ments, &s;ince (in the Words of D. <HI>Hammond</HI>) they were armed with Bows, but not with Grace. The Words being thus introduced, we may &s;peak to them under the following Remarks, &mdash;
<LIST>
<ITEM>In the Fir&s;t Place, There may be much of a <HI>martial Habit</HI> and <HI>Appearance,</HI> where there is nothing of a true <HI>martial Spirit.</HI> Without which,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Secondly, The mo&s;t &s;hining Armour and glittering Appearance will <HI>avail nothing</HI> to the ju&s;t Purpo&s;es of <HI>War.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="11" REF="005969_0009_102718D4C3EB6EE8">Thirdly, The <HI>best Method</HI> of <HI>obtaining</HI> a true martial Spirit, or Spirit of true Fortitude, is the <HI>Practice</HI> of <HI>Religion.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>There may be much of a martial</HI> Habit <HI>and</HI> Ap|pearance, <HI>where there is nothing of a true martial</HI> Spirit. &mdash; I di&s;tingui&s;h here between a mere martial Spirit, and a true martial one, or a Spirit of true Fortitude. The one is only natural Courage, which has its Foundation in the Con&s;titution of the Body; the other is that ju&s;t Tem|perament and di&s;creet Management of Courage, which is &s;eated in the Mind. The one acts without Thought or Reflection, and &s;o is little better than the Valour of a Brute; the other is the Product of Thought and Judge|ment, and &s;o the Fortitude of a Philo&s;opher. I confe&s;s, that I have no need of this Di&s;tinction here; for which Rea&s;on I &s;hall defer any Enlargement upon it. No need of it here, I &s;ay, becau&s;e there may be much of a martial <HI>Habit</HI> and <HI>Appearance</HI> where there is no martial <HI>Spirit</HI> at all, or none in Exerci&s;e.</P>
<P>The martial Habit is ea&s;ily procur'd, the red Coat worn, perhaps for no other End but to conceal a pallid Spirit, that is loth to appear; the glittering Sword ea&s;ily put on, while the Man that &s;hould draw it, cannot find his Hands: The Feather it&s;elf may wave upon the Hat of one, who&s;e Head is equally light, and his Heart equally trembling. This may be the Signal of &s;uperiour Favour, not of Courage; or it may be the Rights of external Succe&s;&s;ion, where there is no Right founded on any in|ternal valorous Di&s;po&s;itions; yea, the Commi&s;&s;ion, as well as the Habit, may be the Purcha&s;e of Money, to the ju&s;t Infamy and Reproach both of Buyers and Sellers. I know here that Cu&s;tom will plead the Cau&s;e of the&s;e Per&s;ons; but Cu&s;tom is a pitiful Advocate, where there is not &s;omething in Rea&s;on for it; and a de&s;picable one where Rea&s;on oppo&s;es it: In the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e, to be &s;ure, it pleads with weak Nerves and in&s;ipid Eloquence; taking
<PB N="12" REF="005969_0010_102718D77B9A9F08">
its Arguments from Covetou&s;ne&s;s in one, fal&s;e Honour in the other, a &s;elfi&s;h Spirit in both, rather than a public Spiritne&s;s in either, or a due Regard to their Country's Welfare: The Con&s;equences of which may not only be ea&s;ily conceived greatly mi&s;chievous, but we have Rea|&s;on to fear that &s;ometimes in Fact the Sale of Commi&s;&s;ions has been the Sale of a Country's Glory. Thus the mar|tial Habit and Commi&s;&s;ion it&s;elf may be only the Tokens of Favour, the Right of Succe&s;&s;ion, or the Purcha&s;e of Money; which neither &s;uppo&s;e or acquire the martial Spirit, no more than a Lion's Skin will influence a Lion's Heart. Accordingly <HI>Ephraim,</HI> notwith&s;tanding his <HI>Bow</HI> and <HI>Armour,</HI> is repre&s;ented by the Prophet as <HI>a &s;illy Dove without Heart. (Ho&s;.</HI> 7.11.) The Martial Spirit is not the Purcha&s;e of Money; but we may &s;ay of it as the Divine Oracles &s;peak of <HI>Love,</HI> if a Man would give <HI>all the Sub&s;tance of his Hou&s;e for it,</HI> it would <HI>utterly be con|temned</HI>: Nor is it the Effect of humane Favour; but a free Gift of the GOD of Nature, who is the Former of Man's Body and the Father of his Spirit, and has the Hearts of all Men in his Hand: Nor doth Courage merely depend upon GOD for its Being, but al&s;o for its Exerci&s;e. Accordingly, when GOD promi&s;es to give his People the Land of <HI>Canaan,</HI> inhabited by War-like Nations, he tells them, that He would <HI>&s;end his Fear and Terror before them, &s;o that their Enemies &s;hould turn their Backs,</HI> Ex. 23.27. which Promi&s;e you find was made good, by the Account of <HI>Rahab,</HI> who informed the Spies, &s;aying, <HI>Your Terror is fallen upon us; and all the Inhabitants of the Land faint becau&s;e of you: For we have heard what the Lord has done for you; and as &s;oon as we had heard, our Hearts did melt, neither did there remain any more Courage in any Man becau&s;e of you.</HI> (Jo&s;h. 2.9, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>) Accordingly 'tis reported in the <HI>Jeru|&s;alem Gemara</HI> (as quoted by the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Eli</HI>) that the <HI>Girga&s;hites</HI> particularly fled, at the Approach of <HI>Jo&s;hua,</HI> into <HI>Africa</HI>; and that in the Days of <HI>Alexander</HI> they &s;ued
<PB N="13" REF="005969_0011_102718DA33C49040">
to be re&s;tored to the Land of <HI>Canaan,</HI> from whence they had been driven out. And as it has been with Nations collectively, &s;o has it been with particular Per&s;ons, even renowned Commanders them&s;elves; who have freely owned, that when no extraordinary Danger appeared, yet from &s;ome &s;ecret and unknown Cau&s;e, by &s;ome &s;trange Influence that came they knew not by what Means, nor how or why, their wonted Courage has fail'd, and their Hearts &s;unk within them: So <HI>Hannibal,</HI> tho' in Sight of <HI>Rome,</HI> yet <HI>non Au&s;us est ob&s;idere.</HI> I mention the&s;e Things to &s;how where our Dependance mu&s;t be, as for the Principle, &s;o for the Exerci&s;e of Courage, own in GOD alone, who is the Strength of our Hearts as well as Hands. But I intend not to dwell on this Propo&s;ition, and tru&s;t you will forgive me this Wrong. &mdash; So I pa&s;s to my next Propo&s;ition, which is,</P>
<P N="2">II. That <HI>without the true martial</HI> Spirit, <HI>the Spirit of true</HI> Fortitude, <HI>the most &s;hining Armour and glittering Appearance will</HI> avail nothing <HI>to the genuine Purpo&s;es of</HI> War.</P>
<P>That I may lead your Thoughts into the proper Pur|po&s;es of War, and the Nece&s;&s;ity of true Fortitude, to an&s;wer tho&s;e Purpo&s;es; Let me begin with the Con&s;ide|ration of the <HI>Lawfulne&s;s</HI> of <HI>War</HI>: This &s;tands upon the Foot of <HI>Nature,</HI> and is ju&s;tified by the Principle of Self-Pre&s;ervation, which the Divine Creator has implanted in us. We may range our Thoughts in the following man|ner; Two Per&s;ons having each of them equal or indeed any Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, have an undoubted Right to what they po&s;&s;e&s;s; whether their Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions be given 'em by the GOD of Nature, or acquired by their own Indu&s;try under the Smiles of the GOD of Providence; and neither of the&s;e Per&s;ons has a Right to the other's Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion: If one then endeavours to deprive the other of his Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, he u&s;urps a Right which he has not, and there being by that Suppo&s;ition no e&s;tabli&s;hed Government, the latter has a
<PB N="14" REF="005969_0012_102718DBD4A6FCC0">
Right to defend his own Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, though it be at the Expence of the Life of the U&s;urper. The Ca&s;e is the &s;ame with Regard to two Nations: Their Men, their Merchandize their Territories are their own: If one then u&s;urps a Right over the other, the latter may ju&s;tly draw the Sword in Vindication of its own Rights, and there being no &s;upe|riour Judicature on Earth, hereby appeal to the GOD of Heaven. Thus Nature will allow the u&s;e of the Sword, even the fir&s;t drawing of it, &s;ince this is not properly the Commencement of the War, but only the ju&s;t Re&s;ent|ment of U&s;urpation. &mdash; Nor doth the <HI>Revelation of</HI> GOD lay us under any interdict in this Matter; no, but leaves the&s;e Things ju&s;t as it finds them: It labours indeed to take away the Cau&s;e; and were the Revelation fully and practically embraced, we &s;hould &s;oon find <HI>Wars</HI> to <HI>cea&s;e on the Earth</HI>; but the Cau&s;e remaining, it ju&s;tifies the Effect. So under the Old Te&s;tament Di&s;pen&s;ation, GOD repre&s;ents Him&s;elf as <HI>a Man of War,</HI> teaches his People's Hands to war, and their Fingers to fight, makes the Battle his own, fights for his People, a&s;&s;ures them of and crowns them with Succe&s;s and Victory. And doth not the New Te&s;tament &s;ufficiently countenance War; notwith&s;tanding all that has been &s;aid by the Followers of <HI>Socinus,</HI> or others of an Enthu&s;ia&s;tick Turn: Did <HI>John Baptist</HI> di&s;band the <HI>Soldiers,</HI> when they a&s;k'd him, <HI>What they &s;hould do?</HI> Did our Saviour command the Officers to lay by their Commi&s;&s;ions, and lay down their Swords, when he &s;et him&s;elf before them as their Leader, and bid 'em follow him? By no means.

To what Purpo&s;es of War do the&s;e &s;erve, unle&s;s to brighten the Enemy's Conque&s;t, and adorn their Triumph?

too, yet without <HI>true</HI> Fortitude will the&s;e Things do nothing towards an&s;wering the true Purpo&s;es of War. We have, my Brethren, already a&s;&s;erted the Lawfulne&s;s of War; but it is not every War that is lawful; per|haps no Offen&s;ive one, properly &s;o called. The <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> indeed war'd again&s;t the Inhabitants of <HI>Canaan,</HI> and took their Land for a Prey. But the War was <HI>not theirs,</HI> but <HI>GOD</HI>'s; who being ju&s;tly offended at the <HI>Mea&s;ure of their Iniquities,</HI> which was now <HI>full,</HI> had a Right to puni&s;h the Offenders, and employ whom He pleas'd as the In&s;truments of his Vengeance. Had they not by their Iniquities commenc'd a War with GOD, he had not come out in Battle again&s;t them. This Example then will not ju&s;tify an offen&s;ive War; unle&s;s &s;uch an One as is entered into for the Recovery of tho&s;e Rights that a Nation has been robb'd of; which is therefore improperly call'd Offen&s;ive. But now if we examine the Generality of Wars that have been upon the the Earth; for what Ends have they been under|taken, unle&s;s to &s;atiate Ambition, and glut the Maw of Covetou&s;ne&s;s, to &s;pread the Fame of Conquerors, and convey their Glory to Po&s;terity, as if after Death, they were to have the plea&s;ing Sen&s;e that their Glory was was yet alive? What el&s;e were the Wars of <HI>Alexander</HI> and of <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI>? Were they not to enlarge their Terri|tories, or &s;ee how far they could carry their Swords, how many Widows they cou'd make, how much Blood they could &s;hed, how many Slaves they cou'd con&s;titute! For &s;uch ba&s;e and &s;ordid Ends, Millions have been made a Sacrifice; but a Sacrifice without Mercy; yea, Mercy it &s;elf was &s;acrificed to their ungodly Lu&s;ts. How ig|noble was that in <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar,</HI> which <HI>Suetonius</HI> reports? <HI>Animadver&s;&acirc; apud</HI> Herculis <HI>Templum, magni</HI> Alexandri <HI>imagine, ingemuit; qua&s;i pertae&s;us Ignaviam &s;uam, quod nihil dum &acirc; &s;e Memorabile Actum e&s;&s;et, in Aetate qu&acirc; jam</HI> Alexander <HI>Orbem Terrarum &s;ubegi&s;&s;et.</HI> Here was his End, to do &s;omething <HI>Memorable,</HI> without any Re|gard

to the moral Nature of the Thing, whether good or bad. But now the true Purpo&s;e and genuine End of War is <HI>Peace</HI>; in the Language of <HI>Cicero, Ita Bellum &s;u&s;cipiatur, ut nihil aliud quam Pax quae&s;ita, Videatur.</HI> This End is noble, generous and publick &s;pirited, worthy the highe&s;t Rea&s;on of Man, worthy of CHRIST that glorious Peace-Maker between GOD and Man, and worthy of that GOD, one of who&s;e amiable Characters is, that He is the <HI>GOD of Peace.</HI>&mdash; The Thing then implied in the Propo&s;ition is the Nece&s;&s;ity of true Fortitude to an&s;wer the genuine and only proper De&s;ign of War.</P>
<P>Here you demand, what is this <HI>Fortitude?</HI> You may remember, that under my fir&s;t Propo&s;ition I touch'd on the Di&s;tinction between natural Courage and true Forti|tude: Here let me a little enlarge, and &s;ay, That natural Courage, which properly &s;peaking, is nothing but Strength with a Plerophory of animal Spirits, is mere Con&s;titution, owing to the Mechani&s;m of our bodily Nature, the Structure of the Solids, and the Temperament of the Fluids; but this is no more a Virtue (and &s;o it is that I am here con&s;idering of Fortitude, as a moral Virtue) to enjoy, than it is a Vice to want it. This indeed often pa&s;&s;es under the Name of Fortitude, merely becau&s;e it de&s;pi&s;es Danger: And when it has pu&s;h'd Men on to &s;ome bold Attempts, which have been crowned with Succe&s;s, it has a World of Eloquence pro&s;tituted in its Prai&s;e. When at the &s;ame Time all Mankind mu&s;t own, that &s;eparating the Succe&s;s from the Attempt, it would be called by its right Name, that of criminal Ra&s;hne&s;s: Such Folly is in Man, to judge of Things by their Suc|ce&s;s, as if this alone alter'd the Nature of them, and made that a Virtue at one Time, which would be a Fault at ano|ther. Much of this natural Courage there may be where there is not the lea&s;t true Fortitude: this the Children of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> demon&s;trated, when they dar'd to a&s;&s;ault the <HI>Amorites,</HI> tho' God him&s;elf had forbidden 'em, a&s;&s;uring
<PB N="18" REF="005969_0016_102718E845192D00">
that they &s;hould not pro&s;per. On the other Hand, there may be much of true Fortitude, where there is little or nothing of natural Courage: So Multitudes <HI>out of Weak|ne&s;s were made &s;trong, turned to flight the Armies of Aliens</HI>; and when they could not conquer, &s;ubmitted to the greate&s;t Tortures with an unbroken Mind, and even dar'd to <HI>die.</HI> &mdash; By this Time it may be known what I under&s;tand by true Fortitude: It is that Virtue of Mind, by which upon &s;olid and rational Principles, we are di&s;|pos'd nobly to with&s;tand any Oppo&s;itions, encounter any Dangers, endure any Hard&s;hips, and &s;ubmit to any Sufferings, when they cannot be avoided <HI>&s;alva Veritate &amp; Con&s;cientia,</HI> with the Pre&s;ervation of Truth and Con|&s;cience. The Foundation of Fortitude is Principle, the Path of it is Duty, let the End or Succe&s;s be what it will. By the&s;e De&s;criptions you &s;ee that 'tis not natural Cou|rage, any more than natural Fear, but the ju&s;t Manage|ment of both, in a Readine&s;s to encounter any Dangers, or &s;ubmit to any Sufferings we are called to. Natural Courage may ru&s;h into a thou&s;and Dangers, which Forti|tude forbids becau&s;e they are needle&s;s: Natural Fear may &s;hun as many Dangers, which Fortitude commands us to encounter, becau&s;e they are Matters of Duty. True Fortitude then regulates Courage on the one Hand, and &s;ubdues Fear on the other. Some indeed &s;eem to think that Fortitude and Fear are incon&s;i&s;tent: This doubtle&s;s is a great Mi&s;take; &s;ince the mo&s;t timerous may acquire the Character of the true Hero, in the ju&s;t Management of his Fears, and has the be&s;t Right to that Character in Proportion to tho&s;e Fears which his Fortitude overcomes. Have not we an eminent In&s;tance of the Con&s;i&s;tency there is between Fear and Fortitude in the three <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Wor|thies, <HI>Shadrach, Me&s;heck,</HI> and <HI>Abednego?</HI> To &s;ay, that the&s;e Per&s;ons were de&s;titute of Fear, when they found an haughty Monarch threatning of and the madde&s;t Flames preparing for them, is to &s;ay, that they belied their Na|tures, and renounced their Humanity; but when by a

due Management of their Fears, which they &s;ubjected to the Cau&s;e of Rea&s;on, Religion, and of GOD, they nobly replied, <HI>O Nebuchadnezzar, we are not careful to an&s;wer thee in this Matter: If it be &s;o, our GOD, whom we &s;erve, is able to deliver us from the burning fiery Furnace, and he will deliver us out of thine Hand, O King: But if not, be it known to thee, O King, that we will not &s;erve thy Gods, nor wor&s;hip the golden Image which thou hast &s;et up.</HI> (Dan. 3.16, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>) Here was a Fortitude triumphing over Fear, a Fortitude far exceeding that of an <HI>Alexander,</HI> or a <HI>Cae&s;ar.</HI> Yes, they lov'd their Lives, but they lov'd their GOD more, with a Love <HI>&s;trong as Death,</HI> which many Waters could not quench, Floods drown, nor Fire con&s;ume. Here was more true Heroi&s;m than in <HI>Cato,</HI> who when he could not conquer was too much of a Coward to live under the Shame of being conquer'd. But in the God-Man, our Lord JESUS CHRIST, this Con&s;i&s;tency between Fear and Fortitude appears in &s;trong and amiable Colours: <HI>He feared,</HI> &s;o &s;ays the Apo&s;tle, Yes, and in the greatne&s;s of his Fear <HI>prayed, that the bitter Cup might pa&s;s from him</HI>; yet how did his Fortitude overcome his Fears, when he &s;et his Face to go up to <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> the Scene of Sufferings and of Blood, went <HI>before</HI> his Di&s;ciples, as one that was in ha&s;te, was <HI>&s;traitned</HI> till this <HI>Bapti&s;m</HI> of Blood &s;hould be accompli&s;hed; and when his Hour was come, he made that his Choice, which could not have been his Nece&s;&s;ity, bowing his &s;acred Shoulders to the accur&s;ed <HI>Cro&s;s,</HI> that had the Weight of all the Sins of GOD's Elect laid upon it! Thus is Fortitude con&s;i&s;tent with Fear.</P>
<P>Now this Fortitude, My Brethren, is nece&s;&s;ary to an|&s;wer the ju&s;t Purpo&s;es of <HI>War</HI>; and indeed the whole Management of it. This directs the <HI>End,</HI> guards a|gain&s;t every Thing mean and &s;elfi&s;h, di&s;dains the fal&s;e Plumage of Ambition, and abhors the Gra&s;p of Cove|tou&s;ne&s;s, and only &s;ounds the Trump of War for the De&s;truction of tho&s;e Lu&s;ts, which hinder Peace on the
<PB N="20" REF="005969_0018_102718ED44A3E590">
Earth. This, again, befriends the ju&s;t <HI>Management</HI> of War; pre&s;erving the Mind in a &s;weet Calm, in Oppo|&s;ition to tho&s;e Perturbations, which natural Fear, or mere natural Courage excites. This prepares the Mind for Victory, on the one Hand, or a Defeat on the other; for Life, or for Death. Are our Arms pro&s;perous, it &s;uffers no undue Elation of Mind in our &s;elves; far le&s;s, Inclemency towards others. Cowardize is generally Cruel; but Fortitude alway Mercifull: It can weep over the Mi&s;eries, which it &s;elf occa&s;ions; and as <HI>Alex|ander</HI> did by his Friend, pull off the Linnen Crown, to bind up the Wounds of an Enemy. But the Glory of Fortitude, like that of GOD, &s;hines thro' the darke&s;t Cloud; it doth not like <HI>Bajazet,</HI> foam and fret, cur&s;e it's Di&s;appointments, and gnaw it's Chains; far from this, it &s;ubmits to tho&s;e unhappy Things it could not avoid, and amid&s;t Bonds and Impri&s;onments, can make that it's Language, <HI>None of the&s;e Things move me, nei|ther count I my Life dear</HI>: 'Tis Satisfaction eno' to have endeavour'd my Duty, and leave the Event with GOD.</P>
<P>But I ha&s;ten to my la&s;t Propo&s;ition,</P>
<P N="3">III. <HI>The be&s;t Method of</HI> obtaining <HI>this Fortitude, is, the Practice of true</HI> Religion. &mdash; I &s;ay, the <HI>Practice</HI> of true Religion, in Contradi&s;tinction to the mere <HI>Know|ledge</HI> of it; the <HI>Power of Godline&s;s,</HI> not the mere <HI>Form.</HI> The latter <HI>Ephraim</HI> had, but not the former; and there|fore <HI>turned their Back in the Day of Battle.</HI></P>
<P>Guilt, my Brethren, is the Parent of Cowardize. No &s;ooner had <HI>Adam</HI> fallen, but he <HI>hides</HI> him&s;elf in the <HI>Trees of the Garden,</HI> and confe&s;&s;es to GOD, <HI>I was afraid, be|cau&s;e I was naked,</HI> &s;trip'd of my Robes of Innocence. So <HI>Cain</HI> having &s;lain his Brother, immediately &s;iez'd by Fear and Trembling, and with a Coward's Voice crys out, <HI>Every one that findeth me will &s;lay me.</HI> This is always the Ca&s;e; but Guilt contracted by the Violation
<PB N="21" REF="005969_0019_102718F12476BB68">
of <HI>Covenant-Bonds,</HI> has a peculiar Tendency to make the Hands weak, and the Heart faint. GOD then ap|pears at the Head of the Enemy, to e&s;pou&s;e the <HI>Quar|rel</HI> of his broken <HI>Covenant.</HI> No wonder then our Ene|mies appear as Giants and we as Gra&s;hoppers; and that a View of that Covenant, which with our Hand we have &s;igned, and of that Vengeance, which by our Guilt we have challeng'd, &s;hould make our Hearts melt within us. <HI>Ephraim</HI> might perhaps remember that Threatning of the Covenant in Ca&s;e of Di&s;obedience, <HI>that they &s;hould flee before their Enemies</HI>; and the very Remembrance might ha&s;ten its Fulfilment. But if they did not, yet the <HI>Terror</HI> it&s;elf was Part of GOD's threaten'd Anger. &mdash; On the other Hand true Religion is the Friend of the be&s;t Courage. <HI>Prov.</HI> 28.1. <HI>The Wicked flee when no Man pur&s;ueth; but the Righteous is bold as a Lion.</HI></P>
<P>Two Things here demand an Enquiry.&mdash;Fir&s;t, In what <HI>Re&s;pects</HI> is the Practice of Religion friendly to the Spirit of Fortitude. And, Secondly, By what <HI>Means</HI> is it &s;o.</P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>In what</HI> Re&s;pects <HI>is the Practice of Religion friendly to the Spirit of Fortitude?</HI></P>
<P>To which I an&s;wer,</P>
<P N="1">1. As it <HI>Removes</HI> the main <HI>Ob&s;tructions</HI> of true martial Courage. There are many Things which natu|rally as well as morally ob&s;truct the martial Spirit; par|ticularly here I might mention <HI>&s;en&s;ual Lusts,</HI> &s;uch as Whoredom, Drunkene&s;s, and the like. Wine in the moderate u&s;e of it, may indeed rai&s;e the Spirits; but &s;ure, in its Exce&s;s, <HI>Wine is a Mocker</HI>; and when <HI>Whoredom</HI> and <HI>Wine</HI> go together, then in the Language of the Prophet, (<HI>Ho&s;.</HI> 4.11.) they <HI>take away the Heart,</HI> they relax the Nerves, effeminate the Mind, and ema&s;culate the whole Man, rendering him not only unfit for, but indi&s;|pos'd to the Hard&s;hips and Hazards of War. Whereas now Religion has taught its Votary to mortify the&s;e Limbs of the <HI>Old Man,</HI> to <HI>crucify the Fle&s;h,</HI> with its
<PB N="22" REF="005969_0020_102718F421D6C3F8">
Lu&s;ts and Affections: However he may have wallowed in the&s;e Lu&s;ts; yet now is he <HI>wa&s;hed and &s;anctify'd and ju&s;tify'd in the Name of the Lord Je&s;us, and by the Spirit of his God.</HI> And tho' the animal Appetite may yet be left within him, yet its Dominion, which was but for a Time, is taken away; if the <HI>Canaanites</HI> are in the Land, <HI>I&s;rael</HI> is its Lord. &mdash; Again, An over-weening <HI>Fondne&s;s of Life,</HI> is another Ob&s;truction to the martial Spirit. Whoever over-rates his Life, mu&s;t needs be &s;uppos'd to over-rate that which indangers it; he looks upon Things through a fal&s;e Per&s;pective, and by magnifying every Danger avoids all. The Con&s;equence is, that however the be&s;t Intere&s;ts of his Country, Liberty, Learning and Re|ligion ly at Stake, he will have little Regard to the&s;e, &s;ince he prefers Life to 'em all. Let &s;uch a Man, like <HI>I&s;&s;achar,</HI> couch between Burdens; but &s;ure he is neither fit to draw the Bow of <HI>Ephraim,</HI> nor like, with <HI>Benjamin,</HI> to divide the Spoil. Far otherwi&s;e the true Soldier of JESUS CHRIST, he has weigh'd his Life in an even Bal|lance, and determined its true Value; he has parted with it intentionally, and is ready to part with it actually at the Call of his GOD, &s;aying with the P&s;almi&s;t, <HI>My Soul is in mine Hand, yet do I not forget thy Law.</HI>&mdash; The <HI>Fear of Death</HI> is another great Ob&s;truction to the martial Spirit. Death is the <HI>King of Terrors,</HI> peculi|arly &s;o in the Field: there he appears in all his Artil|lery, terrible in Glory. To prevent or cure this Fear, &s;ome endeavour to extingui&s;h all Tho't, and &s;o ru&s;h like the Hor&s;e into the Battle: While others preach to them&s;elves the Stoical-Doctrine of Fate, and are pleas'd to think, they &s;han't dy before their Time. However, 'tis hard to cancel the&s;e Fears, e&s;pecially where Guilt lies on the Con&s;cience uncancell'd by the Blood of Sprinkling, and there are any Pro&s;pects of another World, where <HI>Hell</HI> follows the <HI>Pale Hor&s;e.</HI> But now true Religion, as it makes Death familiar, &s;o it abates it's Terror; and exalted Religion in a manner extingui&s;hes
<PB N="23" REF="005969_0021_102718F60DAB11B8">
tho&s;e Fears. The chri&s;tian Soldier well knows, that his <HI>Captain</HI> has encountred Death, and onquer'd him, has entred into his Territorys, &s;anctify'd and perfum'd 'em, and then taken an everla&s;ting Leave of 'em; and that having <HI>de&s;troy'd Death,</HI> and <HI>him that had the Power of it, that is, the Devil,</HI> he has <HI>deliver'd</HI> them, who <HI>thro' Fear of Death, were &s;ubject unto Bondage.</HI> He therefore with a firm Courage, will &s;ay with <HI>David, Tho' I walk thro' the Valley of the Shadow of Death, I will fear no Evil</HI>: With <HI>Paul</HI> will in&s;ult Death, &s;aying, <HI>O Death, Where is thy Sting</HI>! 'Tis gone, 'tis gone, thou maye&s;t hi&s;s, but can&s;t not hurt. Yea, he may glory in Death, as knowing that this is Part of the Chri&s;tian's Inventory: Yes, not only <HI>Life</HI> is <HI>yours,</HI> &s;ays the Apo&s;tle, but <HI>Death</HI> too; the one to fit you for Heaven, and the other to tran&s;late you into it. Thus Religion removes the main Ob&s;tructions of martial Courage.</P>
<P N="2">2. True Religion <HI>in&s;pires</HI> the Man with <HI>Courage.</HI> &mdash; This it doth (1^s^t) By it's <HI>Precepts.</HI> As CHRIST our Leader bore his own <HI>Cro&s;s,</HI> and was <HI>made perfect thro' Sufferings,</HI> &s;o is the Word of Command given forth to all his Followers, <HI>Take up the Cro&s;s</HI>; this Word every true Chri&s;tian Soldier hears and obeys: Having weigh'd the Advantages of Religion in one Scale, and it's Di&s;|advantages in the other, he wi&s;ely <HI>reckons, that all the Sufferings of this pre&s;ent Time are not worthy to be com|par'd with the Glory that is to be revealed in us.</HI> And therefore he choo&s;es CHRIST with a Cro&s;s, before the World with a Crown, and &s;o becomes a Martyr in Re&s;o|lution; yea, he is actually &s;o, having learned to <HI>take up his Cro&s;s daily,</HI> by a gracious Encounter with all the Evils and Adver&s;ities of Life: The&s;e Things are what he allots upon, is prepared for, and engaged in. If he is not called with <HI>Paul</HI> to fight with Bea&s;ts at <HI>Ephe&s;us,</HI> he engages 'em nigher home: nor doth he only <HI>wre&s;tle with Fle&s;h and Blood</HI>; but <HI>with Princi|palities

and Powers and &s;piritual Wickedne&s;&s;es in high Places.</HI> Satan is daily making War upon him; but he <HI>overcomes thro' the Blood of the Lamb.</HI> In a word, he is daily batt'ling with him&s;elf; which requires more Courage, than to fight with others: He <HI>keeps under his Body,</HI> and combats with his <HI>Spirit,</HI> to &s;ubdue the <HI>Lu&s;ts of the Mind,</HI> as well as of the <HI>Fle&s;h</HI>: And &s;urely <HI>greater is he that hath rule over his own Spirit, than he that taketh a City.</HI> &mdash; If it be &s;aid here, that this Courage is of a &s;piritual Nature; 'tis granted, it is &s;piritual in it's Principle; but yet being drawn out to it's proper length, will di&s;po&s;e us to encounter any Enemy, and plunge into the greate&s;t Dangers of a temporal Nature. He that has the true <HI>Fear of GOD</HI> in it's lively Exerci&s;e, will not be <HI>afraid of Man that &s;hall die,</HI> and the <HI>Son of Man that is as Gra&s;s.</HI> The &s;ame Courage that dares to dy for CHRIST, will di&s;po&s;e us to <HI>play the Man for the Cities of our GOD,</HI> e&s;pecially when Religion it &s;elf is in Danger. Accordingly, primitive Chri&s;tianity will fur|ni&s;h us with numberle&s;s In&s;tances, in which, not only the naturally Brave and Valiant, but the mo&s;t Timerous be|came Magnanimous; the aged Matron, and the tender Virgin were in&s;pired with &s;uch an holy Courage, that they <HI>cho&s;e</HI> to <HI>&s;uffer Affliction</HI> and Torture, any that the mo&s;t ingenious Malice cou'd contrive, and the mo&s;t en|raged Power inflict, <HI>rather than Sin.</HI> And the Chri|&s;tian Soldiers were the be&s;t Veterans, ever ready to obey their Emperors and Generals, while they cou'd keep a good Con&s;cience: But yet they had Courage eno', to let them know that they wou'd not obey them, when to do &s;o, might be con&s;trued Di&s;obedience to GOD. It was not all the Artifice of a &s;ubtle <HI>Julian,</HI> the Threat|nings of one Emperor, or the Promi&s;es of another, that cou'd &s;educe 'em from their Allegiance to their chief Captain, the <HI>Lord of Ho&s;ts</HI>: They nobly an&s;wer'd 'em in &s;uch Language as this; "You threaten us with Fire, unle&s;s we obey; but this la&s;ts but for an Hour: But

Becau&s;e thou ha&s;t made the</HI> LORD <HI>thy Habitation, he &s;hall give his Angels charge over thee.</HI> By this I mean not, that a good Man has any particular A&s;&s;urance, that he &s;hall not fall in the Heat of Battle; but that there is that general Encouragement in the divine Promi&s;es, which is &s;ufficient to animate him to the greate&s;t Hard|&s;hips and &s;harpe&s;t Conflicts. Accordingly you find the holy <HI>P&s;almist</HI> would not <HI>trust in his Sword, and in his Bow,</HI> but <HI>boa&s;ted in the Lord all the Day long.</HI> He often expre&s;&s;es the <HI>Boldne&s;s of Faith</HI> in &s;uch Language as this, <HI>Thou,</HI> LORD, <HI>art my Shield and Buckler, my Glory and the lifter up of my Head: I will not be afraid of Ten Thou&s;and of the People that have &s;et them&s;elves against me.</HI> No, <HI>The</HI> LORD <HI>is my Light and my Salva|tion, whom &s;hall I fear? GOD is our Refuge and Strength, a very pre&s;ent Help in Trouble; therefore will we not fear, though the Earth be removed, and though the Mountains be carried into the midst of the Sea, though the Waters thereof roar and be troubled, though the Mountains &s;hake with the &s;welling thereof.</HI></P>
<P>Once more,</P>
<P N="3">3. True Religion <HI>regulates</HI> our Courage. &mdash; 'Tis not &s;ufficient for a Soldier that he have Courage, unle&s;s it be under a due Regulation. Without this it cea&s;es to be virtuous, and differs as much from true Fortitude, as
<PB N="26" REF="005969_0024_10271900051141A8">
a Fla&s;h of Gun-powder from the glowing &s;teady Heat of a well-kindled Fire. Let the Succe&s;s of Courage be what it will, there is no other Prai&s;e to be given it, than what <HI>Seneca</HI> gives <HI>Alexander,</HI> when he &s;ays, <HI>pro Virtute erat felix Temeritas,</HI> the Succe&s;s of Ra&s;hne&s;s was his Virtue. But now 'tis the Glory of Religion, that it re|gulates Courage. &mdash; This it doth, (1^s^t) As to the <HI>Principle</HI> of military Actions. And here as the <HI>Grace of God teaches us to deny all Ungodline&s;s and worldly Lusts,</HI> &s;o doth it not &s;uffer us to draw the Sword, upon the Principles of Covetou&s;ne&s;s and Ambition. Tho&s;e therefore, who by a mi&s;placed Eloquence have been celebrated as the great Heroes of the World, Religion condemns as the great Murderers of it; ranking them among the Men who <HI>love Violence,</HI> and <HI>delight in War,</HI> the <HI>Men of Blood,</HI> whom GOD'<HI>s So<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">ateth.</HI> Religion allows us to defend our own Rights; but not to invade tho&s;e of others. It will ju&s;tify us in fighting for our Religion; but not in fighting again&s;t the Religion of others, tho' it be ever &s;o fal&s;e: In taking up the <HI>Cro&s;s</HI>; but no <HI>Cru&s;ades</HI>; this is Chri&s;tian, that Antichri&s;tian. An holy War, in the <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> Sen&s;e, is but a Ba&s;tard, begot by the Devil upon Lu&s;t and Cruelty. &mdash; Again, (2^d^l^y) Religion regulates our Courage as to its <HI>Exerci&s;e</HI>; teaching us when to &s;hun Dangers, and when to meet and encounter them. I am not in&s;en&s;ible indeed, that in the primitive Times many of the Chri&s;tians di&s;cover'd an irregular Courage: They &s;ometimes broke into Pri&s;on, when they would have &s;corn'd to break out of it: Sufferings and Death &s;eem'd to approach 'em with leaden Heels, and a &s;low Pace; and therefore they met 'em more than half Way; courted the burning Flames, and too earne&s;tly long'd for the Crown of Martyrdom. But this Irregularity was the Fault of the Chri&s;tians, not of Chri&s;tianity. The <HI>Captain of our Salvation</HI> has indeed bid us <HI>take up the Cro&s;s,</HI> but not to run after it: Far from this, he has commanded us, when <HI>per&s;ecuted in
<PB N="27" REF="005969_0025_102719019E859558">
one City,</HI> to <HI>flee to another</HI>; and when we can fly no farther, with a good Con&s;cience, then to &s;ubmit to tho&s;e Sufferings, which in Honour to Him we cannot avoid. Yes, there mu&s;t be a good Call, as well as a good Cau&s;e; or el&s;e our Sufferings are not ju&s;tifiable. We are not to &s;teal the Cro&s;s: If &s;o, what are we but Thieves upon it? In which Ca&s;e, how can we expect the Applau&s;e of our Lord? I mean not, my Brethren, to &s;peak a Word again&s;t the Courage and Zeal of the primitive Chri&s;tians, &s;o far as it was true: Would to GOD, that we might &s;ee primitive Chri&s;tianity reviv'd, and the Church re|turning to her <HI>first Love,</HI> and to <HI>the fir&s;t Works,</HI> from whence &s;he is fallen, in Degree, as far as &s;he is di&s;tant in Time: But yet doubtle&s;s there was not an exact Con|formity of Chri&s;tian Men to Chri&s;tian Principles, and wherein they were irregular, they are not to be imi|tated.&mdash; But I mu&s;t ha&s;ten more briefly to enquire,</P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>By what</HI> Means <HI>doth Chri&s;tianity befriend the Spirit of true Fortitude?</HI></P>
<P>Here, my Brethren, let me only point you to the Promi&s;es of the Go&s;pel, tho&s;e <HI>exceeding great and pre|cious Promi&s;es, which are given us, that by them we might be made Partakers of the Divine Nature.</HI> Our great Leader and Commander, though he has an ab&s;o|lute Right to the Obedience of his Soldiers, yet doth not bid 'em &s;erve him for nought; no, he has <HI>&s;et a Joy before them,</HI> enough to Reward all the Toil and Fatigue of the longe&s;t Life. We fight not for the Ap|plau&s;e of Men, the Acclamations of the People, which as they are often unju&s;tly be&s;towed, &s;o afford no pre&s;ent Satisfaction to the Mind, and then peri&s;h in a Moment: No, 'tis the Approbation of an holy GOD and Saviour, ecchoed from the golden Harps of Angels and Arch|angels, that animates and in&s;pires us. We fight not for Money, that will poorly pay for the Angui&s;h of broken Bones, &s;hatter'd Limbs, and mangled Bodies, which
<PB N="28" REF="005969_0026_10271903C5E425F0">
al&s;o are oftimes accompanied with wounded Con&s;ciences: But we have an Inheritance before us large as our Wi&s;hes, and long as our Duration, or the Duration of GOD him|&s;elf; an Inheritance, not to comfort us under Pain, but which eternally frees from it. &mdash; We fight not for a <HI>corruptible Crown,</HI> peri&s;hing Laurels; but for a <HI>Crown of Righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> a <HI>Crown of Life,</HI> a Crown who&s;e Glory &s;hall never fade away. Yes, if we <HI>&s;uffer with</HI> CHRIST, it is that we al&s;o may be <HI>glorified together.</HI> We have the Word and Honour of CHRIST, <HI>To him that overcometh, will I grant to &s;it with me in my Throne, even as I al&s;o overcame and am &s;et down with my Father in his Throne.</HI> Revel. 3.21. Such is the Chri&s;tian's Encouragement: and 'tis the manifold Grace of the Divine Spirit, fa&s;tning upon, embracing of, and delighting in this Encouragement, that excites the mar|tial Spirit, in&s;pires with the be&s;t Fortitude, fits the Chri&s;tian for and urges him on to the bolde&s;t Atchieve|ments. Faith &s;ees the Promi&s;es with a &s;trong Eye: Yes, <HI>Faith is the Sub&s;tance of Things hoped for, and the Evidence of Things not &s;een.</HI> Love embraces them with a vigorous Arm; and Hope has a firm Expectation of the promis'd Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s. In the Exerci&s;e of the&s;e Graces the Saints have &s;ometimes <HI>e&s;caped the Edge of the Sword</HI>; and &s;ometimes drawn it, to the <HI>&s;ubduing of Kingdoms</HI>: Even the <HI>Weak</HI> have been made <HI>&s;trong,</HI> and the Strong become Victorious, <HI>waxing Valiant in Fight,</HI> and <HI>turn|ing to Flight the Armies of the Aliens.</HI> At other Times, when GOD called 'em to &s;uffer, the <HI>Spirit of God and of Glory re&s;ted upon 'em</HI>; they had <HI>Trial of cruel Mockings, Scourgings, Bonds, and Impri&s;onments,</HI> were <HI>de&s;titute, afflicted, tormented</HI>; and yet &s;uperiour to all their Suf|ferings, Triumphant in and over them.</P>
<P>But I am &s;en&s;ible, 'tis Time to draw towards a Con|clu&s;ion. And with regard to the Congregation in ge|neral, allow me to apply the Words of the Preacher,
<PB N="29" REF="005969_0027_10271908C3F08798">
<HI>Let us hear the Conclu&s;ion of the whole Matter; Fear GOD, and keep his Commandments; for this is the whole of Man.</HI> This is his whole Duty, this is the Way to his entire and eternal Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s. This &s;ecures Peace with GOD, thro' JESUS CHRIST, and Peace with our own Con&s;cience, under the &s;prinkling of a Saviour's Blood: This e&s;tabli&s;hes Peace with others, where 'tis enjoyed; and obtaining it, where it is wanted. <HI>Our Peace &s;hall</HI> then <HI>be as a River, and our Righteou&s;ne&s;s as the Waves of the Sea.</HI> Or if others war again&s;t us, it will procure Victory over them: So GOD him&s;elf in|timates in that Language, <HI>O that my People had heark|ned to me, and</HI> I&s;rael <HI>had walked in my Ways!

<P>GENTLEMEN,</P>
<P>'Tis ju&s;tly e&s;teem'd an In&s;tance of <HI>Spartan</HI> Wi&s;dom in our excellent Forefathers, who in&s;tituted your Order, form'd your Company, and gave you a Charter, con|taining &s;pecial Rights and Priviledges. Their De&s;ign in di&s;tingui&s;hing you, doubtle&s;s was, that you might di&s;|tingui&s;h your &s;elves: not &s;o much by your Habit, as by your Skill; not &s;o much by your martial Arms, as by your martial Spirit; that from you, as from a River, the Streams of Skill and Valour might flow thro' all the Militia of the Land, gladning the Cities of our GOD in their Pro&s;pects of Defence.&mdash; And your De&s;ign in a&s;king the Prie&s;t to &s;ound the Trumpet, is, I tru&s;t; that by the Word or GOD and Prayer, your Arms may be

con&s;ecrated, your Courage &s;upported, regulated by For|titude, and &s;anctified by Grace. And truly, <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> Such Fortitude was never more nece&s;&s;ary, than at pre|&s;ent. Our Times are the Times of War: If we look abroad, we find Nation ri&s;ing up again&s;t Nation, and Kingdom again&s;t Kingdom. <HI>To Arms, To Arms,</HI> has been the horrid Cry, which has long re&s;ounded from Shore to Shore, and from one Nation to another: The Con&s;equences of which have been wounding to the Ear, and &s;hocking to the Eye. How many a di&s;tant Field, wherein &s;carce any Thing is to be heard, but the con|fu&s;ed Noi&s;e of Warriors, &s;ounding Drums, bur&s;ting Guns, hollow Moans, piteous Groans; and nothing to be &s;een but Smoke and Fire above, but Blood and Slaughter covering the Field below. And if we come nigher Home, we find our &s;elves incompa&s;s'd with Dan|ger, Enemys threatning us by Sea and a&s;&s;aulting us by Land. How much of our Sub&s;tance has been wa&s;ted! How many of our Lands vacated! How many of our Brethren of the Inland-Frontiers, are now mourning in Captivity! <HI>The Lord hear the Sighing of the Pri&s;oner!</HI> How many others are fallen by the Hands of an Ene|my, who&s;e tender Mercies are cruelty! And what Mul|titudes are yet carrying their Soul in their Hand; to &s;ecure their Sub&s;tance, are jeoparding their Lives! And &s;hould we extend our Pro&s;pects forward, may we not without a Spirit of Prophecy, venture to &s;ay, that un|le&s;s the Expedition again&s;t an envious and jealous Neigh|bour go on, coming Wars will produce another <HI>Flan|ders</HI> in <HI>America</HI>; that Army will be found contending with Army in our own Frontiers, and Multitudes of our own Children with their Garments roll'd in Blood! In &s;uch a Situation of Affairs, 'tis mournful to think, there is &s;o little of a martial Spirit to be found among us. Ah, Where is the Spirit of a <HI>Standi&s;h, Win&s;low, Church, March, Lovewell,</HI> and many others, who&s;e warlike Atchieve|ments in former Times have con&s;ecrated their Names,
<PB N="31" REF="005969_0029_1027190F2019AAA8">
and embalmed their Memories! What, did their Spi|rit die with them! and can there be no Re&s;urrection of it, e&s;pecially when the Government has &s;o nobly exerted it &s;elf herefor! Sure, the whole Di&s;pen&s;ation of Pro|vidence points us to the Nece&s;&s;ity of a martial Spirit. The Language of GOD at this Day is that; <HI>Wake up ye mighty Men, prepare the War, anoint the Shield, beat your Plow-&s;hears into Swords,</HI> and <HI>your Pruning-books into Spears, let the Weak &s;ay, I am &s;trong.</HI> But then, as we have heard, The martial Spirit mu&s;t be accompa|nied with the religious one. 'Tis the want of this, that has drawn the Sword of GOD, and bath'd it in the Blood of Men. Yes, verily the Nations warring with one another is a Proof that GOD is contending with them; and whoever con&s;iders the melancholy State of Religion, either at Home or abroad, will find no Rea&s;on to won|der, that <HI>GOD has whet his glittering Sword,</HI> and that <HI>his Hand hath taken hold on Judgment.</HI> Without this, I mean <HI>pure and undefiled Religion,</HI> we have nothing to expect, either from Skill or Valour. This then let me pre&s;s, in a Manner that &s;hall comprehend all Ranks and Orders of Men, but with a particular Eye to the Men of military Character. 'Tis not, <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> becau&s;e I que&s;tion your Courage, that I have addre&s;s'd you this Day from &s;uch a Text; but that I might be In&s;tru|mental of enobling it, by urging on you the Practice of Religion: This will put a Glory on your Courage, and give you Confidence of Succe&s;s. Here I &s;hall mention but two Words of Command; both of which comes from your great Leader, even Him of whom the Father by a Voice from Heaven has &s;aid, <HI>This is my beloved Son, hear Him.</HI></P>
<P>In the 1^s^t Place then, <HI>Take up the Cro&s;s.</HI> Let none think this a Duty incumbent only on the primitive Chri&s;tians, that were expos'd to Per&s;ecution from the Civil Magi&s;trate, who hated their Religion, though
<PB N="32" REF="005969_0030_10271912EB6D8DC0">
without a Cau&s;e. No, This is a Duty that runs par|rallel with Chri&s;tianity, and remains in its binding Force and Power till CHRIST &s;hall come with his Crown. 'Tis not, I grant, every Cro&s;s that a Man bears which will denominate the Obedience CHRIST demands, or intitle to the Reward he promi&s;es. Mo&s;t Men make Cro&s;&s;es for them&s;elves; in which Ca&s;e they are Martyrs only to their own Folly. 'Tis well worthy our Ob&s;er|vation, that what is expre&s;s'd in one Evangeli&s;t by <HI>taking up the Cro&s;s,</HI> is interpreted by another, by taking up <HI>his</HI> Cro&s;s. <HI>Di&s;tinguit Crucem</HI> (&s;ays <HI>Aretius) hac Voc&ecirc;</HI>; &s;uam <HI>non Alienam Crucem affectare debemus.</HI> Yes, every Man has <HI>his</HI> Cro&s;s; and Chri&s;tianity obliges him to take it up.</P>
<P>This intends, <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> The <HI>battl'ing</HI> with and <HI>&s;ubduing</HI> of tho&s;e <HI>Enemies</HI> that oppo&s;e the De&s;igns of the <HI>Cro&s;s of</HI> CHRIST. The Chri&s;tian Life is a Warfare; every Chri&s;tian, a Soldier by Profe&s;&s;ion. At Bapti&s;m, he enters his Name in CHRIST's Mu&s;ter-Roll: And whenever he receives the other Sacrament, he takes an Oath of Allegiance and Fidelity to CHRIST, his Captain and his King. Now the Idea of a Soldier &s;uppo&s;es Enemies: And the De|&s;ign of his Profe&s;&s;ion is to conquer and de&s;troy 'em. Agreably, this is our Ca&s;e; the gracious De&s;ign of CHRIST is to train us up by the Exerci&s;es of Holine&s;s, for the Enjoyment of Him&s;elf in Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s. But alas, How many Enemies oppo&s;e this De&s;ign; &s;ome Spiri|tual, &s;ome Carnal; rank'd under various Heads, and Potentates; <HI>the Lu&s;t of the Eye, the Lu&s;t of the Fle&s;h, and the Pride of Life!</HI> The&s;e are dangerous Enemies; and the more &s;o, for pretending Friend&s;hip to us. They appear delicate as <HI>Agag,</HI> that we are loth to annoy 'em; and then they are akin to us, born and bred up with us, and by long Acquaintance and mutual Indulgences, they are as a <HI>right Hand,</HI> or a <HI>right Eye.</HI> Now to op|po&s;e the&s;e Enemies, to conquer and &s;ubdue 'em, this is like <HI>cutting off</HI> the right Hand, the working, u&s;eful,
<PB N="33" REF="005969_0031_102719148545F1F0">
honourable Hand; yea, 'tis like <HI>plucking out</HI> the right Eye, which requires great Self-denial, and puts to much Pain. This is killing, crucifying Work; but yet ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary. Hence that of the Apo&s;tle; <HI>Mortify your Members which are upon the Earth, Fornication, Un|cleanne&s;s, inordinate Affection, evil Concupi&s;cence, and Covetou&s;ne&s;s, which is Idolatry; for which Things &s;ake the Wrath of GOD, cometh on the Children of Di&s;o|bedience,</HI> (Colo&s;. 3.5, 6.) In Compliance with which, the true Chri&s;tian, like his Ma&s;ter, is a crucified Man: Accordingly the Apo&s;tle &s;ays, <HI>I am crucified with</HI> CHRIST; and gives this as the Character of every true Chri&s;tian, <HI>They that are</HI> CHRIST<HI>'s have crucified the Fle&s;h,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Again, <HI>&s;econdly,</HI> Taking up the Cro&s;s, implys a <HI>pa|tient Submi&s;&s;ion</HI> to tho&s;e <HI>&s;orrowful Things,</HI> which we re|ceieve at the Hand of GOD; and a <HI>cheerful Acceptance</HI> of tho&s;e Sufferings and Per&s;ecutions, which he permits the Malice or Wickedne&s;s of <HI>Men</HI> to bring upon us:&mdash; In all the Afflictions which come from the Hand of GOD, &s;aying, <HI>The Cup which my heavenly Father has prepa|red for me, &s;hall I not take it,</HI> tho' it be with a trem|bling Hand! <HI>Shall I not drink it,</HI> tho' with an aking Heart! <HI>Father, not as I will, but as thou wilt.</HI>&mdash; There are other Troubles proceeding from <HI>Men,</HI> and the&s;e are di&s;tingui&s;h'd into tho&s;e which re&s;ult from the Pride or Envy, Malice or Ill-Nature of others, in re&s;pect of our <HI>Per&s;ons,</HI> and tho&s;e which are brought upon us on Account of <HI>Religion.</HI> In the former Ca&s;e, we are <HI>in Patience</HI> to <HI>po&s;&s;e&s;s our Souls</HI>; while that is the Language of our Mouths, <HI>Let</HI> Shimei <HI>Cur&s;e</HI>:&mdash; In the latter, not mere Patience, but Cheerfulne&s;s and Joy becomes us. So the Command of CHRIST, <HI>When they &s;hall revile you, and &s;ay all manner of Evil again&s;t you fal&s;ly for my &s;ake, rejoice and be exceeding glad.</HI> Accordingly we find the Saints &s;inging in a Pri&s;on, <HI>rejoycing that they were coun|ted worthy to &s;uffer Shame for the Name of</HI> CHRIST, and <HI>to fill up that which was behind of his Sufferings.</HI></P>

I &s;ay, the mo&s;t neglected: Were any Man to a&s;k, What was the Sin reigning in an e&s;pecial Manner among Per&s;ons of every Denomination, it might ju&s;tly be an&s;wered, <HI>Un|watchfulne&s;s.</HI> To this is owing the Decay of Godline&s;s in &s;ome, and the Want of it in others.

This Duty, neverthele&s;s, is peculiarly advantageous; it di&s;covers our Danger, and thereby le&s;&s;ens it; calls forth the Graces of the Divine Spirit into lively Exerci&s;e, animates to Duty, and is the Life of it, gives us the mo&s;t joyful Reflections upon it, and the plea&s;ing Pro&s;|pects of and longing for the glorious Appearance of the great GOD and our Saviour JESUS CHRIST.&mdash; But then this Duty is very exten&s;ive, peculiarly &s;o: As to the other Duties of the Chri&s;tian Life, one is nece&s;&s;ary at one Time, another at another; but Watchfulne&s;s reaches to every Duty, in all Times and Places: It im|bo&s;oms all other Duties, as the Air doth the Earth; and as all Things on the Earth would die, were it not for the Air that &s;urrounds them, &s;o would every Duty be a mere Carca&s;s, and a very offen&s;ive one, were it not for Watchfulne&s;s; which (by keeping the Heart, and looking unto JESUS) enlivens, &s;trengthens, &s;ancti|fies, and perfumes it. Watchfulne&s;s, 'tis broad as the Law of GOD, and that is exceeding broad; long as the Chri&s;tian's Life, how far &s;oever extended; deep as Hell in all its Temptations; and high as Heaven, whence it looks for the Saviour the Lord JESUS CHRIST, to come with his Reward. &mdash; Very briefly here I would &s;ay,</P>

<P>Again, Watch over your <HI>Words. &mdash; Life and Death</HI> (&s;ays <HI>Solomon) are in the Power of the Tongue.</HI> Sure then we &s;hould &s;et a Watch at the Door of our Lips; &s;aying with the P&s;almi&s;t, <HI>I am purpo&s;ed that my Mouth &s;hall not tran&s;gre&s;s.</HI> The Want of Watchfulne&s;s here has

&s;et many a Tongue on Fire of Hell, rais'd the greate&s;t Fires on Earth, and inkindled the Wrath of Heaven. Soldiers have an e&s;pecial need of a Watch here, &s;ince Profanene&s;s has &s;o greatly troubled the Camp of GOD.</P>
<P>Again, Watch over the <HI>Sen&s;es</HI> of your <HI>Body.</HI> With|out a Watch here, you will be in Danger of being be|trayed into the the Love of Ea&s;e and Plea&s;ure, Intem|perance, and all Sen&s;uality.</P>
<P>Again, Watch over the <HI>Frame</HI> of your <HI>Spirit.</HI> This will guard you again&s;t all indecent Heats, &s;our Di&s;con|tent, Mutiny, Rebellion; will teach the Officer to com|mand, and the private Centinel to obey; and all how to behave under a Defeat, on one Hand, or Victory on the other; and to acknowledge GOD in all. So <HI>Henry</HI> the 5th of noble Memory, when he defeated the <HI>French</HI> Army at <HI>Agincourt,</HI> twelve Times more numerous than his own, prepared for the Battle by fervent Prayer, and &s;anctified the Conque&s;t by exalted Prai&s;e; triumphing more in the Favour of GOD, than in all the Spoils of his Enemy. &mdash; But I mu&s;t not proceed, &mdash; I am aware, that the&s;e Directions extend to Chri&s;tians in general, and may be u&s;eful to Men of all Denomina|tions:&mdash; And therefore <HI>what I &s;ay</HI> to the Company of Artillery, <HI>I &s;ay to all, Watch.</HI> Yea, you will ea&s;ily &s;ee that they have a &s;pecial Reference to the Soldiers, to whom they will in the Application be peculiarly u&s;eful.</P>
<P>But to conclude all, and that I may animate every one to the &s;piritual Warfare, Let me try you with the Authority of CHRIST. Yes, <HI>He is thy Lord,</HI> and there|fore <HI>wor&s;hip thou Him</HI>; thy <HI>Leader,</HI> who &s;ays, <HI>Follow Me.</HI> &mdash; Again, Shall I point you to the Example of CHRIST? <HI>He has left you an Example, that you &s;hould follow his Steps</HI>; has led you on to Battle, fought a good Fight, encountred and de&s;troyed every

Enemy: <HI>Look</HI> then <HI>to</HI> JESUS, <HI>who for the Joy that was &s;et before him, endured the Cro&s;s, and de&s;pi&s;ed the Shame.</HI> &mdash; Again, Shall I mind you, that as Chri&s;|tians, you are profe&s;&s;ed Soldiers, and have obliged your &s;elves to <HI>endure Hardne&s;s as good Soldiers of</HI> JESUS CHRIST. &mdash; Again, Shall I tell you, that a <HI>Cloud of Witne&s;&s;es</HI> ob&s;erve you, how you fight, or how you fly, conquer or yeild; and Record your whole Beha|viour in the Annals of Heaven? &mdash; Again, Shall I tell you, that there is &s;ufficient Strength provided for and offer'd to you? Yes, JESUS is <HI>your Strength,</HI> as well as <HI>your Redeemer,</HI> and through Him you may do Valiantly. &mdash; Again, Shall I &s;ay, that <HI>Nece&s;&s;ity is laid upon you?</HI> There is <HI>no Di&s;charge in this</HI> &s;piritual <HI>War</HI>: Fight you mu&s;t, or die; and that not only the fir&s;t, but the <HI>&s;econd Death,</HI> even that which con&s;i&s;ts in a <HI>Lake that burneth with Fire and Brim&s;tone.</HI> Brave and Valiant as you are in your Conflicts with temporal Enemies, yet neglecting your &s;piritual ones, you will hereafter appear Cowards indeed; you will fly <HI>from the Face of Him that &s;itteth on the Throne, and from the Wrath of the Lamb,</HI> cry to the <HI>Rocks</HI> to <HI>fall upon you,</HI> and <HI>the Mountains</HI> to <HI>cover you</HI>; but yet cry in vain, to Creatures as deaf to you, as you were to GOD. The GOD which you defied is come out again&s;t you in Battle-Aray; but Oh! <HI>Who can abide the Day of his Anger! Hast thou,</HI> O Man, <HI>an Arm like GOD?</HI> Or, <HI>Canst thou Thunder with a Voice like His?</HI> How will thou meet an armed GOD, Almighty Vengeance lowring on his Brow, and his Hand taking hold on Judgment? Where will be thy Courage, O Man, while the Sentence of Mi&s;ery thunders from the Mouth of thy Judge? Or where, &mdash; when the Execution of it comes on, and thou finde&s;t thy&s;elf <HI>going down to Hell, with thy Weapons of War,</HI> as the Prophet expre&s;&s;es it! On the other Hand, for thy Encouragement, con&s;ider, that having been <HI>faithful</HI> to thy Leader JESUS
