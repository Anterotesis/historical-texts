<P>AN ESSAY ON FREE TRADE and FINANCES, &amp;c.</P>
<P>_FREEDOM of trade, or unre&s;train'd liberty of the &s;ubject to hold or di&s;po&s;e of his property as he plea&s;es, is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to the pro&s;perty of every com|munity, and to the happine&s;s of all individuals who compo&s;e it; this liberty will produce the following effects:</P>
<P>FIRST. Every indu&s;trious man will procure all the goods he can for &s;ale; this is the way to get mo&s;t money; and gain is the &s;oul of indu&s;try, the hope of reward &s;weetens labour, and the mo&s;t righteous have re&s;pect to the recompence of reward.</P>
<P>SECOND. Everyman will make his goods for market of the be&s;t quality he can, becau&s;e they will bring more money and quicker &s;ale than goods of mean quality.</P>
<P>THIRD. Every man will endeavour to carry to market the mo&s;t &s;carce goods, becau&s;e there is the greate&s;t demand and be&s;t price for them. All experience &s;hews, that the mo&s;t effectual way to turn a &s;carcity into a plenty, is to rai&s;e the price of the ar|ticles waited: Witne&s;s, among other in&s;tances, the mo&s;t alarm|ing &s;carcity of &s;altpetre and gunpowder, in the beginning of the pre&s;ent war, &s;ucceeded by the mo&s;t abundant plenty in le&s;s than one year, effected altogether by the high price and premiums &s;et on them.</P>
<P>FOURTH. Every men will go to market and return in good hu|mour and full &s;atisfaction, even tho' he may be di&s;appointed of the high price he expected, becau&s;e he has had the full chance of the market, and can blame nobody; and &s;hould be indulge fret|ting
<PB N="6" REF="016670_0004_0F9D769EEBAF0B60">
on the occa&s;ion, he would be the more ridiculed, and le&s;s pitied by his neighbours: And good humour and &s;atisfaction contribute not a little to the happine&s;s and pro&s;perity of commu|nities as well as individuals, and therefore this is an article by no means to be left out or overlooked in the admini&s;tration of either public or private oeconomy.</P>
<P>FIFTH. In times of danger, di&s;tre&s;s, and difficulty, every man will u&s;e &s;trong endeavours to get his goods to market, in pro|portion to the nece&s;&s;ity and great demand for them; becau&s;e they will then bring the be&s;t price, and every man is fond of em|bracing golden opportunities and favourable chances.</P>
<P>SIXTH. When things grow &s;carce and dear, every man will u&s;e them with the be&s;t oeconomy, and make the &s;tock on hand go as far and la&s;t as, long as po&s;&s;ible; or if he is de&s;titute, will buy as little as will ju&s;t &s;erve his nece&s;&s;ity. This naturally pre&s;erves the &s;tock on hand from needle&s;s profu&s;ion and wa&s;te, and converts it to the be&s;t and mo&s;t prudent u&s;e for the benefit of the community, and naturally tends to ward off high di&s;re&s;s or total want, till the high price and great demand, by their natural operation, will bring further &s;upplies to market.</P>
<P>SEVENTH. In times of &s;carcity, every man will have &s;trong in|ducements to bring all he can &s;pare to market, becau&s;e it will then bring the highe&s;t price he can even expect, and con&s;equently the community will have the benefit of all that exi&s;ts among them, in a much &s;afer manner than any degree of force could extort it, and all to the intire &s;atisfaction of buyer and &s;eller, by which the numberle&s;s feuds, riots, re&s;entment, and mi&s;chiefs which u&s;sually attend forced markets, would be intirely avoided; and the market be &s;upplied with all there is to be had. For no principle can draw into market, all the &s;upplies which are attainable, &s;o ef|fectually, as the chearful good-will and intere&s;t of the owners.</P>
<P>EIGHT. In times &s;carcity. When all the goods that are to be had, are expo&s;ed to &s;ale, its not po&s;&s;ible the prices &s;hould ex|ceed the degree of &s;carcity, for when the prices ri&s;e very high, they will &s;oon determine whether the &s;carcity is real or not; for if not real, the high price will bring &s;uch quantity to market as will &s;oon lower the price; but if real, 'tis nece&s;&s;ary for the above rea|&s;ons, that the prices &s;hould continue high 'till &s;upplies are produced.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="016670_0005_0F9D769FAF46E7C0">RESTRAINT of property or limitation of prices will hurt any community, and will probably produce the following effects, con|trary to the above.</P>
<P>FIRST. Every man will have as little to do with the market, and bring as few goods there as he can; for the le&s;s goods he has for &s;ale, the le&s;s mortification and lo&s;s he &s;u&s;tains.</P>
<P>SECOND. Every man will make his goods for market of a bad quality, or at lea&s;t not the be&s;t; for they mu&s;t all go at the limited price, and he therefore gets nothing for any &s;pecial care or &s;kill, he may be&s;tow on his goods to meliorate or perfect their quality; for the &s;ame rea&s;on, every man will expo&s;e his wor&s;t goods to market, and keep the be&s;t out of &s;ight, for example, mu&s;ty Tea, &s;tale Flour, black heavy Bread, &amp;c.</P>
<P>THIRD. Every man is induced to keep &s;uch goods as are mo&s;t &s;carce from market; for if he carries them there, he can get no more than the limited price, and &s;tands a chance of a bad hu&s;tling in the croud into the bargain. Whereas, if he can keep his goods from market, the &s;carcity will &s;oon force a great price, and he has a chance of great profits.</P>
<P>FOURTH. If prices are limited, and the owner is compelled to &s;ell at the prices limited; he con&s;iders him&s;elf injured by every &s;ale he makes for le&s;s than he &s;uppo&s;es he could have obtained in a free market, that his liberty is taken from him, and he can no longer call his property his own. The&s;e are hard feelings to one born to freedom almo&s;t perfect, and rai&s;ed to the expectations of enjoy|ing it in future time, in its highe&s;t perfection. The&s;e feelings fill the mind with anxiety and re&s;entment, and when in&s;tances of this become numerous among the merchants, trade&s;men and far|mers, &s;mall accidents may blow up the concealed coal, and mo&s;t fetal effects may ea&s;ily be &s;uppo&s;ed to en&s;ue. This is a danger of no &s;mall magnitude, for the real &s;trength and e&s;tabli&s;hment of every government con&s;i&s;ts in the hearty union and &s;atisfaction of the in|dividuals that compo&s;e it.</P>
<P>FIFTH. In times of danger, di&s;tre&s;s, and difficulty; no man will be induced to any great efforts, to &s;upply the market, for an additional danger makes an additional expence upon the goods;
<PB N="8" REF="016670_0006_0F9D76A06617F7E8">
but he mu&s;t take the limited price and no more; he will not con|&s;equently combat and ri&s;k an increa&s;e of danger and expence without any chance of compen&s;ation.</P>
<P>SIXTH. When things grow &s;carce, every man will endeavour to lay in great &s;tores, if he can do it, without an increa&s;e of price, and will not think it nece&s;&s;ary to retrench his expences, whil&s;t he thinks his &s;tock will la&s;t through the &s;carcity ; the con&s;equence of which is, that all the &s;carce articles at market will be &s;crambled up by a few hands, who will have no inducement to par&s;imony in the expenditure of them, by which the &s;carcity and di&s;tre&s;s is increa&s;ed, and many mu&s;t be wholly de&s;titute; and as far as this re&s;pects the nece&s;&s;aries of life, the con&s;equences mu&s;t be dreadful.</P>
<P>EIGHTH. Add to the above, that in times of &s;carcity and great demand, every man who can po&s;&s;ibly conceal his goods will be|tempted to do it, in expectation that the great demand will &s;oon break through the unnatural re&s;traint of the limitation, and he &s;hall be able to obtain a great profit in the future &s;ale; and in &s;pight of all the vigilance and force that can be u&s;ed, many will be able to do this, which I take to be one of the natural effects of any unnatural re&s;traint of trade, which cannot be avoided.</P>
<P>NINTH. Add to all the&s;e the difficulties which mu&s;t attend the execution of &s;uch an act of limitation, may perhaps furni&s;h not the lea&s;t objection to it. Mu&s;t the owner be obliged to &s;ell to every per&s;orn who applies to purcha&s;e, without knowing whether he wants for u&s;e or &s;ale? Mu&s;t he forgo previous engagements of his goods in favour of the pre&s;ent demandant? Mu&s;t he be obliged so &s;ell to every knave and litigious fellow, with whom he would not chu&s;e to be at all concern'd in any dealing? Who &s;hall judge how much he may re&s;erve for his own u&s;e, and whether he may give corn to his cattle and hogs, and how much and how many of each he may keep, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. Mu&s;t he have his hou&s;e &s;earched from top to bottom for concealments? Even the lodging-rooms of his wife and daughters! I mu&s;t beg to be excu&s;ed from any further de&s;cription of the&s;e horrors, which too many know are not mero creatures of the imagination.</P>
<P>TENTH. It is not po&s;&s;ible to form a limitation of prices which &s;hall be ju&s;t, and therefore the whole &s;cheme nece&s;&s;arily implies inju&s;|tice.
<PB N="9" REF="016670_0007_0F9D76A136B27CB8">
The principles on which the ju&s;t prices of goods are fixed, are in a con&s;tant &s;tate of fluctuation, and therefore the prices mu&s;t ri&s;e and fall with their cau&s;es; all experience proves this, and it holds true in the mo&s;t exce&s;&s;ive degree, in times of &s;uch public di&s;tre&s;s and convul&s;ion as we now experience. And as it is much &s;afer to bind a man in health than a man in convul&s;ions, &s;o it will be &s;afer to limit trade in peaceable than convul&s;ed times. 'Tis not more ab&s;urd to limit the preci&s;e height, to which a &s;hip &s;hall be fixed at a whalf, where the tide is con&s;tantly ebbing and flowing. A great force will be requi&s;ite to keep the &s;hip from ri&s;ing or falling with the tide, and a mighty little u&s;e to pay for the trouble; be|&s;ides the probability of very e&s;&s;ential damage which the &s;hip mu&s;t incur by the application of the nece&s;&s;ary force; but indi&s;creet as this would be judged, it is le&s;s dangerous in a calm than in a &s;tormy &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>ELEVENTH. Another mi&s;chevious con&s;equence of this fatal mea|&s;ure and not the lea&s;t I conceive to be its unhappy tendency to corrupt the morals and integrity of the people. To e&s;cape the ruinous con&s;equences of loo&s;ing all, they are in a manner compelled; but to &s;ay the lea&s;t, they have very &s;trong temptation to avoid them, either by downright lying, or u&s;ing little arts, &s;hifts, and cheats, to avoid the &s;ale of their goods to di&s;advantage, it na|turally brings them into the habit, and gives them a facility of inventing and practi&s;ing low methods of &s;hamming Abraham, which they never would otherwi&s;e have thought of, and which 'tis infinitely detrimental to the public, they ever &s;hould learn; in&s;tances of this &s;ort might be enumerated without end. But 'tis needle&s;s to give examples, 'twere better they and their cau&s;es &s;hould be removed, than that they &s;hould be repeated. But after all, 'tis &s;aid that a limitation of prices is nece&s;&s;ary to appreciate the currency and &s;upply the army. Two very great objects in|deed: I will attend to both.</P>
<P>FIRST. I don't conceive that a limitation of prices can po&s;&s;ibly appreciate the currency or prevent a further depreciation.</P>
<P>FIRST. The value of money is nothing in it&s;elf, 'tis a mere rela|tion, tis the proportion between the medium of trade and the objects of trade; the&s;e two will always be in baliance: Therefore, if the medium of trade be increa&s;ed, whil&s;t the objects of trade continue the &s;ame, the money mu&s;t depreciate; if the medium
<PB N="10" REF="016670_0008_0F9D76A1E2DDFEB0">
of trade increa&s;e, and the objects of trade decrea&s;e, the proportion will alter fa&s;t, and the depreciation will increa&s;e in a double pro|portion, which I take to be the ca&s;e at pre&s;ent. Money will therefore increa&s;e or decrea&s;e its value according to the increa&s;e or decrea&s;e of its quantity, and the increa&s;e or decrea&s;e of the quan|tity of goods, or the objects of trade. This principle is grounded on the nature of the thing and can never be altered, and con&s;e|quently any attempt to oppo&s;e it mu&s;t be equally vain, as oppo|&s;ing any other law of nature whatever: It follows from this, that nothing can ever appreciate the money but le&s;&s;ening its quantity, or increa&s;ing the quantity of goods or objects of trade, and all at|tempts to do this in any other method, will prove vain and fruit|le&s;s in the end.</P>
<P>SECOND. It follows, that the price that any article of trade will bring in a free open market, is the only mea&s;ure of the value of that article at that time, and if this is warped from the truth, by any artifices of the merchant or force of power, it cannot hold; but the error will &s;oon di&s;cover it&s;elf, and the correction of it will be compelled by the irre&s;i&s;table force of natural principles, i.e. 'tis not po&s;&s;ible for merchants to rai&s;e goods too high, or the force of power to depre&s;s them too low, and make them keep &s;o. Both the&s;e may be done for a &s;hort time, but neither can la&s;t long.</P>
<P>THIRD. It follows that any limitation of prices, however &s;trongly inforced, if below the rates required by this great natural proportion, is but temporary inju&s;tice, can't be of long continuance, will tend daily to le&s;&s;en the quantity of goods in market, and &s;o will increa&s;e the mi&s;chief it was de&s;igned to prevent, and bring with it a large train of evils be&s;ides, which will require much time and wi&s;dom to remedy, and many that will be utterly re|medile&s;s, examples of which are obvious.</P>
<P>FOURTH. Money is made only for a medium of trade, and mu&s;t be kept in circulation and u&s;e or it peri&s;hes; for to &s;top the circu|lation of money and to kill it is the &s;ame thing, &s;top its cour&s;e and it dies, give it circulation again and it revives, or comes to life again; therefore, the price of goods for &s;ale, or objects of trade (i.e, every thing for which money is paid) mu&s;t always be &s;o high, as to require all the money there is to purcha&s;e them,
<PB N="11" REF="016670_0009_0F9D76A6E45DD080">
otherwi&s;e the &s;um remaining can't circulate, i.e. there will be no|thing to lay it out upon, and &s;o the owner mu&s;t keep it by him, dead and u&s;ele&s;s, &s;o that let what &s;ums of money &s;oever be in circula|tion, the objects of trade mu&s;t either increa&s;e in quantity, or ri&s;e in price &s;o high as to take all the money there is in circulation to purcha&s;e them, and as this natural law can't be re&s;trained, &s;o nei|ther can it be exceeded by any degree of artifice or force for any long time, for if the objects of trade ri&s;e &s;o high that all the mo|ney in circulation will not purcha&s;e them, the overplus mu&s;t re|main dead and un&s;aleable in the hands of the owner, which will &s;oon reduce the price; for goods which can't be &s;old, are as u&s;e|le&s;s in the hands of the merchant, as money which can't be cir|culated.</P>
<P>FIFTH. Every limitation of prices below the due proportion, checks the
Circulation of money, than which nothing can be more dangerous, when money is over plenty; his has been the con&s;tant effect of every limitation of prices which has been u&s;ed in Ame|rica. Bu&s;ine&s;s immediately &s;tagnates, goods can't be had, people can't purcha&s;e with their money the nece&s;&s;aries they want, they be|gin of cour&s;e to think that their money is good for nothing, and refu&s;e to take any more of it, and grow willing to part with what they have on hand at a depreciated value, &s;o that the certain ope|ration of a limitation of prices is a further depreciation of the money in&s;tead of the contrary. In&s;tead of this, 'tis of the la&s;t ne|ce&s;&s;ity in a plenty of money, that a free circulation be kept up, people will readily and even greedily take any money which they can readily pa&s;s again. And as long as this la&s;ts, there can be no danger of the money's &s;topping; whereas, the contrary chills it at once, and in a &s;hort time mu&s;t chill it into a Torpor, inca|pable of cure. Much in this ca&s;e depends on opinion, which is &s;oon formed by people in general, when they find they can't buy nece&s;&s;aries with their money. Specious rea&s;onings, warm har|rangues, declarations of Congre&s;s, or even the force of power o|perate little again&s;t this; 'tis a glaring intuitive proof of the badne&s;s of money, when it will not purcha&s;e nece&s;&s;aries, and as glaring and &s;trong a proof that 'tis good, when it will buy any thing in market. Hence appears the nece&s;&s;ity of keeping up a high and bri&s;k circulation of money, and the folly and danger of limitations, or any other mea&s;ures which prevent a circulation and
<PB N="12" REF="016670_0010_0F9D76A855FACCF0">
ob&s;truct trade: The&s;e are arguments grounded on plain fact, they have their foundation in the laws of nature, and no artifice or force of man can prevent, elude, or avoid their effects; their ope|ration is uncontrolable, and therefore I conceive all oppostion to them is the height of ab&s;urdity, and dangerous in the highe&s;t degree.&mdash;For ten months before the late limitations, we had a trade perfectly free, on which two ob&s;ervations are obvious.</P>
<P>FIRST. That any goods at market might be bought for Con|tinental money, the Speculators e&s;pecially (as they are called) were fond of receiving it, and no per&s;on could be at any lo&s;s for any thing at market, if he had that money to purcha&s;e the goods he needed.</P>
<P>SECOND. That imported goods on an average (which were the only articles Speculators dealt in) were 50 percent. cheaper on the 25th of May la&s;t, than on the 25th of of July preceding, i.e. any given quantity of imported goods would buy 50 per cent more articles of country produce or hard money, on the 25th of July, than on the 25th of May la&s;t; and for the truth of this, I refer to the merchants books, from which it follows that the Speculators (however numerous and however cen&s;ured) have not rai&s;ed the price of the goods they have principally dealt in:&mdash;Indeed all experience teaches, that the more hands the goods in market are held by, the cheaper they will be, and the more difficult to rai&s;e the price; and therefore, if the merchants ever think of rai&s;ing the price of any article, they never fail to &s;ay, We mu&s;t wait till the&s;e goods are drained out of the &s;mall &s;tores and get them into few hands. In July 25, 1778, price current of imported goods, at Philadelphia, was as follows, We&s;t-India rum 3l. 15s. Mu&s;co|vado &s;ugars 30l. mola&s;&s;es 40s. pepper 17s.6d. coffee 9s. cotton 15s. bohea tea 60s. Madeira wine 400l. dry goods about 8 to 1 old prices, and hard money 4 to 1, and price current of coun|try produce, was as follows, for Indian corn 15l. oats 12s. flour 60s, bar iron 200l. con&s;equently on July 25, 1778, one gallon We&s;t-India rum would bring 5 bu&s;hels of Indian corn, 6 bu&s;hels of oats, 1 &frac14; hundred flour, and &frac25; of a <HI>hundred of iron,</HI> or 18s. 9d. hard money, any body may ea&s;ily compare the re&s;t, and they will find enough to prove my a&s;&s;ertion with large allow|ance. Price current 25th May la&s;t was, rum 7l. &s;ugars 130l. iron
<PB N="13" REF="016670_0011_0F9D76A962E43488">
800l. tea 6l. 10s. &amp;c. Indian corn 7l. 10s. oats 90s. flour 30'. (hard money 20 to 1) and con&s;equently one gallon of rum would buy no more than one bu&s;hel Indian corn, 1&frac12; bu&s;hel of oats, 4 hun|dred flour, and &frac25; hundred iron or 7s. hard money, &amp;c. The&s;e com|putations are made in the face of the world, and grounded on facts which any body may di&s;approve, if they are not true, or correct the rea&s;oning, if it is not ju&s;t. Now I have only to add; let any body who is di&s;po&s;ed to &s;ee, open their eyes, and &s;ee who it is that has rai&s;ed our prices, or, <HI>which is the &s;ame thing,</HI> depreciated our money. Is it the Speculators who deal only in imported arti|cles? Or the farmers, among whom no kind of dangerous &s;pecu|lations does or can exi&s;t; perhaps it may be replied here, that the articles of country produce are extremely &s;carce, which rai&s;es their price beyound the due proportion of other things: If you &s;ay this, you &s;ay every thing and yield every thing, viz. that the plenty and &s;carcity of goods will govern the price. You mu&s;t admit too, that the plenty and &s;carcity of money will determine the value of that al&s;o. Why then will any one pretend to limit either, again&s;t the operation of this great principle. Tis ea&s;y in addition to all the&s;e to prove, that the price of imported articles in general does not exceed the value of them, if computed on the expence of ac|quirement: But this I mean only to hint, and wave it for the pre|&s;ent; and only wi&s;h &s;ome merchants of experience and reputation would take it up, and publi&s;h the needful e&s;&s;ay on it.</P>
<P>Nor do I think that the &s;cheme of loans can give e&s;tabli&s;hment to the currency, or prevent its depreciation.&mdash;For</P>
<P>FIRST. All loans increa&s;e the public debt, and the immen&s;ity of the &s;um is one cau&s;e of the depreciation, as it induces people to think it never will be paid, or the payment will nece&s;&s;arily be delayed to &s;uch a di&s;tant period, as in point of u&s;e to the pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, <HI>is nearly</HI> equal to total failure.</P>
<P>SECOND, If the credit of the Loan Office is well &s;upported (as it mu&s;t be to give it any good effect) the Loan-Office certificates them&s;elves will pa&s;s in payment, and &s;o become an addition to the currency which they are de&s;ign'd to le&s;&s;en.</P>
<P>THIRD. If foreign loans are negociated, and bills &s;old here, drawn on the loaned Bank in Europe, tho&s;e very bills will become a currency here, and &s;o add to the mi&s;chief.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="016670_0012_0F9D76A970B87538">FOURTH. The di&s;count on all European bills, is not le&s;s than 50 per cent, which lo&s;s mu&s;t immediately be &s;u&s;tained by the Conti|nent, on the fir&s;t &s;ale of them.</P>
<P>FIFTH. If hard money, borrowed in Europe, &s;hould be im|ported and &s;old here, the in&s;urance, which is more than 50 per cent, mu&s;t be left, nor can any man tell the mi&s;chief which would attend any attempt to import hard money, and open offices for the &s;ale of it for Continental bills; but a large group of the&s;e pre&s;ent them&s;elves too plainly to need enumeration.</P>
<P>SIXTH. Nor do I think the &s;cheme adopted by our Committee promi&s;es better &s;ucce&s;s for that propo&s;es. Loaning without induce|ment; and if it &s;hould &s;ucceed to the utmo&s;t expectation, it would drain the be&s;t friends to our cau&s;e of their money, whil&s;t our inter|nal enemies would pay nothing, for no compul&s;ion is propo&s;ed, and after all. It will be at be&s;t but an anticipation of the revenue, very dangerous in the end; for the very wor&s;t thing that can be done re&s;pecting a revenue, is to de&s;troy it all, principal and u&s;e, and the next wor&s;t thing is to anticipate it, i.e. to &s;pend this year the rent and proceeds which will become due and payable next year, and the&s;e two are &s;o connected, that the latter generally bring on the former &s;ooner or later. After all the&s;e objections to the various methods that have been propo&s;ed, it may be ex|pected that I &s;hould propo&s;e &s;ome method that will be practica|ble and effectual to fix the value of our currency, and this I cannot think very difficult, either in theory or practice, though I have not one new thought to offer the public on the &s;ubject. We are now on the brink of ruin, and the wor&s;t di&s;grace, in danger of lo&s;s of liberty hitherto nobly a&s;&s;erted, and &s;ubjection to &s;hame|ful &s;lavery, to enemies mo&s;t cruel and in&s;ulting in them&s;elves, and all that hightened in them to madne&s;s by the determined op|po&s;ition we have given to their &s;cheme of tyranny over us. All this danger ari&s;es not from our poverty or want, we have offi|cers and &s;oldiers enough, &s;tores of every kind enough, and zeal, union, and virtue &s;ufficient to in&s;ure &s;ucce&s;s; our difficulties ari&s;es only from our having too much money, and the le&s;&s;ening that quantity, would relieve us at once from every difficulty, and di&s;|cipate the thicke&s;t clouds that hang over us.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="016670_0013_0F9D76AAEF053B40">IN matters of difficulty and importance, all wi&s;e coun&s;ellors com|pare well the end and the means, on which two very weighty matters always pre&s;ent them&s;elves.</P>
<P>FIRST. Whether the means are &s;uffcient to &s;ecure and effect the end propo&s;ed.&mdash;And</P>
<P>SECOND. Whether the end is worth the means nece&s;&s;ary to ef|fect it. When the&s;e two points are &s;ettled, there remains no more room for con&s;ultation or debate, the re&s;t is all vigorous action, &s;trenuous exertion to put the means into &s;uch effectual exe|cution as to obtain the end. This is a wi&s;e method of planning, which no man will have any objection to. We will then adopt it in the con&s;ideration of the weighty &s;ubjct now in view.</P>
<P>FIRST. The end is fixing our currency and preventing any fu|ture depreciation, putting an effectual end to all the cheats, de|lu&s;ions, di&s;appointments, and ruinous lo&s;&s;es, which every one who has been concerned in it have hither to felt, and giving every one a &s;ure and well grounded confidence in it in future. This is an end, an object of &s;uch va&s;t, &s;uch weighty con&s;equence, and &s;o con&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed and acknowledged by all, that no arguments or illustra|tions are nece&s;&s;ary to be added here.</P>
<P>SECOND. The only means I conceive po&s;&s;ible to obtain this end, are to call in &s;uch &s;ums annually by taxes, as &s;hall be equal to the annual expenditures, this will prevent the increa&s;e of the money, will make a great demand for it though the Thirteen United States, will give it a bri&s;k circulation, will exhibit a mo&s;t convincing proof that it may be all called in and redeemed, and that it is the real de&s;ign of Congre&s;s to do this. Nothing helps the credit of a large debtor like making ample provi&s;ion for actual payments; he may promi&s;es till he is gray without this, and all in vain, the larger his promi&s;es the le&s;s are they credited, and the more ridiculous does he become: The cry again&s;t him is, Where is the money to come from? Let us &s;ee a &s;ample of it? but theory is altered when large payments are actually made, and &s;ufficient provi&s;ion making for the di&s;charge of the whole debt. Let people &s;ee the money collecting through the Continent, and the &s;ources of revenue actually opened, and the whole matter in train, there can then remain no doubt but the whole of the Continental money will be redeemed,
<PB N="16" REF="016670_0014_0F9D76ABA7D78A08">
and every one will venture to tru&s;t the credit of it, and in this con|fidence it will be &s;oon &s;ought after and gra&s;ped with greedine&s;s, and hugg'd and hoarded with avidity. This will put life into all our public mea&s;ures, civil and military, will give our government the command of the fulle&s;t &s;upplies of men, money, and &s;tores that are in the country, and that can be made or procured, will give &s;pirit to our people, will annimate indu&s;try, and will be a total cure of the mi&s;chiefs we now feel from the low credit of our currency. Here is an object highly worthy of our attention, as every one will admit without he&s;itation; the only thing then that remains, is whether it be practicable; I &s;uppo&s;e the outcry again&s;t it will be, that the people will not bear &s;uch enormous taxes, that they would &s;ink the poor and di&s;tre&s;s the rich far beyond what they will ever con&s;ent to bear, &amp;c. &amp;c. I conceive a vein of conver&s;ation of this &s;ort not at all founded in truth, for &s;everal rea&s;ons.</P>
<P>FIRST. 'Tis rare that the people refu&s;e burdens or ever grum|ble under them, when by general conviction, they are nece&s;&s;ary for the public good. And I dare &s;ay, that the ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of fixing and e&s;tabli&s;hing our currency is become obvious to al|mo&s;t every individual on this Continent, and the real necce&s;&s;ity of taxes for this purpo&s;e clearly &s;een by all.</P>
<P>SECOND. As far as my acquaintance with people of middling rank extends, they have been generally in favour of taxing for three years pa&s;t; they &s;ay this money mu&s;t be paid fir&s;t or la&s;t, and we can better pay it now whil&s;t we have little u&s;e for our mo|ney, whil&s;t it is plenty and ea&s;y to be got, than in future time, when we can perhaps not &s;o well &s;pare it, and when the getting it will be much more difficult.</P>
<P>THIRD. The enormity of the &s;um required for this purpo&s;e con|&s;i&s;ts much more in &s;ound than &s;ub&s;tance; a quarterly tax of one bu&s;hel of wheat, or two bu&s;hels of Indian corn per head, on all per&s;ons in the Thirteen States, would be amply &s;ufficient. The number of &s;ouls are computed at 3,000,000, in all the States, at lea&s;t, this would produce 12,000,000 bu&s;hels wheat, which at 20 dollars per bu&s;hel, (the lowe&s;t pre&s;ent price) will be 240,000,000 of dollars, a &s;um greatly exceeding any annual exigence of the&s;e States; each State might apportion this as they plea&s;ed, &s;o as to
<PB N="17" REF="016670_0015_0F9D76AC6D870398">
relieve the poor, and increa&s;e the &s;hare of the rich, but the mid|dling farmer who has ten in family, would have 40 bu&s;hels of wheat or its value, to pay in a year. I admit this would be a high tax; but is there any thing impo&s;&s;ible, or ruinous in this. In the be&s;t of times, it would have been 40 dollars, or 15l. and the &s;ame &s;um of hard money will probably now pay it, 'tis to be ob&s;erved this is not the tax of a post man or a new beginner, but of a middling farmer, with ten in family; &s;uch are &s;pread over the face of this fetile country, and few of them &s;o poor, that &s;uch a &s;um would di&s;tre&s;s them to any great degree. 'Tis to be ob&s;erved further this is not a tax to la&s;t always, but to be paid only for a &s;hort time, during our &s;trong exertions, for the liberty of our|&s;elves and our po&s;terity; again, this &s;um is not all to be paid at once, but at four quarterly payments; again, this is not a tax which demands wheat in kind, hard money, or any thing el&s;e that is &s;carce and hard to be obtained, but for continental money, which is fo plenty &s;o to become the great burden of the country, and the &s;ource of mo&s;t of our public calamities, and which any valuable com|modity will procure in plenty, and with little trouble; and for which any man may &s;ell any thing he can be&s;t &s;pare without difficulty; again, this is a fare method to overcome our capital difficulties and fix the currency. Whereas all others are precarious and uncertain in their effect. This is a durable, a fini&s;hed remedy; all others that have been propo&s;ed are at be&s;t but temporary, and &s;hould they &s;ucceed, would involve us and our po&s;terity in great difficulties. Involve us in a va&s;t debt, which would lie &s;o heavy on the country as would greatly check our future pro&s;perity and di&s;courage foreign|ers from coming to &s;attle with us. For no body likes to move into a country when taxes are very high and burden&s;ome. I &s;ubmit it to every man, whether it will not be much ea&s;ier for us by a &s;pirit|ed exertion, for a &s;hort time, to collect large &s;ums of our pre&s;ent currency, and pay our expences as fa&s;t as they ari&s;e, than if a foreign loan could be obtained, to pay a va&s;t debt of hard money with intere&s;t to foreigners in future time, when every dollar we pay, mu&s;t go out of the country never to return again. Every man ought to con&s;ider that this proportion of the public debt, is as much a debt fa&s;tened on his e&s;tate and become to all intents and purpo&s;es as much a burden and charge on it as any of his private debts the &s;ame amount, and mu&s;t as &s;urely one day be paid; is it not better then to pay it now than to have it lye a burthen on him, to
<PB N="18" REF="016670_0016_0F9D76AE985E76E0">
be paid in future time, which may be called for at &s;ome future time when he may not be in condition to pay it &s;o ea&s;y as now. Every prudent man does this with re&s;pect to his private debts, and what rea&s;on can be given why the &s;ame prudence &s;hould not extend to the debt, which he owes the public. Can any rea&s;on be a&s;&s;igned why the States &s;hould not imitate the prudence and oeconomy of a private man who happens to be involved for a time in great ex|penditures, which is to pay up and di&s;charge as much as po&s;&s;ible as he goes, and leave as little as po&s;&s;ible to be &s;ettled in future time. And to facilitate this, I humbly propo&s;e one thing more, viz. To take off every re&s;traint and limitation from our commerce. Let trade be as free as air. Let every man make the mo&s;t of his goods and in his own way, and then he will be &s;atisfied. Let every man ta&s;te and enjoy the &s;weets of that liberty of per&s;on and property, which was highly expected under an independent government. 'Tis a &s;ad omen to find among the fir&s;t efforts of independence, greater re&s;traints and abridgements of natural liberty than ever we felt under the government we have lately renounced and &s;haken off. Let the laws point out the duty, and be the bulwark of &s;e|curity of every man. Nothing gives the people &s;uch high &s;ati&s;|faction, with any &s;y&s;tem of government they live under, as the actual enjoyment of the ene&s;timable ble&s;&s;ings of perfect liberty and full &s;ecurity under it, this will mo&s;t effectually induce them chear|fully to &s;upport it. No burdens will be thought heavy, or dif|ficulties di&s;couraging, which the exigencies of government may require, when every man finds his own happine&s;s involved in the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the State; if on the freedom of trade, any ar|ticles &s;hould ri&s;e in their price, the mi&s;chief facilitates its own remedy. It makes the payment of the taxes more ea&s;y and tol|lerable. Whereas, if the taxes were collected during the limita|tion of the market and &s;tagnation of bu&s;ine&s;s, the payment would be extremly difficult, and the murmers high and rea&s;onable; it would be almo&s;t like the Egyptians demanding brick without &s;traw. But when the circulation of money is bri&s;k, and the price and de|mand for goods high, every one knows that money may be rai&s;ed and taxes may be paid much more ea&s;ily than in dull times of &s;tagnated bu&s;ine&s;s. And this ought to be noticed on another ac|count. 'Tis nece&s;&s;ary our fir&s;t taxes &s;hould be rendered as ea&s;y as po&s;&s;ible to the people; for though high in <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;um, if they had them ea&s;ily paid, the terror and unea&s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="4 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">hich high taxes

generally rai&s;e, will mo&s;tly vani&s;h, and the payment will be made without endangering the peace of the State, and the&s;e things all con&s;idered together naturally lead is to the free an&s;wer to the &s;e|cond great que&s;tion to be &s;olved.</P>
<P>SECOND. How is the army to be &s;upplied. The method I pro|po&s;e, if it can be adopted, will undoubtedly fix the currency and create a great demand for money, and a quick circulation of it, this will of cour&s;e open all the &s;tores in the State to any purcha|&s;ers that may offer, and a little prudence u&s;ed in purcha&s;ing, may &s;upply the army to the full, at rea&s;onable prices. Indeed I am rather I afraid of overdoing the thing in this way, &s;o far as to cau&s;e an ap|preciation of the money, which I don't think ought ever to be done, for I &s;ee no rea&s;on why the States &s;hould be taxed to rai&s;e the mo|ney in my pocket to twenty times the value it co&s;t me, but this is a great argument, and may be the &s;ubject of future di&s;cu&s;&s;ion. I mu&s;t add here that this method will not only fix our currency and &s;upport our army, but will afford another advantage of no &s;mall moment. It will take away the capital hope and a&s;&s;urance of our enemies of conquering us; for they depend more on the failure of our funds than on their own force, for this purpo&s;e, they count high on the quarrels, contention, oppre&s;&s;ions and mi&s;chiefs that will ari&s;e from the low &s;inking credit of our money: and by this are encouraged to continue the war, which they would relinqui&s;h as de&s;perate without it.</P>
<P>I WILL ju&s;t note here, that however intolerable the means I propo&s;e may appear at fir&s;t fight, I can't think them impractica|ble; the tax I propo&s;e is not more than two thirds of the annual taxes in Great-Britain, the whole revenue rai&s;ed every year there, is about 12,500,000 &s;terling, which is &s;omewhat more than 58,000,000 dollars, reckoning them at Four Shillings and Six|pence a piece; divide this by the number of fouls in Great-Britain, which are computed at 9,000,000, and we have the &s;um of &s;omewhat more than 6 dollars per head on each of the in|habitants, or living per&s;ons there; but, be this as it may, to balance the argument fairly, I think it &s;tands thus: On the one &s;ide certain de&s;truction, and on the other a tax &s;o heavy, that a middling farmer's &s;hare will be 40 bu&s;hels of wheat, 40 dollars hard money, or the value of it in any thing he cha&s;es to fell, ti
<PB N="20" REF="016670_0018_0F9D76B1DD301F48">
be paid annually, in four quarterly payments. This, if it can be done, will undoubtedly &s;ave us, re&s;tore our finances thorough|ly, fix our currency, and f&s;pply our army; without this, I don't &s;ee how the&s;e great objects can be effected. If any other method can be devi&s;ed, 'tis more than all the united wi&s;dom of America has yet been able to find and accompli&s;h, nor do I conceive we have any long time to he&s;itate, &s;omething &s;peedy and deci&s;ive mu&s;t avert our fate.</P>
<P>THUS I have offered my be&s;t thoughts freely to the public, and with mo&s;t upright intentions, I hope they may be received with candour. The facts and rea&s;onings are all open to the examina|tion of every one, if they do not convince, I hope at lea&s;t they may induce &s;ome abler per&s;on to &s;ketch out &s;omething more per|fect, and adequate to the great &s;ubject.</P>
