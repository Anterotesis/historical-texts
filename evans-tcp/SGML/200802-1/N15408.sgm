<HEAD>Cool Thoughts on the SUBJECT of the BANK. Addre&s;&s;ed to the Honorable the Repre&s;enta|tives of the Freemen of the Commonwealth of Penn&s;ylvania in General A&s;&s;embly.</HEAD>
<P>ALTHOUGH a great deal has been wrote on the &s;ubject of the Bank, which has engro&s;&s;ed much of the po|litics of the State, and no &s;mall &s;hare of the conver&s;ation of the town; and although an ho|norable Gentleman, who is a great &s;tockholder, and, therefore, very naturally, a great champion for the Bank in the Hou&s;e of A&s;&s;embly, has &s;aid, that he imagines "&s;ufficient light has been thrown upon the &s;ubject," yet I cannot help thinking that there is &s;till room to &s;ay &s;omething upon it, and that without going "the old ground over again."</P>
<P>It would be ungenerous, and unworthy the character of that Gentleman, to &s;uppo&s;e that he entertained a wi&s;h to &s;tifle any further enquiry, in order to bring the Members to an immediate deci&s;ion upon that &s;ubject. But as one of the
<PB N="2" REF="019583_0002_0FAC5BBEB586BA70">
writers in favor of the Bank has been candid enough to acknowledge, that "the <HI>directors</HI> were engaged in a bu&s;ine&s;s in which they had no experience (nothing of the kind having ever before been practi&s;ed in America) and though they acted with the greate&s;t con&s;idera|tion, care and caution po&s;&s;ible; yet all this not|with&s;tanding, 'tis hardly &s;uppo&s;able but &s;ome <HI>errors in management mu&s;t have been committed."</HI> I &s;ay, if this has been the ca&s;e, there is nothing pre&s;umptuous in &s;uppo&s;ing, that there may be &s;ome very worthy and reputable Members, who are very de&s;erving, and very well qualified to fill the &s;eat which they hold in that honorable Hou&s;e, who neverthele&s;s may wi&s;h for further in|formation on this &s;ubject; their thoughts and attention having been employed another way.</P>
<P>In what I have to offer on this &s;ubject it is not my intention to run out into a laboured pane|gyric on the utility and importance of Public Cre|dit to a nation, as &s;ome of the writers in favor of the Bank have done; though I am as well con|vinced of both as any of them. My rea&s;on for declining it is, becau&s;e the Bank is a thing that has very little to do with it.</P>
<P>Public Credit entirely depends upon the faith kept by the Government with the Public, in the &s;trict and punctual di&s;charge of her pecuniary obligations.</P>
<P>The Bank is a private trading company, principally in the hands of four or five per&s;ons; who, it is true, have their own private credit to &s;upport, but at pre&s;ent they have no connection what&s;oever with the credit of the Government.</P>
<P>Neither is it my intention to go into an in|ve&s;tigation of the powers of Government and of
<PB N="3" REF="019583_0003_0FAC5BBF7585ACE8">
the A&s;&s;embly to give or to take away charters of incorporation, highly lucrative to private in|dividuals; whereby the &s;ituation of Government is given to tho&s;e individuals, not only without any adequate con&s;ideration, but without any con&s;ideration at all.</P>
<P>I purpo&s;ely omit going into this inve&s;tigation, becau&s;e, if I &s;hould be able to prove that one A&s;&s;embly had not power to repeal a law which a former one had imprudently pa&s;&s;ed, this might be proving too much; becau&s;e it might be made u&s;e of to prove, that a future A&s;&s;embly had no power to alter what a former one had repealed.</P>
<P>Setting a&s;ide the&s;e topics, therefore, I mean to confine my&s;elf to a very few points; and the point I mean chiefly to in&s;i&s;t on is to con|&s;ider, how far the con&s;titution of the Bank is con&s;i&s;tent with the Government and with the pre&s;ent &s;tate of trade and commerce in this country.</P>
<P>This is a &s;ubject that has been but lightly if at all touched upon, and in the pur&s;uit of it I mean to be as candid and as impartial as po&s;&s;ible. I &s;hall carefully avoid all per&s;onalities, and as I profe&s;s to be of no party, having the &s;upreme felicity of being friends with all, I &s;hall as care|fully avoid all party di&s;tinctions.</P>
<P>And fir&s;t then, with regard to the que&s;tion, how far the con&s;titution of the Bank is con&s;i&s;tent with the Government. In order to determine this que&s;tion, it is nece&s;&s;ary to draw a parallel betwixt them.</P>
<P>The con&s;titution of this country, and of this State in particular, is well known to be Repub|lican. The Members of the A&s;&s;embly are cho|&s;en
<PB N="4" REF="019583_0004_0FAC5BC0341632B0">
annually, by the freemen thereof, but no member is eligible to &s;erve for more than four years in &s;even, nor has any inhabitant, let his property be ever &s;o great, more than one an|nual vote.</P>
<P>The directors of the Bank are few in number, only twelve. It is true, they are cho&s;en an|nually, but every proprietor has as many votes as he has &s;hares. Hence a few great &s;tockhol|ders have the power of perpetuating their own election, and that of their friends. Nor is there any provi&s;ion made for a change or &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, by way of rotation. It is not in any re&s;pect de|pendent on Government. Here, therefore, is not only a monopoly, but an ari&s;tocracy, formed of a mo&s;t formidable kind, a monopoly which, by the acqui&s;ition of the &s;anction of Govern|ment, will be capable of ab&s;orbing all the wealth of the United States. And, as wealth creates influence, it is impo&s;&s;ible to tell how far their influence may extend. So much for the con&s;titution of the Bank.</P>
<P>Now with regard to the &s;econd que&s;tion, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> How far the pre&s;ent Bank is con&s;i&s;tent with the pre&s;ent &s;tate of trade and commerce in this country, it may be nece&s;&s;ary to take a &s;ome|what wider range, in order to inquire into the &s;tate and condition of other Banks that have been in&s;tituted in Europe.</P>
<P>If we look abroad, we find the four mo&s;t an|cient and mo&s;t con&s;iderable Banks to be tho&s;e of Am&s;terdam, Venice, Hamburgh and Genoa. The three fir&s;t of which are all in the hands and, con&s;equently, in the intere&s;t of their re&s;pective Governments. The Bank of Genoa was an ex|ception. Machiavel, in his hi&s;tory of Florence,
<PB N="5" REF="019583_0005_0FAC5BC0F412DB38">
tells us, "that a war with the Venetians occa|&s;ioned that Government to borrow great &s;ums of the citizens, for the payment of which they con|&s;igned to them their cu&s;toms, and incorporated them into a Bank, which had the palace over the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e for their meeting, they had a Council of Hundred, and a Magi&s;tracy or Di|rectors of Eight, and divided their credit into loqui or &s;hares in &s;tock, and the body thus con|&s;tituted bore the name of St. George, as the Government had the name of the <HI>Commonalty."</HI></P>
<P>This <HI>Commonalty,</HI> or Commonwealth, had a further occa&s;ion for a loan, and applied to St. George, then grown rich, and the able&s;t, if not the only lender, and for that they mortgaged to it &s;ome lands and towns, as they had done the cu&s;toms before. What was the con&s;equence?</P>
<P>Machiavel tells us, that <HI>mo&s;t of the&s;e towns and lands,</HI> (that were in mortgage to them) <HI>for|merly &s;ubject to the Genoe&s;e, &s;ubmitted to them.</HI> The Hi&s;torian adds, "<HI>And they</HI> (St. George) <HI>governed and defended them,</HI> (the towns and lands) <HI>and every year, by public vote, &s;ent their rectors; and the Commonalty</HI> (that is the Government) <HI>of the city was no way concerned.</HI>" He goes &s;till further, "Whence," &s;ays he, "it came to pa&s;s that tho&s;e citizens have taken away their love to the Rules of the Commonalty, as a thing u&s;urped and tyrannized, (though the ancient con&s;titution) and placed it on St. George, as a Rule well and equally admini&s;tered."</P>
<P>I &s;hould not have &s;aid &s;o much had not the Hi|&s;torian in a manner compelled me to it; but now, &s;ince the murther is out, I cannot refrain from giving you his conclu&s;ion, "Whence," &s;ays he, "(that is from the Bank's admini&s;tration) ari&s;es
<PB N="8" REF="019583_0006_0FAC5BC1B57852F0">
the frequent and ea&s;y change of Government, and that &s;ometimes they obey a citizen, and &s;ometimes a &s;tranger."</P>
<P>I mu&s;t however do our Bank the ju&s;tice to &s;ay, that &s;he differs widely from the Bank of St. George at Genoa, and that in almo&s;t every in|&s;tance. When the monied men in England fir&s;t &s;olicited an e&s;tabli&s;hment of a Bank by Act of Parliament, the argument made u&s;e of in favour of it, was not only a pre&s;ent loan, but a great &s;how of future &s;ervices. But what does the pre|&s;ent Bank of North America offer? Why &s;he in&s;titutes no loan in favour of the Government. She is of a more provident and &s;elfi&s;h nature, &s;he is willing to gain all &s;he can from the &s;anction of Government, but &s;he is not willing to give her any a&s;&s;i&s;tance in return. On the other hand &s;he endeavours to thwart the operations of Go|vernment as much as &s;he can, and ince&s;&s;antly &s;ets her&s;elf up in oppo&s;ition to the Government.</P>
<P>But, &s;econdly, Among the Banks I have men|tioned, which are in the hands of their re&s;pective Governments and pur&s;ue their intere&s;t, there are none of them that i&s;&s;ue notes payable in &s;pecie to bearer upon demand. And yet, perhaps, this is the circum&s;tance that recommends the Bank in this city to mo&s;t people. What is the rea&s;on, they do not i&s;&s;ue notes payable in &s;pecie? Why, the rea&s;on is, becau&s;e they have the intere&s;t of their country at heart.</P>
<P>The Bank of Am&s;terdam is one of the olde&s;t as well as one of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable in Europe, having &s;ub&s;i&s;ted now for near two centuries. She receives coin, but &s;he never pays any. There are indeed ca&s;hiers or brokers always at|tending who are ever ready to exchange ca&s;h
<PB N="7" REF="019583_0007_0FAC5BC275CAD7F0">
for Bank credit; and what is remarkable, is, that this Bank credit is generally upon an ave|rage from three to five per cent. better than the &s;pecie it&s;elf. The rea&s;on why this Bank never pays in &s;pecie, is, becau&s;e &s;he knows very well, that if &s;he was to pay in coin, her country would &s;oon be drained of it. England is the only country in Europe, and I believe I may &s;ay, in the world, where Banks can &s;ub&s;i&s;t i&s;&s;uing notes payable to bearer in &s;pecie upon demand. What is the rea&s;on of it, why &s;he is the only country who&s;e trade is &s;o well protected by laws, that there is never a reflux, but always an influx of wealth, con&s;tantly coming into her. France indeed, following the example of England, has within the&s;e few years in&s;tituted a Bank, i&s;&s;uing notes payable upon demand. The Bank I mean, is the Cai&s;&s;e d'E&s;compte, or Bank of Paris. What was the con&s;equence? Why, let us read the following extract of a letter from Paris, bearing date the 27th of September, 1783.</P>
<P>"The admini&s;trators of the Cai&s;&s;e d'E&s;compte having repre&s;ented to the King, that in con&s;e|quence of the &s;carcity of ca&s;h in their hands, oc|ca&s;ioned by the circum&s;tances of the war, which have prevented the annual and regular importa|tion of gold and &s;ilver, at the &s;ame time that &s;pecie has been exported, they, in order to &s;up|port commerce, and above all that of the city of Paris, where the &s;carcity has been particular|ly felt, have recurred to the re&s;ource which Go|vernment allowed them, in authori&s;ing the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the Cai&s;&s;e d'E&s;compte&mdash;That their zeal to a&s;&s;i&s;t commerce has induced them to di&s;count &s;uch bills of exchange, and good deeds on individuals, as have been pre&s;ented
<PB N="8" REF="019583_0008_0FAC5BC3342AC068">
to them, and have paid tho&s;e bills of exchange in ca&s;h, or in notes of their Bank <HI>payable to the bearer</HI>&mdash;That the confidence of the public in this Bank, has led them to augment the number of the&s;e notes in proportion to the wants of com|merce; but the re&s;ource, by which trade has been &s;o greatly benefited and &s;pecie thrown into circulation, being retarded in its effects, the Cai&s;&s;e d'E&s;compte will be prevented, for a time, from continuing to the public the facility of di&s;count, by the impo&s;&s;ibility of i&s;&s;uing &s;pecie, and even if being able to give ca&s;h for their notes, when they are pre&s;ented in too great quan|tity, unle&s;s provi&s;ion is made by his Maje&s;ty." How extremely &s;imilar, in &s;ome re&s;pects, is the &s;ituation of America, with that of France, at the time alluded to; but further: "It does not appear, however, that any further means are wanting there until the fir&s;t of January next, a period, when it is expected that the cir|culation of &s;pecie will be re-e&s;tabli&s;hed. They therefore pray his Maje&s;ty's protection. In con|&s;equence whereof, the King ordains, that all the notes of the &s;aid Bank &s;hall have circulation till that time in the city of Paris, and be received in payment as before, and that no pro&s;ecutions &s;hall take place on account of their non-pay|ment at the Bank. At the &s;ame time a &s;evere edict was i&s;&s;ued, to prevent the exportation of gold and &s;ilver for a limited time."</P>
<P>Here we &s;ee, in a very &s;triking manner, the bad effects of a wrong balance of trade upon a Bank paying in &s;pecie, even in &s;o great a kingdom, as that of France where &s;pecie abounds, even though this wrong balance was but temporary. But let us proceed&mdash;</P>
<P>"On the fourth of that &s;ame month a new edict
<PB N="9" REF="019583_0009_0FAC5BC3FB5AF628">
of the King appeared, opening a loan of twenty-four millions of livres, for which his Maje&s;ty offered &s;ixty thou&s;and tickets of a new lottery, price four hundred livres each, which makes in all the twenty-four millions wanted. The pur|cha&s;ers of the&s;e tickets, in order to favor the Bank, had the option of paying half the four hundred livres in notes i&s;&s;ued by the Cai&s;&s;e d'E&s;|compte. The lottery was to be drawn during the &s;pace of eight years, and the adventurers were to run no ri&s;que, as the holders of blanks were to be allowed the principal and intere&s;t of their money." Here &s;urely is a mo&s;t extraordi|nary in&s;tance of Royal interpo&s;ition in favour of a Bank. What was the con&s;equence?</P>
<P>Why, notwith&s;tanding all this, &s;o great is the effect of natural cau&s;es that on the fir&s;t of October following the Bank of Paris, called the Cai&s;&s;e d'E&s;compte, &s;topt payment, which occa&s;ioned the utmo&s;t con&s;ternation and horror throughout that city.</P>
<P>The fact is, that no Bank i&s;&s;uing notes payable in &s;pecie upon demand can hold their &s;tation long in any country where there is a &s;trong ba|lance of trade again&s;t that country, let her be reinforced by Royal Edicts or entrenched in Charters, or let her do what &s;he will.</P>
<P>The ca&s;e is plain and obvious&mdash;For &s;up|po&s;ing that balance again&s;t that country to be a Million of pounds, or a Million of dollars per annum, or what you will, is it not plain that &s;o much money mu&s;t be &s;ent out of the country every year as that balance amounts to, in order to pay that wrong balance?</P>
<P>But, it may be &s;aid that money comes into the country every year, as well as it goes out of it. Well then, let us &s;uppo&s;e that Half a Million is
<PB N="10" REF="019583_0010_0FAC5BC4B4352490">
imported annually. Why then the account will &s;tand thus: Half a Million being imported, and a Million going out, this will ju&s;t make Half <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="torn page" EXTENT="1 word"> Million of ca&s;h of which the country <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="torn page" EXTENT="1 span"> drained every year.</P>
<P>If only half a Million, therefore, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="torn page" EXTENT="1 span"> what is imported goes out every <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="torn page" EXTENT="1 span"> years the country will be drained of two <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="torn page" EXTENT="1 span"> and a half, in ten years of five Millions, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="torn page" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;o on.</P>
<P>How then is this demand for ca&s;h for expor|tation to be &s;upplied? Why, &s;urely, no where &s;o readily as at the Bank; for as the Bank is the common receptacle for money, and as &s;he i&s;&s;ues her notes payable in &s;pecie to bearer upon de|mand, is it not in the power of every one who gains po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the&s;e notes to go with them and to demand payment for them at the Bank, and con&s;idering how the Bank is con&s;tituted at pre&s;ent, is it in her power to refu&s;e? Surely not, for the moment &s;he does, that moment &s;he &s;tops payment, and there is an end put to her opera|tions at once. The Bank therefore facilitates the exportation of money, but &s;he not only fa|cilitates the exporation of money in general, but particularly of the be&s;t pieces. That this is no idle &s;uppo&s;ition I my&s;elf can witne&s;s, for I have known per&s;ons keep accounts with the Bank merely for the purpo&s;e of drawing out the be&s;t of the &s;pecie. Thus by paying in their own notes and then drawing for &s;pecie, they have &s;e|lected the be&s;t and &s;o paid the remainder back, and thus after repeated drawings, they have been able to get po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all the be&s;t pieces, in order to &s;end them abroad.</P>
<P>But it may be &s;aid, that when the Bank finds an extraordinary demand of ca&s;h for exportation
<PB N="11" REF="019583_0011_0FAC5BC5757DB9C0">
it is her cu&s;tom to &s;top di&s;counts. That is, in hopes that this demand will cea&s;e, after the &s;ail|ing of a particular ve&s;&s;el, or of a packet for Eu|rope, &s;he, for the pre&s;ent, puts a &s;top to her profits as well as her out-goings, and, in fact, &s;huts up &s;hop; for as her profit ari&s;es from the di&s;counting of bills, the moment &s;he puts a &s;top to this, that moment &s;he puts a &s;top to the pro|fits of her trade. And yet this is far from being any remedy for the evil complained of; the de|mand for ca&s;h to &s;end abroad &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ts and is not &s;upplied, and it only tends to make peo|ple, who have occa&s;ion for this money, more artful, by beginning to draw upon the Bank a little earlier. I &s;hall &s;ay nothing of the great advantage that tho&s;e have, who are concerned in the Bank, in trading with the Bank's money, which gives them a great advantage over other traders, in buying lands, in making u&s;e of the &s;pecie of the Bank for their own remittances, and in the preferences which they have an op|portunity of giving to their friends; all of which are matters of the greate&s;t importance. Suffice it to &s;ay, that if the prayer of the Bank's petition was granted, and the charter re&s;tored <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">on the footing it was before, it is impo&s;&s;ible, in the na|ture of things, that it could afford any thing more than a temporary relief, by creating a tempo|rary confidence: indeed, like the King of France's edict in favor of the Cai&s;&s;e d'E&s;compte, it might induce &s;ome to bring their ca&s;h to the Bank; but the &s;ame cau&s;e exi&s;ting, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> an unfavorable balance of trade, and that &s;till ope|rating again&s;t her, the &s;ame di&s;tre&s;s mu&s;t &s;oon recur, from which &s;he mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily find her &s;elf involved in as much difficulty as before.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="019583_0012_0FAC5BC6357D34F0">
But this method of &s;topping di&s;counts ap|pears to me, I confe&s;s, a mo&s;t extraordinary ex|pedient; and &s;uch a one, as in any other country would be con&s;idered as little &s;hort of committing an act of bankruptcy. It is extraordinary, be|cau&s;e it is not her intere&s;t to do it; and becau&s;e, upon the principles upon which &s;he is con&s;ti|tuted, it is what &s;he is not ju&s;tifiable in doing. Banks are the &s;ervants of the public, and their in&s;titution is intended for the facilitating circu|lation and for the promotion of trade, and the profits they receive for the di&s;counting of bills are the wages they receive for performing that of|fice. To refu&s;e therefore to di&s;count good bills, unexpectedly, and at a time perhaps when they are mo&s;t wanted, is defeating the very purpo&s;e for which they were in&s;tituted. It is a tacit acknowledgment, that they either want ca&s;h, or that they want credit; and it is giving a vital &s;tab to circulation and trade. When they do this, it demon&s;trates that the confidence that was placed in them by their cu&s;tomers was mi&s;|placed, and that they have received wages for performing an office, which, at the time when their a&s;&s;i&s;tance was mo&s;t wanted, they took the liberty to decline. Hence it is that we &s;ee &s;o many running about the &s;treets with di&s;traction and de&s;peration in their countenances; and hence it is that &s;o many have been obliged to &s;top payment who had reckoned upon having their bills di&s;counted as a &s;ure re&s;ource.</P>
<P>But it may be &s;aid that the profits of the Bank mu&s;t be con&s;iderable, notwith&s;tanding their &s;topping di&s;counts, becau&s;e they have made large dividends. Large dividends may be made various ways, by manufacturing their
<PB N="13" REF="019583_0013_0FAC5BC6F3FE5168">
own paper while the public confidence conti|nues, or even by dividing their capital. What their profits are, is be&s;t known to them&s;elves; but that their profits could never be &s;o con&s;ider|able as to afford a dividend of 16 per cent, though they had made no bad debts, even if they had never &s;topt di&s;counts, I am inclined to believe, by comparing it with the dividends that have been made at different times by the Bank of England.</P>
<P>I have before me a li&s;t of the dividends made by the Bank of England, for a matter of &s;eventy years pa&s;t, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> from the year 1715 down to the pre&s;ent time, by which I learn that &s;he never has, in any one year, divided to her creditors more than after the rate of 8 per cent. The li&s;t is as follows, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR></P>
<P>From 1715 to 1719 &s;he divided 8 p. ct. per an.</P>

<P>If the Bank of England therefore, who&s;e bu&s;i|ne&s;s is &s;o much more exten&s;ive, and who has always had an intere&s;t allowed her by the Go|vernment

of at lea&s;t 3 per cent. upon her &s;tock, be&s;ides four thou&s;and pounds a year to defray her expences of management, has never been able to divide among&s;t the proprietors more than 8 per cent. is it probable, that the profits of the Bank of North America, in this city, can have enabled her fairly to divide among&s;t her creditors after the rate of 16 per cent. e&s;pecially when we con&s;ider, that &s;he has no intere&s;t paid her by the Government upon her &s;tock, nor has &s;he any other means of defraying her expences but what ari&s;e out of the profits of her trade.</P>
<P>If this is not a fair inference, I call upon the directors to prove the contrary, by producing a full and fair account of their property and effects, and laying them before the public. This, at lea&s;t, your honourable Hou&s;e, I think, has a right to expect, before they con&s;ent to a renewal of their charter, and a refu&s;al on their part can be con&s;trued into nothing but an acknowledge|ment of their guilt.</P>
<P>For my own part, I own, I am &s;omewhat at a lo&s;s, to account for their extreme &s;olicitude up|on this head. If they have been acting fairly and hone&s;tly, which I always &s;uppo&s;e till it ap|pears to the contrary, where is the great nece&s;|&s;ity for a charter? Is it to &s;creen their own private fortunes from being an&s;werable to the public creditors for debts contracted by the Bank? If it is, let the proprietors look to it. This, I am &s;orry to &s;ay, has been done in other countries, and why may it not in this?</P>
<P>After all that has been &s;aid, I am far from be|ing an enemy to Banks.</P>
<P>Banks have &s;ub&s;i&s;ted for ages in many coun|tries, and have been of the greate&s;t utility. A

Bank, as I before ob&s;erved, has exi&s;ted at Ve|nice, another at Genoa, another at Am&s;terdam, for a great number of years; but they are all of them very differently con&s;tituted from the Bank in this city. They are &s;uited to the con|dition and circum&s;tances of their re&s;pective coun|tries. Were the Bank in this city to continue upon its pre&s;ent plan, i&s;&s;uing notes payable in &s;pecie, for any length of time, it would be the means, by degrees, of transferring all the coin in the country out of it, and we have no mines to afford an inexhau&s;tible &s;upply. This the Bank of St. George once did with re&s;pect to Cor&s;ica, and were Banks paying in coin e&s;tabli&s;hed in Spain, Portugal, or any other country that has a con&s;tant balance of trade again&s;t her, they would only help on their ruin a little fa&s;ter. This had very nearly happened in Scotland in the year 1764. Such a Bank, it is true, may be a pre&s;ent temporary convenience and accom|modation to the merchant, but it is ruin and de&s;truction to the country. Had our greate&s;t enemies been the inventors of this device, they could not have concerted our ruin more effectu|ally, than by recommending the in&s;titution of &s;uch a Bank. And is it any wonder, that Briti&s;h merchants and others &s;hould complain mo&s;t grievou&s;ly of the abolition of a Bank, through the in&s;trumentalilty of which they had been enabled to glean away from us all our money. This is the true rea&s;on of our pre&s;ent &s;carcity of ca&s;h, and if the Bank continues upon its pre&s;ent plan, this &s;carcity of ca&s;h mu&s;t every day grow greater. If European countries are ambitious of our trade, let them con&s;ent to a

&s;ettlement of it upon the only terms upon which it can be carried on, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> A free, open and ge|nerous exchange of their manufactures for our produce through &s;uch channels as may be found convenient for that purpo&s;e. When that is done, and a favourable balance of trade re&s;tored, it will be time enough to in&s;titute Banks, paying in &s;pecie. But if we mu&s;t have a Bank in our pre&s;ent circum&s;tances, it mu&s;t be of a different kind. To conclude,</P>
<P>The que&s;tion, therefore, before the Hou&s;e, in my humble opinion, which I beg leave to &s;ubmit to you, is not, Whether the charter ought to be re&s;tored to the Bank, only limiting the time of its duration and the quantum of its &s;tock, (which I under&s;tand is the thing prayed for) but, Whether it ought to &s;ub&s;i&s;t at all under its pre&s;ent form, or whether it ought not to be new modelled, &s;o as to harmonize with the Go|vernment of this country, and with the pre&s;ent &s;tate of trade and commerce.</P>
