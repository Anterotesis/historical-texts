<HEAD>ON THE CAUSES, NATURE, AND CURE, OF CONSUMPTIONS.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>NAPLES, &mdash;,</DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR account of our friend's &s;tate of health, gives me much concern; the more, as I cannot approve the change he has made of a phy&s;ician. You &s;ay, the Doctor, under who&s;e care he is at pre&s;ent, has employed his mind &s;o entirely, in medical re&s;earches, that he &s;carce|ly di&s;plays a grain of common &s;en&s;e, when the conver&s;ation turns on any other &s;ubject; and that, although he &s;eems opinionative, vain, and often|tatious in his profe&s;&s;ion, and full of fal&s;e and ab&s;urd ideas, in the common affairs of life, yet he is a very able phy&s;ician, and has performed many wonderful cures. Be a&s;&s;ured, my dear Sir, that this is impo&s;&s;ible; for medical &s;kill is not like the rod of an inchanter, which may be found
<PB N="10" REF="017607_0009_0FA1DAAD6D70A508">
accidentally, and which transfers its miraculous powers indi&s;criminately, to a blockhead, or a man of &s;en&s;e. The number of weak, go&s;&s;ip|ping men, who have made fortunes by this pro|fe&s;&s;ion, do not prove the contrary. I do not &s;ay, that men, of that kind, cannot make for|tunes; I only a&s;&s;ert, they are not the mo&s;t likely to cure di&s;ea&s;es. An intere&s;t with the apo|thecaries, nur&s;es, and a few talkative old ladies, will enable them to do the fir&s;t; but a clear under&s;tanding, and a con&s;iderable &s;hare of na|tural &s;agacity are qualities e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;econd, and for every bu&s;ine&s;s which requires reflection. Without the&s;e, fal&s;e inferences will be drawn from experience it&s;elf; and learn|ing will tend to confirm a man in his errors, and to render him more completely a coxcomb.</P>
<P>The profe&s;&s;ion of phy&s;ic is that, of all others, in which the generality of mankind have the fewe&s;t lights, by which they can di&s;cern the a|bilities of its profe&s;&s;ors; becau&s;e the &s;tudies which lead to it are more out of the road of
<PB N="11" REF="017607_0010_0FA1DAAFAD011288">
u&s;ual education, and the practice more inveloped in technical terms and hieroglyphical &s;igns. But I imagine the &s;afe&s;t criterion by which men, who have not been bred to that profe&s;&s;ion, can form a judgment of tho&s;e who have, is, the degree of &s;aga|city and penetration, they di&s;cover on &s;ubjects equally open to mankind in general, and which ought to be under&s;tood by all who live in &s;ociety. You do not mention particularly what has been pre&s;cribed by either; only, that the former phy&s;i|cian &s;eemed to rely almo&s;t entirely on exerci&s;e and regimen, whereas the pre&s;ent flatters our friend with a &s;peedy cure, by the help of the Pectoral and Bal&s;amic Medicines which he orders, in &s;uch abundance, and which he declares are &s;o efficaci|ous in <HI>pulmonary con&s;umptions.</HI></P>
<P>Having lamented with you the mournful events which render the name of that di&s;ea&s;e peculiarly alarming to you, and knowing your friendly &s;o|licitude about Mr. &mdash;, I do not wonder at your earne&s;t de&s;ire to know &s;omething of the na|ture
<PB N="12" REF="017607_0011_0FA1DAB074F9C868">
of a di&s;temper with which he is threatened, and which has proved fatal to &s;o many of our friends. But I am &s;urpri&s;ed that you have not cho&s;en a more enlightened in&s;tructor, when you have &s;o many around you. Though con&s;cious that I have no ju&s;t claim to all the obliging ex|pre&s;&s;ions which your partiality to my opinion has prompted you to make u&s;e of, yet I am too much flattered by &s;ome of them, to refu&s;e complying with your reque&s;t. My &s;entiments, &s;uch as they are, will at lea&s;t have the merit of being clearly under|&s;tood. I &s;hall ob&s;erve your prohibition, not to refer you to any medical book; and &s;hall care|fully avoid all technical terms, which you &s;o much abominate. With regard to your &s;hewing my Letter to any of the faculty; if you find your|&s;elf &s;o inclined, I have not the &s;malle&s;t objection; for tho&s;e who have the greate&s;t knowledge in their profe&s;&s;ion, are be&s;t acquainted with its uncertainty, and mo&s;t indulgent to the mi&s;takes or errors of others.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="017607_0012_0FA1DAB1732B7CC0">Alas, my friend! how is it po&s;&s;ible that phy&s;i|cians &s;hould avoid mi&s;takes? If the able&s;t mechan|ic were to attempt to remedy the irregular move|ments of a watch, while he remained ignorant of the &s;tructure and manner of acting of &s;ome of the principal &s;prings, would he not be in danger of do|ing harm in&s;tead of good? Phy&s;icians are in the &s;ituation of &s;uch a mechanic; for, although it is evident that the nerves are the organs or motion and &s;en&s;ation, yet their &s;tructure is not known. Some anatomi&s;ts a&s;&s;ert they are impervious cords; others, that they are &s;lender tubes, containing a fluid. But what the nature of this fluid is; whe|ther it &s;erves only to nouri&s;h the nerves them&s;elves, or is the medium by which they convey feeling and the power of motion to other parts, is not a&s;|certained even by tho&s;e who argue for its exi&s;tence; far le&s;s is it explained in what manner ideas, form|ed within the brain, can, by the means of &s;olid cords, or by a fluid contained in tubes, communi|cate motion at plea&s;ure to the legs and arms. We are ignorant why the will, which has no influence
<PB N="14" REF="017607_0013_0FA1DAB1E44026C0">
over the motion of an animal's heart, &s;hould find the feet obedient to her dictates; and we can no more explain how a man can move one leg over the other by volition, or the mere act of willing, than how he could, by the &s;ame means, move O&s;&s;a on the top of Olympus. The one happens every moment, the other would be con&s;idered as a mira|cle; but they are equally unaccountable. While parts &s;o infinitely e&s;&s;ential to life are not under|&s;tood, in&s;tead of being &s;urpri&s;ed that &s;o many di&s;|ea&s;es baffle the &s;kill of the phy&s;ician, we have more rea&s;on to be a&s;toni&s;hed that any can be alleviated or cured by his art.</P>
<P>The pen of the &s;atiri&s;t, no doubt, may be fairly aimed again&s;t the pre&s;umption and ignorance of many individuals of this, as of every other profe&s;|&s;ion; but cannot with ju&s;tice be directed again&s;t the art it&s;elf: &s;ince, in &s;pite of the ob&s;curity which &s;till involves &s;ome parts of the animal oeconomy, many di&s;orders are relieved, and &s;ome of the &s;e|vere&s;t and mo&s;t di&s;agreeable to which the human
<PB N="15" REF="017607_0014_0FA1DAB29F028D88">
body is liable, are cured with certainty by the art of medicine.</P>
<P>Unfortunately for mankind, and in a particular manner for the people of Great Britain, the pul|monary con&s;umption is not of the number.</P>
<P>This di&s;ea&s;e may originate from various cau&s;es:</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. An external brui&s;e or wound.</P>
<P N="2">2d. The di&s;ea&s;e called pleuri&s;y, including in that term an inflammation of the lungs them|&s;elves, as well as the membrane which covers them.</P>
<P N="3">3d. The bur&s;ting of &s;ome of the blood-ve&s;&s;els of the lungs, independent of external injury, and owing to a faulty conformation of the che&s;t, and the &s;lenderne&s;s of the ve&s;&s;els.</P>
<P N="4">4th. Certain &s;mall tumours, called tubercles, in the lungs.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="017607_0015_0FA1DAB362706800">The fir&s;t cau&s;e I have mentioned is an external brui&s;e or wound.</P>
<P>An accident of that kind happening to the lungs, is more dangerous and difficult to cure, than when the &s;ame takes place in mo&s;t other parts of the bo|dy; becau&s;e the lungs are vital organs, e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary to life, and when their motion is impair|ed, other animal functions are thereby injured; be|cau&s;e they are of an uncommonly delicate texture, in which a rupture having once taken place, will be apt to encrea&s;e; becau&s;e they are in con&s;tant motion and expo&s;ed to the acce&s;s of external air, both of which circum&s;tances are unfavourable to the healing of wounds, and becau&s;e the ma&s;s of blood di&s;tributed to the whole body pa&s;&s;es previou&s;|ly through the lungs, and con&s;equently the blood-ve&s;&s;els of this organ are more numerous than tho&s;e of any other part of the body.</P>
<P>When we con&s;ider the&s;e peculiarities, it is na|tural to conclude, that every wound of the lungs mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily prove mortal; but experience has
<PB N="17" REF="017607_0016_0FA1DB2C458D0928">
taught the contrary. Many wounds of the lungs heal of them&s;elves, by what is called, the fir&s;t in|tention. The phy&s;ician may prevent a fever, by ordering the patient to lo&s;e blood in proper quanti|ties, and he may regulate the diet; but the cure mu&s;t be left to nature, which &s;he will perform with greater certainty, if &s;he is not di&s;turbed by any of tho&s;e bal&s;ams which the wounded are &s;ometimes directed to &s;wallow on &s;uch occa&s;ions. But when the wound, either from injudicious treat|ment, or from its &s;ize, or from the bad habit of the patient, degenerates into an ulcer, attended with hectic &s;ymptoms, the di&s;ea&s;e mu&s;t be treated as if it had ari&s;en from any of the other cau&s;es.</P>
<P>The pleuri&s;y, or inflammation of the lungs, is a di&s;ea&s;e more frequent in cold countries than in mild; in the &s;pring, than in the other &s;ea&s;ons; and more apt to &s;eize people of a &s;anguine con|&s;titution than others.</P>
<P>Plentiful and repeated bleedings, fomentations, bli&s;ters near the affected pa&s;t, and a cooling, dilu|ting
<PB N="18" REF="017607_0017_0FA1DB2D8719E2E8">
regimen, generally remove it, without its leav|ing any bad con&s;equence. Sometimes, by the omi&s;&s;ion of bleeding in due quantity at the begin|ning and &s;ometimes in &s;pite of all po&s;&s;ible care, it terminates in an ab&s;ce&s;s, which, on bur&s;ting, may &s;uffocate the patient; or, if the matter is coughed up, becomes an open ulcer, and produces the di&s;|ea&s;e in que&s;tion.</P>
<P>The third cau&s;e of the pulmonary con&s;umption above mentioned, is, a &s;pitting of blood, from the bur&s;ting of ve&s;&s;els of the lungs, independent of ex|ternal wound or brui&s;e. People of a fair complex|ion, delicate &s;kin, &s;lender make, long neck, and narrow che&s;t, are more &s;ubject to this than others. Tho&s;e who have a predi&s;po&s;ition to this complaint, by their form, are mo&s;t apt to be attacked after their full growth: women from fifteen to three-and-thirty; men two or three years later. In Great Britain, a &s;pitting of blood generally occurs to tho&s;e predi&s;po&s;ed to it, in the &s;pring, or begin|ning of &s;ummer, when the weather &s;uddenly changes from cold to exce&s;&s;ive hot; and when the
<PB N="19" REF="017607_0018_0FA1DB2FC9F06B18">
heat is &s;uppo&s;ed to ratify the blood, before the &s;o|lids are proportionably relaxed from the contracted &s;tate they acquire during the cold of winter. When a &s;pitting of blood happens to a per&s;on who has actually lo&s;t brothers or &s;i&s;ters, or other near relations, by the pulmonary con&s;umption, as that circum&s;tance gives rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect a family taint or predi&s;po&s;ition, the ca&s;e will, on that account be more dangerous.</P>
<P>Violent exerci&s;e, may occa&s;ion the rupture of blood-ve&s;&s;els in the lungs, even in tho&s;e who have no hereditary di&s;po&s;ition to &s;uch an accident; it ought therefore to be carefully avoided by all who have. Violent exerci&s;e in the &s;pring, is more dangerous than in other &s;ea&s;ons; and, when taken at the top of high mountains, by tho&s;e who do not u&s;ually re&s;ide there, it has been con&s;idered as more dangerous than in vallies. The &s;udden diminution of the weight of the atmo&s;phere co-operating with the exerci&s;e, renders the ve&s;&s;els more apt to break. Of all things the mo&s;t pernicious to peo|ple

<P>The moi&s;t, foggy, and changeable weather, which prevails in Great Britain, renders its inhabi|tants more liable, than tho&s;e of milder and more uniform climates, to catarrhs, rheumati&s;ms, pleuri|&s;ies, and other di&s;ea&s;es proceeding from ob&s;tructed

per&s;piration. The &s;ame cau&s;e &s;ubjects the inhabi|tants of Great Britain to ob&s;tructions of the glands, &s;crophulous complaints, and tubercles in the &s;ub|&s;tance of the lungs. The &s;crophulous di&s;ea&s;e is more frequent than is generally imagined. For one per&s;on in whom it appears by &s;wellings in the glands below the chin, and other external marks, many have the internal glands affected by it. This is well known to tho&s;e who are accu&s;tomed to o|pen dead bodies. On examining the bodies of &s;uch as have died of the pulmonary con&s;umption, be&s;ides the open ulcers in the lungs, many little hard tumours or tubercles are generally found; &s;ome, with matter; others, on being cut open, di&s;cover a little bluei&s;h &s;pot, of the &s;ize of a &s;mall lead &s;hot. Here the &s;uppuration, or formation of matter, is ju&s;t going to begin; and in &s;ome the tu|bercle is perfectly hard, and the colour whiti&s;h, throughout its whole &s;ub&s;tance. Tubercles may remain for a con&s;iderable time in the lungs, in this indolent &s;tate, without much inconveniency; but, when excited to inflammation by frequent ca|tarrhs, or other irritating cau&s;es, matter is formed,
<PB N="23" REF="017607_0022_0FA1DB32E08AC7B0">
they break, and produce an ulcer. Care and at|tention may prevent tubercles from inflammation, or may prevent <HI>that</HI> from terminating in the for|mation of matter; but when matter is actually formed, and the tubercle has become an ab&s;ce&s;s, no remedy can &s;top its progre&s;s. It mu&s;t go on till it bur&s;ts. If this happens near any of the large air ve&s;&s;els, immediate &s;uffocation may en&s;ue; but, for the mo&s;t part, the matter is coughed up.</P>
<P>From the circum&s;tances above enumerated of the delicate texture, con&s;tant motion, and nume|rous blood-ve&s;&s;els of the lungs, it is natural to imagine, that a breach of this nature in their &s;ub|&s;tance, will be &s;till more difficult to heal, than a wound from an external cau&s;e. So unque&s;tion|ably it is; yet there are many in&s;tances of even this kind of breach being repaired; the matter expectorated dimini&s;hing in quantity every day, and the ulcer gradually healing; not, &s;urely, by the power of medicine, but by the con&s;tant di&s;|po&s;ition and tendency which exi&s;ts in nature, by

in&s;crutable means of her own, to re&s;tore health to the human body.</P>
<P>It may be proper to ob&s;erve, that tho&s;e per&s;ons who&s;e formation of body renders them mo&s;t liable to a &s;pitting of blood, have al&s;o a greater predi&s;|po&s;ition than others to tubercles in the lungs. The di&s;ea&s;e, called the &s;pa&s;modic a&s;thma, has been reckoned among the cau&s;es of the pulmonary con|&s;umption. It would require a much greater de|gree of confidence in a man's own judgment, than I have in mine, to a&s;&s;ert, that this complaint has no tendency to produce tubercles in the lungs; but I may &s;ay, with truth, that I have often known the &s;pa&s;modic a&s;thma, in the mo&s;t violent degree, at|tended with the mo&s;t alarming &s;ymptoms, continue to harra&s;s the patients for a long period of time, and at length &s;uddenly di&s;appear, without ever re|turning; the per&s;ons who have been thus afflicted, enjoying perfect health for many years after. It is not probable that tubercles were formed in any of the&s;e ca&s;es; and it is certain they were not in

&s;ome, who&s;e bodies were opened after their death, which happened from other di&s;tempers, the a&s;thma having di&s;appeared &s;everal years before.</P>
<P>Certain eruptions of the &s;kin, attended with fe|ver, particularly the &s;mall-pox, and &s;till oftener, the mea&s;les, leave after them a foundation for the pulmonary con&s;umption. From which ever of the cau&s;es above enumerated this di&s;ea&s;e takes its ori|gin, when once an ulcer, attended with a hectic fe|ver, is formed in the lungs, the ca&s;e is, in the high|e&s;t degree, dangerous. When it ends fatally, the &s;ymptoms are, a quick pul&s;e, and a &s;en&s;ation of cold, while the patient's &s;kin, to the feeling of eve|ry other per&s;on, is hot; irregular &s;hiverings, a &s;e|vere cough, expectoration of matter &s;treaked with blood, morning &s;weats, a circum&s;cribed &s;pot of a crim&s;on colour on the cheeks, heat of the palms of the hands, exce&s;&s;ive emaciation, crooking of the nails, &s;welling of the legs, giddine&s;s, delirium, &s;oon followed by death.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="017607_0025_0FA1DB3537E791B8">The&s;e &s;ymptoms do not appear in every ca&s;e.

To particulari&s;e the drugs which have been long in u&s;e, and have been ho|noured with the highe&s;t encomiums for their great efficacy in healing inward brui&s;es, ulcers of the lungs, and confirmed con&s;umptions, would in

Mercury, which has been found &s;o powerful in di&s;po&s;ing other ulcers to heal, has no good effect on ulcers of that organ;&mdash;though &s;ome phy&s;icians imagine it may be of &s;ervice in the beginning to di&s;&s;olve tubercles, before they begin to &s;uppurate; but as there is no ab&s;olute evidence, during life, of indo|lent tubercles being formed, there can be none that mercury cures them.</P>
<P>Various kinds of gums, with the natural and artificial bal&s;ams, were long &s;uppo&s;ed to promote
<PB N="28" REF="017607_0027_0FA1DB36B4BBEC78">
the healing of external wounds and ulcers, and on that account were made the ba&s;is of a va&s;t variety of ointments and plai&s;ters.

The rea&s;oning on which the practice was e&s;tabli&s;hed, however, &s;eems a little &s;hallow, and is far from being conclu&s;ive; for although it were granted, that the&s;e bal&s;ams contributed to the cure of wounds, when applied directly to the part, it does not follow that they could carry their healing powers, unimpaired, from the &s;tomach to the lungs, through the whole pro|ce&s;s of dige&s;tion. But more accurate &s;urgery having made it manife&s;t, that the granulations which &s;pring up to &s;upply the lo&s;s of &s;ub&s;tance in external wounds, and the healing or &s;kinning over of all kinds of &s;ores, proceeds from no active vir|tue in the plai&s;ters or ointments with which they are dre&s;&s;ed, but is entirely the work of nature, and

This is &s;uffi|cient to prove, at lea&s;t, that their efficacy is very problematical. For my own part, after the fair|e&s;t trials and the mo&s;t accurate ob&s;ervations, I have been able to make, I cannot &s;ay that I ever knew them of &s;ervice in any hectic complaint proceeding from an ulcer in the lungs; and I have generally found tho&s;e phy&s;icians, on who&s;e judgment I have more reliance than on my own, of the &s;ame opi|nion.</P>

when it is accu&s;tomed to it by degrees; and in tho&s;e ca&s;es where it does not occa&s;ion pains in the &s;to|mach and bowels, or other immediate inconveni|encies, it has been thought to have a good effect in abating the force of the hectic fever.</P>
<P>I have met with two ca&s;es, &s;ince I have been la&s;t abroad, in both of which there &s;eemed to be a quicker recovery than I ever &s;aw, from the &s;ame &s;ymptoms. The fir&s;t was that of a young lady, of about &s;eventeen years of age, and apparently of a very healthy con&s;titution. In bad weather, during the &s;pring, &s;he caught cold: this being neglected in the beginning, gradually grew wor&s;e. When phy&s;icians were at length con&s;ulted, their pre&s;crip|tions &s;eemed to have as bad an effect as her own neglect. By the middle of &s;ummer her cough was ince&s;&s;ant, accompanied with hectic fever and flu&s;hings, irregular &s;hiverings, morning &s;weats, emaciation, expectoration of purulent phlegm &s;treaked with blood, and every indication of an open ulcer in the lungs. In this de&s;perate &s;tate
<PB N="42" REF="017607_0041_0FA1DB4897F4FEE0">
&s;he was carried from the town to a finely &s;ituated village in Switzerland, where, for &s;everal months, &s;he lived in the middle of a vineyard, on ripe grapes and bread. She had been directed to a milk and vegetable diet in general. Her own ta&s;te inclined her to the grapes, which &s;he continu|ed, on finding, that, with this diet only, &s;he was le&s;s languid, and of a more natural coolne&s;s, and that the cough, fever, and all the other &s;ymptoms gradually abated. She &s;eemed to be brought from the jaws of death by the change of air, and this regimen only; and &s;he returned to her own home in high &s;pirits, and with the look and vigour of health. The en&s;uing winter, after being heated with dancing at the hou&s;e of a friend, &s;he walked home in a cold night? the cough, &s;pitting of blood, and other &s;ymptoms immediately returned, and &s;he died three months after.</P>
<P>In the other ca&s;e, there was not &s;uch a degree of fever, but there was an expectoration of matter, frequently &s;treaked with blood, and evident &s;igns of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">. The p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters"> who laboured

under the&s;e &s;ymptoms, had tried the u&s;ual reme|dies of pectorals, pills, linctu&s;es, &amp;c. with the u&s;ual &s;ucce&s;s. He grew daily wor&s;e. He had formerly found much relief from bleeding, but had left it off for many months, on a &s;uppo&s;ition that it had lo&s;t all effect; and he had allowed an i&s;&s;ue to be healed, on the &s;ame &s;uppo&s;ition; though he &s;till per&s;evered in a milk regimen. I mentioned to him the ca&s;e of the young lady, as it is above recited. He immediately took the re&s;olution to confine him|&s;elf to bread and grapes for almo&s;t his only food. I advi&s;ed him at the &s;ame time to have the i&s;&s;ue opened, and to continue that drain for &s;ome time; but this he did not comply with, He for&s;ook, however, the town for the country, and pa&s;&s;ed as much of the morning on hor&s;eback, as he could bear without fatigue. He &s;oon was able to bear more; and after about three weeks or a month, his cough had greatly abated. When he had per|&s;i&s;ted in this regimen between two and three months, he had very little cough; and what he &s;pit up was pure phlegm, unmixed with blood or matter. He has now been well above a year; and
<PB N="44" REF="017607_0043_0FA1DB4D1E649BF0">
although I under&s;tand that he occa&s;ionally takes animal food, he has hitherto felt no inconveniency from it. He pa&s;&s;ed the &s;econd autumn, as he had done the fir&s;t, at a hou&s;e in the country, &s;urrounded with vineyards. The greater part of his food con&s;i&s;ted of ripe grapes and bread. With &s;uch a diet he had not occa&s;ion for much drink of any kind; what he u&s;ed was &s;imple water, and he made an ample provi&s;ion of grapes for the &s;ucceed|ing winter.</P>
<P>Though I have no idea that there is any &s;pecific virtue in grapes, for the cure of the pulmo|nary con&s;umption, or that they are greatly prefer|able to &s;ome other cooling, &s;ub-acid, mild fruit, equally agreeable to the ta&s;te, provided any &s;uch can be found; yet I thought it right to particular|ize what was u&s;ed on tho&s;e two occa&s;ions; leaving it to others to determine, what &s;nare of the happy con&s;equences I have enumerated were owing to the change of air, how much may have flowed from the exerci&s;e, how much from the regimen, and
<PB N="45" REF="017607_0044_0FA1DB4E6E1666A0">
whether there is rea&s;on to think, that the favour|able turn in both ca&s;es depended on other circum|&s;tances, unob&s;erved by me.</P>
<P>I have now, my dear Sir, complied with your reque&s;t; and although I have endeavoured to avoid technical verbo&s;ity, and all unnece&s;&s;ary detail, yet I find my letter has &s;welled to a great|er &s;ize than I expected. I &s;hall be exceedingly happy to hear that any hint I have given has been &s;erviceable to our friend. If the cough &s;hould &s;till continue, after he has pa&s;&s;ed two or three months at Bri&s;tol, I imagine the mo&s;t effectual thing he can do, will be, to take a voyage to this place; he will by that means e&s;cape the &s;everity of a Briti&s;h win|ter. The voyage it&s;elf will be of &s;ervice, and at the end of it he will have the benefit of the mild air of the Campag a Felice, be refre&s;hed and nouri&s;h|ed by the fine&s;t grapes, and, when tired of riding, he will have continual opportunities of &s;ailing in this charming bay.</P>
