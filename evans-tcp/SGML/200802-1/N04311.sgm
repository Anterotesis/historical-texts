<P>_'_TIS the ju&s;t ob&s;ervation of the contemplative <HI>P&s;almi&s;t,</HI> that the heavens declare the glory of GOD, and the firmament &s;heweth his handy-work; and that the earth is the LORD'S, and the fulne&s;s thereof, he hath founded it upon the &s;eas and e&s;tabli&s;hed it upon the floods. Now if GOD had wi&s;dom to contrive, and power to effect the&s;e beautiful globes, he has an indi&s;putable right to

the government of them, and is certainly qualified for it: Nor may it be thought, that it does not com|port with his maje&s;ty, or is an ob&s;truction to his quiet and happine&s;s to concern him&s;elf in the government of the world. The notion of <HI>Lucretius</HI> is contradic|tory to that idea of the divine being, the oracles of truth furni&s;h us with. To &s;uppo&s;e, that, when he had made the world, he took no further thought or care, but left it to &s;hift for it&s;elf, implies one or other of the&s;e ab&s;urdities, that he either made it for no wi&s;e de&s;ign, or through &s;ome mi&s;take in its formation it did not an&s;wer his original purpo&s;e; like an un&s;kilful artificer, not having framed his work according to the model of it in his own mind, throws it by, and does not care what becomes of it: But as it is a mo&s;t wi&s;e production, that has no blotches or blunders in it, but in all its parts exqui&s;itely done, and every way corre&s;pondent to the de&s;ign in the eternal mind, there can be no rea&s;on upon this account why he &s;hould not govern it. And then, as he is a mo&s;t wi&s;e agent, and all his works the effects of coun&s;el, and con&s;e|quently had &s;ome wi&s;e de&s;ign in making it, 'tis ab&s;o|lutely nece&s;&s;ary for him to govern it, in order to ac|compli&s;h that de&s;ign; and how can he act more like him&s;elf, and di&s;play the glory of his perfections better, than by pre&s;erving the &s;everal ranks of beings, in that harmonious and admirable order they were placed in at fir&s;t? or why &s;hould it be thought below his dig|nity to regard the works of his own hands? or can it be any difficulty to an omni&s;cient and omnipotent being to attend &s;uch a number of things as the govern|ment of the world includes? To imagine this is to

limit the mo&s;t high, deba&s;e his excellencies, and bring him down upon a level with his creatures, and to think that becau&s;e we find our minds and powers &s;o narrow and limited, that a &s;mall number of objects bound our thoughts and cares, therefore the in&s;pec|tion of &s;o many mu&s;t be a burden to GOD him&s;elf. It becomes us better to confe&s;s and adore with the <HI>p&s;almi&s;t,</HI> than to object again&s;t providence, <HI>The</HI> LORD <HI>reigneth, he is clothed with maje&s;ty.&mdash;he is the king of all the earth.</HI> But then, as to the <HI>form</HI> of that govern|ment which he exerci&s;es, it is a &s;ubject &s;o &s;ublime and my&s;terious that we can &s;ay but little of it; and therefore having a&s;&s;erted that <HI>the</HI> LORD <HI>reigns,</HI> he pre&s;ently adds, that <HI>clouds and darkne&s;s are round about him. His way is in the &s;ea, his path in the mighty waters, and his foot&s;teps are not known.</HI> But tho', the <HI>arcana imperii</HI> are an height we can't reach, a depth we can't fathom, yet we mu&s;t think there is a great deal of rea&s;on and righteou&s;ne&s;s in them; and that a mo&s;t beautiful &s;cene would open to us, if we were let into all the &s;ecret &s;prings of the divine government, and could trace the various &s;teps and gradation by which every de&s;ign in accompli&s;hed.</P>
<P>Good men, in all ages, have been &s;o well &s;atisfied with the wi&s;dom, goodne&s;s and equity of providence, that they have acquie&s;ced in it, <HI>rejoiced in tribulation,</HI> triumphed when &s;urrounded with greate&s;t dangers, and thick and black clouds have impended over the church or &s;tate, and threatned its &s;ubver&s;ion.</P>
<P>It is from our profe&s;&s;ed belief of his all-di&s;po&s;ing providence, and ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of our ab&s;olute dependance upon it, and of our duty to <HI>acknowledge GOD in all

our ways,</HI> and implore his direction in an affair of the highe&s;t importance, and wherein the intere&s;t of the province, both civil and religious, is &s;o nearly con|cerned, that we are now a&s;&s;embled in this hou&s;e of wor&s;hip.</P>
<P>Thanks be to the LORD upon the <HI>throne,</HI> that our <HI>civil liberties</HI> granted by the ROYAL CHARTER are continued, under the au&s;picious reign of king GEORGE the IId; and that this day is again revolved upon us, wherein the <HI>heads of our tribes,</HI> are met together to &s;elect and con&s;titute, by the con&s;ent of the <HI>governour,</HI> one main branch of our <HI>legi&s;lature.</HI></P>
<P>And whereas your <HI>Excellency</HI> and the <HI>honourable Board</HI> have called me, however unworthy, to declare the coun&s;els of heaven to you, upon this occa&s;ion; <HI>&s;tirring up your pure minds, by way of remembrance,</HI> I de&s;ire to &s;peak with humility and fear, as becomes the oracles of GOD, and with fidelity to my great LORD and MASTER, knowing that I mu&s;t give an account.</P>
<P>When the angel of the LORD appeared unto <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> in a flame of fire, out of the mid&s;t of a Bu&s;h, he &s;aid, <HI>I will now turn a&s;ide, and &s;ee this great &s;ight;</HI> &s;o let us all now turn a&s;ide, for a while, and lift up our eyes above the hills, above the firmament, and behold with the wondring <HI>prophet</HI> the LORD <HI>&s;itting upon a throne high and lifted up.</HI></P>
<P>The prophet <HI>I&s;aiah</HI> was of noble birth, of the royal family, and <HI>nephew</HI> to king <HI>Uzziah</HI> he here &s;peaks of, as the <HI>Jews</HI> relate. And he was of a <HI>noble &s;pirit,</HI> and not exceeeded by any that prophe&s;ied be|fore, or after him in clearne&s;s and abundance of
<PB N="9" REF="005326_0008_1016FF731276F1A8">
vi&s;ions, and revelations, e&s;pecially concerning the MESSIAH; and in a curious and polite, lofty and maje&s;tick &s;tile.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t words of my text &s;pread a melancholy gloom upon the face of rulers. <HI>In the year that king</HI> Uzziah <HI>died.</HI> Tho' a <HI>great</HI> man in <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> and a <HI>good</HI> man, yet <HI>he died.</HI> Neither grace nor grandure can exempt from death. Princes, who are in a qua|lified &s;en&s;e the <HI>breath of a people's no&s;trils,</HI> derive their breath from GOD; and when it plea&s;es him, the &s;o|vereign arbiter of life, <HI>their breath goes forth, they re|turn to the earth, and in that very day their thoughts peri&s;h.</HI> Whatever di&s;tinction GOD, in his providence, has made betwixt one man and another, in civil re&s;pects, they are all in death's account equal. King <HI>Uzziah'</HI>s reign was long and pro&s;perous, and <HI>Judah</HI> was happy under it; but he mu&s;t not live always: It is the prerogative of him, whom the <HI>prophet &s;aw upon the throne,</HI> to be the KING ETERNAL.</P>
<P>It was in the year of this king's death, that <HI>I&s;aiah</HI> had his vi&s;ion. GOD, <HI>at &s;undry times, and in divers manners, &s;pake in time pa&s;t unto the fathers by the prophets;</HI> &s;ometimes by dreams, &s;ometimes by a audible voice, and &s;ometimes by vi&s;ions, as here to <HI>I&s;aiah,</HI> and afterwards to <HI>Ezekiel</HI> by the river <HI>Chebar.</HI> It is not to be &s;uppo&s;ed, that the eyes of the <HI>prophet</HI> were &s;o &s;trengthned by a &s;upernatural power, as that he &s;aw into the third heaven, at &s;o va&s;t a di&s;tance; but he had a repre&s;entation of the light &amp; glory of it, conveyed to his mind by &s;ome &s;en&s;ible images, and of the LORD <HI>&s;itting upon a throne</HI> there, not like king <HI>Solomon'</HI>s, a <HI>throne of ivory, and overlaid with the

pure&s;t gold,</HI> but a<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Ezekiel</HI> i. 26.</NOTE> <HI>&s;aphire throne,</HI> tran&s;cendently bright and glorious, above all competition or controul, and commanding over all other thrones.</P>
<P>There are &s;everal important articles which might come under our con&s;ideration here, as the heads of my pre&s;ent di&s;cour&s;e:</P>
<P>As,
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. <HI>The</HI> per&s;on <HI>whom the prophet &s;aw thus exalted and dignified.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>II. The import <HI>of his advancement, or the ideas it &s;erves to convey to us.</HI></ITEM>

</LIST></P>
<P>But I mu&s;t confine my&s;elf to the two fir&s;t of the&s;e heads.</P>
<P>I. Then, <HI>I am to con&s;ider</HI> who <HI>it is that the</HI> prophet <HI>&s;aw upon the throne.</HI></P>
<P>It could not be any <HI>meer</HI> man, or an <HI>angel,</HI> a&s;&s;um|ing a human form. It is the place of the angelical orders to &s;tand about the throne, and mini&s;ter unto it; and this is honour enough for them. It was a <HI>divine per&s;on,</HI> the SON OF GOD, the <HI>root</HI> and the <HI>off&s;pring of David,</HI> the <HI>bright</HI> and <HI>morning &s;tar.</HI> Some think it was the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> of the divine per&s;ons who was exhibited to the prophet, and that we read of a like appearance of his, Dan. vii. 9. <HI>I beheld till the thrones were ca&s;t down, and the ancient of days did &s;it, who&s;e garment was white as &s;now, and the hair of his head like the pure woo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, his throne was like the fiery flame, and his wheels <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> burning fire,</HI> &amp;c. But I rather think

this to be under&s;tood of CHRIST, who is called the <HI>ancient of days,</HI> becau&s;e of his immutable and eternal <HI>divinity,</HI> and that it is a mi&s;take to a&s;&s;ert that the FATHER, or the HOLY GHOST ever appeared in &s;uch a low and diminutive form; but the SON often oc|ca&s;ionally did &s;o, for he was to be incarnate, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> his glory, and dwell among us. Thus he appeared to <HI>Abraham;</HI> and in the &s;ame &s;hape, upon the burning mount, at the giving of the law; and, in the like manner to <HI>I&s;aiah;</HI> for &s;o the vi&s;ion is explained, John 12. 41. <HI>The&s;e things &s;aid</HI> I&s;aiah, <HI>when he &s;aw his glory and &s;pake of him:</HI> All which appearances were undoubtedly de&s;igned to prefigure his a&s;&s;umption of the nature of man, and its &s;ub&s;equent advancement to the throne of GOD, the authority of a prince and a judge there.</P>
<P>Whether he a&s;&s;umed the form of that individual body he appeared in afterwards, is an inquiry more <HI>&s;peculative</HI> than <HI>practical.</HI></P>
<P>To &s;et upon the throne of his FATHER was the glory he had with him before all worlds, and which he had a <HI>natural</HI> right to: And it is al&s;o the glory the FATHER promi&s;ed him as the reward of our Redemption, I&s;aiah liii. 12. <HI>Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great, and he &s;hall divide the &s;poil with the &s;trong, becau&s;e he hath poured out his &s;oul unto death.</HI>&mdash;P&s;alm xvi. II. <HI>Thou wilt &s;hew me the path of life, in thy pre&s;ence is fulne&s;s of joy, at thy right hand are plea&s;ures for evermore.</HI> In the pro&s;pect of this recompence he engaged, &s;uffered the cro&s;s, and de&s;pi&s;ed the &s;hame, and is now thus <HI>highly exalted above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but al&s;o in that which is to come, and hath put all things under his feet.</HI>&mdash;</P>

The apo&s;tle <HI>John</HI> long &s;ince beheld him in the &s;ame place and po&s;ture, <HI>Rev.</HI> 5. 1. with all the &s;hining myriads about him, and prai&s;ing of him.</P>
<P>It is then an <HI>exalted</HI> JESUS the prophet &s;aw, and I am now &s;peaking of. <HI>He that was made lower than the angels, is now crowned with glory and honour.</HI> And &s;uch an high prie&s;t the chri&s;tian has, <HI>who is &s;et down on the right hand of the throne of the maje&s;ty in the heavens.</HI> I hope you will all hear the report with plea&s;ure. I am &s;ure, if thro' grace we arrive at the vi&s;ion that comes after, it will never tire us. CHRIST upon the throne is the attractive object of every eye, and engages every heart, angels behold and wonder, and &s;aints adore the ri&s;en GOD: His throne is guarded with legions of ble&s;&s;ed &s;pirits, who with united voices proclaim his excellencies and &s;hout his prai&s;es. They did not di&s;dain to &s;ing his birth to humble &s;hepherds, and now with joy celebrate the glories of his exalta|tion. And the redeemed and perfected &s;pirits unite in the con&s;ort, Rev. 19. beg. <HI>I heard a great voice of much people in heaven, &s;aying, Alleluja,&mdash;for the LORD GOD omnipotent reigneth.</HI> Thus the &s;aints are joyful in glory, the children of Zion <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> joyful in their king, they &s;ing with loud <HI>Ho&s;annah'</HI>s to the &s;on of <HI>David,</HI> the vaults of heaven eccho with &s;ongs of prai&s;e, and the triumph &s;hall never end: <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed are they that dwell in thy courts, they will be &s;till prai&s;ing thee.</HI> Thus the LORD JESUS CHRIST, the eternal SON of GOD, from a low and humble &s;tate on earth, is advanced ro the highe&s;t &s;eat of dignity, and &s;u&s;|tains a po&s;t of the utmo&s;t grandure in the heavenly world: He &s;ets upon a throne of maje&s;ty, that com|mands reverence and honour from us who are now wor&s;hipping at his feet, and from all intelligent beings.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="005326_0012_1016FF7F397219B8">
He &s;ets upon a throne of grace, to which we may may come boldly. The con&s;ideration of his maje&s;ty might make us afraid to draw near and &s;peak to him: This effect it had upon the <HI>prophet,</HI> when he beheld the glory of the LORD, <HI>Then, &s;aid I, wo is me, I am undone:</HI> But he is exalted upon a <HI>mercy-&s;eat,</HI> with a rainbow (an emblem of mercy) about his head: This <HI>invites</HI> the &s;inner to him, <HI>even to his &s;eat,</HI> to lay open his wants, complain of his grievances, and im|plore his compa&s;&s;ion and help. He &s;ets upon a throne of GRACE to give out <HI>pardons</HI> to humble &s;upplicants, and communicate <HI>ble&s;&s;ings</HI> to the poor and needy; and he is as ready to give as we can be to a&s;k them.</P>
<P>He &s;ets upon a throne of <HI>government,</HI> giving out his laws, and demanding our obedience, and ob&s;erv|ing what regards we pay to them, that he may re|ward, or puni&s;h us accordingly: For the throne of <HI>judgment</HI> is al&s;o his; and at his word we either &s;tand or fall.</P>
<P>Having thus &s;poken of the <HI>per&s;on,</HI> the prophet &s;aw upon the throne of glory, high and lifted up:</P>
<P>I proceed to con&s;ider,</P>
<P>II. <HI>The</HI> import <HI>of the</HI> vi&s;ion, <HI>or the</HI> ideas <HI>it &s;erves to convey to us.</HI> And it certainly includes all that is <HI>great</HI> and <HI>good.</HI> The &s;ubject is truly <HI>&s;ublime,</HI> and full of <HI>my&s;tery,</HI> and we may never expect to comprehend it while in our pre&s;ent &s;tate of imperfection, but the advantages of it to us, are &s;urpri&s;ingly great and various.</P>
<P>CHRIST <HI>upon the throne</HI> in our nature, what can be more delightful to hear and contemplate? And how great and boundle&s;s the expectations it rai&s;es in us? He is now ready to all acts of care about his people,
<PB N="14" REF="005326_0013_1016FF821A5B3910">
they are ever under his eye, and within reach of his arm; he is a <HI>&s;un</HI> to <HI>enlighten,</HI> a <HI>&s;hield</HI> to <HI>defend,</HI> and a <HI>fountain</HI> to <HI>&s;upply</HI> them: What more is needful to encourage the active chri&s;tian, to revive the droop|ing &s;aint, or to a&s;toni&s;h the daring &s;inner?

<P>To be particular here,</P>
<P N="1">1. This exaltation of CHRIST &s;peaks the <HI>tran&s;cen|dant dignity</HI> and <HI>excellency</HI> of his <HI>per&s;on,</HI> that he is worthy of the throne he &s;ets on, and qualified for all the great de&s;igns of his advancement. It would be a di&s;honour to the wi&s;dom of GOD to place him there, if he was a mean per&s;on, or an in&s;ufficient ruler: It &s;peaks his <HI>joint-intere&s;t</HI> in the FATHER, the <HI>eternal head</HI> of government, and <HI>onene&s;s</HI> with him in <HI>nature</HI> and <HI>glory:</HI> For GOD never did, or will receive any other into the throne, to &s;hare the dignities and pre|rogatives of it: To <HI>which of the angels &s;aid he at any time, &s;et thou at my right hand?</HI> Nothing like it was ever &s;poken to any of <HI>them.</HI> They are the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> and <HI>pure&s;t</HI> productions of divine light, above man in his original &s;tate of integrity and perfection; but infinite <HI>de&s;cents</HI> below the SON of GOD, and pay their <HI>joint homage</HI> to him in the lowe&s;t po&s;tures of humility and reverence.

<P>Again con&s;ider,</P>
<P>The <HI>account</HI> you mu&s;t quickly give up to the great and impartial JUDGE of the world.

Such loads of guilt will expo&s;e them to a mo&s;t intolerable doom and puni&s;hment in the other world.</P>
<P>Suffer me now to addre&s;s your EXCELLENCY, the honourable BOARD, and the honourable hou&s;e of REPRESENTATIVES, particularly, in a few words.</P>
<P><HI>May it plea&s;e your</HI> EXCELLENCY, whom the LORD <HI>upon the throne</HI> has &s;eated in the <HI>fir&s;t chair</HI> of <HI>dignity</HI> and <HI>power</HI> over us; and we acknowledge and adore his kind hand of providence in it, and that your EXCELLENCY'S admini&s;tration has been to general

<P>Your EXCELLENCY has the honour of being placed at the <HI>head</HI> of a <HI>province,</HI> that has been as remarkable for piety towards GOD, and loyalty to the <HI>crown,</HI> as any one in the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> dominions: A <HI>province</HI> that has been the delight and the care of heaven, and in a very &s;ignal manner &s;mil'd on the pro&s;pered; that it may be &s;aid,&mdash;<HI>Who is like unto thee, Oh people, &s;aved by the</HI> LORD, <HI>the &s;hield of thy help, and the &s;word of thy excellency.</HI> And therefore, SIR, your tender re|gards for us, and endeavour to make us &s;till a more flouri&s;hing and happy people, will be an offering high|ly acceptable to the LORD. A great opportunity is put into your hands to do us good; and we would hope it is becau&s;e GOD <HI>loveth his people</HI> that he has &s;et your EXCELLENCY over us in &s;uch a day and time as this: And that you will be the means of delivering us from the perplexing difficulties we are involved in, particu|larly by an <HI>unhappy Medium,</HI> uncertain as the wind, and fluctuating like the waves of the &s;ea, and which lies at the mercy of every one to ri&s;e or &s;ink at his plea|&s;ure; thro' the <HI>unrighteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> whereof the land mourn|eth; and the cries of many are going up into the ears of the LORD of <HI>Sabaoth.</HI></P>
<P>I would al&s;o humbly a&s;k your EXCELLENCY'S &s;miles upon the COLLEGE, the chief &s;eat of learning among us, the glory of NEW-ENGLAND; and e&s;pecially at &s;uch a time as this, when learning is de&s;pi&s;ed and vilified as a thing prejudicial to the church and &s;tate; whereas it is the honour and &s;afety of both.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="005326_0047_1016FFE39AAA2430">
I would further humbly be&s;eech your EXCELLENCY to u&s;e your be&s;t endeavours and influence at <HI>Home,</HI> to &s;ecure to us the many valuable <HI>privileges</HI> granted us by the ROYAL CHARTER: Your EXCELLENCY'S con|cern and regard for us in the&s;e things, will further en|dear you to us; and as it will render you worthy of the highe&s;t e&s;teem, love and admiration of your people while you live, &s;o your name will be mentioned with honour after your rece&s;s.

<P>I conclude with my earne&s;t wi&s;hes, that the be&s;t of ble&s;&s;ings may de&s;cend &amp; re&s;t upon your EXCELLENCY'S <HI>per&s;on</HI> &amp; <HI>family</HI> to the period of a holy and happy life; and that you may be late tran&s;mitted to the ble&s;&s;ed regions of immortality and glory above, <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
<P>Permit me now to apply my&s;elf to the honourable COUNCIL, and the honourable hou&s;e of REPRESEN|TATIVES.</P>
<P><HI>Gentlemen,</HI></P>
<P>Thro' the good hand of our GOD upon us, you are met together to day to choo&s;e <HI>one branch</HI> of our legi&s;lature. Now there are <HI>two</HI> things that ought to govern you in your <HI>election;</HI> One is, the <HI>ability</HI> or
<PB N="49" REF="005326_0048_1016FFE681D423C0">
<HI>fitne&s;s</HI> of the per&s;on you vote for, that he is a man of good knowledge and wi&s;dom, and a man of integrity; if he is defective in the&s;e, he is certainly de&s;titute of the e&s;&s;ential qualifications for government. The other is this, In your choice have a <HI>principal regard</HI> for the <HI>glory of</HI> CHRIST upon the throne, and the <HI>good of your Country;</HI> not to plea&s;e men, but GOD; not to &s;erve a party-&s;pirit; not to gratify any one's ambition or humour; not from a contracted &s;elfi&s;h principle: I hope, <HI>gentlemen,</HI> you will dete&s;t &s;uch low and &s;ini&s;ter de&s;igns. Be plea&s;ed to think with your&s;elves, before you ca&s;t your <HI>vote,</HI> Will it be an act <HI>plea&s;ing to the Lord</HI> CHRIST, that I hold up my hand, or give my vote for &s;uch a man? What is the <HI>principle</HI> that governs me in it? Is it becau&s;e I think him the mo&s;t capable, and be&s;t di&s;po&s;ed to &s;erve the publick? Or have I &s;omething el&s;e in view? Let not <HI>prejudice</HI> or <HI>affection</HI> turn the &s;cale; and &s;uch a man be neglected or left out, becau&s;e he is not in &s;uch a <HI>&s;cheme</HI> or <HI>party,</HI> tho' otherwi&s;e well qualified; and another take place that is le&s;s worthy, becau&s;e he has &s;uch a turn of thought, or is likely to &s;erve &s;uch a de&s;ign. It was once the complaint of a wi&s;e and political head, <HI>I am not able to bear this people my&s;elf alone;</HI> and it was good policy (and &s;oon became &s;ound divinity) which <HI>Jethro</HI> gave him, <HI>to take wi&s;e men, and under|&s;tanding, and known among the tribes,</HI> and place &s;uch to be rulers. Never did the circum&s;tances of this people call for more of the &s;pirit of <HI>wi&s;dom</HI> and <HI>know|ledge, compa&s;&s;ion</HI> &amp; <HI>integrity,</HI> than at this day: When the tide &s;erves, the wind blows favourably, and all things make for the voyage, a le&s;s degree of &s;kill may po&s;&s;ibly &s;uffice; but it requires an <HI>arti&s;t to &s;teer in a &s;torm.</HI></P>

And, <HI>honour'd Sirs,</HI> after the affair of this day is over, and the &s;everal <HI>branches</HI> of the <HI>legi&s;lature</HI> come to act in concert, it is to be de&s;ired, that you may all approve your&s;elves what by <HI>profe&s;&s;ion</HI> and <HI>character</HI> you are, the <HI>&s;ervants of the Lord</HI> JESUS CHRIST; a title which no man has any cau&s;e to be a&s;hamed of, and which no <HI>angel</HI> or <HI>arch-angel,</HI> but is fond of; and that you manife&s;t your <HI>love</HI> and <HI>loyalty</HI> to him, in a <HI>re&s;olute</HI> and <HI>vigorous oppo&s;ition</HI> to every thing that tends to <HI>ob&s;truct</HI> his intere&s;t, and the flouri&s;hing of religion in the truth and purity of it among us;&mdash;And in a &s;olemn and reverend regard to the DAY, the <HI>hou&s;e</HI> and <HI>wor&s;hip</HI> of GOD, and that a proper care be taken to prevent the great and &s;candalous di&s;orders that &s;ome are chargeable with in the&s;e re&s;pects. I am &s;en&s;ible there are good and whole&s;ome laws provided, to oblige all per&s;ons to <HI>attend</HI> the publick wor&s;hip, and to prevent <HI>unnece&s;&s;ary travels</HI> upon the SABBATH; but how little regard is paid to them? They are every day trampled on, and in the open face of &s;ome in authority, and yet there is little or no notice taken of it: This is <HI>an iniquity to be puni&s;hed by the judges;</HI> but if the civil officer <HI>neglects his duty,</HI> the whole land becomes guilty and mu&s;t &s;uffer for it, for there needs nothing more to make a &s;in <HI>publick,</HI> than that it is connived at by tho&s;e, in who&s;e <HI>power alone</HI> it is to &s;uppre&s;s it.</P>
<P>To draw to a clo&s;e, Let us all <HI>practically acknow|ledge the regency of</HI> CHRIST, and <HI>&s;ubmit</HI> to all his <HI>claims</HI> and <HI>demands</HI> upon us. Our duty herein is too evident to be di&s;puted, and the con&s;equent advantage of it is a dignity and felicity beyond all expre&s;&s;ion, thought or parallel. HEAVEN, with all its charms

Let the&s;e con&s;iderations in&s;pire us with courage and re&s;olution in the &s;ervice of CHRIST; and let them be &s;upporting con&s;iderations to us under all the &s;orrows of the pre&s;ent life. Here the <HI>believer</HI> is in armour and battel with the united powers of &s;in and hell, which furiou&s;ly attack him; and he is almo&s;t worn out with the long and tedious conflict; and here he meets with numberle&s;s cro&s;&s;es and contradicti|ons. Happy they, that are arrived at the heavenly world, and got above the reach of every thing that is grievous: <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed are the dead, that die in the</HI> LORD: There the &s;oul re&s;ts as in its <HI>proper centre,</HI> and de&s;ires nothing more than what it enjoys. But <HI>where &s;hall the ungodly and the &s;inner appear?</HI> CHRIST <HI>upon the throne</HI> has power enough to condemn &amp; puni&s;h them; and will exert his power, as for the <HI>&s;alvation</HI> of his willing people, &s;o for the <HI>de&s;truction</HI> of all his enemies. The &s;inner &s;hall be &s;hut out of his reviving pre&s;ence, &amp; have no part in the honours of his throne, or the joys that flow from it: They that now refu&s;e &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to his <HI>ea&s;y yoke,</HI> he will hereafter break with his <HI>iron rod;</HI> and the <HI>oppo&s;ers of his per&s;on,</HI> &s;hall be the <HI>victims of his ju&s;tice,</HI> and the everla&s;ting monuments of his <HI>wrath</HI> and <HI>vengeance.</HI> Sinners are apt to forget CHRIST in his exalted &s;tate; they look rather upon his pa&s;t life, his low and mean condition, and are fearle&s;s of any

No more is the &s;inner in his hand: He that triumphed over all the powers of hell, when &s;et in battel array again&s;t him, can ea&s;ily conquer the &s;inner when he pre&s;umes to enter the li&s;ts with him. He decks him&s;elf with maje&s;ty and excellency, and arays him&s;elf with glory and beauty; he ca&s;ts abroad the rage of his wrath; beholds every one that is proud, and aba&s;es him; looks upon him, and brings him low, and treads the wicked under his feet; he girdeth him|&s;elf with &s;trength unto battel, pur&s;ues his enemies and overtakes them, as he did the <HI>Egyptian</HI> ho&s;t, in their pur&s;uit of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> neither doth he turn again 'till they are con&s;umed. Sinners are but plotting mi&s;chief a|gain&s;t them&s;elves, and paving the way to their own de&s;truction, when they are regardle&s;s of his laws, and trample his authority under their feet: They may think they act wi&s;ely for them&s;elves; but they &s;hall find it otherwi&s;e, repent their choice and upbraid their folly when it is too late, and they &s;hall come to <HI>drink of the wine of the wrath of GOD, which is pour|ed out without mixture into the cup of his indignation;</HI> and &s;hall be <HI>tormented with fire and brim&s;tone, in the

pre&s;ence of the holy angels, and in the pre&s;ence of the lamb.</HI> This, Oh &s;inner, will be thy fate unle&s;s thou art wi&s;e betimes to make thy peace with the SON of GOD. 'Tis to be earne&s;tly wi&s;hed, that every poor and peri&s;hing &s;oul would be per&s;uaded to &s;ubmit to CHRIST, accept him as his LORD, open his heart, and invite him to come in, and be willing to let <HI>&s;in</HI> and <HI>&s;elf,</HI> and all, go to make room for <HI>him.</HI> And let us all expre&s;s our loyalty to CHRIST by our <HI>&s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to our civil rulers,</HI> who bear the title of GODS, and are inve&s;ted with &s;ometing of <HI>his</HI> authority.

<P>To conclude, Let us all unite in fervent &s;upplica|tion to GOD <HI>upon the throne,</HI> for his ble&s;&s;ing upon the <HI>province,</HI> That he would pardon all the &s;ins of it, according to the greatne&s;s of his mercy; and reform every di&s;order among us: And, that the <HI>hope of I&s;rael</HI> may be our GOD and SAVIOUR, and not as a &s;tranger in our land, or a way-faring man that turns a&s;ide to tarry but for a night; but that he would be always in the mid&s;t of us, and in this day of <HI>war</HI> and <HI>battle</HI> be as a <HI>wall of fire around us,</HI> and <HI>appoint &s;alvation to us for walls and bulwarks:</HI> That he would ble&s;s all <HI>orders</HI> and <HI>degrees</HI> of men among us; and make our
