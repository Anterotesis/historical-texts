<P>HAVING, for &s;ome years, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">et with very great &s;uc|ce&s;s in my productions of the mu&s;ical kind; when I wrote the following Opera, it was with unu&s;ual care and attention; and it was the general opinion of all my friends, &s;ome of whom rank among the be&s;t judges, that of all my trifles, Lionel and Clari&s;&s;a was the mo&s;t pardon|able: a deci&s;ion in its favour, which I was the prouder of, becau&s;e, to the be&s;t of my knowledge, through the whole, I had not borrowed an expre&s;&s;ion, a &s;entiment, or a character, from any dramatic writer extant.</P>
<P>When Mr. GARRICK thought of performing this piece at Drury-lane theatre, he had a new &s;inger to bring out, and every thing po&s;&s;ible for her advantage was to be done; this nece&s;&s;arily occa&s;ioned &s;ome new &s;ongs and airs to be introduced; and other &s;ingers, with voices of a different compa&s;s from tho&s;e who originally acted the parts, occa|&s;ioned &s;till more; by which means the greate&s;t part of the mu&s;ic unavoidably became new. This is the chief, and indeed the only alteration made in the Opera: and even to that, I &s;hould in many places have been forced, much again&s;t my will, had it not given a fre&s;h opportunity to Mr. <HI>Dibden</HI> to di&s;play his admirable talents as a mu&s;ical compo&s;er. And I will be bold to &s;ay, that his airs, &s;e|rious and comic, in this Opera, will appear to no di&s;ad|vantage by being heard with tho&s;e of &s;ome of the greate&s;t ma&s;ters.</P>
<P>The SCHOOL FOR FATHERS is added to the title, becau&s;e the plot in evidently double; and that of Lionel and Clari&s;&s;a alluded to but one part of it, as the readers and &s;pectators will ea&s;ily perceive.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hawth.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why, Sir William, it is a romance, a novel, a plea&s;anter hi&s;tory, by half, than the loves of Dora&s;tus and Faunia; we &s;hall have bellads made of it within the&s;e two months, &s;etting forth, how a young '&s;quire became a &s;erving man of low degree; and it will be &s;tuck up with Margaret's Gho&s;t and the Spani&s;h Lady, again&s;t the walls of every cottage in the country.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Will.</SPEAKER>
<P>But what plea&s;es me be&s;t of all, ma&s;ter Haw|thorn, is the ingenuity of the girl. May I never do an ill turn, when I was called out of the room, and the &s;er|vant &s;aid &s;he wanted to &s;peak with me, if I knew what to make on't: but when the little gip&s;ey took me a&s;ide, and told me her name, and how matters &s;tood, I was quite a&s;toni&s;hed, as a body may &s;ay: and could not be|lieve it, partly; till her young friend, that &s;he is with here a&s;&s;ured me of the truth on't: Indeed, at la&s;t, I began to recollect her face, though I have not &s;et my eyes on her before &s;ince &s;he was the height of a full-grown grey-hound.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Hawth.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, Sir William, your &s;on as yet knows nothing of what has happened, nor of your being come hither: and, if you'll follow my coun&s;el, we'll have &s;ome &s;port with him.&mdash;He and his mi&s;tre&s;s were to meet in the garden this evening by appointment; &s;he's gone to dre&s;s her&s;elf in all her airs: will you let me direct your proceedings in this affair?</P>

<P>With all my heart, ma&s;ter Hawthorn, with all my heart, do what you will with me, &s;ay what you plea&s;e for me; I am &s;o overjoyed, and &s;o happy&mdash;And may I never do an ill turn, but I am very glad to &s;ee you too: ay, and partly as much plea&s;ed at that as any thing el&s;e, for we have been merry together before now, when we were &s;ome years younger: well, and how has the world gone with you, ma&s;ter Hawthorn, &s;ince we &s;aw one another la&s;t?</P>

<P>This is mighty pretty romantic &s;tuff! but you learn it out of your play-books and novels. Girls in my time had other employments; we worked at our needles, and kept our&s;elves from idle thoughts: before I was your age, I had fini&s;hed with my own fingers, a complete &s;et of chairs, and a fire-&s;creen, in tent-&s;titch; four counterpanes in Mar&s;eilles quilting; and the creed and the ten commandments in the hair of our family: it was framed and glaz'd, and hung over the parlour chimney-piece, and your poor dear grandfather was prouder of it than of e'er a picture in his hou&s;e. I ne|ver looked into a book, but when I &s;aid my prayers, except it was the Complete Hou&s;ewife, or the great fa|mily receipt book: whereas you are always at your &s;tu|dies! Ah, I never knew a woman come to good, that was fond of reading.</P>

<HEAD>PROLOGUE.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>WHILE other culprits brave it to the la&s;t;</L>
<L>Nor beg for mercy till the judgment's pa&s;t:</L>
<L>Poets alone, as con&s;cious of their crimes,</L>
<L>Open their trials with imploring rhymes.</L>
<L>Thus cramm'd with flattery and low &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion,</L>
<L>Each trite dull prologue is the bard's petition.</L>
<L>A &s;tale device to calm the critic's fury,</L>
<L>And bribe at once the judges and the jury.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But what avail &s;uch poor repeated arts?</L>
<L>The whimp'ring &s;cribbler ne'er can touch your hearts:</L>
<L>Nor ought an ill-tim'd pity to take place&mdash;</L>
<L>Fa&s;t as they ri&s;e, de&s;troy th' increa&s;ing race:</L>
<L>The vermin el&s;e will run the nation o'er&mdash;</L>
<L>By &s;aving one, you breed a million more.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Tho' di&s;appointed authors rail and rage,</L>
<L>At fancy'd parties, and a &s;en&s;ele&s;s age,</L>
<L>Yet &s;till has ju&s;tice triumph'd on the &s;tage.</L>
<L>Thus &s;peaks and thinks the author of to-day,</L>
<L>And &s;aying this, has little more to &s;ay.</L>
<L>He a&s;ks no friend his partial zeal to &s;how,</L>
<L>Nor fears the groundle&s;s cen&s;ures of a foe;</L>
<L>He knows no friend&s;hip can protect the fool,</L>
<L>Nor will an audience be a party's tool.</L>
<L>'Tis incon&s;i&s;tent with a free-born &s;pirit,</L>
<L>To &s;ide with folly, or to injure merit.</L>
<L>By your deci&s;ion he mu&s;t fall or &s;tand,</L>
<L>Nor, tho' he feels the la&s;h, will blame the hand.</L>

<L>We give a <HI>Fable</HI> for the <HI>Epilogue.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>AN <HI>a&s;s</HI> there was, our author bid me &s;ay,</L>
<L>Who needs mu&s;t write&mdash;he did&mdash;and wrote a play.</L>
<L>The parts were ca&s;t to various bea&s;ts and fowl:</L>
<L>Their &s;tage a barn;&mdash;the manager an owl!</L>
<L>The hou&s;e was cramm'd at &s;ix, with friends and foes;</L>
<L>Rakes, wits, and critics, citizens and beaux.</L>
<L>The&s;e characters appear'd in different &s;hapes</L>
<L>Of tigers, foxes, hor&s;es, bulls and apes;</L>
<L>With others too, of lower rank and &s;tation:&mdash;</L>
<L>A perfect ab&s;tract of the brute creation!</L>
<L>Each, as he felt, mark'd out the author's faults,</L>
<L>And thus the <HI>connoi&s;&s;eurs</HI> expre&s;s'd their thoughts.</L>
<L>The <HI>critic curs</HI> fir&s;t &s;narl'd&mdash;the rules are broke!</L>
<L>Time, place, and action &s;acrific'd to joke!</L>
<L>The <HI>goats</HI> cry'd out, 'twas formal, dull, and cha&s;te&mdash;</L>
<L>Not writ for bea&s;ts of gallantry and ta&s;te!</L>
<L>The <HI>horned-cattle</HI> were in piteous taking,</L>
<L>At fornification, rapes and cuckold making!</L>
<L>The <HI>tigers</HI> &s;wore, he wanted fire and pa&s;&s;ion.</L>
<L>The <HI>apes</HI> condemn'd&mdash;becau&s;e it was the fa&s;hion!</L>
<L>The generous <HI>&s;teeds</HI> allow'd him proper merit:</L>
<L>Here mark'd his faults, and there approv'd his &s;pirit.</L>
<L>While <HI>brother-bards</HI> bray'd forth with u&s;ual &s;pleen,</L>
<L>And, as they heard, exploded every &s;cene.</L>
<L>When <HI>reynard</HI>'s thoughts were a&s;k<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d, the &s;hrugging &s;age,</L>
<L>Fam'd for hypocri&s;y, and worn with age,</L>
<L>Condemn'd <HI>the &s;hamele&s;s licence of the &s;tage!</HI></L>
<L>At which the <HI>monkey</HI> &s;kipp'd from box to box,</L>
<L>And whi&s;per'd round the judgment of the <HI>fox:</HI></L>
<L>Abus'd the moderns, talk'd of <HI>Rome</HI> and <HI>Greece!</HI></L>
<L>Bilk'd every box-keeper; and damn'd the piece.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now every fable has a moral to it&mdash;</L>
<L>Be churchman, &s;tate&s;man, any thing&mdash;but poet.</L>
<L>In law, or phy&s;ic, quack in what you will;</L>
<L>Cant, and grimace conceal the want of &s;kill!</L>
<L>Secure in the&s;e, his gravity may pa&s;s&mdash;</L>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Clar.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! the greate&s;t of all inducements, curio&s;ity. Let me a&s;&s;ure you, a woman's &s;ure&s;t hold over a man is to keep him in uncertainty.

<P>I care not how &s;oon. I long to meet with &s;uch a fellow. Our modern beaux are &s;uch jointed babies in love, they have no feeling.

They are not worthy even our di&s;plea&s;ure; and, in &s;hort, abu&s;ing them is but &s;o much ill-nature merely thrown away. But the man of &s;en&s;e, who values him&s;elf upon his high abilities: or the man of wit, who thinks a woman be|neath his conver&s;ation&mdash;to &s;ee &s;uch the &s;ubjects of our power, the &s;laves of our frowns and &s;miles is glo|rious indeed!</P>
