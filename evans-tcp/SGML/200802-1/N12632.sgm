<BIBL>GAL. IV.26 and 31.</BIBL>
<Q>But Jeru&s;alem which is above is free, which is the mother of us all. So then, Brethren, we are not children of the bond woman but of the free.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IT is common for the in&s;pired wri|ters to &s;peak of the go&s;pel di&s;pen&s;a|tion in terms applicable to the pre|&s;ent world, e&s;pecially when they view it in compari&s;on with the law of Mo&s;es. In this light, they con&s;ider the church of God, and good men upon earth, as members of the church and family of God above, and liken the liberty of chri|&s;tians, to that of the citizens of the hea|venly Zion.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="015956_0005_0F9B23DDB973BF98">WE doubt not, but the Jeru&s;alem above, the heavenly &s;ociety, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the noble&s;t liberty to a degree of perfection, of which, the human mind can have no adequate conception, in the pre&s;ent &s;tate. The want of that knowledge and rectitude they are endowed with above, renders liberty and government &s;o imperfect here below.</P>
<P>NEXT to the liberty of Heaven, is that which the &s;ons of God, the heirs of glory po&s;&s;e&s;s in this life, in which they are freed from the bondage of corruption, the ty|ranny of evil lu&s;ts and pa&s;&s;ions, de&s;cribed by the apo&s;tle, <HI>by being made free from &s;in, and becoming the &s;ervants of God.</HI> The&s;e kinds of liberty are &s;o nearly related, that the latter is con&s;idered as a &s;ure pledge of the former, and therefore, all good men, all true believers, in a &s;pecial &s;en&s;e are children of the free woman, heirs of the promi&s;e. This religious or &s;piritual liber|ty mu&s;t be accounted the greate&s;t happi|ne&s;s of man, con&s;idered in a private capa|city.</P>
<P>BUT con&s;idering our&s;elves here, as con|nected in civil &s;ociety, and members one of another, we mu&s;t in this view, e&s;teem civil liberty as the greate&s;t of all human ble&s;|&s;ings.
<PB N="7" REF="015956_0006_0F9B23DE78ABDBB8">This admits of different degrees, nearly proportioned to the morals, capaci|ty, and principles of a people, and the mode of government they adopt. For like the enjoyment of other ble&s;&s;ings, it &s;uppo&s;es an aptitude, or ta&s;te in the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;or. Hence, a people formed upon the morals and principles of the go&s;pel are ca|pacitated to enjoy the highe&s;t degree of ci|vil liberty, and will really enjoy it, unle&s;s prevented by force or fraud.</P>
<P>MUCH depends upon the mode and ad|mini&s;tration of civil government, to com|plete the ble&s;&s;ing of liberty; for altho' the be&s;t po&s;&s;ible plan of government, ne|ver can give an ignorant and vicious people, the true enjoyment of liberty, yet a State may be en&s;laved, tho' its inhabitants in ge|neral, may be knowing, virtuous and heroic.</P>
<P>THE voice of rea&s;on, and the voice of God, both teach us, that the great object, or end of government, is, the public good. Nor is there le&s;s certainty in determining, that a free and righteous government ori|ginates from the people and is under their direction and controul, and therefore a free popular model of government, of the repub|lican kind, may be judged the mo&s;t friendly
<PB N="8" REF="015956_0007_0F9B23DF39DA7878">
to the rights and liberties of the people, and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> conducive to the public welfare.</P>
<P>ON account of the infinite diversity of opinions, and intere&s;ts, as well as for other weighty rea&s;ons, a government altogether popular, &s;o as to have the deci&s;ion of ca&s;es by a&s;&s;emblies of the body of the people, cannot be thought &s;o eligible; nor yet, that a people &s;hould delegate their power and authority to one &s;ingle man, or to one body of men, or indeed to any hands what|ever, excepting for a &s;hort term of time.</P>
<P>A FORM of government may be &s;o con&s;tituted, as to have u&s;eful checks in the legi&s;lature, and yet capable of acting with union, vigour and di&s;patch, with a repre|&s;entation equally proportioned, pre&s;erving the legi&s;lative and executive branches di&s;|tinct, and the great e&s;&s;entials of liberty be pre&s;erved and &s;ecured. To adju&s;t &s;uch a model,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">THE form or con&s;titution of government, that has been &s;ubmitted to the people of this State, &s;o amply &s;ecures the e&s;&s;entials of liberty, places and keeps the power &s;o intirely in the hands of the people, is &s;o conci&s;e and explicit, and makes &s;uch an ea&s;y &s;tep from the old to the new form, that it may ju&s;tly be con&s;idered as a high evidence of the abilities of its compilers, and if it &s;hould not be complied with, it is very probable we never &s;hall obtain a better</NOTE> is acknowledged to be a nice and
<PB N="9" REF="015956_0008_0F9B23E01378C1A8">
difficult matter: and when adju&s;ted, to render it re&s;pectable, permanent and quiet, the circum&s;tances of the State, and the ca|pacities and morals both of rulers and peo|ple, are not only of high importance but of ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity.</P>
<P>IT by no means becomes me to a&s;&s;ume the airs of a dictator, by deliniating a mo|del of government; but &s;hall a&s;k the can|did attention of this A&s;&s;embly, to &s;ome things re&s;pecting a State, its rulers and in|habitants, of high importance and nece&s;&s;i|ty to the being and continuance of &s;uch a free and righteous government as we wi&s;h for our&s;elves and po&s;terity, and hope by the ble&s;&s;ing of God to have e'er long e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>
<P>IN this view, it is obvious to ob&s;erve, that a &s;pirit of liberty &s;hould in general prevail among a people: Their minds &s;hould be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with a &s;en&s;e of its worth and nature.</P>
<P>FACTS and ob&s;ervation abundantly teach us, that the minds of a community, as well as of individuals, are &s;ubject to dif|ferent and various ca&s;ts and impre&s;&s;ions. The inhabitants of large and opulent em|pires
<PB N="10" REF="015956_0009_0F9B23E0B8A841D8">and kingdoms, are often intirely lo&s;t to a &s;en&s;e of liberty; in which ca&s;e they become an ea&s;y prey to u&s;urpers and ty|rants.</P>
<P>WHERE the &s;pirit of liberty is found in its genuine vigour, it produces its ge|nuine effects, urging to the greate&s;t vigi|lance and exertions, it will &s;urmount great difficulties; that it is no ea&s;y matter to deceive or conquer a people determined to be free. The exertions and effects of this great &s;pirit in our land, have already been &s;uch as may well a&s;toni&s;h the world. And &s;o long as it generally prevails, it will be quiet with no &s;pecies of govern|ment, but what befriends and protects it. Its jealou&s;y for its &s;afety, may &s;ometimes appear as if verging to faction; but it means well, and can never endanger a state, unle&s;s its root and &s;ource is corrupted.</P>
<P>FREE republican governments have been objected to, as if expo&s;ed to factions from an exce&s;s of liberty: The Grecian &s;tates are mentioned for a proof, and is is allowed that the hi&s;tory of &s;ome of the&s;e commonwealths, is little el&s;e but a narration of factions. But it is ju&s;tly denied, that the true &s;pirit of liberty pro|duced the&s;e effects.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="015956_0010_0F9B23E179655FE8">VIOLENT and oppo&s;ing parties &s;haking the pillars of the &s;tate, may ari&s;e under the be&s;t forms of government. A govern|ment from various cau&s;es may be thrown into convul&s;ions, like the Roman &s;tate in its latter periods, and like that, may die of the malady. But the evils which hap|pen in a State, are not always to be char|ged upon its government, much le&s;s upon one of the noble&s;t principles that can dwell in the human brea&s;t. There are di&s;ea&s;es in government, like &s;fome in the human body, that lay undi&s;covered 'till they be|come wholly incurable.</P>
<P>THE baneful effects of exorbitant wealth, the lu&s;t of power, and other evil pa&s;&s;ions, are &s;o inimical to a free, righte|ous government, and find &s;uch an ca&s;y ac|ce&s;s to the human mind, that it is difficult, if po&s;&s;ible, to keep up the &s;pirit of good government, unle&s;s the &s;pirit of liberty pre|vails in the State. This &s;pirit like other generous growths of nature, flouri&s;hes be&s;t in its native &s;oil. It has been ingra&s;ted at one time and another in various countries; in America, it &s;hoots up and grows as in its natural &s;oil. Recollecting our pious ance&s;tors, the fir&s;t settlers of the country, nor shall we look for ance&s;try beyond that
<PB N="12" REF="015956_0011_0F9B23E2F3725960">
period, and we may &s;ay in the mo&s;t literal &s;en&s;e, we are children, not of the bond woman, but of the free. It may hence well be expected, that the exertions and effects of American liberty &s;hould be more vigorous and compleat. It has the mo&s;t to fear from ignorance and avarice; for it is no uncommon thing for a people to loo&s;e &s;ight of their liberty, in the eager pur&s;uit of wealth, as the States of Holland have done. And it will always be as ea&s;y to rob an ignorant people of their liberty, as to pick the pockets of a blind man.</P>
<P>THE &s;lavery of a people is generally founded in ignorance, of &s;ome kind or another; and there are not wanting &s;uch facts as abundantly prove, the human mind may be &s;o &s;unk and deba&s;ed thro' igno|rance and its natural effects, as even to adore its en&s;laver, and ki&s;s its chains.</P>
<P>HENCE, knowledge and learning may well be con&s;idered, as mo&s;t e&s;&s;entially re|qui&s;ite to a free, righteous government. A republican government and &s;cience, mu|tually promote and &s;upport each other.</P>
<P>GREAT literary acquirements are in|deed the lot of but few, because but few

in a community have ability and opportu|nity to pur&s;ue the paths of &s;cience. But a certain degree of knowledge is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to be diffu&s;ed through a &s;tate, for the pre&s;ervation of its liberties and the quiet of government.</P>
<P>EVERY kind of u&s;eful knowledge will be carefully encouraged and promoted by the rulers of a free State, unle&s;s they &s;hould happen to be men of ignorance them|&s;elves; in which ca&s;e they and the commu|nity will be in danger of &s;haring the fate of blind guides, and their followers. The education of youth by in&s;tructors pro|perly qualified,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The want of proper in&s;tructors and a proper method of in&s;tructing, are the rea&s;ons that what we call common education, or &s;chool|learning, is generally &s;o imperfect among us. Youth &s;hould always be taught by &s;trict rule, in reading, writing and &s;peaking, and &s;o in all parts of their education. By this means, the advantages of their education will commonly increa&s;e with their age; that by a little appli|cation in their riper years, per&s;ons may rai&s;e a u&s;eful &s;uper &s;tructure from a &s;mall foundation that was well laid at &s;chool, in their earlier days. It would be of eminent &s;ervice, if in|&s;tructors would more generally ende vour to fix in the minds of their &s;cholars, the rules of reading, of &s;pelling, of writing, or of whatever branch of knowledge they teach.</NOTE> the e&s;tabli&s;hment of &s;o|cieties for u&s;eful arts and &s;ciences, the
<PB N="14" REF="015956_0013_0F9B23E3BA8C9238">
encouragement of per&s;ons of &s;uperior abi|lities will always command the attention of wi&s;e rulers.</P>
<P>The late times of our glorious &s;truggle have not indeed been favorable to the cau&s;e of education in general; though much u&s;eful knowledge of the geography of our country, of the &s;cience of arms, of our abilities and &s;trength, and of our na|tural rights and liberties, has been ac|quired; great improvements and di&s;cove|ries have al&s;o been made in &s;everal kinds of manufactory. But our &s;ecurity and the public welfare requires yet greater ex|ertions, to promote education and u&s;eful knowledge. Mo&s;t of the internal diffi|culties of a State, commonly ari&s;e from ignorance, that general &s;ource of error. The growls of avarice and cur&s;es of clowns, will generally be heard, when the public liberty and &s;afety call for more generous and co&s;tly exertions. Indeed, we may ne|ver expect to find the marks of public vir|tue, the efforts of heroi&s;m, or any kind of noblene&s;s, in a man who has no idea of glory and excellency, but what he hoard<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> up in his barn, or ties up in his pur&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="015956_0014_0F9B23E5397219B8">IT is readily allowed there has not been wanting &s;tate&s;men and heroes, of the ge|nerous growth of nature; though in&s;tan|ces of this &s;ort are not &s;o common. But if the&s;e had been favored with the im|provements of arts, they would have appeared to much greater advantage, and with brighter lu&s;tre.</P>
<P>Nothing within the compa&s;s of human ability, is of that real weight and impor|tance as the education of youth, the pro|pagation of knowledge. De&s;poti&s;m and tyranny want nothing but wealth and force; but liberty and order are &s;upported by knowledge and virtue.</P>
<P>I SHALL al&s;o mention the love of our country, or public virtue, as another e&s;&s;en|tial &s;upport of good government and the public liberties. No model of govern|ment whatever can equal the importance of this principle, nor afford proper &s;afety and &s;ecurity to the State without it. Its object being the approbation of con|&s;cience, and its motive to exertion being the public welfare; hence it can only dwell in &s;uperior minds, elevated above private intere&s;t and &s;elfi&s;h views. It does that for the public which dome&s;tic affec|tion
<PB N="16" REF="015956_0015_0F9B23E64CFBE210">
does among real friends; but like other excellencies is more frequently pre|tended to than po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>IN the antient Roman republic, it was the life and &s;oul of the State which rai&s;ed it to all its glory, being always awake to the public defence and good: And in every State it mu&s;t under providence, be the &s;upport of government, the guardian of liberty, or no human wi&s;dom or policy can &s;upport and pre&s;erve them. Civil &s;o|ciety cannot be maintained without ju&s;|tice, benevolence, and the &s;ocial virtues. Even the government of the Jeru&s;alem above, could not render a vicious and abandoned people quiet and happy. The children of the bond woman, &s;laves to vice, never can be free. If the rea&s;on of the mind, man's immediate rule of con|duct, is in bondage to corruption, he is verily the wor&s;t of &s;laves.</P>
<P>PUBLIC &s;pirit, through human imper|fection, is in danger of degenerating to &s;elfi&s;h pa&s;&s;ion, which has a malignant in|fluence on public mea&s;ures. This danger is the greater, becau&s;e the corruption is not commonly owned, nor &s;oon di&s;cerned. Such as are the mo&s;t di&s;ea&s;ed with it, are apt to be the mo&s;t in&s;en&s;ible to their er|ror.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="015956_0016_0F9B23E706D04340">THE exorbitant wealth of individuals, has a mo&s;t baneful influence on public vir|tue; and therefore &s;hould be carefully guarded again&s;t. It is, however, acknow|ledged to be a difficult mattter, to &s;ecure a State from evils and mi&s;chiefs from this quarter; becau&s;e as the world goes, and is like to go, wealth and riches will have their commanding influence. The public intere&s;t being a remoter object than that of &s;elf, hence per&s;ons in power, are &s;o ge|nerally di&s;po&s;ed to turn it to their own advantage. A wicked rich man, we &s;ee &s;oon corrupts a whole neighbourhood, and a few of them will poi&s;on the morals of a whole community.</P>
<P>THIS &s;overeign power of intere&s;t, &s;eems to have been much the &s;ource of modern politicks abroad, and has given birth to &s;uch maxims of policy as the&s;e, viz. "that the wealth of a people is their true&s;t ho|nor,"&mdash; "that every man has his price"&mdash; "that the longe&s;t pur&s;e, and not the long|e&s;t &s;word, will finally be victorious". But we tru&s;t and hope that American virtue, will be &s;ufficient to convince the world, that &s;uch maxims are ba&s;e, are ill-founded, and altogether unfit and improper, to influ|ence and lead in government.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="015956_0017_0F9B23E77A5EA468">IN the infancy of States, there is not commonly &s;o much danger of the&s;e mi&s;|chiefs, becau&s;e the love of liberty and public virtue, are then more general and vigorous. But the danger is apt to increa&s;e, with the wealth of individuals.</P>
<P>THESE ob&s;ervations are founded upon &s;uch well-known facts, that the rulers of a free &s;tate have &s;ufficient warning to guard again&s;t the evils. The general diffu&s;ion of knowledge is the be&s;t pre&s;ervative again&s;t them, and the likelie&s;t method to beget and increa&s;e that public virtue, which, under God, will prove like the promi&s;es of the go&s;|pel, an impregnable bulwark to the State.</P>
<P>I MUST not forget to mention religion both in rulers and people as of the highe&s;t importance to the public. This is the mo&s;t &s;acred principle that can dwell in the human brea&s;t. It is of the highe&s;t im|portance to men; the mo&s;t perfective of the human &s;oul. The truths of the go&s;|pel are the mo&s;t pure; its motives the mo&s;t noble and animating, and its com|forts the mo&s;t &s;upporting to the mind.</P>
<P>THE importance of religion to civil &s;o|ciety and government, is great indeed, as
<PB N="19" REF="015956_0018_0F9B23E838B6D068">it keeps alive the be&s;t &s;en&s;e of moral ob|ligation, a matter of &s;uch exten&s;ive utility, e&s;pecially in re&s;pect to an oath, which is one of the principal in&s;truments of govern|ment. The fear and reverence of God, and the terrors of eternity, are the mo&s;t powerful re&s;traints upon the minds of men. And hence it is of &s;pecial impor|tance in a free government, the &s;pirit of which being always friendly to the &s;acred rights of con&s;cience, it will hold up the go&s;pel as the great rule of faith and practice.</P>
<P>ESTABLISHED modes and u&s;ages in religion, more e&s;pecially the &s;tated public wor&s;hip of God, &s;o generally form the principles, and manners of a people, that changes, or alterations in the&s;e, e&s;pecially, when nearly conformed to the &s;pirit and &s;implicity of the go&s;pel, may well be e&s;teemed very dangerous experiments in government. For this, and other rea&s;ons, the thoughtful and wi&s;e among us, tru&s;t that our civil fathers, from a regard to go&s;pel wor&s;hip, and the con&s;titution of the&s;e churches, will carefully pre&s;erve them; and at all times, guard again&s;t every innovation, that might tend to over|&s;et the public wor&s;hip of God, though &s;uch innovations may be urged from the mo&s;t foaming zeal. Per&s;ons of a gloomy,
<PB N="20" REF="015956_0019_0F9B23E8F8C9BC28">
gho&s;tly and my&s;tic ca&s;t, ab&s;orbed in vi&s;io|nary &s;cenes, de&s;erve but little notice in matters, either of religion or government. Let the re&s;traints of religion, once be bro|ken down, as they infallibly would be, by leaving the &s;ubject of public wor&s;hip, to the humors of the multitude, and we might well defy all human wi&s;dom and power, to &s;upport &amp; pre&s;erve order and government in the State. Human conduct and characters, can never be better formed, than upon the principles of our holy religion; they give the ju&s;te&s;t &s;ence, the mo&s;t adequate views of the duties between rulers and people, and are the be&s;t principles in the world to carry the ruler through the duties of his &s;tation. And in ca&s;e a &s;eries of faithful &s;ervices, &s;hould be followed with popular cen&s;ure, as may be the ca&s;e, yet the religious ruler will find the approbation of his con&s;cience, a noble reward.</P>
<P>MANY other things might be mention|ed, as circum&s;tances much in favor of a free government and public liberty, as, where the inhabitants of a State, can in general give their &s;uffrages in per&s;on; and men of abilities are di&s;per&s;ed in the &s;everal parts of a State, capable of public office and &s;tation; e&s;pecially, if there is a gene|ral
<PB N="21" REF="015956_0020_0F9B23E9B89686C8">
di&s;tribution of property, and the land|ed intere&s;t not engro&s;&s;ed by a few, but po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the inhabitants in general thro the State; things of this nature wear a kind a&s;pect. But for the pre&s;ervation and permanence of the State, it is of &s;till higher importance that its internal &s;trength be &s;upported upon the great pillars of capacity, defence and union. The full liberty of the pre&s;s, that eminent in&s;trument of pro|moting knowledge, and great palladium of the public liberty, being enjoyed; the learned profe&s;&s;ions directed to the public good; the great principles of legi&s;lation and government; the great examples and truths of hi&s;tory: the maxims of gene|rous and upright policy, and the &s;everer truths of philo&s;ophy, inve&s;tigated and ap|prehended by a general application to books, and by ob&s;ervation and experiment, are means by which the capacity of a &s;tate will be &s;trong and re&s;pectable, and the number of &s;uperior minds will be daily encrea&s;ing.</P>
<P>STRENGTH, courage and military di&s;|cipline, being, under God, the great de|fence of a &s;tate, as the&s;e are cultivated and improved, the public defence will increa&s;e: And, if there is added to the&s;e, a general
<PB N="22" REF="015956_0021_0F9B23EA789CF350">union, a &s;pirit of harmony, the internal &s;trength and beauty of the &s;tate will be great indeed.</P>
<P>THE variety and freedom of opinion is apt to check the union of a free &s;tate; and in ca&s;e the union be interrupted merely from the freedom of opinion, con|te&s;ting for real rights and priviledges, the &s;tate and its government may &s;till be &s;trong and &s;ecure, as was in fact the ca&s;e in an|cient Rome, in the more di&s;intere&s;ted peri|ods of that republic. But if parties and factions ari&s;ing from fal&s;e ambition, avarice or revenge, run high, they endanger the &s;tate, which was the ca&s;e in the latter peri|ods of the republic of Rome. Hence, the parties in a free &s;tate, if aimed at the pub|lic liberty and welfare, are &s;alutary; but if &s;elfi&s;h intere&s;t and views are their &s;ource, they are both dangerous and de&s;tructive.</P>
<P>THE language of ju&s;t complaint, the voice of real grievance, in mo&s;t ca&s;es, may ea&s;ily be di&s;tingui&s;hed from the meer cla|mor of &s;elfi&s;h, turbulent and di&s;appointed men. The ear of a righteous government will always be open to the former, its hand with wi&s;dom and prudence will &s;up|pre&s;s the latter: And &s;ince pa&s;&s;ion is as
<PB N="23" REF="015956_0022_0F9B23EB38E892B0">natural to men as rea&s;on, much di&s;cretion &s;hould be u&s;ed to calm and quiet di&s;affected minds. <HI>Coercives</HI> in government, &s;hould al|ways be held as very dangerous political phy|&s;ic; &s;uch as have gone into the practice have commonly either killed or lo&s;t their patients.</P>
<P>A &s;pirit of union is certainly a mo&s;t happy omen in a &s;tate, and upon righteous principles &s;hould be cultivated and impro|ved with diligence. It greatly &s;trengthens public mea&s;ures, and gives them vigor and di&s;patch; &s;o that but &s;mall &s;tates when united, have done wonders in defending their liberties again&s;t powerful monarchs. Of this we have a memorable example in the little &s;tate of Athens, whicn de&s;troyed the fleet of Xerxes, con&s;i&s;ting of a thou|&s;and &s;hips, and drove Darius with his ar|my of three hundred thou&s;and men out of Greece.</P>
<P>IT mu&s;t not be forgotten, that much, very much depends upon rulers, to render a free government, quiet, permanent and re&s;|pectful; they ought therefore in an eminent degree to po&s;&s;e&s;s tho&s;e virtues and abilities which are the &s;ource and &s;upport of &s;uch a government.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="015956_0023_0F9B23EBF8E988C8">THE modern maxims of policy abroad, the ba&s;e arts of bribery and corruption, of intrigue and di&s;&s;imulation, will &s;oon be productive of evils and mi&s;chiefs in the &s;tate. And &s;ince a corruption of man|ners almo&s;t nece&s;&s;arily follows a corrup|tion of policy, the rulers of a free &s;tate ought to be influenced by the mo&s;t gene|rous and righteous principles and views. Ignorant and de&s;igning men &s;hould be kept from public offices in the &s;tate, as the former will be dupes to the ambitious, and the latter will be likely to prove the in&s;truments of di&s;cord.</P>
<P>MEN upon their fir&s;t promotion, com|monly act and &s;peak with an air of meek|ne&s;s and diffidence, which however, may con&s;i&s;t with firmne&s;s and re&s;olution. The practice of power is apt to di&s;&s;ipate the&s;e humble airs; for this and other rea&s;ons, it may generally be be&s;t not to continue per&s;ons a long time in places of honor and emolument.</P>
<P>THE qualities of a good ruler, may be e&s;timated from the nature of a free govern|ment. Power being a delegation, and all delegated power being in its nature &s;ubor|dinate and limited, hence rulers are but

tru&s;tees, and government a tru&s;t; there|fore fidelity is a prime qualification in a ruler; this joined with good natural and acquired abilities, goes far to compleat the character.</P>
<P>NATURAL di&s;po&s;ition that is benevo|lent and kind, embelli&s;hed with the grace|ful modes of addre&s;s, agreeably &s;trike the mind, and hence in preference to greater real abilities will commonly carry the votes of a people. It is however a truth in fact, that per&s;ons of this ca&s;t are &s;ubject to a degree of indolence, from which ari&s;es an aver&s;ion to tho&s;e &s;tudies which form the great and active patriot. It is al&s;o a temper liable to that flexibility which may prove prejudicial to the &s;tate.</P>
<P>A GOOD acquaintance with mankind, a knowledge of the leading pa&s;&s;ions and principles of the human mind, is of high importance in the character before us. For common and well known truths and real facts, ought to determine us in hu|man matters. We &s;hould take mankind as they are, and not as they ought to be, or would be, if they were perfect in wi&s;|dom and virtue. So, in our &s;earches for truth and knowledge, and in our labors for
<PB N="26" REF="015956_0025_0F9B23EE1C202A30">
improvement, we &s;hould keep within the ken or compa&s;s of the human mind. The welfare of the public, being the great ob|ject of the rulers views they ought of con&s;equence, to be di&s;cerning in the times, always awake and watchful, to the public danger and defence.</P>
<P>AND in order that government may &s;upport a proper air of dignity, and com|mand re&s;pect, the ruler &s;hould engage in public matters, and perform the duties of his office, with gravity and &s;olemnity of &s;pirit; with wi&s;dom he will deliberate upon pub|lic mea&s;ures, and tenacious of a well form|ed purpo&s;e and de&s;ign, he will pur&s;ue it with an inflexible &s;tability.</P>
<P>POLITICAL knowledge, a &s;en&s;e of honor, an open and generous mind, it is confe&s;&s;ed, will direct and urge a ruler to actions and exertions, beneficial to the State. And, if added to the&s;e, he has a principle of religion, and the fear of God, it will, in the be&s;t manner, fit him for the whole cour&s;e or allotted duty. The great|e&s;t re&s;traints, the noble&s;t motives, and the be&s;t &s;upports ari&s;e from our holy religion. The pious ruler, is by far, the mo&s;t likely to promote the public good. His

example will have the mo&s;t happy influ|ence; his public devotions will not only be acts of wor&s;hip and homage to God, but al&s;o of charity to men. Superior to ba&s;e pa&s;&s;ions, and little re&s;entments, undi&s;|mayed by danger, not awed by threat|nings, he guides the helm in &s;torm and tempe&s;t, and is ready if called in provi|dence, to &s;acrifice his life for his country's good. Mo&s;t of all concerned, to approve him&s;elf to his God, he avoids the &s;ubtle arts of chicanery, which are productive of &s;o much mi&s;chief in a State; exerci&s;ing a con&s;cience void of offence, he has food to eat which the world knows not of, and in the hour of his death, that &s;olemn period, has a hope and confidence in God, which is better than a thou&s;and worlds.</P>
<P>A STATE, and its inhabitants thus cir|cum&s;tanced, in re&s;pect to government, principle, morals, capacity, union and ru|lers, make up the mo&s;t &s;triking portrait, the livelie&s;t emblem of the Jeru&s;alem that is above, that this world can afford.</P>

One common cau&s;e, one common danger, and one common intere&s;t has united and urged us to the mo&s;t vigorous exertions. From &s;mall beginnings, from great weakne&s;s, impelled from nece&s;&s;ity, and the tyrant's rod, but following the guidance of heaven, we have gone thro' a cour&s;e of noble and heroic actions, with minds &s;uperior to the mo&s;t virulent menaces, and to all the hor|rors of war, for we tru&s;ted in the God of our fore-fathers.
