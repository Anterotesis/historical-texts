<Q><BIBL><HI>ISAIAH LII. 9&mdash;10.</HI></BIBL>
<P>Break forth into Joy, &s;ing together ye wa&s;te Places of Jeru&s;alem; for the Lord hath comforted his People: He hath redeemed Jeru&s;alem: The Lord hath made bare his holy Arm in the Eyes of all Nations, and all the Ends of the Earth &s;hall &s;ee the Salvation of our God.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>GREAT and incomprehen&s;ible is Jehovah the &s;overeign of heaven and earth; his greatne&s;s is un&s;earchable, nor can the brighte&s;t Seraph in his pre&s;ence declare the full extent of his wi&s;dom, power and goodne&s;s. Yet part of his ways are made known to us both in his word and in his works: He hath been di&s;|playing the moral perfections of his nature from the moment he fir&s;t &s;pake into being moral creatures, whether angels or men, down to the pre&s;ent day. The divine di&s;pen&s;ations towards the angelic hier|archy, tho&s;e &s;ublimer &s;pirits who mini&s;tered before the throne of God, declare the glorious excellence and infinite perfection of their &s;upreme Lord: Some indeed are the awful monuments of divine ju&s;tice and omnipotence, being, for their di&s;obedi|ence, "re&s;erved in chains under darkne&s;s unto the judgment of the great day;" others in loud acclamations of prai&s;e a&s;cribe righeou&s;ne&s;s un|to
<PB N="6" REF="009403_0004_0F7403C348084640">
the Lord, "and cry one to another, &s;aying, holy, holy, holy is the Lord God almighty."</P>
<P>But we are more acquainted with the divine di&s;pen&s;ations towards the &s;ons of <HI>Adam,</HI> and much more intere&s;ted in the di&s;coveries which God has made of his being and perfections in relation to the human, than the angelic nature. When we reflect on the divine memoirs as they re&s;pect our &s;inful race, what abundant rea&s;on have we to break forth into joy, and &s;ing anthems of prai&s;e to him who hath vi&s;ited us with his mercy, after we had &s;hamefully violated the mo&s;t &s;acred engage|ments, broke his covenant, and ju&s;tly might have been ca&s;t off forever! All prai&s;e to him who laid the great plan of our redemption, and gave early intimations of his grace, and promi&s;ed the deliverer in the very &s;entence he pronounced on our arch foe: All prai&s;e to <HI>him</HI> who has made all things &s;ub&s;erve this mo&s;t gracious de&s;ign, in which every moral perfection of the deity is illu&s;trated; and none can &s;ay whether his ju&s;tice or his mercy, his holine&s;s or his love &s;hine with more di&s;tingui&s;hed lu&s;tre. All prai&s;e to <HI>him</HI> who has planned and executed this gracious method in a manner every way uniform and con&s;i&s;tent, that all the parts which have been di&s;clo&s;ed in the re&s;pective periods of the church, coincide to the grand purpo&s;e, and form one beautiful <HI>whole.</HI></P>
<P>Known unto the Lord are all his works from the beginning, he hath directed the whole to promote the honour of his great name and the welfare of his church, in a manner which &s;peaks his univer&s;al government, and declares that he is the <HI>mo&s;t high</HI> over all the earth.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="009403_0005_0F7403C3F9991630">Thus, his di&s;pen&s;ations to the <HI>I&s;raelites,</HI> were de|&s;igned to illu&s;trate the honors of his name, being abundant proof of his &s;upreme authority, of the holine&s;s of his law, and the gracious purpo&s;es of his love: As the jewi&s;h polity was de&s;igned to ex|hibit lively repre&s;entations of the divine purpo&s;es to|wards his people; &s;o the mo&s;t material and leading di&s;pen&s;ations in their government were typical of events which have their fulle&s;t accompli&s;hment in the go&s;pel church. While the prophets, therefore, addre&s;&s;ed the I&s;raelites in the name of the Lord, whether in the way of admonition or con&s;olation, their language was abundantly &s;ignificant, and well adapted to throw &s;ome light on the grand plan of divine grace which re&s;pects not the jews only, but the gentiles al&s;o, even the true church of Chri&s;t in all ages.</P>
<P>Thus emblematical was the moral and political &s;tate of the Jews. Their being carried captive into Babylon and God's dealings with them there, their re&s;ettlement in their own land again, and the whole &s;eries of divine providence towards them, down to the incarnation of the Me&s;&s;iah were all full of in&s;truction; &s;o that while the prophets &s;pake on the&s;e topicks, they were often tran&s;ported into far di&s;tant times, and di&s;cribed the important characters and offices of Chri&s;t, and the &s;tate of the go&s;pel Church.</P>
<P>Accordingly while I&s;aiah, the great evangelical prophet of the jewi&s;h di&s;pen&s;ation, was &s;peaking of the &s;ignal deliverance of I&s;rael from the land of their captivity, and their re&s;ettling in the land of Judea, he is moved by the Holy Gho&s;t, to &s;peak of the great <HI>Me&s;&s;iah</HI>'s kingdom, and of that joy and
<PB N="8" REF="009403_0006_0F7403C599CFA698">
gladne&s;s which his go&s;pel &s;hall in&s;pire, when it &s;hall be &s;pread thro' the world, and the ends of the earth &s;ee <HI>his</HI> &s;alvation. This divine Saviour is the <HI>comforter</HI> and <HI>redeemer</HI> of his people. He has, in an emphatic &s;en&s;e, peculiar to him&s;elf, a&s;&s;umed this amiable character; and his works evince that he has a ju&s;t right to it. For this purpo&s;e he hath made bare his holy arm from age to age, while he has maintained the cau&s;e of his church, and made the ends of the earth &s;ee his &s;alvation.</P>
<P>Were we to trace the hi&s;tory of his church from <HI>Adam</HI> to the pre&s;ent time, we &s;hould find the vi&s;ible foot&s;teps of this divine Saviour, thro' the whole, and a mo&s;t happy coincidence with the promi&s;es and prophe&s;ies relating to him on &s;acred record.</P>
<P>Accordingly the pa&s;&s;age before us leads us to con&s;ider the words as they had reference,</P>
<P N="1">I. To the great &s;alvation wrought for the Jews when they were redeemed from their babyloni&s;h captivity, and put into the full enjoyment of their invaluable liberties under <HI>Jehovah</HI> their king.</P>
<P N="2">II. As particularly pointing out the great &s;al|vation wrought by Chri&s;t, and the joy of the go&s;pel church.</P>
<P>We &s;hall view them,</P>
<P N="3">III. As accommodated to the remarkable interpo&s;itions of God's holy providence in favour of the Prote&s;tant church, in it's ri&s;e and progre&s;s down to the pre&s;ent day. Particularly in the late war.</P>
<P>We are to con&s;ider the words,</P>
<P N="1">I. As they de&s;cribe the great &s;alvation wrought for the <HI>Jews</HI> when they were redeemed from the babyloni&s;h captivity, and put into the full enjoyment
<PB N="9" REF="009403_0007_0F7403C63822D1B0">
of their invaluable liberties under <HI>Jehovah</HI> their King.</P>
<P>The prophet I&s;aiah foretold the captivity of <HI>Judah</HI> for their idolatry and rebellion again&s;t God; he likewi&s;e predicted their re&s;toration, after they &s;hould be humbled in the land of their di&s;tre&s;s. As the threatning took place upon them, and their land was laid wa&s;te 70 years; &s;o the promi&s;e like|wi&s;e, received a punctual accompli&s;hment. For at the end of 70 years the decree went forth under the hand of the great <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> monarch, to relea&s;e the jewi&s;h captives and rebuild Jeru&s;alem. "Thus &s;aith <HI>Cyrus</HI> king of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> the Lord God of heaven hath given me all the kingdoms of the earth, and he hath charged me to build him an hou&s;e at <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> which is in <HI>Judah:</HI> Who is there among you, of all his people? his God be with him, and let him go up to Jeru&s;alem which is in <HI>Judah,</HI> and build the hou&s;e of the Lord God of I&s;rael (he is the God) which is in Jeru&s;alem: And who&s;oever remaineth in any place where he &s;ojourneth let the men of his place help him with &s;ilver and with gold and with goods." To this important event the words of my text primarily refered. <HI>Then</HI> Zion's wa&s;te places rejoyced, becau&s;e they were &s;urprizingly repleni&s;hed and greatly com|forted. Tho&s;e parts of Jeru&s;alem which had been for&s;aken and appeared mo&s;t de&s;olate, "broke forth into joy and &s;ang together." For God "turned again the captivity of Judah as the &s;treams in the &s;outh. They repented of their idolatry and God forgave them their tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions: he remem|bred them in the land where they were led captive and delivered them from their oppre&s;&s;ors. He
<PB N="10" REF="009403_0008_0F7403C9E7C98C00">
made tho&s;e who had led them captives, help them with their &s;ub&s;tance in their journey to Jeru&s;alem, in rebuilding the walls of the city, and the hou&s;e of the Lord. "They had &s;old them&s;elves by their tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, and the Lord redeemed them with|out money." He inriched them with the trea&s;ures of the <HI>Per&s;ian court,</HI> owned them his people&punc; and rebuked princes for their &s;ake. He planted them in Jeru&s;alem, and made them once more a flouri&s;hing &s;tate, a re&s;pectable nation. He comfort|ed them with his pre&s;ence and promi&s;es: He re-in&s;tated them in the free enjoyment of their religious as well as civil priviledges which were granted them as the &s;eed of Abraham, the children of the covenant, and in a peculiar &s;en&s;e &s;ubjects under Jehovah their king. The hi&s;tory of the&s;e things we have particularly related in the books of Ezra, Nehemiah and the le&s;&s;er prophets, who were &s;ent to incourage the Jews in rebuilding the temple, &amp;c. and to declare unto them the word of God unto the coming of Chri&s;t. And thus God was both the <HI>&s;aviour</HI> and <HI>comforter</HI> of his people.</P>
<P>In accompli&s;hing this great &s;alvation for the jewi&s;h church, the holy arm of the Lord was made <HI>bare</HI> in the eyes of all nations. For, beyond all di&s;pute it was his arm, his uncontroled influence over princes, and his univer&s;al providence in the government of the world which effected all for Judah, and wrought this great &s;alvation for his inheritance; could they a&s;cribe any thing to their own power or policy with regard to this re|markable event? Alas! they were broken and &s;catter'd thro' the whole Per&s;ian monarchy, and were a people hated of all nations. They were on
<PB N="11" REF="009403_0009_0F7403CA51C748E8">
the brink of total ruin, in the days of <HI>Aha&s;uerus.</HI> But God prevented the fatal blow. (This ac|count you have, at large in the book of E&s;ther.) As they were weak and contemptible in them|&s;elves, they were likewi&s;e without all hope from other nations. They had no powerful <HI>Ally</HI> to ri&s;e up, e&s;pou&s;e their cau&s;e, and compel their conquerors to re&s;ign their conque&s;ts and captives. Nay, &s;o very far from that, the nations around them laughed at their calamity, and &s;hook their head's in &s;corn, deriding the <HI>&s;eed of Abraham</HI> under the awful rebuke of the <HI>Mo&s;t High,</HI> &s;aying, <HI>ha, ha,</HI> &s;o would we have it. When the Princes of Judah were rebuilding Jeru&s;alem and the temple, the neighbouring nations united their power and policy to hinder the work, and prevent Judah from being any more a di&s;tinct body. But, behold the arm of the Lord is revealed, bla&s;ting all the de&s;igns of Sanballat and Tobiah, and carrying for|ward this great work by a &s;eries of remarkable providences, which abundantly demon&s;trated his &s;upreme government and peculiar care of his church: He turned the heart of Cyrus and Aha&s;u|erus as the rivers of water are turned, and made them nur&s;ing fathers unto his Jewi&s;h church; he removed ob&s;ticles in&s;uperable to all human power, and &s;pake to his people in this comfortable lan|guage. "Not by might nor by power; but by my &s;pirit &s;aith the Lord of ho&s;ts: Who art thou O great mountain? before Zerubbabel thou &s;halt become a plain, and he &s;hall bring forth the head &s;tone with &s;houting, crying, <HI>grace, grace</HI> unto it:" I&s;rael and all the nations around were taught thus to a&s;cribe the re&s;toration of Judah, the rebulding of
<PB N="12" REF="009403_0010_0F7403CBC12409B8">
Jeru&s;alem and the temple, to the power and grace of the mo&s;t high: Thus he redeemed Jeru&s;alem, comforted his people, revealed the arm of his power and grace in the eyes of all nations, and the ends of the earth then &s;aw his &s;alvation.</P>
<P>But all this was emblematical of a far more important event, in which divine power and grace have illumined the world, and &s;hone with the benign beams of &s;alvation unto the ends of the earth: We accordingly propo&s;ed to con&s;ider the words,</P>
<P N="2">II. As pointing to the great &s;alvation wrought by our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and the joy of the go&s;pel-church. That this is no forced con&s;truc|tion of the pa&s;&s;age before us, but agreeable to the de&s;ign of the Holy Gho&s;t, is evident from the man|ner in which the whole pa&s;&s;age is refered to, in the New-Te&s;tament: The introduction to the text in hand, is quoted by St. Paul and applied to go&s;pel times: And truly it is admirably adapted to expre&s;s the glad tidings of &s;alvation by Je&s;us Chri&s;t. "How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that publi&s;heth peace, that bringeth good tidings of good, that publi&s;heth &s;alvation, that &s;aith unto Zion thy God reigneth"! How joyful is the voice of him, that declareth this me&s;&s;age to a lo&s;t world, that the deliverer is come out of Zion,..... that he is come a "<HI>light</HI> unto the Gentiles and the glory of his people I&s;rael"&mdash; that he is come not to condemn the world; but that the world thro' him might be &s;aved?" In what loud acclamations of prai&s;e &s;hould a &s;inful world, expo&s;ed to unutterable and everla&s;ting puni&s;hment, welcome this divine Saviour, and the tidings of
<PB N="13" REF="009403_0011_0F7403CC47A8C120">
peace which his go&s;pel proclaims? Surely, they &s;hould brake forth into joy, they &s;hould &s;ing toge|ther in con&s;ort with the angelic choir, "Glory to God in the highe&s;t, peace on earth, good will to|wards men." To this mo&s;t joyful event the whole jewi&s;h oeconomy had a very material and principal reference. Indeed &s;o great is this go&s;pel &s;alvation, that the deliverance of the Jews from their captive &s;tate, was but an imperfect emblem of the deliver|ance accompli&s;hed by Je&s;us Chri&s;t for all that be|lieve. The me&s;&s;engers &s;ent expre&s;s by Cyrus to publi&s;h the gracious edict, and proclaim his royal favor, were not &s;o welcome to Jews in&s;laved in a &s;trange land, as the me&s;&s;engers of the go&s;pel, and the gracious de&s;igns of the <HI>Lord Jehovah</HI> to &s;uch as have any proper &s;en&s;e of their moral &s;tate.</P>
<P>For,</P>
<P>The ca&s;e of the I&s;raelites in Babylon did but imperfectly repre&s;ent the deplorable &s;tate of man|kind led captive by their own lu&s;ts and the prince of darkne&s;s: Jeru&s;alem all in ruins was a <HI>faint</HI> emblem of the ruin which &s;in had introduced into the world; and the bad &s;tate of the jewi&s;h polity, while the whole head was &s;ick, and the whole heart faint, was but a weak repre&s;entation of the moral &s;tate of the world. For, all had rebel|led again&s;t their rightful &s;overeign, broke covenant with God, and incurred the penalty of his holy law: all had &s;inned, and were cut off from all rea&s;onable hopes of ju&s;tification by the deeds of the law. All were concluded under &s;in, both the natural and judicial con&s;equence whereof were <HI>darkne&s;s, di&s;pair,</HI> and <HI>death</HI>: Thus all man|kind had de&s;troyed them&s;elves; but in Chri&s;t Je&s;us
<PB N="14" REF="009403_0012_0F7403CD0F469948">
was their help: When there was no eye to pity, no human or angelic arm that could &s;ave, the Lord pitied, and his omnipotent arm wrought &s;alva|tion: Our help was laid on one mighty to &s;ave, who was revealed fir&s;t, in promi&s;es and prophe&s;ies, in types and figures under the jewi&s;h ritual. But when the fulne&s;s of time was come, he appeared in our nature&mdash;fulfiled all righteou&s;ne&s;s&mdash;confirm|ed his divine mi&s;&s;ion by a &s;eries of miracles&mdash; taught the way of God in truth; and made his &s;oul an offering for &s;in: For "he was wounded for our tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, and brui&s;ed for iniquities, the chai&s;|ti&s;ment of our peace was upon him, and by his &s;tripes we are healed." "He once &s;uffered for &s;ins the ju&s;t for the unju&s;t that he might bring us unto God." And as he was delivered unto death for our offences, &s;o he ro&s;e again for our ju&s;tifica|tion; and a&s;cended into the highe&s;t heavens as our advocate and interce&s;&s;or. God has accepted this &s;atisfaction, and peace is preached in his name: All that believe "obtain redemption thro' his blood even the forgivene&s;s of their &s;ins, and an inheritance among them that are &s;anctified." Thus the glo|rious Lord Je&s;us hath redeemed his people. He hath paid the full price of their redemption&mdash; wrought out perfect righteou&s;ne&s;s, and prepared the way for their re&s;toration to the divine favour. He has likewi&s;e purcha&s;ed for them the renewing and &s;anctifying influence of the holy &s;pirit. He is the glorious head of divine influence, and of his fulne&s;s they receive, and grace for grace. In a word, "he is made of God unto them that believe, wi&s;dom, righteou&s;ne&s;s, &s;anctification and redemp|tion." Thus he has made bare his holy arm, and
<PB N="15" REF="009403_0013_0F7403CDC439A270">
&s;aves his true I&s;rael from their &s;ins, and from wrath to come.</P>
<P>He not only redeems, but <HI>comforts</HI> his people; and this is one of tho&s;e amiable characters under which he is repre&s;ented in the text. Nor is it among the lea&s;t of the glories of his go&s;pel that it is calculated to mini&s;ter the mo&s;t rational <HI>con&s;olation,</HI> where con&s;olation was mo&s;t wanted;&mdash;that it throws the full blaze of day on a &s;ubject which be|fore was either totally hid, or at be&s;t, &s;een only in the faint gleam of imperfect light: For "life and immortality are brought to light by the go&s;pel:" "and God in Chri&s;t is evidently reconciling the world unto him&s;elf, not imputing unto men their tre&s;pa&s;&s;es." So that with the &s;tricte&s;t propriety, our gracious Saviour may be &s;tiled the comforter of his people.</P>
<P>Accordingly the great <HI>Immanuel</HI> open'd his public commi&s;&s;ion, by applying to him&s;elf tho&s;e very memorable words in the 61&s;t of I&s;aiah: Jehovah anointed <HI>him</HI> to preach good tidings unto the meek,&mdash;he was &s;ent to bind up the broken hearted......to proclaim liberty to the captives.....and the opening of the pri&s;on to them that are bound&mdash; to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord&mdash;to comfort all that mourn ...... to give unto them the oyl of joy for mourning. What matter of infinite joy and con&s;olation is it to a &s;oul under a deep &s;en&s;e of &s;in, to hear that there is pardon purcha&s;ed for &s;ins of the deepe&s;t dye!.....that the everla&s;ting Father is well plea&s;ed with the mediatorial character of his Son our Saviour...... that he has accepted his righ|teou&s;ne&s;s and &s;ufferings; that Chri&s;t is the pro|pitiation for our &s;ins, and "the end of the law for
<PB N="16" REF="009403_0014_0F7403CE861C9728">
righteou&s;ne&s;s unto every one that believes!" O how welcome to a &s;elf-judging, &s;elf-condemned &s;inner, mu&s;t be the pure go&s;pel of Je&s;us, removing at once all di&s;tinctions among &s;inners in point of ju&s;tification, and a&s;&s;uring that the blood of Je&s;us clean&s;es from all iniquity,.......that God ju&s;tifies the ungodly merely on account of the perfect righteou&s;|ne&s;s of Chri&s;t imputed to all &s;uch as believe&mdash;that Je&s;us Chri&s;t is pa&s;&s;ed into the heavens, a great high prie&s;t, and is indeed "able to &s;ave unto the utter|mo&s;t all them that come unto God by him!" Truly the&s;e "are glad tidings of great joy," with which our gracious Lord is comforting his people.</P>
<P>But with the&s;e mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be connected, the promi&s;e of the holy &s;pirit to impre&s;s on the mind the <HI>truth</HI> and infinite <HI>importance</HI> of the&s;e doctrines,...... to renew and transform the &s;oul and to "unite us to Chri&s;t in our effectual calling." How comfortable, how joyful then, mu&s;t be the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t to &s;uch as are properly convinced of their impotence, as well as their guilt! To hear that he is the Lord our <HI>&s;trength,</HI> as well as our righteou&s;ne&s;s,.......that "he is exalted to God's right hand to give repentance and the remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins"&mdash; that who&s;oever cometh unto him is drawn of the Father, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>John</HI> VI, 44,&mdash;</NOTE> and &s;hall in no wi&s;e be ca&s;t out. <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">37.</NOTE>.......

<P>Thus the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t is indeed matter of great joy to a guilty helple&s;s world, as it points us to one, who&s;e perfect righteou&s;ne&s;s ju&s;tifies, who&s;e powerful &s;pirit &s;anctifies.....

<P>Moreover, he comforts his people with his gracious pre&s;ence and the con&s;olations of his holy &s;pirit.

<P>In fine, he comforts all true believers, with the &s;ure hopes of eternal glory.

<P>Among all the remarkable events &s;ince the commencement of the chri&s;tian <HI>Aera,</HI> &s;uch as have had re&s;pect to the prote&s;tant church are very con|&s;iderable. The great governor of the world, and &s;aviour of his church, has marvellou&s;ly di&s;played his holy arm in the eyes of all nations, in &s;preading prote&s;tant principles and carrying forward a great work of <HI>reformation,</HI> in &s;o many &s;tates and nations at once, with &s;uch &s;urpri&s;ing rapidity, contrary to all human probabilities; and then, in defending the prote&s;tant church, when it has been threatned from every quarter, with immediate and total de&s;truction.</P>
<P>To give a particular detail of all the remarkable di&s;plays of divine power and grace on this &s;ubject, would far exceed the limits of a &s;ermon, and &s;oon &s;well into volumes of church hi&s;tory. <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">As &s;ome of the following hi&s;torical hintsly &s;cattered in large tracts of political and church hi&s;tory, not lately in the author's power to peru&s;e, it is hoped the candid reader will excu&s;e their not being more accurately and circum&s;tantially related.</NOTE> I mu&s;t only hint a few, which ought never to be forgot, and &s;hould, on every remembrance of them, excite our gratitude to him, who has called his church from my&s;tical Babylon....delivered his cho&s;en, from the chains of <HI>Rome</HI> ..... inlightned and comforted his people with the uncorrupted word of life, and defended them, from age to age, with the protect|ing arm of his univer&s;al providence.</P>
<P>If we con&s;ider the &s;tate of the chri&s;tian world under the great papal apo&s;ta&s;y,....the general cor|ruption both in doctrine and manners, which &s;pread thro' all orders, and ranks of men,

in all nations and kingdoms which bore the name of chri&s;tian.....the dark aby&s;s of ignorance and &s;u|per&s;tition in which all were immerged.....the un|limited influence of the great roman <HI>pontiff,.</HI>...the pernicious blending of the civil and eccle&s;ia&s;tical <HI>polity,.</HI>..the immen&s;e trea&s;ures of the papal clergy... if we add to all the&s;e, the genius of their religion, adorned with all external pomp and magnificence, &s;uitable to &s;trike the &s;en&s;es with peculiar energy, and flatter all the fal&s;e hopes of a corrupt heart, &s;urely we &s;hall ob&s;erve no human probability could pre&s;age a reformation: But "all things are po&s;&s;ible with God." He poured out his &s;pirit on tho&s;e whom he had ordained in&s;truments in his hand of effecting a glorious <HI>reformation:</HI> He rai&s;ed up, qualified and &s;pirited <HI>Luther, Calvin</HI> and others, to ca&s;t off the papal yoke under which all Europe was at that time, &s;ubjugated,....to declare the pure go&s;pel of Je&s;us, and to a&s;&s;ert the liberty which be|lievers enjoy in Chri&s;t their only Lord.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t reformers were, both defended from the rage of their enemies, and &s;ucceeded in a manner truly wonderful. So that the period from 1560, to 1650, is filled with accounts little &s;hort of miraculous, in which a worthy author ob&s;erves, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. Dodderidge on Rev.</NOTE> it is more than probable that the "fifth angel poured out his viol on the &s;eat of the bea&s;t, and his Kingdom was full of darkne&s;s, and they gnawed their tongues for angui&s;h." During this period &s;everal nations renounced &s;ubjection to the Pope, and have continued free unto this day; and in other nations his power has been greatly abridged and re&s;trained. This appears more remarkable by con&s;idering, how numerous and formidable were the enemies of prote&s;tants in the infancy of the reformation.</P>

<P>The Pope claimed authority over all chri&s;tian princes&punc; and this authority had long been ceeded to him by univer&s;al con&s;ent. By this means, he had the mo&s;t powerful nations under his dictatorial influence, and wholly at his command. Nor did he fail to make u&s;e of this u&s;urped authority over all catholic princes, to extirpate <HI>this new here&s;y,</HI> (as he was plea&s;ed to term the <HI>pure religion</HI> of the go&s;pel.) When the briti&s;h monarchs dared to a&s;&s;ert the independant rights of their crown, and throw off their &s;ubjection to his pretended holine&s;s, that great deceiver arrogated to him&s;elf the right of de|throning princes, and of relea&s;ing &s;ubjects from all allegiance to their rightful &s;overeigns. Accordingly after thundering out his <HI>anathema</HI>'s again&s;t tho&s;e powers who refu&s;ed obedience to his bulls, he ex|horted and commanded tho&s;e deluded princes, whom he &s;till retained under his influence, to unite all their endeavors to carry his anathemas into effect. (But, the cur&s;e cau&s;ele&s;s &s;hall not come,) "he that &s;ets in the heavens laughed, the Lord had them in deri&s;ion." He made bare his holy arm in the eyes of all the&s;e nations; he appointed his &s;alvation around his church, and <HI>prote&s;tants</HI> were daily in|crea&s;ing. Again,</P>
<P>Do we con&s;ider the many <HI>per&s;ecutions</HI> which have been carried on, with infernal rage by catholic princes in <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> in <HI>Portugal</HI> and <HI>Germany,</HI> &s;urely, in a view of the &s;word, the gibbet, the halter, the &s;take, and all the dreadful <HI>apparatus</HI> of tortures and deaths in a thou&s;and other forms, the highe&s;t probability &s;ugge&s;ts that the&s;e will put a final &s;top to the progre&s;s of the reformation, and the very name of prote&s;tants cea&s;e from the earth.

<P>But in this review we cannot fail to ob&s;erve the di&s;pen&s;ations of divine providence towards this country. "We have heard with our ears, O God, our fathers have told us what works thou did&s;t, in their days, in the times of old, how thou did&s;t drive out the heathen with thy hand, and plante&s;t them, how thou did&s;t afflict the people and ca&s;t them out. For they got not the land in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion by their own &s;word, neither did their own arm &s;ave them; but thy right hand and thine arm, and the light of thy countenance, becau&s;e thou had&s;t a favour unto them." When a cloud was gathering over England and began to di&s;charge it&s;elf upon our father's, <HI>hither</HI> the divine hand of providence led them...<HI>here</HI> they &s;ought an <HI>a&s;ilum,</HI> and took their abode among &s;avage bea&s;ts and more &s;avage men.</P>
<P>They left their dear native country, their plea&s;|ant habitations, and indured a train of hard&s;hips, &s;carce credible to their po&s;terity, that they might wor&s;hip God according to their con&s;ciences, and maintain the prote&s;tant religion free from tho&s;e corruptions which the high-church party had introduced at home.</P>
<P>When we reflect on their de&s;ign, it appears truly noble, becoming the di&s;ciples of Chri&s;t, who has taught his followers, "to call no man <HI>ma&s;ter</HI> on earth," nor to receive for "doctrines the traditi|ons of men;" but when we con&s;ider the difficulties which were oppo&s;ed to this de&s;ign, meer rea&s;on &s;urely repre&s;ents it altogether impracticable.

<P><HI>Then</HI> the pure go&s;pel of <HI>Je&s;us</HI> the &s;aviour vi&s;ited this <HI>new world</HI> and the glorious &s;un of righteou&s;|ne&s;s aro&s;e on the&s;e benighted ends of the earth: <HI>then</HI> the wa&s;te places of <HI>America</HI> broke forth into joy, "the wilderne&s;s began to blo&s;om as a ro&s;e" and "the trees of the fore&s;t &s;ang together."</P>
<P>But the&s;e tranquil &s;cenes &s;oon clo&s;ed, and nu|merous tribes combined together, (many of them in open violation of their plighted faith) to make an utter end of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> in <HI>America.</HI> So few and defencele&s;s were our &s;ettlements at that time; and &s;o remote from their mother-country, that human probability devoted them an ea&s;y prey to their adver&s;aries: and &s;urely our fathers "had faint|ed had they not believed to &s;ee the &s;alvation of the Lord," But the <HI>pui&s;iant Jehovah</HI> was on their &s;ide. <Q>He taught their hands to war, and their fingers to fight;</Q> &s;o that in them the promi&s;e made to I&s;rael, was almo&s;t literally verified, viz. that "five &s;hall cha&s;e an hundred, and an hundred put ten thou&s;|and to flight."

<P>The righteous &s;overeign, in who&s;e hand the wicked are often the rod of his anger," has indeed &s;uffered the &s;avages to &s;hed much Engli&s;h blood, and &s;orely &s;courge the Briti&s;h colonies, even as the <HI>Canaanites</HI> afflicted I&s;rael of old; yet HE has greatly re&s;trained their rage, demini&s;hed their numbers, and enlarged the borders of his church. nor can we reflect without a&s;toni&s;hment on the happy change this land has undergone in the cour&s;e of one centry: the aboriginals have been mo&s;t remarkably declining: they have melted a|way, as &s;now before the &s;outhern breaze and &s;corching &s;un; while the churches of Chri&s;t have been greatly increa&s;ing, and are now become nu|merous in the&s;e teritories of the <HI>Prince</HI> of dark|ne&s;s.

<P>But while the Indian tribes were dimini&s;hing, a more dangerous enemy has been increa&s;ing, and incroaching upon us. <HI>Canada</HI> has been the <HI>Car|thage</HI> of New England; and the <HI>French</HI> have long endeavoured both by artifice and arms to drive us from this good land which the <HI>Lord God</HI> gave un|to our fathers.</P>

<P>We &s;hall now conclude with a few <HI>Inferences</HI> and &s;erious reflections &s;ugge&s;ted by our &s;ubject.</P>
<P N="1">1. What comfortable evidence may be deduced from the di&s;pen&s;ations of divine providence, in favour
<PB N="36" REF="009403_0034_0F7403E73818CB48">
of the truth, and importance of the prote&s;tant re|ligion!</P>
<P>This is far from being the only proof that pro|te&s;tani&s;m is the true religion of the go&s;pel, and the cau&s;e of God. It's purity, its &s;pirituality, its &s;implicity, its divine force on the hearts of thou&s;ands, their dying te&s;timony in favour of it, and above all, its being agreeable to the uncorrupted word of God, are the main <HI>ba&s;is</HI> on which it is &s;upported, and by which it mu&s;t carry conviction to all impar|tial judges. But methinks, when we reflect on the wonderful providences of God, in &s;upport of the prote&s;tant faith; and ob&s;erve, that God hath all along interpo&s;ed to prevent the total extirpation of it, even when earth and hell have been combin'd again&s;t it; when we con&s;ider how papal powers have been weakened; and the prote&s;tant nations from time to time, pre&s;erved and increa&s;ing in their numbers, and re&s;pectibility; and e&s;pecially, when we review the hand of God in the late war; &s;uch reflections mu&s;t afford a devout mind &s;ome &s;ingular &s;atisfaction. Verily, God hath been in the mid&s;t of prote&s;tants, "a very pre&s;ent help": he has con|fe&s;&s;ed the cau&s;e his own, and been as a "wall of fire around us, the glory in the mid&s;t of us, and on all our glory he hath created a defence."</P>
<P N="2">2. What infinite gratitude &s;hould in&s;pire our hearts? all honour and glory be to <HI>Him,</HI> who hath not left us without a witne&s;s of his infinite mercy and loving-kindne&s;s toward our nation and land. "Not unto us, not unto us, but to the Lord <HI>mo&s;t High</HI> be all prai&s;e and glory:" God is the &s;overeign judge: he putteth down one and &s;itteth up another: "he pour|eth contempt on princes, and gives the kingdoms of the earth to whom he plea&s;es."</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="009403_0035_0F7403E79D3A3938">Allowing all due honour to our <HI>Briti&s;h Sove|reign,</HI> and mini&s;try, to our officers and &s;oldiery, (and much honour is &s;urely their due, yet) laying all circum&s;tances together, it was never more evi|dent than in the late war, that, "the race is not always to the &s;wift, nor the battle to the &s;trong, but victory is from the Lord." Let our hearts bound, then, to <HI>Him,</HI> who has made us to tri|umph with a very great di&s;parity of numbers, and brought our enemies to &s;ubmit them&s;elves. Let our hearts bound in gratitude to him, who direct|ed the councils of our nation, and afforded his di|vine influence in forming and &s;ucceeding the plan of the pre&s;ent peace; which, con&s;idering the high <HI>precedency</HI> of the Briti&s;h Sovereign above other princes; his regard to the intere&s;t of his &s;ubjects; his tender concern for the common good of man|kind; and the truly benevolent and generous prin|ciples on which he proceeds, renders him as <HI>re|&s;pectable</HI> in PEACE as he is <HI>revered</HI> in war.</P>

What &s;hame and blu&s;hing mu&s;t cover our faces before the holy one of I&s;rael, while we reflect on the number and ag|gravations of our iniquities? not for our righteou&s;ne&s;s has the Lord wrought this great &s;alvation for us, for we are a people laden with iniquity, but for his

<P N="4">4. How greatly does it concern us as a people to make a right improvement of the&s;e mercies?</P>
<P>All our advantages are tallents intru&s;ted us by the &s;upreme ruler of all. It behoves us to be faithful in our &s;teward&s;hip, to improve public mer|cies to the honour of Jehovah, and the advance|ment of the Redeemer's kingdom; lea&s;t our pro&s;|perity &s;hould prove to be the "pro&s;perity of fools which de&s;troys them."

<P N="5">5. Of what va&s;t importance is it to each one of us: to obtain a part in that great go&s;pel-&s;alvation, which extends its influence beyond the limits of the pre|&s;ent life; and to be intere&s;ted in his favour who go|verns all human affairs with a &s;pecial reference to the highe&s;t intere&s;t of his cho&s;en?</P>
<P>However important the fate of kingdoms may be in the pre&s;ent &s;tate, as they are made up of in|dividuals, and have a greater or le&s;s influence on the general &s;tate of the church; yet, in the mo&s;t intere&s;ting ca&s;e, we are to con&s;ider our&s;elves de|tached from all political bodies, and remember,

Nothing will &s;tand us in any &s;tead, when we are called off the &s;tage, but faith in Chri&s;t and obedience to his go&s;pel. We mu&s;t all appear before his judgment &s;eat, and render an account, every man &s;ingly for him&s;elf, of the talents intru&s;ted him, and the go&s;pel priviledges he has enjoyed. <HI>Then</HI> there will be no reference had to our being of this, or the other nation, our living in <HI>this</HI> or <HI>that</HI> age, any farther than we have thereby, had greater or le&s;s advantages to &s;erve the Lord. Oh! important, &s;olemn Day! when we mu&s;t lay a&s;ide all our pre&s;ent worldly connections; when it will no more avail us to plead, that we have been vi&s;ible members in the prote&s;tant church, or lived under the happy reign of GEORGE the third; than for Jews to plead, that Abraham was their father, and Mo&s;es their lawgiver. All mu&s;t then be determined by this &s;ingle Qe&s;tion, "<HI>art thou a &s;incere di&s;ciple of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and in|tere&s;ted in the great &s;alvation which he has wrought for his people?</HI> O my brethren; let nothing hide this &s;olemn day from our view; let nothing divert our chief attention from this, of all others the highe&s;t concern of mortals: let us lay hold on the go&s;pel-hope &s;et before us,&mdash;build our hopes for eternity on our intere&s;t in the adorable &s;aviour,&mdash;live up to the dignity of our calling and the &s;ublimity of our hopes,&mdash;and &s;o "lay up in &s;tore a good foundation again&s;t the time to come, that we may lay hold on eternal life."</P>
<P>To conclude,</P>
<P>How ardently &s;hould we pray for the inlargement of the re|deemer's kingdom? how much &s;hould we de&s;ire and endeavor the &s;preading of his glorious go&s;pel thro' the world, and par|ticularly among the <HI>Aboriginals</HI> of this land; that the&s;e ends of the earth may, in a yet more perfect manner, &s;ee the &s;alvation of our God? in how di&s;tingui&s;hing a manner are we favored by the great Lord of nature and of grace? Surely it &s;hould be our hearts de&s;ire and prayer to God that the ignorant nations may be acquainted with the glorious light of the go&s;pel which has long been &s;hining around us with &s;uch divine brightene&s;s. We are waiting, and we &s;hould be praying, in the mo&s;t fervent manner, for the Day of the church's greater inlargement, and divine glory&mdash;when nations &s;hall beat their &s;words into plow-&s;hares, and their &s;pears into pruning hooks&mdash;when men &s;hall learn war no more&mdash;when the wolf and the lamb &s;hall lie down together, &mdash;And PEACE and univer&s;al righteou&s;ne&s;s &s;hall reign trium|phant through all the Earth.
