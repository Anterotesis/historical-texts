<P>SHOULD this Di&s;cour&s;e ever be read beyond the bounds of the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts,</HI> it perhaps would be ne|ce&s;&s;ary to inform the reader, that the MIDDLESEX <HI>Medical A&s;&s;ociation</HI> is &s;o called from it's being compo&s;ed of practitioners living in the County of <HI>Middle&s;ex</HI> only.</P>
<P>This county deviates a little from a &s;quare, but it's area is nearly equal to a &s;quare of forty miles on a &s;ide. It is divided into <HI>forty one towns,</HI> and from a late enume|ration is found to contain rather more than <HI>forty two thou&s;and inhabitants.</HI></P>
<P>The principal towns are <HI>Cambridge, Concord, Charles|town, Medford</HI> and <HI>Watertown.</HI> CAMBRIDGE is di|&s;tingui&s;hed by the UNIVERSITY. A Society, that has for more than a century furni&s;hed &s;upplies of State&s;men, qualified to &s;upport the rights of mankind, and men eminent in every branch of literature.</P>
<P>CONCORD, a town plea&s;ant and flouri&s;hing, is &s;itu|ated nearly in the center of the county. CHARLES|TOWN is connected with BOSTON by a bridge <HI>fifteen hundred feet</HI> long. Cambridge, Concord, and Charles|town, were rendered famous by the military events of 1775 and 1776.</P>
<P>Middle&s;ex is watered by five rivers; the <HI>Merimac,</HI> the <HI>Charles,</HI> the <HI>Concord,</HI> the <HI>Na&s;hua,</HI> and the <HI>Mi&s;tic.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;outhern and northern &s;ides of the country are hilly; but cannot be con&s;idered as mountainous, few of the hills exceeding an hundred feet in height, being generally wooded or cultivated quite to the &s;ummit.</P>
<P>The climate is very fine, the air generally &s;erene, and the temperature mild. The extreme variation of Fahrenheit's thermometer may be con&s;idered as an <HI>hundred</HI> degrees in an year; but it is in very few in|&s;tances that in the cour&s;e of the year it reaches either

extreme. <HI>Ninety two</HI> degrees may be con&s;idered as the extreme of &s;ummer heat; and <HI>five</HI> or <HI>&s;ix</HI> degrees below 0 as that of the winter cold. In&s;tances are to be found of it's exceeding the&s;e limits, but they are &s;o rare, as to be exceptions to the general rule.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>At <HI>Newton,</HI> which joins to <HI>Cambridge,</HI> the bills of mortality have been kept for a &s;eries of years with great exactne&s;s. By them it appears that the annual number of tho&s;e who have died within ten years, pa&s;t, is one out of <HI>&s;eventy,</HI> and for the nine years preceeding one out of <HI>eighty.</HI> In <HI>London</HI> and <HI>Paris</HI> it is computed that one out of <HI>twenty</HI> die annually.

<HEAD>An Ab&s;tract from the Con&s;titution of the MIDDLESEX MEDICAL ASSOCIATION.</HEAD>
<P>I. AS health is a ble&s;&s;ing which &s;weetens all enjoyments, and long life that which all men naturally de&s;ire, &s;o he who labours to teach his fellow creatures how to &s;ecure the one, and to attain the other, may ju&s;tly be numbered among the benefactors of mankind.</P>
<P>II. SEEING, the mind and body have &s;uch a mutual influence on each other, that, examined apart, they can never be thoroughly under&s;tood, it is incumbent on every one who taketh upon him&s;elf the title of Phy&s;ician, to examine and &s;tudy the con&s;titution and influence of both, in order that he may pre&s;erve to his fellow crea|tures that greate&s;t of ble&s;&s;ing, <Q><HI>a &s;ound mind in a &s;ound body.</HI></Q></P>
<P>III. IT is the duty of the Phy&s;ician, by a &s;kil|ful direction of the powers of human nature, to pre&s;erve as long as po&s;&s;ible, the life, the health, and faculties committed to his care. The charge is important, the field exten&s;ive, and the calling honourable.</P>
<P>IV. To qualify him&s;elf for &s;uch noble purpo|&s;es, it is his duty to examine the animal economy, to attend to the outward operations of nature, and to the qualities and operations of medicines,
<PB N="vii" REF="024987_0006_100A864FE5A33548">
in order to inve&s;tigate the cau&s;es of di&s;ea&s;es, and to learn their cure.</P>
<P>V. As of all natural bodies, none are found &s;o variou&s;ly compounded as the human; &s;o the in|quiry into its nature, is to be placed among the mo&s;t &s;ubtle and difficult of &s;tudies. The mo&s;t improved and readie&s;t mea&s;ures ought therefore to be pur&s;ued to facilitate an inquiry &s;o difficult.</P>
<P>VI. THE Medical Art is the offspring of expe|rience: yet life is too &s;hort, occa&s;ion too &s;udden, experiment too dangerous, and judgment too in|&s;ufficient for any one per&s;on to acquire a compe|tent knowledge of di&s;ea&s;es, and their remedies, by his own experience.</P>
<P>VII. As Phy&s;ick therefore mu&s;t grow up from a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of di&s;coveries and experiments hand|ed down from generation to generation, it is evi|dent, that any individual, however warmly di&s;|po&s;ed to promote the utility of his profe&s;&s;ion, can do but little, unle&s;s he has the united ob&s;ervati|ons of others to a&s;&s;i&s;t him. Hence the expediency of Societies and A&s;&s;ociations.</P>
<P>VIII. OF the various methods of attaining and diffu&s;ing Medical knowledge, none is found &s;o effectual or de&s;irable, as a friendly intercour&s;e and a&s;&s;ociation of its profe&s;&s;ors, e&s;pecially when their principal aim is mutual improvement.</P>
<P><PB N="viii" REF="024987_0007_100A8653DB48AE20">
IX. MOREOVER, by thus a&s;&s;ociating, &s;uch liberal and generous &s;entiments will probably be culti|vated, as tend to eradicate prejudices and unwor|thy practices, which at times have not only di&s;|graced the profe&s;&s;ion, but injured mankind.</P>
<P>X. CONVINCED of the&s;e things, and of the nece&s;&s;ity of making ob&s;ervations our&s;elves, in&s;tead of relying on tho&s;e made in a di&s;tant quarter of the globe, WE, who&s;e names are hereunto &s;ub|&s;cribed, do form our&s;elves into a Society, by the name of the MIDDLESEX MEDICAL ASSO|CIATION, and do agree to the regulations following:</P>

He &s;hall vin|dicate and &s;upport the character of each a&s;&s;ociate, as far as ju&s;tice and propriety will admit, ever e&s;teeming it di&s;honourable to advance his own reputation on the ruin of another.</P>

<P>Whereas manifold inconveniences have ari&s;en, from the want of a regular and uniform method of educating pupils in phy&s;ick, e&s;pecially in the country, whereby candidates for practice, when offered to the regularly appointed examiners, have been embarra&s;&s;ed and ob&s;tructed, though otherwi&s;e not ill informed: It is therefore the de&s;ire of this A&s;&s;ociation to remedy as &s;peedily and prudently as po&s;&s;ible, an inconvenience &s;o loudly complained of.</P>

<DIV2 N="15" TYPE="regulation">
<HEAD>XV.</HEAD>
<P>As this matter may not have been &s;ufficiently con&s;idered, it will not perhaps be u&s;ele&s;s to re|mark, that for want of regularity and method, the young mind often perplexes it&s;elf, and makes not an advantageous u&s;e of the real helps within its reach. Much the greate&s;t difficulty the &s;tu|dent has to encounter, is to know how to avoid tho&s;e who are only the compilers and tran&s;cribers of tho&s;e who went before them, and apply him|&s;elf to the few original authors. The &s;y&s;tems of phy&s;ick are mo&s;tly compilations, and differ from one another, rather in neatne&s;s, order, and ele|gance, than in any thing material. Hence the expediency of u&s;ing a &s;et of approved authors in the various branches of medicine. It is there|fore earne&s;tly recommended to each and every

member of this A&s;&s;ociation, to direct his pupils to as regular and uniform cour&s;e of &s;tudy as may be, and to imitate, as nearly as po&s;&s;ible, the order now e&s;tabli&s;hed in the mo&s;t eminent medical &s;chools.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="16" TYPE="regulation">
<HEAD>XVI.</HEAD>
<P>In order that the education of pupils &s;hould be more uniform and reputable, it is the &s;en&s;e of this A&s;&s;ociation, that before a per&s;on be qualified to enter upon the &s;tudy of phy&s;ick, it is nece&s;&s;ary that he have not only an accurate knowledge of his native tongue, but &s;o much of the Latin and Greek, as to tran&s;late them by the help of a dictionary.</P>

<DIV2 N="17" TYPE="regulation">

<P>Before any pupil offer him&s;elf to the <HI>Cen&s;ors of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts Medical Society,</HI> for examina|tion, the Phy&s;ician who recommends him &s;hall be certain that he has &s;uch a knowledge of <HI>Anatomy</HI> as is nece&s;&s;ary to under&s;tand the animal economy, both in its &s;ound and morbid &s;tate; likewi&s;e an acquaintance with di&s;ea&s;es, and the u&s;ual method of treating them; al&s;o a knowledge of the prin|ciples of <HI>Chemi&s;try, Materia Medica,</HI> and the ope|ration of remedies&mdash;an acquaintance with at lea&s;t the elementary parts of <HI>Mathematicks,</HI> of <HI>Natural Hi&s;tory,</HI> and <HI>Natural Philo&s;ophy,</HI> although not ab|&s;olutely enjoined, are deemed very de&s;irable.</P>

<HEAD>ON THE RISE, PROGRESS, AND PRESENT STATE OF MEDICINE, A DISCOURSE.</HEAD>
<P>IN complying with the reque&s;t of this a&s;&s;ocia|tion, I perceive nothing more difficult, than to be&s;tow on what is common the grace of novelty, and to render &s;o dry a &s;ubject as phy&s;ick in any degree entertaining to a mixed audience. Our theme leading to the frigid and formal &s;tyle of a lecture, rather than the animated &s;trains of an oration.</P>
<P>THE hi&s;tory of the medical art is &s;o well known to the members of this &s;ociety, that my ta&s;k will be rather to remind than inform them: Yet what &s;ubject can be more &s;uitable for our fir&s;t di&s;cour&s;e, than the hi&s;tory of <HI>the ri&s;e and progre&s;s of the</HI> HFALING ART: That art who&s;e improve|ment and diffu&s;ion is the end and aim of our a&s;&s;ociation?</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="024987_0013_100A86607A11D458">
THE origin of mo&s;t arts is involved in fable, and wrapt in great ob&s;curity; that of medicine &s;eems covered with almo&s;t an impenetrable veil. Until the greater purpo&s;es of &s;ociety were an&s;wered, the nece&s;&s;ities of mankind &s;upplied, architecture and other nece&s;&s;ary arts introduced, men of genius had neither lei&s;ure nor inclination to record their theories of the origin of mankind, and the ri&s;e of the arts. The remedies fir&s;t &s;ought for, in the earlier ages, were probably &s;ome mild, tenacious, pla&s;tic &s;ub&s;tances, &s;uitable to defend a wound from air, and &s;ecure it from external injuries. Accident and random experiment may have en|crea&s;ed the number of &s;uch &s;imple remedies, which may have been trea&s;ured up by a particular family, or &s;ome individual of a tribe. But at the&s;e early periods of &s;ociety, when letters were unknown, what was once out of &s;ight was lo&s;t forever.</P>
<P>IF we &s;earch the olde&s;t book we have for infor|mation on this &s;ubject, we &s;earch in vain. This will not appear &s;o extraordinary to tho&s;e, who re|flect that the &s;acred hi&s;tory is confined to but a part of <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> and a &s;mall portion of the north ea&s;t part of <HI>Africa;</HI> and that it is &s;o conci&s;e in regard to time, that the hi&s;tory of twenty centuries is compri&s;ed in eleven &s;hort chapters.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Gene&s;is.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="024987_0014_100A8663C7544C08">
WE find the author of the&s;e annals, the hebrew legi&s;lator and general, giving directions for the health of his people; but no mention is made of Phy&s;icians, as a di&s;tinct profe&s;&s;ion, until the em|balming of <HI>Jacob.</HI> Prior to the&s;e writings, is the aera of ab&s;olute darkne&s;s; and we have no account by which we can judge of ancient tradition, un|le&s;s we admit that of the <HI>Chine&s;e,</HI> who&s;e great an|tiquity, corroborated by a&s;tronomical ob&s;erva|tions, carries the hi&s;tory of the human race a va&s;t way further back. Yet their &s;light acquaintance with anatomy, and their ignorance of chemi&s;try, render their great knowledge in phy&s;ic as doubt|ful as their chronology.</P>
<P>AS we receive &s;o little light from the&s;e ancient pro&s;e writers, let us turn towards tho&s;e earlier luminaries the Poets.</P>
<P>POETRY has every where preceded pro&s;e, and the powers of the imagination always have been indulged, before the operations of the judgment were exerci&s;ed. Tho&s;e early effu&s;ions of genius were epic poetry, or exaggerated hi&s;tory, record|ing battles, heroes and gho&s;ts; dwelling on the marvellous, and often the incredible. In the&s;e fabulous ages it was the cu&s;tom to dre&s;s in&s;truction in the garb of allegory. Thus the <HI>Egyptian, Gre|cian</HI> and <HI>Roman</HI> poets attributed the origin of the Healing Art to the Sun, who was called <HI>Orus</HI> by
<PB N="4" REF="024987_0015_100A86662C46A3F8">
the Egyptians, <HI>Phoebus</HI> and <HI>Apollo</HI> by the Greeks and Romans. Conceiving the &s;un to be the pa|rent of life and cheerfulne&s;s, who&s;e genial warmth and vivifying energy animated and &s;u&s;tained all nature; they adored it as the re&s;plendent &s;ource of light, life, health and joy. They &s;aw nothing on earth which bore &s;o &s;triking a re&s;emblance to this heavenly luminary, as he, who relieved pain, di&s;&s;ipated melancholy, di&s;pelled di&s;ea&s;es, and pro|longed life. Thence they concluded that the fir&s;t phy&s;ician was an offspring or emanation of the <HI>"Prime cheerer light."</HI> Accordingly we find the cla&s;&s;ical poets repre&s;enting <HI>Apollo,</HI> as the primary GOD of phy&s;ic; and his &s;on Ae&s;culapius whom they al&s;o deified, as its fir&s;t profe&s;&s;or. They like|ned the human body to a delicate mu&s;ical in&s;tru|ment, ea&s;ily di&s;ordered, and therefore united mu&s;ic and medicine in Apollo. They conceived that the office of the phy&s;ician, was to tune this com|plicated organ the body, to make every part act in concert, and reduce the whole to harmony.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Bacon de augment. Scientiar.</NOTE></P>
<P>THE per&s;on of <HI>Ae&s;culapius</HI> is &s;o envelloped in fable, that we &s;carcely know when, or where he lived. He is confounded by &s;ome with <HI>Melam|pus,</HI> who lived about 100 years after <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> and who having travelled into Egypt, brought from thence into Greece, not only the art of phy&s;ic, but much of their theology and &s;uper&s;tition, together with their magic or divination.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="024987_0016_100A8667B6140A38">

<P>SUCH was the &s;tate of medicine when <HI>Boerhaave</HI> began to teach. The figure this great man made in the medical world, will ju&s;tify our dwelling a little on his character and works. It is perhaps unnece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay, that he was a profe&s;&s;or in the Univer&s;ity of <HI>Leyden,</HI> and that he died about 50 years ago. <HI>Boerhaave</HI> was &s;on of the pari&s;h mini|&s;ter of a village near <HI>Leyden,</HI> and he him&s;elf was educated for that profe&s;&s;ion. From the infor|mation of his biographers and his own writings, we learn, that from the peru&s;al of early writers in divinity, he was &s;truck with the profounde&s;t vene|ration for the &s;implicity and purity of their doc|trines, and the &s;anctity of their di&s;cipline; but as he de&s;cended to the lower ages, he found the peace of chri&s;tianity broken by u&s;ele&s;s controver&s;ies, and its doctrines &s;ophi&s;ticated by the &s;ubtleties of the &s;chools. He found the holy writers interpreted according to the reigning philo&s;ophers, and chi|meras of metaphy&s;icians adopted as articles of faith. He then quitted the pur&s;uit of divinity,
<PB N="14" REF="024987_0025_100A867D472B3868">
and applied to the &s;tudy of phy&s;ic, when he was more than xxx years of age. But he found it nearly the &s;ame in phy&s;ic as he experienced in divinity. He perceived that the moderns had widely deviated from the &s;implicity and purity of the antients; chimeras and idle notions adopted as articles of belief, or rules of practice, and the writings of the founder of our profe&s;&s;ion &s;trangely corrupted and mi&s;applied.</P>
<P>WHEN <HI>Boerhaave</HI> began to practi&s;e phy&s;ic, he received but little encouragement. His bu&s;ine&s;s was at fir&s;t very &s;mall, and his circum&s;tances by no means ea&s;y. But &s;uperior to every di&s;courage|ment, he continued his &s;earch after truth and knowledge; determined that pro&s;perity, were he ever to enjoy it, &s;hould be the con&s;equence, not of mean artifice, cringing &s;olicitation, or degrading complacency, but of real merit and &s;olid learning. Nor was he di&s;appointed. After giving lectures at <HI>Leyden</HI> for a &s;eries of years with great applau&s;e, his reputation bore &s;ome proportion to his merit, and extended it&s;elf to di&s;tant countries; in&s;omuch, that &s;carcely a learned &s;ociety in Europe, but was eager to elect him a member, &s;carcely a crowned head, but &s;ought &s;ome means to honor him.

Perhaps it com|pri&s;es more medical knowledge, than any book extant of its &s;ize.</P>
<P>THE mo&s;t &s;triking feature in the Boerhaavian theory, is the explanation of all the phaenomena of the animal oeconomy on mechanical principles. It a&s;&s;erts, that the human body is truly a me|chanical &s;tructure, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es all the properties belonging to a &s;ubject be&s;t qualified for mecha|nical &s;peculation; therefore a mechanical frame and that the human machine, is by the &s;ame laws explicable by geometry; and there is nothing, he thinks, in all its &s;olids or fluids but what is ex|plicable upon mathematical principles.</P>

He therefore publi&s;hed it as his opinion "that the greater part of di&s;ea&s;es, if not all of them, were affections of the <HI>nervous &s;y&s;tem."</HI> This hypothe&s;is, amplified and further illu&s;trated, is the celebrated <HI>Cullenian Sy&s;tem.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Encyclop.

<P>THE &s;tate of &s;cience is very different now from what it was 200 years &s;ince. The philo&s;ophy of <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI> mi&s;under&s;tood, the fal&s;e theories of <HI>Galen,</HI> and the jargon of the <HI>Chemi&s;ts,</HI> formed &s;o thick a cloud, that truth and nature could &s;carcely be &s;een through it. When this was di&s;pelled by <HI>Lord Bacon</HI> and others, the aera of experiment followed. Philo&s;ophers and phy&s;icians labored to <HI>accumulate facts.</HI> Societies were every where e&s;tabli&s;hed for this expre&s;s purpo&s;e. A diffu&s;ive manner of writing crept in, and grew up among authors. It was the fa&s;hion to print not only all that a man thought, but to quote all that he found any body el&s;e thought: and he was &s;carcely e&s;teemed a lite|rary man, who publi&s;hed any thing le&s;s than a folio. But now it is wholly different. In&s;tead of that diffu&s;ive manner of writing, authors feel the nece&s;&s;ity of con&s;olidating and concentrating &s;cience. They find that the &s;ub&s;tance of folios may be dige&s;ted into a few pages, and the e&s;&s;ence of libraries compre&s;&s;ed within a few volumes.
