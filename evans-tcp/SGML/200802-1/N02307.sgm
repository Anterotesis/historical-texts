</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_IN this Chapter we have holy <HI>Job</HI> religiou&s;ly meditating on the <HI>Life</HI> &amp; <HI>Death</HI> of Man; com|muning with his own Heart, and expo&s;tulating with GOD.</P>
<P>IN the fir&s;t <HI>6</HI> ver&s;es, he re|pre&s;ents the &s;hortne&s;s and un|certainty of our Lives, the va|nity &amp; vexation of the World, the Pollution of hu|man Nature, and the &s;ettled Period of human Life: and urges the&s;e Con&s;iderations with GOD, as &s;o many Pleas for Mercy and Forbearance. <HI>Man, that is born of a Woman, is of few days,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>IN the next place he turns his Tho'ts upon
<PB N="2" REF="002743_0003_0FE61F8FB5274108">
DEATH, &amp; affects him&s;elf with the dreadful Na|ture and Con&s;equences of it; groaning out his Soul in various Complaints, Reque&s;ts, and pa&s;&s;ionate Expo&s;tulations. He reali&s;es it to him&s;elf, that Death is an awful &amp; final Remove out of the Pre|&s;ent World; but then refre&s;hes him&s;elf with the Pro&s;pect of a future Re&s;urrection, &amp; his Exi&s;tence in another &amp; better World. ver. 7 &mdash; 15. <HI>For there is hope of a Tree, if it be cut down,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>HAVING &s;aid the&s;e things, he falls again into complaining Language; and tho' not utterly de&s;|perate, yet is hard put to it to bear up under his pre&s;ent Troubles. He complains of GOD's Sever|ity in his dealings with him, as if he was &s;trict to mark Iniquity again&s;t him; ver. 16, &amp; 17. <HI>For now thou numbre&s;t my &s;teps,</HI> &amp;c. In the next place he ob&s;erves the decaying Condition and Mutabili|ty of all Earthly Things: and then he &s;peaks of it as the common Lot of all Mankind to die; and mentions the power, the terror, and the agonies of Death: ver. 18. to the end, <HI>And &s;urely the mount|ain falling cometh to nought,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>ALL things in Nature are &s;ubject to continual Vici&s;&s;itudes, to Decays, and De&s;olations; even <HI>Man</HI> (the noble&s;t of vi&s;ible Creatures) not except|ed. We are of the Earth, earthy, &s;prang original|ly out of the Du&s;t, and mu&s;t return to our native Earth. The very <HI>Mountains</HI> &amp; <HI>Rocks</HI> have not &s;uch a Stability, but that they may be unfixed from their places, be removed &amp; broken to pieces, or gradually moulder away. No marvel then if frail Mankind be in a wa&s;ting Condition. The very &s;tronge&s;t, the mo&s;t healthy &amp; mo&s;t powerful among
<PB N="3" REF="002743_0004_0FE61F917519FE80">
Men, are &s;ubject to Mortality, as well as others. Tho' they &s;ee many days, &amp; la&s;t a long time, yet &s;ooner or later, they are worn out, as the Rocks in the Sea wax old and Stones wear away with the continual dropping of Water upon them. &mdash; And as to the Generality of Mankind, they are ea&s;ily carry'd away, &amp; often &s;uddenly, as Flowers of the Field, and tender Herbs which <HI>grow out of the dust of the Earth,</HI> by a &s;weeping Rain, which (as <HI>Solomon</HI> ob&s;erves) leaveth no Food, but cuts off the Expectations of the Husbandman, &amp; when he looketh for much, bringeth it to little.</P>
<P>THUS &s;aies <HI>Job,</HI> directing his Speech to the ALMIGHTY,&mdash; <HI>Thou wa&s;he&s;t away the things that grow out of the Du&s;t of the Earth; and thou de&s;troye&s;t the Hope of Man. Thou prevaile&s;t for ever again&s;t him,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>HERE (1.) WE have an acknowlegement of GOD's <HI>Dominion</HI> and Agency in the Affair of our <HI>Death. &mdash; Thou</HI> de&s;troye&s;t <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P N="2">(2.) WE have a <HI>De&s;cription</HI> of Death, by &s;ome of it's Properties, and Effects.</P>
<P>IN our Text he ob&s;erves, <HI>It de&s;troys the Hope of Man,</HI> puts a Period to all our Worldly Hopes and Projects, &amp; to the pre&s;umptuous hopes of the Hy|pocrite. In the following ver&s;es 'tis ob&s;erved:</P>
<P><HI>IT prevails for ever again&s;t him, and he pa&s;&s;eth away.</HI> The Stroke of Death is irre&s;i&s;tible, &amp; often makes quick di&s;patch. The Blow is many times given &s;uddenly, &amp; the Man pa&s;&s;es away; makes a &s;peedy flight, as a timorous Bird ha&s;tens out of it's Ne&s;t when di&s;turb'd, or as a conquer'd Soldier &s;lys before his pur&s;uing Adver&s;ary. &mdash; 'Tis added,</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="002743_0005_0FE61F9182603B08"><HI>IT changeth his Countenance</HI>; it's Approach is terrible, and di&s;compo&s;es the Mind; and it's Ex|ecution alters the looks, &s;lurs the Beauty of the Face, and turns it into Palene&s;s &amp; Deformity.</P>
<P><HI>IT &s;ends him away,</HI> &mdash; with Speed &amp; Force; out of Time into Eternity; out of a State of Pro|bation into a State of Retribution. Finally, <HI>His &s;ons come to Honour, and he knoweth it not, &amp; they are brought low, but he perceiveth it not,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>I &s;hall con&s;ider at pre&s;ent only the Beginning of the Account here given of Death. And &s;hall &s;peak to it under the&s;e two Ob&s;ervations.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. GOD is the Sovereign Di&s;pen&s;er of Death.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. DEATH de&s;troys the Hope of Man.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>PROP. I. <HI>GOD is the Sovereign Di&s;pen&s;er of Death,</HI> and the ab&s;olute Di&s;po&s;er of all the Circum|&s;tances and Con&s;equences of it.</P>
<P><HI>JOB</HI> attributes all to GOD, &mdash; <HI>Thou</HI> de&s;troye&s;t the Hope of Man; <HI>Thou</HI> prevaile&s;t for ever again&s;t him,&mdash; <HI>Thou</HI> change&s;t his Countenance, and &s;ende&s;t him away. &mdash; Thus he a&s;cribes this great Event, in the &s;everal Circum&s;tances &amp; Con&s;equents of it unto GOD.</P>
<P>AND this Truth might be confirm'd from ma|ny other Pa&s;&s;ages in &s;acred Writ. I &s;hall here only mention that one place, where GOD him&s;elf a&s;|&s;erts his Dominion over human Life, and challen|ges it as his Prerogative to di&s;po&s;e of it. Deut. 32.29. <HI>See now, that I even I am HE, and there is no God with me: I kill &amp; I make alive; I wound &amp; I heal; neither is there any that can deliver out of my
<PB N="5" REF="002743_0006_0FE61F9AC9CF7D68">
hand.</HI> He orders &amp; di&s;po&s;es every thing relating to the Death of every one; the Time, the Place, the Manner, together with all the Effects, and Things which follow.</P>
<P>DEATH is no contingent or accidental Event, the fruit of Chance, but the Re&s;ult of Divine Coun&s;il &amp; Efficiency. It may be &s;aid indeed to be fortuitous or ca&s;ual with re&s;pect to us, who are ignorant of futurities, and meet with many things we could not fore&s;ee, or did not expect. But GOD is perfect in Knowlege, &amp; fore&s;ees the mo&s;t di&s;tant Events; and with reference to him nothing can be call'd a Contingency, Accident, or Chance. He worketh All things according to the Coun&s;il of his own Will: &amp; in particular, He pre|&s;ides in the great affair of Death. Thus &s;aith <HI>Job,</HI> Chap. 12.9, 10. <HI>Who knoweth not in all the&s;e, that the hand of the Lord hath wrought this? In who&s;e hand is the Soul of every living thing, and the breath of all mankind.</HI> It is he turneth Man to De&s;truction, &amp; bringeth us to the Hou&s;e appointed for all Living. The Decree (wherein it's appoint|ed unto Man once to die) came out of his Mouth; and the Execution is done by his powerful Hand. Men don't die at random, ju&s;t when &amp; as it hap|pens: but our times are in GOD's hand; He mea&s;ures out our Life, &amp; determins our days; the number of our Months is with him; He hath ap|pointed our Bounds that we cannot pa&s;s. And when the &s;et time is come, he gives the fatal Blow, takes away our breath, and lays us in the du&s;t. There is the hand of GOD in every one's Death, whatever be the way, &amp; means; whether it be a
<PB N="6" REF="002743_0007_0FE61F9AD34939B0">
natural or a violent Death; by Di&s;tempers or Di&s;a&s;ters; if he be &s;lain in Battel, cut off by the Sword of Ju&s;tice, or &s;tab'd by an <HI>Ehud</HI>'s Dagger <HI>&amp;c.</HI> All comes to pa&s;s by the Determination &amp; Provi|dence of GOD. It was <HI>according to the determinate Coun&s;el &amp; Fore-knowledge of God,</HI> that our <HI>ble&s;&s;ed Saviour</HI> was by <HI>wicked Hands crucify'd &amp; &s;lain.</HI> GOD directed the Arrow, when a certain Man drew his bow <HI>at a venture,</HI> and &s;mote the King of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> between <HI>the Joynts of the Harne&s;s.</HI> <Q>It is appointed to us, not only once to die, but <HI>how</HI> and <HI>when</HI>: the particular Time of our <HI>Birth</HI> is not more fully &s;ettled in the Coun&s;els of GOD, than the Time of our <HI>Death.</HI></Q> There is a Time to be born, and a Time to die; a <HI>&s;et</HI> Time for both: and GOD <HI>determineth the Times fore-appointed.</HI> <Q>It is the &s;ame Invi&s;ible Hand, which <HI>writes down</HI> our Names in <HI>the Book of the Living,</HI> and <HI>blots</HI> them out too.</Q></P>
<P>THIS is a Truth we &s;hould often meditate upon; that GOD hath the power of Life &amp; Death; and we &s;hould make a wi&s;e application hereof to the Ends of Holine&s;s and &s;piritual Comfort.</P>
<P>THIS Reflection &s;hould &s;erve to <HI>greaten and elevate our Apprehen&s;ions of the Divine Maje&s;ty.</HI> Death is one of the weightie&s;t and mo&s;t important Events. 'Tis the De&s;truction of an human Body, which infinite Wi&s;dom hath fearfully and wonder|fully made. 'Tis the di&s;lodging of an immortal Soul; a changing of its State, &amp; tran&s;lating it from a world of Sen&s;e to a world of Spirits, from a State of Trial, to a State of Rewards unknown and ever|la&s;ting. It is therefore a great and very awful
<PB N="7" REF="002743_0008_0FE61F9C98266368">
Thing to die. And it is no &s;mall Exerci&s;e of the Divine Dominion, which is &s;een in this Affair. Hence we &s;hould maintain a profound Reverence of GOD, in who&s;e hand our Breath is, and &s;hould have exalted Tho'ts of Him on this account.</P>
<P><HI>Again,</HI> THE Thought of this &s;hould <HI>&s;trike a Ter|ror on rebellious Sinners, and excite them to a &s;peedy Repentance.</HI> This tells you, that your Lives are under a Divine In&s;pection, the mo&s;t &s;trict, ac|curate, and never-cea&s;ing. The LORD of all has his Eye upon you continually, ob&s;erving how you fill up the mea&s;ure of your Iniquity, and waiting the fit &s;ea&s;on to turn the Keys of Death &amp; Hell up|on you. O Con&s;ider this, &amp; tremble. Your Death will certainly be a mi&s;erable one, if you die in your Sins. And you know not how &s;oon or &s;uddenly you may have the fatal Summons &s;erv'd upon you. The Providence of GOD is at this day calling aloud on you in &s;everal &s;udden Deaths. It is owing intirely to the Patience &amp; Forbearance of a good and merciful GOD, that you are &s;pared, &amp; have had your Lives lengthen'd out hitherto. You are continually abu&s;ing this Patience by your Rebellion and Impenitence. And if you go on in your Tre&s;|pa&s;&s;es, there is hazard le&s;t abu&s;ed Patience &s;hould break out into inflamed Wrath, &amp; cut you down as Cumberers of the Ground, &amp; ca&s;t you as fit Fewel into the Everla&s;ting Burnings. GOD has &s;aid, <HI>My Spirit &s;hall not always &s;trive with man.</HI> O &s;ecure Sinners, think of this, &amp; tremble le&s;t Divine Vengence &s;hould kindle again&s;t you, &amp; burn to the lowe&s;t Hell. &mdash; The Doctrine before us reads loud Le&s;&s;ons of Terror to the Wicked. O that &s;uch
<PB N="8" REF="002743_0009_0FE61F9C9F771D60">
would hear &amp; fear &amp; no longer harden their Hearts, but to Day while it is called to day, hearken to the Ca&s;ts of the Go&s;pel, &amp; turn from their evil ways, that they peri&s;h not. But then further,</P>
<P>IT reads &s;weet Lectures of <HI>Con&s;olation to the Children of GOD.</HI></P>
<P>UNDER the Difficulties &amp; Troubles of Life, in <HI>general,</HI> it &s;hould mini&s;ter Support &amp; Comfort to Believers, to con&s;ider that GOD is the Sovereign LORD of Life &amp; Death. However your Lives may be embitter'd to you by a Variety of Afflictions; &s;o that you may be even weary of Life, and be tempted (with <HI>Job</HI>) to wi&s;h for Death, yet remem|ber it is GOD who continues your Lives, and de|lays your Death; HE performeth the Thing that is appointed for you; and let this Tho't teach you a humble Submi&s;&s;ion &amp; patient Waiting. And re|member that er'e long He will command Delive|rance for you; will give you a Quietus, and bring you to the Re&s;t which remains for the People of GOD. The pro&s;pect of this &s;hou'd calm your Spi|rit, and make you ea&s;y under all your pre&s;ent Trials &mdash;.</P>
<P>BUT in particular, under <HI>Bereavements,</HI> the Tho't of GOD's Dominion over Death &s;hould be quieting to you. <HI>Job</HI> compo&s;ed him&s;elf with this con&s;ideration, &mdash; <HI>The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away,</HI> (Job 1.21.) Let &s;uch as are Mourning under bereaving Di&s;pen&s;ations, eye the hand of GOD. You may not with the ignorant &amp; fooli&s;h <HI>Phili&s;tins</HI> make a Doubt, Whether it is GOD who hath done this Evil, or whether it is a Chance that hath happened to you. You mu&s;t not impute it to
<PB N="9" REF="002743_0010_0FE61FA771D8AA78">
&s;econd Cau&s;es merely; but look above &amp; beyond In&s;truments &amp; Means to the Prime Efficient, and acknowledge with <HI>Naomi,</HI> That <HI>the Hand of the Lord</HI> is gone out again&s;t you. Realize the Agency of Divine Providence in your Afflictions, and in the mid&s;t of your di&s;quieting Tho'ts within you, let this Reflection comfort you. Remember <HI>Who</HI> it is that has laid you under the&s;e bereavements. He is One ab&s;olutely <HI>Sovereign</HI> and giveth not ac|count of any of his Matters. Why then &s;houlde&s;t thou &s;trive again&s;t Him? Wo to him, who &s;triveth with his Maker! Behold, He taketh away, and who can hinder him, or who may &s;ay to him. What doe&s;t Thou? Behold in this thou art not ju&s;t: I will an&s;wer thee, That GOD is greater than Man! Again, He is One Infinitely <HI>Wife</HI>; and therefore knows what is be&s;t &amp; fitte&s;t to be done, and even how to bring Good out of Evil. Is it not then both a Duty and a Decency in you to acquie&s;ce in his Plea&s;ure, with the highe&s;t Satisfaction? Moreover, He is infinitely <HI>Good</HI> &amp; Gracious, and has engag'd him&s;elf by his faithful <HI>Promi&s;e,</HI> to employ his Wi&s;|dom &amp; Power in making all things work together for your final and be&s;t Advantage; &s;o that you &s;hall be &s;piritual Gainers by your temporal Lo&s;&s;es &amp; Bereavements. O how &s;hould this Tho't &s;u&s;tain, animate &amp; comfort you! I &s;hall only &s;ubjoyn, You may fetch in additional Con&s;olations from the pro&s;pect of that <HI>Happine&s;s</HI> &amp; <HI>Glory,</HI> which &s;uch of your decea&s;ed Friends, as were Pious, are gone to inherit, and which &s;hall be abundantly increa&s;ed at their future Re&s;urrection. It is GOD who has ta|ken them away; and you mu&s;t needs conclude
<PB N="10" REF="002743_0011_0FE61FA778CD1788">
from his Love to his People, and from his gracious Promi&s;es to them, that he has remov'd them into a State more excellent &amp; happy, than that they were in here; and that he will rai&s;e up their Bodies at the la&s;t day, to Glory, Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s &amp; Immortality. So that not a Tear nor Sigh is due on the &s;core of the departed Godly, who are plea&s;ed with the Change which we lament. Wherefore comfort one another with the&s;e words. Take them for a Spunge, to dry up all your exce&s;&s;ive Tears; and let not immoderate Re&s;entments prevail over you, to the di&s;honour of GOD, and the prejudice of your own Souls. At lea&s;t, let your Re&s;entments turn upon <HI>Sin,</HI> the grand Occa&s;ion &amp; Procurer of Death: <HI>Hear the Lord's Controver&s;y with you,</HI> and inquire into the Grounds of it; O humble your &s;elves un|der his mighty hand, and learn Righteou&s;ne&s;s from his Judgments; knowing that He will one day call you to an Account for your Afflictions, as &s;o many Talents, put into your Hands to improve for his Glory.</P>
<P>Further, THE Doctrine before us &s;hould teach us all to be <HI>Thankful to GOD for the Pre&s;ervation of our Lives hitherto,</HI> and <HI>to tru&s;t in him for the future Continuance of them.</HI> We live in the mid&s;t of dan|ger, are encompa&s;s'd with innumerable Evils; and it is of the Lord's Mercies we are not con&s;umed. To him give the Glory of pa&s;t Pre&s;ervations; and in him let us put our Confidence for the future. What Time we are afraid, let us tru&s;t in the Lord: when our Lives are in hazard by Sickne&s;s, by Ac|cidents, by the Rage of Creatures, let us confide in GOD, and be quiet from the fear of Death. If
<PB N="11" REF="002743_0012_0FE61FA886A9F2A8">
He cover us with his Feathers, we are &s;afe, and need not fear whrt Men or Devils can do unto us. Prov. 26.2. <HI>As the bird by wandring, as the &s;wallow by flying, &s;o the cur&s;e cau&s;ele&s;s &s;hall not come.</HI> We &s;hould tru&s;t in GOD as the GOD of our Life, for the pre&s;ervation of it, and for all the Ble&s;&s;ings need|ful to &s;weeten it to us: and we &s;hould re&s;ign to his Will, as to the Time &amp; Manner of our Death. We &s;hould daily by Faith be putting over our&s;elves into his &s;afe and glorious Hands, and commit the keeping of our Souls, and ordering of our Bodies and all our Concerns wholly unto Him; from a reali&s;ing view of his Sovereignty, Goodne&s;s, and Wi&s;dom.</P>
<P>Finally, WHAT has been &s;aid &s;hou'd <HI>give Check to all inordinate Fears of Men,</HI> however they may &s;et them&s;elves again&s;t us, or any of GOD's People. Are we apprehen&s;ive of Danger to our&s;elves, or to the Publick, or to the Church of GOD abroad, from &s;ubtil &amp; powerful Enemies? Do Tyrants &amp; Op|pre&s;&s;ors ari&s;e, and do they breathe out Threatnings and Slaughter? This is our Comfort, Their Breath (as well as ours) is in GOD's hand; and tho' they may be called gods, they &s;hall die like men. The LORD, when he plea&s;eth, can da&s;h them to pieces with his &s;trong Arm, and cover them with &s;hame, can bring down the glory of their high looks, and ca&s;t their Throne down to the Ground, by one ea&s;y in&s;tantaneous Blow, either with or without In|&s;truments. It was the Word of the LORD to the Prince of <HI>Tyre,</HI> Ezek. 28.8&mdash;10. <HI>They &s;hall bring thee down to the pit, and thou &s;halt die the deaths of them that are &s;lain in the mid&s;t of the &s;eas. Wilt

thou yet &s;ay before him that &s;layeth thee, I am God? but thou &s;halt be a man and no God in the hand of him that &s;layeth thee. Thou &s;halt die the deaths of the uncircumci&s;ed, by the hand of &s;trangers: for I have &s;poken it, &s;aith the Lord God. &mdash; Pharaoh,</HI> that oppre&s;&s;or of GOD's I&s;rael, was drowned in the Red Sea. So <HI>Herod</HI> the King who vexed the Church, was &s;mote by the Angel of the Lord, &amp; devoured of Worms. Thus tho&s;e Per&s;ecutors were &s;topt in their furious Career; by the Bla&s;t of GOD, they peri&s;h'd out of the Earth, &amp; went where the Wicked cea&s;e from troubling. Wait on the Lord then, &amp; keep his way. Fret not thy &s;elf becau&s;e of evil doors; neither be afraid of Dying Creatures tho' they plot again&s;t the ju&s;t, &amp; bend their Bow, to &s;lay &s;uch as be of upright Conver&s;ation. The wrath of Man &s;hall prai&s;e GOD, &amp; the Remainder thereof &s;hall be re&s;trained. Lo, I have &s;een the Wicked in great power &amp; &s;preading him&s;elf like a green Bay-Tree, yet he pa&s;&s;ed away; and lo, he was not. The Sal|vation of the Righteous is of the Lord, and unto GOD belong the I&s;&s;ues from Death, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 72.14. <HI>He &s;hall redeem their Soul from deceit and violence: and precious &s;hall their blood be in his &s;ight.</HI> 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 3.13, 14. <HI>And who is he that will harm you, if ye be followers of that which is good? But and if ye &s;uffer for righteou&s;ne&s;s &s;ake, happy are ye: and be not afraid of their terror, neither be troubled</HI>;</P>
<P>I come now to the other Ob&s;ervation.</P>

Hope in Chri&s;t and hope of Heaven [well grounded] Death will con&s;ummate and not de&s;troy.</Q> But it de&s;troys the Hope, which is Worldly or Fal&s;e. We read 1 <HI>Chron.</HI> 29.15. <HI>Our days on Earth are a &s;hadow, and there is none abiding,</HI> or no Expecta|tion, as it might be render'd, <HI>Prov.</HI> 11.7. <HI>When a wicked man dieth, his expectation &s;hall peri&s;h: and the hope of unju&s;t men peri&s;heth.</HI></P>
<P N="1">(1.) <HI>IT puts a period to all Worldly Projects, to all Earthly Hopes,</HI> and the pro&s;pects of Temporal Glory and Happine&s;s, which vain Man is &s;o apt to flatter him&s;elf with. Death puts an end to his tem|poral Life and Abode here on Earth; and together therewith, to all his Worldly Employments and De&s;igns, as well as Enjoyments and Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. Death turns us out of our &s;everal Callings, Relati|ons &amp; Secular Capacities, &amp; leaves us no more opportunity to attend the common works of Life, and pur&s;ue any de&s;igns relating to the pre&s;ent World. Thus we read, <HI>Eccle.</HI> 9.10. <HI>There is no work, nor device, nor knowlege, nor wi&s;dom in the grave whither thou goe&s;t.</HI> So P&s;al. 146.4. <HI>His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth: in that very day his thoughts peri&s;h.</HI> The meaning is not, that the Soul then pa&s;&s;es into a tho'tle&s;s, &s;tupid in|dolent State, &amp; lo&s;es its power of Cogitation, No, but it imports, that a Period is then put to the De|&s;igns they formed for this World. When Death comes, they can no longer pro&s;ecute the Schemes they have laid for Worldly Gains, Plea&s;ures or Pre|ferments.

In that very day the Plans they have laid peri&s;h: "their de&s;igns die with them, their Thoughts vani&s;h with their Breath! &mdash; In one Moment all their Hopes are da&s;h't; their De&s;ires, and their Expectations peri&s;h forever.</P>
<P>HENCE, <HI>Let us not put our Tru&s;t in Men</HI>; who&s;e Lives, however important &amp; u&s;eful, are un|certain; and therefore our Expectations from them very precarious, &amp; ea&s;ily defeated. Hear the Pro|phet's Advice, <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 2.2 2. <HI>Cea&s;e ye from man who&s;e breath is in his no&s;trils: for wherein is he to be ac|counted of</HI>? Surely Man is like to Vanity; his days are as a Shadow that pa&s;&s;eth away. Men of low degree are Vanity: and Men of high degree are a Lye. Hear the P&s;almi&s;t's Advice, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 146.3, 4, 5. <HI>Put not your trust in princes, nor in the &s;on of man, in whom there is no help. His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth: in that very day his thoughts peri&s;h. Happy is he that hath the God of Jacob for his help, who&s;e hope is in the Lord his God</HI>: "This is a Life, &amp; Will, &amp; Power we may depend upon".</P>
<P>Again, <HI>LET us not be high minded and tru&s;t in uncertain Riches.</HI> We mu&s;t not fix our De&s;ires and Hopes on the things of Time &amp; Sen&s;e: we mu&s;t not conceive too big Hopes, nor indulge too perempt|ory Expectations; but always project &amp; act with an ab&s;olute Re&s;ignation to GOD, &amp; &s;it loo&s;e from the World, as Pilgrims &amp; Strangers upon Earth. Let us not put on too much Confidence, nor flatter and plea&s;e our&s;elves too much with Worldly Hopes and Views at any time. Hear the Wi&s;e Man's Caution, Prov. 27.1, 24. <HI>Boa&s;t not thy &s;elf of to mor|row; for thou knowe&s;t not what a day may bring

<L>Each warm Affection, bu&s;y Thought,</L>
<L>And all my pa&s;&s;ing Hours.</L>
<L>I &s;hall be &s;afe, and rich, and ble&s;t,</L>
<L>If I belong to Thee:</L>
<L>Contented here I'll take my Re&s;t,</L>
<L>Thine let me ever be!</L>
<L>Thus &s;hall my heav'nly Hopes begin,</L>
<L>Thus I'll my Hopes maintain:</L>
<L>Nor once expect, in ways of Sin,</L>
<L>Eternal Life to gain.</L>
<L>O! let tho&s;e glorious Hopes refine,</L>
<L>And elevate my Soul;</L>
<L>To heav'nly Things my Heart incline,</L>
<L>And meaner Joys controul.</L>
<L>May Faith and Hope &s;tretch all their Wings,</L>
<L>And bear me up on high;</L>
<L>And as I mount, may Earthly Things,</L>
<L>Below unheeded lie!</L>
<L>JESUS, my Saviour and my God,</L>
<L>My Life and Sacrifice!</L>
<L>My Hopes, deep founded in thy Blood,</L>
<L>Rai&s;e far above the Skies.</L>
<L>Prepare me, Lord, for thy Right Hand,</L>
<L>Then come the joyful Day:</L>
<L>Come Death, and come Cele&s;tial Band,</L>
<L>To bear my Soul away.</L>
