<HEAD>AN ELECTION SERMON.</HEAD>
<P><HI>As we are convened with our civil fathers to pay our religious acknowledgments to the Deity, and to in|quire in his temple, the theme for our contempla|tion, which I have &s;elected from the &s;acred pages, is this&mdash;</HI></P>
<Q><BIBL>PROVERBS III.6.</BIBL>
IN ALL THY WAYS ACKNOWLEDGE HIM, AND HE SHALL DI|RECT THY PATHS.</Q>
<P>THIS re&s;pected audience will ea&s;ily forgive the omi&s;&s;ion, if they &s;hould hear nothing &s;aid at this time concerning the nece&s;&s;ity, the origin, or the nature of civil government; nor of the particular kind which is mo&s;t eligible, and mo&s;t conducive to the happine&s;s of a &s;tate or nation: Things which have been often attempted on &s;uch occa&s;ions, and by tho&s;e who were thought equal to the undertaking. Neither will it be &s;o requi&s;ite to point out tho&s;e qualifications which
<PB N="6" REF="026855_0005_0FD23967AECA1A88">
the delegated electors ought to regard in tho&s;e whom they, &s;et up as rulers, as in tho&s;e times when one whole branch of the legi&s;lative body were cho&s;en by the a&s;&s;embled repre&s;entatives, on this anniver&s;ary. Accordingly a &s;ubject is cho&s;en which does not lead to the&s;e things; but to &s;hew the nece&s;&s;ity of paying a due regard to the mo&s;t high God; and which con|tains an important encouragement to our &s;o doing.</P>
<P>THE words <HI>ways,</HI> and <HI>paths,</HI> in the text, are ea&s;ily under&s;tood as applied to a man's conduct in the cour&s;e of his life; to that of one as much as another, whatever may be his &s;tation; &s;o that the admini&s;tra|tion of the affairs of government is included.</P>
<P>IF any &s;uch per&s;ons can be found, as deny, or di&s;|believe, the exi&s;tence of the Divine Being, they are farthe&s;t of all men from complying with the duty re|quired in the text. But it may ju&s;tly be doubted whether any rational human creature has lived and died under &s;uch a delu&s;ion. The opinion can only be founded in folly. <HI>The fool hath &s;aid in his heart there is no God</HI>; and of &s;uch only it is to be expected, who are either naturally wanting in under&s;tanding, or who have greatly abu&s;ed and ob&s;cured the light of rea&s;on and con&s;cience by &s;in. <HI>For by the things that are made,</HI> and mu&s;t have been created by him, <HI>are clearly &s;een, and under&s;tood, his eternal power and God|head.</HI> The exi&s;tence of things, not eternal nor &s;elf|created, mu&s;t lead us to believe in one who is &s;elf-ex|i&s;tent,
<PB N="7" REF="026855_0006_0FD23938FAD57A48">
without beginning, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of all perfect|ions.</P>
<P>BUT the acknowledgment of this truth, That God is, cannot be all, nor the principal thing which is re|quired. For by this the generality of mankind are but little, if at all, di&s;tingui&s;hed one from another.</P>
<P>THE belief of God's governing providence over all his works is undoubtedly included; and the oral profe&s;&s;ion of this belief is not excluded. For it would be irrational to &s;uppo&s;e that the Almighty Cre|ator of the univer&s;e has no governing influence over the work of his own hands.</P>
<P>WE do not deny that Omnipotence, directed by in|finite wi&s;dom, is equal to the ta&s;k of making a mo&s;t huge and complicated <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> which &s;hould need no direction, or &s;upport, after the original impul&s;e, in order to an&s;wer innumerable wi&s;e ends in its crea|tion. But that he has done this in the &s;tructure of the material univer&s;e, it is impo&s;&s;ible to prove. Much has been di&s;covered by philo&s;ophers, concerning the laws of matter and motion. But the mo&s;t &s;agacious theori&s;t could never a&s;&s;ign any phy&s;ical cau&s;e of grav|itation, which probably pervades all matter, and di|rects its motions: But have confe&s;&s;ed that this uni|ver&s;al property, or affection, may be no other than a con&s;tant energy of the Supreme Being, If this is the ca&s;e, or allowed to be &s;o, the reality of a divine prov|idence
<PB N="8" REF="026855_0007_0FD2393F90CEA490">
is not to be denied, or doubted. He that &s;tands at helm, we may &s;ay, directs the &s;hip and governs its motions.</P>
<P>IN language of in&s;piration, God is &s;aid to <HI>uphold all things by the word of his power</HI>; and without him, it is a&s;&s;erted, that not even a &s;parrow dies. How much more then mu&s;t the noble&s;t of his vi&s;ible creatures, and their affairs, be under his direction? Tho&s;e crea|tures of God which are fitted to act morally, from motive and choice, are evidently under his governing influence. This appears from his impo&s;ing &s;y&s;tems of laws to regulate their conduct; from his promi&s;es and threatenings, of rewards to the obedient, and puni&s;hments to the rebellious; from the promi&s;ed a&s;&s;i&s;tances of his Holy Spirit, and the mini&s;tration of the cele&s;tial angels to the heirs of &s;alvation. By the divine agency, either directly or through his instru|ments, the meek are guided in judgment; and even the hearts of kings, however &s;tubborn, are turned by the Monarch of the univer&s;e, as the rivers of wa|ter.</P>
<P>AND if individual per&s;ons are under the divine guidance, the &s;ame is &s;urely the ca&s;e of &s;tates and communities, which are compo&s;ed of individuals. The&s;e are equally fit &s;ubjects of the divine government, and would be equally unhappy in the want of it. Accordingly we are a&s;&s;ured in holy writ, that <HI>the kingdom is the Lord's,</HI> and that <HI>he is the Governor a|mong
<PB N="9" REF="026855_0008_0FD2394147C75540">
the nation.</HI> With good rea&s;on then do his &s;er|vants believe in his governing providence, as exerci&s;|ed in this inferior world.</P>
<P>PRAYER is al&s;o a fit acknowledgment of the Dei|ty. Men &s;hould &s;o depend upon the divine influence, and be &s;o affected with a per&s;ua&s;ion of it, as to apply to him for guidance, in all their important affairs and transactions, <HI>In all thy ways acknowledge him.</HI> This will be following the divine direction in other parts of the &s;acred volume; and the laudable examples of the devoted &s;ervants of God, both in ancient and modern times.</P>
<P>AND this &s;eeking to God for direction is not only the duty and privilege of the common people, but more e&s;pecially of tho&s;e who are called to guide the &s;tate, and admini&s;ter the great affairs of the publick. For the&s;e men act not only for them&s;elves, but for the whole community. So that errors in their conduct may be mo&s;t exten&s;ively hurtful and pernicious. And que&s;tions come before them in the cour&s;e of their bu&s;ine&s;s, not only of great weight and impor|tance, but often very complicated and perplexed. And as the con&s;cience of a good ruler will not allow him to act and determine by gue&s;s, or at random; how great need has he, not only of exerting his own be&s;t abilities, but of &s;upplicating the friendly aid of one, in whom are boundle&s;s trea&s;ures of wi&s;dom and knowledge, and who cannot err in judgment? Every
<PB N="10" REF="026855_0009_0FD2291747362930">
pious ruler is convinced of his need of a&s;&s;i&s;tance from on high; and will gladly make u&s;e of his privilege to repair to the throne of grace for this favour, in the arduous affairs of government. Mo&s;es affords &s;uch an example to human governors. He was wont to apply to God for direction, in guiding his refractory people. And Solomon, when a choice of divine fa|vours was offered him, &s;upplicated for wi&s;dom and under&s;tanding, to enable him to manage the affairs of his government.</P>
<P>I TRUST I am not &s;peaking to tho&s;e who will &s;ay in their hearts, <HI>What profit &s;hall we have, if we pray unto him?</HI> The duty of prayer is not only enjoined re|peatedly in the oracles of God; but clearly dictated by the light of nature, as appears from the conduct of the heathen mariners with Jonah. There cannot be a more rea&s;onable &s;ervice. But for our a&s;&s;urance of gracious an&s;wers to our prayers, we are mo&s;tly, if not wholly, beholden to divine revelation. By this we learn that God is nigh unto all that call upon him, or invoke him with &s;incerity; and that, if we implore his aid in ca&s;es of difficulty, he will direct our paths.</P>
<P>THOUGH the intention and u&s;e of prayer cannot be to inform the omni&s;cient Being of our wants, nor to alter the purpo&s;es of our unchangeable benefactor, there is &s;till a connection between a&s;king and receiv|ing his favours. And this devout exerci&s;e will hap|pily &s;erve to keep up in our minds a &s;en&s;e of his a|gency,
<PB N="11" REF="026855_0010_0FD2398852DE2B70">
and of our wants and dependence; and pre|pare us for the right reception and improvement of what he be&s;tows.</P>
<P>THERE are many ways in which he can give us a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance and direction, be&s;ides doing it by the immediate agency of his Spirit. And his power of doing the lat|ter none will dare to di&s;pute. The almighty agent, who created the human &s;oul, has a more near and imme|diate acce&s;s to it than any creature can have; &s;o that he can excite in men &s;uch ideas, and lead them into &s;uch trains of thought, as &s;hall influence their actions in perfect con&s;i&s;tency with their moral agency, and ac|countablene&s;s for their conduct.</P>
<P>BUT a practical acknowledgment of the Deity in|cludes, al&s;o, a profound &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to his authority over us, and a voluntary obedience to his command|ments. What will it avail for men to profe&s;s that he has in his hands, by right, and in fact, the government of the world, if they oppo&s;e their wills and actions to his infinite authority? Or, of what account will be their belief of his exi&s;tence, &s;o long as they allow them&s;elves to live in practical athei&s;m? It is a ve|ry bad character, given of &s;ome who profe&s;s to know God, that in their works they deny him, being abom|inable and di&s;obedient, and to every good work re|probate.</P>
<P>THIS practical acknowledgment of God is the highe&s;t intere&s;t, and the unque&s;tionable duty of all
<PB N="12" REF="026855_0011_0FD239498AB13E60">
men. And all the wi&s;e and good rejoice in the di|vine commandments; accounting the &s;ervice of God as better than freedom; and take delight in conform|ing them&s;elves to their knowledge of his will, as it is conducive to his honour, and to the re&s;toration and felicity of their lap&s;ed nature. But the impen|itent and disobedient di&s;reli&s;h the divine government, placing the mo&s;t of their happine&s;s in &s;ecular and li|centious, immoral, and ungodly conduct: And, re|gardle&s;s of the divine forewarnings and threatenings, r;u&s;h headlong in the way to perdition.</P>
<P>FROM the doctrines contained in the &s;ubject, civil rulers may be led to ob&s;erve &s;omething of the nature of their duty towards God. As men, they are on the &s;ame footing as others; equally bound to the ac|knowledgment of the Deity, in all the ways that are dictated by rea&s;on and revelation. They &s;hould al&s;o remember that, as they are mini&s;ters of God, and his repre&s;entatives, it is of high importance that they be followers of him in all his moral perfections and ac|tions, as far as their ability extends; e&s;pecially in their conduct towards men. Otherwi&s;e they will be unfit to be con&s;idered as earthly Gods. They are &s;et in con&s;picuous places; and have it in their power to be exten&s;ively beneficial to mankind, by their pious and virtuous examples. They &s;hould not only &s;ub|mit them&s;elves, in all their conduct, to the divine com|mandments, but exhibit in their lives bright patterns of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the good laws of men. If private
<PB N="13" REF="026855_0012_0FD23967B1A92280">
Chri&s;tians are &s;acredly bound to &s;hew forth the virtues of him who has called them, and to &s;hine as lights in the world; much more is it requi&s;ite in men who are ve&s;ted with civil authority. For their good examples will be far more influential on mankind, than the ex|amples of tho&s;e in the lower walks of life. Mankind are ambitious of imitating the conduct of their &s;upe|riors. And as the talent is given to magi&s;trates, in, this way to be publick benefactors, they &s;hould con|&s;ider that they mu&s;t be an&s;werable to the &s;upreme gov|ernor, if they are found guilty of the non-improve|ment of it. For they mu&s;t be viewed as di&s;regard|ing the divine authority, unle&s;s they comply with this duty; and may ju&s;tly expect the fate of the unprofit|able &s;ervant.</P>
<P>THEY mu&s;t enact no laws but &s;uch as have the pub|lick welfare for their object: For God inve&s;ts them with no authority, but to do good.</P>
<P>BUT if, in&s;tead of practically acknowledging the divine authority over them, they take advantage from their promotion to affront and provoke him, by op|pre&s;&s;ing the people, or neglecting to &s;erve them; and by wicked examples encourage immorality and un|godline&s;s; what account will they be able to give of them&s;elves to their ma&s;ter in heaven?</P>
<P>POSSESSION of the publick power is attended with &s;ome peculiar temptations. It enables men, in &s;ome ca&s;es, to commit wickedne&s;s with impunity. Tho&s;e
<PB N="14" REF="026855_0013_0FD2291AC93CF5B0">
who hold the reins of government can defraud the in|nocent of their ju&s;t dues, and e&s;tabli&s;h iniquity by laws. They can &s;ecure to them&s;elves the emoluments of their office, without performing its duties accord|ing to the intention, and ju&s;t expectation of their elec|tors. They have opportunity to influence in the ap|pointment of unfit per&s;ons to &s;erve in the judicial and executive departments of government; and to keep out tho&s;e of better characters, for the &s;ake of bribes, the pro&s;pect of advantages to them&s;elves or families, or through prejudice and party &s;pirit. That tho&s;e who are drawn a&s;ide from the path of duty by &s;uch &s;ini&s;ter motives are un&s;it for the high employment of legi&s;la|tion, and guiding the affairs of a State, cannot be di&s;|puted. In&s;tead of approving them&s;elves as the min|i&s;ters of God for the good of the people, they may be con&s;idered as emi&s;&s;aries of &s;atan, and &s;courges of the publick. Such men do not acknowledge the di|vine Being. They are de&s;titute of religious rever|ence towards him; and the language of their con|duct is, that they will not have him to reign over them.</P>
<P>ALSO, the duty of rulers to mankind, and in par|ticular to tho&s;e who ve&s;t them with authority, is de|ducible from the &s;ubject. If they have a due regard to the Deity, they will make u&s;e of their power and authority as he requires, no otherwi&s;e than to pro|mote the happine&s;s of &s;ociety. The latter cannot but flow from the former; and where the latter is not, a
<PB N="15" REF="026855_0014_0FD2396A591A54A0">religious regard to the Deity has no place. For an Apo&s;tle of Chri&s;t has well &s;aid, <HI>If a man love not his brother whom he hath &s;een, how can he love God whom he hath not &s;een?</HI></P>
<P>PHILANTHROPY is a Chri&s;tian virtue of e&s;&s;ential importance; and in men of publick character it is in|di&s;pen&s;ably requi&s;ite to their an&s;wering the de&s;igns of their appointment. Patrioti&s;m is the branch of it which &s;hould be a &s;triking trait in their character. The worthy magi&s;trate will therefore bear it in mind that he is put into office to promote the welfare of the community, and of that particular part of which he is &s;trictly a member. This is not only the great de&s;ign of God, but of man, in his appointment. No free people are &s;uppo&s;ed to elect a ruler for any different purpo&s;e. He will therefore endeavour, in all his of|ficial conduct, to promote the public welfare. As a legi&s;lator he will give his vote for the enacting of no laws, and the annexing of no &s;anctions, but &s;uch as he is convinced will be conducive to the good of the publick, let who will be in favour of them. For though he ought to weigh with candour all that may be &s;aid again&s;t his opinion, after all he mu&s;t act ac|cording to the dictates of his own rea&s;on and con|&s;cience. He is principally an&s;werable to God, and to the vicegerent of God in his own bo&s;om.</P>
<P>AND as a friend to &s;ociety, &s;uch a ruler will think it of importance to prevent, as far as may be, the in|tricacy
<PB N="16" REF="026855_0015_0FD2291D4C959E60">and ob&s;curity in the language of laws, which may render them perplexing and en&s;naring to the common people.</P>
<P>IN the repealing of laws, he mu&s;t be actuated by the &s;ame con&s;cientious and benevolent principles. And there may be as real occa&s;ions for unmaking old, as for making new laws and regulations. By means of changes in the circum&s;tances of a commu|nity, tho&s;e which were once good and nece&s;&s;ary may become unfit and inexpedient. And if antiquated and u&s;ele&s;s laws, or even any which cannot be put into execution, are &s;uffered to &s;tand unrepealed, it may be que&s;tioned whether they do not operate to the weakening of the hands of government; or lead &s;ubjects to di&s;obey the be&s;t laws with hopes of im|punity.</P>
<P>THE worthy magi&s;trate will be &s;o tender of the publick welfare, that he will be careful to inform him&s;elf of the true characters of candidates for &s;ub|ordinate offices, knowing that vicious and ungodly men ought never, unle&s;s in ca&s;es of nece&s;&s;ity, to be entru&s;ted with power; le&s;t they &s;hould &s;o abu&s;e it as to bring &s;candal upon government, and mi&s;chief up|on the people. And being acquainted with their characters, he will not countenance their being put into places of honour or tru&s;t; nor will he connive at the continuance of &s;uch per&s;ons in office. The &s;ubordinate officers which Mo&s;es was advi&s;ed to con|&s;titute,
<PB N="17" REF="026855_0016_0FD2395E70EFEC70">
were not only to be able men, capable of performing the duties of their &s;tation, but &s;uch as feared God, and were men of truth, hating covet|ou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P>GOOD rulers will be actuated by &s;uch a care for the happine&s;s of the community, that they will u&s;e their wi&s;dom to explore ways and means to alleviate the publick burdens, and the hard&s;hips which chance to fall upon individuals, or on particular orders of men; impo&s;e no burdens without real nece&s;&s;ity, for the &s;upport of government, for the defence of the State, or the increa&s;e of publick happine&s;s on the whole. And they will &s;tudy to call for &s;uch contri|butions only, as can be made in the mo&s;t ea&s;y, peace|able and imperceptible manner.</P>
<P>IT may be expected of them that they be encour|agers and &s;upporters of the means of education, by good laws, and by &s;uch e&s;tabli&s;hments and endow|ments as appear fit and needful. E&s;pecially this will be done by intelligent republican rulers; as on it de|pend the peace, pro&s;perity, and perpetuity of the State: How ea&s;ily might an ignorant people be ex|cited by an eloquent demagogue to rebel again&s;t &s;uch a government, and introduce anarchy, confu&s;ion and ruin? How unqualified are &s;uch a people to elect able rulers, and &s;uch as are fit to be entru&s;ted with authority? They will &s;et up men who are like them|&s;elves, through partiality, or ignorance, or from the
<PB N="18" REF="026855_0017_0FD2393A5E331058">
nece&s;&s;ity of the ca&s;e. And when the blind have blind leaders, all will be confounded together.</P>
<P>IT may be &s;aid, to the honour of our con&s;titution of government, that civil rulers are happily re&s;trained by it from the abu&s;e of power; and in particular, from interfering with the rights of con&s;cience. So long as they make this their directory, &s;ubjects need be under no di&s;mal apprehen&s;ions of oppre&s;&s;ion. But &s;hall magi&s;trates make no u&s;e at all of authority with re&s;pect to religion and morality? It is agreed that it would be going beyond their line to do anything of this &s;ort, more than is perfectly con&s;i&s;tent, with the &s;a|cred rights of con&s;cience. For, as Chri&s;tians, we are under the government of Chri&s;t; and civil rul|ers, as &s;uch, have no authority in his kingdom. And yet they may, and they ought to be, nur&s;ing fathers to the church of Chri&s;t. They may &s;ecure to Chri&s;t|ians the enjoyment of the rights of con&s;cience; pre|vent their being interrupted in the exerci&s;e of their religion; and enable Chri&s;tian &s;ocieties to rai&s;e con|tributions among them&s;elves, to &s;erve religious pur|po&s;es. And if, with political views, they may enforce the &s;upport of &s;chools for the in&s;truction of youth, why not that of meetings for the in&s;truction of grown up children in religion and morality, &s;o far as they &s;hall judge it needful to promote the welfare of &s;ociety? Why not oblige a di&s;hone&s;t per&s;on to attend the&s;e meetings, of the denomination he prefers, if it were only to prevent his invading the property of his
<PB N="19" REF="026855_0018_0FD239615F903728">
Chri&s;tian neighbours, while they are at the place of publick wor&s;hip? And why not con&s;train the pro|fane per&s;on to do the &s;ame, in hope that he may learn to be afraid of perjury, the practice of which vice would be pernicious to a community, as it would render good government impracticable. All that is indi&s;putably beneficial to &s;ociety, and con&s;i&s;tent with the rights of individuals, is within their line. And good in&s;tructions in piety and morality are &s;o evi|dently of this &s;ort, that they have been adopted by the mo&s;t applauded of ancient governments.</P>
<P>WE rejoice with our honoured rulers this day, in the peace, independence, and pro&s;perity of our State and Nation. And we look back with plea&s;ure, and devout gratitude to the Supreme Ruler of e|vents, on the &s;nares which we have e&s;caped. The Lord was on our &s;ide, when men ro&s;e up again&s;t us. As by Mo&s;es he delivered his cho&s;en people from E|gyptian bondage; &s;o he rai&s;ed up a leader to our forces, of like wi&s;dom and patriotick zeal, who&s;e name will be equally known to future generations.</P>
<P>OUGHT we not to be the more &s;en&s;ibly affected with our deliverance, and the obtainment and &s;ecurity of our rights, when we con&s;ider with what amazing dif|ficulties a great and powerful nation, in alliance with us, have been &s;truggling, to obtain and &s;ecure the &s;ame rights, and a free government, of which we are in the peaceable po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion? May all their wi&s;e
<PB N="20" REF="026855_0019_0FD239531D6033E0">
de&s;igns, and laudable endeavours, be crowned with happy &s;ucce&s;s; and tho&s;e individuals among them, and nations around them, who have unrighteou&s;ly op|po&s;ed their de&s;ign of reforming their national govern|ment, be convinced of the evil of their conduct. Are the governors of that afflicted nation charged with cruelty, on account of the multitude of capital pun|i&s;hments? The blame of this &s;hould partly fall on their wicked invaders, who&s;e bloody on&s;ets and in|&s;idious intrigues, have encouraged many to engage in in&s;urrections, trea&s;ons and rebellions, by which they forfeit their lives. What degrees of lenity might have been exerci&s;ed towards offenders, con|&s;i&s;tently with the &s;afety of the State, perhaps it is very difficult for us at this di&s;tance to determine. Whil&s;t, as true republicans we cannot but approve their glorious de&s;ign, we may &s;ay they have probably fallen into great errors, in their zealous pur&s;uit of it. Nor is it to be expected that their powers will be in the be&s;t manner directed, till they more devoutly ac|knowledge the government of him who is over all. It was right to reject an ab&s;urd &s;pecies of Chri&s;tiani|ty; and it is hoped that a better one will be &s;oon a|dopted.</P>
<P>THE union of our States &s;eems to be &s;ettled on an immoveable ba&s;is; and our rapid increa&s;e promi&s;es to give us national con&s;equence and re&s;pectability. We fore&s;ee nothing to prevent it, under the wi&s;e con|duct of a &s;upreme executive in whom all hearts are
<PB N="21" REF="026855_0020_0FD2393CA503DC50">
united; nor &s;o long as the &s;pirit of mutual conde|&s;cen&s;ion is cultivated among the States. The nation|al con&s;titution, &s;o generally approved, may be viewed as a band of that la&s;ting union, which cannot be too zealou&s;ly cultivated. That &s;aying &s;hould not be for|gotten, By uniting we &s;tand, by dividing we fall.</P>
<P>THIS re&s;pectable State, in particular, has rea&s;on to rejoice in the enjoyment of its rights, and of a happy republican government. Our con&s;titution does hon|our to its framers; approaches &s;o near to perfection; and has hitherto &s;o well an&s;wered the wi&s;e purpo&s;es of its formation, that it can hardly be thought advi&s;|able to put our&s;elves to the expen&s;e and trouble of a revi&s;al. It would be very uncertain whether any real amendment would, on the whole, be obtained.</P>
<P>WITH plea&s;ure we behold a re&s;pectable delegation from the various parts of this exten&s;ive Common|wealth, for the purpo&s;e of tran&s;acting the important publick bu&s;ine&s;s of the pre&s;ent year. May the&s;e cho&s;|en patriots be actuated by a noble zeal to promote the publick welfare, and may heaven vouch&s;afe to di|rect all their &s;teps. May they act in the fear of God, as they are accountable to him for their conduct. For though, on account of their &s;tation, they are con&s;id|ered as children of the mo&s;t high, they &s;hall die like other men; and after death is the judgment.</P>
<P>AND here we cannot refrain from condolence with our political fathers on a melancholy event, which has
<PB N="22" REF="026855_0021_0FD23962DADDBF20">taken place &s;ince our la&s;t anniver&s;ary election; the removal of that di&s;tingui&s;hed per&s;on, and illu&s;trious republican, who has &s;o long &s;at, and with &s;o much dignity, in the chief &s;eat of government. May his uniform and inextingui&s;hable love of his country, and attachment to the rights of mankind; and not le&s;s his regard for the in&s;titutions of religion, and friend&s;hip to the teachers of it, be remembered, and emulated by tho&s;e who &s;hall hereafter be called to fill his important &s;tation. Long will his philanthropy, genero&s;ity and munificence, be had in remembrance. E&s;pecially will the numerous partakers of his boun|ty ri&s;e up and call his memory ble&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>WE rejoice to &s;ee his venerable copatriot now in the place of fir&s;t magi&s;trate; a gentleman of well known, and long approved ability and virtue; who early took an active part towards the accompli&s;hment of our happy revolution. May the &s;upreme Governor take him into his holy keeping: And, as he will not fail to acknowledge God, &s;o may he be favoured with all needful divine direction, in the duties of his arduous office. Having always de&s;erved well of the publick, he will experience the mo&s;t agreeable re|ward, by having his power of doing good increa&s;ed. May his life and u&s;efulne&s;s be protracted, that he may long rejoice in the gladne&s;s of our nation. And in the clo&s;ing &s;cene may his peaceful con&s;cience antici|pate that joyful plaudit, which all the faithful &s;hall receive from the great Judge of the world.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="026855_0022_0FD23954CE6977E8">THE re&s;pected, and much honoured gentlemen, who are elected to form the two branches of the le|gi&s;lature, have received a recent te&s;timony of the confidence of the people in their integrity and abili|ties, which we tru&s;t will not be abu&s;ed nor di&s;ap|pointed. As you are ve&s;ted with the power of the &s;tate, and con&s;tituted guardians of its precious rights, your God, your con&s;ciences, and your &s;acred oaths, oblige you to u&s;e your be&s;t endeavours to promote the political good of this people. Your betru&s;tment is great, and part of your work may be very diffi|cult, at this eventful era, when our affairs are &s;o much embarra&s;&s;ed by means of the war that rages in Europe, and the depredations in the We&s;t Indies, by which we greatly &s;uffer. If you find that you need wi&s;dom, you are to a&s;k it of him who is the fountain of it, and an&s;wers the prayers of all who ac|knowledge him aright. In the elections of this day may you be under a divine guidance, and in all the bu&s;ine&s;s of your &s;e&s;&s;ions through the year.</P>
<P>PERSUADED of the purity of your intentions, the preacher will not pre&s;ume to be your dictator, in a line that is out of his profe&s;&s;ion: But would humbly recommend to your paternal attention a few things, which to him appear to be of &s;ome political import|ance.</P>
<P>IF practicable, it &s;eems de&s;irable that &s;omething may be done towards putting into full execution the
<PB N="24" REF="026855_0023_0FD2397DE90F42D0">
law re&s;pecting &s;chools; that the ri&s;ing generation may become po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of tho&s;e advantages, which were anxiou&s;ly de&s;ired by the framers of it, and which can|not but be thought important by an enlightened re|publick. And whether &s;ome harmle&s;s alteration might not render the law more ea&s;y to be enforced, is &s;ubmitted to your wi&s;e con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>OUR civil fathers will al&s;o con&s;ider whether the means of defence ought not to be more attended to, than they have hit her to been; as we know not what alarms may come, nor what enemy may next be di&s;po&s;ed to invade us&mdash;whether military &s;kill &s;hould not be more a&s;&s;idu|ou&s;ly cultivated&mdash;and the militia kept on the mo&s;t re&s;pectable footing, that we may not be wholly un|ready to repel an inva&s;ion&mdash;And whether, in our pre&s;|ent a&s;pect of affairs, escouragement &s;hould not be af|forded to the general government, not only for pro|tecting our navigation and commerce from piratical depredations; but for the &s;peedy erection of forts and batteries, on our expo&s;ed maritime borders. A little delay, with re&s;pect to the la&s;t of the&s;e objects, may lead to tragical and di&s;tre&s;&s;ing &s;cenes. What other nation is contented with &s;o defencele&s;s a coa&s;t?</P>
<P>FRUGALITY, indu&s;try and economy are to be con|&s;idered as excellent virtues in the inhabitants of any State. For without the&s;e no country arrives at opu|lence; nor without their continuance, will depopu|lation and wretchedne&s;s be prevented, much more

are they needful in a young country, with low finan|ces, and which has yet done &s;o little towards provid|ing for the publick &s;afety and defence, the&s;e virtues are evangelical, as well as political, and e&s;&s;ential parts of that righteou&s;ne&s;s which exalts a nation. The want of them would effectually prevent our growing into that re&s;pectability, which we have been fondly anticipating in expectation. But why, in the name of rea&s;on, will we keep our&s;elves low, by eagerly im|porting and purcha&s;ing the trifling manufactures of di&s;tant nations? Po&s;&s;ibly our political guardians, without the enaction of &s;umptuary laws, may devi&s;e &s;ome means to check the rage for foreign &s;uperfluities, which is complained of by many as too prevalent, and of a pernicious tendency.</P>
<P>IN &s;ub&s;erviency to &s;uch a de&s;ign, might not &s;everal new manufactories be erected, and fo&s;tered by the hand of government, to &s;upply the people, not only with nece&s;&s;ary things, but with &s;ome that are elegant and ornamental? the natural con&s;equence would be, preventing much of our wealth from taking wing, and flying to the tran&s;atlantick regions.</P>
<P>THE government in time pa&s;t has done honour to it&s;elf, by their kindne&s;s and a&s;&s;i&s;tance to the univer|&s;ity in this vicinity. You will consider what further help it may need, to continue and increa&s;e its impor|tance,

and u&s;efulne&s;s to the publick.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">BY means of the taking down of one of the buildings, that seat of learning has not been &s;ufficient, for &s;everal years pa&s;t, to lodge all the &s;tudents.

If the we&s;tern has been thus favoured, why &s;hould not the oriental be attended to? Though, while the &s;ettlers are mo&s;tly emigrants from the older parts of the Commonwealth, a few men of erudition may happen to be found among them; what pro&s;pects can we have concerning the next and future generations? The need of erudition &s;eems greater in a region bor|dering on provinces of Britain, where principles of kingly government prevail; that the corruption and defection of the people may be effectually, and for|ever prevented.</P>
<P>IT is pre&s;umed that you need not be reminded to con&s;ult the honour and credit of government, by a punctual fulfilment of all the obligations the State is under; and render to all what they have a ju&s;t right

to expect. The &s;peaker dares not affront you &s;o much as to &s;ugge&s;t a &s;u&s;picion that you will take ad|vantage of your high authority to practice iniquity. Chri&s;tian rulers are not di&s;po&s;ed to injure the ene|mies of the State; how much le&s;s its friends and &s;up|porters, its &s;ervants and defenders? For they will con&s;ider that contracts are as much binding in the &s;ight of God, upon States and corporate bodies, as upon individuals; and that no fraudulent machiavel|lian policy may be expected to pro&s;per.</P>
<P>THE addre&s;s now turns to my fellow citizens of every rank, who are here a&s;&s;embled. As we wi&s;h and pray for the continuance and increa&s;e of publick pro&s;|perity, it is incumbent on us that, regarding the di|vine authority, we do all in our power to &s;trengthen the hands of the government we are providentially under. It is not enough that we elect wi&s;e and faith|ful men, to conduct the affairs of the publick. It be|comes us to pay a &s;acred regard to the laws; &s;o as neither to violate them our&s;elves, nor encourage oth|ers in doing it. Tho&s;e who offend again&s;t the pub|lick authority &s;hould be rebuked and puni&s;hed, that others may not dare to follow their example. And no improper fear of being per&s;ecuted as informers &s;hould deter any from cau&s;ing offenders again&s;t our good government to be detected. If no zeal nor courage were wanting, in giving a&s;&s;i&s;tance to the ci|vil power, government would di&s;cover its full energy, and happy effects; and comparatively few would be
<PB N="28" REF="026855_0027_0FD2396519EC1008">
mole&s;ted in the enjoyment of their rights. It is not the want of good laws, &s;o much as the want of virtue in the &s;ubjects to give them force, that occa&s;ions our hearing of &s;o many grievances, contentions, and in|juries.</P>
<P>THAT the good laws of the land may be duly regard|ed, magi&s;trates &s;hould be revered and honoured. As they are ve&s;ted with the power, they &s;hould be con|&s;idered as po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of the dignity and maje&s;ty of the State. But, by refu&s;ing them due honour, the people di&s;honour them&s;elves, and contribute to bring the community into contempt.</P>
<P>COMPLAINERS and fault-finders, who vent their gallagain&s;t publick characters and mea&s;ures, &s;hould al|ways be di&s;countenanced by every friend to the Re|publick. For per&s;ons &s;hould not be ha&s;ty in con|cluding that their rulers, have erred in any in&s;tance. They &s;hould rather con&s;ider that the collected wi&s;dom of the State or Nation, and the &s;uperior advantages for information, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by political a&s;&s;emblies, ren|der it probable that their deci&s;ions are more wi&s;e and &s;it than the opinions even of an enlightened individ|ual. But, as all men are liable to err, if our rulers are found to do &s;o, none but peaceable and re&s;pectful methods &s;hould be u&s;ed to convince them. As an ec|cle&s;ia&s;tical elder &s;hould be entreated as a parent; &s;o &s;hould our political fathers.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="026855_0028_0FD2397143795010">DISAFFECTION to government often ari&s;es from a &s;ordidly avaricious temper; which makes men back|ward to pay tribute, according to their ability and the exigencies of the State. How unrea&s;onable and &s;hameful are &s;uch a temper and conduct! Is it fit that we &s;hould expect to receive for nothing the un&s;peak|able benefits of good government, the &s;ecurity of our liberties, per&s;ons and fortunes? Can we wi&s;h our rul|ers to &s;pend their time and attention in the publick &s;ervice, without an adequ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">te reward? Or can we be ready to indulge &s;u&s;picions that they are too forward to lay burdens upon us, when we know that they them&s;elves bear their proportion of them, according to their &s;everal abilities? For &s;o happy is our &s;ituation &s;ince the revolution, that our rulers, in mo&s;t ca&s;es, cannot oppre&s;s us without hurting them&s;elves.</P>
<P>LET us &s;ee that we always make the wi&s;e&s;t po&s;&s;ible u&s;e of the power of appointing our own rulers, which the good providence of God has given us; implor|ing his direction in the&s;e matters; and endeavour in all po&s;&s;ible ways to advance the publick welfare. For by &s;o doing we &s;hould remember that we promote our own happine&s;s. All the members partake of the health of the body, political, as well as natural. And that we may not fail of being good &s;ubjects, it &s;hould be con&s;idered that we ought to obey our rulers from a principle of duty to our Almighty Sovereign. For good rulers are ordained by him; and by re&s;i&s;ting them we &s;hall oppo&s;e the ordinance of God, and ex|po&s;e
<PB N="30" REF="026855_0029_0FD2395C9F9E7B80">
our&s;elves to his wrath. It is therefore our duty, our intere&s;t, and wi&s;dom, to re&s;olve that we will &s;ub|mit to their laws, that &s;o we may <HI>lead quiet and peacea|ble lives,</HI> while we per&s;evere <HI>in all godline&s;s and hone&s;|ty: For this is good, and acceptable in the &s;ight of God our Saviour.</HI></P>
<P>NOTHING indeed can do more towards the &s;upport of government, than the practice of religion and vir|tue. Were mankind perfect in the&s;e things, human government and laws would be rendered u&s;ele&s;s. So that the more they are practi&s;ed, the more ea&s;ily gov|ernment will be admini&s;tered; and the more happy will be the condition of &s;ociety. Let us then re&s;olve, that, by the help of God, we will thus become ben|efactors to the publick. If this were done by the generality, a ble&s;&s;ed reformation would be effected. The ble&s;&s;ing of heaven would be upon us, and bet|ter times would be experienced than have ever yet been known. Expen&s;ive vices would give place to fruitful indu&s;try. Rulers and ruled, teachers and private Chri&s;tians, and all corporations in&s;tituted to &s;erve the community, would exert them&s;elves to in|crea&s;e the public happine&s;s. The arts and &s;ciences would flouri&s;h, as genius and learning would be en|couraged. Agriculture and commerce would be more productive of &s;upport and wealth. Manufac|tures would increa&s;e, and arrive to the greate&s;t per|fection. The fame of our increa&s;ing wealth and hap|pine&s;s would draw multitudes of emigrants from oth|er
<PB N="31" REF="026855_0030_0FD2395CCA3BB0A0">
quarters of the globe, to a&s;&s;i&s;t in our improvements, and to participate in our pro&s;perity. Our peace and happine&s;s would exhibit no faint picture of the pre|dicted millennial &s;tate, or be the dawn and introduc|tion of it.</P>
<P>FINALLY. May per&s;ons of all denominations be induced, from evangelical motives, to the religious acknowledgment of the Deity, and the practice of univer&s;al holine&s;s. Thus, being guided by divine coun&s;el, &s;hall we &s;ecure to our&s;elves his approbation and acceptance, through the Redeemer; which are of infinitely greater con&s;equence to us, than all our terre&s;trial enjoyments. The fa&s;hion of this world is &s;wiftly pa&s;&s;ing away. All human governments will &s;oon be terminated, and gone forever. The rapid wheels of time are driving us on to our mo&s;t impor|tant &s;tate of exi&s;tence; in which all the godly and virtuous &s;hall live in greater felicity than it is po&s;&s;ible at pre&s;ent for us to conceive; a happine&s;s an&s;wera|ble to the de&s;ires and capacities of our &s;ouls, without alloy, and without end.</P>
