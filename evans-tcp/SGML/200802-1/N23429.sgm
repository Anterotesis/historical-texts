<HEAD>CHAPTER I.</HEAD>
<P>ABOUT a mile from a pretty town in Hamp&s;hire, lived Mrs. Ley&s;ter, a widow, and &s;till a young woman, with her only daughter Con&s;tantia, who was at the time the&s;e anecdotes begin near eleven years of age. The hou&s;e in which they lived was a &s;mall white building, with a lawn before, parted from harve&s;t fields by a &s;unk fence, and commanding a fine extent of coun|try. Behind the hou&s;e, and on the north &s;ide, was a little &s;hrubbery &s;urrounded
<PB N="6" REF="031014_0006_0FEA5082D98CB1F8">by a green wire fence, and on the &s;outh &s;ide the walled kitchen garden; &s;o that the hou&s;e being open only to the we&s;t, was &s;heltered from the cold winds, and con&s;equently extremely warm and com|fortable. A &s;mall village was &s;ituated at a very &s;hort di&s;tance from this plea&s;|ant re&s;idence; it was entirely occupied by indu&s;trious poor, who always found a friend in time of nece&s;&s;ity at Fair-Lawn, for &s;o Mrs. Ley&s;ter's hou&s;e was called. Con&s;tantia was, as the follow|ing pages will prove, a little girl of an amiable di&s;po&s;ition; &s;he had very good &s;en&s;e, an even temper, and a kind affec|tionate heart, &s;o that &s;he repaid, as far as po&s;&s;ible, the unremitting care and atten|tion of her mother. I &s;ay as far as po&s;|&s;ible, becau&s;e it is only by a whole life of duty and virtue that a child can repay a tender mother the debt which it begins
<PB N="7" REF="031014_0007_0FEA505F50BB10D8">to incur at the moment of its birth. The anxiety which fills the heart of a mother while a child is in the &s;tate of infancy, her watchful nights, her days of fear and caution, a child cannot even imagine; and when this infant &s;o anx|iou&s;ly guarded becomes older, do the mother's cares le&s;&s;en? on the contrary, they increa&s;e, the heedle&s;&s;ne&s;s of youth continually awakens them, a blow, a fall, an accident of any kind gives to the heart of a mother an exqui&s;ite pang. But ah! if &s;he &s;ees, or believes &s;he &s;ees the lea&s;t tendency towards peevi&s;hne&s;s, want of feeling or ob&s;tinacy, then in|deed her unea&s;ine&s;s becomes in&s;upporta|ble; &s;he imagines all her cares are u&s;e|le&s;s, and the only hope of her life de|parting from her. Pardon this digre&s;|&s;ion, my young friends, in con&s;ideration of its con&s;equence, and think as you
<PB N="8" REF="031014_0008_0FEA506FDEB38328">read it how carefully you ought to avoid, as much as po&s;&s;ible, giving pain to the hearts of your parents. Con&s;tantia in|deed knew not the extent of her obli|gations to her mother, but &s;he knew enough to convince her that &s;he could never repay them; &s;he &s;tudied therefore in every thing to be mild, tractable and and obliging; &s;he gave all her attention to tho&s;e le&s;&s;ons her mother wi&s;hed her to learn, and in general was &s;ucce&s;&s;|ful. Mrs. Ley&s;ter taught her to read, work and write, and al&s;o the fir&s;t princi|ples of drawing: a dancing ma&s;ter came twice, and a French ma&s;ter three times a week to give her le&s;&s;ons. Mu&s;ic made no part of her plan, for as Con&s;tantia's fortune would not be large, Mrs. Ley&s;|ter con&s;idered an accompli&s;hment which requires &s;o much time an unnece&s;&s;ary one. Con&s;tantia however had a &s;weet
<PB N="9" REF="031014_0009_0FEA50AC39602410">delicate voice, and a good ear, and Mrs. Ley&s;ter, who had con&s;iderable knowl|edge of mu&s;ic, took plea&s;ure in direct|ing both, &s;o that before Con&s;tantia was ten years old, &s;he could &s;ing &s;everal &s;ongs prettily and agreeably. In the&s;e plea&s;ing and various amu&s;ements the days pa&s;&s;ed on, when one morning in the winter, which completed Con&s;tantia's eleventh year, after a heavy fall of &s;now which remained the depth of &s;ome feet on the ground the &s;un &s;hone out very bright, and the fro&s;t was &s;o hard that Mrs. Ley&s;ter imagined a walk in the &s;hrubbery might not be unplea&s;ant. The trees hanging over had prevented the &s;now from covering the walks, and Con&s;tantia, who had been confined &s;ome days by the weather, gladly pre|pared to accompany her mother. She ran &s;ometimes before her, &s;ometimes in
<PB N="10" REF="031014_0010_0FEA4FF437D8D448">another walk, with all the joy of a young bird who has ju&s;t learned the u&s;e of his wings; while Mrs. Ley&s;ter walked quickly on to keep her&s;elf warm, and admired the beautiful winter piece which met her view, the &s;now &s;parkling in the &s;un, the long icicles which hung from the trees, the branches covered with fro&s;t work, were all agreeable to her eyes. Con&s;tantia at la&s;t came running to her mother, and taking her by the hand, &s;aid, "Now, mama, I will walk with you."</P>

<P>No, my dear, although &s;he is but thirteen, &s;he has been introduced by a mi&s;taken indulgence into company; &s;he has acquired a reli&s;h for di&s;&s;ipation, and lo&s;t that de&s;ire which young people naturally have for the charms and liber|ty of the country. But my dear Con|&s;tantia, I think we &s;hall be able to go under the hedges to the village; 'tis &s;ome time &s;ince we &s;aw the poor people, and perhaps in this &s;evere weather they may want &s;omething.</P>

<P>Yes, indeed&mdash;I want &s;adly to know how poor Dame Burden's rheumati&s;m is&mdash;I am afraid the cold will make her wor&s;e.

The dog then jumped up and again whined, then ran a little way forward, then &s;tood &s;till looking at them, and again whin|ed, "What does this mean," &s;aid Mrs. Ley&s;ter, "this dog &s;eems to implore our a&s;&s;i&s;tance; they are very &s;agacious, let

Con&s;tantia quitting her mother's hand now ran lightly on, while Mrs. Ley&s;ter followed, as fa&s;t as the &s;now and her agitation would let her; but before &s;he had turned the corner of the hedge, Con&s;tantia out of breath, with her cheeks the colour of crim&s;on, ran back exclaiming&mdash;"mama, mama!&mdash;Make ha&s;te, Oh, make ha&s;te, a woman! a poor little infant!"</P>

Her gratitude to Mrs. Ley&s;ter and all her family was unbounded and inexpre&s;&s;ible; &s;he could only &s;hed tears, utter broken &s;entences, and pre&s;s her child to her bo&s;om, while &s;he lifted up her eyes to Heaven in thankfulne&s;s for

<P>A few days after this, Mrs. Ley&s;ter accepted an invitation to dine with a lady at the town which was a|bout a mile from her hou&s;e: &s;he was de&s;ired to bring Con&s;tantia with her, as the lady had a daughter about a year younger than &s;he was. They arrived at Mrs. Selwyn's about half an hour before dinner time, but Maria Selwyn did not come in till ju&s;t as they were &s;etting down to dinner. Scarcely were they &s;eated, when &s;he &s;aid, "mama, I want a piece of pudden." "Hu&s;h," &s;aid Mrs. Selwyn, "wait till every body
<PB N="39" REF="031014_0039_0FEA5012F4A02718">el&s;e is helped, if you plea&s;e!" "Oh, but mama," &s;aid Maria, "I like to eat my pudding before my meat, and I chu&s;e to have it now."&mdash;"Well then," &s;aid Mr. Selwyn, "a&s;k your papa to to cut it for you"&mdash;"Yes, my dear," &s;aid Mrs. Selwyn, "I will cut it for you directly"&mdash;which he did, to the great &s;urprize of Con&s;tantia, who was quite unaccu&s;tomed to &s;ee a little girl behave &s;o rudely. Maria Selwyn, however, always did behave &s;o; &s;he was quite a &s;poiled child, and &s;uffered to do ju&s;t as &s;he liked; &s;o &s;he eat enough for two little girls, and of the mo&s;t improper things, a&s;king for every thing &s;he wi&s;hed to have, eating extremely fa&s;t, and even putting her knife into the tarts to take out &s;ome of the fruit; &s;he al&s;o put her knife into her mouth in&s;tead of eating with her fork or &s;poon, and &s;he had &s;o
<PB N="40" REF="031014_0040_0FEA50106F733398">many untidy tricks at table, that a very delicate per&s;on would have been made &s;ick by her, and every body mu&s;t be di&s;|gu&s;ted: &s;he held her knife and fork &s;o low, that her hand came upon part of the blade: in &s;hort, &s;he was more awk|ward, and behaved wor&s;e than any child of five years old, who has been u&s;ed to eat with decent people. Mrs. Selwyn, indeed, &s;ometimes checked her with, "don't, Maria, upon my word I will &s;end you from table;" but as this threat was never put in execution, it was per|fectly di&s;regarded, and Mi&s;s Maria continued to di&s;tre&s;s every body by her impertinence and voraciou&s;ne&s;s. After dinner, when the fruit was &s;et upon the table, any one would have &s;uppo&s;ed, that &s;o far from having eaten an amazing dinner, Mi&s;s Maria had not had any, for &s;he devoured apples, pears and nuts,
<PB N="41" REF="031014_0041_0FEA50B8E73070B0">together with almonds, rai&s;ins and oranges, &s;o as perfectly to a&s;toni&s;h the moderate and &s;imple Con&s;tantia. Mrs. Selwyn earne&s;tly pre&s;&s;ed Mi&s;s I cy&s;ter to take more fruit than &s;he &s;eemed inclined to do, and turning to Mrs. Ley&s;ter, &s;aid, "I am &s;ure you will let Mi&s;s Con&s;tan|tia eat another orange"&mdash;"She is at liberty to do ju&s;t as &s;he plea&s;es," replied Mrs. Ley&s;ter; "I have entirely cea&s;ed to re&s;train her in point of eating for this twelve month." Mrs. Selwyn then again begged Con&s;tantia to eat another orange, but &s;he declined it. When the table was cleared, Mi&s;s Selwyn &s;at very quiet|ly and &s;eemingly half a&s;leep in her place, till Mrs. Selwyn told her to take Mi&s;s Ley&s;ter into her dre&s;&s;ing-room, "which," added &s;he, "you have &s;trew|ed from one end to the other with your playthings, and even with your &s;quir|rel's
<PB N="42" REF="031014_0042_0FEA5091166FBA88">cage, though I always tell you I will not have him in my apartment!" "But, mama," &s;aid Mi&s;s Selwyn, "may we not have Ro&s;e to play with us?"&mdash; "Yes" an&s;wered her mother, "if you will behave better to her than you gener|ally do. I dare &s;ay Mi&s;s Ley&s;ter would be a&s;hamed to &s;ee you u&s;e her &s;o ill! Ah, I wi&s;h you would take pattern by <HI>her</HI>!" The two children then went away, and Mi&s;s Selwyn led her vi&s;itor into her mother's dre&s;&s;ing-room, which was indeed, as &s;he had &s;aid, &s;trewed from one end to the other with play-things; &s;ome whole, &s;ome broken, and &s;o various as to afford great amu&s;ement to Con&s;tan|tia, who was u&s;ed to have but few. There were no le&s;s than five dolls, tumb|lers, children flying a kite, hor&s;es and hounds, a large box with a very pretty &s;how, a magic lanthorn, and a book of

Con&s;tantia very eagerly looked over this exten&s;ive collection, but finding the variety di&s;tracted her at|tention, &s;o that &s;he could examine noth|ing, &s;he left every thing but the &s;hew, which amu&s;ed her very agreeably for &s;ome time; in the mean while Mi&s;s Sel|wyn was talking to her about the things, but at la&s;t, finding her &s;o much plea&s;ed with the &s;hew, &s;aid, "dear, what do you like that ugly thing!"</P>

<P>As to the poor little girl who waits on her, &s;he is indeed, much to be pitied; &s;he is truly a &s;lave to this little feeble tyrant, who is &s;uffered to torment her, without being taught that &s;he is in reality inferior to the poor girl. Children are really totally dependent on others; if
<PB N="60" REF="031014_0060_0FEA4FE3A505C0B0">&s;ervants did not help them they would be mi&s;erably &s;ituated; it is true &s;ervants are paid for what they do, but children do not pay them, and they are therefore doubly obliged to the kind parent who accommodates them with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance they want and cannot do without.

<PB N="64" REF="031014_0064_0FEA4FD2CB0E2F58">one mean of giving her plea&s;ure, and the con&s;equence is, &s;he &s;poils her appear|ance, making her per&s;on large, heavy, and dull, and what is wor&s;e, &s;he injures her health, and of cour&s;e clogs the ac|tivity of her mind.</P>

<P>Alas! yes, my dear; and unhappily, not only children fall into this delu&s;ion. Many people, who&s;e age and good &s;en&s;e ought to teach them better, will per&s;i&s;t in eating &s;uch things as di&s;agree with them, or too much of tho&s;e which are proper. As nothing is more degrading than the latter, which reduces human

<P>My dear child, there is certainly noth|ing
<PB N="66" REF="031014_0066_0FEA50E0FA89EA88">&s;o tender as the love of a fond mother. It is hard to deny any thing to a child, which &s;eems at the time likely to give it plea&s;ure; but in a mind regu|lated by <HI>principle,</HI> this pa&s;&s;ionate fond|ne&s;s is repre&s;&s;ed by the con&s;ideration, that in the end it will render its object unhappy. A good mother is not <HI>&s;elfi&s;h</HI> enough to endulge her own <HI>feelings</HI> by indulging her child, when &s;he knows, as a per&s;on accu&s;tomed to rea&s;on mu&s;t know, that a child always indulged is re|ally not &s;o happy as one under proper controul, and that the con&s;equences of unlimited indulgence when this child grows up, will be frightful.

<SPEAKER>MRS. LEYSTER.</SPEAKER>
<P>My dear, you are not the fir&s;t who has been mi&s;taken in this matter. Many people have in like manner, adopted a child, taken it out of the &s;tation in which Providence had placed it; refined its &s;en|timents, taught it various accompli&s;h|ments, and then, either by accident or neglect, have at their death left it to &s;truggle with a world with which it was unfit to contend. Luxury and refined ideas have already too much pervaded the lower as well as higher cla&s;&s;es of people. The notion of equality is an
<PB N="76" REF="031014_0076_0FEA50FD2AC6CA58">ab&s;urd, an unnatural notion. The ne|ce&s;&s;ities of man are never &s;o well ob|viated, as in &s;ocieties where di&s;tinctions of rank and degree are pre&s;erved. Are the &s;avage tribes, where every man hunts, cooks and builds for him&s;elf, &s;o happy as tho&s;e nations where every man has his di&s;tinct occupation? God has made a difference in his gifts, both bodily and mental, to different men; and un|doubtedly God has always intended a difference in degree, which the&s;e gifts will always pre&s;erve. For in&s;tance, if five men were in an equal &s;ituation placed on a de&s;art &s;hore, the wi&s;e&s;t would &s;oon become governor, the mo&s;t cour|ageous would be their guard, their &s;old|ier; the &s;tronge&s;t would be their wood|cutter, their builder; the mo&s;t agile would provide their food; the mo&s;t in|genious (for I di&s;tingui&s;h between in|genuity
<PB N="77" REF="031014_0077_0FEA510ADF5BBD90">and wi&s;dom) would be their mechanic. But Con&s;tance, I hardly know if you will under&s;tand all this &s;pec|ulation; I get a habit of talking to you on all &s;ubjects, hardly con&s;idering whe|ther or not they are intere&s;ting to you, and this, from &s;ome ridiculous opinions I have lately heard, has been much upon my mind. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is to be ob&s;erved, Mrs. Ley&s;ter is &s;peak|ing &s;oon after the beginning of the French rev|olution.</NOTE></P>

<P>For common &s;ervants, in my opinion it is quite &s;ufficient if they are taught their duty to God and man, and to read it in the Holy Scriptures. For them; e&s;pecially for women &s;ervants, <HI>I</HI> di&s;ap|prove of learning to write. <HI>My</HI> expe|rience has hitherto taught me, that tho&s;e who are in&s;tructed in that branch of learning, more frequently become idle &s;cribblers, prying and curious into the affairs of others, than u&s;eful and active &s;ervants. I &s;peak with diffidence, how|ever, for many wi&s;e and good people have thought otherwi&s;e. However, as Jenny will never, I hope, be reduced to the condition of a lower &s;ervant, I will allow you to teach her to read and &s;pell well, to write, and the three fir&s;t rules in arithmetic; plain work of every &s;ort,
<PB N="79" REF="031014_0079_0FEA506E4A360380">but no curious works. And &s;he &s;hall be in&s;tructed by Martha in confectionary and pa&s;try.

Activity, and the power of providing for her&s;elf, are great virtues in hers, and indeed in <HI>every</HI> &s;tation. And very early, I doubt not, my dear Con&s;tance, you will teach her the con&s;tant u&s;e of prayer and the fir&s;t principles of religion.

But not to dwell on &s;o &s;ad an idea, I mu&s;t de|clare, that I will not at any time &s;uffer the child to be dre&s;&s;ed with any degree of <HI>finery,</HI> no ribbons, no ornaments of any kind; her dre&s;s &s;hall be neat and clean, but no more; I will never have her taught to forget her origin, or be a&s;hamed of the lowly garb of her mother.</P>
</SP>
<P>Here the conver&s;ation ended, and omitting many trifling occurrences, I &s;hall let a year pa&s;s in which nothing very material happened. Con&s;tantia grew and improved: Little Jenny was to her a con&s;tant &s;ource of amu&s;ement and em|ployment. She could now talk, and Con|&s;tantia waited impatiently the end of another year, at which time &s;he hoped to begin teaching her to read. Mary Thom&s;on was placed in the hou&s;e Mrs.
<PB N="82" REF="031014_0082_0FEA4FF2AECD4ED8">Ley&s;ter had promi&s;ed her, and &s;ucceeded extremely well. The &s;pring was now beginning to appear, and Con&s;tantia &s;pent much of her time in her little gar|den. Her flowers were finer than u&s;ual; &s;he looked forward to their blooming, and drew from air and exerci&s;e a fine healthy bloom, which proved the goodne&s;s of her con&s;titution. She was now be|tween twelve and thirteen, tall and well made, with a face not indeed beautiful, but extremely plea&s;ing, becau&s;e it &s;poke &s;weetne&s;s of temper, good &s;en&s;e, and an affectionate feeling heart; nor was her appearance deceitful, for &s;he really po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed all the&s;e amiable qualities.</P>
<P>One morning the footman brought Mrs. Ley&s;ter a letter; &s;he opened it, &s;aying, "from my &s;i&s;ter!" while Con|&s;tance went on with her work. "Ble&s;s

<HEAD>TO MRS. LEYSTER.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY DEAR SISTER,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE &s;y&s;tem of education; again&s;t which you have &s;o often argued, I at la&s;t find to be erroneous. Alicia has deceived my expectations. She has been imprudent, di&s;ingenuous, and unfaithful to her promi&s;e. The&s;e are har&s;h expre&s;|&s;ions, and if I did not hope the error aro&s;e rather from habit and want of thought than from her heart, I &s;hould be this day a mi&s;erable creature; as it is, I am truly unhappy. Le&s;t you &s;hould be too much alarmed, I will make ha&s;te to di&s;clo&s;e the nature of the evil I lament. When Alicia was thirteen, I con&s;ented, at her reque&s;t, to make her a yearly al|lowance for clothes and pocket money,
<PB N="86" REF="031014_0086_0FEA50FA51FECFC0">upon promi&s;e that &s;he &s;hould never at any time purcha&s;e any thing without im|mediate payment. My allowance rather exceeded what had been before expended for her clothes, becau&s;e I knew it was in vain to expect exact economy from &s;uch a girl. For the fir&s;t quarter &s;he bought many expen&s;ive trifles, and was in want of many nece&s;&s;ary articles, &s;uch as gloves, &s;hoes, threads, &amp;c. I remarked to her this folly, and hoped in the &s;econd quarter &s;he had corrected it. Here I allow I was my&s;elf guilty of a very great error: I ought to have made her &s;et down every thing &s;he purcha&s;ed, and have my&s;elf examined her accounts; but this, depending on her promi&s;e not to run in debt, I neglected to do. For this la&s;t quarter I have ob&s;erved her frequently dejected, almo&s;t always grave, and was in pain for her health. About
<PB N="87" REF="031014_0087_0FEA507F51386AB0">a month after I had paid her her la&s;t quarter, not having quite ca&s;h enough in my pur&s;e to pay a bill, I reque&s;ted her to lend me two guineas. I knew it was not a month &s;ince I had paid her four, and as I had not ob&s;erved &s;he had bought any thing, I concluded &s;he had almo&s;t the whole by her: &s;he blu&s;hed exce&s;&s;ively, and after &s;ome he&s;itation, &s;aid, &s;he had but one guinea left. "What," &s;aid I; "three guineas in a month! and what are you to do till your quarter is again due?" "Oh, I &s;hall not want to buy any thing." "But," &s;aid I, "what have you done with it, you have nothing that I know of?" She &s;till looked exce&s;&s;ively red and confu&s;ed, and I determined to di&s;cover what all this meant. I will not tire you with particulars, but tell you at once; &s;he had been lead by the example of the
<PB N="88" REF="031014_0088_0FEA50D2F0E424D0">Mi&s;s Seymours, who are always in debt, and ridiculed her &s;cruples, to run in debt more than &s;he had even yet paid to her milliner, &s;hoemaker and mantua|maker. I repre&s;ented to her the folly and impropriety of her conduct; &s;he &s;aid it had made her exce&s;&s;ively unea&s;y, and after much conver&s;ation, I agreed to di&s;charge her debts, which &s;till a|mounted to &s;ome guineas, on two con|ditions; one, that &s;he &s;hould give up half her allowance for the next year, and to break her intimacy with the&s;e idle girls, that &s;he &s;hould go into the country for at lea&s;t half a year. And now, my dear &s;i&s;ter, will you exert that affection which I know you feel for me, and take upon your&s;elf for a few months the care of this mi&s;taken girl. If you will, I &s;hall feel my&s;elf for ever obliged to you,

<P>Mrs. Ley&s;ter, however unwilling to be charged with a young per&s;on who&s;e education had been &s;o neglected, yet could not refu&s;e a &s;i&s;ter, whom, how|ever different from her&s;elf, &s;he &s;incerely loved. She wrote, therefore, a letter of con&s;ent, and Con&s;tantia one of invitation to her cou&s;in. Con&s;tantia, &s;hocked and &s;urpri&s;ed as &s;he was, yet made every ex|cu&s;e for her cou&s;in, candor and good-nature could &s;ugge&s;t, and impatiently waited her arrival; not becau&s;e &s;he ex|pected any great addition to her own happine&s;s from it, for her cou&s;in, &s;he was aware, loved pur&s;uits far different from her own, but becau&s;e &s;he wi&s;hed to &s;ooth, by every kind attention, the

<P>IN about a week's time Alicia ar|rived. She was in her per&s;on a fine &s;hewy girl, in her dre&s;s and air fa&s;hion|able, but her countenance wanted that &s;oftne&s;s, tho&s;e &s;miles and blu&s;hes which adorned Con&s;tantia's expre&s;&s;ive face, and her manner that retiring mildne&s;s which Con&s;tantia's exhibited. Con&s;tantia flew to welcome her, but her &s;alute was coldly, even haughtily returned, and to the graver look of Mrs. Ley&s;ter an air of &s;ullen pride was oppo&s;ed. Alicia &s;eemed to feel her&s;elf aggrieved
<PB N="92" REF="031014_0092_0FEA5117DBE5FF90">by the obligation to vi&s;it tho&s;e &s;he im|agined beneath her, to be determined not to find amu&s;ement in any thing they could offer her, and to think her fault much too &s;everely puni&s;hed by the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of a re&s;idence &s;o unplea&s;ant. Not a word was &s;poken of the cau&s;e of her vi&s;it, and Con&s;tantia recovering her &s;pir|its, which Alicia's coldne&s;s had damped, anxiou&s;ly tried to amu&s;e her.

<P>Con&s;tantia, perceiving their opinions were &s;o different that an argument would be endle&s;s, again propo&s;ed a walk in the garden, which, with a &s;ort of indolent indifference Alicia agreed to; but this walk afforded neither any plea&s;ure;
<PB N="95" REF="031014_0095_0FEA50E5E3027A88">Con&s;tantia vainly pointed out beauties, of which Alicia had no idea.

<P>Alicia did not very well know what to &s;ay to this &s;peech; &s;he therefore only with a peevi&s;h kind of &s;hudder, remarked that it was cold, and de&s;ired to return to the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>The next morning the woman &s;ervant who had accompanied Mi&s;s Woodford from London was to return. She came into the parlour to take a letter from Mrs. Ley&s;ter, and then a&s;ked of Mi&s;s Woodford what me&s;&s;age &s;he &s;hould carry from her to her mi&s;tre&s;s; but Alicia, di&s;tre&s;&s;ed and unhappy, could not an|&s;wer; the tears which &s;tood in her eyes, her trembling lips and fading colour
<PB N="98" REF="031014_0098_0FEA501C8FA1D0D8">&s;hewed her unea&s;ine&s;s. Mrs. Ley&s;ter and Con&s;tantia retired to the window, that &s;he might &s;peak without re&s;traint; but &s;uddenly exclaiming; "Say; I will write &s;oon," &s;he ran out of the room. Con&s;tantia much affected re|mained below &s;ome minutes, and in the mean time Mrs. Woodford's &s;er|vant got into the carriage and drove away. Con&s;tantia then followed her cou&s;in; &s;he found her at the window of her room, looking after the car|riage in tears. "Ah!" &s;he exclaimed, before Con&s;tance could approach her, "&s;he will again &s;ee London and my dear mother! and I am left in this horrid place! Good God! was it <HI>my</HI> fault!" She &s;topped, hearing Con&s;tantia's &s;tep, and with an angry tone, &s;aid, "Have I not even the priv|ilege of being alone? I am not u&s;ed,
<PB N="99" REF="031014_0099_0FEA50EFA02C1580">Mi&s;s Ley&s;ter, to be thus intruded upon! Ah, I am indeed very little u&s;ed to any thing I can expect to meet with <HI>here</HI>!" Con&s;tantia, who had been half terrified by her fir&s;t addre&s;s, now &s;eeing her in an agony of grief, approached, and cla&s;ping her in her arms &s;aid, "My deare&s;t cou&s;in, I beg you to pardon me if I am an intruder; I came to &s;ee if I could do any thing to comfort you, but if you wi&s;h me gone I will leave you. But why &s;hould you wi&s;h it? Suffer me to be your friend; &s;uffer me, if po&s;&s;ible, to make you hap|py!" Alicia, &s;oftened by her tend|erne&s;s, now felt the coldne&s;s, the con|tempt with which &s;he had hitherto re|garded her was melting fa&s;t from about her heart; &s;he returned Con&s;tantia's embrace, and &s;hed tears of affection and gratitude on her bo&s;om. For &s;ome time
<PB N="100" REF="031014_0100_0FEA5267F3FA0BA8">neither could &s;peak, but at la&s;t Alicia &s;aid, "you are very good; better than I either expected or de&s;erved. You know I have much to lament; leave me, pray, my dear, I will &s;oon come down." Con&s;tantia in&s;tantly left her. In about an hour Alicia came down &s;tairs, her manner in a great mea&s;ure changed. To her aunt &s;he was more re&s;pectful and le&s;s cold, and to Con&s;tance more affectionate. Still &s;he treated her as a child, and as being much inferior to her&s;elf; &s;he &s;till &s;eem|ed to &s;uppo&s;e it impo&s;&s;ible that a girl educated in the country could have any accompli&s;hments, or be enabled to form a proper judgment on any &s;ubject. To read, except the light publications of the hour, &s;he had never been accu&s;|tomed. Needle-work, and mo&s;t of the little ingenious re&s;ources of women in
<PB N="101" REF="031014_0101_0FEA533C6DF90330">general, &s;he de&s;pi&s;ed as beneath her at|tention. The fifth morning after her ar|rival Con&s;tantia's drawing ma&s;ter came. Her port-folio and implements were in|&s;tantly produced. "Ble&s;s me, Mi&s;s Ley&s;ter," &s;aid Alicia, "do you draw?" "A little," replied Con&s;tance, "but I am very fond of it." "So am I," &s;aid Alicia, "though I have not practi&s;ed lately; if you will give me a pencil I will try." "Oh, willingly," &s;aid Con|&s;tance, well plea&s;ed that &s;he could find any amu&s;ement. They then &s;at down. Con&s;tantia's ma&s;ter gave her a &s;ubject, and while &s;he began the de&s;ign, amu&s;ed him&s;elf with making &s;ketches. Alicia began a bunch of flowers, and all was &s;ilent. In about half an hour Con&s;tance a&s;ked her ma&s;ter &s;ome que&s;tion, and Alicia, ca&s;ting her eyes on Con&s;tantia's drawing, exclaimed, "Ble&s;s me, Con|&s;tantia,
<PB N="102" REF="031014_0102_0FEA533A1C40D578">do <HI>you</HI> de&s;ign <HI>figures</HI>?" "Yes," an&s;wered Con&s;tantia, "why are you &s;o &s;urpri&s;ed?" Oh, becau&s;e, becau&s;e, you &s;aid you drew but a little." "Mi&s;s Ley&s;ter, is very mode&s;t, Ma'am," &s;aid the drawing ma&s;ter, "but the fact is, I have very little more to teach her. Very well done, indeed; pray Ma'am look at this figure, it is Lavinia from Thom|&s;on's Sea&s;ons; is not the drapery well done?" "Yes, very well," &s;aid Alicia coolly; then ri&s;ing, &s;he tore her own performance in two and threw it into the grate. "Dear cou&s;in," &s;aid Con|&s;tantia, "are you tired, why have you torn your drawing?" "Becau&s;e I was not plea&s;ed with it," &s;aid Alicia grave|ly. The drawing time was &s;oon ex|pired; Con&s;tantia's performance was greatly advanced, and &s;he was to fini&s;h it before her ma&s;ter came again. When
<PB N="103" REF="031014_0103_0FEA5328F8CFC320">he was gone, Mrs. Ley&s;ter commended the drawing, and told Con&s;tance &s;he had given her great plea&s;ure by her ap|plication. "Ah, mama," &s;aid Con|&s;tance, "I have no merit in applying to drawing, becau&s;e I love it &s;o much, but if it were di&s;agreeable to me, I &s;hould be over-paid by your being plea&s;ed. In the cour&s;e of this day Alicia, who fancied her cou&s;in could know nothing becau&s;e &s;he had been brought up in the country, had the far|ther mortification of finding &s;he knew French much better than her&s;elf, that &s;he had &s;ome knowledge of Italian, and that &s;he danced va&s;tly well. Her conver&s;ations al&s;o with her mother proved her &s;o well acquainted with all books proper for her age, and to po&s;|&s;e&s;s &s;o much knowledge in geography, natural hi&s;tory, and the hi&s;tory of her
<PB N="104" REF="031014_0104_0FEA526A5E6887D8">own country, be&s;ides a thou&s;and little ingenious works, and that young as &s;he was, &s;he a&s;&s;i&s;ted a great deal in the family management, that Alicia began to take &s;hame to her&s;elf for her. Thus they pa&s;&s;ed a fortnight, and every day added to Alicia's concealed ad|miration of her cou&s;in; when &s;he &s;aw how readily Con&s;tance employed tho&s;e hours which <HI>&s;he</HI> found &s;o heavy, how happy &s;he was and how agreeable, &s;he began to wi&s;h her&s;elf like her. In look|ing over &s;ome books &s;he found the Tales of the Ca&s;tle in French, which Con|&s;tance warmly recommended to her peru&s;al. She took the fir&s;t volume, becau&s;e &s;he knew not what to do. The &s;tory of Delphine, arre&s;ted her at|tention; her heart told her there was &s;ome &s;imilarity between her&s;elf and Delphine, and between Henrietta Stein|hau&s;en
<PB N="105" REF="031014_0105_0FEA52568B2370C0">and her cou&s;in; &s;he blu&s;hed as &s;he read, and the tears &s;welled in her eyes. Mrs. Ley&s;ter ob&s;erved but would not interrupt her: in a few minutes &s;he &s;tole out of the room with the book in her hand, and was not vi&s;ible again till dinner time; &s;he then appeared to have been weeping, and her manner was grave and dejected. After dinner they walked out. Alicia, who now began to feel real re&s;pect and af|fection, walked with her arm through hers, Mrs. Ley&s;ter &s;ometimes with them, &s;ometimes at a little di&s;tance gathering mo&s;&s;es and plants which the &s;pring produced; for &s;uch a long re&s;idence in the country had made her a &s;ort of prac|tical botani&s;t. They called on Mrs. Thom&s;on, who received them with grateful re&s;pect, and little Jenny with rapture. She had been confined by a
<PB N="106" REF="031014_0106_0FEA5258119F6210">cold, but was to come the next day to pa&s;s two or three with Con&s;tantia. While Con&s;tance was playing with her, Mrs. Ley&s;ter &s;aid &s;he and Alicia would &s;tep in and &s;peak to Dame Burden; "I will follow you in ten minutes, mama," &s;aid Con&s;tance, and away they went. Dame Burden was a poor old woman, who had been confined many years to her bed with the rheumati&s;m. They found her with every thing about her quite clean, and though in great pain, rejoiced by the vi&s;it. "But where," &s;aid &s;he, "is my dear young lady; I hope &s;he is not ill.

But to enforce what I &s;ay, &s;uffer me to tell you a little &s;tory of which I know the truth. When I was in London, ju&s;t after my marriage, a young friend and my&s;elf were pa&s;&s;ing through a narrow &s;treet in my carriage, when a little boy ran directly under the hor&s;es feet; providentially I &s;aw him time enough, by pulling the check, to &s;ave him from being much hurt. I in&s;tant|ly jumped out, and inquired of two or
<PB N="123" REF="031014_0123_0FEA5210C5A4CF18">three people the accident had drawn to|gether who&s;e child he was; they point|ed out a mean looking hou&s;e, where they &s;aid his parents lived, and my young friend and I went in, followed by the footman carrying the child, who though meanly dre&s;&s;ed was clean and pretty. A young &s;ickly looking woman, who was rocking a cradle with her foot, while her hands were bu&s;ily employed in making a gown, ro&s;e with &s;urpri&s;e to receive us, but &s;he was &s;adly alarmed when &s;he &s;aw the child pale and di&s;or|dered. We &s;oon compo&s;ed her mind, and &s;he thanked us in terms above her &s;tation. I promi&s;ed to call again the next day to inquire after the child, and after &s;lipping a guinea into his little hand we went away. The next day I did not fail to call, and found the child quite re|covered. The young woman's thanks and manner of &s;peaking were mode&s;t and
<PB N="124" REF="031014_0124_0FEA526149FC6968">intere&s;ting; there was an air of cleanly poverty about them, and &s;he &s;eemed &s;ick|ly. I made a few inquiries about her way of life, and as &s;he was communica|tive, I ea&s;ily learned the following partic|ulars. She had been brought up genteel|ly, but was reduced by her father's death to the nece&s;&s;ity of getting her own bread. A relation has apprenticed her to a man|tua-maker, and when her time was out &s;he &s;et up for her&s;elf, and &s;oon obtained &s;ufficient bu&s;ine&s;s to &s;upport her, e&s;pe|cially by the employment of two very young ladies of quality, who&s;e mother at that time &s;uperintended their clothes. She &s;oon after married a young man who was journeyman to a great &s;ilk-mercer, and they went on very well till after the birth of their fir&s;t child; then the&s;e two young ladies I &s;poke of before having obtained an <HI>allowance</HI> from their mother, began not to be &s;o punctual in their
<PB N="125" REF="031014_0125_0FEA53186AB84398">payments. Still Mrs. Martin worked for them. She was frequently ordered to buy linings and trimmings of various &s;orts, for which &s;he paid, but was not paid again. The per&s;on who employ|ed her hu&s;band failed, and went off &s;ome pounds in debt, and as &s;he had now a long bill on her fa&s;hionable cu&s;tomers, &s;he ventured, the next time they ordered &s;omething, to hint &s;he &s;hould be glad of a little money. Promi&s;es were the re|ply, promi&s;es which were never kept. Her affairs began to get deranged, as her hu&s;band was out of employment, and was afflicted with a con&s;umptive com|plaint which prevented his getting any. At this unfortunate time poor Mrs. Martin lay in of her &s;econd child, and her little &s;tock of money was con&s;e|quently all expended. She knew the &s;um her two principal cu&s;tomers owed her would &s;upport them till &s;he could
<PB N="126" REF="031014_0126_0FEA51EC89A55470">get again to work, &s;he ventured therefore to &s;end a note by her hu&s;band to entreat the payment of it. But her hu&s;band re|turned with the &s;ad intelligence that only one &s;ervant was left in the hou&s;e, and the whole family was gone to Spa for a twelvemonth! This was a terri|ble &s;troke! They were &s;lightly indebted to their landlady, and a few other per|&s;ons: the&s;e debts they had no means of di&s;charging but by &s;elling &s;ome of their furniture. The woman with whom they lodged took alarm, and at la&s;t in|formed them that &s;he had let her apart|ments to "people who would not be o|bliged to &s;ell their furniture to pay her!" They were therefore under the nece&s;&s;ity of removing to the poor hou&s;e, where I found then, and where it was too much trouble to &s;ome of her fine cu&s;tomers to come.&mdash; "A mantua-maker in &s;uch a vulgar place!&mdash;They were &s;orry for her,
<PB N="127" REF="031014_0127_0FEA524EFA6A3558">but henceforth they &s;hould employ Ma|dame A&mdash;r, Madamoi&s;elle B&mdash;, who lived in &s;uch a &s;quare or &s;treet!"

<PB N="128" REF="031014_0128_0FEA531BB6358488">&s;hop. I inquired the name of the ladies who had gone away in their debt, and found I had a &s;light acquaintance with their family. I then, after making inquiries which confirmed the truth of their &s;tory, and the good opinion I en|tertained of them, drove to Mr. &mdash; the &s;ilk-mercer's, with whom I had laid out a con&s;iderable &s;um on my marriage. I did not leave him till I had obtained his promi&s;e to employ poor Martin with a comfortable &s;alary. I afterwards wrote in my own name to one of the young la|dies at Spa, and after &s;everely cen&s;uring their unju&s;t conduct, I told them if the money was not remitted within a certain time, I &s;hould write an account of their behavior to their mother. The money was almo&s;t immediately remitted to me, with a civil letter, and many attempts at excu&s;es. With this &s;um I advi&s;ed Mrs. Martin to remove to a genteel part of
<PB N="129" REF="031014_0129_0FEA532458C8D558">the town: I gave her my own cu&s;tom, and recommended her to many others. I had the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing my endea|vors &s;ucceed, and with very little expen&s;e or trouble to my&s;elf, I had the happine&s;s of re&s;cuing the&s;e poor people from mi&s;|ery, and &s;eeing them in a flouri&s;hing way. Poor Martin's health was recov|ered, and they were both till their deaths, which happened &s;oon after each other within the&s;e four years, the mo&s;t grateful, indu&s;trious creatures I ever knew. The boy is now in the &s;ea &s;er|vice, and the girl with a milliner in Bond-&s;treet, and both likely to do well. I &s;ee, my dear Alicia, I need not impre&s;s this &s;trongly on your mind. You feel how unju&s;t mu&s;t be that conduct, which may &s;o ea&s;ily involve a whole family in ruin. Be&s;ides, if this unhappy propen&s;ity to living beyond your income grow up with you, when you are your own mi&s;tre&s;s,
<PB N="130" REF="031014_0130_0FEA5214EB7EFE98">and perhaps have the care of a family, the mi&s;chief will become more extend|ed: inevitable ruin to your&s;elf and your family mu&s;t en&s;ue, for no income can equal the profu&s;ene&s;s of an extravagant, carele&s;s woman.

As &s;he became more acquainted with books, and particularly the poems of Thom&s;on and
<PB N="135" REF="031014_0135_0FEA51FD40450FB0">Cowper,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Thom&s;on's Sea&s;ons and Cowper's Ta&s;k.</NOTE> a thou&s;and natural beauties &s;he had before overlooked, now charmed her eyes and gratified her heart; and learning to be charitable from tho&s;e &s;he was with, &s;he found that to &s;acrifice an expen&s;ive ornament or piece of millinery, by giving the money they would have co&s;t to the poor, gave her more plea&s;|ure than &s;he could have received from wearing them. Her per&s;on improved by exerci&s;e and the new virtues of her mind, her manners acquired a &s;oftne&s;s and mode&s;ty, and in three months time &s;he would &s;carcely have been known. Mrs. Ley&s;ter, however, ob&s;erved, that &s;he had not lo&s;t, and that Con&s;tance had acquired one of Alicia's bad habits; &s;he waited for a proper opportunity to rebuke her for it, and it occurred. They &s;at at work one morning; Con&s;tantia

<P>Yes, Con&s;tantia.&mdash;Without any in|ducement, affected by a moment's &s;ur|pri&s;e, by any thing of no &s;ort of con&s;e|quence, you call eagerly upon that great, that Supreme Being, who&s;e name ought never to be invoked but with &s;en|&s;ations of awe and re&s;pect, who has ex|pre&s;sly forbidden you "to take his name in vain," or even without cau&s;e to &s;wear "by the Heaven which is his throne, or the earth which is his foot&s;tool!"

<P>I hope you never will. Even if it were not extremely wicked, which it is, there is &s;omething &s;o bold, &s;o unfeminine in a woman's u&s;ing &s;uch expre&s;&s;ions, that I never can bear to hear it. My dear Alicia blu&s;hes and looks aba&s;hed. I own my dear, I have ob&s;erved this ill habit in you with great pain, and only waited a favorable moment to tell you of it. Con&s;tantia has learned it of you, you I &s;uppo&s;e learnt it of your London friends. I know too many young women think nothing of &s;uch appeals to the Deity, nor of other improper exclamations. They think, I believe, that it gives them an
<PB N="139" REF="031014_0139_0FEA524712FC07F8">air of fa&s;hion, whereas in reality the low|e&s;t of the people are the greate&s;t offend|ers in this way. The&s;e young ladies alledge that they mean nothing by it; but what then, can they no expre&s;s their &s;urpri&s;e by more decent exclamations, and without breaking an ab&s;olute <HI>com|mandmant</HI>? Some of them, I am afraid, &s;eldom hear the name of God, except when it "is taken in vain." For them I feel extreme pity, for their in&s;tructors, utter indignation. But for religious young women, tho&s;e who know and rev|erence the "Father of all," to u&s;e &s;uch expre&s;&s;ions, is really &s;hocking. And if for every idle word we &s;hall be called to account, as the &s;cripture a&s;&s;ures us, how &s;hall tho&s;e an&s;wer who wantonly and wilfully are perpetually taking the name of "God in vain?" Correct, both of you, I entreat you, this terrible cu&s;|tom,
<PB N="140" REF="031014_0140_0FEA5334F57B6418">and let me never more have occa|&s;ion to reprove you on this &s;ubject.</P>

<P>Lectures like this on many errors Ali|cia frequently received, but delivered with &s;uch &s;weetne&s;s of manner, &s;uch &s;trength of rea&s;oning, &s;he could not be di&s;plea&s;ed with them; they every day became le&s;s and le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary, and by the end of the &s;ix months which &s;he had promi&s;ed to &s;pend in the country, &s;he was every thing that could be wi&s;hed. Mrs. Woodford came at the end of that time to &s;ee her &s;i&s;ter and niece, and to fetch home her daughter; but Alicia, no longer pre&s;uming, con&s;cious of her former deficiencies, and fearful of loo&s;|ing what &s;he had acquired, begged to remain another half year in the country, at the expiration of which Mrs. Ley&s;ter and Con&s;tance promi&s;ed to return with her to London. To this Mrs. Wood|ford
<PB N="141" REF="031014_0141_0FEA526594A7F2D8">readily agreed, and delighted with the improvement of her daughter, and the goodne&s;s of Con&s;tantia, whom &s;he had not &s;een for many years, &s;he &s;taid a month with them and then returned to London. Con&s;tance had now the plea&s;|ure of &s;eeing her little Jenny old enough to profit by her le&s;&s;ons, and the child grew and improved as much as &s;he could de&s;ire. When Alicia returned to London, Mrs. and Mi&s;s Ley&s;ter went with her. They remained &s;ome weeks in town, enjoying in moderation the plea&s;ures it affords. They then went back, leaving the grateful Alicia with her happy moth|er, with whom &s;he &s;till remains, though a frequent interchange of vi&s;its is kept up between the inhabitants of Fair Lawn and Mrs. and Mi&s;s Woodford. The latter is become one of the mo&s;t amiable young women of the age; &s;he and Con&s;tantia are univer&s;ally beloved in
<PB N="142" REF="031014_0142_0FEA533EB0BE4580">the circle of their acquaintance; and both gratefully and con&s;tantly allow, that they owe all their happine&s;s to the kind in&s;tructions of Mrs. Ley&s;ter, and a re&s;i|dence in the country, which has taught them, that ju&s;tice and moderation are the &s;ecure&s;t means of obtaining true happi|ne&s;s.</P>
