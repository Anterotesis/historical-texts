AFTER all the pertinent, and pious, and &s;ublime Things, which &s;o many of my Fathers and Brethren have advanced upon this Occa&s;ion, there &s;eems to be nothing new for me to add; nor do I readily think of any one proper Topick which has not been touched upon by others before me. However, it has been &s;ometimes ob&s;erved that the Art of Writing, among us in the&s;e latter Days, con&s;i&s;ts not &s;o much in &s;tarting new Matter, (for that were almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible after all the Authors and Volumes which have gone before us) as in &s;etting old Thoughts in a newer, or &s;tronger, or more agreeable, or at iea&s;t in <HI>different</HI> Lights; and as every Author has &s;omething of his own, a <HI>Specifick Quality</HI> which di&s;tingui&s;hes him from others, this mu&s;t be my Excu&s;e for yielding to your unanimous De&s;ire, and irre&s;i&s;tible Importunities, and appearing at your Head this Day.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="004482_0005_100D540C02D26980">
AND if this be a ju&s;t Apology for the <HI>Author,</HI> it is much more &s;o for the <HI>Preacher:</HI> For it is a plain Direction to us, <HI>as wi&s;e Stewards</HI> to <HI>bring out of</HI> our <HI>Trea&s;ury Things new and old.</HI> You will therefore hear with Candor; and though I &s;hould <HI>deliver the &s;ame Things,</HI> to you <HI>they will not be grievous.</HI></P>
<P>ATTEND then to the Voice of my Text. The Words are a gallant Speech of young <HI>David,</HI> ru&s;hing to encounter the tall Giant of <HI>Gath.</HI> Long had the huge Mon&s;ter daily &s;trode towards the Camp of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> and roared his Challenge over the Campaign, to the Ears of the frighted Army. An univer&s;al Panick run through the Ranks, chilled their Blood, and &s;hook their Fabrick. Not a Man, not a Captain bold enough to i&s;&s;ue from their Ports, and engage the brawny Champion: They all &s;hrunk behind their En|trenchments, and retreated from the thundering Defi|ance. Then it was that <HI>David,</HI> by Accident in the Ho&s;t, heard the Menaces of the godle&s;s Giant, and a generous Indignation fired his Brea&s;t. Away goes the blooming Hero to the intimidated Monarch, and de|mands the Combat with <HI>Goliah.</HI> The King is &s;ur|prized at the daring Genius that glowed in a Heart &s;o young, and undi&s;ciplined to the Dangers and Art of War, and hardly con&s;ents to the unequal Fight. "<HI>Thou art but a Youth,</HI> my Son, and he, <HI>a Man of War from his Youth.</HI>" <Q>Why, replied the Ro&s;ey War|riour, why may I not venture? The&s;e unpromi&s;ing Arms of mine, tender as they &s;eem to you, are not unu&s;ed to rugged Encounters. I am the Stripling, that have wre&s;ted a Kid of my Flock from the Paw of a Bear, and from the rubid Jaws of a Lyon; and my God &s;hall alike deliver this Phili&s;tine into my Hand.</Q> A&s;toni&s;hed, <HI>Saul</HI> gives a faint Con|&s;ent; and <HI>David</HI> with a Sling, and a few Pebbles, runs out to the glorious Expedition. <HI>Goliah</HI> &s;aw; and in a

Tran&s;port of Di&s;dain, cur&s;t the little Adventurer by his Gods; "Come hither, Youth, and by Dagon, will I &s;catter thy Limbs a Prey to the Bea&s;ts of the Field, and to the Fowls of the Air." To this boa&s;t|ing Period, the Words of my Text are the ardent Reply; <HI>Thou come&s;t to me with a Sword, and with a Spear, and with a Shield; but I come to thee in the Name of the LORD of Ho&s;ts, the God of the Armies of I&s;rael, whom thou ha&s;t defied.</HI></P>
<P>THERE'S a noble Bravery in th<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> Expre&s;&s;ion. The ardent young Champion takes no Notice of the Bulk and Terror of his Rival's Per&s;on, but &s;eems rather to up|braid him with Cowardi&s;e. Tall and broad, and athletick as you are, &s;ays he, it &s;eems you dare not tru&s;t your+&s;elf again&s;t your little Enemy, without abundant Arms and Armour. <HI>Thou come&s;t to me with a Sword, and with a Spear, and with a Shield; but I come to thee in the Name of the LORD of Ho&s;ts, the God of the Armies of I&s;rael.</HI></P>
<P>MORE than this had been unbecoming the manly Genius of a Warriour. Actions and not Words mu&s;t decide the Di&s;pute. The mighty <HI>Phili&s;tine</HI> ha&s;ted on|ward, and <HI>David</HI> ru&s;hed to meet him with undaunted Eyes, while the Sling in his Hand whirled round, and away &s;ung the Victor-Stone towards the broad Front of the Enemy. It &s;trook, it cru&s;hed, it &s;unk, and down fell the proud Boa&s;ter thundring to the Plain.</P>
<P>THIS was the Courage, and this the Succe&s;s of <HI>David;</HI> and Devotion and Religion was the Spring and the Ba&s;is of all. A Zeal for the GOD of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> in&s;pired his glowing Brea&s;t, and a firm Tru&s;t in Him animated him, undaunted in the Undertaking, com|pounded of Religion and Enterprize.</P>

Two glorious Characters <HI>David</HI> here gives of his GOD; <HI>the Lord of Ho&s;ts,</HI> and the <HI>God of the Armies of I&s;rael,</HI> and all our Fire while he marches on in this great and fearful Name, he faces every Danger intere&s;ted and victorious. <HI>In the Name of GOD I will de&s;troy them; in the Name of GOD I will de&s;troy them.</HI></P>
<P>And as in the glowing Sentence are comprized the Glories of GOD, and the Fortitude of a pious Man: So the Words lead us to di&s;cour&s;e, Fir&s;t of the <HI>Lord of Ho&s;ts;</HI> Secondly, of the <HI>God of the Armies of I&s;rael;</HI> and Thirdly, of the <HI>Nature of true, rational and religious Fortitude,</HI> as taking hence its Origin, a Regard to this glorious GOD.</P>
<P>I. I am to di&s;cour&s;e a little of the <HI>Lord of Ho&s;ts,</HI> and con&s;ider the mo&s;t high GOD under this Cha|racter.</P>
<P>THIS is one of the magnificent and favourite Titles which he wears; and it is about Sixty Times applied to him in the in&s;pired Writings. <HI>The Lord of Ho&s;ts, he is the King of Glory: The Lord of Ho&s;ts is his Name.</HI> Take a View of his extended and potent Armies, and &s;ee him in his Glory at the Head of all.</P>
<P>THE Heavenly Ho&s;ts are his. So are the Angels in all their &s;hining Forms and un-numbered Regi|ments: An immea&s;urable Front, and an endle&s;s Rear! No Army of &s;o exact Di&s;cipline, &s;uch invincible Cou|rage and fatal Execution. Our painted Troops are a meer Mock-Show to the&s;e re&s;i&s;tle&s;s Legions.

<P>II. THE Lord of Ho&s;ts, is in an eminent Sen&s;e, the <HI>God of the Armies of I&s;rael.</HI></P>
<P>HE &s;tands in a peculiar Relation to his Favourite People. So he de&s;cended with his drawn Sword in his Hand, and made his Claim to <HI>Jo&s;hua,</HI> when the intrepid General &s;aw him, and bravely demanded, <HI>Art thou for us, or for our Adver&s;aries?

Compare <HI>Exod.</HI> xxiii. 20, 21. with <HI>Exod.</HI> xxxiii. 2, 3.</P>
<P>WHILE <HI>I&s;rael</HI> was litterally a People, he was im|mediately their LORD.

And what People was there &s;o great, who had GOD &s;o nigh to them? The Ark was a Symbal of his Pre&s;ence; and by it he led them in their March, and by it they halted. <HI>Numb.</HI> x. 35, 36. <HI>And it came to pa&s;s when the Ark &s;et forward, that Mo&s;es &s;aid, Ri&s;e up, LORD, and let thine Ene|mies be &s;cattered; and let them that hate thee, flee before thee.

<P><PB N="18" REF="004482_0015_100D5438EB233680">
AND this favourite Nation was only a Type of the Church to the End of the World. GOD, in the Incarnate Son, is the Captain of their Salvation. He has cho&s;en them out of the World, they are li&s;ted under his Banners, he marches before them conquer|ing and to conquer, and they follow, whither&s;oever he goeth, more than Conquerors through him who loveth them. <HI>The Armies of Heaven follow him.</HI> And who is &s;he that looketh forth as the Morning, fair as the Moon, clear as the Sun, and terrible as an Army with Banners.

He propo&s;es Rewards to the Souldier, and leads the Way through the Labour to the Triumph: <HI>To him that overcometh will I grant to &s;it down with me upon my Throne, even as I al&s;o overcame, and am &s;it down with my Father upon his Throne.</HI></P>
<P>IN every Light he is their GOD. They are all <HI>cho&s;en Men.</HI> He pre&s;t them into Service; and they are al&s;o Voluntiers in his Cau&s;e; bound by Military Oaths and Sacraments. <HI>He is thy Lord, and wor&s;hip thou him.</HI></P>

<P N="1">1. WE learn hence the Immunities of the Church of JESUS CHRIST.

<P>III. To &s;peak of the Doctrine of true Fortitude, as taking hence its Origin, a Regard to the glorious GOD, in every hardy Enterprize.</P>
<P>COURAGE is a Moral Virtue, and a Thing very different from a flu&s;h of Animal Spirits, or a firmne&s;s of Fibres in the Heart and Brain. It mu&s;t have its Foundation in Rea&s;on, (and, &s;hall I add, in Religion; which is the be&s;t Rea&s;on) or it &s;ub&s;ides into Stupidity, or foams up in Frenzy. There are &s;ome Things in|deed ob&s;ervable in the Brutal World, which by way of Analogy we call by Names taken from Moral
<PB N="20" REF="004482_0017_100D543D76912D60">
Virtues. But by no Means are they to be &s;trictly under|&s;tood. So we &s;peak of the <HI>Courage</HI> of the <HI>Lyon</HI> and the <HI>War-Hor&s;e,</HI> and even the <HI>Charity</HI> and <HI>Piety</HI> of the <HI>Stork</HI> feeding its aged Parents. But if we under&s;tand litterally the&s;e Virtues, the pure Effects of Nature in Creatures incapable of Moral Government; methinks one had as good fini&s;h the Scheme at once, applaud the <HI>Patience</HI> of a <HI>Log,</HI> and compliment a <HI>Block</HI> for <HI>Pa&s;&s;ive Obedience and Non Re&s;i&s;tance.</HI></P>
<P>No; Courage is that Firmne&s;s of Mind which will enable a Man, from Principle, to abide by the Dictates of his Rational Nature again&s;t all Oppo&s;ition. Some Men, indeed, have a natural Con&s;titution that is a Mechanical Aid to this Virtue: Others, from the unhappier Fabrick of the Body, and the feebler Con|&s;i&s;tence of the Fluids are more liable to Temptations from the contrary Vices of Diffidence and Cowardi&s;e. But &s;till the Virtues and Vices are di&s;tinct from the&s;e material Operations: Their Foundation is Principle&punc; and their Subject is the Mind of a Moral Agent.</P>
<P>How many Actions have been applauded among Men as highly Heroick, which examined to the Bot|tom will be found really mean; I will venture to add, <HI>the pure Effects of a da&s;tardly Spirit.</HI> Such I pro|nounce <HI>the SPIRIT OF A DUEL.</HI> I believe upon impartial Enquiry it will be found that a Duel has been &s;eldom undertaken but from the ignominious Power of Fear. Rea&s;on, and Religion, and the Man's own Inclinations have all con&s;pired to forbid the Fact, but the poor Paltroon has not had Pre&s;ence of Mind, and Bravery of Re&s;olution, to &s;tand by the Dictates of his Under&s;tanding and Con&s;cience, only for <HI>Fear</HI> of being laugh'd at. Call you this <HI>Courage,</HI> who&s;e Ori|ginal and Spring is all paltry Fear? So many a Coward has kept the Field, purely by being afraid to

<P>THE Fortitude of the true Hero di&s;dains to a&s;k any Que&s;tions, but,&mdash;<HI>What is the pre&s;ent Duty?</HI> But 'tis the true Character of a Coward to con&s;ult,&mdash;<HI>What Evil can I be&s;t bear?</HI> And if from a di&s;tracted Judg|ment, Death and Divine Vengeance at a di&s;tance, do not &s;o much fright him as the pre&s;ent Contempt of Mankind, the Da&s;tard chu&s;es <HI>Damnation</HI> rather than <HI>Ridicule.</HI></P>

Victor; but the Crown of Life that fadeth not away.</P>
<P>IN the mean Time let our Examples and our Di&s;|cour&s;es in&s;pire Courage into the Brea&s;ts of the Militant Ho&s;ts of GOD below: And while <HI>I&s;rael</HI> encounters her Enemies let the Prie&s;ts blow the Trumpets.</P>
<P>II. LET us all, from what we have heard, li&s;t our &s;elves Volunteers in the Ho&s;ts of GOD. Let us make &s;ure of our Maker's Friend&s;hip through JESUS CHRIST; and this be the Foundation of our Courage, <HI>I know whom I have believed.</HI> There's nothing irra|tional or enthu&s;ia&s;tick in this. A Man may upon the mo&s;t &s;olid Principles be a&s;&s;ured of the Truth of the Chri&s;tian Religion: And he may be as rationally &s;atisfied of his own being a true Chri&s;tian. And the&s;e being a&s;certained,&mdash;<HI>The Lord is my Light and my Sal|vation, whom &s;hall I fear? The Lord is the Strength of my Life, of whom &s;hall I be afraid.</HI> Nor Life nor Death can hurt us; all Things &s;hall con&s;pire our Good. <HI>Watch ye, &s;tand fa&s;t in the Faith, quit you like Men, be &s;trong.</HI> Look with a di&s;dainful Smile upon all your armed Enemies, you have more numerous and powerful Auxiliaries. There is more with us than with them. The Angel of the Lord encampeth round about them that fear him; and lo! the Mountain crowded with Chariots and Hor&s;es of Fire.</P>
<P>III. From what you have heard, you infer, a Man may lawfully engage in War. He may go in the Name of the Lord of Ho&s;ts. This is a Subject that has been often handled upon the&s;e Occa&s;ions, and to out &s;hort the Matter, the Proof may take this direct Cour&s;e. Is there any Man upon Earth, who does not own that a Criminal ought to be puni&s;hed? But &s;uppo&s;e this Criminal &s;tands upon his own De|fence,
<PB N="28" REF="004482_0025_100D544C60156100">
and is re&s;olved to attack every one that &s;hall attempt to puni&s;h him: Suppo&s;e he engages a Number of others to &s;tand by him, and to fight for him rather than deliver him&s;elf up; what &s;hall be done in this Ca&s;e? Shall the Officers of Ju&s;tice let him alone, if they cannot per&s;wade him to Cha&s;ti&s;ement by Dint of Eloquence? This were to let the mo&s;t egregious Cri|minal go free, and correct only the more mode&s;t: The harden'd Villain would e&s;cape, and, in a Sen&s;e which <HI>Solomon</HI> never meant, <HI>The Rod would be only for the Fool's Back.</HI> It mu&s;t then be lawful by Force, to make a Thief, for In&s;tance, refund his unju&s;t Gains, and by Puni&s;hment deter him from future Ravages. This is the Ca&s;e of a Nation engaged in a lawful War. It has been pillaged by a Combination of Thieves: The&s;e unrea&s;onable Banditti ought to make Re&s;titution, and for many Rea&s;ons, &s;ubmit to Di&s;cipline, but the refractory Men &s;tand upon their Defence. There's no other Way left then but to march out in the Name of GOD, and overpower them by Force. And as the Laws of particular Kingdoms have appointed &s;uch and &s;uch particular Men, as the Mini&s;ters of GOD to ex<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">c<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">te Vengeance; the Law of Nations in general gives to every People Authority to protect them&s;elves, and to puni&s;h tho&s;e who injure them as far as they are able, as their own Executors. So that Fighting may be as nece&s;&s;ary as Laws them&s;elves; for what &s;ignify Laws without Sanctions.</P>
<P>BUT I have &s;tood longer than I intended, and mu&s;t now di&s;mi&s;s you.</P>
<P>GENTLEMEN,</P>
<P>You profe&s;s Skill in Arms, and would be a&s;hamed of any thing like Cowardi&s;e. You are a Band of cho|&s;en Men, the Head and the Flower of all our Militia.
<PB N="29" REF="004482_0026_100D544E3A9709E8">
To honour Arms, and add a Glory to your Order, I have &s;et before you the great GOD as the Lord of Ho&s;ts. And at the &s;ame Time I have recommended to you the &s;ure&s;t way to arrive at true Fortitude, that greate&s;t Glory of a Souldier: A religious Regard to the great GOD the Ba&s;is of rational Courage; without which all Pretences to it are no better than the Stupi|dity of a Stock, or the Rage of a Brute. Be ambitious of this Title, THE CHRISTIAN HERO.</P>
<P>YOU may now bear on fearle&s;s of every Danger, &s;hould the GOD of Armies call you to immediate Service. How &s;oon this may be GOD knows; for your Mu&s;ters are now &s;omething more than pretty Amu&s;ements, while the Sword of an injur'd Nation is un&s;heathed, and Vengeance is thundred from the Mouth of her Cannon. Hark! to the Sound of the Trumpet and Alarm of War! Hear the ru&s;hing of Nations, that make a Noi&s;e like the Sea, a ru&s;hing, like the ru&s;hing of mighty Waters! Methinks I can there|fore addre&s;s you with a better Grace, than when the&s;e things only appeared at a di&s;tance, and your Exerci&s;es looked le&s;s in earne&s;t. Sure you will not make a Flouri&s;h in a Game, and when the Field gleams with ho&s;tile Terrors bear to be in&s;ulted with the keen Sarca&s;m Judg. ix. 38. <HI>Where is now thy Mouth, wherewith thou &s;aid&s;t, who is Abimelech&mdash;? Is not this the People that thou ha&s;t de&s;pi&s;ed? Go out now and fight with them.</HI></P>
<P>WE are certainly a mo&s;t expo&s;ed People, and in our unfortified Po&s;ture &s;eem to lye an ea&s;y Prey to the fir&s;t Invader. 'Tis not for me to charge the Fault of this any where: Only to pray GOD that &s;ome happy Method may open for the Redre&s;s of this Grievance. <HI>Do good in thy good Plea&s;ure unto Zion; build thou the Walls of thy Jeru&s;alem. David</HI> him&s;elf, with

all his Courage and Divine Commi&s;&s;ion, would not encounter his Enemy without &s;ome Arms; a Sling and a Stone at lea&s;t, the Weapons which he knew be&s;t how to manage. To have gone in the Name of the Lord of Ho&s;ts without, had been an unwarrantable Pre&s;umption. While we have been &s;itting at Ea&s;e amid&s;t the Ruins of our falling Batteries, without &s;o much as a Sling-Stone to defend us: Or rather have &s;een our di&s;jointed Fortifications dropping into &s;eperate Stones of no u&s;e but for the Sling: In&s;tead of Bul|warks a few loo&s;e Pebbles. My Brethren, the&s;e Things ought not &s;o to be. However, <HI>the Name of the LORD is &s;till our &s;trong Tower, the Righteous fly to it and are &s;aved.</HI> So <HI>our Place of Defence &s;hall be the Munitions of Rocks.</HI></P>
<P>BUT You, Gentlemen, will do what in you lies to diffu&s;e Skill and Valour through your &s;everal Regi|ments and Companies; that at lea&s;t we may keep our Country, &s;hould we be obliged to give up our Fron|tiers on the Sea. A &s;mall Number of di&s;ciplined Troops will over-match a Rout of Thou&s;ands. So a few Men uniting their Strength, &s;hall be able with ea&s;e, to lift a Weight, which Ten times the Number trying &s;eperately &s;hall not be able to move. This is the Rea&s;on that all the military Movements and Fires &s;hould be exactly together, that the whole Battallion may act as one, with irri&s;i&s;tible Forces. The Drum and the Trumpet &s;hould be articulate to every Souldier, and he &s;hould know at the fir&s;t Notes, the Charge, the Retreat, and the Parley. Every Man &s;hould be ac|quainted with his Duty, and be exact to the Word of Command. The whole Succe&s;s of an Engagement, and the Fate of a Country, under GOD, depends upon this one Military Maxim.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="004482_0028_100D545301852130">
AND with how much Calm of Mind may you at|tend to it, in the mid&s;t of the mo&s;t hazardous Enter|prize, if you can but a&s;&s;ure your &s;elves you are ven|turing in the Name of the Lord of Ho&s;ts; and he is engaged for you. Then, to advance will not be ter|rible; to retreat will not be &s;hameful; for all will be under the &s;erene Conduct of Rea&s;on and Duty. You will not be meanly elated by the compleate&s;t Victory; nor afraid to fall in the hotte&s;t Battle; but with an equal Mind hear the Shouts of Triumph and the Groans of Death. <HI>Thou &s;halt not be afraid for the Terror by Night, nor for the Arrow that flyeth by Day. A thou&s;and &s;hall fall at thy Side, and ten thou&s;and at thy right Hand,</HI> and thou &s;halt not be moved. <HI>Thou &s;halt tread upon the Lyon and Adder; the young Lyon and the Dragon thou &s;halt trample under Feet.&mdash;Go up and pro&s;per: The LORD is with thee, thou mighty Man of Valour.</HI></P>
