<P>THE occa&s;ion on which the following Di&s;cour&s;e was delivered, ought not to be deemed too incon&s;idera|ble for any farther notice. The opening of an <HI>African Church,</HI> in <HI>America;</HI> and, perhaps, <HI>the fir&s;t,</HI> is a remark|able event in the progre&s;s of Chri&s;tian knowledge. At the reque&s;t, therefore, of the People expre&s;sly concern|ed, and with the countenance of &s;everal mo&s;t re&s;pecta|ble characters, who wi&s;h well to them, the Author of this Di&s;cour&s;e, a&s;&s;ents now to its proceeding from the pre&s;s. It was prepared in unavoidable ha&s;te, and un|der &s;uch peculiar circum&s;tances of failure of health at the time, that it could not have been undertaken at all, or even tolerably executed, when undertaken, had it not been for <HI>Dr. Ru&s;h</HI>'s di&s;tingui&s;hed attentions, and his mo&s;t valuable hints, of which the Preacher was fortunate in availing him&s;elf.</P>
<P>The familiarity of the <HI>Stile,</HI> and plainne&s;s in the <HI>manner</HI> of addre&s;s, it is to be pre&s;umed, require no apology.</P>

<P>O Lord, our heavenly Father, almighty and everla&s;t|ing God; Creator, Pre&s;erver, and Governor of the Univer&s;e; regard, we be&s;eech thee, the prayers and prai&s;es we this day offer unto thy divine Maje&s;ty, in the place which we are now a&s;&s;embled in, to dedicate unto thee. Dwell in this hou&s;e, we pray thee; accept and &s;anctify it, as an holy Temple, devoted to thy &s;ervice, and to the maintenance of thy true religion and virtue.</P>
<P>We know, O Lord, that thou dwelle&s;t not in Tem|ples made with hands, &s;o as to be circum&s;cribed by them, as thou ha&s;t created the boundle&s;s expan&s;e of Heaven

Yet, though thy divine nature be thus unlimited, vouch|&s;afe, we be&s;eech thee, to be more e&s;pecially pre&s;ent in this Sanctuary, by thy grace and heavenly benediction; that, as often as two or three are gathered together <HI>here</HI> in thy name, thou maye&s;t be in the mid&s;t of them, to hear and to fulfil their petitions: &s;o that this hou&s;e may be for ever &s;acred to the wor&s;hip of thee the only true God; where the Go&s;pel of thy ble&s;&s;ed &s;on, our &s;aviour Je&s;us Chri&s;t, may be faithfully preached, and the Sacra|ments of his in&s;titution rightly and duly admini&s;tered&mdash;that Go&s;pel, which is "the power of God unto &s;alvation to as many as believe"&mdash;tho&s;e holy Sacraments, which, being worthily received, are able to "nouri&s;h us unto eternal life."</P>
<P>And do thou, O merciful God, who before all Tem|ples, prefere&s;t a pure and upright heart; enlighten, pre&s;erve, convert us. "May thy Prie&s;ts," <HI>here</HI> mini|&s;tering before thee, "be clothed with righteou&s;ne&s;s, and may thy Saints," uttering their re&s;pon&s;es, "&s;ing with joyfulne&s;s."

May they ever po&s;&s;e&s;s a lively remembrance of the mercy thou ha&s;t vouch&s;afed unto them, in being graciou&s;ly plea|&s;ed to call them out of the darkne&s;s of Pagani&s;m, and the bondage of ignorance and error, into the clear light of Go&s;pel Revelation, and "the glorious liberty of the children of God." May their under&s;tandings be ever|more illuminated by that heavenly light, and may they ever "&s;tand fa&s;t in that liberty wherewith Chri&s;t hath made them free." May they &s;o diligently learn the precepts of thy ble&s;&s;ed &s;on, and &s;o con&s;tantly follow his good example, that, having faithfully wor&s;hipped thee in thy church upon earth, they may, when the pre&s;ent period of their probation &s;hall be accompli&s;hed, be admit|ted to the general a&s;&s;embly and church of the fir&s;t-born

<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL>ISAIAH ix, 2.</BIBL>
<P>THE PEOPLE THAT WALKED IN DARKNESS HAVE SEEN A GREAT LIGHT.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>AS <HI>I pa&s;&s;ed by,</HI> &s;oon after the walls of this Build|ing were carried up,&mdash;<HI>and beheld</HI> the Marble on the Ea|&s;tern Front, <HI>in&s;cribed</HI> with the&s;e words, my attention was exceedingly attracted by them; for I was &s;truck with the propriety of &s;uch a <HI>choice.</HI> And, I know of none more &s;uitable to direct our thoughts on the pre&s;ent intere&s;ting occa&s;ion. They relate to the Gentiles; and, this day, they have their accompli&s;hment here.</P>
<P>Ble&s;&s;ed God! who are the&s;e <HI>that gather them&s;elves to|gether?</HI> They <HI>come to thee!</HI> They <HI>come, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> by light,</HI> and <HI>to the brightne&s;s of its ri&s;ing. The &s;ons of &s;trangers do build up thy walls</HI>&mdash;Their children's children <HI>&s;hall mini&s;ter unto thee.&mdash;In thy wrath did&s;t thou &s;mite them, but in thy favour ha&s;t thou had mercy on them.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;tile of holy Scripture is often figurative; and notices are taken from familiar objects, and circum&s;tances generally known, in common life, in order to convey &s;piritual conceptions with the greater clearne&s;s, and to render their impre&s;&s;ion the &s;tronger and more abiding. This is remarkably &s;een in the writings of the &s;ublime I&s;aiah. We have an in&s;tance of it before us, in the Text,&mdash;where the words Darkne&s;s, and Light, which, literally, denote qualities univer&s;ally under&s;tood, as they re&s;pect worldly things, are applied to certain qualities and conditions relative to &s;piritual things.</P>
<P>&mdash;"The people that walked in Darkne&s;s"&mdash;is the Prophet's expre&s;&s;ion;&mdash;"The people" who lived in
<PB N="10" REF="027259_0008_0FD3F32E2739DEC0">
blindne&s;s and error, <HI>have &s;een a great light,</HI>&mdash;the light of the truth&mdash;the light of the glorious go&s;pel of Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>With &s;ome variation, how &s;trongly is the &s;ame thought repre&s;ented in the clo&s;e of the ver&s;e&mdash;"they that dwell in the land of the &s;hadow of death, upon them hath the light &s;hined."&mdash;</P>
<P>&mdash;Yes; of all darkne&s;s, that of the Soul is mo&s;t dark: and of all who wander&mdash;the wanderers from the path of life, are mo&s;t forlorn, and to be pitied.&mdash;Of cour&s;e, Divine illumination, the light from God, is, of all things, the mo&s;t precious.</P>
<P><HI>You</HI> are a people who have "walked in Darkne&s;s."</P>
<P><HI>You</HI> who walked in darkne&s;s, have been favoured with a change of that condition; you have been brought <HI>to &s;ee Light</HI>: And</P>
<P>That Light is a glorious one&mdash;a <HI>great</HI> Light.</P>
<P>From the&s;e con&s;iderations, do clearly flow certain Du|ties, which eminently claim your ob&s;ervance.</P>
<P N="1">I. YOU are a People who "have walked in dark|ne&s;s."</P>
<P N="1">1. In being brought up as Pagans, or Heathen, unac|quainted with Divine Revelation, and the covenant of grace, <HI>in your own country.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is meant of the <HI>general</HI> &s;tate of the black people, or Africans.</NOTE></P>
<P>Your fathers, and &s;ome, perhaps, of you now pre&s;ent, did, near the &s;hores of <HI>Senegal</HI> and <HI>Gambia,</HI> on this or the other ill-fated range, or coa&s;t, of <HI>Africa,</HI>&mdash;may be in <HI>Be|nin, Congo</HI> or <HI>Angola,</HI>&mdash;ignorant of "God that made the world, and all things therein,"&mdash;bow down in adoration before &s;tocks, &s;tones, bea&s;ts, and the vile&s;t creeping things,&mdash;pray to the hollow winds; or, dancing in wild circles, mutter to Devils;&mdash;or, in affrighted gaze, yell to the pale moon, to &s;ave you!&mdash;And it is known, that proportioned to the degrees of darkne&s;s, in the aforementioned re&s;pects,&mdash;e&s;pecially the "gro&s;s dark|ne&s;s" covering the people,&mdash;mu&s;t, of cour&s;e, be the corrupt &s;tate of their manners.</P>
<P N="2">2. You have "walked in darkne&s;s," as being &s;laves in <HI>this country</HI>&mdash;for &s;lavery, and darkne&s;s, or ignorance, go hand in hand.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="027259_0009_0FD3F32E2BB95430">Can a poor African, dragged in fetters from his native land,&mdash;and here, driven and tormented under the la&s;hes of cruelty, be any thing el&s;e than dark, dark! Can a people, kept back from knowledge, expre&s;sly for this rea&s;on&mdash;le&s;t it &s;hould unfit them for being bea&s;ts of bur|den,&mdash;<HI>can they</HI> be any other than dark?</P>
<P>To the credit of humanity, in <HI>this</HI> part of America, and &s;everal other parts, <HI>&s;uch treatment</HI> hath been held in abhorrence. It is unknown, except in narratives from abroad.</P>
<P>Still, at the very be&s;t, &s;lavery is an hard allotment. It &s;inks the mind, no le&s;s than the body: it weakens its ca|pacity: de&s;troys all <HI>principle</HI>; corrupts its feelings; prevents it from either di&s;cerning, or choo&s;ing aright in any thing. Yes&mdash;and in the proportion that it exi&s;ts any where, it has its effect in vitiating the general manners.</P>
<P>PENNSYLVANIA!&mdash;thou ha&s;t con&s;idered this: Thou ha&s;t mitigated its ills, in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, and in the mo&s;t proper manner which the evil would admit of, art pur&s;u|ing the plans for its entire abolition.</P>
<P N="3">3. You "have walked in darkne&s;s," as <HI>&s;inners.</HI> In this re&s;pect, all mankind are upon a footing&mdash;they all <HI>walk in darkne&s;s.</HI> The term is fitly cho&s;en indeed, to expre&s;s <HI>the &s;tate of man.</HI> He has lo&s;t &s;ight of his chief end, and of the means to attain it. He mi&s;takes his &s;upreme good. He wanders in crooked paths. He expo&s;es him&s;elf conti|nually to dangers. He falls into innumerable vices and corruptions&mdash;and no wonder&mdash;for he walketh in darkne&s;s.</P>
<P>This darkne&s;s may be con&s;idered in a two-fold view,&mdash;as <HI>external</HI> and <HI>internal.</HI> The <HI>external</HI> darkne&s;s includes that &s;tate of things in the world, which is oppo&s;ed to the knowledge of God, and true religion; tho&s;e circum&s;tan|ces &s;everally, or taken together, which the <HI>evil one</HI> makes u&s;e of, as a medium, through which, to carry on his own foul bu&s;ine&s;s. It comprehends all tho&s;e erroneous &s;y&s;|tems of religion which prevailed among the different na|tions, before the appearing of the Me&s;&s;iah, Je&s;us Chri&s;t; and all the &s;chemes or &s;y&s;tems, whatever may be their names, that have been &s;ub&s;tituted for his religion, &s;ince.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="027259_0010_0FD3F33049A34130">The <HI>internal</HI> darkne&s;s is &s;eated in man's mind. It is an immoral di&s;po&s;ition of the heart; a corrupt &s;tate of the affections. It is THE ENMITY AGAINST GOD, &s;poken of by St. Paul. It is that aching, wrathful aby&s;s (if I may &s;o expre&s;s it) <HI>void and without form</HI>&mdash;till the &s;pirit of God "moveth upon the face of it," and &s;aith, "Let there be light."&mdash;</P>
<P>The depraved condition of the &s;oul, being the dread|ful effect of man's fall, you find &s;et forth in holy &s;crip|ture, by no expre&s;&s;ion &s;o frequent, as that of "Darkne&s;s." And, what is very ob&s;ervable&mdash;this internal darkne&s;s al|ways implies that extreme evil, <HI>Unbelief</HI>&mdash;a di&s;tru&s;t in the Almighty, and his declarations: and, in relation to the redemption offered to the world&mdash;it is a refu&s;al to ac|cept thereof, or to comply with its gracious terms.</P>
<P N="2">II. In the next place, let us ob&s;erve, agreeably to our text, that a "People that walked in darkne&s;s," <HI>external,</HI> and <HI>internal,</HI> "have &s;een a great light."&mdash; They have perceived by the eye of their under&s;tanding&mdash;they have di&s;covered&mdash;they have become acquainted with, that which will guide them to liberty and happine&s;s.</P>
<P>By this "great light," is meant the knowledge of true religion&mdash;the in&s;truction contained in the go&s;pel of Je&s;us Chri&s;t;&mdash;"the light of the glory of God in the face" of his beloved Son,&mdash;who is him&s;elf called "the light of men;" "the true light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world." Verily, under the circum&s;tances in which his world lay by rea&s;on of &s;in; and, in the expectations of deliverance through the grace and virtue of a me&s;&s;enger &s;ent from GOD, who is <HI>the eternal e&s;&s;ential light;</HI> there could not be a more pro|per word &s;ummarily to characterize that divine me&s;&s;enger, than LIGHT. Well therefore, may the beautiful meta|phor be u&s;ed, as it often is, to de&s;ignate or expre&s;s <HI>his influence.</HI> This is called light, as oppo&s;ed to darkne&s;s. It di&s;pels darkne&s;s. It irradiates the external and inter|nal hemi&s;phere of the mind. It is that <HI>&s;piritual</HI> medium of &s;ight, by which we <HI>&s;ee</HI> &s;piritually. It &s;hows God to be what he is. Our altars need no more to have this in&s;cription, TO THE UNKNOWN GOD. It reveals his name, his nature, his perfections.&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="027259_0011_0FD3F3321588C970">It &s;hows man, as a creature, and a &s;inner. It &s;hows him in a very different view from what he is di&s;po&s;ed to con&s;ider him&s;elf, by the light of his own rea&s;on. It di&s;|covers to him his littlene&s;s, his dependance on a &s;uperior, his depravity,&mdash;and withal, his utter inability to &s;ave him&s;elf. Particularly, does it open <HI>the way of &s;alvation;</HI> &s;etting forth, in a manner mo&s;t comfortable, mo&s;t ea&s;y to be under&s;tood by people of all capacities&mdash;high, or low,&mdash;that "God may be ju&s;t, and yet the ju&s;tifier of him who believeth in Je&s;us." It &s;hows, that grace is the true &s;pring of holine&s;s: that divine pardon produces divine peace; and this peace to be in&s;eparable from puri|ty and virtue. It &s;hows, moreover, all the &s;ocial and re|lative duties; and points out the connection of each of them with the glory of God, and with general and indi|vidual happine&s;s. Yes, my brethren,&mdash;and to complete the whole, it opens the divine abodes of exi&s;tence in the world to come. It carries your hopes &s;tedfa&s;t and &s;ure, to the morning of that bright day, in the which, the re|deemed ones &s;hall put on immortality,&mdash;&s;hall all meet one another, and meet the Lord;&mdash;when dignity and ex|cellence that cannot now be uttered, &s;hall be theirs for ever.</P>
<P N="3">III. It is called a <HI>great</HI> light. Let us enquire into the rea&s;ons of this epithet. It is <HI>great,</HI> both with re&s;pect to its <HI>object,</HI> its <HI>origin,</HI> and its <HI>circum&s;tances.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. Its object: Here indeed, there is not <HI>one</HI> only; but many: and in the like multiplied view, may the ori|gin be contemplated, together with the other particu|lars.</P>
<P>In regard to the fir&s;t,&mdash;I &s;hall try a moment to direct your attention to the principal of all&mdash;It is a <HI>great</HI> light, becau&s;e it manife&s;ts to the world, the <HI>Great Being.</HI> The knowledge of God, or the religious im|pre&s;&s;ion of an intelligent, almighty <HI>Cau&s;e</HI> of all things,&mdash;"the rewarder of them that diligently &s;eek him," is as <HI>e&s;&s;ential</HI> to human happine&s;s, as the breath we draw, is now to human life. Man may exi&s;t without knowing God: but exi&s;tence merely is not happine&s;s. A &s;en&s;ibili|ty on our part, of the relation we &s;tand in to the infinite|ly great and good Creator, and of the duty flowing from that relation,&mdash;it is this that gives man his dignified
<PB N="14" REF="027259_0012_0FD3F3337A1CBD50">
place in the arrangement of the univer&s;e. Yet, it is too certain, to be di&s;puted, that &s;uch knowledge or &s;en&s;ibili|ty might, through human degeneracy and weakne&s;s, in a great mea&s;ure, or altogether become lo&s;t.&mdash;It actu|ally did &s;o&mdash;What was the &s;tate of the world, in this re&s;pect, before the revelation of go&s;pel light? What hath been its &s;tate ever &s;ince, in places where that light has not reached? or in minds which refu&s;e its friendly aid, under all the circum&s;tances that appreciate and re|commend it? One cannot give a more expre&s;s, and at the &s;ame time, a more full an&s;wer to the above, than in the&s;e few &s;criptural words, "Having no hope, and <HI>without God.</HI>"&mdash;</P>
<P>The great light I am &s;peaking of, immediately tends to the removing from human minds, that ob&s;curity which covered them, with regard to that infinite Being.

<P>Another object of this light, enhancing its exalted na|ture and qualities; I mean the great &s;alvation by the go&s;pel of Je&s;us Chri&s;t; a &s;alvation from &s;in and death, in|to holine&s;s and life eternal: for, wherever its gracious influence is experienced&mdash;<HI>there</HI> peace is e&s;tabli&s;hed; the dominion of &s;atan is overturned, and a new domini|on fixed in the &s;oul&mdash;the reign of God; new principles are implanted&mdash;the principles of light and love; a new life communicated&mdash;the life of heaven.</P>

<P>It is <HI>great,</HI></P>
<P N="1">(1.) Becau&s;e it comes from the <HI>Great</HI> Being, "the Father of Lights," the Author and Creator of all things. He "who commanded light to &s;hine out of darkne&s;s," <HI>in the beginning,</HI>&mdash;hath now "&s;hined into our hearts, to give us" this light.</P>

It was conveyed by him, who was THE WORD, and in the beginning, "with God;" &mdash;"who hath a name above every name;" of whom it is &s;aid, as "the fir&s;t begotten," "and let all the an|gels of God wor&s;hip him;" and "thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever"&mdash;upon who&s;e &s;houlder is "the government," as Mediator&mdash;the WONDERFUL,&mdash;the <HI>Coun&s;ellor,</HI> the <HI>Mighty God</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Mighty Lord, or Heir of all things&mdash;Lord over all.</NOTE>, the <HI>Everla&s;ting Father</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The Father of the perpetual <HI>age to come,</HI> the age of the Go&s;pel.</NOTE>, the <HI>Prince of Peace</HI>&mdash;"able and willing to &s;ave unto the uttermo&s;t:" I repeat it,&mdash;This light, this "Wi&s;|dom, which is from above," conveyed by Him, mu&s;t be <HI>great.</HI></P>

through who&s;e divine irradiations, the ancient prophets, and all the men of God from the beginning, &s;aw, and foretold the &s;everal periods of the Me&s;&s;iah's kingdom;&mdash; its dawn, its commencement, its gradual unfolding, and the unutterable glory in which it is to i&s;&s;ue;&mdash;the Spirit, who&s;e guidance and in&s;piration were given in a manner &s;till more extraordinary, unto the Apo&s;tles&mdash;leading them unto all truth: bringing to their remembrance all that their Ma&s;ter had taught them; enduing them with miraculous powers; accompanying their preaching with irre&s;i&s;tible energy and demon&s;tration; in&s;tructing them how to an|&s;wer and refute their adver&s;aries; &s;upporting them and their pious followers again&s;t the &s;pirit and malice of the world; qualifying them &s;everally to fulfil the great pur|po&s;es of the mini&s;try; and abiding with all the faithful &s;ervants of Chri&s;t, mini&s;ters and people, to the end of the world: the Spirit who is the author at fir&s;t, and the pro|moter ever afterwards, of all &s;aving impre&s;&s;ions, graci|ous influences, and heavenly virtues in the human mind; &mdash;the in&s;pirer of the gifts of faith, of purity, of love, of con&s;olation:&mdash;Through his agency and operation, is this <HI>light</HI> communicated.</P>
<P N="3">3. I &s;aid it is <HI>great,</HI> in relation to the circum&s;tances ap|pertaining to it: and this is the third head, with which the con&s;ideration of the greatne&s;s of this light, &s;upplies me.</P>
<P N="1">(1) It is <HI>great,</HI> becau&s;e it hath endured a great while &mdash;from the fall of man, to the pre&s;ent day. It is as old as the creation. With its early rays it comforted and refre&s;hed the patriarchs. Increa&s;ing gradually, it was a guide to the prophets. From one age to another, down to the "fulne&s;s of the time," it taught the good and ju&s;t, to "live by faith." It was reflected back in hope and con&s;olation, from every type and ordinance of the law. It encircled every altar. It interpreted every &s;acrifice. It enabled the members of the church of God, to look through each emblem and &s;hadow, to the &s;ub|&s;tance. In a word,&mdash;it may be traced in a di&s;tingui&s;hable &s;tream, up to the beginning of time: it will extend down to the end of time; and it will &s;hine more and more "un|to the perfect day."</P>
<P N="2">(2.) It is <HI>great,</HI> becau&s;e it &s;hall illuminate the whole world. Yes, "from the ri&s;ing of the &s;un, unto the go|ing

<P>"One tide of glory, one unclouded blaze"&mdash; &s;hall cover the earth.&mdash;</P>
<P>Innumerable pa&s;&s;ages of Scripture prove the future univer&s;al prevalence of this light: meanwhile, the hap|pie&s;t compari&s;ons, and mo&s;t expre&s;&s;ive charming pro&s;pects are made u&s;e of often, to repre&s;ent its excellency and increa&s;ing brightne&s;s.</P>
<P>I refer you, particularly to the Book of P&s;alms;&mdash; to the Prophets, I&s;aiah, Zechariah, and Malachi;&mdash; to the books of the holy Go&s;pel, expre&s;sly &s;o named;&mdash; to the epi&s;tles of St. Paul,&mdash;and the revelation of St. John: the &s;ub&s;tance of their report, is, That by the prevailing and expanding of this light, the "Dominion" of Chri&s;t, &s;hall be from &s;ea, even to &s;ea; and from the rivers, even to the ends of the earth<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. 7<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE>: That every where, the walls of his church &s;hall be called "&s;alvation, and its gates prai&s;e<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">I&s;a. 60.</NOTE>:" That "in every place, incen&s;e &s;hall be offered to his name, and a pure offering<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mal 1.</NOTE>:" That "the wilder|ne&s;&s;es and &s;olitary places &s;hall be univer&s;ally made glad; and the de&s;erts &s;hall blo&s;&s;om as the ro&s;e<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">I&s;a. 35.1.</NOTE>;&mdash;The mountains exult,&mdash;the vales be filled with melody;&mdash; the trees of every fore&s;t break forth into &s;inging<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Ch. 44.</NOTE>:&mdash; the eyes of the blind be opened, and the ears of the deaf un&s;topped<NOTE N="&para;" PLACE="foot">Ch. 29.

<P N="3"><PB N="18" REF="027259_0016_0FD3CDCFA0986410">(3.) La&s;tly, it is <HI>great,</HI> becau&s;e, as it will &s;hine on, with uncea&s;ing lu&s;tre, until the end of time; &s;o it will &s;hine hereafter, in the glory which it produces, throughout all eternity.</P>
<P>From the words thus opened and explained, there clearly ari&s;e certain duties, which you are expre&s;sly con|cerned in. Allow me, with affectionate plainne&s;s to &s;tate and recommend them.</P>
<P N="1">1. The fir&s;t is, <HI>Gratitude to God,</HI> for having directed, in his own wi&s;e Providence, that you &s;hould come from a land of Pagan darkne&s;s, to a land of Go&s;pel light; from a &s;tate, afterwards, of &s;lavery, to a &s;tate of liberty; and now, from guilt and &s;infulne&s;s, to this &s;tate of &s;alvation, through our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>As for tho&s;e who brought you, or your fathers, from your own country,&mdash;one may &s;ay of them, with a little variation,&mdash;becau&s;e of the different circum&s;tances&mdash;as <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> &s;aid to his brethren, "But as for you, ye thought evil again&s;t us; but God meant it unto good, to bring to pa&s;s, as it is this day, to &s;ave much people alive."</P>
<P>I am aware, that your condition, or ca&s;es &s;everally, may differ a good deal, one from the other. I will &s;pe|cify an in&s;tance, and con&s;ider it with you, a moment; not lo&s;ing &s;ight of the gratitude ju&s;t mentioned.&mdash;As the greater number of you are free; &s;o, there may be others of you yet in bondage: the&s;e neverthele&s;s, have received mercies enow to thank God for. His di&s;pen&s;ati|ons are unque&s;tionably wi&s;e and proper. Whatever he permits, will turn to the real profit of &s;uch as do re&s;ign them&s;elves to his good plea&s;ure. Your pre&s;ent &s;ituation does not hinder you from being <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s freemen. Your pre&s;ent &s;ituation gives you &s;ome advantages above what others have: yes, and very po&s;&s;ibly, above what your Ma&s;ters have,&mdash;in that your humblene&s;s of mind, your patience, faithfulne&s;s, and tru&s;t only in God, will add to the greatne&s;s of your future happine&s;s.</P>
<P N="2">2. The next duty is <HI>gratitude</HI> to your <HI>earthly benefac|tors,</HI> who planned your emancipation from &s;lavery.</P>
<P>There are certain evils, which, when once they have obtained footing, and become <HI>epidemick,</HI> as it were, are &s;carcely &s;een as evils: no wonder then if they be &s;low and difficult to remove: &s;o it hath been with &s;lavery. A few humane, con&s;iderate per&s;ons, at an early period of our
<PB N="19" REF="027259_0017_0FD3F33AF9C39900">
&s;ettlement in this country,&mdash;yes, in <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> particu|larly, were moved by the Divine Spirit, to open <HI>light</HI> upon this darkne&s;s. Their Te&s;timony was treated as vi&s;iona|ry for a while; but, in time, it gained upon the judge|ment and con&s;ciences of men.</P>
<P>Here, you will recollect the names of LAY, of WOOL|MAN,&mdash;and above all, ANTHONY BENEZET;&mdash;who&s;e labours were unwearied in your behalf; who&s;e works of benevolence and love, have followed them to the regions of peace and ble&s;&s;edne&s;s beyond the grave.</P>
<P>There are al&s;o living characters not a few, in this city, and throughout the <HI>United States,</HI> heartily engaged in the &s;ame bu&s;ine&s;s of humanity. Behold, how intent they are to do your people good!</P>
<P>You owe much likewi&s;e, to tho&s;e per&s;ons who planned &s;chools for the in&s;truction of your children. This in|&s;truction is as the <HI>door</HI> introducing the young people to the <HI>great light.</HI> Knowledge is the be&s;t foundation for in|tegrity and u&s;efulne&s;s: and it is the element and life of <HI>Freedom.</HI></P>
<P>You owe much to the "Penn&s;ylvania Society for promo|ting the abolition of &s;lavery, and the relief of free negroes unlawfully held in bondage." The memory of <HI>Franklin</HI> here ri&s;es before you. He was its Pre&s;ident. With the like views in which it originated, may it per&s;evere&mdash; till its work be completed.</P>
<P>But e&s;pecially, do you owe a large debt of gratitude to the citizens of Philadelphia, who a&s;&s;i&s;ted you by dona|tions and loans, in the building of this hand&s;ome, &s;paci|ous, and very convenient church<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dimen&s;ions&mdash;60 feet, by 40&mdash;height proportional.</NOTE>. You thought that to have an hou&s;e of your own to a&s;&s;emble in for public wor&s;hip, was, in con&s;ideration of your increa&s;ed num|bers, now de&s;irable and expedient. In the &s;ame view have your patrons and friends regarded the matter, and countenanced your proceedings. And, as with brother|ly kindne&s;s and complacency, they leave it to your&s;elves to fix upon, or adopt &s;uch &s;y&s;tem, order, and mode of wor&s;hip as may be mo&s;t agreeable to you; &s;o have they found a perfect freedom in helping you to prepare a
<PB N="20" REF="027259_0018_0FD3F33C8E019628">
place, where that &s;y&s;tem, order, and mode may peace|fully re&s;ide, and operate.</P>
<P>On the plea&s;ing ground marked out above, I <HI>could</HI> go farther,&mdash;indulging <HI>your</HI> feelings,&mdash;and <HI>my own,</HI> by particularly mentioning &s;ome characters in this place, pre|eminent for generous actions, wherever they have oppor|tunity; and who truly have been &s;o, with regard to you:&mdash;But we are re&s;trained in that &s;atisfaction. There is, however, what will be infinitely more acceptable to them; namely, to &s;ee that their acts of kindne&s;s <HI>do good.</HI></P>
<P>Mo&s;t favourably a&s;&s;i&s;ted, the pious labour of your hands hath pro&s;pered thus far; and you are now happily a&s;&s;em|bled, for the fir&s;t time, within the&s;e walls;&mdash;<HI>we</HI> offer|ing our congratulations; and cheerfully uniting with <HI>you</HI> to wor&s;hip the God of All.</P>
<P N="3">3. Another duty, is compa&s;&s;ionate love to your bre|thren, who are yet in darkne&s;s, or bondage, in other parts of the world. Be tenderly affectioned towards their condition. Pray publicly, and privately, that "the Lord may hear your voice, and look upon their affliction, and their labour, and their oppre&s;&s;ion."&mdash;</P>
<P>O mighty God! Thou do&s;t encourage us in this thing. For, notwith&s;tanding the confu&s;ion of nations, and the corruption and madne&s;s of human pa&s;&s;ions;&mdash;there is &s;ome pro&s;pect that the general cau&s;e of ju&s;tice and of freedom, and of peace on earth, will at la&s;t pre|vail!</P>
<P N="4">4. Humility is the next duty.&mdash;Remember your former condition. Pride was not made for man, in any, even the highe&s;t &s;tations in life; much le&s;s for per&s;ons who have ju&s;t emerged from the lowe&s;t. It is &s;aid, there is a great deal of this among your people, already; and that it is increa&s;ing extremely fa&s;t. I wi&s;h this might be no more than a &s;urmi&s;e: and then, that even the &s;urmi&s;e it&s;elf might be dropped; for your friends meet with di&s;|couragements on this head. Will you, my brethren, guard again&s;t pride? Will you reflect on the nature of the evil it&s;elf; the offences that come by it; and other unhappy con&s;equences!</P>
<P>It was a cu&s;tom among the Jews, as you find recorded by Mo&s;es, in the book of Deuteronomy, ch. 26.5&mdash;when the Prie&s;t received the <HI>Ba&s;ket of fir&s;t fruits</HI> from them;&mdash;
<PB N="21" REF="027259_0019_0FD3F340454503A8">
for each per&s;on to declare, in the hou&s;e and pre&s;ence of the Lord,&mdash;the hi&s;tory of the mean and wretched ori|gin of his family: "A <HI>Syrian</HI> ready to peri&s;h, was my father."</P>
<P>In like manner, when you are tempted to cheri&s;h the lea&s;t pride, in your freedom&mdash;in dre&s;s&mdash;in your favoura|ble reception among your fellow-citizens,&mdash;and even in this <HI>&s;tately building;</HI>&mdash;or in any of your civil, as well as re|ligious privileges;&mdash;then check your&s;elves, by confe&s;&s;ing privately and publicly, that "a &s;lave ready to peri&s;h was my father:" Or, if all cannot &s;ay this; you may unite in expre&s;&s;ions &s;till more humbling, and &s;ay "A &s;inner&mdash;a fallen man&mdash;a rebel again&s;t God&mdash;an heir of wrath; and, until redeemed, a child of hell, <HI>was my father.</HI>"</P>
<P N="5">5. Circum&s;pection in your conduct and intercour&s;e with the world, is another duty that you are e&s;pecially con|cerned in. "See that ye walk circum&s;pectly; not as fools, but as wife." Remember, that you have enemies, as well as friends; that you will be narrowly watched; and that le&s;s allowance will be made for your failings, than for tho&s;e of other people. This circum&s;pection will be the more nece&s;&s;ary, as you have became a religious &s;ociety.&mdash;</P>
<P>Peaceablene&s;s among your&s;elves, and with all men, is indi&s;pen&s;able to a fair character; as al&s;o truth in your dealings, in your words, and in your inner man; diligence in providing things hone&s;t: temperance and &s;obriety; an obliging, friendly, meek conver&s;ation.&mdash;</P>
<P>Here a particular thought occurs to me, which is not to be &s;uppre&s;&s;ed: With regard to tho&s;e of you who are <HI>not free,</HI>&mdash;you mu&s;t not be ca&s;t down, nor di&s;contented. It is a di&s;pen&s;ation of Providence, as I hinted already, to which you &s;hould &s;ubmit in quietne&s;s, for con&s;cience &s;ake: and in &s;o doing, you &s;hall certainly meet with good. I give you St. Paul's advice, adapted exactly to your &s;itu|ation&punc; "Let as many &s;ervants as are under the yoke, count their own ma&s;ters worthy of all honour; that the name of God, and his doctrine be not bla&s;phemed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. vi.1.</NOTE>&punc;"</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="027259_0020_0FD3F34163815718">To proceed: You have built an hou&s;e for the public wor&s;hip of God; and this day, &s;olemnly dedicated it un|to him.&mdash;</P>
<P>O may the Lord our God accept of the dedication! Let him not leave this people, nor for&s;ake them: "Hear thou in heaven, their prayers and their &s;upplications, and maintain their cau&s;e!"</P>
<P>Come then ye people, highly favoured! Your hou&s;e is <HI>Holine&s;s unto the Lord!</HI> Let none who ever wor&s;hip in it, di&s;honor it at any time, or in any way. You have here, in the mo&s;t public manner named the name of Chri&s;t, and told us, You "have &s;een his &s;tar in the ea&s;t, and are come to wor&s;hip him;"&mdash;depart then,&mdash;depart from all&mdash;yea, even from the &s;hadow of iniquity.</P>
<P>It is not a &s;mall matter, to have even heard of the true God. It is &s;till a greater to have been taught his pure religion: But, together with the above,&mdash;for <HI>you</HI> to be encouraged, in the cour&s;e of events, to build a temple to that God, wherein his name may be adored,&mdash;this is indeed <HI>an honour</HI> be&s;towed upon you. Here then, be a&s;&s;ured,&mdash;is a period in your progre&s;s and profe&s;&s;ion, which will prove very remarkable: For, according as your con|duct henceforth, turns out well or ill; your example will be a prai&s;e in the view of all around you,&mdash;or a reproach. Yes, this very hou&s;e&mdash;or rather, the conver&s;ation of tho&s;e belonging to it, "is &s;et for the fall, or ri&s;ing again of many"&mdash;of the people <HI>of your colour.</HI> On the right improvement of your pre&s;ent advantages, depends, per|haps, the fate of your brethren in bondage, in every part of the world. Strengthen the hands of your friends every where by your pure and unexceptionable conduct. This will be to "let your light &s;hine," in favour of the multitudes yet covered with darkne&s;s. This will be en|couraging the deliverance of tho&s;e who are bound.</P>
<P>A contrary behaviour will certainly increa&s;e their dark|ne&s;s, and tend only to rivet &s;till clo&s;er their chains. It may render the yet exi&s;ting reproach of our country per|petual.</P>
<P>To conclude;&mdash;Strive to e&s;cape from the darkne&s;s of &s;in. O let it not be "your condemnation, that light is come into the world, and that you have cho&s;en dark|ne&s;s rather than light, becau&s;e your deeds are evil."
<PB N="23" REF="027259_0021_0FD3F34343C6B878">
With your own eyes, behold the <HI>great light</HI> that has been de&s;cribed; and walk ye in it. Prize beyond all things the in&s;tructive, renovating grace of the go&s;pel. Reflect on the con&s;iderations now offered for that purpo&s;e. At|tend, I be&s;eech you, to the admonitions of your own con&s;ciences; to the calls of Providence; to the word of the Lord; to the teachings of the Divine Spirit; to the terrors of neglecting &s;o great a &s;alvation; to the hopes, and the joys of obtaining it;&mdash;to the &s;ure pro&s;pects of glory, honour, and immortality in the life to come.</P>
<P>Thus have we a&s;ked, O great God! for the coun&s;el, and light, and Ble&s;&s;ing which we need. Thus have we opened the&s;e doors, for thy &s;acred wor&s;hip, and to thine honour. Thus, with thy permi&s;&s;ion, have I &s;poken to this people, whom we take by the hand as <HI>Brethren</HI> in Chri&s;t Je&s;us.&mdash;Who can doubt, but thou wilt, look down from Heaven, and ca&s;t upon us the bright beams of thy mercy!</P>
<P>MY RESPECTED AUDIENCE,</P>
<P>What if now, before we part, &s;ome free-will offering &s;hould be made, in favour of this dedicated hou&s;e&mdash; Prayers never come up more acceptably before God, for a memorial, than when united with alms: And I am in|clined to believe, that there are very few occa&s;ions, if any, on which &s;uch an union could, with more propriety than the pre&s;ent, take place.</P>
<P>Under &s;ome difficulties, though highly favoured,&mdash; after con&s;iderable delay, and apprehen&s;ions, at times, of much greater;&mdash;it hath plea&s;ed Providence to permit this goodly building to be brought on to its pre&s;ent &s;tate.

citizens, a number of your benefactors,&mdash;your Fellow-Chri&s;tians al&s;o&mdash;will cheerfully go on to en|courage and a&s;&s;i&s;t you.</P>
