<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE Author of the following &s;heets is well aware of the objections which may be made to the performance; but is in hopes the candour of the publick will ex|cu&s;e tho&s;e defects, which the na|ture of the undertaking rendered it almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to avoid. The pointed &s;atire of ridicule, which would perhaps have given a ze&s;t to tho&s;e &s;cenes in which the &s;ub|ject of the&s;e pages was engaged, was not, in the opinion of the writer, at all proper for tho&s;e readers for whom it was &s;olely de|&s;igned. To exhibit their &s;uperiours
<PB N="vi" REF="021187_0004_0FB26EEE90FA1D78">
in a ridiculous view, is not the proper method to engage the youthful mind to re&s;pect. To re|pre&s;ent their equals as the objects of contemptuous mirth, is by no means favourable to the intere&s;t of good nature. And to treat the characters of their inferiours with levity, the Author thought was in|con&s;i&s;tent with the &s;acred rights of humanity. Circum&s;cribed therefore to the narrow bounda|ries of &s;imple narrative, it has been the de&s;ign of the following pages, carefully to avoid exciting any wrong impre&s;&s;ion, and, by &s;ometimes blending <HI>in&s;truction</HI> with <HI>amu&s;ement,</HI> to make it the more ea&s;ily retained.</P>
<P><PB N="vii" REF="021187_0005_0FB26EF14343B950">To multiply incidents in the&s;e circum&s;tances, was a very difficult ta&s;k, e&s;pecially, as it was wi&s;hed to make them ari&s;e naturally from the &s;ubject; and not obtrude un|nece&s;&s;arily without any &s;eeming cau&s;e to produce them. The avidity with which children pe|ru&s;e books of entertainment, is a proof how much publications pro|per for their attention are requir|ed. Though the &s;entiments &s;hould be &s;uited to their &s;implic|ity, they ought to be expre&s;&s;ed with propriety; &s;ince a ta&s;te for elegance may be in&s;en&s;ibly ac|quired; and we &s;hould always <HI>endeavour</HI> to pre&s;ent them with proper models of imitation.

the Author of the&s;e adventures would gladly have de|clined the ta&s;k, in the expectation of &s;uch a work's engaging the attention of tho&s;e, who have genius equal to its accompli&s;h|ment.

<HEAD>ADVENTURES OF A PINCUSHION.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="part">
<P>IT happened one very fine afternoon in the latter end of <HI>May,</HI> that Mrs. <HI>Airy</HI> had been collecting together a great number of different pieces of &s;ilk, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> order to make a workbag; which &s;he intended as a pre&s;ent to one of her nieces. Mi&s;s <HI>Martha Airy,</HI> her elde&s;t daughter, was about ten years old, and had been for &s;ome time indolently lolling with both her elbows on the table, to look at her Mamma while &s;he was chu&s;ing the prettie&s;t pattern for the purpo&s;e I ju&s;t mentioned. Her chin re&s;ted on her two hands, which were cro&s;&s;ed over each other, and &s;he was &s;eated on the back of her brother's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">air, which he had turned down in that manner for the purpo&s;e of &s;erving him as a hor&s;e. At la&s;t, however, her weight prov|ing too great for the &s;eat &s;he had cho&s;en, as &s;he did not keep &s;till, the upper part of the
<PB N="10" REF="021187_0008_0FB26EFA99B6FA30">
chair back came to the ground, while the other end mounted up like a piece of board for a &s;ee&s;aw; and &s;he tumbled down backwards, and in her fall proved the occa&s;ion of a great deal of mi&s;chief, by over&s;etting a curious &s;et of tea china, which her &s;i&s;ter <HI>Charlotte</HI> was playing with; and which &s;he had received as a pre&s;ent the day before from her grand papa. <HI>Charlotte</HI> was &s;o enraged at the lo&s;s of her play-things, that without offering to help her &s;i&s;ter, &s;he gave her a &s;lap on the face, and told her, &s;he was very naughty to &s;poil things in &s;uch a manner by her carele&s;&s;ne&s;s and that &s;he would break her plates whenever they came in her way. She was proceeding in this manner, when Mrs. <HI>Airy</HI> thought it time to interfere, and was extremely angry with <HI>Charlotte</HI> for her warmth. "<HI>Martha</HI> was not to blame," add|ed &s;he, "as &s;he had no intention of doing the lea&s;t mi&s;chief to your cups and &s;aucers. I think as I told her once before, &s;he was not &s;itting in a graceful attitude, and had &s;he moved at the time I &s;poke to her, it would have prevented her fall; but that is no ju&s;ti|fication of your behaviour to your &s;i&s;ter. She has not de&s;erved your reproaches, and I did not think you could have behaved &s;o improp|erly, as well as unkindly, as to &s;trike any one, e&s;pecially your elder &s;i&s;ter. Indeed I am much

di&s;plea&s;ed with you, and the threat you made of breaking her plates in return, is &s;o very naughty and wicked, that I think you de&s;erve to be puni&s;hed; and I de&s;ire you will a&s;k <HI>Mar|tha's</HI> pardon for the blow you have given her." <HI>Charlotte</HI> coloured with indignation and anger, at the thoughts of &s;ubmitting in &s;uch a man|ner to humble her&s;elf. She had heard &s;ome &s;illy girls declare, they would never confe&s;s to be wrong, and was withheld from acting in the noble&s;t manner, by the fal&s;e &s;hame of con|fe&s;&s;ing an errour. At length, however, upon her Mamma's coming towards her with an <FIGURE>

intention of inflicting &s;ome farther puni&s;hment, &s;he mumbled out, in a low voice, which was very difficult to be under&s;tood, That &s;he was very &s;orry &s;he had &s;truck her. <HI>Martha,</HI> who was extremely generous, and uncommonly good natured, very affectionately ki&s;&s;ed her &s;i&s;ter; and told her, &s;he was much concerned at the mi&s;chief &s;he had occa&s;ioned; though &s;he could not have helped it, as &s;he fell down before &s;he was aware of it, and did not &s;ee that her tea things were near her. <HI>Charlotte</HI> grew reconciled by degrees; but it was a long time before &s;he regained her u&s;ual cheerfulne&s;s. After &s;ome time, however, the &s;i&s;ters &s;eated them&s;elves in a window by the table, and &s;o|licited their Mamma for a bit of &s;ilk to make a <HI>Pincu&s;hion.</HI> Mrs. <HI>Airy</HI> gave them &s;everal pieces to chu&s;e which they liked be&s;t; and after they had taken them up a dozen times, or perhaps as many more, had they been reckon|ed, <HI>Martha</HI> made choice of a &s;quare piece of pink &s;attin, which &s;he neatly &s;ewed and &s;tuffed with bran, and which, gentle reader, when it was fini&s;hed, was the identical <HI>Pincu&s;hion</HI> who&s;e adventures form the &s;ubject of this little volume. A&s;&s;uming, therefore, the title of an Hi&s;torian, or Biographer, which is generally under&s;tood to mean a per&s;on who is writing an account of his own, or another's actions, I
<PB N="13" REF="021187_0011_0FB26ADFD3E15B00">
&s;hall take the liberty to &s;peak for my&s;elf, and tell you what I &s;aw and heard in the character of a <HI>Pincu&s;hion.</HI> Perhaps you never thought that &s;uch things as are inanimate, could be &s;en&s;ible of any thing which happens, as they can neither hear, &s;ee, or under&s;tand; and as I would not willingly mi&s;lead your judgment. I would, previous to your reading this work, inform you, that it is to be under&s;tood as an imaginary tale, in the &s;ame manner as when you are at play, you &s;ometimes call your&s;elves gentlemen, and ladies, though you know you are only little boys, or girls. So, when you read of birds and bea&s;ts &s;peaking and thinking, you know it is not &s;o in reality, any more than your amu&s;ements, which you frequently call <HI>making believe.</HI> To u&s;e your own &s;tile, and adopt your own manner of &s;peaking, therefore, you mu&s;t imagine that a <HI>Pincu&s;hion</HI> is now <HI>making believe</HI> to addre&s;s you, and to recite a number of little events, &s;ome of which really have happened, and others might do &s;o with great probability; and if any of the characters here repre&s;ented &s;hould appear to be di&s;agree|able, the Author hopes you will endeavour to avoid their failings, and to practi&s;e tho&s;e vir|tues or accompli&s;hments, which render the con|trary examples more worthy of imitation. And now, if you plea&s;e, we will return to the

account of what farther befel me in the family of Mrs. <HI>Airy.</HI></P>
<P>After the young ladies had amu&s;ed them|&s;elves a great while with the pieces of &s;ilk <FIGURE>
</FIGURE> I have &s;o often had occa&s;ion to mention, and Mi&s;s <HI>Martha</HI> had completed me to her entire &s;atisfaction; &s;he took all the pins out of an old green one, which was originally in the &s;hape of an heart, but had, by loo&s;ing a great part of its in&s;ide, through various little holes, quite lo&s;t its form; and which, that &s;he might find tho&s;e pins which had gone through the
<PB N="15" REF="021187_0013_0FB26AE530ECFE70">
&s;ilk, &s;he cut open the old pincu&s;hion, and then &s;tuck all &s;he could find upon my &s;ides in the &s;hape of letters, which &s;he afterwards changed to flowers, and a third time altered to &s;tars and circles; which afforded her full amu&s;ement until bedtime. Mi&s;s <HI>Charlotte,</HI> though her Mamma had given her as much &s;ilk as her &s;i&s;ter, had only cut it to wa&s;te; while <FIGURE>
</FIGURE><HI>Martha,</HI> after &s;he had fini&s;hed me, had &s;aved the re&s;t towards making a hou&s;e wife for her doll. I could not help reflecting when I &s;aw all <HI>Charlotte's</HI> little &s;hreads and &s;lips littering the room; what a &s;imple method may little

girls are apt to get into, of wa&s;ting every thing which their friends are &s;o kind as to give them, and which, properly employed, might make them many u&s;eful ornaments for their dolls; and &s;ometimes pretty trifles for them&s;elves. <HI>Charlotte Airy,</HI> as &s;uch children u&s;ually are, was de&s;irous of having every thing &s;he &s;aw, &s;o that her drawers were always filled with bits of ribbon, pieces of &s;ilk, cuttings of gauze, catgut, and mu&s;lin; that if &s;he wanted to find her gloves, tippet, tuckers, or any part of her dre&s;s, &s;he was obliged to &s;earch for them in twenty different places, and frequently to go without what &s;he was looking for. <HI>Martha,</HI> on the contrary, by taking care of what might be of u&s;e, and laying it by in a proper place, always knew where to find what &s;he had occa|&s;ion for directly. So that it frequently hap|pened that &s;he went out with her Mamma, when her &s;i&s;ter was forced to &s;tay at home, be|cau&s;e &s;he had lo&s;t &s;omething which had delayed her &s;o long to look for, that &s;he could not get ready in time. This very circum&s;tance hap|pened the day after I became acquainted with her, to her no &s;mall mortification. Mrs. <HI>Airy</HI> was going to &s;ee the exhibition of pictures, at the Royal <HI>Academy,</HI> and told her daughters if they behaved well, they &s;hould accompany her; as Mrs. <HI>Gardner</HI> and her niece Mi&s;s <HI>Lounge,</HI>
<PB N="17" REF="021187_0015_0FB26AF22F04C228">
would call at one o'clock. After breakfa&s;t, <HI>Charlotte,</HI> who had found the mould of an old button in one of her papa's wai&s;tcoat pockets which &s;he had been rummaging, and had cut to pieces an axletree of a little cart, which belonged to her brother, to make a &s;pindle, in order to convert it into a teatotum; with which &s;he was &s;o much entertained, that &s;he was very unwilling to leave it to go to work, though her mamma repeatedly told her, &s;he would not be ready again&s;t Mr. <HI>Gardner's</HI> coach came. "Yes I &s;hall, Ma'am!" &s;aid &s;he, and played on. "Do pray go to work, <HI>Charlotte!"</HI> <FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="18" REF="021187_0016_0FB26AF6422B8AC0">"Pre&s;ently, Ma'am." But &s;till &s;he thought &s;he would give it another twirl. "You &s;hall not go if you have not fini&s;hed your morning bu&s;ine&s;s!" "In a minute I will!" And &s;o &s;he &s;imply idled away her time, without heeding her mamma's admonition, until near an hour beyond her u&s;ual time of beginning. This put her into &s;uch a hurry to fini&s;h, when &s;he found it was &s;o late, that &s;he &s;titched &s;ome wri&s;tbands &s;he was about, and which were intended for her grandpapa, &s;o very bad, they were obliged to be undone; and that made her &s;o cro&s;s, that in pulling out the work, &s;he broke the threads of the cloth, which entirely &s;poiled it. <HI>Char|lotte</HI> was a very fair complexioned pretty girl; but you cannot imagine how ugly her ill hu|mour made her appear; nor how much more agreeable her &s;i&s;ter looked, who was much browner, was pitted with the &s;mall pox, and a much plainer child. I &s;urveyed them both as I lay on the table, where my Mi&s;tre&s;s had placed me to &s;tick her pins in as &s;he took them out of a &s;hirt collar which &s;he was putting on, <HI>Martha</HI> looked &s;o placid and cheerful, and &s;eemed to &s;peak &s;o kindly when &s;he a&s;ked a que&s;tion, that it made her really charming; while <HI>Charlotte,</HI> who had a very pretty mouth, and very regular features, &s;tuck out her lips in a manner &s;o unbecoming, and to&s;&s;ed about
<PB N="19" REF="021187_0017_0FB26AF719CA6AC0">
her head with &s;uch very illiberal jerks, that &s;he lo&s;t all her natural advantages in her wilful ill humour. A per&s;on happening to call on Mrs. <HI>Airy,</HI> to &s;peak about &s;ome particular bu|&s;ine&s;s, &s;he left the children to attend him; and <HI>Martha,</HI> who pitied her &s;i&s;ter's di&s;tre&s;s, and &s;aw the impo&s;&s;ibility of her fini&s;hing the ta&s;k &s;he was ordered to do, very kindly offered to a&s;&s;i&s;t her, without which, &s;he never could have ac|compli&s;hed it. But their Mamma at her return, immediately &s;u&s;pected the ca&s;e to be as I have told you, and enquired what help <HI>Charlotte</HI> had had in her ab&s;ence? They were both girls of too much honour to deny the truth, and in con|&s;equence of her frankly owning her &s;i&s;ter's kindne&s;s, Mrs. <HI>Airy</HI> permitted her to retire, in order to prepare for the intended expedition. But, alas! poor <HI>Charlotte,</HI> who indeed was not always &s;o good as &s;he ought to have been, was not to go that morning, although her Mamma had con&s;ented to it. <HI>Betty,</HI> who came to put on her &s;rock, was not very fond of her, for &s;he was &s;ometimes apt, when her Mamma was not in the way, to &s;peak very haughtily, and in a manner quite unbecoming a young lady. Unfortunately &s;he forgot her&s;elf on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, and very rudely &s;aid, "You mu&s;t come and dre&s;s me, and you mu&s;t make ha&s;te, or I &s;hall not be ready." <HI>Mu&s;t I?</HI> replied <HI>Betty,</HI>
<PB N="20" REF="021187_0018_0FB26AF8C1BEA7C0"><FIGURE>
</FIGURE> That is, if <HI>I plea&s;e,</HI> Mi&s;s <HI>Charlotte,</HI> though you forgot to put that in, and unle&s;s you &s;peak in a prettier way, I will not help you at all. "Then you may let it alone, for I won't a&s;k you any otherwi&s;e," and away &s;he went, hang|ing the door after her, to call her &s;i&s;ter, who was ready and waiting for the coach in her Mamma's room. <HI>Martha</HI> ran directly, and began to pin her &s;rock as &s;he de&s;ired. But a new di&s;tre&s;s aro&s;e, for as &s;he was too carele&s;s ever to retain any of my fellow &s;ervants (com|monly called a <HI>Pinchu&s;hion</HI>) in her &s;ervice, &s;o &s;he had not one pin to proceed with after three;
<PB N="21" REF="021187_0019_0FB26AFEDFD17E18">
which had &s;tuck at one end of me, had been employed. Neither of them cho&s;e to apply to <HI>Betty,</HI> becau&s;e they were &s;ure from <HI>Charlotte</HI>'s ill behaviour to be denied; and &s;he would not permit her &s;i&s;ter to a&s;k her Mamma, for fear of an enquiry which might not turn out to her credit. So, in &s;hort, they both traver&s;ed the room backwards and forwards, and were quite overjoyed when they found two (one of which proved to be crooked) between the joining of the floor. Then they each returned and took me up repeatedly, and examined me over and over, though they were convinced I had been empty long ago. At la&s;t, a loud rap at the door announced Mrs. <HI>Gardner</HI>'s arrival. The ladies were called, and <HI>Martha</HI> obeyed, though with reluctance to leave her &s;i&s;ter; and <HI>Char|lotte,</HI> with con&s;cious &s;hame, and remor&s;e for her pa&s;t conduct, and heart heaving &s;obs of di&s;appointment, &s;aw them drive away with|out her. I was left upon the table in the hurry of my mi&s;tre&s;s's departure, and <HI>Charlotte</HI> took me up, and earne&s;tly wi&s;hed &s;he had had a pincu&s;hion of her own: and &s;o I &s;hould think would any one, who had experienced the want of &s;uch a u&s;eful companion; though unle&s;s it is well furni&s;hed with pins, it is in it&s;elf but of little a&s;&s;i&s;tance, as &s;he had but too fatally found. The &s;latternly appearance, and real inconve|nience,
<PB N="22" REF="021187_0020_0FB26B02EFBA4300"><FIGURE>
</FIGURE> which many ladies &s;uffer from a neglect to provide them&s;elves with, and to retain a few &s;uch nece&s;&s;ary implements of female eco|nomy about them, is really inconceivable by any per&s;on who is accu&s;tomed to a proper de|gree of attention. <HI>Trifles</HI> are frequently re|garded by the giddy and thoughtle&s;s as of no moment, when <HI>e&s;&s;entials</HI> are taken care of; but it is the repetition of <HI>trifles</HI> which con&s;titutes the chief bu&s;ine&s;s of our exi&s;tence. In other words, people form their opinion of a young lady from her per&s;onal appearance; and if, becau&s;e &s;he is at work, and in want of pins,
<PB N="23" REF="021187_0021_0FB26B059E367F40">
and de&s;titute of a <HI>Pincu&s;hion,</HI> &s;he has quite un|dre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf, and her clothes are dropping off, &s;he will be thought a negligent &s;lattern; which, I &s;uppo&s;e, is what no one would chu&s;e to be e&s;teemed. So, when children accu&s;tom them&s;elves to loll their elbows, &s;toop their heads, &s;tand upon one foot, bite their nails, or any other ungraceful actions, it makes them di&s;a|greeable, and the objects of di&s;like to all their friends, and every one who is acquainted with them. And it is very fooli&s;h to imagine, that becau&s;e they are not in company with <HI>&s;trangers</HI> it does not &s;ignify; for ill habits, when once they are acquired, are very difficult to leave off; and by being u&s;ed to do an unpolite ac|tion, frequently they will do it without recol|lecting the impropriety, when if they thought, perhaps, they would have on no account been guilty of it. Mi&s;s <HI>Lounge,</HI> the young lady who accompanied Mrs. <HI>Airy</HI> to the exhibition, was a &s;triking example of what I mentioned above. She was about &s;ixteen, and very tall of her age; &s;o that &s;he appeared quite womanly in per&s;on, though her manners were to the highe&s;t degree u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">genteel. Her method of walking was re|markably unplea&s;ing. She had a &s;trange way of to&s;&s;ing her legs round at every &s;tep, as if &s;he was making circles. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> her arms were cro&s;&s;ed over each other <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> awkward a manner, and

&s;o unfa&s;hionably low, that it made her &s;till more ungraceful in her appearance; be&s;ides this, &s;he had acquired a drawling tone in conver&s;a|tion, which made her completely an object of di&s;gu&s;t; as it was entirely the con&s;equence of her own neglect, and therefore, was by no means de&s;erving of that pity which is due to every natural defect, or accidental deformity. She returned with her aunt to dinner; and Mi&s;s <HI>Charlotte</HI> was quite a&s;hamed of entering the drawing room, though &s;he was now dre&s;&s;ed, and had promi&s;ed Mrs. <HI>Betty</HI> &s;he would behave with more civility for the future.

She did not venture down &s;tairs, therefore, until dinner was on the table; and then, with her neck and face as red as blu&s;hes could make them, &s;he paid her compliments to the company, without daring to look at her Mamma.

Earl <HI>Goodwin.</HI> She replied, that Mrs. <HI>Gardner</HI> had pointed it out to her ob&s;ervation; but that &s;he had not remarked any particulars, except the figure of a King, and a large company at dinner. I will tell you the &s;tory then, my dear, to which that picture refers.</P>
<P>In the reign of <HI>Edward</HI> the confe&s;&s;or, in the year 1042, Earl <HI>Goodwin,</HI> who had been acce&s;|&s;ary to the murder of Prince <HI>Alfred,</HI> was at dinner with the King at <HI>Wind&s;or</HI>; and taking a piece of bread, called God to witne&s;s his in|nocence, and wi&s;hed if he uttered any thing but the truth, that the next mouthful he eat might choke him. Which accordingly happened, and the bread &s;tuck in his throat and he died immediately at the table. Don't you think, my dear, added Mrs. <HI>Airy,</HI> it was a ju&s;t puni&s;h|ment for his untruth; and an awful judgment for calling God to witne&s;s to a fal&s;ehood? In|deed, Ma'am, I think it was quite dreadful; but are you &s;ure that this account is true? for though it is certainly very wicked to tell a lye on any occa&s;ion, yet, as &s;ometimes many peo|ple are thus guilty, I wonder that &s;uch events do not more frequently happen! You know that Mi&s;s <HI>Ryeby</HI> &s;aid &s;he had not been writing la&s;t week, although you &s;aw that her fingers were inked; and <HI>Charlotte</HI> had &s;een her doing it; why then, did not the &s;ame accident hap|pen
<PB N="31" REF="021187_0029_0FB26B240B3EC0F0">
to her? "Becau&s;e, my love, the puni&s;h|ment of &s;uch crimes do not always immediately follow the commi&s;&s;ion of them; but you may be &s;ure that the remor&s;e of con&s;cience, and the &s;ecret unea&s;ine&s;s of mind which the guilty &s;uf|fer, is a very great unhappine&s;s, and the ap|prehen&s;ion and the fear of a future account after death, be&s;ides the idea of pre&s;ent detec|tion, is &s;uch a degree of mi&s;ery as no other puni&s;hment can equal. As to your que&s;tion, whether I believe this account to be true? I certainly do! It was an extraordinary event which was recorded at the time it happened, and which every hi&s;torian has mentioned &s;ince, and faithfully tran&s;mitted to us. This is the be&s;t authority we can have for any fact which happened before our own time, and therefore entitled to our belief. But why &s;uch exam|ples are &s;o rare, is not to be wondered at; be|cau&s;e you know that wicked people will be puni&s;hed hereafter; and though &s;uch in&s;tances &s;ometimes happen to teach others to be good, and to make them afraid of doing what will make them liable to &s;uch terrible vengeance, yet, in general, a crime of this kind does not meet with immediate cha&s;ti&s;ement; becau&s;e, after death, as I have before told you, tho&s;e who have been wicked, will &s;uffer &s;uch mi&s;ery as their &s;ins de&s;erved. Be&s;ides which, the liar

is at pre&s;ent dete&s;ted by every one, and lo&s;es all the advantage of confidence, and the plea|&s;ure of being believed: Even when he does &s;peak truth, he is liable to be &s;u&s;pected, and his word is doubted on all occa&s;ions." The conver&s;ation was here interrupted by the arri|val of two young ladies with their Mamma, who came to pay a morning vi&s;it to Mrs. <HI>Airy</HI>; but as they did not &s;ay any thing worth the attention of my readers, I &s;hall not trouble my&s;elf to repeat more of what pa&s;&s;ed than may be imagined, from the comments of my mi&s;tre&s;s and her &s;i&s;ter, with which I &s;hall pre&s;ent them.</P>
<P><HI>Martha,</HI> before the room door was well &s;hut after them, began to ob&s;erve that the elde&s;t Mi&s;s <HI>Chantillon</HI> was very ugly, and very &s;tupid; and the younge&s;t a good pretty girl, and talked a great deal, indeed. I wi&s;h, added &s;he, I could &s;peak as fa&s;t as &s;he does. To talk &s;o fa&s;t, my love, &s;aid her Mamma, is by no means any accompli&s;hment; and I am far from your opi|nion, in &s;o highly admiring the merits of Mi&s;s <HI>Lucy.</HI> She chatters &s;o quick, as frequently not to be under&s;tood; and has a very &s;illy trick of beginning every &s;entence with a laugh, than which nothing can be more illbred. The per&s;on who is &s;peaking, &s;hould never laugh, if &s;he can help it, at her own wit, if &s;he de&s;igns to excite mirth, or to meet with approbation
<PB N="33" REF="021187_0031_0FB26B265DD18798"><FIGURE>
</FIGURE> from others. But without any &s;uch intention, <HI>Lucy</HI> a&s;&s;umes an affected giggle whenever &s;he attempts to &s;peak. She has likewi&s;e a very unbecoming pertne&s;s in her manner, and by fre|quent interruptions when her elders are other|wi&s;e engaged, renders her&s;elf extremely di&s;a|greeable. I would have you, my good girls, po&s;&s;e&s;s that de&s;irable degree of proper courage, as never to feel a&s;hamed of &s;peaking when it is nece&s;&s;ary; but I think it is an unplea&s;ing &s;ight to perceive a young woman, or child I &s;hould &s;ay, for <HI>Lucy</HI> is young enough for that epithet, affecting to under&s;tand every thing, and giving
<PB N="34" REF="021187_0032_0FB26B2D8B0C1830">
her opinion una&s;ked, upon &s;ubjects, which fre|quently expo&s;e her ignorance and pre&s;umption. This is aiming at a character to which &s;he has no preten&s;ions; and by wi&s;hing to ri&s;e into a woman before &s;he has reached the age of un|der&s;tanding, &s;he is de&s;pi&s;ed for her vanity, and lo&s;es that e&s;teem &s;he might have attained by a proper degree of humility, and a better know|ledge of her &s;tation. This ob&s;ervation, my dear <HI>Martha,</HI> I would particularly addre&s;s to you; as you are generally thought uncommonly tall, and are u&s;ually imagined to be much older than you are. This I know you fancy to be a compliment, which always appears to give you plea&s;ure; but remember, that, if you a&s;&s;ume airs of womanhood, and affect to be thought farther advanced in age, you will have the le&s;s allowance made for any errours you may com|mit, and con&s;equently meet with contempt where you might otherwi&s;e have e&s;caped cen&s;ure. Youth, and inexperience, are ju&s;tly al|lowed to excu&s;e any &s;light inadvertence in man|ners, or want of grace in appearance; but if you chu&s;e to be thought of more con&s;equence, you mu&s;t likewi&s;e expect, that the notice you may attract will not always be favourable to your vanity. I a&s;&s;ure you, I think Mi&s;s <HI>Jenny Chantillon</HI> is much more agreeable than her &s;i&s;ter, as &s;he has courage &s;ufficient to reply to
<PB N="35" REF="021187_0033_0FB26B30EC33E330">
any que&s;tion, and to &s;peak di&s;tinctly when &s;he is particularly addre&s;&s;ed, without enquiring in <HI>Lucy</HI>'s manner, into the rea&s;on of every word which is uttered, and deciding every ar|gument according to her own fancy: and, I dare &s;ay, if you will be careful to ob&s;erve, you will find that <HI>Jenny</HI> always meets with attention from the company, while <HI>Lucy</HI> is frequently in|&s;ulted, by being enjoined to &s;ilence, and by her hearers turning from her with di&s;dain. In &s;hort, my dear, it requires a great deal of thought and propriety, to behave in an agreeable manner, at your age. It is be&s;t not to be anxious to be taken notice of, &s;ince that eagerne&s;s always defeats its aim. Girls have not had the ad|vantage of experience to teach them wi&s;dom; and when once they are engaged in conver&s;a|tion, and find them&s;elves attended to, their volatile &s;pirits hurry them on, with the de&s;ire of obtaining applau&s;e for their wit, to &s;ay things which are &s;ometimes neither delicate or prudent; and which they may, when they have time to reflect, long have rea&s;on to repent having im|prudently uttered. Any re&s;traint at &s;uch a time, is, I know, always e&s;teemed an ill na|tured interruption, and is apt to damp their harmony, and lower their &s;pirits. I would therefore warn you of the danger before hand, that your own prudence may be a check to
<PB N="36" REF="021187_0034_0FB26B39307238C0">
that unlimited indulgence, which at &s;uch a period is liable to exce&s;s: and, I dare &s;ay, that your good &s;en&s;e will teach you, that my admo|nitions are always intended for your advantage. To impre&s;s this deeper upon your mind, I will repeat to you a few lines which were wrote to me, when I was young, by my aunt, and which, as they frequently occurred to my me|mory, I found to be &s;ingularly u&s;eful.<FIGURE>

<PB N="39" REF="021187_0037_0FB26B4447138218">
gave me into her hand in a hurry, while &s;he was looking for her cloak. So without recol|lecting that I was another's property, <HI>Eliza,</HI> put me into her pocket, made a very elegant courte&s;y, and &s;tept into the carriage. I felt really very &s;orry to part from a family with which I had been &s;ome time connected; and to one of whom I owed my being a <HI>Pincu&s;hion.</HI> But my new mi&s;tre&s;s was &s;o very engaging, that I was in hopes &s;he would take care of me, and not leave me about to the mercy of a little kitten, who jumped into her lap the moment &s;he got home; and who afterwards fri&s;ked away with a little ta&s;&s;el which dropped off from one corner of a work bag which lay on the table. But before I proceed with my hi&s;tory, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to introduce my readers to Mi&s;s <HI>Meekly</HI> and her companions, and to make them better acquainted with this new family, who are all of them de&s;erving their notice.</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Stanley,</HI> to whom the hou&s;e belonged, was the widow of a clergyman, who had at his death left her in rather indigent circum|&s;tances; and &s;he had been advi&s;ed (to &s;upport her&s;elf and two younger &s;i&s;ters who lived with her) to take a &s;mall number of young ladies to board. Her number was confined to &s;ix; of whom two were tho&s;e I have above men|tioned. The others were three &s;i&s;ters, who&s;e
<PB N="40" REF="021187_0038_0FB26B4DAB274590">
names were <HI>Saxby,</HI> and a Mi&s;s <HI>Una</HI>; who, for her &s;weetne&s;s of temper, and excellence in every accompli&s;hment, was e&s;teemed &s;uperiour to all the re&s;t of her companions. <HI>Harriet Una,</HI> was cou&s;in to Mi&s;s <HI>Meekly,</HI> and they u&s;ually &s;lept together. She was ju&s;t turned of thirteen, was tall and large; had light brown hair, blue eyes, and a fine complexion: But her good-nature, and willingne&s;s to oblige every one, made her the general favourite, and recom|mended her to univer&s;al e&s;teem.</P>
<P>When the young ladies retired to bed, <HI>Eliza</HI> found me in her pocket, and told <HI>Harriet,</HI> &s;he was afraid Mi&s;s <HI>Airy</HI> would want her <HI>Pincu&s;hion</HI>; and &s;he was more concerned, as the family were to go into the country very early the next morning, and &s;he &s;hould have no oppor|tunity to return it. However, continued &s;he, I will make a new one to pre&s;ent Mi&s;s <HI>Airy</HI> with, when I &s;ee her; and I will keep this, as I have not one at pre&s;ent, my kitten having pulled mine to pieces this morning; but I will take care this &s;hall not come to the &s;ame mi&s;|chance. I was glad to hear that was her in|tention, as I &s;hould by no means have liked the thoughts of &s;haring the fate of my predece&s;&s;or.

At this time Mrs. <HI>Stanley</HI> entered the room to wi&s;h them a good night, and to &s;ee if they were properly taken care of.

her Mamma, and which came from <HI>Portugal.</HI> They were very &s;weet and lu&s;cious, and as I am not allowed to have any thing of that kind, I refu&s;ed her offer. But when we had dined, &s;he pre&s;&s;ed me again, and laughed at me &s;o much for being &s;o fooli&s;h, as to imagine any thing &s;o innocent could hurt me; but that &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed, as I went to <HI>&s;chool,</HI> my <HI>mi&s;tre&s;s,</HI> for &s;o &s;he &s;neeringly called Mrs. <HI>Stanley,</HI> would <HI>whip</HI> me if I did. That at la&s;t, overcome with her per&s;ecutions, and vexed to be treated &s;o much like a baby, and as if I was afraid of pun|i&s;hment, I took the plum, and have not been ea&s;y &s;ince. And now, my dear <HI>Harriet,</HI> what &s;hall I do?

<P><HI>Eliza</HI> was convinced of the propriety and ju&s;tice of her friend's advice, and promi&s;ed to comply with it the next morning. But her ex|ce&s;&s;ive timidity prevented her making u&s;e of &s;everal opportunities which pre&s;ented, though the &s;ubject occupied all her attention, and &s;he could &s;carce think of any thing el&s;e. She again applied therefore to <HI>Harriet,</HI> and told her it was impo&s;&s;ible for her to &s;ummon up courage to do as &s;he had de&s;ired; and begged &s;he would, from her, acquaint Mrs. <HI>Stanley</HI> with what had happened. Mi&s;s <HI>Una,</HI> in the milde&s;t terms, complied with her reque&s;t; and at the &s;ame time very generou&s;ly commending her honour on every occa&s;ion, and urging her pre&s;ent un|ea&s;ine&s;s to engage Mrs. <HI>Stanley's</HI> compa&s;&s;ion. Mi&s;s <HI>Meekly,</HI> when &s;he was acquainted with her cou&s;in's having revealed this &s;ecret, which had oppre&s;&s;ed her mind, was very unwilling to attend her to the lady abovementioned.

<P>A young lady who&s;e real name I &s;hall (for the &s;ake of charity) conceal under that of <HI>Lloyd,</HI> and who was, my dear <HI>Eliza,</HI> nearly of the &s;ame age with your&s;elf, was educated with the utmo&s;t attention; and as &s;he was an only child, was the darling of her parents, and the centre of all their future expectations. <HI>Bet&s;ey,</HI> which was her u&s;ual appellation, went one day to vi&s;it a companion, with whom &s;he was ex|tremely intimate; but who, unfortunately for her, was not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of that &s;trict honour which <FIGURE>

&s;hould ever be the ba&s;is and foundation of friend&s;hip. When they had been for &s;ome time at play in the garden, &s;he propo&s;ed to go to a little &s;hop in the neighbourhood to make a purcha&s;e of &s;ome gingerbread; and though Mi&s;s <HI>Lloyd</HI> for a time objected to the propo&s;al without leave, again&s;t her mamma's repeated command; yet, her companion's laughing at her &s;queami&s;hne&s;s (as &s;he wickedly called an adherence to her duty) prevailed over her better re&s;olutions, and &s;he accompanied her to the place I mentioned. As it was the only &s;hop of the kind which the village afforded, the boys of an adjacent &s;chool very frequently went there for the &s;ame purpo&s;e, as the two young ladies who now entered; and two of the mo&s;t unlucky of their number, happened at that time to be bargaining for &s;ome ball<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&punc; They &s;taid very &s;oberly until Mi&s;s <HI>Lloyd</HI> had taken out her pur&s;e to pay for the cakes &s;he had pur|cha&s;ed; but as the lock of her pocket book was entangled in it, it came out of her pocket at the &s;ame time, when one of the boys &s;natch|ed it from her hand, and rudely declared he would &s;ee its contents, and know all the girl's &s;ecrets. This vexed her extremely, and &s;he thoughtle&s;sly pur&s;ued him, as he ran away with the prize, until &s;he was a good way from home. He was joined by &s;everal of his &s;chool-fellows,

who took part with him, and behaved in &s;o wild a ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">er as to terrify her greatly. At length, however, &s;he got away from them, and ran back with all the &s;peed in her power; but as it was later than her u&s;ual time of re|turning, her parents were unea&s;y, and que&s;tion|ed her with great tenderne&s;s and anxiety, as to the rea&s;on of her &s;tay. She told them, &s;he had been out with Mi&s;s <HI>Hannah</HI> (the compan|ion &s;he had really vi&s;ited) and her maid, and that a hor&s;e had been near running over her, which had frightened her &s;o much, as to pre|vent her return.</P>
<P>This &s;tory was believed by Mr. and Mrs. <HI>Lloyd</HI> for &s;ome time, and <HI>Bet&s;ey</HI> who had at fir&s;t been very unhappy at the thoughts of &s;uch a wicked deceit, at length grew reconciled as &s;he found her&s;elf undetected. She there|fore ventured upon a &s;econd tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, from the encouragement which &s;he fooli&s;hly imag|ined the &s;ecre&s;y her fir&s;t fault had given her; and with her intimate Mi&s;s <HI>Hannah</HI> took another walk, without any per&s;on to have the care of them. But during their ab&s;ence from home, an unexpected accident puni&s;hed the imprudent Mi&s;s <HI>Lloyd</HI> for her di&s;obedience and untruth, in a manner which will give her cau&s;e for re|pentence to the late&s;t period of her life; for as &s;he was cro&s;&s;ing a road in her return, a hor&s;e

it was more difficult to &s;upport, than any bo|dily unea&s;ine&s;s &s;he had &s;uffered; and the re|flections that they would never be able to con|fide in her for the future, was the occa&s;ion of &s;o much &s;elf reproach as to deprive her of every enjoyment. This in&s;tance may &s;erve to convince you, that a &s;light errour is very fre|quently without any previous intention, and when lea&s;t expected; &s;uch crimes &s;eldom occur in the cooler moments of thought (that is, when you have time to reflect on the wicked|ne&s;s of the action you will never be capable of committing it) and as no per&s;on can be &s;ure they would be able to re&s;i&s;t temptation, it is be&s;t never to do any thing which you know to be wrong, though it may appear to be in the &s;malle&s;t in&s;tance, &s;ince the de&s;ire of conceal|ing a <HI>trifling</HI> fault, may lead you to hide it by a fal&s;hood, which is one of the <HI>greate&s;t</HI> you can be guilty of.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s <HI>Meekly</HI> was convinced of the truth and propriety of this argument, and promi&s;ed to be more attentive for her future conduct. She then joined her companions with that cheerful good humour, which di&s;tingui&s;hed her charac|ter, and attended them into the great parlour, where they u&s;ually &s;pent the morning.

In&s;tances of this kind very frequently occurred, and &s;up|plied them with &s;ubjects of conver&s;ation.

divided into &s;hires and counties. Mrs. <HI>Stan|ley</HI> applied to the young ladies to know if any of them could re&s;olve the que&s;tion, but as they were all &s;ilent, "You &s;hould endeavour, my dears, &s;aid &s;he, to remember what you read, or it will be of very little advantage.

<HEAD>THE ADVENTURES OF A PINCUSHION.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">PART II.</HEAD>
<P>I HAD lain &s;o long in my di&s;mal confinement, that I began to de&s;pair of ever pre&s;enting the world with any &s;econd part of my adven|tures. And yet, thought I, it is very hard that a <HI>Pincu&s;hion</HI> &s;o new, &s;o clean, and &s;o beau|tiful, that might have a thou&s;and opportuni|ties of &s;eeing the different manners of man|kind, &s;hould be thus &s;ecluded from company, and condemned by the playful freaks of an in|&s;ignificant kitten thus to pa&s;s away its be&s;t days in ob&s;curity. And here let me take this opportunity to &s;ugge&s;t a u&s;eful hint to my young readers, which, as my inactive &s;itua|tion allowed me &s;ufficient time for reflection, I had frequently rea&s;on to feel the force of;
<PB N="57" REF="021187_0055_0FB26B7D54FE0DD0"><FIGURE>
</FIGURE> namely, That although I fretted and fumed every day at my unfortunate condition, I never found it was at all improved by it, or that my ill humour in the lea&s;t degree made me happier, or a&s;&s;i&s;ted my e&s;cape.</P>
<P>When I determined to &s;ubmit quietly, I was as happy as any <HI>Pincu&s;hion</HI> in &s;uch a &s;tate of retirement could be. But when in a cro&s;s fit I tried to roll my&s;elf from under the bookca&s;e, I found the attempt was impo&s;&s;ible to accom|pli&s;h, and I hurt my &s;ides again&s;t the foot of it. The &s;pace was &s;o &s;mall between the bot|tom of my pri&s;on and the floor; that, I had no
<PB N="58" REF="021187_0056_0FB26B7FD82F0A40">
hopes of e&s;cape, as it was impo&s;&s;ible for any broom to find its way under; or otherwi&s;e the cleanline&s;s of Mrs. <HI>Stanley's</HI> maid would cer|tainly have effected my deliverance. But, alas! of this I had no pro&s;pect; and though my endeavours were fruitle&s;s, it taught me &s;uch a le&s;&s;on of contentment, as I wi&s;h every little reader of my memoirs, may remember, and copy in their own conduct. For if they are tired of working, reading, mu&s;ick, drawing, or any other employment at home; or what is frequently the ca&s;e, are impatient of the con|finement and di&s;agreeable circum&s;tances of be|ing at &s;chool, I would have them take my ad|vice, and try to amu&s;e them&s;elves when they have opportunity, and wait with patience until they are of a proper age, either to leave the place they di&s;like, or have overcome the diffi|culty of learning tho&s;e accompli&s;hments which are necce&s;&s;ary to be acquired. For they may depend upon it, that fretfulne&s;s and ill hu|mour will make every condition unhappy; while a re&s;olution to be plea&s;ed, and make the be&s;t of every thing, is the only method to be agreeable to others, or comfortable them&s;elves. The foot of the bookca&s;e will pre&s;s the clo&s;er, when we petulantly try to e&s;cape; and though <HI>children</HI> are not <HI>Pincu&s;hions,</HI> yet they will find, that whenever they are fretful and di&s;&s;atisfied,
<PB N="59" REF="021187_0057_0FB26B81D1673340">
they will be unhappy, and never &s;ucceed in any thing they undertake. I hope I &s;hall be par|doned for this digre&s;&s;ion, but as the event of my e&s;cape was &s;o &s;trong in my mind, I could not pa&s;s it by without a pau&s;e of ob&s;ervation. Let me now, however, proceed to inform my readers, that one fine day, when I had deter|mined to make my&s;elf contented, and when from the quietne&s;s in which I had been for &s;ome days, I had rea&s;on to believe the family were ab&s;ent, and had therefore little hope for relea&s;e, on a &s;udden I felt the bookca&s;e move, and heard the &s;ound of men's voices, who, after much pu&s;hing and hoi&s;ting, took away what had &s;o long covered me from the eye of every beholder. In &s;hort, I found that Mrs. <HI>Stanley</HI> had taken another hou&s;e, as her lea&s;e was ex|pired; and in con&s;equence of the removal of her furniture, I again regained my liberty. One of the porters took me up, and blew off the flew which &s;o long a confinement had covered me with, and taking me down &s;tairs, pre&s;ented me to a chair woman, who was hired to clean the hou&s;e. There, mother <HI>Tru&s;ty,</HI> &s;aid he, is a pre&s;ent for you, which, if you plea&s;e, you may give to little <HI>Jenny:</HI> it will make her as fine as a lady.

art wet and dirty, and when I take any thing out of my pocket I may &s;poil it, you know. But as to making her fine, <HI>Jacob,</HI> indeed I do not de&s;ire it; and was your pre&s;ent any thing <FIGURE>
</FIGURE> to wear, &s;he &s;hould not have it; for I think finery is not &s;uitable for us. She is a <HI>good child, Jacob,</HI> and that is better than being a lady.

So &s;aying, he complained that the weather was very hot, and after wiping his face with a coar&s;e apron, which
<PB N="61" REF="021187_0059_0FB26B8A1F200C50">

Another trick which this animal had been taught, was to &s;hut the door at the word of command; and his la&s;t performance to the entertainment <FIGURE>

of my new Mi&s;tre&s;s and Mr. <HI>Jacob,</HI> was to pick up his ma&s;ter's wig, and bring it upon his head, which made indeed a very droll figure to the &s;pectators.

of two neat little rooms, in a &s;mall hou&s;e, about the middle of a very plea&s;ant lane. A clean looking boy and girl were &s;itting at the door, with a coloured apron full of peas, which they were very bu&s;ily &s;helling.

But pray, <HI>Jenny,</HI> &s;tay until you have done, and have wa&s;hed your hands, &s;aid her grandmother; for it would be a pity to &s;poil this nice &s;attin <HI>Pincu&s;hion</HI>: And what have you brought for me? cried ro|&s;y <HI>Dick?</HI> as he emptied a handful of peas into the ba&s;on.

<HI>Tru&s;ty,</HI> while the tears of affection rolled down her aged cheeks. Ju&s;t &s;uch a man was thy father, <HI>Dick.</HI> While he was alive, we never wanted for any thing.

<P>Perhaps it may be thought an uncommon ef|fort for little <HI>Dick</HI> to turn poet at &s;o early an age, and with &s;o few advantages from
<PB N="71" REF="021187_0069_0FB26BB1A5896BB8">
education. But there is no an&s;wering for the powers of natural genius, and many a one may regard an attempt as <HI>impo&s;&s;ible,</HI> merely becau&s;e they are too indolent to exert their faculties. <HI>Richard</HI> had been taught to read and write at the charity &s;chool of the pari&s;h where he lived; and as no application had been wanting on his part, the progre&s;s he made did equal credit to his own abilities, and the attention of his ma&s;|ter, with whom his merit had made him a great favourite.</P>
<P><HI>Jenny</HI> was likewi&s;e put to a &s;mall &s;chool at a little di&s;tance, by the benevolence of the vic|ar's wife, (with whom &s;uch in&s;tances were very frequent) and by her a&s;&s;iduity recommended her&s;elf to her mi&s;tre&s;s, who would often pro|po&s;e her example as a pattern to the re&s;t of her &s;cholars.</P>
<P>The next morning, when mother <HI>Tru&s;ty</HI> got up to her daily labour, &s;he ki&s;&s;ed her grand|children, and told them to go to &s;chool early, and not &s;tay and play afterwards; but to re|turn back again, for &s;he would probably come home to dinner. This they promi&s;ed to do; and after they had learnt their le&s;&s;ons, they affectionately hugged each other, and dili|gently &s;et forward with their books in their hands. But <HI>Jenny</HI> in a few minutes returned to fetch me, in order to exhibit her new pre|&s;ent

to her &s;chool fellows. We &s;oon arrived at a cottage, who&s;e apartments were neither large or numerous; but the exqui&s;ite clean|ne&s;s of it was truly admirable. The mi&s;tre&s;s, who&s;e name was <HI>Markall,</HI> was dre&s;&s;ed in a blue and white &s;triped gown, which was rather of the coar&s;e&s;t materials; but was put on with the neatne&s;s of a Quaker, as was a plain bordered mob, with a white cloth binder, and a coloured &s;ilk handkerchief; which, with the addition of a checked apron, and a black petticoat, will give a pretty good idea of her appearance.
<PB N="73" REF="021187_0071_0FB26BBB51ECE1E8">
She commended <HI>Jenny</HI> for coming early, and having enquired after her grandmother and brother, heard her read, and repeat the le&s;&s;on &s;he had the day before given her to learn. Soon after which, <HI>Bet&s;ey Field, Nanny Hay,</HI> and the re&s;t of the &s;cholars arrived; among which num|ber were likewi&s;e &s;everal boys. As the room door (which indeed was the door of the hou&s;e too) was left open for the benefit of the air, and as one of the forms where the girls were at work, was placed on that &s;ide, they were many of them better di&s;po&s;ed to watch the pa&s;&s;ing of a cart, or a wheelbarrow; or to attend the flight of birds, and butterflies, than to mind their works: and Mrs. <HI>Markall</HI> puni&s;hed &s;everal of them, with a few &s;trokes of a little cane, which lay on her table for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>After &s;he had heard them read, they &s;tood round her in a circle to &s;pell; and tho&s;e who were &s;o negligent as to mi&s;take, lo&s;t their place in the &s;et, and exchanged with their more at|tentive companions. A precedency in the ring was coveted with great ardour, and en|couraged a &s;pirit of emulation among them, as to &s;tand fir&s;t (which was my mi&s;tre&s;s's di&s;|tinction) was regarded as an acknowledg|ment of &s;uperior excellence. When they had fini&s;hed their bu&s;ine&s;s, and the wi&s;hed for

hour of twelve &s;truck, from the church clock, which was very near Mrs. <HI>Markall</HI>'s hou&s;e, they all made their ru&s;tick courte&s;ies and bows to the Dame, and poured, like a &s;warm of &s;um|mer flies, into the lane. The whole body of them &s;tood for a few moments to interchange their mutual &s;alutations; when &s;ome divided to the right hand, and the other party to the left, which led to the church porch; where they &s;eated them&s;elves to be &s;heltered from the inten&s;e heat of the &s;un; and <HI>Jenny,</HI> with a &s;mile of con&s;cious &s;atisfaction, produced me to her companions. Though &s;he was anxious to di&s;|play <FIGURE>

<PB N="75" REF="021187_0073_0FB26BBDD8E788B8">
what &s;he was &s;o well plea&s;ed with her&s;elf, yet &s;he began to be apprehen&s;ive for my &s;afety, when the girls, with unpoli&s;hed rudene&s;s, all &s;crambled for a &s;ight of her pre&s;ent at the &s;ame time. At la&s;t the two who&s;e names were above mentioned, pur&s;ued <HI>Polly Chant,</HI> who was in po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of me, and after &s;cuffling on the gra&s;s, until <HI>Nanny Hay</HI> knocked her head with great violence again&s;t one of the tomb &s;tones, and <HI>Bet&s;ey</HI> &s;prained her wri&s;t in trying to wrench me from <HI>Polly,</HI> &s;he ran home with the prize with &s;o much &s;wiftne&s;s, as to out&s;trip all her competitors. What became of poor <HI>Jenny</HI> I cannot tell, nor how &s;he bore the lo&s;s of me; but I could not help reflecting how much bet|ter it would have been, had the&s;e girls been &s;ufficiently polite, to have each &s;atisfied their own curio&s;ity, and then have re&s;igned me to the in&s;pection of others. Whereas, by all eagerly &s;natching me at once, they dirted my out&s;ide, and pulled me quite out of &s;hape; together with making them all very angry, and fooli&s;hly commencing a quarrel, of which the fir&s;t con&s;equences were the wounds I have mentioned. <HI>Polly Chant,</HI> who&s;e property I &s;o unju&s;tly became, was the daughter of the pari&s;h clerk. He was by trade a &s;hoemaker, and had three children, two girls and a boy. His wife was a notable little woman, who
<PB N="76" REF="021187_0074_0FB26BBF6A4D25B8">
took care of &s;ome poultry, pigs, and a&s;&s;es, which were allowed to feed upon a green be|fore the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as my new mi&s;tre&s;s arrived at home, her mother ordered her to prepare what was wanted for dinner; at the &s;ame time telling her, &s;he was much di&s;plea&s;ed that &s;he did not return from &s;chool &s;ooner. <HI>Polly</HI> an&s;wered in a manner which convinced me, &s;he was more pert than prudent; and ran into a little back wa&s;h hou&s;e to her &s;i&s;ter, who was taking a piece of bacon out of the &s;aucepan, and who likewi&s;e chid her delay; adding, that dinner was ready, and &s;he had been wanted to lay the table cloth. In reply to this, &s;he told the hi&s;tory I have ju&s;t related, and produced me to her &s;i&s;ter, who wiping her hands on a bit of rag which hung on a nail in the window, took me up to examine: When, lo! <HI>Polly,</HI> who was at all times too ha&s;ty to attend to rea&s;on, not chu&s;ing that <HI>Sukey</HI> &s;hould touch me for fear of &s;poiling my beauty, ha&s;tily &s;natched me from her, and dropped me, not into the &s;auce|pan, which I e&s;caped, but into a ba&s;on of &s;oap and water which &s;tood near it, and in which Mrs. <HI>Chant</HI> had ju&s;t been wa&s;hing her hands. Upon this aro&s;e a quarrel between the &s;i&s;ters,

But the folly of &s;uch behaviour mu&s;t be evident to every reflecting mind,
<PB N="78" REF="021187_0076_0FB26BCE5989EB08">
when it is con&s;idered, that although the &s;cenes I have mentioned pa&s;&s;ed in the low life of poverty, yet the &s;ame ill humour, would occa&s;ion equal animo&s;ity, in the mo&s;t affluent circum&s;tances. And though no &s;ituation can ju&s;tify fretful petulence, yet, it is certainly more excu&s;able in girls, who were untaught by education, and unpoli&s;hed by politene&s;s, than in tho&s;e, with whom the utmo&s;t care has been exerted, and who have had all the advantages of reading and in&s;truction to con|tribute to their improvement. That it is po&s;&s;ible for good humour, and a determined endeavour to plea&s;e, in a great mea&s;ure to &s;upply the deficiency of acquired graces, may be &s;een in the characters of <HI>Richard</HI> and <HI>Jenny,</HI> who&s;e affection to each other mu&s;t in|tere&s;t every one in their favour: And the &s;ame &s;weetne&s;s of temper, will likewi&s;e re|commend to my reader's e&s;teem, the agreeable <HI>Hannah Mindful,</HI> to whom I was given one <HI>Sunday</HI> afternoon, by <HI>Polly Chant,</HI> in a walk which they took together after church.

very worthy woman, but was afflicted with &s;uch bad health, that &s;he was &s;eldom able to leave her bed.

She thanked him very civilly, and af|ter wi&s;hing him good night, ran home as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible, for fear her mother &s;hould want her; to whom &s;he immediately pre&s;ented her pre&s;ent, without offering to ta&s;te either of them her&s;elf. A niece of Mr. <HI>Mindful's</HI> lived at this time at his hou&s;e, who&s;e name was <HI>Sally Flaunt</HI>; and who had been a half boarder, at a great &s;chool near <HI>London,</HI> where &s;he was put by a relation, who&s;e death had left her no friend but her uncle.

When <HI>Hannah</HI> ro&s;e in the morn|ing to a&s;&s;i&s;t in getting breakfa&s;t, dre&s;&s;ing her &s;i&s;ters, and making the beds, <HI>Sally</HI> would di&s;|dainfully turn round to &s;leep, becau&s;e it was
<PB N="81" REF="021187_0079_0FB26BD2153E6678">
in her &s;illy opinion, unlike a lady to get up early. Without any fortune, or the &s;lighte&s;t recommendation but her indu&s;try, &s;he was ever fooli&s;hly aiming at a rank in life, to which &s;he had no preten&s;ions; and without &s;en&s;e to di&s;tingui&s;h, that it is gracefulne&s;s of manners, and &s;uperiour learning, that forms the e&s;&s;ential difference between high life and poverty; and that merit is as much entitled to re&s;pect in the lowe&s;t circum&s;tances of indigence, as in the mo&s;t exalted &s;tation, &s;he was &s;o weak as to imagine, that by imitating &s;ome of tho&s;e foi|bles &s;he had &s;een in girls who had more for|tune than under&s;tanding, &s;he would be thought to re&s;emble them, and meet with that regard which is not be&s;towed on riches, but on the &s;uppo&s;ed worth of tho&s;e who po&s;&s;e&s;s them. While <HI>Hannah</HI> went up &s;tairs to carry &s;ome water gruel to her mother, &s;he di&s;patched one of her little &s;i&s;ters to tell <HI>Sally</HI> that breakfa&s;t was ready; but as &s;he had &s;lept &s;o long, it was &s;ome time before &s;he could make her ap|pearance; and Mr. <HI>Mindful,</HI> who was ju&s;tly di&s;plea&s;ed with her indolence, told one of his children to carry her milk away; for that tho&s;e who were too lazy to provide for them|&s;elves, and to be ready at the proper time, might go without food.

your bread. Behave as you &s;hould, and I will treat you as my own child: but if you have too much pride to know your duty, and will not mind my advice, I will turn you out, to try where you can live better than with me." <HI>Sally</HI> knew &s;he dare not reply to this po&s;itive &s;peech; and fearing her uncle &s;hould become more angry, &s;he promi&s;ed to behave better, and walked up &s;tairs to <HI>Hannah,</HI> who was du&s;ting the furniture in her own room. To her &s;he related the above particulars, with the tears running down her cheeks, and with the mo&s;t di&s;mal &s;obs of di&s;tre&s;s and pa&s;&s;ion. My good natured mi&s;tre&s;s compa&s;&s;ionately ki&s;&s;ed her, and wept to &s;ee her di&s;turbance; but in|deed, my dear <HI>Sally,</HI> &s;aid &s;he, I wi&s;h you would try to exert your&s;elf, and as you <HI>cannot</HI> be a lady, you had better endeavour to plea&s;e my father. You &s;ee, we all live very happily, and I am &s;ure I would do all in my power to make you do &s;o too: &s;o cheer up your &s;pirits, and don't weep &s;o &s;adly. "I can't, replied <HI>Sally,</HI> very cro&s;sly! indeed you may, who have never &s;een any higher life; but where I was at &s;chool, do you think any of the ladies &s;coured the rooms, or milked the cow, or went to &s;uch work as wa&s;hing and ironing? O! <HI>Hannah,</HI> had you &s;een the caps, and feathers, and mu&s;|lin, and gauze frocks, which they u&s;ed to wear

on a dancing day, and how &s;mart they looked in their &s;ilk &s;hoes, or el&s;e red morocco ones, you would not wonder that I do not like the&s;e great black leather things (and &s;he &s;cornfully to&s;&s;ed out her foot as &s;he &s;poke.) Indeed, <HI>Hannah,</HI> I could cry, whenever I &s;ee you and your &s;i&s;ters clothed in &s;uch coar&s;e gowns, with your black wor&s;ted &s;tockings, and with that check handkerchief on your neck, and your round cloth caps, with that piece of linen for a ribbon. I cannot bear it! and I wi&s;h I was any thing but what I am." O, fie, <HI>Sally!</HI> &s;aid <HI>Hannah,</HI> that is quite ungrateful for the good things which you are ble&s;&s;ed with, to talk in &s;uch a manner as that. "What good things? retorted the haughty girl, rai&s;ing her voice, and growing more angry. Do you call this dowlas &s;hift, this coar&s;e apron, this lin&s;ey wol&s;ey gown, <HI>good things?</HI> Or do you call the brown bread we eat, or the hard dumplings you was making ju&s;t now, <HI>good things?</HI> And, pray, this old worm eaten bed without any curtains to it, and this little window which is too &s;mall to admit one's head out, and what a little hole there is, quite crammed full of honey&s;uckles; or this propped up che&s;t of drawers, or that good for nothing chair with a great hole in the bottom, which you know, <HI>Bet,</HI> nearly felt through ye&s;terday, when &s;he got upon it to reach

the box which holds her <HI>Sunday</HI> &s;traw hat; do you call the&s;e <HI>good things?</HI> becau&s;e if you do, I am &s;orry you know no better." I &s;hould be &s;orry indeed, rejoined <HI>Hannah,</HI> with rather more di&s;plea&s;ure than was u&s;ual to her, if I knew &s;o much of high life, as to be di&s;con|tented with what my father and mother can afford. I think our bread is as good as any body need wi&s;h for? and I am &s;ure the dump|lings you &s;o &s;cornfully mention, will be very well ta&s;ted and whole&s;ome. As to the furni|ture, if it is old, I will an&s;wer for its being clean, <HI>Sally</HI>; and my father &s;ays he can nail a piece of board over that chair, which will la&s;t as many years as the back does. And as to our clothes, I am &s;ure they are whole and tight; for I would work my fingers to the bone, before I would &s;ee them otherwi&s;e.

I a&s;&s;ure you, &s;he has &s;ometimes eat our bread, and always &s;aid it was very good. <HI>Hannah</HI> was here interrupted by one of her &s;i&s;ters, who came to call her to a&s;&s;i&s;t her mother who was going to get up. She attended her immediately, and taking me out of her pocket, into which &s;he ha&s;tily put me at the conclu&s;ion of the above conver&s;ation, &s;he placed me on the table, while &s;he a&s;&s;i&s;ted Mrs. <HI>Mindful</HI> in putting on a clean cap and bed gown; and after &s;he had helped her to an old elbow chair, &s;he made the bed; which, as &s;oon as &s;he had fini&s;hed, &s;he went in|to the garden, and returning with a nice no&s;e|gay of flowers, placed them in a little white &s;tone mug upon the table, in order by their &s;weetne&s;s, to refre&s;h and plea&s;e her mother, as &s;he was very fond of them. She then ki&s;&s;ed her with great tenderne&s;s, and begged her to take an egg beat up with &s;ome milk, which &s;he immediately got ready. The&s;e little &s;er|vices were all performed with &s;o much alacrity and good nature, and &s;uch vi&s;ible plea&s;ure in her countenance, as doubled the merit of all her actions. It was impo&s;&s;ible inded to &s;ee her, without thinking how very agreeable it is in the power of good nature and indu&s;try, to make tho&s;e who have no other advantages to recommend them.</P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="021187_0086_0FB26BEA2257CF20"><HI>Hannah Mindful</HI> was a healthy looking country girl, her complexion was burnt by the &s;un, and her hands hardened by laborious toil; &s;he was not ornamented by dre&s;s, though her per&s;on was at all times made agreeable by neatne&s;s: She had never been taught tho&s;e graces, which &s;o forcibly recommend the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;or to general ob&s;ervation; but a con&s;tant cheerfulne&s;s, and a de&s;ire of obliging, which was never interrupted by petulance, made her beloved by every one who knew her. To be as good natured as <HI>Hannah Mindful,</HI> was the highe&s;t prai&s;e of every girl in the village; and every mother was ready to propo&s;e her conduct, as an example to her own children. If there was a piece of bread, which her &s;i&s;ters liked better than the re&s;t of the loaf, &s;he would &s;ave it for them by turns, when|ever &s;he had opportunity. If any of them went out to play, and forgot the bu&s;ine&s;s which fell to their &s;hare, or which their mo|ther had ordered them to do, &s;he would either fetch them home again, or, (if in her power) do it for them her&s;elf. By this &s;he often &s;aved them from puni&s;hment. One day when her father had brought two ribbands from a fair, for her &s;i&s;ter <HI>Molly</HI> and her&s;elf, he gave <HI>Hannah</HI> the liberty of chu&s;ing fir&s;t. She directly took a pink, which was her favourite colour; and
<PB N="89" REF="021187_0087_0FB26BEB98C0EA00">
left a dark green, which was what &s;he mo&s;t di&s;liked: but afterwards finding her &s;i&s;ter wi&s;hed for the one &s;he had cho&s;en, &s;he gave it her immediately, with as much readine&s;s, as if &s;he had approved of the exchange from the preference to the colour &s;he di&s;liked. <HI>Sally</HI> told her &s;he thought it was fooli&s;h to give up <FIGURE>

plea&s;ure to my dear <HI>Molly,</HI> than I &s;hould re|ceive from any difference of colour, or from a pre&s;ent of much greater value. <HI>Sally</HI> was not of that opinion; for the indulgence of pride, is the occa&s;ion of &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, and the cau&s;e of the mo&s;t de&s;picable meanne&s;s. By wi&s;hing for greater riches, and de&s;pi&s;ing that way of life to which &s;he was de&s;tined, her heart was con&s;tantly agitated, by anxious vexation. Whereas, <HI>Hannah</HI> was always cheer|ful, good humoured, and contented: And the &s;ame incidents, which to the one were the oc|ca&s;ion of di&s;&s;atisfaction and complaint, the other &s;ubmitted to without repining, and re|joiced with gratitude at the felicity of her lot. And thus, my young readers, will it be with per&s;ons of higher rank, than tho&s;e of whom I am now writing. If you make your&s;elf un|happy, becau&s;e &s;ome of your companions have more elegant clothes, or a greater variety than your&s;elf; or becau&s;e it may &s;uit the for|tune of their parents, to make more &s;plendid entertainments, than the choice or circum|&s;tances of your's will admit; if they ride in their father's carriage, while you walk on foot and unattended, remember, that is no rational cau&s;e of unea&s;ine&s;s. It is not the <HI>&s;tation,</HI> but the propriety with which it is &s;u&s;tained, that is the real matter of concern. A <HI>beggar</HI> may be
<PB N="91" REF="021187_0089_0FB26BF21C3F5A90">
more re&s;pectable than a <HI>Prince,</HI> if he is &s;unk to indigence by misfortune; and exerts his utmo&s;t powers, to act with indu&s;try, and maintain the proper conduct which his &s;itua|tion requires. Let me advi&s;e you then, not to wi&s;h for that finery which would be un&s;uita|ble to your circum&s;tances; but to &s;ubmit to the di&s;cretion of your parents, becau&s;e they mu&s;t know be&s;t what is proper for you. <HI>Sally Flaunt</HI> had not the power to make her uncle's brown bread the lea&s;t degree whiter, although &s;he was too fretful to eat it with &s;atisfaction. She could not enlarge the rooms, or repair the furniture, by her di&s;content; but &s;he might have been as happy as her cou&s;in, had &s;he been di&s;po&s;ed to be good humoured. When any bu&s;ine&s;s is nece&s;&s;ary to be performed, if it is done with &s;ullenne&s;s and ill will, it becomes the mo&s;t laborious toil, and mo&s;t irk&s;ome em|ployment; but if it is executed with cheerful|ne&s;s, it is much &s;ooner di&s;patched, and the fatigue is con&s;iderably abated. It is time, However, to return to my own adventures, without tre&s;pa&s;&s;ing longer on your patience by my advice.</P>
<P>I had continued &s;ome time with my mi&s;|tre&s;s, when Mr. <HI>Goodall</HI> (who&s;e daughter I believe I have beforementioned) gave an enter|tainment to his tenants, on account of her at|taining

her eighteenth year. Mr. <HI>Mindful</HI> out of kindne&s;s to his family, determined to &s;tay at home him&s;elf, and take care of his wife, while he di&s;patched all the young ones who were of a proper age, to enjoy an amu&s;e|ment which would afford them &s;o much plea|&s;ure. <HI>Hannah</HI> dre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf and two &s;i&s;ters, as neat as ru&s;tick &s;implicity could adorn them. They had each of them light brown &s;tuff gowns, white aprons and handkerchiefs, with &s;traw hats; her own with green, and her &s;i&s;ters with pink ribbons. They had all a no&s;egay of flowers in their bo&s;oms, and with the fre&s;h|ne&s;s of innocence and health glowing in their <FIGURE>

<P><HI>Jack Mindful,</HI> her brother, was a lad of about thirteen, very active and &s;prightly, and &s;ometimes apt to be extremely mi&s;chievous. I have had no opportunity before this to in|troduce him to the notice of my readers; but the part he took in dre&s;&s;ing his cou&s;in for the intended &s;port, will make it nece&s;&s;ary to exhib|it him on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion. <HI>Sally,</HI> who&s;e attention was wholly engro&s;&s;ed by the pride of excelling her companions in the finery of her clothes, had been for &s;ome days bu&s;ily em|ployed in mending an old &s;ilk coat, which had been given her during her &s;tay at &s;chool. It had originally been ornamented with gauze cuffs, which were grown dirty and yellow with keeping: the re&s;t of the trimming was &s;ufficiently decayed, to make it a rather de&s;|picable garb; and Mrs. <HI>Mindful,</HI> who ju&s;tly thought &s;uch &s;habby finery very improper for her niece's &s;ituation, in&s;i&s;ted upon her going in a new garnet coloured &s;tuff, which &s;he had lately bought her. This <HI>Sally</HI> was much di&s;|tre&s;&s;ed at, and communicated her intention to her cou&s;in <HI>Jack,</HI> who promi&s;ed to a&s;&s;i&s;t her in
<PB N="94" REF="021187_0092_0FB26BFAA8D46C50">
her de&s;ign; which was, after &s;he had taken leave of Mrs. <HI>Mindful,</HI> to carry her clothes to a barn at &s;ome di&s;tance, and there put on the <HI>&s;ilk coat,</HI> which &s;he imagined would make her &s;o much better re&s;pected by the family at <HI>Oakly Hall.</HI> To this place then &s;he repaired, her heart beating with expectation, and flat|tered with the imagination of out&s;hining all her companions. She had made up a new cap for the occa&s;ion; and as &s;he was very tall and womanly in her appearance, thought if &s;he could make any &s;ub&s;titute for a cu&s;hion it would much improve her fa&s;hionable appearance. On this great occa&s;ion, &s;he borrowed me of <HI>Hannah,</HI> who went before her cou&s;in; as &s;he did not chu&s;e to have any wit|ne&s;s but <HI>Jack,</HI> who was the only per&s;on en|tru&s;ted with this important &s;ecret. At the barn then we &s;oon arrived, and her &s;tuff gown was thrown off with di&s;dain, while &s;he pre|pared, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of an old triangular bit of a broken looking gla&s;s, to equip for the de&s;irable expedition. After placing the cu&s;hion,

</FIGURE> which &s;he had taken great pains to complete, and pinning her hair over it with a piece of black ribbon, &s;he put on her cap; which ex|hibited the mo&s;t tawdry collection of old gauze, bits of ribbon, and &s;latternly ta&s;&s;els, that can well be imagined. At la&s;t came the trial of the coat, which as it had been made very long behind, was in that re&s;pect tolerable; but its appearance in front was &s;o &s;hort, as to be really ridiculous. During the time &s;he was looking at her head in the gla&s;s, <HI>Jack</HI> in turn|ing round ha&s;tily threw it down a hole which he had purpo&s;ely contrived, and where it was impo&s;&s;ible to regain it, as it was &s;o in&s;tantly
<PB N="96" REF="021187_0094_0FB26C022241E5C0">
out of &s;ight, that <HI>Sally</HI> had not an idea where it had vani&s;hed, her &s;earch was to|tally in vain, and &s;he could only fini&s;h her dre&s;s by <HI>Jack</HI>'s direction. He pretended to admire her appearance extremely, and to make it the more complete, he had before tied a coup|le of &s;heep's feet to a piece of ribbon, which he now pinned to her &s;houlders, fa&s;tening them clo&s;e to her back with another &s;tring which he likewi&s;e pinned down; and by way of addi|tion to the &s;treamers in her cap, he &s;u&s;pended a number of bits of &s;traw, which he had tied together with a piece of pack thread. With the&s;e burle&s;que ornaments &s;he hurried with <FIGURE>

<PB N="97" REF="021187_0095_0FB26C0395D4DE00">
him to the <HI>Hall</HI>; and as &s;he was entering the door which led to the hou&s;e, under pre|tence of fa&s;tening a piece of the trimming which he &s;aid he could improve, he undid the lower pins, and let the &s;heep's feet dance about on her back, to the un&s;peakable entertainment of every beholder. The laugh which her ap|pearance occa&s;ioned covered her with confu|&s;ion; and her pride was mortified in the highe&s;t degree, to find her finery treated with &s;uch a degree of contemptuous mirth, in&s;tead of that admiration with which &s;he had flattered her|&s;elf. The boys were eager to di&s;&s;ect her head-dre&s;s, and <HI>Polly Chant,</HI> who was of the party, very maliciou&s;ly pinned one of her cuffs to the table cloth, as &s;he was lolling her head on her hand to hide tho&s;e tears of vexation which &s;he could not forbear. Unfortunately &s;he ro&s;e in &s;ome ha&s;te, upon the appearance of Mr. <HI>Good|all,</HI> who entered the room to welcome his gue&s;ts, and dragged down the &s;alt &s;eller, and &s;everal plates, knives, forks, and &s;poons; which had they been brittle materials, would have been certainly demoli&s;hed; but as the whole &s;ervice was of pewter, they e&s;caped un|hurt. The bu&s;tle which this accident occa|&s;ioned, &s;till more di&s;concerted the unfortunate <HI>Sally Flaunt,</HI> who bur&s;ting into tears very ha&s;tily left the room. In the angry jirk with
<PB N="98" REF="021187_0096_0FB26C07620025B8">
which &s;he walked away from the company, her two &s;houlders were &s;aluted with the &s;heep's feet, in &s;uch a manner as to make her imagine &s;he had received a blow, which &s;he turned round very quickly in order to re&s;ent; but the agility of her motions, only &s;erved to repeat the imag|ined offence, the author of which, however, &s;he found it impo&s;&s;ible to di&s;cern. But as &s;he was going through an apartment which led to the garden, &s;he di&s;covered her own figure in a large pier gla&s;s; the &s;ight of which, &s;o fully completed her vexation, that &s;he determined to hurry home immediately, and &s;natching her handkerchief from her pocket to wipe her eyes, &s;he whirled me out with it to a con&s;ider|able di&s;tance, and without perceiving her lo&s;s, left me to enjoy my own reflections. The thought of <HI>Sally</HI>'s ridiculous vanity entirely took up my attention. How happily might &s;he have pa&s;&s;ed the day had &s;he been content|ed to do &s;o in her proper character; but by a&s;&s;uming a &s;uperiority to her companions, &s;he excited the contempt of <HI>Jack Mindful,</HI> who was determined to mortify her pride, by mak|ing her an object of ridicule; and though his mi&s;chievous intention was certainly extremely blameable, yet it was her own folly which put the execution of it into his power. Had &s;he not determined &s;o meanly to deceive, and
<PB N="99" REF="021187_0097_0FB26C099ADFE9D0">
di&s;obey her aunt, by pretending to comply with her advice, at the very moment &s;he was preparing to act in oppo&s;ition to it, &s;he would have e&s;caped that mortification, which, how|ever it might excite pity, was undoubtedly de&s;erved.</P>
<P>I lay unperceived by the door of a little clo&s;et until the next morning; when Mrs. <HI>Betty,</HI> who came to &s;weep the room, picked me up, <FIGURE>
</FIGURE> and laid me for &s;ome time on a marble &s;lab, and after &s;he had fini&s;hed her bu&s;ine&s;s, I accom|panied her to breakfa&s;t. My new mi&s;tre&s;s was a plea&s;ing young woman, who was a hou&s;e|maid in Mr. <HI>Goodall</HI>'s family. She &s;at down
<PB N="100" REF="021187_0098_0FB26C105EA1B490">with the laundry maid, who&s;e name was <HI>Joice,</HI> and who complained very much of the heat of the weather. I have been &s;o ill for &s;ome days pa&s;t, &s;aid &s;he, that I can with difficulty &s;tand to wa&s;h; and the heat of the fire when I am ironing, makes me much wor&s;e than I &s;hould otherwi&s;e be; and then Mi&s;s <HI>Sophy</HI> is &s;o care|le&s;s, &s;he never con&s;iders what will dirt her clothes, nor how much work &s;he occa&s;ions. I am &s;ure her &s;i&s;ter at her age was always neat and nice with half the number of frocks and petticoats which &s;he requires. I wonder that a young lady &s;hould not have more compa&s;&s;ion for a poor &s;ervant. "That is becau&s;e they do not know the trouble it is, replied <HI>Betty</HI>; but indeed <HI>Joice,</HI> Mi&s;s <HI>Sophy</HI> is the &s;ame
in every thing. If &s;he is cutting a piece of gauze or paper &s;he is &s;ure to make a litter all over the room; and I have often &s;een her cut a card into a thou&s;and bits on the carpet, without making any u&s;e of it at all; and if &s;he is undo|ing her work, or picking her doll's clothes to pieces, &s;he will &s;trew the threads on the floor, without thinking how much trouble it gives me to take them up again. But if &s;he would but put her bits of rubbi&s;h into a piece of pa|per, it might be taken away without any diffi|culty." She will never be beloved like her &s;i&s;ter, &s;aid <HI>Joice.</HI> And then &s;he does not look

But what I am mo&s;t angry with her for, is &s;lopping her milk, or tea, on the tables, ju&s;t after I have rubbed them until they are as bright as looking-gla&s;&s;es; and then &s;he &s;mears her hand acro&s;s, and all my labour goes for nothing. I won|der how &s;he would like this hot day to have &s;uch violent exerci&s;e. But ladies have often little con&s;ideration for their &s;ervants feelings." To be &s;ure, &s;aid Mrs. <HI>Joice,</HI> my ma&s;ter and mi&s;tre&s;s, and Mi&s;s <HI>Goodall,</HI> are very good na|tured, <HI>Betty</HI>; and Mi&s;s <HI>Sophy</HI> will I hope, think more of the con&s;equence of her ac|tions when &s;he is older. I would do any thing in the world for my mi&s;tre&s;s &s;he &s;peaks &s;o kindly, and when I am ill, &s;he &s;ays, "Take your time, <HI>Joice,</HI> and don't fatigue your&s;elf today, I hope you will be better tomorrow." I don't care how I &s;lave when people are con&s;iderate, and &s;eem to think I do my duty. During the latter part of this conver&s;ation, Mrs. <HI>Betty</HI> had laid me on the table, and was pinning her gown clo&s;e, which had before hung loo&s;e, only fa&s;tened with one pin at the top, and the two &s;ides turned be|hind; and at the conclu&s;ion of it, Mrs. <HI>Joice,</HI> who had been clearing away the breakfa&s;t things, folded me up in the table cloth, and

carrying me under her arm to the poultry yard, &s;hook me out with the crumbs. She turned round at the &s;ame time, to &s;peak to a gardener, who was emptying &s;ome weeds out of his blue apron upon the dunghill, and did not &s;ee my <FIGURE>

My la&s;t unfortunate adventure has &s;o dirtied my out&s;ide, that I &s;hould not now be known.
