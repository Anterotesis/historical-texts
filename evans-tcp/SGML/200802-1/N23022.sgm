</EPIGRAPH>
<P>AS the doctrine of a future &s;tate of retribution is the principal &s;upport of piety and virtue, the great and univer&s;al importance of it mu&s;t be obvious. And that this is a doctrine "worthy of all acceptation," we have the concurrent te&s;timonies of natural and revealed religion.</P>
<P>Our text leads us to con&s;ider&mdash;The certainty of a future judgment&mdash;Some of the peculiarities of this judgment, as revealed in the go&s;pel&mdash;And the purpo&s;es for which God hath appointed it.</P>
<P>In regard to the certainty of a future &s;tate of ret|ribution, let it be ob&s;erved,</P>
<P>That the judgment we pa&s;s upon our own actions, or that faculty by which we di&s;cover the difference between good and evil, is the foundation of many of
<PB N="6" REF="030424_0004_0FE6D0F3984A0098">
our mo&s;t plea&s;ing hopes, and of our mo&s;t di&s;quieting fears. The &s;atisfactions which accompany a life of innocence, are greatly increa&s;ed by the expectation of a future recompence; and the terrors of a guilty con|&s;cience as greatly enhanced.</P>
<P>And we &s;ee, in many in&s;tances, that the di&s;pen&s;ations of Providence in the pre&s;ent &s;tate, are promi&s;cuous and unequal. No certain conclu&s;ions can be drawn from them, in regard to the virtue or the vice of men. The righteous often &s;uffer, and for being righteous: And the wicked pro&s;per, and pro&s;per through their wickedne&s;s.</P>
<P>And although the wi&s;e and con&s;iderate in all ages, from a conviction that virtue was excellent in it&s;elf, and that vice was pernicious in its own nature, have endeavored to reward the former, and to puni&s;h the latter, according to their re&s;pective merits; yet no human laws have ever been able to effect the&s;e mo&s;t de&s;irable purpo&s;es. No human tribunal can inve&s;tigate the &s;ecret emotions of the heart, the &s;ource from which all our actions proceed; and in proportion to the re|lation which they bear to this fountain, they de&s;erve either cen&s;ure, or prai&s;e. The &s;pecious hypocrite may come forward, and challenge the &s;evere&s;t &s;crutiny, while the fear of a di&s;covery has led him to com|mit his vile enormities in the dark. But, that im|partial ju&s;tice may be di&s;pen&s;ed, the motives and intentions of the agent mu&s;t be known. The rich, who, of their abundance ca&s;t much into the trea&s;ury, will undoubtedly receive their reward; and yet, the poor widow's two mites may entitle her to a much greater recompence.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="030424_0005_0FE6D0FC6E42E928">Should the internal &s;atisfactions which accompany a virtuous life, and the mi&s;eries which commonly overtake the wicked, be urged, as an adequate reward to the former, and a &s;ufficient puni&s;hment to the latter; it may be a&s;ked, whether any degree of external afflu|ence, in addition to the plea&s;ures which flow from a good con&s;cience, &s;eparate from the views of eternity, would be deemed by a wi&s;e man, an adequate recom|pence for the exqui&s;ite &s;ufferings with which the in|flexibly virtuous are &s;ometimes called to &s;truggle?</P>
<P>As the&s;e inequalities have been from the beginning of the world, we have all rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e, that they will continue unto the end of it. And from this &s;tate of things, it is natural to conclude, that there will be a future &s;tate of retribution, in which all the&s;e inequali|ties will be rectified, and impartial ju&s;tice di&s;pen&s;ed to every man.</P>
<P>And this has been the prevailing opinion, in every age, and in every nation. It is true, that one &s;ect of philo&s;o|phers among the heathen, and &s;ome among the Jews, denied the re&s;urrection of the dead; but tho&s;e charac|ters were not very numerous; they bore &s;carce any kind of proportion to the body of the people, the great mul|titude, who received the doctrine of a future judgment. On no other principle can we account for the wor&s;hip of the dead; and for the animated de&s;criptions which the poets have given of the Ely&s;ian fields: In which all the virtuous are repre&s;ented in a &s;tate of happine&s;s, and in the enjoyment of the fruits of their pa&s;t labors: While the wicked are excluded tho&s;e happy abodes, and con&s;igned to the regions of wo and mi&s;ery forever. And although the rewards and puni&s;hments a&s;&s;igned
<PB N="8" REF="030424_0006_0FE6D0FC79C74668">
to the&s;e characters, in the future world, are very differ|ent in their nature, from tho&s;e which revelation has taught <HI>us</HI> to expect hereafter, and fall infinitely below them; yet they are &s;trongly expre&s;&s;ive of the general opinion concerning the doctrine before us. The Apo&s;tle, in his addre&s;s to the Gentiles, ob&s;erves, that, "the invi&s;ible things of him," (God) "from the creation of the world, are clearly &s;een, being under|&s;tood by the things which are made, even his eternal power and Godhead. So that they are without excu&s;e, becau&s;e that, when they knew God, they glorified him not as God."</P>
<P>But, although the religion of nature taught men to expect a future &s;tate of retribution, in which they would be rewarded and puni&s;hed, according to their re&s;pective de&s;erts, (and the evidences of this great doctrine have been confirmed by every revelation which God has given of him&s;elf), yet, it gave no in|timations of the circum&s;tances which would attend it. For the&s;e mo&s;t &s;olemn and intere&s;ting di&s;coveries, we are indebted to the revelation of Je&s;us Chri&s;t; through whom, "life and immortality" are "brought to light:" i. e. more fully and clearly revealed.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t of the&s;e peculiar and important di&s;coveries which I &s;hall mention, is this,&mdash;That there will be a DAY, on which all the generations of men, will be gathered together, in one great and general a&s;&s;embly, to receive the re&s;pective rewards of their pa&s;t behavior.</P>
<P>"When the Son of man &s;hall come in his glory, then &s;hall be gathered before him all nations&mdash;God hath appointed a DAY, in which he will judge the world in righteou&s;ne&s;s&mdash;But of that DAY and hour,
<PB N="9" REF="030424_0007_0FE6D0FD8B375A68">
knoweth no man, not even the Son." This is one of tho&s;e "&s;ecret things" which "belong to God." But we are informed, that this judgment will take place "at the end of the world," an indefinite period; and which may be much nearer than we apprehend! And when it &s;hall commence, we are a&s;&s;ured, that it will be accompanied by a univer&s;al re&s;urrection&mdash;of all who in this world have ever ta&s;ted death.</P>
<P>"We mu&s;t all appear before the judgment &s;eat of Chri&s;t," &amp;c. "Verily, verily, I &s;ay unto you, the hour is coming, and even now is, when the dead &s;hall hear the voice of the Son of God, and they that hear him &s;hall live."&mdash;"Marvel not at this, for the hour is coming, in which all that are in the graves &s;hall hear his voice, and &s;hall come forth, they that have done good, unto the re&s;urrection of life, and they that have done evil, unto the re&s;urrection of damnation."</P>
<P>And immediately after this general re&s;urrection, we are informed, the world which we now inhabit will appear all in flames, and be utterly de&s;troyed by fire.</P>
<P>"The Lord Je&s;us &s;hall be revealed from heaven in flaming fire, taking vengeance on them who know not God, and who obey not the go&s;pel of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t." "The day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night, in which the heavens &s;hall pa&s;s away in a great noi&s;e, and the elements &s;hall melt with fervent heat. The earth al&s;o, and all that therein is, &s;hall be burned up. Seeing then, that all the&s;e things are to be di&s;&s;olved, what manner of per&s;ons ought we to be, in all holy conver&s;ation and godline&s;s!"</P>
<P>Another circum&s;tance concerning this future judg|ment, revealed in the go&s;pel, re&s;pects the per&s;on, to
<PB N="10" REF="030424_0008_0FE6D0FD980D49A0">
whom the judiciary powers of that great and &s;olemn day are committed. And this is the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t him&s;elf. The per&s;on who once appeared in this world, in the form of a &s;ervant, and to &s;ave &s;in|ners, although "the Lord of life and glory"&mdash;"who went about doing good"&mdash;and after a life of the pure&s;t benevolence, and of un&s;potted innocence, "was taken, and by wicked hands, crucified and &s;lain. But God rai&s;ed him up."</P>
<P>"The Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment to the Son.&mdash;It is Je&s;us that is ordained of God to be the judge of quick and dead&mdash;God will judge the world in righteou&s;ne&s;s, by that man Je&s;us Chri&s;t, whom he hath appointed."</P>
<P>In &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture, God him&s;elf is &s;aid to be the judge of all the earth, and who will do right&mdash; and that he will reward every man according to his deeds; "To them who by patient continuance in well doing, &s;eek for glory, and honor, and immortality, eternal life; but unto them that are contentious, in|dignation and wrath, tribulation and angui&s;h upon every &s;oul of man that doeth evil." But the&s;e texts may be reconciled with the former, when we con&s;ider, that the future judgment will commence on the day appointed by God; and that all the tran&s;actions of it will be managed by his Son; to whom he has dele|gated his authority and power; and who will perform all the duties of that great and &s;olemn office, in per|fect obedience to the will of his Father.</P>
<P>Another peculiarity, and which de&s;erves our mo&s;t &s;erious attention, is the <HI>manner</HI> in which he will appear upon that &s;olemn occa&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="030424_0009_0FE6D1053B182898">"He &s;hall come in his own glory, in the glory of God, and in the glory of his holy angels&mdash;he &s;hall &s;it upon the throne of his glory, and all nations &s;hall be gathered before him. And he &s;hall &s;eparate them, one from the other, as a &s;hepherd divideth his &s;heep from the goats. The Lord him&s;elf &s;hall de&s;cend from heaven with a &s;hout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God. The dead in Chri&s;t &s;hall ri&s;e fir&s;t, and they that are alive &s;hall be changed, and caught up to meet the Lord in the air."</P>
<P>Further, the go&s;pel of Je&s;us Chri&s;t di&s;clo&s;es the purpo&s;es of God, in the appointment of this future judgment: namely, That his wi&s;dom, ju&s;tice, good|ne&s;s and mercy, may be univer&s;ally acknowledged and magnified&mdash;That all the ungodly may be convinced "of all their hard &s;peeches &s;poken again&s;t him"&mdash; And that the glory of the great Judge may be mo&s;t illu&s;triou&s;ly di&s;played&mdash;"That all men &s;hould honor the Son, even as they honor the Father"&mdash;Becau&s;e "thou ha&s;t loved righteou&s;ne&s;s and hated iniquity, therefore God, even thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladne&s;s above thy fellows"&mdash;be&s;towed the highe&s;t and mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed honors upon him, as a peculiar mark of his approbation&mdash;and appointed him to the important office of Judge, both of quick and dead, "becau&s;e he was the &s;on of man"&mdash;To quiet our fears and apprehen&s;ions on that great day, when we &s;hall behold, in the per&s;on of our Judge, the greate&s;t benefactor and friend of the human race&mdash;one made like unto our&s;elves&mdash;acquainted with all the imper|fections of our nature, and di&s;po&s;ed to pity and com|pa&s;&s;ionate our weakne&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="030424_0010_0FE6D1054AF45240">"It behoved him to be made like unto his brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful High Prie&s;t. For we have not an High Prie&s;t, which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities."</P>
<P>And here, it may be ob&s;erved, that there is nothing in any of the&s;e peculiar di&s;coveries of the go&s;pel, con|cerning a future judgment, incon&s;i&s;tent with the prin|ciples of natural religion. A Being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of al|mighty power can gather together all nations on that great day, as ea&s;ily as di&s;po&s;e the individuals of which this numerous a&s;&s;embly is compo&s;ed to meet together on the pre&s;ent very melancholy occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>And there can be no ab&s;urdity in believing, that the Being who fir&s;t gave us life can reanimate the bodies which we now po&s;&s;e&s;s, and clothe them with fre&s;h powers of life and &s;en&s;ibility, after they have laid ever &s;o long a period in the graves.</P>
<P>And that the unexampled obedience and &s;ufferings of our ble&s;&s;ed Lord and Savior &s;hould be mo&s;t openly acknowledged, and rewarded by the Deity, who has declared him&s;elf to be the "rewarder of all them that diligently &s;eek him," is mo&s;t agreeable to all our notions of ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>And does it not appear to be a merciful di&s;pen&s;a|tion, that the human race &s;hould be judged by one in their own likene&s;s?</P>
<P>And is it not proper and right, that the mo&s;t public and expre&s;&s;ive marks of approbation &s;hould be con|ferred upon the righteous; and that the wicked &s;hould be as openly expo&s;ed to di&s;grace and puni&s;hment?</P>
<P>Let us now attend to a few reflections, which ari&s;e from this mo&s;t intere&s;ting and important of all &s;ubjects.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="030424_0011_0FE6D107813CB620">And Fir&s;t,</P>
<P>Allowing that we know not the nature, nor the proportion of the rewards and puni&s;hments to be di&s;|pen&s;ed in a future &s;tate; yet, this is certain, the go&s;|pel has repre&s;ented them, and the &s;olemnities of a future judgment, in the &s;tronge&s;t light: and in &s;uch a manner, as to excite the mo&s;t plea&s;ing hopes in the virtuous; and the mo&s;t awful apprehen&s;ions in the wicked.</P>
<P>"Then &s;hall the King &s;ay unto them on his right hand, come ye ble&s;&s;ed of my Father, inherit the king|dom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.&mdash;Then &s;hall he &s;ay unto them on his left hand, depart from me, ye cur&s;ed, into everla&s;ting fire pre|pared for the devil and his angels."</P>
<P>Again. From the certainty and circum&s;tances of a future judgment, how great mu&s;t be the ab&s;urdity of di&s;&s;imulation! On that day, "when the &s;ecrets of all hearts &s;hall be di&s;clo&s;ed," the hope of the hypocrite will peri&s;h. None of tho&s;e arts and &s;ubtilties which he once practi&s;ed in the world, and with &s;ucce&s;s, will then avail him. He will find no friend to ca&s;t the mantle of charity over his deceptions; nor any corner in which to hide his guilty face. He will appear be|fore his fellow creatures, and before the holy angels, in his true character, and be filled with &s;hame and remor&s;e. The greater his duplicity may have been, the greater will be his confu&s;ion and di&s;tre&s;s. He will then reflect on the value and importance of a good con&s;cience: and be ready to acknowledge, that there are no plea&s;ures comparable to tho&s;e which flow from a faithful performance of our re&s;pective duties, and from an heart which cannot reproach us.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="030424_0012_0FE6D1078DB1A168">Again. As the hopes given us in the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t are mo&s;t glorious, and its promi&s;es, re&s;pecting a future world, "exceeding great and precious;" not to extend our principal views towards futurity mu&s;t be the greate&s;t folly. More e&s;pecially, as our own feelings, and the circum&s;tances of all things about us, are continually &s;ugge&s;ting the infinite importance of it. This is the "one thing needful," and the greate&s;t concern we can po&s;&s;ibly attend to. So great is the di&s;proportion between things &s;piritual and things temporal, that we mu&s;t &s;ee where our intere&s;t lies, and cannot be ignorant of the part we &s;hould prefer. As we acknowledge, that the plea&s;ures of this world are precarious, inadequate to our expectations, and only for a &s;ea&s;on, it becomes us to "&s;et our affections on things above, not on things on the earth."</P>
<P>Further. Although the certainty and circum&s;tances of a future judgment mu&s;t &s;trike the wicked, when|ever they reflect upon them, with the utmo&s;t terror; they afford the greate&s;t comfort and con&s;olation to the righteous. There are &s;o many contending intere&s;ts in the pre&s;ent world, and the pa&s;&s;ions and appetites of men are &s;o &s;trong and violent, that the virtuous are often reproached, and cruelly treated: and &s;ometimes per&s;ecuted unto death. This was the ca&s;e with many of the primitive chri&s;tians in particular; and who endured the greate&s;t afflictions, and &s;uffered the mo&s;t grievous puni&s;hments, having "re&s;pect unto the rec|ompence of the reward." They comforted and &s;up|ported one another with the ble&s;&s;ed hope of everla&s;t|ing life&mdash;a future &s;tate of exi&s;tence, in which their integrity would be completely rewarded. "Our light
<PB N="15" REF="030424_0013_0FE6D11116CCCAC0">
affliction which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory. For we mu&s;t all appear before the Judgment &s;eat of Chri&s;t, that every one may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad."</P>
<P>The &s;ubject leads to many more very u&s;eful re|flections; but they cannot be pur&s;ued at pre&s;ent: And I &s;hall clo&s;e this di&s;cour&s;e, with an addre&s;s to the audience,&mdash;and to the criminal.</P>
<P>MY BRETHREN,</P>
<P>In the unhappy pri&s;oner now before you, &s;ur|rounded by the executive officers of ju&s;tice, and fa&s;t bound in the chains of death, you behold a mi&s;erable &s;inner; covered with &s;hame and &s;tung with remor&s;e: the u&s;ual and ju&s;t effects of a wicked and profligate life!</P>
<P>One end of the law, in ordering him to &s;uffer, in this public and ignominious manner, is to alarm and deter others&mdash;le&s;t they &s;hould come into the &s;ame condemnation. And if the &s;olemn tran&s;actions of this day &s;hould not touch, and powerfully affect your hearts, they mu&s;t be in&s;en&s;ible indeed!</P>
<P>And here, permit me to caution you, in great &s;eri|ou&s;ne&s;s, again&s;t tho&s;e vices in particular which lead more immediately to the crime for which this un|happy man is now to &s;uffer.</P>
<P>Among others, we may mention a barbarous and cruel temper. It mu&s;t be evident to tho&s;e who are acquainted with the human heart, that every <HI>kind,</HI> and every <HI>degree</HI> of cruelty practi&s;ed upon man or bea&s;t,
<PB N="16" REF="030424_0014_0FE6D111223AEC98">
le&s;&s;ens the influence of tho&s;e tender &s;en&s;ibilities im|planted in our nature for the mo&s;t benevolent purpo&s;es, and leaves impre&s;&s;ions on the mind unfavourable to the intere&s;ts of humanity. The per&s;on who can wan|tonly wound and torture a brute, and take delight in his &s;ufferings, will &s;oon become callous to the feelings of his fellow creatures. And &s;ociety can never be too &s;ecurely guarded again&s;t this brutal in&s;en&s;ibility of temper.</P>
<P>Further. All violent and head-&s;trong pa&s;&s;ions lead to this mon&s;trous crime: more e&s;pecially when they have acquired, which is often the ca&s;e, an irre&s;i&s;tible authority. A man thus en&s;laved is every moment liable to the mo&s;t &s;erious and affecting misfortunes.</P>
<P>And revenge, or a di&s;po&s;ition to redre&s;s our own wrongs, leads on to the mo&s;t fatal extremes. Every emotion of this pa&s;&s;ion, is pregnant with danger: and victims without number have been &s;acrificed to its ra&s;h and precipitate purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>But, the mo&s;t awful effects may be expected from a fixed rancor and malevolence of heart. This is the mo&s;t un&s;ociable and wicked temper that can po&s;&s;ibly po&s;&s;e&s;s a man. It is the temper of that degraded be|ing, "who was a murderer from the beginning." And "every <HI>man,</HI> who hateth his brother, is a murderer" al&s;o.</P>
<P>To the&s;e we may add avarice, gaming and di&s;&s;ipa|tion; which excite contentions and quarrels; expo&s;e per&s;ons to the &s;evere&s;t temptations; and tend to de|&s;troy all &s;en&s;e of moral obligations.</P>
<P>There is another vice extremely prejudicial and dangerous, as it leads to the heinous crime of perjury;
<PB N="17" REF="030424_0015_0FE6D112498E6940">
viz. ra&s;h and profane &s;wearing; which has a tendency to lower the Divine Being in our minds, and to take off that reverential awe which is our natural duty to our Creator.</P>
<P>And if we may credit the confe&s;&s;ions of many who have &s;uffered for the crime of murder, a di&s;regard to the &s;abbath, and to the public wor&s;hip of God, may be con&s;idered as ruinous to individuals, and highly injurious to the peace and welfare of &s;ociety. And this, I think, will hardly admit of a doubt, when we reflect, that the public exerci&s;es of our religion are calculated to keep up a lively and con&s;tant &s;en&s;e of God, and his providence, upon our minds; to impre&s;s our hearts with benevolent &s;entiments; and to e&s;tab|li&s;h the principles of &s;elf-government, by motives of pre&s;ent, and eternal happine&s;s.</P>
<P>And now let me intreat you, in the mo&s;t &s;erious and affectionate manner, to guard your&s;elves not only again&s;t the&s;e great and mo&s;t pernicious vices, but again&s;t every <HI>kind</HI> and <HI>degree</HI> of immorality.</P>
<P>If you believe in the exi&s;tence of a God, who governs the world in wi&s;dom and equity, and that you are accountable to him for your conduct, you have the &s;tronge&s;t motives to a religious and virtuous behavior that can po&s;&s;ibly be laid before you. But, as you &s;ee that the&s;e motives, great and powerful as they are, are often &s;uper&s;eded by the &s;olicitations of the tempter, attend to the fir&s;t advances of vice, which approaches &s;tep by &s;tep: "Fir&s;t the blade, then the ear, after that the full corn in the ear." Look upon every de|viation from the path of duty, however &s;mall, as un|ju&s;tifiable and wrong. Con&s;ider, that every irregular

indulgence leaves an impre&s;&s;ion on the mind unfavor|able to the intere&s;ts of virtue. It le&s;&s;ens the fear of &s;hame, that innate mode&s;ty which is the natural guard of innocence, and weakens the power of con&s;cience. Be per&s;uaded, that your duty and happine&s;s are in|&s;eparably connected; and avoid even "the appear|ance of evil."</P>
<P>And, may the in&s;piration of the Almighty govern your hearts!</P>
<P>I now turn to the criminal.</P>
<P>You, HENRY BLACKBURN, are this day to &s;uffer the pains and penalties of an ignominious death; for the unnatural and atrocious crime of MURDER: A crime of the highe&s;t nature; to which the law of God, and the laws of nations, have annexed this righ|teous, though awful puni&s;hment, "he that &s;heddeth man's blood, by man &s;hall his blood be &s;hed."</P>
<P>You have repeatedly prote&s;ted, and in the mo&s;t &s;olemn manner, by immediate appeals to heaven, that neither revenge, nor hatred, nor any other malig|nant pa&s;&s;ion, moved you to take away the life of the per&s;on who died in con&s;equence of the wound you gave him. But your country, after a mo&s;t deliberate, &s;olemn and impartial inquiry, has pronounced you <HI>guilty</HI>&mdash;and guilty of wilful murder. The matter re&s;ts with God and your own &s;oul; that God who cannot be deceived, and "who will not be mocked."</P>
<P>But, allowing that you had no de&s;ign again&s;t the life of the unfortunate &s;tranger, who fell a victim to your ra&s;hne&s;s and folly, this will not wipe away, although
<PB N="19" REF="030424_0017_0FE6D119CC84E138">
it may greatly extenuate your guilt. Life is a gift too &s;acred to be &s;ported with; and the weapons of death are not to be u&s;ed lightly and wantonly. And, although you may not have incurred the fearful guilt of <HI>wilful</HI> murder, this is certain, you have &s;hed the blood of a fellow creature; and in &s;uch a manner as cannot be ju&s;tified in the &s;ight of God, nor in the opinion of man.</P>
<P>During your confinement, which has been long and tedious, you have had time for the mo&s;t &s;erious and deliberate reflections: And you have been encouraged and a&s;&s;i&s;ted in the great duty of repentance. You have been per&s;uaded, "by the mercies of God, and by the terrors of the Lord," to repent, to for&s;ake your &s;ins, and to turn mo&s;t heartily unto God. And from the &s;olicitude which you early di&s;covered for in&s;truction, and from the apparently open and candid acknowledgments which you have made of the errors of your pa&s;t life, we have rea&s;on to hope, that &s;ome good fruits have been produced in your heart: but, if you have impo&s;ed on your &s;incere&s;t friends, and deceived your&s;elf, let me exhort you, in the mo&s;t &s;erious and pathetic manner, by the mercies of God, and by the affection which you bear to your own &s;oul, to renounce your hypocri&s;y this in&s;tant; to acknowledge your multiplied tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions with the deepe&s;t humility; and to turn unto God with your whole heart.</P>
<P>Within a few moments, you will be taken from the hou&s;e of God, carried to the place of execution, and "appear before the judgment-&s;eat of Chri&s;t, to receive the deeds done in your body, whether they be good
<PB N="20" REF="030424_0018_0FE6D119D7F99A90">
or bad." You have ju&s;t heard the certainty, cir|cum&s;tances, and de&s;ign of this judgment; and the pa&s;&s;ing interval before you mu&s;t awaken all the powers of your &s;oul! It is enough to overpower your &s;en|&s;ibility, unaccompanied and alone; and much more &s;o, attended by the habiliments of death, and by thou&s;ands of &s;urrounding &s;pectators.</P>
<P>O, my brother! thus encompa&s;&s;ed with the &s;orrows of the grave, and the &s;nares of death, you &s;tand in need of every con&s;olation. And, to a&s;&s;i&s;t and &s;upport you in this mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;&s;ing hour, and to &s;hew the part which it becomes you to perform, "look unto Je&s;us, the author and fini&s;her of our faith." It is true, the difference in point of character is infinite: For, al|though he died the death of a malefactor, he died perfectly innocent of every crime. <HI>He</HI> died to &s;upport the cau&s;e of piety and virtue, and to &s;ave &s;inners: but <HI>you</HI> will die a malefactor indeed&mdash;for your atro|cious crimes&mdash;becau&s;e you have di&s;regarded the prin|ciples of religion, and &s;hed the blood of one, whom he died to redeem.</P>
<P>Our ble&s;&s;ed Lord and Ma&s;ter endured the cro&s;s, de&s;pi&s;ing the &s;hame. And he &s;uffered that ignomini|ous and painful death with the mo&s;t perfect &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the will of his Father, with the mo&s;t heroic forti|tude and equanimity of mind, and in the exerci&s;e of a mo&s;t charitable and forgiving temper, even towards his enemies, and tho&s;e who per&s;ecuted him unto death, and who in&s;ulted him in his la&s;t agonies.</P>
<P>And you have the example of one, who was a great &s;inner, and who &s;uffered with him; and who&s;e faith was not to be &s;haken by all the terrors of a lingering,
<PB N="21" REF="030424_0019_0FE6D11C7018E1A8">
&s;hameful death. Although he &s;aw the Savior of the world nailed to the cro&s;s, and knew that he would expire within a few hours; yet he believed on him, and died entirely re&s;igned to the will of God. He died with chri&s;tian fortitude and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion; he died a &s;incere penitent; and he died in prayer&mdash;"Lord, remember me, when thou come&s;t into thy kingdom." And as a reward of his faith, penitence and obedience, Chri&s;t an&s;wered him, and &s;aid, "To-day &s;halt thou be with me in paradi&s;e." And O that you, my brother, may di&s;cover this believing, re&s;igned and heavenly temper, at the hour of your departure, and be admitted into the kingdom of the Great Redeemer!</P>
<P>Now, "unto God's gracious mercy and protection we commit thee; the Lord ble&s;s thee, and keep thee; the Lord make his face to &s;hine upon thee, and be gracious unto thee; the Lord lift up his countenance upon thee, and give thee peace, both now and ever|more."</P>
<P>Let us pray, &amp;c.</P>
