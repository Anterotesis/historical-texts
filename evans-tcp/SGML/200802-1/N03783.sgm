<HEAD><HI>A Letter from the Rev. Mr.</HI> Whitefield, <HI>to a Friend in</HI> London, <HI>&s;hewing the Funda|mental Error of a Book, entituled,</HI> The Whole Duty of Man.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear Friend,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SINCE it has plea&s;ed God to give me a true Knowledge of the Doctrines of Grace, I have frequently thought, that next to the fal|ling away of the Clergy from the Principles of the Reformation, the Books which are in our Church founded on the <HI>Arminian</HI> Scheme, have been the chief Cau&s;e why &s;o many of our own Communion in particular, have built their Hopes of Salvation on a fal&s;e Bottom. The Authors not only led the People Captive in their own Life Time, but al&s;o after their Death, like <HI>Simon Magus,</HI> for a long Sea&s;on have be|witched the People with their Sorceries; I mean their &s;eemingly devout, but at the Bottom Anti-Chri&s;tian, Compo&s;itions.</P>
<P>The only Way therefore, to open People's Eyes, I think is this: To &s;hew them that the Writings which for &s;ome Years pa&s;t, have been &s;o much admired, are directly contrary to the Go&s;pel of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> for this Rea&s;on, I thought it my Duty, to bear a publick Te&s;timony a|gain&s;t the Writings of Archbi&s;hop <HI>Tillot&s;on&punc;</HI>
<PB N="4" REF="004642_0003_100DB606B29806C0">
And upon the &s;ame Account, think it my Du|ty&punc; to point out the Fundamental Error of an Author as much admired and read by the more common, as the Archbi&s;hop by the more lear|ned and polite, &s;ort of People.</P>
<P>I know you are impatient to hear, who this can be: If you will promi&s;e me not to be an|gry, I'll tell you; it is that much admir'd Book called the WHOLE DUTY OF MAN. Methinks, I &s;ee you &s;urprized at the very men|tioning of it. But remember, I de&s;ir'd you not to be angry; and if you will throw a&s;ide Prejudice, and are &s;incerely de&s;irons to know and do the divine Will, I am per&s;uaded we &s;hall be both of one Mind concerning this Book, are you lay this Letter down out of your Hand.</P>
<P>But before I &s;hew you its Error, to convince you of my Impartiality, I confe&s;s, that the Devotions of that Book, were once of Service to me: And I believe have been u&s;eful to ma|ny others. The Book in general, is calculated to <HI>civilize,</HI> but I am per&s;uaded it never was a Means of <HI>converting</HI> one &s;ingle Soul. I have ju&s;t been looking over the Index and general Titles at the End of it, and cannot find the Word <HI>Regeneration</HI> &s;o much as once mention|ed; and indeed the whole Treati&s;e is built on &s;uch a fal&s;e Foundation, as not only proves the Author to be no real Chri&s;tian at Heart&punc; But
<PB N="5" REF="004642_0004_100DB608EF07CF68">
al&s;o, that he had not &s;o much as a Head-Know|ledge of the true Go&s;pel of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> To prove this, I need only refer you to part of the Preface, <HI>Of the Nece&s;&s;ity of caring for the Soul,</HI> (17th Paragraph) wherein the Au|thor talking of the &s;econd Covenant, &s;peaks thus: <HI>This &s;econd Covenant,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>was made with</HI> Adam <HI>and us in him, pre&s;ently after his Fall, and is briefly contain'd in tho&s;e Words, Gen. 3d, 15th, where God declares, that the Seed of the Woman &s;hall break the Serpent's Head; and this was made up as the Fir&s;t was, of &s;ome Mercies to be afforded by God, and &s;ome Duties to be performed by us.</HI> Who, that is any Way enlighten'd, cannot &s;ee the fal&s;e Divinity and Fundamental Errors of this Pa&s;|&s;age? For how can it be proved, that the &s;e|cond Covenant was made with <HI>Adam</HI>; or that God ever entered into any Covenant at all, with Man after he had broken the Fir&s;t? It is true, he did enter into a Covenant, (and that from all Eternity,) with the &s;econd <HI>Adam&punc;</HI> the God-Man <HI>Chri&s;t Je&s;us,</HI> in our Stead. But it cannot be proved that he made any &s;econd Co|venant at all with <HI>Adam</HI> him&s;elf, or any of his Po|&s;terity. But &s;ays our Author;
<Q>He did make a &s;econd Covenant with <HI>Adam,</HI> and us in him, pre&s;ently after his Fall, and it is briefly contained in the&s;e Words, <HI>Gen. 3d.</HI> &amp; 15th,
<PB N="6" REF="004642_0005_100DB60AA99DDAB8">
where God declares, that the Seed of the Woman &s;hall break the Serpent's Head.</Q>
But I would ask, where any Covenant is contained in the&s;e Words? And, how it is made up as the fir&s;t was, of &s;ome Mercies to be afforded by God, and &s;ome Duties to be performed by us? Here is a <HI>free Gift</HI> and Promi&s;e of Salva|tion made to <HI>Adam,</HI> but no Covenant, not a Word of any Condition mentioned. No, it was the free Gift of God in <HI>Chri&s;t. Adam</HI> was now in a State of Condemnation, he was &s;o far from being de&s;irous of entring into Co|venant with, that he fled from, God, and was not &s;o much as truly convicted of his Sin; as will evidently appear from the Context. For, both he and his Wife laid the Fault not upon <HI>them&s;elves,</HI> but one <HI>another</HI> and the <HI>Serpent. The Woman which thou gave&s;t me,</HI> (therein tacitly reflecting upon God, for giving him that Woman,) <HI>&s;he gave me,</HI> &s;ays Adam, <HI>and I did eat.</HI> Here appears no true Sen&s;e of Sin at all: and to &s;hew they had no Notion of a Sa|viour, we are told they &s;ewed Fig Leaves to|gether, in&s;tead of applying to God, to cover their Nakedne&s;s; and afterwards fled from God, when they heard the Voice of the Lord God walking among the Trees in the Garden. Here then opens the My&s;tery of Godline&s;s, God ma|nife&s;t in the Fle&s;h. Notwith&s;tanding our fir&s;t
<PB N="7" REF="004642_0006_100DB60E6A2F4D18">
Parents had broken the Covenant, and had their Hearts hardened; yet, out of the Riches of his <HI>free Grace,</HI> God had provided a Reme|dy from all Eternity, and now reveals it in Time. <HI>The Seed of this Woman,</HI> i. e. <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> (who in all Probability was &s;piritually conceived that In&s;tant in the Heart of <HI>Eve</HI>) <HI>&s;hall brui&s;e the Serpent's Head, i. e.</HI> by his O|bedience and Death, &s;hall &s;atisfy divine Ju&s;tice, fulfill the moral Law in Man's Stead, and thereby deliver him from the Power of the De|vil. Here are no <HI>Terms</HI> mentioned, on Man's Part at all. And &s;uppo&s;ing there had been a Co|venant made with Man, <HI>'And it had been made up as the fir&s;t was, of &s;ome Mercies to be afforded by God, and &s;ome Duties to be performed by us:</HI> Alas, we are of all Crea|tures the mo&s;t mi&s;erable; for then we are not under <HI>Grace,</HI> but under the <HI>Law.</HI> And if <HI>A|dam</HI> could not keep the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> Covenant, tho' in perfect Innocence; how can we, who hate God by Nature, and who&s;e Thoughts are only evil continually, keep a <HI>&s;econd</HI> like unto it? Is not this putting Man into a mo&s;t unhappy Condi|tion, and making his poor imperfect Obedience the <HI>Cau&s;e</HI> why <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> is merciful unto him? and if &s;o, how is boa&s;ting excluded in the great Work of our Redemption, as the Scriptures every where affirm? And how can Eternal

Life be the free <HI>Gift</HI> of God, thro' <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> our Lord? But this is agreeable enough to the Divinity of this Author, who in the Twen|ty-fir&s;t Paragraph of his Preface &s;ays; <HI>The Third Thing that</HI> Chri&s;t <HI>was to do for us, was, to enable us, or give us Strength, to do what God requires of us. This he doth, fir&s;t by taking off from the Hardne&s;s of the Law given to</HI> A|dam <HI>,which was, never to commit the lea&s;t Sin upon Pain of Damnation, and requiring of us only an holy and hearty Endeavour to do what we are able, and where we fail ac|cepting of &s;incere Repentance.</HI> Now, I would fain know, where God has taken off from the Hardne&s;s of the Law given unto <HI>Adam</HI>? And required of us only an holy and hearty Endea|vour to do what we are able? And, when we fail, accepting of &s;incere Repentance? This is all as fal&s;e, as God is true; the whole Law is as much, in Force again&s;t <HI>us,</HI> as it was again&s;t <HI>A|dam,</HI> before we are found in <HI>Chri&s;t.</HI> God has been &s;o far from taking off from the Hardne&s;s of the Law given to <HI>Adam,</HI> that <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> declares, that he came not to <HI>de&s;troy,</HI> but to <HI>fulfil</HI> it. And, until convinc'd of the Obliga|tion we lie under to obey the whole moral Law, in Thought, Word, and Deed, how can we &s;ee the Nece&s;&s;ity of the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t?</HI> God's Law was honourable, <HI>Je&s;us
<PB N="9" REF="004642_0008_100ECA069AD06528">
Chri&s;t</HI> fulfilled it in our Stead, and upon Account of that Righteou&s;ne&s;s <HI>imputed</HI> to us, and not on our hearty Endeavours or Repen|tance, are we accepted by him. What is there in our hearty Endeavour or Repentance, to re|commend us to the Favour of God, or render them worthy or being <HI>joined</HI> with the Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> as tho' <HI>that</HI> was not &s;uffi|cient in <HI>it&s;elf</HI>? Our be&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> are but <HI>Splen|dida peccata, glittering Sins. I cannot pray,</HI> &s;ays the pious Bi&s;hop <HI>Beveridge, but I Sin; I cannot hear or preach a Sermon, but I Sin; I cannot give an Alms, or receive the Sacrament, but I Sin; Nay, I cannot confe&s;s my Sins, but my very Confe&s;&s;ions are &s;till Aggravations to them: my Repentings need to be repented of; my Tears want wa&s;hing, and the very wa&s;hing of my Tears, need &s;till to be wa&s;hed over again with the Blood of my Redeemer,</HI> Je&s;us Chri&s;t, The Lord is our <HI>whole</HI> Righteou&s;ne&s;s, we are to go to him as poor Sinners. Beg Salvation of him as his <HI>free Gift,</HI> and entreat him to give us a living Faith, whereby that Righteou&s;|ne&s;s may be applied to our Hearts; and then that Faith, if true, will work by Love. This, the Author of the WHOLE DUTY OF MAN, was wholly ignorant of, otherwi&s;e he would not have laid &s;uch a Foundation: and if the Foundation be &s;o bad, judge you how wretchedly
<PB N="10" REF="004642_0009_100ECA0899080520">
weak, the Surper&s;tructure mu&s;t be. It would take more Time than I can at pre&s;ent &s;pare, to point out all the Mi&s;takes of the whole Book: I will only refer you to what this Author &s;ays about Recreations, Sunday, 19th, Sec. 7th wherein he &s;eems not only to allow of Gaming, by &s;aying, <HI>if we play at any Game,</HI> but di|rects us when we do it, to let <HI>the End of our doing it be meerly to recreate our&s;elves.</HI> I thought the Glory of God, and not <HI>&s;elf-plea&s;ing,</HI> had been the Principle from which all Chri&s;tians ought to act. I &s;uppo&s;e from this Pa&s;&s;age, a Man whom I reproved lately on the Road, for Gaming in the <HI>Chri&s;tmas Holy-Days,</HI> grounded <HI>his</HI> Autho|rity for &s;o doing: He told me, <HI>the Whole Duty of Man</HI> &s;aid, he might do &s;o And indeed I be|lieve he is not the fir&s;t by thou&s;ands, who have been mi&s;erably deceived, by this much applau|ded Book: And therefore I thought my&s;elf o|bliged to write this Letter. You may make what U&s;e you will of it. I care not if the Con|tents are publi&s;hed upon the Hou&s;e Top. Nay, I think it your Duty, if convinced your&s;elf, to endeavour to convince others; for there's no Hopes of bringing People to a right Knowledge of the Go&s;pel, till their Favourite, tho' erroneous, Au|thors are di&s;countenanc'd and laid a&s;ide. Before I &s;ee <HI>England,</HI> I hope I &s;hall hear that my dear Friends in the Mini&s;try, both in preaching and

printing have &s;econded my Te&s;timony. Future Ages as well as the pre&s;ent, will be much behol|den to them for it. Their Declarations will &s;tand as Records that God did not leave him&s;elf with|out Witne&s;s, even in the Wor&s;t of times. Other Go&s;pel Mini&s;ters will be much encourag'd there|by; and thou&s;ands, nay, ten thou&s;ands prefer|ved from Infection, which other <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> perhaps they may not be able avoid. However, whether they &s;econd me or not, by the Help of my God, both abroad and at Home, (if it be the Divine Will I &s;hould &s;ee <HI>England</HI> again) I will per&s;evere in bearing a more explicite and parti|cular Te&s;timony again&s;t the fal&s;e Writings of our admired <HI>Rabbies.</HI> Do you and my other Friends watch over me; reprove me &s;harply whenever you perceive my Spirit embitter'd. Pray that I may be as meek as a Lamb, and as bold as a Lion; and then whatever befalls me for &s;peaking as I ought to &s;peak, through divine Grace &s;hall be chearfully &s;ubmitted to by</P>
