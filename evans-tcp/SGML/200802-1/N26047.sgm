</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE de&s;ign of the Deity in &s;end|ing a Saviour into the world, who &s;hould adorn our nature by his example, reform us by his laws, and expiate for our crimes by his death, was &s;o va&s;t in its nature and important in its con|&s;equences, that none of the component parts of it, which are di&s;coverable by rea&s;on, are unworthy our notice. The curio&s;ity of a &s;peculative mind would of it&s;elf naturally excite an enquiry into every part of the Divine conduct unfolded by the works of creation, or the facred &s;criptures. But here the &s;trong and powerful motive of in|tere&s;t would be &s;uperadded, to awaken our con|templation on the mo&s;t wonderful event in the hi&s;tory of the intelligent world.</P>
<P>According to our ideas of power, wi&s;dom and greatne&s;s, we &s;hould naturally &s;uppo&s;e that the fir&s;t &s;cene, which introduced &s;o illu&s;trious a cha|racter
<PB N="6" REF="034645_0004_0FFF4507AAC28880">
as the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t unto the human drama, mu&s;t be grand and awful, and attended with every circum&s;tance of pomp and magnifi|cence, which could &s;trike the eyes and the &s;en&s;es, of men. This opinion would be warranted by a &s;acred precedent, the promulgation of the law from Mount Sinai. If on that occa&s;ion the mountain was covered with &s;moke, the thunders, the lightnings and the found of the trumpet oc|ca&s;ioned terror and di&s;may in the minds of tho&s;e people, on who&s;e account the&s;e divine energies were di&s;played, might we not infer that the effects of it in the natural world, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> would be proportionally more great and a&s;tonishing, when u&s;hering in a &s;till more glorious demon&s;tration of the Eternal to his crea|tures? In a word, that when the <HI> De&s;ire of all Nations</HI> made his appearance not figuratively, but literally, God would &s;hake the heavens and the earth, and fill, not only his temple at Jeru|&s;alem, but the whole earth with his vi&s;ible glory?</P>
<P>In the&s;e, however, as well as in our other rea|&s;onings on the government of God, we find that our mo&s;t plau&s;ible opinions are not always the be&s;t founded. Greatne&s;s and &s;implicity are near|ly allied. Objects, which dazzle at the fir&s;t, &s;oon become familiar to the eye. Like the &s;en&s;ible ho|rizon, they dimini&s;h in e&s;timation, on experiment and knowledge. Others, which appear minute and incon&s;iderable, upon a clo&s;er in&s;pection di&s;|cover marks of the deepe&s;t contrivance and pro|founde&s;t de&s;ign. The mo&s;t beautiful and magni|ficent fabric, that was ever reared by human hand, can by the eye of the ingenious arti&s;t be ea&s;ily traced from the ba&s;is to the &s;uper&s;tructure; while the origin of the &s;malle&s;t in&s;ect in the ani|mal
<PB N="7" REF="034645_0005_0FFF45092F121838">
or the arcana of the lea&s;t plant in the vege|table world, cannot be explained by the mo&s;t learned philo&s;opher. The rea&s;on is obvious.&mdash;The fir&s;t is a human, the &s;econd a divine pro|duction.</P>
<P>Corre&s;ponding with our la&s;t remarks, the birth of Je&s;us Chri&s;t was not attended with the fal&s;e glare of worldly glory and grandeur, nor with that pomp and o&s;tentation, which affect the ima|gination and &s;en&s;es of the weak and unthinking of mankind. On a review, however, of all the circum&s;tances which attended that event, it would not be difficult to demon&s;trate that the wi&s;dom of God in the moral and intelligent, is as much &s;u|perior to human calculations, as his &s;ublime and beautiful productions in the material creation are preferable to the monuments and beauties of art. For this cau&s;e the humble and retired village of Bethlehem was preferred to the populous and &s;u|perb city of Rome for the fir&s;t appearance of the Me&s;&s;iah. A manger, not a palace, was the fir&s;t &s;eene to which the fir&s;t and be&s;t of God's intel|ligent creatures was introduced. The unkind and inho&s;pitable temper of tho&s;e who were pre&s;ent as &s;pectators, was a pre&s;age of the ingratitude of that world which he came to redeem; while at his birth, the contra&s;t between heavenly honours and earthly deba&s;ement was an emblem of his future condition in the world&mdash;a &s;triking picture of a life made up of indigence, mi&s;ery and won|ders.</P>
<P>The Almighty, however, gave to mankind &s;ufficient indications of his divine agency in &s;o important an event as the nativity of the Redeem|er. The cele&s;tial me&s;&s;engers were directed to an|nounce tho&s;e joyful tidings to the &s;hepherds in the
<PB N="8" REF="034645_0006_0FFF450BBB0F3F58">
vicinity. Other occurrences equally remarkable engaged the attention of tho&s;e who, from the language of their ancient prophets, were waiting with anxiety for their patron and &s;aviour, and fully per&s;uaded that the au&s;picious aera was at hand.</P>
<P>The words of the text are a part of the me&s;|&s;age announced by the angel. They point out his birth, and de&s;cribe its effects. As my main de&s;ign is to &s;peak this day on the important ad|vantages that mankind have derived from the advent and mi&s;&s;ion of Chri&s;t, I &s;hall take the li|berty to invert the order of the ver&s;es in further pro&s;ecuting the &s;ubject.</P>
<P N="1">I. I &s;hall make &s;ome remarks on the wi&s;dom of Providence, that the birth of Chri&s;t &s;hould be circum&s;tanced in the manner related by St. Luke and another evangeli&s;t. <HI>For unto you is born this day a Saviour which is Chri&s;t the Lord.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. Take a &s;ummary view of the exten&s;ive ad|vantages which mankind have derived from the example of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and the princi|ples of his religion. <HI>Behold I bring you good tidings of great joy, which &s;hall be unto all people.</HI></P>
<P N="3">III. Offer a few reflections.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> I &s;hall make &s;ome remarks on the wi&s;|dom of Providence, that the birth of Chri&s;t &s;hould be circum&s;tanced in the manner related by St. Luke and another evangeli&s;t. <HI>For unto you is born, &amp;c;.</HI></P>
<P>Fir&s;t of all, the nation among whom he was born had been from remote antiquity favoured with a divine revelation; in which clear and &s;trong indications were given of the de&s;igns of
<PB N="9" REF="034645_0007_0FFF450D437B6738">
Providence re&s;pecting the redemption of mankind by Chri&s;t. To Abraham, the fir&s;t of the Patri|archs, it was declared, <HI>that in his feed all nations of the earth &s;hould be ble&s;&s;ed.</HI> To his two imme|diate de&s;cendants a promi&s;e of like import was uttered. To Mo&s;es, the great and in&s;pired law|giver of the Jews, it was foretold, that a prophet like unto himself &s;hould ari&s;e armed with plena|ry powers, for the propagation of true religion and moral virtue in the world. By the &s;ucceed|ing prophets, particularly I&s;aiah, not only the great and marvellous, but many of the mo&s;t mi|nute events of his life, as well as of the circum|&s;tances of his &s;ufferings and death, were predicted with hi&s;torical exactne&s;s. A people, who had &s;uch credentials of the divine promi&s;es, were not <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> the mo&s;t likely to receive the Me&s;&s;iah, but were the faire&s;t and fitte&s;t judges of his preten|&s;ions. For they had little el&s;e to do, but to in|&s;pect the in&s;pired language of their laws and pro|phets, and compare it with the accompli&s;hment in his life and actions. This cau&s;e may be ra|tionally a&s;&s;igned why, in the coun&s;els of Hea|ven, an ob&s;cure part of an ob&s;cure country was preferred, for the dawnings of the light of the world, to Greece, with her literary &s;ame, or Rome, with the &s;plendour and maje&s;ty of her conque&s;ts.</P>
<P>In the <HI>&s;econd place,</HI> the <HI>family,</HI> from which he de&s;cended afford us a remark &s;imilar to the la&s;t. Humble and depre&s;&s;ed in their fortunes, &s;o far as to be obliged at his birth to take advantage of the &s;acrifice cu&s;tomary for the poor; at the &s;ame time venerable for a long line of ance&s;tors, em|bracing both the &s;anctity of Patriarchs and the maje&s;ty of Kings. From the&s;e facts it is clear|ly
<PB N="10" REF="034645_0008_0FFF450ECC0ABF98">
evident, that wealth is of no con&s;equence in the &s;ight of God, and that he meant, to intro|duce. Chri&s;t and his go&s;pel independent of any human influence; at the same time it was order|ed by Providence, that nothing mean or degrading might take place in the nativity of so illu&s;trious a per&s;onage.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> The omens and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> attending his birth were ju&s;t indications of his character and errand to the world. The Star in the ea&s;t was a harbinger of the Sun of Righteou&s;ne&s;s. The anx|ious enquiry of the wi&s;e men implied, that a &s;y&s;|tem of truth and righteou&s;ne&s;s was wanted to in|&s;truct mankind, notwith&s;tanding <HI>the wi&s;dom of the world.</HI> The pacific manner in which he was in|troduced to the world; quadrated with the hum|ble temper and benevolent; conduct di&s;played in every part of his private life or public mini&s;try. The cruel jealou&s;y of Herod was the fir&s;t accom|pli&s;hment of tho&s;e in&s;pired predictions, which an|nounced him to be <HI>a man of &s;orrows,</HI> from the cradle to the cro&s;s, while his divine pre&s;ervation from the de&s;igns, of that tyrant was a pre&s;age of the &s;ucce&s;s of his go&s;pel again&s;t the cla&s;hing in|tere&s;ts and corrupt morals of the world.</P>
<P>A <HI>fourth</HI> ob&s;ervation which occurs, is, the fit|ne&s;s and prosperity of that preci&s;e period of time a&s;&s;igned for his birth. The A&s;&s;yrian, the Per|&s;ian, and the Grecian monarchies had been &s;wal|lowed up by the Roman power. Profound peace was e&s;tablished in all parts of the civilized world. From the cau&s;es la&s;t mentioned, it was a ta&s;k nei|ther difficult nor dangerous to travel from one country to another. It was an age which has been renowned for the progre&s;s of urbanity, and of the arts and &s;ciences. The ine&s;timable re|mains
<PB N="11" REF="034645_0009_0FFF451473493A08">
of ancient literature, the &s;ublime efforts of genius which have &s;carce ever been equalled, and we are &s;ure have never been exceeded by any na|tion or individual from that aera to the pre&s;ent, amply qualified that generation to detect fal&s;e|hood and impo&s;ture. For had the prejudices of the Jews been &s;uch as to admit a deceiver from the hopes of national grandeur; &s;till they were but an inferior, weak province of a foreign go|vernment. Had Chri&s;t appeared at an earlier date, the divi&s;ion of mankind into &s;mall govern|ments, independent of each other, and mutually ho&s;tile, would have required as con&s;tant prodi|gies in the whole proce&s;s, as were wrought at the fir&s;t promulgation of the go&s;pel. The general expectation of both Jews and Gentiles that a prince and lawgiver was &s;oon to ari&s;e, who &s;hould govern the earth, prepared their minds for the reception of the Chri&s;tian &s;y&s;tem, and its Author. Had God longer delayed his gracious de&s;igns, their expectations would have langui&s;hed for want of their completion. It was therefore in the ful|ne&s;s of time that God &s;ent forth his Son. By the convul&s;ions and revolutions which preceded that event, the words of his holy prophet were fulfilled. <HI>Every valley &s;hall be exalted, every mountain and hill &s;hall be made low, the crooked &s;hall be made &s;trait, and the rough places plain. The glory of the Lord &s;hall be revealed, and all fle&s;h &s;hall &s;ee it together.</HI></P>
<P>The incidents already enumerated, ju&s;tify the observations of a learned and ingenious author on the re&s;urrection, which we think will equally ap|ply to the nativity of Chri&s;t, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> that <Q>God, in unfolding his purpo&s;e to the world, differed widely in his operations, from what would
<PB N="12" REF="034645_0010_0FFF4515F83678F0">
have been expected or calculated by human &s;agacity.</Q> That by a &s;overeign act of power he could have &s;ubdued the whole human race to his law and will, there is no manner of que&s;tion. But, by adopting a different method, he has &s;hown that his di&s;pen&s;ations in the order of grace &s;hall co-operate with his natural providence, and the &s;ettled laws by which rational, free agents are governed. In con&s;equence of this arrange|ment, the &s;entiment of St. Paul was fully ju&s;tifi|ed, <HI>the weakne&s;s of God is &s;tronger, and the fooli&s;h|ne&s;s of God is wi&s;er than man.</HI> By in&s;truments apparently the mo&s;t feeble; from cau&s;es the mo&s;t improbable, he has di&s;played the &s;tronge&s;t tokens of his goodne&s;s to mankind. He hath be&s;towed the mo&s;t valuable legacy (with deference be it &s;poken) which it was in his power to confer on the work of his hands.</P>
<P>Of the truth of the la&s;t a&s;&s;ertion we &s;hall be &s;ufficiently per&s;uaded, from the ob&s;ervations which will occur in the &s;econd head of di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P N="2">II. Let us take a &s;ummary view of the advan|tages, which mankind have derived from the ex|ample of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and the principles of his religion. <HI>Behold I bring you good tidings of great joy, which &s;hall be unto all people.</HI></P>
<P>Here we may make a pertinent enquiry, what changes have taken place in the religion, mo|ral habits and cu&s;toms of men, in con&s;equence of the coming of Chri&s;t, and at the &s;ame time de|mon&s;trate the &s;uperiority of the motives to piety and &s;ocial virtue, which are derived from our holy religion.</P>
<P N="1">1. To the go&s;pel mankind are indebted for that fir&s;t and grand article of all true religion, the UNITY OF GOD. This truth had not only been
<PB N="13" REF="034645_0011_0FFF451780F1AF18">
ob&s;cured, but obliterated by idolatry. Although the religion of the Jews, as delivered by Mo&s;es, made this a principal and po&s;itive article in their creed; yet their frequent relap&s;es into the idolatry of other nations, and the very unworthy notions of the di|vine attributes, that were admitted among their traditions, prove that they, as well as all the re&s;t of human kind, &s;tood in need of a teacher, who, by a divine warrant and by divine authority, &s;hould give them a proper view of the &s;ubject. Granting this to be the ca&s;e, with a people fa|voured with a pure though partial revelation of the Deity, we may very naturally conclude, that in nations and countries walking by the light of nature, it would be far wor&s;e. Hi&s;tory confirms us in this &s;uppo&s;ition. For not merely the heaven|ly bodies, the &s;un, moon and &s;tars; but decea&s;ed princes and heroes, benefactors or tyrants of mankind, yea the bea&s;ts of the field, and the in|animate parts of creation, received tho&s;e honours which are alone due to the Governor of heaven and earth. Who can reckon up the number of human victims, which were &s;acrificed, either to procure their favour, or to appea&s;e their wrath? Was there a pa&s;&s;ion or appetite, however black or polluted, lurking in the heart of man, but re|ceived a religious con&s;ecration, and was made a part of divine wor&s;hip? The ears of the cha&s;te would be wounded at the recital of the impure and abominable, tho&s;e of the humane and com|pa&s;&s;ionate, with that of the infernal barbarities of the pagan rites. A bare allu&s;ion to many of them would be too indecorous for an a&s;&s;embly of Chri&s;|tians. Such facts did however exi&s;t, as to ju&s;ti|fy the de&s;cription of them by St. Paul in his epi&s;|tles. <HI>Profe&s;&s;ing them&s;elves to be wi&s;e they became
<PB N="14" REF="034645_0012_0FFF45190582A118">
fools, their fooli&s;h hearts were darkened, they were given up to a reprobate mind, they changed the glo|ry of the invi&s;ible God, to the likene&s;s of corruptible man, to bea&s;ts, to birds and reptiles.</HI> As far therefore, as the primitive religion of nature, which comprizes the idea of one God, and him infinitely powerful, wi&s;e and good, is preferable to the <HI>abominations of the heathen,</HI> with all their brutal and barbarous modes of wor&s;hip; as far as mankind have been enlightened in the&s;e doctrines by the go&s;pel, &s;o far I affirm we are indebted to the birth and mini&s;try of Je&s;us Chri&s;t for the light and knowledge we enjoy. We &s;hall offer no other argument in favour of our la&s;t a&s;&s;ertion, than by a&s;king, in the language of a late learned and eminent writer,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Thomas Sherlock, Bi&s;hop of London.</HI></NOTE><Q>In what nation, city or even village, has the doctrine of one eternal God been publicly taught, except among the Jews, previous to the commencement of Chri&s;|tianity?</Q></P>
<P N="2">2. The &s;tate of the heathen morality, compar|ed with that of the go&s;pel, will give us a further view of the &s;uperior advantages we enjoy. The belief that we are accountable to a being, who is infinitely pure and holy, who will reward the mo&s;t &s;ecret acts of goodne&s;s, and puni&s;h vice whether &s;ecret or open, is I &s;ay common to eve|ry denomination of Chri&s;tians, however they may differ from each other in modes of wor&s;hip. To do ju&s;tly, to love mercy, and to walk hum|bly, to do to others as we would that others &s;hould do to us, to forgive our enemies, and, as far as is con&s;i&s;tent with &s;elf pre&s;ervation, to re|&s;tore them to our affections, to harbour no ma|lignity in our hearts, neither to envy the rich, nor
<PB N="15" REF="034645_0013_0FFF451AAB932AA8">
de&s;pi&s;e the poor, to vi&s;it the afflicted, the friend|le&s;s and the de&s;titute, and relieve their nece&s;&s;i|ties, to conduct in every relation of life as a good neighbour and a good citizen, to be &s;evere and critical in examining our own conduct, to exer|ci&s;e charity, candour and moderation to all others, the&s;e are truth, which were taught by the pre|cepts, and exemplified in the life of our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour. Compare for a moment the principles and morals here laid down, with tho&s;e of the heathen world, where revenge was in many places con&s;idered as a virtue, where patrioti&s;m was but a faction again&s;t the liberty and happine&s;s of eve|ry country but their own, where men were in no capacity to learn truth or purity of conduct from their laws, from their philo&s;ophers, or from their &s;ocial in&s;titutions, where the violation of virtue or decency was &s;carce thought worthy of a &s;light reproof, much le&s;s of a legal prohibi|tion, where every crime again&s;t the peace of &s;o|ciety or individuals could be ju&s;tified from the ex|ample of their Gods.</P>
<P>I am aware it will be objected, that the writings of many eminent men among the heathen recom|mended the practise of the &s;ocial virtues, and exhibited &s;ublime &s;entiments of piety, in &s;ome re|&s;pects not inferior to tho&s;e delivered in the New Te&s;tament. But in reply, it may be &s;aid, that their influence and authority was greatly circum|&s;cribed, and there was &s;uch a mixture of the re|ligious traditions of their country, as rendered it impo&s;&s;ible that any general body of ethics &s;hould be collected from them. We do not wi&s;h to de|preciate their characters. We admire the efforts of their minds, labouring under &s;o many di&s;ad|vantages. That the academy at Athens and the
<PB N="16" REF="034645_0014_0FFF451F6D93F800">
public &s;chool at Sparta produced men of &s;hining parts and romantic virtues, we do not deny; but let us look for a moment into the private manners of their be&s;t di&s;ciples; how very remote were they from uniform morality! In one in&s;tance we know that the government of the civilized world was left to one of the mo&s;t eminent philo&s;ophers of all antiquity. Yet when &s;upreme power was united with the highe&s;t degrees of human wi&s;dom and dignity of character, that it produced no ge|neral change for the better. It &s;carcely clean&s;ed the polluted atmo&s;phere of the court.</P>
<P N="3">3. Let us con&s;ider the alteration in human laws and cu&s;toms, by the propagation of the go&s;pel.</P>
<P>Under the heathen &s;y&s;tem, &s;lavery or death was the u&s;ual con&s;equence of being vanqui&s;hed in war. This warranted the mo&s;t internal cruelty in the conqueror, and the mo&s;t ob&s;tinate re&s;i&s;t|ance in the vanqui&s;hed. But the go&s;pel, by the doctrine of forgiving enemies, recommending them as objects of our love, has &s;oftened the &s;e|rocious pa&s;&s;ions of men, changed the &s;tern coun|tenance of war, and in an infinity of examples bettered the condition of mankind. It has made good the preten&s;ions of its divine Author, who declared, that he came to bring deliverance unto the captives, the opening of the pri&s;on to them that were bound, and to loo&s;e tho&s;e that were ap|pointed unto death. Equally &s;alutary were the con&s;equences of the go&s;pel, by which polygamy was aboli&s;hed, and the affections and &s;en&s;es of men re&s;trained within &s;uch limits, as from their tendency, promote friend&s;hip, mutual confidence, and the care of po&s;terity.

of lawle&s;s appetites, by rendering the &s;tate of mar|riage honourable and mutually advantageous, the &s;ource of innumerable private ble&s;&s;ings; where every man's home would be an a&s;ylum amid&s;t the cares and trials of life, where he might find the partner and companion of his heart in&s;tead of the &s;lave of &s;en&s;ual appetite.</P>
<P>I add, that the con&s;tituion of the go&s;pel is highly favourable to the abolition of per&s;onal &s;la|very. Its mo&s;t &s;acred my&s;teries are communicat|ed equally to the rich and poor, to the ma&s;ter and &s;ervant. The &s;entiment that every man is ac|countable for his actions at the tribunal of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, that no di&s;tinctions will be admitted but tho&s;e of a moral nature, the doctrine delivered by the holy apo&s;tle St. Paul, <HI>that in Chri&s;t there is neither bond nor free, but all one,</HI> could not but have made a deep impre&s;&s;ion, and procured a de|ci&s;ive influence on all, who embrace that holy &s;y&s;tem, to treat all mankind as brothers. It mu&s;t from its tendency have inculcated the principles of liberty and equality, &s;o far as they can exi&s;t con&s;i&s;tently with order and the &s;ocial compact.</P>
<P>In addition to tho&s;e la&s;t mentioned, may we not a&s;cribe to our holy religion the benefits which ari&s;e from literature, commerce and re&s;inement, which have rendered Chri&s;tian countries &s;o far &s;uperior to the other parts of the globe? The care and pains with which the in&s;pired writings were pre&s;erved, rendered the original languages, in which they were written, ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to be known, and the duties of devotion per|formed in the Latin language throughout Europe for many generations, were means in the hands of Providence for pre&s;erving the noble compo&s;i|tions

of the ancients from de&s;truction, under the great eclip&s;e of literature by the inva&s;ion of the Goths and Vandals in the We&s;t, and the Scythi|ans and Arabs in the Ea&s;t, who effected the de|&s;truction of the Roman Empire. Otherwi&s;e, for any cau&s;e we can a&s;&s;ign, the arts and &s;ciences would have been buried in the ruins of the Ro|man government. The civilized parts of Europe would have known no re&s;urrection of literature, but would in all probability have been as barba|rous and brutal, as tho&s;e nations on the extremi|ty of A&s;ia or America, which have been vi&s;ited by modern navigators.</P>
<P N="4">4. Let us con&s;ider the &s;uperior motives, by which we are excited to moral virtue under the go&s;pel, to what were ever laid before mankind previous to that di&s;pen&s;ation. The doctrine of par|don upon penitence, the &s;ufficency of the Sav|iour's expiation to compen&s;ate for our imperfect nature, and to rai&s;e us to a &s;phere of exi&s;tence far beyond what the mo&s;t perfect innocence could have hoped for from natural religion, have their origin in the New Te&s;tament. But, le&s;t &s;uch indulgence &s;hould be a foundation for licentiou&s;|ne&s;s, and counteract the purity of the Chri&s;tian doctrines, we are a&s;&s;ured that the Supreme Being will admit none to his favour, till, &s;ubdued by divine grace, and clothed with humble reliance upon his goodne&s;s, both their hearts and habits are changed.</P>
<P>But among all the vi&s;ible effects of the go&s;pel, none are more worthy our grateful commemo|ration, than the doctrine of the immortality of the &s;oul, and the re&s;urrection of the dead. Hu|man laws and penalties from large experience are

proved to be in&s;ufficient either to encourage the good or to awe and reclaim the wicked, unle&s;s aided by the hopes and fears of another life, in which reward and puni&s;hment will be adju&s;ted, not according to the promi&s;cuous plan of Provi|dence in this &s;tate, but by the everla&s;ting princi|ples of truth and righteou&s;ne&s;s. In this there|fore man in a &s;ocial view has reaped innumerable benefits from the coming of Chri&s;t. What might be con&s;idered a probability from the natural hopes of mankind, and the writings of great and good men not in&s;pired, in con&s;equence of the evidences and light of our holy religion, may be viewed as a moral certainty. If in the pre&s;ent mixed &s;tate all things come alike to all, and there is one event to the righteous and to the wicked; if the &s;inner be clothed in purple and fare &s;umptuou&s;|ly every day, and the true child of virtue is de|prived of the common bounties of heaven, our holy religion a&s;&s;ures us, that in a very &s;hort time this &s;cene will be &s;hifted, the former will be com|forted, the latter puni&s;hed. Vice will be &s;tripped of its fal&s;e ornaments and its crown. Per&s;ecuted, conflicting, and per&s;evering goodne&s;s will be re|&s;erved to adorn the triumph of the Redeemer at the great day. The&s;e hopes of our holy religion have bani&s;hed the fears of &s;ilence and perpetual &s;leep. They teach us, that He, who was rai&s;ed from the dead, will illuminate us through the dark valley of the &s;hadow of death, and intro|duce us to the paternal man&s;ions he had prepar|ed, where are collected the wi&s;e and good of all pa&s;t ages, who&s;e numbers will con&s;tantly aug|ment to the conclu&s;ion of time.

nece&s;&s;ary are they for the unfortunate? If they are a &s;timulus to virtue, are they not &s;till more wanted as a check upon the wicked?</P>
<P>Here, my brethren, you &s;ee a &s;mall part of the glorious events, that have taken place in con&s;e|quence of the birth and advent of the Redeemer to the world. Might not the cele&s;tial me&s;&s;enger, more e&s;pecially when unfolding the dark volumes of futurity, he fore&s;aw the &s;plendour of the &s;pi|ritual throne of David, and tho&s;e ble&s;&s;ings to the human kind which originated from the go&s;pel, be ju&s;tified in declaring, <HI>I bring you good tidings of great joy, which &s;hall be unto all people.</HI> Well might his cele&s;tial attendants re&s;pond to his &s;enti|ments, <HI>glory to God in the highe&s;t, peace on earth, and good will towards men.</HI> Well might the aged and venerable prophet, in&s;pired with more than mortal joy, &s;ing his "nunc dimittis:" <HI>Permit thy &s;ervant to depart, for mine eyes have &s;een the &s;alvation, which thou ha&s;t prepared before the face of all people.</HI></P>
<P>I now ha&s;ten, in the <HI>third</HI> place, to offer a few reflections.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Something will be expected concerning the religious fe&s;tival it&s;elf. A que&s;tion of this kind will naturally ari&s;e in your mind, why, if the birth of Chri&s;t be attended with &s;o many ad|vantages to mankind, &s;hould not this day be ho|noured with religious &s;olemnity? Wherefore have our ance&s;tors of the New-England &s;tates, who founded our churches, refu&s;ed it that honour and notice paid by all other Chri&s;tians? In reply, un|der patience and candour of the audience, I &s;hall give you &s;ome among the more important of their objections, adding at the &s;ame time &s;ome &s;enti|ments of my own.</P>
<Q><PB N="21" REF="034645_0019_0FFF452D899FDA18">
<P>In the fir&s;t place,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The&s;e objections I have &s;tated in my own language, from reading and recollection.</NOTE> the day has never been identified with &s;uch correctne&s;s, as to warrant its ob&s;ervation, Were we to determine by the time in which Zacharias officiated in the tem|ple, we could gain no light upon the &s;ubject, becau&s;e the order and rank of prie&s;ts were va|ried at the plea&s;ure of the Roman Governors. In the next place, all their public records pe|ri&s;hed with their temple. Should it be com|puted by the Roman cen&s;us, when Cyrenius was pre&s;ident of Syria, that period is placed by &s;ome expo&s;itors at an earlier &s;ea&s;on of the year. To the la&s;t objection may be added another; that of <HI>&s;hepherds feeding their flocks by night.</HI> Though Pale&s;tine be in a climate much warmer than our own, yet &s;uch an employ|ment was improbable at that late &s;ea&s;on of the year. To this perhaps their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors would add, that the reformation of the calendar half a century ago, has cau&s;ed a variation of eleven days in the time of its celebration.</P>
<P>They further objected, that the fe&s;tival is enjoined neither by Chri&s;t nor his apo&s;tles in any part of the New Te&s;tament, that there are no traces to be found of it in the early and pure ages of the church; from whence they drew this inference, that at an after period it was &s;ub&s;tituted for &s;ome pagan fe&s;tival, after the church had become corrupt.</P>
<P>They con&s;idered it as a fe&s;tival enjoined by human authority, and therefore, as they di&s;|puted all preten&s;ions of that kind, as invading
<PB N="22" REF="034645_0020_0FFF4530343E4480">
the kingdom of Chri&s;t, they on that account refu&s;ed it any particular notice or honour.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, it is probable, from the rigour and &s;everity of their principles, they might di&s;like the manner in which it was ob&s;erved by the ig|norant and unthinking part of the community, and might therefore view it as productive of di&s;&s;ipation and indecent mirth, and con&s;equent|ly ho&s;tile to the intere&s;ts of piety and virtue.</P></Q>
<P>The&s;e arguments have been recited rather to gratify the hearers than with a view or wi&s;h for polemical di&s;cu&s;&s;ion. The greater part of them at the pre&s;ent day, con&s;idering the mutual good &s;en&s;e of tho&s;e who deny or admit their weight, are of very little con&s;equence. I conceive the fame|ne&s;s of the day is given up on all hands by the pre&s;ent Gregorian calendar. Good men we are &s;en&s;ible may differ in their opinions how far a power enjoining a po&s;itive act of wor&s;hip, unex|ceptionable in it&s;elf, may be lodged in the church. But at the &s;ame time, however different their ap|prehen&s;ions of the lawfulne&s;s of the authority, they may all perform the &s;ame acts of wor&s;hip from different motives. Some may view the cele|bration of this day as an act of piety, becau&s;e it has its origin in venerable antiquity, and is &s;up|ported by the example of the greater part of the Chri&s;tian world. Others, from voluntary effu|&s;ion of gratitude to the memory of Chri&s;t. A third party, having no objections to offer, may e&s;teem it a mark of charity and catholici&s;m to unite in the devotion of their fellow Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>If it be admitted by the candid and moderate of both parties, that &s;ome day &s;hould be &s;et apart for this purpo&s;e, I think we may infer, that the
<PB N="23" REF="034645_0021_0FFF4531EBC1B8A0">
practice of the churches of England and Geneva, the Prote&s;tant churches in Germany, the Greek churches in A&s;ia and Europe, which la&s;t com|prize the religion of the Ru&s;&s;ian Empire, &s;hould give a decided preference to the pre&s;ent time.</P>
<P>For my own part, though I have the highe&s;t veneration for the founders of the New-England churches, yet I conceive it may be po&s;&s;ible that, with hearts filled with piety, they might vi|brate to an extreme in le&s;&s;er matters. As a mere <HI>human</HI> and compul&s;ive injunction, I &s;hould pro|te&s;t again&s;t the ob&s;ervation of the day. But as a free-will-offering to the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, as a voluntary honour to the &s;ea&s;on of his birth, I could heartily wi&s;h, that every temple con&s;ecrat|ed to the mo&s;t high God throughout the land were opened to commemorate, with proper &s;en&s;i|bility and fervent gratitude, the benevolence of the Deity in &s;ending a Saviour. Certainly the thou&s;ands, nay millions of &s;incere Chri&s;tian pro|fe&s;&s;ors, engaged in this holy act of devotion and piety, would warm and elevate our religious af|fections. For ju&s;t is the ob&s;ervation of the wi&s;e man, <HI>iron &s;harpeneth iron, &s;o a man &s;harpeneth the countenance of his friend.</HI></P>
<P>In the <HI>&s;econd place,</HI> the day it&s;elf may lead us to &s;ome collateral reflections on the advantages of &s;uch religious in&s;titutions as occa&s;ion plea&s;ure to the mind, and admit of &s;ome entertainment to the &s;en&s;es. It may be ju&s;tly offered in their de|fence, that when limited by a &s;trict veneration for religion and its Author, re&s;trained by deco|rum from &s;en&s;ual exce&s;&s;es, when they neither are allowed to promote idolatry, or tre&s;pa&s;s on the calls of common life, they de&s;erve reverence and
<PB N="24" REF="034645_0022_0FFF4535D02898C0">
attention not only from the devout man, but even from the good citizen. The Deity in the ab&s;tract is too &s;ublime for our conceptions. His original cannot be inve&s;tigated by the mo&s;t pro|found thought or elevated powers of the human &s;oul. We therefore form our ideas of him from the noble&s;t images of created excellence; from the be&s;t moral and intelligent qualities of the mind. The&s;e, though infinitely &s;hort of his e&s;&s;ence, yet are nece&s;&s;ary aids to a&s;&s;i&s;t us in the duties of piety. For <HI>who can by &s;earching find out God, who can find out the Almighty to perfec|tion? It is high as heaven, what can&s;t thou do? Deeper than bell, what can&s;t thou know? The mea&s;ure thereof is longer than the earth, and broad|er than the &s;ea.</HI> The Almighty, therefore, in exhibiting him&s;elf to his creatures, has conde|&s;cended to the pre&s;ent frame and condition of man. Accordingly he manife&s;ted him&s;elf to his ancient people by vi&s;ible demon&s;trations of his power. To Adam under the repre&s;entation of a man walking in the garden in the cool of the day; to Mo&s;es and the people of I&s;rael by a pil|lar of light; and afterwards to the &s;ame people by the Shechinah, which was a &s;ymbol of his power and pre&s;ence, re&s;iding between the Che|rubims. La&s;t of all, he manife&s;ted him&s;elf to mankind by his Son, <HI>the brightne&s;s of his glory,</HI> de&s;igned as a very picture of him&s;elf, through which they might adore him. From the&s;e facts we in&s;er, that though idolatry is ju&s;tly to be re|probated, yet from the nature of mankind, re|ligion ought, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, to be adapted to the &s;en&s;es. And we are ju&s;tified in this ob&s;er|vation by the words of the apo&s;tle, <HI>wherein he
<PB N="25" REF="034645_0023_0FFF453756142150">
directs, to glorify God not only with our &s;pirits, but with our bodies which are his.</HI></P>
<P>Social wor&s;hip, the ob&s;ervation of the Sabbath, Bapti&s;m, and the Lord's Supper, are e&s;&s;ential, in the pre&s;ent order of nature, for the pre&s;ervation of the Chri&s;tian &s;y&s;tem. We therefore find each of the&s;e &s;trictly enjoined, either by precept or example, in the New Te&s;tament. Our annual Fa&s;ts and Thank&s;givings, con&s;idered as volunta|ry homage to the Supreme Being, deprecating his di&s;plea&s;ure, &s;oliciting his protection, and ac|knowledging his pa&s;t goodne&s;s, are not venera|ble merely for being coeval with the &s;ettlement of the country; but are cu&s;toms wi&s;e and good in them&s;elves. Very few are there, who are &s;o capable of contemplation, as to &s;upport internal religion, if all public forms &s;hould be laid a&s;ide. Of the&s;e, none are more plea&s;ing than &s;uch as awaken a cheerful gratitude to God, or lead us to meditate on &s;uch parts of the divine conduct, as are in the highe&s;t degree intere&s;ting to our|&s;elves.</P>
<P>This &s;ubject is more important, than we &s;hould at fir&s;t &s;uppo&s;e. For it may be an enquiry wor|thy of wi&s;e and good men, whether the gloomy medium, through which religion has been viewed by many in the land, hath not had a tendency to promote in&s;idelity or de&s;pair? Whether it may not have been productive of the horrors of fanat|ici&s;m, ari&s;ing from the mo&s;t unworthy notions of the divine character, on the one hand; or on the other, of that irrational exuberant enthu&s;ia&s;m, &s;o ho&s;tile to order and decency in public wor&s;hip; <HI>the parent of confu&s;ion and every evil work?</HI> Were I compelled to choo&s;e, I &s;hould rather adopt a
<PB N="26" REF="034645_0024_0FFF453AEF394F48">
religion admitting as &s;acred rites &s;ports and pa&s;|times perfectly innocent, than one holding up to view our <HI>Heavenly Father</HI> as an implacable ty|rant, enacting laws impo&s;&s;ible to be obeyed, and for their <HI>nece&s;&s;ary</HI> violation, inflicting puni&s;hments un&s;peakably &s;evere, infinitely di&s;proportional, and terrible beyond conception; and, furthermore, repre&s;enting his favour as conciliated by no other means, than by &s;acrificing, to what is bla&s;phem|ou&s;ly &s;tiled his glory, the love of our proper nature implanted in us by him&s;elf, and by a cheerful acquie&s;cence in &s;uffering <HI>the vengeance of eternal fire</HI> to expiate the unpardonable crime of our exi&s;tence.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> The plea&s;ing union of different de|nominations of Chri&s;tians in the &s;olemnities of the day leads me to remark, that the variety of <HI>&s;ects</HI> in the Chri&s;tian world, although con&s;idered as a defect, are e&s;&s;ential, in the pre&s;ent order of things, for the pre&s;ervation of religion and morality. Did our nature and circum&s;tances admit, nothing would be more grateful to a pious mind, than that all the children of Adam, with one mode, heart and tongue, &s;hould pay their devout ac|knowledgments to their common Parent and Be|nefactor. But from dear bought experience we find, that all attempts to introduce uniformity in matters of religion have not only been ineffi|cient, but productive of infinite evils in &s;ociety. <Q>A variety of religious denominations may, for aught we know, be the mo&s;t &s;uitable to the un&s;earchable nature of the Deity.</Q> It is mo|rally certain, however, that it is a nece&s;&s;ary check on &s;uper&s;tition, and promotes a laudable emula|tion among different &s;ects to rival one another
<PB N="27" REF="034645_0025_0FFF453D8B744BF8">
in animated devotion, and purity of conduct. If a &s;ingle &s;ect, however pure and hone&s;t in their intentions, &s;hould prevail &s;o far as to exclude a toleration of others, it would &s;oon re&s;emble a great body of &s;tagnant water, which, by becom|ing corrupted, emits polluted air and pe&s;tilential vapours. The pure principles of Chri&s;tianity would become contaminated by a communication with the intere&s;ts of this world. The churches might encrea&s;e in the &s;plendour of their appearance, but internal piety and the maje&s;ty of holine&s;s would vani&s;h. The generous and liberal provi|&s;ion, devoted for the purpo&s;es of public in&s;truc|tion, would eventually become the exclu&s;ive pat|rimony of pride, indolence, and intere&s;t with the great, in&s;tead of the rewards of true godline&s;s, &s;trict morality, and literary labour.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> While we contemplate the ble&s;&s;ings which have flowed from the birth of the Saviour, let us not forget to prai&s;e God for the light and knowledge of the pre&s;ent day, for the reforma|tions in religion by reducing it to its primitive &s;im|plicity. Within two centuries what a happy change! The iron hand of per&s;ecution is not on|ly maimed, but we hope &s;tricken off from the trunk. The United States of America are add|ed to the li&s;t of Chri&s;tian nations, who, to the ble&s;&s;ings of religion in its native &s;implicity, have added &s;uch free and glorious con&s;titutions of civil government, as have exhibited the highe&s;t point to which human felicity can be carried. The mo&s;t free and rational enquiries on civil and reli|gious &s;ubjects are not only allowed, but invited. The four, un&s;ocial &s;pirit of bigotry is obliged to lay a&s;ide its former in&s;olence, and di&s;gui&s;e its
<PB N="28" REF="034645_0026_0FFF45401E57B340">
nature, or retreat to the habitations of ignorance and folly. And it is with plea&s;ure I can an|nounce, that the liberal and catholic &s;pirit among Chri&s;tians of different opinions at the pre&s;ent day, reflects high honour on our common go&s;pel. We feel, and may we ever feel its ble&s;&s;ed effects! Let us then lay a&s;ide all bitterne&s;s, and even cool|ne&s;s and &s;hyne&s;s to one another; like <Q>brethren of the &s;ame family of different chri&s;tian names.</Q> Let our only zeal and emulation be, to excel each other in piety, and in the practice of tho&s;e virtues that embelli&s;h and dignify human life.</P>
<P>Our own age has been pregnant with won|ders. From cau&s;es little contemplated, the mo&s;t &s;urprizing revolutions have taken place in the old world. Already &s;uper&s;tition has fallen from her ba&s;is. On her ruins has been erected the &s;hort but abominable dominion of athei&s;m. The vota|ries of the former we hope will be convinced by their intercour&s;e with foreign countries, that they have &s;een Chri&s;tianity through a fal&s;e medium. The advocates of the latter have, by a dreadful experiment, been convinced of the&s;e eternal truths, <HI>that man was made to wor&s;hip God, and that &s;ociety cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t without religion.</HI></P>
<P>But however the&s;e important commotions may operate on the minds of men in tho&s;e parts of the globe where they exi&s;t, I &s;incerely pray they may have a tendency to excite in us a love and reverence for the religious in&s;titutions of our country. Look to the effects of that piety and tho&s;e manly virtues for which our venerable an|ce&s;tors were renowned. Behold them in the nu|merous and beautiful fabrics erected to the ho|nour and wor&s;hip of God, in our univer&s;ities, in
