<Q>&mdash;Take heed what you do: For ye judge not for Man, but for the LORD, who is with you in the Judgment.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_ALTHO' civil Government be of divine Right, yet the various and different Forms of it, are of humane Right: And among the various Forms, one is cal|culated for a People under &s;uch and &s;uch Circum&s;tances; another for a People under different Circum|&s;tances. <HI>I&s;rael</HI> of old was a while under the government of Judges, and then under a king|ly Government: And their Happine&s;s or Mi|&s;ery was not &s;o much owing to the different form of Government they were under, as to their Governours or Rulers: When they had wi&s;e, prudent, &s;kilful and religious Rulers, they were very Happy; but when they had Rulers
<PB N="2" REF="005785_0004_1026EBEF1DEE0C60">
of another Character, they were Mi&s;erable. Upon which account the wi&s;e Man king Solo|mon, thus declares, in Eccl. 10. 16, 17. <HI>Wo to thee, O Land, when thy king is a Child, and thy princes eat in the Morning. Ble&s;&s;ed art thou, O Land, when thy king is a &s;on of Nobles, and thy princes eat in due &s;ea&s;on, for &s;trength and not for drunkenne&s;s.</HI> Among the good Kings of Judah, &s;tands on &s;acred Record <HI>Jeho&s;aphat,</HI> concerning whom it is &s;aid, That he walked in the way of <HI>A&s;a</HI> his Father, and departed not f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">m it, doing that which was right in the &s;ight of the LORD. And altho' he mi&s;&s;ed it in &s;ome things; as in joining with <HI>Ahab</HI> again&s;t <HI>Ramoth-Gilead;</HI> for which the prophet <HI>Jehu</HI> &s;harply reproved him in the&s;e words, ver. 2. <HI>Shouldest thou help the Ungodly, and love them that hate the LORD?</HI> Yet there were good Things found in him: He had taken away the Groves out of the Land, and had prepared his Heart to &s;eek the LORD: He was a religious King, and took care of the religious, as well as civil Intere&s;t of the Government; as appears from his going out from time to time among his People from one end of the Kingdom to the o|ther, to bring them back unto the LORD God of their Fathers. Three things are taken notic&eacute; of,</P>
<P N="1">1. His bringing back the People from their Idolatry, fal&s;e Wor&s;hip and wickedne&s;s of Life unto the LORD God of their Fathers.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="3" REF="005785_0005_1026EBF0EB5B0F60">
2. His appointing Judges and placing them in all the Cities of <HI>Judah,</HI> to whom the Peo|ple might go for Ju&s;tice and have all their va|luable Enjoyments &s;ecured to them.</P>
<P N="3">3. His charging his Judges to be Faithful in the great &amp; important Tru&s;t repo&s;ed in them; &s;aying to them, Thus &s;hall ye do, in the fear of the LORD, faithfully &amp; with a perfect heart.</P>
<P>And here in the Text, that good King <HI>Je|ho&s;aphat</HI> is brought in as giving In&s;truction &amp; Caution to tho&s;e Judges he had plac'd in <HI>Judah,</HI> Take heed what ye do, for ye Judge not for Man, but for the LORD, &amp;<HI>c.</HI> In which words are three Things ob&s;ervable.</P>
<P N="1">(1) The In&s;truction and Caution given, <HI>Take heed what ye do.</HI> The form of Speech was mo&s;t &s;uitable to wake up their Fear, the mo&s;t wakeful Pa&s;&s;ion GOD has planted in the chil|dren of Men: As if he had &s;aid, Ye Judges whom I have plac'd in <HI>Judah,</HI> Con&s;ider and be afraid; for ye have &s;omthing to do which calls for your greate&s;t Care and Circum&s;pection in doing of it: Enter upon your work &amp; bu&s;ine&s;s with the greate&s;t Caution that you may'nt do ami&s;s.</P>
<P N="2">(2) The Grounds and Rea&s;ons of the Cau|tion, <HI>For ye Judge not for Man, but for the LORD.</HI> As if he had &s;aid, You are not to aim at the plea&s;ing of Men, as the mark and &s;cope of your Judgment; but of GOD, who&s;e Cau&s;e
<PB N="4" REF="005785_0006_1026EBF3DDCCA598">
you have undertaken, in the indi&s;pen&s;ible mea|&s;ures of Right and Truth.</P>
<P N="3">(3) The Argument or Motive to enforce this Care and Caution in the Judges, <HI>GOD is with you in the Judgment.</HI> As if he had &s;aid, Ye Judges, if ye take heed what you do, Judge for GOD, He will be with you, a&s;&s;i&s;ting and enabling of you to judge Aright; for GOD &s;tandeth in the congregation of the Mighty.</P>
<P>DOCT. <HI>That the Judgment is for the LORD, is a Con&s;ideration of great Importance, to make civil Rulers act as they ought in that great and important Tru&s;t repo&s;ed in them.</HI> Or in other words, <HI>All men that are inve&s;ted with civil Power and Authority, &s;hould take heed what they do; becau&s;e they Judge not for Man, but for the LORD.</HI></P>
<P>Such &s;hould enter upon the Bu&s;ine&s;s with &s;erious Thought and Con&s;ideration, judge and determine with Caution and Care, for the Judgment is for the LORD.</P>
<P>I am &s;en&s;ible that the&s;e words were &s;poken to the executive Authority, the Judges in <HI>Ju|dah,</HI> and not to the Legi&s;lature; but the grounds and rea&s;ons of the In&s;truction and Caution gi|ven to them, hold good, are equal, if no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> greater with re&s;pect to the Legi&s;lature of a Go|vernment, and &s;o to all others in proportion to

the &s;hare they have in the Admini&s;tration of public Ju&s;tice; and accordingly I &s;hall Con|&s;ider them. And here,</P>
<P>I. I &s;hall Inquire what we are to under&s;tand by this, That the Judgment is for the LORD. <HI>Or,</HI> What it is to Judge for GOD?</P>
<P>II. Shew what a weighty Con&s;ideration this is to excite and &s;tir up civil Rulers to act up to their Character and Obligation in that great and important affair of Judgment.</P>
<P>I. <HI>What are we to under&s;tand by this, That the Judgment is for the LORD?</HI> Or, <HI>That Rulers Judge for GOD?</HI></P>
<P>And by Judgment which our Text &s;aith is for the LORD, we are to under&s;tand the great, weighty and important Bu&s;ine&s;s which this ho|nourable Legi&s;lature, is by and by to proceed upon, <HI>viz.</HI> the Admini&s;tration of Ju&s;tice in all its Acts and Offices; this is the great civil Af|fair, yea, the mo&s;t weighty &amp; important Affair &amp; Bu&s;ine&s;s of the Government: And our Text let's us know, that it is a religious Affair, and the very Bu&s;ine&s;s of GOD; Ye Judge for the LORD. And the&s;e things are intended in it,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>That the Legi&s;lature of a Government de|rive their Power and Authority from GOD; and this power of Judgment is GOD's Right.</HI> Every Legi&s;lature is ve&s;ted with a Judicial
<PB N="6" REF="005785_0008_1026EBF7D0246A70">
Power; otherwi&s;e how could they Delegate it to others? But this Right they derive not from any humane Title, but originally from GOD. Our ble&s;&s;ed Lord and Saviour JESUS CHRIST, has &s;et this matter in a very clear Light, from his own Ca&s;e; when <HI>Pilate</HI> the <HI>Roman</HI> Judge &s;aid unto him, <HI>Knowest thou not, that I have power to Crucifie thee; and al&s;o power to Relea&s;e thee?</HI> Chri&s;t makes this Re|ply, <HI>Thou couldst have no power at all against me, except it were given thee from above, (Joh.</HI> 19. 10, 11.) From above another: Not from <HI>Rome,</HI> but from Heaven. It's true, the Power was from <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> immediately, but &s;ontably &amp; originally from GOD. And altho' this Legi&s;la|ture receives its Authority from the People im|mediately; being Elected &amp; Cho&s;en by them, yet from GOD originally: Upon which account the civil Magi&s;trate is &s;aid to bear the Sword, Rom. 13. 4. <HI>For he is the mini&s;ter of GOD to thee for good. But if thou do that which is evil, be afraid; for he is the mini&s;ter of GOD, a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doth evil.</HI> Now the Sword is an En&s;ign of Power&punc; and imports a Juri&s;diction extending over Life: And he bears it not in vain; that is, He has a right to u&s;e it. But how comes the civil Magi&s;trate by this Juri&s;diction over Life? For no Man has this right in him&s;elf: No man hath power over his own Life; how then can
<PB N="7" REF="005785_0009_1026EBF9842ED0E8">
he give Power to any other over it? He can|not do it. I own a man may forfeit his Life by his Crimes and Wickedne&s;s: But when he has done &s;o, who has a right to take the For|feiture? The man him&s;elf hath not; neither can he render it lawful for any other to take it away: But he that bears the Sword for that purpo&s;e has the only Right, becau&s;e he is the Mini&s;ter of GOD, inve&s;ted with GOD's Autho|rity, and acting in his Right, who is the only LORD of Life: Upon which account they are in Scripture &s;aid to Rule and Reign by Him; that is, by his Authority &amp; as his Vicegerents. Prov. 8. 15, 16. <HI>By me kings reign, and princes de|cree ju&s;tice. By me princes rule,</HI> &amp; <HI>nobles, even all the judges of the earth.</HI> And for this Rea&s;on the civil Magi&s;trate is honoured in Scripture with the &s;tile of GOD's acting in GOD's Right: P&s;al. 82. 1, 6. <HI>GOD &s;tandeth in the congrega|tion of the mighty, He judgeth among the gods. I have &s;aid, Ye are gods: and all of you are children of the most High.</HI> In this re&s;pect the civil Magi&s;trate is &s;aid to Judge for the LORD, as he derives all his Right and Authority from GOD originally.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>All tho&s;e Matters and Ca&s;es which fall under the Cognizance of the Legi&s;lature, are pro|perly GOD's Cau&s;e.</HI> All things that are intrin|&s;ically Moral, involving good or evil in their own Nature; &s;uch as concerns Truth, Right,
<PB N="8" REF="005785_0010_1026EBFBF1B5EBF0">
Equity, Mercy; and all the contrary Violati|ons that proceed from Malice, Fal&s;hood, Un|faithfulne&s;s, as they were matters of GOD's Laws, before they were of Man's: And hu|mane Laws in re&s;pect of the&s;e are only the Tran&s;cript of that which is Divine &amp; Eternal; they are properly GOD's Cau&s;e. I think there can be no doubt about this; but that in all Ca&s;es where the matter under Determination appertains to natural Right, the Cau&s;e is GOD's Cau&s;e: And when Laws are enacted about things that are in their own Nature good or evil, they do directly belong to GOD's Cau&s;e, by antecedent Relation: And when indifferent Things are made matter of humane Laws, they become GOD's Cau&s;e by E&s;pou&s;al; and GOD will have our Obedience approved in indifferent Things, as well as nece&s;&s;ary; and both are charged upon the Con&s;ciences of men by the Apo&s;tle; and both are to be ob&s;erved for the &s;ake of GOD: And in ca&s;e of failure, the Ani|madver&s;ion upon tho&s;e that do not ob&s;erve them, is no le&s;s than a Judgment executed in GOD's behalf, for they are all GOD's Cau&s;e.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>To Judge for the LORD, intends and com|prehends this in it, That the very End or I&s;&s;ue of the Judgment, is GOD's End.</HI> It is for the maintenance of the Laws, the &s;ecuring mens Rights, the encouraging of Vertue, and the e&s;tabli&s;hing of Peace and good Order among
<PB N="9" REF="005785_0011_1026EBFE4BB52D58">
Mankind. As GOD has a Providence whereby he governs the World; &s;o the end of that Pro|vidence is a Series of &s;everal Methods to make men good; to which end this of humane Judg|ment is conducing in a very eminent manner: For there is no doubt, but Judgment is the greate&s;t external Bond of humane Vertue, and the mo&s;t effectual Check of di&s;orderly Pa&s;&s;ions. Were it not for humane Laws &amp; Government, this World would &s;oon be an Aceldama, a field of Blood; all manner of Crimes and Wicked|ne&s;s would Reign: But humane Laws guard men from doing Ill by a whol&s;om Fear; and the civil Magi&s;trate is a Terror to evil Doers&punc; And by being &s;o, they do prepare men to re|ceive the Go&s;pel. The re&s;traints which hu|mane Laws lay upon the children of Men, is a great preparatory to the Salvation of GOD; it prepares the way of the LORD, I&s;a. 56.1. <HI>Thus &s;aith the LORD, Keep ye Judgment, and do Ju&s;tice: for my Salvation is near to come, and my Righteou&s;ne&s;s to be revealed.</HI> As if he had &s;aid, According to the ordinary cour&s;e of things, GOD could not Reign where the Government did not a&s;&s;ert him. He may in compa&s;&s;ion (as one &s;aith) hover over a People; but he can never pitch his Tent and dwell among them, unle&s;s the civil Magi&s;trate fix him a Throne, by looking to that point which St. <HI>Paul</HI> calls the very end of Magi&s;tracy, viz. <HI>To be a Terror to</HI>
<PB N="10" REF="005785_0012_1026EC0171D6B678">
<HI>evil doers, and a Prai&s;e to them that do well.</HI></P>
<P>But here it will be Objected, <HI>Had not GOD a Church in the World, and the most glorious Church that ever was in the World, without the Care and A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the civil Magi&s;trate? And what mu&s;t the civil Government a&s;&s;ert him, and as it were fix him a Throne?</HI></P>
<P><HI>I An&s;wer,</HI> Tho' it be &s;o, that GOD had a Church &amp; the mo&s;t glorious Church that ever was in the World, without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance, care or help of the civil Magi&s;trate; yet this don't ren|der the Magi&s;trates help, a&s;&s;i&s;tance &amp; care need|le&s;s now; becau&s;e that was in an Age of vi&s;i|ble Miracles, and at a time when the World &amp; the Church &s;tood notoriou&s;ly Di&s;tingui&s;hed, and while tho&s;e that were of the Church were kept &s;o humble by Per&s;ecution, and mortified by Poverty, and &s;ober by the daily expectation of Death, that they needed no other Laws to re&s;train their corrupt Appetites and di&s;orderly Affections and Pa&s;&s;ions; but now the World is become Chri&s;tian, Religion in high Credit, and men can maintain their temporal Hopes and their chri&s;tian Profe&s;&s;ion together: And there|fore the Tares will choak the good Seed, unle&s;s the civil Magi&s;trate &s;tep in to weed and pluck up and a&s;&s;i&s;t in the Cultivation of the Field. It therefore follows that the very end of Judg|ment is GOD's end; it is to Reform degenerate Men and to make them live quiet, peaceable, hone&s;t &amp; godly Lives in this World.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="11" REF="005785_0013_1026EC0484F5A358">
4. <HI>To Judge for GOD, intends that the very Sentence pa&s;&s;ed by the Legi&s;lature, is GOD's Sen|tence.</HI> The Sentence of Judgment by all dele|gated Powers, is the Sentence of him or them from whom the Power is delegated or derived. Thus the Sentence pa&s;&s;ed in our executive Courts, is the Sentence of him or them, from whom the Power is derived; &s;o the Sentence of Judgment by the Legi&s;lature is GOD's Sen|tence, when the Legi&s;lature, who are GOD's Vicegerents, judge &amp; determine in matters and ca&s;es, according to Right, as they ought to do: And in this re&s;pect it may be &s;aid, as P&s;al. 50. 6 <HI>GOD is Judge him&s;elf;</HI> becau&s;e delegated Pow|ers act for Him here in this world; and he re|cognizes and imputes that Sentence, and takes it into his own Account. When GOD &s;hall Judge the World in Righteou&s;ne&s;s, it will be by the LORD JESUS CHRIST, to whom all Power and Authority in Heaven and Earth is delegated by GOD the FATHER: And the rule of Proceeding in that Day (as the Scrip|ture avouches) &s;hall be this, Men &s;hall reap as they &s;ow; and he that hath done wrong, &s;hall receive for the wrong that he hath done. Now the very &s;ame being the Rule of humane Tri|bunals, we mu&s;t look upon the Sentence given by them as GOD's Sentence.</P>

<P N="1">(1) <HI>The civil Magi&s;trate must take care of the publick Peace of the Government, That men live</HI> Peaceably <HI>one among another.</HI> I &s;uppo&s;e none will deny this to be part of their Work &amp; Bu&s;ine&s;s: They are the Guardians of Peace. The Apo&s;tle, in 1 Tim. 2. 1, 2, 3. <HI>Exhorts that &s;upplication and prayer,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>be made for Kings, and all in Authority, that we may lead a quiet and peaceable Life in all godline&s;s and hone&s;ty; for this is good</HI> &amp; <HI>acceptable in the &s;ight of GOD our Saviour.</HI> This is a Prayer for the civil Magi&s;trate, That GOD would di&s;po&s;e them to, furni&s;h them with, and pro&s;per them in, a due di&s;charge of their Office; that they would take care that tho&s;e under their Government live Quietly and Peaceably. Indeed the pre&s;ent &s;tate of humane Pravity; Mens proud Appe|tites and injurious Pa&s;&s;ions, has made Govern|ment nece&s;&s;ary, with all its Arts &amp; In&s;truments of Coercion; &s;o nece&s;&s;ary that humane Society cannot po&s;&s;ibly Sub&s;i&s;t without it: Yea, &s;o ne|ce&s;&s;ary, that the mo&s;t tyrannical Government that ever was in the World, is more Eligible than Anarchy, or no Government; becau&s;e
<PB N="13" REF="005785_0015_1026EC091AB94348">
while the Government is never &s;o Tyrannical, that Tyranny can only expre&s;s it &s;elf in the E|normities of a Few; the Multitude mu&s;t in the mean time be kept within the bounds of Right and Rea&s;on: whereas in ca&s;e of no Govern|ment, every one is a Tyrant and let loo&s;e to act the &s;ame In&s;olences and Wrongs. If the pub|lick Peace be not maintained, the Government it &s;elf will moulder &amp; go to ruin: For as So|ciety cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t without Government, &s;o neither can Government &s;ub&s;i&s;t without Peace. It is an Aphori&s;m of unque&s;tionable truth, that a Kingdom divided again&s;t it &s;elf cannot &s;tand: And a Kingdom is divided again&s;t it &s;elf, by publick Tumults and Rebellions in it.</P>
<P>One thing that rai&s;ed the <HI>Roman Government</HI> to &s;uch a pitch of glory in the World, was, their maintaining the public civil Peace among them; it was pre&s;erved with the utmo&s;t Care: For altho' they were a people Martial &amp; Brave, yet they e&s;teemed it Infamous to fight a fellow Citizen, in&s;omuch that Duelling was a way of vindication perfectly Scandalous among the <HI>Romans:</HI> And when any point of Honour en|gaged any of them to re&s;ent a particular Indig|nity, their only Challenge was to &s;hew, who was the be&s;t Man at the head of an Army a|gain&s;t their Enemy. Thus careful was the <HI>Roman Government</HI> to maintain the publick Peace, which if it be not maintained &amp; &s;ecured,
<PB N="14" REF="005785_0016_1026EC0B75296BB8">
the Intere&s;t of a Government will unavoidably &s;ink and come to ruin.</P>
<P N="2">(2) <HI>It is the duty of the civil Magi&s;trate, to take care that men live</HI> Hone&s;tly; <HI>yea, make them live Hone&s;tly.</HI> Hone&s;ty is not only oppos'd to Fraud, Violence, breach of Contracts, &amp;<HI>c.</HI> all which are immediate di&s;turbers of the pub|lick Peace, but to all manner of Vice: And therefore Peace cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t without <HI>Hone&s;ty</HI> in this Latitude. There is no kind of Vice, but what is in effect an Enemy to public Peace. Some Vices are de&s;tructive to Peace directly and at hand; &s;ome only at a di&s;tance and by remoter influence: But yet they are all a Poi&s;on in a Government, that tends to its Di&s;&s;olution and Ruin. Some Vices embroil a Government by invading mens Rights; &s;ome by grounding Animo&s;ities, and &s;ome by getting Factions: Some Vices expo&s;e to Enemies from abroad, by enervating mens Spirits, ema&s;culating and effeminating their Minds, whereby they be|come weak and defencele&s;s. Thus every Vice is in its own Nature de&s;tructive to the Peace &amp; Happine&s;s of civil Government: Therefore the Magi&s;trate mu&s;t make men live Hone&s;tly as well as Peaceably. This was what the <HI>Roman</HI> Government took the utmo&s;t care of: We find in the Hi&s;tory of it, that their Reputation ob|tained all over the World, as a People of the mo&s;t exemplary Hone&s;ty, &s;o that to &s;peak or

Hence it is, that even athei&s;tical Politi|cians advi&s;e their Princes, to take e&s;pecial care of Religion, and to &s;ee it Rooted as firmly as po&s;&s;ible in the hearts of their People, how &s;lender hold &s;o ever it has of their own. It is well known, that the flouri&s;hing State &amp; Condition of the <HI>Roman</HI> Common-wealth was owing to their &s;tudious Regard to <HI>Religion;</HI> this was the Source and Bond of all tho&s;e Ver|tues which they practi&s;ed, and by the practi&s;e of which they became &s;o very Famous &amp; Re|nowned in the World. <HI>They</HI> had &s;uch a regard to Religion, that if any man among them was ob&s;erved to live Loo&s;ely and Viciou&s;ly, <HI>He</HI> fell under a civil Excommunication: For the Law of their twelve Tables, prohibited all &s;uch from Joining in the publick Wor&s;hip, 'till &s;uch time as they could bring Te&s;timony of their better Behaviour: And &s;uch an intire Veneration did they pay to their reputed Gods, that they &s;hew'd more Concern for their Temples, than for their own Hou&s;es, Families or Fortunes. And this glorious Advance both of Vertue and Piety, proceeded from the direct influence of their Government, which had provided Laws ex|tending to all In&s;tances of good Manners, and
<PB N="17" REF="005785_0019_1026EC132B8FB008">
for a Fence to tho&s;e Laws, Guarding and En|forcing them. The fir&s;t Law in their twelve Tables was, <HI>Divos Ca&s;t&eacute; adeunto,</HI> Let men wor&s;hip the Gods with temperance of Body and purity of Mind. And yet the happine&s;s of their State did not owe it &s;elf &s;o much to their Laws, as to their Magi&s;trates; therefore good Care was taken that the Execution of their Laws &s;hould be committed to grave, ho|ne&s;t, active Men; and that they might be Faithful, they were obliged to ju&s;tifie their Admini&s;tration, by bringing into the publick Cen&s;or, from time to time, an account of what particular Acts they had done in order to the Maintaining &amp; A&s;&s;erting their Laws. (It would be well if this Practi&s;e was held up in all Go|vernments.) And concerning this order of Men, their Law provided this Caution, <HI>Is ordo vitio Caveto, Caeteris &s;pecimen e&s;to;</HI> Let that Order be men of un&s;tained Probity, and Ex|amples of that Behaviour which they require from others. And thus while the Reins of the Government were held in &s;teady Hands, the great Ble&s;&s;ings of Peace, Hone&s;ty &amp; Godline&s;s were enjoyed, and that Common-wealth for &s;everal Centuries &s;tood in that high pitch of Glory to which it was rai&s;ed by the pure Wi&s;|dom of the Government.</P>

But, alas! we find men make no difficulty to trample upon the Laws of CHRIST, notwith&s;tanding the Venerablene&s;s of their Au|thor, and the Moment of their Sanctions: For altho' their Sanctions are &s;o Important, yet the Execution of them is Remote.

<P N="2">(2) <HI>To you that Inform and Te&s;tifie in Ca&s;es that are brought before any Judicatories or Tri|bunals, you &s;hould take Heed what you do, for you act for GOD, and have a con&s;iderable Influ|ence upon the Judgment.</HI> Remember this, <HI>You Judge for GOD.</HI> All Corruption or Fal&s;hood in Evidence is a &s;olemn Evil: It is a great and amazing Affront to the GOD of Truth, e&s;pecially con&s;idering that GOD him&s;elf is called to be Wit|ne&s;s to the Affront: And be&s;ides, by Corruption &amp; Fal&s;hood in Evidence, a wrong Judgment is given, whereby the guilty go Unpuni&s;hed, and the innocent is made to Suffer wrongfully.</P>
<P>IV. <HI>I Addre&s;s my &s;elf now to the People of this Government, e&s;pecially tho&s;e Pre&s;ent in this A&s;&s;em|bly.</HI> We have heard, Brethren, that civil Rulers
<PB N="31" REF="005785_0033_1026EC34FAF78138">
are inve&s;ted with Authority from the great GOD; they Judge for him, and he is with them in the Judgment: Therefore we &s;hould be careful not to <HI>&s;peak Evil of them,</HI> or inclined to find Fault with them in their Admini&s;trations; They are but Men &amp; not Infallible: but, yet in as much as GOD has honoured them with being <HI>his Mi|ni&s;ters of Ju&s;tice for our good,</HI> &s;o we &s;hould ho|nour them by Submitting to their Decrees and Laws in every thing wherein the Laws of our Creator don't forbid our compliance; but where it doth, we <HI>mu&s;t Obey GOD rather than Man.</HI> But the rule of Law with re&s;pect to the Legi&s;la|ture, is, <HI>Turpe est impo&s;&s;ible.</HI> GOD has guarded them by his own Law, Exod, 22. 28. <HI>Thou &s;halt not revile the Gods, nor cur&s;e the Ruler of thy People.</HI> There is an ill Character given of tho&s;e that are Enemies to Government; tho&s;e that are always Murmuring, Complaining and finding Fault with Rulers, Jude 8, 16. <HI>Al&s;o tho&s;e filthy dreamers, defile the Fle&s;h, de&s;pi&s;e Dominion, &amp; &s;peak evil of Dignities. The&s;e are Murmurers, Com|plainers, walking after their own Lu&s;ts.</HI> Such are numbred with the wor&s;t of Sinners, and their Crimes &s;tand in the Catalogue of the blacke&s;t Sins. And we &s;hould carefully &amp; con&s;cientiou&s;ly &s;hun this Evil: And in&s;tead of finding Fault with them, we &s;hould Pray for them, that <HI>they may not bear the Sword in vain;</HI> but <HI>be Terrors to evil-doers,</HI> and <HI>a Prai&s;e to them that live peace|ably, hone&s;tly &amp; godly.</HI> If that Breath was &s;pent in
<PB N="32" REF="005785_0034_1026EC382233D818">
Praying for them, which is &s;pent in finding Fault with them in their Admini&s;trations, it would be better for us; we &s;hould di&s;cover more of the Chri&s;tian, and not le&s;s of the Polititian. And as we ought to Pray for them, &s;o we ought to be Obedient to them: And when we are call'd to give in our Suffrages for our Rulers, we &s;hould chu&s;e able Men, <HI>Men that under&s;tand the Times,</HI> and the be&s;t Maxims of Government; Men firm in their Principles, and &s;teady in their Practi&s;e, <HI>not given to Change,</HI> or to&s;s'd about with a giddy Multitude, upon every fit of <HI>Enthu&s;ia&s;m.</HI> A Pilot &s;hould hold the Helm &s;teady in a &s;tormy Day, or the Ship will &s;oon be lo&s;t. And tho&s;e that have done well among us, <HI>done good in our I&s;rael, known among our Tribes,</HI> to be men of Integrity &amp; Skill, who like <HI>David</HI> of old, have <HI>fed us according to the integrity of their Hearts,</HI> and <HI>guided us by the &s;kilfulne&s;s of their Hands,</HI> &s;hould be the Men that our eyes are upon to be our Rulers. And if we are careful &amp; con&s;cientious in our Duty, we may hope &s;till to enjoy our va|luable Privileges, <HI>Civil &amp; Sacred</HI> inviolate: And the great Ble&s;&s;ing which GOD promi&s;ed to his People of old upon their Obedience, &s;hall &s;till be enjoy'd by us, <HI>That our Nobles &s;hall be of our &s;elves, and our Governours &s;hall proceed from the midst of us: and they &s;hall Judge the People with Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and the Poor with Judgment; and in their days &s;hall the Righteous flouri&s;h, &amp; abun|dance of Peace &s;o long as the Moon endureth.</HI></P>
