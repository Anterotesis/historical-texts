<Q>He di&s;appointeth the devices of the crafty, &s;o that their hands cannot perform their enterprize. He taketh the wi&s;e in their own craftine&s;s: and the coun&s;el of the froward is carried headlong. They meet with darkne&s;s in the day time, and grope in the noon day as in the night. But he &s;aveth the poor from the &s;word, from their mouth, and from the hand of the mighty. So the poor hath hope, and iniquity &s;toppeth her mouth.</Q>

<P>WHEN we con&s;ider the works of God, compo&s;ed of the material and intellectual &s;y&s;tems, with their varying orders, con&s;titutions and operations of being; they give us a mo&s;t grand idea of the immen&s;ity and infinite perfecti|on of the creator. Univer&s;al nature is con&s;tituted with &s;uch wi&s;dom, and adorned with &s;o many glo|ries, that the Father of it mu&s;t be a Being, in him|&s;elf glorious and wi&s;e infinitely above our com|prehen&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="017002_0003_0F9ED071B3D1E650">
LOOKING back to the time of creation, when divine council brought forth, and completed the birth of nature, we are apt to conceive it a period the mo&s;t filled with divine glory of any which hath happened; containing more bright di&s;cove|ries of the God-head, than any which have &s;uc|ceeded; and that there was in that work &s;ome more immediate exertions of his power and wi&s;|dom, than have &s;ince been generally exerci&s;ed. Doubtle&s;s that period and work did contain di&s;|coveries of &s;uch immen&s;e perfection, as will for|ever delight and a&s;toni&s;h all his rational and virtu|ous creatures; but then, I imagine, we ought ra|ther to conceive the time of creation, as the begin|ing of a new aera, of which every &s;ucceeding part is as glorious, and as much filled with marks and di&s;plays of God's infinite perfection, as the fir&s;t was. When &s;upreme power, wi&s;dom and good|ne&s;s had given exi&s;tence to created nature; the way was prepared for the &s;ame perfections to be exerci&s;ed in pre&s;erving, governing and determin|ing its &s;everal parts and powers, to the purpo&s;es for which they were de&s;igned, both in his natural and moral government.</P>
<P>THE univer&s;al and con&s;tant providence of Je|hovah, is as bright a di&s;play of him&s;elf as creation was. Inattention and irreligion are the principal rea&s;ons it is not thus conceived. The univer&s;e, the material and intellectual &s;y&s;tems, with all their parts and all their powers, are under a con&s;tant direction of the Deity. He not only upholds the
<PB N="5" REF="017002_0004_0F9ED07280D954B8">
&s;econdary powers or &s;econd cau&s;es which are ope|rating; but points them to the ends which he hath in de&s;ign, in &s;uch a manner, that an attentive and pious mind cannot overlook his agency.</P>
<P>COULD we comprehend the divine plan&mdash;could we look through the &s;cheme of Heaven, we &s;hould doubtle&s;s &s;ee that all natural events, all political events, and all the wi&s;dom of this world, are permitted and de&s;igned by the Mo&s;t High, for the benefit of his moral government, to di&s;play his own glory, and bring eventual perfection and ble&s;&s;edne&s;s to the univer&s;e. The doctrines of the Holy Scripture confirm the&s;e ideas&mdash;they teach us that tho&s;e natural events, which in our view have the &s;malle&s;t po&s;&s;ible influence, even the fall|ing of a hair from our heads, do not happen without a divine ordering; and if there be a par|ticular direction of heaven therein, infinite wi&s;dom means thereby to accompli&s;h &s;ome important end. If there be a divine direction in all tho&s;e mo&s;t mi|nute events, how glorious, and of what infinite energy mu&s;t be the con&s;tant exertions of God|head! which operate upon the whole, keeping all the parts in order, and directing them to the great|e&s;t final perfection. This view of divine provi|dence gives us as venerable an idea of the GREAT SUPREME, as we can have from con&s;idering him the &s;elf-exi&s;tent GOD, and creator of the univer&s;e&mdash;This view of the &s;ubject teaches us, that a &s;tudy of divine providence is one of the mo&s;t important and improving Chri&s;tian duties; one of the be&s;t
<PB N="6" REF="017002_0005_0F9ED07335AAFF98">
means for acquiring ju&s;t apprehen&s;ions of the di|vine character and will, and for exciting adoration, Chri&s;tian reliance and gratitude. Men's lu&s;ts are &s;o oppo&s;ed, not only to God and truth, but to the happine&s;s and mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential privileges of human nature; that if there were not a con&s;tant <HI>&s;uperior influence,</HI> controuling the whole, all order, peace, improvement and civil and &s;ocial rights would be lo&s;t in the confu&s;ion and violence of iniquity. The&s;e providential influences are meant in the &s;criptures, when they &s;peak of the Lord bringing light out of darkne&s;s, and order out of confu&s;ion&mdash;the wrathful exertions of men, which he per|mits, are over-ruled to prai&s;e him and promote his cau&s;e, the remainder of wrath he re&s;traineth.</P>
<P>THE MOST HIGH hath exerci&s;ed a &s;pecial agen|cy, through every age of the world, for the pre|&s;ervation of his church; which is the rea&s;on that the gates of hell, and the de&s;igns of wicked men, have never prevailed again&s;t it. Many events happen in &s;o &s;ingular and extraordinary a manner, that is is impo&s;&s;ible a devout mind &s;hould not &s;ee in them the hand of a GOD. The ordering of things is often &s;uch, though we cannot call it mi|raculous, as to carry evidence of a divine interpo|&s;ition, nearly equal to any miracle which could be wrought. A people or individuals experiencing &s;uch interpo&s;itions in their favor, ought publicly and fervently to adore, the wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s by which they are pre&s;erved.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="017002_0006_0F9ED07423C84F10">
THE duties to which we are particularly direct|ed this day, are the mo&s;t devout GRATITUDE and THANKSGIVING to the GOD of HEAVEN, both for public and private ble&s;&s;ings. No &s;ubject of me|ditation is more proper to quicken our devotion, than a recollection of that kind and con&s;tant pro|vidence, by which our land and its intere&s;ts have been pre&s;erved, in the mid&s;t of great dangers; and at &s;undry times, in &s;uch ways as have demon|&s;trated a divine interference. <HI>The works of the Lord are great, &s;ought out of all them that have plea&s;ure therein; and he hath made his wonderful works to be remembered.</HI></P>
<P>OUR text points us to a particular con&s;ide|ration, of that providential agency, which bringeth down the proud feelings and high looks of men, and de&s;troyeth the de&s;igns of the wicked, who are powerful, crafty, and wi&s;e to do evil. <HI>He di&s;ap|pointeth the devices of the crafty, &s;o that their hands cannot perform their enterprize.</HI> The highe&s;t wrought policy of men is &s;topped in its cour&s;e&mdash;the gradual and irre&s;i&s;table execution of the divine coun&s;el ar|re&s;ts their mea&s;ures, by enfeebling their hand, and enervating the in&s;truments on which they depend. <HI>He taketh the wi&s;e in their own craftine&s;s, and the coun&s;el of the froward is carried headlong.</HI> The policy they u&s;e is often overruled to baffle it&s;elf, or to take them&s;elves in the &s;nare, which was layed for others; &s;o that their highe&s;t expectations fall headlong into ruin. <HI>They meet with darkne&s;s in the day time</HI>&mdash;where they did not expect it. Thinking their de&s;igns
<PB N="8" REF="017002_0007_0F9ED074B45D7CB0">
wi&s;ely concerted, and &s;o powerfully &s;upported that they cannot fail; the Almighty interpo&s;es at an unexpected time, and by unexpected means &s;hews that the weake&s;t in&s;truments, under his di|rection, are more powerful than the craftine&s;s, wi&s;dom and &s;trength of man.</P>
<P>IN this way, <HI>He &s;aveth the poor from the &s;word, from their mouths, and from the hand of the mighty&mdash;So that the poor hath hope, and iniquity &s;toppeth her mouth.</HI> So that tho&s;e who are engaged in a righteous cau&s;e, whatever difficulties a&s;&s;ault them, ought notwith|&s;tanding to tru&s;t in the Lord, who can deliver in his own way by his own in&s;truments, and in his own time&mdash;So that tho&s;e who contemn the &s;uperin|tending influence of Jehovah, and de&s;pi&s;e divine and human obligations are compelled to &s;top their mouths; being convinced by his glorious works, that there is a God who protects &s;uch as tru&s;t in him, and holds in his hand the reins of univer&s;al government.</P>
<P>You remember, my brethren, the extraordinary in&s;tance of Ahitophel's coun&s;el being turned into fooli&s;hne&s;s.&mdash;King David in circum&s;tances almo&s;t de&s;perate, &s;triving again&s;t the rebellion of an un|grateful &s;on, and accompanied by a faithful, but &s;mall band, was flying from place to place, for his own per&s;onal &s;afety.&mdash;Ahitophel was a politic man, full of &s;tratagem, and renowned for the &s;ounde&s;t wi&s;dom; <HI>&s;o that his coun&s;el, which he coun&s;elled in tho&s;e days, was as if a man had enquired at the oracle of God.</HI> Had the traiterous Ab&s;olom, who was at this time in great force, adopted his advice, and
<PB N="9" REF="017002_0008_0F9ED075741A6100">
followed hard upon his royal father, while his num|bers were &s;mall and fatigued, they mu&s;t in all pro|bability have fallen an ea&s;y prey. By a particular influence of heaven, Ab&s;olom was inclined to adopt other coun&s;el, which was given on purpo&s;e for his de&s;truction. A &s;hort delay afforded time for the country to ri&s;e, and &s;ave their injured and be|loved &s;overeign, from an unnatural de&s;truction. Thus Ab&s;olom's affairs &s;uddenly &s;unk from the faire&s;t pro&s;pects, into irretrievable ruin&mdash;this was the work and influence of GOD!</P>
<P>PERMIT me to remind you of another in&s;tance, which is likewi&s;e recorded in the &s;cripture&mdash;the deli|verance of I&s;rael by the elevation of Mordecai, and the fall of Haman. Mordecai was a Jew, and the only one who was capable of being the patron of his people, who were then in captivity, &s;ubjected to the &s;evere&s;t bondage&mdash;Haman was a proud, ty|rannical favorite at the Babylonian court, mali|ciou&s;ly de&s;igning to de&s;troy the Jews, and plan|ning the mo&s;t cruel means for their total extirpa|tion&mdash;He had even built the gallows, upon which he de&s;igned Mordecai their chief man &s;hould be hanged, &s;o &s;anguine were his expectations! What he e&s;teemed a private affront was the ground of his enmity again&s;t the whole nation; and as a means of revenge, and to di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s them of the royal fa|vor, he accu&s;ed their religious laws and in&s;titutions, which di&s;tingui&s;hed them from all other people, and which they ob&s;erved for the honor of Jehovah, even in their captive &s;tate. The Lord, who&s;e eye
<PB N="10" REF="017002_0009_0F9ED076B5487508">
&s;eeth all things, beheld and determined to vindi|cate him&s;elf, his in&s;titutions and his people, and he di&s;concerted the infernal de&s;ign by a concur|rence of events, apparently unintere&s;ting in them|&s;elves, but in the connexion his infinite wi&s;dom ar|ranged them, &s;ufficient for the great de&s;ign. It &s;o happened on a certain night, that the king could not &s;leep&mdash;for his entertainment and probably to invite repo&s;e, he ordered the book of records to be read&mdash;It was found recorded, that in former time Mordecai had detected and di&s;clo&s;ed a trea&s;on a|gain&s;t the life of the king; and upon enquiry that he had never beeen rewarded. God inclined him to reward this in&s;tance of fidelity, though it had been long forgoten. It was propo&s;ed to Haman, <HI>What &s;hould be done to the man whom the king delighted to honor?</HI> He propo&s;ed the mo&s;t extravagant ho|nors, proudly thinking to receive them him&s;elf, and was ordered immediately to confer them on Mordecai&mdash;this turned the balance, and from that hour, every event concured for Haman's de&s;truc|tion, until he died in the place prepared for Mor|decai, who &s;ucceeded him in the royal favor, and the Jews were delivered. That one &s;leeple&s;s hour of the king, was a nece&s;&s;ary link in the chain of means for I&s;rael's deliverance. Who may not &s;ee the hand and coun&s;el of the LORD in all this!&mdash;Human life is full of &s;uch interpo&s;itions; whereby the coun&s;el of the froward is carried headlong, tho&s;e who cannot defend them&s;elves pre&s;erved, and iniquity obliged to &s;top its mouth.</P>

LET us next take notice of GOD's dealings with us his people. We ought piou&s;ly and gratefully to recognize the divine influence, and ordering of events, &s;ince the commencement of the war in which we are now engaged. The God of heaven hath marvelou&s;ly wrought for us! Sometimes by dark|ening and infatuating the coun&s;el of our enemies&mdash;Sometimes wonderfully interpo&s;ing to derange their mea&s;ures and break their force&mdash;Sometimes by in|&s;piring our people with an irre&s;i&s;table enthu&s;ia&s;m, which dares to attempt and execute the greate&s;t en|terpri&s;es&mdash;Sometimes by affording us &s;upplies in an extraordinary way, which no ordinary means could procure&mdash;and often by di&s;covering the &s;nare which was laid in darkne&s;s, and ob&s;erved only by his eye which &s;eeth in the darkne&s;s, as in the light.</P>
<P>IT &s;eems that divine coun&s;el hath &s;ome great de&s;ings to accompli&s;h in this land. The pious ob&s;erver of his providence may &s;ee, that from the time of its fir&s;t di&s;covery, he hath been preparing the &s;tage by the energy of unerring wi&s;dom, for &s;ome very grand exhibitions, which will probably di&s;play his glory to all the nations of the earth, and improve &s;ocial happine&s;s and rights to a high|er degree of perfection than hath yet taken place in the world. The manner of its &s;ettlement is one of the mo&s;t extraordinary events recorded in hi&s;tory; religion was the motive, and though piety is now much decayed, may we not hope that the intere&s;ts of Me&s;&s;iah's kingdom, which influenced the fir&s;t adventurers, &s;hall be yet mo&s;t
<PB N="12" REF="017002_0011_0F9ED0784B911EE0">
gloriou&s;ly advanced thereby. Our rapid popu|lation is viewed with wonder, wherever it is known, there is not an in&s;tance equalling it in the hi&s;tory of the world. The commencement of the pre&s;ent war, was the opening of a new aera, every part of which is filled with wonders, di&s;|covering that there is a God, who ruleth and doth his plea&s;ure among the kingdoms of the world. When this controver&s;y began, not a mind among us anticipated the length to which it would run, nor the great political changes it hath produced.&mdash;We viewed it as a family quarrel, which mu&s;t and would be accomodated&mdash;in this we judged from our own feelings, being ignorant of God's de&s;ign. It now appears, that the Lord de&s;igned it for a compleat &s;eparation of the Briti&s;h empire. And con&s;idering it as fixed by God's appointment, that a &s;eparation &s;hould take place; may we not &s;ee his wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s to us in determining the time. The event hath been ge|nerally e&s;teemed premature, as ha&s;tened, unhap|pily for us, by the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;elf-defence.&mdash;But is not this a mi&s;take? We had received every po&s;&s;ible benefit from the connection, and were beginning to be endangered&mdash;we had learned the Briti&s;h arts&mdash;had drank at her fountains of &s;cience&mdash;made her mo&s;t valuable improvements our own&mdash;were rich enough for a virtuous and free State;&mdash;and were beginning to import her luxury, effeminacy and irreligion. Had the national con|nection continued longer, a familiar intercour&s;e
<PB N="13" REF="017002_0012_0F9ED07871C16D40">
would have introduced into this new country, that declen&s;ion of morals, which hath u&s;ually been produced in an old empire, by their luxury and pride; and the arts of a corrupt court, might have &s;educed &s;o many of our own citizens, as to render an emancipation more difficult, even though we had increa&s;ed both in riches and numbers. Thus we &s;ee the goodne&s;s and the the care of God, exerci&s;ed for the pre&s;ervation of our virtue, even in appointing the time for this &s;eparation. And let us not mea&s;ure the councils of Heaven, upon the narrow &s;cale of &s;elf-regard; the Mo&s;t High is governing the world for the advancement of virtue, and may not this event be propitious to the intere&s;ts of morality in Great-Britain, by dry|ing up &s;ome of the &s;ources of that luxury, which through a great part of the nation, hath effaced almo&s;t every impre&s;&s;ion of revealed religion, and of a &s;uperintending providence. The Mo&s;t High had the means in readine&s;s, and in order for the accompli&s;hment of his own purpo&s;e&mdash;He often rai&s;es up wicked men as in&s;truments to execute what he hath decreed; and in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e permitted tho&s;e, whom we called our fathers and brethren, and whom we reverenced and loved as &s;uch, to entertain evil de&s;igns again&s;t us&mdash;de&s;igns fraught with impolicy, inju&s;tice and oppre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>THERE were at that time, wi&s;e men in the Bri|ti&s;h Senate who fore&s;aw the con&s;equences, and prophe&s;ied the tragic effects, as they have &s;ince hap|pened, urging their opinions by the united weight

of good policy, ju&s;tice and mercy&mdash;but in vain! As in the ca&s;e of Pharoah, &s;o in this; the Lord permitted tho&s;e who held the reins of government, to harden their hearts, and &s;hut their eyes again&s;t wi&s;dom; probably it was, that he might bring us out from under their dominion with a high hand, and &s;o as to di&s;play his glory before the nations of the earth. Had not an infatuation been permited it is impo&s;&s;ible they &s;hould have remained &s;o long ignorant, of the &s;tate&punc; feelings, and united &s;entiments of the people in this country, as is evi|dent from their mea&s;ures, they did&mdash;had it not been determinied by the Mo&s;t High, that they &s;hould believe a lying &s;pirit, it would have been impo&s;&s;ible to give &s;uch credit as they did, to a few evil per&s;ons, who e&s;caped from among us, and who&s;e own private intere&s;t led them to deceive. This infatuation and diffu&s;ion for &s;everal years re|tarded the vigorous efforts of our enemies; and was permitted left the &s;torm &s;hould gather more fa&s;t, or in greater force, than we were prepared to receive it&mdash;this permi&s;&s;ion of divine providence was kind to us, but fatal to them&mdash;thus the <HI>Lord de&s;troyeth the wi&s;dom of the wi&s;e!</HI> By viewing the &s;ub&s;equent &s;chemes of Briti&s;h policy, we may &s;ee, <HI>how he carried the coun&s;els of the froward headlong;</HI> for it is certain, that mo&s;t of their coun&s;els have turn|ed upon their own heads, and ha&s;tened the events, which they wi&s;hed to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">.

NEXT let us view the events which have hap|pened in our own country, and &s;ee in them both the wonderful influences and interpo&s;ition of the MOST MERCIFUL. To what cau&s;e, but the imme|diate influence of Jehovah, can we impute the a&s;toni&s;hing union, both of &s;entiment and feeling, which pervaded through the whole American em|pire, though of prodigious extent, and divided in|to many provinces; each of which had its &s;epe|rate legi&s;lature, its own ideas of law and govern|ment, and its own peculiar manners, cu&s;toms and jealou&s;ies. A &s;ympathy unfelt before, in&s;tantane|ou&s;ly and reciprocally circulated, by which the in|juries of every part were felt and re&s;ented through the whole&mdash;when &s;ome of the fir&s;t mini&s;terial mea|&s;ures were &s;peciou&s;ly covered and de&s;igned to be enforced by our own luxury; the whole body of the people &s;eemed to have an intuitive view of the con&s;equences which would follow, if they received the alluring bait, and determined to deny them|&s;elves any gratification, rather than admit a prece|dent which might be drawn into dangerous prac|tice hereafter.

It was the Lord who rai&s;ed up and in&s;pired the country with confi|dence in a commander, who was formed by his own infinite wi&s;dom, on purpo&s;e for the great de|&s;ign of vindicating American freedom.&mdash;Our ea&s;tern coa&s;t was mo&s;t impregnable, both by its natural &s;ituation, and po&s;ition of ground, and the unanimity of its inhabitants, and could by no means be e&s;teemed a key to the country; on all which accounts it was the mo&s;t improper place, the enemy could have cho&s;en to open the bloody &s;cene: And had they in&s;tead of that occupied the po&s;ition they now hold, where a naval force may co-operate with and defend one on the land, a &s;ingle campaign in the unprepared &s;ituation we then were, might have decided the whole conte&s;t.&mdash;The LORD directed where they &s;hould attempt, that they might be baffled! Some of the fir&s;t mi|litary rencounters, though bloody, were ordered by infinite wi&s;dom to check the rage of the ene|my, and &s;hew them that they had undertaken a &s;erious ta&s;k; and at the &s;ame time teach us our own con&s;equence in the field, and that we were able, under GOD, to defend our&s;elves.</P>
<P>SOON after the commencement of ho&s;tilities, when we were upon the brink of de&s;truction, through want of military &s;tores and the habili|ments of war: Providence threw into our hands,

by the capture of a &s;tore-&s;hip, the very nece&s;&s;aries which we mo&s;t wanted&mdash;An interpo&s;i|tion of Heaven, which ought never to be forgot|ten! Several times &s;ince we have had &s;upplies, both of cloathing and provi&s;ion, &s;ent in the &s;ame manner, at the time when, and to the places where they were needed.&mdash;The prodigious number of captures made from the enemy upon the &s;eas, hath generally afforded us a comfortable &s;upply of foreign articles; which appears &s;urprizing when we con&s;ider the greatne&s;s of their naval force, and the &s;mallne&s;s and inexperience of our own; and &s;hews us that the Lord directeth in all the&s;e things. In the &s;econd year of the war, a formidable naval and land force was &s;ent again&s;t one of the mo&s;t &s;outhern States in the confederacy: As things were then circum&s;tanced with that country, any con&s;iderable &s;ucce&s;s of the enemy, mu&s;t have de|tached &s;everal States from the union, and been much more fatal to our cau&s;e, than their late &s;uc|ce&s;s in the &s;ame parts can be.&mdash;He who directeth the events of war, determined that the de&s;ign &s;hould be defeated for that time, in a mo&s;t &s;ur|prizing manner, by a body of men ha&s;tily drawn together, and whom they viewed with contempt.&mdash;</P>
<P>THERE have been &s;everal gloomy periods, in which the arm of the LORD and the coun&s;el of the ALMIGHTY, have wrought &s;alvation for us, in a wonderful manner.</P>
<P>WE remember the time, after the conque&s;t of a con&s;iderable part of the States of New-York and New-Jer&s;ey, when <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> force,

flu&s;hed with victory, and aiming towards the ca|pital of our councils&mdash;Our army, except a brave handful, was di&s;banded, and every thing in a &s;tate of di&s;traction.&mdash;In this hour of great deci&s;ion, when, as the country was circum&s;tanced, a few weeks of vigorous action mu&s;t have determined the fate of America; our enemy were not per|mited to di&s;cern the importance of the moment! Thinking the work done, and &s;itting down to eat and drink the &s;poils of cruelty, they were taken in their own craftine&s;s.</P>
<P>PLEASE to turn your attention to the &s;ucceed|ing campaign. The Briti&s;h force in America was then very great; compo&s;ed of two grand arma|ments, the northern and &s;outhern. One of the mo&s;t fortunate events we could then wi&s;h, was &s;uch a de&s;tination of tho&s;e two formidable powers, that they might not act in concert, and bring their united efforts to a point, and thus form a &s;epera|tion between the northern and &s;outhern States. By &s;ome influence their councils were darkened! Providence led their &s;outhern armament from the mo&s;t important place of action, by a lengthy rout through the waters of Virginia, where more than a year was &s;pent without any thing decided, and that great force was finally obliged to quit its con|que&s;ts, and return with ignominy.</P>
<P>IN the north, appearances were more gloomy, for a &s;ea&s;on a cloud ro&s;e &s;o black that all coutenan|ces gathered palene&s;s&mdash;every thing that had hap|pened in that quarter, for a long time before, was calculated to in&s;pire the enemy with precipitation

and a ra&s;h confidence&mdash;they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them&s;elves of tho&s;e fortre&s;&s;es on which we depended, in &s;uch a manner as wrought their pride and pre&s;umption to the highe&s;t pitch&mdash;the Lord was preparing them for a fall! He allured them into a &s;nare from which they could never e&s;cape! By means the mo&s;t different from human concerting, he deliver|ed their whole armament into our hands, and brought wonderful &s;alvation to our country. This was the Lord's work and marvelous in our eyes! and prepared the way for our being known and acknowledged among the nations as brethren.</P>
<P>THERE has been at many times, and in divers ways, a &s;urprizing interpo&s;ition of providence, in the di&s;covery of trea&s;ons and con&s;piracies again&s;t the &s;tate, and its mo&s;t important &s;ervants. I &s;hall mention only one, which is a recent in&s;tance of de|liverance, and ought to be remembered this day, with the mo&s;t devout gratitude. The di&s;co|very of a traiterous plot which had been for a long time concerting and maturing in the cabinet of darkne&s;s, under the nuture of in&s;truments vile enough for the perpetration of any crime, how|ever repugnant to the laws of God and nature&mdash;this con&s;piracy was &s;o ripe for execution, that a day or two more intervening before the di&s;covery, might have &s;ealed the doom of America, by the ma&s;&s;acre of our brave and virtuous commander, and many others who have di&s;tingui&s;hed them|&s;elves in defence of the country; and the key to our territories, our magazines, our ar&s;enals, our &s;oldiery in the hands of an in&s;ulting foe.</P>

WAS it not the God of heaven who pre&s;erved us in this danger? &s;urely it was. The trea&s;on was arranged&mdash;it was ripe for execution&mdash;the princi|pal in&s;trument of treachery, was one prepared for any wickedne&s;s, and placed by the un&s;u&s;pecting confidence of his country, in a &s;ituation, and with full power to accompli&s;h his de&s;ign&mdash;the whole was hid from man&mdash;how awful is that hour in re|tro&s;pective view! The Lord &s;aw, and he wondered that there was no deliverer, therefore his own arm brought &s;alvation, and his wi&s;dom &s;aved us! He directed the &s;teps of a triumvirate of virtuous young citizens, to an unfrequented &s;tation&mdash;His providence placed them as a centry, to take the man, who had been a principal emi&s;&s;ary in con|certing the plot; and thus the di&s;covery was made, which &s;aved our country from a de&s;truction in pro&s;pect of which the enemy already exulted. Let us prai&s;e him who directeth the times and the &s;ea&s;ons&mdash;he liveth forever, his dominion is from everla&s;ting to everla&s;ting&mdash;all the inhabitants of the earth are reputed as nothing before him&mdash;He doeth according to his will in the army of heaven and among the inhabitants of the earth, and none can &s;ay to him what doe&s;t thou. The in&s;tances I have mentioned, are only a few from among ma|ny, in which the kind direction, influence and in|terpo&s;ition of providence might be ob&s;erved&mdash;the &s;ubject is far too copious for the limits of a &s;ingle di&s;cour&s;e, and to treat it ju&s;tly, requires much greater di&s;cernment than I f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">el my&s;elf to po&s;&s;e&s;s&mdash;The works of God's providence, are immen&s;e as

<P>OUGHT we not likewi&s;e this day to recognize divine goodne&s;s&punc; in providing us with plenty of food&mdash;our &s;tores are filled with good things; and though &s;ome part of the &s;ea&s;on was &s;uch as excited our apprehen&s;ions, the event hath taught us they were groundle&s;s, and that the Lord can direct the &s;ea&s;ons better than man&mdash;It is very common, that we &s;infully &s;u&s;pect and are jealous of Providence, while God is ordering nature, in the be&s;t manner, to give us a rich &s;upply.</P>
<P>LET us remember with gratitude, the extraordi|nary health, which hath attended us through the year pa&s;t. I pre&s;ume the olde&s;t per&s;on in this place, cannot recollect an in&s;tance of &s;o little &s;ick|ne&s;s and &s;o few deaths. Some of our friends have been taken from us, but the proportion, compared with our numbers, is &s;mall; and &s;o far as I have heard, the like extraordinary health hath prevailed both in our armies and among the people in ge|neral. While we rejoice in the pre&s;ervation of life and health another year, let us not wax wanton and forget our mortality. Sickne&s;s and death mu&s;t come&mdash;the &s;olemn decree, <HI>du&s;t thou art, and unto du&s;t thou &s;halt return,</HI> mu&s;t be accompli&s;hed&mdash;the

Lord grant that we may all live in readine&s;s for the change.</P>
<P>THE ble&s;&s;ings which have been mentioned, great as they can be repre&s;ented, are but temporal and worldly favors&mdash;they are only the &s;malle&s;t of God's benefits, and only valuable as they a&s;&s;i&s;t us to glorify him, &s;erve our fellow men, and prepare for eternity. With what fervent gratitude, we ought to adore the wi&s;dom and mercy which hath brought life and immortality to light! Which pi|ties us under a mo&s;t awful condemnation and death, and offers pardon through the atonement which Je&s;us made by the &s;heding of his own blood&mdash;which invites us to become parties to the covenant of grace, and receive the remi&s;&s;ion of &s;in and the &s;anctification of our natures, and the in|dwelling influences of the HOLY GHOST&mdash;which hath given us many great and precious promi&s;es, offering to make us partakers of a divine nature, and heirs of glory together with CHRIST&mdash;which &s;ets before us the ble&s;&s;edne&s;s of heaven, the Lord him&s;elf to be our portion. Ble&s;&s;ed be the Lord God of I&s;rael who hath vi&s;ited and redeemed us&mdash;who hath rai&s;ed up an horn of &s;alvation for us in the hou&s;e of his &s;ervant David. Let us therefore &s;erve before him in holine&s;s and righteou&s;ne&s;s all the days of our lives.</P>
<P>I CONCLUDE with &s;ome very brief remarks by way of inferrence.</P>
<P>1&s;t. WE are taught to adore GOD's providence, and con|&s;ider his government of the world as a mo&s;t illu&s;trious di&s;|play of his glorious nature. The events which take place before our eyes, are parts of a plan mo&s;t highly wrought, by
<PB N="24" REF="017002_0023_0F9ED083B247B058">
infinite wi&s;dom, goodne&s;s and ju&s;tice. By rea&s;on of the depth of his de&s;igns and works, and the &s;cantine&s;s of hu|man under&s;tanding, we know but a &s;mall portion of his ways. But that his agency might not be forgotten, &s;ome in&s;tances are &s;o ordered as to fla&s;h conviction upon the mind, that nature in its minute&s;t operations, is under the direction of a God, who by &s;mall cau&s;es is producing great events, and accompli&s;hing mo&s;t important purpo&s;es in his moral kingdom.</P>
<P>2d. WE are taught to whom the glory of every &s;alvation is to be attributed. We have con&s;idered &s;ome in&s;tances of deliverance, which are manife&s;tly the effects of a divine interpo&s;ition and the &s;pecial ordering of heaven. The&s;e in&s;tances were de&s;igned by God to bear te&s;timony for him&s;elf, that he is the author of every &s;alvation; and tho' we do not &s;ee his hand &s;o clearly in all, they are neverthele&s;s his work. On the other hand, we &s;hould remember that ca|lamity cometh not out of the du&s;t, but was appointed and is accompli&s;hed by all &s;earching wi&s;dom, to an&s;wer the pur|po&s;es of his own council.</P>
<P>3dly. WE are taught not to tru&s;t in our&s;elves&mdash;not to de|pend on our own wi&s;dom and &s;trength. To exerci&s;e our own power and wi&s;dom for pre&s;ervation, and for obtaining all needed ble&s;&s;ings, is an indi&s;pen&s;able duty, and the &s;lug|gard hath no rea&s;on to expect God will &s;ave him; but when this is done we &s;hould look to the Almighty to give efficacy to our endeavors, to pre&s;erve, ble&s;s and pro&s;per.</P>
<P>IF we tru&s;t in the arm of man, or the wi&s;dom of a crea|ture, the Lord will confound them; for it is his u&s;ual cour&s;e to bring low the proud and exalt the humble, that all the earth may know the Lord reigneth.</P>
<P>IF, my brethren, we de&s;ign to invite the divine protec|tion, let us rejoice that the Lord reigneth, and commend our&s;elves and the public to his holy protection and keeping&mdash;let us be ju&s;t, and merciful, and hone&s;t, and humble ador|ers of God's providence&mdash;let us do our duty to our country our&s;elves and po&s;terity, and then look to him who hath &s;o often wrought gloriou&s;ly in our favor, for the continuance of his goodne&s;s&mdash;that he would make our land glorious and a prai&s;e through the whole earth, and that he would finally receive us to his ble&s;&s;ed kingdom.</P>
