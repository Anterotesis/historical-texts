<P>To de&s;cribe the character of the good SOLDIER, as formed upon the principles and influ|enced by the &s;pirit of Chri&s;tianity, will perfectly &s;uit the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion; this, therefore, &s;hall be at|tempted in the following Di&s;cour&s;e, founded on tho&s;e words of St. Paul, 2 <HI>Timothy,</HI> chapter ii. and the latter part of the &s;econd ver&s;e&mdash;"A GOOD SOLDIER OF JESUS CHRIST."</P>
<P>CHRISTIANITY has an excellent effect on the characters of men, in all the relations which they &s;u&s;|tain in life. It renders them u&s;eful to &s;ociety, as well as happy in them&s;elves. It leads the &s;oldier in par|ticular to true glory in the path of virtue, and by giving him a ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of his relation and obligations to his Maker, qualifies him for the &s;ervice of his country.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="028069_0004_0FD68FD54E044D78">
IT is highly plea&s;ing to contemplate the benevo|lent de&s;ign of the go&s;pel in&s;titution. By &s;ubduing the pa&s;&s;ions of men, tho&s;e &s;ources of contention, and reforming the heart, this divine religion &s;hall ulti|mately exclude war from the face of the earth; and by diffu&s;ing univer&s;al charity, produce univer&s;al peace. But this great event can only be con&s;idered as the &s;ubject of prophecy, the accompli&s;hment of which, though certain, is probably far di&s;tant in futurity.</P>
<P>IT adds a grandeur to &s;cripture prophecy, when we con&s;ider it as directing its eye through &s;uch long extended periods of time as a&s;toni&s;h the minds of mortals; though they &s;ink to nothing in the &s;ight of Him who&s;e exi&s;tence is eternal, and with whom a thou&s;and years are as one day, and one day as a thou|&s;and years.</P>
<P>CHRISTIANITY is emphatically the work of God. Introduced and e&s;tabli&s;hed by the exerci&s;e of miracu|lous powers, it made &s;urpri&s;ing progre&s;s, &s;o long as it was &s;upported and confirmed by <HI>that</HI> inconte&s;tible evidence of its divine original; &s;ince which its preva|lence has been very unequal, &s;low at the be&s;t, and on the whole extremely &s;hort of what its early &s;ucce&s;s &s;eemed to indicate. The re-appearance of its divine Author, attended with the &s;ame miraculous powers, an event plainly predicted, will go far towards effect|ing his gracious purpo&s;e. But nothing &s;hort of re|peated appearances of this nature, or &s;ucce&s;&s;ive di&s;|pen&s;ations
<PB N="7" REF="028069_0005_0FD68FDB82089588">
of Chri&s;tianity, each more illu&s;trious than the preceding, can complete the great de&s;ign. When death &s;hall be &s;wallowed up in victory, tears &s;hall be wiped from all faces, a new heaven and new earth &s;hall ari&s;e from the a&s;hes of the old, and the world become a kingdom of righteou&s;ne&s;s and peace.</P>
<P>As the progre&s;s of the &s;ea&s;ons cannot, &s;o neither can the advancement of Chri&s;tianity, be accelerated beyond the de&s;ign of its Author. One part mu&s;t con|form to another; and it is as ab&s;urd to expect general peace in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of human nature, as the fruits of &s;ummer amid the fro&s;ts and &s;nows of winter. It is only by re&s;toring man to his primitive character, the moral image of his Maker, an event which we as confidently expect as the return of &s;ea&s;ons, that wars &s;hall cea&s;e to the ends of the earth.</P>
<P>IN the pre&s;ent &s;tate of mankind, with re&s;pect to moral and religious improvement, war is nece&s;&s;ary upon the &s;ame principle, and for the &s;ame rea&s;on, that the exerci&s;e of the &s;word of ju&s;tice is nece&s;&s;ary in the hand of the magi&s;trate. As the one vindicates the rights, and protects the lives of individuals, the other with equal rea&s;on protects and vindicates the rights of nations.</P>
<P>NATIONAL pride, the eager thir&s;t for property, and the equally eager lu&s;t of dominion, may produce &s;uch injuries and in&s;ults, as to excite rational re&s;ent|ment in the brea&s;ts of the mo&s;t di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate, and ren|der

it a duty indi&s;pen&s;able for a people to arm in defence of that inheritance which Heaven has be|&s;towed upon them, and of which, it would be igno|minious <HI>tamely</HI> to &s;uffer men to deprive them. Whil&s;t Chri&s;tianity forbids every other &s;pecies of war, it ev|idently enjoins that <HI>&s;elf-defence</HI> which is the fir&s;t law of nature, and mu&s;t be in force &s;o long as we have an enemy to threaten, or an intere&s;t to defend. Our text implies, the con&s;i&s;tency of war with the religion of Chri&s;t; as we can hardly &s;uppo&s;e the in&s;pired author would have alluded to a calling which Chri&s;|tianity forbids, to illu&s;trate the character of the Chri&s;tian.</P>
<P>THE &s;oldier, therefore, in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of &s;oci|ety, is a profe&s;&s;ion as honourable as it is u&s;eful. He is, in the hand of Providence, and under the direction of the magi&s;trate, the &s;afety of his country, the protector of her honour and her intere&s;ts. This u&s;eful charac|ter is highly adorned and rendered &s;till more u&s;eful to &s;ociety by the influence of Chri&s;tianity, which, by en|li&s;ting men into the &s;ervice, and forming them as good &s;oldiers of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, qualifies them in the highe&s;t degree for the &s;ervice of their country.</P>
<P>SELF-COMMAND&mdash;a true &s;en&s;e of honour&mdash;the love of glory&mdash;patrioti&s;m and courage, di&s;tingui&s;h the good &s;oldier; and the&s;e are produced in the greate&s;t perfection by an acquaintance with Chri&s;tianity. The fir&s;t le&s;&s;on taught under the di&s;cipline of Chri&s;t is <HI>&s;elf-command,</HI>
<PB N="9" REF="028069_0007_0FD68FE0A18CDA18">
a di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate attention to the voice of rea|&s;on and truth; choo&s;ing peace as the greate&s;t good, and engaging in war only to en&s;ure the ble&s;&s;ings of peace. The &s;oldier of the Prince of Peace formed by his religion, mu&s;t be the &s;on of peace; he will never be the aggre&s;&s;or on the rights of others; he wears on his brea&s;t, what ought to be the motto of every Chri&s;tian, <HI>Bear and forbear;</HI> he is not ea&s;ily pro|voked, nor &s;uffers re&s;entment, that enemy of peace, lightly to enter his bo&s;om; he is not overcome of evil, but endeavours to overcome evil with good.</P>
<P>THERE is, however, a certain point, beyond which forbearance is folly, and yielding is madne&s;s; this is the point of honour to which the Chri&s;tian &s;oldier carefully attends, and by which he governs his con|duct.</P>
<P>WHATEVER the crooked policy of this world may have &s;ugge&s;ted to the contrary, the honour and rights of nations, as well as of individuals, are be&s;t vindicat|ed on the generous maxims of the go&s;pel: and re&s;ent|ment will be mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sfully expre&s;&s;ed, when ju&s;ti|fied by rea&s;on dignified with religion, and attended with the cleare&s;t evidence not only of ju&s;tice, but even of forbearance towards the offending party. The Chri&s;tian &s;oldier draws his &s;word at the call of ju&s;tice, in the cau&s;e of human happine&s;s; it is pur&s;uing this cau&s;e with propriety, that con&s;titutes the dignity and honour of his character.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="028069_0008_0FD68FE4AAEA9A50">
HONOUR, as taught by Chri&s;tianity, is indeed widely different from that which is founded on the capricious maxims of the world. The Chri&s;tian &s;oldier is the votary of <HI>true</HI> honour; he feels its worth; it warms his heart, and nerves his arm; he under&s;tands and obeys its dictates, while he feels the utmo&s;t contempt for its tawdry counterfeits.</P>
<P>HONOUR, alas! thou &s;trangely pro&s;tituted name! how art thou degraded by being connected with characters and with actions, as dete&s;table to human|ity as they are incon&s;i&s;tent with rea&s;on and religion! How often is thy &s;acred name applied to a phantom engendered by the wor&s;t pa&s;&s;ions of the human heart, and cheri&s;hed at the expen&s;e of human happine&s;s! How art thou degraded when made to attend the bloody progre&s;s of him, who de&s;troys thou&s;ands to gratify his own pride or lu&s;t of dominion; that his vile head may be adorned with a crown, and his name be tran&s;mitted to po&s;terity as the conqueror of na|tions. How art thou degraded when called in to ju&s;|tify a barbarous cu&s;tom of avenging per&s;onal injuries at the expen&s;e of life, in defiance of civil order, in the face of law, rea&s;on, con&s;cience, and religion. The Chri&s;tian &s;oldier will vindicate thy rights, and teach mankind that honour and virtue are in&s;eparable; that not he who en&s;laveth, much le&s;s who de&s;troyeth, but the &s;aviour and friend of man, who after the ex|ample of the Saviour of the world, expo&s;eth or even
<PB N="11" REF="028069_0009_0FD68FE6D66B8C38">
layeth down his own life for the good of others, is the man of true honour; that the dignity of private character is better a&s;&s;erted, by treating per&s;onal inju|ries with an indignant &s;ilence, or puni&s;hing the of|fender by making him feel your &s;uperior goodne&s;s, than by indulging a petulant re&s;entment, the evidence of a little mind, or pur&s;uing that revenge which is the effect of a vicious heart. "He that is &s;low to anger is better than the mighty, and he that ruleth, his &s;pirit than he that taketh a city."</P>
<P>THE hope of glory animates the Chri&s;tian &s;oldier; but it is a glory founded on &s;olid and rational princi|ples, and not that empty, vi&s;ionary thing which fa&s;ci|nates the hearts of the proud and the vain, but which vani&s;hes when examined in the light of rea&s;on and religion.</P>
<P>THE great Author of the univer&s;e &s;eeks his own glory in all that he does; this is his undivided object in the creation and government of the world, in the mi&s;&s;ion of his Son, and the di&s;pen&s;ation of his grace. But this glory re&s;ults from the happine&s;s produced, and &s;hines with a lu&s;tre exactly proportioned to it. Here than we find a &s;tandard by which to e&s;timate the dignity of all rational creatures. He who be&s;t improves the powers entru&s;ted to him for promoting general good, obtains the prize; and the greate&s;t glory re&s;ults from the greate&s;t u&s;efulne&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="028069_0010_0FD68FE81000B9B8">
MAN is at be&s;t extremely limited in his capacity for doing good, and in his opportunities for the ex|erci&s;e of that capacity. Providence does, however, in &s;ome in&s;tances, after long intervals, and by an ad|mirable concurrence of circum&s;tances, exhibit the human character to great advantage, and with &s;uch improvement as to excite the admiration of the world.</P>
<P>How illu&s;trious does the &s;aviour of his country appear, and with what real glory adorned, who, hav|ing &s;ucce&s;sfully drawn his &s;word to vindicate the in|&s;ulted rights of a great nation; the object obtained, pre&s;ides over her coun&s;els in peace, and directs them with &s;uch exqui&s;ite &s;kill as to promote her dome&s;tic pro&s;perity and happine&s;s, and her foreign influence and honour. The glory of his country &s;eems centred in him, and in connexion with his name will be immortal.</P>
<P>BY far the greater part of mankind are, from the order of &s;ociety or the allotments of providence, con|fined to a narrow &s;phere; they are not, however, ex|cluded from the pro&s;pect and pur&s;uit of glory, the certain re&s;ult of filling with propriety the place a&s;|&s;igned us, and acting our part well in the world's great drama. The mo&s;t ob&s;cure character has its connexions, and con&s;equently its influence on &s;ociety, which being directed in favour of virtue and human happine&s;s, &s;hall not lo&s;e its reward; for however un|noticed &s;uch per&s;ons may pa&s;s down the &s;tream of
<PB N="13" REF="028069_0011_0FD68FEBA8C73D50">
time, they are di&s;tingui&s;hed by Him who&s;e eye &s;eeth all things, and &s;hall finally meet with the public ap|plau&s;es of their Redeemer and Judge.</P>
<P>No &s;ea&s;on is &s;o quiet in this turbulent world, as to exclude the propriety of military preparation; the be&s;t &s;ecurity for peace, is to be prepared for war. Too great a di&s;tinction between the civil and military characters is productive of evil. The wi&s;dom of gov|ernment &s;hould aim to unite both in the &s;ame per|&s;ons; that every citizen may con&s;ider him&s;elf as a &s;oldier, and every &s;oldier may remember that he is a citizen.</P>
<P>CHRISTIANITY will effect this genuine patrioti&s;m. To the Chri&s;tian, the love of his country is dome&s;tic love enlarged. It de&s;troys trifling di&s;tinctions, and while it embraces with warmth the intere&s;ts of a par|ticular nation, it is corrected by the love of human kind.</P>
<P>HOW de&s;picable was the patrioti&s;m which taught the Grecian and Roman &s;oldier to &s;eek the aggran|di&s;ement of his own, at the expen&s;e and with the ruin of every other country. The Chri&s;tian &s;oldier views things on a more extended plan. The world is his country; man his brother; and nothing is con|&s;idered as foreign to him, which relates to the good of the &s;pecies; when pur&s;uing the intere&s;t of a part, he does not overlook the good of the <HI>whole;</HI> when he un&s;heathes his &s;word, it is not to inflict mi&s;ery on
<PB N="14" REF="028069_0012_0FD68FECC8EC7838">
others, but to defend the inheritance which God has given him; the ju&s;tice of his cau&s;e gives &s;teadine&s;s to his temper, and firmne&s;s to his arm, in the greate&s;t dangers.</P>
<P>NATURE has inve&s;ted death with terrors; to pre|tend not to feel them, is a vain boa&s;t; &s;ome &s;tronger pa&s;&s;ion may &s;tifle, nothing but religion can rai&s;e the &s;oul above, the fears of death, or in&s;pire a rational courage in the views of it.</P>
<P>IT is madne&s;s, and not courage, to dare death with|out a hope beyond it. If this momentary life is to be our all, and exi&s;tence to cea&s;e with our cea&s;ing pul&s;e, rea&s;on urges to protract it by every po&s;&s;ible expedient; for what can compen&s;ate for the lo&s;s of being? How are the &s;en&s;ele&s;s a&s;hes of the hero af|fected by the pre&s;ervation or the ruin of his country? both are to him perfectly indifferent.</P>
<P>HOWEVER the under&s;tanding may be dazzled by the fal&s;e rea&s;onings of tho&s;e, who with an ab&s;urd zeal have abu&s;ed the powers of eloquence, to weaken the evidence of a future &s;tate, candour on reflection will acknowledge, that it is weakening, if not de&s;troying the great principle of morality, and the only &s;olid &s;up|port in the hour of danger.</P>
<P>As the pro&s;pect of immortality, &s;o every thing rel|ative to man ri&s;es or falls. Exi&s;tence is hardly worth acknowledging, if confined to a tran&s;ient, anxious
<PB N="15" REF="028069_0013_0FD68FEF93674900">
being of three&s;core years and ten. Connected with a future &s;tate, the great doctrine of the go&s;pel, man holds a nobler rank in the &s;cale of rational creatures, his intere&s;ts become more important, and he feels a debt of gratitude to the Author of his being.</P>
<P>PERSUADED of, and looking forward to an happy immortality, man con&s;iders him&s;elf as a pupil edu|cated here, for a more valuable inheritance hereafter. God is his in&s;tructor; nature and revelation, rea&s;on and con&s;cience point out the le&s;&s;ons which he is to learn and practi&s;e; providence exerci&s;es the di&s;cipline by which they are enforced.</P>
<P>IN general, we are taught to place our hope in God, as our reconciled Father in Je&s;us Chri&s;t; to love him with our whole heart, and our neighbour as our&s;elves; to pur&s;ue true glory, by becoming workers together with God, in promoting, according to our abilities, the good of &s;ociety, the order, virtue and happine&s;s of mankind.</P>
<P>THE glory acquired in this way will be &s;olid and la&s;ting. It depends not on the page of hi&s;tory, nor on marble monuments. It may be &s;aid of &s;uch, their witne&s;s is in heaven, and their record is on high. It has no connexion with the opinion which the world may entertain of us; it is &s;ufficient, that the Lord knoweth who are his. The good man is &s;atisfied from him&s;elf, and rejoiceth in the pro&s;pects of that period, when the Captain of his &s;alvation &s;hall crown

with unfading glory his good &s;oldier, who in this &s;tate of trial has acted his part well, and been faithful unto death.</P>
<P>FORMAL, complimentary addre&s;&s;es we de&s;pi&s;e: You, Gentlemen, of this Ancient and Honourable Company, will excu&s;e me from every thing of the kind; and permit me to addre&s;s you with that plain|ne&s;s and &s;incerity which peculiarly &s;uit my profe&s;&s;ion and my age.</P>
<P>YOU &s;ee at once what mu&s;t be the drift of our ad|dre&s;s, if connected with the preceding di&s;cour&s;e. It is not to remind you that your Company is <HI>ancient and honourable;</HI> that it has been an ornament to your country; has furni&s;hed tho&s;e who have done honour to the character of the &s;oldier; and that veterans, who have bled in the cau&s;e of their country, have in|&s;erted their names in your rolls. The&s;e things may be mentioned as excitements to emulation. Degen|eracy is di&s;graceful. But our grand object is to con|vince you, Gentlemen, that to be good &s;oldiers, you mu&s;t be good men and good Chri&s;tians; that to be qualified to &s;erve your country effectually, you mu&s;t &s;erve the Lord Chri&s;t; and that unle&s;s this is the ca&s;e, whatever names you may a&s;&s;ume, whatever pomp you may exhibit, whatever patrioti&s;m or courage you may profe&s;s, it is all idle parade; a kind of &s;cenery, which may amu&s;e and plea&s;e for a time, but when the cur|tain drops, darkne&s;s and de&s;pair &s;ucceed.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="028069_0015_0FD68FF28DCF0CA8">
THE character of the good &s;oldier and the good citizen are e&s;&s;entially the &s;ame; religion is the ba&s;is of both. Piety is the parent of &s;ocial and per&s;onal virtue; the&s;e render men mutual ble&s;&s;ings</P>
<P>VICE di&s;&s;olves the bonds of &s;ociety; weakens the force of law; enflames and &s;ets at liberty the unruly pa&s;&s;ions of men; produces contention, confu&s;ion and mi&s;ery. Religion the rever&s;e; &s;trengthens the &s;ocial bond; gives energy to law; re&s;trains the pa&s;&s;ions; produces order, peace, and public happine&s;s. No government can be happy, no free government can long exi&s;t, unle&s;s its character is prevailingly virtuous.</P>
<P>THE good &s;oldier mu&s;t be a patriot; he loves his country, and con&s;ults her intere&s;ts; but, how con|temptible is that patrioti&s;m, which will not di&s;po&s;e a man to do the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential, and perhaps the only thing he is capable of doing for the good of his coun|try, that is, to be virtuous. We cannot all fill pub|lic, we may fill our private &s;tation, &s;o as to render it a po&s;t of honour. If we are not called to &s;how the good &s;oldier in the field, we may do it to as good purpo&s;e at home, by oppo&s;ing <HI>vice,</HI> our own and our country's greate&s;t enemy.</P>
<P>YOU, Gentlemen, are con&s;idered as our fir&s;t mili|tary corps; your example will do much towards pro|moting a military &s;pirit, giving it proper direction, and fixing the hitherto unde&s;cribable point of mili|tary honour. If you connect it with the dignity of
<PB N="18" REF="028069_0016_0FD68FFC080E4950">
religion, and the amiable forms of &s;ocial and private virtue, the effect will be happy; and within the &s;phere of your influence, the good &s;oldier, the man of hon|our, the good man, and the good Chri&s;tian will be the &s;ame. May the God of armies ble&s;s you! and may your in&s;titution flouri&s;h, till wars &s;hall cea&s;e by the prevalence of the kingdom of the Redeemer. May you keep in view and &s;teadily follow him; obey his orders; do his well; and he will certainly lead you to <HI>victory</HI> and to <HI>glory.</HI></P>
<P>THIS re&s;pectable auditory will indulge me with ob|&s;erving, that although we exclude politics from the de&s;k any farther than as e&s;&s;entially connected with re|ligion, we may be permitted on this occa&s;ion to ex|pre&s;s the gratitude we feel to Providence for that ex|cellent form of government with which our country is favoured; and for the happy effects we have derived from it for &s;ucce&s;&s;ive years; nor do we con&s;ider &s;ome difference of opinion upon political &s;ubjects as an evil; it leads to inve&s;tigation, con&s;equently to the di&s;covery of truth. That free government is in real danger which meets with no oppo&s;ition; and a dead uni|formity of opinion di&s;covers &s;uch an apathy in the public mind as threatens the death of liberty.</P>
<P>THE only evil we di&s;cover here is a want of can|dour, where different opinions are abetted. Suppo&s;e our neighbour to be in an error, why &s;hould we im|peach the heart for the errors of the head? But alas!
<PB N="19" REF="028069_0017_0FD68FFE20931C80">
where or who&s;e is the error? Is it yours? or is it mine? Let each take his &s;hare of that weakne&s;s and liability to err, which is common to us all, and de&s;|pi&s;e him&s;elf if he findeth the pride of his heart betray|ing him into an imaginary infallibility, or to think the wor&s;e of another, merely on account of his hold|ing a different opinion.</P>
<P>LET us cultivate that charity which thinketh no evil, and which by cementing our hearts will prevent the ill effects ari&s;ing from different political views. Our political hemi&s;phere has been clouded, and we have been threatened with the calamity of foreign war; but we flatter our&s;elves, that the ble&s;&s;ing of Heaven upon the prudent mea&s;ures of our national government, will di&s;per&s;e the cloud, and that the ble&s;&s;|ings of peace will &s;till be indulged to our favoured country; that her ri&s;ing glory will an&s;wer the &s;an|guine expectations and fervent prayers of her friends. But a nobler object &s;hould terminate our views; another and a better country beyond the grave. It has been purcha&s;ed for, revealed to, and urged upon us by the mo&s;t powerful motives. Let us embrace the animating hope, and under the influence of it &s;teadily endeavour to act our parts well, as good &s;old|iers of Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
