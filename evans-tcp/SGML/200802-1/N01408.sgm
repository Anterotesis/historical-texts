</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE State of the Church of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> when this P&s;alm was Penned, was very Calamitous (as appears from the Matter of the P&s;alm it &s;elf) both with re&s;pect unto <HI>Sins and Judg|ments.</HI> And the whole P&s;alm is a Prayer in the Name and Behalf of the Church, unto God for Deliverance. In the Ver&s;e before us, we may con&s;ider,</P>
<P N="1">1. THE De&s;cription of the <HI>Church Prayed for,</HI> by that Metaphor of a <HI>Vine.</HI> To Explain which we may ob&s;erve,</P>
<P N="1">(1.) THAT Je&s;us Chri&s;t Him&s;elf as Mediator, God-Man, and as Head of the Church is <HI>the True Vine,</HI> Joh. 15.1. Chri&s;t compares Him&s;elf to a Vine
<PB N="2" REF="001674_0004_0FB4E08B82FE6B20">
according to His u&s;ual Cu&s;tom of taking Simili|tudes from things Common and Obvious; &s;uch were Vines in <HI>Judea, Deut.</HI> 8.8. Planted by the &s;ides of their Hou&s;es, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 128.3. Probably of that Hou&s;e where Chri&s;t was when He &s;pake tho&s;e words. Chri&s;t is the <HI>Principal Vine,</HI> for who&s;e &s;ake the Church of I&s;rael was compared to a Vine or Vineyard, becau&s;e out of that Church the Me&s;&s;iah was to come who is the True Vine. Chri&s;t is that Vine, as God-Man, Mediator, to whom the Father hath given this Prerogative to have Life in Him&s;elf, <HI>Joh.</HI> 5.26.</P>
<P>AND to be a quickning Spirit unto tho&s;e im|planted into Him, and who are given to Him to be His Members, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 15.45. Chri&s;t is therefore likened to that which is the chief part of a Vine, Namely <HI>the Root and Stock,</HI> when as His Members are but like the <HI>Branches.</HI> Chri&s;t as He is Man is of the &s;ame Nature with the Branches, as He is God He &s;upplies the Branches with Spiritual Life and Grace. The Humane Nature of Chri&s;t is as the Conduit through which the Gifts of the Holy Spirit flow unto His People. As Mediator He both Merited Grace for Men, and Infu&s;es Grace into Men; and more truly and perfectly nouri&s;hes Believers unto Eternal Life, than a Vine doth its Branches; as an Head of influence unto them. Chri&s;t is then the true and proper Vine, others but &s;e|condarily &s;o; and depending on Chri&s;t, and de|riving all their Spiritual Life from Him; and obtaining all they have, for His Sake: And that they are Vines in any &s;en&s;e is becau&s;e God the Father to Glorify His Son, hath given them to Him in an Everla&s;ting Covenant, to be brought unto Union and Communion with Him.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="001674_0005_0FB4E08EDCF3C228">MANY Phra&s;es in this P&s;alm, may be referred to Chri&s;t; He is Gods <HI>Jo&s;eph,</HI> Ver&s;e 1. to whom belongs the Right of Primogeniture; to be the Fir&s;t born of every Creature. He is the Man of Gods Right Hand, <HI>v.</HI> 17. Gods <HI>Benjamin,</HI> who is Exalted to &s;it at Gods Right Hand, and if this glorious <HI>Benjamin</HI> were not there, we &s;hould not be admitted to &s;ee Gods face.

Who did &s;tand and feed in the Strength of the Lord and in the Maje&s;ty of the Name of the Lord his God, <HI>Micah</HI> 5.4. And as Chri&s;t in|tended to make His Church conformable to Him|&s;elf; &s;o in &s;ome re&s;pect, He would be like to His Church; therefore He would be the Branch, the Vine, the Fruit of the Earth, and would be brought out of <HI>Egypt, v.</HI> 8. <HI>Math.</HI> 2.15. So that Gods di&s;|pen&s;ations to His Church were Typical of the Me&s;&s;iah in many things: Therefore al&s;o the &s;ame Title of a Vine, comprehends both Chri&s;t and His Church; as the Name of Chri&s;t is al&s;o given to His My&s;tical Body the Church, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 12.12.</P>
<P>NOW God the Father hath Engaged Him&s;elf to be the Husbandman, when Chri&s;t conde&s;cends to be the Vine; the Father will and doth always manife&s;t His gracious Pre&s;ence with Chri&s;t as Head of the Church, to A&s;&s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t and Help Him and Strengthen Him: and out of Re&s;pect and Love to the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t it is, that the Father takes any No|tice in a way of Pity, Compa&s;&s;ion and Grace, of any Men or Societies of Men upon Earth.</P>

Vineyard; The My&s;tical Paradi&s;e of God, partly in Heaven, and partly on Earth. As God Planted an Earthly Paradi&s;e in the Garden of <HI>Eden,</HI> which did excel all the re&s;t of the Earth; &s;o &s;ince the Ruine of Mankind by <HI>Adam</HI>'s Apo&s;tacy, God will have a Remnant among fallen Mankind in every Age and Generation, to be His Vineyard, Garden, Orchard (or <HI>Eden,</HI> Eccl. 2.5.) depending on and United unto Chri&s;t, the Second <HI>Adam</HI>: For God in His Infinite Wi&s;dom &s;o ordered the things of the fir&s;t Creation, that they might be Natural Types of what He would do in the New Crea|tion of all things by Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>THE Church is Gods Vineyard, which His Own Right Hand hath Planted, <HI>v.</HI> 8, 15. It is a Gar|den inclo&s;ed, <HI>Cant.</HI> 4.12.

Tho&s;e Planted into this Vine|yard, tho' by Nature they are Wild Plants, and of the Wild Olive, yet are made Noble Vines and a Right Seed, by Effectual Calling and their Im|plantation into Chri&s;t. The Creating <HI>Power of Gods Right Hand</HI> is put forth in infu&s;ing Grace into them: Mans Nature brings not forth the fruits of the Spirit without the Skill and Husbandry of Him that made it: We are therefore called <HI>Gods Hu&s;bandry,</HI> 1 Cor. 3.9.

Variety of precious Graces and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">rtues are implanted in them which are all U&s;eful and make them fruitful in Good Works: And as the fruit of the Vine was u&s;ed in Sacrifices, &s;o the Good Fruits of Believers are a &s;weet Smelling Sacrifice unto God. They are made &s;en&s;ible that they are Weak and Worthle&s;s Creatures in and of them&s;elves, (as a Vine is not Timber fit for Service, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 15.1, 2. Fit for no|thing but to be ca&s;t into the Fire; unle&s;s it bear fruit) yet being Vines Planted into Chri&s;t Him|&s;elf, <HI>the fatte&s;t Soil</HI>; and under-propped by the Grace and Spirit of Chri&s;t Strengthning and Supporting of them; and the Excre&s;cencies of Corruption be|ing continually lopped off by their Careful Vine|dre&s;&s;er, <HI>Joh.</HI> 15.2.

<P N="3">(3.) THE <HI>Vi&s;ible Church</HI> of God on Earth is Gods Vine. And Gods Tran&s;actions with the Church Vi&s;ible do Outwardly re&s;emble the Spiri|tual and Invi&s;ible dealings of God with the Church of the Elect: and there-unto are afforded Out|ward Means&punc; and Privileges for the Saving Good of Gods Elect among them.</P>
<P>THIS Vi&s;ible Church was built upon Chri&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the Me&s;&s;iah; that fir&s;t Promi&s;e, in <HI>Gen.</HI> 3.15.

Chri&s;t hath &s;een His Seed in all Ages pa&s;t, and &s;hall &s;till <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ee His Seed in all Ages to come. The great Work of God in all Ages is to be Planting Vineyards or Churches, where there are none; and to Pre&s;erve tho&s;e Churches which He hath already on Earth, and to re&s;tore them where they are under decays. Tho' Chri&s;ts Church on Earth be a Weak and Feeble People, yet He makes them Strong for Him&s;elf, defending them again&s;t the Gates of Hell, keeping an Hedge of Protection about them, and guarding them by Armies of Angels, and &s;o caring for them that the whole World may di&s;cern, that His &s;pecial Care and gracious Providence is concerned for their Good, more than for the re&s;t of Mankind.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="001674_0009_0FB4E0988D4C7AE0">AND the Di&s;pen&s;ations of God towards <HI>I&s;rael</HI> in Tran&s;planting them out of <HI>Egypt</HI> into <HI>Canaan,</HI> and Erecting a Church State and Ordinances among them (which the former part of the P&s;alm doth mention) are in &s;ome kind of Similitude acted over again in New-Te&s;tament times in all Ages of the Church; and will &s;till be again acted over while the World continues.</P>
<P N="4">(4.) <HI>Particular Churches</HI> are the <HI>Mini&s;terial Vine|yards of Chri&s;t,</HI> for the Exerci&s;e of Divine Wor&s;hip, Ordinances, and Di&s;cipline, like &s;o many particu|lar Inclo&s;ures under the In&s;pection of particular Keepers, which make up and con&s;titute the Vi&s;ible Catholick Garden of the Church. And each par|ticular Profe&s;&s;or of Religion (whether Sound or Un&s;ound) is a Branch in Chri&s;t Vi&s;ibly, <HI>Joh.</HI> 15. And each Chri&s;tian hath a Vineyard (namely his own Soul) to keep and look after, <HI>Cant.</HI> 1.6.</P>
<P N="2">2. IN our Text is &s;uppo&s;ed, That the pre&s;ent State of Gods Vineyard then in the World, was very <HI>Di&s;tre&s;&s;ed and Calamitons.</HI> They were fed with the Bread and Drink of Tears, and that in great Mea&s;ure, <HI>ver&s;e</HI> 5. Afflictions and Sorrows were their con&s;tant Dyet, &s;o that they could not re|frain from mixing Tears with their Food: Tho' they had Scarcity of Bread; yet had Trientals, tre|ble Mea&s;ures of Tears. [<HI>Shali&s;h,</HI>] Notes a Cup four times as big as the u&s;ual Cups they drink in, &s;o that they drank Tears in Flagons, rather than in Cups.</P>
<P>THEY were made a Strife to their Neighbours, <HI>ver&s;e</HI> 6. Their Enemies Strove among them&s;elves which &s;hould make a &s;poil and a prey of them; and tho&s;e who once were Neighbourly and Kind

<P>THE Thing Prayed for then, is, A Gracious Look of Divine Providence, and Look of Pity and Com|mi&s;eration, as in I&s;ai. 63.15. <HI>Look down from Heaven, and behold from the Habitation of thy Holine&s;s and of thy Glory: Where is thy Zeal, and thy Strength, the Sounding of thy Bowels and of thy Mercy towards me?

The Vi&s;it Prayed for is that of a Father afforded to his Children, which is with Pity and Compa&s;&s;ion, with Care and Faith|fulne&s;s, as well as with Power to Help them. Such a Vi&s;it <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> promi&s;ed that God would give to <HI>I&s;rael</HI>: Gen. 50.24, 25. <HI>God will &s;urely Vi&s;it you&punc; and bring you out of this Land, unto the Land which He Sware to</HI> Abraham, <HI>to</HI> I&s;aac, <HI>and to</HI> Jacob. <HI>Exod.</HI> 3.16. <HI>I have &s;urely Vi&s;ited you and &s;een what is done to you.</HI> Exod. 4.31. <HI>When they had heard the Lord had Vi&s;ited the Children of</HI> I&s;rael, <HI>and that He had Looked on their Affliction, then they bowed their Heads and Wor&s;hipped.</HI></P>

<P N="1">1. WHEN the God of Ho&s;ts works <HI>by the Hosts of Heaven, the holy Angels,</HI> for the good of His Vine; That is a remarkable Vi&s;it. Thus after <HI>Rab&s;hakehs</HI> Railing and Bla&s;phemy, the Churches Enemies were found all dead Corp&s;es, being de&s;troyed by an Angel. Al&s;o when by the holy Angels God &s;tirs up good Motions in the Hearts of Men, and Spirits them to Engage in, and Perform &s;ome work for God. An Angel a&s;&s;i&s;ted <HI>Darius</HI> in wielding his new gotten Empire, <HI>Dan.</HI> 11.1. Angels a&s;&s;i&s;ted in rai&s;ing up and afterwards ra&s;ing to the ground tho&s;e mighty Empires of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> and <HI>Grecia,</HI> Dan. 10.13, 20, 21. All which changes on the Empires were ultimately for the &s;ake and benefit of the Church of God: for God can readily part even with an Earthly Kingdom, and give it for His Churches good: So dear and precious is His Vine unto Him: And God hath Invi&s;ible State-Mini&s;ters (even the Holy Angels) to bring about the Fates of Kingdoms and Empires.</P>

<P>EXCELLENT SIR, We Acknowledge the great Mercy &amp; Kindne&s;s of our GOD, who hath moved the Heart of the QUEENS Mo&s;t Excellent Maje&s;ty, to Im|power &amp; Improve Your Excellency, to Lead, Guide and Govern us; and that the Lord hath Pre&s;erved Your Life hitherto, and Your Abilities of doing Eminent and Remarkable Services for His Vineyard, in defending it again&s;t the Boars &amp; Wild Bea&s;ts of Heathen Adver|&s;aries, and our other Neighbouring Enemies, during the late Long War; and in Managing the Civil Affairs of this Province &s;o as that the Vineyard of the Lord of Ho&s;ts therein hath Enjoyed Tranquillity hitherto; and in giving forth Proclamations &amp; Exhortations to Your People here from time to time to Excite &amp; En|courage them to Set about the Work of REFORMA|TION; and in Countenancing and Encouraging the

Propagation of Religion, the Planting it in the dark Corners of our Land, and the Upholding of it where it was Planted. We heartily render our Thanks to Your Excellency for the&s;e Favours; and believe Your Excellency doth E&s;teem it Your Glory, and a Sufficient Reward of it Self, that the Lord of Ho&s;ts is Plea&s;ed to Accept of &s;uch Your De&s;ires &amp; Endeavours to Promote the Flouri&s;hing of His Vineyard in this Land: and that on th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e Accounts All the Churches of this Pro|vince Salute You; and Pray for You<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Pro&s;perity. God grant we may have always &s;uch a GOVERNOUR, who like <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> is daily Lifting up his Hands &amp; Heart to GOD in the Heavens, for the Pro&s;perity of the&s;e Churches: For the Fervent Prayers of Rulers keep off di&s;mal Strokes from a People.</P>
<P>NEXTLY; TO <HI>the Honourable Members of Her Ma|je&s;ties COUNCIL, and of the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives</HI>: I would only add, That as You have hitherto, &s;o We tru&s;t you will &s;till, hold on and continue in your Pious Endeavours to Promote the Flouri&s;hing of Religion in this Land, the Suppre&s;&s;ion of Vice, the Encourage|ment of Virtue, the regulating of Di&s;orders, the Com|po&s;ing of Differencies, that Ari&s;e; that you may be able to &s;ay, That All that could be done by Men in your Stations, according to the be&s;t of your Abilities, for the good of this Vine, You have Endeavoured to be found in the Performance thereof: May the Lord God of Ho&s;ts Accept of your Endeavours, and give them Succe&s;s through His ble&s;&s;ing upon them!</P>
<P>THIRDLY; TO <HI>My Reverend Fathers &amp; Brethren in the Mini&s;try:</HI> I take leave in all Humility to &s;ay, That when the Lord of Ho&s;ts intends a Remarkable Vi&s;it to His Vine on Earth, He is wont to Rai&s;e up Mini&s;ters and fill tho&s;e that are the Standing Mini&s;try in His Churches, in a more than Common Mea&s;ure with His Holy Spirit; &s;o that they are carryed forth with more
<PB N="37" REF="001674_0039_0FB4E0EC975AA340">
than u&s;ual Courage, Forwardne&s;s, Diligence &amp; Activity in their Station, for the Re&s;toring &amp; Pre&s;erving Reli|gion in their &s;everal Charges; they have at &s;uch a time peculiar Impre&s;&s;ions from Above, both as to the Sub|jects they are to handle, and as to the manner of trea|ting of them; Their Faculties &amp; Abilities are quick|ned &amp; enlivened, their Mini&s;terial Gifts &amp; Graces En|larged, their good Affections and Zeal Encrea&s;ed, and their Watchfulne&s;s over their Flocks to Promote their Spiritual Good more abundant than before; and a Spirit of Prayer is in &s;uch a Day of Vi&s;itation Poured out upon the Mini&s;try in a High Degree, and the Bent of their Souls is to Promote Religion, to Convert and Edify Souls, and they are made Re&s;olute in this Work, to Pur&s;ue &amp; Pro&s;ecute it, notwith&s;tanding all the Op|po&s;itions &amp; Di&s;couragements that attend them therein. And they are forward and ready to Reform what-ever is ami&s;s in them&s;elves, that they may become Patterns to the Flocks of Chri&s;t, Exemplary in Good Works, and as Shining Lights in a dark World. Ble&s;&s;ed be God who hath Supplyed His Churches with &s;uch a Mini&s;try hitherto; and let us all Cry to Heaven that &s;uch a Mini&s;try may be continued unto the&s;e Churches Succe&s;&s;ively; and that God will be plea&s;ed to Accom|pany their Labours with His ble&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>FOURTHLY; TO <HI>Aged Chri&s;tians</HI>: Give me leave to &s;ay; You are the Peculiar Friends &amp; Ancient Ac|quaintance of the God of Heaven, who are yet left on Earth; Oh! therefore Improve your Intere&s;t in God to Prevail with Him to Look down, and Come down, and Vi&s;it this His Vine!</P>
<P>FIFTHLY; TO <HI>the Churches of New-England</HI>: who have been &amp; are yet the Vineyard of the Lord of Ho&s;ts, who enjoy the Privileges of His Vi&s;ible Kingdom the Tokens of His Pre&s;ence, the Ordinances of His Hou&s;e; and in that re&s;pect have from the fir&s;t Founding of our
<PB N="38" REF="001674_0040_0FB4E0EEECCE8908">
Churches, and fir&s;t Planting of this Vineyard, enjoy'd a Day of Divine Gracious Vi&s;itation; and altho' we have Experienced great Decays &amp; Declen&s;ions, the lo&s;s of our Fir&s;t Love, and the Withdrawings of Gods Spirit; &s;o that the Churches &s;ometimes Complain of their Barrenne&s;s, that Few are Converted &amp; New Born to Chri&s;t, and the Work of Chri&s;t is &s;ometimes under Sen&s;ible &amp; Vi&s;ible Langui&s;hments; yet we have rea|&s;on to Ble&s;s God who gives &s;ome Revivals of His Work, &s;ometimes in One Church, and &s;ometimes in Another; and from thence &s;hould be Encouraged to plead with God for a more General Effu&s;ion of His Spirit upon all His Churches, that all Parts of His Vineyard may Flouri&s;h; even the dark Corners of our Vineyard, that they may have Wi&s;dom to Know the Day of their Vi&s;itation, and to Accept of the Go&s;pel Offered to them, and bid Welcome to Our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who Offers to come &amp; dwell among them; le&s;t they &s;hould Provoke God to Vi&s;it them in Judgment &amp; Fury.</P>
<P>LASTLY; TO <HI>Impenitent Sinners and Hypocrites:</HI> Let me &s;ay, What will you do in the Day of Vi&s;itati|on? For when God gives His Vineyard a Vi&s;it in <HI>Love,</HI> in order to its Fruitfulne&s;s; Oh! what danger are they in who are as Dry &amp; Withered Branches; they are as Thorns &amp; Bryars in the Vineyard, that hinder the Flouri&s;hing of Religion in the Places where they Live? They may ju&s;tly expect to be pluckt up by the Roots, Cut down and Ca&s;t into the Fire; unle&s;s &s;peedy Repentance &amp; Reformation prevent it.</P>
<P>Having thus after my Weak manner, given you the Explication of the Text, with &s;ome Application, as by Divine Leave and Help, Let us all as One Repeat it in way of Supplication; <HI>Return, we be&s;eech Thee, O God of Ho&s;ts: Look down from Hea|ven, and behold, and Vi&s;it this Vine.</HI></P>
