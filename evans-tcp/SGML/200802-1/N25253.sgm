<HEAD>A TREATISE, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THE prevalance of the Yellow Fever, as it is general|ly denominated, in many of the &s;ea port towns of Ame|ca, has naturally excited the attention of every cla&s;s of citizens, and drawn forth ob&s;ervations and remarks from &s;ome of our mo&s;t re&s;pectable philo&s;ophic and medical characters, to whom much prai&s;e are due; the &s;ubject however does not appear to be exhau&s;ted, it is yet &s;u&s;|ceptible of improvement. I &s;hall endeavor to place it in a new point of view, in as conci&s;e a manner as I am able. The attempt may be the means of calling forth the ob&s;ervations of others better qualified to illu&s;trate the &s;ubject. I regret that neither my abilities or &s;ituation enable me to do it that ju&s;tice which it certainly de&s;erves.</P>
<P>The origin of the di&s;ea&s;e has been variou&s;ly accounted for, and with &s;ome degree of warmth by tho&s;e who con|&s;ider it as of foreign birth, with a view to exculpate their country from the &s;tigma which attaches to a city that generates &s;o de&s;tructive a calamity. However prai&s;e|worthy it may be to endeavour to exonerate any place from &s;o &s;oul an imputation, yet we ought to be extremely cau|tious of crediting a belief in its foreign origin, unle&s;s &s;up|ported by inconte&s;tible facts, becau&s;e it may lull us into a fatal &s;ecurity, and induce us to neglect tho&s;e means of pre&s;ervation, which a contrary opinion puts us in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;i|on of. I believe it mo&s;t ju&s;t, and at any rate mo&s;t &s;aluta|ry, to con&s;ider the yellow fever as endemial to many of

our cities; becau&s;e the &s;ame means that would prevent its ri&s;e here, are preci&s;ely tho&s;e that retard and remove its pe&s;tilential effects when imported, to wit, <HI>cleanline&s;s</HI> and <HI>good air.</HI></P>
<P>The great improvements that have been made within a few years in chemi&s;try, form a new era in that &s;cience, which will mo&s;t exten&s;ively influence the practi&s;e of me|dicine, particularly in the treatment of the di&s;ea&s;e in que&s;|tion, and others of &s;imilar nature, though different in de|gree, <ABBR>viz,</ABBR> the plague, We&s;t-India, Bengal, camp, goal fever, mar&s;h fever, bilious fever, autumnal, remitting, and mo&s;t probably the common intermittent.</P>
<P>As I do not exclu&s;ively addre&s;s my&s;elf to men of &s;ci|ence, I &s;hall endeavour to dive&s;t my ob&s;ervations as much as po&s;&s;ible of technical terms, that the plain citizen, who&s;e health is his greate&s;t good, may comprehend &s;ome|thing of the nature of the di&s;ea&s;e, and of cour&s;e will be more cheerfully inclined to contribute his mite towards preventing its origin and removing its effects.</P>
<P>I propo&s;e to con&s;ider the &s;ubject under three heads or que&s;tions.</P>

</LIST>
<P>In con&s;idering the fir&s;t que&s;tion we mu&s;t examine the nature of the air we breath, or atmo&s;pheric air, and the operation breathing effectuates on the animal machine. By the a&s;&s;iduous application, and unremitted attention of &s;everal eminent philo&s;ophers and chemi&s;ts, among whom the names of Hales, Black, Macbride, Prie&s;tly, Cavendi&s;h, Lavoi&s;eir, Foureroy, Berthollet, Chaptal and De Mor|veau will not be forgotten while &s;cience is recorded. We are now able to analy&s;e the atmo&s;pheric air, which in|&s;tead of being a &s;imple element, is found to be a chemi|cal
<PB N="7" REF="033465_0006_0FF74267DCDEDA98">
compound, a knowledge of who&s;e principles becomes the more intere&s;ting, as nature has made them her prin|cipal agents in mo&s;t of her operations; which may be con&s;idered as her grand laboratory, from which the &s;eeds and pabulum of animal and vegetable life are derived, and to which their &s;ub&s;equent decompo&s;ition returns the &s;ame principles which before were extracted. The phy&s;ical properties of atmo&s;pherical air are fluidity, invi&s;ibility, gravity, ela&s;ticity, compre&s;&s;ibility, and negation of &s;mell. though foetid and odorant &s;ub&s;tances &s;ometimes affect our organs, they are to be attributed to the extraneous bodies mixed and floating in the air, which is it&s;elf perfectly inodorous.</P>
<P>From the mo&s;t conclu&s;ive and &s;atisfactory experi|ments of Prie&s;tly and Lavoi&s;ier, it is a&s;certained, that the atmo&s;pheric air will not, in its totality, maintain animal life, or promote combu&s;tion; the proportion of air that an&s;wers either of the&s;e purpo&s;es, compared with the atmo&s;pherical air, is only as 28 is to 100, which has been called by the French academicians oxigenous gas, or oxigen; the re&s;idue, or 72-100 of the atmo&s;pheri|cal air has been called azote, or nitrogene.<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Mr. Lavoi&s;ier's experiments make the atmo&s;pheric air to be compo&s;ed of 72 parts of azote, 27 parts of oxigen, and one of carbonic acid, or fixed air.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>It has become nece&s;&s;ary, that a revolution in the &s;ci|ence of chemi&s;try &s;hould be attended with a &s;imilar re|volution in its language; for it is impo&s;&s;ible to retain a vicious nomenclature when the &s;cience becomes en|lightened, extended, and &s;implified: the words u&s;ed &s;hould always identify the fact, that the knowledge of the one &s;hould always lead to a knowledge of the other. I am &s;orry here to be obliged to criticize on &s;ome of the words that have been adopted, becau&s;e they do not carry the unequivocal appropriate ideas which we have
<PB N="8" REF="033465_0007_0FF7426A158A5FB0">
a right to expect, when an innovation is introduced: the word oxigen is derived from the greek, and &s;ignifies <HI>the begetter of acid,</HI> or the ba&s;is of acidity; &s;o far the word perfectly corre&s;ponds with the fact, and probably it is from this principle only, that it is of &s;uch infinite and indi&s;pen&s;able importance to animal life: but as it is the e&s;&s;ence of life, this circum&s;tance gives it a priority of claim to &s;tand its God-father; I &s;hall therefore &s;ub|&s;titute for it the term <HI>animal vital air;</HI> this indeed does not de&s;ignate all its qualities, nor is it nece&s;&s;ary that it &s;hould; but it defines, with &s;ufficient correctne&s;s, its great leading trait&mdash;the &s;upporter of animal life: the words azote, or nitrogene, are more exceptionable than oxigen; azote is likewi&s;e derived from the Greek, and &s;ignifies <HI>without life,</HI> which is ju&s;t as de&s;criptive of the halter or the guillotine, as air: nitrogene is likewi&s;e of Grecian origin, and is meant to &s;hew, that it is the ba&s;is of nitre; that it is &s;o, I readily admit, but I am not di&s;po&s;ed to believe, that this trifling circum|&s;tance was of &s;ufficient con&s;equence to give a name to the <HI>&s;ine qua non</HI> of vegetable life; I think it ought ra|ther to have been called <HI>vegetable vital air</HI>&mdash;a name which I &s;hall take the liberty to adopt; for it is a fact as well a&s;certained, as it is po&s;&s;ible for a chemical fact to be, that in this air plants live and vegetate, without it they die: animal vital air is more ponderous than at|mo&s;pheric air, as 1000 is to 1103; vegetable vital air, on the contrary, is lighter, as 985 is to 1000; the&s;e two airs, in the proportion of 28 of the former to 72 of the latter, forms the atmo&s;pherical air, which is a che|mical compound, and is about 850 times lighter than water.</P>
<P>It is an axiom in chemi&s;try, that all &s;ub&s;tances in na|ture, whether in a &s;imple or compound &s;tate, would invariably continue in that &s;ame &s;tate, unle&s;s for a prin|ciple which pervades all creation, and is called electric attraction, or affinity of compo&s;ition: unions formed from this cau&s;e, are more or le&s;s perfect, in proportion

as their &s;ub&s;tances have a greater or le&s;s affinity for each other. I &s;hall exemplify my meaning by a &s;ub&s;tance with which we are mo&s;t of us acquainted, to wit, nitre, or &s;altpetre<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">100 <HI>parts or pounds of nitre are compo&s;ed of 30 pounds of ni|tric acid; 63 pounds of pota&s;h, and 7 pounds of water, which chri&s;talizes it.</HI></NOTE>, which is compounded of nitric acid<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot"><HI>The nitric acid is formed of 3 parts of vegetable vital air, and 7 parts of animal vital air, which was di&s;covered by a very fine experiment made by Mr. Cavendi&s;h.</HI></NOTE>, or what is commonly called aqua fortis, and pota&s;h: now it has been di&s;covered that the &s;ulphuric acid, or as it is commonly called, oil of vitriol, has a greater af|finity for pota&s;h than the nitric acid has; con&s;equently, by placing the&s;e &s;ub&s;tances in a certain temperature to|gether, a decompo&s;ition of the nitre takes place&mdash;the nitric acid is di&s;charged, and a new union between the pota&s;h and &s;ulphuric acid is formed, which is called the &s;ulphat of pota&s;h. Nitre may likewi&s;e be decom|po&s;ed in another way: it is known that Barytes, or the Terra Pondero&s;a, has a greater affinity for the nitric acid than what pota&s;h has&mdash;let them therefore be placed conveniently together, and a decompo&s;ition of the nitric is produced, the nitrate of Barytes is formed, and the pota&s;h &s;et at liberty.</P>
<P>On this principle, when any portion of atmo&s;pheric air comes in contact with any &s;ub&s;tance that has a great|er affinity with either of its component parts, than the&s;e parts have for each other, a decompo&s;ition of this por|tion takes place, and a new union is formed.</P>
<P>It is a primordial and invariable law of nature, that all and every part of creation, as well animate as inani|mate, &s;hould be in a con&s;tant &s;tate of renovation, thro' a continual circulation of decompo&s;itions, and &s;ucce&s;&s;ive generations. The wonderful di&s;coveries of the che|mi&s;ts

point out to us in the mo&s;t po&s;itive manner, that the ab&s;olute exi&s;tence of animals and vegetables depends on a mutual reciprocity of each others wants; animals ab&s;orb animal vital air, and emit vegetable vital air; on the contrary, vegetables ab&s;orb vegetable vital air, and emit animal vital air; the leaves are the medium through which this exchange is made by plants; the lungs and the excretory pores, on the &s;urface of the bo|dy, are de&s;tined to this purpo&s;e in animals&mdash;or, in other words, vegetables, when in a &s;tate of active exi&s;tence, have a greater affinity for vegetable vital air, than what animal vital air has, con&s;equently the vegetable vital air of that part of the atmo&s;pheric air which comes in con|tact with vegetables in a &s;tate of verdure, quits its con|nection with the animal vital air, and attaches it&s;elf to the plant; on the contrary, the animal vital air of the atmo&s;phere has a greater affinity for the blood of animals than it has for vegetable vital air; whenever, therefore, it comes in clo&s;e or near contact with this &s;ub&s;tance, a new union is formed: it is, however, not to be under|&s;tood as forming an union with the blood on the &s;ame principles as the &s;ulphuric acid does with the pota&s;h, previou&s;ly combined with the nitric acid, becau&s;e, in this ca&s;e, a violent efferve&s;cence takes place, in di&s;lodg|ing the nitric acid, but this union may be more aptly compared to that which takes place between quick lime and fixed air, or carbonic acid, for two rea&s;ons&mdash;in the fir&s;t place, the heat that is generated in the lime from this union, is perfectly &s;imilar to the heat of animals, which is acquired by the ab&s;orption and conden&s;ation of animal vital air<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Mr. Chaptal ob&s;erves, that re&s;piration may be con&s;idered as an operation, by means of which, vital air po&s;&s;es continually from the ga&s;eous to the concrete &s;tate; it mu&s;t, therefore, at each in|&s;tant, abandon the heat that held it in &s;olution, and in the &s;tate of gas.

<P>Every animal is furni&s;hed with lungs, or &s;omething corre&s;ponding thereto, through which the blood in con|&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion pa&s;&s;es, by which means it is brought in clo&s;e contact with the atmo&s;pheric air, and from which we now know it ab&s;orbs that part of it which we call animal vital air; after the atmo&s;pheric air has thus been re&s;pired, it lo&s;es its property of &s;upporting the lives of other animals: when an animal has died in this re&s;pired air, and another is &s;ub&s;tituted to the fir&s;t, it peri&s;hes in|&s;tantly, and in its fir&s;t effort to re&s;pire: it &s;hould &s;eem, however, that animals may, by habit, become capable, to a certain point, of breathing impure air.</P>
<P>The phoenomena of re&s;piration are but lately a&s;certained
<PB N="12" REF="033465_0011_0FF7427CC0A613A0">
though from the time of Hippocrates it has been admit|ted, that in the air re&s;ides a principle nece&s;&s;ary to life, which by him was called the <HI>pabulum vitae;</HI> this idea was connected with no hypothe&s;is; &s;y&s;tems the mo&s;t vague and void of all foundations, have at different times been held up; at one time con&s;idering the air as a &s;timulus in the lungs, which kept up the circulation; at another the lungs were con&s;idered as a bellows to cool the body, heated by a thou&s;and imaginary cau&s;es. Phy&s;iologi&s;ts of the pre|&s;ent day &s;eem to con&s;ider them as the outlets of certain putrid effluviae, which would corrupt the living body in the &s;ame manner that it produces corruption in tho&s;e that are dead. The rationale is extremely again&s;t &s;uch a theory; for is it conceiveable that the &s;ame <HI>vi&s;eus</HI> can be at the &s;ame moment performing two functions diametri|cally oppo&s;ite to each other? that of ab&s;orbing and &s;e|creting through the &s;ame ve&s;&s;els, unle&s;s they &s;uppo&s;e it &s;imilar to elective attraction, as mentioned before, where pota&s;h having a greater affinity for the &s;ulphuric acid than for the nitric acid, di&s;charges this acid with which it was previou&s;ly combined. But there is no &s;ort of ana|logy in this ca&s;e, for the matter di&s;charged from the lungs in&s;tead of being an acid, is more of an alkaline nature, mixed with carbon; which I think is very &s;ufficiently ac|counted for, on the following principles: In examining the con&s;truction of lungs, we find them furni&s;hed with two &s;etts of ve&s;&s;els, a larger and a &s;maller; through the larger the whole of the blood of the &s;y&s;tem is con&s;tantly tran&s;mitted, for the <HI>exclu&s;ive</HI> purpo&s;e of attracting ani|mal vital air from the atmo&s;phere. The &s;maller &s;ett is appropriated to the exclu&s;ive &s;upport of the lungs them|&s;elves, and to furni&s;h a con&s;iderable &s;ecretion, nece&s;&s;ary to lubricate a part which is in &s;uch con&s;tant motion, to faci|litate the return of the re&s;pired air in the atmo&s;phere; and to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> the acrimony of any heterogeneous matter with which the atmo&s;phere is frequently charged. This &s;ecretion will &s;ufficiently account for the great quantity of moi&s;ture di&s;charged in expiration. The excretory pores di&s;tributed over the whole &s;urface of the body are
<PB N="13" REF="033465_0012_0FF7428236753538">
&s;ufficiently competent to di&s;charge this duty which has been a&s;&s;igned to the lungs by our modern phy&s;iologi&s;ts.</P>
<P>It has been long an e&s;tabli&s;hed principle among phy|&s;icians, that all animals have a con&s;tant tendency to pu|trefaction; but it has been re&s;erved for our own times, to point out the cau&s;e that is capable of correcting this tendency. Borehave in his aphori&s;ms, &sect;. 83, &s;ays, <Q>in|&s;ects, fi&s;hes, amphibious creatures, birds, bea&s;ts of all kinds, and even men of their own nature, con&s;tantly in|cline to putrefaction, but never turn acid</Q> Van Swe|ten in his commentaries on this aphori&s;m &s;ays, <Q>all the known animals (except a few juicele&s;s in&s;ects, for moi&s;t|ure is required in putrefaction, and the parts of animals never putrefy if they are dried) putrefy, if expo&s;ed to the heat of an air, which &s;hall cau&s;e the liquid to ri&s;e in the Farenheitian thermometer to any degree between the 32d and the 92d. The greater the heat is within this limit, &s;o much the &s;ooner for the mo&s;t part will the putrefaction begin, for beyond the 92d degree the heat rather drys up all moi&s;ture, and &s;o hinders putre|faction, and the nearer the de&s;cending heat approaches to a like degree of coldne&s;s with that of ice, the &s;low|er the putrefaction comes on. In fi&s;hes it generally comes on very &s;oon, more &s;lowly in other animals. Nor does it appear by any experiment, that the parts of animals have ever degenerated of them&s;elves into an acid; this therefore may be taken for a general rule.</Q> It appears therefore, that one of the great charactari&s;tic differences between the animal and vegetable kingdoms, is this, that animals con&s;tantly tend to an alkaline or pu|tre&s;cent &s;tate, and vegetables to that of acidity. We have &s;een before that the two kingdoms are con&s;tantly mutual|ly correcting each others morbid tendency, through the medium of the atmo&s;phere.</P>
<P>From the&s;e premi&s;es it is ea&s;y to conceive, that when the atmo&s;pherical air in any particular place, is not from any cau&s;e &s;ufficiently replete with animal vital air, this

grand corrector of putre&s;cency, that then the animals re|&s;iding within that di&s;trict mu&s;t, more or le&s;s, become di&s;|ea&s;ed, according to their previous putre&s;cent tendency; for Boerhave ob&s;erves in his &sect;. 84, <Q>that the antecedent cau&s;es of this putrefaction, are feeding upon animal food, except the milk of grazing cattle, e&s;pecially upon in&s;ects, fi&s;hes, birds of prey, alkale&s;&s;ent vegetables; a fullne&s;s either of good blood, or of blood acceding to|wards putrefaction; the &s;trength of the ve&s;&s;els, vi&s;cera, bile, &s;tagnation, or too much agitation, through the animal motion either growing languid, or being rai&s;ed too high, great heat affecting the body frequently and long.</Q> This aphori&s;m in &s;ome mea&s;ure explains why a deficiency of animal vital air does not equally affect all tho&s;e who are expo&s;ed to it. Galen likewi&s;e lays it down as a rule, <Q>that it is always nece&s;&s;ary to remember, that no cau&s;e can effect without a predi&s;po&s;ition of the body, otherwi&s;e all who are expo&s;ed to the rays of a &s;ummer &s;un, would be &s;eized with fevers, as well as tho&s;e who u&s;e too much exerci&s;e, are pa&s;&s;ionate or grieved. Moreover all would fall &s;ick during the dog days, or die of the plague.</Q> M. Chaptal has taken notice of a fact which is of &s;ome importance, and de&s;erves to be related here; it is, that "frugivorous animals vitiate the air le&s;s than carnivorous animals," which may be account|ed for in this way, that frugivorous animals having le&s;s ten|dency to putrefaction than carnivorous animals, they re|quire le&s;s animal vital air to correct that di&s;po&s;ition; for in&s;tance, an animal fed altogether on vegetables, would be able to ab&s;orb a &s;ufficient quantity of animal vital air to prevent putrefaction, out of an atmo&s;phere that contained only 20 per cent of this principle, whereas an animal fed altogether on animal food, with a le&s;s quantity than 25 per cent, would probably be affected with a putrid or bi|lious fever.</P>
<P>A diminution of animal vital air, at a &s;ea&s;on when the thermometer is at or below 32d. may produce no bad effect; but the &s;ame diminution continuing, and
<PB N="15" REF="033465_0014_0FF7428C9C750CA8">
the heat increa&s;ing, a fever and ague may be occa&s;ioned by it: a &s;till greater increa&s;e of heat may occa&s;ion a dy&s;en|tery, a further diminution of animal vital air, and an increa&s;e of heat, the yellow fever, or even the plague it|&s;elf may be generated. The Plague, therefore, can probably never originate in a cold climate, but it may, when carried here, exert its pe&s;tilential influence, by producing an increa&s;ed decompo&s;ition of animal matter, and of cour&s;e, generating much vegetable vital air, with which the atmo&s;phere becomes &s;urcharged, whereby the animal vital air is &s;o dimini&s;hed, that the natural tenden|cy to putrefaction cannot be &s;ufficiently corrected; con|&s;equently, the di&s;ea&s;e goes on rapidly, increa&s;ing its dreadful influence, until one of the two cau&s;es intervenes to &s;top its progre&s;s&mdash;either a le&s;s di&s;po&s;ition to putrefac|tion, or an increa&s;e of animal vital air.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now adduce a few traits to corroborate this &s;y&s;|tem: Fore&s;tus<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Lib.</HI> VI. <HI>Ob&s;.</HI> 9. <HI>Tom.</HI> 1, <HI>P.</HI> 25.</NOTE> relates, that a large fi&s;h of the whale kind, of immen&s;e bulk, ran a&s;hore on the Dutch coa&s;t, nor could again reach the &s;ea, notwith&s;tanding its utmo&s;t efforts, and at length died on the &s;ands; numerous &s;pe|culators ran thither from every part. Fore&s;tus him&s;elf was pre&s;ent. The neighbouring inhabitants, not being able to remove the dead fi&s;h, on account of its prodigi|ous bulk, and neglecting immediately to divide the car|ca&s;s into &s;mall pieces, the whole putrefied, and infected the country with a horrid rancid &s;tench, in con&s;equence of which, a pe&s;tilential fever broke out in the di&s;trict of Egmont, and the adjacent parts, that carried off great numbers. This ca&s;e goes merely to one fact, to &s;hew that putrid animal &s;ub&s;tances, in a &s;tate of decompo&s;iti|on, are alone &s;ufficient to generate pe&s;tilential fevers, by &s;uper&s;aturating the atmo&s;phere with vegetable vital air.</P>

The next ca&s;e I &s;hall relate is much in point, and is recorded by Sir Michael Fo&s;ter<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Fa&s;t.</HI> 17.<HI>Burn's Ju&s;tice, Vol. II. P.</HI> 361.</NOTE>: a Mr. Clarke was brought to his trial at the Old Bayley &s;e&s;&s;ions, in April, 1750&mdash;it being a ca&s;e of great expectation, the court and all the pa&s;&s;ages to it were extremely crowded; the weather was hotter than is u&s;ual at that time of the year; many people who were in court were &s;en&s;ibly affect|ed with a noi&s;ome &s;mell, and it appeared &s;oon afterwards, upon an enquiry ordered by the court of Aldermen, that the whole pri&s;on of Newgate, and all the pa&s;&s;ages leading thence into the court, were in a very filthy condition, and had long been &s;o. What made the&s;e circum&s;tances be at all attended to, was, that within a week, or ten days at the mo&s;t, after the &s;e&s;&s;ions, many people who were pre&s;ent at Mr. Clarke's tryal, were &s;eized with a fever of the malignant kind, and few who were &s;eized recovered. The &s;ymptoms were much alike in all the patients; and in le&s;s than three weeks, the di&s;temper entirely cea&s;ed. At the time this di&s;a&s;ter happened, there was no &s;ickne&s;s in the gaol more than is u&s;ual in &s;uch places; the circum&s;tance, that di&s;tingui&s;heth this from mo&s;t of the ca&s;es of the like kind which we have heard of, &s;ugge&s;ts a very proper caution, not to pre&s;ume too far upon the health of the gaol, barely be|cau&s;e the gaol fever is not among the pri&s;oners; for, without doubt, if the points of cleanline&s;s and free air have been greatly neglected, the putrid effluvia which the pri&s;oners bring with them in their cloaths, or other|wi&s;e, e&s;pecially where too many are brought into a crowded court together, may have fatal effects on peo|ple who are accu&s;tomed to breath better air: though the poor wretches, who in &s;ome mea&s;ure are habituated to the fumes of a pri&s;on, may not always be &s;en&s;ible of great inconveniencies from them. The per&s;ons of chief note who were in the court at this time, and died of the

fever, were Sir Samuel Pennant, lord mayor for that year, Sir Thomas Abny, one of the ju&s;tices of the com|mon pleas; Charles Clarke, <ABBR>E&s;q.</ABBR> one of the barons of the exchequer, and Sir Daniel Lambert, one of the aldermen of London: of le&s;s note, a gentleman of the bar, two or three &s;tudents, one of the under &s;heriffs, an officer of chief ju&s;tice Lee, who attended his lord&s;hip in court at that time, &s;everal gentlemen of the jury on the Middle&s;ex &s;ide, and about fifty other per&s;ons, whom bu&s;ine&s;s or curio&s;ity had brought thither.</P>
<P>I have related this ca&s;e rather lengthily, with a view to make a few ob&s;ervations on it: it &s;hews that a malig|nant fever may, like the la&s;t ca&s;e, ari&s;e from putrid of|fen&s;ive matter, and a confined air: it al&s;o &s;hews that the pri&s;oners, who contributed largely to generate the di&s;ea&s;e, did them&s;elves e&s;cape its de&s;tructive influence, by being in &s;ome mea&s;ure habituated to it; for that na|ture can, and does by degrees a&s;&s;imilate our con&s;titutions to varieties of climate and atmo&s;pherical changes, are facts that con&s;tantly occur, without which the We&s;t and Ea&s;t Indies, the coa&s;t of Guinea, and the Low Coun|tries of the &s;outhern States, would be uninhabited by Europeans, or the inhabitants of the more northern and elevated parts of America. It is probable al&s;o, from low diet, the natural tendency of the pri&s;oners to putre|faction was le&s;s than that of the high fed judges, law+yers, and Middle&s;ex jurymen, who were victims to the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>This ca&s;e likewi&s;e furni&s;hes us with another fact of &s;ome importance: it &s;tates, that the di&s;ea&s;e commenced in April, and in about &s;ix weeks, that is the beginning of June, di&s;appeared. Now, from what has been before ob&s;erved, in the month of June, the natural tendency to putrefaction, from the increa&s;e of heat, mu&s;t have been much more powerful than it was in the month of April; of cour&s;e, the di&s;ea&s;e, in&s;tead of entirely cea&s;ing, ought to have increa&s;ed rapidly; why it did not, I &s;hall now
<PB N="18" REF="033465_0017_0FF7429A47F68F18">
endeavour to account. In the month of April, in nor|thern climates, vegetation is &s;till dormant, con&s;equently the atmo&s;pherical air mu&s;t then be &s;urcharged with vege|table vital air: as the &s;ummer advances, this vegetable vital air will be in great demand, for the nutriment of plants; of cour&s;e, not only a diminution of it takes place, from being ab&s;orbed by plants, but a great quan|tity of animal vital air is generated by them, and thrown into the atmo&s;phere, from whence it will be ab&s;orbed by animals, to whom it is a <HI>&s;ine qua non.</HI></P>
<P>Plants not only have the faculty of emptying into the atmo&s;phere animal vital air, by per&s;piration, but they po&s;&s;e&s;s likewi&s;e the means of throwing into circulation an immen&s;e quantity from another &s;ource, to wit, from rain and dews: to under&s;tand this aright, it is nece&s;&s;ary to premi&s;e, that from the be&s;t authenticated facts, wa|ter, in&s;tead of being a pure element, is di&s;covered to be compounded of two &s;pecies of air, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> animal vital air, and inflammable air, or, as it has been called, hydro|gene, in the proportion of 85 of the former, and 15 of the latter: now it is well known that plants have a great|er affinity for hydrogene, than animal vital air has; of con&s;equence, when water or dew fall on the leaves of plants, the hydrogene is ab&s;orbed, and the water decom|po&s;ed; therefore the animal vital air mu&s;t be thrown in|to the atmo&s;phere; the heat and light of the &s;un greatly facilitates this operation: one &s;quare inch of water contains near nine hundred &s;quare inches of animal vital air.</P>
<P>This is by no means a &s;olitary ca&s;e of a malignant fe|ver cea&s;ing in the heat of &s;ummer; the hi&s;tory of the plague furni&s;hes us with a great many: I &s;hall &s;elect two or three. When the plague raged at Aleppo, and in the beginning of July, the hotte&s;t &s;ea&s;on of the year came on, the di&s;ea&s;e remarkably dimini&s;hed; and towards the end of

<P>I have thus &s;hewn that malignant di&s;ea&s;es may ari&s;e from a combination of two cau&s;es&mdash;heat and a deficiency of animal vital air. That the yellow fever which has rava|ged many of our cities, did originate among our&s;elves, I will not undertake to &s;ay, but that the heat of our cli|mate, the filth of the &s;treets, the putrefaction in the docks, added to the inhabitants living on &s;o much animal food, are not only &s;ufficient to give ri&s;e to it, but full activity, cannot be doubted; and it is, in my opinion, a matter of no importance to determine whether the di&s;order was im|ported or not, &s;ince we have adopted it, by making it &s;o welcome.</P>
<P>I might have quoted a variety of other facts to &s;ub&s;tan|tiate the &s;ame principles, particularly the jail fever at the black a&s;&s;izes at Oxford, the ca&s;e of the unfortunate pri&s;oners confined in the black hole at Calcutta by the Nabob Surajeddoullah, &amp;c. but it would have been nearly a repetition of the &s;ame effects, produced by &s;imilar cau&s;|es. I &s;hall now proceed to con&s;ider what is the be&s;t mode of treating the yellow fever.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="033465_0019_0FF7424C42362980">
It is a great point gained always, when a phy&s;ician can indubitably fix on the cau&s;e of a di&s;order; his efforts to remove it will then be grounded on a rational practice. The yellow fever I have &s;aid, ari&s;es from a combination of two cau&s;es, a certain degree of heat, and a deficiency of animal vital air, whereby the circulating fluids acquire a &s;trong tendency to putrefaction. Of all the &s;ecretions made from the blood, none &s;o readily feel the influence of putridity as the bile, who&s;e u&s;e appears to be, from its alkale&s;&s;ent nature, to render the oily parts of the food mi&s;cible with the aqueous in the <HI>duodenum;</HI> which is the inte&s;tine next below the &s;tomach, in which the food has been previou&s;ly dige&s;ted, for the bile is never di&s;charged into the &s;tomach in an healthy &s;tate, it can get there on|ly by vomiting, or &s;ome &s;uch effect; the idea of the &s;to|mach being overcharged with bile is an error.</P>
<P>The progre&s;&s;ive effects of heat above 32d of Fahren|heit's thermometer, and a deficiency of animal vital air below 27 per cent. of the atmo&s;phere will be as follows: the blood by having too little of the principle of acidity in it, &s;ecretes bile in too large a quantity, con&s;equently in&s;tead of &s;imply converting the food to a bland chyle, its exce&s;s will occa&s;ion a fever and ague, or a dierrhoea; when the primary cau&s;es above mentioned are increa&s;ed in degree, the bile not only becomes increa&s;ed in quantity, but its quality al&s;o is materially affected; it acquires a tendency to throw the food into a putrefactive fermentation, which becomes a rotten &s;anies, and an excoriation of the bow|els takes place, which con&s;titutes dy&s;entery; or when in|&s;en&s;ible per&s;piration happens to be deficient, a fever will be induced, and will be known by the name of Yellow Fever, bilious fever, camp fever, goal fever, &amp;c. accor|ding to the place and particular accompanying circum|&s;tances; a further increa&s;e of one or both of the predi&s;|po&s;ing cau&s;es will occa&s;ion the plague.</P>
<P>In the Yellow Fever therefore, the primary object of the phy&s;ician will be as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible to empty the con|tents of the bowels, and to throw into the atmo&s;pheric
<PB N="21" REF="033465_0020_0FF680C411562FC8">
air an additional quantity of animal vital air, which is ea&s;ily procured by the decompo&s;ition of nitre. We have already &s;een, that nitre is a neutral &s;alt, compo&s;ed of pota&s;h and the nitric acid, and that &s;ulphuric acid has a greater affinity for pota&s;h than the nitric acid has; con&s;equently, by being mixed together, the nitric acid will be di&s;charged. A &s;imple and ready method is this&mdash;in a chafing di&s;h of coals, place a large gallypot nearly filled with &s;and, in the &s;and place a &s;maller gallypot about half full of &s;ulphuric acid, into which gra|dually throw nitre in powder; an efferve&s;cence immedi|ately commences, which is the &s;eparation of the nitric acid; the fumes as they immediately ari&s;e from the pot are acid and corro&s;ive, and &s;hould be avoided as not being re&s;pi|rable until more diluted in the air. This method was lately very &s;ucce&s;sfully u&s;ed at Sheerne&s;s in England, on board the &s;hip Union, in which a malignant fever had for a con&s;iderable time raged with &s;ome violence, but by the u&s;e of this means was entirely removed: It was &s;ugge&s;t|ed by Dr. Carmichael Smith, for which he was after|wards made (it is &s;aid) phy&s;ician extraordinary to the King. The principles on which he recommended it were the&s;e, he imagined that the contagion ari&s;ing from the malignant fever was occa&s;ioned by certain alkaline effluvia, di&s;charged from the bodies of the patients, that by throwing into the air the nitric acid, to be attracted by tho&s;e effluvia they were to be neutralized, and of cour&s;e rendered inert. How far &s;uch an opinion can be &s;up|ported on philo&s;ophical principles, I &s;hall not undertake to di&s;cu&s;s, for having determined not to find fault with the opinions of others in giving my own, I &s;hall not throw the gauntlet to the doctor. Nitre may be decompound|ed by heat only, which is probably the be&s;t method of doing it, as it re&s;pects a complete &s;eparation of its princi|ples, by which means it will be more &s;u&s;ceptible of new combinations. It mu&s;t be put in a retort and kept in a red heat for &s;ome time before the gas begins to &s;eparate. In ho&s;pitals, by means of tubes, the gas may be thrown into any ward; but in private hou&s;es the u&s;e of it would
<PB N="22" REF="033465_0021_0FF742A7D1061FB0">
become more difficult, unle&s;s carried there, which may ea|&s;ily be done in a machine to be mentioned by and by. One pound of nitre contains about 12,000 cubic inches of animal vital air, which is about 1-5 of its weight. Animal vital air may al&s;o be procured in large quantities and with great facility, by pouring &s;ulphuric acid on man|gane&s;e in powder, the ve&s;&s;el containing the mangane&s;e &s;hould be placed on a cha&s;ing di&s;h of coals.</P>
<P>The di&s;ea&s;e in the beginning is confined to the fluids only, it is of great importance therefore, to dimini&s;h their quantity, and repair the lo&s;s if po&s;&s;ible with tho&s;e of a more acce&s;&s;ent kind, obtained from vegetables only. On this principle, bleeding in con&s;iderable quantities is a practice well founded, and which has been recommend|ed by Galen, Botalli, Sydenham, Van Sweiten, and many others of great re&s;pectibility. There is a point however beyond which this liquid of life cannot be drawn with impunity, unle&s;s the lo&s;s could be immediately re|paired, which can be done in one or two ways only: the fir&s;t and mo&s;t natural is by food, but this unfortunately is very difficult to be done, as the patient generally loaths all food, but a &s;mall renovation can be expected from this &s;ource. From the other way great expections were once formed, though it is much to be regretted were &s;oon a|bandoned; I mean the transfu&s;ing of good &s;ound blood from the veins of an healthy per&s;on or &s;ome animal into the veins of the patient who lo&s;es a proportionate quan|tity of his bad blood. That the operation has been fre|quently performed, the books tell us. When the di&s;ea&s;e like the Yellow fever is confined to the circulating juices, the theory is rational, and de&s;erves to be con&s;idered; I give it merely as a hint.</P>
<P>I have already ob&s;erved, that vegetable vital air is gene|rated by animals, and expelled from their bodies by means of excretory ve&s;&s;els on their &s;urfaces, it is in other words a decompo&s;ition of animal matter which is di&s;charged from the body not only as u&s;ele&s;s but pernicious. In a
<PB N="23" REF="033465_0022_0FF680C5EAF3A2D0">
healthy &s;tate of the blood a retention of this matter will occa&s;ion a variety of very &s;erious evils; but in a di&s;ea&s;ed &s;tate, and particularly of the one under con&s;ideration, it is of the utmo&s;t importance that every facility be given to its outlet; whatever then will contribute to promote per&s;piration &s;hould be freely applied, and a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly per|&s;evered in.</P>
<P>I have mentioned before, that vegetable air is in a &s;mall degree lighter than animal vital air; this is to be under|&s;tood in a pure uncombined &s;tate, in which ca&s;e the ve|getable vital air would naturally tend to elevate it&s;elf above the animal vital air, but the affinity they have for each other, although it be not a &s;trong one, will naturally in|cline them to an union, which is greatly promoted by agitation. There is another circum&s;tance re&s;pecting airs or gazes which &s;hould not be forgotten, which is, that their weight depends altogether on the caloric or heat and moi&s;ture with which they are combined; wa|ter for in&s;tance deprived of its caloric becomes ice, give it an additional quantity of caloric and it becomes vapour or gas. Vegetable vital air therefore, di&s;charged from an animal by per&s;piration, being inveloped in a con&s;idera|ble humidity, will not a&s;cend from the body with that faci|lity which it would otherwi&s;e be capable of, con&s;equently the body becomes encircled with an atmo&s;phere greatly &s;ur|charged with vegetable vital air, which probably in this &s;tate may be capable of being taken into the body again by means of the ab&s;orbent ve&s;&s;els; to prevent which and to give full operation to new air that may be thrown into the &s;ick room, the vitiated air &s;hould be con&s;tantly remo|ved; it may be done by throwing a current of air on and near the bed, but which may be attended with the bad ef|fect of checking per&s;piration, which &s;hould be carefully avoided, for the rea&s;ons already a&s;&s;igned. The known compre&s;&s;ibility of airs, &s;ugge&s;ts the propriety of u&s;ing the following de&s;cribed machine, which may be called an ab&s;tractor</P>

<P>It is evident therefore, that the air may be extracted from any place wherever the point G of the flexible tube can be applied, either on the bed, under the bed, or in the bed it&s;elf, without in the lea&s;t incommoding the pa|tient. A box of 6 inches &s;quare contains 216 inches; now it is a fact well known, that air may be compre&s;&s;ed in|to a volume of 128 times le&s;s than what it commonly oc|cupies; con&s;equently a box of the above dimentions may be made to contain 27,648 &s;quare inches of air, which may be taken to the top of the hou&s;e and di&s;charged, by drawing out the pi&s;ton and forcing the valve open with an iron rod. This operation may be repeated as often as it may be thought nece&s;&s;ary, by which &s;imple contrivance the air of the room may be kept perfectly &s;weet without endangering a check to the per&s;piration.

<P>The atmo&s;phere contains, as I have already mention|ed in a note, by Mr. Lavoi&s;ier's e&s;timates, about one per cent of carbonic acid, a gas more generally di&s;tributed throughout the animal, vegetable and mineral kingdoms than any we are acquainted with; it is di&s;engaged in this form by the putrefaction of animal &s;ub&s;tances, the decom|po&s;ition of vegetables heaped together, the fermentation of wine, beer, cyder, &amp;c. by all calcareous &s;ub&s;tances, when expo&s;ed to a &s;trong heat, &amp;c. in this acid neither animals nor vegetables can exi&s;t; an animal immer&s;ed in it almo&s;t in&s;tantly dies. I do not however con&s;ider this air as deliterious or poi&s;onous, as it is generally under&s;tood, but an animal dies in it nearly on the &s;ame principles that it would do if immer&s;ed in water, that is from a to|tal deficiency of animal vital air; con&s;equently a &s;udden &s;top is put to the circulation. The lungs of the drowned per&s;on are collap&s;ed; if inflated again in a rea&s;onable time with common air, he may be reanimated. The lungs of a per&s;on &s;uffocated with carbonic acid remain inflated with this acid; of cour&s;e it becomes more difficult to re|animate him, becau&s;e this air mu&s;t be fir&s;t extracted.</P>
<P>The weight of carbonic acid, compared with common air, according to Mr. Kirwan, is as 45 to 68 nearly; from this circum&s;tance, it naturally &s;ub&s;ides to, and occupies the lowe&s;t places, from whence it may be very readily removed, by the application of a quantity of quick lime, with which &s;ub&s;tance it has a great affini|ty: 1200 pounds of quick lime will ab&s;orb about 800 pounds of carbonic acid, to convert it into &s;lacked lime; for this rea&s;on, then, a quantity of quick lime &s;hould always be kept near or under the beds of patients in the yellow fever: its application would be attended with
<PB N="26" REF="033465_0025_0FF680CC063CD510">
another advantage&mdash;it ab&s;orbs al&s;o a great quantity of, humidity, which is apt to prevail in &s;uch rooms, and which &s;hould never be attempted to be removed by fire, as fire, by its combu&s;tion, ab&s;orbs animal vital air in great quantities: the carbonic acid has been recom|mended as an anti&s;eptic remedy, but this fact wants con|firmation.</P>
<P>Having thus &s;hewn the cau&s;e of yellow fever, and the be&s;t mode of treating it, I &s;hall now proceed to the third que&s;tion, and point out the &s;ure&s;t means of pre|venting it. After &s;aying that fifth may generate the di&s;|ea&s;e, it can &s;carcely be nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay, that cleanliness in a great mea&s;ure will prevent it: an invariable attenti|on mu&s;t certainly be paid to this object, as well in per|&s;ons and hou&s;es, as the &s;treets and docks; for it &s;hould never be out of my mind, that heat and moi&s;ture are the two great agents that con&s;tantly incline all animal &s;ub|&s;tances to decompo&s;ition, which then form a gas of ex|treme expan&s;ibility, occupying the place in the atmo&s;|phere of a principle that is of the la&s;t importance to ani|mal life. It may happen, notwith&s;tanding very pru|dent care, that an exce&s;s of vegetable vital air may pre|dominate in the atmo&s;phere; you will then a&s;k what is to be done to prevent it? plant trees in every &s;treet&mdash;trees, as has been remarked before, not only ab&s;orb ve|getable vital air, but generate, in large quantities, ani|mal vital air, and decompo&s;e water. The animal and vegetable kingdoms are con&s;tantly labouring for each other, and by this admirable reciprocity of &s;ervice, the atmo&s;phere is con&s;tantly changing, and an equilibrium maintained between its con&s;tituent principles.</P>
<P>Hot, dry, and &s;tagnating air, has been ob&s;erved the forerunner of pe&s;tilential di&s;ea&s;es; that they &s;hould be &s;o, from the foregoing theory, is inevitable, for the fol|lowing rea&s;ons: heat, by dilating the texture of ani|mals, increa&s;es their natural tendency to putrefaction: drowth dimini&s;hes the requi&s;ite proportion of animal
<PB N="27" REF="033465_0026_0FF742BD91DFBEA0">
vital air in the atmo&s;phere, by not furni&s;hing the requi|&s;ite quantity of water to be decompo&s;ed by the leaves of vegetables (for water, by its decompo&s;ition, purifies the atmo&s;phere, by pouring into it &s;treams of animal vital air) con&s;equently this air, by &s;tagnation, becomes overcharged with vegetable vital air, and not being agi|tated and removed by gentle breezes, pe&s;tilential di&s;ea&s;es begin their de&s;tructive career; whenever the&s;e circum|&s;tances, in a greater or le&s;&s;er degree, &s;hall therefore oc|cur in a city, di&s;ea&s;es of a more or le&s;s &s;erious a&s;pect will be the con&s;equence; but by planting the &s;treets with trees, and procuring a &s;upply of water to &s;prinkle the &s;treets and trees occa&s;ionally in the heat of the day, it is more than probable the yellow fever will never there|after depopulate the city.</P>
<P>The local &s;ituation of New York is equal, if not &s;u|perior to any commercial city in America, probably in the world; it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es almo&s;t every thing but <HI>one,</HI> to render it the jealou&s;y of nations: when we &s;ee the ele|gance and numbers of her public buildings, the &s;plendor of her equipages, and the extravagance of her citizens, we are a&s;toni&s;hed that this one thing, which is ea&s;ily procureable, &s;hould be wanting&mdash;that is, a plentiful &s;upply of good fre&s;h water, particularly when it is known that this &s;upply may be had for about half the price that is now paid for a &s;canty &s;upply of <HI>tub water.</HI> The whole river Brunks, if it were nece&s;&s;ary, may be turned through the &s;treets of New York: nothing could po&s;&s;ibly tend &s;o much to blend the <HI>utile dulci</HI> as this; it would, in an eminent degree, &s;ecure the health and wealth of the city: it would, in fact, be its protector again&s;t tho&s;e two great &s;courges of cities&mdash;fire and pe&s;ti|lence.</P>
<P>I have before remarked. that animals living on vege|table food, do not de&s;troy &s;o much animal vital air as tho&s;e that live on fle&s;h; of cour&s;e, they do not want &s;o much; it is therefore an object of con&s;iderable import|ance,
<PB N="28" REF="033465_0027_0FF742C5CF26BD08">
to ab&s;tain, during the dog days, as much as po&s;&s;i|ble from the u&s;e of fle&s;h meats, and particularly fi&s;h: ab&s;tain al&s;o from the u&s;e of much &s;pirituous liquors, they tend to heat the blood, without correcting its pu|trid tendency; on the contrary, beer, cyder, and wines, are nece&s;&s;ary: ab&s;tain likewi&s;e from crowded hou&s;es, particularly theatres, who&s;e air is not only contamina|ted by the number of people breathing it, but the can|dles, by their combu&s;tion, tend rapidly to render it un|fit for the &s;upport of animal life. It would be a very good practice, and not attended with much expence, if the proprietors of hou&s;es of this de&s;cription, were to cau&s;e a quantity of nitre to be decompo&s;ed in them when crowded.</P>
<P>The practice of burying in church yards and vaults in New-York, has been I fear too long &s;anctioned by cu&s;|tom, to be affected by any feeble efforts of mine; but the accidents that have happened in many other places from a &s;imilar practice, will I hope be a &s;ufficient apology for &s;peaking a few words on this &s;ubject. According to Mr. Petit, a body buried four feet under ground without a coffin, will be from three to four years before it be quite decompounded, if buried deeper, the time will be longer; if buried in a coffin, it will require ten years to produce the &s;ame effect. The quantity of vegetable vital air con&s;tantly emitting from bodies previous to the above periods is great, con&s;equently combining with an exce&s;s of vegetable vital air already in the atmo&s;phere, may be the means of very &s;erious mi&s;chief; the ri&s;k however from tho&s;e cau&s;es is by no means &s;o great as from the opening of vaults in cities, the mo&s;t &s;erious evils have frequently ari&s;en from this cau&s;e. Burials then &s;hould be at &s;ome di&s;tance from a city; I have no objection that the inanimate bodies &s;hould &s;till be con&s;igned to the purveyance of the prie&s;ts, it is in many places a perqui&s;ite of the church; common decency will point out the proper interment; if you plea&s;e the burial &s;ervice for the dead may &s;till he &s;aid over it, the living may benefit from it. It appears to me how|ever,
<PB N="29" REF="033465_0028_0FF742C756502C68">
that the mode u&s;ed in Spain on this ceremony is better under&s;tood and more rational than el&s;ewhere; the bodies are decently dre&s;&s;ed, and carried on an open bier to the place of interment, into which it is placed, and with it a quantity of quick lime, which greatly facilitates the decompo&s;ition of animal &s;ub&s;tances, whereby the par|ticles compo&s;ing it are the more readily enabled to form new combinations; they will quit the &s;olitary abode of the dead, and will again be immediately brought into an active &s;tate of exi&s;tence; their fir&s;t combination will be to form vegetables, probably odorant plants and &s;weet &s;cented flowers will owe their &s;weetne&s;s and beauty to the identical corpu&s;cles that once animated our deare&s;t friends and neare&s;t relations, from whence through the medium of the atmo&s;phere they will probably again con|&s;titute the ro&s;y health and lively bloom of toa&s;ted beauty. In this rotine, for hundreds of ages, they have already in|vigorated our ance&s;tors, and for thou&s;ands more to come will probably be performing the &s;ame duty for our&s;elves. How infinitely more joyous is &s;uch an expo&s;ition of facts than the <HI>hic jacet</HI> inrollment in vaults and church yards, and the &s;olitary, gloomy and di&s;gu&s;ting &s;tate in which the prie&s;ts and ancient philo&s;ophers have &s;uppo&s;ed human bo|dies &s;ubject to. If notwith&s;tanding the&s;e facts, preju|dice and vanity &s;hould &s;till induce any to build &s;epul|chres for them&s;elves and family, the legi&s;lature &s;hould order, that bodies con&s;igned to &s;uch keeping &s;hould fir&s;t be made a mummy of, in which &s;tate they may occupy a &s;olitary nich in the gloomy dungeon, erected by big|gotry and folly, from whence on the commencement of a new &s;tate of things, they may in their mummied &s;tate, emerge to be held up to deri&s;ion, as contraveners of the laws of nature. The atmo&s;pherical air is common &s;tock, and ought not to be &s;uffered to be polluted by any man's avarice or folly.</P>
<P>Would it not be infinitely better, both for the &s;ake of humanity and commercial benefit, that when a malignant di&s;ea&s;e rages on board a ve&s;&s;el newly arrived in port, the
<PB N="30" REF="033465_0029_0FF742CF19D7FB68">
crew &s;hould be &s;ent on &s;hore to a proper &s;ituation, where nece&s;&s;ary attendance could be given them, and the ve&s;&s;el, after being &s;ufficiently impregnated with animal vital air, &s;uffered to unload, than be obliged to perform that tedi|ous expen&s;ive and ab&s;urd operation called a quarantine?</P>
<P>This naturally brings us to the con&s;ideration of a &s;ub|ject of &s;ome importance, to wit, Is the Yellow Fever contageous? By contagion I under&s;tand a &s;pecific di&s;|ea&s;e, capable of being communicated to a &s;econd per&s;on in one or two ways, either by actual contact and le&s;ion of the &s;kin, of which kind are hydrophobia, &s;yphilis di&s;ea&s;e, lepro&s;y, yaws and itch; or by the medium of the atmo&s;phere through the ab&s;orbent ve&s;&s;els, on the &s;urface of the body, of which kind are the &s;mall pox, mea&s;les, chicken pox, and hooping cough; the&s;e are all the di&s;|ea&s;es that are, literally &s;peaking, contageous according to the definition of the word as above &s;tated; but although I do not con&s;ider the Yellow Fever in all &s;ituations con|tagious, yet in certain ca&s;es it approximates &s;o near to it, that it becomes difficult to draw the line. For in|&s;tance, a man in health vi&s;iting a patient in the Yellow Fever, in an atmo&s;phere that has not more than 20 per cent of animal vital air in it, would probably under cer|tain circum&s;tances of heat and tendency, acquire the &s;ame di&s;ea&s;e; this looks &s;omething like contagion, though it be in fact very di&s;&s;imilar, for let the patient be removed to a room where the atmo&s;phere contains 28 per cent of animal vital air, and the heat and tendency are the &s;ame as in the former ca&s;e, yet he might be vi&s;ited there in per|fect &s;afety. An hundred in&s;tances of this kind might, if nece&s;&s;ary, be adduced from the hi&s;tory of the di&s;ea&s;e in Philadelphia and New-York. That vegetable vital air might be ab&s;orbed through the ab&s;orbent pores, or the &s;ur|face of the body, I think extremely probable, but under what circum&s;tances in might be done &s;o as to become in|jurious to health, I can find no facts that lean to any cer|tain conclu&s;ion. Can animal vital air be ab&s;orbed in
