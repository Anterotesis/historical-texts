<P>THAT a mean and <HI>invidious</HI> &s;et of men have look|ed upon my elevation to the rank of DIRECTOR-GENERAL AND PHYSICIAN IN CHIEF, with an <HI>evil eye,</HI> and long been concerting <HI>my removal,</HI> is a matter of which I have too &s;ub&s;tantial proof to doubt: That the un|wearied pains I have taken to &s;upport oeconomy, regu|larity and order, &s;o far as they had been introduced into the department, before it came under my management; to in|troduce, recommend and inforce them, where wanting; and to oppo&s;e and reform abu&s;es that were creeping, or had already crept into it, from the infancy of the &s;ervice, were the root of the enmity which &s;prung up again&s;t my proceedings, are no le&s;s certain. It is equally evident that it received its growth and vigour from my inflexible re&s;olution of being faithful to my tru&s;t, in not &s;uffering, &s;o far as it was in my power to prevent, the di&s;&s;ipation of the &s;tores entru&s;ted to me, for the u&s;es of the &s;ick that &s;hould be &s;ent to the General Ho&s;pital under my care, by expo&s;ing them to the wa&s;te and depredation of men who&s;e &s;chemes tended to the &s;ubver&s;ion of the General Ho&s;pital, in which they laboured to rai&s;e them&s;elves into an importance, which neither the General nor Congre&s;s ever intended, and from my putting a &s;top to tho&s;e abu&s;es of which too many of them had been guilty. That the&s;e are the &s;tock from whence have &s;hooted tho&s;e cla|mours, again&s;t me, which have been &s;o carefully culti|vated, with a de&s;ign to injure my character with the publick, under a pretence of intere&s;ting them in the &s;ufferings of the &s;ick, to which the imprudences of others had given ri&s;e; and to &s;hift the blame from them on me, I doubt not will appear to the full conviction of every impartial per&s;on, who has patience to attend to the fol|lowing Letters, Narrative, Proofs and Illu&s;tration of facts, which I propo&s;e to lay before them.</P>
<P><PB N="V" REF="015447_0003_0F998141A45F7E30">
But that my enemies &s;hould be able, with all the arts of malice, to have influenced Congre&s;s to proceed to my di&s;mi&s;&s;ion, on their partial reports, is what I had no thoughts they would have been &s;o bold, or &s;o ba&s;e, as to attempt; nor if they had, could I have imagined that they would have &s;ucceeded in their attempt.</P>
<P>The manner in which I have conducted my&s;elf in the General Ho&s;pital department; my &s;trict ob&s;ervance of the re&s;olves of Congre&s;s; my vigilance, care and activity in the duties of my &s;tation; the &s;everal plans I devi&s;ed for putting it in the power of Congre&s;s, con&s;i&s;tently with their own original &s;chemes of oeconomy, to make a bet|ter provi&s;ion for the rigimental Surgeons and &s;ick, as well as for the General Ho&s;pital it&s;elf; the advices I have communicated from time to time to &s;everal of the mem|bers, concerning the &s;tate and wants of the &s;ick, and of the regimental Surgeons; the evils I have foretold were likely to en&s;ue, and the remedies I pointed out in time to prevent many of them; and la&s;tly, the toils and dan|gers to which I have continually expo&s;ed my&s;elf in di&s;|charge of my tru&s;t, I concluded would always be a &s;uf|ficient &s;hield to protect me from every a&s;&s;ault, till I could have notice of the de&s;igns and movements of my enemies, been prepared for my defence, and have had time to have repelled them. Tho&s;e in&s;tances of zeal, diligence and uprightne&s;s of conduct, I hoped, were &s;uch, as neither malice could &s;candalize, nor envy mi&s;|intrepret.</P>
<P>Will it be believed in a future day, that &s;o grave and illu&s;trious a &s;et of men, as compo&s;e the American Con|gre&s;s, &s;hould, on any partial repre&s;entation, without giving the per&s;on accu&s;ed an opportunity of exculpating him&s;elf from the charges brought again&s;t him, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> know|ing what he was accu&s;ed of; and without calling on him to offer what he had to &s;ay, why he &s;hould not be &s;o dealt with; making them&s;elves judges as well as hear|ers, pa&s;s &s;entence, as if all that is &s;aid, is proved?

What reparation can be made for &s;uch a ha&s;ty judg|ment, if it is found to be &s;o? Can any future inquiry into the merits of the cau&s;e wholly extingui&s;h its fatal influence? Is there a tribunal in the world that has pa&s;t &s;entence without a trial, that one may pronounce a proper tribunal, to which an innocent man may &s;afely appeal? The higher the tribunal, the more fatal is the influence of prejudices. Has not the part the Congre&s;s has taken, in my di&s;mi&s;&s;ion, a direct tendency to weaken and corrupt the proper evidences? Can witne&s;&s;es that might be called in be &s;o impartial, as to give a full and faithful te&s;timony in favour of the accu&s;ed per&s;on? Will they readily produce &s;uch proofs in his favour as they could do, that might tend to applaud his conduct, whom Congre&s;s, by a re&s;olve, has thought fit to cen&s;ure; e&s;pecially when tho&s;e witne&s;s have their reliance on that Court, for pre&s;ent rank and future promotions? Is there a more effectual bribe to &s;top the mouths of evidences in favour of an innocent man, and to rai&s;e up enemies again&s;t him? How unhappy then mu&s;t be the &s;ituation of any one, which lays him under &s;o great an inconve|nience, that tho&s;e who have it in their power to ju&s;tify his conduct, may be intimidated from doing it, fully and freely, as they wi&s;h to do, for fear of giving offence to tho&s;e on whom they are dependants; &s;o that it is ea&s;ier for tho&s;e who incline to it, to do an innocent per&s;on a mi&s;chief, than to find many men &s;o ju&s;t, as to produce all they know in his behalf, and, by vindicating him, incur the disfavour of tho&s;e in power?</P>
<P>Under tho&s;e circum&s;tances a man's defence mu&s;t be liable to mi&s;con&s;tructions; whereas, had an inquiry been allowed, before di&s;mi&s;&s;ion, full weight would have been given to the evidences on both &s;ides; but by this &s;ummary and unu&s;ual proceeding, is not the door &s;hut again&s;t impartial ju&s;tice; and &s;hould the per&s;on be called to trial, before the Bench that condemned him, are not his Judges become a party again&s;t him? In who&s;e favour they are likely to pa&s;s judgment, on reference, let the feelings of mankind determine!</P>
<P><PB N="VIII" REF="015447_0006_0F9981432CA81160">
Notwith&s;tanding I was fully &s;en&s;ible of the force of the&s;e rea&s;onings, yet &s;o con&s;cious was I of my innocence, and &s;uch was my opinion of the incorruptibility of the Congre&s;s, that, rather than lay under an imputation that affected my character, dearer to an hone&s;t man than life it&s;elf, on the fir&s;t notice of my removal from office, I immediately appealed to the Commander in Chief and to Congre&s;s, in hopes they would recon&s;ider what had been &s;o ha&s;tily done again&s;t me. Three months are elap&s;ed &s;ince that appeal, nor have they thought &s;it to give me any an&s;wer.</P>
<P>To what other cau&s;e can I impute it but their own reflexions, that there is not a &s;et of men on earth, &s;o free from the influence of their own pa&s;&s;ions, that a per&s;on may tru&s;t him&s;elf to their deci&s;ions, unheard, and to whom it is proper to appeal from their own deci&s;ions, thus made? For who are &s;o free from bia&s;s, as not to have a &s;ecret wi&s;h to find, that, in pa&s;&s;ing judg|ment, they were ju&s;t. Can it be their de&s;ire to find that man blamele&s;s, to whom they have behaved, as if they thought him otherwi&s;e? Would it not be a reflexion on their ha&s;ty judgment, when they have treated him, as guilty, to find him wholly innocent?</P>
<P>But I will not do that Honourable Body the inju&s;tice to entertain a &s;u&s;picion &s;o derogatory to them, as to con&s;ider my di&s;mi&s;&s;ion, and the manner of it, as a re|gular, deliberate act of the Whole Body, or what they approved. I have heard it alledged, in their defence, again&s;t &s;o injurious a &s;uppo&s;ition, that many of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">&s;t re&s;pectable Members were ab&s;ent; that &s;ome of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> States were not repre&s;ented at the time; and that &s;everal of the Members were wholly opo&s;ed to it; that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> was an act into which they were &s;uddenly forced, by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> clamours of a party, whom political nece&s;&s;ity, at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> time, compelled them to gratify.</P>
<P>But &s;uch is my opinion of the integrity, and &s;uch my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">iance on the honour of the C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters">e&s;s, as to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> when they are furni&s;hed with the materials for judging

properly, they will be as ready to do me ju&s;tice, as a part of them have been to li&s;ten to the malice and mi&s;|repre&s;entation of my adver&s;aries; and to &s;hew their magnanimity, by allowing that they have been capable of an error, by their readine&s;s to redre&s;s it. The&s;e con&s;iderations have induced me to print &s;uch an ac|count of my proceedings, a may enable them, and the publick, to &s;ee with clearne&s;s, and judge with conviction, on the propriety or impropriety of my conduct; and to put it in their power to condemn, or acquit me, on &s;uffi|cient evidence.</P>
<P>To &s;uppo&s;e, as &s;ome have been inclined to think, that Congre&s;s can object to this appeal, from their judg|ment, to that of the publick, would be a greater reflex|ion, in my opinion, on their ju&s;tice, and do more inju|ry to that veneration we are bound to pay their virtue and wi&s;dom, than I think any Advocate of Liberty will date to offer &s;o re&s;pectable a Senate Would it not be incompatible with every idea of that liberty and ju&s;tice for which America is now in arms, to di&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">allow an ho|ne&s;t freedom of defence and expo&s;tulation, or to &s;hut up the channels of communicating intelligence, by which the publick may be truly informed of the pro|priety of their proceedings, if they mean to maintain the confidence of tho&s;e who have &s;urrendered to them their power and rights, not for their own, but the pub|lic good? Without this is allowed, all our priviledges are but an empty boa&s;t, "<HI>the ba&s;ele&s;s fabrick of a vi&s;ion,,</HI>" to which we are &s;acrificing the mo&s;t &s;ub&s;tantial realities.</P>
<P>Out of re&s;pect to Congre&s;s. I have thus long deferred my application to the publick. I can no longer, con|&s;i&s;tently with my reputation, defer it. The wounds that are given by the envenomed tongue of calumny are deeper, and more fatal than the &s;word; they de&s;troy what is dearer than life, reputation and peace of mind; blemi&s;hes on a man's public character &s;oon fe&s;ter, and if not &s;peedily removed, will contaminate every thing about him, and infect the very air he breathes. He who&s;e
<PB N="X" REF="015447_0007_0F998144110358C0">
reputation is injured, is ever &s;u&s;pected; his &s;ociety is &s;hunned; he is looked upon as dangerous, as a walking pe&s;tilence. I mu&s;t not therefore pa&s;s over, in &s;ilence, a proceeding which &s;trikes &s;o home at my honour. It would afford room for ingenious architects to rai&s;e a pile of plau&s;ible charges, which &s;ilence is no ways calcu|lated to refute. Evil reports are apt to &s;pread like wild fire, and even per&s;ons not ea&s;ily inclined to it, by re|peating and circulating a &s;tory, &s;now ball it from hand to hand, whence it cannot fail to accumulate; and where &s;landers have been &s;uffered to take root, there are never wanting &s;ome per&s;ons, who will u&s;e all kinds of manure to quicken the growth. And though my Friends are di&s;po&s;ed to look upon me as an innocent and injured per&s;on, yet I do not de&s;ire that they, or the world, &s;hould &s;et down &s;atisfied with a bare pre&s;umption of my inno|cence, as my enemies have with that of my guilt. I ra|ther wi&s;h them to unite, in calling on me, to per&s;i&s;t in dragging from their dark retreats, and chaining down tho&s;e barking CERBERI, tho&s;e pe&s;ts of &s;ociety, who lay in wait to prey on the reputation of others; and to pro|ceed in laying open my conduct, and their evil machina|tions, &s;o long as any doubt remains of either, and the means of obtaining and communicating evidence on the facts, are within my power.</P>
<P>Before I enter upon the ta&s;k, may I be permitted, with|out offence, to guard again&s;t a mi&s;take that &s;ome may, perhaps, otherwi&s;e fall into. They may &s;uppo&s;e, from the pains I am taking to vindicate my&s;elf from ground|le&s;s imputations, that I wi&s;h, or aim to be re&s;tored, the place from which I have been removed; and that I ought rather, on the fir&s;t appearance of the inju&s;tice done me, to have re&s;igned my commi&s;&s;ion, by which I might have freed my&s;elf from much trouble, and have a|voided the public di&s;cred it of being removed from it. After I have given &s;uch evidence, as I have done, of the rea|dine&s;s with which I con&s;ented to &s;erve my Country, at the fir&s;t call, as a proof of my principles, and of my
<PB N="XI" REF="015447_0007_0F998144110358C0">
obedience to their commands, I flatter my&s;elf I may, without offence, be allowed to acquaint the world, that, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the very fir&s;t intimation I ever received of the com|plaints made to Congre&s;s, I called for an immediate hearing. The honourable Member who informed me of them, gave me a hint of re&s;ignation being the mo&s;t advi&s;eable &s;tep to be taken, in the like circum&s;tances, to quiet tho&s;e clamours. Could I have fir&s;t vindicated my innocence. I &s;hould have re&s;igned with plea&s;ure, for I had not the remote&s;t wi&s;h to continue in an office that was &s;o intolerably burden&s;ome, when there was &s;uch want of di&s;cipline to inforce tho&s;e regulations, which both the Congre&s;s and Commander in Chief thought were be&s;t; nor did I think a &s;ervice that, for want of di&s;cipline and &s;uitable provi&s;ion, was in a &s;tate of the ut|mo&s;t anarchy and confu&s;ion, &s;o very honourable, as to have a de&s;ire to remain in it, one moment longer, than by &s;o doing I could be u&s;eful to my Country.&mdash;But had I re&s;igned, before I had been favoured with an examina|tion into my conduct, it might rather have prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the world with an opinion, that there was &s;ome ground for tho&s;e clamours again&s;t me, of which I was no ways con&s;cious. I determined, therefore, to in&s;i&s;t on an in|quiry into my conduct, and having fully vindicated it, to have clo&s;ed with their permi&s;&s;ion to re&s;ign, had it been allowed me to do &s;o.</P>
<P>I &s;hould then have rejoiced to have e&s;caped from that &s;cene of confu&s;ion to which I had been &s;o long a witne&s;s, and in which I could not be u&s;eful, to my former &s;ta|tion, in private life. On this ground I con&s;ider my di&s;mi&s;&s;ion, not only as more honourable than a re&s;igna|tion, without a previous ju&s;tification of my conduct, but than a continuance in office, under the circum&s;tances I have been in, almo&s;t ever &s;ince I accepted that com|mi&s;&s;ion. But I particularly rejoice in it, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> affords me an opportunity of vindicating my conduct, not only to the Whole Congre&s;s, but to the Whole World, and
<PB N="XII" REF="015447_0008_0F998144ACBCA300">
having done it, I leave the event to that God who rules the world, and in who&s;e hands are all our ways.</P>
<P>Every thing I deem nece&s;&s;ary, at pre&s;ent, for my full ju&s;tification, is contained in the following letter to a friend at Philadelphia, my memorial to General Wa&s;h|ington, and the letters and re&s;olves of Congre&s;s, with the proofs and illu&s;trations that are &s;ub|joined in the appendix. I &s;hall make no other apo|logy for laying them before the publick in that form and order, than that I think them the be&s;t adapted to give both Congre&s;s, and the publick, full information of the nature of my conduct; and if, in the cour&s;e of my narrative, the facts I adduce, and the remarks which ari&s;e upon them, &s;hould &s;eem to glance obliquely on any particulars, I hope I may be allowed to plead that the treatment I have met with, and the nature of my vindi|cation, requires freedom, and that I &s;hall be excu&s;ed in the eye of rea&s;on, and with every candid mind, if I do not &s;mother the truth and thereby weaken my defence, merely to avoid giving pain to any.</P>

New-York, who, as the object of my peculiar care, were conveyed to the Jer&s;ies, for their greater &s;afety and bet|ter accommodation.</P>
<P>At this very juncture, it was the General's plea&s;ure that I &s;hould proceed to Hackin&s;ack, on the We&s;t &s;ide of the river, to e&s;tabli&s;h other ho&s;pitals for the increa&s;ing &s;ick. I applied to him, to know in what light I was to con&s;ider tho&s;e re&s;olves; and whether, con&s;i&s;tently with them, I could continue to e&s;tabli&s;h ho&s;pitals, or provide for the &s;ick, that &s;hould be carried from the Ea&s;t to the We&s;t &s;ide of the river, &s;o that they &s;hould remain under my own care and &s;uperintendence, or whether I was not by tho&s;e re&s;olves to be deprived of the only ho&s;pi|tals I had, that were fit for the accommodation of the &s;ick and wounded, and of the principal ho&s;pital &s;tores <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> had left, that I could command; they being, at the retreat from New-York, &s;ent to Newark, the only place where they could be di&s;pen&s;ed with &s;afety and con|venience for the u&s;e of the troops on New-York i&s;land, and in its neighbourhood.</P>
<P>But General Wa&s;hington and General Green, who was pre&s;ent, gave it as their opinion, that the re&s;olves of Congre&s;s extended only to di&s;tingui&s;h the two armies, for which &s;eparate ho&s;pitals were to be e&s;tabli&s;hed; that I was directed to e&s;tabli&s;h one for the &s;ick and wounded of General Wa&s;hington's army, that was po&s;ted on the Ea&s;t &s;ide of Hud&s;on's-River; and that the other gentleman was to take care of the &s;ick of the flying camp, and &s;uch other of the troops, as happened to be then on the Ea&s;t &s;ide of the North-River, which was only a temporary &s;tation. This view of matters, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, compo&s;ed my apprehen&s;ions at that time. I was unwilling to admit the &s;uppo&s;ition that Congre&s;s, which, I was bound to think, wi&s;hed order and &s;ubordi|nation to be kept up in every department of the army, intended that he &s;hould interfere with my power, and &s;uperior appointment of Director-General, though, for the &s;ake of pre&s;ent convenience, he might be ordered to
<PB N="XXIII" REF="015447_0013_0F998148AFAB7208">
make his report directly to Congre&s;s. I therefore conclud|ed, as well from the con&s;truction put upon it by the Gene|rals, as from the rea&s;onablene&s;s of the thing it&s;elf, that I was not prohibited from fixing ho&s;pitals, either on the ea&s;t or we&s;t &s;ide of the river, as be&s;t an&s;wered for the army po&s;ted on the ea&s;t &s;ide. I could not conceive that the lives of the men, that compo&s;ed that army, were to be &s;acrificed, by a limitation of the place in which they were to be taken care of, or that a plan was laid for reducing me to a mere cypher, and to throw the whole power of the department into the hands of an inferior officer, as Doctor Shippen certainly was, however he might affect an equality.</P>
<P>Agreeable to this inference, I repaired to Hackin&s;ack, by the General's order, to direct the nece&s;&s;ary provi&s;ion to be made, for the reception and accommodation of the &s;ick, from York i&s;land, and directed a &s;econd divi&s;ion of the Ho&s;pital Surgeons, of my immediate department, to attend, and take the care of them.</P>
<P>Although I never was allowed to be ab&s;ent from the army, and &s;carcely permitted to be at any di&s;tance, for the &s;horte&s;t time, from Head-Quarters; yet the great weight of providing for, and taking care of the &s;ick of the whole army, re&s;ted on my &s;houlders alone; and yet my hands were &s;o tied up by re&s;olves of Congre&s;s, and general orders, as to leave little freedom for proper ex|ertions. In particular, I had no Deputy or A&s;&s;i&s;tant under me, to &s;hare any part of the burden of my de|partment, however exten&s;ive. One Surgeon and five Mates were all that had been allowed me, from the be|ginning to this time, for every five thou&s;and men; when at lea&s;t one thou&s;and men, in every five, were &s;ometimes con&s;idered as unfit for duty. And though I was called upon, as if I was a Commi&s;&s;ary, to attend to the daily pro|vi&s;ion returns of all the &s;ick in the army, &s;pread thro many miles, not only of the ho&s;pital, but the regimental &s;ick, and to provide them with accommodations, as a Barrack-Ma&s;ter, and with ho&s;pital furniture, as a Quarter-Ma&s;ter,
<PB N="XXIV" REF="015447_0014_0F998149E3664D38">
and that, contrary to the re&s;olves of Congre&s;s (&s;o igno|rant and unrea&s;onable were the Regimental Surgeons, and even &s;ome of the militia Generals, in requiring it) yet I had no other aid, than what could be afforded me by tho&s;e gentlemen, who had only the rank and pay of Ho&s;pital Surgeons, but who were obliged to do the duty of Deputy Directors, for which I wi&s;hed them to be cloathed with more power, than they were entitled to, when acting under the &s;imple commi&s;&s;ion of Surgeons.</P>
<P>Perhaps artful men may here alledge, that I ought, therefore, to have &s;ubmitted to the difficulty, and di&s;|charged my care of the &s;ick, of the army, on the we&s;tern Director. I would a&s;k them for what purpo&s;e, whether to bury him with the load, when he could no more take care of the &s;ick of the flying camp only, than I could of the whole army, unle&s;s by depriving me of my own offi|cers and &s;tores; or was it, to reduce me to a cypher, in order to rai&s;e him into importance? Had the Congre&s;s &s;uppo&s;ed that I had too much, and he too little to do, I would cheerfully have transferred to him the &s;uperin|tendence, and management of as many, as his heart de&s;ir|ed, only re&s;erving my rank, and the command of my own officers, ho&s;pitals and &s;tores. But I have good grounds to believe, that his underhand attempts to in|terfere with me, in my department, and his intere&s;t with a partirular &s;et, which has been employed to effect my removal, with a view to promote his de&s;ign of &s;ucceeding me, have operated more powerfully to accompli&s;h it, than all others, that have been held up, as the o&s;ten&s;ible cau&s;es of my removal; which, however he may think, from being tran&s;acted behind a curtain, they lye conceal|ed, can be ea&s;ily traced to their author, and are of a ti&s;&s;ue with the re&s;t of his conduct towards me, on &s;imilar occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>But whil&s;t I was left de&s;titute of help, what a&s;&s;i&s;tance was allowed, in the mean while, to the Director of the flying camp? I was well a&s;&s;ured, from his own lips, that he had not long acted in that &s;tation, before he wa&s;
<PB N="XXV" REF="015447_0014_0F998149E3664D38">
complimented with the appointment of a deputy, having the rank, title and pay of A&s;&s;i&s;tant-Director, or, as he told me, however &s;trange and incon&s;i&s;tent it may ap|pear, of A&s;&s;i&s;tant-Director-General. Thus it fares with the man, I will not &s;ay as Ham&aacute;n did, whom the king delights to honour; but whom governing connexions chu&s;e to make con&s;iderable, at the expence of others.</P>
<P>However this was effected, whether by his own fore|ca&s;t, or that of his friends, will any man pretend to &s;ay that this appointment, and the manner of wording the re&s;olves of Congre&s;s, October 9th, did not &s;erve the purpo&s;es of ne&s;t eggs, on which to brood and hatch de|&s;igns, not thought of by Congre&s;s, as a body? What will indifferent men think of the&s;e re&s;olves, &s;o contrary to my commi&s;&s;ion of Director-General, October 17, 1775, and the report of Congre&s;s, Augu&s;t 20th, to e&s;|tabli&s;h my rank beyond di&s;pute? See the appendix, page 30.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t &s;uch an auxiliary appointment is made to give weight and importance to a temporary Director of a fly|ing camp; and re&s;olves procured afterwards, to rai&s;e him to greater importance, and to bring me down to a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> level; and when &s;ub&s;equent mea&s;ures are taken, to di&s;|po&s;&s;e&s;s me of the powers of action, to tye up my hands, and yet to make me accountable for misfortunes, beyond human reach to prevent, and for the mi&s;conduct of others; to transfer my &s;tores, my ho&s;pitals, my &s;urgeons and officers, to another; and yet blame me for the con&s;e|quences: who is &s;o blind as to &s;ee no de&s;igns in all this or &s;o wilful, as to a&s;cribe the whole to mere accident? Is it not manife&s;t, that the Director and his attachments, have, from his fir&s;t coming into the &s;ervice, pur&s;ued &s;uch mea&s;ures, as they conceived were be&s;t calculated to rai&s;e him over the &s;houlders of every man who &s;tood in his way, and to con&s;titute him Head of the depart|ment. How truly Machiavelian has been his conduct, and tho&s;e who have a&s;&s;i&s;ted him, <HI>per fas atque ne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">as,</HI> to accompli&s;h his ends, whether right or wrong, to make

all things &s;ub&s;ervient to them; "to couzen and deceive, &s;o long as it an&s;wered any purpo&s;e, and might contribute to what he de&s;ired upon motives, how foreign &s;o ever; and when that failed further to &s;erve his purpo&s;es, to compell &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, by force, to what per&s;ons are not able to oppo&s;e? How con&s;i&s;tent is &s;uch conduct with &s;uch principles? Where men have entertained de&s;igns, that are void of all con&s;cience, they mu&s;t not think to pro&s;ecute them, by the rules of con&s;cience, which was laid a&s;ide, or &s;ubdued, before they entered upon them; and mu&s;t make no &s;cruple of doing all tho&s;e things, which are nece&s;&s;ary to compa&s;s that, to which they have devoted them&s;elves."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Machiavel's political principles.</NOTE> I am per&s;uaded, that both he, and his adherents, have not only watched for, but made oc|ca&s;ions, to &s;erve as a plau&s;ible pretext, for di&s;placing me, to accompli&s;h their own wi&s;hes. I am not more a&s;&s;ur|edly convinced of my own exi&s;tence, than I am fully per&s;uaded, that had any other per&s;on been Director of the flying camp, and were it not for that object, no clamours of the &s;ufferings of the &s;ick, which were trumpeted through every State, nor any other charge of mi&s;man|agement, would have been laid at my door; or that I &s;hould have had an opportunity given me of being heard in my defence, and that my conduct would have been fully vindicated, and my reputation for diligence and fidelity, in the di&s;charge of my tru&s;t, have been e&s;|tabli&s;hed, beyond the reach of calumny.</P>
<P>That I may not &s;eem to advance this, without a rea|&s;on, I &s;hall not place the whole &s;tre&s;s of the argument upon the &s;ingle circum&s;tance of no particular charge being ever made known to me, by Congre&s;s, although I repeatedly applied to know what was the accu&s;ation, and who were my accu&s;ers, and no other per&s;on was ever called upon, in the department, none accu&s;ed, or &s;ought after, as if I was an&s;werable, not only for every &s;uppo&s;ed crime that could be alledged again&s;t any part of it but for mere misfortunes; on which I have been proceeded again&s;t, and treated in a manner, that, I believe, has no precedent: I
<PB N="XXVII" REF="015447_0015_0F998149EA144B08">
&s;hall produce &s;uch circum&s;tances, as, I tru&s;t, will con|vince impartial men, that the o&s;ten&s;ible cau&s;es of my di&s;|mi&s;&s;ion, were not the true ones; and that Congre&s;s had, in fact, no well grounded charge, to ju&s;tify the mea&s;ure, which &s;ome per&s;ons were &s;o re&s;olutely bent upon, as to be afraid, if I were admitted to an hearing, their de&s;igns, of effecting my removal, would have been fru&s;trated. I think the one I have already pointed out will be found, on an impartial inquiry, to be the <HI>conditio &s;ine qua non;</HI> or rather, the efficient cau&s;e of that event; I mean that I &s;tood in the way of an ambitious man, whom his adherents determined, be the con&s;equences what they might, to rai&s;e to the fir&s;t rank in the depart|ment, and either oblige me to bend, as a reed, before him, or, like a &s;tubborn oak, to be torn up by the roots, for re&s;i&s;ting the tempe&s;t; and to plant him on my ruin.</P>
<P>I had intimations given me, more than once, that pains would be taken, to deprive me of my rank and di&s;tinction, to make room for a ri&s;ing competitor. I did not readily believe, yet did not wholly di&s;credit the in|telligence. I wrote to &s;ome members of Congre&s;s, whom I looked upon as my friends, to guard again&s;t any &s;tep, which, through &s;eeming inattention to military rules, might make it impracticable, con&s;i&s;tent with tho&s;e rules, as a man of &s;pirit, to remain in the &s;ervice. I told them I did not &s;eek for any extent of power, nor was I aver&s;e to any limitation of it, in my own ca&s;e, compatible with that &s;en&s;e of honour, which is &s;uppo&s;ed nece&s;&s;ary to ac|tuate and quicken men, in every army. I did not know, till I received a letter from the Secretary of Con|gre&s;s, to rectify that mi&s;take, that rank, precedence and honour, are all non&s;en&s;e, and not looked for in our ar|my; and truly, if we may judge from effects, they carry too much conviction, that a &s;en&s;e of honour is no virtue, in his e&s;timation, whatever it may be in that of &s;ome men, of a more liberal way of thinking, both in Congre&s;s and in the army. I took the liberty to write to the Pre&s;ident of the Congre&s;s, him&s;elf, "that I hoped there would be
<PB N="XXVIII" REF="015447_0016_0F9981504F5F64F0">
no unnece&s;&s;ary abridgement of rank and authority in my per&s;on, whil&s;t I continued in office, that was nece&s;&s;ary for the head of the department, in the per&s;on of my predece&s;&s;or, and was con&s;i&s;tent with real u&s;efulne&s;s, to which I expre&s;&s;ed it to be my de&s;ire, that every other con&s;ideration &s;hould give way, as it would imply a re|flexion upon me, which I was unwilling to &s;uppo&s;e I merited."</P>
<P>I al&s;o wrote to the Secretary of Congre&s;s, on a double account; fir&s;t, to know the extent of my power, and that of the &s;everal Directors, for the &s;ake of conducting bu&s;ine&s;s in its proper channel; and next, to get that rank, which was allowed me by Congre&s;s, properly re|cognized by the &s;everal Directors, to avoid mi&s;takes. Dr. Stringer, one of the Directors, had not only di&s;|puted it with me, and refu&s;ed to make his returns to me, as Director-General, as Congre&s;s required; but appealed to Congre&s;s for its deci&s;ion, which was given in my favour. <HI>See appendix, page</HI> 30.</P>
<P>Although my application to him was re&s;pectful, and as I informed him, only made with a view to know my &s;tation, and that of others, that I might perform the du|ties expected of me, without interference with any; in|&s;tead of favouring me with any extract from the re&s;olves of Congre&s;s, to which I referred for information, he &s;aw fit to &s;ub&s;titute his own dictates, in place of tho&s;e of Congre&s;s. See page 149, 150, &amp;c.</P>
<P>My rank and authority being &s;ecurely fenced in, by repeated acts and re&s;olves of Congre&s;s, there was no po&s;&s;ibility for the Director of the flying camp, or his friends, to accompli&s;h their &s;ecret purpo&s;es, without fir&s;t breaking down the &s;eparating wall of di&s;tinction. By this means, the per&s;on, who would not &s;ubmit to be de|graded from his rank, would be obliged to re&s;ign, and, to in&s;ure &s;ucce&s;s, it was ea&s;y for artful per&s;ons to ex|cite or encourage complaints, and to bring them before Congre&s;s, to afford a pretext for di&s;placing him. But then it was of con&s;equence, that he &s;hould be kept ig|norant
<PB N="XXIX" REF="015447_0016_0F9981504F5F64F0">
of tho&s;e complaints, and of his accu&s;ers, and to prevent his obtaining an hearing, le&s;t he &s;hould vindicate him&s;elf, and thereby di&s;appoint their hopes. Nothing could an&s;wer their purpo&s;es better, than to pu&s;h for ob|taining his di&s;mi&s;&s;ion, without a trial, which might enable him to clear him&s;elf from all a&s;per&s;ions, and ju&s;tify his conduct in the face of Day, to the confu&s;ion of his enemies.</P>
<P>After this detail of facts, compared with the &s;everal re&s;olves of Congre&s;s, and the proceedings thereon, with the relation I am about to give of the particular beha|viour of the Director, in con&s;equence of them; let every impartial man lay his hand upon his heart, and a&s;k him&s;elf, ingenuou&s;ly, what he thinks of the whole matter, and of the &s;everal appearances, which concur, in an uniform &s;eries to point to one object? Will they view the re&s;olves of October 9th, and the manner of wording them, after all that had pa&s;&s;ed, as a mere ac|cidental mode of expre&s;&s;ion, in men &s;o wi&s;e, &s;o much accu&s;tomed to weigh, and &s;o well acquainted with the import of words and the force of language, and as on|ly intended to re-iterate, and renew former appoint|ments, without any de&s;ign, in tho&s;e who framed the re|&s;olve, I will not &s;ay to throw du&s;t in the eyes of the Members of Congre&s;s, in general, but to draw them into a mea&s;ure, of which they might not con&s;ider its tendency, not only of effecting an alteration in one de|partment, but of making &s;uch an entire innovation upon another, as was not generally thought of, and would lead to the great changes that have &s;ince taken place?</P>
<P>Can it be &s;aid that neither the Secretary, who, though no Member of Congre&s;s, has an intere&s;t with many of them, without doors; nor any of the members them|&s;elves, were apprized of the difficulties that would, un|avoidably, ari&s;e from a re&s;olve of Congre&s;s, calculated to throw down the former &s;ettled di&s;tinctions, of July 17, 1775, and 1776, and Augu&s;t 20, la&s;t; in which my rank was &s;o clearly recognized and e&s;tabli&s;hed. One part of my
<PB N="XXX" REF="015447_0017_0F9981514DB892C0">
errand to Philadelphia, la&s;t June, was to confer with the Committee of Congre&s;s, on the nece&s;&s;ary e&s;tabli&s;hments for keeping up a clear and regular &s;ubordination in the General Ho&s;pital, through all its various departments, and this was the &s;ubject of &s;everal letters, to different Members. If any of the Members of Congre&s;s had di&s;|covered, in me, any want of abilities, for &s;o important a po&s;t; is it not rea&s;onable to imagine they would have openly, and avowedly, a&s;&s;igned it as a cau&s;e of di&s;quali|fication? But did they ever do it? Nay; what &s;ays the Secretary, him&s;elf, in his letter, of Augu&s;t 14, by way of making &s;ome acknowledgment for the mi&s;take he had committed, in his former, of Augu&s;t 2d. It is the te&s;timony, not of a friend, but an enemy, and one, whom I believe to be a deep agent in my removal. I will therefore quote his very words; for "<HI>fas e&s;t ab <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o&s;te doceri.</HI>"</P>
<P>"There is no man, Sir, acquainted with you, who can doubt of your abilities. All the world bears wit|ne&s;s of them, and the learned in Europe, who mu&s;t be allowed to be the be&s;t judges, have given ample te&s;ti|mony, by the honours they have heaped upon you. While you exerci&s;e your great talents, for the benefit of tho&s;e entru&s;ted to your care, your Country will honour you, and po&s;terity will do you ju&s;tice; even though Dr. S&mdash;, when you chance to meet, &s;hould refu&s;e to give you precedence."</P>
<P>I proceed to the relation of what happened, in con|&s;equence of tho&s;e re&s;olves of Congre&s;s, of October 9th, and the &s;trange behaviour of Dr. Shippen, the we&s;tern Director, thereupon.</P>
<P>Being at Hackin&s;ack, &s;oon after this "<HI>new arange|ment,</HI>" as he was plea&s;ed to &s;tile it, took place, I employ|ed my&s;elf, with all po&s;&s;ible indu&s;try, to put the ho&s;pital affairs in &s;uch a train, at Hackin&s;ack, that Dr. Warren might conduct them, without my pre&s;ence afterwards, that I might, without hinderance, be able to proceed to the White-Plains, to which place, General Wa&s;hington,
<PB N="XXXI" REF="015447_0017_0F9981514DB892C0">
and the army under him, had marched, a day or two be|fore; and the Briti&s;h troops were taking the &s;ame rout. I called, therefore, on General Green, at his camp, near Fort-Lee, to repre&s;ent to him the &s;ituation of the &s;ick, at Hackin&s;ack, and to reque&s;t his orders for procuring Dr. Warren &s;uch a&s;&s;i&s;tance, from the Quarter-Ma&s;ter-General's, and the Commi&s;&s;arial departments, as he re|quired. I met the we&s;tern Director there who, with a peculiar freedom, becoming the elevation to which he &s;eemed to con&s;ider him&s;elf as already rai&s;ed, or to be rai&s;ed, demanded why I was not at my po&s;t, on the other &s;ide the river? Accu&s;tomed to receive accounts from others, and to give orders my&s;elf, in the affairs of my department, I could not but feel the indignity of being thus taken to ta&s;k by him; and an&s;wered him ac|cordingly. I di&s;covered his de&s;ires and aims, but con|cluded he had more LEE-WAY yet to make, than to en|title him to avow his &s;entiments &s;o openly; but in this, it &s;eems, I was mi&s;taken.</P>
<P>The day following, Dr. Fo&s;ter, to who&s;e charge I had left the direction of the ho&s;pital, and care of the ho&s;pi|tal &s;tores, at Newark, came over, in ha&s;te, and de&s;ired a private conver&s;ation with me, on a &s;ubject of &s;ome deli|cacy. As I had vi&s;ited Newark, within a very few days, and every thing was reported to me to be in good order, and I had left all the directions I thought nece&s;&s;ary for future regulations, previous to my return to Head-Quarters, I could not conceive the occa&s;ion of this un|expected vi&s;it. But my foreboding mind took the alarm, of which I was yet ignorant of the cau&s;e, for he inform|ed me it was of &s;uch a nature, as made him think <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> im|proper to communicate, by letter.</P>
<P>After this preparation, he informed me, that the Di|rector had called on him, and propo&s;ed, but with great art and addre&s;s, the &s;urrendering up of the ho&s;pitals and &s;tores to his Direction; the care of the &s;ick to remain under the &s;ame per&s;ons whom I had &s;ent from my de|partment, but to act under his authority. He replied
<PB N="XXXII" REF="015447_0018_0F998151653884C8">
that he con&s;idered him&s;elf as under my direction only, in ho&s;pital matters; and that he did not think him&s;elf at liberty to deliver up the &s;tores to any per&s;on, without a written order from General Wa&s;hington, or the Di|rector-General. To this the Director made an&s;wer, that whatever like, or di&s;like, I might &s;hew to this pro|po&s;al, I &s;hould find my&s;elf obliged to acquie&s;ce in it.</P>
<P>The con&s;truction which the gentleman put upon this proceeding, was, that the appointment of the Director, being, to form and &s;uperintend the ho&s;pital of the flying camp, would terminate in a little time, as the troops, compo&s;ing the army, rai&s;ed for that &s;ervice, were en|li&s;ted but for a few months, unle&s;s he could carve out &s;ome place that he could be plea&s;ed with, in the mean while, that would put him on a better e&s;tabli&s;hment. I commended his prudence, in declining to deliver up the &s;tores, without proper orders, and de&s;ired, that, if any further demands, of the like kind, were made by Dr. Shippen, to refer him to me, for an an&s;wer.</P>
<P>The Director had expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to me, about a month before, in a manner that corre&s;ponded with the above idea. He told me, frankly, that he &s;hould like, well enough, to continue in the &s;ervice, as he thought it a more gentlemanny life, than that of a drudging private practitioner. I was truly de&s;irous of his continuance in that &s;tation, if he could remain in it, without elbow|ing me out of any thing that appertained to my place; for I did not then imagine he had yet a&s;pired to the place it&s;elf.</P>
<P>Having &s;erved in the army, the whole of la&s;t war, and had preten&s;ions, on that account, to &s;ome years ex|perience in military ho&s;pitals, which he knew nothing of; and having been appointed to the chief direction of the ho&s;pitals, the pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ceeding year, and having borne the burden of the day, ever &s;ince, it had not yet entered in|to my imagination, that I was &s;oon to give place to the very man, who, but four months before, not four months, nay, &s;carcely three, had written to announce
<PB N="XXXIII" REF="015447_0018_0F998151653884C8">
his appointment, as Director of the ho&s;pital of the fly|ing camp, and that he had enli&s;ted him&s;elf in the &s;er|vice of the American States, confe&s;&s;ed his being a mere novice in the management of his (&s;ubordinate) depart|ment, and applied to me for in&s;tructions in the <HI>etiquette,</HI> the word by which he cho&s;e to expre&s;s his notion, of the go|vernment of a General Ho&s;pital; and who promi&s;ed, from time to time to report to me the &s;tate of the ho&s;pitals under him, agreeable to an order of Congre&s;s for the purpo&s;e; but which, however, he never did. Perhaps he judged, from better information than I could ever obtain, that &s;o &s;oon as he had learned the "<HI>etiquette</HI>" of military ho&s;pitals, his elevation would render it un|nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>But what &s;urprized me, in his late conduct, was, that having an opportunity to acquaint me, the day before, in per&s;on, at General Green's, with his expectations and demands on the ho&s;pitals I had e&s;tabli&s;hed, he did not chu&s;e to &s;ay any thing to my&s;elf on the &s;ubject, but to apply to &s;ubordinate officers, to accompli&s;h his wi&s;hes, rather than treat with me as a principal; I thought this portended no good; but then I knew it was of a piece with very many other in&s;tances of his conduct, on dif|ferent occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>I went over, in a day or two after, to the White-Plains. A letter &s;oon arrived from the Director to General Wa&s;hington, complaining that his &s;ituation was unea&s;y, for he could not obtain the command of the &s;tores at Newark, and of cour&s;e of the ho&s;pitals I had e&s;tabli&s;hed there, and of the officers I had detached from my particular department, unle&s;s by the General's orders for the purpo&s;e, or by directions from me; for which, however, as I ob&s;erved before, he had never ap|plied.</P>
<P>The General was plea&s;ed to communicate this letter to me. I repre&s;ented to him the inconveniences of de|priving me of tho&s;e &s;tores, and that I had no others, in any &s;ufficient quantity, to an&s;wer the continual calls
<PB N="XXXIV" REF="015447_0019_0F9981523B6A1158">
upon me; that the re&s;t of the &s;tores, which, at his com|mand, were ordered to Stamford, (and from thence were removed by the Stamford Committee, without my knowledge, and with his approbation, as I afterwards learned) could be of no u&s;e to me, at that time; that the only medicines, which could be got at, were tho&s;e at Newark, which I had &s;natched as a brand out of the fire, at the retreat from New-York; and that I had appoint|ed an Apothecary on purpo&s;e to a&s;&s;ort and di&s;pen&s;e them out to Regimental Surgeons at Newark, as there was no po&s;&s;ibility of doing it in an army, con&s;tantly moving from place to place, under all the inconveniences we &s;uffered. To be borne down, with ince&s;&s;ant demands from all quarters, was hard indeed; and to be depriv|ed of the only re&s;ources I had left me, tho&s;e of my own providing, and of my own &s;aving, with extreme diffi|culty and hazard, to be at the &s;ole command of ano|ther, a junior, and inferior officer, appeared to me to be an unrea&s;onable demand. I had, already, detached near one half of the Surgeons and Mates, of the Ge|neral Ho&s;pital, to Newark and Hackin&s;ack, and by the General's command, e&s;tabli&s;hed ho&s;pitals there, at the very time I had pointed out the probable con&s;equences that would en&s;ue from the extraordinary re&s;olves of Congre&s;s, October 9th. There were, at this time, above fifteen hundred &s;ick, at tho&s;e two places, under the care of my own Surgeons. I had ju&s;t received let|ters from them, which &s;hewed they were gradually working through all their fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">mer difficulties, by &s;teadi|ly pur&s;uing the directions I had left them: With the&s;e advantages and their own experience they were more likely to compleat the work, than they would be, if in the mid&s;t of it they were to receive new directions from one, who, with all due deference to his abilities was le&s;s acquainted, than them&s;elves, with the arrange|ments of a General Ho&s;pital I ob&s;erved, that to deli|ver up the ho&s;pitals <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, would be to &s;trip me of all power of being u&s;eful; and it was not

in the power of the director to &s;upply their places, if the &s;tores, ho&s;pitals and &s;ick, were to be committed to his care, and my proper officers were to return under my command, on the ea&s;t &s;ide of the River; whence the-&s;ick mu&s;t &s;uffer; and if the &s;tores were delivered up, we our&s;elves mu&s;t become de&s;titute and helple&s;s, and yet expo&s;ed to greater clamours than ever. I had, in no in&s;tance, interfered with the Director of the Fly|ing Camp, but offered to give him every a&s;&s;i&s;tance in my power, that he was plea&s;ed to call for. But to be &s;tripped of the rank of a Director-General, and the power of my &s;tation, and to be left but the &s;hadow of a Direc|tor, and yet to be accountable for every accident, or mi&s;conduct of others, as well as of my own department, and, from the highe&s;t po&s;t, to be rendered the mere depen|dent of a junior and &s;ubordinate officer, was what I ne|ver would &s;ubmit to. Sooner than be &s;ubject to &s;uch controul, or give up the &s;tores and ho&s;pitals, which by the General's orders I had e&s;tabli&s;hed for the &s;ick of his own army, when I had no convenience for providing others, I would give up my commi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The General promi&s;ed he would, and I doubt not but he did write to the Director, in an&s;wer to his let|ter, "That the ho&s;pitals I had e&s;tabli&s;hed, and the &s;urgeons and &s;tores I had &s;ent to Newark and Hackin|&s;ack, were to remain under my direction."</P>
<P>What was my &s;urprize to hear, after &s;ome time, from &s;ome of the officers of the ho&s;pital that were under me, in the Jer&s;eys, [for it &s;eemed proper that I &s;hould ne|ver know, but in a circuitous manner, what mo&s;t im|mediately regarded my&s;elf,] that tho&s;e &s;tores which had been provided for General Wa&s;hington's army, and which I had &s;aved at New-York, and &s;ent to the Jer&s;eys for &s;afety, and for the convenience of i&s;&s;uing out to the ho&s;pital &s;ick under my own care, and to the Regi|mental Surgeons, were now actually ordered, by a late vote of Congre&s;s, to be delivered up to the Director of the Flying-Camp; and that he received letters, at

appeared on the point of being &s;wallowed up for ever, if &s;ome vigorous mea&s;ures were not immediately pur&s;ued to apply an effectual remedy; and I had ven|tured, without waiting for orders, to fly to the place of danger, where I thought my pre&s;ence mo&s;t wanted, I had no doubts that I &s;hould no &s;ooner have mentioned my apprehended grievance, than I &s;hould have had im|mediate redre&s;s. Fully per&s;uaded that my &s;ervices and &s;acrifices merited con&s;ideration, and entirely ignorant that malice had yet attempted to di&s;colour the merit of my proceedings, I did not &s;u&s;pect that any crime had been laid to my charge, till I complained of the injury done me. So &s;hort &s;ighted are mortals, and &s;o true it is that a man is never expo&s;ed to greater hazards than when he lea&s;t apprehends them. Now, for the fir&s;t time, I heard of the clamours about the &s;ufferings of the &s;ick in the Jer&s;ies, and at Philadelphia; and although I had been re&s;tricted to the ea&s;t &s;ide of Hud&s;on's-River, to make way for one of ri&s;ing intere&s;t, the misfortunes of the department committed to his care, were wholly a&s;cribed to me, notwith&s;tanding the direction was taken out of my hands, for his &s;ake.</P>
<P>I applied for admi&s;&s;ion to Congre&s;s; Mr. Samuel Adams appeared. On mentioning the cau&s;e of my ap|plication, he gave me to under&s;tand that complaints were brought again&s;t me, and the &s;ufferings of the &s;ick charged to me, with circum&s;tances greatly reflecting on my humanity. I denied the ju&s;tice of the charge, and being at the door of the chamber where the Congre&s;s were &s;etting, I thus addre&s;&s;ed him: Sir, I do &s;olemnly deny the charge, and do intreat I may, this in&s;tant, be introduced to Con|gre&s;s, that I may have an opportunity of vindicating my|&s;elf again&s;t every injurious a&s;per&s;ion. Of this, Sir, I am confident, the more my conduct, in the &s;tation of Di|rector-General, is examined into the more lu&s;tre will it reflect upon me. I a&s;k <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> an inquiry. I de&s;ire to know the particulars of the charge and who are my accu&s;ers, to meet them face to face, and am willing to &s;tand the te&s;t of the &s;tricte&s;t &s;crutiny.</P>
<P><PB N="XI" REF="015447_0022_0F9981546776A558">
I was refu&s;ed admi&s;&s;ion, it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;aid the Congre&s;s was engaged in &s;ome important matter. I again de&s;ired the gentleman to inform me what particulars were laid to my charge? I could neither learn them, nor who were my accu&s;ers. As I could not obtain an audience, at that time, I begged Mr. Adams to inform Congre&s;s of the de&s;ign of my coming, and my de&s;ire of admi&s;&s;ion, and I let him know that I waited at my lodgings, in ex|pectation of an hearing, when Congre&s;s had lie&s;ure to grant it. I obtained it not. Congre&s;s adjourned to Maryland, without taking the lea&s;t notice of my appeal to them. I repeated my application, through the &s;ame gentleman, by letter. My di&s;mi&s;&s;ion took place without an hearing, and without any an&s;wer, and without &s;u&s;pending me from office, till they could be &s;atisfied of the facts alledged again&s;t me; for this, it &s;eems would be too great a conde&s;cen&s;ion.</P>
<P>I would fain a&s;k, whether &s;uch a denial of my humble reque&s;t, and keeping me in ignorance of my reputed crimes, and &s;ecret accu&s;ers, is agreeable to humanity, or what is u&s;ually allowed to the greate&s;t criminals? Is it a way to beget a reliance on the &s;afety and honour of the Hou&s;e, that after having pa&s;&s;ed judgment, without an hearing, I may &s;till depend on ample ju&s;tice, candour and genero&s;ity of treatment? Is &s;uch a proceeding u&s;|ual? Might I not have rather expected to have been fir&s;t &s;u&s;pended, then tried, and judgment to follow, and not precede conviction, on any breach of order or mi&s;con|duct?</P>
<P>Had I been con&s;cious of guilt, may it not be pre&s;umed I &s;hould have &s;ought to &s;helter my&s;elf, by a re&s;ignation, rather than in&s;i&s;t on a trial? Could a better pretext have been afforded? The Congre&s;s, contrary to every known rule, by a re&s;olve of theirs, had reduced me from the rank of Director-General, removed me from my right, of attending the army under the Commander in Chief, to give place to a temporary Director, who, before, was made accountable to me, as head of the department;
<PB N="XLI" REF="015447_0022_0F9981546776A558">
clamours were rai&s;ed again&s;t me, (groundle&s;s indeed!) I a&s;ked for an hearing, and was refu&s;ed. Re&s;ignation was intimated to me, as what alone would quiet tho&s;e clamours. What temptation was there for a per&s;on con&s;cious of guilt, to wi&s;h a continuance in office, till his conduct could be examined into? On the contrary, every thing was to be apprehended under that circum|&s;tance. The mo&s;t imminent danger that the cau&s;e it&s;elf was lo&s;t filled the minds of many. I &s;aw the black clouds gathering on the margin of the political horri&s;on, threatening, on every &s;ide, to over-whelm its abettors in a general de&s;truction, on one hand; and my&s;elf in private ruin, on the other; unle&s;s I could make my re|treat from the approaching tempe&s;t. Did I, coward-like, ba&s;ely fly; nay, the very appearance of danger de|termined me to face the &s;torm, and prove the fal&s;ity of the charges again&s;t me. I met two of the Georgia De|legates. I acquainted them with what had happened; that I would &s;tand by the cau&s;e, during the pre&s;ent dan|gerous on&s;et; but when that was over, I would in&s;i&s;t on an immediate hearing, and, if not granted, then re&s;ign.</P>
<P>I repaired to the &s;cene of danger, but was ordered to the ea&s;t &s;ide of Hud&s;on's-River. Submi&s;&s;ion was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> duty, for the pre&s;ent moment; redre&s;s my hope and expectation, &s;o &s;oon as Congre&s;s had lie&s;ure, and was in a &s;ituation to attend to it. I pur&s;ued my bu&s;ine&s;s, as though I had received no cau&s;e of complaint, till I could obtain an hearing. But in&s;tead of redre&s;s, the fir&s;t ac|count I received, but through an indirect channel, was that of my di&s;mi&s;&s;ion. I had prepared, in ha&s;te, a nar|rative of my proceedings, in the department committed to me. I immediately &s;ent it to the General, with a de|&s;ire of its being laid before Congre&s;s, for their recon&s;i|deration of what was done, as I thought with precipi|tancy, and did not doubt that, on better information, they would quickly retract from the mea&s;ure, or, at lea&s;t, give me an audience, and judge on the evidence of facts, compared with their own re&s;olves and the General's or|ders.</P>
<P><PB N="XLII" REF="015447_0023_0F9981557B71F0F8">
At any rate, if they were determined to deliver me up to the cries of a faction, I thought Congre&s;s, for its own &s;ake, would have let me down gently. If the &s;a|crifice mu&s;t be made to gratify it, I thought Congre&s;s would &s;uppo&s;e that &s;omething was due to the character I had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> in life, to the rank I had held in my pro|fe&s;&s;ion, to the general reputation which public honours from the learned &s;ocieties in Europe are &s;uppo&s;ed to con|fer.

And could not all the&s;e procure &s;ome &s;hadow of lenity, where a victim was to be offered up; &s;omething like compa&s;&s;ion; &s;ome an&s;wer to my humble memorial, in my vindication, and my petition only "<HI>to be heard</HI>"? I mu&s;t &s;ay none. Three months are nearly elap&s;ed, whil&s;t I have not re|ceived one line or me&s;&s;age in an&s;wer. In the mean while, as if that refu&s;al was the &s;ignal; the alarm &s;pread; news-papers bear witne&s;s to my degradation.

But why &s;hould I pretend to enumerate the evil con&s;equences of &s;uch a &s;everity of conduct to|wards me?

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHEN I was called by the choice of my country, to the &s;tation of Director-General of the ho&s;pital and Phy&s;ician in chief, I left a re&s;pectable and lucrative practice again&s;t the judgment of &s;ome con&s;iderable per&s;ons in my native city, who, from regard to me, and what they conceived to be my intere&s;t, endeavoured in vain to di&s;|&s;uade me from accepting the po&s;t, truly honourable as they allowed it to be. Their advice had no influence over me. Without he&s;itation, I &s;acrificed it, with every future pro&s;pect of better expectations from continuing with them to the &s;atisfaction of &s;erving my country, AT THE HEAD OF THE HOSPITAL, IN THE ARMY, UN|DER YOUR EXCELLENCY'S IMMEDIATE COMMAND.</P>
<P>Having had &s;ome experience, in times pa&s;t, of the nature of the department, I have, ever &s;ince I took charge of it, made it my con&s;tant &s;tudy, to make my&s;elf ma&s;ter of the &s;ubject, and to acquire a thorough in&s;ight into it. With what &s;ucce&s;s, I do not think can be judged off, from the out&s;ide appearances of la&s;t campaign, and the cau&s;es which prevented the &s;everal regulations I propo&s;ed, from taking place agreeable to my wi&s;hes. It would be te|dious to enumerate them all; yet it cannot be ami&s;s to point at &s;ome of the principal.<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">See the Appendix.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="015447_0025_0F998156A9B19580">
The fir&s;t of the&s;e which I &s;hall mention was, the want of &s;ufficient time and opportunity before the opening of the campaign, to have all the regimental Surgeons properly furni&s;hed by Congre&s;s, and made acquainted with their duty, of which many of them were very ig|norant, and the <HI>error</HI> of having them look to the Gene|ral ho&s;pital for tho&s;e &s;upplies of medicines and in&s;tru|ments, &amp;c. which it would have been better to have &s;ent to them by Continental Druggi&s;ts, who might have the means of collecting and preparing every article in a &s;ui|table manner, which it is vain to attempt in a moving army. Another cau&s;e was the want of a &s;ufficient num|ber of certain ho&s;pital officers and a&s;&s;i&s;tants, and the means of procuring them when allowed by Congre&s;s, which was late, as Commi&s;&s;aries, Storekeepers, Stewards, Ward-Ma&s;ters, &amp;c. (<HI>b</HI>) This difficulty was increa&s;ed from the nature of the campaign, in which, contrary to expec|tation, it became nece&s;&s;ary, to &s;hift the places of the Ge|neral ho&s;pital frequently, and to branch it out in &s;uch a number of ho&s;pitals widely di&s;tant from each other. (<HI>c</HI>) To the&s;e may be added, fir&s;t, the want of &s;ufficient help from other departments, which it was impo&s;&s;ible to re|medy in the &s;tate our army then was. (<HI>d</HI>)</P>
<P>2dly, The neglect of the regimental Surgeons, to re|port the &s;ick of their regiments in &s;ea&s;on, and in an or|derly manner to the General ho&s;pital, though often re|quired in General orders, Re&s;olves of Congre&s;s and otherwi&s;e, to do it; (<HI>e</HI>) and &s;ometimes keeping back their &s;ick from entering into it at all, or till they became very numerous; then di&s;charging them all at once into the Ge|neral ho&s;pital, at the time of an engagement with the ene|my, and when the attention of the whole body of ho&s;pi|tal Surgeons was nece&s;&s;ary to take care of the wounded. And la&s;tly, the frequent and long ab&s;ence of the regi|mental Surgeons from their regiments, who, in&s;tead of &s;ending the &s;ick, as they ought to have done, to the Ge|neral ho&s;pital, had them conveyed to &s;ome remote regimen|tal ho&s;pitals, where they neither had, nor could obtain &s;ui|table nece&s;&s;aries for their provi&s;ion and care (<HI>f</HI>)</P>

On my fir&s;t arrival at Cambridge, I &s;et about to e&s;tabli&s;h rules for the General ho&s;pital Surgeons. I had heard of many abu&s;es being practi&s;ed by enormous drafts of expen&s;ive &s;tores from the General ho&s;pital, to which, with your Excellency's approbation, to whom I made re|port thereof, I put a &s;top and limited the demands of regimental Surgeons to &s;uch articles, as Indian meal, oat|meal, rice, barley, mola&s;&s;es, and the like, and required that &s;uch &s;ick as wanted others, &s;hould be &s;ent to the General ho&s;pital, that the&s;e things might be di&s;pen&s;ed out under my own direction. (<HI>g</HI>)</P>
<P>The next reformation I attempted was to call upon all the Mates in the ho&s;pital to undergo an examination of their abilities, in order to &s;elect from the number tho&s;e who were be&s;t qualified for the &s;ervice.&mdash;This was fol|lowed by your Excellency's orders, to &s;ee that all the re|gimental Surgeons and Mates &s;hould pa&s;s a like exami|nation. I began the ta&s;k, but the movements of the ar|my, the aver&s;ion of Surgeons to undergo the&s;e examina|tions, from which too they were often &s;creened by their Colonels, and by pretence of &s;ickne&s;s, &amp;c. and the in|crea&s;ing bu&s;ine&s;s on hand prevented my proceeding far in it.

<P>When the army lay before Bo&s;ton, the &s;mall-pox fre|quently made it's appearance in it, owing to the number of per&s;ons who came out of that city with the infection upon them, which endangered the &s;preading of the con|tagion among&s;t our troops. By the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the &s;mall-pox ho&s;pital in a &s;uitable place, with proper per&s;ons to take care of the &s;ick, and the precaution of &s;ending all infected per&s;ons to it, &s;o &s;oon as known to have the di&s;|ea&s;e, and to cut off all communication betwixt it and the troops, the army was pre&s;erved from ever receiving any injury from it.</P>
<P>When the troops marched from Cambridge for New-York, all the &s;ick were left behind in the General ho&s;pi|tal, amounting to upwards of three hundred men. In le&s;s than &s;ix weeks, during which time but few died, I
<PB N="4" REF="015447_0026_0F998157692C5FF0">
was able to di&s;charge the ho&s;pital of every man, to &s;ettle and pay every account, in&s;omuch as never to have had any further demands from that quarter.</P>
<P>During this time, with little or no expence to the pub|lic but for package and tran&s;portation I collected medi|cines, furniture and ho&s;pital &s;tores, worth many thou&s;and pounds, and &s;ent them on to New-York. The like quan|tity, I apprehend, could not be procured in any part of America. Nor were the&s;e obtained for the u&s;e of the army, without much trouble and a&s;&s;iduity, owing to a &s;trong oppo&s;ition that was made to prevent it. (<HI>k</HI>)&mdash;Be&s;ides the&s;e, I was able, by means of the &s;ubaltern officers in the ho&s;pital, &s;ome of whom I employed continually at the work, likewi&s;e to collect to the amount of near two thou&s;and rugs and blankets, near as many bed&s;acks and pillows which were taken up from docks, and were ga|thered from ho&s;pitals and barracks, &amp;c. The&s;e being wa&s;hed and aired &s;erved the la&s;t campaign when none others could be got, and many of them are yet in good pre&s;ervation.&mdash;At New-York I collected &s;ome hundred &s;heets, fracture boxes, and other u&s;eful articles.</P>
<P>It may be thought perhaps that I place a higher value upon the&s;e acqui&s;itions than they merit; be that as it may, I am per&s;uaded the like could not be obtained now for much le&s;s than thirty thou&s;and dollars, which is equal to the whole amount of what I have ever drawn or ex|pended for the General ho&s;pital, in the &s;pace of a twelve|month, including the pay of all the officers and all the ho&s;pital expences of every kind, which have fallen with|in my department to &s;ettle, and for the faithful expendi|ture of the &s;ame, I am ready to produce my accounts, receipts and vouchers, whenever called upon for a &s;ettle|ment. Yet the General ho&s;pital has had the con&s;tant charge of a number from two or three hundred to a thou&s;and &s;ick and upwards to provide for and attend. Nor have any articles of the public &s;tores been embezzled or mis-applied, nor the &s;ick &s;uffered in the General ho&s;pital for want of any thing I thought them entitled to draw from the ho&s;pital, and that I could procure for them.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="015447_0026_0F998157692C5FF0">
The medicines and &s;tores provided, as above mentioned, have been appropriated with equal faithfulne&s;s and &s;trict oeconomy to the u&s;e of the General ho&s;pital; or i&s;&s;ued from thence to regimental Surgeons, or remain on hand, &s;ubject to your Excellency's order. I have never bur|dened the Quarter-Ma&s;ter-General's department with any unnece&s;&s;ary demand from thence. And as to the Commi&s;&s;ary-General, he will do me ju&s;tice, as he has often declared him&s;elf on that head, that my drafts were within the mo&s;t rea&s;onable bounds. I am per&s;uaded that of the &s;ick who have been drawn for in the General ho&s;|pital, if none of them have been drawn for at the &s;ame time with the well men in their regiments, the &s;toppage of their rations will go a great way towards paying the whole of the expences the ho&s;pital has been put to, on their account, for provi&s;ion and &s;tores of whatever kind. (<HI>l</HI>)</P>
<P>In a conference I once had with your Excellency at Cambridge, on the &s;ubject of ho&s;pital expences, you told me, and I took it as a hint of caution and advice to ob|&s;erve the &s;tricte&s;t oeconomy in my department (from which I have never deviated) that you were fearful the expences of the General ho&s;pital would exceed the e&s;ti|mate that had been made of them, by a per&s;on of ex|perience in General ho&s;pital matters. If I rightly recol|lect, your Excellency thought the &s;um mentioned to be ten thou&s;and pounds &s;terling per annum. I was &s;ur|prized, and concluded the gentleman was mi&s;taken; I re&s;olved however, if po&s;&s;ible, to employ &s;uch &s;trict oecon|omy in the department, as to keep within tho&s;e bounds, yet was fearful it could not be accompli&s;hed, on account of the advanced price of every article of living and ho&s;pi|tal &s;tores. De&s;irous of knowing what were the princi|ples on which he founded the calculation, I wrote to the per&s;on that was mentioned, on the &s;ubject, in an&s;wer to which he informed me, that the e&s;timate, he had given in to General Gates was ten thou&s;and pounds &s;terling, for every ten thou&s;and men, for &s;ix months, and &s;o in proportion, which is equal to 40 000 &pound;. &s;ter. per. annum, for 20,000 men, the number then kept on foot.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="015447_0027_0F99815825D057F8">
At the &s;ame time, as one qualified to give me full in|formation, I wrote to him with a view to clear up all doubts, or to confirm my &s;entiments in regard to the manner in which the regimental Surgeons were &s;upplied in the Briti&s;h &s;ervice, with medicines and in&s;truments, and to know what right they had to draw &s;tores from the General ho&s;pital; to which his an&s;wer corre&s;ponded with the opinion I had ever entertained of the nature of the &s;ervice. 'Till Congre&s;s, or your Excellency &s;hould give orders for a different mode to be pur&s;ued, I con&s;idered my&s;elf to be bound in duty to keep the Briti&s;h e&s;tabli&s;h|ment con&s;tantly in my eye, as a directory, making allow|ance for the nature and difference of the &s;ervice. (<HI>m</HI>)</P>
<P>Moreover, I was afterwards favored with your Excel|lency's opinion on the &s;ubject, contained in tho&s;e ob&s;er|vations you was plea&s;ed to be&s;tow on the plan of regula|tions, which, by your command I &s;ketched out, for get|ting again into a proper train, after we had, by one acci|dent or another, been forced from the original plan of a General ho&s;pital, and got into confu&s;ion, on account of the oppo&s;ition, &s;ome of the re&s;olves of Congre&s;s, of July 17 la&s;t, met with from many of the regimental Surgeons, and the impracticability of complying with others of them, in the &s;ituation we were then placed. Your words were, "What is the practi&s;e in this ca&s;e in the Briti&s;h army? Why &s;hould we think of improving upon their &s;y&s;tem, founded on long experience?"</P>
<P>Upon fir&s;t entering upon the duties of my &s;tation, ap|prehending that the General ho&s;pital was not amply &s;up|plied, as I could wi&s;h, with bandages, old linnen and other implements of &s;urgery, that would be required, in ca&s;e of an action, I &s;et my&s;elf to &s;upply tho&s;e wants im|mediately, which I effected with little expence of money, but with great labor, in which I had all po&s;&s;ible a&s;&s;i&s;tance from the ho&s;pital Surgeons and Mates. I collected large quantities of old linnen, lint and &s;heets, made up &s;ix thou|&s;and bandages, and &s;ix hundred tourniquets, for the u&s;e of the General ho&s;pital, &amp;c. which, though &s;ufficient for

a pre&s;ent ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">igency, I did not think more than might be wanted for &s;ix ho&s;pitals, which I managed at that time.</P>
<P>Being then de&s;irous of knowing how the regimental Surgeons were &s;upplied, I propo&s;ed the calling upon them in general orders, for that purpo&s;e, and with a view to learn whether their a&s;&s;i&s;tance could be depended upon in the field, and whether they were properly fur|ni&s;hed with medicines. Except Mr. Magaw, Surgeon of Col. Thom&s;on's regiment, and a few others, they had &s;carcely the &s;hadow of a &s;upply&mdash;I gave in a report there|of, with a weekly return of the &s;ick; I al&s;o &s;tated to your Excellency what I conceived to be my duty, and that it was limited to the care of the &s;ick in the General ho&s;pi|tal.</P>
<P>This inquiry into the wants of regimental Sur|geons, made them turn, as it were, on the General ho&s;|pital. They wi&s;hed to furni&s;h them&s;elves from it, with tho&s;e articles of dre&s;&s;ings, which the ho&s;pital Surgeons had collected, and made up for them&s;elves, which tho&s;e gentlemen thought an unrea&s;onable demand. Farther, the regimental Surgeons wanted, contrary to all u&s;age, to draw from the General ho&s;pital, all they &s;hould call for, in the way of &s;tores, whether diaetetic or medicinal, for the u&s;e of the &s;ick retained under their care, in re|gimental ho&s;pitals, and to be provided by me with in|&s;truments and bandages, or to fix the odium of their in|&s;ufficiency at my door. I therefore recommended in my report the nece&s;&s;ity of providing (not in the army or General ho&s;pital) but from Continental Druggi&s;ts (for that was what I intended) "a capital &s;et of medicines, in&s;truments, &amp;c. as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, and advi&s;ed that portable che&s;ts &s;hould be furni&s;hed from every regiment for a whole year, at once, and each che&s;t be provided with in&s;truments and bandages."&mdash;I did not expect, weak handed as I was, with re&s;pect to officers and a&s;&s;i&s;tants in the General ho&s;pital, from its very e&s;tabli&s;hment by Congre&s;s, that this ta&s;k would be enjoined on me, I thought my duty pointed out by that e&s;tabli&s;hment, as much as I
<PB N="8" REF="015447_0028_0F998159C3B76E68">
could well execute, and which only related to the Gene|ral ho&s;pital it&s;elf; although with an earne&s;t de&s;ire of pro|moting the good of the &s;ervice, I early pointed out the wants of the regiment Surgeons, and in time for hav|ing the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;upplied with nece&s;&s;aries after the manner that has always been practi&s;ed in the Briti&s;h army, I wrote to inform your Excellency, "that my commi&s;&s;ion only ex|tended to the care of the General Ho&s;pital; the plan of e&s;tabli&s;hment by Congre&s;s, of July 28, 1775. The li&s;t, number and arrangement of officers, and my in&s;tructions from Congre&s;s, which were wholly &s;ilent concerning re|giments, their Surgeons or &s;upplies confirmed this opin|ion," not to &s;ay any thing of the low e&s;timate, which I had under&s;tood was formed for the &s;upport of the Ge|neral ho&s;pital.</P>
<P>I then gave it as my opinion, grounded on the cu&s;tom of the Briti&s;h army, of &s;upplying the medicine che&s;ts by &s;toppages, "that if the &s;ick, remaining in regiments, were to be &s;upplied at a public expence (and not by &s;top|pages) that expence ought to be made a regimental charge, and might be delivered in with an ab&s;tract of the regiment, (or any other better way,) that the General ho&s;|pital, having nothing to do with the affair from its very nature, ought not to be burdened with their &s;upplies; for then, on the number of &s;ick admitted in the General ho&s;pital being known, the expence nece&s;&s;ary for their &s;upport could, after a while, be better e&s;timated from experience."</P>
<P>I then called on your Excellency, in the &s;ame letter, "for in&s;tructions what to do?' I informed you "that the nature and de&s;ign of the General ho&s;pital, being little under&s;tood, and the nature of my duty &s;o much mi&s;|taken, both by the regimental Surgeons and officers, and many things expected from me, impo&s;&s;ible to be complied with, I apprehended it to be ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary that certain regulations &s;hould be fixed upon, to a&s;certain my duty, and tho&s;e of the Surgeons and officers under me, as well as tho&s;e of the regimental Surgeons, which all
<PB N="9" REF="015447_0028_0F998159C3B76E68">
ought to know, and not ho&s;pital and regimental Surgeons only, but in general, every officer of any rank in the ar|my, to prevent interference and mi&s;takes."&mdash;</P>
<P>Be&s;ides giving this information, in order to bring about a farther explanation of the matter, and with a view to accompli&s;h the end propo&s;ed by it; when I came to New-York, I laid a plan before the regimental Surgeons, to a&s;certain their duty, with a draft for a memorial to be laid by them before Congre&s;s &s;tating their pre&s;ent diffi|culties, of which they approved; and I wrote pre&s;&s;ingly my&s;elf on the &s;ubject, to the Doctors Committee of Con|gre&s;s; and at various other times I have delivered my opinion on the duties of regimental Surgeons, which may be &s;een in the general orders, particularly of July 3d, and July 28th, 1776. But although the &s;entiments con|tained in tho&s;e orders were enjoined by your Excellency to be made the rule of conduct, and I think they were well calculated to an&s;wer the purpo&s;e, yet they were little regarded <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">y many of the regimental Surgeons, and openly oppo&s;ed by others. (<HI>n</HI>)</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the manner in which I came to have the charge of &s;upplying all the regimental Surgeons with medicine che&s;ts, &amp;c. contrary to what I had always conceived to be the proper method, or u&s;ual for a Gene|ral ho&s;pital, as I had always declared, I beg leave to re|mark, that the &s;urrender of Bo&s;ton having put us in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a large, though una&s;&s;orted &s;tock of medi|cines, ho&s;pital furniture, &amp;c. your Excellency was plea&s;|ed to order me, by the Quarter-Ma&s;ter-General, to put up medicine che&s;ts for five regiments, at Bo&s;ton, Salem and Marblehead, &amp;c. about the time the re&s;t of the army moved to New-York. This I cannot but look upon as the beginning of all my &s;ub&s;equent difficulties. When I arrived afterwards at New-York, your Excellency was at Philadelphia, and I was repeatedly called upon by letters, and in the way of per&s;onal applications from regimental Surgeons and officers, to furni&s;h &s;everal regiments that were at New-York, and others gone to Canada, with
<PB N="10" REF="015447_0029_0F99815A6542AA70">
medicine che&s;ts. My hope and expectation had been, that out of the whole &s;tock I had collected, I might be permitted to take &s;uch as were wanted for the General ho&s;pital, and then to deliver the remainder to any Com|mi&s;&s;ary or Continental Druggi&s;t, appointed by Congre&s;s, or by your Excellency, to receive it, for the u&s;e of the public, and particularly for furni&s;hing regimental Sur|geons. I received &s;everal intimations at this time, from different per&s;ons, that Congre&s;s expected from me to &s;upply the northern army with medicines and ho&s;pital &s;tores.</P>
<P>Having received no orders, however, for that purpo&s;e and the campaign then opening, I thought it highly ex|pedient to receive clear in&s;tructions on that head, and applied for leave to go to Philadelphia, to have a confe|rence with &s;ome members of Congre&s;s to know what I had to depend upon. Your Excellency gave me leave of ab&s;ence for ten days, and although it proved too &s;hort a time to &s;ettle the bu&s;ine&s;s of my department, yet I return|ed punctually on the day appointed.</P>
<P>Before my arrival at Philadelphia, I learned that the Congre&s;s had purcha&s;ed a valuable &s;tock of medicines, which were in the hands of &s;ome druggi&s;ts in town, out of which (on a &s;uppo&s;ition I imagine that they had more than would be wanted for public u&s;e) &s;uch con&s;iderable &s;ales had been made by permi&s;&s;ion of Congre&s;s, and large quan|tities &s;ent to the Southward, that it appeared to me there was danger, from the great reduction that was made in it already, le&s;t the be&s;t collection of medicines I had ever &s;een in America for an army, might &s;lip out of the power of Congre&s;s from &s;uch &s;ale, &amp;c. which might prove a lo&s;s they might not have it in their power to retrieve in the whole year. (<HI>o</HI>) I therefore pre&s;umed to caution the committee again&s;t it. Upon conferring with them on the &s;ubject, as I had, though contrary to u&s;age, been obliged to put up medicine che&s;ts for &s;ome regiments, I under|took, if I might be allowed &s;uch a &s;hare of what was on hand as might be wanting from time to time to a&s;&s;ort

tho&s;e in my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, to u&s;e my be&s;t endeavours to &s;up|ply regimental che&s;ts to the regiments at New-York un|der your Excellency's command, for one campaign by way of trial; for I did not want to &s;hrink from any <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, a&s;&s;igned me, whether my proper duty or not, by which I might &s;erve my country, as far as it was practicable for me to do it.</P>
<P>I did not conceive from all I was able to learn that there would be more than forty or fifty regiments a&s;&s;em|bled at New-York; nor did I &s;uppo&s;e that one half of tho&s;e would come de&s;titute of medicines and chirurgical apparatus, when I heard that the Southward regiments were &s;upplied by the Continental Druggi&s;ts; and I had taken pains at Cambridge, occa&s;ionally, to acquaint Gene|ral officers, Commanders of regiments and regimental Surgeons, with my idea that they were not to look to the General ho&s;pital for tho&s;e &s;upplies, but have their regi|ments furni&s;hed, where rai&s;ed, as being the mo&s;t ea&s;y and natural method; nor did I expect &s;uch numerous de|tachments of militia, all of which came unprovided, and looked to me for &s;upplies of every thing they wanted, not chu&s;ing to &s;end their &s;ick to be under the care of the Surgeons of the ho&s;pital.</P>
<P>I &s;upplied from 40 to 50 regiments with medicine che&s;ts by the end of Augu&s;t, be&s;ides all the branches of the General ho&s;pital at New-York, in the bowry and neighbourhood, and at Long-I&s;land, which reduced many of our capital articles to an in&s;ufficiency for the General ho&s;pital for the remaining part of the campaign. And the&s;e I was obliged to collect el&s;ewhere as well as I could; for although there was a great &s;how of medicines and furniture left, yet many of the principal medicines being exhau&s;ted, and other ar|ticles not being duly prepared, nor &s;uch as were u&s;ually called for or wanted for regimental u&s;e, that &s;how availed but little. To give what were at hand and could be &s;pared from ho&s;pital u&s;e, which the regimental Surgeons would neither accept of nor be an&s;werable for, would be, as &s;cripture expre&s;&s;es it, to give one that a&s;ked for bread, a &s;tone; or for an egg, a &s;erpent.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="015447_0030_0F99815D91CBDCC8">
It was by your Excellency's command that I &s;hipped off part of the &s;tores, as I did, to Stamford, to prevent the whole being lo&s;t, in ca&s;e the enemy &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s them&s;elves of New York From thence they were &s;ent into the country, as &s;ome frigates had got into the Sound, and it was ea&s;y to land near Stamford, whereby the &s;tores might be de&s;troyed.

The mo&s;t valuable part, however, was &s;till left in New-York, when the enemy had effected a landing, drawn a line acro&s;s the i&s;land, and were &s;uppo&s;ed to be then entering New-York.

<P>At this critical juncture, I went over with &s;ome of the ho&s;pital officers, and brought off all that had been left, in a pettiauger, which was filled therewith.

Some of our Mates fell into the hands of the enemy, and many of the Nur&s;es and Waiters fled, and the militia ran off and impre&s;&s;ed every waggon they could find in the neighbourhood. It therefore required &s;ome days to get on all the &s;ick and wounded, through many difficulties, from the fright of the inhabitants and their reluctance to admit of the ho&s;pitals being &s;tationed at that place.
<PB N="13" REF="015447_0030_0F99815D91CBDCC8">
I had provi&s;ions to collect, a Commi&s;&s;ary and Ward-Ma&s;ter to &s;eek, and Nur&s;es and Waiters to procure, with every thing nece&s;&s;ary for the comfortable accommoda|tion of the &s;ick and wounded.

<P>After this, judge, Sir, of my di&s;tre&s;s, to find how much this affair had been mi&s;repre&s;ented to your Excellency, as I perceived it was by a letter ju&s;t written to me by your Aid-de-Camp, &s;etting forth the mi&s;erable &s;ituation to which the &s;ick were reduced, and the clamour for want of medicines, ab&s;olutely in&s;i&s;ting on an immediate and &s;ufficient &s;upply, for "whil&s;t I was re&s;erving the medi|cines for ca&s;es of emergency, the &s;ick were dying in num|bers for want of a nece&s;&s;ary &s;upply." I had ju&s;t &s;ent to an eminent private Drugge&s;t, as well as to Mr. <HI>William Smith,</HI> the Continental Druggi&s;t, at Philadelphia, pray|ing for a &s;upply of &s;uch articles as either I had not or could not be got at, enclo&s;ing each of them a li&s;t for the purpo&s;e.

<P>What made it more a&s;toni&s;hing that the number and clamors of the &s;ick &s;hould be &s;o great at that time is, that in a con&s;ultation which your Excellency, General <HI>Green</HI> and General <HI>Par&s;ons</HI> had, a few days before the evacua|tion of New-York it was there propo&s;ed to &s;end off the &s;ick and all unfit for duty in brigades, with &s;ome careful officers out of each brigade to attend them, and money to defray the expences of &s;uitable accommodations and refre&s;hments; and a Surgeon was ordered a long with the &s;ick of each brigade, that they might not &s;uffer for want of medical a&s;&s;i&s;tance.(<HI>w</HI>) I am &s;till of opinion, it was the be&s;t &s;tep that could have been taken to prevent the &s;ick from falling into the enemy's hands, unle&s;s what I once mentioned to your Excellency as my wi&s;h could have been accompli&s;hed, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> That protections might be granted to the ho&s;pitals on both &s;ides, and the &s;ick not become pri&s;oners of war, but their per&s;ons and attendants might be priviledged and &s;afe, as was the ca&s;e betwixt the French and Engli&s;h in the wars of Europe.</P>
<P>Yet all the con&s;equences of the &s;ick &s;uffering for want of nece&s;&s;aries&mdash;&s;ad &s;pectacles of human woe pre&s;enting them&s;elves in towns, villages and on the roads, and &s;traggling through the country, thereby exciting the terror as well as the compa&s;&s;ion of the in|habitants; have been a&s;cribed to my department and the officers under me, at a time when we our&s;elves &s;uf|fered, and called in vain for a&s;&s;i&s;tance from other depart|ments, and &s;o far as we were able, became fatigue-men and laborers to the &s;ick and wounded, as we could pro|cure none from the army, and, as I mentioned before, many of our attendants and nur&s;es fled.</P>
<P>At the time of my greate&s;t difficulty to procure an a&s;|&s;ortment of medicines, I gave orders to the Apothecary at Newark to a&s;&s;ort what he had there, which was all that could be got to di&s;pen&s;e; to i&s;&s;ue to all applyer&s;

the enemy had ju&s;t made a de&s;cent above King&s;bridge. I was ordered over the river to view Hacken&s;ack, and to report what numbers of &s;ick could be provided for at that place. On my return, I did accordingly report that if a &s;ufficient number of carpenters and ma&s;ons were &s;et to work immediately to fit up the church, court-hou&s;e, manufactory and a &s;tore hou&s;e or two, &amp;c. &s;ix or &s;even hundred men, and perhaps more might be accommo|dated in the town and neighbourhood; but it would re|quire many workmen, and &s;ome time to prepare places for their convenient reception. I was then ordered back to carry the plan into execution with all po&s;&s;ible diligence. I went accordingly, and next day no le&s;s than 300 men were brought into the neighbourhood for me to look after, though I was quite alone in re&s;pect to help. They daily increa&s;ed in numbers, &s;o that within a few days they amounted to upwards of a thou&s;and. I had left in|&s;tructions for Dr. <HI>Warren,</HI> and a number of Mates and other ho&s;pital officers to follow and attend the &s;ick. (<HI>z</HI>)</P>
<P>At fir&s;t we had neither bread, flour, nor fre&s;h provi|&s;ions in readine&s;s nor were Comm&s;&s;aries at hand, from whom I could obtain any help. General <HI>Green,</HI> to whom I &s;ent to fort Lee for a&s;&s;i&s;tance, was gone over to York-i&s;land. So &s;oon as my hands were &s;trengthened with Dr. <HI>Warren's</HI> and Mr <HI>Zabri&s;ky's</HI> help, and the appoint|ment of a Commi&s;&s;ary and Quarter-Ma&s;ter, difficulties abated by degrees very day, and our affairs got into a more promi&s;ing train. In the mean while the two armies having marched towards the White Plains, a battle was expected. I therefore ha&s;tened to join your Excelleny. On my arrival I found the Surgeons of the General ho&s;|pital, in con&s;equence of orders from head-quarters, to look out for a place for the wounded at a convenient di&s;tance, had pitched upon the church at North-ca&s;tle, as the mo&s;t &s;uitable they could meet with. I went to view it, and to prepare matters if the enemy's troops &s;hould come to action.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="015447_0032_0F99815EF1E577D0">
Whil&s;t we were getting in readine&s;s, a firing of can|non was heard anew, for there had been a firing heard, the day before, at fort Wa&s;hington. On learning it was at the White Plains, every Surgeon of the ho&s;pital then pre&s;ent &s;et out with me, immediately, for the Plains, &s;everal Mates following, with a waggon, to bring the in|&s;truments and dre&s;&s;ings. We fixed near the lines, and I never &s;tirred from thence till the enemy retreated, which was about a week after; nor till your Excellency cro&s;&s;ed the river, to ha&s;ten to the &s;upport of fort Wa&s;hington. In the mean time, the &s;ituation of affairs would not permit your Excellency to give me leave to return to North Ca&s;|tle, but for a few hours, to give directions, and to a&s;&s;i&s;t in providing for the &s;ick and wounded; an ho&s;pital Surgeon, and &s;ome times two or more, with three or four Mates, attending the whole time, at the Plains, in expecta|tion of a &s;econd action.</P>
<P>Here I cannot but feel for the Ho&s;pital Surgeons, who before they could obtain any quarters, except &s;uch as a few hours indu&s;try enabled them to do, in a country which was not well calculated to afford any good, were &s;uddenly overwhelmed with numbers of &s;ick &s;ent to them, as well as the wounded, in time of an engagement, and whil&s;t many of the regimental Surgeons were ab&s;ent in the country, having left their corps in the field, without a&s;&s;i&s;tance, contrary to orders of July 3d, at a time when an engagement was con&s;idered as inevitable, there were few at hand to give any aid. Hence, whil&s;t the ho&s;pital Surgeons were preparing matters at their proper &s;tations in the ho&s;pital, clamors were excited again&s;t them for not being with the troops, and when they were detained at the lines, to &s;upply the places of regimental Surgeons, who ought to have been there; the wounded, who were conveyed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o to the ho&s;pital, naturally demanded the at|tention of the whole body of Surgeons, to admini&s;ter aid to them. (<HI>&amp;</HI>)</P>
<P>When I was at liberty to repair to North-Ca&s;tle, all my applications for workmen, to out the ho&s;pital in or|der,
<PB N="18" REF="015447_0033_0F99815FB78804C8">
to con&s;truct chimneys, and &s;ecure the &s;ick and wounded from cold, the effects of which were &s;everely felt at that time, and of which it is thought &s;ome died, proved abortive. Such then as could not be accomo|dated here, under care of Doctors Adams and Mc Knight, were &s;ent to Stamford and Norwalk, to the amount of above a thou&s;and, under the care of Doctors <HI>Turner</HI> and <HI>Eu&s;tis,</HI> Surgeons of the General ho&s;pital, and every accommodation po&s;&s;ible was provided for them.</P>
<P>Before I go on with this narrative of General Ho&s;pital proceedings, I &s;hall ju&s;t ob&s;erve, that in part of a day and night's time, &s;everal hundred &s;ick and wounded, were tran&s;ported from Long-I&s;land to New-York, amid&s;t a heavy rain, which fell during our retreat. They were landed at different wharves, and carried into different hou&s;es, whil&s;t my&s;elf and tho&s;e about me u&s;ed all our endeavours to collect them together, into barracks, and ho&s;pitals I had provided for them; and although all po&s;&s;ible care was taken to prevent it, yet may of them unavoidably &s;uffered, though we were up great part of the night in this &s;ervice.</P>
<P>So &s;oon as I was able to attend that duty in per&s;on, I gave my a&s;&s;i&s;tance in dre&s;&s;ing the patients, &s;o that there was not a &s;ingle one, of tho&s;e wounded in the action on Long-I&s;land who were brought to the General ho&s;pital at New-York, that I did not dre&s;s my&s;elf; and I a&s;&s;i&s;ted in all operations that I knew of, wherever I was pre&s;ent and could attend; for I always vi&s;ited as many &s;ick offi|cers and others, out of the ho&s;pital, by my&s;elf, and in con|&s;ultation, as was any ways po&s;&s;ible for me to do, con&s;i&s;|tent with my other calls of duty. (<HI>aa</HI>)</P>
<P>How much pains I took by writing and conver&s;ation to a&s;&s;i&s;t in getting the regimental Surgeons on &s;ome footing, &s;atisfactory to them, and u&s;eful to the army, I could adduce many proofs, if required; that I never could effect it, is what I have to lament. The cau&s;es I &s;hall not take up your time to inve&s;tigate. If the plan, now before your Excellency, &s;hould take pleace either in
<PB N="19" REF="015447_0033_0F99815FB78804C8">
whole, or part, it may perhaps effect that de&s;irable purpo&s;e, where my endeavors mu&s;t re&s;t. (<HI>bb</HI>)</P>
<P>The orders and in&s;tructions I have given to the Sur|geons of the General ho&s;pital, at different times, are numerous; &s;ome of them your Excellency read, approved, and &s;ub&s;cribed your&s;elf.</P>
<P>Sometimes when hou&s;es for ho&s;pitals have been a&s;&s;ign|ed me by public authority, I have met with great op|po&s;ition in getting po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of them, from protections in favor of the proprietors and occupiers, or others, as in the ca&s;e of Stuyve&s;ants, and in tho&s;e in the Bowry, where a brigade of militia di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the &s;ick of the hou&s;es, a&s;&s;igned for that purpo&s;e, by the New-York committee. (<HI>cc</HI>)</P>
<P>To bring this narrative of my conduct to a conclu&s;ion. So &s;oon as I heard of the lo&s;s of Fort Wa&s;hington, Fort Lee, Hacken&s;ack and Newark, judging your Excellency would require my pre&s;ence, I left the be&s;t directions I could, for the Surgeons of the General Ho&s;pital on the ea&s;t &s;ide of Hud&s;on's-River, and ha&s;tened to join you, which I did, the day after you cro&s;&s;ed the Delaware. I was di&s;tre&s;&s;ed to find your Excellency entirely de&s;titute of Surgeons, at hand, to take charge of the wounded, in ca&s;e of battle.</P>
<P>With your Excellency's approbation I proceeded to Philadelphia, to lay this matter before Congre&s;s, and get an explanation of the meaning of their re&s;olves of October 9th, re&s;pecting my being &s;tationed on the ea&s;t &s;ide of Hud&s;on's-river. I applied to &s;everal members, and reque&s;ted an audience, but, on account of the &s;itua|tion of affairs at that time, it was impo&s;&s;ible to obtain it. The Congre&s;s was fully employed, and adjoured within a day or two afterwards, to Maryland. The &s;ick were brought daily to the city, in great numbers, objects of pity. For the care of them, I gave the be&s;t advice I could, to Dr. Potts, who was employed by the Council of Safe|ty for that purpo&s;e. Several waggon loads of medicines and ho&s;pital articles, which had been pre&s;erved from fall|ing into the enemy's hands, and &s;ent from New-York to,
<PB N="20" REF="015447_0034_0F998160898D8A98">
Newark, and from thence to Philadelphia, were brought to the college, in no good condition. It was my care to collect from them, what was of mo&s;t value, and chiefly wanted for ho&s;pital u&s;e, and &s;end to Bethlehem. The re&s;t, by order of Congre&s;s, were &s;hipped to Wilmington and Chri&s;teen, where I &s;ent a Surgeon to review and &s;ee them repacked, in good order, and to make out an invoice of the &s;ame, and &s;end it to Congre&s;s.</P>
<P>I returned to head-quarters, and that day received a letter from an honorable member, which I &s;hewed to your Excellency, giving it as his judgement, that it was the de&s;ign of Congre&s;s, I &s;hould attend to the care of the &s;ick on the ea&s;t &s;ide of Hud&s;on's-river, and be re&s;tricted to that place; which I could not but con&s;ider as a &s;ingular re&s;triction for a Director-General.</P>
<P>In obedience, however, to this re&s;olve of Congre&s;s, I determined to repair to that &s;tation, but &s;ound it nece&s;&s;ary to take Bethlehem in my way, as my papers and baggage, and mo&s;t of the ho&s;pital Surgeons and Mates of my department were at that place, and to deliver over to &s;ome proper per&s;ons, for the u&s;e of your Excellency's army, the chief articles of the medicines I had &s;ent there. Of the&s;e however, I re&s;erved a few, and comparatively but a few, of &s;uch as were wanted, with &s;ome few &s;tores, likewi&s;e wanted, for the &s;ick on this &s;ide, together with my in&s;tr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ments and bandages. But your Excellency having &s;een fit to &s;end for the&s;e, by expre&s;s, they were ac|cordingly di&s;patched by the &s;ame me&s;&s;enger.</P>
<P>Of ten thou&s;and Bandages I had prepared for u&s;e in the beginning of the campaign, what with the con&s;ump|tion lo&s;s, &s;upplies to the General Ho&s;pital and regimental Surgeons, few are left.</P>
<P>The difficulties of attending to the wants and demands of &s;o many &s;ick, &s;pread through &s;o great a tract of coun|try, and the clamors which have been rai&s;ed, in con&s;e|quence thereof, have induced me to trouble your Excel|lency with this long and particular detail of facts, and to reque&s;t your Excellency's order for a court of Inquiry,

<P>SENSIBLE of the great difficulties, which have at|tended the department of Director General, owing to a great variety of cau&s;es that were not in my power to govern, by which the &s;ick of the army &s;uffered very much la&s;t campaign; I had ju&s;t fini&s;hed the memorial, which accompanies this containing a narrative of my conduct in that department, with the hope and expectation of ob|taining, from your Excellency's known humanity, and love of ju&s;tice, a court of inquiry re&s;pecting it; that tho&s;e cau&s;es might be examined into, and rightly under&s;tood, and I might have an opportunity of vindicating my&s;elf, before a ju&s;t and candid tribunal, from any allegations that might be laid at my door, of neglect, or mi&s;conduct in the di&s;charge of the duty of my &s;tation, according to the be&s;t of my judgement, knowledge and abilities, when Dr. Fo&s;ter called to &s;hew <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> your Excellency's order to him, of January 22d. It informed him, that as I was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from the Director-General&s;hip by Congre&s;s, he was called upon, as elde&s;t Surgeon, to take charge of the ho&s;pitals on the ea&s;t &s;ide of the river, till a further no|mination to that po&s;t. This di&s;mi&s;&s;ion has taken place, without my being ever notified by Congre&s;s with the rea|&s;ons for it, or having been called upon, to an&s;wer for my conduct, though I had heard from a member, that heavy charges had been brought again&s;t me, for the &s;ufferings of the &s;ick; on which I de&s;ired him to inform Congre&s;s, that I was ready to &s;tand the te&s;t of an examination, and reque&s;ted an audience, immediately, which I could not be favoured with. This I did verbally, and afterwards applied to Congre&s;s, through him, by letter, to which I never received any an&s;wer.</P>
<P>On this account I drew up the pre&s;ent memorial, flat|tering my&s;elf I &s;hould obtain the wi&s;hed for inquiry, from your Excellency.</P>

A di&s;mi&s;&s;ion by Congre&s;s from my &s;tation, without their having acquainted me with the nature of my &s;up|po&s;ed offences, and allowed me a previous hearing, ap|pears to me a very &s;evere, if not unu&s;ual proceeding. I am obliged, therefore, &s;till to trouble your Excellency, to reque&s;t your peru&s;al of the memorial, and to expre&s;s my de&s;ire that it may be laid before Congre&s;s, for their con|&s;idera<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ion.&mdash;It is not, Sir, that I di&s;pute the authority of that augu&s;t Body, to appoint at plea&s;ure, as well as to re|voke their appointment of per&s;ons, to offices of rank and tru&s;t; but when a revocation is made in &s;uch a manner, as not to leave the per&s;on removed an opportunity of ju&s;tifying his proceedings, in ca&s;e any accu&s;ations are brought again&s;t him, it cannot fail of operating to his di&s;advantage, in the eyes of the world.</P>
<P>It is natural, therefore, to expect, and what every man has a right to hope for, that he may, though late, be heard with candor and impartiality, and to wi&s;h that a true &s;tate of his conduct in any public department may be known, that according to the evidence of facts it pre&s;ents, he may be condemned or acquitted.</P>
<P>I propo&s;e to go from hence to Stamford and Norwalk, to deliver up the ho&s;pital &s;tores, with which I have been entru&s;ted, to Dr Fo&s;ter's charge, and then proceed, as I have opportunity, to Philadelphia or Baltimore, for the &s;ettlement of my accounts.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>General-Ho&s;pital, at Cambridge,</HI> <DATE><HI>February,</HI> 1776,</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE nature of my &s;tation having led me to make many reflexions, on the &s;ituation of the &s;ick, in the army, and the means required for their relief, I have been anxious to lay before your Excellency, what appears to me, to be nece&s;&s;ary for this purpo&s;e, and want|ing to render the bu&s;ine&s;s of the General Ho&s;pital more ea&s;y and compleat. I am de&s;irous to &s;ugge&s;t to you, what benefits may be &s;uppo&s;ed to ari&s;e, from the e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of regimental Surgeons and Mates; what are, and ought to be looked upon, as the duties of their place; to &s;hew the in&s;ufficiency of any powers hitherto given them, "by Congre&s;s or your Excellency," to &s;upply the defects "of their &s;tation, which they at pre&s;ent labour under," without &s;ome fixed regulations, and without &s;ome provi&s;ion being made for them, that, for ought I &s;ee, they are almo&s;t wholly de&s;titute of, and which they are at a lo&s;s how to remedy, and without which they can be of little &s;ervice to the &s;ick. This I am willing to under|take at large, and to point out &s;ome plan, for putting it in their power to &s;upply the &s;ick, of their regiments, whil&s;t al|lowed to remain under their care, "with whatever is &s;up|po&s;ed requ&s;ite for the purpo&s;e" At the &s;ame time, I am de|&s;irous of pointing out a method of regulating the expences of the General ho&s;pital, and of furni&s;hing the &s;ick in it with many nece&s;&s;aries and refre&s;hments, "which they at pre&s;ent want," in the mo&s;t &s;uitable and lea&s;t chargeable ways. To do it properly would be a work of time, and I find little lei&s;ure at pre&s;ent for a ta&s;k that would require
<PB N="33" REF="015447_0040_0F998164EBAB5A10">
&s;ome vacancy from the daily avocations of my bu&s;ine&s;s, to effect. Yet I keep the de&s;ign in view, when other nece&s;&s;ary calls of duty will permit.</P>
<P>"But although I cannot perform this work fully now, yet it is nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay &s;omething; our circum&s;tances and &s;ituation require a general explanation of what is wanting." The nature and de&s;ign of a General ho&s;pital is &s;o little under&s;tood, and my particular duty &s;o much mi&s;taken, both by regimental Surgeons and other officers; &s;o many expectations are formed, and &s;o many things looked for, from me, which are impo&s;&s;ible to be complied with, that I apprehend it to be ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary that certain regulations be fixed upon, for the better govern|ment of the ho&s;pital, my&s;elf, and the Surgeons and offi|cers of the ho&s;pital under me, as well as o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> the regimen|tal Surgeons, which all ought to know; by which they may be re&s;pectively kept within their line of duty, with|out interference with each other, and which every officer who has any thing to do with the &s;ick may be apprized of, to prevent mi&s;takes.</P>
<P>To begin with my own department, I beg leave to re|fer your Excellency to the particular duty which is a&s;|&s;igned by the Congre&s;s to the Director-General, and chief Phy&s;ician of the ho&s;pital, and to the powers with which he is ve&s;ted.</P>
<P>His DUTY is to furni&s;h medicines, bedding, and all other nece&s;&s;aries; to pay for the &s;ame, to &s;uperintend the whole, TO MAKE HIS REPORT TO and RECEIVE HIS OR|DERS FROM THE COMMANDER IN CHIEF, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Your Excellency will be plea&s;ed to ob&s;erve that I have never had "any mention made to me of," nor received the lea&s;t in&s;tructions concerning either regimental Sur|geons or regimental &s;ick; and yet there is not perhaps a &s;ingle regimental Surgeon, and even but few officers who do not &s;uppo&s;e they have a right to in&s;i&s;t upon my furni&s;hing every regiment, as well the e&s;tabli&s;hed &s;oldiery, as the militia, with whatever articles they are plea&s;ed to demand from the ho&s;pital, as though it was a &s;tore
<PB N="34" REF="015447_0041_0F99816622DFDF28">
hou&s;e, or magazine for the whole army, "and not con|fined, in the intention of its e&s;tabli&s;hment, to the purpo&s;e of taking care of tho&s;e &s;ick and wounded, that might be reported to it as proper objects, and admitted accord|ingly." Thus, be&s;ides what medicines are allowed, as well to the militia as to every other regiment in the ar|my, regimental Surgeons have a cu&s;tom of making de|mands on the General ho&s;pital for in&s;truments of &s;ur|gery, bandages, linnen, tourniquets, wine, rum, &s;ugar, mola&s;&s;es, chocolate, coffee, butter, candles, &s;oap, brandy, rai&s;ins, rice, flour, Indian meal and fre&s;h meat. They &s;uppo&s;e I am obliged to comply with any order &s;igned by a "regimental" Surgeon or Mate, for tho&s;e articles, in any quantity they &s;ee fit to demand. I have been in|formed, that &s;ome officers have taken it much ami&s;s, if they wanted veal or mutton, that they could not have it from the ho&s;pital, "on &s;ending for it for their own tables." What is more unaccountable, no regimental Surgeons ever thought it their duty to make any report to me of the &s;tate of their &s;ick, to leave me room to judge of the propriety of i&s;&s;uing, or of refu&s;ing to i&s;&s;ue out whatever &s;tores they were plea&s;ed to call for.</P>
<P>To &s;hew in what light the ho&s;pital is viewed, and my duty as Director of it, accounts of &s;oldiers that I know nothing of, and who have never been reported to me for directions about them, are &s;ent to me for payment, and from all quarters, near and afar off. Officers who are &s;ick in the country, at a di&s;tance from the army, under coun|try practitioners, &s;end in their accounts by tho&s;e Doctors for me to di&s;charge.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See W. M. Philips's account, &s;ubjoined to this letter.</NOTE> So numerous and unrea&s;onable are the demands of officers, regimental Surgeons, "and others, directed by them to the Director-General of the ho&s;pital for payment," that were all tho&s;e demands gra|tified, the expences of the &s;ick, as the Commi&s;&s;ary-Ge|neral hath often remarked, would exceed all the expences of the whole army be&s;ides.</P>
<P>"To give a pretext for the propriety of their claims,
<PB N="35" REF="015447_0041_0F99816622DFDF28">
they plead their inability of being furni&s;hed el&s;ewhere with what they want;" the cry of the regimental Sur|geons is, there is no provi&s;ion made for us. "My an|&s;wer is, nor have I any orders to provide for any but what are under my own direction in the General ho&s;pital. They a&s;k where they are to get in&s;truments and dre&s;&s;ings, and what they want for the &s;ick under their care, or of what u&s;e are they, if left unprovided. I refer them to their commanding officers, and to make repre&s;entations of their &s;ituation to them, to apply to Congre&s;s to e&s;tabli&s;h means of furni&s;hing what they want; whatever orders are given me, they &s;hall be obey|ed, but I cannot go beyond my in&s;tructions." Do they imagine that 4 Surgeons and 20 Mates (which are all the Surgeons allowed me in the General ho&s;pital, for an army of 20000 men) employed in attending all the &s;ick and wounded that are &s;ent to them from the whole army, and as they can find, or make lie&s;ure from that employ, con&s;tantly bu&s;ied in preparing lint, bandages, compre&s;&s;es, &s;plints, tourniquets and other dre&s;&s;ings for ho&s;pitals u&s;e in ca&s;e of any con&s;iderable action, mu&s;t be &s;ubjected to their demands, and obliged to unfurni&s;h the ho&s;pital, and give up the labour of their hands, to three or four &s;core of regimental Surgeons and Mates, who were to have no trouble them&s;elves, in making any preparations for their own u&s;e.</P>
<P>Has not your Excellency "recommended the &s;tricte&s;t oeconomy, and" informed me that from the e&s;timates given in to Congre&s;s, it was computed that &pound;. 10,000 per ann. was &s;ufficient to an&s;wer all the demands of the General ho&s;pital, "and that you were apprehen&s;ive the expences already exceeded what was imagined a &s;ufficiency?" The &s;alaries of all the officers in employ, the nur&s;es and atten|dants, nearly equal to half that &s;um, without taking into the account the expence of ho&s;pital furniture, bedding, blan|kets, medicines and in&s;truments. From &s;uch limited funds, for the &s;upport of the General ho&s;pital, can it be expected that between thirty and forty regiments &s;hall
<PB N="36" REF="015447_0042_0F9981669F352E78">
draw &s;upplies intended only for the General ho&s;pital it&s;elf?</P>
<P>In this &s;ituation, I humbly reque&s;t your Excellency's in&s;tructions. "Be plea&s;ed to con&s;ider that" my COMMIS|SION only extends to the care of the HOSPITAL it&s;elf; and yet every regimental Surgeon, apparently, expects me to &s;upply him with whatever he wants, and to prepare every thing to his hand, or to lay the odium of his defi|ciency at my door.</P>
<P>This application of mine does not proceed from any de&s;ire or inclination to &s;hrink from any &s;ervice I can render them; but, if this &s;ervice (contrary to my pre&s;ent duty) is required of me, the means mu&s;t be e&s;tabli&s;hed, and I mu&s;t receive po&s;itive in&s;tructions for it, le&s;t I be deemed guilty of neglecting, or not &s;ufficiently providing for my own department, for the &s;ake of tho&s;e who are not comprehended within it.</P>
<P>On the whole, I think it my duty to repre&s;ent to your Excellency, that I have thought it incumbent on me, to give directions to the &s;tores-keepers of the General ho&s;|pital to i&s;&s;ue no &s;tores from thence, on the bare order of any regimental Surgeon, except Indian meal, rice or oatmeal, and if they want wine, rum, &s;ugar, or other the like &s;tores, they mu&s;t produce an order for the&s;e, counter&s;igned by me, and take a receipt for the &s;ame, to make them accountable for the di&s;po&s;al of what they thus receive, if called upon. I have directed the apothe|cary to i&s;&s;ue out medicines to them, for the u&s;e of each regiment, in &s;uch quantities, as their pre&s;ent occa&s;ions may require, but &s;o as not to unfurni&s;h the ho&s;pital, or exhau&s;t the &s;tock, fa&s;ter than I can get a fre&s;h &s;upply. To enable, you, Sir, to form &s;ome judgment of what is nece&s;&s;ary for the purpo&s;e, I mu&s;t ob&s;erve that &s;uch an army as is now on foot, will require an additional &s;um of two thou&s;and pounds &s;terling per annum at lea&s;t for the u&s;e of the regimental Surgeons, over and above what is nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;upply of the General ho&s;pital it&s;elf. And it will be for ever needy, and even de&s;titute of capi|tal
<PB N="37" REF="015447_0042_0F9981669F352E78">
medicines, if not &s;peedily furni&s;hed with a fre&s;h &s;up|ply, to the amount of two or three thou&s;and pounds: medicines being very &s;carce and dear.</P>
<P>Another ob&s;ervation I beg leave to make is, that every regiment ought to have a &s;mall portable che&s;t, for the whole year at once, and be provided with in&s;truments, bandages and dre&s;&s;ings.</P>
<P>It is not with any view to reflect upon the regimental Surgeons, but for the better purpo&s;e of procuring them relief from their difficulties, that I am obliged to inform your Excellency, that there are but very few of them, as far as I can learn, who have what can be called even a tolerable &s;upply of any, even the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential articles for regimental Surgeons, in&s;truments or bandages, and that they are deluding them&s;elves with a fal&s;e opinion, that in ca&s;e of action, every regimental Surgeon will be immediately furni&s;hed with tho&s;e articles from the ho&s;|pital. I fear, from this circum&s;tances, mo&s;t of them would be extremely at a lo&s;s what to do, or be even u&s;e|le&s;s in a battle.</P>
<P>I would therefore recommend to your Excellency, that "a per&s;on be appointed for the purpo&s;e," and in&s;tructions given for furni&s;hing a regimental che&s;t of medicines, with in&s;truments, lint, tow and bandages, &amp;c. for each regiment; that orders be i&s;&s;ued, that every regimental Surgeon make out a report of what he has of tho&s;e articles in readine&s;s, and a repre&s;entation of what he may further want, to be collected together, in order to judge of their pre&s;ent deficiencies; and that the re|gimental che&s;ts be in&s;pected from time to time. As con|tinual complaints are made of the ignorance and unfit|ne&s;s of many called regimental Surgeons and Mates for that po&s;t, and I find them generally unacquainted with what duties are to be expected of them, in that &s;tation; I would advi&s;e, "if it be thought practicable under pre|&s;ent circum&s;tances," that &s;ome kind of examination be made of their re&s;pective abilities, by a cho&s;en committee; being a practice ob&s;erved in all countries, which is e&s;&s;en|tial
<PB N="38" REF="015447_0043_0F998167AB8D5E48">
to the &s;ervice, and is now e&s;tabli&s;hed in the middle colonies.</P>
<P>"I have been amazed to hear it &s;aid, and that it &s;hould have been thought, even by &s;ome members of Con|gre&s;s, that little u&s;e was expected from regimental Sur|geons, where there was a General ho&s;pital; and this has been given to me as a rea&s;on for their being &s;o much ne|glected, or &s;o ill provided with the means of being u&s;e|ful, and is, perhaps, the be&s;t rea&s;on that can be given that there are comparatively &s;o few among&s;t them, at pre&s;ent, of any tolerable education, experience or know|ledge in the bu&s;ine&s;s and duties of the &s;tation." Before I put an end to this letter, I mu&s;t beg your indulgence whil&s;t I trouble your Excellency with two ob&s;ervations more. The fir&s;t is, that regimental ho&s;pitals and regi|mental Surgeons, under proper regulations and &s;ubor|dination to the General ho&s;pital, are ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, and, in my opinion, may be made extremely &s;erviceable in an army; &s;econdly, were matters &s;o well regulated that whenever any &s;oldier was taken ill, whether &s;ent to the General ho&s;pital, or whether he continued with his regiment, under the care of his proper Surgeon; if his rations were &s;topped for the time, and paid for in money, it would, in my opinion, be &s;ufficient or nearly &s;o, pro|vided he was dieted as he ought to be for a &s;ick man, and as he is directed to be, in the General ho&s;pital, not only to pay for his diet, but to &s;upply him with every nece&s;&s;ary refre&s;hment without any, "or with little" addi|tional expence to the publick, from the &s;tores of the Ge|neral ho&s;pital. To prove this, may require an explanation, which I &s;hall willingly give when called for.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>General Par&s;ons. I am informed by the Commi&s;&s;ary-General, has, to his great credit, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> tried the experiment, and on this plan the &s;ick of his brigade were provided la&s;t &s;ummer with every thing nece&s;&s;ary and comfortable to men in their &s;ituation, and there was a &s;aving of &s;ixty pounds lawful, after every article was paid for, from the &s;toppage of the &s;ick men's rations, and receiving the amount in ca&s;h, in lieu of rations.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="015447_0043_0F998167AB8D5E48">
Permit me, Sir, to conclude with this remark that if the &s;ick in regiments are to be &s;upplied at a public expence, that expence ought to be a regimental charge, and may well enough be included in the ab&s;tract of the regiment. The General ho&s;pital having nothing to do with regi|mental &s;ick, till they are reported to, and admitted as proper objects, ought not to be burdened with the ex|pence. In this manner, the expence of "main|taining the &s;ick in regimental ho&s;pitals will be known," and that of &s;upporting a General ho&s;pi|tal, unmixed with the former, may be pretty exactly a&s;|certained from experience; nor would it be charged with enormous accounts, which the General ho&s;pital, proper|ly &s;peaking, has nothing to do with.</P>

<POSTSCRIPT>
<P>(<HI>b</HI>) P. S. I would ob&s;erve to your Excellency, that the &s;um allowed by Congre&s;s for the payment of the &s;tore-keepers is &s;o in&s;ignificant as four dollars a month; about half the wages of a common &s;oldier; though it is a place of great tru&s;t, and requires talents and applicati|on to bu&s;ine&s;s, as well as integrity to perform it well.</P>
<P>The pay of nur&s;es is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ixt by Congre&s;s at half a dollar per week. Whil&s;t it is &s;o low, we &s;hall never be able to furni&s;h good nur&s;es, or in &s;hort any nur&s;es, in proportion to the number wanted for the &s;ick. They complain of
<PB N="40" REF="015447_0044_0F998167E4462200">
their pay, and are jealous that more is allowed, but that part of it is &s;topped: Mo&s;t of them &s;ay they were promi&s;|ed a dollar per week. I have only paid them what is allowed by my in&s;tructions.</P>
<P>There is a nece&s;&s;ity for having occa&s;ional officers in the General ho&s;pital, of whom no mention is made in the e&s;tabli&s;hment by Congre&s;s. Some &s;uch I have found here on my arrival. They remain without pay, nor is their pay &s;ettled. I have neither confirmed their ap|pointment, nor have I di&s;mi&s;&s;ed them, in&s;tructions being wanted.</P>
<P>It is nece&s;&s;ary that I report to your Excellency the di&s;|mi&s;&s;ion of five Mates from the General ho&s;pital, as, by order of Congre&s;s, they were only employed by the day; and they have refu&s;ed to &s;ubmit to any examination of their qualifications.</P>

<P>From the Doctor's vi&s;its and accounts (which mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed to be very low) compared with the diet, &s;alt pork, wine and rum, &amp;c. it mu&s;t appear how nece&s;&s;ary &s;uch an expen&s;ive attendance was for a private &s;oldier, in the &s;mall-pox, and what idea was entertained of the duty of a Director-General, if liable to pay &s;uch ac|counts.</P>
<P>I had al&s;o before me, at this time, a copy of the drafts of one regimental Surgeon at Cambridge, upon the &s;tore of the General Ho&s;pital, for above an hundred gallons, or an hog&s;head of rum; wine, loaf and brown &s;ugar, and mola&s;&s;es in proportion; and to &s;hew the extreme nece&s;&s;ity, one pint of oatmeal was added to the li&s;t, being for one regiment only; all within the &s;pace of about &s;ix weeks; and yet there was no return made of the &s;ick, but all de|manded on the faith of an order, &s;igned by a regimental Surgeon or Mate.</P>
<P>I &s;hall here likewi&s;e, remark, that, when after regi|mental Surgeons were repeatedly called upon, by general orders, to make reports of the &s;tate of the &s;ick, although many of them never complied at all with tho&s;e orders,
<PB N="43" REF="015447_0045_0F998169D72B7908">
among&s;t tho&s;e who did make their returns, &s;ome indivi|duals reported above an hundred, each. But when Doctor Fo&s;ter, then Surgeon in the General ho&s;pital, attended, by my directions, to vi&s;it, in particular, Col. Par&s;ons's regiment, of which the Surgeon was &s;uddenly taken ill, in order to receive &s;uch as were proper objects, into the General ho&s;pital; on calling over the li&s;t by name to examine their ca&s;es, there were but few of them, who were not found, and did not acknowledge them|&s;elves, to be fit for duty.</P>
<P>In &s;ome returns, of which I took care to keep the ori|ginals, forty waiters and upwards were included on the &s;ick li&s;t, to exempt &s;o many from duty. Some regimen|tal Surgeons made a practice of &s;elling recommendations to furloughs and di&s;charges; for which only one, out of the number &s;uppo&s;ed to merit that di&s;tinction, was drummed out of the army, for &s;uch mean and &s;canda|lous practices Had all who de&s;erved it, met the &s;ame reward, it would have reduced the li&s;t very con&s;iderably. Cordials and refre&s;hments were drawn by others, from the &s;tores of the General ho&s;pital, which by the parts &s;ome of the officers took in &s;upporting the unrea&s;onable demands of tho&s;e men, gave room for many to believe they &s;hared in the plunder them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Is it any wonder, on being repeatedly informed of the&s;e particulars, that I put a total &s;top to the unauthoriz|ed practice of the regimental Surgeons drawing &s;tores from the General ho&s;pital, without obliging them to be accountable for the &s;ame? Is it a matter of &s;urprize that regimental Surgeons and officers of that ca&s;t, &s;hould manife&s;t a declared enmity again&s;t one, who contravened their &s;hameful mea&s;ures; or that they &s;hould have in|fluence with &s;ome of the privates, in concert with whom they preyed on the vitals of the publick, to declaim again&s;t the General ho&s;pital, whil&s;t tho&s;e who were pro|per objects for it, and had once experienced the benefit of that in&s;titution, were glad to have recour&s;e to it, as often as they &s;tood in need?</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="015447_0046_0F99816B15788178">
When the e&s;timate of ho&s;pital expences was &s;o very low, and &s;uch oeconomy, for I may not call it par&s;imony, was manife&s;ted in the pay allowed to the ho&s;pital officers by former re&s;olves of Congre&s;s, &s;o different from the generous munificence of the pre&s;ent day, that four dollars per month, was then thought a &s;ufficiency for the ho&s;pi|tal &s;tore-keepers. [Great proof of its being the inten|tion of Congre&s;s, that they &s;hould i&s;&s;ue &s;tores, to the amount of many hundred thou&s;and dollars per annum, to regimental Surgeons;] is it any wonder that I would not &s;uffer regimental Surgeons to draw, <HI>ad libitum,</HI> for whatever their unbounded appetites and fancies craved from the General ho&s;pital; or, when I di&s;covered &s;o many arts, put in practice, to defraud the publick, that I would pay no accounts of &s;oldiers, out of the ho&s;pital, contracted without my knowledge, and out of the &s;phere of my department? Had I allowed my&s;elf to be drawn into this &s;nare, who can tell what limits they would have &s;et to their growing demands? Some large accounts of private practitioners, were brought to me; from more than an hundred miles di&s;tance. Some of them had charged near five pounds, a day, for attendance on com|mon &s;oldiers, who ailed but little. Had I pa&s;&s;ed tho&s;e accounts would it not have been at the ri&s;k of my own reputation? but why mention reputation? Have I not &s;uffered more obloquy from the malignity of &s;uch men, on account of &s;aving prodigious &s;ums to the Continent, with great toil, but no po&s;&s;ible advantage to my&s;elf, than &s;ome others for engulphing the public monies? Such are the rewards of care and exactne&s;s in bu&s;ine&s;s to &s;erve one's country; glorious pledges of liberty! when offi|cers of rank are to be forced from their &s;tations, to make way for undermining and ambitious men, on their partial repre&s;entations, without any hearing! <HI>oh fortunatos <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">imium, &s;ua &s;i bona no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">int agricol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e!</HI></P>

(<HI>b</HI>) The want of &s;ufficient a&s;&s;i&s;tance from other de|partments was attended with many and great inconve|niences. For example, When it was thought nece&s;&s;ary to e&s;tabli&s;h a General ho&s;pital above King&s;bridge, in the neighbourhood of that wing of the army commanded by Major-General HEATH, in October, after the proper places were pitched upon for that de&s;ign, I called upon the Deputy-Quarter-Ma&s;ter-General for workmen and materials, to put the &s;everal hou&s;es in order, to build chimnies, to con&s;truct births, and to make &s;uitable apart|ments for the &s;ick and wounded. The Q. M. General being then at Philadelphia, the D. Q. M. General in|formed me that every carpenter and ma&s;on under his direction in the army were engro&s;&s;ed, and could not be taken off from their pre&s;ent employ. He advi&s;ed me to make application to General HEATH, for an order, to obtain as many of the militia, or other &s;oldiers who were proper workmen, to be drafted from their re&s;pective re|giments under his command, as would &s;uffice for the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion. I &s;ent to General HEATH for this purpo&s;e. The an&s;wer I received was, that the General did not chu&s;e to meddle with any thing to be done in the Quarter-Ma&s;ter-Generals department. When General MIFFLIN, Quarter-Ma&s;ter-General, returned &s;ome time after from Philadelphia, where he was then gone, I pro|cured an order from him on his Deputy, for a dozen carpenters and ma&s;ons; but they could not be &s;pared from other bu&s;ine&s;s; and not one was &s;ent to me all the time I remained on York-I&s;land, from the biginning of October, to the time of my going over to Hackin&s;ack, after the middle of the month, when the army began to retreat to the White Plains.</P>
<P>The &s;ame thing happened frequently at other times and places particularly at North Ca&s;tle; when, after ear|ne&s;t applications made by my&s;elf and the Surgeons of the General ho&s;pital, to that department, and orders were given by the Quarter-Ma&s;ter-General him&s;elf, or his Deputy, on the Commander of the Artificers, they could
<PB N="46" REF="015447_0047_0F9982B0A1904130">
not be procured, it being always declared that all hands were engaged by prior orders, for other purpo&s;es of the army. I do not mention the&s;e difficulties with a view to reflect upon, either the Quarter-Ma&s;ter-General, or his Deputy. Men of greater activity, or greater abili|ties for the re&s;pective po&s;ts, I do not imagine can be produced: Nor were they wanting in inclination to give me all the a&s;&s;i&s;tance they were capable of affording. But if they had it not in their power, &s;till the inconve|niences were no le&s;s on account of that inclination; yet was I to &s;uffer, and be blamed for wants which neither the whole army, nor perhaps the Congre&s;s it&s;elf; at lea&s;t no other per&s;ons were capable of making a timely provi&s;ion for, and to be an&s;werable, as it would &s;eem for all the misfortunes of the campaign?</P>
<P>When I was at Hackin&s;ack I was expre&s;sly forbidden by the General, to draft any workmen from the army. My whole dependence was placed on &s;uch as I could meet with in the country, and which I ought to have had from the Quarter-Ma&s;ter-General's department; few were to be found in the neighbourhood of the army, when affairs went on otherwi&s;e than pro&s;perou&s;ly. Nor had I any company or guards allotted to me, for any purpo&s;es of the General Ho&s;pital, when I fir&s;t went to Hackin&s;ack, and men were wanting to go after provi&s;ions and for other nece&s;&s;aries, be&s;ides waiting on the &s;ick and wounded, that were hourly brought in great numbers, without any per|&s;ons whatever to attend them.</P>
<P>Once, indeed, when the &s;ick became very numerous, about ten days before the retreat from New-York, and when I &s;tood in greater need than u&s;ual, of an increa&s;e of labourers and waiters in the General Ho&s;pital, and there were no men to be had in the city, who were will|ing to engage in that &s;ervice, after repeated applications for that purpo&s;e, it was given out in general orders, that fifty men &s;hould be drafted from the line, who were al|lotted to that duty. No day pa&s;&s;ed without making per|&s;onal application my&s;elf, to the officers appointed to di|rect
<PB N="47" REF="015447_0047_0F9982B0A1904130">
the performance <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> his order, yet a week pa&s;&s;ed be|fore it was complied with. When the men were parad|ed, and marched to the New-York college, to receive their orders from me, at what ho&s;pitals they were to be employed, and how to be di&s;po&s;ed of, they declared they would not remain there. They &s;aid they were cheated, having been told they were ordered for quite a different duty. I rea&s;oned with them, and &s;hewed the nece&s;&s;ity there was of their help, promi&s;ed to make their &s;ervices as ea&s;y and agreeable to them as po&s;&s;ible, and to allow them each a gill of rum per day, if they behaved well, and threatened them, if they left me, to report them as guilty of di&s;obeying the General's orders. They feigned acquie&s;cence. Yet, by next day, mo&s;t of them had de|&s;erted from the ho&s;pital, and returned to their companies, although, be&s;ides the &s;ick, there were near one hundred wounded to attend. Such was the di&s;cipline of the army at that time. Before I could take any &s;tep to have the&s;e men called to account, I was ordered over to Newark, to provide accommodations for the &s;ick at that place, in the mid&s;t of which, great part of the remaining Waiters, and &s;ome of the Nur&s;es left the ho&s;pital.</P>
<P>AS the following letters, &s;elected from a number of others, written by me, to different members of Congre&s;s, on the bu&s;ine&s;s of my department, bear te&s;timony to the pains I took to give full and timely information to that Body, of the &s;tate of the &s;ick in the General ho&s;pital and the army, of the deficiencies and inconveniences both la|boured under, for want of &s;uitable regulations, and of what &s;upplies were wanting, in time for affording more effectual relief, at lea&s;t in many in&s;tances, had that in|formation been duly attended to by Congre&s;s, I need not make any apology for publi&s;hing them in this place, at full length, and in their original dre&s;s I am not &s;ure, if I were to give only extracts, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> an abridgment of them, that it would be &s;atisfactory.

nor did I expect at the time they were written, that I &s;hould ever think it nece&s;&s;ary to print them. Be&s;ides, in bu&s;ine&s;s of &s;o much importance, I imagine it will be con&s;idered as a le&s;s fault, to be minute and particular, and even to repeat the &s;ame things, in the hurry of writ|ing, than to give &s;o cur&s;ory a relation, as to fail of an|&s;wering the de&s;ign of affording full information of what|ever falls under the writer's notice, that may inform tho&s;e in office of the true &s;tate of his department, and be any further inducement to them, than they already have, to exert them&s;elves, in giving all the timely a&s;&s;i&s;tance that is needful, to remedy every want, or remove every incon|venience under which it labours.</P>
<P>On my arrival from Cambridge, at New-York, the latter end of May, 1776, I found &s;everal orders, drawn upon me, from the Northern Army, for &s;upplies of medicines and in&s;truments, and particularly for a large &s;upply of medicines from Doctor Stringer, Director in that department. I heard from a number of officers, of great rank, who were ju&s;t returned from Philadelphia, that Congre&s;s expected me, as Director General, to or|der the nece&s;&s;ary &s;upplies of Ho&s;pital &s;tores, for the Northern department. I had received no &s;uch orders. As I thought proper regulations were wanting, to a&s;cer|tain the re&s;pective limits of authority, intended by Con|gre&s;s to be ve&s;ted in my&s;elf, and the &s;everal Directors, I reque&s;ted leave to go to Philadelphia, to obtain an audience of a committee of Congre&s;s, on that &s;ubject, which I obtained. I left propo&s;als of &s;everal regula|tions with that committee, for introducing order into the different branches of the General Ho&s;pital depart|ment. Among&s;t others, I propo&s;ed that the &s;everal Directors and Superintendants of Ho&s;pitals, &s;hould be ordered and impowered to provide their re&s;pective de|partments with Ho&s;pital &s;tores, without depending on me for &s;upplies; it being impo&s;&s;ible for me, circum|&s;tanced as I was, to an&s;wer their demands. Nothing was determined till a month afterwards. In the mean
<PB N="49" REF="015447_0048_0F998296878AE880">
while, upon my return to New-York, Doctor Potts, who had a &s;eparate charge of certain Ho&s;pitals, which were to be e&s;tabli&s;hed to the Northward, applyed to me for the appointment of Surgeons and other Ho&s;pital officers to act under him, and for a farther &s;upply of medicines, than he had yet obtained. He expre&s;&s;ed it as his opinion, that he was obliged, in duty, to look to me for a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and &s;aid he &s;hould depend upon me only, as head of the department, for every thing of which he &s;hould &s;tand in need. At the &s;ame time, Doctor Lind, applied to me for medicines, for General Sullivan's army, on which, I wrote the following Let|ter.</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>TO THE HONORABLE SAMUEL ADAMS, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> Member of the Medical Committee of Congre&s;s.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>New-York,</HI><DATE><HI>June</HI> 25, 1775.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE &s;tate of the army in Canada, according to Dr. Lind's account, (who is ju&s;t arrived from thence, by order of General Sullivan, for a &s;upply of medicines,) is truly deplorable. I have &s;een no return of the &s;ick, but he a&s;&s;ures me, that in the beginning of this month, there were no le&s;s than 1800 men down with the &s;mall-pox; and the total of &s;ick and unfit for duty, amounted to 3,300 men; and he &s;ays, they have no medicines: Such a report is &s;carcely credible, but you may learn the particulars, your&s;elf, from him, as he intends going to Philadelphia.</P>
<P>General Gates &s;ets out to-morrow, to take the com|mand of the army in Canada. Dr. Potts will accom|pany
<PB N="50" REF="015447_0049_0F99829C722B6240">
him. I have therefore given orders to &s;upply him, from the General Ho&s;pital, with a large che&s;t of &s;uch medicines as I can be&s;t &s;pare; and which can be got ready to-morrow before his departure. Upon looking into Dr. Potts's commi&s;&s;ion, I find he is appointed Phy&s;ician and Surgeon in the department of Canada; but whether it be of a regiment, or in the Ho&s;pital, is not &s;pecified; nor does it &s;hew whether it is the inten|tion of Congre&s;s, to ve&s;t him with the power of a Director, in the General Ho&s;pital: Nor can I learn, what appointment Dr. Stringer has, or what is the na|ture of his commi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>From all I am able to learn, every thing in the medi|cal department, in Canada, di&s;plays one &s;cene of con|fu&s;ion and anarchy: Nor have the Congre&s;s taken upon it&s;elf, to e&s;tabli&s;h, or ve&s;ted any per&s;on whatever, with a power &s;ufficient to e&s;tabli&s;h a General Ho&s;pital in Ca|nada.</P>
<P>The Congre&s;s cannot, in my humble opinion, be too &s;peedy in determining what &s;teps are to be taken for this purpo&s;e, and for &s;ettling a due &s;ubordination among&s;t the Surgeons there. It would be of particular u&s;e, that the intentions of Congre&s;s were made known in re|&s;pect to Dr. Stringer and Dr. Potts, whether either of them is to be con&s;idered as Director, by appointment of Congre&s;s, and which of them; or whether they are both to be looked upon as Surgeons depending on, and acting by in&s;tructions from me. I have never &s;een Dr. Stringer's commi&s;&s;ion. In either ca&s;e, they will require more help than they have at pre&s;ent; and in the latter, I &s;uppo&s;e I ought to have the appointment of three or four more Ho&s;pital Surgeons, an Apothecary, and a &s;ufficiency of Mates in that department, without dim<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">|ni&s;hing the number I have allowed me for the army at New-York, as I have none here that are &s;uperfluous. Other officers, as a Storekeeper, Stewart and Matron, are al&s;o wanted in Canada, with Nur&s;es and occa&s;ional Labourers. Whatever is determined on, in re&s;pect to
<PB N="51" REF="015447_0049_0F99829C722B6240">
the&s;e matters, I &s;hould be glad to know immediately: Till then, my hands are tied up, and the army &s;uffering for want of help. I am not &s;ure that our di&s;grace and misfortunes in Canada are not owing, in a great mea|&s;ure, to the &s;hameful proceedings of the Surgeons, in &s;preading the &s;mall-pox by innoculation, among&s;t the &s;ol|diery, in face of the enemy. In&s;tead of innoculating the &s;oldiery, under like circum&s;tances before Bo&s;ton, General Wa&s;hington, upon my repre&s;entation, conti|nued to keep in pay a Surgeon and Mate, to attend all that fell ill of the &s;mall-pox. A Ho&s;pital was fixed for their reception only, in a retired place, and a guard &s;et round it, and all communication betwixt it and the ar|my was cut off; and &s;o &s;oon as any one was &s;eized with the infection, of whatever rank, he was &s;ent to the &s;mall-pox Ho&s;pital. By this means, every inconvenien|cy, ari&s;ing from the appearance of the &s;mall-pox, was prevented, and the army effectually &s;ecured from dan|ger, from that quarter.</P>
<P>Had there been a General Ho&s;pital in Canada, there would have been better orders, and &s;ome &s;ubordination ob&s;erved, which is now wholly wanting; and it is to be feared, that whil&s;t the Congre&s;s, occupied in a mul|tiplicity of weighty concerns, can proceed but &s;lowly on this matter, the opportunity may be lo&s;t. Rather than po&s;tpone, however, &s;o important a concern, would it not be right to place full confidence and power in a pro|per per&s;on, capable to arrange the&s;e matters, as they ought to be, with ample authority for the purpo&s;e, ra|ther than &s;uffer a lo&s;s of men, to the di&s;couragement of the whole army, for want of a due provi&s;ion being made for the &s;ick and wounded.</P>
<P>If the Congre&s;s will &s;ix on the means and manner of e&s;tabli&s;hing a General Ho&s;pital at Canada, it will ea&s;e me of much trouble; but if they are not at lei&s;ure, or not &s;ufficiently acquainted with what is the proper manner, and will order me to do it for them, giving me &s;uch power as they think adequate, I will do the be&s;t I can,

to effect this de&s;irable end immediately. Excu&s;e, Sir, my dwelling &s;o earne&s;tly on this &s;ubject; it is of the ut|mo&s;t con&s;equence to the &s;ervice, and delays are danger|ous. I cannot expect to receive in&s;tructions, on this matter, from General Wa&s;hington; he &s;uppo&s;es, that I under&s;tand the affairs of this department, and relies wholly on me for every thing which relates to it. <HI>But I neither dur&s;t, nor will I pre&s;ume, to meddle in affairs, out of my province, or that are beyond the &s;phere, in which I &s;uppo&s;e, I was de&s;igned originally, by Congre&s;s, to move.</HI>&mdash;Such, I imagine, is the arrangement of Ho&s;pital affairs, in Canada, and the undertaking to &s;upply the Surgeons there with what is nece&s;&s;ary for a General Ho&s;pital, without fre&s;h in&s;tructions, or more ample power than I now have, either from the Con|gre&s;s or Commander in Chief, as my commi&s;&s;ion directs me to look to them, for orders.</P>
<P>I wait, impatiently, for an order from Congre&s;s, to impower me to demand &s;uch a proportion of the Con|tinental medicines, left in the care of Me&s;&s;ieurs De Lan|cy and Smith, as they may think fit to allot for this de|partment. In determining that proportion, they will plea&s;e to con&s;ider (if we can tru&s;t to Dr. Lind's account) that there is not an article of medicine in Canada, in the hands of any Surgeon on that expedition.</P>
<P><HI>June</HI> 26, 1776. Since writing the above, Dr. Potts having received a &s;upply of medicines, from the Gene|ral Ho&s;pital &s;tore, Dr. Lind has &s;et off with General Gates and him, for Canada.</P>

<P>BEFORE I proceed to exhibit a copy of the next letter, which I wrote to Congre&s;s, it will not be im|proper to inform the reader of the occa&s;ion of it.</P>
<P>Having been returned from Philadelphia, about a fortnight after my conference with the Medical Com|mittee of Congre&s;s, in which I had &s;et forth my in&s;uf|ficiency, without farther powers and in&s;tructions to an&s;wer all the calls daily made on me, in an exten&s;ive and un&s;ettled department; and, having received no or|ders or directions from Congre&s;s, all this while, in an|&s;wer to my application for that purpo&s;e: A powerful fleet and army from Great-Britain, intended for the re|duction of New-York, being likewi&s;e already arrived on the coa&s;t; and having prepared every thing in my de|partment that was in my power. I then con&s;idered the un&s;ettled &s;tate of the regimental Surgeons in order to bring them, by degrees, into greater regularity, and to make them more u&s;eful in ca&s;e of action, as many of them had but newly entered the &s;ervice, and mo&s;t of them, from want of experience, were yet novices in the duties of a military Surgeon I thought it advi&s;ea|ble to give them &s;ome in&s;tructions which might <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> their minds to a &s;en&s;e of what duty was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> them, as regimental Surgeons, in time of action <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> it could not be &s;uppo&s;ed, was very di&s;tant, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> drew up the following directions and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> them to the General.&mdash;He approved of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> of the day; and commanded the &s;everal <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">

<P>Each Surgeon was allowed a copy, and commonly, at the &s;ame time, I gave him an order on the Apothe|cary, of the General Ho&s;pital, for a medicine che&s;t, for every Battalion, which he al&s;o obtained, if he was not already provided, together with a number of bandages and tourniquets and a quantity of lint, tow, and old linnen, for chirurgical dre&s;&s;ings.</P>

<P>Part of the General Ho&s;pital is now fixed at Long-I&s;land, for the reception of &s;ick and wounded per&s;ons, who&s;e ca&s;es may require it; which JOHN WARREN, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> Surgeon in the General Ho&s;pital is appointed to &s;uperintend and direct, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of three
<PB N="56" REF="015447_0052_0F99829E62123AA0">
Ho&s;pital Mates, and &s;uch other Regimental Surgeons and Mates, belonging to that part of the army &s;tationed at Long-I&s;land, as may be required. In ca&s;e of evident nece&s;&s;ity, ari&s;ing from an attempt being made on Fort Defiance, (afterwards called Fort Wa&s;hington,) two of the Ho&s;pital <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, with Doctor M'Henry now at Mont e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">or I&s;land, and whom he is to &s;uperintend and direct, are to repair to that po&s;t, with a proper a&s;&s;ort|ment of in&s;truments and bandages The remainder of the Surgeons and Mates of the General Ho&s;pital, are to continue at King's-College, and New-York Ho&s;pital, for the reception and care of &s;uch wounded as are &s;ent to them, from what ever part. It being the duty of the Regimental Surgeons and Mates, in ca&s;e of action, in the field, to attend the Corps to which they belong, in order to dre&s;s the wounded in battle; they are to take po&s;t in the rear of the troops engaged in action, at the di&s;tance of three, four, or five hundred yards behind &s;ome convenient hill, if at hand, there to dre&s;s the wounded, who require to be dre&s;&s;ed, on or near the field of battle If the Regiment or Corps to which they belong, are engaged within a fort, or lines thrown up for defence, that fort or place of defence, is then the proper &s;tation for the Regimental Surgeons: But as a Regiment may be divided, and di&s;tributed into different po&s;ts, &s;o as to render it impracticable for the Regiment|al Surgeon and Mate, belonging to that Regiment, to be near &s;ome parts of their Corps, it is nece&s;&s;ary that, an account of the number of Surgeons and Mates, in any Brigade, or any divi&s;ion of the army, that occupies one or more detached po&s;ts, be taken, and delivered to the Commanding Officer of &s;aid po&s;ts or divi&s;ion. It is to be con&s;idered as the duty of each Regimental Sur|geon and Mate re&s;pectively, wherever &s;tationed, to re|gard him&s;elf, as having a joint charge of the whole Bri|gade, with the re&s;t of the Surgeons of that Brigade, rather than as if his care was to be confined only to tho&s;e officers and &s;oldiers who are of the Regiment to
<PB N="57" REF="015447_0052_0F99829E62123AA0">
which he belongs. It mu&s;t unavoidably happen, at times, that both officers and &s;oldiers may be wounded in action, and their particular Surgeons be el&s;ewhere employed, &s;o as not to be able to attend them. The amputation of a limb, or performance of any capital operation, cannot well take place in the heat of a bri&s;k action: It is &s;eldom po&s;&s;ible, or requi&s;ite. What the Surgeon has chiefly to attend to in ca&s;es of per&s;ons be|ing much wounded in the field of battle, is to &s;top any flux of blood, either by tourniquet, ligature, lint and compre&s;s, or a &s;uitable bandage, as the ca&s;e may require; to remove any extraneous body from the wound; to re|duce fractured bones; to apply proper dre&s;&s;ings to wounds; taking care on the one hand, not to bind up the parts too tightly, &s;o as to injure the blood's circu|lation, increa&s;e inflammation, and excite a fever; or &s;o loo&s;ely, as to endanger the wounds bleeding afre&s;h, or to allow broken bones, after they are properly &s;et, to be again di&s;placed. The wounded being thus dre&s;&s;ed by the Regimental Surgeons, are next to be removed to the neare&s;t Ho&s;pital belonging to the Brigade, or to the General Ho&s;pital, as may be mo&s;t convenient.</P>
<P>As the General Ho&s;pital may at times, be fully croud|ed with &s;ick per&s;ons, or in the time of action, &s;o many wounded may be &s;ent there, as to require a greater number of hands, than that part of the General Ho&s;pi|tal, where many of the wounded are &s;ent, is furni&s;hed with, it may be ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;uperintend|ing Surgeon, be&s;ides the proportion allowed him, from the General Ho&s;pital, to call for the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a num|ber of Surgeons and Mates, from the Brigade, divi&s;ion or part of the army where he is, either before an en|gagement, or, when the number of wounded per&s;ons &s;ent to him becomes very great, making &s;uch a&s;&s;i&s;tance needful. For this purpo&s;e, he is to apply to the Com|mander of that Brigade, or part of the army, who is hereby ordered to &s;end him as many Regimental Sur|geons

<P>IN con&s;equence of the foregoing plan and orders, &s;ome reports were made, although <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">y came in but &s;lowly. Near a fortnight pa&s;&s;ed over before I received them from more than fifteen Regimental Surgeons: It is to be a&s;cribed, if not to that backwardne&s;s which the Regimental Surgeons ever &s;hewed to complying with
<PB N="59" REF="015447_0053_0F99829F92BC6EB8">
General Orders, perhaps, to a con&s;cious &s;hame of being entirely de&s;titute of any nece&s;&s;ary articles, but what they had been previou&s;ly indulged to draw from the General Ho&s;pital: Some of them, whom I afterwards met, and inquired into the cau&s;e of their neglect, con|fe&s;&s;ed this to be the truth. As my intention in de&s;iring tho&s;e reports to be made to me, was, to lay them be|fore the General and Congre&s;s, with remarks on their in&s;ufficiency, that the Medical Committee might be in|cited to u&s;e more diligence, than heretofore, to fall on &s;ome mea&s;ures for &s;upplying the Regimental Surgeons, with every nece&s;&s;ary to qualify them for greater u&s;eful|ne&s;s in their &s;tation. I drew up, from the &s;eparate re|ports delivered to me, one general return of the &s;tate of the abovementioned fifteen Regiments. All the in|&s;truments were reported to be private property, and amounted to &s;ix &s;ets of amputating in&s;truments, two of trepanning ditto, fifteen ca&s;es of pocket in&s;truments, &s;eventy-five crooked, and &s;ix &s;trait needles. Among&s;t the whole fifteen Surgeons, there were only four &s;calp|els or inci&s;ion knives, for dilating of wounds, or any other purpo&s;e; three pair of forceps, for extracting bullets; half a paper and &s;eventy pins; and but few bandages, ligatures or tourniquets, and as little old lin|nen, lint or tow, but what they had procured from the General Ho&s;pital; and only two ounces of &s;punge in all. Amazing deficiency for fifteen Surgeons, and as many Mates!</P>
<P>Upon inquiry how they could think of marching with their Regiments, without providing, at lea&s;t, old linnen for dre&s;&s;ings; or of joining the army, without the ne|ce&s;&s;ary in&s;truments, as, if ever they reflected at all, they mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible of the impropriety of &s;o doing, and of its being much ea&s;ier for each man, to procure tho&s;e ar|ticles, within the &s;phere of his acquaintance, connex|ions or neighbourhood, than to obtain them in an ar|my, in general, de&s;titute of nece&s;&s;ary &s;upplies, of what was not to be procured in America, but with great dif|ficulty.
<PB N="60" REF="015447_0054_0F9982A01A7ACF00">
Their con&s;tant an&s;wer was, whenever they applied to their &s;uperior officers for tho&s;e things, they were always told, they would be furni&s;hed with every thing they wanted, &s;o &s;oon as they &s;hould have joined the army. Upon being informed that I had only a &s;uf|ficiency of tho&s;e articles for the u&s;e of the General Ho&s;pital, and that I would by no means unfurni&s;h it, to &s;upply them, they appeared quite confounded, and expre&s;&s;ed great unea&s;ine&s;s, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> having no proper e&s;tab|li&s;hment; and &s;aid, they knew not how, or where to obtain the nece&s;&s;ary articles, to be any ways u&s;eful in the army, if I did not a&s;&s;i&s;t them.</P>
<P>As I was not ignorant of the many inconveniencies, under which they had hitherto laboured, from a want of attention in the Congre&s;s to relieve, or place them on a better footing, and as I felt for their di&s;tre&s;s, I a&s;|&s;ured them of my readine&s;s to a&s;&s;i&s;t them, all in my power, con&s;i&s;tently with my proper duty, and the or|ders I had, or &s;hould receive from Congre&s;s. I advi&s;ed them to meet in a body; to conver&s;e on the matter with each other; and then chu&s;e one or more Deputies, from each Brigade, to &s;tate their helple&s;s &s;ituation, and pray for relief; in which I was willing to &s;econd their application, with all the influence of which I was ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>As they complained much of not being allowed pro|per Regimental Ho&s;pitals, and, as I had, in oppo&s;ition to what always appeared to me to be the &s;entiments, both of the Congre&s;s and General, ever uniformly given it as my opinion, that Regimental Surgeons and Regimental Ho&s;pitals, under proper regulations, and due &s;ubordination to the General Ho&s;pital, might be ve|ry u&s;eful, I took that matter under my con&s;ideration. I likewi&s;e drew up a memorial, and propo&s;als, to be &s;hewn to the General, for his approbation and concurrence, to be laid before Congre&s;s. At the &s;ame time, I penned for the u&s;e of the Regimental Surgeons, a form, and directions for keeping a proper regi&s;ter of the &s;ick, and

<OPENER><DATELINE>New-York, <DATE>July, 1776.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>HAVING put the General ho&s;pital on a good footing at New-York, and provided it with a pretty con&s;iderable &s;tock of what it may &s;tand in need of (as a general ho&s;pital) I have thought it my duty to turn my attention to the regimental Surgeons. Their &s;ituation, ever &s;ince I have been in the army, has been &s;uch as to require a great deal of regulation.</P>
<P>If I were to confine my&s;elf to the true and proper bu&s;ine&s;s of Director General of the ho&s;pital, I &s;hould have very little concerns with them as regimental Sur|geons, according to the plan of the Briti&s;h e&s;tabli&s;hment. It would be principally confined to the receiving &s;uch &s;ick from them, into the General ho&s;pital, as they could not take care of them&s;elves; to a&s;&s;i&s;t in the examination of &s;uch as offered them&s;elves candidates for the places of Surgeons and Mates; and to give orders to them to &s;up|ply them&s;elves with proper medicinal che&s;ts, for each regiment, and all the in&s;trnments and implements nece&s;|&s;ary for them to be provided with, and &s;ee it done. The making provi&s;ion of tho&s;e articles &s;hould depend on them&s;elves; but they ought to be &s;upplied with the means, whether by an allowance of money adequate to the provi&s;ion, or by a &s;toppage from the mens pay.</P>
<P>I found them, upon enquiry, de&s;titute of every arti|cle, whether of medicines, in&s;truments, bandages or other implements of &s;urgery; and not knowing where to provide what was nece&s;&s;ary, or who to look to for a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="015447_0058_0F9982A3DB6CE3A8">
With a view to promote the &s;ervice all that lay in my power, I have attempted to bring them together, to exa|mine into the &s;tate of their wants; to point out what they ought to be furni&s;hed with; to direct them where to look for &s;upplies; and to bring them under &s;ome proper regulations.</P>
<P>To an&s;wer the&s;e &s;everal purpo&s;es, I began, by reque&s;t|ing the General to i&s;&s;ue out orders for each Surgeon, to make a return of what medicines he had on hand. To my &s;orrow, I mu&s;t &s;ay it, excepting two or three Regiments, the &s;tock of all the Regiments at Cam|bridge put together, would &s;carcely have made one good che&s;t. I procured all I could get at Bo&s;ton, and have, from thence, and from &s;ome purcha&s;es of &s;hops at Sa|lem and &s;ome articles I got at Newport, Norwich and New-York, furni&s;hed Regimental che&s;ts to all the Re|gimental Surgeons, who have hitherto applied, to the amount of near twenty; and am &s;till furni&s;hing all the new regiments that daily come in.</P>
<P>In the next place, I &s;ketched out a plan of conduct, for the Surgeons of Regiments in ca&s;e of action, of which the General approved, and gave out in orders, that they &s;hould attend, and take directions from me, on that head<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See that plan and orders of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> Page 50.</NOTE>. At the &s;ame time, I de&s;ired a re|port to be delivered in, of their Surgeons in&s;truments, and bandages fit for u&s;e, agreeable to a form give them for the purpo&s;e. Fifteen Regimental Surgeons made their returns accordingly; from which I have drawn up one general return, to &s;hew the amount: I &s;uppo&s;e them to be, at lea&s;t, as well provided as any others, that have neglected to pay due attention to the order; and do find, that the Regiments now coming in have Surgeons and Mates, but not one article of medicine, or any thing in the way of Surgery, but all depend on me for &s;upplies.</P>
<P>I have &s;ketched out, what in my opinion, every Re|giment ought to be &s;upplied with, in the way of in&s;tru|ments.
<PB N="69" REF="015447_0058_0F9982A3DB6CE3A8">
By comparing this &s;ketch, with the returns made for fifteen Regiments, the great want of every thing e&s;&s;ential to them, as Surgeons, will be evident.</P>
<P>To make amends for their defect, I am well off in the Gen. Ho&s;pital, except in a few particulars. I have provided 10,000 bandages, have &s;ome hundred old &s;heets, and a &s;tock of medicines (tho' una&s;&s;orted;) I have of capi|tal in&s;truments nearly enough for Ho&s;pital u&s;e. But, in the mean time, what is to become of the Regimental Surgeons? Should I divide my &s;tores among&s;t them, they would be di&s;&s;ipated, and our&s;elves left de&s;titute. To ob&s;erve a medium. I have ordered to be i&s;&s;ued from the General Ho&s;pital &s;tores, 60 bandages, 2 &s;heets, 4 tourniquets, a quantity of lint and tow, and a che&s;t of medicines, out of what I have collected with the a&s;|&s;i&s;tance of the Ho&s;pital Surgeons and Mates, who bare no proportion, in number, to the Regimental Surgeons and Mates, (there being, perhaps, 40 Regiments here,) re&s;erving the re&s;t to &s;upply that particular part of the army which may &s;tand in mo&s;t need: But of in&s;tru|ments, I have none to &s;pare, and I begin to want &s;ome capital medicines.&mdash;Moreover, &s;ymptoms of a putrid fever begin to appear.</P>
<P>In this &s;ituation, I have called many of the Regi|mental Surgeons together; have had a conference with them; de&s;ired a deputation from each Brigade; have given them a plan of regulations for Regimental Ho&s;|pitals, and a form of a memorial, or repre&s;entation to Congre&s;s They all look to me, for &s;upplies of every thing they want: I have no authority for that purpo&s;e. It is contrary to my judgment to &s;upply them with all they want. To prove this, I refer you to all who know any thing of the matter. I refer you to Dr. Ba&s;s, in Philadelphia, who knows the&s;e matters as well as any man: I refer you to a copy of a letter, on this &s;ubject, from a man of experience, which I enclo&s;e<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the next letter.</NOTE>.

line of duty more than di&s;obey, or go contrary to them. It is the &s;ame thing. I call for orders. I &s;hall &s;hrink from no fatigue: Say what is my duty, and to the be&s;t of my power, I will obey: But leave me not without orders Every General, every Colonel of a Regiment, every &s;urgeon in the army think I have full power, and ample in&s;tructions, and know not where to apply for the relief of their men, if &s;ick or wounded, and needing uncommon &s;upplies, if I cannot afford them.

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>LAST week, I received yours, of the 1&s;t in&s;t. The Regimental Surgeons were never allowed medicines from the Ho&s;pital, unle&s;s their own happen|ed to be expended, from being long encamped in a part of the country, where none could po&s;&s;ibly be got: And to prevent their being out of medicines, as much as po&s;&s;ible, previous to their taking the field, their medicine che&s;ts were always examined, by order of the Commander in Chief, by the officers of the Ho&s;pital; to &s;ee they were provided with their proper &s;tores for the &s;ervice they were going upon, and a report was made to the Commander in Chief, accordingly.</P>
<P>When it was found proper to deliver them medicines, they were no more than might &s;erve them till they went into quarters, or could be &s;upplied from any neighbour|ing place. AS TO ANY OTHER STORES, I never knew them once thought of, or demanded.</P>
<P>Every Regiment had an Ho&s;pital to it&s;elf, for &s;light ca&s;es, which the Surgeon and his Mates took care of; the charges of which were always defrayed by the Re|giment.</P>
<P>The medicinal and chirurgical &s;tores for the Ho&s;pi|tal were, for every campaign, fixed and ordered, the preceeding winter, by the Phy&s;icians, Apothecaries and Surgeons, in a joint con&s;ultation.</P>
<P>To give you our long li&s;ts of medicines, &amp;c. ("<HI>on any expedition la&s;t war, as you reque&s;t,</HI>") would avail you little at pre&s;ent, as many of the articles are not to

be had; nay, I am certain, one half of them might, at any time, be left out: When you come to town, you &s;hall &s;ee them; They are too long for a letter.</P>
<P>We always made our own bandages, &s;plints, tourni|quets, &amp;c. from old linnen, leather, &amp;c. we &s;ent out on purpo&s;e. We had never le&s;s than five hundred old &s;heets, and two or three hundred &s;kins came out at once, which the Ho&s;pital Mates made into the different kinds of bandages, &amp;c. in common u&s;e.</P>
<P>General Gates can inform you, that the e&s;timates I gave in for the Ho&s;pital, including the pay of the offi|cers, were ten thou&s;and pounds for the fir&s;t &s;ix months, for ten thou&s;and men, and in the &s;ame proportion for a larger number.</P>

<P>IN the &s;ame packet, with the foregoing letter to the Medical Committee of Congre&s;s, page 67; I in|clo&s;ed a variety of papers for their con&s;ideration, name|ly, copies of the in&s;tructions given to the Regimental Surgeons July the third, page 54; of their intended memorial to Congre&s;s, page 62; of the regulations propo&s;ed and agreed upon with them, for the allow|ance of Regimental Ho&s;pitals, page 64; of the pre|ceeding letter, from a gentleman at Philadelphia, very conver&s;ant in the &s;ubject, to &s;hew what were the u&s;ages and cu&s;toms of the General Ho&s;pital, in the Briti&s;h &s;er|vice; and particularly to declare what kind of &s;tores, and under what circum&s;tances, the Regimental Sur|geons were allowed to draw from the General Ho&s;pi|tal in that &s;ervice, page 72; and of the foregoing re|port of in&s;truments and bandages nece&s;&s;ary for every Regiment, page 73; together with copies of the dif|ferent diet tables, and other regulations of the General Ho&s;pital. The&s;e were &s;everally indor&s;ed and numbered, being calculated for the purpo&s;e, and intended to an|&s;wer the promi&s;e I had made his EXCELLENCY GE|NERAL WASHINGTON, in the beginning of my let|ter to him, of March, page 32; by explaining the na|ture, both of the General and Regimental Ho&s;pitals;
<PB N="75" REF="015447_0061_0F9982A6AE98F098">
pointing out the u&s;es and proper government of each; their &s;eparate and di&s;tinct de&s;igns; the means of &s;up|plying the Regimental, and rendering them more u&s;e|ful, by placing them in a due &s;ubordination to the Ge|neral, Ho&s;pitals. I did not doubt the works being ac|ceptable, both to the General and the Congre&s;s, as it might be &s;uppo&s;ed, they were not much ver&s;ed them|&s;elves, in the&s;e matters; with which, however, it was nece&s;&s;ary for the good of the &s;ervice, they &s;hould be acquainted.</P>
<P>To under&s;tand the better what were the u&s;es of the copies of the different diet tables, and of other regu|lations of the General Ho&s;pital, which accompanied my letter to the Medical Committee of Congre&s;s; and to demon&s;trate, at the &s;ame time, what pains I was at, to introduce method and exactne&s;s into every branch of the department entru&s;ted to my care, as I have omitted to mention the particulars before, it will be very proper to take notice, in this place, of the &s;teps I had taken for that purpo&s;e, when at Cambridge.</P>
<P>So &s;oon after my arrival in the army as to have been able to take a review of the &s;tate, in which the General Ho&s;pital then was, I appointed a meeting of the Ho&s;|pital Surgeons to take under con&s;ideration the proper &s;teps to be pur&s;ued for the better government of the Ho&s;pital. I, therefore, in the fir&s;t place, &s;hewed them my commi&s;&s;ion, with the in&s;tructions from Congre&s;s for the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the General Ho&s;pital; I ex|plained to them my idea, of the duties of the &s;everal officers, and gave them a form of the various returns which I expected <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> be made, on the various occa&s;ions of the Ho&s;pital, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> laid before them the different diet tables that were in u&s;e, in the General Ho&s;pital of the Briti&s;h army, la&s;t war, as well as tho&s;e in the different Ho&s;pitals of London and We&s;tmin&s;ter, with all the re|gulations ob&s;erved, in each di&s;tinct part and office, for the government of St. Thomas's Ho&s;pital, which I had procured at the time I was pupil there, under the cele|brated
<PB N="76" REF="015447_0062_0F9982A77106CFD0">
Phy&s;icians, Milner, Aken&s;ide and Ru&s;&s;ell, and brought with me to the army.</P>
<P>With the&s;e regulations before us, compared with the nature and di&s;ea&s;es of the climate, and tho&s;e incident to an army, with the provi&s;ions of the country, and manner of living, as well as the nature of our e&s;tabli&s;h|ment, &s;everal &s;ets of rules were drawn up for the bet|ter regulating of our own Ho&s;pitals, and particularly for a&s;certaining, and enforcing the duties of the Sur|geons, the Mates, the Apothecaries, the Stewa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">s, the Matron and Nur&s;es, the Waiters and Attendants; and al&s;o rules for the ob&s;ervance of the Patients. It would protract this piece, to too great a length, were I to in|&s;ert them here: I therefore content my&s;elf, with taking notice, that the perfecting them was a work of time and of mature reflexion, which would do no di&s;credit to any of the gentlemen that were concerned in the performance, were I to publi&s;h them at large. And I mu&s;t, to do ju&s;tice to this ta&s;k enjoined them, which was &s;ubmitted to my own corrections, ob&s;erve, that it was the means of introducing that exactitude in duty, and that better oeconomy and di&s;cipline into the Ge|neral Ho&s;pital, that were wanted, as might be naturally expected; by means of which, all the proper bu&s;ine&s;s of the Ho&s;pital was afterwards conducted with more regularity, ea&s;e and &s;atisfaction to the officers, and greater benefit and advantages to the patients; all which were much wanted, in all the tran&s;actions I have ever had with the Regimental Surgeons.</P>
<P>This I thought a proper employment for a Director General, and de&s;erving the attention of the Congre&s;s and Commander in Chief. I therefore di&s;patched them to the General, by return of one of his &s;ervants, &s;ent to engage me to come to Head-Quarters, for his peru|&s;al at fir&s;t, and then to be forwarded to Congre&s;s; hoping he would be plea&s;ed to &s;econd my letter to Con|gre&s;s, with &s;ome repre&s;entation from him&s;elf, of the nece&s;&s;ity of adopting the&s;e, or &s;ome other regulation&s;
<PB N="77" REF="015447_0062_0F9982A77106CFD0">
to an&s;wer the intention, for which the&s;e papers might &s;erve as a proper foundation on which to proceed. They were accompanied with a note to Colonel Reed the Adjutant-General, in which I wrote as follows:</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I imagine the annexed regulations, &amp;c. for the e&s;tabli&s;hment, management and &s;upplies of the Regi|mental Ho&s;pitals, will be of great u&s;e in the army, and tend to remove the frequent complaints of Regimental Surgeons, re&s;pecting the want of &s;ome better provi|&s;ion for the &s;ick under their care, and enable them to di&s;charge their duty with more CHEARFULNESS, and ADVANTAGE to the &s;ervice.</P>
<P>They are &s;ubmitted with the Memorial &amp;c. to Con|gre&s;s, to General Wa&s;hington's peru&s;al, if he has time to con&s;ider them, for his approbation. It will appear on reading them, that tho&s;e, or &s;ome &s;uch regulations, are much wanted, and cannot take place, unle&s;s they have his &s;anction in General Orders.</P>
<P>Perhaps you may have &s;o much lei&s;ure as to examine the &s;everal enclo&s;ed papers, and communicate the &s;ub|&s;tance of them to the General, if he is not &s;ufficiently di&s;engaged to look over them, him&s;elf. I intend, agreeeable to your de&s;ire, to be at Head-Quarters early, to come at two o'clock, that there may be &s;ome time for conver&s;ing on this &s;ubject, before dinner."</P>
</LETTER>
<P>I reque&s;ted, that after the General had &s;atisfied him|&s;elf in re&s;pect to the contents of the&s;e papers, they might be forwarded with his di&s;patches to Congre&s;s.</P>
<P>WHEN next I had an opportunity of &s;peaking with the General and &s;uppo&s;ed he might have acquainted him&s;elf with the purport and de&s;ign of tho&s;e papers, I took the liberty of a&s;king his opinion of them. He had been greatly hurried, as I could perceive by the number of applicants to him&s;elf, on a variety of bu&s;i|ne&s;s
<PB N="78" REF="015447_0063_0F9982A82AD0EC18">
of different departments. His an&s;wer, therefore, was &s;uch as might be expected, couched in the follow|ing interrogatory: How can you think, I have time to read over &s;uch a bundle of papers? I told him I was &s;en&s;ible of his &s;ituation, and how precious his time was; that the rea&s;on of my troubling him with &s;o much writing, was that he might not be interrupted by long con&s;ultations, though on the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary matters; but be able to make him&s;elf ma&s;ter of the &s;ubject, when mo&s;t at lei&s;ure to con&s;ider it, with the means be|fore him: I informed him as briefly as po&s;&s;ible, of the general contents, and what I had written to the Adju|tant General, in who&s;e abilities he placed great confi|dence; and concluded with a reque&s;t, that if he &s;hould not have lei&s;ure &s;hortly, to read them over him&s;elf, that he would refer them to Colonel Reed, or any other per&s;on he cho&s;e, to give him an account of them, that &s;ome orders might i&s;&s;ue in con&s;equence: They related to important matters, and nothing could be done in them, without his orders, on which he let me know, that I &s;hould hear from him &s;oon, on the bu&s;ine&s;s they were intended to recommend to his notice.</P>
<P>I think it was that very day, the re&s;olves of Con|gre&s;s, July 17th, came to hand, and were communicated to me, of which I obtained a certified copy from the Adjutant-General, and another, about four days after|wards from Colonel Robert H. Harri&s;on, Secretary to the General, which bears date July 26, 1776.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the Regimental Surgeons, who were impatient to know the General's mind, that they might take their mea&s;ures accordingly, for making a per&s;onal application to him&s;elf, which they judged would an&s;wer as well as applying to Congre&s;s; or for forwarding the memorial and petition to Congre&s;s, as might appear mo&s;t &s;uitable, on knowing his mind; were made acquainted with the beforementioned re&s;olves. The&s;e re&s;olves produced a general di&s;gu&s;t in the Regi|mental Surgeons, as they anticipated, and might pre|vent
<PB N="79" REF="015447_0063_0F9982A82AD0EC18">
the &s;ucce&s;s of any application to Congre&s;s at that time; and cut them off from all pre&s;ent hopes of car|rying into execution, their favourite &s;cheme of having Regimental Ho&s;pitals under their own management, furni&s;hed and &s;upplied to their wi&s;hes; and from the expectation of handling public monies</P>
<P>The chagrin and bitterne&s;s of &s;pirit which they ma|nife&s;ted on this occa&s;ion, is inexpre&s;&s;ible; and every mean artifice that could be devi&s;ed, was carried into execution by &s;ome of them, to counteract, and, if po&s;|&s;ible, to evade tho&s;e re&s;olves. They gave proof indeed, that, for the infamy of it, de&s;erves to be recorded, to what degrees of weakne&s;s, blindne&s;s and folly, men de&s;titute of the principles of honour and hone&s;ty will be tran&s;ported, by a fal&s;e pride, and the di&s;appointment of &s;ecret and ambitions views, when they prefer the gratification of their own de&s;ires, however unju&s;t, to the intere&s;t of the cau&s;e they are engaged to promote, if oppo&s;ed to each other. But I &s;hall defer giving the particulars, till I have fir&s;t communicated a letter, which with a view to &s;erve tho&s;e ungratefal men all in my power, I wrote to General Wa&s;hington, and is as fol|lows:</P>
<LETTER>
<HEAD>TO HIS EXCELLENCY GENERAL WASHINGTON,</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>New-York,</HI> <DATE><HI>July</HI> 25, 1776.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Congre&s;s having come into a number of re|&s;olves re&s;pecting the General Ho&s;pital, &amp;c I find that one of them, as it now &s;tands, gives great unea&s;i|ne&s;s to the Regimental Surgeons. It is that which pro|hibits them from drawing upon the Ho&s;pital of their department for any &s;tores, except medicines and in&s;tru|ments; and orders, that when any &s;ick per&s;on &s;hall
<PB N="80" REF="015447_0064_0F9982A90B710420">
require other &s;tores, they &s;hall be received into the Ge|neral Ho&s;pital, and the rations of the &s;aid &s;ick per&s;ons be &s;topped, &s;o long as they are in the &s;aid Ho&s;pital.</P>
<P>The Regimental Surgeons &s;eem to think, if this re|&s;olve &s;hould remain as it now &s;tands, without any pallia|tive con&s;truction in favor of &s;upplying the &s;ick under their care, with nece&s;&s;ary articles of diet, &amp;c. (for no provi&s;ion is made by any of the&s;e re&s;olves for changing the diet of the &s;ick, and their rations would be very improper diet.) they have nothing left, but immediate|ly to order the whole of their &s;ick into the General Ho&s;pital. What would be the con&s;equence? In&s;tead of about three hundred, which is the pre&s;ent number of the &s;ick in the General Ho&s;pital, it would imme|diately amount to two thou&s;and or upwards, and the numbers increa&s;e every day. But where we &s;hall get room for them, is the difficulty; and in ca&s;e of an ac|tion, and many per&s;ons being wounded, that difficulty would increa&s;e: The General Ho&s;pital would be crowd|ed, and the Regimental Surgeons, who profe&s;s their ar|dent de&s;ire of being u&s;efully employed, would complain of having nothing to do. But what is the wor&s;t part of it, as the dy&s;entery, and fevers of a putrid kind now prevail; the crowding &s;o many together into the Gene|ral Ho&s;pital, would certainly engender a malignant, pe&s;ti|lential fever, that would threaten the ruin of the army.</P>
<P>The&s;e difficulties, in my opinion, might for the pre|&s;ent, be got over in one of the&s;e two ways, the choice of which is left to your Excellency.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t, is by adopting a &s;et of regulations, drawn up and agreed upon, betwixt the Regimental Surgeons and my&s;elf, (if it met with your Excellency's approba|tion,) and which I laid before your Excellency, a fort|night ago, for your con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>Otherwi&s;e, let the Regimental Surgeons be &s;uffered to keep &s;uch men in their own Regimental Ho&s;pitals, under their own care, who&s;e ca&s;es would endanger the &s;preading of putrid and infectious di&s;tempers Let
<PB N="81" REF="015447_0064_0F9982A90B710420">

I apprehend that matter is fully guarded again&s;t, by the method pointed out by the 6th re&s;olve of Congre&s;s, of July 17, on the &s;ubject of the G. Ho&s;pital. The fir&s;t method would give the greate&s;t &s;a|tisfaction, not only to the Regimental Surgeons, but to the officers, and to the men; and an experiment would be made of the real expence attending Regimental Ho&s;pi|tals, and every cau&s;e, or even &s;hadow of complaint, vani&s;h: It would encourage the &s;oldier in his duty, and if it is found, on trial, &s;ubject to any abu&s;e, I imagine that abu&s;e could be ea&s;ily remedied, by future regulations, or a &s;toppage in the men's pay, at the time of a new enli&s;tment.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent increa&s;e of the &s;ick is a &s;erious matter, and requires a &s;peedy remedy. I regret the calling for your Excellency's attention (for ever &s;o &s;hort a time) to my department; but, I flatter my&s;elf, the importance of the &s;ubject, and the advantages which may accrue to the &s;ervice from it, will evince the nece&s;&s;ity, and be a &s;ufficient apology for it.</P>

ANY man of the lea&s;t knowledge of the world, that reflects ever &s;o little, will readily own, how di&s;a|greeable a piece of bu&s;ine&s;s it mu&s;t be, for any gentle|man, to break in upon a Commander in Chief, circum|&s;tanced as General WASHINGTON was, with &s;o great a burden of managing an army of undi&s;ciplined men, in which the nature and extent of the various departments were &s;o un&s;ettled, and &s;o few officers knew their duty, and therefore teized with numberle&s;s applications, which mu&s;t make him, at times, un|avoidably, more difficult of acce&s;s; and to importune him repeatedly on bu&s;ine&s;s, which is &s;uppo&s;ed to be already &s;ettled, either by his own orders, or tho&s;e of Congre&s;s, mu&s;t be very irk&s;ome.</P>
<P>After reading the foregoing letter, can there be a per&s;on found, who will not allow that I exerted my&s;elf to the very utmo&s;t in favour of the Regiment|al Surgeons, to &s;erve them to the extent of my abi|lity; and after tho&s;e repeated exertions, and &s;teady per&s;everance at all times, to promote their rea&s;onable wi&s;hes, as far as was con&s;i&s;tent with my duty, even in oppo&s;ition to the &s;entiments of the General and Con|gre&s;s, when theirs did not agree with my own &s;enti|ments; was not the ingratitude and wickedne&s;s of tho&s;e Regimental Surgeons of the deepe&s;t dye; becau&s;e I would not &s;acrifice to their importunate craving, the duty of my &s;tation, and the tru&s;t repo&s;ed in me, as well as the com|mands of my &s;uperiors; to be guilty, as they were, of private cabals and &s;ecret con&s;piracies, (of which I have lately received full proof,) to injure my cha|racter and mi&s;repre&s;ent my conduct, with a view, if po&s;&s;ible, to ruin me, for ever, in the public e&s;teem?</P>
<P>THAT none may imagine I wi&s;hed to reduce the Regimental Surgeons to any improper dependence on my&s;elf, which might be a&s;&s;igned as a rea&s;on for their oppo&s;ition to me, I think fit to declare, that I never

&s;ought for any authority over them, incon&s;i&s;tent with their true intere&s;t, or upon any occa&s;ion, that I was not compelled to a&s;&s;ume. On the contrary, I declined tho&s;e occa&s;ions that frequently offered, of making them more dependent upon me, than I knew would be agreea|ble to them&s;elves, ever &s;ince they had taken exceptions to the General's public order at Cambridge, that no Regimental Surgeons &s;hould receive commi&s;&s;ions in the army to be rai&s;ed, for the time to come, till they had &s;ubmitted to &s;uch examination of their abilities, as I thought nece&s;&s;ary; and had found means to evade it, by prevailing with their Colonels, who (I have been informed) had blank commi&s;&s;ions by them, to fill them up with the names of the former Surgeons, without any regard to that order. Yet if I had ever made any repre&s;entation of this matter to the General, I am con|vinced, he would not have &s;uffered his own orders to have been di&s;pen&s;ed with, in &s;o extraordinary a man|ner. So far was he from de&s;iring to enlarge their pow|ers, or to le&s;&s;en my authority, that he was plea&s;ed to propo&s;e it to me, him&s;elf, in one of the la&s;t confer|ences, I had with him, on the &s;ubject of regulating the Regimental Surgeons, in order to make them more ab&s;olutely dependent upon me, that they &s;hould receive warrants at my hands only, for acting in that &s;tation. This propo&s;al I declined, on purpo&s;e to avoid the envy that would attend &s;o much power, and the con&s;equent mi&s;con&s;tructions that, I was confident, would be pa&s;&s;ed on the mo&s;t perfect and upright u&s;e, that any man, in my po&s;t, could make of it. I was de&s;irous to avoid giving room for jealou&s;ies to a &s;et of men, of &s;uch tur|bulent and refractory tempers, as I di&s;covered &s;ome of them to be, and of which I experienced the ill effects in the in&s;tances I have already, and am further to re|late, of Mr. Story.</P>
<P>He once called upon me, on bu&s;ine&s;s of Colonel Little's Regiment, &s;oon after my arrival from Cam|bridge
<PB N="84" REF="015447_0066_0F9982B1B5D9C058">
to New-York, when I had not yet laid a&s;ide all thoughts of fini&s;hing the ta&s;k began at Cambridge, on the general's order, to examine the Regimental Sur|geons, with a view to confirm tho&s;e who were qualified for the office, and to report &s;uch as were deficient in education, or abilities. He had been previou&s;ly re|pre&s;ented to me, as a mere firebrand; and as one that was not thought to be properly qualified for a Sur|geon's place; whether ju&s;tly, or not, I &s;hall not pre|&s;ume to &s;ay, as I never proceeded to any examination of his abilities. I a&s;ked him whether he acted as Sur|geon to that Regiment: He told me that he did. On reminding him of the General's order, for examining the Regimental Surgeons, he behaved in a very in&s;o|lent, and impertinent manner, giving me to know, "that he had his commi&s;&s;ion already, no thanks to me, which was as valid, and of as good authority as my own, and that, truly, he never would &s;ubmit to any examination of mine."</P>
<P>Had I been di&s;po&s;ed to treat him, as he merited on that occa&s;ion, I imagine he would have found that I could ea&s;ily have obliged him to it, or to quit the &s;er|vice: But peace was my object. This made me pa&s;s over his pre&s;ent rudene&s;s of behaviour; and encourag|ed him in tho&s;e &s;ub&s;equent acts of in&s;olence, and di&s;|honourable conduct which, I believe, took their ri&s;e from the above cau&s;e; and if he was not always at the bot|tom, yet he always &s;hewed him&s;elf to be one of the mo&s;t violent agitators, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">omentors of di&s;turbances, that I have ever met with.</P>
<P>If I may be allowed to mention, in this place, what I take to be the true cau&s;es of the malevolence of the Re|gimental Surgeons again&s;t me; they were 1&s;t, my di&s;al|lowing them to draw &s;tores, at plea&s;ure, from the G. Ho&s;|pital; 2dly, my having recommended it to the General to require &s;ome proof of the qualifications of tho&s;e men, who were to be entru&s;ted with the lives of the &s;ick and wound|ed &s;oldiery, for which many of them were con&s;cious of
<PB N="85" REF="015447_0066_0F9982B1B5D9C058">
their being found unequal to the ta&s;k, if they were obliged to &s;ubmit to the inquiry; and 3dly, it was a received opinion of theirs, that the re&s;olve of Congre&s;s, "that the Ho&s;pital Surgeons and Mates &s;hould take rank of the Regimental Surgeons and Mates," was owing to me.</P>
<P>The&s;e were unpardonable &s;ins, which they were deter|mined never to forgive nor forget. From the day the&s;e la&s;t re&s;olutions of Congre&s;s were known, they left no &s;cheme untryed to injure my character, and mi&s;repre&s;ent my conduct Of this I have had the &s;tronge&s;t a&s;&s;urances from &s;ome gentlemen, who, &s;ince my di&s;mi&s;&s;ion, and not before, have informed me of their having received application from tho&s;e men to join them in their cabals and con&s;piracy again&s;t me; who were &s;truck with a|&s;toni&s;hment at the propo&s;al, and from the re&s;pect which, they were plea&s;ed to &s;ay, they entertained for my cha|racter and conduct, endeavoured to di&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">wade them from their wicked purpo&s;es, and to convince them that I had &s;hewn, in a very &s;triking manner, my inclination to &s;erve them, in the memorial and propo&s;als I had drawn up for that purpo&s;e, and the letters I had written to Congre&s;s and the General, in their favour; but being bound to act agreeable to my orders, it was not in my power to &s;werve from them. It was the hope of having prevailed with them, by the&s;e remon&s;trances, to lay a&s;ide their intentions, and their cea&s;ing to importune them further on the &s;ubject, that inclined them to make no mention of this affair to me, till they after|wards learned they had, though &s;ecretly, put their de|&s;igns into execution, with a &s;ucce&s;s that amazed them.</P>
<P>The acts they pur&s;ued to fru&s;trate the intentions of Congre&s;s, and to force me to a compliance with their mea&s;ures; were fir&s;t, a neglect of reporting the &s;ick for admi&s;&s;ion into the General-Ho&s;pital; the next was their leaving their proper po&s;ts with their re&s;pective Regi|ments, and carrying the &s;ick to a di&s;tance from the army, where they &s;uffered much, and a&s;cribed all the ill effects of their mi&s;conduct, to my not receding from the re|&s;olutions
<PB N="86" REF="015447_0067_0F9982B3B9D04718">
of Congre&s;s: And again, their infu&s;ing jea|lou&s;ies and groundle&s;s &s;u&s;picions into &s;uch officers as they could influence by their repre&s;entations, and at|tempting, by that means, to mi&s;lead the General Offi|cers and Members of Congre&s;s, to my prejudice. Whatever mi&s;chances happened to the &s;ick from their own perver&s;ene&s;s, or ignorance, were laid by them at my door, as one &s;o wedded to his own plan, as not to yield to the united voice of all the Regimental Sur|geons, to come into their mea&s;ures. And, true it is, my per&s;everance in what I conceived to be my duty, and for the good of the &s;ervice, was un&s;haken; nor could any con&s;ideration induce me to deviate from the commands of my &s;uperiors; although, had the Con|gre&s;s &s;een fit to alter their re&s;olves, in &s;ome particu|lars, I &s;hould have thought it would have been for the better, as my letters fully prove.</P>
<P>I am now led, in the order of events, to lay before the public, &s;ome &s;pecimens of the wickedne&s;s of that &s;et of men, in counterfeiting, caballing, and endeavouring to make impre&s;&s;ions upon General Officers and others, in their favour, and to my prejudice.</P>
<P>And fir&s;t, as to their actor counterfeiting, and pa&s;&s;ing what they had counterfeited as a re&s;olve of Congre&s;s.</P>
<P>Having already mentioned the chagrin and bitterne&s;s of &s;pirit, which many of them di&s;covered, on knowing the re&s;olves of Congre&s;s, July 17; which cut off all their immediate hopes to effect their favorite &s;cheme of having Regimental Ho&s;pitals allowed them, on &s;uch a footing, as to enable them to accumulate &s;tores at plea&s;ure, and to give them &s;ome di&s;po&s;al or public mo|nies; it is to be remarked, that what compleated their chagrin was, the determination of Congre&s;s, which had before rai&s;ed the pay of them&s;elves and Mates, to increa&s;e that of the Ho&s;pital Surgeons and Mates, which was always more than theirs, in &s;uch proportion as they thought proper; but what above all things kindled their malice and re&s;entment was, that the Congre&s;s, in
<PB N="87" REF="015447_0067_0F9982B3B9D04718">
the &s;ame vote, had al&s;o re&s;olved, that the Ho&s;pital Sur|geons and Mates &s;hould take rank of Regimental Sur|geons and Mates, as beforementioned, &s;ee page 29.</P>
<P>Let it be remembered, then, to the perpetual infamy of the mean &s;candalous &s;et who were guilty of it, that upon my furni&s;hing them with a copy of tho&s;e re|&s;olves, for the information of all the Surgeons in the army, they made an alteration in the copy of the eighth re&s;olve, by leaving out the particle <HI>of,</HI> and &s;ub&s;tituting the word <HI>with</HI> in its place, which made an entire change of the meaning of that re&s;olve, into another of an oppo&s;ite &s;ignification, thus foi&s;ting in a brat of their own begetting, to u&s;urp the authority of a vote of Congre&s;s, they di&s;covered what their &s;ecret machi|nations tended to continually, as if this &s;illy device could &s;erve the purpo&s;e of their wi&s;hes, to lower the e&s;timation of the General-Ho&s;pital, and rai&s;e them|&s;elves into imaginary con&s;equence.</P>
<P>After pa&s;&s;ing this counterfeit re&s;olve, and circulat|ing it bri&s;kly, two of their champions, the famous Doctor Story, and an a&s;&s;ociate of his, with a view to in&s;ult the gentlemen of the Ho&s;pital, went about, ex|ulting in imaginary triumph, to vent their reproachful language again&s;t them, and thereby had nearly accom|pli&s;hed what they were intent upon; which was, to make their &s;ituation &s;o di&s;agreeable, notwith&s;tanding they never interfered with them, as to induce them ra|ther to quit a &s;tation that was rendered &s;o irk&s;ome by them, rather than be &s;ubject to &s;uch in&s;olence of con|duct. One of tho&s;e gentlemen was Doctor Warren, (brother to the decea&s;ed General Warren,) a gentle|man, who was &s;o happy, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> gain the e&s;teem of all who knew him, by his under&s;tanding his humanity, his affable and polite behaviour, and his great a&s;&s;iduity and attention to di&s;charge the duties of his &s;tation: He was at that time acting in the place of a Director of the Military Ho&s;pitals at Long-I&s;land, (where, among others, Colonel Little's Regiment was po&s;ted,) with the
<PB N="88" REF="015447_0068_0F9982B42876C7A8">
title and pay only of Surgeon in the General Ho&s;pital, in which he had given great &s;atisfaction to General Green, and every officer of rank at Long-I&s;land, who always &s;poke of him, to me, in high terms of appro|bation. On which, it may not be ami&s;s, tran&s;iently, to con&s;ider this, as a full proof how &s;alutary tho&s;e orders were, which I had given, for providing for the relief and comfortable accommodations of the &s;ick at Long-I&s;land, as well as the efficacy with which they were car|ried into execution, by the wi&s;dom and prudence of the officer who managed the Ho&s;pital department there, by my in&s;tructions.</P>
<P>Di&s;appointed in their malicious de&s;igns, in the fir&s;t, they de&s;i&s;ted not from other, attempts, to perplex the officers of the General Ho&s;pital; and till their aims were accompli&s;hed, a party of them determined to leave nothing undone, which they could have hopes of effecting, to produce a prevailing unea&s;ine&s;s and di&s;|content in the General Ho&s;pital.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of my letter to General Wa&s;hing|ton, of July 25th, in favour of the Regimental Sur|geons, the Adjutant-General called upon me, by his Excellency's command, to con&s;ider how far theirs and my reque&s;t could be granted, con&s;i&s;tently with the in|tention of Congre&s;s, without &s;etting a&s;ide their re|&s;olves. On which, &s;uch General Orders were i&s;&s;ued out July 28, as I thought would afford them &s;ome &s;a|tisfaction, if the good of the &s;ervice was what they had in view, and not their own private advantage and emolument. But I was greatly mi&s;taken in this &s;up|po&s;ition: They were allowed Regimental Ho&s;pitals under certain re&s;trictions; among&s;t which one was, a power given me to &s;end Ho&s;pital Surgeons to vi&s;it their Ho&s;pitals, to prevent crowding them, and keeping more &s;ick on hand, than they could take good care of, who were to be judges what patients were proper objects for, and directed to receive them into the General Ho&s;pital.</P>
<P>They clamoured exceedingly, drew up an appli|cation
<PB N="89" REF="015447_0068_0F9982B42876C7A8">
to the General on that head, which was laid be|fore a Council of General Officers; and &s;ome farther points given up to them, by a General order of Augu&s;t the third. The in&s;olence of a party of the Regiment|al Surgeons ro&s;e, in proportion, as they were gratified in any conce&s;&s;ions made to them, by the officers of the Ho&s;pital, for the &s;ake of peace; who never vi&s;ited their &s;ick, on that account, but &s;ubmitted to receive them, as they &s;aw fit to report, and &s;end them to the General Ho&s;pital, rather than give room for &s;uppo&s;ing they had any contention with the Regimental Surgeons: In truth they had not; unle&s;s the fire which was kept up, on one &s;ide only, by a factious part of the Regi|mental Surgeons, could be called a contention, and to the keeping up of which, the Ho&s;pital Surgeons only contributed by their patience, and &s;uffering for a while, for the good of the &s;ervice, tho&s;e men to &s;port them|&s;elves, without interruption, in their unrea&s;onable pur|&s;uits, or by oppo&s;ing them only, with gentle remon|&s;trances. If this is contention, it is of that &s;ort of which Juvenal, in his &s;atyr, gives a lively de&s;cription. "<HI>ubi tu <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">as, ego vapulo tantum,</HI>" or in which one &s;ide re|ceives, and the other gives all the blows.</P>
<P>At length, the &s;en&s;e of what was due to them&s;elves wrought &s;o far upon the two elde&s;t of the Ho&s;pital Surgeons, Dr. Fo&s;ter and Dr. Warren, who princi|pally experienced the in&s;olence of tho&s;e men; that, be|ing unwilling to endure it further, and equally un|willing to be concerned in any di&s;putes with them, they cho&s;e rather to quit their pre&s;ent &s;tations: The former let me know his intention to leave the &s;ervice; and the latter, in a genteel, manly and &s;en&s;ible letter, made known to me his &s;ituation, and the re&s;olutions into which this conduct of theirs, had forced him: He repre&s;ented to me, what he had experienced from the rude and ungovernable temper of this &s;et of men; that, not content with the determination of Congre&s;s and the General orders re&s;pecting them, they
<PB N="90" REF="015447_0069_0F9982B4E4C91D40">
were ever re&s;tle&s;s, and ever making new and unautho|rized demands, incon&s;i&s;tent with the peace and good government of the General Ho&s;pital; that they were &s;eeking continual occa&s;ions for di&s;pute and differences; and as they found the gentlemen of the Ho&s;pital did not chu&s;e, on every occa&s;ion, which they knew how to call forth for matter of di&s;putation, to trouble either me or them&s;elves with frequent references of their di&s;putes, they would gradually gain one point after another, till all their ends were, at la&s;t an&s;wered, in the &s;ubver&s;ion and ruin of the General Ho&s;pital. In this &s;ituation, as there were daily expectations of the enemys landing at Long-I&s;land he flattered him&s;elf, he could be more u&s;eful in the military, than in the ho&s;pi|tal department, thus circum&s;tanced; and reque&s;ted my permi&s;&s;ion, that he might re&s;ign his place in the General Ho&s;pital, and be allowed to act as a volun|teer, upon the approaching action.</P>
<P>To have been deprived of the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of tho&s;e gentlemen, at &s;o critical a time, who&s;e places I could not have &s;upplied, with others of equal experience in the conducting of Military Ho&s;pitals, on the plan of the Congre&s;s, would have thrown the department into that confu&s;ion, which a de&s;igning party were bu&s;y to excite, in hopes, by fi&s;hing in troubled waters, to de|rive tho&s;e advantages to them&s;elves, in the accom|pli&s;hment whereof, their wi&s;hes &s;eemed to center. By explaining to the gentlemen of the Ho&s;pital, the mi&s;|take into which this perver&s;e conduct of the party had led them, and by &s;upporting their authority, in a proper manner, on every occa&s;ion, they were con|tented to continue in their &s;tations.</P>
<P>The next mea&s;ures tho&s;e men cho&s;e to take, as I have &s;ince learned, from information that I can depend upon, was to intere&s;t &s;uch officers, over whom they had, or could acquire any influence, to make repre|&s;entations in their behalf, to Members of Congre&s;s,
<PB N="91" REF="015447_0069_0F9982B4E4C91D40">
and to the General. I have cau&s;e to believe this was often done to the former, without my having the lea&s;t intelligence of their proceedings: Of cour&s;e, I had it not in my power to explain matters, that ought to be known, or to obviate objections, however ill &s;ounded. I mu&s;t, in ju&s;tice to the General, acknowledge, I have no &s;u&s;picion that his Excellency ever &s;uffered me to re|main long ignorant of any repre&s;entations, that were made to impeach my conduct by which I was, in all the in&s;tances I knew, enabled to an&s;wer in my ju&s;tifi|cation to him, and I hope &s;atisfactorily. But I cannot &s;ay &s;o of the Congre&s;s; for, &s;o far from giving me any information of any &s;uch tran&s;action, the Members of whom I have made enquiry, carefully evaded it: Of which I &s;hall have occa&s;ion to make more particular mention, in its proper place.</P>
<P>The repre&s;entations, in favour of Regimental Sur|geons, which were calculated to injure me; be&s;ides dwelling on the di&s;&s;atisfaction which the Regimental Surgeons had infu&s;ed into many of their men, on groundle&s;s pretences, and which made &s;ome, who knew nothing of the General Ho&s;pital them&s;elves, expre&s;s their di&s;like again&s;t being &s;ent to it; commonly &s;et forth, that it would be highly prejudicial to the &s;ervice, when a new army was to be rai&s;ed;&mdash;that the &s;ick could not be comfortably accommodated in Regimental Ho&s;|pitals. The fact is, many of the officers had been cho&s;en, as it were, by the men, who had not a regard to, or any con&s;ideration of merit, in that choice, or any love of di&s;cipline, but were attached to the per&s;ons of the officers they cho&s;e, in proportion to the knowledge they had of their being <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">en of the &s;ame mean, &s;ordid, grovelling di&s;po&s;ition, with many of them&s;elves; void of the &s;entiments of brave &s;oldiers, love of honour and of liberty on principle, but ready to a&s;&s;ociate with them on a footing of equality; who would drink drams with them, allow them to plunder, or exempt them from duty, when they did not feel them&s;elves, "<HI>bold to fight,</HI>"
<PB N="92" REF="015447_0070_0F9982B602053258">
and who had no objection to fill the army with malig|nerers, public extortioners and cowards.</P>
<P>Here a &s;hocking group of di&s;agreeable facts pre&s;ent to my remembrance in reflecting upon the expedients that have been made u&s;e of to rai&s;e troops, and the &s;hameful con&s;equences. It is a fact, I believe too ge|nerally known to be di&s;puted, that in order to engage men to enter more readily into the &s;ervice, officers com|mi&s;&s;ions were allowed to men, who&s;e ranks were to be determined by the number of levies they could rai&s;e. Prudence, courage, conduct, education experience, ta|lents, or fitne&s;s to command, were not the requi&s;ites for officers. No wonder, then, that &s;uch kind of men were cho&s;en officers, as many of them were; men of the meane&s;t figure and capacity, &s;uch as they termed civil fellows, but in &s;trictne&s;s of meaning. Major Sturgeons, or errant Jerry Sneaks with no&s;es of wax, &s;o very pli|ant as to be governed by the privates, and many of tho&s;e, if we may judge of cau&s;es by effects, had little in view by entering the &s;ervice but to make money, by fa&s;|tening them&s;elves, as leeches, on every thing, from which they could draw pelf. And therefore it was no unu|&s;ual thing, as I have been often told, when a company was forming for the men to chu&s;e tho&s;e, from among&s;t them&s;elves, for officers, who con&s;ented to throw their pay into joint &s;tock with the privates, from which, com|mi&s;&s;ioned and non-commi&s;&s;ioned officers; Captains, Lieutenants, En&s;igns, S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">jean<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s and Corporals, with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> and privates, drew equal &s;hares. Some of tho&s;e, who con&s;ented to be privates for one &s;ix weeks, three months, or &s;ix months, as it happened, expect|ing to have their turn to command, on a new enli&s;t|ment, and perhaps to command tho&s;e very men who were now their officers.</P>

one in&s;tance, out of many. At the approach of an ad|vanced party of the Briti&s;h troops, after the landing at York I&s;land, about three hundred of the men, who were advantageou&s;ly &s;tationed for oppo&s;ing them, re|treated, without giving fire, with great precipitation; or, in common language, ran-away: They were met by Glover's Regiment, which &s;topped their flight: As was no unu&s;ual thing, on being charged with cowardice, the common men ca&s;t the reproach from them&s;elves on their officers, declaring it to be their faults, who, in&s;tead of putting them&s;elves at the head of the men, and leading them on to the attack, or there &s;u&s;taining the charge like &s;oldiers, were the fir&s;t to &s;camper off, leaving their company, to fly to &s;uch places of &s;afety as they could. The officers of Colonel Glover's regiment, one of the be&s;t corps's in the &s;ervice, and who were indeed gentle|men, immediately obliged the fugitive officers and &s;ol|diers, equally, to turn into the ranks with the &s;oldiers of Glover's regiment, and obliged the trembling wretch|es, to march back to the ground they had quitted. I have been an eye-witne&s;s, my&s;elf, to whole battalions running off from Powle's-Hook, and the heights of Bergen, upon the firing of a broad &s;ide from a man of war, in her &s;ailing down the North River to join the fleet below, when obliged to remove from her &s;tation, to avoid a fire-&s;hip, although not a man was hurt by that fire. The&s;e doughty champions never &s;topped till they came to Second River, but forced away the very waggons that were impre&s;&s;ed to tran&s;port the &s;ick, and tho&s;e wounded at Long-I&s;land, to Newark; to carry off them&s;elves and baggage, for many of them cho&s;e to ride, to &s;ave their legs, in ca&s;e of being more nearly pur&s;ued. A cannon being planted in the cau&s;eway, that commanded the ferry at Second River, was point|ed towards them, by an officer of artillery, who com|manded there; and who threatened to mow them down, if they did not return to their po&s;ts. What was their next &s;hift? They betook them&s;elves to a ferry a mile

above: The boats happened to be on the other &s;ide, but within reach of their &s;hot; on which, being fear|ful of any delay, they called out to the ferrymen to ha&s;ten over with their boats, or they would di&s;charge a volley upon them; and thus, they made good their retreat!</P>
<P>When &s;uch were the officers, is it to be wondered at, or rather is it to be believed? But how incredible &s;oever it may appear to tho&s;e at a di&s;tance, it is an in|di&s;putable truth, that a Captain was tried and broke, by a Court-Martial, for &s;tealing his &s;oldiers blankets, the minutes of which Court-Martial are not only publi&s;h|ed among&s;t our&s;elves, but reprinted in the New-York or Newport papers; and one officer, in the face of the General's family, and many officers of di&s;tinction, was found &s;having his men, acting in &s;o menial a capacity, long after the retreats from Long-I&s;land and New-York, whether for the pence he could collect, or that he might &s;tand a chance of intere&s;t and preferment, and "<HI>that he might not be prejudicial to the &s;ervice, when a new army was to be rai&s;ed,</HI>" let ca&s;ui&s;ts determine. Whether giving ear to the unrea&s;onable clamours of &s;uch men as the&s;e, and the gratifying them, by indul|gences in their &s;en&s;ele&s;s demands, di&s;mi&s;&s;ing an officer of di&s;tingui&s;hed rank and tru&s;t, for non-compliance with them, again&s;t the expre&s;s commands of Congre&s;s, was the mo&s;t likely means of promoting the &s;ervice, or procuring re&s;pect and veneration for the Congre&s;s it|&s;elf, time will manife&s;t, <HI>credat Judaeus, non ego.</HI></P>

I was pre&s;ent when a lady from We&s;t-Che&s;ter, lodg|ed a complaint with a General Officer, again&s;t a Captain of the regiment of artificers, who had got into her hou&s;e, and under pretence of protecting her, as a friend, from the incur&s;ions of the enemy, robbed her of a trunk, containing many co&s;tly articles; &s;ilks and other wearing apparel, to the amount of fourteen hundred pounds; and di&s;po&s;ed of her cloaths at a pub|lic &s;ale, which being proved upon him, he was ju&s;tly ca&s;hiered.</P>

The circum&s;tances of which are well known to &s;ome, who are officers of rank in the army, and of irreproachable honour, to whom, if nece&s;&s;ary, I can appeal, in &s;upport of what I advance.</P>
<P>About the month of Augu&s;t, 1776, having made frequent repre&s;entations at Head-Quarters, that I could not obtain regular reports from the Regimental Sur|geons, of the &s;tate of their &s;ick; but that they were &s;eizing on tho&s;e very hou&s;es for regimental &s;ick, that were a&s;&s;igned to me, by the State of New-York, for the u&s;e of the General Ho&s;pital; an order was i&s;&s;ued, requiring the Regimental Surgeons to deliver in the re|ports I had demanded, &amp;c. and to inforce it, all Colo|nels, and Commanders of Regiments were called upon, to make it known to their Surgeons, that they might not plead ignorance, and were directed to &s;ee that the order was duly ob&s;erved.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t at that time, a Brigade newly arrived from the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay Government, under command of General Fellows, was ordered to be &s;tationed along the river, from Greenwich to Chel&s;ea and upwards, to throw up lines, and defend the &s;ame again&s;t any attempts of the enemy to land there. Mo&s;t of the hou&s;es fit for the accommodation of the officers of that Brigade, and for quartering of the men, being previou&s;ly &s;eized up|on by the Regimental Surgeons, for them&s;elves and their &s;ick; Colonel Moylan, then Quarter-ma&s;ter General, de&s;ired we might ride out together, to take a view of the &s;ick, and of the hou&s;es in that quarter. He order|ed a large dwelling hou&s;e, on the e&s;tate of the decea&s;ed Admiral Warren, then in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of certain Regi|mental &s;ick, to be evacuated, and clean&s;ed for the ac|commodation of the officers of the Brigade, po&s;ted in
<PB N="97" REF="015447_0072_0F9982BBF75D7E10">
the neighbourhood, to whom therefore it was very con|venient, as it adjoined the works thrown up for defence of the landing, but a very improper place to contain &s;ick per&s;ons, as it was clo&s;e to the bank of the river, and particularly expo&s;ed to the firing of the &s;hips, that might pa&s;s up or down the &s;ame.</P>
<P>The very mention of di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the Regimental Surgeons of their Ho&s;pital, gave great di&s;&s;atisfaction, though I undertook to receive their &s;ick into the Gene|ral Ho&s;pital. That propo&s;al met with oppo&s;ition. That the Surgeon might have a place for the accommodation of his patients, I informed him of a large commodious barn of Mr. Campbell's at Greenwich, with two &s;pare rooms on the back part, and lower floor of the hou&s;e, at a &s;mall di&s;tance, adjoining the kitchen, being rooms the be&s;t &s;heltered from the &s;hot of pa&s;&s;ing men of war, and mo&s;t retired from the river. Such &s;pacious, airey barns as the above, well floored, and &s;ecure from rain, yet cool, and pervious to the wind, an&s;wer to the pla|ces, recommended by Sir John Pringle phy&s;ician to the Briti&s;h army, in a former war, as proper for ho&s;pitals. Such, a&s;&s;uredly, are better calculated for the recovery of dy&s;enteric and putrid di&s;ea&s;es, that prevailed at this time, to any of the dwelling hou&s;es, with plai&s;tered walls, and &s;mall or confined chambers, which, though convenient for a private family, are not proper for the crowding of &s;ick into them. But fine hou&s;es were commonly preferred by the Regimental Surgeons; and this gentleman let me know, that he &s;hould expect to be broke, if he con&s;ented to accept of a barn, however commodious, for the reception of his &s;ick.</P>
<P>The hou&s;e it&s;elf, he could not have, it being pre|occupied by another Surgeon, for the u&s;e of a Regi|mental Ho&s;pital. On looking into the rooms, they were found to be filled with the &s;ick, and the Surgeon who had the care, panting for breath, in the mid&s;t of them, It was amid&s;t the &s;ultry heats of &s;ummer: In vain I re|pre&s;ented to him the danger of engendring a putrid <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="98" REF="015447_0073_0F9982BD97D22CD0">
fever, from crowding &s;o many &s;ick, in confined rooms, in that hot &s;ea&s;on. He had near a hundred &s;ick in the hou&s;e: I forbad him then, as I had uniformly prohi|bited every Regimental Surgeon I conver&s;ed with on the &s;ubject, from taking charge of more than thirty or forty &s;ick, on the out&s;ide, at any one time, being a larger number than they could well attend; as I de&s;ir|ed to know how they intended to manage, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> called to the field of battle, or on any &s;udden removal of their regiments, an event daily expected, and they encum|bered with &s;o many &s;ick. As the other Surgeon had refu&s;ed to occupy the barn, and &s;hady rooms on the ground floor, back of the hou&s;e, I recommended it to him, to &s;end at lea&s;t one half of his &s;ick to the Gene|ral Ho&s;pital, and remove the greater part of the men into the barn: He di&s;regarded my advice, a putrid fe|ver prevailed, he caught the infection, and paid the for|feiture of his ra&s;hne&s;s, with his life.</P>
<P>I then went to General Heath, who commanded that divi&s;ion of the army, and repre&s;ented the matter to him; and as it was but a &s;mall di&s;tance from his quar|ters, reque&s;ted him to give him&s;elf the trouble, of &s;ee|ing with his own eyes, and judging him&s;elf of the truth of the facts I related. The General, in polite terms, declined my mo&s;t importunate &s;olicitation, upon this unan&s;werable objection, that it might look, as if he made him&s;elf a party again&s;t the Regimental Surgeons.</P>
<P>As the Surgeon had never made his report, and the order had been i&s;&s;ued a week, I had waited on the Lieutenant-Colonel of the regiment, in per&s;on, before I &s;aw the Surgeon and complained of his neglect, in not reporting his &s;ick, and in not &s;ending &s;uch as exceeded the number he could take care of, to the General Ho&s;|pital. I reminded him that, by the General Order, he was required to &s;ee that the Surgeon complyed with &s;aid order. The an&s;wer he gave me, was in the&s;e very words: "That the Regimental Surgeons could read the orders for them&s;elves; and it not, he &s;hould give him|&s;elf
<PB N="99" REF="015447_0073_0F9982BD97D22CD0">
no trouble about it; adding, that, if it was in his power to prevent it, none of his men &s;hould ever be carried to a General Ho&s;pital."</P>
<P>Perhaps it may be imagined from &s;uch a reply, he had rea&s;on to a&s;&s;ert, that the General Ho&s;pital was not kept in a clean and proper &s;tate, and that the Regi|mental Ho&s;pitals were: The rever&s;e of which was true: The former were always kept clean and airey and, in the words of General Green's letter, which I &s;hall have occa&s;ion to publi&s;h at large, "<HI>well provided with eve|ry thing, and the &s;ick very comfortable;</HI>" whereas mo&s;t of the Regimental Ho&s;pitals, I had ever &s;een, on ac|count of the filth and na&s;tine&s;s of them, de&s;erved the appellation they have acquired in the Ea&s;tern Govern|ments, of pe&s;t-hou&s;es; for &s;uch they commonly turn|ed out to be. I a&s;ked him his rea&s;ons: He made no re|ply to my que&s;tion; but required of me to give him an order, which it &s;eems he thought proper to demand of me, in favour of his Surgeon, for a number of bed frames.</P>
<P>This leads me to &s;hew in what manner the Regiment|al Surgeons and &s;uch officers were ever at work, by their plans, and method of proceeding, to exhau&s;t, unfurni&s;h, or prevent the &s;upplies of the General Ho&s;|pital, all in their power I had engaged the Quarter-ma&s;ter General, to give orders in his department, for making a large number of bed frames, for the &s;ick of the General Ho&s;pital. So fa&s;t as forty or fifty were made, the Regimental Surgeons, with, or without or|ders from their officers, applyed for, and carried them away. Colonel Moylan, told the Officer in my hearing, "that they had carried off above two thou|&s;and, that were intended for the General Ho&s;pital; which of cour&s;e, could not be provided with them as fa&s;t as was wanted." Upon every movement of a regi|ment, that required a &s;hifting of the hou&s;es for Regi|mental Ho&s;pitals, many of the bed frames were left be|hind, or burned, or carried off; and the Surgeons,
<PB N="100" REF="015447_0074_0F9982BDEB0DCE08">
probably, made fre&s;h applications for others, whil&s;t the General Ho&s;pital could not be provided with &s;pare bed&s;teads, for additional &s;ick, or wounded that might be &s;ent in.</P>
<P>On that occa&s;ion, I remon&s;trated in favour of the General Ho&s;pital, and had a &s;top put to the further &s;upplies of bed frames to the Regimental Surgeons, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> was better furni&s;hed Upon this, and in like in|&s;tances, I have been vi&s;ited by &s;ome of the militia Co|lonels and Brigadiers who, by their repre&s;entations, &s;eemed to think it a hard ca&s;e, that I would not concur with their Surgeons and them, to &s;ubvert the General Ho&s;pital, which I was appointed to e&s;tabli&s;h and go|vern; to enable them, contrary to the de&s;igns of Con|gre&s;s the General's Orders, and the very nature of things, to transfer all the property and power of the General Ho&s;pital, to Regimental Surgeons. Colonel Moylan then and often, told me, that by the repeated conce&s;&s;ions I was making to tho&s;e men, he &s;hould not wonder if they &s;ucceeded, in what he &s;aw they were aiming at, to &s;ubvert the General Ho&s;pital, and plant them&s;elves on the ruins, to the confu&s;ion of all order and di&s;cipline.</P>
<P>But to return from this relation, which being con|nected with, and part of the &s;ubject I am upon, is not an improper digre&s;&s;ion, I now re&s;ume the narra|tive of that particular in&s;tance of brutal conduct, which I have had in view, to illu&s;trate my declaration of en|croaching on my department, by an outrage upon all military order and di&s;cipline, and on humanity it&s;elf.</P>
<P>Mr. Campbell, who had purcha&s;ed a lea&s;e of the hou&s;e aforementioned, at Greenwich, from Mr. De|lancey, was a &s;tranger, and with his lady and family of children, of whom he had &s;everal, all young, and &s;ome mere infants, came into America to &s;ettle, about the time our unhappy di&s;putes, with Great Britain, be|gan, or &s;oon after they began to be attended with &s;uch con&s;equences, as civil war and blood&s;hed.

being &s;atisfied that he had not come over to America, with any inimical intention of taking part in the di&s;|pute, again&s;t this country, &s;aw fit, as I am informed, to grant him their protection; on the faith of which he determined to become an American, by &s;ettling here with his family: He cho&s;e the neighbourhood of New-York, for his re&s;idence, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ea&s;ed the hou&s;e, with the e&s;tate, already mentioned, at Greenwich, where he conducted him&s;elf inoffen&s;ively and irreproachably The lu&s;tful eye of &s;ome of the Regimental Officers, or Surgeons, marked it out for a Regimental Ho&s;pital. I had the account from Mr. Campbell's own mouth, with cir|cum&s;tances that gained my credit to his relation: He informed me, that with out any previous notice, to de|part, and re&s;ting on the a&s;&s;urances of the Quarter-ma&s;ter General, that he &s;hould not di&s;place him, (for he &s;aw no occa&s;ion for it;) a gallant officer came up one day to the hou&s;e, followed with a long train of &s;ickly &s;oldiers, who were ill, with dy&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">nt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ys, putrid, and other fevers, and put them in p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;&s;ion of his hou&s;e, without any regard to the owner, or to the circum&s;tances of his family, as if on purpo&s;e to drive them out from their habitation.</P>
<P>This he effected; but not immediately, as Mr. Camp|bell had no other hou&s;e in which he had a right, or that he could hope for liberty, to &s;helter him&s;elf, his wife and helple&s;s children; nor before the&s;e, who were of a delicate frame were &s;eized with the infection, and nearly de&s;troyed by the filth of the &s;ick, which had drove them from room to room, till they had no far|ther retreat.

Of the Regimental Surgeons and Mates, I will only ob&s;erve this once, that as I have done ju&s;tice to tho&s;e of them, who merited it, by declaring there were &s;ome among&s;t them of liberal manners, education and abili|ties; I mu&s;t be permitted to declare, there were many, very many of them, unlettered, ignorant, and rude to a degree &s;carcely to be imagined. Some of them, I have been informed, and from what I ob&s;erved, could readi|ly believe, were never educated to the profe&s;&s;ion of phy&s;ick, nor had ever &s;een an operation of Surgery: Many of them had but &s;mall appearances of either li|terature or breeding, in which re&s;pect they fell &s;hort of &s;ome of the privates.

And that this ignorance was pretty general, may be &s;afely inferred from their repugnance to &s;tand the te&s;t of inquiry, &s;o contrary to the practice of tho&s;e, who are men of talents, improved by education, who &s;hun no occa&s;ion, of giving proof thereof, by their compli|ance with tho&s;e laws and regulations, which the wi&s;|dom of States, or the good policy of &s;eminaries, and corporations of the learned in the profe&s;&s;ion, devi&s;e, to encourage genius and merit, and to put a &s;top to the rapid growth of empyrici&s;m: And I ob&s;erved, that it was generally the mo&s;t ignorant, the mo&s;t opiniated and the mo&s;t di&s;orderly, and irregular in their conduct, who were the mo&s;t trouble&s;ome, and loude&s;t in their cla|mours. The&s;e were the men, from whom I found the greate&s;t oppo&s;ition, to every regulation for introduc|ing method, di&s;cipline and improvement, into the de|partment of phy&s;ick and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">.</P>
<P>It is with much regret I have yielded to the nece&s;&s;ity I have been under, in clearing up my own conduct from the imputations of a &s;et of wicked men, to di&s;|play the true character and behaviour of tho&s;e, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="104" REF="015447_0076_0F9982C070ADD290">
were my accu&s;ers, and from the many &s;amples of ra|pine, di&s;order and oppre&s;&s;ion of which they have been guilty, to &s;elect &s;ome of their nefarious practices, and of &s;uch amazing prodigality, as, if it were allowed to pa&s;s without notice, would have been &s;ufficient to in|&s;ure de&s;truction to any army, or people. I am fully per&s;waded that we owe many of the misfortunes and mi&s;carriages of la&s;t campaign, to tho&s;e men, who were guilty of them. I have but barely &s;kimmed over the &s;urface of them. A reluctance to enter deeper into &s;uch a &s;ink has re&s;trained me: Were I to attempt an enumeration of them all time would fail.</P>
<P>It is &s;ufficient to &s;hew their de&s;tructive tendency, in general; to make a remark on the mean and &s;ordid practice, which was pur&s;ued by &s;ome of the Regiment|al Surgeons, of &s;elling certificates for furloughs and di&s;charges, at a le&s;s &s;um than a &s;hilling a man. At this rate, a number equal to a regiment might be di&s;|charged for a much le&s;s &s;um, than has been &s;ince given, to rai&s;e a &s;ingle recruit. At a moderate computation, &s;o many men have been born on &s;ome &s;ick li&s;ts of Re|gimental Surgeons, including waiters, fit for duty, that if the practice was common, the &s;tronge&s;t Brigade in the army was not equal to the number thus maintained in idlene&s;s. I am willing to hope that tho&s;e in&s;tances of mal-practice I have adduced are &s;ufficient to &s;hut the door again&s;t the like abu&s;es in future, and to introduce better di&s;cipline, and better men into &s;tations of public tru&s;t: And that men of better principle, as well as of more knowledge and humanity, are engaged in the pre&s;ent &s;ervice. To promote the intere&s;ts of the&s;e, were the motives of my conduct, and the object I invariably pur&s;ued in all my propo&s;ed regulations.</P>
<P>Among&s;t tho&s;e in employ the la&s;t year, &s;ome, in the time of need, de&s;erted the army altogether, and others &s;hunned to attend their regiments to the field of battle.</P>
<P>It was a general complaint, that at the battle of
<PB N="105" REF="015447_0076_0F9982C070ADD290">
the White-Plains, few of the Regimental Surgeons were with their re&s;pective Battalions, in con&s;equence of which many of the wounded bled to death, who, it was &s;uppo&s;ed, might have been &s;aved, had they been pre&s;ent, and done their duty: Their ab&s;ence obliged me to fix my&s;elf at the lines, with &s;ome of the Ho&s;pital Sur|geons. This produced the following circular letter to be &s;ent round the country, with orders to the Surgeons of the General Ho&s;pital who were at a di&s;tance from camp, to call upon the Regimental Surgeons, in pur|&s;uance of the re&s;olves of Congre&s;s, and the General's commands, to deliver up all their &s;ick to the Ho&s;pital, and to return to their proper po&s;ts, &s;igned, with the following declaration.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>AMONGST other methods u&s;ed by the Regimental Surgeons, to accompli&s;h their purpo&s;es, I have men|tioned their infu&s;ing jealou&s;ies and groundle&s;s &s;u&s;picions into &s;uch officers as they could influence by their repre|&s;entations,
<PB N="107" REF="015447_0077_0F9982C0EF2A14D8">
in hopes, by their means, to mi&s;lead the Ge|neral Officers, and Members of Congre&s;s, to my pre|judice.</P>
<P>I do not pretend to have knowledge of all the appli|cations that have been made, to different Members of Congre&s;s, to give weight to the clamours of the Regi|mental Surgeons; but one of them, that I do not know of, requires my &s;erious attention.</P>
<P>Having called one day, upon General Green, to con|&s;ult him about &s;ome regulations of the ho&s;pitals, I found him bu&s;y in writing a letter to the Pre&s;ident of Congre&s;s, complaining much of the &s;ufferings of the &s;ick, for want of &s;uch e&s;tabli&s;hment, as provided pro|perly for taking good care of them. Not the lea&s;t no|tice was taken of the unwearied pains I had be&s;towed to accompli&s;h that purpo&s;e; which might lead Con|gre&s;s to imagine me very negligent of my duty, or in|attentive to matters that &s;o nearly concerned me: I told him &s;o: He then added a po&s;t&s;cript, in which he &s;eemed barely to guard again&s;t reflexions upon me; yet forebore to do me that ju&s;tice, which I thought my|&s;elf well entitled to expect from him, if to be had from any man in the army.</P>
<P>I had attended General Green in two dangerous fits of illne&s;s, in which he had proofs of my attention to him, and a&s;&s;iduity to the bu&s;ine&s;s of my &s;tation, that merited a far different return. The la&s;t was at a time, when General Green had the command at Long-I&s;land, and about the time when the enemy were landed not many miles below. Although I was then ince&s;&s;antly engaged on New-York I&s;land, I made all other bu&s;ine&s;s give way to my daily attendance on him; and finding his life en|dangered, by a putrid and billious fever, under which he laboured, prevailed with him to leave the i&s;land, and provided him with one of the mo&s;t healthy, airey, &s;afe&s;t and be&s;t accommodated habitations, in the center, betwixt the two rivers, two miles di&s;tant from the city of New-York. My place of duty changed, likewi&s;e,
<PB N="108" REF="015447_0078_0F9982C1B6446908">
and my pre&s;ence was demanded every day at Long-I&s;land, to attend to the care and removal of the wound|ed. Yet I vi&s;ited him, daily, once, twice or oftner, under a variety of difficulties, and watched over him with the &s;tricte&s;t attention, and an affection little le&s;s than fraternal, till his recovery was &s;o far compleated, that he was out of all danger. I &s;hould not have giv|en this account of matters, but for the following rea|&s;ons: The fir&s;t is, becau&s;e it was at General Green's de&s;ire, I e&s;tabli&s;hed a General Ho&s;pital at Long-I&s;land, for the benefit of that part of the army under his com|mand, which was &s;o well conducted by Doctor War|ren, as to compell him to pa&s;s high encomiums on its management, in a Council of General Officers, held on the complaints made by the Regimental Surgeons, that were found to be groundle&s;s and unrea&s;onable.</P>
<P>If there was any deficiency in either that part of the General Ho&s;pital it&s;elf, or any want in the accommo|dation of the &s;ick of the regiments &s;tationed there, that could be obtained, the fault mu&s;t be laid at his door, and his only, becau&s;e he had expre&s;&s;ly engaged, at my fir&s;t con&s;enting, in compliance with his reque&s;t, to provide a General Ho&s;pital there; to build or fur|ni&s;h &s;ufficient quarters for all the &s;ick belonging to that divi&s;ion of the army under his command; and becau&s;e by my orders to Doctor Warren, my in&s;tructions to the Regimental Surgeons, July 3d, and General Wa&s;h|ington's order, matters were &s;o regulated that the &s;ick might remain under the care of their own Surgeons, in &s;uch quarters or ho&s;pitals as General Green him&s;elf might order for them; and be con&s;idered as parts of one General Ho&s;pital, of which Doctor Warren was to be e&s;teemed the Director and Head: They were to be allowed all nece&s;&s;ary refre&s;hments, and the Regimental Surgeons and their &s;ick might partake of every advan|tage, which the &s;ick in the General Ho&s;pital enjoyed, under the immediate care of the Ho&s;pital Surgeons, if the Regimental Surgeons would con&s;ider them&s;elves as
<PB N="109" REF="015447_0078_0F9982C1B6446908">
acting under the direction of the General Ho&s;pital, with this only re&s;triction, that every demand was to be made, and granted under the acknowledged authority of Doctor Warren, to whom I had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> all my own power for their good, for which he was to be ac|countable: And I forbad him to deliver out any &s;tores, of any kind, to the Regimental Surgeons, for the &s;ick, not reported to, and con&s;idered as in the General Ho&s;|pital.</P>
<P>A &s;econd rea&s;on, is the following letter from Gene|ral Green to General Wa&s;hington, of Augu&s;t 11th.</P>
<P>A third rea&s;on, is my having been cen&s;ured, for de|laying to communicate to the Congre&s;s the plan of re|gulations I had promi&s;ed to draw up for their con&s;ider|ation, &s;o long after I had undertaken it, during all which time it was left with Gen. Green, for the benefit of his ob&s;ervations and remarks, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> from about the mid|dle or end of October to the 20th of December, al|though I repeatedly applied to him by me&s;&s;age and let|ter, to expedite it for that purpo&s;e; and it was then returned to me in the &s;tate I delivered it, without any remark to accompany it.</P>
<P>And la&s;tly, the liberty which Doctor Story took, of making u&s;e of General Green's name, to &s;anctify his a&s;&s;ertions, that the &s;ufferings of the &s;ick lay at my door.</P>
<P>On the&s;e &s;everal accounts, I now call on General Green (in a more e&s;pecial manner) and on any, and every other officer, of whatever rank, whether Gene|ral or Field Officers, or tho&s;e of inferior rank, who have thought fit to make any repre&s;entations, either to Congre&s;s as a body, or to particular Members of it, or to the Commander in Chief, concerning the cau&s;es of the &s;ufferings of the &s;ick, if they can lay any thing to my charge, whether relating to the di&s;po&s;al of Ho&s;pi|tal Stores, the di&s;po&s;ition of public monies, or any other article entru&s;ted to me: I de&s;ire to know if they can accu&s;e me of any neglect of duty, of indo|lence,
<PB N="110" REF="015447_0079_0F9982C28474C710">
inactivity, inattention to the calls of my &s;tation, or of any breach, either of General Orders, or of the Re&s;olves of Congre&s;s: If they can do any of the&s;e, I &s;hall be glad they will publi&s;h it to the world, in a man|ner that will afford me an opportunity to reply, in print. Did ever any General, Field Officer, or other, on any &s;ugge&s;tion of the &s;ick &s;uffering for want of care, vi&s;it the General Ho&s;pital, and judging with his own eyes, report to me a &s;ingle in&s;tance of the &s;ort? I de|clare they never did: So that the complaints of the &s;uf|ferings of the &s;ick, are not of tho&s;e under my care, but of tho&s;e that were hindered from coming, or who were never reported to the General Ho&s;pital, for admi&s;&s;ion. On the contrary, the complaints ever were, that "<HI>whil&s;t in the General Ho&s;pital, the &s;ick were well taken care of, they could not enjoy the like advantages in Regimental Ho&s;pitals,</HI>" But if &s;o, the fault of not &s;ending them to the General Ho&s;pital, is the more con&s;picuous, and the wickedne&s;s of a&s;cribing the &s;ufferings of the &s;ick to the General Ho&s;pital, or my&s;elf, from who&s;e care they were kept back, and which is ju&s;tly chargeable on the Regimental Surgeons, who kept them back, and the officers who &s;upported them in &s;uch a contumacious di&s;obedience of every order, of the Congre&s;s and Ge|neral, is the more flagrant. But, let us attend to Ge|neral Green's letter.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Camp at</HI> Long-I&s;land,<DATE><HI>Aug.</HI> 11, 1776.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>DEAR GENERAL,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THERE is no proper e&s;tabli&s;hment for &s;upplying the Regimental Ho&s;pitals with proper uten&s;ils for the &s;ick; they &s;uffer therefore for want of proper ac|commodation.
<PB N="111" REF="015447_0079_0F9982C28474C710">
There is repeated complaints on that head. The Regimental Ho&s;pitals are, and ever will be rendered u&s;ele&s;s, nay grievous, unle&s;s there is &s;ome proper fund, to provide the nece&s;&s;ary conveniences. The General Ho&s;pital cannot receive all the &s;ick; and tho&s;e that are in the Regimental Ho&s;pitals, are in a &s;uffering condition. If this evil continues, it mu&s;t greatly injure the &s;ervice, as it will di&s;pirit the well, to &s;ee the &s;ick &s;uffer, and prevent their engaging again, up|on any conditions whatever. Great humanity &s;hould be exerci&s;ed, towards tho&s;e indi&s;po&s;ed. Kindne&s;s up|on one hand, leaves a favorable and la&s;ting impre&s;&s;ion, neglect and &s;uffering on the other, is never forgotten.</P>
<P>I am &s;en&s;ible, there has formerly been great abu&s;es in the Regimental Ho&s;pitals, but I am in hopes, men of better principles are elected to tho&s;e places, and that the &s;ame evils will not happen again. But the Conti|nent had better &s;uffer a little extraordinary expence, than the &s;ick &s;hould be left to &s;uffer, for want of tho&s;e conveniences that may be ea&s;ily provided.</P>
<P>I would beg leave to propo&s;e, that the Colonels of regiments be allowed to draw monies, to provide the Regimental Ho&s;pitals, with proper uten&s;ils; an account of the di&s;bur&s;ements weekly, or monthly, to be render|ed: This will prevent abu&s;e, and remedy the evil.</P>
<P>Something is nece&s;&s;ary to be done, &s;peedily, as many &s;ick are in a &s;uffering condition.</P>
<P>The General Ho&s;pital is well provided with every thing, and the &s;ick very comfortable. I wi&s;h it was exten&s;ive enough to receive the whole, but it is not.</P>

<P>I SHALL now take the liberty of propounding a few que&s;tions, on the contents of the above letter.</P>
<P>WAS General Green acquainted with the re&s;olves of
<PB N="112" REF="015447_0080_0F9982C325C4B380">
Congre&s;s, of July 17, page 29? If &s;o, has not his letter a direct tendency to oppo&s;e and over&s;et them?</P>
<P>What rea&s;on can be a&s;&s;igned for Regimental Ho&s;pi|tals being e&s;tabli&s;hed on Long-I&s;land, with all the fur|niture and apparatus of a General Ho&s;pital, when the &s;ick might have the benefit of the General Ho&s;pital there, in compliance with General Green's own re|que&s;t, although a very improper place for e&s;tabli&s;hing an Ho&s;pital, where the enemy were expected to land, e&s;pecially when there was a General Ho&s;pital on the I&s;land of New-York, for the reception of tho&s;e who could not be accommodated at Long-I&s;land?</P>
<P>Of what u&s;e could Regimental Ho&s;pitals be at Long-I&s;land; or rather, with what di&s;&s;ervice mu&s;t they be at|tended, when the enemy were expected to land there? Was it to retain more &s;ick there, to embarra&s;s the ar|my, when the works were be&s;ieged, or to keep Regi|mental Soldiers from accompanying their corps into the field, in ca&s;e it was judged expedient to march forth, to meet the enemy at a di&s;tance, from the lines; or was it convenient, at &s;uch times, to be di&s;charging ma|ny hundreds of &s;ick, in the time of action, upon the Ho&s;pital Surgeons on the I&s;land, at the &s;ame time with the wounded?</P>
<P>It is &s;aid the General Ho&s;pital cannot receive all the &s;ick, and tho&s;e in the Regimental Ho&s;pitals were in a &s;uffering condition. Had any been reported to the Ge|neral Ho&s;pital at Long-I&s;land, that were ever refu&s;ed admi&s;&s;ion? I never heard of an in&s;tance. But if there was no room at Long-I&s;land, was there no room in the General Ho&s;pital at New-York? Would neither the College, with all its &s;pacious apartments; the City Ho&s;pital, with all its great and magnificent conve|niences; the City Barracks, capable of accommodating above a thou&s;and men; the many vacant hou&s;es in the Bowry, or neighbourhood of New-York, and whole &s;treets, appropriated for the purpo&s;e, and a&s;&s;igned to the Director-General, by the Convention of the State
<PB N="113" REF="015447_0080_0F9982C325C4B380">
of New-York, and the City Committee, and to be at his di&s;po&s;al only: I &s;ay, were not all the&s;e &s;ufficient for their reception and accommodation? If not, he had the choice of mo&s;t of the country &s;eats, for the &s;pace of &s;even miles from the city, to an&s;wer that purpo&s;e. And were not the&s;e enough?</P>
<P>But &s;uppo&s;e it to have been nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;ick to be accommodated on Long-I&s;land: What rea&s;on can be a&s;&s;igned, if they were to be permitted to draw &s;tores and furniture from the General Ho&s;pital, why they &s;hould not range them&s;elves under the direction of Doctor Warren, which was the only po&s;&s;ible method, that, with much reflexion, could be devi&s;ed to entitle them to the nece&s;&s;aries and comforts, which it was allowed the General Ho&s;pital was well provided with? Could the Regimental Surgeons, who were &s;o earne&s;t for hav|ing &s;eparate and di&s;tinct Ho&s;pitals, have any thing in view, by remaining unaccountable for their &s;upplies? What other rea&s;on could they have for refu&s;ing to have the &s;tate of their &s;ick in&s;pected by Ho&s;pital Surgeons, with a power to order &s;uch &s;ick, as appeared to be pro|per objects, into the General Ho&s;pital, but to retain as many &s;ick, or nominal &s;ick, as they plea&s;ed, on their li&s;ts, till the time of an action, and then to pour them all into the General Ho&s;pital, and to receive the wounded under their care, for the &s;ake of trying ex|periments, and of performing operations, which &s;ome of them had never &s;een performed? From all their actions, it is plain this was an object they had much at heart. And what would that be, but to reduce Gen|tlemen, of the fir&s;t cla&s;s in their profe&s;&s;ion, to be &s;ubordinate to all their purpo&s;es, and meer mini&s;ters of their plea&s;ure?</P>
<P>For what purpo&s;e are &s;uperior rank and greater pay allowed to Ho&s;pital, than to Regimental Surgeons, if not to engage men of the fir&s;t ability, education, and experience, to take that charge upon them?</P>
<P>And after all, is there any thing propo&s;ed in Gene|ral
<PB N="114" REF="015447_0081_0F9982C41698CE28">
Green's letter, that I had not urged before, both to General Green him&s;elf, as well as to General Wa&s;hing|ton and the Congre&s;s, for the relief of the Regimental Surgeons, who might be &s;ituated at &s;ome di&s;tance from the General Ho&s;pital? Wherefore, if there could be any exception made to the plan, it mu&s;t be to except tho&s;e on Long-I&s;land, where it was unfit there &s;hould be Regimental Ho&s;pitals, when the enemy were expect|ed to land there, and when there was a General Ho&s;pi|tal at hand, of which they might have the &s;ame bene|fits, with tho&s;e under the immediate care of the Ho&s;|pital Surgeons and Mates; if they would &s;ubmit to the &s;ame regulations.</P>
<P>Upon the whole of this inquiry; when the Congre&s;s who, for ought General Green knew to the contrary, might be &s;uppo&s;ed to have weighed matters deliberately, had fixt upon a plan, which, by every &s;ub&s;equent &s;et of re&s;olves, re&s;tricted the Regimental Surgeons, within narrower limits than before; or, at lea&s;t, enforced the former, with new and additional weight: Where was the nece&s;&s;ity, expedience, or propriety, of &s;upporting the Regimental Surgeons in their clamours? They were ever backward to &s;end their &s;ick to the General Ho&s;pi|tal, to have a plea for Regimental Ho&s;pitals, and to draw &s;tores at di&s;cretion, which never was allowed in any army, and which Congre&s;s had not &s;een fit to allow them? Would it not have been more con&s;i&s;tent with the idea of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the commands of our &s;upe|riors, if General Green, in&s;tead of giving that weight to the prejudices, and ignorance in point of duty, and in the proper management of the &s;ick of an army, which the Surgeons laboured under, had &s;een fit to have enjoined their making weekly returns of their &s;ick to the General Ho&s;pital, for admi&s;&s;ion, agreeable to the orders of Congre&s;s; and thereby helped to cure or re|move tho&s;e prejudices? This might have checked them in their career, of a&s;per&s;ing reputations to accompli&s;h
<PB N="115" REF="015447_0081_0F9982C41698CE28">
their aims, and mu&s;t have contributed to their own ea&s;e, and the great benefit of the &s;uffering &s;ick.</P>
<P>But whil&s;t Regimental Surgeons were &s;o intent upon the e&s;tabli&s;hment of Ho&s;pitals for their regiments, and General Green was &s;o earne&s;t in &s;econding their de&s;ires, by his application to the Pre&s;ident of the Congre&s;s, and Commander in Chief: What was the opinion of Ge|neral Wa&s;hington, if we are to judge by his orders? They agreed with the re&s;olves of Congre&s;s: And as to the Members of Congre&s;s, all that I ever heard &s;peak of them, exactly corre&s;ponded with Mr. Gerry, who wrote me his opinion of the matter, in the following words: "With re&s;pect to &s;mall Regimental Ho&s;pitals, I cannot but think them an unnece&s;&s;ary and dangerous in&s;titution; for, upon every removal of &s;uch regi|ments, tho&s;e Ho&s;pitals are a dead weight, and mu&s;t be removed, or be expo&s;ed to the enemy. The latter, you will agree, is by no means admi&s;&s;ible; and the remov|ing &s;uch Ho&s;pitals, is attended with hard&s;hips to the di&s;ea&s;ed, and prevents them from an early recovery."</P>
<P>Let us attend to what he next writes, of REGI|MENTAL SURGEONS: "As to the REGIMENTAL SURGEONS, &s;ays he, being otherwi&s;e wholly USELESS, I have always &s;uppo&s;ed, that they were never intended to an&s;wer any other purpo&s;e, in time of war, than to cure, in camp, &s;light wounds and di&s;ea&s;es, by which the patients were not confined, and to attend the regiments, in time of action; to dre&s;s the wounded &s;oldiers, un|til they can be removed to the General Ho&s;pital."</P>
<P>Where per&s;ons of rank and influence, as General Officers and Members of Congre&s;s, draw &s;uch different ways, is it po&s;&s;ible for any man, to conduct in &s;uch a manner, betwixt them, as to give &s;atisfaction to every one?</P>
<P>But that it may be &s;een, how I endeavoured to di&s;|charge my duty, by adhering exactly to my orders, where they re&s;tricted me to a point; and yet in pruden|tials accommodated my&s;elf, as well as I could, to the

<HEAD>INSTRUCTIONS TO JOHN WARREN, E&s;quire, SURGEON of the GENERAL HOSPITAL.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>New-York,</HI><DATE><HI>June</HI> 12, 1776.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU are de&s;ired to go over to Long-I&s;land, and to con&s;ult with General Green, about the proper hou&s;es for the forming of an Ho&s;pital (to be part of the General Ho&s;pital) for the reception of the &s;ick in his Brigade. For your a&s;&s;i&s;tants you will be plea&s;ed to take over three of the Ho&s;pital Mates, of which Mr. Glover is to be one, the other two as you agree with the other Surgeons.</P>
<P>Make out a proper a&s;&s;ortment of medicines, &s;uch a li&s;t as you think needful, after con&s;ulting with Doctors Fo&s;ter Adams and M'Knight, and order it to be put up from the Ho&s;pital &s;tores: If you have occa&s;ion for fur|ther a&s;&s;i&s;tants, make a requi&s;ition from General Green's Brigade, of as many Surgeons and Mates as you &s;hall &s;tand in need of.</P>
<P>Keep a regi&s;ter of the &s;ick, in which you are to make an entry of the times of their admi&s;&s;ion and di&s;charge, as well as of the di&s;ea&s;es they labour under, and require of the re&s;pective Surgeons of the different regiments, weekly returns of the &s;ick in the Ho&s;pital belonging to their regiments, in order to compare with yours: From which, once a month, a roll is to be made out for re|ceiving the ration money, from the Commi&s;&s;ary Gene|ral; which you will get &s;igned by the Brigadier-Gene|ral, after you have compared it with the return of &s;ick born on the rolls of the Regimental Surgeons: From the time they are admitted into the General Ho&s;pital,
<PB N="117" REF="015447_0082_0F9982C4A43D9E50">
their rations are to be &s;topped in the regiments. The li&s;t of the Regimental Surgeons, compared with yours, ought to be delivered by them to the Adjutant, or Quarterma&s;ter of every regiment, in order to prevent rations being drawn for the &s;ick, in the regiments, &s;o long as they remain in the ho&s;pital.</P>
<P>You will be plea&s;ed to fix up, in the ho&s;pital, the re|gulations already agreed upon by the Surgeons of the Ho&s;pital, for the government of the officers, nur&s;es, attendants and patients; and appoint &s;ome per&s;on to have them read in every ward: The rules of diet, ought to be fixed up in the &s;ame place, and a &s;trict at|tention paid to the &s;ame.</P>
<P>You are to take over Mr. Weld, to act as a Store-keeper, who is to obey your commands in all things relating to his department: Whatever &s;tores you have occa&s;ion for, in the department of the Commi&s;&s;ary-General, or Quarterma&s;ter-General, you will apply for by an order under your hand, &s;igned by order of the Director-General, with your name, of which di|rect the Storekeeper to keep an exact account, and of the di&s;tribution of the &s;ame.</P>
<P>What nur&s;es you require for the &s;ick, you will engage at the price of half a dollar per week; the number not to exceed one for every ten per&s;ons, &s;ick or wounded; the nece&s;&s;ary labourers to be employed by the day, as u&s;ual, in which avoid engaging a greater number than is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>Deliver out no &s;tores of any kind to the Regimental Surgeons: When the &s;ick require further aids than they can give, let them be reported to you, and if their ca&s;es require, receive them into the General Ho&s;pital.</P>
<P>Take with you at lea&s;t 1500 bandages, and a quan|tity of tow, with a &s;et of capital in&s;truments, and all &s;uitable dre&s;&s;ings, in ca&s;e of an action.</P>
<P>U&s;e your be&s;t endeavours to make the Surgeons and Mates of the regiments attentive to their duty.</P>
<P>For any debts contracted for the u&s;e of the General-Ho&s;pital,
<PB N="118" REF="015447_0083_0F9982C5E6A20F78">
agreeable to the above rules, draw on me. You will employ the &s;ame per&s;on to &s;upply fre&s;h meat, and at the &s;ame prices, as in the ho&s;pital at New-York.</P>
<P>Weekly returns of the &s;ick to be &s;ent over early eve|ry Monday morning as u&s;ual.</P>
<P>Be plea&s;ed to call on Mr. Delamater, for 100 addi|tional blankets, for the u&s;e of the ho&s;pital in Long-I&s;land, and as many beds, applying to the Quarterma&s;ter for &s;traw, from time to time, and order the nur&s;es, wa&s;her women, &amp;c. to clean them from time to time.</P>
<P>An orderly Mate is to take charge of the blankets, and bedding, &amp;c. and of the Ho&s;pital furniture every week; to enter into a book for the purpo&s;e, what &s;tores of this kind are given out, to examine what each &s;ick brings with them, and to &s;ee that nothing is carried out, on their di&s;mi&s;&s;ion, not belonging to them.</P>
<P>An orderly &s;erjeant, or corporal, or careful &s;oldier, (if the General will allow) ought to be &s;tationed at the ho&s;pital, to take charge of the arms, &amp;c. of the &s;ick, whil&s;t in the ho&s;pital, and to give them up on his death or di&s;mi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>A Carpenter, ought to attend con&s;tantly, to make coffins, or perform other work, for which you will ap|ply to the Quarterma&s;ter-General.</P>
<P>No blankets, or other effects of the Ho&s;pital, to be expended at the funeral of tho&s;e &s;oldiers, who die in the ho&s;pital.</P>

&s;tate of his health, General Sullivan was appointed to &s;ucceed him in the command; on which I thought it my duty to communicate to him, the plan ob&s;erved in the government of the General Ho&s;pital, and for the regulation of the Regimental Surgeons, and to acquaint him with the above in&s;tructions to Dr. Warren, and the mode in which he managed his department; and wrote him a letter on the &s;ubject, that he might the bet|ter retain the principal heads of the proceedings, in his memory, &s;hould he have any occa&s;ion to refer to them, in i&s;&s;uing out orders, re&s;pecting the &s;ick and wounded, as the enemy were already on Long-I&s;land; and &s;ome important engagement with them, expected daily.

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Received your favour of ye&s;terday; am much plea&s;ed with your plan, re&s;pecting the Surgeons; &s;hall take care that it is in every re&s;pect carried into ex|ecution; and am, with re&s;pect,</P>

</LETTER>
<P>And now, whil&s;t I am on the &s;ubject of ortlers i&s;&s;ued by me, to the different Gentlemen, for the better ma|nagement of the General Ho&s;pital, on who&s;e care I was to depend principally, for their being carried into exe|cution, I mu&s;t take the liberty to ob&s;erve, that were I to tran&s;cribe all I have delivered to them, in writing on|ly, for that purpo&s;e, it would require a &s;eparate vo|lume.</P>
<P>To Doctor Fo&s;ter, as being the elde&s;t Surgeon, I wrote much and often; and have now before me, co|pies of various orders to him, in a &s;eries of letters, &amp;c. of
<PB N="120" REF="015447_0084_0F9982C621B98F68">
which I will only mention dates, and occa&s;ions, without detaining the reader with particulars. The fir&s;t (with|out date) was on his &s;etting out from Cambridge, about the latter end of March, or beginning of April, 1776, to e&s;tabli&s;h a General Ho&s;pital, at New-York. The next, likewi&s;e from Cambridge, April 22d: The next was at New-York, on my &s;etting out from thence, for the management of the Ho&s;pital in my ab&s;ence, whil&s;t I proceeded to Philadelphia, to apply to Congre&s;s for further in&s;tructions, though I came away without ob|taining them, but not without application, and as long time of attendance, as the General would allow me. The next, were dated at New-York, Augu&s;t 5th, the 19th, the 23d, and 27th; and September the 9th. The next, was al&s;o at New-York, September the 13th, for the intended removal of the &s;ick and wounded, to Newark, re&s;pecting the manner of their removal, and the provi&s;ion to be made for them, on that occa&s;ion, and for taking care of them, by the way. The next are dated September 24, October 18, and 20; November 3d, and 6th; whil&s;t he had the care and &s;uperintendance of the &s;ick at Newark; and of December the 10th and 31&s;t; and January the 10th, at Bethlehem, for remo|val to the ea&s;t &s;ide of Hud&s;on's River.</P>
<P>Numerous and particular are the directions, which, in like manner, I have delivered in writing, on various occa&s;ions, as well as verbally, to Doctors Warren, Adams, M'Knight, Turner, and Eu&s;tis, Surgeons in the General Ho&s;pital; on their being detached to dif|ferent places, for the e&s;tabli&s;hment of Ho&s;pitals, for the conveniency of the &s;ick, in parts di&s;tant from each other, in which my directions were drawn up with con|&s;ideration, and not in a carele&s;s, negligent, or perfunc|tory manner; for that was neither the way, in which I cho&s;e to do bu&s;ine&s;s my&s;elf, or to require others to perform it, who were &s;ubject to my authority.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now explain another difficulty, to which I was often &s;ubjected.</P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="015447_0084_0F9982C621B98F68">
IT was no unu&s;ual thing for Officers and Regi|mental Surgeons, on detached po&s;ts, wherever they happened to be &s;tationed, though ever &s;o di&s;tant from the main body of the army, whether on a march, or a retreat, to expect a General Ho&s;pital to accompany, or follow them in the rear; as if it were po&s;&s;ible, like the Polypus, though cut up into ever &s;o many pieces, that each part &s;hould in&s;tantly repullulate, and become an entire Ho&s;pital, properly furni&s;hed with every ne|ce&s;&s;ary accommodation, attendants, and conveniences, although amid&s;t Highlands, alps, or a for&s;aken and wa&s;ted country, without any help or a&s;&s;i&s;tance from tho&s;e who had the command; or, as if it were po&s;&s;ible to &s;ave, or remove the weighty and cumber&s;ome appa|ratus, every where, with as much expedition as they could retreat, and without any regard to the unfitne&s;s of the place for a General Ho&s;pital.</P>
<P>I hope no intention of di&s;re&s;pect will be imputed to me, when I am &s;ometimes nece&s;&s;arily obliged to make u&s;e of the names of Gentlemen of rank, for whom I have a per&s;onal and due re&s;pect, in the cour&s;e of relat|ing facts, which the vindication of my conduct requires I &s;hould di&s;cu&s;s, with all becoming freedom, I think it proper to guard again&s;t &s;uch a wrong &s;uppo&s;ition, on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>At a time when I had formed General Ho&s;pitals at Newark, Hackin&s;ack, North-Ca&s;tle, Stamford, and Norwalk, all crowded with &s;ick, to the number of near 4000 men; and of cour&s;e, the Ho&s;pital Surgeons, who were not numerous, &s;tationed at various di&s;tances, through a &s;pace of near an hundred miles, were fully em|ployed, I received a letter from General Heath, at Peek's-Kill; of all places I have &s;een one of the wor&s;t, that could be thought of for a General Ho&s;pital, as well for want of accommodations, as of a proper coun|try, to &s;upport it: It bore date, November the 19th, on which he ob&s;erved, that there was neither General Ho&s;pital, nor any one General Ho&s;pital Surgeon, at
<PB N="122" REF="015447_0085_0F9982CB835921C8">
that po&s;t; that he received daily complaints from the Colonels of the &s;everal regiments, of the &s;ufferings and di&s;tre&s;&s;es of the Regimental &s;ick; and that "the neg|lect of them, was likely to prove very prejudicial to the inli&s;tment of a new army."</P>
<P>From the &s;imilarity of language in this letter, the complaints of officers concerning the &s;ufferings of the &s;ick, and the evil con&s;equences that were predicted of their proving prejudicial to the inli&s;tment of a new army, I was apprehen&s;ive of the latent influence, and was determined, if I could any ways prevent it, they &s;hould not have it in their power to lay the fault at my door. I might, indeed, have remon&s;trated to the General, that it was the duty of the Regimental Surgeons to &s;end their &s;ick, whom they could not take care of, to the neare&s;t branch of the General Ho&s;pital, wherever I thought it mo&s;t convenient for fixing it, and which I never did, without fir&s;t advi&s;ing with the officers who were in chief command, that they might be properly taken care of: But in&s;tead of that, the General Ho&s;pi|tal was expected to attend every movement of theirs, not &s;o much for &s;ending their &s;ick into it, as to claim &s;upplies from it, or Ho&s;pital Surgeons to attend their regiments as was &s;ometimes required, whil&s;t they were ab&s;ent, and &s;cattered through the neighbouring States, in pur&s;uing the uniform &s;cheme they con&s;tantly kept in view, of e&s;tabli&s;hing Regimental Ho&s;pitals, for which they explored di&s;tant towns, and retired to them with part of their &s;ick: The&s;e places became an a&s;ylum for idlene&s;s, riot and di&s;&s;ipation, for when once they got into &s;uch places, they were in no ha&s;te to return, and the numbers that re&s;orted to them, increa&s;ed amaz|ingly.</P>
<P>On receipt of General Heath's letter, I determined to ride from North-Ca&s;tle to Peek's-Kill, to wait up|on him, and concert the nece&s;&s;ary &s;teps to be taken, for accompli&s;hing his de&s;ire, which I did; but fir&s;t, I repre&s;ented to him, how impracticable the de&s;ign of
<PB N="123" REF="015447_0085_0F9982CB835921C8">
having a General Ho&s;pital there was, unle&s;s convenient quarters were fir&s;t in readine&s;s; that the providing quarters for the reception of the men being in the Quarterma&s;ter General's department, was under Gene|ral Heath's command, and not in my power; but if he would undertake to give &s;uch orders, as would be exe|cuted, for the appropriating and fitting up rooms and births, for 300 &s;ick, and would enforce obedience to the orders of Congre&s;s, October 9th, to allow no Re|gimental Ho&s;pitals in the neighbourhood of the Gene|ral Ho&s;pital; and would call on the Regimental Sur|geons, to remain with their re&s;pective corps, agreeable to General Wa&s;hington's plea&s;ure, of November 5; and to make &s;uch regular returns of the &s;ick, that I could know the &s;tate of them; ordering &s;ome atten|dants on the Ho&s;pital, that would be much wanted, I would forthwith &s;end a detachment of the General Ho&s;pital to attend his commands. I acquainted him, that it would an&s;wer no purpo&s;e, but to bring unmerit|ed reproach on the ho&s;pital, if Gentlemen were &s;ent up to take charge of it, and, when they came, no quar|ters could be had for their accommodation, or that of the &s;ick<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See my complaince on this head, page 45.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>That the nature of the e&s;tabli&s;hment and manage|ment of a Military Ho&s;pital might be the better under|&s;tood, I drew up, November 20, an account of what|ever was nece&s;&s;ary, for providing quarters and accom|modations, furni&s;hing of &s;upplies, and for the regular admi&s;&s;ion, care and attendants on the &s;ick, with the ne|ce&s;&s;ary reports to be made, from time to time, to con|duct matters with regularity, and to di&s;cover who do their duty, and who neglect it; &s;o that if complaints are made of the &s;ufferings of the &s;ick, it may be known where the fault lies, and how to correct it. The&s;e I enclo&s;ed in my letter to him.</P>
<P>In return, the General "thanked me by letter, ap|proved of my care and attention, and commended my
<PB N="124" REF="015447_0086_0F9982CF253C6CC8">
plans and directions; and, as General Sullivan had done before, promi&s;ed to take care that they were, in every re&s;pect, carried into execution."</P>
<P>Doctor Adams, and Doctor M'Knight, &s;ucce&s;&s;ively waited upon General Heath, by my de&s;ire, to reque&s;t that he would order &s;uch quarters, for the &s;ick at Peek's-Kill, as were nece&s;&s;ary for a General Ho&s;pital, which they were to direct; but never could be provid|ed with any proper accommodations, when they were there; but, were obliged to cro&s;s the Highlands, to Fi&s;h-Kills, twenty miles off, before they could meet with any &s;uitable place, for the reception and accom|modation of the &s;ick.</P>
<P>Of the clamours of Regimental Surgeons, from want of Medicines.</P>
<P>OF all the complaints that have been made in re&s;pect to the &s;ufferings of the &s;ick, none have been &s;o loud and clamorous, as tho&s;e proceeding from a want, or pretended want of medicines. I proceed, therefore, to examine into the nature and cau&s;es of tho&s;e complaints, and I doubt not, to be able to convince the impartial world, and Congre&s;s it&s;elf, that whether or not the Gentlemen, that compo&s;e that illu&s;trious body, can ju&s;t|ly exculpate them&s;elves from the charge of neglect, in not providing the nece&s;&s;ary &s;upplies of medicines, for the Regimental Surgeons, and furni&s;hing them there|with in &s;ea&s;on to be of u&s;e to them, I am free from any merited blame, on that account. And I wi&s;h the reader to remark, that the complaints, on account of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">uffer|ings of the &s;ick, from want of medicines, were but mere whi&s;pers before the battle and retreat from Long-I&s;land, compared to the clamours from that time forwards.</P>
<P>From the day of that retreat, Augu&s;t 28, 1776, a dreadful &s;cene of confu&s;ion and di&s;order took place, which had a particular effect in disjointing all the mea|&s;ures of the Regimental Surgeons, and involving the
<PB N="125" REF="015447_0086_0F9982CF253C6CC8">
affairs of the General Ho&s;pital department, &s;o far as it was complicated therewith, in the greate&s;t difficulties, for the remainder of the year</P>
<P>The&s;e misfortunes were increa&s;ed by the ob&s;tinacy of the Regimental Surgeons, in with&s;tanding the orders of Congre&s;s; in which they were &s;till &s;upported by offi|cers, who, to put the mo&s;t favourable con&s;truction on their motives, were either not acquainted with the de|terminations of Congre&s;s re&s;pecting them, or not &s;kil|ful in the duties of Regimental Surgeons, and the na|ture of Military Ho&s;pitals; or they were owing to the want of a proper arrangement in &s;ettling the duties of the Regimental Surgeons, and providing them with the proper means of di&s;charging tho&s;e duties. This may be imputed to the va&s;t variety of bu&s;ine&s;s, that con|&s;tantly occupied the Congre&s;s, which did not leave them &s;ufficient lei&s;ure to attend to them, or their not &s;ufficiently under&s;tanding the &s;ubject, from the defect of experience, on the fir&s;t rai&s;ing of an army; whereas they ought to have been early provided with medicines, in&s;truments and bandages, by a Continental Druggi&s;t, or cho&s;en Committee, before the campaign began: And the militia which came late to the field, &s;hould have been provided by the different States, before they joined the army: Some of them did not come till ju&s;t before, and many not till after the retreat from Long-I&s;land; and then came wholly unprovided with tho&s;e articles, at a time when it was impo&s;&s;ible, if there had been ever &s;o great a plenty of medicines in the ho&s;|pital or army, &s;ubject, as both were, to continual move|ments, and when the officers of the ho&s;pital were divided, and as bu&s;ily employed as men could be in taking care of the &s;ick and wounded, to di&s;pen&s;e them out to all applyers.</P>
<P>I early fore&s;aw that this evil might happen, and as ear|ly pointed it out to the General, in the month of Fe|bruary, for the &s;ake of applying a remedy, and of not being burdened with the charge of it, as may be &s;een in my letter to him, page 32. The contents of this let|ter,
<PB N="126" REF="015447_0087_0F9982CF2AB8FB30">
I al&s;o communicated to Congre&s;s, the fir&s;t oppor|tunity <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> I had for doing it, in per&s;on, which was in June following.</P>
<P>And after the retreat from Long-I&s;land, I de&s;cribed my own &s;ituation to them, and that of the Regimental Surgeons, in the live left terms I could, praying for farther a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and pointing out the means of it, without &s;ucce&s;s, as my letters to different members of the Medical Committee, will abundantly prove; but all my applications, on this &s;ubject, were in vain. I never received the lea&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;tance from them.</P>
<P>In my narrative to General Wa&s;hington, from page 7, to page 12, I have de&s;cribed what pains I had been at, to make provi&s;ion of medicines, for the Regiment|al Surgeons, and to have the mode of furni&s;hing the &s;upplies clearly and properly e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>
<P>To what I then wrote, I have now to add &s;ome fur|ther ob&s;ervations, to free me from any mi&s;repre&s;ent|ation, on this head.</P>
<P>When I made an offer of my be&s;t &s;ervices to the Me|dical Committee of Congre&s;s, to &s;upply the Regiment|al Surgeons at New-York, with regimental che&s;ts, though not in my line of duty to do &s;o; it was not be|cau&s;e I wi&s;hed for the employ, being already burdened with much more bu&s;ine&s;s than belonged to my place, but becau&s;e I did not find that Congre&s;s had taken any &s;tep for the purpo&s;e; and was apprehen&s;ive, le&s;t when the evil ari&s;ing from the neglect thereof, &s;hould be more &s;en&s;ibly felt and complained of, the ill con&s;equen|ces of that neglect would be charged upon me; and I expected thereby to get rid of a &s;till greater evil, with which I heard I was threatened, as I told the Commit|tee, that of being called on to furni&s;h the ho&s;pitals and regiments, in the northern department, with in&s;tru|ments, medicines, &amp;c. a thing impracticable in my &s;i|tuation, and in the exhau&s;ted &s;tate of America in re|&s;pect to them. And I &s;till expected, if Congre&s;s ac|cepted of my propo&s;al, they would have appointed an
<PB N="127" REF="015447_0087_0F9982CF2AB8FB30">
apothecary for the army, di&s;tinct from the ho&s;pital; or to have had the medicines put up at Philadelphia, in proper che&s;ts for regiments, to be &s;ent to camp, duly pre|pared, of which I left with the Committee a proper li&s;t for the purpo&s;e. But what is &s;urprizing, they never gave me any an&s;wer to the&s;e propo&s;als, &s;o that notwith|&s;tanding I engaged in the bu&s;ine&s;s, I never was proper|ly authorized, or a&s;&s;i&s;ted for the di&s;charge of that &s;la|vi&s;h employment; although, it &s;eems, I was an&s;werable for the con&s;equences of my offer, as though I had been enabled, in every re&s;pect, to perform it.</P>
<P>Far be it from me, to charge the Committee with neglect in this bu&s;ine&s;s. All I mean is to defend my|&s;elf again&s;t any imputation. What an&s;wer did they ever give me on that &s;ubject? None, except what is contained in a re&s;olve of Congre&s;s, July 17th, of which I knew nothing, till that month was nearly expired; for when I was obliged by the General's order to return to camp, they had come to no determination. Nor, do tho&s;e re&s;olves enjoin it as a duty: They only forbid the Regimental Surgeons to draw any thing from the ho&s;pital, except in&s;truments and medicines</P>
<P>That it was not the intention, however, of Con|gre&s;s, to give them a right to demand the&s;e, except, as mentioned in the printed letter, page 72, (a copy of which I had laid before the Committee in June.) in &s;mall quantities, only to &s;erve them till they could be &s;upplied from any neighbouring place, is evident from the following con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>The Congre&s;s had committed their &s;tock of medi|cines at Philadelphia, into the hands of Mr. William Smith, and by a vote of theirs appointed him Conti|nental Druggi&s;t, or Commi&s;&s;ary of Medicinal Stores, for which they allowed him pay, equal to go dollars per month. What was I to conclude from hence, but that the Congre&s;s had &s;een &s;it, and proper it was it &s;hould have done it long before to relieve me from a ta&s;k foreign to my &s;tation, and to provide a per&s;on on

purpo&s;e to &s;upply the wants of the Regimental Sur|geons: And that this was their idea, will appear far|ther probable, if it may be &s;uppo&s;ed the mind of Con|gre&s;s was known to one of their Members, who, &s;ome time after this, in a letter he wrote to me, expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf as follows: "With re&s;pect to &s;upplying the Regimental Surgeons with medicines, I am fully of opinion that the Directors cannot well attend to it, but the applica|tion ought to be to them; in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, and they to &s;ign orders on the Continental Druggi&s;t, for &s;o ma|ny che&s;ts as they &s;hall judge nece&s;&s;ary, and have the medicines a&s;&s;orted, as they &s;hall think proper."</P>
<P>IN REGARD TO INSTRUMENTS; anxious to have it in my power to furni&s;h the ho&s;pitals more plentiful|ly, as I had found it nece&s;&s;ary to increa&s;e the number of Ho&s;pital Surgeons and Mates, and to recruit my &s;tock of medicines, which was almo&s;t wholly exhau&s;ted of capital articles, I &s;ent Doctor Bi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">y to Philadelphia, a gentleman of the ho&s;pital, in who&s;e zeal and activity I placed great reliance, to forward to camp, with all di&s;patch, what medicines I had there of my own, and as much as he could procure from Congre&s;s, for I could not be &s;ufficiently &s;upplied at New-York. I enjoined him to u&s;e the utmo&s;t diligence to purcha&s;e in&s;truments, if to be had, ready made, or to engage a workman to make a great number of &s;ets, on my ac|count. He &s;oon informed me, by letter, that there were no in&s;truments to be purcha&s;ed at any rate; and that the only workman in the city that could make &s;ur|geon's in&s;truments was engaged by Mr. Mar&s;hall, for the Congre&s;s; and that he could not undertake any work for me, for a long time to come. Is not this an addi|tional proof that Congre&s;s, in their re&s;olves of July 17th, did not intend to make me an&s;werable for the &s;upplying of Regimental Surgeons, either with medi|cines or in&s;truments; or, if it was their intention that I &s;hould furni&s;h them; why did they not enable me to do it? Or why did they deprive me of the means?</P>
<P><PB N="129" REF="015447_0088_0F9982CFE88E8D98">
By much a&s;&s;iduity, Doctor Binney, who was detain|ed near a month in Philadelphia, at length &s;ent for|ward &s;uch a &s;upply of medicines as he could procure, which was very different, however from the li&s;t I had &s;ent for, which arrived at Newark <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> &s;hort time before the retreat from Long-I&s;land. It was then un|&s;afe to attempt, if not impracticable to get them over to New-York; on which account, till the army abandon|ed the city, and the ho&s;pital &s;tores were all removed to Newark, they remained there, where they had been left, except &s;ome articles which were wanted to &s;upply the General Ho&s;pital, formed at this time near King&s;|bridge, towards which place the army had retreated. I fixed Mr. Cutting, A&s;&s;i&s;tant Apothecary, at Newark, which I con&s;idered as the mo&s;t convenient and proper place at the time, for &s;toring the medicines I had col|lected there, and referred &s;uch Regimental Surgeons, as applied to me for medicines, to him. This being my magazine of all that were mo&s;t valuable, or mo&s;t in de|mand, I felt the lo&s;s more &s;en&s;ibly, when they were ta|ken out of my hands, in &s;o irregular a manner, as I have already de&s;cribed in the fir&s;t part of this work.</P>
<P>IN no part of the va&s;t variety of duty and fatigue that I went through, have I been &s;o &s;en&s;ible of ILL TREATMENT, as in what related to the &s;upplies of medicines and ho&s;pital &s;tores, except the more &s;hame|ful and injurious manner in which I was deprived of them. It is next to impo&s;&s;ible, to de&s;cribe the toils that my&s;elf, and mo&s;t of the Gentlemen of the ho&s;pital, have endured in that bu&s;ine&s;s; and the injurious reflex|ions that have been ca&s;t upon me, for conducting this affair, in a way the mo&s;t meritorious, is truly matter of a&s;toni&s;hment, and only to be equalled by the treat|ment I met with from Congre&s;s, in return for all tho&s;e &s;ervices.</P>
<P>To judge of this matter clearly, it is nece&s;&s;ary to call to mind the difficulties under which I laboured for want
<PB N="130" REF="015447_0089_0F9982D0B233A388">
of &s;ufficient help, to con&s;ider the &s;carcity and value of medicines, and how trouble&s;ome or impracticable to procure them, in quantity, in America. I found no large &s;tock on hand, when I fir&s;t took charge of the ho&s;pital, to &s;upply the va&s;t demands of an army, in which generally more is wa&s;ted than u&s;ed: The &s;tricte&s;t oeconomy was al&s;o enjoined me, in &s;upplying the wants of the ho&s;pital, however much the plan of Congre&s;s is now changed. It is worth ob&s;erving here, that the fir&s;t piece of bu&s;ine&s;s the Congre&s;s employed me in, af|ter my appointment to the Director-General&s;hip, was to look over a li&s;t of medicines made out by my pre|dece&s;&s;or, and not a large one, to &s;upply the immediate wants of the ho&s;pital: A Committee of Congre&s;s put it into my hands, not &s;o much, as I could under&s;tand, to add to it, if I thought nece&s;&s;ary, as to curtail it: What was &s;aid on the occa&s;ion, at lea&s;t, looked that way. With &s;uch views, &s;uch wants, and &s;uch oecono|my demands were made on me, from all quarters of the army, and out of the army, to di&s;tant parts of the country. All the a&s;&s;i&s;tance Congre&s;s allowed by their original e&s;tabli&s;hment to procure a&s;&s;ort, prepare and di&s;pen&s;e medicines, was one apothecary It being im|po&s;&s;ible to perform this &s;ervice, without further help, a mate had been employed before my arrival, and an a&s;&s;i&s;tant with little more than &s;oldiers pay, whom I al&s;o found here on my arrival, and continued him in his place, without being allowed any other help, till the year was almo&s;t over; when the Congre&s;s by their third re&s;olve of October 9, 1776, at once, enjoined me to furni&s;h &s;uch further quantities of medicines and bedding, as I might judge expedient, and impowered another, at the &s;ame time, to deprive me of what I had, with toil and fatigue immen&s;e, collected, and &s;aved from de&s;truction.</P>
<P>To be ordered by the General to collect medicinal &s;tores, in the manner already mentioned, and to be abu&s;ed and calumniated for performing that duty; and after &s;upplying che&s;ts to five battalions at Bo&s;ton, near

fifty at New-York, and &s;ent twenty more to the nor|thern department, and furni&s;hed the ho&s;pitals at Long-I&s;land, New-York, Newark, Hackin&s;ack, and Kings-bridge; and when I made demands on the Continental Druggi&s;t for a &s;mall &s;upply, to a&s;&s;ort what remained on hand, not to be furni&s;hed with that nece&s;&s;ary &s;upply, was hard to be born: And yet to be baited like a bear at the &s;take, with ince&s;&s;ant demands, and made re&s;pon|&s;ible for the clamours of the Regimental Surgeons, for all the wants of new troops daily arriving, without &s;up|plies, and for the &s;ufferings of the &s;ick, ari&s;ing from their oppo&s;ition to General Orders; and &s;o artfully excited that if I was at the General Ho&s;pital, crys were rai&s;ed becau&s;e I was not at camp, and if at camp, that they could not meet me at the General Ho&s;pital, was not le&s;s intolerable. The &s;ame noi&s;e pervaded from the remote&s;t towns in the neighbouring States, to which the Regimental Surgeons had conveyed the &s;ick, beyond the reach of relief, to terrify and alarm the country. Nor were the&s;e circum&s;tances &s;ufficient to fill up the mea&s;ure of my di&s;tre&s;s. The mo&s;t affecting repre&s;ent|ations were made to the General, from the di&s;tance of &s;everal hundred miles, a&s;cribing the misfortunes of the army, ready to mutiny at the northward, to me, when I had early acquainted Congre&s;s with their &s;ituation, and prayed for relief for them in vain, although no part of my care. And notwith&s;tanding I had &s;ent them what I could &s;pare from my own &s;tock, and officers to a&s;&s;i&s;t them, at the earne&s;t reque&s;t of the director; I never met with the lea&s;t acknowledgment for the&s;e &s;er|vices from the Congre&s;s but, on the contrary, the &s;trange&s;t and mo&s;t uncival returns from the Secretary, only for pre&s;uming to inquire of him, concerning the nature of the appointments Congre&s;s had made in &s;ome other departments, for the care of the &s;ick, that I might the better under&s;tand, and under&s;tanding, better perform my own duty. Can there be a more &s;triking in&s;tance of ingratitude than I have met in the whole of
<PB N="132" REF="015447_0090_0F9982D1712D33F0">
my treatment, where the obligations to &s;hew me a very different one, for my attention to, and for the manner of di&s;charging my tru&s;t, were neither &s;mall nor few.</P>
<P>I &s;hall here relate an in&s;tance of in&s;olent and injurious treatment I met with, for what I had not done, in place of thanks for what I had done to &s;erve the nor|thern department. It is contained in a letter from a certain Par&s;on David Avery to Doctor Lind, and for|warded by him to the General, in September la&s;t; in which, after giving a high wrought de&s;cription of the &s;ufferings of the &s;ick, at the lakes, for want of medi|cines, he introduces this virulent a&s;per&s;ion: "Men of chief con&s;ideration, (&s;ays he) are more than unea|&s;y on this head, and do not he&s;itate to &s;peak freely of fir&s;t rate characters, as the authors of tho&s;e calamities, &s;ome blaming the Congre&s;s, and &s;ome the Surgeon-Ge|neral, (meaning the Director-General) of the Ameri|can Army, and &s;ome the Director of the Northern De|partment. For my part, continues this reverend ca|lumniator, I will not &s;ay which of them is the mo&s;t guilty, but this I will affirm, that great guilt lies at &s;ome one's door." Strange that a preacher of the go&s;pel, which breathes charity to all, and e&s;pecially to &s;trangers, &s;hould carry the poi&s;on of a&s;ps under his tongue, and &s;pout forth his venom at this indi&s;criminate rate, again&s;t per&s;ons whom he knows little of, as is the ca&s;e at lea&s;t of one that had nothing to do in this matter, but as an act of extra-official benevolence, and who, though oppre&s;&s;ed, as he was, with the greatne&s;s of his own burden, &s;trove to mitigate and lighten that of others! And &s;uch are the grateful returns made to him for it.</P>
<P>BUT a circum&s;tance that happened at that time, which I think of the mo&s;t con&s;equence to explain ful|ly to the public is the REMOVAL of part of the HOSPI|TAL STORES from New-York to Stamford, previous to
<PB N="133" REF="015447_0090_0F9982D1712D33F0">
the evacuation of Long-I&s;land, and from thence to the interior parts of Connecticut; as this tran&s;action was laid hold of as a handle of cen&s;ure again&s;t me, and induced the General, by one of his aids, to write to, and acquaint me with the mi&s;erable &s;ituation to which the &s;ick were reduced, and the clamours excited, as it was alledged, (but without rea&s;on,) for want of medi|cines as &s;et forth in my narrative, page 12, and 13. I &s;hall now prove the truth of what I there alledged; that it was by his Excellency's own order, that I &s;hip|ped the &s;tores which were &s;ent to Stamford; and the &s;ending them from thence farther inland, was by his commands, of which I had no knowledge at the time, whence the General him&s;elf, and every other rea&s;ona|ble per&s;on, mu&s;t be &s;o far from condemning, that they cannot, in ju&s;tice, but approve my conduct. This ac|count will likewi&s;e evince the impracticability of what he afterwards in&s;i&s;ted upon I &s;hould comply with im|mediately; but will &s;hew, at the &s;ame time, that it was undertaken with all diligence, and executed with all po&s;&s;ible di&s;patch.</P>
<P>Sanguine as the generality of men unexperienced in military operations were, that the &s;trength of our works, and &s;o large an army as we had, were &s;ufficient to defend New-York, again&s;t all the force that could be brought again&s;t it; others, of better under&s;tanding and cooler judgment, had great abatements in their belief of it. At any rate, they concluded it was very po&s;&s;ible the town might be de&s;troyed by the &s;hipping, whether a landing was effected or not. Had a &s;hell fallen a|mong&s;t the combu&s;tible articles of medicines, the whole might be de&s;troyed, to the irreparable lo&s;s of the army. I therefore a&s;ked the General what he thought of removing tho&s;e articles that could be be&s;t &s;pared for the pre&s;ent, and mentioned Stamford, as a place to which they might be ea&s;ily tran&s;ported by water, and from whence they might, at any proper time, when wanted, be brought back either by water or land. He
<PB N="134" REF="015447_0091_0F9982D22763D4F0">
not only approved of the propo&s;ition for their remo|val, but ordered it to be carried into execution, as ex|peditiou&s;ly as I could. At this time, being the month of Augu&s;t, I had as I imagined, &s;upplied almo&s;t every regiment in the army, with medicine che&s;ts: But fre&s;h demands occurring every day, and the want of a tran&s;|port ve&s;&s;el, impeded the performance of the General's commands, for &s;ome weeks.</P>
<P>It being in the mo&s;t violent heat of &s;ummer, and &s;o the le&s;s wanted, I ordered the greater part of the rugs and blankets, the newe&s;t and be&s;t bedding, of which I had collected a very large &s;tock, and a thou&s;and &s;heets of which I had lately got to the amount of near two thou&s;and, many of them new, and a number of new &s;hirts, at New-York, to be &s;et apart for the purpo&s;e; and a large quantity of heavy ho&s;pital furniture, &s;ome of the large&s;t be&s;t metal and iron mortars, a number of crates of vials and gaily pots, the large&s;t bottles, with the mo&s;t bulky articles, and tho&s;e in the lea&s;t demand, as &s;ome hog&s;heads and ca&s;ks of ca&s;carilla, and other &s;uch particulars as we could be&s;t &s;pare, to accompany them. To the&s;e, I ordered a &s;hare of whatever we had in &s;o great a plenty, as not to fear being &s;oon de&s;titute of them, to be added, with a &s;mall a&s;&s;ort me <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of cho&s;en medicines, to be made up, and kept together in one or two &s;uitable boxes, as a re&s;erve, mo&s;t likely to be wanted, and the mo&s;t ea&s;ily to be got at, on any pre&s;&s;ing occa&s;ion. In the mean while the Briti&s;h troops landed at Long-I&s;land, and many officers and &s;ome Surgeons, perhaps the very men, who were afterwards foremo&s;t in the clamour, for want of medicines, came to the ho&s;|pital, and expre&s;&s;ing their apprehen&s;ions for the &s;afety, took upon them to be very importunate for the remo|val of the ho&s;pital &s;tores. I met the Adjutant-Gene|ral, and told him in what &s;tate they were, and as re|ports of &s;ome frigates being &s;hortly expected to appear in the &s;ound prevailed, I propo&s;ed, once more, to know the General's mind, with regard to the removal of the
<PB N="135" REF="015447_0091_0F9982D22763D4F0">
&s;tores: He told me he had heard the General expre&s;s him&s;elf on the &s;ubject very lately, with wi&s;hes of their being gone; whereupon he, believing it to be &s;o, in|formed him of &s;uch his a&s;&s;urance, that they were alrea|dy &s;ent away; and urged me to lo&s;e no time to have it done. A &s;mall tran&s;port being forth with engaged, the abovementioned &s;tores, amounting to eighteen tons, were immediately put on board, and &s;ent off, under the care of Doctor Ledyard, of the ho&s;pital; they were &s;afely landed at Stamford, and committed to the care of John Lloyd, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> of that place, who &s;tored them in his own hou&s;e.</P>
<P>An apprehen&s;ion and alarm prevailing &s;oon after, that the enemy were about to make a &s;udden de&s;cent upon that place, and might de&s;troy the &s;tores if not re|moved farther from the &s;ound; Mr. Lloyd wrote to the General on the &s;ubject, and received his commands in return; in pur&s;uance of which the Committee had them removed further into the interior country, and particularly the mo&s;t valuable were conveyed to no le&s;s a di&s;tance than fifty miles, for &s;afety; of which I had no notice at the time, but have &s;ince obtained a copy of the General's order for their removal, and a certificate from the Committee at Stamford, of their removal, in virtue of the General's &s;aid order, contained in the fol|lowing letter.</P>

<P>Long-I&s;land was abandoned to the Briti&s;h troops, 3 days before the date of the above letter; and in le&s;s than 3 weeks more, New-York al&s;o fell into their hands. With difficulty could the remaining ho&s;pital &s;tores be &s;aved, by tran&s;porting them, over the North River to the Jer&s;eys, and thence to Newark. And yet it was within ten days, from that time, and whil&s;t I was taking mea&s;ures to overlook and put in order the medi|cines, and to get a fre&s;h li&s;t of capital articles, wanted to a&s;&s;ort them, that, owing to the clamours beforemen|tioned, I received that &s;evere and unmerited reprehen|&s;ion, quoted in my narrative, page 13.</P>
<P>I wrote to Philadelphia for medicines, but could get none, or next to none. The Gentlemen, to whom I wrote, acquainted me their &s;hops were exhau&s;ted. From the Continental Druggi&s;t I obtained a very &s;mall &s;upply indeed, with a proper apology for it.</P>
<P>Under all the&s;e difficulties, I did not &s;lacken my en|deavours to obtain a &s;upply.

Eu&s;tis; both of whom furni&s;hed, from the ho&s;pital, all Regimental Surgeons who applied, with whatever medicines they called for, to the full of their demands. By the exacte&s;t accounts and returns of the patients re|ceived into the ho&s;pital at Stamford, from November 5th, to the time of my di&s;mi&s;&s;ion being known there, in February following, the amount was near thirteen hundred, of whom the number, remaining in the ho&s;|pital, was then reduced to twenty-five, in all. Doctor Eu&s;tis informed me, that upwards of &s;even hundred &s;ick and wounded were well provided for, by means with which I had &s;ufficiently furni&s;hed him, whom he was enabled to attend, much to their &s;atisfaction; and that when he left Norwalk, in March, the number re|maining was reduced to eight or ten.</P>

<P>That in the beginning of October, 1776, Doctor John Morgan, then Director General of the Ho&s;pitals, of the American Army, made application to me, by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, for my a&s;&s;i&s;tance, in &s;upplying the troops of the State of Connecticut, with medicines and other nece&s;|&s;aries for their &s;ick; mentioning the general want there|of, and his inability (without &s;ome aid of this kind) to an&s;wer the numerous demands daily made on him, and the con&s;equent di&s;tre&s;s of the &s;ick and wounded of the army. In compliance with which reque&s;t. I im|mediately &s;ent Doctor Philip Turner, with a quantity of nece&s;&s;ary articles to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and by this means the complaints of the &s;oldiery were greatly le&s;&s;ened.</P>

WERE it nece&s;&s;ary to produce other evidences of the pains I took to acquaint Congre&s;s of the &s;uffering condition of the &s;ick, I could refer to a number of let|ters I have written to &s;everal of the members, contain|ing a particular hi&s;tory of the movements of the ho&s;|pitals and &s;ick, during the whole campaign, particu|larly to Mr. Gerry, Member for Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay, and Doctor Ru&s;h, of Philadelphia, and e&s;pecially in a letter I wrote to the former, October 6th.</P>
<P>In that letter I informed him "of the great cla|mours that prevailed, at the time, among&s;t the Regi|mental Surgeons, becau&s;e they could not be &s;upplied with every thing they wanted, from the General Ho&s;pi|tal, of which I gave him a full and ju&s;t repre&s;entation. It contained, likewi&s;e, a long and particular relation of all my proceedings in the care of my department, from the time I entered into the &s;ervice, to that period, con|formable to what I have delivered in my narrative to General Wa&s;hington. I pointed out to him the &s;tate of the Regimental Surgeons, ever &s;ince I entered into the &s;ervice, and the de&s;titute condition they were in, at my fir&s;t arrival in the army, in re&s;pect to all &s;orts of &s;tores, in|&s;truments and medicines. I acquainted him with the pains I had been at, to furni&s;h them with nece&s;&s;aries, and the extent to which I had done it, with my appli|cations to the General and Congre&s;s to &s;ettle the chan|nels of &s;upply, and with the applications to me from Ca|nada, for that purpo&s;e. I let him know, that I had &s;ent off to the amount of twenty regimental che&s;ts, for the troops at Lake George and Albany, be&s;ides what I had &s;ent to General Gates at Ticonderoga, (exclu&s;ive of be|twixt forty and fifty regimental medicine che&s;ts, &s;up|plied to the forces under the immediate command of General Wa&s;hington,) and acquainted him with what had been &s;ent by the General's order to Stamford."</P>
<P>"I further gave him as exact a de&s;cription, as it was in my power, of the &s;tate of the &s;ick and wounded, and of the unu&s;ual complaints among&s;t the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">; of
<PB N="139" REF="015447_0093_0F9982D502D75738">
the continual vici&s;&s;itude in the &s;tate of the &s;ick, from the various movements of the army, and con&s;equent &s;hiftings of the ho&s;pital; and of the difficulties to which this reduced the officers employed in attending it; of the nece&s;&s;ity we were under to remove the &s;tores and &s;ick to Newark; and the ob&s;tacles we had to overcome, under many inconveniences, to convey them to a place of &s;afety, and to provide them with quarters; and with|all, I told him of the unruly behaviour of the &s;urgeons of the militia regiments and their tumultuous appli|cations for medicines; and informed him how widely they were &s;cattered through the country; of the de&s;er|tion of &s;ome of the Regimental Surgeons, and the calls on the Mates of the Ho&s;pital to &s;upply their places."</P>
<P>"I concluded my letter to him with the following ob&s;ervations: "Upon the whole matter, it ap|peared to me, that a general mi&s;take prevailed concern|ing the duty of the Regimental Surgeons, and the man|ner in which they ought to be furni&s;hed with in&s;tru|ments, medicines and nece&s;&s;ary &s;tores. I gave it as my opinion, in the mo&s;t expre&s;s terms, that they ought not to depend on the General Ho&s;pital for them, be|cau&s;e, in its pre&s;ent exhau&s;ted condition, and the loo&s;e &s;tate in which every thing was, from the &s;cattered con|dition of the &s;ick, and the va&s;t variety of duty, and infinite fatigue of the department, it was impo&s;&s;ible for me to furni&s;h the Regimental Surgeons, and not e&s;&s;en|tially injure, or totally overthrow the General Ho&s;pi|tal. And ob&s;erved to him, that whil&s;t there was &s;uch a limitation in the number of &s;urgeons and other offi|cers in the ho&s;pital, and the Regimental Surgeons could claim any right to depend upon it for &s;upply of what they required, it mu&s;t &s;oon be entirely exhau&s;ted of the means of an&s;wering its de&s;ign, and be rendered wholly u&s;ele&s;s. I therefore recommended to Congre&s;s, the ap|pointment of proper per&s;ons, to look out, and purcha&s;e medicines &s;ufficient for a &s;tore to be formed at Phila|delphia, from whence what might be wanting for regi|mental
<PB N="140" REF="015447_0094_0F9982D56EAD2C48">
u&s;e, could be &s;ent up in proper che&s;ts to every Regimental Surgeon, as his occa&s;ions required."</P>
<P>"Thus, I ob&s;erved, being &s;omewhat more di&s;engaged from the pre&s;ent innumerable calls on me, that were foreign to my duty, I &s;hould enjoy more lei&s;ure for what were proper to my &s;tation, and then would &s;ketch out &s;ome further plan for the better government of the General Ho&s;pital and Regimental Surgeons, and the be&s;t means of furni&s;hing the needful &s;upplies." And, &s;oon after, I &s;ent &s;uch a li&s;t of medicinal &s;tores and &s;urgeons in&s;truments, &amp;c. as I concluded would be ne|ce&s;&s;ary for an army of 20,000 men, for a twelvemonth, including both ho&s;pitals and regiments.</P>
<P>I accordingly drew up the above mentioned plan in a few days after, by the General's Orders; which being fir&s;t &s;ubmitted to his remarks, and tho&s;e of Lord Ster|ling, and of General M'Dougall, as it was agreed up|on, was then forwarded &s;hortly after, by General M'Dougall, to General Green, that his remarks being added, it might be returned to me, with all di&s;patch, to compare the whole, and revi&s;e it for laying before the Congre&s;s.</P>
<P>As General Green had &s;hewn &s;o much zeal in the affair, and had made &s;uch warm repre&s;entations, &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ively, to General Wa&s;hington, and to the Pre&s;ident of the Congre&s;s, on the &s;ubject, &s;etting forth, that if the pre&s;ent evil was not quickly remedied, it would fa|tally injure the &s;ervice: I did not doubt, that he would give it all po&s;&s;ible di&s;patch, and &s;end it to me, &s;o &s;oon as he could examine it. But although I wrote, and &s;ent me&s;&s;age after me&s;&s;age, I could never get it again, till a few days before Chri&s;tmas, when I called on him for it, in per&s;on, and received it, without the benefit of a &s;ingle ob&s;ervation of his, to accompany its return, However, I &s;at down, &s;o &s;oon after as I could, and re|duced the whole into eight articles, which I enclo&s;ed to Mr. Samuel Adams, to lay before Congre&s;s, with two &s;heets of paper, containing remarks, and rea&s;ons in &s;up|port
<PB N="141" REF="015447_0094_0F9982D56EAD2C48">
of them. Of the&s;e, together with what I had communicated to the Committee, at my conference with them in June, and to &s;everal of the Members, in my letters to the Pre&s;ident and others, I find they have not di&s;dained to make great u&s;e, in the arrange|ments which have &s;ince taken place, on a very large &s;cale, and e&s;pecially in what related to the arrangement of the &s;uperior officers, and the &s;ubordination they have traced out in the department.</P>
<P>I have not mentioned Gen. Green's omi&s;&s;ion to per|form what he undertook, from believing it to be volunta|ry; but as &s;ome per&s;ons, who having no better rea&s;on at hand to a&s;&s;ign for my removal, have, it &s;eems, charg|ed me, with having promi&s;ed to lay &s;ome plan before Congre&s;s, for better regulating the department, and having then neglected it for near three months, during which time, many of the evils complained of, continued without redre&s;s, I thought it became me to give a true re|lation of the cau&s;e of that delay, &s;o far as it re&s;pected my&s;elf. I doubt not General Green's being able to give &s;uch &s;ub&s;tantial rea&s;ons for his delaying to perform his promi&s;e, as will be fully &s;atisfactory: But as that regards him more than my&s;elf, I leave it to him to &s;tate this matter as he plea&s;es, if he &s;hould chance to think the taking notice of it at all, to be worthy of his attention.</P>
<P>BESIDES the afore-de&s;cribed letter to Mr. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, written with a view to give Congre&s;s all nece&s;|&s;ary information of the &s;tate of my department, and every thing that had a relation to it, to awaken their attention to the &s;tate of the &s;ick and Regimental Sur|geons, as well as the ho&s;pital department, to make what reformations and amendments in it they thought pro|per, I wrote a letter to Dr. Ru&s;h, a Member of the Medical Committee; and from the &s;ame motive, my anxiety on account of the &s;ufferings of the &s;ick, to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ou&s;e the attention of Congre&s;s to make this matter a

&s;erious &s;ubject, before they &s;hould be compelled to do it, from being overtaken with tho&s;e calamities which too &s;oon after came on, and, with the rapidity of a tor|rent, &s;wept away many hundreds, if not thou&s;ands, in|to the ocean of eternity.</P>
<P>Although it is a long letter, and contains repetitions of matters, &s;ome of which I have already mentioned, more than once; yet on that very account, of their be|ing repetitions, they have their u&s;e; and the length of my letter, at a time when I had &s;o much to claim my attention, is a proof that my mind was deeply engaged in the &s;ubject: They carry with them the mo&s;t convin|cing evidence, that if the &s;ick &s;uffered, as they indi&s;put|ably did, more than might be expected, had the Con|gre&s;s done their part, either in making the nece&s;&s;ary provi&s;ion, before the campaign began, or under&s;tood how to regulate matters rightly at fir&s;t; or had been as attentive, in applying &s;ea&s;onable remedies, as I was, to point out the di&s;orders and means of redre&s;s, it was not owing to any neglect of mine, or any fault that I have yet been reproached with, from want of expe|rience or abilities for the ta&s;k, or of zeal and activity in di&s;charging my duty: But of this, let the impartial judge. The letter is as follows.</P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>BY command of General Wa&s;hington, all the &s;ick and wounded, both in the General Ho&s;pital, and tho&s;e remaining under the care of Regimental Sur|geons, are removed within the&s;e two days, to this &s;ide the river, and chiefly in this neighbourhood: They amount to &s;everal hundreds, in addition to about 300 who were before removed to Newark, and 4 or 500 in Orange County. I have neither Commi&s;&s;ary near at hand, nor Quarterma&s;ter, and brought with me only
<PB N="143" REF="015447_0095_0F9982D5EAA96EB8">
three Mates: One Surgeon who was to follow, is hourly expected. The General's commands were to leave a re|&s;pectable body of Surgeons and Mates above King&s;bridge, a general action being daily expected, as the whole force of the enemy is drawn to that quarter. So &s;oon as I get this part of the General Ho&s;pital into order and re|gularity, I am to return, and provide accommodations at the White Plains, for which indeed I gave the nece&s;|&s;ary orders before I came over, that in ca&s;e the commu|nication by the North-River &s;hould be cut off, for a while, which no doubt the enemy mean to attempt, &s;uitable provi&s;ion may be made for the wounded, &s;hould there be a general action, which is daily expected. I wrote to Mr. Gerry, giving an account of the &s;tate of the ho&s;pital, &s;ince the affair of Long-I&s;land which I wi&s;h you to &s;ee. My anxiety to pre&s;erve ho&s;pital &s;tores occa&s;ioned my removal of the heavy articles to Stam|ford, which I effected, ju&s;t in time to prevent their fall|ing into the enemy's hands. Great part of what re|mained at New-York, were again divided, part to be removed to King&s;bridge, with the Ho&s;pital Surgeons and Mates, who remained with the army; the re&s;t to be &s;ent with the &s;ick to Newark. In packing and unpack|ing medicines, and dealing them out, with other ho&s;pi|tal &s;tores, to Regimental Surgeons and Mates, near one half of our mates of the ho&s;pital have been employed the whole &s;ummer and autumn, to this time, to the mere &s;ubver&s;ion, and almo&s;t total de&s;truction, of the Ge|neral Ho&s;pital. We are now &s;carcely any thing more than collectors and retailers to Regimental Surgeons and Mates; and the &s;tores are &s;o divided, wa&s;ted, and di&s;&s;i|pated, that without a new arrangement, and abundant more a&s;&s;i&s;tance than we have, or can have, or the ho&s;|pital continuing fixed in one place, we &s;hall &s;hortly be incapable of yielding any a&s;&s;i&s;tance at all. The greate&s;t difficulty is the &s;upplying medicines to the whole army. Think how I came to have that charge, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> addition to my duty as Director-General, &amp;c. and that it was only

de&s;igned as a temporary expedient, and con&s;ider the difficulties and inconveniences of continuing to execute it, and you mu&s;t &s;oon be convinced how impracticable it is for me to an&s;wer <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words">. When I fir&s;t ar|rived in the army. I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> Regimental Surgeons de|&s;titute of medicines, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> and bandages; there|fore a u&s;ele&s;s &s;et, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> I repre&s;ented this to General Wa&s;hington, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> pointed out to him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> ne|ce&s;&s;ity of every regiment <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;upplied, the en&s;uing campaign, with a medicine che&s;t for the whole year: But where to get the medicines was the que&s;tion, or who was to fit out the Surgeons I recommended an application to Congre&s;s, to employ &s;ome one in Phila|delphia, to provide che&s;ts for each regiment. Whil&s;t matters were under con&s;ideration, Bo&s;ton was evacuated by the Briti&s;h troops: By dint of unwearied a&s;&s;iduity, I collected a great number of blankets, beds and rugs, which had been left, by the Briti&s;h army, in ho&s;pitals, barracks, and in the river: I had them wa&s;hed, and made fit for u&s;e By the General's Orders I took po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of a large Druggi&s;t's &s;hop, and a &s;mall one of a private practitioner, after they were gleaned of capital articles, as camphor, rhubarb, bark, opium. &amp;c. The General concluding it would be a means of &s;upplying the regiments, as well as General Ho&s;pital, ordered me to purcha&s;e &s;uch articles as were wanted, and as I could get, and make out che&s;ts for every regiment, in the ar|my which he commanded: This made it late before I could get to New-York, and above half the mates were employed, in packing and accompanying the medicines to New-York. Hearing, on my arrival, that the Con|gre&s;s had a large a&s;&s;ortment of medicines at Philadel|phia, and being called upon by the &s;urgeons, in the nor|thern department, to &s;upply them, I ha&s;tened to Phila|delphia to confer with a Committee of Congre&s;s, and have my duty better a&s;certained: I found that of a va|luable a&s;&s;ortment of capital articles, which the Congre&s;s had purcha&s;ed, there had been con&s;iderable deduction&s;
<PB N="145" REF="015447_0096_0F9982D6B1252570">
for the u&s;e of the &s;outhern army, and part &s;old, as if the quantity was greater than was required for public u&s;e: On which I repre&s;ented to the Committee the nece&s;&s;ity of hu&s;banding the &s;tock well. I begged that a &s;hare might be appropriated for the u&s;e of the army under General Wa&s;hington, and undertook to furni&s;h for the pre&s;ent campaign, the regiments of that army, with che&s;ts for the campaign, not imagining they would ex|ceed the number of 40 regiments, e&s;pecially as the Flying Camp was to form a &s;eparate department; and was fearful le&s;t, if regiments were unequally &s;erved, great part of the Surgeons would be de&s;titute and u&s;ele&s;s. To make out the better, I bought up all the valuable articles I could meet with at New-York, and el&s;ewhere: Be&s;ides 5 regi|ments which I &s;upplyed with che&s;ts at Bo&s;ton, and 20 to the northward, I &s;upplyed, from the beginning of Ju|ly to the middle of Augu&s;t, above 40 che&s;ts. Then fre&s;h demands came from ho&s;ts of militia, the numbers countle&s;s, who joined the army, de&s;titute of every thing nece&s;&s;ary for &s;ick and wounded, as in&s;truments, ban|dages, or medicines: They demanded even their provi|&s;ions, as well as medicines, from me, and our whole force of Surgeons and Mates were chiefly employed to furni&s;h the Regimental Surgeons: The labour was too great, the ta&s;k beyond our abilities, for medicines became more &s;carce every day, and our &s;tores di&s;&s;ipated. The mak|ing provi&s;ion, to &s;ave part of our &s;tores, before the af|fair of Long-I&s;land, and the confu&s;ion in which we have been ever &s;ince, moving about by detachment; the &s;ick &s;cattered, under the care of Regimental Sur|geons, for a tract of 30 miles and upwards; only one apothecary being allowed; no lei&s;ure for either him or me to leave the army, and look out for &s;upplies; and none to be got for writing, or next to none; the wound|ed requiring our care; de&s;titute of help from Quarter-ma&s;ters and Commi&s;&s;aries, when removed to a di&s;tance. All concur to &s;hew that the re&s;olve of Congre&s;s, that the Directors &s;hall &s;upply medicines to the Regimental
<PB N="146" REF="015447_0097_0F9982ECD3C38648">
Surgeons, is a thing impo&s;&s;ible, at lea&s;t in my depart|ment, for any length of time, unle&s;s I am allowed to leave the camp, and range through the different States, or rather to employ a variety of per&s;ons for that purpo&s;e. I have repre&s;ented the matter to the General, and now hope the Congre&s;s will take it into con&s;ideration. I have been reduced to the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;ending a &s;urgeon to proceed through New-England, to collect medicines, as Doctor Stringer is gone in per&s;on, for his depart|ment. I have wrote to Governor Trumbull and the A&s;&s;embly of Connecticut, for their a&s;&s;i&s;tance; to the State of New-York for help; &s;ent for and i&s;&s;ued out all my own &s;tock of medicines; purcha&s;ed from public bo|dies, and private practitioners; wrote to Mr. Ba&s;s, Mr. Smith and others: All is in&s;ufficient. I &s;hall make out another li&s;t, and &s;end to Mr. Smith; but I fear much that I &s;hall not get what I want, in Philadelphia: It is di&s;tre&s;&s;ing to the la&s;t degree, to be harra&s;&s;ed with &s;uch uncea&s;ing clamorous demands, for what I neither have, nor can get; and if I had them, I have not help &s;uffi|cient to i&s;&s;ue them out, it being as much as two or three per&s;ons can do to prepare, and i&s;&s;ue out medicines for the &s;ick in the General Ho&s;pital, diffu&s;ed as ours is, and nece&s;&s;arily &s;o.</P>
<P>General Wa&s;hington has ordered me to draw up a plan for the government of the General Ho&s;pital, and of the Regimental Surgeons, &s;uch as I think practicable in the execution, and be&s;t calculated to an&s;wer the de|&s;ign of both: I pre&s;ented him with a rough &s;ketch, which he has examined, and made his remarks: Lord Sterling has done the &s;ame; and it is now in the hands of General M'Dougall; and it is to pa&s;s through General Green's, then to undergo corrections and a|mendments, to lay before the Congre&s;s, for which this may prepare you.</P>
<P>This minute I learn, that the Briti&s;h troops have with|drawn from Frog's-Point; are landed at New Rochell;
<PB N="147" REF="015447_0097_0F9982ECD3C38648">
a general action is hourly expected; an important event, on which much depends.</P>
<P>The de&s;ign of this letter is, principally, to prepare the attention of Congre&s;s to the affairs of my department. We want rags, old linnen, bandages, lint, tow, thread, needles and pins, &amp;c. They are not to be got here. Would it not be worth the attention of a Committee of Congre&s;s, or &s;ome active Members, to &s;et &s;ome inhabi|tants of the city to collect the&s;e, and other nece&s;&s;ary articles, and &s;end off with di&s;patch. They cannot come too &s;oon, or in larger quantity than &s;ufficient. The ho&s;pital has been drained by &s;upplying Regimental Sur|geons. We mu&s;t depend on the public to furni&s;h fre&s;h &s;upplies: They are not to be got here: I am over|whelmed with bu&s;ine&s;s; I cannot leave the ho&s;pital to go in &s;earch of them. <HI>I now give notice of my difficulties, while I can, in time, that in ca&s;e of falling &s;hort of the quantity of tho&s;e nece&s;&s;aries, I may not be blamed for the impo&s;&s;ibility of collecting them.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hall inclo&s;e you a li&s;t of medicines wanted for &s;uch an army as General Wa&s;hington's, which I conceive to be rather moderate than extravagant. Without &s;o ca|pital a &s;tock is provided in time, we &s;hall be unfurni&s;hed for another campaign: Nor do I think it &s;ufficient for more than &s;ix &s;uch months as the la&s;t. Judge then whether it will not be nece&s;&s;ary to employ Commi&s;&s;aries to pur|cha&s;e medicines; to prepare them before they come to the army; to provide a place of &s;afety, at a proper di&s;|tance from danger, and not &s;ubject to continual move|ments; to have an Apothecary for the army or regi|ments, di&s;tinct from the Ho&s;pital Apothecary, and mates and labourers to a&s;&s;i&s;t in i&s;&s;uing them out, when wanted, to the re&s;pective Surgeons.

&s;ome relief. There are few, perhaps, but readily con|clude, that this notice of my difficulties produced im|mediate and powerful a&s;&s;i&s;tance; or, that the Congre&s;s did me ample ju&s;tice, in exculpating me from all cen|&s;ure and blame for want of it. Quite the contrary of all this is the fact. No more notice was taken of this information, that ever came to my knowledge, than if it were a tale of what happened in ages pa&s;t, that did no ways concern our&s;elves.</P>
<P>When the remnant of the army that retreated from Brun&s;wick had cro&s;&s;ed the Delaware, I proceeded to Philadelphia, to wait on Congre&s;s, and to lay matters before them in per&s;on, for &s;uch regulations for the bet|ter care of the &s;ick and wounded, as were &s;uitable to the occa&s;ion, and to obtain an explanation and amendment of the re&s;olves of Congre&s;s, October 9th. I met Doc|tor Ru&s;h in the &s;treet, and attempted, for a moment, to detain him, till I could acquaint him with the pre&s;ent circum&s;tances, and &s;ituation of affairs: He gave me no time: All he &s;aid was, that "he was glad I was come; it would take a great burden from his &s;houlders," and pa&s;&s;ed on. When I afterwards called upon him, at his hou&s;e, to repre&s;ent matters to him there, as a Member of the Medical Committee, for relief; the &s;um of his an&s;wer was, that "he would not, for ten times the con|&s;ideration, go through the amazing toils and difficulties of my &s;tation." But in&s;tead of relief from the difficul|ties and hard&s;hip of my &s;ituation, all the returns I re|ceived from Congre&s;s, are complaints di&s;regarded, griev|ances unredre&s;&s;ed, and, without an hearing, and without a&s;&s;igning a rea&s;on, a di&s;mi&s;&s;ion from my &s;tation, as if Congre&s;s intended to fix a &s;tigma on my character. But however hidden the motives for &s;uch conduct are, a day may come, when the&s;e will be fully under&s;tood.</P>
<P>The &s;ame Gentleman who then felt, or &s;eemed to feel for my &s;ituation, having &s;ince accepted a place, near of kin to that which he then &s;o earne&s;tly deprecated, may perhaps remember it. I can truly &s;ay, &s;hould he a&s;pire
<PB N="149" REF="015447_0098_0F9982D7CDE8BAE0">
to, or hereafter enjoy, that very place, I do not wi&s;h him the ill-treatment and ingratitude for his &s;ervices in it, which I have experienced.</P>
<P>TO SHEW how difficult it was for me to re|ceive any exact information from Congre&s;s, on &s;uch particulars as I conceived it nece&s;&s;ary to know, I need only acquaint the reader with the following particu|lars.</P>
<P>Being applyed to by Doctor Potts, who acted in the character of Director in a &s;eparate branch of the nor|thern department, to &s;end him proper per&s;ons, to a&s;&s;i&s;t him, otherwi&s;e it would not be in his power to di&s;|charge the tru&s;t repo&s;ed in him, I nominated two gen|tlemen for that purpo&s;e, in the quality of a Surgeon, and Apothecary to that part of the ho&s;pital.</P>
<P>As other demands of that fort might be made upon me, I wrote to Mr. Charles Thom&s;on, Secretary, re|que&s;ting him to acquaint me, from the Journals of the Congre&s;s, whether the nomination of Surgeons to fill up vacancies, in any part of the General Ho&s;pital of the northern department, re&s;ted with me as Director-Ge|neral and Phy&s;ician in Chief of the American Ho&s;pital. It appeared, that Doctor Stringer had been impowered to take charge of the northern department, the nature of which I did not fully under&s;tand: But I thought the re&s;olves of July 17, la&s;t, warranted me to call upon him, as one of the Directors, for returns of &s;urgeons, mates, and other officers, &amp;c. but then he had wrote word to me, that he conceived him&s;elf to be a &s;enior of|ficer, and upon a &s;uppo&s;ition of our ever coming toge|ther, expected precedence, from that priority, or to take rank of me; and had given me to under&s;tand in expre&s;s terms, that he never would be accountable to me, or to any per&s;on, but the Commander of the parti|cular department where he was, or to the Commander in Chief: And referred me to the votes of Congre&s;s, September 14, for the particulars of his appointment.
<PB N="150" REF="015447_0099_0F9982D821EEB8C8">
Having no acce&s;s to tho&s;e votes otherwi&s;e, I informed the Secretary, in the letter which I wrote him, of my de&s;ire to avoid interfering with Doctor Stringer, in his department, from any mi&s;conception of the intentions of Congre&s;s; and a&s;ked as a favour, that he would be plea&s;ed to let me have a copy of the votes, relative to Doctor Stringer's appointment and in&s;tructions, and to Doctor Shippen's appointment and in&s;tructions, that I might know whether it was the duty of tho&s;e Gentlemen to make me the &s;pecified returns of July 17th, or not.</P>
<P>Did he comply with my reque&s;t? O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> what an&s;wer did this <HI>polite, obliging</HI> Secretary, return me, and two other Gentlemen, Members of Congre&s;s, to whom I al&s;o wrote to reque&s;t they would &s;econd my application to him for copies of the votes and in&s;tructions, &amp;c.? He &s;ent them not, but in place thereof, in a po&s;itive ma|gi&s;terial way, gave me to under&s;tand, (in which how|ever, he was greatly mi&s;taken) that "<HI>undoubtedly,</HI> at the appointment of tho&s;e Gentlemen, they had the &s;ame powers given to them, <HI>in all re&s;pects,</HI> of nominating their own &s;urgeons, nur&s;es, &amp;c. in their departments, as I had my&s;elf in mine; and as to rank and prece|dence, and all that non&s;en&s;e (as he called it) there was nothing in the Journals to e&s;tabli&s;h it."</P>
<P>By this time, I had obtained from Doctor Stringer him&s;elf a copy of his appointment, and of the powers ve&s;ted in him by Congre&s;s, Sept. 14, 1775 (&s;ee page 27) which enabled me to point out his mi&s;take, by &s;hewing him that Doctor Stringer had no power given him, by tho&s;e re&s;olves, of nominating a &s;ingle &s;urgeon, or any officers whatever, except a number of mates, not to exceed four; a power not equal to that given to any of the &s;urgeons, appointed by me, as each of them had a power of nominating five mates; and having taken the liberty to tell this GREATMAN! that in what it con|cerned me to be well acquainted with, for the direction of my conduct, I preferred a &s;tate of facts to his glo&s;&s;|es, on which I could form a judgment of my own, on the evidence they afforded; and that had he been
<PB N="151" REF="015447_0099_0F9982D821EEB8C8">
plea&s;ed to have examined the&s;e re&s;olves of Congre&s;s, his di&s;obliging ob&s;ervations on rank and precedence, might have been &s;pared; I further told him, that men bred up in the army, had different notions from what he &s;eemed to entertain, and that &s;uppo&s;ing their rank and their pay were to come into competition with each other, every officer of &s;pirit and honour, would rather &s;acrifice his pay, as of le&s;s con&s;equence, than his rank; and then a&s;ked him, if it was a matter of no impor|tance, how it came to pa&s;s that the Congre&s;s, in their late re&s;olves, had determined that the &s;urgeons and mates of the ho&s;pital &s;hould take rank of regimental &s;urgeons and mates.</P>
<P>His letter, in reply to this, contained in it &s;everal ex|pre&s;&s;ions &s;o rude, and impertinent to the matter in hand, that I chu&s;e to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> but he very cynically ob|&s;erved, that "having never been conver&s;ant in courts or camps, he doubted not that his way of thinking, (as if that were to be the &s;tandard, and &s;upercede the votes of Congre&s;s, of which he ought to have con&s;idered him|&s;elf the &s;ervant, and not the ma&s;ter) might appear as old fa&s;hioned to them, as their proceedings, at times, appear ridiculous to him, where rank &s;tands for merit, and that fanta&s;tical thing called honour, (with which, by his invectives on it, he gives room enough to &s;uppo&s;e he is little acquainted) &s;upplys the place of virtue;" and con|cluded with a rhap&s;ody on Commonwealths, that I con|ceived to be very foreign to the &s;ubject, as I never a&s;ked for a di&s;play of his principles, having barely reque&s;ted &s;uch information of the re&s;olves of Congre&s;s as might enable me to know, and to di&s;charge my duty, the better. I only wi&s;hed to guard again&s;t breaking down tho&s;e bar|riers, which were mo&s;t like<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">y to &s;ecure my rank and authority from innovations upon them; and which, per|haps, this very Gentleman might be in&s;trumental in in|troducing, afterwards, into the votes of October 9th, which I conceived I had &s;o much rea&s;on to complain of, as the fir&s;t approach that was made to undermine my

But what occa&s;ion is there for further evidence. To accumulate it, would, in my opi|nion, be as unnece&s;&s;ary as to hold up torches to the &s;un.</P>

<P>It may not be improper to &s;ay a few words, re&s;pect|ing the Gentlemen who have acted immediately under me; one of whom is rai&s;ed to the rank of Deputy Di|rector General: None of them, that I know of, have done di&s;credit to their places.</P>
<P>However Congre&s;s may reconcile it to them&s;elves, and to the ju&s;tice that is &s;uppo&s;ed to be due to Gentlemen of unexceptionable characters, that have &s;erved them faithfully, and with approved ability, from the begin|ning of the war; and have de&s;erved well at their hands, for what they have done and &s;uffered, from being con|&s;tantly engaged as Surgeons in the General Ho&s;pital,

&s;ince its fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hment; to pa&s;s them by, and to place over their heads &s;ome who were never before in the &s;ervice, and others who were their juniors; they have, however unintentionally, done great honour to my appointments. Of three Gentlemen whom I no|minated, and who have &s;erved under me, as Surgeons, who are all I ever appointed, and were the younge&s;t in the ho&s;pitals of my department, two of them are pro|moted, by Congre&s;s, to the &s;tations of Phy&s;ician Gene|ral, and Surgeon General, in the Army. Can a &s;tron|ger proof be given of the care and fidelity with which I exerci&s;ed that tru&s;t, than in employing, as officers un|der me, Gentlemen whom the Congre&s;s it&s;elf has &s;een fit, &s;ince, to di&s;tingui&s;h in &s;o extraordinary a manner? And when one of the beforementioned Gentlemen, who had ju&s;t rea&s;on to expect to be noticed among&s;t the fir&s;t appointments in the department, was for &s;ome time, at lea&s;t, wholly overlooked, by them, as he was to my knowledge, probably, becau&s;e he could not con|&s;ent to be troubling Congre&s;s, either by him&s;elf or friends, with &s;olicitations in his behalf, though they were not ignorant of his &s;ervices; and though brother to HIM, who laid down his life in their CAUSE, and who&s;e memory is held &s;acred by them; but who, with|out deriving merit from any extrin&s;ic or adventitious circum&s;tances, has conducted him&s;elf in a manner that reflects honour upon his talents and humanity!</P>
<P>If Congre&s;s could be capable then, of &s;o long neglect|ing the known, but mode&s;t worth of Doctor JOHN WARREN, the world may le&s;s wonder they &s;hould &s;o ea&s;ily get over the obligations they owed to my&s;elf, and to their own reputation.</P>
<P>As to the Mates, many of them are rai&s;ed to the rank of Surgeons of Regiments, and I doubt not, that by their &s;uperior knowledge in the duties of their &s;ta|tion, above what many of their predece&s;&s;ors enjoyed, they will reflect credit on the General Ho&s;pital, under my direction, as a School to qualify them for &s;uperior &s;ervices.</P>
<P><PB N="156" REF="015447_0102_0F9982DDE8B19270">
As to my&s;elf, and the unworthy treatment I have met with; I call it unworthy, for &s;o it is, in re&s;pect to me, however worthy it may be of the authors of it; whatever credit and growing fame &s;ome may imagine they have acquired by it, I con&s;ider it not as any di&s;ho|nour to me, but to tho&s;e only who have procured it. Time, the great revealer of Mens motives as well as actions, will perhaps, one day, un ma&s;k the private and di&s;gui&s;ed de&s;igns of men, who cover them at pre&s;ent, with a pretext of public good, but which are vi&s;ible by their actions to the quicker &s;ight of di&s;cerning men, who judge of a tree, not by its appearances, but its fruits. I do not envy them, but rather wonder, and wi&s;h them to enjoy the ju&s;t reward of their devices.</P>

<P>I doubt not, but they will fail, however, in one part of their de&s;ign, and by endeavouring to throw an odium on my character, fix an indeliable mark on their own; and, perhaps, find that inju&s;tice &s;o &s;weet to their ta&s;te, may, before it is dige&s;ted, bring forth gaul and bitterne&s;s, and what they have &s;owed in deceit and folly, they may reap in remor&s;e and di&s;appointment.</P>
<P>Leaving them, therefore, to the opinion which the ju&s;ter and wi&s;er part of mankind may have of them in this proceeding, and to the operation of that inward monitor in their own brea&s;ts, I am &s;atisfied in having hung out lights to tho&s;e embarked in the &s;ame bottom with de&s;igning men, who &s;teering amid&s;t rocks and quick-&s;ands, "hold them&s;elves in readine&s;s to plunder the ve&s;&s;el they mean to wreck."</P>
<P>I have endeavoured to di&s;charge my duty in what I undertook from principle, according to my degree of knowledge and capacity, with faithfulne&s;s and diligence; and what I value more than knowledge or capacity a|lone, with humanity; from whence re&s;ults the approba|tion of a good con&s;cience, which as my enemies, with
<PB N="157" REF="015447_0102_0F9982DDE8B19270">
all their power, cannot give, &s;o neither can they take away. Why then &s;hould I repine at the portion of difficulties, that, in times like the&s;e, have fallen to my lot, and which I have neither coveted, nor been able to &s;hun? Having been born in freedom, I claim it, in common with every other freeman, as an indi&s;putable, unalienable right, which I have never &s;urrendered to any one, to defend my good name from the attacks of in&s;idious men, of whatever cla&s;s or denomination. Be it ever, therefore, my part to declare, without fear and without re&s;erve, that true Freedom is my "unconquer|ble delight," and that I am equally a foe to fal&s;e preten|ces of liberty, and "to every &s;pecies of bondage," but mo&s;t to "that of the mind."</P>
<P>As to tho&s;e who have made them&s;elves bu&s;y to reflect on my character, I con&s;ider their envy to be rather a proof of merit, than dread the power of their malice to affect me, &s;ince, in every age,

<L><HI>And by the &s;hadow, proves the &s;ub&s;tance true.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>But neither pretending, nor wi&s;hing, to derive any merit from that &s;ource, I willingly &s;ubject the validity of the preceeding narrative, and exact repre&s;entation of facts, to the &s;tricte&s;t &s;crutiny of the impartial and di&s;|intere&s;ted part of the community: To their equitable and candid deci&s;ion therefore, this Defence of my pub|lic conduct, again&s;t all the &s;ecret arts and impotent ma|lice of a &s;et of invidious and plotting men, who have &s;ought to e&s;tabli&s;h their power and influence, on my injured Innocence and Reputation, is chearfully &s;ub|mitted.</P>
