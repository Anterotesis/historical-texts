<HEAD>THE Rev. Mr. WHITEFIELD's ANSWER To the BISHOP of LONDON's LAST PASTORAL LETTER.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I NEED make no Apology for troubling your Lord&s;hip with this. As your Lord&s;hip was plea&s;ed to make me the chief Subject Matter of your <HI>la&s;t Pa&s;toral Letter,</HI> I think it my Duty to an&s;wer it in the be&s;t Manner I can.</P>
<P>Your Lord&s;hip is to be highly commended, for the Care you have taken in Watching over the Souls of tho&s;e, who are committed to your <HI>Lord&s;hip'</HI>s Charge.&mdash;<HI>Luke-warmne&s;s</HI> and <HI>Enthu&s;ia&s;m</HI>

are the two Rocks, again&s;t which even well-meaning People are in Danger of &s;plitting All ought to be thankful to that Pilot, who will teach them to &s;teer a &s;afe and middle Cour&s;e&mdash;I would gladly hope, that, <HI>a Zeal for God in the Di&s;charge of your Duty, and a hearty Concern for the Safety of Souls</HI> moved your Lord&s;hip to write.&mdash;The&s;e are the Principles, I tru&s;t, which now ex|cite me, to direct this An&s;wer to your Lord&s;hip. And, ble&s;&s;ed be <HI>God,</HI> that I can write with &s;ome|what of that Love and Meekne&s;s which becomes a Di&s;ciple of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t,</HI> and with all that Hu|mility and Reverence, which is due from a Pre&s;|byter to a Bi&s;hop of the Church of <HI>God.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Lukewarmne&s;s</HI> and <HI>Enthu&s;ia&s;m,</HI> my Lord, are certainly the Bane of true <HI>Chri&s;tianity.</HI> I thank your Lord&s;hip again for your kind Cautions a|gain&s;t them. The only Query is, <Q>Whether there was any Occa&s;ion for your Lord&s;hip's warning the People of your Dioc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">s, again&s;t running into either of the&s;e Extremes, upon ac|count of any thing I have either &s;poken or wrote?</Q> Your Lord&s;hip thinks there was; And you quote Pa&s;&s;ages out of my <HI>Journal</HI> to prove it; if it can be proved, I will ask publick Pardon, both of your Lord&s;hip and Them, with all my Heart.</P>
<P>As for your Cautions again&s;t <HI>Lukewarmne&s;s,</HI> I am not much concerned in them. You do not &s;eem to point at me in particular; unle&s;s it is, where your Lord&s;hip, (<HI>Page</HI> 10) informs your
<PB N="3" REF="004457_0003_100D84166A8DE008">
People, <Q><HI>That a diligent Attendance on the Duties of the Station wherein Providence has placed them, is, in the &s;tricte&s;t Sen&s;e, the &s;erving of God.</HI></Q> None but tho&s;e, who condemn Me unheard, can ju&s;tly charge Me with affirming to the contrary.</P>
<P>However, I beg Leave to ob&s;erve, that your Lord&s;hip, (<HI>Page</HI> 8.) calls that a very <HI>imperfect State</HI> of Chri&s;tianity, which is no <HI>State</HI> of <HI>Chri&s;tianity</HI> at all. St. <HI>Paul</HI> writing to the <HI>Corinthians,</HI> 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> Chap. 13. v. 5. &s;ays, <HI>Examine your &s;elves, whether ye be in</HI> the Faith; <HI>Prove your own &s;elves.</HI> And that they might have a certain Rule, whereby to judge whether they were <HI>in the Faith,</HI> truly &s;o called, or not; he immediately adds, <HI>Know ye not your own&s;elves, how that Chri&s;t Je&s;us is</HI> IN you, <HI>except ye be Reprobates?</HI> So that, according to St. <HI>Paul'</HI>s Rule, <Q>He that finds, he has hitherto contented him&s;elf with a bare bodily Attendance upon the Publick Wor&s;hip of <HI>God,</HI> and following his daily Employment on other Days, and with ab|&s;taining from the more gro&s;s and notorious Acts of Sin, and from doing any Hurt or Injury to his Neighbour, and has re&s;ted finally upon the&s;e as the Whole of that Chri&s;tianity requires of him;</Q> is &s;o far from being in a very <HI>imperfect State,</HI> as your Lord&s;hip is plea&s;ed to affirm, (<HI>Page</HI> 8) that he is in no State of <HI>Chri&s;tianity</HI> at Al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">. No, My Lord, he is a <HI>Reprobate, i. e.</HI> one who at pre&s;ent is out of a State of Salvation, nor can he ever have any A&s;&s;urance that he is in a State of Salvation, till he <HI>Knows that Je&s;us Chri&s;t

is IN Him,</HI> by the <HI>indwelling of His Holy Spi|rit.</HI> If I have mi&s;taken your Lord&s;hip's Expre&s;&s;ion, I will freely beg your Pardon.</P>
<P>Another Thing, My Lord, to me &s;eems dark|ly expre&s;&s;ed in (<HI>Page</HI> 8) (Oh<HI>!</HI> let not your Lord&s;hip be angry, for indeed I will endeavour to &s;peak with all Gentlene&s;s and Humility!) Your Lord&s;hip's Words are the&s;e. <Q><HI>Nor need they any other Evidence be&s;ides tho&s;e</HI> Good Di&s;po&s;itions <HI>they find in their Hearts, that the Holy Spirit of</HI> God <HI>co|operates with their hone&s;t Endeavours to &s;ubdue Sin and grow in Goodne&s;s.</HI></Q> If by <HI>Good Di&s;po&s;itions,</HI> your Lord&s;hip only means <HI>Good Inclinations or De&s;ires,</HI> I deny <HI>That</HI> to be a &s;ufficient Evidence, that the <HI>Spirit</HI> of <HI>God</HI> co-operates with their hone&s;t En|deavours to &s;ubdue Sin and grow in Goodne&s;s&punc; For there is a great Difference between <HI>Good De|&s;ires</HI> and <HI>Good Habits.</HI> Many have <HI>One,</HI> who never attain to the <HI>Other.</HI> Many have good De&s;ires to &s;ubdue Sin, and yet, re&s;ting in tho&s;e good De|&s;ires, <HI>Sin has</HI> always had <HI>Dominion over them.</HI> A Per&s;on &s;ick of a Fever! may de&s;ire to be in Health, but that De&s;ire is not Health it &s;elf. In like Manner many have good Di&s;po&s;itions or de|&s;ires to be Good, but That is not Goodne&s;s it &s;elf. And con&s;equently Men need more Evidence than good Depo&s;itions, to prove to Them&s;elves or Others, <Q>That the Holy Spirit of <HI>God</HI> co-operates with their hone&s;t Endeavours to &s;ubdue Sin.</Q> If by good <HI>Di&s;po&s;itions,</HI> your Lord&s;hip means Good Habits wrought in the Heart by the Spi|rit

of <HI>God,</HI> &s;uch as Peace, Love, Joy, Long-&s;uffering, Goodne&s;s, Truth, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> I then agree, a Man needs no other Evidence. For the&s;e are the proper and genuine Fruits of the Spirit it &s;elf.</P>
<P>Your Lord&s;hip immediately adds, <Q>Nor that, per&s;evering in their Cour&s;e, and praying to <HI>God,</HI> for his A&s;&s;i&s;tance, and relying upon the Merits of <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> for the Pardon of all <HI>Such</HI> Sins, Fail|ings, and Imperfections, as are more or le&s;s unavoidable in this mortal State.</Q> I beg leave to ask your Lord&s;hip, whether this does not fa|vour too much of the common Divinity, <HI>viz.</HI> That we are to do &s;ome thing for our&s;elves; or, in other Words, that we have partly a Righte|ou&s;ne&s;s of our own, and that <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o make UP the Deficiencies of That Righteou&s;|ne&s;s? What el&s;e can your Lord&s;hip mean, by &s;aying, That we mu&s;t rely on the Merits of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> for the Pardon of <Q>all <HI>Such</HI> Sins as are more or le&s;s unavoidable in this mortal State?</Q> Did <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> come into the World, My Lord, only to &s;ave us from the Guilt of <HI>Such Sins,</HI> as are more or le&s;s unavoidable in this mortal State? The Scriptures every where affirm, That Man hath no Righteou&s;ne&s;s of his own, That <HI>there is none Righteous, no not one:</HI> That <HI>all Our Righteou&s;|ne&s;s is as fil&s;hy Rags;</HI> and that <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> died not only to &s;ave us from the Guilt of all <HI>&s;uch Sins, Failings,</HI> and <HI>Infirmities,</HI> as are more or le&s;s unavoidable in this mortal State, but from all willful
<PB N="6" REF="004457_0005_100D841CCDB91B78">
Sins, and al&s;o from that original Corruption, which every Man naturally engendred of the Off-&s;pring of <HI>Adam,</HI> brings into the World with him. I hope, I have not mi&s;under&s;tood or over|&s;trained your Lord&s;hip's Expre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>I come now to your Lord&s;hip's Caution again&s;t <HI>Enthu&s;ia&s;m.</HI> For that I &s;uppo&s;e your Lord&s;hip intended more particularly again&s;t me.</P>
<P>And here, my Lord, I beg Leave to ob&s;erve, That, in my Opinion, your Lord&s;hip has by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o Means been clear enough in your Definition of the Word <HI>Enthu&s;ia&s;m.</HI></P>
<P>According to the fair Rules of Writing&punc; was it not fir&s;t Incumbent on your Lord&s;hip to &s;hew, that the Word <HI>Enthu&s;ia&s;t</HI> had a good as well as bad Meaning: That it &s;ignifies no more than <HI>a Per&s;on in God,</HI> and con&s;equently every Chri&s;tian, in the proper Sen&s;e of the Word, is an <HI>Enthu|&s;ia<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t?</HI> For St <HI>Peter</HI> writes, <HI>That to us are given ex|ceeding great and precious Promi&s;es, that by the&s;e we might be Partakers of the divine Nature.</HI></P>
<P>And our Church &s;ays. If we receive the Sacra|ment worthily, We are one with <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> and <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> with us, We dwell in <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> and <HI>Chri&s;t</HI> in us. For which &s;he has &s;ufficient Warrant from our <HI>Lord's Prayer,</HI> John 17. 20. <HI>Neither pray I for the&s;e alone, but for them al&s;o which &s;hall believe on Me through their Word.</HI> Ver. 21. <HI>That they all may be one, As Thou Father art in me, and I</HI> in <HI>Thee, that they al&s;o <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> be one</HI> in <HI>us.</HI> Ver. 23. <HI>I</HI> in <HI>them and they in Me, that they may be made perfect in one.</HI> Ver. 26.
<HI><PB N="7" REF="004457_0005_100D841CCDB91B78">
that the Love wherewith Thou ha&s;t loved me, may, be</HI> in <HI>them&punc; and I</HI> in <HI>them.</HI></P>
<P>But, indeed your Lord&s;hip's Definition of <HI>Enthu&s;ia&s;m,</HI> when examined, does not convey any ill Idea at all. <Q><HI>Enthu&s;ia&s;m,</HI> is a &s;trong Per&s;wa&s;ion on the Mind that they are guided in an <HI>extraor|dinary</HI> Manner, by immediate <HI>Impul&s;es</HI> and <HI>Im|pre&s;&s;ions</HI> of the Spirit of <HI>God.</HI></Q> Had your Lord|&s;hip &s;aid, a &s;trong but <HI>Groundle&s;s</HI> Per&s;wa&s;ion, that they are guided in an extraordinary Manner, it would have been to your Lord&s;hip's Purpo&s;e. But to affirm, without any Re&s;triction, that a &s;trong Per&s;wa&s;ion that we are guided man ex|traordinary Manner by immediate Impul&s;es, is <HI>Enthu&s;ia&s;m</HI> in the wor&s;t Sen&s;e of the Word, when your Lord&s;hip your&s;elf &s;ays, (<HI>Page</HI> 54) <Q>There is, no doubt, but <HI>God,</HI> when He plea&s;es can work upon the Minds of Men by <HI>extraordinary</HI> Influences,</Q> to me &s;eems a little incon&s;i&s;tent.</P>
<P>Your Lord&s;hip proceeds thus. <Q>And this is owing chiefly to the Want of di&s;tingui&s;hing aright between the <HI>ordinary</HI> and <HI>extraordinary</HI> Operations of the <HI>Holy Spirit.</HI> The extraordina|ry Operations were tho&s;e, by which the A|po&s;tles and Others, who were entru&s;ted with the fir&s;t Propagation of the Go&s;pel, were en|abled to work Miracles, and &s;peak with Tongues in Te&s;timony, that their Mi&s;&s;ion and Doctrine were from <HI>God.</HI></Q></P>
<P>I &s;uppo&s;e, by <HI>extraordinary</HI> Operations, your Lord&s;hip means the &s;ame as being guided in an
<PB N="8" REF="004457_0006_100D841E5D691D20">
<HI>extraordinary Manner</HI> ju&s;t above. And if &s;o, ac|cording to your Lord&s;hips own Definition, I am no <HI>Enthu&s;ia&s;t.</HI> For I never did pretend to tho&s;e <HI>extraordinary</HI> Operations of working Mira|c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">, or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> with Tongues, in Te&s;timony, that my Mi&s;&s;ion and Doctrine were from <HI>God;</HI> I only &s;ay Claim to the ordinary Gifts and In|fluences of the <HI>Spirit,</HI> which your Lord&s;hip, (<HI>Page</HI> 20) &s;ays, '<HI>Still continue</HI>': And what Need was there then, my Lord, that the People of your Lord&s;hip's Dioce&s;e &s;hould be cautioned again&s;t <HI>Enthu&s;ia&s;m</HI> upon my Account?</P>
<P>But your Lord&s;hip farther adds, the ordinary Gifts, <Q>However real and certain in them&s;elves, are no otherwi&s;e di&s;cernible, than by their Fruits and Effects.</Q> Had your Lord&s;hip &s;aid, No otherwi&s;e di&s;cernible to <HI>others,</HI> than by their Fruits and Effects&punc; it would have been right. But if your Lord&s;hip means they are no other|wi&s;e di&s;cernible to our&s;elves, in my Opinion it is wrong; for it is po&s;&s;ible, my Lord, for a Per|&s;on to feel and di&s;cern the&s;e ordinary Gifts and Influences of the Spirit in <HI>him&s;elf,</HI> when there is no Opportunity of di&s;covering them to others. For in&s;tance, on Suppo&s;ition that your Lord&s;hip was a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the ble&s;&s;ed Spirit, in writing your Pa&s;toral Letter&mdash;might not your Lord&s;hip be &s;en&s;ible of an inward Joy and Complacency, wrought by that felt &s;ame Spirit, which was not then di&s;cernible to others? So likewi&s;e it is po&s;|&s;ible for another to feel Joy in the Holy Gho&s;t,
<PB N="9" REF="004457_0006_100D841E5D691D20">
with the re&s;t of his Fruits, which at that Time may not be di&s;cernible to others; and which they who have never experienced the like, may not believe, though a Man d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> unto them. I hope, my Lord, the&s;e R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;onings carry with them their own Evidence.</P>
<P>But to proceed: (<HI>Page</HI> 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25&punc;) your Lord&s;hip has taken Pains to collect &s;everal Pa&s;&s;ages out of the publick Liturgy, to prove the Doctrine of Regeneration or our New Birth, to be the Doctrine of the Church of <HI>Eng|land.</HI> Your Rea&s;on for &s;o doing, appears (<HI>Page</HI> 25.) <Q>to arm your People again&s;t any Sug|ge&s;tions, as if our Church were regardle&s;s of the Doctrine of <HI>Regeneration</HI> and <HI>New Birth,</HI> as if there were Need for any Member of it, to &s;eek el&s;ewhere for a more <HI>Spiritual</HI> Service.</Q> If this, my Lord, was intended to arm your People again&s;t any &s;uch Sugge&s;tions made by <HI>me;</HI> indeed, your Lord&s;hip does not do me Ju&s;|tice. As your Lord&s;hip, I find, has done me the Honour, to peru&s;e my third Journal, your Lord&s;hip may remember this Ob&s;ervation, (<HI>Page</HI> 39) that, after I had baptized an Adult, I proved the Nece&s;&s;ity of the New Birth, from the Office of our Church.</P>
<P>In my Sermon, upon the <HI>Indwelling of the Spi|rit of God,</HI> which I have made bol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">nd your Lord&s;hip with this Letter, you will find. I have quoted the Expre&s;&s;ions of our own Church Offi|ces, to prove the Doctrine of the New Birth, as
<PB N="10" REF="004457_0007_100D8420E701E6A0">
your Lord&s;hip does in your Pa&s;toral Letter. My con&s;tant Way of preaching is, fir&s;t, to prove my Propo&s;itions by Scripture, and then to illu|&s;trate them by the Ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters">s and Collects of the Church of <HI>England.</HI> Tho&s;e that have heard me, can witne&s;s, how often I have exhorted them to he con&s;tnat at the Publick Service of the Church. I attend on it my &s;elf, and would read the Publick Liturgy every Day, if your Lord&s;hip's Clergy would give me Leave. What further Satisfaction can your Lord&s;hip require, that I do not &s;ugge&s;t to your Lord&s;hip's People, <Q>as if our Church were regardle&s;s of the Doc|trine of <HI>Regeneration</HI> and <HI>New Birth,</HI> and as if there were Need for any Member of it, to &s;eek el&s;e|where for a more <HI>Spiritual</HI> Service.</Q></P>
<P>In the following Paragragh, your Lord&s;hip has the &s;ame In&s;inuation, as though I wanted to introduce Extempore Prayer, and to lay a&s;ide the publick Liturgy of our Church. For after your Lord&s;hip had been &s;peaking again&s;t praying by the Spirit, and affirming that the Scripture no where tells us, that Prayer is the <HI>&s;ingle Work</HI> of the <HI>Spirit,</HI> your Lord&s;hip &s;ays to your People, <Q>You have great Rea&s;on to be thankful to <HI>God,</HI> for a publick Service prepared to your Hands.</Q> My Lord, I never &s;aid to the Contrary. But does not your Lord&s;hip &s;eem to in&s;inuate at the &s;ame Time, that we are not to depend on the Spirit of <HI>God</HI> to enable us to pray extempore, either in Publick, or private? That Prayer is not the <HI>&s;ingle
<PB N="11" REF="004457_0007_100D8420E701E6A0">
Work</HI> of the <HI>Spirit,</HI> without any Co-operation of our own, I readily confe&s;s. But that the Spirit of <HI>God</HI> does a&s;&s;i&s;t true Chri&s;tians to pray extem|pore, now, as well as formerly, is undeniable, if the Scriptures be true. For what &s;ays the Apo&s;tle? <HI>We know not what to pray for, as we ought, but the Spirit it &s;elf helpeth our Infirmities, and maketh Interce&s;&s;ion for us with Groanings, that cannot be utter|ed.</HI> And this is founded upon a general Promi&s;e, made to all <HI>God'</HI>s People. <HI>Zacharias</HI> 12. 10, <HI>I will pour upon the Hou&s;e of</HI> David, <HI>and upon the Inha|bitants of</HI> Jeru&s;alem, <HI>the Spirit of Grace, and of Sup|plication.</HI> And I believe, my Lord, we may ap|peal to the Experience of all true Chri&s;tians, whether or no they did not find the <HI>spirit of Supplication,</HI> or a Power of praying without a Form, encrea&s;e in Proportion to the Encrea&s;e of <HI>God'</HI>s Grace or Holy Spirit in their Hearts. This is all, my Lord, that I pretend to: And where is the Impropriety of this, when your Lord&s;hip confe&s;&s;es in the &s;ame Page, that the <Q>Spirit of <HI>God</HI> does particularly a&s;&s;i&s;t us, in a due Perfor|mance of Religious Offices?</Q></P>
<P>Farther, as your Lord&s;hip &s;eems to deny the immediate A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Holy Spirit in our particular Addre&s;&s;es at the Throne of Grace, &s;o your Lord&s;hip &s;eems to deny it al&s;o in our par|ticular Actions. <Q>In like Manner, your Lord|&s;hip &s;ays, we are firmly per&s;uaded in <HI>general,</HI> that we live under the gracious Influence of <HI>God'</HI>s <HI>Holy Spirit,</HI> and that he both excites and enables
<PB N="12" REF="004457_0008_100D8423572AAA00">
us to do Good. But that this or that <HI>Thought</HI> or <HI>Action</HI> is an Effect of the &s;ole Motion, or im|mediate Impul&s;e of the Spirit, without any Co-operation of our own Mind;</Q> (My Lord, who ever affirmed, that there was no Co-operation of our own Minds, together with the Impul&s;e of the Spirt of God? Your Lord&s;hip adds, <Q>Or that the Holy Spirit, and our natural Concep|tions, do re&s;pectively contribute to this or that Thought or Action, in &s;uch a Mea&s;ure or to &s;uch a Degree; the&s;e are Things we dare not &s;ay.</Q> Indeed my Lord I <HI>dare &s;ay them.</HI> For if there be any &s;uch Thing as a Particular Provi|dence, why may we not expect particular Direc|tion from <HI>God's</HI> Holy Spirit in a particular Ca&s;es? Does not our Church, my Lord&punc; teach us to pray, that <HI>God'</HI>s Holy Spirit may in all Things direct and rule our Hearts? But your Lord&s;hip &s;ays, we dare not &s;ay this, becau&s;e our Saviour has told us, that we know no more of the working of the Spirit, than we know of the Wind, <HI>from whence it cometh, and whither it goeth.</HI> Neither need we know any more of them: But you mu&s;t allow, that we know <HI>as much.</HI> Cannot your Lord&s;hip feel the Wind then? Does not your Lord&s;hip know when it makes any Impre&s;&s;ion upon your Body? So ea&s;y it is for a Spiritual Man to know when the Holy Spirit makes an Impre&s;&s;ion upon his Soul.
