<P>BEING fully and generally admitted, it nece&s;&s;arily follows, that well drawn character|i&s;tic pictures of life, though fabulous, are a commendable and profitable branch of literary compo&s;ition; as they prepare an attentive, in|telligent reader for &s;cenes of real action; and if the &s;uper&s;tructure be rai&s;ed from a moral foundation; without which, however beautiful the component parts, it mu&s;t fall before the breath of rational critici&s;m; then, while it de|lights the imagination, it improves both the head and heart; a large majority, e&s;pecially of the fair &s;ex, have not time nor talents for the inve&s;tigation of ab&s;tract principles in moral and &s;ocial life; wherefore a lighter kind of &s;tudy is e&s;&s;ential; and even the greate&s;t pro&s;elytes of pro|found &s;peculation, may unbend their minds, by peru&s;al of a well pen'd novel, both with plea&s;ure and advantage; &s;everal of this tendency might be pointed out, were they not already general|ly known and acknowledged.

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>SIR HENRY SUMMERS was a man by nature form|ed &s;en&s;ible, open, and compa&s;&s;ionate to the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of his fellow creatures, which he never looked on with|out pitying, nor was pity all he be&s;towed; he too well knew the pain which that pa&s;&s;ion mu&s;t give a feeling mind (when unaccompanied by a&s;&s;i&s;tance) ever to refu&s;e his, to merit in di&s;tre&s;s. By art his natural &s;en&s;e was refined into wi&s;dom, and his own genero&s;ity of &s;entiment gave him a humane politene&s;s of behaviour, which gained him univer&s;al re&s;pect. By fortune he was ble&s;&s;ed with an ample &s;ufficiency to indulge eve|ry benevolent wi&s;h of his expanded mind; luxurious or whim&s;ical &s;uperfluity never rendered him incapable of a&s;&s;i&s;ting unhou&s;ed poverty. In &s;hort, he only regard|ed his riches as they gave him an opportunity of con|tributing to the &s;upport of de&s;erving or nece&s;&s;itous objects.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="032122_0006_0FF138A6491BFC48">
While his character was re&s;pected even by tho&s;e who were not per&s;onally acquainted with him, his be|haviour created admiration and affection in all who were.</P>
<P>In friend&s;hip he was &s;incere, con&s;tant in danger, and patient in adver&s;ity, which he more than once had felt. To the&s;e qualifications he had joined the excel|lent addre&s;s of living (which is mo&s;t hard to do) with|out reproach. Yet, notwith&s;tanding he was thus en|dowed with every virtue that can truely form the ami|able, generous, hone&s;t man; he had, in common with all human kind, his particularities; but they were &s;uch as rather to be the objects of applau&s;e than cen&s;ure: His prai&s;es were too con&s;tant in the mouth of every one not to reach his own ear, and being well convinced of the &s;olidity of his judgment, he expect|ed a due deference to be paid thereto by all who had the lea&s;t dependance on, or connexion with him; he had a plea&s;ing dignity of countenance, which rend|ered him at once the object of e&s;teem and reverence; there was a little tincture of warmth and &s;elf-&s;uffici|ency in his di&s;po&s;ition, which made him rather impa|tient of controul: yet, after what I have &s;aid of this gentleman, there requires no great &s;agacity to di&s;co|ver, that what all allowed to be his virtues, far out|weighed what &s;ome cho&s;e to call his faults.</P>
<P>Sir Harry, &s;o early as eighteen, had contracted an acquaintance with a young lady of fortune, which, in a &s;hort time, grew into the mo&s;t di&s;intere&s;ted love; and
<PB N="3" REF="032122_0007_0FF138AA162E2578">
being a man of too much &s;en&s;ibility ever to think of her on any other than honourable terms, he con&s;ulted her father, who cruelly rejected his propo&s;als, not from any di&s;like to his per&s;on, family, or fortune, which were all unexceptionable, but on account of his youth; partially imagining, that he could not be endowed with &s;o much &s;olidity, as to fix the volatile, wandering affections at &s;o early a period of life, upon one object, however valuable; therefore con&s;i|dered his pa&s;&s;ion but as a flight of incon&s;iderate youth, which, in a &s;hort time after the accompli&s;hment of his wi&s;hes, would naturally wear off: thus, through an over-refined degree of caution, the anxious father oppo&s;ed the only &s;tep which could in&s;ure his daugh|ter's happine&s;s. Thus it often happens in life, that by earne&s;tly endeavouring to avoid one error, we in|evitably fall into its oppo&s;ite.</P>
<P>This refu&s;al, of cour&s;e, put a &s;top to the frequent interviews with which the young couple had before found means to indulge them&s;elves; yet, notwith|&s;tanding it deprived them of the few &s;weet minutes per&s;onal conferences afforded, they, lover like, in|du&s;triou&s;ly found means to hear con&s;tantly from each other; two of which letters I here pre&s;ent to my readers. The fir&s;t, which is from Sir Harry, was wrote the day after he received the refu&s;al from her father.</P>

<P>WHAT words, mo&s;t dear Amelia, can expre&s;s my feelings at this juncture?

Yet, though I am fully con&s;cious of your flattering &s;entiments, allow me to feel.&mdash;Your own delicate mind will do me the ju&s;tice to &s;ugge&s;t, how far a thought of lo&s;ing you mu&s;t affect me: let me avoid it, le&s;t I &s;ink beneath a painful weight of appre|hen&s;ion.&mdash;Yet, can I be thus divided from you, and loo&s;e the thought of what I &s;hould feel from an eter|nal

<P>MANY more letters pa&s;&s;ed between Sir Harry and his AEmily; but as mo&s;t of them only contained the &s;ame a&s;&s;urances of regard in other words, and as love letters, no more than love &s;cenes, are amu&s;ing to any but the parties concerned, I &s;hall not trouble my readers with any more than the&s;e two, which may &s;erve as a &s;pecimen of the &s;tile and contents of all the others. Let it &s;uffice to &s;ay, that Sir Harry having made another application to her father, and having received the &s;ame refu&s;al, our lovers determined to make a &s;tolen match; which being effected, Sir Har|ry would have thrown him&s;elf at his wife's father's feet, but the old gentleman ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed to &s;ee either of them, taking this imprudent &s;tep too nearly to heart, it in a &s;hort time fini&s;hed his days; nor could he ever be prevailed upon to &s;ee his daughter, but ob|&s;tinately carried his re&s;entment to the grave, as a proof of which, he bequeathed all he was worth to a di&s;tant relation of his wife's. This accident happening when Lady Summers was pregnant, a mi&s;carriage was the con&s;equence, followed by a violent fever, which in a few days put an end to her life: and thus
<PB N="8" REF="032122_0012_0FF138B78B380648">
was Sir Harry left a widower at the age of twenty-two, as a mourning monument of the fatal effects of filial di&s;obedience.</P>
<P>So quick and &s;o impre&s;&s;ing a &s;eries of misfortunes ca&s;t a gloom upon his countenance, which it was not in the power of time to remove, any more than the &s;ettled re&s;olution he made, on his wife's death, of never entering again into that &s;tate, wherein he had been &s;o unlucky in his fir&s;t attempt. He there|fore lived, as I before &s;aid, the object of every one's admiration and e&s;teem, &s;triving to do all the good in his power. He partook of all the plea&s;ures of life, without running into any of the ab&s;urdities; he was more delighted with amu&s;ements he met with at his &s;eat in York&s;hire, as being the more rational, yet when in town, as he was half the year, he frequent|ed every public place of diver&s;ion, to avoid the char|acter of a mi&s;anthrope, which, from his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ettled me|lancholy, &s;ome few officious people had cho&s;e to honour him with. He was about the age of forty, when the following affair happened.</P>
<P>Early one morning in February, when on his re|turn from Carli&s;le-Hou&s;e, he was &s;urprized by &s;eeing a croud of watchmen round his door, occa&s;ioned, as he di&s;covered on enquiry, by a ba&s;ket ju&s;t then picked up, which, to his great a&s;toni&s;hment, was found to contain a female child, of (&s;eemingly) about a month old. On his nearer approach, he ob&s;erved
<PB N="9" REF="032122_0013_0FF138BE4A688918">
a paper pinned to its brea&s;t, on which were wrote, in a neat Italian hand, the&s;e words:</P>
<P><HI>"Stranger, who&s;oe'er thou art, that find'&s;t this luckle&s;s babe, &s;hut not your ears again&s;t the tender cries of youthful innocence, but pity, cheri&s;h, and re|ceive her; in return for which &s;he will far o'erpay your generous care by her endearing prattle."</HI></P>
<P>This was &s;o forcible an application to the humani|ty of Sir Harry (than whom no man had a greater &s;hare) that he could not with&s;tand the natural im|pul&s;e of his heart, but ordered the child to be con|veyed into his hou&s;e, and to have all immediate care taken of it.&mdash;Thus to a heart &s;o &s;u&s;ceptible of tender|ne&s;s, the&s;e few words pleaded the cau&s;e of this help|le&s;s infant, in full as effectual a manner, and perhaps with more &s;ucce&s;s, than whole volumes on the &s;ub|ject, from the able&s;t hands, could have done.</P>
<P>So &s;ingular an adventure employed Sir Harry's thoughts great part of that time which he would otherwi&s;e have appropriated to re&s;t; but this cir|cum&s;tance, the more he con&s;idered it, the more it bewildered his ideas; in &s;hort, it was an endle&s;s maze of perplexities. He could not believe tho&s;e lines to be the produce of any common hand, either from the &s;tile or writing, nor did he know any one on whom to fix his &s;u&s;picions: however, after &s;ome he&s;itation he yielded fully to the humane dictates of
<PB N="10" REF="032122_0014_0FF138C0F63C8580">
his heart, by re&s;olving to furni&s;h the child with every nece&s;&s;ary, and, as &s;he turned out, to fix her in the world. This re&s;olution afforded him the tacit prai&s;e of what he had determined; nor was he a little &s;trengthened in his de&s;ign by the affecting &s;miles which &s;at upon the infant's countenance, when he went to inquire after it, and give orders for her nur|&s;ery. He was ju&s;t &s;at down to breakfa&s;t, when Mr. Modi&s;h entered the room, to inquire after the com|pany he had &s;een at Carli&s;le-hou&s;e the preceeding evening.</P>

<P>MR. Modi&s;h was a gentleman of fortune, by na|ture endowed with a good under&s;tanding, but unhap|pily much over-run with the weed of inattention.&mdash;He was a di&s;tant relation to Sir Harry's who having a real regard for him, with pain ob&s;erved the ridicu|lous circum&s;tances of his behaviour, which he al|ways, like a true friend, endeavoured to amend by admoni&s;hment, wherever he &s;aw occa&s;ion. Sir Har|ry's mind was &s;o full of the la&s;t night's adventure, that the fir&s;t compliments were &s;carce pa&s;&s;ed, when be told the whole affair to Modi&s;h, who having heard him to the end with great attention, taking his hand with a triumphant laugh. replied:&mdash;"Sir Harry, I

I really began to fear, we were all reverting to the antideluvian &s;tate, when an amour was looked upon as a crime. You know, I in particular was never fond of tho&s;e primaeval notions, and always thought you rather too much addicted to them.&mdash;Well! and pray&mdash;Now, what happy girl has had the honour of converting you to my way of thinking? What&mdash;it is a &s;ecret, I &s;uppo&s;e.&mdash;She bid you not ki&s;s and tell, ha! Sir Harry?&mdash;'G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">d, I began to give you up for an ob&s;tinate heretic, in whom it was impo&s;&s;ible to work a reformation. Well&mdash;I &s;up|po&s;e it is to be &s;ent to nur&s;e in the country to a ten|ant's wife, who was formerly your hou&s;e-keeper; and when he is about twelve years old, brought to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">own as the &s;on of a poor clergyman, for whom you have a great regard; then a few years &s;chooling, and a cornetcy in the guards, fini&s;hes the whole affair.&mdash;Well, upon my &s;oul! you are a happy fellow, who have no check upon your plea&s;ures from a deficiency in your pur&s;e."&mdash;This gentleman's volubility of tongue was &s;o great, that Sir Harry was obliged to let him run on thus far, before he could convince him of his mi&s;take with regard to the &s;ex of the child, and which he had before forgot to inform him of;&mdash;but when he heard it was a girl, after near a min|ute's pau&s;e, he cried,&mdash;"A girl! that's unlucky; however, we mu&s;t make the be&s;t of a bad bargain.&mdash;
<PB N="12" REF="032122_0016_0FF138C4EF5C2D10">
Why, &s;he mu&s;t of cour&s;e, be nur&s;ed in the country; and then bring her to London as your ward, the on|ly daughter of a particular friend who died in the We&s;t Indies:&mdash;ay, ay, that will do:&mdash;and then a couple of thou&s;and pounds, or &s;o, may make her the wife of &s;ome hone&s;t citizen, who has more mo|ney than wit."&mdash;In vain did he prote&s;t the child was not his own: Modi&s;h could not believe, that any man would thus adopt a perfect &s;tranger to him: however, on Sir Harry's firm prote&s;tations, he be|gan to have rather a different opinion:&mdash;Well, (&s;ays he) if the child is not your's, I think you did wrong to take any notice a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> her.&mdash;For my own part, it is a &s;ettled rule with me, to provide for no man's off|&s;pring but my own, and not even them at all times."

<P>THE con&s;equence of the conver&s;ation which Sir Harry had with Modi&s;h, as related in the la&s;t chap|ter, was an immediate application of his time to the preparation of every thing which might conduce to the ea&s;e and happine&s;s of his adopted child, whom he now determined to educate in London, that he might not &s;eem to pay any attention to the many ill-natured in&s;inuations which he con&s;tantly heard, and &s;till expected to hear, about &s;o extraordinary an af|fair, from the major part of the world. However, equally regardle&s;s of their cen&s;ure or their prai&s;e, he &s;till nobly per&s;evered in the execution of his fir&s;t de|&s;ign, with regard to the education of that child, whom in memory of his once dear partner, he had chri&s;tened by the name of AEmily, and who<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e benig|nant &s;miles, whenever he approached, he con&s;idered as &s;o many grateful returns for his humanity, in the pre&s;ervation of her life.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="032122_0021_0FF138DA90321288">
As &s;oon as her tender mind was adjudged capable of retaining any impre&s;&s;ions, he prepared ma&s;ters to in&s;truct her in every thing &s;uiting her age and &s;ex, which &s;he took fa&s;t as 'twas mini&s;ter'd; and he had &s;oon the &s;atisfaction of hearing her, in unaffected &s;trains, expre&s;s her thanks for the many favours he daily be&s;towed on her, and which never failed to put him in mind of tho&s;e remarkable words, which the reader may remember were found upon her brea&s;t. He was in &s;ome doubt whether to acquaint her with this circum&s;tance or not; but judging that a di&s;cov|ery of that nature might, from the genero&s;ity and laudable pride of her mind, when &s;he con&s;idered her&s;elf as an object of charity, occa&s;ion a re&s;erve in her behaviour, which would deprive him of the plea&s;ure of her open and ingenious conver&s;ation, he cho&s;e, rather than run this hazard, to impo&s;e upon her by an information that &s;he was his niece; and as he always made a di&s;tinction between a fal&s;ity, con|trived with a premeditated de&s;ign to do an injury, and one with an innocent intention, he had on this occa&s;ion no other feelings, than tho&s;e which con|&s;cious virtue always experiences on the performance of any good action. However that &s;he might not always remain a &s;tranger to what &s;o nearly concern|ed her, he wrote an account thereof, which with the paper abovementioned, being inclo&s;ed in his will, were committed into the hands of his attorney.</P>
<P>AEmily was now endowed with a per&s;on far from contemptible; but having affairs of much more con|&s;equence
<PB N="18" REF="032122_0022_0FF138DD8CAE5A68">
to take notice of, I &s;hall not detain my read|ers with a minute account of tho&s;e qualifications which can reflect no honour on her noble parts, be|ing qualifications, if they de&s;erve that name, which every woman is equally liable to po&s;&s;e&s;s in as emminent a degree as her&s;elf; but to her honour be it &s;poken, that, added to ageeable external endow|ments, &s;he had a mind replete with every amiable virtue.</P>
<P>Sir Harry now con&s;idering her in every re&s;pect as his niece, accompanied her to all places of public entertainment; but &s;he was far too &s;en&s;ible, to re|ceive any &s;olid &s;atisfaction from the enjoyment of any of the pre&s;ent modi&s;h diver&s;ions, except the The|atre, which &s;he con&s;idered as not only proper for refining our &s;entiments and ideas, but as the mo&s;t luxurious treat the human under&s;tanding is capable of enjoying. No wonder then, that &s;he was an al|mo&s;t con&s;tant attendant there, e&s;pecially when per|formances of an edifying ca&s;t were exhibited.</P>
<P>The re&s;idence of her uncle (that being the light in which &s;he now con&s;idered Sir Harry) in York&s;hire, during the &s;ummer &s;ea&s;on, to which place &s;he always accompanied him, gave her a full opportunity of pur|&s;uing her favourite amu&s;ements, reading and walk|ing; in the latter of which &s;he found an additional plea&s;ure, being generally accompanied by a neigh|bouring young lady, for whom &s;he had the &s;incere&s;t

affection that a &s;imilarity of &s;entiment could promote; nor was her generous friend&s;hip placed on an unde|&s;erving object; &s;he had the happine&s;s of having it returned with additional ardor. To this young la|dy, who was the daughter of Sir Thomas Hartry, AEmily opened her whole heart, on every occa&s;ion, with all the ingenuity of di&s;intere&s;ted regard. She had ju&s;t attained her twentieth year, when an affair, which the reader will &s;oon become acquainted with gave ri&s;e to the following letters from AEmily to her friend.</P>

<P>The appearance of Garrick in tragedy, &s;ome time <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, induced my uncle, at my reque&s;t, to take places <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> that evening; and although he was indi&s;po&s;ed all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> morning with a violent head-ache <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">in &s;pite of my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">mon&s;trances in&s;i&s;ted on performing his promi&s;e, by attending me to the play in the evening; &s;o far does <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> is good man, in every thing, prefer my happine&s;s <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> his own ea&s;e. As it was a crouded night, we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> not to &s;tay the farce, and ordered the carriage accordingly. We had not been long &s;eated in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ox, before Mi&s;s Martin, with whom I have a &s;light acquaintance, &s;eated her&s;elf behind us being attended by her brother, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> young gentleman of &s;mall private fortune, who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> his winter been called to the bar, where he promi&s;es fair to make a figure: but although no one applies more clo&s;ely to his profe&s;&s;ion, when out of it, he is quite the gentleman, which character very few know, how &s;o well to unite with the man of bu&s;ine&s;s. Finding I was no &s;tranger to his &s;i&s;ter, from his fir&s;t entrance, he directed his conver&s;ation parti|cularly to me; but being the only woman in compa|ny, except her (and &s;i&s;ters, you know, are nobody) I only thought it what every man would have done in the &s;ame ca&s;e, and therefore, at that time, con&s;ider|ed
<PB N="21" REF="032122_0025_0FF138E82FAB8590">
it in no other light than as common civility. Our di&s;cour&s;e naturally turning upon the exhibition be|fore us, the ju&s;tice of his remarks added to the appa|rent diffidence with which they were uttered, gave me as high an opinion of his judgment as I had of his addre&s;s and per&s;onal behaviour. Added to the&s;e, he is furni&s;hed with a mind &s;u&s;ceptible of the mo&s;t delicate feelings; for, would you think it, my dear? he was even unfa&s;hionable enough to weep at the imaginary repre&s;entation of di&s;tre&s;s: as if a&s;hamed of his weakne&s;s, he for &s;ome time endeavoured to con|ceal the emotions of his foul; but in vain: nature got the better of art, and &s;hewed the unaffected good|ne&s;s of his heart in its true colours. I do not know whether it was from &s;ympathy, but I never was more affected at a tragedy in my life: he perceived it, and I had the &s;atisfaction of being complimented by him on the tenderne&s;s of my pa&s;&s;ions. Surely this man knows my very thoughts, for he did not once &s;eem to pay the lea&s;t attention to my per&s;on: if he has any de&s;ign upon my affections, this is his only way. Your Emmy would hold that man unworthy a place in her heart, who could be captivated by her per&s;on only; &s;uch love can have no &s;tability; every day will &s;hew new beauties to his eyes, each of whom will blot the remembrance of the former from his heart; and thus admiring all, he really regards none. But a man, who prefers us for &s;ome &s;uperior excellence of mind, will, when in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of our per&s;ons, have daily opportunities of &s;eeing the improvement of the for|mer:
<PB N="22" REF="032122_0026_0FF138EB4F3D8128">
and thus with love and rea&s;on both combined, we &s;pread a toil too dear for him to break. How cau|tious, then, how very cautious &s;hould we be, not to fix our affections on a man, who probably may abu&s;e the confidence we place in him. When the indi&s;&s;o|luble knot is tied, we are no longer pre&s;erved under the fo&s;tering wing of an indulgent parent, friends and relations, all give up the joint care they have had of our happine&s;s, and center it alone in the will of a hu&s;band: to him we mu&s;t on all occa&s;ions fly for a&s;|&s;i&s;tance, which if he refu&s;es, we indeed are mi&s;erable.</P>

<P>But my zeal for the happine&s;s of the re&s;t of my &s;ex, has almo&s;t made me forget to proceed in my &s;tory.</P>
<P>At the conclu&s;ion of the play, my uncle went out to enquire after the carriage, promi&s;ing to return immediately: but after having waited &s;ome time, you may imagine how amazed I was to &s;ee nothing of him, nor could I help expre&s;&s;ing my a&s;toni&s;hment thereat to Mi&s;s Martin, who as well as her brother, &s;trove with all the tender concern they could to quiet my fears; but in vain. During the whole time of the entertainment, I was agitated with the mo&s;t dreadful apprehen&s;ions, in&s;omuch that the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> had dropt &s;ometime before I di&s;covered it.&mdash;In this dilemma, Mr. Martin in&s;i&s;ted on &s;etting me down, which, in &s;uch a &s;ituation, I could not refu&s;e; he therefore handed me into the pa&s;&s;age, where the croud was too great for us to proceed, and his eager|ne&s;s
<PB N="25" REF="032122_0029_0FF138F4EF251780">
to extricate us from this difficulty led him &s;o far, that by &s;ome accident, a chairman in &s;hifting one of his poles let it fall upon his head, from whence the blood immediately gu&s;hed in a great quantity. You may more ea&s;ily imagine, than I can de&s;cribe, the con&s;ternation this threw both his &s;i&s;ter and me into, our fears interpreting the danger to be greater than it really was, which, he a&s;&s;ured us, was very trifling, and notwith&s;tanding our mo&s;t earne&s;t entrea|ties, could not be prevailed on to accept of any a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance till he got home: but turning to his &s;i&s;ter, de|&s;ired &s;he would lend him her handkerchief, &s;omebo|dy in the croud having been civil enough to borrow his; but I being the quicker of the two (and, I am afraid, almo&s;t as much concerned for his &s;afety) be|fore &s;he could find her's, had offered him mine, which he politely accepted; and having bound it round his head, with &s;ome difficulty &s;eated us in the coach.</P>
<P>On our arrival at Albermarle-&s;treet, I enquired after my uncle, and had the &s;atisfaction of hearing that he had been taken ill, on the &s;udden change from &s;o inten&s;e heat to cold; but that, to my heart|felt ea&s;e, he was again recovered, and had arrived ju&s;t before me. On hearing this, Mr. Martin beg|ged leave to enquire after his health, the next day: which I could not refu&s;e, but de&s;ired that he would not, out of complai&s;ance to enquire after the &s;afety of others endanger his own, by coming out too &s;oon; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">

The compo&s;ure I had always hitherto felt, on repair|ing to re&s;t, was gone, and in its room had left ten thou&s;and doubts and fears.&mdash;According to my cu&s;t|om, upon a &s;trict examination into my actions of the day, I found in my heart &s;en&s;ations which I dared not give way to, nor could totally &s;uppre&s;s: in &s;hort, I found my happine&s;s depended on the actions of a man who never (and what was wor&s;e) who perhaps never intended to &s;peak to me on any other footing than that of a common acquaintance. Shall I confe&s;s to you, that this thought affected me &s;o far as to hinder me from taking my natural re&s;t? I therefore ro&s;e i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> the morning, pale, and unrefre&s;hed, my u&s;ual &s;pright|line&s;s
<PB N="28" REF="032122_0032_0FF138FF099C5B90">
&s;upplanted by a melancholy dejection, almo&s;t too much for me to bear. My uncle perceived it, and with a paternal kindne&s;s, tenderly enquired the cau&s;e. To acknowledge the real one was impo&s;&s;i|ble the fictitious confe&s;&s;ion of having been troubled with the toothach all night, delivered me from that confu&s;ion which his que&s;tion had thrown me into; but you may imagine that I did not feel much ea&s;ier, when after a moment's recollection, my con&s;cience dictated to me, to what the entertainment of an im|prudent pa&s;&s;ion had reduced your friend; the wilful deception of a man &s;o kind, &s;o generous, that hither|to he had always &s;trove to intercept my wi&s;hes, that I might never know what it was to a&s;k a favour.&mdash;Oh! my Maria!&mdash;to what does this love &s;ubject us! how far does it deba&s;e the genero&s;ity of our minds beneath its glorious &s;phere!&mdash;At our births, by na|ture we are open, ingenuous, and &s;incere; our youth|ful hearts can entertain no thought, no wi&s;h, which we de&s;ire to exclude the brea&s;t of any one acquaint|ance.</P>
<P>I was meditating on the fallacious influence of un|authorized concealed love, when, according to my expectation, the &s;ervant announced Mr. Martins approach. This &s;ound at once rou&s;ed me from my reveries, and gave me &s;pirits to receive him in as di&s;|engaged a manner as the nature of our acquaintance would admit of. I was &s;orry to ob&s;erve, that his
<PB N="29" REF="032122_0033_0FF13901DD2FF068">
dre&s;s (con&s;idering the time of day) was &s;tudiou&s;ly elegant. I am afraid he has either too much of the coxcomb in him, or a wor&s;e opinion of my under|&s;tanding than I could wi&s;h; as his appearance &s;eemed to indicate, that he thinks me capable of receiving an impre&s;&s;ion from his exterior parts. From your thorough knowledge of my heart, you be&s;t can tell how much he is mi&s;taken: and here, methinks you will call me a whim&s;ical girl, for troubling my head &s;o much about a man, whom as yet I had never &s;een but once.&mdash;Why, that indeed is very true; but in that once, his eyes as plainly &s;poke the language of his &s;oul, as if he had told me that he loved; for, in his whole behaviour, there was a delicate attention to my every word, which was more per&s;ua&s;ive elo|quence than any he could u&s;e.</P>
<P>Some few compliments had pa&s;&s;ed between us, when my uncle entered the room, to whom I intro|duced Mr. Martin, as the gentleman to whom I was &s;o much obliged for his a&s;&s;i&s;tance the preceeding evening. With his u&s;ual politene&s;s, he made him many acknowledgments for his behaviour, and in a &s;hort time, in&s;en&s;ibly fell into a conver&s;ation, which &s;eemed to promi&s;e an intimacy; nor was I mi&s;taken in my conjectures; a general invitation to Alber|marle-&s;treet was the con&s;equence, at which I will confe&s;s, I was not a little plea&s;ed; and, in order to &s;trengthen this growing connexion, I &s;ent by him a me&s;&s;age to his &s;i&s;ter, intimating that I &s;hould be

proud of a &s;tricter acquaintance with her: after which he took his leave, not without fir&s;t having made a very &s;ignificant bow to me;&mdash;at lea&s;t my va|nity con&s;trued it as &s;uch.</P>
<P>You may imagine he did not neglect the invita|tion he had received: few days pa&s;&s;ed in which we did not &s;ee him; and my uncle in a &s;hort time con|ceived &s;o cordial a fondne&s;s for him, that he &s;carce|ly ever &s;eemed to have enough of his company; he was one in all our parties at home, and a tended us to every public place; and though he did not pay me the common compliments which mo&s;t of his &s;ex u&s;e to our's, &s;till there was a certain delicacy in ev|ery <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, which too plainly a&s;&s;ured me, that he re|garded me with other eyes than tho&s;e of a more ac|quaintance: and I will acknowledge, that I daily ex|pected a declaration of his pa&s;&s;ion, nay, that I even wi&s;h'd it, though I was not without my fears, le&s;t my uncle, on account of the &s;mallne&s;s of his fortune &s;hould oppo&s;e his inclinations, and thereby deprive me of his company, which I now enjoyed with un|limited plea&s;ure.&mdash;Oh! my Maria!&mdash;what did I not &s;uffer from this apprehen&s;ion!&mdash;and as he grew eve|ry day more particular, every time I &s;aw him increa&s;|ed my unea&s;ine&s;s, till at length, what I &s;o long ex|pected, arrived: but I am &s;ummoned to my toilet, and therefore mu&s;t make this the &s;ubject of another <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">.

<P>WHEN once affection is rooted in the brea&s;t, hard is the ta&s;k to conceal the movements of our hearts from the dear object. I thus, my amiable friend, begin with a &s;entiment, becau&s;e I think the &s;equel of my &s;tory will pretty clearly exemplify it: I will therefore now re&s;ume the thread of my di&s;|cour&s;e, and endeavour to be a little more con&s;i&s;tent than in my la&s;t; but as I was at that time in an unu|&s;ual flutter of &s;pirits, I am &s;ure you will pardon me.</P>
<P>The morning preceding to my writing it, I was lolling negligently on a &s;ettee, peru&s;ing your letter, when Mr. Martin, entering the room &s;uddenly, un|heard and unexpected, threw me into &s;ome lit|tle confu&s;ion, and in my hurry I dropt your epi&s;tle on the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> which if you remember, was directed by your father: he immediately picked it up, and
<PB N="32" REF="032122_0036_0FF1390E2268AF70">
perceived the &s;uper&s;cription to be a man's hand: after a &s;hort &s;ilence, during which various pa&s;&s;ions by turns appeared in his face. "How happy, Mad|am, &s;aid he, mu&s;t that gentleman be, who can &s;o far have acquired your e&s;teem, as to be permitted to corre&s;pond with you!"&mdash;Having &s;o &s;aid, he held it in his hand, as if waiting for an an&s;wer; but as I perceived a taint of jealou&s;y in his words and mode of expre&s;&s;ion, I endeavoured to evade the circum|&s;tance, by enquiring when I might hope to congratu|late him upon a perfect recovery of the accident he met at the Theatre, which &s;till clouded his counte|nance with a patch? Seeing through my artifice, he an&s;wered as follows; "You &s;eem, Mi&s;s Summers, to be extremely cautious of &s;aying any thing further on the letter:"&mdash;and, with a kind of forced irony, added, "I am &s;ure Mi&s;s Summer's principles would never &s;uffer her to hold a corre&s;pondence with any one of whom &s;he need be a&s;hamed."&mdash;Notwith|&s;tanding the &s;atisfaction I at that moment felt for hav|ing awakened the re&s;entment of that love I wi&s;hed to cultivate, to &s;upport the farce, I could not avoid replying, with an air of negligence, "I do not think my&s;elf obliged to con&s;ult all my acquaintance on the choice of my corre&s;pondents; and provided I have none with whom my uncle is di&s;plea&s;ed, I do not &s;ee that any other per&s;on has any concern in the af|fair."&mdash;Poor &s;oul! how engagingly &s;imple he look|ed!
<PB N="33" REF="032122_0037_0FF13911E83BC630">
&mdash;he hung his head, and with a timid he&s;itating inferiority, &s;aid, "To be &s;ure, Madam&mdash;as you &s;ay&mdash;I have no right&mdash;I once, indeed, added he with a &s;igh, flattered my&s;elf&mdash;but fool that I was&mdash;what rea&s;on had I to expect"&mdash;then with a low bow con|tinued, "as I acknowledge my tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, and &s;incerely beg your pardon, I hope Mi&s;s Summers will for once excu&s;e &s;o impertinent a curio&s;ity;&mdash;e&s;pecially as in palliation thereof, I can with truth a&s;&s;ure her, that I had &s;ome rea&s;on for my &s;eeming enquiry."&mdash;Well, &s;aid I, &s;ince you confe&s;s your fault, I will now convince you, that your &s;u&s;picions were groundle&s;s;&mdash;but ob&s;erve&mdash;I do this to ju&s;tify my&s;elf, not to &s;atisfy you."&mdash;So &s;aying, I produced the letter, and relating to him the real truth, &s;hewed him your name, at the &s;ight of which, his countenance immediately brightened up; and I will own to you that I felt an un&s;peakable plea&s;ure, when I &s;aw him under a pretence of a clo&s;er examination of the direction, pre&s;s my name to his lips with the greate&s;t eagerne&s;s; after which he returned me the letter, with as much compo&s;ure as if he was con|vinced I had not taken notice of his la&s;t action.</P>
<P>The conver&s;ation now dropp'd; but this being far from my intention [I am afraid out of the &s;ecret de&s;ire of urging him to a declaration] immediately took an opportunity of &s;aying, "I think Sir you told me, that you had a rea&s;on for your &s;eeming enquiry concerning the letter; &s;hall I not come under the

Perceiving therefore that I he&s;i|tated for an an&s;wer (for indeed I knew not what to &s;ay, he took one of my hands and with &s;ome warmth cry'd, "May I not deare&s;t Mi&s;s Summers, hope that by my earne&s;t endeavours to plea&s;e, I may at length render my&s;elf not totally di&s;agreeable to you."&mdash;And much more he then &s;aid than I can now remember: it is impo&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe the dilemma I was in; and to confe&s;s the truth, the moment was not a little cri|tical.

&mdash;A fine young fellow at my feet, u&s;ing all the rhetoric he was ma&s;ter of, to per&s;uade me to what before I had no &s;mall inclination (I mean the avow|al of my pa&s;&s;ion) was a dangerous &s;ituation:&mdash;Tell me, my Maria, was this a time for he&s;itation?&mdash;Tru&s;t me&mdash;No&mdash;And I really think that I had great prudence in avoiding a pre&s;ent return of his profe&s;|&s;ions; which I did by &s;aying, "It has always been my con&s;tant rule, and always &s;hall be, Sir, never to li&s;ten to any one on this &s;ubject, till I have my un|cle's &s;anction for &s;o doing; it is to him therefore you mu&s;t apply."&mdash;"By your referring me to Sir Harry, madam (replied he) I flatter my&s;elf that if I have his permi&s;&s;ion for the attempt, I may one day in&s;pire you with &s;entiments of tenderne&s;s."&mdash;Was not that pretty forward my dear?&mdash;However I was determined to puni&s;h him for his pre&s;umption; therefore with all the con&s;equence I could then a&s;|&s;ume, I replied, "You have drawn, Sir, a conclu&s;ion in your own favour which might as ea&s;ily be turn'd to your di&s;advantage; I mean, that you might take my reference of you to my uncle for an ab&s;olute de|nial; as I think, you may be pretty well convinced, that he will never be induced to give you his con|&s;ent."&mdash;"I under&s;tand you, Madam, &s;aid he, the difference of our fortunes and expectations; but I have too good an opinion of your genero&s;ity to think that alone could influence you, whatever it might Sir Harry; for which rea&s;on I rather cho&s;e to ap|ply

<P>INDEED, indeed, my deare&s;t AEmily, there's no bearing this: you are po&s;itively a horrid provoking girl: one minute you a&s;k my advice, and the next comes a letter, informing me that you have followed your own inclination, without waiting for my coun|&s;el: thus are all the fine things, which I had trea|&s;ured up to per&s;uade you to conquer your pa&s;&s;ion, thrown away, and rendered u&s;ele&s;s, by your precipi|tate conduct.

<P>Sir Thomas Hartry was a baronnet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a large e&s;tate in the country where he re&s;ided; which he inherited from a long train of ance&s;tors, who were all rendered remarkable by their extreme avarice: and though he did not po&s;&s;e&s;s this &s;hocking con|traction of heart in &s;o great a degree, &s;till he did not

totally degenerate from the maxim of his illu&s;trious forefathers. "Get money," was his favourite prin|ciple; and indeed this &s;eemed to be the aim of all his actions; notwith&s;tanding which, he was by no means totally callous to the feelings of humanity;&mdash;for, what was mo&s;t extraordinary, he could feel for the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of others; though he &s;eemed deaf to al|mo&s;t the common calls of nece&s;&s;ity for him&s;elf. Ever con&s;tant to his favourite notions, he married lady Hartry for two rea&s;ons; the one, becau&s;e &s;he had ten thou&s;and pounds; the other, in hopes of having an heir to his e&s;tate: and as this was almo&s;t his ulti|mate wi&s;h, one would imagine he mu&s;t be complete|ly happy, to find him&s;elf indulged with &s;uch a ble&s;&s;|ing, about a year after his marriage; and &s;uch a one who as he grew up, became the admiration of the whole country, for his &s;en&s;e and good nature; in &s;hort he &s;eem'd entirely clear from his father's faults, and to inherit the virtues only of both his parents; yet &s;uch is the unaccountable caprice of human nature, that though he was &s;o de&s;erving a &s;on, as almo&s;t to ex|ceed de&s;cription, he never was a favourite with his father; who, notwith&s;tanding, could a&s;&s;ign no rea&s;on for his di&s;like. Charles (that was his name) beheld it with concern, and endeavoured to gain his affec|tions by his a&s;&s;iduity; but this, in&s;tead of being taken in the favourable light, &s;erved only to heighten his father's di&s;gu&s;t: in &s;hort, nothing could plea&s;e him, and he at la&s;t drove him, by a cour&s;e of ill u&s;age, at

the age of eighteen, to &s;eek that happine&s;s among his neare&s;t relations. But behold the amazing caprice of mankind! who never knew how to &s;et a ju&s;t va|lue on a jewel till 'tis gone; that we cannot know how much we love, or what it is to want a friend till we have lo&s;t him was never more &s;trongly veri|fied that in this in&s;tance of Sir Thomas Hartry; who till this moment, never was aware of the real affec|tion which he had for his &s;on; his virtues now ap|peared with double force to the afflicted father, who in vain u&s;ed all po&s;&s;ible means to recover him; and when be found that he was gone for even, all the ten|der parent ri&s;ing into his eyes, quite ab&s;orb'd the man; and he for &s;ome time gave way to that &s;oft &s;orrow which overpowered his brea&s;t, and which he could not &s;uppre&s;s.</P>
<P>So &s;evere a blow had nearly been too much for Lady Hartry, who almo&s;t doated on her &s;on, regard|ing him with tho&s;e innate feelings which mothers only can be truly judges of. Time, however that great re&s;torer of all things, in &s;ome mea&s;ure allevi|ated the grief of both Sir Thomas and his lady; the former of whom, with the lo&s;s of his &s;on, &s;eem|ed totally to have abandoned his pa&s;&s;ion for money, and determined to make up in kindne&s;s what the &s;on had wanted, to his daughter Maria, who being ten years old when the above affair happened, could not, of cour&s;e be &s;uppo&s;ed to feel much affliction for the lo&s;s of her brother:&mdash;all that &s;he could, &s;he did.&mdash;
<PB N="46" REF="032122_0050_0FF139400947CF08">
As &s;he might now be reckoned an only child, no trouble, no expence, was &s;pared in the education of this darling of the family; and her fond parents were overjoyed to find their trouble and attention &s;o well repaid, as to behold her, at the age of eighteen, po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of every natural as well as acquired perfection, nece&s;&s;ary to complete the accompli&s;hed lady: her per&s;on was hand&s;ome to exce&s;s, rather &s;hort than otherwi&s;e; her carriage was genteel and ea&s;y with|out affectation;

<L>And if for &s;ummer you would &s;eek,</L>
<L>'Twas painted in her eye, her cheek.</L></Q>
The goodne&s;s of her under&s;tanding has been made &s;ufficiently apparent to the reader by her letter, be|fore in&s;erted, to AEmily on the &s;ubject of her mar|riage. So happy in natural and acquired perfec|tions, no wonder &s;he was the delight of her parents, and the admiration of all who knew her.</P>

<P>MARIA Hartry was propo&s;ed as a ju&s;t pattern for all the young ladies in the country. No young man could &s;ee her without loving; nor was there any father but what courted, and would have been proud of her alliance. Yet, amid&s;t the many admir|ers that &s;he gained, the many compliments which were paid her, and though &s;urrounded by the whole artillery of love; no gallant could yet boa&s;t of hav|ing received more encouragement from her than was becoming an acquaintance, for as &s;uch only did &s;he regard all who had offered her their &s;ervices: not|with&s;tanding which, as I profe&s;s my&s;elf to be a faith|ful hi&s;torian, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, that &s;he could not call her heart her own, it having long &s;ince, in her pri|vate determination, been be&s;towed on a neighbouring gentleman, who&s;e name was Melvill; though he was ignorant of his good fortune in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;o ine&s;timable a trea&s;ure; not that he was blind to the united charms of per&s;on and under&s;tanding, which &s;o apparently &s;hone forth in Maria, but be|cau&s;e his diffidence prevented him from a&s;&s;uring him|&s;elf
<PB N="48" REF="032122_0052_0FF13944E5177FA8">
of that &s;ucce&s;s, which only depended on his a&s;k|ing her the que&s;tion.</P>
<P>I will not pay &s;o bad a compliment to that young gentleman's under&s;tanding as to &s;ay, he was the hand|&s;ome&s;t man nature ever formed; let it &s;uffice to a&s;|&s;ure my readers, that &s;he had been far from deficient in adorning him with per&s;onal qualifications, to which his politene&s;s gave an additional lu&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">re; his father dying whil&s;t he was yet young, left him heir to a very large e&s;tate; on this provi&s;o, that he &s;hould not come into the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion thereof, till he attained the age of twenty-five years: a right which though not allowed of, either by nature or ju&s;tice, many pa|rents thus a&s;&s;ume, by prolonging the minority of their children. As he lived with his guardian, in the neighbourhood of Sir Thomas Hartry, he of cour&s;e was intimate with that gentleman, and from his frequent vi&s;its at Oak-hall, had drank deep of the delicious poi&s;on of love, before he knew by what name of &s;tile his regard; recollection of the plea&s;ure which he had alway found in Maria's company, too &s;oon, alas! convinced him of the true rea&s;on, and he &s;everal times determined to inform her thereof; but &s;uch is the mode&s;ty attendant on unfeigned love, that notwith&s;tanding the various opportunities he had, his fear overcame his regard, and prevented his beginning the only &s;ubject on which he wi&s;h'd to talk; but 'tis not the tongue alone, that can declare
<PB N="49" REF="032122_0053_0FF1394917D472D8">
our pa&s;&s;ion; no, our eyes pronounce it, and every action &s;peaks; what though he never told her that he lov'd, his whole behaviour &s;hew'd it; it was ap|parent to every eye; nor could Maria any longer be blind, to what &s;he &s;o earne&s;tly wi&s;h'd to be true.</P>
<P>She &s;aw it with plea&s;ure; and thus Melvill had a more powerful advocate in her brea&s;t, than he even dared to hope: thus &s;ituated, &s;he daily expected a declaration, and as often was di&s;appointed; for though her behaviour gave him every encourage|ment the nature of their connection would admit of, he could not &s;o far overcome the natural timid re|&s;pect of his &s;oul. Under the&s;e almo&s;t in&s;upportable torments, his health, from inward grief, &s;en&s;ibly de|clined; his life became burthen&s;ome and tedious; he never was ea&s;y one minute when out of her pre|&s;ence, and at the &s;ame time, was racked with the mo&s;t tormenting fears of loo&s;ing her forever: In this un|happy &s;tate did he for &s;ome time live, till no longer able to endure it, he determined to acquaint her with his inviolable attachment, and hope the be&s;t. When we have form'd any favorite &s;cheme, it is an ea&s;y matter of putting it into execution; thus as Melvill had formed a de&s;ign on the &s;ucce&s;s of which, all the happine&s;s of his future life depended, he burnt with the mo&s;t eager impatience to be delivered from &s;o painful an uncertainty; and as very few days pa&s;&s;ed in which he was not at Oak-hall, he &s;oon found the &s;o much wi&s;hed for opportunity.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="032122_0054_0FF1394AD1F7B758">
One very warm day, after having dined there, Ma|ria propo&s;ed a walk in the grove, which her parents immediately a&s;&s;ented to, &s;aying that they would fol|low her; thus luckily leaving our young couple to|gether at which Maria was not a little plea&s;ed. Mel|vill having previou&s;ly informed her, that when a proper time offered, he could wi&s;h to have &s;ome con|ver&s;ation with her; therefore joyfully leaving her parents to follow them, &s;he &s;et out with Melvill, al|mo&s;t dying with curio&s;ity to know what he had to communicate.</P>
<P>She wi&s;hed it might be what &s;he &s;u&s;pected; tho' at the &s;ame time &s;he was not totally devoid of fear, le&s;t it &s;hould, not being provided with a &s;uitable an&s;wer thereto: from the&s;e con&s;iderations therefore, her mind was far from being the mo&s;t tranquil. Con|&s;cious of his intentions, Melvill was not in a very en|viable &s;ituation, and trembled &s;o violently, that had &s;he not been as much agitated, it could never have e&s;caped her notice: however, by both being equally concerned, they neither of them perceived it in the other, and thus walked without uttering a &s;yllable, till they arrived at a bench in the grove, where they &s;at down, both &s;till pre&s;erving the exacte&s;t &s;ilence: many attempts, indeed, to &s;peak, were made on both &s;ides, but nothing more than&mdash;Sir&mdash;and Madam&mdash;I beg your pardon&mdash;I thought you &s;poke&mdash;and &s;uch incoherent &s;entences pa&s;&s;ed, till alter &s;ome he|&s;itation, Maria took courage enough to a&s;k, what

bu&s;ine&s;s Mr. Melvill could have with her? to which he returned no an&s;wer, and put her to the painful nece&s;&s;ity of repeating the que&s;tion; when no longer able to re&s;train his pa&s;&s;ion, he dropt on one knee, and &s;eizing her hand cried, "Can you lovely Maria, even appear to be ignorant of what I have to &s;ay?&mdash;Who can be permitted to conver&s;e with you, with|out involuntary loving you?&mdash;Can you be mi&s;tre&s;s of tho&s;e charms and wonder at my pa&s;&s;ion?&mdash;Yes, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">eare&s;t angel, I love you with the mo&s;t ardent affec|tion; but could I have divin'd, that a declaration thereof would have &s;o far offended you (as by your countenance I &s;ee you now are) my lips for ever &s;hould have been clo&s;ed, and I would have carried the &s;ecret to my early grave. What vanity could induce me to hope your kind notice, with &s;o &s;mall a &s;hare of attraction and merit to recommend me?&mdash;But do not, dear Maria, do not hate me; though you cannot love, do not de&s;pi&s;e me."&mdash;"De&s;pi&s;e you!&mdash;no, Mr. Melvill, heaven forbid I &s;hould de&s;pi&s;e any one!&mdash;But pray, Sir, ri&s;e:&mdash;you di&s;tre&s;s me&mdash;in|deed you do."&mdash;"I did not mean it, replied he, I would &s;ooner die, than give you one moment's un|ea&s;ine&s;s:&mdash;but will you then thus reject me for ever?&mdash;Oh! do not look with &s;uch chilling indifference: allow me to hope, without tre&s;pa&s;&s;ing the bounds of delicacy, one favourable expre&s;&s;ion."&mdash;"What would you have me &s;ay?"&mdash;"Only that I am not quite indifferent to you, not&punc; hateful"!&mdash;"You are,

<P>The arrival of Sir Thomas and Lady Hartry put an end to the conver&s;ation for this time. The di&s;|cour&s;e turned on different topics, and our young cou|ple parted much better plea&s;ed with each other than when they met; Maria, to find that &s;he had no placed her affections on a &s;en&s;ele&s;s and unworthy object; and Melvill, that he had gained a kind of permi&s;&s;ion to write to her, which he determined to do immediately on his return home.</P>

<P>MELVILL was amu&s;ing him&s;elf after the man|ner mentioned at the conclu&s;ion of my la&s;t chapter, when Charlotte entered the room with a letter, which having given him, &s;he &s;miling, retired; but the joy that he had conceived, at the receipt of an epi&s;tle from Maria, was quickly converted into the mo&s;t poignant grief, when, on opening it, he read only the following words:</P>

<P>On reading this extraordinary note, our hero was little better than one mad: his mind was agitated

with the mo&s;t perplexing doubts and fears; and in this agony did he &s;et out for Oak-hall, without giv|ing any an&s;wer to the repeated que&s;tions of Mi&s;s How|ard, who had no &s;mall rea&s;on to be &s;urprized at his behaviour; nor indeed could &s;he form any conjec|ture of the cau&s;e, 'till, ju&s;t as he was &s;itting out, throwing her Maria's note, he cried, "Madam, read that;&mdash;then wonder, if you can, that I am di&s;tract|ed."</P>
<P>On his arrival at Sir Thomas Hartry's, he found that both he and his lady were out, but that Maria had walked into the grove; thither he ha&s;tened with all the impetuo&s;ity of a lover, and found her on the &s;ame bench, where but the preceeding day he had di&s;clo&s;ed his love; he found her, 'tis true;&mdash;but, oh heart piercing &s;ight! with one hand &s;he was &s;up|porting her head, and with the other, &s;he wiped away the tears, which fell in torrents from her lovely eyes. She was &s;o lo&s;t in thought, that he got pretty near before &s;he perceived him; but when the ru&s;tling of the leaves drew her attention that way, &s;tarting up, with eager tran&s;ports, &s;he cry'd, "Oh!

<P>MR. Clunch was the &s;ole heir of Sir Toby Clunch, who having lo&s;t his wife in childbed of this &s;on, grew &s;o immoderately fond of him as never to &s;uffer him out of his &s;ight; &s;o that we may rea&s;on|ably &s;uppo&s;e the education that he gave him was not the mo&s;t refined; indeed his only concern was, to make him ma&s;ter of hunting, &s;hooting, and other &s;uch ru&s;tic qualifications; in which he &s;ucceeded &s;o happily, as to have him reckoned at the age of twen|ty-five, the time of this propo&s;al, the complete&s;t &s;port&s;man in the country; that is, he would fight a main of cocks, drive a &s;et of hor&s;es, ride a fox cha&s;e, drink his bottle, or &s;hoot flying, with any man <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">n the three kingdoms for five hundred guineas, play or pay; and in the&s;e five things con&s;i&s;ted all his excel|lence; &s;weet recommendations! to a girl of Ma|ria's delicate feelings: his father had likewi&s;e not
<PB N="62" REF="032122_0066_0FF139720F331D00">
forgot to in&s;til &s;ome of his favourite principles into him; &s;uch as, "Children have not, or ought not to have, any will of their own;&mdash;that all their actions tend to one great end,&mdash;obedience," and many others equally arbitrary and ridiculous.&mdash;When Sir Toby therefore mentioned this match to him, all the an|&s;wer he made to it was,&mdash;"Why, ay, I'll marry her, if you think it proper; otherwi&s;e, I am very well as I am,&mdash;how&s;omever, I'm glad you've appointed this afternoon for the meeting, becau&s;e I am en|gaged to hunt to-morrow with neighbour Trott|all."&mdash;</P>
<P>Such was the gentleman who arrived at Oak-Hall to pay his addre&s;&s;es to the lovelie&s;t of her &s;ex; and to who&s;e beauty her anxiety and concern gave an additional lu&s;tre: After a little general conver&s;ation, the young couple were left alone, and &s;ome time e|lap&s;ed before one word was &s;poke on either &s;ide, Mr. Clunch being very bu&s;y in tying &s;ome kno<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he la&s;h of his whip; however recollecting him&s;elf, he approach'd nearer to Maria, and made the following elegant &s;peech.</P>
<P>"I &s;uppo&s;e Mi&s;s, you know my bu&s;ine&s;s here;&mdash;my father has ordered me to wait on you; for as he &s;ays, we are to be married, he thinks it proper we &s;hould be a little acquainted beforehand; though for my own part, I don't &s;ee the nece&s;&s;ity for it; but it &s;eems it is the way of your great folks; and &s;ince I am here, I'll tell you a piece of my mind&mdash;look
<PB N="63" REF="032122_0067_0FF13976EEFD9250">
ye, Mi&s;s, I am a man of few words.&mdash;I don't love your high-flown &s;peeches, becau&s;e I don't under|&s;tand them, if you can like me for a hu&s;band&mdash;I'm your man: but what do I &s;ay&mdash;if? for your fa|ther &s;ays you mu&s;t, and that's enough."&mdash;A great deal more of the &s;ame &s;ort did Maria &s;uffer him to run on, before &s;he interrupted him; which &s;he at length did, though in the gentele&s;t terms po&s;&s;ible, left he &s;hould fly into a pa&s;&s;ion, and thereby rou&s;e her father, whom &s;he knew to be not far off;&mdash;with the mo&s;t per&s;ua&s;ive eloquence "&s;he begg'd him not to importane her any longer on the &s;ubject, for that &s;he could never think of him for an hu&s;band, that &s;he &s;hould always be proud to re&s;pect him as an acquaintance; but found her&s;elf unequal to the ta&s;k of loving him with the tenderne&s;s of a wife."</P>
<P>Rough as the &s;urrounding woods, all the an&s;wer this unfeeling brute returned to her remon&s;trances, was, "why, for the matter of that, I can't help it&mdash;I believe there will be but little love lo&s;t between us; nor &s;hould I ever have troubled my head about lov|ing you, but that my father has expre&s;sly &s;aid, I &s;hall marry you; and your's &s;ays the &s;ame."&mdash;"I am &s;ure he could not &s;o far have forgot him&s;elf," replied Maria.&mdash;"Nay, but he did, an&s;wered the &s;quire, and marry me you mu&s;t; unle&s;s you have a mind to be a di&s;obedient girl:&mdash;but as I am obliged to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e out ear|ly to-morrow, I will take my leave of you; &s;o Mi&s;s, I wi&s;h you a good night:&mdash;I &s;hall acquaint Sir Tho|mas
<PB N="64" REF="032122_0068_0FF1397A91AE6DA0">
of your behaviour, I a&s;&s;ure you;&mdash;your &s;ervant.&mdash;So &s;aying, he fallied out in que&s;t of her father, to whom he related all that had pa&s;&s;ed, not without &s;ome favorable additions on his own &s;ide.</P>
<P>When Maria found her&s;elf alone, bur&s;ting into tears, with uplifted hands, &s;he exclaimed,&mdash;"And is it po&s;&s;ible, my father can &s;eriou&s;ly think of marrying me to &s;uch a wretch?&mdash;a brute, devoid of every &s;en&s;e of feeling!&mdash;"<HI>Your father &s;ays you</HI> SHALL <HI>marry me,</HI> tho&s;e were his words:&mdash;Sure no &s;uch unju&s;t re|&s;olve ever could e&s;cape his lips.&mdash;Would he, who hitherto has let my inclinations be as free as air, for the &s;ake of a little pelf, tie me to a wretch whom my &s;oul dete&s;ts, on whom I can never look but with abhorrence?&mdash;SHALL <HI>marry me!</HI>&mdash;Surely, if the &s;in of di&s;obedience admits of palliation, it is where parents cruelly u&s;urp an authority, by endeavouring to force the hearts of their children; and which no &s;ituation in life, however elevated or deba&s;ed, can give them a ju&s;t right to.&mdash;Oh! Melvill, you have my heart, and on you alone will I be&s;tow my hand."</P>
<P>Thus was the lovely Maria bewailing her misfor|tunes, when the door opened, and pre&s;ented her fa|ther, with a much more angry look than &s;he had ever &s;een him wear before:&mdash;"Little did I think Maria, &s;aid he, on entering, that I &s;hould ever have &s;o much occa&s;ion to be di&s;&s;atisfied with you, what is the rea|&s;on that you do not behave even with common civ|ility to the man whom I have fixed upon for your

hu&s;band?"&mdash;"I did indeed Sir, &s;aid &s;he behave re|&s;pectfully to him; Oh Sir!&mdash;on my knees, let me intreat you by all the tender ties of nature, to remem|ber, that equality and &s;ympathy of feelings in marri|age, is the only probable method to en&s;ure felicity; do not make your only child unhappy, by dooming her to receive the churli&s;h addre&s;&s;es of that odious man.&mdash;Man, do I call him? he is not worthy the name; a brute, that,"&mdash;"This to my face, interrupt|ed Sir Thomas, take care, take care what you &s;ay; I have always been a kind, indulgent father to you, can forgive any thing but ob&s;tinate di&s;obedience.&mdash;Make you unhappy!&mdash;why, have not I provided an hu&s;band for you? a rich man!&mdash;don't I do all in my power to make you happy?&mdash;and now fore|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ooth, you &s;ay you don't like him; what, I &s;uppo&s;e you want a frenchified beau, full of flattery and fa&s;h|ion, a thing made by taylors and barbers; go, go, you're a &s;illy girl, and don't know what you like;&mdash;be&s;ides, what right have you to like?&mdash;it is I mu&s;t like.

condition, when lady Hartry entered the room, brought thither by the elevation of her hu&s;band's voice; as &s;oon as Maria &s;aw her mother, immediate|ly ri&s;ing up, &s;he de&s;ired her to intercede for her with Sir, Thomas, whom &s;he &s;aid, &s;he had very unwilling|ly di&s;obliged, by expre&s;&s;ing her reluctance at receiv|ing the vi&s;its of Mr. Clunch, as of one who was to be her hu&s;band and earne&s;tly begg'd her to di&s;&s;uade him from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he odious match on which he had &s;et his heart.&mdash;As nothing out of the common cour&s;e of nature can be of any long continuance, &s;o Sir Thomas's pa&s;&s;ion &s;oon began to &s;ub&s;ide, and give way to the powerful conductre&s;s of all our actions, rea|&s;on; nor was he long able to with&s;tand the well timed arguments of a &s;en&s;ible wife, joined to the more powerful &s;olicitations of an amiable daughter, but ki&s;&s;ing Maria, told her he had been too ha&s;ty, and &s;aw his error, bid her be a good girl, and endeavor to like Mr. Clunch; and concluded with an a&s;&s;urance of doing every thing in his power to make her hap|py.&mdash;Thus this quarrel ended, and in an hour not only &s;eemed but really was forgot, by all the parties, except the heroine of the piece, who&s;e re&s;t that night was not a little di&s;turbed, by the concern &s;he felt for her father's ob&s;tinacy, in thus per&s;i&s;ting in a match, which &s;he never could or would agree to.</P>

<P>AS none of the family at Oak-Hall were acquaint|ed with Melvill's pa&s;&s;ion, he continued his vi&s;its there as u&s;ual, and in a few days had the happine&s;s of being an hour with his Maria, who informed him o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> all the particulars of the &s;cene related in the la&s;t chapter. The re&s;ult of their conference was, that Maria &s;hould di&s;cover the hi&s;tory of their pa&s;&s;ion to her mother, and beg her kind a&s;&s;i&s;tance, in endeav|ouring to per&s;uade Sir Thomas to agree to their mar|riage; accordingly &s;he &s;oon found an opportunity of relating the affair to Lady Hartry, which &s;he did with the mo&s;t candid ingenuity, without concealing a &s;ingle circum&s;tance; at the &s;ame time entreating her, as &s;he valued her happine&s;s and peace of mind, to per&s;uade Sir Thomas not to attempt to force her inclinations, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ay her under the &s;evere ta&s;k of di&s;|obedience to a parent's command. This good wo|man was &s;o well plea&s;ed at her daughter's &s;incerity, that &s;he wanted but little per&s;ua&s;ion to do what &s;he was de&s;ired, and promi&s;ed, that the fir&s;t opportunity &s;he had, &s;he would u&s;e all the rhetoric &s;he was mi&s;t|re&s;s of, to per&s;ude her hu&s;band to relinqui&s;h all thoughts of Mr. Clunch.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="032122_0072_0FF139851DEE46F8">
The next time they were alone, he luckily opened the &s;ubject, by &s;aying," I can't imagine what rea|&s;on that girl can have, for &s;o &s;trongly objecting to marrying the per&s;on whom my prudence has &s;elect|ed, as one fit to be her hu&s;band; a young man of per&s;on, family and fortune, who demands no money till after my death too; a plaguing, provoking little jade; when I have found a &s;uitable match for her, in all re&s;pects, &s;he for&s;ooth, mu&s;t object to it, by &s;ay|ing, <HI>She cannot love him,</HI> but &s;he &s;hall have him I'm determined, or I'll never give her a farthing."&mdash;As lady Hartry had re&s;olv'd not to mention a word of Melvill, le&s;t he &s;hould imagine, as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e &s;ometimes would, that &s;he was joined in a plot again&s;t him;&mdash;&s;he only interrupted him, by gently &s;aying, "Nay&punc; "now my dear, you are indeed too violent; con&s;ider that we can never account for natural antipathies of our own, to particular people, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> le&s;s for the&s;e of others; &s;he is young and may hereafter know better; but let me entreat you, as &s;he is &s;o &s;trongly re&s;olv|ed again&s;t the match, to think no more of it. Don't Sir Thomas, make your girl unhappy."&mdash;But all this &s;ignified nothing; he had formed a re&s;olution, and it was not in the power of words to make him alter it; he was re&s;olutely determined not to give up the point, thorefore ending were he began, "that if &s;he would not marry Clunch, he would di&s;inherit her, he left the room.</P>

<P>OUR lovers, thus happy in the anticipation of fu|ture joys, had been &s;ometime alone; when they were &s;uddenly &s;urpri&s;ed by the unexpected return of Sir Thomas, who immediately bur&s;t into the room where they were &s;itting; happy was it for lady Hartry that &s;he had left them, being thereby rendered un&s;u&s;|pected of having had a hand in this meeting; although the bare finding the young couple together, would have been &s;ufficient grounds for Sir Thomas to have reprimanded Melvill; yet to add to the misfortune he had interrupted them in a minute, &s;acred alone to love and privacy; in &s;hort he had found his daugh|ter cla&s;p'd in the arms of him &s;he fondly lov'd: to de&s;cribe the &s;urprize painted on each of their coun|tenances at this minute, would require the pen of a Fielding, or the pencil of a Hogarth; there was but one part for Maria to take; and therefore with an a&s;&s;umed anger, pu&s;hing Melvill from her, &s;he utter'd &s;ome few inarticulate words in a kind of reproof.&mdash;Sir Thomas now began, by telling him, that after what had pa&s;&s;ed, he was much &s;urpri&s;ed at &s;eeing him

there, and in&s;i&s;ted he would not for the future trou|ble Oak-Hall with his company, for if he did, as a gentleman, he &s;hould be obliged to call him to an account for his behaviour.

<P>THE nece&s;&s;ary preparations for Maria's wedding were immediately begun, and Clunch &s;pent as much of his time as he could &s;pare from his ru&s;tic amu&s;e|ments, at Oak-Hall with his intended bride, who

received his vi&s;its with great &s;eeming complacen&s;e, con&s;cious that they could be of no long continuance. When &s;he was not thus employed, &s;he had the felici|ty of enjoying the company of her two friends, with|out controul; and indeed the affection which the&s;e young ladies had mutually for each other, made their time to pa&s;s with the greate&s;t &s;ocial harmony; every day brought with it &s;ome new plea&s;ure; and as the &s;ure&s;t means of augmenting their fe&s;tivity, each of them &s;eem'd more a&s;&s;iduous to promote the bli&s;s of the other two than her own.

<P>During this young lady's &s;tay at Oak-Hall, poor Melvill's time had pa&s;&s;ed but heavily; however, to compen&s;ate for all his torments, &s;he brought him a letter from Maria, containing fre&s;h a&s;&s;urances of re|gard; which when he received, in an involuntary exta&s;y, he exclaimed;

As it was agreed on that Melvill &s;hould leave Eng|land, as &s;oon as he had gained a promi&s;e from Sir Thomas to con&s;ent to their marriage when he came of age; he had taken care to prepare everything ne|ce&s;&s;ary for his voyage: nor indeed was he di&s;plea&s;ed at thus having a plea to &s;atisfy his eager curio&s;ity, by vi&s;iting foreign countries, though at the price of be|ing &s;eparated from Maria. And when the de&s;tined morn arrived, he ha&s;tened to the church, were the other company were already a&s;&s;embled; con&s;i&s;ting of the intended bride and bridegroom, AEmily Sum|mers, Sir Thomas, and Lady Hartry, and Sir Toby Clunch: Maria trembled with apprehen&s;ion; but that only &s;erved to ca&s;t an unu&s;ual glow upon her countenance, and made her look uncommonly beau|tiful; nor was her concern on &s;uch an occa&s;ion taken notice of, as a mode&s;t diffidence is u&s;ual.</P>

<P>I DON'T doubt but my young female readers, if any &s;uch I am honoured with, will be apt to con|demn and de&s;pi&s;e poor Maria for want of fidelity, or rather of re&s;olution; but let them con&s;ider, and make her ca&s;e their own, and I am &s;ure their contempt will be converted into genero&s;ity. A young lady educated with &s;o &s;trict a &s;en&s;e of honour and truth as &s;he was, could not be guilty of &s;uch premeditated deceit; the &s;olemnity of the place, the awful grandeur of the ceremony, all forbade it; pa&s;|&s;ion had before ob&s;cured her rea&s;on, but it now ju&s;t|ly appeared to her, like going to church with a de|&s;ign to utter a premeditated fal&s;ehood in the &s;ight of God: yet notwith&s;tanding all this, &s;he &s;uffered the mo&s;t painful conflict, before &s;he could &s;o far let her virtue overcome her love; but when &s;he had thus nobly gained an a&s;cendancy over her pa&s;&s;ions, &s;he left that innate &s;atisfaction which con&s;cious virtue

always does, on the performance of any good ac|tion; but that &s;atisfaction was but of a very &s;hort du|ration, and in&s;tantly vani&s;hed, when on turning her head round, &s;he ob&s;erved in Melvill's face the di&s;|traction of his heart and immediately after &s;aw him leave the church; it was then the thoughts of having deceived him, and lo&s;t him for ever, ru&s;h'd upon her mind in their full force; nay, even with aggravated circum&s;tances: this was far too much for her tender nature to &s;upport; &s;he immediately fainted away, before the material part of the ceremony were per|formed, and threw the whole church into confu&s;ion: &s;he was carried home &s;en&s;ele&s;s: but by being put to bed, and by the application of proper remedies &s;oon came to her&s;elf.</P>
<P>Almo&s;t every one then pre&s;ent, put different con|&s;tructions on this accident: No one except lady Hartry and AEmily were acquainted with the true cau&s;e; they had as well as Maria ob&s;erved Melvill, and on his leaving the church in &s;o extraordinary a manner, had too well gue&s;&s;ed what where his inten|tions: to the&s;e, when alone, our afflicted heroine unburthened her full heart; and having made all the excu&s;es &s;he could think of to palliate her infidel|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ty, conjured her mother as a proof of her &s;ympa|thetic feelings, to &s;end to know what was become of Melvill: lady Hartry, with true maternal fondne&s;s, was ready to admit of any plea that her da<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ghter

could make, and joined with AEmily in a&s;&s;uring her, that &s;he thought her more worthy of pity than cen|&s;ure; after which &s;he mentioned her &s;u&s;picions of Melvill's being gone abroad, the better to prepare her for &s;uch a &s;troke, in ca&s;e it &s;hould prove true, and promi&s;ed to &s;atisfy her curio&s;ity, by &s;ending to Mr. Howard's immediately, which &s;he accordingly did; and in return to her me&s;&s;age, had the morti|fication of hearing from Charlotte, that Melvill was by that time at Calais, having previous to his depar|ture, informed Mr. Howard of that part of the af|fair, which was left untold by her, only becau&s;e &s;he was not acquainted with the i&s;&s;ue of their &s;cheme; that his intention was to endeavour, by a variety of objects, to drive from his mind a woman, whom he no longer held worthy of a place in it; and la&s;tly, that he had promi&s;ed to write, when he arrived at Paris.&mdash;It was on this promi&s;e only, that Lady Har|try ventured to inform her daughter of what &s;he had heard, which &s;he at length did, though with the great|e&s;t caution and tenderne&s;s; gently breaking it to her, by almo&s;t imperceptible degrees, till &s;he had made her acquainted with the whole.</P>
<P>Although poor Maria was very well prepared for this blow, and though it was no more than what &s;he might rea&s;onably expect, &s;till &s;he had flattered her|&s;elf with the old proverb, That while there's life, there's hope: &s;he had flattered her&s;elf, that when

Melvill's anger began to &s;ub&s;ide, he would &s;tay and &s;ee the end of &s;o extraordinary an affair; that he would defer his journey, till he was thoroughly con|vinced of her infidelity:&mdash;he thought very ju&s;tly, that nothing could be a &s;tronger proof thereof than thus giving her&s;elf to another before his face; his pa&s;&s;ion ob&s;cured tho&s;e rea&s;ons which aro&s;e &s;o power|fully in her mind to countenance the act; tho&s;e rea|&s;ons la&s;ted but &s;o long, as while &s;he remained in that uncertainty of doubt and fear, but when the an&s;wer to her mother's note arrived, &s;he in&s;i&s;ted on &s;eeing it, which lady Hartry at fir&s;t refus'd, as thinking one part thereof, not &s;o proper for her peru&s;al; but as it is impo&s;&s;ible long to maintain a denial of any thing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> we love, Maria &s;oon got the better, and by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> victory was made completely mi&s;erable: for tho' her mother had before informed her of every part thereof, &s;till &s;he had done it in a manner which gave her &s;ome &s;mall gleam of hopes, and which, by the &s;ight of it, &s;he was convinced &s;he had no rea&s;on to indulge; for a long time after reading it, her mind was torn by the contrary pa&s;&s;ions of contempt, love and pity; &s;ometimes &s;he would rail at him for not waiting to &s;ee the event of an affair, which it &s;o near|ly concerned him to be acquainted with; at others, &s;he would expre&s;s her commendations of him for thus behaving to a per&s;on who had u&s;ed him &s;o &s;can|dalou&s;ly, and then would vent the mo&s;t bitter inve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">|ives

again&s;t her&s;elf; but as according to the natural order of things, the human con&s;titution cannot long thus exi&s;t upon the &s;tretch, in a &s;hort time the agony of her mind affected the body, and threw her into a violent fever, in which &s;he quickly became delirious, and was continually calling on Melvill; &s;ometimes &s;he would talk to him as if he were pre&s;ent, at others, &s;he would fall into the mo&s;t violent fits of pa&s;&s;ionate rage, and in this manner rave, till nature being al|mo&s;t exhau&s;ted, a flood of tears came &s;ea&s;onably to her relief.</P>

<P>With all the affection of friend&s;hip, and at the &s;ame time, with the the unlimited extent of a paren|tal love, he u&s;ed every argument he could think of, to paliate her grief; and as a proof of the &s;incerity of his wi&s;hes for her happine&s;s, in&s;tantly wrote a letter to Melvill, which he directed to the po&s;t hou&s;e at Calais, acquainting him with the alteration of his &s;entiments, and kindly re-inviting him to Oak-Hall.</P>

remembrance of her former kindne&s;s; the tranquility of her mind was &s;oon in &s;ome degree re&s;tored, which added to her youth and natural &s;trength, began to re|e&s;tabli&s;h her health; the ro&s;es that &s;o long had left her cheeks, began now to recover their accu&s;tomed bloom; and as after a tedious gloomy winter, all na|ture gladdens at the approach of &s;pring, &s;o there was no one in the hou&s;e, or neighbourhood, who did not really rejoice at Maria's recovery, which was in a &s;hort time totally completed:&mdash;and thus the family at Oak-Hall, of which, AEmily &s;till made one, all but Maria, regained their former &s;erenity and peace.</P>
<P>When Mr. Clunch found that Sir Thomas was no longer an advocate for him with Maria, he was ea&s;i|ly induced to retract his claim, and in a few weeks after, married the daughter of one of his father's ten|ant's, with whom he probably found more real hap|pine&s;s, than ever he could have done with a per&s;on, who&s;e &s;entiments and pur&s;uits were &s;o widely diffe|rent from his own.</P>
<P>As Sir Henry Summers had now been ab&s;ent much longer than he at fir&s;t intended, AEmily began to be not a little &s;urpri&s;ed thereat, as well as puzzled to find out what bu&s;ine&s;s he could have there to de|tain him &s;o long; nor could &s;he avoid ob&s;erving, that he had never made mention of it in any one of his letters; however, as he wrote con&s;tantly to inform her of his welfare, and as Mr. Martin had in the la&s;t
<PB N="91" REF="032122_0095_0FF139D345067BD8">
letter given her a hint of an intended vi&s;it, &s;he was ea&s;ily prevailed upon by Maria to remain at Oak|Hall; where, by their mutual de&s;ire, Charlotte How|ard now was.</P>
<P>Nothing therefore was wanting to complete the felicity of this family, but Melvill's return, which Maria had waited for, &s;ome-time, with the greate&s;t re&s;ignation and patience; but when the period was e|lap&s;ed, whereat &s;he had flattered her&s;elf with the plea&s;ing expectation of beholding him, and in which &s;he was mo&s;t grievou&s;ly di&s;appointed, her former un|ea&s;ine&s;s began to return, and from the natural incli|nation which &s;he had for &s;olitude, &s;oon &s;ettled into a melancholy de&s;pondence, when as if adver&s;e fate had not &s;ufficiently tormented her, Mr. Howard re|ceived a letter from Melvill, wherein he informed him&mdash;"That he had ju&s;t recovered from a violent fit of illne&s;s, and was preparing to leave Paris, where he then was, in order to vi&s;it Madrid; that it &s;till remained his firm re&s;olve to endeavor, by a quick &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of new objects, to recall his heart from Oak-Hall; that as he &s;hould be continually upon the move, it would be impo&s;&s;ible for him to hear from England; his de&s;ign in which was&punc; to avoid &s;eeing the very name of Hartry, that nothing might retard the cure he hoped in a &s;hort time to work in his mi&s;|placed affections."</P>

received the letter Sir Thomas &s;ent after him to Ca|lais: and although the news pierced poor Maria to the heart, yet &s;till, to oblige her parents, &s;he endeav|oured to a&s;&s;ume the placid &s;miles of cool indiffer|ence: Oh, what a painful ta&s;k to wear a cheerful countenance with a gloomy heart!&mdash;Out of duty and complai&s;ance to them &s;he entered into company, though at the &s;ame time &s;he longed to be alone, to indulge her melancholy reflections on this unfortu|nate affair, which was the more &s;o to her, as &s;he could blame no one for it but her&s;elf: her two bo|&s;om friends, AEmily and Charlotte, endeavoured all in their power to comfort her, the latter of who&s;e company &s;he was remarkably fond of, as &s;he knew by fatal experience the torments of divided love, and would &s;ometimes humour her affliction, by talk|ing of Melvill, in return for which, Maria would &s;ympathize with her in her grief, for the long, long lo&s;t Charles Hartry; in this manner, by each hav|ing a friend to &s;hare in their afflictions, the burthen lay the lighter upon either:&mdash;But as the&s;e reflec|tions will not deliver poor Maria from her mi&s;era|ble &s;ituation; and as I at pre&s;ent &s;ee no probable means of doing it, I mu&s;t be contented to leave her as &s;he is, and take &s;ome further notice of AEmily's af|fairs.</P>
<P>It was now in the delightful month of May, about &s;ix in the evening, while our female friends were

<P>"It may not now my dear AEmily be improper to acquaint you with the cau&s;e of my &s;o &s;udden expe|dition, at which I don't doubt you were very much &s;urprized; but I am &s;ure you will be much more

<P>OUR burle&s;que theatric hero, having fini&s;hed his narrative; Melvill engaged him as a kind of guide, during his &s;tay at Paris, which was about three weeks, but prudently con&s;idering him as one of tho&s;e who knew too much of low life to be tru&s;ted, di&s;mi&s;&s;|ed him on &s;etting out for the capital of Spain; on his arrival at Madrid, our di&s;conted traveller hired lodgings in ane of the mo&s;t capital &s;treets, and by frequenting all public places &s;oon contracted a larger &s;phere of acquaintance than Spani&s;h re&s;erve, e&s;pecial|ly to foreigners, &s;eemed to admit; however, he a|voided any particular intimacy except with Don Carios, who was the only &s;on of a grandee and of one

of the mo&s;t re&s;pectable families in that kingdom.&mdash;This young gentleman was about two and twenty years of age, hand&s;ome in per&s;on, elegant in appear|ance, mode&s;t in behaviour and undaunted in danger, con&s;tant in friend&s;hip, &s;en&s;ible charitable and gene|rous: No wonder that with the&s;e qualifications Mel|vill and he contracted a &s;ympathetic and mutual e&s;|teem for each other, which in a &s;hort time grew into the mo&s;t di&s;intere&s;ted friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>Don Pelajo, the name of Don Carlos's father, had formerly been in the wars, where he had di&s;tingui&s;h|ed him&s;elf much for his bravery; he was judicious, brave <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> prudent: polite and affable to tho&s;e who were acquainted with him, but to &s;trangers appeared to have the national haughtine&s;s &s;tamped upon his deportment; yet even then he rather created re&s;pect than di&s;gu&s;t, he ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ried when very young, but inhe|riting rather too much of the Spani&s;h jealou&s;y, his wife led not the happie&s;t life, and left him at the age of twenty nine, a widower with two children, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> a &s;on and a daughter, what the former was, the reader has already heard, I will now, as near as I am able, draw the picture of his daughter Juliana; who when Melvill fir&s;t &s;aw her, was about eighteen years of age. Her &s;ize of a delicate medium, her complexion &s;o beautiful that had it not been the &s;ame from her youth, malicious &s;candal, would have &s;aid it was ar|tificial, her per&s;on was genteel, her hair and eye|brows

of a beautiful brown, the former curling in ringlets, over her ivory neck, &s;eemed like a gorge|ous net, to entrap the heart of all beholders, the latter formed two exact bows over her large blue eyes, which very few dared to look on twice, and her teeth, to borrow an expre&s;&s;ion from a favourite au|thor, were like poli&s;hed ivory &s;et in a coral bed.&mdash;The&s;e per&s;onal accompli&s;hments, joined to a good natural under&s;tanding, much improved by art, made the lovely Juliana, the mo&s;t accompli&s;hed young lady in Madrid.</P>
<P>Such were the father and daughter to whom Don Carlos introduced Melvill as one of his mo&s;t parti|cular friends, &s;uch was the family by which our he|ro was much care&s;&s;ed, and in who&s;e acquaintance he thought him&s;elf extremely happy.</P>
<P>Don Pelajo gave him a general invitation to his hou&s;e, which to rid him&s;elf of tho&s;e di&s;agreeable thoughts concerning Maria, that he knew would in|trude upon &s;olitude, he co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">dially accepted and made almo&s;t con&s;tant u&s;e of: Don Carlos and he were &s;carce ever a&s;under, as in&s;tead of calling each other, every time they met, gave an additional &s;atisfaction to both, always finding that reciprocal &s;atisfaction when together, which &s;en&s;ible men mu&s;t meet with in conver&s;ing with per&s;ons of equal knowledge</P>
<P>Though in their intercour&s;es Melvill thought him|&s;elf
<PB N="6" REF="032122_0135_0FF13A5BCB8C3510">
happy, &s;till there was a certain <HI>Je ne &s;cais quoi</HI> in his countenance, that plainly &s;hewed he was not &s;o; Don Carlos could not avoid ob&s;erving this un|ea&s;ine&s;s; the real cau&s;e of which the reader knows; and with all the tenderne&s;s of affection, in&s;i&s;ted on being acquainted therewith: Melvill could refu&s;e no|thing to &s;o dear a friend, and therefore informing him of the affair concluded with a determined re&s;olution to forget her, in which he was not a little &s;trengthened by the &s;alutary advice of his &s;econd &s;elf, for &s;o he frequently called Don Carlos.</P>
<P>Juliana, though young, had received &s;everal off|ers from men of leading family and fortune, but con|&s;cious that her own e&s;tate mu&s;t one day be very con|&s;iderable, &s;he thought her&s;elf thereby endowed with an undoubted right, to plea&s;e her&s;elf in &s;o momentu|ous a choice; at lea&s;t &s;uch were the arguments her own mind furni&s;hed her with, to paliate what many deemed imprudence, though the real truth was no other, than that her time was not yet come, &s;he had yet never &s;een any one for whom &s;he felt a tender partiality, but alas! of how &s;hort a duration was her enjoyment of this plea&s;ing indifference; for on her fir&s;t introduction to Melvill, &s;he was &s;eized with a &s;en&s;ation her heart had hitherto been an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;tranger to, her &s;pirits were &s;o fluttered and her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> was &s;o di&s;ordered, that it was with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> made any return to the many compliments which he paid her, and although when he took his

<P>Admiring and admired, our hero would have been completely happy, had not that felicity, as I before &s;aid, been de&s;troyed by the thoughts of the &s;eeming|ly perfidious Maria, who, in &s;pite of him&s;elf, was always the &s;ubject of his private meditations, and al|though to all outward appearance, he &s;eemed per|fectly ea&s;y and compo&s;ed, &s;till he pined inwardly, and would frequently exclaim, "Wretch that I am, why was I ever fool enough to declare my pa&s;&s;ion for a worthle&s;s woman, who mu&s;t now laugh and de|&s;pi&s;e me for my folly?

<P>THE next time our two friends were alone, Don Carlos re&s;umed his di&s;cour&s;e from the former chapter.</P>
<P>Con&s;cious, &s;aid he, that your affections, were al|ready pre-engaged, though on an unde&s;erving object, I endeavoured to per&s;uade my &s;i&s;ter to think no more of you, and to encourage her thereto, have, for which I hope you will pardon me, broken the &s;acred bond of friend&s;hip; by informing her of your unhappy at|tatchment to Maria, though but in part, as I did not mention any thing of her being already married, on|ly a&s;&s;uring her, that your whole heart was fixed on a young lady in England.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="032122_0142_0FF13A75A881B870">
Like you my Henry, &s;he was too much in love to hear rea&s;on, and it was in vain, that I urged a fa|vourite &s;entiment of her own to induce her to forget you&mdash;they never knew to love who knew to change.&mdash;I in vain a&s;ked her what &s;he &s;hould think of you, were you thus di&s;honourable to transfer your affec|tions from one to the other, it all &s;ignified nothing.&mdash;But as you mu&s;t, from fatal experience, know the difficulty of overcoming a mi&s;placed affection, better than I can pretend to inform you; I will &s;ay no more upon the &s;ubject.&mdash;In &s;hort, &s;he in&s;i&s;ted on my declaring it to you, which as &s;he had been candid enough to confe&s;s it, I could not refu&s;e; nor could I break my word with her, without adding thereto, the more flagrant crime of fal&s;ehood. I have al&s;o, as I though it my duty, informed my father of this affair, who would mo&s;t joyfully accept of you for a &s;on in law; I need not &s;urely add, what I hope you are already convinced of, that I &s;hould be highly plea&s;ed to join the more endearing name of brother, to that of friend&mdash;but I fear it will never be&mdash;all that I can now add, is, that I am &s;orry poor Juliana' happine&s;s depends upon your an&s;wer, as I think, I too plainly read it in your <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">.</P>
<P>While Don Carlos was thus &s;peaking, Melvill &s;tood in the greate&s;t perplexity, undetermined what <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> reply, but finding his friend was waiting for an an|&s;wer, as the only re&s;ource, he begged &s;ome time to

con&s;ider of &s;o friendly a propo&s;al and promi&s;ed to in|form him of his re&s;olution, in writing the en&s;uing day, after which, they hurried to their u&s;ual gay com|panions, who&s;e vivacity however was not able to efface the gloom, which the above conver&s;ation had &s;pread upon Melvill's countenance; and when he retired to his bed, it was without the lea&s;t inclina|tion to &s;leep.</P>
<P>He lay ruminating the greate&s;t part of the night on the bu&s;ine&s;s of the &s;ub&s;equent day, &s;o delightful a pro&s;pect was not ea&s;ily renounced.&mdash;A beautiful vir|tuous young lady with an immen&s;e fortune, were &s;trong temptations for a man in his circum&s;tances, &s;o very ill u&s;ed too by that woman where he had garnered up his heart.&mdash;All the&s;e, were great incite|ments to him to re&s;olve to abandon Maria for ever and marry Juliana; but then the thoughts of enter|ing into &s;uch an engagement, when he was convinc|ed how firmly his affections were otherwi&s;e fixed; wounded his con&s;cience as a man of honour and in|tegrity, far too &s;en&s;ibly to &s;uffer him to commit &s;o ba&s;e an action.</P>
<P>After a long and violent conflict; he determined to make this &s;acrifice to Maria; in which he was not a little &s;trengthened, by the fir&s;t gleam of hope that he had entertained &s;ince his departure, and which &s;hot acro&s;s his mind pre&s;enting her to his view in her original &s;implicity and virtue.</P>

<P>A drowning man will catch at every &s;traw. How|ever be that as it may, it fixed him firmly in her fa|vour, and he had the &s;atisfactory con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of having acted right, and in con&s;equence thereof wrote the next morning as follows.</P>

e&s;tate, thought him&s;elf thereby qualified to do whate|ver he ple&s;ed; which plea&s;ure his lord&s;hip once car|ried &s;o far, as very narrowly to e&s;cape being run thro' the body, for plea&s;ing to be in&s;olently rude to a la|dy, who&s;e cau&s;e a gentleman in company cho&s;e to e&s;pou&s;e, and called his lord&s;hip to a pretty &s;evere ac|count for his behaviour; nor was this the only &s;crape he got into, by the invariable di&s;po&s;ition of doing whatever he had a mind to, becau&s;e he had money: but he looked upon them all as actions worthy a buck, in which ideal character it was the height of his ambition to &s;hine.</P>
<P>Being of cour&s;e a pattern of pertne&s;s and affectation, this entirely ob&s;cured his natural parts, which were, in them&s;elves, far from contemptible; and, in proper hands, might have been made u&s;e of to the e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of a commendable character: he likewi&s;e tho't him&s;elf very witty, always endeavouring to appear &s;o, by abu&s;ing every body he &s;aw, whether he knew them or not, in what he called a plea&s;ant vein of hu|mour; which only &s;erved to render him in the eyes of all &s;en&s;ib<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e people more thoroughly ridiculous: for it was as Churchil &s;ays,

<P>He was no &s;ooner &s;eated, than he began to a&s;k &s;ev|eral familiar que&s;tio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s;&mdash;as, how long &s;he had been at Bath?&mdash;how &s;he lik'd it?&mdash;how long &s;he propo|&s;ed &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">aying?&mdash;with many others equally trifling and it &s;ignificant: to all which Maria an&s;wered with the greate&s;t complacence and good nature.</P>
<P>The conver&s;ation had for &s;ome time &s;topped when &s;he unhappily at once gave him an opportunity of re&s;uming <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, and di&s;played his &s;atirical <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, by inadvertently a&s;king, if he knew who the gentleman was, that was then dancing a minuet?</P>

he was therefore rarely &s;een in it, but com|mencing at once the petit maitre and fine gentleman, (characters, which too many young men are ambi|tious of attaining) took lodgings near Covent Gar|den, and wa&s;ted his time in what is commonly call'd a continual round of plea&s;ure, or in other words, of noi&s;y debauchery, and profligate exce&s;s.</P>
<P>As it was very well known, that on the death of his father, he mu&s;t come into four thou&s;and pounds, which had been &s;ettled on him by his grandmother, he found people enough ready to advance him mo|ney, at an exorbitant intere&s;t.</P>

He continued in this cour&s;e of life for nea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> four years, during which time, he contracted a nume|rous acquaintance among people of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ame &s;tamp with him&s;elf, on all of whom he pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s'd him&s;elf for a man of fortune; and, under this character, gain'd &s;omething from mo&s;t of them, that is to &s;ay, he learnt convenience from pick-pockets and &s;harpers, cring|ing from pimps, audacity from bullies, and the noble <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of contrivance from pro&s;titutes: under which five heads, we &s;hall conclude the whole circle of his acquaintance: he was now in continual axpectation of his father's death, which at length happened; not a little ha&s;tened by his favourite &s;ons behaviour, to whom he had frequently repre&s;ented the unavoidable con&s;equences of &s;uch proceedings, but in vain:&mdash;plea&s;ure was the object of his pur&s;uit, nor did he care at how dear a rate he purcha&s;ed it, though were by the death of an indulgent parent.</P>
<P>This happy time once arrived, he came immedi|ately into the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his long expected fortune, and notwith&s;tanding he had been pre acquainted with the exact &s;um, was amazed to find him&s;elf much poorer than he was aware of; for, after hav|ing paid the money he had borrowed, with the inte|re&s;t thereof, his taylor, ho&s;ier, &amp;c. out of the four thou&s;and he had received, he found him&s;elf in actu|al po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of but five hundred; a good &s;tock <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">loaths, and &s;ome little dear bought experience.</P>

<P>THE gentleman, who&s;e hi&s;tory I related in my la&s;t chapter, entered the room, ju&s;t as my lord had determined to give over all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> pur&s;uit of Ma|ria; crying with his u&s;ual impudent vivacity;&mdash;"Well, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> lord, may I give you joy?&mdash;have you found out who this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">air incognita is?&mdash;this terre&s;tial angel?"</P>
<P>"Yes, replied his ma&s;ter, with a &s;ullen di&s;content|edne&s;s,&mdash;I have,&mdash;her name is Hartry,&mdash;&s;he has
<PB N="37" REF="032122_0166_0FF13ACACCF82CD8">
twenty thou&s;and pounds at her own di&s;po&s;al, and as it will therefore be impo&s;&s;ible to put my &s;chemes into execution, I have re&s;olved to think no more of her."&mdash;</P>
<P>Impo&s;&s;ible? there's nothing impo&s;&s;ible to your lord&s;hip's parts, titles and fortune, rejoin'd Mellifont, I thought you had been a man of more intrepidity, than to give up a girl, becau&s;e &s;he has money; that will indeed prevent your making the intended pro|po&s;als, but it can be no impediment to the accom|pli&s;hment of your wi&s;hes."&mdash;</P>
<P>"How, how, demanded my lord, eagerly."</P>
<P>Why, replied he, it will be an ea&s;y matter to watch her &s;ome night from the rooms,&mdash;put her in|to a wrong chair,&mdash;have a carriage waiting.&mdash;force her into it,&mdash;whirl her down to your hou&s;e in Wales, where it will be impo&s;&s;ible for her friends to find her; and then you know force and fear may induce her to what her inclination perhaps would re&s;i&s;t."</P>
<P>"Bravo replied my lord, E'gad that will do; 'twill make a noi&s;e in the world, and give a double reli&s;h to delight; thou &s;halt be my oracle and direct all; I mu&s;t now dre&s;s, and hope before morning, to nick Sir John Softhead out of a thou&s;and: call on me to|morrow forenoon, and we'll &s;ettle the glorious plan of amorous operations."</P>
<P>Thus were the&s;e two villains planning &s;chemes
<PB N="38" REF="032122_0167_0FF13ACF0F6E0708">
for the ruin of an innocent girl, while &s;he was un|knowingly giving them an opportunity of putting them in execution, by going to the rooms a few even|ings after the above conference.</P>
<P>On her entrance the fir&s;t object that &s;truck her eyes was Mellifont: who having already prepared every thing nece&s;&s;ary, ha&s;ten'd to inform my lord of this lucky circum&s;tance; who thought proper not to make his appearance, till it was time to execute their project.</P>
<P>Unhappily for poor Maria, the night &s;eemed to favour their de&s;ign, being very rainy, accompanied with a great deal of thunder and lightning.</P>
<P>On her wanting to go home, to her great &s;urprize, her &s;ervant was not to be found: and &s;he, of cour&s;e, prevented from getting to her chair: while &s;he was &s;tanding in this &s;ituation, my lord, who had taken care to have her &s;ervant made drunk at a neighbour|ing ale-hou&s;e, appeared, and finding what was the cau&s;e of her dilemma, made her an offer of his &s;edan, which was ju&s;t by, and which after &s;ome little apolo|gy, &s;he was too ea&s;ily prevailed on to accept.</P>
<P>While they were &s;tanding together, in the cour&s;e of conver&s;ation, he had a&s;k'd her, whether &s;he was afraid of the lightning? of which having expre&s;&s;ed great apprehen&s;ions, when <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e put her into the chair, he made that a plea for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> her to draw the cur|tains
<PB N="39" REF="032122_0168_0FF13AD0D6EF8560">
clo&s;e; which &s;he accordingly did. My lord, elate with joy at his &s;ucce&s;s, now walked as fa&s;t as he could before the chairmen, to &s;hew them the way; and whom the reward of a couple of guineas, made proceed at an unu&s;ual rate.</P>
<P>They had already got upon the turnpike road, when our heroine, thinking they were very long in carrying her home, opened the curtains, to &s;ee where &s;he was;&mdash;but, good heavens! what was her a&s;ton|i&s;hment, when &s;he &s;ound her&s;elf in an open coun|try, near a mile from Bath, and lord Dapperwit, whom by the moon being ju&s;t ri&s;en, &s;he could ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;h walking before, at a &s;mall di&s;tance.</P>
<P>When &s;he had &s;o far recovered, from the fir&s;t vi|olent effects of her amazement, as to be able to &s;peak, &s;he begg'd the chairmen to &s;top, and i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">form her, whither they were carrying her; to which &s;he re|ceived no other an&s;wer, than being de&s;ired to &s;it &s;till:&mdash;but, added one of them, "I believe your journey with us is almo&s;t at an end: as I think I &s;ee the carriage before us."&mdash;</P>
<P>She then too plainly &s;aw into my lord's villainy; and with tears in her eyes, entreated the chairmen to return:&mdash;in vain did &s;he endeavour to per&s;uade them;&mdash;in vain did &s;he promi&s;e any reward;&mdash;it was all to no purpo&s;e:&mdash;had it been their inclination, it was impo&s;&s;ible; her &s;educer was ju&s;t before and had his eyes con&s;tantly fixed upon the chair.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="032122_0169_0FF13AD606986A60">
As her only re&s;ource therefore, &s;he was obliged to call in patience to her a&s;&s;i&s;tance and hope the be&s;t.</P>
<P>The chair having now &s;topped, my lord handed her into a po&s;t coach; at the &s;ame time telling her, that it would be to no purpo&s;e to make any re&s;i&s;t|ance; which &s;he was too well convinced of before: and con&s;idering that, as it was impo&s;&s;ible for her to e&s;cape, &s;he &s;hould fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e the better, if &s;he gave them no occa&s;ion to u&s;e her roughly, quietly &s;eated her|&s;elf in the carriage next to her betrayer:&mdash;Mellifont who had been waiting for them, having previou&s;ly plac'd him&s;elf on the other &s;ide, and in this &s;ituation, they drove away at an immen&s;e pace, a profound &s;ilence for &s;ome time being ob&s;erved by all the par|ties.</P>

<P>DURING the fir&s;t ten miles of their journey, poor Maria was di&s;&s;olved in tears, and her &s;well'd heart beat, as if it would have bur&s;t its tender pri&s;on, in which &s;tate of melancholy in&s;en&s;ibility, like an ox going to the &s;laughter, or a lamb dumb before its &s;hearers, did &s;he remain for &s;ome time; till, recol|lecting that her tears would do but little towards her enlargement, &s;he at la&s;t took courage to &s;peak to her &s;educer.&mdash;</P>
<P>In the mo&s;t pathetic manner, &s;he intreated him

<P>This was a terrible declaration for the afflicted Ma|ria; who fixing her lovely eyes &s;tedfa&s;tly on the ground, &s;eem'd for &s;ome time &s;tupified by thought; at length ri&s;ing triumphantly, &s;he exclaimed "Yes&mdash;it &s;hall be &s;o&mdash;I am determined&mdash;firmly fixed&mdash;that if before the end of two days, no apparent means for my e&s;cape are found&mdash;I will at once put an end to all my heart-rending mi&s;eries&mdash;by&mdash;by what? oh di&s;tracting thought! by &s;uicide."&mdash;Then a|gain dropping on her knees, and cla&s;ping her hands, &s;he cried, "I know the heinou&s;ne&s;s of the crime, I

<P>WHEN our heroine had made the dreadful re&s;olution, with which I concluded my la&s;t chapter &s;he &s;eemed much more calm and ea&s;y than before: and in order to amu&s;e her&s;elf, took up her favourite author, Shake&s;pear, which lay on a table by her; when on opening it, the fir&s;t words on which &s;he ca&s;t her eyes were,

<P>WHEN Maria had got &s;o far from the hou&s;e of her betrayer, as no longer to be under any apprehen|&s;ions of a pur&s;uit, &s;he again took an opportunity of thanking her deliverer, in the mo&s;t grateful terms: tho he was by no means de&s;erving thereof, as it was not honor, but avarice, which actuated him in this affair; and, to &s;ay the truth, he was in it playing the double villain, having ju&s;t before, received a large &s;um from lord Dapperwit, for his a&s;&s;i&s;tance in bring|ing

<P>When within about fifty miles of Bath, Maria had the happine&s;s of meeting Mr. Howard, who was then going in &s;earch of her.

<P>IT is &s;urely unnece&s;&s;ary for me to inform my dear Melvill, of the rea&s;ons for my departure from Oakhall; he mu&s;t, during my &s;tay there, too often have &s;een the unhappy cau&s;e.</P>
<P>In my younger days, he mu&s;t have ob&s;erved, that unju&s;t taunts, and menaces, were the only returns I received for duty and humility; but being once arrived at a di&s;cretionary age, when dive&s;ted of every juvenile prejudice, I could &s;ee things in their true light; and, finding it was not in my power to plea&s;e my father, by the mo&s;t careful a&s;&s;iduity, I thought his behaviour ju&s;tified me, in re&s;olving at once to rid him of an object, which was &s;o di&s;agreeable, thrice happy, that I am no longer &s;o, and my&s;elf of a life that I was mo&s;t heartily tired of, by endeavour|ing to find that tranquility among &s;trangers, which the unaccountable caprice of a parent deprived me of at home. As it was, in all probability, the la&s;t time I &s;hould ever trouble him, I made no &s;cruple

of taking away fifty pounds, which he had given me to pay to &s;ome trade&s;men; and packing up a few cloaths in my portmanteau, I &s;et out early one mor|ning, on my own hor&s;e, as you mu&s;t have heard, without communicating to any one what were my intentions; nor did I &s;top to take one farewell of my mo&s;t amiable Charlottee; though I now declare to you, that could I have had the lea&s;t idea of what I afterwards &s;uffered, only from the con&s;ideration of the excruciating tortures, which my behaviour mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily give her, &s;he never &s;hould have had &s;o melancholy a cau&s;e for her affliction.</P>
<P>As London was a place which I had a mo&s;t earne&s;t de&s;ire to &s;ee, I determined to go thither immediate|ly, and by getting employment as a clerk, in &s;ome merchant's counting-hou&s;e, for which, by my edu|cation, I was very well qualified, at once make my|&s;elf independent of him, whom, by all the laws of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ture, and paternal tenderne&s;s, I had a right to ex|pect a&s;&s;i&s;tance from.</P>
<P>Accordingly arriving at the place of my de&s;tina|tion, without any adventure worth troubling you with, I the next day, di&s;po&s;ed of my hor&s;e for twen|ty-five pounds; and thus finding my&s;elf ma&s;ter of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ear four&s;core guineas, determined to remain &s;ome|time out of employment, that I might have an oppor|tunity of &s;atisfying my curio&s;ity, by &s;eeing every thing

<P>It was between twelve and one o'clock in the morning; when, pa&s;&s;ing by a genteel hou&s;e, I heard the mo&s;t violent &s;creams, which gave me rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect that &s;ome injury was committing, on a per|&s;on, who, by the voice I knew to be a woman; and pre&s;ently after I &s;aw the door opened, and &s;omething white thrown with the greate&s;t violence into the middle of the &s;treet: but, gracious heaven! <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> was my a&s;toni&s;hment, when on my nearer approach I found it to be a woman almo&s;t naked.

<P>During our little journey, her tears &s;eemed totally to impede all her powers of &s;peech; nor were they at all abated, by the difficulty, which on our arrival, I found in getting her admitted: my landlady objected &s;trongly again&s;t it, for the honor of her hou&s;e; and indeed, every circum&s;tance con&s;idered, there was nothing very unrea&s;onable in her objections; un|doubtedly taking an unknown female, at that time, to a &s;ingle man's lodgings, carried far from a good <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> with it: however, as I &s;tood pretty high in her good graces, by dint of per&s;ua&s;ion I at la&s;t gained my point; and having re&s;igned my bed to the &s;tranger for that night, went to lie wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> another lodger in the hou&s;e: but my mind was too full of this adventure, to &s;uffer me to get any re&s;t.

<P>She was a tall, genteel, well made woman, and notwith&s;tanding her eyes, and the other parts of her face, bore apparent marks of the brui&s;es &s;he had received&mdash;I could &s;till di&s;tingui&s;h that &s;he was hand&s;ome; her teeth were remarkably fine, and as her dre&s;s now in &s;ome mea&s;ure, corre&s;ponded with the dignity of her figure; &s;he had an undoubt|ed right to the title of a fine woman.</P>

<P>I had now no rea&s;on to complain of my lot, as my &s;i&s;ter behaved to me with the greate&s;t tenderne&s;s and affection.</P>

For three weeks I thought my&s;elf, and really was completely happy. She went but very little abroad, tho' there was no day pa&s;&s;ed, in which &s;he was not vi&s;ited by a number of gentlemen, mo&s;t of whom took particular notice of me: but as I thought it no more than they would have done of any other per&s;on, not totally de&s;titute of beauty, I looked upon all the compliments which were made me, as things of cour&s;e, and therefore paid no further attention to them.</P>
<P>There was one gentleman in particular, who&s;e name was Hartrop, who always behav'd to me with an uncommon degree of politene&s;s and warm civili|ty; and he was really an agreeable man, I will con|fe&s;s that I was very much pleas'd with his conver&s;a|tion.</P>
<P>I was frequently alone with him, when he never behav'd in any manner, that was not con&s;i&s;tent with the &s;tricte&s;t re&s;erve and delicacy; nor had I the lea&s;t &s;u&s;picion of the villainy of his intentions, till one particular day, when having dined with us, my &s;i&s;ter left us alone, &s;aying, that &s;he had &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s which would not long detain her, and beg'd me to entertain Mr. Hartrop till her return.</P>
<P>We had not been together many minutes, before he began to take &s;ome unju&s;tifiable liberties with me&punc; whereat I was&punc; as you may imagine, exceedingly a&s;ton|i&s;hed,

and de&s;ired to know what he had &s;een in my behaviour, to authorize &s;uch proceedings? but he only laugh'd, at what he call'd my airs and begin|ning to be intolerably rude, caught me in his arms, and having in&s;ulted me with language, too gro&s;s for me to repeat, avowed the ba&s;ene&s;s of his intentions.</P>
<P>On my crying out he begg'd me to be &s;ilent: to induce me to which, he added, that my noi&s;e would be but little regarded in a hou&s;e of that kind.</P>
<P>Di&s;engaging my&s;elf, I de&s;ir'd to know what he meant by ca&s;ting reflections on my &s;i&s;ter's habita|tion?&mdash;but he would not enter into any altercation, and catching me again in his arms, notwith&s;tanding my utmo&s;t &s;truggles, would &s;oon have overcome me, had it not have been for a great cry of fire, which made him leave me, in order to take care of him&s;elf; but luckily, the alarm was occa&s;ioned by nothing more than a chimney at the next hou&s;e.</P>
<P>On running up &s;tairs in my fright, I there found my good &s;i&s;ter, whom I had imagined to be out, which added to what <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> had &s;aid, rais'd in my brea&s;t &s;ome thoughts, not much to her honour or hu|manity, however, I thought proper to keep them to my&s;elf for the pre&s;ent&punc; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ermining to be more circum&s;pect for the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"></P>

<P>In pur&s;uance of this determination, &s;he in&s;tantly wrote a note, wherein &s;he acquainted him with her re&s;olution, though, as I have &s;ince been informed, &s;he took care that he &s;hould never receive it.</P>
<P>Thus by this well-counterfeited anger, did &s;he in|tirely hu&s;h my former &s;u&s;picions, and I really be|lieved, that &s;he had no concern in the plot; though I am now convinced, it was a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> contri|vance of her own to ruin me; but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> affectionate cordiality of her behaviour, would not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;uffer me to entertain any thoughts injurious to her honour; and I was again giving my&s;elf up to the enjoyment of that golden dream of happine&s;s, which my luxu|rious fancy had painted, when my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> peace of mind, was at once de&s;troyed, by the cruel artifices, of that ba&s;e de&s;igning woman, under who&s;e protec|tion

<P>When we came out of the theatre, to my great &s;ur|prize, the &s;ervant who had been ordered to meet us, was not to be found; and having looked for him &s;ome time in vain, lea&s;t I &s;hould catch cold, by coming immediately from &s;o inten&s;e heat, into the night air; my officious &s;i&s;ter in&s;i&s;ted on my &s;tepping into an ad|joining tavern, till a coach could be called, which I was too ea&s;ily induced to agree to: and thus, under the hypocritical mark of friend&s;hip, and an affect|ed concern for my welfare, did &s;he &s;educe me to my ruin.</P>
<P>To my unutterable a&s;toni&s;hment, I found that &s;he was extremely well known at the hou&s;e, and being at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words">, conducted into a room, &s;ome wine was brought, of which I unluckily drank a gla&s;s or two, but do not remember any thing farther which pa&s;&s;ed that night.</P>

<P>Having waited &s;ometime in expectation of her an|&s;wer, &s;he at la&s;t cried in a pre&s;umptuous tone:&mdash;"Very well, Sir&mdash;this is a good, a very plau&s;ible ex|cu&s;e, and had you thought of it &s;ooner, I might have been a dupe to your mean &s;ubterfuge,&mdash;but I can now &s;ee through &s;o poor, &s;o &s;hallow an artifice; I &s;ee that I am di&s;agreeable to you,&mdash;but &s;ince you have had the audacity to provoke my re&s;entment; beware the con&s;equences,&mdash;dread the anger of a &s;lighted woman: good heaven! that I &s;hould ever &s;ubject my&s;elf to a refu&s;al from my own &s;lave."</P>

<P>Sir Charles &s;tood between them both, in the greate&s;t perplexity, not knowing what to imagine from &s;o extraordinary an accident;&mdash;however, he did not remain long in this uncertainty: for when Melvill came to him&s;elf&mdash;&s;tarting up he cried&mdash;"It is, it is Maria;" and was running to catch the &s;tran|ger in his arms&mdash;when woe-fraught recollection, &s;tinging him like an adder&mdash;he retreated, and fixing his eyes in frightful &s;tillne&s;s, exclaimed, "Yes, you are indeed Maria&mdash;but&mdash;" what? not Maria Har|try,

<P>Melvill being now &s;omewhat compos'd, our he|roine di&s;clo&s;ed to him every circum&s;tance, which the reader has before heard&mdash;though it was not till after a long while, that he could be per&s;uaded of the truth of what he heard.</P>

The&s;e indeed appeared almo&s;t as mi|racles to both our heroes; yet notwith&s;tanding, the mea&s;ure of their joy was now completely full, Sir Charles could not refrain from dropping a tear, as a tribute due to the memory of his father: nor did Melvill forget to &s;ympathize with two &s;uch friends for their lo&s;s.

<P>Sure never were found a happier &s;et of people! if our heroines were hand&s;ome, when their hu&s;bands fir&s;t knew them, they were now more exqui&s;itely &s;o, as time had brought to perfection tho&s;e beauties which were then but in the blo&s;&s;om.</P>
