<P>_THE words are a moving Exhortation from GOD to a provoking People, who&s;e multiplied and hai|nous Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions had ripened them for the Ven|geance of Heaven, and for Di&s;olating Judgments. If we look back to the preceeding Chapter, we &s;hall find a heavy Charge drawn up again&s;t a Profe&s;&s;ing People of GOD, as an Evidence of their woful Apo&s;tacy
<PB N="2" REF="002709_0005_0FE5F2F4D55E7D50">
and Declen&s;ion: Yea their Ca&s;e is repre&s;ented as if there was &s;carce a Godly Man to be found among them all. Ver.I. <HI>Run ye to and fro through the Streets of Jeru&s;alem, and &s;ee now and know, and &s;eek in the Broad places thereof, if ye can find a man, if there be any that executeth Judgment, that &s;eeketh the Truth, and I will pardon it.</HI> A <HI>&s;ad Ca&s;e</HI> truly, if there were not one &s;uch to be found. <HI>Jeru|&s;alem</HI> would then be wor&s;e than <HI>Sodom</HI> that was de&s;troyed by Fire from Heaven, for even there a Righteous <HI>Lot</HI> was found. But doubt|le&s;s the Words are to be taken not ab&s;olutely, but in a comparative &s;en&s;e, to denote the few|ne&s;s of the Godly there, and the general Cor|ruption reigning among all Ranks and Orders of Men. More particularly, they are Articled again&s;t for their <HI>fal&s;e &s;wearing, their Incorri|giblene&s;s under the Judgments of God, their Idolatry and Adultery, their contempt of God's Word and Prophets, together with their criminal regardle&s;sne&s;s of him who&s;e Power is great, and for which he is to be feared, their Deceit, In|ju&s;tice &amp; Violence, and delight in fal&s;e Prophets.</HI> The <HI>Prophets prophe&s;y fal&s;ely, and the Prie&s;ts bear rule by their means, and my people love to have it &s;o.</HI> And in the mid&s;t of the&s;e Charges we have once and again &s;uch &s;harp Interroga|tories, as one would think &s;hould have awaken|ed and wounded them. <HI>How &s;hall I Pardon thee for this? Shall I not vi&s;it for the&s;e things? &s;aith the Lord: and &s;hall not my &s;oul be aven|ged on &s;uch a nation as this? Hear ye not me?

&s;aith the Lord: Will ye not tremble at my pre|&s;ence? And again, Shall I not vi&s;it for the&s;e things? &s;aith the Lord: Shall not my &s;oul be a|venged on &s;uch a Nation as this?</HI> In this Chap|ter therefore we find a ju&s;tly offended GOD giving a Commi&s;&s;ion to the <HI>Chaldeans</HI> the E|nemies of His People, to go up again&s;t and de|&s;troy them for their very great Wickedne&s;s: which Commi&s;&s;ion, with the ground and rea&s;on of it, we have opened, Ver. 6, 7. <HI>Thus hath the Lord of Ho&s;ts &s;aid, Hew ye down Trees, and ca&s;t amount again&s;t Jeru&s;alem: this is the City to be vi&s;ited, &s;he is wholly oppre&s;&s;ion in the mid&s;t of her. As a Fountain ca&s;teth out her waters, &s;o &s;he ca&s;teth out her wickedne&s;s: Violence and &s;poil is heard in her, before me continually is grief and wounds.</HI> Thus is <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> con|victed and threatned. Neverthele&s;s, &s;uch are the Compa&s;&s;ions of a Merciful GOD, that before he brings the threatned Ruin upon a &s;inful People, he will give them warning and advi&s;e them of their Danger; that they may Repent of their wickedne&s;s, and thereby pre|vent the evil coming upon them, which he threatens to do unto them.</P>
<P><HI>BE thou In&s;tructed, O Jeru&s;alem</HI>; or as it is in the Original, <HI>Be thou Corrected, O Jeru&s;a|lem: i.e.</HI> <Q>By the Correction thou ha&s;t felt already, and which is further threatned, Be per&s;waded to Repentance before it be too late.</Q> Let the Rod and Reproof teach thee Wi&s;dom. Nor were they at any lo&s;s what to do in this
<PB N="4" REF="002709_0007_0FE5F2F5B20AEDA8">
Ca&s;e, being well enough acquainted with what GOD tells them by this Prophet, Chap. 18.7, 8. <HI>At what In&s;tant I &s;hall &s;peak concerning a Na|tion and concerning a Kingdom, to pluck up, and to pull down and to de&s;troy it: If that Na|tion again&s;t whom I have pronounced, turn from their evil, I will repent of the evil that I thought to do unto them.</HI></P>
<P><HI>LEST my Soul depart from thee</HI>; or ac|cording to the Marginal Reading of our Bibles, be <HI>loo&s;ed</HI> or <HI>disjointed</HI> from thee: which doubtle&s;s, as our Engli&s;h Annotatours ob&s;erve, <Q>is a Metaphor taken from the Dislocation of a Limb, the loo&s;ing it from it's natural Place and Po&s;ture, and putting it, as we &s;ay, <HI>out of Joynt</HI>: intimating what a Pain and Grief it is to GOD to leave or ca&s;t off a People, whom he hath taken into Covenant with him&s;elf, and with how much difficulty he is drawn thereunto.</Q></P>
<P><HI>LEST I make thee De&s;olate, a Land not Inhabited.</HI> Le&s;t I both ca&s;t thee off, and cut thee off. So that the Exhortation is grounded upon the mo&s;t Important and weighty Con&s;i|derations Imaginable.</P>
<P>THERE are Four Doctrines I &s;hall offer you and briefly &s;peak to from the Words.</P>
<P><HI>DOCT.</HI> I. THAT the <HI>Happine&s;s</HI> of a Peo|ple con&s;i&s;ts in having the <HI>Gracious Pre|&s;ence</HI> of GOD with them.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="002709_0008_0FE610239635FD48"><HI>DOCT.</HI> II. THAT GOD is not &s;o engaged to any People, but that upon Ju&s;t Provo|cation given him, his <HI>Soul</HI> may <HI>Depart</HI> from them.</P>
<P><HI>DOCT.</HI> III. THAT the <HI>Departure of GOD</HI> from a People, opens a Door for <HI>De&s;ola|ting Judgments</HI> to enter in upon them.</P>
<P><HI>DOCT.</HI> IV. THAT it is both the <HI>Duty &amp; Intere&s;t</HI> of a People, to do all that in them lies, to prevent &s;o great a Calamity, as the Departure of GOD's Soul <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> them will certainly carry in it.</P>
<P>DOCT. <HI>I.</HI> THAT <HI>the happine&s;s of a People con&s;i&s;ts in having the gracious</HI> Pre&s;ence <HI>of GOD with them.</HI></P>
<P>THIS Doctrine, tho' not expre&s;s'd, is yet ne|ce&s;&s;arily implied in the Words. For if the Departure of GOD from a People be threatned as the &s;ore&s;t Judgment that can befal them, and they be earne&s;tly called upon to u&s;e their ut|mo&s;t endeavours to prevent it, then nothing can be more plain than that his gracious Pre|&s;ence with them is their Happine&s;s and Glory.</P>
<P>AND this is a Truth very ea&s;ily proved and evidenced. It is not the Confluence of all the Ble&s;&s;ings of Providence, the abounding of Peace. Plenty, and every other common Mercy de&s;i|rable, that does &s;o denominate a People Happy, as the having <HI>GOD with them</HI>; who&s;e Pre|&s;ence is <HI>All in All</HI> to their <HI>Felicity</HI>: Their
<PB N="6" REF="002709_0009_0FE60FDE2C95E8F0">
<HI>Decus ac Tutamen</HI>; their Ornament and Safety, their Defence and Glory. This is the compre|hen&s;ive Sum of all GOD's gracious Promi&s;es to his People, as he told <HI>Jo&s;hua,</HI> Chap. 1.5. <HI>I will be with thee: I will not &s;ail thee, nor for&s;ake thee.</HI> Yea we find the Phra&s;e &s;ometimes u&s;ed as expre&s;&s;ive of all the Good that need to be re|que&s;ted for. Thus by Pious <HI>Jacob,</HI> Gen. 28.20. <HI>If God will be with we, and will keep me in the way that I go.</HI> What Benediction can be more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> than that, <HI>The Great G0D be with</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">. Every Ble&s;&s;ing is included in &s;uch a Wi&s;h. Thus <HI>Boaz</HI> came from <HI>Bethlehem,</HI> and &s;aid unto his Reapers, <HI>The Lord be with you</HI>: And they to be even with him in Ble&s;&s;ing, an|&s;wered, <HI>The Lord ble&s;s thee,</HI> Ruth 2.4. With this al&s;o we find good old <HI>I&s;rael</HI> comforting his Sons a little before his Death; Gen. 48.21. And I&s;rael &s;aid, Behold I die: but <HI>G0D &s;hall be with you.</HI> So that the be&s;t thing which GOD can Promi&s;e, or we can de&s;ire, either for our &s;elves or others, is, <HI>That GOD will be with us and them.</HI> Agreable whereto is that Prayer of <HI>Solomon,</HI> at the Dedication of the Temple, I. Kings 8.57 <HI>The Lord our God be with us, as he was with our Fathers: let him not leave us, nor for&s;ake us.</HI> If the Divine Pre&s;ence be once obtained, all other Ble&s;&s;ings both Temporal and Spiritual will be con&s;equent thereupon.</P>
<P>Particularly,</P>
<P><HI>IF GOD be with a People,</HI> he will favour them with all that <HI>Guidance, Conduct and Di|rection</HI> that they need. It is one Character given;
<PB N="7" REF="002709_0010_0FE60FFB33EBA428">
of the Ble&s;&s;ed GOD, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 84.11. For the Lord God is a <HI>Sun.</HI> And when he is thus &s;tiled in reference to his People, it denotes that he will afford them all that <HI>Light &amp; Direction,</HI> which their <HI>Darkne&s;s</HI> &amp; <HI>Difficulties</HI> may render need|ful for them: That he will in&s;truct and teach them in the way which they &s;hould go, and guide them with his eye; that when their way is hedg'd up with thorns, and their Perplexities &s;uch that they know not what to do, he will acquaint them with their Duty, and make their way plain before them.</P>
<P>Again, <HI>GOD's Pre&s;ence</HI> with a People &s;up|po&s;es that he will both <HI>Support under, and ex|tricate them out of their Difficulties</HI>: That his Wi&s;dom, Power and Goodne&s;s &s;hall be &s;ingu|larly concern'd and employ'd for them; that he will be to them a pre&s;ent help in every time of trouble to &s;upport them under their Burdens; yea that in the mount of their Diffi|culties he will be &s;een, working Deliverance and Salvation for them. And O that in the&s;e re&s;pects there were more vi&s;ible tokens of GOD's <HI>Gracious Pre&s;ence</HI> with this People!</P>
<P>Again, <HI>GOD's being</HI> with a People implies his <HI>Pro&s;pering and giving Succe&s;s to all their lawful Undertakings.</HI> We read concerning <HI>Jo|&s;eph,</HI> Gen. 39.23. <HI>The Lord was with him: and that which he did, the lord made it to pro&s;per.</HI> And of <HI>Uzziah,</HI> 2 Chron. 26.5. <HI>That as long as he &s;ought the Lord, God made him to pro&s;per.</HI>
<PB N="8" REF="002709_0011_0FE60FE0C3437AD0">
The Succe&s;s of all endeavours is from the Lord alone, and if a People once engage the Pre|&s;ence of GOD with them, they may be a&s;&s;ured of all kind of Pro&s;perity. Salvation then will in every re&s;pect be nigh unto them, and Glory dwell in the Land.</P>
<P>I might further have &s;aid, That where <HI>GOD is pre&s;ent with a People,</HI> he will mul|tiply <HI>Spiritual Ble&s;&s;ings</HI> al&s;o upon them. He will be <HI>graciou&s;ly pre&s;ent</HI> with his <HI>own Ordi|nances,</HI> and give abundant Succe&s;s to the Means of Grace. He will <HI>pour his Spirit upon the Seed</HI> of his People, <HI>and his ble&s;&s;ing upon their Offspring</HI>: Yea &s;uch &s;hall be the remarkable &s;miles of Heaven upon them, that all &s;hall take Notice, That they are <HI>a People whom the Lord hath Ble&s;&s;ed.</HI> This and much more than this is implied in the <HI>Pre&s;ence of GOD</HI> with a People; and if &s;o, we may well draw up the P&s;almi&s;ts's Conclu&s;ion, P&s;al. 144, ult. <HI>Happy is the People that is in &s;uch a ca&s;e: yea, Happy is that People who&s;e God is the Lord.</HI> And may I not &s;ay, that GOD is thus with a People, and will continue to be &s;o as long as they con|tinue Faithful to him? 2 Chron. 15.2. <HI>Hear ye me, A&s;a, and all Judah and Benjamin. The Lord is with you, while ye he him.</HI> Hag 2.4. <HI>Yet now be &s;trong, O Zerubbabe, &s;aith the Lord, and be &s;trong, O Jo&s;hua, &s;on of Jo&s;edech the High Prie&s;t, &amp; be &s;trong, all ye people of the land &s;aith the Lord and work: for I am with you, &s;aith the Lord of Ho&s;ts.</HI> And the People of GOD may while they keep clo&s;e to their Duty, glory
<PB N="9" REF="002709_0012_0FE6100200B2BDD0">
in this, and triumph over all the Difficulties and Dangers that may await them, as the Church does, P&s;al. 46. ult. <HI>The Lord of Ho&s;ts is with us; the God of Jacob is our Refuge. Selub.</HI></P>
<P>DOCT, II <HI>THAT GOD is not &s;o </HI>enga|ged<HI> to any People, but that upon ju&s;t Pro|vocation given him, his Soul may</HI> depart <HI>from them.</HI></P>
<P>THE People of the <HI>Jews</HI> were once the on|ly Profe&s;&s;ing People that GOD had in the World; a People whom he cho&s;e to him&s;elf above all People that were upon the Face of the Earth, and upon whom he be&s;towed &s;pecial Marks of his Favour. Neverthele&s;s the&s;e he warns, to take Care le&s;t by their un&s;uitable Carriage they &s;hould provoke him to abandon and ca&s;t them off; left his <HI>Soul</HI> &s;hould depart from them: Which Phra&s;e imports not only his &s;u&s;pending the former manife&s;tations of his Love; but even his utter loathing and abhor|rence of them.</P>
<P>For clearing this, I &s;hall</P>
<P N="1">I. SHOW <HI>when</HI> a People may be &s;aid to <HI>provoke</HI> GOD to depart from them.</P>
<P N="2">II. THAT upon &s;uch Provocation given, <HI>his Soul may depart</HI> from them.</P>
<P N="1">I. I am to &s;how <HI>when a People may be &s;aid to provoke G0D to depart from them.</HI></P>
<P>AND altho' it be true that all Sins are di&s;|plea&s;ing to GOD, and what his Soul hates you
<PB N="10" REF="002709_0013_0FE60FE0D045B5E0">
there are &s;ome particular Evils which are more provoking, and have a more direct tendency to cau&s;e him to depart. I'll In&s;tance here only in a few of them; and hint at &s;ome others af|terward.</P>
<P N="1">1. A <HI>Low E&s;teem of the Pre&s;ence of GOD with a People,</HI> will be a ju&s;t Provocation to him to depart from them. If that which is the highe&s;t Favour of GOD to a People be under|valued and meanly accounted of by them, how Ju&s;t mu&s;t it be with him to take the &s;ame from them, that they may learn to know the worth of it by the want thereof? What Per&s;on would burden others with his Company, that neither value nor de&s;ire it? Now this is too often the Ca&s;e of a Profe&s;&s;ing People with re&s;pect to the gracious Pre&s;ence of GOD with them. They don't &s;et that Value upon it, which the Excel|lency of the Ble&s;&s;ing calls for: they are not &s;o Thankful for it when enjoyed, as they ought to be: they are not &s;o de&s;irous of the Continuance of it, as indeed they &s;hould be: nor are they &s;o concerned at the awful Tokens of it's withdraw from them, as it might be rea|&s;onably expected they would be: not yet &s;o Prayerful to him as the &s;olemn Di&s;pen&s;ation calls upon them to be like him, P&s;al. 90.13, 15. <HI>Return, O Lord, how long? and let it repent thee concerning thy Servants. Make us glad according to the days wherein thou ha&s;t afflicted us, and the years wherein we have &s;een evil.</HI> When a People are &s;o regardle&s;s of the Pre&s;ence of GOD, and look upon it as a matter
<PB N="11" REF="002709_0014_0FE61023A12C2830">
of Indifferency whether they are favour'd with it or not, no wonder if a Jealous GOD be pro|voked to withdraw the &s;ame from them. Here is Ju&s;t Provocation given him to depart.</P>
<P N="2">2. A <HI>Departure from the Pure In&s;tituted Wor&s;hip of GOD</HI> will provoke him to Depart. The Glorious GOD who is the &s;ole Object of Religious Wor&s;hip, has given &s;ufficient Directi|on in his Word, how he will be Wor&s;hipped by his Creatures. And to Wor&s;hip him after a way of our own devi&s;ing, will be found very provoking to him, who is a GOD Jealous for him&s;elf and his own Glory. Now as to a Pro|fe&s;&s;ing People, it is but rea&s;onably &s;uppo&s;ed that they have been in&s;tructed in the Purity of Divine Wor&s;hip; that unto them has been &s;hown the Form of GOD's Hou&s;e, and the Fa&s;hion thereof, and the goings out thereof, and the comings in thereof, with all the Or|dinances and Laws thereof. (<HI>Ezek.</HI> 43.11.) That they have often been urged to hold fa&s;t the form of &s;ound words, and contend earne&s;tly for the Faith delivered to the Saints: to re|member how they have received and heard, and hold fa&s;t: and beware le&s;t being led away with the Error of the Wicked, they &s;hould fall from their own &s;tedfa&s;tne&s;s. To leave then the Com|mandments of GOD for the Traditions of Men, and introduce tho&s;e Ceremonies into his Wor&s;hip, and add tho&s;e Inventions of our own thereto which he never Commanded, will be found a plain encroachment upon the Divine
<PB N="12" REF="002709_0015_0FE60FE8386E1B20">
Prerogative. And &s;uch as are guilty in this re|&s;pect would do well to con&s;ider what An&s;wer they &s;hall give in to GOD another Day, when he &s;hall demand of them, as in I&s;a. 1.12. <HI>Who hath required this at your hands?</HI> Matth. 15.8, 9. <HI>This People draweth nigh unto me with their mouth and honoureth me with their lips: but their heart is far from me. But in Vain they do wor&s;hip me, teaching for Doctrines the</HI> Commandments <HI>of Men.</HI> This will be look'd upon as a Departure from GOD.</P>
<P N="3">3. AN <HI>un&s;uitable Carriage towards G0D's Me&s;&s;engers &amp; Servants,</HI> will have a dreadful tendency to provoke him to Depart from a People. Where his Go&s;pel is priz d, and his Servants meet with a kind Entertainment, with &s;uch a People GOD will continue his gracious Pre&s;ence. With them he has given his Servants Orders to abide; and a Temporal Ble&s;&s;ing has been wont to go along with the Go&s;pel. But if a People grow cold in their Affections to Divine Truths, and mi&s;u&s;e the Me&s;&s;engers of the Lord, he who has &s;ent them, will look upon it as a Contempt ca&s;t upon him|&s;elf, which he will not bear. There were ma|ny crying abominations in <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI>; but yet her De&s;truction &s;eems to bear Date from the prevailing of this Sin. 2 Chron. 36.15, 16. <HI>And the Lord God of their Fathers &s;ent to them by his Me&s;&s;engers, ri&s;ing up betimes, and &s;end|ing them, becau&s;e he had compa&s;&s;ion on his people, and on his dwelling place. But they mocked
<PB N="13" REF="002709_0016_0FE61025B59B1560">
the Me&s;&s;engers of God, and de&s;pi&s;ed his words, and mi&s;u&s;ed his Prophets, until the wrath of the Lord ari&s;e again&s;t his People, till there was no Remedy.</HI> Be thou <HI>In&s;tructed,</HI> O NEW-ENG|LAND, and let <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI>'s Ruine be a Warn|ing to thee.</P>
<P>Felix quem faciunt aliena pericula cantum.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>INCORRIGIBLENESS under the Judgments of G0D</HI> has al&s;o a direct tendency to provoke him to depart. This we find to be an Article in the heavy Indictment brought in again&s;t that People, whom God in the Text calls upon to be In&s;tructed, left his Soul depart from them. Jer 53. <HI>O Lord, thou ha&s;t &s;tricken them, but they have not grieved: thou ha&s;t con&s;umed them, but they have refu&s;ed to receive correction: they have made their faces harder than a Rock, they have refu&s;ed to return. l&s;a, 42.25. He hath poured upon him the fury of his anger, and the &s;trength of Battel; and it hath &s;et him on fire round about, yet he know not, and it burned him, yet he laid it not to heart.</HI> The De&s;ign of GOD in the Calamities he brings upon his People is to humble, reform and do them good: whereas if the&s;e prove ineffectual to reclaim them, if in the very face of Judg|iments, they will continue to provoke him, what can be expected, but that being grieved for the hardne&s;s of their heart, he &s;hould withdraw from them?

<P N="6">6. <HI>DECAYS in Religion,</HI> as to the life and power of it, have a &s;ad tendency to provoke GOD to Depart from a People.

<P>WHEN GOD departs from a People he throws down the Wall of his gracious <HI>Protection</HI> over them.

<P>DOCT. <HI>IV.</HI> IT is both the <HI>Duty</HI> and <HI>In|tere&s;t</HI> of a People to do all that in them lies to <HI>prevent</HI> &s;o great a Calamity, as the Departure of GOD's Soul from them will will certainly carry in it.</P>

Infinite in his Patience, and endureth with much long-&s;uffering, being loath to leave and give them over to Ruin.

He gives a People timely notice of it, that &s;o they may &s;tir up them&s;elves to take hold of a Departing GOD.</P>
<P>THUS he dealt with <HI>Judah.</HI> Ezek. 9.3. <HI>The Glory of GOD</HI> goes fir&s;t from the <HI>Cherub,</HI> to the <HI>Thre|&s;hold of the Hou&s;e</HI>; and &s;tays there, as if it had a mind to be invited back again: then it goes from the <HI>Thre&s;hold of the Hou&s;e,</HI> and &s;tands over the <HI>Cherubims,</HI> as if upon a penitent Call, it would drop down again to it's antient Station and Seat, over which it hovered, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 10.18.

As the Learned Mr. <HI>Charnock</HI> ob&s;erves upon the Places.</P>
<P>NOW to be <HI>In&s;tructed,</HI> in the &s;en&s;e of the Text, is for a People to take Notice of the fir&s;t Tokens of GOD's going from them, and to be humbled under the &s;en&s;e of it: to &s;ee his hand lifted up, &s;ee it and be afraid, trembling at the Thoughts of his Departure from them.</P>

<P N="1">1. FROM what has been &s;aid we learn upon <HI>whom</HI> a People are to lay the <HI>blame,</HI> in ca&s;e GOD &s;hould at any time depart from them. He never breaks fir&s;t with them; but in ca&s;e they would continue Faithful to their Engage|ments with him, he would ever be mindful of his Covenant for them. P&s;al. 105.8, <HI>&amp;c. He hath remembred his Covenant for ever; the word which he commanded to a thou&s;and Genera|tions. Which Covenant he made with Abraham, and his Oath unto I&s;aac; and confirmed the &s;ame unto Jacob for a Law, and to I&s;rael for an Everlasting Covenant: &s;aying., unto thee will I give the Land of Canaan.</HI> And notwith&s;tand|ing the manifold Rebellions and Provocations of that &s;inful People, for which he did puni&s;h them in the Wilderne&s;s; yet had he a re&s;pect unto his Promi&s;e and fulfill'd it. Hence <HI>Jo&s;hua</HI> appeals to their very Con&s;ciences for the Proof of this, Jo&s;h. 23.14. <HI>Ye know in all your hearts, and in all your &s;ouls, that not one thing hath

And therefore whatever the &s;orrow|ful Effects may be of GOD's Soul's Departing from them, they can blame none but <HI>them|&s;elves,</HI> and mu&s;t charge the whole Fault upon their own Prevarications and treacherous Deal|ings in his Covenant. So <HI>I&s;rael</HI> of old were forced to do. 1 Sam. 12.10. <HI>They cried unto the Lord, and &s;aid, We have &s;inned, becau&s;e we have for&s;aken the Lord.</HI> Dan. 9.11. <HI>Yea all</HI> I&s;rael <HI>have tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed thy Law, even by departing, that they might not obey thy voice: therefore the Cur&s;e is poured upon us, and the Oath that is written in the Law of</HI> Mo&s;es <HI>the Servant of God, becau&s;e we have &s;inned again&s;t him.&mdash;O Lord, Righteou&s;ne&s;s belongeth unto thee, but unto us Confu&s;ion of faces as at this Day.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. MAY GOD's Soul Depart from a Profe&s;|&s;ing People?

And yet thus it was with the People of the <HI>Jews</HI>: becau&s;e GOD had cho&s;en them a|bove all other People, and taken them near to him&s;elf, they would not believe, that ever he would reject them, tho' they were guilty of the gro&s;&s;e&s;t abominations.

He will as the Prophet's Expre&s;&s;ion is, Zech. 11.10. <HI>Cut a&s;under the &s;taff, even</HI> Beauty, <HI>that he may break his Cove|nant which he had made with the People.</HI> It is O|bedience and Faithfulne&s;s to GOD, that will en|gage, his Pre&s;ence with a People, and not any Profe&s;&s;ion or Covenant Relation, that they may make, or &s;tand in to him.</P>
<P N="3">3.
