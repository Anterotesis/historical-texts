<HEAD>ON SLEEP AND DREAMS.</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;ubject of SLEEP, like many other &s;ubjects in medicine, cannot be reduced to the principles of ma|thematical certainty; but, that it may be illu&s;trated by a complete induction of the effects of all the exciting powers producing &s;leep, I imagine, will not be denied.</P>
<P>"SLEEP, without dreaming," &s;ays Mr. Locke, <Q>is re&s;t from all &s;tudy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">On the Human Under&s;tanding.</NOTE></Q> of the mind and operation of the animal functions of the body. In "<HI>&s;leep</HI>", when "quite complete," &s;ays Dr. Cullen, <Q>the motion and mobility of the nervous power, with re&s;pect to the whole of what are called the animal functions, en|tirely cea&s;e; or, as I would expre&s;s it, are in a &s;tate of <HI>collap&s;e,</HI> and are very different from the &s;tate of waking, which, in healthy per&s;ons, I would call a &s;tate of general and entire excitement<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Fir&s;t Lines of the Practice of Phy&s;ic, vol. iv. pag. 127.</NOTE>.</Q> That there is a certain degree of excitement, nece&s;&s;arily ex|i&s;ting in the animal &s;y&s;tem, to con&s;titute perfect and uninterrupted health, is agreed on by all. There mu&s;t al&s;o be, I conceive, a certain point, or degree, of ex|citement, different from the foregoing, favouring pro|found &s;leep, which is produced by certain powers ope|rating on the living property inherent in every animal. This property has received different names, from diffe|rent authors. It is called by Baron Haller the <HI>vis in|&s;ita;</HI> by Dr. Cullen, the <HI>nervous power;</HI> by Mr. John Hunter,
<PB N="8" REF="023290_0005_0FBEE5F81C418928">
<HI>&s;timulability;</HI> and by Dr. Brown, <HI>the excitabi|lity.</HI> The exciting powers acting on the excitability, producing excitement favourable to health, and in|viting &s;leep, if carried beyond their proper bounda|ries, or withheld, occa&s;ion morbid &s;leep, di&s;ea&s;e, and even death it&s;elf. The <HI>&s;leep-inviting point,</HI> or that de|gree of excitement nece&s;&s;ary to con&s;titute profound &s;leep, appears to exi&s;t in a kind of indirect debility of the &s;y&s;tem, or partially-exhau&s;ted excitability to the powers producing it, which it is very difficult to ex|plain. <Q>Sleep, then, is the effect of the actions of the day, at fir&s;t always giving more and more ex|citement, but le&s;s and le&s;s in proportion to the con|tinuance of their operation, but in &s;uch a &s;ort as al|ways to add &s;ome excitement, till at la&s;t the matter comes to a point, where the degree of excitement nece&s;&s;ary to con&s;titute the waking &s;tate no longer ex|i&s;ts.</Q> Every day's experience teaches us the effects of the exciting powers, in producing &s;leep: It teaches us, that, if they are applied in exce&s;s, or, though mo|derate, are long continued, they run the excitement on to actual indirect debility, and occa&s;ion <HI>morbid &s;leep.</HI> And, that &s;leep may be brought on &s;ooner or later, by the exce&s;&s;ive or deficient application of the cau&s;es pro|ducing it, is certain. By all unu&s;ual exertions, tho&s;e unaccu&s;tomed to fatigue, &amp;c. will have their &s;leep hur|ried or produced &s;ooner than in common, and it is ge|nerally of the morbid kind.</P>
<P>A MAN of &s;cience and of genius, in the pur&s;uit of mental acquirement, &s;timulated by the &s;pirit of emu|lation, or any other exciting emotion, will have his excitability con&s;iderably wa&s;ted, and his excitement increa&s;ed beyond the point con&s;tituting <HI>profound &s;leep,</HI> but favouring the waking &s;tate; and this &s;tate may be kept up, or rendered more tolerable, a con&s;iderable time, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the diffu&s;ible, together with the durable, &s;timuli, given at proper intervals, and changed frequently in kind, and in quantity, and ac|commodated

to the excitability then exi&s;ting in the &s;y&s;tem, favouring the waking &s;tate<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Dr. Brown's Elements of Medicine, in note of &sect; xxxi,</NOTE>.</P>
<P>I THINK it has been &s;ufficiently proven, that the cau&s;es producing <HI>profound &s;leep,</HI> or <HI>&s;leep without dream|ing,</HI> deprive the mind of reflex-&s;en&s;ation. Mr. Locke (on the Human Under&s;tanding, in the fir&s;t volume) ob&s;erves, that the <HI>&s;oul</HI> does not think during profound &s;leep, and that this cannot be proven, as there appears to have been a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of time to the &s;leeping man. The Chevalier Ram&s;ay ob&s;erves, <Q>It is fal&s;e to maintain, with the Carte&s;ians, that the <HI>&s;oul</HI> thinks always. They never did, nor can, give any &s;olid rea&s;on for this a&s;|&s;ertion. Experience &s;hows the contrary, when we are in a &s;woon, or in deep &s;leep. To think, know, and feel always, are privileges of a pure and unfallen &s;tate, when the living images &s;hall have a perfect re|&s;emblance to him who never &s;lumbers. This is one of the principal changes made in nature &s;ince the fall, and a law e&s;tabli&s;hed in the &s;phere of lap&s;ed &s;ouls.</Q></P>
<P>THE rea&s;on why children &s;leep &s;o much, has been &s;uppo&s;ed, by &s;ome, to be owing to their wanting reflex-&s;en&s;ation. May not the phaenomenon of &s;leep in chil|dren be explained upon other phy&s;ical cau&s;es, and not upon the want of reflex-&s;en&s;ation? That the excita|bility of a child is more abundant, cannot, or will not, I imagine, be denied; and from this I may ju&s;tly in|fer, that the waking and &s;leeping &s;tates of children do more ea&s;ily run into each other than they do in adults. Their excitability, therefore, is more &s;u&s;ceptible of the action of &s;timuli of every kind, and the &s;leep-inviting point is, con&s;equently, produced, or brought on, &s;ooner in children, by fewer cau&s;es, in a given time, than in adults.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="023290_0007_0FBEE5FB4ADD5F40">
A PATIENT in a convale&s;cent &s;tate of a typhus-fever is con&s;iderably debilitated, and very excitable to any &s;timulus over-proportioned to the abundant excitability then exi&s;ting in the &s;y&s;tem. The point at which &s;leep begins is &s;ooner produced by &s;timulant powers, and the waking &s;tate is likewi&s;e &s;ooner brought back; the in|tervals between the two &s;tages of &s;leeping and waking are of le&s;s duration, and &s;leep is le&s;s profound than in a &s;tate of perfect and uninterrupted health<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This idea may be extended to the female &s;ex, as their original &s;tamina, and the life they pur&s;ue, render them more delicate, and, of con&s;equence, their excitability more abundant, than in the male. If the&s;e rea&s;ons be ad|mitted as phy&s;ically true, which, I think, will be readily agreed to, it will help to enforce the validity of the a&s;&s;ertion, that the intellectual faculties of the female are more &s;u&s;ceptible to impre&s;&s;ions, their imagination more lively than that of the male; and the rea&s;on why there are more wits among the for|mer than among the latter.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE &s;udden tran&s;ition from &s;leeping to waking, and <HI>vice ver&s;a,</HI> is more ob&s;ervable in &s;ome per&s;ons, under certain circum&s;tances, than in others; and the&s;e &s;ud|den changes may apply to the above-mentioned ca&s;es. It has been ob&s;erved in other per&s;ons, that the approach of &s;leeping and of waking is more gradual, and, in the&s;e ca&s;es, the <Q>ears are often awake before the eyes are opened, or &s;ee clearly, and the &s;en&s;es are often awake before the power of voluntary motion is reco|vered.</Q> From the theory of &s;leep which I have en|deavoured to e&s;tabli&s;h, may not the&s;e facts be re&s;olved upon the &s;ame phy&s;ical cau&s;es partially influencing the &s;y&s;tem, and producing an unequal excitement and mor|bid &s;leep?</P>
<P>IN a <HI>typhus mitior,</HI> the patient &s;leeps much, with a kind of &s;tertorous breathing, and is ea&s;ily wakened by an addre&s;s not louder than common; withholding it, he &s;oon falls into an involuntary &s;leep. This kind of &s;leep, for the mo&s;t part, is the con&s;equence of a certain degree of debility, produced by &s;ome powers acting with con&s;iderable &s;timulant effect; the rea&s;on is, this &s;leep depends upon le&s;s debility than that which con&s;ti|tutes
<PB N="11" REF="023290_0008_0FBEE5FD0160FF30">
the di&s;ea&s;e. How does it come about, that every thing which &s;timulates produces that effect by its &s;ti|mulant, and not by its &s;edative, virtue? Let tho&s;e ac|cu&s;tomed to all the cau&s;es producing the <HI>&s;leep-inviting point,</HI> be removed from the&s;e cau&s;es, and expo&s;ed to the directly-debilitating powers, as darkne&s;s, &s;ilence, cold, re&s;t, and ab&s;tinence; the&s;e cau&s;es le&s;&s;ening the excitement (and accumulating the excitability), will increa&s;e a di&s;po&s;ition to involuntary morbid &s;leep.</P>
<P>THERE are many facts which may be adduced in proof of this point. Even daily ob&s;ervation furni&s;hes us with arguments in &s;upport of the po&s;ition. Let us turn our attention to the indu&s;trious labourer, who is fatigued from his daily pur&s;uits, expo&s;ed to the &s;timu|lating rays of light, and the noi&s;e of the bu&s;y world, who eats and drinks his hard earnings with a good ap|petite, and lays down to re&s;t, attended with profound, refre&s;hing &s;leep. Dr. Zimmerman &s;ays, <Q>the <HI>&s;oldier &s;leeps</HI> even amid&s;t the thunder of the cannon, when he is worn out with exce&s;&s;ive fatigue<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A Treati&s;e on Experience in Phy&s;ic, vol. ii.</NOTE>.</Q>&mdash;Change the order; give him a day's re&s;t, &s;ilence, darkne&s;s, &amp;c. and he will fall into &s;leep of the morbid, re&s;tle&s;s kind.</P>
<P>THE regular returning time of &s;leeping and waking, is to be explained upon principles &s;imilar to the fore|going, and not upon the effects of habit. Habit is the effect of cau&s;es producing <HI>&s;leep,</HI> and not the cau&s;e of &s;leep; which is too obvious to need any further ex|planation.</P>
<P>FROM what has already been &s;aid, we may explain the rea&s;on why all &s;imple &s;ounds, as the &s;ound of a gentle ca&s;cade, the beating of rain upon a hou&s;e, vocal or in&s;trumental mu&s;ic, induce a di&s;po&s;ition to <HI>&s;leep.</HI> They are to be re&s;olved, likewi&s;e, upon the &s;ame phy|&s;ical principles as all other &s;timuli, producing partial exhau&s;tion of the excitability, and favouring th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;leep-inviting

point, and not upon the effects of &s;ound &s;im|ply preventing reflex-&s;en&s;ation, and cau&s;ing &s;leep.&mdash;Sound and uninterrupted &s;leep refre&s;h the bodily and mental powers, by accumulating, or bringing back, the greatly-wa&s;ted excitability to the &s;timuli of the preced|ing day, and preparing, or fitting it, for the operation of the exciting powers of the &s;ucceeding day.</P>
<P>IN the latter part of night, and towards morning, the excitement is con&s;iderably dimini&s;hed, the body in <HI>&s;ome</HI> degree weakened, and more ea&s;ily affected by any &s;ti|mulus, or hurtful power, that may be applied.</P>
<P>THIS living principle, inherent in the world of ani|mals, upon which all natural &s;timuli exert their effects, in &s;upporting the living exi&s;tence, is not confined to them alone, but is likewi&s;e extended to the vegetable kingdom. The greate&s;t phy&s;iologi&s;t<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Baron Haller.</NOTE> the world has hitherto produced, did not, indeed, admit of <HI>irritability</HI> in vegetables; but the indu&s;try and &s;agacity of the Bo|tani&s;ts have &s;hewn us, that there is a very con&s;iderable number of vegetables, which exhibit &s;igns of irritabi|lity, more or le&s;s obvious in proportion to their age, to their &s;trength, or to the part to which the irritating cau&s;e is applied. This has been ob&s;erved in the leaves and flowers of &s;everal plants. Mr. Bonnet, of Geneva, has, I think, inconte&s;tibly demon&s;trated, that the leaves of vegetables po&s;&s;e&s;s the power of voluntary motion. He has &s;hewn us that the&s;e parts, or organs, always pre|&s;ent their upper &s;urface to the air, and that whenever a branch is turned out of its natural po&s;ition, the leaves of that branch immediately a&s;&s;ume a new direction. May we not venture to add, that the <HI>voluntary</HI> and <HI>in|voluntary motions</HI> of plants are more con&s;picuous, and remarkable in the organs of fructification, e&s;pecially in the <HI>&s;tamina</HI> and <HI>pi&s;tils,</HI> than in the leaves, or any other parts, of vegetables; for in many plants, as &s;oon as the&s;e generative organs have arrived at maturity, the
<PB N="13" REF="023290_0010_0FBEE604BADA6030">
<HI>&s;tamina</HI> embrace the <HI>pi&s;til,</HI> with a &s;eemingly-venereal ap|petite, and di&s;charge their fecundating influence, from the cells of the antherae, upon the female organ&mdash;after this the <HI>&s;tamina</HI> re&s;ume their former po&s;ition, and, in a &s;hort time, pine, wither, and die? The <HI>involuntary</HI> and <HI>voluntary</HI> motions of vegetables, are ob&s;ervable in the <HI>Berberis vulgaris,</HI> or common berberry, and many others; the filaments of the&s;e plants, when touched by a pin, or any other mechanical &s;timulus, are immediately put in motion, and apply them&s;elves to the <HI>pi&s;tillum,</HI> on which they di&s;charge a portion of their fertilizing du&s;t. The wonderful <HI>irritability</HI> of the <HI>&s;tamina</HI> of the <HI>Ci&s;tus Helianthemum</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Dwarf Ci&s;tns, or Little Sun-Flower.</NOTE>, is remarkable, chiefly, about &s;un ri&s;e; in the evening the irritability is nearly extingui&s;hed, and on the following morning, this great, unequivocal, never-failing characteri&s;tic of life, returns again, and &s;o on through the whole cour&s;e of the vegetable life. All vegetables are more irritable in the morning <HI>than in the evening,</HI> to any &s;timuli that may be applied. The leaves of many vegetables, in the day, a&s;&s;ume an ap|pearance very different, from that which they do at night time. They are folded up, or contracted in the night; but in the day time, they are generally expand|ed; and, hence ari&s;es that particular &s;tate of vegeta|bles, which con&s;titutes what Linnaeus and other na|turali&s;ts have denominated <HI>Somnus Plantarum,</HI> or the <HI>&s;leep of plants.</HI> During the continuance of this <HI>vegeta|ble-&s;leep,</HI> the appearance of the plant is &s;o much chang|ed, that the mo&s;t experienced botani&s;t is &s;ometimes at a lo&s;s to know it, without a very minute examination. In &s;ome plants, the <HI>inviting &s;leeping point</HI> may be induced by robbing them of light for a time, but upon the re|turn of light, they re&s;ume their waking &s;tate. We may lay it down as a pretty con&s;tant and certain axiom, that the <HI>&s;leep of vegetables,</HI> is more or le&s;s profound in proportion to their vigour or debility.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Some of the&s;e hints on the <HI>irritability, voluntary</HI> and <HI>involuntary motions</HI> of vegetables, were &s;ugge&s;ted to me by Benjamin Smith Barton, M. D. Pro|fe&s;&s;or of Natural Hi&s;tory and Botany in the college of Philadelphia, &amp;c. &amp;c.</NOTE></P>

IF the vigour and debility depend upon the effects of &s;timuli acting on the <HI>irritability</HI> in vegetables: If the motions likewi&s;e depend upon, and are &s;ub&s;ervient to a "<HI>vegetable will;</HI>" and if &s;leep more or le&s;s profound, depends upon the application of &s;timuli, which, I think has been &s;ufficiently proven; would it be unphilo&s;o|phical to infer, that vegetables, in time of morbid &s;leep, are di&s;turbed with dreams peculiar to them&s;elves?</P>
<P>THE connection of cau&s;es and effects, traced in the vegetable world, and compared with tho&s;e of the animal kingdom, point out the &s;triking analogy between the two; and proclaim that Nature is uniformly the &s;ame in all her operations.</P>
<P>AN accurate knowledge of the effects of <HI>&s;leep,</HI> upon the human &s;y&s;tem, will enable us to &s;ee the propriety of fortifying the body, in the morning, with either the durable or diffu&s;ible &s;timuli, again&s;t the noxious quality of the air at certain &s;ea&s;ons of the year; it like|wi&s;e will further enable us, to point out the impropri|ety of the conjugal pair gratifying or indulging the hymeneal plea&s;ures in the morning. Thus, the tem|perature and purity of the air, food and drink, labour of body or of mind, the &s;timulus of light and &s;ound, <Q>the exerci&s;e of pa&s;&s;ion and emotion, when their &s;ti|mulus neither &s;tops &s;hort of the proper point, nor goes beyond it, all give a di&s;po&s;ition to &s;leep,</Q> of the mo&s;t &s;alutary kind.</P>
<P>BEFORE I conclude the &s;ubject of <HI>&s;leep,</HI> I beg leave to mention a few remarkable, important, and valu|able facts, concerning the <HI>Hybernation</HI> of animals, which will, beyond all &s;cruple, help to re&s;olve many phoeno|mena in nature, &s;hew the great &s;edative power of cold, and the effects it has in producing <HI>&s;leep,</HI> in many fami|lies of the animal kingdom. By the term <HI>Hybernation,</HI> is to be under&s;tood, that dormant &s;tate in which ani|mals of many different kinds, &s;ub&s;i&s;t in winter without
<PB N="15" REF="023290_0012_0FBEE60749CC8B80">
food, without any apparent motion, and without &s;en&s;e, &s;eemingly &s;ound <HI>a&s;leep,</HI> and not recoverable from it unle&s;s placed in a warmer atmo&s;phere. It is to be ob|&s;erved, that this faculty is confined to tho&s;e animals that are the inhabitants of the colder regions of the earth; at lea&s;t we know of no in&s;tance of <HI>Hybernation</HI> of ani|mals, which dwell in the intratropical parts of the earth. This &s;tate of torpidity is mo&s;t remarkable in the amphibious animals, &s;uch as the frogs, the toads, the lizards, and, I &s;u&s;pect, the &s;erpents. There are like|wi&s;e &s;everal quadrupeds, which are remarkable for re|maining during winter in a torpid &s;tate, &s;uch as the <HI>bear,</HI> the <HI>badger,</HI> the <HI>&s;quirrel,</HI> the <HI>hedge-hog,</HI> the <HI>dor|mou&s;e,</HI> the <HI>bat,</HI> &amp;c. The Count de Buffon, and &s;everal other naturali&s;ts, a&s;cribe this &s;tate to the coldne&s;s of <HI>their</HI> blood; but, according to Mr. John Hunter's ex|periments, it does not appear that the blood of the <HI>bear,</HI> of the <HI>hedge-hog,</HI> of the <HI>badger,</HI> or of the <HI>dor|mou&s;e,</HI> is a degree colder, than what we find to be in general the ca&s;e, in animals of the &s;ame cla&s;s. It has been found by experiments made by Mr. Hunter, that a frog receives and dige&s;ts food, when it is in an atmo&s;phere in which the thermometer &s;tands at 60&deg;. but that it does not dige&s;t food when the cold comes down to 40&deg;.

<P>FROM comparing the&s;e facts and experiments, and the fifth and &s;ixth experiments of William Hew&s;on's Inquiry into the properties of the blood, may we not venture to draw the following conclu&s;ions? 1&s;t. That cold is a great debilitating or &s;edative power: 2d. That if the blood of &s;ome of the hybernating animals be ac|tually at re&s;t for a con&s;iderable length of time, it may be rendered fluid by the gradual introduction of heat, and the animal re&s;tored to life. With the&s;e facts and ob|&s;ervations, I fini&s;h the &s;ubject of <HI>&s;leep,</HI> and now pro|ceed, in the <HI>&s;econd</HI> place, to the inquiry of <HI>Dreams.</HI></P>
<P>FROM the theory of <HI>&s;leep</HI> already given, I am enabled to pro&s;ecute with more propriety the &s;ubject of <HI>Dreams.</HI> It has been made to appear, that profound &s;leep de|pends upon cau&s;es producing a certain degree of ex|citement favourable to the point at which &s;leep com|mences, and that dreams are the effects of morbid <HI>&s;leep,</HI> which depend upon the &s;ame &s;timulus either &s;topping &s;hort of the proper point, or going beyond it. It is in this &s;tate of <HI>&s;leep,</HI> that the <HI>&s;oul</HI> does think (according to Mr. Locke), when the intellectual functions are par|tially &s;u&s;pended. Dreams may be explained, likewi&s;e, upon the &s;ame method of rea&s;oning, as <HI>&s;leep.</HI> Certain
<PB N="17" REF="023290_0014_0FBEE60A47594960">
powers do exert their effects on the principle of life, and produce an excitement unfavourable to refre&s;hing &s;leep, which will be &s;trictly attended to in the cour&s;e of this &s;ubject; and, I think, the old adage of philo&s;o|phers, will apply equally well here, as in many other ca&s;es, "that Nature does nothing in vain."</P>
<P>I PRESUME, from what has been advanced, it will obviou&s;ly appear, that a complete excitement of the brain, does nece&s;&s;arily take place in time of profound &s;leep, different from that excitement, which takes place, in order to the proper exerci&s;e of the intellectual func|tions in the waking &s;tate, and that, in time of morbid &s;leep, there is either a deficiency or an exce&s;s of ex|citement, with re&s;pect to the different functions, in different degrees. In &s;uch an intermediate &s;tate of de|ficiency or exce&s;s of excitement in the brain, there always occurs more or le&s;s of dreaming: <Q>There are, in this &s;tate, fal&s;e perceptions, fal&s;e a&s;&s;ociations, fal&s;e judgments, and di&s;proportionate emotions.</Q> In &s;hort, the circum&s;tances attending dreaming, are ob&s;erved to take place in delirium, only differing in degree.</P>
<P>IN &s;thenic and a&s;thenic di&s;ea&s;es, when attended with delirium, the excitement in the former is carried be|yond that point at which inviting &s;leep commences, and, in the latter, &s;tops &s;hort of it.</P>
<P>THUS, I conceive, it will evidently appear, that there are two kinds of delirium, depending upon dif|ferent degrees of excitement: the one is owing to an exce&s;&s;ive, and the other to a deficient, degree of excite|ment in the brain. Further, it may, perhaps, &s;erve to illu&s;trate the analogy between dreaming and delirium; and the latter is only a bridge for the former to travel over to <HI>In&s;ania,</HI> if I may be allowed the expre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>DREAMS affect tho&s;e mo&s;t, who are of a debilitated and delicate habit, and tho&s;e ea&s;ily affected by &s;light
<PB N="18" REF="023290_0015_0FBEE60F41B32288">
and trifling cau&s;es. A labouring man &s;eldom dreams much. <Q>The &s;leep of a labouring man in &s;weet, whe|ther he eats little or much, but the abundance of the rich will not &s;uffer him to &s;leep<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Eccle&s;ia&s;tes, chap. v. ver. 12.</NOTE></Q>. Be&s;ides the&s;e, there are &s;ome healthy per&s;ons who &s;eldom or never dream at all. Mr. Locke tells us, <Q>he once knew a man that was bred a &s;cholar, and had no bad me|mory, who told him, he had never dreamed in his life, till he had that fever he was then newly reco|vered of, which was about the five or &s;ix and twen|tieth year of his age.</Q> And, as a farther corroborat|ing circum&s;tance, I have been informed by a gentleman of my acquaintance, that Dr. William Pitt Smith, of New-York, was acquainted with a lady of that city, who, at the age of twenty-three years, declared, &s;he had never dreamed in her life, and further, that the idea of dreaming appeared &s;o ab&s;urd to her, that &s;he did not believe there were any &s;uch things as dreams.&mdash;I have no doubt, the world affords many more &s;uch in&s;tances.</P>
<P><Q>THE dreams of &s;leeping men are, as I take it, all made up of the waking man's ideas, though, for the mo&s;t part, oddly put together<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Locke on the Human Under&s;tanding, vol. i. pag. 76. &s;ect. 17.</NOTE></Q>. That this is not always the ca&s;e, may, I pre&s;ume, be proven upon Mr. Locke's own principles of rea&s;oning, that if all our ideas are derived from &s;en&s;ation and reflexion, which he endeavours to maintain, and if, in time of profound &s;leep, the <HI>&s;oul</HI> does not think, then dreaming mo&s;t un|que&s;tionably mu&s;t be, in time of morbid <HI>&s;leep,</HI> when the powers of the mind are only partially &s;u&s;pended; therefore, at that time, the organs of &s;en&s;e are excita|ble to new impre&s;&s;ions from cau&s;es &s;ugge&s;ted from without, and certainly they may beget new ideas with|in, and likewi&s;e excite tho&s;e into action already fixed in the mind, though, for the mo&s;t part, incoherent.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="023290_0016_0FBEE61109FF5F38">
It has been ob&s;erved, in the former part of this di&s;|&s;ertation, that the excitability is more abundant in the latter part of night, and towards morning, than in the fore part of the evening, con&s;equently more ea&s;ily af|fected by any &s;timuli, that may be at that time applied. This will, perhaps, enable us to explain more &s;atisfac|torily the phaenomenon of dreaming, at the approach of day, than at any period of the night; for it is ge|nerally remarked, that thieves make choice of what is vulgarly called the dead hour of the night, to make their depredations, when people are &s;uppo&s;ed to be fa&s;t locked in the arms of profound <HI>&s;leep.</HI></P>
<P>FURTHER, in &s;upport of this &s;ubject, I beg leave to adduce the following fact, from Dr. Beattie's <HI>Di&s;&s;erta|tions Moral and Critical.</HI> He ob&s;erves, that <Q>particular dreams might be accounted for from impre&s;&s;ions made in time of &s;leep on the organs of &s;en&s;e, parti|cularly tho&s;e of touch and feeling. A very &s;light hint, &s;ugge&s;ted from without, or in any way &s;ugge&s;t|ed, is &s;ufficient for fancy to work upon, in produc|ing multitudes of vi&s;ionary exhibitions. I have heard from good authority, of a gentleman in the army, who&s;e imagination was &s;o ea&s;ily affected in &s;leep with impre&s;&s;ions made on the outward &s;en&s;es, that his companions, by &s;peaking &s;oftly in his ear, could cau&s;e him to dream of what they plea&s;ed: once, in particular, they made him go through the whole procedure of a duel, from the beginning of the quar|rel to the firing of a pi&s;tol, which they put in his hand for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">hat purpo&s;e, and which, by the explo&s;ion, awaked him.</Q> I take the liberty of mentioning another fact, which will help to illu&s;trate the very point in que&s;tion. It is a fact I obtained of a gentle|man of my acquaintance, of exten&s;ive ob&s;ervation and unblemi&s;hed moral character, who related his dream in the following words. <Q>I imagined I &s;aw, at ten o'clock in the morning, a moon in the ea&s;t, &s;hoot from it&s;elf like one meteor from another, fall to the horizon,
<PB N="20" REF="023290_0017_0FBEE6128B059FF0">
and a&s;&s;ume the appearance of a ri&s;ing full moon. Upon the appearance of this &s;ingular phaenomenon, I thought my dog &s;tarted in pur&s;uit of it. Immedi|ately my imagination was changed to the we&s;t, where I fancied I &s;aw a per&s;on de&s;cending from heaven, in a flame of fire. When it came in contact with the earth, a very great &s;moke i&s;&s;ued, which &s;eemed to &s;pread far and wide. This was &s;oon di&s;&s;ipated, and I thought my companions &s;aid they ob&s;erved a man, who had de&s;cended in that flame of fire. They went off to meet him, and, behold, returned with a per&s;on dre&s;&s;ed in a &s;ailor's grab: I a&s;ked him from whence he came? he an&s;wered, he was taken up in a water &s;pout, in a river (where he was fi&s;hing for his living) about &s;ixty miles from this &s;pot; and he ob&s;erved fur|ther, that he &s;hould have de&s;cended much fa&s;ter, if it had not been for a large windla&s;s he had hold of in his pa&s;&s;age from above.</Q> A complete and judi|cious induction of the effects of the&s;e facts, are &s;uffi|cient to prove the a&s;toni&s;hing vivacity of the imagina|tion, the ab&s;urdity and incoherence of the ideas in time of dreaming, and that they are not always made up of the waking man's thoughts.</P>
<P>I SHALL, in the <HI>third</HI> place, proceed to animadvert upon the effects of dreams on the faculties of the mind.</P>
<P>DOES not the exce&s;&s;ive or deficient degree of excite|ment, con&s;tituting the morbid &s;tate of &s;leep, wherein certain faculties of the mind are awakened, &s;eem to argue in favour of the different powers of the mind oc|cupying different parts of &s;pace in the brain? If &s;o, it will help to re&s;olve the cau&s;es, why, &s;ometimes the imagination, the memory, and the judgment, are parti|ally excited, and &s;ometimes deranged and impaired in dreams, and in di&s;ea&s;es. There are numberle&s;s facts that may be adduced, in proof of the effects of di&s;ea&s;es and accidents, in de&s;troying, or impairing, the intel|lectual
<PB N="21" REF="023290_0018_0FBEE6140BA86000">
faculties. But, this is rather foreign to the pre&s;ent inquiry. I &s;hall, therefore, confine my&s;elf to the effects of dreams on the faculties of the mind.</P>
<P>"THE imagination, or fancy, &s;eems to be" one of all our mental powers, or faculties, the lea&s;t &s;u&s;pended in its operation by &s;leep. Of the other powers, or facul|ties, &s;ome are more, others le&s;s, affected, and &s;ome ap|pear to be, for a time, wholly &s;u&s;pended. That the memory is at times impaired or partially excited in &s;leep, may be proven from this, that a per&s;on will dream of tran&s;acting bu&s;ine&s;s with a decea&s;ed friend, without recollecting any thing of his death. The judgment is frequently impaired in dreams, as well as in di&s;ea&s;es, and the imagination retains its vigour in tolerable force. That there is &s;ometimes an a&s;&s;ociation of ideas in &s;leep, I pre&s;ume, will not be di&s;puted; and it may be made to appear from this, that, if I dream of the object of my affection, it tran&s;ports my imagination back to the place where &s;he mo&s;t commonly re&s;ides; but, for the mo&s;t part, the a&s;&s;ociation of ideas is fal&s;e and delu&s;ive, in our dreaming moments. Sometimes, the under&s;tand|ing is &s;o deranged, and has &s;o for&s;aken us, that we are entirely deprived of the power and freedom of the will. Hence, in dreams, we &s;eem to experience a fal&s;e nece&s;&s;ity of running into trouble, pain, and many other perplexi|ties, though, with a vigorous exertion of that power of the under&s;tanding, the <HI>will,</HI> we &s;hould find a remedy or an antidote to all &s;uch harra&s;&s;ing ideas.</P>
<P>BUT &s;leep has a wonderful power over all our facul|ties, be&s;ides tho&s;e mentioned above. Sometimes &s;uch a change takes place in the &s;tate of the brain, from the influence of certain powers, that we &s;eem to have en|tirely lo&s;t our moral faculty. Hence, we &s;ometimes dream of perpetrating crimes without &s;cruple or re|mor&s;e; crimes, both repugnant to law and to go&s;pel, and at which we &s;hould &s;hudder when awake. Would
<PB N="22" REF="023290_0019_0FBEE615E83A4378">
it be admitted, if I were to a&s;cribe this to the de&s;er|tion of the judgment?</P>
<P>AN attempt to explain all the dreams recorded in the Old and New Te&s;tament, upon the &s;ame phy&s;ical cau&s;es as we do tho&s;e of the pre&s;ent day, would, perhaps, &s;ugge&s;t a hint favourable to dei&s;tical principles, throw &s;ome objections in the way, and have a tendency to o|verturn, and retard the progre&s;s of, the Chri&s;tian reli|gion, with &s;ome weak and wavering minds. Far be it from me, however, that I &s;hould entertain, or even wi&s;h to &s;upport, an idea, &s;o unfriendly to the moral &s;cience, to the happine&s;s, and to the good order, of &s;ociety: For we are warranted by the &s;ame &s;acred hi&s;tory to be|lieve, <Q>that dreams have given information of future events,</Q> and that they were revealed to &s;ome per&s;ons, for certain purpo&s;es, by the Deity. Hence, weak and ignorant people infer, that they are &s;till prophetical, and ominous of <HI>their</HI> future events; but, what can be more ab&s;urd than &s;uch &s;uper&s;titious notions? <Q>Su|per&s;tition is one of the wor&s;t di&s;ea&s;es of the <HI>&s;oul.</HI> It is generally unfriendly to happine&s;s, to rational pie|ty, and to &s;ound philo&s;ophy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Dr. Beattie's Di&s;&s;ertations Moral and Critical.</NOTE></Q>. Then, <Q>as nature has done nothing in vain,</Q> may I not infer, that dreams are frequently of &s;ervice to &s;ome people? for, according to the Chevalier Ram&s;ay, the Deity in&s;titut|ted phy&s;ical evil for the eradication of moral evil. May not, then, bodily and mental pain, which are fre|quently experienced in dreams, be of u&s;e to tho&s;e per|&s;ons in the way of phy&s;ical admonition, and that they may be &s;erviceable as means of moral improvement? <Q>For we find that bodily and mental pains were the remedies, employed in the Old Te&s;tament, for extir|pating vice and promoting virtue<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See an Inquiry into the Influence of Phy&s;ical Cau&s;es upon the Moral Faculty, by Benjamin Ru&s;h, M.

<P>FIRST. I &s;hall con&s;ider tho&s;e external cau&s;es, which, if applied in exce&s;s, run the excitement beyond that point at which profound &s;leep commences.</P>
<P>THESE are &s;uch as exce&s;&s;ive bodily fatigue, too great heat accumulated in the room, either from the <HI>&s;un,</HI> fire, or bed-clothes, exce&s;&s;ive eating of rich and nouri&s;hing food, and too free u&s;e of fermented, or &s;pirituous, li|quors; too pure or dephlogi&s;ticated air; worms in the alimentary pa&s;&s;age; a <Q>great abundance and velocity of rich blood;</Q> an accumulation of urine in the

<P>THESE are &s;uch as idlene&s;s, cold, any way introduced, darkne&s;s, &s;ilence, too long ab&s;tinence either from eat|ing or drinking, or, rather, a deficiency of the &s;timu|lant effects of the&s;e powers; an unea&s;y po&s;ition of the body in time of &s;leep; tumors &s;ituated externally on, or in the neighbourhood of, the trachea; ligatures on any part of the body; air rendered very impure, from its being impregnated with any noxious particles; ob|&s;tructed nares, either from mucous, or polypi, or any other &s;ub&s;tance impacted in, and &s;hutting up, their pa&s;|&s;age; a penury of blood, and an exce&s;&s;ive evacuation of any kind.</P>
