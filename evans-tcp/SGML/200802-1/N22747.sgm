<P>_THIS valuable fragment from the rec|ords of ancient wi&s;dom, comprehends this u&s;eful truth, that from experience are all our &s;afe conclu&s;ions, re&s;pecting the character of &s;ociety, and the hap|pine&s;s to be attained in it. The re&s;olution formed upon this maxim, has been more celebrated, than the maxim it&s;elf. It is experience which recommends moderation in our de&s;ires, and in our expectations, but facts, in all ages, are more ea&s;ily communicated by words, than the maxims, which ju&s;tify the conclu|&s;ions of our highe&s;t wi&s;dom. The writer affirms, that independent of every advantage from genius and edu|cation,
<PB N="6" REF="030058_0004_0FE41C4B83065E48">
this truth of our text is e&s;tabli&s;hed. The whole paragraph contains an appeal<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There is a different preface in the Vulgate.</NOTE> of a man to his neighbours, or an inquiry which may be thus repre|&s;ented. Indeed, &s;hould I have no uncommon natural powers; or &s;hould I not have cultivated my under|&s;tanding; &s;hould I not have been a man of deep re|flection, or &s;hould I not have the &s;ecrets of in&s;pira|tion; tell me, whence could I get wi&s;dom? Am I fir&s;t to comprehend all creation? Who hath done this? Who hath a&s;cended into heaven, or who hath de&s;cended? Who hath gathered the winds in his hand, or confined the waters in his garment? Who hath e&s;tabli&s;hed all parts of the earth? What is the name of this man, or what is his &s;on's name? Can any man tell? Is not every truth of God approved, when it has been &s;afe to tho&s;e who tru&s;t in it? Add thou not then ra&s;hly to his words; affirm only from experi|ence; le&s;t thy folly be expo&s;ed, and thou lead other men into errour. He then proceeds to his conclu&s;ion. He had con&s;idered affluence, and poverty, and had devoutly ob&s;erved how far they contribute u&s;ually to happine&s;s, and he tells us, that experience and ob&s;er|vation had reconciled his mind to the nature of hu|man life, and had taught him to acquie&s;ce in tho&s;e moderate de&s;ires, which are much more adapted to health, and contentment, and have their objects com|monly within every man's reach. Experience has continued to decide in favour of this choice, and to render it happy. Our text then a&s;&s;ures us that the laws of God are known from experience, and from the &s;afety and happine&s;s men find in them; that every advantage beyond pa&s;t experience, &s;hould be pur&s;ued with the greate&s;t caution; that attempts at higher
<PB N="7" REF="030058_0005_0FE41C1CE5F63F18">
happine&s;s have been made with frequent di&s;appoint|ments; that reformations have been urged, but not accompli&s;hed; and that the many di&s;appointments &s;hould be le&s;&s;ons of the highe&s;t wi&s;dom to mankind.</P>
<P>This &s;entiment accommodates it&s;elf to the pre&s;ent &s;olemnities. The horrours of war are to be depre|cated. Benevolence teaches us to avoid them; &s;ound policy to prevent them by all rea&s;onable mea&s;ures; and religion to abhor the occa&s;ions of them. But the world is not in our power. Pa&s;&s;ions exi&s;t every where, beyond control from principles within, and from fears without. General happine&s;s is the be&s;t object of po|litical economy, and &s;hould be regarded in all laws and in every community. But it is not what exi&s;ts, but what is to be pur&s;ued. It is to the mind, an a&s;&s;em|blage of all tho&s;e ble&s;&s;ings, which have been reported among men, but which have never exi&s;ted together, or in perfection. The picture is bold. It may fill the mind, and in&s;pire &s;ublime hopes. But &s;teadily viewed, and without fair compari&s;on with nature, it may di&s;|tract the imagination, make men forget the propor|tions of nature, and leave them di&s;&s;atisfied with the real objects before them, and with that happine&s;s, which is their be&s;t, becau&s;e their highe&s;t attainment. But even this happine&s;s is unequal in different nations, and in different ages. Its progre&s;s in &s;ociety re&s;em|bles the progre&s;s of all our knowledge from experi|ence. It is gained by &s;low degrees and calm inquiry, and it is accompanied with unavoidable prejudices. Nations like men have a re&s;emblance in their general character, but their manners may be di&s;tinct. The re|e&s;tabli&s;hment of any police has been found to be im|practicable, becau&s;e the habits, which formed it, are
<PB N="8" REF="030058_0006_0FE41C2836FB68B0">
unattainable. Nations may profit by the re&s;emblance, becau&s;e they knew from it the object of government and the character of mankind. But no hopes from experience will ri&s;e above the condition of human nature. From the wi&s;dom of preceding ages,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Spencer.</NOTE> Mo&s;es &s;upplied the principles of his government, and the le&s;&s;ons of morality which accompany his laws. He did not in&s;titute wars, but he found them in the order of our world. He did not rea&s;on about their nature, but their coincidence with his political hopes. The polit|ical exi&s;tence of his nation began, when they were in arms. The principles upon which they were taken at fir&s;t, were never unnece&s;&s;ary, nor was their influence upon the national character ever lo&s;t. They reduced moral life below the &s;tandard of an happy government, but the people had not the &s;pirit of &s;uch a government. There are in times of peace, in&s;titutions of as active virtue, and of as high &s;pirit of honour, as can exi&s;t in war. There may exi&s;t a generous emulation in the arts, and of civil honours, which may command all the re&s;ources of human genius. And there are the en|dearing manners of dome&s;tic life to &s;weeten the tem|per, and to conciliate the affections. It was not, be|cau&s;e upon fair compari&s;on, war could be preferred, but becau&s;e war was more congenial with the preva|lent character of mankind. The &s;pirit of war &s;peaks in the devotion of David. But his &s;ublime thoughts could not in&s;pire tho&s;e emotions, which compo&s;e the de&s;cription of wi&s;dom by his &s;ucce&s;&s;our. It was in the quiet of a peaceful e&s;tabli&s;hment, that the age became enlightened, as well as great. But in our world, we have not been able to provide the events, which com|bine
<PB N="9" REF="030058_0007_0FE41C52AE25F318">
empires, and pre&s;erve their exi&s;tence, otherwi&s;e than by the active and contending pa&s;&s;ions of man|kind. The&s;e events have not only given being to all great nations, but they have aided the triumph of every religious e&s;tabli&s;hment. Even religious wars have ever been wor&s;e than tho&s;e of princes for civil cau&s;es, or political fame, becau&s;e they have more pa&s;&s;ion, and it is determined from the origin and nature of the e&s;tab|li&s;hments, con&s;equent upon them, that they cannot be the foundation for the hopes of a perpetual peace. The difference of motives profe&s;&s;ed in them, has made no difference in the enormities, they have occa&s;ioned. It then remains a que&s;tion, &s;ince &s;uch a &s;tate of the pa&s;&s;ions has ever exi&s;ted, as is a &s;elf-exciting cau&s;e of war, and therefore as its incentives cannot fail from the pre&s;ent con&s;titution of the human mind, whether a &s;tate of con&s;tant preparation, be not the only &s;tate of &s;afety, to nations, and to mankind.</P>
<P>To examine a &s;ubject of this intere&s;ting nature, we mu&s;t not propo&s;e a favourite theory of the pa&s;&s;ions, but &s;ome example of the mo&s;t happy conduct of them. If we cannot find a &s;ucce&s;sful experiment, we &s;hould produce the be&s;t effects in circum&s;tances, mo&s;t indul|gent to our hopes. We &s;hould examine the minds of men, when mo&s;t detached from the political views of their age, &s;imple in their manners, elevated beyond the love of fame, or wealth, and in their maxims pure, peaceable, and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive. Too humble to hope for preferment in the &s;tate, and too devout to refu&s;e the mo&s;t &s;evere re&s;traints upon their pa&s;&s;ions. From the conduct of &s;uch men, we may judge of the influence of condition, of the progre&s;s of &s;ociety, of the motives of pro&s;perity, and of the nature of a religious or civil
<PB N="10" REF="030058_0008_0FE41C548B191850">
e&s;tabli&s;hment. And our conclu&s;ions from &s;uch an ex|ample, may be as &s;afe, as the nature of human knowl|edge will admit.</P>
<P>And what hi&s;tory can be better adapted to a Chri&s;|tian a&s;&s;embly, than the hi&s;tory of their own religion? Chri&s;tians being in civil &s;ociety, did not refu&s;e obedi|ence to the laws. The right of war was not denied, or maintained. The manners they a&s;&s;ociated with their religious profe&s;&s;ion, were governed by the love of peace. From the ab&s;ence of power, and the full &s;trength of mutual dependence, their habits were more &s;ocial and more pure. The mo&s;t offen&s;ive part of their lives was obliged by per&s;ecution, and their unkind opinions of mankind; but this a&s;&s;i&s;ted them in their re&s;i&s;tance to the habits of civil &s;ociety, and for a long time pre&s;erved them from the compliances, which gradually obtained from pretended regard to conveni|ence and to duty, and the &s;uppo&s;ed obligations of dif|ferent circum&s;tances, but really from the a&s;&s;imilation of their manners and character to that of human na|ture, and the order of our world. This expediency was di&s;clo&s;ed in a letter, or in &s;ome guarded expre&s;&s;ion; was betrayed in confidence, and employed with fear; was adopted with caution, and confe&s;&s;ed with diffi|dence; was oppo&s;ed by re&s;traints and qualifications; before it was e&s;tabli&s;hed in belief, boa&s;ted of as ju&s;t, and maintained by violence. Chri&s;tians, after long depre&s;&s;ion, voluntary mortifications, and arbitrary rules upon the pa&s;&s;ions, and even under the belief of a &s;peedy and a miraculous change of condition in our world, at la&s;t claimed and exerci&s;ed all the rights of war. They borrowed in their earlie&s;t pro&s;perity from every in&s;titution, which could unite with the preju|dices
<PB N="11" REF="030058_0009_0FE41C5687E90640">
of their converts. We look not then at their primitive morals, but at the character of man: not at profe&s;&s;ions, but at actions. Mahomed adopted war, but the Chri&s;tians had practi&s;ed it. Chri&s;tians yielded to its expediency, but Mahomedans profiting by ex|perience, entered upon the world in triumph.</P>
<P>To trace this hi&s;tory may not be without in&s;truc|tion. The Author of our religion has reported by his di&s;ciples, his own convictions of the right of war. Je&s;us di&s;covered to his friends, before his entrance upon the garden, in which he was apprehended, that he was determined to re&s;i&s;t. But the prudence of a di&s;ciple could not be as ea&s;ily under the command of his ma&s;ter, as his zeal. The reproof a&s;&s;ures him, that his re&s;i&s;tance was un&s;ea&s;onable, not unlawful; becau&s;e he went armed by his authority, and with his knowl|edge. His followers were thus taught to employ pru|dence with the lawfulne&s;s of war: And as the de&s;truc|tion of the country was impending, they were not taught to contend in its battles. This ingenuous tem|per was not lo&s;t in the primitive ages. To our own times, the records of men, who were governed by their religion, rather than education, have been carefully tran&s;mitted. A work attributed to one<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Clement.</NOTE> of the fir&s;t Chri&s;tians, di&s;&s;uades from &s;edition and &s;chi&s;m, from moral motives, rather than from expre&s;s and religious prohibition. And from military arrangements, he happily illu&s;trates the common intere&s;t, which com|prehends what is u&s;eful to the &s;trength and defence of their cau&s;e. A care for per&s;onal &s;afety induces an|other<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ignatius.</NOTE> to advi&s;e to appea&s;e the people, from a knowl|edge of their pa&s;&s;ions, which precipitate human af|fairs.
<PB N="12" REF="030058_0010_0FE41C5BB5385808">
While a third<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Polycarp.</NOTE> qualifies his obedience to civil authority by the protection, he receives; and from the indignation which ri&s;es again&s;t in&s;ult and oppre&s;&s;ion, he claims the right to que&s;tion their power, who do public wrongs. The character and the ju&s;tice of the&s;e feelings, in our free government, it is not nece&s;&s;ary to vindicate, or de&s;cribe. They belong to the be&s;t part of human nature.</P>
<P>In the next period we &s;ee le&s;s &s;implicity of heart, and le&s;s ingenuous &s;entiments. When Chri&s;tianity had a public form, and a ri&s;ing intere&s;t, it &s;peaks in flattering apologies, from its more learned friends, the language of the laws, and the &s;ubordination of the empire. Thus while one<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Athenagoras.</NOTE> acquie&s;ces in the laws of &s;lavery, and the full authority of rea&s;on, and govern|ment in the concerns of life, another<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ju&s;tin.</NOTE> to quiet the &s;tate, a&s;cribes fal&s;e honours to his religion, and pro|fe&s;&s;es to prefer prayers to arms, and in the apparent piety, though errour of his addre&s;s, he oppo&s;es active duty to devotion, and the order of civil &s;ociety, to the hopes of a divine religion. While a third,<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Irenaeus.</NOTE> more &s;in|cere, than di&s;cerning, dares to anticipate a triumph over the laws of nature, from an authority not e&s;tab|li&s;hed in the&s;e laws, but formed in a religion too pure to exi&s;t in the pre&s;ent order of our world. But the patrons of the Chri&s;tian cau&s;e, were not all of this character. They had refined their ta&s;te by the ele|gance of Rome, and had imbibed the manners of &s;oci|ety with the be&s;t knowledge of its laws. They were not &s;o ignorant as to plead for war from virtue, or re|ligion, nor &s;o &s;uper&s;titious, as to &s;ubvert &s;ociety, by refu&s;ing it the nece&s;&s;ary defence. To the pa&s;&s;ions of
<PB N="13" REF="030058_0011_0FE41C5DA6726840">
life, and to the habits of civil &s;ociety, they imputed the convul&s;ions of empires, and the defence of the &s;word. To meliorate human condition, it was taught,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lactantius.</NOTE> that the pa&s;&s;ions mu&s;t be governed. That from their nat|ural character, human genius was di&s;played in the arts of military defence, as well as in the maxims of virtue. The di&s;putes of the age<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Tertullian.</NOTE> for power, and the vile &s;ervices of faction were &s;tigmatized, as unlawful to Chri&s;tians from a regard to reputation and the public peace, while Roman eloquence in the &s;chool of Chri&s;t, taught the philo&s;ophy of rea&s;on and religion. "Nor do I refu&s;e," &s;ays an enlightened Chri&s;tian,<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Minutius Felix.</NOTE> "to confe&s;s, that it is the duty of man to know him&s;elf in all the relations of his being. What he is, whence he is, and why he exi&s;ts. This duty he cannot perform, without an in|quiry into all things around him, for they are &s;o a&s;&s;o|ciated, connected, and united, that an ignorance of them involves an ignorance of him&s;elf, and di&s;quali|fies him for every civil obligation. Where is &s;ociety formed on virtue," he appeals, "or di&s;&s;olved without blood? Wars throughout the world, di&s;unite the deare&s;t kindred, and the greate&s;t empires report not the &s;ame hi&s;tory of their fate!"</P>
<P>A cau&s;e, which could admit &s;uch rational views of &s;ociety, mu&s;t have already ri&s;en into reputation, and its friends mu&s;t have had an acquaintance with the world. We may then &s;oon expect to find its power and its influence employed in public affairs. When Chri&s;ti|anity had thus prevailed, its friends had intere&s;t at court, and in the armies. It had a command among parties in the &s;tate. Experience has told us, what to expect. Let us hear, how the Fathers rea&s;on, what
<PB N="14" REF="030058_0012_0FE41C5F53378A58">
the councils publi&s;h, and the civil laws ordain. Let us li&s;ten to Chry&s;o&s;tom, who exalted the glory of a Chri&s;tian prince, and to a Gregory who pleaded with bold imagination and genius again&s;t an apo&s;tate. We may find perpetuated the pro&s;perity of an e&s;tabli&s;h|ment, by all the means of civil power, till a Bernard di&s;plays to us the full force of pro&s;perity upon a long continued &s;uper&s;tition, which had e&s;tabli&s;hed it&s;elf up|on the pure&s;t religion ever profe&s;&s;ed among men. We behold at length a war which armed Europe, and was the bolde&s;t effort of pa&s;&s;ion in religion. Conque&s;t was authori&s;ed in the cau&s;e of religion, and the power of war, the conduct of armies, and the control of the civil government were &s;urrendered to its claims.</P>
<P>At fir&s;t, to engage Chri&s;tians in war, the cro&s;s was di&s;played in their banners. This was not &s;o great a &s;truggle with former prejudices as we might imagine. No &s;ect had prevailed, which had been under the im|putation of making war unlawful. All reports leave rea&s;onable fears of mi&s;con&s;truction upon their opinion. The my&s;tic &s;ects in their infancy might favour or in|cline to it. Chri&s;tians &s;ought, at an early period, promotion to civil and military honours, and gradu|ally acquired their influence in the empire. Even the dignities in the church did not extingui&s;h all claims, or prove &s;ufficient to gratify their ambition, and the exce&s;s of panegyric, was the reward of the civil Fa|thers for di&s;tinctions, which they readily be&s;towed. A canon early impo&s;ed a re&s;traint upon this ambition. From the mode&s;t vindication of &s;elf defence in former apologies, the eloquence of Chry&s;o&s;tom proceeds to compare the mind under its pa&s;&s;ions, to a body in a fever, in which &s;afety directs the remedy. To a Chri&s;|tian
<PB N="15" REF="030058_0013_0FE41C61553AEFC0">
teacher he not only in&s;inuates, but recommends an addre&s;s devoid of Chri&s;tian &s;implicity. The power of princes was an emblem of &s;piritual dominion, too flat|tering not to be indulged. The Chri&s;tians had fought too many battles, and with too great &s;ucce&s;s, to doubt of the divine right of power, or the lawfulne&s;s of war. And, though Chri&s;tian teachers were profe&s;&s;ed friends of peace, they had profited enough from affairs of &s;tate, to know what the Bi&s;hop a&s;&s;ured them was true, that excellence in political knowledge was a commend|able qualification. An emperour aver&s;e from the pow|er and name of a Chri&s;tian &s;oon found the reluctance with which honours were abandoned. Panegyric was converted into the mo&s;t bitter invective. The prai&s;es of Con&s;tantine from Chry&s;o&s;tom may be oppo&s;ed to the talents of Gregory again&s;t Julian. Whatever could irritate by compari&s;on, or be hateful in its mo|tives, or injurious to reputation was pronounced with|out re&s;erve. A &s;pirit &s;o freely encouraged in the pri|mates of any order, cannot be re&s;trained by any in&s;ti|tutions. Neither the habit of a reclu&s;e, nor his vows will confine his ambition. The pride of opinion is not ob&s;tinate again&s;t the temptations of power. Ene|mies are more ea&s;ily &s;ilenced by authority, than argu|ment. The great Augu&s;tin encouraged the temper. In defiance of his fir&s;t maxims, he pa&s;&s;ed from a vin|dication of war, to the command of God in it. He pronounced that the general, or the &s;oldier were not &s;o much authors of war, as the mini&s;ters of God, and that they might exult, Ble&s;&s;ed be the Lord, who teach|eth our hands to war, and our fingers to fight.</P>
<P>Thus at la&s;t orders e&s;tabli&s;hed to exhibit the virtues of retirement and &s;ilence, became powerful a&s;&s;ociations
<PB N="16" REF="030058_0014_0FE41C29E0087C38">
in the church, and were transformed into &s;tanding armies, to in&s;tigate re&s;entment, and to interfere in the political concerns of princes. When the church be|came e&s;tabli&s;hed, there were few fears entertained up|on the &s;ubject of war, among the ruling eccle&s;ia&s;tics. The former doubts aro&s;e in private condition, in hum|ble &s;ects, and in times of per&s;ecution, but they di&s;ap|peared among even good men, when they were ac|quainted with the nece&s;&s;ity impo&s;ed upon our world, whatever peaceful di&s;po&s;itions they wi&s;hed to cultivate in it. They found it vain to &s;truggle again&s;t the order of events, and that their prudence and their &s;trength con&s;i&s;ted in that con&s;tant preparation, which could render them formidable to their enemies. The &s;ame exten&s;ive views of life, which exalt the hopes of virtue, obliged tho&s;e guards again&s;t the pa&s;&s;ions, which appear as clearly in the laws, the polity and education of every country, as they do in their military arrange|ments.</P>
<P>We may then con&s;ider the experiment upon the Chri&s;tian world as fairly made, and believe that no means have been found, to render its true princi|ples &s;o general and active, as to render our prepara|tions for war unnece&s;&s;ary. And no &s;ucce&s;s will ju&s;ti|fy our expectations of univer&s;al peace till public order, is public &s;entiment, rather than law, which at pre&s;ent appears to be a period, as remote from this, as any former age. Nor is the Chri&s;tian a &s;olitary experi|ment. The military is the be&s;t defined part of the in|&s;titution of Mo&s;es. The eque&s;trian order of Rome is better under&s;tood than the Senate; and the abu&s;e of the military power, is the mo&s;t notorious errour of the

And the in&s;titution we hon|our this day, reminds us of a more early military a&s;&s;ociation. And &s;uch parts of our excellent federal con&s;titution have proved to be the mo&s;t &s;ound, which have wi&s;ely regarded principles, it was obliged to admit and indulge, more from the wi&s;dom and ex|perience of nations, than from our own immediate preference or choice.</P>
<P>But le&s;t we &s;hould di&s;tru&s;t the zeal of ancient times, and pre&s;ume upon modern wi&s;dom, we have before us in our own country, the mo&s;t bold experiment, ever made in favour of perpetual peace, and it was con|ducted upon the Chri&s;tian motives of piety and be|nevolence.</P>
<P>A &s;ect e&s;tabli&s;hed upon the lovely plea, that it was practicable to live without war, originated a &s;tate of civil &s;ociety in a new country. The power of the magi&s;trate, it did admit, and did attempt to define. Says the mo&s;t able apologi&s;t<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Barclay.</NOTE> of the &s;ect, "Let it be admitted that the magi&s;trate may lawfully u&s;e his au|thority to pre&s;erve moral and perpetual &s;tatutes." He then pre&s;umes that every thing is granted, which ought to be required. But if laws may require the virtues of obedience, they mu&s;t defend the obedient. And the means of defence mu&s;t be as exten&s;ive as the evils of oppo&s;ition. The means mu&s;t be adequate. But in what does any penalty differ e&s;&s;entially from a war? To find the point at which men may de&s;i&s;t, &s;hort of the extent of their power, is difficult. If the
<PB N="18" REF="030058_0016_0FE41C2BE1CFF5C8">
individual may be defended, the &s;tate mu&s;t be, which unites its &s;afety with the multitude of the people. Civil &s;ociety involves then the right of war. But when we ob&s;erve the expedients to promote this fal&s;e &s;ecurity of &s;ociety; when we &s;ee its abject depend|ence; when we behold the character of intere&s;t in it; the limited power, or rather equivocal nature of its government, depending on private manners; the &s;u|periour &s;trength of private will; the di&s;couragement of knowledge to pre&s;erve it, the dangers of ambition; and the reluctant acquie&s;cence in this &s;tate, the &s;or|did intere&s;ts it creates in multiplied private views, and when we add an impartial<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Smith's Letters on Penn&s;ylvania.</NOTE> view of facts, which are of the greate&s;t con&s;equence, the experiment appears con|trary to nature, to civil government, and to per&s;onal &s;afety.</P>
<P>But while we confe&s;s the nece&s;&s;ity of war, and of a &s;tate of defence, we ought to be cautious not to pro|po&s;e too freely political advantages from war, or to encourage a di&s;po&s;ition to provoke it, without a &s;acred regard to all the motives of an honourable peace. There is an ambition, which may be awakened in great revolutions, but it &s;hould have urgent and noble occa&s;ions. Dangers may provoke ra&s;hne&s;s, rather than courage. Wars are ea&s;ily converted into real evils. Conque&s;ts have been faithfully reported, and hi&s;tory dwells upon them, but ambition for war has been often fatal. If wars can rai&s;e the fame of na|tions, they can as powerfully concur with the means of their de&s;truction. The con&s;equences of the Pelo|ponne&s;ian war upon the Grecian &s;tates, have been con|fe&s;&s;ed, and deplored. The &s;tate in which Grecian arts flouri&s;hed, was of peace.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="030058_0017_0FE41C6BEDAE36C0">The ambition of Rome under a military government employed a rival&s;hip, which had glory, but not victo|ry, and &s;hews how powerfully the &s;elf in&s;piration of liberty unites with excellence in the arts beyond the love of the arts, when aided only by power. A more generous emulation and friend&s;hip of the arts in Eu|rope prevented the recurrence of the &s;ame events. Independent nations produced a principle more active than any motives of government, and genius employ|ed the mo&s;t &s;plendid advantages, and was triumphant. And we ought on this occa&s;ion, to pay a ju&s;t tribute of re&s;pect to that patriot,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">JOHN ADAMS.</NOTE> who ju&s;tly holds a di&s;tin|gui&s;hed office in our federal government, for that &s;ea|&s;onable work, in which he has placed before us, the political experience of our world. Could the highe&s;t wi&s;dom have cho&s;en a &s;ubject, could it have cho&s;en a better for the in&s;truction and glory of our country? It affords a review of the difficulties of civil govern|ment, and of the endle&s;s expedients to maintain the pro&s;perity of &s;tates. Convinced of the nature of war, men in all ages, have imagined, that they could act up|on their &s;ober convictions: They have attempted to in|&s;titute an higher order of things, and to create an in|fluence of opinion over the pa&s;&s;ions of the world.</P>
<P>But they who con&s;ider the pre&s;ent &s;tate of our world, and our con&s;tant experience in it, may find the nece&s;&s;ity of that &s;ublime religion, which in&s;tructs our prudence in this world, but e&s;tabli&s;hes our be&s;t hopes upon our qualifications for a better life, and they may increa&s;e their e&s;teem of that revelation upon which all our hopes of happine&s;s mu&s;t re&s;t. Our highe&s;t duty is to guard again&s;t impending evils, while we endeav|our

our to pre&s;erve from a love of the public happine&s;s, for our own times, the &s;weet intervals of peace, in tho wi&s;dom of our laws, and in our con&s;tant preparation for a mo&s;t active defence.</P>
<P>To correct the vanity of our expectations from the greater wi&s;dom to prevail in our world from any cau&s;es, which now exi&s;t in it, let us only recollect the cau&s;es, which have already proved in&s;ufficient to e&s;tab|li&s;h a more happy order of things. Genius has in every country had its opportunities, to a&s;&s;i&s;t a flouri&s;h|ing age, and to plead with mankind, in favour of the ble&s;&s;ings of peace. When princes have contributed to the lovely purpo&s;e, the public &s;entiment of joy has been addre&s;&s;ed to them in the bolde&s;t panegyric. But the ambition of &s;tate&s;men, the corrupt manners, and turbulent pa&s;&s;ions of men have interrupted and fru&s;|trated every generous de&s;ign to e&s;tabli&s;h, what men have profe&s;&s;ed to believe to be the dignity of life and the end of government. Religion al&s;o has given its friendly a&s;&s;i&s;tance. But violence has been nur&s;ed even at the altars, and they who for one age a&s;&s;ociated religion with peace, have re&s;igned it to tho&s;e, who have made it the incentive of war. The human fac|ulties continue to develop unequally. Ambition is not le&s;s &s;trong, as the advantages of education are ex|tended. Natural and untutored pa&s;&s;ions with all their incentives, every where exi&s;t. War has yet all its cau&s;es. The pa&s;&s;ions which excite it, it can inflame. Little durable happine&s;s then can we hope from the enthu&s;ia&s;m of mankind in the mo&s;t ardent love of lib|erty. They feel their native claims on liberty, but command not for a long time, the wi&s;dom to pre&s;erve

it. In the means of bold re&s;i&s;tance nations become formidable, and re&s;train their enemies.</P>
<P>With &s;incerity then, we congratulate the Members of this ANCIENT AND HONOURABLE ARTIL|LERY COMPANY a&s;&s;embled this day, in the &s;pirit of our ance&s;tors, who were urged by a love of liberty and religion to e&s;tabli&s;h them&s;elves in the&s;e remote, and uncultivated regions. The rigour of their man|ners formed by per&s;ecution, and confirmed by habits of &s;uffering, and danger, did not in&s;truct them, with an ingenious modern,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Soame Jenyns.</NOTE> that the hi&s;tory of the Jews was not an example to them, or that local manners were the true principles of Chri&s;tian morality. They conceived that their future hopes did not refu&s;e them the be&s;t means to &s;ecure their pre&s;ent &s;afety, and they a&s;&s;ociated the u&s;e of arms, with their pure&s;t doctrines. Like Mo&s;es, they &s;upplied laws from experience, and like the great teacher of their religion, they provided principles of active virtue in the mo&s;t humble condi|tion. In this in&s;titution and &s;chool of arms, we re|cover the hi&s;tory of their be&s;t families, as well as prin|ciples, and the names of the officers lead us to the recollection of men, who have been con&s;picuous in the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive generations from the plantation of the colo|ny, to the pre&s;ent flouri&s;hing &s;tate of our common|wealth. It tran&s;mits the character and the &s;entiments of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts. As a very early in&s;titution it de|mands our veneration. In its freedom from innova|tion it is a memorial of the &s;tability of the public opinion regarding the u&s;e of arms; and even with its interruptions, it records its intimate connexion with the liberties of the people. During the la&s;t efforts

of the Hou&s;e of Stuarts to perpetuate their power, it cea&s;ed to enjoy its privileges, and in our late war with the parent country, it gave place to the e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of an army. Its members &s;aw at the&s;e memora|ble periods, the bolde&s;t attempts for freedom. In the fir&s;t, the &s;pirit of revolution was directed by an ambi|tion devoid of principle, and by an enthu&s;ia&s;m which could command, but not enjoy victory. Its &s;trength proved the terrour of a government, it was not able to reform, and fear qualified a power, which was not ab&s;olutely withdrawn. But in the other we beheld, the mild virtues in&s;pired by the love of liberty and mankind, and guarded by prudence and fortitude, conducted to victory by the laws of a free people. Our General became immortal, and our cau&s;e yet tri|umphs in the federal con&s;titution, and in the peace and pro&s;perity of our country. Thus have the ab&s;ent years of the hi&s;tory of this in&s;titution been &s;upplied from the records of our nation, as &s;acred to courage, and to a glorious defence of arms in the hands of a free people. Its pre&s;ent worthy members, and officers<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Q. M. Gen. AMASA DAVIS, Commander of the Company. J. EATON, Lieutenant. JER. KAHLER, En&s;ign.</NOTE> its active patriots, and the commanders of our late army perpetuate its &s;ame. The names of a HULL, a BROOKS, and a LINCOLN will be reverenced in future ages. May our national defence be as perfect, as it is nece&s;&s;ary, and ju&s;t.</P>
<P>But mankind are yet in a &s;tate of war. How terri|ble has been the havoc among the mo&s;t enlightened nations of Europe! We confe&s;s the melancholy truth. And we will not fall a willing &s;acrifice to the pa&s;&s;ions of angry nations. We love peace, but we will render

it &s;afe and honourable. We de&s;ire to po&s;&s;e&s;s the be&s;t ble&s;&s;ings of civil government, but we will be able to defend it. To re&s;train the pa&s;&s;ions of men, we mu&s;t be a terrour to them. We will love peace, but we will defy ambition, hate oppre&s;&s;ion, and die for our laws and our liberty. Pure religion will teach us to love peace, and experience will teach us, how to pre|&s;erve it. But we will never forget that the good citi|zen is a good &s;oldier. Able to defend, as well as &s;ure to de&s;erve his liberty. He hates faction, but he is not afraid of war in defence of his country. He loves peace, becau&s;e it pre&s;erves the highe&s;t value of freedom. He ri&s;es to conquer perver&s;e pa&s;&s;ions, not to employ them in his own cau&s;e. He appears to &s;up|port the laws, not to triumph over them. His victory is for good government, and to God, with a pure con&s;cience, he can commit his cau&s;e.</P>
