<HEAD>The <HI>INTRODUCTION.</HI></HEAD>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING the mo&s;t <HI>vile Per&s;onal Abu&s;es,</HI> and unprecedented Calum|nies lately &s;pewed out, it was re&s;olved, to drop the Affair, that Contention might cea&s;e, and leave the <HI>habitual Scriblers</HI> Ma&s;ters of the Field of Scandal, they having already (after little or no Oppo&s;ition) given up their Titles to correct Stile, Ju&s;t|ne&s;s of Thought, and Force of Argument. But finding them &s;till oppo&s;ing the Endeavours u&s;ed to caution the Town and Country again&s;t their ra&s;h and thoughtle&s;s Procedure in a <HI>medical Experiment</HI> of Con&s;equence, they continuing on their <HI>bare Word only,</HI> to affirm it well vouched, prudently managed, of uninterrupted Succe&s;s, and that the Mini&s;ters Preten&s;ions to Phy&s;ick is as good as that of the able&s;t Practitioners in the Land: To pre|vent the Publick here and el&s;ewhere being thus impo|&s;ed upon, and to maintain the Practitioners in their <HI>Rights and Priviledges,</HI> again&s;t the Inva&s;ion of &s;ome vain &s;elf-conceited Men, is the De&s;ign of the following Pages.</P>
<P>The weak Artifice they u&s;e to drown all Argument from the other Side, is the Clamour of <HI>Enemies to the Mini&s;try of this Country,</HI> tho' the&s;e Men they princi|pally aim at are well known to be their <HI>constant Hear|ers,</HI> and <HI>generous Contributors</HI> towards their Support. If a Stranger to the Affair were to read their Writings, he could not think otherways than that all the Mini&s;ters of <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> are Inoculators, all at Variance with the Practitioners in Phy&s;ick, in &s;hort, that they all are guil|ty of tho&s;e Things alledg'd again&s;t a few. To vindicate the Mini&s;try of <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> from the&s;e In&s;inuations; all the Town knows, that &s;everal of them have declared again&s;t Inoculation till further Light in the Practice, and many of them do not in the lea&s;t meddle; we have here among our Mini&s;ters <HI>Viros Eruditione, Probitate e&s;t Rerum u&s;te Spectabiles</HI>; that is, not only inoffen&s;ive in their Life and Conver&s;ation, but al&s;o of &s;hining active Virtues. There are in <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> Sixteen Settled Mini&s;ters; and of them, Six only are tran&s;iently &s;aid to have by Sub&s;crip|tion in&s;ured the Inoculated, whereof &s;ome, finding Con|tentions
<PB REF="002331_0004_0FDBC9A79F8EA8B8">
to &s;pread among their Flocks, out of a Chri&s;ti|an Spirit of Meekne&s;s, forbear giving further Occa&s;ions for Animo&s;ities; only Two or Three of the whole Num|ber have exceeded their Bounds, and wrote practically on a <HI>medical</HI> Subject, for which they were by the <HI>Practitio|ners</HI> called in Que&s;tion, not pretending to meddle with their Life and Conver&s;ation or Mini&s;try; pre&s;uming at lea&s;t that a Par&s;on out of his Office may be fallible.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t of their vile <HI>Calumnys</HI> I impute rather to an unguarded Pa&s;&s;ion, than to their Ignorance of the World and good Manners, or a Propen&s;ity and Inclination to be malicious. The old <HI>venerable</HI> Dr. <HI>I. M.</HI> de&s;ervedly e&s;teemed by all in this Country, his Name and Character with me &s;hall be &s;acred, no Provocation can oblige me to &s;how him any di&s;re&s;pect; but the Son, a <HI>Degener a Patre,</HI> the <HI>Hero</HI> in this Farce of <HI>Calumny,</HI> is u&s;ed with a Philo&s;ophical Freedom. The Univer&s;ity of <HI>Gla&s;gow</HI> in <HI>Great Britain,</HI> from the Re&s;pect they bear to <HI>New-En|gland,</HI> u&s;ed him kindly, tho' to them <HI>nec de facie quidem notus,</HI> and gratify'd his Vanity with a <HI>D. D.</HI>; he in re|quital calls a Native of <HI>Great Britain</HI> (be&s;ides many vile Names) a meer Stranger, abu&s;es their Country, ridicules their Family Names, makes their Church Di&s;cipline ludicrous, as if they were guilty of &s;tooping to take Cognizance of little trivial Matters. Perhaps he may oblige this his <HI>Alma Mater</HI> to di&s;own him for a Son, as it &s;eems the <HI>Royal Society</HI> have already done, by omit|ting his Name in their yearly Li&s;ts.</P>
<P>In the following Letter, 1. Some har&s;h &s;ounding Words in the Letter concerning Inoculation to <HI>A. S.</HI> &amp;c. which have been mi&s;repre&s;ented and given &s;ome Offence, are explained. 2. The late Calumnys of &s;ome Inocula|tors, particularly in a little Book called, a <HI>Vindication of the Ministers,</HI> are mode&s;tly con&s;idered. 3. The <HI>idea</HI> of a good Voucher in <HI>Natural Hi&s;tory</HI> not con&s;i&s;tent with the Con&s;titution of our principal In&s;trument of Inocula|tion, on who&s;e Word all did at fir&s;t depend. 4. The <HI>Mi|ni&s;ters</HI> Preten&s;ions and Qualifications for the Practice of Phy&s;ick is enquired into. 5.

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>OUR former Intimacy in our Travels and Study abroad is all Apology I &s;hall make for addre&s;&s;ing you with this Let|ter, which contains an Affair local, tem|porary, and relating only to private Per|&s;ons. The De&s;ign of the la&s;t to you pub|li&s;hed in this Place, was, that <HI>Inoculation might be &s;u&s;|pended</HI> from being carried into the Country Towns, be|fore any Method or Contrivance was endeavour'd, to make it more ea&s;y to the <HI>Patient</HI> and &s;afe to the <HI>Neigh|bourhood,</HI> from the Hopes we had that the Severity of the Sea&s;on in a natural and ordinary Way might <HI>check</HI> its further Progre&s;s, or the after Sea&s;on might be <HI>more con|venient</HI> for the Practice, or till their cautious Procedure in <HI>England</HI> might be &s;ome <HI>Guide</HI> to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">. It con|tain'd, you may remember, a few har&s;h &s;ounding Words, not pronounced ab&s;olutely, but as <HI>pathetically</HI> flowing from the Solutions advanced to &s;ome unnatural Argu|ments u&s;ed on the other Side. As Guilt is apt to fly into a Man's Face, &s;o it was here; it put them in a <HI>Pa&s;&s;ion,</HI> which is commonly &s;aid to be incon&s;i&s;tent with Rea&s;on, makes them drop all <HI>Argument</HI> (<HI>we will not en|ter into the Controver&s;y</HI> &s;ays the Vindicator <HI>Page</HI> 11.) and fall on with <HI>Calumny, Srurrility, flat <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> and <HI>Billing&s;|gate,</HI> (a certain Evidence of the Goodne&s;s of their Cau&s;e, or at lea&s;t of their Ability to maintain it) and &s;acrifice the Characters of &s;everal good Men, who endeavouring
<PB N="2" REF="002331_0006_0FDBC9AFB6EF2028">
the good of their Country did publickly advi&s;e two or three Mini&s;ters again&s;t being too impetuous, without Method or Contrivance, to pu&s;h Headlong a <HI>novel</HI> and <HI>dubious Practice</HI> of Con&s;equence in <HI>Phy&s;ick</HI>; this, <HI>with a Clamour,</HI> they call rendring the Mini&s;try vain and ri|diculous.</P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>To obviate the Mi&s;repre&s;entation of &s;ome har&s;h &s;ound|ing Words, in the Letter concerning Inoculation to</HI> A. S. &amp;c. Becau&s;e it is reckoned very unfair and unbecoming a Gentleman, to a&s;&s;ign Names to <HI>Anonymous</HI> Books (where the Author has not the Vanity to think that his Name can be any Recommendation to the Book, or does not value him&s;elf on the Performance) no Man's Name was wrote at Length, excepting Mr. <HI>Colman</HI>'s, (his Name be|ing prefixed to his little Book,) and that only in this Pa&s;&s;age, <HI>Mr.</HI> Colman's <HI>Fever in the Fle&s;h</HI>; that he might have the Honour of this <HI>new Species</HI> of Fever, which has hitherto been overlooked by the eminent ancient and modern <HI>Phy&s;icians.</HI> The Words <HI>Judicious Magistrates and Mini&s;ters</HI> are borrow'd from Dr. <HI>I. M.</HI>'s Rea&s;ons for Ino|culation, and not by way of Ridicule: For as Society is maintain'd by the Reverence of the <HI>Religion</HI> of the Coun|try, and the Re&s;pect due to the Authority of their <HI>Laws,</HI> to derogate from either is the Abhorrence of all good Men. The Experiment was called a <HI>Humour,</HI> (Fancy or Tryal) becau&s;e we are not arrived to that Degree of cer|tainty therein, that may be requi&s;ite to denominate it an <HI>e&s;tabli&s;h'd Practice.</HI></P>
<P>In the Introduction, the Advice to <HI>change Subjects,</HI> that the older Man may write Inoculation Ca&s;es of Con&s;cience, and the younger Man the Theory of a <HI>Phantom he does not understand,</HI> i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> not meant of the Drs. <HI>M&mdash;rs,</HI> but of the Authors of &s;ome Ob&s;ervations, and Ca&s;es of Con&s;ci|ence. As <HI>Tacitus</HI> was very exact in de&s;cribing the Cha|racters of his <HI>Per&s;onages,</HI> &s;uppo&s;ing many Actions of Con|&s;equence to proceed more from their Temperament, than from rational Deductions: So there the <HI>principal Instru|ment</HI> (as the Vindicator calls him) was tran&s;iently cha|racterized in his Natural Philo&s;ophy Capacity, as is hereafter more fully illu&s;trated, without any Reflections on his Life or Mini&s;try. Is it not a Sort of <HI>Impiety</HI> to
<PB N="3" REF="002331_0007_0FDBC9B1DDCA9258">
a&s;&s;ert that a Man dyes in the u&s;e of the Means, if he dye in the voluntary U&s;e of a Practice which by infecting the Neighbourhood, certainly occa&s;ions the Death of ma|ny, and is not without Ri&s;que to him&s;elf? To compare the Difficulties they meet with in their Promoting of the &s;preading of Infection, to tho&s;e our Saviour met with in the Propagation of the Go&s;pel, is not this an <HI>Abu&s;e of the Scripture</HI>? The&s;e A&s;&s;ertions whether <HI>Lay</HI> or <HI>Clergy</HI> may be contradicted, for in this Country we allow of no <HI>Infallibility</HI> from the younge&s;t Clerk to the Pope him&s;elf. To throw the <HI>Odium of Party</HI> on &s;ome Gentlemen who abhor the vile Name of Faction, is de|&s;ervedly called the hight of <HI>A&s;&s;urance.</HI></P>
<P>The Vindicator of the Mini&s;ters calls a Letter pub|li&s;hed in Mr. <HI>Campbells</HI> News Paper, <HI>July</HI> 24. 1721, a <HI>&s;aucy Libel.</HI> I fancy he is be&s;ide him&s;elf; for there is no Mini&s;ter there &s;o much as hinted at, excepting the Re|verend Dr. <HI>C. M.</HI> who is there u&s;ed with Re&s;pect and good Manners, <HI>viz.</HI>
<Q>A certain learned Gentleman of this Place, who upon the fir&s;t Appearance of the Small Pox here, out of a pious and charitable De&s;ign of do|ing Good, apply'd to the Practitioners of the Place, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q>
Or perhaps, becau&s;e that Letter advi&s;es the People to be cautious in the U&s;e of an Experiment novel and dubi|ous, it is called a <HI>&s;aucy Libel</HI>; Is it po&s;&s;ible a rational Man &s;hould be &s;o <HI>impatient of Contradiction.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>The late Calumnies of &s;ome Inoculators, particularly of a little Book called,</HI> A Vindication of the Mini&s;ters, <HI>are modesty con&s;idered.</HI> A <HI>Devoto</HI> di&s;parages Religion by his un&s;ea&s;onable and indi&s;creet Introduction of <HI>Scrip|ture, Church, Mini&s;ters,</HI> &amp;c: By culling, tran&s;po&s;ing, &s;mall alterations of words, &amp;c. the mo&s;t hone&s;t and &s;eri|ous Piece may be made appear <HI>Atheistical, Bla&s;phemous,</HI> and <HI>Trea&s;onable</HI>: This is the mean di&s;ingenuous Artifice u&s;ed by &s;ome of late. The words which &s;ound har&s;h are obvious to every Man, but Solid Argument and Mat|ter of Fact, do not come within the Compa&s;s of every Per&s;ons Capacity and Knowledge: This la&s;t part, tho' the main Point, they neglect, and turn the Controver&s;y on <HI>Calumny,</HI> of which they are very prodigal, and are not to be an&s;wered <HI>in Specie,</HI> without breach of good Man|ners.
<PB N="4" REF="002331_0008_0FDBC9B315C68DF0">
Mini&s;ters ought to &s;how Men their Errors with the greate&s;t <HI>Temper and Humanity</HI>; but the <HI>rever&s;e</HI> of this, to the great Grief of &s;ome of their own People, has too much appeared on this occa&s;ion. A <HI>Roman Catho|lick</HI> writer &s;ays, <HI>It is no mortal Sin to Calumniate &s;afely to pre&s;erve ones Honour</HI>; another &s;ays, <HI>We may lawful|ly Slander any Per&s;on, by charging him with Crimes that are utterly fal&s;e, if again&s;t his Te&s;timony we cannot other|ways defend our &s;elves.</HI> This is a <HI>Popi&s;h</HI> Practice and not to be encouraged.</P>
<P>The late <HI>Pamphlet</HI> called, <HI>A Vindication of the Mini|sters,</HI> is advi&s;edly &s;aid to be wrote by &s;undry Hands; for it is not po&s;&s;ible to Imagine that one Per&s;on of any Degree of good Memory and &s;ound Judgment could &s;o often <HI>contradict</HI> him&s;elf and Matter of Fact; &s;ometimes with one hand throwing the mo&s;t <HI>ful&s;ome Flatteries</HI> on him&s;elf and Brethren, not animadverting to that noted &s;aying, <HI>He that commends him&s;elf, never purcha&s;es our Ap|plau&s;e</HI>; and with the other Hand the foule&s;t Dirt, hit or mi&s;s, acted by this Principle, <HI>Calumniare audacter,</HI> &amp;c. To illu&s;trate this. He &s;ays,
<Q>we cannot but admire, the <HI>Moderation</HI> and con&s;ummate Patience of our Pa&s;tors, a|mid&s;t the&s;e outragious &amp; provoking Abu&s;es and Scan|dals. &mdash; The <HI>Meekne&s;s</HI> of our Mini&s;ters, under the&s;e abu&s;es, imitating their glorious Ma&s;ter, who remained as dumb under the Shearers. &mdash; We are of Opinion that Per&s;ons may differ in their Sentiments, about this Practice, without declaring them&s;elves open Enemies to one another, and neglect Chri&s;tian and civil Con|ver&s;aion,</Q>
How well does this <HI>talley</HI> with their fol|lowing <HI>Scurrilities.</HI>
<Q>Our Practitioners and late Libel|lers. Virulent endeavours of <HI>wicked</HI> men. <HI>Impious</HI> and Satanick Cu&s;tom. Daringly profane. Impudence <HI>brazen</HI> and flagitious.

and many other <HI>Billing&s;gate</HI> Terms of Art.</P>
<P>The <HI>Vindicator</HI> &s;ays,
<Q>Dr. <HI>Mather</HI> di&s;dains to draw his <HI>generous Pen</HI> for his own Vindication, who changes not his Temper for all their invidious Calumnies</Q>;
for the Truth of this I refer to a little Pamphlet called <HI>Remarks,</HI> &amp;c. in which he meekly &s;ays,

The <HI>Church</HI> ought to deliver him over to Satan, for he de&s;erves the highe&s;t Cen&s;ure. De&s;erves to be Scourg'd out of the Country. The Go|vernment ought to bani&s;h him.

with &s;everal more low Expre&s;&s;ions of an angry <HI>brutal Pa&s;&s;ion</HI> in the Manu&s;cript, which the Printer was a&s;hamed to publi&s;h; and all this becau&s;e the <HI>Nature</HI> and <HI>Thread</HI> of the Au|thors <HI>Di&s;cour&s;e</HI> obliged him, to repre&s;ent Dr. <HI>C. M.</HI> as ra&s;h in his proceedings of Inoculation, and fallible in his Natural Philo&s;ophy. What could he have &s;aid more again&s;t one that &s;hould write vile things of our <HI>Charter</HI> and <HI>Government,</HI> of our <HI>Religion</HI> and <HI>Platform,</HI> mo&s;t no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|riou&s;ly vicious and wicked, a <HI>Traitor</HI> and <HI>Bla&s;phe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"></HI>? Are there no Degrees in this Man's Cen&s;ure? Are the&s;e his Philo&s;ophical Arguments and mild Chri&s;tian Re|bukes? A Man's <HI>Life</HI> and <HI>Conver&s;ation</HI> fall within the <HI>ken</HI> of his Neighbour's Eye, the&s;e he might (and would) have faulted, if he had had any handle; but a Man's <HI>Grace,</HI> the <HI>Fear of God</HI> in his heart, are only open to the <HI>Omni&s;cient.</HI></P>
<P>In another Place the <HI>Vindicator of the Mini&s;ters</HI> &s;ays, <HI>Strangers or Abjects, which inhances their Folly, and makes their Impudence the more brazen and flagitious.</HI> Travelling removes National and Country Prejudices, and enlarges the narrow &s;elfi&s;h Soul; but to u&s;e by way of <HI>Odium</HI> the word STRANGER, and couple it with ABJECT, &s;hows this our Travellers <HI>vile, low, abject Spirit,</HI> and that his Travel is lo&s;t. Was he &s;o u&s;ed when in <HI>England</HI>? O Shame! Was his Father or Grandfather &s;o u&s;ed when they came to &s;ettle their abode in this Country?

<Q><L>'Tis &s;trange how &s;ome Mens Tempers &s;uit</L>

<P>Their Methods and procedure are acknowledged <HI>ra&s;h</HI> by many of their own Inoculation Friends; this Man continues to affirm it a <HI>regular Procedure</HI> be &s;etting the Matter in a fal&s;e Light. Is it not Fact, that Dr. <HI>C. M.</HI> after di&s;per&s;ing his circular Letters, before the Practitioners could have time to meet, con&s;ult, and make a Return; <HI>privately</HI> &s;ets <HI>B&mdash;n</HI> to work, without acquainting the Town&s;men and Practitioners. About this Time the In|fection had got into &s;everal Hou&s;es, &s;o that Watche<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> could not conveniently he obtained for them all; be the Ju&s;tices and Select-Men did not neglect the Pre&s;erva|tion of the Town (as this Man would in&s;inuate) and al|low <HI>Infection</HI> to &s;pread at any Rate. <HI>v.g.</HI> The <HI>Dead</HI> for &s;ome con&s;iderable time thereafter were not allow'd to be carry'd out till <HI>late</HI> in the Night, when People were retired. Upon the Noi&s;e of <HI>Inoculation</HI> being attempt|ed, the <HI>Justices</HI> and <HI>Select-Men</HI> appointed a Meeting of all the Practitioners, who <HI>unanimou&s;ly gave their Opinion again&s;t it till further Light,</HI> which was accordingly pub|li&s;hed by the Select-Men, and the Practice is forbidden; but by the In&s;tigation of this Man and his Accompli|ces, they proceed in <HI>Contempt</HI> of the Magi&s;trates, and in Contradiction to the Practitioners. Is this a regular Procedure?</P>
<P>If a Dr. <HI>C. M.</HI> in any other Country &s;hould meet with the <HI>Vindication,</HI> &amp;c. finding him in expre&s;s Words a&s;|&s;erting the <HI>uninterupted and remarkable Succe&s;s of this Method; &mdash; the con&s;tant Succe&s;s of this Experiment,</HI> &amp;c. he would directly publi&s;h, that <HI>not one ever dy'd of Ino|culation the&s;e Forty One Years, always producing the most favourable Sort; &mdash; a Practice well vouched,</HI> &amp;c. what
<PB N="10" REF="002331_0014_0FDBC9CAB6996AC0">
fatal Errors may not <HI>Impartiality</HI> lead a <HI>credulous</HI> Man into? Such an Account as this may do with &s;ome of their Corre&s;pondents abroad, till contradicted by better Hands; but here it is ridiculous and &s;illy, we all know that &s;everal have dy'd of the Practice, and that many have &s;uffered much.</P>
<P>How trifling is it for us, who have had the Experi|ence of Two or Three Hundred Inoculated, to appeal to a Man who only conjectures it may be of U&s;e, and has not had the Opportunities of adducing more that <HI>Two In&s;tances,</HI> and the&s;e of <HI>Children,</HI> who&s;e Age might con|tribute to their having them favourable either Way; I mean Dr. <HI>Harris</HI>'s Di&s;&s;ertation on the Inoculation of the Small Pox; the Ju&s;tne&s;s of the Ab&s;tract from it, I pa&s;s over, not having &s;een the Original. From it we learn no more concerning Inoculation, than, <HI>v. g.</HI> may be learnt from Dr. <HI>Lower</HI>'s (the more eminent Man) Account of <HI>Transfu&s;ion,</HI> addre&s;&s;ed to the Honourable Mr. <HI>Boyle,</HI> publi&s;hed by the <HI>Royal Society,</HI> and with more Earne&s;tne&s;s recommended, and con&s;equently equally or better vouched, after this Man's weak way of rea&s;oning. Notwith&s;tanding of this <HI>Di&s;&s;ertation, Timonius, Pylari|nus,</HI> and many more Accounts of the Affair that have not come to our Hands; we find them &s;o <HI>cautious</HI> at home, that it was &s;ome Time thereafter before any <HI>Try|als</HI> were made, and the&s;e by Permi&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Govern|ment</HI> on the Bodies of Per&s;ons <HI>dead in Law.</HI> He advi|&s;es Exactne&s;s in <HI>Regimen,</HI> which is ab&s;olutely requi&s;ite, to know the Advantage of any new <HI>Experiment</HI>; we to our Shame boa&s;t and glory in our not u&s;ing any. The Con&s;equences he does not &s;o much as hint at, which are Difficulties to be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed. However, Dr. <HI>Harris</HI> ab&s;tracted has this good Effect, it proves a <HI>tem|porary Cordial</HI> to &s;ome of the Inoculated.</P>
<P>Since my la&s;t to you, the <HI>Small Pox</HI> has made little or no progre&s;s in the Country; Our News Papers tell us, that in &s;ome Towns it is entirely cea&s;ed, in others much abated. Who then but Madmen, would have advi&s;ed Inoculation in the &s;evere&s;t Sea&s;on to tho&s;e who are like forever to e&s;cape the Small Pox? In this Town &s;e|veral Hundreds have e&s;caped, and it is probable many
<PB N="11" REF="002331_0015_0FDBC9B5C64A88E0">
more might have e&s;caped (as was the Ca&s;e Nineteen Years ago) if Inoculation had not rendred the Infection &s;o univer&s;al and inten&s;e. La&s;t Small Pox the Month of the greate&s;t Mortality (<HI>December,</HI> a &s;evere Winter Month) did not exceed 80 Per&s;ons; at this Time the Month of the greate&s;t Mortality (<HI>October,</HI> a favourable Autumn Month) exceeded Four Hundred burials, which is more than all that dyed of the Small Pox Nineteen Years ago. For the three Months of <HI>September, October,</HI> and <HI>November</HI> la&s;t, in which Inoculation prevailed, the Town was a meer Ho&s;pital, and we bury'd Seven Hun|dred and Sixty Per&s;ons. The la&s;t Small Pox &s;pread <HI>gradually</HI> in the extent of ten or a dozen Months, and va&s;t Numbers e&s;cape; Inoculation of the Small Pox this Time &s;et us all in a <HI>Flame,</HI> and in half the Time leaves few People exempt from its rage. With what Face can any Man call our Methods of Inoculation a regular pro|cedure?</P>
<P>I heartily wi&s;h Succe&s;s to this and all other <HI>Means</HI> de&s;ign'd to alleviate the Epidemick Di&s;tempers incident to Mankind; whether ca&s;ually di&s;covered, or ingeni|ou&s;ly contrived by the Sons of <HI>AE&s;culapius</HI>: But ra&s;h|ne&s;s and head&s;trong irregular procedure I &s;hall for ever exclaim again&s;t, e&s;pecially that dete&s;table Wickedne&s;s <HI>of &s;preading Infection.</HI></P>
<P>That I may not incur the Cen&s;ure of <HI>Scribling,</HI> I pro|mi&s;e to neglect and de&s;pi&s;e, all that may come from the other Side by way of <HI>bare Affirmation, Bomba&s;t, Calumny, Doggrel Dialogues,</HI> &amp;c. but if <HI>Solid Rea&s;oning,</HI> well vou|ched <HI>Matter of Fact,</HI> and &s;uch like appear again&s;t any thing a&s;&s;erted, or conjectured by the <HI>Practitioners</HI> in op|po&s;ition to the <HI>ra&s;h procedure of the Inoculators</HI>; I doubt not but they will take it Kindly and Friendly.</P>
