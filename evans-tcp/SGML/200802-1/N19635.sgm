<HEAD>A DISCOURSE upon the Slave-Trade, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THE members of this re&s;pecta|ble Society, by whom I have been invited to deliver a di&s;cour&s;e before them, at this their an|nual meeting, on the Slave-Trade, and the con|&s;equent &s;lavery of the Africans&mdash;and all tho&s;e who are pre&s;ent on this occa&s;ion, will not expect that any thing <HI>new</HI> will be &s;aid, on a &s;ubject which has been &s;o much canva&s;&s;ed of late, and on which &s;o many have written, and &s;o fully expo&s;ed the unpa|ralleled unrighteou&s;ne&s;s, inhumanity and cruelty, and the odious and horrible attendants of it; by which great light has been thrown upon it, and the attention of millions turned to it; and they have been led to execrate it, as a mo&s;t &s;hocking, outrageous violation of all the rights of man.&mdash;And there are none, or very few, now, except tho&s;e who&s;e minds are blinded, and their hearts hardened, by cu&s;tom and their &s;uppo&s;ed intere&s;t, who do not condemn it, as contrary to the true and be&s;t intere&s;t of &s;ociety; and therefore think all lawful endeavours ought to be exerted to &s;up|pre&s;s and aboli&s;h it forever.</P>
<P>BUT as it is not ea&s;y fully to explore this bu|&s;ine&s;s, and comprehend it in all its length and breadth, and realize all the evils included in it, it is highly proper and important often to renew our meditations upon it, and to take tho&s;e methods which are &s;uited to impre&s;s our minds, and the
<PB N="4" REF="025631_0004_0FCE9DD9E560AA20">
minds of others, more and more with the iniqui|ty of this practice, viewed in every different light, and in all the evil con&s;equences of it.</P>
<P>IN this view, and to promote &s;uch a de&s;ign, the attention, patience and candour of this re&s;pectable audience are a&s;ked to the following ob&s;ervations&punc; which &s;hall be introduced by &s;ome of the la&s;t words of the benevolent REDEEMER OF MAN, who came not to de&s;troy men's lives, but to &s;ave&mdash;which he &s;pake to his di&s;ciples, when he was about to leave the world, and a&s;cend to heaven, record|ed by the Evangeli&s;t Mark, 16th chapter, and 15th ver&s;e, of his go&s;pel:</P>
<P>GO YE INTO ALL THE WORLD, AND PREACH THE GOSPEL TO EVERY CREATURE.</P>
<P>THIS direction and command is an expre&s;&s;ion of the greate&s;t benevolence to man. When the Son of God had become incarnate, and taken upon him the form of a &s;ervant, and was obedient unto death, even the death of the cro&s;s, in order to make atonement for the &s;ins of men, and bring in everla&s;ting righteou&s;ne&s;s, that God might be ju&s;t, and the ju&s;tifier of him that believeth in Je&s;us, and had ri&s;en from the dead, he ordered that this good news &s;hould be publi&s;hed through the whole world, and the offer of this &s;alvation be made to all mankind, of whatever nation or complexion, whether Jews or Gentiles; the more civilized or barbarians, rich or poor, white or black: this being the only remedy for lo&s;t man, &s;uited to re|cover him from that &s;tate of darkne&s;s, &s;in and mi|&s;ery, in which the world of mankind lay, and mu&s;t peri&s;h forever, were it not for this &s;alvation.&mdash;"Neither is there &s;alvation in any other; for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby they can be &s;aved."</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="025631_0005_0FCE9E22DA3CBC60">
AND as this is an infinitely kind and benevolent injunction, it points out and commands a duty, an employment, which mu&s;t be mo&s;t agreeable and plea&s;ing to every benevolent mind, whatever la|bour and expence it may require. And they may rea&s;onably think them&s;elves highly favoured and honoured, to whom ability and opportunity are given to preach the go&s;pel, the un&s;earchable riches of Chri&s;t, to any of their fellow-men; or who are under advantage to promote this de&s;ign, by any exertion in their power.</P>
<P>As the go&s;pel affords the only relief for fallen man, &s;o it is a &s;ufficient and complete one, where the &s;pirit of it is cordially imbibed, and it is pro|perly improved for the purpo&s;es which it is &s;uited to promote. It rai&s;es &s;inners from the greate&s;t moral depravity, guilt and mi&s;ery, to a &s;tate of light, pardon and peace, and brings them finally to the enjoyment of complete and endle&s;s felicity.</P>
<P>THIS in&s;titution of heaven, when properly at|tended to, under&s;tood, and cordially embraced, turns men from darkne&s;s to marvellous light. If it finds them in a &s;tate of &s;avage ignorance and barbarity, it civilizes them, and forms them to be intelligent and good members of &s;ociety. It &s;ubdues the &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, pride and worldly-minded|ne&s;s of men, and all their inordinate lu&s;ts; and "teaches them to deny ungodline&s;s and worldly lu&s;ts&punc; and to live &s;oberly, righteou&s;ly and godly in this pre&s;ent world." It rai&s;es the mind to the &s;ight and contemplation of the mo&s;t &s;ublime, im|portant and entertaining objects, and manife&s;ts tho&s;e truths, and gives that light, which are receiv|ed with plea&s;ing love and admiration; which make men truly wi&s;e, and animate them to the practice of every per&s;onal&punc; &s;ocial and religious duty. It forms
<PB N="6" REF="025631_0006_0FCE9E2406561200">
men to uprightne&s;s, and the practice of righteou&s;|ne&s;s; to univer&s;al benevolence and goodne&s;s, teaching them to love their neighbour as them|&s;elves, and to do to other men as they would that others &s;hould do unto them. So far as it &s;preads, and has influence on the hearts and lives of men, it bani&s;hes the manifold evils under which man|kind have groaned in all ages, and introduces peace, love and harmony, among men, and unites them together into a happy &s;ociety, in which every one puts on bowels of mercies, kindne&s;s, humble|ne&s;s of mind, meekne&s;s and long-&s;uffering, for|bearing one another, and forgiving each other in love: each one &s;tudying and exerting him&s;elf to do good to all men, according to his ability and opportunity. At the &s;ame time, it forms men to the mo&s;t &s;incere uniform and rational piety, in the exerci&s;e of love to God and the Redeemer, and to all his friends and &s;ervants; and they have joy and peace in believing, and &s;erving Je&s;us Chri&s;t; and their hope of eternal life in the kingdom of Chri&s;t is built and flouri&s;hes on the be&s;t and mo&s;t &s;ure foundation.</P>
<P>THIS command of Chri&s;t, to preach the go&s;pel to all the nations in the world, re&s;pects not only the Apo&s;tles and di&s;ciples who then heard him &s;peak, and the mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel in ge|neral, who have &s;ince been, or are now, or &s;hall be appointed to that work; but is extended to all Chri&s;tians in every age of the church, requiring them in all proper ways, according to their ability, &s;tations and opportunities, to promote this bene|volent de&s;ign, and exert them&s;elves for the fur|therance of the go&s;pel; that, if po&s;&s;ible, all may hear, and &s;hare in the happy effects of it. They <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ho are not called to be preachers of the go&s;pel,
<PB N="7" REF="025631_0007_0FCE9E27A69073A8">
may in many ways a&s;&s;i&s;t tho&s;e who are &s;ent forth to this work, and do much to forward the propa|gation and &s;preading of Chri&s;tianity; not only helping by their prayers, but by liberal contribu|tions of their &s;ub&s;tance, and by many other la|bours and exertions. Every true di&s;ciple of Chri&s;t, who under&s;tands the go&s;pel, and prizes it above &s;ilver and gold, and who&s;e heart is expand|ed with love to Chri&s;t, and benevolence to his fel|low-men, mu&s;t not only wi&s;h and pray that all nations may enjoy the ble&s;&s;ings of it, and come to the knowledge of this &s;aving truth; but con&s;iders it as an un&s;peakable privilege to be in any way, and in the lea&s;t degree, an in&s;trument of promot|ing this de&s;ign, whatever labour and expence it may require. And it is owing to the great and inexcu&s;able wickedne&s;s of men, that the go&s;pel did not &s;oon &s;pread all over the world, after the re&s;urrection and a&s;cen&s;ion of Chri&s;t, and was not embraced by all men from that day down to this time; which would have prevented the many and dreadful evils which have reigned in the world in all this period, and introduced a glorious &s;cene, and &s;eries of happy events, which exceed our pre|&s;ent conception. Therefore it can be attributed to nothing but the depravity of mankind, that the command of the Saviour has not been obeyed, and all men have not been made to &s;hare in the &s;aving ble&s;&s;ings of the go&s;pel; but that it has been, and &s;till is, &s;o un&s;ucce&s;sful in the world.</P>
<P>WOULD we know the nature and excellence of Chri&s;tianity, and the happy tendency of it to pro|mote the good of mankind, both temporal and eternal, we mu&s;t not expect to learn it from the general appearance of it in what is called the Chri&s;tian part of the world, and the effect it now
<PB N="8" REF="025631_0008_0FCE9E9006938860">
has on the greate&s;t part of tho&s;e who enjoy the light of it. But we mu&s;t look into our Bibles, where it is properly and to the be&s;t advantage de&s;cribed, and all the doctrines and precepts which it contains are plainly written by the pen of in&s;piration. And there we are taught the effect it had on tho&s;e who cordially embraced the go&s;pel in the days of the Apo&s;tles, and to what an excellent character it formed tho&s;e who became true Chri&s;tians. And we are informed by credible hi&s;torians what a hap|py effect it had in the world, where it &s;pread and was embraced for the fir&s;t two or three centuries af|ter the a&s;cen&s;ion of Chri&s;t, until the admini&s;tration of it was perverted by wicked men, who, with all their worldline&s;s and pride, crept into the church, and perverted Chri&s;tianity in its very nature and de&s;ign, both in doctrine and practice, to accom|modate it to their &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s and pride, and &s;o as to an&s;wer their own worldly ends. And there have been numbers, who in all ages &s;ince, in the mid&s;t of the general apo&s;tacy and corruption, have held fa&s;t the form of found doctrine contained in divine revelation; and in their life and practice have been the humble, harmle&s;s followers of Chri&s;t, in the mid&s;t of a crooked and perver&s;e generation, among whom they have &s;hone as lights in the world, exhibiting an amiable example of faith, pa|tience, righteou&s;ne&s;s and benevolence, of which ex|cellent character, we tru&s;t, there is a number now in the Chri&s;tian world, and among us.</P>
<P>AMONG many other evil things which have pre|vailed in this apo&s;tate world, are tyranny and &s;lavery, introduced and practi&s;ed by the lu&s;ts, the &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, pride and avarice of men; which have been the &s;ource of un&s;peakable unhappine&s;s and mi&s;ery. The go&s;pel is &s;uited to root the&s;e evils
<PB N="9" REF="025631_0009_0FCE9E93ED849A68">
out of the world, and wholly aboli&s;h &s;lavery; and will have this effect where it is fully and faithfully preached, and cordially received and obeyed. For where this takes place, no one will forfeit his li|berty, and therefore mu&s;t have a right to it; and no man will make a &s;lave of another, were it in his power, who has not forfeited his liberty by the &s;entence of proper judges; for in &s;o doing he would act contrary to the precepts of Chri&s;tianity.</P>
<P>THE following precept of our Lord and Sa|viour, "All things what&s;oever ye would that men &s;hould do unto you, do ye even &s;o to them," which is included in loving our neighbour as our|&s;elves, will &s;et at liberty every &s;lave who has not forfeited his freedom, or to whom &s;lavery can be con&s;idered as unde&s;irable, and a calamity, when|ever it is properly regarded, and reduced to prac|tice.</P>
<P>CHRISTIANITY being, in the nature and tend|ency of it, and the particular precepts which it contains, thus oppo&s;ed to &s;lavery, did gradually, even in its mo&s;t corrupt &s;tate, root it out among the nations in the Chri&s;tian world, &s;o that it was almo&s;t if not wholly aboli&s;hed for &s;ome centuries, until it took place again, in a manner and degree which was never known before among any nation or people, &s;ince the world began, in the abomina|ble Slave-Trade with the Africans, and their con&s;equent &s;lavery. That this bu&s;ine&s;s, which is &s;uch a gro&s;s and open violation not only of the ge|nius and precepts of Chri&s;tianity, but of the rights and feelings of humanity, &s;hould be undertaken and carried on by nations who call them&s;elves Chri&s;tians, and by individuals who bear that name, is truly a&s;toni&s;hing! It is impo&s;&s;ible fully to de|&s;cribe, or to have an adequate conception of the
<PB N="10" REF="025631_0010_0FCE9E954A45F1A0">
crimes which have been committed in this bu&s;i|ne&s;s, or the evils which have attended it. If a man of ob&s;ervation, di&s;cernment and humanity, had attended this trade many years, and &s;pent the re&s;idue of his life in the We&s;t-Indies, under the be&s;t advantage to &s;ee the inhumanity and cruelty, and the various crimes which take place in the treat|ment of the haves, and the innumerable mi&s;eries which they &s;uffer, he would after all have but a very partial idea and conception of the whole; and know but little, compared with all of this kind which takes place. How low and &s;aint, then, are our conceptions of this enormous evil! The Great Omnipotent alone, who will bring every work of man into judgment, with every &s;ecret thing, has a full, clear and perfect knowledge of the whole of this great evil.</P>
<P>SUFFICE it now, in a few words, to &s;ay, that by this trade in the bodies and &s;ouls of men, millions have been violently torn from their native coun|try, and from every thing dear to them; in the ac|compli&s;hing of which, fire and &s;word, war and de&s;olation, and &s;laughter of numbers exceeding ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> reckoning, have taken place through a va&s;t extent of country; and multitudes have been in|duced to betray, &s;teal and &s;ell their countrymen and neighbours. Many thou&s;ands of the&s;e, thus taken from their country, and all the enjoyments of life and liberty, and all their deare&s;t connexions, have died on board the &s;hips, in their pa&s;&s;age to the We&s;t-Indies, or to other countries; and the re&s;t have been &s;old like brute bea&s;ts into perpetual &s;lavery, with their po&s;terity after them; where the mo&s;t of them are treated in a manner beyond de|&s;cription inhuman and cruel, by owners, ma&s;ters and over&s;eers, many, if not the mo&s;t of whom, are
<PB N="11" REF="025631_0011_0FCE9E99084D2710">
hardened again&s;t all the &s;ettings of humanity to|wards their &s;laves, and are them&s;elves a nui&s;ance and burden to the earth, &s;o that the We&s;t-India i&s;lands in general are become the greate&s;t re&s;em|blance of the infernal regions that can be found in this world.</P>
<P>IN this general, but very &s;uperficial and &s;canty view of the Slave-Trade, and the &s;lavery con|nected with it, who can forbear pronouncing, that they who have encouraged, pro&s;ecuted or &s;upport|ed this traffic in their fellow-men, though &s;ome of them may have done it in ignorance and unbelief, have really been the emi&s;&s;aries of &s;atan, and agents for him who delights in the wickedne&s;s and mi&s;ery of mankind? And though they live in Chri&s;tian lands, and call them&s;elves Chri&s;tians, and what|ever plau&s;ible pretences they may make, they have all been really acting mo&s;t contrary to the nature and precepts of Chri&s;tianity, and doing the works of the devil: and nothing can be more di&s;honour|able to the go&s;pel, and the author of it, than to at|tempt to reconcile this practice with Chri&s;tianity.</P>
<P>THIS indeed has been attempted by &s;ome; and, among other things, it has been pretended, that this treatment of the Africans was right and com|mendable, as it was the way to chri&s;tianize them, by bringing them from a heathen to a Chri&s;tian land. But is this obedience to the command of the Saviour, "Go into all the world, and preach the go&s;pel to every creature?" Is it not directly contrary to this command? Does this direct men to go into heathen lands, and take men by force from their own country, and de&s;troy a great part of them, and reduce the re&s;t to the mo&s;t abject &s;lavery, in order to make Chri&s;tians of them? Does it not rather command us to carry the go&s;pel to them; and to
<PB N="12" REF="025631_0012_0FCE9E97A80A7530">
take all proper pains, in the mo&s;t friendly manner, to in&s;truct and per&s;uade them to embrace it, with|out any force or compul&s;ion, that they may be hap|py in their own <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">and while they live, and be &s;aved from &s;in and mi&s;ery forever? Do the dealers in &s;laves make any attempts to carry the go&s;pel to Africa, and propagate it there? Do they &s;ay a word to their &s;laves about the go&s;pel, or do any thing that tends to lead them to embrace it? Has not their whole conduct, in their treatment of the Africans, a direct and &s;trong tendency to the con|trary? The Slave-Trade, in the manner in which it has been carried on, tends to beget the &s;tronge&s;t prejudices again&s;t Chri&s;tianity in the inhabitants of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">a&s;t continent of Africa, and actually has done it in many nations; and nothing could have been done by tho&s;e who bear the name of Chri&s;|tians more effectually to prevent the introduction of the go&s;pel into that part of the world, and more directly to counteract the command of Chri&s;t to preach the go&s;pel to them. And how do tho&s;e who are brought from that country, and put into a &s;tate of &s;lavery, and treated as the &s;laves general|ly are in the We&s;t-Indies, naturally and unavoid|ably look upon the&s;e dealers in &s;laves, who are call|ed <HI>Chri&s;tians?</HI> Is i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> po&s;&s;ible they &s;hould look upon them in a better light than we do the &s;avages, not to &s;ay the inhabitants of the infernal regions? What then mu&s;t they think of Chri&s;tianity? Is this the way to per&s;uade them to be Chri&s;tians? What could be done more to prevent it? Many millions of the&s;e poor creatures have doubtle&s;s lived and died with the greate&s;t aver&s;ion from Chri&s;tianity, and even the name of a Chri&s;tian, from the treatment they have received from tho&s;e who have called them&s;elves Chri&s;tians. And if any
<PB N="13" REF="025631_0013_0FCE9E9DF2DE9540">
have embraced the go&s;pel, and become real Chri&s;|tians, in circum&s;tances tending &s;o &s;trongly to pre|judice again&s;t&punc; it, this mu&s;t be a&s;cribed to the extra|ordinary, wonderful, and no le&s;s than miraculous interpo&s;ition of divine pow<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> and grace; and no thanks are due to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> in &s;laves, who&s;e whole conduct has been counteracted in the&s;e in|&s;tances. And can it be believed, that the&s;e deal|ers in &s;laves have carried on this unchri&s;tian, in|human and cruel bu&s;ine&s;s, with a view to chri&s;tianize tho&s;e whom they thus injure and oppre&s;s, or from any motives of benevolence or humanity? This &s;eems impo&s;&s;ible. But if this were po&s;&s;ible, the treat|ment of the&s;e &s;laves demon&s;trates that no &s;uch mo|tives exi&s;t, while no proper methods are taken to in&s;truct them in Chri&s;tianity; and in mo&s;t in&s;tances there has been not only no care taken to in&s;truct them, but con&s;tant care and exertions to prevent it, added to the prejudices again&s;t Chri&s;tianity which have been mentioned. And there is no rea|&s;on to con&s;ider tho&s;e many millions of &s;laves, who have been made &s;o by this trade, as under any bet|ter advantages for in&s;truction, or to become Chri&s;|tians, than if they had lived and died in their own country, a few in&s;tances only excepted. No! this bu&s;ine&s;s has been begun, and carried on, from that &s;ordid &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s and avarice, which fortify men's hearts again&s;t the truths and precepts of the go&s;|pel, and will lead them to do the work of the evil one, in order to get money, and promote what they con&s;ider to be their worldly intere&s;t.</P>
<P>HAD all tho&s;e who have had a hand in this anti|chri&s;tian bu&s;ine&s;s, by which &s;o many millions of our fellow-men have been murdered, or treated as brutes, or both, been di&s;po&s;ed to take as much pains, and be at as great co&s;t, to &s;end the go&s;pel
<PB N="14" REF="025631_0014_0FCE9E9F9EE39F90">
to Africa, and in&s;truct and chri&s;tianize the many nations in that part of the world, as they have taken, and expended, to en&s;lave and de&s;troy them, and thus prejudice them again&s;t Chri&s;tianity, they would probably have been the means of &s;preading the go&s;pel over that va&s;t continent, of civilizing tho&s;e barbarous nations and of the &s;alvation of millions; and would have prevented the de&s;truc|tion and mi&s;ery of which they have been the oc|ca&s;ion and in&s;truments; and would have had the reward of &s;uch a benevolent work, and e&s;caped the guilt which now lies upon them, and the awful con&s;equence!</P>
<P>THIS ob&s;ervation opens a &s;cene to our view, which is enough to overwhelm the attentive, pi|ous mind, and mu&s;t therefore be now only men|tioned. A future judgment, an eternity to come, will unfold the whole, of which we can now have but a tran&s;ient glimp&s;e.</P>
<P>THIS enormous iniquity, and wide-&s;preading evil, the Slave-Trade, with its con&s;equences, which has been carried on and advanced to &s;uch a degree for more than a century, by kings and their peo|ple in the Chri&s;tian world, is an evidence, among many others, and &s;erves to confirm the opinion, that the &s;ixth vial, mentioned in the &s;ixteenth chapter of the Revelation, has been running dur|ing this time. It is there predicted, that under this vial three unclean &s;pirits, the &s;pirits of devils, working miracles, or wonderful things, &s;hould go forth to the whole world, to gather them together to the battle of that great day of God Almighty.</P>
<P>THE work of the&s;e &s;pirits is to excite men, e&s;pecially in the Chri&s;tian world, to extraordinary and wonderful degrees of wickedne&s;s, by which they unite in arming them&s;elves again&s;t heaven,
<PB N="15" REF="025631_0015_0FCE9EA08E3C1AA0">
and are prepared for the judgments which will fol|low. Who can attend to the Slave-Trade, in the manner in which it has been pro&s;ecuted, with the extent and con&s;equences of it, and not be convinced that the hand and power of &s;atan has been <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> extraordinary degree exerted and manife&s;ted in it, &s;tirring men up to a kind and degree of wicked|ne&s;s and mi&s;chief, which was not known before?</P>
<P>AND &s;hall this &s;hameful practice, this evil, which has got &s;uch deep root, and is &s;pread &s;o far and wide, never have an end? Can <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> be put to tho&s;e wicked men, who are devouring their fel|low-men, who are more righteous than they? Mu&s;t this gro&s;s and open violation of the rights of man, of the laws of God, and the benevolent re|ligion of the Saviour, continue forever? Shall the horrid &s;cene of unrighteou&s;ne&s;s, violence, cruelty and mi&s;ery, which has &s;o long taken place in the We&s;t-Indies and Africa, never be aboli&s;hed?</P>
<P>THANKS be to God! He has a&s;&s;ured us, that all the&s;e works of the devil &s;hall be de&s;troyed; and that the time is ha&s;tening on, when all the people &s;hall be righteous and benevolent, and there &s;hall be none to de&s;troy or hurt in all the earth. And what has taken place of late, gives rea&s;on of hope and confidence that this &s;ore evil will &s;oon be made to cea&s;e. The attention of thou&s;ands and millions has been awakened, and turned to this &s;ubject; much has been written upon it, and light and conviction have had a ra|pid and exten&s;ive circulation. Numerous &s;ocie|ties have been voluntarily formed, wholly to abo|li&s;h this evil; and there is rea&s;on to conclude, that this light and conviction, and the&s;e exertions, will continue and increa&s;e, till the Slave-Traders &s;hall be utterly de&s;troyed.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="025631_0016_0FCE9EA2079FEB68">
BUT why is this work &s;till oppo&s;ed or neglected by any? Why are not the cries of the millions of Africans in bondage heard by all? Why do they make no more impre&s;&s;ion on the public mind, and rou&s;e all to feel for the wretchedne&s;s of &s;o great a part of their fellow-men, and to exertions for their relief? Why is the Briti&s;h Parliament &s;o &s;low to aboli&s;h the Slave-Trade, and no more in|fluenced by the evidence laid before them of the cruelties and murders which attend this traffic, and of the moral and political evils produced by it; and by the repeated, earne&s;t and powerful ap|plications made to them?</P>
<P>AND as to &s;ome of us Americans, what &s;hall we &s;ay? We have rea&s;on to reflect with painful &s;hame upon the hand we have had in this iniquity; by which &s;o many thou&s;ands of our fellow-men, as good by nature as we are, have been de&s;troyed, or put into a &s;tate of the mo&s;t abject &s;lavery, in the We&s;t-Indies, or brought to this continent, and &s;old like cattle, and in mo&s;t in&s;tances treated as if they were not men!</P>
<P>IN the year 1774, when Britain appeared to threaten a war with us, and di&s;po&s;ed to deny to us &s;ome part of the liberty which we claimed, and we had a pro&s;pect of entering into a bloody con|te&s;t in defence of our own rights, the Slave-Trade, which had been practi&s;ed by us, appeared &s;o in|con&s;i&s;tent with our contending for our own liber|ty, that a Congre&s;s, which then repre&s;ented the&s;e now United States, made a &s;olemn re&s;olution, in the name of all the people whom they repre&s;ented, in the following words: "We will neither import nor purcha&s;e any &s;laves imported, after the fir&s;t day of December next, after which time <HI>we will wholly di&s;continue</HI> the Slave-Trade&punc; and will nei|ther

be concerned in it our&s;elves, nor will we hire our ve&s;&s;els, or &s;ell our commodities or manufac|tures to tho&s;e who are concerned in it." And all the people appeared to acquie&s;ce in this re&s;olution, as rea&s;onable, important and nece&s;&s;ary, in order to act a con&s;i&s;tent part, while contending for their own liberties, and to have any ground of hope in the protection and &s;miles of a righteous God, and &s;ucce&s;s in the &s;truggle into which we were e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">er|ing. With this re&s;olution we entered the com|bat; and God appeared to be on our &s;ide, and wrought wonders in our favour&punc; di&s;appointed tho&s;e who ro&s;e up again&s;t us, and e&s;tabli&s;hed us a free and independent nation.</P>
<P>AFTER all this, could it have been expected, would it have been believed, if predicted, that &s;uch a re&s;olution, &s;o rea&s;onable and important, on which the hope of &s;ucce&s;s was in a great mea&s;ure grounded, and which was doubtle&s;s one mean of it, &s;hould be &s;o far forgotten and counteracted, that a Convention, met to form a con&s;titution, could not agree upon one, unle&s;s it did &s;ecure the continuance of the importation of &s;laves, for a number of years at lea&s;t? That the Congre&s;s of the United States &s;hould &s;o long neglect to &s;up|pre&s;s this trade, &s;o far as it is acknowledged they have authority to do it, through the oppo&s;ition made to &s;uch a mea&s;ure by a &s;mall minority? That notwith&s;tanding laws have been made, by a number of the&s;e States, prohibiting this trade in human fle&s;h, it is yet carried on openly <HI>(horre&s;co referens)</HI> e&s;pecially in this State, and yet the law be eluded, and cannot be executed? That there are hundreds of thou&s;ands of &s;laves in the&s;e States, and no effectual mea&s;ures are taken, where the mo&s;t of them are, to give them a proper education, and
<PB N="18" REF="025631_0018_0FCE9EA74BFD0010">
emancipate them, as &s;oon as it may be done con|&s;i&s;tent with their be&s;t good, and that of the pub|li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">?</P>
<P>WHEN all this is taken into view by the truly pious, who fear God, and believe his word, is it to be wondered at, that their fle&s;h trembleth for fear of the righteous judgments of God? Are they to be condemned as &s;uper&s;titious enthu&s;ia&s;ts? Have we not all rea&s;on to fear that the vengeance of hea|ven will fall upon us, as a people, in ways per|haps which are not now thought of, unle&s;s we repent and reform?</P>
<P>BUT may we not hope for better things? That this evil practice will be better inve&s;tigated, and &s;oon utterly &s;uppre&s;&s;ed? That benevolence and compa&s;&s;ion toward the mi&s;erable Africans will be &s;o &s;en&s;ibly, and with &s;uch &s;trength, exerci&s;ed to|wards them, by the people in general, that all pro|per mea&s;ures will be taken to make them a free and happy people? And if it be nece&s;&s;ary, in order to this, that they &s;hould return to Africa, the conti|nent which &s;eems to be be&s;t &s;uited to their con&s;ti|tution, may we not wi&s;h and hope that &s;uch a de|&s;ire to compen&s;ate them, as far as we may, for the injuries we have done them, and &s;uch a &s;pirit of benevolence will be excited, that we &s;hall with cheerfulne&s;s contribute every thing nece&s;&s;ary to an&s;wer this end?</P>
<P>WE may hope, that all this dark and dreadful &s;cene will not only have an end, but is de&s;igned by the Mo&s;t High to be the mean of introducing the go&s;pel among the nations in Africa: that tho&s;e who have embraced the go&s;pel, while among us, with all who have been or may be in &s;ome good mea&s;ure civilized and in&s;tructed, will, by our a&s;&s;i&s;tance, return to Africa, and &s;pread the light

Thus all this pa&s;t and pre&s;ent evil which the Africans have &s;uffered by the Slave-|Trade, and the &s;lavery to which &s;o many of them have been reduced, may be the occa&s;ion of an over|balancing good: and it may hereafter appear, as it has in the ca&s;e of Jo&s;eph being &s;old a &s;lave in|to Egypt, and the oppre&s;&s;ion and &s;lavery of the I&s;raelites by the Egyptians, that though the Slave-|Traders have really meant and done that which is evil, yet God has de&s;igned it all for good, the good of which all this evil &s;hall be the occa|&s;ion.</P>
<P>OUGHT not this pro&s;pect to animate us earne&s;tly to pray for &s;uch an happy event, and to exert our|&s;elves to the utmo&s;t to promote it? Can we be in|different and negligent in this matter, without &s;lighting and di&s;obeying the command of Chri&s;t, to go into all the world, and preach the go&s;pel to every creature? And will not &s;uch an attempt to &s;end the go&s;pel to Africa, being willing to &s;pare no expence or labour thus to &s;pread the knowledge of the Saviour among the nations there, be a pro|per expre&s;&s;ion of our love and regard to this bene|volent, important injunction?</P>
<P>To this end, let us be firm, wi&s;e and active, in pur&s;uing every proper mea&s;ure to aboli&s;h the Slave-Trade, and put an end to the &s;lavery of the Africans, which is &s;o contrary to the go&s;pel,

<P>LET us con&s;ult and determine what we may do in favour of the blacks among us, e&s;pecially tho&s;e who are free; in protecting them from oppre&s;&s;ion and injuries; by encouraging and a&s;&s;i&s;ting them to indu&s;try, and a prudent management of their worldly affairs; attempting to reform the vicious, to in&s;truct the ignorant, and promote morality, virtue and religion, among them; and provid|ing for the education of their children in u&s;eful learning, that they may be rai&s;ed to an acknow|ledged equality with the white people; and &s;ome of them, of the mo&s;t promi&s;ing abilities and piety, be fitted to preach the go&s;pel to their brethren in Africa; and that numbers may be the better pre|pared to move to that region, and &s;ettle there, and &s;et an example of indu&s;try and wi&s;dom in cultivat|ing the land of that fertile country; and of the prac|tice of Chri&s;tianity; which will have the be&s;t ten|dency to civilize tho&s;e now barbarous nations, to

IF the former, and we &s;hould cheerfully agree to do this injured people all the ju&s;tice, and &s;hew them all the kindne&s;s in our power, we &s;hould not only take the mo&s;t probable method to avert the divine judgments, and obtain the &s;miles of heaven, and take, perhaps, the be&s;t method in our reach to promote the propagation of the go&s;pel; but we, e&s;pecially &s;ome of the &s;outhern States in the Union, would be delivered from the &s;in and ca|lamity of the &s;lavery which now takes place, which is a great moral and political evil, however in&s;en&s;i|ble they may now be of it.

<HEAD>APPENDIX.</HEAD>
<P>THE propo&s;al of a&s;&s;i&s;ting the blacks among us to go and make a &s;ettlement in Africa, which has been mentioned in the preced|ing di&s;cour&s;e, I have thought to be of &s;uch im|portance, as to require a more particular explana|tion to be laid before the public, with the rea&s;ons for it, for their con&s;ideration&punc; hoping that, if it be generally approved, it will excite tho&s;e united generous exertions which are nece&s;&s;ary, in order to effect it.</P>
<P>THERE are a con&s;iderable number of free blacks in New-England, and in other parts of the United States, &s;ome of whom are indu&s;trious, and of a good moral character; and &s;ome of them appear to be truly pious, who are de&s;irous to remove to Africa, and &s;ettle there. They who are religious, would be glad to unite as Chri&s;tian brethren, and move to Africa, having one in&s;tructor, or more, and cultivate the land which they may obtain there, and maintain the practice of Chri&s;tianity in the &s;ight of their now heathen brethren; and endea|vour to in&s;truct and civilize them, and &s;pread the knowledge of the go&s;pel among them.</P>
<P>IN order to effect this in the be&s;t manner, a ve&s;|&s;el mu&s;t be procured, and proper &s;ailors provided, to go to Africa, with a number of per&s;ons, both white and black, perhaps, who &s;hall be thought equal to the bu&s;ine&s;s, to &s;earch that country, and find a place where a &s;ettlement may be made with the con&s;ent of the inhabitants there; the land be|ing
<PB REF="025631_0024_0FCE9EB3A6304A78">
given by them, or purcha&s;ed of them, and &s;o as be&s;t to an&s;wer the ends propo&s;ed. If &s;uch a place can be found, as no doubt it may, they mu&s;t return, and the blacks mu&s;t be collected who are willing to go and &s;ettle there, and form them&s;elves into a civil &s;ociety, by agreeing in a con&s;titution, and a code of laws, by which they will be regu|lated.</P>
<P>AND they mu&s;t be furni&s;hed with every thing nece&s;&s;ary and proper to tran&s;port and &s;ettle them there, in a &s;afe and comfortable manner; with &s;hipping and provi&s;ions, till they can procure them in Africa, by their own labour; and with in&s;tru|ments and uten&s;ils nece&s;&s;ary to cultivate the land, build hou&s;es, &amp;c. and have all the protection and a&s;&s;i&s;tance they will need, while &s;ettling, and when &s;ettled there. And, if nece&s;&s;ary, a number of white people mu&s;t go with them; one or more to &s;uperintend their affairs, and others to &s;urvey and lay out their lands&mdash;build mills and hou&s;es, &amp;c. But the&s;e mu&s;t not think of &s;ettling there for life; and the blacks are to be left to them&s;elves, when they &s;hall be able to conduct their own affairs, and need no farther a&s;&s;i&s;tance; and be left a free, inde|pendent people.</P>
<P>THIS appears to be the be&s;t and only plan to put the blacks among us in the mo&s;t agreeable &s;ituation for them&s;elves, and to render them mo&s;t u&s;eful to their brethren in Africa, by civilizing them, and teaching them how to cultivate their lands, and &s;preading the knowledge of the Chri&s;|tian religion among them. The whites are &s;o ha|bituated, by education and cu&s;tom, to look upon and treat the blacks as an inferior cla&s;s of beings, and they are &s;unk &s;o low by their &s;ituation, and the treatment they receive from us, that they ne|ver
<PB REF="025631_0025_0FCE9EB70B66D6A8">
can be rai&s;ed to an equality with the whites, and enjoy all the liberty and rights to which they have a ju&s;t claim; or have all the encouragements and motives to make improvements of every kind, which are de&s;irable. But if they were removed to Africa, this evil would cea&s;e, and they would enjoy all de&s;irable equality and liberty, and live in a climate which is peculiarly &s;uited to their con|&s;titution. And they would be under advantages to &s;et an example of indu&s;try, and the be&s;t man|ner of cultivating the land, of civil life, of morali|ty and religion, which would tend to gain the at|tention of the inhabitants of that country, and per&s;uade them to receive in&s;truction, and embrace the go&s;pel.</P>
<P>THESE United States are able to be at the ex|pence of pro&s;ecuting &s;uch a plan, of which the&s;e hints are &s;ome of the outlines. And is not this the be&s;t way that can be taken to compen&s;ate the blacks, both in America and Africa, for the in|juries they have received by the Slave-Trade and &s;lavery, and that which righteou&s;ne&s;s and benevo|lence mu&s;t dictate? And even &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s will be plea&s;ed with &s;uch a plan as this, and excite to exer|tions to carry it into effect, when the advantages of it to the public and to individuals are well con&s;ider|ed and realized. This will gradually draw off all the blacks in New-England, and even in the mid|dle and &s;outhern States, as fa&s;t as they can be &s;et free, by which this nation will be delivered from that which, in the view of every di&s;cerning man, is a great calamity, and incon&s;i&s;tent with the good of &s;ociety; and is now really a great injury to mo&s;t of the white inhabitants, e&s;pecially in the &s;outh|ern States.</P>
<P><PB REF="025631_0026_0FCE9EB889DBDD60">
AND by the increa&s;e and flouri&s;hing of &s;uch a plantation of free people in Africa, where all the tropical fruits and productions, and the articles which we fetch from the We&s;t-Indies, may be rai&s;ed in great abundance, by proper cultivation, and many other u&s;eful things procured, a com|merce may take place, and be maintained, between tho&s;e &s;ettlements and the United States of Ameri|ca, which will be of very great and increa&s;ing ad|vantage to both.</P>
<P>AND this will have the greate&s;t tendency wholly to aboli&s;h the abominable trade in human fle&s;h, and will certainly effect it, if all other attempts prove un&s;ucce&s;sful.</P>
<P>THAT &s;uch a plan is practicable, is evident from the experiment which has lately been made in forming a &s;ettlement of blacks at Sierra-Leona. Above a thou&s;and blacks were tran&s;ported from Nova-Scotia to that place la&s;t year&punc; who, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a &s;mall number of whites, and &s;up|plies from England, have formed a town and plant|ation, which by the late&s;t accounts is now in a flouri&s;hing condition, the inhabitants living in peace and amity with the neighbouring nations, and with a promi&s;ing pro&s;pect of being a great advantage to them, by teaching them to cultivate their lands, and civilizing them, and &s;hewing them the advantages of peace and of indu&s;try, and trade in the produc|tions of their country, and &s;preading the know|ledge of Chri&s;tianity among them. This will gra|dually put an end to the Slave-Trade and to &s;lavery in that part of the continent. And from this &s;et|tlement there is a rational pro&s;pect of a commerce, in the productions of that climate, with Britain, which will be &s;o profitable as more than to com|pen&s;ate
<PB REF="025631_0027_0FCE9EBA09EED4D8">
the latter for all the expence of forming and carrying it on, and will be greatly advantage|ous to both nations.</P>
<P>THERE is rea&s;on to believe that a &s;ettlement may be made by the blacks now in the United States in &s;ome part of Africa, either on the river Sierra-Leo|na, or in &s;ome other place, which will be as advan|tageous to tho&s;e who &s;hall &s;ettle there, and to the adjacent nations, as this which has been mention|ed, and with much le&s;s expence; and which will be a greater benefit to this nation, than that may be to Britain.</P>
<P>ARE there not, then, motives &s;ufficient to induce the Legi&s;lature of this nation to enter upon and pro&s;ecute this de&s;ign, to form a plan, and execute it, as wi&s;dom &s;hall direct? And is there not rea|&s;on to think that it would meet with general ap|probation? But if this cannot be, may not this be effected by the &s;ocieties in the&s;e States, who are formed with a de&s;ign to promote the be&s;t good of the Africans? Would not this be an&s;wering the end of their in&s;titution, in the be&s;t way that can be devi&s;ed, and in imitation of that which has been formed in Great-Britain, for the &s;ame purpo&s;e?</P>
<P>IS there not rea&s;on to believe, that, if &s;uch a plan was well dige&s;ted, and properly laid before the public, and urged, with the rea&s;ons which of|fer, and a company or committee formed to con|duct the affair, there might be a &s;um collected &s;uf|ficient to carry it into effect?</P>
