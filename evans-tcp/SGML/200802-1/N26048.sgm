<BIBL>1 THESSALONIANS, V. 17, 18.</BIBL>
<Q>PRAY WITHOUT CEASING&mdash;GIVE THANKS.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IN the words ju&s;t read, the in&s;pired apo&s;tle in|culcates on us the two important duties of prayer and thank&s;giving, which the Pre&s;ident of the United States invites us all to perform on this day. We have need to pray for the pardon of our &s;ins, as a <HI>nation,</HI> and as <HI>individuals,</HI> and to hum|ble our&s;elves profoundly before God on account of them; and we have need to pray for the continu|ation of the mercies, both &s;piritual and temporal, which we have hitherto enjoyed. To the procla|mation of our Supreme Magi&s;trate, our Right Rev. Bi&s;hop has been plea&s;ed to add his &s;trong recom|mendation, in which, in addition to the objects of humiliation and prayer common to all our fellow-citizens, he urges us to be&s;eech the Lord to put a &s;top to the dreadful per&s;ecution which is now ravaging his own church, and to comfort and &s;trengthen its vi&s;ible head. But, though the duty of humiliation and prayer be incumbent on us at all times, and <HI>more e&s;pecially at the pre&s;ent,</HI> &s;till, &s;eeing the a&s;toni&s;hing change that has lately taken place in the public mind, I con&s;ider the duty of thank&s;|giving as yet more pre&s;&s;ing&mdash;I &s;hall, therefore, at
<PB N="8" REF="034646_0006_0FFF455854CAF3C8">
this time, mention to you &s;ome of the motives which &s;hould excite us all to gratitude and thank&s;|giving to the great Be&s;tower of all good; and, as I proceed, I &s;hall, from time to time, make &s;uch re|flections as are proper to incline our hearts to prayer and humiliation.</P>
<P>DURING the whole cour&s;e of my mini&s;try among you, my brethren, I have never before entered into any details concerning political affairs; nor &s;hould I do it now, were it not to teach you to appreciate duly the government under which you live, and to point out your duties towards it.</P>
<P N="1">1. THE fir&s;t ble&s;&s;ing which demands our cordial thanks to God is, that we live under the free&s;t and mo&s;t ea&s;y government in the world. The con&s;titu|tion of the United States unites a proper degree of energy with all the liberty which any rea&s;onable per&s;on can de&s;ire. It is well-balanced, our execu|tive, legi&s;lative and judicial authorities being inde|pendent of, and mutually checked by, each other. They all emanate from the people at large; who have always the power to put an end to any real abu&s;es which may take place, by di&s;placing their pre&s;ent repre&s;entatives and appointing others that have their confidence&mdash;and as long as the great body of the people do not &s;ee the nece&s;&s;ity of a change of men and mea&s;ures, we may re&s;t a&s;&s;ured, that the abu&s;es, however they may be magnified by party-&s;cribblers and declaimers, are not of a very alarming nature. Under &s;uch a government as this, every in&s;urrection again&s;t the con&s;tituted au|thorities, or oppo&s;ition to them, is a revolt of a part again&s;t the general will, by which tho&s;e author|ities exi&s;t, and is highly criminal. Prai&s;ed be God, that this happy con&s;titution, under which per&s;ons of all denominations enjoy entire &s;ecurity for their lives, property, and liberty, whether &s;piritual or
<PB N="9" REF="034646_0007_0FFF4559E5026D20">
political, is &s;till unimpaired and in full operation; and that all the attempts to overturn, or to weak|en it, by concentrating all its powers in the &s;ingle hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives, have only &s;erved to throw light upon its principles, and to give it additional &s;trength.</P>
<P N="2">2. ANOTHER cau&s;e of thank&s;giving to God is, that the admini&s;tration of this mo&s;t excellent con|&s;titution, ever &s;ince its fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hment, has been committed to men eminent for their wi&s;dom, firm|ne&s;s, and patriotic &s;ervices. I need only mention a WASHINGTON, that guardian genius, that &s;aviour of his country, that ornament of the human race, to excite in all your hearts the warme&s;t feelings of e&s;teem, gratitude and love.&mdash;Long may he enjoy the charms of that retirement in which he has cho&s;en to &s;pend the evening of his life: may the ble&s;&s;ings of this country and of the univer&s;e be yet many years his reward; and at length, enriched with every chri&s;tian as well as moral virtue, may he enter the realms of everla&s;ting felicity.</P>
<P>WE have great rea&s;on to be thankful, that, when that approved warrior and admired &s;tate&s;man re|&s;igned the helm of &s;tate, and &s;ought the repo&s;e which his age and health required, God did not permit the intrigues of a foreign, in&s;idious nation to &s;ucceed in rai&s;ing the man of their choice to the pre&s;idential chair; but in&s;pired us with &s;ufficient courage to place at our head a &s;tate&s;man and pat|riot, who&s;e ability and integrity, proved in the mo&s;t trying times, eminently entitle him to our confidence and affection. Such is the illu&s;trious JOHN ADAMS, the pre&s;ent Pre&s;ident of the&s;e &s;tates. This great man can have nothing in view but the happine&s;s and pro&s;perity of his fellow-citizens, with who&s;e fortunes his own, and tho&s;e of his family, are evidently and in&s;eparably connected.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="034646_0008_0FFF455D81ED2230">
HE wi&s;hes for no power unwarranted by the con&s;titution, and for no &s;upport incompatible with the generous &s;pirit of freedom. Since the publica|tion of his in&s;tructions to our me&s;&s;engers of peace, we have learned, better than ever, to appreciate his worth. We are now a&s;&s;ured of his moderate and conciliatory temper, as well as of his deci&s;ive firm|ne&s;s. Under &s;uch a leader we have nothing to fear: never will he &s;acrifice the honor of his coun|try; never will he relinqui&s;h any part of that in|dependence which has long been the object of all his toils and labors, and for the obtaining of which &s;o many of our brave countrymen have &s;pilt their blood and lo&s;t their lives. Let us offer up our fer|vent prayers to Heaven, on this day, that his in|valuable life may be pre&s;erved, and his health con|tinued; that God would give him wi&s;dom to di&s;|cern what are the be&s;t mea&s;ures to be adopted for the good of his country, and the fortitude to put them into execution, in &s;pite of every ob&s;tacle and oppo&s;ition; and that all tho&s;e who a&s;&s;i&s;t him in council may be men of ability and integrity, &s;o that the public may receive no detriment from in|capacity or di&s;hone&s;ty. Let us all re&s;olve to give him a generous and cordial &s;upport, and openly avow this re&s;olution by &s;etting our names to the manly and &s;pirited addre&s;&s;es which are now pro|po&s;ed for the &s;ignature of all citizens. Let us tell him, that we feel, as we ought, the value of that liberty which we enjoy, and that we pledge our fortunes and &s;acred honour to defend it with loyal|ty and fidelity, under the banners of the govern|ment which we have cho&s;en. Let us expre&s;s our indignation at the repeated in&s;ults offered to this government, which has &s;ought peace by every po&s;&s;ible mean compatible with the dignity and honour of an independent nation. Let us declare,
<PB N="11" REF="034646_0009_0FFF455F069C8140">
with the firmne&s;s and &s;elf-re&s;pect of freemen, our readine&s;s to unite in every effort, which &s;hall be made, to prevent our being &s;ubjected to the de|grading conditions which a foreign nation &s;eeks to impo&s;e upon us, as preliminary to all negociation for peace, and that we con&s;ider war, with all its attendant calamities, as by far the lea&s;t of the two evils. Let us &s;how, that we love the government which protects us, and that we are not divided from it, either in intere&s;t or affection. In fine, let us expre&s;s our warm and unequivocal approbation of the wi&s;e and temperate &s;y&s;tem which has hitherto been pur&s;ued with regard to foreign nations, and our increa&s;ing confidence in him who pre&s;ides over us with &s;o much wi&s;dom and prudence.</P>
<P N="3">3. A THIRD motive, which we have, of the &s;incere&s;t thanks to Heaven is, that, while a &s;pirit of di&s;organization and di&s;order has produced &s;uch baleful effects in other countries, America, in &s;pite of the efferve&s;cence produced among us by the ex|traordinary exertions of foreign and dome&s;tic in|triguers, yet remains in a happy &s;tate of tranquilli|ty. France appears to have been rai&s;ed up by God for the cha&s;ti&s;ement of an impious world. I &s;peak not of France governed by the de&s;cendants of St. Louis; it was <HI>then</HI> the guardian of religion and good morals, and the a&s;ylum of the unfortunate. Happy land! where I received the mo&s;t valuable part of my education, and where I pa&s;&s;ed my hap|pie&s;t years among e&s;teemed friends and beloved a&s;&s;ociates! alas! to me no more! they are all either cruelly butchered, bani&s;hed, or reduced to wretch|edne&s;s at home. If I forget thee, O dear, charming abode, <HI>may my right hand forget her cunning; may my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth.</HI> But now, how changed! my heart &s;inks within me, my &s;pirits die away, when I recal the fate of &s;ome of
<PB N="12" REF="034646_0010_0FFF45608C3467A8">
my deare&s;t inmates. But &s;oon the painful recol|lection is &s;wallowed up in the con&s;ideration of the complicated di&s;tre&s;&s;es of that once highly favoured empire.</P>
<P>FRANCE revolutionized is more truly the &s;courge of God, than was ever Attila, or any other barbar|ous conqueror recorded in hi&s;tory. Its tyrants, like Satan, their father, may be literally &s;aid <HI>to go about, &s;eeking whom they may devour.</HI> If we ca&s;t an eye over the map of the world, we &s;hall find, in almo&s;t every part, mo&s;t dreadful traces of their de|&s;tructive plans. The mi&s;eries which they have &s;pread throughout the globe are beyond all the powers of calculation;&mdash;mi&s;eries &s;o univer&s;al as to have excited the horror of <HI>all</HI> who have the feel|ings, or merit the name, of human beings&mdash;mi&s;eries which will never be effaced from the memory of mankind, and which entire ages of peace and tran|quillity will be &s;carcely able to repair. What un|paralleled calamities have they not inflicted on their own wretched country! what wanton cruelties and atrocities have they not committed there! their own writers confe&s;s, that, by the different modes of de&s;truction, the guillotine, &s;hooting, drowning, and the like, upwards of 30,000 per&s;ons were kill|ed at Lyons, and that that once magnificent city was in great part levelled to the ground,&mdash;that, at Nantz, according to the lowe&s;t e&s;timate, 27,000 (&s;ome &s;ay, 40,000) were murdered, chiefly by drowning,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">THIS mode of putting people to death they bla&s;phemou&s;ly called the <HI>National Bapti&s;m.</HI></NOTE> &s;o that the water of the Loire, on which it &s;tands, became putrid, and was forbid|den to be drunk,&mdash;that at Paris, 150,000, and in la Vendee 300,000 were de&s;troyed. They own them&s;elves, that, &s;ince the beginning of their execra|ble revolution, two millions of their nation have
<PB N="13" REF="034646_0011_0FFF4562218CAB38">
been &s;acrificed, of which 250,000 were women, and 30,000 children: and in this immen&s;e carnage are not included the &s;oldiers who have peri&s;hed in camp and fallen in battle, nor the unborn infants who were de&s;troyed together with their mothers.&mdash;Look into that country, and examine its pre&s;ent &s;tate&mdash;Though, by plunder, forced loans, contribu|tions, and other iniquitous means, its lordly rulers have made a very great part of the riches of Europe to concentre there; &s;till, by their narrow policy, by the ruin of all manufactures, commerce, and every other regular &s;ource of wealth and revenue, and by the entire &s;ubver&s;ion of all public confidence, they have reduced the wretched inhabitants to a &s;tate little &s;hort of actual beggary and &s;tarvation. No &s;lavery can be equal to their's: their condition is the mo&s;t degraded that can be conceived. Every thing they po&s;&s;e&s;s, and even their very per&s;ons, are in a con&s;tant &s;tate of <HI>requi&s;ition;</HI> that is, they mu&s;t be given up at the call of their rapacious ma&s;ters, under pain of death, if they refu&s;e. No man there dares write, print, &s;peak, or even indicate, by the &s;malle&s;t &s;ign, any di&s;approbation of whatever mea&s;|ures may chance to be dictated by the faction actu|ally in power. Every pre&s;s is &s;eized that &s;ends forth the lea&s;t word in oppo&s;ition to the mandates of the haughty directors, and the editors are put to death, impri&s;oned or bani&s;hed. The people have no &s;table, fixed laws, by which to regulate their conduct: one edict is &s;carcely rendered public be|fore it is annulled by another directly contrary; &s;o that what is con&s;idered as lawful, and even <HI>pat|riotic,</HI> to-day, may to-morrow be accounted a crime worthy of death and confi&s;cation.</P>
<P>UNDER the&s;e accumulated calamities, the wretch|ed &s;laves might find their yoke le&s;s galling, their burdens le&s;s in&s;upportable, if they could enjoy, <HI>as it
<PB N="14" REF="034646_0012_0FFF4568E5019A30">
were by &s;tealth,</HI> the con&s;olations of religion, for which they hunger and thir&s;t. But no: their ty|rants have nearly dried up this &s;ource of comfort. And here, my friends, what horrid &s;cenes pre&s;ent them&s;elves to our recollection! Many years before the revolution bur&s;t forth, the &s;elf-&s;tyled philo&s;o|phers, a tribe compo&s;ed of dei&s;ts, athei&s;ts and materiali&s;ts, had, by their &s;ecret clubs, by impious and ob&s;cene publications, and by various other means, &s;ugge&s;ted by the infernal &s;pirit, attempted, and <HI>in part</HI> &s;ucceeded, to corrupt the different cla&s;&s;es of &s;ociety in France. But never could their &s;y&s;tem of impiety take effect upon the great ma&s;s of the cit|izens, who found, and ever will find, their happine&s;s in the belief of religion. They had long plotted the utter extirpation of all religion, but, in the fir&s;t place, of that which, by its greater exten&s;ion and &s;uperior attachment to order and good govern|ment, &s;tood more immediately in the way of their nefarious projects: this religion was the ROMAN CATHOLIC: its overthrow was, therefore, re&s;olved on; and the moment they had trampled down the ancient authorities of the kingdom, they employed every artifice, and made every effort, to effect their purpo&s;e. They began their impious attack on the church, by degrading her mini&s;ters in the eyes of the populace, by &s;tripping them of tho&s;e di&s;tinctive garments of their order, which, for ages, had rend|ered them re&s;pectable to the faithful. They then deprived them of their livings and other po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and repre&s;ented them as inimical to the true inter|e&s;ts of the country, becau&s;e they would not take oaths which tended to nothing le&s;s, than the renun|ciation of the authority of the &s;overeign pontiff and of the bi&s;hops; in a word, of the catholic re|ligion, which had been tran&s;mitted to them through &s;everal &s;ucceeding centuries. Upon their noble and

<HI>almo&s;t</HI> unanimous refu&s;al to apo&s;tatize from their faith, one of the mo&s;t horrible per&s;ecutions (and perhaps the mo&s;t &s;o), that was ever levelled again&s;t the mini&s;ters of the altar, commenced, and has con|tinued, with almo&s;t unabating fury, until the pre&s;|ent moment: according to the very la&s;t authentic accounts, the prie&s;ts are &s;till hunted down, and very great rewards are offered for delivering them up. Thou&s;ands of the&s;e holy men, of the&s;e gener|ous confe&s;&s;ors of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, have been put to death, by drowning, &s;hooting, and guillotining, or have peri&s;hed through want and ill treatment. Thou&s;ands and tens of thou&s;ands of them have been bani&s;hed from their homes, de&s;titute of all means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, by the bloody edicts of the mon&s;ters of France; or have gone into voluntary exile, and are now wandering in foreign climes, where they either &s;uffer all the horrors of indigence, or prolong their exi&s;tence by the precarious charities of &s;trangers. I need not inform you, my brethren, that the two excellent prie&s;ts, who govern this flock with &s;o much profit, and who are &s;o de&s;ervedly dear<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>THE Rev. Me&s;&s;rs. MATIGNON and CHEVRUS, who now &s;uper|intend the catholic congregation in Bo&s;ton.</P>
<P>WE can a&s;&s;ert with truth, &s;upported by the whole current of ec|cle&s;ia&s;tical hi&s;tory, that, in no age or country, have the clergy, as <HI>a body,</HI> ever conducted them&s;elves with &s;o much prudence, dignity and heroic firmne&s;s, as the gallican clergy have done, through a nine years in&s;idious, violent and bloody per&s;ecution.</P></NOTE> to you all, are here <HI>only</HI> in con&s;equence of the terrible vexations in their own country.</P>
<P>BUT the cruelty of the per&s;ecutors was not con|fined to the different orders of the clergy; it ex|tended even to the poor, innocent, defencele&s;s nuns, who, by almo&s;t entire exclu&s;ion from exterior con|ver&s;ation, and a con&s;ecration to the tranquil exer|ci&s;es of devotion, were become far more timid than the weake&s;t of their &s;ex who live in the world.
<PB N="16" REF="034646_0014_0FFF456C1F034908">
Bands of armed ru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ians were &s;ent into their &s;acred a&s;ylums, who u&s;ed every &s;pecies of violence to force them to take the &s;acrilegious oath to give up their religion. Many of tho&s;e unoffending virgins ex|pired under the murderous la&s;h, to pre&s;erve invio|late fidelity to their vows. Very few of them in|deed were terrified, or even &s;educed, into a com|pliance with the orders of their tyrants. At length, when all means of perver&s;ion had been e&s;&s;ayed in vain, a barbarous edict &s;trips them of all their prop|erty at one &s;troke; their convents are declared to be|long to the nation; and, in one day, all tho&s;e help|le&s;s victims, to the number of 30,000, are turned out by force to all the mi&s;eries attendant on a &s;tate of poverty and want. Many of them had grown old in the cloi&s;ter; many of them were &s;ick and infirm; all of them had given up, under the &s;anc|tion of former laws, whatever they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in the world, and of cour&s;e found them&s;elves in the ut|mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;s. No con&s;ideration of this kind was capable of touching the more than adamantine hearts of their enemies, who, to aggravate their wretched and forlorn &s;ituation, forbad all per&s;ons, under the &s;evere&s;t penalties, to harbour more than two of them together. All the eloquence that ever fell to the lot of a mortal would be totally in|adequate to point out, in their real turpitude, only a &s;mall part of tho&s;e deeds of horror which have taken place in France within the&s;e few years pa&s;t. The many traits of &s;avage barbarity related in the hi&s;tory of the world, all collected and united togeth|er, appear <HI>tender mercies,</HI> when compared with the refined cruelties of the &s;anguinary factions of that country; cruelties not committed by a few unli|cen&s;ed individuals, amid the di&s;orders of a revolu|tion, but by commi&s;&s;ion from the men in power, and under their immediate eye.

<P>To all their inhuman deeds, they have added the mo&s;t horrid impieties and profanations.

Some of the&s;e venerable temples they have turned into play-hou&s;es, &s;tores, rope-walks, &s;tables, and the like; and others they have devoted to the wor&s;hip of impious men and pro&s;tituted women, to whom they have paid the mo&s;t extravagant honours. They have re&s;pected nothing that has the lea&s;t relation to religion. They have commanded all bibles, prayer-books, &s;acred images, &amp;c. to be brought forth, and have con&s;umed them in one common ma&s;s. Nor, in this re&s;pect, has one religious pro|fe&s;&s;ion been more favoured than another; for the di&s;&s;enting meeting-hou&s;es, and even the Jewi&s;h &s;ynagogues, were emptied al&s;o, and their contents committed to the flames. They have &s;pared no one of the &s;acred in&s;titutions of Chri&s;tianity; and, in order to obliterate it entirely from the memory of mankind, they have made it a crime to pa&s;s the fir&s;t day of the week in exerci&s;es of religious wor|&s;hip (a practice co-eval with the exi&s;tence of the Chri&s;tian religion), and have introduced, in its &s;tead, the decade, a day wholly devoted to profane amu&s;ements.</P>

<P>THE Pope had been for ages, by the liberality of Chri&s;tian princes, a very con&s;iderable temporal &s;overeign. His dominions had been &s;ecured to him by the &s;ame &s;olemn treaties, which had hither|to bound kingdoms and &s;tates to each other.

Be&s;ides the motives for indigna|tion, which the generality of <HI>them</HI> have, again&s;t the vile mi&s;creants of France who wi&s;h to lord it over the world, you, as <HI>Catholics,</HI> have a motive yet more powerful; which is, that they have profaned and de&s;troyed your churches, barbarou&s;ly oppre&s;&s;ed, bani&s;hed, and murdered, your bi&s;hops, prie&s;ts, monks and nuns; and have carried their audacity &s;o far, as to lay their &s;acrilegious, polluted, hands on the Lord's anointed, the vi&s;ible head of the church, the common father of all the faithful.&mdash;May we, then, never again hear from the mouth of any Iri&s;h Catholic, that he rejoices at every vic|tory, and applauds every action, of the French, becau&s;e they are the enemies of his Engli&s;h oppre&s;|&s;ors.

Granting the reality of the oppre&s;&s;ion of which you complain, and that you have &s;uffered it all <HI>purely</HI> on account of your attachment to the catholic faith, which has been the glory of your nation from St. Patrick to the pre&s;ent day: yet what has this in common with the defence of the con&s;titution, the government and laws of united America?&mdash;This country has received you into her bo&s;om with the greate&s;t affection: &s;he makes you partakers of the &s;ame privileges and<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I SPEAK here of the federal government; for, in &s;everal of the &s;tates, as in Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, Roman Catholics are &s;ubjected to certain di&s;qualifications.</NOTE> immunities which her native &s;ons enjoy: &s;he takes under her protection your lives, property and religion. The mo&s;t of you are probably &s;ettled her for life: many of you have wives and children, to whom you are tenderly attached, and who&s;e welfare, as well as your own, is intimately connected with the welfare of the country. It is, therefore, evidently your in|tere&s;t, that America remain free and independent, in order that the ble&s;&s;ings of liberty and good gov|ernment may be tran&s;mitted to your po&s;terity. It would be the height of ba&s;ene&s;s and ingratitude not to join heart and hand in defending the land where you earn your bread, and enjoy all the happy ad|vantages which re&s;ult from &s;ocial life. England, which you deem your enemy and oppre&s;&s;or, it is true, is grappling with the nation which is now plundering and in&s;ulting us. It is not, for that rea&s;on, the cau&s;e of England that we are called to defend.&mdash;I know, that, to engage the ignorant and unwary on the &s;ide of France, it has been &s;aid by her parti&s;ans, that &s;he is defending the cau&s;e of all the oppre&s;&s;ed, throughout the world, again&s;t their tyrants, and the cau&s;e of republicani&s;m again&s;t mon|archy: but this language is too &s;tale to pa&s;s current,

at this time, even with the mo&s;t uninformed; e&s;|pecially &s;ince &s;he has &s;wallowed up all the republics of the old world.&mdash;France is the great oppre&s;&s;or of the univer&s;e; and, therefore, oppo&s;ition to her is ths <HI>common cau&s;e of the human race</HI> again&s;t their ty|rants, plunderers and murderers: it is the <HI>cau&s;e of every regular government, and of all civilized &s;ociety</HI> again&s;t di&s;organization, anarchy and terror: it is <HI>the cau&s;e of all religion and virtue</HI> again&s;t dei&s;m, athe|i&s;m and every &s;pecies of immorality: it is <HI>your</HI> cau&s;e; it is <HI>my</HI> cau&s;e; it is every <HI>hone&s;t</HI> man's cau&s;e: it is a cau&s;e, in which are deeply intere&s;ted our lives, our property, our liberty, our con&s;cience, our every thing that is dear to us for time and eternity.&mdash;Fly, then, to the &s;tandard of this country; and oppo&s;e, by every mean in your power, all the open or in|&s;idious attacks of the enemy. Cheerfully &s;ub&s;cribe your names to the addre&s;s of this town to the Pre&s;i|dent of the Union, in which an offer of life and for|tune is made to him for the efficient defence of the country. No neutrality, my brethren: "<HI>he that is not with me, is again&s;t me,</HI>" is as true with re&s;pect to the land that feeds you, as with re&s;pect to God him|&s;elf.&mdash;Avoid all tho&s;e men who &s;eek to inflame your pa&s;&s;ions again&s;t England, in order to range you on the &s;ide of France. Read none of tho&s;e &s;editious, lying, papers, in which our own rulers, the men of our choice, and all their mea&s;ures, are perpetually villified, calumniated, and mi&s;repre&s;ented, and in which every thing that is done by the French, how|ever ab&s;urd, incon&s;i&s;tent and infamous, is forever extolled, and held up as the model of perfection;&mdash;papers which, with <HI>truth</HI> and <HI>liberty</HI> for their motto, are always replete with <HI>fal&s;ehood</HI> and with the &s;enti|ments of <HI>&s;laves.</HI></P>
