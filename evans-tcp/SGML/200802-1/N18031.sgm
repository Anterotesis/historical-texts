<P>WE have numbered more than twenty-&s;even years &s;ince your oppo&s;ition to a foreign &s;y&s;tem of heavy oppre&s;&s;ion began. The year 1764 has been rendered memorable, on the one &s;ide by the folly and inju&s;tice of a hated &s;tamp-act, and, on the other, by the re|&s;i&s;ting energy of the patriot &s;ons of Freedom. From that period, the genius of American liberty, by com|bating di&s;tre&s;s, mi&s;ery, and ho&s;ts of enemies, waxed &s;trong in her own defence, and hath crowned more than THREE MILLIONS of mankind with national in|dependence.&mdash;In&s;tructed in the &s;chool of Freedom, the inhabitants of the&s;e confederate States combined their &s;trength in the protection of the rights of men. THEY KNEW AND THEY FELT THAT FREEMEN WILL BE FREE. By their exertions, under the favour of a righteous providence, they have e&s;tabli&s;hed a wi&s;e con&s;titution of federal government: they have reach|ed
<PB N="4" REF="023358_0004_0FBF3D6AA237EEF8">
the con&s;ummation of every patriot's wi&s;h, the glo|ry and felicity of their country; and now enjoy a free &s;y&s;tem of political happine&s;s, &s;uch as gives plea|&s;ure, and even tran&s;port, to the enlightened patriots of many nations; and has made, perhaps, no &s;mall advancement of joy among the benevolent ho&s;ts of Heaven: for, to every benevolent and virtuous be|ing, the freedom and happine&s;s of the human race is a mo&s;t plea&s;ing con&s;ideration.&mdash;But there are &s;ome men, with the means of public pro&s;perity in their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, who do not realize the value of Freedom: they partake of the common ble&s;&s;ings of a free peo|ple, and yet are not con&s;cious of national felicity.&mdash;This, however, does not le&s;&s;en the real worth of Lib|erty; for in every &s;ituation of life, it is the riche&s;t inheritance. In true Liberty is included, Freedom, both moral and civil; it has nothing in contempla|tion but the happine&s;s of mankind, and therefore it is the principal glory of man; and, in this world, there can be nothing more dignified, or more exalted. Without civil and religious Liberty, man is indeed a poor, en&s;laved, wretched, mi&s;erable creature; nei|ther his life, nor his property, nor the u&s;e of his con&s;cience, is &s;ecured to him; but he is &s;ubjected to &s;ome inhuman tyrant, who&s;e will is his law, and who <HI>pre&s;umes to govern men without their con&s;ent.</HI>&mdash;But let not this gale of hone&s;t zeal carry us beyond the re|collection of our text.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="023358_0005_0FBF3D7060F29200">
IN the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the text, it may be ob&s;erved, that the word LIBERTY, in this place, does princi|pally imply a freedom from the injunctions of the ceremonial law. This freedom our Saviour purcha&s;|ed for all Chri&s;tians; and in this freedom the apo&s;tle Paul exhorted the Galatians, and all the followers of Chri&s;t, to <HI>&s;tand fa&s;t.</HI> When we con&s;ider the age, and &s;tate of the world, in which the Jews lived, and their fondne&s;s of &s;how, idolatry, and &s;uper&s;tition, we &s;hall find that their religion was well &s;uited to their genius and temper. The religion of the Jews had a very pointed allu&s;ion to the character and office of the Me&s;&s;iah, and was therefore wi&s;ely enjoined. But tho&s;e typical and ritual &s;ervices, after the coming of Chri&s;t, having fulfilled their de&s;ign, became unne|ce&s;&s;ary. "The&s;e, &s;aid the apo&s;tle Paul, were a &s;hadow of things to come; but the body is of Chri&s;t, who hath aboli&s;hed the law of commandments contained in ordinances." Without the external pomp and &s;how of the Jewi&s;h religion, the go&s;pel recommends the wor&s;hip of God in &s;pirit and truth. The doctrines of the go&s;pel are calculated to promote good will and liberty among men; and where their genuine influence has been extended, mankind have been ren|dered more happy: they have been in&s;tructed, civil|ized, humanized, and made free. "The wi&s;dom that is from above is fir&s;t pure, then peaceable, gen|tle,
<PB N="6" REF="023358_0006_0FBF3D71C7E42828">
and ea&s;y to be entreated, full of mercy and good fruits, without partiality and without hypocri&s;y."&mdash;<HI>The true &s;pirit of the Go&s;pel contains the true &s;pirit of Liberty.</HI> We may be a&s;&s;ured, that under this benev|olent in&s;titution, u&s;eful liberty of every kind is rec|ommended by the &s;pirit of our text.</P>
<P>ALTHO my text, in the original meaning, did not re&s;pect civil &s;o much as religious liberty, yet I hope I &s;hall not &s;eem to mi&s;u&s;e it by making it the foun|dation of a di&s;cour&s;e on Liberty in general.</P>
<P>A FEW ob&s;ervations on the nature of religious Liberty, &s;hall con&s;titute the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> part of this di&s;|cour&s;e.</P>
<P>I. RELIGIOUS Liberty is a divine right, immediately derived from the Supreme Being, without the inter|vention of any created authority. It is the natural privilege of wor&s;hipping God in that manner which, according to the judgment of men, is mo&s;t agreeable and plea&s;ing to the divine character. As the con|&s;cience of man is the image and repre&s;entative of God in the human &s;oul; &s;o to him alone it is re|&s;pon&s;ible. In ju&s;tice, therefore, the feelings and &s;entiments of con&s;cience, and the moral practice of religion, mu&s;t be independent of all finite beings. Nor hath the all-wi&s;e Creator inve&s;ted any order of
<PB N="7" REF="023358_0007_0FBF3D73431B41F0">
men with the right of judging for their fellow-crea|tures in the great concerns of religion. Truth and religion are &s;ubjects of determination entru&s;ted to all men; and it is a privilege of all men to judge and determine for them&s;elves.</P>
<P>RELIGIOUS Liberty &s;ecures every man, both in his per&s;on and property, from &s;uffering on account of his peculiar &s;entiments in religion; and no practice which flows purely from this fountain of natural right can ju&s;tly be puni&s;hed. But when a man adopts &s;uch notions as, in their practice, counteract the peace and good order of &s;ociety, be then perverts and abu&s;|es the original Liberty of man; and were he to &s;uf|fer for thus di&s;turbing the peace of the community, and injuring his fellow-citizens, his puni&s;hment would be inflicted not for the exerci&s;e of a virtuous principle of con&s;cience, but for violating that uni|ver&s;al law of rectitude and benevolence which was intended to prevent one man from injuring another. To puni&s;h men for entertaining various religious &s;en|timents, is to a&s;&s;ume a power to puni&s;h them for do|ing what God gave them an unalienable right to do. For neither the principles of rea&s;on, nor the doctrines of the go&s;pel, which are the perfection of rea&s;on, have empowered any man to judge for him&s;elf and for another man al&s;o: this is religious tyranny; this
<PB N="8" REF="023358_0008_0FBF3D7BE3F48B48">
is to controul another man's con&s;cience: and to con|troul any man's con&s;cience is to contradict that true principle of eternal ju&s;tice which Je&s;us Chri&s;t pub|li&s;hed to the world: <HI>Therefore, all things what&s;oever ye would that men &s;hould do to you, do ye even &s;o to them.</HI></P>
<P>SUFFER me a little to illu&s;trate this maxim of primitive ju&s;tice. We will &s;uppo&s;e, that &s;ome man &s;hould endeavour to prove, that he had a right to determine what our religious principles and &s;enti|ments ought to be; but &iquest;how would he be plea&s;ed when his own arguments &s;hould be turned again&s;t him&s;elf? Should this man, who was unwilling to allow us the free exerci&s;e of rational, accountable creatures, be forced, in the change of human affairs, to re&s;ide among a people very different from him in matters of religion; he however behaving him&s;elf as an hone&s;t and peaceable man, and, as a good &s;ubject of civil &s;ociety, &s;erving the intere&s;t of the country; &iquest; would he not think it very unju&s;t and tyrannical to be per&s;ecuted for his religious opinions&mdash;impri&s;oned, deprived of his property, and finally condemned to die, only becau&s;e he could not with a clear con&s;cience wor&s;hip as they did? Only the Supreme Governour of mankind has a perfect right to receive the homage of the human mind; it is his peculiar prerogative to controul the con&s;ciences of men by his infinitely
<PB N="9" REF="023358_0009_0FBF3D7D0A072B50">
wi&s;e and equitable laws. True religion mu&s;t there|fore be founded in the inward per&s;ua&s;ion and con|viction of the mind; for without this it cannot be that <HI>rea&s;onable &s;ervice</HI> which is plea&s;ing to God. The human under&s;tanding cannot be convinced by exter|nal violence of any kind; nor can the immaterial &s;pirit be influenced by the laws of men, unle&s;s they corre&s;pond with the goodne&s;s, ju&s;tice, and mercy, of our ble&s;&s;ed Creator, our mo&s;t bountiful Benefactor, and our all wi&s;e and righteous Judge.&mdash;Here joy and gratitude prompt me to &s;ay, Oh happy people, who live in this land and in this age of religious Lib|erty! here every man has equally the freedom of choo&s;ing his religion; and may <HI>&s;it every man under his vine, and under his figtree; and,</HI> on the account of re|ligion, <HI>none &s;hall make them afraid.</HI> Let us, my friends and fellow-citizens, <HI>Stand fa&s;t, therefore, in the</HI> relig|ious <HI>Liberty wherewith</HI> God and <HI>Chri&s;t hath made us free.</HI></P>
<P>II. WITH &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the profe&s;&s;ional knowledge of my political Fathers, I will now venture to make &s;ome ob&s;ervations on the nature and principles of ci|vil Liberty. The&s;e ob&s;ervations &s;hall be included within the following particulars.</P>
<P N="1">1. IN this happy land of light and liberty, it is a truth fully e&s;tabli&s;hed, that all men are by nature
<PB N="10" REF="023358_0010_0FBF3D7F66A923F8">
equally free. From this principle of natural Liberty we derive an indefea&s;ible right of being governed by our own civil con&s;titutions. WE THE PEOPLE are the &s;ource of all legi&s;lative authority. Upon this ju&s;t, benevolent, plea&s;ing, and even delightful prin|ciple, the con&s;titutions, the laws, and the govern|ments, of the&s;e federal States, will <HI>&s;tand fa&s;t.</HI> All men who under&s;tand the nature, and feel the &s;pirit, of &s;uch principles, are &s;elf-in&s;tructed to be their own Legi&s;lators, either in one collected body, or by rep|re&s;entation. When all the people can a&s;&s;emble, and per&s;onally contribute their aid in framing con&s;titu|tions and laws for the government of them&s;elves, then their liberty is mo&s;t natural and mo&s;t perfect. But &s;ince great lo&s;s of time, much expen&s;e, and ma|ny inconveniences, would attend this mode of legi&s;|lation, the people have agreed, in free States, to &s;e|lect from the whole body, &s;ome of their brethren, whom they inve&s;t with legi&s;lative power. What &s;hall be tran&s;acted by the&s;e delegates or repre&s;entatives, con&s;i&s;tently with the con&s;titution of the people, mu&s;t be acknowledged as the act of the people. In con|formity to this plan, the people keep as near the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of natural Liberty, as is convenient and real|ly u&s;eful; and while they are truly virtuous, they will enjoy as much perfect Liberty as is nece&s;&s;ary to pre&s;erve peace, e&s;tabli&s;h ju&s;tice, and &s;ecure political
<PB N="11" REF="023358_0011_0FBF3D818A45F588">
happine&s;s.&mdash;I &s;hall only add further, under this particular, that when a free people have, according to their con&s;titution, determined to legi&s;late by rep|re&s;entatives, they &s;hould take great care that the rep|re&s;entation may be fully adequate to the importance and welfare of the people; the elections &s;hould al&s;o be perfectly free, and &s;ufficiently frequent.</P>
<P N="2">2. THE elections &s;hould be conducted agreeably to the principles of ju&s;tice and honour. The privi|lege of electing freely, or being freely elected, is one of the faire&s;t features in the pure image of natural Liberty. A free and unbia&s;&s;ed election of the be&s;t and the wi&s;e&s;t men, is a certain evidence of the flour|i&s;hing &s;tate of Liberty.&mdash;On the other hand, when elections are under di&s;hone&s;t influence, and men can be &s;old and bought, it is a mo&s;t lamentable &s;ign that Liberty is either in a deep &s;leep, or in a dangerous decay. When this <HI>birth-right</HI> of the people is bar|tered for &s;omething as mean as a me&s;s of <HI>pottage</HI>&mdash;when they neglect and de&s;pi&s;e this natural and con|&s;titutional right&mdash;they then lo&s;e their &s;hare and influ|ence in that government of which they were the orig|inal foundation. Having neglected that &s;ecurity which at fir&s;t exi&s;ted in them&s;elves, and having coun|teracted the very de&s;ign of that &s;ocial compact which was intended to &s;ecure them from every &s;pecies of political injury, they turn TRAITORS to their God
<PB N="12" REF="023358_0012_0FBF3D874E444C48">
who made them free; and for want of exerci&s;ing that natural power which their Creator gave them, their <HI>glory will depart:</HI> and, having the hearts of &s;laves, they will wear the livery and endure the mi&s;ery of &s;laves.&mdash;But I am not willing to &s;pend time in repre&s;enting this horrible image of &s;lavi&s;h mi&s;ery. This a&s;&s;embly is the image and repre&s;entation of a free &s;tate. I have the honour, I have the felicity, of &s;peaking before men who are too well acquainted with the ble&s;&s;ings of Liberty to neglect or de&s;pi&s;e any of the natural or con&s;titutional rights of freemen.</P>
<P N="3">3. THE public happine&s;s of a people is promot|ed, not only by the freedom of elections, but al&s;o by the wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s of the laws. A wi&s;e and a good repre&s;entation will produce good laws. Good and wi&s;e men, who are clothed with the natural power of their con&s;tituents, will &s;tudy to unite clo&s;e|ly the intere&s;t of the country and the power of the laws; and where the repre&s;entation is good, the laws will appear to carry with them the voice and common con&s;ent of the people. The laws made after this manner, are the laws of the people, and prove that they are free, and that they virtually legi&s;late for them&s;elves.&mdash;I leave this particular, after ob|&s;erving, that the public happine&s;s &s;hould be the fir&s;t duty and the prime object of all legi&s;lators; and that, in every free and virtuous &s;tate, this is the pole-&s;tar of legi&s;lation.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="13" REF="023358_0013_0FBF3D8847796FD8">
4. IT is the duty of the people, in conformity to the principles of Liberty, to choo&s;e men to &s;uperin|tend the executive department of the nation: for no man, in a free &s;tate, can ju&s;tly claim the authority of an executive magi&s;trate, without the voice and con&s;ent of the people. In the exerci&s;e of their own natural power, by their con&s;titution, they mu&s;t ap|point their chief magi&s;trate to this place of honour and tru&s;t. In this re&s;pect, it may be &s;aid, that the people do not only make their laws, but they al&s;o ex|ecute them, and govern them&s;elves. The&s;e con&s;ider|ations &s;hould have a tendency to di&s;courage all offi|cers of government from feeling them&s;elves inde|pendent of their brethren, THE PEOPLE. With the&s;e proper views, they will be more likely to pay that attention to the wants and feelings of the people, which is nece&s;&s;ary to increa&s;e the public happine&s;s. When, therefore, the mo&s;t exalted characters in au|thority feel them&s;elves connected to the whole com|munity by a brotherly, benevolent attachment; then the lives and the e&s;tates of the nation are mo&s;t &s;ecure. In addition to this, it may al&s;o be &s;aid, that the ad|mini&s;tration of men in power will then be the mo&s;t u&s;eful and honourable, when the affairs of govern|ment are conducted with moderation and ju&s;tice: for the people have not appointed men to in&s;ult and in|jure them, but to promote their be&s;t intere&s;t. Vio|lence
<PB N="14" REF="023358_0014_0FBF3D8A9A194640">
&amp; compul&s;ion will never advance the happine&s;s of freemen. They will know when they are govern|ed agreeably to their con&s;titutions and laws: they will know when they enjoy a portion of that civil pro&s;perity which they are entitled to by their rights and privileges: and they will ea&s;ily know when they are treated with civility and kindne&s;s. The people &s;hould have rea&s;on to believe, that men in office have nothing more at heart than the felicity of the nation.</P>
<P N="5">5. THE be&s;t mea&s;ures &s;hould be adopted to e&s;tab|li&s;h e&s;teem and confidence between the people and their rulers; for without this favourable impre&s;&s;ion, there will be but little peace and &s;atisfaction in the public mind. Great care &s;hould be taken not to di&s;|turb and irritate the temper of the people; their pa|tience &s;hould never be tortured; but they &s;hould have as many rea&s;ons to be plea&s;ed with the tran&s;ac|tions of government, as po&s;&s;ible, con&s;i&s;tent with the public welfare: for good humour and &s;atisfaction greatly contribute to the peace and happine&s;s of go|vernment and mankind. When the people have rea|&s;onable &s;atisfaction and re&s;t of mind, they will be more indu&s;trious, and con&s;equently more virtuous: the produce of the land will be more plentiful; and the &s;trength and re&s;ources of the nation will be in proportion to the plea&s;ure and encouragement of the mind. A free, willing, indu&s;trious, and virtuous
<PB N="15" REF="023358_0015_0FBF3D8CCA8705C8">
people, well united and well plea&s;ed, are the &s;trength of a nation; while the great wealth of a few lux|urious, idle drones, are the great bane of Liberty.&mdash;A people with that happy temper of mind which I have de&s;cribed, will be cheerfully obedient to their laws; they will re&s;pect and e&s;teem all their good civ|il officers; and peace and harmony will be plea&s;ant and la&s;ting.&mdash;The man, whom every benevolent, free and virtuous citizen re&s;pects and loves, &s;uffer me to adorn my humble page with the name of WASH|INGTON, hath declared, that, THE BEST WAY TO PRESERVE THE CONFIDENCE OF THE PEOPLE DURABLY IS TO PROMOTE THEIR TRUEST INTEREST.</P>
<P N="6">6. THE principles of a free people are directly oppo&s;ed to taxation without their own con&s;ent by rep|re&s;entation. Money &s;hould never be extorted by vi|olence, but received as the gifts and free will offer|ings, or contributions of the people, to pay for the &s;ecurity of their per&s;ons and property. Let them be convinced, that the public demands are rea&s;onable and nece&s;&s;ary, not merely for the benefit of civil offi|cers, but for the general advantage of the nation; and then as a free, enlightened, generous, virtuous people, they will take plea&s;ure cheerfully to defray the nece&s;&s;ary expen&s;es of government. They will be plea&s;ed when they recollect, that for a very &s;mall portion of their property they can be &s;ecured in the
<PB N="16" REF="023358_0016_0FBF3D944751AC28">
real po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all the ble&s;&s;ings of true Liberty.&mdash;But how will their plea&s;ure ri&s;e &s;till higher, when they con&s;ider, that by doing ju&s;tice to their brethren, to whom they have committed the toils and dangers of public bu&s;ine&s;s; when they con&s;ider, I &s;ay, that by their contributions they advance not only the great pro&s;perity of the nation, but include al&s;o their po&s;|terity in the general happine&s;s. But here let it be ob&s;erved, that no requi&s;itions &s;hould be made but &s;uch as are really and ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;upport and contingencies of government; and of the expenditure of money the people &s;hould have an account. Much the greater part of mankind toil &s;everely for what property they acquire: it would therefore be very unju&s;t and cruel to u&s;e it for the gratification of pampered pride and luxury. In a word, that government which improves the intere&s;t and happine&s;s of the people, and manages their pub|lic affairs con&s;i&s;tently with the principles of a gen|erous oeconomy, as well as a ju&s;t and <HI>magnanimous policy,</HI> free from a prodigal and di&s;hone&s;t wa&s;te of the public wealth; &s;uch a government will furni&s;h the mo&s;t rea&s;onable &s;atisfaction, and will be the mo&s;t va|lued and the mo&s;t bravely defended.</P>
<P>III. UNDER this head of di&s;cour&s;e, I will endeav|our to &s;hew when it may be &s;aid that a people <HI>&s;tand fa&s;t in the Liberty wherewith</HI> they are <HI>free.</HI> With the

THE people are in the habit and exerci&s;e of Liberty, when they re&s;ort to the fir&s;t principles of government, and trace their rights up to God the Creator: when they exerci&s;e their natural power of framing any &s;ocial compact conducive to the common intere&s;t: feel independent of all human power but that which flows from them&s;elves: di&s;dain the &s;ub|jection of their con&s;ciences to any authority but the will of God: refu&s;e to be controuled by the will of any man who claims an independent power of di&s;po&s;|ing of their lives and e&s;tates: recollect that they en|tered into &s;ociety to have their natural rights, which are the ba&s;is of civil rights, &s;ecured. To maintain &s;uch principles of original ju&s;tice, is to <HI>&s;tand fa&s;t</HI> in the righteous Liberty of man. True Liberty &s;uffers no man to be injured in his per&s;on, e&s;tate, or charac|ter: it encourages and enables him to improve hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> happine&s;s; and, within the limits of the public good, in&s;ures to him every ble&s;&s;ing to which imperfect hu|man nature can attain. All the toils, &s;ufferings, trea&s;ure and blood of men, are not lo&s;t, when they are the price and purcha&s;e of Liberty. Without re|ligious and civil Liberty, we can have no &s;ecurity of life, or of any of the good things of God: we can|not practice the &s;entiments of our con&s;ciences:&mdash;
<PB N="18" REF="023358_0018_0FBF3D97557CA7F8">
but where the rights of man are equally &s;ecured in the greate&s;t degree, there is the greate&s;t happine&s;s&mdash;AND THAT IS OUR COUNTRY.</P>
<P N="2">2. WHEN you carefully regard the election of your repre&s;entatives and officers of government, you will <HI>&s;tand fa&s;t</HI> in your Liberty. It is a darling priv|ilege of all freemen to elect the be&s;t qualified men to repre&s;ent them in a State or National A&s;&s;embly. But &iquest;do a people <HI>&s;tand fa&s;t</HI> in the di&s;charge of their duty&mdash;are they in the exerci&s;e of their civil rights, when they neglect to choo&s;e men of e&s;tabli&s;hed principles of Virtue and Liberty? &iquest; Do they wi&s;h to have good laws, and yet neglect to choo&s;e men who have proved them&s;elves friends to the rights of their bre|thren? &iquest;Can they rea&s;onably expect that good laws will proceed from men who <HI>fear not God nor regard man?</HI> &iquest; Will men, who feel no obligations of love and duty to their Creator, be good examples to their con&s;tituents? &iquest;Will they add any weight to the laws they a&s;&s;i&s;ted to make, when they are &s;o prompt to violate them? &iquest;Do they not, as far as their in|fluence will reach, defeat the very laws they voted for? &iquest;Will a public and patriotic &s;pirit originate from vicious principles? &iquest;Is it natural for noble and generous &s;entiments to flow from vice? &iquest;Do not bad principles make men &s;elfi&s;h, narrow the mind, and bani&s;h all benevolent propen&s;ities of doing
<PB N="19" REF="023358_0019_0FBF3D9F07627120">
good to men? &iquest;Will not the very knowledge which unprincipled men may have, degenerate into &s;elfi&s;h low cunning, and &s;erve only to embarra&s;s and perplex the hone&s;ty and good common &s;en&s;e of men who are able and willing to promote the intere&s;t of &s;ociety?&mdash;I need not tell you, that men under the influence of &s;elfi&s;h pa&s;&s;ions, will &s;acrifice the be&s;t intere&s;t of their country, whenever they can greatly advance their own importance; and, like a Dean and an Arnold, by the mo&s;t infamous and horrible trea&s;on, betray that Liberty which they once pretended to defend.&mdash;Do any of the people a&s;k me, as one of their bre|thren, &iquest; Who are the men we mu&s;t choo&s;e, in order to <HI>&s;tand fa&s;t</HI> in our Liberty? Fir&s;t, &s;eparate, in your minds, the mo&s;t wicked and unprincipled men, from being objects of your choice; and then, out of the re&s;t, &s;elect men of under&s;tanding, for of &s;uch there will enough remain, who are actuated by principles of love and obedience to God, and animated by a generous benevolence to mankind; who really love to &s;ee their brethren free and happy: for in this ev|ery benevolent man mu&s;t take plea&s;ure. Benevolent principles will produce the noble&s;t acts of public and patriotic good; they will enable men to di&s;cern ea&s;ily the advantage of the people. "For when private intere&s;t and private views are removed, it will be ea&s;y to know what is the public good."&mdash;Let me be&s;eech
<PB N="20" REF="023358_0020_0FBF3DA0479FD3F8">
all the people to remember, that their &s;afety and hap|pine&s;s in &s;ociety depends upon the election of good and wi&s;e repre&s;entatives. Under the &s;miles of pro|vidence, the pro&s;perity of a free people is in their own hands; for they have knowledge enough, if well improved, to advance and &s;ecure their welfare. In a few words, choo&s;e the men to manage your pub|lic affairs, to whom you would not fear to entru&s;t the mo&s;t important concerns of a private nature.&mdash;This is the way to <HI>&s;tand fa&s;t</HI> in your Liberty.</P>
<P N="3">3. THE example of civil officers has great influ|ence on the minds of mankind. They ought to be punctual in their ob&s;ervation of the laws of the coun|try. As public men, or private citizens, they &s;hould be uniform in the practice of virtue, and the defence of Liberty. The people call them FATHERS: we are willing to be their political children, as long as they are good parents. But, &iquest; Should not fathers be examples of goodne&s;s to their children? &iquest;Will children do well, if the parents are wicked and do wrong? &iquest;Will the children be obedient to the pub|lic laws, if the parents violate them? &iquest;Will the children love Freedom, if the parents di&s;regard it? &iquest;Will the children cultivate a public &s;pirit, if the parents are &s;elfi&s;h? &iquest;Do fathers love their children, and not &s;trive in all re&s;pects to promote their felicity? It is mo&s;t rea&s;onable, therefore, to conclude, that it
<PB N="21" REF="023358_0021_0FBF3DA1CC4DA0B0">
is the great and indi&s;pen&s;ible duty of rulers to encour|age the practice of religion by their own influence and example: and I venture to declare, that no civil officer does the half of his duty, unle&s;s he endeavours to &s;uppre&s;s vice and di&s;order, and &s;o prevent the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of puni&s;hment. Mankind very quickly and ju&s;tly exclaim again&s;t the ab&s;urdity of allowing tho&s;e men to be teachers of religion, who live in the habit|ual practice of vice and wickedne&s;s: &iquest;Shall we not, with equal ju&s;tice, condemn the practice of tho&s;e men who break through tho&s;e re&s;traints which were intended to &s;uppre&s;s vice, and con&s;equently encourage virtue? &iquest;Should they not be <HI>mini&s;ters of God for good</HI> to the people, in every po&s;&s;ible way? Every man of common &s;en&s;e acknowledges, that religion is very u&s;eful to mankind; and e&s;pecially the precepts and truths of the go&s;pel. It is al&s;o allowed, that public wor&s;hip is of particular and national advantage. To favour and practice virtue is therefore to increa&s;e the public happine&s;s, and to an&s;wer the intention of gov|ernment: and by the&s;e means their own importance and authority will be increa&s;ed.</P>
<P N="4">4. WHEN the people are &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive to their laws and rulers, upon the principles already mentioned, their Liberties will be permanent. Where the true &s;pirit of religion is united to the free and generous &s;pirit of Liberty, obedience will be a plea&s;ing duty.
<PB N="22" REF="023358_0022_0FBF3DA8751A6028">
The author of our benevolent religion hath com|manded us to <HI>render unto Coe&s;ar the things which are Coe&s;ar's; and unto God, the things that are God's.</HI> The apo&s;tles al&s;o &s;ay, <HI>Submit your&s;elves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's &s;ake.

<P N="5">5. THE Liberties of a people cannot be la&s;ting without knowledge. The human mind is capable of great cultivation. Knowledge is not only u&s;eful, but it adds dignity to man. When the minds of men are improved, they can better under&s;tand their rights&mdash;they can know what part they are to act, in con|tributing to the welfare of the nation. Freemen &s;hould always acquire knowledge; this is a privilege and plea&s;ure unknown to &s;laves; this elevates the
<PB N="23" REF="023358_0023_0FBF3DAB57600A10">
mind of; man; this creates a con&s;cious dignity of his importance as a rational creature, and a free agent. The happine&s;s of mankind has been much advanced by the arts and &s;ciences; and they have flouri&s;hed the mo&s;t among freemen. Slavery blots the image of the Creator, which was at fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ed upon man: it bani&s;hes knowledge, and courts mi&s;ery. But men, enlightened, pur&s;ue with ardour the knowledge and recovery of their rights. Liberty is enlightened by knowledge; and knowledge is nurtured by Liberty. Where there is wi&s;dom, virtue, and Liberty, there mankind are MEN&mdash;In all the dark ages of the world, tyranny has been e&s;tabli&s;hed upon the &s;lavi&s;h igno|rance of mankind. Tyrants, in time pa&s;t, &s;ecured their domination by darkening the minds of their &s;ubjects. In the pre&s;ent day, they tremble at the approaching light of knowledge and Liberty. They turn indignant from the glorious illuminations of America and France. They hear with horrour the &s;ound of Freedom and the rights of men. They would &s;till imbrute the human race, and make man|kind forget that they are men:&mdash;Be a&s;&s;ured, my dear countrymen, knowledge is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to &s;e|cure the ble&s;&s;ings of Freedom. If you wi&s;h to &s;ee your country not only free in your day, but al&s;o to fea&s;t your imaginations with the plea&s;ing pro&s;pect of a free po&s;terity for many ages to come; let me en|treat
<PB N="24" REF="023358_0024_0FBF3DAC483FA9F0">
treat you, to encourage and promote that knowledge which will enable the people &s;ucce&s;sfully to watch all the enemies of Liberty, and guard again&s;t the de&s;igns of intriguing men. Unle&s;s the people have knowl|edge, they may be impo&s;ed upon by men who are always lying in wait to di&s;turb the peace of &s;ociety, create di&s;order and confu&s;ion, and, in the tumult, overturn the Liberties of the country. Be always awake to your own intere&s;t, and you will have noth|ing to fear: but if you &s;leep, the enemies of Liber|ty will awake:&mdash;&s;leep, and by your death-like &s;lum|bers you will give them life: for Liberty has never yet appeared upon the face of the earth without meeting enemies to contend with.&mdash;There have been men in America, who have reprobated what they were plea&s;ed to call the inqui&s;itive &s;aucine&s;s of the people, when they wi&s;hed to know how the public affairs of the country were conducted, and how Ju&s;tice and Liberty might be &s;ecured. Nay, &s;ome men, &s;till more unju&s;t and tyrannical, have ventured to &s;ay&mdash;blu&s;h! ye degenerate &s;ons of free parents!&mdash;that the people, when in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Liberty, are unable to u&s;e it for their own advantage, and therefore they ought to be governed again&s;t their wills, and without their choice, by men, to be &s;ure, much wi&s;er than them&s;elves, and more di&s;po&s;ed to do them good. This is as much as to &s;ay, that the people ought to be
<PB N="25" REF="023358_0025_0FBF3DB028B25D90">
robbed of their natural rights for their own advantage and happine&s;s. But whoever is acquainted with the hi&s;tory of de&s;potic power, need not be informed, that a free people will always u&s;e their Freedom more con|&s;i&s;tently with the principles of ju&s;tice and rea&s;on, than any men with uncontrouled power. It is a truth, and it is now too late to deny it, that no man, or body of men, are &s;it to be entru&s;ted with unlimit|ted power. This power they would mo&s;t certainly abu&s;e, whenever their unju&s;t wills were in the lea&s;t oppo&s;ed. Let the youth be well educated in wi&s;dom and virtue; let them be in&s;tructed in the true princi|ples of Freedom, and they will improve their Liber|ty mo&s;t agreeably to the rational happine&s;s of man|kind. In this free country, knowledge is peculiarly nece&s;&s;ary, where no other qualifications are requi&s;ite, for the mo&s;t important offices of government, but virtue and ability. I again &s;ay, let the children and youth be well educated. In the earlie&s;t &s;tages of life, let a free and public &s;pirit be infu&s;ed into the youth|ful mind. This is the way to exclude from their young brea&s;ts all oppre&s;&s;ing and cruel pa&s;&s;ions.&mdash;Unle&s;s the doors of education are open to all the youth of the country equally, advantages may be taken by &s;ome men of cunning, to tyrannize over the re&s;t, and become ma&s;ters of their property.

We remember no aera &s;ince the creation of the world, &s;o favourable to the rights of mankind as the pre&s;ent. The hi&s;tories of mankind, with only a few exceptions, are the records of human guilt, oppre&s;&s;ion, and mi&s;ery. Although &s;ome &s;hadow of rude Liberty was contended for by a few &s;mall uncivilized tribes of men, yet they were &s;ubjected by tho&s;e nations who were more powerful. At the beginning of the Chri&s;tian aera, almo&s;t two thirds of mankind were in the mo&s;t abject and cruel &s;lavery. The Grecian and Roman nations, notwith|&s;tanding their boa&s;ted love of Liberty, were not ac|quainted with the true principles of original, equal, and &s;entimental Liberty. Though an imperfect civ|ilization had made &s;ome progre&s;s among them, yet they neither under&s;tood the nature, nor practi&s;ed the duties, of humanity.

I ONCE more invite you to join me in gratitude to that be&s;t of Beings, by who&s;e providential goodne&s;s and power <HI>the lines are fallen unto us in plea&s;ant places; yea,</HI> we <HI>have a goodly heritage.</HI> Here harve&s;ts grow for the free and cheerful hu&s;bandman: here, neither awed by lordly and rapacious inju&s;tice, nor dejected by beholding idlene&s;s high fed and fattened on the labours of other men, they reap and enjoy the plea&s;|ing fruits of their hone&s;t indu&s;try. <HI>Ye &s;hall eat your bread to the full, and dwell in your land of &s;afety.</HI> Here the people dwell together as brethren; peace, har|mony, indu&s;try, and health, unite their various gifts to make this life a ble&s;&s;ing: here poor human nature, in other parts of the world long depre&s;&s;ed by igno|rance and en&s;laving power, &s;eems to reclaim the primitive ble&s;&s;ings of creation, and to rejoice that it was made <HI>in the image of</HI> GOD: here con&s;cience a&s;|&s;umes her fir&s;t authority; religion is no longer en|&s;laved to the wills and laws of men; public and pri|vate happine&s;s are guarded by the laws and govern|ment of the people.&mdash;<HI>Stand fa&s;t, therefore, in the Lib|erty wherewith Chri&s;t hath made us free, and be not en|tangled again with the yoke of bondage.</HI> Let us determine to be free from the unju&s;t power of men, and free from the &s;lavery and tyranny of &s;in, and we &s;hall then be truly free. <HI>If the Son, therefore, &s;hall make you free, ye &s;hall be free indeed.</HI></P>

WITH the words of a celebrated French writer, this di&s;cour&s;e will be concluded.</P>
<P>"YE people of Northamerica, let the example of all nations who have gone before you, and above all that of Greatbritain, &s;erve you for in&s;truction. Fear the affluence of gold, which brings with luxury the corruption of manners, the contempt of laws. Fear a too unequal di&s;tribution of riches, which exhibits a &s;mall number of citizens in opulence, and a great multitude of citizens in extreme poverty; whence &s;prings the in&s;olence of the former, and the deba&s;e|ment of the latter. Secure your&s;elves again&s;t the &s;pirit of conque&s;t. The tranquillity of an empire dimin|i&s;hes in proportion to its exten&s;ion. Have arms for your defence; have none for offence. Seek compe|tency and health in labour; pro&s;perity in the culture of lands, and the work&s;hops of indu&s;try; power in manners and virtue. Cau&s;e arts and &s;ciences, which di&s;tingui&s;h the civilized from a &s;avage man, to flouri&s;h and abound. Above all, watch carefully over the education of your children. It is from public &s;chools, be a&s;&s;ured, that come the wi&s;e magi&s;trates, the capa|ble and courageous &s;oldiers, the good fathers, the good hu&s;bands, the good brothers, the good friends, the good men. Wherever the youth are &s;een de|praved, the nation is on the decline. Let Liberty have an immoveable foundation in the wi&s;dom of
<PB N="35" REF="023358_0035_0FBF3DD56FFE9B18">
your laws, and let it be the inde&s;tructible cement to bind your States together. E&s;tabli&s;h no legal pre|ference among&s;t the different forms of wor&s;hip. Su|per&s;tition is innocent, wherever it is neither per&s;ecut|ed nor protected; and may your duration, if it be po&s;&s;ible, equal the duration of the world!</P>
