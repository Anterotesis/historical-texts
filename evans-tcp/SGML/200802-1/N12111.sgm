</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE words cho&s;en as the theme of the en&s;uing di&s;|cour&s;e, come recommended to us at this day of tribulation, as the direction given to the &s;uffering Jews, to &s;upport their minds under the terror and troubles of per&s;ecutors, while they &s;uffered for righteou&s;ne&s;s &s;ake: But their pertinence in this day of war, may appear from their connexion with the &s;cripture hi&s;tory which gives occa&s;ion to them; which therefore I beg leave to narrate; not, my hearers, becau&s;e you are ignorant of it, but becau&s;e a fre&s;h remembrance of it gives me an ad|vantage in laying out my plan.</P>
<P>AHAZ, at the time of this prophecy, was king of Judah, as Pekah, &s;on of Remaliah, was of I&s;rael; the capital of who&s;e kingdom was Samaria. Upon the throne of Syria was Rezin, who&s;e metropolis was Da|ma&s;cus. There was al&s;o A&s;&s;yria upon the river Eu|phrates, with a powerful monarch then on the throne.</P>
<P>REZIN and Pekah entered into a confederacy, again&s;t the king of Judah, to dethrone him, and &s;et up in his room the &s;on of Tabeal. The news of this confedera|cy occa&s;ioned great fear to the hou&s;e of David. The LORD therefore ordered the prophet I&s;aiah to go forth
<PB N="6" REF="015285_0005_0F9882AA3B8F6408">
with his &s;on Shear-Ja&s;hab, (who&s;e name &s;ignified a remnant &s;hall return) to meet Ahaz, and &s;ay to him,
<Q>take heed and be quiet; fear not, neither be faint hearted;</Q>
and to a&s;&s;ure him, that the evil coun&s;el which Syria and Samaria had taken again&s;t him, &s;hould not come to pa&s;s; but that within three &s;core and five years, Ephraim, i. e. Samaria &s;hould be broken, that it &s;hould not be a people.&mdash;However, their belief of this was required, as a condition of fulfilment,
<Q>if ye will not believe, &s;urely ye &s;hall not be e&s;tabli&s;hed.</Q>
The LORD moreover commanded Ahaz to a&s;k a &s;ign; but he, accounting this a tempting the LORD, refu&s;ed. GOD, after rebuking him, gave this &s;ign,
<Q>Behold a virgin &s;hall conceive and bear a &s;on, and &s;hall call his name Immanuel &mdash;For before the child &s;hall know to refu&s;e the evil and chu&s;e the good, the land that thou abhore&s;t &s;hall be for&s;aken of both her kings.</Q>
That is the child Shear-Ja&s;hub, &s;ays Mr. Henry.</P>
<P>"MOREOVER, the LORD" commanded the prophet to
<Q>take a great roll, and write in it with a man's pen, concerning Mahar-&s;halal-ha&s;h-baz,</Q>
perhaps to enrol his name as one promi&s;ed by GOD to him: where|upon
<Q>he went in unto the prophete&s;s, i. e. his wife, and &s;he conceived and bear a &s;on,</Q>
and the LORD commanded him to "call his name Mahar|&s;halal-ha&s;h-baz," i. e. make &s;peed to the &s;poil, or ha&s;ten to the prey. Whence the prophet &s;ays,
<Q>Behold, I and the children whom the LORD hath given me, are for &s;igns and for wonders in I&s;rael.</Q>
This promi&s;e is al&s;o added,
<Q>For before the child &s;hall have know|ledge to cry, My father and my mother, the riches of Dama&s;cus, and the &s;poil of Samaria &s;hall be taken away before the king of A&s;&s;yria.</Q>
It is worthy of notice, that &s;ome in the kingdom of Judah, which was the mo&s;t righteous and equitable government then on earth, were unea&s;y under it, and de&s;irous of being under
<PB N="7" REF="015285_0006_0F9882AB0074F950">
Rezin and Pekah, which is elegantly expre&s;&s;ed,
<Q>For as much as this people refu&s;eth the waters of Shiloah that go &s;oftly, and rejoice in Rezin and Remaliah's &s;on,</Q> &amp;c. whence, it is evidently no uncommon thing, for per&s;ons to be unea&s;y, under the mo&s;t mild and righteous government, which the GOD of heaven hath e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>
<P>WHEN the king of Judah, and his nobles heard of this league between Rezin and Remaliah's &s;on, they were all &s;o fa&s;t, for entering into a confederacy with &s;ome power to a&s;&s;i&s;t them, which was di&s;agreable to to the LORD of ho&s;ts; for he would have his people have their dependence upon him, and look to him for &s;alvation. The prophet was therefore in&s;tructed of GOD, to divert them from a confederacy. He therefore repre&s;ents the alliance of Syria and Samaria, and the futility of their league, v. 9, 10, and lays before them the in&s;truction GOD gave him re&s;pecting that affair;
<Q>For the LORD &s;pake thus to me with a &s;trong hand, and in&s;tructed me that I &s;hould not walk in the way of this people, &s;aying, Say ye not A con|federacy to all them to whom this people &s;hall &s;ay, A confederacy; neither fear ye their fear, nor be afraid.</Q>
GOD impre&s;&s;ed his mind fully&mdash;made him &s;trong again&s;t the prejudices of the people who at that day, &s;eemed to think of no other way of deliverance, but by confront|ing force with force. The way of that people which GOD would not have him walk in, was al&s;o a &s;inful fear, to the neglect of a religious dependance upon GOD's almighty arm for &s;alvation. They neglected repent|ance and reformation, and were about to guard them|&s;elves again&s;t di&s;tre&s;&s;ing fear, by a confederacy. Our text points out to us the will of GOD at &s;uch a time. "Sanctify the LORD OF HOSTS him&s;elf," &amp;c.</P>
<P>IN a time of eminent danger, when multitudes com|bine again&s;t the people of GOD, in&s;tead of mitigating
<PB N="8" REF="015285_0007_0F9882ABC16256F0">
their fear by a confederacy, it is their duty and intere&s;t to &s;anctify the LORD of ho&s;ts him&s;elf, and make him their fear, and dread. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The preacher means to handle the &s;ubject theologically, not politically, and thinks it proper to enter this caveat, le&s;t any might &s;u&s;pect an innuendo from his u&s;e of the word confederacy.</NOTE></P>
<P>THIS &s;ubject may naturally be con&s;idered in two parts.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. To &s;how wherein this &s;anctification of the LORD of Ho&s;ts con&s;i&s;ts.</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. THAT it is the duty and intere&s;t of GOD's people, thus to &s;anctify him in &s;uch a time of danger.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>AS it was the di&s;tre&s;&s;ing fear of an inva&s;ion, that occa&s;ioned this direction, which GOD would cure by turning this pa&s;&s;ion to its true object: &s;uffer me to re|mark a word upon it in this place.</P>
<P>FEAR is of all pa&s;&s;ions in man the mo&s;t frantic, and lea&s;t under the government of rea&s;on, and yet of all pa&s;|&s;ions the mo&s;t natural and deeply rooted in &s;en&s;itive nature; therefore, common to man with all other crea|tures, which have any con&s;iderable degree of &s;en&s;e; crea|tures which &s;carce betray any other pa&s;&s;ion, evidence the force of this, in flying danger. While the object of fear, whether real or imaginary, is &s;trongly painted on the imagination in all the horror of dreadfuls, all the rea&s;oning of men can't allay it. You may as well at|tempt to rea&s;on a dead man to life, as to conjure down fear by rea&s;on. There is no cure for it in nature, but this in our text, (nam.) placing before the mind an ob|ject more fearful, yet an object of tru&s;t; &s;o turning men from a &s;inful to a religious fear. This is the way GOD takes to bring all undue pa&s;&s;ions in fallen nature to regularity, by placing them upon their genuine ob|jects, where there is no danger of exce&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="015285_0008_0F9882AC811BC0A0">PASS now to &s;hew wherein this &s;anctification of the LORD of ho&s;ts con&s;i&s;ts; where, for brevity &s;ake, it may be remembered, that the word &s;anctification conveys different ideas, according to the agent acting, or the ob|ject towards which it is acted. When GOD is the agent, and inanimate matter the object &s;anctified, it is &s;etting a part any thing from common to holy u&s;es. When GOD is the agent, and rational yet fallen man the object, it is the renewing &s;uch "after the image of him that created him." When man is the agent, and GOD the object, as in our pre&s;ent di&s;cour&s;e; it is the acting forth, holy di&s;po&s;itions and affections of renewed nature &s;uitably, towards the various perfections of DEITY; and &s;ince religious fear with reverence is due in regard to all his perfections, attributes and manife&s;tations, the whole of religion is &s;ummed up in the fear of the LORD. Sancti|fying the LORD of HOSTS, and letting him be our fear and our dread, are but &s;ynonimous, though explanative terms. This &s;anctification of the LORD of HOSTS con|&s;i&s;ts in a belief of the being of GOD; this is the great foundation of natural religion, without which there can be no true religion. "For he that cometh to GOD mu&s;t believe that he is." To pretend &s;anctity, or la|bour to e&s;tabli&s;h vital piety, go&s;pel holine&s;s in men's hearts, without this foundation principle, is as ab&s;urd as to pretend to lay the top &s;tone in the air before the foundation is laid on the ground. When St. Paul went to go&s;pelize the Romans, then an heathen nation, he fir&s;t laboured to e&s;tabli&s;h this foundation principle, &s;hewing them, that their idolatrous practices &s;tood in the face of natural religion. "For the invi&s;ible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly &s;een, being under&s;tood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead, &amp;c." The &s;ame weapon did he u&s;e, to ca&s;t down Athenian &s;uper&s;tition, which he had evidence of from the "altar, with this in&s;cripti|on,
<PB N="10" REF="015285_0009_0F9882AD3B95D478">
TO THE UNKNOWN GOD, whom there|fore ye ignorantly wor&s;hip, him declare I unto you." And this was but following GOD's own method of deal|ing with I&s;rael, when they had been hundreds of years in &s;ight of Egyptian idolatry. To e&s;tabli&s;h them in a belief of his being, and &s;upreme power over all pretend|ed gods, were directed the miracles of Mo&s;es before Pharaoh&mdash;their deliverance at the red &s;ea&mdash;the pillar of "the cloud by day," and "the pillar of fire by night," the daily &s;upply of manna, and the pre&s;ervation of their cloathing upon them. To this end, after di&s;ciplining them by the greate&s;t General of that, or perhaps of any other age, he led them on to battle, and victory, (Mo&s;es praying to I&s;rael's GOD) and afterward in an&s;wer to Jo&s;hua's reque&s;t, made the "&s;un &s;tand &s;till upon Gi|beon, and" the "moon in the valley of Aijalon," to convince them that he was the author of nature, and LORD of the ho&s;ts of Heaven. This, after the purpo&s;es of heaven were accompli&s;hed upon that unbelieving generation, laid the foundation for that eminent piety, which was the glory of that nation; and was ever after remembered by GOD with complacency. "I remem|ber thee the love of thine e&s;pou&s;als, when thou wente&s;t after me in the wilderne&s;s."</P>
<P>IN a &s;teadfa&s;t belief that he is the LORD of HOST, that all ho&s;ts of angels, men, animals, in&s;ects, yea and devils, are under his &s;upreme command and &s;ovran controul. To e&s;tabli&s;h this foundation principle&mdash;this mo&s;t effec|tual guard again&s;t idolatry, did the GOD of heaven work a miracle, and con&s;trained the proud monarch of Babylon to acknowledge, that his "dominion is an everla&s;ting dominion, and his kingdom is from gene|ration to generation. And all the inhabitants of the earth are reputed as nothing: and he doth according to his will in the army of heaven, and among the in|habitants
<PB N="11" REF="015285_0010_0F9882ADFB01FCD0">
of the earth: and none can &s;tay his hand, or &s;ay unto him, what do&s;t thou?" This truth, fully be|lieved, &s;hews us, that angels, or men, or animals, or in|&s;ects, or the ho&s;ts of heaven, or the elements, mu&s;t act according to his command; either as in&s;truments of vengeance to correct a back&s;liding people, or as mini&s;|ters of &s;alvation to his cho&s;en ones. "Fire and hail, &s;now and vapour," with "&s;tormy wind fulfilling his word." Angels as mini&s;tering &s;pirits, mini&s;tring to them who &s;hall be the heirs of glory, or mini&s;ters of vengeance, to his people's adver&s;aries&mdash;the &s;tars in their cour&s;e to fight again&s;t whom he plea&s;es. In con&s;equence of this &s;ovran authority, he has an uncontroubled in|fluence over the minds of men; either to in&s;pire them with greatne&s;s of &s;oul, to perform the &s;ervices to which he calls them, in his providence, as upon Saul's promo|tion to royalty "GOD gave him another heart," or to deprive the wi&s;e&s;t coun&s;ellors of their wi&s;dom. "He leadeth coun&s;ellors away &s;poiled, and maketh the judges fools&mdash;he loo&s;eth the bands of kings, and girdeth their loins with a girdle. He leadeth princes away &s;poiled, and overthroweth the mighty. He removeth away the &s;peech of the tru&s;ty, and taketh away the under&s;tanding of the aged. He poureth contempt upon princes, and weakeneth the &s;trength of the mighty." It is common with GOD, to &s;uffer a &s;pirit of deception to come upon the coun&s;ellors of a people, when he means to de&s;troy them. "The princes of Zoan are become fools, the princes of Noph are deceived, they have al&s;o &s;educed Egypt, even they that are the &s;tay of the tribes thereof. The LORD hath mingled a perver&s;e &s;pirit in the mid&s;t thereof; and they have cau&s;ed Egypt to err in every work thereof, as a drunken man &s;taggereth in his vo|mit." At other times he &s;uffers a panic to &s;eize the mind, and thus routs formidable armies. The dream of a common &s;oldier, told in the camp of Midian, with
<PB N="12" REF="015285_0011_0F9882AEBB207980">
the &s;udden manoeuvre of Gideon according, to GOD's direction, accompanied with but three hundred men, became the occa&s;ion of a compleat rout, and total overthrow of that numerous ho&s;t. The&s;e in&s;tances &s;how the &s;ovran influence of the LORD of ho&s;ts over kings, princes, and powerful armies. Are ho&s;ts of men rai&s;|ed, armed, and directed again&s;t a kingdom, nation, or people? It is by the permi&s;&s;ion of the LORD of ho&s;ts&punc; they are under his direction and controul. "Hitherto &s;halt thou come, but no further." Senacherib mu&s;t not come into the city, "nor &s;hoot an arrow there, nor come before it with &s;hield, nor ca&s;t a bank again&s;t it."</P>
<P>THE LORD of ho&s;ts, &s;ends powerful oppre&s;&s;ing monarchs again&s;t the rod of his inheritance, &s;ometimes as the rod in his hand, to correct, and cha&s;ten his people for their &s;ins; &s;ome times to &s;hew his people his power and pre&s;idency over all ho&s;ts, and to humble them who bla&s;pheme the GOD of I&s;rael. The de&s;truction of Pha|raoh and his ho&s;ts in the red &s;ea&mdash;of Senacherib's army, and the breaking in pieces Syria, and Samaria, who&s;e combination occa&s;ioned &s;uch con&s;ternation to the hou&s;e of Judah, evidence this; neither can we &s;anctify the LORD of ho&s;ts, without &s;uch or &s;imilar conceptions of him, and of his power over all ho&s;ts of angels, men, yea and all nature.</P>
<P>TO &s;anctify the Lord of Ho&s;ts him&s;elf men are to have their dependance upon him, as the &s;upreme ruler over all, to defeat the devices of their proud enemies, and prevent them from accompli&s;hing their intended enterprize. The &s;in of GOD's people at that day was, that upon hearing of a league between Rezin and Pe|kah, they endeavoured to allay their fear by a confede|racy. When GOD &s;mites his people to bring them to a repentance of their &s;ins, and to tru&s;t in him, it is an un|happy mi&s;take in them, to &s;eek relief from their fears
<PB N="13" REF="015285_0012_0F9882AF7ABA4958">
by a confederacy;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The preacher is acting the part of a divine, not of a politician. However confederacies may be lawful in certain ca&s;es, yet a tru&s;t in them to the neglect of tru&s;t in the <HI>LORD</HI> of Ho&s;ts, is &s;inful in all in&s;tances.</NOTE> as though an human arm could defeat the purpo&s;es of Heaven; or the Almighty wanted to &s;ee "the young men ari&s;e and play before him." This is both our &s;in, and our mi&s;ery, as it leads the mind off from the grand object.</P>
<P>HOLY David, &s;eeing the inclination of men to place their dependence upon an arm of fle&s;h, to a neglect of the true GOD, &s;aid, "Put not your tru&s;t in princes, nor in the &s;on of man, in whom there is no help." As though he had &s;aid,&mdash;you may &s;ee the in&s;ufficiency of &s;uch helpers, from the con&s;ideration of their being but mor|tal, &s;hort lived creatures: "His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth, in that very day his thoughts peri&s;h." Wherefore, in&s;tead of putting your tru&s;t in them, whether prince, people, a mighty ho&s;t, or in a confederacy&mdash;&s;anctify the LORD of HOSTS him&s;elf; make him the object of your fear and dependance; "Happy is he that hath the God of Jacob for his help, who&s;e hope is in the LORD his GOD." Making a league, and tru&s;ting in that and in man for &s;alvation out of the hand of enemies, are oppo&s;ite to &s;anctifying the LORD of HOSTS him&s;elf.</P>
<P>AS our GOD is a GOD of invariable ju&s;tice, righte|ou&s;ne&s;s, truth and faithfulne&s;s, &s;o, to &s;anctify the LORD, we are not only to approve of them in &s;peculation, but become followers of him in the practice of them, "as dear children," which, when done in the fear of the LORD of HOSTS, and in obedience to his commands, is true practical knowledge of GOD. "Did not thy fa|ther eat and drink, and do judgment and ju&s;tice, and then it was well with him? He judged the cau&s;e of the
<PB N="14" REF="015285_0013_0F9882B03B70DBA0">
poor and needy, then it was well with him, was not this to know me? Saith the LORD." Where there is nei|ther &s;en&s;e nor practice of equity&mdash;moral hone&s;ty&mdash;no regard to moral obligation, there can be no true reli|gion. A righteous, holy GOD holds him&s;elf bound to puni&s;h all violators of &s;uch &s;olemn obligations. "See|ing he de&s;pi&s;ed the oath by breaking the covenant (when lo, he had given his hand) and hath done all the&s;e things, he &s;hall not e&s;cape."</P>
<P>THIS LORD of HOSTS whom our text calls us to &s;anctify, is no other than ELOHEIM&mdash;the great "Captain of our &s;alvation," who appeared unto Jo|&s;hua as Captain of the LORD's ho&s;t. Unto him hath the father committed all power "in heaven and in earth," and &s;et him at his own right hand in the hea|venly places, far above all principalities and powers, and might and dominion, and every name that is named not only in this world, but al&s;o in that which is to come. And hath put all things under his feet. For he is by nature, and by the act of creation, their lord and proprietor. "For by him were all things created that are in heaven, and that are in earth, vi&s;ible and invi&s;ible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: All things were created by him and for him. And he is before all things, and by him all things con&s;i&s;t." St. Peter &s;ums up go&s;pel holine&s;s in the words before us, "But &s;anctify the LORD GOD in your hearts:" Oppo&s;ed to this, &s;tand, prophanation of GOD's name, titles, attributes and word;&mdash;rejecting CHRIST the &s;on of GOD, a divine per&s;on, with his doc|trines and precepts; al&s;o covetou&s;ne&s;s, which is idola|try. This fruitful &s;ource of evil ought to be expo&s;ed to view, for it &s;ets up the world, and the things of it in the place of God. "That he may &s;et his ne&s;t on high, that he may be delivered from the power of evil." That dependance which holy ones have upon GOD, in
<PB N="15" REF="015285_0014_0F9882B0FACED328">
the way of his wi&s;e and kind protecting providence, the covetous place in gold "which is their hope," and in "fine gold" which is their "confidence." Mam|mon is &s;paring of co&s;t for things that re&s;pect GOD or godline&s;s. It may &s;pare a little to keep its votaries in countenance among men; but it is liberal even to pro|fu&s;ene&s;s and di&s;&s;ipation towards its friends, "the lu&s;t of the fle&s;h, the lu&s;t of the eye, and the pride of life." This very profu&s;ion the coveteous man pre&s;&s;es into his &s;ervice, as an invincible argument, that he is free from covetou&s;ne&s;s. The liberality of the idolator to|wards his beloved lu&s;t, is a perfect de&s;cription of the covetous man, in regard to his darling lu&s;t. "They lavi&s;h gold out of the bag, and weigh &s;ilver in the ballance, and hire a gold&s;mith, and he maketh it a GOD: They fall down, yea they wor&s;hip." This opens to view that &s;eeming contradictory behaviour of the co|vetous man's &s;paring par&s;imony in matters that re&s;pect GOD&mdash;acts of benevolence and deeds of charity, to them that are in di&s;tre&s;s. From this &s;ource &s;pring oppre&s;&s;ion, extortion, and the avaricious unmerciful exactions, of the covetous, to magnify their GOD. Mammon in the heart di&s;&s;olves moral obligations, breaks over the bonds of ju&s;tice, mercy and fidelity; or rather by its &s;orcery makes them appear, but &s;illy bands fit only to bind &s;crupulous con&s;ciences.

<P>ONCE more. The lu&s;t of domination greatly op|po&s;es this &s;anctification of the LORD. As the law of gravitation acts upon matter, pre&s;&s;ing it to the center, unle&s;s &s;ome &s;uperior power re&s;i&s;ts it: So the love of &s;uperiority,&mdash;the lu&s;t of domination runs through fal|len nature. The author of nature many times &s;uffers

this to ballance, and counteract it&s;elf. When it ari&s;es to tyranny and cruel oppre&s;&s;ion, the love of power and liberty, joined to re&s;entment of injury, urges on the oppre&s;&s;ed to curb and de&s;troy it in the tyrant. This lu&s;t, when entrenched behind powerful armies, or the &s;hadow of a righteous con&s;titution, who&s;e vitals are con|&s;umed by venality, bribery and corruption, is the plague of mankind. When mortal men, by art, or &s;tratagem, or &s;uperior craft, have attained to de&s;potic &s;way, this lu&s;t &s;till rages; it thir&s;ts for all power, that no one may have opportunity to oppo&s;e, controul, or ca&s;t it down. This, through a kind of &s;tate magic, brings per|&s;ons over whom &s;uch lord&s;hip and authority are exerci&s;|ed to call them benefactors. Such will always rejoice in the adulatory addre&s;&s;es of fawning &s;ycophants: Be|cau&s;e by the&s;e they have the confe&s;&s;ion of them over whom they exerci&s;e this authority; that they are their benefactors; and &s;o are by their own conce&s;&s;ions cut off from any pretext to oppo&s;e &s;uch domination. This lu&s;t, though mo&s;t vi&s;ible and odious, in per&s;ons at the upper end of the world, may however be &s;een in every cla&s;s of men, from Nimrod, the "mighty hunter," down," down to the pun&s;ter in the meeting of merry Andrews. He that di&s;pairs of gaining this &s;uperiority by arms, will &s;eek it in &s;ome other way: &s;ome in dre&s;s, others in popularity, others in a little exaltation in of|fice. From this &s;prings envy at the promotion of my neighbour above dear me: Hence canva&s;&s;ing at elec|tions for places of honor and power: So equity, righ|teou&s;ne&s;s and public good are often &s;acrificed to this lu&s;t of domination: So dear &s;elf is adored; but the LORD of Ho&s;ts not &s;anctified, The only cure of this evil is by the &s;anctification of the &s;oul, which brings it to e&s;teem &s;uperiority in righteou&s;ne&s;s and goodne&s;s,&mdash; "And the upright &s;hall have dominion over them in the morning."</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="015285_0016_0F9882B27ABDF2D8">PRAYER, comprized by our Saviour under the term of thank&s;giving, is a duty which would have been obli|gatory upon man though he had remained innocent.</P>
<P>THE gift of a Saviour, and the ble&s;&s;igs of that "co|venant ordered in all things and &s;ure," lays a founda|tion for petition, for pardon of &s;in, and deliverance from evils. This Mo&s;es the &s;ervant of the LORD u&s;ed, when GOD's people were encountering their enemies. Our GOD would have us &s;en&s;ible, that we are dependent up|on him for victory.

<P>IN &s;uch faith and practice, fear of man may be over|come by a chri&s;tian fear of the LORD of Ho&s;ts, and &s;uch may (through grace) &s;ay with Holy David, "Tho' an ho&s;t &s;hould encamp again&s;t me, my heart &s;hall not fear: Though war &s;hould ri&s;e up again&s;t me, in this will I be confident."

<P N="2">II. It is the duty and intere&s;t of GOD's people to &s;anctify him, e&s;pecially in times of iminent danger. The private centinel, under the wi&s;e&s;t and able&s;t Ge|neral on earth, is not under &s;o powerful obligations, to an implicit ob&s;ervation, of general orders, as we are to obey this King of Kings. Upon him we are depend|ent for "life, breath, and all things." The obligation ari&s;es from the relation God has put us in to him, by creation: All is from him and all due to him; and
<PB N="18" REF="015285_0017_0F9882B33AC257D8">
for di&s;obedience we are holden unto judgment, not meerly the lo&s;s of temporal, but al&s;o of eternal life. The obligation is renewed upon us, by that gracious act of redemption. "Ye are bought with a price; therefore glorify GOD in your body, and in your &s;pirit, which are GOD's."</P>
<P>ALL the benefits of the new covenant are as &s;o many cords binding us. By all the&s;e "tender mercies of the Lord" are we befought. He is the greate&s;t benefactor of man: Gratitude calls for it. Man's mouth in inno|cence was filled with arguments for this &s;ervice. The very &s;ituation of man in re&s;pect to the other creatures&mdash; Lord over them, as though the great high prie&s;t, over the lower creation, to offer up a tribute of prai&s;e on their behalf, points him to this duty; but the con&s;titu|tion of Heaven, committing all power to the "Cap|tain of our &s;alvation," and the expre&s;s requirement of it by I&s;rael's God, from a covenant people, make all other arguments needle&s;s.</P>
<P>IN point of intere&s;t, this is the only thing that can give &s;afety. Real holine&s;s is the be&s;t defence. When &s;alvation is the walls and bulworks of a people, they mu&s;t be happy. "The eyes of the LORD are upon the righteous, and his ears are open to their cry. The face of the LORD is again&s;t them that do evil, to cut off the remembrance of them from the earth." When vital piety reigns in the hearts of GOD's people, their light &s;hall "break forth as the morning, and their health &s;hall &s;pring forth &s;peedily; and thy righteou&s;ne&s;s &s;hall go before thee; the glory of the LORD &s;hall be thy rere|ward" When a man's ways plea&s;e the LORD, he maketh even his enemies to be at peace with him. This holy fear of our GOD, is the alone principle, ex|cept that of &s;tupidity, or carnal &s;ecurity, or pre&s;ump|tion, that can prevent the fear of man, and of their

threatnings.&mdash;Our LORD ever applied this, as the all|&s;ovran remedy again&s;t the fear of man. "Fear not them that are able to kill the body," &amp;c. When his di&s;ciples were thrown into con&s;ternation, at the thought of his departure; ob&s;erve the cure pre&s;cribed by this in|falliable phy&s;ician&mdash;"Ye believe in GOD: believe al&s;o in me." The apo&s;tles, &s;anctifying the Lord in their hearts, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed their &s;ouls in peace. "None of the&s;e things moved them."&mdash;They rejoiced in the LORD, and went on quiet, in the mid&s;t of mo&s;t eminent dangers. This is a certain way to &s;ecure his protecti|on, to obtain dominion over enemies, and to enjoy the real enjoyments of "the glory of all lands."

to keep pace with the prevailing cu&s;tom of the times. Nothing &s;hort of nonimportation, could recover men to their &s;en&s;es, and bring us to value our flax, wool, and fine&s;t of the wheat, above baubles. All the teaching and rea&s;oning of the able&s;t among us, backed with the authority of GOD's word, could not avail to arou&s;e this people out of their lethargy. "Ephraim is joined to idols," and after them he would go. The hard nece&s;&s;i|ty of war, and of &s;uch a war as dried up the &s;treams of luxury in a great mea&s;ure, mu&s;t force us to indu&s;try, frugality and oeconomy.

But, Sir, is there one con&s;ideration that can give you more &s;atisfaction, than the te&s;timony of con&s;cience, that you have &s;ancti|fied the LORD of HOSTS him&s;elf, and made him your fear and dread, and have u&s;ed your influence to engage the numerous bands under your command, to follow your example.</P>
<P>THE good plea&s;ure of the MOST HIGH, in choo&s;ing and placing your Honor in &s;uch a peculiar &s;ituation&mdash; la&s;t Governor of the Colony of Connecticut&mdash;fir&s;t in this free and independent State; where labours indeed, have been more abundant;&mdash;rai&s;ing you up for this ve|ry

purpo&s;e, and girding your loins, to go through the work which, in its con&s;equences, may have connexion with the happine&s;s of unborn multitudes, even through eternity, may well excite gratitude to your great Ma&s;|ter, who has thought fit to employ you in &s;o great and honorable &s;ervice. This thought was in the mind of St. Paul; "And I thank CHRIST JESUS, our LORD, who hath enabled me, for that he counted me faithful, putting me into the mini&s;try." This will not &s;ail to rai&s;e your mind above the toils of mortal life, while you have a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of integrity, aiming at the glo|ry of the great &s;upreme over all.</P>
<P>THE plea&s;ing thought that your Honor's name will &s;tand inroll'd in the annals of America, among the fir&s;t of her worthies, who live at this important cri&s;is, has the LORD of ho&s;ts allowed you, as a ballance for the far more exceeding labours and fatigues that attend this day of America's tribulation. This, in regard to earthly honors, is thy portion from the LORD.</P>
<P>LET tho&s;e who have not learn'd to extend their views beyond pecuniary emoluments, and ful&s;ome adulation, fea&s;t upon the &s;miles of earthly monarchs, and &s;tretch them&s;elves on beds of ivory; but more &s;ub&s;tantial joys be thy portion.</P>
<P>IT was &s;poken to the prai&s;e of the angel of the church of Thyatyra, "I know thy works, and charity, and &s;ervice, and faith, and thy patience, and thy works; and the la&s;t to be more than the fir&s;t." Works done in love to GOD&punc; and man, &s;ervice done, in faith, patience, and works abounding more at la&s;t than fir&s;t, will not fail of a reward. The well grounded expectation of this, affords a mo&s;t animating &s;upport. May your Honor's life be &s;pared&mdash;your u&s;efulne&s;s be increa&s;ed&mdash;your loins be girded to go through the work which GOD in his providence allots you, and your re|ward in contemplating the connxion which your labours

<HEAD>An ADDRES to his HONOR the DEPUTY GOVERNOR, the Honorable ASSISTANTS in COUNCIL, and Wor|thy REPRESENTATIVES of the FREEMEN of this STATE.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>HONORED GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN as much as civil in&s;titutions, are a &s;ub&s;titute for lo&s;t innocence, u&s;ed by GOD to curb the violent pa&s;&s;ions of men, and con&s;train them to regard righteou&s;ne&s;s, and &s;ocial virtues: The work allotted to you, Gentlemen, in your legi&s;lative character, is very &s;erious, &s;olemn, and important; and ever ought to be entered upon, with a becoming &s;en&s;e of accountablene&s;s to him, who&s;e is the kingdom. Permit me fir&s;t to &s;ay with due de|ference, "Wor&s;hip him all ye gods." Nothing can better quality you for this important &s;ervice, than ex|ten&s;ive knowledge, joined to the fear of the LORD. Be entreated to bear in your minds; the great ends of go|vernment, even to reform the morals of the &s;ubject. GOD has called you to be "&s;trong rods," to correct the wicked; or in St. Paul's words, to be "the mi|ni&s;ter of GOD, a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doth evil." In this view ye are mini&s;ters of GOD for good to his people, con&s;training them by civil rules to "walk hone&s;tly as in the day." The &s;ecurity of property by righteous ordinances, and protection of the &s;ubject, in lawful and u&s;eful employments, gives them opportunity, to "lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godline&s;s and hone&s;ty." To which end, righteou&s;ne&s;s &s;hould be the ba&s;is of law&mdash;an additional force to the
<PB N="30" REF="015285_0029_0F9882BC40DA8D38">
dictates of well informed con&s;cience. The obligation of the ruled to obey, &s;hould &s;eldom depend &s;olely upon, "<HI>Be it enacted,</HI> &amp;c." Men may feel the force of law by it's penalty; but will not be formed to virtue by &s;uch ordinances.</P>
<P>GOD's &s;ervants in authority, &s;hould imitate him "all who&s;e ways are judgment;" who &s;peaks "in righte|ou&s;ne&s;s." America groaning under the mo&s;t barbar|ous treatment&mdash;condemned, unheard&mdash;her children pronounced rebels, when in the peace of GOD and the king&mdash;praying for the welfare of the king, and nation: &s;entenced to be dragged away in chains to Britain, up|on &s;u&s;picion of crimes:&mdash;troops let loo&s;e upon us, &s;heathing their &s;words in the bowels of them, who&s;e hone&s;t indu&s;try fed great numbers in the Briti&s;h i&s;le: loudly calls upon you, to form laws in righteou&s;ne&s;s, con&s;onant to the mild and equitable government of Zion's King, One great de&s;ign among others is, by civil ordinances to lead men to reverence, and honor the GOD's among men: that their minds being habi|tuated to reverence &s;uperiors, may be prepared to re|verence and &s;anctify the LORD of HOSTS. Therefore, it becomes very important for you, to maintain your authority, and the dignity of law:&mdash;to &s;ee that no laws be trampled upon with impunity:&mdash;that there be no <HI>formido avium</HI>: that fines and penalties be duly exact|ed. It is no mercy to a community, to u&s;e exce&s;s of lenity towards tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors. Great is the importance of having executive officers faithful, to put into exe|cution the good laws of the State. Is there not a de|ficiency here? Why does profane &s;wearing abound, while there are good and whole&s;ome laws to &s;uppre&s;s it? Why are the &s;abbaths of the LORD profaned, and &s;o little notice taken of offenders? Why &s;o few pro&s;ecu|cutions upon the late law again&s;t oppre&s;&s;ion, when there are known <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> 
<PB N="31" REF="015285_0030_0F9882BD001FA590">
taken of offenders? Such neglects, de&s;troy the ma|je&s;ty of authority, and teach men to de&s;pi&s;e dominion, and &s;peak evil of dignities; the morals of the people are hereby corrupted, while the hands of rulers are weakened, and one of the great ends of government fru&s;trated. What other mea&s;ures ought to be taken, to &s;tir up under officers to faithfulne&s;s, and to revive antient zeal for the &s;upport of authority, belongs to the civil department to determine.</P>
<P>IF there is a defect here, may not lovers of order and virtue believe, that the zeal and watchful care of this honorable body, will &s;oon quicken the &s;lothful, and &s;upport the faithful?</P>
<P>AS the religion of our ble&s;&s;ed LORD is the mo&s;t com|pleat &s;y&s;tem of morality, ever yet taught in our world, be&s;t calculated to render men good &s;ubjects of civil &s;o|ciety: &s;o it claims the &s;upport of a chri&s;tian magi&s;tra|cy. All who profe&s;s a belief of the being of one GOD &mdash;the Me&s;&s;iah&s;hip of JESUS of NAZARETH&mdash;the nece&s;|&s;ity of the &s;aving influences of the Holy Spirit, and that the "lively oracles" of the old and new te&s;tament, are the revealed will of GOD, the appointed rule of faith and manners; have a ju&s;t claim to protection from the magi&s;trate. To require &s;uch to &s;upport this &s;y&s;tem of morality, for the benefit of civil community, is no more ab&s;urd, than to require them to &s;upport &s;chools of education, to render youths good members of &s;o|ciety. <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Arguments for religious e&s;tabli&s;hments, &s;hould &s;tand up|on the ground of morality. This takes the plea of con&s;cience out of the mouths of particular &s;ects. Such as openly plead, that it is again&s;t their con&s;ciences, to &s;upport morality for the good of civil community, forfeit all claim to the benefit of law and protection.</NOTE></P>
<P>EVERY religious &s;ect, within the above de&s;cription,
<PB N="32" REF="015285_0031_0F9882BDC0580EF8">
ought to enjoy a due proportion of the expence they contribute, for the &s;upport of this &s;y&s;tem, to employ if they plea&s;e, teachers of it, according to their own tenets; but if they refu&s;e to u&s;e it this way, may it not become the civil power to &s;et it apart, to the &s;upport of morality in the education of youths, or &s;ome other way?</P>
<P>WHILE your attention is drawn to the "battle of the warrior&mdash;and garments rolled in blood;" there is not a little danger of neglecting the arts of peace. The nece&s;&s;ity of education, to the very being of a free go|vernment, is &s;hewn by the author of America's Ap|peal to the Impartial World, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Page</HI> 67, 68.</NOTE> to good advantage&mdash; want of time forbids a recital. To &s;olicit a benevo|lence of a pecuniary kind, for the mu&s;es at this time, when there are &s;uch abundant demands, for immediate defence; might appear incon&s;iderate. The &s;miles of this body, in every rea&s;onable way, "will be as the light of the morning, when the &s;un ri&s;eth; even a morning without clouds;" a &s;trengthening of free go|vernment, therefore to be de&s;ired, by all lovers of vir|tue, knowledge, education, and true liberty. Are not the&s;e in&s;tances within your department, in which ye may &s;anctify the LORD of Ho&s;ts, and influence others al&s;o? May your hearts be inclined to ari&s;e up and do the work, and the LORD give you wi&s;dom and under|&s;tanding in the&s;e things.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>REVEREND SIRS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>None of you can be more &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee me in this de&s;k upon this occa&s;ion, than I was at his Honor's call to it. But at a day, when providence, and our country call every one to exert them&s;elves, who dur&s;t withold their be&s;t endeavours? The work GOD has allotted to us, to be in&s;truments in his hands, to lead men to &s;anctify the LORD GOD in their hearts, is truly great, excellent and divine. This, &s;tanding in connexion with the de&s;ign of civil magi&s;tracy, ought to unite our hearts and hands with them, in preparing a people for the LORD. Mo&s;es and Aaron &s;hould walk hand in hand; and duty demands our prayers for them. The vi&s;ible &s;ins of the day, prophanene&s;s, hypocri&s;y, gree|dine&s;s of gain&mdash;the want of public virtue and moral hone&s;ty; ought not to e&s;cape our notice, in our pa&s;to|ral labours. I need not mind you, that to us it belongs to teach the pure doctrines of the go&s;pel, with uncor|ruptne&s;s, gravity and &s;incerity&mdash;to urge the nece&s;&s;ity of regeneration by the &s;pirit of GOD&mdash;of ju&s;tification freely by his grace, through the redemption that is in JESUS CHRIST&mdash;to pre&s;s go&s;pel motives to holine&s;s, with the precious promi&s;e of a&s;&s;i&s;tance here, and immortal life in the heavenly world; with the terrors of the LORD, to awaken the carele&s;s and &s;ecure; and all with an humble &s;en&s;e of the utter impotency of men and means, without GOD's ble&s;&s;ing. May no 'vain jang|ling hinder us from pur&s;uing "the end of the com|mandment," even "charity, out of a pure heart, and of a good con&s;cience&punc; and of faith unfeigned." May it plea&s;e GOD (&s;trengthening and a&s;&s;i&s;ting us by his grace) to make us in&s;trumental of turning many "from dark|ne&s;s to light;" in which we have the greate&s;t induce|ment to indu&s;try and fidelity; from the love of CHRIST

<HEAD>An ADDRESS to the numerous auditory now pre&s;ent.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>FRIENDS, and FELLOW CHRISTIANS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THAT this is a day of darkne&s;s and perplexity, none can deny&mdash;that this &s;ore di&s;pen&s;ation of heaven is &s;ent upon us for our &s;ins, none but infidels will doutb. If it is the de&s;ign of heaven, to give us a name among the nations, it is nece&s;&s;ary we &s;hould be purged. That boa&s;ting at putting on the harne&s;s, which had &s;uch a run la&s;t year, would, unchecked, render us offen&s;ive to GOD, and intolerable to men. The LORD of HOSTS found a way to humble us. And if it is the will of GOD that we &s;hould emerge out of the&s;e troubles, there is more yet to be done. The &s;in of covetou&s;ne&s;s, now too manife&s;t to be denied, needs to be removed. The &s;in of profanene&s;s, is highly di&s;plea&s;ing to GOD. That &s;elfi&s;h &s;pirit which leads to extortion is greatly alarming. The&s;e enemies among our&s;elves, endanger us more than all the embattled troops of Britons and mer|cinaries. To avoid oppre&s;&s;ion, we judged it lawful to re&s;i&s;t Great-Britain. Shall we &s;hew our&s;elves the op|pre&s;&s;ors&mdash;dig our own grave, and &s;eal our own de&s;truc|tion? GOD has in his providence, ca&s;t us into this fur|nace to prove us&mdash;to &s;hew us what was in our hearts; yet who is humbled, who is reformed? If judgments
<PB N="36" REF="015285_0035_0F9882C0BAB2EAA0">
don't produce repentence, let mercy in judgment, bring you to ingenuous &s;orrow for your tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>THROUGH unde&s;erved mercy, GOD's conduct has hi|therto been, towards us, as it was towards I&s;rael, in the days of Jehoahaz; when they were oppre&s;&s;ed by Ha|zael king of Syria. "And the LORD was gracious to them, and had compa&s;&s;ion on them, and had re&s;pect unto them; becau&s;e of his covenant with Abraham, I&s;aac and Jacob, and would not de&s;troy them, neither ca&s;t he them from his pre&s;ence as yet."</P>
<P>WHY if GOD had written Lo-ammi upon us, did he not withhold the ble&s;&s;ing of fullne&s;s in the latter harve&s;t? Why were not the enemy &s;uffered to over-run all the&s;e States? Why were our brethren victorious at Charle&s;|town in South-Carolina? Why did GOD &s;uffer that &s;ea|&s;onable &s;upply of powder to fall into our hands, by the brave Capt. MUGFORD? (whom we could have wi&s;hed a better fate.) Why was the manufacture of Salt-Petre brought to perfection in a few months: by which two favours our privateers were enabled to afford &s;up|plies of We&s;t-India goods, and much cloathing? Why have we been favored with &s;ucce&s;s near Harlem&mdash;at Trenton and Princetown, and the enemy driven back? The&s;e things &s;hould &s;upport our minds under the re|buke, and animate us to amend every thing that is ami&s;s. The language of GOD to his people once was, "You only have I known of all the families of the earth: Therefore will I puni&s;h you for all your iniquities." Let us then open our "ears to di&s;cipline," and pa|teintly accept this puni&s;hment upon this family which has been near to GOD. "Break off your &s;ins by righ|teou&s;ne&s;s, and" your "iniquities, by &s;hewing mercy to the poor." Then GOD will find other employment for your enemies. But if this people are re&s;olved to walk each one after the &s;ight of his own eyes, and in the imagination of his own heart, and &s;ay, "we are
<PB N="37" REF="015285_0036_0F9882C17AC2E478">
delivered to do all the&s;e abominations," behold the feet of them who have wa&s;ted towns, and pilaged the inha|bitants, are at the door!</P>
