<HEAD>To the READER.</HEAD>
<P>BEfore I &s;peak of the Unlawfulne&s;s of this Practice of making Slaves, it is in my Mind to give a Relation how, and after what Manner I came to under&s;tand it &s;o; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> why, and for what Rea&s;on I now &s;peak a|gain&s;t it. After I had arrived to the Years of a Man, I was very de&s;irous that I might come to know the Lord for my &s;elf: For altho' I did believe I was educated or taught the right way, yet upon &s;erious Con&s;ideration, I came to &s;ee that the Religion of a Man's Education, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">as not the Religion of his, but of them that educated him: And therefore I was very de&s;irous to know him for my &s;elf; for I read in Scripture, that when De&s;truction came upon the City, that if <HI>Daniel, Noah</HI> and <HI>Job</HI> were in it, they by their Righteou&s;ne&s;s could &s;ave none but their own Souls. And altho' I might live in the mid&s;t of a righteous People, I &s;aw that it would not avail any thing to me. And as I was thus concern'd, it plea&s;ed the Lord in his own Time to manife&s;t him&s;elf to me, in &s;ome &s;mall Degree and Mea|&s;ure,
<PB N="ii" REF="003644_0003_10023B47A3E68570">
&s;o that then I could di&s;cern Things aright in &s;ome degree; and after I had con&s;idered the Principles of tho&s;e my Friends called <HI>Quakers,</HI> I did, and now do believe that they are unde|niably good, and that tho&s;e that keep clo&s;e to them. I do believe that there can never any Weapon be formed that &s;hall prevail again&s;t them. And as I con&s;ider'd thereon, I found a Nece&s;&s;ity in my &s;elf to join with tho&s;e People, who&s;e principles were &s;o good: Yet notwith|&s;tanding I mu&s;t confe&s;s, (and for that Rea&s;on I now write) that as I knew a Nece&s;&s;ity to join with them in that which was good; the &s;ame Nece&s;&s;ity I now find to &s;peak again&s;t that which is evil, altho' it may be in &s;ome of them. For the Lord made me &s;en&s;ible in that convincing Day, that he would not allow of Sin, altho' it might be in <HI>Jacob,</HI> and that Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion in <HI>I&s;|rael</HI> &s;hould not go unpuni&s;hed, and that he would yet again &s;earch <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> as with Candles, and bring to Light the hidden Things of Di&s;ho|ne&s;ty.</P>
<P>And now, altho' &s;ome may think it hard to have this Practice &s;poken again&s;t, that has been carried on &s;o long pretty much in Silence; I may let &s;uch know, that I have found it hard to write again&s;t it; yet neverthele&s;s believing it to be my Duty &s;o to do, I have written according to the Under&s;tanding I have had thereof. And
<PB N="iii" REF="003644_0004_10023B59DEEDDCA8">
altho' I have written but little, and in a very plain Way, yet I hope that tho&s;e Remarks I have made thereon, may &s;erve as a Text for &s;ome to preach to them&s;elves upon. I am not unthought|ful of the Ferment or Stir that &s;uch Di&s;cour&s;e as this may make among &s;ome, who (like <HI>Deme|trius</HI> of old) may &s;ay, By this Craft have we our Wealth, which cau&s;ed the People to cry out with one Voice, &s;aying, Great is <HI>Diana</HI> of the <HI>Ephe&s;ians,</HI> whom all <HI>A&s;ia</HI> and the World wor|&s;hip. Therefore leaving &s;uch to wor&s;hip what they will, I will al&s;o &s;ay, that there is many &s;o|ber Men that has &s;poken again&s;t this Practice, both by Writing and in their publick A&s;&s;emblies, whom I could Name, but chu&s;ing to be brief, I will only ob&s;erve to the Reader, what I my &s;elf have ob&s;erved, and that is, that tho&s;e People that dwell neare&s;t the Truth, and are mo&s;t en|gaged in it, and are more concern'd for the &s;preading of it, than for any thing in this World be&s;ide, cannot allow of this Practice, they &s;eeing it to be Oppre&s;&s;ion and Cruelty.</P>
<P>Now I having &s;poken &s;omething of the Rea|&s;on why I have wrote this, I will conclude this my Preface, wi&s;hing the Reader an impartial Judgment.</P>

<HEAD>A TESTIMONY Again&s;t that Antichri&s;tian Practice of Making Slaves of Men.</HEAD>
<P>SUCH hath been the Love and Goodne&s;s of God to Men, that in all Ages of the Word he has had a People, Family or Church whom he hath called and al&s;o cho&s;en, to bear a Te&s;timony to his Name and Truth: Yet it may be ob&s;erved by them that read the holy Scriptures, that tho&s;e People whom he had called, and favoured above all the Families of the Earth, and had wrought Signs and Wonders for them, and had exalted them in the Sight of their Enemies; that tho&s;e Peo|ple in Times of Liberty and Ea&s;e, grew forget|ful

of God. This aptne&s;s to forget God in a Time of Ea&s;e, the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> well knew, after that he had a Thorn in the Fle&s;h, or the Me&s;&s;enger of Satan to buffet him (as he calls it) for before he was afflicted he went a&s;tray, therefore he knew Cha&s;ti&s;ement or Affliction to be profitable for him, and could then &s;ay, I take Plea&s;ure in Infirmities, in Reproaches, in Nece&s;&s;ities, in Per&s;ecutions, in Di&s;tre&s;&s;es for Chri&s;t's &s;ake: For when I am Weak, then am I Strong. 2 <HI>Corin.</HI> 12. 10. It may be al&s;o ob&s;er|ved by them who read the Book of Martyrs or Sufferings of the People of God, from the Time our Lord was crucified, down to the Reign of the bloody Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> (which Hi&s;tory I do believe is believed to be true by mo&s;t Prote&s;|tants) that in all that Length of Time, God had a People whom he had called out of the Wor|&s;hip, Ways and Cu&s;toms of the World, who were a &s;uffering People, and that in the mid&s;t of their greate&s;t Sufferings, they were the mo&s;t immediately upheld by the Divine Power of God; &s;o that they could even Rejoice in the Flames. But when it plea&s;ed God that a good King or Emperor came to Rule, &s;o that they were not per&s;ecuted or oppre&s;&s;ed, that they grew forgetful of God, and &s;ome of them be|came Oppre&s;&s;ors them&s;elves. Now I do be|lieve that God &s;ometimes afflicteth outwardly, and &s;ometimes inwardly, who be&s;t knows the

Rod that is &s;uitable to cha&s;tize with. We may ob&s;erve al&s;o how it hath been with our elder Friends, who were a harmle&s;s and &s;uffering People, who did not only bear Te<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">mony <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Word, but in Practice al&s;o, again&s;t all outward and carnal Weapons; which our Friend <HI>Robert Barclay</HI> ob&s;erving, &s;aid, that it was their inno|cent Lives and Conver&s;ations that convinced him, before ever he in&s;pected into their Princi|ples. He did not &s;ee them in this Practice of making Slaves of their Fellow Creatures, which Practice is upheld by the carnal Sword only&punc; but he bore a Te&s;timony again&s;t the carnal Sword, and would not allow of it to be u&s;ed, altho' it were in Self-Pre&s;ervation. Such Inno|cency was in that worthy Man, as well as many others in that Day, that they would not allow of this Practice, having more regard to that Command of Chri&s;t's, (to do to others as we would they &s;hould do to us) than to any out|ward Advantage in this World. And after our Friend <HI>George Fox</HI> had travelled in the I&s;land of <HI>Barbadoes</HI> in the <HI>We&s;t Indies,</HI> where he &s;aw this Practice of making Slaves, even to that degree, that their Hou&s;es were black with them, that he bore open Te&s;timony again&s;t it, when he got home he wrote a little Book to them, wherein I find the&s;e Words, <Q><HI>And if thy Brother, an Hebrew Man, or an Hebrew Woman, be &s;old unto thee, and &s;erve thee &s;ix Years, then in the

<P>Now by the&s;e Words (tho' but a &s;mall part of what he wrote) we may &s;ee that he was a|gain&s;t making Slaves of Men. Now I do be|lieve if Men were ingenuous to acknowledge to the Truth, even as their Con&s;ciences bear them Witne&s;s, I need not go any farther for a Proof again&s;t this Practice: But becau&s;e they be not, I will turn al&s;o to the holy Scriptures, that &s;o they that are in this Practice may be condem|ned by both.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> we may ob&s;erve, when God had created Man, that he gave him a free Will, and would not compel the Will of Man, no not to that which was Good, much le&s;s to that which was Evil; therefore we ought not to compel our Fellow Creatures.</P>
<P><HI>Objection,</HI> But had not God's People Bond-Servants in all Ages of the World, bought with their Money? To which I An&s;wer, that in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the Time of the Law they had Bond-Servants bought with their Money; but the Apo&s;tle &s;uch, <HI>The Servant abideth not in the Hou&s;e ever.</HI> Now the Word <HI>Servant</HI> I under&s;tand to be but

for a Time, but the Word <HI>Slave</HI> for ever. And tho&s;e that merchandiz'd in Slaves we may find were <HI>Babilon'</HI>s Merchants, <HI>Rev.</HI> 18. 13. And tho&s;e that had Bond-Servants under the Law, were commanded to let them go free after &s;ome Time of Service, and they were not to let them go empty handed neither, which &s;ome of them not ob&s;erving, the Lord complained by the Prophet <HI>Jeremiah,</HI> that they <HI>have not hear|kened unto me, in proclaiming Liberty every one to has Brother, and every Man to his Neighbour: Be|hold, I proclaim a Liberty for you, &s;aith the Lord, to the Sword, to the Pe&s;tilence, and to the Famine, and I will make you to be removed into all the King|doms of the Earth.</HI> Jer. 34. 17.</P>
<P><HI>Objection,</HI> But they were of their own Na|tion that the Command was again&s;t; now the&s;e Negroes are not of our own Nation, but are mere Infidels and Strangers. To which Ob|jection I'll An&s;wer as it is written in <HI>Exod.</HI> 22. 21. <HI>Ye &s;hall neither vex a Stranger, nor oppre&s;s him, for ye were Strangers in the Land of Egypt.</HI> And <HI>Exod.</HI> 23. 9. <HI>Al&s;o thou &s;halt not oppre&s;s a Stran|ger, for ye know the Heart of a Stranger, &s;eeing ye were Strangers in the Land of</HI> Egypt. Now I do not find that it is any more allowable to make a Slave of an Unbeliever, than a Believer, &s;eeing we are commanded, <HI>Mat.</HI> 7. 12. <HI>There|fore all things what&s;oever ye would that Men &s;hould do to you, do ye even &s;o to them, for this is the Law
<PB N="8" REF="003644_0012_10023B87D389A1F8">
and the Prophets.</HI> Now we may &s;ee that this was not only a Command of Chri&s;t's, but was the Law and the Prophets al&s;o; and tho&s;e that comes to ob&s;erve that Command, even fulfil both Tables at once. Now I have often con|&s;idered how earne&s;tly &s;ome Men will &s;earch in|to the Etemology or Original of &s;ome Things that may be but &s;mall, and in the mean while omit the greater. Now in my Judgment every thing ought to be looked upon according to the Importance, Weight or Value of the Thing; for to be very zealous in a &s;mall Thing, and to pa&s;s lightly over a greater, that Zeal may be properer called Super&s;tition than good Zeal, which &s;hould be grounded upon Knowledge. Now I would have all to con&s;ider of this Prac|tice of making Slaves of Negroes, or others that we can get the Ma&s;tery over, to &s;ee upon what Foundation it &s;tands, or to &s;ee whats the Original of it, whether or no Pride and Idlene&s;s was not the fir&s;t ri&s;e of it, that they might go with white Hands, and that their Wives might (<HI>Jezebel</HI> like) paint and adorn them&s;elves, and their Sons and Daughters be brought up in Idle|ne&s;s, which may be very well termed the Mo|ther of all Vice; for it is generally the riche&s;t &s;ort of People that have them, that could do be&s;t without them, for the Poor are not &s;o able to get them.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="003644_0013_10023B89B9306180">
But &s;ome may object, as I my &s;elf have heard them, that there was a Mark &s;et upon <HI>Cain,</HI> and they do believe that the&s;e Negroes are the Po&s;|terity of <HI>Cain,</HI> becau&s;e of their Hair, and their being &s;o black, differing from all others, and that <HI>Canaan</HI> was to be a Servant of Servants to his Brethren, whom they take to be of the &s;ame Linage: But if we do but ob&s;erve, and read in the Genealogy of <HI>Cain,</HI> we may find that they were all drowned in the old World, and that <HI>Canaan</HI> was of the Line of <HI>Seth.</HI> And altho' it was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the Will of God that the World was drowned, becau&s;e of their great Wickedne&s;s; yet we may ob&s;erve al&s;o, that there was un|clean Bea&s;ts went into the Ark, as well as clean, and that it was the Will or Permi&s;&s;ion of God, that there &s;hould be a <HI>Ham,</HI> as well as a <HI>Shem</HI> and <HI>Japhet:</HI> By which we may &s;ee that God &s;uffers wicked Men to live as well as Righteous, and we find that the Sun &s;hineth on the Evil as well as on the Good, and that the Rain fal|leth on the Unju&s;t as well as the Ju&s;t, and that Chri&s;t forbids his Followers to meddle with the Tares le&s;t they hurt the Wheat; there|fore none can have any Plea for making of them Slaves, for their being either ignorant or wick|ed; for if that Plea would do, I do believe they need not go &s;o far for Slaves as now they do.</P>
<P>And altho' <HI>Canaan</HI> was to be a Servant of Servants to his Brethren, yet the Lord after|wards
<PB N="10" REF="003644_0014_10023B6C9AE19398">
&s;pake by the Prophets, that the Son &s;hould not bear the Iniquity of the Father, nor the Fa|ther &s;hould not bear the Iniquity of the Son, but the Soul that &s;inneth &s;hould die. Then the Po&s;terity of <HI>Canaan,</HI> or of <HI>Ham,</HI> do not bear their Sins: And the Apo&s;tle <HI>Peter</HI> &s;aith, <HI>Now I perceive of a Truth that God is no re&s;pecter of Per|&s;ons, but in every Nation he that feareth God and worketh Righteou&s;ne&s;s, is accepted of him.</HI> Now al|tho' the Negroes might not have the Under|&s;tanding that &s;ome other Nations have, then I do believe there is the le&s;s required, and if they do but as well as they know, I do believe it is well with them. For <HI>John</HI> the Divine faith in the <HI>Revelations,</HI> that he &s;aw them that were <HI>&s;ealed in their Foreheads, of the Tribes of I&s;rael, of each Tribe Twelve Thou&s;and, which made an Hun|dred and Forty and Four Thou&s;and: And after this I beheld</HI> (&s;aid he) <HI>and lo a great Multitude which no Man could Number, of all Nations, and Kindreds, and People, and Tongues, &s;tood before the Throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with white Robes, and Palms in their Hands, and they cried with a loud Voice, &s;aying, Salvation to our God, which &s;itteth upon the Throne, and unto the Lamb,</HI> Rev. 7. 9, 10. Now if there was of all Nati|ons, Kindreds, Tongues and People, then there was &s;ome of the Negroes.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="003644_0015_10023B9BFAE4F338">
Now altho' the <HI>Turks</HI> make Slaves of tho&s;e they can catch, that are not of their Religion, yet (as Hi&s;tory relates) as &s;oon as any embraces the Mahomitan Religion, they are no longer kept Slaves, but are quickly &s;et free, and for the mo&s;t part put to &s;ome place of Preferment; &s;o zealous are they for Pro&s;elites and their own Religion. Now if many among tho&s;e called <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> would but con&s;ider how far they fall &s;hort of the <HI>Turks</HI> in this Particular, it would be well; for they tell the Negroes that they mu&s;t believe in Chri&s;t, and receive the Chri&s;tian Faith, and that they mu&s;t receive the Sacra|ment, and be baptized, and &s;o they do; but &s;till they keep them Slaves for all this. Now how partial are tho&s;e that can judge a Negro that &s;hould run away from his Ma&s;ter to de|&s;erve beating, and if one called a Chri&s;tian (al|tho' it may be no better Chri&s;tian than the other) &s;hould run away from the <HI>Turks,</HI> they can judge him to be a good Fellow, and to have done well. Now I look upon this Practice of making Slaves to be &s;o great a Sin, that even Men who&s;e Principles will allow of killing Men in their own Defence, will not allow of making Slaves; for they counting it better to deprive them of Life that ri&s;e up again&s;t them, than to deprive tho&s;e of Liberty that have done them no Harm.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="003644_0016_10023B7CCC4622B8">
Now if any one &s;hould ask one of the Ne|groes Ma&s;ters that had a Negro Child and a Child of his own, what Harm the one had done, that it &s;hould be made a Slave more than the other&punc; that they would not I believe be able to an&s;wer it; and if they have done us no Harm, (as it is evident they have not) then it is very contrary to Scripture, and even to Nature, to make them &s;uffer. Now if we will but look back into the Original of this Practice, which ought to be mo&s;t looked into, and &s;poken again&s;t; for until the Cau&s;e is removed, I know not how the Effect &s;hould cea&s;e; we &s;hall find that they were &s;tollen in the fir&s;t place either by them that fetched them, or they carrying &s;uch Goods as induced &s;ome of their own Nation to &s;teal them; and they &s;tanding ready to receive them, which is as bad as if they had &s;tollen them them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Now we may find that Man-&s;tealing and Man-&s;laying were joined together, and there was the &s;ame Puni&s;hment for the one as for the other.

The Prohibition is general, he that &s;tealeth away Man, a Brother or a Stran|ger, or Heathen, or any Man, the Puni&s;hment is Capital; for he that killed was to be put to Death, becau&s;e it was the Image of God, <HI>Gen.</HI> 9. 6.

<P><HI>Objection,</HI> But how can this Practice of mak|ing Slaves be &s;o great a Sin, when it is &s;o gene|rally practiced among all the Societies of People? For let them differ about what they will el&s;e, they pretty generally agree about this. To which Objection I An&s;wer, That if they did but as well agree about all other Points as they do about this, they might almo&s;t if not altogether be ter|med one Community, yet I cannot find this to be a Proof: For I take it for a Maxim, that in a general way, the Negroes are cruelly us'd; and therefore I do not find, that their Agree|ment in making Slaves can be an Example for us, any more than their u&s;ing them cruelly. Therefore if we would but con&s;ider the Thing rightly, we &s;hall not find that to be a Proof, becau&s;e it is &s;o general a Practice. For we may ob&s;erve how it was when our Lord was cruci|fied, that there was divers Sects of People, and of very differing Minds, yet in putting him to Death they could generally agree; and tho'
<PB N="14" REF="003644_0018_10023B6EF248F0A8">
they were &s;o much at Variance, that as the Pro|verb is, they were at Daggers drawing, yet the Text has it, <HI>that the &s;ame Day Pilate and Herod were made Friends.</HI> Yet &s;ome that have Annota|ted thereon&punc; have not &s;crupled to call that a cur&s;ed Friend&s;hip, that was contracted by put|ting to Death our Lord, that came in Love to their Souls. But I have a further Reply to make to what I have &s;aid before, of the general Agreement of making Slaves, <HI>namely,</HI> That there is &s;ome of all Per&s;wa&s;ions, I do believe, that cannot allow of this Practice: For they &s;eeing it to be contrary to Chri&s;t's Command, and even to Nature: For I have made this Ob&s;ervation my &s;elf, (tho' but young in Years) that tho&s;e that dwell neare&s;t the Truth, and contend mo&s;t for it, cannot allow of this Practice, for they &s;ee it to be Oppre&s;&s;ion and Cruelty. But it may be objected, that there hath &s;ome &s;poken again&s;t this Practice, and they have come to no|thing, or have not pro&s;pered in it. To which I An&s;wer, That a good Cau&s;e may be badly ma|naged, and by &s;ad Experience we often &s;ee it is &s;o. Now I do believe by what hath already been &s;aid, that all that have not concluded be|forehand that they would not &s;ee, may &s;ee this Practice of making Slaves to be Antichri&s;tian; for it cannot be of Chri&s;t, becau&s;e contrary to his Command; therefore of Antichri&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="003644_0019_10023B7F24C44AE0">
Now I have heard &s;ome Men &s;ay, that they believe they did wrong in getting Negroes, but that they did not know what to do with them now they had got them; for if they let them go free after &s;ome Time, if any Mi&s;hap betel them, their E&s;tates were obliged to maintain them. And tho' they &s;eem to acknowledge the Wrong done to them, yet they &s;eem to be very much afraid left they &s;hould be forc'd to help them a little, and to &s;eem to re&s;t content|ed.</P>
<P>Now, &s;uppo&s;e that to give the Negroes their Times, or let them go free here in this Coun|try, was wrong, which I do not believe would be wrong, after they had &s;erved them &s;ome time&punc; but if it were wrong to let them go free, whe|ther or no tho&s;e that &s;ee they did wrong in get|ting them, ought not to bear a Te&s;timony a|gain&s;t it? For their keeping them and being &s;ilent, encourages others to get them. For In|&s;tance, the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul'</HI>s Advice to the Be|lievers, not to join them&s;elves in Marriage a Be|liever with an Unbeliever, for he counted it wrong, even &s;o do I: But if a Believer had got a Wife that was an Unbeliever, I do not think that he &s;hould put her away, yet notwith&s;tand|ing the Practice was wrong, and ought to be &s;poken again&s;t. Now I can truly &s;ay, that this Practice of making Slaves of Men, appears to be &s;o great an Evil to me, that for all the Riches

and Glory of this World, I would not be guil|ty of &s;o great a Sin as this &s;eems to be. And I do believe many would &s;ee it &s;o, were they not blinded by Self-Intere&s;t. Now as I &s;aid in the beginning, how apt Men were to forget God in a Time of Liberty, as we now &s;eem to have, which if rightly con&s;idered, we ought the more to remember him, and to pri&s;e his Fa|vour therein. For I do believe it Per&s;ecution was on Foot again, and People were haled to Pri&s;ons, as they have been in Times pa&s;t, that many would have more regard to their own Practices than now they have. For this Prac|tice of making Slaves tends to many Evils, as parting Man and Wife, and Children from them both, and thereby cau&s;ing them to commit A|duitery with others, and &s;o their Children can|not come to honour them. And all this is done by Violence, which is forbidden in the Scriptures; for there we are commanded to do Violence to no Man. And la&s;tly, it is a hin|derance to the &s;preading of the Go&s;pel among tho&s;e poor Creatures, for whom (as well as o|thers) our Lord came and laid down his Life, and al&s;o hath &s;aid, that his Go&s;pel &s;hould be preached unto all Nations. But &s;ome may ob|ject, as I have heard them, that by this Means they come to hear the Go&s;pel preached, and they believed this was the Way our Lord in|tended that Nation &s;hould have the Go&s;pel

preached to them, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> to be brought Slaves here. To which I'll &s;ay, the Reader may quick|ly &s;uppo&s;e what People the&s;e are, for it mu&s;t be them that buy the Go&s;pel pretty dear them|&s;elves, or el&s;e they would not think that the Negroes &s;hould be Bond-Slaves, and their Chil|dren after them, for the Knowledge of the Go&s;|pel. But I do not find that the Go&s;pel was either bought or &s;old for Money; neither do we find that God compelled any to receive it, but only intreated them or advi&s;ed them to chu&s;e Life, and live. Now by this Practice they hate the Name of a Chri&s;tian; for all of us they can get (&s;ay they) they make Slaves of&punc; and even Nature it &s;elf tells them that it is wrong.</P>
<P>Now I would have all &s;eriou&s;ly to con&s;ider, that loves their own Souls, and do believe that they mu&s;t give an Account for the Deeds done in the Body, to look into their own Practices, to &s;ee upon what Foundation they &s;tand; for God will not forgive, what is in our Power to help.</P>
<P>Now I having &s;hewn by Scripture the Un|lawfulne&s;s of this Practice, as it is now in U&s;e, both in the Old Te&s;tament and in the New&punc; And now, I would have all to turn their Minds inward, to that Divine Monitor or Coun&s;ellor, placed in the Heart of Man, which is as agree|able
