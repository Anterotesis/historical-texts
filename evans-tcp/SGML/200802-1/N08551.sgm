<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>IN an age of enquiry into things, it is not to be admired that our great legi&s;lators &s;hould make many new laws well intended for redre&s;&s;ing publick evils, however &s;hort they may fall of it, in the general execution of them: for there is hardly any fence &s;o &s;trong, but the fertile genius of the pre&s;ent times, by its inventions and &s;tratagems, will ea&s;ily break through it.</P>
<P>But I do not here pretend to be a particular advocate, either for or again&s;t the alteration of our laws, any further than as it makes new books nece&s;&s;ary; what I &s;hall now attempt, is to introduce an in&s;tructive treati&s;e, writ in the ea&s;ie&s;t method, and adapted to every capacity, whereby the un&s;kilful, and tho&s;e who are igno|rant in practice of the law, may in &s;ome mea&s;ure be their own advi&s;ers, and readily avoid the common errors too often happening in the pro&s;ecution of &s;uits.</P>
<P>And in this treati&s;e is contained the mo&s;t u&s;eful and requi&s;ite learning in the law, for all degrees of per&s;ons to acquire and un|der&s;tand, there being likewi&s;e many curious things therein not to be found in any other one law book; &s;o that I may venture to &s;ay, the publick will here reap benefit and &s;ecurity to them&s;elves, at the &s;ame time attornies and &s;olicitors confe&s;s it affords a very ju&s;t in&s;truction.</P>
<P>Nor will the&s;e gentlemen, I hope, make any objection to the popularity of my title, &s;ince this work is not de&s;igned to defame or abate the profe&s;&s;ion of the law, tho' it gives &s;ome light into it to the ordinary reader.</P>
<P>This edition has been revi&s;ed and corrected, and many valuable additions in&s;erted from the reports of the late lord chief baron <HI>Comyn;</HI> lord chief ju&s;tice <HI>Raymond; Strange,</HI> ma&s;ter of the rolls; Mr. ju&s;tice <HI>Fo&s;ter, &amp;c. &amp;c.</HI> And al&s;o from the &s;tatute law to the fourth year of the reign of his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty inclu&s;ive.</P>

<P>Action of <HI>Debt</HI> is a &s;uit given by law where a man oweth ano|ther a certain &s;um of money, by obligation, or bargain for a thing &s;old, or by contract, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and the debtor will not pay the debt at the day agreed; then the creditor &s;hall have this action again&s;t him for the &s;ame.</P>
<P>If money be due upon any &s;pecialty, action of debt only lieth; for no other action may be brought for it: and where a man con|tracts to pay money for things which he hath bought, and the &s;el|ler takes bond for the money, the contract is di&s;charged; &s;o that he &s;hall not have action of debt upon the contract, but on the bond. <HI>Nat. Br.</HI> 268.</P>
<P>The u&s;ual action of debt, which con&s;i&s;ts of divers particular branches, lies in all the&s;e ca&s;es:

<PB N="2" REF="010935_0004_0F852D3FF72BCF50">
<ITEM>1. For money due on bond, or bill.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. For rent due from tenants.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. For goods or money delivered.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. For an attorney's expences.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. For permitting a pri&s;oner to e&s;cape.</ITEM>

<P N="1">1. In a bond where &s;everal are bound &s;everally, the obligee may have action of debt again&s;t all the obligors together, or all of them apart, and have &s;everal judgments and executions; though he &s;hall have &s;atisfaction but once: but when the bond is joint, and not &s;everal, all the obligers mu&s;t be &s;ued that are bound; and one is not obliged to an&s;wer without the re&s;t. Al&s;o if a bond is made to three to pay money to one of them, they mu&s;t all join in the acti|on, for they are but as one obligee. <HI>Dy.</HI> 19, 310. <HI>Yelv.</HI> 177.</P>
<P>If there be &s;everal days mentioned for payment of money on a bond, the obligation is no forfeited, nor can be &s;ued until all the days are pa&s;t: yet in &s;ome ca&s;es, the obligee may bring action of debt for the money due by the bond pre&s;ently, though it be not forfeited; and by &s;pecial wording the condition, an obligee may be able to &s;ue the penalty on the fir&s;t default. A man is bound to pay 20 <HI>l.</HI> in manner following, that is to &s;ay, 10<HI>l.</HI> at one day, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">0<HI>l.</HI> at another; debt will not lie till after the la&s;t day, becau&s;e it is an intire duty: but if one binds him&s;elf to pay 10 <HI>l.</HI> on one day, and 10 <HI>l.</HI> on another, after the fir&s;t day action of debt lies for 10 <HI>l.</HI> it being a &s;everal duty. <HI>Co. Lit.</HI> 292. 2 <HI>Danv. Abr.</HI> 501.</P>
<P>In action of debt brought upon a bond again&s;t an heir for the debt of his ance&s;tor, it is not good for the heir to &s;ay, that the ex|ecutors have a&s;&s;ets in their hands; for the obligee may &s;ue either heir or executor: if an heir hath a&s;&s;ets, and the executor al&s;o, it is at the obligee's election to have action of debt again&s;t the one or the other; but he &s;hall not charge them doubly. Debt lies a|gain&s;t the heir of an obligor, who has lands by de&s;cent, if the ex|ecutors have not &s;ufficient: and if an heir has made over lands fallen to him by de&s;cent, execution &s;hall be had again&s;t him to the value of the land, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> if it be not &s;old <HI>bona fide</HI> before the action brought. <HI>Dy.</HI> 204. <HI>Plowd.</HI> 433. <HI>Ander.</HI> 7. <HI>Stat.</HI> 3 <HI>&amp;</HI> 4 <HI>W. &amp; M. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">.</HI> 14. perpetuated by 6 <HI>&amp;</HI> 7 <HI>W.</HI> 3. <HI>c.</HI> 14.</P>
<P>Action of debt lieth on a recognizance; &s;o upon a &s;tatute mer|chant, being in the nature of a bond or obligation: but it is other|wi&s;e in ca&s;e of a &s;tatute &s;taple. A man owes another a &s;um of mo|ney, and hath his note under hand, without &s;eal, an action of debt on a <HI>mutuatus</HI> lies; but the defendant may wage his law: in action

<P>If debt is brought on a &s;ingle bill, the defendant may plead pay|ment, before the action brought, in bar&punc; and pending an action on bond, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> the defendant may bring in principal, intere&s;t and co&s;ts; and the court &s;hall give judgment to di&s;charge the defendant, by &s;tat. 4 <HI>Ann. c.</HI> 16. <HI>&s;.</HI> 13.</P>

<P>An executor brought error on a judgment again&s;t the te&s;tator upon bond: and after affirmance moved on &s;tat. 4 <HI>Ann. c.</HI> 16. <HI>&s;ect.</HI> 13. to pay principal, intere&s;t and co&s;ts, it was in&s;i&s;ted, that as he came for a favour to &s;ave the penalty, it was but equitable he &s;hould pay the co&s;ts in error which he had put the plaintiff to; for if plaintiff had taken execution, equity would never puni&s;h him for taking tho&s;e expences out of the penalty.</P>
<P>On the other &s;ide were cited <HI>Baynham</HI> v. <HI>Matthews,</HI> 2 <HI>Str.</HI> 871. where an executor di&s;continued without co&s;ts. 2 <HI>Kel.</HI> 70. <HI>pl.</HI> 28. S.P. 2 <HI>Barnard. K. B.</HI> 154. S.C. S.P. and <HI>Sidney</HI> v. <HI>Newin&s;on.</HI> Upon the authority of which ca&s;e, the court determined, that as by law the executor was not to pay co&s;ts upon a writ of error, a court of law could not direct them to be taxed, though there was a penal|ty. 2 <HI>Str.</HI> 1072.</P>
<P>The ca&s;e of <HI>Sidney</HI> v. <HI>Newin&s;on</HI> was, That plaintiff had brought an action of debt upon bond again&s;t defendant as admini&s;trator, and filed a bill in equity to di&s;cover a&s;&s;ets; and had in&s;tituted a &s;uit in the &s;piritual court, to oblige her to give in an inventory. After judgment for the plaintiff in the action, a writ of error was brought in <HI>K. B.</HI> and the judgment rever&s;ed. Then plaintiff brought a new action in <HI>K. B.</HI> and defendant moved to &s;tay proceedings upon &s;tat. 4 <HI>Ann. c.</HI> 16. <HI>&s;ect.</HI> 13. on paying principal, intere&s;t, and co&s;ts; and now upon motion for the court's direction to the ma&s;ter in tax|ing the co&s;ts, it was in&s;i&s;ted for plaintiff, that defendant ought to pay the whole co&s;ts of the fir&s;t &s;uit, proceedings in <HI>Chancery,</HI> and &s;piritual court.</P>
<P>The court &s;aid, that they had nothing to do to order co&s;ts for
<PB N="4" REF="010935_0005_0F852D4093D1F1B0">
proceedings in another court, which has no power to award co&s;ts, if the party is intitled to them; and as to the judgment that is re|ver&s;ed, there is no rea&s;on for defendant to pay for plaintiff's error and mi&s;take. The court was of opinion, the proceedings in this court mu&s;t be &s;tayed on payment of the co&s;ts of this &s;uit. <HI>Str.</HI> 699.</P>
<P N="2">2. An action of debt lies for rent in arrear, upon a lea&s;e for life or years; at common law it lay not on lea&s;es for life, but now by &s;tatute it may be had. 8 <HI>Ann. c.</HI> 14. If tenant in fee-&s;imple, or fee-tail die, his executor may have action of debt by the &s;tat. 32 <HI>H.</HI> 8. <HI>c.</HI> 37. for arrears of rent incurred in the life-time of &s;uch tenants, or he may di&s;train for the &s;ame; but before this act the executor had no remedy. <HI>Cro. Car.</HI> 471.</P>
<P>The remedy by the common law for rent on a lea&s;e for life was a&s;&s;i&s;e, if the plaintiff had &s;ei&s;in, or by di&s;tre&s;s; and if tenant for life died, his executors might bring action of debt for the rent in arrear: but a new remedy is given by the above &s;tatute, and that is to di&s;train. 3 <HI>Rep.</HI> 65. 3 <HI>Sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">k.</HI> 304.</P>
<P>If a rent or lea&s;e for years of land is re&s;erved and made payable at four quarter-days, the le&s;&s;or may have action of debt after the fir&s;t day of failure; for every quarter's rent is a &s;everal debt, and di&s;tinct actions may be brought for each quarter. 5 <HI>Rep.</HI> 81. 2 <HI>Vent.</HI> 129. An a&s;&s;ignee of rent upon a lea&s;e for years, &s;hall have debt for it: and action of debt will lie again&s;t a le&s;&s;ee, for rent due after the a&s;|&s;ignment of the lea&s;e; for the per&s;onal privity of contract continues, though the privity of e&s;tate is gone: but it is otherwi&s;e, if a landlord once accepts the rent of the a&s;&s;ignee, knowing of the a&s;&s;ignment. <HI>Lev.</HI> 22. 3 <HI>Rep.</HI> 22, 23.</P>
<P>When the lea&s;e is ended, the duty in re&s;pect of the rent remains, and debt lieth by rea&s;on of privity of contract between le&s;&s;or and le&s;&s;ee. <HI>Cro. Jac.</HI> 227.</P>
<P N="3">3. Action of debt lieth upon a parol contract by word only, and &s;o doth action on the ca&s;e: and in &s;ome ca&s;es, debt will lie, al|though there be no contract betwixt the party that brings the acti|on, and him again&s;t whom brought; for there may be a duty crea|ted by law. But action of debt lieth not again&s;t executors, upon a &s;imple contract made by the te&s;tator: though it lies for the ar|rearages of an account again&s;t executors, of receipts by the te&s;tator. 2 <HI>Saund.</HI> 343. 9 <HI>Rep.</HI> 87. <HI>Lil.

<P>If goods or money are delivered to a third per&s;on for my u&s;e, I may have action of debt or account for them. And where money is de|livered to a per&s;on, to be re-delivered again, the property is altered, and debt lies: but where a hor&s;e, or any goods are thus delivered, there action of detinue lieth. Action of debt lies again&s;t the hu&s;|band, for goods which were delivered or &s;old to the wife, if they

come to the hu&s;band's u&s;e: and if one delivers meat, drink or clothes to an infant, and he promi&s;es to pay for them, action of debt or on the ca&s;e will be again&s;t the infant; but what is delivered, mu&s;t be averred to be for the nece&s;&s;ary u&s;e of the infant. 2 <HI>Danv.

<P>There is both common and &s;pecial bail: Common bail is in ac|tions of &s;mall concernment; being called common, becau&s;e any &s;ureties, as <HI>John Doe</HI> and <HI>Richard Roe,</HI> in that ca&s;e are taken; whereas in ca&s;es of greater weight<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> as actions upon bond or &s;peci|alty, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> where the debt amount to 10<HI>l.</HI> or above, (of which an a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">idavit of the debt <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> how to be made) &s;pecial bail or &s;urety mu&s;t be taken, &s;uch as &s;ub&s;idy-men at lea&s;t, and they according to the value. 4 <HI>In&s;t.</HI> 179.</P>
<P>As there are different kinds of bail; &s;o there are divers &s;orts of bail-pieces, <HI>viz.</HI> 1. A common bail-piece, where the defendant is &s;erved with a copy of the proce&s;s; this is merely to bring the de|fendant into court, and is in nature of an appearance in the court of Common Pleas. 2. A &s;pecial bail-piece on a <HI>cepi corpus,</HI> or ar|re&s;t returned, when the defendant is actually arre&s;ted, and the &s;he|riff hath taken a bail-bond. 3. A bail-piece on an <HI>habeas corpus,</HI> in ca&s;e a defendant lives at a great di&s;tance from <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> and a cau&s;e is removed out of an inferior court. 4.

The&s;e bail-pieces, if common, are to be filed in the office within &s;ix days after the end of the term the attorney appears: and &s;pecial bail, which is taken before a judge, or by commi&s;&s;ioners, when accepted, is to be filed; after 20 days notice given of putting in &s;pecial bail before a judge on a <HI>cepi corpus,</HI> if there is no exception, the bail &s;hall be filed in four days.

<P>Bail is not properly &s;uch till it is filed; but it &s;hall be accounted good, till the &s;ame is que&s;tioned and di&s;allowed.

Al&s;o a defendant, with leave of the court, may de|po&s;it money in court in&s;tead of bail: and the court on motion, or a judge at his chamber, will order a common appearance to be taken, when &s;pecial bail is not required. <HI>Lil.

<P>Sheriffs are to let to bail per&s;ons arre&s;ted, upon rea&s;onable &s;ure|ties, having &s;ufficient within the county, to keep their days in &s;uch place, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as the writs require. 23 <HI>H.</HI> 6. <HI>c.</HI> 10.

<P>All <HI>pleadings</HI> are either general or &s;pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters"> a general plea is drawn on a little piece of 3<HI>d.</HI> &s;tamp'd paper, having only the defendant's attorney's name to it, thus: In debt, <HI>He owes nothing;</HI> or if by bond, <HI>'Tis not his deed, &amp;c.</HI> In ca&s;e, <HI>He hath not promi&s;ed:</HI> In tre&s;|pa&s;s, <HI>Not guilty,</HI> &amp;c. And &s;pecial pleas are drawn up in form, &s;et|ting forth the matter pleaded at large, with a proper conclu&s;ion to the declaration or action; and mu&s;t be &s;igned by coun&s;el; they are of two &s;orts, pleas in abatement, and in bar. A plea in abatement begins, <HI>That the defendant ought not to an&s;wer the bill,</HI> &amp;c. And <HI>it</HI> concludes in this form: <HI>Whereupon he prays judgment of the bill, or declaration afore&s;aid,</HI> &amp;c. The plea in bar begins; <HI>That the plaintiff ought not to have or maintain his action:</HI> And concludes to the action, viz. <HI>He prays judgment if he ought to have or maintain his action a|gain&s;t him,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>When a defendant hath pleaded, the plaintiff an&s;wers the de|fendant's plea, which is called a <HI>replication:</HI> This mu&s;t contain certainty, and not vary from the declaration, but mu&s;t pur&s;ue and maintain the cau&s;e of the plaintiff's action; otherwi&s;e it will be a departure in pleading. The defendant an&s;wers the plaintiff's repli|cation by <HI>rejoinder;</HI> and it ought to be a &s;ufficient an&s;wer thereto, and enfore the matter of the bar pleaded; if he departs from the plea, the rejoinder is not good. The plaintiff may an&s;wer the re|joinder by a <HI>&s;urrejoinder;</HI> al&s;o &s;ometimes, though &s;eldom, plead|ings come to <HI>rebutter</HI> in an&s;wer to the &s;urrejoinder, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> A faulty plea in bar, in &s;ome ca&s;es is made good by a replication; and the replication may be allowed good by a rejoinder; but not where they want &s;ub&s;tance. <HI>Co. Lit.</HI> 304.</P>
<P>After all the above pleadings, there may be a <HI>demurrer</HI> in law: And where the defendant has pleaded in abatement, before he pleads directly in bar, he may demur to the plaintiff's declaration; and refer the points of law that ari&s;e thereupon to the judgment of the court, which determines all que&s;tions ari&s;ing on &s;uch demurrers. A demurrer is to be &s;igned, and argued on both &s;ides by coun&s;el; and when it is joined the plaintiff enters it, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and paper books are delivered to the judges: And on a general demurrer, the party confe&s;&s;eth all matters of fact, that are well pleaded. The&s;e de|murrers alledge in&s;ufficiency in law in the other party's declaration, plea, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and if &s;pecial, &s;ay, <HI>That it ought not to be an&s;wered, be|cau&s;e,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>and therefore prays judgment:</HI> And if the matter be found in&s;ufficient, judgment is again&s;t him that joined in the de|murrer;
<PB N="21" REF="010935_0013_0F852D48DC5F36D0">
but if it appear &s;ufficient, judgment is given again&s;t the demurrant. Where the points on a demurrer are apparent and ea&s;y to determine, the court will proceed to give judgment upon it pre&s;ently; but if it be doubtful or difficult, they will take time to con&s;ider thereof, and give a day to the parties: And &s;ometimes all the judges of <HI>England</HI> are con&s;ulted.</P>
<P>By &s;tatute, no dilatory plea &s;hall be received in any court of re|cord, unle&s;s the truth of it be proved by affidavit, or probable matter is &s;hewn: And <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">he cau&s;es of demurrer are to be &s;pecially &s;et down, or the judges &s;hall give judgment without regarding im|perfections in any writ, pleading, &amp;c. &s;o as &s;ufficient matter ap|pears. <HI>Stat.</HI> 4 <HI>Ann. c.</HI> 16.</P>

<P N="1">1. Where any words are maliciou&s;ly &s;poken of another, for which, if true, they would touch his life, or he might be puni&s;h|ed, action of &s;lander lies; as to call a man traitor, robber, felon, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> or charge him with the committing any of the&s;e crimes; or to &s;ay of one, if he might have his will, he would do &s;uch a thing, which thing is actionable. 10 <HI>Rep.</HI> 130. <HI>Dy.</HI> 19.</P>
<P>To reproach a per&s;on with a henious crime, as that he lay in wait to rob or murder any one; to charge a man with a rape, that he did ravi&s;h or was guilty of ravi&s;hing a certain woman; or &s;ay he &s;hould have been hanged for a rape, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and charging one with &s;o|domy or buggery, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> being very penal by the law, for the&s;e acti|on lieth. The charging a per&s;on with &s;tealing things, or as a re|ceiver of &s;tolen goods, are actionable; tho' the words mu&s;t import a certain charge of felony, and not be of cutting and taking away &s;tanding corn, apples from trees, &amp;c. This action of &s;lander may be had for calling a per&s;on a thief; unle&s;s &s;omething of qualifica|tion be coupled to prove the thing no felony: and for con&s;piring to indict a man fal&s;ly and maliciou&s;ly of felony, or other offence, on his acquittal, &amp;c. but not if it appears on the trial there was pro|bable cau&s;e for the indictment. <HI>Rep.</HI> 589. <HI>Bul&s;t.</HI> 112.</P>
<P>For &s;aying of another, that he hath killed, or concealed the murder of a &s;uch a man, action lies; but the defendant may &s;hew that the party is or was alive at the &s;peaking of the words, and then no action will lie thereon. To &s;ay of one formerly that he

For &s;aying one is a pirate, or maintainer of pirates, action of &s;lan|der lieth; and &s;o it is to &s;ay of a man, that he did burn a dwelling-hou&s;e, or a barn with corn, &amp;c. <HI>Dy.</HI> 236. <HI>Brownl.</HI> 15. 2 <HI>Bul&s;t.</HI> 134. <HI>Yelv.</HI> 154.</P>
<P>Such words as charge a per&s;on with forgery of fal&s;e deeds, or with perjury, bribery, extortion, maintenance, &amp;c. all which are puni&s;hable by the common and &s;tatute laws, and affect a man's li|berty and e&s;tate; for the&s;e words an action of &s;lander may be bro't. If one &s;ay of a per&s;on, that he could prove him perjured in a court of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">cord; or call him perjur'd knave, action lies; &s;o where a man &s;ays he gave another money for for&s;wearing him&s;elf; and when the words charge the party with &s;ubornation of perjury. <HI>Brownl.</HI> 18. 3 <HI>In&s;t.</HI> 163. <HI>Danv.

<P N="2">2.

<P>If one &s;ay, that an alehou&s;e-keeper keeps a bawdy-hou&s;e, action lieth; but to &s;ay an inn-keeper harbours rogues, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> is not action|able, for his hou&s;e is common to all gue&s;ts. For calling a man&punc; whore-ma&s;ter, or a woman whore, except in <HI>London</HI> by the cu&s;tom of the city, no action lieth: tho' to &s;ay of a man that he is a com|mon whore-ma&s;ter, and lay with a certain woman, and is a drunken

<P N="3">3.

<P>As to &s;lander of per&s;ons, tho' &s;candalous words are &s;poken before a man's face, or behind his back, by way of affirmation, or report, in je&s;t or earne&s;t, when &s;ober or drunk, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> they are actionable; and &s;o it is if the words are &s;poke directly or indirectly, or obliquely; and tho' they are pronounced in any language, if under&s;tood: but where they can have a double interpretation, they &s;hall be taken in the milde&s;t &s;en&s;e, that no action &s;hall lie. 4 <HI>Rep.</HI> 14. <HI>Hob.</HI> 236. <HI>Cro.

<P>In this Action no arre&s;t is to be made, as commonly pro&s;ecuted; only a declaration in ejectment, &amp;c. And if it appears that the plaintiff was ejected after the lea&s;e made, it is &s;ufficient, tho' no certain day be alledged in which it was done; the day is not ma|terial, being before the Action brought: but the time of entry of plaintiff mu&s;t be &s;hewn, that it may appear he was not a di&s;&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">i&s;or, by entering on the lands before the commencement of his term, &amp;c.

<P>The action of ejectment is now made &s;hort and ea&s;y; for there is no occa&s;ion for a lea&s;e to be made and delivered upon the pre|mi&s;es to the le&s;&s;ee, and ou&s;ter and ejectment of him as formerly, unle&s;s there be no tenants in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, &amp;c. but in&s;tead of the old way of &s;ealing a lea&s;e on the premi&s;es, the cour&s;e is to draw a de|claration, feigning a lea&s;e for years to him that would try the title, and a ca&s;ual ejector or defendant, who is generally &s;ome friend of the plaintiff's; the declaration is delivered to the ejector named, and he &s;erves a copy of it on the tenant in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, or his wife, and give notice at the bottom for him to appear and defend his title, or that he the feigned defendant will &s;uffer judgment by de|fault; whereby the true tenant will be turned out of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion: to this declaration, the tenant appears by attorney, and con&s;ents to a rule to be made defendant, in the place of the a&s;ual ejector, and to confe&s;s lea&s;e, entry and ou&s;ter, and at the trial &s;tand upon the title only; and then the new defendant is put into the declaration, and his attorney pleads not guilty; whereupon the cau&s;e proceeds to i&s;&s;ue, &amp;c.

<P>A plaintiff in this action recovers according to the right which he hath at the time of bringing the action; and one that hath title to the land in que&s;tion, may on motion be made a defendant with the tenant in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, to defend his title: and the landlord may be made defendant by the tenant, with con&s;ent of &s;uch landlord. For as the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the land is primarily in que&s;tion, and to be recovered, that concerns the tenant; and the title of the land, which is tried collaterally, is concerning &s;ome other, who may be admitted a defendant with &s;uch tenant: though none other &s;hall be admitted, but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">hat hath been in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, or receives the rents of the lands. <HI>Nel&s;.

<P>Order made by two ju&s;tices, reciting that a complaint had been made to them in writing, by <HI>A. Clavey</HI> again&s;t <HI>J.

examined the witne&s;&s;es produced by the &s;aid <HI>A.

Given under our hands and &s;eals this 5th day of <HI>January</HI> 1756. This order was affirm|ed by the &s;e&s;&s;ions upon appeal. Both the orders were removed by <HI>certiorari</HI> into the King's Bench. It was moved to qua&s;h the &s;ame. Objections taken: 1. The complaint is &s;aid to be taken in wri|ting, but not upon oath. 2. It is only &s;aid, that he demi&s;ed to <HI>W. Thatcher;</HI> but not &s;aid for what e&s;tate or term. 3. It is &s;tated, &s;o much due for rent, but not &s;aid for what term: it might be due twenty years ago. It is not &s;tated to be due when <HI>Thatcher</HI> moved the goods. 4. The words of the order are, goods and <HI>cattle;</HI> of the &s;tatute goods and <HI>chattels.</HI> 5. No certain time is alledged when the defendant aided and a&s;&s;i&s;ted; only &s;aid on or about the 26th, 27th, or 28th of <HI>Augu&s;t.</HI> 6, Not &s;tated that <HI>Thatcher</HI> did carry off his goods: only that <HI>Bi&s;&s;ex</HI> did aid and a&s;&s;i&s;t him in carry|ing them off. 7. They adjudge the complaint true, but do not &s;tate the evidence, and this is a conviction, not an order: and for any thing that appears, it might be upon <HI>Clavey'</HI>s evidence a|lone. 8. It is not &s;tated that the goods were under the value of 50 <HI>l.</HI> which is the ground of the ju&s;tices juri&s;diction. 9. The words of the &s;tatute are, if any per&s;on &s;hall be a tenant of any lands, tenements, or hereditaments: the word u&s;ed in the order is e&s;tate, which may be a thing incorporeal, or may mean the in|tere&s;t in the land, and &s;o not within the &s;tatute. 10. It &s;hall ap|pear, whether the landlord has a right to di&s;train: by 8 <HI>An. c.</HI> 14. the landlord may di&s;train at any time within &s;ix months after the expiration of the term: it doth not appear the&s;e &s;ix months were not expired, and if they were, this is no offence. After con&s;idera|tion, Mr. Ju&s;tice <HI>Deni&s;on</HI> delivered the re&s;olution of the court: I think the mo&s;t material objection is, whether this is an order or a conviction. If a conviction, the evidence ought to have been &s;et out. And there has been no doubt (notwith&s;tanding the ca&s;e of
<PB N="66" REF="010935_0036_0F852D60769ADDD8">
<HI>K.</HI> and <HI>Pullein<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, Salk.</HI> 369.) that in a conviction the evidence mu&s;t be &s;et out, that the court may judge upon it. So it was held by Lord <HI>Hardwicke</HI> in the ca&s;e of <HI>K.</HI> and <HI>Lloyd.</HI> 2 <HI>Stra.</HI> 996. 2 <HI>Barnard K. B.</HI> 302, 310, 338, 466. <HI>Se&s;&s;. Ca&s;.</HI> 223 <HI>pl.</HI> 190. and in that ca&s;e it was objected, that as it &s;ubjectd the party to a pe|nalty, though in the &s;tatute it was called an order, yet it &s;hould be con&s;trued as a conviction: but the court &s;aid, every act of the ju&s;tices, which &s;ubjects the party to a penalty, &s;hall not be con|&s;trued as a conviction. <HI>K.</HI> and <HI>Venables.

M.</HI> 4 <HI>Geo.</HI> which the court &s;aid was a &s;trong ca&s;e, and mu&s;t be con&s;idered as an order. I under&s;tood from my Lord <HI>Hardwicke,</HI> in the ca&s;e of <HI>K.</HI> and <HI>Lloyd,</HI> that his ground of the difference was founded upon the expre&s;&s;ions of the &s;tatute, and not upon the penalty; as where the words of the &s;tatute are, "of which he &s;hall be convicted," it is to be con|&s;trued as a conviction. Here it is extremely &s;trong; the &s;tatute calls it an order: and in the nature of it, it is an examination upon a complaint. If the party was never &s;ummoned, this court upon affidavit will grant information again&s;t the ju&s;tices: but the &s;um|mons need not be &s;et out; and the court will intend the ju&s;tices have done right, in ca&s;e the contrary does not appear upon the face of the order. As to the fir&s;t objection: this is not an infor|mation, but a complaint: when the party is &s;ummoned, the wit|ne&s;&s;es are to be examined upon oath, but the complaint need not be upon oath. In an&s;wer to the &s;econd objection: as the order has followed the words of the &s;tatute, we will not intend it a ca&s;e wherein the ju&s;tices had not a juri&s;diction. The court will not, in ca&s;e of an order, intend that the ju&s;tices have done wrong. As to the third objection: it is &s;ufficiently alledged in an order; his a&s;&s;i&s;ting the tenant to carry away the goods, as it is here alledged, is &s;ufficient, the rent continued then to be in arrear; and the rather as the defendant might have availed him&s;elf of the rent paid, by proving it before the ju&s;tices. I much doubt, whether in a decla|ration it would not be &s;ufficient to &s;ay, the rent was in arrear at &s;uch a day; and I think it would lie upon the defendant to prove that the rent does not remain in arrear. As to its not being &s;aid, for what time the rent was due; this is mere matter of form. As to the fifth objection: <HI>about,</HI> in common parlance, means in this ca&s;e three days or near it. They might be three days in carrying the goods away. The days are not material, even in legal pro|ceedings. Ld. <HI>Raym.</HI> 581. and in the ca&s;e of <HI>K.</HI> and <HI>Simp&s;on, H.</HI> 3 <HI>Geo. Stra.</HI> 46. the day and hour in a conviction are not material.
<PB N="67" REF="010935_0036_0F852D60769ADDD8">
By this &s;tatute no time is limited, when the complaint &s;hall be made: it may be made at any time. Suppo&s;e the defendant had paid the penalty on a different complaint made, he might ea&s;ily have &s;hewn it. As to the &s;ixth, the an&s;wer is obvious; if <HI>Thatcher</HI> had not carried his goods away, the defendant could not have aided in carrying them. The &s;tatute makes two offences, one carrying the goods away; the other, aiding in carrying them a|way. It is only nece&s;&s;ary here to &s;tate the offence which the de|fendant had been guilty of, which this order does in the words of the &s;tatute. In the ca&s;e of <HI>K.</HI> and <HI>Monk, M.</HI> 13 <HI>Geo.</HI> 2. there was a conviction for aiding and a&s;&s;i&s;ting in killing a buck. It was ob|jected, that it was not charged the buck was killed. But the court held, that as the conviction was in the words of the &s;tatute, it was &s;ufficient; and the court held they were all principals, as well tho&s;e that killed the buck, as tho&s;e that a&s;&s;i&s;ted. And this was the ca&s;e of a conviction. All the other objections may have this general an&s;wer; that in the ca&s;e of orders, where the ju&s;tices have juri&s;diction, we will intend they have acted right; and if they have done wrong, they may be puni&s;hed by an information.

But in pro&s;ecuting cau&s;es, if the par|ties de&s;cend to i&s;&s;ue, this court cannot try it by jury; but the re|cord is to be &s;ent into the King's Bench, and try'd there, and af|terwards remanded into the Chancery: though if there be a de|murrer in law, it &s;hall be argued and adjudged here.

<P>By the Common law, every &s;heriff ought to make his turn or circuit throughout all the hundreds in his county, in order to hold a court in every hundred for the redre&s;&s;ing of common grivances, and pre&s;ervation of the peace, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and the turn is the king's leet thro' all the county; it being a court of record, of which the &s;heriff is judge: al&s;o before the courts at <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter</HI> were erected, the coun|ty-courts were the chief courts of the kingdom. <HI>Glanvil, lib.</HI> 1. <HI>cap.</HI> 2, 3. <HI>Fleta, lib.</HI> 2. <HI>c.</HI> 62.</P>

1. Trial, in its common definition, is the examination of a cau&s;e civil or criminal, before a judge, who has juri&s;diction to try it according to the laws of the land. And the mo&s;t general rule has been, that every trial &s;hall be out of that town, precinct, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> with|in which the matter of fact triable is alledged, or the neare&s;t thereunto, for the better cognizance of the fact committed. <HI>Co. Lit.</HI> 125.</P>
<P>All trials for murder mu&s;t be had in the county where the fact was done: but if the &s;troke is in one county, and the death in ano|ther, the indictment may be found by the jury of the county where the party died; and there the matter be tried as well as if the &s;troke had been in the &s;ame county: and when an indictment is found again&s;t a per&s;on in the proper county, it may be heard and determined in any other county by &s;pecial commi&s;&s;ion, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> In a civil ca&s;e, if a foreign i&s;&s;ue which is local &s;hould happen, it may be tried where the action is laid; and for that purpo&s;e the plaintiff may enter a &s;ugge&s;tion on the roll, that &s;uch a place in &s;uch a county is next adjacent; and it &s;hall be tried in the court of <HI>B. R.</HI> by a jury from that place, according to the laws of that country, which may be given in evidence. 3 <HI>In&s;t.</HI> 27. <HI>Cro.

<P>Where civil cau&s;es are grown to i&s;&s;ue, if they are to be tried in <HI>London</HI> or <HI>Middle&s;ex,</HI> and the defendant lives not forty miles from <HI>London,</HI> in that ca&s;e eight days notice of trial mu&s;t be given the defendant; and if he live that di&s;tance from <HI>London,</HI> or further off, he mu&s;t have fourteen days notice from the plaintiff, before he try his cau&s;e. But at the <HI>a&s;&s;izes</HI> eight days notice of trial is good, let the defendant live where he will; and if the defendant go to trial without &s;ufficient notice given him, the trial is not binding. A defendant, on due notice given, mu&s;t go to trial, or judgment will pa&s;s again&s;t him by default: and where the plaintiff will not try his cau&s;e in &s;uch time as he ought to do, by the rules of the court; the defendant may give a rule and notice for trying the cau&s;e by <HI>provi&s;o,</HI> and &s;o di&s;charge him&s;elf of the action. 2 <HI>Lil.

<P>In ca&s;e the court &s;ees that one of the parties is &s;urpri&s;ed, through &s;ome ca&s;ualty, without any fault of his own, they may at their di&s;cretion put off the trial to another time, until &s;uch party is bet|ter prepared: al&s;o if a defendant is not ready to try his cau&s;e, on pe|tition, and affidavit of the rea&s;ons, the judge will order it to be &s;tay|ed till another day the &s;ame a&s;&s;izes; and in <HI>London</HI> until the next term, on payment of co&s;ts. A cau&s;e is to be entered in the judge's book two days before the time of trial, or it &s;hall not be &s;et down to be try'd that term; and if the i&s;&s;ue is not joined between the plain|tiff

and defendant, which con&s;i&s;ts of an affirmative on the one part and a denial of the charge on the other part, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> it will not be a good trial. 2 <HI>Lil. Abr.</HI> 609.</P>
<P N="2">2. To proceed to trial in the courts at <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> after the till or writ i&s;&s;ued and executed again&s;t the defendant, and appear|ance thereupon made by him, the declaration is to be drawn and delivered with an imparlance to the defendant's attorney; and it mu&s;t be entered that term on the prothonotary's roll, and docquet|ted: the term following the plaintiff's attorney gives a rule with the &s;econdary for the defendant to plead by &s;uch a day, or the plain|tiff to have judgment; and the defendant having pleaded to the plaintiff's action and declaration, according to the ca&s;e, &s;o that the parties are at i&s;&s;ue, the attorney for the plaintiff makes a co|py of the i&s;&s;ue, and gives it to the defendant's attorney, with notice of trial; in order to which, the <HI>venire facias</HI> mu&s;t be made out and returned by the &s;heriff, and after is &s;ued forth the <HI>habeas corpora</HI> to bring in the jury, and the record is made up; whereupon a trial is had, and a verdict being brought in by the jury, judgment is given accordingly, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>But if the defendant do not plead, but lets it go by default, then upon entering judgment, a writ of inquiry of damages is to be award|ed, returnable the next term, of the execution, whereof notice is to be given the defendant's attorney; which being executed, with the damages in&s;erted in a &s;chedule annexed to the writ, and re|turned by the &s;heriff to the prothonotary's office, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and on a rule being given upon it, he taxes co&s;ts: then it is carried to the clerk of the judgments, and on giving him the number, roll, and term that the judgment was entered, he will make out a writ of execution, either a <HI>capias ad &s;atisfaciendum</HI> or <HI>fieri facias,</HI> for the damages and co&s;ts.</P>
<P N="3">3. In the proceedings to trial at the <HI>a&s;&s;i&s;es,</HI> when any cau&s;e comes on, a <HI>di&s;tringas</HI> of the jury is to be fir&s;t returned by the &s;he|riff, and then the record mu&s;t be delivered to the judge's mar&s;hal; upon which, the coun&s;el being in&s;tructed with their briefs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and all parties ready, the mar&s;hal gives the record to the judge, and the cryer calls over the names of the jury, and when they are &s;worn, being fir&s;t elected by ballot, they are bid to &s;tand together, and hear their charge; which done, the coun&s;el on both &s;ides open the ca&s;e, fir&s;t of the &s;ide of the plaintiff, as the proof lies on him, and looking over their <HI>Breviates</HI> argue the matter in conte&s;t, pro|ducing the witne&s;&s;es to prove what they aledge; and then the judge &s;ums up the evidence, and gives it in charge to the jury, to do impartially therein: at which time the clerk of a&s;&s;i&s;e, or his a&s;&s;ociate, files the writ, panel and record together, and makes a

copy of the jury's names, and of the i&s;&s;ue they are to try, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> delivers to the jury; and a bailiff being &s;worn to keep them with|out meat, drink, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> they are then kept together till they all agree on the verdict.</P>
<P>The jury, when they are agreed, return to give in their verdict&punc; and the plaintiff is then called; and if he do not appear, a non&s;uit &s;hall be recorded, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> but if he appears, the clerk a&s;ks the jury who they find for, and what co&s;ts, and damages, and &s;o enters it on the back of the panel, and repeats it to the jury, which fini&s;hed the trial: and after that is over, the a&s;&s;ociate delivers to the plain|tiff's attorney the record with the <HI>di&s;tringas,</HI> and the names of the jury annexed, on the back of which he writes the &s;ub&s;tance of the verdict; then upon the back of the record is ingro&s;&s;ed the <HI>po&s;tea,</HI> (that afterwards the plaintiff and defendant came before &s;uch a judge, and the jury was elected and &s;worn, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and found &s;uch verdict and co&s;ts, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>) and after it is to be carried to the clerk of the <HI>po&s;tea's</HI> to be marked, and then 'tis delivered to the clerk of the rules, and he makes a four-days rule for judgment; which rule be|ing out, if judgment be not arre&s;ted, the record is to be carried to the ma&s;ter of the office, who will tax further co&s;ts, when the judgment is fit to be entered, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>And in trials at the a&s;&s;i&s;es, the record and <HI>di&s;tringas</HI> are generally kept by the a&s;&s;ociate till the next term, and he indor&s;es the <HI>po&s;tea,</HI> receiving his fee for it at the trial; and then he is to be called upon for the &s;ame, and you proceed to have it marked, take out a rule, and &s;ign judgment, as before is directed, and the judgment mu&s;t be entered on a roll: al&s;o if a trial is had the la&s;t day of term, or at the &s;ittings after, or the a&s;&s;i&s;es, judgment cannot be given thereupon until the fir&s;t day of the next term; and judgment being entered, execution is awarded, and writs of <HI>capias ad &s;atisfaciendum, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. There may be new trials granted, in &s;everal ca&s;es; as where &s;ufficient notice was not given the defendant of the former trial; if exce&s;&s;ive damages are a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the jury; or a verdict is given again&s;t evidence; and when there was any fraud, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But gene|rally a new trial &s;hall not be had for two &s;mall damages, except action of covenant is brought for a &s;um certain, and the jury give damages under that, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and it &s;hould not be granted for want of any evidence at a former trial, that the party might then have pro|duced, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> 2 <HI>Salk.</HI> 647.</P>

<P>In this deed the per&s;on as gives is called the donor, and he to whom the thing is given is called the donee, and in like manner there is grantor and grantee, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The deed mu&s;t have apt words to de&s;cribe and &s;et forth the per&s;ons of the donor and donee, that they be duly named, and al&s;o the thing given, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and all nece&s;&s;a|ry circum&s;tances, as &s;ealing and delivery, and livery of &s;ei&s;in are to be ob&s;erved; and if a deed of gift, or any other deed, be pro|cured by dure&s;s of impri&s;onment of the party that makes it, for this it may be made void. <HI>Perk.

<P>A deed of gift is good without any con&s;ideration; and a gift may be upon condition: but great care mu&s;t be taken that there be no fraud in the ca&s;e; for if a deed of gift and conveyance of lands is made with intent to defraud a purcha&s;er upon good con&s;ideration, as again&s;t &s;uch purcha&s;er it &s;hall be void, and parties ju&s;tifying the &s;ame to be <HI>bona fide</HI> made, &s;hall forfeit a year's value of the lands, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And &s;o it is if any deed of gift or grant, be made to defeat creditors of their ju&s;t debts, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The &s;tatute makes the deed void, again&s;t &s;uch creditors; but not again&s;t the party him&s;elf, his exe|cutors or admini&s;trators, again&s;t whom it remains good. <HI>Co.

<P>If lands are granted by deed, the hou&s;es which &s;tand thereon will pa&s;s; for hou&s;es and mills pa&s;s by the grant of all lands, as land is the mo&s;t durable thing on which they are built.

Now this act appoints the apportioning the rent, and gives the remedy. But there are two de&s;criptions of the per&s;on, to who&s;e executors the remedy is given; in the preamble, it is one having only an e&s;tate for life; in the enacting part, it is tenant for life; now tenant in tail comes expre&s;ly within the mi&s;|chief.

<P>The con&s;truction of wills is more favoured in law than any o|ther deed or conveyance, to fulfil the intent of the te&s;tator: be|cau&s;e the te&s;tator is &s;uppo&s;ed to be <HI>inops con&s;ilii,</HI> and in a hurry, and a devi&s;e is not a conveyance by common Law, but by the &s;ta|tute: the devi&s;es before the &s;tatute were by cu&s;tom, and as cu&s;tom enabled men to di&s;po&s;e of their e&s;tates contrary to the common law; &s;o it exempted this kind of conveyance from the regularity and propriety required in other conveyances; and thus it came to pa&s;s that wills upon the &s;tatute, in imitation of tho&s;e by cu&s;tom, gained &s;uch favourable con&s;truction.

<P>An infant makes his will for lands, and when of age he declares it as his will, yet it is void; but an infant at fourteen years old may make a will of his goods and chattels.

<P>A te&s;tator devi&s;ed by will all his lands, tenements and e&s;tate what&s;oever, whereof he &s;hould be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed at the time of his death; and after this he purcha&s;ed lands, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and it was held, that a devi&s;e of per&s;onal things was good, tho' the te&s;tator had them not at the time of the will; but a chattel real, as a lea&s;e for years, doth not pa&s;s: and a devi&s;e of lands is not good, if the te&s;tator at that time had nothing in them.

<P>The devi&s;e of all a man's inheritance carries a fee-&s;imple: al&s;o lands given to a per&s;on to di&s;po&s;e of at plea&s;ure, makes a fee.

<P>A devi&s;e to a man and his heirs male makes an e&s;tate tail; tho' &s;uch a gift in any common conveyance would be a fee-&s;imple, it not being &s;aid of what body.

Land given to a man who &s;hall marry my daugh|ter, or to a man and his children, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> is certain enough: but a condition in a will, that one &s;hall not marry &s;uch a per&s;on, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> is unlawful and void: if a legacy or portion is given to a woman, provided &s;he marries not without con&s;ent of another, it is only <HI>in terrorem;</HI> unle&s;s the portion on &s;uch marriage be limited over to &s;ome other per&s;on.

<P>A per&s;on may at any time &s;ell his goods, even though an exe|cution be coming out again&s;t him; unle&s;s there is a private tru&s;t between the parties, and the writ of execution is delivered to the &s;heriff, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And where a bargain is, that one &s;hall give me &s;o much for a hor&s;e, and he gives one &s;hilling or a penny in earne&s;t, which I accept, this is a perfect &s;ale. <HI>Noy Max.</HI> 87.</P>
<P>Where one agrees for goods &s;old, the buyer mu&s;t not carry them away before paid for; except a day of payment is allowed him by the &s;eller.

<P>A &s;ale of goods upon a <HI>Sunday,</HI> tho' in a fair or market, will not alter the property: and in markets, all contracts for any thing &s;old there, to make them binding, are to be made as follows: the &s;ale is to be in a place that is open, and in a proper place for &s;uch goods; it mu&s;t be a &s;ale for valuable con&s;ideration, and the buyer is not to know that the &s;eller hath a wrongful po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; the &s;ale not to be fraudulently betwixt two, to bar another; there is to be a &s;ale and a contract, by per&s;ons able to contract, and the

<P N="2">2. A gift of goods is made either by deed, by word, or in law: and all goods and chattels per&s;onal may be given without deed, ex|cept in &s;ome &s;pecial ca&s;es. <HI>Perk.</HI> 57.</P>
<P>But a general gift of all a man's goods without any exception, though this be by deed, it is liable to &s;u&s;picion as fraudulent, to deceive creditors: and therefore whenever any gift &s;hall be made, in &s;atisfaction of debt, it is good to make it in a publick manner before neighbours; that the goods and chattels be apprai&s;ed to the value, and the gift expre&s;ly made in &s;atisfaction of the debt; and that on the gift of the goods the donee take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of them, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> 4 <HI>Rep.</HI> 80. <HI>Hob.</HI> 230.</P>
<P>As to gifts by word, if a man intending to give a jewel to one, &s;ay to him, here I give you my ring, with the ruby in it, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and with his own hand delivers it to the party; it would be a good gift, notwith&s;tanding the ring &s;hould bear any other jewel, being delivered by the party him&s;elf to the party to whom given. Here a gift of any thing without con&s;ideration, will be good; but it is revokable before the delivery to the donee of the thing given: and in ca&s;e I give to you one of my hor&s;es in my &s;table, there you &s;hall have your election to chu&s;e which you will. <HI>Bac. Max.</HI> 87. <HI>Jenk. Cent.</HI> 109. <HI>Co. Lit.</HI> 145.</P>
<P>The gift in law is when a man is married to a woman, the law gives all the goods of the wife to the hu&s;band by the mar|riage; and if a per&s;on be made executor of a will, on his taking upon him the executor&s;hip, the law gives and transfers the pro|perty of the te&s;tator's goods to &s;uch executor: though in the&s;e ca&s;es, it is as it were conditional; for the hu&s;band is liable to the debts of the wife, and the executor to the debts of the te&s;tator. <HI>Co.

<P>It is the &s;ame where one takes my goods as a tre&s;pa&s;&s;er, and I in action recover damages for them; the law gives him the pro|perty of the goods, he having paid for them. 2 <HI>Shep. Abr.</HI> 266.</P>

<P N="3">3. Agreement is the mutual con&s;ent of parties, or joining toge|ther of two or more minds, in any thing done, or to be done.

A covenant is an agreement made by deed in writing, between two or more, to do or not to do &s;ome act agreed upon betwixt them. <HI>Terms de Ley</HI> 32, 459.</P>
<P>Agreements are either executed already at the beginning, or executory, to be performed <HI>in futuro;</HI> and are governed by the intention of the parties: they ought to be perfect, full and com|pleat, &s;o as to be executed with a recompence; or give an action or other remedy for it. An agreement without &s;atisfaction is as no|thing; and a forced agreement of the party is accounted no agree|ment; therefore he that did agree to the thing &s;hall not be com|pelled to perform it. <HI>Plowd.</HI> 290. 2 <HI>Mod.</HI> 8. <HI>Cro.

to covenant. And a covenant is either in fact, or in law: in fact is that which is expre&s;ly agreed between the parties, and in|&s;erted in the deed; and in law is that covenant which the law in|tends and implies, though it be not expre&s;&s;ed in words. A &s;ervant covenants and agrees to &s;erve me a year, and I covenant to pay him a &s;um of money for it; here he may have an action again&s;t me, although he do not &s;erve me; but then I may oblige him to &s;erve out the time. <HI>Lev.</HI> 155. <HI>Co.

<P>A covenant is no duty 'till broken: in covenants the la&s;t words, that are general, &s;hall be expounded by the fir&s;t words which are &s;pecial and particular: and if &s;ome covenants in a deed are good and lawful, and others not; tho&s;e again&s;t law are void, and the other &s;hall &s;tand good. 2 <HI>Ventr.</HI> 218. <HI>Plowd.</HI> 287. 11 <HI>Rep.</HI> 27.</P>

<P N="1">1. Elopement is where a woman that is married of her own ac|cord goes away and departs from her hu&s;band, and lives with an adulterer.</P>
<P>A woman thus leaving her hu&s;band is &s;aid to elope; and in this ca&s;e the hu&s;band is not obliged to allow her any alimony or main|tenance out of his e&s;tate; nor &s;hall he be chargeable for nece&s;&s;a|ries for her, as wearing apparel, diet, lodging, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And where the &s;ame is notorious, whoever gives her credit, doth it at his pe|ril: but on an elopement, the putting a wife in the <HI>Gazette,</HI> or other news papers, is no legal notice to per&s;ons in general not to tru&s;t her; though per&s;onal notice to particular per&s;ons given by the hu&s;band will be good, not to be chargeable to them. <HI>Rol.

<P>If a woman elopes, and the hu&s;band gives publick notice of it, and declares he will not pay any debts of hers &s;he contracts; it hath been held, that if per&s;ons tru&s;t her afterwards the hu&s;band is not liable to &s;atisfy the debt: yet according to the opinion of chief ju&s;tice <HI>Holt,</HI> if a wife run away from her hu&s;band, and contract debts, and afterwards the hu&s;band comes after her and lies with her, though but for a night; that will make him chargeable for the debts of the wife. <HI>Sid.</HI> 109. <HI>Mod.

<P N="1">1. Ba&s;tardy &s;ignifies a defect of birth, objected to one born out of wedlock: for a ba&s;tard is he that is born of any woman not married, &s;o that his father is not known by the order of law; and therefore he &s;hall not be heir, or of kin to any per&s;on; he being
<PB N="215" REF="010935_0110_0F852C06650B13F8">
the fir&s;t of his family; nor &s;hall he have heirs, but of his own body.</P>
<P>A woman is with child by a man, who afterwards marries her, and then the child is born; the child is not a ba&s;tard: but if a man hath i&s;&s;ue by a woman before marriage, and after they marry, the i&s;&s;ue is a ba&s;tard by our law; but legitimate by the civil law. In ca&s;e one marries a wowan gro&s;ly big with child by another, and within three days after &s;he is delivered, in our law the i&s;&s;ue is no ba&s;tard; 'tis otherwi&s;e by the &s;piritual law: and where a child is born within a day after marriage between parties of full age, if there be no apparent impo&s;&s;ibility that the hu&s;band &s;hould be the father of it, the child is not a ba&s;tard, but &s;uppo&s;ed to be the hu&s;band's child. 2 <HI>In&s;t.</HI> 96. <HI>Danv.

<P>But if the hu&s;band be but eight or nine years of age, or if he be within the age of fourteen, the i&s;&s;ue is a ba&s;tard: &s;o where a hu&s;band is gelt, or hath lo&s;t his genitals, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which &s;hews an im|po&s;&s;ibility to get a child; but it mu&s;t be by &s;pecial matter. By the common law, if the hu&s;band be within the four &s;eas, &s;o that by intendment he may conver&s;e with his wife, and the wife hath i&s;|&s;ue, the child will not be a ba&s;tard: but he is a ba&s;tard who is born of a woman when her hu&s;band is over &s;ea, at and from the time of the begetting to the birth of &s;uch child. Where a woman lives in adultery with another, her children by &s;uch other are ba|&s;tards; for they are born out of the limits of matrimony; though if hu&s;band and wife con&s;ent to live &s;eparate, the children born after &s;uch &s;eparation &s;hall be taken to be legitimate, and not ba|&s;tards, becau&s;e the acce&s;s of the hu&s;band &s;hall be pre&s;umed.

<P>It hath been held, that if a woman hath a child forty weeks and eight days after the death of her hu&s;band, it &s;hall be legitimate; the law having appointed no exact certain time for the birth of le|gitimate i&s;&s;ues. And here, if a woman great with child by a for|mer hu&s;band, &s;hall marry another man after his death, the child &s;hall be the lawful child of the fir&s;t hu&s;band; but if the woman be privily with child, it &s;hall belong to the &s;econd hu&s;band.

And a con&s;table cannot detain a man at his plea&s;ure, but only &s;tay him to bring him be|fore a ju&s;tice, to be examined and committed, &amp;c. <HI>Dalt. c.</HI> 1, 8. <HI>Lamb.</HI> 126, 141. <HI>H.

<P>If any offence be done, for which a con&s;table may arre&s;t with|out warrant, he may convey the offender to the &s;heriff or gaoler

of the county; and a con&s;table by his original authority, for breach of the peace, and &s;ome mi&s;demeanors that are not felony, may impri&s;on a man. But 'tis &s;afe&s;t and be&s;t, to bring offenders to a ju&s;tice, who, as the cau&s;e &s;hall require, will either bail or commit them to pri&s;on. Con&s;tables may not lawfully take up night-walkers, on bare &s;u&s;picion only of their being of ill fame; if they are not found breaking the peace, or doing &s;ome unlawful act, &amp;c. And in <HI>London</HI> they ought to be cautious, what per&s;ons they &s;end to the compter, taken up at night, for fear of actions for fal&s;e impri&s;onment. 2 <HI>Hale's Hi&s;t. Pl. C.</HI> 88, 89, 90.</P>
<P>One part of the office of con&s;tables is attendance upon judges of a&s;&s;ize, ju&s;tices of peace at their general and &s;pecial &s;e&s;&s;ions, and other meetings, to execute warrants, and pre&s;ent offences upon oath; and they mu&s;t attend at courts-leet, and on coroners, for executing warrants, &amp;c. Petty con&s;tables are to execute the warrants of ju&s;tices, and not di&s;pute it where the ju&s;tices hath juri&s;diction, and the warrant is lawful: and being &s;worn officers, they need not &s;hew their warrants when they come to arre&s;t any one. But if the ju&s;tice's warrant doth not &s;et forth the &s;pecial matter therein, it is unlawful; and if a ju&s;tice of peace &s;ends a warrant to a con&s;table to take up one for &s;lander, &amp;c. the ju&s;tice having no juri&s;diction in &s;uch ca&s;es, the con&s;table ought not to execute it; if he does, he is liable to action of fal&s;e impri&s;on|ment. 10 <HI>Rep.</HI> 76. 2 <HI>In&s;t.</HI> 291. 2 <HI>Danv.

<P>As the con&s;table is the proper officer to a ju&s;tice of peace, and bound to execute his lawful warrant; if a warrant be directed to any con&s;table by name, commanding him to execute the &s;ame, though he is not compellable to go out of his own pari&s;h, yet he may if he will, and execute it in any place in the county, and &s;hall be ju&s;tified by the warrant for his &s;o doing; but if the war|rant is directed to all con&s;tables, &amp;c. generally, no con&s;table can make execution of it out of his precinct. <HI>Salk.</HI> 175.</P>
<P>By warrant from a ju&s;tice, a con&s;table &s;hall &s;ell the goods of an offender apprehended to di&s;charge the expence of carrying him to gaol: if he hath no goods, then the town, where he was taken, mu&s;t be at the expence, and the con&s;table, with three or four of the principal inhabitants, may impo&s;e a tax on every inhabitant, &amp;c. which being allowed by a ju&s;tice of peace, the con&s;table by his warrant may levy it: and if the inhabitants refu&s;e to make a <HI>Rate,</HI> two ju&s;tices may by their warrant compel them to it. <HI>Stat.</HI> 3 <HI>Jac. c.</HI> 10.</P>

<P>And the duty of con&s;tables under particular heads, extends to affrays, alehou&s;es, arms, arre&s;ts, artificers, bakers, ba&s;tardy, bawdy|hou&s;es, bridges, butter, buttons, carriages, cattle, clothiers, coals, conventicles, cu&s;toms, deer-&s;tealing, de&s;erters, di&s;tillers, di&s;tre&s;s, drunkenne&s;s, dyers, e&s;capes, exci&s;e, felons, fi&s;h, forcible entry, fore&s;tallers, game, gaming, gaol and gaolers, gunpowder, haw|kers, hay-market, hedge-breakers, highways, hor&s;es, hue and cry, inns, juries, labourers, land-tax, mal&s;ters, mea&s;ures, militia, night|walkers, orchards robbed, phy&s;icians, plague popi&s;h, recu&s;ants, po&s;t-letters, pre&s;entments, pri&s;ons, pri&s;oners, riots, rogues, rob|bery, &s;abbath, &s;ervants, &s;hoemakers, &s;oldiers, &s;wearing, taylors, tithes, tobacco, vagrants, watch, warrants, weights, wreck, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Under all which heads above, the con&s;table's bu&s;ine&s;s is chiefly in &s;erving warrants, making commitments, and levying penalties, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> by order of ju&s;tices.</P>
<P>There is a long form of a con&s;table's oath in <HI>Dalton,</HI> which is adopted by Mr. <HI>Barlow,</HI> expre&s;&s;ing his duty in many in&s;tances; but as that form neverthele&s;s doth not contain the hundredth part of the con&s;table's duty, nor indeed the mo&s;t material in&s;tances thereof, it may be more elegible (as no particular form is directed by any &s;tatute) to &s;wear him to the due ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ution of his office in general, than to de&s;cend to tho&s;e particulars; le&s;t by mentioning &s;ome parts of his duty, and not others, he may be induced to think, that tho&s;e others are not &s;o nece&s;&s;ary. <HI>Burn's Ju&s;t. qto.</HI> 256. <HI>pl.</HI> 11.</P>

To compa&s;s or imagine the death of the king, queen or their elde&s;t &s;on and heir, is high trea&s;on: though it mu&s;t be manife&s;ted by &s;ome overt act; as by providing arms to do it, con&s;ulting to levy war again&s;t him, writ|ing letters to excite others to join therein, a&s;&s;embling per&s;ons in order to impri&s;on or depo&s;e the king, or to get him into their power, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> the&s;e acts are &s;ufficient to prove that one compa&s;&s;ed or imagined the death of the king, and to a man guilty of high trea&s;on. 3 <HI>In&s;t.</HI> 6, 12.</P>
<P>It was formerly held that compa&s;&s;ing by bare words, is not an overt-act to make this crime trea&s;on; but it hath been adjudged, that words are an overt-act: &s;uch deliberate words as &s;hew a di|rect purpo&s;e again&s;t the king's life, will amount to an overt-act of compa&s;&s;ing or imagining the king's death; for as the compa&s;&s;ing or imagining the death of the king is the trea&s;on, words are the mo&s;t natural way of expre&s;&s;ing the imagination of the heart, and may be good evidence of it: and any external act, which may be a manife&s;tation of &s;uch imagination, is an overt-act. But if words are &s;et down in writing, and kept privately in a man's clo&s;et, they are no overt-act of trea&s;on, except the words are publi&s;hed. <HI>Cro. Car.</HI> 242. <HI>Hawk. P.

<P>Words of per&s;ua&s;ion to kill the king, are overt-acts of compa&s;|ing his death; and it is held, that he who intendeth by force to pre&s;cribe laws to the king, and to re&s;train him of his power, doth intend to deprive him of his crown and life: that if a man be ig|norant of the intention of tho&s;e who take up arms again&s;t the king, if he joins in any action with them, he is guilty of trea&s;on: and that the law judges every rebellion to be a plot again&s;t the king's life, and a depo&s;ing him; becau&s;e a rebel would not &s;uffer that king to reign and live, who will puni&s;h him for rebellion. <HI>Moor</HI> 620.</P>
<P>Under the head of compa&s;&s;ing and imagining the king's death, intention of trea&s;on proved by circum&s;tances is puni&s;hed as high trea&s;on: and men's actions are governed by their intentions, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> 5 <HI>Mod.</HI> 206.</P>

cha&s;ti&s;ement, that he dieth; it is murder by expre&s;s malice.

Larceny is a private felony, again&s;t the goods of a man, in his ab&s;ence; and in re&s;pect of the thing &s;tolen, is either great or &s;mall: grand larceny is a felonious taking and carrying away the per&s;onal goods of another, above the value of 12<HI>d.</HI> not from the per&s;on, or by night, in the hou&s;e of the owner; and petit larce|ny is when the goods &s;tolen do not exceed the value of 12<HI>d. H. P. C.</HI> 69.</P>
<P>The difference between grand and petit larceny is only the value of the goods: and if two per&s;ons &s;teal goods to the value of 13<HI>d.</HI> it is grand larceny in both; and in ca&s;e one at different times &s;teals divers parcels of goods from the &s;ame per&s;on, which together ex|ceed the value of 12<HI>d.</HI> they may be put together in one indict|ment, and the offender found guilty of grand larceny; tho' this is very &s;eldom done: but on the contrary, the jury &s;ometimes, where it is an offender's fir&s;t offence, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> find it &s;pecially, as they may, that the goods are but 10<HI>d.</HI> value; &s;o as to be only petit larceny, though the offender be indicted for &s;tealing things of the value of 30 or 40<HI>s.</HI> 3 <HI>In&s;t.</HI> 109. <HI>H.

<P>To make the crime of larceny, there mu&s;t be a felonious tak|ing, or an intent of &s;tealing the thing, when it comes fir&s;t to the hands of the offender, at the very time of the receiving. If a man hath po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of goods once lawfully, though he afterwards carry them away with an ill attention, it is no larceny: where a taylor imbezils cloth delivered to him, to make a &s;uit of clothes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> it is no felony; nor is it where a &s;ervant goes away with his ma&s;ter's goods delivered to him, which is only a breach of tru&s;t, by rea&s;on of the delivery; (but by &s;tatute they are to be under 40<HI>s.</HI> value:) and if I lend a man a hor&s;e to go to a certain place, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> goes there, and then rides away with the hor&s;e, it is not larceny. 3 <HI>In&s;t.</HI> 107. <HI>Dalt.</HI> 367, 369. 5 <HI>Rep.</HI> 13. <HI>H P.

<P>As in the&s;e ca&s;es, there is a lawful po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion by the delivery of the goods, that extenuates the offence; but if one intending to &s;teal goods, get po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of them by ejectment, replevin, or other proce&s;s at law unduly obtained, by fal&s;e oath, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> it is a felonious taking. And a man may commit larceny, by taking away his own goods, in the hands of another; where the owner delivers goods to a carrier, and afterwards &s;ecretly &s;teals them from him, with an intent to charge him for them, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> becau&s;e the carrier had a &s;pecial property for a time. 3 <HI>In&s;t.</HI> 108, 64, 110. <HI>Kel.</HI> 43, 44. <HI>Dalt.</HI> 373.</P>
<P>All felony includes in it tre&s;pa&s;s, &s;o that if the party offending be guilty of no tre&s;pa&s;s in taking the goods, he cannot be guilty of felony or larceny in carrying them away. <HI>Hawk. P. C.</HI> 89.</P>
