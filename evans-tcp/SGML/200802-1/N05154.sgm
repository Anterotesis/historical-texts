<Q><BIBL><HI>John XIII. 15, 16.</HI></BIBL>
<P>For I have given you an Example, that ye &s;hould do as I have done to you. Verily verily, I &s;ay unto you, The Servant is not greater than his Lord, neither he that is &s;ent, greater than he that &s;ent him.</P></Q>

<P>WE have in this Context, an Account of one of the many very remarkable Things that pa&s;s'd that Night wherein Chri&s;t was betrayed (which was on many Accounts the mo&s;t remarkable Night that ever was) <HI>viz.</HI> Chri&s;t's wa&s;hing his Di&s;ciple's Feet; which Action, as it was exceeding wonderful in it&s;elf, &s;o it ma|nife&s;tly was &s;ymbolical, and repre&s;ented &s;omething el&s;e far more important and more wonderful, even that greate&s;t and mo&s;t wonderful of all Things that ever came to pa&s;s, which was accompli&s;hed the next Day in his la&s;t Sufferings. There were three &s;ymbolical Repre&s;entations given of that great Event this Evening; one in the Pa&s;&s;over, which Chri&s;t now partook of with his Di&s;ciples; another in the Lord's Supper, which he in&s;tituted at this Time; and another in this remarkable Action of his wa&s;hing his Di&s;ci|ple's

Feet. Wa&s;hing the Feet of Gue&s;ts was the Office of Servants, and one of their meane&s;t Offices: And therefore was fitly cho&s;en by our Saviour to repre&s;ent that great Aba&s;ement which he was to be the Subject of in the Form of a Servant, in becoming obedient unto Death, even that ignominious and accur&s;ed Death of the Cro&s;s, that he might clean&s;e the Souls of his Di&s;ciples from their Guilt and &s;pi|ritual Pollution.</P>
<P>This &s;piritual wa&s;hing and clean&s;ing of Believers was the End for which Chri&s;t &s;o aba&s;ed him&s;elf and gave him|&s;elf for them. Tit. ii. 14. <HI>Who gave him&s;elf for us, that he might redeem us from all Iniquity, and purify unto him&s;elf a peculiar People.</HI> Eph. v. 25, 26. <HI>Chri&s;t loved the Church, and gave him&s;elf for it, that he might &s;anctify and clean&s;e it with the wa&s;hing of Water.</HI>&mdash;That Chri&s;t's wa&s;hing his Di&s;|ciple's Feet, &s;ignified this &s;piritual wa&s;hing of the Soul, is manife&s;t by Chri&s;t's own Words in the 8th ver&s;e of the Context. Peter <HI>&s;aith unto him, Thou &s;halt never wa&s;h my Feet. Je&s;us an&s;wered him, If I wa&s;h thee not, thou ha&s;t no part with me.</HI> Chri&s;t in being obedient unto Death, even the Death of the Cro&s;s, not only did the part of a Servant unto God, but in &s;ome Re&s;pects al&s;o of a Servant unto us. And this is not the only Place where his &s;o aba&s;ing him|&s;elf for our &s;akes is compared to the doing of the part of a Servant to Gue&s;ts. We have the like Repre&s;entation made in <HI>Luke</HI> xxii. 27. <HI>For whether is greater, he that &s;it|teth at Meat, or he that &s;erveth? Is not he that &s;itteth at Meat? but I am among you as he that &s;erveth.</HI> And where|in Chri&s;t was among the Di&s;ciples as he that did &s;erve, is explain'd in <HI>Matt.</HI> xx. 28. namely, in <HI>his giving his Life a Ran&s;om for them.</HI></P>
<P>When Chri&s;t had fini&s;hed wa&s;hing his Di&s;ciple's Feet, he &s;olemnly requires their Attention to what he had done, and commands them to follow his Example therein. Ver&s;e
<PB N="7" REF="006492_0005_10290F4119CAC880">
12.&mdash;17. <HI>So after he had wa&s;hed their Feet, and had taken his Garments, and was &s;et down again, he &s;aid unto them, Know ye what I have done unto you? Ye call me Ma&s;ter and Lord, and ye &s;ay well, for &s;o I am. If I then your Lord and Ma&s;ter, have wa&s;hed your Feet, ye al&s;o ought to wa&s;h one another's Feet: For I have given you an Example, that ye &s;hould do as I have done to you. Verily, verily, I &s;ay unto you, the Servant is not greater than his Lord, neither he that is &s;ent, greater than he that &s;ent him. If ye know the&s;e Things, happy are ye if ye do them.</HI></P>
<P>When our Saviour calls on his Di&s;ciples to imitate the Example he had given them in what he had done, we are to under&s;tand him, not meerly by the Example he gave in the emblematical Action, in wa&s;hing his Di&s;ciple's Feet, in it &s;elf con&s;idered; but more e&s;pecially, of that much greater Act of his that was &s;ignified by it, in aba&s;ing him|&s;elf &s;o low, and &s;uffering &s;o much, for the &s;piritual Clean&s;ing and Salvation of his People. This is what is chiefly in|&s;i&s;ted on as the great Example Chri&s;t has given us to fol|low: So it is once and again afterwards, in the Di&s;cour&s;e Chri&s;t had with his Di&s;ciples, this &s;ame Night, <HI>v.</HI> 34. of the Chap. wherein is the Text; <HI>A new Commandment I give unto you, that ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye al&s;o love one another.</HI> Chap. xv. 12, 13. <HI>This is my Commandment, that ye love one another, as I have loved you. Greater love hath no Man than this, that a Man lay down his Life for his Friends.</HI> And &s;o in 1 <HI>John</HI> iii. 16. <HI>Hereby perceive we the love of God, becau&s;e he laid down his Life for us; and we ought to lay down our Lives for the Brethren.</HI></P>
<P>Chri&s;t in the Words of the Text, don't only intend to recommend this Example of his to the Di&s;ciples as <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> or &s;ome of his profe&s;&s;ing People, but e&s;pecially as his <HI>Mini&s;ters</HI> This is evident by tho&s;e Words he u&s;es
<PB N="8" REF="006492_0006_10290F441134BD48">
to enforce this Coun&s;el, <HI>Neither he that is &s;ent, is greater than he that &s;ent him.</HI> In which Words he manife&s;tly has re&s;pect to that great Errand on which he had <HI>&s;ent</HI> them, when he bid them <HI>go and preach the Go&s;pel to the lo&s;t Sheep of the Hou&s;e of</HI> I&s;rael. <HI>Mat.</HI> x. 5, 6. and on which they were to be <HI>&s;ent</HI> after his Re&s;urrection, when he &s;aid to them, <HI>Go ye into all the World, and preach the Go&s;pel to every Creature.</HI> The &s;ame Errand that Chri&s;t has re&s;pect to John xx. 21. <HI>As my Father hath &s;ent me, even &s;o &s;end I you.</HI></P>
<P>And what confirms this is, that Chri&s;t el&s;ewhere re|commends to Officers in his Church, that are in that re&s;pect chief among his Followers, the Example which he &s;et in his aba&s;ing him&s;elf to be as a Servant that mini&s;ters to Gue&s;ts at a Table, in his giving his Life for us; Matt. xx. 27, 28. <HI>Who&s;oever will be chief among you, let him be your Servant; Even as the Son of Man came not to be mini&s;tred unto, but to mini&s;ter, and to give his Life a Ran|&s;om for many.</HI> Compare Luke xxii. 25, 26, 27, 28.</P>
<P>The Work and Bu&s;ine&s;s of Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel is as it were that of Servants, to wa&s;h and clean&s;e the Souls of Men: For this is done by the preaching of the Word, which is their main Bu&s;ine&s;s, Eph. v. 26. <HI>That he might &s;anctifie and clean&s;e it with the wa&s;hing of Water by the Word.</HI></P>
<P>The Words of the Text thus con&s;idered, do undoubted|ly lead us to this Conclu&s;ion, and teach us this Doctrine, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P>That it is the Duty of Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel, in the Work of their Mini&s;try, to follow the Example of their great Lord and Ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>And this is what I would by Divine A&s;&s;i&s;tance make the Subject of my pre&s;ent Di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>And I propo&s;e to handle this Subject in the following Method.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="9" REF="006492_0007_10290F4939605AC0">I. I would ob&s;erve wherein Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel ought to follow the Example of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P N="2">II. Give &s;ome Rea&s;ons why they &s;hould follow his Example.</P>
<P N="3">III. I would endeavour to make a proper Application of tho&s;e Things to my &s;elf, and others that are called to this Work of the Mini&s;try.</P>
<P N="4">IV. Shew what Improvement &s;hould be made of them by the People of this Church and Congregation.</P>
<P N="1">I. Then, I would &s;hew wherein Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel ought in the Work of their Mini&s;try, to follow the Ex|ample of their great Lord and Ma&s;ter Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>And here,</P>
<P N="1">1. In general, Mini&s;ters &s;hould follow their Lord and Ma&s;ter in all tho&s;e excellent Virtues, and in that univer&s;al and eminent Holine&s;s of Life, which he &s;et an Example of in his human Nature.</P>
<P>The Mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t &s;hould be Per&s;ons of the &s;ame Spirit that their Lord was of: The &s;ame Spirit of Hu|mility and Lowline&s;s of Heart; for the Servant is not greater than his Lord. They &s;hould be of the &s;ame Spirit of Heavenly-mindedne&s;s and Contempt of the Glory, Wealth and Plea&s;ures of this World: They &s;hould be of the &s;ame Spirit of Devotion and fervent Love to God: They &s;hould follow the Example of his Prayerfulne&s;s; of whom we read from Time to Time of his retiring from the World, away from the Noi&s;e and Applau&s;es of the Multitudes, into Mountains and &s;olitary Places for &s;ecret Prayer, and holy Conver&s;e with his Father; and once of his ri&s;ing up in the Morning a great while before Day,
<PB N="10" REF="006492_0008_10290F4DC078C5F8">
and going and departing into a &s;olitary Place to pray; <HI>Mark</HI> i. 35. and another Time, of his going out into a Mountain to pray, and continuing all Night in Prayer to God, <HI>Luke</HI> vi. 12. Mini&s;ters &s;hould follow Chri&s;t's Example, in his &s;trict, con&s;tant and inflexible Ob&s;ervance of the Commands which God had given him, touching what he &s;hould do and what he &s;hould &s;ay; he &s;pake nothing of him&s;elf, but tho&s;e Things which the Father had commanded him, tho&s;e he &s;pake, and always did tho&s;e Things that plea&s;ed him, and continued in thorow Obedience and the greate&s;t Trials, and through the greate&s;t Oppo&s;i|tion that ever there was any In&s;tance of. Mini&s;ters &s;hould be Per&s;ons of the &s;ame quiet Lamb-like Spirit that Chri&s;t was of, the &s;ame Spirit of Submi&s;&s;ion to God's Will, and Patience under Afflictions, and Meekne&s;s towards Men, of the &s;ame Calmne&s;s and Compo&s;ure of Spirit under Re|proaches and Sufferings from the malignity of evil Men, of the &s;ame Spirit of Forgivene&s;s of Injuries; of the &s;ame Spirit of Charity, of fervent Love and exten&s;ive Benevo|lence; the &s;ame Di&s;po&s;ition to pity the mi&s;erable, to weep with tho&s;e that weep, to help Men under their Calamities of both Soul and Body, to hear and grant the Reque&s;ts of the needy, and relieve the afflicted; the &s;ame Spirit of Conde&s;cen&s;ion to the poor and mean, Tenderne&s;s and Gentlene&s;s towards the weak, and great and effectual Love to Enemies. They &s;hould al&s;o be of the &s;ame Spirit of Zeal, Diligence and Self-denial for the Glory of God, and Advancement of his Kingdom, and for the Good of Man|kind; for which Things &s;ake Chri&s;t went through the greate&s;t Labours, and endured the mo&s;t extreme Suf|ferings.</P>
<P N="2">2. More particularly &s;hould Mini&s;tres of the Go&s;pel follow the Example of their great Ma&s;ter, in the Manner in which they &s;eek the Salvation and Happine&s;s of the
<PB N="11" REF="006492_0009_10290F4F510B76E0">
Souls of Men. They &s;hould follow his Example of Love to Souls: Tho' it be impo&s;&s;ible that they &s;hould love them to &s;o great a Degree, yet they &s;hould have the &s;ame Spirit of Love to them, and Concern for their Sal|vation, according to their Capacity. Love to Men's Souls in Chri&s;t was far above any Regard he had to his temporal Intere&s;t, his Ea&s;e, his Honour, his Meat and Drink; and &s;o it &s;hould be with his Mini&s;ters. They &s;hould have the &s;ame Spirit of Compa&s;&s;ion to Men under their &s;piritual Calamities and Mi&s;eries, that he had of whom we read Mark vi. 34. <HI>That when he came out and &s;aw much People, he was moved with Compa&s;&s;ion towards them, becau&s;e they were as Sheep not having a Shepherd; and he began to teach them many Things.</HI> The Word tran&s;lated <HI>moved with Com|pa&s;&s;ion,</HI> &s;ignifies, that he was mo&s;t &s;en&s;ibly affected, and had his inmo&s;t Bowels moved with Pity. And again we read <HI>Luke</HI> xix. That when Chri&s;t was riding to <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> that wicked City, but a few Days before his Crucifixion, and was come to the De&s;cent of the <HI>Mount of Olives,</HI> where he had a fair View of the City, when he beheld it, he wept over it, on account of the Mi&s;ery and Ruin they had brought them&s;elves into Danger of by their Sin; altho' the Sin by which e&s;pecially they had made them&s;elves thus mi&s;erable, was their vile Treatment of him; (for <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> was a City that had been pecu|liarly injurious to him) and tho' Chri&s;t knew how cruelly he &s;hould be treated in that City before that Week was pa&s;t, how he there &s;hould be &s;et at nought, and with great malignity bound, fal&s;lely accu&s;ed and condemned, reviled, &s;pit upon, &s;courged and crucified: Yet all don't prevent his mo&s;t affectionate Tears of Compa&s;&s;ion towards them. <HI>When he was come near, he beheld the City, and wept over it, &s;aying, If thou had&s;t known, even thou,</HI> (thou as wicked as thou art, and as vile as thou ha&s;t been in thy Treat|ment
<PB N="12" REF="006492_0010_10290F532C9BD878">
of me; even thou) <HI>the Things which belong unto thy Peace! but now they are hid from thine Eyes.</HI> (Compare <HI>Matt.</HI> xxiii. 37. and <HI>Luke</HI> xiii. 34.) One would have thought he would have been more concerned for him&s;elf than <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> who had &s;uch a dreadful Cup to drink, and was to &s;uffer &s;uch extreme Things by the Cruelty of <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> that Week. But he as it were forgets his own Sorrow and Death, and weeps over the Mi&s;ery of his cruel Enemies.</P>
<P>Mini&s;ters &s;hould imitate their great Ma&s;ter in his fer|vent Prayers for the good of the Souls of Men. We find it to be Chri&s;ts Manner whenever he undertook any Thing of &s;pecial Importance in the Work of his Mini&s;try, fir&s;t to retire and pour out his Soul in extraordinary Prayer to his Father. Thus when he was about to enter on a Journey, and go a Circuit throughout all <HI>Galilee</HI> to preach in their Synagogues, <HI>he ro&s;e up a great while before Day, and went out, and departed into a &s;olitary Place, and there prayed.</HI> Mark i. 35 &mdash; 39. And when he was about to choo&s;e his twelve Apo&s;tles, and &s;end them out to preach the Go&s;pel, he fir&s;t <HI>went out into a Mountain to pray, and continued all Night in Prayer to God.</HI> Luke vi. 12. <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And the Night before his Crucifixion, wherein he offered up him&s;elf a Sacrifice for the Souls of Men, he pours out his Soul in extraordinary Prayer, for tho&s;e he was about to die for, as we have an Account in <HI>John</HI> xvii. That wonderful and mo&s;t affecting Prayer of his, was not &s;o much for him&s;elf as for his People. Altho' he knew what amazing Sufferings he was to under|go the next Day, yet he &s;eems as it were to be unmind|ful of him&s;elf, and to have his Heart all taken up with Concern about his Di&s;ciples; which he manife&s;ts in his &s;pending &s;o much Time in comforting and coun&s;elling them, and praying for them with great Affection, Com|pa&s;&s;ion,
<PB N="13" REF="006492_0011_10290F54CFBFB530">
earne&s;t Care and fatherly Tenderne&s;s. And the Prayers that he made in the Garden of <HI>Geth&s;emane,</HI> under the amazing View of the Cup he was to drink the next Day, &s;eem to be interce&s;&s;ory; e&s;pecially the la&s;t of the three Prayers which he there made, <HI>when being in an Agony, he prayed more earne&s;tly; and his Sweat was as it were great Drops of Blood falling down to the Ground:</HI> When he did not pray that the Cup might pa&s;s from him, as he had done before, but that <HI>God's Will might be done.</HI> (Compare <HI>Luke</HI> xxii. 44. with <HI>Matt.</HI> xxvi. 42.) That Prayer, as the Apo&s;tle teaches us, <HI>Heb.</HI> v. 6, 7. was a Prayer that he put up as our High Prie&s;t; and therefore mu&s;t be a Prayer of Interce&s;&s;ion for us, a Prayer offered up with his Blood which he &s;weat in his Agony; as Prayers were wont to be offered up with the Blood of the Sacrifices in the Temple. His Prayer at that Time, <HI>Thy Will be done,</HI> was not only an Expre&s;&s;ion of Submi&s;&s;ion, but had the Form of a Petition, as it is in the Lord's Prayer. He prayed that God's Will might be done in <HI>his</HI> being enabled <HI>to do the Will of God,</HI> per|&s;evering in Obedience unto Death; and in the &s;ucce&s;s of his Sufferings; which might in an eminent Manner be called the Will of God, as it is in <HI>P&s;.</HI> xl. 7, 8. <HI>Then &s;aid I, Lo, I come; &mdash; I delight to do thy Will, O my God.</HI></P>
<P>Mini&s;ters &s;hould follow the Example of Chri&s;t in his Diligence and Laboriou&s;ne&s;s in his Work. <HI>He went about doing Good, and healing all that were oppre&s;&s;ed of the Devil.</HI> Act. x. 38. So abundant was he in Labours, that often|times he &s;carcely allowed him&s;elf Time to eat or drink; in&s;omuch that his Friends &s;ometimes went out to lay hold of him, &s;aying, <HI>He is be&s;ide him&s;elf.</HI> Mark iii. 20, 21. That three Years and an half of his publick Mini&s;try was &s;o fill'd with Action and Labour, that one of his Di&s;ciples
<PB N="14" REF="006492_0012_10290F5A6D2C7BD0">
that con&s;tantly attended him, and was an Eye-witne&s;s of his Activity, tells us, that if <HI>all that he did &s;hould be written, the World would not contain the Books.</HI></P>
<P>Mini&s;ters &s;hould follow the Example of Chri&s;t, in his Readine&s;s not only to Labour, but &s;uffer for the Salva|tion of Souls, to &s;pend and be &s;pent for them. In this Re&s;pect the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul</HI> imitated his Lord and Ma&s;ter; Philip, ii. 17. <HI>Yea, and if I be offered upon the Sacrifice and Service of your Faith, I joy and rejoyce with you all.</HI> Col. i. 24. <HI>Who now rejoyce in my Sufferings for you, and fill up that which is behind of the Afflictions of Chri&s;t in my Fle&s;h, for his Bodies &s;ake, which is the Church.</HI> 2. Cor. xii. 15. <HI>And I will very gladly &s;pend and be &s;pent for you.</HI> Chri&s;t in his Prayers, Labours and Sufferings for the Souls of Men, is repre&s;ented as travelling in Birth with them. I&s;ai. liii. 11. <HI>He &s;hall &s;ee of the Travel of his Soul.</HI> In like manner &s;hould Mini&s;ters travel for the Con|ver&s;ion and Salvation of their Hearers. They &s;hould imitate the Faithfulne&s;s of Chri&s;t in his Mini&s;try, in &s;peak|ing what&s;oever God had commanded him, and declaring the whole Coun&s;el of God. They &s;hould imitate him in the Manner of his preaching; who taught not as the Scribes, but with Authority, boldly, zealou&s;ly and fer|vently; in&s;i&s;ting chiefly on the mo&s;t important Things in Religion, being much in warning Men of the Danger of Damnation, &s;etting forth the greatne&s;s of the future Mi&s;ery of the Ungodly; in&s;i&s;ting not only on the outward, but al&s;o the inward and &s;piritual Duties of Religion; being much in declaring the great Provocation and Danger of &s;piritual Pride, and a Self-righteous Di&s;po&s;ition; yet much in&s;i&s;ting on the Nece&s;&s;ity and Importance of inherent Ho|line&s;s, and the Practice of Piety. Behaving him&s;elf with admirable Wi&s;dom in all that he &s;aid and did in his Mi|ni&s;try, amid&s;t the many Difficulties, Enemies and Tempta|tions
<PB N="15" REF="006492_0013_10290F5D65360040">
he was &s;urrounded with, wonderfully adapting his Di&s;cour&s;es to Per&s;ons, Sea&s;ons and Occa&s;ions: I&s;ai. l. 4. <HI>The Lord God hath given me the Tongue of the learned, that I &s;hould know how to &s;peak a Word in Sea&s;on to him that is weary.</HI></P>
<P>Mini&s;ters &s;hould follow their Ma&s;ter in his Zeal, &s;o wonderfully mixed and temper'd with Gentlene&s;s and Con|de&s;cen&s;ion in his dealing with Souls; preaching the Go&s;|pel to the Poor, and taking a gracious Notice from Time to Time of little Children. And they &s;hould imi|tate their Lord in his following the Work of the Mini|&s;try, not from mercenary Views, or for the &s;ake of world|ly Advantages, but for God's Glory, and Men's Salvati|on; and in having his Heart engaged in his Work; it being his great Delight, and his Meat to do the Will of his Father, and fini&s;h his Work, <HI>John</HI> iv. 34. and having his Heart &s;et on the Succe&s;s of his great Undertaking in the Salvation of Souls; this being the Joy that was &s;et before him, for which he run his Race, endured the Cro&s;s, and de&s;pi&s;ed the Shame; his Delight in the Pro&s;pect of the eternal Salvation of Souls, more than countervailing the Dread he had of his extreme Sufferings. Many Wa|ters could not quench his Love, neither could the Floods drown it, for his Love was &s;tronger than Death; yea, than the mighty Pains and Torments of &s;uch a Death.</P>
<P N="2">II. I proceed now to the &s;econd Thing propo&s;ed in the handling this Subject, which was to give &s;ome <HI>Rea&s;ons</HI> why Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel &s;hould follow the Example of their great Lord and Ma&s;ter Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P N="1">1. They &s;hould follow his Example, becau&s;e he is their Lord and Ma&s;ter. Chri&s;t as he is a divine Per|&s;on, is the Lord of Heaven and Earth, and &s;o one of in|finite Dignity, to whom our &s;upreme Re&s;pect and Ado|ration
<PB N="16" REF="006492_0014_10290F608F302F00">
is due; and on that Account he is infinitely worthy that we &s;hould regard, not only his Precepts, but Ex|ample. The infinite Greatne&s;s and Honourablene&s;s of his Per&s;on recommends his Virtues, and a Conformity to them as our greate&s;t Dignity and Honour.</P>
<P>Chri&s;t is more e&s;pecially the Lord of Chri&s;tians; who are therefore under &s;pecial Obligations to follow him. He is their Shepherd, and &s;urely the Flock &s;hould follow their Shepherd. He is the Captain of their Salvation; and it becomes Soldiers to follow their Captain and Leader. He is their Head; not only their Head of Rule and Authority, but their Head of Influence and Com|munication, their vital Head, and Chri&s;tians are Members of his Body: But Members, as partakers of the Life and Spirit of the Head, are conformed to the Head.</P>
<P>But Chri&s;t is &s;till in a more peculiar Manner the Lord and Ma&s;ter of Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel, as they are not only Members of his Church, but the Officers of his Kingdom, and the dignified Servants of his Family. 'Tis the Manner of a People to imitate their Prince, but e&s;pe|cially the Mini&s;ters of his Kingdom, and Officers of his Hou&s;hold. 'Tis the Duty of the whole Army to follow their General, but e&s;pecially of tho&s;e Officers that have a Commi&s;&s;ion under him.</P>
<P N="2">2. Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel are in &s;ome Re&s;pects called and devoted to the &s;ame Work and Bu&s;ine&s;s that Chri&s;t him&s;elf was appointed to. Mini&s;ters are not Men's Medi|ators; for there is but one Mediator between God and Man, the Man Chri&s;t Je&s;us: They are not our Prie&s;ts to make Atonement and work out Righteou&s;ne&s;s for us; for Chri&s;t by one offering has perfected forever them that are &s;anctified: They are not Lords over God's Heritage; for one is their Ma&s;ter, even Chri&s;t. But yet Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel, as Chri&s;t's Servants and Officers under him,
<PB N="17" REF="006492_0015_10290F656FAAC628">
are appointed to promote the De&s;igns of that great Work of Chri&s;t, the Work of Salvation. 'Tis the Work that Mini&s;ters are devoted to; and therefore they are repre&s;ent|ed as <HI>Co-workers with Chri&s;t.</HI> 2 Cor. vi. 1. <HI>We then, as workers together with him, be&s;eech you al&s;o that ye receive not the Grace of God in vain.</HI> Chri&s;t is the Saviour of the Souls of Men; Mini&s;ters al&s;o, are &s;poken of in Scripture as <HI>&s;aving Men's Souls.</HI> 1 Tim. iv. 16. <HI>In doing this, thou &s;halt both &s;ave thy &s;elf and them that hear thee.</HI> Rom. x. 14. <HI>If by any Means I may provoke to Emulation them which are my Fle&s;h, and might &s;ave &s;ome of them.</HI> 1 Cor. ix. 22. <HI>That I might by all means &s;ave &s;ome.</HI> And whereas 'tis &s;aid Obad. 21. <HI>Saviours &s;hall come upon Mount Zion</HI>; Mini|&s;ters of the Go&s;pel are &s;uppo&s;ed to be there intended.</P>
<P>The Work of Mini&s;ters is in many Re&s;pects like the Work that Chri&s;t him&s;elf was appointed to, as the Saviour of Men; and e&s;pecially the &s;ame with the Work which Chri&s;t does in his Prophetical Office; only with this Dif|ference, that Mini&s;ters are to &s;peak and act wholly under Chri&s;t, as taught of him, as holding forth his Word, and by Light and Strength communicated from him. Chri&s;t him&s;elf after his Bapti&s;m, followed the Work of the Mi|ni&s;try: He was <HI>a Mini&s;ter of the true Sanctuary,</HI> (Heb. viii. 2.) He &s;pake and acted as his Father's Mini&s;ter; was a Mini&s;ter of the Go&s;pel, and as &s;uch preached and admini|&s;tred Sacraments. Pa&s;tors of Churches are Mini&s;ters of the &s;ame Go&s;pel; but in their Mini&s;try they act as the Mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t. Je&s;us Chri&s;t is the great <HI>Bi&s;hop of Souls</HI>; Mini&s;ters are al&s;o <HI>Bi&s;hops</HI> under him. Chri&s;t came into the World <HI>that he might be the Light of the World</HI>; Mini&s;ters are &s;et to be Lights unto the Churches, and are al&s;o &s;aid to be <HI>the Light of the World.</HI> Matt. v. 14. Chri&s;t is the <HI>bright and Morning Star</HI>; Mini&s;ters are <HI>Stars <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> Chri&s;t's Hand.</HI> Chri&s;t is <HI>the Me&s;&s;enger of the Covenant</HI>;
<PB N="18" REF="006492_0016_10290F621752C3A0">
Mini&s;ters are called <HI>Me&s;&s;engers of the Lord of Ho&s;ts.</HI> Chri&s;t is his People's <HI>Shepherd, the good Shepherd, the great Shepherd of his Sheep.</HI> Mini&s;ters are al&s;o frequently called <HI>Shepherds,</HI> and are directed to feed the Flock of Chri&s;t, which he pur|cha&s;ed with his own Blood.</P>
<P>Seeing therefore it is thus, that the Work that Mini&s;ters are called and devoted to, is no other than the Work of Chri&s;t, or the Work that Chri&s;t does, certainly they ought to do his Work; which they don't do, unle&s;s they imitate him, and do as he does, or as he hath &s;et 'em an Example.</P>
<P N="3">3. The Example of Chri&s;t is mo&s;t worthy of Mini&s;ters Imitation. His Example was perfect, without Error, Ble|mi&s;h or Defect; and therefore worthy to be made our Rule, and to be regarded and followed without Exception, Limitation or Re&s;erve; unle&s;s in tho&s;e Things which he did that were proper to his peculiar Office. Chri&s;t's Vir|tue was not only perfect, but was exerci&s;ed in tho&s;e Cir|cum&s;tances, and under tho&s;e Trials, that render'd his virtu|ous Acts va&s;tly the mo&s;t amiable of any that ever appear|ed in any Creature whether Man or Angel. If we con|&s;ider the Perfection of the Virtue that Chri&s;t exerci&s;ed, his Virtue did exceed that of the mo&s;t eminent Saints, more than the pure&s;t Gold exceeds the meane&s;t and foule&s;t Oar: And if we con&s;ider the Manner of its Exerci&s;e, and the Trials under which it was exerci&s;ed, and the ble&s;&s;ed Fruits it has brought forth, &s;o his Virtue exceeds that of all other perfectly innocent Creatures, and even of the brighte&s;t Angel, as the Sun in its Glory exceeds the Stars.</P>
<P>And this Example was &s;et us in our own Nature, and &s;o is e&s;pecially fitted for our Imitation. There was in the Man Chri&s;t Je&s;us, who was one of us, and dwelt among us, &s;uch Exerci&s;es of Virtue as became our State and Cir|cum&s;tances in the World, as tho&s;e who dwell in frail Fle&s;h and Blood, and as Members of humane Society, and dwel|lers
<PB N="19" REF="006492_0017_10290F6C179E5748">
in &s;uch a World of Sorrow and Death.</P>
<P>And then the&s;e amiable Exerci&s;es of Virtue in Chri&s;t, were exhibited chiefly in the Things which he did in that Work wherein Mini&s;ters are called to act as Co-workers with him. The bright and glorious Example of Chri&s;t that is &s;et before us, is chiefly in what he did during the three Years and half of his publick <HI>Mini&s;try</HI>; and in the Devotion, Heavenly-mindedne&s;s, Humility, Patience, Meekne&s;s, Forgivene&s;s, Self-denial and Charity, which he exerci&s;ed in the Labours and Sufferings he went through for the good of the Souls of Men: And therefore is e&s;pecial|ly &s;et for the Imitation of tho&s;e who are &s;et apart that they may make it the whole Bu&s;ine&s;s of their Lives to &s;eek the &s;ame good of Souls.</P>
<P N="4">4. Mini&s;ters &s;hould follow that Example of Chri&s;t which has been &s;poken of, becau&s;e if they are fit for Mi|ni&s;ters, and are &s;uch as have any Right to take that Work upon them&s;elves, Chri&s;t has &s;et them this Example in what he has <HI>done for their Souls. I have given you an Example,</HI> (&s;ays Chri&s;t in the Text) <HI>that you &s;hould do as I have done</HI> TO YOU. Mini&s;ters &s;hould be animated in this Work by a great Love to the Souls of Men, and &s;hould be rea|dy to &s;pend and be &s;pent for them; for Chri&s;t <HI>loved them,</HI> and gave him&s;elf <HI>for them</HI>: He loved them with a Love &s;tronger than Death. They &s;hould have Compa&s;&s;ion to Men under their &s;piritual Mi&s;eries, as Chri&s;t had Pity on them. They &s;hould be much in Prayer for the People of their Flock, con&s;idering how Chri&s;t prayed and agonized for them, in tears of Blood. They &s;hould travel in Birth with the Souls that are committed to their Care, &s;eeing their own Salvation is the Fruit of the Travel of Chri&s;t's Soul. They &s;hould exerci&s;e a meek and conde&s;cending Spirit to the mean and weak and poor, and &s;hould as it were wa&s;h the Feet of Chri&s;t's Di&s;ciples; con&s;idering how
<PB N="20" REF="006492_0018_10290F6DA47F8D38">
Chri&s;t conde&s;cended to them, when they were wretched and mi&s;erable and poor and blind and naked, and aba&s;ed him|&s;elf to wa&s;h their Feet.</P>
<P>The chief Trials of Chri&s;t's Virtue, and &s;o their mo&s;t bright and eminent Exerci&s;es were in the Aba&s;ement, La|bour and Suffering, that he was the Subject of for our Sal|vation. Which certainly may well endear tho&s;e Virtues to us, and greatly engage us to imitate that Example: So the Things whereof this Example con&s;i&s;ts, were Things by which we have infinite Benefit, without which we &s;hould have been un&s;peakably mi&s;erable for ever and ever, and by virtue of which we have the glorious Priviledge of the Children of God, and have a full Title to the Crown of exceeding Glory, and Plea&s;ures for ever more, at God's right Hand.</P>
<P N="3">III. I now proceed, as was propo&s;ed, in the <HI>third</HI> Place, to apply what has been &s;aid to my &s;elf, and others that are employed in this &s;acred Work of the Go&s;pel Mini&s;try, and to &s;uch as are about to undertake it, or are Candidates for it; and particularly to him that is now to be &s;olemnly &s;et apart to this Work in this Place.</P>
<P>We are tho&s;e to whom the&s;e Things e&s;pecially belong: We may hear Chri&s;t &s;aying to us this Day, <HI>I have given you an Example, that ye &s;hould do as I have done.</HI> For the Words of Chri&s;t in the Text were not only &s;poken to the twelve, but are al&s;o &s;poken unto us. We have now had repre&s;ented to us, tho' in a very imperfect Manner, the Ex|ample that Chri&s;t has &s;et, and what Rea&s;ons there are that we, above all others, &s;hould imitate it.</P>
<P>It is not only our great Duty, but will be our greate&s;t Honour to imitate Chri&s;t, and do the Work that he has done, and &s;o act as Co-workers with him.</P>
<P>There are two kinds of Per&s;ons that are given to Chri&s;t,
<PB N="21" REF="006492_0019_10290F6F4AD930F0">
and appointed and devoted of God to be his Servants, to be employed with Chri&s;t, and under him, in his great Work of the Salvation of the Souls of Men; and they are <HI>Angels</HI> and <HI>Mini&s;ters.</HI> The Angels are all of them, even the mo&s;t exalted of them, &s;ubjected of God the Father to our Redeemer, and given to him as his Servants, to be &s;ub&s;ervient to the great De&s;igns of his &s;aving and glorify|ing his Elect; Heb. i. 14. <HI>Are they not all mini&s;tring Spirits, &s;ent forth to mini&s;ter for them who &s;hall be Heirs of Salvation?</HI> And doubtle&s;s, they were created for this very End; God made them for his Son, to be &s;ub&s;ervient to him in this great Work; which &s;eems to be the chief De|&s;ign of all God's Works. And the Employment of Mi|ni&s;ters of the Go&s;pel in this Re&s;pect, is like that of the glorious Angels. The Principalities and Powers in heaven|ly Places, e&s;teem it not any Deba&s;ement, but their great Honour, to be employed as Chri&s;t's Mini&s;ters in this Work; for therein they are employed as the Mini&s;ters of God, in the greate&s;t and mo&s;t honourable of all God's Works; that Work of God wherein his Glory is chiefly di&s;played, and which his Heart was chiefly upon from Eternity. 'Tis the Honour of the Son of God him&s;elf, that he is appointed to this Work. It was becau&s;e God the Father infinitely loved his Son, and delighted to put Honour upon him, that he appointed him to be the Au|thor of that glorious Work of the Salvation of Men. And when we con&s;ider the Greatne&s;s, Importance and Excellency of it, we have Rea&s;on to be a&s;toni&s;hed at the Conde&s;cen&s;ion of God, that he would ever improve meer Creatures as Co-workers and Mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t in this Affair; <HI>for who is &s;ufficient for the&s;e Things?</HI> 2 Cor. ii. 16. <HI>Who is fit, or worthy? Who is equal to a Work of &s;uch Dignity, and va&s;t Importance?</HI> E&s;pecially have we Rea&s;on to wonder that God will employ not only holy and glori|ous
<PB N="22" REF="006492_0020_10290F72942B5098">
Angels, but feeble, frail, &s;inful Worms of the Du&s;t, in this Work, who need Redemption them&s;elves: And yet the Honour that is put upon faithful Mini&s;ters, is in &s;ome Re&s;pects greater than that of the Angels: They &s;eem to be that Kind of Servants that are the mo&s;t dig|nified of the two. For Chri&s;t makes his Angels to be mini&s;tring Spirits unto them, unto the faithful Mini&s;ters; and the Angels are their Angels: As faithful Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel are not only Mini&s;ters to the Church, but dignified Members of the Church, that Spou&s;e of the King of Glory, on whom the mo&s;t glorious Angels, the highe&s;t Mini&s;ters in the Court of Heaven, are appointed to attend. And then Chri&s;t &s;eems e&s;pecially to delight to carry on his Work of the Salvation of Souls, through the Mini&s;trations of Men, who have that Nature that Chri&s;t is united to, and that are of tho&s;e Sons of Men with whom he had his Delight before the World was made. So it is by the Mini&s;tration of Men, that the Scriptures are given; they were the Penmen of the holy Bible; and by them the Go&s;pel is preached to the World: By them Ordinances are admini&s;tred, and thro' their Mi|ni&s;trations e&s;pecially Souls are converted. When Chri&s;t him&s;elf was employed in the Work of the Mini&s;try in the Time of his Humiliation, but few comparatively were brought home to him, immediately by his Mini&s;tra|tions: It plea&s;ed Chri&s;t to re&s;erve this Honour for his Di&s;ciples and Mini&s;ters after his A&s;cen&s;ion, to whom he promi&s;ed that they &s;hould in this Re&s;pect do greater Works than he, <HI>Joh.</HI> xiv. 12. and accordingly it was by their preaching that the Gentile World was converted, and Satan's Kingdom overthrown. Thus God delights <HI>to perfect Prai&s;e out of the Mouths of Babes and Sucklings, that he may &s;till the Enemy and the Avenger.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="006492_0021_10290F79AB5AEC38">It will be our great Honour that we are called to this Work of Chri&s;t, if therein we follow him; for therein we &s;hall be like the Son of God: But if we are unfaithful in this Office, and don't imitate our Ma&s;ter, our Offence will be heinous in proportion to the Dignity of our Office, and our final and everla&s;ting Di&s;grace and Ignominy proportionably great; and we who in Honour are ex|alted up to Heaven, &s;hall be ca&s;t down proportionably low in Hell.</P>
<P>Let us further con&s;ider, that our following the Example of Chri&s;t in the Work of the Mini&s;try, is the way to enjoy the &s;en&s;ible joyful Pre&s;ence of Chri&s;t with us. The Di&s;ciples had the Comfort of Chri&s;t's Pre&s;ence and Con|ver&s;ation by following him, and going where he went. When we cea&s;e to follow him, he will go from us, and we &s;hall &s;oon loo&s;e Sight of him.</P>
<P>Our being conformed to Chri&s;t's Example, will al&s;o be the way for us to be conformed to him, and partake with him in his Priviledges: 'Tis the way for us to have his Joy fulfilled in us. Chri&s;t in doing the Work which the Father appointed him to, obtained a glorious Victory over his Enemies, and having &s;poiled Principalities and Powers, triumphed over them. If we imitate his Ex|ample, it will be the way for us in like Manner to con|quer Principalities and Powers, yea, to be much more than Conquerors: It will be the way for us always to triumph in Chri&s;t Je&s;us. It will be the way for us to obtain Succe&s;s in our Mini&s;try, and actually to be made the happy In&s;truments of the Eternal Salvation of Souls. Chri&s;t has not only <HI>told</HI> us, but <HI>&s;hown</HI> us the Way to Suc|ce&s;s in our Bu&s;ine&s;s, and the way to Victory over all that oppo&s;e us in it. And our imitating Chri&s;t in our Mini|&s;try, will be the way for us to be Partakers with him in his Glory; the way for us in like manner to be ap|proved,
<PB N="24" REF="006492_0022_10290F7B6D04A0B0">
and openly honoured and rewarded by God; the way to be brought to &s;it with Chri&s;t on his Throne, as he is &s;et down with the Father on his Throne. And as Chri&s;t is now exalted to &s;hine as the bright Luminary and Glory of Heaven, &s;o our following his Example, will be the way for us to be exalted to <HI>&s;hine</HI> with him, <HI>as the Stars forever and ever.</HI> Dan. xii. 3. And as Chri&s;t in Heaven rejoices in his Succe&s;s, and will receive his Church, pre&s;ented to him without Spot, as his everla&s;ting Crown; &s;o our imitating Chri&s;t in our Work, will be the way to partake with Chri&s;t in this Joy, and have the Souls, who&s;e Salvation we are the In&s;truments of, to be our Crown of Rejoicing forever. Thus Chri&s;t and we &s;hall rejoice together in that World of Glory and Joy where there is no more Labour or Sorrow. And we mu&s;t enter into that Joy and Glory, in the way of following Chri&s;t in our Work; there is no other way for Mini&s;ters to enter there.</P>
<P>And that we may thus follow Chri&s;t's Example, and be Partakers with him in his Glory, we had need to be much in Prayer for his Spirit. Chri&s;t him&s;elf, tho' the Eternal Son of God, obtained the Holy Spirit for him&s;elf in a way of Prayer, Luke iii. 21, 22. <HI>Je&s;us being baptized, and praying, the Heaven was opened, and the Holy Gho&s;t de&s;cended like a Dove upon him.</HI> If we have the Spirit of Chri&s;t dwelling in us, we &s;hall have Chri&s;t him&s;elf there|by living in us, and then we &s;hall undoubtedly live like him. If that Fountain of Light dwells richly in us, we &s;hall &s;hine like him, and &s;o &s;hall be burning and &s;hining Lights.</P>
<P>That we may <HI>be</HI> and <HI>behave</HI> like Chri&s;t, we &s;hould earne&s;tly &s;eek much Acquaintance with him, and much Love to him, and be much in &s;ecret Conver&s;e with him.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="006492_0023_10290F7EB1B55780">'Tis natural, and as it were nece&s;&s;ary for us to imitate tho&s;e whom we are much acquainted and conver&s;ant with, and have a &s;trong Affection for.</P>
<P>And in order to our imitating Chri&s;t in the Work of the Mini&s;try, in any tolerable Degree, we had need not to have our Hearts overcharged, and Time filled up with worldly Affections, Cares and Pur&s;uits. The Duties of a Mini&s;ter that have been recommended, are ab&s;olutely incon&s;i&s;tent with a Mind much taken up with worldly Profit, Glory, Amu&s;ements and Entertainments.</P>
<P>And another Thing that is of very great Importance, in order to our doing the Work that Chri&s;t did, is, that we take heed that the Religion we promote, be that &s;ame Religion that Chri&s;t taught and promoted, and not any of its Counterfeits and delu&s;ive Appearances, or any Thing &s;ub&s;tituted by the &s;ubtil Devices of Satan, or vain Imaginations of Men in Lieu of it. If we are zealous and very diligent to promote Religion, but don't take good Care to di&s;tingui&s;h true from fal&s;e Religion, we &s;hall be in Danger of doing much more Hurt than Good, with all our Zeal and Activity.</P>
<P N="4">IV. I come now to the fourth and la&s;t Thing at fir&s;t propo&s;ed, <HI>viz.</HI> to &s;how what Improvement &s;hould be made of what has been &s;aid, by the People of this Church and Congregation, who are now about &s;olemnly to com|mit their Souls to the Charge of him whom they have cho&s;en to be their Pa&s;tor, and who is now about to be &s;et apart to that Office.</P>
<P>And <HI>you, my Brethren,</HI> as all of you have immortal Souls to &s;ave, if you have con&s;idered the Things that have been &s;poken, can't but be &s;en&s;ible, that it not only greatly con|cerns your elect Pa&s;tor to take heed how he behaves him&s;elf in his great Work, wherein he is to act as a Co-worker

and mi&s;erably &s;tarve your own Souls, and the Souls of your Children, and will but cheat your &s;elves; for you will not be in the way to pro&s;per either in your &s;piritual or temporal Concerns. The way to have your Hou&s;es filled with Plenty, is to <HI>honour the Lord with your Sub|&s;tance, and with the fir&s;t Fruits of all your Increa&s;e.</HI> Prov. iii. 9.</P>
<P>And as it is your Duty and Intere&s;t well to &s;upport your <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">, &s;o it concerns you to pray earne&s;tly for him, an<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">ch one to do what in him lies in all Re&s;pects to encourage and help him, and &s;trengthen his Hands, by attending diligently to his Mini&s;try, receiving the Truth in Love, treating him with the Honour due to a Me&s;&s;enger of Chri&s;t, carefully avoiding all Contention with him, and one with another. And take heed in particular, that you don't for&s;ake him to follow tho&s;e, who under Pretence of extraordinary Purity, are doubtle&s;s do|ing the Devil's Work, in &s;eparating them&s;elves, and en|deavouring to draw off others from the Mini&s;ters and Churches in the Land in general.</P>
<P>If you think I have &s;poken &s;omething freely to you, I hope it will be con&s;idered, that this is probably the la&s;t Time you will ever hear me &s;peak from the Pulpit, and that I &s;hall never &s;ee you again 'till we &s;ee one another in the invi&s;ible eternal World, where the&s;e Things will open to us all in their ju&s;t Importance.</P>
<P>And now nothing is left but to expre&s;s my &s;incere&s;t Wi&s;hes and Prayers, that the God of all Grace would be with you, and your elect Pa&s;tor, and that he would give you in him a great and long la&s;ting Ble&s;&s;ing, that you may enjoy much of the Pre&s;ence of Chri&s;t with you in him; that in him may be made up the great Lo&s;s you &s;u&s;tained by the Death of your former faithful and eminent Pa&s;tor, who&s;e Prai&s;e was in all the Churches;

and that you may receive him as you ought to receive a faithful Mini&s;ter of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and may be a great Comfort to him, and may receive great &s;piritual and eter|nal Benefit by his Means; and that you may be each other's Crown of Rejoicing in the Day of the Lord Je&s;us.</P>
