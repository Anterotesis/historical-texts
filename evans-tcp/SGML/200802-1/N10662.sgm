<OPENER><SALUTE>My benevolent Town&s;men and other hearers,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_FROM a &s;en&s;e of my incapacity, and the &s;hortne&s;s of the time allowed me to prepare, I repeatedly declined &s;peaking in public, on a day &s;et apart to Commemorate the bloody Ma&s;&s;acre, the bar|barous butchery at Bo&s;ton four years ago. And when I looked over the excellent peices that have been printed on that &s;orrowful occa&s;ion, I thought very little new could be offered, and therefore felt the greater inclination to be ex|cu&s;ed. But the importunity of friends which finally overcame me, I hope will be a &s;ufficient apology, and engage your candour in hearing, while I offer a few things inferred from</P>

<BIBL><HI>GALATIANS, Chap. 5. Ver. 1.</HI></BIBL>
<P>Stand fa&s;t therefore in the Liberty wherewith <HI>CHRIST</HI> hath made you free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage.</P></Q>
<P>IGNORANCE, pride, covetiou&s;ne&s;s, or the lu&s;t of power, has, in all ages, influenced many men to exert them&s;elves many ways, to fix a yoke of bondage upon the necks of &s;ome of their brethren. The Jewi&s;h Doctors being ignorant of that freedom which Chri&s;t gave his true follow|ers by his obedience and death, u&s;ed their utmo&s;t art to en&s;lave their bre|thren by the rites and ob&s;ervances of the ceremonial law, and when our Apo&s;tle oppo&s;ed them, no doubt their pride and covetuou&s;ne&s;s wrought fervently, as their gain and &s;overeignty were in danger of being entirely muzzled. And had they obtained their end in bringing this yoke upon the Gentile converts, yet even then, they would not have been ea&s;y, for they were never able to bear it them&s;elves.</P>
<P>BUT there are other ways of en&s;laving men, be&s;ides by burden&s;ome rites: Burden&s;om taxes laid upon them without their con&s;ent, whether in the <HI>State</HI> or in the <HI>Church,</HI> are a &s;inful yoke of bondage.</P>
<P>AS to the STATE; Our patriotic brethren in BOSTON, have ju&s;tly ob|&s;erved on one of the&s;e anniver&s;ary occa&s;ions, that a noble attachment to a free CONSTITUTION rai&s;ed ancient ROME
<Q>from the &s;malle&s;t beginings to that bright &s;ummit of happine&s;s and glory to which &s;he arrived; and it was the lo&s;s of this which plunged her from that &s;ummit into the black gulph of infamy and &s;lavery.</Q></P>
<P>AND we &s;hall add, the &s;ame &s;pirit of liberty prevailed in Chri&s;tian Rome at the fir&s;t embracing Chri&s;tian principles: But they were &s;oon di&s;po&s;ed to en&s;lave their brethren re&s;pecting matters of religion, as they had done
<PB N="7" REF="013513_0005_0F90F6CB8D1E3B08">
in the &s;tate before they embraced the Chri&s;tian faith. Their merchan|dize and hire were &s;oon employed for &s;weet incen&s;e and co&s;tly perfumes, to &s;erve the pride and luxury of the great; until at la&s;t, haughty Popes and Prelates u&s;urped a tyrannical power over the con&s;ciences of men and drew money out of their pockets, for pardons and indulgencies, and for praying them out of purgatory, which was to their de&s;truction and not to their &s;alvation.</P>
<P>IT would not have been quite &s;o dark, had the yoke never been put upon the necks of <HI>prote&s;tants</HI>; but <HI>per&s;ecution</HI> for con&s;cience &s;ake&mdash;im|pri&s;onment, confi&s;cation of goods, bani&s;hment and even death, have often been practi&s;ed &s;ince the reformation, and in prote&s;tant nations too. Nor would it be nece&s;&s;ary to go out of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Scotland</HI> for many in&s;tan|ces of &s;uch flagrant wickedne&s;s.&mdash;But can we pretend that <HI>New-England</HI> ever attempted to lay a yoke of bondage upon any of its inhabitants, for con&s;cience &s;ake? Here we &s;hall &s;pread a viel over our fore-fathers, and leave their extraordinary conduct with that God who judgeth righteous judgment. We need not go back for proof to make it appear, that men have endeavoured to en&s;lave their brethren in <HI>eccle&s;ia&s;tical</HI> concerns: for all tho&s;e that <HI>forcibly</HI> take away the money or property from their hone&s;t neighbours to &s;upport a mini&s;ter which they cannot in con&s;cience attend, are guilty of &s;piritual tyranny: They take away their money or lay a tax upon them without their con&s;ent, and di&s;enable them to &s;upport the wor&s;hip of God agreeable to the dictates of their own con&s;ciences. And if this is not en&s;laving men in their mo&s;t important intere&s;ts, in the name of wonder, what is? Our neighbours<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">New Hamp&s;hire.</NOTE> have been convenced of

the inju&s;tice of &s;uch a practice, and have granted liberty of con&s;cience to all denominations of prote&s;tants. Nor do I know of any province in <HI>New-England,</HI> in this enlightened age of liberty, but what has done the &s;ame, except THIS, which is foremo&s;t in e&s;pou&s;ing the cau&s;e of <HI>civil</HI> liberty.&mdash;But violence and &s;poil are &s;till heard in our dear province. It has relieved <HI>Epi&s;copalians, Anabapti&s;ts</HI> and <HI>Quakers,</HI> but &s;till keeps the yoke of bondage upon the necks of <HI>Calvini&s;ts.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>BY <HI>Calvini&s;ts</HI> is meant the whole of tho&s;e doctrines which are u&s;ually called <HI>Cal|vini&s;tic</HI> as they are contained in the <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter, New-England</HI> and other prote&s;tant confe&s;&s;ions of faith, that we are generally acquainted with, or at lea&s;t might to be, al&s;o the <HI>government</HI> of the church agreeable to the Calvini&s;tic or Pre&s;byterian plan.&mdash; Both the doctrines and government referred to, we apprehend are founded on the &s;crip|tures; and, viewing them in this light, we are careful to regard them&mdash;not meerly as terms of peace, but as terms of &s;tated communion.</P>
<P>For men to &s;ay that they chearfully take the holy &s;criptures for their rule, is, in our opinion, too uncertain to be received as a te&s;t of their orthodoxy in the faith, or their agreement in wor&s;hip and government; for as <HI>to the faith,</HI> it is well known, that a|vowed <HI>Arians, Pelagians, Arminians, Socinians, Antinomians,</HI> &amp;c. &amp;c. will as readily &s;ay that they take the holy &s;criptures for their rule, as the <HI>&s;tricte&s;t</HI> Calvini&s;ts: But rea|&s;on it&s;elf teaches, that words and &s;yllables, in our Engli&s;h Bible, do not, but &s;en&s;e and meaning do determine whither, and how far men agree with the word of God. We apprehend it nece&s;&s;ary to be known what &s;en&s;e men put upon the &s;criptures, in the di&s;|tingui&s;hing doctrines of Chri&s;tianity, in order to <HI>occa&s;ional</HI> communion with them; and how, or in what &s;en&s;e they under&s;tand the &s;criptures relative to church govern|ment, in order to &s;tated communion. We are fully per&s;uaded that it is owing to the randum way of &s;ettling mini&s;ters and churches, together with a vile contempt of creeds and confe&s;&s;ions, that has been the guilty cau&s;e of the many confu&s;ions and di&s;tre&s;&s;es in the land. No &s;ort of church government fixed, but all is managed to &s;uit the ta&s;te of the party concerned; and all confe&s;&s;ions of faith, by which the &s;en&s;e and meaning of &s;cripture may be known, are &s;et a&s;ide.&mdash;Hence, all &s;eem to jumble together, and make meer <HI>hodge podge.</HI> Yet we hope better things of &s;ome, though we thus &s;peak; and as to our&s;elves, we openly declare we cannot receive doctrines in a &s;en&s;e counter to the &s;tandards which we have &s;olemnly &s;ub&s;cribed. We apprehend that upon the &s;tricte&s;t examination they will &s;tand the te&s;t, and as to church government, we think it does not depend upon the capricious humours of men, but is of divine original, both as to the thing it&s;elf, and the way of admini&s;tration. Yet if any are otherwi&s;e minded re&s;pecting government, we are far from &s;triping them of the Chri&s;tian character, pro|vided they firmly adhere to the great doctrines of Chri&s;tianity, which di&s;tingui&s;h that from all other religions in the world.</P></NOTE> The&s;e, though they are
<PB N="9" REF="013513_0007_0F90A2F2A69D96F0">
and through the &s;hifting &s;cenes of &s;tate affairs, have been as dutiful &s;ubjects as ever the HOUSE of HANOVER had, mu&s;t be kept in &s;lavery; while we as one united body are pleading for liberty.</P>
<P>BLESSED be God the &s;everal congregations in this town, have <HI>honoured</HI> them&s;elves and done ju&s;tice in this affair, by cordially agreeing in one united application to our ASSEMBLY with &s;ucce&s;s, that each religious &s;ociety in the town, &s;hould be obliged to pay mini&s;terial charges "where they meet for public wor&s;hip" and they are exempted from "paying to|wards the &s;upport of the mini&s;try, and from other incidental charges at any other place than where they attend." This is truly becoming the &s;ons of liberty, and well worthy the imitation of every town in the province. It is no more than our excellent CHARTER allows us, though, it is pleaded, our laws made for ECCLESIASTICAL affairs abridge us of this liberty.</P>
<P>WERE the&s;e equitable principles which have been the price of blood, propagated in <HI>eccle&s;ia&s;tical</HI> as <HI>warmly</HI> as in civil concerns, there would be
<PB N="10" REF="013513_0008_0F90A2F3252402C8">
much more peace and &s;ocial happine&s;s in our pari&s;hes than has generally prevailed among us. But whether this privilege be granted to the church or not, yet I am &s;ure the law of rea&s;on and equity will &s;tand up in favour of it.</P>
<P>THOUGH I have ob&s;erved "with high &s;atisfaction, the zeal and exer|tions of the Americans in defence of their rights and liberties" of a civil kind, and earne&s;tly with that HE who holds the univer&s;e in his hands, may crown their warme&s;t efforts with everla&s;ting &s;ucce&s;s&mdash;Yet I own it looks odd to me, that a PROVINCE which holds on <HI>eccle&s;ia&s;tical</HI> tyranny beyond all her &s;i&s;ter colonies &s;hould be foremo&s;t in her attempts and pleas for <HI>civil</HI> liberty.&mdash;Nor can I groundedly hope for the &s;miles of Heaven upon us, in our utmo&s;t efforts, if we endeavour to en&s;lave our Chri&s;tian brethren in their eccle&s;ia&s;tical concerns; for while we plead for liberty on one hand, and promote &s;lavery on the other, our principles are too contracted and corrupt; and if we regard oppre&s;&s;ion in our hearts the Lord will not hear us. Chri&s;tian liberty, both civil and eccle&s;ia&s;tical, is the greate&s;t ble&s;&s;ing of the kind, that we can enjoy; and therefore to be deprived of either, is the greate&s;t injury we can &s;uffer; and whoever they be that at|tempt to hold us in the claws of tyranny, mu&s;t be heineous offenders in the &s;ight of God. All attempts to ju&s;tify &s;lavery, are but the feeble endea|vours of &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s to oppo&s;e the law of nature and divine revelation, and &s;erve to &s;how us the weakne&s;s of the judgment and the wickedne&s;s of the human heart.</P>
<P>I WISH and earne&s;tly pray that our patriotic Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives may be in&s;pired to exert them&s;elves, in the wi&s;e&s;t and mo&s;t effectual way, to put an end to all civil and eccle&s;ia&s;tical oppre&s;&s;ion, and to make liberty e|qual
<PB N="11" REF="013513_0009_0F90A2F3E824F658">
to all men inhabiting the province.&mdash;This, this would immortalize their names, and all the &s;ons of liberty would ri&s;e up and call them ble&s;&s;ed. When that time commences it will be a token for good that ju&s;tice will run down our &s;treets as waters, and righteou&s;ne&s;s as a mighty &s;tream.</P>
<P>BUT whether &s;ucce&s;s attends our endeavours or not, it becomes us, as men and chri&s;tians, to a&s;&s;ert our natural and con&s;titutional privileges &mdash;never to give them up, but if po&s;&s;ible to recover and defend them a|gain&s;t all malicious claims of haughty and covetious tools of arbitrary power, they are a legacy left us by Chri&s;t, the purcha&s;e of his blood. And will any tamely &s;ubmit to be entangled with the yoke of bondage, now Chri&s;t has made us free!</P>
<P>SURELY, <HI>My Friends and Town&s;men,</HI> you will be very jealous for the defence for our excellent con&s;titution, and where a breach is made upon it you will earne&s;tly contend for its being healed. Neither the high no|tions of the Briti&s;h Parliament, nor the groundle&s;s prejudices in this Pro|vince, &s;hould intimidate your minds. Where is the brave &s;pirits of our Fore-fathers that ventured life and all that was dear to them, rather, than give up their privileges to the plea&s;ure of <HI>Sir Edmund Andro&s;e</HI> and his creatures! Sure, in this enlightned age of liberty, you will not readily yeild to &s;lavery. Now natural and con&s;titutional rites are &s;o well under|&s;tood, and appear &s;o rea&s;onable you cannot de&s;ert the cau&s;e, nor grow indifferent about it. I per&s;wade my&s;elf, that you, in combination with our brethren, will be more &s;ucce&s;sful than our mother country has &s;ome times been, in pre&s;erving that reverance and authority which is due to chri&s;tian liberty.</P>
<P>I PITY rather than hate the Briti&s;h parliament, in their tyrannic &s;en|timents

re&s;pecting the Colonies. We chu&s;e to be as one body&mdash;like <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> as a City COMPACT together. We de&s;ire to live in con|nection with Great-Britain, in a &s;weet harmony, and are grieved to &s;ee the di&s;poti&s;m that is breaking us a&s;under. I pity the place-men and pen&s;ioners in this Province, who are &s;triving by public mea&s;ures among our&s;elves, and private letters to men abroad, to keep up and increa&s;e the alienation between us and our mother country. I wi&s;h the bleeding wounds may be thoroughly healed, and the true intere&s;ts of Church and State may govern all denominations in their future conte&s;ts, and regu|late all their claims: They were de&s;igned to be mutual benefits; and if they were cordially united in the truth, we might be led forth in the right way of peace, by the hand of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> and <HI>Aaron.</HI> May the vir|tuous on both &s;ides endeavour, by all probable means, to remove all grounds of complaint, and re&s;tore equal liberties&mdash;If every one upright|ly con&s;idered his own happine&s;s as a part of the whole, and in&s;eperable from it, he would feel no di&s;po&s;ition to en&s;lave any. All would chear|fully &s;ubmit to a righteous government in church and &s;tate; for they would find all turn to general good, friend&s;hip and gratitude would be re&s;tored between Great-Britain and her Colonies, love and peace between the various denominations of prote&s;tant chri&s;tians.&mdash;Church and &s;tate would be mutual helps in this province; and as we are beautiful for &s;itu|ation&punc; we &s;hould &s;oon be the joy of the whole land. None would be taxed without his con&s;ent, to &s;upport a mini&s;try he con&s;cientiou&s;ly di&s;&s;ent|ed <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> The enemies would not roar in pari&s;hes, nor break down the carved work with axes and hammers; the &s;ame public &s;pirit would reign in all orders and conditions of men, which reigned in Chri&s;t Je&s;us.&mdash;If a <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> of Chri&s;tian benevolence was properly cultivated in all the different cla&s;&s;es, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>lines</HI> would not bind any one to pay their money to &s;upport a

wor&s;hip which they e&s;teemed corrupt, but where they could with peace and comfort &s;et down with their brethren; and this would not le&s;&s;en the extent of good order and plea&s;ure nor &s;horten their duration.</P>
<P>BUT when &s;hall this happy <HI>aera</HI> commence! Not in the STATE, as long as fleets and armies are palmed upon us, to threaten di&s;truction in a time of peace&mdash;Not as long as the parliament of Great-Britain &s;trive to tax us without our con&s;ent.</P>
<P>THE &s;hocking effects of the&s;e violent mea&s;ures we have already felt by the ever memorable tragical &s;cene at <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> four years ago! We mourn with our brethren, that the &s;ons of violence and blood were ever &s;uffered to parade the &s;treets of our Metropolis! We feel for them, who &s;aw their &s;treets &s;tained with INNOCENT BLOOD, by wor&s;e than butcher|ing Soldiers! Should the Lord arraign the blood-thir&s;ty crew as he did <HI>Cain,</HI> they might add rebellion to their other &s;in, as he did: But if they &s;hould hear GOD &s;ay, "What have you done! The voice of your bre|thren's blood crieth unto me from the ground;" they would be ready to cry, "Our puni&s;hment is greater than we can bear:" They would feel them&s;elves cut off from the church, and forbid to bring any more vain oblations, unpardoned guilt would fill their &s;ouls with continual terror. May the awful cata&s;trophe of that evening be ever deeply engraven up|on our hearts as it is this day!</P>
<P>I READILY own that I feel upon my mind a great aver&s;ion to all en|&s;laving mea&s;ures, and a &s;trong de&s;ire for public liberty. I wi&s;h to &s;ee all tho&s;e fetters which parliaments have endeavoured to fix upon us, done away. When will the time come, that fleets and armies &s;hall be <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">,
<PB N="14" REF="013513_0012_0F90A2F652B32F88">
and better employed than to threaten us with bondage and death! I could al&s;o wi&s;h for the peace and happine&s;s of the church; and there|fore, that all denominations of prote&s;tants might be at liberty to &s;eek their edification in tho&s;e wor&s;hiping a&s;&s;emblies with which they agree in &s;entiment, and be di&s;charged from mini&s;terial taxes to any but where they attend, as it is in this town, through the benevolent application of its inhabitants. We &s;ee many &s;ad con&s;equences of violence in the church; we have tried force long enough to convince us that we have no rea&s;on to be proud of the experiment. Methinks a <HI>collector</HI> has as much rea|&s;on to tremble at the face of an hone&s;t man when he demands his money or property in &s;uch a ca&s;e, as a thief would have at the &s;ight of a &s;heriff. What benefit has ever accrued to people by the plunder of hone&s;t men, who &s;oberly di&s;&s;ent from their brethren&mdash;the con&s;equence of &s;o much inju&s;tice has been to excite people to devi&s;e &s;everal &s;chemes to get rid of their fetters. Be&s;ides, it is attended with a general lo&s;s of credit and confidence in one another. It requires no great degree of virtue and wi&s;dom in a court to put a &s;top to &s;uch gains of ungodline&s;s.</P>
<P>BUT a &s;pirit of liberty is wanting, even among tho&s;e that are pleading for liberty&punc; and dread &s;lavery. The Church as well as the State mu&s;t be founded on principles of ju&s;tice, benevolence and moderation, or there can be no peace The wi&s;dom that is from above is fir&s;t PURE, then <HI>peace|able</HI>&mdash;but envy and &s;trife ari&s;e from beneath.</P>
<P>I PRESUME not to dictate the legi&s;lators of the people: But it is our duty as Mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t, to open the nature of ju&s;tice and oppre&s;&s;i|on We have a right to &s;ay that what any man can call <HI>his,</HI> mu&s;t re|main his, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> he agrees to part with it; and if it is taken away by <HI>force,</HI>
<PB N="15" REF="013513_0013_0F90A2F941BC88C8">
it is an act of inju&s;tice. Ju&s;tice will regulate the happine&s;s of church and &s;tate; but oppre&s;&s;ion will promote their mi&s;ery. By what bond &s;o|ciety and &s;ocial happine&s;s will be promoted, I know not, as long as they bite and devour one another.</P>
<P>RIGHTEOUSNESS and mercy are due to all men, e&s;pecially to tho&s;e with whom we are nearly connected. The law of nature and the writ|ten law of God, ought to be the great maxims of all civil and eccle&s;i|a&s;tical policy. It is truely &s;urpri&s;ing to ob&s;erve, how <HI>Slowly</HI> the prin|ciples of freedom prevail re&s;pecting the Church in a land &s;o warmly en|gaged for liberty in the <HI>State.</HI> It has been the policy of &s;ome, who are zealous for liberty, to lay their brethren under the &s;evere&s;t re&s;trictions on religious accounts, though doubtle&s;s if proper freedom was granted, the whole body would feel the ble&s;&s;ings of it; for the mo&s;t effectual me|thod of receiving good from others is to do good to them. Equal liber|ties granted to all denominations, would naturally tend to beget affecti|onate union. The time I am per&s;waded will come, when the re&s;traints laid upon &s;ome chri&s;tians, and the violence u&s;ed towards them will cea&s;e, and there will be as great freedom in the Church as we plead for in the &s;tate. It would be a noble effect of laudable ambition in our whole legi&s;|lative body, if they &s;hould follow their neighbours in this matter, or fix upon &s;ome better plan for relief. O that court and country may break through the prejudices and &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s of the age! O that all may be led into the right path to promote truth and &s;ocial happine&s;s! The path that would make the province peaceful among them&s;elves, and re&s;pectable a|mong others! But force and fraud will never effect this ble&s;&s;ing, thou<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters"> love and friend&s;hip might.

It would be a good means to convince them that we are contending for our rights and liberties, with a benevolent and chri&s;tian &s;pirit&mdash;by the armour of righ|teou&s;ne&s;s on the right hand and on the left, through the manife&s;tation of the truth; and that we dread the defence of liberty by external force&mdash; that nothing but meer nece&s;&s;ity &s;hall draw us into it.</P>
<P>BUT if the&s;e and other equitable mea&s;ures will not prevail over tho&s;e that would en&s;lave us, Chri&s;tian benevolence will in&s;pire us to &s;ecure our rights, and repair our injuries at the point of the &s;word; for if one man may defend him&s;elf and his rights again&s;t an a&s;&s;ailant, much more may a whole country defend them&s;elves when their rights are invaded, becau&s;e the concern is greater. In &s;uch ca&s;e, the &s;pirit of Chri&s;tian benevolence would animate us to fill our &s;treets with blood, rather than &s;uffer others to rob us of our rights. I readily grant that arms are a &s;ad remedy, and the more unde&s;irable where there has &s;ub&s;i&s;ted u&s;eful connections: But if old friends are di&s;po&s;ed to be terrible, if they endeavour to en&s;lave, and bring mi&s;chief and mi&s;ery upon their brethren, this is a fal&s;e notion of glory, and condemned by true religion. Then it becomes us to take up arms and u&s;e them in the nature of a remedy. Such coro&s;&s;ives are pain|ful, but the cau&s;es which make them nece&s;&s;ary are more dangerous. When nothing el&s;e will &s;erve to pre&s;erve or re&s;tore our liberties, it be|comes a duty to make u&s;e of arms&mdash;We de&s;ire liberty with peace, and would gladly live as friends, but if the ble&s;&s;ing of liberty cannot be had with peace, it is lawful and right to enter into a contrary &s;tate. If for|mer friend<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> now re&s;olved to entangle us with a yoke of bondage, God

forbid that we &s;hould &s;uffer them to cut off our limbs and mangle our whole body to gratify their injurious demands. Such terms of peace are no better than what <HI>Nahajh</HI> the <HI>Ammonite</HI> propo&s;ed to the men of <HI>Jabeth Gilead,</HI> that they would let him thru&s;t out their right eyes, and bring reproach up|on all I&s;rael, leaving them one eye to &s;erve him in &s;ome mean and &s;ervile drugery. If it &s;hould be &s;o that our natural and con&s;titutional liberties cannot be recovered and maintained without repelling force by force, who could he&s;itate for a moment, about the propriety of taking up arms! If our brethren will not be ea&s;y unle&s;s we &s;uffer them to thru&s;t out our right eyes, and en&s;lave our families, it is a very loud call from God, to de|fend our&s;elves from their encroachments: And if we go forth in the name and &s;trength of Chri&s;t, he will be our &s;un to guide and animate us, and our &s;hield to defend and give us &s;alvation.</P>
<P>IT is matter of deep lamentation that any of the mini&s;try at home, or a|ny pen&s;ioners and their tools in the Briti&s;h colonies &s;hould di&s;tre&s;s a tree people with any outward inconveniences from a &s;inful, imperious &s;pirit directly oppo&s;ite to the genius of the go&s;pel: It is a great pity that tho&s;e who are &s;o nearly connected in intere&s;t, and a long combination produc|tive of their common good and happine&s;s &s;hould be broken a&s;under by un|principled tyrants and traitors,&mdash;traitors to their King and to his loyal &s;ub|jects! They deeply offend him who has purcha&s;ed all our privileges, and who will &s;everely judge and condemn all tyrannizing over a free people. They cannot be ju&s;tly offended though in this open and undi&s;gui&s;ed way, I affirm they are acting over the old trade of per&s;ecution, rather than we &s;hould be free, and the methods of di&s;tre&s;s are calculated to prevent the
<PB N="15" REF="013513_0016_0F90A2FCF0B88CA8">
nation and colonies from being a flouri&s;hing people, &s;o long as the old connection la&s;ts. The &s;ame plan if it &s;hould prevail, will i&s;&s;ue in mo&s;t fatal con&s;equences. It has laid wa&s;te many flouri&s;hing countries, and mul|titudes, for liberties &s;ake, have been killed all the day long; the blood of martyrs have run like rivers down the &s;treets of famous cities; it has put others to cruel mockings, bonds, impri&s;onments and bani&s;hments. Yea it was the &s;ame principle that crucified the Lord of life and glory, And as the&s;e have been the &s;hocking con&s;equences of &s;uch principles pre|vailing in the church or &s;tate, the like may be acted over again, if the principles are not &s;ea&s;onably &s;uppre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>BUT &s;hould we &s;uffer ever &s;o many temporal inconveniences for it, yet, as Chri&s;tians, we may not give up tho&s;e rights and privileges that Chri&s;t has purcha&s;ed for and be&s;towed upon us; for giving them up, would not only reflect great di&s;honour upon Chri&s;t, but would be incon|&s;i&s;tent with the peace and welfare of the people, and therefore be quite intolerable. We hope that HE by whom Kings reign, and Princes de|cree ju&s;tice, will in&s;pire our DREAD SOVEREIGN with tho&s;e feelings of pity, humanity and goodne&s;s, which were very con&s;picuous in his ROYAL GRAND-FATHER; and di&s;po&s;e him to put a &s;peedy and final end to all tho&s;e mea&s;ures of de&s;poti&s;m, invented and propagated by a corrupt mini&s;try.</P>
<P>GOD grant, that we may &s;o conduct in our eccle&s;ia&s;tical concerns, as that all denominations of prote&s;tants may enjoy equal privileges. I am warranted to tell you, that it has been the opinion of good judges of our charter, that no denomination of prote&s;tants can be a legal e&s;tabli&s;h|ment
<PB N="19" REF="013513_0017_0F90A2FDA7D4DA88">
in the province, &s;o as to interfere with the freedom of another de|nomination: That if, by <HI>Pari&s;h lines,</HI> any of our laws bind men to pay toward the &s;upport of a mini&s;try from which they &s;oberly di&s;&s;ent, &s;uch laws will be judged a breach of charter, if the matter be properly repre|&s;ented home. I humbly apprehend that, in &s;uch a day of jealou&s;y as this is, all of us are called to con&s;ider whether there has not been a breach upon our Charter rights in this matter, for if the affair &s;hould be complained of, our own arbitrarine&s;s may &s;oon bring us into &s;lavery.</P>
<P>MAY that God, who loves righteou&s;ne&s;s, and hates violence and op|pre&s;&s;ion, di&s;po&s;e all orders of men among us, both in church and &s;tate, to put away the evil of our doings, &s;eek judgment, relieve the oppre&s;&s;|ed! If mutual benevolence and righteou&s;ne&s;s &s;hould reign among our|&s;elves, we may hope to enjoy the ble&s;&s;ing of liberty: but if we refu&s;e and rebel, we may ju&s;tly fear being devoured by the &s;word of tho&s;e that are watching to en&s;lave us.</P>
