<HEAD>Mr. <HI>WHITEFIELD</HI>'s JOURNAL FROM London <HI>to</HI> Gibraltar.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear Friends,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ACcording to your Reque&s;t, I have herewith &s;ent you an Account of what GOD has done for my Soul &s;ince I left <HI>England.</HI>&mdash; The &s;ole Motive (if my Heart doth not deceive me) which induced me to leave my native Country was a full Conviction that it was the Divine Will I &s;hould. What Rea&s;ons I can urge for this Per&s;ua&s;ion, is need|le&s;s to mention, becau&s;e few in this Ca&s;e would judge impartially, and what &s;eems a Rea&s;on to me, may not be deemed &s;o by another. Let it &s;uffice to in|form you, that after earne&s;t Prayer for a Year and a half, that if the De&s;ign was not of GOD, it might come to nought, tho' &s;trongly &s;ollicited to act in a contrary Manner, I found my&s;elf as eagerly bent on going abroad as ever.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="004631_0003_100DB1BFD0CAFB10">Accordingly, <HI>Wedne&s;day December</HI> 28, 1737, after having continued in&s;tant in Prayer with my Friends at Mr. <HI>J. H</HI>'s, and afterwards receiving the Holy Sacrament at St. <HI>Dun&s;tan</HI>'s, being recommend|ed to the Grace of GOD by a great Number of weep|ing Chri&s;tian Brethren at the Rev. Mr. <HI>H</HI>'s, I &s;et out at Night for <HI>Deptford</HI> in a Coach, accompanied by four Friends, and got there at Ten. Here a Widow Woman gladly received us in her Hou&s;e; and many of my Friends gave me the meeting, who came on Foot from <HI>London,</HI> with intent to accom|pany me to the Ship; and with them I took a little bodily Refre&s;hment; &s;pent two or three Hours in particular Interce&s;&s;ion for our Friends and Enemies, and all Mankind; &s;ung P&s;alms and Hymns and &s;pi|ritual Songs, and then betook our&s;elves to Re&s;t, and <HI>the LORD made us to dwell in Safety.</HI> [<HI>Oh who can expre&s;s the un&s;peakable Joy of religious Friends?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thur&s;day, Dec.</HI> 29. Ro&s;e early in the Morning, and continued in&s;tant in Interce&s;&s;ion, chanting and &s;inging of P&s;alms with my Friends till Nine, at which our Hearts were much rejoiced. After this we went in que&s;t of our Ship, but finding &s;he was fallen down to <HI>Purfleet,</HI> and was not to remove to <HI>Grave&s;end</HI> for &s;ome Time, we returned to <HI>Deptford</HI> prai&s;ing GOD, and praying for a Ble&s;&s;ing on our in|tended Voyage. <HI>The LORD perform all our Pe|titiion</HI>!</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> returned to <HI>Deptford</HI> with my friends, we dined comfortably together, joined in a P&s;alm, read
<PB N="5" REF="004631_0003_100DB1BFD0CAFB10">
the Le&s;&s;ons for the Day, and concluded with Prayer. Some were then obliged to depart for <HI>London.</HI> After they were gone, I continued with the re&s;t in parti|cular Interce&s;&s;ion for near two Hours, and then GOD was plea&s;ed to comfort my Heart. <HI>If parting from a few earthly Friends for a Sea&s;on be &s;o grievous, How will the Wicked bear to be parted from GOD and good Men for all Eternity.</HI></P>
<P>It happened providentially that a Lecture was to be preached that Evening at <HI>Deptford,</HI> and &s;everal importuned me to preach it. At fir&s;t I was fearful (O me of little Faith) having no Notes: But after|wards (having got the Con&s;ent of the Mini&s;ter) I went up, depending on the Promi&s;e, <HI>Lo I am with you always even unto the End of the World</HI>; and was enabled to preach to a large Congregation without the lea&s;t He&s;itation. <HI>Did any one yet ever tru&s;t in the LORD and was for&s;aken?</HI> What gave me a great Comfort, and made me more thankful, was, that the Opportunity, I believe, was granted, in an&s;wer to Prayer.</P>
<P><HI>Friday, Dec.</HI> 30. Went with our Baggage and nine or ten Friends in a <HI>Grave&s;end</HI> Boat to <HI>Purfleet,</HI> where the <HI>Whitaker</HI> was fallen down. Spent the Time we were on the Water in &s;inging P&s;alms and particular Interce&s;&s;ion; and came on board about Ten in the Morning.</P>
<P>I &s;poke &s;ome few Things to my new Charge, &s;pent the Remainder of the Day on Shore with my Friends, in &s;inging P&s;alms, Prayer, and exhorting
<PB N="6" REF="004631_0004_100DB1C16ECB2428">
one another to Love and good Works: Returned at Night to our Ship, and lay with my Friend <HI>H.</HI> upon the Ground in a Matre&s;s, in the great Cabbin: And GOD was plea&s;ed to give me a Proof that he was with me in the Ship.</P>
<P><HI>Saturday, Dec.</HI> 31. Began this Morning to have publick Prayers on open Deck, at which the Officer and Soldiers attended with Decency and Reverence. After Prayer I enlarged a little on tho&s;e Words of St. <HI>Paul, I am determined to know nothing among you &s;ave JESUS CHRIST and him crucified,</HI> told them how my future Conduct would be; made &s;ome Pro|fe&s;&s;ions of my hearty Love and &s;incere Affection for their Souls; and then di&s;mi&s;&s;ed them, I believe &s;omewhat moved. <HI>Oh, that I may have Grace to act &s;uitably to this Profe&s;&s;ion!</HI></P>
<P>To-day al&s;o I began to vi&s;it the Sick, and took that Opportunity of di&s;cour&s;ing on the Uncertainty of Life, and the Certainty of a future Judgment, to tho&s;e around me; and GOD was plea&s;ed not to let my Words fall to the Ground.</P>
<P>About Twelve, I went and paid my Friends a Vi&s;it, who were on Shore, and &s;pent two or three delightful Hours in prai&s;ing and ble&s;&s;ing GOD.</P>
<P>Soon came another Friend with two hone&s;t Men from <HI>Grave&s;end,</HI> de&s;iring me in the Name of the Mini&s;ter to come and preach to them the following Lord's Day: At fir&s;t I was unwilling to leave my own Flock in the Ship, but my Friends Rea&s;onings overbalanced mine, and I went on board, read pub|lick
<PB N="7" REF="004631_0004_100DB1C16ECB2428">
Prayers, vi&s;ited the Sick, gave the Soldiers an Exhortation, (at which the Solders were &s;urpri&s;ingly affected); and then took Boat with them for <HI>Grave&s;|end.</HI> My Heart was much enlarged in Interce&s;&s;ion. The Evening was exceeding calm, the Sky clear, and all Things con&s;pired to prai&s;e that glorious and lofty One that inhabits Eternity, who <HI>&s;tretcheth forth the Heavens like a Curtain, and holdeth the Waters in the Hollow of his Hand.</HI></P>
<P>About Seven at Night, GOD brought us &s;afe to <HI>Grave&s;end,</HI> where Mr. <HI>H.</HI> received both me and my Friends mo&s;t courteou&s;ly, and loaded us with many Benefits: <HI>The good LORD have Mercy on him in that Day.</HI></P>
<P>We &s;pent the Evening very agreeably in Prayer, and Singing, and then betook our&s;elves to Sleep, having before exhorted one another to prepare our Spices and Ointments of Prai&s;e and Thank&s;giving, and to re&s;t on the approaching Sabbath according to the Commandment.</P>
<P><HI>Sunday, January</HI> 1. Ble&s;&s;ed be GOD for the hap|py Beginning of a new Year! for it has been a Day of fat Things: We ro&s;e in the Morning, and retired to an adjacent. Hill with my Friends to Prayer; and afterwards were mo&s;t agreeably &s;urpri&s;ed with the Coming of &s;everal more <HI>London</HI> Friends (whom I love as my own Soul), who came all Night on the Water to &s;ee me.</P>
<P>About Ten we went to Church, where I preach'd; and the Curate was &s;o kind, at our Reque&s;t, as to give us the Sacrament.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="004631_0005_100DB1C4AB9107C8">In the Afternoon I preached again to a more nu|merous Congregation than in the Morning: And being to &s;tay there but one Lord's Day, I was pre&s;|&s;ed to preach and read Prayers a third Time, at Six in the Evening. It was a Thing I found entirely new; but upon the Curate's readily complying to lend the Pulpit, and my Friends and the People's Importunity, I looked upon it as a Call of Provi|dence, and accordingly read Prayers and preached to a very thronged Auditory; and this I did with|out Notes, having brought but two written Sermons with me. <HI>Oh! who can expre&s;s the loving Kindne&s;s of the LORD, or &s;hew forth all his Prai&s;e?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Monday, Jan.</HI> 2. 1737. 8. Sat up 'till Twelve at Night, to take leave of &s;ome of my Friends, who&s;e Bu&s;ine&s;s obliged them to be at <HI>London</HI> the next Morn|ing; and then, after three or four Hours Re&s;t, ro&s;e and walked to <HI>Greenhith</HI> with the Remainder of my Friends, intending to take a Boat there, and &s;o re|turn to my Charge at <HI>Purfleet.</HI> But ju&s;t as we were entring the Boat, providentially came a Boy, telling us, the <HI>Whitaker</HI> was falling down to <HI>Grave&s;end,</HI> and ready to &s;ail, if not actually under Sail; we imme|diately ha&s;ted back from whence we came, and went on our Way rejoicing.</P>
<P>About Eleven we reached <HI>Grave&s;end,</HI> and happily found the Ship was not to &s;ail till the morrow. This put Gladne&s;s into my Heart, as it gave me an Op|portunity of &s;ettling &s;ome Affairs of Con&s;equence, and conver&s;ing a little longer with my dear Friends.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="004631_0005_100DB1C4AB9107C8">About Twelve o'Clock I went on board, leaving my Friends to dine on Shore: And as I went along, GOD was plea&s;ed to &s;hew me he had given a Ble&s;|&s;ing to my Di&s;cour&s;es; the People &s;eemed greatly alarmed, and wi&s;hed me heartily a good Voyage, and the very Sailors were &s;urpri&s;ingly affectionate. <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed be GOD for &s;etting his Seal to my unworthy Mini&s;try!</HI> Spent the Remainder of the Day in &s;et|tling Things on board, vi&s;iting the Sick, teaching the Children, and reading Prayers, and Preaching. <HI>All Love, all Glory be to GOD through CHRIST!</HI></P>
<P>In the Evening I went on Shore again to my Friends, pray'd, &s;ung P&s;alms, and expounded (I think) a Chapter out of the holy Scriptures to them, and was not a little comforted. <HI>Prai&s;e the LORD, O my Soul!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Tue&s;day, Jan.</HI> 3. Went on board, read Prayers and Preached, vi&s;ited the Sick, and then took a final Leave, as I thought, of my Friends. Spent the Af|ternoon in writing Letters, and putting Things in Order. And (what I e&s;teemed a great Ble&s;&s;ing) tho' I had been u&s;ed to &s;o large a Sphere of Action, yet my Change of Life gave me not the lea&s;t Unea&s;i|ne&s;s, but my Heart was refre&s;hed with Joy un&s;peak|able, and full of Glory.</P>
<P>This Evening began to read Prayers between Decks, judging it would be too cold above.</P>
<P>At Night I went, according to Cu&s;tom, on Shore to <HI>Grave&s;end,</HI> where I was agreeably &s;urpri&s;ed by &s;eeing my Friends. I took leave of them in the
<PB N="10" REF="004631_0006_100DB1C6C55D7190">
Morning once more, the Weather preventing their going to <HI>London.</HI> Here al&s;o Mr. <HI>C. W.</HI> and Mr. <HI>W. H.</HI> gave me the meeting, with whom we pray'd, &s;ung P&s;alms, commended one another to GOD, and parted the next Morning like Chri&s;tian Brethren.</P>
<P> <HI>Wedne&s;day, Jan.</HI> 4. Came on board at Ten in the Morning; but could not have publick Prayers, be|cau&s;e the Soldiers were engaged with their Officer: But I vi&s;ited the Sick, and perceived the Soldiers were attentive to hear me, when I applied my&s;elf to tho&s;e around the &s;ick Per&s;ons. I al&s;o di&s;tributed among&s;t the Sick of my <HI>London</HI> Friends kind Pre|&s;ents, to convince them I had a Love for, and to gain an Acce&s;s to their Souls. I vi&s;ited the Sick, read Prayers, and preached <HI>extempore</HI> (as I con&s;tantly do Morning and Evening) and went with Mr. <HI>H.</HI> in the Evening on Shore to <HI>Grave&s;end,</HI> where we in|terceded for Friends, expounded a Chapter, and went to Bed, with <HI>that Peace of Mind which pa&s;&s;eth all Under&s;tanding. Oh that the &s;en&s;ual, carele&s;s, half Chri&s;tian could but know the Comforts of Religion!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thur&s;day, Jan.</HI> 5. This Day GOD was with me of a Truth: I was refre&s;hed in Spirit, by hearing from &s;ome <HI>London</HI> Friends, and receiving &s;ome kind Pre&s;ents from Per&s;ons I could never have thought of; was a&s;&s;i&s;ted much in writing Letters; came on board, read Prayers, and preached; vi&s;ited the Sick, and had GOD with me all Day long: Begun to cate|chi&s;e &s;ix or &s;even of the young Soldiers on open Deck. I was &s;urpri&s;ed they would &s;ubmit to it&punc;
<PB N="11" REF="004631_0006_100DB1C6C55D7190">
but GOD has the Hearts of all Men in his Hands.</P>
<P>Great Civility was &s;hewn me on board by the Officers; and Capt. <HI>W.</HI> &s;ent his Boat to fetch me to <HI>Grave&s;end,</HI> whither I went; having vi&s;ited the Sick, read Prayers, and preached on Deck.</P>
<P>When on Shore, I wrote &s;everal Letters, ex|pounded a Chapter to a Room full of People. Ca|techi&s;ed the Children of the Hou&s;e, and three of my own Companions, and then went to Bed, full of <HI>Peace and Joy in the Holy Gho&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>My Health of Body, I could perceive, increa&s;ed, and my Soul was much refre&s;hed. I now began once more to feel the Comforts of a retired Life, and ble&s;&s;ed GOD from my Heart, that he had called me whither I was going.</P>
<P><HI>Friday, Jan.</HI> 6. About Nine I came on board, read Prayers, and preached between Decks; and Mr. <HI>H.</HI> &s;ung a P&s;alm, as he generally does. In the mean while, the Ship loo&s;ed from <HI>Grave&s;end,</HI> and &s;ailed by Twelve o'Clock to the <HI>Nore.</HI> We had a very bri&s;k Gale of Wind.</P>
<P>GOD gave me great Comfort, and I went between Decks, and &s;ate down on the Ground, and read <HI>Arndt</HI>'s <HI>True Chri&s;tianity</HI>: And part of the Time I &s;tood upon Deck, and admired the Wonders of GOD in the Deep.</P>
<P>Three or four were added to-day to my Cate|chumens, &s;ome of whom I had great Hopes of Read Prayers, preached upon Deck near the Stern, (having no Place for Retirement;) talked to the
<PB N="12" REF="004631_0007_100DB1C89FD811B0">
Sailors on the Fore-Ca&s;tle; wrote my Journal; and climb'd up into my Cabbin to Bed, where my Friend <HI>H.</HI> and I &s;ay as comfortably as on a Bed of State.</P>
<P>Some of the Pa&s;&s;engers, among&s;t whom was Mr. <HI>H.</HI> began now to be &s;ick: But I felt very little of it; on the contrary GOD enabled me to rejoice with ex|ceeding great Joy; my Heart was warmed by talk|ing to the Sailors, and I was &s;o lifted even above my&s;elf, that I could have <HI>watched unto Prayer</HI> and Prai&s;e all Night.</P>
<P>I found that above an Hundred, exclu&s;ive of the Ship's Company, were on board; <HI>GOD grant that not one of them may peri&s;h through my Neglect.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Saturday, Jan.</HI> 7. Breakfa&s;ted with &s;ome of the Gentlemen in the Great Cabbin, who were very civil, and let me put in a Word for GOD.</P>
<P>Read publick Prayers, and began to expound the <HI>Lord</HI>'s <HI>Prayer</HI> to the Soldiers, by way of Ser|mon, and GOD enabled me to do it with Power. After that I in&s;tructed my Catechumens, who now amounted to twelve or thirteen. <HI>GOD made them Soldiers of</HI> CHRIST <HI>as well as of the King.</HI></P>
<P>Had an Hour's Conver&s;ation with a Gentleman on board, on our Fall in <HI>Adam,</HI> and the Nece&s;&s;ity of our New Birth in CHRIST JESUS, and hope it was not unplea&s;ant to him.</P>
<P>To-day obtained what I prayed for, <HI>viz.</HI> a Place to retire into: For Captain <HI>W.</HI> on my bare menti|oning my Want of &s;uch a thing, offered me the free U&s;e of his own Cabbin, a Place very commodious for that Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="004631_0007_100DB1C89FD811B0">Catechi&s;ed tho&s;e who went with me on open Deck, for Example to others, and found they improved. Captain <HI>W.</HI> the two Cadets, and Serieants, &s;at very &s;erious and attentive. But when the Captain of the Soldiers came, my Heart &s;unk a little (tho' without any Rea&s;on;) however I did not leave off. <HI>O Cor|ruption thou art my Si&s;ter!</HI></P>
<P>Read publick Prayers, and fini&s;hed my Expo&s;i|tion of the <HI>Lord's Prayer</HI> to the Soldiers, at which they attended very orderly. At Night I and my five Companions went upon Deck, and interceded and &s;ung P&s;alms, by which my Heart was much en|larged. The Weather was very cold, and the Wind magnified that GOD, <HI>at who&s;e Word the &s;tormy Wind ari&s;eth.</HI></P>
<P>Now I fulfilled my Promi&s;e to the LORD'S Peo|ple and while the Winds and Storms were blowing over me, I made earne&s;t Supplications to GOD for them.</P>
<P>The Ship continued at the <HI>Nore</HI> all this Day; but I hope we made &s;ome Advances towards Eternity.</P>
<P>In the Evening the Wind blew very fre&s;h indeed; and had our Ship been in the <HI>Downs,</HI> we &s;hould have been in great Danger. <HI>How wi&s;ely doth GOD provide for us!</HI> Mo&s;t People began now to be Sea|&s;ick, particularly <HI>J.D.</HI> one of my Companions was grievou&s;ly afflicted.</P>
<P><HI>Sunday, Jan.</HI> 8. My Friend <HI>H.</HI> and I have great Rea&s;on to be thankful to GOD; for we &s;lept as well as we could de&s;ire, though the Wind blew very hard,
<PB N="14" REF="004631_0008_100DB1CAB4D62B38">
 and the Sailors were very bu&s;y in taking care of the Ship, which by the Morning had dragged her An|chor two Miles.</P>
<P>Went early and vi&s;ited the Sea-&s;ick Soldiers and their Families between Decks, gave them &s;ome Sage-Tea and Sugar, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and excited them all to Thank|fulne&s;s and Repentance, out of Gratitude for their Pre&s;ervation from the la&s;t Night's Storm; and re|turned publick Thanks at Morning Prayers.</P>
<P>Thought much of my dear <HI>London</HI> Friends; tho' ab&s;ent in Body, was pre&s;ent in Spirit in &s;acred Or|dinances; and interceded for them and all Mankind mo&s;t &s;ervently. Read publick Prayers and preached twice to the Soldiers: and read Prayers once in the Great Cabbin to the Officers, at their Reque&s;t, which I liked very well: Catechi&s;ed my own Companions, but had not Time to catechi&s;e the Soldiers, on ac|count of attending the Sick.</P>
<P>To-day being the fir&s;t LORD's Day I have &s;pent this long time in &s;o private a manner, I could not avoid reflecting on the following Lines:</P>
<LG>
<L>I &s;igh whene'er my mu&s;ing Thoughts</L>
<L>Tho&s;e happy Days pre&s;ent,</L>
<L>When I with Troops of pious Friends</L>
<L>Thy Temple did frequent;</L>
<L>When I advanc'd with Songs of Prai&s;e,</L>
<L>My &s;olemn Vows to pay,</L>
<L>And led the joyful &s;acred Throng</L>
<L>That kept the Fe&s;tal Day.</L>
</LG>
<P><PB N="15" REF="004631_0008_100DB1CAB4D62B38">
But I con&s;idered it was the Divine Will that placed me here, and therefore I rejoiced. <HI>He is unworthy the Name of a Chri&s;tian, who is not as willing to hide him&s;elf when GOD commands, as to act in a publick Capacity.</HI></P>
<P>Began now to live a little by Rule, and to exa|mine into the Interiors of tho&s;e that came with me; which I found a mo&s;t u&s;eful Exerci&s;e both for them and me. Continued all this Day at the <HI>Nore,</HI> being quite becalmed; and at Night had a mo&s;t comforta|ble Interce&s;&s;ion for all Friends, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Monday, Jan.</HI> 9. Mr. <HI>H.</HI> began to learn <HI>Latin.</HI> Had near twenty Catechumens with my own Com|panions, who I believe made &s;ome Advances.</P>
<P>Weighed from the <HI>Nore,</HI> and &s;ailed before the Wind in Company with &s;everal others, which car|ried us on &s;o bri&s;kly, that we anchor'd before <HI>Mar|gate</HI> about One. Here I enjoyed a wi&s;hed for Op|portunity of writing to &s;ome of my <HI>London</HI> Friends, and found my Heart greatly enlarged towards them.</P>
<P>After Dinner having &s;ome Nece&s;&s;aries to buy, Mr. <HI>H.</HI> and I went on Shore to <HI>Margate.</HI> The Wind blew very fre&s;h, and <HI>the Sea raged horribly, but He that dwelleth on high was mightier,</HI> and kept us from the lea&s;t Fright, and filled me with great Joy, and brought us &s;afe on Shore. We had the mo&s;t abandoned Man with us I ever &s;aw, who came out of an <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Ship: He had &s;o much of the Devil in him, that the very Boat Men, profane as they were, abhorr'd him. From whence I infer, that
<PB N="16" REF="004631_0009_100DB1CD27097050">
was the Devil him&s;elf to appear as he is, the wicked|e&s;t Sinners could not but dete&s;t him.</P>
<P>This Afternoon I began to feel the Power of Faith more than ever I did before, and to find that as the Day, &s;o will our Strength be. When I went into the Boat the Sea run dangerou&s;ly high; but I could boldly &s;ay:</P>
<LG>
<L>GOD is our Refuge in Di&s;tre&s;s,</L>
<L>A pre&s;ent Help when Dangers pre&s;s;</L>
<L>In Him undaunted we'll confide,</L>
<L>Tho' Earth were from her Center to&s;s'd,</L>
<L>And Mountains in the Ocean lo&s;t,</L>
<L>Torn piecemeal by the roaring Tide.</L>
</LG>
<P>About Five we got &s;afe to <HI>Margate,</HI> where ha|ving received a little bodily Refre&s;hment, and re|commended our &s;elves to GOD in Prayer, we went about the Town to buy the Things we came for. The Generality of the People we met with were civilized and teachable.</P>
<P>After we had done our &s;ecular Bu&s;ine&s;s, we paid the Curate a Vi&s;it, the Mini&s;ter being at <HI>Canterbury:</HI> He received us mo&s;t courteou&s;ly: Our Conver&s;ation was &s;uch as tended to the U&s;e of Edifying; it ran chiefly upon the great Importance of the Mini&s;terial Function; the Nece&s;&s;ity of Preaching up the Doc|trine of the New Birth; and the Nece&s;&s;ity and Be|nefit of Vi&s;iting from Hou&s;e to Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>About Ten we left him, greatly refre&s;hed in Spi|rit, and thankful to GOD for exciting Per&s;ons every where to entertain us.</P>

<P><HI>Tue&s;day, Jan.</HI> 10. About Four this Morning, Mr. <HI>H.</HI> and I aro&s;e, intending to go on board immedi|ately; but the Wind blew &s;o very violent, that by the Advice of the Boat-Men we deferred going on board 'till Daylight; and therefore after we had kneeled on the Shore, and prayed for our&s;elves and others, we went back to the Inn; and took that Op|portunity of writing to a Friend, or two.</P>
<P>About Seven we took Boat and prai&s;ed and ble&s;|&s;ed GOD to &s;ee the Floods clap their Hands. About Eight we came on board, and found we had great Rea&s;on to be thankful that we were on Shore la&s;t Night: The Sailors told us that the Lightning &s;hone on the Sea all Night; and that the Storm was very great, and the Ship's Long-Boat was lo&s;t.</P>
<P>I read publick Prayers, returned publick Thanks for our Deliverance, and expounded by Way of Ser|mon the Second Article of the <HI>Creed,</HI> which I began Ye&s;terday. Did the &s;ame after Evening Prayers. Spent the Remainder of the Day in writing Letters; and have not enjoy'd a more calm delightful Frame of Mind a long Time.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="004631_0010_100DB1CEE05D8D90"> The Sick encrea&s;ed on my Hands, but were very thankful for furni&s;hing them with Sage-Tea, Sugar, Broth, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> At the Sight of &s;o many Objects of Pity, I was &s;en&s;ibly touched with a fellow feeling of their Mi&s;eries.

<P>Had a mo&s;t comfortable Sen&s;e of the Divine Pre|&s;ence with me in many Particulars: And in the Evening, joined in Interce&s;&s;ion with my other Com|panions on Deck, in Behalf of ab&s;ent Friends and all Mankind.</P>
<P><HI>Wedne&s;day, Jan.</HI> 11. Weighed from <HI>Margate</HI> Road, and ca&s;t Anchor in the <HI>Downs,</HI> the Ship &s;ail|ing mo&s;t plea&s;antly before the Wind. Wrote &s;eve|ral Letters whil&s;t the Ship was under Sail. Had my Spirits mightily refre&s;hed upon our Arrival in the <HI>Downs,</HI> by hearing from two or three Chri&s;tian Bre|thren at <HI>London;</HI> and was de&s;irous to ble&s;s GOD for a providential Opportunity that was offered of &s;end|ing a whole Packet to them and &s;ome other Friends, to acquaint them how lovingly the LORD had dealt with me. <HI>O that the Mercies be&s;towed on me, may through the Thank&s;giving of many redound to the Glory of GOD.</HI></P>
<P>Had no publick Prayers this Morning, being much hurried in writing Letters to go by Po&s;t; and when I went to read, the Soldiers were engaged in their military Affairs upon Deck, &s;o that I did no|thing
<PB N="19" REF="004631_0010_100DB1CEE05D8D90">
thing but vi&s;it the Sick. I fear I did fooli&s;hly&punc; <HI>Father, forgive me for thy dear Son's &s;ake.</HI></P>
<P>Went on in explaining the Creed after Evening Prayers, and was enabled to talk of the Crucifixion of our LORD: I believe it pricked them to the Heart. <HI>O that I could hear them cry out, What &s;hall we do to be &s;aved?</HI></P>
<P>Had the Comfort to hear good was done among the Soldiers; and the Captain was plea&s;ed to ex|pre&s;s his Approbation of my Conduct. <HI>GOD grant I may with a &s;ingle Eye &s;eek to plea&s;e the Captain of my Salvation!</HI></P>
<P>After Evening Prayers and vi&s;iting the Sick, went a&s;hore with Mr. <HI>H.</HI> to <HI>Deal</HI>; and was &s;o highly delighted with a Pro&s;pect of the <HI>Downs,</HI> that we expre&s;&s;ed our Thankfulne&s;s in &s;inging of P&s;alms all the Way. The Boat-Men I believe wondered at it at fir&s;t; but they were not a&s;hamed to <HI>bla&s;pheme,</HI> and I thought had no Rea&s;on to be a&s;hamed to <HI>prai&s;e</HI> GOD. I had the Satisfaction before we got to <HI>Deal,</HI> to hear one of them join &s;eriou&s;ly with us; and per|ceived a &s;urpri&s;ing Alteration in their Behaviour always after, <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed be GOD</HI>!</P>
<P>About Five we got to <HI>Deal,</HI> and not knowing a &s;ingle Per&s;on, went (as at <HI>Margate</HI>) to pay my Re|&s;pects to the two Mini&s;ters of the Place: But find|ing neither of them at Home, &s;pent the Remainder of the Evening with my Friend <HI>H.</HI> very comforta|bly in religious Talk, Family Prayer, interceding for ab&s;ent Friends and all Mankind, and writing to
<PB N="20" REF="004631_0011_100DB1D0F2098A30">
Chri&s;tian Brethren. And even here GOD did not leave my Mini&s;try without a Witne&s;s; for he was plea&s;ed to impre&s;s &s;omething I &s;aid on a poor Wo|man's Heart, that providentially came in, and joined with us in Family Prayer: for which we endea|voured to thank him. <HI>Behold how great a Fire this little Spark kindled before we left</HI> Deal!</P>
<P><HI>Thur&s;day, Jan.</HI> 12. Spent mo&s;t of the Morning in writing Letters: Went about Eleven on board&punc; and was highly delighted with the Pro&s;pect on the <HI>Downs,</HI> which was exceeding calm; and a great ma|ny beautiful Ships which were riding here added to the Pro&s;pect. <HI>O that Men who occupy their Bu&s;ine&s;s in the great Waters, would (&s;ince they cannot but &s;ee) admire GOD's Wonders in the Deep!</HI></P>
<P>Read Prayers and went on explaining the <HI>Creed</HI> to the Soldiers; vi&s;ited and prayed with the Sick; and began this Afternoon to explain the <HI>Catechi&s;m</HI> to the Women by them&s;elves: I find they are in Number about &s;ixteen; and ble&s;&s;ed be GOD were much affected. <HI>Pro&s;per thou, O LORD, this Work of my Hands upon me!</HI></P>
<P>Had &s;ome religious Talk with the Surgeon of the Soldiers, who &s;eems very well di&s;po&s;ed. I &s;el|dom (it ever) &s;ee him idle, and find he has many good Qualities. <HI>GOD grant Chri&s;tianity may be grafted in him!</HI></P>
<P>After Evening Prayers and explaining the <HI>Creed,</HI> went again to <HI>Deal</HI> with Mr. <HI>H.</HI> to buy &s;ome Ne|ce&s;&s;aries for our Companions. Spent the Remain|der
<PB N="21" REF="004631_0011_100DB1D0F2098A30">
of the Evening in writing Letters, and reading and praying with eight or nine poor People, who came I &s;uppo&s;e at the Report of the other poor Wo|man to hear me.</P>
<P><HI>Friday, Jan.</HI> 13. Remained all Day on Shore, the Weather being too rough to go on board: Was in Care about leaving my Flock &s;o long; but hope this &s;hort Ab&s;ence will make our Meeting more agreeable To-morrow. Had the Plea&s;ure of joining in publick Work&s;hip at <HI>Deal,</HI> in a pretty Chapel; which was more agreeable on account of our being confined for &s;ome Time within the narrow Limits of a Ship.</P>
<P>Set apart this Day as a Day of Humiliation, Ab|&s;tinence, and Interce&s;&s;ion for Friends and all Man|kind, and found my Heart greatly enlarged in that divine Exerci&s;e. <HI>Interce&s;&s;ion is a glorious Means to &s;weeten the Heart!</HI></P>
<P>Spent the Remainder of the Day, and &s;at up till One in the Morning in writing to Friends.</P>
<P>Had two or three added to my Company at Night, who &s;eemed very attentive, and prayed for me mo&s;t heartily. <HI>The Poor receive the Go&s;pel.</HI> I di&s;per&s;ed &s;ome Books among them, as I &s;aw proper: <HI>I hope GOD will give them his Ble&s;&s;ing.</HI></P>
<P>Expected Letters to night from <HI>London,</HI> but was di&s;appointed: <HI>GOD enable me in every thing to give Thanks!</HI></P>
<P>Fancied my&s;elf all this Day in my little Cell at <HI>Oxford</HI>: For I have not &s;pent &s;o many Hours in
<PB N="22" REF="004631_0012_100DB1D359A87758">
&s;weet Retirement &s;ince I left the Univer&s;ity. The Plea&s;ure I felt was inexpre&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P><HI>Saturday, Jan.</HI> 14. Spent the Morning in writing Letters, and was much plea&s;ed with the pious Con|ver&s;ation of a poor Woman, who was one of my Auditors la&s;t Night, and who I believe, has pa&s;&s;ed through the Pangs of the New Birth.</P>
<P>Ha&s;ted on board about Eleven, (the Wind pro|mi&s;ing fair) to take us out of the Channel, and was affectionately received by the People.</P>
<P>I was greatly delighted to &s;ee all the Ships &s;ail together from the <HI>Downs.</HI> Nature, indeed, would have been glad to have &s;taid till the Morrow, that I might have received Letters from my <HI>London</HI> Friends, but God, I con&s;idered, ordereth all Things for the Good of tho&s;e that love him, and therefore gave Thanks from my Heart. Examined into the State of my little Ones, (my Friend <HI>H</HI>'s Charge) and had Rea&s;on to hope well of them.</P>
<P>Was enlarged in preaching after Prayers to the Soldiers, and &s;pent two mo&s;t plea&s;ant Hours in read|ing GOD's holy Word. At Night, though it was piercingly cold, we continued in&s;tant in Interce&s;&s;ion on Deck; and the Pro&s;pect of a clear Sky, the Stars glittering, and the Moon &s;hining bright warmed my Heart, and made me <HI>greatly rejoice in Spirit.</HI> I now began to be more reconciled to a Ship Life; for GOD gave me Health of Body, and without which all is nothing, Content ot Mind. Had near an Hour's Conver&s;ation with one who, I hope, will be|come

come an altogether Chri&s;tian. <HI>Oh that that ble&s;&s;ed Time would come.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sunday, Jan.</HI> 15. GOD gave me and Mr. <HI>H.</HI> &s;weet Sleep. Had near two Hours Retirement in the Captain's round Hou&s;e, and was much delighted with &s;inging P&s;alms on Deck with my Companions. Read publick Prayers in the Cabbin this Morning, and was much enlarged in preaching to the Soldiers on this Article, <HI>I believe in the Holy Gho&s;t:</HI> In treat|ing of which, I took Occa&s;ion to &s;hew the Nature and Nece&s;&s;ity of the New Birth; a Subject on which I delight to dwell.</P>
<P>Catechi&s;ed the Soldiers, and, ble&s;&s;ed be GOD, find &s;ome of them improved. Was enlarged again in my Evening Sermon to the Soldiers, and had Prayers a &s;econd Time in the great Cabbin, which gave me no &s;mall Satisfaction; the Officers, <HI>&amp;c,</HI> willingly comply'd as &s;oon as I impo&s;ed it; <HI>GOD be praised!</HI></P>
<P>Had great Delight in reading the Holy Scrip|tures, enjoyed an un&s;peakable Peace of Mind, and was much comforted in interceding for Friends, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> on Deck. The Weather was cold, and the Wind blew very hard; but when the Heart is full of GOD, outward Things affect it little. <HI>Surely my Friends in</HI> England <HI>pray for me; methinks I feel they do.</HI></P>
<P>All the Day the Sea was entirely becalmed; eve|ry thing about us &s;eem hu&s;h'd quiet, as though it would remind us of that &s;acred Re&s;t the Day was &s;et apart to commemorate. In the Evening the
<PB N="24" REF="004631_0013_100DB1D6F1010B40">
Wind blew very fre&s;h but being full again&s;t us, we were obliged to &s;ail back to the <HI>Downs</HI> (though we had got near fifty Miles) where we arrived about Twelve a Clock.</P>
<P><HI>Monday, Jan.</HI> 16. After private Prayer, was mo&s;t agreeably entertained with &s;ome Letters from my <HI>London</HI> Friends, which filled my Soul with un&s;peaka|ble Plea&s;ure, and cau&s;ed me to &s;hed Tears of Joy. <HI>If the Corre&s;pondence of good People is &s;o tran&s;porting here, O! how un&s;peakably revi&s;hing mu&s;t the Per&s;onal Communion of Saints be hereafter. Ha&s;ten, O LORD, that ble&s;&s;ed Time and let thy Kingdom come.</HI></P>
<P>Was a little affected by &s;eeing a poor Soldier tied Neck and Heels, for &s;everal mutinous Words he had &s;poken. The Captain related the Ca&s;e to me, and &s;aid, if I could make him &s;en&s;ible of his Crime, I might beg him off. I endeavoured to do it, but, alas, in vain; he continued ob&s;tinate, and thereby hindred my De&s;ign taking Effect. After this, the Captain order'd him to be tied down between Decks; from whence I took Occa&s;ion, in my Morning Ser|mon, to exhort the Soldiers to obey them That <HI>had the Rule over them,</HI> and to avoid tho&s;e Sins, that would provoke GOD to command them to be <HI>tied Hand and Foot, and to be ca&s;t into outer Darkne&s;s, where would be weeping and gna&s;hing of Teeth.</HI></P>
<P>About Twelve, a <HI>Deal</HI> Boat coming along Side, I was minded to go on Shore to an&s;wer my Letters. The Sea was very boi&s;terous, but God brought us to Shore rejoicing. <HI>O wherefore did I in the lea&s;t fear? What am I, when left to myself.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="004631_0013_100DB1D6F1010B40">It being the 16th Day of the Month, Mr. <HI>H.</HI> and I joined in an Hour's Interce&s;&s;ion and Ab&s;tinence, with all tho&s;e that meet together to bewail thier own and the Sins of the Nation. About Four, took &s;ome bodily Refre&s;hment; and from thence till One in the Morning, continued an&s;wering my Corre&s;pon|dents, having fir&s;t &s;pread their Letters before the LORD in Prayer, and begg'd that I might &s;end them An&s;wers of Peace.</P>
<P><HI>Tuesday, Jan.</HI> 17. Was awaken'd with an Alarm, that the Ship was ready to &s;ail, but found it soon con|tradicted. Spent an Hour in particular Interce&s;&s;ion, and the rest of the Morning in writing Letters, and teaching Mr. <HI>H.</HI> Latin. <HI>Oh that I may be made an In&s;trument of breeding him up for GOD!</HI></P>
<P>Came on board about Two in the Afternoon, and found all Things quiet in the Ship, was mo&s;t kindly recieved; and I ob&s;erved the Women were very at|tentive when I proceeded to explain the Catechi&s;m to them. <HI>May GOD open their Hearts as he did that of</HI> Lydia, <HI>that the&s;e may give diligent Heed to the Things that are &s;poken.</HI></P>
<P>Was much enlarged in my Evening Di&s;cour&s;e, and hope the Word entered into their Hearts. Was kindly invited by the Po&s;t Ma&s;ter of <HI>Deal,</HI> to lye at his Hou&s;e. Gained an Opportunity, by walking at Night on Deck, after Interce&s;&s;ion, to talk clo&s;ely to the chief Mate, and one of the Serjeants of the Re|giment, and hope my Words were not altogether &s;poken in vain. <HI>O that all Men would come to the
<PB N="26" REF="004631_0014_100DB1D97A658A08">
Knowledge of the Truth, and be &s;aved!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Wednesday, Jan.</HI> 18. Spent all the Morning in Retirement, reading the Scriptures, publick Prayer and preaching; the Weather being extremely plea|&s;ant.</P>
<P>Began to live by Rule more than ever; for no|thing I find is to be done without it. All that had been &s;ick being recovered, came to Prayers, for whom I gave Thanks; particularly to them: At the End of my Sermon exhorting them with the ut|mo&s;t Earne&s;tne&s;s, to <HI>Sin no more lea&s;t a wor&s;e Evil &s;hould befal them,</HI> and to &s;hew forth their Thankful|ne&s;s, not only with their Lips, but in their Lives <HI>O that there may be always in them &s;uch a Mind!</HI></P>
<P>Fini&s;hed my Exposition on the <HI>Creed.</HI> Read pub|lick Prayers, and preached as u&s;ual in the Afternoon Catechi&s;ed both my own Companions and the Sol|diers; and was plea&s;ed to &s;ee many others very at|tentive to hear</P>
<P>Had great Comfort in reading the Scriptures Was afterwards a little inclined to Heavine&s;s, but drove it off by a long Interce&s;&s;ion. <HI>Prayer is an Antidote again&s;t every Evil.</HI></P>
<P>Upon Examination, had Rea&s;on to hope my Com|panions grew in Grace; <HI>ble&s;&s;ed be GOD for it!</HI></P>
<P>About Eleven at Night went and &s;at down among the Sailors in the Steerage, and rea&s;oned with them <HI>about Righteou&s;ne&s;s, Temperance, and a Judgement to come</HI>; at which &s;ome of them almo&s;t <HI>trembled.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thur&s;day, Jan.</HI> 19. Was much comforted by hear|ing
<PB N="27" REF="004631_0014_100DB1D97A658A08">
from my Friends. Began, after Prayers this Morning, to explain the Catechi&s;m to the Soldiers, and draw proper Inferences by way of Sermon: I find it is much approved of, and, for them, by far the fitte&s;t Way of In&s;truction.</P>
<P>Spent the Afternoon in an&s;wering Corre&s;pondents; was much a&s;&s;i&s;ted in my Evening Expo&s;ition on the Catechi&s;m; and had great Hopes of two Soldiers becoming Chri&s;tians indeed. <HI>Would to GOD, all the King's Soldiers were &s;uch!</HI></P>
<P>Was enabled to compo&s;e a great Part of a new Sermon this Evening. Enlarged in Interce&s;&s;ion, and Afterwards much rejoiced by three more Letters, and &s;at up till One in the Morning to an&s;wer them. <HI>What&s;over thou finde&s;t in thy Hand to do,</HI> &s;aith the wi&s;e Man, <HI>do it with all thy Might.</HI></P>
<P>We had now &s;uch a calm and &s;mooth Sea, that all the People every where expre&s;&s;ed their Admiration of it. <HI>GOD grant that we may in a Calm provide for a Storm, and, like the primitive Chri&s;tians, when the Churches had Re&s;t, walk in the Comforts of the Holy Gho&s;t, and be edified!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Friday, Jan.</HI> 20. Ro&s;e with great Peace of Mind,
&s;pent all the Morning in compo&s;ing a Sermon.</P>
<P>Happily compo&s;ed a Difference between a Sol|dier and his Wife, who were one of the four Couple I married when fir&s;t I came on board: The Man had re&s;olved to leave her, but upon my reminding him of his Marriage Vow, and entreating him with Love, he immediately took to her again. <HI>What
<PB N="28" REF="004631_0015_100DB1DB9162F938">
may not a Mini&s;ter do through Chri&s;t, when his Flock love him?</HI> Almo&s;t fini&s;hed the Sermon I began Ye&s;terday, <HI>ble&s;&s;ed of GOD!</HI></P>
<P>Went on in expounding the <HI>Catechi&s;m</HI> after Even|ing Prayer; and now began to read the fir&s;t Le&s;&s;on, which I purpo&s;ely omitted before, not knowing they would bear it, and willing to imitate <HI>Jacob, who was careful of his little Ones not to over drive them.</HI></P>
<P>Propo&s;ed to the Captain to read a few Prayers in the Great Cabbin every Night, which he really con|&s;ented to, and withal &s;aid, he &s;hould be glad to hear me preach, whenever I &s;hould think proper.</P>
<P>Was &s;urpri&s;ed in the mid&s;t of my Evening's Di&s;|cour&s;e by the chief Mate, who came and told me, that the Mini&s;ter of <HI>Upper Deal</HI> had &s;ent a Boat for me, de&s;iring me immediately to come on Shore. Accordingly, after I had concluded, Mr. <HI>H.</HI> and I went and found the Mini&s;ter, which was left to of|ficiate, who de&s;ired me, at the Reque&s;t of the Inha|bitants, to preach the <HI>Sunday</HI> following. After this, we retired to our Lodging in <HI>Deal</HI>; and after a Ser|mon and long Interce&s;&s;ion, was un&s;peakably com|forted by the Reception of &s;everal Letters from Per|&s;ons, who, I believe &s;incerely fear GOD. At which my Heart was &s;o full, that I could not but kneel down, pray, and return Thanks to GOD for them.</P>
<P>Found the Number of my Hearers greatly in|crea&s;ed to-night, and very joyful to &s;ee me once more on Shore. I &s;ate up till One in the Morning, an|&s;wering my Corre&s;pondents, and then laid down,
<PB N="29" REF="004631_0015_100DB1DB9162F938">
filled with &s;uch <HI>Joy as no Man could take from me, nor a Stranger intermeddle with. Oh that all Men knew the Comforts of Religion.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Saturday, Jan.</HI> 21. Spent all the Day in writing Letters, and delightful Conver&s;ation with Mr. <HI>H.</HI></P>
<P>At Night, the Number of my Hearers was &s;o in|crea&s;ed, that the Stairs were full, as well as my Room. I expounded to them the 25th of St. <HI>Matthew,</HI> at which they were much affected, and &s;eemed to love and pray for me mo&s;t earne&s;tly: <HI>And I de&s;ire to have no greater Portion than the Prayers of the Poor.</HI></P>
<P>Sate up till One, writing Letters; gave Thanks for the Ble&s;&s;ing of the Week, and then lay down in Peace, hoping to ri&s;e early the next Morning, more fit for my Ma&s;ter's Service.</P>
<P><HI>Sunday, Jan.</HI> 22. About Nine went on board with Capt. <HI>W.</HI> who is always extremely civil. Vi&s;ited the Sick, and read Prayers in the Great Cabbin. Read Prayers, and preached my Sermon on <HI>Early Piety,</HI> on open Deck to the Soldiers; the Officers, and other Gentlemen, attending very &s;eriou&s;ly. The Weather was very cold, <HI>but Preaching warmed my Heart.</HI></P>
<P>About Noon went on Shore with Capt. <HI>W.</HI> and Mr. <HI>H.</HI> Dined at the Po&s;t-Ma&s;ter's, who received us ho&s;pitably. Afternoon preached at <HI>Upper Deal,</HI> on <HI>Acts</HI> xxviii. 26. Many &s;eemed pricked to the Heart, and &s;ome &s;o quickened, that they expre&s;&s;ed a De&s;ire to follow me wherever I &s;hould go. <HI>O free Grace in JESUS CHRIST!</HI> I have &s;carce known a
<PB N="30" REF="004631_0016_100DB1DE6005E040">
Time I have preached any where, but I have &s;een &s;ome Effect of my Doctrine. <HI>From the Hearts of the Mighty the Word of the LORD hath not turned back, the Sword of the Spirit returned not empty.</HI> A Proof this, I hope, that the Words are not my own, but that GOD is with me of a Truth: <HI>May I never, by Pride and Vain Glory, provoke him to depart from me!</HI></P>
<P>Stayed all Night on Shore, to expound the <HI>Lord's Prayer,</HI> and had a large Company to hear me, and &s;hould have had &s;even Hundred, as my Ho&s;te&s;s told me, would the Hou&s;e have held them: <HI>So &s;wiftly run the Word of GOD and prevailed.</HI></P>
<P>Was again refre&s;hed by receiving five Letters: Sat up till pa&s;t Ten, to an&s;wer &s;ome of them; and then went to Re&s;t, with comfortable Reflections of GOD's unmerited loving Kindne&s;s to me.</P>

<P><HI>Monday, Jan.</HI> 23. Was much comforted by re|ceiving five more Letters; an&s;wered &s;ome of them; and about Eleven in the Morning went on board the <HI>Amy,</HI> to pay my Re&s;pects to Colonel C. and to vi&s;it
<PB N="31" REF="004631_0016_100DB1DE6005E040">
the Soldiers, whom I looked upon as Part of my Charge. I was received very civilly by the Offi|cers; went among the Soldiers, enquired into the State of their Souls, gave them a Word or two of Exhortation; promi&s;ed to bring them &s;ome Books [I &s;aw their Wants], and (at the Officer's Reque&s;t) to come and preach to them, if Opportunity &s;hould offer, before we left the <HI>Downs.</HI></P>
<P>After this, I vi&s;ited the <HI>Lightfoot,</HI> our other Tran&s;|port Ship, in which were about twelve Soldiers and a Serjeant: they received me kindly. I &s;at down and conver&s;ed with them; promi&s;ed to &s;end them &s;ome Books, and to come and preach to them al&s;o, if Providence &s;hould permit. The <HI>Downs</HI> being ex|ceeding calm, and the Weather clear, going from Ship to Ship was very plea&s;ant. <HI>Mine are but little Flocks, O that it may be my heavenly Father's good Plea&s;ure to give them the Kingdom.</HI></P>
<P>About Two went again on board the <HI>Amy,</HI> to dine with the Officers, being kindly invited by them when I was before on board: They all treated me with great Kindne&s;s, and in the mid&s;t of our Meal was mo&s;t agreeably &s;urpri&s;ed by the coming of two <HI>Lon|don</HI> Friends, who made a Journey from thence <HI>(O unmerited Love)</HI> on purpo&s;e to &s;ee me.</P>
<P>Dinner being ended, I went and di&s;per&s;ed &s;ome Books among the Soldiers; took my Leave and ha&s;tened on board my own Ship; read Prayers and preached, and then went on Shore with my Friends, not being a little rejoiced to &s;ee them.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="004631_0017_100DB1E1F2C40478"> <HI>Jan.</HI> 23. This Night GOD let me &s;ee greater Things than before, for &s;o many came to hear me that the poor Landlady that owned the Hou&s;e where I lodged &s;ent to her Tenants, be&s;eeching them to let no more come in for fear the Floor &s;hould break under them; and indeed there were &s;uch Numbers that I fir&s;t expounded the Creed to about eighty, and then the &s;econd Le&s;&s;on to as many more; among whom I ob&s;erved there were many of the chief In|habitants.</P>
<P>About Eleven they went, and I then rejoiced with my Friends for what GOD had done for my Soul, eat a little Food, interceded for ab&s;ent Friends, and all Mankind, and went to Bed about Two in the Morning. <HI>O what &s;hall I render unto the LORD for all the Mercies he pours down upon me!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Tue&s;day, Jan.</HI> 24. Spent all the Morning in wri|ting Letters, walking, &s;inging of P&s;alms, and Inter|ce&s;&s;ion all along the Sea Shore, from whence we had a mo&s;t delightful Pro&s;pect of the <HI>Downs,</HI> which af|forded me and my Friends mo&s;t noble Matter for Prai&s;e and Thank&s;giving. Met with a little Oppo|&s;ition to day; but I &s;hould have wondered indeed, if &s;uch an effectual Door had been opened for <HI>preaching Chri&s;t,</HI> and there had been no Adver&s;a|ries. Nothing has done more Harm to the Chri|&s;tian Church than thinking the Examples recorded in the Holy Scriptures, were written only to be read and not imitated by us.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="004631_0017_100DB1E1F2C40478">More People came to hear me to Night than ever, &s;o that I divided them into two Companies again, and providentially from the &s;econd Le&s;&s;on for the Morning, had a glorious Opportunity for &s;hew|ing the ab&s;olute Unlawfulne&s;s of running or buying Run Goods, a Sin that doth mo&s;t ea&s;ily be&s;et the <HI>Deal</HI> People.</P>
<P>After Expo&s;ition paid Mr. <HI>E.</HI> a Vi&s;it, who mo&s;t kindly entertained us, and offered me his Boat to go or come on Shore when I plea&s;ed, which would &s;ave me much Expence. After we returned from his Hou&s;e, we kneeled down on the Sea Shore, and prayed for them that oppo&s;ed them&s;elves, and then went to Bed, ble&s;&s;ing and prai&s;ing GOD.</P>
<P><HI>Wedne&s;day, Jan.</HI> 25. Went on board in the Morn|ing with my Friends, intending to read Prayers and preach to the Soldiers, but they were engaged about their own Affairs, and I could not &s;tay long.&mdash; Had great Civilities &s;hewed us by the Officers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> who treated my Friends re&s;pectfully, and the Captain, upon my Reque&s;t, pardoned a Woman who other|wi&s;e was to have been &s;ent on Shore.</P>
<P>After Breakfa&s;t, return'd on Shore with my Friends, and read Prayers, and preached at <HI>Upper-Deal</HI> to a large Congregation; I was &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee &s;uch a Number of People, but all <HI>Deal</HI> &s;eems to be in a holy Flame, and, was I prepared for it, I &s;hould &s;ee &s;till greater Things than the&s;e.</P>
<P>Dined at Mr. <HI>R</HI>'s, a Grocer in <HI>Deal,</HI> with my Friends; we were mo&s;t ho&s;pitably entertained, and
<PB N="34" REF="004631_0018_100DB1E43B47DF70">
what was far better, had an excellent Opportunity given me of di&s;cour&s;ing for a con&s;iderable Time on our Fall in <HI>Adam,</HI> and the Nece&s;&s;ity of our New Birth in JESUS CHRIST.</P>
<P>Expounded to two Companies again at Night the Epi&s;tle for the Morning, and the two Le&s;&s;ons for the Evening, as mo&s;t &s;uitable for the Day, and was enabled to do it with Power: More People came to Night than before, &s;o that they now did actually put a Prop under the Floor of the Room. Was agree|ably entertained with more Letters, and tho' the Duty of the Day had a little fatigued me, yet GOD &s;trengthened me to &s;it up till Three in the Morning, an&s;wering my Chri&s;tian Corre&s;pondents. <HI>They that wait upon the LORD &s;hall renew their Strength.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thur&s;day, Jan.</HI> 26. I had a Vi&s;it paid me by an Anabapti&s;t Teacher, who came to di&s;cour&s;e with me about the Things that belonged to the Kingdom of GOD. By what I could find he was a &s;piritual Man. I a&s;ked him &s;everal Que&s;tions about taking the mini&s;terial Function, without being called as was <HI>Aaron</HI>; but he did not an&s;wer me to my Sati&s;|faction; however, we both agreed in this, That <HI>un|le&s;s a Man be born again, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of GOD.</HI></P>
<P>I was much comforted by the coming of two more Friends from <HI>London,</HI> with whom I took &s;weet Comfort, and could not but fancy my&s;elf once more at <HI>London,</HI> being &s;urrounded with religious Intimates.</P>

<P>In the Afternoon I took my Friends on board, read Prayers and preached to the Soldiers; after this, went on Shore, &s;ung P&s;alms with my Friends, and then expounded to the People, who now encrea&s;ed &s;o much that I was obliged to divide them into three Companies, and GOD enabled me to continue ex|pounding three Hours without any Intermi&s;&s;ion, or the lea&s;t Wearine&s;s. <HI>Thanks be to GOD for his &s;trength|ning Grace!

<P>Received three more Letters, and &s;at up till One in the Morning to an&s;wer &s;ome &s;ent before, and then went to Bed rejoicing and ble&s;&s;ing GOD for the great Things he had done for me. But withal de&s;irous to &s;ay with the Divine <HI>Herbert,</HI></P>

<P><PB N="36" REF="004631_0019_100DB1E6A27C6268">About Twelve I came on board, being unwilling to be ab&s;ent from my proper Charge long together. I was received kindly, vi&s;ited the Sick and catechi&s;ed the Soldiers, &s;ome of whom an&s;wered mo&s;t aptly, for which I di&s;tributed among&s;t all &s;omething I knew would be agreeable. <HI>Oh! that I may catch them by a holy Guile! but that Power belongeth only unto GOD.</HI></P>
<P>About Two came a Clergyman on board, from a neighbouring Village to pay me a Vi&s;it, with whom I &s;pent an Hour or two agreeably, had Prayers on open Deck, and inforced the Duty of keeping holy the <HI>Sabbath Day,</HI> which then came in Cour&s;e to be explained, but was afraid to &s;ing a P&s;alm, Mr. <HI>H.</HI> being at <HI>Deal</HI> with friends. <HI>Where was my Courage then?

<P>At Five returned a&s;hore with the Clergyman, to whom I promi&s;ed &s;ome Books for his Pari&s;hioners. Expounded three Hours to three Companies, as be|fore. Glad Tidings of great Joy &s;ent me by four or five Corre&s;pondents, &s;at up till One in the Morning an&s;wering them, and then went to Bed and had a feel|ing Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my GOD. <HI>And will GOD in very deed, dwell in this Heart of mine?

<P>Spent the Morning mo&s;t agreeably in Conver&s;a|tion, Interce&s;&s;ion for all Friends, and all Mankind&punc; walking on the Sea Shore.</P>
<P>Dined with Mrs. <HI>St. L.</HI> who ho&s;pitably entertain'd us. Went about Three in the Afternoon, intending
<PB N="37" REF="004631_0019_100DB1E6A27C6268">
to go on board, but could not, which gave me a lit|tle Unea&s;ine&s;s, thinking it by no Means right to leave my Flock &s;o long.</P>
<P>At Night I expounded to three Companies more numerous than before. Received Letters, and &s;at up till One in the Morning an&s;wering them, and went to &s;leep in order to fit my&s;elf for the Duties of the following <HI>Sabbath.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sunday, Jan.</HI> 29. Went on board early in the Morning, read Prayers, and preached to the Soldiers, and vi&s;ited the Sick; then return'd on Shore, and, accompanied with a Troop of pious Friends, ha&s;ted to <HI>Shroulden</HI> Church, about a Mile and half di&s;tant from <HI>Deal.</HI> Where I preach'd to a weeping throng'd Congregation, at the Reque&s;t of the Mini&s;ter, who at my Reque&s;t, gave me and my Friends the Ble&s;|&s;ed Sacrament. Others &s;taid al&s;o, to the Number of &s;ixteen: And (which I never ob&s;erved before) the Clerk pronounced a loud <HI>Amen</HI> to every Per&s;on that received either Bread or Wine: An excellent Cu&s;|tom, and worthy in my Opinion to be imitated in all Churches.</P>
<P>After this, I and my Friends went on our Way rejoicing, and dined comfortably at Mr. <HI>R</HI>'s, and in the Afternoon preach'd at <HI>Upper-Deal.</HI> The Church was quite crowded, and many went away for Want of Room; &s;ome &s;tood on the Leads of the Church on the out&s;ide, and looked in at the Top Windows, and all &s;eem'd eager to hear the Word of GOD. I preach'd again&s;t Worldly-Mindedne&s;s, and had great

Rea&s;on to think GOD gave it his Ble&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>The Weather was exceeding plea&s;ant, and &s;eeing the People go in &s;uch Flocks over the Fields, put me in mind of our Ble&s;&s;ed LORD's Words, when he &s;aw the People coming in Companies from <HI>Samaria: The Fields are white already to Harve&s;t.</HI> I then pray'd, that he would be plea&s;ed to enable me to <HI>gather Wheat into his heavenly Garner.</HI></P>
<P>In the Evening, &s;uch Numbers came to hear me, that I was oblig'd to divide them into four Compa|nies; and GOD enabled me to expound to them from Six till Ten. Some would have per&s;uaded me to have di&s;mi&s;s'd the la&s;t Company without Expound|ing, but I could not bear to let &s;o many go empty away. And I find the more we do for GOD, the more we may. My Strength held out &s;urpri&s;ingly; I was but little if at all fatigued; or if I had, I &s;hould have been &s;ufficiently recompen&s;ed by &s;ome Letters, which I received from my dear Friends, which gave me un&s;peakable Satisfaction: And after I had peru&s;ed them, I took a little Refre&s;hment, rejoiced and gave Thanks with my Friends for the Ble&s;&s;ings of the Day, and went to our re&s;pective Beds about Twelve at Night. <HI>Oh! Who can expre&s;s the Loving Kindne&s;s of the LORD, or &s;hew forth all his Prai&s;e?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Monday, Jan.</HI> 30. At the Reque&s;t of the Inhabi|tants, and the Leave of Mr. <HI>R.</HI> (who &s;ent from <HI>Can|terbury</HI> a mo&s;t obliging Me&s;&s;age) I preached again at <HI>Upper-Deal</HI> to as crouded and attentive Audience as I had Ye&s;terday; and afterwards I and Mr. <HI>H.</HI>

<P>Soon after this we went to Mr. <HI>R</HI>'s, where our Friends expected us: But we had not been long there, before the Wind &s;hifted about on a &s;udden, and a Cry came, <HI>The Wind is fair, prepare your&s;elves for Sailing.</HI> I received the News with an humble Joy. But Sorrow, I perceived, filled the Hearts of my dear Friends, who came from <HI>London</HI> to &s;ee me. We immediately retired, intending to intercede for all Mankind before we parted: But the People were in &s;uch a Hurry, for fear the Sea &s;hould grow too tempe&s;tuous to go off, that we were obliged to be very brief. Having therefore recommended our&s;elves

to GOD, I took my Leave. But Oh, what Affecti|on did the <HI>Deal</HI> People expre&s;s to my unworthy Per&s;on! for no &s;ooner were they apprized of the Wind being fair, but they came running in Droves after me to the Sea-Shore, wi&s;hing me good Luck in the Name of the LORD; and with Tears, and other Expre&s;&s;ions of Kindne&s;s, praying for my Suc|ce&s;s and &s;afe Return.

<P>The Sea was very boi&s;terous indeed, and the Waves ro&s;e Mountains high: But GOD was plea&s;ed to give Mr. <HI>H.</HI> and me an unu&s;ual Degree of Faith, and we went on &s;inging P&s;alms and prai&s;ing GOD, the Water da&s;hing in our Faces all the Way.

<P>About Five we came on board, and were receiv'd with Joy: For the Ship was under Sail, and the People were afraid I &s;hould be left behind. As I was going into the great Cabbin, I fell down the Steerage Stairs; but received little or no Hurt. Af|ter we had &s;ailed for a &s;hort Time, the Man of War not moving, we ca&s;t Anchor again.

<P><HI>Tue&s;day, Jan.</HI> 31. Spent the Morning in writing Letters, vi&s;iting the Sick, reading Prayers and preach|ing to the Soldiers.</P>
<P>About Twelve was plea&s;ingly &s;urpri&s;ed with ano|ther Sight of my <HI>London</HI> Friends, who &s;tayed at <HI>Deal</HI>

all Night, and finding the Ship did not &s;ail, came with &s;ome more <HI>Deal</HI> Friends to take me on Shore, that I might bid them once more farewel. I was a little unwilling at fir&s;t, but by their Importunity and affectionate Intreaties they even compelled me. I accordingly went with them, &s;inging P&s;alms and prai&s;ing GOD all the Way.</P>
<P>But I had &s;carce been on Shore an Hour before the Man of War gave a Signal for &s;ailing; and &s;o we were obliged to ha&s;ten back on board. The People expre&s;&s;ed much Joy at &s;eeing me come to <HI>Deal</HI> again, and accompanied me to the Sea Shore, as before.</P>
<P>The Weather being fair, we went on board with Plea&s;ure: The Ship was under Sail, but we met with it, and were received affectionately. <HI>I hope that the&s;e frequent and &s;udden Removes will put me in mind that I have here no continuing City; and &s;tir me up to live &s;o holily, that was GOD at any time to &s;ay, This Night &s;hall thy Soul be required of thee; I might with Plea|&s;ure &s;ay, Lo I come!</HI></P>

Joined in Spirit with ab&s;ent Friends in holy Ordinances; &s;pent &s;ome Time mo&s;t delightfully in reading the Word of GOD: Read Prayers, and &s;ome Ob&s;ervations on both the Le&s;&s;ons in the Great Cabbin; and then read Prayers and ex|pounded both the Le&s;&s;ons to the Soldiers. <HI>O that the LORD would open our Under&s;tandings! for they are but a dead Letter without the Illumination of his Holy Spirit!</HI></P>
<P>Read Prayers and preached my Sermon on <HI>Ju&s;ti|fication</HI> in the Afternoon to the Officers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in the Great Cabbin.</P>
<P>Begun to-night to turn the Ob&s;ervations made on

the Le&s;&s;ons in the Morning into catechi&s;tical Que&s;|tions, and was plea&s;ed to hear &s;ome of the Soldiers and my Companions make &s;uch apt An&s;wers. I find this an excellent Way of In&s;truction: It makes them bring their Bible, and give diligent Heed to the Things that are &s;poken: It teaches them the Scriptures practically, and con&s;equently will by the Divine Ble&s;&s;ing make them wi&s;e unto Salvation. <HI>Thanks be to GOD for putting this into my Heart! By his A&s;&s;i&s;tance I intend to continue it.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Monday, Feb.</HI> 6. Had no Prayers in the Morn|ing between Decks; but read Prayers in the Cab|bin, likewi&s;e did the &s;ame in the Evening, and expounded the 14th Chapter of St. <HI>Matthew,</HI> the &s;econd Le&s;&s;on, which containing an Account of St. <HI>John</HI>'s reproving <HI>Herod,</HI> gave me an Opportunity of telling them, that great Men &s;hould not be angry if Mini&s;ters &s;hould reprove them out of Love; and they &s;eemed to a&s;&s;ent to it.</P>
<P>Read Prayers and preached to the Soldiers as u&s;ual; interceded warmly for ab&s;ent Friends and all Mankind; and went to Bed full of Peace and Joy. <HI>Thanks be to GOD for this un&s;peakable Gift</HI>!</P>
<P>Was plea&s;ed to &s;ee Mr. <HI>H.</HI> &s;o active in teaching the Children. He has now many Scholars: <HI>May GOD pro&s;per the Works of his Hands upon him</HI>!</P>
<P>Had &s;uch plea&s;ant Sailing, that Captain <HI>W.</HI> &s;aid he never knew the like before. <HI>What Rea&s;on have I to be thankful</HI>! <HI>O that my Friends would help me to give Thanks.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="004631_0024_100D85FB4019D160"><HI>Tue&s;day, Feb.</HI> 7. Read Prayers and expounded the Le&s;&s;ons as u&s;ual to the Soldiers, and in the great Cabbin; and after Dinner &s;ung P&s;alms with Mr. <HI>H.</HI> and a Gentleman on board, on open Deck.</P>
<P>Being now in the Bay of <HI>Bi&s;cay,</HI> the Ship rock'd very much, tho' there was a great Calm: <HI>But if there's a fixed Principle of Grace, a firm Love of GOD rooted in the Heart; what avails all outward Motions?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Wedne&s;day, Feb.</HI> 8. Had publick Wor&s;hip and expounded as u&s;ual to both my Congregations. Was plea&s;ed to hear a Gentleman di&s;cour&s;e for &s;ome Time of the utter Inability of any Thing to make us hap|py but GOD.</P>
<P>In the Afternoon I preached and read Prayers on open Deck, at the Captain's De&s;ire, who ordered Chairs to be brought, and Boards put acro&s;s them for the Soldiers to &s;it upon. My Subject was, <HI>the Eternity of Hell Torments</HI>; and I was earne&s;t in de|livering of it, being de&s;irous that none of my dear Hearers &s;hould experience them. Praying and &s;ing|ing P&s;alms on open Deck enlarged my Heart.</P>
<P>Was enabled to make good Part of a Sermon this Evening, and lay down to Sleep. <HI>GOD grant I may die daily!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thur&s;day, Feb.</HI> 9. Read Prayers, expounded and catechi&s;ed as u&s;ual; had delightful Sailing, and great Joy in the HOLY GHOST, and was very thankful that GOD called me abroad to &s;ee and admire his Wonders in the Deep. <HI>O who can &s;erve a better Ma&s;ter than JESUS CHRIST?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="004631_0025_100DB1F52DC7D558"><HI>Friday, Feb.</HI> 10. Read Prayers, and according to Cu&s;tom went on in explaining the Catechi&s;m to the Women; and after Evening Prayer expounded the 49th P&s;alm in&s;tead of the Le&s;&s;on. Had &s;till grea|ter Rea&s;on to ble&s;s GOD for bringing me to Sea. <HI>O what &s;hall I render unto the LORD?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Saturday, Feb.</HI> 11. Catechi&s;ed, vi&s;ited the Sick, expounded and read Prayers as u&s;ual; and met with &s;ome Soldiers who could &s;ing by Note, with whom I propo&s;e to join in Divine P&s;almody every Day.</P>
<LG>
<L>A P&s;alm may win him who a Sermon flies,</L>
<L>And turn Delight into a Sacrifice.</L>
</LG>
<P>In the Evening gave Thanks for the Ble&s;&s;ings, and examined into the Actions of the pa&s;t Week. <HI>It's well I have a Saviour to &s;atisfy for my Perfor|mances as well as my Per&s;on, for otherwi&s;e how &s;hould I &s;tand before thee, O Holy LORD GOD? GOD be merciful to me a Sinner.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sunday, Feb.</HI> 12. Did as u&s;ual, and preached my Sermon on Glorification to the Gentlemen in the great Cabbin. <HI>Oh that GOD may make us Parta|kers of it.</HI></P>
<P>Hone&s;t <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> my Servant returned Thanks after Morning Prayers for his Recovery from a late &s;e|vere Fit of Sickne&s;s. I hope now CHRIST has touched him, by the Right Hand of his healing Power, he will ari&s;e and mini&s;ter unto him. He tells me he can &s;ay with <HI>David, It is good for me that I have been afflicted. GOD be prai&s;ed! for &s;anctified Afflictions are Signs of &s;pecial Love.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="004631_0025_100DB1F52DC7D558"><HI>Monday, Feb.</HI> 13. Did as u&s;ual, only in&s;tead of the &s;econd Le&s;&s;on, expounded the 22d Chapter of St. <HI>Matthew,</HI> at the Captain's Reque&s;t, who takes all Opportunities to expre&s;s his Kindne&s;s to me: <HI>May the GOD whom I &s;erve, &s;anctify and &s;ave him.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Tue&s;day Feb.</HI> 14. May I never forget this Day's Mercies, &s;ince the LORD was plea&s;ed to deal &s;o lo|vingly with me! About. Twelve at Night a fre&s;h Gale aro&s;e, which increa&s;ed &s;o very much by Four in the Morning, that the Waves raged horribly in|deed, and broke in like a River on many of the poor Soldiers who lay near the Main Hatch Way. Friend <HI>H.</HI> and I knew nothing of it, but perceived our&s;elves re&s;tle&s;s, and could not &s;leep at all; he complained of a grievous Head-ach. I aro&s;e and called upon GOD for my&s;elf and tho&s;e that &s;ailed with me, ab&s;ent Friends, and all Mankind. After this I went on Deck; but &s;urely a more noble aw|ful Sight my Eyes never yet beheld! for the Waves ro&s;e more than Mountains high; and &s;ometimes came on the Quarter-Deck. I endeavoured all the while to magnify GOD, for thus making his Power to be known: And then creeping on my Knees (for I knew not how to go otherwi&s;e) I followed my Friend <HI>H.</HI> between Decks, and &s;ung P&s;alms and comforted the poor wet People. After this, I read Prayers in the great Cabbin; but we were obliged to &s;it all the while. Then thinking I &s;hould be ca|pable of doing nothing, I laid my&s;elf acro&s;s the Chair reading; but GOD was &s;o good, &s;o to a&s;&s;i&s;t
<PB N="50" REF="004631_0026_100DB1F7500F7340">
me by his Spirit, that tho' Things were tumbling, the Ship rocking, and Per&s;ons falling down unable to &s;tand, and &s;ick about me; yet I never was more chearful in my Life, and was enabled, though in the mid&s;t of Company, to fini&s;h a Sermon before I went to Bed, which I had begun a few Days before: So greatly was GOD's Strength magnified in my Weak|ne&s;s! <HI>Prai&s;e the LORD, O my Soul, and all that is within me prai&s;e his holy. Name!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thur&s;day, Feb.</HI> 16. Did as u&s;ual in the Ship; only in&s;tead of Catechi&s;ing, examined into the Pro|ficiency of my Friend <HI>H</HI>'s Scholars; gave them proper Encouragement, as I &s;aw they wanted; and had Hopes &s;ome of them would become living Mem|bers of JESUS CHRIST.</P>
<P>Joined with tho&s;e at Night, who &s;et apart this Day as a Day of Fa&s;ting and Humiliation, to de|precate the Judgments our National Sins de&s;erve. <HI>LORD, hear our Prayers, and let our Cry come unto thee.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Friday, Feb.</HI> 17. Read Prayers, expounded the Le&s;&s;ons and proceeded on my Explanation of the Catechi&s;m to the Women: Expounded part of the <HI>Lord's Prayer,</HI> after Evening Prayer, in the Great Cabbin; and intend, after this is done, to go on with <HI>Creed</HI> and <HI>Ten Commandments. GOD give us all praying, believing, obedient Hearts.</HI></P>
<P>Found hone&s;t Mr. <HI>D.</HI> particularly u&s;eful to me, I being a little &s;ick by the late &s;haking of the Ship, and the Heat and Smell of the People between

Decks, who, as yet, have &s;carce Had Time to reco|ver them&s;elves &s;ince the Storm. <HI>O how &s;oon are the&s;e frail Tabernacles of ours put out of Order! Hap|py the Man who &s;erves GOD in his Health, and has nothing to do when Sickne&s;s &s;eizes him but quietly to lye down and die.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Saturday, Feb.</HI> 18. Performed the u&s;ual Duty, and fini&s;hed the <HI>Lord's Prayer.</HI> Perceived my bo|dily Di&s;orders to go off, and was enabled to preach to the Soldiers with more Enlargement than I have been for the&s;e four Days pa&s;t. The Captain ob&s;er|ved me a little di&s;ordered, and gave Mr. <HI>H.</HI> a Cor|dial for me: The good LORD note this Favour in his Book.</P>
<P>After Dinner I grew better and better; was ex|ceedingly delighted by &s;itting on Deck, prai&s;ing GOD for the Plea&s;antne&s;s of the Weather, and read|ing Archbi&s;hop <HI>Cranmer</HI>'s Life: <HI>Surely he was a righteous Man.</HI> The Account of his Fall made my Heart tremble within me. <HI>But why &s;houlde&s;t thou be ca&s;t down, O my Soul? Still tru&s;t in GOD: He that has begun will carry on and fini&s;h the good Work. Even &s;o,</HI> LORD JESUS, <HI>come quickly.</HI></P>
<P>Though the Weather was exceeding plea&s;ant all the Day, yet it grew more and more plea&s;ant in the Evening, and our Ship &s;ailed at the Rate of nine Miles an Hour, and as &s;teady as tho' we were &s;itting on Shore. The Night, was exceeding clear, and the Moon and Stars appeared in their greate&s;t Lu&s;tre; &s;o that not having Patience to &s;tay below, I went
<PB N="52" REF="004631_0027_100DB1F96171AD10">
upon Deck with Friend <HI>H.</HI> and prai&s;ed GOD for his wonderful loving Kindne&s;s in &s;inging P&s;alms, and gave Thanks for the Ble&s;&s;ings, and a&s;ked Par|don for the Offences of the Week, and then had a long Interce&s;&s;ion. <HI>GOD grant I may learn a Le&s;&s;on from this good Providence of GOD, and the nearer I come to my Journey's End, the quicker may my Pace be.</HI></P>
<P>It is worth coming from <HI>England;</HI> to &s;ee what we have beheld this Day. <HI>GOD be prai&s;ed for all his Mercies.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sunday, Feb.</HI> 19. Slept better to Night than I have a long while; <HI>ble&s;&s;ed be the Keeper of</HI> I&s;rael. Read Prayers in the great Cabbin; was enlarged in expounding both the Le&s;&s;ons to the Soldiers; and had Prayers, and preached one of the Sermons GOD enabled me to make &s;ince I came on board, on open Deck in the Afternoon, All the Gentlemen at|tended, Benches were laid for the People, and the Ship &s;ailed &s;moothly, and the Weather was finer than I can expre&s;s; &s;o that I know not where I have perform'd the Service more comfortably. And indeed, I have been &s;o delighted the&s;e two Days with our plea&s;ant &s;ailing, and the Promontaries all around us, that I could not avoid thanking GOD for calling me abroad, and &s;tirring up all to prai&s;e him: <HI>Who by his Strength &s;etteth fa&s;t the Mountains, and is girded about with Power.</HI></P>
<P>For the&s;e two Days our Ship has &s;ailed at the Rate of a Hundred and &s;ixty Miles in twenty-four
<PB N="53" REF="004631_0027_100DB1F96171AD10">
Hours, and rode in Triumph directly before the Wind, and ca&s;t Anchor about Two in the Morn|ing; 'till which Time, I &s;at up on purpo&s;e to give Thanks in <HI>Gibraltar</HI> Haven. <HI>Oh that my Friends would therefore prai&s;e the LORD for his Goodne&s;s, and extol him for the wonderful Works he hath done for me, the lea&s;t of the Sons of Men.</HI></P>
<P>How Providence will be plea&s;ed to di&s;po&s;e of me here, I cannot yet know; but I thought proper to &s;end you this Account of my &s;hort Voyage al|ready, to &s;hew you how GOD has heard your Pray|ers, to provoke you to Thankfulne&s;s, and to encou|rage you to per&s;evere in praying on my Behalf. If you ob&s;erve (as doubtle&s;s you may) any thing ami&s;s or imprudent in my Conduct, I be&s;eech you, by the Mercies of GOD in CHRIST JESUS, tell me plain|ly: for that Cau&s;e have I been &s;o particular: And if you &s;hould happen to &s;ee any Thing com|mendable or prai&s;e-worthy in my Behaviour, Oh, do not think more highly of me than you ought to think; for I am a Worm, and no Man, and de&s;erve to be the Out-ca&s;t of the People: but <HI>give all Glory to my be&s;t Ma&s;ter, by who&s;e free Grace I am what I am.</HI></P>
