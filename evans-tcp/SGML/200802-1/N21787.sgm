<P>THE IMPORTANCE OF THE RISING GENERATION. A SERMON, PREACHED At the De&s;ire of the SELECTMEN, and the COMMITTEE for in&s;pecting the Town Schools: OCCASIONED BY THE DEDICATION Of a new and very commodious GRAMMAR SCHOOL HOUSE, lately erected in the First Pari&s;h of the Town of GLOUCESTER, ON THE 5th OF MARCH, 1795, BY ELI FORBES, A.

<BIBL>PSALM xlv. 16.</BIBL>
<Q>INSTEAD OF THY FATHERS SHALL BE THY CHILDREN, WHOM THOU MAYEST MAKE PRINCES IN ALL THE EARTH.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THIS p&s;alm is an illu&s;tration of many other prophe|cies which relate to the Me&s;&s;iah, the Prince, and points him out more expre&s;&s;ly than any other chapter or p&s;alm in the Old Te&s;tament. It &s;peaks of the royalty and ex|cellency of his per&s;on; the exten&s;ivene&s;s of his victories; the righteou&s;ne&s;s of his government, of which there would be no end: for his kingdom is an everla&s;ting kingdom, and his dominion ruleth over all.</P>
<P>And, that though in this world his &s;ubjects would be continually moving off the &s;tage, increa&s;ing the number of the dead; yet, that they would be &s;ucceeded by ri&s;ing generations, who &s;hould come in their room; who, by making greater improvements in knowledge and virtue, under better advantages for light, truth and grace, may ri&s;e to honour in the pre&s;ent, and arrive to the dignity of kings, and the &s;anctity of prie&s;ts, in the future world; &s;o, in the &s;en&s;e of our text, be made princes in all the earth. So, we may con&s;ider our text as a prophecy, containing a promi&s;e which a&s;certains the increa&s;ing glory of the king|dom of the Redeemer among men; for it implies, that, by improving clearer light and richer privileges of grace, and the ble&s;&s;ings of the go&s;pel, the &s;ucceeding generations of men may arive to greater purity of morals, and dignity of character, and be made princes in all the earth.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="028687_0004_0FDA526F8C85AC58">
Our text al&s;o implies, that there will be a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of men, who &s;hall re&s;tore the wa&s;tes of mortality; that the earth &s;hall not want inhabitants: but the various depar|tments, both in civil and &s;ocial life, &s;hall be filled with hon|our and fidelity; and not only &s;o, but that there &s;hall be a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of good men; for both the prophecy and pro|mi&s;e of our text re&s;pect the future happy reign of the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah,</HI> when he &s;hall have, as the reward of his &s;ufferings, a &s;eed to &s;erve him, who &s;hall be accounted unto the Lord for a generation of the righteous; and opens to the eye of faith, an exten&s;ive &s;pread of religion to unborn nations; when the &s;ublime maxims of piety and morality &s;hall be generally received, and operate as univer&s;al principles of true virtue, which &s;hall rai&s;e the dignity of human nature; that, in however high or low offices they may be called to act, they will fill their &s;tations with honour; that, in the language of our text, they may be princes in all the earth; that it may be &s;aid of all the earth, as it was of Tyre, "Her merchants &s;hall be princes and her traffickers or me|chanicks &s;hall be the honourable of the earth, <HI>I&s;aiah</HI> xxiii. 8.</P>
<P>When we reflect upon the time, the manner and the views, with which our pious ance&s;tors left the land of their nativity, and &s;ought a retreat from the iron hand of tyran|ny and oppre&s;&s;ion in the&s;e wilds of America, which, from time immemorial, had been over&s;pread with moral dark|ne&s;s, heathen barbarity, and Indian idolatry; and as they brought the go&s;pel and the means of knowledge with them, and were influenced by its &s;acred maxims, the knowledge of God and Je&s;us Chri&s;t was &s;oon &s;pread&mdash;the wor&s;hip of God e&s;tabli&s;hed&mdash;&s;chools were erected&mdash;&s;emi|naries planted&mdash;colleges founded by them; but as they were not allowed to "continue by rea&s;on of death," in the room of the&s;e pious fathers were their children, who piou&s;|ly maintained the&s;e in&s;titutions: being nur&s;ed in tho&s;e &s;eminar<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters"> they became "plants of renown," who being tran&s;planted into the church and &s;tate, where they &s;hone with honor; &s;ome in the higher and more public offices of life; and others, being in&s;tructed in the lower and more common branches of literature, have been bred to agricul|ture

navigation, and the mechanical arts, and moving in a humbler yet not le&s;s u&s;eful &s;phere; but whenever either the higher or the lower departments have been uniformly influenced, directed and re&s;trained by the nobler principles of true virtue, they have appeared princely in all the earth: &s;o that at the di&s;tance of more than two thou&s;and years from the publication of this prophecy and promi&s;e, we have &s;een them fulfilling, down to the pre&s;ent day; &s;o that we are living witne&s;&s;es of their truth and importance; for we are in the room of our fathers, and here we &s;ee our children forming, and by the various grades of education ri&s;ing into re&s;pectability, and will &s;oon take our places, and we mu&s;t leave them our room, and de&s;cend to the bed of du&s;t&mdash;"when our &s;ons may ri&s;e to honour, and we &s;hall know it not; or they may be brought low, and we &s;hall not perceive it of them." But if we are not wanting to our&s;elves, to our children, or to &s;ociety, we may hope that this &s;cripture will be more completely fulfilled, and the kingdom of the Redeemer will &s;oon have a more exten&s;ive &s;pread than it ever yet has had; and that in the room of the fathers there will be children, who may &s;ucce&s;&s;ively ari&s;e and declare his righteou&s;ne&s;s unto tho&s;e who may be born of them.</P>
<P>But prophecies and promi&s;es do not prevent or &s;uper&s;ede human endeavours; but they are de&s;igned to encourage duty, to &s;timulate noble exertions, and &s;upport and brighten future hopes. Therefore, animated by the pro|phecy and promi&s;e, that God will have a &s;eed to &s;erve him, and that in the room of the fathers &s;hall be the children, who, by the improvement of clearer light and more di&s;tin|gui&s;hed priveleges, may appear in their &s;everal &s;tations to advantage, <HI>princes in all the earth,</HI> let us do what we can to promote the education of our children. Particular at|tention &s;hould be paid to youth, the ri&s;ing generation, that they be well in&s;tructed, religiou&s;ly educated, and &s;tea|dily and wi&s;ely governed. The education of children was always the fir&s;t thing our pious forefathers attended to; after they had got a &s;ettlement in this land, they, like Abram, fir&s;t built an altar, fixed on a place for public
<PB N="6" REF="028687_0006_0FDA5276434C7B80">
wor&s;hip, and then erected &s;chools for the education of their children.</P>
<P>So long ago as in 1633, the fir&s;t &s;ettlers of this town con&s;ecrated a hou&s;e for public wor&s;hip, and &s;oon after made provi&s;ion for a &s;chool, as being in their view of importance to &s;ociety, next to that of wor&s;hipping God in a public and &s;ocial manner, placing the duty we owe to our chil|dren next to that we owe to our God: therefore, when new town&s;hips were laid out or incorporated, care was taken that lands were &s;eque&s;trated fir&s;t for the encouragement and benefit of the go&s;pel mini&s;try, and then &s;chool lots for the benefit and &s;upport of free &s;chools:&mdash;&s;o al&s;o particular care was taken that all in&s;tructors of &s;chools were men of capacity, piety, and good morals. Thus it is evident that the idea that our forefathers had of a &s;chool education, was that it &s;hould be <HI>religious.</HI></P>
<P>And indeed without the heart is well e&s;tabli&s;hed on the principles of religion, the mo&s;t enlightened head will be of little u&s;e to &s;ociety, and of le&s;s advantage to the per&s;ons them&s;elves; they will not be princes in the earth, will not fill the &s;tations they are called to occupy with honour;&mdash;men of learning, without the balance of virtuous principles, will be likely to prove pe&s;ts to &s;ociety, and accumulate to them&s;elves infamy and ruin. Suffer me then, on this oc|ca&s;ion, to recommend it to all who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s it is, or may be, to provide in&s;tructors and governors of &s;chools, that they employ none but tho&s;e who are equal to the tru&s;t, and of &s;ober lives and conver&s;ation; men of principle, and who in the judgment of charity are good men. And I would recommend to all ma&s;ters and in&s;tructors of &s;chools, that they pay particular attention to the morals of the &s;chools, over which they pre&s;ide; that they inform the under&s;tand|ing and impre&s;s the heart; for though without know|ledge the heart cannot be good, yet the mo&s;t exten&s;ive knowledge, without the regulating principles of religion, will not make the heart better, nor reform the life. It is of the la&s;t importance then, that a religious ca&s;t &s;hould be given to all &s;chool education; and this importance a|ri&s;es out of the nature and rea&s;on of things, and it is &s;ug|ge&s;ted
<PB N="7" REF="028687_0007_0FD9BBD4A8CC6988">
to us from the words of our text; for the children are to come in the room of their fathers, and to act a no|ble part&mdash;<HI>princes in all the earth;</HI> adopt a line of conduct in whatever department they &s;hall be called to act in, that may be an honour to them&s;elves, &s;upport the dignity of the human character, be, and appear to be, the &s;ons of God, the di&s;ciples of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and friends to all man|kind; and &s;o, in the &s;en&s;e of our text, be made princes in all the earth.</P>
<P>Give me leave to add&mdash;it is of importance that youth be religiou&s;ly in&s;tructed; for it is through them that reli|gion and good morals are to be tran&s;mitted to po&s;terity: they are our hopes, and we expect to live in them. Now to &s;upport the&s;e plea&s;ing hopes, it is nece&s;&s;ary that they &s;hould come upon the &s;tage with their minds well informed in all the various branches of u&s;eful knowledge, and their hearts well e&s;tabli&s;hed by the operation of the principles of true virtue.</P>
<P>We all love to have our children wi&s;e and good. Tho&s;e who are vicious them&s;elves, love to have their children ap|pear in the world under every advantage, and to act an ho|nourable part in the &s;phere where Providence &s;hall place them, and ever approve them&s;elves wi&s;e, virtuous and good; good members of the &s;ociety to which they may belong.</P>
<P>And I do not think that any one of us can reli&s;h the thought with plea&s;ure, that religion, good order and liber|ty, both civil and religious, &s;hall die in the hands of our children; that the cau&s;e for which our ance&s;tors left their native country, and for which our late fathers and breth|ren have fought, bled and died, &s;hould be lo&s;t in the hands of the next generation: and without they are well in&s;truct|ed, well governed, their heads well furni&s;hed with u&s;eful knowledge, and their hearts under the regulating princi|ples of piety and morality, we &s;hall have no &s;ecurity of the cau&s;e in their hands. No one can well conceive how much, under God, depends upon the character of our children, both with re&s;pect to them&s;elves and to &s;ociety at large: and we can &s;carcely realize the refined plea&s;ure it
<PB N="8" REF="028687_0008_0FDA527C2B47B640">
mu&s;t afford a tender and well di&s;po&s;ed parent, when they can look forward, and on good grounds hope, that their children will ri&s;e up and take their places and fill them with honour, and, in the &s;tyle of our text, be made princes in all the earth. With &s;uch a pro&s;pect the parental heart leaps for joy, for they have no "greater joy than that of &s;eeing their children walk in the truth." When they &s;ee them formed to this amiable temper, to this honourable and u&s;eful character, they can leave the world in peace; or like that pious father of old, who called his children round about his dying pillow, and &s;aid, behold I die; but God &s;hall be with you, and make you princes in all the earth, ornaments to &s;ociety, an honour to them&s;elves, and the glory of future generations.</P>
<P>I think we may, in the faithful di&s;charge of the duties incumbent upon us to the pre&s;ent generation, &s;afely con|fide in the prophecy and promi&s;e of God, that in our room &s;hall be our children, who, by a better improvement of the privileges and advantages they do, or they may enjoy, in this day of &s;cience and land of liberty, may, under the transforming hand of knowledge and grace, be made, in the &s;en&s;e of our text, princes in all the earth.</P>

<P>You have done well in the attention you have paid to, and the provi&s;ion you have made for, the education of your children; and, agreeable to the votes of the re&s;pective bodies you repre&s;ent, have erected hou&s;es &s;o re&s;pectable

It was at the de&s;ire of the tru&s;tees of the Proprietors' School, that we opened their hou&s;e with a dedicatory prayer and a &s;hort addre&s;s to the &s;chool.</P>

<P>You are engaged in an arduous and important work. It is not without its honours and its plea&s;ures; it is plea&s;|ing "to bend the twig, and to teach the &s;hoot how to grow;" it is the highe&s;t honour to be the mo&s;t exten&s;ively u&s;eful.</P>

<P>If you are faithful, how far the happy influence of your in&s;tructions may extend, no one can tell. There is at lea&s;t a high probability, that you will &s;ucceed: for there is a divine proverb which implies a divine promi&s;e, "Train up a child in the way that he &s;hould go, and when he is old he &s;hall not depart from it."</P>
<P>It is evident that the propagation of religion, virtue and good order will depend, under God, very much upon the influence which your in&s;tructions will have upon the minds of youth, who are, or may be, under your care. It will in general form their future conduct, and give a ca&s;t to their whole deportment through life, wherever they may be &s;pread through all the earth:&mdash;not only &s;o, but they will carry your principles of conduct into &s;ocial and dome&s;|tic

That your reward may be great, and your hone&s;t, prudent and faithful labours may be crowned with &s;ucce&s;s, &s;uffer me, in the la&s;t place, to recommend it to you, that you pray with and for your &s;chools; not only becau&s;e all &s;ucce&s;s depends upon the ble&s;&s;ing of God, which is to be drawn down by &s;erious, frequent and fer|vent prayer, e&s;pecially where we have to do with the heart, but al&s;o becau&s;e prayer is one very important and e&s;&s;ential branch of religious education, and which, therefore, never &s;hould be omitted, either in families, where there are children and &s;ervants, or in &s;chools, where there mu&s;t be line upon line, and precept upon precept. When your children &s;ee and hear you in a &s;erious and &s;olemn manner addre&s;s their great Creator, as the &s;upreme and moral go|vernor of the world, and the fountain of goodne&s;s, they will learn to form right apprehen&s;ions of his moral and rec|toral character; their dependence upon him, and obliga|tions

to him; and will be taught the fear of the Lord, which is the beginning of wi&s;dom: when they hear you humbly confe&s;s &s;in, and implore pardon, they will feel them&s;elves &s;inners, di&s;cover &s;omething of the nature of &s;in, and the need they &s;tand in of the pardoning mercy of God, and be led to repentance: when they hear you pre&s;ent your petitions, in the name and through the atonement and interce&s;&s;ion of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, they will in&s;en&s;ibly be taught to form &s;ome correct apprehen&s;ions of this media|torial character, which lies in the foundation of the chri&s;tian faith: when they hear you offer up interce&s;&s;ions for others, e&s;pecially for the afflicted, their &s;u&s;ceptible hearts will naturally glow with benevolence to all mankind, and with compa&s;&s;ion and &s;ympathy for the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, which is a leading trait of that wi&s;dom which is from above; which is fir&s;t pure and then peaceable&mdash;full of love and good fruits: &s;o when they hear them&s;elves, particularly mentioned (as they always &s;hould be) they will e&s;teem and love you, and this will give weight to your in&s;truc|tions, render your paternal government ea&s;y, and it will open the young mind to imbibe the &s;entiments you incul|cate, and follow the example you &s;et them; and if the&s;e are in conformity to him who is the Apo&s;tle and High Prie&s;t of our profe&s;&s;ion, they will appear princely in all the earth.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear Children and young Friends,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>Mo&s;t of you have been publicly dedicated to God, and the&s;e hands of mine have admini&s;tered the &s;acred rite to you. I feel tenderly intere&s;ted in your happine&s;s, as I have, I tru&s;t, &s;incerely con&s;ecrated you to God under the form of his initiating ordinance, under which your parents al&s;o engaged to bring you up for him. In the di&s;charge of tho&s;e engagements they have erected hou&s;es with every ac|commodation, and have placed you under in&s;tructors who
<PB N="14" REF="028687_0014_0FDA528CBA0086A8">
may form you to knowledge and virtue, and make you princes in all the earth. You have now a price put into your hands, to get wi&s;dom; therefore get wi&s;dom, and with all thy getting get under&s;tanding. If you do not im|prove the advantage you now enjoy, you will offend God, injure your parents, and wrong your own &s;ouls. You have heard that you are our hopes&mdash;that you are ri&s;ing up in our &s;tead; for we are moving off the &s;tage, and mu&s;t &s;oon make our bed in the du&s;t; for behold we die, but God will be with you if ye be with him; but if you for&s;ake him, he will for&s;ake you. You mu&s;t fear God, love and &s;erve him, and cry unto God, and &s;ay, "My Father thou art the guide of my youth." He has &s;aid, "I love tho&s;e who love me, and they who &s;eek me early &s;hall find me." Seek the Lord then while he may be found, and call upon him while he is near. You mu&s;t love too the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who fir&s;t loved us, and died for us, and ro&s;e again from the dead, and is gone to heaven, and ever lives, praying for us. And will you not love him in return for the great love wherewith he has loved us? And will you not accept of him for your Saviour, tru&s;t in him that you may be &s;aved by him? He was once here on the earth; and though he was the Son of God, the brightne&s;s of his Father's glory, and had all power both in heaven and in earth, yet he conde&s;cended to take particular notice of youth, of little children, and kindly took them into his arms, and ble&s;&s;ed them, and &s;aid, "<HI>Of &s;uch is the kingdom of heaven.</HI>" Come then to him, and lodge the &s;alvation of your &s;ouls in his hands. He has &s;aid, Who&s;o|ever will come unto me, I will in no wi&s;e ca&s;t him out. The ble&s;&s;ed Redeemer now &s;tands with open arms to re|ceive you, and to make you the children of God, and the heirs of glory. You mu&s;t a&s;k of God, in the name of Chri&s;t, to give you his holy &s;pirit, to change your hearts, and &s;anctify your natures, and to adorn your &s;ouls with the chri&s;tian graces, that you may &s;hine as lights in this dark world, and be made meet for the inheritance of the &s;aints in light. And God is as ready to give his holy &s;pi|rit to them who a&s;k him, as we your parents are ready to
<PB N="15" REF="028687_0015_0FDA528F05F22BC8">
give you bread, or any thing el&s;e that is good for you. But if you &s;hould forget your God, neglect your Saviour, and mi&s;improve your time, and run heedle&s;s on, with the thoughtle&s;s, vain and vicious youth, in the paths of di&s;&s;i|pation and folly, you will make bitter work for repentance, and wound the hearts of your parents and bring down their grey hairs with &s;orrow to the grave.</P>
<P>But if you &s;hould now improve your time, and the advan|tages you have in your hand, you will ri&s;e into honour; and when you &s;hall enter upon the &s;tage of life, you will appear to advantage, as princes in all the earth, the &s;ons of God, without rebuke. And having &s;erved God and your generation, according to the will of God, you will meet the approbation of your Lord and Ma&s;ter, and re|ceive the rewards of his grace in the kingdom of glory.</P>
