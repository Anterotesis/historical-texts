<P>_THIS pa&s;&s;age of the evangelical hi&s;tory, to a condemned, dying criminal, near, and in the clo&s;ing &s;cene of final execution, contains matter of inexpre&s;&s;ible importance. A mo&s;t amazing in&s;tance of &s;tupidity and wick|edne&s;s, in the one malefactor, acted out amid&s;t his expiring &s;truggles, and the tor|tures of crucifixion; and a mo&s;t &s;urprizing in&s;tance of the &s;udden and &s;aying conver|&s;ion
<PB N="4" REF="032292_0003_0FF1B6D0246DCA58">
of the other, with the wonderful, infinite grace and power of the &s;uffering Saviour, him&s;elf expiring on the cro&s;s&mdash; yet then amid&s;t all the ignominy and an|gui&s;h of it, giving immortal life, and en&s;uring a &s;eat that day with him&s;elf in paradi&s;e, to a guilty, but penitent &s;inner, then crucified and dying with him.&mdash; The&s;e things are exhibited, in a manner, and with circum&s;tances the mo&s;t affect|ing and in&s;tructive.</P>
<P>The enraged Jews, with their rulers at their head, having with unaccount|able malice and zeal &s;ought the death of Je&s;us, and obtained an unju&s;t &s;en|tence from Pilate, and offered him every indignity and cruel in&s;ult, and now fol|lowing him to the place of his cruci|fixion, the &s;acred hi&s;tory informs us, "And there were al&s;o two others, male|factors, led with him to be put to death. And when they were come to the place which is called Calvary, there they cru|cified him, and the malefactors; one on the right hand, and the other on the left. Then &s;aid Je&s;us, Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do. And they parted his raiment, and ca&s;t lots. And the people &s;tood beholding: and the rulers al&s;o with them derided <HI>him,</HI> &s;aying, He &s;aved others; let him &s;ave
<PB N="5" REF="032292_0004_0FF1B6D1ACB16FD0">
him&s;elf, if he be Chri&s;t, the cho&s;en of God. And the &s;oldiers al&s;o mocked him, coming to him, and offering him vinegar, And &s;aying, if thou be the king of the Jews, &s;ave thy&s;elf. And a &s;u|per&s;cription al&s;o was written over him in letters of Greek, and Latin, and He|brew, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS. And one of the malefactors which were hanged railed on him, &s;ay|ing, If thou be Chri&s;t, &s;ave thy&s;elf and us. But the other an&s;wering, rebuked him, &s;aying, Do&s;t not thou fear God, &s;eeing thou art in the &s;ame condemna|tion? And we indeed ju&s;tly; for we re|ceive the due reward of our deeds: but this man hath done nothing ami&s;s. And he &s;aid unto Je&s;us, Lord, remember me when thou come&s;t into thy kingdom. And Je&s;us &s;aid unto him, Verily I &s;ay unto thee, To-day &s;halt thou be with me in paradi&s;e." The ill temper of the Jews and of the &s;oldiers towards the divine Saviour, on this tragical occa&s;ion, cer|tainly exceeded in malignity, what is common to mankind, again&s;t their wor&s;t enemies, when they behold them in &s;uch &s;uffering, dying &s;cenes. Few, very few, can be di&s;po&s;ed to mockery and deri&s;ion in &s;uch dreadful extremities. But the one of the malefactors which were hang|ed,
<PB N="6" REF="032292_0005_0FF1B6D6311BDE70">
"railing on him, &s;aying, if thou be Chri&s;t, &s;ave thy&s;elf and us," argues a hardened, wicked heart, a mixture of &s;tupidity and malignity of &s;oul, hardly to be conceived; and to the &s;en&s;ibility of human, chri&s;tian feelings, mo&s;t awful to contemplate. He impiou&s;ly &s;coffs, he mocks at death, and when he him&s;elf is hanging and dying on the cro&s;s: he &s;coffs, he mocks at the innocent, ble&s;&s;ed expiring Saviour: he &s;coffs, he mocks at his Judge, on the verge of eternity, and when going immediately to appear before his dread tribunal. But what a contra&s;t of character to this appears in the other malefactor? "The other an|&s;wering, rebuked him, &s;aying, do&s;t thou not fear God, &s;eeing thou art in the &s;ame condemnation? And we indeed ju&s;tly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds, but this man hath done nothing ami&s;s. And he &s;aid unto Je&s;us, Lord; remember me, when thou come&s;t into thy kingdom." What &s;entiments are the&s;e? how &s;uited to the occa&s;ion? to his own circum&s;tances? to the &s;tate of the other malefactor? and to the true character of the crucified Je&s;us? A ge|nuine thorough conver&s;ion, a &s;incere, unfeigned repentance, a true faith, vi|gorous and active in the divine Re|deemer,
<PB N="7" REF="032292_0006_0FF1B6D7D8FF1028">
appears in a mo&s;t con&s;picuous manner, the fruits of it unequivocal, exerci&s;ed and acted out, in the mo&s;t evident and eminent degrees, in the mo&s;t trying circum&s;tances. He mo&s;t humbly acknowledges his guilt, mo&s;t ju&s;tly re|bukes the dreadful impiety of the other malefactor, who railed on Chri&s;t, without any fear of God, in his own awful cir|cum&s;tances, and when he him&s;elf was in the &s;uburbs of Hell, launching into Eternity. And while he acknowledges that they both &s;uffer ju&s;tly, and receive the due reward of their deeds, he a&s;&s;erts the intire innocence of the &s;uffering Sa|viour, and a&s;&s;ents, with undoubting a&s;|&s;urance, with hearty affiance and recum|bency of &s;oul, to the character he had a&s;&s;umed, as the Saviour of his people, the King of I&s;rael, the King of Zion. "This man, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> hath done nothing ami&s;s. Lord, remember me when thou come&s;t into thy kingdom." He &s;aw through all the darkne&s;s of the tragical &s;cene, through all the contradictions and railings of &s;inners, through all the tortures and ignominy of the cro&s;s; he &s;aw through all the&s;e things, through all &s;ur|rounding circum&s;tances, however harden|ing to others, and made a &s;ubject for mocking and railing; he &s;aw, inlight|ened
<PB N="8" REF="032292_0007_0FF1B6DC5BF3C6E8">
by the divine &s;pirit, and renewed and changed by the power of divine grace; he &s;aw, he believed in the glori|ous, wonderful character of Immanuel, the de&s;ign of his coming into the world, and that he, and he alone, was "able to &s;ave to the uttermo&s;t all them that come unto God by him." He had ju&s;t views of his "kingdom" as not "of this world," but leading and advancing all his faithful followers and &s;ubjects to im|mortal life, happine&s;s and glory, in a future world. He a&s;ks no relief from temporal &s;ufferings, he a&s;ks not for tem|poral life, though doubtle&s;s, he knew that Chri&s;t was able, if he plea&s;ed, to grant it to him; and to come down from the cro&s;s him&s;elf, and confound and de|&s;troy all his enemies in a moment. He owns the ju&s;tice of his own puni&s;hment in the article of death, and meekly re|&s;igns him&s;elf; only praying, and pour|ing out his &s;oul, in penitence and faith, "Lord, remember me, when thou come&s;t into thy kingdom," q. d. 'Ble&s;&s;ed Je&s;us, intere&s;t me in thy divine love, and graciou&s;ly remember me, and number me among&s;t thy redeemed, in that glo|rious and eternal kingdom, which thou do&s;t purcha&s;e for them, and in which thou wilt make them ble&s;&s;ed and happy
<PB N="9" REF="032292_0008_0FF1B6DDE30F28A0">
forever, at an infinite remove from all the &s;ins and &s;ufferings of the pre&s;ent &s;tate.' With a chri&s;tian &s;pirit he was willing to "&s;uffer with him," that he might "al&s;o reign with him." He owned, he honored Chri&s;t&mdash;he committed him&s;elf, his immortal &s;oul to his care, when others, his friends, and his own di&s;ciples for&s;ook him and fled. "I can|not, therefore, (&s;ays one<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Doddridge&mdash;note upon this pa&s;&s;age.</NOTE>) but look on this happy man, (for &s;uch, amid&s;t all the ignominy and torture of the cro&s;s, he &s;urely was) as a glorious in&s;tance of the power, as well as &s;overeignty of divine grace, which (as many have ob&s;erved) perhaps taking the fir&s;t occa&s;ion from the preternatural darkne&s;s, wrought &s;o powerfully, as to produce, by a &s;udden and a&s;toni&s;hing growth in his la&s;t mo|ments, all the virtues that could be croud|ed into &s;o &s;mall a &s;pace, and which were eminently manife&s;ted in his confe&s;&s;ing his own guilt, in his admoni&s;hing his companion for a crime, which he feared would prove fatal to him, in his vindi|cating the character of Chri&s;t, and re|po&s;ing his confidence in him, as the Lord of a Kingdom beyond the grave, when his enemies were triumphing over him,
<PB N="10" REF="032292_0009_0FF1B6E2660BBB18">
and he him&s;elf, abandoned by mo&s;t of his friends, was expiring on the cro&s;s."</P>
<P>And the ble&s;&s;ed Je&s;us, who &s;eems to have taken no other notice of his cruel murderers than to pray for them "Fa|ther, forgive them; for they know not what they do," no &s;ooner hears the meek, the humble, fervent petition of this dy|ing penitent, than he returns a mo&s;t gra|cious an&s;wer. "He &s;aid unto Je&s;us, Lord, remember me when thou come&s;t into thy kingdom. And Je&s;us &s;aid unto him, verily I &s;ay unto thee, To-day &s;halt thou be with me in Paradi&s;e." What love and Grace! What dignity and power? What proof of his Divine mi&s;|&s;ion and Go&s;pel! What encouragement! What &s;ure ground of Hope to every humble penitent, dying Sinner, appears here in the depth of the aba&s;ement and &s;ufferings of the Son of God! in his own dying moments, giving immortal life to a dying &s;inner, and a&s;&s;uring the believing penitent that he &s;hould be with him that very day in Paradi&s;e! That notwith|&s;tanding the crucifixion and death of the body, immediately upon his mortal di&s;|&s;olution, his immortal &s;pirit &s;hould be with him, in another life and world, happy, completely happy in his pre&s;ence, and in the joys of the Paradi&s;e of God!</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="032292_0010_0FF1B6E5786DF410">To comprize the ideas &s;ugge&s;ted in the text in a &s;hort compa&s;s, and one con|nected view, and impre&s;s them the more &s;trongly upon the mind, I &s;ubjoin the paraphra&s;e of Dr. Doddridge. "And one of the malefactors al&s;o, who hung on the cro&s;s with him, regardle&s;s of that innocence and dignity which Je&s;us ma|nife&s;ted under all his &s;ufferings, and un|affected with a &s;en&s;e of his own aggra|vated guilt, upbraided him with the &s;ame reproach, and &s;cornfully bla&s;phemed him as an impo&s;tor, &s;aying, if thou art the Me&s;&s;iah, why do&s;t thou not &s;ave thy&s;elf and us, who are now dying with thee? But the other awakened to a &s;en&s;e of his &s;in, and convinced in his heart that Je&s;us was indeed the promi&s;ed Me&s;&s;iah, an|&s;wered his companion, and rebuked him, &s;aying, do&s;t thou not fear God, even now when thou thy&s;elf art in the &s;ame con|demnation? In &s;uch an awful circum|&s;tance as this do&s;t thou dare to increa&s;e thy crimes with thy dying breath, and to behave thy&s;elf &s;o in&s;olently in the im|mediate view of God's righteous tribu|nal? And we indeed are ju&s;tly thus con|demned; for we receive no more than what is due for the notorious crimes we have committed: but this man has done nothing by any means ami&s;s, nor is there

the lea&s;t in&s;olence, or ab&s;urdity in that high claim which he has made, though appearances be for the pre&s;ent &s;o much again&s;t it. And having thus rebuked his companion, and te&s;tified his full per|&s;ua&s;ion of the innocence of Je&s;us, he then directed his di&s;cour&s;e to him, and &s;aid to Je&s;us, looking upon him with the humble&s;t and the mo&s;t contrite regard. Lord, though this wretch derides thy mi&s;&s;ion, I firmly believe it; and I beg, that though would&s;t graciou&s;ly remem|ber me, when thou come&s;t into that thy kingdom, to which I doubt not but God will rai&s;e thee in &s;pite of death and hell. And Je&s;us turning towards him, &s;aid to him with a mixture of the greate&s;t dig|nity and mercy, Verily I &s;ay unto thee, and &s;olemnly a&s;&s;ure thee of it as a mo&s;t certain truth, that this very day thou &s;halt be with me in Paradi&s;e, &s;haring the entertainments of that garden of God, the abode of happy &s;pirits when &s;eparate from the body; and there &s;hall thy de|parting &s;oul, as &s;oon as thou ha&s;t breathed thy la&s;t, immediately begin to reap the fruits of that faith, which breaks through &s;o dark a cloud, and honours me, in the mid&s;t of this infamy and di&s;tre&s;s."</P>
<P>A man, a fellow mortal, an acquaint|ance, a relation, who hath by his crimes
<PB N="13" REF="032292_0012_0FF1B6EA08ECF920">
forfeited his life, and by the laws of God and man, mu&s;t have his life taken from him, and die a violent death by the &s;word of civil ju&s;tice, affords a very awful &s;pec|tacle; a &s;pectacle, heart affecting, and affecting in proportion as we have feel|ing hearts, and are connected by any &s;pecial ties of friend&s;hip or kindred with the &s;uffering criminal. Yet &s;uch an one, (neither murderers, nor any other the vile&s;t &s;inners of mankind are excluded) may have recour&s;e to the mercies of God through Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and by faith and repentance obtain forgivene&s;s and ac|ceptance with God, and on the day of his execution upon earth, be tran&s;lated from an ignominious death to be with Chri&s;t in Paradi&s;e: while the lea&s;t &s;in, however unknown and irreprehen&s;ible by men, unrepented of, and unforgiven, will &s;ink the impenitent and unbelieving into everla&s;ting darkne&s;s and de&s;pair. Alarming thought! Let formali&s;ts and hypocrites, who&s;e chief concern is to make a fair &s;hew in the fle&s;h, and appear well in the eyes of their fellow men, hear, fear and tremble; repent and be|lieve and obey the go&s;pel, le&s;t while a penitent malefactor, expiring on a cro&s;s or a gallows, is immediately received to be with his ble&s;&s;ed Redeemer, they them|&s;elves,
<PB N="14" REF="032292_0013_0FF1B6F1984BECC8">
though they die a natural death, and have a burial honorable in the &s;ight of men, lift up their eyes in torments, and can only &s;ee &s;uch penitent redeemed ones afar off in man&s;ions of bli&s;s, but mu&s;t forever de&s;pair of joining them there. How? where? in what horror and deba&s;ement mu&s;t &s;uch hypocritical &s;inners appear, who are &s;o fitly compar|ed by our Lord, "to whited &s;epulchres, which indeed appear beautiful outward, but within are full of dead mens' bones, and of all uncleanne&s;s." So they appear outwardly righteous in the &s;ight of men, but their hearts are full of all manner of iniquity and wickedne&s;s. "For (&s;ays our Saviour, ye are as graves which appear not, and the men that walk over them, are not aware of them." Not any kinds or degrees of &s;in and guilt, &s;inners of no &s;ort, nation, or character are excluded from mercy, except they exclude them|&s;elves by an ob&s;tinate refu&s;al of mercy, and by wilful, malignant per&s;everance in impenitence and unbelief. The great God proclaims his name, Exod. 34.5, &amp;c. "The Lord, the Lord God, merciful and gracious, long &s;uffering, and abun|dant in goodne&s;s and truth, forgiving iniquity&punc; tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion and &s;in;" and that will by no means clear the guilty,

<P>Thomas Starr, to you my di&s;cour&s;e is directed, to you applied, and on your attention and improvement, your all de|pends. You have had, to my per&s;onal knowledge, a fair, a candid trial before man; you have had the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of mo&s;t able coun&s;ellors and advocates, who in managing your cau&s;e appeared to adduce every argument and motive that might po&s;&s;ibly operate in your favour.</P>
<P>Your ca&s;e was &s;uch as by the laws of God, as well as tho&s;e of your country, could not be otherwi&s;e ju&s;tly decided by an earthly tribunal. Though the mer|ciful God and Father of us all <HI>can</HI> and <HI>will</HI> pardon murder, as well as other &s;ins, with re&s;pect to the penitent and believing, yet he hath re&s;tricted human judicatories, and given us &s;pecial directi|on, that <HI>who&s;oever &s;heddeth man's blood, by man &s;hall his blood be &s;hed.</HI> But <HI>as the Heavens are high above the Earth, &s;o,</HI> &s;aith the ble&s;&s;ed God, <HI>are my ways above your ways, and my thoughts above your thoughts.</HI> You are indeed <HI>in a great &s;trait,</HI> but in the article of death, and of mortal execution, ble&s;s God, that though you are falling under, yet, you will no longer fall into, the hands of men, but
<PB N="16" REF="032292_0015_0FF1B6F622F52860">
<HI>fall into the hand of the Lord; for his mercies are great.</HI> Serious, inexpre&s;&s;ible &s;erious, are your pre&s;ent circum&s;tances; your la&s;t hour, your la&s;t moment is this day ha&s;tening upon you. You are con|demned, and to be cut off from the land of the living. You are going from a temporal to an eternal &s;entence, from a human to a divine tribunal, from the execution of a &s;entence which re&s;pects only your body and mortal life, to &s;tand before the judgment &s;eat of Chri&s;t, and receive a &s;entence from him for &s;oul and body to all eternity. And what awful attention do the words of the ble&s;&s;ed. Saviour to his di&s;ciples in the days of his fle&s;h demand from you in your pre|&s;ent condition? Luke 12.4, 5. "Be not afraid of them that kill the body, and after that have no more that they can do. But I will forewarn you whom ye &s;hall fear: fear him which, after he hath killed, hath power to ca&s;t into hell; yea, I &s;ay unto you, fear him."</P>
<P>You are ju&s;tly under a &s;entence of con|demnation: The execution of it mu&s;t fall upon you. No way of e&s;cape re|mains for you. The plain and awful words of holy &s;cripture, &s;hut you up in ab&s;olute de&s;pair, with re&s;pect to the lea&s;t ray of hope to prolong your life to another day. You will never &s;ee the

You have not only done violence to the blood of a fellow mortal&mdash;you have &s;hed kindred blood. You have wounded the feelings of your deare&s;t friends, in the tendere&s;t manner. You will be &s;oon in the place of execution, and &s;uffer the puni&s;hment you ju&s;tly de&s;erve from the laws of your country. A ju&s;t and pro|per &s;en&s;e of your &s;in, deep repentance, faith in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, in &s;hort, a temper like that of the dying penitent in my text, you mu&s;t now have, as you would wi&s;h for pardon and acceptance with God. You have the &s;ame ble&s;&s;ed, al|mighty, mo&s;t merciful Saviour, to look to, that he had. <HI>A new heart, and a new &s;pirit</HI> you want; May the God of mercy give it to you. Pray, pray for it, while life, and any moment of life, before you are launched into eternity, &s;hall remain to you: let your whole &s;oul, in all the ardency of importunity, be going forth to Je&s;us, the Saviour, in language like that in the text, "Lord, remember me in thy kingdom." And know, that though Je&s;us is ab&s;ent now, in bodily pre&s;ence from you, yet from his exalted throne his eyes are upon you, and in his divine &s;pirit he is pre&s;ent with you, and if
<PB N="18" REF="032292_0017_0FF1B6F958E02A00">
you have but the temper, and make the petition of the dying penitent who was executed with his crucified Saviour, a like an&s;wer will be applied to you, as the Saviour made to him, and verily, this day &s;halt thou be with him in Para|di&s;e. Every humane &s;pectator is ten|derly moved, the hearts of your friends are bleeding for you. Can yours be le&s;s affected for your&s;elf?

<HEAD>LIFE AND CHARACTER OF THOMAS STARR, WHO WAS EXECUTED AT HADDAM,
<DATE>ON WED|NESDAY JUNE 14, 1797,</DATE>
FOR THE MURDER OF SAMUEL CORNWELL.</HEAD>
<P>THOMAS STARR was born in Middle|town, April 23, 1753. His parents and family, and their connections were reputable. His youthful genius was promi&s;ing. His im|provements under the common advantages of &s;chooling were uncommon. He manife&s;ted a ta&s;te for books. In writing and penman&s;hip he excelled. In mu&s;ic and p&s;almody be made laudable proficiency, and was an approved leader in that part of public wor&s;hip in the place where the Providence of God ca&s;t his re&s;idence in early manhood. His manners and deportment were conciliating, and attracted the favour|able notice of his acquaintance, whether of elder or younger, or of equal age with him&s;elf. Thus promi&s;ing was the young man, when an unhappy &s;tep CHANGED ALL THE COLOUR OF HIS FATE. Connected with a worthy fa|mily, and contracted in matrimonial engage|ments with an amiable and only daughter of it, by ungentlemanly and capricious conduct he lo&s;t that affection of which he thought him&s;elf, in his vain confidence, too &s;ure, and met with a

Con|&s;cious, no doubt, of his ill behaviour to the friend of his choice, and feeling the &s;trong ope|ration of that affection his heart bore her, and which before he knew not how properly to e&s;ti|mate&mdash;&s;tung with &s;hame and remor&s;e&mdash;from be|ing &s;ociable and conver&s;ible with his friends, he &s;hunned &s;ociety, e&s;pecially that &s;ociety which was once his choice and his honor, &s;unk by de|grees into the various &s;tages of intemperance and debauchery; and cho&s;e for his companions &s;uch as were addicted to the &s;ame indulgencies, and with them in gloomy retirement, and with a manife&s;t aver&s;ion to the company of the vir|tuous and reputable, and e&s;pecially of tho&s;e of the fairer &s;ex, he &s;pent mo&s;t of his &s;ocial hours, and particularly the Holy Sabbath, and Saturday and Sabbath Evenings. This abandonment of moral virtuous character paved the way, and was very con&s;picuous immediately previous to his doing, in a mo&s;t tragical manner, violence to innocent and kindred blood, for which awful Crime, by the Laws of God and his Country, he &s;uffered a violent and untimely Death.</P>
