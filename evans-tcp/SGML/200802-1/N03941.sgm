<HEAD>A LETTER, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>NEW-YORK,
<DATE>Nov. 1, 1740.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>My dear Friends,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>LAST Night and this Morning I read your Queries and Scruples. Whether they were compiled by Church Members or Mini&s;ters of the Presbyterian Per&s;ua&s;ion, I &s;hall not take upon me to determine. I think I may &s;ay, with <HI>David</HI> on another Occa&s;ion, <HI>Joab's Hand is in this</HI> If your Mini&s;ters were really the Authors, and you only their Repre&s;entatives, they have not acted &s;imply. They had better have &s;poken out. I &s;hould as readily have an&s;wered them as you. <HI>Solomon</HI> &s;ays, <HI>He that hateth Reproof, is Bruti&s;h</HI>: And if I know any thing of my own Heart, I &s;hould think my&s;elf obliged to any one that convinces me of any Error, either in Principle or Practice. I therefore a&s;&s;ure you, that I do not find the lea&s;t Re&s;entment &s;tirring in my Soul again&s;t tho&s;e (whoever they be) that propo&s;ed the <HI>Queries,</HI> or a|gain&s;t the Rev. <HI>Pre&s;bytery</HI> that advi&s;ed you to &s;end them to me in a Publick Manner: No, I rejoice in it; becau&s;e it gives me an Opportunity of doing what my Friends know I have for &s;ome time propo&s;ed, <HI>viz.</HI> To correct &s;ome Pa&s;&s;ages in my printed Sermons. I think it no Di&s;honour to retract &s;ome Expre&s;&s;ions that have formerly dropped from my Pen, before God was plea&s;ed to give me a more clear Knowledge of the Doctrines of Grace. St. <HI>Au&s;tin</HI> I think, did &s;o before me. The Lord's Dealing with me was &s;omething out of the common Way. I can &s;ay, to the Honour of rich free di&s;tingui&s;hing Grace, that I received the Spirit of Adoption before I had conver&s;ed with one Man, or read a &s;ingle Book, on the Doctrine of <HI>Free Ju&s;tification by the imputed Righteou&s;ne&s;s of</HI> JESUS CHRIST. No Wonder then, that I was not &s;o clear in &s;ome Points at my fir&s;t Setting out in the Mini&s;try. Our LORD was plea&s;ed to enlighten me by Degrees; and I de&s;ire your Prayers, that his Grace may &s;hine more and more in my Heart, till it breaks forth into perfect Day.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="004859_0004_100E038E4F788688">But to come to the exceptionable Pa&s;&s;ages in my Sermons. You blame me for &s;aying,</P>
<P><HI>Page</HI> 17. <HI>Vol.</HI> 2d. <HI>That</HI> Adam <HI>was adorned with all the Perfections of the Deity.</HI> I acknowledge this is not &s;ufficiently explain'd. It &s;hould have been expre&s;s'd thus, "All the <HI>moral communicable</HI> Perfections of the Deity." tho' perhaps not one of my Readers really thought I meant any others. Again, <HI>Man was the Perfection of the</HI> moral <HI>and</HI> material <HI>World.</HI> Let it &s;tand thus, "The Perfection of the <HI>vi&s;ible</HI> World"</P>
<P><HI>P.</HI> 22. &amp; 23. <HI>Vol.</HI> 2<HI>d.</HI> where &s;peaking of a godly Man's ri&s;ing by Repentance after a Fall into Sin, I &s;ay, <HI>Wa&s;hes the Guilt of Sin away by the Tears of a &s;incere Repentance joined with Faith in the Blood of</HI> JESUS CHRIST." &mdash; This is fal&s;e Divinity; &mdash; I would now alter it thus, &mdash;
<Q>Recovers his former Peace, by re|newing his Acts of Faith on the perfect Righteou&s;|ne&s;s of JESUS CHRIST.</Q></P>
<P><HI>P.</HI> 79. <HI>Vol</HI> 1, where &s;peaking of making the Glory of God our End, I &s;ay, <HI>And which</HI> alone <HI>can render any of our Actions acceptable in God's Sight</HI>"&mdash;It &s;hould be&mdash;
<Q>And without which <HI>any</HI> of our Actions cannot be acceptable in God's Sight.</Q></P>
<P><HI>P.</HI> 16, <HI>Vol.</HI> 1. where I &s;peak of &s;ome <HI>Who vainly</HI> depend <HI>on their own Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and not on the Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s of</HI> Je&s;us Chri&s;t, <HI>imputed to and inherent in them, as nece&s;&s;ary to their eternal Salvation.</HI>" &mdash; To avoid all Mi&s;takes, I would expre&s;s my&s;elf in this Manner, &mdash;
<Q>Who have neither <HI>Chri&s;t</HI>'s Righteou&s;ne&s;s imputed to them for their Ju&s;tification in the Sight of God, nor Holine&s;s wrought in their Souls as the Con&s;e|quence of that, in order to make them <HI>meet</HI> for the Enjoyment of God.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Vol.</HI> 1, <HI>p.</HI> 7. where it &s;tands thus, <HI>We mu&s;t be new Creatures in order to qualify us for</HI> being &s;avingly <HI>in Chri&s;t,</HI> read, "to qualify us for <HI>living eternally</HI> with Chri&s;t."</P>
<P>The &s;eeming Contradiction in my Sermon, <HI>Vol.</HI> 2, <HI>p.</HI> 128, compar'd with <HI>Vol.</HI> 2, <HI>p.</HI> 137, I think may be reconciled by that Pa&s;&s;age of the Apo&s;tle, <HI>After you believed you were &s;ealed by the Spirit of Promi&s;e</HI> Your arguing on this, <HI>Page</HI> 20, <HI>Sect</HI> 7, I think is not quite &s;o clear. Might you not have as rea&s;onably blamed

<HI>Ie&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> for &s;aying to a dead Man, <HI>Lazarus come forth</HI>? However, in&s;tead of <HI>quickning Spirit,</HI>" <HI>Vol.</HI> 2. <HI>p.</HI> 137, Let it be read, "&s;anctifying Spirit."</P>
<P><HI>Vol.</HI> 2. <HI>P.</HI> 33. where it is now read, <HI>The Man Chri&s;t Ie&s;us is &s;piritually formed in your Hearts.</HI>&mdash;I would alter it thus, "That Chri&s;t is formed within you."</P>
<P><HI>Vol.</HI> 1. <HI>p</HI> 53, <HI>The many Souls that are nouri&s;hed weekly by the &s;piritual Body and Blood of Je&s;us Chri&s;t by your Means.</HI> &mdash;Let it be alter'd for the&s;e Words,
<Q>Nouri&s;h'd weekly at the Lord's Supper by your Means.</Q></P>
<P>I &s;ee no rea&s;on to alter my Explanation of the Words, <HI>Baptizing them into the</HI> Nature <HI>of the Father, Son and Holy Gho&s;t</HI>; and, <HI>Chri&s;t &s;piritually conceived in the Heart of</HI> Eve. &mdash; I mean no more by the&s;e Expre&s;&s;ions than the Apo&s;tle, when he &s;ays, <HI>Know you not that Chri&s;t is in you, unle&s;s you be Reprobates?</HI> And again, <HI>We are made Partakers of the Divine Nature.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Vol.</HI> 2, <HI>p.</HI> 128, The&s;e Words <HI>[In the Lord's Prayer]</HI> may be left out. Tho' if the Word <HI>Name</HI> &s;ignifies God's Attributes according to your own Confe&s;&s;ion, why may it not &s;ignify his E&s;&s;ence? What are God's Attributes but GOD him&s;elf?</P>
<P><HI>Vol.</HI> 1 <HI>p.</HI> 14 After <HI>e&s;&s;ential ones too,</HI> in&s;ert, "if Per&s;ons are capable of performing them" And by <HI>e&s;&s;ential</HI> is meant <HI>nece&s;&s;ary</HI> in that Order of Means which God has appointed.</P>
<P>THESE, if I mi&s;take not, are all the Pa&s;&s;ages in my Sermons which you object again&s;t.&mdash; And now to con|vince you that I am not a&s;hamed to own my Faults, I can inform you of other Pa&s;&s;ages as ju&s;tly exceptionable. &mdash; In my Sermon on <HI>Ju&s;tification,</HI> I &s;eem to a&s;&s;ert <HI>Univer&s;al Redemption,</HI> which I now ab&s;olutely deny. &mdash; In my <HI>Almo&s;t Chri&s;tian,</HI> I talk of Works procuring us &s;o high a Crown.&mdash;In my Sermon on the <HI>Marks of the New Birth,</HI> I &s;ay, <HI>We &s;hall endure to the End, if we continue &amp;c.</HI> &mdash;The&s;e and perhaps &s;ome other Pa&s;&s;ages, tho' capable of a candid Interpretation, I now mi&s;like, and in the next Edition of my Sermons, God willing, I propo&s;e to alter them.&mdash;In the mean while I &s;hall be thankful to any that will point out my Errors, and I promi&s;e, by divine A&s;&s;i&s;tance, they &s;hall have no Rea&s;on to &s;ay,
<PB N="5" REF="004859_0006_100E039201ED4D28">
that I am one who hates to be reformed &mdash;<HI>Let the Righ|teous &s;mite me, it &s;hall be a Kindne&s;s; and let him reprove me, it &s;hall be an excellent Oil, which &s;hall not break my Head: for yet my Prayer al&s;o &s;hall be in their Calamities.</HI></P>
<P>As for your In&s;inuating that I countenance Mr. <HI>We&s;ly</HI> in his Errors, it is no &s;uch Thing. &mdash; I prefaced <HI>Halyburton</HI>'s Memoirs before I &s;aw what Mr. <HI>We&s;ly</HI> wrote. And &s;ince I have &s;een it have more than once &s;aid, If I had known what Mr. <HI>We&s;ley</HI> had wrote I would not have prefaced the Book at all. &mdash; I do not under&s;tand Mr. <HI>We&s;ly</HI> in his Interpretation of tho&s;e Words, <HI>He that is born again of God &s;inneth not</HI>; and therefore have torn that Part of his Preface out of &s;e|veral of tho&s;e Books which I have given away lately, and have acquainted him wherein I think he errs in this particular, in &s;undry of my Letters.</P>
<P>You wrong me if you think I am an <HI>Antinomian.</HI> &mdash; For when I &s;ay, <HI>God made no &s;econd Covenant with</HI> Adam, I mean no more than this, &mdash;
<Q>God made no &s;econd Covenant with <HI>Adam</HI> in his own Per&s;on in behalf of his Po&s;terity. Nor did Man's Acceptance in the Sight of God after the Fall, depend either wholly or in part on his Works, as before the Fall.&mdash;</Q>
Whoever reads the Author of <HI>The Whole Duty of Man,</HI> will find he thinks otherwi&s;e; and I believe your Friends in <HI>Scotland</HI> will not thank you for defending <HI>The Whole Duty of Man,</HI> as you &s;eemingly have done in your late Queries.</P>
<P>Your Objection concerning my favourable Opinion of &s;ome particular <HI>Quakers</HI> I conver&s;ed with, and al&s;o about &s;ome <HI>particular Promi&s;es</HI> which I think have been made me, you may &s;ee &s;atisfied in my An&s;wer to the Bi&s;hop of <HI>London</HI>'s la&s;t pa&s;toral Letter, and in a Letter &s;ent to the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Glouce&s;ter,</HI> and publi&s;hed in one part of my Journals.</P>
<P>I am no Friend to <HI>ca&s;ting Lots</HI>; but I believe, on <HI>extraordinary Occa&s;ions,</HI> when Things can be determined no other way, God, if appeal'd to and waited on by Prayer and Fa&s;ting, will an&s;wer by Lot <HI>now</HI> as well as formerly.</P>
<P>You condemn me for preaching <HI>extempore,</HI> and &s;ay|ing I am helped often <HI>immediately</HI> in that Exerci&s;e:
<PB N="6" REF="004859_0007_100E0393C2336A60">
But thou&s;ands as well as my&s;elf are thankful for the &s;pecial A&s;&s;i&s;tances which God has afforded me in that Exerci&s;e. &mdash; You likewi&s;e cen&s;ure me as one that would lay a&s;ide Reading; but I am of Bi&s;hop <HI>Sander|&s;on</HI>'s Mind, <HI>Study without Prayer is Athei&s;m; Prayer without Study, Pre&s;umption.</HI> &mdash; Blame me not for the Warmth of &s;ome of my Adherents, as you call them. One of your Mini&s;ters knows, how &s;harply I rebuked one of them for his Warmth at <HI>Fog's Mannor.</HI> I am for loving as Brethren, and wi&s;h all would copy after the lowly JESUS. &mdash; But then I cannot di&s;commend tho&s;e (&s;uppo&s;ing they do it in the Spirit of Meekne&s;s) who exclaim again&s;t <HI>dry &s;aple&s;s unconverted</HI> Mini&s;ters &mdash; Such &s;urely are the Bane of the Chri&s;tian Church.</P>
<P>But my other Affairs will not permit me to enlarge. Some of the latter part of your <HI>Queries,</HI> for your <HI>own</HI> and not my Sake, I &s;hall not mention.&mdash;I hope I can&s;ay with more Sincerity than <HI>Hazael, Is your Servant a Dog that he &s;hould do</HI> what you &s;ugge&s;t? &mdash; But I pray God forgive you.&mdash;He knows my Heart.&mdash; My one De&s;ign is to bring poor Souls to <HI>Ie&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI>&mdash; I de&s;ire to avoid Extremes, &s;o as not to be a Bigot on the one Hand, or confound Order and Decency on the other. &mdash; And I could heartily wi&s;h the <HI>Reverend Presbytery</HI> when they advi&s;ed you to publi&s;h your <HI>Queries,</HI> had al&s;o cautioned you again&s;t dipping your Pen in &s;o much Gall. &mdash; Surely your In&s;inuations are contrary to that <HI>Charity</HI> that hopeth and believeth all Things for the be&s;t. And I appeal to your own Hearts, whether it was right, e&s;pecially &s;ince you heard the con&s;tant Tenor of my preaching in <HI>America</HI> has been <HI>Calvini&s;tical,</HI> to cen&s;ure me as a <HI>Papi&s;t</HI> or <HI>Arminian,</HI> becau&s;e a few unguarded Expre&s;&s;ions dropped from my Pen ju&s;t as I came out of the Univer&s;ity of <HI>Oxford?</HI>&mdash;Could Archbi&s;hop <HI>Tillot&s;on,</HI> or the Author of <HI>The whole Duty of Man,</HI> &s;ay &s;o? &mdash; But I have done &mdash;The LORD be with you &mdash; I am a poor frail Creature: And as &s;uch, I be&s;eech you to pray for</P>

<SALUTE>Reverend Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE &s;een your printed An&s;wer to certain <HI>Que|ries</HI> lately publi&s;hed, and ob&s;erve with great Satis|faction, the Evidence you there give of a truely Chri|&s;tian Humility. And it is this emboldens me to tell you, that in my Opinion you have not in all Points &s;et Things right; but &s;ome of your Corrections are as liable to Exceptions as the Pa&s;&s;ages you have corrected, I will give you a Specimen: In&s;tead of,
<Q>Adam <HI>was adorned with all the Perfections of the Deity,</HI></Q>
you correct it,
<Q><HI>All the</HI> moral communicable <HI>Perfec|tions of the Deity.</HI></Q>
&mdash;Was not Man created a little lower than the Angels? And if &s;o, were there not &s;ome <HI>moral Perfections</HI> communicated to <HI>them,</HI> which were not communicated to <HI>him</HI>? For otherwi&s;e in what Sen&s;e could he be &s;aid to be <HI>inferior</HI> to them? And it would be ab&s;urd to &s;ay, that any Thing could be <HI>communicated</HI> that was not <HI>communicable.</HI> &mdash; I hope I have a true Sen&s;e of the Power and U&s;efulne&s;s of your Mini&s;try, and wi&s;h it, from my Soul and Spirit, all the Succe&s;s it de&s;erves: But at the &s;ame time &s;incerely wi&s;h, that all Errors may be removed, and every Let and Hindrance taken away.

<P>IN your An&s;wer to the <HI>Queries</HI> you &s;ay, That <Q>To the Honour of free di&s;tingui&s;hing Grace, you re|ceived the Spirit of Adoption, before you had con|ver&s;ed with one Man, or read a &s;ingle Book, on the Doctrine of <HI>Free Ju&s;tification by the imputed Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s of</HI> JESUS CHRIST; and, therefore, no Wonder that you was not &s;o clear in &s;ome Points at your fir&s;t Setting out in the Mini&s;try.</Q>
&mdash; This De|claration to me &s;eems clearly to imply, That the Spi|rit of Adoption alone, without the Aid of human Con|ver&s;ation or Books, is not &s;ufficient fully to accom|pli&s;h a Chri&s;tian Mini&s;ter, but that human Conver&s;a|tion and Books are ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, in order fur|ther to <HI>enlighten</HI> him. &mdash; As I under&s;tood you in this Sen&s;e, and further, That
<Q>it is not yet <HI>perfect</HI> Day Day with you</Q>
I concluded you would readily re|tract any of your Errors, even now, &s;ince you are not yet fully enlightened; and more e&s;pecially, as you &s;ay in your An&s;wer to the <HI>Queries,</HI>
<Q>That you &s;hall be thankful to any that will point out your Errors; and promi&s;e, by Divine A&s;&s;i&s;tance, they &s;hall have no Rea&s;on to &s;ay, that you are one who hates to be reformed.</Q>
&mdash; It was upon the Strength of this Con|clu&s;ion, that I thought it proper, not only to pray that
<Q>God's Grace might &s;hine more and more in your Heart,</Q>
but al&s;o to trouble you with my Letter of the 11th In&s;tant.</P>
<P>The high Opinion I had entertained of your great Candour, Sincerity, and Zeal for Truth, induced me to expect an An&s;wer; and I would &s;till gladly receive that Satisfaction. But as I find you have hitherto decli|ned it, and for which I am at a Lo&s;s for a good Rea&s;on; I therefore take this Occa&s;ion to let you know, That if you any <HI>longer decline</HI> doing what every Chri&s;tian En|quirer has a Right to demand of you upon &s;uch Occa|&s;ions. I will immediately call upon you in a publick Manner, by printing both this and my former Letter.</P>
