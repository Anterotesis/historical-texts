<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>READER,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THIS enchiridion, I pre&s;ent thee with, is the fruit of &s;o|litude: a &s;chool few care to learn in, though none in&s;tructs us bet|ter. Some parts of it are the re|&s;ult of &s;erious reflection; others the fla&s;hings of lucid inter|vals; written for private &s;atisfac|tion, and now publi&s;hed for an help to human conduct.</P>
<P>The author ble&s;&s;eth God for
<PB N="iv" REF="024663_0003_0FC819F6B048CF30">
his retirement, and ki&s;&s;es that gentle hand which led him into it: for though it &s;hould prove bar|ren to the world, it can never do fo to him.</P>
<P>He has now had &s;ome time he could call his own, a property he was never &s;o much ma&s;ter of be|fore: in which he has taken a view of him&s;elf and the world; and ob&s;erved wherein he hath hit and mi&s;&s;ed the mark; what might have been done, what men|ded, and what avoided, in his hu|man conduct: together with the omi&s;&s;ions and exce&s;&s;es of others, as well &s;ocieties and governments, as private families and per&s;ons. And he verily thinks, were he to live over his life again, he
<PB N="v" REF="024663_0004_0FC819FE5461C9E8">
could not only, with God's grace, &s;erve him, but his neighbour and him&s;elf, better than he hath done, and have &s;even years of his time to &s;pare. And yet, perhaps, he hath not been the wor&s;t or the idle&s;t man in the world; nor is he the olde&s;t. And this is the rather &s;aid, that it might quicken thee, reader, to lo&s;e none of the time that is yet thine.</P>
<P>There is nothing of which we are apt to be &s;o lavi&s;h as of time, and about which we ought to be more &s;olicitous; &s;ince with|out it we can do nothing in this world. Time is what we want mo&s;t, but what, alas! we u&s;e wor&s;t; and for which God will
<PB N="vi" REF="024663_0005_0FC81A010A0FAF00">
certainly mo&s;t &s;trictly reckon with us, when time &s;hall be no more.</P>
<P>It is of that moment to us in reference to both worlds, that I can hardly wi&s;h any man better, than that he would &s;eriou&s;ly con|&s;ider what he does with his time; how and to what end he employs it; and what returns he makes to God, his neighbour, and him|&s;elf for it. Will he never have a ledger for this; this, the greate&s;t wi&s;dom and work of life?</P>
<P>To come but once into the world, and trifle away our true enjoyment of it, and of our&s;elves in it, is lamentable indeed. This one reflection would yield a think|ing per&s;on great in&s;truction. And, &s;ince nothing below man can &s;o
<PB N="vii" REF="024663_0006_0FC81A06280A7148">
think, man, in being thoughtle&s;s, mu&s;t needs fall below him&s;elf. And that, to be &s;ure, &s;uch do, as are unconcerned in the u&s;e of their mo&s;t precious time.</P>
<P>This is but too evident, if we will allow our&s;elves to con&s;ider, that there is hardly any thing we take by the right end, or improve to its ju&s;t advantage.</P>
<P>We under&s;tand little of the works of God, either in nature or grace. We pur&s;ue fal&s;e know|ledge, and mi&s;take education ex|tremely. We are violent in our af|fections, confu&s;ed and immethod|ical in our whole life; making that a burthen, which was given for a ble&s;&s;ing, and &s;o of little comfort to our&s;elves or others;
<PB N="viii" REF="024663_0007_0FC81A070B9DDC98">
mi&s;apprehending the true notion of happine&s;s, and &s;o mi&s;&s;ing of the right u&s;e of life, and way of happy living.</P>
<P>And until we are per&s;uaded to &s;top, and &s;tep a little a&s;ide, out of the noi&s;y crowd and incum|bering hurry of the world, and calmly take a pro&s;pect of things, it will be impo&s;&s;ible we &s;hould be able to make a right judgment of our&s;elves, or know our own mi&s;ery. But after we have made the ju&s;t reckonings which re|tirement will help us to, we &s;hall begin to think the world in great mea&s;ure mad, and that we have been in a &s;ort of Bedlam all this while.</P>
<P>Reader, whether young or old,
<PB N="ix" REF="024663_0008_0FC81A09EA0F97E8">
think it not too &s;oon or too late to turn over the leaves of thy pa&s;t life: and be &s;ure to fold down where any pa&s;&s;age of it may af|fect thee: and be&s;tow thy re|mainder of time, to correct tho&s;e faults in thy future conduct, be it in relation to this or the next life. What thou would&s;t do, if what thou ha&s;t done were to do again, be &s;ure to do as long as thou live&s;t, upon the like occa&s;i|ons.</P>
<P>Our re&s;olutions &s;eem to be vi|gorous, as often as we reflect up|on our pa&s;t errors; but, alas! they are apt to flag again upon fre&s;h temptations to the &s;ame things.</P>
<P>The author does not pretend
<PB N="x" REF="024663_0009_0FC81A0D1BEA7FE8">
to deliver thee an exact piece; his bu&s;ine&s;s not being o&s;tentation, but charity. It is mi&s;cellaneous in the matter of it, and by no means artificial in the compo&s;ure. But it contains hints, that may &s;erve thee for texts to preach to thy&s;elf upon, and which com|prehend much of the cour&s;e of human life: &s;ince whether thou art parent or child, prince or &s;ub|ject, ma&s;ter or &s;ervant, &s;ingle or married, publick or private, mean or honourable, rich or poor, pro&s;|perous or impro&s;perous, in peace or controver&s;y, in bu&s;ine&s;s or &s;oli|tude; whatever be thy inclination or aver&s;ion, practice or duty, thou wilt find &s;omething not un&s;uita|bly &s;aid for thy direction and ad|vantage.
<PB N="xi" REF="024663_0010_0FC81A0E64171320">
Accept and improve what de&s;erves thy notice; the re&s;t excu&s;e, and place to account of good-will to thee and the whole creation of God.</P>

<HEAD>IGNORANCE.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. IT is admirable to con&s;ider how many millions of people come into and go out of the world, ignorant of them|&s;elves, and of the world they have lived in.</P>
<P N="2">2. If one went to &s;ee Wind&s;or-Ca&s;|tle, or Hampton-Court, it would be
<PB N="2" REF="024663_0020_0FC81A2E8F3DB7D8">
&s;trange not to ob&s;erve and remember the &s;ituation, the building, the gar|dens, fountains, &amp;c. that make up the beauty and plea&s;ure of &s;uch a &s;eat. And yet few people know them&s;elves: no, not their own bodies, the hou&s;es of their minds, the mo&s;t curious &s;tructure of the world; a living, walking taber|nacle; nor the world of which it was made, and out of which it is fed; which would be &s;o much our benefit, as well as our plea&s;ure, to know. We cannot doubt of this when we are told that the "invi&s;ible things of God are brought to light by the things that are &s;een;" and con&s;equently we read our duty in them, as often as we look upon them, to him that is the great and wi&s;e au|thor of them, if we look as we &s;hould do.</P>
<P N="3">3. The world is certainly a great and &s;tately volume of natural things, and may be not improperly &s;tiled the hieroglyphicks of a better; but, alas, how very few leaves of it do we &s;eri|ou&s;ly
<PB N="3" REF="024663_0021_0FC81A2F6111A708">
turn over! This ought to be the &s;ubject of the education of our youth; who, at twenty, when they &s;hould be fit for bu&s;ine&s;s, know little or nothing of it.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>EDUCATION.</HEAD>
<P N="4">4. We are in pain to make them &s;cholars, but not men; to talk, rather than to know; which is true canting.</P>
<P N="5">5. The fir&s;t thing obvious to children is what is &s;en&s;ible; and that we make no part of their rudiments.</P>
<P N="6">6. We pre&s;s their memory too &s;oon, and puzzle, &s;train, and load them with words and rules to know grammar and rhetorick, and a &s;trange tongue or two, that it is ten to one may never be u&s;eful to them; leaving their natural genius to mechanical, and phy&s;ical or natural knowledge uncultivated and neglected; which would be of ex|ceeding u&s;e and plea&s;ure to them thro' the whole cour&s;e of their lives.</P>
<P N="7"><PB N="4" REF="024663_0022_0FC81A369EBC6880">
7. To be &s;ure, languages are not to be de&s;pi&s;ed or neglected; but, things are &s;till to be preferred.</P>
<P N="8">8. Children had rather be making of tools and in&s;truments of play; &s;hap|ing, drawing, framing, and building, &amp;c. than getting &s;ome rules of propri|ety of &s;peech by heart: and tho&s;e al&s;o would follow with more judgment, and le&s;s trouble and time.</P>
<P N="9">9. It were happy if we &s;tudied na|ture more in natural things; and act|ed according to nature: who&s;e rules are few, plain, and mo&s;t rea&s;onable.</P>
<P N="10">10. Let us begin where &s;he begins, go her pace, and clo&s;e always where &s;he ends, and we cannot mi&s;s of being good naturali&s;ts.</P>
<P N="11">11. The creation would not be longer a riddle to <HI>us.</HI> The heavens, earth, and waters, with their re&s;pective, va|rious, and numerous inhabitants, their productions, natures, &s;ea&s;ons, &s;ympa|thies, and antipathies, their u&s;e, be|nefit, and plea&s;ure, would be better
<PB N="5" REF="024663_0023_0FC81A3B798F4678">
under&s;tood by us; and an eternal wi&s;|dom, power, maje&s;ty, and goodne&s;s, very con&s;picuous to us, through tho&s;e &s;en&s;ible and pa&s;&s;ing forms: the world wearing the mark of its Maker, who&s;e &s;tamp is every where vi&s;ible, and the characters very legible to the children of wi&s;dom.</P>
<P N="12">12. And it would go a great way to caution and direct people in their u&s;e of the world, that they were better &s;tudi|ed and known in the creation of it.</P>
<P N="13">13. For how could men find the con|fidence to abu&s;e it, while they &s;hould &s;ee the great Creator &s;tare them in the face, in all and every part thereof?</P>
<P N="14">14. Their ignorance makes them in|&s;en&s;ible; and to that in&s;en&s;ibility may be a&s;cribed their hard u&s;age of &s;everal parts of this noble creation: that has the &s;tamp and voice of a Deity every where, and in every thing, to the ob|&s;erving.</P>
<P N="15">15. It is pity therefore that books have not been compo&s;ed for youth, by
<PB N="6" REF="024663_0024_0FC81A3CEC65D840">
&s;ome curious and careful naturali&s;ts, and al&s;o mechanicks, in the Latin tongue, to be u&s;ed in &s;chools, that they might learn things with words: things obvious and familiar to them, and which would make the tongue ea&s;ier to be obtained by them.</P>
<P N="16">16. Many able gardeners and hu&s;|bandmen are ignorant of the rea&s;on of their calling; as mo&s;t artificers are of the rea&s;on of their own rules that go|vern their excellent workman&s;hip. But a naturali&s;t and mechanick of this &s;ort is ma&s;ter of the rea&s;on of both; and might be of the practice too, if his in|du&s;try kept pace with his &s;peculation: which were very commendable; and without which he cannot be &s;aid to be a complete naturali&s;t or mechanick.</P>
<P N="17">17. Finally, if man be the index or epitome of the world, as philo&s;ophers tell us, we have only to read our&s;elves well, to be learned in it. But becau&s;e there is nothing we le&s;s regard than the characters of the Power that made

us, which are &s;o clearly written upon us, and the world he has given us, and can be&s;t tell us what we are and &s;hould be, we are even &s;trangers to our own genius: the gla&s;s in which we &s;hould &s;ee that true, in&s;tructing, and agreea|ble variety, which is to be ob&s;erved in nature, to the admiration of that wi&s;|dom, and adoration of that power, which made us all.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">

<P N="18">18. And yet we are very apt to be full of our&s;elves, in&s;tead of him that made what we &s;o much value; and but for whom we can have no rea&s;on to va|lue our&s;elves. For we have nothing that we can call our own; no, not our|&s;elves: for we are all but tenants, and at will too, of the great Lord of our|&s;elves, and the re&s;t of this great farm, the world that we live upon.</P>
<P N="19">19. But, methinks, we cannot an&s;wer it to our&s;elves, as well as our Maker, that we &s;hould live and die ignorant
<PB N="8" REF="024663_0026_0FC81A40A0E68410">
of our&s;elves, and thereby of him, and the obligations we are under to him for our&s;elves.</P>
<P N="20">20. If the worth of a gift &s;ets the obligation, and directs the return of the party that receives it, he that is ignorant of it, will be at a lo&s;s to value it, and the giver for it.</P>
<P N="21">21. Here is man in his ignorance of him&s;elf: he knows not how to e&s;timate his Creator, becau&s;e he knows not how to value his creation. If we con&s;ider his make, and lovely compo&s;iture, the &s;everal &s;tories of his wonderful &s;truc|ture, his divers members, their order, function, and dependency; the in&s;tru|ments of food, the ve&s;&s;els of dige&s;tion, the &s;everal tran&s;mutations it pa&s;&s;es, and how nouri&s;hment is carried and diffu&s;|ed throughout the whole body, by mo&s;t intricate and imperceptible pa&s;&s;ages; how the animal &s;pirit is thereby re|fre&s;hed, and, with an un&s;peakable dex|terity and motion, &s;ets all parts at work to feed them&s;elves; and, la&s;t of all,
<PB N="9" REF="024663_0027_0FC81A4224D35E40">
how the rational &s;oul is &s;eated in the animal, as its proper hou&s;e, as is the animal in the body; I &s;ay, if this rare fabrick alone were but con&s;idered by us, with all the re&s;t by which it is fed and comforted, &s;urely man would have a more reverent &s;en&s;e of the power, wi&s;dom, and goodne&s;s of God, and of that duty he owes to him for it. But if he would be acquainted with his own &s;oul, its noble faculties, its union with the body, its nature and end, and the providences by which the whole frame of humanity is pre&s;erved, he would admire and adore his good and great God. But man is become a &s;trange contradiction to him&s;elf; but it is of him&s;elf; not being by con&s;titu|tion, but corruption, &s;uch.</P>
<P N="22">22. He would have others obey him, even his own kind; but he will not obey God, that is &s;o much above him, and who made him.</P>
<P N="23">23. He will lo&s;e none of his autho|rity; no, not bate an ace of it. He is

<HEAD>THE WORLD'S ABLE MAN.</HEAD>
<P N="14">14. It is by &s;ome thought the cha|racter of an able man, to be dark, and
<PB N="110" REF="024663_0128_0FC816F1F6CA2368">
not under&s;tood. But I am &s;ure that is not fair play.</P>
<P N="15">15. If he be &s;o by &s;ilence, it is bet|ter; but if by di&s;gui&s;es, it is in&s;incere and hateful.</P>
<P N="16">16. Secre&s;y is one thing, fal&s;e lights are another.</P>
<P N="17">17. The hone&s;t man, that is rather free than open, is ever to be preferred; e&s;pecially when &s;en&s;e is at the helm.</P>
<P N="18">18. The glorying of the other hu|mour is in a vice: for it is not human to be cold, dark, and unconver&s;able. I was going to &s;ay, they are like pick|pockets in a crowd, where a man mo&s;t ever have his hand on his pur&s;e; or as &s;pies in a garri&s;on, that, if not preven|ted, betray it.</P>
<P N="19">19. They are the rever&s;e of human nature; and yet this is the pre&s;ent world's wi&s;e man and politician: excel|lent qualities for Lapland! where, they &s;ay, witches (though not many conjurers) dwell.</P>
<P N="20">20. Like highwaymen, that rarely rob
<PB N="111" REF="024663_0129_0FC816F3955FE898">
without vizards, or in the &s;ame wigs and cloaths, but have addre&s;s for every enterprize.</P>
<P N="21">21. At be&s;t, he may be a cunning man, which is a &s;ort of lurcher in politicks.</P>
<P N="22">22. He is never too hard for the wi&s;e man upon the &s;quare; for that is out of his element, and puts him quite by his &s;kill. Nor are wi&s;e men ever catch|ed by him, but when they tru&s;t him.</P>
<P N="23">23. But as cold and clo&s;e as he &s;eems, he can and will plea&s;e all, if he gets by it; though it &s;hould neither plea&s;e God nor him&s;elf at bottom.</P>
<P N="24">24. He is for every cau&s;e that brings him gain; but implacable, if di&s;ap|pointed of &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P N="25">25. And what he cannot hinder, he will be &s;ure to &s;poil by over-doing it.</P>
<P N="26">26. None &s;o zealous then as he, for that which he cannot abide.</P>
<P N="27">27. What is it he will not, or cannot do, to hide his true &s;entiments?</P>
<P N="28">28. For his intere&s;t he refu&s;es no
<PB N="112" REF="024663_0130_0FC816F5C03E6C78">
&s;ide or party; and will take the wrong by the hand, when the other will not do, with as good a grace as the right.</P>
<P N="29">29. Nay, he commonly chu&s;es the wor&s;t, becau&s;e that brings the be&s;t bribe: his cau&s;e being ever money.</P>
<P N="30">30. He &s;ails with all winds, and is never out of his way, where any thing is to be had.</P>
<P N="31">31. A privateer, indeed, and every where a bird of prey.</P>
<P N="32">32. True to nothing but him&s;elf; and fal&s;e to all per&s;ons and parties, to &s;erve his own turn.</P>
<P N="33">33. Talk with him as often as you plea&s;e, he will never pay you in good coin; for it is either fal&s;e or clipped.</P>
<P N="34">34. But to give a fal&s;e rea&s;on for any thing, let my reader never learn of him, no more than to give a bra&s;s half-crown for a good one: not only becau&s;e it is not true, but becau&s;e it deceives the per&s;on to whom it is given; which I take to be an immorality.</P>
<P N="35"><PB N="113" REF="024663_0131_0FC816F72091AD50">
35. Silence is much more preferable; for it &s;aves the &s;ecret, as well as the per&s;on's honour.</P>
<P N="36">36. Such as give them&s;elves the lati|tude of &s;aying what they do not mean, come to be arrant jockeys at more things than one: but in religion and politicks it is pernicious.</P>
<P N="37">37. To hear two men talk the re|ver&s;e of their own &s;entiments, with all the good breeding and appearance of friend&s;hip imaginable, on purpo&s;e to co|zen or pump each other, is, to a man of virtue and honour, one of the mo&s;t me|lancholy, as well as mo&s;t nau&s;eous things in the world.</P>
<P N="38">38. But that it &s;hould be the charac|ter of an able man, is to di&s;inherit wi&s;|dom, and paint out our degeneracy to the life, by &s;etting up fraud, an arrant impo&s;tor, in her room.</P>
<P N="39">39. The trial of &s;kill between the&s;e two is, who &s;hall believe lea&s;t of what the other &s;ays; and he that has the
<PB N="114" REF="024663_0132_0FC817003B72BC18">
weakne&s;s, or good-nature, to give out fir&s;t, (<ABBR>viz.</ABBR> to believe any thing the other &s;ays) is looked upon to be tricked.</P>
<P N="40">40. I cannot &s;ee the policy, any more than the nece&s;&s;ity, of a man's mind giving the lie to his mouth; or his mouth giving fal&s;e alarms of his mind: for no man can be long believed, that teaches all men to di&s;tru&s;t him: and &s;ince the able&s;t have &s;ometimes need of credit, where lies the advantage of their politick cant or banter upon mankind?</P>
<P N="41">41. I remember a pa&s;&s;age of one of queen Elizabeth's great men, as advice to his friend: 'The advantage,' &s;ays he, 'I had upon others at court, was, that I always &s;poke as I thought; which being not believed by them, I both pre|&s;erved a good con&s;cience, and &s;uffered no damage from that freedom;' which, as it &s;hows the vice to be older than our times, &s;o does it that gallant man's in|tegrity to be the be&s;t way of avoiding it.</P>
<P N="42">42. To be &s;ure it is wi&s;e, as well as
<PB N="115" REF="024663_0133_0FC81701A009E780">
hone&s;t, neither to flatter other men's &s;entiments, nor di&s;&s;emble, and le&s;s to contradict, our own.</P>
<P N="43">43. To hold one's tongue, or to &s;peak truth, or talk only of indifferent things, is the faire&s;t conver&s;ation.</P>
<P N="44">44. Women that rarely go abroad with out vizard ma&s;ks have none of the be&s;t reputation. But when we con&s;ider what all this art and di&s;gui&s;e are for, it equally heightens the wi&s;e man's wonder and aver&s;ion; perhaps it is to betray a father, a brother, a ma&s;ter, a friend, a neighbour, or one's own party.</P>
<P N="45">45. A fine conque&s;t! what noble Grecians and Romans abhorred: as if government could not &s;ub&s;i&s;t without knavery, and that knaves were the u&s;efulle&s;t props to it; though the ba|&s;e&s;t, as well as greate&s;t, perver&s;ions of the ends of it.</P>
<P N="46">46. But that it &s;hould become a maxim, &s;hows but too gro&s;sly the cor|ruptions of the times.</P>
<P N="47"><PB N="116" REF="024663_0134_0FC81703D6D0FCF8">
47. I confe&s;s I have heard the &s;tile of 'An u&s;eful knave,' but ever took it to be a &s;illy or a knavi&s;h &s;aying; at lea&s;t an excu&s;e for knavery.</P>
<P N="48">48. Is it as rea&s;onable to think a whore makes the be&s;t wife, as a knave the be&s;t officer.</P>
<P N="49">49. Be&s;ides, employing knaves en|courages knavery, in&s;tead of puni&s;hing it, and alienates the reward of virtue: or, at lea&s;t, mu&s;t make the world believe the country yields not hone&s;t men enough, able to &s;erve her.</P>
<P N="50">50. Art thou a magi&s;trate? Prefer &s;uch as have clean characters where they live; and men of e&s;tates to &s;ecure a ju&s;t di&s;charge of their tru&s;ts, that are under no temptation to &s;train points for a fortune: for &s;ometimes &s;uch may be found &s;ooner than they are em|ployed.</P>
<P N="51">51. Art thou a private man? Con|tract thy acquaintance in a narrow compa&s;s, and chu&s;e tho&s;e for the &s;ub|jects of it that are men of principle;
<PB N="117" REF="024663_0135_0FC81704A2E9C650">
&s;uch as will make full &s;tops, where honour will not lead them on; and that had rather bear the di&s;grace of not being thorough-paced men, than forfeit their peace and reputation by a ba&s;e compliance.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>THE WISE MAN.</HEAD>
<P N="52">52. The wi&s;e man governs him&s;elf by the rea&s;on of his ca&s;e, and becau&s;e what he does is be&s;t: be&s;t, in a moral and prudent, not a &s;ini&s;ter, &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P N="53">53. He propo&s;es ju&s;t ends, and em|ploys the faire&s;t and mo&s;t probable means and methods to attain them.</P>
<P N="54">54. Though you cannot always pe|netrate his de&s;ign, or his rea&s;ons for it, yet you &s;hall ever &s;ee his actions of a piece, and his performance like a workman: they will bear the touch of wi&s;dom and honour, as often as they are tried.</P>
<P N="55">55. He &s;corns to &s;erve him&s;elf by indirect means, or to be an interloper in government; &s;ince ju&s;t enterprizes
<PB N="118" REF="024663_0136_0FC8170738236238">
never want any unju&s;t ways to make them &s;ucceed.</P>
<P N="56">56. To do evil that good may come of it is for bunglers, in politicks as as well as morals.</P>
<P N="57">57. Like tho&s;e &s;urgeons that will cut off an arm they cannot cure, to hide their ignorance and &s;ave their credit.</P>
<P N="58">58. The wi&s;e man is cautious, but not cunning; judicious, but not crafty; making virtue the mea&s;ure of u&s;ing his excellent under&s;tanding in the conduct of his life.</P>
<P N="59">59. The wi&s;e man is equal, ready, but not officious; has in every thing an eye to &s;ure-footing; he offends no body, nor is ea&s;ily offended; and is always willing to compound for wrongs, if not forgive them.</P>
<P N="60">60. He is never captious, nor criti|cal; hates banter and je&s;ts; he may be plea&s;ant, but not light; he never deals but in &s;ub&s;tantial ware, and leaves the re&s;t for the toy-pates, (or &s;hops) of the world; which are &s;o far from being
<PB N="119" REF="024663_0137_0FC8170D85AD3770">
his bu&s;ine&s;s, that they are not &s;o much as his diver&s;ion.</P>
<P N="61">61. He is always for &s;ome &s;olid good, civil or moral: as to make his country more virtuous, pre&s;erve her peace and liberty, employ her poor, improve land, advance trade, &s;uppre&s;s vice, encourage indu&s;try, and all mechanick knowledge; and that they &s;hould be the care of the government, and the ble&s;&s;ing and prai&s;e of the people.</P>
<P N="62">62. To conclude, he is ju&s;t, and fears God, hates covetou&s;ne&s;s, and e&s;chews evil, and loves his neighbour as him|&s;elf.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>OF THE GOVERNMENT OF THOUGHTS.</HEAD>
<P N="63">63. Man being made a rea&s;onable and &s;o a thinking creature, there is nothing more worthy of his being than the right direction and employment of his thoughts: &s;ince upon this de|pends both his u&s;efulne&s;s to the pub|lick, and his own pre&s;ent and future benefit in all re&s;pects.</P>
<P N="64"><PB N="120" REF="024663_0138_0FC8170FE7AE1C90">
64. The con&s;ideration of this has often obliged me to lament the un|happine&s;s of mankind, that, through too great a mixture and confu&s;ion of thoughts, have hardly been able to make a right or mature judgment of things.</P>
<P N="65">65. To this is owing the various uncertainty and confu&s;ion we &s;ee in the world, and the intemperate zeal that occa&s;ions them.</P>
<P N="66">66. To this, al&s;o, is to be attributed the imperfect knowledge we have of things, and the &s;low progre&s;s we make in attaining to a better&punc; like the chil|dren of I&s;rael, that were forty years upon their journey from Egypt to Ca|naan, which might have been per|formed in le&s;s than one.</P>
<P N="67">67. In fine, it is to this that we ought to a&s;cribe, if not all, at lea&s;t mo&s;t of the infelicities we labour un|der.</P>
<P N="68">68. Clear, therefore, thy head, and rally and manage thy thoughts rightly
<PB N="121" REF="024663_0139_0FC81711734E8D50">
and thou wilt &s;ave time, and &s;ee and do thy bu&s;ine&s;s well: for thy judgment will be di&s;tinct, thy mind free, and thy faculties &s;trong and regular.</P>
<P N="69">69. Always remember to bound thy thoughts to the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion.</P>
<P N="70">70. If it be thy religious duty, &s;uffer nothing el&s;e to &s;hare in them. And if any civil or temporal affair, ob&s;erve the &s;ame caution, and thou wilt be a whole man to every thing, and do twice the bu&s;ine&s;s in the &s;ame time.</P>
<P N="71">71. If any point over labours thy mind, divert and relieve it by &s;ome other &s;ubject, of a more &s;en&s;ible or ma|nual nature, rather than what may af|fect the under&s;tanding: for this were to write one thing upon another, which blots out our former impre&s;&s;ions, or ren|ders them illegible.</P>
<P N="72">72. They that are lea&s;t divided in their care, always give the be&s;t account of their bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P N="73">73. As, therefore, thou art always to
<PB N="122" REF="024663_0140_0FC81713A00D23A0">
pur&s;ue the pre&s;ent &s;ubject till thou ha&s;t ma&s;tered it, &s;o if it fall out that thou ha&s;t more affairs than one upon thy hand, be &s;ure to prefer that which is of mo&s;t moment, and will lea&s;t wait thy lei&s;ure.</P>
<P N="74">74. He that judges not well of the importance of his affairs, though he may be always bu&s;y, mu&s;t make but a &s;mall progre&s;s.</P>
<P N="75">75. But make not more bu&s;ine&s;s ne|ce&s;&s;ary than is &s;o; and rather le&s;&s;en than augment work for thy&s;elf.</P>
<P N="76">76. Nor yet be over-eager in pur&s;uit of any thing; for the mercurial too oft|en happen to leave judgment behind them, and &s;ometimes make work for repentance.</P>
<P N="77">77. He that over-runs his bu&s;ine&s;s, leaves it for him that follows more lei|&s;urely to take it up: which has often proved a profitable harve&s;t to them that never &s;owed.</P>
<P N="78">78. It is the advantage that &s;lower tempers have upon the men of lively
<PB N="123" REF="024663_0141_0FC81717E2F1F028">
parts, that though they do not lead, they will follow well, and glean clean.</P>
<P N="79">79. Upon the whole matter, employ thy thoughts as thy bu&s;ine&s;s requires, and let that have place according to merit and urgency, giving every thing a review and due dige&s;tion; and thou wilt prevent many errors and vexations, as well as &s;ave much time to thy&s;elf in the cour&s;e of thy life.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>OF ENVY.</HEAD>
<P N="80">80. It is the mark of ill-nature, to le&s;&s;en good actions, and aggravate ill ones.</P>
<P N="81">81. Some men do as much begrudge others a good name, as they want one them&s;elves: and perhaps that is the rea&s;on of it.</P>
<P N="82">82. But certainly they are in the wrong that can think they are le&s;&s;ened, becau&s;e others have their due.</P>
<P N="83">83. Such people generally have le&s;s merit than ambition, that covet the re|ward

of other men's; and, to be &s;ure, a very ill nature, that will rather rob others of their due, than allow them their prai&s;e.</P>
<P N="84">84. It is more an error of our will than our judgment: for we know it to be an effect of our pa&s;&s;ion, not our rea|&s;on; and therefore we are the more culpable in our partial e&s;timates.</P>
<P N="85">85. It is as envious as unju&s;t, to un|der-rate another's actions, where their intrin&s;ick worth recommends them to di&s;engaged minds.</P>
<P N="86">86. Nothing &s;hews more the folly, as well as fraud of man, than clipping merit and reputation.</P>
<P N="87">87. And as &s;ome men think it an alloy to them&s;elves, that others have their right; &s;o they know no end of pilfering, to rai&s;e their own credit.</P>
<P N="88">88. This envy is the child of pride; and mi&s;-gives rather than mi&s;-takes.</P>
<P N="89">89. It will have charity to be o&s;tenta|tion; &s;obriety, covetou&s;ne&s;s; humili|ty, craft; bounty, popularity. In &s;hort,
<PB N="125" REF="024663_0143_0FC81720FB13AC28">
virtue mu&s;t be de&s;ign, and religion on|ly intere&s;t. Nay, the be&s;t of qualities mu&s;t not pa&s;s without a but to alloy their merit, and abate their prai&s;e. Ba|&s;e&s;t of tempers! and they that have it, the wor&s;t of men.</P>
<P N="90">90. But ju&s;t and noble minds rejoice in other men's &s;ucce&s;s, and help to aug|ment their prai&s;e.</P>
<P N="91">91. And, indeed, they are not with|out a love to virtue, that take a &s;ati&s;|faction in &s;eeing her rewarded; and &s;uch de&s;erve to &s;hare her character, that do abhor to le&s;&s;en it.</P>

<P N="237">237. It is I, at every turn, that does this, or can do that. And as he abounds in his compari&s;ons, &s;o he is &s;ure to give him&s;elf the better of every body el&s;e; according to the proverb, "All his gee&s;e are &s;wans."</P>

<P N="242">242. This &s;illy di&s;po&s;ition comes of a mixture of ignorance, confidence, and pride: and as there is more or le&s;s of the la&s;t, &s;o it is more or le&s;s offen&s;ive, or entertaining.</P>
<P N="243">243. And yet, perhaps, the wor&s;t part of this vanity is its unteachablene&s;s. Tell it any thing, and it has known it long ago; and out-runs information and in&s;truction, or el&s;e proudly puffs at it.</P>
<P N="244">244. Whereas the greate&s;t under&s;tand|ings doubt mo&s;t, are readie&s;t to learn, and lea&s;t plea&s;ed with them&s;elves; this, with nobody el&s;e.</P>

<P N="258">258.

<P N="259">259. But is it not a mo&s;t unaccounta|ble folly, that men &s;hould be proud of the providences that &s;hould humble

them; or think the better of them&s;elves, in&s;tead of him that rai&s;ed them &s;o much above the level; or of being &s;o in their lives, in return of his extraordinary fa|vours?</P>
<P N="260">260. But it is but too near a-kin to us, to think no farther than our&s;elves, ei|ther in the acqui&s;ition, or u&s;e, of our wealth and greatne&s;s: when, alas! they are the preferments of heaven, to try our wi&s;dom, bounty, and gratitude.</P>
<P N="261">261. It is a dangerous perver&s;ion of the end of providence, to con&s;ume the time, power, and wealth, he has given us above other men, to gratify our &s;or|did pa&s;&s;ions, in&s;tead of playing the good &s;tewards, to the honor of our great benefactor, and the good of our fellow-creatures.</P>
<P N="262">262. But it is an inju&s;tice too; &s;ince tho&s;e higher ranks of men are but the tru&s;tees of heaven, for the benefit of le&s;&s;er mortals: who, as minors, are in|titled to all their care and provi&s;ion.</P>

For this cau&s;e, doubtle&s;s, it was that they were rai&s;ed above ne|ce&s;&s;ity, or any trouble to live, that they might have more time and abili|ty to care for others: and it is certain, where that u&s;e is not made of the bounties of providence, they are em|bezzled and wa&s;ted.</P>
<P N="265">265. It has often &s;truck me with a &s;erious reflection, when I have ob&s;erv|ed the great inequality of the world that one man &s;hould have &s;uch num|bers of his fellow-creatures to wait upon him, who have &s;ouls to be &s;aved as well as he; and this not for bu&s;i|ne&s;s, but &s;tate.

<P N="268">268. When the poor Indians hear us call any of our family by the name of &s;ervants, they cry out, 'What! call brethren &s;ervant! we call our dogs &s;ervants, but never men.'

<P N="286">286. Nor can we expect to be heard of God in our prayers, that turn the deaf ear to the petitions of the di&s;|tre&s;&s;ed among&s;t our fellow-creatures.</P>
<P N="287">287. God &s;ends the poor to try us: as well as he tries them by being &s;uch: and he that refu&s;es them a lit|tle, out of the great deal that God has given him, lays up poverty in &s;tore for his own po&s;terity.</P>

<P N="289">289. Next, charity makes the be&s;t con&s;truction of things and per&s;ons; and is &s;o far from being an evil &s;py, a back-biter, or a detractor, that it ex|cu&s;es weakne&s;s, extenuates mi&s;carri|ages, makes the be&s;t of every thing, forgives every body, &s;erves all, and hopes to the end.</P>

<P N="296">296. Wherefore a man can never be a true and good Chri&s;tian without cha|rity, even in the lowe&s;t &s;en&s;e of it;

and yet he may have that part thereof, and &s;till be none of the apo&s;tle's true Chri&s;tian: &s;ince he tells us, "That though we &s;hould give all our goods to the poor, and want charity (in her other and higher &s;en&s;es) it would pro|fit us nothing."</P>
