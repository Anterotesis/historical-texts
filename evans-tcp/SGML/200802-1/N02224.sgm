<P>There are many pretty Things in it; &s;everal right Notions and true Po&s;itions, which are not the le&s;s u&s;e|ful for being generally known.

<P>Prithee don't grin &s;o. <HI>Par&s;ons</HI> tell the People, <HI>They mu&s;t adhere to what they &s;ay, and not what they act.</HI> Some will inform us (a great Truth) <HI>That Rum and other Spirits impair the Heat of the Stomach, produce pining Di|&s;ea&s;es and lingring Deaths</HI>;&mdash; Com|plain, <HI>That the Generality of People are &s;o addicted to them, that neither Re|gard to publick Intere&s;t or private, Bo|dy or Soul, will divert them from the frequent U&s;e of it</HI>: And yet the&s;e very Dictators mi&s;s very few Days in the Week wherein they do not begin in the Morning with that ruinous new Invention of <HI>White Bitter</HI>; and com|pleat the Evening, which they would &s;eem to de&s;ign for chearful and impro|ving Conver&s;ation, in full Loads of the pernicious and intoxicating Compound.</P>

<P>What a &s;trange Creature art? To &s;train up a Character ju&s;t now too valuable for me, and then put me up|on &s;o oppo&s;ite a Part?

Winter, and wrought at Wages in Sum|mer; by which Means I had enough to &s;upport me, and provide Nece&s;&s;aries till I got a Hou&s;e and a Crop. I &s;oon got out of &s;ome &s;mall Debts, which this nece&s;&s;i|tated, and managed &s;o, as to be no more any thing con&s;iderably involved.</P>
<P>I never went to Markets, Fairs, or the Town, but when my Bu&s;ine&s;s called me, and was &s;uch as would compen&s;ate the Time and Charge. When there, I never &s;ate tipling the Day out, and then ride home in the Night to de&s;troy my Health, and unfit me for Bu&s;ine&s;s the next Day. My Wife (for I married the &s;econd Year of &s;ettling) was loving and indu&s;trious; She &s;pun &s;o much Linnen and Woollen as to be pretty well &s;tock'd before Encrea&s;e of young Children took her off. And by that Time, thro' the Ble&s;&s;ing of God on my Indu&s;try, I had got enough aforehand to afford her a Maid, and &s;oon after, my &s;elf a Man. Our Children grew, and help'd us on bravely, &s;o that I added to my Land a Piece to &s;ettle one Son, and began it, and have agreed for another, ha|ving wherewithal to pay for it.</P>
<P>I never gadded about, chaffering with, or for Hor&s;es. I ob&s;erved the Time &s;pent, and Charge of keeping them fine and high for Sale, did not an&s;wer even to the Jock|eys.
<PB N="29" REF="002652_0029_0FE59B97824DE3B8" MS="y">
I kept no more than were nece&s;&s;ary. But what I rai&s;ed and could &s;pare from Plantation-U&s;e, I di&s;po&s;ed of, as any Neigh|bour wanted, at moderate common Rates.</P>

I ob&s;erved and copy'd after the mo&s;t indu&s;trious and improving of my Neighbours, took all Opportunities of be|ing inqui&s;itive concerning their Mode of Management, and their Experience, and was as free in communicating mine.</P>
<P>I never burden'd my Neighbours with rambling or trining Vi&s;its, tho I loved to be &s;ociable, and we &s;aw one another of|ten, but contrived it &s;o, as not to be inju|rious to either of our Affairs by Lo&s;s of Time.

<P>Shrewd <HI>Jenny.</HI>&mdash; I think I may draw to a Conclu&s;ion, for I have a mind to clo&s;e with &s;omething general, if I can but expre&s;s what has &s;ometimes taken large Room in my &s;erious Thoughts, in Words few enough to be heard patiently.</P>
<P>I have indeed been &s;unk in my Spirits, and ready to weep at the melancholy Pro&s;|pect before us. The Hone&s;ty, Sobriety, Indu&s;try, religious Concern of Mind, and

Openne&s;s of Heart one towards another, which &s;o apparently and beautifully ac|companied, and were the Characteri&s;ticks of mo&s;t of our fir&s;t Settlers, &s;eem (too much of it) to be gone down to the Grave with them. At <HI>Fairs, Markets,</HI> Country-Vendues, and almo&s;t all Times of Con|cour&s;e, (and O that I could &s;ay tho&s;e in|tended as religious Services, and Vi&s;itati|ons of Charity and Love were wholly free!) How does Levity, Rudene&s;s, and the de|plorable Cu&s;tom of Exce&s;s in &s;pirituous and intoxicating Liquors prevail, and e&s;|pecially that of <HI>Dram, Dram,&mdash; Dram</HI> up|on <HI>Dram!

<P>Since the baneful Practice is become &s;o general, I perceive it is propo&s;ed the Go|vernment &s;hould take it in Hand.

But Happine&s;s, if we think rightly, con&s;i&s;ts in the Golden Mean, to be free from Straits and Penury, on the one Hand, and the Temptations to Luxury and its Crony-Vices on the other. This was a celebrated Prayer of old: And as we really exceed all the <HI>We&s;t-India</HI> Co|lonies, and mo&s;t of the other Plantations in all the whole&s;om nece&s;&s;ary and (in a ju|dicious Sen&s;e) delicate Provi&s;ion for Life, Health and manly Satisfactions; Prudence and good Judgment will account us hap|pily &s;ituated: But if we do not think and find it &s;o, the Fault is our own.</P>
<P>Let us take a View; let us not be blind to the great Ble&s;&s;ings we enjoy; a health|ful Climate, and productive Country; neither Soldier, nor mercinary Bands of any other Denomination, burden or injure us. The Natives, whom our Predece&s;&s;ors found in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, we have always liv'd peaceably with, and they love us.
