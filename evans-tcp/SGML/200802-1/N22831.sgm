<HEAD TYPE="sub">A FRAGMENT.</HEAD>
<P>TIRED with oppre&s;&s;ion in our native land, and in hopes of a better &s;ituation in America, two hundred of us, hale, hearty, and indu&s;trious, be&s;ides women and children, embarked at Londonderry, on board the ******, bound for Philadelphia.</P>

From the out&s;et untoward acci|dents awaited us. We had not been ten days at &s;ea, when our ve&s;&s;el &s;prung a leak, which, for a long time, baffled all our endeavours. At length, being di&s;covered, it was &s;topped, and we e&s;teemed our&s;elves &s;ecure.&mdash;Thougtle&s;s mortals! the di&s;appoint|ment of to-day never produces the effect of preparing us for the cala|mity of to-morrow!</P>
<P>A gu&s;t aro&s;e! the elements warred together, as if it were the "la&s;t groan of expiring nature." The floodgates of heaven &s;eemed loo&s;ed! dreadful peals of thunder rattled on the ear. The &s;toute&s;t hearts were appalled. The forked lightning

&s;truck our ma&s;t, and &s;et the ve&s;&s;el on fire. Be&s;et by two raging elements&mdash;the roaring billows, which la&s;hed her &s;ides, and &s;eemed ready to &s;wallow her and us, though they had appeared &s;o terrific before&mdash;now lo&s;t their hor|rors, and were regarded&mdash;melancholy alternative!&mdash;as a le&s;s tremendous enemy than their new auxiliary.</P>
<P>With va&s;t difficulty, the flame was extingui&s;hed&mdash;but not until it had rendered our ve&s;&s;el &s;carcely manage|able. To complete the mea&s;ure of our woes, our provi&s;ions fell &s;hort. A bi&s;cuit and a pint of water, fetid and almo&s;t as den&s;e as glue, was the daily portion of each! Every morning &s;aw two or three mi&s;erable wretches

heaved overboard, into a watry grave, in the pre&s;ence of their dejected friends and relatives, each hourly ex|pecting the hand of death to clo&s;e his eyes, and free him from his aby&s;s of mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>"Father! father!" cries a once beautiful, but now emaciated child, who&s;e vi&s;age bore irre&s;i&s;tible evidence of near-approaching mortality, <Q>get me a drink! I faint&mdash;I die!&mdash;for God's &s;ake let me have a drop of water to quench my thir&s;t!</Q></P>
<P><Q>Captain, I beg a little water to &s;ave my child from death,</Q>&mdash;<Q>You have had your &s;hare for to-day, and &s;hall have no more.</Q></P>

<Q>Brute! &s;tranger to the tender feel|ings of nature&mdash;had you a child&mdash;but you are not worthy of having one&mdash;you would pity my pre&s;ent &s;ituation, and relieve me.</Q></P>
<P>The mother of the child, who had &s;wooned away, ju&s;t came to her&s;elf. She heard his plaintive cries. She joined her voice to his, and be&s;ought the father to procure the water.</P>
<P>Melancholy, angui&s;h, and torture, &s;eized the tender hu&s;band's&mdash;the ten|der father's &s;oul. The big tear rolled down his cheek. <Q>Gracious and all|powerful God! why vi&s;it your children with &s;uch calamities?

<P>He returned to the &s;cene he had ju&s;t quitted. His beloved child lay breathing his la&s;t. His wife had &s;wooned away again. The &s;ight was too afflictive. His agonies over|powered him. He went to the captain, whom he quarrelled with, &s;truck. The blows were returned. He &s;eized a &s;word; and the captain, ru&s;hing for|ward, received it in his brea&s;t. He clo&s;ed his eyes for ever.</P>
<P>Di&s;order and confu&s;ion en&s;ued in the ve&s;&s;el. The &s;ailors plundered every thing they could lay their hands upon: and &s;uch was their irregularity

and carele&s;&s;ne&s;s, that they ran the ve&s;|&s;el aground at Synapuxent, in the &s;tate of Maryland.</P>
<P>The &s;ea ran mountains high. A &s;kiff, with about twenty per&s;ons on board, was over&s;et by an enormous wave. The &s;hrieks and piteous cries of men, women, and children, &s;oon died away. They were &s;wallowed up in one common grave. Mo&s;t of the remainder were drowned in endea|vouring to &s;wim to land.</P>
<P>About thirty mi&s;erable wretches of us, gained the &s;hore, &s;ome fortunate enough to &s;ave their property. We expected there to meet with relief and comfort. Fatal delu&s;ion! Had we been thrown a&s;hore among the New

<P>Man! man! wretched, infatuated man!

<Q>'To catch the living manners as they ri&s;e.'</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>EVERY writer, who has follow|ed the career of the great Addi&s;on, has begun his numbers with a de&s;crip|tion of him&s;elf, his views, &s;ituation, &amp;c. in order, at the commencement of the journey, to ingratiate him&s;elf into the favour of his fellow travellers.
<PB N="15" REF="030158_0013_0FE3FAC7B89F6838">
From this cu&s;tom it would be con&s;i|dered equally improper to depart, as for a clergyman to begin a &s;ermon without taking a text. To &s;hew my re&s;pect, therefore, for the reader of my lucubrations, I &s;hall give a pro|logue to the entertainment I am about to provide for him.</P>
<P>I am of a very ancient family, and have the honour to have &s;ome of the <HI>inca</HI> blood in my veins&mdash;being de&s;|cended from the unfrotunate Atabali|ba, who &s;o mi&s;erably peri&s;hed through the avarice and ignorance of Pizarro. By the female line I boa&s;t of an ance&s;|tor, the great Owen Roe O'Nial, the a&s;&s;erter of Iri&s;h liberty. My great grandfather, by the mother's &s;ide,
<PB N="16" REF="030158_0014_0FE3FACACF5A8EA8">
came over to this country with the divine Penn, who&s;e humane and tole|rant &s;pirit laid the foundation of &s;o much happine&s;s for the people of his province.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the grandeur of my parentage, I drew my fir&s;t breath in a &s;mall cottage at the foot of the Alle|ghany mountain. There, free as air, I imbibed from my early age all the ardour and patrioti&s;m of &s;pirit u&s;ually generated by independence: for it is but too true, that
<Q><L><HI>Haud facile emergunt, quorum vir tutibus ob&s;tat</HI></L>
<L><HI>Res angu&s;ta domi.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="030158_0015_0FE3FAD067FE24D8">
With a few books, but tho&s;e judici|ou&s;ly cho&s;en by a watchful parent, I acquired a &s;en&s;e of the "Dignity of "human nature." I &s;aw, with reli|gious gratitude and reverence, the va&s;t and unparalleled advantages of our we&s;tern hemi&s;phere. I learned to de&s;pi&s;e the &s;opperies, the follies, and the pretended refinements of the old world. I enjoyed, with rapture, the boundle&s;s pro&s;pects of happine&s;s and virtue, de&s;tined, as I hoped, for re|mote po&s;terity, in these exten&s;ive regions.</P>
<P>From Alleghany's foot I removed to the metropolis of America, as Phi|ladelphia proudly vaunts her&s;elf. I here ob&s;erved manners prevailing,
<PB N="18" REF="030158_0016_0FE3FAD3C673F270">
which, when I had read of them, as European, I had de&s;pi&s;ed. I &s;aw a few, who&s;e example mu&s;t have a pow|erful influence, giving a taint to the general ma&s;s, and appearing anxious in endeavouring to accelerate the arrival of that degeneracy, which the patriot endeavours to delay as far as po&s;&s;ible. The&s;e <HI>ob&s;ervations,</HI> it may be rea&s;ona|bly pre&s;umed, gave me pain. I dread|ed that the a&s;ylum, &s;o much boa&s;ted of, would be de&s;troyed&mdash;and that from a &s;preading depravity, the &s;tate of America, the revolution of which <Q>had revived the hopes of good men, and promi&s;ed an opening to better times, would become a di&s;courage|ment to future efforts in favour of
<PB N="19" REF="030158_0017_0FE3FAD976216048">
liberty, and prove only an opening to a new &s;cene of human degeneracy and mi&s;ery.</Q></P>
<P>And is there, thought I, no per&s;on to &s;tep forward, and endeavour to &s;tem the torrent that is gradually &s;apping the foundation of morals and manners, and which, if &s;uffered to proceed un|interruptedly, will bear down every things valuable in its progre&s;s?</P>
<P>As I have ever conceived, that even the attempt to accompli&s;h great objects is laudable, I cho&s;e rather to expo&s;e my own weakne&s;s, than be wanting to the public intere&s;t. I de|termined to communicate to my fel|low citizens the <HI>ob&s;ervations</HI> I might occa&s;ionally make, in hopes of being
<PB N="20" REF="030158_0018_0FE3FADC38001710">
&s;erviceable to the cau&s;e of virtue, Happy, too happy &s;hall I be, if I be|come the humble in&s;trument of &s;ham|ing out of countenance any &s;ingle one of the follies or vices, which are &s;o carefully tran&s;planted from their native &s;oil, and which, like other ill weeds, flouri&s;h apace, and threaten to choke up the valuable plants.</P>
<P>Con&s;cious of my inability, una&s;&s;i&s;t|ed, to accompli&s;h, to the extent I de|&s;ire, the grand object I have in view, I have enli&s;ted into the &s;ervice a few aids de camp who will occa&s;ionally furni&s;h their &s;peculations. Hence will ari&s;e an agreeable diver&s;ity of &s;tile and &s;entiment&mdash;and that &s;amene&s;s, &s;o lia|ble

<P>I invite every man, who is de&s;irous to advance the be&s;t intere&s;ts of &s;ociety, to co-operate in this undertaking.&mdash;Per&s;onality and &s;currility I de&s;pi&s;e, and &s;hall avoid. But general &s;atire however &s;evere, if calculated to an|&s;wer good purpo&s;es, &s;hall be always acceptable.</P>
<P>So many times have periodical e&s;&s;ayi&s;ts a&s;&s;umed the pen, and &s;o great is the &s;amene&s;s of their &s;ubjects of di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, that mo&s;t of them are nearly exhau&s;ted:&mdash;and therefore much no|velty is hardly to be expected. Ter|ence

<P>THE <HI>liberality</HI> of manners and cu&s;toms, daily introducing into our country, mu&s;t afford the highe&s;t grati|fication to every lover of elegance and <HI>refinement.</HI> We are as repidly as hap|pily di&s;&s;ipating the <HI>ru&s;t</HI> and <HI>prejudices</HI> of pa&s;t times, and, with a &s;pirit of emulation beyond our years, copying
<PB N="24" REF="030158_0022_0FE3FAF389DCF2B8">
the <HI>graces</HI> and <HI>virtues</HI> of England, France, and Italy. To particularize every in&s;tance, in which we excel our ance&s;tors, would require more time and room than I can now devote to the purpo&s;e&mdash;indeed, it would be be|yond my abilities, to do ju&s;tice to &s;o capacious a &s;ubject. I &s;hall, there|fore, for the pre&s;ent, confine my&s;elf to one leading feature in modern man|ners, wherein their &s;uperiority to tho&s;e of old times is too obvious not to com|mand the a&s;&s;ent of the mo&s;t &s;uperficial ob&s;erver.</P>
<P>The feature I mean, is the relaxa|tion of the <HI>odious re&s;traints</HI> &s;o ex|tremely di&s;agreeable in the married &s;tate. Hereto&s;ore, when a man or
<PB N="25" REF="030158_0023_0FE3FAED97875C78">
woman made choice of a partner for life, that partner was con&s;idered as entitled to the chief of his or her cares and attentions. Any breach of this rule was <HI>ridiculou&s;ly</HI> regarded as a violation of the laws of decorum and propriety, which entailed di&s;credit on the offending party. The hu&s;band gallanted his wife, to the theatre, to balls, to a&s;&s;emblies, to concerts, and to private parties. The <HI>in&s;ipid mono|tony</HI> of &s;uch a life mu&s;t be to the la&s;t degree irk&s;ome and di&s;gu&s;ting; as one of the highe&s;t gratifications of human nature is variety.</P>
<P>Behold! what a charming contra&s;t is exhibited at pre&s;ent! In the fa&s;hiona|ble world&mdash;(and mu&s;t we not expect,
<PB N="26" REF="030158_0024_0FE3FAF65A13FAC8">
that this refinement will, in due &s;ea|&s;on, like every other, de&s;cend to the lower cla&s;&s;es?)&mdash;a man is pro&s;cribed from attendiing on his wife, or appear|ing in public with her. He may gra|tify his pa&s;&s;ion for variety by taking a new lady under his protection every day of his life. How ineffably agreea|ble, how delightful a change!</P>
<P>This will introduce, among its other advantages, an unu&s;ual degree of <HI>harmony</HI> in the married &s;tate. The chief cau&s;e, if we believe the writer of that <HI>moral</HI> and <HI>edi&s;ying</HI> comedy, the <HI>&s;chool for &s;candal,</HI> why ladies are &s;o <HI>refractory</HI> and unmanageable with their hu&s;bands, is the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing&mdash;what? why that <HI>ridicu|lous
<PB N="27" REF="030158_0025_0FE3FAFBEF4355B0">
old fa&s;hioned</HI> quality, called cha&s;|tity&mdash;a quality, which, however &s;uita|ble to the days of <HI>ignorance</HI> and <HI>bar|bari&s;m,</HI> on the fir&s;t &s;ettlement of this country, ought to be <HI>entirely laughed out of countenance</HI> at pre&s;ent. Every thing, therefore, that has a tendency to extirpate this trouble&s;ome quality, mu&s;t be productive of peace and har|mony. And I believe no man in his &s;en&s;es will deny, that the improve|ment in que&s;tion will have the happi|e&s;t tendency that could be wi&s;hed, to bani&s;h cha&s;tity and all her <HI>trouble&s;ome retinue</HI> from our &s;hores. Perhaps, they may fly for refuge among the Creek Indians, to the court of the pui&s;&s;ant prince, Alexander M'Gil|livray.
<PB N="28" REF="030158_0026_0FE3FAFF06F1B1D8">
Such antiquated beings are fit only for the uncultivated &s;avages&mdash;they ought not to di&s;grace &s;uch an advanced &s;tate of civilization as we can boa&s;t.</P>
<P>"When a lady," &s;ays Mr. Sheri|dan, the author of that <HI>valuable come|dy</HI> I have already mentioned, "com|mits a TRIFLING <HI>faux pas,</HI> &s;he grows cautious, and ready to <HI>humour</HI> and <HI>agree</HI> with her hu&s;band.'<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">School for Scandal&mdash;page 40, American edition.</NOTE>This <HI>excel|lent</HI> and <HI>religious</HI> maxim, which I hope no per&s;on will controvert, e&s;tab|li&s;hes beyond a doubt my po&s;ition, that this new mode will be productive of matrimonial concord.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="030158_0027_0FE3FB04CDBE0D18">
Another of the benefits of this ex|pan&s;ion of the human mind, is the catholici&s;m it will introduce with re&s;|pect to <HI>children.</HI> As a hu&s;band will not in future have the &s;ame degree of certainty, that his wife's children be|long <HI>properly &s;peaking,</HI> to him&s;elf, he will be no longer &s;o <HI>contemptibly</HI> and <HI>illiberally</HI> contracted in his regards and cares of them, as parents u&s;ed to be, in times of <HI>prejudice.</HI> Moreover, it is to be hoped and expected, that he will confer the <HI>&s;ame favours</HI> on his neighbours, as they on him. Hence, a <HI>community of children</HI> will be intro|duced among us, in a much more agreeable way, than that attempted in one of the old republics. How
<PB N="30" REF="030158_0028_0FE3FB082201B040">
charming, then, will it be, that a man may point out <HI>likene&s;&s;es of him&s;elf</HI> in the hou&s;es of almo&s;t all his ac|quaintance! The political good ten|dency of this is equal to its beneficial moral effects.</P>
<P>Among the French, that nation of gallantry and refinement, the <HI>&s;tiff &s;tarched</HI> manners that have hitherto prevailed in this country, have been long exploded. A lady's bed-charm|ber, which here has been too gene|rally con&s;idered as her <HI>&s;anctum &s;ancto|rum,</HI> impervious to every one but the <HI>privileged hu&s;band,</HI> there yields to the &s;uperior influence of fa&s;hion and gal|lantry.

ri&s;es, and choo&s;es it as the mo&s;t pro|per place for making enquiries after her health. As the ladies univer&s;ally paint there, perhaps this fa&s;hion was introduced in order to give the gentle|men an opportunity of <HI>&s;eeing,</HI> before the application of the colours, what could not be &s;een afterwards&mdash;that is, the ladies' faces in their natural &s;tate.

<P>The next &s;tep we have to take&mdash;and which will naturally follow&mdash;is the introduction of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">ce&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">ei&s;m</HI> from the Italians. I have been much &s;urpri&s;ed that the French, who have always paid &s;uch particular attention to the refinement of morals and manners, have never borrowed this <HI>admirable</HI> cu&s;tom from their tran&s;alpine neigh|bours. This is the more &s;ingular, as
<PB N="33" REF="030158_0031_0FE3FB167899BF00">
it is materially connected with, and &s;eems a nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence of, the leading features of their matrimonial &s;y&s;tem. This is one proof, among thou&s;ands that might be produced, of nations in a progre&s;&s;ive &s;tate of im|provement, &s;topping &s;hort, before they arived at the <HI>acme of perfection.</HI> But I hope our moral and political career will not be thus di&s;gracefully marked. I tru&s;t, as we receive here the hardy German, the vivacious Ita|lan, the volatile Frenchman, the grave Engli&s;hman, the ho&s;pitable Iri&s;hman, and the indu&s;trious Scotch|man; that we &s;hall cull from the man|ners of the&s;e various nations, and
<PB N="34" REF="030158_0032_0FE3FB18921A9CF0">
form one national &s;y&s;tem &s;uperior to that of any of them.</P>
<P>Con&s;i&s;tently with this idea, from England we &s;hall borrow the mode of <HI>facilitating divorces,</HI> from which the French and Italians are in &s;ome de|gree precluded, by a tenet of their re|ligion, which prohibits a &s;econd mar|riage, until the death of one of the parties. But our mother country (mother let her be, in dictating our manners, as well as in having &s;ettled the continent) has rendered &s;epara|tion in the fa&s;hionable world as ea&s;y as could rea&s;onably be de&s;ired. Thus, for in&s;tance, when a married pair be|come tired of each other, and the lady has cho&s;en, among her <HI>male friends,</HI> a
<PB N="35" REF="030158_0033_0FE3FB1EA2FC0248">
future help-mate, with who&s;e <HI>talents</HI> &s;he is well acquainted, the three agree, that the wife and her gallant &s;hall be found in &s;uch a &s;ituation, as to warrant a <HI>&s;uit for divorce;</HI> which is immediately commenced&mdash;the parties are &s;eparated&mdash;and the lady trium|phantly led to the altar by her para|mour.</P>
<P>This is, in my humble opinion, the <HI>ne plus ultra</HI> of improvement in this way. Any attempts to change the &s;y&s;tem henceforward, mu&s;t proceed in a retrogade direction. I am lo&s;t in a&s;toni&s;hment and admiration at this important &s;ecret, re&s;erved for this age of di&s;covery. What ine&s;timable con|&s;equences it mu&s;t have, in a <HI>political

moral,</HI> and <HI>religious</HI> point of view, is very evident to even a Baeotian capa|city.</P>
<P>One of the good effects of the mo|dern &s;y&s;tem, which had almo&s;t e&s;ca|ped my notice, is the encouragement it will afford to the <HI>honourable</HI> and <HI>u&s;eful</HI> &s;tate of <HI>celibacy,</HI> which has &s;o often mi&s;takenly been the object of legi&s;lative vengeance, among nations of <HI>contracted</HI> manners.

Maria Arnold was the daughter of a re&s;pectable merchant at Hartford, in Connecticut, and was, by bounteous providence, endowed with every ac|compli&s;hment of head and heart, that could qualify her to act in the mo&s;t exalted &s;tation. When arrived at &s;ixteen years of age, her hand was &s;ought after by numbers of the fir&s;t rate characters in the city. Among the re&s;t was Mr. Henry Winthrop, an eminent merchant, who&s;e congeni|ality of di&s;po&s;ition &s;oon acquired her e&s;teem and regard. After an ac|quaintance of a year, &s;he received him on the footing of a lover; and in &s;ome months afterwards, they were
<PB N="42" REF="030158_0040_0FE4B154C8FC7210">
happily united together, at the hyme|neal altar.</P>
<P>Become the wife of Mr. Winthrop, her virtues had a more exten&s;ive &s;phere of action&mdash;and expanded into the warme&s;t affection for her hu&s;band&mdash;tenderne&s;s for her children (of whom &s;he pre&s;ented one to her hu&s;|band every thirteen or fourteen months)&mdash;charity and regard for her dome&s;tics&mdash;benevolence and friend|&s;hip for the circle of her acquaint|ance.</P>
<P>When &s;he was in her twenty|&s;eventh year, the happy mother of &s;ix children, e&s;teemed and re&s;pected by all who knew her&mdash;beloved by her hu&s;band and children, the late war
<PB N="43" REF="030158_0041_0FE4B1565CF59AD0">
broke out by the fatal engagement at Lexington. Mr. Winthrop, attached to the Briti&s;h government, and accu&s;|tomed to look up to Great Britain with awe and reverence, could not reli&s;h the idea of re&s;i&s;ting her power, which he regarded as a political &s;acri|lege. He determined to make &s;ale of his property, and retire to England. This de&s;ign he &s;peedily carried into execution&mdash;and arrived there early in the year 1777.</P>
<P>Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of an immen&s;e fortune&mdash;fond of high life&mdash;and allured by the attractions of the fa&s;hionable world, he commenced a career of gaiety and di&s;&s;ipation. The mutual attachment between him and his wife, which had
<PB N="44" REF="030158_0042_0FE4B158E1843B10">
&s;ub&s;i&s;ted uninterruptedly, and had indeed acquired new force every year of their connection, while they re|mained in this country, was gradually weakened by the cour&s;e of life they led in London. On his arrival, he paid the &s;ame kind of attention to his beloved partner, that he had been accu&s;tomed to. But he was told that it was a mere bore for a married man to gallant his wife&mdash;that he would be con&s;idered as a mo&s;t unfa&s;hionable mon&s;ter, &s;hould he be &s;een in her com|pany in public&mdash;and that any appear|ance of fondne&s;s for her, if di&s;cover|ed, would &s;ubject him to the &s;neers and &s;corn of his acquaintance.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="030158_0043_0FE4B15B654DCA18">
The&s;e le&s;&s;ons he found it very dif|ficult to dige&s;t. His ardent love could not brook &s;uch di&s;gui&s;e and di&s;|&s;imulation. For a long time, there|fore, he remained unfa&s;hionable in this particular, and in &s;ometimes bringing his children into company. But as ince&s;&s;ant exhortations and in|ce&s;&s;ant ridicule will turn almo&s;t any mortal from a purpo&s;e, however fixed; he at length gave way to fa&s;hion, and as cautiou&s;ly avoided his wife's com|pany in public, as he would the &s;ociety of one of the furies.</P>
<P>Among the gentlemen who be&s;tow|ed their cares and attentions on Mrs. Winthrop, who&s;e beauty &s;hone with mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed lu&s;tre, was Sir Jo&s;eph
<PB N="46" REF="030158_0044_0FE4B15FA5DDA638">
Middleton, a man who&s;e &s;ole rule of conduct was the refined &s;ubtle &s;y&s;tem of Che&s;terfield. He had, on the plan of his ma&s;ter, &s;acrificed largely to the graces; and his &s;acrifices had not been in vain. To the attractions of a fine per&s;on, and enchanting addre&s;s, he added a mo&s;t refined and highly cultivated under&s;tanding. He had travelled&mdash;and engrafted the mo&s;t elegant of the manners of France and Italy on tho&s;e of England. Had not his heart been depraved by the &s;educ|tions of fa&s;hion, he would have been an incomparable character. But into mo&s;t of the vices of the times he en|tered&mdash;more, however, from a deter|mination
<PB N="47" REF="030158_0045_0FE4B1612F07DF08">
to be a fa&s;hionable man, than from the impul&s;e of inclination.</P>
<P>From the moment that Sir Jo&s;eph &s;ingled out Mrs. Winthrop as the object of his gallantry, &s;he rejected the re&s;t of the &s;urrounding crowd. To Vaux|hall, to plays, to a&s;&s;emblies, to court, he daily led her, and, before many months had elap&s;ed, almo&s;t entirely eradicated from her mind every trace of love or affection for her hu&s;band.</P>
<P>still was &s;he virtuous even in thought. She did not know, or allow her&s;elf to believe, the hold Sir Jo&s;eph daily gained on her affections. He &s;aw clearly, that to proceed with any hopes of &s;ucce&s;s, it would be nece&s;&s;ary to proceed with caution. Had he, in
<PB N="48" REF="030158_0046_0FE4B163E163A738">
an early &s;tage of their acquaintance, even hinted at his real intentions, &s;he would have &s;purned him from her with the mo&s;t profound di&s;dain and contempt. But this he carefully avoi|ded, until he was fully a&s;&s;ured of his conque&s;t. When this was the ca&s;e, he only lay in wait for an opportunity to perpetrate his black de&s;igns.</P>
<P>And here, Mr. Ob&s;erver, allow me to pau&s;e for a moment, and recal your attention to the former &s;ituation of this lovely but falling angel. When po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of virtue, &s;he would have been an ornament to a throne&mdash;for as the poet ju&s;tly ob&s;erves,

<L>And fortune &s;ets them in the &s;tronge&s;t light&mdash;</L>
<L>'Tis all below of heaven we may view,</L>
<L>And all but adoration is their due.</L></Q></P>
<P>But now her mind is in part depra|ved&mdash;the remainder of Sir Jo&s;eph's vile triumph will co&s;t him little trou|ble.</P>
<P>One night at a ma&s;querade ball, he artfully prevailed on her to drink pret|ty freely of an intoxicating cordial, which, aided by the heat and inflam|mation of her blood, occa&s;ioned by
<PB N="50" REF="030158_0048_0FE4B16A845279D0">
dancing, &s;oon a&s;cended her head, and deprived her of her faculties. On her return homewards, he gave the coach|man directions to &s;top at the hou&s;e of an infamous mini&s;ter of his plea&s;ures. Here, taking advantage of her helple&s;s &s;ituation, and vowing eternal love and &s;ecrecy, he robbed her of that ine&s;ti|mable jewel, which no tears, no repen|tance can ever re&s;tore to lo&s;t, undone woman.</P>
<P>Sunk now into the depths of infa|my, &s;he felt, for a time, the keene&s;t remor&s;e for the crime &s;he had been guilty of. But Sir Jo&s;eph took too much pains, not to remove her anxi|ety. Frequent repetitions rendered her &s;o callous and unconcerned, that
<PB N="51" REF="030158_0049_0FE4B16C0CB68828">
her guilt &s;oon became public, and at length reached Mr. Winthrop's ears. This rou&s;ed him from the lethargy into which his blind pur&s;uit of a pre|po&s;terous fa&s;hion had thrown him. By the agency of a tru&s;ty &s;ervant, he gained information of an a&s;&s;ignation between them. He went to the place, and was on the point of &s;urpri|&s;ing them, but, notwith&s;tanding all his vigilance, a confidante of his wife's gave her notice of his approach, &s;o early as ju&s;t to allow Sir Jo&s;eph time to e&s;cape by a back window. However, he left behind him his hat and part of his clothes, which afford|ed &s;ufficient proofs of his villainy, and of the guilt of Mrs. Winthrop.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="030158_0050_0FE4B16F859D8000">
The injured hu&s;band, in the fir&s;t moments of his rage, was on the point of &s;acrificing her to his ju&s;t re&s;entment. But an in&s;tant's reflection made him determine not to imbrue his hands in female blood. He re&s;olved to take vengeance of the adulterer&mdash;and next morning &s;ent him a challenge, which was accepted. They met. They fought. Mr. Winthrop received a mortal wound&mdash;and expired, expre&s;&s;|ing his &s;orrow at having launched into &s;uch a &s;cene of di&s;&s;ipation, which had de&s;troyed his happine&s;s&mdash;bla&s;ted his wife's reputation irretrievably&mdash;and hurried him&s;elf into an untimely grave.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="030158_0051_0FE4B1710D844808">
This dreadful cata&s;trophe nearly brought her to a &s;en&s;e of her infamy.&mdash;She ca&s;t a retro&s;pective eye on the &s;cenes which &s;he had pa&s;&s;ed through&mdash;&s;he bewailed the deplorable gulph in which &s;he was &s;wallowed up&mdash;and made many &s;trong re&s;olutions of reformation, which, for a &s;hort time, &s;he endeavoured to carry into effect.

<HEAD>[From the Columbian Magazine, Sept. 1786.] SKETCH of the Life of the late NATHA|NIEL GREENE, Major General of the Forces of the United States of America.</HEAD>
<P>THIS gallant officer, who&s;e death is &s;o generally and &s;o ju&s;tly regretted, was born in the town of Warwick, Kent county, Rhode-I&s;land, in or about the year 1741, and was the &s;econd &s;on of a re&s;pectable citizen of the &s;ame name, (de&s;cended from one of the fir&s;t &s;ettlers of the colony) who was exten&s;ively concerned in lucrative iron-works, the property of which, at his death, (prior to the war) he left to his children.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="030158_0067_0FE4B19DE6E5B3E0">
The General was endowed with an uncommon degree of judgment and penetration, which, with a benevolent manner and a&s;&s;able behaviour, acquired him a number of valuable friends, by who&s;e intere&s;t and influence, he was, at an early period of life, cho&s;en a member of the a&s;&s;embly of the then colony of Rhode-I&s;land. This tru&s;t, in which he gave the highe&s;t &s;atisfac|tion to his con&s;tituents, he continued to po&s;&s;e&s;s, until, and at, the period, when the folly and madne&s;s of Eng|land &s;evered a world from her em|pire.</P>
<P>After the &s;kirmi&s;hes at Lexington and Concord, when a &s;pirit of re&s;i&s;t|ance &s;pread, like wild-fire, over the
<PB N="70" REF="030158_0068_0FE4B1A146F1ADF0">
continent, Rhode-i&s;land was not defi|cient in her contributions for the gene|ral defence. She rai&s;ed three regiments of militia, the command whereof was given to Mr. Greene, who was nomi|nated brigadier-general. The liberty, &s;afety, and pro&s;perity of his country being expo&s;ed to imminent danger, the pacific principles of quakeri&s;m, in which he had been educated, proved in&s;ufficient to repre&s;s the ardent &s;pirit of liberty with which his bo&s;om glowed.</P>
<P>He led the troops under his com|mand to Cambridge, and was pre&s;ent at the evacuation of Bo&s;ton by a force which, in England had been vaunt|ingly &s;tated as treble the number that
<PB N="71" REF="030158_0069_0FE4B1A2D003C6F8">
would be requi&s;ite to dragoon America into unconditional &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>General Greene's merit and abili|ties, as well in the council as in the field, were not long unnoticed by gene|ral Wa&s;hington, who repo&s;ed in him the utmo&s;t confidence, and paid a par|ticular deference to his advice and opinion, on all occa&s;ions of doubt and difficulty. This excited the jealou&s;y of &s;everal officers, of older date and higher rank, who were not wanting in endeavours to &s;upplant him: but in vain&mdash;the commander in chief knew and prized his worth as it de&s;erved.</P>
<P>He was appointed major-general by congre&s;s, the 26th of Augu&s;t, 1776. Towards the clo&s;e of that year, he
<PB N="72" REF="030158_0070_0FE4B1A550392320">
was at the Trenton &s;uprize; and, at the beginning of the next, was at the bat|tle of Princeton, two enterprizes not more happily planned than judiciou&s;ly and bravely executed, in both of which he di&s;played his talents, &s;erv|ing his noviciate under the American Fabius.</P>
<P>At the battle of Brandywine, gene|ral Greene di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf by &s;upporting the right wing of the Ame|rican army, when it gave way, and judiciou&s;ly covering the whole, when routed and retreating in confu&s;ion; and their &s;afety from utter ruin was gen|nerally a&s;cribed to his &s;kill and exer|tions, which were well &s;econded by the troops under his command.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="030158_0071_0FE4B1A7D1280760">
At the battle of Germantown, he commanded the left wing of the Ame|rican army&mdash;and his utmo&s;t endea|vours were exerted to retreive the fortune of that day, in which his con|duct met with the approbation of the commander in chief.</P>
<P>In March, 1778, he was appoint|ed quarter-ma&s;ter general, which office he accepted under a &s;tipulation that his rank in the army &s;hould not be af|fected by it, and that he &s;hould retain his right to command in time of action, according to his rank and &s;eniority.</P>
<P>In this &s;tation, he fully an&s;wered the expectations formed of his abilities; and enabled the American army to
<PB N="74" REF="030158_0072_0FE4B1AC13993640">
move with additional celerity and vigour.</P>
<P>At the battle of Monmouth, the commander in chief, di&s;gu&s;ted with the behaviour of general Lee, depo&s;ed him in the field of battle, and appoint|ed general Greene to command the right wing, where he greatly contribu|ted to retrieve the errors of his prede|ce&s;&s;or, and to the &s;ub&s;equent event of the day.</P>
<P>About the middle of the year 1778, an attack being planned by the Ame|ricans, in conjunction with the French fleet, on the Briti&s;h garri&s;on at New|port, Rhode-i&s;land, general Sullivan was appointed to the command, under whom general Greene &s;erved. This
<PB N="75" REF="030158_0073_0FE4B1ADD5B3F438">
attempt was un&s;ucce&s;sful. The French fleet having failed out of harbour, to engage lord Howe's fleet, they were di&s;per&s;ed by a &s;torm, and the Ameri|cans were obliged to rai&s;e the &s;iege of Newport; in doing which general Greene di&s;played a great degree of &s;kill in drawing off the army in &s;afety.</P>
<P>After the hopes of the Briti&s;h gene|rals to execute &s;ome deci&s;ive &s;troke to the northward, were fru&s;trated, they turned their attention to the &s;outhern &s;tates, as le&s;s capable of de|fence, and more likely to reward the invaders with ample plunder. A grand expedition was, in con&s;equence, plan|ned at New-York, where the army embarked on the 26th of December,
<PB N="76" REF="030158_0074_0FE4B1B056AB5840">
1779, and landed on the 11th of February, 1780, within about thirty miles of Charle&s;ton, which, after a brave defence, was &s;urrendered to Sir Henry Clinton, on the 12th of May.</P>
<P>A &s;eries of ill &s;ucce&s;s followed this unfortunate event. The American arms in South Carolina were in gene|ral un&s;ucce&s;ful, and the inhabitants were obliged to &s;ubmit to the invaders, who&s;e impolitic &s;everity was extremely ill calculated to an&s;wer any of the ob|jects for which the war had been com|menced.</P>
<P>Affairs were thus cicurm&s;tanced, when general Wa&s;hington appointed general Greene to the command of
<PB N="77" REF="030158_0075_0FE4B1B3D36BAE00">
the American forces in the &s;outhern di&s;trict. He arrived at Charlotte, on the &s;econd day of December, 1780, accompained by gen. Morgan, a brave officer, who had di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf to the northward, in the expedition again&s;t Burgoyne. He found the forces he was to command, reduced to a very &s;mall number, by defeat and by de&s;ertion. The returns were nine hundred and &s;eventy continentals, and one thou&s;and and thirteen militia. Mi|litary &s;tores, provi&s;ions, forage, and all things nece&s;&s;ary, were, if po&s;&s;ible, in a more reduced &s;tate than his army. His men were without pay, and al|mo&s;t without clothing; and &s;upplies of the latter were not to be had but from
<PB N="78" REF="030158_0076_0FE4B1B6CE2C1128">
a di&s;tance of two hundred miles. In this perilous and embarra&s;&s;ed &s;ituation, he had to oppo&s;e a re&s;pectable and vic|torious army. Fortunately for him, the conduct of &s;ome of the friends of royalty obliged numbers, otherwi&s;e di&s;po&s;ed to remain neuter, to take up arms in their own defence. This and the prudent mea&s;ures the general took for removing the innumerable difficul|ties and di&s;advantages he was &s;urround|ed with, and for conciliating the affec|tions of the inhabitants, &s;oon brought together a con&s;iderable force, far infe|erior, however, to that of the Briti&s;h, who e&s;teemed the country perfectly &s;ubjugated.</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="030158_0077_0FE4B1B8588C7838">
After he had recruited his forces, with all the friends to the revolu|tion that he could a&s;&s;emble, he &s;ent a con&s;iderable detachment, under gene|ral Morgan, to the we&s;tern extremi|ties of the &s;tate, to protect the well di&s;po&s;ed inhabitants from the ravages of the tories. This force, which was the fir&s;t that had for a con&s;iderable time appeared there, on the &s;ide of the Americans, in&s;pired the friends of liberty with new courage, &s;o that numbers of them crowded to the &s;tandard of general Morgan. He at length became &s;o formidable, that lord Cornwallis thought proper to &s;end colonel Tarleton to di&s;lodge him from the &s;tation he had taken.
<PB N="80" REF="030158_0078_0FE4B1BADC9DBEA0">
This officer was at the head of a thou|&s;and regular troops, and had two field pieces. He came up, on the 17th of January, 1781, at a place called Cow|pens, with general Morgan, who&s;e force was much inferior, and was compo&s;ed of two-thirds militia, and one-third continentals. An engage|ment was the immediate con&s;equence.</P>
<P>The brevity of this &s;ketch will not permit me to go into a detail of the di&s;po&s;itions made on either &s;ide. Let it &s;uffice to &s;ay, that the brave Mor|gan gained a complete victory over an officer, the rapidity and &s;ucce&s;s of who&s;e attacks, until that time, might have entitled him to make u&s;e of the declaration of Cae&s;ar, <HI>"veni, vidi,
<PB N="81" REF="030158_0079_0FE4B1BD60E72FF0">
vici."</HI> Upwards of five hundred of the Briti&s;h laid down their arms, and were made pri&s;oners&mdash;a very con&s;iderable number was killed. Eight hundred &s;tands of arms, two field-pieces, and thirty-five baggage-waggons fell into the hands of the victors, who had only twelve killed, and &s;ixty wounded.</P>
<P>This brilliant &s;ucce&s;s quite di&s;con|certed the plan of operations formed by lord Cornwallis. Having enter|tained no idea of any enemy to oppo&s;e in South Carolina, the conque&s;t of which he had deemed complete, he had made every preparation for carry|ing his arms to the northward, to ga|ther the laurels, which he imagined awaited for him. He now found him|&s;elf
<PB N="82" REF="030158_0080_0FE4B1C0D8FAF178">
obliged to po&s;tpone this de&s;ign. He marched with rapidity after general Morgan, in hopes not only to recover the pri&s;oners, but to revenge Tarle|ton;s lo&s;&s;es. The Americans, by a ra|pidity of movements, and the inter|ference of providence,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Briti&s;h urged the pur&s;uit with &s;o much rapidity, that they came to the ford of the Catawba on the evening of the &s;ame day on which the Americans had cro&s;&s;ed it. Before the next day, a hea|vy fall of rain rendered it impa&s;&s;able.&mdash;Had it ri&s;en a few hours earlier, the Americans would have had no chance of e&s;cape, and their pri&s;oners would have been retaken by the enemy. Some time after, the &s;ame providential interference took palce in pa&s;&s;ing the Yadkin. A &s;udden and rapid ri&s;e, after the Ameri|cans had cro&s;&s;ed, prevented lord Corn|wallis from getting over. [Vide Ram|&s;ay, Vol. II p.206, 208.]</NOTE> eluded his

efforts, and general Greene effected a junction of the two divi&s;ions of his little army, on the 7th of February. Still was he &s;o far inferior to lord Cornwallis, that he was obliged to retreat northward, and, notwith&s;tand|ing the vigilance and activity of his enemy, he brought his men in &s;afety into Virginia.</P>
<P>In this &s;tate he received &s;ome rein|forcements, and had the promi&s;e of more&mdash;on which he returned again into North Carolina, where, on their arrival, he hoped to be able to act on the offen&s;ive. He encamped in the vicinity of lord Cornwallis's army&punc;&mdash;By a variety of the be&s;t concerted ma|noeuvres, and by the &s;ecrecy and
<PB N="84" REF="030158_0082_0FE4B1C5F4E240F8">
promptitude of his motions, he &s;o ju|diciou&s;ly &s;upported the arrangement of his troops, that during three weeks, while the enemy remained near him, he prevented them from taking any advantage of their &s;uperiority, and even cut off all opportunity of their receiving &s;uccours from the royal|i&s;ts.</P>
<P>About the beginning of March, he effected a junction with a continental regiment, and two con&s;iderable bodies of Virginia and Carolina militia. He then determined on attacking the Bri|ti&s;h commander without lo&s;s of time, being per&s;uaded," as he declared in his &s;ub&s;equent di&s;patches, <Q>that if he was &s;ucce&s;sful, it would prove
<PB N="85" REF="030158_0083_0FE4B1C8737923A8">
ruinous to the enemy&mdash;and, if other|wi&s;e, that it would be but a partial evil to him.</Q> On the 14th he arri|ved at Guilford court-hou&s;e, the Bri|ti&s;h then lying at twelve miles di&s;|tance.</P>
<P>His army con&s;i&s;ted of about four thou&s;and five hundred men, of whom near two thirds were North Carolina and Virginia militia. The Briti&s;h were about two thou&s;and four hundred, all regular troops, and the greater part inured to toil and &s;ervice in their long expedition under lord Cornwal|lis, who, on the morning of the 15th, being apprized of general Greene's intentions, marched to meet him. The latter di&s;po&s;ed his army in three
<PB N="86" REF="030158_0084_0FE4B1CCB47FF4E8">
lines; the militia of North Caroilna were in front&mdash;the &s;econd line was compo&s;ed of tho&s;e of Virginia,&mdash;and the third, which was the flower of the army, was formed of continen|tal troops, near fifteen hundred in number. They were flanked on both &s;ides by cavalry and riflemen, and were po&s;ted on a ri&s;ing ground, a mile and a half from Guilford Court Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>The engagement commenced at half an hour after one o'clock by a bri&s;k cannonade. After which the Bri|ti&s;h advanced in three columns, and attacked the fir&s;t line, compo&s;ed, as has been ob&s;erved, of North Carolina militia. The&s;e, who, probably, had
<PB N="87" REF="030158_0085_0FE4B1CE400CD910">
never been in action before, were pa|nic &s;truck at the approach of the ene|my, and many of them ran away with|out firing a gun, or being fired upon, and even before the Briti&s;h had come nearer than 140 yards to them. Part of them, however, fired, but they then followed the example of their comrades. Their officers made every po&s;&s;ible effort to rally them&mdash;but nei|ther the advantages of their po&s;ition, nor any other con&s;ideration, could in|duce them to maintain their ground. This &s;hameful cowardice had a great effect upon the i&s;&s;ue of the battle. The next line, however, behaved much bet|ter. They fought with great bravery; and after they were thrown into di&s;|order,
<PB N="88" REF="030158_0086_0FE3FABE55061868">
rallied, returned to the charge, and kept up a heavy fire for a long time, but were at length broken, and driven on the third line, when the engagement became general, very &s;evere, and very bloody. At length, &s;uperiority of di&s;cipline carried the day from &s;uperiority of numbers. The con|flict endured an hour and a half, and was terminated by general Greene's ordering a retreat, when he perceiv|ed, that the enemy were on the point of encircling his troops.</P>
<P>This was a hard fought action. Lord Cornwallis &s;tated his lo&s;&s;es in killed, wounded, and mi&s;&s;ing, at 532, among whom were &s;everal officers of con&s;i|derable rank. To tho&s;e who are u&s;ed
<PB N="89" REF="030158_0087_0FE4B1D0C3EAEE00">
to con&s;ider the thou&s;ands killed in the plains of Germany, very frequent|ly without producing any vi&s;ible con|&s;equence on the fate of a war, the number here mentioned mu&s;t appear in&s;ignificant. But this battle was, neverthele&s;s, deci&s;ive in its con&s;equen|ces. Lord Cornwallis was, three days after, obliged to make a retrograde motion, and to return to Wilmington, &s;ituated two hundred miles from the place of action. He was even under the nece&s;&s;ity of abandoning a con&s;ider|able number of tho&s;e who were mo&s;t dangerou&s;ly wounded.</P>
<P>The lo&s;s of the Americans was about four hundred killed and wound|ed. However, this was not &s;o &s;everely
<PB N="90" REF="030158_0088_0FE4B207B7807F00">
felt, as the de&s;ertion of a con&s;iderable number of militia, who fled home|wards, and came no more near the army.</P>
<P>Some time after this engagement, general Greene determined to return to South-Carolina, to endeavour to expel the Briti&s;h from that &s;tate. His fir&s;t object was to attempt the reduc|tion of Camden, where lord Raw|don was po&s;ted with about nine hun|dred men. The &s;trength of this place, which was covered on the &s;outh and ea&s;t &s;ides by a river and a creek, and to the we&s;tward and northward, by &s;ix redoubts, rendered it impracticable to carry it by &s;torm, with the &s;mall army general Greene had, con&s;i&s;ting of
<PB N="91" REF="030158_0089_0FE4B1D345522308">
about &s;even hundred continentals. He, therefore, encamped at about a mile from the town, in order to prevent &s;upplies from being brought in, and to take advantage of &s;uch favourable cir|cum&s;tances as might occur.</P>
<P>Lord Rawdon's &s;ituation was ex|tremely delicate. Colonel Wat&s;on, whom he had &s;ome time before de|tached for the protection of the ea&s;tern frontiers, and to whom he had, on intelligence of general Greene's inten|tions, &s;ent orders to return to Camden, was &s;o effectually watched by general Marian, that it was impo&s;&s;ible for him to obey. His lord&s;hip's &s;upplies were, moreover, very precarious:&mdash;and,
<PB N="92" REF="030158_0090_0FE4B1D79001BB88">
&s;hould general Greene's reinforce|ments arrive, he might be &s;o clo&s;ely inve&s;ted, as to be at length obliged to &s;urrender. In this dilemma, the be&s;t expedient that &s;ugge&s;ted it&s;elf, was a bold attack; for which purpo&s;e he ar|med his mu&s;icians and drummers, and every per&s;on capable of carrying a mu&s;|quet. He &s;allied out on the twenty-fifth of April, and attacked general Greene in his camp. The defence was ob&s;tinate, and, for &s;ome part of the engagement, the advantage appear|ed to be in favour of America.&mdash;Lieu|tenant colonel Wa&s;hington, who com|manded the cavarly, had at one time not le&s;s than two hundred Briti&s;h pri|&s;oners. However, by the mi&s;conduct
<PB N="93" REF="030158_0091_0FE4B1D918F655C8">

<P>The evacuation of Camden, with the vigilance of general Greene, and of the &s;everal officers he employed, gave a new face to affairs in South Caro|lina, where the Briti&s;h a&s;cendency declined more repidly than it had been e&s;tabli&s;hed. The numerous forts, gar|ri&s;oned by the enemy, fell, one after the other, into the hands of the Ame|ricans. Orangeburg, Motte, Wat&s;on, Georgetown, Granby, and all the others, &s;ort Ninety-&s;ix excepted, were &s;urrendered; and a very con&s;iderable number of pri&s;oners of war, with mili|tary

<P>On the 22nd of May, general Greene &s;at down before Ninety-&s;ix, with the main part of his little army. The &s;iege was carried on for a con&s;iderable time with great &s;pirit: and the place was defended with equal bravery. At length, the works were &s;o far re|duced, that a &s;urrender mu&s;t have been made in a few days, when a re|inforcement, of three regiments, from Europe, arrived at Charle&s;ton, which enabled lord Rawdon to proceed to relieve this important po&s;t. The &s;uperiority of the enemy's force, reduced general Greene to the alter|native of abandoning the &s;iege altoge|ther,
<PB N="96" REF="030158_0094_0FE4B1E244BE1C80">
or, previous to their arrival, of attempting the fort by &s;torm. The latter was more agreeable to his enter|pri&s;ing &s;pirit: and an attack was made on the morning of the 29th of June. He was repul&s;ed, with the lo&s;s of one hundred and fifty men. He rai&s;ed the &s;iege, and retreated over the Saluda.</P>

of the whole country, to be compel|led to retreat to its extremity: after &s;ubduing the greate&s;t part of the force &s;ent again&s;t them, to be under the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of encountering &s;till greater re|inforcements, when their remote &s;itu|ation precluded them from the hope of receiving a &s;ingle recruit&mdash;in this gloomy &s;ituation, there were not wanting per&s;ons who advi&s;ed general Greene to leave the &s;tate, and retire with his remaining forces to Virginia. To arguments and &s;ugge&s;tions of this kind he nobly replied&mdash;'I will reco|ver the country, or die in the at|tempt.' This di&s;tingui&s;hed officer, who&s;e genius was mo&s;t vigorous in tho&s;e extremities, when feeble minds

<P>Some &s;kirmi&s;hes, of no great mo|ment, took place between detached parties of both armies in July and Augu&s;t. September the 9th, general Greene having a&s;&s;embled about two thou&s;and men, proceeded to attack the Briti&s;h, who, under the com|mand of col. Stewart, were po&s;ted at Eutaw Springs. The American force was drawn up in two lines: the fir&s;t, compo&s;ed of Carolina militia, was commanded by generals Marian and Pickens, and col. De Malmedy.&mdash;The &s;econd, which con&s;i&s;ted of con|tinental

troops from North Carolina, Virginia, and Maryland, was com|manded by general Sumpter, lieut. col. Campbell, and colonel Williams; lieutenant-colonel Lee, with his legion, covered the right flank; and lieuten|ant-colonel Hender&s;on, with the &s;tate troops, covered the left. A corps de re&s;erve was formed of the cavalry, under lieutenant-colonel Wa&s;hington, and the Delaware troops under capt. Kirkwood. As the Americans came forward to the attack, they fell in with &s;ome advanced parties of the enemy, at about two or three miles a-head of the main body. The&s;e being clo&s;ely pur&s;ued, were driven back&mdash;and the action &s;oon became general.
<PB N="100" REF="030158_0098_0FE4B1ECF18108E0">
The militia were at length forced to give way, but were bravely &s;upported by the &s;econd line. In the hotte&s;t part of the engagement, gen. Greene ordered the Maryland and Virginia continentals to charge with trailed arms. This decided the fate of the day. "Nothing," &s;ays dr. Ram&s;ay, "could &s;urpa&s;s the intrepidity of both officers and men on this occa&s;ion.&mdash;They ru&s;hed on, in good order, thro' a heavy cannonade, and a &s;hower of mu&s;quetry, with &s;uch un&s;haken re&s;o|lution, that they bore down all before them." The Briti&s;h were broken, clo&s;ely pur&s;ued, and upwards of five hundred of them taken pri&s;oners&mdash;They however made a fre&s;h &s;tand, in
<PB N="101" REF="030158_0099_0FE4B1EE7A95F0A8">
a favourable po&s;ition, in impenetrable &s;hrubs and a picquetted garden. Lieu|tenant-colonel Wa&s;hington, after hav|ing made every effort to di&s;lodge them, was wounded and taken pri|&s;oner. Four &s;ix pounders were brought forward to play upon them, but they fell into their hands; and the endeavours to drive them from their &s;tation being found impractica|ble, the Americans retired, leaving a &s;trong piequet on the field of battle. Their lo&s;s was about five hundred; that of the Briti&s;h upwards of eleven hundred.</P>
<P>General Greene was honoured by congre&s;s with a Briti&s;h &s;tandard, and a gold medal, emblematical of the

engagement and &s;ucce&s;s, "for his wife, deci&s;ive, and magnanimous con|duct, in the action at Eutaw &s;prings, in which, with a force inferior in number to that of the enemy, he ob|tained a mo&s;t &s;ignal victory."</P>
<P>In the evening of the &s;ucceeding day, colonel Stewart abandoned his po&s;t, and retreated towards Charle&s;|ton, leaving behind upwards of &s;e|venty of his wounded, and a thou|&s;and &s;tands of arms. He was pur&s;ued a con&s;iderable di&s;tance&mdash;but in vain.</P>
<P>The battle of Eutaw produced mo&s;t &s;ignal con&s;equences in favour of Ame|rica. The Briti&s;h, who had for &s;uch a length of time lorded it ab&s;olutely in South Carolina, were, &s;hortly after
<PB N="103" REF="030158_0101_0FE4B1F384B05910">
that event, obliged to confine them|&s;elves in Charle&s;ton, whence they ne|ver ventured but to make predatory excur&s;ions, with bodies of cavalry, which in general met with a very warm and very unwelcome reception.</P>
<P>During the relxation that followed, a dangerous plot was formed, by &s;ome turbulent and mutinous per&s;ons in the army, to deliver up their brave gene|ral to the Briti&s;h. This trea&s;onable de&s;ign owed its ri&s;e to the hard&s;hips, wants, and calamities of the &s;oldiers, who were ill paid, ill clothed, and ill fed. The con&s;pirators did not ex|ceed twelve in number: and a provi|dential di&s;covery defeated the project.</P>

The &s;urrender of lord Cornwallis, who&s;e enterpri&s;ing &s;pirit had been by the Briti&s;h mini&s;try expected to repair the lo&s;&s;es, and wipe away the di&s;grace, which had been incurred through the inactivity and indolence of other gene|rals, having convinced them of the im|practicability of &s;ubjugating America, they di&s;continued offen&s;ive operations in every quarter. From the begin|ning of the year 1782, it was cur|rently reported, that Charle&s;ton was &s;peedily to be evaucated: it was offi|cially announced the &s;eventh of Au|gu&s;t; but did not take place until the &s;eventeenth of December.</P>

The happy period at length arrived, when, by the virtue and bravery of her &s;ons, aided by the bounty of hea|ven, America compelled her invaders to recogni&s;e her independence. Then her armies, quitted the tented fields, and retired to cultivate the arts of peace and happine&s;s. Among the re&s;t, general Greene revi&s;ited his na|tive country, where he proved him&s;elf as valuable a citizen, as the Carolinas had witne&s;&s;ed him a gallant officer. Di&s;&s;en&s;ions and jealou&s;ies had extend|ed their de&s;tructive influence among the Rhode I&s;landers, who&s;e animo&s;ity had ari&s;en to &s;uch a degree, as to threaten the mo&s;t &s;erious ill con&s;e|quences: general Greene exerted

<P>In October, 1785, he &s;ailed to Georgia, where he had a con&s;iderable e&s;tate, not far di&s;tant from Savannah. Here he pa&s;&s;ed away his time, occu|pied in his dome&s;tic concerns, until the hour of his mortality approached. Walking out one day in June 1786, he was overpowered by the extreme heat of the &s;un, which brought on a di&s;order that carried him off, a few days after, on the 19th of the &s;ame month.</P>
<P>When the melancholy account of his death arrived at Savannah, the people were &s;truck with the deepe&s;t

The impolicy of Lewis the fourteenth in revoking the edict of Nantz, and the con&s;equent emigration from France of hundreds of thou&s;ands of valuable arti&s;ts and manufacturers, imparted various arts to Germany, Holland, and England, whereof France had had an almo&s;t entire monopoly.

<HEAD>Mr. CHALMERS.</HEAD>
<P>THIS gentleman is, in &s;ome re&s;pects, the fir&s;t performer in Ame|rica. In others, he is &s;econd to Mr. Hodgkin&s;on, who, as a general actor, &s;tands undoubtedly at the head of his profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>In genteel comedy, the palm mu&s;t be given to Mr. Chalmers. In this
<PB N="126" REF="030158_0124_0FE4B232777F7948">
department he &s;tands unrivalled. His Belcour cannot be excelled. He &s;hines with di&s;tingui&s;hed lu&s;tre in this character, which is drawn in the happie&s;t manner, and with all the fire and animation of a Congreve or Far|quhar. To the violent pa&s;&s;ions&mdash;the punctilious &s;en&s;e of honour&mdash;the mag|nanimity of this &s;on of the torrid zone, Cumberland could not wi&s;h more complete ju&s;tice done.</P>
<P>His Belville, in the &s;chool for wives, is nearly equal to Belcour, He a&s;&s;umes the variety that marks this character, with the utmo&s;t ea&s;e and propriety&mdash;and is by turns an affectionate, though a di&s;&s;olute hu&s;band&mdash;an abandoned &s;educer&mdash;and a man of &s;uch true
<PB N="127" REF="030158_0125_0FE4B234FA923F58">
honor, as to refu&s;e to rai&s;e his arm, except in &s;elf-defence, again&s;t him whom he has endeavoured to injure in the tendere&s;t point, his &s;i&s;ter's virtue.</P>
<P>His Modely, in the Farm Hou&s;e, gives the fulle&s;t expre&s;&s;ion to the author's ideas. The licentious man|ners, the depravity of principle, the fa&s;cinating affability of this well-drawn portrait, &s;it on him as ea&s;y as the dre&s;s he wears.</P>
<P>In the Clande&s;tine Marriage, he does ample ju&s;tice to the excentri|cities of that variegated character, Lord Ogleby&mdash;to his gallant and amiable attentions to the fair &s;ex&mdash;to
<PB N="128" REF="030158_0126_0FE4B238F24D6930">
his vanity&mdash;to his genero&s;ity&mdash;and to his affectation of pri&s;tine vigour, while groaning under the excruciating tor|tures, ari&s;ing from his di&s;&s;olute life.</P>
<P>His Vapid, in the Dramati&s;t, is by no means inferior to the former. To this character and that of Marplot, in the Bu&s;y Body, it may be objected, that they are not within, they are beyond nature. They carry the improbable con&s;picuou&s;ly &s;tamped on their foreheads. Mr. Chalmers, however, by his excellent perform|ance, almo&s;t induces the &s;pectator to believe the&s;e per&s;onages not only probable, but actually before his eyes.</P>
<P><PB N="129" REF="030158_0127_0FE4B23A8000A410">
In no character, perhaps, does he &s;hine to more advantage, than in Pe|ter Puff, in the Critic. To equal him in this, is difficult&mdash;to excel him, impo&s;&s;ible. This part requires ince&s;&s;ant exertion; and the &s;pectator is lo&s;t in a&s;toni&s;hment, at the un|abated life and &s;pirit, di&s;played for an hour and a half, during which mind and body have hardly a moment's relaxation. The humorous extem|poraneous flights in which he occa|&s;ionally indulges, give the highe&s;t po&s;|&s;ible &s;ea&s;oning to the intellectual fea&s;t.</P>
<P>He has &s;eldom attempted low co|medy. But when he has, his &s;ucce&s;&s; has been con&s;iderable. His Trappanti, in She Would and She Would Not,
<PB N="130" REF="030158_0128_0FE4B23DF1BA1A40">
is perfectly natural, and puts in the mo&s;t con&s;picuous light all the roguery, cunning, and humour, that Cibber be&s;towed on the character.</P>
<P>I have but &s;eldom &s;een him in tragedy, and am therefore, not fully competent to pa&s;s an opinion on him as a tragedian. So far, how|ever, as I have &s;een, his abilities in this line are inferior to tho&s;e he di&s;|plays in the former. In awful or terrific &s;cenes, he verges towards rant&mdash;he works him&s;elf into a degree of violent pa&s;&s;ion, which often affrights, but &s;ometimes fails of exciting the &s;en|&s;ibility of the &s;pectator.</P>
<P>His Hamlet is, however, extremely well performed. In the interview
<PB N="131" REF="030158_0129_0FE4B23F794A1788">
with his mother, he is truly great&mdash;and likewi&s;e when the players repre|&s;ent their tragedy before the king and queen.</P>
<P>His La Motte, in Fontainville Fo|re&s;t, is not equal to the former. This character is hardly natural, and is therefore the more difficult to re|pre&s;ent. However, the &s;torm of conflicting pa&s;&s;ions, by which he is impelled forward to the perpetration of the crime that threw him into the power of Lord Montault, is fully and forcibly expre&s;&s;ed in his countenance and manner.</P>
<P>To conclude, Mr. Chalmers po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;es all the e&s;&s;ential qualifications that con&s;titute a capital performer.
<PB N="132" REF="030158_0130_0FE4B243CF885950">
His addre&s;s is ea&s;y and uncon&s;trained&mdash;he hardly ever requires the Promp|ter's aid&mdash;his delivery is equally becoming and natural in the volu|bility of Peter Puff&mdash;the airy flights of Belcour&mdash;the &s;eductive &s;ophi&s;try of Belville&mdash;or the tardy but monitory repentance of Beverly.</P>

<HEAD>NUMBER II. Mrs. WHITLOCK.</HEAD>
<P>PERHAPS I &s;hall not be charged with inju&s;tice or partiality, when I venture to pronounce this lady the fir&s;t actre&s;s in America. In Tra|gedy, &s;he &s;tands at a great di&s;tance from every rival; and her abilities in genteel comedy are very great, far beyond what are u&s;ually met with in tho&s;e who excel in the former department. In the terrific, the awful, the pathe|tic &s;cenes of highly fini&s;hed tragedy, &s;he has an unlimited command over
<PB N="134" REF="030158_0132_0FE4B247D7C37F00">
the feelings of the &s;pectators. And it not unfrequently happens, that hardy veterans, unappalled in the field of battle, bear te&s;timony, by the trickling tears, "cour&s;ing, each other down their cheeks," to her a&s;toni&s;hing powers. I have never &s;een a performer, not even excepting the far-famed Mrs. Seddons, who has been able to excite in me &s;uch highly plea&s;urable emotions, as I have repeat|edly experienced from the excellent performance of Mrs. Whitlock.</P>
<P>In that unfeeling character, Lady Macboth, &s;he di&s;plays, in its genuine colours, that headlong ambition, which &s;tifles the voice of humanity, of loyalty, of honour, and of female timidity,
<PB N="135" REF="030158_0133_0FE4B24B50A14748">
Her madne&s;s is admirably counter|feited.</P>
<P>In Milton's Ma&s;que of Comus, &s;he adds new dignity, by the force of the mo&s;t excellent delivery, to the exal|ted &s;entiments of that great writer.</P>
<P>Who, that has &s;een her Mrs. Be|verley, in the Game&s;ter, can with|hold admiration and applau&s;e, at the tenderne&s;s, the &s;en&s;ibility, the di&s;tre&s;s, the &s;o naturally exhibits in the various &s;tages of this u&s;eful, this in&s;tructive tragedy?</P>
<P>Eliza Ratcliffe, in the Jew, is by no means &s;o intere&s;ting as the former character; however, her &s;en&s;ibility and terror, on the rupture between her hu&s;band and brother&mdash;her perfect reli|ance
<PB N="136" REF="030158_0134_0FE4B24E48030E50">
on the honour of the former, when he &s;olemnly promi&s;es to avoid any further quarrel&mdash;her re&s;pectful behaviour to Sir Stephen Bertram, in their interview&mdash;her anxiety and &s;u&s;|pence, when &s;he apprehends his con|gratulations on her &s;uppo&s;ed &s;udden good fortune, are only ironical re|proaches of her real poverty&mdash;and her joy at the happy reconciliation between her hu&s;band and his family, are expre&s;&s;ed with great ju&s;tice and propriety.</P>
<P>In the Orphan, &s;he performs Moni|mia, in a capital manner. Her well expre&s;&s;ed love for the gentle Ca&s;talio, and di&s;like for the brutal Polydore&mdash;her agonizing torture at the &s;corn and
<PB N="137" REF="030158_0135_0FE4B250C7228DA8">
contempt &s;he experiences from her hu&s;band&mdash;her horror at the di&s;clo&s;ure of the ince&s;tuous, but involuntary con|nections with her brother-in-law&mdash;and her &s;ub&s;equent madne&s;s and death, cannot fail of receiving the loude&s;t tributes of applau&s;e from every judi|cious &s;pectator. And could excel|lence of acting compen&s;ate for the gro&s;&s;e&s;t fundamental errors of a dra|matic compo&s;ition, Mrs. Whitlock in Monimia, Mr. Chalmers in Chamont, Mr. Whitlock in Aca&s;to, and Mr. Moreton in Ca&s;talio, might warrant a repetition of this tragedy. But the gro&s;&s;ne&s;s of many of the &s;entiments expre&s;&s;ed by polydore&mdash;the di&s;gu&s;t|ing incident on which the entire inte|re&s;t
<PB N="138" REF="030158_0136_0FE4B2524D761F08">
of the piece turns&mdash;and the multi|plied butchery which clo&s;es it, ought to con&s;ign the Orphan to eternal ob|livion.</P>
<P>In that fini&s;hed portrait, Lady Elea|nor Irwin, in Every one has his Fault, &s;he appears to as much advantage, as in any of the characters &s;he a&s;&s;umes, Filial tenderne&s;s and affection &s;purned to the ground by an unrelenting and hard-hearted father, cannot po&s;&s;ibly find expre&s;&s;ion beyond what &s;he exhi|bits. The corroding cares of a tender wife, who&s;e loved and loving hu&s;band is in danger of an ignominious death, are mo&s;t pathetically depicted in her countenance, and by &s;ympathy affect the &s;pectators with a portion of her
<PB N="139" REF="030158_0137_0FE4B254CF9AB870">
di&s;tre&s;s. But what can be beyond the grand &s;cene in which &s;he di&s;co|vers her long-lo&s;t &s;on, and &s;trug|gles between her regard for him and her love for his father, whether, at the expen&s;e of the former, &s;he &s;hall keep the fatal pocket-book, or re&s;tore it, to the danger of the latter? This exqui&s;ite treat for feeling minds is hardly equalled&mdash;but certainly not excelled by any &s;cene ever written in our language; and to the prai&s;e of Mrs. Whitlock, it mu&s;t be &s;aid, that the merit of the actre&s;s is at lea&s;t equal to that of the author.</P>
<P>To conclude. Mrs. Whitlock has a dignified carriage; her pronunciation is animated; her voice and her coun|tenance
<PB N="140" REF="030158_0138_0FE4B258EFC96DD0">
are capable of every inflection nece&s;&s;ary to expre&s;s the mo&s;t oppo&s;ite emotions and pa&s;&s;ions, with the utmo&s;t promptitude&mdash;her memory is &s;o good, and her application &s;o a&s;&s;iduous, as to leave her little indebt to the prompter's aid&mdash;and, except her per&s;on, which approaches towards the ma&s;culine, &s;he has every qualification de&s;irable in an actre&s;s.</P>

<HEAD>NUMBER III. Mr. HARWOOD.</HEAD>
<P>THIS gentleman, who, perhaps, ranks next to Mr. Chalmers, among the male performers, is in high favour with the amateurs of the drama.&mdash;At his entr&eacute; here, he attracted little attention&mdash;but &s;uddenly came forward with great and unexpected eclat.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t character in which he made a con&s;iderable figure, was that of Dr. Lenitive, in the prize, or 2, 3, 5, 8, in which he charmed the &s;pec|tators,
<PB N="142" REF="030158_0140_0FE4B25E01FBB4A8">
by his humour and originality&mdash;the avarice of this di&s;ciple of Galen, his gro&s;s ignorance, his ridiculous pedantry, his up&s;tart pride, on his &s;up|po&s;ed good fortune, were mo&s;t admi|rably per&s;onated. The &s;pectator was led into that agreeable delu&s;ion which deceives him into a belief, that the tran&s;ient &s;cene is acting on the great &s;tage of the world, which con&s;titutes the chief merit of a good performer.</P>
<P>His Fretful Plagiary is even &s;upe|rior to Lenitive. He does complete ju&s;tice to the te&s;tine&s;s of this literary &s;hark, and to his affected indifference for and agonizing torture under the cauterizing critici&s;ms of the new&s;|paper writers.</P>
<P><PB N="143" REF="030158_0141_0FE4B25F88BF5970">
His Walter in the delightful after|piece of the Children in the Wood, is well performed, but inferior to Hodgkin&s;on's.&mdash;However, he has improved con&s;iderably in the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive repre&s;entations. His &s;ong of "Doro|thy Dump" is extremely well &s;ung, and accompanied with natural and highly humourous ge&s;tures. In the interview with Oliver, whom he en|deavors to di&s;&s;uade from his in<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">tion of murdering the infants, and in the &s;cene where they are brought in by their parents, he is equal to Hodgkin|&s;on. The parts in which he is inferior, are, when he is di&s;covered by Sir Rowland, and throughout in his court&s;hip with jo&s;ephine, which Mr.
<PB N="144" REF="030158_0142_0FE4B263C61EBA08">
Hodgkin&s;on repre&s;ents with more true nature and grace.</P>
<P>His Sir David Dunder, in Ways and Means, gives great &s;atisfaction. His articulation is particularly adapted to the volubility of this ho&s;pitable knight; as likewi&s;e to that of</P>
<P>Prattle, in the Deuce is in Him, in which his performance was extremely natural.</P>
<P>His Jabal in Cumberland's Jew, was received with great applau&s;e, as he filled the character with perfect propriety.</P>
<P>In the Baron of Oakland, Haunt|ed Tower, Fulmer in the We&s;t-Indian, and the Planter in Yarico and Inkle, he appeared to no great advantage.
<PB N="145" REF="030158_0143_0FE4B2654D00E350">
In the fir&s;t, the affected dignity of the ba&s;e u&s;urper did not &s;eem to become him.</P>
<P>In Old Barnacle in the Romp, he di&s;plays the rough <HI>noli-me-tangere</HI> manners of a boi&s;terous &s;on of the waves, extremely well.</P>
<P>His Canton, in the Clande&s;tine Marriage, is as good a repre&s;enta|tion of the finicking, fanta&s;tic, and fawning manners, be&s;towed in mo&s;t Engli&s;h plays on French characters, as any I have &s;een. But it is to be hoped, that in "this country of good &s;en&s;e," we will ri&s;e &s;uperior to the de&s;picable and odious vice of holding up the inhabitants of any country, or profe&s;&s;ors of any &s;ect, as objects of
<PB N="146" REF="030158_0144_0FE4B267D058C8B0">
ridicule, to gratify our over-weening vanity by the flattering compari&s;on.</P>
<P>His Mayor of Coventry and Jef|fery Latimer are judiciou&s;ly played and command great approbation.</P>
<P>From his great &s;ucce&s;s in humour|ous characters, it was hardly &s;uppo&s;ed that his powers were calculated to do ju&s;tice to the tenderne&s;s of conjugal love. But who enjoyed the exqui|&s;ite plea&s;ure communicated by the interview with his Sall in the Pur&s;e, that did not in&s;tantly acknowledge how egregious was the mi&s;take? Gar|rick him&s;elf could hardly have ex|ceeded him in this &s;cene, had he played the part. It was affecting to the highe&s;t degree. The &s;oul that
<PB N="147" REF="030158_0145_0FE4B26B496430A8">
can be unmoved at &s;uch a capital di&s;|play of the mo&s;t intere&s;ting emotions of the human brea&s;t, mu&s;t partake largely of the nature of "the rugged rhinoceros, or the Ru&s;&s;ian bear." In|deed, throughout the whole of the Pur&s;e, his performance is highly ju&s;t and natural.</P>
<P>To conclude. Mr. Harwood is an extremely valuable actor. His merits in many characters are of the fir&s;t rate. He can a&s;&s;ume as great a variety of countenance and manner as any per|former in this city. His articulation is either rapid as the falls of Niagara, or &s;low and &s;tately as the meandering Su&s;quehanna, according to the charac|ters he repre&s;ents. He is, however,
<PB N="148" REF="030158_0146_0FE4B26EAFEF3D80">
often indebted to Mr. Row&s;on's aid&mdash;which, whether it ari&s;es from defect of memory, or want of application, is certainly a con&s;iderable drawback on the gratification received from his performance. He is young, and im|proving, and bids fair, at no very di&s;tant period, to arrive at a very un|common degree of reputation in his profe&s;&s;ion.</P>

She has a plea|&s;ing figure, and a prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing coun|tenance, which, if any dependance is to be placed on phy&s;iognomy, is "the title page to a mo&s;t captivating vo|lume."

powers and execution are far &s;uperior to hers, in the opinion of the amateurs.</P>
<P>Her performance of the Country Girl has been pronounced by compe|tent judges nearly equal to that of the celebrated Mrs. Jordan, who, in Eng|land, is regarded as having arrived at the <HI>acme</HI> of excellence in this charac|ter. The craft and artifice, be&s;towed by native in&s;tinct, to counteract the &s;elfi&s;h and ba&s;e de&s;igns of her &s;uper|annuated guardian, are admirably co|vered by the mo&s;t natural and impo|&s;ing &s;implicity.</P>
<P>Her Edward, in Every One has his Fault, is equal to any of her cha|racters. She divides with Mrs. Whit|lock the merit of that mo&s;t admira|ble

&s;cene, in which the mother and &s;on di&s;cover each other.

than this actre&s;s. She a&s;&s;umes the dre&s;s, and with the dre&s;s the genuine manner of the young tarpaulin, with the utmo&s;t ea&s;e. And in this di&s;gui&s;e, one time of performance, &s;he recei|ved as genuine a tribute, as was ever be&s;towed. The &s;tory has been alrea|dy told in the papers; but I &s;hall, I hope, be pardoned for repeating it here.

<PB N="153" REF="030158_0151_0FE4B27B4096A668">
was rather roughly handled; for the action being mi&s;taken for an in&s;ult, he was driven out of the hou&s;e, amid&s;t the hi&s;&s;es and abu&s;e of the &s;pectators.</P>
<P>In Emily, in the Deuce is in Him, her performance is natural and &s;pirited. But nature, in choo&s;ing the materials for her compo&s;ition, threw in an over proportion of the ri&s;ible. Humour and merriment are, therefore, her predominent qualities. Nature &s;ome|times triumphs, in &s;pite of every effort to di&s;gui&s;e or counteract her. This was never more perceptible, than in the interview with her limping lover, colonel Tamper, who&s;e awkward and disfigured appearance &s;o completely tickled her fancy, that &s;he could not

It is hoped the little char|mer will attend to this friendly hint, and in &s;erious parts, lay in a &s;uitable &s;tock of gravity.</P>
<P>In Pri&s;cilla Tomboy, &s;he is hardly equal to Mrs. Hodgkin&s;on, who &s;hines in this character.</P>

<HEAD>ADVANTAGES OF OVER-TRADING.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">In a Letter to a Friend.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU have a&s;ked my opinion re&s;pecting over-trading, of which you &s;eem to be highly afraid. But I hope &s;o clearly to point out its advantages, as to remove all your &s;cruples, and to induce you to pur&s;ue the &s;teps of &s;o many of your fellow citizens, who enjoy all the comforts and conveni|ences of this laudable practice.</P>
<P><PB N="159" REF="030158_0157_0FE4B28BCC614408">
With all my partiality for it, I freely acknowledge, that its benefits do not appear very evident, but at particular &s;ea&s;ons, and during times of &s;tagnation.&mdash;When bu&s;ine&s;s is bri&s;k, one is tempted to overlook the advan|tages. But he mu&s;t be a mo&s;t incor|rigible &s;ceptic, that can doubt its ble&s;|&s;ings, when money is &s;carce, when trade is dull, when banks curtail di&s;|counts, &amp;c.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, during the winter and &s;ummer months, when bu&s;ine&s;s is at a &s;tand, and nothing doing, what re&s;ource can a man have, who has not over-traded, to keep him&s;elf employed? None. He is devoured by vapours, by ennui, by li&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s.
<PB N="160" REF="030158_0158_0FE4B28F099D3268">
Time hangs on his hands a heavy burden.</P>
<P>But mark the contra&s;t. The man who has run him&s;elf comforably in debt, to the amount of 15, 20, or 30,000 dollars, has not an unemployed vacant hour, day or night. As &s;oon as he ri&s;es in the morning, he has to exerci&s;e him&s;elf in walking over the city to borow a few dollars here and there&mdash;What a charming opportunity it gives a man to &s;ee his acquaintance! How acceptable mu&s;t his vi&s;its be, which are certain title-pages to a beggarly reque&s;t for money! What a touch&s;tone he is to prove the &s;incerity of his friends!&mdash;When he lies down at night, &s;lumber flies from his pillow,
<PB N="161" REF="030158_0159_0FE4B2909AE62778">
and his whole attention is turned to devi&s;e &s;i&s;cal arrangements for the fol|lowing day.</P>
<P>As times grow wor&s;e, the&s;e com|forts increa&s;e. You have the plea&s;ure &s;ometimes of borrowing daily, to pay the &s;ucceeding morning or afternoon. What a re&s;pectable &s;ight it is, to behold you or your clerk, &s;neaking to the bank after the directors have gone away, to anticipate, by a few hours, the knowledge of their deci&s;ion upon the notes you have offered! What a mournful countenance you exhibit, when your notes are returned to you, hanging out of your book, with the mark of the bea&s;t on them! How you puff and blow running about
<PB N="162" REF="030158_0160_0FE4B2932DEF4ED0">
from &s;treet to &s;treet, to borrow money, and get into bank before three o'clock! What a number of promi&s;es you make, impo&s;&s;ible to be performed!</P>
<P>As the climax ri&s;es, new &s;hifts open to your view. To over-draw is a mo&s;t capacious one. It &s;tays for a while the impending torrent of di&s;|tre&s;s. What a charming exerci&s;e for your dexterity, to keep your book out of the hands of the clerks, le&s;t they &s;hould &s;eize it, and expo&s;e how frequently the balance is on the wrong &s;ide!</P>
<P>When borrowing is at an end, and the clerks of the banks grow too wary to allow you to over-draw, a further advantage ari&s;es. You are
<PB N="163" REF="030158_0161_0FE4B295D11D7070">
introduced to the acquaintance of that very worthy and con&s;cientious race of men, who &s;eem born for the relief of per&s;ons in di&s;tre&s;s. I mean the friendly cla&s;s of u&s;urers. You may at fir&s;t hire money of them, at one per cent. a month&mdash;afterwards at two&mdash;and, as their <HI>charity</HI> grows with your di&s;tre&s;s, it will probably ri&s;e to four or five, if your &s;ufferings &s;hould be &s;o great as to excite an extraordinary degree of &s;ympathy in their tender hearts.</P>
<P>You will probably think that this is the ne plus ultra of the advantages of this mode of doing bu&s;ine&s;s. So did I at fir&s;t. But I &s;oon di&s;covered my mi&s;take. Rats, they &s;ay, de&s;ert a

&s;inking &s;hip. They are warned by the in&s;tinct be&s;towed on them by mother nature. The u&s;urers po&s;&s;e&s;s an in&s;tinct &s;imilar to this&mdash;and generally &s;mell out a &s;inking firm, from which they contrive to make an early e&s;cape. Then your acquaintance extends fur|ther. A worthy man, whom they call a notary public, kindly calls on you, brightens up your recollection of a note you forgot to pay a bank, and demands payment, which you are not able to make. This vi&s;it, &s;up|po&s;ing you are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of any &s;en&s;i|bility, di&s;plays your countenance to great advantage. The plea&s;ing mix|ture of charming red with which it

&s;uffu&s;es your cheeks, heightens your natural beauties to the utmo&s;t degree.</P>
<P>I have not noticed the amount of the intere&s;t you pay. Suppo&s;ing you to have the moderate &s;um of 12,000 dollars of bank money in trade, you do not pay much more than 1,000 dollars a year. This is a mere baga|telle, unworthy of notice. Indeed, were it not for &s;ome &s;uch drain as this, it would be impo&s;&s;ible to find employment for the immen&s;e profits of trade at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>Another advantage which I pa&s;&s;ed over, is, the improvement in polite|ne&s;s and good behaviour, which you derive from your cringing vi&s;its to directors and pre&s;idents of banks&mdash;
<PB N="166" REF="030158_0164_0FE4B29F22C6FC10">
your dancing attendance at their levees&mdash;your reque&s;ts, they will be &s;o kind as to pay attention to your notes, &amp;c.</P>
<P>I might extend the enumeration much farther&mdash;but &s;hall conclude for the pre&s;ent with the ob&s;ervation, that the man who involves him&s;elf by over-trading, has, in the fulle&s;t &s;en&s;e of the words, <HI>"taken up his cro&s;s"</HI>&mdash;a cro&s;s which half a life may be too little to enable him to lay down again.</P>

<P>ARE the pre&s;ent times, really and <HI>bona fide,</HI> as di&s;tre&s;&s;ing and calami|tous, as they are univer&s;ally &s;aid to be?

with preci&s;ion the ideas con|veyed by words in general u&s;e, is one of the mo&s;t abundant &s;ources of hu|man ignorance and error. Perhaps, without incurring the charge of para|dox, it may be added, that the mo&s;t familiar terms are often lea&s;t under|&s;tood.
