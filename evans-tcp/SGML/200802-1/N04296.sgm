<HEAD>A DISCOURSE CONCERNING PAPER MONEY, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THE rarity of &s;ilver and its beautiful colour were &s;ufficient before it became a medium of Trade, to procure it a price, even &s;uppo&s;ing it de&s;titute of <HI>natural</HI> value; tho' &s;uch a kind of worth is merely <HI>fan|ta&s;tical,</HI> like that of diamonds, which is al&s;o derived from <HI>fancy.</HI></P>
<P>Silver is &s;till a commodity, as every thing bought and &s;old is; but then it is al&s;o money, which gives it a rank above other wares exchanged by it.</P>
<P>That commodity for which the re&s;t in the country are <HI>generally</HI> bought and &s;old, is the currency or money of the country.</P>
<P>The nummary denominations, and by which accounts are kept, throughout <HI>Europe,</HI> do all &s;tand for certain quantities of &s;ilver, and none of 'em for gold: Therefore as all contracts, in that part of the world are made for the fir&s;t, and not any for the &s;econd, tho' they may be di&s;charged by it, ac|cording to its <HI>varying</HI> rate; the former is the currency of <HI>Europe,</HI> and the latter is nothing more than a commodity.</P>
<P>In <HI>Virginia</HI> and <HI>Maryland,</HI> tobacco being that for which all other commodities are <HI>generally</HI> exchanged, is the currency of the&s;e Provinces, as rice is, for a like rea&s;on, in <HI>South-Carolina;</HI> yet they are not &s;o by the &s;anction of law: It is there|fore <HI>probable</HI> that &s;ilver, being much better qualified than either of 'em for a medi|um of commerce, ro&s;e up to that dignity by its own proper force; for the im|pre&s;&s;ion that the &s;everal pieces, into which it is divided, receive at the mint, is of no other u&s;e than to a&s;certain their re&s;pective quantites and finene&s;s, in order to &s;ave the trouble of weighing and trying 'em on every occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>But bits of paper, however denominated, could never become a currency without the <HI>compul&s;ive</HI> aid of the legi&s;lature; for, if all had been left <HI>at liberty</HI> to refu&s;e them, their nummary denominations could never have per&s;uaded any bo|dy to give any thing for 'em.</P>
<P>In the year 1722 the government of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> began to coin paper-money. The &s;um of 15,000 l. was then &s;truck in bills of <HI>one</HI> &s;hilling to <HI>twenty,</HI> which was lent out on land-&s;ecurity at five <HI>per cent.</HI> Tho&s;e bill the legi&s;lature decla+red
<PB N="4" REF="005308_0004_1016FA9E7029C5E0">
equal to as much &s;ilver-money of <HI>America</HI> as their re&s;pective denominations &s;ignified. Had the law &s;topt here their value could not have ro&s;e above wa&s;te paper. But as they were al&s;o made according to their declared rates, a legal tender in di&s;charge of the &s;ilver-contracts then &s;ub&s;i&s;ting, they naturally became money:</P>
<P>For debtors were <HI>willingly</HI> led to &s;ell their goods for 'em at the nominal value a&s;&s;igned by the legi&s;lature, <HI>knowing</HI> they could pa&s;s 'em on the &s;ame foot|ing to their creditors; who&s;e intere&s;t it al&s;o became to &s;upport the credit of the new coin, while they had any debts remaining unpaid in the old. Other tra|ders, as may well be &s;uppo&s;ed, were at fir&s;t fearful to contract for this new &s;pe|cies of money; but finding it kept up its value, or (when they <HI>fancied</HI> it did not) that the advanced price on their goods ballanced the <HI>imaginary</HI> lo&s;s, they were as eager to bargain for it as they were before for &s;ilver.</P>
<P>Were it not for the confu&s;ion which an alteration in the nummary denominati|ons, that people have have been accu&s;tomed to count by, would produce in trade, tho&s;e paper bills might as well have been called and di&s;tingui&s;hed by <HI>livres, &s;ols</HI> and <HI>deniers,</HI> or by any other terms of value, as by <HI>pounds, &s;hillings</HI> and <HI>pence.</HI> The power with which they were re&s;pectively indued were al&s;o arbitrary; for the law could as ea&s;ily have made one of them mark|ed <HI>five &s;hillings</HI> pa&s;s for <HI>five pounds,</HI> &s;ilver money of <HI>America,</HI> as it did for <HI>five &s;hil|lings</HI> of that coin. But the retaining of names, and the annexing to them differ|ent ideas from what they u&s;ually convey, amounts to an actual alteration of the names: It was therefore as nece&s;&s;ary that the bills &s;hould, <HI>at their fir&s;t emi&s;&s;ion,</HI> be endued with &s;uch powers as <HI>generally</HI> accompanied their re&s;pective denomina|tions, as to give them the denominations by which the people <HI>generally</HI> counted.</P>
<P>To fix the idea of paper-money it may be proper to &s;how wherein it differs from paper-credit. When credit is given for money, there is always a promi&s;e expre&s;&s;ed or implied for the payment of it; if expre&s;&s;ed, it is <HI>generally</HI> on paper; and from the&s;e circum&s;tances the latter kind of engagements where they are transferable by law or cu&s;tom, is called a paper-credit. But the paper-bills of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> as they do not promi&s;e money for <HI>any thing el&s;e,</HI> cannot be compre|hended under the notion of paper-credit. They are <HI>actually</HI> money, and may as properly be termed paper-money from the material of which they are made, as &s;ilver-coin is &s;o denominated from the metal. All a&s;&s;ignable notes promi&s;ing paper-coin are paper-credit on the &s;ame rea&s;on that notes promi&s;ing &s;ilver-coin are &s;o.</P>
<P>Forasmuch as the law, by which the <HI>Maryland-</HI> bills were i&s;&s;ued, <HI>in&s;ures</HI> to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, at <HI>certain</HI> periods, the quantity of &s;ilver expre&s;sed by them, they could only be regarded as paper-credit <HI>at their fir&s;t emi&s;&s;ion:</HI> But as they pa&s;s at a much higher rate than the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> of di&s;count allow, they are at pre&s;ent to be con&s;ider|ed as a mixture of paper-money and paper-credit. This la&s;t &s;upplies the place of ca&s;h, and according to the extent of it, is of more or le&s;s advantage to a coun|try where &s;ilver is the <HI>e&s;tabli&s;hed</HI> medium of commerce; that being a currency which
<PB N="5" REF="005308_0005_1016FA9FF7AA2328">
co&s;ts <HI>extremely dear.</HI> But where paper-money is u&s;ed, if there be a &s;ufficiency, the co&s;t of which is comparatively nothing, a paper-credit can be of little, if any &s;ervice at all.</P>
<P>We return to the law whereby paper-bills were fir&s;t introduced into <HI>Penn&s;yl|vania,</HI> and ob&s;erve that it gradually lo&s;t its efficacy, as the &s;ilver-contracts &s;ub|&s;i&s;ting at the time of pa&s;&s;ing it were paid off. The power of the bills would have &s;unk in the &s;ame degree, were not the people obliged, thro' the want of &s;il|ver, to u&s;e them as their medium of commerce. Now fora&s;much as they contract for 'em every day as they did before for &s;ilver, their worth is on as good a foun|dation as it was at their fir&s;t emi&s;&s;ion; for the pre&s;ent debtors are under as &s;trong a nece&s;&s;ity of purcha&s;ing 'em to di&s;engage their promi&s;es for that coin, as the former debtors were to di&s;charge their contracts for &s;ilver-coin; and therefore their worth cannot fall while trade continues to furni&s;h 'em with an employment equal to what it now does, as it always will unle&s;s their quantity be <HI>ra&s;hly</HI> encrea&s;|ed, or a better currency be introduced in their room, which &s;eems morally im|po&s;&s;ible: For even with re&s;pect to an independent government, which, by pru|dently prohibiting &s;ome and laying high duties on other kinds of foreign com|modities, may <HI>generally</HI> have &s;uch a quantity of &s;ilver as the trade of the country requires, for it may &s;ometimes have <HI>too much</HI> as well as too little; silver is never|thele&s;s a currency, not to in&s;i&s;t on the great co&s;t of it, much inferior to paper-money on &s;everal other <HI>important</HI> accounts; as will be demon&s;trated in the &s;equel. <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> mu&s;t, except in a few trifling in&s;tances, pay &s;ilver for all the goods imported from <HI>England,</HI> and cannot impo&s;e the lea&s;t duty on any of them. To attempt then to introduce that metal into the Province, as a medium of commerce, which in a dependent government, as <HI>Penn&s;ylvania is,</HI> will ever be a currency <HI>extremely precarious;</HI> and NEGLECT to improve and extend the pow|er of the paper-money, who&s;e advantages have been experienced during a peri|od of more than twenty years; would be a proceeding which I &s;hould confe&s;s my &s;elf at an utter lo&s;s to account for.</P>
<Q>Quidquid id e&s;t timeo Danaos &amp; dona fere<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">tes. <BIBL>Virg.</BIBL></Q>
<P>The principles on which the value of the currency of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> is &s;upported, <HI>undeniably</HI> evince, that, were the duty for purcha&s;ing the &s;ilver promi&s;ed to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of the <HI>Maryland-bills,</HI> to be di&s;continued, their pre&s;ent value could not be le&s;&s;ened: For the people of that Province would be then under the &s;ame obligation of purcha&s;ing 'em to di&s;charge their contracts as they are at pre|&s;ent; and would as willingly bargain for 'em afterwards as the people of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> do now for the bills current among&s;t them.</P>
<P>I would add farther, that if the &s;ilver-contracts at pre&s;ent &s;ub&s;i&s;ting among the former, were to be made payable in paper-bills, according to their varying worth in &s;ilver, which the cour&s;e of exchange di&s;covers, the employment and con&s;equently the value of 'em would be increa&s;ed (but I do not in&s;inuate it ought to be above what it is) much more than it would by making them a legal tender at a certain fix'd rate in di&s;charge of &s;ilver-contracts; for that is an ex|pedient
<PB N="6" REF="005308_0006_1016FA8CAF7CFF68">
which, after the bills have obtained a currency, cannot be introduced nor continued without danger; forasmuch as it has a <HI>direct</HI> tendency to force merchants into the truck-trade; which, in their own defence, they mu&s;t all run into, when they &s;ee the currency pour'd upon 'em without bounds. In &s;uch a ca&s;e none will fell their goods for it on credit, unle&s;s at a prodigious advance; and on the other &s;ide it will have but little employment in di&s;charging &s;ilver-contracts, for no new ones of that kind will be made; &s;o that under the&s;e circum&s;tances the wonder is not why it &s;hould in &s;ome colonies have &s;unk &s;o much in value, but rather how it could pre&s;erve any value at all.</P>
<P>The proprietary quit-rents in <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> re&s;erved &s;ince the u&s;e of paper-mo|ney, are made payable by the patents in &s;ilver, or the value in paper-coin, ac|cording to the cour&s;e of exchange. Tho&s;e re&s;erved before paper-money was in|troduced, which are &s;aid to be &s;mall compared with the others, the law regu|lates the payment of during a certain term of Years, at the rate of eighteen pence for one &s;hilling <HI>&s;terling.</HI> But to this the <HI>Honourable Proprietaries</HI> them&s;elves a&s;&s;ented in con&s;ideration of the &s;um of 1200l as appears by the publick proceed|ings.</P>
<P>The value of the paper-money of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> notwith&s;tanding the obvious manner of accounting for it, is attributed by many to the land-&s;ecurity on which it is lent; and, in &s;upport of this notion, the following argument, who|ever fir&s;t broached it, has been printed; which I &s;hall <HI>particularly</HI> examine <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> as it has been <HI>generally</HI> adopted, it cannot <HI>with defency</HI> be condemned in the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">.</HI> It runs thus. <HI>As tho&s;e who take bills out of the banks in</HI> Europe <HI>put in money for &s;ecu|rity, &s;o here we engage our land. And as bills i&s;&s;ued upon money-&s;ecurity are money, &s;o bills i&s;&s;ued upon land-&s;ecurity are, in effect, coined <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">.</HI> Now the Banks of <HI>Europe</HI> do ac|tually <HI>borrow</HI> the money lodged with them, and therefore <HI>give</HI> their notes as a &s;e|curity for the repayment&punc; But the paper-money-bank of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> to which the argument is applied, does not borrow but <HI>lend</HI> money, and therefore <HI>takes</HI> &s;ecurity from the borrowers for the repayment at the times &s;tipulated. The two ca&s;es then, in&s;tead of having the <HI>lea&s;t</HI> re&s;emblance, being <HI>e&s;&s;entially</HI> oppo&s;ite; it is impo&s;&s;ible that any conclu&s;ion drawn from the one &s;hould be applicable to the other. Indeed the bills given by an <HI>European</HI> bank have the &s;ame power as the &s;ilver promi&s;ed by 'em; becau&s;e the po&s;&s;e&s;sors have a <HI>right</HI> to receive, and do al&s;o receive on demand the very firms expre&s;&s;ed by &s;uch bills. But tho&s;e of <HI>Penn|&s;ylvania</HI> cannot, for a like rea&s;on, nor for any rea&s;on, be con&s;idered as land; for tho' they be lent upon land, yet the po&s;&s;e&s;sors have no <HI>right</HI> to demand from any man, or any body of men, any land for 'em.</P>
<P>Having &s;hown that the value of the paper-money depends on the <HI>general</HI> em|ployment given it by trade; we from thence de&s;cend to prove that the employ|ment, and con&s;equently the value of it, will, on a &s;uppo&s;ition of its quantity continuing the &s;ame, be more or le&s;s in proportion to the INTRINSIC WORTH of the <HI>moveable commodities</HI> exchanged by it.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="005308_0007_1016FAA631605D98">
When the&s;e encrea&s;e in quantity without dimini&s;hing in goodne&s;s or quality, or encrea&s;e in quality without dimini&s;hing in quantity; their <HI>intrin&s;ic worth is encrea&s;ed.</HI></P>
<P>The more any particular &s;ort of goods is wanted, the more hands will be em|ployed in rai&s;ing, making and tran&s;porting 'em to market for &s;ale and <HI>vice ver&s;a:</HI> From whence it follows, <HI>That the</HI> Intrin&s;ic worth <HI>of</HI> moveable <HI>commodities will be</HI> always <HI>proportioned to the labour and skill expended on the &s;everal &s;pecies,</HI> con&s;idered toge|ther, <HI>of which it is compo&s;ed.</HI></P>
<P>The value of the land belonging to a &s;ociety may fall tho' the people encrea&s;e, if their diligence decrea&s;es in a greater proportion, <HI>as may &s;ometimes</HI> happen. But the value of the land will <HI>infallibly</HI> ri&s;e with the <HI>intrin&s;ic worth</HI> of the moveable commodities; which may be occa&s;ioned by an increa&s;e of indu&s;try in the people as well as by an increa&s;e in their number. Therefore it is plainly the intere&s;t of land-holders and the owners of hou&s;es who propo&s;e a rent by them, to de&s;ire, a|bove all others, a plenty of money; for, without it, a great part of &s;ociety, who, with it, might be engaged to &s;et their hands to u&s;eful work, will remain un|employed; while others who&s;e livelihood depends on their manual labour, and who, on an offer of ready money would <HI>eagerly, con&s;tantly</HI> &s;trive to earn it, will not work but as mere nece&s;&s;ity compels them. Hence it clearly appears that land-holders are the <HI>natural</HI> guardians of the publick intere&s;t; &s;ince without advan|cing their own they cannot promote the other, nor &s;uffer it to be le&s;&s;ened with|out &s;uffering them&s;elves in an equal degree: Whereas merchants (or Mr. <HI>Locke</HI> is mi&s;taken) as well as u&s;urers or money-jobbers, land-jobbers and &s;uper-nume|rary officers, with their tribe of retainers and dependents, may all <HI>very po&s;&s;ibly</HI> grow rich, while the re&s;t of the community are oppre&s;&s;ed and kept poor. Yet becau&s;e it is the immediate intere&s;t of land-holders <HI>in general,</HI> to promote the public good, that therefore it mu&s;t always be the immediate intere&s;t of every one in <HI>particular;</HI> or, &s;uppo&s;ing it to be the ca&s;e, that <HI>therefore</HI> none of 'em will &s;acrifice <HI>a real</HI> advantage to a lu&s;t of power, when an opportunity of gratifying it pre|&s;ents; or to a de&s;ire of <HI>lording</HI> it over their brethren, tho' the pro&s;pect may &s;eem remote; is a fallacious way of arguing; tho' it is a doctrine that has <HI>formerly</HI> been currently &s;wallowed, <HI>to the great detriment of the patients,</HI> in a certain colony which I forbear to name.</P>
<P>And now craving pardon for this digre&s;&s;ion, I re-a&s;&s;ume the principal argument and pur&s;ue it thus;</P>
<P>Paper-money is only wanted to exchange commodities, which it does, whe|ther they be &s;old ab&s;olutely for it or only for a time, or whether the payment be immediate or time be given for the payment. Commodities are never exchang|ed unle&s;s they be wanted: Therefore the demand for paper-money mu&s;t ri&s;e and fall with the demand for the commodities (among which we mu&s;t here in|clude the land) exchanged by it.</P>
<P>If the <HI>intrin&s;ic worth of moveable</HI> commodities be not encrea&s;ed, neither rents nor the value of land can ri&s;e, nor, con&s;equently, the demand for money, to di&s;|charge the one or purcha&s;e the other:</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="005308_0008_1016FA8B2A14F300">
Neither, on the &s;ame &s;uppo&s;ition, can the continual variations in the value of <HI>moveable</HI> commodities, with re&s;pect to one another, encrea&s;e the demand for money; for it is <HI>impo&s;&s;ible</HI> that any of the &s;orts &s;hould ri&s;e unle&s;s the others fall. As then the demand and con&s;equently the value of the paper-money cannot be encrea&s;ed, &s;o it cannot be le&s;&s;ened, but in proportion to the <HI>intrin&s;ic worth</HI> of the <HI>moveable</HI> commodities exchanged by it. If the reader has not forgot, that when this inference was offered to be proved, it was on a &s;uppo&s;i|tion that the quantity of money in trade remain'd the &s;ame, he'll more clearly perceive the truth of the po&s;ition now laying down, to wit, That, could a me|thod be fallen upon to augment and dimini&s;h the quantity of the currency ac|cording to the demand for it; <HI>its value would remain&punc;</HI> UNALTERABLE; for as the proportion between the money extant and the intrin&s;ic worth of the <HI>moveable</HI> commodities exchanged by it, would be always alike; the &s;ame number of &s;hillings or pounds would at all times purcha&s;e the &s;ame quantity of <HI>labour and art,</HI> or of the <HI>nece&s;&s;aries and conveniences of life,</HI> taking one article with another; as for in&s;tance, &s;hould dome&s;tic commodities ri&s;e in price, with re&s;pect to pa|per money, they would do &s;o with re&s;pect to foreign goods, which mu&s;t there|fore fall proportionably; &s;o that when more money than u&s;ual is required for the one, le&s;s will &s;erve for the other. Thus, in every ca&s;e that can be put, the value of the money (&s;uppo&s;ing a con&s;tant proportion pre&s;erved between the quantity extant and the intrin&s;ic worth of the commodities exchanged by it) will, as it &s;tands in compari&s;on not with one or a few, but with all the commodities purcha&s;eable by it, be found <HI>unalterable;</HI> which is the <HI>highe&s;t pitch of perfection</HI> that money can arrive at; for beyond this point it is impo&s;&s;ible to carry it, with|out rendering invariable the natural and con&s;tantly variable relations of commo|dities to one another.</P>
<P>Now in order to pre&s;erve a <HI>con&s;tant</HI> proportion between the quantity of money floating in trade, and the demand for it, there needs nothing more than to open a bank that &s;hall lend on good real &s;ecurity for the <HI>natural</HI> intere&s;t, whatever &s;ums may be applied for; and &s;hall al&s;o receive back any &s;um, if not too tri|fling, from any per&s;on offering it, tho' not a borrower, allowing him the natu|ral intere&s;t or an equivalent to it, 'till he calls it out again.</P>
<P>An increa&s;e of trade will encrea&s;e the number of borrowers, and con&s;equent|ly the hire of money: Therefore the bank continuing to lend it out at the &s;ame intere&s;t it let for before that increa&s;e, will at once be enabled to augment the quantity accordingly. On the other hand a decrea&s;e in trade will decrea&s;e the number of borrowers, and con&s;equently the hire of money: Therefore the bank, continuing to give the &s;ame intere&s;t it let for before, mu&s;t <HI>inevitably</HI> draw in the part, which on every decrea&s;e of commerce, will be left without em|ployment; and thus the quantity&punc; of money floating in trade will be augmented and dimini&s;hed, <HI>exactly</HI> with the demand for it.</P>
<P>Admitting, <HI>for argument's &s;ake,</HI> the natural rate of intere&s;t to be five <HI>per cent</HI>&punc; a premium of four and a half will <HI>probably</HI> prove &s;ufficient to draw in the &s;u|perfluous
<PB N="9" REF="005308_0009_1016FABD63DDDAB0">
ca&s;h at any time extant; for &s;uch an intere&s;t when with if the princi|pal may be had on demand, is at lea&s;t as good as five <HI>per cent.</HI> on any private &s;ecurity, where be&s;ides the ri&s;que, the lender can never be &s;ure of having his money again, as he would be at the bank, whenever an opportunity offers of laying it out to greater advantage. Therefore &s;hould the full natural intere&s;t be|tween man and man be allowed by the bank for the money returned upon it; the quantity extant, in&s;tead of ever exceeding, will rather fall &s;hort of the proportion required by trade; which mu&s;t incline it to &s;ink in&s;tead of ri&s;ing in value. But this inconvenience may be ea&s;ily avoided by le&s;&s;ening the premium; which, without leaving it to the di&s;cretion of the managers of the bank, may be regulated by a <HI>perpetual</HI> table, that the men of figures will ea&s;ily form on the <HI>Data,</HI> furni&s;hed 'em by one year's experience. On the &s;ame <HI>Data,</HI> rules may be laid down for di&s;covering at all times the hire of money at market; for, as that le&s;&s;ens, the intere&s;t <HI>paid</HI> and <HI>received</HI> at the bank mu&s;t be le&s;&s;ened too. There can be no occa&s;ion to encrea&s;e it at any time for the natural intere&s;t between man and man (which, by the way, can never fall too low) will be always falling until every branch of trade be fully &s;upplied with money. The&s;e la&s;t hints may &s;eem &s;uperfluous to &s;uch as have duely re|flected on the nature of intere&s;t, as they really would be, were they added, <HI>on|ly</HI> on their account, to &s;trengthen this conclu&s;ion, <HI>That the Scheme it as</HI> ea&s;y <HI>in practice, as it is</HI> true <HI>in theory.</HI></P>
<P>The end of money is to facilitate the exchange of commodities, and therefore it is &s;ignificantly called <HI>an in&s;trument of commerce.</HI> It is the tool which mer|chants work with, and its deficiency in power does <HI>more immediately</HI> affect them than any other calling, becau&s;e their bu&s;ine&s;s con&s;i&s;ts in exchanging and di&s;tri|buting goods; for which rea&s;on Mr. <HI>Locke</HI> throws them together, from the highe&s;t to the lowe&s;t cla&s;s, under the general <HI>emphatical</HI> name of <HI>Brokers.</HI> Yet, however nece&s;&s;ary money may be to traders, they either will not (and with good rea&s;on) contract for a paper-currency when they <HI>apprehend</HI> it likely to fall&punc; or they'll rai&s;e the price of their goods according to the &s;trength of that apprehen&s;i|on; and in both ca&s;es the employment and value of the money will be le&s;&s;ened. While the&s;e jealou&s;ies exi&s;t its power cannot be extended; and unle&s;s they be removed, it will on every addition made to it, decrea&s;e fa&s;ter in value than it can be encrea&s;ed in quantity. But were this &s;cheme to be carried into execution, as no doubt it will, if the arguments before offered be found conclu&s;ive; &s;ellers, on the one hand, would be convinced <HI>the money could not fall in value,</HI> and buyers, on the other, that <HI>it could not prove deficient in quantity;</HI> which circum&s;tances <HI>concurring</HI> would <HI>immediately</HI> cau&s;e it to circulate thro' every vein of commerce, and <HI>at once</HI> blow up the truck-trade; a manner of traffick, which, whether it be from the difficulties it is accompanied with, or the opportunities it furni&s;hes <HI>artful,</HI> di&s;ho|ne&s;t traders in exchanging and di&s;tributing commodities to <HI>cheat</HI> the rai&s;ers, makers and con&s;umers of 'em, or on both accounts; has always been reckoned by every <HI>polite</HI> nation, where trade flouri&s;hed, a mark of BARBARISM.</P>
<P>Exchange fell lately in <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> from 145 l. to 125 l. and in a few months after ro&s;e to 165 l. which was owing to the &s;udden encrea&s;e and decrea&s;e of the
<PB N="10" REF="005308_0010_1016FAA816A27EA0">
trin&s;ic worth of the commodities that gave employment to the currency. But if its quantity had been augmented and dimini&s;hed accordingly, the price of &s;terling bills of exchange could not have ri&s;en or fallen but ju&s;t half as much as it did. And had the &s;um and power of the whole currency extant been the treble of what it was, when exchange was at 145 l. it could not have ri&s;en high|er than 147 &amp; <HI>a half</HI> nor fallen lower than 142 &amp; <HI>a half.</HI> I omit the demon|&s;tration here, for as much as the principles on which it is founded were de&s;cri|bed very particularly in one of the publick prints &s;ome months ago; and the con&s;equences flowing from thence were proved &s;o clearly, that &s;everal gentle|men, who think them&s;elves knowing in the theory of money, becau&s;e they can give them&s;elves leave to practice any <HI>unju&s;tifiable</HI> arts of getting it, were plea&s;ed to declare the writer gave him&s;elf an unnece&s;&s;ary trouble, &s;ince, as they affirmed the points he then undertook to demon&s;trate, were before his writing, as per&s;pi|cuous to them as the <HI>meridian</HI> &s;un.</P>
<P>An exact judgment cannot be formed of the &s;um of money nece&s;&s;ary for car|rying on the trade of any &s;ociety, tho' we knew the number of the individuals&punc; for people are not in all places equally indu&s;trious; neither can we arrive at any certainty in this matter, tho' we were acquainted with the annual quantity of their &s;everal kinds of labour; for when the members of a community are &s;ettled clo&s;e together, each will apply him&s;elf to one &s;ingle trade, which will cau&s;e a greater exchange of commodities than if they were &s;cattered on a large &s;urface <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> for then each would be obliged to follow &s;everal occupations at once, and &s;o <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> much le&s;s quantity of commodities would be exchanged. The running ca&s;h <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>England</HI> is computed at <HI>twenty millions,</HI> to which if we add the bank-notes and other paper-pledges that pa&s;s as ready money, which are therefore in this ca&s;e to be con&s;idered as part of the nation's ca&s;h, the whole cannot amount to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> than <HI>forty millions.</HI> This &s;um divided among <HI>ten millions</HI> of &s;ouls for &s;o many <HI>England</HI> is reckoned to contain, gives 4 l. for each. Now allowing there are in <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> 150,000 &s;ouls, their currency, if it was to be proportioned by that of <HI>England&punc;</HI> &s;hould be equal in power to 600,000 l. &s;terling. But abating the one half, for the rea&s;ons ju&s;t now offered, it follows that the 80,000 l. now ex|tant in <HI>Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> as it has not a greater power than 50,000 l. &s;terling, is but the &s;ixth part of what the trade of the province requires. But tho' this at the be&s;t is but <HI>probable</HI> if it be even that, yet it is <HI>certain</HI> that the currency of the co|lony is <HI>va&s;tly &s;hort</HI> of what its dome&s;tic trade will bear, &s;ince it is too evident the greate&s;t branches of it depend on barter only. Moreover as people cannot with|out great difficulty exchange their labour, if money which is the medium of ex|change be wanting, families are thereby drove to live independently of one a|nother, and to provide as much as po&s;&s;ible within them&s;elves whatever is ne|ce&s;&s;ary for their &s;upport. The plea&s;ures of &s;ociety having by this means lo&s;t the chief place in their thoughts, they &s;eek out land at the cheape&s;t rate. To this it is in a great mea&s;ure owing that his Maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects in <HI>America,</HI> including many who are born as well as others who annually arrive there, are daily re|tiring back in great numbers from the Sea, which renders 'em as u&s;ele&s;s to the colony as to their <HI>Mother-country,</HI> for &s;uch con&s;ume little or none of her manu|factures
<PB N="11" REF="005308_0011_1016FAA185AD6650">
On the other &s;ide, fora&s;much as people living clo&s;e together and ready at hand to a&s;&s;i&s;t one another can, if money be not wanting, more ea&s;ily ob|tain the nece&s;&s;aries and comforts of life than a like number more thinly &s;ettled; it is plain that a plentiful currency would render the &s;ubjects much more u&s;eful to <HI>Great-Britain</HI> and to one another than they now are, as they would thereby be &s;pontaneou&s;ly drawn into a narrower compa&s;s, to which in &s;uch a ca&s;e, they would be farther allured by the rational plea&s;ures that accompany a &s;ocial life. On the&s;e con&s;iderations one can hardly forbear thinking, that the paper-money of <HI>Penn&s;ylvania</HI> might in a few years attain a power equal to 300,000 l. &s;terling. And then &s;uppo&s;ing the exports and imports to be double of what they now are, and that the employment which they at pre&s;ent furni&s;h the paper-money in exchanging them &s;hould be even trebled; yet its variation in value compa|red with &s;ilver (which, as was mentioned once before, may for the mo&s;t part be exactly di&s;covered by the price of &s;terling bills of exchange) would be trif|ling. In the mean while its worth in that metal would, on this &s;cheme, <HI>taking one time with another,</HI> be invariable, or at lea&s;t not perceptible 'till after many years; for tho' a va&s;t quantity of &s;ilver and gold is daily dug out of the earth, and found on the &s;urface of it, yet it is exceedingly &s;mall with re&s;pect to the &s;um of both in the trade of the world; and therefore their <HI>declining</HI> worth cannot be ea&s;ily perceived on a &s;hort retro&s;pect.</P>
<P>In the next number it will be &s;hown, that the money cannot, con&s;i&s;tent with <HI>ju&s;tice</HI> and <HI>public honour,</HI> be lent out at le&s;s than the <HI>natural</HI> intere&s;t; nor that le&s;s than that intere&s;t, or an equivalent to it, can be refu&s;ed to &s;uch as &s;hall be di&s;po|&s;ed to return any part of it on the bank. In di&s;cu&s;&s;ing the&s;e points, not only the rea&s;onablene&s;s of the &s;cheme, but the nature and <HI>ine&s;timable</HI> advantages of a pa|per-currency will be further illu&s;trated.</P>
<P>Let liberty and property be &s;ecured ever &s;o well, yet the labour and indu&s;try of the people, from which the riches of every community are wholly derived, can|not be drawn forth to the length they are capable of, without a plenty of money. This con&s;idered, it may not be thought an extravagant a&s;&s;ertion, that a paper-currency mu&s;t <HI>nece&s;&s;arily,</HI> in proportion to the number of the individuals, prove to every &s;ociety u&s;ing it in the manner &s;et forth, <HI>a more valuable</HI> and a <HI>much more certain</HI> &s;ource of wealth, than the gold of <HI>Brazil</HI> is to <HI>Portugal,</HI> or than the inex|hau&s;tible &s;ilver-mines of <HI>Poto&s;i</HI> are to <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
