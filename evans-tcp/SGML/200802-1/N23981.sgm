<HEAD>EXTRACT FROM A PAMPHLET, ENTITLED, <HI>"Reflections on the Inconsistency of Man."</HI></HEAD>

<P>[Printed and Sold by J. Buel.]</P>
<P>IN the fir&s;t movements of the American Revolution, it was in&s;i&s;ted, and generally accepted as a given point, that all men by nature are equal; and this truth is the foundation of all Liberty. It was upon this principle, that our Conventions endeavor|ed to form both the State and Federal Con&s;titutions: But as eminent a monument of human wi&s;dom as the Federal Con&s;titution may be, it yet contains a certain clau&s;e, which the benevolent mind can never contem|plate, but with dete&s;tation.</P>
<P>"The migration, or importation of &s;uch per&s;ons as any of the States now exi&s;ting &s;hall think proper to admit, &s;hall not be prohibited by the Congre&s;s, prior to the year 1808." A &s;hort paraphra&s;e on this remark|able clau&s;e, perhaps may read nearly as follows:</P>
<Q>Although our Con&s;titution is built on principles, which have for their ba&s;is the perfect equality of man: Although we hold that freedom is the birth|right of every individual of the human race, what|ever
<PB N="35" REF="031720_0033_0FEE1BBF4A7F87D0">
may be his country, or his color: Although we maintain that no per&s;on has any legal authority over another, but what is derived from the voluntary con|&s;ent of the per&s;on over whom it is exerci&s;ed: Al|though we believe that when one per&s;on attempts to u&s;urp authority over another, that it is not only the right, but the duty of the injured per&s;on to re|&s;i&s;t: Although we hold that tyranny is the greate&s;t of cur&s;es and vices; and that liberty is the greate&s;t of ble&s;&s;ings&mdash;Yet we believe, that the Negroes of Af|rica, becau&s;e they are black, and we are white&mdash;be|cau&s;e it is nece&s;&s;ary for us to live in genteel refine|ment, at the expen&s;e of the mi&s;ery of the &s;tupid negroes&mdash;becau&s;e liberty and property are our rights, and ne|ce&s;&s;arily extingui&s;h theirs: We therefore maintain it to be perfectly right and ju&s;t, to keep them and their chil|dren to langui&s;h in hopele&s;s bondage, without the lea&s;t right or title to the profits of their labor, or the liberty of their per&s;ons; and that whenever they make the lea&s;t attempt to re&s;i&s;t our authority, or to regain their liberty, to puni&s;h them, or put them to death, as the ca&s;e may require. And that whereas there are not enough of the&s;e wretched victims in the United States, this land of liberty and equality; (Though there are near &s;even hundred thou&s;and) we will not prohibit, but will virtually gurantee the &s;lave trade, that is we will allow our merchants and our &s;ailors to go to the defencele&s;s &s;hores of Africa, and either by fraud or violence, or whatever way you can, &s;eize upon the wretched natives, (though as innocent as to any injury they ever did us, as the an|gels are in Heaven) take fathers, aged trembling fa|thers,

from their wretched &s;tarving children!&mdash; Weeping children, from their agonizing parents!&mdash; Hu&s;bands from their &s;hrieking, di&s;tracted wives!&mdash; Wives from the embraces of their tender wi&s;hful hu&s;bands! Lover and friend, from his wi&s;hed for mate! Take them men, women and children, load them with irons, and crowd them promi&s;cuou&s;ly into a &s;tifled &s;tinking hole. There feed them on their pa&s;&s;age with the bread of affliction&mdash;if they are &s;ullen perhaps you may knock them in the head, and throw their mangled bodies to the &s;harks! When you have arrived in the free zone of America, that a&s;&s;ylum of the oppre&s;&s;ed, immediately adverti&s;e that you have a cargo of human beings for &s;ale; when the purcha|&s;er arrives, let him examine them as critically, and with as much decency as if they were oxen, or cows, then let him take them to his plantations, and a&s;&s;ign to each his burden. Let them toil ince&s;&s;antly in in the burning &s;ummer's fun. Let them &s;hiver with naked|ne&s;s in the rigorous and inclement winter. Let the cruel the unfeeling ta&s;k-ma&s;ter rai&s;e them by the break of day, with the crack of his whip. Let its di&s;cipline be extended over them during the day, and for a &s;mall fault or mi&s;take, let their backs be 'whipt to a jelly. Let the aged female while bending over her &s;pade, and worn out with enormous hard|&s;hips, be &s;purred on to a nimbler pace by the cruel whip. Let a &s;mall portion of Indian corn, a few yams or potatoes, be their principal food, whil&s;t ema|ciated with hunger, and exhau&s;ted by cea&s;ele&s;s and 'n&s;upportable labor, 'til death the often implored 'and mo&s;t welcome me&s;&s;enger, preaches to them the principles of equality indeed.</Q>
