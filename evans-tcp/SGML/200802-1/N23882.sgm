<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>HAD the following collection of papers been more complete, it would have afforded double &s;atis|faction to the Compiler. The &s;ucce&s;s of this attempt has however convinced me of the great utility of undertaking.</P>
<P>As <HI>facts</HI> are the ba&s;is of human knowledge, it is of great importance to collect them. There are proba|bly in every profe&s;&s;ion, facts enough which occur <HI>every year,</HI> in an exten&s;ive country, to con&s;titute a ma&s;s of information, if collected, equal to what a long life of experience would be nece&s;&s;ary to acquire for any <HI>one man.</HI> If not collected, the&s;e u&s;eful facts are lo&s;t to all the profe&s;&s;ion, except to a few individuals; if col|lected, they conden&s;e the knowledge of a <HI>whole life</HI> into the compa&s;s of a <HI>few hours reading.</HI> This might be done every year; and what could be more u&s;eful?</P>
<P>Though not a Phy&s;ician, I have been accu&s;tomed to Philo&s;ophical inquiries, and feel a deep intere&s;t in the pro&s;perity of my country and the happine&s;s of my fellow-citizens. I am per&s;uaded that the Americans may be convinced by <HI>facts,</HI> that even in our climate, Epidemic and Pe&s;tilential Maladies may be generated by local cau&s;es. If they can be convinced of this, that &s;ources of di&s;ea&s;e and death may be found among them&s;elves created by their own negligence, it is a great point gained; for until they learn this, they will never attend to the means of pre&s;erving life and health. They will &s;till wallow in filth, croud their cities with low dirty hou&s;es and narrow &s;treets; neglect the u&s;e of bathing and wa&s;hing; and live like &s;avages, devouring, in hot &s;ea&s;ons, undue quan|tities of animal food at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">eir tables, and recling home after midnight debauches.</P>
<P><PB REF="031593_0004_0FED504277059DF8">If they can &s;ettle this point with them&s;elves, that danger may exi&s;t at home, &s;ome per&s;ons may profit by the conviction. Our police at any rate may be wholly changed, and the mode of building our cities, undergo a thorough alteration.</P>
<P>I have to make my acknowledgments to the Gen|tlemen, who have favored me with their communica|tions. Tho&s;e who have neglected my applications, doubtle&s;s have good rea&s;ons for it; tho&s;e who have treated this undertaking with contempt, have my mo&s;t hearty forgivne&s;s.</P>
<P>I have been &s;olicited to adverti&s;e for &s;imilar com|munications, the next year, and am a&s;&s;ured, that more numerous papers may be expected. But I have nei|ther inclination nor lei&s;ure to devote much time to this object; nor am I convinced that the object it&s;elf will reward a continuance of my labors.</P>

<HEAD><HI>(CIRCULAR.)</HI> To the Phy&s;icians of Philadelphia, New-York, Baltimore, Norfolk and Newhaven.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS a malignant fever has, for three &s;ummers pa&s;t raged in different parts of the United States, and proved fatal to great numbers of our fellow-citi|zens, and extremely prejudicial to the Commerce of the Country, it becomes highly important to take &s;uch efficacious &s;teps as human wi&s;dom can devi&s;e to prevent the introduction, arre&s;t the progre&s;s, or miti|gate the &s;everity of &s;uch a &s;erious calamity. It is a cau&s;e equally intere&s;ting to every part of the United States; and one that deeply affects the happine&s;s of families, and the general pro&s;perity of the country.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t mea&s;ure to be taken in this bu&s;ine&s;s &s;eems to be, to a&s;certain the following points&mdash;Whether the bilious remitting fever, commonly called the Yellow Fever, is of foreign or dome&s;tic origin; whether it is always imported or <HI>may</HI> be generated in our own coun|try; whether it is an epidemic, or depends for propaga|tion on &s;pecific contagion; or whether it partakes of the nature both of an epidemic and a contagious di&s;|ea&s;e.</P>
<P>The&s;e points, however clear to many of the fa|culty, are &s;ubjects of warm controver&s;y among others; and while profe&s;&s;ional men differ in opinion, other ci|tizens will differ al&s;o; and while a difference of opi|nion exi&s;ts as to the origin and nature of the di&s;ea&s;e, no legi&s;lative remedies, no effectual police-regulations can be expected for the prevention of this calamity.</P>
<P><PB N="vii" REF="031593_0006_0FED504A2268BF10">To decide on the origin and nature of the Yellow Fever, we want the <HI>evidence of facts;</HI> the&s;e have oc|curred in the United States, &s;ufficient in number and clearne&s;s, to furni&s;h evidence that &s;hall produce uni|ver&s;al conviction, if all tho&s;e facts were brought toge|ther and offered to the Public in a ma&s;s.</P>
<P>If the gentlemen of the faculty will take the trouble to furni&s;h me, &s;everally, or by committees, with &s;uch facts as have fallen under their notice, relative to the foregoing points, I will be at the pains to arrange them, and will ri&s;k the publication and circulation of the work throughout the United States.</P>
<P>In an undertaking of this kind, private intere&s;t ought not to be wholly abandoned; but my princi|pal motive, is to promote the be&s;t intere&s;ts of my fel|low citizens, by doing what few men will undertake: that is, collecting the fragments of knowledge which lie &s;cattered in various places, and arranging and publi&s;hing them for the common benefit of my country.</P>
<P>The particular points on which I wi&s;h to obtain information, are the following:</P>
<P>The <HI>origin</HI> of the yellow fever in the re&s;pective places to which you belong&mdash;the time of its appear|ance and di&s;appearance&mdash;its &s;ymptoms and, the mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful mode of treatment&mdash;what proportion of per&s;ons &s;eized with decided &s;ymptoms of this fever have died&mdash;how far the fever has been attended with &s;pecific contagion, and the proofs of this&mdash;in what &s;ituations as to free air, water, &s;treets and buildings, this di&s;ea&s;e has been mo&s;t fatal&mdash;what de&s;criptions of people have &s;uffered mo&s;t, and their mode of living&mdash; what malignant complains have, for two or three &s;ea&s;ons, preceded the yellow fever&mdash;how it differs in
<PB N="viii" REF="031593_0007_0FED504BDD97AB18">
&s;ymptoms from the ordinary bilious fever of the coun|try&mdash;whether or not you have known a fever, with the &s;ame or &s;imilar &s;ymptoms, to occur in &s;cattered in&s;tances, in other &s;ea&s;ons than that in which the yel|low fever has prevailed&mdash;and whether &s;uch ca&s;es can be traced to any known cau&s;e&mdash;and in &s;hort, plea&s;e to communicate any other information which, in your opinions, may throw any light on the origin, nature and cure of the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>The Health Committees of the Cities above men|tioned, are particularly reque&s;ted to furni&s;h &s;uch facts, on any of the&s;e points, as may have come to their knowledge.</P>
<P>The Phy&s;icians of Newbern, Edenton, Wilming|ton and other towns in North-Carolina; of Charle&s;ton and Beaufort in South-Carolina; of Savanna or other large towns in Georgia; and the Phy&s;icians on the ea&s;tern &s;hore in Virginia, Maryland and Delaware, together with tho&s;e of Alexandria, Richmond, Pe|ter&s;burgh, or other large towns in the &s;outhern &s;tates where bilious fevers prevail, are reque&s;ted to com|municate &s;uch facts and ob&s;ervations relative to tho&s;e fevers, as may enable the public to judge how far the ordinary remitting bilious fever of our country corre&s;ponds in origin and &s;ymptoms, with the fatal epidemic which has raged in Philadelphia, New-York, &amp;c.</P>
<P>A &s;imilar reque&s;t is made to Phy&s;icians in every part of the United States, e&s;pecially in the neighbor|hood of the drowned land, and at Shawangunk in the &s;tate of New-York, and tho&s;e who have had the care of tho&s;e per&s;ons who were taken with a malignant
<PB N="ix" REF="031593_0008_0FED504F258CA3F0">
fever at the treaty with the Indians near lake Cayuga, the &s;ummer pa&s;t.</P>
<P>The Phy&s;icians about Cox&s;ackie, the drowned lands in Sali&s;bury in Connecticut, and Sheffield in Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, and who attended the &s;ick in the neigh|borhood of the mar&s;hy ground on the borders of tho&s;e towns&mdash;in &s;hort, all Phy&s;icians who have had expe|rience in bilious fevers of a malignant kind, are re|que&s;ted to communicate whatever facts can throw light on the origin, nature, or cure of &s;uch fevers.&mdash; They are reque&s;ted to inform, in what &s;ea&s;ons the fe|vers prevail mo&s;t, whether wet or dry&mdash;at what time in &s;ummer they appear and di&s;appear&mdash;at what di&s;|tance from a mar&s;h they prevail, to determine the ex|tent of the contagious influence ari&s;ing from low grounds&mdash;whether the water is running or &s;tagnant&mdash; whether &s;uch fevers ever prevail near fre&s;h water ponds, who&s;e banks are high and rocky, and the mar|gins of which do not abound with gra&s;s and weeds&mdash; whether the putrid fevers ari&s;ing evidently from mar&s;h-exhalations in the country are ever attended with &s;pecific contagion&mdash;in &s;hort, every &s;pecies of facts that can &s;erve to explain the cau&s;e, the progre&s;s, and the &s;ymptoms, of bilious fevers.</P>
<P>It is reque&s;ted that your an&s;wers to the&s;e inquiries may be forwarded to me at New-York as &s;oon as convenient, and by private conveyance, if po&s;&s;ible. I am per&s;uaded that a full inve&s;tigation of the cau&s;es of the di&s;ea&s;e, will enable the government of our &s;tates and cities, to make &s;uch regulations as to guard our commercial towns from a repetition of the cala|mities they have once &s;uffered. If the di&s;ea&s;e has been imported, more effectual mea&s;ures mu&s;t be taken to prevent its introduction&mdash;if generated in our own

country, it is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for our populous towns to &s;uffer mo&s;t deci&s;ive amendments, in their docks, hou&s;es, &s;treets, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Our latitudes are the &s;ame as many countries in A&s;ia, where the plague rages; and perhaps our cli|mate, which formerly re&s;i&s;ted the progre&s;s of fatal epidemics, is a&s;&s;imilating it&s;elf annually to that of Smyrna and Con&s;tantinople.</P>
<P>I cannot but hope, gentlemen, that you will be of opinion that this &s;ubject is of great and univer&s;al con|cern to the United States; and that you will con&s;ent to aid a plan which has the health of our fellow-citi|zens, and the happine&s;s and pro&s;perity of our coun|try for its object.</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE utility of accurate Hi&s;tories of Epidemics to the improvement of medicine, has never been doubted from the time of the early and valuable pub|lications of Hypocrates, to the late and no le&s;s judi|cious ob&s;ervations of Dr. Ru&s;h: but as the Yellow Fever has been &s;o accurately and fully de&s;cribed and treated of by &s;everal phy&s;icians in the We&s;t-Indies, in Philadelphia, &amp;c. it may be thought entirely &s;uper|fluous to give any account of it as it appeared in this city. Fully &s;en&s;ible of the force of this remark, I long declined attempting any thing of the kind; but as &s;everal facts have occurred to me, a general know|ledge of which I con&s;ider as highly intere&s;ting to hu|manity and of importance to the community at large, and e&s;pecially to the inhabitants of this city, I am finally induced to &s;ubmit them to the con&s;ideration of the public, particularly as the Medical Society, which had made &s;ome progre&s;s in the bu&s;ine&s;s, have declined the pro&s;ecution of it.</P>
<P>THE many accounts and complete de&s;criptions al|ready given of this di&s;ea&s;e, &s;eem to render it unne|ce&s;&s;ary to enter into a minute detail of its &s;everal &s;ymptoms in this place; I have therefore been very &s;hort upon that pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t of the &s;ubject, referring the more

nice inquirer to the before mentioned authors, particu|larly to Dr. Ru&s;h's account of it, as it appeared in Philadelphia, in 1793, where he will find its various appearances very particularly and accurately deli|neated.</P>
<P>As the following ob&s;ervations have originated al|mo&s;t entirely from facts and circum&s;tances of the di&s;|ea&s;e, as it appeared in this city; the reader will find him&s;elf much deceived, if he looks for references to long catalogues of eminent authors, or for an elabo|rate account of the di&s;ea&s;es of the We&s;t-Indies, pe&s;|tilences of Europe, or plagues of A&s;ia: and as my conclu&s;ions are drawn chiefly from ca&s;es and occur|ances, that have come within my own per&s;onal know|ledge, (which favored by my local &s;ituation in the center of the Epidemic, and my providential pre&s;er|vation from its influence, till it was nearly extingui&s;h|ed, were con&s;iderably numerous) he will al&s;o find that my remarks have not been much either influ|enced or &s;upported by the uncertain communication of my brother practitioners or other citizens; hence, if decided and undoubted facts, &s;hall hereafter appear which &s;hall di&s;prove them, my error &s;hould be a&s;&s;ign|ed only to my general &s;ceptici&s;m re&s;pecting current medical reports, and the limited nature that I have impo&s;ed upon my &s;ources of information.</P>
<P>As &s;ome thoughts which I have advanced, are de|cidedly oppo&s;ed to the <HI>common &s;en&s;e</HI> of the faculty in

general, I wi&s;h it to be con&s;idered, that they are not the offspring of any favorite theory, or influential hypothe&s;is; for I had heretofore been taught and be|lieved very differently, till the &s;tubborn obtru&s;ion of facts upon my mind, forced me to change my opi|nion.</P>
<P>I AM well aware of the lo&s;s of reputation that I may &s;u&s;tain, from attempting, in the cour&s;e of this e&s;&s;ay, to &s;upport opinions which are very unpopular with the inhabitants of this city; however, the im|portance of the &s;ubject, has &s;wallowed up all per&s;o|nal con&s;iderations, and determined me freely to com|municate what I con&s;ider as highly e&s;&s;ential to their welfare; and I &s;hall be richly paid, if my temerity &s;hall in the lea&s;t degree, tend to the prevention of a di&s;ea&s;e, which in its <HI>partial</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It being chiefly confined to a particular part of the city.</NOTE> operation, in le&s;s than three months, &s;wept off upwards of &s;even hundred of our fellow-citizens; which &s;hould be &s;ufficiently alarming to put us upon our guard in future, for &s;hould it again ari&s;e, in a &s;ea&s;on more favorable to its &s;preading, perhaps its more <HI>univer&s;al</HI> deva&s;tation will not be checked till it has numbered thou&s;ands in its mortal li&s;t.</P>

<P>The common <HI>remitting bilious fever,</HI> was no ways uncommon in the &s;ummer months, but this al&s;o gave way, or rather perhaps, run into the <HI>yellow fever,</HI> as that gained ground in the city.</P>
<P>As early as the &s;ixth of the <HI>&s;eventh month,</HI> I was called upon in conjunction with Dr. Treat, then health-officer to our port, to vi&s;it Thomas Fo&s;ter, a patient brought into the alms-hou&s;e, whom we found affected with all the full marked and decided &s;ymptoms of an highly <HI>malignant yellow fever;</HI> the adnata of his eyes and his &s;kin were of a bright yel|low, the latter covered with purple &s;pots, his mind deranged, his tongue covered with a dry black &s;or|des, with hemorrhages from his gums and no&s;e, and a di&s;charge of black and very offen&s;ive matter from his &s;tomach and bowels; he died on the ninth.</P>
<P>Dr. Treat was taken on the 22d of the <HI>&s;eventh month,</HI> and died on the 30th. Several other un|doubted ca&s;es occurred, about this time, in the neigh|borhood of Dover-&s;treet, but the fir&s;t one that came under my particular ob&s;ervation, was that of James Dalton on the 12th of the <HI>eighth month,</HI> then in the fifth day of his illne&s;s, of which he died the day fol|lowing as yellow as gold. From this time the di&s;|ea&s;e became more and more frequent; yet as we find by the accurate accounts of the Health Committee, not above two a day upon an average died of it, till the 24th of the month.</P>

the forepart of the <HI>ninth month,</HI> became &s;o alarming as to drive many of the mo&s;t opulent of their inhabit|ants to the country, while the le&s;s prudent and the more indigent remained expo&s;ed to a di&s;ea&s;e, which, from this limited &s;pot, in le&s;s than three months, car|ried as many as five hundred to their graves.</P>
<P>The di&s;ea&s;e was not, however, confined <HI>entirely</HI> to this part of the city; for in every other &s;ituation, favoring the accumulation of filth and &s;tagnation of putrefactive materials, there it was no &s;tranger: it raged with peculiar violence in the vicinity of a mo&s;t intolerable pent up &s;ink, to the we&s;t of Peck-&s;lip, which is the receptacle for all the refu&s;e kitchen arti|cles, and yard wa&s;h of a number of lots fronting Pearl and Water-&s;treets, that back upon it; it was like|wi&s;e very prevalent in the neighborhood of the Fly-market, al&s;o in and about Skinner-&s;treet, as well as in &s;ome of the unregulated grounds on the north &s;ide of the town.</P>
<P>If an account of the epidemic, as it pervaded the different parts of the town, could be accurately a&s;|certained, and depicted in colors, heightened in pro|portion to the combined early time of attack, and the numbers affected blazoned by its comparative ma|lignity, there can be no manner of doubt, but that the low ground in the &s;outhea&s;t of the city as above mentioned, would appear as the grand center of the calamity, diffu&s;ing its effects, like diverging rays, to the adjacent parts; aiding by its mo&s;t powerful influ|ence, different &s;econdary centers, already &s;moking hot, to flame out its pe&s;tiferous operations. The ma|ny &s;olitary ca&s;es of the di&s;ea&s;e that have occurred in di&s;tant healthy &s;ituations, appear to have been kin|dled up by imprudent individual expo&s;ures too near the&s;e &s;ources of infection.</P>

By report of Dr. S. L. Mitchell, in behalf of a com|mittee of the Manumitting Society of this city, it ap|pears that not a &s;ingle &s;cholar of the free black &s;chool, under their patronage, died with it.</P>
<P>Several circum&s;tances tended to render the di&s;ea&s;e particularly fatal to the more indigent part of &s;he community: 1&s;t. The higher prices of hou&s;e-rent in the other parts of the city, having concentered a great proportion of them in the epidemic neighborhood, and crouded them in very &s;mall confined apart|ments; a number of hou&s;es contained as many fa|milies as it had rooms in it. 2d. Their poverty not permitting them to quit their place of re&s;idence when the di&s;ea&s;e came around them. 3d. The great difficul|ty of getting nur&s;es, and their exorbitant prices pre|venting them from getting proper attendance before their &s;ituation became known to the Committee of Health, often-times a whole family being taken down about the &s;ame time, their panic &s;truck fair-day friends quitting them in their di&s;tre&s;s, from the fear of infection. 4th. The neglect of obtaining early medical a&s;&s;i&s;tance, from a hope that their di&s;ea&s;e was not the prevailing one: and 5th. The refu&s;al of ma|ny, after they were taken ill, thus mi&s;erably &s;ituated, to go to Belle Vue, "le&s;t (to u&s;e their own expre&s;&s;ion) they &s;hould catch the Yellow-Fever and die."</P>
<P>Foreigners who came from a more temperate cli|mate, as the Engli&s;h, Iri&s;h, Scotch, &amp;c. and people from the country, who had not long re&s;ided in town, were particularly obnoxious to this complaint.</P>

<HEAD>Symptoms of the di&s;ea&s;e, as exhibited in the different parts and functions of the body.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1&s;t. <HI>The vital functions</HI> &s;uffered extremely in the fir&s;t attack of the di&s;ea&s;e, it generally coming on with <HI>chillne&s;s,</HI> an anxious and interrupted <HI>re&s;piration,</HI> with a total <HI>ab&s;ence of per&s;piration;</HI> this however, in &s;ome in&s;tances, came on very copiou&s;ly, after the great heat that generally followed the chill, had exi&s;ted for a time, but in mo&s;t ca&s;es the &s;kin continued dry and parched, except a &s;weat was induced by artificial means.</P>
<P>The <HI>pul&s;e</HI> was as variable as the hues of the ca|meleon; in mo&s;t ca&s;es it was frequent, and after the chill had &s;ub&s;ided, it became &s;omewhat hard: vet in|&s;tances occurred of a preternatural &s;lowne&s;s. I met with one ca&s;e in a black man, where it beat only for|ty-two &s;trokes in a minute; and in another per&s;on there was a complete intermi&s;&s;ion of it in every twelfth or fifteenth pul&s;ation: and in other patients,

particularly in the 3d or 4th day of their complaints, were phy&s;icians to judge from the pul&s;e alone, they would declare them in a convale&s;cent &s;tate, at the very time they were in the mo&s;t imminent danger and &s;ometimes within a few hours of their end. Al|though I firmly believe with my mo&s;t eminent teach|er Dr. Ru&s;h, that the pul&s;e is our be&s;t guide in the knowledge of di&s;ea&s;es, yet in no complaint that has ever occurred to my ob&s;ervation, have I found this mo&s;t &s;ure index of the &s;tate of the &s;y&s;tem, &s;o little to be depended on. <HI>Hemorrhages</HI> from the no&s;e, gums, &s;tomach, uterus, &amp;c. were very common at the com|mencement, as well as in the more advanced peri|od<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of this di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P N="2">2d. In the ANIMAL FUNCTIONS this di&s;ea&s;e in its fir&s;t attack, produced <HI>la&s;&s;itude,</HI> and an aver&s;ion to all kind of bodily exertion with a &s;en&s;e of general <HI>debil|ity,</HI> attended with violent pains in the head and back, &s;ometimes &s;hooting down the legs: the&s;e fre|quently preceded the chills, and in mo&s;t ca&s;es ac|companied it and continued afterwards, as a very di&s;tre&s;&s;ing &s;ymptom of the di&s;ea&s;e.

<P N="3">3d. No part of the body appeared to &s;uffer more than the NATURAL FUNCTIONS, which includes the alimentary canal and &s;ecretions. The <HI>&s;tomach,</HI> as in

all fevers, was affected with a degree of nau&s;ea, and &s;ometimes vomiting at the fir&s;t acce&s;&s;ion of this di&s;|ea&s;e, which frequently &s;ub&s;ided for a while, but is &s;ucceeded about the third day, if proper means are not u&s;ed to prevent it, by an almo&s;t unconquerable irrita|bility and retrograde movement of this organ, throw|ing up large quantities of green or yellow bile, and re|jecting immediately every particle of medicine, food or drink, that was taken into it&mdash;afterwards di&s;charging an aquoeus fluid containing a number of light dun co|lored &s;pecks in it; this, if not checked, was followed by a puking of a fluid exactly re&s;embling coffee, with its grounds floating in it, which by &s;tanding, would &s;ettle to the bottom.</P>
<P>The vomiting which occurs about the third day, frequently, is the only di&s;tre&s;&s;ing &s;ymptom that the patient labors under, his pul&s;e becoming natural, &s;kin cool and moi&s;t, with an entire freedom from pain, and a perfect clearne&s;s in the mental opera|tions, that in&s;uperable circum&s;tance &s;tanding alone, as it were, to humble the pride of phy&s;ic, and to warn, in cool blood, the unhappy &s;ufferer of his precarious exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>A <HI>hiccoughing</HI> often was very trouble&s;ome in the dif|ferent &s;tages of this complaint. The <HI>bowels</HI> were very uniformly and ob&s;tinately <HI>co&s;tive:</HI> there were &s;ome ca,+&s;es it is true, that were attended with frequent evacu|ations, but the&s;e generally &s;eemed rather of a partial dy&s;entery nature, and not free di&s;charges from the whole cour&s;e of the inte&s;tines.</P>
<P>The <HI>&s;ecretion</HI> of <HI>bile</HI> was greatly increa&s;ed, as ap|peared by its copious di&s;charge from the &s;tomach in vomiting, as well as from the bowels when excited by proper purgatives. The flow of &s;aliva and excre|tions from the mouth and &s;auces were not much im|peded;

in the beginning the <HI>tongue</HI> appearing moi&s;t and a little white, after a few days it became more thickly furred and a&s;&s;umed a deeper hue, but fre|quently in the latter &s;tages it became quite dry and covered with a black cru&s;t.</P>
<P>The appearances on the <HI>&s;uperficies</HI> were various, the <HI>&s;kin</HI> oftentimes retained its natural appearance, but frequently, though not uniformly, as the di&s;ea&s;e advanced, it a&s;&s;umed a yellow tinge. Mu&s;quetoe bites, which before had entirely di&s;appeared, &s;hewed them|&s;elves in all the parts that had been expo&s;ed to them, in &s;mall purplei&s;h red &s;pots; the&s;e were often taken for <HI>petechia,</HI> which &s;ometimes, but more rarely ap|peared.</P>
<P>Un&s;eemly &s;cabs, oftentimes in the latter &s;tages, formed about the mouth, which, on being &s;cratched off, frequently were followed by trouble&s;ome little hemorrhages. The&s;e eruptions did not in this fever as it does in others, indicate any favorable event of the complaint.</P>
<P>The <HI>adnata of the eyes,</HI> in the beginning where the attack was &s;evere, generally were tinged and &s;uffu&s;ed with a reddi&s;h color, changing with the &s;kin to a yel|low, as the di&s;ea&s;e advanced: there were many, how|ever, even among tho&s;e who died, who&s;e &s;kin nor eyes &s;hewed the lea&s;t appearance of this color.</P>

<HEAD>DIAGNOSIS.</HEAD>
<P>If it &s;hould be e&s;tabli&s;hed, that this fever is as highly contagious as is, perhaps, too generally believed, its diagno&s;is or peculiar &s;ymptoms di&s;tingui&s;hing it from others, would become a matter of the greate&s;t im|portance, both to individual &s;afety and to the wel|fare of the community at large.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="031593_0026_0FED5084ABFDC7A0">This part of the &s;tudy of medicine has, of late, been con&s;idered of le&s;s con&s;equence than formerly, &s;ince the fallacy and imprudence of pre&s;cribing for the name of a di&s;ea&s;e, has been &s;o fully expo&s;ed and ju&s;tly condemned by the generality of phy&s;icians;&mdash; however, in this particular complaint, as the hopes of a cure depend, almo&s;t entirely, upon the means u&s;ed in the fir&s;t two or three days of its attack, it certainly mu&s;t be of prime nece&s;&s;ity to know it in its early &s;tage. We cannot be too careful in detecting the exi&s;tence of this di&s;ea&s;e, for in its commence|ment, its evident &s;ymptoms are oftentimes no way in proportion to the danger. Hence, as Dr. Jack&s;on ob&s;erves, (in his treati&s;e on the fevers of Jamaica) <Q>per&s;ons unacquainted with the nature of the di&s;ea&s;e, would be di&s;po&s;ed to believe that the patient ex|pre&s;&s;ed &s;ufferings that were not real.</Q> And hence phy&s;icians are &s;ometimes led to neglect them till it is too late to &s;ave their patients.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t &s;tage of this fever it is oftentimes with difficulty di&s;tingui&s;hed from the common bilious re|mittent, its &s;ymptoms in general being exactly &s;imi|lar, only aggravated in degree; the pain in the head and back are more &s;evere and con&s;tant, and the re|mi&s;&s;ions, whenever they are ob&s;ervable, are more ob&s;cure; Tho&s;e who are well acquainted with the di&s;ea&s;e, may often recognize it by a certain unde&s;|cribeable appearance in the countenance of the &s;ick, the eye is often more red, and the face more flu&s;hed than the heat of the body and the general action of the &s;anguiferous &s;y&s;tem, would lead us to expect.</P>
<P>The remarkable irritability of the &s;tomach, that generally comes on (when the di&s;ea&s;e is permitted to run an uninterrupted cour&s;e) about the third or fourth day, whereby a con&s;tant nau&s;ea and retchings
<PB N="12" REF="031593_0027_0FED508668B81E38">
to vomit, immediately brings up every thing as &s;oon as &s;wallowed, &s;eems to be a pretty di&s;tingui&s;hing mark of this di&s;ea&s;e at this &s;tage of it.</P>
<P>The yellow &s;kin, and coffee ground or black vomit|ings, as they &s;ometimes occur in the more advanced &s;tage, may be looked upon as decided and unequivo|cal evidences of this complaint; but they cannot be con&s;idered as <HI>pathognomic &s;ymptoms,</HI> for although they are to be found in this fever only, yet in the great|e&s;t proportion of ca&s;es they do not attend it.</P>
<P>The prevailing epidemic &s;hould always have a great influence in fixing our judgment with re&s;pect to this, as well as other di&s;ea&s;es. Whenever it is found, from decided ca&s;es, that it really exi&s;ts in any particular &s;ituation, I &s;hould con&s;ider every fever, in that neigh|borhood, attended with aggravated &s;ymptoms of a common bilious remittent, to be of this kind; for I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e the powerful operation of its cau&s;e, would certainly predominate over the milder cau&s;es of more moderate maladies.</P>

<HEAD>PROGNOSIS.</HEAD>
<P>The progno&s;is is to be drawn from the di&s;po&s;ition and con&s;titution of the per&s;ons affected, as well as from the particular &s;ymptoms. Tho&s;e who had been much debilitated by previous di&s;ea&s;e, great anxiety of mind, drunkenne&s;s, &amp;c. mo&s;t generally admitted of but an unfavorable pro&s;pect as to the event of this di&s;ea&s;e, as likewi&s;e did the re&s;olute and hardy, who would not early &s;ubmit to their complaints, but en|deavored to &s;hake them off as they would a common catarrh. I u&s;ed to warn &s;uch ones at my fir&s;t vi&s;its, that I feared from their di&s;po&s;itions, that they would undertake to wre&s;tle with their di&s;ea&s;e, and that if they did they would &s;urely fall under it, and unfor|tunately
<PB N="13" REF="031593_0028_0FED508F1B264970">
their conduct too often verified my fears and ju&s;tified my progno&s;tic.</P>
<P>In the early &s;tages of the complaint, if it came on very moderately, without much affection of the head, if the eyes and countenance were not much affected, and the bowels were ea&s;ily moved by the medicines hereafter to be mentioned, we, in general, were war|ranted in pronouncing a favorable termination. But when the face and eyes were &s;uffu&s;ed with a reddi&s;h tinge, or great di&s;tre&s;s and anxiety were expre&s;&s;ed in the countenance, with &s;evere pain in the head and back, we had great cau&s;e to fear the con&s;equences, particularly if the bowels were ob&s;tinately con&s;tipat|ed; this la&s;t circum&s;tance, in every in&s;tance, por|tended the greate&s;t danger; indeed, it &s;eemed to me that the degree of danger was, very generally, in proportion to the &s;tubbornne&s;s of the con&s;triction of the&s;e vi&s;cera and their in&s;en&s;ibility to the impre&s;&s;ion of purgative medicines.</P>
<P>In the latter &s;tages of the complaint, when the con&s;tant vomiting came on, there was always great danger to be apprehended; yet &s;ome have recovered after di&s;charging the coffee ground like matter before-mentioned, but the&s;e ca&s;es were confe&s;&s;edly very rare.</P>
<P>The other &s;ymptoms of putre&s;cency, as a black tongue, petichiae, &amp;c. were generally unfavorable, although I did not find hemorrhages &s;uch terrible occurences as they are, by the generality of authors, &s;tated to be.

gums, &s;tomach or uterus, and one who had lo&s;t &s;ome blood from an accidental wound in his head; the&s;e were all the patients that I had attended, who had been affected with any hemorrhage what|ever, neither of them had died, three had recover|ed, and the other three were much better than they had been.</Q>&mdash;The&s;e three al&s;o afterwards recovered; neverthele&s;s, &s;ome patients afterwards died, who&s;e complaints were attended with hemorrhages; &s;till the&s;e facts prove that they do not indicate &s;o much danger as is commonly believed.</P>
<P>Having given a cur&s;ory account of the &s;ea&s;on im|mediately preceding and during the continuance of the di&s;ea&s;e, and al&s;o a hi&s;tory of its mo&s;t material &s;ymptoms, together with the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential circum|&s;tances re&s;pecting its diagno&s;is and progno&s;is, I pro|ceed to &s;tate &s;ome facts and free thoughts relative to a que&s;tion, in my opinion highly intere&s;ting to the cau&s;e of humanity, and greatly important to the community, for on it depends the welfare of the af|flicted individual, as well as the method of prevent|ing or eradicating the di&s;ea&s;e in general, viz.</P>

<P>In the year 1793, during the prevalence of this di&s;ea&s;e in Philadelphia, &s;everal per&s;ons who had lately come from that place, &s;ickened with it and died in this city, yet in no in&s;tance did they commu|nicate it to others, although, they were carefully and con&s;tantly attended.</P>

<P>At our city alms-hou&s;e, two per&s;ons died of this di&s;ea&s;e, which they mu&s;t have taken from going into that part of the town where it prevailed, as they both frequented that neighborhood, yet in neither ca&s;e did they communicate the complaint to a &s;ingle one either of their attendants, or of their numerous com|panions that were crouded in the &s;ame room.</P>
<P N="4">4th.

How different was this from what happen|ed in the city; there it obliged all di&s;ea&s;es to partake of its nature, and to pay obei&s;ance to the ruling power: (Ru&s;h's account of the yellow fever) it &s;eems as if tho&s;e patients had been protected for a time, by their di&s;ea&s;es, from the influence of the cau&s;e of the de&s;tructive epidemic, till they had gained a happy re|treat from the contaminated boundaries of the town.</P>
<P N="5">5th. Some contagions are communicated by con|tact only, as &s;yphilis, itch, &amp;c. others may operate at a certain di&s;tance through the medium of the air, as the &s;mall-pox, mea&s;els, &amp;c. yet all, that we have accurate knowledge of, are the mo&s;t certainly effect|ive <HI>ceteris paribus</HI> in an inver&s;e proportion to the di&s;|tance of the body from whence they ari&s;e, and <HI>vice ver&s;a.</HI> From this con&s;ideration, we cannot conceive any thing more certain of producing the di&s;ea&s;e in que&s;tion, than the handling the bodies of tho&s;e who have died with it, that is, if we &s;uppo&s;e it to be cau&s;ed by effluvia ari&s;ing from per&s;ons already affect|ed; yet we find di&s;&s;ections of &s;uch ones have been performed, by Dr. Mitchel in Virginia, Dr. Mac|krittrick in the We&s;t-Indies, Drs. Fleming and Jack|&s;on in Jamaica, Dr. Lining in Charle&s;ton, &amp;c. and they all have lived afterwards to publi&s;h an account of them: in Philadelphia, Drs. Phy&s;ick and Ca|thrall did the &s;ame, and Dr. Annan attended the di&s;&s;ection of others, and although it is very probable, that they, from living in the atmo&s;phere of that city,
<PB N="19" REF="031593_0034_0FED509FADF4C158">
may have had the di&s;ea&s;e, yet we do not find that their hardy expo&s;ures have augmented its violence &s;o much in them, as to enroll their names in the re|gi&s;ter of deaths. Dr. Baily di&s;&s;ected a per&s;on dead with this di&s;ea&s;e in this city, and &s;uffered no inconve|nience from it: but what would &s;eem &s;till more ex|traordinary, Dr. Deveze and all his &s;urgical a&s;&s;i&s;tants entirely e&s;caped the di&s;ea&s;e, notwith&s;tanding he opened a great number of bodies, and con&s;equently was under the nece&s;&s;ity of dipping his hands in their black and corrupted blood, and of breathing the in|fected vapor that exhaled from them. Who could &s;uppo&s;e it po&s;&s;ible for any one who never had had the &s;mall-pox, to have &s;uch clo&s;e connection with per|&s;ons in every &s;tage of that complaint, and even to handle their bodies after death, and e&s;cape being af|fected with it?</P>
<P N="6">6th. Specific and acknowledged contagions, all &s;eem to ari&s;e from them&s;elves only: hence it would be almo&s;t as hard for me to believe that the &s;yphilis, &s;mall-pox, or mea&s;les, could be produced from any other cau&s;e, than from their proper virus, obtained from per&s;ons affected with the like di&s;ea&s;e, as it would be for me to conceive of the formation of a plant, without having received its &s;eed or radical from one of the &s;ame nature. Contagions &s;eem to fix in the &s;oil of our bodies, and there &s;eed, and from thence &s;pread them&s;elves as naturally and regularly as vegetables do on the earth. But the yellow fever has been pro|duced from other cau&s;es than contagion.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lind's e&s;&s;ay on di&s;ea&s;es incident to Europeans in hot cli|mates, has many facts in proof of this di&s;ea&s;e being produced by other cau&s;es, and without the aid of contagion. Al&s;o note p. 16.</NOTE> Does it not then admit of a doubt whether it can po&s;&s;e&s;s a power of propagating it&s;elf? I confe&s;s I am almo&s;t
<PB N="20" REF="031593_0035_0FED50A1715574A0">
ready to believe, that it either is always produced by contagion, or never. It is very difficult to conceive, that two &s;uch different cau&s;es, &s;hould produce exact|ly &s;imilar effects.</P>
<P N="7">7th. It is an acknowledged fact with re&s;pect to contagions in general, that they are no re&s;pectors of per&s;ons, but that all of every clime and color, un|der like circum&s;tances, are equally &s;u&s;ceptible of their operations. But this is not the ca&s;e with the cau&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e under our pre&s;ent con&s;ideration: I have already ob&s;erved, in the hi&s;tory of the com|plaint, that the French people from the We&s;t-Indies, although involved in the mid&s;t of the epidemic, uni|ver&s;ally e&s;caped it. The &s;ame remark was made with re&s;pect to them in Philadelphia in 1793, (Ru&s;h's ac|count of the yellow fever). Dr. Jack&s;on (Treati&s;e on the fevers of Jamaica) ob&s;erves, <Q>that this di&s;ea&s;e &s;eldom di&s;covers it&s;elf among tho&s;e people who have lived any length of time in a tropical coun|try,</Q> and that <Q>it has never been ob&s;erved, that a negro immediately from the coa&s;t of Affrica, has been attacked with this di&s;ea&s;e; neither have cre|oles who have lived con&s;tantly in their native coun|try, ever been known to &s;uffer from it.</Q> The&s;e circum&s;tances certainly &s;hould tend to make us he&s;i|tate in pronouncing this fever contagious.</P>
<P N="8">8th. It is generally ob&s;erved of contagious di&s;|ea&s;es, that they have a determinate period of inva&s;ion after an expo&s;ure to their cau&s;e: thus, if a thou&s;and per&s;ons under &s;imilar circum&s;tances, &s;hould be ex|po&s;ed to and receive the infection of the &s;mall-pox or the mea&s;les, at the &s;ame time, they would gene|rally be taken with the complaint within a few hours one of another; but in this di&s;ea&s;e, this would be pinning the matter too clo&s;e; the &s;upporters of its con|tagious
<PB N="21" REF="031593_0036_0FED50A4D006F378">
nature, find their doctrine requires that it mu&s;t be permitted to act at any time, between that of the expo&s;ure and the &s;ixteenth day, otherwi&s;e it would not embrace ca&s;es enough to give it a curren|cy. This &s;eems to be allowing them&s;elves great la|titude, as there are but few per&s;ons during the pre|valence of an epidemic in their neighborhood, that avoid every kind of connection or near approach to the di&s;ea&s;ed for as much as &s;ixteen days together. Might not intermittents, when they occur generally in the vicinity of mill-ponds and mar&s;hes, as well be con&s;idered contagious, &s;ince few, I apprehend, could be found among &s;uch patients, but that had &s;ome time or other, and generally within two or three weeks, been near them that had that complaint, or to &s;omething that might have imbibed &s;ome effluvia from them? It may be &s;aid, that although there are but <HI>few</HI> ca&s;es, &s;till there are <HI>&s;ome</HI> who have agues and fevers that never have been within the reach of febrile effluvia from an affected per&s;on: I an&s;wer, &s;o are there of the pre&s;ent complaint; few phy&s;i|cians who have had an exten&s;ive practice in this city, can be &s;trangers to the occurrence of &s;ingle in&s;tances of it without any other ca&s;es exi&s;ting, that could be &s;u&s;pected of having communicated it to them. (See page 19, note 16.)</P>
<P N="9">9th. Contagions act more or le&s;s at all places and &s;ea&s;ons, &s;imply of them&s;elves without the aid of any particular circum&s;tance of air or climate; but the &s;up|porters of the yellow fever being contagious, are oblig|ed by the force of the foregoing ob&s;ervations to ac|knowledge their imaginary fondling, at be&s;t, but a half formed mon&s;ter, and perfectly inactive without being a&s;&s;i&s;ted by <Q>the concurrence of a predi&s;po&s;ing con&s;ti|tution of the air.</Q> (Ru&s;h on yellow fever) This fever exi&s;ts only in warm weather; hence its cau&s;e in
<PB N="22" REF="031593_0037_0FED50A68DFB0A60">
this city was perfectly extingui&s;hed by the fro&s;ty nights in the 10th month. It is confined mo&s;tly to low &s;ituations, in thick &s;ettled places; otherwi&s;e our alms-hou&s;e and the &s;urrounding country would have &s;adly experienced its deleterious effects.</P>
<P>Let us examine a few ca&s;es which are &s;uppo&s;ed decidedly to have been cau&s;ed by contagion. Dr. Malachi Treat, is &s;aid to have taken the fever from a per&s;on in a ve&s;&s;el that he was on board of the day before his indi&s;po&s;ition; his complaints might as well have been a&s;&s;igned to having vi&s;ited a patient in the Alms-hou&s;e &s;eventeen days before. But I cannot con|ceive why he &s;hould be &s;ingled out as a fatal victim of the effluvia of this man's body, merely from a mo|ment's vi&s;it, while all his room-mates and continued attendants, univer&s;ally e&s;caped any inconvenience: nor do I know any rea&s;on why Dr. Treat might not have taken his complaints from the &s;ame cau&s;e as this patient did; and he was &s;ick and died &s;everal days before the arrival of any of the ve&s;&s;els, &s;uppo&s;ed to have brought the &s;eeds of the di&s;order to this city. Daniel Phoenix, the city trea&s;urer, is &s;uppo&s;ed with|out doubt, to have taken his complaints from conta|gion: the corporation, &s;ome time pa&s;t, having i&s;&s;ued into circulation, for the accommodation of the in|habitants, a great number of paper penny bills, it has been concluded that he mu&s;t have received contagion, through the medium of &s;ome bundles of the&s;e bills, which he opened, that had been brought to him, af|ter having been &s;oiled and nearly worn out, to be ex|changed, and which he opened and examined to a&s;|certain their amount &s;ome days after he had received them: the probability of tho&s;e having conveyed con|tagion, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Although it is very po&s;&s;ible, that he might have taken his complaint from the effluvia, that aro&s;e from the&s;e bills, highly loaded with putrefactive materials that they had collected from the hands through which they had circulated, rendered active by their being packed up together in great numbers and confined for a time in a clo&s;e che&s;t before they were opened, &s;till it puts them only upon a par with (and in my opinion corroborates the idea of the di&s;ea&s;es being cau&s;ed by) putrefactive effluvia in ge|neral, and is far from proving them to have conveyed contagious particles from per&s;ons laboring under &s;uch a particular di&s;ea&s;e.&mdash; (See definition of contagion, p. 28.)</NOTE> cannot be very &s;triking, when we reflect,
<PB N="23" REF="031593_0038_0FED50AE4E120530">
that he was one among the fir&s;t of tho&s;e that were taken. Whence then could the bills have gathered the infection to give to him? we cannot &s;uppo&s;e them to have come from the We&s;t-India i&s;lands; but even if his indi&s;po&s;ition and like circum&s;tances &s;hould have occured at a more advanced period of the epidemic, it would not to me, appear to be a very likely method of communicating contagion; for per&s;ons in that &s;tage of the di&s;ea&s;e, which is believed to be the mo&s;t infectious, &s;eldom have much to do with handling money, or even of wearing &s;uch clothes as have pockets in them, that might po&s;&s;ibly have contained &s;ome. It may be ob&s;erved, he lived in a part of the town that &s;oon after &s;uffered much by this com|plaint.</P>
<P>Dr. William M. John&s;on's ca&s;e, is publi&s;hed in proof of the fever being communicated by conta|gion; (Daily Adverti&s;er, Vol. 2, No. 3343) but I cannot conceive whence the author derives his au|thority for a&s;&s;erting that his complaints "have actu|ally happened in con&s;equence of intercour&s;e with the &s;ick." It is true, he had previou&s;ly been in compa|ny with per&s;ons that had the di&s;ea&s;e, but he al&s;o re|&s;ided in New-York before he was &s;tationed at Belle-Vue, he con&s;equently mu&s;t have been expo&s;ed to the &s;ame general cau&s;e of the epidemic, as his &s;uffering neighbours were; and from inquiry, I find he had
<PB N="24" REF="031593_0039_0FED50B00D5D72A0">
not left town but a few days previous to his being taken ill.</P>
<P>Frederick Steymets, one of the Committee of Health, &s;uppo&s;ed his complaint to be the effects of contagion, received by examining &s;ome papers that had belonged to a patient that died at Belle-Vue ho&s;|pital. Is it probable, that the&s;e papers, which per|haps had not been within ten feet of the patient after his di&s;ea&s;e had put on &s;uch a &s;erious a&s;pect, &s;hould imbibe and convey the cau&s;e of his complaint three or four miles, while the effluvia ari&s;ing directly from his body, had no effect upon tho&s;e who were con&s;tantly about him, and performing the mo&s;t me|nial and loath&s;ome &s;ervices for him? This valuable citizen's activity and per&s;everance in the noble cau&s;e of humanity, often led him in the mo&s;t &s;ickly parts of the city; whence, more probably, his complaints mu&s;t have originated.</P>
<P>The <HI>"po&s;itive facts"</HI> in&s;i&s;ted on by Dr. Lind, (Di&s;ea&s;es incident to Europeans in hot climates, page 195) I con&s;ider as very exceptionable proofs of the contagious nature of this fever, for although an in|fected per&s;on came on board one of the &s;loops of war which lay in the river Gambia, two or three days be|fore the &s;ickne&s;s began in them, yet it is very likely they would have been &s;ick at the &s;ame time had he not come on board, as they had not been but eight or ten days in that river, for the &s;ame author ob&s;erves that &s;ymptoms of indi&s;po&s;ition in &s;ome in&s;tances, do not occur till twelve days after having received a taint from the land air. Robert&s;on's ca&s;e (p. 195) is by no means conclu&s;ive; the little &s;pa&s;modic &s;hock that he &s;u&s;tained, being, no doubt, an accidental occur|ance; which, had it happened at any other time, per|haps never would have been noticed; his being taken
<PB N="25" REF="031593_0040_0FED50B1E6659318">
with a fever &s;oon after, proves nothing but that the feeling the pul&s;e of a per&s;on dying, did not prevent him from getting a like complaint from the operation of cau&s;es that had been previou&s;ly applied. Nor is what occured on board the Merlin &s;loop (page 196) more &s;atisfactory: all the conclu&s;ion that I can draw from them, is, that different cla&s;&s;es of the men, were taken earlier or later with their complaints, accord|ing as they had been more or le&s;s expo&s;ed to the noxious land air.</P>
<P>To the&s;e remarks may be added the ob&s;ervation of the experienced Dr. Hunter, (Di&s;ea&s;es of the ar|my in Jamaica) when &s;peaking of the yellow fever, that "It is a matter of &s;ome con&s;olation in the hi&s;to|ry of &s;o grievous a di&s;ea&s;e, to be able to &s;ay with cer|tainty, that it is not contagious."</P>
<P>It has been &s;aid, and I &s;u&s;pect with too much truth, that were all the phy&s;icians in this city to a&s;&s;ert, that our late autumnal epidemic was not contagious, they would not be able to make the people in general be|lieve them, &s;ince &s;o many think they are well ac|quainted with decided proofs of its being &s;o. This, however, will not carry a full conviction to the minds of the more con&s;iderate and rea&s;onable part of the community, &s;ince the mo&s;t popular opinions are not always the mo&s;t ju&s;t. I &s;uppo&s;e were all the faculty in America to unite, and declare their di&s;belief in the power of the imagination to mark the <HI>foetus in utero,</HI> that they could not per&s;uade the generality of women, but that, cro&s;&s;ed appetites, un&s;atisfied cravings, and frightful &s;ights, will patch their offspring with roa&s;t pig, plumb cakes, &s;trawberries, &amp;c. or give them hare lips, &s;tain them with bloody &s;pots or &s;omething of the kind; for mo&s;t of them fancy they have facts enough within their own knowledge, fully to &s;up|port

I an&s;wer, perhaps from no better foundation than the popular belief in witchcraft aro&s;e, in a part of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts about one hundred years ago, as well as in different parts of Europe &s;ometime before, i. e. from the credulous fears of the people, worked up|on by the erroneous opinions and publications of in|fluential per&s;onages<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hutchen&s;on's E&s;&s;ay concerning Witchcraft.</NOTE>. Nineteen per&s;ons were exe|cuted in and about Salem in 1692 from this demoni|acal delu&s;ion, and no doubt, but ten times that num|ber have been &s;hamefully permitted to die of the yel|low fever in Philadelphia<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Carey's Account of the Malignant Fever in Philadel|phia, 1793.</NOTE> and New-York, in con&s;e|quence of neglect from the fear of contagion, when perhaps the unhappy &s;ufferers, were as free from the power of afflicting their friends, as the New England witches were.</P>

<HEAD>The Cau&s;e of the Fever, and the mo&s;t probable method of preventing its return: likewi&s;e, the Precautions to be u&s;ed to avoid an Attack, if it &s;hould again become Epidemic.</HEAD>
<P>On the &s;ixth of Augu&s;t, 1795, I received a note from John Broome, Chairman of the Committee of Health, <Q>earne&s;tly &s;oliciting me to give them every aid in my power, by my prudent advice, &amp;c. for the accompli&s;hment of the important end of their in&s;titution.</Q> In con&s;equence of which, a few days after, I made him the following communica|tion.</P>
<P><Q>That a malignant fever exi&s;ts among us, is a me|lancholy certainty, well-known to the Committee of Health; that this fever, in it&s;elf, is of a danger|ous nature, there can be no doubt; but whether it is contagious or not, is a que&s;tion yet undetermin|ed. I have not known or heard of a &s;ingle well atte&s;ted proof, of any per&s;on taking the complaint from another that was affected with it.</Q></P>
<P><Q>My <HI>advice</HI> is, that the Committee, while they continue their unremitted and benevolent exertions, in preventing the introduction of infectious di&s;ea&s;es from abroad, &s;ettle not in a fal&s;e &s;ecurity, and neg|lect the cau&s;es of di&s;ea&s;es that may exi&s;t in the ci|ty. It is from the unguarded operations of the&s;e inwalled enemies, that I conceive we have to appre|hend the greate&s;t danger.</Q></P>
<P><Q>If I have been rightly informed, a great propor|tion of the per&s;ons, that have at this &s;ea&s;on been affected with fevers of a &s;u&s;picious nature, has been
<PB N="33" REF="031593_0048_0FED50CBB65A6DC0">
confined to tho&s;e who&s;e re&s;idence or occupation has obliged them to pa&s;s a con&s;iderable part of their time between Peck-&s;lip and the New-&s;lip. If &s;o, it certainly is a matter of con&s;equence, to know, whe|ther in this part of the city, there is not &s;ome local cau&s;e that may induce &s;o fatal a malady.</Q></P>
<P><Q>That putrifying &s;ub&s;tances, after a continuation of very warm weather, will give ri&s;e to &s;uch com|plaints; the fatal operation of the dock mud de|po&s;ited at Peck-&s;lip in 1791, the putrid coffee in Philadelphia in 1793, and the noxious exhalations from the creek in New-Haven in 1794, &s;ufficiently prove, without the aid of many other equally cer|tain, though more remote facts, that might be ad|duced in its &s;upport if nece&s;&s;ary.</Q></P>
<P><Q>On the&s;e principles I have been led to &s;earch into this part of the town, for the cau&s;e of the pre&s;ent complaint, and I believe my inquiries have not been in vain: I &s;u&s;pect that I have di&s;covered a fruitful matrix generating the &s;eeds of this complaint, and which if not properly cared for, may po&s;&s;ibly &s;pread mortality in its vicinity.</Q></P>
<P><Q>A few years ago the Corporation have had Wa|ter-&s;treet, between the two beforementioned &s;lips, filled up, without obliging the proprietors of the property on the north &s;ide of the &s;treet and in Cherry-&s;treet, to fill up their yards even to a level with it. Hence, the refu&s;e water and offal &s;ub|&s;tances, from the families occupying the&s;e places, are left to &s;tagnate and putrify; and what renders it particularly di&s;tre&s;&s;ing, is, that the healthful &s;how|ers, that in general wa&s;h away all &s;uch matters from other places, here only tend to render them more active; for by the water not runing off, it di&s;&s;olves
<PB N="34" REF="031593_0049_0FED50CD73C02B40">
and prepares them, thus pent up, for entering into their pe&s;tilential fermentation. Our regular and heavy rains, perhaps have been one great remote cau&s;e of the frequency of the&s;e di&s;tre&s;&s;ing di&s;ea&s;es, in this neighborhood at this &s;ea&s;on.</Q></P>
<P><Q>It may be worthy of remark, that many of the&s;e tenements contain &s;everal families; hence an addi|tional cau&s;e for putrefactive materials.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I make no apology for giving the&s;e hints to the Committee; the impre&s;&s;ion of their importance on my mind, rendering it a duty: the hurry of an ear|ly communication, amid&s;t frequent profe&s;&s;ional in|teruptions, mu&s;t an&s;wer for their incorrectne&s;s.</Q></P>

</LETTER>
<P>The cau&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e as above &s;ugge&s;ted, not be|ing removed, its effects, in full &s;upport of my appre|hen&s;ions, truly <Q>&s;pread great mortality in the vici|nity,</Q> as is &s;een by its hi&s;tory in the foregoing ob|&s;ervations.</P>
<P>This early idea of the origin of the epidemic, con|&s;tantly gained confirmation from the manner in which it increa&s;ed: it appeared to be almo&s;t entirely confined to the level &s;outh-ea&s;tern part of the town, and there it was the mo&s;t general and fatal, in the particular &s;ituations that mo&s;tly abounded with the&s;e
<PB N="35" REF="031593_0050_0FED50D3ACAEB498">
pools of putrefactive exhalations. Thus it fir&s;t be|came the mo&s;t general in and about the lower end of Dover-&s;treet: this is what might rea&s;onably be looked for when we con&s;ider that be&s;ides all the lots fronting this &s;treet being &s;unk beneath the common level of it, there are al&s;o on the docks at its lower end &s;everal &s;tore-hou&s;es and granaries, built partly over the water on piles, without having the &s;pace under them filled up; the foundation of &s;ome of them, on the &s;ides fronting the water are partitioned up &s;o as to prevent the free circulation of the tide from wa&s;hing away any thing from under them; however, the&s;e partitions were not &s;o tight but that they let in water &s;ufficient to favor the fermentation of the putrefactive materials that &s;uch a common receptacle will always collect, not only from exterior &s;ources, but al&s;o from the &s;howers of grain that frequently would pour down through holes that the rats &s;ometimes would gnaw in the floor. Hence there can be no wonder, that the &s;eeds of this di&s;ea&s;e &s;hould ripen in &s;uch a hot bed of putrefaction, aided by the effluvia emited from the great flats of mud in the &s;everal &s;urrounding impaired docks, left bare during the rece&s;s of every tide. It is remarkable that &s;everal per&s;ons employed in a large grain &s;tore-hou&s;e, thus &s;ituated over &s;uch a &s;ource of noxious mia&s;mata, were among the fir&s;t victims of this di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>The di&s;ea&s;e &s;oon increa&s;ed; numbers were taken in every part of that quarter of the town, lying be|tween the upper part of Water, Pearl and Chatham-&s;treets, and acro&s;s to the lower part of George-&s;treet. From an attention to the &s;ubject not only during the hurry of the epidemic, but al&s;o &s;ince its extinction, I am led to believe according to my be&s;t judg|ment, that four fifths of all the lots in this af|fected part of the city, were &s;ituated below the level
<PB N="36" REF="031593_0051_0FED50D56C6F84D0">
of the &s;treets they fronted, whence from our regular rains, they very generally became &s;tagnant, putrid mud puddles. I can hardly think it po&s;&s;ible, was it not for the ob&s;truction of the hou&s;es preventing a free ob&s;ervation of the&s;e grounds, that any candid per&s;on acquainted with the common cau&s;es of fevers, could harbor the lea&s;t doubt after walking through this part of the town, but that the epidemic originated from this &s;ource, rendered active by the con|tinued exce&s;&s;ive heat of the &s;un during the la&s;t &s;um|mer. It raged with peculiar violence in the parts that were near the docks; this is what might be expected from the additional vapor of the dock mud as above-mentioned. It al&s;o was very fa|tal in a part of George-&s;treet, <Q>not le&s;s than &s;ixty per&s;ons were buried out of it within the &s;mall com|pa&s;s of twenty hou&s;es.</Q> This was probably owing to the poi&s;onous &s;teams di&s;charged from large quan|tities of &s;treet dirt and manure, collected during the &s;ummer and depo&s;ited near the head of it, &s;ubjoined to the common cau&s;es above-mentioned. Its fatality to the We&s;t of Peck-&s;lip was induced, no doubt, by the noxious vapors from the putrid &s;ink there. The rea&s;on of its prevalence about the Fly-market, can &s;eem no ways &s;trange to any one acquainted with the &s;ituation of that place, the market being built over an offen&s;ive &s;ewer, who&s;e exhalations were confined only by an imperfect board floor, to which may be added, the effluvia con&s;tantly ari&s;ing from the putre|fying animal and vegetable matter all around, as well as from the &s;lip that puts in at it. Skinner-&s;treet is lowly &s;ituated, unpaved and very imperfectly drain|ed.</P>
<P>That putrefactive effluvia will give ri&s;e to, and are the common cau&s;e of &s;uch di&s;ea&s;es, is clearly proved by the accurate ob&s;ervations of the mo&s;t judicious wri|ters

on the di&s;ea&s;es of hot climates. Lind's valuable book of intere&s;ting facts (E&s;&s;ay on the Di&s;ea&s;es of hot climates) abounds with proofs of this di&s;ea&s;e be|ing cau&s;ed by the air from the low lands in the We&s;t Indies; he particularly mentions, that it often raged in the Greenwich Ho&s;pital at Jamaica; which, as he ob&s;erves, was unfortunately built near a mar&s;h, and that it could not proceed from any &s;ource of infec|tion in the ho&s;pital. Dr. Hunter &s;ays (Di&s;ea&s;es of the army in Jamaica) &s;hips lying at Port Royal in Jamaica, on moving and taking their &s;tation higher up the harbor, have in a few days become &s;ickly. <Q>The men, &s;ays he, have been &s;eized with fevers owing to the low &s;wampy lands along &s;hore, and at the head of the harbor, from which la&s;t the ex|halations are carried every morning towards the &s;hips, when the regular &s;ea breeze &s;ets in, as is perceived by the bad &s;mell which accompanies it.</Q> He &s;ays that there are examples, where out of &s;ixty or &s;eventy men, employed in filling the water ca&s;ks, not one has e&s;caped a fever, from the watering place being wet and &s;wampy. The &s;ame author ob&s;erves, that Fort Augu&s;ta, which was at other times a &s;alubri|ous &s;ituation, became &s;ickly in 1783, the &s;ea that year having ri&s;en higher than u&s;ual, &s;o that it <Q>overflowed the whole of the ground on which the fort &s;tands, near a foot above the &s;urface in &s;ome places, and on ebbing left much &s;lime and ouze. A few days after this, many of the men were taken with fevers.</Q> Dr. Jack&s;on (Treati&s;e on the Di&s;|ea&s;es of Jamaica) as well as a ho&s;t of other authors, might be brought if nece&s;&s;ary, to prove that putrid exhalations are the common cau&s;es of epidemics. The above facts, together with the many others ad|duced by Dr. Ru&s;h (Account of the Yellow Fever &amp;c.) in their &s;upport, appear to me to be &s;ufficient

<P>Many of the &s;trenuous &s;upporters of the conta|gious nature of this di&s;ea&s;e, compelled by the force of the foregoing circum&s;tances, acknowledge, that the di&s;ea&s;e may be cau&s;ed by other means, however they cannot <HI>entirely,</HI> give up this favorite opinion, but per&s;i&s;t in a&s;&s;erting that contagion often does in|duce the di&s;ea&s;e, when the foregoing &s;tate of the air favors its operations; and they defy any one to prove that it does not. To prove a negative is al|ways difficult, &s;uch a one, perhaps impo&s;&s;ible. But &s;ince the only proof we can have of the exi&s;tence of a cau&s;e, is the nece&s;&s;ity of it for producing known effects, and &s;ince we are to admit, (according to Newton's fir&s;t philo&s;ophic precept) no more cau&s;es than are &s;ufficient to explain the appearances, and, as has been ob&s;erved, (Pemberton's view of Newton's philo&s;ophy) <Q>When one cau&s;e is &s;ufficient, if there really &s;hould in nature, be two, which is in the la&s;t degree improbable, we can have no po&s;&s;ible means of knowing it, and con&s;equently ought not to take the liberty of imagining, that there are

<P>The mo&s;t probable means of preventing a like ca|lamity in future will be&mdash;1&s;t, To have all the lots, particularly in the low parts of the town, filled up, &s;o as to afford a &s;ufficient de&s;cent to carry off the water into the &s;treets, and not permit any of it to &s;tagnate in them. 2d, To have the dirt and filth in the &s;treets and yards more carefully and frequently cleared away. 3d, To have the docks repaired and regu|lated in &s;uch a manner, as not to permit the mud to gather and be expo&s;ed to the &s;un at the ebb of the tide. 4th, To have the &s;paces under the granaries and &s;tore-hou&s;es on the docks, properly filled up or walled in. 5th, To prevent great quantities of &s;treet-dirt and ma|nure from being collected in heaps, and left for any time on the vacant lots, in and about the city. 6th, To have the &s;treets properly paved with a &s;ufficient de|&s;cent to prevent any water from &s;tanding in them; and 7th, To have the common &s;ewers, in good or|der and well covered. An attention to the&s;e cir|cum&s;tances, no doubt, will prevent the return of a like epidemic in this city; for, as I &s;ugge&s;ted &s;ome time &s;ince to the corporation, <Q>whether the di&s;ea&s;e is contagious, or whether it was imported or not; this one fact &s;eems to be pretty firmly e&s;tab|li&s;hed, that it never has <HI>&s;pread,</HI> but by the influence of putrefactive effluvia.</Q></P>
<P>If, either from a neglect of the foregoing precau|tions or from any other cau&s;es, the yellow fever &s;hould again become prevalent in any part of this

city, it certainly would be mo&s;t prudent for &s;uch as have it in their power, to remove from it; or if unavoidable circum&s;tances, or the calls of humanity &s;hould render it nece&s;&s;ary for &s;ome to continue there for a part of the time, let them if po&s;&s;ible, &s;hun the night air, as the harbinger of death, and e&s;pecially to avoid &s;leeping in that neighborhood, as they value their lives; for perhaps in the relaxed hours of re&s;t, the epidemic mia&s;mata may act with redoubled force. Dr. Lind's in&s;tances clearly &s;hews the particular dan|ger of &s;leeping within the limits of the contaminated air; many per&s;ons having been taken with the com|plaint, after having &s;lept a night on &s;hore in the low ground, while others, who had pa&s;&s;ed a con&s;iderable time there during the day, and always returned to the ve&s;&s;els at night, generally e&s;caped it.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, keeping from the night air of the epide|mic neighborhood, and the &s;leeping in a healthy part of the town: all per&s;ons who are forced to pa&s;s &s;ome of their time in the contaminated atmo&s;phere, &s;hould avoid with the mo&s;t &s;crupulous attention, exce&s;&s;es of every kind; not only of eating and drinking, but al&s;o of heat, exerci&s;e and watching. But I wi&s;h to be under&s;tood, not to mean a rigid ab&s;tinence from, or a re&s;triction with re&s;pect to the&s;e things; but only to advi&s;e moderation and regularity in the u&s;e of them, becau&s;e it is likely that a very low diet and the entire neglect of wine, with them who have been ac|cu&s;tomed to it, as well as cold, inactivity, too much &s;leep, fear, &amp;c. may as effectually predi&s;po&s;e to this complaint, as their oppo&s;ite extremes: I believe the more regularly we &s;upport the natural healthy tone of our bodies, the more powerful they will re&s;i&s;t the cau&s;es of di&s;ea&s;es applied to them.</P>

<HEAD>METHOD OF CURE.</HEAD>
<P>In the treatment of this, as of all other di&s;ea&s;es, the fir&s;t object &s;hould be to remove their cau&s;e; for although in &s;ome in&s;tanees, the human body by habit may be enabled to re&s;i&s;t the effects of injurious im|pre&s;&s;ions, and even by proper means to recover it&s;elf after morbid effects are inducted, while the cau&s;e &s;till continues; yet that phy&s;ician would be con&s;idered very deficient, who would undertake to cure an <HI>oph|thalmia</HI> cau&s;ed by re&s;iding in a &s;moky apartment, or the <HI>cholera infantum,</HI> originating from the impurity and heat of the city air, without fir&s;t advi&s;ing his pa|tients to remove from &s;uch an obnoxious &s;ituation, for although he might &s;ometimes &s;ucceed in his at|tempts, yet it certainly would be attended with more difficulty and uncertainty; &s;o al&s;o is it in the yellow fever; hence in this di&s;ea&s;e it is of the highe&s;t impor|tance to have the patient removed, as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, out of the reach of the original cau&s;e of his com|plaints, into a more &s;alubrious atmo&s;phere; a neglect of this perhaps was one main rea&s;on of the great fatality of this epidemic; therefore, &s;hould it again prevail, it would be of the utmo&s;t con&s;equence, for tho&s;e who&s;e circum&s;tances would admit of it, to &s;e|cure a proper a&s;ylum in ca&s;e of an attack, and the poor ought to be indu&s;triou&s;ly &s;ought after and ear|ne&s;tly advi&s;ed, early in their complaints, to remove to &s;uch places as the police may prepare for their re|ception. It may be remarked, that but a &s;mall pro|portion

died at Belle-vue who went there in the early &s;tages of their di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>Whether the original cau&s;e be removed or not, the next indications are,</P>
<P N="1">1. To obviate the re&s;tricted &s;tate of the bowels, and clear the alimentary canal of the &s;uper abundant bile that &s;eems to attend the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P N="2">2. To u&s;e all means in our power to obtain a re|mi&s;&s;ion of the fever; and</P>
<P N="3">3. During the remi&s;&s;ion, to re&s;tore the tone of the &s;y&s;tem &s;o as to prevent a return.</P>
<P>Whether the <HI>&s;eat and throne</HI> of this di&s;ea&s;e is in the &s;tomach and bowels, according to Dr. Warren, or not, it mu&s;t be acknowledged that it is in a great degree upon a particular attention to them, that the hopes of a cure depend, as it is upon a particular morbid affection of them that the greate&s;t danger is to be apprehended. To fulfil the fir&s;t indication, a &s;ufficient do&s;e, viz. ten or twelve grains of calomel, with as much jalap or rheubarb, &s;hould be exhibited immediately and repeated every &s;ix or eight hours, till it purges freely; its operations &s;hould be favored by the plentiful drinking of warm chicken or barley water or gruel, and keeping warm in bed; by the&s;e means oftentimes a free per&s;piration is brought on, and the &s;econd indication is accompli&s;hed at the &s;ame time; an almo&s;t complete remi&s;&s;ion being the con|&s;iquence.</P>
<P>Let no one fear the largene&s;s of the do&s;e of the purgative, or its early repetition as above recom|mended, for in no di&s;ea&s;e perhaps is it of more con|&s;equence to obtain the &s;peedy operation of medicine

than in this; it is probable many lives have been lo&s;t from the cautious timidity of Phy&s;icians, in giv|ing but &s;mall and repeated do&s;es of cathartics, till the di&s;ea&s;e &s;tole on to that &s;tage wherein the great irritability of the &s;tomach utterly refu&s;ed to retain any more of it, before they have given a &s;ufficiency effectually to evacuate the inte&s;tines.</P>
<P>If a remi&s;&s;ion does not &s;ucceed to the operation of this medicine, but &s;ymptoms of great excitement, with violent pain in the head, &amp;c. particularly in per&s;ons of a full habit of body, with a plenitude in the va&s;cular &s;y&s;tem, bleeding undoubtedly promi&s;ed and proved of the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential &s;ervice, and ought by no means to be neglected; but I do not wi&s;h to be under&s;tood to recommend the indi&s;criminate u&s;e of the lancet by any means, for there are innumera|ble circum&s;tances, both as they relate to the previous &s;tate of the patient, as well as to the exi&s;ting &s;ymp|toms, that &s;hould always govern the judicious phy|&s;ician in the u&s;e of this mo&s;t powerful remedy.</P>
<P>After the operation of the purgative, if the degree of excitement or tone in the va&s;cular &s;y&s;tem, &s;hould not ju&s;tify the loo&s;ing of blood, or if as much has been drawn as the &s;tate of the patient may render advi&s;eable, and &s;till there remain a degree of ten&s;ion in the pul&s;e, a dryne&s;s on the &s;urface, &amp;c. a &s;udorific draught of half an ounce of <HI>&s;pt. minderer</HI> with twen|ty drops of <HI>tinct. thebaic</HI> has often been exhibited with the happie&s;t effects; a &s;weat generally &s;ucceed|ing with a con&s;iderable remi&s;&s;ion of all the &s;ymptoms; in conjunction with the &s;udorific portion, the patient &s;hould have his feet and legs fomented with flannels wrung out of warm water, for as long as half an hour at lea&s;t; he &s;hould al&s;o favor its operation by a plen|tiful dilution with the beforementioned drinks.</P>

<HEAD>AN ACCOUNT OF THE FEBRILE DISORDERS WHICH PREVAILED IN SHEFFIELD, IN THE STATE OF MASSACHUSETTS, IN THE YEARS 1793, 1794 AND 1795. EXTRACTED FROM A LETTER OF WILLIAM BUEL, PHYSICIAN AT SHEFFIELD, TO E. H. SMITH, PHYSICIAN, OF NEW-YORK.</HEAD>
<P>BEFORE entering directly on the &s;ubject of the di&s;orders, which prevailed here in 1793, 1794 and 1795, I &s;hall mention &s;ome circum&s;tances relative to the face of the country in the Town of Sheffield.</P>
<P>The river Hou&s;atonak runs in a &s;erpentine cour&s;e through this town, from North to South. Upon the banks of the river, on each &s;ide, is an extent of intervale, or meadow land, averaging on both &s;ides at about a mile in breadth. The greate&s;t part of this intervale is overflowed at the time of the thawing away of the &s;now, in the &s;pring; and &s;ometimes, by large and &s;udden fre&s;hets, at other &s;ea&s;ons. The na|ture of the &s;oil, in general, is &s;uch, that, very &s;oon after the water is off, the land is dry and fit for tillage. It is, however, much inter&s;per&s;ed with coves and mar&s;hes; in the former of which the water re|mains &s;tagnant a con&s;iderable part of the &s;ummer, and in many of them perpetually; of the latter there are not many upon this river, but there are &s;ome which remain &s;uch th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ough the &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="031593_0066_0FED5103C9225930">Be&s;ide the Hou&s;atonak, there are two other con&s;i|derable &s;treams, running through part of this town, which unite and empty into that river. Upon each of the&s;e &s;treams are large tracts of low, mar&s;hy lands; great part of which is overflowed by fre&s;hets, and is never perfectly dry.&mdash;There is (which is very mate|rial) a mill-dam, on each of the&s;e &s;treams; and the two dams occa&s;ion the overflowing of &s;everal hund|red acres of the low lands. As &s;ummer advances, and the ponds fall, con&s;iderable parts of the&s;e lands are left uncovered by the water; more or le&s;s, ac|cording to the drought of the &s;ummer. In both of the&s;e ponds are large quantities of timber and other vegetable matters, which, in hot weather, are al|ways in a &s;tate of putrefaction. This &s;tate exi&s;ts in an increa&s;ed degree as the &s;ub&s;tances become more expo&s;ed to the action of the &s;un. The foetor occa|&s;ioned by this putrifying ma&s;s is &s;uch, in hot weather and when the water is low, as to be extremely offen|&s;ive to the &s;mell, at the di&s;tance of many rods.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of this town, who live in the vi|cinity of the&s;e mar&s;hy and drowned lands, have, as would naturally be expected, been always &s;ubject to remittent and intermittent fevers, from its fir&s;t &s;et|tlement. It is, however, generally remarked by the old people, that the&s;e di&s;orders have of late years&mdash; until the three la&s;t&mdash;decrea&s;ed: owing, probably, to the clearing, or partial draining, of the lands.</P>
<P>Although the di&s;orders which have prevailed in this town, for two or three years pa&s;t, are owing un|doubtedly, principally to the&s;e local cau&s;es; yet it is not improbable that &s;ome predi&s;po&s;ition to them was occa&s;ioned by a general con&s;titution of the air. To a&s;certain this point, with any degree of preci&s;ion, we ought to have before us an accurate hi&s;tory of the
<PB N="55" REF="031593_0067_0FED510587433120">
weather, for &s;everal years pa&s;t. Even then it would, perhaps, be impo&s;&s;ible; as it has ever been found a difficult matter to trace any connection between the manife&s;t qualities of the air, and the effects of a ge|neral con&s;titution of it, favorable to di&s;ea&s;e. As I am unable, either from minutes, or memory, to give any account of the weather, I &s;hall leave the mat|ter unattempted.</P>
<P>In the year 1793, during the &s;ea&s;on in which &s;uch complaints u&s;ually appear, intermittents and their concomitants were more frequent than they had been for many years before. In September and October, there were a few &s;cattering in&s;tances of bilious fevers.</P>
<P>Early in the &s;pring of 1794, inflammatory com|plaints, chiefly of the pneumonic kind, were unu&s;u|ally prevalent. They were &s;oon &s;ucceeded by inter|mittents; which were more frequent than they had been the year before. Nothing peculiar attended them; and they continued to occur pretty often through the &s;ummer.</P>
<P>Towards the la&s;t of July, the bilious, or, as it is called here, the pond-fever, began to make its ap|pearance; principally about the South Pond, one of the mill-ponds beforementioned, and near the Canaan line. There were &s;ome &s;cattered in&s;tances about the North Pond: and a few, which were at &s;uch a di&s;|tance from both, that they were, probably, occa&s;ioned by the &s;tagnant water about the great river, the Hou&s;atonak. But the di&s;order was chiefly confined to the vicinity of the South Pond. The influence of this pond appeared to extend about one mile and a half from its borders. Within this place there are about 150 inhabitants; and about 80 of this number
<PB N="56" REF="031593_0068_0FED5108A5689578">
were affected with the fever: part of them inhabit|ants of Sheffield, and a part of Canaan. Among tho&s;e who were &s;ick, there were five or &s;ix in&s;tances of mortality. There were not more than ten or twelve per&s;ons who had the di&s;order in other parts of this town. From the&s;e there was but one death; and that in a ca&s;e complicated with pregnancy, and eventually with phthi&s;is pulmonalis. People con|tinued to be attacked with this fever through the months of Augu&s;t, September and a part of October.</P>
<P>The di&s;order was, probably, in all re&s;pects, what is termed a bilious remitting fever. It began with an ague fit; inten&s;e pains in the back, head and limbs, &s;oon &s;ucceeded by thir&s;t, dryne&s;s of the &s;kin, &amp;c. continuing without much variation 18 or 20 hours: a &s;light moi&s;ture then broke out upon the &s;kin&mdash;&s;eldom a profu&s;e &s;weat; a degree of remi&s;&s;ion of the fever, and abatement of the pains, then en&s;ued, and continued till about the time of day of the fir&s;t attack, when another exacerbation of fever com|menced, with &s;ymptoms &s;imilar to the fir&s;t. If the di&s;ea&s;e was left to it&s;elf, the remi&s;&s;ions would &s;ome|times become &s;horter and more imperfect, as the pa|roxy&s;ms were repeated, until it grew to be nearly or quite a continued fever. A diarrhea, and &s;ometimes dy&s;enteric &s;ymptoms were added to the re&s;t. Mo&s;t of tho&s;e who died were attended with a preternaturally lax &s;tate of the bowels; which, in &s;everal in&s;tances, might properly be called dy&s;enteric. The tongue was, from the fir&s;t, covered with a white fur. After three or four days, a black &s;tripe began to appear; extending from the root, towards the extremity; and gradually &s;preading, as the di&s;order advanced, till the whole tongue a&s;&s;umed a black appearance. Even the teeth and gums were &s;ometimes covered by this black fur; and in &s;ome patients who afterwards re|covered.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="031593_0069_0FED510A69169DA0">In the treatment of this di&s;order, evacuation of &s;ome kind, is undoubtedly nece&s;&s;ary in the early &s;tage of it. Vene&s;ection generally produced a temporary relief from the violence of the pain, and was, proba|bly, when the con&s;titution was firm and robu&s;t, and the habit plethoric, frequently u&s;eful; but it did not appear to me to be important as a curative remedy. Emetics &s;ometimes did well; and where there was a great degree of nau&s;ea, I thought them u&s;eful. But purging, with calomel and jalap, was the mode of evacuation I preferred, and generally practi&s;ed; and the remedy which of all others appeared to me mo&s;t advantageous in the early &s;tage of the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>It is unnece&s;&s;ary for me to &s;ay any thing more, in this place, than that a&s;&s;iduous purging, in the begin|ning, and a plentiful u&s;e of the Bark, after the remi&s;|&s;ions had become &s;uch as to make it admi&s;&s;ible, were the e&s;&s;ential parts of the management of this di&s;order.</P>
<P>So &s;trong was the tendency to di&s;orders of this kind, that people continued in &s;ome in&s;tances to be affected with intermittents, or fever and ague, thro' the winter. The&s;e were very frequent in the &s;pring, but with no peculiarities, and yielding to the common remedy with the u&s;ual facility.</P>
<P>During the month of Augu&s;t 1795, I was in the county of Ontario, in the we&s;tern part of the &s;tate of New-York. There was, at that time, a di&s;order prevalent there, of the &s;ame nature with that which I found rife in Sheffield, on my return, and which I am about to de&s;cribe. It was chiefly exi&s;tent in the neighborhood of &s;tagnant waters, and in &s;ituations &s;imilar to tho&s;e places, in this town, to which the di&s;|ea&s;e was mo&s;tly confined. The treatment required was, of cour&s;e, the &s;ame.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="031593_0070_0FED5111C6A81230">On my return to Sheffield, which was the 5th of September, I found a number of the inhabitants, about the North Pond, afflicted with a fever, which began to appear about three weeks before. The people fir&s;t attacked were tho&s;e who lived neare&s;t to the pond; whole families of whom were down at once. Numbers continued to be taken, daily, chiefly within the vicinity of this Pond, or within three quar|ters of a mile of its borders, till about the middle of October; after which time there were few in&s;tances of new attacks. In this time, i. e. from the 10th of Augu&s;t to the 20th of October, of about 200 (which is not far from the number of per&s;ons living within three quarters of a mile of &s;ome of the borders of this pond) not le&s;s than 150 were affected with more or le&s;s of this di&s;ea&s;e; out of which number, but one per&s;on died, and that an aged man, previou&s;ly debili|tated and di&s;ordered.&mdash;The number affected with this fever, in all other parts of this town, did not, I believe, exceed thirty. Of the&s;e, three died: one, an aged woman: the other two, pregnant women; of whom, one died in the fever, the other &s;uffered an abortion, and died &s;ome months after, drop&s;ical.</P>
<P>The di&s;ea&s;e, this year, put on a different form to what it did the la&s;t. It might, with more propriety be called an intermittent, than a remittent fever; though it was very different from a common fever and ague. It began, like other fevers, with an ague fit, attended with pains in the head, back and limbs. The duration of this part of the paroxy&s;m was uncer|tain. It was &s;ucceeded by a hot fit, who&s;e duration was, in different per&s;ons, from &s;ix to forty-eight hours. A remi&s;&s;ion, and, &s;ometimes, nearly or quite, a perfect intermi&s;&s;ion, then came on; but who&s;e du|ration was as irregular and uncertain as was that of the paroxy&s;m before. After the fir&s;t, the paroxy&s;ms
<PB N="57" REF="031593_0071_0FED5113840A8BC0">
were not generally u&s;hered in by a regular ague fit; only &s;ome &s;light chills were felt; and the&s;e were ir|regular, both in degree and continuance. The length of the next &s;ucceeding paroxy&s;ms and intervals could, by no means, be calculated for, from the preceding: &s;o completely irregular was this di&s;order. The fever evidently tended to an intermittent form; but it could neither be called quotidian, tertian, quartan, nor by any other name u&s;ed by authors to di&s;tingui&s;h the different &s;pecies of intermitting fevers. The pains in the head, limbs and back, were very &s;evere, parti|cularly in the latter, which were &s;o univer&s;ally in|ten&s;e, that the &s;ymptom might almo&s;t be con&s;idered as charactere&s;tic of the di&s;order. In the primae viae, flatulency was nearly a con&s;tantly-attendant and very trouble&s;ome &s;ymptom. Evidences of an increa&s;ed &s;ecretion and excretion of bile, were generally pre|&s;ent through the di&s;ea&s;e, but were particularly ob|&s;ervable in the convale&s;cence. Some degree of yel|lowne&s;s of the &s;kin, which was almo&s;t univer&s;al, indi|cated a reab&s;orption of this fluid, and a depo&s;ition of it upon the &s;kin. This yellowne&s;s was in two in|&s;tances, which I &s;aw, very inten&s;e. A &s;light degree of delirium was very common, during the height of the fever. The appearance of the tongue was much the &s;ame that it was la&s;t year.</P>
<P>My method of treating the fever of this year, was &s;imilar to that which I employed the la&s;t year.&mdash; Purging, in the beginning, and afterwards a plentiful u&s;e of the Bark, appeared to me to be the mo&s;t &s;uc|ce&s;sful way of managing it. In extreme ca&s;es, parti|cularly, a free and full exhibition of bark, wine and laudanum, &s;eemed the only means of &s;alvation. It was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary that the patient &s;hould be thoroughly purged, previous to the u&s;e of &s;timulants, otherwi&s;e the bark, wine or laudanum, would have
<PB N="58" REF="031593_0072_0FED511534F8F190">
very pernicious effects. I &s;aw &s;everal in&s;tances, at the we&s;tward, where, by too early a u&s;e of the&s;e me|dicines, the fever was changed into a continued form, attended with a con&s;tantly dry and yellow &s;kin, com|ato&s;e &s;ymptoms, &amp;c. One of the in&s;tances of extreme yellowne&s;s, which I have mentioned, was of this kind, and at the we&s;tward. I removed this &s;ymptom, and recovered the patient, by giving repeated do&s;es of calomel and jalap, &s;ome per&s;pirative medicines, and afterwards the bark, wine, &amp;c. Each purge, in this ca&s;e, le&s;&s;ened the degree of yellowne&s;s, very appa|rently. The other in&s;tance of inten&s;e yellowne&s;s, which I &s;aw, was in this town, in the ca&s;e of the pregnant woman, whom I have mentioned to have died in the fever. This woman's fever never had di&s;tinct intermi&s;&s;ions. Several &s;light attempts were made to admini&s;ter the bark; but it would not do. Perhaps my timidity in the u&s;e of evacuants, on ac|count of her &s;ituation, was injurious to her.</P>
<P>The Bark did not &s;u&s;pend the paroxy&s;ms, in this di&s;order, in as &s;hort a time as it does in common in|termittents; but, if the patient was properly pre|pared, and the u&s;e of it was per&s;evered in, it never failed to have the effect.</P>
<P>Purging was probably u&s;eful in a twofold way: Fir&s;t, by carrying off the &s;uperfluous bile; which was, evidently, &s;ecreted and excreted in a preternatu|ral quantity: Secondly, by reducing the &s;thenic dia|the&s;is, which was, perhaps, always pre&s;ent, in the early &s;tage of the di&s;order.</P>
<P>It is true, that tho&s;e who&s;e fever was &s;u&s;pended by the bark, were &s;ubject to frequent relap&s;es, and to a long and lingering &s;tate of convale&s;cence. This drew an odium upon that medicine; and many were
<PB N="59" REF="031593_0073_0FED5116F0EB6060">
induced to believe that it was owing to the u&s;e of it that people were &s;o long in recovering, and, of cour&s;e, that it was improper. I am convinced, how|ever, from very attentive ob&s;ervation, that tho&s;e who did not take the bark, but &s;uffered the fever gradually to wear away, as it &s;ometimes would, were equally &s;ubject to tho&s;e inconveniences. Indeed, this &s;eems to be the nature of the di&s;ea&s;e. The old people in this town, who recollect the times when di&s;orders of this kind have prevailed here before, and when the bark was not at all u&s;ed, inform me that tho&s;e who were afflicted with them, were a long time in recover|ing.</P>
<P>It &s;eems that, in all ca&s;es, when patients have got rid of the fever, either by means of the bark, or otherwi&s;e, there remains an increa&s;ed di&s;po&s;ition to the formation and excretion of bile, and that this humor accumulates in the primae viae, till it fir&s;t de|&s;troys the appetite and occa&s;ions nau&s;ea, and then excites a &s;pontaneous di&s;charge by &s;tool or vomiting, or a relap&s;e of fever, or both. A continuance in the u&s;e of &s;ome laxative medicine, after a recovery, has a tendency to prevent the&s;e effects; and, if &s;trictly at|tended to, would probably prevent them, and per|haps obviate the di&s;po&s;ition to relap&s;e entirely.</P>
<P>In reflecting on phenomena of this kind, the hu|man mind is anxious to fix on &s;omething &s;atisfactory as their cau&s;es. Specific contagion, I am convinced, was in no in&s;tance, which came under my ob&s;erva|tion, either here or at the we&s;tward, the cau&s;e of the propagation of the di&s;order. That mar&s;h effluvia, to who&s;e action the inhabitants of &s;ome parts of this town are &s;ubject, is the exciting cau&s;e, and is nece&s;|&s;ary to the production of the di&s;orders in que&s;tion, is beyond any manner of doubt. This is evident from
<PB N="60" REF="031593_0074_0FED511AFAA4AA30">
their exi&s;ting only where this influence extends. But &s;omething more is wanting; otherwi&s;e we cannot account for their prevailing in &s;ome years, and not in others. Every circum&s;tance relative to the ponds<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I have endeavored to di&s;cover the cau&s;e why the &s;ickne&s;s in 1794, was confined almo&s;t entirely to the South, and in 1795, to the North-Pond; but I can find no local circum&s;tances to have exi&s;ted which &s;hould produce &s;ickne&s;s about one, and not about the other, in either of the&s;e years.</NOTE> and mar&s;hes in this town has, apparently, been the &s;ame, for many years pa&s;t; and yet very little of this form of di&s;ea&s;e has appeared, for ten or twelve years back, until the two la&s;t. We mu&s;t either &s;uppo&s;e a peculiar con&s;titution of the atmo&s;phere, occa&s;ioning a predi&s;po&s;ition to the&s;e di&s;orders, and coinciding with the local cau&s;e, or mar&s;h effluvia; or that the mar&s;h effluvia it&s;elf is, by &s;ome peculiarity of the atmo&s;|phere, wrought up to a higher pitch of virulence, and thus produces a higher degree of di&s;ea&s;e. I am in|clined to admit the latter &s;uppo&s;ition, as I am con|vinced that the fevers which have prevailed here, for two or three years pa&s;t, and the common intermittent fever, are the &s;ame, only differing in degree. I have &s;een all degrees, from the milde&s;t form of intermit|tents, to the mo&s;t extreme of bilious remitting fever. It is impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ay where the line of divi&s;ion &s;hall be drawn. The di&s;ea&s;e this year &s;eems to have formed a connecting link between intermittent and bilious fever; and, were I to name it, I would call it a bil|ious intermittent. Should the intermittent fever, in its u&s;ual form, prevail next year, the di&s;order may be &s;aid, in the three years, to have been in regular gra|dations run through.</P>

<P>THE following letters were written at the reque&s;t, and for the information, of a medical friend, with whom the writer has long been accu&s;tomed to cor|re&s;pond, both on profe&s;&s;ional and general topics. Being compo&s;ed originally without any view to the pre&s;s, and nearly fini&s;hed before the idea of publica|tion was &s;ugge&s;ted, they will need much indulgence for many defects of expre&s;&s;ion and method, which the writer has not lei&s;ure to correct. Much, too, mu&s;t be pardoned to that pruriency of &s;tyle, and po|&s;itivene&s;s of deci&s;ion, into which per&s;ons in habits of fraternal intimacy are apt to fall, and which the laws of epi&s;tolary intercour&s;e do not forbid. A careful revi&s;ion, would, doubtle&s;s, have rendered the&s;e let|ters more acceptable, in the&s;e re&s;pects, and have cha&s;ti&s;ed them of tho&s;e repetitions of &s;entiment and expre&s;&s;ion, which, though partially avoided in tran&s;|cribing for the pre&s;s, &s;till occur too frequently. But this was impo&s;&s;ible. A further, and more &s;atisfacto|ry, apology may be expected, for the opinions which they contain;&mdash;con&s;idering the youth, and &s;uppo&s;ed inexperience, of the writer. It is not improbable that ha&s;ty and unfounded opinions have crept into the following pages; opinions un&s;upported by fact, and which informed rea&s;on would di&s;claim. If &s;uch there are, no per&s;on can be more de&s;irous, than he who has delivered, to di&s;cover them, or more ready to relinqui&s;h them. But a conclu&s;ion again&s;t an opinion &s;hould re&s;t on &s;ome better foundation than the age of him who maintains it.

<HEAD>LETTERS ON THE FEVER OF 1795.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="letter">
<HEAD><HI>LETTER FIRST.</HI> INTRODUCTORY.</HEAD>
<P>IN compliance with your wi&s;hes, and in return for the communication with which you lately favored me, relative to the di&s;ea&s;es which prevailed in the neighborhood where you re&s;ide, for the la&s;t three years, I have put together all the &s;canty information I po&s;&s;e&s;s, re&s;pecting the fever which was the occa&s;ion of &s;o much di&s;tre&s;s to this City, in the la&s;t &s;ummer and autumn.&mdash;I regret my inability to communicate a more minute and &s;pecific &s;tatement of facts; and the more, as there &s;eems little probability, at pre&s;ent, that any per&s;on, qualified for the ta&s;k, will undertake it. Various circum&s;tances con&s;pired to narrow the &s;phere of my ob&s;ervation; and this may have led me into erroneous conclu&s;ions, which more exten&s;ive practice and wider ob&s;ervation would have corrected in me, and may have corrected in others. But, how faulty &s;oever my rea&s;onings may be thought, I mu&s;t demand ab&s;olute and entire credit for my facts. In the&s;e, I cannot well have been deceived: for the very circum&s;tances which rendered them few, made me more attentive, and gave me lei&s;ure to be accu|rate. There is but one po&s;&s;ible way in which any fal&s;ity can be chargeable on them; and this might be, were I to pretend to decide that the cour&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e was always &s;uch, as when it came beneath my notice. But you will under&s;tand me &s;trictly. I
<PB N="66" REF="031593_0079_0FED512B91EB3050">
de&s;cribe what I &s;aw; and mean only <HI>then</HI> to make a remark general, <HI>when</HI> I &s;ow expre&s;s it, and when I find a concurrent opinion on the part of many. In my rea&s;onings on facts, you will not blame me for taking a range &s;omewhat wider; for, &s;hould I, in my way, light on &s;ome truth, intere&s;ting and important, it will well repay you for the fatigue of accompanying me; and, &s;hould I not, your friend&s;hip will excu&s;e me, in this in&s;tance, as it has often done before. Of one thing further you ought to be forwarned: That, con|cerning every thing connected with the fever of 1795, where opinion may be exerci&s;ed, there is va|riety of opinion. And as, in this conte&s;t of jarring and ho&s;tile opinions, but one can have ju&s;tice on its &s;ide, I would have you follow mine, with diffidence, into the field of controver&s;y. Victory does not always incline the balance on the &s;ide of right; but even &s;hould mine de&s;erve defeat, it will &s;uffer in the com|pany of myriads.</P>

<HEAD><HI>LETTER SECOND.</HI> An account of the &s;ituation and peculiarities of that part of the City in which the Fever mo&s;t prevailed, in <HI>1795.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THOUGH the fever continued to extend it&s;elf, to the la&s;t, yet it never became general over the city; and, for a long time, it was mo&s;tly confined to a par|ticular di&s;trict. As the &s;ea&s;on advanced, the pecu|liarities of this di&s;trict may be &s;uppo&s;ed to have be|come common to a larger portion of the city; and their exten&s;ion to the whole only prevented by the &s;etting in of winter. To the di&s;trict alluded to, the Ea&s;t river, from Long-I&s;land ferry to Mr. Rutgers's,
<PB N="67" REF="031593_0080_0FED512D4BC00E80">
forms the ea&s;tern boundary; the northern reaches from thence to Divi&s;ion-&s;treet; thence we&s;terly, down Divi&s;ion-&s;treet, Chatham-&s;treet, the extremity of Pearl-&s;treet, into William-&s;treet, to Franckfort-&s;treet, down this la&s;t to Gold-&s;treet, through that to Beek|man-&s;treet, along which the line proceeds to Pearl-&s;treet, as far as the Market, down which it &s;hould be continued to the river.&mdash;The &s;pace included in the&s;e bounds, is <HI>all</HI> over which the fever, according to the be&s;t of my remembrance, exerted any power, till after it had reached its height; when it extended down Water-&s;treet, a little below Wall-&s;treet, and proved very mortal. It is true that there were a few per&s;ons affected in various other parts of the town; but, during the great part of the prevalence of the fever, it was principally active in the north-ea&s;tern and middle parts of the di&s;trict comprehended as above: and, as a thorough knowledge of the peculiarities of this portion of our city is, in my opinion, indi&s;pen&s;a|ble to the hi&s;tory of the di&s;ea&s;e which afflicted it, I cannot doubt your patience with the minute de&s;crip|tion I think it nece&s;&s;ary to give.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t and mo&s;t obvious remark, on the greater part of the di&s;trict, ju&s;t pointed out, is, that it is the lowe&s;t, flatte&s;t, and mo&s;t &s;unken part of the whole city. Some places are much more &s;unken than others; but the whole &s;pace is evidently &s;o, compared with the adjacent ground; and appears to have an in|clination, more or le&s;s ob&s;ervable, in different &s;treets, to the Ea&s;t river. This inclination is very con&s;ider|able in Dover-&s;treet; a &s;treet which is &s;aid always to have &s;uffered from fevers of this kind, during the hot &s;ea&s;on. From the divi&s;ion of Pearl and Cherry-&s;treets, down the latter, the de&s;cent is rapid, to &s;ome where near James's-&s;treet; about which is the lowe&s;t part of the &s;treet, and from whence it is nearly level
<PB N="68" REF="031593_0081_0FED512F04857498">
to the northern boundary. Beyond this bound, the ground ri&s;es again; and the made ground, by the river &s;ide, is al&s;o &s;omewhat elevated: &s;o likewi&s;e, is the whole of the ground over which the we&s;terly line pa&s;&s;es&mdash;through Divi&s;ion, Chatham, &amp;c. &s;treets. Thus you will perceive, that the part of the city where the fever was mo&s;t active, for the longe&s;t period, forms, as it were, a ba&s;in, having its &s;ide, neare&s;t the water, a little inclined. Within this ba&s;in, there are &s;everal &s;maller cavities; one of which, in particular will re|quire a further de&s;cription. Tho&s;e &s;treets, al&s;o, which are not included in this hollow, but which lie along the river, will require &s;ome attention; which &s;hall be given them.</P>
<P>The extreme irregularity in the di&s;po&s;ition of the &s;treets, and the narrowne&s;s of the greater number of them, are great ob&s;tacles to a free ventilation of this city. This misfortune, common to every part of it, falls with peculiar heavine&s;s on that di&s;trict which has ju&s;t been &s;poken of. The comparatively high and neighboring lands of Morti&s;&s;ania and Long-I&s;land, receive almo&s;t &s;olely the benefit of breezes from the north-ea&s;t and ea&s;t: The Sound, which divides them from the city, being too narrow to add much force and fre&s;hne&s;s to a breeze nearly &s;pent on their heights. North, the i&s;land ri&s;es into little hills, from which the wind pa&s;&s;es on to the high parts of the city; rarely vi&s;iting the low and intervening &s;pace; unle&s;s it may be the topmo&s;t rooms of the hou&s;es: and, as the hou&s;es are generally low, the effects of a wind from this quarter mu&s;t be incon&s;iderable.&mdash; North-we&s;terly, there is &s;omewhat more of an open|ing; but even this is &s;mall. We&s;t, &s;outh we&s;t, and &s;outh, the other parts of the town, which are higher, and thickly &s;ettled, break the force of the gales from the&s;e points. So that, thus &s;ituated, this quarter of
<PB N="69" REF="031593_0082_0FED5131D63E2720">
the city, though it were perfectly well laid out, would have but little chance for a free ventilation: irregu|larly di&s;po&s;ed and narrow as the &s;treets are, we mu&s;t be convinced of the impo&s;&s;ibility of its receiving the nece&s;&s;ary &s;upply of fre&s;h air. You will under&s;tand me as &s;peaking of a thorough ventilation, and in the &s;ultry &s;ea&s;on, when it is mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary: a partial &s;upply of air, equal to the &s;upport of a feveri&s;h exi&s;|tence, it undoubtedly obtains.</P>
<P>Much of the ground, in the northern part of this di&s;trict, is &s;wampy, and abounds with little pools and puddles of &s;tagnant water. This was e&s;pecially true la&s;t &s;ummer and autumn; there being great rains, and no adequate means for conducting off the water. Indeed, &s;o flat are &s;ome of the <HI>paved</HI> &s;treets, in this quarter, that the rains did not run down the gutters, but continued in little puddles, and were evaporated from the places whereon they fell. In the new &s;treets, which are unpaved, and without any gutters, numer|ous imperfect ditches a&s;&s;i&s;ted the di&s;po&s;ition of the water to &s;tagnate. The&s;e places were often mud|dy, when the &s;outhern part of the town was dry; and the &s;teams from them very offen&s;ive, when the dry &s;treets, towards the North river, were perfectly &s;weet.</P>
<P>Several of the paved &s;treets, and indeed the greater number, in the di&s;trict of which I am &s;peaking, are narrow and crooked; &s;ome with neither &s;ide walks nor gutters, and by far the large&s;t portion of them, mi&s;erably built. Mo&s;t of tho&s;e which are unpaved, are, in all re&s;pects, &s;till wor&s;e; the buildings chiefly wooden, and placed on the ground; the old ones falling to decay; the new, but imperfectly fini&s;hed. Of them all, it may be remarked, that they are much expo&s;ed, &s;ome of them more than others, to the full
<PB N="70" REF="031593_0083_0FED51378B3C09A0">
influence of the docks, whatever that may be, and it cannot be &s;alutary; or to that of a boiling &s;un, from early in the morning, till the middle of the afternoon; and &s;ome of them, to both.</P>
<P>So much for the &s;treets, generally: a few particu|lars, concerning &s;ome of them, are nece&s;&s;ary to the formation of a perfect idea of this di&s;trict.</P>
<P>A line, drawn from the corner of Ferry and Pearl-&s;treets, up the latter, to where William &s;treet enters it; then down William to Franckfort, and through that, a part of Gold and Ferry-&s;treets, to Pearl-&s;treet again, will form the ridge of a new cavity (included in the principal boundaries above mentioned) which &s;eems contrived, by art, for the dwelling place of fever. This court-yard of the palace of death, is di|vided by &s;everal di&s;mal lanes, courteou&s;ly denomi|nated &s;treets; &s;uch as Vandewater, Ro&s;e and Jacob-&s;treets, &amp;c. which form the borders to innumerable tan-vats. The whole is one va&s;t tan-yard, the firm parts of which &s;eem to have been con&s;tructed by art in the mid&s;t of an exten&s;ive quagmire. To this place, as far as I can di&s;cover, there is no outlet. Think what mu&s;t be the condition of it, in the months of Augu&s;t and September!&mdash;Yet human beings live here; and habit renders its noxious exhalations, in &s;ome &s;ort, harmle&s;s to them. It is remarkable that few per&s;ons, regularly inhabiting this hollow, died of the fever la&s;t year. To tho&s;e, who&s;e evil de&s;tiny led them to &s;eek a new dwelling place there, it proved highly pe&s;tilential.</P>
<P>Dover-&s;treet is a &s;hort, narrow &s;treet, running from the beginning of Cherry-&s;treet, down to the Ea&s;t river; and contains near twenty buildings.&mdash; The de&s;cent, from Cherry into Water-&s;treet, is very
<PB N="71" REF="031593_0084_0FED513A576AC040">
rapid. As the expo&s;ure is nearly to the ea&s;t, it re|ceives the whole effect of the &s;un, from 6 A. M. to 3 P. M. in the &s;ummer. The de&s;cent makes it ea&s;y to keep the &s;urface of the &s;treet clean; though it pre|vents a free ventilation. But it has been rai&s;ed, &s;e|veral feet, &s;ince the buildings, which are mo&s;tly low, were erected; &s;o that the road is, in many in|&s;tances, up to the middle of the lower &s;tory windows; leaving the cellars to the hou&s;es, and cellar kitchens, without a communication with the &s;treet. The yards remaining as before, are, of con&s;equence, much lower than the &s;treet; without vent; and, of nece&s;|&s;ity, all the water, and filth of every kind, which gathers in them, mu&s;t there &s;tagnate, ferment and putrify. Add to this, &s;ome of the&s;e yards are capa|cious, and contain little, decayed, wooden huts; &s;ometimes built directly on the ground; and contain|ing, oftentimes, &s;everal families.</P>
<P>Water-&s;treet, above Dover-&s;treet, is chiefly com|po&s;ed of low, decayed and dirty wooden buildings. This &s;treet being either made-ground entirely, or rai&s;ed like Dover-&s;treet, the &s;ame is true of the &s;itu|ation of the hou&s;es and yards. And, le&s;t any of the filth, or water, &s;hould drain off, from any of the yards, the we&s;tern &s;ide of Water-&s;treet has been kindly converted, by the enlightened zeal of the directors of the&s;e affairs, into a perfect dyke; which an&s;wers its de&s;ign, mo&s;t completely, by preventing even the &s;lighte&s;t leakage. Be&s;ide, as this &s;treet lies directly on the water, it has the benefit of the whole force of the &s;un, the greater part of the day; and of the exhalations from the docks; which are here in great number, and in the highe&s;t &s;tate of their per|fection. There is, however, a better opportunity for fre&s;h air, in this, than in &s;ome other &s;treets. Yet even this is an advantage which the rage for im|provement
<PB N="72" REF="031593_0085_0FED513C11B0DEA0">
threatens to transfer to a new &s;treet, &s;till further out in the river; which, if completed, may form another dyke, to the increa&s;ed plea&s;antne&s;s and health of this quarter of the town.</P>
<P>Of Roo&s;evelt, Catharine, James, Oliver, &amp;c. &s;treets, nearly the &s;ame remarks are true as of Dover and the upper part of Water-&s;treet: for though they are &s;omewhat wider, &s;traighter, and have more good and new buildings in them, yet they are rai&s;ed in the &s;ame manner, have &s;unken yards, and under-ground apartments; and Roo&s;evelt &s;treet has an open &s;ink, where the drippings of the tea-water pump, after having gently collected all the filth in their way, are received; and being ju&s;t enough to keep up a con|&s;tant dropping, and not enough to wa&s;h the gutter, or the &s;ewer, the &s;tench is mo&s;t intolerable, during the &s;ultry months.</P>
<P>To many other of the&s;e &s;treets the &s;ame remarks will apply; and to &s;ome with aggravated force: but what has been &s;aid, will, perhaps, be &s;ufficient to aid your imagination in the conception of a ju&s;t idea of their condition: I mean of their nece&s;&s;ary and una|voidable condition.</P>
<P>Of the Docks, it may be enough to mention, ge|nerally, that they are badly contrived in every part of the town; and wor&s;t of all, in this part; being broken up into numerous little wharves, thus form|ing narrow &s;lips, where the ground is left bare at ebb tide; and where vegetable, animal, and excremen|titious matters, being thrown in, at all times, in&s;tead of being ca&s;t into the &s;tream, ferment, putrify, and render the &s;tench truly pe&s;tiferous. Indeed, this is &s;o much the ca&s;e, with all of them, in the &s;ummer, that, except to per&s;ons habituated to their exhala|tions,
<PB N="73" REF="031593_0086_0FED513EF4A2B370">
they are ab&s;olutely intolerable; exciting, in per&s;ons of a delicate make, immediate vomiting; and in others nau&s;ea, indige&s;tion, head-ach, or &s;ome tem|porary illne&s;s, when expo&s;ed to them but a &s;hort time.</P>
<P>In addition to the above-related facts, concerning the condition of the &s;treets, in that part of the city where care was mo&s;t needed, it may be remarked that, at no time, was there ever &s;o great an apparent inat|tention to pre&s;erving them clean. Be&s;ides the impe|diments which the level nature of the &s;treets, in many parts of the town, pre&s;ented to the draining off of the filth which is con&s;tantly accumulating in large towns like this, artificial impediments were permitted; as if death were not &s;ufficiently active, and needed the aid of the magi&s;trate. In all the &s;treets where buildings were going forward, the workmen were allowed to re&s;train the cour&s;e of the water, in the gutters, by forming little dams, for their convenience in making their morter. The effect of this &s;toppage of water was &s;o great, that even in Broadway, one of the &s;treets the be&s;t calculated of any in the city for free ventilation, in that part of it where the new Tontine Tavern was building, the &s;tench was exceed|ingly offen&s;ive. And in this condition was it allowed to remain for near two months; though it was al|mo&s;t under the windows of the principal magi&s;trate of the city. If this were true of the wide&s;t, and one of the be&s;t aired and cleane&s;t &s;treets, of New-York, what think you was the &s;tate of tho&s;e narrow, crook|ed, flat, unpaved, muddy alleys, mentioned above? No one can form even a faint idea who has not walked through them, in the middle of &s;ome one of tho&s;e deadly, &s;uffocative days, which we experienced in September la&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="031593_0087_0FED5143B23F8298">But this is not all: be&s;ide tho&s;e ma&s;&s;es of &s;emi|putrid vegetable and animal matters&mdash;cabbage, tur|nips, the heads and entrails of fi&s;h, &amp;c. which, at all times of the year, out of compa&s;&s;ion to men who might be u&s;efully employed as &s;cavengers to the city, are allowed to complete the putrefactive proce&s;s, un|di&s;turbed, in the middle of the &s;treets,&mdash;the &s;ight and the &s;mell were &s;hocked, at every turn, by dead rats, fowls, cats, dogs and pigs. So remarkably was this the ca&s;e, that I que&s;tion whether there could have been found a &s;ingle &s;treet, alley, or even bye-lane, of any tolerable length, which did not lend its aid to render this exhibition full and frequent.</P>
<P>The preceding &s;tatement, melancholy as it may appear, will convey a very inadequate idea of our misfortune, in re&s;pect to &s;ituation, without &s;pecial information concerning the &s;ea&s;on, as it appeared here, during the reign of the &s;ever; and a knowledge of the people who mo&s;tly inhabited the&s;e parts of the city, and on whom the &s;everity of the di&s;order was inflicted. With this knowledge I &s;hall en|deavor to furni&s;h you; but the length which this letter has already acquired will excu&s;e me, to you, for po&s;tponing the attempt, to a future opportunity.</P>

<HEAD><HI>LETTER THIRD.</HI> Some Account of the Sea&s;on of <HI>1795.</HI></HEAD>
<P>PHYSICIANS, from the earlie&s;t ages of medical re|cord, have remarked that great peculiarities and irre|gularities of &s;ea&s;on, have exerci&s;ed an unfriendly influ|ence on human health: And Hippocrates, him&s;elf, takes
<PB N="75" REF="031593_0088_0FED3181A36105A8">
notice of the difficulty, which hence ari&s;es, of forming a proper judgment, and adopting a &s;uitable method of cure, in tho&s;e di&s;ea&s;es which occur under &s;uch cir|cum&s;tances. The importance of this divi&s;ion of my &s;ubject, makes me regret that it is in my power to fur|ni&s;h you with no other than general information. You will be the more ready to overlook this defect, when you recollect that I do not pretend to deliver a hi&s;tory of the fever, and are informed that there is &s;ome probability that this particular defect will be &s;upplied by another hand.</P>
<P>Generally, then&mdash;every one knows that the &s;um|mer and autumn of 1795 were exce&s;&s;ively &s;ultry and exce&s;&s;ively wet. Every article of hou&s;ehold furni|ture, or in u&s;e about a hou&s;e, &s;u&s;ceptible of mould, was &s;peedily and deeply covered with it. It &s;eemed to penetrate places where we &s;hould have deemed its appearance impo&s;&s;ible. A friend of mine found a pocket-book of Morocco leather quite mouldy; though it was in the drawer of a private de&s;k, inclo&s;ed within a large de&s;k&mdash;both of which were u&s;ually locked&mdash;and covered by papers. Boots and &s;hoes hung up by a wall, near a fire-place, heated every day, contracted mould within twenty-four hours.</P>
<P>Meats &s;poiled in the market-place uncommonly quick; and tho&s;e which were brought home, appa|rently fre&s;h and good, in the morning, were often found unfit to be eaten, when cooked and brought upon table.</P>
<P>E&s;culent vegetables, in general, and e&s;pecially fruits, were unu&s;ually poor, tough and ta&s;tele&s;s. The peach, particularly that called the cling-&s;tone, was &s;carcely dige&s;tible; and often occa&s;ioned temporary
<PB N="76" REF="031593_0089_0FED5149C794D390">
illne&s;&s;es, quite &s;evere, while it doubtle&s;s aided in the production, or aggravation, of the fever.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Vegetable growth was uncommonly rapid and abundant, in the &s;ummer of 1795. I mention this that no mi&s;take may ari&s;e from the above remark concerning e&s;culent vegetables. The wore rank they grow, beyond a certain degree, the more ta&s;tele&s;s they are; and the influence of a wet &s;ea&s;on, in rendering roots and fruits tough, as well as in&s;ipid, is well known.</P><P>It is worthy of remark, that many fruit-trees, plumb-trees in particular, blo&s;&s;omed a &s;econd time, la&s;t year, and produced an imperfect and &s;econd crop of fruit.</P></NOTE></P>
<P>Flies were very numerous and trouble&s;ome, in every part of the city, in the beginning of &s;ummer; but they &s;uddenly di&s;appeared, about the middle of July, from the more airy parts of the town, collecting in &s;warms, in the le&s;s healthy parts, and &s;ucceeded, every where, by clouds of mu&s;ketoes, incredibly large and di&s;tre&s;&s;ing: and the&s;e continued to afflict us, long after the time when they commonly depart. Almo&s;t every per&s;on &s;uffered exceedingly from the bites of the&s;e in&s;ects; and foreigners e&s;pecially. In &s;ome they occa&s;ioned univer&s;al &s;wellings, and erup|tions, &s;omewhat like Pemphigus; and in others nu|merous little ulcers. The&s;e la&s;t, a phy&s;ician of my acquaintance, &s;aw even in a native American. The irritation, re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s, and con&s;equent watchfulne&s;s and fatigue, occa&s;ioned by the&s;e animals, no doubt predi&s;po&s;ed the well to be affected by the fever; while they extremely harra&s;&s;ed the &s;ick, and retarded their recovery.</P>
<P>During the whole of this &s;ea&s;on, I remember but one thunder-&s;torm; and this was very gentle. There was but a &s;ingle <HI>hard</HI> clap of thunder, for more than four months, that I remember; and very little thun|der and lightning, at any time.</P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="031593_0090_0FED514CD0ACD068">Our rains, exce&s;&s;ive in quantity and frequency as they were, &s;eemed to have lo&s;t their wonted power of cooling the air. In tho&s;e &s;treets, mo&s;t unhealthy, and lea&s;t ventilated, this effect was, in a degree, ob|&s;ervable; but, in the airy and healthy parts of the town, on the contrary, they never failed to render the heat more intolerable; and the &s;teams from the hot pavement were like tho&s;e of a vapor bath. The clouds, too, &s;eemed to &s;hut out every kind of breeze. &mdash;One of the&s;e heavy rains, which continued two or three days, &s;eemed to po&s;&s;e&s;s all the qualities of &s;team. It pervaded every rece&s;s of the hou&s;es, and di&s;&s;olved the be&s;t glue&mdash;&s;o that furniture, in many in&s;tances, which had been long &s;tanding, fell in pieces.</P>
<P>Fogs, which Dr. Lind enumerates among the &s;igns of an unhealthy climate, and cau&s;es of di&s;ea&s;es&mdash;page 134 of his E&s;&s;ay on hot climates, &amp;c.&mdash;prevailed in the city, and &s;pread over all the mo&s;t unhealthy parts, in particular, in a remarkable manner,&mdash;in the even|ings&mdash;for a con&s;iderable part of September and Oc|tober.

<HEAD><HI>LETTER FOURTH.</HI> Some circum&s;tances relative to the principal &s;ufferers by the Fever of <HI>1795.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IT is a fact, generally admitted, I believe, that, of tho&s;e who were &s;ick and who died of the Fever of 1795, the greater number were foreigners: per&s;ons, either ju&s;t arrived from other States, from the We&s;t-Indies, and from Europe; or who had not been many months, or years, &s;ettled in this city. It is probable that the proportion of citizens, who died, to &s;trangers, did not exceed one to &s;even. Of the&s;e &s;trangers, it is thought, a large number were Iri&s;h; and there are &s;ome rea&s;ons why this should be true; but I cannot pretend to know it to be &s;o, from my own ob&s;erva|tion. The cau&s;es productive of di&s;ea&s;e in foreign|ers, in tho&s;e of this nation in particular, are numer|ous, and &s;ome of them de&s;erve particular attention. This I de&s;ign to be&s;tow upon them, after remarking, that, both among natives and foreigners, the &s;everity of the di&s;ea&s;e was experienced by the poor.</P>
<P N="1">I. Dr. Blane, in his ob&s;ervations on the di&s;ea&s;es of &s;eamen, remarks, <Q>that it &s;ometimes happens, that a &s;hip, with a long e&s;tabli&s;hed crew, &s;hall be very <HI>healthy;</HI> yet, if &s;trangers are introduced among them, who are al&s;o <HI>healthy,</HI> &s;ickne&s;s will be mu|tually produced;</Q> and Dr. Ru&s;h, in the fir&s;t vo|lume of his "Medical Ob&s;ervations and Inquiries" takes notice of this remark of Dr. Blane's, and con|firms it, by a reference to the experience of our coun|try, during the late war. The&s;e are his words&mdash; <Q>The hi&s;tory of di&s;ea&s;es furni&s;hes many proofs of the truth of this a&s;&s;ertion.&mdash;It was very remarkable, that, while the American army at Cambridge, in
<PB N="80" REF="031593_0093_0FED52616F9CB0B0">
the year 1775, con&s;i&s;ted only of New-England men (who&s;e habits and manners were the &s;ame) there was &s;carcely any &s;ickne&s;s among them. It was not till the troops of the ea&s;tern, middle and &s;outhern &s;tates, met at New-York and Ticonderoga, in the year 1776, that the Typhus became univer|&s;al, and &s;pread with &s;uch peculiar mortality in the armies of the United States.</Q></P>
<P>It is unnece&s;&s;ary to enlarge, in this place, on the oppre&s;&s;ions and di&s;tre&s;&s;es of what are called the lower order of the people in Europe. War, which doubles the burthens upon every rank in &s;ociety, exerci&s;es an aggravated violence upon the poor. This violence, &s;everely felt by all, in England, chiefly falls upon the manufacturing poor; who are, at the &s;ame time, the mo&s;t ignorant, abject and depraved: in Ireland, its effects are more general, including in its circle of wretchedne&s;s, the cultivator, as well as the mechanic. The pre&s;ent war in Europe, unparalelled as it is for the number of men involved in it, has given birth to oppre&s;&s;ions and calamities equally new and de&s;truct|ive. Under the&s;e circum&s;tances, and when men of fortune and re&s;pectability, di&s;gu&s;ted and di&s;heartened at the enormous ma&s;s of mi&s;ery which every day and every hour pre&s;ented to their view, turned their thoughts towards another hemi&s;phere, it is not to be wondered at, that the wretched and depre&s;&s;ed poor &s;hould pant for a &s;ettlement in a country, where li|berty is the portion of every man, and independence the &s;ure crown of all his hone&s;t labors; and which had been, <HI>fallaciou&s;ly,</HI> repre&s;ented as courting their ac|ceptance, and loading their untoiling hands with every gift of fortune.&mdash;The real ble&s;&s;ings of our go|vernment and country are precious and ine&s;timable; but they are of a nature not to be felt and enjoyed by minds depraved by ignorance and deba&s;ed by &s;lavery.

That temperate enjoyment of the goods of life, and moderate exerci&s;e of the ble&s;&s;ings of independence, which, alone, enlightened liberty &s;anctions, can neither be conceived of, nor reli&s;hed, by tho&s;e who have been accu&s;tomed to crouch beneath the iron rod of de&s;poti&s;m. Liberty, according to their ideas, was the rever&s;e of all they felt; and independence, the unlimited gratifica|tion of all their appetites. The mi&s;repre&s;entations, too, of &s;peculating and unprincipled men, who were inte|re&s;ted in the &s;ale of large tracts of un&s;ettled territory, had fo&s;tered and extended the&s;e erroneous concep|tions. Hence, when the poor and mi&s;erable emi|grants, on their arrival here, found that neither gold, nor farms, &s;olicited their acceptance; that, in Ame|rica, as well as in Europe, their life was alike de&s;tined to be a life of toil; when they perceived that licen|tiou&s;ne&s;s, the only liberty of which they had any no|tion, brought puni&s;hment along with it; the di&s;appoint|ment, new and unexpected, became a powerful ag|gravation to every other cau&s;e of di&s;ea&s;e. You will not under&s;tand me as extending the&s;e la&s;t remarks to all emigrants to this country, nor &s;uppo&s;e that de|ceived hope was pre&s;ent, or active, in every ca&s;e. On &s;ome, even of the better &s;ort, it undoubtedly had a very pernicious influence; on the poor and friendle&s;s, effects &s;till more melancholy.&mdash;But to return:&mdash;Two motives, then, poverty and oppre&s;&s;ion at home, and the hope of independence and wealth abroad, con|curred to draw to the United States, an a&s;toni&s;hing number of the inhabitants of Europe; and as the&s;e motives were mo&s;tly active among the very poor and very wretched, people of this de&s;cription emigrated in the greate&s;t number. Of the&s;e, the large&s;t portions fell to the &s;hare of the States of Penn&s;ylvania and New-York; and the mo&s;t worthle&s;s and profligate, proba|bly, re&s;ted in the capitals of tho&s;e States.</P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="031593_0095_0FED5156575655B0">The di&s;tre&s;&s;es in the We&s;t-Indies, e&s;pecially tho&s;e occa&s;ioned by the de&s;truction of Cape Francai&s;e, obliged numbers of the i&s;landers, white, mulatto and black, to take refuge here. This circum&s;tance, harmle&s;s, in great mea&s;ure, to the people them|&s;elves, can &s;carcely be con&s;idered as &s;o, in relation to the whole. Whatever effect it may have had, all things con&s;idered, it &s;eems irrational to &s;uppo&s;e it to have been good.</P>
<P>This collection of &s;trangers, from various parts of Europe and America, which had been rapidly form|ing for two or three years, was greatly increa&s;ed by repeated arrivals of large importations from Great-Britain and Ireland, during the fall of 1794, and the &s;pring and &s;ummer of 1795. One or two &s;hips came into this port, after the commencement of the fever, filled with emigrants.</P>
<P>If, then, the opinion of Dr. Blane, corroborated by the te&s;timony of Dr. Ru&s;h, be founded in truth; that the &s;udden intermingling of people of various and di&s;cordant habits, climates and nations, be a circum|&s;tance favoring the production of di&s;ea&s;e; this cau&s;e of fever was certainly pre&s;ent, in New-York, in the year 1795.</P>
<P N="2">II. <Q>Men who exchange their native, for a di&s;tant climate, may be con&s;idered</Q>&mdash;&s;ays Dr. Lind, page 2d, of his E&s;&s;ay on the di&s;ea&s;es incidental to Euro|peans in hot climates&mdash;<Q>as affected in a manner &s;omewhat analogous to plants removed into a foreign &s;oil; where the utmo&s;t care and attention are required to keep them in health, and to inure them to their new &s;ituation; &s;ince, thus tran&s;-planted, &s;ome change mu&s;t happen in the con&s;ti|tutions of both.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="031593_0096_0FED5159DFA91A40">"Some climates"&mdash;he continues&mdash;<Q>are healthy and favorable to European con&s;titutions, as &s;ome &s;oils are favorable to the production of European plants. But mo&s;t of the countries beyond the limits of Europe, which are frequented by Europeans, un|fortunately, prove very unhealthy to them.</Q></P>
<P>The healthine&s;s and unhealthine&s;s of a climate, or the effect wrought on the human con&s;titution by a change of climate, mu&s;t be more or le&s;s con&s;iderable, according to the extent of its connection with other circum&s;tances. How far &s;uch a connection was ob|&s;ervable in this city, in re&s;pect to the Fever of 1795, will appear by and bye.</P>
<P>Two remarks may be made, concerning the emi|grants from the We&s;t-Indies. The fir&s;t is, that they generally bear the fir&s;t winter, after their arrival in the middle and northern &s;tates, better than the na|tives, while they are le&s;s incommoded by the &s;um|mer heats. The &s;econd is, that they &s;uffer le&s;s from Fevers, during the &s;ultry &s;ea&s;on, than Emigrants from Europe. It &s;eems difficult to explain the fir&s;t men|tioned fact; the &s;econd I &s;hall attempt to account for, hereafter.</P>
<P>The climate of this part of America differs from that of Great-Britain and Ireland in the inten&s;er cold of its winters; more extreme and longer continued heat of its &s;ummers; and the greater variablene&s;s of its temperature.</P>
<P>The great body of emigrants come over to Ame|rica in large companies, crouded together in one &s;hip, and ill-accommodated in every re&s;pect. After a long voyage, under &s;uch circum&s;tances, they mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible, in an uncommon degree, to the influence of a new climate, and to every &s;udden variation of
<PB N="84" REF="031593_0097_0FED515B991BE6F8">
temperature. If they arrive, as is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> ca&s;e, in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ltry &s;ea&s;on, the effects of a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> climate mu&s;t be felt in all their force. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> of the &s;ummer mu&s;t render them le&s;s <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> be ruggedne&s;s of the following <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> the winter makes them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> the &s;corching fun of the &s;ucceeding <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> will account for the &s;uffering of many <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> a &s;ea&s;on in the country before.</P>
<P>To this it may be added, that, in 1795, the cli|mate mu&s;t have been particularly bad; &s;ince it may be &s;uppo&s;ed to have preternaturally affected the na|tives of the country. This being admitted, it is not difficult to conceive of its having had a pernicious influence on &s;trangers; and being, therefore, fairly enumerable among the cau&s;es predi&s;po&s;ing to the fever of this &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P N="3">III. An animal diet, or a great u&s;e of animal food, e&s;pecially in &s;ummer, and when there is general di&s;|po&s;ition to fevers, is thought by many phy&s;icians, of our own and other countries, to favor their produc|tion; and a vegetable diet, on the contrary, to be a preventative, or pre&s;ervative, again&s;t them. This, al&s;o, was the opinion of the humane and celebrated Howard, who is known to have ab&s;tained from the u&s;e of fle&s;h, for many years previous to his death.&mdash; Both theory and fact &s;eem to concur in e&s;tabli&s;hing the truth of this doctrine; for a &s;atisfactory illu&s;tra|tion of which I may &s;afely refer you to the publica|tions of Drs. Ru&s;h and Mitchill.</P>
<P>The proportion of animal, to vegetable food, eaten at the be&s;t provided tables in America, is &s;o great as to a&s;toni&s;h a European. This may be &s;aid of the country generally&mdash;but is e&s;pecially true
<PB N="85" REF="031593_0098_0FED515E89BED7B0">
of the cities of New-York and Philadelphia. An objection, too, has been made by Europeans, particu|larly by the French, to our mode of cooking meats. They complain, and with apparent ju&s;tice, of the im|perfect action which fire is allowed to exert upon them; and repre&s;ent us as little better than the Aby|&s;inians, who devour a part of the ox, while he is yet expiring.&mdash;It is certain that a great change is ob&s;erv|able in the appearance and kind of di&s;ea&s;es, in the United States, &s;ince our citizens have &s;ub&s;tituted fre&s;h meats, for &s;alted, in &s;ummer.&mdash;Some rea&s;ons may be a&s;&s;igned for this effect, which would countenance the opinion of the French; but they will &s;ugge&s;t them&s;elves to your own mind, and would require more room than I can allow them, in this place.&mdash; But, &s;urely, if meats be prejudicial to health, in our hot &s;ea&s;ons; if they expo&s;e us, by their u&s;e, to di&s;ea&s;es of the kind, which prevailed here, la&s;t year; how pe|culiarly mu&s;t this evil have been felt by us, when they were in a condition &s;o uncommonly bad as the year 1795&mdash;If the wealthy often had meats brought upon their tables, in a &s;tate of incipient putre&s;cency, what mu&s;t have been the &s;tate of tho&s;e which were con&s;umed by the poor?&mdash;Add to this, that the vege|tables principally u&s;ed among us, are not di&s;tingui&s;hed for their a&s;ce&s;cency.&mdash;The&s;e remarks apply to all ranks of our inhabitants; and plainly &s;hew that the &s;ituation of our city, the la&s;t year, was unu&s;ually bad, in this re&s;pect, for natives, as well as foreigners. Other circum&s;tances a&s;&s;i&s;ted to heighten the evil, in relation to the&s;e la&s;t.</P>
<P>The poor of Europe, and e&s;pecially of Ireland, are but &s;paringly accu&s;tomed to the u&s;e of meat. In that i&s;land, it is not uncommon for people to pa&s;s through life, without ever having ta&s;ted it, except by &s;tealth, accident, or on holydays.&mdash;In this country, the great
<PB N="86" REF="031593_0099_0FED5161C31F3D78">
u&s;e of meat produces a comparative &s;cantine&s;s in the &s;upply of vegetables; and a proportionate poorne&s;s and dearne&s;s of them. This is &s;ufficient to determine the choice of the poor towards the u&s;e of meat; and produce, in the emigrant poor, an almo&s;t total and &s;udden change, in their aliment. When, too, we re|collect that animal food is more gratifying to a de|praved ta&s;te; that it provokes to greater repletion, than vegetable food; that it is more nece&s;&s;ary to hard laborers; and that it is mo&s;t craved by tho&s;e who in|dulge in the habitual u&s;e of ardent &s;pirits; we are alive, at once, to the full perception of the mi&s;chiev|ous effects ari&s;ing from &s;uch a &s;ub&s;titute, to their for|mer bland and &s;canty meals. In tho&s;e, with whom this change of diet took place the la&s;t year, for the fir&s;t, the con&s;equences mu&s;t have been &s;till more per|nicious. For we ought to con&s;ider that if the poor always con&s;ume the wor&s;t provi&s;ions, tho&s;e who were &s;trangers, as well as poor, were lea&s;t likely to procure tho&s;e which were good; and the &s;lighte&s;t ob&s;ervation is &s;ufficient to convince us, that their bad qualities could not have been much obviated by the prepara|tion common among the con&s;umers.</P>
<P>May we not, then, conclude&mdash;that the aliment u&s;ed by the citizens, generally, was favorable to the production of di&s;ea&s;e&mdash;and that the great and &s;udden change of diet, among the emigrants, con&s;idering the nature of their food in 1795, mu&s;t have di&s;po&s;ed them, in a particular manner, to be affected by the fever of the country?</P>
<P N="4">IV. If unwhole&s;ome aliment a&s;&s;i&s;ted in the produc|tion, or aggravation, of the fever of 1795, improper drinks were &s;carcely le&s;s active, to the &s;ame end.&mdash; The u&s;e of ardent &s;pirits, among all cla&s;&s;es of citi|zens, and e&s;pecially among the laboring cla&s;&s;es, is a&s;|toni&s;hingly

great and general, throughout the United States. No country in the world, in all probability, con&s;umes an equal quantity, in proportion to its po|pulation. In vain has the eloquence of the mo&s;t en|lightened phy&s;icians and morali&s;ts been exerted again&s;t them, for centuries: governments con&s;titute it the intere&s;t of individuals to prepare and circulate them; they withhold from men that knowledge which would teach them to &s;hun, or elevate them above the u&s;e of, intoxicating liquors; and prejudices are excited and fo&s;tered in their favor, that the igno|rant and depraved, to whom they form a congenial gratification, may continue to con&s;ume them; to the de&s;truction of morals, the emolument of di&s;tillers, and the augmentation of the revenue. As they are more ea&s;ily and cheaply obtained in America, than in Eu|rope; as the wages of laborers are more con&s;iderable here, than there, and therefore permit them greater indulgences; as there is every encouragement from example; and as a fiercer &s;un, according to common notions, ju&s;tifies a more prodigal u&s;e of them; it is naturally &s;uppo&s;eable that the emigrants of the la|boring cla&s;s indulged in them, to an unu&s;ual degree. Unque&s;tionably, the u&s;e of intoxicating liquors was highly pernicious to tho&s;e mo&s;t accu&s;tomed to them; to tho&s;e not &s;o habituated, it was, as unque&s;tionably, &s;till more pernicious. In Philadelphia in 1793, when the fever was prevalent, Dr. Ru&s;h remarks that&mdash;<Q>a plentiful meal, and a <HI>few extra gla&s;&s;es of wine,</HI> &s;el|dom failed of exciting the fever.</Q> With us the di&s;ea&s;e was le&s;s ferocious and le&s;s active; but, as if no means of cau&s;ing it to become more &s;o were to be neglected, an idea was, mo&s;t unhappily circulated &mdash;and, it &s;hould &s;eem, was countenanced by per&s;ons bearing the title of phy&s;icians,&mdash;that free living, the plentiful u&s;e of vinous and ardent liquors, was a pow|erful

preventative of the fever. The dreadful con|&s;equences which a belief of this &s;ort produced, were numerous, and &s;hocking to the la&s;t degree. The fear of death, &s;o active in ignorant minds, when once arou&s;ed; idlene&s;s, the parent of every vice, and li&s;t|le&s;&s;ne&s;s, the con&s;equence of want of employment; all con&s;pired, with this pernicious doctrine, to effect the ruin of numbers. Never, I believe, was drunkene&s;s &s;o common. Not a day pa&s;&s;ed that I did not meet per|&s;ons reeling through the &s;treets, or &s;tretched on the pavement&mdash;&s;ometimes in the noon-day &s;un, un&s;hel|tered, and &s;ometimes expo&s;ed to the heavie&s;t rains. I have &s;een three men, lying in this condition, in one little &s;treet. The&s;e were all, as you may &s;uppo&s;e, among the mo&s;t depraved of our poor; and mo&s;t of them were foreigners.</P>

<P><Q>No direct, no clear evidence ever has been, or can be produced, in favor of the opinion that the Fever was imported.</Q></P>
<P>The authority on which the advocates of importa|tion chiefly re&s;t, for the &s;upport of their doctrine, is, as far as I can di&s;cover, the letter of the Health Com|mittee to the Governor, of the 8th of September
<PB N="96" REF="031593_0109_0FED5180AC2711F0">
1795; or, more properly, on what is there reported to be the fact.&mdash;I &s;hall quote, from this letter, the pa&s;&s;age referred to.</P>
<P><Q>On the 20th day of July, Doctor Malachi Treat, the late Health-Officer of this port, vi&s;ited the brig Zephyr, from Port-au-Prince; on board of which he found three per&s;ons ill of fever, and the corp&s;e of one who died that morning. The Doctor calls the Fever, in his report, a Bilious-remitting Fever. The brig was ordered to ride quarantine. On the 22d day of July, Dr. Treat was taken ill, and died on the 30th, of a fever marked by a yellow &s;kin, hemorrhages, vomiting of black matter, re&s;embling coffee-grounds, and all &s;uch &s;ymptoms as charac|terize bilious fevers of the malignant kind.&mdash;On the 25th day of July, four per&s;ons, from on board the &s;hip William, from Liverpool, which arrived here &s;everal weeks before (all the crew having, previous to that day, and during the voyage, been perfectly healthy) were taken ill of Fever, attended with &s;imilar &s;ymptoms; and all died within &s;even days.</Q></P>
<P><Q>This &s;hip lay at a wharf at the foot of Dover-&s;treet, in the <HI>&s;outh-ea&s;terly</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A mi&s;take of the Pre&s;s for&mdash;<HI>north-ea&s;terly.</HI></NOTE> part of this city, which lies exceedingly low, is much of it made-ground, has an ea&s;tern expo&s;ure, and (from the &s;treets hav|ing been rai&s;ed, about three years ago, which threw the lots and yards into hollows of con&s;iderable depth) is almo&s;t unavoidably liable to great collec|tions of offal, and filth of all kinds; is a part of the town very much crowded by poor inhabitants, and contains a great number of lodging-hou&s;es, in which &s;eamen and &s;trangers of the poorer cla&s;s, com|monly
<PB N="97" REF="031593_0110_0FED5183B9ABBBA0">
re&s;ide; and ever has &s;uffered mo&s;t from the regular autumnal di&s;ea&s;es, as well as from any new and uncommon complaint. From all which cir|cum&s;tances, we entertain no doubt but that the &s;eamen of the &s;hip William contracted the di&s;ea&s;e, of which they died, here, and did not introduce it into the city.</Q></P>
<P><Q>A little before, and immediately after, the attack of the &s;eamen of the &s;hip William, which fir&s;t called the attention of this Committee, &s;everal other per&s;ons, in Water and Front-&s;treets, and in the neighborhood of Dover-&s;treet, were &s;eized with fever, which, e&s;pecially in tho&s;e ca&s;es which proved mortal, was marked by &s;evere vomitings, a yellow &s;kin, hemorrhagy, and, in &s;ome ca&s;es, a vomiting a black matter, re&s;embling coffee-grounds,&mdash;and which generally terminated within &s;even days, and proved fatal to more, in proportion to the number &s;eized, than is u&s;ual in the ordinary complaints of the &s;ea&s;on, in this city.</Q></P>
<P>Two remarks of con&s;iderable importance are natu|rally &s;ugge&s;ted by a careful examination of the above quotation: Fir&s;t, that the Committee appear to have &s;uppo&s;ed Dr. Treat, alone, to have received the di&s;|ea&s;e of which he died, from the Zephyr; and, &s;e|condly, that they have, in &s;ome &s;ort, admitted the po&s;&s;ibility of &s;uch a di&s;ea&s;e as the Fever of 1795, originating here, in their &s;tatement of the circum|&s;tances relative to the &s;hip William. It is true that they are inexplicit, in both in&s;tances; and the only ab&s;olute conclu&s;ion which we are ju&s;tified in deduc|ing from what they &s;ay is, that the di&s;ea&s;e was not introduced into this city by the &s;hip William. This, however, narrows the ground of controver&s;y, con&s;i|derably; for no ve&s;&s;els be&s;ide the William and the
<PB N="98" REF="031593_0111_0FED518896B25938">
Zephyr, as far as I can learn, have ever been &s;u&s;pected of introducing any di&s;ea&s;e, of this kind, into this city. It is nece&s;&s;ary, therefore, only to di&s;prove the a&s;&s;er|tion, in re&s;pect to the Zephyr, and the whole founda|tion of the doctrine of importation is de&s;troyed.&mdash; But, even were we to admit that Dr. Treat did actu|ally derive the fever of which he died, from the Ze|phyr, as no other per&s;on is known to have been in|fected by that ve&s;&s;el, and as the doctor communi|cated it to no per&s;on, the advocates for importation would not be greatly benefited by our conce&s;&s;ion. But, no &s;uch conce&s;&s;ion is nece&s;&s;ary. The following papers, copies of which I am kindly permitted to tran&s;mit to you, appear to me, to e&s;tabli&s;h it, beyond contradiction, that neither Dr. Treat, nor any other per&s;on, contracted a Fever, &s;uch as prevailed in New-York, in 1795, from any &s;ick, or dead, man, or any thing el&s;e, connected with the ve&s;&s;el in que&s;tion.</P>

<P>OF the undoubted veracity of Captain Bird I am a&s;&s;ured by Dr. Dingley, who is per&s;onally acquainted with him, and attended him, at the time, for the dy&s;entery mentioned in the depo&s;ition. The opinion, therefore, that the Yellow Fever, or a contagious di&s;ea&s;e, was brought into the city, la&s;t year, by the brig Zephyr, &s;eems wholly un&s;upported by evidence. Neither is it nece&s;&s;ary that any imputation &s;hould re&s;t on the memory of Dr. Treat. He &s;aw the mariners after they had been long affected by the Fever and ague, and perhaps with &s;ome fever upon them at the time; and from the yellowne&s;s of the &s;kin, common to the ad|vanced &s;tate of that di&s;ea&s;e, e&s;pecially in hot climates, might be ea&s;ily induced to &s;uppo&s;e it a remittent. This, however, is mere conjecture, and not nece&s;&s;ary to be admitte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;ince the fact of the men having been &s;ick &s;eventeen days, previous to their embarking for our coa&s;t, is ample proof that their could not have been affected by the fever which prevailed and was
<PB N="101" REF="031593_0114_0FED519035E9B260">
&s;o mortal, here.&mdash;Indeed, the whole te&s;timony in favor of the idea of importation, is too loo&s;e and &s;light to build any rational opinion upon. The very words of the Committee are calculated to &s;trengthen a con|trary opinion, if rightly con&s;idered; for they not only countenance the idea that the people of the &s;hip Wil|liam became &s;ick from the unhealthine&s;s of the place where they dwelt, but, al&s;o, that the Fever had made its appearance, in various other of the neighboring hou&s;es and &s;treets, previous to their being &s;eized with it. And what confirms the truth of this opinion is, that per&s;ons were taken with the di&s;temper, about this time, in other parts of the city, who had no connection with the brig Zephyr, nor with any other ve&s;&s;el, and who&s;e illne&s;s may be &s;atisfactorily ac|counted for from their &s;ituation, in other re&s;pects. An in&s;tance of this kind fell under my own ob&s;erva|tion, the la&s;t of July; &s;everal &s;imilar ca&s;es have been related to me; and one, if I am not mi&s;informed, occurred in the New-York Alms-hou&s;e, where the di&s;ea&s;e was di&s;tinctly marked, before Dr. Treat's ill|ne&s;s.&mdash;The following &s;tatement of facts, too, will convince every candid mind, that we ought to look at home, for the cau&s;e of this Fever.</P>
<P>The &s;hip Connecticut came to Fitch's wharf, about the 20th of July&mdash;I think it was on the 21&s;t: &s;he had ju&s;t arrived from &s;ome part of England, and the people were perfectly healthy. No ve&s;&s;el &s;u&s;pected of being infected, came to this wharf, during the &s;ea&s;on; though the &s;hip William lay at the next wharf, at the di&s;tance of about two hundred feet,&mdash;and Mr. Fitch gives the mo&s;t po&s;itive a&s;&s;uran|ces that all the articles in his &s;tore, at this time, were in good condition. At this wharf the &s;hip Connec|ticut continued till after the middle of Augu&s;t. The owner was employed about the &s;hip, great part of
<PB N="102" REF="031593_0115_0FED5194C78E8260">
the day; but ate and &s;lept in an airy part of the town. The people of the &s;hip either &s;tayed on board, or at public hou&s;es near by.&mdash;On the evening of the 25th of July, the owner was &s;eized with the fever; I &s;aw him the 27th; he had good accommodations, was in a favorable part of the town, in the third &s;tory of the hou&s;e, and recovered after an illne&s;s of about ten days, which was never very dangerous, though the attack was &s;evere.&mdash;About this time, one of the mates, the &s;teward, and two of the mariners, of the &s;hip Con|necticut, were &s;eized in the &s;ame way, and with the &s;ame &s;ymptoms, as the owner. They continued in the &s;hip, or its neighborhood, and all died. I did not &s;ee them, but was informed, by the owner, that the mate, in particular, <HI>vomited large quantities of blood, and expired delirious.</HI></P>
<P>Three per&s;ons, who were in Mr. Fitch's &s;tore, were taken &s;ick, and two died, of the Fever. One &s;ickened on the 26th of July, one on the 6th, and the other on the 9th of Augu&s;t. It was common for all the&s;e per&s;ons to &s;it <Q>&s;everal hours, in the morn|ing, in the &s;tore, with empty &s;tomachs,&mdash;inhaling the effluvia of the night.</Q></P>
<P>One of the fir&s;t per&s;ons, who died of the Fever, was one <Q>who lived at the head of the wharf, and had been confined for &s;everal months with a rheu|matic complaint.</Q></P>
<P>For the facts contained in the two la&s;t paragraphs, I am indebted to a communication from Mr. Fitch to Dr. Dingley, which that gentleman has allowed me to make u&s;e of on this occa&s;ion. The account which it contains of the condition of the wharves in his neighborhood, adds new force to the other te&s;timony in favor of the opinion that the Fever originated here; and is too much to the purpo&s;e to be omitted. The&s;e are his words:&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="031593_0116_0FED5197E72BADF0"><Q>I am po&s;itive that the di&s;order has originated from local cau&s;es&mdash;becau&s;e, it has appeared in this quarter, at the &s;ame &s;ea&s;on, for &s;everal years pa&s;t: the cau&s;e why it has is, to me, my&s;terious; but what appears to me mo&s;t probable is, the central &s;ituation, and the motion of the tides. The tide of flood &s;ets directly into the&s;e wharves; col|lecting all the vapors and effluvia of the city.&mdash; The &s;ituation of the ground, between Water and Cherry-&s;treets, is rendered noxious by rai&s;ing Water-&s;treet, and confining the &s;tagnant waters.&mdash; The emptying of tubs into the head of the docks, in&s;tead of the end of the wharves, although not peculiar to this part of the city, is a horrible nui|&s;ance; particularly in time of &s;ickne&s;s.&mdash;The pon|ding of water, by running a bulk-head athwart a dock, and leaving the vacancy for years, to be filled up with every &s;pecies of filth and putridity, is an object worth your attention.</Q></P>
<P>A confirmation of the facts, and &s;ome of the opi|nions, contained in this extract, may be found in a very &s;ingular epi&s;tle from the late Dr. W^m^.

<P>On the whole, though I am not prepared to main|tain that infectious di&s;ea&s;es, and the Yellow Fever among others, may not be, and have not been, im|ported, and thus &s;pread over parts of our country, yet this is the mo&s;t that can be allowed to the coun|tenancers of the doctrine. For, after all, the te&s;ti|mony of numerous facts furni&s;hes clear, indubitable, and deci&s;ive evidence, that other and peculiar cir|cum&s;tances mu&s;t concur with &s;uch importation, to
<PB N="104" REF="031593_0117_0FED51999BC6C378">
effect any general di&s;tribution, circulation, or influ|ence of the di&s;ea&s;e. Frequent in&s;tances have occurred, nay do occur every year, of per&s;ons returning, from the We&s;t-Indies, &s;ick with the Yellow Fever; lan|gui&s;hing, for &s;ome time, in the hou&s;es of their pa|rents, or friends; recovering, or dying; attended by numbers, during their illne&s;s; their very clothes, where they have died, afterwards worn by their re|lations; and yet no ill effects following therefrom.&mdash; While I re&s;ided at Wethersfield, in Connecticut, I had opportunity of obtaining preci&s;e information of &s;everal &s;uch ca&s;es; and it is a well-e&s;tabli&s;hed fact, in many in&s;tances during our Fever, and e&s;pecially dur|ing that of Philadelphia, in 1793.</P>
<P>The whole, therefore, that can be granted, or ought to be a&s;&s;umed by tho&s;e who maintain the di&s;|ea&s;e which prevailed in New-York in 1795, to have been imported is,&mdash;That infection may be brought into any place (and therefore into this city) from abroad; that, under certain circum&s;tances of the place, where it is introduced, it becomes very active and de&s;tructive; but that, when the&s;e circum&s;tances do not exi&s;t, however the per&s;on immediately af|fected,&mdash;if it be introduced by a &s;ick per&s;on&mdash;may &s;uffer, it is harmle&s;s, &s;o far as the general health of that place is concerned.&mdash;If the &s;ubject were viewed in this light, as mo&s;t a&s;&s;uredly it ought to be, the que&s;tion of importation, or non-importation, would &s;ink into it's merited in&s;ignificance; the efficient cau&s;e, the <HI>cau&s;a fine qua non,</HI> of &s;uch Fevers, would be clearly di&s;cerned as depending on local circum|&s;tances, capable of being wholly changed; the ab&s;o|lute madne&s;s of further delay, in effecting &s;uch a change, would be di&s;tinctly and deeply felt; a becom|ing &s;pirit would animate the citizens; and &s;uitable exertions &s;peedily place us beyond the po&s;&s;ibility of

being &s;ubjected to a misfortune, &s;imilar to that which has been already &s;u&s;tained. For it is inconceivable that the nature and extent of the evil &s;hould be un|der&s;tood, and the remedy not be applied: and a comparatively &s;light and temporaly &s;acrifice of pro|perty, would render this city, in reality, what the mi&s;taken policy, or pride, of &s;ome of its inhabitants now fal&s;ely repre&s;ent it,&mdash;as healthy as any in the world; and leave nothing to fear, either from the Fevers of the Indies, or the Plague of the Levant.&mdash;But, while people continue to fo&s;ter a ridiculous vanity, con|cerning the city in which they re&s;ide; while they fear that its reputation will be wounded, by permitting an idea to get abroad, that it is unhealthy; while tho&s;e engaged in commerce cheri&s;h the error, from an apprehen&s;ion that their intere&s;ts would &s;uffer from a di&s;clo&s;ure of the truth; while men, inve&s;ted with the &s;acred character of phy&s;icians, countenance fal&s;e opinions, either through ignorance, a reprehen&s;ible ti|midity, or that they may gather unde&s;erved popularity and wealth; and while the magi&s;tracy are more actuated by a mean regard for offices dependent on popular opi|nion, and maintained by a compliance with it, at all hazards, than by a ju&s;t and enlightened zeal for the &s;afety and happine&s;s of their fellow-citizens; Truth may be &s;poken, but there is no hope that it will be attended to. Con&s;iderations of <HI>&s;uppo&s;ed</HI> intere&s;t, &s;o various and &s;o forcible, take deep root in the minds of men who look only to the pre&s;ent moment, and are either incapable of comprehending the whole of a &s;ubject, or unwilling to be&s;tow on it the nece&s;&s;ary con&s;ideration. Thus circum&s;tanced, they &s;trive to bani&s;h from others, and to &s;mother in their own brea&s;ts, tho&s;e convictions which irre&s;i&s;tible evidence forces upon them: as if it were po&s;&s;ible that truth could be noxious.&mdash;Nothing can be more melancho|ly than to ob&s;erve this wilful blindne&s;s, this ob&s;ti|nate per&s;i&s;tency in error, the con&s;equences of which

<HEAD><HI>LETTER SEVENTH.</HI> Was the Fever of <HI>1795</HI> an Epidemic? Was it Con|tagious?</HEAD>
<P>HAVING determined, to my own &s;atisfaction at lea&s;t, what were the remote or predi&s;po&s;ing cau&s;es of the Fever of 1795, I might now proceed to a de&s;cription of the di&s;ea&s;e it&s;elf, were it not proper to take &s;ome notice of two que&s;tions, which have been con&s;idera|tion agitated, viz. Whether the Fever was, as the Health Committee term it, an Epidemic?&mdash;And, as &s;ome &s;uppo&s;e, Contagious?&mdash;On both the&s;e que&s;tions, I &s;hall deliver my opinion, in as &s;uccinct a manner as the &s;ubject will permit.</P>
<P><HI>Was the Fever epidemic?</HI>&mdash;A principal difficulty oc|curs in the very out&s;et of this enquiry; for different writers have made u&s;e of the term Epidemic, diffe|rently; &s;ome giving it a <HI>general,</HI> others a more <HI>particu|lar</HI> and <HI>preci&s;e</HI> &s;ignification. Thus Van Swieten, in his Commentary on the 1380th Aphori&s;m of Boerhaave, places <HI>epidemic</HI> in contradi&s;tinction to <HI>endemic;</HI> while Cleghorn, a writer of de&s;erved authority, in the In|troduction to his Ob&s;ervations on the Di&s;ea&s;es, &amp;c.

of Minorca, p. 74. con&s;titutes a cla&s;s of <HI>endemic</HI> di&s;|ea&s;es, which he divides into <HI>epidemic</HI> and <HI>&s;poradic.</HI>&mdash; Examples of like di&s;&s;imilarities, in the u&s;e of the&s;e words, are frequently to be met with, in authors of equal credit. And thus it may po&s;&s;ibly happen, in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance, as on many former occa&s;ions, that the whole contention ari&s;es from different con|ceptions of the import of a particular word.&mdash;But our bu&s;ine&s;s is rather with facts, than with definitions; I &s;hall &s;tate to you, therefore, what appears to me to have been the truth; and, perhaps, in the conclu&s;ion of my &s;tatement, a definition will be found.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, every per&s;on conver&s;ant with the practice of phy&s;ic in New-York, knows that a Fever, generally of the remittent or continued kind, and va|riou&s;ly denominated by medical writers, prevails in this city, to a greater or le&s;s degree, every year; per|haps I may &s;ay throughout the year&mdash;but, certainly, in every part of it, except the winter, and particularly from July to December: its greate&s;t height being in the months of Augu&s;t, September and October. The violence of this di&s;ea&s;e is increa&s;ed or dimini&s;hed by con&s;titutional peculiarities, and by the particular &s;itu|ation of the patient in re&s;pect to air, temperature, &amp;c. &amp;c. Its univer&s;ality, likewi&s;e, may be con&s;idered as dependent, in a degree, on the &s;ame cau&s;es.&mdash;Cir|cum&s;tances, peculiar to &s;ome &s;ituations or individuals, occa&s;ion it to prove mortal, with high marks of ma|lignity, in certain in&s;tances, almo&s;t every year. That an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ten&s;ion of the&s;e peculiarities, &s;o as to make them common to the citizens generally, would pro|duce the &s;ame effects on the many, as on the few, &s;eems hardly controvertible. Now, this appears, to me, to have been the ca&s;e, the la&s;t year; and I have no doubt of the identity of the Fever which then raged here, with that which has prevailed here in
<PB N="108" REF="031593_0121_0FED51A7EB800838">
former years; and con&s;ider it only as a higher grade of the &s;ame di&s;ea&s;e.&mdash;Compare the hi&s;tory of Fevers, in Sheffield, with that of Fevers in New-York.&mdash;We have a Fever, every year, at a particular &s;ea&s;on, u&s;u|ally called the bilious-remitting Fever: in Sheffield, at the &s;ame &s;ea&s;on, a Fever prevails, called the inter|mitting Fever. This la&s;t evidently depends on the peculiarities of Sheffield&mdash;&s;uch as its ponds, mar&s;hes, &amp;c.&mdash;So, in my opinion, does the former ari&s;e from the peculiarities of New-York.&mdash;The &s;ea&s;on of 1795 was a remarkable one: Was there any apparent change in the Fever o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Sheffield? Yes: the &s;ymp|toms were remarkably heightened; &s;ome new ap|pearances were ob&s;ervable; and the di&s;ea&s;e a&s;toni&s;h|ingly ob&s;tinate. And was not this, al&s;o, true of New-York? Who will venture to deny it?&mdash;Were either of the&s;e Fevers propagated to other, or neighboring, places? No. You have certified this of the Fever in Sheffield; and I have heard of no in&s;tance of the kind, in relation to that of New-York. Both Fevers, then, were <HI>proper</HI> to the places in which they prevailed; and the inference which it would be natural to deduce from this is, that both were <HI>endemic,</HI> and not <HI>epidemic:</HI> for the term epidemic &s;eems to include in it the ca|pability of diffu&s;ion or propagation, without re&s;pect to the &s;ituation and con&s;titution of the patient; which the term endemic certainly does not. But, which-ever of the&s;e titles may be regarded as mo&s;t appropri|ate, the fact will not be varied by the u&s;e of either; and that you will under&s;tand to be, according to my belief, as above-&s;tated. That the Fever of 1795 was no other than a higher grade of that which prevails here, in the &s;ame &s;ea&s;on, every year; deriving its &s;e|verity entirely from the peculiarities of the &s;ea&s;on, &amp;c. as related, at large, in the preceding letters.</P>

<P>If by the que&s;tion it is meant to inquire, whether the well became affected with the Fever, in con&s;e|quence of the contact of a &s;ick per&s;on, or the cloath|ing of a &s;ick per&s;on, or from the performance of the offices of friend&s;hip, charity, and meniality, to tho&s;e who were &s;ick,&mdash;I an&s;wer that no &s;uch ca&s;es have come to my knowledge; whereas numerous in&s;tances of &s;uch contact fell under my ob&s;ervation, and have been related to me, to which no ill effects &s;ucceeded.</P>
<P>A number of per&s;ons, not le&s;s than ten or twelve, removed, with the Fever on them, from New-York to Stamford, 40 miles; but no per&s;on in Stamford, be&s;ide them, ever had the di&s;order.</P>
<P>Mr. Fitch, the gentleman mentioned in the pre|ceding letter, attended the young men who had the di&s;ea&s;e with him, and to u&s;e his own words, <Q>lodged in the bed, warm with the effluvia of the body of the young man who died at his hou&s;e</Q>&mdash;and ne|verthele&s;s, he had no Fever.</P>
<P>Dr. Treat, according to the account of the Health-Committee, and of his phy&s;icians, died of the very wor&s;t degree of the Fever; yet he communicated it to nobody.</P>
<P>A patient of Dr. Dingley's, in Ferry-&s;treet, who was &s;eized with the di&s;ea&s;e, without any previous communication with any &s;ick per&s;on, and as early as the 17th of Augu&s;t, and who died with it, commu|nicated it to none of his attendants. And the &s;ame is true of &s;everal other patients of the &s;ame gentle|man.</P>

<P>But there would be no end to an enumeration of &s;imilar facts; I &s;hall only add, therefore, that I made u&s;e of no precaution whatever, in re&s;pect to &s;uch com|munication with patients; that I have been, for more than two hours, &s;hut up in a &s;mall room, with a per|&s;on laboring under the wor&s;t &s;ymptoms of the Fever; have watched &s;everal nights, and performed the mo&s;t &s;ervile offices, with a near friend, who was &s;ick with it; and never &s;u&s;tained the lea&s;t inconvenience from &s;uch expo&s;ures<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I might &s;uperadd to all this, the <HI>ambiguous</HI> te&s;timony of another Phy&s;ician, who, in proof of the uninfectious nature of the Fever, affirmed that he had <Q>had thirty patients with it, and had <HI>taken the breath of all of them.</HI></Q></NOTE>.</P>
<P>But, perhaps the advocates for the Contagious, or Infectious, nature of the di&s;ea&s;e under con&s;ideration, do not intend to confine the meaning of the term Con|tagion to that &s;ub&s;tance, whatever it is, which is ge|nerated in an unhealthy body, and by application to a &s;ound body, excites in it a &s;imilar unhealthine&s;s.

about words. Perhaps, the following &s;tatement of my opinions, will lead us to the formation or attain|ment of &s;ome more accurate notions on this point.</P>
<P>Owing to a variety of cau&s;es, which have been enumerated in the cour&s;e of the&s;e letters, I &s;uppo&s;e the atmo&s;phere of New-York to have become vi|tiated, in 1795, to an uncommon degree: that there was either an unu&s;ual ab&s;ence of that principle nece&s;|&s;ary to &s;upport healthy life, or an extraordinary con|centration, diffu&s;ion, or quantity, of &s;ome other, un|friendly to healthy life. From the operation of one, or other, of the&s;e &s;tates of the atmo&s;phere, and of the cau&s;es above-mentioned, on the bodies of the re&s;idents in this city, I &s;uppo&s;e a predi&s;po&s;ition, greater or le&s;s, according to the &s;ituation and other circum&s;tances of individuals, was formed, in the citi|zens, generally, to the Fever which prevailed here that year. With &s;ome per&s;ons, this condition of the atmo&s;phere, of it&s;elf, might be &s;ufficient to produce in them di&s;ea&s;e. But, ordinarily, I believe, the aid of &s;ome cau&s;e, which &s;hould di&s;turb the regularity of the di&s;tributions, or functions, of the body, was re|quired to bring the &s;y&s;tem into a &s;tate of febrile ac|tion. Such, for in&s;tance, as intemperance in eating or drinking, &s;udden fright, fatigue, or indeed, any con&s;iderable irregularity in what Sy&s;tematics call the Non-Naturals.</P>
<P>This condition of the atmo&s;phere, I &s;uppo&s;e, ac|quired &s;trength, daily, as the &s;ea&s;on advanced; or, in other words, the power of the atmo&s;phere, &amp;c. to predi&s;po&s;e to the Fever, was increa&s;ed, as the &s;ea&s;on progre&s;&s;ed. I &s;ay to predi&s;po&s;e,&mdash;for I &s;u&s;pect it &s;el|dom, of it&s;elf, produced the di&s;ea&s;e, after that had at|tained its height, in tho&s;e who remained here con|&s;tantly.

Though, on per&s;ons coming into the city, from abroad, it doubtle&s;s operated with much greater force, in many ca&s;es, than on the citizens, at any time. This is ea&s;ily accounted for, from the known effects of cu&s;tom. For

<P>The &s;y&s;tems of tho&s;e who continued here became habituated to the atmo&s;phere; and while tho&s;e who came here from the country, with ruddy faces, &s;unk down in death, the pale and yellow beings who &s;talked through our &s;treets, derided di&s;ea&s;e, and pur&s;ued their cu&s;tomary occupations.&mdash;But, to return from this di|gre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Not only am I convinced of the accuracy of the preceding ideas, but I have no doubt that this vice of the atmo&s;phere was rendered &s;till greater by exhala|tions from the bodies of the &s;ick&mdash;It is a point well-e&s;tabli&s;hed in medicine, that the air of a room is rendered un&s;uitable for re&s;piration, if a num|ber of healthy per&s;ons are obliged to breathe it over &s;everal times, without the admi&s;&s;ion of fre&s;h air from abroad. So injurious is &s;uch a confinement, in re|&s;pect to air, to the human body, that it has, in nume|rous in&s;tances, produced terrible febrile di&s;ea&s;es. And if &s;uch effects ari&s;e from the repeated breathing over the &s;ame, or nearly the &s;ame, air, by healthy per&s;ons, we &s;hould naturally conclude, as is the fact, that &s;uch repeated re&s;piration (e&s;pecially when united with the con&s;tant exhalation from their bodies) by the &s;ick, mu&s;t be &s;till more pernicious to health.&mdash;You will pardon me for the introduction of remarks &s;o trite and familiar, for the &s;ake of the u&s;e I wi&s;h to make of them; which is no other than this&mdash;I have mention|ed

it as my belief that the &s;tate of the atmo&s;phere was &s;uch, in this city, the la&s;t year, as, in conjunction with the general influence of the cau&s;es producing that &s;tate, to predi&s;po&s;e to, and, in &s;ome in&s;tances, pro|duce, the Fever; and that this ill-conditioned atmo&s;|phere was rendered &s;till more noxious by means of the numbers who became &s;ick, in the cour&s;e of the &s;ea&s;on; and to this I would add, for the rea&s;ons con|tained in the remarks above, that I think it not im|probable that &s;ome were affected with the Fever, in con&s;equence of the further vitiation of the atmo&s;phere by the &s;ick, who, without that circum&s;tance, would have remained free from di&s;ea&s;e. So, likewi&s;e, there may be per&s;ons, the balance of who&s;e health is &s;o tre|mulou&s;ly &s;en&s;ible to every external influence, as to preponderate to the &s;ide of di&s;ea&s;e, on the &s;lighte&s;t impul&s;e of its cau&s;es. With &s;uch, the mere contact of a &s;ick per&s;on, or a tran&s;itory expo&s;ure to the efflu|via ari&s;ing from a &s;ick body, may be &s;ufficient to pro|duce Fever; and in&s;tances of this kind may have hap|pened, in the cour&s;e of the Fever in que&s;tion. Such ca&s;es, however, mu&s;t have been extremely rare, if there were any; and no one has ever come to my knowledge.&mdash;But, with regard to Fevers produced by &s;uch a &s;tate of the air, as above de&s;cribed, even when aided by the mixture of human effluvia, ari&s;ing from &s;ick bodies,&mdash;if the&s;e are to be called Contagious di|&s;ea&s;es, and the cau&s;e which excited them Contagion, &s;o, likewi&s;e, may all other Fevers on the &s;ame principle, continued, remitting, intermitting, Fevers,&mdash;be called Contagious, and their cau&s;es, as mar&s;h mia&s;mata, &amp;c, Contagion.&mdash;Now, to &s;uch a u&s;e of terms I have not the lea&s;t objection, provided the per&s;on who employs them, be uniform and explicit in his application of them.</P>
<P><PB N="114" REF="031593_0127_0FED51B9C0EBC378">To conclude,&mdash;If, in &s;peaking of the Fever of 1795, the epithet Contagious is meant to expre&s;s that it was communicated by contact, &amp;c. like the Small|pox, Meazles and Plague, I mu&s;t repeat it, I find no good rea&s;on for admitting this to have been the fact; but, for the rea&s;ons before alledged, I think there is ju&s;t ground for a belief that the Fever was never ex|cited in this way. But if, on the other hand, the term Contagion be meant to convey an idea of the in|fluence of the atmo&s;phere to predi&s;po&s;e to, or pro|duce, di&s;ea&s;e,&mdash;whether that influence ari&s;e from the ab&s;traction, or addition, of a principle, or be di&s;tinct from human effluvia, or combined with them&mdash;there appears no rea&s;on for denying the Fever of 1795 to have been Contagious.&mdash;Still, as the term Contagion is not generally u&s;ed in a &s;en&s;e to re&s;tricted, as in this &s;econd in&s;tance, but is often employed by the &s;ame writer, to expre&s;s both the cau&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e com|municated by contact, &amp;c. and of that produced by the influence of the atmo&s;phere, there &s;eems to be a pro|priety in rejecting it altogether, in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance, or at lea&s;t in confining the u&s;e of it, to de&s;ignate a &s;ingle mode of producing di&s;ea&s;e; and, according as it is applied in the former or latter in&s;tance, the Fe|ver of 1795 may be denominated Contagious, or the rever&s;e.</P>

<HEAD><HI>LETTER EIGHTH.</HI> Some Account of the Symptoms of the Fever of <HI>1795.</HI></HEAD>
<P>AFTER the frequent confe&s;&s;ions, which occur in the preceding letters, of the circum&s;cribed &s;phere of my ob&s;ervation, it were pre&s;umptuous in me to pre|tend to deliver a regular hi&s;tory of the &s;ymptoms of the Fever of 1795. You will ob&s;erve, from the ac|count which I &s;hall tran&s;mit to you, that the appear|ances it exhibited were too various to authorize &s;uch an attempt in any one who had not opportunity to ex|amine them, in relation to numbers of the &s;ick. It is proper, therefore, that I warn you, once more, to con&s;ider what is here delivered as the re&s;ult of my own ob&s;ervation only&mdash;except where it is expre&s;sly mentioned to be otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>The Fever of 1795 was, generally, &s;udden in its acce&s;s; &s;o much &s;o, in &s;ome in&s;tances, as to re&s;emble convul&s;ions. In a le&s;s number of ca&s;es, it came on gradually, and after a &s;lowly-increa&s;ing illne&s;s of &s;everal days. It began with great pain of the head, heat and redne&s;s of the face, and fullne&s;s and redne&s;s of the eyes, accompanied by a &s;trong, full, ten&s;e, pul&s;e, and an almo&s;t univer&s;al co&s;tivene&s;s. Pains in the back and limbs were common; but not as much &s;o as of the head. A great inquietude, or anxiety, of the &s;tomach and brea&s;t, was common; approaching, &s;ometimes, to &s;yncope, and &s;ometimes a vomiting, which &s;oon cea&s;ed, or continued, at in|tervals, through the di&s;order.&mdash;The Fever which now commenced was rarely u&s;hered in by a chill, and con|tinued
<PB N="116" REF="031593_0129_0FED51C0D5EFE010">
for a greater or le&s;&s;er period, according to circum&s;tances, with &s;o many varieties and combina|tions of &s;ymptoms, as to render it impo&s;&s;ible to pur&s;ue a regular de&s;cription. I &s;hall, therefore, di&s;po&s;e my remarks under &s;everal heads; pre&s;erving as much connection as circum&s;tances will permit.</P>
<P N="1">I. Though the <HI>pul&s;e</HI> was generally full, &s;trong, and ten&s;e, in the beginning of the Fever, it was not always &s;o. It was &s;ometimes weak and low, but &s;till ten&s;e&mdash;if it be proper to u&s;e this term, to point out a condition of the pul&s;e, as it appears to me, wholly peculiar to this Fever. I well remember that, in youth of 12, or 13, years of age, the pul&s;e becam<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> much fuller after a plentiful bleeding; though he was of a feeble con&s;titution, and had been &s;lightly affected with the Fever once before.&mdash;In two gentlemen, who were con&s;iderably affected by the Fever, for &s;everal weeks, but not to &s;uch a degree as to be confined to their beds, this peculiar pul&s;e was very di&s;tingui&s;hable; as much &s;o, I think, as in any other per&s;ons who&s;e pul&s;e I examined.</P>
<P>Hemorrhages, from various parts of the body, were frequent, e&s;pecially in the advanced &s;tage of the di&s;ea&s;e, and where it had been violent from the fir&s;t. The&s;e were from the no&s;e, fauces, e&s;pecially the gums, from punctures made in bloodletting, and from the &s;tomach: I &s;aw no other. Bleeding from the no&s;e and fauces often occurred in the beginning of the di&s;ea&s;e, and was removable by the general reme|dies. Bleedings from the punctures made in blood|letting, were &s;een in the clo&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e, and were re&s;trained with the greate&s;t difficulty. I recollect to have been con&s;tantly engaged in an attempt to re|&s;train &s;uch a hemorrhage, in company with another phy&s;ician, two of the mo&s;t melancholy hours I ever
<PB N="117" REF="031593_0130_0FED51C2949AA0B0">
experienced. Hemorrhagy from the &s;tomach I &s;hall mention more particularly hereafter.</P>
<P N="2">II. Symptoms of pulmonic affection were not un|common; though I do not recollect to have ob&s;erved them till the la&s;t of September, or beginning of Oc|tober. They &s;ometimes ro&s;e nearly to the height of pneumonia.</P>
<P>Hiccough was a trouble&s;ome &s;ymptom, and often accompanied vomiting; and there was &s;ometimes, as it appeared to me, a mingled hiccoughing and belch|ing.</P>
<P N="3">III. The marks of conge&s;tion in the brain were too numerous and unequivocal to be mi&s;taken.&mdash;A vio|lent pain in the head was one of the earlie&s;t, mo&s;t con&s;tant, and mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;&s;ing, &s;ymptoms of this di&s;|ea&s;e&mdash;Coma was a very frequent &s;ymptom; and, as I thought, in proportion to the &s;everity of the di&s;or|der. Towards the clo&s;e, it amounted almo&s;t to total &s;tupefaction; it being &s;carcely po&s;&s;ible to rou&s;e the patient. Some degree of delirium was common; par|ticularly at the commencement of an exacerbation of the Fever; manife&s;ting it&s;elf in the hurried manner in which the patient performed any action, and in the rambling manner in which he conver&s;ed. That kind of delirium which &s;ome have called <HI>light-headedne&s;s,</HI> was remarkably pre&s;ent, in one per&s;on, at the clo&s;e of his di&s;order. He often &s;tarted up, wildly, without any apparent object, then lay down, and commenced &s;inging, in an interrupted, incoherent manner; but without any violence. And the day before his death, he continued to &s;ing, with &s;light intervals, more than an hour.&mdash;At other times, he would fix on &s;ome par|ticular words, and repeat them over and over; &s;ome|times, with no appearance of emotion; at others,
<PB N="118" REF="031593_0131_0FED51C78204AD88">
with &s;ome glimmering of con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s.&mdash;In another per&s;on, a patient of a phy&s;ician of my acquaintance, the affection of the brain was like that in Phrenitis. A bli&s;tering-pla&s;ter applied, if I remember accurately, for 24 hours, to the head, which had been &s;haven, excited no ve&s;&s;ication, and &s;carcely any redne&s;s, though twice the u&s;ual quantity of cantharides was incorporated, and the patient was of a delicate ha|bit. In this ca&s;e the affection of the brain took place on the third day, and the patient died on the fifth or &s;ixth.&mdash;On examination and di&s;&s;ection of the contents of the cranium, all the membranes, and the very &s;ub|&s;tance of the brain, were di&s;covered to be in a remark|able and uncommon &s;tate of inflammation.&mdash;I have been the more particular in relating this ca&s;e, as it &s;eems to contradict, in a degree, the ideas of Dr. Ru&s;h, p. 50, of his Hi&s;tory of the Philadelphia Fever: our &s;ea&s;on having been unu&s;ually <HI>wet.</HI></P>
<P>As connected with the &s;tate of the brain, it may be proper to mention here, that the <HI>eyes</HI> were often &s;uf|fu&s;ed, the whites of them tinged with yellow, and the &s;mall ve&s;&s;els turgid with blood. In &s;ome patients they had an expre&s;&s;ion of &s;ingular wildne&s;s; while, in others, there was a remarkable vacuity, or ab&s;ence of expre&s;&s;ion.&mdash;I &s;aw no in&s;tance of &s;quinting; nor ob|&s;erved any uncommon &s;tate of the pupil: but I ought to acknowledge that my attention was not particularly directed to the condition of the eyes, in this re&s;pect.</P>
<P>The &s;tate of the mind was very variable. Some were exceedingly impatient and ira&s;cible; others, a&s;toni&s;hingly ob&s;tinate; and this particularly, when, as was often the ca&s;e, there was a lo&s;s of memory, or &s;ome degree of mania. A &s;trong appeal to their good-&s;en&s;e, calling them by name, &s;eemed to effect a tem|porary re&s;toration of their docility and recollection,&mdash;
<PB N="118" REF="031593_0132_0FED51CA57089F28">
which were &s;oon lo&s;t.&mdash;Many were very confident, at fir&s;t, &s;uppo&s;ing their illne&s;s not be the Fever; but gave them&s;elves up to de&s;pair, immediately on being convinced that it was the Fever. Many were full of dreadful apprehen&s;ions, from the fir&s;t; and often|times, exceedingly aggravated what would have been, otherwi&s;e, a &s;light di&s;ea&s;e. A few, were calm, col|lected, undaunted, throughout their &s;ickne&s;s. And here it may not be un&s;ea&s;onable to remark, that the&s;e &s;ame varieties were, in a degree, ob&s;ervable in tho&s;e who continued well. Some phy&s;icians thought they could di&s;cern a tendency, among the citizens, gene|rally, to mania. It is certain that fear was a terrible evil, and frequently proved the exciting cau&s;e of the Fever.</P>
<P N="4">IV. I have remarked that a great anxiety at the <HI>&s;to|mach</HI> was &s;ometimes felt, on the patient's being fir&s;t &s;eiz|ed with the Fever. This anxiety, it may now be added, in &s;ome ca&s;es, extended through the complaint; but was mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;&s;ing when the Fever was mo&s;t violent. A great &s;en&s;e of &s;orene&s;s was often complained of, when any thing was taken into the &s;tomach, <HI>as if it were raw;</HI>&mdash;to u&s;e the words of one in whom it was ob|&s;erved. In &s;ome, the &s;en&s;ibility of this organ was &s;o exce&s;&s;ive as to make it almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to admini&s;ter, either food or medicine, by the mouth.</P>
<P>Patients were often afflicted with extreme pain in the bowels; but more re&s;embling that in dy&s;entery, than in cholic. A di&s;charge, generally, afforded a pre&s;ent relief.</P>
<P>Flatulency, both of the &s;tomach and bowels, was almo&s;t univer&s;al, and to an extraordinary degree.&mdash; The abdomen was &s;ometimes di&s;tended with wind;
<PB N="119" REF="031593_0133_0FED51CC0C2DE3B0">
but the di&s;ten&s;ion &s;ub&s;ided after a conderable di&s;|charge of wind, downwards. This was often the ca&s;e in one of my patients.</P>
<P>Several di&s;&s;ections, as I am informed by the gen|tleman principally concerned in them, &s;hew the &s;to|mach to have been in a remarkable &s;tate of inflamma|tion and excoriation. It appears to me that this di&s;|ea&s;e of the &s;tomach, or inflammation&mdash;(if it be pro|per to call it &s;o) extended through the whole length of the Alimentary Canal; as it is known to do in Apthae and &s;ome other di&s;orders; for one ca&s;e of excoriation and partial mortification of the Rectum came within my knowlege, and I have heard of &s;everal others.</P>
<P>I have mentioned, above, that Co&s;tivene&s;s was al|mo&s;t univer&s;al at the commencement of the Fever; but it was not always pre&s;ent. For though it was ob&s;ervable in the greater number of patients, &s;o much &s;o as to de&s;erve to be ranked among the cha|racteri&s;tic &s;igns of the di&s;ea&s;e; and though a con&s;tant tendency to a co&s;tive &s;tate, was general in tho&s;e &s;ick with the di&s;order; yet, in &s;ome, the Fever was at|tended from the fir&s;t, or for a while, by a Diarrhea; and in one in&s;tance, the whole of the Di&s;ea&s;e ap|peared to me to be turned upon the bowels, and to be converted into, or a&s;&s;ume the form of a Diar|rhea.</P>
<P>Some were &s;eized with vomiting at the fir&s;t, which was &s;oon &s;topped, or cea&s;ed &s;pontaneou&s;ly, and ne|ver returned. One ca&s;e of this kind, proved favora|ble&mdash;the patient recovering; another unfavorable, the patient dying.&mdash;In others, vomiting commenced the di&s;ea&s;e, and continued through it: while in others, again, it came on in the cour&s;e, or at the
<PB N="120" REF="031593_0134_0FED51CED34ED730">
clo&s;e of the di&s;order; and this both in &s;ucce&s;sful and un&s;ucce&s;sful ca&s;es.</P>
<P N="5">V. The matters vomited up varied in colour and con&s;i&s;tence, in different per&s;ons, and in different pe|riods of the di&s;ea&s;e. The mo&s;t common was of a yellowi&s;h, greeni&s;h, or a muddy green and yellow, appearance, and very fluid. Vomitings of this kind, were &s;een both in tho&s;e who recovered, and who died; and were both temporary and continued.&mdash; Next, in frequency, was that of a blacki&s;h appearance, commonly de&s;cribed as re&s;embling coffee-grounds, but bearing a nearer re&s;emblance to blood partly burnt, and diluted with muddy water. Several who had this vomiting recovered.&mdash;I never &s;aw an in&s;tance of that tar-like vomit, which has been noticed by &s;ome writers. But, of all others, that which &s;truck me as evidential of the greate&s;t derangement of the &s;tomach, was the vomiting up of, what appeared to be, thin blood, in which floated a flaky, filmy &s;ub|&s;tance, which I &s;uppo&s;e to have been the villous coat of the &s;tomach.&mdash;This I &s;aw but in a &s;ingle in&s;tance, a few hours before death. This di&s;charge was fre|quent, though &s;mall; and accompanied by a large worm.</P>
<P>I cannot help thinking that the matters vomited up, except it be tho&s;e of the yellowi&s;h or greeni&s;h ca&s;t, have all a portion of blood mingled with them; and that their various appearances depend&mdash;a&s;ide from their mixture with the contents of the &s;to|mach&mdash;in great mea&s;ure, on the quantity of blood mingled with them. It appears to me that, in this di&s;ea&s;e, the &s;ecretion of the Bile is greatly affected; and that, in many in&s;tances, the blood it&s;elf pa&s;&s;es into the biliary ve&s;&s;els, charged with the Bile, de|&s;igned to have been &s;eparated, and being poured in|to
<PB N="121" REF="031593_0135_0FED51D0CB9A0438">
the duodenum, and di&s;charged by &s;tool or vomit|ing, communicates the blackne&s;s ob&s;erved in tho&s;e evacuations. Be&s;ide this, as appears from di&s;&s;ection, and from the ca&s;e ju&s;t mentioned, the coats of the &s;tomach it&s;elf are de&s;troyed; and the numerous little ve&s;&s;els, which, in a healthy &s;tate, di&s;till into it a limpid and colourle&s;s fluid, now are preternaturally di&s;tended, receive the blood, in&s;tead of lymph, and pour it, by their numerous orifices, into this organ. This effu&s;ion of blood may be &s;uppo&s;ed to increa&s;e, as the di&s;ea&s;e increa&s;es in violence, till, at length, the tender coats of the &s;tomach are &s;eparated, and thrown up, mingled with pure blood.&mdash;If the&s;e ideas be ju&s;t, it is clear that no vomiting can be more evidential of a fatal termination of the di&s;ea&s;e, than this; none can afford a more unequivocal &s;ign to the phy&s;ician, that his attention is no longer u&s;eful<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>If the ideas contained in the above paragraph are accurate, they will tend to confirm both the general notions of the di&s;ea&s;e, and of the proper mode of cure, advanced in the&s;e letters.

<P>The di&s;charges from the bowels were very dark, in general, even where no preparation of mercury was u&s;ed. They were, likewi&s;e, in mo&s;t ca&s;es, re|markably fluid, where the bowels had been once.
<GAP DESC="missing">
<PB N="122" REF="031593_0136_0FED51D68B4F89D0">
thoroughly, opened; and, where the purgatives were bri&s;k, and in all &s;evere ca&s;es, exce&s;&s;ively offen&s;ive.&mdash; They were, &s;ometimes, of a dark, &s;hining appearance, &s;omewhat like mola&s;&s;es, melted pitch, or black-lead. But I have &s;een &s;tools of this colour, in other di&s;|ea&s;es&mdash;particularly once in the Croup&mdash;where calo|mel was frequently u&s;ed as a purge.&mdash;I mention this, as it may &s;ometimes happen, that phy&s;icians deceive them&s;elves, in &s;uch ca&s;es, a&s;cribing that to the di&s;or|der, which depends on medicines.</P>
<P>Some were troubled, with a retention of urine: but, more generally, with an unu&s;ual flow; and this in one in&s;tance, I di&s;tinctly recollect, where the quan|tity of fluids taken into the body, was very &s;mall.</P>
<P>In re&s;pect to &s;weating, I di&s;covered nothing uni|form. In one ca&s;e, the patient always had a profu&s;e, clammy, &s;weat, when he fell into a re&s;tle&s;s &s;leep, with a ri&s;e of fever. This was often ob&s;ervable, likewi&s;e, in that &s;tate of remarkable anxiety which frequently preceded an evacuation by &s;tool.</P>
<P>Blood drawn in this Fever, was remarkably want|ing in floridity; and this was e&s;pecially true of that which was evacuated in the clo&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e&mdash; whether by art, or &s;pontaneous effu&s;ion. In one in|&s;tance it &s;eemed endowed with a cau&s;tic quality, and affected a lancet &s;o as to leave a permanent inequality and di&s;colouration of its &s;urface.</P>
<P N="6">VI. Sleep, for the mo&s;t part, appeared unnatural and unrefre&s;hing; attended by great re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s; and &s;ometimes by great mobility of the mu&s;cles, twitch|ing of the tendons, and frequent &s;tarting up. One of my patients often rai&s;ed him&s;elf up, &s;uddenly, out of bed, with every appearance of extraordinary ter|ror;
<PB N="123" REF="031593_0137_0FED51D994D40030">
but with no evident or clear con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of the act. In one per&s;on, I &s;aw remarkable <HI>&s;ub&s;ultus tendi|num.</HI></P>
<P>There was great variety in mu&s;cular power, in dif|ferent per&s;ons. A man who died with the very wor&s;t &s;ymptoms of the Fever, the evening before his death, ro&s;e from his bed, ran down two flights of &s;tairs, re|turned, and was only prevented from going down a &s;econd time by his nur&s;e's having locked him in his chamber.&mdash;In another ca&s;e, where the di&s;ea&s;e was mild, the patient felt perfectly ea&s;y and compo&s;ed, and in full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of mental and corporeal &s;trength, while he lay on his bed; but, when he ro&s;e, and at|tempted to walk, a &s;en&s;e of univer&s;al anxiety was felt, his ideas became confu&s;ed, his &s;trength &s;eemed to de|&s;ert him, a &s;udden faintne&s;s came over him, and twice he &s;unk down, unable to proceed.</P>
<P>An evacuation, by &s;tool, often &s;uddenly re&s;tored the patient, who was lifted from bed, to &s;uch a degree of &s;trength, that he continued for &s;ome time after, to walk about the room, or &s;it up.</P>
<P N="7">VII. I noticed no uncommon &s;en&s;ibility to light but in a &s;ingle ca&s;e; and that was not of long dura|tion.</P>
<P>Hearing, in one in&s;tance, I ob&s;erved to be unu&s;ually acute; but generally, it was much impaired; and, &s;ometimes, &s;eemed to be entirely lo&s;t. Perhaps this may account for the apparent lo&s;s of memory in &s;ome per&s;ons.</P>
<P>The ta&s;te was either exceedingly impaired, or very fickle. The &s;ame may be &s;aid of the appetite. When the appetite began to return, and food to be reli&s;hed,
<PB N="124" REF="031593_0138_0FED51DB4BE9F510">
the &s;ick were very voracious, but not ea&s;ily &s;uited. They di&s;covered no partiality for animal food. Thir&s;t was moderate, in a few in&s;tances; but oftener exce&s;|&s;ive. I have &s;een Porter de&s;ired; but it was not often reli&s;hed, when allowed. The &s;ame is true of coffee. Water was, univer&s;ally, the mo&s;t agreeable drink; and I allowed its free u&s;e. One of my patients fre|quently drank, in one night, when very feveri&s;h and re&s;tle&s;s, three quarts of water. The appearance of the <HI>tongue</HI> varied, according to the violence and du|ration of the di&s;ea&s;e, from white, to yellow, darki&s;h, and black, like burnt blood; and the gums often a&s;|&s;umed this la&s;t appearance, when there had been bleeding from them.</P>
<P>An a&s;toni&s;hing in&s;en&s;ibility to cold was nearly univer&s;al.&mdash;I remember, in one of tho&s;e cold turns which we had in September, a remarkable in&s;tance of this. One of my patients occupied a chamber in the &s;econd &s;tory: the room was very large, extending the whole width of the hou&s;e, and having a chimney, a large door, and two windows at either end. The bed was hard, in the middle of the room, the door and all the windows open, and he covered with a &s;ingle &s;heet, frequently thrown off in his re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s, yet he complained of no cold, while I was chilled through, though &s;heltered from the draught of air, with my u&s;ual cloaths on, and the addition of a &s;ur|tout and double cloak.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. Yellowne&s;s of the &s;kin was not con&s;tantly pre&s;ent in this di&s;ea&s;e; at lea&s;t, not in any remarkable degree. A tinge of it was common in the eyes and on the &s;kin; but not &s;tronger, in numerous in&s;tances, than in ordinary Fevers. Some were exceedingly yellow, even to being tawny&mdash;&s;o that the bed and body linen were &s;tained, both by the &s;weat and urine.</P>
<P><PB N="125" REF="031593_0139_0FED51DE64216B90">I &s;aw eruptions but in a &s;ingle in&s;tance. They re|&s;embled mu&s;keto bites &s;o nearly, that, had I not been forewarned of this &s;imilarity by Dr. Ru&s;h, in his ac|count of the Philadelphia Fever, I &s;hould have mi&s;ta|ken them, e&s;pecially con&s;idering the numbers of the&s;e <HI>animals.</HI>&mdash;In this in&s;tance, the eruptions were on every part of the body; which had not been expo&s;ed to <HI>their</HI> ravages.</P>
<P>I have &s;ometimes ob&s;erved a coldne&s;s of the &s;kin, on the body, generally, but e&s;pecially of the feet, of which the patient was uncon&s;cious, while the face and brea&s;t were red and communicated a burning &s;en&s;ation to the touch.</P>
<P N="9">IX. I have, hitherto, &s;aid nothing of the <HI>type</HI> of the Fever of 1795; and, in truth, it is a point on which I could wi&s;h to be &s;ilent, as, of all others, con|nected with the Fever, it is the one where my ob&s;erva|tion is the lea&s;t &s;atisfactory. In its milde&s;t form, the Fe|ver or pyrexia, appeared to me to be moderate and con&s;tant; without any evident or &s;trongly-marked exacerbation: when &s;evere, it fell in with Dr. Cul|len's idea of a Continued Fever, as &s;tated in his <HI>Fir&s;t Lines</HI> &sect; 27, more than with any other: but, in both ca&s;es, I could not determine that there was any regu|larity in the ri&s;e, or diminution of pyrexia; on the contrary, the remi&s;&s;ion (if it be proper to term it &s;o) was more or le&s;s protracted, and the exacerbation &s;ooner or later, moderate or &s;evere, in proportion as the patient pre&s;erved a regular &s;tate of body and mind, or was irregular in the&s;e re&s;pects. For exam|ple&mdash;any &s;udden agitation of mind, as anger, pertur|bation, &amp;c. and any irregularity of body, &s;uch as eat|ing improper food or too much food, drinking any &s;timulating drink, re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s, too long detention of the faeces, &amp;c. appeared to hurry on a return of all

the violent &s;ymptoms; while, on the other hand, the &s;ick never failed to get through the day with more ea&s;e to them&s;elves, when no &s;uch exce&s;s, or irregula|rity, happened.</P>
<P>In one ca&s;e which came under my care, and which various cau&s;es contributed to render the mo&s;t inte|re&s;ting of any I attended, there were complete inter|mi&s;&s;ions, during a part of the di&s;order; but there was no kind of regularity, either in their commencement, or duration; and a &s;light exce&s;s, in any of the parti|culars mentioned in the preceeding paragraph, was &s;ufficient to bring on a &s;peedy and violent turn of Fever.</P>
<P N="10">X. The period of convale&s;cence, as well as of Fe|ver, was variable. In the former part of the time, and before the weather began to grow cool, patients &s;el|dom died after the tenth day&mdash;as far as I can learn; but their deaths took place on the 3d, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, rarely on the 8th, and &s;till more rarely on the 9th day. After the cold weather appeared, they &s;ometimes dropped off &s;uddenly, and after having ex|hibited all the marks of convale&s;cence, three weeks from the time of their &s;eizure.&mdash;So, of tho&s;e who re|covered, &s;ome regained their health with an ela&s;tic quickne&s;s; while others, were very &s;low in the ac|qui&s;ition of &s;trength; were a long time troubled with great weakne&s;s in &s;ome of their joints, and oftene&s;t the knees; and were afflicted by oedematous &s;wellings of the feet, ancles, and legs.</P>

<P>I cannot learn that any febrile di&s;ea&s;e was ob&s;erv|ed in the city, while the Yellow-Fever was pre&s;ent. I &s;aw only one in&s;tance of Intermitting-Fever in a lady, who contracted it in the country. It was &s;light, and was &s;oon cured on her coming to town, by the u&s;ual remedies.

<P>IT was obvious, to the &s;lighte&s;t ob&s;ervation, that the mildne&s;s, or &s;everity, of the Fever of 1795, de|pended, in no &s;mall degree, on the &s;ituation of the
<PB N="129" REF="031593_0142_0FED51E919E0EC78">
patient. That tho&s;e who lived in the higher, drier, cleaner, and more airy parts of the town, were more lightly affected; and that a removal, from the other quarters, into &s;uch as were &s;o circum&s;tanced, was al|ways followed by beneficial effects to the per&s;on re|moved. In con&s;equence, a milder treatment, in every re&s;pect, e&s;pecially a more &s;paring u&s;e of evacuations, was warrantable in &s;ome ca&s;es, than in others; and as &s;ome practitioners were chiefly employed among tho&s;e who&s;e favorable &s;ituations protected them from the mo&s;t malignant attacks of the di&s;ea&s;e, you will readily conceive why there &s;hould prevail, in the minds of &s;ome, an opinion that very active remedies were unnece&s;&s;ary, and a recurrence to the lancet in|expedient, at lea&s;t, if not pernicious. It is true that I did not always u&s;e it my&s;elf; but it is al&s;o true, that I never failed to regret the omi&s;&s;ion. And though I lo&s;t no patient by the neglect, yet I am convinced that, in every &s;uch ca&s;e, however &s;light the di&s;ea&s;e might appear, the cure was protracted. But, if the remedies were not always the &s;ame, the principle on which they were admini&s;tered, was uniform; and their operation the &s;ame in kind, if not in degree.&mdash; And, after the Fever became more general, and the &s;ea&s;on con&s;iderably advanced, there was but little choice left in the u&s;e of means. Po&s;itive and &s;peedy relief was required; for to temporize, was to kill.&mdash; You will &s;ufficiently comprehend, from the&s;e re|marks, how far the practice recommended below admitted of variety in the application; and I &s;hall de|tain you no longer from the con&s;ideration of the par|ticular remedies, which are meant to be arranged nearly in the order of their comparative importance.</P>
<P N="1">I. BLOOD-LETTING.&mdash;This was indicated by the &s;evere pain, heat, and redne&s;s, of the head and countenance; by the redne&s;s, turge&s;cence,

and heavine&s;s, of the eyes; by the oppre&s;&s;ion, pain, and anxiety, often ob&s;ervable at the brea&s;t; by the fullne&s;s, hardne&s;s, ten&s;ity, or oppre&s;&s;edne&s;s of the pul&s;e&mdash;and equally by that &s;lender, wiry, vermicular feeling which it &s;ometimes had&mdash;commu|nicating an idea of approaching numbne&s;s to the finger which felt it.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is &s;carcely po&s;&s;ible to convey an idea, by words, of minute peculiarities in the pul&s;e. You will recollect this, and pardon me, if I have failed in this in&s;tance.</NOTE></P>
<P>The effects of bleeding were, in every in&s;tance where I had an opportunity of ob&s;erving them, mo&s;t &s;alutary. The &s;ick &s;eldom failed of finding immedi|ate relief from it, and of perceiving that relief in|crea&s;ed as the blood continued to flow. It dimini&s;hed the pains in the head, brea&s;t, and &s;tomach: oppre&s;|&s;ion, anxiety, faintne&s;s, and heat, were moderated: the eyes rarely failed to a&s;&s;ume a clearer and more natural appearance: and it &s;eemed to communicate a new energy to the &s;y&s;tem.&mdash;I remember an in&s;tance where a patient was &s;o unable to a&s;&s;i&s;t him&s;elf, on the &s;econd day of the di&s;ea&s;e, that, when I wanted to bleed him, it required two per&s;ons to &s;upport him, in pa&s;&s;ing a few &s;teps from his bed, into the open air.&mdash; There, he was &s;eated and &s;upported in a chair. He grew ea&s;ier, in every re&s;pect, as the blood flowed.&mdash; After taking away about twenty ounces, and tying up his arm, he ro&s;e without a&s;&s;i&s;tance; walked &s;eve|ral rods, to a Nece&s;&s;ary; took care of him&s;elf; had a profu&s;e evacuation, by which he &s;eemed to gain addi|tional &s;trength; and returned to his bed, without any aid, and with a firm &s;tep.</P>
<P>Such were the immediate effects of bleeding early in the di&s;ea&s;e. The importance of this remedy was not dimini&s;hed by the duration of the di&s;order, nor
<PB N="131" REF="031593_0144_0FED51ED83BDA440">
the nece&s;&s;ity for it le&s;&s;ened, while the &s;ymptoms con|tinued which made it u&s;eful in the commencement.&mdash; On the contrary, it was oftentimes as requi&s;ite, and as beneficial, the fifth and the &s;ixth days, as on the fir&s;t. But this nece&s;&s;ity for its u&s;e, at &s;o late a period, did not often occur, where it had been vigorou&s;ly em|ployed, in connection with other remedies, at the fir&s;t.</P>
<P>The following ca&s;e, which I &s;tate briefly, is one among numbers, in evidence of the advantage of early, free, and repeated bleeding.</P>
<P>A phy&s;ician was called to a young man, with all the &s;ymptoms of the di&s;ea&s;e&mdash;as it generally appeared at the fir&s;t&mdash;in the evening. He bled him 16 or 18 ounces; directed purges, &amp;c. in the manner hereaf|ter to be mentioned; and though the weather was then cool, ordered the windows to be removed, both day and night. The &s;ymptoms were relieved; but the next morning it was thought nece&s;&s;ary to repeat the bleeding; which was done, to an equal quantity. The purges, &amp;c. were al&s;o continued. In the even|ing, a third bleeding was performed, and a like quan|tity of blood was taken away; and the other reme|dies were continued. On the ninth day, from the &s;eizure, the man was well, and able to pur&s;ue his bu|&s;ine&s;s; though his &s;trength was not perfectly re&s;|tored.</P>
<P>In one in&s;tance which came to my knowledge, bleeding removed an ob&s;tinate vomiting, of many days continuance, which threatened the life of the pa|tient, and which had re&s;i&s;ted all other remedies.</P>
<P>It &s;eems hardly nece&s;&s;ary to add any thing more, in favor of this remedy, after its beneficial effects have
<PB N="132" REF="031593_0145_0FED51F20D258250">
been &s;tated, with &s;o much eloquence and per&s;picuity, by Dr. Ru&s;h, in his various publications, re&s;pecting the Yellow Fever.</P>
<P N="2">II. PURGING. No ca&s;e occurred, in my particular practice, where, notwith&s;tanding the vomiting, ca|thartics could not be admini&s;tered. When this &s;ymp|tom was very trouble&s;ome, they were required to be given in a &s;olid form, at more considerable intervals, and of as &s;mall a &s;ize as po&s;&s;ible. The activity of the purge was always to be proportioned to the vio|lence of the &s;ymptoms; and it was important that all medicines of this kind &s;hould be given in divided do&s;es&mdash;&s;o as to promote a gradual and continued di&s;|charge.&mdash;The operation was often very much a&s;&s;i&s;ted by cly&s;ters; for which water alone was nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>The good effects of cathartics were not le&s;s obvi|ous than tho&s;e of venae&s;ection. They were indicated by the con&s;tipation, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> generally pre&s;ent; by pain in the bowels, flatulency, and tumefaction of the abdo|men; by pains of the head, heat and flu&s;hings of the face, and of the whole body; and finally, by the vo|mitings: and all the&s;e &s;ymptoms they rarely failed to obviate, or relieve. This relief, too, was oftentimes &s;o &s;udden, as to &s;eem like enchantment.&mdash;Frequently have I &s;een a patient, after an hour or more of &s;evere pain, re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s, heat, thir&s;t, and inquietude of every kind&mdash;feeble, exhau&s;ted, and as it were, ready to ex|pire&mdash;ri&s;e with the greate&s;t difficulty, and with the aid of others, to the chair, and after his evacuation, feel his pains removed, his heat and re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s va|ni&s;hed, his &s;trength renewed, and him&s;elf able to fit up, or walk about, and breathe the air with freedom: and &s;ometimes, the di&s;charge was followed by a re|fre&s;hing &s;leep, and gentle per&s;piration.</P>
<P><PB N="133" REF="031593_0146_0FED51F4EE0B3758">The&s;e benefits were neither &s;o certainly, nor &s;o fre|quently, obtained, where the evacuations were violent and &s;udden. Indeed, it appears que&s;tionable to me, whether it be ever proper to excite &s;uch discharges, in Fevers. Patients, when much reduced, are apt to &s;ink under &s;uch immediate and abundant evacua|tions.</P>
<P N="3">III. COOL AIR.&mdash;It was of the utmo&s;t importance to procure a con&s;tant application of cool air to the body of the patient, from the commencement of the Fever. The advantages which re&s;ulted, were univer|&s;al and wonderful.&mdash;To this end, the &s;ick were or|dered to be placed on a hard bed, with very little covering, in the middle of the room; and the doors and windows were, as much as po&s;&s;ible, kept open day and night.&mdash;The good effects of this practice were exceedingly increa&s;ed, where the application of the cool air could be made to the patient in an erect po&s;ture. For, not only was it more equable, but the head was al&s;o relieved, thereby, from that &s;en&s;e of fullne&s;s and oppre&s;&s;ion which was invariably experi|enced in a recumbent po&s;ture. The &s;ick, therefore, were directed to &s;it up, in the cour&s;e of the day, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of their attendants, as long as their &s;trength would permit, without their becoming ex|hau&s;ted. While in this &s;ituation, their feet and legs were covered more warmly than any other part of the body: and if cloths, dipped in cold water, or vinegar, were often applied to the temples, the relief obtained was &s;till greater.</P>
<P N="4">IV. COOL DRINKS.&mdash;The great thir&s;t, which was nearly univer&s;al in this Fever, from the fir&s;t, made the drinks, of nece&s;&s;ity, an article of early attention. It was ob&s;ervable that they never could be <HI>too cold.</HI> Pa|tients
<PB N="134" REF="031593_0147_0FED51F6AC28E6B0">
complained of the warmth of water which had been &s;tanding but a &s;hort time; and &s;eemed to langui&s;h for a &s;upply of fre&s;h water, with an anxiety which became truly painful, when the u&s;ual hour of its di&s;tribution approached.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The water which is u&s;ed for drinking, in this city, is mo&s;tly drawn from a &s;ingle pump, called the Tea-Water Pump; and it is di&s;tributed, by means of large ca&s;ks, which are carted to every part of the town; once a day, in winter; and every morning and afternoon, in &s;ummer.</NOTE></P>
<P>The good effects of a plentiful u&s;e of cool, dilut|ing drinks, were obvious. They tempered the pre|ternatural heat and anxiety of the &s;tomach; often re|&s;trained vomiting, and the faucial hemorrhage; &s;erv|ed to dilute, and carry off, the offen&s;ive contents of the inte&s;tines; and di&s;po&s;ed to a more equable and aqueous &s;weat.&mdash;Of all other drinks, Water was mo&s;t reli&s;hed&mdash;and on many accounts, was the mo&s;t pro|per. A plea&s;ant and &s;uitable drink was made, by pouring warm water on fre&s;h apples, and &s;uffering it to cool; and likewi&s;e, by the addition of a piece of toa&s;ted bread to water. Milk, much diluted with water, was reli&s;hed by &s;ome; &s;ome were fond of but|ter-milk; and as all the&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed bland and nutriti|ous, qualities, they were advantageou&s;ly u&s;ed, where a variety of drinks was required by the capricious ta&s;te of the patient.</P>
<P>I had no opportunity of trying the effiacy of ICE, but the te&s;timony of a Phy&s;ician, in whole judgement and veracity I place great confidence, is &s;trongly in its favor, and inclines me to believe that it may be u&s;ed with high expectations of advantage. Under his direction, it an&s;wered, better than any thing el&s;e, in relieving heat and fever; re&s;training hemorrhagy;
<PB N="135" REF="031593_0148_0FED51F9F6FE2000">
and obviating, partially, or entirely, the vomiting&mdash; even the <HI>black vomiting.</HI></P>
<P N="5">V. CLEANLINESS.&mdash;This is of the utmo&s;t impor|tance, and, in a mea&s;ure, indi&s;pen&s;able.&mdash;The bed and body linen &s;hould be often changed; the cloaths nece&s;&s;ary about the bed, well aired, &s;everal times a day: there &s;hould be two beds, one of which may be aired, while the other is in u&s;e: all unne|ce&s;&s;ary furniture&mdash;particularly woollen, &s;ilk and cot|ton&mdash;every thing which may ab&s;orb and retain efflu|via and moi&s;ture&mdash;&s;hould be removed: all uten&s;ils employed about the patient, frequently changed and rin&s;ed: the room &s;hould be often &s;prinkled and du&s;ted: the face, mouth, eyes whole head, hands&mdash; and, where it can be done, body of the patient, wa&s;hed with <HI>cool</HI> water, &s;everal times in the day. The more exactly&mdash;other circum&s;tances being regarded&mdash;the&s;e directions can be put in execution, the better for the patient; and, as my own experience convinces me, the more certain and &s;peedy will be his recovery.&mdash; You will ob&s;erve that I &s;ay cool water; for I cannot believe that the &s;hock which would follow from the application of cold water to the body, would be be|neficial.&mdash;It is not here, as in the u&s;e of air; for water is &s;o much more perfect a conductor of heat, that the ab&s;traction would be univer&s;al and &s;udden, were it applied cold. And, be&s;ide, as much is effected per|haps, by the ablution, as by the coldne&s;s, con&s;equent upon bathing.</P>
<P>It was not in my power, in any ca&s;e, to carry this practice to the extent I wi&s;hed; but, <HI>caeteris paribus,</HI> the relief of the patient was proportioned to the de|gree in which it was pur&s;ued.</P>
<P N="6"><PB N="136" REF="031593_0149_0FED51FD9E350C28">VI. BLISTERS.&mdash;The advantages u&s;ually derived from the u&s;e of bli&s;ters, were not evident. It was &s;ometimes doubtful whether they were any way &s;erviceable. Yet there were instances in which they afforded relief; though mo&s;tly temporarily.&mdash; I have &s;een them, applied to the brea&s;t, relieve the oppre&s;&s;ion at the lungs; and applied to the back of the neck, relieve the head: in both ca&s;es, when the di&s;ea&s;e had been of &s;ome days continuance. A phy&s;ician, to whom I mentioned the&s;e remarks, in|formed me that his experience ju&s;tified them, except when, as was often ob&s;erved by him, a hemorrhage en&s;ued from the ve&s;ication, and continued for &s;ome days. Perhaps it was nece&s;&s;ary to the efficacy of bli&s;|ters, that they &s;hould have been, always, preceded by copious blood-letting.</P>
<P N="7">VII. The <HI>Tinctura Sacra,</HI> given in &s;mall quantities, at intervals, in water, was found by one Phy&s;ician, to have the happie&s;t effects, in relieving nau&s;ea, and obviating the tendency to vomit, in all ca&s;es where a de&s;truction of the coats of the &s;tomach had not taken place. The &s;ame gentleman derived much advantage over the di&s;ea&s;e, where, from long-continued vo|miting and effort to vomit, the &s;tomach appeared to have &s;u&s;tained con&s;iderable injury, or abra&s;ion, from the u&s;e of <HI>Ol. Oliv. vel amygdal. dulc.</HI>&mdash;The oil co|vered the inflamed, or abraded, part, and protected it from mechanical &s;timulus, while it allayed the &s;orene&s;s and irritation produced by the action of the di&s;ea&s;ed fluids it contained.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. FOOD.&mdash;I have before remarked that the &s;ick &s;hewed no preference for animal food; on the con|trary, they very generally refu&s;ed it. Some, who reque&s;ted it to be prepared for them, found them&s;elves
<PB N="137" REF="031593_0150_0FED5200C4368978">
unable to eat it, when pre&s;ented to them.&mdash;Fruits, milk, bi&s;cuit boiled in milk or water, &s;ago, &s;alep, ha&s;ty-pudding, and vegetable food, generally, were mo&s;t reli&s;hed by them, both during their illne&s;s and their convale&s;cence.&mdash;This was peculiarly fortunate, as any indulgence in a contrary cour&s;e, was &s;ure to be followed by di&s;tre&s;&s;ing effects. The more rigidly attentive patients were to pre&s;erving a &s;implicity of diet, the more certain and plea&s;ant was their recovery. And, in all ca&s;es that I had opportunity to ob&s;erve, their convale&s;cence was always extended or &s;hortened, tedious or &s;atisfactory, in proportion as they returned &s;uddenly to the u&s;e of meats and &s;timulating drinks, or adhered to vegetable food and water.</P>
<P>I have now, my dear friend, made you acquainted with that cour&s;e which I generally pur&s;ued, in regard to tho&s;e who came under my care. The number was not great, nor the &s;ucce&s;s always complete&mdash;for I had not always the liberty of employing the means I wi&s;hed to, as fully and freely as was nece&s;&s;ary to com|plete &s;ucce&s;s. But, I can truly &s;ay, that I never &s;aw them do injury; and that they appeared to me to do good, in every ca&s;e, where they were employed, and in the proportion of their trial and application.&mdash; More than this no man can truly declare; more than this ought never to be expected from any remedies.

<HEAD><HI>LETTER TENTH.</HI> Mi&s;cellaneous remarks on Medicines u&s;ed as Remedies in the Fever, and general conclu&s;ions.</HEAD>
<P>You wi&s;h to obtain every po&s;&s;ible information, re&s;pecting the Fever of 1795; you are not &s;atisfied with knowing what remedies I employed, nor which were mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful; but you would learn all that were u&s;ed; the &s;ucce&s;s, or failure of each. I ap|plaud your curio&s;ity, my friend, for I am not ignorant of the benevolent motives which excite it; but I fear that there is little with which it is in my power fur|ther to gratify it. The practice which I &s;aw, was that which I have recommended: other remedies I know were u&s;ed; but, not having had opportunity, but in few in&s;tances, to mark their effects, I ought not, from my own convictions, how well-founded &s;oever they may appear to me, precipitately to con|demn either the pre&s;criptions, or their authors. In the variety of ca&s;es, con&s;titutions, and circum&s;tances, it might happen that &s;ome of tho&s;e very things, which
<PB N="139" REF="031593_0152_0FED52055487A168">
appeared pernicious when I &s;aw them u&s;ed, were &s;ometimes proper and &s;alutary. It would be pre|&s;umptuous, therefore, in me, to decide without more information; but I may be allowed an opinion; and that opinion need not be with-held from a friend.&mdash;I confe&s;s, then, that from the &s;ucce&s;s which attended the antiphlogi&s;tic plan of cure, I am per&s;uaded that no other can be &s;alutary, or &s;afe; and the few in|&s;tances in which the effects of a different mode of treating the Fever were ob&s;erved by me, &s;trengthened my previous convictions of its inutility and dan|ger.</P>
<P>The medicines chiefly tru&s;ted to, by tho&s;e who pur&s;ued a different cour&s;e from that laid down in the preceding letter, were, as I am informed, Calomel, to promote, or effect a Salivation,&mdash;Bark&mdash;Lauda|num&mdash;Wine, and other &s;timulating drinks&mdash;with an Animal diet.</P>
<P>Of the effects of Salivation, not having &s;een it take place, by nature nor art, in the Fever of 1795, I can &s;ay nothing. Dr. Ru&s;h countenances the practice, in his Treati&s;e on the Fever of Philadelphia, and adds the te&s;timony of many re&s;pectable authorities to his own.&mdash;As a Cathartic, Calomel, combined with other purgative &s;ub&s;tances, was unque&s;tionably u&s;e|ful. Some, I know, thought otherwi&s;e; and that other purgatives might be more &s;afely and efficaciou&s;|ly employed; and, I confe&s;s, I &s;aw &s;ome ca&s;es in which it appeared to affect the &s;tomach very painful|ly. But a Phy&s;ician on who&s;e judgment I have great reliance, informs me, that he &s;aw rea&s;on to re|ject a &s;imilar opinion, which he had ha&s;tily adopted; repeated ob&s;ervation having convinced him, that all the &s;ymptoms of ga&s;tric affection were wor&s;e in tho&s;e
<PB N="140" REF="031593_0153_0FED520965BF8360">
who had not been purged with Calomel, than in tho&s;e who had been evacuated by its a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>I gave Bark, in no form, but in three ca&s;es. Two were in the early part of the reign of the Fever, the two fir&s;t patients that I had; and I am convinced it retarded the cure in both. In the other in&s;tance, it was admini&s;tered after the Fever had left the Patient, and he was convale&s;cent. Here it was given as any other Bitter, and as much in compliance with his opinions, as from any expectation of its doing good; and, as far as I can judge, with very little effect of any kind.&mdash;In the following ca&s;e, its exhibition was not &s;o harmle&s;s.</P>
<P>A medical friend was called to vi&s;it the patient of another Phy&s;ician, who had quitted town, on account of his health. The &s;ick man was oppre&s;t by the mo&s;t alarming &s;ymptoms; of the number of which, were hemorrhagy and the black vomit. The &s;timu|lating &s;y&s;tem had been &s;teadily pur&s;ued, and was con|tinued, under the direction of a pupil of the phy&s;ician fir&s;t employed. In particular, large quantities of Bark were exhibited, throughout the day.&mdash;On the entrance of the &s;econd phy&s;ician, the Bark and all other medicines of the kind, were laid a&s;ide; cool air was freely admitted; and the antiphlogi&s;tic plan of cure &s;trictly adhered to. The con&s;equence was, that all the &s;ymptoms were relieved, and a pro&s;pect opened on the patient of a recovery. The vomiting and hemorrhagy had totally cea&s;ed. In this &s;itua|tion, and while the Phy&s;ician was attending to &s;ome per&s;ons who&s;e condition was more alarming, the per&s;on who had the immediate charge of the &s;ick man, began, again, to admini&s;ter the Bark.&mdash;The next day &mdash;or the very &s;ame, at night&mdash;all the bad &s;ymptoms
<PB N="141" REF="031593_0154_0FED520B26072B20">
recurred; the Bark was, nevertheless, per&s;i&s;ted in; and the man died.</P>
<P>Several &s;imilar ca&s;es have been reported to me; but none &s;o minutely as to authorize an attempt to &s;tate them to you.</P>
<P>The extreme re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s of a patient, in whom I had the &s;tronge&s;t intere&s;t, and for who&s;e fate the deepe&s;t anxiety, induced me, in violation of my more &s;ober judgement, to admini&s;ter Laudanum.&mdash; This I did not do, till he had &s;pent three nearly &s;leep|le&s;s nights.&mdash;In every in&s;tance, it undoubtedly, in|creased the re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s, clammy &s;weats, thir&s;t and Fever. I was obliged to di&s;continue it.</P>
<P>Wine, brandy and water, and e&s;pecially porter, when taken by any of my patients, had the mo&s;t per|nicious effects. I had occa&s;ion to &s;ee an acce&s;s of Fever, repeatedly brought on by the one, and a re|lap&s;e by the other; where they were u&s;ed without my knowlege, and contrary to my direction.</P>
<P>Of the effects of Animal Diet, I have already &s;poken, and have nothing new to add.</P>
<P>On the whole, it appears inconte&s;tible to me, that what is called the antiphlogi&s;tic treatment is to be adopted in Fevers like that which prevailed in New-York, in 1795, in all its &s;trictne&s;s, and adhered to with pertinacious re&s;olution. Both the &s;ymptoms of the di&s;ea&s;e, and the &s;ucce&s;s attendant on the practice recommended, concur in e&s;tabli&s;hing the propriety of employing it.&mdash;It is al&s;o to be remembered that, in this di&s;ea&s;e, not a moment is to be lo&s;t: a day, an hour, nay almo&s;t an in&s;tant of delay, may &s;ometimes be fatal; and the means practi&s;ed mu&s;t be powerful in proportion to the violence of the &s;ymptoms. Nei|ther
<PB N="142" REF="031593_0155_0FED520E1DB368A8">
mu&s;t we be deceived by the apparent mildne&s;s of the &s;eizure&mdash;for a few hours may entirely change the face of things, and we may be left to lament that credulity which led us to temporize, and prevented the u&s;e of tho&s;e remedies, which delay alone rendered ineffectual.</P>
<P>But, while the Phy&s;ician &s;trenuou&s;ly directs his ef|forts to the removal of the &s;ymptoms of this di&s;ea&s;e, let him not overlook a pa&s;&s;ion which never fails to aggravate them. <HI>Fear,</HI> the exciting cau&s;e, in many in|&s;tances, of the Fever; the fomenter of all its evils; and &s;ometimes, as it were, the &s;ole di&s;ea&s;e; is a fre|quent and dreadful calamity, and one of the dire&s;t adver&s;aries with which medicine has to contend.&mdash;In numerous in&s;tances, during the continuance of the Fever of 1795, apprehen&s;ion touched upon in&s;anity; de&s;troying all confidence in the Phy&s;ician and in re|medies, or exciting an ab&s;urd and enthu&s;ia&s;tic reliance on pretenders and madmen: and utterly di&s;qualfying the patient for a proper attention to him&s;elf.&mdash;In the well, the evil was &s;carcely le&s;s. The name, alone, of Yellow Fever, &s;eemed &s;ufficient to induce di&s;ea&s;e, to bani&s;h di&s;cretion, to &s;ever the bonds of &s;ocial connec|tion, rend a&s;under the ties of parental, filial, and con|nubial affection, and put rea&s;on to flight.&mdash;It was in vain to point out the folly of this terror; to declare the di&s;ea&s;e not infectious, and ea&s;y of prevention; to offer mathematical demon&s;tration that other di&s;orders were often more mortal, without exciting any alarm; it was &s;till the Yellow Fever, and that was an irre&s;i|&s;table reply to every argument.&mdash;The city of New-Haven, &s;ummer before la&s;t, lo&s;t about 50 of its inha|bitants, with the Yellow Fever. Univer&s;al con&s;ter|nation prevailed throughout the place; all bu&s;ine&s;s was at an end; and mo&s;t of the principal inhabitants fled.&mdash;La&s;t &s;ummer, the Dy&s;entery raged there: more
<PB N="143" REF="031593_0156_0FED5212C52609F8">
than 70 per&s;ons died of it: but nobody fled; nobody was frightened; and the Magi&s;trates, very gravely, put a &s;top to all communication with New-York, for fear of the Yellow Fever; made ve&s;&s;els ride qua|rantine, and confined &s;tage-coach pa&s;&s;engers, that no contagion might be diffu&s;ed, through the city, from their trunks and their garments.&mdash;But, it is time to put an end to this &s;eries of letters; and &s;eek, by no|velty, to give new intere&s;t to our corre&s;pondence. I shall take my leave of the pre&s;ent &s;ubject, with an enumeration of the inferences I have drawn from having viewed it, in the light here exhibited to you.</P>
<P N="1">1. The Fever of 1795 was Endemic:&mdash;i. e. gene|rated by local cau&s;es, producing a Fever every year, in this city.</P>
<P N="2">2. The peculiar ferocity of the Endemic of New-York, in 1795, is a&s;cribable to the peculiarity of the &s;ea&s;on, together with a greater accumulation, than u&s;ual, of the ordinary cau&s;es.</P>
<P N="3">3. It was not Contagious: i. e. communicated by contact of di&s;ea&s;ed per&s;ons, by cloaths, nor by vi&s;iting the &s;ick, &amp;c.</P>
<P N="4">4. As it originated here, its prevention will depend on a change of the local and individual circum&s;tances which promote it.</P>
<P N="5">5. The Fever in 1795, exhibited &s;uch appearances as characterize what are cu&s;tomarily denominated In|flammatory Di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P N="6">6. It is cured by the remedies &s;uited to remove In|flammatory Di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P N="7"><PB N="144" REF="031593_0157_0FED5215B9246718">7. The &s;ame cau&s;es which converted the ordinary Fever of New-York into the Yellow Fever, would change the Fever which prevails around our We&s;|tern Lakes into the Yellow Fever; and, as certainly, the Intermitting Fever of Sheffield: while the e&s;ta|bli&s;hment of a free ventilation, the filling up of all pools, yards, &amp;c. and a &s;crupulous attention to clean|line&s;s and &s;imple diet, would reduce our Fever to a &s;imple Remittent or Intermittent, or remove it alto|gether; as the filling up and cultivation of your ponds and mar&s;hes, would forever bani&s;h all Fevers of the kind&mdash;as general di&s;ea&s;es&mdash;from Sheffield.</P>
<P>I have now, my dear friend, performed the ta&s;k demanded of me, in the be&s;t manner I am able con|&s;i&s;tent with my lei&s;ure, and my duty towards others. I cannot conclude without once more &s;oliciting your indulgence, and reque&s;ting you to recollect with what expectations and confe&s;&s;ions I entered on the compo|&s;ition of the&s;e letters.&mdash;I have taken the words of Cicero for my motto&mdash;
<Q>Rationem, qu&ograve; ea me cumque ducet &s;equar&mdash;</Q></P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IF, in our attempts to add to your information re&s;pecting the fever, which prevailed here in Augu&s;t la&s;t, we &s;hould draw upon us the illiberal &s;arca&s;ms, which we have ob&s;erved to attend all who endeavor to &s;erve their fellow creatures in this way, we mu&s;t leave it to you to ju&s;tify our intentions, at lea&s;t, be|ing our&s;elves unprepared to an&s;wer any thing which may be objected to what we &s;hall advanc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&punc; We mean to &s;tate facts, or what we believe to be &s;uch, and willing to admit that there are &s;everal ways of curing the &s;ame di&s;ea&s;e. It will not be under&s;tood, that we reprobate the practice of others who follow a different mode of treatment. Our ob&s;ervations have been drawn from thirty years experience, with the advantage of records relating to &s;imilar di&s;ea&s;es for a much longer period. We do not know of a more regular mode of treating the &s;ubject than by an&s;wering your inquiries in the order they occur, which will perhaps comprehend every thing required at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P><PB N="148" REF="031593_0160_0FED521E1DE0F4D0">The Fever we believe has its origin in the &s;ea&s;on, and exi&s;ts every year in various grades, beginning generally in the month of Augu&s;t, and disappearing about the middle of October.</P>
<P>The preci&s;e time of its commencement and termi|nation, and its degree of malignancy, depending upon contingent cau&s;es. We have been accu&s;tomed to call it a Bilious Remittent, with a tendency to putrefac|tion; whenever it proves uncommonly fatal, it is aggravated, according to the be&s;t of our ob&s;ervation, by the prevalence of &s;ome unu&s;ual weather for a long time together&mdash;Thus we have &s;een this di&s;ea&s;e equally malignant after a dry hot &s;ea&s;on, and after a very rainy period. The approach of fro&s;ty weather being uniformly the cure for the effects of either.&mdash; The Fever of the la&s;t autumnal &s;ea&s;on, appeared fir&s;t on the river, then on the &s;treets adjoining; was &s;oon after diffu&s;ed through the town and &s;uburbs, and finally the neighboring country; though in this la&s;t not generally: as u&s;ual it declined on the approach of cold weather.&mdash;The month of June had been very cool, and at the change of the moon, or a little be|fore, it began to rain in torrents, and &s;o continued to do, with &s;hort intervals of clo&s;e &s;ultry weather, till Augu&s;t, when a violent hurricane, attended with a flood of rain, laid wa&s;te the whole vegetable king|dom&mdash;afterwards the weather was as before, &s;ultry and moi&s;t, with profu&s;e &s;howers till the end of Sep|tember.&mdash;The fir&s;t appearance of the Fever was about the 10th of Augu&s;t; it increa&s;ed in violence and in exten&s;ion during all that month; it was per|ceived then to abate, and continued to do &s;o till the la&s;t day of September, when a few fro&s;ty nights &s;u|pervening, it di&s;appeared almo&s;t &s;uddenly and en|tirely.</P>
<P><PB N="149" REF="031593_0161_0FED5220CC318948">There were perhaps more deaths, than for many years before; but whether greater in number to the proportion of the &s;ick, than is u&s;ual from autumnal di&s;ea&s;es, which prove as univer&s;al as that in que&s;tion, we cannot undertake to determine. The &s;ame mode of treatment generally &s;ucceeded&mdash;as in other &s;ea|&s;ons. Our method was plentiful depletion in the be|ginning, not by bleeding, but by purging with Jalap, Calomel, Scammony, Aloes, or by the milder purges, the Neutral Salts&mdash;Sennae, Rhubarb, Manna, &amp;c. as the age, &s;ex and con&s;titution of the patient pointed out,&mdash;taking care that the evacuation of the fir&s;t pa&s;&s;ages was complete, by whatever means procured. As &s;oon as we judged that to be &s;ufficient&mdash;which we always endeavored to make &s;o with as little delay as po&s;&s;ible&mdash;the bark was admini&s;tered in all and every form that it could be made to remain, without re|gard to quantity, or to the period, or height of the fever, with wine, porter, and even brandy, if wine was rejected by the inclination, habit, or &s;tomach of the patient. We can a&s;&s;ure you, we have no rea&s;on to alter our mode of practice in future. In a multitude of in&s;tances, &s;ome will occur in all di&s;ea&s;es, when a change, and &s;ometimes a material change of reme|dies may be nece&s;&s;ary&mdash;&s;uch ca&s;es we found, and in tho&s;e we u&s;ed Bli&s;ters, Emetics, Camphor, Opium, and often ventured upon Cupping&mdash;but never upon venae&s;ection.&mdash;This la&s;t, a long cour&s;e of practice has taught us to be at lea&s;t, not advantageous. In diffe|rent climates, and under other circum&s;tances&mdash;when the di&s;ea&s;e may have appeared in other grades than tho&s;e we have experienced&mdash;that operation is perhaps found u&s;eful. We wi&s;h not to impo&s;e our opinion, as a rule for any per&s;on; &s;en&s;ible of the fallability of all human judgment. We ever thought it our duty to give up our own theories, when contradicted by events. We only mean to recommend that plan,
<PB N="150" REF="031593_0162_0FED5222830F91C0">
which long experience has taught us to be mo&s;t &s;uc|ce&s;sful. There is no proof that this di&s;ea&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed any &s;pecific infection. It was rarely fatal to the na|tive inhabitants or the old &s;ettlers, &s;peaking of the town only; but we have been told that many of the traders from the Rivers and di&s;tant part of the State, died immediately after leaving the port. The terror which pervaded all parts of the country, and deprived tho&s;e victims of the common attentions of humanity, will ea&s;ily account for this without applying to the malignancy of the di&s;ea&s;e. All, or mo&s;t of tho&s;e born in, or who had been accu&s;tomed to a &s;outhern cli|mate, e&s;caped death, and when attacked, had the di&s;|ea&s;e in its milder form.</P>
<P>A large number of the inhabitants enjoyed unin|terrupted health; mo&s;t of the deaths happened in confined &s;treets and buildings, and in tho&s;e neare&s;t the river.&mdash;Tho&s;e who were accu&s;tomed to live well, (as it is termed) did not &s;uffer &s;o much as the poorer cla&s;s&mdash;But the intemperate of every de&s;cription be|came victims when attacked&mdash;The &s;mall pox imme|diately preceded this fever. We did not ob&s;erve that tho&s;e who had been the &s;ubjects of it were par|ticularly &s;ufferers.&mdash;There had been no malignant complaint in the preceding winter.</P>
<P>A particular de&s;cription of the fever, and its &s;ymp|toms, does not &s;eem to be here nece&s;&s;ary, becau&s;e, it differed from the ordinary Bilious Remittent, only in the rapidity with which it pa&s;&s;ed through the &s;everal &s;tages, and in its malignancy.&mdash;This la&s;t circum&s;tance we are of opinion was occa&s;ioned by the long conti|nued and univer&s;al heat and moi&s;ture of the atmo&s;|phere.&mdash;The air was evidently impregnated with pu|trid effluvia, ari&s;ing from decayed &s;ub&s;tances of every &s;ort, brought down upon the creeks and rivers by the
<PB N="151" REF="031593_0163_0FED5225E6FE48D8">
floods of rain, and thence into the ba&s;on immediately before the town, where the &s;tream being wider, is le&s;s rapid than either above or below, and where of cour&s;e &s;uch decayed &s;ub&s;tances, together with the filth, &amp;c. thrown from the &s;hipping and docks, be|came for a certain time &s;tationary.&mdash;This may in &s;ome mea&s;ure account for the di&s;ea&s;e appearing fir&s;t in the harbour.&mdash;The &s;ame fever, with all its malig|nant and uncontroulable &s;ymptoms, occurs every year in &s;cattered in&s;tances, and about the &s;ea&s;on.&mdash;In the preceding &s;ummer and autumn, &s;everal died with it. A number of &s;hips and ve&s;&s;els, which occa&s;ionally put into this port from James's River, and from North-Carolina, lo&s;t many of their people with a fe|ver of this fort, which they brought with them from the fre&s;h and braki&s;h waters. In the pre&s;ent year (1795) on board a &s;hip from Liverpool, which did not approach nearer than five miles to the town, and with the crew of which the captain a&s;&s;ured us&mdash;No communication had been from the &s;hore, except by the health boat, almo&s;t every individual was attacked with the di&s;ea&s;e, in ten days after her arrival, and one of them (a European) died, and this at a period when the di&s;ea&s;e had almo&s;t di&s;appeared in the town. We have before ob&s;erved that the exhalations from the river, and the putrid &s;ub&s;tances carried down its &s;tream, might have &s;ome agency in producing or ag|gravating the Fever. The French &s;hips to which you allude<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The French corvettes, part of the &s;quadron, three of which were taken by the Thetis, Captain Cochran, arrived and anchored in Hampton Roads, May 18. The Fever did not appear in Norfolk till Augu&s;t. Capt. Cochran's crew, however, took the Fever from the French pri&s;oners, and twelve of them died before the Thetis arrived at Hallifax.&mdash;<HI>Editor.</HI></NOTE>, arrived &s;o long before the di&s;ea&s;e appear|ed, that it would be ab&s;urd to &s;uppo&s;e even a po&s;&s;i|bility
<PB N="152" REF="031593_0164_0FED522A32B1FB48">
of its being derived from them. We are of opinion, that there is not the mo&s;t di&s;tant rea&s;on to believe the Fever was imported at all.</P>
<P>How far in towns like ours, the cu&s;tomary diet and general mode of living, may operate in produc|ing putrid di&s;ea&s;es, remains for future ob&s;ervation to determine.</P>
<P>It has been noticed by &s;everal medical writers, that fre&s;h meats, and particularly beef in &s;outhern climates, apparently generate fluxes and other ma|lignant di&s;ea&s;es;&mdash;upon the latter kind of food, and on fre&s;h fi&s;h (both of them <HI>frequently not of the be&s;t quality</HI>) the poorer cla&s;s of inhabitants &s;ub&s;i&s;t during the &s;ummers. Tho&s;e who&s;e circum&s;tances permit them to purcha&s;e the be&s;t kind of meats and fi&s;h, cer|tainly experience no inconvenience from the&s;e kinds of food.</P>
<P>It has gone forth that the town of Norfolk is un|healthy and &s;ubject to malignant di&s;ea&s;es in a greater degree than others.

<HEAD>EXTRACT OF DR. RAMSAY'S (OF NORFOLK, VIRGINIA) LETTER TO MR. MITCHILL;&mdash;CONCERNING THE PES|TILENTIAL SICKNESS IN NORLFOLK, IN THE SUMMER AND AUTUMN OF 1795.</HEAD>
<P>YOUR papers afforded a te&s;timony of e&s;teem, which will be a plea&s;ant renewal of our intimacy in Europe. The little comprehen&s;ive pamphlet on con|tagion, as you required, I have read often; upon that I intend now to addre&s;s you, without entering upon a theoretical que&s;tion.&mdash;Names and terms have fettered much medical &s;cience in its progre&s;s to that degree of perfection, the pre&s;ent &s;tate of the human mind can attain to. I &s;hall &s;end, with little comment, a &s;tatement of a Fever which prevailed with great mortality here, in Augu&s;t and September 1795. Confining my&s;elf to my own ob&s;ervations and the &s;entiments of Dr. Taylor, a veteran of 25 or 30 years practice; and Hansford, his co-partner, of 14. You remember when it began.

Being foreigners, they dealt lavi&s;hly in beef, fi&s;h, and all kinds of fre&s;h food&mdash;ob&s;erve, this beef was driven perhaps from one to two hundred miles before killed, then expo&s;ed in a hot market to vend; that by one o'clock, their dining hour, I always did, and do be|lieve, it mu&s;t have been tainted&mdash;Ob&s;erve, the fi&s;h all dead by break of day, and brought by land from twenty down to twelve miles&mdash;hard drinkers of &s;pi|rits, mo&s;tly. The fir&s;t per&s;on who died, was Dr. Williams, a fat man, with very lax fibres, a very free liver, a grog drinker: he was taken with the u&s;ual &s;ymptoms of what an old writer upon the di&s;ea&s;es of the We&s;t-Indies, calls a Bilious Remittent; he vo|mited va&s;t quantities of bile; evacuated freely, as appeared to me below, but had always a prodigious &s;en&s;e of weight in the region of his &s;tomach. Belched wonderful quantities of wind; this relieved him for a time.

One or two more natural born citizens, were the whole, out of upwards of two hundred and twenty, who in the &s;pace of &s;ix weeks, fell a victim to this di&s;ea&s;e.

We need not extend our views acro&s;s the Atlantic for &s;ources of di&s;ea&s;es; there are too many among our|&s;elves as you remark, and whether the principle takes Cullen's, Ru&s;h's, or your own name, putrid animal vegetable matter, united or mixed in water, by the heat of the &s;un, produces &s;omething noxious to life.</P>
<P>The object then de&s;erves the attention of the po|lice, and when medical aid is needed, my plan is to allay the irritability of the &s;tomach; to exhibit injec|tions; to increa&s;e the action of the alimentary canal downwards, which gives me an opportunity of throwing in a cathartic to evacuate the whole tract; this I &s;ometimes repeat, if the di&s;ten&s;ion of the &s;to|mach returns. Often when the vomiting inclined me to believe there would be a difficulty in my intention of evacuating as above; I have u&s;ed with &s;ucce&s;s, co|pious draughts of luke warm water, &s;ometimes grog&mdash; the patient puked ea&s;ier, and generally more bile, and the &s;pirits acted as a moderate &s;timulus.

<HEAD>SUMMARY VIEW OF DR. MITCHILL'S OPINION CONCERNING THE CAUSES OF EPIDEMIC DISTEMPERS.</HEAD>
<P>HE begins by examining the con&s;tituent parts of the atmo&s;phere, and agrees with the modern phi|lo&s;ophers, that it con&s;i&s;ts of a little more than a fourth part of oxigene gas or re&s;pirable air, and &s;omewhat le&s;s than three-fourths of mephitic air or azotic gas. The&s;e exi&s;t together in the form of a <HI>mechanical</HI> mix|ture, but not in a &s;tate of <HI>chemical</HI> combination; and thus the volume of atmo&s;pherical air, who&s;e two &s;orts of particles, move freely to and among each other, in common circum&s;tances, contributes to the &s;upport of fire and animation.</P>
<P>But though the ingredients of the atmo&s;phere exi&s;t in a di&s;tinct and &s;eparate form in <HI>ordinary</HI> ca&s;es, yet this is not <HI>univer&s;ally</HI> the fact. <HI>Oxigene,</HI> the ba&s;is of vital air, and <HI>azote,</HI> the ba&s;e of foul air, though fre|quently disjoined, do however po&s;&s;e&s;s attractive pow|ers, &s;trong enough to make them oftentimes com|bine. The chief impediment to their union, is the clo&s;er affinity which they, in their ga&s;eous or aerial forms, po&s;&s;e&s;s for the caloric or matter of heat con|nected with them, and from which they derive their properties as ela&s;tic fluids. Whenever, therefore, oxigene and azote can come together without a&s;&s;um|ing the intervening form of gas or air, then they will unite according to the law of chemical affinities, and con&s;titute by their junction, a body or compound,
<PB N="158" REF="031593_0170_0FED523B13888CA0">
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing qualities very different from either of the con&s;tituent elements.</P>
<P>It is known from experiment, that both the&s;e ele|ments enter into the compo&s;ition of animal and vege|table &s;ub&s;tances. When oxigene unites with mere caloric, as in Fontana's experiments on in&s;ects, and Ingenhou&s;e's trials upon plants, then vital air will be the mia&s;ma proceeding therefrom. When azote e&s;|capes in connection with caloric only, as in Mr. Mitchill's own experiments, upon, the lean and mu&s;cu|lar parts of animals, and upon the air collected in the tumid bellies of animals, drowned or &s;trangled, the effluvium is atmo&s;pherical mephitis. When the two &s;ub&s;tances enter into combination with each other directly and immediately, without fir&s;t taking upon them&s;elves the aerial form, as in <HI>Ma&s;&s;ey</HI>'s experiments, the product is an acid, which, on addition of pot-a&s;h to it, forms nitre or &s;alt-petre.</P>
<P>Here, then, during the decompo&s;ition or putrefac|tion of organi&s;ed bodies, as in Thouvenel's experi|ments, in a range of heat equal to that which the &s;ur|face of the earth acquires on the American continent, in the &s;ummer time, is an acid compound, for<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed by chemical agency, from the &s;ame materials which con|&s;titute in their &s;eparate &s;tate, atmo&s;pherical air; and capable as in <HI>Lavoi&s;ier</HI>'s experiment, of being re&s;olv|ed into it by analy&s;is. This acid, which is thus af|forded during the decay or re&s;olution of organic matter, con&s;i&s;ts of the like ingredients as the air we live in, and differs from it but in two re&s;pects, to wit, the chemical connection of the materials and their different proportion. And the analogy between the atmo&s;phere, plants and animals, and the acid of &s;alt-petre, as to their formation and con&s;titution, mu&s;t be thus very apparent.</P>
<P><PB N="159" REF="031593_0171_0FED523F07B5ADB8">The&s;e points being determined, profe&s;&s;or Mitchill critici&s;es the preceding chymi&s;ts for their mi&s;take in cla&s;&s;ing this acid among the <HI>mineral</HI> &s;ub&s;tances, con|tends upon the authority of their own conce&s;&s;ions, that it is generally the re&s;ult of <HI>animal</HI> putrefaction; and profe&s;&s;es a reform of the French Nomenclature, that the language of &s;cience may truly corre&s;pond to facts. He accordingly derives the name of the radi|cal term, from the Greek word, &s;epo, to putrefy, and calls the azote of the French academicians <HI>&s;epton,</HI> the <HI>putrid principle</HI> or <HI>principle of putrefaction.</HI> He calls <HI>azotic air</HI> by the name of <HI>&s;eptous gas, dephlogi&s;ticated nitrous air, ga&s;eous oxyd of &s;epton, nitrous air, &s;eptic gas, nitrous acid, &s;eptous acid, nitric acid, &s;eptic acid,</HI> &amp;c. &amp;c. and thereby, in the very phra&s;eology, the origin and formation of the productions, are invariably &s;ugge&s;t|ed to the mind.</P>
<P>Having in this way reformed the language of Chymi&s;try, the profe&s;&s;or goes on to inquire, what is the evidence of nitrous or &s;eptous acid exi&s;ting in the atmo&s;phere, or in any of its modifications, a&s;|&s;uming a volatile or aerial form. That there is &s;ome|thing unwhole&s;ome and noxious in the exhalation from corrupting bodies, both of the vegetable and animal kind, has been long mi&s;erably experienced, though the preci&s;e nature of this has &s;carcely been imagined, but has rather been con&s;idered as lying beyond the reach of human re&s;earch. He finds with <HI>Margraaf</HI> that this very acid exi&s;ts in rain water, and concludes with <HI>Wat&s;on,</HI> that &s;now-water is not free from a tincture of it. He agrees with <HI>Chalmers</HI> in a&s;cribing to its operation, the &s;peedy ru&s;ting of me|tals in hot latitudes, where the pre&s;ence of an acid is
<PB N="160" REF="031593_0172_0FED5240B8B10FC0">
manife&s;t in the atmo&s;phere. But he does not &s;top here; for on con&s;idering that the plai&s;ter and wall of old buildings, has become impregnated with the &s;ep|tous or nitrous acid in the cour&s;e of time, e&s;pecially if the inhabitants have lived in an unclean manner, and the hou&s;es have &s;tood in the neighborhood of foul and corrupt vapours, he thinks the conclu&s;ion unde|niable that this acid mu&s;t have exi&s;ted in a ga&s;eous or vaporific form, before it was attracted by the clay or lime of the mortar. While in countries where &s;alt-petre is found &s;pontaneou&s;ly formed and &s;trewed over the &s;urface of the ground, the unhealthine&s;s of &s;uch regions is to be a&s;cribed to the agency of that very gas, which united in a more concentrated &s;tate with pota&s;h, con&s;titutes afterwards the nitre of the &s;oil.&mdash; The tarni&s;hing of metallic &s;ub&s;tances, highly colored &s;ilks, the human &s;kin and countenance, he con&s;iders as cau&s;ed in a great degree by the operation of the &s;ame deleterious fluid, extricated from putrefying bo|dies.</P>
<P>Such a ga&s;eous exhalation being now proved to exi&s;t, the profe&s;&s;or endeavors to &s;how that epidemic di&s;ea&s;es mu&s;t be occa&s;ioned by it, and not by any other known &s;pecies of aerial fluid. This mi&s;chiev|ous matter cannot be <HI>carbonic acid</HI> or <HI>fixed air,</HI> be|cau&s;e its effects upon animal bodies are entirely of a different kind, from tho&s;e manife&s;ted by infectious ailments. Nor can it be <HI>inflammable air</HI> or <HI>hydrogene gas,</HI> who&s;e extreme levity &s;oon elevates it high into the atmo&s;phere, or who&s;e inflammability or odorous nature would directly make its pre&s;ence evident to the &s;en&s;es. Still le&s;s can it be <HI>alkaline air</HI> or <HI>ammoniacal gas,</HI> which though commonly e&s;teemed one of the re&s;ults of putrefaction, is &s;eldom or ever afforded but by force of artificial fire, and if it was &s;pontaneou&s;ly evolved in low temperatures, would in&s;tantly lo&s;e its
<PB N="161" REF="031593_0173_0FED5245515F7AB0">
properties by combination with fixed air, or exhibit them to the no&s;trils by mingling with water. And nobody has ever imagined it was <HI>azotic</HI> or <HI>&s;eptous gas.</HI></P>
<P>It being thus <HI>negatively</HI> e&s;tabli&s;hed, that contagious air can be neither of the fluids now enumerated, Mr. M. inquires whether that very curious and wonderful modification of &s;eptous acid, called by PRIESTLY, <HI>dephlogi&s;ticated nitrous air,</HI> and by TROOSTWYCK and DEIMANN, <HI>the ga&s;eous oxyd of azote</HI> is not in mo&s;t ca&s;es the very cau&s;es of endemic maladies? This opi|nion he adopts, with this latitude and extent however, <HI>that the &s;eptous acid, as well in any other volatile form, as in that of the oxyd,</HI> may be, and is productive of exten&s;ive and dreadful &s;ickne&s;s. It is very abun|dantly produced in the operations of nature, and may not only be con&s;idered as evaporating from putrefying &s;ub&s;tances, but as formed in the atmo&s;phere, by the in&s;trumentality of lightning, after the manner of its production by electrical explo&s;ions in <HI>Cavendi&s;h's</HI> ex|periment.</P>
<P>The rea&s;ons why this plentiful production has ge|nerally been hitherto overlooked, are, 1&s;t. That as it has ever been con&s;idered a mineral &s;ub&s;tance, becau&s;e of its being u&s;ually procured by the decom|po&s;ition of nitre, no one has thought of inve&s;tigating its hi&s;tory, as an animal production: and 2ndly. Though it is fatal to breathing animals, yet it po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;es at the &s;ame time a power to &s;upport combu&s;|tion, and has few obviou&s;ly &s;en&s;ible qualities, &s;o that per&s;ons who have lived half their lives in an air more or le&s;s infected with it, never once imagined the ex|i&s;tence of &s;uch a thing.</P>
<P>To the&s;e products of putrefaction, all of which Mr. M. has made the &s;ubjects of public experiments, are
<PB N="162" REF="031593_0174_0FED524716495668">
the phenomena a&s;cribed to human and mar&s;h mia&s;|mata, to be referred. The copious extrication of &s;uch ga&s;es, their local origin, their limited diffu&s;ion, their deleterious effects, all point to &s;ome modification of the nitrous acid as their cau&s;e. And upon the prevalence and action of this kind of fluid in the at|mo&s;phere, does he account for the frequency and univer&s;ality of endemic and epidemic di&s;orders; re|jecting altogether the pretended di&s;tinction between contagion and mia&s;ma, concluding with <HI>Gardiner, Bingle and Carburi,</HI> that they are but varieties of the &s;ame thing, and differ from each other but in de|gree.</P>
<P>The exhalation from graves mentioned by <HI>Faur|croi,</HI> and from di&s;&s;ecting rooms de&s;cribed by <HI>St. John,</HI> as well as the <HI>Harmattan</HI> breezes of Guinea noticed by <HI>Lind,</HI> and the <HI>Simaom</HI> bla&s;ts of Arabia, witne&s;&s;ed by <HI>Bruce</HI>; he thinks are, in all probability, modifications of a &s;imilar aerial production. And this may &s;erve to give an idea of the extent and &s;cope of his &s;ea&s;on|ing on the occa&s;ional production of a gas, which while it continues to &s;urround and inve&s;t the inhabit|ants of particular &s;pots or countries; often de&s;troys their lives, or at lea&s;t impairs their health. The ef|fect of this being manife&s;ted upon the &s;kin and lungs only, appears in the form of intermitting and remitting &s;its, and in tho&s;e peculiar ca&s;es of anxious and &s;uffocating fever, of which &s;ome extreme and exqui&s;ite relations have been made by <HI>Lind, Chi&s;holm</HI> and <HI>Jack&s;on.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;ame rea&s;oning by which Mr. M. became convinced of the exi&s;tence and agency of tho&s;e vari|ous compounds of the &s;eptous principles, in <HI>cities, &s;wamps, and mar&s;hes,</HI> led him to examine whether
<PB N="163" REF="031593_0175_0FED524A332867B0">
they were not &s;ometimes produced within the <HI>Hu|man &s;tomach.</HI> The wor&s;t di&s;tempers we hear of in hot climates, occur le&s;s among the Natives, than among the Europeans, who for the purpo&s;es of com|merce or warfare, vi&s;it the torrid zone. They adapt their <HI>dre&s;s</HI> to the climate, but rarely make any alter|ation in their <HI>gro&s;s and northern diet.</HI> In hot coun|tries, the dige&s;tive powers are very apt to fail. The aliment, particularly among the Anglo-Americans and Engli&s;h, who love to eat their meat half raw, &s;oon runs into a putrefactive ma&s;s, and the corro&s;ive acid formed in the &s;ceptic proce&s;s, excites that &s;ad and &s;hocking train of &s;ymptoms, which con&s;titute and characterize the <HI>Yellow-Fever.</HI> This malady, the very name of which &s;trikes the citizens of the United States with terror, is &s;o particularly inherent in the &s;tomach and bowels, that <HI>Richter, Wade,</HI> and other well-informed practi&s;ers, have boldly termed di&s;tem|pers of this type, <HI>Inte&s;tinal,</HI> or <HI>Ga&s;tric,</HI> or <HI>Dy&s;enteric</HI> Fevers.</P>
<P>That the food of mo&s;t per&s;ons who &s;uffer by the&s;e complaints is in a con&s;iderable proportion, animal, and putrifies in the &s;tomach and inte&s;tines, no body has ever doubted. In a range of heat, not much greater than occurs in the &s;ubjacent earth, or &s;ur|rounding air, the products of putrefaction mu&s;t be nearly the &s;ame, <HI>in</HI> the &s;tomach, as <HI>out</HI> of it; and the &s;eptous principle, in &s;ome or other of its modifi|cations, be the re&s;ult. The greenne&s;s of the bilious di&s;charges, is evidence enough in many ca&s;es of the exi&s;tence of an acid in the alimentary canal; and was there not too much of it produced to be neutralized by that alkaline liquor, the bile, far le&s;s mi&s;chief would be done by it. And while <HI>fle&s;h-eaters</HI> are mi|&s;erably afflicted, he ob&s;erves that the Arabians, Gen|toos, Chine&s;e and Negroes, who, though inhabitants
<PB N="164" REF="031593_0176_0FED524C0A844E78">
of &s;ultry climates, &s;ub&s;i&s;t chiefly on <HI>vegetable fare,</HI> are very little affected by this kind of &s;ickne&s;s&mdash;Mo&s;t ve|getable &s;ub&s;tances being either le&s;s prone to corrupt, or if they putrefy, affording little or none of that <HI>pe|culiar azotic product</HI> which renders animal rottenne&s;s &s;o foul and de&s;tructive.</P>
<P>Thus, upon the idea of &s;ceptic acids and vapours, vitiating the pulmonic functions, and thereby imped|ing breathing, or interrupting the dige&s;tive proce&s;s, and eroding and inflaming the &s;tomach and inte&s;tines, Mr. Mitchill, thinks the phenomena of mo&s;t febrile ailments, whether of the endemic, epidemic, or dy&s;en|teric; contagious, infectious or ga&s;tric, intermittent, remittent or continued forms, may fully and fairly be explained.</P>
<P>Having by this mode of experimental inquiry a&s;|certained the proximate cau&s;e of fever, the profe&s;&s;or proceeds to give a <HI>theory of it</HI>; and after the manner of <HI>Cullen,</HI> takes a &s;ingle paroxy&s;m of an intermittent as an in&s;tance. Judging from its effects, he con&s;iders contagious air as always in &s;ome degree &s;timulant; though from its non-re&s;pirable property, operating upon the lungs in breathing, in &s;uch a way as by &s;ub|ducting heat and oxygene from the body, to dimini&s;h action and energy, and thus induces a &s;tate of <HI>direct debility.</HI> This debilitating proce&s;s may be carried &s;uddenly to a fatal extreme, as when the concentrated pe&s;tilential air, inhaled, kills upon the &s;pot; or when in a le&s;s noxious form, it may not extingui&s;h life im|mediately, but cau&s;e an anomalous di&s;ea&s;e of three days continuance, without remi&s;&s;ion, or in which there are five or &s;ix hot and cold fits, in twenty-four hours, eventually terminating in death. In a form yet more dilute and mild, epidemic air may occa&s;ion common remittent and intermittent di&s;tempers.</P>
<P><PB N="165" REF="031593_0177_0FED5250EEE77A10">The cold &s;tage of fever, Mr. Mitchill con&s;iders as depending upon <HI>impeded re&s;piration,</HI> and the impeded re&s;piration as depending upon <HI>the vitiated quality of the air</HI> taken into the lungs; or in &s;ome flighter ca&s;es, where the <HI>&s;tomach</HI> is originally thrown into a di&s;ordered condition, the lungs <HI>by a&s;&s;ociation with that organ,</HI> are thrown into a di&s;order too, and for a time perform their functions imperfectly.</P>
<P>Thus he pre&s;umes it is, that the impeded &s;tate of re&s;piration, is attended with a &s;maller evolution of heat and oxygene in the lungs, and con&s;equently with more or le&s;s diminution of the circulation of the blood, and a proportional degree of chilline&s;s or cold|ne&s;s throughout the body. The duration and degree of the cold fit will corre&s;pond to the continuance and power of the cau&s;es di&s;turbing the pulmonic organs, either by acting upon them <HI>directly</HI> or <HI>indirectly</HI> through the medium of the &s;tomach.</P>
<P>From the &s;mall quantity of <HI>heat</HI> and <HI>oxigene,</HI> com|municated to the blood in the lungs, and its con&s;e|quent &s;low and feeble circulation, can the &s;hrinking, palene&s;s, tremors, coldne&s;s, debility and other &s;ymp|toms, be &s;ufficiently explained, as the con&s;titution is now deprived of its <HI>two chief &s;timulants.</HI> But, why, it may be a&s;ked, does not the continued operation of the vitiated air upon the lungs, or the a&s;&s;ociated con|dition of the lungs with the &s;tomach, go on in an in|crea&s;ing &s;eries even unto death? It is a fact that &s;un|dry poi&s;onous &s;ub&s;tances grow by degrees <HI>habitual</HI> to the human con&s;titution, and by <HI>cu&s;tom</HI> lo&s;e their <HI>pri|mary</HI> operation. This di&s;po&s;ition to become <HI>familia|rized</HI> to contagious air, is particularly evident, as re|&s;pects the inhabitants of Guinea and the We&s;t-Indies. The con&s;titutions of the&s;e people are &s;o &s;ea&s;oned to the air and climate they live in, that in ordinary
<PB N="166" REF="031593_0178_0FED5252B3960630">
ca&s;es, it excites in them no di&s;turbance at all. Now, common paroxy&s;ms of intermitting fever, are in|&s;tances of <HI>temporary &s;ea&s;onings,</HI> which the con&s;titution experiences, of a kind quite analogous to what <HI>is perpetual</HI> with the Africans and Creoles.</P>
<P>The cold fit does &s;ometimes terminate, in death; and this happens when the con&s;titution <HI>cannot</HI> ac|quire the <HI>habit</HI> of enduring the noxious cau&s;e with impunity. In the generality of ca&s;es, however, the infectious gas lo&s;es its power of operation, before the con&s;titution is debilitated to death, and as &s;oon as it becomes for this time &s;o much <HI>accu&s;tomed</HI> to the con|tagious fluid, as no longer to be di&s;turbed by its pre|&s;ence, the cold fit ends. The length and violence of the cold fit will thus be, other circum&s;tances being equal, in a compound ratio, of the impediment given to the re&s;piration by the infectious gas, and the facility wherewith the con&s;titution <HI>accommodates</HI> it&s;elf to its action. If three per&s;ons then inhabit one hou&s;e, it is po&s;&s;ible that one of them may become &s;o quickly <HI>ac|cu&s;tomed</HI> to the air, as to have no di&s;temper; a &s;econd may have a moderate di&s;ea&s;e of a few fits; while the third, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a con&s;titution not ea&s;ily moulded to <HI>a new habit,</HI> may be incommoded by a violent and ob&s;tinate di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>In every paroxy&s;m of an intermittent, the infection <HI>thus wears it&s;elf out;</HI> but this is only a <HI>temporary recon|cilement</HI> of the body to its action. When after a re|petition of fits, the di&s;order becomes milder and milder, and after a while wholly cea&s;es, this is a ca&s;e of <HI>la&s;ting reconcilement.</HI> And in this way, may a large proportion of &s;mall intermittents <HI>cure them&s;elves,</HI> while the credit of it is given to the bark! This <HI>pow|er of habit</HI> daily does wonders, and labors more effec|tually
<PB N="167" REF="031593_0179_0FED525632D06C40">
for the good of the &s;ick than bark, opium and antimony put together.</P>
<P>The attack of contagion being thus <HI>for a time</HI> over|come, re&s;piration grows free, full and frequent; the lungs cea&s;e to be mole&s;ted by it; more vital air is decompounded there, and more &s;timulus is applied to the heart and arteries, by means of the increa&s;ed <HI>heat</HI> and <HI>oxygene</HI> now in the blood. The &s;timuli ope|rate more powerfully on account of the <HI>accumulated excitability</HI> of the body; and a degree of excitement is thence produced, which &s;ometimes ends in death, &s;ometimes cau&s;es delirium, and in almo&s;t every ca&s;e exceeds the healthy range of heat. Per&s;ons there|fore who die in the hot fit, die of the <HI>indirect debility</HI> induced by the increa&s;ed heat and oxygene, acting upon the <HI>increa&s;ed &s;u&s;ceptibility of the &s;y&s;tem.</HI></P>
<P>The duration and violence of the hot &s;tage will be, other things being alike, in a compound ratio of the <HI>excitability accumulated</HI> in the cold &s;tage, and the heat and oxygene evolved in the hot one. When the ex|citability is exhau&s;ted by the operation of the &s;timuli, the violence of action will cea&s;e, and the body grow cool.</P>
<P>The &s;weating &s;tage follows of cour&s;e, as in other ca&s;es of the &s;ub&s;idence of violent action. For after the exhau&s;ted excitability of the con&s;titution allows exce&s;&s;ive action to go on no longer, the re&s;piration grows more moderate and ea&s;y, the heart beats with le&s;s frequency and force, and the arterial contractions are more regular and health-like; and as the&s;e alte|rations go on, the hydrogene and oxygene of the blood, now run together in the extreme ve&s;&s;els of the &s;kin, and forms the moi&s;ture which bedews the &s;ur|face
<PB N="168" REF="031593_0180_0FED5257F8C9B070">
and this afterwards flying off by evaporation, cools by degrees the whole body down to its ordinary temperature. And as the arterial extremities of the re&s;t of the body, a&s;&s;ume their ordinary condition by the &s;ub&s;idence of excitement, the other &s;ecretions which had generally been &s;u&s;pended during the fit, now return as before. After this, the con&s;titution, &s;o far <HI>accu&s;tomed</HI> to the contagious poi&s;on, regains its former vigour and functions, as far as the exerci&s;e endured, and the functions injured during the &s;everal &s;tages, will allow.</P>
<P>His doctrine of fever in &s;hort, is conci&s;ely this:&mdash; The contagious fluid, by interfering with pulmonic action, brings on the <HI>cold &s;tage,</HI> and would continue the &s;ame until its termination in death, did not the con&s;titution in the mean time, acquire &s;uch a <HI>habit</HI> as to gain a <HI>temporary in&s;en&s;ibility</HI> to its action. This habit being induced, the cold &s;tage abates by rea&s;on of the &s;tate of <HI>direct debility</HI> into which the body had been brought; re&s;piration becomes con&s;e|quently quicker; heat and oxygene are let loo&s;e in the lungs, and becoming incorporated with the blood now warm, &s;timulate every part with more than u&s;ual power, and occa&s;ion the phenomena of the <HI>hot &s;tage,</HI> which terminates as &s;oon as the accumulated excitability of the &s;y&s;tem is &s;ufficiently exhau&s;ted.&mdash; The <HI>&s;weating &s;tage</HI> next en&s;ues, which after what has been &s;aid, hardly requires any further explanation.</P>
<P>The interval between one fit and the &s;ucceeding one, will be proportionate <HI>to the &s;trength and duration of the habit acquired,</HI> Some per&s;ons thus experience but <HI>one fit,</HI> and the di&s;ea&s;e vani&s;hes; for under the <HI>&s;ame</HI> circum&s;tances, they are never invaded by a <HI>&s;e|cond.</HI> Others &s;uffer <HI>two</HI> fits, or a <HI>&s;ucce&s;&s;ion</HI> of fits, and after a while become &s;o <HI>accu&s;tomed</HI> to the &s;timulus,
<PB N="169" REF="031593_0181_0FED525CFA8D5D58">
that if always applied in <HI>the &s;ame degree of &s;trength,</HI> its effect is no longer felt upon the body. In other in&s;tances again, &s;o <HI>hard</HI> is it for the con&s;titution to be moulded to a <HI>&s;ettled habit of oppo&s;ition,</HI> that after en|during a great number of inva&s;ions, it becomes &s;o enervated and worn down, as at length to die exhau&s;ted.</P>
<P>The &s;pecies of fevers whether quotidian, tertian, quartan, or of whatever type, will be determined by the readine&s;s or tardine&s;s wherewith the contagion gains <HI>a new a&s;cendancy</HI> over the body, or <HI>breaks the habit.</HI> And to this mobility of the animal frame, or ea&s;e with which the habit is broken, is to be a&s;crib|ed, as well the frequency of the returns, as the length and &s;everity of the paraxyoms.</P>
<P>The <HI>anomalous</HI> ca&s;es of fevers, which have puzzled Phy&s;icians to explain and no&s;ologi&s;ts to arrange, are as Mr. M. thinks, thus very naturally accounted for; &s;ince according to the <HI>variation</HI> of the cau&s;e (&s;ince the contagious atmo&s;phere may be more or le&s;s den&s;e or concentrated, and may be more or le&s;s charged with carbonic acid, hydrogene gas, and other non-re&s;pir|able airs) will be the variety in the effect produced, and as there may be infinite gradations in the noxious cau&s;e, &s;o there may be endle&s;s variations in the morbid effect, which it would be impo&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe in words, and u&s;ele&s;s if it could be accompli&s;hed.</P>
<P>Hence he explains why a <HI>&s;ucce&s;&s;ion of fits long conti|nued,</HI> may di&s;po&s;e the con&s;titution to a repetition of fits, even when the morbid cau&s;e is away. For though there may be a <HI>habit produced</HI> of in&s;en&s;ibility to contagion, yet a habit may in the mean time be e&s;tabli&s;hed in the bodily motions, of falling periodi|cally into <HI>trains of action,</HI> even when the original
<PB N="170" REF="031593_0182_0FED525EB4B6D3C8">
cau&s;e is withheld or removed. Here then there will be produced <HI>a habit of having paroxy&s;ms</HI> after the manner of <HI>temporary &s;ea&s;onings,</HI> while at the &s;ame time there may be a habit formed of re&s;i&s;ting contagion altogether, or of obtaining a <HI>permanent &s;ea&s;oning as to that.</HI></P>
<P>And to <HI>this principle</HI> of the animal frame, he thinks may be referred all the febrile ailments from the mo&s;t trifling intermittent to the more &s;erious remit|tent, and to the &s;olemn forms of continued fevers; without calling in the aid, even mentioning the names of <HI>&s;pa&s;m, vis medicatrix,</HI> or <HI>reaction of the &s;y&s;|tem:</HI> always wi&s;hing to be under&s;tood as compre|hending within the pre&s;ent theory, the animal move|ments referable to the before-mentioned cau&s;es &s;olely, and not extending it to embrace common catarrh, quin&s;y, pleuri&s;y, peripneumony, rhumati&s;m and other di&s;ea&s;es of the pyrexious type, which Mr. Mit|chill &s;uppo&s;es to proceed from another and a very different cau&s;e.</P>

<HEAD><HI>LETTER FIRST.</HI> On the Origin, Symptoms, &amp;c. of the Yellow Fever, in New-Haven. <HI>DR. MONSON, JUN. TO THE PUBLISHER.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN giving a hi&s;tory of the origin of the Yellow, or Pe&s;tilential Fever, as it appeared in this City, in the year 1794, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to premi&s;e &s;ome account of tho&s;e di&s;ea&s;es which prevailed here, imme|diately before; that the Public may be enabled to judge whether there is any analogy between them and the Fever in que&s;tion.</P>
<P>Sometime in 1792 and 1793, the Scarlet Fever, or Ulcerous Sore Throat, made its appearance in Litchfield, Water-town, and the towns in the vicinity of New-Haven; and raged with great mortality.</P>
<P>In September and October 1793, many of the Inhabitants of this town were affected with a &s;light Influenza; &s;tinging pains in their jaws and limbs, &s;orene&s;s in the mu&s;cles of the neck, with a light Fe|ver.
<PB N="174" REF="031593_0185_0FED5269C4A7FC70">
&mdash;In November and December following, &s;everal children were affected with the Ulcerous Sore Throat. The &s;ymptoms were not alarming; and in every in|&s;tance it terminated favorably.&mdash;In January 1794, the di&s;ea&s;e a&s;&s;umed a more malignant appearance. In February, March, April, May, June and July, it was highly putrid; and many fell victims to its ma|lignity.</P>
<P>On the 10th of June 1794, the Pe&s;tilential, or Yellow Fever, appeared here.&mdash;Doctor Hotchki&s;s vi|&s;ited I&s;aac Gorham's wife, on the <HI>Long-Wharf.</HI>&mdash; She complained of a violent pain in her head, back and limbs; her eyes were dull, and &s;lightly inflamed; &s;he had nau&s;ea at &s;tomach, was ob&s;tinately co&s;tive, with a moderate degree of Fever. No marks of in|flammation were di&s;coverable, by in&s;pection, in the throat.&mdash;The di&s;tre&s;sful &s;ymptoms, above-mentioned, continued till the fourteenth; when her pain and di&s;tre&s;s &s;uddenly &s;ub&s;ided; and &s;he was elated with the pro&s;pect of a &s;peedy recovery. In the evening, &s;he vomited matter re&s;embling coffee-grounds; and died on the 15th.&mdash;The Phy&s;ician, who attended her, was ignorant of her complaint till he &s;aw what &s;he vomited. He then declared her di&s;ea&s;e to be the Yellow Fever.</P>
<P>On the 15th of June, I vi&s;ited Elias Gorham's daughter, a child of 8 years of age, in Chapel-&s;treet, three quarters of a mile from I&s;aac Gorham's hou&s;e. She had been &s;ick three days; her countenance was flu&s;hed with a deep red colour; her eyes were dull, and highly inflamed; &s;he had violent pain in her head, back, and limbs; nau&s;ea, and frequent vo|miting; ob&s;tinate co&s;tivene&s;s; a quick, full, hard, throbbing pul&s;e; her &s;kin was hot and dry; and her tongue covered with a thick white fur. On the
<PB N="175" REF="031593_0186_0FED526B768DC648">
16th, her pain and di&s;tre&s;s &s;uddenly abated; in a few hours, &s;he vomited up matter re&s;embling coffee-grounds; and died the next day.&mdash;I in&s;pected her throat, during her illne&s;s, and could di&s;cover no marks of inflammation.</P>
<P>I was &s;urpri&s;ed at the &s;ingular appearance of the di&s;ea&s;e, and hearing of the death of Mrs. Gorham (I&s;aac Gorham's wife) inquired of the mother if her daughter had been on the <HI>wharf.</HI> She informed me that the child had lived with her aunt (I&s;aac Gor|ham's wife) nearly a week.</P>
<P>The 23d of June, I vi&s;ited the child's mother. She complained of violent pain in her head, back, and limbs; nau&s;ea; frequent vomiting; ob&s;tinate co&s;|tivene&s;s; with a con&s;iderable degree of fever. The&s;e &s;ymptoms continued five or &s;ix days; then gradu|ally abated; and &s;oon after &s;he recovered her u&s;ual health.</P>
<P>On the 20th of June, Mr. Elijah Au&s;tin died in New-York; and his clerk, Henry Hubbard, died in Derby. They complained within three or four hours of each other; and Mr. Hubbard vomited matter re&s;embling coffee-grounds.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of this town were alarmed at the&s;e &s;udden deaths, and reque&s;ted the <HI>Select-Men</HI> to make diligent inquiry into the origin of this di&s;|ea&s;e.</P>
<P>On examination, it appeared&mdash;That, in the be|ginning of June, Capt. Truman arrived from Mar|tinico, in a &s;loop that was infected with the contagion of the Yellow Fever: that this ve&s;&s;el lay at the <HI>wharf,</HI> within a few rods of I&s;aac Gorham's hou&s;e: that &s;he
<PB N="176" REF="031593_0187_0FED526D2C665158">
had on board a <HI>che&s;t of clothes,</HI> which had belonged to a mariner, who died of the Yellow Fever, in Mar|tinico; and that his che&s;t was carried into Mr. Au&s;|tin's &s;tore, and opened in the pre&s;ence of Capt. Tru|man, Mr. Au&s;tin, Henry Hubbard, and Polly Gor|ham; the three la&s;t mentioned of whom, died, in a &s;hort time after their expo&s;ure to the contents of the che&s;t.&mdash;Hence it is highly probable that Mrs. Gor|ham caught the di&s;ea&s;e from the infected &s;loop, or clothing. Mr. Au&s;tin's &s;tore &s;tands within three or four rods of I&s;aac Gorham's hou&s;e; and no per&s;on in town was known to have the Yellow Fever previ|ous to Capt. Truman's arrival.</P>
<P>June 26th, I&s;aac Gorham lo&s;t an infant child with the Yellow Fever; and &s;oon after his &s;on and daugh|ter were affected with it:&mdash;the former died.&mdash;Solo|mon Mudge died on the 30th; Jacob Thom&s;on's negro woman, on the 1&s;t of July; Archibald M'Neil on the 9th; Polly Brown on the 3d of Augu&s;t; John Storer, jun. and John Hide, on the 8th: and widow Thom&s;on, on the 10th.&mdash;Jacob Thom&s;on's negro woman, Solomon Mudge, John Storer, jun. and John Hide, had vi&s;ited Mr. Gorham's hou&s;e, a few days before their illne&s;s; Polly Brown and Mrs. Thom|&s;on, nur&s;ed in Mr. Gorham's family; and Archibald M'Neil nur&s;ed Solomon Mudge.&mdash;Elias Gill, died on the 12th of Augu&s;t; and Samuel Gri&s;wold's wife, on the 7th: the former, vi&s;ited Mr. Gorham's hou&s;e; the latter nur&s;ed in his family.</P>
<P>There were a number of per&s;ons who caught the di&s;ea&s;e at Mr. Gorham's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, and recovered.</P>
<P>Mrs. Thom&s;on, on the fir&s;t day of her illne&s;s, was moved half a mile from Mr. Gorham's, into George-&s;treet. Luther Fitch, caught the di&s;ea&s;e from Mrs.
<PB N="177" REF="031593_0188_0FED526FEA8D1CB8">
Thom&s;on, and communicated it to his &s;ervant maid. Both recovered.&mdash;Mr. Fitch lives in College-&s;treet, nearly three quarters of a mile di&s;tant from Mr. Gor|ham's hou&s;e.&mdash;I could trace the di&s;ea&s;e throughout the town. No per&s;on had the Yellow Fever, unle&s;s in con&s;equence of attending the &s;ick, or of being ex|po&s;ed by nur&s;es, infected hou&s;es, clothing, or furni|ture.</P>
<P>I have inquired of &s;everal aged per&s;ons in this town, relative to the yellow Fever, whether they knew of its having ever been here, previous to June 1794, and there is but a &s;ingle in&s;tance; the facts relating to which are the&s;e:&mdash;In the year 1743, a tran&s;ient per&s;on, by the name of Nevins, who came from the We&s;t-Indies, lodged at the hou&s;e of Nathaniel Brown, an inn-keeper, in this city. The man was taken very &s;ick, in the night; and died &s;hortly afterwards; and his body was very yellow, after death.&mdash;Mr. Brown's wife &s;ickened in a &s;hort time, and died, of the &s;ame complaint; which was, at that time, &s;uppo&s;ed to be the Yellow Fever.</P>
<P>I am credibly informed that &s;everal per&s;ons, at Mill-River, in Fairfield county, and al&s;o at New-London, died with the Yellow Fever, in Augu&s;t and Septem|ber 1795. It was propagated there by infected per|&s;ons from New-York.</P>
<P>Capt. John Smith died in this town, the 20th of Augu&s;t 1795. He caught the di&s;ea&s;e in New-York, and communicated it to one of his negro &s;ervants.</P>
<P><PB N="178" REF="031593_0189_0FED5272A1080A18">The following is an account of the number who died, with the Yellow Fever, in New-Haven, in the different months of the year 1794.</P>

<P>Of this number, forty-eight vomited matter re|&s;embling coffee-grounds, or port wine.&mdash;There were about a hundred and &s;ixty per&s;ons who had the Yellow Fever.&mdash;Three per&s;ons recovered who vo|mitted matter like coffee-grounds; but none re|covered, that I remember, who vomited matter re|&s;embling port wine.&mdash;Some vomited a vi&s;cid, tough mucus, &s;imilar to the white of an egg; others, mat|ter like chocolate; which were as fatal as the black vomit.</P>
<P>The Yellow-Fever was attended with &s;pecific con|tagion in every in&s;tance, and proved equally mortal in every part of the town, in proportion to the number that were &s;ick. No age, nor &s;ex, were ex|empted from it's ravages. All de&s;criptions of peo|ple were alike &s;u&s;ceptible of receiving the conta|gion.</P>
<P>In the month of September, when the Yellow Fever raged with the greate&s;t violence, the inhabit|ants, in general, were almo&s;t entirely free from every other complaint. It was remarked by the

<P>It was computed that 750 per&s;ons had the Scarlet Fever.&mdash;This di&s;ea&s;e appeared in almo&s;t every family in town, indi&s;criminately; and was evidently, an Epidemical di&s;ea&s;e, which originated in the con&s;ti|tution of the air,&mdash;while the Yellow Fever was pro|pagated only by contagion.</P>
<P>The &s;ymptoms of the Yellow Fever, generally, were as follow:&mdash;Languor; la&s;&s;itude; rigors; a dull, heavy, inflamed eye, with a dilated pupil; the coun|tenance flu&s;hed, with a deep red color; violent pain, in the head, back, and limbs; nau&s;ea; frequent vo|miting of matter highly bilious; bitter ta&s;te in the mouth; tongue covered with a thick, whiti&s;h or yel|low fur; a very quick, full, hard, throbbing pul&s;e; &s;kin hot and dry; thir&s;t very incon&s;iderable; ob&s;ti|nate

co&s;tivene&s;s&mdash;and when &s;tools were procured, they were of a bottle-green color, or re&s;embled tar, or mola&s;&s;es:&mdash;The&s;e were the general characteri&s;tics of the di&s;ea&s;e; when it appeared highly inflammato|ry.&mdash;In &s;ome in&s;tances, the pul&s;e was very &s;low&mdash; dimini&s;hed in frequency below the healthy &s;tandard&mdash; and very feeble; there was great oppre&s;&s;ion about the precordia; faintne&s;s; di&s;po&s;ition to coma; a &s;illy look of the eye; exqui&s;ite irritability of the &s;tomach; con&s;tant vomiting; faultering in the &s;peech; the coun|tenance of a tawny, or copper color; tongue moi&s;t, without any fur, and of a blui&s;h or coal black ap|pearance.&mdash;In &s;ome I ob&s;erved a tort, quick, &s;mall pul&s;e, and &s;ometimes &s;low, which would ri&s;e on bleed|ing, and become quicker and fuller.</P>
<P>Where the di&s;ea&s;e raged with great violence, and was highly malignant, the remi&s;&s;ions of Fever were &s;carcely perceptible to the mo&s;t attentive ob&s;erver.</P>
<P>The pul&s;e would continue hard and full, till within a few hours before death; when the pain, di&s;tre&s;s, and fever, would &s;uddenly abate, and the pul&s;e re|turn to its healthy &s;tandard. Soon after, the &s;ick were affected with a vomiting of matter, re&s;embling coffee-grounds, or port-wine; or with a coldne&s;s of the extremities, which gradually increa&s;ed, till death clo&s;ed the &s;cene.</P>
<P>When the di&s;ea&s;e terminated favorably, there was a gradual remi&s;&s;ion of the fever, pain, di&s;tre&s;s, nau|&s;ea, and vomiting.</P>
<P>Some were affected, on the third or fourth day, with hemorrhage, from the no&s;e and gums; and &s;ometimes, the&s;e &s;ymptoms would occur at a later period.</P>
<P><PB N="181" REF="031593_0192_0FED527CC690BD88">Others were affected with petechiae, carbuncles, and livid &s;pots, on the face and brea&s;t, as large as a dollar. One patient had a number of livid blotches, as large as a dam&s;on; &s;ome of which di&s;charged a dark-colored, bloody matter. This patient recovered, on the 27th day of the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>A young woman had the black vomit, on the third day of her illne&s;s. On the &s;ixth, &s;he had a large ab|&s;ce&s;s form, on the &s;uperior part of the right thigh, near the head of the Os Femoris; and a large car|buncle, on her loins, of the bigne&s;s of a common &s;ized bread cake, and of a livid color. It &s;uppu|rated on the tenth day; the mortified parts &s;loughed off, and denuded the &s;pine. On the &s;ame day, &s;he had a deep ab&s;ce&s;s form on the left thigh, nearly op|po&s;ite to the one on her right. The&s;e ab&s;ce&s;&s;es pro|duced deep, &s;inuous ulcers, which did not heal till the fourth month of her &s;ickne&s;s. On the fifth month, &s;he was able to walk, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of crutches; and &s;oon after regained her health.</P>
<P>Capt. David Phipps's wife, on the ninth day of her illne&s;s, was affected with the hiccoughs, and died on the eighteenth. On the &s;eventeenth, &s;he expec|torated matter of an orange green colour, and ex|tremely fetid.&mdash;I have mentioned this circum&s;tance as a rare occurrence; very few being affected with hiccoughing, or &s;ub&s;ultus tendinum.</P>
<P>The Yellow Fever generally proved fatal on the third, fourth, fifth, and &s;ixth days. There were three or four in&s;tances of its terminating fatally in thirty-&s;ix hours. If the patient &s;urvived the &s;eventh day, he almo&s;t always recovered. At this period the fever frequently appeared to make a complete cri&s;is. On the eighth day, it a&s;&s;umed the type of a double re|mittent:

two di&s;tinct remi&s;&s;ions were evident in the cour&s;e of twenty-four hours, accompanied by profu&s;e and intolerably fetid &s;weats, and often with white and read miliary eruptions.

It often continue<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> till the twenty third or twenty fourth day, and abated gradually.&mdash; In the cour&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e, they often vomited a large quantity of green bile,&mdash;re&s;embling the ex|pre&s;&s;ed juice of red pepper leaves. This evacu|ation &s;eemed to relieve the di&s;agreeable nau&s;ea which mo&s;t of them were affected with.&mdash;The di&s;|charge of bile was commonly the effort of nature; gentle emetics, &s;eldom or never, procuring a di&s;|charge of bile.</P>
<P>I &s;aw two in&s;tances of reinfection.</P>
<P>The effects of the contagion were, generally, obvi|ous on the third, fourth, or fifth day, after expo&s;ure. In one in&s;tance they did not appear till the thir|teenth.</P>
<P>The bodies, of tho&s;e who died of the Yellow Fe|ver, were either of a tawny, or copper color: Some were of a deep yellow; and one almo&s;t of an orange green. Three appeared as if they were &s;prinkled with ink.</P>
<P>In re&s;pect to the origin and nature of the di&s;ea&s;e under con&s;ideration, I e&s;teem it ju&s;tifiable to rea&s;on from facts alone. I am fully of opinion that the Yellow Fever is &s;eldom, or never, generated in this country, and that it is always imported from abroad. An objection to the idea of its being generated in this country is, that it was never known in the interior of this &s;tate, or of the United States; &s;o far as I can
<PB N="183" REF="031593_0194_0FED5281DA325068">
learn. Had it ever appeared in Connecticut, before the year 1743, and June 1794, we &s;hould, undoubt|edly, have had &s;ome record of the fact. There is no &s;uch record, and no per&s;on remembers to have heard of &s;uch a di&s;ea&s;e, but at the&s;e periods, prevailing in any part of the &s;tate. There are numbers of aged per&s;ons in New-Haven, who remember the Putrid Ulcerous Sore Throat, Small-pox, Meazles, Dy&s;en|tery, &amp;c. raging here, with great mortality; but have no recollection of any Yellow Fever. Hence we may rationally conclude that it never did appear, in this &s;tate, but in the years 1743, and 1794.</P>
<P>It is evident, from facts before-mentioned, in this letter, that the Yellow Fever was propagated in no other way than by contagion; and that this is a <HI>&s;pe|cific contagion,</HI> and no more diver&s;ified, in its opera|tion on the human &s;y&s;tem, than that of the Small-pox and Meazles.</P>
<P>If the citizens of large commercial cities were at|tentive in tracing the origin of the Yellow Fever, on its fir&s;t appearing among them, they would often find that the di&s;ea&s;e was imported. In &s;ome in&s;tances it would be extremely difficult to di&s;cover the origin.&mdash; But the mi&s;chief lies in this&mdash;that the inhabitants of &s;uch cities, whenever a contagious di&s;ea&s;e makes its appearance among them, endeavor to &s;uppre&s;s all rumor of it, from an apprehen&s;ion of alarming the country, and injuring their commerce: unwilling to believe that there is evil in the city, till the di&s;ea&s;e &s;preads in every direction. Then, indeed, when it is too late, they are &s;olicitous in the u&s;e of means to arre&s;t its progre&s;s. As it extends it&s;elf &s;lowly, at fir&s;t,
<PB N="184" REF="031593_0195_0FED52864B995858">
&s;ea&s;onable exertion might both detect its &s;ource, and prevent its increa&s;e; but when it is diffu&s;ed through a city, it &s;preads with rapidity, and it is no longer po&s;|&s;ible to di&s;cover where it began.&mdash;But as, whenever the Yellow Fever has appeared in the United States, it has always been in &s;ea-port towns, and originated near wharves, docks, and warehou&s;es, there &s;eems to be high probability that the di&s;ea&s;e is imported.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE communication which accompanies this, from my Son, contains an account, &s;ufficiently minute, of the origin, &s;ymptoms, fatality, &amp;c. of the Yellow Fever, as it appeared in New-Haven, in 1794, together with his rea&s;ons for believing it to be a di&s;ea&s;e of foreign derivation, and of &s;pecific conta|gion.&mdash;I have re&s;erved to my&s;elf the ta&s;k of convey|ing to you &s;ome information re&s;pecting the plan of cure generally adopted; on the <HI>juvantia</HI> and <HI>ceden|tia;</HI> and relative to &s;poradic ca&s;es with &s;imilar &s;ymp|toms.</P>
<P><PB N="185" REF="031593_0196_0FED528948352688">In June 1794, when the pe&s;tilential or Yellow Fever, made its fir&s;t appearance here, the Scarlatina Angino&s;a was rife, with great malignancy. It did not, at all, admit of the u&s;e of the lancet; but, on the contrary, we found the bark, mineral acids, and high &s;timulating cordials, mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful in promot|ing the cure. This Fever exhibited con&s;iderable va|riety of &s;ymptoms, in different circum&s;tances and habits. Sometimes, the &s;orene&s;s of the throat pre|ceded the &s;carlatinous efflore&s;cence; at others, the cuticular eruption appeared previous to the difficulty of &s;wallowing and &s;orene&s;s of the throat: and in others, again, there was no eruption on the &s;kin, from fir&s;t to la&s;t, and only a temporary complaint in the throat, but a gangrenous affection of the Ten&s;ils, which was &s;oon communicated to the habit, and proved &s;uddenly fatal. The Scarlatina Angino&s;a be|ing thus the con&s;titutional Epidemic, and u&s;hered in with many of the &s;ame &s;ymptoms with the &s;uper|vening Pe&s;tilential Fever, it will not appear very ex|traordinary that, on its fir&s;t appearance, the one &s;hould be mi&s;taken for the other. This was the ca&s;e, in re&s;pect to a number of tho&s;e fir&s;t &s;eized with the Yellow Fever; who being treated with bark and cordials, without much previous evacuation, rarely recovered. Indeed, of &s;eventeen, or eighteen, who were earlie&s;t affected, fourteen died. But, whether this &s;hould be a&s;cribed to the treatment, at this period, &s;olely, or to the nature and virulence of the infection, I am not &s;atisfied. For I am confident that the Fever a&s;&s;umed a more malignant a&s;pect in tho&s;e who received the infection from the <HI>Fomites</HI> of the di&s;ea&s;e (which was mo&s;tly the ca&s;e at fir&s;t) than where it was derived immediately from the bodies of the &s;ick: which ob&s;ervation, if ju&s;t, confirms the opi|nion of Dr. Cullen, re&s;pecting contagion.</P>
<P><PB N="186" REF="031593_0197_0FED528B0B56D8E8">This extraordinary mortality having convinced us of the impropriety of tru&s;ting to, or u&s;ing, cordials, bark, &amp;c. we, with one accord, had recour&s;e to the lancet; endeavoring, at the &s;ame time, early to clean&s;e the fir&s;t pa&s;&s;ages with &s;trong purges, compo&s;ed of Jalap, Calomel, and Aloes: for the &s;ick were ob|&s;tinately co&s;tive, in general, and required much phy|&s;ic to move them, and frequent repetitions to keep the bowels open. The&s;e evacuations were very evi|dently attended with the mo&s;t &s;peedy relief of head-ach, nau&s;ea, and oppre&s;&s;ion; the &s;tools procured, by the purges, were commonly of a greeni&s;h, or dark bi|lious tinge; and, where the bile was brought off co|piou&s;ly, it was not u&s;ual to &s;ee that yellowi&s;h &s;uffu&s;ion of the eyes, and &s;urface of the &s;kin, throughout the cour&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e, which was formerly accounted a principal diagno&s;tic, and has given name to the Fever.</P>
<P>The repetition of the lancet was nece&s;&s;ary, to third or fourth day, in &s;ome habits, as were the mercurial purges.</P>
<P>There was little dependence to be placed on diapo|retics, by rea&s;on of the extreme irritability of the &s;tomach.</P>
<P>Baths and fomentations, in &s;ome ca&s;es, were highly palliative.</P>
<P>The fermenting mixture, &s;ometimes re&s;trained the vomiting. This effect was, likewi&s;e, produced by bli&s;ters, applied to the region of the &s;tomach. When applied ju&s;t above the knees, they appeared to be attended by decided advantage, in dimini&s;hing the frequency of vomiting, relieving the head, palliating nervous affections, removing coma, and encouraging diaphore&s;is.</P>
<P><PB N="187" REF="031593_0198_0FED528DF60481A8">Cly&s;ters, often thrown up into the bowels, were peculiarly &s;erviceable, not only to a&s;&s;i&s;t in effecting the more ea&s;y and thorough tran&s;it of the Phy&s;ic, but to cool the bowels, attenuate the vi&s;cid colluvies, and di&s;po&s;e to per&s;piration.</P>
<P>The Bark, in the decline of the Fever, an&s;wered a good purpo&s;e, where it could be retained; but there were but very few who could bear it in &s;ub&s;tance, and not many in any form.</P>
<P>Opium, whether admini&s;tered to relieve pain, or &s;tay the vomiting, was ob&s;erved to have the mo&s;t pernicious as effects; e&s;pecially in the early &s;tage of the di&s;ea&s;e. A man and his wife, who had been accu&s;|tomed to the u&s;e of Laudanum, on former occa&s;ions, when &s;eized with the di&s;tre&s;&s;ing &s;ymptoms of this Fever, had recour&s;e (in the beginning of their illne&s;s, and previous to any medical advice) to the liberal u&s;e of that medicine, for the relief of their pains; and both died in about thirty &s;ix-hours.</P>
<P>A free, cool, well-ventilated apartment was of the greate&s;t importance.</P>
<P>The pa&s;&s;ions of the mind had a very &s;en&s;ible effect on the &s;ick.&mdash;The pa&s;&s;ion of fear, in particular, was not only highly predi&s;po&s;ing to the reception of the contagion, but a very fatal concomitant. Hence the pu&s;illanimous and fearful, when expo&s;ed to the cau&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e, rarely e&s;caped; and hence the fatal con&s;equences which, in &s;undry in&s;tances, followed from funeral knells, which were, in general, mani|fe&s;tly detrimental.</P>
<P>On the 6th of September, I was my&s;elf &s;eized with the common &s;ymptoms of the Fever. My ha|bit being &s;lender, and as I had been wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n down with
<PB N="188" REF="031593_0199_0FED529231548270">
fatigue and much expo&s;ed to the night air, I was cau|tious of u&s;ing the phy&s;ic in the quantity I had been wont to give it to my patients; at the &s;ame time fearful I &s;hould not be able to retain it on my &s;tomach. I found, by the gradual introduction of it, I had, by the third day, con&s;iderably affected my habit with the mercury. I no &s;ooner perceived my gums and fauces touched, than I found that almo&s;t intolerable oppre&s;&s;ion about the precordia yeilding and &s;ub&s;id|ing.&mdash;Upon reflection, I recollected a circum&s;tance which before I had not attended to&mdash;That, where the mercury, in the purging pills generally u&s;ed, had &s;o far in&s;inuated it&s;elf into the habit as to produce any &s;orene&s;s of the mouth and gums, the patients had univer&s;ally recovered. I mentioned this circum&s;tance to my brethren of the faculty, who, on recollection, a&s;&s;ured me that their uniform experience confirmed the fact: none of them having lo&s;t a patient, where the mercury had produced ptyali&s;m.</P>
<P>Thenceforward our main object, after clean&s;ing the fir&s;t pa&s;&s;ages, was to introduce mercury into the &s;y&s;tem, as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible, both by the &s;tomach and by friction.&mdash;This appeared to be a more eligible and &s;ucce&s;sful treatment, than to repeat the mercurial purges through the cour&s;e of the Fever.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the evident &s;ymptoms of inflam|mation, in this Fever, I cannot &s;ay but that, in &s;undry in&s;tances, large and repeated bleedings appeared to &s;ink the patient, and proved detrimental; and purg|ing, al&s;o, was &s;ometimes, carried to exce&s;s. Yet, in no in&s;tance, was bleeding pu&s;hed to near that extre|mity, as was often practi&s;ed in Philadelphia.&mdash;I would not, however, be under&s;tood, in any mea&s;ure, to cen&s;ure the practice of the faculty in Philadelphia; for it is well known that di&s;ea&s;es of the &s;ame name
<PB N="189" REF="031593_0200_0FED52955236F2D8">
and type, at different times and places, require dif|ferent treatment. The Yellow Fever, too, when it prevailed among us, may be &s;uppo&s;ed to partake, in &s;ome degree, of the nature of the con&s;titutional epi|demic then exi&s;ting;&mdash;I mean the Scarlatina Angi|no&s;a, in which nothing was more fatal than the lan|cet: for, whatever inflammatory &s;ymptoms appeared in the beginning, there was almo&s;t univer&s;ally, a &s;ud|den tran&s;ition, from the inflammatory, to the putrid diathe&s;is, which called for the early u&s;e of tonics, and highly &s;timulating cordials. And the Yellow Fever, though u&s;hered in with &s;trong inflammatory &s;ymptoms, yet terminated, when fatal, with tho&s;e of an oppo&s;ite nature.</P>
<P>There were no di&s;&s;ections made in this town; but, from all the &s;ymptoms attending, I could not have entertained a doubt of finding a morbid affection of the liver, had not gentlemen of the faculty, and emi|nent in their profe&s;&s;ion, in Philadelphia, and in other places where this Fever has prevailed, decided to the contrary. But there has never been, I believe, any uniform appearance of this Vi&s;cus di&s;covered on the di&s;&s;ection of tho&s;e who have fallen a &s;acrifice to this di&s;ea&s;e.&mdash;But if the liver be not primarily affected, may it not be a que&s;tion whether the remarkable yel|lowne&s;s, noted in the eye, and over the whole &s;urface of the body, be any thing more than a con&s;equence of that co&s;tive, torpid &s;tate of the inte&s;tines, in the early &s;tage of the di&s;ea&s;e, which, by retaining the bile, now con&s;tantly pouring into them in its u&s;ual, or perhaps increa&s;ed quantity (as may be &s;uppo&s;ed from increa&s;ed excitement of Fever) allows an ab|&s;orption by the Cacteals to take place, and thus pro|duce this phenomenon&mdash;according to the &s;ugge&s;tion of M. Portal?</P>
<P><PB N="190" REF="031593_0201_0FED52983592B0F0">Many circum&s;tances &s;eem to favor the idea that the liver is affected primarily: &s;uch is the pain, either dull or acute, &s;o univer&s;ally perceptible on pre&s;&s;ure with the hand on the region of that vi&s;cus, and which increa&s;es with the di&s;ea&s;e;&mdash;(and I have known it to that degree, that half the weight of one's hand would produce &s;wooning)&mdash;and &s;uch, al&s;o, is that ten&s;ity and di&s;tention of the integuments.&mdash;Both Warren and Hillary &s;uppo&s;ed the liver to be the &s;eat of the Fever; and Dr. Broag, who performed many di&s;&s;ections in this Fever, and in the Dy&s;entery of hot climates, ob&s;erves that the liver was almo&s;t always found di&s;ea&s;ed. And Dr. Hunter remarks, that a di&s;ea&s;ed &s;tate of the liver and &s;pleen has an intimate connection with the di&s;ea&s;es of hot climates.</P>
<P>But whether the di&s;ea&s;e of the &s;tomach and inte&s;|tines precede that of the liver, or the rever&s;e, they mu&s;t all be more or le&s;s affected, in the progre&s;s of the Fever. For it cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed that &s;o violent and long-continued a derangement of the alimentary canal, as is evident in the Yellow Fever, could take place, without extending its di&s;order to the functions of the liver, if not to its very &s;ub&s;tance.&mdash;But per|haps a deci&s;ion on this point can make little altera|tion in the method of cure; a local inflammation in any of the Vi&s;cera being, doubtle&s;s, to be &s;ubmitted to the &s;ame general plan of treatment.</P>
<P>There is nothing in the hi&s;tories of the Yellow Fever, which I have &s;een, more extraordinary than that gentlemen, clearly eminent in the profe&s;&s;ion, &s;hould &s;o decidedly give it as their opinion that the di&s;ea&s;e is not infectious. Dr. Hunter remarks that, in no in&s;tance, did the Yellow Fever prove more in|fectious
<PB N="191" REF="031593_0202_0FED5299EC05E1D8">
than the Remittent; and that it was to him matter of con&s;olation to be able to declare it not to be an infectious di&s;ea&s;e. And Dr. Mo&s;ely, if I am not mi&s;taken, is of the like &s;entiment.&mdash;Now, with us, the contrary of this is demon&s;trated by the mo&s;t ob|vious facts.</P>
<P>In a climate where the di&s;ea&s;e is not epidemical, and where it is not generated, we are under advan|tages to decide, with much more certainty, in re&s;pect to its infectious nature, than we &s;hould be in a hot climate; where the long-continued heat, in conjunc|tion with a number of other cau&s;es, is productive of the di&s;order, and where it would, therefore, be very difficult to determine when the Fever was con&s;titu|tional, and when propagated by contagion.</P>
<P>We have never, in this part of the country (except in a &s;ingle in&s;tance in the year 1743, mentioned in the preceding letter) been acquainted with a Fever altogether &s;imilar to the one in que&s;tion. True, &s;ome chronic complaints in the vi&s;cera, as well as acute &s;poradic fevers, ending in &s;phacelation, have been attended with the vomiting of a fluid, putting on the appearance of coffee-grounds, and terminated in a black vomit. We have often &s;een continual en|demial fevers, intermittent, and remittent bilious fevers, originating from the putrid gates of animals and vegetables commixed,&mdash;as from draining of ponds and &s;tagnant waters:&mdash;but no di&s;ea&s;e from the&s;e &s;ources, or any in our climate, I conceive, ever compared with what is generally known by the name of the Yellow Fever&mdash;no di&s;ea&s;e attended with &s;o great rapidity, or characterized by that deep-&s;haded, univer&s;al yellowne&s;s, and vomiting of black-colored matter&mdash;oozing from the &s;urface of the &s;tomach.</P>
<P><PB N="192" REF="031593_0203_0FED529CA65B65A0">Dr. Ferrier ob&s;erves, that pe&s;tilential di&s;orders are not to be a&s;cribed to animal putridity. In&s;tances have been adduced in which thou&s;ands of dead bo|dies, have been left to putrify on fields of battle, without producing pe&s;tilential fever; nor have fevers been ob&s;erved to originate, or to rage more &s;everely, in hou&s;es &s;urrounding Church-yards; though the &s;tench is often in&s;ufferably offen&s;ive.

<HEAD>LETTER, OF DR. REYNOLDS, TO THE PUBLISHER.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM happy to hear that you purpo&s;e collect|ing a hi&s;tory of the Epidemic Bilious Fever that has of late made &s;uch ravage in &s;everal places in Ame|rica. By thus placing within &s;o &s;mall a compa&s;s, the practical experience of tho&s;e who have had an op|portunity of treating and being acquainted with that di&s;ea&s;e, much u&s;eful knowledge of the &s;ubject may be di&s;&s;eminated, and the general good of mankind pro|moted.</P>
<P>To aid this undertaking, I &s;end you the following, which if you think worthy of notice, will find a place in your collection.</P>
<P>For the fall and winter of the year 1792, and in the &s;ummer following, an Epidemic Bilious Fever, appeared with much violence in the town of New-Galway.</P>
<P>In general the fir&s;t attack was not &s;evere&mdash;for one or two of the fir&s;t days, the patient might rather be &s;aid to be unwell, than &s;ick.&mdash;But this &s;tate continued not long&mdash;&s;oon a violent fever, with &s;evere pains in various parts of the body, commenced&mdash;very fre|quently a nau&s;ea and vomiting, and &s;ometimes a vio|lent purging, were early companions of this di&s;ea&s;e. In patients of a delicate con&s;titution, the pul&s;e was
<PB N="196" REF="031593_0206_0FED52A7B12417E8">
&s;mall and quick from the beginning; but in others of a more robu&s;t habit, the pul&s;e was full and in &s;ome ca&s;es very regular, although the other &s;ymp|toms were much aggravated.&mdash;They &s;eldom com|plained of much thir&s;t after four or five days, al|though the mouth and tongue were dry and foul.&mdash; Mo&s;t of tho&s;e ca&s;es that proved fatal continued till after the twelfth day, and many till the twentieth from the on&s;et of the di&s;order.</P>
<P>In &s;ome few ca&s;es at the beginning of the di&s;ea&s;e, bleeding appeared to give &s;ome relief. But in mo&s;t of the in&s;tances where I had an opportunity of ob|&s;erving its effect, it was evidently hurtful.&mdash;The &s;ame I can te&s;tify with re&s;pect to frequent purging.</P>
<P>My general mode of treating this di&s;ea&s;e, I pub|li&s;hed in the Albany Regi&s;ter (a copy of which I &s;end inclo&s;ed)&mdash;And I have &s;ince frequently had the &s;ati&s;|faction to hear from gentlemen of the faculty, that my mercurial method had proved remarkably bene|ficial within their experience.&mdash;'Tis not within my power to trace the origin of this di&s;ea&s;e, in this place, to any known cau&s;e. The country has been im|proved about ten years, and previous to this, and &s;ince, has been remarkably healthy, except a &s;mall number of ca&s;es of the Maligna Angina, which not only occurred in this, but in all the neighboring towns, where nothing of the Bilious Fever followed. It began late in the &s;ummer, and continued till the the next &s;pring. It was expected that the winter would check its malignancy; but on the contrary, many of the wor&s;t ca&s;es happened in December.</P>
<P>In the &s;ummer following, a very extraordinary ca&s;e happened. Upon the border of a mar&s;hy piece of land, a hor&s;e died, and was &s;uffered to remain above
<PB N="197" REF="031593_0207_0FED52AA96384738">
ground and putrify. A young woman who lived near the place having frequent occa&s;ion to pa&s;s near the carca&s;e, was &s;eized with a violent pain in her head and &s;ickne&s;s at the &s;tomach. On the &s;econd day from the attack, a phy&s;ician was called, who let blood from the arm; but her fever increa&s;ed, and &s;he &s;oon became delirious. On the third day when I fir&s;t &s;aw her, every &s;ymptom appeared fatal. Upon her feet and hands, fingers and toes, a number of bli&s;ters, &s;ur|rounded by inflammation, appeared&mdash;and a real mor|tification had already begun upon the ends of &s;ome of her toes&mdash;The bli&s;ters and places of mortification continued to increa&s;e till the morning of the fourth day, when &s;he died.</P>
<P>The fatality attending this ca&s;e, will &s;hew the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of burying all animals that may die in the &s;um|mer &s;ea&s;on near any habitation. A precaution little attended to in the country.</P>

<HEAD>The following is the Paper mentioned in the foregoing Letter. FOR THE ALBANY REGISTER.</HEAD>
<P>THE method recommended by Dr. Ru&s;h of treating the contagious Fever now &s;o prevalent in Philadelphia, is by &s;ome phy&s;icians objected to, be|treating the Contagious Fever now &s;o prevalent in cau&s;e &s;o &s;imple; by others, from an idea that mercury can never be advantageou&s;ly u&s;ed in fevers, e&s;pecially in tho&s;e of a putrid kind. Fully convinced that tho&s;e objections are made either from prejudice or mi&s;taken theory, I view it an obligation incumbent on me to bear this public te&s;timony in favor of this new mode of treating putrid fevers.</P>
<P>In the neighborhood of New-Galway, for &s;everal months pa&s;t, an Epidemic Fever, attended with the &s;ame &s;ymptoms as that in Philadelphia, has raged to an alarming degree, and many have fallen victims to its fury.&mdash;To a number of tho&s;e ca&s;es I have been called, and have treated them in the following man|ner, with the happie&s;t &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t or inflammatory &s;tage of the di&s;ea&s;e, I gave calomel from 20 to 30 grains, &s;ufficient to prove cathartic, with a moderate opiate after the operation. The next day, and during the continuance of the fever, gave 2 grains of calomel, morning, noon, and night, and opiates occa&s;ionally&mdash;giving frequently an infu&s;ion of Rad. Serpent. Virg. in water; at the &s;ame time ordering that wine or lemonade be mixed in all their drinks. This method pur&s;ued in the early &s;tage of the di&s;order, a copious &s;weat will en&s;ue, and the patient &s;oon recover. If this happy time for relief is neglected, the fever puts on the highe&s;t &s;ymptoms of putrefaction, and often terminates in death.&mdash;I ought to mention that the &s;ymptoms attending tho&s;e
<PB N="199" REF="031593_0209_0FED52B02A08C9B8">
ca&s;es that I have &s;een, have not been &s;o violent or &s;ud|denly fatal as it is &s;aid of that in Philadelphia&mdash;owing, probably, to a difference in the climate.</P>
<P>Let tho&s;e who condemn this practice, con&s;ider that the Materia Medica furni&s;hes nothing that will &s;o ef|fectually open all the &s;ecretions at once, as Mercury. From thence I think this conclu&s;ion is ea&s;y, that nothing will &s;o &s;peedily di&s;charge from the circulation whatever matter may happen to be pre&s;ent, as this Divine Medicine.</P>
<P>That the art of phy&s;ic may &s;o improve, that old age &s;hall be the only weapon u&s;ed by death, is the</P>

<HEAD>REMARKS ON CERTAIN CAUSES OF DISEASE IN LARGE CITIES, AND THE MEANS OF PREVENTING THEM. WRITTEN IN DECEMBER, 1795.</HEAD>
<P>THE prevalence of the bilious remitting Yel|low Fever, in this and the neighboring States, for a few years pa&s;t, and its fatal effects, in many of the large towns, render an inve&s;tigation into the cau&s;es that have produced it, highly intere&s;ting to the citi|zens of the United States, and e&s;pecially of the mer|cantile towns.</P>
<P>The que&s;tion whether the Epidemic, which has proved de&s;tructive in Philadelphia, New-York, New-Haven, Baltimore and Norfolk, was the offspring of local cau&s;es in our own country, or of imported in|fection, has been much agitated, and to this moment, well-informed men are divided in opinion on the &s;ub|ject.</P>
<P>Without giving any opinion at pre&s;ent on this point, one thing may &s;afely be averred, that, whether imported, or generated by local cau&s;es in our own country, the epidemic influence and de&s;tructive ef|fects of this malignant bilious fever, are greatly in|crea&s;ed by local cau&s;es, which are wholly within the command of human power. It can be demon&s;trated to the &s;atisfaction of all rational, candid men, that whatever be the origin of the di&s;ea&s;e, a great proportion of its deleterious effects, is to be fairly a&s;cribed to the
<PB N="202" REF="031593_0211_0FED52B6797A9D68">
negligence of men. This point mu&s;t be admitted; for it can be proved by a &s;eries of deci&s;ive facts in this city; and I am informed al&s;o, by facts in Phila|delphia, Baltimore, Norfolk and New-Haven. This circum&s;tance le&s;&s;ens very much the importance of deciding the que&s;tion, whether imported or not; for if imported, it does not &s;pread, unle&s;s its progre&s;s is favored by unwhole&s;ome air in this country.</P>
<P>My main de&s;ign is to per&s;uade my fellow-citizens, that the general health of this metropolis depends greatly on their own exertions; and that although human power cannot guard again&s;t every in&s;tance of di&s;ea&s;e, yet it may prevent, in all ca&s;es, a di&s;ea&s;e pro|pagated by contagion, from &s;preading &s;o as to become a general calamity in a populous city. To enforce a conviction of this kind, I &s;hall produce only the evi|dence of inconte&s;tible facts or acknowledged truths, and the conclu&s;ions fairly deducible from them.</P>
<P>Di&s;ea&s;es, for my purpo&s;e, &s;hall be divided in the following kinds.</P>
<P N="1">I. Tho&s;e which are neither contagious nor epide|mic, but generated in particular per&s;ons by local and temporary cau&s;es, as the peripneumony and pleuri&s;y.</P>
<P N="2">II. Tho&s;e which are propagated &s;olely by conta|gion, as the &s;mall-pox.</P>
<P N="3">III. Tho&s;e which are epidemic and are not ordi|narily communicated by infection, as common colds, and the intermittent fever.</P>
<P N="4">IV. Tho&s;e which may be both epidemic and con|tagious; as the Dy&s;entery, Scarlet Fever, Yellow Fever, &amp;c.</P>
<P><PB N="203" REF="031593_0212_0FED52B95E093580">The fir&s;t cla&s;s, depending mo&s;tly on accident, or the negligence or vices of individuals, are not the ob|jects of my pre&s;ent inquiries.</P>
<P>The &s;econd are for the mo&s;t part ea&s;ily avoided by preventing a communication with the di&s;ea&s;ed. Some remarks that will hereafter occur may be applicable to ca&s;es of this kind.</P>
<P>The third cla&s;s are for the mo&s;t part out of the reach of public regulations. Individual precaution may do much to prevent or mitigate epidemics; but this is foreign to my pre&s;ent &s;ubject.</P>
<P>The fourth cla&s;s of di&s;ea&s;es are more or le&s;s under the controul of human regulations, according as they depend more or le&s;s for propagation on an epidemic imperceptible influence, or on contagion by means of a communication with the &s;ick. The influenza which appeared in 1789 and 1790, was &s;aid to be contagious; but if this was true, the di&s;ea&s;e could not have &s;pread by communication with the di&s;ea&s;ed; for hundreds and thou&s;ands of per&s;ons were &s;eized in a day, without any intercour&s;e with each other.&mdash; Its propagation therefore mu&s;t have been by means of invi&s;ible cau&s;es exi&s;ting in the atmo&s;phere.</P>
<P>What then are the cau&s;es of epidemic di&s;ea&s;es of the pe&s;tilential kind?</P>
<P>It is evident there are two principal &s;ources of di&s;|ea&s;e.&mdash;The fir&s;t is the air we breathe&mdash;The &s;econd, our food and drink. The&s;e cau&s;es may, and often do, act &s;eparately; and not unfrequently they act jointly in producing di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>Irregularities in diet and the u&s;e of improper food are things that depend mo&s;tly on the will of indivi|duals;
<PB N="204" REF="031593_0213_0FED52BC092C1D30">
and if they produce le&s;s di&s;ea&s;e at one time than another, it is becau&s;e the &s;ea&s;on is more or le&s;s favorable. The object of my pre&s;ent inquiries, is principally to explain the other great &s;ource of pe&s;ti|lential di&s;ea&s;es, <HI>impure air;</HI> to demon&s;trate how much it is in our power to prevent it exi&s;tence or le&s;&s;en its effects, e&s;pecially in populous cities; and hence to enfore the nece&s;&s;ity of a total and thorough reform in our police.</P>
<P>It is fact that is evident to all the world, that the natural &s;tate of air, unmixed with any &s;ub&s;tances ex|haled from our earth, is the mo&s;t fit for re&s;piration and perfectly &s;alubrious. Atmo&s;pheric air, even in its pure&s;t &s;tate, is found to be a compound fluid.&mdash; The parts, when &s;eparated by chymical proce&s;s, are unfit for re&s;piration, and a portion may be extracted from the pure&s;t air, which is in&s;tantly fatal to the life of animals. Chymi&s;ts &s;uppo&s;e they have a&s;certained the proportion of the parts of good and bad air, which exi&s;ts in the natural &s;tate of the atmo&s;phere<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See an ingenious little treati&s;e on Contagion, lately pub|li&s;hed by Dr. S. L. Mitchill; in which, notwith&s;tanding the technical terms employed, a common reader may find much in|&s;truction.</NOTE>. This is not material to my purpo&s;e. It is &s;ufficient for the purpo&s;es of common utility, to know that air is &s;alubrious when it is pure; that is, in its natural &s;tate, unmixed with effluvia from the &s;urface of the earth&mdash;and on the other hand, that the air is un|whole&s;ome and unfavorable to life, in proportion as it is impregnated with morbid exhalations from the earth.</P>
<P>The morbid exhalations which affect the air, pro|ceed mo&s;tly from fermenting animal and vegeta|ble &s;ub&s;tances. In what proportion the&s;e &s;ub&s;tances
<PB N="205" REF="031593_0214_0FED52BDBB23A9E8">
produce &s;uch noxious effluvia, is not material; as it is a given point that both may produce them. That &s;tate of animal and vegetable &s;ub&s;tance which &s;eems to generate the poi&s;onous air in greate&s;t quantities and with mo&s;t rapidity, is the &s;tate of <HI>putrefaction;</HI> which is the natural proce&s;s by which &s;uch &s;ub&s;tanees are decompounded and re&s;olved into their original component parts.</P>
<P>Putrefaction is carried on by air, heat and moi&s;|ture. Without air, all action cea&s;es in the animal and vegetable world; and the greater the heat and moi&s;ture to which &s;uch &s;ub&s;tances are expo&s;ed, the more rapid will be the proce&s;s of putrefaction.</P>
<P>As all animal and vegetable &s;ub&s;tances contain a quantity of noxious matter; and as they mu&s;t be continually decaying and putrefying, in greater or le&s;s quantities, on the &s;urface of the earth; and as they nece&s;&s;arily di&s;charge, during this proce&s;s, a poi|&s;onous effluvia into the atmo&s;phere; it becomes a &s;e|rious que&s;tion, e&s;pecially for the inhabitants of large towns, and in the neighborhood of exten&s;ive mar&s;hes, by what means they can avoid the inconve|niences and fatal effects of &s;uch an atmo&s;phere. Let us then attend to the following con&s;iderations.</P>
<P>The exhalations of a deleterious kind, like the ef|fluvia of all other kinds, proceed from certain objects as from the centre of a circle; and if not forced from their direction by winds, probably diverge in &s;traight lines. Near the objects from which they proceed, they are in their mo&s;t den&s;e or concentrated &s;tate; and as the objects u&s;ually lye on or near the earth, the air near the earth mu&s;t be impregnated with the greate&s;t quantity of this morbid matter. Perhaps al&s;o the &s;pecific gravity of this foul air may be
<PB N="206" REF="031593_0215_0FED52C0D709F6E8">
greater, than of pure air. But it is probable that it is capable of ri&s;ing and diffu&s;ing it&s;elf in the atmo&s;|phere; and that it becomes attenuated by occupying a larger &s;pace in the common air, until it is tho|roughly incorporated. In this manner, it is mo&s;t dangerous, becau&s;e mo&s;t concentrated near the earth; and at a di&s;tance, is more harmle&s;s.</P>
<P>The means of avoiding the injurious effects of the&s;e exhalations are various.</P>
<P N="1">I. By removing the animal or vegetable &s;ub|&s;tances, which generate noxious air. This is an arti|cle of infinite con&s;equence to cities.</P>
<P N="2">II. When the &s;ources of poi&s;on cannot be re|moved, as with re&s;pect to large mar&s;hes which can|not be drained, the obvious method of avoiding the ill effects, is to avoid, as much as po&s;&s;ible, breathing the air in the neighborhood. Farmers would do well to &s;et their hou&s;es as far as is po&s;&s;ibly con&s;i&s;tent with their bu&s;ine&s;s, from &s;uch low grounds.</P>
<P N="3">III. When people nece&s;&s;arily live in places where large quantities of morbid effluvia u&s;ually impregnate the atmo&s;phere, ventilation of their &s;treets and hou&s;es is among the mo&s;t effectual means of preventing the concentration of the poi&s;on and its fatal con&s;e|quences.</P>
<P>So far as regards the police of a city, the whole doctrine of preventing or mitigating the injurious ef|fects of bad air, is comprehended in the following articles&mdash;to remove the &s;ources of the poi&s;on, or to di&s;&s;ipate it as much as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>To remove the &s;ources of the evil, infinite care &s;hould be taken in building cities, to leave no low
<PB N="207" REF="031593_0216_0FED52C4A16C0F90">
grounds or hollow places among the buildings, as receptacles of water and filth. The back yards &s;hould, in every ca&s;e, be rai&s;ed above the pavement of the &s;treets, and the &s;treets &s;hould be &s;o rai&s;ed, as to give a con&s;iderable de&s;cent into the adjoining river or &s;ea. No trouble or expen&s;e will ju&s;tify a neglect of this regulation. The health and the lives of citi|zens ab&s;olutely depend on this precaution. If the land in the rear of the building lots is naturally lower than in front, it &s;hould be rai&s;ed by carting in earth. It &s;hould be an article of the police of every city, that no man &s;hould erect a hou&s;e, without at the &s;ame time, rai&s;ing the back yard, to give a de&s;cent in|to the &s;treet. The yard &s;hould al&s;o be paved, if a|mong other buildings in a compact part of the city; and no filthy water from the hou&s;e &s;hould be &s;uffered to lodge in back yards. People &s;hould learn that it is not large piles of animal or vegetable &s;ub&s;tances alone, that generate foul air; but every &s;mall &s;ub|&s;tance, and all the water that has been u&s;ed in a fa|mily, add to the &s;ources of this evil. Water it&s;elf may be ab&s;orbed in the earth or evaporate; but any filthy &s;ub&s;tance it may contain, lodges on the &s;urface of the earth, expo&s;ed to the action of the &s;un, and furni&s;hes a portion of poi&s;onous effluvia. Hence in cities, &s;mooth pavements, though they may augment the heat of the air in &s;ome &s;mall degree, contribute not a little to pre&s;erve a pure air, by facilitating cleanline&s;s. And it is a remarkable fact that the in|habitants of the &s;uburbs or &s;kirts of many of the large towns in America, who live beyond the pave|ments, are much more &s;ubject to the common au|tumnal complaints, than tho&s;e who re&s;ide within the pavements.</P>
<P>Water is perhaps the be&s;t purifyer of the hou&s;es and &s;treets of cities, as well as of infected clothes.&mdash;
<PB N="208" REF="031593_0217_0FED52C74EEB1398">
The u&s;e of water cannot be too liberal; but care &s;hould be taken that none of it remains to &s;tagnate about or near buildings. Water imbibes the poi&s;on of foul &s;ub&s;tances, and therefore when hou&s;es, back yards and &s;treets are wa&s;hed, the water &s;hould be enabled, by &s;uitable channels, to run off into the &s;ewers or adjoining river. If the natural &s;urface of the earth is too level for this, no pains &s;hould be &s;pared to remedy this inconvenience by artificial ele|vations. It is no excu&s;e for neglecting the&s;e things, to &s;ay they are <HI>expen&s;ive;</HI> becau&s;e they cannot be &s;o expen&s;ive as <HI>epidemic di&s;ea&s;es.</HI> The lo&s;s of bu&s;ine&s;s for one &s;ea&s;on, in &s;uch a city as Philadelphia or New-York, would build all the &s;treets in this city, where the fever has been mo&s;t fatal<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Half a million of dollars is probably a low e&s;timate of the lo&s;s incurred by New-York the la&s;t &s;ea&s;on.</NOTE>. But when we take into con&s;ideration the lo&s;s of life, the tears, the di&s;|tre&s;&s;es of bereaved parents, and of helple&s;s widows and orphans&mdash;the idea of <HI>expen&s;e,</HI> for the purpo&s;e of preventing &s;uch calamities, lo&s;es all its terror.&mdash; Labor and per&s;everence will conquer all difficulties of this kind; and if all po&s;&s;ible means of rendering ci|ties healthy are not u&s;ed, why are they built at all? Why &s;hould cities be erected, if they are to be only the tombs of men? A frequent recurrence of malig|nant and fatal epidemics will be&s;ides le&s;&s;en the bu&s;i|ne&s;s of a town, and this &s;inks the value of real e&s;tate. It is therefore the proprietor's <HI>intere&s;t</HI> as well as his <HI>duty</HI> to attend to every circum&s;tance that can in&s;ure the health of his tenants.</P>
<P>But as among a multitude of people, the artificial cau&s;es of di&s;ea&s;e mu&s;t be numerous, and much dirt and filth will be found, to produce impure air, what|ever pains are taken to pre&s;erve cleanline&s;s; it be|comes

As water ab&s;orbs the poi&s;on of filth or wa&s;hes it away; &s;o wind di&s;&s;ipates the morbid effluvia, and renders it altoge|ther harmle&s;s: or at lea&s;t diffu&s;es it &s;o as to le&s;&s;en its action upon the &s;y&s;tem. If we examine the progre&s;s of the late fever in this city, we &s;hall find its ravages in a direct proportion to the want of cleanline&s;s and ventilation in the &s;everal &s;treets and hou&s;es.</P>
<P>To know how much depends on a free air in the cure of fevers, mo&s;t per&s;ons need only to attend to the facts within their ob&s;ervation. But this is a circum|&s;tance of &s;o much importance to a city, that it de|&s;erves particular con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>Air, as well as water, is a fluid, which, by the laws of nature, is kept in almo&s;t continual agitation. Its natural &s;tate, as before ob&s;erved, is perfectly &s;alu|brious; that is, fitted for the purpo&s;e of pre&s;erving life and health. Whatever poi&s;onous qualities it may contain, it receives them from &s;ub&s;tances within the hu|man body, or on the &s;urface of the earth. But it is a law of fluids to purify them&s;elves by motion. Thus whatever impure qualities the air may receive from putrifying &s;ub&s;tances, and which may be rai&s;ed by heat and float in a &s;tagnant air, may, by violent agi|tation, either be &s;o attenuated or diffu&s;ed, or &s;o inti|mately combined with other parts of the air, as to be rendered totally harmle&s;s. Whatever therefore tends to ob&s;truct the motion of the air near the earth; that region of air which men con&s;tantly breathe; re|&s;trains, in a greater or le&s;s degree, the natural ten|dency of the air to purify it&s;elf. Hence the infinite importance of attending to the means of giving a free current of air through hou&s;es and the &s;treets of a po|pulous city.</P>
<P><PB N="210" REF="031593_0219_0FED52CC6E891600">The &s;treets of a city &s;hould, if po&s;&s;ible, be &s;trait.&mdash; The &s;tale notion of cen&s;uring uniformity in a city, is worthy only of weak minds. Crooked or winding &s;treets tend to break the force of the wind; as with a &s;tream of water, which is retarded at every bend. This article however is not of the fir&s;t con&s;equence.</P>
<P>It has been doubted whether wide &s;treets in a large town are very beneficial; as the action of the &s;un on the pavement is violent, and the heat is increa&s;ed, and as the quantity of &s;hade is le&s;s in proportion in wide &s;treets than in narrow ones. But wide &s;treets, if kept clean, are doubtle&s;s the mo&s;t healthy, as they ad|mit a larger quantity of pure air, and a more free cir|culation.</P>
<P>Another article in the laying out of &s;treets for healthine&s;s, is, a &s;uitable elevation of the parts di&s;tant from the &s;ewers or river, to give a de&s;cent for the water to run off with &s;ome force and rapidity. A moderate elevation is not &s;ufficient; for though, in &s;uch a ca&s;e, the water it&s;elf may drain off &s;lowly, yet it leaves mo&s;t of the filth behind, which is the &s;ource of poi&s;on to the inhabitants. In this particular, Front-&s;treet and Water-&s;treet, in this city, are very ill con&s;tructed. The natural po&s;ition of tho&s;e &s;treets, which are made along the &s;hore of the Ea&s;t River, is nearly on a level. It was the bu&s;ine&s;s of the police to remedy this, in the mode of pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing.</P>
<P>Two obvious modes of preventing the inconveni|ences of level ground, &s;ugge&s;t them&s;elves. Fir&s;t to rai&s;e the middle of the &s;treet, then to give the whole a more round or &s;pherical form, than is nece&s;&s;ary on a declivity. Where a con&s;iderable declivity occurs, the water will run off with force, whatever be the form of the pavement. But on a level, &s;ome artifi|cial elevation mu&s;t be contrived. On a declivity, the
<PB N="211" REF="031593_0220_0FED52D0F4BCBB80">
form of the pavement &s;hould be the &s;ection of a large circle&mdash;on level ground, the &s;ection of a &s;mall circle, is a better form.</P>
<P>The &s;econd improvement in making &s;treets on le|vel ground, is to rai&s;e the land in the centre, between two gutters or &s;ewers. Thus for in&s;tance Water-&s;treet, between Pine-&s;treet and the Fly-market, &s;hould be rai&s;ed much higher than at pre&s;ent, in the central point between the two &s;treets. The inconvenience of an elevation of two or three feet in &s;uch a di&s;tance, is trifling, when put in competition with cleanline&s;s.</P>
<P>Perhaps al&s;o &s;mooth gutters along the &s;ides of the &s;treets, next the foot walk, might be made of hewn &s;tone, and &s;o laid as to be durable. This would amazingly facilitate the cleaning of &s;treets which are nearly level.</P>
<P>Another article in con&s;tructing a city for health, is, that as few &s;treets as po&s;&s;ible &s;hould terminate within the city; that is, inclo&s;ed, at the ends as well as &s;ides, by ranges of buildings. Wherever a &s;treet terminates by a block of hou&s;es, the circulation of air is ob&s;tructed. Violent winds indeed penetrate into every place; but mo&s;t of our &s;ummer winds are light, and in the &s;ultry &s;ea&s;on, which ventilation is mo&s;t wanted, becau&s;e the exhalations of a noxious quality are mo&s;t con&s;iderable, there is very little wind in the open country; and in the confined &s;treets of a city, none at all.</P>
<P>Lumber-&s;treet, is an example of a &s;treet terminated by three &s;tory buildings in Liberty-&s;treet. There are many others of the &s;ame kind, and &s;ome with no di|rect opening to either river, as Garden-&s;treet and Batavia-&s;treet. This circum&s;tance makes no &s;mall
<PB N="212" REF="031593_0221_0FED52D3D79B4A08">
difference in the free circulation, and con&s;equently in the purity of the air<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Let a dam be erected five feet high, acro&s;s a &s;tream of ten feet depth. This dam would check the current near the bottom of the river, for a con&s;iderable di&s;tance. The &s;ame is true of air, in a le&s;s degree.</P><P>Every per&s;on has ob&s;erved the effect of friction in retarding the current of a river. The current near the &s;ides and bottom is &s;lower than in the middle; by means of the friction of the water again&s;t the earth. A remarkable proof of this is, that the tide in rivers flows and rai&s;es the water 6 or 8 inches, before the ebb cur|rent has done running on the &s;urface of the water. The flood tide meets with le&s;s re&s;i&s;tance from the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">low under current, than from the rapid current above&mdash;it checks the under current fir&s;t, and thus rai&s;es the water, while the ebb current on the &s;urface is yet running.</P></NOTE>.</P>
<P>In the con&s;truction of dwelling hou&s;es, equal at|tention is required to the form and po&s;ition, in order to promote ventilation. Under ground &s;tories for the habitation of families, it would be well to prohibit altogether. As work-&s;hops they are le&s;s pernicious; but are generally unfavorable to health. In &s;ome ca&s;es, rooms partly below ground are &s;o &s;itu|ated, as to admit a current of air through them. In &s;uch ca&s;es, they may be occupied with more &s;afety.</P>
<P>The circum&s;tance of admitting fre&s;h air through rooms by oppo&s;ite corre&s;ponding windows or doors, is one that ought never to be neglected, in low &s;itu|ations and crouded places. The difference in the circulation of air, is immen&s;e, when the air can pa&s;s through a room in a direct line. Side doors and windows do not effectually an&s;wer the purpo&s;e; and when there is no opening into a room, but on one &s;ide, there can be very little circulation. It might be well worth the attention of people who build hou&s;es, to con&s;ider whether it would not favor health
<PB N="213" REF="031593_0222_0FED52D594F445E8">
materially, to con&s;truct doors or windows between the front and back rooms of their hou&s;es, in &s;uch a manner, that they might be u&s;ed in &s;ummer, but clo&s;ed and concealed in winter. In many &s;ituations, this arrangement would prove highly agreeable, and contribute greatly to health.</P>
<P>If the foregoing principles are ju&s;t, it is worthy of our attention to compare the actual &s;ituation of New-York, as it relates to the means of pre&s;erving health, <HI>cleanline&s;s</HI> and <HI>ventiliation.</HI></P>
<P>The natural &s;ituation of a great part of this city, is as well calculated for &s;alubrity of air, as it is po&s;&s;i|ble to conceive one to be. The form of the I&s;land is adapted for cleanline&s;s in a remarkable manner; the land gradually ri&s;ing from each river, the filth is, by every rain, wa&s;hed down the declivity on each &s;ide towards the river, and where it is not ob&s;tructed in its pa&s;&s;age, by &s;ome artificial means, is carried into the water and &s;wept away by the tides. The city is open on the &s;outh we&s;t point to refre&s;hing breezes from the bay; and the re&s;triction which prevents the corporation or citizens from ever converting the walk at what is called the <HI>battery,</HI> into &s;treets and hou&s;e lots to be inclo&s;ed and covered with buildings, has in&s;ured the lives and health of thou&s;ands of citi|izens. Fre&s;h air enters Broad-way, Greenwich-&s;treet, Broad-&s;treet, &amp;c. and penetrates freely into the city; ventilating tho&s;e &s;pacious &s;treets and di&s;&s;i|pating the noxious air nece&s;&s;arily generated in a large town. On the we&s;t, the &s;treets which cro&s;s the I&s;l|and, are open to fre&s;h air, from the Hud&s;on, and the &s;traight direction and the breadth of tho&s;e &s;treets, con&s;pire with the declivity of the ground, to give all that part of the city, the advantage of ventilation and cleanline&s;s,</P>
<P><PB N="214" REF="031593_0223_0FED52D843404E50">On the ea&s;t &s;ide of the I&s;land, the declivity of the ground is favorable to cleanline&s;s, from the height of the land to Pearl-&s;treet, the la&s;t &s;treet erected on the natural earth. Water-&s;treet and Front-&s;treet are built on <HI>made land</HI>&mdash;the water every tide penetrates, by &s;ubterraneous pa&s;&s;ages, to the cellars in Water-&s;treet, and what is perhaps wor&s;e, the &s;treets are &s;o level, that not only the filth made on them, but great part of what is brought down from the higher land in John-&s;treet, Maiden-lane, Pine-&s;treet and Wall-&s;treet, lodges upon the pavements or in the &s;ewers. In paving and building on this <HI>made land,</HI> no effectual provi&s;ion was adopted to carry off the water and filth; and the inhabitants &s;everely feel the con&s;equences of that neglect.</P>
<P>Here then we find, if not in all ca&s;es the &s;ources, yet the peculiar region, of fatal maladies. Here di&s;|ea&s;es of a malignant kind in hot weather fir&s;t appear, and from &s;ome point, take their departure and &s;pread de&s;olation.</P>
<P>If we proceed further northward, we &s;hall find, in what was called the Swamp, a &s;till more fatal neglect of the means of pre&s;erving health. The ground now covered by Roo&s;evelt-&s;treet, James-&s;treet and Catherine-&s;treet, extending from the Ea&s;t River towards the Tea-water Pump, was a few years ago covered with a pond of water. The ground is arti|ficial; and not only &s;o, when the &s;treets, a few years ago, were paved, they were rai&s;ed from two to four feet above the foundation of the original hou&s;es. The back yards are few of them paved, and being lower than the &s;treets, they are the re&s;ervoirs of every &s;pecies of filth.</P>
<P><PB N="215" REF="031593_0224_0FED52DB6AD74CE8">So far as regards &s;alubrity, this part of the city is mo&s;t unfortunate; indeed it is &s;carcely po&s;&s;ible to conceive of a &s;ituation wor&s;e calculated for pre&s;erv|ing the lives of the inhabitants.</P>
<P>The <HI>natural</HI> &s;ituation of this quarter of the city is not favorable for cleanline&s;s and ventilation. A &s;traight line from the Battery to Corlaer's hook would pa&s;s by Beekman's-&s;lip, Peck-&s;lip, New-&s;lip, &amp;c. at &s;everal hundred feet di&s;tance; the &s;hore being a curve. By this means, the part of the city forming this curve, is &s;hielded from the direct cour&s;e of the we&s;terly winds, the mo&s;t &s;alubrious that blow on this continent and which prevail nine months in the year. On the north we&s;t, the higher ground and buildings prevent the direct acce&s;s of the wind; &s;o that that part of the city, which is the olde&s;t, be&s;t-&s;ettled, and where filth is mo&s;t apt to collect, has the lea&s;t ad|vantage of free air. The direct cour&s;e of the wind being broken by the higher ground on the north we&s;t and the &s;outhern point of the i&s;land, the pure air from tho&s;e points &s;eldom blows with violence along the ea&s;tern &s;hore, and the light breezes of &s;ummer, in&s;tead of &s;weeping currents, afford little more than gentle eddies that are in&s;ufficient to pu|rify the atmo&s;phere which the citizens breathe.</P>
<P>The high ground in the rear of the &s;hip-yards and above George-&s;treet are very injurious, in prevent|ing ventilation. The land is nearly on a level with the chimnies of the hou&s;es from George-&s;treet to Roo&s;evelt-&s;treet. This breaks the current of air in almo&s;t every direction; for it has been before ob|&s;erved, that the under current of air is checked by objects to the height of tho&s;e objects.</P>
<P><PB N="216" REF="031593_0225_0FED52E083606528">Tho&s;e natural di&s;advantages of &s;ituation are not remedied by the mode of building and paving the &s;treets below. The &s;treets are nearly level; the back yards are unpaved and receive every &s;pecies of filth, which accumulates the whole year, and in &s;um|mer mu&s;t &s;upply a prodigious quantity of foul exha|lations. It is impo&s;&s;ible for the inhabitants of &s;uch &s;treets to be healthy in a hot &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>The ea&s;tern part of Water-&s;treet is in a &s;imilar &s;tate. The pavement is rai&s;ed above the fir&s;t floors of the buildings and above the ground between that &s;treet and Cherry-&s;treet. Of cour&s;e water and filth collect in the rear of the buildings and in the cellars. The wharfing is equally bad; &s;ome of the wharfs only half fini&s;hed admit the tide; but prevent the filth received from the &s;treets and hou&s;es, from being &s;wept away. This is the ca&s;e about the place where the fever appeared the &s;ummer pa&s;t. The wharfs &s;hould be made &s;olid and complete and well paved&mdash; &s;olid to admit of the lea&s;t po&s;&s;ible &s;ubterranean filth and &s;tagnant water, and well paved to carry off what is formed on the &s;urface.</P>
<P>Such are the facts relative to the &s;ituation of this city, as adapted to cleanline&s;s and ventilation. A great portion of the city is high, cleanly and well ventilated&mdash;but &s;ome parts are low, level, and dirty, and covered from we&s;terly winds. The former has invariably e&s;caped the ravages of epidemic bilious fevers, and the latter has repeatedly &s;uffered by their fatal effects. Let any candid man walk over the city, and examine the &s;ituation of each &s;treet, and he will find that the epidemic has been fatal, in a very exact proportion to the cau&s;es of di&s;ea&s;e which have been de&s;cribed.</P>
<P><PB N="217" REF="031593_0226_0FED52E39DA40728">Before I conclude this &s;ubject, I would make &s;ome remarks on the manner of con&s;tructing the common &s;ewers, as al&s;o the wharves and docks.</P>
<P>The principal &s;ewers in the city, &s;uch as tho&s;e in Broad-&s;treet, Fly-market and Burling-&s;lip, are built on ground, &s;ubject to a flux and reflux of tide. If the tide penetrates through them, it carries back the filth which is received from the &s;treets, and pre|vents it being &s;wept into the &s;ea, for 6 hours every flood. If any part of the fewer is above high water, a great portion of the filth will be met by the tide, and lodged; and, what is wor&s;e, if the &s;ewers are wholly above high water, and not wa&s;hed by the tides, and if they are nearly in a horizontal po&s;ition, great quantities of filthy putrefying &s;ub&s;tances will always be collected in them. In all the&s;e ca&s;es, a fetid air is generated and emitted from the&s;e re&s;er|voirs of impure matter.</P>
<P>The&s;e con&s;iderations &s;ugge&s;t the impropriety of all &s;ewers under ground, unle&s;s in places where tides or running water con&s;tantly wa&s;h them clean. If all the water of a city is drained off on the &s;urface of the earth, any collection of filth, by means of &s;udden &s;howers or other cau&s;es, is vi&s;ible, and may be ea&s;ily removed.</P>
<P>Never was a greater mi&s;take than con&s;tructing an arched &s;ewer under ground, in Fly-market. The land in Maiden-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ane is &s;o high, that it would have been very ea&s;y to conduct the water above ground into the dock; und nothing could have been more cleanly and &s;alutary, than to have had the market wa&s;hed by the copious &s;treams of water which are collected, every &s;hower, from William-&s;treet and Liberty-&s;treet, and united ju&s;t above the market. It &s;eems as if nature had contrived a &s;ituation in tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="218" REF="031593_0227_0FED52E556CF89E0">
&s;pot, for a clean whole&s;ome market, and that all the ingenuity of the corporation had been formerly ex|erci&s;ed, to defeat her beneficent intentions. So well adapted for this purpo&s;e have been the means u&s;ed, that the water is directed under ground, at the very point where it is mo&s;t wanted above ground. As all the water is thus carried off, and as the &s;treet is nearly level, all the filth of the dirtie&s;t place in the city, is left as a nui&s;ance to annoy half the inhabitants of the city, who are obliged to re&s;ort to that market.</P>
<P>As if this was not enough, a floor is made to the market, and &s;o loo&s;ely put together, as to &s;uffer filth and offal to get beneath the boards, where it is out of the reach of any &s;light attempts to &s;weep the mar|ket. This is an inexcu&s;eable fault&mdash;becau&s;e the ex|pen&s;e of removing the floor, and laying a &s;mooth brick pavement, which is ea&s;ily wa&s;hed and always firm, is too incon&s;iderable to be noticed. The cleanline&s;s of the Philadelphia market, which is thus paved, &s;hould have &s;ugge&s;ted this improvement, long before this time<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Since writing the above, this market is undergoing a ma|terial alteration.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Equally ill-con&s;tructed are the wharves. Docks, in which all manner of filth is collected, are left dry at low water, which never ought to be the ca&s;e. For although the water of the &s;ea, and pure earth covered with it, are not unwhole&s;ome, yet when mixed with other &s;ub&s;tances, the compound may prove highly noxious. It appears to me that the docks &s;hould be filled out &s;o far as that the earth &s;hould, at low water, be entirely covered. The wharves &s;hould be made as &s;olid as po&s;&s;ible, to pre|vent water from penetrating and &s;tagnating in them, or conveying into the interior &s;tructure of them, ve|getable
<PB N="219" REF="031593_0228_0FED52E85C15AAB0">
and animal &s;ub&s;tances which may lodge and putrefy. They &s;hould al&s;o be &s;o con&s;tructed on the top as to be ea&s;ily kept clean. The deep holes and miry places about our wharves in rainy weather, are as unhealthy in hot weather, as they are inconve|nient at all times. They are in many places &s;o nar|row, as to endanger the legs and lives of men among the carts, hog&s;heads and bow&s;prits, and in the hur|rying &s;ea&s;on of autumn, it is not too much to calcu|late that ten per cent. of the labor of men employed on them is lo&s;t by their interfering with each other.</P>
<P>What complete remedy can be &s;ugge&s;ted for the&s;e evils, I will not undertake to decide. It is a common concern, and among the citizens who are intere&s;ted in a general and thorough correction, &s;ome will be found to point out the principles.</P>
<P>It &s;eems obvious however, that a total &s;top &s;hould be put to extending the made-ground into the rivers. This artificial earth is always porous; it admits and retains water; of cour&s;e all cellars in &s;uch ground are damp and unwhole&s;ome. Perhaps it might be well to fill up the docks, and give the front of the &s;olid wharves a &s;trait direction&mdash;leaving no ground bare at low water; &s;o that every &s;ub&s;tance, wa&s;hed or &s;wept into the water, &s;hould be floated away.&mdash; The wharfing might be extended to any convenient di&s;tance into the rivers, by erecting piers, connected by bridges. It appears, however, proper, that all the wharves &s;hould be permitted to extend only equal di&s;tances&mdash;the &s;ame of the &s;tores on the wharves&mdash; they &s;hould pre&s;ent a uniform front. This would render them all more airy and healthy; and no man could ob&s;truct his neighbor's air or view; a matter of no &s;mall con&s;equence, as it regards plea&s;ure and health.</P>
<P><PB N="220" REF="031593_0229_0FED52EC29F539E8">It is a fact clearly a&s;certained, that the proce&s;s of vegetation contributes to the &s;alubrity of the air.&mdash; The more trees, gra&s;s-plots and flowers can be cul|tivated in a city, the more healthy. All broad &s;treets, will admit the growth of Trees, and the&s;e are as ornamental as they are u&s;eful.

<P>The more we examine the modes of living of an American and Frenchman, whether indi&s;po&s;ed or in good health, the more we per&s;i&s;t in our &s;y&s;tem, and in the idea that the American cannot totally pre&s;erve him&s;elf free from this raging fever, which commonly breaks out in hot weather, but by following another regimen directly oppo&s;ite to that which he has till now u&s;ed.</P>
<P>Although the American &s;eems commonly to enjoy the be&s;t health, though his high color announces the &s;tronge&s;t con&s;titution, yet we are much inclined to think that he would not run &s;o many ri&s;ks in the &s;ummer time, were he to live more &s;oberly during the other &s;ea&s;ons; were he to live upon more whole|&s;ome food; were he le&s;s fond of &s;trong liquors, tea, and green fruits, and would he make a frequent u&s;e of baths and lotions; which are as whole&s;ome for the inte&s;tines, as nece&s;&s;ary for exterior cleanline&s;s.</P>
<P>We will not follow the Americans through the paths of private life; but we &s;hall &s;ay that, in general, temperance is not ob&s;ervable among them, nor that moderation of which the French daily reap the ad|vantage; the latter reli&s;h Burgundy and old Bour|deaux wine, and &s;eldom allow them&s;elves to drink &s;pirituous liquors; while the former di&s;approve of Claret, as too weak, and prefer Madeira, Sherry, Port, Rum, and Gin, which mu&s;t, of cour&s;e, inflame
<PB N="222" REF="031593_0231_0FED52F0E18DCC48">
and throw the blood into a fermentation. Notwith|&s;tanding this, we &s;ee Americans, who &s;ay they have been advi&s;ed to u&s;e them, e&s;pecially during the di&s;or|der, in order to give tone to the &s;tomach.</P>
<P>The French never drink any tea, unle&s;s they feel their &s;tomach unea&s;y. In the morning and in the evening, the Americans &s;eem to <HI>&s;wim in tea,</HI> which is &s;o &s;trong, that an Engli&s;h tea pot would make as many as twen|ty, according to the French fa&s;hion. Should what has been &s;aid by &s;kilful and learned Doctors be true, that tea is one of the mo&s;t corro&s;ive vegetables, the juice or e&s;&s;ence of it mu&s;t of cour&s;e make a &s;low but &s;trong impre&s;&s;ion on the nerves, and occa&s;ion the di&s;&s;olution of the blood. It is likewi&s;e cu&s;tomary to eat with their tea, heavy cakes of all kinds, and toa&s;ts which are not reckoned to be good unle&s;s they are thickly covered with butter; which increa&s;es the bilious ma&s;s of humour.</P>
<P>We &s;hall not repeat the ob&s;ervations which we have heretofore made, upon the aver&s;ene&s;s the Amer|icans feel for &s;oup and re&s;torative broths, on their eating their meat running with blood, with &s;carcely any bread, and plenty of heavy potatoes, the only vegetables which are &s;een on their tables; whil&s;t the French always give the preference to vegetables, and e&s;pecially to tho&s;e which are light and whole&s;ome. But we cannot help ob&s;erving, that in the months of May, June and July, the &s;treets and markets were &s;een in the morning furni&s;hed with an immen&s;e quantity of fruits, the mo&s;t part of which are either green or unripe. In the evening all tho&s;e fruits have di&s;ap|peared and have been eaten; hence, bloody fluxes, dy&s;enteries and bad chyles, which unwhol&s;ome food mu&s;t undoubtedly produce.</P>
<P><PB N="223" REF="031593_0232_0FED52F5081F6050">As to baths, baths of cleanne&s;s, injections, &amp;c. there are few French, in the lea&s;t careful of their health, who do not make u&s;e of them.</P>
<P>The Americans, far from practi&s;ing tho&s;e u&s;eful and whole&s;ome tokens, look upon them as ridiculous and unbecoming.</P>
<P>It is no longer &s;urpri&s;ing that Americans, heedle&s;s of their health, living on unwhole&s;ome foods and drinking heating liquors, &s;hould prove &s;o little di&s;|po&s;ed to re&s;i&s;t the impre&s;&s;ion of &s;corching hot weather, which opens the pores, and occa&s;ions, if we may be allowed the expre&s;&s;ion, a continual <HI>depreda|tion</HI> on the vital principles, through a thou&s;and i&s;&s;ues, always open. It is not to be wondered that heat and dampne&s;s, which on this continent more rapidly &s;ucceed each other than in any other climate, &s;hould &s;oon bring into a &s;tate of fermentation, humors im|pregnated with &s;o many principles of putridity. Will any one wonder at &s;eeing the unfortunate &s;eized with the fever, fall &s;o &s;uddenly victims to it, when they are &s;een to &s;wallow remedies which, far from keeping down and cooling the fermentation, increa&s;e it; when they are &s;een undergoing copious bleed|ings, &s;toring in emetics, bark, Madeira, and other &s;pirits called tonical, producing in the body the &s;ame effects as oil or fire? Finally, we &s;ee when the&s;e unfortunate people are left by them&s;elves, de|&s;erted, and given up by their neare&s;t relation, whom a panic keeps as far from them as from per&s;ons in|fected with the plague, &s;orrow and de&s;pair, much more than the mo&s;t violent remedies with which they are treated, hurries them to an unavoidable death.</P>
<P>For the&s;e two years, the French have been no|ticing the&s;e &s;alutary ob&s;ervations to the Americans,

<HEAD>TO THE GENTLEMEN MEETING AT THE BRIDGEWATER ARMS.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AT the reque&s;t of &s;ome of your number, who ori|ginally propo&s;ed this meeting, I &s;ubmit to your con|&s;ideration a few remarks towards the formation of a Board, or Committee for &s;uperintending the health of the manufacturing poor in Manche&s;ter and Sal|ford. A principal object of this Committee, mu&s;t be that of dimini&s;hing the frequency of the Epidemic Fever, which has &s;o often alarmed us in this place, which is now very prevalent in &s;ome parts of the town, and has &s;pread it&s;elf to a very unu&s;ual extent in &s;ome of the neighboring towns. The circum|&s;tances which produce and propagate this di&s;ea&s;e, &s;eem to require more immediately the interference of a public body, and the&s;e once remedied, the general health of the poor mu&s;t be greatly improved. Hav|ing already publi&s;hed my &s;entiments pretty full on this &s;ubject; I &s;hall remark, without entering into any rea&s;oning, that the principal &s;ources of fever among our poor, are lodging-hou&s;es, cellars, cotton-mills, and the incautious intercour&s;e of the poor with each other, in places infected.</P>
<P N="1">1. Re&s;pecting lodging-hou&s;es, I have ob&s;erved el&s;e|where, that the mo&s;t de&s;irable means of prevention, would be to &s;ubject them to licen&s;es, which would bring them under the controul of the magi&s;trates.&mdash; At pre&s;ent, as the town is much le&s;s crouded than it was in 1792, the mi&s;chief ari&s;ing from the&s;e hou&s;es is le&s;s; and until the Committee can acquire the proper powers; it would perhaps be &s;ufficient to be at the expen&s;e of white-wa&s;hing &s;uch as &s;hall be re|ported to be infected and dirty, or where they are
<PB N="226" REF="031593_0235_0FED52FCF4019558">
found to be over-crouded, to prevail on &s;ome of the lodgers to remove, which may be readily done.</P>
<P N="2">2. The number of damp, and very ill-ventilated cellars, inhabited in many parts of the town, is a more exten&s;ive and permanent evil. It may be nece&s;&s;ary to explain to gentlemen who have not vi&s;ited &s;uch places; that they each con&s;i&s;t of two rooms under ground, the front apartment of which, u&s;ed as a kitchen, though frequently noxious by its dampne&s;s and clo&s;ene&s;s, is greatly preferable to the back room; the latter h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s only one &s;mall window, which though on a level with the outer ground, is near the roof of the cellar; it is often patched with boards or paper; and, in its be&s;t &s;tate, is &s;o much covered with mud, as to admit very little either of air or light. In this cell, the beds of the whole family, &s;ometimes con&s;i&s;t|ing of &s;even or eight, are placed. The floor of this room is often unpaved; the beds are fixed on the damp earth. But the floor, even when paved, is al|ways damp. In &s;uch places, where a candle is re|quired even at noon-day to examine the patient, I have &s;een the &s;ick without bed&s;teads, lying on rags; they can &s;eldom afford &s;traw.</P>
<P>This deplorable &s;tate of mi&s;ery becomes frequently the origin, and certainly &s;upports in a great degree the progre&s;s of infectious fevers. I have been able in many in&s;tances to trace the infection from cellar to cellar, and to &s;ay where it might have been &s;topped by prudent management on the part of the infected family. But it is likewi&s;e very difficult to eradicate the fever, when it &s;eizes a family thus &s;itu|ated. It generally attacks them all in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, and the convale&s;cents, from their con&s;inement in the mid&s;t of infection, have frequent relap&s;es, attend|ed with increa&s;ing danger, &s;o that the di&s;ea&s;e conti|nues
<PB N="227" REF="031593_0236_0FED53018A1EAAF0">
in the &s;ame &s;pot for &s;everal months together.&mdash; The recovery even of tho&s;e who do not relap&s;e, is al&s;o tedious and imperfect, beyond the conception of any who have not experienced ca&s;es of this nature. The want of proper nur&s;es mu&s;t be added as none of the lea&s;t evils attending this unfortunate cla&s;s of people. I have no he&s;itation in a&s;&s;erting that many lives are annually lo&s;t, from this cau&s;e alone. It is extremely difficult at pre&s;ent to procure a nur&s;e of good cha|racter upon any terms; and it is often nece&s;&s;ary to employ per&s;ons on whom little dependence can be placed, that the &s;ick may not be entirely de&s;titute of a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>Great advantages would therefore be derived from removing the infected, and in &s;ome in&s;tances, perhaps, the whole family, from &s;uch dreadful habitations as I have de&s;cribed, into a clean, airy hou&s;e, which &s;hould be provided by the Committee, till their own cellars could be white-wa&s;hed, and &s;weetened by &s;lacking quick-lime on the floors. It is a que&s;tion for the deci&s;ion of the Committee, whether they would pre|fer renting a hou&s;e, or building a fever-ward for this purpo&s;e. I confe&s;s, that I &s;hould incline to the lat|ter, for the&s;e rea&s;ons:</P>
<P N="1">1. In the erection of a fever-ward, &s;ituation, air, and convenience would be better con&s;ulted; in renting a hou&s;e, &s;ome of the&s;e very important objects might be unavoidably &s;uper&s;eded.</P>
<P N="2">2. Upon &s;uch a permanent e&s;tabli&s;hment, one or more women of decent character might be induced to undertake the office of nur&s;es.</P>
<P N="3">3. By thus bringing the wor&s;t and mo&s;t neglected ca&s;es under one roof, the chance of &s;preading infec|tion
<PB N="228" REF="031593_0237_0FED5304C00F0B90">
would be dimini&s;hed, while attention to the pa|tients on the part of the nur&s;es would be better &s;e|cured, than if the patients were di&s;per&s;ed in different hou&s;es, as, in reality, it would be very difficult to ob|tain a complete hou&s;e, upon any rent, for &s;uch a pur|po&s;e.</P>
<P>To explain this ob&s;ervation, I mu&s;t beg leave to repeat a circum&s;tance which I have &s;tated in my la&s;t volume of Medical E&s;&s;ays. Previous to the building of our di&s;pen&s;ary, when a patient happened to be &s;eized with an infectious fever in the Infirmary, the di&s;ea&s;e was apt to &s;pread to an alarming degree, &s;o as to require a general di&s;mi&s;&s;ion of the patients. But &s;ince a few rooms have been added to the Di&s;pen|&s;ary, for the purpo&s;e of &s;ecluding per&s;ons thus at|tacked, from the re&s;t of the patients, though bad fe|vers have been accidentally introduced, yet by remov|ing the patients on the fir&s;t attack into the fever-ward, the di&s;ea&s;e has always been prevented from extend|ing, without the nece&s;&s;ity of di&s;mi&s;&s;ing a &s;ingle patient. In like manner, I conceive, that by building a fever-ward in each of the Infirmary di&s;tricts, and removing into them the wor&s;t ca&s;es, from the wor&s;t hou&s;es, the progre&s;s of infection would be materially checked, and a great quantity of di&s;ea&s;e and mortality would annually be prevented. This plan would al&s;o give additional &s;ucce&s;s to the Infirmary Phy&s;icians. It would add the chances ari&s;ing from cleanline&s;s, free ventilation, and careful nur&s;ing, to the efficacy of medicines.</P>
<P N="4">4. In a &s;eparate building, the acce&s;s of unnece&s;&s;ary vi&s;itors would be better prevented. It may give the Committee a clearer idea of the extent of this danger, to mention, that an elderly woman, ju&s;t recovering from the fever, informed me, that &s;he had fifteen
<PB N="229" REF="031593_0238_0FED530677CAE9C8">
children, all &s;ettled in the town, and all of whom had undergone the fever within the&s;e two months.</P>
<P>At pre&s;ent, perhaps, it would be mo&s;t expedient for the Committee to try the effect of a &s;ingle fever-ward, in &s;ome part of the town where infection more frequently prevails. In a town like this, &s;uch build|ings can never become entirely u&s;ele&s;s, even if the plans of the Committee &s;hould extend to the length at which I have hinted. The want of proper &s;ewers in &s;everal of the &s;treets, and the offal of &s;laughter-hou&s;es, left to putrefy before the doors in &s;everal places, are nui&s;ances which de&s;erve the &s;erious atten|tion of the Committee.</P>
<P N="5">5. On the &s;ubject of the propagation of infection in Cotton Mills, it may be nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve, that although it has been &s;uppo&s;ed that fever may be im|ported in the Cotton, and though this opinion does not &s;eem improbable in it&s;elf, yet no direct proof of fevers originating from this &s;ource has ever been ob|tained. On the appearance of the pre&s;ent Epidemic at A&s;hton, an alarm of this kind was &s;pread, becau&s;e the fever broke out in the picker's room of a manu|factory there; but I am informed, from very re|&s;pectable authority, that the infection was actually carried thither from Manche&s;ter, by a girl who went to be employed as a picker at A&s;hton. I apprehend that the mi&s;chief ari&s;ing from &s;ome Cotton Mills, as they are at pre&s;ent managed, re&s;ults from</P>
<P N="1">I. The cu&s;tom of working all night.</P>
<P N="2">II. Negligence in wa&s;hing the floors and frames.</P>
<P N="3">III. Negligence re&s;pecting the per&s;onal cleanline&s;s of the work-people, and e&s;pecially of the children.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="230" REF="031593_0239_0FED530929A489A8">IV. Imprudence in permitting convale&s;cents, or per&s;ons coming from infected hou&s;es, to re&s;ume their work, with their clothes &s;aturated with infection.</P>
<P N="5">V. Want of proper ventilation, particularly during the night labor, when the air of the room is render|ed additionally impure by the candles.</P>
<P>With regard to the three fir&s;t articles, I am uncer|tain how far the Committee could with propriety in|terfere. If the proprietors and over&s;eers of manu|factories could be intere&s;ted in the views of the Com|mittee, very advantageous regulations might be form|ed.</P>
<P>The cu&s;tom of working all night totally fru&s;trates every attempt to ventilate the mills thoroughly, while the dirtine&s;s of the per&s;ons employed renders them more di&s;po&s;ed to receive the infection of fever. This cu&s;tom &s;hould, if po&s;&s;ible, be di&s;continued.</P>
<P>The other circum&s;tances might be ea&s;ily regulated by the over&s;eers, who would perhaps be induced to pay more attention to them, if premiums were held out, to over&s;eers who pre&s;erved a given degree of health among the per&s;ons under their care.</P>
<P>The remon&s;trance of &s;o re&s;pectable a body as a Committee of this nature, may al&s;o be expected to have a proper influence, when they call the atten|tion of the proprietors of manufactories, to practices evidently de&s;tructive of health and life.</P>
<P>The great difference in the healthine&s;s of different cotton mills, which it would be invidious to point out here, but which may may be ea&s;ily learnt from the li&s;ts of home-patients kept at the Infirmary, for the la&s;t five years, &s;ufficiently proves the benefits of care
<PB N="231" REF="031593_0240_0FED530E83AA52F0">
re&s;pecting the circum&s;tances I have mentioned, and the danger of inattention.</P>
<P>The readmi&s;&s;ion of convale&s;cents into manufacto|ries, while they are in a &s;tate capable of infecting others, is an obvious cau&s;e of increa&s;ing and perpe|tuating fevers. To prevent this, it would be proper to retain patients in the fever-wards, till their clothes and per&s;ons &s;hould be &s;ufficiently purified, and to caution the over&s;eers of manufactories again&s;t the re|ception of irregular patients, who might return to their employment without leave from their phy&s;i|cian.</P>
<P>A &s;imilar hazard, which ari&s;es from incautious vi|&s;its to the &s;ick, may be mo&s;t effectually counteracted by regulations in the fever-wards. It would be cru|elty to refu&s;e acce&s;s to near relations, in dangerous ca&s;es; but they might be taught to le&s;&s;en the danger of receiving infection, by placing them&s;elves between the patient's bed and the window&mdash;by averting the face while the patient &s;peaks&mdash;and by carefully avoid|ing to &s;it down upon the bed.</P>
<P>All linen belonging to the patients &s;hould be wa&s;h|ed in the fever-wards, for the &s;ame rea&s;on.</P>

<HEAD>CONCLUDING OBSERVATIONS.</HEAD>
<P>From the preceding papers, in union with other accounts of the Yellow Fever, already public, it ap|pears that the following points are well e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>
<P N="1">I. That the Yellow Fever, &s;o called, is only the mo&s;t malignant degree of ordinary bilious fever.</P>
<P N="2">II. That this Fever <HI>may</HI> be, and often <HI>is</HI> generated in the United States, e&s;pecially in the more filthy parts of populous towns.</P>
<P N="3">III. That it is not ordinarily infectious, that is, at|tended with &s;pecific contagion; but may be render|ed &s;o, by peculiar circum&s;tances, that con&s;pire to in|crea&s;e its malignancy.</P>
<P>It &s;eems to be proved that in New-Haven, the di&s;ea&s;e was introduced and propagated by infection. In Philadelphia, it is admitted to have been, to a con&s;iderable degree, contagious. In New-York and Norfolk it is equally clear, the di&s;ea&s;e was <HI>not</HI> intro|duced nor generally propagated by infection. Our be&s;t accounts from Baltimore &s;tate, that the di&s;ea&s;e there was not infectious.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="234" REF="031593_0243_0FED5311ED7B4F80">IV. It is demon&s;trated, beyond all controver&s;y, that bilious fevers are ordinarily produced by the im|pure air generated by the putrefaction of vegetable and animal &s;ub&s;tances. To this effect there mu&s;t concur the following cau&s;es&mdash;vegetable or animal matter, heat and water. Heat and water acting on vegetables, or heat alone on animal matter.

<P>High and dry &s;ituations, in the country, and re|mote from &s;tagnant water, &s;hould be &s;elected for healthine&s;s&mdash;and &s;imilar po&s;itions for cities; but with this additional caution&mdash;to keep them <HI>clean.</HI> The people of a city make filth enough every week, to generate pe&s;tilence, in the hot &s;ea&s;on, and it will pro|duce &s;ickne&s;s, more or le&s;s every &s;ea&s;on, unle&s;s the &s;treets and yards are con&s;tantly, not only &s;wept, but <HI>wa&s;hed.</HI> Wa&s;hing the &s;treets and back-yards &s;hould be as much a bu&s;ine&s;s of police from June to No|vember, as lighting lamps or regulating weights and mea&s;ures. It &s;hould al&s;o be an object of police to calculate the mode of paving and draining &s;treets, for cleanline&s;s, and to direct individuals to do the &s;ame on their back yards. A vigilant police will in&s;pect every article of building, and &s;ee that no <HI>sources</HI> of <HI>pe&s;tilence and death</HI> are lurking behind hou&s;es and &s;tores.</P>
<P N="5">V. Another important conclu&s;ion re&s;ults from the facts &s;tated; this is, that country people have not the &s;malle&s;t rea&s;on for alarm, on account of the &s;pread|ing of the Yellow Fever. It is indeed certain that people from the country, during the exi&s;tence of this fever in town, are more expo&s;ed (if they vi&s;it the town and breathe the air of it) than the inhabitants. But it is demon&s;trated by experience that this fever
<PB N="235" REF="031593_0244_0FED5313A5B1C3D8">
will not &s;pread in a <HI>pure air.</HI> It did not &s;pread even in New-York, over the we&s;tern and well-ventilated part of the city. Hence when the &s;ick remove from town into the country, or when citizens are taken ill with the fever, after leaving the city, the people in the country have no occa&s;ion to avoid the &s;ick, or neglect to ad|mini&s;ter to them all po&s;&s;ible comfort and relief; for there is little danger of taking it in a free whole&s;ome air. Place the &s;ick in an open airy room and keep it clean, and the attendants are in little danger of re|ceiving it.</P>
<P>The panic that &s;eized the whole continent, when the di&s;ea&s;e appeared in Philadelphia, is now found to have been needle&s;s and without ju&s;t cau&s;e; and it is pre&s;umed that &s;uch inhuman caution and barbarous mea&s;ures as were adopted on that occa&s;ion, will ne|ver again di&s;grace our country. In&s;tead of &s;hutting doors again&s;t the flying citizens, let every one open his hou&s;e and give them an ho&s;pitable reception.</P>
<P N="6">VI. The la&s;t remark on this occa&s;ion is that though the immediate cau&s;es of epidemics may be well un|der&s;tood in mo&s;t ca&s;es; yet there appears to be a ne|ce&s;&s;ity, in other ca&s;es, to re&s;ort to a general predi&s;|po&s;ing influence in the atmo&s;phere.</P>
<P>Sometimes it happens that very malignant di&s;ea&s;es will not &s;pread in a country, even when introduced from abroad. At other times, a &s;mall &s;park will en|kindle a flame that cannot be re&s;i&s;ted.</P>
<P>In one year, the putrid &s;ore throat &s;preads its ra|vages in one town&mdash;the next year, in a bordering town. This year the dy&s;entery attacks one town, or perhaps a &s;ingle &s;treet, with fatal malignity&mdash;the next that town is free from it, and the adjacent town
<PB N="236" REF="031593_0245_0FED531872A8B060">
is attacked. The&s;e facts are within every man's re|mark.</P>
<P>But there has been for 6 or 7 years pa&s;t, an ex|traordinary <HI>run</HI> (to u&s;e a vulgar phra&s;e) of malignant di&s;ea&s;es and epidemics. The <HI>Influenza,</HI> in the &s;um|mer of 1789, fir&s;t made its appearance at the &s;outh|ward. It travelled regularly northward, and reached Bo&s;ton the fir&s;t week in November. The next &s;pring, it began in our frontier &s;ettlements, in March, and travelling &s;outhward, reached the Atlantic towns in May. Of this fact, I was a witne&s;s.</P>
<P>The &s;carlet fever &s;ucceeded. It appeared in 1789, or '90, in the &s;tate of New-York, and has pa&s;&s;ed &s;lowly through the ea&s;tern &s;tates, reaching Bo&s;ton and Port&s;mouth the la&s;t year, and it has not yet di&s;|appeared in that quarter.</P>
<P>To the&s;e &s;ucceeded the Yellow Fever, in various places, which has al&s;o had its run.</P>
<P>During the autumnal &s;ea&s;ons, a few years pa&s;t, dy|&s;enteries have al&s;o proved uncommonly mortal, in various parts of the country.</P>
<P>During the &s;ame &s;ea&s;ons, the Yellow Fever has been unu&s;ually frequent and fatal, on the coa&s;t of Africa, and in the We&s;t-Indies.</P>
<P>To what cau&s;e &s;hall we attribute this general pre|valence of malignant di&s;ea&s;es in various quarters of the globe, at the &s;ame time? Specific contagion can|not be the cau&s;e; it will not even account for the rapid progre&s;s of the Influenza in Europe, and in this country, for whole towns were &s;eized with it in a day. The Scarletina Angino&s;a is highly infectious; but it was not propagated generally nor principally by
<PB N="237" REF="031593_0246_0FED531CB1F19948">
infection. On the other hand, children were &s;eized with it in various parts of the country, remote from the di&s;ea&s;ed, and without having the lea&s;t connection with them.</P>
<P>Nay more, I can witne&s;s that when the di&s;ea&s;e was fatal to multitudes in New-York in 1791, and the year before in its wor&s;t forms in Connecticut, the &s;ame di&s;ea&s;e, with &s;lighter &s;ymptoms, was even epi|demic in Hartford. The mild form in which it ap|peared, &s;eemed to be but a prelude to the di&s;ea&s;e which in the two &s;ucceeding years proved &s;o fatal. I was witne&s;s to it, in this mild form in my own family: a &s;evere catarrhal affection, accompanied with high fever, and a partial efflore&s;cence of the &s;kin about the throat and brea&s;t.</P>
<P>This fact would &s;eem to prove, not only a general predi&s;po&s;ing cau&s;e in the atmo&s;phere, but a <HI>progre&s;&s;ive &s;tate</HI> of that cau&s;e.</P>
<P>Another fact would &s;eem to ju&s;tify this remark. It is well known that foreigners, coming from other cli|mates, are very ea&s;ily affected with the di&s;ea&s;es pre|valent at the time of their arrival, and more ea&s;ily take &s;uch di&s;orders than natives.&mdash;Now it is a fact within my ob&s;ervation, that foreigners arriving from Europe at New-York in 1794, were &s;eized with the &s;carlet fever, after it had cea&s;ed to affect native citizens. The re&s;ult of this ob&s;erva|tion is, that the decrea&s;e of the predi&s;po&s;ing influence of the atmo&s;phere, is <HI>progre&s;&s;ive,</HI> and that it was &s;uffi|cient to affect foreigners, for &s;ome time, after it cea&s;ed to affect per&s;ons accu&s;tomed to breathe the air of our climate.</P>
<P><PB N="238" REF="031593_0247_0FED531E66D17C18">Indeed &s;omething of the &s;ame kind is true, with re&s;pect to the Yellow Fever, in New-York. The &s;ame di&s;ea&s;e had appeared, in a few in&s;tances, for two or three &s;ea&s;ons preceding the year 1795. Several ca&s;es occurred in 1794. The&s;e ca&s;es &s;eemed to be harbingers of the more general mortality of the la&s;t &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>I do not know that this di&s;ea&s;e appeared in Phila|delphia, in the la&s;t &s;ea&s;on preceding the fatal autumn of 1793; but &s;everal ca&s;es have occurred the two la&s;t years. A friend of mine who lo&s;t two clerks in the fatal &s;ea&s;on of 1793, lo&s;t two others in 1794, and one in 1795; all from the &s;ame counting hou&s;e.</P>
<P>In the&s;e ca&s;es, there is no pretence of infection.&mdash; The di&s;ea&s;e mu&s;t have &s;prung from local cau&s;es, or the predi&s;po&s;ing influence of the air inhaled by the&s;e unfortunate people.</P>
<P>I am therefore inclined to believe that independent of local cau&s;es, the atmo&s;phere may be and is often affected by &s;ome general invi&s;ible cau&s;es, which, at particular &s;ea&s;ons, di&s;po&s;e the human body to parti|cular di&s;ea&s;es. Whether this di&s;po&s;ition in the air proceeds from the prevalence of particular winds&mdash; of rains&mdash;of heat&mdash;or of fro&s;t; or whether the a&s;|pects of the planets, on the various action of that all-powerful elementary <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">id, <HI>electric fire,</HI> which &s;eems to be the mo&s;t energetic principle in the &s;y&s;tem, may not vary the combination of &s;ub&s;tances compo&s;ing vital air, are que&s;tions for the inve&s;tigation of the philo&s;opher. The facts which are within common ob&s;ervation are &s;ufficient to point to the proximate cau&s;es of di&s;ea&s;e, and that when the&s;e are known, mo&s;t of the evils of &s;ickne&s;s, are brought within the influence of human management&mdash;many of them may be obviated&mdash;all of them, mitigated.</P>
<P><PB N="239" REF="031593_0248_0FED53202F05EEF0">If it is clearly a&s;certained, that the gas generated by the decompo&s;ition of animal and vegetable &s;ub|&s;tances, in putrefaction, is fatal to healthy life; then it becomes a <HI>duty</HI> to depo&s;it &s;uch &s;ub&s;tances in places where they cannot annoy us. It is as much the <HI>duty</HI> of the citizens of populous towns, to clean&s;e their &s;treets, and their back yards, wa&s;h their hou&s;es and bathe their per&s;ons, as it is to provide a Ho&s;pital for the indigent &s;ick, or a grave for the dead.</P>
<P>Thus in the country, people &s;hould choo&s;e dry &s;ituations for their hou&s;es, remote from mar&s;hy grounds. They &s;hould particularly guard again&s;t the noxious effects of the heat on land ju&s;t drained of water. While land is covered with water, even if &s;tagnant, no very pernicious effects are to be appre|hended; but terrible are the effects of a hot &s;un on the putrid &s;ub&s;tances that line the bottoms of ponds, when they are &s;uddenly expo&s;ed, by the draining off of the water.</P>
<P>Thus, al&s;o, &s;ettlers on new lands are to guard again&s;t the fir&s;t effects of clearing moi&s;t land. While veget|able &s;ub&s;tances are covered with water, they are harmle&s;s; and while mar&s;hy grounds are &s;haded by thick fore&s;ts, they produce no di&s;ea&s;e.

But on opening tho&s;e mar|&s;hy grounds to the action of the &s;un, all the latent &s;eeds of di&s;ea&s;e are &s;et in motion and impregnate the &s;urrounding atmo&s;phere. Then the inhabitants be|come &s;ickly, and continue, more or le&s;s, to be &s;o in hot weather, till the &s;urface of the earth is effectually dried or clean&s;ed by ploughing and cultivation.</P>

<HEAD>ADDITIONAL REMARKS.</HEAD>
<P>SINCE the preceding ob&s;ervations were compo&s;ed, the Editor has received the following remarks, from a friend, with liberty to make them public. And as they appear to him of &s;ufficient importance to ju&s;tify an in&s;ertion in this place, he pre&s;umes no apology is nece&s;&s;ary for &s;o doing; although they are, in part, a repetition of his own. A &s;ubject &s;o important to the welfare of the citizens of the United States, can hardly be exhibited in too many points of view.</P>
<P>THE means of prevention, not only of Yellow Fe|vers, but of all other fevers, in any degree of the &s;ame nature, are principally two: and this is equally true in re&s;pect to individuals and communities. The&s;e two means are <HI>temperance</HI> and <HI>cleanliness.</HI></P>
<P N="1">I. TEMPERANCE. No truth is more certain, or more ea&s;ily demon&s;trable by numerous and important facts, than that different climates require different modes of living. It is from inattention to this &s;im|ple truth that a large &s;hare of all the phy&s;ical evils of men ari&s;e.&mdash;Thus, many kinds of food and various liquors, are harmle&s;s, and even nece&s;&s;ary in cold countries, which are ab&s;olutely pernicious in hot cli|mates. Thus, exerci&s;e in the open air, is highly ad|vantageous and healthful, at all hours in the day, in temperate regions; while in many parts of the world, beneath the torrid zone more e&s;pecially, an expo&s;ure to the fogs of the morning, the heats of the noon-tide, or the dews of the night, are certainly de&s;truc|tive.&mdash;Con&s;iderations of this nature are very little thought of, and &s;till le&s;s attended to, among people at
<PB N="241" REF="031593_0250_0FED5328A3A6C520">
large: and indeed the ma&s;s of population, in the greater part of the earth, are incapable of appreciat|ing the con&s;equences of the ob&s;ervance or neglect.&mdash; In all their changes of place, they carry with them the &s;ame cu&s;toms; and it is by long experience only that they are taught the nece&s;&s;ity of adapting their habits to their new &s;ituations.</P>
<P>By far the large&s;t portion of the United States has been peopled by emigrants from the northern coun|tries of Europe. Wherever they have &s;ettled they have continued, with very trifling deviations, to pur|&s;ue their accu&s;tomed occupations and modes of living. Meats and &s;timulating liquors are more u&s;ed in north|ern climates, than in &s;outhern, and with le&s;s di&s;ad|vantage. Our ance&s;tors continued to con&s;ume them after their &s;ettlement in this country, in the &s;ame manner as before; the con&s;equences have been un|fortunate; of late, by connection with other circum&s;tan|ces, they have become &s;till more de&s;tructive, and we are beginning to be alarmed.&mdash;A numerous train of facts; the example of almo&s;t all A&s;ia, Africa, and the &s;outh of Europe; demon&s;trate the advantages of tem|perance, both in foods and drinks, and the fatal effects of a departure therefrom. Rice, and other grains, fruits, and water, form nearly the &s;ole articles of con&s;umption, among the inhabitants of the&s;e countries, during the &s;ultry &s;ea&s;on. It is only on their &s;ea-coa&s;ts, where commerce has collected foreigners from all parts, and e&s;pecially from Europe, and where every &s;pecies of riot and intemperance is common, that the pe&s;ti|lential Fevers, of which we hear &s;o much, prevail.&mdash; In the &s;outh of Europe, in Italy, for in&s;tance, even in the maritime cities, where the people either from nece&s;&s;ity or choice, ab&s;tain from meats, wines and
<PB N="242" REF="031593_0251_0FED532BAB988D90">
other intoxicating liquors, during great part of the year, general and pe&s;tilential di&s;ea&s;es rarely appear: particularly, among tho&s;e nations who are attentive to cleanline&s;s.</P>
<P>The city of Naples contains about four hundred thou&s;and inhabitants; of whom thirty or forty thou|&s;and are &s;aid to belong to the cla&s;s of beggars.&mdash;In that climate the rains prevail, with little intermi&s;&s;ion, for three months&mdash;from February to May. From May to September, a drouth, equally &s;evere, and &s;carcely allayed, in many years, by a &s;ingle plentiful rain, renders the heat almo&s;t intolerable. The wages of a laborer not exceeding eight pence this currency, a day, and meat being rarely had in their markets for le&s;s than four pence the pound, and vinous li|quors in the &s;ame proportion,&mdash;the ma&s;s of popula|tion is excluded from any &s;hare of the&s;e luxuries; of con&s;equence they &s;upport them&s;elves on vegetables, roots, &s;allads, fruits, &amp;c.&mdash;and dilute their food, and animate their &s;pirits, with water and lemonade.&mdash; Yet this city has, for a great number of years, known no general di&s;ea&s;e. And for ten years, no febrile di&s;ea&s;e, of any &s;ort, was common among them.&mdash; They, al&s;o, pay great attention to per&s;onal cleanline&s;s. Facts of this &s;ort are very important, and form the be&s;t comment on the di&s;cordant opinions of our phy&s;i|cians.</P>
<P N="2">II. CLEANLINESS. It is to the rigid ob&s;ervance which the ea&s;tern nations pay to ablution, that, in connection with their habitual temperance, we are to a&s;cribe their &s;uperior health and longevity; and to the neglect of the inhabitants of the &s;outhern parts of America, in re&s;pect of both the&s;e particulars, their
<PB N="243" REF="031593_0252_0FED532D63B63A28">
&s;ickne&s;s and mortality.&mdash;It is impo&s;&s;ible to pre&s;s this matter too forcibly upon nations, communities, fami|lies, and individuals. All are concerned in it.&mdash;The people of the United States, as a people, are noted for hou&s;ehold cleanline&s;s. They are far below the Dutch in re&s;pect to the &s;alubrity and purity of their towns; and below the French, Italians, and even Swedes and Ru&s;&s;ians, in regard to per&s;onal cleanline&s;s.</P>
<P>In many parts of Italy, public baths are more nu|merous than coffee-hou&s;es and taverns. In France, machines and uten&s;ils for bathing, form an e&s;&s;ential part of the hou&s;ehold furniture of every well-regu|lated family; and a woman would as &s;oon think of going into company, with unwa&s;hed hands and un|combed hair, as without having made u&s;e of the bath. In Sweden and Ru&s;&s;ia, the poore&s;t and mo&s;t abject of both &s;exes, would hold them&s;elves unworthy to appear before the Deity in his temple, on the Sab|bath, if they had not devoted &s;ome part of the pre|ceding day to per&s;onal ablution. This is not the ca&s;e in England; and the con&s;equences of the&s;e national cu&s;toms may be traced in the hi&s;tory of our own country. Who does not recollect the mortality which prevailed among the early Engli&s;h coloni&s;ts in Virginia? Who has not read, or heard, of the <HI>long fevers,</HI> as they were called, of the New-England &s;tates?&mdash;But did ever any per&s;on learn that the&s;e mi&s;|fortunes afflicted Penn&s;ylvania and New-Jer&s;ey while they were called New-Sweden?&mdash;Philadelphia and the neighboring parts of New-Jer&s;ey, were originally &s;ettled by Swedes. The&s;e people were neither more robu&s;t, nor more circum&s;pect, in the generality of things, than the Engli&s;h &s;ettlers; but they brought with them their habits of per&s;onal cleanline&s;s, and
<PB N="244" REF="031593_0253_0FED5330710B9E48">
they were rarely vi&s;ited by di&s;ea&s;es.&mdash;Even &s;o late as when Profe&s;&s;or Kalm vi&s;ited this country, the prac|tice of univer&s;al weekly bathing, was &s;till pre&s;erved, among the remnant of the Swedi&s;h inhabitants.</P>
<P>In former ages, and among the celebrated nations of antiquity, per&s;onal, as well as general cleanline&s;s, was con&s;ecrated by numerous rites, and incorporated into every religion. Among a barbarous and igno|norant people, this was, perhaps, the only means of &s;ecuring a proper ob&s;ervance of this duty. It were fortunate for the United States if the old di&s;pen&s;a|tion were revived, in this particular. The laws of Mo&s;es, in relation to the virtue of cleanline&s;s, bear impre&s;&s;ed on their front, the characters of a wi&s;dom nothing &s;hort of divine.&mdash;The days of prophets and of miracles are pa&s;t; but &s;urely, in a matter of &s;uch e&s;&s;ential importance to the well-being of our country, the care of legi&s;lation &s;hould be extended to &s;upply the neglect of the morali&s;t. Tho&s;e rulers but par|tially con&s;ult the durable felicity of the people they govern, who through ignorance, indolence, or a &s;pirit of par&s;imony, mi&s;called economy, overlook, or fail to remedy, a defect &s;o intere&s;ting to private and public happine&s;s, to individual and general tranquility and virtue.</P>
<P>IN addition to the preceding ob&s;ervations, one re|mark further may be addre&s;&s;ed to the people of the United States, generally, but more particularly to the &s;ettlers on the new lands.&mdash;Great and &s;udden altera|tions in the face of a country, rarely fail of being fol|lowed by changes in the &s;tate of the inhabitants of
<PB N="245" REF="031593_0254_0FED53333720CB00">
that country, proportionably rapid and con&s;iderable. The opening of new land and water communications, the draining of mar&s;hes and de&s;truction of fore&s;ts, have a mo&s;t exten&s;ive, and often unfortunate influ|ence, for a time, on the country in which they take place. As one of the &s;ure&s;t means of preventing bad con&s;equences, the attention of the people engaged in undertakings of this kind, &s;hould be turned to the inducing as rapid and luxuriant a vegetation, on all &s;uch clearings up, as po&s;&s;ible. It behoves them, likewi&s;e, to pay a double regard to the duties of order, temperance, and cleanline&s;s. The mo&s;t fatal effects follow from neglect in the&s;e particulars; and e&s;pecially from that free u&s;e of &s;pirituous liquors, which from erroneous notions of their utility, is &s;o commonly re&s;orted to.</P>
