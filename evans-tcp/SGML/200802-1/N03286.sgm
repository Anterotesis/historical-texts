<P>_THE Occa&s;ion and De&s;ign of this large and excellent Epi&s;tle of <HI>Paul</HI> to the <HI>Corinthians,</HI> appears from the Con|tents of it; wherein the Apo&s;tle having reproved the Di&s;orders and Factions of the Church of <HI>Corinth,</HI> and re&s;olv'd &s;everal Ca&s;es, and in|&s;tructed &amp; directed them in &s;everal important Duties of Chri&s;tianity, and confuted &s;ome Errors of dangerous Con&s;equence that had &s;prung up among them thro' the Influence of fal&s;e Teachers, particularly <HI>that</HI> relating to the Re&s;urrection, proceeds in the Clo&s;e of all, in this

16<HI>th Chapter,</HI> to direct and exhort them to &s;undry di&s;tinct Duties, among which is <HI>that</HI> in our <HI>Text</HI>; which being ob&s;erv'd, 'twill be the le&s;s needful to look into the Context for clearing the Sen&s;e of the&s;e Words, which indeed, are, in a Manner, independent, either on the preceeding or &s;ub&s;equent Ver&s;es. The holy Apo&s;tle being aware of the Dangers that &s;till threatned the Church of <HI>Corinth</HI> in their pre&s;ent un&s;ettled State, thro' inte&s;tine Divi&s;ions, and "the Leaven of their old Max|ims and Manners that had not been throughly purged out by the Chri&s;tian Principles they had entertained," and thro' the re&s;tle&s;s Agency of Satan and his In&s;tru|ments, to corrupt their Faith and Practice, cou'd not forbear expre&s;&s;ing his hearty Affection and Concern for them, by leaving with them the&s;e important Words of Caution and Coun&s;el, <HI>Watch ye, &s;tand fa&s;t in the Faith, quit you like Men, be &s;trong.</HI></P>
<P>The Phra&s;es here u&s;ed appear at fir&s;t View to be of a Military Import, being borrowed from the Cu&s;tom of War, wherein, as Soldiers in the Camp, Garri&s;on, or City, are &s;et to keep Watch and Ward, to de&s;cry Dan|gers at a Di&s;tance, to give timely Notice of the Ap|proach of an Enemy, that they might be in a prepared Po&s;ture of Defence, &s;o Chri&s;tians who are engaged in a &s;piritual War, are highly concern'd to <HI>Watch,</HI> to keep their &s;piritual Sen&s;es awake and in Exerci&s;e, that they may be always on their Guard again&s;t the Dan|gers that continually &s;urround them from their &s;piritual Enemies, the World, the Fle&s;h and the Devil, and be in a Readine&s;s, with Wi&s;dom and Skill in the U&s;e of their &s;piritual Armour, to oppo&s;e their malicious De&s;igns, and to &s;ecure and defend them&s;elves. And as Soldiers being about to face an Enemy, are exhorted and en|couraged to &s;tand their Ground, to be true and faithful to their Leaders, and to &s;tand firm in the Defence of the Cau&s;e and Intere&s;t of their Country, and of their publick Liberties, &s;o Chri&s;tians are, an&s;werably here|unto, required to <HI>Stand fa&s;t in the Faith,</HI> their Faith being not only the main Part of their Armour, with

And again <HI>Chap.</HI> 10 25 God him&s;elf had encouraged <HI>Jo&s;hua</HI> with the &s;ame Words, <HI>Chap.</HI> 1.9. And the like Speech often occurs to the &s;ame Purpo&s;e.

Thus we find the <HI>Phili&s;tines</HI> &s;tirring up each others Courage to Fight again&s;t <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> when they under&s;tood that the Ark of God was bro't into the Camp. <HI>Be &s;trong and quit your &s;elves like Men,</HI>&mdash;in the very Words of the Text. 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 4 9.

<HEAD><HI>DOCTRINE.</HI> That Chri&s;tians in the Management of their &s;piritual Warfare, mu&s;t quit them&s;elves like Men, and be &s;trong.</HEAD>
<P>And I hope to make it appear both in the doctrinal and applicatory Part of my Di&s;cour&s;e, That <HI>true Man|lyne&s;s is &s;upported and improved by the Principles and Rules of Chri&s;tianity.</HI> And here,</P>
<P N="1">1. It is &s;uppo&s;ed that <HI>our pre&s;ent State in the World is a warfaring State</HI>; our Life is a Warfare, which it requires the Wi&s;dom, Skill and Courage of Men, to manage aright; and in this Warfare we are concern'd both as Men and as Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>As Men.</HI> Job 7.1. <HI>Is there not an appointed Time,</HI> or as the Tran&s;lation is varied in the Margin, <HI>Is there not a Warfare for Man upon Earth</HI>? Man is born to various Labours, Struggles and Conflicts, which are not terminated but in Death. This Warfare is both Exter|nal and Internal. <HI>External,</HI> ari&s;ing from a thou&s;and Dangers, Hard&s;hips, Adver&s;ities, Cro&s;&s;es &amp; Oppo&s;itions that befall us in the World. <HI>Internal,</HI> proceeding from the di&s;quieting Pa&s;&s;ions, excited by external Objects, Anger, Grief, Sorrow, Fear, Shame, De&s;pair, and the like, with which we are expo&s;ed to daily Conflicts: &s;o that oftentimes <HI>without</HI> are <HI>Fightings,</HI> and <HI>within</HI> are <HI>Fears</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2. Cor. vii 5.</NOTE>. But more e&s;pecially,</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>As Chri&s;tians,</HI> li&s;ted under Chri&s;t's Banner, we are engag'd in a Warfare with his, and our Soul's Enemies,

Sin, Satan, the World and the Fle&s;h: All the&s;e hold in Confederacy together. <HI>Satan</HI>'s Kingdom, which is &s;et up in Oppo&s;ition to the Kingdom of Chri&s;t, is founded in <HI>Sin</HI>: And the Temptations of the <HI>World,</HI> both its Allurements and Terrors, are his Auxiliaries; and <HI>fle&s;hly Lu&s;ts</HI> are the Traitors in our own Bo&s;oms that hold Corre&s;pondence with this Enemy, and give him mighty Advantages again&s;t us, and are therefore the mo&s;t dangerous of all. Now with all the&s;e our &s;piritual Enemies, we have openly declared War, by taking upon us a Chri&s;tian Profe&s;&s;ion, and by coming over into the Camp of Chri&s;t, and renouncing the Intere&s;ts of Sin and Satan. And therefore in Point of Duty and Fidelity to our Lord Redeemer, the <HI>Captain of our Salvation,</HI> as well as from a prudent Regard to our own &s;piritual Peace and Welfare, we ought to be con&s;tantly arm'd for a Conflict, to take to our&s;elves, and with Wi&s;dom, Courage and Re&s;olution to improve, the <HI>whole</HI> &s;piritual <HI>Armour</HI> he has furni&s;h'd us withal. <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Eph. vi. 11.</NOTE></P>
<P>Wherefore,</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>In the Management of this &s;piritual Warfare, we mu&s;t quit our &s;elves like Men, and be &s;trong.</HI></P>
<P>Now the Enquiry is,</P>
<P><HI>Q</HI> What Matter of Duty is laid upon us by this Charg,e to <HI>quit our &s;elves like Men</HI>? The latter In|junction, <HI>Be &s;trong,</HI> comes in as an Explication of the former, and &s;hews in one &s;pecial In&s;tance, how we mu&s;t <HI>quit our &s;elves like Men,</HI> viz. by putting on Strength, Re&s;olution and Courage, becoming <HI>Men</HI>; and therefore may be con&s;ider'd as one main Branch under this ge|neral Head, <HI>wherein true Manhood con&s;i&s;ts</HI>? Or <HI>how mu&s;t we quit our &s;elves like Men</HI>?</P>
<P>I An&s;wer, We may be &s;aid to <HI>quit our &s;elves like Men,</HI> either by <HI>governing our &s;elves by Principles of
<PB N="6" REF="004000_0008_100366EACB25C668">
Rea&s;on,</HI> whereby <HI>Men</HI> are differenced from <HI>Brutes,</HI> or by <HI>&s;hewing forth a manly Spirit,</HI> whereby <HI>Men</HI> di&s;tin|gui&s;h them&s;elves from <HI>Children.</HI> Both the&s;e Ways we mu&s;t <HI>quit</HI> our &s;elves <HI>like Men.</HI> Therefore,</P>
<P N="1">1. In general, <HI>To be truly Religious, is to quit our &s;elves like Men,</HI> like rea&s;onable Creatures: For Religi|on is the highe&s;t Improvement and Exaltation of Rea|&s;on, and that which puts the main Difference between Men and Bea&s;ts. All the Rea&s;on of Man is for Reli|gion and Holine&s;s, and again&s;t Sin. Hence that up|braiding Admonition to Idolaters, I&s;ai. 46 8 <HI>Remember this, and &s;hew your &s;elves Men.</HI> If Sinners would <HI>&s;hew them&s;elves Men,</HI> and act up to the Dignity of the humane Nature, and exert the peculiar Powers and Capacities of it, they mu&s;t needs become Religious, and abandon all Irreligion, Sin and Wickedne&s;s, which is highly Irrational, be&s;ides Rea&s;on, and again&s;t it: Whereas all the &s;tated Laws of Religion are adju&s;ted to the &s;tricte&s;t Rea&s;on; Piety and Devotion towards God, Righteou&s;ne&s;s and Charity towards Man, Sobriety and Temperance with Re&s;pect to our &s;elves, (in which the Sum of practical Religion con&s;i&s;ts <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Titus ii. 12.</NOTE>) are Things unexceptionably ju&s;t, and approve them&s;elves to the pure&s;t Rea&s;on of Mankind. In the moral Government of Man, God dealeth with him as a rea&s;onable Creature; in all the Revelations of his Will concerning Man's Duty and Happine&s;s, he &s;till addre&s;&s;es him as a rational free Agent. So he &s;peaks in the Prophet I&s;ai. 1.18, 19, 20. <HI>Come, and let us Rea&s;on together, &s;aith the Lord, &mdash; if ye be Willing and Obedient, ye &s;hall eat the Good of the Land,</HI> &amp;c. His <HI>Laws</HI> are &s;o adapted to our rea&s;onable Powers, and as it were interwoven with them, that were we freed from the bya&s;s of carnal Af|fections and Pa&s;&s;ions, which participate of the Temper of the Body, wherein we are ally'd to the Brute Ani|mals, and were we at Liberty to pur&s;ue the rational

Dictates of our Minds, Religion in its &s;tricte&s;t Rules wou'd not be tho't Grievous, but embraced out of Cho<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">ce, as a Thing connatural, ea&s;y plea&s;ant, and the mo&s;t beautiful and amiable Thing in the World. Moreover, all the <HI>Promi&s;es</HI> and <HI>Threatnings</HI> of God's Word are &s;uited to the Principles of Man's Nature, as he is a Creature endowed with a rational Judgment, and Liberty of Choice, capable of being influenc'd in his Actions by Hopes and Fears <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Deut. xxx. 19.</NOTE>. So that <HI>then</HI> we may be truly &s;aid to act <HI>like Men,</HI> when we behave our &s;elves towards God as Creatures, &s;o made, ought to do, in pur&s;uing the End of our Beings, by u&s;ing aright the noble Powers of our rational Natures, in all the In|&s;tances of a &s;ober, righteous, and godly Life, which is a Thing &s;o Ju&s;t, that none can except again&s;t it, with|out di&s;claiming, at the &s;ame Time, the Principles of Rea&s;on and Humanity. More particularly,</P>
<P N="2">2. To quit our &s;elves like Men, is <HI>to put away chil|di&s;h Things,</HI> and to put forth the Virtues &amp; Perfections of a manly Spirit.</P>
<P N="1"><HI>1.</HI> We mu&s;t <HI>put away childi&s;h Things. When I was a Child,</HI> &s;aith the Apo&s;tle, <HI>I &s;pake as a Child, I un|der&s;tood as a Child, I thought as a Child, but when I became a Man, I put away childi&s;h Things</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. xiii. 11</NOTE>. It is un|becoming Men in their adult Age, to think, &s;peak, and bu&s;y them&s;elves like Children. So if Chri&s;tians would act like Men, and pre&s;erve the Dignity of their Natures, as Men, and Chri&s;tians, they mu&s;t put away the Follies, Vices, and Impertinences of Children, which through the Weakne&s;s of their Age, or the Corruption of their Natures, they are &s;ubject to.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t put away,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Childi&s;h Thoughts.</HI> How vain and confu&s;ed are Childrens Thoughts and Fancies, which they de&s;pi&s;e
<PB N="8" REF="004000_0010_100366F8D759C0B0">
and reject when they arrive to riper Years? Thus Chri&s;tians mu&s;t guard their Minds again&s;t all vain, fooli&s;h, trifling and confu&s;ed Thoughts and Mu&s;ings, e&s;pecially all vicious Imaginations; and learn to think &s;eriou&s;ly, clo&s;ely, and pertinently, as Men of ripe Parts, and employ their Meditations upon the <HI>great Things</HI> of God's Law and Go&s;pel; Things Spiritual and Heavenly; and not &s;uffer earthly Things to en|gro&s;s all their Thoughts and Studies, and fill their Minds from Morning to Night, without leaving Room for the more &s;erious and &s;piritual Exerci&s;es of the Mind. Thoughts excited by, and exerci&s;ed upon &s;en|&s;ible Objects, are childi&s;h Thoughts, mean and trifling in compari&s;on of the more rational, manly, and &s;ublime Meditations on the &s;piritual My&s;teries of Religion; the delightful Exerci&s;e of pious Souls <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">P&s;alm i. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Childi&s;h Talk.</HI> All un&s;avory, vain, frothy, unedi|fying Communication, is unbecoming the Gravity of Chri&s;tians, even as Childrens Talk is unbecoming Men of Under&s;tanding. In all our Conver&s;ation we &s;hou'd have Regard not only to Truth and Charity, but to Decency, and con&s;ider what is <HI>becoming</HI> our holy Pro|fe&s;&s;ion. <HI>But Fornication and all Uncleanne&s;s, or Cove|tuou&s;ne&s;s, let it not be once named among you, as becometh Saints; neither fooli&s;h Talking, nor Je&s;ting which are not convenient,</HI> &s;aith the Apo&s;tle, (Eph. 5.3, 4.) And again, <HI>Let no corrupt Communication proceed out of your Mouth, but that which is Good to the U&s;e of edifying,</HI> (Chap. 4.29.)</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Childi&s;h Pa&s;times.</HI> The Age of Youth and Child|hood is "the plea&s;ant playing Age." 'Tis promi&s;ed as an In&s;tance of God's Favour to <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> (Zech. 8.5.) That <HI>the Streets of the City &s;hall be full of Boys and Girls, playing in the Streets thereof.</HI> 'Tis decent enough for Children, who for want of Di&s;cretion of Mind, or

Ability of Body, are not fit for more &s;erious Bu&s;ine&s;s, for "Boys and Girls to play in the Streets;" but it is un&s;eemly and &s;candalous in Men and Women to &s;pend their Time in Sports and Diver&s;ions, who&s;e Age and Capacity fit them for graver Employments. Herein Chri&s;tians mu&s;t act like Men in renouncing vain, carnal Myrth and Pa&s;times, and filling up their Time, as much as this State of Imperfection will admit, with the Bu&s;ine&s;s of their general and particular Callings. <HI>See that ye walk circum&s;pectly, not as Fools, but as Wi&s;e&punc; redeeming the Time,</HI> (Eph. 5.15, 16) <HI>Not &s;lothful in Bu|&s;ine&s;s; fervent in Spirit, &s;erving the Lord,</HI> (Rom. 12.11.)</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Childi&s;h Pa&s;&s;ions.</HI> Children are often peevi&s;h and quarrel&s;om, &s;ullen and out of Humour at every &s;light Di&s;gu&s;t. Quarrels and Contentions are childi&s;h Things, which Chri&s;tians &s;hou'd put far away from them; e&s;|pecially &s;uch as ari&s;e from &s;mall Provocations: Some may, perhaps, think they act a manly Part to re&s;ent every Slight put upon them, to manife&s;t their Di&s;plea|&s;ure at every petty Injury or Affront, to bear a Grudge, and &s;tudy Revenge; and that it is a weak and cow|ardly Part to put up Wrongs and Abu&s;es; but really it is a childi&s;h Weakne&s;s, not to be able to curb the Pa&s;&s;ions, and &s;hews they want that Command of them|&s;elves, that Men of Rea&s;on ought to have: and that they want that <HI>Di&s;cretion of a Man that deferreth his Anger,</HI> (Prov. 19.11.) The contrary Temper often di&s;covers Mens Shame and Folly; for <HI>a Fools Wrath is pre&s;ently known</HI>&punc; &s;aith Solomon, <HI>but a prudent Man covereth Shame,</HI> (Prov. 12.16)</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>Childi&s;h Appetites and De&s;ires</HI>; and the&s;e both as to the Matter and Manner of them. As to <HI>the Matter</HI> of them, Things agreable to the Sen&s;es: For Children are led by Sen&s;e, before they come to the u&s;e of Rea|&s;on, and are much better pleas'd with Toys that take their Sen&s;es, than with tho&s;e Things which would do them a real Benefit. Young People are for <HI>walking

And therefore are like Children herein, who are led by Sen&s;e, who&s;e De&s;ires are mainly carry'd out to carnal Things, that &s;uit the Appetites and Conveniences of the Body, and have no Ta&s;te or Reli&s;h for Things Spiritual; thus <HI>they that are after the Fle&s;h, do mind the Things of the Fle&s;h</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. viii. 5.</NOTE>. But Chri&s;tians mu&s;t be otherwi&s;e minded, to di&s;tingui&s;h them&s;elves from Children, and mu&s;t renounce the Con|duct of Sen&s;e, and &s;ubordinate Sen&s;e to Rea&s;on and Faith.

whatever Temptations, Difficulties, or Di&s;couragements are thrown in the Way to ob&s;truct us herein, or divert us therefrom.</P>
<P>True Fortitude holds the <HI>Mean</HI> between tho&s;e two Extreams of a daring <HI>Ra&s;hne&s;s</HI> on the one Hand, and a &s;neaking <HI>Cowardice</HI> on the other. <HI>Ra&s;hne&s;s</HI> offends in the <HI>Exce&s;s,</HI> when Men out of fooli&s;h Ob&s;tinacy, expo&s;e them&s;elves to Dangers, or ru&s;h into them unadvi&s;edly and without nece&s;&s;ity, prompted by vain Glory, or any other head&s;trong Pa&s;&s;ion, not duly con&s;idering the Con&s;equences of their Actions. <HI>Cowardice</HI> is as much an Error in the <HI>Defect,</HI> when Men are prevailed with to decline their Duty, or to de&s;ert a good Cau&s;e in which they are engag'd, thro' Fear and Di&s;pondency of Mind, under a pro&s;pect of Difficulties and Dangers. But in Oppo&s;ition to both the&s;e Extreams, a true Spirit of Fortitude, as it will not expo&s;e a Man to needle&s;s Dangers, &s;o it will enable him, being &s;upported by Faith and Hope in God, to go on with a re&s;olved Con|&s;tancy in the Way of his Duty, without &s;hrinking or &s;werving, whatever Fears he may be impre&s;s'd with, or whatever Temptations, Difficulties, or Dangers may pre&s;ent them&s;elves to his View.</P>
<P>The &s;huning of needle&s;s Dangers, is an Effect of that Wi&s;dom and Precaution that is proper to a rea&s;onable Creature, in Pur&s;uance of the grand Principle of &s;elf Pre&s;ervation, implanted by the wi&s;e Creator, in all rational and &s;en&s;itive Beings; and therefore not incon|&s;i&s;tent with a valiant Spirit, which can contemn the greate&s;t Dangers, when a virtuous and good Cau&s;e makes it nece&s;&s;ary to encounter them.</P>
<P>Nor, again, is it an Argument of a weak and cow|ardly Spirit, to be impre&s;s'd with Fear of tho&s;e Evils, which we mu&s;t unavoidably encounter, if we would per&s;evere in the Way of our Duty. This is evident beyond Exception from the Example of the <HI>Man Chri&s;t Je&s;us,</HI> who, as in all other manly Perfections, &s;o in a Spirit

of Courage &amp; Might, incomparably excell'd all the Chil|dren of Men; a &s;ignal <HI>Specimen</HI> whereof, he gave the Night before his Sufferings, when having eaten the <HI>Pa&s;&s;over</HI> with his Di&s;ciples, (in the original In&s;titution whereof, the <HI>I&s;|raelites</HI> were forbid to go out of their Hou&s;es, for fear of the de&s;troying Angel <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Exod. xii. 22, 23.</NOTE>, yet,) he couragiou&s;ly went forth to meet his Enemies (having a full Pro&s;pect of all the Circum&s;tances of his Pa&s;&s;ion) as it were challenging all the Powers of Darkne&s;s, in &s;uch tri|umphant Language (we may &s;uppo&s;e) as that in which he is bro't in &s;peaking, by the evangelical Prophet, in his State of Humiliation, <HI>He is near, that ju&s;tifieth me, who will contend with me?

But was he then without all Fears? No; the Evangeli&s;t tells us, that he was <HI>&s;ore Amazed,</HI> (Mark 14.33.) And the Author to the <HI>Hebrews,</HI> that <HI>he Feared,</HI> (Heb. 5.7.) The&s;e Fears argued no Degree of De&s;pondency, but were the Effect of the natural Reluctancy of the innocent humane Nature of our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour, again&s;t his Sufferings in View; but his Courage exceeded his Fears, and carried him tri|umphantly through all. Fear is an involuntary Im|pre&s;&s;ion on the Mind of a rea&s;onable Creature, ari&s;ing from the Pre-apprehen&s;ions of approaching Evils, e&s;|pecially if they be great, near, and unavoidable. Some may &s;eem to be courageous and fearle&s;s, through meer Ignorance, or a &s;tupid Incon&s;ideration of the Cau&s;es of Fear. But the greater &s;uch Fears are, that ari&s;e from a ju&s;t Cau&s;e, the greater is the Courage and Re&s;olution that with&s;tands them, that breaks through them, and gets the Ma&s;tery of them.</P>

Addre&s;s to Men of that Order, &amp; that it may appear that the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> and the <HI>Soldier</HI> are not Terms incompa|tible. Let me ob&s;erve in a few Words,</P>
<P N="1">1. That it is beyond Di&s;pute, that the People &amp; Servants of God under the Old Te&s;tament (among whom, were divers eminently pious and holy Per&s;ons) took up Arms and made War again&s;t their Enemies, by a manife&s;t di|vine Direction and Approbation; which &s;hews that the Thing is not in <HI>it &s;elf</HI> Unlawful; nor is there the lea&s;t Hint in the &s;acred Writings, that leads us to conclude it to be &s;o; on the contrary, if we would form a Judg|ment by the Light of Nature, it appears rea&s;onable and ju&s;t, being directed to; and warranted, e&s;pecially in Ca&s;e of an inju&s;t Inva&s;ion, by the natural Law of &s;elf Pre|&s;ervation. Hence,</P>
<P N="2">2. Let me ob&s;erve, That there is no Alteration made in tho&s;e Things that are founded on the <HI>Law of Na|ture</HI> or <HI>Nations,</HI> by the Religion of the <HI>New Te&s;tament</HI> of our Saviour. It being very remote from the De&s;ign of Chri&s;t, or of the fir&s;t Preachers of the Go&s;pel, to erect a new civil Polity in the World, or to aboli&s;h any <HI>Ordinance of Man</HI> for the Pre&s;ervation of the Peace and Order of civil Society. As therefore, particular Per&s;ons are allow'd, and required by the immutable, and unrepealable Law of Nature, to repel force by force in nece&s;&s;ary &s;elf Defence; &s;o by the &s;ame Right, Kingdoms and politick Bodies, may lawfully de|fend them&s;elves again&s;t any injurious, encroaching Enemy, by exerting the Force proper to them, as &s;uch: And this warrants, at lea&s;t a defen&s;ive War. And al|lowing but the Lawfulne&s;s of a <HI>defen&s;ive War</HI> (on Grounds of Nature) again&s;t an unju&s;t Aggre&s;&s;or, even this is &s;ufficient to ju&s;tify the military Employment. The Kingdom which our ble&s;&s;ed Lord came to &s;et up in the World, being of a &s;piritual and heavenly Nature, does not at all interfere with the Rights of Nations, or earthly Kingdoms, but leaves them as fully po&s;|&s;e&s;s'd of them, as it found them.

<P>The Force of this rea&s;oning may not be evaded by pretending that <HI>John</HI> was a legal Preacher, or that he entred on his Mini&s;try before the Go&s;pel Di&s;pen&s;ation began; for we are expre&s;ly told, that <HI>the Law</HI> conti|nued <HI>until John,</HI> and <HI>from the Days of John the Bap|ti&s;t, the Kingdom of God was preached</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Mat. xi. 12, 13, Luk. 16.16.</NOTE>.

<P>We have the Examples of &s;everal eminent Soldiers, who embraced the Chri&s;tian Faith, without the lea&s;t Intimation of their quitting the military Function, or their being directed and order'd to do &s;o, either by Chri&s;t&punc; or his Apo&s;tles.

<P>Further we may ob&s;erve, That by the Doctrines and Precepts of the Go&s;pel, the Authority of the civil Ma|gi&s;trate is e&s;tabli&s;hed, and all Chri&s;tians obliged to Obedience and Submi&s;&s;ion to it <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. xiii. i.

<PB N="28" REF="004000_0030_100372DF96292FF0">
who is not &s;en&s;ible, that military Men, valiant and expert in War, good Soldiers and well di&s;ciplin'd Ar|mies, are not only lawful, but highly nece&s;&s;ary and U&s;eful, and at all times to be encouraged, and ju&s;tly to be e&s;teemed the Beauty and Ornament, and under God, the Strength and Defence of a People? So that a Chri&s;tian may not only with a good Con&s;cience un|dertake the military Function, when call'd thereunto, but may al&s;o therein perform eminent Service for God and his Country, by exerting that publick Spirit, that Zeal and Courage, which his Chri&s;tian Principles in&s;pire him withal. The Objections made again&s;t this, from the Commands of Chri&s;t, requiring an univer&s;al Love, and peaceable Spirit in his Di&s;ciples and Followers, and forbidding Revenge, duely con&s;ider'd and exa|min'd, appear to be of no Weight: For our Saviour forbidding to <HI>re&s;i&s;t Evil, (Matt.</HI> 5.39.) intends only to lay a Re&s;traint on private Revenge: For the Apo&s;tle inculcating the &s;ame Prohibition, (Rom 12 19) <HI>Dear|ly beloved, avenge not your &s;elves</HI> &amp;c.) does not include all kind of Revenge, but only <HI>that</HI> between private Men; for he pre&s;ently &s;ubjoin, in the Beginning of the next Chapter, (<HI>Ver&s;e</HI> 4.)

Now War is a kind of publick Revenge, and the being In&s;trumental therein, has no nece&s;&s;ary Connection with a vindictive Spirit, which the Go&s;pel forbids; and as to a Spirit of Peace and Charity, which it con&s;tantly recommends, 'tis certain there is nothing more e&s;&s;ential to the Temper and <HI>Genius</HI> of Chri&s;tianity, yet this Temper is not incon&s;i&s;tent with the Office of bearing Arms again&s;t the injurious Ad|ver&s;aries of ones Country <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">As to that Prediction of the Prophets, (<HI>I&s;ai</HI> 2 4. and <HI>Mic.</HI> 4 3.) concerning the Nations <HI>beating the Swords into Plow|&s;hares,</HI> &amp;c. and their <HI>not learning War any more,</HI> which has been objected again&s;t the Lawfulne&s;s of Chri&s;tians making War; it may be under&s;tood as a De&s;cription of the Nature of the Kingdom of Chri&s;t, which (where&s;oever, and &s;o far as it prevails) will remove the Grounds and Occa&s;ions of Wars and Fightings, by extingui&s;hing tho&s;e corrupt Lu&s;ts of Men that give ri&s;e to them, and by implanting in their Hearts, oppo&s;ite Principles of Peace and Love. And all that can be gather'd hence, is, that to provoke and &s;tir up Wars and Quarrels, is contrary to the Principles and Laws of the Chri&s;tian Religion, which (were they univer&s;ally entertain'd) would introduce an univer&s;al Peace and Har|mony; but by no Means that it is unlawful for a Chri&s;tian People to make U&s;e of Arms in their ju&s;t and nece&s;&s;ary Defence again&s;t the violent Encroachments of an Enemy. <HI>Indignum e&s;t, e&s;&s;e inter Chri&s;tianos, qui vim inferant, &s;ed non indignum e&s;t Magi&s;tratu Chri&s;tiano, vim illatam propul&s;are.</HI> Rivet&punc; <HI>in Decalogum.</HI> Or if it be under&s;tood as a Predicti|on or Promi&s;e, to be literally verified, it mu&s;t have refer|ence to &s;ome future happy Period of the Church, when the peaceable Kingdom and Government of Je&s;us Chri&s;t &s;hall more univer&s;ally obtain, and prevail in the Kingdoms of Men.

There is indeed a Difference between <HI>military Valour,</HI> and <HI>Chri&s;tian Fortitude.</HI> The one is more active, the other more pa&s;&s;ive: The one is more &s;een in acting with Vigour and Re&s;olution, in great and hazardous Enterprizes; the other is more di&s;cover'd in &s;uffering Hard&s;hips, and Grievances, with Con&s;tancy of Mind, Faith, and Re|&s;ignation to God; in &s;u&s;taining with an un&s;haken Firm|ne&s;s of Spirit, the A&s;&s;aults and Oppo&s;itions it meets with in a Cour&s;e of Virtue and Holine&s;s. The former de|pends more on bodily Strength, and the Warmth and Sprightline&s;s of the natural Con&s;titution, &s;uited to that external Warfare to which it is apply'd; the latter depends more on the Improvement of the Mind, by the Grace of God's holy Spirit, and tho&s;e divine Qua|lities and Principles, wrought into the Temper of the Soul, that e&s;tabli&s;h and &s;trengthen it again&s;t all Temp|tations and Terrors.

<P>The&s;e are two different Things, tho' they mutually &s;upport and befriend each other; and it is a de&s;irable Thing that tho&s;e who excell in military Skill, might al&s;o excell in true Valour; and on the contrary, that tho&s;e who excel in a Spirit of Valour, might be endow'd with equal Skill to guide and manage it; yet 'tis known, the&s;e do not always go together.

And &s;ince all Occa&s;ion of exerting this Spirit of Valour in any mi|litary Service, is now happily prevented by the Peace
