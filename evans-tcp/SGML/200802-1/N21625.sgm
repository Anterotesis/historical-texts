<Q><BIBL><HI>HEBREWS</HI> XIII.17.</BIBL>
<P>FOR THEY WATCH FOR YOUR SOULS, AS THEY THAT MUST GIVE ACCOUNT.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE Author of this epi&s;tle, in his conclu&s;ion, ex|horts the Hebrews to &s;everal chri&s;tian duties; and in this ver&s;e, of which our text is a part, <HI>to obey them that have the rule over them, and &s;ubmit them&s;elves.</HI> By tho&s;e who had the rule over them, the Apo&s;tle means tho&s;e who were Pa&s;tors of the Church; being appointed over&s;eers by the Holy Gho&s;t, to lead the people in their public devotions; explain the word of God to them; to &s;peak, exhort, and rebuke, with all authority; and to admini&s;ter to the Church the &s;eals of the covenant.</P>
<P>Go&s;pel Mini&s;ters are &s;tewards of the my&s;teries of God; and when they faithfully perform their work, obedience and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion are due to them from tho&s;e whom they are &s;et over. People are bound to obey the truths preached by the Mini&s;ters of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and &s;ubmit to their in&s;tructions and leading, as far as they are agreeable to the divine rule: for Mini&s;ters have their commi&s;&s;ion and authority from the King of Heaven; hence di&s;obe|dience to them is di&s;obedience to <HI>Chri&s;t.</HI> A rea&s;on why people &s;hould obey them who have the rule over them is given in the words of our text, "For they watch for your &s;ouls, as they that mu&s;t give account." Your &s;ouls
<PB N="4" REF="028426_0003_0FD945411287BE70">
are near their hearts, and they have critical and painful work to do for them; to watch for their &s;alvation, and carefully avoid every thing in their mini&s;terial work which will hinder it. And this they do as knowing they mu&s;t hereafter give account to him, who put them into the mini&s;try, of all their conduct as Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;|pel, and what attention they have paid to your &s;ouls. Seeing then they have &s;uch a &s;olemn charge over you, and account to give, it becomes you to obey them, and &s;ubmit your&s;elves, le&s;t their account finally prove un|profitable for you, which will be the ca&s;e if they have to give up their account with grief for your di&s;obedience to the go&s;pel which they preached to you.</P>
<P>From the words of our text we may note this doc|trine, viz.</P>
<P>That Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel mu&s;t give account how they watch for &s;ouls.</P>
<P>The following remarks may illu&s;trate the doctrine.</P>
<P N="1">I. The tru&s;t committed to Mini&s;ters is very precious. It con&s;i&s;ts in the &s;ouls of men; tho&s;e rational capacities which render men &s;ubjects of moral government; with which they may &s;erve and enjoy God forever. But the &s;ouls of men, which are by nature &s;inful and expo&s;ed to eternal puni&s;hment, may be &s;aved by the go&s;pel which the Mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t preach to them: &s;ouls for whom Chri&s;t came into this world and laid down his life that a way be opened for their &s;alvation; &s;ouls who, if obedient to the go&s;pel, will forever enjoy and prai&s;e God in heav|en; but if finally di&s;obedient, will forever &s;ink under the wrath of the Almighty, and more dreadfully than if they never heard of the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t. The&s;e &s;ouls were made after the image of God, and do &s;till retain his natural image&mdash;They are to an&s;wer &s;ome very im|portant end in the divine plan, which will be attended with un&s;peakable joy or woe to the&s;e &s;ouls.</P>
<P>If Mini&s;ters have &s;uch precious things committed to
<PB N="5" REF="028426_0004_0FD94542ECB8F598">
their tru&s;t, it is evident they mu&s;t give account of the betru&s;tment to him who&s;e the property is. And <HI>all &s;ouls are God's</HI>; hence he will call for an account of his own property, which was delivered to the care of his &s;erv|ants; and e&s;pecially &s;uch valuable property as the &s;ouls of men, who are to be eternally happy or mi&s;erable.</P>
<P N="2">II. The eternal intere&s;t of &s;ouls is nearly connected with the go&s;pel which the Mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t are to preach. The go&s;pel contains that eternal life which all the &s;aved do partake in; and it is by the preaching of the go&s;pel that God &s;aves &s;inners, and builds up &s;aints in faith and holine&s;s for the heavenly world. If Mini&s;ters do not warn &s;inners, they will die in their &s;ins: and if they do not feed Chri&s;tians, with go&s;pel truths, they will not increa&s;e in knowledge under their mini&s;try. If Min|i&s;ters corrupt the word by their preaching, &s;ouls will be mi&s;led, and &s;ettle down in belief of &s;uch errors as will prove their eternal ruin. If Mini&s;ters faithfully preach the go&s;pel, Chri&s;tians will be edified and &s;trengthened in the ways of God; &s;inners may &s;ee the danger of all their fal&s;e refuges; be &s;en&s;ible of the need of Chri&s;t for their Saviour; and be influenced to comply with the terms of the go&s;pel, which are &s;et before them by the faithful preaching of it. If Mini&s;ters are faithful, the finally im|penitent, under their mini&s;try, will have no excu&s;e to make for continuing in unbelief and impenitence. They were faithfully warned, and earne&s;tly invited to Chri&s;t for &s;alvation, but would not obey. Their blood then will be upon their own heads; and their eternal puni&s;hment will be more dreadful than if they had never &s;at under the faithful mini&s;try of the go&s;pel! If &s;uch great, and eternally important things are connected with the go&s;pel being preached to men, how &s;trict will the account be which Mini&s;ters mu&s;t give to him who &s;ent them to preach the go&s;pel! If &s;uch are lo&s;t through the negligence, or corrupt preaching of Mini&s;ters, they mu&s;t give account for &s;uch conduct in their mini&s;try which
<PB N="6" REF="028426_0005_0FD945482FAF17A0">
ruined &s;ouls! why they neglected the &s;ouls under their care! why they prefered corrupt doctrine to the pure word of God! why they cho&s;e to declare <HI>&s;mooth</HI> things to &s;inners, rather than proclaim the terrors of the divine law, and precepts of the go&s;pel, which are very di&s;agree|able to &s;inners, tending to alarm their con&s;ciences and make them feel unea&s;y in hearing &s;uch truths. If Chri&s;|tians have been fed by the faithful preaching of Go&s;pel Mini&s;ters, and the finally impenitent prepared for a more dreadful puni&s;hment by it, they mu&s;t give account of &s;uch faithful preaching which has occa&s;ioned &s;uch glo|rious and dreadful effects. But it will be a joyful and happy account for &s;uch faithful Mini&s;ters.</P>
<P N="3">III. The work is very great which Mini&s;ters have to do in watching for &s;ouls; far greater than any other work men can engage in. They have to treat with &s;ouls as they are related to the Great God and Eternity. Mini&s;ters have to &s;et the Divine Character be|fore their people in its &s;criptural light. And how great a work is this! No being is to be compared with God for greatne&s;s! Before him all nations are le&s;s than no|thing and vanity. How &s;olemn will the account be which Mini&s;ters will have to give, how they treated the character of God in their preaching! Whether they &s;trictly adhered to the Revelation God has given of him&s;elf in his word concerning his natural and moral perfections, and concerning his univer&s;al government over all creatures and events, and have carefully avoided giving any feature of the Divine Character which is not clearly warranted by the word of God? Or whether they have not, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, de&s;cribed the Divine Character in &s;uch a light as is plea&s;ing to the &s;elfi&s;h feel|ings of &s;inners; and explained &s;ome of the &s;cripture de|clarations concerning God, &s;o as to &s;trip them of that maje&s;ty and terror which they wear in plain &s;cripture language; and this with a view that wicked men may feel more ea&s;y in their minds concerning God, than the Bible will allow them to feel?</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="028426_0006_0FD94549AE5DC810">Mini&s;ters have al&s;o the Law of God to &s;et before &s;in|ners. This is a very nece&s;&s;ary and important part of their work, for this is the rule of their duty toward God and man. This &s;hews the con&s;equence of di&s;obedience to its precepts, and is as important to be known as the go&s;pel: for without a right knowledge of the law a per&s;on can have no con&s;i&s;tent ideas of the Go&s;pel. The go&s;pel e&s;tabli&s;hes the divine law, and illu&s;trates its purity and ju&s;tice in the cleare&s;t light. The law &s;hews &s;in in its nature and con&s;equences; and the need &s;inners &s;tand in of the go&s;pel &s;alvation is more clearly &s;een by rightly under&s;tanding the law. No per&s;on can be a true friend to Chri&s;t and his &s;alvation, and at the &s;ame time wholly ignorant of, or an enemy to the law of God.&mdash;Here, then, is &s;olemn work for Go&s;pel Mini&s;ters. They mu&s;t give account how they watch for &s;ouls in &s;et|ting the law of God before them; whether, to plea&s;e men, they &s;aid little or nothing about the law; or what they did &s;ay was of &s;uch a nature as to bend the law down to the &s;elfi&s;h feelings of the natural heart, and &s;trip it of all its terrors, with which &s;cripture clothes it relative to tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors! or whether, in watching for &s;ouls, they have, like Paul, knowing the terrors of the law, per&s;uad|ed men, by unfolding the law in its purity, ju&s;tice, &s;trict|ne&s;s, exten&s;ivene&s;s and <HI>dreadfulne&s;s</HI> as it relates to &s;in|ners; and &s;hewing them that no thought, word or deed of theirs can be con&s;idered a conformity to the law of God, in the lea&s;t degree, while wholly de&s;titute of holy love to God and men. And whether they have thus &s;et the law before &s;inners, from a &s;incere de&s;ire for the &s;al|vation of their &s;ouls; not being influenced by the fear of offending them, on the one hand, nor from a party &s;pirit to irritate and &s;tir up their pa&s;&s;ions, on the other hand. In this great work which Mini&s;ters have to per|form, is contained the news of &s;alvation by Je&s;us Chri&s;t. This is great, important and intere&s;ting. Here they have to &s;hew that God had an eternal purpo&s;e of grace
<PB N="8" REF="028426_0007_0FD9454CA03EBED8">
for men, appointing a certain number of them to eternal life by Je&s;us Chri&s;t. The glorious character of the Re|deemer they have to de&s;cribe to men, and &s;et him before them as God-man, mediator between God and men; his atonement as the only foundation of hope for &s;inners; his doctrines, precepts, the religion which he requires of his followers; its nature and influence on the life of a Chri&s;tian. What his &s;alvation con&s;i&s;ts in; on what terms it can be enjoyed by &s;inners; and what the con&s;e|quences will be of finally neglecting to comply with the&s;e terms; the nature of the chri&s;tian Church; the charac|ter of its members; the rules for its government; and its final pro&s;perity and victory over all its enemies. A future &s;tate of rewards and puni&s;hments; a general re&s;urrection, and final judgment, are &s;ubjects for Go&s;pel Mini&s;ters to treat upon in their mini&s;try. In performing this great work, they mu&s;t give an account how they treated the various &s;ubjects of the go&s;pel. Whether they &s;trictly conformed to the &s;cripture repre&s;entation of truths in their connection and importance; or have glo&s;&s;ed them with human inventions, to plea&s;e men, and be popular in the view of the world. When treat|ing of the Saviour of men, whether they have held him up in his glorious and my&s;terious union of divine and human natures, or repre&s;ented him as a mere creature! Whether they have rightly treated of the atonement of Chri&s;t, as being nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;alvation of men; or denied its nece&s;&s;ity and wholly &s;et it a&s;ide. When &s;peaking of the &s;alvation by Chri&s;t, whether they have de&s;cribed it in its glorious reality as deliverance from <HI>moral</HI> evil, as well as natural; enjoying and &s;erving God forever in heaven; or con&s;idered it mo&s;tly as deliverance from future puni&s;hment. And whether they have en|couraged &s;inners to hope for this &s;alvation on any thing they can do &s;hort of Repentance and Faith. Whether they have in&s;i&s;ted on the nece&s;&s;ity of regeneration, that &s;inners be holy and &s;afe; and taught that it was effected
<PB N="9" REF="028426_0008_0FD9454FAFB39410">
by the &s;pecial influence of the Holy Spirit, or by the endeavours of the &s;inner.</P>
<P>Mini&s;ters mu&s;t give account, whether they have taken pains to convince &s;inners that they are wholly to blame for remaining in impenitence and unbelief; or whether they have &s;o repre&s;ented their &s;tate as tends to make them feel that they are excu&s;able for living in rejection of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Whether, in treating of Chri&s;t's reli|gion, they have carefully endeavoured to di&s;tingui&s;h it from all counterfeits, and &s;hew wherein the difference con&s;i&s;ts.</P>
<P>Mini&s;ters mu&s;t give account, whether they have care|fully fed the people of God, with whole&s;ome truths, precepts and promi&s;es, explained in a go&s;pel light. Whether they have taken pains to guard Chri&s;tians a|gain&s;t error in doctrine, and deviations from the chri&s;|tian rule in practice.</P>
<P>Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel mu&s;t give account why they entered into this great, glorious and dreadful work of the go&s;pel mini&s;try. Whether it was from love to &s;ouls; regard for the intere&s;t of Chri&s;t's kingdom in the world; and a de&s;ire of glorifying God in this line of duty: or whether it was from &s;elfi&s;h views; for the &s;ake of filthy lucre, popular applau&s;e, or any other &s;ini&s;ter motive. Whether they entered upon it with fear and trembling, from a view of the greatne&s;s of the work, and their own in&s;ufficiency to perform it; with humble, earne&s;t prayer to God for wi&s;dom, and grace rightly to engage in this work, and faithfully go through with it; or whether they paid no heed to it in this manner, and little thought of its importance and &s;olemnity.</P>
<P>Mini&s;ters mu&s;t give account, whether they have been much at the throne of grace in fervent prayer for them|&s;elves, that they may be directed in the &s;earch of divine truth; in giving the true &s;en&s;e of the &s;cripture, when they attempt to explain it to the people; be directed wi&s;ely to choo&s;e &s;ubjects for the benefit and in&s;truction
<PB N="10" REF="028426_0009_0FD94551300E6228">
of their hearers; that they may be faithful in all their work with &s;ouls, both as to preaching and living.&mdash;And whether they have earne&s;tly and hone&s;tly prayed for their people, that they may be &s;aved; that believers may increa&s;e in numbers, and grow in grace; or whe|ther they have been &s;trangers to prayer in their &s;tudies, and families, for their people. They mu&s;t give account whether they have made their work their bu&s;ine&s;s; by devoting their time to &s;tudy, and other parts of the min|i&s;terial duty; or whether they were oftener found in worldly employments than in their &s;tudy, and attending to their flocks.&mdash;Whether they have watched all oppor|tunities to do good to &s;ouls, by private vi&s;its, as they had opportunity, as well as public admini&s;trations, and make the&s;e vi&s;its &s;erve religious purpo&s;es; and in &s;ome way or other promote the intere&s;t of &s;ouls; or whether they have vi&s;ited only from worldly views.&mdash;Whether they have taken all the pains in their power with care|le&s;s &s;inners, to awaken them; with convinced &s;inners, to lead them to Chri&s;t; and with converts, to build them up in knowledge and holine&s;s.&mdash;Whether they have been diligent to warn their people again&s;t the errors in doctrine which they &s;aw them expo&s;ed to; and &s;hew them the danger of &s;uch &s;chemes of religion which plea&s;e the natural hearts of men; and have endeavoured to prove from the word of God that &s;uch religion is fal&s;e, and dangerous; and though it may offend tho&s;e who are inclined to error, yet from love to their &s;ouls have per&s;evered in beating down the&s;e &s;trong holds of Satan; or whether from fear of offending their hearers they have let them alone in their errors. Al&s;o when they have known of any wicked conduct among their people, they have borne te&s;timony again&s;t &s;uch things; exhorting the guilty to repent of all vile conduct, and reform from it; &s;hewing how ruinous to the &s;oul &s;uch things are, which the word of God condemns: or whether from fear of giving offence, they have &s;uffered their people to live in
<PB N="11" REF="028426_0010_0FD94552ACBE3D28">
known tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions without warning them.&mdash;How &s;ol|emn the account will be! And the work being &s;o <HI>great,</HI> an account mu&s;t be given how it was performed!</P>
<P N="4">IV. The work of the go&s;pel mini&s;try is attended with great difficulty, ari&s;ing from various cau&s;es; which ren|der it needful that Mini&s;ters have patience, forbearance, fortitude, fidelity, &s;kill, and a &s;pirit of holy prayer, in a right di&s;charge of the work.</P>
<P>Though the precepts and rules of the go&s;pel are plain, and intelligible; yet there are &s;ome things hard to be under&s;tood, which require clo&s;e and diligent &s;tudy, in comparing &s;cripture with &s;cripture&punc; and &s;earching for the connected meaning of &s;uch pa&s;&s;ages, le&s;t a wrong con&s;truction be given to &s;cripture, and the hearers thereby mi&s;led. Mini&s;ters then mu&s;t give ac|count how they have attended to this part of their duty, for the benefit of their flocks.</P>
<P>The work of the go&s;pel mini&s;try is very unpopular in view of a carele&s;s world; and will &s;ubject Mini&s;ters to many cen&s;ures, reproaches, and bitter words, if they are faithful to &s;inners, in &s;etting before them the truths of Revelation, which their natural hearts di&s;like. Here is a temptation for Mini&s;ters to &s;often their preaching to the ta&s;te of &s;inners, in order to live in good terms with them. Mini&s;ters then mu&s;t give account whether they patiently endured reproach, for their faithful di&s;charge of the tru&s;t committed to them; choo&s;ing rather to plea&s;e God than men: or whether, to plea&s;e men, they have daubed with untempered mortar!&mdash;No &s;erious per&s;on wi&s;hes to be an object of contempt, merely, to his fellow men; and when he is thus unju&s;tly treated, it mu&s;t be trying to his feelings. This is the ca&s;e with Mini&s;ters, when they are de&s;pi&s;ed, and rejected, for be|ing faithful to &s;ouls. Therefore they mu&s;t give ac|count, whether they prefered fidelity to popular applau&s;e, or otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>Mini&s;ters, in general, are dependent on their people
<PB N="12" REF="028426_0011_0FD9455A1E430260">
for temporal &s;upport. Their work forbids them from engaging in worldly bu&s;ine&s;s, to procure &s;upport and worldly riches for them&s;elves and families. They mu&s;t give their time to their mini&s;try; and look to them whom they &s;erve for their nece&s;&s;ary &s;upport. This is a trying circum&s;tance in their mini&s;try. For they need bread and clothing, as well as others; and the nece&s;&s;a|ries and conveniences of life are de&s;irable to them, in a rea&s;onable mea&s;ure, as well as to Chri&s;tians in a more private life: but to be dependent for the&s;e things on men, who di&s;like the truths of the go&s;pel, is, in &s;ome re&s;pects, unde&s;irable; and affords a temptation to Min|i&s;ters to &s;eek to plea&s;e wicked men, by withhold|ing plain truth from them, that they may more cheerfully contribute to their worldly &s;upport. Min|i&s;ters mu&s;t give account how they have watched for &s;ouls in this re&s;pect. Whether they have been wil|ling to &s;ubmit to inconveniences ari&s;ing from this quar|ter, for the &s;ake of being faithful to &s;ouls; or, for the &s;ake of worldly gain, have been willing their people &s;hould be ignorant of plain and important truth!</P>
<P>Mini&s;ters are men of like pa&s;&s;ions with other men; they have infirmities of body and mind; their health is often &s;o impaired as to render it very difficult to attend public admini&s;trations. Yet many people are unwilling to make excu&s;es for them on this account; when, per|haps, one half of the complaint in them&s;elves, which their Mini&s;ters labour under, would be &s;ufficient to keep them from places of public wor&s;hip. This is hard treatment.</P>
<P>Mini&s;ters mu&s;t often expo&s;e their health, in vi&s;iting the &s;ick and others of their flocks, or offend their people. This is another difficulty they have to meet with. They mu&s;t then give account, whether, in &s;uch ca&s;es, they have con&s;ulted their own ea&s;e more than duty, in &s;erving their people, or otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>Mini&s;ters al&s;o have to contend with their own &s;pir|itual
<PB N="13" REF="028426_0012_0FD9455BB078F750">
infirmities, which remain in them, as well as in other Chri&s;tians, and often cau&s;e them very &s;orrowful reflections. They are liable, like other Chri&s;tians, at times, to be off their guard, in &s;peech and behaviour, and to be led a&s;ide by temptation. They have the pa&s;&s;ions of anger, re&s;entment, grief, &amp;c. which may, in times of temptation, break forth in an unchri&s;tian man|ner, for which they are humble and penitent when they come to reflect thereon. Yet how ready are their peo|ple, often, to catch at &s;uch infirmities in them, and rai&s;e irreconcilable objections again&s;t them, on account thereof; and are wholly unwilling to make &s;uch allow|ances for their Mini&s;ters, in &s;uch ca&s;es, as they would wi&s;h to be made for them&s;elves, even in far greater de|viations from the line of duty!&mdash;Mini&s;ters, then, mu&s;t give account how they watched for &s;ouls, under &s;uch difficulties; whether they con&s;cienciou&s;ly bore te&s;timo|ny again&s;t all &s;in, even in &s;uch in&s;tances wherein they them&s;elves have been overtaken. Whether they could forgive tho&s;e who treated them with unchri&s;tian &s;ever|ity; whether they humbled them&s;elves for their &s;inful mis&s;teps, and cautiou&s;ly watched again&s;t &s;inful pa&s;&s;ions and conduct in future; or whether it were otherwi&s;e with them.</P>
<P N="5">V. Mini&s;ters have the eternal intere&s;t of their own &s;ouls involved in watching for the &s;ouls of their people. If they are unfaithful to the &s;ouls of others, they will be &s;o to their own &s;ouls: but if faithful to others, they will be &s;o to their own. If they truly &s;trive for the &s;alvation of others &s;ouls, they will for the &s;alvation of their own &s;ouls. If &s;inners peri&s;h through the &s;inful neglect of Mini&s;ters, their blood will be required at the watchman's hand. That &s;olemn and alarming pa&s;&s;age in the 3d and 33d Chapters of Ezekiel is worthy the &s;erious and abiding attention of every Go&s;pel Mini&s;ter.
<Q>So thou, O &s;on of man, I have &s;et thee a watchman unto the hou&s;e of I&s;rael; therefore thou &s;halt hear
<PB N="14" REF="028426_0013_0FD9455DB28E7D58">
the word at my mouth, and warn them from me. When I &s;ay unto the wicked man, O wicked man, thou &s;halt &s;urely die; if thou do&s;t not &s;peak to warn the wicked from his way, that wicked man &s;hall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thine hand.&mdash;Neverthele&s;s, if thou warn the wicked of his way to turn from it; if he do not turn from his way, he &s;hall die in his iniquity; but thou ha&s;t delivered thy &s;oul.</Q>&mdash;Here we &s;ee how nearly connected with his work a Mini&s;ter's own intere&s;t is. If &s;inners peri&s;h, through his unfaithfulne&s;s, their blood is to be required of his hands. He mu&s;t be accountable for their death, as far as it was owing to his neglect to warn them faith|fully. But if he di&s;charges his duty with fidelity, he is &s;afe, though &s;inners peri&s;h whom he warned.&mdash;When the Apo&s;tle Paul took his leave of the Elders of the Church at Ephe&s;us, he &s;aid unto them,
<Q>Wherefore I take you to record this day, that I am pure from the blood of all men. For I have not &s;hunned to declare unto you all the coun&s;el of God.</Q>
He felt him&s;elf clear from the guilt of any man's final ruin to whom he had preached; from this con&s;ideration, that he had not &s;hunned to declare unto them all the coun&s;el of God. Therefore it was not through his fault, or neglect, that any of his hearers were finally lo&s;t. And it implies, that if he had &s;hunned to declare all the coun&s;el of God to tho&s;e whom God &s;ent him to preach the go&s;pel to, and they had peri&s;hed, he could not be pure from their blood. So that his own &s;alvation was involved in his faithfully watching for &s;ouls.</P>
<P>The Apo&s;tle Paul exhorts Timothy to take heed to <HI>him&s;elf,</HI> as well as to the doctrine, for in doing this, he would &s;ave <HI>him&s;elf</HI> and tho&s;e who heard him. Mini&s;ters have to watch over their own hearts, and lives, in watching for &s;ouls; and &s;ee that they love and live the religion of Chri&s;t, which they preach to others. Paul &s;aid he did thus, he kept his body under, and brought
<PB N="15" REF="028426_0014_0FD9456090DFCB30">
it into &s;ubjection, le&s;t when he had preached to others he him&s;elf &s;hould be a ca&s;taway. Which implies, that Mini&s;ters who have no true religion them&s;elves will be lo&s;t. Nor can they faithfully watch for &s;ouls, if they take no care to maintain a life of religion before their people. A true Mini&s;ter of Je&s;us Chri&s;t is a man of true religion; and he will &s;trive to be faithful in his preaching and per&s;onal religion. Therefore Mini&s;ters mu&s;t give account how they watched for &s;ouls with re|lation to their own &s;alvation.</P>
<P N="6">VI. Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel have their commi&s;&s;ion and charge to preach the go&s;pel from Je&s;us Chri&s;t. He qualifies them with gifts and grace for the work. He &s;ends them forth, in his providence, to preach to &s;ouls. They are put into office by the rule of Chri&s;t in his word. They are bound to preach the truth which Chri&s;t has revealed to men. God has committed to them the word of reconciliation; they are amba&s;&s;adors for Chri&s;t, and in his &s;tead to pray men to be reconciled to God. They are Mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t, and &s;tewards of the my&s;teries of God. Con&s;equently they mu&s;t give ac|count to him, who made them over&s;eers of the flock of God, and &s;tewards of his word, whether they have &s;trict|ly conformed to the rule, given them by their Great Lord and Ma&s;ter, in preaching to &s;aints and &s;inners; not daring to add any thing of human invention; or leave out any part of the go&s;pel, through de&s;ign to plea&s;e men. Whether they have endeavoured, all in their power, to under&s;tand the errand which they are &s;ent upon, and plead the cau&s;e of their Ma&s;ter. When they have been treating with the enemies of Chri&s;t, whe|ther they hone&s;tly &s;tood up for their Lord, his word and kingdom, or &s;hamefully betrayed their tru&s;t, by &s;iding with his enemies; allowing their objections to be true, and ju&s;t, which they make again&s;t God, his govern|ment, and religion; and ju&s;tified the enemies of Chri&s;t, in their refu&s;al immediately to &s;ubmit to him; by &s;et|ting
<PB N="16" REF="028426_0015_0FD9456335D4DA70">
them to do many things previou&s;ly to their repent|ing, and &s;ubmitting them&s;elves to their Sovereign, whom they ought to obey and love con&s;tantly. The lea&s;t deviation from the rule of Chri&s;t, in watching for &s;ouls, is going a&s;ide from the commi&s;&s;ion and authority which he has committed to their tru&s;t; and they mu&s;t give account of it to their Lord; and &s;o of all their work, whether faithful or unfaithful.</P>
<P N="7">VII. The glory of God is the great end of the go&s;pel mini&s;try, as well as other parts of God's plan; and Min|i&s;ters of the Go&s;pel mu&s;t &s;o watch for &s;ouls as to honour God. In preaching divine truth, God is &s;et on high, as before ob&s;erved. It is for his honour, for Mini&s;ters to preach to their people tho&s;e plain, clo&s;e, uncorrupted truths which God has revealed in his word. It is for the glory of God, that &s;inners are brought to embrace the go&s;pel, and be &s;aved: that &s;aints are, by the faithful preaching of the go&s;pel, built up in chri&s;tian knowledge and holine&s;s; and that the finally impenitent are ren|dered more inexcu&s;able, by attending to the faithful min|i&s;try of the go&s;pel. Mini&s;ters then mu&s;t give account, whether they have regarded the honour of God, or not, in this work. Whether, in their reading, praying, preaching and living, they have had a &s;acred regard for the Divine Being; and de&s;ire that they may glorify him, in all their mini&s;terial work; and be in&s;trumental in leading &s;inners to honour and plea&s;e God. Whether, for the honour of God, they have borne te&s;timony a|gain&s;t all vile conduct among their people; or &s;uch as their people have been expo&s;ed to el&s;ewhere, and they may be knowing to. Whether, for the honour of God, they have endeavoured to &s;top the mouths of gain&s;ayers, and refute the errors and corrupt opinions of men con|cerning the word of God. Whether they have, for the honour of God, pled for the rules and order of Chri&s;t's hou&s;e, and &s;hewn the importance of Chri&s;tians walking agreeably thereto. Whether, for the glory of God,
<PB N="17" REF="028426_0016_0FD945658BC35A40">
they have per&s;evered in pleading for his cau&s;e, truth and religion, when they have been hated, reviled and abu&s;ed; and refu&s;ed to yield to the unrea&s;onable de&s;ires of men, relative to their &s;olemn covenant engagements; or whether they have had no regard for the honour of God, in any part of their mini&s;try!</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="improvement">
<HEAD>IMPROVEMENT.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. We infer from this &s;ubject, the importance that Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel be men of ability, knowledge, and real religion. Without the&s;e they cannot be qual|ified for the go&s;pel mini&s;try. Men cannot perform this great work of watching for &s;ouls, if they are de&s;titute of knowledge and grace. Tho&s;e who have no talent for in&s;truction, and exhortation, are not fit for the mini&s;|try. Nor are tho&s;e who are ignorant men, not ac|quainted with letters, in any con&s;iderable degree. Nor tho&s;e, who are ignorant of the doctrines of the bible, and the nature of true religion. How can men teach &s;ouls the important truths they ought to know, if they have no knowledge of truth them&s;elves? And how can men who have no true religion be faithful guides to &s;ouls? Such know not the &s;piritual ta&s;te of real Chri&s;tians, nor how to feed them &s;uitably to their char|acters. Unholy men are not engaged for the &s;alvation of &s;ouls; nor the honour of the Great Redeemer. They may preach truths, but they do not love divine truth.</P>
<P N="2">2. If Mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel mu&s;t give account how they watch for &s;ouls, we may learn how cautiou&s;ly they ought to enter upon &s;uch a great and &s;olemn work. With what &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s, attention, examination and prayer, &s;hould they exerci&s;e them&s;elves before they dare venture forth in &s;uch an important and dangerous field! They &s;hould be &s;atisfied, from good evidence, that God has qualified them with gifts, knowledge, and grace, for this &s;olemn work; that they may not mi&s;lead &s;ouls; ruin them&s;elves; and di&s;honour God.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="18" REF="028426_0017_0FD94569938E39C0">3. This &s;ubject may lead us to reflect on the great difference between the accounts of the faithful and un|faithful Mini&s;ters of the word. Tho&s;e who loved the truth, lived the religion of Chri&s;t, and hone&s;tly preached his go&s;pel, will meet the approbation of their Lord, &s;aying, Well done! good and faithful &s;ervants, enter ye into the joy of your Lord! On the other hand, tho&s;e who have been deceitful workers, corrupt|ers or neglecters of the truth, enemies to the religion of Chri&s;t, unfaithful to &s;ouls and the cau&s;e of the Re|deemer, mu&s;t meet with a dreadful frown from the Great Judge of the World, &s;aying, Go ye wicked and &s;lothful &s;ervants into outer darkne&s;s, bound hand and foot! The faithful Mini&s;ter will be approved by his Judge, in the great day, and glorious in heaven forever, though numbers to whom he preached are eternally lo&s;t! He is free from their blood, having been faith|ful to them! And the unfaithful Mini&s;ter mu&s;t &s;ink down, mo&s;t dreadfully, under the wrath of the Almigh|ty, with tho&s;e whom he mi&s;led in his mini&s;try, and was criminally in&s;trumental in their ruin! Who can trifle with &s;o &s;olemn a work as the go&s;pel mini&s;try! How can a man feel ea&s;y in his mind, when he has evidence that he was always an enemy to the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, which he pretends to declare to others! And how can he be content to make &s;elf and wordly intere&s;t his prin|cipal end, in entering on this work! Do &s;uch think how dreadful an account they are preparing for the day of Judgment? How pale and trembling will unfaith|ful Mini&s;ters meet their people at the bar of God! to &s;ee tho&s;e, who&s;e &s;ouls they undertook to watch for, lo&s;t through their negligence and unfaithfulne&s;s! remem|bering what corrupt &s;entiments they taught them; with what &s;elfi&s;h arguments they per&s;uaded them to embrace a fal&s;e religion; and reject the &s;ound doctrines of the bible, and holy religion of the Redeemer. All their corrupt, &s;elf-plea&s;ing &s;ermons will be exhibited to
<PB N="19" REF="028426_0018_0FD9456AD4633148">
view in that day! All the exhortations and directions they gave to &s;inners, which encouraged them to re&s;t &s;hort of Chri&s;t, in their impenitence, hoping to be ac|cepted at la&s;t, will then be rehear&s;ed in their true mean|ing. And the mi&s;erable &s;ouls, who were &s;o fooli&s;h as to be deluded by &s;uch unfaithful dealing, will appear before them, as evidences of their guilt in ruining their &s;ouls! How dreadful is the thought concerning the account of unfaithful Mini&s;ters! On the other hand, how joyful will be the appearance of the faithful &s;erv|ants of Je&s;us Chri&s;t! The go&s;pel truths they delivered in their &s;ermons; the clo&s;e applications; the warm ex|hortations; and the earne&s;t entreaties with &s;inners, to repent and believe; will then be mentioned in their favour. And they will &s;ee all their flocks, to whom they mini&s;tered in this world: the children of God, whom they were in&s;trumental in &s;aving, comforted by the truths they heard at &s;uch and &s;uch a time, and warned from their mi&s;takes and wrong &s;teps, will ap|pear before them as their crown of rejoicing! And tho&s;e of their people, who refu&s;ed to obey the truth which they preached to them, will be pre&s;ent, al&s;o, and remember the times their Mini&s;ters warned them to re|pent and believe, which they refu&s;ed to comply with. Now they find true what their faithful guides told them; that except they repented in time they would be lo&s;t forever! But the faithful Mini&s;ter is clear; their blood will be upon their own heads!</P>
<P N="4">4. Learn from this &s;ubject, how &s;olemn and weighty the connection is between a Mini&s;ter of the Go&s;pel and his people. They have cho&s;en him to the mo&s;t impor|tant &s;ervice a mortal can do for them; and he has taken upon him the mo&s;t weighty charge he <HI>can</HI> take. The connection being &s;o &s;olemn, a Mini&s;ter ought, from a full conviction or his duty, to take the over&s;ight of a flock, and never wi&s;h for a di&s;&s;olution of his connection with them, except fully &s;atisfied that duty requires it. Small,
<PB N="20" REF="028426_0019_0FD9456DC0DE07D8">
trifling matters &s;hould never influence him to quit his &s;olemn charge. So with the people, they ought to look well whom they choo&s;e to be &s;et over them as their &s;pir|itual guide; as to his natural, acquired, and gracious qualifications. That he is &s;ound in the faith; will feed them with knowledge and under&s;tanding; and will be willing to &s;pend and be &s;pent for the good of their &s;ouls. And if they have &s;uch a one given them by the great Head of the Church, they ought very highly to prize him, for his works &s;ake, and hold him in reputation. No &s;mall affair &s;hould influence them to part with &s;uch a me&s;&s;enger from <HI>the LORD of Ho&s;ts.</HI> A true and faithful Mini&s;ter of Christ is endeavouring to &s;erve his people, in their be&s;t intere&s;ts. How careful &s;hould they be, that they do not hinder his u&s;efulne&s;s among them! Much is required of a people toward their Mini&s;ter, that he may profit them. They mu&s;t pray much for him; provide for his comfort; be very friendly to him at all times; put the be&s;t con&s;truction on all he &s;ays and does, privately and publicly, which ca&s;es will admit of. Never grieve him by oppo&s;ing the truths he delivers; nor by cen&s;uring him for his faith|fulne&s;s, in bearing te&s;timony again&s;t their bad conduct. Nor try to hurt his influence among his people, by pre|judicing their minds again&s;t him, relative to his doc|trine or conduct. If a Mini&s;ter is guilty of error in any of his &s;ermons; or unchri&s;tian &s;teps in his conduct; he is entitled to the privilege of the rules of Chri&s;t's hou&s;e; to be tried thereby; and his people ought never to re|ject him, till they have found him guilty upon trial. How can a people know that their Mini&s;ter will not give them chri&s;tian &s;atisfaction, if they deal with him according to go&s;pel rule? And po&s;&s;ibly, upon exam|ination, it may appear that he has not tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed, as they &s;uppo&s;ed him to have done. And if they have accu&s;ed and condemned him without trial, and thus hindered his u&s;efulne&s;s, how great mu&s;t their guilt be!
<PB N="21" REF="028426_0020_0FD945715DAC8AD8">
They have injured their own &s;ouls, and the &s;ouls of others, by de&s;troying the influence of one whom God approves of as faithful; and al&s;o grieving a friend and &s;ervant of Je&s;us Chri&s;t! Such people ought to remem|ber the &s;olemn words of the Lord Je&s;us, "He that de&s;pi&s;eth you, de&s;pi&s;eth me; and he that de&s;pi&s;eth me, de&s;pi&s;eth him that &s;ent me." Chri&s;t is here &s;peaking of tho&s;e whom he &s;ent forth to preach the go&s;pel to men; and we &s;ee how dreadful it is to de&s;pi&s;e them! Their crime does not &s;top again&s;t the Mini&s;ter, whom they de&s;pi&s;e; but reaches to Chri&s;t, and the Father. The Son of God and eternal Father are de&s;pi&s;ed! How great mu&s;t their guilt be, who are &s;eeking all the ad|vantage they po&s;&s;ibly can, to prejudice the minds of others again&s;t their Mini&s;ter! Some will prejudice their children again&s;t their Mini&s;ter, by often, in their pre&s;|ence, oppo&s;ing the doctrines he preaches, without giv|ing any &s;cripture proof of their being un&s;ound. And thus their children drink in an unju&s;t prejudice again&s;t the truths they hear from their Mini&s;ter, and receive no benefit from his mini&s;try; all his in&s;tructions are in vain to &s;uch per&s;ons; and they may die in &s;uch preju|dice to the truth, and peri&s;h forever. Dreadful thought for parents! If a people, by their unkind and unchri&s;|tian treatment of a Mini&s;ter of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, &s;hould &s;o far prevail as to de&s;troy his influence among his people, that a &s;eparation from them becomes nece&s;&s;ary, how dreadful is the &s;in of &s;uch a people! They do de&s;pi&s;e Chri&s;t, and in effect pray him to depart from them; and they have awful rea&s;on to fear he will leave them without any &s;piritual guide at all; or &s;end them one who will pervert the truth, and lead them on to endle&s;s ruin. The connection then between Mini&s;ters and people is mo&s;t important.</P>
<P N="5">5. We may infer from the &s;ubject, that people who have rejected a faithful watchman, will have a mo&s;t dreadful account to give in the great day; that is, if
<PB N="22" REF="028426_0021_0FD945722F887118">
they die impenitent for &s;uch rejection. They and their Mini&s;ter mu&s;t meet again; but it will be at the bar of God, where nothing but truth will be admitted. No plea will avail there, which is not con&s;i&s;tent with the commands of God, and religion of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. It will not then do to plead, they did not like the Mini&s;|ter's &s;entiments, provided they are &s;ound, according to the bible; nor to plead, they &s;urmi&s;ed him to be irregu|lar in &s;ome of his conduct. If they have treated him contrary to the rules of the go&s;pel, and thus been in|fluential to de&s;troy his u&s;efulne&s;s, they mu&s;t an&s;wer for it on that dreadful day of account. How confounded will they be to hear the Judge approve of the faithful min|i&s;try of his &s;ervants, whom their people rejected; and even of tho&s;e very things they rejected them for! How &s;olemn their account concerning their own &s;ouls! Why are they not &s;aved? They had warning from the Min|i&s;ters of Chri&s;t. The particular &s;abbaths, lectures, and private interviews with their Mini&s;ters, will all be brought into view. The particular &s;ermons, the truths which were delivered, the exhortations and entreaties to repent and believe, will all be mentioned then; with the arguments which were u&s;ed to urge a compliance with the go&s;pel. What then can be &s;aid in defence of rejecting &s;alvation by Chri&s;t? To &s;ay then, as often they do in this world, they &s;uppo&s;ed the Mini&s;ter was angry; had a party &s;pirit; and the like; will not avail with them. If he faithfully warned them, they ought to have received the warning, and repented.&mdash;But &s;ome never take pains to hear what the watchman has to &s;ay for the good of their &s;ouls, at lea&s;t, very &s;eldom attend. Chri&s;t &s;ent a me&s;&s;enger to them, to in&s;truct them in their duty; but they would not hear what he had to &s;ay to them. They had opportunity to attend, but cho&s;e to neglect it. They e&s;teemed it a great calamity to have &s;uch a one among them; and wi&s;hed to be rid of him. Are &s;uch per&s;ons friendly to their own &s;ouls?
<PB N="23" REF="028426_0022_0FD94573F590DC30">
Are they friendly to Chri&s;t? It is impo&s;&s;ible! For they &s;in again&s;t Chri&s;t, in refu&s;ing to hear whom he &s;ends to them; and he who &s;ins again&s;t Chri&s;t wrongs his own &s;oul.</P>
<P N="6">6. Let us now apply this &s;ubject more particularly to this pre&s;ent &s;olemn occa&s;ion; an occa&s;ion the mo&s;t &s;ol|emn, in &s;ome re&s;pects, I was ever called to attend to.</P>
<P>In compliance with the free invitation of this Church, and People, I was, nine years ago, &s;et a watchman over you, to watch for your &s;ouls; for which I mu&s;t &s;hortly give account. My mini&s;terial connection with you is now di&s;&s;olved; being reque&s;ted by the town. I am no more your watchman as heretofore. I have not that particular charge of your &s;ouls, which I once had. And though it is po&s;&s;ible &s;ome of you may hear me preach again, yet not as your Mini&s;ter, as once I was. But this is not the la&s;t meeting we are to have together. The mo&s;t &s;olemn meeting we can have, is yet future. It will be at the bar of God; where we &s;hall &s;ee each other, and know that we once had an important con|nection together as Mini&s;ter and People! Then will be mentioned the means which led to this connection; and tho&s;e al&s;o which led to a di&s;&s;olution of it; with all the circum&s;tances attending us, from my fir&s;t preaching to you, to this clo&s;ing &s;ermon. You mu&s;t give ac|count of your motives in inviting me to &s;ettle with you; and of all your mea&s;ures in bringing about &s;uch a connection. I mu&s;t give account of my motives in accepting your invitation; and all my public and pri|vate conduct towards you &s;ince, as your Mini&s;ter. You mu&s;t give account of the parts you have taken, in tho&s;e mea&s;ures adopted by the town, in di&s;&s;olving this union. And I mu&s;t give account of every thing I have done in this &s;olemn affair, till a di&s;&s;olution took place. As to my mini&s;try here, I have a mo&s;t &s;olemn account to give, whether I have prayerfully endeavoured to be

faithful to your &s;ouls, in &s;tudying, preaching, warning, reproving, exhorting, vi&s;iting, and living religion. Though I have many failings in the cour&s;e of my min|i&s;try to bewail before God; yet, I humbly tru&s;t, through infinitely &s;overeign grace, I &s;hall appear pure from the blood of all your &s;ouls, which have been com|mitted to my care. But for this I rely upon the mercy of God alone, through the great Redeemer. From a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of duty, I have relinqui&s;hed my mini&s;try here; yet I may po&s;&s;ibly be mi&s;taken, and have gone a&s;ide from duty.</P>
<P>Let me, my Chri&s;tian Friends, addre&s;s a few words to you on this occa&s;ion, particularly the CHURCH in this place. With you, as a body, I have walked in fel|low&s;hip for a number of years; but am no more your Pa&s;tor, to admini&s;ter common and &s;pecial ordinances to you; and it is probable we &s;hall never more &s;it together at the table of the Lord in this world. But, my friends, we mu&s;t meet again in another world, and there remember all the &s;olemn &s;cenes we pa&s;&s;ed through in this world. I mu&s;t give account how I have treated you, as a part of the vi&s;ible &s;pou&s;e of Je&s;us Chri&s;t; of all the methods I have taken to lead you as your Pa&s;|tor, with my motives in taking the over&s;ight of you. Whether I have faithfully endeavoured to feed you with the good and whole&s;ome truths of Revelation, free from human invention: Whether I have plainly laid before you the marks of the real Chri&s;tian; and faithfully ex|horted you to examine whether the&s;e marks could be found upon you. Or whether I have &s;o de&s;cribed the Chri&s;tian, as was calculated to deceive you, and cau&s;e you to hope without &s;ufficient grounds. Whether I have hone&s;tly endeavoured to watch over the Church, and warn them of danger from errors in doctrine, and deviations from the rule of duty in conduct. Whether I have &s;et before you the order of Chri&s;t's hou&s;e, as revealed in the &s;cripture, and &s;hewn you the importance
<PB N="25" REF="028426_0024_0FD9457AF11EA560">
of &s;trictly complying therewith. Whether I have been cautious and careful in the examination of candidates for church communion; not daring to encourage any to come, who did not give me &s;ome rea&s;on to believe they were &s;ubjects of &s;aving grace, though I may be de|ceived concerning them. Whether I have pitied you under all your trials and temptations, which have come to my knowledge, and endeavoured to give you all that in&s;truction and comfort in my power. Whether I have rejoiced to &s;ee you appearing at any time to maintain the honour of Chri&s;t's cau&s;e, by an holy life, and love to the doctrines of the go&s;pel: and, on the other hand, mourned to &s;ee a different appearance in any of you. And whether I have daily borne you on my heart at the throne of grace, that you may grow in chri&s;tian knowledge and grace, and all finally be &s;aved.&mdash;O what a &s;olemn account have I to give to him who made me an over&s;eer over this Church of God! And, my friends, have not <HI>you</HI> al&s;o a very &s;olemn account to give in this connection? If your Pa&s;tor has been faithful, mu&s;t you not give account how you have improved under his mini&s;try? But if he has been unfaithful, mu&s;t you not give account whether you have treated him as the go&s;|pel rule requires of you? Yes, <HI>you</HI> mu&s;t all give ac|count of your thoughts, words, and conduct towards your Pa&s;tor. Whether you have loved him, pitied him under trials, prayed for him, and tried all in your power to &s;trengthen his hands. Whether you have carefully avoided &s;aying or doing any thing which could weaken his mini&s;terial influence among this people; and refu&s;ed to receive an accu&s;ation again&s;t him but before two or three witne&s;&s;es.&mdash;And relative to this &s;olemn &s;epara|tion, which has now taken place, you mu&s;t give account whether you were aiding in it; or endeavoured by all chri&s;tian &s;teps to prevent it. Whether you have never &s;hewn oppo&s;ition to any of the truths your Pa&s;tor has preached; and thus &s;trengthened the hands of the en|emy.
<PB N="26" REF="028426_0025_0FD9457CB2D1B460">
Whether any of you have had your ears open to the tattle of the vain world, and been ready to believe idle reports without examination. Whether you have had your minds cooled towards your Pa&s;tor from mere hear&s;ay, without ever knowing whether or not they were true. And whether you have never given a mi&s;repre|&s;entation of facts, by means of which, others have been troubled in their minds. And, in a word, you mu&s;t give account whether you have endeavoured at all times to treat your Pa&s;tor as an Amba&s;&s;ador from Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>May God, of his free gace, through Je&s;us Chri&s;t, par|don all our &s;ins we have been guilty of towards each other, as Pa&s;tor and Church! And I pray God to build you up in the faith and order of the go&s;pel; and enable you to keep up a &s;trict watch over one another in the Lord; and may we finally meet in the heavenly world, where chri&s;tian friends will never more part!</P>
<P>I would now &s;ay a few words to the CONGREGATION, not particularly of the Church. I am now about to take my leave of you, as your Mini&s;ter; perhaps never more to preach the go&s;pel to you. But we mu&s;t give account of the opportunities we have had together in this connection: <HI>I</HI> of my preaching; <HI>you</HI> of your hear|ing, or refu&s;ing to hear. I mu&s;t &s;oon give account of all my treatment of you in my mini&s;terial connection with you; and, if I have been faithful, the account will be joyful for me; but dreadful for you, if you have not been faithful to your own &s;ouls. From <HI>you,</HI> as a town, my di&s;mi&s;&s;ion was occa&s;ioned. <HI>You</HI> de&s;ired me to re|linqui&s;h my mini&s;try in this place. <HI>You</HI> have refu&s;ed to give rea&s;ons for this de&s;ire; and <HI>you</HI> have al&s;o refu&s;ed to have this &s;olemn affair examined by an Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Council. But, a Council, called by the Pa&s;tor and Church, have advi&s;ed to a di&s;mi&s;&s;ion, which has now taken place. But, my friends, the affair is not to end thus: all the&s;e tran&s;actions are regi&s;tered in the
<PB N="27" REF="028426_0026_0FD9458048EE06A8">
Court of Heaven, to be brought out to public view be|fore the a&s;&s;embled univer&s;e! <HI>You</HI> and <HI>I</HI> &s;hall then have a very &s;olemn meeting! <HI>Then</HI> I &s;hall hear the rea&s;ons why you pre&s;&s;ed for a di&s;mi&s;&s;ion from my mini&s;try, as you have done. Chri&s;t is perfectly acquainted with them; and he will &s;tate them plainly, that all the world may know them! <HI>Then</HI> you <HI>cannot</HI> keep them out of hearing. And are you &s;ure they are &s;uch as the impar|tial Judge will approve of?</P>
<P>Relative to this &s;olemn affair, I mu&s;t give account of every &s;tep I have taken in it. Why I &s;o much in|&s;i&s;ted upon order and regularity in &s;uch a &s;erious affair, which we have been attending to. Whether it was from &s;elfi&s;h views, or from a regard to the order of the Churches, and the &s;olemn charge of your &s;ouls. <HI>You</HI> mu&s;t give account whether it were from covetou&s;ne&s;s, you refu&s;ed a Council; or from a full conviction that &s;uch a &s;tep would be contrary to the laws of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Should any individuals in this town think them&s;elves free from this &s;olemn account, becau&s;e they have not acted on either &s;ide, but remained neuters through the whole; let &s;uch remember, they mu&s;t give account why they have not acted in this &s;olemn and important affair. Al|though you have not voted for, or again&s;t; or, in view of the world, taken &s;ides in the late &s;truggles concern|ing your Mini&s;ter; yet your minds have certainly been decidedly on one &s;ide or the other; and you know what &s;ide you wi&s;hed might prevail. There is no &s;uch thing as the mind being neuter towards oppo&s;ing cau&s;es which it attends to. Chri&s;t &s;ays, "He that is not <HI>with</HI> me is <HI>again&s;t</HI> me."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matt. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">ii.3<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE> And you have, at heart, been either <HI>for</HI> or <HI>again&s;t</HI> your Mini&s;ter. If you believed his preach|ing and conduct to be &s;uch as rendered him worthy of contempt and rejection from this people; you mu&s;t give account why you have not boldly, for the cau&s;e or reli|gion, exerted your&s;elves to remove him from his mini&s;|try
<PB N="28" REF="028426_0027_0FD94581EC9A6178">
here, agreeably to go&s;pel rule. But if you believe that he has endeavoured to be hone&s;t and faithful in his mini&s;terial charge; you mu&s;t give a dreadful account for withholding your help, when you &s;aw him abu&s;ed and per&s;ecuted by his oppo&s;ers! The&s;e things are nearly con|nected with the cau&s;e of God. And is not <HI>his</HI> cau&s;e worthy your taking an active part in? The Angel of the Lord pronounced a bitter cur&s;e again&s;t tho&s;e, who came not to the help of the Lord again&s;t the mighty.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Judges, v. 23.</NOTE> And how can you feel ea&s;y in your minds, when you know you have not come forth to the help of the Lord in this place? Another day will di&s;clo&s;e your views and motives in neglecting to be active in this &s;olemn affair. Tho&s;e who have di&s;liked my preaching, mu&s;t give ac|count whether they had good rea&s;on to believe that I did not preach the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t truly, and profitably for hone&s;t minds: or whether the truths delivered, did not apply too clo&s;ely to them, condemn their conduct which they cho&s;e to indulge; and yet unable to &s;ay that any thing was ever delivered contrary to the bible in its connection.</P>
<P>It is to be feared that &s;ome of you, who have &s;at under my mini&s;try, are &s;till in your &s;ins; never complied with the invitations of the go&s;pel which have been &s;et be|fore you; and it is likely I may never have any more op|portunities to warn you of your danger. Let me tell you, once more, O &s;inners, that if you go on till death in your impenitence and unbelief, you will forever &s;ink down under the wrath of the Almighty; and all the in|&s;tructions and warnings you have had, will &s;erve to ag|gravate your dreadful puni&s;hment! You will remember all the calls and warnings you have had from tho&s;e whom God &s;ent to you in the name of Chri&s;t. And now you are free from your Mini&s;ter, and from any more public warnings from him, as your Mini&s;ter; what will be the event is known only to him who governs all
<PB N="29" REF="028426_0028_0FD94585706EF0E8">
things. How &s;ad will be your ca&s;e, if you never have any more warnings from God by his &s;ervants! You may be given up to choo&s;e corrupt preaching, which plea&s;es the natural heart; and that will ruin you. Or you may be left to the choice of no wor&s;hip at all; this al&s;o will de&s;troy you. Therefore repent <HI>now</HI>; choo&s;e Chri&s;t, and his religion, and you will be happy forever. And if you as a people truly humble your&s;elves before God for all your &s;ins, he may yet build you up.</P>
<P>If here are any who have been under &s;erious impre&s;|&s;ions from what they have heard under my mini&s;try, and are returning again to vanity; I have one word to &s;ay to you. The time is coming when it will appear whe|ther you were affected by <HI>truth</HI> which you heard, or not; and why you can now feel cold towards &s;uch things as once made you tremble. If you once believed that your Mini&s;ter preached truth, which was &s;olemn and important, why do you now treat the &s;ame kind of preaching with neglect? Are you <HI>now</HI> &s;ure that what you <HI>once</HI> thought to be true is fal&s;e?</P>
<P>I have now done with you <HI>all,</HI> perhaps, forever! I may never preach to you again; at lea&s;t I am no more your Mini&s;ter! Have I been faithful to you? Have you been faithful to your own &s;ouls? Will there not be a dread|ful &s;eparation among us, another day?&mdash;May God ena|ble all of us to repent of all our &s;ins; believe in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and live a holy life; then we &s;hall have a happy meeting together in a better world!</P>

<P>The Rev. Mr. <HI>Bradford,</HI> and <HI>Nicholas Pike,</HI> E&s;q. be|ing nece&s;&s;arily ab&s;ent.</P>
<P>Having &s;upplicated the divine pre&s;ence and direction, the Council proceeded to bu&s;ine&s;s. And from all the information re&s;pecting the unhappy &s;ituation of this town, which they have been able to collect from the &s;tatement made by Mr. Cleaveland; from the informa|tion given by a Committee of the Church, cho&s;en for the purpo&s;e; and from the votes of the Town, properly atte&s;ted; it appears to this Council,</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="31" REF="028426_0030_0FD9458A2EF48200">1. That Mr. Cleaveland's influence among this peo|ple is lo&s;t, and irrecoverably lo&s;t; and that it has be|come nece&s;&s;ary that his mini&s;terial connection with them be di&s;&s;olved: And it is the advice of this Council that he a&s;k a di&s;mi&s;&s;ion from his pa&s;toral relation to them.</P>
<P N="2">2. It appears, from the fulle&s;t, and, they tru&s;t, the mo&s;t impartial examination of the &s;ubject, of which they are capable, that Mr. Cleaveland has given no ju&s;t cau&s;e for that aver&s;ion and oppo&s;ition to him, which, in &s;o <HI>violent</HI> and very <HI>unprecedented</HI> a manner, they have di&s;|played.</P>
<P N="3">3. It appears to this Council, that Mr. Cleaveland's moral, chri&s;tian and mini&s;terial characters &s;tand fairly, and firmly &s;upported; and they cordially recommend him to the church and people of God, wherever, in di|vine providence, he may be ca&s;t.</P>
<P N="4">4. As Mr. Cleaveland has given to this people no ju&s;t cau&s;e for that oppo&s;ition to him, which they di&s;cover, and which renders his removal from them nece&s;&s;ary; and as his removal mu&s;t be attended by great inconve|nience and expen&s;e to him; it is the opinion of this Council, that he ought to receive a compen&s;ation: And they recommend it to the parties concerned, to choo&s;e mutually three judicious, impartial characters from &s;ome of the neighbouring Towns, to e&s;timate the damage to which Mr. Cleaveland is &s;ubjected by his removal.</P>
<P N="5">5. That the Selectmen of the Town be &s;ea&s;onably furni&s;hed with an atte&s;ted copy of this Re&s;ult.</P>
<P>Finally, the Council, deeply impre&s;&s;ed with the &s;in|gular &s;acrifice which Mr. Cleaveland's friends make, in parting with their valuable and beloved Pa&s;tor, beg leave to exhort them to acknowledge the hand of God in this affecting providence, as becomes Chri&s;tians; to maintain the order of Chri&s;t's hou&s;e; and with unre|mitting ardour promote the intere&s;t of his kingdom.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="028426_0031_0FD9458D319BDFF8">And now, brethren, we commend you to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance among them that are &s;anctified.</P>
