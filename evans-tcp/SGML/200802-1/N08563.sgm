<P>THE chief De&s;ign of our Exi&s;tence, is high and noble; worthy of a God

to have, in making his Creature Man, and of our utmo&s;t attention and &s;olicitude to reach unto it. As God, in his Works, could not have an higher End, than his own Glory, and his Creature's good; we are not in all our Life and Service, to &s;top at a lower; but, ever keep it in view, to ri&s;e up unto it, in the exerci&s;es of Re|ligion, that excellent and important Bu&s;i|ne&s;s a&s;&s;igned us; which, it &s;eems, even the apo&s;tacy of Man, and malice of Satan; is not an irremoveable Bar in the Way of: When; &s;overeign Grace in Chri&s;t, has open'd the Way of our recovery unto it, and the happine&s;s connected with it. Re|ligion then, thus revives in the World, and Heaven again opens to View; accord|ing to the Go&s;pel of God our Saviour, which brings life and immortality to light. I &s;ay, this Bu&s;ine&s;s, is yet to occupy the chief Room in the whole cour&s;e of our life here, that it may gloriou&s;ly fill an Eternity hereafter. But for which, how could it have been worth while for Man to exi&s;t, that rational, con&s;cious Creature, that he is; capable of a connexion and communion with God.</P>
<P>BUT, how &s;hort a Time has Man, as a probationer for a better State of exi&s;tence?
<PB N="5" REF="010950_0005_0F8530810DBBDE80">
which, the Apo&s;tle in our Text, appears to have a clear and affecting View of; as he counted &s;hortly to put off the Tabernacle of the fle&s;h; and have done preaching the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, that delightful Bu&s;ine&s;s of the better part of his Life. Man's Life is <HI>&s;oon cut off;</HI> and <HI>he flys away</HI> to yonder World of Spi|rits&mdash;So that, the whole run of Bu&s;ine&s;s here, of this and that kind; is &s;hort, and &s;oon over, with Time; which, ha&s;tens to an end. But, &s;hort as Time is, (always on the wing,) it is long enough to reach unto, and introduce Eternity; which, cer|tainly follows upon the &s;horte&s;t Life that is. We therefore, had need be early adorn'd with God's Image, and the Savi|our's Righteou&s;ne&s;s; and by the Grace of God, fill up our Time well; to be ready for the important Change of States and Worlds for ever. The very Thing, the Apo&s;tle pre&s;&s;ed in the cour&s;e of his Mini|&s;try, and experienc'd in the Ca&s;e of his own Soul. And, while we are &s;pared in Life; may it be, as <HI>God &s;pareth a Son to &s;erve him.</HI> For, it is a forfeited Life, that is &s;pared&punc; which carries in it, the greater obligation on us, to &s;pend it well, as the fruit of having dedicated it, and our &s;elves unto God.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="010950_0006_0F853081CF6EC288">
VERY ju&s;tly may each one of us &s;ay; <HI>having obtained help of God, I continue unto this Day.</HI> Yea, in the mid&s;t of di&s;|ea&s;es, dangers and deaths; and that, which is more; notwith&s;tanding all our Offences. For, if in any &s;ingle Moment, God had withdrawn his Care, in that Moment, we had retired from Life.</P>
<P>BUT, more e&s;pecially, may I adopt the Words, <HI>having obtained help,</HI> &amp;c. with an animated Gratitude, to the great <HI>Pre&s;er|ver of Men: who in the riches of his for|bearance,</HI> hath continued me, (through many Years infirmity in former Life, and many &s;cenes of heavy Trial in the greater part of Life) into the <HI>Seventy-fourth</HI> Year of my Age; with confirmed Health, in &s;ome late Years. A rare In&s;tance of &s;ignal Mercy. <HI>A Wonder to many,</HI> mo&s;t ju&s;tly &s;o to <HI>my &s;elf:</HI> more e&s;pecially, as through Grace, I have been carried along to the completion of half a Century, in the Mi|ni&s;try&mdash;<HI>Selah</HI>&mdash;Pau&s;e a little here, Oh my Soul; and acknowledge him in all this, who is <HI>glorious in Holine&s;s, fearful in Prai&s;es, doing Wonders.</HI></P>
<P>AND now ju&s;tly looking forward to the clo&s;e of my Life and Mini&s;try; which is gathering in apace upon me: And, with
<PB N="7" REF="010950_0007_0F85308667155B18">
this argument before me; to animate me, by the grace of God, to fill up the re&s;i|due of my Days, with the important Bu&s;i|ne&s;s of Religion and of my Station; I have thought it my Duty, to take this public Notice of God's great Goodne&s;s, in con|tinuing me in &s;ome Mea&s;ure capable of public Bu&s;ine&s;s, to &s;o remarkable a Period. A kind of <HI>Jubilee</HI> for rejoicing in the di|vine Goodne&s;s; and for Liberty yet to &s;erve the mo&s;t High in his Church. Verily, this Day, is <Q>Witne&s;s for God that he is good, and doeth good.</Q> This Day, the la&s;t Sabbath of the <HI>Fiftieth</HI> Year in Office; may be noted indeed, as an <HI>Ebenezer,</HI> indicating that <HI>hitherto the Lord hath helped me:</HI> And may &s;erve both as a Memorial, and Monitor unto me. I &s;ay, a <HI>Remembrancer</HI> of God's Mercy to me, and a <HI>Monitor</HI> of my Obligation to him; to be indeed, more than ever devo|ted to his Service. With which view, I have cho&s;en the Words read, to improve to the Glory of God, and to my own Advantage and your's.</P>
<P>THIS Apo&s;tle, who in his &s;econd Epi&s;tle, in&s;erts the&s;e important, affecting Pa&s;&s;ages, which I have read; had been faithful in <HI>preaching</HI> the very go&s;pel, &s;o worthy of

their Attention and Remembrance; to whom he <HI>wrote.</HI> And then, he didn't think he had done enough, without <HI>re|minding</HI> them of the&s;e Things; and doing all that was proper to <HI>fix</HI> them in their Minds for la&s;ting Profit: And therefore, &s;ays, <Q>I will not be negligent always to put you in Remembrance of the&s;e Things:</Q> The very Doctrines, and great Things of the Go&s;pel, which he had delivered to them. And they (&s;ome of them) had a good knowledge of, and at pre&s;ent appeared well e&s;tabli&s;hed in them; yet, this, he thinks to be the Work of his remaining Days, to be bringing them to their Remembrance; and one great Ar|gument, he had to excite him unto it; was his View of the &s;mall remains of Life now before him, and &s;wift approach of Death, which, by revelation had been &s;hewed him. And therefore, adds, a pathetic <Q><HI>Moreover,</HI> I will endeavour that you may be able after my decea&s;e, to have the&s;e Things always in Remembrance,</Q> i. e. as long as they &s;hould live after him; they might, by his faithfulne&s;s to them now, be profit|ed by them; yea, carry the good favour thereof, to their own Grave, and find the un&s;peakable Benefit of it, beyond all Time.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="010950_0009_0F8530880BC5CF28">
Whence, I collect the&s;e OBSERVATIONS.</P>
<P>I. 'TIS the Character of a good Mini&s;ter of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and faithful in his Ser|vice; to be in the cour&s;e of his Mini&s;try, preaching the <HI>great Doctrines and Duties</HI> of the Go&s;pel: in&s;i&s;ting chiefly <HI>on them</HI> for the &s;aving good of Men's Souls.</P>
<P>II. WHEN he hath done this, in his for|mer Mini&s;try; yet, he is not to neglect proper Means to refre&s;h their Memories herewith, to impre&s;s them deep on their Hearts.</P>
<P>III. HE is accordingly to fill up the re&s;i|due of his Days, very much to this Purpo&s;e. And,</P>
<P>IV. FROM this Con&s;ideration, that he cannot live long to do this Service. And,</P>
<P>V. FOR this End, are Mini&s;ters to exert them&s;elves; that their Hearers may reap the Advantage of it after their decea&s;e.</P>
<P>I. I ob&s;erve, 'tis the Character of a good Mini&s;ter of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and faithful in his Service; to be in the Cour&s;e of his Mini&s;try, preaching the great <HI>Doctrines</HI> and <HI>Duties of the Go&s;pel,</HI> in&s;i&s;ting chiefly on them for the &s;aving good of Men's Souls.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="010950_0010_0F85308898591BC8">
THE Apo&s;tle <HI>Peter,</HI> as al&s;o <HI>Paul</HI> and others did &s;o. When, God had <Q>put them into the Mini&s;try, as counting them faithful,</Q> they &s;pent their Life in it. And &s;o have others, down to this Day; who were of the right Stamp: <Q>giving them&s;elves, (as charg'd) to reading and meditation, on tho&s;e Things,</Q> which be|long to the important Bu&s;ine&s;s of their Office; <Q>&s;tudying to &s;hew them&s;elves approved of God,</Q> and unto Men's Con&s;ciences; <Q>as Workmen that need not to be a&s;ha|med, rightly dividing the Word of Truth;</Q> which is yet, and always will be the Character of true and faithful Mi|ni&s;ters of the Go&s;pel. Our Apo&s;tle here, in what is &s;aid of him, in his Epi&s;tles, is a good Pattern indeed, for imitation, through all Ages.</P>
<P>IN his fir&s;t Epi&s;tle he di&s;cour&s;eth of the great <HI>Doctrines of Grace</HI>&mdash;of <HI>Prede&s;tination</HI> unto Life, <Q>according to the fore-know|lege of God the Father, through &s;anctifi|cation of the Spirit unto obedience, and &s;prinkling of the Blood of Chri&s;t.</Q> ver. 2.&mdash;of <HI>Regeneration</HI> by the Spirit of God, as the &s;ole Author; while the Word is the well cho&s;en and appointed Means thereof: as here declared to be <Q>according to his
<PB N="11" REF="010950_0011_0F8530895973A7D0">
abundant Mercy, that he hath begotten us again unto a lively hope, by the Re|&s;urrection of Chri&s;t from the dead.</Q> v. 3. to the &s;ame Purpo&s;e with that mo&s;t expre&s;s pa&s;&s;age in Jam. 1. 18. <Q>Of his own Will begat he us, with the Word of Truth.</Q>&mdash;And of <HI>Per&s;everance</HI> unto Life; as is declared in v. 4, 5. that the Regenerate <Q>who are born to an heavenly Inheritance, are kept by the mighty Power of God, through Faith unto Salvation.</Q>&mdash;And this we find al&s;o; in his preaching the im|portant Doctrines of the Go&s;pel; that he omits not, but in&s;i&s;ts upon the <HI>&s;acrifice of Chri&s;t, upon the Cro&s;s,</HI> the all-availing Me|rit of his whole obedience; for our <HI>Ju&s;ti|fication</HI> unto Life, &s;ee ver. 11, 19.</P>
<P>As al&s;o the great <HI>Duties of the Go&s;pel,</HI> are what he much inculcates. As, that Chri&s;|tians <Q>do gird up the Loins of their Minds, be &s;ober and hope to the End, for the Grace, that is to be brought to them, at the revelation of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. As obe|dient Children, not fa&s;hioning them&s;elves according to the former Lu&s;ts, in their Ignorance; but, as he which hath cal|led them is holy; &s;o that they be holy in all Manner of Conver&s;ation and God|line&s;s; pa&s;&s;ing the Time of their Sojour|ning
<PB N="12" REF="010950_0012_0F85308A1DA320B0">
here in fear.</Q> ver. 13,&mdash;17. And if we look through his whole fir&s;t Epi&s;tle into this; where, he &s;peaks particularly of <Q><HI>The Righteou&s;ne&s;s of God, and our Soviour Je|&s;us Chri&s;t;</HI> which becomes our's by a precious Faith.</Q> And where he parti|cularly pre&s;&s;eth <HI>Diligence,</HI> in <Q>adding to Faith Vertue, and to Vertue Know|lege;</Q> and &s;o on to the completion of the Chri&s;tian Character. And &s;o, to <Q>make our Calling and Election &s;ure.</Q>&mdash;I &s;ay, if we view, what he has wrote clear thr&ocirc; we &s;hall find, what important <HI>Doctrines</HI> and <HI>Duties,</HI> he in&s;i&s;ted on; wherein, all faithful Mini&s;ters, will in &s;ome good Mea|&s;ure follow him: Yes; all &s;uch, will preach up free Grace&mdash;Chri&s;t Crucified&mdash;and Faith in him, &amp;c.&mdash;Hence,</P>
<P>II. I OBSERVE, that when the faithful Mini&s;ter of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, hath done this, in his former Mini&s;try; &s;till, he doth by no Means, neglect proper Steps, to remind his People of the&s;e Things; for their deeper Impre&s;&s;ion on their Hearts. It was &s;o, with the Apo&s;tle, when he had preached the great Doctrines, and urged the great Du|ties of the Go&s;pel; and &s;hown the va&s;t Importance of them, with re&s;pect to pre|&s;ent Comfort, and future Happine&s;s; He
<PB N="13" REF="010950_0013_0F85308AD10F1890">
don't think, he had done enough; but &s;ays, as in the Text; <Q>Wherefore, I will not be negligent to put, you always in re|membrance of the&s;e Things.</Q>&mdash;<HI>Where|fore;</HI> that is, becau&s;e of the great Impor|tance and Nece&s;&s;ity of the&s;e Things, which I have taught in the Cour&s;e of my Mini&s;try heretofore; "I will not be Negligent,"&mdash;No; nothing &s;hall make me &s;o; nothing &s;hall divert me from my duty, not any worldly Views and Motives; nor &s;hall any Thing which mine Enemies throw in my Way, as an embarra&s;ment to my Work; di&s;courage me: Nor yet, that which looks the mo&s;t Plau&s;ible by way of Excu&s;e, to relax my Care in this Matter: (<ABBR>viz.</ABBR>) that "you do know the&s;e Things" already; and appear to be <Q>e&s;tabli&s;hed, in the pre|&s;ent Truth,</Q> the labouring Truths of the Day; yet, I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of the&s;e Things: But will be frequently refre&s;hing your Me|mories with them; and &s;o endeavour by all Means, to keep the&s;e Things with you, to confirm you more and more in the faith of the Go&s;pel, and practice of Chri&s;tianity.</P>
<P>So, faithful Mini&s;ters to this Day, (as it is the Character of &s;uch,) will not only, by preaching &s;ound Doctrine to their Hearers,
<PB N="14" REF="010950_0014_0F85308B93374408">
endeavour to in&s;truct them well in the very Things of God, that they may know them well, and be e&s;tabli&s;hed therein, <Q>in the Faith once delivered to the Saints,</Q> &amp;c.&mdash;But, and though many of them, may al|ready know them well, and profe&s;s to be well e&s;tabli&s;hed in them; they will yet in&s;i&s;t upon them over, and over; with fre&s;h Il|lu&s;trations and Arguments, and every Way, they can properly take; be putting them in Remembrance hereof.</P>
<P>III. I OBSERVE, that the faithful Mi|ni&s;ter, who hath &s;erved long already, is to fill up the re&s;idue of his Days much to this purpo&s;e: Reminding his People of the im|portant Things, they have been taught. "I think it meet" (&s;ays the Apo&s;tle) fit and highly proper, <Q>as long as I am in this Tabernacle, to &s;tir you up, by put|ting you in Remembrance.</Q> As if he had &s;aid, Upon the mo&s;t &s;erious review of the Duty of my Office, of the importance of tho&s;e Things, I have taught you, and of your receiving them to &s;aving Profit; it is my &s;ettled Thought and Re&s;olution; that as long as I live, I will exert my &s;elf to ex|cite you, unto a fre&s;h a&s;&s;ent to the Truth, by a mo&s;t impre&s;&s;ive Review of the excel|lence and worth thereof, that you might
<PB N="15" REF="010950_0015_0F85308C5200F688">
better than ever yield Obedience unto it; that <Q>you might not lo&s;e, (or &s;eem to lo&s;e) what you have gained,</Q> nor, any way fail of a right Chri&s;tian &s;tedfa&s;tne&s;s in Faith and Duty. What the Apo&s;tle was after, by all his Pains in this Matter, was, that they be thorough, per&s;evering Chri&s;tians, and be excited abundantly to <Q>exerci&s;e them&s;elves unto Godline&s;s.</Q></P>
<P>AND thus, will faithful Mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t, in all Ages of the Church, do; not be content with preaching up moral Ver|tue, Self-Government, Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and Charity; but in&s;i&s;t much on the Subjects of chri&s;tian Revelation, as <HI>Paul,</HI> who would e&s;pecially preach <Q>Chri&s;t and him Cruci|fied.</Q> They will enter into the Marrow of the Go&s;pel, and dwell much upon the Words of Chri&s;t, that "are Spirit and Life." They will e&s;teem it fitting and nece&s;&s;ary, that as long as they live, and can do it, to preach often upon Subjects of the greate&s;t Moment, and thereby be exciting their People to "obey the Truth:" (and more and more &s;o,) in which con&s;i&s;ts the Life of Religion. Oh; this "doing the Truth" as St. John expre&s;&s;es it, is what Crowns all, <Q>If ye know the&s;e Things happy are ye if ye do them.</Q> Tho&s;e who have
<PB N="16" REF="010950_0016_0F85308D14D13D28">
&s;ome good Under&s;tanding of the Principles of Religion, and appear well &s;et in the Practice thereof; do yet need <Q>Line upon Line, to &s;tir them up, even their pure Minds by Way of Remembrance,</Q> in Order to better Practice.</P>
<P>IV. I OBSERVE that Mini&s;ters are to be faithful in all their Duty, from the Con|&s;ideration of the &s;canty Mea&s;ure of their Opportunities for it; that they are not to live long, e&s;pecially, when the mo&s;t of their Day is gone already. And &s;o, will have but a little Time for this Service. Hence &s;ays the Apo&s;tle, <Q>I think it meet, as long as I am in this Tabernacle to &s;tir you up&mdash;knowing that <HI>&s;hortly</HI> I mu&s;t put off this Tabernacle, as the Lord Je&s;us hath &s;hewed me.</Q> Some have had &s;trange premonitions of their Death, the near approach of it: But, there was &s;omething more &s;pecial in the Ca&s;e of <HI>Peter;</HI> the Lord Je&s;us had &s;hewed him above 30 Years before, the <HI>Manner,</HI> if not the <HI>Time</HI> of his Death&mdash;See Joh. 21. 18, 19.&mdash;<Q>When thou &s;halt be old, thou &s;halt &s;tretch forth thy Hand, &amp;c. This &s;pake he, &s;ignifying by what Death he &s;hould glorify God.</Q> That is, by dying on the Cro&s;s, in which, he was to follow Chri&s;t, die as he did; he
<PB N="17" REF="010950_0017_0F85308DD46F6A30">
was, in the Day, when Chri&s;t &s;pake the&s;e Words to him, very confident, that he could follow Chri&s;t any where, even to Death. This was Self-confidence, and failed him; that, in&s;tead of <HI>dying</HI> with Chri&s;t, he <HI>deny'd</HI> him over and over, before Chri&s;t came to die him&s;elf: But <HI>Peter</HI> re|pents of this; and after his Recovery, has a better kind of Confidence and Courage: &s;o that, when called to &s;uffer <HI>Martyrdom</HI> for Chri&s;t, as the Lord told him he &s;hould, <HI>he &s;tretched forth his Hands,</HI> freely yielded to be Crucified, which was at <HI>Rome,</HI> under the cruel Per&s;ecution of <HI>Nero,</HI> but a little after he wrote the&s;e Epi&s;tles; Anno Dom. 65. or 66. For then he was grown old, when the Lord Je&s;us &s;aid he &s;hould be Crucified. So that he might well &s;ay now, "I mu&s;t &s;hortly put off this Tabernacle." 'Tis ob&s;erv'd by Hi&s;torians, the exact Time is not a&s;certain'd, but, by all Accounts, might not be far from 67. or 68. and &s;ome &s;ay, at the &s;ame Time, yea, the very Day, that <HI>Paul</HI> was beheaded there, by <HI>Nero,</HI> for converting one of his Concubines to the Chri&s;tian Faith. Which Death, <HI>he</HI> might have &s;ome previous Warning of, or at lea&s;t, of the near approach of Death, in &s;ome Form; when he &s;ays, <HI>The Time of my

<P>THUS faithful Mini&s;ters &s;ince; in the View of their uncertain, but &s;hort Stay at the longe&s;t, may well be excited to Dili|gence in their Ma&s;ter's Work: e&s;pecially, if they have liv'd long already: as their old Age then, (without a &s;pecial Revelation from the Lord Je&s;us) &s;peaks the near Ap|proach of their Death, When a Mini&s;ter is far advanced in Life, to Three-&s;core Years and Ten, or more, he mu&s;t needs know, that &s;hortly, he &s;hall put off this Tabernacle; and re&s;ign Office and Life; and all Opportunity here, of doing good.

IT is the Character, and will be the Pra|ctice, of faithful Mini&s;ters, to exert them|&s;elves, in Study and Diligence, in all the Exerci&s;es of their Office, that they can; <Q>to fulfil the Mini&s;try which they have received of the Lord Je&s;us.</Q> And en|deavour to the la&s;t, the be&s;t good of their Charge.

<P>V. FOR this End, are Mini&s;ters to ex|ert them&s;elves, and the faithful will do &s;o; that their Hearers may reap the Advantage of it, after their Decea&s;e.

<PB N="20" REF="010950_0020_0F85309373B2CD60">
indeed is the Ca&s;e here. Not enough (it &s;eems) that People know, and are e&s;ta|bli&s;h'd in the Truth: To be &s;ure, not enough that they have a &s;peculative View of it, and have a rational Belief of it; but, they mu&s;t Remember it; have it always ready, as <HI>Food</HI> to feed upon con&s;tantly, and as a <HI>Rule</HI> always to live by. They mu&s;t attend to it, not for pre&s;ent Amu&s;ement, or to be plea&s;ed ju&s;t while they are hearing a good Sermon; but attend to it, as <HI>Lydia</HI> did to the Things &s;poken by <HI>Paul;</HI> attend to the very Important Things &s;poken of, with a View of having them impre&s;t on their Minds, fix'd there, for la&s;ting Good; which, you &s;ee the Apo&s;tle was greatly concerned about: and therefore, in&s;i&s;ts upon it here, as he doth. <Q>I <HI>will not</HI> be negligent,</Q> (a &s;trong way of expre&s;&s;ing his Care in this Matter) <Q>to put you al|ways in Remembrance of the&s;e Things.</Q> Again, <Q>I think it meet, as long as I am in this Tabernacle, to &s;tir you up, by putting you in Remembrance;</Q> ah, and exert my &s;elf in this; becau&s;e, I know, that in a little Time I can do it no more; Therefore, while I live, <Q>I will endeavour that you be able, after my Decea&s;e, to have the&s;e Things always in your Remem|brance.</Q>

Thus, he dwells upon the Sub|ject, as a very main Thing with him, and what &s;hould be &s;o with us; el&s;e we read and hear, as if we did it not; nor were like to be the better. The Apo&s;tle, (it &s;eems) in the very decline of Life, ju&s;t as he was fini&s;hing his Mini&s;try, was laying in greatly for the future Advantage of Men's Souls; that, when he was dead and gone, they might be able to have tho&s;e Things in Remembrance, which they had heard. And &s;o always, as long as they liv'd after him, be reaping the good of his Sermons and Epi&s;tles.</P>
<P>THUS, faithful Mini&s;ters now, the near|er they come to the fini&s;hing their Cour&s;e; will be the more concern'd for the Salva|tion of their dear Charge; that after their Decea&s;e, their Hearers, may be able to re|collect what they have been taught; have it pre&s;ent with them, and fix'd in their Minds to their be&s;t and la&s;ting Advantage; (that is) well grounded in Faith and Love, never to be <Q>moved away, from the hope of the Go&s;pel.</Q> Therefore, they will Pray and Preach, Conver&s;e and Live, in a good Mea&s;ure as Per&s;ons looking into E|ternity.

and as much per&s;picuity and openne&s;s to Men's Under&s;tandings, as they can: &s;peak with Pathos and Concern to have the&s;e Things well receiv'd and fix'd in their Minds, and their Faith in them E&s;tabli&s;h'd,&mdash;This, good Mini&s;ters love to &s;ee much of, and of the probability of its exi&s;ting after they are gone. Oh, how careful that their People do not for&s;ake the right Ways of the Lord, that they be not Wavering, and driven to and fro, by every Wind of Doctrine, after their Decea&s;e; but by an exemplary Soundne&s;s in the Faith, be hap|pily &s;ecure from Declen&s;ion in any Thing of Religion; or true Comfort and the Peace of religious Society and Chri&s;tian Communion. It was very Affecting to St. Paul, what he told his Hearers, and knew, <ABBR>viz,</ABBR> <Q>That after his Departure, grievous Wolves wou'd enter in among them not &s;paring the Flock, and that of their own &s;elves, would Men ari&s;e, &s;peaking per|ver&s;e Things, to draw away Di&s;ciples after them.</Q> See Acts 20, 29, 30. But, yet he would do all he could, (to prevent this as much as might be,) in not &s;hunning to declare the whole Coun&s;el of God. As he &s;ays in v. 27.&mdash;And &s;o <HI>Peter</HI> would do, all he could, that People

might have what he taught them, always in Remembrance: To continue &s;ound in the Faith, and &s;tedfa&s;t in the Order of the Go&s;pel.&mdash;</P>
<P>AND thus faithful Mini&s;ters down to this Day, will Study hard, Pray earne&s;tly, Preach clearly and powerfully; yea, Con|ver&s;e and Argue, and do all they can, to in&s;truct the People in the very Truth, as it is in Je&s;us; the very Faith and In&s;tituti|ons of the Go&s;pel, and to e&s;tabli&s;h them therein; by having all that done for them, which, by the ble&s;&s;ing of God &s;hall enable them to have the Things of God and Je&s;us Chri&s;t, always in Remembrance; as the Matter of their Faith, and Guide of their Practice, from Generation to Generation; that, a right Scriptural Religion, and Go&s;|pel Order, may live on, to all &s;ucceeding Time.

Scarce any Man's Life &s;o clo&s;ely fill'd up with Duty and Exerci&s;e; not only of the &s;tated Wor&s;hip of God in Public, with diligent Reading and Study to prepare for that; but much of a more private Kind, vi&s;iting the Di&s;tre&s;&s;ed in their various Sor|rows; one <HI>Sick</HI> here, and another <HI>Dying</HI> there, and many Ca&s;es of Individuals to attend unto; that it may be eminently &s;aid of a Mini&s;ter's Work, that <HI>'tis never done,</HI> as long as he lives, and is capable of it; and that old Age, will not excu&s;e him from Application; while God keeps up his Ca|pacity for it.&mdash;His Work is great <HI>all his Life through,</HI> as he is to be <Q>giving him|&s;elf wholly to the&s;e Things,</Q> which be|long to the mini&s;terial Office, that he may <Q>fulfil the Mini&s;try, he has received of the Lord Je&s;us,</Q> in&s;tructing Men truly in the great Points of Religion, and labouring both their Edification and E&s;tabli&s;hment in the Truth, &amp;c.

Thus, tho' <Q>his Beginning was Small, to have his latter End greatly Increa&s;ed</Q> is Glorious: And even in
<PB N="25" REF="010950_0025_0F853096D5763F58">
his clo&s;ing Days, he mu&s;t not be negligent to put his People in Remembrance of tho&s;e Things, they have heard; in&s;i&s;t upon them over and over, with new Illu&s;trations and more Proof, to fix them deep in their Minds; and &s;o to &s;tir them up mo&s;t effec|tually to the Chri&s;tian Life: Yea, endea|vour by all Means, they have the&s;e Things always in Remembrance, ready at Hand, for their own per&s;onal Benefit, and for the Defence of the Truth again&s;t Gain&s;ayers.

<P>II. USE. WE learn from the Premi&s;es, the great Duty of tho&s;e that live under the Go&s;pel, to attend faithfully to the preach|ing of it. If Mini&s;ters mu&s;t give them|&s;elves to this Work, and be all the Time

faithful in it; who then may, for trifling Excu&s;es, forbear to attend unto a preached Go&s;pel, or be inattentive to it, when they do attend. If the Mini&s;ter mu&s;t not, by any Means, be negligent to put his People always in Remembrance of pure Go&s;pel; but it is of &s;o much Worth to them, that he mu&s;t be always &s;etting it before them, as long as he lives; that they may not fail of the Benefit of it, when he can &s;peak no more to them? then &s;urely, it claims their mo&s;t diligent Attention now, to have it ever with them. Oh think of it, with re&s;pect to the Doctrine of free-forgivene&s;s of Sin, and Ju&s;tification unto Life, by the all-avail|ing Atonement, and perfect Obedience of Chri&s;t. May this be di&s;regarded? Is this ever to be forgotten? or wholly out of Mind one Day? Can we pa&s;s a Day with|out Sin? and what they do, one Day with|out a Saviour, and unle&s;s we have the&s;e Things always in Remembrance? Very worthy then, of our Attention, with the View of laying them up in our Mind and Heart: Yes, &s;urely; if the Apo&s;tle in the clo&s;e of Life; when his Thoughts would be &s;o full of his own per&s;onal Concerns; gathering in all needful Comfort in the View of Death; I &s;ay, if yet he e&s;teem it

Certainly then, this teacheth People to attend con&s;tantly and well on the Word preached; and to hear, as for their Lives; while they may; and with a View of their reaping the Advantage of it, after their Mini&s;ter is gone from the Pulpit, to the Grave.</P>
<P>III. USE. WE hence learn, that 'tis a vain Curio&s;ity which excites in People, an Itch of hearing <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> always, &s;omething New; either as <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> the Matter or Mode: Something <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> is <HI>Novel,</HI> without proper Regard <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>Truth,</HI> to <HI>Sub&s;tance,</HI> and <HI>Impor|tance.</HI> Indeed, to hear one Thing over and over, in Sermons, continually, in a &s;hort round of Sentiments; though they be Sound and Weighty, is not fitting; and can't reli&s;h well; when the Field is Wide, and many very important Things are to be
<PB N="28" REF="010950_0028_0F85309929E60F18">
&s;poken: And de&s;irable it is, to have a va|riety of Subjects, within the Compa&s;s of Orthodoxy and great Moment; and well handled. Yet, (I &s;ay,) to have &s;uch a Thir&s;t for Novelty, as not to Care, whe|ther what we hear, be <HI>True,</HI> if it be but <HI>New,</HI> or to nau&s;eate old Truths, meerly becau&s;e we have heard them, and known them before; is very wrong; and favours much of a vain Mind. The Apo&s;tle &s;up|po&s;eth Men to know the Truth, and to be e&s;tabli&s;hed therein; and yet, to need being "put in Remembrance thereof." Men of pure Minds, may need, and be greatly Profited by this. So that, an Itch for new Things, for the &s;ake of Novelty, is a vain Curio&s;ity. Our Text will ju&s;tify a Preach|er's in&s;i&s;ting much upon what the Apo&s;tle means by <HI>the&s;e Things,</HI> the&s;e important Doctrines, &amp;c. which are to be <HI>brought to Remembrance;</HI> and going over with them again and again, in the Cour&s;e of his Mi|ni&s;try; But, the <HI>more</HI> with new turns of Thought and Expre&s;&s;ion, to the &s;ame Pur|po&s;e; to rivet the&s;e Things in Men's Minds; and the <HI>more</HI> with new illu&s;trations and enforcements of the Subjects, to give them a more lively Impre&s;&s;ion on the Heart; <HI>the better.</HI> This is all well: and what
<PB N="29" REF="010950_0029_0F853099D04999F8">
the Apo&s;tle intends, by putting Men that had heard the Go&s;pel, always in Remem|brance of the &s;ame Things for Sub&s;tance; which they had known and believed before.</P>
<P>IV. USE. If there be &s;o much Stre&s;s laid upon putting People in Remembrance of the important Things, they had heard; that the Apo&s;tle thought it meet to do it, as long as he lived; and however much he had done at in&s;tructing them well, in the Cour&s;e of his Mini&s;try; yet, and in the clo&s;e of his Life, to make it his Bu&s;ine&s;s, to put them in Remembrance of the&s;e Things; then it follows, as a ju&s;t Infer|renee, that there are many, who, after a Sort, hear them now; that think little of their Excellence, and of the va&s;t Importance of their attending duly unto them, to lay them up for their Advantage hereafter. I &s;ay, think little of this, through the long Day of their Opportunity; ah, little of this, till their Day is over, not only for hearing them, from this, or that Mini&s;ter; but for attending to them at all. For, they let the Candle of their Life, under the Means of Grace, &s;weal away, by their own abu&s;e and neglect thereof. O how reprehen&s;ory and awakning is this? that the Apo&s;tle,
<PB N="30" REF="010950_0030_0F85309AD9EC90F0">
in the &s;hort Time he had to live, before he mu&s;t &s;uffer Martyrdom, and die on the Cro&s;s; I &s;ay, the &s;hort Time he had now, when old; to think of this, and have his own Heart well brac'd up to meet it; and be in the mo&s;t ample readine&s;s for Heaven: That yet, even then, he wou'd endeavour by all Means, that others, after his Decea&s;e, always have the&s;e Things in Remembrance, to their own everla&s;ting Advantage. Verily it reproves, and may ju&s;tly &s;tartle &s;uch, as do yet, after all Means u&s;ed with them, <HI>neglect the great Salvation,</HI> and &s;tupidly &s;pend their Life in Sin; or in worldly Con|cerns, to the neglect of <HI>the one Thing need|ful.</HI></P>
<P>V. USE. WE &s;ee here, what is one great End of all good Preaching the Word, and Writing on divine Subjects: It is, <HI>to excite Men to right Practice,</HI> the Apo&s;tle's Aim in all he &s;aid and wrote; in&s;tructing People in the Truth, and putting them in Remembrance of tho&s;e Things which they had been taught; was <HI>to &s;tir them up,</HI> to their Duty, to receive the Truth mo&s;t fully into their Hearts, and obey it in all Things; to excite in them a ju&s;t Concern, to be approved of God as the upright. Yea, he neglected not to &s;tir up the pure&s;t Minds
<PB N="31" REF="010950_0031_0F85309B5F445178">
by way of Remembrance: to put them upon exerci&s;ing them&s;elves unto Godline&s;s in all the lovely Branches of it; to love God &s;upremely, to love the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t in &s;implicity, and mo&s;t exemplary godly &s;ince|rity; and to love one another fervently; and thus, <HI>fulfil the Law of Chri&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>WELL now, having giv'n &s;ome Account, from our Text, of the Duty of Chri&s;t's Mini&s;ters, in the Cour&s;e of their Mini&s;try to be in&s;i&s;ting on the great Doctrines and Duties of the Go&s;pel: and yet in the clo&s;e of their Life, to be putting People in Re|membrance of the&s;e Things. May I not on this Occa&s;ion, in the FIRST PLACE, humbly &s;ay, That through the Grace of God, <HI>I have not &s;hunned</HI> <Q>to declare the whole Coun&s;el of God unto you.</Q> Are you not my Witne&s;&s;es, that in &s;ome good Mea|&s;ure, I have preach'd both <HI>the Law</HI> and <HI>the Go&s;pel,</HI> in their Place, and with their Views. The <HI>Law</HI> as the great Means of convincing Men of their Sin and Mi&s;ery; as by it, is <HI>the knowlege of Sin.</HI> And as the Rule of Life, the obligations of which, being Moral and of perpetual Force, yet lie upon us; and in this View, fitted to give Men con|viction of <HI>Sin;</HI> as <HI>that,</HI> is the want of Con|formity unto, and Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion thereof:&mdash;

The Rea&s;ons to urge me to Faithfulne&s;s in this, are chiefly the Glory of God and your Salvation; which are intimately concerned herein.

<P>FOR AS MUCH then, as it is my Duty, in &s;ome Imitation of the Apo&s;tle, to &s;tir up your Minds, (even the pure&s;t of them) by Way of Remembrance of the&s;e Things, to fix and e&s;tabli&s;h you well in them; you will &s;uffer me to Remark upon the Impor|tance of <HI>this Remembrance,</HI> which is a Kind of <HI>Capital Word,</HI> in Scripture; much u&s;ed there, as expre&s;&s;ing what is of great Con|&s;equence.</P>

I will abundantly ble&s;s her Provi&s;ion, I will &s;atisfy her Poor with Bread.&mdash;You will then &s;uffer me to go on with my Advice to the Congregation at large; and &s;ay, Acquaint now thy &s;elf with God, one and all, and be at Peace, thereby <HI>good &s;hall come unto thee;</HI> all <HI>the good</HI> of Peace.&mdash;Peace with God, Peace of Con&s;ci|ence,&mdash;and Peace among your &s;elves. Oh how Glorious thus to be at Peace? Yea, to be engaged, in ear|ne&s;t, to pur&s;ue, and happily po&s;&s;e&s;s mutual Love and E&s;teem; abiding Harmony, and Peace in Community, Civil and Religious. As repre&s;ented in P&s;al. 133. Behold how good and how Plea&s;ant it is, for Brethren to dwell together in Unity: It is like the precious Ointment u&s;ed for a &s;acred Officer of old; of &s;weet Perfume. And as the Dew de|&s;cending upon the Mountains of Zi|on, to refre&s;h them,&mdash;for there the Lord commandeth the Ble&s;&s;ing:

<HI>good indeed,</HI> to be of this Di&s;po&s;ition, and in that Situation, where the eter|nal God, the great Father of Ble&s;|&s;ing, doth command it, ah and that, which in the End, doth come to be Life for ever-more. This is glorious indeed; &s;ome Re&s;emblance of Heaven.</Q>&mdash;</P>
<P>Now, whatever failure of this mutual E&s;teem, Love and Peace, &amp;c. there hath ever been here; God &s;aw it, and was much Di&s;plea&s;ed with it: and you have been the Sufferers. And in whatever Degree, this chri&s;tian Affection and Har|mony hath &s;ince been, and now is; God is Witne&s;s, and approves of it; who&s;e Approbation it is, that determines the Worth of any Thing in, and among us, and done by us, plea&s;ing unto him. But whatever Peace and good Agree|ment, we now live in: <Q>Still the Advice is, be more and more intent upon it; to live in Love and Peace, always following Holine&s;s with it.</Q></P>
<P>LOVE, and Peace! of what impor|tance and &s;acred Worth is this? it is honoured with God's having a Chara|cter

to this Purpo&s;e, God is Love. The God of Peace: and Chri&s;t, he is our Peace: And Peace it &s;elf comprehends all good. As in Joh. 14. 27. <Q>My Peace I give unto you,</Q> that is every Thing: Yea, put for the Crown of all that is called good. As expre&s;s'd in that glorious Benediction&mdash;<Q>Grace, Mercy, and Peace be multiplied to you.</Q> So, let it be now, and here|after &s;o let it be, through my Days, and all &s;ucceeding Generations, for e|ver.</P>
