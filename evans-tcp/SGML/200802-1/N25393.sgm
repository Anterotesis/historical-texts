<Q>SO THIS DANIEL PROSPERED IN THE REIGN OF DARIUS, AND IN THE REIGN OF CYRUS THE PERSIAN.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE pro&s;perity of this noble ruler, clearly appears from the whole hi&s;tory of his life. Though, in his youth, he was carried away cap|tive from Judea to Babylon; yet that dark and di&s;tre&s;&s;ing &s;cene &s;oon opened the way to a brighter pro&s;pect. His high de&s;cent, his graceful appear|ance, and his &s;hining talents, &s;ecured the royal fa|vor, and the peculiar privilege of a public educa|tion. Having fini&s;hed his academical cour&s;e, he was pre&s;ented, in u&s;ual form, before the reigning monarch; who, &s;trictly inquiring into his profi|ciency in learning, found him not only &s;uperior to
<PB N="6" REF="033675_0005_0FF7C88856857508">
all his companions, but ten times better than all the magicians and a&s;trologers in all his realm. Plea&s;ed with this promi&s;ing youth, he took him into his own pre&s;ence, and employed him in his own &s;ervice. This was only a &s;hort and ea&s;y &s;tep to higher preferment. Being called to tell, and to interpret the king's dream, which no other man was able to do, he was immediately advanced above all the governors in the province of Baby|lon. Though he had now &s;carcely reached the years of manhood, yet he faithfully and honorably di&s;charged the duties of his office, during the reign of Nebuchadnezzar, during the reign of Evil-Merodach, and until the clo&s;e of the reign of Bel&s;hazzar. At that portentous period, he was &s;ent for, to read, and to explain the hand-writing on the wall, which contained the awful doom of that vile and impious, prince; for which he was rai&s;ed to higher dignity, and made the third ruler in the kingdom. The following night, Babylon was taken, Bel&s;hazzar was &s;lain, and all his domin|ions thrown into the hands of Darius the Mede, by the victorious arms of Cyrus the Per&s;ian. Upon this large acce&s;&s;ion to his empire, Darius found it nece&s;&s;ary to make a new arrangement in the departments of &s;tate. And in this new ar|rangement, he took particular notice of the cel|ebrated Daniel, and placed him at the head of an hundred and twenty princes. Here, in &s;pite of all his enemies, he continued to pro&s;per, until Cyrus took the full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Per&s;ian monarchy. That au&s;picious event gave him a free and ea&s;y acce&s;s to Cyrus, and a happy opportunity of gain|ing a ju&s;t and honorable influence over that great and amiable prince. In a word, it was the pecu|liar lot of Daniel to enjoy the favor and confidence
<PB N="7" REF="033675_0006_0FF7C88B25A74C28">
of four of the greate&s;t monarchs of the Ea&s;t; and to &s;u&s;tain, with dignity and &s;ucce&s;s, &s;ome of the highe&s;t offices of &s;tate, for more than &s;ixty years, in a con&s;tant, uninterrupted &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. Such an|other in&s;tance of long and increa&s;ing pro&s;perity, in public life, we pre&s;ume to &s;ay, cannot be found in the whole hi&s;tory of man.</P>
<P>Succe&s;sful men have always been revered as well as admired. The Greeks and Romans held tho&s;e in high e&s;timation, who appeared to enjoy the peculiar &s;miles of the invi&s;ible powers. The &s;ame &s;entiment univer&s;ally prevails in the minds of men. They &s;pontaneou&s;ly conclude, that tho&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;ome extraordinary excellence, who are uncommonly &s;ucce&s;sful in any important &s;tation of life. And if the Supreme Being governs the natural and moral world, according to a previous connexion between cau&s;es and effects; there &s;eems to be a ju&s;t foundation to &s;uppo&s;e, that peculiar pro&s;perity is a mark of peculiar merit. Under the impre&s;&s;ion of this &s;entiment, it is very natural to inquire what extraordinary qualities Daniel po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, which mutually con&s;pired to promote his pro&s;perity, in the management of public affairs. Here it may be proper to ob&s;erve,</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> That this excellent and pro&s;perous ruler po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;uperior powers of mind. The Father of Spirits has been plea&s;ed to di&s;play the &s;ame &s;ove|reignty in the be&s;towment of intellectual facul|ties, as in the be&s;towment of inferior favors. To &s;ome he has given ten talents; to &s;ome five; and to &s;ome fewer. The minds of different men are differently con&s;tructed. In one man, the mem|ory is the &s;uperior power; in another, the imag|ination is the mo&s;t brilliant talent; in a third, a clear and penetrating judgment is the mo&s;t
<PB N="8" REF="033675_0007_0FF783B152BDC290">
prominent faculty; but in Daniel, all the&s;e nat|ural powers were equally &s;trong and well propor|tioned. His quick apprehen&s;ion and retentive memory were happily united with a &s;trong and penetrating judgment, which formed him a great and noble genius. This appears from the account which we have of his mental improvements. He acquired knowledge with the greate&s;t ea&s;e and rapidity; which di&s;covered a &s;prightly and re|tentive mind. And he was able to excel in every branch of &s;cience, to which he turned his atten|tion; which equally di&s;played the &s;trength and &s;ymmetry of all his intellectual powers. The&s;e, perhaps, &s;ome may choo&s;e to a&s;cribe to the pla&s;tic power of education: but taking education in the mo&s;t exten&s;ive latitude, in which Helvetius, or any other author u&s;es the term, it will not account for every mental di&s;tinction. It is readily admit|ted, that all the objects with which a man is &s;ur|rounded, and all the connexions and circum&s;tances in which he is placed, will either &s;trengthen, or weaken his original powers. But to a&s;cribe the&s;e powers to any thing <HI>exterior</HI> to the mind it&s;elf, is no le&s;s ab&s;urd, than to a&s;cribe the <HI>at|tractive</HI> power of the magnet to the needle, which only &s;erves to <HI>di&s;cover</HI> that peculiar property. Daniel, like every other man in the morning of life, was unacquainted with the native &s;trength of his own mind; but by repeated mental exertions, in the cour&s;e of his education, he <HI>di&s;covered</HI> tho&s;e &s;uperior talents, which qualified him to manage the affairs of government, with great reputation and &s;ucce&s;s. A party &s;pirit, or the favor of friends, or a peculiar concurrence of circum&s;tances, may chance to rai&s;e a man to a public &s;tation; but if his natural abilities are unequal to his office,
<PB N="9" REF="033675_0008_0FF7C86C02E58038">
he will mo&s;t certainly fall, to ri&s;e no more. But Daniel began to ri&s;e, by the dint of merit, and, therefore, he continued to ri&s;e from office to office, until he reached the next &s;tep to imperial power. Like Julius Ce&s;ar, he was born to govern, whether he lived in Judea, in Babylon, in Per&s;ia, or in any other quarter of the globe.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly.</HI> Daniel po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a large &s;hare of gen|eral information, which contributed to form him a great and &s;ucce&s;sful politician. Civil government is extremely complicated and exten&s;ive, both in theory and in practice. It embraces all the ob|jects in this world, and all the intere&s;ts and con|cerns of men, in this life. No &s;pecies of human knowledge is foreign to the bu&s;ine&s;s of a &s;tate&s;|man, who needs to be univer&s;ally acquainted with men and things. This idea was early and deeply impre&s;&s;ed on the mind of Daniel. He was born a prince, and received a princely education. Prov|idence directed his fir&s;t and &s;upreme view to the affairs of &s;tate. To be an able and &s;ucce&s;sful poli|tician, was the &s;ingle object, which engro&s;&s;ed his whole attention, and which guided all his exertions. And no per&s;on, perhaps, ever enjoyed more am|ple means and opportunities of attaining this ob|ject. His great capacity; his refined ta&s;te; his &s;tudious habit; his early acquaintance with the &s;olid branches of learning; and more e&s;pecially his <HI>peculiar &s;ituation,</HI> prepared him to acquire the large&s;t &s;tock of general knowledge.</P>
<P>Babylon &s;tood on the plains of Shinar, which was the mo&s;t venerable and mo&s;t enlightened &s;pot on the face of the earth. There the re&s;idue of men fir&s;t &s;ettled after the flood; and there they continued and increa&s;ed, until their ab&s;urd and impious attempt to build the tower of Babel, proved the occa&s;ion
<PB N="10" REF="033675_0009_0FF7C88CB707A198">
of a general di&s;per&s;ion. Though this gave a uni|ver&s;al &s;hock to human affairs, and naturally check|ed the progre&s;s of knowledge; yet the &s;eeds of &s;cience were happily pre&s;erved by the children of Ham, who &s;till remained on the plains of Babylon. That city, therefore, was the fountain-head of in|formation. There all the knowledge of both the old and of the new world concentred. There the arts and &s;ciences were fir&s;t cultivated. And there a literary &s;ociety was fir&s;t formed. The Chalde|ans, who compo&s;ed that &s;ociety, devoted them|&s;elves wholly to the improvements of the mind, and made it their whole bu&s;ine&s;s to acquire and di&s;&s;eminate every &s;pecies of rare and u&s;eful knowl|edge. And for this purpo&s;e, we may pre&s;ume, they not only made deep re&s;earches into the works of nature, but al&s;o collected from every quarter, the mo&s;t ancient and mo&s;t valuable di&s;|coveries on every important &s;ubject. In &s;uch a circle of learned men, and in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;o many means of information, &s;uch a man as Daniel, who had a peculiar capacity and ta&s;te for learning, mu&s;t have ama&s;&s;ed as large a &s;tock of human literature, as could be derived from all the labors and re|&s;earches of antiquity.</P>
<P>But I mu&s;t further ob&s;erve, that Daniel had the be&s;t &s;ources of information in his own hands; I mean the &s;acred books of divine In&s;piration. The&s;e acquainted him with the creation and fall of man, and the univer&s;al corruption of human na|ture. The&s;e exhibited the Church of God, as the great object, to which all human governments ought to be &s;ub&s;ervient. The&s;e placed before him a form of government, which was ab&s;olutely per|fect. The&s;e pre&s;ented him with the lives and characters of the greate&s;t and be&s;t &s;tate&s;men, for
<PB N="11" REF="033675_0010_0FF7C88EFA44CB38">
his con&s;tant imitation and encouragement. The&s;e reminded him of the awful fate of wicked nations and of wicked rulers. And the&s;e inculcated upon his own con&s;cience his &s;olemn obligations to live and act, like a dying and accountable creature. By reading and devoutly &s;tudying the&s;e &s;acred volumes, he obtained the be&s;t political as well as religious knowledge. Such a variety of books, however, would have been more injurious than beneficial to him, had he read without reflection, or thought without deci&s;ion. But his &s;trong, capacious, di&s;cerning mind could net be over|loaded with learning. Like Pericles, he was able "to turn and wind every thing to his own purpo&s;e," and to apply every &s;pecies of knowl|edge to a political u&s;e. The &s;tate phy&s;ician needs an immen&s;e fund of political information, in order to pre&s;cribe on all occa&s;ions, a proper remedy for every political di&s;order. Such a &s;ource of politi|cal information Daniel po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. He carried in his mind the hi&s;tory of the world, and the ex|perience of ages. This enabled him to act with propriety, in every &s;ituation, and always to &s;uc|ceed in all his public mea&s;ures. But,</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> Daniel's extraordinary wi&s;dom was no le&s;s beneficial, than his great information. Neb|uchadnezzar pronounced him, even in his youth, to be ten times better "in all matters of wi&s;dom," than all the wi&s;e men in Babylon. And before he was thirty, his eminent wi&s;dom was univer&s;ally known and celebrated, not only through the em|pire,. but through all the neighboring nations.</P>
<P>The haughty king of Tyrus had heard of the fame of his wi&s;dom, otherwi&s;e he could not have felt the force of that &s;evere reproof of the in|&s;pired prophet: "Thou art wi&s;er than. Daniel."</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="033675_0011_0FF7C86DB6182118">Wi&s;dom is a term of various and exten&s;ive meaning. It includes not only invention, but fore&s;ight and &s;agacity. Wi&s;dom certainly im|plies the power of invention. It enables a man to take a clear and comprehen&s;ive view of things; and, under that view, to form the noble&s;t de&s;igns, and to adopt the be&s;t means to accompli&s;h the be&s;t purpo&s;es. But after a man has devi&s;ed a great and complicated &s;cheme, and made choice of the prop|er mea&s;ures to carry it into execution, there is &s;till occa&s;ion for what is commonly called fore|&s;ight. This is that part of wi&s;dom, which looks forward to, and provides again&s;t, unfore&s;een con|tingencies, which may po&s;&s;ibly defeat a great and good de&s;ign. But for<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ght is founded in &s;agacity, which is the power o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> di&s;cerning the near and remote connexion of things; of di&s;covering the peculiar di&s;po&s;itions of mankind; and of pene|trating their mo&s;t dark and deep de&s;igns.</P>
<P>A large mea&s;ure of wi&s;dom, in all its branches, is indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary to form a great and good politician. Civil rulers are obliged, by the nature of their office, to be intimately concerned with eve|ry de&s;cription of men. And unle&s;s they are "as wi&s;e as &s;erpents and as harmle&s;s as doves," they are in the utmo&s;t danger of being betrayed into mea&s;ures, which will be injurious :o them&s;elves as well as to the public. Rehoboam lo&s;t the greate&s;t part of his kingdom, by hearkening to the evil advice of young and conceited coun&s;ellors. Polit|ical &s;lorms and tempe&s;ts often ri&s;e, in which the able&s;t &s;tate&s;men find occa&s;ion to exert all their wi&s;dom, to divi&s;e the be&s;t mea&s;ures, to prevent the political &s;hip from foundering. Daniel fre|quently employed his wi&s;dom to great advantage. By his wi&s;e and prudent conduct, he &s;ecured the
<PB N="13" REF="033675_0012_0FF7C86F62BE4598">
favor and a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Cyrus, in re&s;toring the Jews to their native land. By his great &s;agacity, he obtained the liberty of living according to the laws of his own religion. When he preferred his reque&s;t to the &s;uperintendant of the captives, he replied, that he could not grant it, without endangering his head to the king. But Daniel was &s;o perfectly acquainted with every avenue to the human heart, that he brought his benefactor to a cheerful compliance, even at the ri&s;k of his life. So, when the king had &s;igned a ra&s;h and cruel decree, to de&s;troy all the wi&s;e men of Bab|ylon, he had the "wi&s;dom and coun&s;el" to &s;top the executioner in the di&s;charge of his office, to appea&s;e the wrath of the king, and to pre&s;erve the lives of many of his mo&s;t valuable &s;ubjects. By virtue of &s;uch extraordinary wi&s;dom, he was able to promote his own and the public good; and to &s;ucceed in the admini&s;tration of the mo&s;t de&s;potic government, that ever exi&s;ted.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly.</HI> Daniel was a man of invincible firm|ne&s;s. This was but the natural effect of his wi&s;|dom. He was able to think for him&s;elf; to form his own opinions; and to comprehend the nature and tendency of his own de&s;igns. Having, therefore, once deliberately and wi&s;ely concerted a mea&s;ure, he expected to &s;ucceed, and eventually to gain the approbation of the public. This well-founded confidence in&s;pired him, with irre&s;i&s;tible vigor and fortitude, in the pro&s;ecution of all his public mea&s;ures. If he met with difficulty, or oppo&s;ition, he &s;teadily pur&s;ued his object, and appealed to the <HI>end,</HI> to ju&s;tify the <HI>propriety</HI> of the <HI>means.</HI> He en|treated Melzar to <HI>try</HI> his propo&s;ed expedient, and promi&s;ed to renounce it, if it did not eventually an|&s;wer a wi&s;e and valuable purpo&s;e. So, he be&s;ought
<PB N="14" REF="033675_0013_0FF7C8912E1B2578">
the king to &s;u&s;pend the execution of his ha&s;ly de|cree, only upon the condition, that his dream &s;hould be interpreted, and his wi&s;hes completely gratified. Being ever fully per&s;uaded of the wi&s;|dom and rectitude of his public conduct, he was always willing to &s;uffer the oppo&s;ition and clamor of the multitude, until <HI>his</HI> wi&s;dom and rectitude &s;hould have a fair opportunity to triumph over all <HI>their</HI> prejudice and folly. Such a firmne&s;s of mind is the rever&s;e of a vain and fooli&s;h ob&s;tinacy, which con&s;i&s;ts in a wilful oppo&s;ition to the dictates of wi&s;dom. This was the fault of Pharaoh, who ruined him&s;elf and his kingdom, by rejecting the advice of Mo&s;es. This was the fault of Saul, who di&s;obeyed the voice of Samuel, and forfeited his title to the throne of I&s;rael. And this was the fault of Ahab, who de&s;pi&s;ed the admonition of the prophet, and died as a fool dieth, at Ramoth-Gil|ead. But Mo&s;es, Jo&s;hua, and Caleb, di&s;played a wi&s;e and noble firmne&s;s, in conducting the chil|dren of I&s;rael to the land of promi&s;e, notwith&s;tand|ing all their unrea&s;onable oppo&s;ition and com|plaints. If we con&s;ult the hi&s;tory of rulers, we &s;hall find firmne&s;s of mind to be one of the di&s;tin|gui&s;hing features of every great and pro&s;perous &s;tate&s;man. And how often did God enjoin it upon the rulers of I&s;rael, "to be &s;trong and of a good courage," in the di&s;charge of their difficult and dangerous duties? There is no one thing, perhaps, more conducive to &s;ucce&s;s in any im|portant and difficult undertaking, than a firm, &s;teady, unremitting &s;pirit. And we have abundant rea&s;on to conclude, that this noble &s;pirit had a large &s;hare of influence, in promoting the &s;ucce&s;s and pro&s;perity of Daniel, in &s;ome of the mo&s;t crit|ical mid hazardous &s;ituations of his public life.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="033675_0014_0FF7C892B745BFF0"><HI>Fifthly.</HI> This &s;ame Daniel, who pro&s;pered &s;o much under the mo&s;t arbitrary princes, was a per|fect pattern of inviolable integrity. But this is meant, that he always aimed to do ju&s;tice, and to treat every man according to the eternal rule of right. As a ruler, he acted upon principle, in guarding the lives, the properties, and the char|acters of his &s;ubjects. Of this, we have incon|te&s;table evidence, even the united te&s;timony of his mo&s;t malicious enemies. "Then the pre&s;i|dents and princes &s;ought to find occa&s;ion again&s;t Daniel concerning the kingdom; but they could find none occa&s;ion nor fault; fora&s;much as he was <HI>faithful</HI>" It is very remarkable, that the mo&s;t critical and malignant eyes could di&s;cover no blemi&s;h in the integrity of Daniel, through the whole cour&s;e of his public conduct. But we are to remember, that he had derived his moral &s;enti|ments from the pure &s;ource of divine In&s;piration. He had read, with &s;erious attention, the &s;olemn charge, which Mo&s;es delivered to the judges of I&s;rael. "Hear the cau&s;es between every man and his brother, and the &s;tranger that is with him. Ye &s;hall not re&s;pect per&s;ons in judgment, but ye &s;hall hear the &s;mall as well as the great: ye &s;hall not be afraid of the face of man; the judgment is God's." He had felt the force of that divine admonition to every civil officer in every civil de|partment: "That which is <HI>altogether ju&s;t</HI> &s;halt thou follow." But, perhaps, no text in the Bible had a more &s;teady, powerful, and practical influence upon his mind, than the la&s;t words which God put into the mouth of a dying &s;tate&s;man. "The God of I&s;rael &s;aid, the rock of I&s;rael &s;poke to me, <HI>He that ruleth over men mu&s;t be ju&s;t.</HI>"</P>
<P>The promotion of <HI>ju&s;tice</HI> is the ultimate object of every branch of civil government. This is
<PB N="16" REF="033675_0015_0FF7C89512CB95A0">
clearly and forcibly expre&s;&s;ed, by an eminent Brit|i&s;h writer. "We are," &s;ays he, "to look upon all the va&s;t apparatus of our government, as having ultimately no other object or purpo&s;e but <HI>the di&s;|tribution of ju&s;tice,</HI> or in other words, the &s;upport of the twelve judges. Kings and parliaments, fleets and armies, officers of the court and revenue, amba&s;&s;adors, mini&s;ters, and privy-coun&s;ellors, are all &s;ubordinate in their end to <HI>this part</HI> of admini&s;|tration." If the &s;upport of ju&s;tice be the ultimate de&s;ign of all civil governments, then the exerci&s;e of ju&s;tice mu&s;t be the indi&s;pen&s;able duty of all civil rulers. They are appointed, not &s;o much to <HI>pro|mote,</HI> as to <HI>defend</HI> the public intere&s;t. Though they have the power of enacting laws; yet they have no right to di&s;&s;olve the &s;olemn obligation of mutual contracts, nor to require any man to do a &s;ingle act, which is repugnant to that immuta|ble ju&s;tice, which is founded in the nature of things. And though they do, in a &s;en&s;e, hold the pur&s;e-&s;trings of the people; yet they have no right to di&s;po&s;e of the public property for any other purpo&s;e, than the promotion of public ju&s;|tice. If they grant donations to particular corpo|rations, or to particular per&s;ons, they ought to do it, not for the &s;ake of tho&s;e particular corporations, or particular per&s;ons, but &s;imply to promote the public good. Indeed, their whole public conduct ought to be regulated, by the infallible &s;tandard of immutable ju&s;tice. It is required of all &s;tew|ards, whether &s;acred or civil, that a man be found faithful. Fidelity in civil rulers is, of all other virtues, the mo&s;t acceptable to the people, who univer&s;ally feel its happy influence, in every con|dition of life. Hence mankind have always mani|fe&s;ted an uncommon attachment to, and venera|tion
<PB N="17" REF="033675_0016_0FF7C872B62340C0">
for, tho&s;e eminent rulers who have given uniform and unequivocal proofs of their moral rectitude. Ari&s;tides among the Greeks, Cato among the Romans, and Daniel among the Jews, will be forever celebrated for their incorruptible integrity. This is that &s;terling excellence in a &s;tate&s;man, which needs no in&s;cription, nor crow|ned head, to give it a univer&s;al currency among all nations of the earth. It was this rare, &s;hining, captivating virtue of integrity, that recommended Daniel to Jews and Babylonians; to Medes and Per&s;ians; to Darius and Cyrus; and to every other prince, who employed him in public af|fairs. But,</P>
<P><HI>Finally,</HI> The pro&s;perity of Daniel, amid&s;t all the burdens and dangers of public life, mu&s;t be principally a&s;cribed to his eminent piety and devo|tion. Like other men, who &s;tood upon the pinna|cle of power, he was continually expo&s;ed to the &s;evere&s;t &s;trokes of adver&s;ity. He came into ad|mini&s;tration in troublous times; and had a clear prophetic view of the dreadful convul&s;ions, which were ju&s;t ready to &s;eize an expiring empire. And whil&s;t he &s;at in the king's gate, he was a &s;pec|tator of many of tho&s;e awful &s;cenes, which were a fulfilment of his own predictions. He &s;aw the haughty king of Babylon &s;hook from his throne, driven from men, and degraded below the bea&s;ts that peri&s;h. He attended monarch after monarch to the &s;ilent man&s;ions of the dead; and felt tho&s;e heavy &s;hocks, which falling princes never fail to give. And he was per&s;onally involved in the horrors of that memorable night, which &s;unk a mighty empire in perpetual ruin. But none of the&s;e things moved him, becau&s;e his heart was fixed, tru&s;ting in the Lord. Tho&s;e national convul&s;ions
<PB N="18" REF="033675_0017_0FF783B40D85D290">
and revolutions, which proved &s;o fatal to others, all con&s;pired to promote <HI>his</HI> per&s;onal pro&s;|perity and &s;ucce&s;s. He &s;ecured the favor and pro|tection of Heaven, by his &s;incere and exemplary piety. He carried conviction to all around him, that he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a truly "divine and excellent &s;pirit." His religion was neither a glowing en|thu&s;ia&s;m, nor a gloomy &s;uper&s;tition; but a pure and &s;teady principle of univer&s;al benevolence. He gave God the &s;upreme affection of his heart; and was neither afraid nor a&s;hamed to pro&s;e&s;s the true religion, in the mid&s;t of a country and a court, that were involved in the gro&s;&s;e&s;t idolatry. He extended his benevolent regards to all the children of men, whether Jews, or Gentiles. He zealou&s;ly promoted the cau&s;e of religion; and &s;pent days and weeks, in humble, &s;ervent, effect|ual prayers for the pro&s;perity of Zion. He walked within his hou&s;e with a perfect heart, and every day called upon God, at the head of his family. This he did; not becau&s;e it was a common and rep|utable practice; but becau&s;e it was a plain and im|portant duty, which he owed to God, and to tho&s;e whom God had committed to his care and in&s;truction. His family devotion was known to his enemies as well as to his friends; and becau&s;e there was nothing el&s;e to take hold of, his enemies took hold of this, as the only po&s;&s;ible engine to work his ruin. Accordingly, they con&s;pired to|gether and obtained a royal decree, that "if any per&s;on &s;hould a&s;k a petition of any God or man for thirty days, except of the king, he &s;hould be ca&s;t into the den of lions." As &s;oon as he knew the writing was &s;igned, he went to his hou&s;e, opened his windows, fell upon his knees, and three times a day prayed and gave thanks to God. This
<PB N="19" REF="033675_0018_0FF7C8986A86E6E0">
threw him into the hands of his enemies, and out of the protection of his prince, who was con|&s;trained to expo&s;e him to the furious bea&s;ts of prey. But his heroic faith and &s;ervent prayers &s;topped the mouths of lions, defeated the de&s;igns of his enemies, and &s;moothed the path of declining life with &s;ignal pro&s;perity. For it is in immediate reference to this a&s;toni&s;hing event, that it is em|phatically &s;aid in. the words of our text&mdash;"So this Daniel pro&s;pered in the reign of Darius, and in the reign of Cyrus the Per&s;ian."</P>
<P>I have now delineated the mo&s;t prominent fea|tures of this great and amiable &s;tate&s;man. His life is a bright a&s;&s;emblage of all the human virtues. And it is a ju&s;t and beautiful remark, that "the <HI>collected</HI> virtues of one man, &s;trike the mind much more forcibly and advantageou&s;ly, than the <HI>&s;cattered</HI> vir|tues of many." Permit me then to hold up the character of Daniel as a mirror, in which all per|&s;ons, and e&s;pecialiy tho&s;e in places of power and tru&s;t, may clearly and &s;en&s;ibly di&s;cover both what they <HI>are</HI> and what they <HI>ought</HI> to be.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t thing &s;ugge&s;ted by this excellent char|acter is, that great and good rulers are worthy of the highe&s;t re&s;pect. Who can contemplate the pious, virtuous, and u&s;eful life of Daniel, without paying him the &s;incere homage of the heart? Whil&s;t he was acting his noble part on the &s;tage of life, the happy influence of his public and pri|vate virtues commanded univer&s;al admiration and e&s;tee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&punc; The greate&s;t men in his day, honored him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ond the bounds of duty, or even propriety. Nebuchadnezzar pro&s;trated him&s;elf at his feet, and payed him the exce&s;s of Ea&s;tern complai&s;ance. Darius gave him the &s;tronge&s;t marks of &s;incere and ardent affection. Nor was he le&s;s e&s;teemed
<PB N="20" REF="033675_0019_0FF7C8391FEBB120">
in the court of heaven. The &s;upreme Ruler di&s;|patched an envoy extraordinary to a&s;&s;ure him, "he was greatly beloved" by his Maker, and by all the principalities and powers above. This was no unmeaning compliment, but a divine te&s;ti|mony to his ju&s;t de&s;ert of univer&s;al love and re|&s;pect. All civil rulers of the &s;ame character, are equally objects of the highe&s;t veneration and re|gard. They are mini&s;ters of God for good to the people, and the principal in&s;truments of all their temporal pro&s;perity. Though the inventors of arts and &s;ciences, and the promoters of agricul|ture and commerce, de&s;erve the public e&s;teem; yet wi&s;e and faithful rulers have a better claim to univer&s;al gratitude and re&s;pect. For it is ulti|mately owing to their exertions, that mankind derive any real benefit from their labors, their &s;tudies, or any of their natural advantages, A people may flouri&s;h in all the arts of Italy, or abound in all the wealth of the Indies; and yet drag out a poor, mi&s;erable life, under the power and oppre&s;&s;ion of a cruel and rapacious tyrant. But ju&s;t men, ruling in the fear of God, give a people the full enjoyment of all the ble&s;&s;ings of Providence. Tho&s;e rulers, therefore, who direct all their views to the public good, and exert all their power and influence to promote it, are great benefactors to the world, and de&s;erve to be uni|ver&s;ally re&s;pected and revered. For this cau&s;e, therefore, God expre&s;sly commands every &s;oul to be &s;ubject to the higher powers, not only for wrath, but al&s;o for con&s;cience &s;ake; rendering to all in authority their dues; tribute to whom tribute is due; cu&s;tom to whom cu&s;tom; fear to whom fear; honor to whom honor.</P>
<P>The pious and devout life of Daniel, in the next place, loudly admoni&s;hes civil rulers how
<PB N="21" REF="033675_0020_0FF7C899F254DF58">
much they are capable of doing, to promote the <HI>religious</HI> as well as civil intere&s;ts of the people. The children of I&s;rael were extremely addicted to the wor&s;hip of idols, from the time they made the golden calf, to the time of their captivity in Baby|lon. But in that land of idols, the parent of idolatry, they were effectually and finally cured of their national &s;in. This great and extraordinary reformation, we mu&s;t conclude, was brought about by the in&s;trumentality of Daniel. The captive tribes were &s;truck with his plous and ex|emplary conduct, in the mid&s;t of the wor&s;hippers of idols. They &s;aw him pay a &s;trict and &s;acred regard to tho&s;e divine rites and ceremonies, which were de&s;igned to &s;eparate <HI>them,</HI> from all the idola|trous nations. They &s;aw him daily and devoutly wor&s;hip the true God, in his own family. They &s;aw his faith and piety &s;top the lions' mouths. They heard, with deep conviction, proclamation after proclamation, publi&s;hed by the great mon|archs of Babylon, giving honor to the God of Dan|iel, and pouring contempt upon every fal&s;e and inferior deity. They were acquainted with his days of mourning, fa&s;ting, and prayer, for the revival of religion, and the pro&s;perity of the Church. In a word, they &s;aw the pure&s;t piety con&s;tantly di&s;played in the life of a man, who was &s;eated in the king's gate, and univer&s;ally loved and revered. And is it a thing incredible, that the pious example and influence of &s;uch a great and renowned ruler &s;hould awe the minds of a whole nation, and con&s;train them to ca&s;t all their idols to the moles and to the bats forever? The living example of other religious rulers has had the &s;ame transforming influence upon the minds of their &s;ubjects. We read, "The people &s;erved
<PB N="22" REF="033675_0021_0FF7C83C935F0BA0">
the Lord all the days of Jo&s;hua, and all the days of the Elders that outlived Jo&s;hua."</P>
<P>Among the pious kings of Judah, do we find one, who ever failed to bring about a vi&s;ible re|formation in piety and virtue? And is it not equal|ly true, that pious rulers, by their per&s;onal exam|ple and influence, have actually formed the moral and religious character of the people in this land? We know, that &s;o long as all the governors, &s;ena|tors, and repre&s;entatives of this Commonwealth, were public profe&s;&s;ors and zealous promoters of religion, the &s;abbaths were &s;anctified; the hou&s;es of God were filled; divine in&s;titutions were at|tended; family religion and parental authority were maintained; cards, and balls, and theatres were unknown, and all open vice and infidelity were treated with general and ju&s;t contempt. Whether this was pure &s;uper&s;tition, or pure re|ligion, it was certainly owing, in a great mea&s;ure, to the example of civil rulers, who meant to form the people to virtue and piety. It is to be ex|pected, that rulers &s;hould form the character of the people, and not that the people &s;hould form the character of rulers. It was never known, that the hou&s;e of I&s;rael reformed one of their loo&s;e, ire|ligious kings; but it was often known, that one pious, exemplary king reformed the whole nation. If <HI>Daniel</HI> had fallen into the corruptions of Baby|lon, there is not the lea&s;t probability, that his peo|ple could have prevented his ruin. But when <HI>they</HI> had for&s;aken the paths of virtue and piety, he was able, by his per&s;onal example and influence, to bring them back to the wor&s;hip and &s;ervice of the God of their fathers. Civil rulers would find no occa&s;ion of promoting religion, by their <HI>laws,</HI> if they would only heartily and unitedly promote it, by their <HI>lives.</HI> Let them only <HI>live religion,</HI> and
<PB N="23" REF="033675_0022_0FF7C89BBA1C4438">
they will do enough to di&s;charge their duty; and I will venture to add, they will do enough to form this people to a virtuous and religious character. For if this effect &s;hould not flow from the exam|ple of their virtue and piety, it would be a &s;ingular in&s;tance, and &s;uch an one as cannot be found in the hi&s;tory of any nation, from the beginning of the world to this day. If civil rulers carry the power of reformation in their own hands, then their ob|ligation to reform the people, mu&s;t be equal to that power. Let me, therefore, entreat the man of office, the man of honor, the man of influence, &s;e|riou&s;ly to con&s;ider, that "to him that knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to him it is &s;in."</P>
<P>It further appears from the character and con|duct of Daniel, that tho&s;e who &s;it in the highe&s;t &s;eats of government, have no excu&s;e to neglect the profe&s;&s;ion and practice of vital piety. Real reli|gion is nece&s;&s;ary on their own account, as well as on account of tho&s;e, who live under the influence of their powerful example. It is hard to &s;ay, whether the mo&s;t dignified characters de&s;erve our veneration, more than our tender compa&s;&s;ion. They are certainly &s;urrounded with peculiar temp|tations to forget their Creator, and to neglect the one thing needful. But Daniel has told them by his example, that they are under a great delu&s;ion, if they once imagine, their high &s;tations and public employments, will afford them the lea&s;t excu&s;e for neglecting the duties of piety and devotion. They cannot &s;eriou&s;ly believe, that they have greater temptations to re&s;i&s;t, than Daniel re&s;i&s;ted; nor greater difficulties and embarra&s;&s;ments to &s;ur|mount, than Daniel &s;urmounted. He was born a prince, and &s;pent his whole life in the pre&s;ence of princes. But whil&s;t he lived with the princes of Judah; whil&s;t he marched with the army of the
<PB N="24" REF="033675_0023_0FF7C87510DA54C0">
Chaldeans; and whil&s;t he re&s;ided with the gay di&s;&s;olute youth, in Babylon, he remembered obeyed his Creator. When his office &s;eated him in the king's gate, &s;urrounded by profligate and infidel courtiers, he &s;upported and adorned his re|ligious profe&s;&s;ion. When an hundred and twenty princes &s;at at his feet, and the affairs of an hundred and twenty princes lay upon his hands, he found time and opportunity for the performance of every religious duty. And when propriety required him to &s;ubmit to the mo&s;t public and pompous parade; to be clothed in the &s;ilks of Per&s;ia, and adorned with the gold of Ophir; and to receive the incen&s;e of public honors; he could &s;ilently retire in the clo&s;e of the day, and humbly pro&s;trate him&s;elf, as a poor, guilty worm, before the &s;upreme Maje&s;ty of heaven and earth, and devoutly implore his mercy. He very well knew, that though ornaments and honors might dazzle the eyes of unthinking multi|tudes, and conceal his imperfections from the view of men; yet they could by no means hide his heart, or conceal his criminal defects from the omni&s;cient eye of God, to whom he &s;tood account|able for all his internal feelings and external con|duct;. If young politicians, if aged &s;tate&s;men, if the mo&s;t dignified characters on earth, would &s;e|riou&s;ly &s;urvey the pious and devout life of Daniel, they would be fully convinced, that neither the cares, nor honors, nor temptations of public life, can di&s;&s;olve their obligations to call upon God; to read his word; to reverence his &s;anctuary; and to attend all his holy and &s;acred in&s;titutions. Dig|nity and devotion have been, and may be united. Rulers ove men have been, and may be, the mo&s;t humble and faithful &s;ervants of God. "Be wi&s;e now therefore, O ye kings: be in&s;tructed, ye judges
<PB N="25" REF="033675_0024_0FF7C876B9C68AE8">
of the earth. Serve the Lord with fear, and re|joice with trembling." Moreover,</P>
<P>The faith and piety of Daniel reprove the igno|rance and pre&s;umption of tho&s;e politicians, who profe&s;s and propagate the principles of infidelity. The infidels, in our Savior's day, were men of &s;u|perior rank and figure. And it is well known, that infidelity has commonly been fir&s;t imbibed and propagated, by profe&s;&s;ed philo&s;ophers and politi|cians. Men of this exalted character have lately &s;pread athei&s;m and infidelity through a great na|tion; and attempted to diffu&s;e the poi&s;on of their irreligious and di&s;organizing &s;entiments among the people of America. Such champions of infidelity endeavor to &s;hake our faith in natural and revealed religion, by carrying us back into the dark regions of antiquity. Hume, Voltaire, and Condorcet, repre&s;ent mankind as being originally involved in ignorance and barbari&s;m. And they pretend to trace the progre&s;s of the human mind, in emerg|ing from that primitive &s;avage &s;tate, and gradually ri&s;ing to a nobler &s;tate of civilization, learning, and infidelity. But were <HI>they</HI> better acquainted with the dark regions of antiquity, and with the ri&s;e and progre&s;s of human improvements, than the pious and learned Daniel? Did they ever live with him on the plains of Shinar? Did they ever &s;earch the &s;ame records and traditions of antiquity, which he &s;earched? Did they ever conver&s;e with the Chaldeans, with whom he conver&s;ed? Were they ever per&s;onally acquainted, as he was, with the learned Amonians, who, as an incomparable wri|ter has clearly proved,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bryant on Ancient Mythology.</NOTE> &s;pread every &s;pecies of civil, political, and religious knowledge, through Egypt, through Greece, and through every part of the inhabited world? The mo&s;t learned infidels
<PB N="26" REF="033675_0025_0FF7C82980827288">
of the pre&s;ent age, who have ran&s;acked the bowels of the earth, and the dark corners of the globe, to pick up arguments again&s;t revealed religion, are but minute philo&s;ophers, in compari&s;on with Daniel. Whil&s;t he &s;tood on the plains of Baby|lon, with the Bible in one hand, and all antiquity in the other, he &s;aw, as clearly as the &s;un at noon|day, the <HI>truth</HI> and <HI>divinity</HI> of that holy religion, which came down from heaven, through the me|dium of divine In&s;piration. All his knowledge of the natural, moral, and political world, in&s;tead of weakening, confirmed his faith in the &s;criptures of truth. <HI>His</HI> &s;trong and cordial belief of divine rev|elation, therefore, completely demon&s;trates, what has often been ju&s;tly a&s;&s;erted, that infidelity is not &s;eated in the <HI>head,</HI> but in the <HI>heart</HI>; and flows not from profound knowledge, but from a meaner and more criminal cau&s;e. Is it not &s;ufficient to &s;trike any modern infidel entirely dumb, to a&s;k him this plain, pertinent, pointed que&s;tion, "Art thou wi&s;er than Daniel?"</P>
<P>Another important reflection, naturally &s;ugge&s;t|ed by the conduct of this able &s;tate&s;man, is, that civil rulers have no occa&s;ion for the u&s;e of art or intrigue, in any of their public mea&s;ures. Tho&s;e who conduct the intricate affairs of government ought to be wi&s;e and prudent; but yet they &s;hould never be artful, or de&s;igning. There are, how|ever, profe&s;&s;ed politicians, who recommend this mode of conduct, by precept as well as example. They in&s;inuate, that no man can &s;ucceed in poli|tical affairs without taking advantage of the weakne&s;s, folly, and caprice of human nature, and making u&s;e or mea&s;ures, which are diametrically oppo&s;ite to every idea of integrity. Some grave writers on moral and political philo&s;ophy, plainly inculcate the fir&s;t principles of inju&s;tice and du|plicity.
<PB N="27" REF="033675_0026_0FF7C89E56F8B8D8">
They lay it down as a maxim, that poli|ticians may and ought to make <HI>utility,</HI> or what they conceive to be the general good the &s;upreme rule of their conduct. But a great and good ruler will adopt and act upon a far more hone&s;t and noble principle; "Let <HI>ju&s;tice</HI> be done, though the univer&s;e &s;hould &s;ink." Daniel found wi&s;dom and integrity abundantly &s;ufficient to an&s;wer all his political purpo&s;es, without ever &s;tooping to the low arts of intrigue. The&s;e he was able to de|&s;cribe, and the&s;e he was able to defeat. In draw|ing the characters of the king of the North and of the king of the South, he gave a lively and &s;triking picture of two profoundly artful and in|triguing politicians. "And both the&s;e kings' hearts &s;hall be to do mi&s;chief, and they &s;hall &s;peak lies at one table; but it &s;hall not pro&s;per." Whil&s;t he pre&s;ided over an hundred and twenty princes, he clearly and &s;enfibly perceived the nature and tendency of that diabolical policy, which they em|ployed to take away his life. But he oppo&s;ed hone&s;ty to di&s;hone&s;ly; ju&s;tice to inju&s;tice; wi&s;dom to cunning; and open integrity to all their dark and deep de&s;igns. Nor did he fail of confound|ing their coun&s;els; and of turning their own artful and malicious devices to their own de&s;truc|tion. Truly wi&s;e and upright politicians will never find occa&s;ion to employ any other weapon than perfect integrity, in order to defeat the per|nicious purpo&s;es of their mo&s;t &s;ubtile and malign|nant enemies, whether at home or abroad. Be it &s;o, that our pre&s;ent connexion with di&s;tant na|tions may expo&s;e us to the arts and intrigues of foreign courts; yet tho&s;e, who have the direction of our national concerns, may rely upon it, that a fair, open, upright conduct will be the be&s;t meth|od, to fru&s;trate the art, the duplicity, and unju&s;t
<PB N="28" REF="033675_0027_0FF7C87875107130">
policy of <HI>five,</HI> or of <HI>five hundred</HI> unprincipled poli|ticians.</P>
<P>This naturally leads me to ob&s;erve, in the la&s;t place, that civil rulers have &s;ufficient <HI>encourage|ment</HI> to be faithful, in the di&s;charge of all their public duties. The&s;e, I &s;fhall not go out of my province to pre&s;cribe, nor even to &s;ugge&s;t. If pub|lic men are but only faithful; there is no ground of anxiety about the wi&s;dom or propriety of their public mea&s;ures. Faithfulne&s;s, however, cannot be too often nor too forcibly inculcated upon tho&s;e who have many opportunities, and of cour&s;e many temptations to betray their tru&s;ts. But it is happy to reflect, that their <HI>encouragement</HI> to fidelity, is abundantly &s;ufficent to balance all their unfa|vorable circum&s;tances. The favor of God, and the e&s;teem of men, are the mo&s;t animating motives to duty. The&s;e had a commanding influence over the views and conduct of one of the mo&s;t able and upright rulers. Daniel found by happy ex|perience, that hone&s;ty was the be&s;t policy. For, his faithfulne&s;s to the Deity, &s;ecured <HI>his</HI> favor and a&s;&s;i&s;tance; and his fidelity to men, &s;ecured <HI>their</HI> &s;incere and warm attachment to his per&s;on and intere&s;t. As he con&s;tantly per&s;evered and increa&s;ed in integrity; &s;o he con&s;tantly increa&s;ed in wealth, in honor, and outward pro&s;perity. Let who would fall, Daniel &s;tood* Let who would &s;ink, Daniel ro&s;e. Let who would be in power, Daniel was their favorite. Let who would combine again&s;t him, Daniel always &s;ucceeded and pro&s;pered.</P>
<P>Is not this example worthy of the notice and imitation of all who &s;it in the &s;eats of govern|ment? And may I not, with great propriety, take occa&s;ion from it, to pre&s;s the duty of fidelity upon the Honorable Legi&s;lature of this Commonwealth, which holds the fir&s;t rank in the United States,
<PB N="29" REF="033675_0028_0FF7C87ADA799E50">
for piety and virtue, as well as political im|portance? This large and religious community, are devoutly wi&s;hing and praying for a faithful admini&s;tration of government. They would &s;hud|der at the thought, that their rulers &s;hould lift their hands to Heaven, and &s;olemnly engage to admini&s;ter a government, which they meant to un|dermine; and to protect a people, whom they meant to de&s;troy. Their minds are alarmed at threatening dangers; and nothing can give them ea&s;e, but an un&s;haken confidence in the fidelity of their rulers. They do not di&s;tru&s;t their abilities; but they may entertain &s;ome apprehen&s;ions re&s;pecting their integrity, &s;ince their enemies boa&s;t of corrupting it. But if tho&s;e who direct our pub|lic affairs, would only di&s;play the piety, the in|tegrity, and firmne&s;s of Daniel, they would un|doubtedly po&s;&s;e&s;s the entire affection and confi|dence of this great and intelligent people. In|deed, &s;ome of the fir&s;t characters in this Legi&s;lature, have already merited and &s;ecured the e&s;teem and attachment of an enlightened part, and were it not invidious, I would add, of the mo&s;t enligh|tened part of this Commonwealth. Notwith&s;tand|ing the weakne&s;fs and prejudice of &s;ome, we e&s;teem it a favorable circum&s;tance, that his Excellency has heretofore filled a dignified &s;tation; in which he had a peculiar opportunity of di&s;covering his uprightne&s;s, and at the &s;ame time of forgetting the &s;ubtilties, and of imbibing the genuine &s;pirit of the laws. This, and all the States in the Union, are much indebted to many eminent civilians, for the knowledge, the wi&s;dom, and the integrity, which they di&s;played, in framing the Federal Con&s;titu|tion; which is not, and perhaps never will be, inferior to any one of mere human invention. This excellent con&s;titution is the ba&s;is of all our

national &s;afety and happine&s;s. And it is extreme|ly difficult to conceive, that a &s;ingle American, who is friendly to any good government, &s;hould be unfriendly to his own; and wi&s;h to alienate the affections of the people from it. But it is very natural to conclude, that the framers of the Con|&s;titution and tho&s;e who were per&s;onally concerned in adopting it, &s;hould cheri&s;h an uncommon at|tachment to it, and labor to &s;upport it, with di&s;|tingui&s;hed ardor and zeal. Upon this ground, the people have a ju&s;t right to expect, that His Excel|lency will never mar the production of his own hands; nor renounce tho&s;e political principles, which he has publickly and &s;olemnly &s;anctioned, and which have had their proper influence in rai&s;|ing him to the head of this Commonwealth.</P>
<P>His Honor the Lieutenant-Governor, and the principal members of the Council, of the Senate, and of the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives, have not on|ly gained the &s;uffrages, but what is far more hon|orable and de&s;irable, the <HI>confidence</HI> of the people, who &s;incerely e&s;teem them for their able and faith|ful &s;ervices.. May this operate as a powerful and endearing motive to future fidelity and zeal, in the di&s;charge of their important tru&s;ts. The great|e&s;t of all the men of the Ea&s;t, was highly gratified and animated, by the &s;incere affection of his grate|ful and dutiful &s;ubjects. "When I went out to the gate through the city, when I prepared my &s;eat in the &s;treet, the young men &s;aw me, and hid them&s;elves; and the aged aro&s;e, and &s;tood up. When the ear heard me, then it ble&s;&s;ed me; and when the eye &s;aw me, it gave witne&s;s to me: Be|cau&s;e I delivered the poor that cried, and the father|le&s;s, and him that had none to help him. I put on righteou&s;ne&s;s, and it clothed me: My judgment
<PB N="31" REF="033675_0030_0FF7C8A4288BAB50">
was as a robe and diadem. I broke the jaws of the wicked, and plucked the &s;poil out of his teeth."</P>
<P>Such, &s;incerely re&s;pected rulers, are the con|&s;oling reflections, which naturally flow from fideli|ty in public life. If, therefore, you have begun to be faithful in your various departments, be not weary in well-doing; but be &s;tedfa&s;t, unmovea|ble, always abounding in the &s;ervice of God, and of your generation. Cheri&s;h a warm attachment to the government, which you are called to ad|mini&s;ter, and do all the public good, which both the State and Federal Con&s;titutions require and en|able you to do. Guide this people in the integri|ty of your hearts, and by the &s;kilfulne&s;s of your hands. Exhibit before them a &s;hining example of piety and virtue; and employ all your honor and influence to promote their <HI>&s;piritual</HI> as well as tem|poral good. This wife and faithful di&s;charge of your public tru&s;ts, will finally put you into the full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that tran&s;porting promi&s;e, which is emphatically yours&mdash;"They that be wi&s;e &s;hall &s;hine as the brightne&s;s of the firmament; and they that turn many to righteou&s;ne&s;s, as the &s;tars for|ever and ever." But, if any of you &s;hould be con&s;cious to your&s;elves, that you have been un|faithful, unju&s;t, and unholy; let Daniel's coun&s;el be acceptable to you, and break off your &s;ins by righteou&s;ne&s;s, and your iniquities by &s;hewing mer|cy to the poor, that it may be a lengthening out of your tranquillity. For, it is mo&s;t certainly true, that, if you ca&s;t off fear, and re&s;train prayer before God, and de&s;pi&s;e all his warnings and admonitions, the day is coming, when that invi&s;ible hand, which is now recording all your deeds, will write on the table of your hearts, in a language which will need no interpreter, this final and fearful &s;entence: "You are weighed in the balances, and are found WANTING."</P>
