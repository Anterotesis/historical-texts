<P>Then the five men departed and came to Lai&s;h, and &s;aw the people that were therein, how they dwelt carele&s;s, after the manner of the Zidonians, quiet and &s;ecure; and there was no magi&s;trate in the land, that might put them to &s;hame in any thing; and they were far from the Zidonians, and had no bu&s;ine&s;s with any man.</P></Q>

<P>ALL Scripture is written for our in|&s;truction. It is intended not only to reveal to us the purpo&s;es of God's mercy and the requi&s;itions of his will, but to furni&s;h our minds with the wi&s;dom which is profitable to direct us in the various &s;ituations to which by Providence we are called. The hi&s;tory of the Bible contains a lively picture of human life and manners. It paints the various feelings which agitate the heart of man at different periods. It de&s;cribes the manner in which individuals and bodies of men have
<PB N="6" REF="026249_0004_0FCFAC03D3149908">
conducted in different circum&s;tances. It points out the motives of their conduct, and the con&s;equences which re&s;ulted from it. And thus the word of GOD furni&s;hes us with maxims of wi&s;dom, and le&s;&s;ons of ex|perience, without our paying the dear price at which they are &s;ometimes purcha&s;ed. From this hi&s;tory we find that mankind have been much the &s;ame in all ages; that the &s;ame pa&s;&s;ions and principles have actu|ated them all; and that the &s;ame effects have gene|rally re&s;ulted from the &s;ame cau&s;es.</P>
<P>MODERN philo&s;ophers are ready to &s;uppo&s;e that they have made great improvements in the knowledge of mankind, and in the various &s;y&s;tems by which hu|man governments may be formed and &s;upported with the mo&s;t happy &s;ucce&s;s. But if we read the hi&s;tory of the Bible, we &s;hall be ready to conclude with Sol|omon, "The thing that hath been, it is that which &s;hall be; and that which is done is that which &s;hall be done; and there is no new thing under the &s;un." In this hi&s;tory we &s;hall find the &s;ame general princi|ples laid down which are now con&s;idered as the ba|&s;is of free and happy &s;tates, and the &s;ame methods pre&s;cribed to pre&s;erve and increa&s;e them when they are formed. It is difficult to find any &s;ituation now to which there cannot be found &s;ome parallel in the &s;acred volume.</P>
<P>THE maxim, "that it is nece&s;&s;ary in peace to pre|pare for war," is now adopted by every human gov|ernment. Founded in rea&s;on and good &s;en&s;e, this maxim will be que&s;tioned by no one who does not doubt the lawfulne&s;s of war in all ca&s;es. Experience decides po&s;itively upon its truth, and the conduct of mankind proves their conviction of its expediency.
<PB N="7" REF="026249_0005_0FCFABFFE995FB18">
And a &s;triking example of the truth of this maxim is given us by the words of the text. The men of La|i&s;h were carele&s;s and &s;ecure; they had no order nor government; they con&s;idered them&s;elves as at a di&s;|tance from any enemy, and in no danger of an inva|&s;ion; and the&s;e very cau&s;es operated to incite the Danites to invade them, and rendered their conque&s;t ea&s;y and certain.</P>
<P>"LAISH," &s;ay commentators,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pool'<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"> Synop&s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter"></NOTE> "afterwards called Cae&s;area Philippi, was placed in a very plea&s;ant &s;itua|tion between the rivers Jor and Dan, almo&s;t at the foot of mount Libanus. This town was the extreme bor|der of Judea to the north, as Beer&s;heba was to the &s;outh. The inhabitants dwelt after the manner of the Zidonians. The city of Zidon was nearly &s;ur|rounded by the &s;ea; it was &s;trongly fortified, and thus its citizens felt perfectly &s;ecure. The Zidonians were a very powerful people, and had little to dread from any of the nations around them. This occa&s;ioned them to feel perfectly at ea&s;e; and the men of Lai&s;h, who were probably a colony from Zidon, catched the manners of the parent &s;tate, and without the &s;ame rea|&s;on felt the &s;ame &s;ecurity. They were di&s;tant a day's journey from Zidon, which was &s;ufficient to prevent them from receiving thence immediate a&s;&s;i&s;tance and &s;upport, in an attack &s;uddenly commenced and fin|i&s;hed. When the hi&s;tory &s;ays that they had no bu&s;i|ne&s;s with any man, it probably means that they did not carry on trade and commerce with any people, and lived entirely by them&s;elves; or el&s;e, that they had &s;o little care of their &s;afety, and &s;o high an opinion of their own abilities, as to form no league or alliance with any other people"</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="026249_0006_0FCF8C02E4F99B50">THE hi&s;tory to which the text relates is briefly this: The tribe of Dan had not conquered the whole por|tion of land a&s;&s;igned to them in Canaan; and being &s;traitened for room, they determined, by a vigorous exertion, to procure to them&s;elves the accommodation which they needed. They acted prudently and wi&s;ely in the pro&s;ecution of this de&s;ign; for, they did not at once commence an emigration without having any certain object before them, but detached a &s;mall party to find out a place adapted to their views, and a peo|ple that could be ea&s;ily conquered. Lai&s;h pre&s;ented it&s;elf to them as calculated to an&s;wer both the&s;e pur|po&s;es. The motives which induced the children of Dan to attack the place, and the rea&s;ons which made the conque&s;t &s;o ea&s;y, are briefly recounted in the re|port of the &s;pies:&mdash;"Ari&s;e, that ye may go up again&s;t them; for we have &s;een the land, and behold it is very good: And are ye &s;till? Be not &s;lothful to go and to enter to po&s;&s;e&s;s the land. When ye go, ye &s;hall come unto a people &s;ecure, and to a large land; for GOD hath given it into your hands&mdash;a place where there is no want of any thing that is in the earth." The fertility of the &s;oil, and the plea&s;antne&s;s of the &s;ituation, ani|mated their wi&s;hes to po&s;&s;e&s;s the land. The perfect &s;ecurity in which the people dwelt, and their total un|preparedne&s;s to defend them&s;elves, calmed their fears of any formidable re&s;i&s;tance. They came, they &s;aw, they conquered. And the people of Lai&s;h fell, a mel|ancholy proof of the danger of &s;ecurity, and a &s;triking demon&s;tration of the nece&s;&s;ity of preparing again&s;t violence and inva&s;ion, even in a time of the mo&s;t pro|found peace, and at the greate&s;t di&s;tance from any enemy.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="026249_0007_0FCFABFE50E276C8">THIS le&s;&s;on, &s;o &s;trikingly delineated in the hi&s;tory before us, is the le&s;&s;on of the day. We are now met in the hou&s;e of GOD to a&s;&s;i&s;t the devotions of an an|cient and re&s;pectable military Corps, founded by our ance&s;tors, to guard again&s;t the very error which proved fatal to the exi&s;tence and independence of Lai&s;h. This Corps was intended as a nur&s;ery for the officers who &s;hould command the militia of the colony, and who might thus train them up to "fight for their brethren, their &s;ons and their daughters, their wives and their hou&s;es." Deeply as the&s;e good men were impre&s;&s;ed with the peaceful religion of JESUS CHRIST, they &s;till believed the lawfulne&s;s and nece&s;&s;ity of defending the liberty and property which GOD had given them. Brave and hardy, like the wilderne&s;s which they &s;ub|dued, they could not endure the idea of yielding their independence even to the bolde&s;t invader; and there|fore by vigilance and exertion, by order and di&s;cipline, they guarded again&s;t the danger, or prepared them|&s;elves to repel it. They founded therefore this Com|pany, in which the principal men among them cheer|fully enrolled them&s;elves, and where the man who had commanded armies did not feel his honor injured, or his dignity impaired, by being commanded in his turn.</P>
<P>THE occa&s;ion therefore, and the &s;entiment of the text, lead me,</P>
<P>IN the fir&s;t place, to remark upon the folly which a people di&s;cover, and the danger to which they ex|po&s;e them&s;elves, when they live in a &s;tate of &s;ecurity, unprepared to re&s;i&s;t an inva&s;ion, or defend them&s;elves again&s;t the attacks of an enemy.</P>
<P>BUT how are we to defend our&s;elves when our coun|try is invaded, and we are threatened with the lo&s;s of
<PB N="10" REF="026249_0008_0FCFABFCD5901C70">
every thing we hold dear, by the violence and fury of an enemy? By declaring, with the hone&s;t Quaker, that we will not re&s;i&s;t any force which may come again&s;t us, becau&s;e our holy religion forbids us to fight? By long and learned and critical orations up|on the inju&s;tice and cruelty of inva&s;ion, and its incon|&s;i&s;tency with the rights of man? Shall we &s;end the mini&s;ters of religion to meet an army of invaders, and to tell them that they are not doing as they would be done by; that they act incon&s;i&s;tently with the religion of CHRIST, and that GOD will puni&s;h them for their inju&s;tice? Or, &s;hall we &s;pread out our &s;upplicating hands to them, and beg them not to &s;hed brethren's blood, nor deprive us of the liberty, the property and independence which GOD has be&s;towed upon us, and which we de&s;ire to tran&s;mit to our children?</P>
<P>WERE all mankind actuated by the peaceful relig|ion of JESUS CHRIST (as they will be at &s;ome future period) then the&s;e methods would be effectual; but under the pre&s;ent circum&s;tances of human nature they would be the &s;ubject only of deri&s;ion. So deeply is the human heart depraved, &s;o &s;trongly do ferocious pa&s;&s;ions operate upon mankind, as that the &s;till &s;mall voice of rea&s;on and religion cannot be heard. The loud calls of ambition and avarice drown their feeble whi&s;pers, and a torrent of violence and oppre&s;&s;ion &s;weep away their warme&s;t advocates.</P>
<P>IN the&s;e circum&s;tances, our only method is to re&s;i&s;t force with force, to repre&s;s the violence which we do not provoke, and to let men know that we will defend with our lives the liberty and the happine&s;s which GOD has given us.</P>
<P>BUT it is &s;trange, &s;ome will ob&s;erve, that doctrines of this nature &s;hould be preached by a mini&s;ter of
<PB N="11" REF="026249_0009_0FCFABF9B282B9A0">
peace, who profe&s;&s;es a religion which breathe the warme&s;t benevolence, and teaches mankind to live and love as brethren! Our ma&s;ter, will they &s;ay, "came not to de&s;troy men's lives, but to &s;ave them;" he &s;trictly prohibits every degree of wrath and envy, and enjoins us to follow peace with all men."</P>
<P>THE lawfulne&s;s of defen&s;ive war has been &s;o often proved from this place, upon the&s;e occa&s;ions, as that many ob&s;ervations upon the &s;ubject will be needle&s;s. We mu&s;t take mankind as they are, becau&s;e they will not be what they ought. We know that there are men, and many men, who are totally de&s;titute of moral principle, and care not whom they wound or de&s;troy, if they can enrich and aggrandize them&s;elves. We know that there are nations who wi&s;h to a&s;&s;ume univer&s;al authority, and &s;ubjugate their neighbours to their will. Can any man, in the exerci&s;e of common &s;en&s;e and rea&s;on, &s;uppo&s;e that the Go&s;pel prohibits us to re&s;i&s;t &s;uch violence? Am I obliged to deliver my pur&s;e to an highwayman, or my life to a murderer, when I am able to defend my&s;elf? Does the religion of CHRIST enjoin its votaries to &s;ubmit to the vio|lence of the fir&s;t ruffian nation which will attack them; to give up their liberty, and the liberty of their chil|dren, to tho&s;e who would make them "hewers of wood and drawers of water?" If my brother, agitated with a delirium, attempts to injure me, or take away my life, am I to yield my&s;elf a quiet victim to his di&s;trac|tion? The&s;e que&s;tions carry their own an&s;wer with them, and mu&s;t &s;trike conviction to every unpreju|diced mind; for to act in this manner will be to pre|&s;ent our throats to the butcher, and to court our own de&s;truction.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="026249_0010_0FCFABF7800FC710">WARS undertaken to gratify the lu&s;t of power, dif|ferences excited by tho&s;e "lu&s;ts from whence come wars and fightings among men," are decidedly con|trary to the law of GOD. Every good man mourns over tho&s;e fatal contentions where kindred blood is &s;hed; and where brethren of the &s;ame family, children of the &s;ame father "bite and devour one another." But where a people contend not for glory or conque&s;t; where they take every method to avoid an alternative &s;o di&s;agreeable; yet where they cannot pre&s;erve their lives, their liberties, their e&s;tates and their religion, without "re&s;i&s;ting unto blood," they are to do &s;o. If they do it not, they offend again&s;t GOD, and volun|tarily &s;acrifice the birthright which he has given them. GOD of old commanded his people to re&s;i&s;t &s;uch at|tempts, and to make war upon tho&s;e who attacked them; and would he have done this had war been un|lawful in all ca&s;es, and directly contrary to the nature and rea&s;on of things? I am aware that he permitted many things under former di&s;pen&s;ations "becau&s;e of the hardne&s;s of men's hearts," becau&s;e the &s;tate of hu|man nature would not permit them to be different; but then he never expre&s;sly <HI>enjoined</HI> men to do what was morally wrong? War he has enjoined; and Me|roz was cur&s;ed by divine command, becau&s;e they "came not to the help of the LORD, to the help of the LORD again&s;t the mighty."</P>
<P>IF it is lawful thus to defend our&s;elves, and if we have rea&s;on to expect the divine protection and &s;up|port only in the u&s;e of proper means, then it is cer|tainly wrong to neglect the&s;e means, and to live in a &s;tate of &s;upinene&s;s and &s;ecurity; becau&s;e di&s;cipline and military knowledge are ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ucce&s;s|ful war; and &s;uch di&s;cipline cannot be attained at
<PB N="13" REF="026249_0011_0FCFABF30EE41688">
once. All knowledge is progre&s;&s;ive, and military &s;kill is to be acquired in the &s;ame way, by the &s;ame exer|tions and per&s;everance which make us eminent in any other &s;cience. True it is, that native bravery and ar|dent enthu&s;ia&s;m will do much to animate men to he|roic deeds in defence of their country; but with how much greater advantage do the&s;e principles operate, when they are tempered with di&s;cretion, and guided by experience! The fir&s;t is the courage of a ma&s;tiff, who &s;huts his eyes, and runs into the very jaws of de|&s;truction, but who &s;ometimes bears all before him; the &s;econd is the fortitude of a man, who knows the nature of his object, and the means by which it may be accompli&s;hed. A nation free and brave cannot be conquered; but its defence mu&s;t co&s;t more dearly, and its di&s;tre&s;&s;es mu&s;t be greatly protracted, if its &s;ub|jects are not acquainted with the art of war. Ab&s;urd and fooli&s;h then it is, for any people to live in &s;ecurity, to flatter them&s;elves that their tranquillity &s;hall not be interrupted, and to remain ignorant of military di&s;ci|pline! They act unwi&s;ely when they do not learn the art of defending them&s;elves, until that defence is im|mediately nece&s;&s;ary; and when they tru&s;t to their ene|my's beating them into &s;kill, and in&s;tructing them to be &s;oldiers, as the "men of Succoth were taught with briers and thorns."</P>
<P>IT is certainly unwi&s;e, again, for a people to live in &s;ecurity, without preparing again&s;t inva&s;ion until that inva&s;ion takes place, becau&s;e exertions for defence &s;ud|denly made will not be &s;o effectual, nor an&s;wer the &s;ame purpo&s;e with tho&s;e which are made coolly and with time. If fortre&s;&s;es are &s;uddenly erected, they will want &s;trength and firmne&s;s. If an army is rai&s;ed, and they are called to fight before they have been in|&s;tructed
<PB N="14" REF="026249_0012_0FCFABF194B4DB88">
in the fir&s;t rudiments of war, they will proba|bly be defeated. Ha&s;te is no friend to wi&s;e coun&s;els or to effectual defence. The &s;pur of the occa&s;ion may animate to vigorous exertions for a &s;hort time, and de&s;pair may lead a rude and undi&s;ciplined multi|tude to do wonderful things; but their violence will &s;oon put them out of breath, and a cool and wary en|emy will be able gradually to defeat and di&s;per&s;e them. In the&s;e ca&s;es, as in all others, &s;kill and knowl|edge will make hard things ea&s;y, and will &s;ave much labour and pains. By a wi&s;e and judicious mode of defence, not ha&s;tily adopted, but carefully adju&s;ted in all its various parts, much damage may be prevented, and many valuable lives may be &s;aved. What wi&s;e people then will neglect, even in the bo&s;om of tran|quillity, to guard again&s;t every &s;urpri&s;e, and prepare them&s;elves to re&s;i&s;t the fir&s;t bold intruder who may attack them!</P>
<P>NO people can have any ground for &s;ecurity while they are de&s;titute of the means of defence. They lie open to every danger, and are liable to be in&s;ulted, abu&s;ed and conquered, by any nation which may think them worthy of their attention. Such a &s;tate ought to excite alarm, and no people &s;hould be ea&s;y while they are expo&s;ed to danger &s;o imminent. But their li&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s, like that of a man in a lethargy, com|monly increa&s;es with their di&s;ea&s;e, and generally ter|minates in the death of their liberty.</P>
<P>BUT, preparations made in peace, and an ability to re&s;i&s;t inva&s;ion are, thirdly, the mo&s;t effectual means to prevent it. Their neighbours will e&s;teem it madne&s;s and folly to expo&s;e them&s;elves to &s;uch a formidable re&s;i&s;tance; and a people thus prepared and di&s;ciplined
<PB N="15" REF="026249_0013_0FCFABF01800BAC8">
will be an object, not only of veneration, but of fear. Marauders, tyrants who wi&s;h to carry their de&s;poti&s;m into foreign countries, or to fatten on their &s;poils, will not choo&s;e for their objects tho&s;e hardy and &s;kilful nations, who &s;tand ready to defend them&s;elves and their country. Such men will look, as did the tribe of Dan, for &s;ome people who dwell quiet and &s;ecure, without vigilance, without di&s;cipline or the means of re&s;i&s;tance. Such a people court inva&s;ion, they invite an attack, and beckon to tho&s;e who delight in &s;poil to "come and take away their place and nation." Wary and prudent commanders will confider long before they attack a fortre&s;s &s;trongly fortified and well gar|ri&s;oned; and they will count the co&s;t before they in|vade a country who&s;e inhabitants are all trained to di&s;|cipline, and "know how to u&s;e the &s;word and the bow." But the weakne&s;s of a fortre&s;s, the ignorance or &s;ecurity of a people, mark them as proper &s;ubjects to be attacked and conquered.</P>
<P>RESPECTABILITY always attends the vigilance and di&s;cipline which I am recommending. It is a proof of wi&s;dom to look forward and prepare for futu|rity, to guard again&s;t any danger which may ari&s;e, and to provide remedies for every di&s;a&s;ter which may hap|pen. Such conduct is a proof of a healthy and vig|orous &s;tate; it di&s;covers energy in council, and an ela&s;tic well braced government. This people will &s;tand high in the e&s;timation of the world. Their al|liance will be courted, and this will give them new &s;trength and new defences. The &s;aying of our Lord, alluding however to a more important circum&s;tance, will in this ca&s;e be fully accompli&s;hed&mdash;"Unto him that hath &s;hall be given, and he &s;hall have abundance, but from him that hath not &s;hall be taken even that which he &s;eemeth to have."</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="026249_0014_0FCF8BFFE7EE3AA0">THE hi&s;tory of mankind will furni&s;h us with num|berle&s;s in&s;tances wherein the truth of the&s;e ob&s;erva|tions has been exemplified. Scarcely a page of this hi&s;tory can be opened which does not contain full con|viction of it. But we need not go from our own age or our own times to find this conviction. The people of America have proved it to the world, and have reaped the happy con&s;equences of vigilance and di&s;ci|pline, as well as of per&s;onal bravery. At the com|mencement of our late controver&s;y with one of the mo&s;t formidable nations upon earth, we had not the means of defence which other nations enjoy. We were without ammunition, without money, and with|out allies; but we had an hardy yeomanry, zealous in the cau&s;e of liberty, and ver&s;ed from their infancy in the u&s;e of arms. Every man had been more or le&s;s trained and di&s;ciplined; and we had a general ac|quaintance with military &s;cience. We proved the benefit of this preparation, when we met the embat|tled legions of Britain, and &s;pread terror through ho&s;ts commanded by their able&s;t Generals. The heights of Charle&s;town witne&s;&s;ed the bravery of our citizens, and furni&s;hed a convincing evidence of the wi&s;dom of tho&s;e in&s;titutions which made the people of New England &s;oldiers from their cradle. Superior as were our foes in equipments, "in all the pomp and circum|&s;tance of war," yet &s;till they paid &s;o dearly for their victory as that the acqui&s;ition of one or two more &s;uch victories would have ruined them.</P>
<P>AND how deplorable would have been our &s;itua|tion, had we not been thus in&s;tructed and prepared for defence! Attacked by an enemy who claimed a right to "bind us in all ca&s;es what&s;oever," and who&s;e high toned &s;pirits were exa&s;perated at the idea of re|&s;i&s;tance,
<PB N="17" REF="026249_0015_0FCFABEE86D0A4E8">
we mu&s;t have fallen a prey to their violence, and bidden an everla&s;ting farewell to liberty and its ble&s;&s;ings. Ta&s;kma&s;ters, wor&s;e than Egyptian, would have been &s;et over us, and our children mu&s;t have toil|ed to &s;upport the luxury of their oppre&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P>BUT when re&s;i&s;tance had taken place, and we had declared our&s;elves independent, what mi&s;eries, what exqui&s;ite di&s;tre&s;&s;es would have been the probable con|&s;equences of our &s;ubjugation! An incen&s;ed &s;oldiery would have given way to their unhallowed lu&s;ts, and di&s;regarded the laws of GOD and man to gratify their cravings! Alas!&mdash;what &s;ound is this which pierces my heart? It is the &s;hrieks of a tender wife, wre&s;ted from the arms of a beloved hu&s;band, to gratify the ap|petite of a lordly ma&s;ter!&mdash;But whence are tho&s;e &s;oft complainings, tho&s;e deep drawn &s;ighs? They are the lamentations of injured innocence, of violated virtue, of the defiled virgin, who has fallen a victim to brutal force!&mdash;But why does bu&s;y imagination tran&s;port me to a &s;cene &s;till more painful? Why does it hurry me to the field of blood, the place of execution for the friends of American liberty? Whom does it there call me to &s;ee led to the &s;caffold with the dignity of Cato, the fortitude of Brutus, and the gentlene&s;s of Cicero marked deeply on his countenance? It is the gallant WASHINGTON, de&s;erted by his countrymen, and &s;ac|rificed becau&s;e he fought in their defence!&mdash;Of whom con&s;i&s;ts yonder group of heroes? It is an HANCOCK, an ADAMS one and the other, a FRANKLIN, a RUT|LEDGE!&mdash;but I repre&s;s the bur&s;ting &s;entiment&mdash;the bare imagination bows my &s;oul with unutterable grief!</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="026249_0016_0FCFABE9778B6BE0">THANKS to the GOD of armies, and to the vigi|lance and bravery of our countrymen&mdash;the&s;e di&s;tre&s;&s;|ing &s;cenes were never realized! Freedom, peace and independence have ble&s;&s;ed our land; and the very na|tion whom we oppo&s;ed, laying a&s;ide the bitterne&s;s of civil contention, has extended to us a friendly hand, and now declares her&s;elf happy in our alliance. A re|currence to pa&s;t &s;cenes &s;hould not therefore excite our re&s;entment; it &s;hould only animate us to the vigi|lance, the bravery, and the active preparation which proved, under GOD, the means of our deliverance.</P>
<P>I PROCEED to remark, fourthly, on the nece&s;&s;ity of government to the exi&s;tence and defence of any people.</P>
<P>ONE rea&s;on a&s;&s;igned for the ea&s;y conque&s;t of Lai&s;h is, "that there was no magi&s;trate in the land, who might put them to &s;hame in any thing,"&mdash;who could puni&s;h them for doing wrong, or make any man a&s;hamed of his want of virtue or patrioti&s;m. Such a people mu&s;t fall an ea&s;y prey to an invader; for with|out government no people can remain in &s;ecurity, nor can any nation be defended from its enemies.</P>
<P>BY re&s;training vice, the magi&s;trate prevents men from contracting habits of effeminacy. He guards them from weakne&s;s of mind, and excites them to hardihood and patrioti&s;m. The great and noble prin|ciples of love to our country, of &s;acrificing private in|tere&s;t to public happine&s;s, of guarding the rights of po&s;terity, and di&s;&s;eminating univer&s;al felicity, cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t in a mind narrowed and depraved by criminal indulgence. Vice makes cowards of mankind. It contracts and &s;tifles the noble&s;t principles of human action, and renders men abject in their &s;entiments and conduct. As far as vice is di&s;countenanced, as far as
<PB N="19" REF="026249_0017_0FCFABE7CE257D90">
men are made a&s;hamed of doing ba&s;e and unworthy actions,&mdash;&s;o far general &s;ecurity is increa&s;ed, and the aggregate of national &s;trength is enlarged.</P>
<P>THE de&s;ign of good government is to form a focus to which all the diverging rays of power in a commu|nity may be collected, and which may enable a people to bring the force of the whole to one point. This accumulated power protects every individual in his rights; it guards the weak from the violence of the &s;trong, and the few from the oppre&s;&s;ion of the many. The &s;ame power is competent to defend the whole from inva&s;ion or other injury. Nothing can be done by way of defence where there is no government. Money cannot be rai&s;ed. Men cannot be di&s;ciplin|ed&mdash;nor can any great object be &s;teadily pur&s;ued. When a people without government are invaded, ev|ery man will propo&s;e and pur&s;ue his own mode of de|fence. A thou&s;and different &s;chemes will be thrown out. The people will be di&s;tracted in their views; and before this di&s;traction can be calmed, a final con|que&s;t may &s;ave them the trouble of defending them|&s;elves for the future. A nation rent with divi&s;ions, de&s;titute of law, of &s;ubordination and rulers, pre&s;ents a proper object for an attack, becau&s;e it promi&s;es an ea&s;y if not a valuable conque&s;t. The very people them|&s;elves who have been agitated by different &s;cenes, who have no re&s;t for the &s;oles of their feet, who find their lives, their liberties and e&s;tates afloat, and expo&s;ed to the lawle&s;s violence of any who may be plea&s;ed to &s;eize them,&mdash;this people them&s;elves will join an invading army, and prefer any &s;ecurity, any protection to none at all. Without government, indeed, without law and order, there is no liberty, no &s;ecurity, no peace nor pro&s;perity. Men ought to guard their rights;
<PB N="20" REF="026249_0018_0FCFABE68537E060">
they ought to re&s;i&s;t arbitiary power of every kind; they ought to e&s;tabli&s;h a free government;&mdash;but no people can be &s;afe, no nation can be happy where "every man does what is right in his own eyes," and the people are driven about by the whirlwind of their pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>IF, again, a government is free and ju&s;t, they will be cheerfully &s;upported by the people in defending their country. Wars too often ari&s;e from the ambi|tion or other pa&s;&s;ions of princes and great men, and the ju&s;tice of them may be properly doubted. Where an intere&s;t exi&s;ts in the government &s;eparate from that of the people, the latter will always feel a jealou&s;y, and will not be ready to give them effectual &s;upport. But where "our rulers are from among our&s;elves, and our governors proceed from the mid&s;t of us;" where every man, elevated as his &s;tation may be, returns at &s;tated periods to the ma&s;s of the people; where our rulers cannot injure us without hurting them&s;elves,&mdash;we may cheerfully acquie&s;ce in their calls to defend our|&s;elves, and may be &s;ure that they will not wantonly engage in a war, which expo&s;es them as well as us to heavy expen&s;e and grievous misfortune. The con&s;ci|entious &s;oldier, who will not &s;upport a war which he does not believe to be lawful, may here feel his mind perfectly at ea&s;e, and may di&s;cover his &s;kill and his fortitude in defending his injured country, or &s;upport|ing its ju&s;t claims. Happy people, who are ble&s;&s;ed with &s;uch a government! Happy land, &s;hadowed all around with the tree of liberty, and yet &s;trengthened and united by a firm and vigorous government! No wonder that thou art envied by other nations, who are either cru&s;hed by arbitrary power, or di&s;tre&s;&s;ed by confu&s;ion and anarchy!</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="026249_0019_0FCFABE50EDC4A70">THE rea&s;ons again&s;t indulging to &s;ecurity, and neg|lecting to provide for defence, I ob&s;erve once more, op|erate with peculiar force upon a people who&s;e di&s;tant &s;ituation prevents their receiving a&s;&s;i&s;tance from their allies. The people of Lai&s;h were far from the Zido|nians, and had no bu&s;ine&s;s or connexion with any man. The &s;acred hi&s;torian informs us al&s;o, that the Danites came "unto Lai&s;h, unto a people that were at quiet and &s;ecure, and they &s;mote them with the edge of the &s;word, and burnt the city with fire, and there was no deliverer, becau&s;e it was far from Zidon." If a people dwelling thus remotely do not defend and help them&s;elves, no one can help them. Before their friends and allies can hear of their di&s;tre&s;s, it may be complete; and they may be &s;ubdued and ruined be|fore the lea&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;tance can be given them. This con|&s;ideration &s;hould operate &s;trongly upon a nation thus &s;ituated, and induce them to keep them&s;elves in a con&s;tant &s;tate of defence; to cultivate military &s;kill and di&s;cipline among the inhabitants; to be provided with all the means of defence; to keep a vigilant eye upon the &s;tate of all nations, &s;o that they may not be &s;urpri&s;ed on a &s;udden; and to put all their fortre&s;&s;es into &s;uch a condition, as that they may be able to check a &s;udden attack, and give time for the people, the natural bulwarks of the State, to a&s;&s;emble and re|&s;i&s;t their daring invaders.</P>
<P>THE pa&s;t di&s;cour&s;e, you mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible, hath had a re&s;pect to the &s;ituation of this country, and the duty of this day. We, my fellow citizens, dwell in a di&s;|tant part of the world, far removed from any allies, and very little intere&s;ted in the politics of Europe. This circum&s;tance &s;hould not only operate to excite us to pay a clo&s;e attention to the &s;tate of our militia,
<PB N="22" REF="026249_0020_0FCFABE381AAC5E8">
and the means of our defence, but it &s;hould prevent us from engaging in their quarrels, or adopting their wars. Our a&s;&s;i&s;tance can be of very little benefit to them, but it may e&s;&s;entially injure us. Our country is young, and cannot bear the lo&s;s of men, which is the certain con&s;equence of war. It is free, and does not wi&s;h its citizens to mix with the &s;laves of Europe, and catch their &s;ervile manners. It venerates relig|ion, and will find no advantage, &s;hould its people a&s;|&s;ociate with tho&s;e who de&s;pi&s;e religion, and trample upon every divine law. In ca&s;e of a war, we cannot be &s;upported or a&s;&s;i&s;ted by any European power as they can &s;upport one another; and America may be e&s;&s;en|tially injured before our allies in Europe can know that an enemy has attacked us. GOD in his provi|dence has placed us in a remote part of the world, and if our brethren in other countries "fall out by the way," we will endeavour to reconcile them, but we will not become partners in their quarrels. They have a right to choo&s;e their own governments, and manage their own affairs, without our interference. GOD does not call us to war. We are not attacked nor endangered; until we are, we have no right to &s;pill our own blood, or that of our children. Let us then "&s;tudy the things that make for peace." Let us unite in repre&s;&s;ing tho&s;e re&s;tle&s;s &s;pirits who cannot &s;ee a quarrel going on without in&s;erting them&s;elves in it. Let us be ready con&s;tantly to exert our good offices in bringing about peace; and let us devoutly pray that GOD would ha&s;ten the time when "wars &s;hall cea&s;e from the earth," and the peaceful kingdom of JESUS CHRIST, which breathes nothing but good will to men, &s;hall univer&s;ally prevail.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="026249_0021_0FCFABE0C227BA30">THROUGH the goodne&s;s of GOD, America now en|joys a great degree of peace. She has pa&s;&s;ed through an arduous conte&s;t, and having &s;truggled long with formidable di&s;tre&s;&s;es, &s;he is effectually relieved; and while &s;he breathen the pure and fragrant air of lib|erty, her pro&s;perity rapidly increa&s;es, and her branches extend far and wide. On our frontiers indeed a cloud, not bigger than a man's hand, has ari&s;en, and has ex|tended to a formidable and di&s;tre&s;&s;ing degree. Our armies have been defeated, and we mourn the brave men who have fallen in the wilderne&s;s, and who&s;e bones are now whitening in the &s;un. It is not for me to determine upon the nece&s;&s;ity or expedience of this war. As a mini&s;ter of religion, I can only wi&s;h and pray for peace, and anticipate the time when "the &s;word of the wilderne&s;s" &s;hall de&s;troy no more.</P>
<P>IF, my brethren, we mean to guard our&s;elves from inva&s;ion, and to lengthen out our tranquillity, we mu&s;t cultivate a good government; we mu&s;t reverence the laws, and &s;upport the magi&s;trate in "putting to &s;hame tho&s;e that do evil." It is a duty enjoined by our holy religion to &s;ubmit to &s;uch government and it is a maxim founded in eternal truth, that no people can be conquered or de&s;troyed who are united in &s;upport|ing a free and good con&s;titution. A con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of being freemen, of being protected in the enjoyment of life and property, by laws which know not the rich from the poor, or the great from the &s;mall; this con|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s will give men elevation of &s;entiment; it will in&s;pire them with fortitude and per&s;everance, and make them &s;uperior to all the &s;laves and &s;ycophants upon earth.</P>
<P>WHILE we &s;upport our various con&s;titutions of government, and guard again&s;t inte&s;tine divi&s;ions&punc; we
<PB N="24" REF="026249_0022_0FCFABDBC99068F8">
ought to pay a &s;trict attention to the &s;tate of our mi|litia, and the other means of defence. Americans will never &s;uffer a &s;tanding army among them in time of peace. The militia are the natural defenders of this country. They have a &s;take in it. They have a &s;hare in its &s;overeignty; and they fight for their wives, their children, their liberty, and their all. Such men cannot be cowards; they mu&s;t be brave and deter|mined; and when any of the&s;e ble&s;&s;ings are taken from them, or threatened to be done away, they will be "like a bear robbed of her whelps," and will deter|mine to conquer or die.</P>
<P>BUT this very ardor and impetuo&s;ity may be fatal to them, unle&s;s they are under the direction of judg|ment and di&s;cipline. The&s;e are nece&s;&s;ary to check their efferve&s;cences, and lead their efforts to &s;uch points as may be mo&s;t beneficial. Our militia then &s;hould be di&s;ciplined. Our young men &s;hould be early in|&s;tructed in the art of war, and every one &s;hould hold him&s;elf in readine&s;s to "play the man for his people, and the cities of his GOD." Let us have our fortre&s;&s;es in good repair, and be ready at all points to re&s;i&s;t an inva&s;ion; and this is the mo&s;t likely method to pre|vent it.</P>
<P>YOUR in&s;titution, Gentlemen of the Ancient and Honorable Artillery Company, is de&s;igned to an&s;wer this important purpo&s;e, and is a &s;triking proof of the wi&s;dom and fore&s;ight of our ance&s;tors. Venerable men! My heart warms when I view the &s;chools, the colleges, the churches which they founded; and when I &s;ee this Company a&s;&s;embled, &s;o admirably adapted "upon all our glory to create a defence." Methinks I &s;ee them looking down from the &s;eats of bli&s;s, &s;mil|ing

to behold this favourite in&s;titution flouri&s;hing and increa&s;ing; delighting them&s;elves in the good of which they thus laid the foundation, and charging us to tran&s;mit the freedom and happine&s;s which they have given us, a fair and a large inheritance to the late&s;t po&s;terity!</P>
<P>YOU are citizens, Gentlemen, as well as &s;oldiers, and you know the nece&s;&s;ity of order and government. The&s;e you will feel it your duty to &s;upport and pre|&s;erve, while you value and defend the liberty of your country. You know that the&s;e duties do not inter|fere. You know that without government freedom cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t, becau&s;e government alone can protect the helple&s;s individual, or re&s;train the lordly tyrant. You know al&s;o that a free government is nece&s;&s;ary to animate and direct the efforts of a people in their own defence, and that the tree of liberty never flouri&s;hes, unle&s;s it is pre&s;erved from rude violence by the &s;acred barriers of law and ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>COUNTENANCED by the Commander in chief, who him&s;elf formerly led a corps in &s;ome re&s;pects &s;imilar to your own, and encouraged by the good wi&s;hes and plaudits of your fellow citizens, you are becoming every year more u&s;eful and re&s;pectable. The choice which you have made of men to command you, who have known not only the parade, but the reality of war, and have bravely defended the liberties of Amer|ica, has done you and your country honor. Men of the fir&s;t abilities have been heretofore the objects of your choice; and I hope that the elections of this day will prove, that you are &s;till governed by the &s;ame wi&s;|dom and prudence, which in this re&s;pect have hereto|fore marked your conduct.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="026249_0024_0FCFABD92A30EB28">SHOULD you be called to defend your country, or protect its rights, I have no doubt but that you would prove your military &s;kill to be impediment to brave and valorous exertions. Sure I am, that you would never turn your backs to an enemy, or &s;uffer your|&s;elves to be defeated. You are Americans. You are de&s;cendants of men, who &s;acrificed every thing to a&s;|&s;ert their liberty. Many of you have "jeoparded your lives on the high places of the field," and your bo&s;oms glow with genuine patrioti&s;m. Such men are invinci|ble. Nothing can &s;ubdue them but the power of that Being who hath declared, "that the race is not always to the &s;wift, nor the battle to the &s;trong."</P>
<P>GO on, Gentlemen, and pro&s;per. In peace prepare for war. Cultivate in your own brea&s;ts, and impre&s;s upon your children, an ardent love to civil and relig|ious liberty. And while you di&s;charge your duty to &s;ociety, forget not the Being who has made you what you are, at who&s;e tribunal you mu&s;t all &s;tand, and who&s;e "favour is better than life." If you &s;ubmit to his Go&s;pel, and are governed in heart and in life by its precepts, you &s;hall be made "more than conquerors;" your brows &s;hall be adorned with unfading laurels, and your triumphs &s;hall be complete and eternal!</P>
