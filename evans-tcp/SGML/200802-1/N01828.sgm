<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Have peru&s;ed your Letter, Intituled, <HI>The Di&s;tre&s;&s;ed State of the Town of Bo&s;ton,</HI> and think the Ti|tle doth an&s;wer the Matters of Fact therein con|tained; which are too obvious to every Man to be deny'd, and therefore I believe all Men will be of Opinion that it was high time &s;ome body did begin, and &s;hew the Poverty and Oppre&s;&s;ion which is breaking in like a Flood upon us. I have lately Travell'd into livers parts of the Country, and convers'd with many Principle Men there, and find them all to be very diffe|rent in Opinion from tho&s;e who have pretended to give An&s;wer to yours in the News-Letter, the 18th of <HI>April,</HI> and &s;ince in a Pamphlet dated 23d. of &s;ame Month, In|tituled, <HI>Some Remarks on yours,</HI> and indeed I think the Author did well to put in the Word, Some: for tho&s;e Things which there was mo&s;t need of clearing up, he hath not thought proper to touch upon, perhaps he &s;aw he was not able to give any &s;atisfactory An&s;wer thereto, and &s;o thought (as any wi&s;e Man would) that it would be mo&s;t prudent to pa&s;s them over in &s;ilence, and indeed no Man of common under&s;tanding, who compares your Letter with the pretended An&s;wers will &s;ay, that the An&s;wers any way clear up the Difficulties you complain of. So that your Letter &s;tands good, and will do &s;o in the Opinion of every Judicious Reader, until a clearer and fuller An&s;wer appear. I have al&s;o &s;een a piece of
<PB N="4" REF="002163_0004_0FBC790F359F2470">
&s;ulled paper, Intituled, <HI>The Po&s;tcript,</HI> which I ha&s;tily ran over, but thought it not worth while to give it a &s;econd reading, being &s;en&s;ible that none but &s;ome very mean wretch could be &s;o &s;imple to think the Cau&s;e (of which he would be thought a Patron) could receive any benefit by the railing of &s;uch a <HI>Rab&s;hica.</HI> However, I put it in my Pocket, thinking it might &s;erve (as dirty as it was,) for a nece&s;&s;ary occa&s;ion; but Sir, I can a&s;&s;ure you, you'l &s;uffer nothing by &s;uch Scurrility, for I find you are ju&s;tifyed by Men of every Rank and Order, and it is the cry of (by far the greate&s;t part) both of Town and Country, that your Letter was a word in &s;ea&s;on, and that you have done well in appearing in this critical Juncture.</P>
<P>I think it no Difficult matter to An&s;wer the An&s;wer's, but it will take up too much of my Time, and indeed what they have written, are mo&s;tly Eva&s;ions, Mi&s;re|pre&s;entations and Amu&s;ements, and perhaps &s;ome Mi&s;takes, to which the Gentleman owns he is as liable as you are. He &s;aith you have repre&s;ented Things in a &s;mart and moving manner, by which I perceive he thought that the Town felt the Truth of what you have written, and therefore would readily fall in with it; This &s;eems to be his great fear and perplexity thro' the whole Epi&s;tle, and therefore he &s;aith your heart waxed hot within you, and inliven'd and &s;harpen'd your Expre&s;&s;ion: Though I confe&s;s I don't &s;ee you have exceeded that way any more than the nature of the Thing required; for it being &s;o Melancholy a Theame you were upon, I think it look'd well enough to &s;hew your Re&s;entments again&s;t &s;ome Evils you complain of by a &s;uitable warmth of Expre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>As to the ill u&s;e which have been made of our Province Bills, and the unhappy Con&s;equences re&s;ulting therefrom, I &s;hall not run into the Argument, it being nothing to the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e, but I can't but ob&s;erve that it is the Opinion of every Body I hear di&s;cour&s;e on that Subject, that the Province Bills received their
<PB N="5" REF="002163_0005_0FBC7910B94E45D8">
deadly wound the Day they were fir&s;t invented, but had they been then made a lawful Tender, or had there been then a Law made that no Man &s;hould have been Impri&s;oned who tendered the Province Bills for &s;atisfaction, the Poor Men who received 'em for Wages in the <HI>Canada</HI> Expedition would not have lo&s;t Fifty per Cent, by them: And indeed I am of Opinion if Merchants had then made a Bank, and given out their Bills, the&s;e Poor Men would have fared much better then they did with the Province Bills, for the Merchants would have been for &s;upporting the Credit of their own Bills, whereas it was their Intere&s;t to run down the value of the Publick Bills, in order to get Money by them; and this hath always been the great Argument with me why a Private Bank mu&s;t be better than a Publick; A Private Bank would be in the hands of a multitude of Men who&s;e Intere&s;t it would be to &s;upport the Credit of there Bills, whereas it is and always will be the intere&s;t of every private Man to undervalue the Publick Bills, by &s;elling his Silver to the highe&s;t bidder: And it is this in a great mea&s;ure that hath rai&s;ed the price of Silver to <HI>Twelve Shillings</HI> per Ounce.</P>
<P>I am fully of the Gentlemans mind, that the Di&s;tre&s;&s;ed State of the Trade of <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> is not owing to the want of Province Bills, for I &s;ay it was an unhappy Day wherein they were fir&s;t invented, but the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed State of the Town of <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> which is what you talk of, is owing to the want of &s;ome better Medium of Exchange, and I am &s;ure you are right in &s;aying, that it is impo&s;&s;ible the Town or Country can &s;ub&s;i&s;t without &s;ome Medium or other, And Two Hundred Thou&s;and Pounds in this large Country is but as a &s;prat in a Whales Belly; One would think there could not be le&s;s that that in the Countrymans Che&s;ts to buy Land with.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="002163_0006_0FBC79124A3845A0">The Gentleman don't wonder the Trade of <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> declines, and expects it will yet do &s;o, And I am of his Opinion. He &s;aith &s;everal other Places in this and other Provinces are got into a foreign Trade of late; But he dont tells us that our Burthening Trade with heavy Duties, hath been in a great mea&s;ure the cau&s;e of it, whil&s;t our Neighbours court Trade, and endea|vour to encourage the Trader, and find their Account therein, for by under-&s;elling us they &s;upply tho&s;e Pla|ces who formerly depended on us, &s;o that we have lo&s;t the advantage we formerly reap'd by &s;upplying our Neighbours, and tho&s;e al&s;o who they now &s;upply.</P>
<P>But the Gentleman makes a great noi&s;e about our giving <HI>Twelve Shillings</HI> per Ounce for Silver, and &s;aith we have Province Bills to buy up all the produce of the Country and all the Silver and Gold be&s;ides; By which I find he knows little of Trade of this Country. As to the Silver and Gold, I &s;uppo&s;e a &s;mall Sum of Money will buy up all that comes in; I don't believe there is <HI>Three Thou&s;and Pounds</HI> per Annum, comes into the Province, &s;o that could it all be kept and not a Penny Ship'd off again, unle&s;s it came in fa&s;ter then it doth now, we &s;hould not have Silver enough for a Medium to manage our Trade, in le&s;s then Two or Three Hun|dred Years. But further I mu&s;t tell that Gentleman, that if the Fi&s;h which is made in the Country in one Year lay in one Pile, and all our Province Bills in another, I am of opinion that the Bills would not be &s;ufficient to pay for that one Article, &s;o va&s;tly &s;hort is the Gentleman in his Computation.</P>
<P>The Gentleman &s;eems very much concern'd at your touching upon the Law made to &s;horten Credit. I find it is a tender point by the Treatment you have lately met with on that account; and therefore I &s;hall wave it, and only &s;ay, That in my apprehen&s;ion no Man could have
<PB N="7" REF="002163_0007_0FBC79151984F580">
ju&s;tify'd the good intentions of the Government more than you have done; you only &s;hew the Advantages &s;ome People have taken therefrom to oppre&s;s their Neighbours, and your An&s;werer don't deny the Truth of what you a&s;&s;ert. I hope none will blame you for comparing it with the Scriptures, that being the Eternal Rule of Righteou&s;ne&s;s, by which we mu&s;t all be ju&s;tify'd or condemn'd.</P>
<P>The Gentleman &s;eems afraid that every Bodies Belly is not full of the Publick Bank, but I am fully of your Opinion that it is &s;o; And joyn al&s;o with your An&s;werer that it never did no good; and add further, nor never will do any: For which Rea&s;on I hope if ever we have any more Bills, they will be on another foot, and as that Gentleman &s;aith, they imagine a vain Thing who think the Loan Money they have Borrow'd will be paid by the Province. I think it very unju&s;t for any to de&s;ire it, and very idle for 'em to expect it.</P>
<P>The Gentleman tells us, That the Silver and Gold will always be Bought up and Shipp'd off while we have &s;uch plenty of Bills. As if the plenty of Bills were the cau&s;e thereof, no my Friend, it is the &s;carcity of Returns is the cau&s;e. He does not con&s;ider we have lo&s;t our Bay Trade, which was a great Article in our Returns. Our <HI>Newfoundland</HI> Trade and other Branches are in a great mea&s;ure cut off by the high Prizes our Provi&s;ions bare here of late, and this hath run up the Prizes of Re|turns, and the rea&s;on European Goods are &s;o high of late, is (1) Becau&s;e there is not near &s;o many Imported as formerly, though the Country is growing daily, and Expends va&s;tly, and (2) The Scarcity of Returns help al&s;o to keep up their Prizes, and what Silver comes in is ac|counted as Merchandize, and Bought up as other Returns are, and &s;o hath been for a long time. We all know that there hath not been any Silver pa&s;&s;ing in Pay <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> the&s;e many Years.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="002163_0008_0FBC791710708EA0">The Gentleman tells us, That there is a Cry made of hoarding up the Bills at &s;ome Convenient Sea&s;ons, but don't &s;ay what Sea&s;ons tho&s;e are, &s;o that we are left in the dark as to that matter. But he goes on and talks of the Merchants hoarding up the Bills to buy Silver, and putting off there Tradesmen with Goods, and keeping 'em out of their Money part with this Excu&s;e, that the Bills are hoarded up; as if it were the Men who employ'd the Poor who hoard up the Bills, But I mu&s;t tell the Gentleman, it is not tho&s;e who are concerned in Shipping and employ the greate&s;t part of the Town that drive this Trade; it is a Sett of Men among us who live only by Buying up Bills of Exchange, and Silver and Gold, and bid upon one another, and &s;o advance the Exchange, and the Price of Silver and Gold al&s;o, and the&s;e are the Men who Import the fineries and gue gaus he &s;peaks of, who indeed &s;erve more to hurt us than to help us.</P>
<P>Well, I find the only Project the Gentleman can contrive for a Medium of Exchange to pa&s;s among&s;t us is, To leave of tru&s;ting, That he tells us will do the Bu&s;ine&s;s; But I can put him in a way which will do our Bu&s;ine&s;s much &s;ooner, and a way as likely to take Effect and that is to leave off Eating, Drinking, and Wearing, and then there will be an end of Buying and Selling, and this is as likely for &s;uch a Place as this, or indeed any other Place who lives by Trade, to live without Tru&s;ting. Perhaps the Gentleman is a Sallary Man, and &s;o don't know much about Tru&s;ting: But if &s;o I believe I may venture to tell him, if we have not &s;ome Medium or other contrived, Sallary Men will feel it as much as others very quickly.</P>

<PB N="9" REF="002163_0009_0FBC791843FC9588">
be thought to drive that matter too far: I only far, That I always was and &s;till am of your Opinion, that a Private Bank under the In&s;pection of the Government would have been much better than the way we have been in, and &s;o you &s;ay in your Letter; you there propo&s;e that the Government &s;hould Encourage and Support it by &s;uitable Laws, whith takes off the Force of the An&s;werers great Objection again&s;t it, Viz. That it will be in the Power of the Bankers to accompli&s;h any of their own private De&s;igns, without the Governments being able to re&s;train 'em.</P>
<P>But I find the Gentleman mi&s;takes your Propo&s;al of Fortifying our Expo&s;ed Settlements, and &s;aith, Peoples going into New Plantations where they could not rai&s;e their own Provi&s;ions hath rai&s;ed the Price with us, and &s;o far he is right: But you only propo&s;ed &s;ecuring what are Setled from the In&s;ults of the Heathen who are ready to devour them. But though it may have been &s;ome inconveniency that there have been &s;o many New Settlements of late I hope we &s;hall &s;oon find the good Effect thereof, and doubt not but that they will now feed them&s;elves and help feed us al&s;o.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t own with the Gentleman in the News-Letter, that we have been too Extravagant in our Buildings, Cloathing, Furniture, and Tables, and I confe&s;s it is a fault to exceed in the&s;e Things; But <HI>Solomon</HI> tells us, <HI>That there is nothing better under the Sun then for a Man to Eat and Drink, and Enjoy the good of his Labour:</HI> So that I believe we ought not to be &s;ordidly Covetous, and deny our &s;elves the Comfort of what we Work for, but Eat and Drink as our Circum&s;tances will afford, &s;o as not to abu&s;e the Favour of Heaven to Voluptuou&s;ne&s;s. But this wretched Trade of Half Money and Half Goods hath in&s;en&s;ibly run People into this Extravagancy, and &s;till keep 'em in it; for what &s;hall they do with their Notes to Shops, they can't Eat
<PB N="10" REF="002163_0010_0FBC791BA7116B48">
or Drink them, they mu&s;t improve 'em in &s;uch ways as I have before mentioned or utterly lo&s;e 'em: And the Country will by and by feel as great, if not greater mi&s;chiefs from this want of a Medium then we have felt, and in matters of greater Con&s;equence, for when the Bills are all in (which will not be long fir&s;t) they mu&s;t &s;ell their Produce for Shop Goods, or keep 'em and eat 'em all them&s;elves; and that we can't allow of nei|ther, for then we mu&s;t &s;tarve, and rather than do &s;o, we &s;hall be &s;o wicked as to Borrow of our Country Friends and never Pay. And if they <HI>Sell</HI> them for Goods they mu&s;t wear 'em, they can't Merchandize with 'em becau&s;e there will be no Money to Buy with: What then will be the Con&s;equences but Sloth and Idlene&s;s, they will have no U&s;e for their Wool or their Flax, their Shop Notes will be more than they will Expend. Their Children will be viciated for want of Bu&s;ine&s;s, and in another Generation will loo&s;e all that Spirit and Life which di&s;tingui&s;hes Free Men from Slaves, and will be brought to that &s;ordidne&s;s and meanne&s;s of Soul, which appears in Ireland, and &s;ome other Places, where the <HI>Poor couch like an A&s;sunder his Burthen</HI> at the &s;igh of one of there Land-Lords, though the Man (&s;et his E&s;tate a&s;ide) is no better than the meane&s;t of them And the&s;e I fear will be the mi&s;erable Con&s;equence re&s;ulting from the want of a Medium.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t joyn with the Gentleman in this that it was or the pre&s;&s;ing Importunity of the Trading part, that the General A&s;&s;embly con&s;ented to the Publick Loan or Bank and therefore I &s;uppo&s;e it was them you allude to when you talk of there being &s;hort &s;ighted. But I pre&s;ume the Gentleman will acknowledge, that the Rea&s;on of there urging that matter was becau&s;e the &s;aw they &s;hould be ruined in their Trade if they had no Medium, and the Government had cru&s;h'd the Private Bank, and therefore their Ca&s;e being almo&s;t De&s;perate they were glad to lay hold of any thing to &s;ave them&s;elves from Drowning.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="002163_0011_0FBC791E8C8BA3B0">Again that Gentleman tells us, That at a Town Meeting in <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> the Private Bank was rejected by a great Majority of the Voters; I well remember I was there but I could not &s;ee &s;uch a mighty di&s;proportion in the Votes; had it came to a written Pole, I am of Opinion they would have proved pretty equal. Put if the People did not &s;ee &s;o clearly into the Difference then, I am well &s;atisfied they have felt it &s;ince by an unhappy Experience that there Under&s;tanding was then in the dark.</P>
<P>The Gentleman goes on and &s;aith, That the Private Bank hath been Burried a great many Years; and I make no doubt but it hath &s;o been with him&s;elf and &s;ome others, and they have &s;o far Burried the Publick Bank al&s;o that both Town and Country are half ruin'd, and if a Private Bank or &s;ome other Medium be not Brought on to &s;upport us, we &s;hall ere we are aware, be plunged into the mo&s;t direful Circum&s;tances that ever poor People were in. He talks of endle&s;s mi&s;chiefs and confu&s;ions the Private Bank would have involved us in, but gives us no one In&s;tance wherein: I find they are all for General Terms when they come upon that Head and don't care to de&s;cend to Particulars.</P>
<P>The Gentleman &s;eems &s;orry for our Di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Cir|cum&s;tances, But don't project any thing for our Relief; This is only &s;aying to us, <HI>Be ye warmed and be ye cloathed</HI>; But where is the charitable <HI>Samaritan</HI> that Binds up our Wounds, and takes Compa&s;&s;ion on us. I am &s;ure I am fond of no Bank of one &s;ort or other, if any thing el&s;e can be projected which may Effectually Relieve us, but I am not for Lying down and Dying in the&s;e Circum&s;tances. We are Bare and mu&s;t be Fed, and if one Project will not do, we mu&s;t try another, and then another, as the Phy&s;ician doth with his Langui&s;hing Patient; and not neglect until Death &s;eize us and we be pa&s;t Remedy, which will &s;oon be our Ca&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="002163_0012_0FBC791FC4356098">But what could the Gentleman mean by &s;aying, That by your Projecting the Building Bridges, Fortifications, &amp;c. one would not think our Circum&s;tances &s;o di&s;tre&s;&s;ed as you pretend: Could he think any Man of common &s;en&s;e could read that part of your Letter and not charge him with triffling; is not your Propo&s;al all along to bring out a Medium of Exchange, that the Poor may be employed &amp; their Families kept from &s;tarving, which they mu&s;t do if there be not &s;ome Medium to Buy Ne|ce&s;&s;aries withal. I am as unea&s;y as others at the thoughts of Intailing a Debt on my Po&s;terity, but better be in Debt than Dye, <HI>Skin for Skin, all that a Man hath will he give for his Life:</HI> But I confe&s;s I don't &s;ee &s;uch a mighty Inconveniency neither, in leaving my Son an <HI>Hundred Pounds</HI> to pay if I leave him &s;o much the more to di&s;charge it. I acknowledge it is ju&s;t to pay our Debts, and wi&s;e and prudent to pay the Old Score, but I think it as prudent to look forward and con&s;ider how we &s;hall Live when the Bills are all in. There will not be then a Farthing of Money to Buy a mor&s;el of Bread for this great Multitude.</P>
<P>Well, the Gentleman joyns with you in Opinion in one Article, he tells you he is for incouraging Manufactures But I am &s;orry to &s;ee his mean contracted Spirit; he tells you he hopes they &s;hall Rai&s;e their own Provi&s;ions, and Wear their own Clothing, and &s;o live out of Debt, &s;o that I find he is for having the Town and Country independent of each other; for he don't pretend they &s;hall rai&s;e more than they u&s;e, &amp; as for us we may go naked and &s;tarve.</P>
<P>The Gentleman &s;aith, That the main Spring &amp; De&s;ign of your Letter was to Influence in the Choice of Repre|&s;entatives in the Country; I rather think it was to &s;et the &s;ad Condition the Town and Country is in for want of a Medium of Exchange, in a true Light, and the Poverty, Mi&s;ery and Oppre&s;&s;ion which is breaking in
<PB N="13" REF="002163_0013_0FBC79230FDBA1A0">
upon us; and indeed the Country groans under it almo&s;t as much as the Town, and &s;ay they can't improve their Lands for want of Labourers, and they can neither Buy nor Hire, becau&s;e they can't get Money; whereas if Money were plenty they could improve much more of their Lands, &amp; con&s;equently rai&s;e abundantly more, and their Lands would grow more valuable, and &s;o could afford to Sell cheaper to the Merchants, and yet be gainers by the Bargain; but for want of this Medium we can expect no other but that &s;hortly their Fields will be as the Field of the Sluggard overgrown with Tares.</P>
<P>The Gentleman tells you the Governour and Council will give you no Thanks for your Sugar Plumbs, as he is pleas'd to call them. I hope and believe you were Sincere in your Prote&s;tations, I never knew you were any Party Man; and I wi&s;h from my heart that &s;ome Method may be found for our relief to prevent Party-making among&s;t us; it grieves me to &s;ee our Divi&s;ions which are daily increa&s;ing, and which tend only to our ruin; whereas if we would but Unite, and bare with one another in our different Apprehen&s;ion of Things, debate Matters fairly, and lay a&s;ide all private de&s;igns, and Animo&s;ities, and believe that every Man's particular Intere&s;t is comprized in the General, and &s;tudy &s;incerely the Publick Good, I am fully per&s;waded we might contrive ways to Extricate our &s;elves out of the&s;e Difficulties, and be as flouri&s;hing a People as ever.</P>
<P>I hope with your Country Friends, that the &s;everal Towns will chu&s;e to Repre&s;ent 'em in the General Court, Men of a Publick Spirit; and farther I hope when they come together, that they will choo&s;e &s;uch, and none but &s;uch, for Coun&s;ellours, Men not only of Parts and Probity, but of Integrity

and down right Hone&s;ty; Lovers of King GEORGE, and of their Country al&s;o; &s;uch as will &s;incerely &s;eek our Peace and Pro&s;pe|rity: and I hope that the GOVERNOUR will of His Great Goodne&s;s to the People, con|&s;ider our Malancholy Circum&s;tances as &s;et forth in your Letter, which I have not as yet heard any Man deny the Truth of; and which he can't but be confirmed in the belief of, on peru&s;ing your Letter and the triffling An&s;werers, who have not in the lea&s;t confuted the Matters of Fact therein contained. And I pray GOD to direct the Governour and General Court in &s;ome proper Mea&s;ures for our Relief; for mo&s;t certainly &s;omething mu&s;t be done or the Place will &s;oon &s;ink and the Trade come to nothing.</P>
<P>On the whole, I perceive all the Gentle|man drives at in his pretended An&s;wer is only to draw in the few Bills which are yet abroad; he tells us this is the way to rai&s;e the value of 'em, &s;o then I find he and you agree in that point, for you &s;ay in your Let|ter that the rea&s;on &s;ome give why tho&s;e who Explode what others Project for our Relief is that they may get their Neighbours Lands at half Value, and the Gentleman I find is for drawing in all the Bills that then a Man who hath Mortgaged an Hou&s;e for <HI>Two Hun|dred Pounds</HI> which co&s;t him a <HI>Thou&s;and,</HI> mu&s;t
