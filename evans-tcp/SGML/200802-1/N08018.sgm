<P>AN acquaintance with the hi&s;tory of pa&s;t ages will lead us to ob&s;erve, that a common method of the ex|altation of a people, hath been by a <HI>&s;ucce&s;&s;ion</HI> of men of eminent abilities and influence. A great genius appears at their head, and forms a general &s;cheme of in&s;titutions and laws. This being adopted, active &s;pirits follow, who carry it into execution, and the community &s;wiftly a&s;cends to the height of pro&s;perity.</P>

EVEN <HI>I&s;rael</HI> taken under the peculiar tu|telage of Jehovah thus aro&s;e to a flouri&s;h|ing &s;tate. <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> by divine direction, gave them the rudiments of civil and eccle&s;ia&s;ti|cal polity.<HI>Jo&s;hua,</HI> by the &s;ame influence, led them over Jordan, and fixed them in the de&s;tin'd inheritance.</P>
<P>IN a way &s;omewhat &s;imilar may we well &s;uppo&s;e a people emerging from the depths of di&s;tre&s;s to regain their national character. Patriots, perhaps of different qualities, exert them&s;elves in turn, agreable to their cir|cum&s;tances, 'till they make a re&s;pectable fi|gure as in the former period of their exi&s;|tence.</P>
<P>An illu&s;tration of this we have in the ca&s;e of Judah re&s;tored to Pale&s;tine and the rights and privileges of their fathers, after their re|&s;idence in a &s;trange land, and &s;ubjection to a foreign yoke, for &s;eventy years.</P>
<P>DURING &s;o long a term, when the pub|lic offices of religion could not be regularly performed, when they were conver&s;ant with the &s;uper&s;titions of Gentili&s;m, and the man|ners of ma&s;ters upon whom they were en|tirely

dependant, it is &s;carce po&s;&s;ible but that the knowledge of divine truth mu&s;t be greatly lo&s;t, the ardor of devotion cool'd with many, their &s;pirits broken, and a ge|nerous public temper well nigh extingui&s;h|ed.</P>
<P>LET us view the&s;e exiles going to a de|&s;olate country, and a capital in ruins, with intention to po&s;&s;e&s;s and improve their anci|ent patrimony, rebuild their city, &s;et up the wor&s;hip of God upon the Hebrew ritual, and &s;ettle the civil admini&s;tration to advan|tage; at the &s;ame time de&s;pis'd and hated by their neighbours, and retarded as much as po&s;&s;ible in every &s;alutary projection.</P>
<P>THESE things con&s;idered, nothing can be clearer than the va&s;t importance that they &s;hould have <HI>wi&s;e men</HI> for <HI>pilots</HI> to direct them, men of goodne&s;s and intrepidity, to animate them to every arduous undertaking.</P>
<P>ACCORDINGLY a gracious God not only favored them with his prophets to in|&s;truct and &s;upport them, but rulers to lead and protect them, and forward the enter|pri&s;es to which they were called&mdash;fir&s;t

His countenance be|trayed a troubled &s;oul to his ma&s;ter, who under&s;tanding the cau&s;e, gave him liberty of ab&s;ence for a term, inve&s;ted him with a public character in Judea, and &s;ent manda|tory letters to his officers bordering there|upon to a&s;&s;i&s;t him.</P>

His arrival to Jeru&s;alem was like the light of the morning which di&s;&s;ipates the incumbent gloom, and invigorates nature. Every heart was revived, every hand em|ployed. Pre&s;ent with them the walls went up, and the city filled with inhabitants. By his ince&s;&s;ant care and labours grievances were redre&s;&s;ed, and all things regulated in &s;uch a manner as to render them ea&s;y and happy.</P>
<P>THIS is the <HI>lover of his nation,</HI> who&s;e words I have read. <HI>Think upon me, my God, for good, according to all that I have done for this people.</HI></P>
<P>LANGUAGE this con&s;onant to the prin|ciples of rea&s;on and revelation. Natural re|ligion dictates that God is good, and a lover of righteou&s;ne&s;s. The &s;acrifical &s;ervices of the temple as in&s;tituted for particular ca&s;es, or pointing to the promi&s;ed Saviour, while they imply'd guilt, gave a&s;&s;urance that it was con&s;i&s;tent with the rectoral ho|line&s;s of God to have re&s;pect to imperfect virtue. Nothing therefore is here expre&s;&s;ed but what is agreable to a ju&s;tne&s;s of tho't, to a due humility of mind.</P>

<P>WE are in the fir&s;t place to take notice of the ground of this reque&s;t to God.&mdash;<HI>According to all that I have done for this people.</HI></P>
<P>THIS naturally leads us into &s;ome reflec|tions upon civil government, it's de&s;ign, and the proper &s;teps whereby it is pur&s;ued. But the &s;ubjects have been handled with &s;o much copiou&s;ne&s;s and accuracy in this de&s;k, that they mu&s;t be but tran&s;iently touch'd upon.</P>
<P>IT hath plea&s;ed the creator of all things to implant in mankind a de&s;ire of happine&s;s in the continuance of being, and acce&s;&s;ions to their enjoyments. This may be deem'd a kind of in&s;tinct, which urges them with|out
<PB N="11" REF="010235_0010_0F7E0A8EF8DFB140">
any rational arguments to ward off an injury, or take hold of an offered advantage; and is an engine of providence, whereby they are impelled to action, and the human &s;pecies is pre&s;erved. To this the Father of &s;pirits hath &s;uper-added rea&s;on, to direct it in it's operations into a track con&s;i&s;tent with the welfare of others, and mo&s;t adapted to a proper end.</P>
<P>IN the pre&s;ent &s;tate this principle gaining an undue a&s;cendancy over the intelligent powers is apt to excite men to the impetu|ous pur&s;uit of per&s;onal intere&s;t, to the op|pre&s;&s;ion of the weaker. The proportion of an attainable good is moreover as the means of arriving to it. Many can effect more than one.</P>
<P>CONSIDERING then the incapacity of individuals to defend them&s;elves from the rapacious, or to reach that degree of good they might in a collective view, they are led to union. Union for the&s;e ends &s;uppo|&s;es rules framed in &s;ub&s;erviency to them. Occa&s;ions are continually ri&s;ing for the a|mendment of general rules, or additions to them, and particular ca&s;es occur which it
<PB N="12" REF="010235_0011_0F7E0A8FB1C58FD8">
is not po&s;&s;ible at once to provide for. So a &s;tanding legi&s;lature is erected. Laws with|out execution are as none, therefore there mu&s;t be an authority to &s;ee them take effect. This &s;eems the natural cour&s;e of things.</P>
<P>THE exterior &s;trength of a community, it's internal &s;afety and advantage, pre&s;ent nece&s;&s;ity, or &s;ecurity for time to come, and a variety of adventitious circum&s;tances, have their weight in the model of govern|ment, and therefore it differs according to the light in which either is viewed.</P>
<P>SURROUNDED by formidable adver&s;aries, a people may chu&s;e to give to &s;ome one a kind of dictatorial authority for their de|fence. <HI>I&s;rael</HI> vexed with the frequent ir|ruptions of their neighbours de&s;ired a king to judge them, and <HI>fight their battles.</HI> Pro|perty gives influence, and founds a &s;ort of claim to rule, and a large intere&s;t connect|ed with that of the public &s;eems to render the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or worthy of confidence. There|fore hath the &s;ole dominion been committed to a certain number. Equality of proper|ty, a quiet &s;ituation, or perhaps painful experience of the ill effects of unlimited &s;o|vereignty,
<PB N="13" REF="010235_0012_0F7E0A912A303778">
have introduced a popular juri&s;|diction, the &s;ociety at large re&s;erving to them&s;elves the final determination of mat|ters which concern them.</P>
<P>HOWEVER each of the&s;e may an&s;wer good purpo&s;es for a term, yet &s;ingly they are liable to exception. The &s;upreme legi&s;lative and executive power lodged en|tirely in the &s;ame hands uncontrouled, tends to tyranny. A government altogether po|pular by rea&s;on of an infinite diver&s;ity of particular intere&s;ts, di&s;&s;onant opinions, and formal con&s;ultations of the whole body, is &s;low, uneven, and liable to convul&s;ions, and &s;ubver&s;ion.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heineccius Sy&s;tem of Univer&s;al Law.</NOTE></P>
<P>HAPPY are tho&s;e who&s;e political plan al|lows &s;uch prerogative as is &s;ufficient to the vigor, uniformity, and di&s;patch, of public mea&s;ures, but at the &s;ame time with &s;uch re&s;trictions, as that the liberties of the &s;ub|ject are &s;afe, and by a wi&s;e mixture of the &s;everal powers which alone become pernici|ous, renders them highly beneficial.</P>
<P>GOVERNMENT originating from the law of &s;elf pre&s;ervation properly directed, and
<PB N="14" REF="010235_0013_0F7E0A9131B49FE8">
being the ba&s;is of public happine&s;s, we may ea&s;ily collect the methods to be pro&s;ecuted in con&s;equence.</P>
<P>FROM hence 'tis evident that the <HI>con&s;ti|tution</HI> claims the fir&s;t attention of &s;uch as are in the legi&s;lative capacity.</P>
<P>THROUGH the weakne&s;s of human un|der&s;tanding, fundamental principles may po&s;&s;ibly be productive of ill con&s;equences. Through a corrupt bias fal&s;e deductions may be made from maxims true and excel|lent, which practi&s;ed upon will be highly detrimental. It &s;hould therefore be their care within their line to correct mi&s;takes of either kind; <HI>for if the foundations are out of cour&s;e what &s;hall the righteous do?</HI></P>
<P>AN equitable con&s;titution on the other hand, the &s;ub&s;erviency of which to general utility experience demon&s;trates, is to be &s;trenuou&s;ly maintained. The ballance of power in a mixed government is no empty theory. The de&s;truction of it is terrible. The revolutions of Rome in former days we need not recur to in proof of this. Bri|ti&s;h records will inform us of the abolition

of the ancient &s;y&s;tem, the calamities thence en&s;uing, &s;o &s;everely felt as to induce a re|turn to it with as much zeal as it was rejec|ted. It lays with rulers to pre&s;erve this bal|lance, (every inclination of which is in a double proportion) by a &s;crupulous adhe|rence to the duties of their department, and the &s;ea&s;onable check to the violation of pre|&s;cribed limits.</P>
<P>IT is likewi&s;e evident that the <HI>whole</HI> com|munity &s;hould fall under the equal eye of rulers&mdash;that their concern &s;hould be exerci|&s;ed for <HI>all.</HI> Rival&s;hip there often may be between the &s;everal parts of &s;ociety, and &s;truggles for immunities and privileges. Con&s;tituents may expect that tho&s;e whom they elect prove their advocates in prejudice to others. But &s;uch <HI>particular</HI> re&s;pect is a perver&s;ion of the great intention of go|vernment, oftentimes rendering the condi|tion of <HI>&s;ome,</HI> of <HI>many,</HI> wor&s;e than if they had remained in a &s;tate of nature, by tying them down under public &s;anction to what in that &s;tate they might have pro&s;pect of relief from. Nece&s;&s;ary burdens are to be adju&s;ted to the different capacities of bear|ing them, and advantages to be alike open to every one properly qualified to improve them.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="010235_0015_0F7E0A956A8AEE20">
IT is equally evident that what concerns the <HI>welfare of the &s;tate</HI> is a proper object of human <HI>laws.</HI> Provi&s;ion therefore is to be made for the &s;upport of tho&s;e who &s;erve the public agreable to the places they &s;u&s;|tain&mdash;for defence from, and oppo&s;ition to, the unwarrantable encroachments of ene|mies&mdash;for the determination of conte&s;ted rights, nece&s;&s;ary to peace and order&mdash;for the encouragement of agriculture, manufactures and commerce, from whence are derived wealth and plenty&mdash;for the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of immorality, in its native tendency as well as by the righteous providence of God preg|nant with ruin&mdash;for maintaining &s;ocial wor|&s;hip, &s;o friendly to that impre&s;&s;ive &s;en&s;e of divine things whereby the &s;olemnity of an oath (the grand in&s;trument of government) is kept up, and adds to the force of civil authority that of con&s;cience&mdash;for promo|ting the intere&s;ts of learning, which &s;oftens a natural ferocity, a&s;&s;i&s;ts in the arts and bu|&s;ine&s;s of common life, capacitates for great undertakings, and with which (notwith|&s;tanding the exclamations of ignorance, en|thu&s;ia&s;m, or a narrow &s;pirit,) religion and liberty are clo&s;ely united.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="010235_0016_0F7E0A96767A4DE8">
To the efficacy of authoritative decrees to the&s;e purpo&s;es 'tis nece&s;&s;ary that they be dictated with as much preci&s;ion as po&s;&s;ible, &s;o as to be ea&s;y of application&mdash;that the re|wards and puni&s;hments annexed &s;hould be &s;uited to the circum&s;tances and prevailing pa&s;&s;ions of tho&s;e for whom they are framed, and a freedom of acce&s;s be ever pre&s;erved to the tribunals of ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>HENCE finally the true u&s;e of <HI>executive</HI> power is readily perceived. It is the ener|gy and influence of the <HI>legi&s;lative</HI>&mdash;the le|gi&s;lative put forth into act. Tho&s;e there|fore who are ve&s;ted with it are never at li|berty to di&s;pen&s;e with laws&mdash;are ever to make them their rule of conduct, and to their utmo&s;t, endeavour a concurrence with the &s;pirit and de&s;ign of them.</P>
<P>WITH this general idea of civil govern|ment coincides the word of in&s;piration, when it a&s;&s;ures us that the ruler is the <HI>mini&s;ter of God for good&mdash;a revenger</HI> to <HI>execute wrath up|on him</HI> that <HI>doeth</HI> evil, <HI>attending continually up|on this very thing.</HI> With this coincide the common &s;entiments of antiquity. <HI>The kings of the Gentiles</HI> (&s;ome of the &s;ucce&s;&s;ors of

Alexander particularly) cho&s;e to be called <HI>benefactors,</HI> when they rever&s;ed the charac|ter. Pagan deities were at fir&s;t earthly he|roes&mdash;good rulers who laid them&s;elves out for the benefit of mankind. Whether they had an <HI>apotheo&s;is</HI> in <HI>gratitude</HI> for what they did here, or as <HI>be&s;t qualified</HI> to &s;uperintend affairs below, or as an <HI>incentive</HI> with their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors to <HI>an imitation,</HI> it &s;hows the &s;en&s;e of mankind upon this head.</P>
<P>II. THE other thing which comes under con&s;ideration is the reque&s;t to God. <HI>Think upon me my God for good.</HI></P>
<P>THIS in connection with the latter clau&s;e is worthy of di&s;tinct remark, as containing &s;ea&s;onable and weighty hints, viewed in a diver&s;ity of lights.</P>
<P N="1">1. WE may under&s;tand it as an implica|tion of a ruler's governing aim at the appro|bation of Heaven in his admini&s;tration.</P>
<P>THE favourable regards of God cannot be conceiv'd to be extended to any who&s;e habitual conver&s;ation in the world he di&s;|likes, and therefore cannot fitly be applied
<PB N="19" REF="010235_0018_0F7E0A97F7D54DF0">
for by tho&s;e who have not made it their main care to plea&s;e him. Such a &s;anctifica|tion of God in the heart by the influence of his &s;pirit and truths as &s;hall give the &s;u|premacy to his approbation, is of va&s;t con|&s;equence to rulers, having a prodigious ef|ficacy with them in the &s;pecial bu&s;ine&s;s to which they are called.</P>
<P>PERFECT wi&s;dom hath made nothing without de&s;ign. The faculties of the minds of men are for improvement, the talents given them for u&s;e in &s;ome particular &s;phere. The di&s;po&s;al of circum&s;tances, and adapted|ne&s;s of talents thereto, point out this &s;phere. Hereby indu&s;try is recommended in every &s;tation, and the command proclaimed as with an audible voice from heaven, <HI>Occupy 'till I come.</HI></P>
<P>WITHOUT &s;ubjection to the will of God the ruler cannot enjoy his &s;miles. Seriou&s;ly and deeply affected herewith, he gives all diligence (never content merely with the honors and emoluments of a place) that his mind may be furni&s;hed for exalted &s;ervice. He will therefore carefully examine the be&s;t policy of &s;tates, the cau&s;es of their gran|deur

and declen&s;ion, attentively &s;urvey his own country, it's &s;ituation, connexions, and manners, inve&s;tigate the foundation of laws, and their true &s;en&s;e, by inten&s;e thought, and the &s;tudy of the mo&s;t judi|cious writers upon the &s;ubject, and conver&s;e with the remoter branches of knowledge (according to opportunity) which throw light upon what he is more nearly con|cerned with. He ri&s;es early, and &s;its up late, deliberating upon the public &s;afety. Contemplation and reading are for active duties, and the trea&s;ures of wi&s;dom labo|riou&s;ly acquired are freely expended for the good of &s;ociety. The &s;enate complains not of his ab&s;ence, or the &s;eat of judgment. He propo&s;es, &s;upports, objects, determines, and executes, and &s;trains every nerve in the fulfillment of his tru&s;t.</P>
<P>UNDER a firm per&s;wa&s;ion that the <HI>righ|teous Lord loveth righteou&s;ne&s;s, de&s;ireth truth</HI> in <HI>the inward parts,</HI> and that <HI>in his favor</HI> is <HI>life,</HI> he engages in every momentous tran&s;|action with &s;olemnity of &s;pirit, is exceeding cautious that he does not pervert judgment nor con&s;ent to any thing merely for it's plau|&s;ible appearance. Whatever comes before

him pa&s;&s;es under a &s;evere &s;crutiny; a&s;&s;ent|ing hereupon to its rectitude it is received and pro&s;ecuted. He is not a wed into com|pliances di&s;agreable to the convictions of his mind by menaces from any quarter.&mdash;<HI>The fear of man bringeth a &s;nare, but who&s;o putteth his tru&s;t in the Lord,</HI> maintains due re|&s;pect to him, <HI>&s;hall be &s;afe</HI> from the prevailing power of &s;uch a temptation. Tenacious of a well formed purpo&s;e, &s;ecular arguments of no &s;ort are &s;ufficient to warp him, he pur&s;ues it with an inflexible &s;tability. Con|&s;tituted guardian of liberty, it is ever before him, and dear to him above any earthly enjoyment. He is ready to all ju&s;t means for it's pre&s;ervation, even to the laying down his life if called for in providence: But never will he abu&s;e the venerable name through precipitancy of pa&s;&s;ion, and for the gratification of any per&s;onal &s;ini&s;ter views.</P>
<P>INCOMPATIBLE with this per&s;wa&s;ion is an habit of intrigue and di&s;&s;imulation,&mdash;every &s;ubtle eva&s;ion of right, and tho&s;e ar|tifices which create confidence and ruin de|pendants.

THE greate&s;t may have &s;ome avenue whereby they are acce&s;&s;ible to the crafty and de&s;igning. A latent vanity not ea&s;ily &s;ubdued renders adulation too palatable. Sucking in the lu&s;cious draught, the ruler (as well as others) may be intoxicated with the poi&s;on. Not &s;o if he loves the <HI>prai&s;e of God</HI> more than of man.

<P>IT mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed that other principles be&s;ides this we have been con&s;idering may carry the ruler into a channel of duty in many in&s;tances beneficial to a people.

<P>NATURAL benevolence&mdash;a di&s;po&s;ition to &s;erve mankind and to &s;erve them grace|fully at once charms us, and we are ready to pre&s;age much good when this is the cha|racteri&s;tic of a ruler.

<P>SENSE of honor hath been much extol|led, and is not without its advantages in high life. But if all which is meant by it is a regard to decorum of behaviour as it comes under the ob&s;ervation and judgment of the world, 'tis too &s;tinted, too fluctuating always to be depended upon. This is con|&s;i&s;tent with private vices, which by a kind of fatality draw on &s;uch as are more flagrant, and widely mi&s;chievous.

2. THIS clau&s;e connected with the latter may import the ruler's con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of in|tegrity in office, and his appeal to God on behalf of it.</P>
<P>MANKIND with under&s;tanding, judg|ment, and memory, are capable of recollec|ting the pa&s;t temper and conduct, and com|paring them with &s;ome rule&mdash;the divine law. Conformity or di&s;agreement herewith begets &s;atisfaction or unea&s;ine&s;s in review, e&s;pecially as relative to the final determina|tion of the character and &s;tate by God the judge of all. What reverence is due to con&s;cience, who&s;e power is alike exerci&s;ed in ab&s;olving or condemning the <HI>great</HI> and the <HI>&s;mall?</HI> How much &s;hould we prize his friend&s;hip, how fearful left we exa&s;perate him?</P>
<P>THE ruler is not always exempt from the cen&s;ure and re&s;entment of the world. Me|lancholy beyond de&s;cription is his ca&s;e if the reproaches of con&s;cience are joined with tho&s;e of a people&mdash;when de&s;erted by man, he cannot look up to God with com|fort, for the voice of con&s;cience is the voice of God. But cen&s;ure and re&s;entment are
<PB N="26" REF="010235_0025_0F7E0A9D3ACF63B0">
not confined to tho&s;e only that are culpable. Sometimes they fall upon the upright; through mi&s;apprehen&s;ions, jealou&s;ies atten|dant upon a warm pa&s;&s;ion for liberty, heavy burdens and di&s;appointments fermenting the &s;pirit, or under &s;ome particular malevo|lent influence. Mo&s;es was <HI>faithful in all God's hou&s;e;</HI> but for an extraordinary divine interpo&s;al he would have &s;uffered from tho&s;e for whom he &s;o fervently pleaded. If <HI>I&s;|rael</HI> is deemed an exception to the re&s;t of mankind let us look el&s;ewhere. The <HI>Athe|nians</HI> were the mo&s;t polite and &s;en&s;ible peo|ple on earth; quick in di&s;cerning merit, and ready to embrace it. Yet tho&s;e for whom they ordained public honours, by rea&s;on of unfortunate events in which they had no &s;hare, felt the weight of their di&s;|plea&s;ure. Even <HI>Ari&s;tides</HI> by the &s;uperior intere&s;t of a powerful adver&s;ary, endur'd the &s;everity of <HI>O&s;traci&s;m,</HI> wi&s;hing as he re|linqui&s;hed his country that it might never want him. Now when &s;uch a di&s;a&s;trous lot befals a faithful ruler, leading him to a &s;olemn retro&s;pect, va&s;t indeed mu&s;t be his happine&s;s with the te&s;timony of con&s;cience in his favour.

<P>BUT &s;uppo&s;ing &s;uch a day as this never to happen, yet mortality is the end of all men. Rulers are &s;tiled <HI>gods</HI> as in an eleva|ted &s;tation, but they mu&s;t <HI>die like men.</HI> Ly|ing upon the bed of death that &s;erious re|flection is &s;carce avoidable which a crowd of bu&s;ine&s;s and &s;plendid &s;cenes prevented in &s;ome. How di&s;tre&s;&s;ing mu&s;t be that period, to one who for long time hath lo&s;t fight of his errand, and perverted the ends of his divine appointment, oppre&s;&s;ed with guilt peculiarly accumulated? On the contrary what tran&s;ports are at this &s;ea&s;on the por|tion of him, who hath exerci&s;ed a <HI>con&s;cience void of offence,</HI> who&s;e applau&s;e reaches to the late&s;t moments? <HI>Remember O Lord,</HI> as once a jewi&s;h monarch, &s;ays he, (as &s;uppo&s;ed upon the verge of life) <HI>how I have walked before thee in truth, and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is good in thy &s;ight,</HI> and &s;miles in the pangs of di&s;&s;olving nature.</P>
<P N="3">3. THIS clau&s;e may be under&s;tood as denoting a ruler's faith in and hope of the

<P>HOWEVER important the di&s;pute may be concerning the intimation of future hap|pine&s;s in the old te&s;tament, 'tis needle&s;s to enter upon it now. Suffice it at pre&s;ent that the Jews in fact believed, and were actuated by it.</P>
<P>ETERNAL life is the free gift of God through Je&s;us Chri&s;t our Lord, but a gift appropriated to tho&s;e who po&s;&s;e&s;s a temper devoted to his &s;ervice and glory, and be|&s;towed according to their a&s;&s;iduity in his work. Agreably our divine prophet hath repre&s;ented mankind as &s;ervants, betru&s;ted with pounds or talents&mdash;&s;omething improve|able, and di&s;tingui&s;hed as they gained by trading.</P>
<P>WHAT re&s;traint is the faith which is the <HI>&s;ub&s;tance of things hoped for,</HI> and <HI>the evidence of things not &s;een</HI> from predominant worldly ambition and avarice, prolific &s;ources of venality and corruption!

<P>WITH this faith and hope who among the &s;ons of the mighty can burn with re&s;t|le&s;s de&s;ires of mounting higher in the &s;cale of human glory, indifferent to any methods of advancement however ba&s;e or unworthy?

<P>THAT God is not unrighteous to forget the <HI>work,</HI> and <HI>labour of love &s;hewed towards his name</HI> and people, being deeply imbib'd in the heart, is a powerful impul&s;e with a ruler to un&s;haken per&s;everance in duty. <HI>By
