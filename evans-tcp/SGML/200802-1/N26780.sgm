<HEAD>THE HORRORS OF OAKENDALE ABBEY.</HEAD>
<P>IN the gloomy month of November, when the mountains in Cumberland were almo&s;t con|cealed by the heavy black clouds which hung be|low their tops, and a thick drippling rain &s;carce|ly left the few &s;cattered cottages of Oakendale di&s;cernable, the pea&s;ants were all retired to their habitations; and through this thick atmo&s;phere the &s;tately ruins of the antient Abbey appeared like a black ma&s;s of immen&s;e length, and could only be di&s;tingui&s;hed as a building, by the glim|mering twinkling of the &s;mall panes of gla&s;s from &s;ome of the many windows which were di&s;per&s;ed, without uniformity, in this gloomy &s;tructure.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="035640_0003_10069263A8603E20">
The church clock had &s;truck five, when a loud knocking at the cottage of Aaron Giles (who was intru&s;ted with the keys of the Abbey) rou&s;ed him from a &s;lumber to which the labours of the day, and the &s;tillne&s;s of the evening, had compo&s;ed him, and cau&s;ed a &s;trange alarm to the re&s;t of his family, con&s;i&s;ting of a notable Dame, now &s;eated at the &s;pinning-wheel, a beautiful girl about fourteen years of age, and two &s;tout boys, who were quietly eating a piece of brown bread.&mdash;"Lord," cried the wife and daughter, both in the &s;ame breath, "what can that be!&mdash;Don't open the door, father," &s;aid the girl, "for fear it &s;hould be one of the &s;pirits from the Abbey."</P>
<P>The repeated knocking &s;ufficiently awakened Aaron, terrified the re&s;t of the family, and a voice demanded in&s;tant admittance.</P>
<P>Aaron, half bold, and half afraid, regardle&s;s of the entreaties of tho&s;e about him, ventured to undraw the bolt, and a&s;k "Who was there?"</P>
<P>"You mu&s;t open the door," replied a quick voice, "and deliver to me the keys of the Abbey."</P>
<P>Aaron, who had by this time opened the door &s;ufficiently to di&s;tingui&s;h a &s;ervant well mounted

with a livery great coat on, entirely lo&s;t all fear and replied, "The keys of the Abbey! why, no|body would venture there at this time of night what can they be wanted for?"</P>
<P>"For a lady," replied the &s;ervant, "who will be here within two hours, and you mu&s;t go with me; and your wife mu&s;t come al&s;o, to make a fire, and get things in a little order and comfort for my Lady."</P>
<P>"Order and comfort for my Lady!" &s;aid Aaron, (holding the door fa&s;t in his hand) "I am &s;ure there is no order or comfort to be had there."</P>
<P>"No, no," &s;aid his wife, advancing fearfully; nobody don't like to go there in day-time, much more when it is dark; and ma&s;ter mu&s;t not deliver the keys to any but my Lord him&s;elf, or to Mu&s;ter Acre, the &s;teward."</P>
<P>"Prithee, give me the keys," &s;aid the &s;ervant "and keep me here no longer; for I have orders, both from my Lord and Mr. Acre, to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="4 letters">ive them; &s;o do not trifle for no time is to be lo&s;t."</P>
<P>Aaron, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> his head, know not what to do; but told the man "he had better come in a

bit; as for going to the Abbey, it was &s;ooner &s;aid than done.&mdash;Why," &s;aid he, "you do not know what you a&s;k; we might be carried away, and never heard on any more. I never ventures in there without two or three as &s;tout as my&s;elf with me, and then we be ju&s;t frightened out of our lives."</P>
<P>"Never fear," replied the footman, who had by this time di&s;mounted, and was advancing into the hou&s;e; at the &s;ame time taking a pi&s;tol from his pocket, which he held in a menacing manner, &s;aying, "What the devil are you afraid of? Why, I will engage to blow up all the gho&s;ts in the country, if you will give me a draught of &s;ome|thing to drink, for I am devili&s;h dry."</P>
<P>The good woman, tremblingly replied, "She would give him &s;ome cyder, provided he would put up the pi&s;tol, and not be bla&s;phemous; and the poor little girl, who with her brothers had fled to the further corner of the room, on &s;eeing the pi&s;tol which he &s;till held in his hand, advanc|ed, fell upon her knees, and begged him not to kill them, for none of them had done any harm.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="035640_0006_1006926DC8EDE768">
The beauty and innocence of this girl &s;oftened the valiant boa&s;tings of the footman; and he in|&s;tantly returned the pi&s;tol to his pocket, &s;aying. "No, my pretty dear, I have no intention to hurt you."</P>
<P>During this time, Aaron was reading a letter the &s;ervant had given him, which contained an order from Lord Oakendale, for his in&s;tantly pre|paring the Abbey for the reception of a Lady, who would be there on that very evening. Aaron, terrified at the idea of the undertaking, and yet &s;eeing the nece&s;&s;ity of his obedience, in&s;tantly &s;ummoned two of his neighbours, who, together with the footman and him&s;elf, prepared with lant|erns to venture into that Abbey, which, even in the day-time, none of the inhabitants ever dared to enter, and which had been the terror of many generations. Some of the rooms were habitable, and it occupied in length many hundred feet of ground. A great part of it con&s;i&s;ted of low crumbling walls, long pa&s;&s;ages, or cloi&s;ters, and it had a communication with the village church. It was likewi&s;e &s;uppo&s;ed that there were vaults and &s;ubterraneous pa&s;&s;ages under the whole build|ing. The thickne&s;s of the walls be&s;poke the anti|quity
<PB N="8" REF="035640_0007_10069272EFEB74C0">
of its date, and the &s;trength of the work|man&s;hip defied the ravages of time; indeed no per&s;on in the&s;e parts pretended to trace its origin. For the la&s;t hundred years it had de&s;cended with the Earldom of Oakendale; but was never re|membered to have been inhabited for more than a few days.</P>
<P>The tradition of the country recorded a dread|ful murder that had been perpetrated in one of the rooms, which was evidently &s;tained with blood; and various tales were handed down to po&s;terity, with additional wonders according to the prolific fancy of the relater.</P>
<P>One circum&s;tance had lately impre&s;&s;ed the minds, of the villagers with an a&s;&s;urance of its being un|der the dominion of &s;upernatural powers, which was, that of a young man (about three months before the pre&s;ent period) having arrived at the village, demanded the keys, and determined to explore the Abbey alone, and no trace or ve&s;tige having ever &s;ince been di&s;covered concerning him. The keys were found in the doors; nor was the hor&s;e he came upon ever enquired after! To this place then, and at this &s;ea&s;on, &s;allied forth the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> mentioned four men followed by <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">

Giles, with bed-clothes and other nece&s;&s;aries, In order to prepare for the expected Lady. The children followed with trembling &s;teps, equally afraid to be left at home as to proceed with their mother.</P>
<P>Upon entering the great door, which was plac|ed in a porch like that of a church, its ponder|ous weight creeked upon its ma&s;&s;y hinges, the echoes of which &s;ounded with a tremendous noi&s;e. A &s;mall narrow pa&s;&s;age led to a large hall, with high grated windows; at the four corners of which were narrow pa&s;&s;ages leading to different apartments. In the centre of the hall were two folding doors, which opened into a &s;pacious room, the top of which terminated into a dome of great height; a &s;tairca&s;e on the right led to various rooms, long galleries, narrow pa&s;&s;ages and clo&s;|ets; long ranges of building extended on each &s;ide of the part they had entered, which appear|ed to be the only habitable place in this immen&s;e pile of building; and in the&s;e the walls were &s;o damp, and even of tho&s;e that were covered, the hangings were &s;o ragged, and the whole &s;o de&s;|titute of furniture, that not the mo&s;t di&s;tant idea of comfort could be imagined for the poor Lady.
<PB N="10" REF="035640_0009_1006927ACA6919A0">
who was the expected inhabitant of this gloomy man&s;ion.</P>
<P>After having &s;wept away the cobwebs, and cleared &s;ome of the dirt, the good woman began to con&s;ider where the poor Lady was to &s;leep, for as yet they had not ventured up &s;tairs; nor did they know if there was &s;uch a thing as a bed-lodging to the Abbey. Not one of them would &s;tir a foot without the re&s;t attended; even the valiant footman would not proceed alone, altho he pretended to blu&s;ter and throw open the doors one after another, &s;wearing at, and defying all the gho&s;ts in Chri&s;tendom; whil&s;t the more timid inhabitants of the village &s;tared with fear and a&s;toni&s;hment at his temerity.</P>
<P>Beds there were, but &s;carcely in a condition to accommodate any one; and, when Dame Giles &s;urveyed the tattered velvet of the curtains, and beheld the nodding te&s;ter of immen&s;e height, &s;he derived a &s;ecret comfort from the compari&s;on be|tween this, and much in favor of her own humble chamber at the cottage.</P>
<P>Having arranged every thing in as much order as the time and place would admit, and having
<PB N="11" REF="035640_0010_1006927D886E4788">
met with nothing to alarm or terrify them, they &s;at down in expectation of the arrival of the Lady. They had not waited long before a chai&s;e and four hor&s;es (with &s;ome difficulty, on account of the weeds and briars which impeded their way to the porch) drew up. When the chai&s;e door was opened by the footman a very beautiful young Lady appeared, eager to jump out. She was followed by another, who &s;eemed older, and, as an attendant, every way inferior to the Lady her&s;elf; the attractions of who&s;e per&s;on at once in&s;pired the hearts of the beholders with equal wonder, pity and a&s;toni&s;hment, that &s;o charming a young creature &s;hould be con&s;igned to &s;o dreary and wretched a &s;olitude.</P>
<P>If they were lo&s;t in wonder and &s;urpri&s;e at her beauty, how infinitely more was their admiration excited when, in the mo&s;t melodious accents and engaging manner, &s;he addre&s;&s;ed the woman and the gazing pea&s;ants, by a&s;king them "If they re|&s;ided there, and if they could a&s;&s;ure her there were no other per&s;ons in the Abbey?</P>
<P>"Lack-a-day!" &s;aid Dame Giles, "we be none on us to &s;tay here; we only comed to make a fire, and get a little ready for your Lady&s;hip
<PB N="12" REF="035640_0011_10069282CDEF8140">
and I'm <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> as how you'll find it very lone|&s;ome being in this di&s;mal place by your&s;elves."</P>
<P>"Not at all," returned the Lady, "provided I am unmole&s;ted."</P>
<P>Dame Giles looked grave, and thought within her&s;elf that was not certain; but &s;he would not &s;ay any thing that might occa&s;ion fears of evil &s;pirits to this young Lady, who &s;eemed entirely free from any &s;uch apprehen&s;ions, and for whom &s;he conceived the highe&s;t veneration, mixed with the tendere&s;t pity, for being de&s;tined to an abode in her opinion, &s;o dangerous.</P>
<P>When &s;he attended her to the apartment where the bed was, and apologized for the coar&s;e|ne&s;s of the &s;heets and bed clothes, which had been furni&s;hed from her cottage, the Lady gave a look of &s;urpri&s;e at the antiquity of the bed, and the gloomy magnificence of the room, which was large, with an immen&s;e fire-place; a long gothic window on the right, on the &s;mall pains of which were painted &s;erpents, dragons, and &s;uch unmeaning and hideous mon&s;ters; a &s;maller window was placed in a corner on the left, and the ragged tape&s;try repre&s;ented &s;till more horri|ble figures, all of which waved in life-like move|ments
<PB N="13" REF="035640_0012_100692848D23C500">
as the air (admitted by the door) fanned the loo&s;e hanging on which they were repre&s;ent|ed.&mdash;She &s;urveyed in &s;ilence the di&s;mal appear|ance of the whole; and then &s;aid (with a &s;igh) "I &s;hall find no fault I believe; but &s;hall proba|bly &s;leep quieter than I have done for many nights pa&s;t, in plea&s;anter rooms, and beds that &s;eemed better calculated for repo&s;e."</P>
<P>The per&s;on who had come with her &s;eemed to &s;urvey every thing with a countenance of horror, and an expre&s;&s;ion of fear; and, turning to the young Lady, &s;aid, "My dear Madam, is it po&s;|&s;ible that we can &s;tay in this melancholy place alone? Why, I never &s;aw any thing half &s;o di&s;|mal; I &s;hall not, I am &s;ure, clo&s;e my eyes in that frightful bed. Cannot you," addre&s;&s;ing Dame Giles, "&s;tay with us to night?"</P>
<P>"No," replied the other; "I cannot, at the &s;ame time thinking &s;he would not, for all the world."</P>
<P>The young Lady, who&s;e name was Laura, &s;aid to her companion, "Why, &s;urely you are not afraid of gho&s;ts! and at pre&s;ent: I &s;ee nothing el&s;e to fear here; but, addre&s;&s;ing her&s;elf to the

daughter of Dame Giles, who was clo&s;e to her mother, &s;he &s;aid, "Perhaps you will &s;tay with us, my little maid; and when there are three of us we cannot be afraid."</P>
<P>"No," &s;aid Peggy, "I wo nut &s;tay."</P>
<P>"Well, as you plea&s;e," &s;aid Laura; "and as I am much fatigued, I will not detain you any longer."</P>
<P>Dame Giles repleni&s;hed the fire, left them a &s;ufficient number of lights, and departed, pro|mi&s;ing to come there early in the morning to pre|pare their breakfa&s;ts. Meantime the footman had been giving orders to Aaron to go to the next market town, and provide them with every nece&s;|&s;ary for their accommodation. He then deliver|ed a letter into the hands of Laura, and then re&s;|pectfully withdrew. He returned to the cottage with Aaron, and the other two men; where, mounting his hor&s;e, he rode away. The cotta|gers &s;pent &s;ome time wondering at the &s;trangene&s;s of the adventure, and expre&s;&s;ing their fears, le&s;t the Ladies might be carried away by the evil &s;pi|rits which were &s;aid to haunt the Abbey.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="035640_0014_10068EF6FB422698">
Having left Laura and her companion in the Abbey, and the inhabitants of Oakendale quietly taking their repo&s;e, it may be nece&s;&s;ary to give the reader &s;ome account of the family to whom the Abbey belonged, and how Laura came to be its pre&s;ent inhabitant.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent Lord Oakendale had &s;ucceeded in a lenial de&s;cent to the Earldom and e&s;tates of Oak|endale. His great-grandfather was the only one that the olde&s;t inhabitant of the village could re|member, and that memory was impre&s;&s;ed by wicked and atrocious deeds, &s;aid to have been committed by this old Earl, &s;ince which time it had never been inhabited more than for a few days, when the pre&s;ent Lord's father brought down a beautiful woman, who was his wife, and mother to the pre&s;ent Earl; her picture was &s;aid to be &s;till in one of the rooms.</P>
<P>It was currently reported, that various figures had been &s;een flitting about after twilight; gha&s;t|ly vi&s;ions had appeared, &s;meared with blood; and the gho&s;t of a lady, who was &s;uppo&s;ed to have been murdered in one of the rooms, was u&s;ually &s;een after it was dark looking through the win|dows, with &s;treams of blood running from her
<PB N="16" REF="035640_0015_1006928AA198E038">
throat. Tales of this nature had filled the minds of the &s;imple villagers with dreadful apprehen|&s;ions; but what had given more rea&s;onable colour and &s;trength to the&s;e fears were, two circum&s;tan|ces, which had happened within only a twelve-month of each other; one was, that of a young gentleman's never being heard of after going to explore the Abbey; the other, of another gentle|man's endeavoring to &s;leep there, who was &s;o extremely terrified by noi&s;es, howlings and phan|toms, that, although a determined and re&s;olute man, he was obliged to relinqui&s;h the de&s;ign, and to pa&s;s the remainder of the night with one of the villagers in a cottage.</P>
<P>Lord Oakendale, the pre&s;ent Earl, had never &s;een the Abbey; he had no doubt heard the re|ports, but, being a very di&s;&s;ipated man, he gave no heed to them, much le&s;s had any de&s;ire to have them inve&s;tigated. He was the elde&s;t of two brothers, who were the only &s;urviving &s;ons of a numerous progeny. Their di&s;po&s;itions, manners, per&s;ons and &s;entiments, were, from their earlie&s;t childhood, &s;o totally oppo&s;ite, that not the mo&s;t di&s;tant &s;imilarity could ever be di&s;covered. Rob|ert, the elder, who was the pre&s;ent Earl, was
<PB N="17" REF="035640_0016_1006928FEC0BE100">
haughty, imperious, vindictive, vain and artful, and, if any &s;pring of latent virtue aro&s;e in his heart, it was &s;uppre&s;&s;ed and overpowered by the&s;e vices. His per&s;on was far &s;uperior to his mind; for there, indeed, the graces &s;hone forth with con&s;picuous lu&s;tre. He was tall, well proportion|ed, and of a bold and manly countenance. His brother William, though le&s;s in &s;tature, was equal|ly well made, and had the mo&s;t engaging and at|tractive features. An expre&s;&s;ive countenance di&s;|played a mind fraught with every manly virtue that could adorn a chri&s;tian and a &s;oldier. At a very early age he entered the army, and di&s;tin|gui&s;hed him&s;elf in the &s;ervice of his country by more than one noble and gallant action; during which time his brother was leading a life, not only of inactivity, but of unlimited debauchery of every kind. Two years after the death of the late Earl, he found him&s;elf &s;o embarra&s;&s;ed and his fortune &s;o little equal to his expences, that he was under the nece&s;&s;ity of repairing it by a mar|riage, in which love formed no part of the con|tract.</P>

She followed her inclinations entirely; and, as they entertain|ed a mutual indifference for each other, contempt and aver&s;ion &s;oon followed.</P>
<P>Meantime William returned from the field of battle crowned with laurels and univer&s;al e&s;teem. His many virtues called forth the envy and hatred of his brother, who could by no means bear to &s;ee him&s;elf &s;o far eclip&s;ed; and as this jealou&s;y rankled in his heart, under the &s;pecious cover of love and regard he continued to undermine his advancement, and prevent his gaining that rank to which his merits &s;o ju&s;tly entitled him.&mdash;Un&s;u&s;|picious, and judging of every heart by his own, William could not &s;ee through the hypocri&s;y of Lord Oakendale; and with a contented mind he pa|tiently waited the di&s;pen&s;ations of fortune. Thus

looking forward with hope, with tender adieus to his brother, to whom he looked as his only relation and be&s;t friend, he embarked with his regiment for the Ea&s;t Indies. In the mean time Lord Oakendale continued his di&s;&s;ipated life, and, having no children, he had formed no ce|ment of conjugal felicity. He had met with Lau|ra in a very ob&s;cure part of South Wales, where he had been bathing the preceding autumn. He was wonderfully &s;truck with her beauty, and al|together plea&s;ed with her manners. From the fir&s;t moment he beheld her, he was determined to po&s;&s;e&s;s her per&s;on; and finding, upon acquaint|ance, that an uncommon, delicacy and virtuous principle governed all her actions, he carefully concealed from her that he was a married man till he had learned her &s;ituation, and had, as he thought, made an intere&s;t in her affections, and &s;ecured every bar which might oppo&s;e his happi|ne&s;s. But, as her hi&s;tory will make a principle part of this work, we &s;hall only at pre&s;ent inform our readers, that he had &s;ent her to this di&s;mal abode, under the idea that the horrors of the place, and the ob&s;curity of the village, would &s;ooner di&s;po&s;e a mind, like hers, to coincide with his wi&s;hes, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span">.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="035640_0019_10069298B5D40F50">
The letter the footman had left with her was from his Lord&s;hip, containing an apology for his having con&s;igned her to &s;o melancholy and rude a &s;ituation; a&s;&s;uring her that he &s;hould not intrude upon her retirement without her permi&s;&s;ion, and concluding with his unalterable love and re&s;pect.</P>
<P>After Dame Giles and the other villagers had left Laura and &s;he heard the gate of the Abbey locked upon her, a &s;ound which terrified her more fearful companion, &s;he opened and peru&s;ed Lord Oakendale's letter, which having carele&s;sly read, and gathering &s;atisfaction from his pro|mi&s;e of not coming there, &s;he propo&s;ed going to bed, with the idea of enjoying a better night's re&s;t than &s;he had experienced for many of the pa&s;t: but her companion wi&s;hed to &s;it up, being, as &s;he declared, afraid to con&s;ign her&s;elf to &s;leep in &s;o di&s;mal a room, and &s;till more di&s;mal looking bed. Laura, who entertained no fears of this na|ture, determined to undre&s;s her&s;elf, and &s;eek that repo&s;e of which &s;he &s;tood in need; and Mary, her companion, being equally afraid to &s;it up, if Laura &s;hould go to &s;leep; therefore, however re|luctantly, prepared to do the &s;ame.

of fear, &s;oon fell into a profound &s;leep; but Ma|ry, without ever having heard any tales concern|ing the Abbey gave way to the fancies &s;he form|ed from its appearance; and a thou&s;and appre|hen&s;ions, of &s;he knew not what, made her afraid to open her eyes, or to &s;hut them, and by that means de&s;troyed every idea of re&s;t. She &s;everal times attempted to awake Laura, but found it impo&s;&s;ible; &s;he was therefore obliged to attend to the various noi&s;es which a&s;&s;ailed her ear, without being able either to communicate her fears, or receive any comfort from her companion. The account &s;he gave in the morning, was, that &s;oon after &s;he had been in bed, &s;he plainly heard the &s;ound of doors opening and &s;hutting, and upon li&s;tening more attentively, &s;he heard voices whi&s;|pering, and foot&s;teps at, or very near, the cham|ber door. All the&s;e relations, when repeated in the morning to Laura, &s;he treated as idle chimeras of a fearful apprehen&s;ion; declaring &s;he had never in her life &s;lept better, and that it was her fixed re&s;olution to explore every part of the Abbey be|fore the en&s;uing night.</P>
<P>Dame Giles, attended by her daughter, arriv|ed at the Abbey with their breakfa&s;ts; and
<PB N="22" REF="035640_0021_100692A1C316B5E0">
plea&s;ed at finding them &s;afe where &s;he had left them, began making the fire, and moving about with more alacrity than &s;he had done the preced|ing night; but gave little or no an&s;wer to the in|terrogatories of Mary concerning the Abbey, and who or what beings be&s;ides them&s;elves were &s;up|po&s;ed to be the inhabitants of it.</P>
<P>Dame Giles &s;aid, "She knew of nobody being in it but them&s;elves;" and, not willing to in|crea&s;e her fears, added, "That the pa&s;&s;ages were long and narrow, and the wind might whi&s;tle and draw through them like voices."</P>
<P>Laura, who&s;e beautiful countenance, refre&s;hed by &s;leep was animated with uncommon lu&s;tre, laughed at their conver&s;ation; again declaring her intention of taking a &s;urvey of the Abbey, as well as walking round the hills which &s;eemed to &s;ur|round it; the beauty of which &s;he admired as &s;he viewed them through the &s;mall ca&s;ements of the windows.</P>
<P>The &s;un &s;hone upon the tops of the hills, and its &s;ilver rays, which reflected upon the fro&s;ty turf with a dazzling whitene&s;s, gave it a cheerful appearance.&mdash;"Tell me not, &s;aid &s;he, of voices

and noi&s;es, here is nothing to create fear; hark, how the robin twitters his gentle note; and &s;ee how the fro&s;t glitters upon the verdure! The winds only be&s;peak the wintry &s;ea&s;on, but noth|ing to in&s;pire notions either of fear or dread. Ah! would fortune but &s;mile upon me with the &s;ame benign a&s;pect that the face of nature does, how little I &s;hould have to regret; and how well &s;hould I be plea&s;ed to remain all my days in this &s;eque&s;tered retirement? But, alas! no &s;uch hap|pine&s;s awaits me&mdash;a poor unprotected orphan, without a claim upon any human being, nothing but my own courage and virtue to guard me from the power of a villain! Ah me! my own reflec|tions are the bittere&s;t accompaniments of my &s;ol|itude." During this &s;oliloquy, which bur&s;t in|voluntarily from the oppre&s;&s;ed heart of Laura, her two companions &s;tood in mute attention, the one knowing or partly gue&s;&s;ing, that &s;he had ju&s;t rea&s;on for her complaints, and the other &s;taring at her without well under&s;tanding the meaning of her &s;peech; which, being uttered in a pathetic voice, and in &s;entiments rather above her com|prehen&s;ion, induced her to entertain the idea of her being mad, and brought there for confine|ment;

but when Laura turned her lovely face to|wards them, and the pearly tears cha&s;ed each o|ther down the faire&s;t cheeks that nature ever formed, whil&s;t her expre&s;&s;ive eyes &s;eemed to a&s;k for pity's &s;oothing voice, the gentler pa&s;&s;ions &s;tole upon the heart of Dame Giles; &s;he felt the mo&s;t tender pity for the fair object before her, and, in a melting &s;train, &s;he replied, "God help you, my poor young lady; &s;ure no body would go to hurt &s;o &s;weet a creature!" and looking at Mary, as if to gather &s;ome information from her concerning who and what they were, &s;he conti|nued, "Ah, ye mu&s;t comfort one another, &s;eeing, as I &s;uppo&s;e, ye be &s;ent here by our Lord's or|ders; and to be &s;ure it is a melancholy place, and &s;om how I never thought as I could a been in it &s;o long at a time; but u&s;e makes perfect, and I bent &s;o feared now as I was la&s;t night; and when I comes again to get your dinners, I thinks I &s;hant be afeard at all."</P>
<P>"No," &s;aid Laura, "here is nothing to be afraid of; and I mu&s;t de&s;ire you will give me the keys of all the rooms in the Abbey, that I may have the &s;atisfaction of going over them."</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="035640_0024_100692AA11E4FA78">
"Why," &s;aid Dame Giles, "then here they be (at the &s;ame time giving her a bunch of ru&s;ty keys); but I think as how you had better be con|tented with this here room, and them that ye &s;ee below, for I believe the others be but di&s;mal pla|ces, by all account; for I never &s;eed them &s;ince I was a little un, and then went but a little way, and we was a good many on us."</P>
<P>"And what did you &s;ee?" &s;aid Mary, impa|tiently.</P>
<P>"Laws, Madam!" &s;aid Dame Giles, "I cant remember;" and &s;o &s;aying &s;he ha&s;tened to leave them to make the &s;earch by them&s;elves, le&s;t they &s;hould have reque&s;ted her to accompany them.</P>
<P>She was no &s;ooner gone, and their breakfa&s;t over, than Laura, taking up the keys, &s;aid, "Come Mary, let us begin our &s;urvey. I pro|mi&s;e my&s;elf great amu&s;ement from the employ|ment, and I de&s;ire you will have no fears."</P>
<P>Mary looked as if &s;he had rather have been excu&s;ed; but ca&s;ting her eyes round the room with a fearful kind of ob&s;ervation, the &s;un, which glimmering through the narrow panes of gla&s;s,
<PB N="26" REF="035640_0025_100692ADD1E5AA40">
diffu&s;ed a cheering light, and rendered every ob|ject le&s;s gloomy than it had appeared the night before by only the light of the candles; &s;he therefore con&s;ented to attend Laura, who led the way; and having left their chamber, &s;he proceed|ed to her right along a low dark gallery, on the &s;ides of which &s;ome doors opened into &s;mall rooms, mo&s;t of them dark, and others admitting but &s;mall portion of light, entirely without furniture except an old high backed chair, or the remain of an old &s;tuffed couch.</P>
<P>The end of the gallery terminated in a narrow &s;tone &s;tair ca&s;e, down which Laura, followed <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> her trembling companion, de&s;cended.

<P>Laura endeavored to &s;ummon all her courage, and, regardle&s;s of her companion's entreaties, was venturing to explore the cloi&s;ter, when a ru&s;tling noi&s;e made her &s;tart, and retreat from the low arch which led to its entrance.</P>
<P>Mary &s;creamed with affright, and &s;tood with her hands held before her eyes, left they &s;hould encounter &s;ome &s;ight too terrific for her to &s;up|port. Laura likewi&s;e trembled; the boughs of the yew tree waved their dark branches again&s;t the window, and the whole appearance of the place augmented her fears. She took her com|panion's arm, and was ha&s;tily preparing to return, when a large trunk, or coffer, which &s;tood in one corner of the room, attracted her notice, and &s;he
<PB N="28" REF="035640_0027_100692B3064C26F0">
in&s;tantly accounted for the ru&s;tling, by &s;uppo&s;ing that a rat or mou&s;e might be within&s;ide of it; and, as this idea di&s;pelled her fears, and renewed her courage, &s;he advanced to the place where it &s;tood, determined to lift up the lid, and &s;ee what it contained. She did &s;o; but how was &s;he &s;truck with horror and a&s;toni&s;hment, when the &s;keleton of a human body pre&s;ented it&s;elf to her affrighted view! She gave an involuntary &s;cream, and drop|ping the lid from her trembling hand, the &s;ound, echoing through the hollow roofs, vibrated with terror upon her palpitating heart; and &s;he had ju&s;t &s;ufficient power to &s;ay to Mary, in a tremulous voice, "Let us be gone."</P>
<P>Mary, who had not &s;een what the trunk con|tained, but remained &s;ome paces behind, with her hands covering her eyes, on perceiving that Laura had di&s;covered &s;omething frightful, was &s;till more alarmed, and ha&s;tily advanced to make an e&s;cape from a room, which, from the fir&s;t mo|ment &s;he beheld it, had filled her with apprehen|&s;ions.</P>
<P>Laura had ju&s;t &s;trength enough to lock the door, and then proceeded back again to their own apartment, which, in compari&s;on with tho&s;e they had been viewing, appeared light and plea&s;ant.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="035640_0028_100692B842943F70">
Mary congratulated her&s;elf on her return, and told Laura &s;he hoped &s;he had now enough of ex|ploring the Abbey, which pre&s;ented nothing but di&s;mal places and frightful objects; and &s;he had no doubt was haunted by &s;ome of the people who had, &s;he was &s;ure, been murdered there; nor had &s;he any doubt but their gho&s;ts would appear at night, and inform them who were their murderers.</P>
<P>Laura begged &s;he would not give way to &s;uch idle fancies. "That I have been frightened," &s;ays &s;he, "I confe&s;s; and I al&s;o confe&s;s, that I am a&s;hamed of my&s;elf for being &s;o. A little rea|&s;on and recollection will conquer my fears, and enable me, at &s;ome future day, to put my de&s;ign in execution, and &s;urvey every part of the Abbey. What was there to fear in &s;eeing the bones of a fellow-creature, who&s;e peaceful a&s;hes were as qui|etly depo&s;ited there as in the mouldering earth? As to gho&s;ts, &s;he believed in no &s;uch thing; it was not the dead from whom &s;he had any appre|hen&s;ions, and &s;he would never believe that the righteous Judge of all the earth, and on whom alone &s;he placed her confidence, would &s;uffer her to be vi&s;ited and terrified for the &s;ins of former

ages. If any nece&s;&s;ary di&s;coveries were to be made thro' her means, &s;he might, and ought to be thankful for being con&s;idered as an in&s;trument worthy to bring good out of evil. That we &s;hould be alarmed at the &s;ight of our fellow-crea|tures, when they had no longer any power to hurt us, was a &s;ad proof of the weakne&s;s and de|pravity of our nature, and &s;he owned &s;he felt the force of that depravity in having been &s;o much frightened at what &s;he had &s;een; and although &s;he could not boa&s;t of any &s;uperior courage, yet it &s;hewed her the nece&s;&s;ity of making the utmo&s;t of that rea&s;on which had been &s;o liberally diffu&s;ed in our compo&s;itions for the be&s;t and wi&s;e&s;t purpo&s;|es." Thus &s;he rea&s;oned, and having no one to oppo&s;e her arguments (for Mary &s;at in &s;ilent ad|miration of her judgement and eloquence), &s;he had worked her&s;elf up to a kind of enthu&s;ia&s;tic courage, and &s;aid &s;he would again venture to complete her de&s;ign, and would not even a&s;k Ma|ry to accompany her, if &s;he had any fears; for her own part &s;he felt equal to the attempt, and was ri&s;ing in order to put her de&s;ign in execution, when Mary be&s;ought her to de&s;i&s;t: "Pray," &s;ays &s;he, "defer it till Dame Giles comes at dinner time, and perhaps &s;he will go with you; for, as
<PB N="31" REF="035640_0030_100692BD7223B568">
to my&s;elf, I cannot accompany you; and I &s;hould be as much afraid to &s;tay here alone."</P>
<P>Laura allowed her&s;elf to be per&s;uaded, and had le&s;s difficulty in getting Mary to take a walk with her on the out&s;ide of the Abbey before the &s;un went down, for &s;he had no &s;ort of objection to turning her back upon &s;o di&s;mal an abode, and would have been heartily glad never to have &s;et her foot in the in&s;ide any more. They according|ly proceeded down the &s;tairca&s;e, and out of the door through which they had entered the preced|ing night.</P>
<P>Laura had now an opportunity of ob&s;erving, that the Abbey was &s;ituated in a deep valley, &s;ur|rounded by hills of an enormous and &s;tupendous height, who&s;e craggy tops &s;eemed to bend over the &s;pace that contained a few &s;cattered cottages, which, with a &s;mall old church and the Abbey, formed the whole of the village. She proceeded to a ri&s;ing ground to the right of the building, from whence &s;he had a more perfect view of the Abbey, the length of which appeared to be &s;ome hundred feet, though it &s;eemed much longer than it really was from the lowne&s;s of the &s;tructure. The church was a building of the &s;ame date; du|ty
<PB N="32" REF="035640_0031_100692C08D0DC818">
was &s;ometimes performed in it by a neighbor|ing clergyman, but it appeared, as well as the Abbey, in a very decayed &s;tate. A low arch, or cloi&s;ter, &s;eemed to run from the right wing of the Abbey, and joined the church-yard.</P>
<P>Upon examining the &s;ituation of the windows, and particularly the yew-tree near one of them, Laura was convinced that this arch was the &s;ame that enclo&s;ed the pa&s;&s;age, or cloi&s;ter, which led from the di&s;mal room wherein &s;he had &s;een the &s;keleton; and &s;he again reprobated her fears when &s;he con&s;idered that, as the cloi&s;ter communicated with the church-yard, it was ea&s;y to &s;uppo&s;e a &s;keleton might well be conveyed to a place &s;o near it, for want of room, or for &s;ome other rea&s;on; and vexed that this idea had not occurred to her &s;ooner, &s;he again condemned her fearfulne&s;s, and determined to make a &s;econd attempt as &s;oon as another day pre&s;ented it&s;elf.</P>
<P>The hour now approaching when the day be|gan to got dreary, and ob&s;erving Dame Giles coming to prepare their dinner, &s;he propo&s;ed to Mary to return to the Abbey, who followed her companion, although with reluctance; for &s;he
<PB N="33" REF="035640_0032_100692C254F0D318">
had much rather have encountered the inclemency of the weather, or any other inconvenience, than again venture into the gloomy Abbey; the whole of which Laura was &s;o de&s;irous of exploring, that &s;he was with difficulty per&s;uaded from making the attempt, even though the day was &s;hutting in.</P>
<P>The night pa&s;&s;ed like the preceding one, ex|cept that Laura, when awakened by Mary, almo&s;t fancied &s;he heard a faint whi&s;per at the chamber door; but &s;he was unwilling to give credit to &s;uch improbable alarms, and was re&s;olved to place them to tho&s;e impo&s;itions of fancy, which the &s;tillne&s;s of the night, and the &s;ituation of the place might naturally in&s;pire.</P>
<P>Her courage completely returned with the light of the morning, and &s;he aro&s;e plea&s;ed with the &s;cheme &s;he had projected of examining every corn|er, as well as every room in the Abbey, feeling her&s;elf &s;uperior to any fears the enterpri&s;e might occa&s;ion. For this purpo&s;e &s;he reque&s;ted Dame Giles would &s;tay with Mary during the time &s;he &s;hould be gone; and &s;he really felt &s;o courageous that &s;he preferred going alone, le&s;t Mary's fears, by &s;ugge&s;ting fooli&s;h fancies, might create &s;ome|thing like them in her&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="035640_0033_100692C7E7F20B30">
She fir&s;t proceeded down the great &s;tair ca&s;e, and examined the rooms below, of which &s;he had not taken &s;ufficient notice either on her entrance, or when &s;he went to walk. The hall was large, dark, and the paving decayed; a ru&s;ty helmet, and a large &s;word of an immen&s;e length, hung again&s;t a wall half covered with green damp, a folding door, with a top pannel broke, opened to a large room, in the form of a rotundo, with a high arched win|dow, on which were emblazoned many coats of arms on painted gla&s;s. Heraldry was Laura's fav|ourite &s;tudy, but &s;he could not give up the pre&s;ent time to inve&s;tigate the arms of the hou&s;e of Oak|endale, &s;o much was &s;he bent upon making di&s;|coveries more gratifying to her curio&s;ity. On the left of this room, a door, which appeared in better pre&s;ervation, and more modern form than any of the others, attracted her notice. She in|&s;tantly opened it, and a full length picture of a Lady, in a Vandyke dre&s;s, arre&s;ted her attention. The frame had been gilt, and was of heavy carv|ed work; but &s;eemed falling to decay, and the canva&s;s in &s;ome places was loo&s;ened from it. The portrait exhibited a countenance of the mo&s;t at|tractive kind; the complexion was beautiful, and
<PB N="35" REF="035640_0034_100692CA483DE4D0">
the features regular. Laura's eyes were rivetted to it. She could not account for the fa&s;cinating expre&s;&s;ion which allured her attentive ob&s;ervation; &s;he &s;tood contemplating the &s;oft features till &s;he almo&s;t fancied the &s;weet mouth &s;miled upon her, and &s;he was reluctantly withdrawing her&s;elf from &s;o plea&s;ing a portrait, in the countenance of which &s;he felt, &s;he knew not how, intere&s;ted; when a faint expre&s;&s;ion of &s;urpri&s;e bur&s;t from her lips, at ob&s;erving upon the floor near the picture, a &s;attin letter-ca&s;e of her own work! Ah! well did &s;he recognize the parting gift &s;he had pre&s;ent|ed to Eugene&mdash;her earlie&s;t lover&mdash;her fir&s;t friend&mdash;her long lamented Eugene! What &s;en&s;ations did the &s;ight produce! "Ah!" &s;ays &s;he, "he mu&s;t have been here; what could have brought him to this &s;eque&s;tered place, and where is he now?"</P>
<P>The la&s;t idea re&s;ted with a fearful pau&s;e upon her terrified imagination, which in&s;tantly ran through a train of melancholy and &s;ad reflections. She &s;tood lo&s;t in wonder and amaze, and her thoughts bewildered in a labyrinth of &s;trange perplexity! The idea of the &s;keleton in the trunk ru&s;hed upon her recollection with a terrible pre|&s;entiment that it might be Eugene's and &s;he felt her blood curdle with horror at the thought. She lo<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">

all fear of her own &s;ituation in the &s;urpri&s;e the above circum&s;tance had occa&s;ioned. She &s;tood fixed with the letter-ca&s;e in her hand, the identity of which &s;he could not doubt, having the name of Laura worked, not only by her own hand, but in her hair in the in&s;ide, upon which her eyes re&s;ted in a kind of &s;tupor; and in this &s;ituation &s;he would have remained had not the &s;ound of foot&s;teps down the great &s;tair-ca&s;e rou&s;ed her from her reverie, and made her turn her head not with fear, but in expectation of &s;eeing &s;ome new wonder; it was, however, only Mary and Dame Giles, who, hav|ing thought every moment an hour &s;ince her de|parture, and dreading le&s;t &s;omething had happen|ed to her, their impatience and curio&s;ity for once conquered their fears, and by an effort of courage they ventured down the great &s;tairs in &s;earch of her. Laura could have excu&s;ed the intru&s;ion, and, upon finding her pale and trembling, they con|cluded &s;he had been fearfully alarmed, and be|&s;ought her to return with them up &s;tairs. Her in|coherent an&s;wers to their que&s;tions confirmed their belief that fright had affected her &s;en&s;es, and they offered her all the con&s;olation they could. When &s;he returned to the chamber &s;he recovered in &s;ome degree, but &s;till remained low and lo&s;t in recollec|tion.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="035640_0036_100692D1992ABBD8">
The next day &s;he told Mary &s;he had met with a &s;urpri&s;e, but no fright; and added that &s;he had &s;o little fear, &s;he &s;hould again walk over the Abbey, and begged &s;he might not be interrupted. Thus &s;ome time pa&s;&s;ed, and, although &s;he made &s;everal attempts to vi&s;it the room, which contained the &s;keleton, &s;he never found her courage quite equal to the enterpri&s;e; and, though &s;he rea&s;oned upon the ab&s;urdity of her fears, and determined to go there, yet her &s;teps generally led to the room where &s;he had found the letter-ca&s;e, and where the beautiful picture always attracted her admir|ation, and engaged her &s;tay.</P>
<P>Meantime Lord Oakendale grew impatient that he heard nothing from her. The footman had &s;everal times been di&s;patched to the village in or|der to enquire how &s;he bore her &s;olitude, and if &s;he made no complaints; for Lord Oakendale was in hopes that, by placing her in this dreary Abbey, with no companion but Mary, (who&s;e education and manner of life had not been &s;uch as could render her mind congenial with Laura's) as &s;he could have no re&s;ources from books, or a|ny other amu&s;ement, her &s;pirits would become &s;o

depre&s;&s;ed, and her mind &s;o enervated, that &s;he would gladly fly to him for &s;uccour and friend|&s;hip, rather than be condemned to a hateful &s;oli|tude, like that of Oakendale Abbey.</P>
<P>Laura's character he had quite mi&s;taken, or rather he had no idea of &s;o noble a mind inhabit|ing a form which he con&s;idered only as a volup|tuary. Finding, therefore that the footman al|ways returned with accounts of her being content|ed, and making no complaints, he determined, as &s;oon as the &s;pring &s;hould be a little advanced, to make her a vi&s;it at the Abbey; and not without the diabolical idea, that, if he could not prevail upon her to be favorable to his wi&s;hes, the Abbey was a place well calculated for the very wor&s;t de&s;igns.</P>
<P>The&s;e intentions, however, were confined to his own brea&s;t, as the fitte&s;t receptacle for them. Not the mo&s;t di&s;tant hint was given of his inten|tion, lea&s;t Laura, upon hearing it, might medi|tate an e&s;cape, although that was a circum&s;tance next to impo&s;&s;ible to be effected, from the &s;itua|tion of the place.</P>
<P>Meantime as the days grew longer, &s;he fre|quently walked with Mary to the di&s;tance of a
<PB N="39" REF="035640_0038_100692DA8CD43DA0">
mile or two; the views were picture&s;que, wild, and romantic; and when &s;he climbed to the top of the hills &s;he had a pro&s;pect of a beautiful lake, which &s;ometimes afforded her a di&s;tant hope of e&s;cape, as &s;he had heard that the&s;e lakes were vi|&s;ited in the &s;ummer by the admirers of picture&s;que land&s;cape. The Abbey lo&s;t much of its horrors by being inhabited by &s;o fair a form, and the pea&s;ants of the village would now venture as far as the gate, and even peep in at the windows, dive&s;ted of their former fears. When the weather was rainy, Lau|ra made a long gallery in the Abbey her walk, and Mary grew &s;o fearle&s;s that &s;he would remain in the chamber by her&s;elf, although &s;he &s;till per|&s;i&s;ted in &s;aying &s;he heard noi&s;es and whi&s;pering in the night.</P>
<P>Laura had never yet been in the room which contained the &s;keleton, &s;he often de&s;igned it, and had once or twice made the attempt; but the idea that it might be Eugene's always threw a fearful gloom upon her heart; and having que&s;tioned Dame Giles concerning the vi&s;itors to the Abbey &s;ince her remembrance, &s;he once told her of a gentleman's never having been heard of after having the keys to let him&s;elf into the Abbey. This account filled Laura's heart with cruel ap|prehen&s;ions,
<PB N="40" REF="035640_0039_100692E0545DCE60">
and confirmed conjectures which at times her imagination would rai&s;e up. In tho&s;e moments &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed a gang of banditti conceal|ed in a &s;ubterraneous vault, who ru&s;hing upon Eugene at the moment he was exploring their &s;ecret haunts, having robbed and murdered him, had put his body in the trunk, had carele&s;&s;ly drop|ped the letter-ca&s;e in the room where &s;he found it.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;ad reflections &s;ometimes deterred her from making the attempt, and other times rai&s;ed her re&s;entment and her courage at the &s;ame time; and when the thoughts of her &s;ituation occurred to her, it gave her a contempt for life; &s;he would &s;ay, "Yes, I will brave the ruffians, and gladly &s;hare the fate of my dear Eugene. Per|haps my bones may then be depo&s;ited in the &s;ame trunk with his, and in death at lea&s;t we &s;hall not be divided." But &s;uch wild imaginations were generally &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, and deemed improper by her better judgment; and &s;he would then be thankful to Providence, who had given her &s;trength of mind to re&s;i&s;t &s;uch idle delu&s;ions, and &s;ubmit, with re&s;ignation and gratitude, to him, who&s;e di&s;pen&s;ations had, in many in&s;tances, been &s;o manife&s;ted in her favor.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="035640_0040_100692E1F56553A8">
She was ruminating upon &s;ubjects of this nature one evening, when &s;he was walking alone in the gallery by moonlight. The brightne&s;s of that luminary &s;hone full upon the apartment, and &s;he was amu&s;ing her&s;elf with ob&s;erving its reflecting the narrow ca&s;ements to almo&s;t the breadth of the gallery. She next contemplated her own &s;hadow as &s;he walked; but, how was &s;he a&s;toni&s;hed, and how did &s;he &s;tand agha&s;t, when &s;he &s;aw another &s;hadow be&s;ides her own, which appeared larger, and to be that of a man! Her fortitude at once for&s;ook her; &s;he flew to the door of the gallery, and in a faint voice called Mary. Mary was in the chamber; &s;he &s;tood motionle&s;s with &s;urpri&s;e and terror; but having a little recovered &s;he pro|ceeded to the chamber, where &s;he found Mary almo&s;t as much frightened as her&s;elf, at being left alone at that time in the evening.</P>
<P>Laura, as &s;oon as her trembling breath would allow her to articulate, related the cau&s;e of her fright, and begged Mary would return with her to the gallery, in order to inve&s;tigate this phe|nomenon; but no per&s;ua&s;ion could prevail on Mary to accompany her; on the contrary, &s;he
<PB N="42" REF="035640_0041_100692E707434C78">
was for fa&s;tening up the door of the chamber, as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, to prevent either the &s;hadow or the real &s;ub&s;tance from vi&s;iting them.</P>
<P>Laura ruminated upon the circum&s;tance till (as u&s;ual) her fears became le&s;s; &s;he con&s;idered that, by &s;ome oblique reflection of the moon, two figures might be reflected from one; and &s;he de|termined to go to the gallery again, and try, in every direction, how her own &s;hadow might be reflected, and lead her to the mi&s;take; and &s;he ea&s;ily fancied that her fears had magnified the figure, and likewi&s;e given it the re&s;emblance of a man.</P>
<P>Vexed at the idea of being appalled at her own &s;hadow, and re&s;olving in&s;tantly to be cconvined &s;he again &s;et forward to the gallery, which &s;he found &s;till and quiet as &s;he had left it. This en|couraged her boldly to advance to the end of it, and to try, in every direction &s;he could place her|&s;elf, in what manner her &s;hadow might be reflect|ed, &s;o as to give it the repre&s;entation of two figures; but, after walking, &s;tanding &s;till, both towards the windows, and at a di&s;tance, cro&s;&s;ing the gallery in every different part, and placing her&s;elf in every light, yet &s;till &s;he could perceive
<PB N="43" REF="035640_0042_100692E97A707EB8">
nothing but her own &s;ingle &s;hadow! Having tired her&s;elf with conjectures, and vexed that &s;he could make no di&s;covery, &s;he ha&s;tened back to her ap|partment, where &s;he pa&s;&s;ed the night, re&s;tle&s;s and unea&s;y, vainly endeavouring to account for the appearance &s;he had &s;een, without the mo&s;t di&s;tant clue to lead her to it.</P>
<P>The unaccountable appearance of this &s;hadow occupied her thoughts for &s;everal days, and &s;he at la&s;t per&s;uaded her&s;elf that it mu&s;t have been the deception of her own &s;ight, which, although pretty good, might for once have deceived her, e&s;pecially as &s;he made the &s;ame experiment the &s;ucceeding night at the &s;ame hour; but it led to no di&s;covery, for &s;he could &s;ee but one &s;hadow; and having, by degrees, and by rea&s;oning upon the impo&s;&s;ibility, conquered every idea of fear it had at fir&s;t occa&s;ioned, &s;he again re&s;umed her in|tention of looking at the room which contained the &s;keleton.</P>
<P>One day, that had been uncommonly rainy, which had prevented her taking her favorite walk upon the hill, and her mind was un&s;ettled, from having no employment to fill up the time, or to
<PB N="44" REF="035640_0043_100692ECB3086C30">
chace away the melancholy which her &s;ituation in&s;pired, after much con&s;ideration, &s;he determin|ed to bend her &s;teps down the &s;tone &s;tair-ca&s;e. For this purpo&s;e &s;he &s;ummoned all her re&s;olution, and having, with fervent devotion, recommend|ed her&s;elf to that Power, who always protects the innocent, and who&s;e mercy is infinite, &s;he pro|ceeded to the room, the lock of which turned ea&s;ily as before; &s;he &s;urveyed it with compo&s;ed attention. The trunk &s;tood exactly in the &s;ame place; &s;he lifted up the lid, and the &s;ame gha&s;t|ly &s;keleton pre&s;ented it&s;elf to her view. She con|templated it with a mixture of horror and pity. "Ah!" &s;ays &s;he, "would I could know what bo|dy-enveloped the&s;e bones; perhaps thou art en|titled to my tendere&s;t regards." The idea that it might be the remains of the murdered, loved, Eugene, occurred to her &s;ad memory, and the tears fell from her eyes in large drops upon the object which excited them.</P>
<P>From this melancholy &s;pectacle &s;he turned to the dark cloi&s;ter which, as &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed, led to the church-yard. The gloomy appearance of the entrance for a moment intimidated her, and &s;he was almo&s;t inclined to go back, when a ray of courage enlivening her &s;pirits, &s;he grew re&s;olute&punc;
<PB N="45" REF="035640_0044_100692F01C58F158">
and determined to proceed. She &s;tooped her head as &s;he entered the arch, and found it quite dark; but as &s;he advanced it grew lighter, and &s;he perceived that &s;he de&s;cended, and the roof then admitted of her &s;tanding upright. She likewi&s;e found that the light proceeded from &s;ome open|ing at the end, which &s;he conjectured was the open air, and that the end of the cloi&s;ter would bring her to the church-yard; &s;he therefore bold|ly advanced, when, upon a nearer approach, &s;he perceived that the light glimmered through &s;ome loo&s;e boards in the form of a partition, without a door, or any apparent opening. She looked through the cracks, and perceived it was a room, and that the light proceeded from a ca&s;ement at the end of it. She pu&s;hed hard again&s;t it, in or|der to get in; but it &s;eemed beyond her &s;trength. She felt di&s;appointed, and was turning back the way &s;he had come, when an impul&s;e of curio&s;ity impelled her once more to look through the cracks of the boards, in order to take a more accurate &s;urvey of a place which &s;eemed fenced off for &s;ome particular purpo&s;e. She then fancied &s;he &s;aw &s;omething like white linen hang up on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide; but &s;he could not di&s;tingui&s;h it per|fectly,
<PB N="46" REF="035640_0045_100692F5DCDCFE08">
as the confined place through which &s;he looked prevented her. She likewi&s;e fancied that &s;he heard a &s;light noi&s;e; but &s;he was determined not to let any trifling &s;ound, occa&s;ioned, perhaps by the wind, or a thou&s;and other cau&s;es, alarm and divert her from her purpo&s;e; &s;o keeping her eye fixed, and clo&s;e to the di&s;jointed boards, whil&s;t her body was perfectly &s;till, her eye en|deavored to &s;crutinize and inve&s;tigate every ob|ject it could collect through a &s;pace &s;o narrow; when, after a &s;light noi&s;e, and a &s;hade of &s;ome|thing rather darkening the view, a large rolling eye-ball met her own, and &s;he in&s;tantly &s;unk down; at the &s;ame time giving a faint inward &s;cream: the &s;hock was more than &s;he could bear. For a few moments all her faculties were &s;u&s;pend|ed, and her limbs, which had refu&s;ed to &s;upport her, &s;eemed &s;tiffened with fright and a&s;toni&s;hment. She attempted to ri&s;e &s;everal times before &s;he could accompli&s;h it; and when &s;he &s;tood up, &s;he made &s;everal efforts before her trembling legs could &s;upport her &s;ufficiently to walk. Her mind was a chaos of horror and confu&s;ion; &s;he invol|untarily bent her &s;teps to return; and, having feebly tottered <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span">

&s;it down upon the trunk which contained the &s;kel|eton, in order to re&s;t, and prevent her falling a &s;econd time.</P>
<P>Her heart throbbed as if it was bur&s;ting, and a violent flood of tears afforded her &s;ome relief. She &s;at for &s;ome minutes looking &s;tedfa&s;tly at the entrance of the cloi&s;ter, expecting every moment &s;omething to arre&s;t her affrighted &s;en&s;es. All continued &s;till; nothing more horrible could ap|pear than &s;he had already &s;een, and &s;he found her|&s;elf quite unequal to the ta&s;k &s;he had undertaken. After finding her&s;elf a little recovered, &s;he ha&s;ten|ed back as fa&s;t as her trembling limbs could car|ry her, determined never more to endeavor at an inve&s;tigation which &s;he found had too &s;erious an effect upon her &s;pirits.</P>
<P>When &s;he returned to the chamber, her pale and terrified countenance, with her eyes red, and almo&s;t &s;tarting from their orbits, convinced Ma|ry that &s;he had encountered &s;omething extremely horrid, and &s;he was as much afraid to enquire as the other was incapable of an&s;wering, left &s;he &s;hould hear more than her weak mind could &s;up|port.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="035640_0047_100692FD0350A9D0">
Laura threw her&s;elf upon the bed in an agony of grief and terror; her mind was too much di&s;|compo&s;ed by what &s;he had &s;een, to let rea&s;on bear any influence. She found her &s;pirits had received a &s;hock, which they could not well bear; &s;he now blamed her&s;elf for having attempted to make an inve&s;tigation which had led her to encounter &s;o much terror.</P>
<P>Mary could get but few an&s;wers to her que&s;|tions, and therefore gave up a&s;king her.</P>
<P>Laura continued many days in a motionle&s;s kind of apathy, and a &s;low fever preyed upon her &s;pi|rits. She made many melancholy reflections up|on her cruel &s;ituation, which only added to her depre&s;&s;ion. From this, however, &s;he was rou&s;ed by the daughter of Dame Giles, who, as &s;he was one day &s;etting the room in order, and &s;eeing Laura look grave and low, a&s;&s;umed a delighted countenance, and &s;aid, "This ould place will be quite another thing &s;oon."</P>
<P>"Why," replied Laura, "what &s;hould make it another thing?"</P>
<P>"Oh!" &s;aid the girl, "but I believe I &s;hould not tell you."</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="035640_0048_1006930075175AB8">
"Yes," &s;aid Laura, "You may tell me any thing; I &s;hall not betray you."</P>
<P>"Why, then," &s;ays the girl, "but 'tis a great &s;ecret, and mother would kill me if &s;he knowed as how I talked about it; but my Lord is a com|ing, and &s;ome o'the rooms are here to be made &s;o foin!"</P>
<P>"And who told you &s;o?" replied Laura. "And when does he come? and are you certain of it?"</P>
<P>All the&s;e que&s;tions &s;he a&s;ked Peggy in a breath, and with a wild &s;urpri&s;e; but Peggy could not, or would not, divulge more information than &s;he had already communicated; and Laura was left to meditate upon the intelligence with as many, or, perhaps, more cruel reflections than her re|cent fright had occa&s;ioned.</P>
<P>Various apprehen&s;ions a&s;&s;ailed her imagination, and not a ray of comfort &s;hone upon her recollec|tion; all was dreary in the per&s;pective. Her mind was now as active as it had been before pa&s;|&s;ive. Her fears of &s;upernatural &s;pirits, and &s;up|po&s;ed murderers, gave way to tho&s;e of more cer|tainty; and &s;he fearle&s;sly traver&s;ed many parts

of the Abbey, although &s;he did not venture to the part of it where &s;he had been &s;o much terrifi|ed. Indeed &s;he never could per&s;uade her&s;elf to believe in gho&s;ts. That there were beings in the Abbey be&s;ides them&s;elves &s;he had received ocular demon&s;trati<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters">s; but of what nature they were, &s;he was totally ignorant; and her mind had been too much confu&s;ed and oppre&s;&s;ed to form the mo&s;t di&s;tant conjecture. Now that her fears had, by Peggy's intelligence, been rendered alive to rea|&s;on, the retro&s;pection furni&s;hed her with &s;ome in|ferences not altogether impo&s;&s;ible; and, upon rea|&s;oning with her&s;elf upon the &s;ubject, &s;he thought it more than probable, that Lord Oakendale had cau&s;ed and ordered the&s;e appearances, in order to intimidate her, that &s;he might fly to his arms for refuge again&s;t alarms which &s;eemed &s;o incom|prehen&s;ible. She knew the whole village was his property, and all the inhabitants were his va&s;&s;als. From &s;uch a combination it were ea&s;y to place people in unfrequented parts of the Abbey to whi&s;per and make noi&s;es to occa&s;ion terror. The &s;keleton, the &s;hadow, and the eye-ball, might be managed by his Lord&s;hip's contrivance; con&s;e|quently they lo&s;t their terror, and &s;he looked up|on

all that was pa&s;t as an artful delu&s;ion, pre-con|certed to further and complete his purpo&s;e; &s;he, therefore, as heretofore, condemned her&s;elf for being &s;o ea&s;ily impo&s;ed upon, and determined henceforward to di&s;regard all appearances, and, if po&s;&s;ible to think of making her e&s;cape.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to Mary &s;he did not think her &s;uf|ficiently in her intere&s;t to tru&s;t her with any &s;cheme &s;he might project; neither did &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;s cou|rage, or &s;trength of mind, to be of &s;ervice to her in any dangerous enterpri&s;e; &s;he therefore thought it mo&s;t prudent to rely upon her own manage|ment, and entirely tru&s;t to her own contrivance for the furthering of any plan, by which &s;he might hope to e&s;cape from a &s;ituation &s;o perilous.</P>
<P>She had, by the&s;e &s;ugge&s;tions, worked up her mind to a degree of boldne&s;s, bordering upon de&s;peration; and, in a rhap&s;ody of di&s;tre&s;&s;ed cou|rage, &s;he exclaimed, "Would &s;ome airy &s;pirits did indeed inhabit this Abbey, who would pro|tect innocence, and &s;hield me from the &s;nares of villainy and terror!"</P>
<P>As &s;he fini&s;hed the la&s;t words, &s;he was &s;tartled by a noi&s;e like the &s;hutting of a door, and a di&s;|tant foot&s;tep; but, as &s;he had made up her mind as
<PB N="52" REF="035640_0051_10069309C1D09D68">
to di&s;regarding the noi&s;es, and indeed fear of that nature &s;eemed to be entirely bani&s;hed from her brea&s;t, &s;he only turned about with a contemptuous expre&s;&s;ion of countenance, and fell into a medita|tion on her e&s;cape. As &s;he had never been pro|hibited walking round the Abbey, up the hills and in the vicinity of the village, &s;he formed the re&s;olution of extending her walk &s;o as to get quite away, taking the fir&s;t path that offered, after &s;he had got from the village.</P>
<P>The idea charmed her, and but one difficulty aro&s;e to prevent her de&s;ign; and that was, the walking out by her&s;elf, as Mary had always been her companion in the walks &s;he had hitherto tak|en, and indeed would be afraid to be left alone in the Abbey.</P>
<P>The idea of leaving one, who&s;e fears &s;he knew would nearly overpower her &s;en&s;es, was not on|ly matter of difficulty, but of regret; and &s;he truly felt for the di&s;tre&s;s Mary would experience when night approached, and &s;he found her&s;elf alone, de&s;erted by her companion.</P>
<P>The tender and affectionate heart of Laura could not endure the idea of acting &s;o cruel a part to one, who in no in&s;tance had ever &s;hewn
<PB N="53" REF="035640_0052_1006930F19AE7680">
her the lea&s;t unkindne&s;s. To be &s;ure her virtues where of that negative kind, that &s;he could form no reliance upon her friend&s;hip, but then, on the other hand, &s;he had been in &s;ome degree, the cho|&s;en companion of her &s;olitude, and to leave her a prey to &s;ufferings her mind was not able to &s;up|port, was a cruelty of which Laura was incapa|ble, and could not put inpractice, even if her e&s;|cape had depended upon tho&s;e terms; &s;he therefore, after much con&s;ideration, told Mary, "Not to be alarmed if &s;ome of the &s;pectres, which haunted the Abbey, &s;hould entirely carry her off, as they had done the gentleman concerning whom Dame Giles had told them, for that &s;he was determined to venture over every part of it, and it might be &s;he might never return; for &s;he had already &s;een and heard enough to know that &s;omething be&s;ides them&s;elves re&s;ided there, and &s;he therefore advi&s;|ed her to be prepared for her ab&s;ence."</P>
<P>Mary, terrified at hearing her talk in this man|ner, begged her to de&s;i&s;t from any &s;uch de&s;ign repre&s;enting, and recalling to her recollection, how much &s;he had been alarmed at her la&s;t at|tempt, as well as by the circum&s;tance of the &s;ha|dow.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="035640_0053_10069312780C1948">
Laura, however, was not to be per&s;uaded, and told Mary &s;he was prepared for any alarm, and only advi&s;ed her, in ca&s;e &s;he &s;hould not return be|fore night, not to &s;tay in the Abbey by her&s;elf; but, before the evening was far advanced, to go down to the cottage of Aaron Giles, and beg his protection.</P>
<P>Mary did not he&s;itate to promi&s;e &s;he would not &s;tay there by her&s;elf; for nothing, indeed, would have induced her to be there alone.</P>
<P>Laura, having arranged the plan &s;o far as con|cerned Mary, who&s;e comfort was by no means her lea&s;t object, left the Abbey in order to recon|noitre, and, at the &s;ame time, u&s;e Mary to the cu&s;tom of her going out without her; and, had any thing encouraging offered, to pur&s;ue her plan. But the evening being remarkable fine, the pea&s;ants were all out of their hou&s;es, and &s;he did not think this a time favourable for facilitat|ing her de&s;ign; &s;he therefore gave up the at|tempt, and returned to the Abbey, waiting im|patiently for a more favourable opportunity.</P>
<P>Meantime &s;ome of the rooms were cleaning out, and evident preparations were making for his Lord&s;hip's arrival.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="035640_0054_100693156610ACB8">
Some days had now elap&s;ed &s;ince Laura had &s;poken to Mary on the &s;ubject of her being car|ried away. She had formed various plans, but as yet had put none in execution; time wore a|way, and &s;he was in continual fear of being &s;ur|pri&s;ed by a vi&s;it from Lord Oakendale. This kept her mind in a con&s;tant perturbation, and ha&s;|tened her determination. On a fine afternoon, therefore, &s;he &s;trolled out by her&s;elf, and Mary impatiently awaited her return.</P>
<P>The evening began to clo&s;e, when Mary's fears for Laura, and &s;till greater apprehen&s;ions for her&s;elf, aro&s;e to a pitch of mi&s;ery and unea&s;ine&s;s &s;he could by no means &s;upport! She flew down the &s;tairs, and, opening the great door, &s;he threw her eyes about with a wild &s;tare of amazement; and, being afraid either to return, or to follow any of the paths &s;he had &s;ometimes frequented with Laura, &s;he ran as fa&s;t as her legs could carry her to the cottage of Aaron Giles, and terrified and &s;urpri&s;ed the whole family, by &s;aying, with wild affright, "That the gho&s;ts had carried a|way Laura, and &s;he would not for the world con|tinue in the Abbey by her&s;elf, for &s;he was &s;ure they would take her next."</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="035640_0055_10069318D21618B0">
They knew not what to make of her &s;tory, and, partly believing, and partly incredulous, they &s;allied out to the Abbey, where, vainly waiting, wondering, and calling to no purpo&s;e for near two hours, they concluded poor Laura had met with &s;ome cruel di&s;a&s;ter, and they returned di&s;|con&s;olate to the cottage. They lamented the fate of the unfortunate Lady, and &s;till more their own, when his Lord&s;hip &s;hould not find her at his arrival, which was now hourly expected; in which expectation we &s;hall, for the pre&s;ent, leave them, to give &s;ome account of Laura, for whom our readers may probably be more intere&s;ted.</P>
<P>The evening, on which &s;he left the Abbey, was uncommonly fine, and invited her to de&s;cend the other &s;ide of that hill, from which &s;he had more than once taken a view of the lake and the adjacent country. She would round the hill, and followed the fir&s;t path to her left&punc; it turned in &s;everal directions, and &s;he was puzzled which to pur&s;ue. After a&s;cending and de&s;cending amid&s;t a woody covert of brambles and high bu&s;hes, &s;he found her&s;elf in a thick wood at the bottom of the hill, which &s;he &s;till thought looked very near her. She was now in a clo&s;e dell, and looking about to &s;ee the way &s;he thought be&s;t to follow, &s;he

perceived an arch overgrown with ivy, and think|ing it might lead her into a more open and ex|tended tract, &s;he fearle&s;sly entered it. The arch narrowed upon her; &s;he nearly touched the roof, and it grew dark, yet &s;he proceeded;&mdash;it was a hiding place from her pur&s;uers, if it was nothing more. Fear &s;eemed to make no part of her compo&s;ition, and, having walked a con&s;iderable way, &s;he perceived &s;ome broken &s;teps; and, hav|ing a&s;cended them, a &s;mall door half open, &s;eem|ed to invite her to enter; and a room, extremely re&s;embling tho&s;e &s;he had &s;een in the Abbey, led her to &s;uppo&s;e that the winding of the wood had only brought her back again to the &s;ame place from which &s;he had taken &s;o much pains to e&s;cape. She felt vexed and di&s;appointed; but curio&s;ity compelled her to prove the certainty of her con|jecture.</P>
<P>The room afforded but little light, and that on|ly admitted by cha&s;ms in the wall; yet &s;he thought &s;he perceived a door at the end; and, as &s;he was now almo&s;t certain it was the Abbey, &s;he was in hopes of returning to the apartments they occu|pied before Mary &s;hould have quitted them; for, although her fears were pretty well &s;ub&s;ided, yet the idea of being alone all night in the Abbey

was not altogether &s;o comfortable; and &s;he thought, if Mary was gone, &s;he would follow her to the cottage of Aaron Giles. She was not de|ceived as to the door at the other end of the room; it was fa&s;tened on the &s;ide next to her, and &s;he undrew (as &s;he thought) a ru&s;ty bolt, and was advancing into another appartment, when a &s;ight, more horrible than imagination can form, pre|&s;ented it&s;elf to her. The dead body of a woman hung again&s;t the wall oppo&s;ite to the door &s;he had entered, with a coar&s;e cloth pinned over all but the face; the gha&s;tly and putrified appearance of which be&s;poke her to have been &s;ome time dead.</P>
<P>Laura gave a fearful &s;hriek, when a tall figure, dre&s;&s;ed only in a checked &s;hirt, &s;taggered towards her. The face was almo&s;t black; the eyes &s;eem|ed &s;tarting from the head; the mouth was widely extended, and made a kind of hallow gutteral &s;ound in attempting to articulate.</P>
<P>Laura &s;tood motionle&s;s; the figure pa&s;&s;ed her, and went through the door-way by which &s;he had entered, and the &s;ound of the foot&s;teps dwelt up|on her ear till they &s;eemed lo&s;t by di&s;tance. She trembled exceedingly; &s;he was afraid to follow and &s;he was equally afraid to &s;tay. After &s;ome
<PB N="59" REF="035640_0058_10069324F42D96F8">
moments of dreadful &s;u&s;pence, &s;he turned her eyes to the &s;hocking figure of the dead body; nature &s;hrunk from the &s;ight, and recoiled at the idea; &s;he moved &s;lowly to the door, thinking, if &s;he could once morce regain the wood, &s;he &s;hould be more &s;afe than where &s;he was. Alas! how were her fears increa&s;ed, and her &s;ituation rendered &s;till more dreadful, when &s;he found (upon at|tempting to open the door) a &s;pring lock on the other &s;ide had been mi&s;taken for a bolt; that it was now clo&s;e &s;hut, and &s;he had no po&s;&s;ible means of getting it open. The horrid creature that had pa&s;&s;ed her had gone through with &s;o much violence that the door clapped after him, whil&s;t &s;he was contemplating the other dreadful figure with which &s;he was now &s;hut up; nothing could be conceived more full of terror! The room was damp, and a &s;mall grated window only &s;erved to &s;hew her the gha&s;tly appearance of the body, ren|dered &s;till more terrific by the faint light which reflected on the face, and &s;erved to &s;hew Laura that night was approaching. Her fears increa&s;|ed; &s;he crept about the room as far as po&s;&s;ible from the melancholy object, and kept her eyes turned to the door of this di&s;mal place, from

whence &s;he had not the mo&s;t di&s;tant hope of mak|ing her e&s;cape.</P>
<P>With a mind tortured by the mo&s;t cruel ap|prehen&s;ions, &s;he could think of no expedient whereby to relieve her di&s;tre&s;s. She made &s;eve|ral attempts to open the door, but all were inef|fectual. The little &s;trength &s;he had was become &s;till le&s;s by trembling, and a faint &s;ickne&s;s occa&s;i|oned by terror. She &s;hut her eyes to avoid the painful object before her. She fancied &s;he heard groans. The idea of peri&s;hing for want was the lea&s;t of her fears. About midnight &s;he heard foot&s;teps gently approaching the door; a glim|mering light &s;hone under it, and di&s;played more fully the horror of her &s;ituation, all her courage was &s;ummoned to her aid, and all her courage could &s;carce &s;upport her in this extremity of dan|ger. She had turned her back upon the dead bo|dy, as an object too &s;hocking to look at; and &s;he now crept up in a corner of the room, on the &s;ame &s;ide with the door, where &s;he &s;tood clo&s;e, &s;till hop|ing to e&s;cape from &s;he knew not what; but the love of life is &s;o &s;trongly implanted in our nature, that when the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">larm of death comes, under what|&s;oever circum&s;tances, we make the la&s;t attempts to pre&s;erve it, however feeble they may be.</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="035640_0060_10068EFEE402B060">
Thus &s;he &s;tood trembling, awaiting a fate which &s;he every moment expected would be decided, when the door gently opened, and two men en|tered; the one carried a lantern, and the other a large board; and, as with a&s;toni&s;hed looks, they advanced towards her; her heart died within her, &s;he &s;unk down, and &s;aw and heard no more!</P>
<P>On recovering &s;he found her&s;elf laid on a coar&s;e bed, with an old woman &s;tanding by her, who&s;e looks te&s;tified &s;atisfaction when &s;he opened her eyes. As &s;oon as &s;he could &s;peak, &s;he inquired "if &s;he was &s;till in Oakendale Abbey?"</P>
<P>"No," &s;aid the woman; "you are in my cot|tage, and I have been fearfully frightened le&s;t you were dead."</P>
<P>"Thank God," &s;aid Laura, "I am once more with a human being; and pray tell me by what, or who&s;e means I came here?"</P>
<P>"Lawkaday!" &s;aid the woman; "I knows no more than you do: Chri&s;tian charity made me take you in, when two men brought you here to be recovered. They a&s;&s;ured me you was not dead, and would be better in a &s;hort time; I was

loth to tru&s;t them, and now I'm afraid I &s;hall get into trouble; for I thinks you be the &s;ame Lady that has lived &s;o long with the &s;pirits in the Ab|bey."</P>
<P>"Whatever I am," &s;aid Laura, "I entreat you to tell me how far I am from that hateful Ab|bey, and if there is a road leads to it from the little wood?"</P>
<P>"Aye, &s;ure there is," &s;aid the woman, "and it is hard by. Laws! I don't wonder you have been almo&s;t frightened to death, if you have been in that &s;hocking place; why, nobody before ever ventured to &s;tay there."</P>
<P>Laura felt her&s;elf extremely weak, and begged the woman to give her &s;ome water. She brought her other refre&s;hments; and, after &s;he was a little revived, her thanks were mo&s;t devoutly and a|bundantly offered to Providence, not only for her pre&s;ervation from danger, but al&s;o for enab|ling her to pre&s;erve her &s;en&s;es under circum&s;tan|ces &s;o truly frightful, and &s;ufficiently calculated to deprive her of them. She enjoined &s;ecrecy to the woman on the &s;ubject of her having been in the Abbey, as well as of her having been now under her roof. She felt her mind more ea&s;y on
<PB N="63" REF="035640_0062_100693429983F3B0">
the woman's a&s;&s;uring her, &s;he her&s;elf &s;hould be afraid to have it known that &s;he was there, be|cau&s;e my Lord was a powerful rich man; and yet &s;he &s;hould never forgive her&s;elf to be the cau&s;e of &s;ending a fellow-creature to the Abbey, which was not fit for chri&s;tian folks to live in.</P>
<P>The morning was now far advanced, and Lau|ra thought it would be be&s;t to wait the return of the evening before &s;he again attempted her e&s;|cape. She likewi&s;e found her&s;elf too much en|feebled, and too low, from the &s;ufferings of her &s;pirits, to begin another enterpri&s;e till they were, in &s;ome degree, recruited; &s;he therefore compo&s;|ed her&s;elf, as well as her &s;ituation would admit of, till the evening; although &s;he by no means thought her&s;elf &s;afe &s;o near the Abbey, and no|thing but her inability would have prevented her from quitting the cottage immediately. In the evening &s;he found her&s;elf tolerably refre&s;hed, and her de&s;ire to e&s;cape, aiding her re&s;olution, &s;he re|warded the old woman; at the &s;ame time en|treating her to be &s;ecret, and, with amazing for|titude (con&s;idering what &s;he had &s;uffered) &s;et forward on her &s;econd expedition.</P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="035640_0063_10069345F3587C48">
She &s;aw the Abbey at a &s;mall di&s;tance on her left; and she was determined to take &s;uch a di|rection, as to &s;teer clear of again encountering &s;o frightful an abode.</P>
<P>Behold her then once more endeavouring to gain an a&s;ylum from tyrannic power and &s;uperna|tural terror. Truth and innocence guided her &s;teps, and con&s;cious virtue shielded her from cow|ardice. The rays of the evening &s;un, shone up|on her beauty, and she followed the fir&s;t path to her right, which led her along a fine valley. The air revived her &s;pirits; she walked very fa&s;t, without &s;eeing either village or hou&s;e of any &s;ort. The evening began to clo&s;e in, and every mo|ment &s;eemed to thicken the atmo&s;phere. She feared she should be obliged to &s;ome tree or hedge to shelter her from the approaching dews of the night; yet she did not repent her enterpri&s;e; on the contrary, she was thankful that fortune had thus favoured her e&s;cape, and that she was in a country where she had nothing to fear from wild bea&s;ts, and she could meet with nothing more ter|rific than she had encountered the preceding night. With reflections like the&s;e she continued her walk, and ca&s;ting her eyes round to find &s;ome &s;preading tree, or sheltering bush, under which
<PB N="65" REF="035640_0064_1006934958136FD8">
to re&s;t, she &s;pied a few &s;cattered cottages almo&s;t concealed under the &s;ide of a hill; her &s;peed re|doubled, and she &s;oon found her&s;elf within &s;ight of the hamlet. A girl, about twelve years old, dre&s;&s;ed in a coar&s;e blue woollen jacket, without either shoes or &s;tockings, who walked at &s;ome di&s;tance before her, and a parcel of gee&s;e, which came &s;tretching their necks and hi&s;&s;ing at her, were the only objects she &s;aw.</P>
<P>The girl turned into a cottage, and Laura cou|rageou&s;ly followed her; an elderly woman &s;at near the chimney carding &s;ome wool, and the cot|tage, though clean, had every appearance of ex|treme poverty. The woman &s;tarted at the ap|pearance of Laura, who&s;e dre&s;s and deportment were &s;uperior to what she was generally accu&s;|tomed to &s;ee; and throwing a&s;ide her work, and dropping a courte&s;y, she a&s;ked her "if she was come from the Grove, and what she was plea&s;ed to want."</P>
<P>Laura, with a &s;weetne&s;s peculiar to her&s;elf, re|plied, "that she wanted nothing but shelter for the night; and if she would have the goodne&s;s to allow her to &s;it in that room till the next morning dawned, she would in no way incommode her."</P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="035640_0065_1006934AEB7ABCC0">
"Lawkaday!" &s;aid the woman, "you might &s;leep with our Mary-Ann for the matter o'that; but if &s;o be, as you have lo&s;t your friends, or mi&s;&s;ed your way you'd better go up to the Grove; ould Madam has a power of money, and is main good to &s;trangers. When John comes home from work he'll go and &s;hew you the way."</P>
<P>Laura thanked her, but &s;aid, "&s;he had rather &s;tay where &s;he was, at lea&s;t for this night, and perhaps &s;he might get them to &s;hew her the way to the Grove in the morning."</P>
<P>During this time Mary-Ann had given the a|larm to the little republic, and &s;everal ragged children were gathered round the door. The good woman &s;oon di&s;per&s;ed them, and telling her daughter to bring in &s;ome fire-wood, &s;he &s;et a|bout making a cheerful blaze, which gave her cottage &s;uch an appearance of comfort, as a more &s;plendid apartment &s;eldom exhibits:
<Q><L>The cricket chirrups in the hearth;</L>
<L>The crackling faggot flies.</L></Q></P>
<P>Laura felt her&s;elf plea&s;ed, and &s;afe, which brightened every object before her; and &s;he was contemplating the &s;implicity of the whole, when a rough-looking, hard-featured man, who was
<PB N="67" REF="035640_0066_1006935090E64B40">
the owner of the cottage, made his appearance. His wife &s;aid to him, "Ma&s;ter, here is a gentle|woman comed to &s;tay all night with us; but I'd fain per&s;uade her to go up to Madams."</P>
<P>John &s;tared at Laura, but &s;aid nothing; when &s;he ventured to a&s;k him, how far they were from Oakendale?</P>
<P>"Nine miles," &s;aid John; "and I would no go there at this time o'night for all you could give me."</P>
<P>"Nor I neither," thought Laura to her&s;elf, &s;urpri&s;ed that &s;he had walked &s;o far.</P>
<P>"No," &s;aid the wife, "that is a fearful place by all account; &s;uch frightful &s;ights ha been &s;een there, as makes a body &s;hake but to think on; and bloody murders ha been committed there former|ly no doubt!"</P>
<P>If Laura was &s;atisfied and plea&s;ed with her ho&s;t and ho&s;te&s;s, they were not le&s;s &s;o with her gentle manners and obliging behavior; and entertained no &s;u&s;picion to the di&s;advantage of their gue&s;t, whom they pre&s;&s;ed to partake of the be&s;t they had to produce; and &s;he joyfully &s;hared the coar&s;e, but clean, bed of Mary Ann.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="035640_0067_10069352586E70B8">
The next morning, not knowing where to bend her cour&s;e, and thinking &s;he &s;hould be more &s;ecure from Lord Oakendale's &s;earch, &s;hould he be di&s;po&s;ed to make any after her, under &s;ome &s;afe protection, &s;he li&s;tened to the advice of the cottagers, and begged they would conduct her to the Grove, where re&s;ided the good lady of whom they had &s;poken &s;o highly, and who&s;e name was Greville. The Grove was &s;ituated about a mile from the cottage, and the towers of an antient &s;tructure peeped from between the lofty elms and oaks that encompa&s;&s;ed its &s;tructure, and gave it its name.</P>
<P>As they approached the man&s;ion, Laura rumi|nated on the mode of introducing her&s;elf to the lady of the hou&s;e, and could devi&s;e no better than by declaring the truth, and entreating her protection, which from the cottager's reports &s;he was encouraged to hope would not be denied her.</P>
<P>When they arrived at the hou&s;e they were re|ceived by the hou&s;e-keeper, a comely looking woman, about fifty years of age, dre&s;&s;ed in a plain old fa&s;hion &s;tyle, with a bunch of keys by her &s;ide. When Laura reque&s;ted to be introduced to Mrs.
<PB N="69" REF="035640_0068_1006935587B4EE50">
Greville, the hou&s;e-keeper <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> who &s;he was to name?</P>
<P>Laura blu&s;hed, and a tear &s;tarted into her eyes upon the recollection that &s;he knew no name to which &s;he had any ju&s;t claim; and, with a &s;igh returned. "I have been taught to believe that the name of Unfortunate will introduce me to your lady, and &s;ecure me a favorable reception."</P>
<P>The hou&s;e-keeper, glancing an eye of pity on her, led the way, and introduced her to Mrs Greville, a venerable old lady, who, taking off her &s;pectacles, politely &s;aid, "I have not the ho|nor of knowing you, young lady; but that, I dare &s;ay, is owing to the defect of my &s;ight and memory."</P>
<P>"Alas! no," replied Laura; but here her for|lorn &s;ituation recurring to her mind too forcibly to be &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, &s;he again bur&s;t into tears. Per|haps this was the be&s;t introduction &s;he could have cho&s;en, as a pa&s;&s;port to the tender heart of Mrs. Greville. She looked at Laura with the eyes of pity, and taking her by the hand, &s;aid, in the kinde&s;t accents, "Sit down, young lady, and compo&s;e your&s;elf; you &s;eem fatigued, and &s;hall take &s;ome refre&s;hment before you gratify a curi|o&s;ity,

which is, I own, &s;trongly excited, and be a&s;&s;ured, prejudiced in your favor.'</P>
<P>Saying this, &s;he di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the hou&s;e-keeper for &s;ome chocolate; and, in the mean time, Laura &s;o far recovered her&s;elf as to &s;ay, "Dear Madam, you &s;ee before you a forlorn creature thrown up|on the world, without country, friends, or for|tune, to protect me; not even a relation from whom I can claim either name or affinity!"</P>
<P>"Then," &s;aid Mrs. Greville, "&s;urely you are the more entitled to the protection of &s;trangers."</P>
<P>Laura thanked her by the mo&s;t grateful ac|knowledgements; and, having drank her choco|late, began the following hi&s;tory of her&s;elf:</P>
<P>"My infant remembrance," &s;aid &s;he, "fur|ni&s;hes me with ideas of a country different from this. A gentleman, care&s;&s;ing me, in &s;carlet clothes, with a &s;a&s;h and gorget, and other glitter|ing appendages, dazzled my young &s;ight, and made an impre&s;&s;ion on my memory like a di&s;tant dream. I can recollect a beautiful woman &s;natch|ing me to her arms when the gentleman was gone; and, as &s;he ki&s;&s;ed me, the tears fell from her eyes in drops upon my frock. I remember too that I
<PB N="71" REF="035640_0070_1006935CF6A5AB78">
was called Laura. The next circum&s;tance that dwelt upon my recollection, was that of &s;itting upon the lap of a black woman, who told me I &s;hould &s;ee my papa and mama no more; that I mu&s;t be very good, and &s;he would love me. She taught me my prayers, and the meaning of words; but &s;he omited to tell me my name. She treated me with great tenderne&s;s, and I conceived an af|fection for her. Soon after &s;he put me on board a &s;hip with &s;everal people of my own color; and, after hugging and embracing me with great af|fection, &s;he left me. I cried after her as the only being of whom I had any knowledge, and I could not ea&s;ily be reconciled to any other. The motion of the ve&s;&s;el fir&s;t made me &s;ick, and then lolled me to &s;leep. When I awoke I cried again; but was &s;oothed by &s;ome women on board, and told that I was going to &s;ee my relations. I &s;oon grew accu&s;tomed to the &s;hip, and to the people about me, although I was too young to under|&s;tand any of their conver&s;ation, or know whither we were going. As far as my early age, and di&s;|tance of time, would allow me to judge, we were &s;ome months at &s;ea; when one morning I was frightened by a confu&s;ed noi&s;e, which was follow|ed
<PB N="72" REF="035640_0071_1006936059ECAC48">
by a continued firing of cannon. The whole &s;hip's crew &s;eemed in alarm, and I was huddled with the re&s;t of the women, into a dark part of the ve&s;&s;el, which I had never &s;een before. Eve|ry one &s;eemed terrified, and felt the contagion of fear, though I knew not what we had to dread. In a &s;hort time a number of men, who &s;poke in a different language to that I had been u&s;ed to, and were almo&s;t without clothes, ru&s;hed into the place where we were confined and began to drag the women about, in who&s;e &s;creams and cries I joined: All appeared in confu&s;ion, when two or three better dre&s;&s;ed men came, and, &s;peaking in a commanding tone, there &s;eemed to be more re|regulation ob&s;erved; but they did not trouble them&s;elves with me, except to &s;hut me in with the re&s;t.</P>
<P>"Previous to this ceremony, and upon hearing a &s;hout, in what I afterwards knew to be the French language, one of the women took a &s;eal|ed packet from a trunk, which &s;he &s;aid belonged to me, and with a &s;tring fa&s;tened it round my bo|dy, telling me (for I &s;hall remember her words) that was the only te&s;timony of my name and pa|rentage; adding, that I mu&s;t never let any body take it from me. Her intention was no doubt
<PB N="73" REF="035640_0072_10069363EB4BA228">
good; but &s;he would no doubt have done better to have taught me my name, and &s;o impre&s;&s;ed it on my memory, that I might not now have been the de&s;titute and forlorn creature I feel my&s;elf; but I was then too young to ob&s;erve the omi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>"Soon after this we arrived, as I &s;uppo&s;ed, at our de&s;tined port, where we were dragged out of the ve&s;&s;el, and put into waggons; when, after a tedious journey of &s;everal days, during which I &s;uffered cold and hunger to the extreme; we were at length brought to a large city, which I heard was Paris. If I was before wretched, though at that time I felt the &s;en&s;ation without knowing by what name to de&s;cribe it, how much was my mi&s;|ery increa&s;ed when we were all crammed into a French pri&s;on!</P>
<P>"On my fir&s;t being taken out of the waggon, a tall frightful man, with a wide mouth, held me in his arms, and made a motion as if he would eat me! I was terrified, and cried; but no cries were regarded, and we were hurried into the pri|&s;on, which contained &s;ome hundreds of wretches like our&s;elves. My clothes and linen were of a finer texture than tho&s;e of my companions; I was
<PB N="74" REF="035640_0073_10069367450DAF98">
therefore, regardle&s;s of my cries, &s;tripped, and clad in a very coar&s;e and filthy garb. I held the paper, which was tied round me, fa&s;t with my little hands; but I was brutally forced to relin|qui&s;h my hold, and it was wantonly torn from me. After this I remembered nothing for many days; I turned my head this way, and that way, to a|void the &s;tench of the pri&s;on; but could in no di|rection find a whole&s;ome air. When I recover|ed, from what I &s;uppo&s;e was a fever and deliri|um, I found my&s;elf &s;tretched upon a wretched bed with &s;everal others, and &s;ome of the dead bodies were removing to their la&s;t abode. I un|der&s;tood none of the language, and my fir&s;t wi&s;h was for fre&s;h air. As I was lying in this mi&s;era|ble condition, a gentleman entered the room, who&s;e countenance and appearance was different from any I had &s;een before. He felt the pul&s;e of &s;ome of them, and &s;poke the language I under|&s;tood. I wi&s;hed to attract his notice, and my eyes followed his countenance whither&s;oever it turned. At la&s;t he approached the bed on which I was laid, and coming to the &s;ide of it, examin|ed my features with attention.</P>
<P>"I longed to &s;peak to him; but I had &s;carce &s;trength, and &s;till le&s;s courage to make &s;uch an

effort; but when he took my burning emaciated hand in his I ventured to cla&s;p his fingers whil&s;t the tears &s;treamed from my eyes.</P>
<P>"He tenderly returned the pre&s;&s;ure, &s;aying, "Poor child, to whom do&s;t thou belong? and what is thy name?"</P>
<P>"I faintly an&s;wered, Laura; and I am very &s;ick. He gave me &s;omething which he poured out of a bottle, and which &s;eemed of a reviving quality; and when the per&s;on, who attended the room three or four times a day, and locked us up, came in, he conferred with him &s;everal minutes in the French language, frequently pointing to me as he &s;poke.</P>
<P>"The next morning an old woman, whom I had before &s;een bu&s;y about the bodies of tho&s;e that died in the room, came and took me from the bed, wa&s;hed me, and put upon me &s;ome coar&s;e but clean linen, led me out into the air, and gave me &s;ome better refre&s;hment than I had lately ta&s;ted. I was then put into a coach in which &s;at the gentleman I had &s;een the day before. He &s;poke to me in the kinde&s;t accents, and I en|deavoured to &s;hew my gratitude by a thou&s;and childi&s;h endeavours.</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="035640_0075_1006936E6D264210">
"When the coach &s;topped, I was led by my benefactor into a hand&s;ome room, where &s;at a lady of a mo&s;t benign countenance: "This my dear," &s;aid the gentleman, leading me to her, "is the poor child of whom I &s;poke ye&s;terday, and whom you have &s;o kindly con&s;ented to re|ceive; &s;he has been very ill and is weak at pre|&s;ent; but I am &s;ure &s;he has a greatful heart."</P>
<P>"I paid my re&s;pects to the lady in the be&s;t manner I was able; and &s;he &s;aid, "Poor thing, &s;he &s;hall be taken care of; and I think &s;he looks like a gentleman's child." I felt my heart glow with plea&s;ure at this ob&s;ervation; and I will con|fe&s;s, that it gave me more delight than all the ca|re&s;&s;es they be&s;towed.</P>
<P>"In a few days I was &s;till better habited; and I told my benefactors, who&s;e names were du Frene, all that I knew and could remember of my hi&s;tory. They had no children, and they conceived a parental regard for me, which I re|turned by the mo&s;t filial affection. They were French; but he was of Engli&s;h extraction, and both were Prote&s;tants. He had re&s;ided many years in Paris, where he practi&s;ed &s;urgery, and had been in high repute in that profe&s;&s;ion, and
<PB N="77" REF="035640_0076_1006937284ABD4D0">
which he now followed from motives of humani|ty rather than from lucrative ones, as he was in very good circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>"My dear Madame du Frene was the only mother I had ever known. She grew every day more fond of me. She had me taught every nece&s;&s;ary accompli&s;hment, as well as every u&s;eful employment; and the principles of religion and virtue, which &s;he practi&s;ed in their fulle&s;t ex|tent, &s;he in&s;tilled into my mind as the brighte&s;t ornaments I could po&s;&s;e&s;s.&mdash;Indeed, they appear|ed with &s;uch lu&s;tre, from her bright example, that I wanted no incitements to be at lea&s;t an humble imitator of her many virtues. Were I to dwell upon all her excellencies, my &s;tory would not &s;oon come to a conclu&s;ion. Nor had Mon&s;. du Frene le&s;s merit; I know not which of them &s;hewed me mo&s;t fondne&s;s; and when I grew up, their tender care of me, as a child, was changed into unremitting anxiety and &s;olicitude. When I was addre&s;&s;ed by the appellation of Mademoi|&s;elle du Frene, their eyes &s;parkled with plea&s;ure; and this was often the ca&s;e, for I knew no other name; and after all the enquiries M. du Frene could make, concerning the parcel which was
<PB N="78" REF="035640_0077_100693763538A628">
fa&s;tened to my brea&s;t on my entrance into the pri&s;on, no di&s;covery could po&s;&s;ibly be made re|lating to it; for which rea&s;on it was natural to &s;uppo&s;e that it contained &s;omething valuable&mdash;be&s;ides the identy of my birth and name, which alone we &s;hould have no difficulty in recovering.&mdash;Whenever I expre&s;&s;ed unea&s;ine&s;s at the circum|&s;tances of not knowing to whom I owed my be|ing, with what enraptured fondne&s;s would the&s;e dear parents call me their adopted child, and a&s;|&s;ure me that I &s;hould never feel the want of &s;uch endearing ties! I hope I returned their affection by the mo&s;t filial love and duty; but youth is giddy, and we never know the value of a ble&s;|&s;ing till it is no longer in our power to &s;et a ju&s;t e&s;timate upon it. Ten years endeared me to this kind protection, upon which I look back with delight. I learned to &s;peak the language fluent|ly, though Engli&s;h was as much &s;poken in M. du Frene's family as French. No expence was &s;pared on my education, dre&s;s, or amu&s;ement, and I moved in a circle far above the &s;phere of life in which M. du Frene was placed; but it was their pride to have me introduced, and &s;ee me care&s;&s;ed by people of rank; and M. du Frene
<PB N="79" REF="035640_0078_100693783696C6F8">
was well received by the&s;e per&s;ons on account of his extraordinary merit.</P>
<P>"It was in the mid&s;t of the&s;e happy days, when M. du Frene received letters from his bro|ther in England, who was in the &s;ame profe&s;&s;ion, appri&s;ing him of the arrival of a young gentle|man, of the name of Rayneer, who was &s;ent to be under his care, in order to be made a profici|ent in the language, and to complete his education.</P>
<P>"I was in the habit of hearing fine things from the beaux who fluttered round me in pub|lic places, and &s;ometimes di&s;tingui&s;hed a man of &s;en&s;e and good breeding from the empty coxcomb and the licentious rake; but none had made an impre&s;&s;ion beyond the moment in which they ad|dre&s;&s;ed me, and my heart had never as yet palpi|tated in favor of one man more than another; but the time was now approaching when I could no longer make this boa&s;t. Eugene Rayneer ar|rived; his figure, his voice, his manner, all were captivating in the extreme. He did not live un|der the &s;ame roof with me; but he had lodgings near us, and there were but few hours out of the twenty-four in which we were not together. Ah! how dangerous it is to throw into each
<PB N="80" REF="035640_0079_1006937BF7B031F0">
other's company two young people nearly of an age, and between who&s;e di&s;po&s;itions a &s;imilarity of &s;entiments cannot fail to form attachment!&mdash;What plea&s;ant hours did we pa&s;s together! But I will not, dear Madam, tire you with a repetition of our love, the remembrance of which is painful becau&s;e it is pa&s;t. Suffice it to &s;ay, that we ex|changed mutual vows without con&s;idering the im|probability there was of our ever being united. He &s;eemed to know but little of his family, and &s;till le&s;s of his fortune: but nature had been abun|dantly lavi&s;h of her favors, and his own endea|vors had not been wanting to render him a mo&s;t accompli&s;hed young man. His temper was ge|nerous and good, but rather inclined to be impe|tuous. My dear M. du Frene u&s;ed frequently to lament that he had not &s;ufficient authority over him to keep him from errors occa&s;ioned by this di&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P>"One day that we were at dinner M. du Frene was &s;uddenly, and with an air of my&s;tery, called out. He in&s;tantly obeyed the &s;ummons, and did not return for &s;ome time. I knew not what pa&s;|&s;ed in the mind of Madame; but my own heart foreboded a thou&s;and fearful images during an hour's ab&s;ence of M. du Frene, At his return
<PB N="81" REF="035640_0080_1006937F5A202BE0">
we both expre&s;&s;ed curio&s;ity at the face of anxiety&punc; with which he appeared: and, after a few mo|ment's &s;ilence, he &s;aid, "That fooli&s;h boy Eu|gene, has engaged in a di&s;agreeable adventure, and has got an ugly wound in the recontre."</P>
<P>"At the mention of a wound I felt my blood ru&s;h into my face, and a violent beating of my heart &s;ucceeded. He went on by &s;aying, "He hoped there was no danger in the wound; but he under&s;tood it was the con&s;equence of a challenge given by Eugene to a per&s;on of con&s;equence, who was likewi&s;e wounded, and who&s;e friends he feared would not ea&s;ily be appea&s;ed." What terror did the&s;e words convey to my already oppre&s;&s;ed mind! Several days pa&s;&s;ed in this cruel uncertainty. Madame du Frene frequently vi&s;it|ed Eugene; but &s;he always returned with a me|lancholy countenance, and I had &s;carce ever cou|rage to a&s;k her any que&s;tions.</P>
<P>"One day &s;he returned with cheerful looks, and mine caught the plea&s;ing &s;ympathy. She put out her hand to me, and &s;aid, "My dear Laura, I can now congratulate you on the complete reco|very of Eugene. At the &s;ame time I will inform
<PB N="82" REF="035640_0081_10069380F0E165B0">
you, that you have been the cau&s;e of a wound which had nearly been fatal.</P>
<P>"How, my dear Madame," I replied, "can I have been the cau&s;e of &s;uch an accident? and, if I have, how ought I to rejoice that the danger is over?"</P>
<P>"Sit down, my love," &s;aid Madame; "be compo&s;ed, and I will tell you the whole. Eugene was playing at billiards with the young marquis of&mdash;, only &s;on of the Duke de St.&mdash;. They had played &s;everal games, and the marquis, hav|ing been &s;ucce&s;sful, was very de&s;irous that Eugene &s;hould win &s;ome of the games back again; but Eugene wanted to be with you, he grew impa|tient, and uttering &s;ome ha&s;ty words, the mar|quis replied, "Oh! you want to be with that little Bourjeoi&s;e, the &s;urgeon's daughter; ah! &s;he is a tempting little creature; but &s;he may wait till our games are more evenly decided."</P>
<P>"Eugene heard no more. He in&s;tantly gave the challenge, and they as in&s;tantly ran each other through the body. Both fell at the &s;ame moment, and would have both died from lo&s;s of blood, had not one of the waiters fortu|nately di&s;covered them. It would be impo&s;&s;ible
<PB N="83" REF="035640_0082_10069384317FEFA0">
to &s;ay which of their wounds was mo&s;t danger|ous. The &s;ymptoms of the marquis were mo&s;t favorable, becau&s;e his mind was not &s;o agitated as Eugene's; neverthele&s;s they were both extreme|ly dangerous, and the Duke of&mdash;would have &s;hewn no favor to his &s;on's antagoni&s;t had he lo&s;t him. Thank God they are now in a fair way of recovery, and both have exchanged forgive|ne&s;s; and till this favourable event, M. du Frene and my&s;elf have pre&s;erved a &s;trange and unplea|&s;ant &s;ilence towards you; but, unle&s;s we could give you more favorable accounts, we were de|termined to keep you in ignorance. But now, that every thing is in &s;o pro&s;perous a train, we would have you partake in the general joy."</P>
<P>"I thanked my dear Madame, by the mo&s;t grateful acknowledgements, for all her kind|ne&s;s; and my heart overflowed with prai&s;e and thak&s;giving for my Eugene's recovery. I long|ed to &s;ee him, but I had not courage to make the reque&s;t. Madame du Frene anticipated my wi&s;hes, and &s;aid, "There can, I think, be no impropriety in your going with me to &s;ee Eu|gene; I know the &s;ight of you will complete his cure."</P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="035640_0083_100693879BEB7218">
"I wanted no intreaty to pay a vi&s;it in which my heart was &s;o much intere&s;ted; and I had the plea&s;ure of finding Eugene perfectly well, except weakne&s;s. To me he never looked or &s;poke in a more captivating manner. In a few days he walked out; our interviews were more frequent than ever, and I fooli&s;hly thought that all mis|fortune was comprehended in the illne&s;s of Eu|gene; and now, that he was well and again re&s;|tored to me, I had nothing but happine&s;s before me. Alas! how little do we know how fortune varies her favors, and di&s;pen&s;es a chequered &s;cene to mo&s;t mortals.&mdash;I could not dive&s;t my&s;elf of extreme partiality for Eugene, and found a plea|&s;ure in his company, which I had never experi|enced from the frivolity of a Frenchman; and when the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible remarks, and the tender|e&s;t attentions, were received from a man who&s;e external appearance be&s;poke the nobler qualities of his mind, my heart gave the true&s;t te&s;timony to his merits; nor did I affect to di&s;own them to my dear Madame du Frene; to her I had confi|ded all my grief, and all my joy. She would allow me to expatiate on the merits of my be|loved Eugene with all the glow of affection which warmed my brea&s;t; &s;he loved me too tenderly to
<PB N="85" REF="035640_0084_1006938D0D4A5418">
check the fond effu&s;ions which afforded me &s;o much delight; and when I fancied that I was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of his affections, nothing I thought, could interrupt my happine&s;s, or rever&s;e my for|tune:&mdash;She would only in&s;inuate in the gentle&s;t accents, and with the mo&s;t per&s;ua&s;ive arguments, that I mu&s;t not expect complete happine&s;s; that all our lives were liable to the caprice of fortune, and who&s;e changes human nature was born to encounter, and mu&s;t &s;ubmit.&mdash;Perfect bli&s;s was the lot of none, nor was even a large portion of happine&s;s po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by many; &s;he would there|fore wi&s;h to prepare my mind, and make it equal to meet the di&s;pen&s;ations of all human events, that &s;o I might &s;ecure that peace, which the world can neither give nor take away.</P>
<P>"Thus was I, by her dear precepts, in &s;ome degree fitted for tho&s;e many difficulties and dan|gers I have already encountered; and to her, next to God Almighty, I am indebted for this fortitude which has hitherto &s;u&s;tained me." But to return to my &s;tory.</P>
<P>"One morning Eugene &s;hewed me a letter he had received, which recalled him to England. He &s;aid it came from a gentleman who was his
<PB N="86" REF="035640_0085_1006938E9F8411C8">
guardian, and whom he was bound to obey. There were &s;ome &s;entences in the letter, which were couched in &s;uch terms as led us both to think, that when the writer talked of forming improper connexions, by remaining too long in one place, he alluded to our intimacy.</P>
<P>"Eugene at fir&s;t declared he would not obey the mandate, and that he had long enough &s;ub|mitted to the controul and caprice of tho&s;e whom he really believed had no right to direct, or take any part in his conduct. As to my&s;elf, I was to|tally incapable of giving advice; but there was no occa&s;ion; M. du Frene decided for us. He al&s;o had received a letter on the &s;ame &s;ubject, and Eugene's fate was determined. If ever there was a moment in which my love for M. du Frene was abated, it was when he peremptorily told him he mu&s;t not delay his departure. I felt as if I had received a blow, which deprived me of all my faculties; nor could all the a&s;&s;urances of Eugene's faith and everla&s;ting love reconcile me to the idea of lo&s;ing him. I con&s;idered his departure as the deprivation of all my happine&s;s; nor could all the admonitions of Madame calm my feelings. Indeed tho&s;e dear parents lamented his lo&s;s almo&s;t as much as my&s;elf; and when the day arrived on
<PB N="87" REF="035640_0086_10069391EF520F38">
which he was to take his leave, I &s;carce knew which of us were mo&s;t concerned.</P>
<P>"M. du Frene pre&s;&s;ed him to his heart, and conjured him never to forget friends to whom he was &s;o dear; and Madame &s;aid a thou&s;and kind and affectionate things to him. As to my&s;elf, I &s;tood like the picture of de&s;pair; and when Eu|gene pre&s;&s;ed me to his bo&s;om, I felt as if my whole exi&s;tence was at an end, and I could not articu|late a &s;entence. Ah! too ju&s;t was my pre&s;enti|ment that we &s;hould never meet again. He pro|mi&s;ed to write, and (if po&s;&s;ible) to return; but never, from that &s;ad hour, did we hear or &s;ee any more of him; and from that time happine&s;s &s;eemed to have fled with my lo&s;t Eugene.</P>
<P>"M. du Frene was a politician. What grief did that circum&s;tance occa&s;ion to Madame! We u&s;ed all our per&s;ua&s;ions to keep him at home, and to take no part in the broils which began to be very general; but it was to no purpo&s;e that we urged him to be neuter; He was too much attach|ed to his king to bear quietly the di&s;affection which prevailed, and every where began to &s;pread it&s;elf. All our entreaties were u&s;ed in vain; a whole year pa&s;&s;ed in this unplea&s;ant &s;tate, and no
<PB N="88" REF="035640_0087_100693952D48D1B8">
intelligence of Eugene arrived to &s;ooth the tedi|ous hours, rendered &s;till more irk&s;ome by M. du Frene's frequent quarrels and unea&s;ine&s;s, by the melancholy which always pervaded his counte|nance, and the continual dread we were under of &s;ome new calamity happening to the &s;tate.</P>
<P>"In this di&s;tre&s;&s;ed condition we continued till the fatal tenth of Augu&s;t, 1792; that era of ever|la&s;ting di&s;grace to the French nation, when Paris was deluged in human gore. On that &s;ad day M. du Frene had gone from home early in the morning, and I had been vainly endeavoring to per&s;uade Madame du Frene that her fears were needle&s;s, when a loud knocking at the door, and a tumult, made me venture to look through the window; when ah! how does my &s;oul &s;icken at the remembrance! I &s;aw my ever dear, my more than parent's head, &s;tuck upon a pike, reeking and clotted with blood! I uttered a &s;cream, and hid my eyes with my hands; when Madame du Frene coming to my a&s;&s;i&s;tance, di&s;covered the dreadful object which had occa&s;ioned my terror! She gave a piercing &s;cream, which, methinks, now vibrates on my ear, and dropped &s;en&s;ele&s;s on the floor.</P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="035640_0088_1006939A9AEAF9D8">
"Greatly as I was affected, I exerted my&s;elf to a&s;&s;i&s;t and recal her to life, which it was &s;ome time before &s;he &s;hewed any &s;igns of. When &s;he, in &s;ome degree, recovered, &s;he ob&s;erved a pro|found &s;ilence upon the &s;ubject of the horrible &s;ight we had both of us but too plainly &s;een. Her &s;ighs, indeed, were deep and bitter; but it &s;eemed as if &s;he could not bear to name the &s;hock|ing circum&s;tance which occa&s;ioned them, and to which &s;he mu&s;t have been witne&s;s. We had &s;carce time to recollect our&s;elves, and my dear Madame du Frene &s;hewed but little &s;igns of ani|mation, when &s;ome of our friends a&s;&s;embled at our hou&s;e, and earne&s;tly entreated we would lo&s;e no time in making our e&s;cape, if we wi&s;hed to avoid the cruel fate which &s;ome of tho&s;e deare&s;t to us had experienced. We neither of us &s;eemed &s;uf|ficiently intere&s;ted to prolong our wretchedne&s;s, or attend to their remon&s;trances, and we appear|ed rather to wi&s;h for death than to avoid it; but our friends u&s;ed &s;uch pre&s;&s;ing &s;olicitations, and begged &s;o earne&s;tly, that we would leave Paris with them, that we began (though reluctantly) to put up our valuables, and to prepare for our de|parture. Little as I cared for life, or had any

pro&s;pect to invite its continuance, yet the name of England &s;ounded with a &s;weet &s;en&s;ation. A thou&s;and tender ideas were a&s;&s;ociated with that country; and the fond remembrance of Eugene played round my heart amid&s;t the &s;orrows that encompa&s;&s;ed me. I joined my endeavors to rou&s;e Madame du Frene from her lethargy of woe, and to fly whil&s;t it was yet in our power; and having &s;ucceeded, we left Paris that night, and travelled with as much expedition as the French carriages could make, till we got to Boulogne, where we found the town crowded with emigrants, waiting to cro&s;s the water.</P>
<P>"When the wind was fair, and the ve&s;&s;els were ready, we were hurried down to the quay in &s;uch numbers, and put on board in &s;o much confu&s;ion, that I was unfortunately &s;eparated from my dear Madame du Frene, and put on board of a merchantman.</P>
<P>"As &s;oon as I found my&s;elf &s;eparated from her, I entreated, and offered largely to the captain if he would &s;et me on &s;hore again; but he was deaf to all my cries, and &s;aid he would not lo&s;e a mo|ment. My mi&s;ery was not to be de&s;cribed! I found my&s;elf encompa&s;&s;ed by &s;trangers; and

what was wor&s;e, I under&s;tood we were to be &s;et on &s;hore on the Welch coa&s;t.</P>
<P>"As to the fate of Madame du Frene, from that hour to this, I have remained in total igno|rance about it; and it has been an everla&s;ting cau&s;e of &s;orrow to me!</P>
<P>"We landed in Milford Haven, at a place which appeared almo&s;t uninhabited; and con&s;i&s;t|ed only of an inn and a few hou&s;es. It might be con&s;idered as a bathing place, but of little re&s;ort. I fixed my re&s;idence in a &s;mall lodging near the &s;ea, to which my eyes were ince&s;&s;antly turned, in the hope of &s;eeing &s;ome ve&s;&s;el which might bring Madame du Frene to the &s;ame &s;pot.</P>
<P>"Mo&s;t of the people who landed with me, di&s;per&s;ed to different parts of England; but as I could think of no place to prefer to this, I thought it be&s;t, for the pre&s;ent, to remain where I was. I was attended by a young woman of the village, named Mary Morgan; &s;he was neat, and well behaved; and I pa&s;&s;ed mo&s;t of my time in wan|dering with her on the beach. I wi&s;hed to go to London, as the mo&s;t likely place to hear of Ma|dame du Frene; but I was afraid to go there
<PB N="92" REF="035640_0091_100693A314AFC2D8">
alone, there not being in that va&s;t metropolis one per&s;on with whom I could claim acquaintance.</P>
<P>"It happened one evening that, as I was walk|ing upon the beach with Mary, I perceived my|&s;elf ob&s;erved by a good looking man, who ap|peared to be about forty years of age, and who &s;eemed to eye me with uncommon attention. There was &s;omething in his per&s;on and manners, which not only attracted my notice, but al&s;o my partiality. Our eyes met; and, as I was &s;tand|ing &s;till on the beach, I was not di&s;plea&s;ed at be|ing acco&s;ted by him with &s;ome general ob&s;erva|tions upon the place we were in, and the &s;ea pro&s;|pect, &amp;c.</P>
<P>"The next day we met upon the &s;ame &s;pot, when our conver&s;ation was again renewed. We talked on various &s;ubjects, and he told me his name was Thoranby; that he lived in London, and generally came every &s;ummer to &s;ome place of this kind for the benefit of &s;ea-bathing, and to be retired.</P>
<P>"Upon his &s;aying that he lived in London, I imprudently replied, "That of all places I wi&s;h|ed to go there;" at the &s;ame time telling him that part of my hi&s;tory which had &s;eparated me
<PB N="93" REF="035640_0092_100693A4EDDAD888">
from my more than mother, and my ardent wi&s;h to find her again.</P>
<P>"He &s;eemed plea&s;ed with the affectionate duty I expre&s;&s;ed; and, after paying me &s;ome compli|ments on my extreme &s;en&s;ibility, he &s;aid, "He had a &s;i&s;ter in London, who would, he was &s;ure, be happy to receive me; and would unite her en|deavors to mine in order to di&s;cover Madame du Frene." How did my heart overflow with grati|tude at this unexpected invitation! Young and unacquainted as I was with the arts of men, I ha&s;|tily accepted his offer; and, indeed, my joy and impatience to begin my journey was too con&s;pi|cuous to be concealed. Accordingly it was a|greed, that he &s;hould &s;et out on the next day, in order to prepare his &s;i&s;ter for my arrival; and that in three days after I &s;hould follow with Ma|ry, who had agreed to accompany me to London.</P>
<P>"Nothing could exceed my eagerne&s;s and im|patience for the arrival of the day on which I was to &s;et out; and I &s;carce gave my&s;elf time for pro|per re&s;t, and none at all for reflection. The hope of meeting my dear Madame du Frene, together with that &s;ecret wi&s;h which &s;till glowed in my bo|&s;om of hearing &s;omething of Eugene, was cheri&s;h|ed

with &s;uch fond imagination, that I had almo&s;t realized my wi&s;hes to a certainty; and when we entered London, my fancy had formed &s;o many fair ideas, by which I was wholly engro&s;&s;ed, that I hardly attended to the a&s;toni&s;hed exclamations of poor Mary, at the &s;ight of the &s;treets, number of people, carriages, &amp;c. &amp;c. which to me, who had lived &s;o long in Paris, was nothing extraor|dinary; but when the carriage drove up to a ve|ry magnificent hou&s;e in Portland Place, my heart felt an unu&s;ual oppre&s;&s;ion; and, for the fir&s;t time, &s;ugge&s;ted to me the impropriety of following to London a per&s;on of whom I knew &s;o little; how|ever, reflections of this kind were now too late. The chai&s;e &s;topped; the bell was rung, and two footmen, in &s;plendid liveries, u&s;hered me through the hall, up a &s;tone &s;tairca&s;e.</P>
<P>"My a&s;toni&s;hment increa&s;ed as I a&s;cended the &s;teps. Mr Thoranby had told me he lived in a hand&s;ome hou&s;e in London; but I had no idea it was &s;o &s;uperb, &s;till le&s;s that his &s;i&s;ter lived in this elegant &s;tyle. I fancied there mu&s;t have been &s;ome mi&s;take, and a variety of reflections ru&s;hed with rapidity upon my mind, and a thou&s;and forebodings, of I knew not what, agitated me &s;o

much, that I fancied I did not hear di&s;tinctly whom the &s;ervant addre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>"Mr Thoranby (who then made his appear|ance) by the appellation of "my Lord;" but when he approached to receive me, with a malig|nant &s;mile of exultation, my heart died within me, and I faintly exclaimed, "I am betrayed."</P>
<P>"It was in vain that his lord&s;hip endeavored to &s;ooth me, after having acknowledged that he had deceived me re&s;pecting his having a &s;i&s;ter, as well as his name and rank. I at once &s;aw my ruined &s;ituation; and I exclaimed on the cruelty of his conduct, demanding immediate relea&s;e. He pleaded the mo&s;t ardent love, prote&s;ting that he could not live without me.

<P>"Yes, my dear Laura," &s;ays he, "you &s;hould pity rather than condemn a man who is united to a woman for whom he can conceive nothing but aver&s;ion, and who is in no re&s;pect calculated for dome&s;tic happine&s;s, whil&s;t his heart is enraptured by your virtues, and ab&s;olutely devoted to your &s;ervice; nothing but this prior <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;hould pre|vent

<P>"I had &s;carce patience to hear him to the end&mdash;"Marry me! (I replied) is it po&s;&s;ible that your vanity can &s;ugge&s;t &s;uch an idea? Did you bring me here to dazzle me with your &s;plendor, as a means to gain me to your purpo&s;e?

<P>"Peace, madam," &s;aid he; "nor dare to in|&s;ult me thus. Age, indeed! know, &s;illy girl, that you are in my power; and if you provoke that power; I warn you to take the con&s;equence." With the&s;e words he ha&s;tily quitted the room, leaving me to reflect upon my di&s;tre&s;&s;ed &s;ituation, with the additional torment of &s;elf-accu&s;ation for having brought my&s;elf into his power.</P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="035640_0096_100693B50E500060">
"During two whole days I &s;aw nothing of his lord&s;hip, though I learned from Mary (who was &s;till allowed to attend me) that he was in the hou&s;e, and that all the &s;ervants had orders to obey me in every thing, except a&s;&s;i&s;ting me to leave it. She likewi&s;e informed me, that lady Oakendale was no further from London than Hamp&s;tead. Various were my conjectures upon his conduct. Sometimes I thought he would relent, and give me my liberty; at others, that he was only medi|tating further mi&s;chief. I had no hope of making my e&s;cape; for the rooms I was allowed to occu|py were not in the front of the hou&s;e, and only looked into a clo&s;e paved court, from whence I could not po&s;&s;ibly get out, were I to attempt the windows. My mind was harra&s;&s;ed by &s;leeple&s;s nights and continual fatigue.</P>
<P>"On the third morning Lord Oakendale enter|ed the apartment; he &s;hewed &s;ome degree of compa&s;&s;ion at my pale and altered looks; and then &s;aid, "You have fooli&s;hly rejected all my offers; but &s;urely that mu&s;t proceed from a ha&s;ty judgment, and becau&s;e you have not well con&s;i|dered them.

I mean to &s;end you down to an old Abbey in Cumberland, with Mary to accompany you, or any other of my dome&s;tics whom you may prefer. It is true, you will be but ill accommodated; but for that you may thank your own ob&s;tinacy, and you will there have lei&s;ure to con&s;ider my propo&s;als with the attention they de&s;erve."</P>
<P>"The idea of an Abbey made me &s;hudder; but when I con&s;idered I &s;hould be relea&s;ed from my pre&s;ent pri&s;on, and that he &s;aid not a word of going with me, I thought it mo&s;t prudent to di&s;|&s;emble; I therefore told him, in a milder tone than I had &s;poken before, that I was ready to fol|low whither&s;oever my de&s;tiny &s;hould lead me; that I cho&s;e Mary for my companion, and that I would con&s;ider of what he had &s;aid with more moderation. A &s;mile of approbation &s;at upon his countenance as I uttered the la&s;t &s;entence. He took me tenderly by the hand, and &s;aid, "Then I will in&s;tantly order the carriage to be got rea|dy:"

and having a&s;&s;ured him it &s;hould not wait for me, he quitted me to give the nece&s;&s;ary orders.</P>
<P>"The moment he was gone, a gleam of &s;atis|faction over&s;pread my mind at the idea of leaving that dete&s;ted hou&s;e. At the &s;ame moment a tran&s;|itory regret occurred at the thoughts of leaving London; that London, to which I had ha&s;tened with &s;uch rapidity, and which probably contained all that was mo&s;t dear to me; yet, to gain, in &s;ome degree, my liberty, and to leave Lord Oakendale was my fir&s;t object; and I re&s;olved to make no more ha&s;ty determinations; nor even attempt to make my e&s;cape without a great deal of delibera|tion and circum&s;pection. Mary con&s;ented to ac|company me; but it was evidently with reluct|ance. The &s;plendor of Lord Oakendale's e&s;ta|bli&s;hment had attracted her admiration, and &s;he wi&s;hed to &s;tay longer and &s;ee more; but &s;he was a fooli&s;h uninformed creature, and on that &s;core I excu&s;ed her; and thinking &s;he was a more tru&s;|ty companion than any Lord Oakendale could furni&s;h me with, I pre&s;&s;ed her to accompany me; at the &s;ame time giving her &s;ome money for the &s;ervices &s;he had already done me, and in order to &s;ecure her future fidelity; we therefore &s;tepped

into the carriage, which I found was loaded with provi&s;ions, that we might have no occa&s;ion to &s;top, except for change of hor&s;es. We were at|tended by two &s;ervants on hor&s;e-back, and &s;uch precautions taken, that it would have been in vain to have meditated an e&s;cape. How ardently did I wi&s;h to be attacked by robbers, as the only means I could fore&s;ee of gaining my liberty; but no &s;uch good fortune happening, we, after a fa|tiguing journey, arrived at Oakendale Abbey."&mdash;And here Laura continued to relate all the terrors &s;he had experienced in that place, as well as the manner of her e&s;caping; not omitting to inform Mrs. Greville the circum&s;tance of her finding the letter ca&s;e &s;he had given to Eugene.</P>
<P>When &s;he had fini&s;hed her &s;tory, Mrs Greville &s;aid, "Indeed, my dear young lady, your &s;tory is replete with uncommon circum&s;tances of di&s;|tre&s;s; and I am as much intere&s;ted by it, as I am &s;urpri&s;ed and entertained. If your appearance prejudiced me in your favor, your uncommon &s;uf|ferings and merit entitle you to my regard and protection, which you may be a&s;&s;ured of po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ing as long as you are di&s;po&s;ed to continue under my roof.</P>
<P><PB N="101" REF="035640_0100_100693C2720C7060">
"I have (continued the good lady) a nephew, who is married to a very amiable woman; his name is Sir George Orland, and they pa&s;s great part of the year with me; you will, I am &s;ure, like each other, and if you pay them a vi&s;it in London, they will protect you from the attempts of Lord Oakendale as well as a&s;&s;i&s;t your inquiries concerning tho&s;e &s;o de&s;ervedly dear to you."</P>
<P>Laura could not find words &s;ufficient to thank Mrs. Greville for her extreme kindne&s;s; and, having exhau&s;ted the effu&s;ions of her grateful heart, &s;he began a&s;king Mrs. Greville &s;ome que&s;|tions as to what &s;he knew, or had ever heard, re|lating to Oakendale-Abbey.</P>
<P>"Why," returned Mrs. Greville, "when you named Oakendale-Abbey, as having re&s;ided there, I confe&s;s I &s;huddered at the idea; neverthele&s;s I would not have you &s;uppo&s;e that I believe in any of the idle reports current in the neigh|borhood; for they are carried to a degree of ab|&s;urdity and &s;uper&s;tition beyond all credit. When they tell you of men and women being &s;een car|rying their heads in their hands, and of mon&s;trous eyes looking through the windows flaming with
<PB N="102" REF="035640_0101_100693C7C193ABD8">
fire, one is more inclined to laugh at &s;uch idle tales than to be alarmed by them. But I mu&s;t own I have long &s;u&s;pected there was &s;ome my&s;te|ry to be unfolded at the Abbey; but of what na|ture I cannot even gue&s;s. The &s;urpri&s;ing things you witne&s;&s;ed there confirms this belief, and I wi&s;h it were &s;eriou&s;ly inve&s;tigated.</P>
<P>"It is now many years &s;ince I &s;aw the in&s;ide of the Abbey; and it was by no means a fit re&s;i|dence for the fair inhabitant whom I went to vi|&s;it; it mu&s;t be now infinitely wor&s;e, and a fright|ful place to &s;end a young per&s;on to! I only won|der how you could &s;upport your&s;elf under &s;uch circum&s;tances; and it is like the re&s;t of Lord Oak|endale's conduct."</P>
<P>"My dear Madam," &s;aid Laura, "I under|&s;tand the Abbey had not been inhabited &s;ince the memory of any per&s;on now living; who then could you go there to vi&s;it?"</P>
<P>"Indeed," replied Mrs. Greville, "I ought to explain my&s;elf; for what I &s;aid mu&s;t &s;eem as my&s;terious as any of the &s;tories which are related. I went to &s;ee a picture of the pre&s;ent Lord's mo|ther, which, upon &s;ome family feuds, was &s;ent down to this Abbey as a puni&s;hment, or rather
<PB N="103" REF="035640_0102_100693CA08EE7020">
mortification, to the per&s;on it repre&s;ented. He was allowed to be an uncommonly and well fini&s;h|ed picture, and was done by an Italian ma&s;ter; and the &s;weetne&s;s of the countenance exceeded any I ever &s;aw, except that I am now beholding!"</P>
<P>Laura bowed her thanks for the compliment, and a&s;ked Mrs. Greville "if the picture did not hand in a room which &s;he de&s;cribed; and if it was not in the Vandyke ta&s;te?"</P>
<P>Mrs. Greville replied, "that it was, and was a beautiful full length portrait."</P>
<P>"Yes," &s;aid Laura, "it was in that room that I di&s;covered the letter-ca&s;e; and I can never be per&s;uaded but Eugene mu&s;t have been in that apart|ment; for I think (&s;he added, with a &s;igh) he would not have parted with it to any one el&s;e."</P>
<P>"That is, indeed," &s;aid Mrs. Greville, "a ve|ry extraordinary circum&s;tance, and which time only can di&s;cover, and will, I have no doubt; for depend upon it, my dear, you will live to &s;ee the clouds di&s;per&s;e, which at pre&s;ent &s;eem to hang over you; and you will one day meet with the reward your merit de&s;erves.&mdash;In the mean|while make your&s;elf ea&s;y under my protection;
<PB N="104" REF="035640_0103_100693CF5F25E850">
and wait with patience the will of that all wi&s;e di&s;po&s;er of events, who never de&s;erted the inno|cent, and who is a Father to the fatherle&s;s."</P>
<P>Laura &s;aid &s;he had every rea&s;on to be grateful to Providence, who had, in &s;o many in&s;tances, &s;hewn a manife&s;t interpo&s;ition in her favor, and never more than by placing her under the pro|tection where &s;he now felt her&s;elf &s;o happily &s;itu|ated; and in which &s;ecure a&s;ylum we will, for the pre&s;ent, leave her, and return to give &s;ome account of Lord Oakendale, who on arriving at the Abbey, and finding Laura had e&s;caped, be|came outrageous, and almo&s;t frantic with di&s;ap|pointment.</P>
<P>Mary was interrogated with violence and &s;u&s;|picion, as an accomplice in the plan; but &s;he declared her innocence with &s;o much &s;implicity, that his lord&s;hip's anger at length gave way to belief, and he con&s;ented to her entreaties of be|ing &s;ent back again into Wales.</P>
<P>His di&s;appointment added fre&s;h fuel to his pa&s;|&s;ion and his re&s;entment; for he vowed ven|geance on the poor devoted Laura, &s;hould he ever get her again into his hands, of which he enter|tained but little doubt; knowing that without
<PB N="105" REF="035640_0104_100693D2A7959F08">
either hor&s;e or carriage, or any one to a&s;&s;i&s;t her, &s;he could not have e&s;caped far from the village; and that, by bribes and promi&s;es, he &s;hould very &s;oon have her again in his power. He determin|ed to &s;leep that night at the Abbey, in the &s;ame bed which had been occupied by Laura and Mary. Another was fitted up in an adjoining room for his &s;ervant.</P>
<P>It was the fir&s;t time in his life he had ever been in the Abbey. He thought it horrible and gloo|my; and he would have felt &s;ome compa&s;&s;ion for Laura, for having been con&s;igned to &s;uch a place, had not her recent flight &s;teeled his heart with re&s;entment, and &s;hut every avenue to pity.</P>
<P>The idea of &s;upernatural appearances had nev|er, &s;ince he was a child, di&s;turbed his imagina|tion; he therefore, dive&s;ted of all fear, compo&s;|ed him&s;elf to take a refre&s;hing portion of &s;leep, in order to be the better enabled to make a more vigilant pur&s;uit after Laura the next day. He had not, however, been in bed two hours before he was very much &s;urpri&s;ed by a foot-&s;tep, and a low murmuring voice, which apeared to be not far di&s;tant. He called his &s;ervant.</P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="035640_0105_100693D5A98F9278">
The poor man readily obeyed the &s;ummons, for he had been equally alarmed. He entered the room pale and trembling, and was going to re|late his fears; but Lord Oakendale felt his val|our return, and being a&s;hamed to confe&s;s his fright to his &s;ervant, he only &s;aid there were rats in the hou&s;e; talked loud, blu&s;tered, and ordered his &s;ervant to return to his bed.</P>
<P>In about an hour the &s;teps and the voice were heard again. The idea that Laura was conceal|ed in &s;ome part of the Abbey occuring to his mind, he ha&s;tily called up his &s;ervant, and order|ing him to bring lights, he prepared him&s;elf to &s;earch the Abbey. The man having heard the report of its being haunted, and being already very much alarmed at what had pa&s;&s;ed, was not quite &s;o willing to enter into &s;uch &s;ervice, and endeavoured to per&s;uade his Lord to wait for the morning; but this &s;ugge&s;tion only &s;timulated Lord Oakendale to begin the &s;earch, having worked up his mind to the firm opinion that he &s;hould find Laura. They each took a light, and proceeded through all the apartments; Lord Oakendale with his &s;word drawn in his hand, &s;wearing to murder the fir&s;t per&s;on he found, if
<PB N="107" REF="035640_0106_100693D890426638">
they &s;hould endeavour to &s;creen Laura from his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. He likewi&s;e exhorted his &s;ervant to be courageous, and to follow his example.</P>
<P>The man &s;tood greatly in need of the exhorta|tions; for as he tremblingly led the way, and carried the lights, he expected to lo&s;e his &s;en&s;es by the &s;ight of &s;ome tremendous apparition; and when Lord Oakendale opened the ru&s;ty locks and creaking doors, he thought his heart would have died within him.</P>
<P>When they approached the room, in which was the trunk and &s;keleton, Lord Oakendale made a &s;top.&mdash;The gloomine&s;s of its appearance, rendered doubly &s;o by the &s;till dark hour of the night, had a momentary effect upon his re&s;olu|tion; but he re&s;umed his courage, and &s;urveyed the room. The &s;ervant trembled, and &s;carcely lifted up his eyes. They approached the trunk wherein the &s;keleton was depo&s;ited. Lord Oak|endale ordered his &s;ervant to lift up the lid; and the light had no &s;ooner glanced upon the gha&s;tly figure, than the man, dropping the lid from his hand, exclaimed, "God pre&s;erve us! here is a dead man, bigger than a giant, with &s;aucer eyes, and huge limbs!"</P>
<P><PB N="108" REF="035640_0107_100693DE317CDE78">
"Ridiculous!" exclaimed his Lord, at the &s;ame moment examining it him&s;elf, though not without feeling a chill at this relic of mortality; and he was for a moment undetermined whether or not to proceed, when the idea of Laura again renewed his courage, and he advanced to the cloi&s;ter, and following the light carried by the terrified &s;ervant, arrived at the partition, which pre&s;ented neither a door, or any means of open|ing it, what&s;oever.</P>
<P>This circum&s;tance &s;trongly excited his curio&s;i|ty, and this aided by di&s;appointment, brought him to a de&s;perate pitch of re&s;olution; and ob|&s;erving the boards were but thin, he &s;et his whole force again&s;t them, and, with a terrible cra&s;h, they all at once gave way. A confu&s;ed rumbling noi&s;e a&s;&s;ailed his ears; but how were all his &s;en|&s;es &s;tiffened with horror at the &s;ight of a human body, apparently dead, but &s;itting upright in a coffin!</P>
<P>Lord Oakendale &s;tarted at the &s;ight; the &s;word dropped from his hand, and he &s;tood petrified with terror and amazement. The &s;ervant had fallen down, and nearly extingui&s;hed the light; and as Lord Oakendale &s;tooped down to pre&s;erve
<PB N="109" REF="035640_0108_100693E20593AC60">
it, he fancied a cold hand gra&s;ped him. His trembling legs &s;carce &s;upported him from this &s;cene of terror! The &s;ervant was nearly deprived of his &s;en&s;es. His ma&s;ter a&s;&s;i&s;ted him to ri&s;e, and ha&s;tily turning towards the cloi&s;ter, they made the be&s;t of their way through the apartments they had before &s;o minutely examined, ru&s;hed out of the Abbey, and alarmed the village!</P>
<P>The clock &s;truck four, and &s;ome of the pea|&s;ants were already ri&s;ing to their work: and &s;ee|ing his Lord&s;hip, as they &s;uppo&s;ed, making his e&s;cape from the Abbey, they, concluding he had &s;een &s;omething to terrify and alarm him, gather|ed round, with a hope of being gratified by &s;ome marvelous adventure; but his Lord&s;hip was in no humour to relate wonders. He ordered hor&s;es to the carriage, and getting into it, be&s;towed &s;omething like a cur&s;e upon Laura, the Abbey, and all the infernal &s;pirits that inhabited it.</P>
<P>In this di&s;po&s;ition he pur&s;ued his way to Lon|don. Various were his conjectures during his journey; and he could form his ideas into no &s;y&s;tem of probability as to the &s;trange and unac|countable &s;ights he had beheld at the Abbey. He
<PB N="110" REF="035640_0109_100693E5F8DC1760">
re&s;olved, indeed, to have them thoroughly in|ve&s;tigated on &s;ome future occa&s;ion; but he never intended again to encounter them him&s;elf. He &s;uffered great unea&s;ine&s;s on account of Laura. He &s;ound he loved her with &s;incere affection. Her idea dwelt upon his heart with more unea&s;y &s;en|&s;ations than he had ever before experienced, al|though his love for her was neither founded up|on e&s;teem or delicacy. But he was a mere &s;en&s;u|ali&s;t; yet a &s;omething of tender anxiety was com|bined with his pa&s;&s;ion for her. "Where could &s;he be, and to what evils and &s;ufferings might &s;he be expo&s;ed?" The&s;e were intruding que&s;tions that forced them&s;elves with compa&s;&s;ionate tender|ne&s;s, upon a heart but little alive to the &s;ofter feelings of humanity. In this &s;tate we will there|fore leave him for the pre&s;ent, in order to give our readers an account of &s;ome other per&s;onages who have as yet appeared but in the back ground of the hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>Lady Oakendale, of whom we have &s;aid that &s;he was the only daughter of Lord We&s;thaven, and that her immen&s;e fortune was the only induce|ment Lord Oakendale had for making her his wife, was, as has been before related, by no means calculated to &s;ooth the brow of care, by

But, in order to e|lucidate her hi&s;tory, we mu&s;t go back to a very early period of her life. She was an only child, and had lo&s;t her mother when &s;he was very young; and from that circum&s;tance might date all her mis|fortunes, as &s;he was con&s;igned to the care of a governe&s;s, and other mercenary dependants, who&s;e chief object was to inculcate in her the idea of her own con&s;equence, by continually reminding her of her great fortune &s;he would in future po&s;|&s;e&s;s, as well as the high rank &s;he held in life.</P>
<P>After being taught the various accompli&s;hments nece&s;&s;ary for her &s;ituation, in &s;o &s;uperficial a man|ner, that they could neither be an entertainment to others, nor any re&s;ource to her&s;elf, &s;he &s;ound a void in her mind, which &s;he would &s;ometimes endeavour to fill up by attempts at fancy-work, of &s;ome ingenious device peculiar to the &s;ex; but on the&s;e occa&s;ions &s;he was always informed, that &s;uch employments were by no means fit for her to engage in; and that there were people &s;uffici|ent who would be glad to do &s;uch little &s;ervices for the gratuity which &s;he had it &s;o amply in her power to be&s;tow.</P>
<P><PB N="112" REF="035640_0111_100693EC062B5880">
Thus was her mind (perhaps naturally good) withdrawn from every &s;ource of in&s;truction or amu&s;ement, and left to the idle workings of phan|ta&s;tic conceits, which will always, if not &s;ubdued by rational amu&s;ements, lead to an indolent la&s;&s;i|tude, totally de&s;tructive of every moral and &s;ocial virtue.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as &s;he was of an age to appear at her father's table, and be indroduced by &s;ome of his acquaintance to public places, her whole mornings were &s;pent in trying on various caps, and other dre&s;&s;es; con&s;ulting her gla&s;s, and a&s;&s;orting her ribbands and feathers to her complexion, and the color of her hair. Her per&s;on was neither hand|&s;ome or otherwi&s;e; her &s;kin was fair, but her fea|tures were irregular and wanted animation; and &s;he had acquired an air of hauteur, which, being unaccompanied by grace, bordered upon ill-hu|mor.</P>
<P>Lord We&s;thaven, after the death of his wife, grew fond of drinking, and engaged in a di&s;&s;ipat|ed way of life, neither con&s;i&s;tent with his age or &s;tation. He loved his daughter, as &s;omething very nearly allied to him&s;elf; but he took no pains to regulate her conduct, or to improve her
<PB N="113" REF="035640_0112_100693EDEAFF1480">
under&s;tanding. He frequently brought men home to dinner, who&s;e free conver&s;ation was nei|ther &s;uppre&s;&s;ed by her pre&s;ence, nor regulated by propriety; and from the&s;e &s;he heard toa&s;ts and &s;entiments by no means proper for her contem|plation; which gave her a bold a&s;&s;urance, but little con&s;i&s;tent with the delicacy of the feminine character.</P>
<P>She was known to have an immen&s;e fortune, and of cour&s;e was addre&s;&s;ed by every man who wi&s;hed to advance his own.</P>
<P>An officer in the guards, of the name of Vin|cent, was the mo&s;t a&s;&s;iduous in his attentions to her; and, indeed, for a time, kept all the re&s;t at a di&s;tance. He had an uncommon fine per&s;on, and was &s;ufficiently well &s;killed in the &s;cience of fa&s;hion and flattery to render him&s;elf agreeable. He &s;tudied her di&s;po&s;ition with the nice&s;t atten|tion; and, being well aware that her father de|&s;igned her for a man of rank, having no preten|&s;ions of that nature at that time, he was re&s;olved to &s;upplant tho&s;e that had; he therefore thought he had only to &s;ecure her affections as the prelude to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her fortune.</P>
<P><PB N="114" REF="035640_0113_100693F24F6200E8">
She loved Vincent as a girl of her education and di&s;po&s;ition would naturally do, who was cap|tivated by his per&s;on, and plea&s;ed with his atten|tions. But &s;he knew he could not introduce her into the rank in life her ambition led her to &s;up|po&s;e &s;he mu&s;t fill, and &s;he could not endure the &s;ound of plain Mrs Vincent; yet the idea of a tender lover, encouraged in &s;ecret, and met by &s;tratagem, enraptured her imagination, and was &s;o con&s;onant to her wi&s;hes, that what &s;he fir&s;t ad|mitted as a charming amu&s;ement for her lei&s;ure hours, became a &s;erious con&s;ideration, and in the end, a &s;ource of increa&s;ing mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>It happened about this time that the Earl of Oakendale was introduced to her by her father; and, after a few interviews, &s;he was told to con&s;i|der him as her lover and de&s;tined hu&s;band.</P>
<P>Lord Oakendale was a man whom Mi&s;s Rain&s;|ford might have liked, had not her heart been devoted to Vincent; yet the idea of being a Counte&s;s, with all the flattering appendages of a title, gave a preponderancy to the &s;cale of gran|deur, and made her accept of Lord Oakendale's propo&s;als, and her father's commands, without any &s;eeming reluctance.</P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="035640_0114_100693F46A33F098">
Meantime Vincent could not bear to lo&s;e the golden prize, and have the mortification to be|hold, what he had thought &s;o well &s;ecured to him|&s;elf, given to another. Thus fired with jealou&s;y, and di&s;appointed in his ambitious views, he me|ditated mi&s;chief and revenge. Fir&s;t he thought to induce her to con&s;ent to a clande&s;tine marriage; but the idea that, in ca&s;e of high re&s;entment from her father, &s;he might, in&s;tead of a large portion, not bring him a &s;hilling, proved a too weighty con&s;equence, and he dur&s;t not ri&s;que &s;uch a chance.</P>
<P>The next &s;ugge&s;tion wore a more fea&s;ible a&s;|pect. Mi&s;s Rainsford loved him pa&s;&s;ionately, though he believed &s;he loved title and &s;plendor better; the only way then to &s;upplant his rival, and &s;ecure his intere&s;t, was to make a marriage with him nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ave her reputation. There were tender moments, in which Mi&s;s Rainsford's prudence might yield to love, and probable con|&s;equences might bring even the Earl to &s;olicit a marriage, to which, under no other circum&s;tan|ces, he would have con&s;ented.</P>
<P>Having concerted this plan; not indeed the mo&s;t honorable one, but &s;uch as might well be ex|pected from the nature of the parties concerned,
<PB N="116" REF="035640_0115_100693F8FB54A110">
he &s;tudied, at the next private interview, the mo&s;t in&s;inuating addre&s;s, and the mo&s;t pathetic com|plaints. He knew the exact &s;tate of Mi&s;s Rains|ford's heart, and upon what principle all her &s;en|timents were guided. He lamented, in terms of de&s;pair, his cruel and unmerited fate; he declar|ed his love was founded upon the noble&s;t ba&s;is, that of affection for her alone; whil&s;t Lord Oak|endale's was merely for her fortune, without the &s;malle&s;t particle of pa&s;&s;ion for that enchanting per&s;on, which was the &s;ole object of his adora|tion; yet &s;uch was his regard, &s;uch his &s;elf-de|nial, that he would renounce all hope, and yield her to his hated rival; whil&s;t he tore him&s;elf a|way, never more to behold her, and &s;ought, in the field of battle, that death which alone could relea&s;e him from the mi&s;ery of his pre&s;ent &s;uffer|ings.</P>
<P>This was a language too per&s;ua&s;ive, and too powerful, for the tender feelings of Mi&s;s Rains|ford. Charmed with &s;uch flattering delu&s;ions &s;he could refu&s;e nothing to &s;o fond and tender a lover; her melting heart acknowledged all his influence, and &s;he became his mi&s;tre&s;s. For a|while the &s;tolen enjoyments became &s;weeter by repetition; but what were the mortifying reflec|tion
<PB N="117" REF="035640_0116_100693FD25562AA0">
&s;he underwent, when a &s;hort time &s;hewed the effects of their illicit connexion.</P>
<P>This was the boundary of Vincent's wi&s;hes, and he concluded his fortune made; yet &s;uch was the &s;trange and unnatural di&s;po&s;ition of Mi&s;s Rainsford, whether ambition got the better of all &s;ofter ties, or from whatever cau&s;e her mind was influenced, &s;he no &s;ooner di&s;covered her &s;ituation than &s;he conceived a mortal aver&s;ion to the au|thor of her di&s;grace; and, contrary to all his ex|pectations, and to his utter a&s;toni&s;hment, &s;he gave every encouragement to the match with Lord Oakendale. Struck with aver&s;ion and di&s;|gu&s;t to the woman, who could be capable of ac|ting &s;o contrary to delicacy and every feminine virtue, his heart recoiled at the idea of a marri|age with her, and he &s;ecretly triumphed in the di&s;grace of his rival.</P>
<P>Meantime &s;ome embarra&s;&s;ing circum&s;tances oc|cured relating to the &s;ettlements of e&s;tates, and nece&s;&s;arily delayed the match, which Mi&s;s Rains|ford could not, with propriety, ha&s;ten. Her &s;ituation, therefore, was become truly dreadful; and before the completion of the &s;ettlements, &s;he found her&s;elf four months advanced in her preg|nancy,
<PB N="118" REF="035640_0117_10069400022387F8">
by the man whom &s;he had &s;acrificed to her ambition; and which ambition &s;till urged her to complete the &s;acrifice by giving her hand at the altar to Lord Oakendale. The con&s;equence of this marriage has before been de&s;cribed.</P>
<P>Driven to the la&s;t extremity, within two months of her time, every day making it more difficult to conceal her &s;ituation, and finding it impo&s;&s;ible, from the date of her marriage to impo&s;e the fruit of her guilt upon her Lord, &s;he had recour&s;e to the coun&s;el and opinion of a confidante&mdash;the woman who had been her favored attendant from her youth, and to who&s;e pernicious flattery, and improper advice, &s;he, in &s;ome degree owed her ruin!</P>
<P>This woman's name was Marcel; &s;he was a native of France, and had improved the deceit and hypocri&s;y of that country by the lowe&s;t vices of this; &s;he &s;eemed, however the proper friend, upon this trying emergency. After lady Oak|endale had bribed her to &s;ecrecy, &s;he intru&s;ted her with the whole hi&s;tory of her amour; and, having con&s;ulted upon the wi&s;e&s;t and mo&s;t pru|dent methods, &s;he &s;ugge&s;ted that of retiring into the country, under the pretence of ill health,
<PB N="119" REF="035640_0118_10069402F4E824C8">
where &s;he would remain till after her delivery; and this was the more ea&s;y to put in practice from the little attention Lord Oakendale had ever &s;hewn to his lady &s;ince their marriage; for he &s;eemed never in the &s;malle&s;t degree, intere&s;ted a|bout any thing &s;he did, or ever paid the lea&s;t re|gard to her health, or any thing that concerned her. Thus was &s;he at full liberty to pur&s;ue her own plan and inclinations.</P>
<P>Every thing therefore was arranged, and &s;he went to a retired village in Buckingham&s;hire; where, pa&s;&s;ing for the widow of an officer, &s;he was delivered of a &s;on in the pre&s;ence of only the accoucheur, and her faithful confidante.</P>
<P>The former had been engaged to &s;ecrecy upon his honor, for he was above taking a larger bribe than his &s;ee; and Marcel was to provide a pro|per nur&s;e, and entirely undertake the charge of the infant.</P>
<P>The gentleman employed upon this occa&s;ion was by nature humane, and from principle gene|rous. Without prying into the rea&s;ons which made &s;ecrecy nece&s;&s;ary, he always wi&s;hed to wit|ne&s;s the effu&s;ions of natural affection from the mo|ther to her off&s;pring, under what&s;oever circum|&s;tances
<PB N="120" REF="035640_0119_1006940623CDB5E0">
it might be produced; he therefore took the &s;miling babe to the &s;ight of lady Oakendale, in the hope that its helple&s;s innocence might plead for maternal protection. But no &s;ooner had &s;he ca&s;t her eyes upon the unfortunate object of her di&s;grace, than &s;he gave a &s;hriek of abhorrence, and begged he would take the odious brat from her &s;ight!</P>
<P>Shocked at her inhuman exclamation, he ten|derly wrapped up the infant, &s;aying, "Poor child! this unnatural behavior will lead me to di&s;cover the my&s;tery of thy birth; and amply &s;hall thy unfeeling mother provide for thy nece&s;|&s;ities."</P>
<P>He proved his words; for he made &s;uch enqui|ries as &s;atisfied his curio&s;ity, and ju&s;tified he mea&s;ures he took to &s;ee that the child was pro|perly nur&s;ed; and during its infancy and after|wards, he repeatedly obtained large &s;ums from lady Oakendale for its education; for he made no &s;cruple to inform her lady&s;hip that he knew the whole &s;ecret, which he threatened to expo&s;e and di&s;cover, unle&s;s &s;he acquie&s;ced in his demands. In reality he could only gue&s;s at the tran&s;action; but as her allowance for pin-money was very am|ple,
<PB N="121" REF="035640_0120_1006940A024BC8A8">
and he had taken an uncommon fancy to the child, as it advanced in years, he took the entire charge of him, and cho&s;e that the boy's education &s;hould be upon the mo&s;t liberal plan.</P>
<P>Nothing was omitted that could improve his capacity, and give him every advantage; and he had attained the age of twenty years, adorned with every grace and accompli&s;hment, which ele|gance of per&s;on and a natural under&s;tanding, en|larged by the highe&s;t cultivation, could be&s;tow, without ever experiencing one glance of parental favor.</P>
<P>There was no part of his life, in which he had been led to &s;uppo&s;e him&s;elf the &s;on of this humane guardian of his youth.</P>
<P>After repeated interrogatories to gain the know|ledge, to whom he owed his being, Mr. F&mdash;informed him; that he was really ignorant of the name of his father, but he knew his mother, and that &s;ome time or other he &s;hould be introduced to her. This time was now approach|ing. Mr F&mdash;was brother to Mon&s;ieur du Frene, to whom he had &s;ent Eugene, in order to make a proficiency in the French language; and
<PB N="122" REF="035640_0121_1006940D417E56E8">
likewi&s;e to gain that poli&s;h &s;o nece&s;&s;ary for a fi|ni&s;hed character, and to which the ea&s;y manners of the French nation generally contributed.</P>
<P>The duel, in which he had &s;o unfortunately engaged, together with the tender attachment he had formed with Laura, were improprieties of a &s;ufficient magnitude for Mr. F&mdash;to recall him to England; and to take care that none of the many letters, in which he vowed eternal con&s;tan|cy to Laura &s;hould ever be forwarded from En|gland. If, in this in&s;tance, Mr. F&mdash;&s;hould be blamed for duplicity and unju&s;t dealing, it mu&s;t be allowed in his favor, that he con&s;idered Eugene as a pledge of honor, for who&s;e con|duct he mu&s;t one day be accountable. He had &s;tolen him from his nur&s;e at a very early age, and &s;ecreted him from lady Oakendale and Marcel, in order to re&s;tore him as a poli&s;hed gem when the time arrived, that his virtues &s;hould be ren|dered con&s;picuous.</P>
<P>Had Eugene fallen in love with any other than an adopted child of his brother's, he would have let the progre&s;s of their attachment taken its cour&s;e; as it was, his con&s;cience would not allow of Eugene's forming a connexion, which he con|&s;idered
<PB N="123" REF="035640_0122_1006940F009E1C90">
far beneath his birth, until he had been properly acknowledged by tho&s;e to whom he was united by the deare&s;t ties.</P>
<P>Lady Oakendale, from the hour of her marri|age, had never experienced a moment of felicity, except that which &s;he derived from a round of di&s;&s;ipation, and moving in the vortex of fa&s;hion. Her Lord never cared for her. The fortune &s;he had brought him was the only inducement he ever had for making her his wife; and neither of them had endeavored to render the marriage &s;tate hap|py, by any attempts to plea&s;e the other.</P>
<P>Lady Oakendale had, &s;oon after her marriage, the mortification to hear that Captain Vincent had &s;ucceeded to a title and e&s;tate, by the unex|pected death of a di&s;tant relation. He was now Edward Lord Vincent of Vincent Ca&s;tle, in the kingdom of Ireland. He had been twice marri|ed; but had no children by either of his wives, and the title and e&s;tate at his death would de|&s;cend to a very di&s;tant branch, if he left no heir; but he had a power of appointing a &s;ucce&s;&s;or to his e&s;tate, though not to his title.</P>
<P>The fruit of his intrigue with lady Oakendale often occured to his remembrance. He had ne|ver
<PB N="124" REF="035640_0123_10069414721E0078">
made any inquiries of her lady&s;hip concern|ing it; and &s;he, on account of her having the &s;e|cret profoundly ob&s;erved, had carefully kept him from every information concerning the event. Lord Vincent, now wi&s;hing more than ever to know if he was a father, and feeling the nece&s;&s;ity of appointing an heir to his va&s;t fortune, cau&s;ed an indirect application to be made to her lady|&s;hip concerning his off&s;pring, and to know if it now exi&s;ted.</P>
<P>Alarmed at this unexpected demand, and ter|rified left the &s;ecret &s;hould be di&s;covered, &s;he in|&s;tantly &s;ent for Mr. F&mdash;, de&s;iring him to con|ceal, as far as po&s;&s;ible, the &s;on &s;he knew he had taken under his care, as it was now become a matter of the utmo&s;t importance to her, that his birth &s;hould be buried in oblivion; and as &s;he had a&s;&s;ured Lord Vincent that the child had died in its infancy, it became nece&s;&s;ary to engage Mr. F&mdash;to corroborate the fal&s;hood.</P>
<P>Having, therefore, explained her motives, Mr. F&mdash;found this was the moment of di&s;covery for which he had &s;o long wi&s;hed and was likely to be fortunate for his young favorite; he there|fore determined to di&s;&s;emble and acquie&s;ce in her
<PB N="125" REF="035640_0124_100694189696A378">
demands till he had gained the wi&s;hed for intelli|gence; he therefore told her lady&s;hip, that it en|tirely depended upon her&s;elf to &s;ecure his confi|dence, by informing him, without re&s;erve, who was the real father of that &s;on, who&s;e future con|cealment alone depended upon a true information.</P>
<P>She at fir&s;t re&s;olutely refu&s;ed to make the di&s;|covery; he knowing it would be in vain to en|treat, or to urge any plea of the inju&s;tice &s;he was doing her &s;on, or to addre&s;s her tender feelings, he only peremptorily in&s;i&s;ted upon knowing the truth, as the only terms upon which he would keep the &s;ecret.</P>
<P>After a very long and ob&s;tinate re&s;i&s;tance, and making the future concealment of her &s;on the condition of her confe&s;&s;ion, &s;he informed him, that Lord Vincent was his father.</P>
<P>Mr. F&mdash;was elated with plea&s;ure at the pro&s;|pect of &s;eeing the noble youth, the darling of his hopes, &s;o happily placed; and, in&s;tead of ven|turing to let him remain where he then was, in another kingdom, he immediately &s;ent for him home, determined to keep him under his own eye till the time arrived when he &s;hould introduce
<PB N="126" REF="035640_0125_1006941BEB952290">
him to his father, le&s;t the machinations of lady Oakendale might fru&s;trate his de&s;ign. Nor were the&s;e apprehen&s;ions needle&s;s; for her lady&s;hip, having informed her faithful confidante of the re&s;ult of Mr. F&mdash;'s bu&s;ine&s;s, this artful woman in&s;tantly fore&s;aw the con&s;equences, and begged her lady&s;hip, as &s;he valued her reputation and peace of mind, to counteract the de&s;igns of Mr. F&mdash;; which &s;he thought might ea&s;ily be con|trived, by demanding to have an interview with her &s;on, in which Mr. F&mdash;might be pre&s;ent when her lady&s;hip &s;hould affect &s;o much fondne&s;s for her &s;on, that Mr. F&mdash;might be &s;o effectu|ally deceived, that he would be induced to in|tru&s;t him to her care; after which &s;he would en|gage to have him concealed.</P>
<P>Meantime Mr. F&mdash;recalled Eugene from France, and it &s;eemed now a proper time to in|troduce him to his mother. In con&s;equence of this plan, &s;o coincident with theirs, and &s;o well calculated to facilitate the de&s;igns of Marcel, Eu|gene was accordingly introduced to his mother in the pre&s;ence of Mr. F&mdash;; who, partial, in the highe&s;t degree, to the young man, could not &s;up|po&s;e, but when a mother beheld the off&s;pring of
<PB N="127" REF="035640_0126_1006941DAE430480">
her fonde&s;t love in the per&s;on of one of the fine&s;t figures nature ever formed, and animated by the mo&s;t intere&s;ting countenance that could adorn the human frame, her heart would undergo a change of &s;entiment, and a thou&s;and tender namele&s;s &s;en|&s;ations would betray the feelings of a mother. Nor was he quite mi&s;taken. Lady Oakendale, depraved as &s;he was, could not behold the capti|vating figure and manly beauty of his features, &s;oftened to a tenderne&s;s of expre&s;&s;ion at being in the pre&s;ence of a parent, without emotions to which &s;he had before been a &s;tranger; and when he threw him&s;elf at her feet, with the mo&s;t affec|tionate duty, a tear &s;tole down her cheek; and, pre&s;&s;ing him to her bo&s;om, &s;he had no occa&s;ion to have recour&s;e to di&s;&s;imulation to impre&s;s the ma|ternal embrace.</P>
<P>Her trembling voice could &s;carce articulate a &s;entence, and &s;he would have continued holding him to her heart, till the callous texture had been &s;oftened to the mo&s;t virtuous &s;en&s;ibility, had &s;he not been recalled to recollection by the interpo&s;i|tion of Marcel; who, ob&s;erving the &s;oft &s;en&s;a|tions which the &s;ight of her &s;on had in&s;pired, re|minded her of the dangerous con&s;equences that might attend her giving way to them; and lady
<PB N="128" REF="035640_0127_1006942286560A30">
Oakendale in&s;tantly re&s;umed her compo&s;ure, and &s;teadily pre&s;erved her purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Mr. F&mdash;&s;aw that &s;he had been &s;eriou&s;ly af|fected, and the &s;ight gave him infinite &s;atisfac|tion; but he could not entirely rely upon a cha|racter like her's, and happily &s;u&s;pecting that &s;he was, in &s;ome degree, acting a part, he would not therefore be per&s;uaded to leave Eugene with her; but promi&s;ing &s;he &s;hould &s;oon be indulged with another interview, he took him away, and lo&s;t no time in preparing his mind to expect the em|braces of a father al&s;o, though he did not yet think proper to inform him who he was.</P>
<P>Lord Vincent was now in Ireland, and Mr. F&mdash;impatiently waited his return to England, when he would re&s;tore him a &s;on every way wor|thy the honours of his hou&s;e and name; and from whom he expected Eugene would meet with a more &s;incere reception than he had received from his mother. He was at the &s;ame time particular|ly cautious to conceal Eugene, as much as po&s;&s;i|ble from the knowledge of lady Oakendale, till the time came when he &s;hould be &s;afe under the protection of Lord Vincent.</P>
<P><PB N="129" REF="035640_0128_1006942646E51748">
The lively di&s;po&s;ition of Eugene could but ill brook the re&s;traints impo&s;ed upon him by Mr. F&mdash;, and could not conceive any danger &s;hould ari&s;e from his going whither&s;oever his fancy led him.</P>
<P>He had one night been at Ranelagh, in order to amu&s;e his mind, which became oppre&s;&s;ed in the extreme, on account of never hearing any thing of his beloved Laura. He had written let|ter after letter, fraught with the tendere&s;t expre&s;|&s;ions of regard, and everla&s;ting con&s;tancy, all of which were intercepted by Mr. F&mdash;, for the rea&s;ons heretofore mentioned.</P>
<P>The horrid accounts every day received from Paris, filled his mind with the mo&s;t cruel appre|hen&s;ions; and, although he tried to divert his fears from &s;o melancholy a &s;ubject, by frequently running to places of public re&s;ort; yet he always returned with a double portion of wretchedne&s;s, as they only recalled back the remembrance of &s;imilar &s;cenes pa&s;t with his beloved Laura.</P>
<P>When he returned from Ranelagh the above mentioned evening, he was unhappy more than u&s;ual. He told Mr. F&mdash;he had been in com|pany with a gentleman who had given him &s;o
<PB N="130" REF="035640_0129_10069429EE91B8F0">
charming a de&s;cription of the Lakes in We&s;tmore|land and Cumberland, that if any thing could re|move his melancholy, and divert his imagination, it would be a vi&s;it to tho&s;e celebrated Lakes, and to rambling about that romantic and delightful country. Mr. F&mdash;thinking he might in &s;uch an excur&s;ion, be more out of the reach and pow|er of lady Oakendale, than he was by &s;taying in London, thought it be&s;t to make no oppo&s;ition to his reque&s;t; and Eugene, therefore, obtained leave to make a tour to the nothern part of En|gland, where, he &s;aid, he &s;hould find &s;ome young friends, with whom he had formed an intimacy at &s;chool. Mr. F&mdash;could not refu&s;e &s;o rea&s;on|able a reque&s;t, and imprudently &s;uffered him to depart without any attendant.</P>
<P>Having promi&s;ed to write very frequently, Eugene took an affectionate leave of Mr. F&mdash;, with no other weight upon his mind than that which aro&s;e from his being ignorant of the fate of Laura.</P>
<P>After a fortnight had elap&s;ed, and Mr. F&mdash;had heard not from Eugene, he began to be a|larmed. He took every method in his power to gain intelligence of him, but without effect. His
<PB N="131" REF="035640_0130_1006942D4C29A1D8">
mind underwent a tormenting &s;u&s;pen&s;e, for he really loved him like a &s;on; and, although he did not cha&s;e to inform lady Oakendale whither he was gone; yet &s;uch were his &s;u&s;picions of her, that he cau&s;ed &s;uch an application to be made to her as he thought might bring him &s;ome inform|ation; but all to no purpo&s;e; &s;he pleaded igno|rance of his de&s;tination and pretended great con|cern at the circum&s;tance.</P>
<P>Mr. F&mdash;&s;uffered the mo&s;t poignant grief; he accu&s;ed him&s;elf for allowing him to depart a|lone, and on this &s;core he endured many bitter reflections.</P>
<P>As time wore away, the &s;weet hope of pre&s;ent|ing a wi&s;hed for &s;on to a fond father, which &s;on ju&s;tified by his merit and accompli&s;hments, and even exceeded the mo&s;t &s;anguine hopes of the mo&s;t partial parent; the&s;e hopes, and flattering ideas, at length gave place to the bitter remem|brance of the lo&s;s each had &s;u&s;tained.</P>
<P>The continual adverti&s;ements he cau&s;ed to be in&s;erted in the daily papers, be&s;ides hand-bills, and every other inquiry which could lead to a di&s;covery, were ineffectually continued for many
<PB N="132" REF="035640_0131_1006942EEE0E8700">
months, without bringing him the &s;malle&s;t in|formation, or clue, to recover his favorite.</P>
<P>Fatigued with repeated di&s;appointments and not knowing what further methods to pur&s;ue, he waited upon Lord Vincent, the fir&s;t hour he heard he was arrived in England, informing that nobleman that he was a father; but that his mind was torn with perplexity as to the pre&s;ent exi&s;|tence of that &s;on, on who&s;e virtues and accom|pli&s;hments Mr. F&mdash;expatiated with the fond partiality of a parent.</P>
<P>Lord Vincent felt a glow of parental affection ri&s;e in his bo&s;om, which was every moment in|crea&s;ed on the recital of his merits, and &s;oon oc|ca&s;ioned an impatient de&s;ire of beholding him.</P>
<P>When Mr. F&mdash;mentioned his recent lo&s;s, Lord Vincent was firmly per&s;uaded that lady Oakendale was privy to the concealment; par|ticularly when Mr. F&mdash;informed him, that he &s;uffered Eugene to go alone; and that he had &s;ince his departure, di&s;covered that he had a pri|vate interview with lady Oakendale the night be|fore he &s;et out upon his tour, and informed her to what part of England he was going to make his excur&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="133" REF="035640_0132_10069433CC36DC90">
Per&s;uaded in this opinion, they debated upon the mea&s;ures to be pur&s;ued, which would be mo&s;t likely to bring her lady&s;hip to make the di&s;cove|ry. They agreed to begin by gentle methods, and treating with her by the mo&s;t friendly and &s;ecret per&s;ua&s;ions; and if this failed, to make more decided and arbitrary conditions.</P>
<P>In the meantime, and during the&s;e negocia|tions, Lord Oakendale's mind &s;uffered &s;o much painful unea&s;ine&s;s, as to produce a &s;low fever; he felt a cruel di&s;appointment at the lo&s;s of Laura, for whom he had conceived the mo&s;t ardent af|fection; and the manner of her di&s;appearance, together with the dreadful and unaccountable phantoms <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> Abbey, had &s;o much agitated his imagination, that it was &s;ometime before he could bring his rea&s;on to that &s;tate of compo&s;ure, which was nece&s;&s;ary in the projecting a &s;cheme he had planned for inve&s;tigating the horrors which had &s;o impo&s;ed upon his under&s;tanding at the Abbey.</P>
<P>He had formed and rejected many de&s;igns for this purpo&s;e, when lady Oakendale, before he adopted any, was &s;eized with a violent illne&s;s; the con&s;equence, (as Mr. F&mdash;&s;uppo&s;ed) of the
<PB N="134" REF="035640_0133_100694359F5B7F10">
negociation between her and Lord Vincent, con|cerning the concealment of Eugene.</P>
<P>Lord Oakendale &s;eldom gave him&s;elf much trouble about her, and her indi&s;po&s;itions were as little regarded as her&s;elf; but this became of a very &s;erious nature; and, upon his lord&s;hip's be|ing de&s;ired to attend her &s;ick bed-chamber, he obeyed the &s;ummons with unu&s;ual alacrity, &s;e|cretly hoping that he &s;hould not only be relea&s;ed from a bondage, from which he had never deriv|ed the &s;malle&s;t comfort or &s;atisfaction; but &s;hould yet be honorably ble&s;&s;ed with the hand of his char|ming Laura, could &s;he ever again be di&s;covered.</P>
<P>Elated with the&s;e hopes, he ha&s;tened to her apartment with no unplea&s;ing ideas; and, throw|ing an artful dejection into his countenance, he was approaching her bed with a tender expre&s;&s;ion of enquiry; when he &s;tarted, and was diverted from his purpo&s;e by the &s;urpri&s;e of beholding her with Lord Vincent on one &s;ide of the bed, and Mr. F&mdash;on the other, attended by a gen|tleman of the law taking notes from her confe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The moment &s;he beheld Lord Oakendale &s;he cea&s;ed &s;peaking. Her eye-lids fell, a &s;udden convul&s;ion affected her articulation, and &s;he had
<PB N="135" REF="035640_0134_1006943ADC2E33F0">
only time to pronounce, in a trembling voice and di&s;jointed words, "My&mdash;&s;on!&mdash;Oakendale Abbey!&mdash;" when &s;he &s;unk down and expired!</P>
<P>Lord Oakendale, much as he had wi&s;hed for her death, was &s;hocked at its &s;udden approach; and, not being able to comprehend the &s;cene be|fore him, and &s;till more a&s;toni&s;hed at her naming a &s;on, together with Oakendale Abbey, he de|manded of her faithful confidante, Marcel, "who was in the room?</P>
<P>"Why, Lord Vincent, and the other gentle|man, were pre&s;ent?</P>
<P>"And if her lady was in her right &s;en&s;es when &s;he talked of a &s;on, and Oakendale Abbey?"</P>
<P>The confu&s;ion of the &s;cene, and the &s;udden di&s;&s;olution of lady Oakendale, prevented every one pre&s;ent from giving an immediate an&s;wer; and Mr. F&mdash;&s;eeing Marcel in&s;tantly about to quit the room, in&s;tead of an&s;wering to the inter|rogatory of Lord Oakendale, he eagerly &s;eized her arm, and leading her up to his lord&s;hip, &s;aid, "There is much to be explained, my Lord, and I look upon this woman to be able to give the cleare&s;t account of the my&s;tery which yet remains
<PB N="135" REF="035640_0135_1006943DEF245C00">
unfolded; for this rea&s;on it &s;eems proper to have her &s;ecured."</P>
<P>Lord Vincent joined in this propo&s;ition; and, having collected proper a&s;&s;i&s;tance for the &s;ecurity of Marcel, the re&s;t of the party left the room of the decea&s;ed, and were joined by the gentleman of the law, who proceeded to read the minutes he had taken from her lady&s;hip's dying confe&s;&s;ion. They con&s;i&s;ted of a faithful relation of her being four months advanced in her pregnancy by Ed|ward Vincent, then an officer in the guards, at the time &s;he was married to Lord Oakendale.</P>
<P>That finding it impo&s;&s;ible to impo&s;e upon his lord&s;hip, by pretending the child to be his, &s;he confided her &s;ecret to Marcel; by who&s;e contriv|ance &s;he was in five months after her marriage delivered of a &s;on, at&mdash;in Buckingham&s;hire.</P>
<P>That this was managed the more ea&s;ily, on account of the ill terms upon which &s;he lived with her Lord.</P>
<P>That Marcel had engaged to &s;ecrete the child, and keep it at nur&s;e, which &s;he did, at a very little expence, till the end of five years; when the woman, who had taken the charge of it, told them "that he had been &s;tolen from her."</P>
<P><PB N="137" REF="035640_0136_1006944129F9CDC8">
That this circum&s;tance gave them no great un|ea&s;ine&s;s till about three years after, when Mr. F&mdash;declared him&s;elf to have been the per&s;on who had taken the child away, and from that time made large demands upon her for its educa|tion, always threatening her with a di&s;covery in ca&s;e of non-compliance.</P>
<P>That within the la&s;t two years Mr. F&mdash;had in&s;i&s;ted upon her &s;eeing the young man, and ex|torted a confe&s;&s;ion from her of his real father, to which, after great reluctance, &s;he yielded, and con&s;ented to &s;ee her &s;on. She confe&s;&s;ed, that the interview made her feel her&s;elf a mother; but the idea of his being introduced into the world as the &s;on and heir of Lord Vincent, filled her with perpetual alarm of a di&s;covery, and made her &s;uppre&s;s all her tender feelings, and again have recour&s;e to Marcel, to continue &s;ome method of &s;ecuring the pre&s;ervation of her fame, before Lord Vincent made a public acknowledgment of him as his &s;on. Various methods were &s;ugge&s;ted; but none &s;eemed proper to adopt, till the idea of travelling alone was artfully contrived to allure him from Mr. F&mdash;; and the gentleman, who
<PB N="138" REF="035640_0137_1006944301FB1480">
met him at Ranelagh, was by them engaged for the purpo&s;e of facilitating their de&s;ign; and hav|ing &s;o ordered, that his curio&s;ity &s;hould be excit|ed by the accounts of Oakendale Abbey, he was there entrapped, and &s;ecured in a &s;ubterrane|ous part of it, where, to the be&s;t of her know|ledge, he now remained.</P>
<P>This was the &s;ub&s;tance of lady Oakendale's confe&s;&s;ion; and an oath of confirmation was ad|mini&s;tered to her by the gentleman of the law, who was al&s;o a ju&s;tice of the peace. She found, however, her mind was not relieved by the con|fe&s;&s;ion, unle&s;s Lord Oakendale was made ac|quainted with her guilt, and would pronounce her pardon; and, being &s;en&s;ible that the hour was appoaching, when the mo&s;t ample confe&s;&s;ion would not le&s;&s;en her crimes whil&s;t one particle of di&s;&s;imulation remained, &s;he begged to &s;ee Lord Oakendale, declaring her intention of acknow|ledging her deception, and imploring his par|don; but the de&s;ign was &s;ufficient, and we hope accepted; &s;he was, therefore &s;pared the confu&s;ion of confe&s;&s;ing to him, whom &s;he had mo&s;t injured, by the Mini&s;ter of Death, who, on the moment
<PB N="139" REF="035640_0138_100694481B6D02E8">
of Lord Oakendale's approach, prevented her adding more than the above-mentioned words.</P>
<P>Having recovered their &s;urpri&s;e, and given ne|ce&s;&s;ary orders for the interment of her lady&s;hip, Lord Oakendale was equally de&s;irous with Lord Vincent to make the inve&s;tigation of Oakendale Abbey. He had no doubt but Laura had been entrapped, as well as Eugene; and the impatient de&s;ire he had of making her his wife, increa&s;ed his anxiety, and even po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him with the tor|ments of jealou&s;y, le&s;t Eugene, being in &s;imilar circum&s;tances with her&s;elf, might be captivated with her charms, and endeavor to make his e&s;cape with her. Stimulated with ideas of this nature, his mind was kept in a perpetual agitation, and his impatience would &s;carcely allow time for the nece&s;&s;ary preparations to be made for the journey, and to collect proper per&s;ons for &s;o arduous an undertaking.</P>
<P>Marcel would not, or could not, give them a|ny more information than what has been already related. She declared &s;he had never &s;een Oak|endale Abbey, although &s;he had rea&s;on to be|lieve that Eugene was at this time concealed there; &s;he was however, kept in clo&s;e cu&s;tody.</P>
<P><PB N="140" REF="035640_0139_10069449CFB174C0">
Lord Oakendale determined, that if Laura was found, no forms of ceremony &s;hould for an hour retard his marriage with her. He con&s;ider|ed the confe&s;&s;ion Lady Oakendale had made of her duplicity and infidelity a &s;ufficient relea&s;e from the marriage covenant; and which gave him full liberty to form a &s;econd union, long before the u&s;ual time of mourning was expired for the fir&s;t. It was not to be &s;uppo&s;ed he &s;hould be upon any terms of great cordiality with Lord Vincent; yet, as the pre&s;ent ca&s;e made him as intere&s;ted a per&s;on as him&s;elf in the projected di&s;covery, he allowed him&s;elf to wave all animo&s;ity for the pre|&s;ent, and to confer with Lord Vincent upon the plan of operation nece&s;&s;ary to be made upon the occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>At length the arrangements were all adju&s;ted, and a cho&s;en &s;et were appointed to accompany the two Lords, Mr. F&mdash;and the lawyer, into Cumberland, in order to di&s;cover both Eugene and Laura, and to era&s;e the Abbey to the ground, if it was nece&s;&s;ary to facilitate the &s;earch.</P>
<P>Lord Oakendale was elated with hope, and would allow no &s;ugge&s;tion to intrude that bore the mo&s;t di&s;tant idea to any circum&s;tance that was
<PB N="141" REF="035640_0140_1006944F4C88FC00">
not con&s;onant to his wi&s;hes. Laura, the charm|ing Laura, &s;hould now be lady Oakendale, and put in immediate po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all his wealth. Fan|cy had painted her with additional allurements; and her having been &s;o long confined in a &s;ubter|raneous abode, would render her more alive to freedom, and grateful for his &s;plendid offers. With the&s;e flattering hopes he endeavored to be|guile the tedious hours that intervened before the time fixed for their departure.</P>
<P>On the evening of the day before they were to begin their journey, he was indulging in one of the above delightful reveries, when a &s;ervant opened the door of his library, and informed him that a gentleman wi&s;hed to &s;peak with him upon bu&s;ine&s;s of importance, which could not be tru&s;ted to a me&s;&s;enger.</P>
<P>Lord Oakendale peevi&s;hly ordered him to be admitted, at the &s;ame time determining that no bu&s;ine&s;s what&s;oever &s;hould occa&s;ion a delay to the projected expedition. Accordingly a middle|aged clergyman was u&s;hered into the room, and, after the u&s;ual compliments had pa&s;&s;ed, he a&s;ked
<PB N="142" REF="035640_0141_100694514C0299A8">
Lord Oakendale "if he had any relation in the Ea&s;t-Indies?"</P>
<P>Lord Oakendale replied, "Yes, he had once a brother, whom, he believed, was &s;lain in battle in the Ea&s;t-Indies."</P>
<P>The gentleman who&s;e name was Martin, then proceeded to inform his lord&s;hip, "that a few weeks &s;ince he was called upon to attend one of his dying pari&s;hioners, who&s;e con&s;cience &s;eemed to labor under &s;ome very heavy oppre&s;&s;ion; and who &s;aid he had been on board a &s;hip coming to England from the Ea&s;t-Indies, when &s;he was tak|en by a French privateer. That there were &s;ev|eral pa&s;&s;engers on board, among&s;t whom was a little girl, who had a &s;mall bag of quilted &s;atin tied round her neck, which &s;he always held with great care, and con&s;equently he &s;uppo&s;ed con|tained &s;omething valuable. Indeed, he heard one of the women on board &s;ay that it did, and caution the child not to part with it. That he had frequently meditated to get it from her, but never had an opportunity till the day they were taken to the pri&s;on in Paris; when, &s;eeing one of the French &s;oldiers tearing it from the neck of the child, he per&s;uaded him that it was only a charm

again&s;t infection; and, by making &s;ome trifling exchange, &s;ecured the bag for his own. Upon opening it, he found it contained &s;ome jewels of value, carefully concealed, by being quilted be|tween the &s;atin. There was likewi&s;e a miniature picture of an officer, and a written paper, &s;igni|fying who the child was. The picture and the paper he pre&s;erved; but the jewels he &s;old, and found the money amounted to &s;ome hundred pounds.</P>
<P>The picture and the paper he always wi&s;hed to have re&s;tored to their right owners, and, upon the exchange of pri&s;oners, he made &s;ome enquiry af|ter the relations of the child; but, finding they were per&s;ons of con&s;equence, he was afraid to make any application to them, left it might lead to a di&s;covery of the theft. The time he &s;aid was now come, when he would give worlds never to have had them in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; nor could he re|collect one &s;ingle &s;atisfaction or plea&s;ure that the money for which the jewels &s;old had given him; that he &s;incerely repented having wronged the child; that he begged I would pray to God to forgive him; and all the re&s;titution he could now make, was to place the picture and the paper in my hands, be&s;eeching me, if po&s;&s;ible, to find out
<PB N="144" REF="035640_0143_10069458791553B8">
the child, or its relations, and to re&s;tore what yet remained of their property. He added, that he had lately met with a woman who had been taken pri&s;oner with the child, and who &s;aid it had been put on board, and intru&s;ted to her care by a female negro, who had lived with its parents; and that the child was carried from the pri&s;on by a &s;urgeon, of the name of du Frene, who attend|ed them. Mr. Martin having fini&s;hed his relation, Lord Oakendale tremblingly opened the paper. The fir&s;t thing that &s;truck his &s;ight was the picture of his brother; that brother upon whom he had be&s;towed &s;o little care or anxiety, and who&s;e ex|act re&s;emblance, now before his eyes, recalled to his recollection his many virtues, and filled his heart with remor&s;e and regret that he had &s;o cruelly neglected them, and paid &s;o little regard to his memory. Having paid this late tribute of affection, he proceeded to open the paper, which contained the following lines, written in his bro|ther's own hand:</P>
<LETTER>

</LETTER>
<P><PB N="145" REF="035640_0144_1006945DCE5E6FB0">
"This paper, picture and jewels, are the pro|perty of Laura Carleton."</P>
<P>No &s;ooner had Lord Oakendale read this paper than the colour for&s;ook his cheeks; his eyes gli&s;tened, and he held the paper in his trembling hand, while he pre&s;erved a profound &s;ilence. A fla&s;h of conviction ru&s;hed upon his mind that Lau|ra might be, and was in all probability his own niece; that Laura, whom he was upon the point of making his wife. He he&s;itated for a few &s;e|conds in the faint hope that &s;ome mi&s;take might prove the matter to be different; but the circum|&s;tances were too &s;trong to admit of any doubt; and however he might wi&s;h to di&s;believe the facts, an impul&s;e of a different nature from what he had hitherto experienced, made him &s;hudder for his own crimes, at the &s;ame time that he felt an un|common intere&s;t in the fate of Laura.</P>
<P>He again looked at his brother's picture: a|gain he examined the hand writing: it was cer|tainly his brother's, for it was a remarkable hard; and again it recalled to his remembrance the thou&s;and virtues which had marked his character, and the little value that had been placed upon
<PB N="146" REF="035640_0145_1006945F8C495AF0">
them by tho&s;e who &s;tood in the neare&s;t relation to him. Should Laura really be his neice, and the only &s;urviving branch of the hou&s;e of Oakendale, with what plea&s;ure &s;hould he allow her the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of that fortune, to which &s;he derived as much claim from her virtues, as from heriditary right!</P>
<P>Such are the ties of nature, that his pride ex|ulted in calling that woman niece, whom he had a &s;hort time before de&s;igned and &s;olicited for pro&s;|titution.&mdash;During the time the&s;e reflections were pa&s;&s;ing in his mind, he &s;at mu&s;ing without uttering a word: but at la&s;t recollecting Mr. Martin, he thanked him with unfeigned &s;incerity, and told him he had every rea&s;on to believe that he had &s;een the per&s;on, who exactly an&s;wered the de&s;crip|tion of the child, and whom he had no doubt was his neice.</P>
<P>He then proceeded to thank Mr. Martin for the trouble he had taken to convey the inform|ation to him: and, without telling him by what means &s;he came there, he added, that he verily believed &s;he was at this time concealed in an in|terior part of an old Abbey belonging to him&s;elf in Cumberland. That the next morning had
<PB N="147" REF="035640_0146_1006946381BCFA10">
been fixed for their journey there, to make an en|quiry which the pre&s;ent information he had re|ceived would greatly accellerate.</P>
<P>Mr. Martin congratulated Lord Oakendale on the pro&s;pect of finding his niece; and here it may not &s;eem improper to give our readers a more par|ticular account of Laura's father, in order more clearly to elucidate the identity of her birth.</P>
<P>We have already mentioned that Captain Wil|liam Carleton embarked with his regiment for the Ea&s;t Indies.</P>
<P>After being driven by contrary winds, they found them&s;elves cha&s;ed by an Algerine Cor&s;air.</P>
<P>The &s;pirit of the Engli&s;h determined to &s;tand an engagement, in which they were victorious, and very &s;oon boarded the Cor&s;air. On her way to Sallee, to pay the ran&s;om of her brother, who was a captive, there was a Greek Lady, of illu&s;t|rious birth, and exqui&s;ite beauty, and with her four female attendants, who were taken pri&s;oners. The gallantry of the Engli&s;h officer was exerted in acts of attention and con&s;olation to the fair Greeks, who, together with the riches of the car|go,
<PB N="148" REF="035640_0147_1006946686B64EB8">
made it a prize worthy the bravery of their nation.</P>
<P>The beauty of the chief captive who&s;e name was Zempronia, was the &s;ubject of univer&s;al ad|miration: and the captain of the ve&s;&s;el appropri|ated to her his cabin, and gave her every accom|modation that could render her &s;ituation &s;uch as to make her forget &s;he was his pri&s;oner: yet nothing could le&s;&s;en or &s;ooth her affliction: &s;he wept in|ce&s;&s;antly, and every effort of attention was only an&s;wered by the mo&s;t heart-rending &s;ighs and la|mentations: one of her attendants, about the age of &s;ixteen, appeared the lea&s;t unhappy. Her be|witching &s;miles, and captivating graces, fa&s;cinat|ed the heart of William Carleton; a &s;light wound he had received in the engagement &s;eemed to ex|cite all her pity, and &s;everal tender glances had betrayed a reciprocal pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>If the elegant per&s;on and accompli&s;hments of William had attracted the admiration of Zelima, he was no le&s;s enamoured of the fair Greek. She learned his language with facility; but in that of love &s;he was &s;till a greater proficient: and, by the time they arrived at the port of Grand Cana|ry, where they were to relea&s;e the lady and her

attendants, Zelima's heart was not le&s;s wounded than her lover's at the cruel idea of &s;eparation. She was charmed with all that he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. Her religion, her country, and her laws, were all &s;ac|rificed to the powerful pa&s;&s;ion of love; and an Engli&s;h prie&s;t, then re&s;iding at that port, tied the indi&s;&s;oluble knot.</P>
<P>She took leave of her mi&s;tre&s;s Zempronia with regret, but not with reluctance; all her duty, love and obedience, were alone due to her hu&s;|band; and &s;he attended her beloved William to the Ea&s;t, where her tender affection, and unremit|ting attention, rendered him the happie&s;t of men.</P>
<P>He wrote to Lord Oakendale an account of his marriage with the fair Grecian, and anticipated the plea&s;ure he &s;hould derive from pre&s;enting this lovely creature to his brother and &s;i&s;ter, when the conclu&s;ion of war &s;hould allow him to return to England; but Lord Oakendale made his marry|ing a &s;ervant a pretence for never an&s;wering any of his letters; and three years after, when the Honorable William Carleton's name appeared in the li&s;t of tho&s;e that were killed in battle, Lord Oakendale's heart only palpitated with a &s;ecret
<PB N="150" REF="035640_0149_1006946D5ED53428">
joy, that the many virtues, and univer&s;al good character of his brother, would no longer up|braid, and be a re&s;traint upon his own vices He put on the exterior of mourning; but he made no &s;ort of inquiry after the widow of William Carle|ton, or wi&s;hed to hear that he had left an inherit|or to his many virtues.</P>
<P>Thus were the ties of blood di&s;&s;olved, and a de&s;erted orphan left to &s;eek that protection from &s;trangers which &s;he had a right to claim from re|lations &s;o near to her. William Carleton had been a bad economi&s;t; he had a &s;mall younger brother's fortune, and his generous heart was too compa&s;&s;ionate, and too liberal, to his fellow crea|tures, to allow him to be affluent. He was, in|deed, too much engaged with his pre&s;ent felicity to make provi&s;ion for future misfortune, and he was killed by a random &s;hot in the moment of victory!</P>
<P>The fatal wound which deprived him of life was rendered &s;till more poignant by the reflection of leaving Zelima but ill-provided for. She, in|deed, did not experience the want of his atten|tion; for no &s;ooner were the fatal tidings brought her of William's death, than her heart &s;ickened,
<PB N="151" REF="035640_0150_1006946F0CDE8E40">
and &s;he only &s;urvived to ca&s;t a mournful look up|on the mangled corp&s;e of her hu&s;band, gave a convul&s;ive &s;hriek, and expired, leaving a female, infant "unpitied, and forlorn!"</P>
<P>Lord Oakendale threw off all remembrance of his brother with his mourning, and from that time never thought more of the connexion. He followed his plea&s;ures with unremitting avidity, till after the cour&s;e of a few years, when his con|&s;titution began to warn him by frequent intima|tions that the career, in which he was &s;o deeply engaged, would &s;ome day be interrupted.</P>
<P>In the&s;e moments of admonition he wi&s;hed for he knew not what comforts and re&s;ources; real friends he had none. The tender endearments of a family he had never known, and his heart felt an aching void for tho&s;e dear attentions and &s;oli|citudes, which can only be experienced from the tendere&s;t ties.</P>
<P>In the&s;e irk&s;ome hours, the death of lady Oak|endale was his ultimate wi&s;h, and opened to his fancy an inviting path, when he might be at li|berty to marry &s;ome beautiful young creature, without fortune, who&s;e gratitude would &s;ecure to him her affections, and who&s;e youth and health
<PB N="152" REF="035640_0151_10069473EBAB36E8">
would in&s;ure heirs to his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. But at the time the&s;e wi&s;hes were formed his hopes were vain; for lady Oakendale was then by no means likely to give him &s;uch a chance. Her health was her fir&s;t care, and, to an excellent con&s;titu|tion &s;he added the mo&s;t &s;tudious attention to its pre&s;ervation, living by rule, and &s;tudying the whole vocabulary of whole&s;omes. Neither did her pre&s;ent conduct afford him any other hope of breaking the marriage fetters; for amid&s;t the few virtues &s;he did po&s;&s;e&s;s, &s;he adhered &s;trictly to that of cha&s;tity, allowing no kind of mercy to tho&s;e who had been only &s;u&s;pected to have violated the marriage vow.</P>
<P>Such were Lord and lady Oakendale; when the former, finding his life every day more unhappy, and viewing the infirmities of old age at no great di&s;tance from him, he endeavored to beguile the tedious length of the &s;ummer-days, by vi&s;iting different water places, which were &s;ituated in the mo&s;t unfrequented and ob&s;cure parts of England, where he went by another name, in order to fol|low his favorite propen&s;ities; &s;o that, when he returned to London, and again a&s;&s;umed his name and character as a &s;enator, he might condemn tho&s;e vices he had not only been practi&s;ing him|&s;elf,
<PB N="153" REF="035640_0152_10069477AF4B50A8">
but &s;educing the innocent and unwary to fall into.</P>
<P>It was during the la&s;t &s;ummer that he had made an excur&s;ion to an interior part of South Wales; from whence his fancy led him to Milford-Haven, where, as he was one evening &s;trolling near the &s;ea, he accidentally met with Laura, the uncom|mon charms of who&s;e per&s;on attracted his notice, and he &s;oon formed a plan of becoming acquaint|ed with her, which &s;ucceeding, he in a &s;hort time, found him&s;elf violently attached.</P>
<P>Her beauty was the lea&s;t of her merit, and a certain refinement and delicacy which pervaded her whole manner, checked the licentious im|pul&s;es which the charms of her per&s;on occa&s;ioned, and he found it nece&s;&s;ary to be more upon his guard, and to act with more circum&s;pection in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, than any he had ever before encountered.</P>
<P>Her &s;en&s;ible conver&s;ation, the ob&s;ervations &s;he had made upon the world, as far as &s;he had &s;een it, would have made her an entertaining compa|nion, had no other charms captivated his &s;en&s;es; but, alluring as &s;he was both in mind and per&s;on, he found it impo&s;&s;ible to re&s;i&s;t &s;o engaging an ob|ject:
<PB N="154" REF="035640_0153_1006947AFA8F8038">
he therefore di&s;covered as much as he could of her &s;tory, and found her chief misfortune, and which &s;he mo&s;t lamented, was the lo&s;s of a lady who had brought her up, and from whom &s;he was divided in her pa&s;&s;age from France.</P>
<P>Having gathered thus much from her own ac|count, he concluded &s;he was the natural daughter of Mon&s;ieur du Frene, who had pre&s;ented her to his wife as a foundling; that Mon&s;ieur was dead, and in all probability &s;he would never again &s;ee Madame.</P>
<P>From the&s;e circum&s;tances he con&s;idered her as a lawful prize for him, and would have immedi|ately offered her a &s;ettlement as a mi&s;tre&s;s, had not a certain dignity, and mode&s;t &s;uperiority in her manner, awed his freedom, and prevented his making &s;uch a propo&s;al. He was, however, de|termined not to lo&s;e her, and therefore formed the plan of enticing her to London, under pre|tence of placing her with a &s;i&s;ter till &s;he &s;hould di&s;cover Madame du Frene.</P>
<P>His in&s;inuating manners and addre&s;s &s;oon gain|ed upon the un&s;u&s;picious heart of Laura; &s;he con|&s;idered him as old enough to be her father; but for that rea&s;on he was &s;till better calculated to
<PB N="155" REF="035640_0154_10068EFD49F4FEF8">
be her friend, and &s;he was charmed with the pro|po&s;al of placing her with his &s;i&s;ter. She felt ven|eration and e&s;teem for Mr. Thoranby (the name he had a&s;&s;umed) and it was not till &s;he arrived in London that &s;he di&s;covered the whole of his de|ception, which, when he endeavored to palliate and excu&s;e by pleading the mo&s;t ardent love, &s;he &s;olemnly vowed to &s;acrifice her life to her honor; and, as we have before ob&s;erved, he &s;ent her to Oakendale Abbey, in hopes that the &s;olitude of the place would induce her to lend a more favor|able ear to his wi&s;hes.</P>
<P>How did the retro&s;pection of this part of his conduct now fill the mind of Lord Oakendale with corroding thoughts! A ray of gratitude to the Supreme Ruler of all events, who had not permitted him to commit a crime at which his &s;oul &s;huddered, diffu&s;ed over him &s;en&s;ations to which he had hitherto been a &s;tranger. He made an ample confe&s;&s;ion to Mr. Martin of all his conduct, and lamented his errors in &s;uch terms of contrition and penitence, that Mr. Martin gave him all po&s;&s;ible con&s;olation, and readily joined the party, who were waiting to make the pro|jected &s;earch at Oakendale Abbey; to which
<PB N="156" REF="035640_0155_10069482B3572488">
place their journey was completed as expeditiou&s;|ly as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>On their arrival at Oakendale, every thing re|mained in the &s;tate they had left it; and no ve&s;t|ige of any human being appeared to have trav|er&s;ed its gloomy apartments. They proceeded to the room which had, on more occa&s;ions than one, cau&s;ed &s;o much terror, being now a very &s;trong party, properly armed, and every way deter|mined to inve&s;tigate the my&s;tery.</P>
<P>Lord Oakendale him&s;elf led the way. The virtuous principle upon which he now &s;earched for Laura, actuated his mind with a manly re&s;o|lution; and he felt none of tho&s;e perturbed trem|blings which had a&s;&s;ailed his heart on a former occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>In one hand he firmly gra&s;ped a pi&s;tol, in the other a &s;hort &s;word; and having excited his at|tendants boldly to follow his example, whatever they might encounter, he proceeded into the cloi&s;ter.</P>
<P><PB N="157" REF="035640_0156_10069486ABA87F98">
All was &s;till and &s;ilent, and by force they made their way into the room which terminated it. It was totally dark, and they were obliged to light their candles before they could even di&s;tin|gui&s;h each other!</P>
<P>As &s;oon as they were a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the lights, they perceived that the windows, through which very little light could have been admitted, were entirely &s;topped up, and this &s;eemed to have been done very lately.</P>
<P>Lord Oakendale was convinced it was the very &s;ame apartment he had been in before; but eve|ry thing now bore a different a&s;pect! nothing appeared in the room but a large table, and &s;ome loo&s;e boards. There were evident marks of blood upon many parts of the floor, and in one corner lay a human &s;cull! Lord Oakendale &s;huddered! The idea of Laura and murder trembled in his heart; at the &s;ame time that it renewed his cou|rage, and animated his pur&s;uit. "We will pro|ceed," &s;aid he, "and inve&s;tigate this accur&s;ed my&s;tery, or die in the attempt."</P>
<P>"The &s;cull cannot be Laura's" &s;aid Mr. F&mdash;;"it could not have been in this &s;tate from the time
<PB N="158" REF="035640_0157_100694884E30D3E8">
&s;he has been mi&s;&s;ing;" yet it might be Eugene's, and the thought re&s;ted upon his imagination with a &s;ickening horror!</P>
<P>Lord Oakendale, having &s;earched every part of the room to no purpo&s;e, ordered the floor to be taken up; when, as the men were beginning to execute his orders, they di&s;covered a trap-door, which was in&s;tantly opened, and they de&s;cended down &s;everal winding &s;teps into a huge vault, which &s;eemed to extend under the church. They lighted more candles, and left no part un&s;earched. No object pre&s;ented it&s;elf; but they picked up bones and &s;culls in various parts of the vault.</P>
<P>Lord Oakendale fired his pi&s;tol; nothing re|turned but the vibration of its &s;ound; after which a perfect &s;tillne&s;s was ob&s;erved, and a deep hol|low groan arre&s;ted the ears of every one pre&s;ent. They turned to the left, from whence the &s;ound of the groan proceeded, and perceiving a hollow arch, they advanced towards it; but could only be admitted &s;ingly, as the &s;ides were too clo&s;e, and the roof too low to &s;tand upright in.</P>
<P>Lord Oakendale &s;till led the way, and the re&s;t followed. He had again charged his pi&s;tol, and
<PB N="159" REF="035640_0158_1006948DB62081A0">
he carried his &s;word and a candle in the other hand.</P>
<P>Having advanced &s;everal paces, &s;omething was thrown in his eyes by an invi&s;ible hand, and for a moment he was in total darkne&s;s! He again fired his pi&s;tol; and as &s;oon as the &s;ound cea&s;ed, a faint voice exclaimed, "O God, my deliver|ance is at hand!" The re&s;t of the lights came up, and di&s;covered a hedious figure of a man, with an uplifted bar of iron in his hand ready to &s;trike a fatal blow on the fir&s;t per&s;on who advanced. He was in&s;tantly &s;eized, and made to deliver the keys of a grate which opened to a very &s;mall room.</P>
<P>Having &s;ecured the man, and entered the pri|&s;on, in one corner of it appeared an emaciated figure, altered indeed; but in who&s;e thin and pallid countenance Mr. F&mdash;in&s;tantly recogni|zed the features of his dear Eugene! He flew to embrace and to pre&s;ent him to Lord Vincent; whil&s;t Lord Oakendale felt him&s;elf di&s;appointed, and involuntarily exclaimed, "Where is my Laura!"</P>
<P>At the name of Laura, Eugene, whom the &s;ur|prize and the joy of the &s;cene had till then rend|ered
<PB N="160" REF="035640_0159_100694FAC8BB4290">
&s;peechle&s;s, replied, "Laura! What Laura! Can &s;he be in this place of horror?"</P>
<P>"This is no time for explanation," &s;aid Mr. F&mdash;; "let us return to the le&s;s gloomy parts of the Abbey; and as the man, who guarded this infernal dungeon, is &s;ecured we may proba|bly force him to a confe&s;&s;ion of what we &s;till fur|ther wi&s;h to know; in the mean time let us, my dear boy, give you all the a&s;&s;i&s;tance in our power; and revive you by &s;ome immediate refre&s;hment."</P>
<P>Eugene, altered and oppre&s;&s;ed by the cruel confinement he had &s;o long &s;uffered appeared &s;carcely the &s;ame; yet &s;till a &s;mile of grateful ac|knowledgment to tho&s;e who had &s;o unexpectedly procured his enlargement, prejudiced them all in his favor; and the pro&s;pect of liberty, toge|ther with the joy of beholding the faces of tho&s;e whom he knew to be his friends, animated his eyes, and gave a glow to his pale cheeks.</P>
<P>Lord Vincent pre&s;&s;ed him to his bo&s;om, and acknowledged him for his &s;on; and, although his whole appearance bore te&s;timony to his wretched condition, yet an open countenance, and manly deportment, di&s;tingui&s;hed the graces of his per|&s;on, and his &s;entiments, &s;uch as he was able to ex|pre&s;s,
<PB N="161" REF="035640_0160_10068F20D7B6D4D0">
did credit to, and confirmed the educa|cation which the good Mr. F&mdash;had be&s;towed on him.</P>
<P>Being returned to the other apartments, Lord Oakendale a&s;ked Eugene, in a melancholy tone of voice, if he had, during his confinement, ever &s;een or heard of a young lady in the Abbey?"</P>
<P>Eugene replied "that he had not." He &s;aid, "on the day he had gained the keys of the Abbey, he thought to amu&s;e him&s;elf with ob&s;erving the &s;tructure of the rooms, without &s;uppo&s;ing that a|ny human beings, be&s;ides him&s;elf were within|&s;ide of it. The inhabitants of Oakendale, and particularly the man from whom he had the keys, had told him of gho&s;ts and &s;pectres;&mdash;but this made him only the more eager to reconnoitre the place; and not being the lea&s;t apprehen&s;ive of any &s;upernatural cau&s;es, he fearle&s;&s;ly walked about the rooms, in which he &s;aw nothing either to engage his attention, or excite his fears; till at la&s;t coming into one of the rooms on the fir&s;t floor, he was attracted by a portrait, not in very good pre&s;ervation, but who&s;e features and coun|tenance bore &s;o &s;triking a re&s;emblance to Laura,
<PB N="162" REF="035640_0161_10068F24417AE800">
that he was fixed to the &s;pot, and &s;tood gazing at it with &s;urpri&s;e and admiration.</P>
<P>"He had ju&s;t taken from his pocket a &s;mall letter-ca&s;e, in which was a little &s;ketch he had him&s;elf attempted upon vellum, of the &s;weete&s;t features in the world; and was examining and comparing the likene&s;s, when he heard foot&s;teps, and in&s;tantly found him&s;elf pinioned down and &s;ecured. All re&s;i&s;tance was in vain, and he was hurried down to the grated room in the vault from whence they had now &s;o happily relea&s;ed him; and where he was only &s;upplied with com|mon nece&s;&s;aries, debarred of light, and every &s;ocial comfort.</P>
<P>"He had" he &s;aid, "during his confinement, &s;een many different faces in the per&s;ons who guarded him, and brought his provi&s;ions, and each were uniformly &s;ilent to the que&s;tions he con&s;tantly put, in order to gain information of the place he was in, and their de&s;igns. Once he had attempted to e&s;cape, but was only more clo&s;ely guarded afterwards. He had heard &s;trange noi&s;es, and had rea&s;on to believe that &s;ome &s;ecret practices were carried on in the Abbey; but of what nature he could not give the mo&s;t di&s;tant
<PB N="163" REF="035640_0162_10068F2762CF6080">
gue&s;s. His &s;pirits had &s;unk to a degree of wretch|edne&s;s pa&s;t all de&s;cription at the idea of never gaining his liberty, and his mind had given way to the mo&s;t cruel de&s;pair, when he was rou&s;ed only to a kind of callous indifference upon the re|port of the fir&s;t pi&s;tol; but when he heard the &s;econd fired, and &s;aw through the grate that the guard was agitated, and gathered up the du&s;t to throw at &s;ome object which appeared with a light, he felt a ray of comfort to which he had long been a &s;tranger, and which he had &s;o joyfully experienced by his enlargement."</P>
<P>The next &s;tep was to interrogate the guard, who, after an ob&s;tinate &s;ilence, &s;aid, "That he was hired for the purpo&s;e of guarding the grate, and was relieved in the office by another, who was &s;omewhere about the Abbey." But, after many promi&s;es and threatnings of future rewards and puni&s;hments, and, after having ab&s;olutely di&s;claimed the knowledge of any other per&s;on being confined in the Abbey, he confe&s;&s;ed, "he had been hired by a &s;et of people, who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s it was to &s;teal dead bodies, and bring them to the Abbey for defection; that there was a private door from the church-yard into the cloi&s;ter, where they u&s;ed to be brought and depo&s;ited in the room
<PB N="164" REF="035640_0163_10068F2A6C927238">
which they had partitioned off for the purpo&s;e, and which has before been de&s;cribed; that the bo<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">es were afterwards thrown into the vault from the trap door; that this had been a practice for many years; and, by having the range of the Abbey, they had taken care to pre&s;erve it for them&s;elves by taking methods to frighten, and effectually keep away every gue&s;t that made any attempt to inhabit it." He added, moreover, "that they frequently procured bodies that were hanged at, or near Carli&s;le; and that a man, who was hanged for murder in the neighborhood, and who&s;e body was brought there, and ha&s;tily de|po&s;ited in an ob&s;cure room, had as was &s;uppo&s;ed, returned to life, and made his e&s;cape; for on two men going at midnight to fetch him upon a board to the di&s;&s;ecting room, they found him gone, and in his place a young lady, who had &s;unk into a fit with terror upon their approach, and whom he believed they conveyed to a hut in the village. That &s;ome daring adventurers had lately broke in upon them; but their appearance had, as he &s;uppo&s;ed, terrified them from pro|ceeding in their attempts; but, from the time, of the young man's being a pri&s;oner there, and their
<PB N="165" REF="035640_0164_10068F2DC89AE180">
having been pretty much alarmed, they had thought it mo&s;t prudent to take away their im|plements till the young man was either removed or relea&s;ed. That he did not believe any per&s;on had ever been murdered there, though many bo|dies had been brought from places both near and di&s;tant, and many &s;keletons had been depo&s;ited in different parts of the Abbey, as well to alarm tho&s;e who might &s;ee them, as to pre&s;erve them; and whenever any per&s;on came to &s;tay there, they took care to whi&s;per in the pa&s;&s;ages, and make other noi&s;es, to prevent their remaining in the Abbey. That he remembered hearing one of the gentlemen, he called his ma&s;ter, &s;ay he alarm|ed a lady, by coming through a trap-door into a gallery where &s;he was walking by moon-light, though he believed &s;he only &s;aw his &s;hadow."</P>
<P>Thus was this great my&s;tery at once explain|ed, and the gho&s;ts of Oakendale Abbey were in|deed the dead; but brought thither by tho&s;e unfeeling mon&s;ters of &s;ociety, who make a prac|tice of &s;tealing our friends, and relations from the peaceful grave where their a&s;hes, as we &s;up|po&s;e, are depo&s;ited in re&s;t!</P>
<P><PB N="166" REF="035640_0165_10068F313B28CA68">
The next enquiry to be made, was that of knowing by who&s;e orders Eugene was entrapped in the Abbey; but of this the pre&s;ent informer could give no intelligence.</P>
<P>Lord Oakendale que&s;tioned him very clo&s;ely concerning the lady whom the men had convey|ed to the hut in &s;o alarming a &s;tate; but this man could give no further account of her than he had already mentioned; and all that could be ga|thered was, that the time, in which he &s;aid it happened, corre&s;ponded exactly with that in which Laura was mi&s;&s;ing from the Abbey.</P>
<P>Lord Oakendale was unhappy. The thoughts of Laura, and what might be her fate, engro&s;&s;ed all his attention; nor was Eugene le&s;s anxious on the &s;ame &s;core. The idea of her being confi|ned in the Abbey with him&s;elf, filled his mind with a romantic extravagance of fancy, that they mu&s;t be de&s;tined for each other.</P>
<P>The wild &s;allies of his imagination, or the more &s;erious and pen&s;ive &s;entiments, which ex|hibited a mind formed for every noble purpo&s;e, charmed Lord Vincent; whil&s;t Lord Oakendale viewed him with a kind of &s;ullen hauteur, which
<PB N="167" REF="035640_0166_10068F3532B965B8">
might be well accounted for by the circum&s;tan|ces of his birth; yet, when Eugene con&s;idered him as the uncle of his Laura, a thou&s;and att n|tive a&s;&s;iduities were offered to his &s;ervices; and it was with difficulty Lord Vincent could prevail upon him to accompany him back to London, in order to be introduced as his &s;on and heir. His heart dwelt upon the di&s;covery of Laura and he would have given worlds to have been deputed the chief employer in &s;uch an inve&s;tigation.</P>
<P>Duty to his father at length prevailed, and he reluctantly bid adieu to Lord Oakendale, who was determined to &s;tay in the neighborhood of Oakendale, being per&s;uaded that Laura was &s;ome|where concealed in its vicinity; and he offered large rewards to any per&s;on who &s;hould bring him intelligence of her abode.</P>
<P>He likewi&s;e &s;et on foot a pro&s;ecution, and an order to apprehend, or cau&s;e to be apprehended, tho&s;e wretches who had, for &s;o many years, been the terror of Oakendale, and by their diabolical practices made the Abbey be con&s;idered the re|ceptacle for evil &s;pirits. But all his exertions on this &s;core proved fruitle&s;s; the perpetrators of
<PB N="168" REF="035640_0167_10068F9C868547F0">
the&s;e acts taking care to &s;ecure them&s;elves be|yond the reach of ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>Meantime Laura enjoyed, with Mrs. Greville, all the comforts, as well as elegancies, for which &s;he &s;eemed by nature calculated.</P>
<P>The amu&s;ements, which filled up her time, &s;erved, in &s;ome degree, to drive from her mind tho&s;e gloomy ideas, which, when indulged by indolent mu&s;ings, never fail to dive&s;t the mind of its proper energy, and to ca&s;t a &s;hade of melan|choly di&s;content upon every object. Her fancy, indeed, would &s;ometimes wander back to pa&s;t &s;cenes, and recollection would exhibit the youth|ful hours when, with her dear Eugene, &s;he pa&s;|&s;ed whole days, delighted and beloved, uncon|&s;cious of the evil that awaited her, and of tho&s;e many dark hours which had &s;ucceeded them; that Eugene &s;hould never have made any inquiry, or &s;ent one letter to her before &s;he left France, was what &s;he could not place to any account but that of her evil de&s;tiny; it was &s;trange and unexpect|ed; yet &s;he was &s;ure his heart was faithful, and &s;ome untoward accident had been the cau&s;e why two hearts, &s;o firmly united, and formed for each
<PB N="169" REF="035640_0168_10068F9F747AA588">
other, were now &s;o totally divided and torn a|&s;under.</P>
<P>The&s;e were &s;ad reflections, and &s;he indulged them as little as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>As the &s;pring advanced, Mrs. Greville &s;hewed her many beautiful parts of the country, and they were vi&s;ited by the di&s;tant neighbors. Sir George and lady Orland were expected; and Laura, though &s;he knew not why, felt a cheering hope as the time approached. At length the evening arrived, which brought Sir George and his lady to the Grove. Mrs. Greville pre&s;ented Laura to them as a very valuable acqui&s;ition, which for|tune had be&s;towed upon her &s;ince &s;he la&s;t &s;aw them.</P>
<P>After the u&s;ual &s;alutations and compliments, lady Orland &s;tept back, and led in a lady, &s;aying, "I have likewi&s;e an acqui&s;ition to introduce to you;" when Laura, turning her eyes to the lady as &s;he advanced, they were fa&s;cinated with the &s;ight of her dear and ever-valued Madame du Frene. The joy was mutual, and they ru&s;hed into each others arms with unfeigned tran&s;ports of delight.</P>
<P><PB N="170" REF="035640_0169_1006948FACE92970">
Lady Orland had received Madame Du Frene into the hou&s;e in the capacity of a governe&s;s to her only daughter; and &s;he had di&s;covered &s;o ma|ny amiable traits in her character, and her whole conduct and deportment had been &s;o uniformly calculated for the tru&s;t repo&s;ed in her, that lady Orland never wi&s;hed to con&s;ider her in any light, but that of a polite and accompli&s;h|ed vi&s;itor; and had given her &s;o many proofs of her friend&s;hip and regard, as gave her every rea|&s;on to forget &s;he was an emigrant. Madame Du Frene had frequently mentioned and lamented the fate of her beloved Laura, and her joy was now completed in finding her under the protection of the worthy Mrs. Greville.</P>
<P>After having related to each other their various adventures &s;ince the time of their &s;eparation, Ma|dame du Frene told Laura, that in one of the emi|grants, whom chance had thrown in her way to London, &s;he had met with the woman, to who&s;e care Laura was intru&s;ted, in her voyage from In|dia; that &s;he was now &s;ervant at a hotel in Lon|don, was ready to give any te&s;timony concerning her charge as far as &s;he knew; but &s;he was in dai|ly expectation of a brother from the Ea&s;t-Indies,
<PB N="171" REF="035640_0170_10069493316441B0">
who would bring a more particular account of the name and parents of Laura, as &s;he had &s;ent him word of her having been taken pri&s;oner, and &s;tripped of every thing that could direct her to find her relations.</P>
<P>Laura's heart glowed with gratitude to Provi|dence for having &s;o miraculou&s;ly pre&s;erved her, and rai&s;ed her up friends in a country, where as yet &s;he had no knowledge of &s;uch a claim; and &s;he doubted not but the di&s;pen&s;ations of his all|ruling power would enable her to find &s;ome being to whom &s;he could prove her kindred, and pay that filial duty with which her heart overflowed.</P>
<P>Thus was Laura &s;ituated during the tran&s;ac|tions that had been pa&s;&s;ing at Oakendale Abbey.</P>
<P>The &s;ociety at Mrs. Greville's wanted not any addition. If the idea of Eugene &s;ometimes cro&s;|&s;ed the fancy of Laura with a painful &s;en&s;ation, &s;he &s;uppre&s;&s;ed even the &s;igh which the memory of pa&s;t &s;cenes, and the conviction that they would not return, would occa&s;ion; for &s;he knew that the happine&s;s of this world mu&s;t admit of much alloy, and her pre&s;ent &s;ituation was &s;uch, that &s;he had no other cau&s;e for regret.</P>
<P><PB N="172" REF="035640_0171_1006949682B39EB0">
Meantime Lord Oakendale was indefatigable in his endeavors to recover his niece, and had at la&s;t received the plea&s;ing intelligence that &s;he was at Mrs. Greville's. He lo&s;t not a moment to go there, charmed with the knowledge that &s;he was under &s;uch a re&s;pectable protection.</P>
<P>It was after one &s;ultry day that Laura, with the re&s;t of Mrs. Greville's family, were &s;itting near the point of a rock, contemplating the pro&s;|pect which commanded the view of a beautiful lake. She was reflecting upon her happy &s;itua|tion, and only indulging one fearful and di&s;tant wi&s;h for a certain object ever dear to her remem|brance, when a &s;ervant, addre&s;&s;ing Mrs. Greville, announced Lord Oakendale.</P>
<P>Laura &s;tarted, and &s;creaming, &s;aid, "Ah! hide me, hide me, from that wicked man!"</P>
<P>"Fear nothing, my love," &s;aid Mrs. Greville; "you have friends here &s;ufficient to protect you, and Sir George will wait upon his lord&s;hip to know his bu&s;ine&s;s."</P>
<P>Sir George in&s;tantly aro&s;e to obey his aunt, and promi&s;ed Laura that &s;he &s;hould never be car|ried from them whil&s;t he had an arm to defend her. He in&s;tantly left them, and Laura kept clinging
<PB N="173" REF="035640_0172_1006949A8962DCD0">
to Madame du Frene when they perceived Lord Oakendale and Sir George advancing towards them.</P>
<P>Laura trembled, but was determined to &s;um|mon up courage to &s;upport and exert her&s;elf, when Lord Oakendale flew to embrace her with the appellation of "my deare&s;t niece."</P>
<P>Laura &s;tood amazed, and fancied that her or|gans of hearing deceived her, or that Lord Oak|endale was practi&s;ing &s;ome new deception; but when he &s;tood for a moment in &s;ilent admiration, and &s;he &s;aw the tears roll down his manly cheeks, a &s;ympathetic tear relieved her bo&s;om, and a &s;e|cret impul&s;e chaced away her fears. Lord Oak|endale, in a few words, explained the my&s;tery; and &s;he had the inexpre&s;&s;ible felicity of embracing an uncle.</P>
<P>Lord Oakendale pre&s;&s;ed her to his bo&s;om with parental fondne&s;s; and drawing from thence a miniature, &s;u&s;pended by a ribband, he held it to Laura, &s;aying, "Behold your father's ju&s;t re&s;em|blance in this picture, which was torn from thy infant neck by ruffians; yet pre&s;ented by thy penitent uncle."</P>
<P><PB N="174" REF="035640_0173_1006949E574759C0">
Laura received it with joy, and &s;he knelt to her uncle with filial love and obedience. Hap|pine&s;s was every where diffu&s;ed around, and her heart glowed with laudable pride when Lord Oakendale thanked Mrs. Greville for her un|bounded kindne&s;s to his niece, Laura Carleton, for &s;uch he had no doubt &s;he was; he therefore pa&s;&s;ed a few days at Mrs. Greville's, in joys to which he had hitherto been a &s;tranger; for al|though he was now near fifty years of age, he had ever been debarred from the felicity of dome&s;tic &s;ociety. He found Laura (when &s;he was dive&s;ted of fear and embarra&s;&s;ment) a charming companion. When &s;he related her hi&s;tory and &s;ufferings, he could not &s;ufficiently admire her &s;trength of mind, her re&s;olution, and above all, her re&s;ignation. In &s;hort, he perfectly doted on her; and lo&s;t no time in &s;ending for the te&s;timony of the woman's brother, who had brought her over, and of whom Madame du Frene had &s;poken. The man was lately arrived, and brought with him a duplicate of the paper Mr. Martin had before delivered to Lord Oakendale, written in his brother's own hand.</P>
<P>Madame du Frene was ready to affirm, that Lau|ra was the identical child her hu&s;band had brought from the French pri&s;on; but, be&s;ides all this te&s;|timony,
<PB N="175" REF="035640_0174_1006949FFA15ACB8">
Laura's own remembrance and account furni&s;hed the &s;tronge&s;t proof. The confirmation was beyond a doubt; and if there had been any remaining te&s;timony wanting from coincidence of circum&s;tances, the uncommon likene&s;s &s;he bore not only to her father, but to the picture of her grandmother, which had &s;o attracted poor Eu|gene in Oakendale Abbey, was proof &s;ufficient; and the fondne&s;s which Lord Oakendale felt for the only off&s;pring of his family, wanted no cor|roborating te&s;timony that their blood flowed from the &s;ame &s;ource. Indeed when he looked back upon the &s;trange events which had brought them together, and made known their affinity, he ble&s;|&s;ed the hand of heaven which had &s;o miraculou&s;ly &s;aved him from one of the wor&s;t of crimes. And as he gazed <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> un&s;peakable fondne&s;s, on the fair form of his lovely niece, he con&s;idered her as a rich ble&s;&s;ing &s;ent to comfort the remainder of his days here; and by working a reformation in his conduct, to give him hopes for tho&s;e of hereafter.</P>
<P>Lord Oakendale te&s;tified his mo&s;t grateful ac|knowledgements to Madame du Frene for her ma|ternal care of Laura, and to who&s;e good in&s;truc|tions he placed the uncommon merit &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. When he gave a recital of the &s;earch which he
<PB N="176" REF="035640_0175_100694A52B840F78">
had made to inve&s;tigate the my&s;tery of Oakendale Abbey, he engaged the fixed attention of his auditors; but when he came to give the account of finding Eugene, and of his long confinement in the dreary vault, the de&s;cription he gave of his per&s;on and manners, convinced Laura that it could be no other than her dear Eugene; the reci|tal of who&s;e cruel impri&s;onment and &s;ufferings, &s;oftened her heart with the tendere&s;t pity, and rendered him &s;till more dear.</P>
<P>When Lord Oakendale mentioned the poor emaciated figure in the grated room, whom Mr. F&mdash;called Eugene, Laura aro&s;e with great emotion, and expre&s;&s;ed a trembling impatience for the conclu&s;ion of a fate in which &s;he was &s;o nearly intere&s;ted. Lord Oakendale took but little notice of her perturbation; he would not allow his heart for a moment to admit the idea of an union with Eugene. Whatever might be his merits, a &s;omething, relating, no doubt, to his birth, made his mind recoil at the bare &s;uppo&s;i|tion; and yet Laura, with all her happine&s;s, and all her titles, was but a wretch, if divided from that her fonde&s;t hope; but &s;he was now to en|gage in a new &s;cene.</P>
<P><PB N="177" REF="035640_0176_100694A6EDE33910">
Lord Oakendale and his niece, having grate|fully expre&s;&s;ed their thanks to Mrs. Greville and all her family, for their ho&s;pitality and kindne&s;s, took their leave of the grove, and &s;et out for London, where Lord Oakendale welcomed Laura as mi&s;tre&s;s of his hou&s;e, and &s;ole heire&s;s to the fortunes of Oakendale. She was vi&s;ited by a numerous train of company; &s;ome, who had heard her &s;tory, from real regard and friend&s;hip; others, from curio&s;ity, and a de&s;ire of finding &s;ome flaw in a character &s;o con&s;picuou&s;ly &s;uperior! But her fa&s;cinating manners gained her univer&s;al admiration. She &s;hone in the mo&s;t bril|liant circles, in which her eyes continually wand|ered in pur&s;uit of an object dearer to her than all the world.</P>
<P>It happened one evening, at an a&s;&s;embly, to which &s;he went unaccompanied by Lord Oaken|dale, that &s;he heard Lord Vincent announced. Her heart fluttered at the &s;ound, and, in a mo|ment after &s;he beheld her loved Eugene.</P>
<P>He did not immediately perceive her; but the moment his eyes encountered that fair form, which his heart had ever adored, he waited not for the ceremony of a formal introduction. He
<PB N="178" REF="035640_0177_100694AC4D9D32F0">
made his way to her; he &s;eized her hand, and for a few moments they forgot that the eyes of a whole a&s;&s;embly were rivetted upon them.</P>
<P>Laura was covered with blu&s;hes; and &s;ome of tho&s;e malignant &s;pirits (who, envious of her charms, and the &s;plendor in which &s;he &s;hone, were continually upon the watch to lower her merit) in&s;tantly took the hint, and a bur&s;t of ill|natured whi&s;pers a&s;&s;ailed her ear. A lady, who was her chaperon, relieved her embarra&s;&s;ment, by making room for Eugene to fit by her, with whom &s;he entered into chat, as if &s;he had been one of his mo&s;t intimate acquaintance, although &s;he had never &s;een him before.</P>
<P>This not only made Laura feel more ea&s;y, but al&s;o gave Eugene an opportunity of uttering a thou&s;and tender inquiries, in which his heart was truly intere&s;ted. The matter of his writing to her was cleared up to the entire &s;atisfaction of both parties, who had each lamented the &s;ilence of the other. The &s;ubject of the Abbey was but &s;lightly touched upon. It was evident they had both been confined there at the &s;ame time; and this idea afforded &s;en&s;ations too tender to be di&s;|cu&s;&s;ed in their pre&s;ent &s;ituation.</P>
<P><PB N="179" REF="035640_0178_100694AE89123078">
Eugene could not withdraw him&s;ef from the &s;ide of Laura, notwith&s;tanding &s;he repre&s;ented to him the impropriety of &s;o particular a conduct; and it had, indeed, given occa&s;ion for a thou&s;and ob&s;ervations replete with wittici&s;ms and &s;arca&s;m. "Two &s;uch &s;trange adventurers ought to come to|gether!&mdash;They had made out a mo&s;t delightful romantic &s;tory!&mdash;It was pity &s;o much invention &s;hould ever be divided!&mdash;How they mu&s;t triumph at having &s;o finely duped the two doating Lords!"</P>
<P>Such irony as this was the mo&s;t prevailing conver&s;ation of the different parties who formed the a&s;&s;embly; but &s;ome few there were who &s;aw them in a more candid and favorable light, who admired their virtues, and &s;eriou&s;ly wi&s;hed to &s;ee them happily united.</P>
<P>Laura returned home with her &s;pirits uncom|monly exhilerated. Lord Oakendale ob&s;erved it; and, as &s;he always gave him an account of whatever happened to her when he was not pre|&s;ent, &s;he would not now omit the circum&s;tance of meeting with Eugene; well knowing that, had &s;he not thought it right to have no concealments of this nature, he would have heard it from com|mon report; and &s;he likewi&s;e knew that no ac|quaintance
<PB N="180" REF="035640_0179_100694B33AA71360">
could be continued without Lord Oakendale's approbation.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as &s;he had related the account of their meeting, and had candidly expre&s;&s;ed her plea&s;ure at &s;eeing Eugene, Lord Oakendale bit his lip; his countenance betrayed evident di&s;plea&s;ure; and, after taking three or four turns acro&s;s the room, he &s;aid, "I hope, Laura, your heart has no &s;hare in the intere&s;ts of this Eugene; there are circum&s;tances in relation to that young man, which &s;hould make &s;uch a connection extremely obnoxious to me; be&s;ides, I have other views for you." Having &s;aid this, he wi&s;hed her good night with le&s;s tenderne&s;s than u&s;ual.</P>
<P>The moment he was gone Laura bur&s;t into tears. The oppo&s;ition Lord Oakendale had ex|pre&s;&s;ed gave her extreme unea&s;ine&s;s; and &s;he had &s;o much of the ob&s;tinacy inherent to human na|ture in her compo&s;ition, that this very oppo&s;ition only drew clo&s;er the links her inclinations had formed. Her fond imagination had never before &s;een Eugene in &s;o fair a light. What were ti|tles, honors, fortune, &s;he had almo&s;t &s;aid friends, in compari&s;on with her loved Eugene! To him &s;he would &s;acrifice all her hopes, and all her pro&s;|pects;
<PB N="181" REF="035640_0180_100694B5B8C0B3A8">
and with the&s;e re&s;olutions &s;he retired to re&s;t; but her mind was di&s;turbed; and when &s;he &s;aw her uncle in the morning, his di&s;concerted brow be&s;poke unea&s;ine&s;s; of which thinking her|&s;elf the cau&s;e, &s;he relaxed &s;omething of her re|&s;olves, and offered him the mo&s;t &s;oothing atten|tions.</P>
<P>It was not very likely to &s;uppo&s;e that Lord Oakendale could wi&s;h to &s;ee Eugene the hu&s;band of his niece. He had indeed, acted in concert with Lord Vincent at the di&s;covery of the my&s;tery at Oakendale Abbey; but &s;ince that time all in|tercour&s;e between them was broken off, and he never wi&s;hed to have it renewed by any cir|cum&s;tance, &s;till le&s;s by that of an union between Eugene and Laura, whom he loved with pa&s;&s;ion|ate fondne&s;s; and would have made her any &s;a|crifice, but that on which alone her happine&s;s de|pended.</P>
<P>Thus was their felicity interrupted. Eugene and Laura &s;ometimes met, and never without la|menting the cruelty of their de&s;tiny. She return|ed Lord Oakendale's kindne&s;s by the mo&s;t duti|ful attention; but &s;he could not bring her&s;elf to
<PB N="182" REF="035640_0181_100694B9790E04A0">
renounce her lover; neither would &s;he marry him without her uncle's con&s;ent. She hoped time would make an alteration in his &s;entiments, and from that hope &s;he drew comfort and re&s;ignation to her&s;elf; but could not &s;o ea&s;ily impre&s;s it upon her more impatient lover.</P>
<P>Lord Vincent loved Eugene too well to oppo&s;e his wi&s;hes; though, perhaps, he might, as well as Lord Oakendale, have formed connexions more plea&s;ing to him&s;elf; yet he acquie&s;ced in all his &s;on approved, of whom he was extremely proud, and had, by an act of parliament, em|powered him to take his name, and &s;ucceed to his e&s;tates; he was, therefore, in point of rank and fortune, a match for the daughter or niece of the proude&s;t Peer; yet the circum&s;tances of his birth were &s;uch as could not fail to be obnoxious to the Oakendale family, and could by no power be done away; though his father's intere&s;t at court was &s;uch, that, (as the immediate heir to his title was now dead) he had obtained a new patent, en|tailing his Peerage on his natural &s;on, Eugene.</P>
<P>Meantime Lord Oakendale found his health de|cline with rapidity; and he formed the fond wi&s;h of &s;eeing his beloved Laura &s;ettled in marriage
<PB N="183" REF="035640_0182_100694BDB7CA3230">
with &s;ome man worthy her va&s;t fortune, and &s;till greater merit. He con&s;idered her attachment to Eugene as a childi&s;h partiality, which would yield to better pro&s;pects and a lover of his choice. With the&s;e ideas he introduced the &s;on of his par|ticular friend, Sir Charles Burlington. He was a young man of good character and hand&s;ome per|&s;on; but he was five years younger than Laura, and was taken from the Univer&s;ity without hav|ing &s;een more of the world than a &s;chool-boy, in order to facilitate &s;o de&s;irable an union; for al|though Sir Charles had a very good unincumber|ed e&s;tate, which mu&s;t de&s;cend to this young man, yet a match with Laura Carleton was beyond their mo&s;t &s;anguine expectations.</P>
<P>When he was introduced to Laura, &s;he could &s;carcely prevent her countenance from &s;hewing marks of contempt and ridicule at the idea of his being her hu&s;band; for his appearance was more childi&s;h and youthful than was common at his age, and the embarra&s;&s;ment he felt on the occa|&s;ion added to his juvenile addre&s;s. She received him with politene&s;s, but with a determined re&s;o|lution never to con&s;ider him in any other light but that of an acquaintance.</P>
<P><PB N="184" REF="035640_0183_100694C2418B14A0">
Sir Charles Burlington was delighted with the pro&s;pect, and overwhelmed Mi&s;s Carleton with unmeaning compliments and over&s;trained civility. He might, indeed, be &s;aid to be courting for his &s;on, who &s;at &s;taring at Laura without once ven|turing to give an opinion or utter a &s;entence. Even Lord Oakendale him&s;elf was con&s;cious of the impropriety and di&s;proportion between them; but the fear of &s;eeing his niece united to Eugene would have reconciled him to yet greater di&s;pa|rity.</P>
<P>Laura avoided as much as po&s;&s;ible all particular conver&s;ation with her uncle. She &s;aw his health decline fait, and &s;he could not bear the idea of giving him unea&s;ine&s;s. She gave up all her time to attendance on him, and could &s;eldom be pre|vailed on to leave him. One night &s;he went to the Opera, where &s;he was met by Eugene, who placed him&s;elf by her; and in a few minutes young Burlington appeared in the pit, and, with|out any ceremony, thru&s;t him&s;elf between them.</P>
<P>Laura felt her&s;elf angry, and Eugene, having gained a place on the other &s;ide of her, a&s;ked, "if he &s;hould turn the boy out of the hou&s;e?" which Burlington having heard, re&s;ented with all
<PB N="185" REF="035640_0184_100694C49D996480">
the impetuous fury and violence of youth; and not content with abu&s;ing Eugene, in very gro&s;s terms, he called to &s;ome Oxonians, his friends, who were in the gallery, to come and give their a&s;&s;i&s;tance to a devili&s;h <HI>row</HI> that was going to begin.</P>
<P>Laura grew alarmed; the eyes of the audience were turned round towards them, and &s;everal gla&s;&s;es in the boxes were employed to bring a near|er view of the contending parties.</P>
<P>The lady, who came with Laura, had two daughters with her, who had never before been at an Opera; it would, therefore have been a cru|el mortification to have taken them away before it was nearly half over; neither was her carriage come for her.</P>
<P>But Laura could not bear to be the object of wonder, and, perhaps, ridicule; and &s;he earne&s;t|ly reque&s;ted Eugene to get her a chair, and &s;he would go home.</P>
<P>Eugene readily obeyed her command, and led her out of the pit, followed by Burlington, who expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf in the mo&s;t childi&s;h and unhand|&s;ome terms. The truth was, he had been drink|ing,
<PB N="186" REF="035640_0185_100694CA8743E4D0">
and flu&s;hed with liquor. The idea of being the o&s;ten&s;ible lover of Laura, gave him airs of boyi&s;h con&s;equence, that had di&s;turbed the plea|&s;ure of the evening, but could not be con&s;idered in a &s;erious light.</P>
<P>Eugene regarded it as no otherwi&s;e worth his notice, than as it had di&s;compo&s;ed Laura, and deprived him &s;ooner of her company. This he was telling her as he was going to put her into the chair, when young Burlington advanced, and &s;eized her hand, which &s;he drew from him with a look and expre&s;&s;ion of re&s;entment; when ju&s;t as he was about again rudely to take hold of her, one of the chairmen in&s;tantly perceived, and immediately knocked him down. Eugene, with|out paying any regard to the circum&s;tance, put her into the chair, and attended her to Lord Oak|endale's hou&s;e, in Portland-Place. He waited to &s;ee that &s;he was perfectly recovered, and heard the following di&s;cour&s;e from the chairman, who had knocked down young Burlington:</P>
<P>"Arrah, my dear young lady, I hope you will not be after being angry at my lending a blow to the lad who was after being impertinent; be|ca&s;e, my dear &s;houl, we be old acquaintance.

<P>Laura &s;tared at this harrangue of the chair|man, and after &s;ome recollection recognized, in the figure and features of this Hibernian, the very &s;ame man &s;he had beheld in &s;o frightful a &s;ituation in Oakendale Abbey; when, as he &s;aid, he had been hanged, and cut down before he was dead; and, having been thrown into this room, was re|&s;erved for di&s;&s;ection; when recovering, her open|ing the door relea&s;ed him! She was much &s;ur|pri&s;ed at the circum&s;tance, to which &s;he could not but give credit. She gave him &s;ome money, and de&s;ired he would come again the next day, when &s;he a&s;&s;ured him no harm &s;hould befall him; but &s;he knew that Lord Oakendale wi&s;hed to &s;ee and conver&s;e with every per&s;on that could give him any information of the tran&s;actions of the Abbey.</P>
<P><PB N="188" REF="035640_0187_100694D135F0EA08">
Patrick faithfully promi&s;ed to attend in the morning, by which time Laura prepared Lord Oakendale for &s;o extraordinary a vi&s;itor; whom when he arrived, gave the following account of him&s;elf, "That he was born at Carrick, in Ireland and at a proper age was bound appren|tice to a &s;hoemaker, with whom he nearly &s;erved his time; but getting acquainted with &s;everal bad people, he ran away from his ma&s;ter, and joined the White Boys, with whom he committed &s;everal outrages and violent depredations, for which he was frequently affraid of being brought to ju&s;tice, but good fortune always befriended him, and, after various e&s;capes, he came to Lon|don, where he engaged in ignoble employments, and at la&s;t &s;erved in the honorable &s;tation of lamp-lighter!</P>
<P>"That one evening when he was lighting the lamps at Lord Oakendale's door, a fe|male, from one of the balcony windows, acco&s;ted him and enquired his birth and education, and a&s;k|ed him, if he &s;hould not like to fill a more lucra|tive and honorable employment than that of lamp-lighter? He replied, "He was ready to undertake any bu&s;ine&s;s whereby he might rai&s;e
<PB N="189" REF="035640_0188_100694D39BE10A08">
his fortune, except that of committing murder, and that he could never bring him&s;elf to do;" up|on which &s;he a&s;&s;ured him, that it was not to com|mit murder that &s;he wi&s;hed him to change his profe&s;&s;ion; but only to follow, and bring her an exact account of a certain young gentleman, who&s;e abode &s;he pointed out, and for which &s;er|vice he &s;hould be very hand&s;omely rewarded.</P>
<P>Nothing could better &s;uit his inclinations and his genius, than &s;uch an idle profitable bu&s;ine&s;s. He accordingly &s;erved her in this capacity with &s;uch indefatigable zeal, that he gave her an exact account of all the young gentleman engaged in; and, about a fortnight after this, he was &s;ent down to Cumberland to give information to &s;ome particular per&s;ons that the above mentioned young gentleman would be in &s;uch a place, at &s;uch a time, where, he believed, he was after|wards taken and detained. That after he had undergone an examination, as to his fidelity and &s;ecrecy, he was employed to a&s;&s;i&s;t tho&s;e wretches, and pe&s;ts of &s;ociety, called re&s;urrection men, who brought numbers of bodies to Oakendale Abbey. They were generally received in the night; and the per&s;on, who was chief &s;uperintendant, and who paid the men who procured the bodies, was
<PB N="190" REF="035640_0189_100694D8EFC5B0C8">
named Marcel, and was brother to the woman of that name, who lived with lady Oakendale, and was the &s;ame that &s;poke to him when he was lighting the lamp.</P>
<P>Patrick continued to inform his lord&s;hip that he grew tired of the employment, and thought it a &s;hocking one; he therefore ran away, and joined a &s;et of coiners in the neighborhood of Penrith, where they were &s;oon after di&s;covered, taken, and brought to condign puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>At his trial he &s;aw his old ma&s;ter Marcel, at the &s;ight of whom (to u&s;e his own expre&s;&s;ion) his blood ran cold; for he &s;uppo&s;ed he was only come to watch for his condemnation, and like a crow after carrion, be&s;peak his body. This was really the ca&s;e; for Patrick &s;aid he remembered nothing after the fatal words of condemnation had pa&s;&s;ed upon him. His mind was all in a &s;tate of confu&s;ion; and, if any thoughts did occur, they were only on the wretched &s;tate to which his body would be &s;ubjected after he was dead; nor could the clergyman, who attended him, impre&s;s any ideas of that more immortal and im|material part of him, which could not &s;uffer by the hands of men.</P>
<P><PB N="191" REF="035640_0190_100694DA82803E58">
The fir&s;t idea of recollection he experienced. (after the noi&s;e of the crowd and the mob that attended him to the gallows had cea&s;ed) was of extreme pain in his head and neck, and a violent oppre&s;&s;ion upon his lungs. He &s;truggled for a few &s;econds, and gained re&s;piration; a mi&s;t be|fore his eyes &s;eemed to vani&s;h, and he recovered &s;ufficient &s;ight to perceive he was in a room with a dead body hung up on one &s;ide of it. It in|&s;tantly occurred to him that he was in the Abbey. He was horribly frightened, and he tried to ar|ticulate; but found his throat &s;o &s;welled that he could only utter a guggling kind of &s;ound; when in a moment the door of the room gently opened, and a beautiful creature entered, whom he &s;up|po&s;ed to be an inhabitant of that world into which he had been launched; yet, notwith&s;tanding the appearance of this fair object, his fir&s;t idea was that of making his e&s;cape which he in&s;tantly ef|fected by pa&s;&s;ing through the door &s;he had open|ed. Tran&s;ient as was the glance he had of her countenance, it neverthele&s;s made an impre&s;&s;ion never to be effaced, and the remembrance of this fair image coming to relea&s;e him from a place which contained all the horrors of death, created
<PB N="192" REF="035640_0191_100694DF38FD4390">
in him a penitence for his pa&s;t crimes, which would, he hoped in &s;ome degree, atone for the commi&s;&s;ion of them.</P>
<P>After this he ran as fa&s;t as his legs could carry him, till night overtook his &s;teps, and he laid down upon the gra&s;s till morning, when he a&s;ked for a cru&s;t of bread, and a draught of water, at a &s;mall cottage, from whence he begged his way up to London, where he has ever &s;ince been in hone&s;t employment, and has &s;incerely and truly repented of his pa&s;t crimes. When he &s;aw Laura handed out of the opera hou&s;e by Eugene, he in|&s;tantly remembered them both; and the &s;trong propen&s;ity he had to &s;peak to her got the better of all decorum.</P>
<P>Thus ended the narrative of Patrick O'Dennis, at which Lord Oakendale expre&s;&s;ed much &s;ur|pri&s;e. He hand&s;omely rewarded Patrick for his trouble, and &s;trongly recommended to him to per&s;evere in his good re&s;olutions.</P>
<P>Lord Oakendale made &s;ome comments upon Patrick's narrative, and &s;eeming to be in very good humor, Laura took occa&s;ion to mention the circum&s;tances of the preceding night, not omitting to enlarge upon the firm and polite con|duct
<PB N="193" REF="035640_0192_100694E0DE5D2D98">
of Eugene, in oppo&s;ition to that of the more boyi&s;h and in&s;olent behaviour of Mr. Burlington. Lord Oakendale could not but admit and approve of the former; and Laura gained &s;o far upon his good temper, as to obtain leave to di&s;mi&s;s that young fop from any love-like pretentions to|wards her. This was a great &s;tep gained, and Laura promi&s;ed, in her turn, to make &s;ome con|ce&s;&s;ions equally plea&s;ing to her uncle.</P>
<P>Comfort &s;eemed once more to dawn upon her, and &s;he had &s;ometimes (though not often) the happine&s;s of meeting Eugene. Lord Vincent fre|quently pre&s;&s;ed him to make another choice, &s;ince there was no probability of Lord Oakendale's giving his con&s;ent to an union with Laura, and to &s;ee Eugene &s;ettled in marriage, was the fir&s;t wi&s;h of his father. But although Eugene receiv|ed all the advances from the mi&s;&s;es, and all the overtures from their mothers and aunts, which are authorized and encouraged by the pre&s;ent race of females, yet was his heart faithful to its fir&s;t attachment; and, however he might de&s;pair of gaining Laura, he could never allow the idea of another woman as the &s;ole object of his affec|tions. Indeed, the&s;e firm re&s;olutions were be|come
<PB N="194" REF="035640_0193_100694E51703D498">
highly nece&s;&s;ary; for a young widow of the name of Sackville, laid <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">uch a well-regulated &s;iege to the heart of Eugene, and had &s;o many, and &s;uch fa&s;cinating charms, that it was almo&s;t im|po&s;&s;ible to re&s;i&s;t her power. She was be&s;ides high|ly favored, and &s;trongly recommended by Lord Vincent, for his future daughter; and this being the ca&s;e, Eugene was more frequently thrown in|to her company than he would otherwi&s;e have wi&s;hed; con&s;equently the world had pronounced them a pair de&s;tined for each other, with the ad|dition of the mo&s;t violent love &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between them.</P>
<P>The report could not fail to reach the ears of Laura. She did not at fir&s;t give the &s;malle&s;t cre|dit to it, but only con&s;idered it as the idle &s;tory of the day. It was, however, &s;o frequently, and &s;o &s;trongly repeated, that a &s;park of jealou&s;y be|gan to light up in her mind, and &s;everal little circum&s;tances kindled the flame to a tormenting &s;tate of unea&s;ine&s;s and &s;u&s;pen&s;e.</P>
<P>She &s;eldom &s;aw Eugene. He never came to Lord Oakendale's; and the ill &s;tate of his lord|&s;hip's health confined her very much at home. Whenever &s;he had met Eugene he was in compa|ny with Mrs. Sackville. Her heart could not
<PB N="195" REF="035640_0194_100694E8D2777290">
ea&s;ily give credit to his infidelity, yet a thou&s;and corroding fears rendered her mi&s;erable.</P>
<P>During this &s;tate of uncertainty Lord Oaken|dale grew every day more debilitated, and his health declined very fa&s;t. Laura was his &s;ole comfort, and to her he looked for every &s;atisfac|tion the world could give him. He had ob&s;erved her late unea&s;ine&s;s, and, perhaps, gue&s;&s;ed the cau&s;e, in which he could not but rejoice, however he might feel hurt at the effect. He redoubled his kindne&s;s to her; he told her &s;he would be &s;ole mi&s;tre&s;s of all his wealth at his decea&s;e, and often &s;ignified how ardently he wi&s;hed her to di|vide it with &s;ome worthy man.</P>
<P>What were wealth and honors to Laura! There was, indeed, an object dearer to her than all the world; and that object was now &s;aid to be devo|ted to another. How cruel was her fate! yet a more &s;evere one awaited her.</P>
<P>Her uncle grew every day wor&s;e; his di&s;order was &s;low but of &s;uch a nature as no remedy could reach. He found he mu&s;t &s;oon pay the debt of nature, and a lowne&s;s of &s;pirits &s;eized him. Something &s;eemed to pre&s;s upon his mind with a particular weight of unea&s;ine&s;s. Laura, ever at|tentive,
<PB N="196" REF="035640_0195_100694EEDD950750">
and willing to mitigate (as far as was in her power) the &s;orrow that &s;eemed to oppre&s;s him, u&s;ed every method &s;he could devi&s;e to re|move the melancholy he labored under, at the &s;ame time that her own mind was cruelly agi|tated.</P>
<P>Lord Oakendale &s;eemed &s;en&s;ible of her kind|ne&s;s. He would gaze at her for hours together, whil&s;t he uttered the mo&s;t bitter &s;ighs; and the pain of his mind &s;eemed to increa&s;e the malady of his body, and ha&s;tened his di&s;&s;olution. It was in one of the&s;e moments that Laura &s;aid, "Is there any thing I can do that will make my dear uncle more ea&s;y and compo&s;ed?"</P>
<P>"There is," replied Lord Oakendale; "but will my Laura make the &s;acrifice? I know it is a weakne&s;s in me to de&s;ire it; but it is a weakne&s;s I have tried in vain to conquer, and my peace de|pends upon her word."</P>
<P>"Speak," &s;aid Laura, in an agitated voice, though far from &s;u&s;pecting the nat<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters"> of the re|que&s;t, "and be a&s;&s;ured of all in my power."</P>
<P>"Can you, then," &s;aid Lord Oakendale, "will my Laura promi&s;e, &s;acredly promi&s;e, nev|er to marry Eugene Vincent?"</P>
<P><PB N="197" REF="035640_0196_100694F10A3CE538">
"Stop," &s;aid Laura; "Oh! &s;ave me from this conflict." Lord Oakendale &s;at with eagerne&s;s, and death depicted on his countenance. He &s;eemed impatiently waiting for a reply; yet trembling le&s;t he had made a reque&s;t which could not be granted; at the &s;ame time fearing that his weak frame could not &s;upport a refu&s;al.</P>
<P>"Alas!" &s;aid Laura (turning her head this way and that way, in the mo&s;t di&s;tracted &s;tate of terror and perplexity) have I no friend to advi&s;e me in this cruel conflict? Oh! my lord, Eugene is dearer to me than&mdash;" Here &s;he &s;topped, and a violent bur&s;t of tears, in &s;ome degree, re|lieved her.</P>
<P>During this time Lord Oakendale trembled, and appeared convul&s;ed. He gra&s;ped the hand of Laura, and faintly pronounced, "I am dying!" She was extremely terrified; and, as &s;he &s;upport|ed him with one arm, &s;he rang the bell with the other for a&s;&s;i&s;tance. He was conveyed to bed, and proper advice was immediately &s;ent for.</P>
<P>The &s;tate of Laura was very little better than that of her uncle. She had not as yet given the fatal promi&s;e that would &s;eal her mi&s;ery; but the dying &s;ituation of Lord Oakendale, and the
<PB N="198" REF="035640_0197_100694F71740E568">
wi&s;h he had &s;o devoutly expre&s;&s;ed, &s;eemed to re|quire it. She went to his chamber fully determin|ed to make the &s;acrifice of her happine&s;s, if it was nece&s;&s;ary to his peace of mind.</P>
<P>As &s;he proceeded to Lord Oakendale's room, &s;he reflected on the con&s;equences of what &s;he was about to do. What were riches, honors, titles, fame, or any worldly comfort, without the charm|ing liberty of be&s;towing them on the only object of her love! yet, might not the promi&s;e &s;he was about to make be of the utmo&s;t con&s;equence to her&s;elf, as &s;eemed &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to calm the depart|ing &s;pirit of Lord Oakendale; that promi&s;e, which to confirm, tore her heart a&s;&s;under. In what e&s;timation might it be held by the per&s;on for who&s;e &s;ake alone &s;he would withold it. Ah! (but there was madne&s;s in that thought) it might be a happy relea&s;e to Eugene, and at once enable him to cancel tho&s;e vows which had made hers &s;o binding. The&s;e reflections brought her to the chamber-door; and, upon her entering, the phy|&s;icians informed her Lord Oakendale had but a few minutes to live, and that he had never once &s;poke &s;ince &s;he left him!</P>
<P>She approached the bed; &s;he took his hand, and kneeling down, &s;he pre&s;&s;ed it to her lips,
<PB N="199" REF="035640_0198_10068F1B80A3ECD8">
while the tears fell in large drops from her eyes. He looked at her with the tendere&s;t pity. She thought him perfectly &s;en&s;ible; and &s;he was go|ing to pronounce her promi&s;e, when he fixed his hand (already clammy with the dew of death) up|on her lips, as if to prevent her &s;peaking. She rai&s;ed up her eyes in thankful expre&s;&s;ion to Hea|ven for the relea&s;e; and, although he mourned, perhaps, inwardly, his countenance conveyed content and approbation. For a few &s;econds he &s;eemed &s;truggling for &s;peech. He withdrew his hands from Laura's, and, joining them in a &s;upplicating form, he articulated "Ble&s;s my niece!" and expired.</P>
<P>Laura was extremely &s;hocked at the &s;udden, ap|proach of his death, and &s;he grieved for him with the mo&s;t affectionate &s;incerity. She was perfect|ly &s;atisfied that he wi&s;hed to recal the promi&s;e he had de&s;ired her to make, and was convinced that the hand of death had awakened him to contri|tion, and a proper &s;en&s;e of the cruelty his more lively feelings would have impo&s;ed.</P>
<P>Laura found her&s;elf in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all his va&s;t fortune; and &s;he had the comfort and advice of her dear Madame du Frene in the arrangement of the funeral, and other nece&s;&s;ary matters. She
<PB N="200" REF="035640_0199_100694FE6E35ECF0">
had likewi&s;e the &s;atisfaction of a&s;king that dear friend concerning Eugene, to whom Madame du Frene had always been extremely partial. Lord Oakendale had on that account not &s;hewn her &s;o much favor as he would otherwi&s;e have done; and during his illne&s;s Laura had been but little out to meet with her.</P>
<P>When &s;he a&s;ked concerning him, Madame du Frene looked grave, and only replied "he was well."</P>
<P>Laura did not feel contented with the an&s;wer; but a certain di&s;like to lead to the &s;ubject, unle&s;s more encouraged by her friend, prevented her adding more at pre&s;ent. She thought it unkind that Eugene never made any inquiries after her; and, as &s;he did not yet go into public, &s;he never chanced to &s;ee him. Soon, however, &s;he return|ed her vi&s;its, and appeared in public. Her &s;able dre&s;s dimini&s;hed nothing of her beauty, and the knowledge of her large and independent fortune gave additional charms to her per&s;on. She once or twice &s;aw Eugene, and was &s;hocked at the cold|ne&s;s of his addre&s;s and manners towards her. He always looked uncommonly grave, and avoided any further conver&s;ation than the common-place forms of ceremony required. Such behavior was
<PB N="201" REF="035640_0200_1006950210978F00">
to her unaccountable, and cruel in the extreme. He could, &s;he thought, but have behaved in this manner had &s;he really made that promi&s;e to Lord Oakendale, which &s;he had con&s;idered as &s;o fatal to her peace.</P>
<P>Harra&s;&s;ed and fretted as &s;he was from this con|duct, and finding neither riches or admiration af|forded her the &s;malle&s;t happine&s;s in this uncertain &s;tate, &s;he determined to come to a more particular explanation with Madame du Frene on the &s;ub|ject &s;o near her heart.</P>
<P>She accordingly took the opportunity of ex|pre&s;&s;ing her &s;urpri&s;e and wonder at the coldne&s;s of Eugene's behavior.</P>
<P>Madame du Frene remained &s;ilent for &s;ome mo|ments, and then &s;aid, "My dear Laura, how often, in your days of childhood, have I endea|vored to prepare your mind for tho&s;e di&s;appoint|ments which come neare&s;t the heart, and which, if borne with pious re&s;ignation, are the brighte&s;t ornaments to the chri&s;tian character. I am truly &s;orry to have occa&s;ion now to enforce this doc|trine; but Eugene is, I am informed, engaged to marry Mrs. Sackville." Here &s;he &s;topped, and Laura &s;at with her arms re&s;ted on a table, and her hands covered her face. She &s;ighed bitterly.
<PB N="202" REF="035640_0201_10069505EAE4E178">
and when &s;he looked up, Madame du Frene had the mortification to ob&s;erve marks of the mo&s;t extreme &s;orrow depicted in her countenance.</P>
<P>Nothing more pa&s;&s;ed at the pre&s;ent time. Ma|dame du Frene was &s;o much hurt at the appear|ance of woe which Laura's looks expre&s;&s;ed, that &s;he was re&s;olved to &s;peak to Eugene upon the &s;ubject, although &s;he had little or no hopes of ev|er &s;eeing them united.</P>
<P>It happened &s;oon after that Madame was, by her own contrivance, thrown into company with Eugene; when &s;he purpo&s;ely introduced the &s;ub|ject of Laura, ob&s;erving upon her immen&s;e for|tune, and &s;till greater merits; adding her earne&s;t hopes, that &s;he would be&s;tow it upon &s;ome man truly worthy of &s;o rich a ble&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>Eugene &s;ighed, and a&s;ked (in a melancholy tone) "If Laura was likely to be married?"</P>
<P>"Not that I know," replied Madame du Frene. "I &s;hould imagine &s;he would be extremely care|ful how &s;he formed a &s;econd attachment, having been &s;o cruelly di&s;appointed in her fir&s;t."</P>
<P>Eugene &s;eemed much agitated, and, after a pau&s;e, &s;aid, "If &s;he had &s;uffered any di&s;appoint|ment,
<PB N="203" REF="035640_0202_1006950913370D58">
it was of her own inflicting; and the cruel|ty was deeply and forever transfixed in the bo&s;om of another."</P>
<P>Madame Du Frene replied, "Good God!" what is it you mean? When nature formed the faire&s;t of its compo&s;itions, no material was omit|ted; and Laura is, I am certain of that di&s;po&s;i|tion, as would rather &s;uffer pain her&s;elf than in|flict it upon others."</P>
<P>"Why, then," &s;aid Eugene, "did &s;he make that ra&s;h&mdash;I will &s;ay that accur&s;ed promi&s;e?"</P>
<P>"What promi&s;e!" replied Madame Du Frene; "&s;he never did make any; Lord Oakendale was taken &s;peechle&s;s before &s;he had time to pronounce a promi&s;e, which nothing but the agonies of death would have extorted from her; and even in that moment &s;he wavered, and profe&s;&s;ed that terrible you was dearer to her than life! Nay," continued Madame du Frene, "&s;he had the &s;atisfaction of knowing, and being a&s;&s;ured, that her uncle appro|ved of her conduct, and ble&s;&s;ed her with his part|ing breath!"</P>
<P>Thus was this di&s;tre&s;&s;ing bu&s;ine&s;s brought to an amicable conclu&s;ion; and Madame Du Frene had the inexpre&s;&s;ible felicity of reconciling two lovers who&s;e hearts had never been divided.</P>
<P>It appeared that Lord Oakendale, extremely
<PB N="204" REF="035640_0203_1006950AC46BE988">
de&s;irous to break the bonds which &s;o clo&s;ely uni|ted Eugene and Laura, had mentioned to &s;ome particular friends that Laura had given him &s;o|lemn promi&s;e never to marry Eugene. In con|&s;equence of this report Lord Vincent's pride took the alarm, and he repeated it to Eugene with exaggerated proofs.</P>
<P>Thus had the&s;e two unhappy men nearly de|&s;troyed the felicity of tho&s;e mo&s;t dear to them by their ill-judging zeal, and &s;till more blamable &s;ub|ver&s;ion of the truth.</P>
<P>Eugene, with a mind di&s;tracted with di&s;ap|pointment, flew to di&s;&s;ipation to di&s;pel his mi&s;ery; and, falling in the way of a young and fa&s;cinating widow, he had nearly formed that contract with her, which his honor would have obliged him to fulfil, and nothing but death could have di&s;&s;olved.</P>
<P>The death of Lord Vincent, &s;oon after the&s;e occurrences, gave to his &s;on, title, wealth and power. His inclinations had long been fixed, and the merits of Laura were amply rewarded by an union with her loved Eugene. Some of their &s;ummers were pa&s;&s;ed in Cumberland; and the virtues of Lord Vincent and Laura &s;oon di&s;pelled THE HORRORS OF OAKENDALE ABBEY.</P>
