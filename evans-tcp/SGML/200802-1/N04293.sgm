<P><ADD>This &s;pace of Time may not improperly be di&s;tin|gui&s;h'd as the fir&s;t Period of the Paper Currency in New-England, both on Account of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">mall Sum</ADD> in Bills of <ADD>Credit, which were then &s;uffer'd by the</ADD> <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts</HI> Go|<ADD>vernment to be current at one and</ADD> the &s;ame Time, and of <ADD>the Shortne&s;s of the Periods</ADD> limited for drawing the Bills <ADD>back into the Trea&s;ury,</ADD> which were confin'd to the Year next &s;ucceeding their re&s;pective Emi&s;&s;ions at farthe&s;t.</P>
<P>During this Period I find that all the Bills, except the fir&s;t emitted Parcel, were receiv'd at the Trea&s;ury at 5 <HI>per Cent</HI> Advance, and pa&s;&s;ed Current at <HI>Par</HI> with <HI>Silver;</HI> and that an Act of the General Court was pa&s;s'd in 1699, for com|pelling the Con&s;tables and other Collectors to gather &amp; pay into the Trea&s;ury the &s;everal Rates committed to their Charge at the Time limited in the Trea&s;urer's Warrants, by enabling the Trea&s;urer to i&s;&s;ue out Executions again&s;t the E&s;tates and Bodies of the <HI>deficient</HI> Con&s;tables and Collectors.</P>

<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> That in the Year 1712, to &s;upport the Value of the Province Bills, which appeared to be in &s;ome Danger of depreciating by the growing Scarcity of the <HI>Silver Cur|rency,</HI> which was now reckon'd to be reduc'd to the Propor|tion of little more than a Third of what the <HI>Paper Currency</HI> amounted to, a Law was pa&s;s'd that no Debtor, who &s;hould tender Payment of any Debt contracted &s;ince <HI>October</HI> 1705, or to be contracted before the la&s;t Day of <HI>October</HI> 1715, (except in the Ca&s;e of Specialties and Contracts in Writing) in <HI>Province</HI>-Bills, &s;hould be liable to have an Execution levy'd or &s;erv'd upon his E&s;tate or Per&s;on; which Tender of Bills, tho' it would not di&s;charge the Debt, yet it did

<P>All the Bills of the <HI>l.</HI>48,000 Loan in 1711 were drawn in and burnt long &s;ince; but there is &s;till out&s;tanding of the <HI>l.</HI> 50,000 emitted in 1714, about <HI>l.</HI> 2000, with the like Arrear due for Intere&s;t; of the <HI>l.</HI> 100,000 Loan in 1716, about <HI>l.</HI> 7000, of the <HI>l.</HI> 50,000 Loan in 1720, <HI>l.</HI> 16, and of that of <HI>l.</HI> 60,000 in 1727, about <HI>l.</HI> 500; All which Sums are well &s;ecur'd, and may be expected to be drawn in with|in five or &s;ix Months.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="005302_0008_1016F91EEF34BB68">
I &s;hall further ob&s;erve upon the&s;e &s;everal Loans, That the fir&s;t of 'em in 1711 was at lea&s;t excu&s;able, if not a laudable In&s;tance of the Province's Zeal for his Maje&s;ty's Service; but that the four &s;ub&s;equent Loans, which had not the &s;ame Rea&s;on for their Emi&s;&s;ion, very much contributed by the largene&s;s of their Sums and long Periods to depreciate the Bills of Credit in general, and in Conjunction with the <HI>Rhode-I&s;land</HI> Loans, who&s;e Bills begun now to obtain a gene|ral Currency in this Province, even to le&s;&s;en the real Quan|tity of that Medium of Trade, which they were de&s;ign'd to increa&s;e; And that the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts</HI> Government has long been &s;o &s;en&s;ible of the Country's Error in making the&s;e Loans, that they would not, I am per&s;uaded, be in Danger of relap&s;ing into it, tho' they &s;hould be under no Re&s;traint from His Maje&s;ty's In&s;truction to his Governour.</P>
<P>In this Period al&s;o the&s;e further Particulars are ob&s;ervable,</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> That the Bills continu'd to be taken at the Trea|&s;ury at 5 <HI>per Cent</HI> Advance 'till 1718, ever &s;ince which Year that Allowance upon the Payment of the Bills has been taken off by the General Court under a Notion that it did not contribute towards &s;upporting the Value of the Bills.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> That the Silver and Gold Currency now de|creas'd more and more every Year, and about the Year 1726 quite vani&s;h'd, and coin'd Silver and Gold became from that Time mere Merchandize.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> That the Periods for drawing back the Bills emitted upon <HI>Funds of Taxes</HI> into the Trea&s;ury were more and more protracted, 'till by the Year 1721 they were lengthen'd out to the Di&s;tance of thirteen Years from their re&s;pective Emi&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> That the In&s;tances of the A&s;&s;embly's po&s;tpon|ing the Apportionment of the Taxes for drawing in the Bills according to their limited Periods were very rare, and
<PB N="10" REF="005302_0009_1016F921C6C29358">
the Bills were generally actually drawn into the Trea&s;ury till 1721, &s;ince which Year large Sums of the Bills emitted upon <HI>Funds of Taxes</HI> were &s;uffer'd by the Government to be out&s;tanding beyond their &s;tated Periods for want of Executions being i&s;&s;ued out again&s;t the deficient Collectors of the Taxes according to the Province Law be|fore-mention'd, &s;o that by the End of the Year 1730 <HI>l.</HI> 164,755 5<HI>&s;.</HI> 5<HI>d.</HI> was out&s;tanding by that Means.</P>

The Effect of this Act, as it was pa&s;s'd at fir&s;t, was that the Debtor was obliged to pay the Creditor, over and above the nominal Sum of his Debt, &s;o much as the Bills were depreciated from the Value, at which they were fir&s;t emitted; which upon the Experience of it proved inconvenient and oppre&s;&s;ive to the Debtor, by compelling him to pay the Cre|ditor in the fir&s;t and only In&s;tance of it's having been then carried into Execution &s;even and an half <HI>per Cent.</HI> more than was his ju&s;t Due; wherefore in <HI>May</HI> 1743 the <HI>A&s;&s;em|bly</HI> upon the <HI>Governour'</HI>s Me&s;&s;age to 'em recommending the following Amendment of it, <HI>viz.</HI> That the Creditor &s;hould be allow'd only &s;o much, as the Bills &s;hould be de|preciated below the Value, which they were of at the Time of contracting the Debt, amended it accordingly: And thereby the true Point of Ju&s;tice between the Debtor &amp; Creditor, which is that every Debtor &s;hould pay, and every Creditor receive the full Value of his Debt, and no more, was e&s;tab|li&s;h'd upon a firm Ba&s;is, all po&s;&s;ible Over-reaching or Op|pre&s;&s;ion of the Debtor avoided, and the perpetual Execution of the Act well &s;ecur'd, which it would have been very difficult to have pre&s;erv'd upon the Terms, in which the Act was fram'd at fir&s;t.</P>
<P>And this is all that the <HI>Governour</HI> could po&s;&s;ibly do for preventing the mi&s;chievous Effects of the Bills; and it is evident that this Provi&s;ion in the Act would effectually &s;e|cure to every Per&s;on the Value of that Part of his E&s;tate, which is out&s;tanding in Debts, and be an adequate Remedy for the Chief Mi&s;chiefs, that aro&s;e before from the depre|ciating of the Bills, and check that litigious Spirit, which was grown to a con&s;iderable Head for want of &s;uch an Act, if Creditors &s;hall think fit to take the Benefit of it: In the Country they generally have; but in <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> the Shop|keepers, who have long ta&s;ted the Sweets of the deprecia|ting of the Bills, are aver&s;e to complying with it volunta|rily, and the Merchants their Creditors are tender of forcing 'em into it, by demanding an Allowance for the deprecia|ting of the Bills in a Court of Law; and &s;o it has had little or no Effect there; But all that <HI>Government</HI> can do, is to

<P>Upon this Ca&s;e I would ob&s;erve, <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> That &s;ome of tho&s;e Creditors, who cho&s;e to take the before-mention'd Security for their Debts, had a View of an exorbitant Gain in it ari&s;ing from the general Per&s;ua&s;ion, which prevail'd for a long Time, that by the Year 1741 all the <HI>old</HI> Bills would be drawn in; and that the re&s;t of the Creditors had at lea&s;t an Opinion that the Bills could not well fall lower, but were more likely to ri&s;e than fall in their Value; and it &s;eems not to be doubted, but that if the Bills had during this Cour&s;e of Time &s;ometimes ri&s;en as well as fall'n in their Value, and Creditors and Debtors had promi&s;cuou&s;ly been &s;ometimes Gainers &s;ometimes Lo&s;ers by the before-mention'd Contracts, every Per&s;on would have thought it ju&s;t that the

<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> That this Departure of the Courts of Judicature from their &s;ettled Practice was going contrary to the <HI>known Intent</HI> of the Parties at the Time of contracting the Debt, which is not only the principal Rule of Equity, as it is &s;et|tled in the Engli&s;h Courts of Judicature, but likewi&s;e the general Rule of <HI>Ju&s;tice</HI> univer&s;ally e&s;tabli&s;h'd in all Com|munities, and governing them&s;elves by the accidental <HI>Event</HI> of the Contracts, which was novel and un&s;afe to be intro|duced into the Provincial Courts in <HI>any</HI> In&s;tance.</P>

<P>And Per&s;ons who had purchas'd Lands &s;ubject to old Mortgages before this late Alteration of the Practice of the Provincial Courts, and had only an Allowance made in the Purcha&s;e Money for tho&s;e Incumbrances according to the depreciated Value of the Bills, would be compell'd by the Mortgagees to pay for the Redemption of tho&s;e Lands more than what they were allow'd in the Purcha&s;e of 'em for the Incumbrances by the Mortgageors.</P>
<P>And for the&s;e and other Mi&s;chiefs too long to be enume|rated here, and which would befall other Per&s;ons in the Community be&s;ides Debtors, if this new Rule of Practice in the Courts of Judicature was to take Place in all Ca&s;es, it was impo&s;&s;ible for the Legi&s;lature to provide an adequate Remedy.</P>

<HI>Fourthly,</HI> That as many of the old Debts would be doubled, &s;ome trebled, and &s;ome few augmented almo&s;t fourfold by this new Rule of the Courts of Judicature, it &s;eem'd unavoidable that &s;ome of the poorer Sort of Fami|lies in the Province would be wholly broke up and ruin'd by it; which Con&s;equences &s;o alarm'd the <HI>Hou&s;e of Repre|&s;entatives,</HI> that upon the Petitions of two of the Debtors they pa&s;s'd a Vote for nullifying the&s;e Judgments of Court; but they mi&s;carry'd in <HI>Council;</HI> And at the Clo&s;e of the Se&s;&s;ion in <HI>April</HI> 1733 a Bill was unanimou&s;ly pa&s;s'd by the <HI>Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives,</HI> and concurr'd by the <HI>Council,</HI> and lay'd before the <HI>Gonernour</HI> for his Con&s;ent, the Purport of which was to declare by Way of Explanation of the &s;everal Acts for preventing the Oppre&s;&s;ion of Debtors, that the before-mention'd Bonds and Mortgages were not <HI>Specialties</HI> within the Exception of tho&s;e Acts, according to the true Intent and Meaning of 'em <HI>at the Time of their being pa&s;s'd:</HI> But I find by the Governour's Speeches upon this Occa&s;ion, that tho' he was of Opinion that in the Beginning the Credi|tor had the Rule of Law on their Side, yet he thought the Law had been &s;o long <HI>otherwi&s;e</HI> under&s;tood, and practis'd upon by the Courts of Judicature, that the <HI>general Error</HI> in that Ca&s;e had obtain'd the Force of Law, according to the receiv'd Maxim in the Courts of Law, <HI>Communis Error facit Jus:</HI> And as he was of Opinion that the Courts of Judicature's departing from their e&s;tabli&s;h'd Rule of Con|&s;truction in this Ca&s;e, and breaking thro' the <HI>real Intent</HI> of the Parties would be of mi&s;chievous Con&s;equence to the Community, he join'd with the <HI>A&s;&s;embly</HI> in recommend|ing it to the Judges of the Superior Court of Judicature to re-con&s;ider at their next Court the Judgments, which they had made up on old Bonds or Mortgages of the before|mention'd Tenor (which were only two in Number) and in their future chancering of <HI>old</HI> Bonds and Mortgages of that Tenor to ob&s;erve the <HI>Intent</HI> of the Parties according to their former Rule of Con&s;truction; and in the mean Time Execution was &s;tay'd in tho&s;e two Ca&s;es, one of which was of the Value of about <HI>l.</HI> 100, and the other of about <HI>l.</HI>3 10<HI>&s;.

<P>I &s;hall illu&s;trate this Ob&s;ervation with one Fact more: I find that in the Year 1712 there was current in the Pro|vince 179038<HI>l.</HI> 15<HI>&s;.</HI> 9<HI>d.</HI> in Bills of the <HI>old</HI> Tenor, which then were equivalent to 716153<HI>l.</HI> 3<HI>&s;.</HI> 0<HI>d.</HI> in Bills of the &s;ame Tenor and Denomination, according to their pre&s;ent depreciated Value, which Sum exceeds the Quantity of all the Bills of Credit now current in the Province; and yet the Bills of Credit continu'd at <HI>Par</HI> with Silver till the Year 1713, and were not in the lea&s;t depreciated by their im|moderate Quantity, tho' <HI>l.</HI>88,000 of it, which was then equal to <HI>l.</HI>352,000 was emitted within the Year 1711, and the Bulk of the Remainder was all i&s;&s;ued in the Compa&s;s of a few Years before; which &s;eems to be a full Demon&s;tra|tion that the depreciating of the Bills from 40 to 495 <HI>per Cent.</HI> Advance, (the middle Price of Exchange at this Day) is not <HI>primarily</HI> owing to the immoderate Quantity of the Emi&s;&s;ions of the Paper Currency in the &s;ub&s;equent Years; tho' I doubt not but it has frequently contributed towards it at &s;uch particular Conjunctures, as I have before mention'd.&mdash;The true Account of the Matter is this; The Trade of the Province had till this Time been in very flouri&s;hing Circum&s;tances; the <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay</HI> formerly &s;upply'd not only the re&s;t of <HI>New-England,</HI> but the Colonies of <HI>New-York,</HI> the <HI>Jer&s;eys, Penn&s;ylvania,</HI> and other Parts of the Continent, even as far as <HI>South-Carolina,</HI> with the chief Part of their <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and other <HI>European</HI> Goods, and carry'd on a very large Cod-Fi&s;hery at <HI>Can&s;o,</HI> and a con&s;iderable Whale-Fi&s;hery in it's own Bay, &s;upply'd the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> We&s;t-Indies wholly with Lumber and live Stock, and <HI>Jamaica</HI> and <HI>Barbadoes</HI> with great Part of their Wines from <HI>Ma|deira</HI> and the <HI>Cape de Verd</HI> I&s;lands, drove a large Trade to the <HI>Bay of Honduras, Surinam, Newfoundland, Holland,</HI> the <HI>Streights</HI> and the <HI>Mediterranean;</HI> by all which it was fur|ni&s;h'd

when their di&s;tant Periods &s;hall arrive; but can we rea|&s;onably depend upon their compelling their own Inhabi|tants to redeem the Bills out&s;tanding in this Province with their <HI>Hou&s;es,</HI> or <HI>Lands,</HI> or any other Part of their <HI>E&s;tates?</HI> May they not rather a&s;&s;i&s;t 'em with further Emi&s;&s;ions of Bills to enable 'em to pay off their old Debts to the <HI>Rhode-I&s;land</HI> Government: And will not the Con&s;equence of that be to augment the Quantity of their Colony Bills, which the Inhabitants of this Province have already current among 'em, in &s;o exce&s;&s;ive a Degree as that the Province mu&s;t at la&s;t &s;ink under the Lo&s;s ari&s;ing to it by 'em: The Circulation of the Bills among our &s;elves may po&s;&s;iby hide the pernicious Effects of 'em to the Province for &s;ome Time; But can it be rea&s;onably thought that a Cir|culation of Bills without any Pro&s;pect of their Redemption by the Government that emitted 'em, and with very little other Value to this Province at the bottom, than what they receive by the Circulation it &s;elf in the Province, &s;hould not fail in a few Years; and what a Scene of Di&s;tre&s;s and Ruin that would produce in the Province I need not tell you.</P>
<P>The&s;e, <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> are Matters, that demand your clo&s;e&s;t Attention, and the mo&s;t &s;peedy Redre&s;s: What will it avail the Province for this Government to take due Care of the Regulation of it's own Bills, if it mu&s;t &s;till be expo&s;ed to be ruin'd by the immoderate Quan|tities of the Bills of it's Neighbours, emitted for no other vi&s;ible Purpo&s;e, than to be &s;unk in this Province; whereby they have it in their Power to become Ma&s;ters of whatever Share of our Sub&s;tance and our Trade they &s;hall be pleas'd to take in exchange for their Bills.</P>
<P>As to the proper Method for procuring the Redemp|tion of the Bills of the&s;e two Government already in|troduced among us, or preventing the Introduction of more of 'em into the Province, I &s;hould be glad if I could &s;ugge&s;t to you any Thing, which it may be in the Power of this Government to do further than what they

have already done: In 1738 an Act with a con&s;ider|able Penalty in it was pa&s;s'd for preventing the Bills of any of the neighbouring Governments, which had been emitted &s;ince the fir&s;t Day of <HI>May</HI> in the &s;ame Year, or &s;hould afterwards be emitted, from being utter'd in this Province, unle&s;s they were made redeemable by lawful Money upon good Security within ten Years after their fir&s;t Emi&s;&s;ion, and it &s;hould &s;o appear by the Tenor and upon the Face of the Bills: But this you are &s;en&s;i|ble, <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> had not any Effect to check the Currency of 'em among us before <HI>September</HI> la&s;t, when a Procla|mation was i&s;&s;ued with the Advice and Con&s;ent of his Maje&s;ty's Council to inforce the Ob&s;ervation of it upon all His Maje&s;ty's Subjects within this Province in general, and the civil Officers within it in particular: This I hope may have had it's proper Effect upon the Officers, but doubt much whether it has had any upon others: And in <HI>June</HI> la&s;t a Committee was appointed by the General Court on Behalf of this Province to treat with &s;uch other Gentlemen, as might be appointed by the three neighbouring Governments on their Parts, in order to project &s;ome Mea&s;ures for preventing the fur|ther depreciating of the Bills of Credit of the re&s;pective Governments, or otherwi&s;e to con&s;ider of &s;ome Method for bringing 'em to a Period in &s;uch Manner, as &s;hould be ju&s;t and equal, and mo&s;t for the Intere&s;t of the Inha|bitants of the&s;e Governments: And I am informed by Mr. Secretary that he &s;ent Letters of Advice concerning this Matter to the &s;everal neighbouring Governments, de&s;iring their Concurrence in the&s;e Mea&s;ures, but with|out having receiv'd any An&s;wer from 'em.&mdash;If any Thing can be &s;till further done for remedying the&s;e Mi&s;chiefs by this Government, I &s;hall readily concur with you in it.</P>
<P><HI>Gentlemen,</HI></P>
<P>Whatever &s;ome Per&s;ons may per&s;wade them&s;elves, it is certainly an Error to think that any of His Maje&s;ty's Colonies have the Privilege conferr'd upon 'em by

<HI>Charter</HI> to make Money; Coinage is an undoubted Part of the Royal Prerogative, and the Practice of &s;triking Bills of publick Credit to pa&s;s in Lieu of Money &s;tands &s;olely upon the Royal Indulgence, and is warrantable no further than it is nece&s;&s;ary for the Support of His Ma|je&s;ty's Government within the Colony or Province, that u&s;es it: The Bills of this Government, which have been i&s;&s;ued within the&s;e la&s;t ten Years, &s;tand indeed up|on a different Foundation from that of the Bills of the two beforemention'd Colonies: They have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">mit|ted by formal Acts of the Legi&s;lature, which have re|ceiv'd the Sanction of His Maje&s;ty's Royal Approba|tion: And they are no le&s;s di&s;tingui&s;h'd from tho&s;e of the two Colonies by their Quality, having been emitted only to defray the nece&s;&s;ary Expences of Government, and being &s;ecured to be drawn back into the Trea&s;ury generally at &s;uch rea&s;onable Periods, as the Circum&s;tan|ces of the People would bear, by &s;ufficient Funds of Taxes, which is the proper Government Method for rai&s;ing publick Money: The whole Arrear of Bills lately out&s;tanding beyond their &s;tated Periods are now drawing in by Executions i&s;&s;ued in general again&s;t all the deficient Con&s;tables and other Collectors of Taxes throughout the Province, and will be very &s;peedily &s;unk: And the &s;inking of the Bills of the new Tenor, who&s;e Periods are not yet arriv'd, at the Time limited by their Emi&s;&s;ion Acts, are by a late Provi&s;ion made in the Acts them&s;elves &s;ecured from all Danger of being po&s;tponed: The Government has now &s;ecured to Creditors the full Value of their out&s;tanding Debts again&s;t the <HI>future</HI> de|preciating of it's Bills, and has lately paid the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors a very large Sum in Satisfaction for the <HI>past</HI> depreciating of 'em.</P>
