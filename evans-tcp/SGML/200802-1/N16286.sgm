<HEAD>LETTER I.</HEAD>
<P>IN every part of the&s;e &s;tates the great <HI>&s;carcity of money</HI> is become a common &s;ubject of complaint. This does not &s;eem to be an imaginary grievance, like that of <HI>hard times,</HI> of which men have complained in all ages of the world; the misfortune is gene|ral, and in many ca&s;es it is &s;everely felt. The &s;carcity of money is &s;o great, or the difficulty of paying debts has been &s;o common, that riots and combinations have been formed in many places, and the operations of civil government have been &s;u&s;pended: this is the more remarkable, becau&s;e three years have not pa&s;&s;ed &s;ince money was very plenty. A calamity of &s;uch magnitude has de&s;ervedly drawn the attention of every legi&s;lature in the union. In &s;ome of the &s;tates paper money has been coined as the be&s;t or the mo&s;t con|venient remedy by which the &s;ufferings of the people can be relieved. The general a&s;&s;embly of the &s;tate of North-Carolina has already had recour&s;e to two emi&s;&s;ions of paper. Certainly when any article is &s;carce, the general remedy is, <HI>to make more;</HI> and if it &s;hall be found, when money is &s;carce, that private and public debts can be hone&s;tly di&s;charged by a new coinage of paper, the expedient is admirable, for it is the mo&s;t ea&s;y proce&s;s by which debts were ever paid. This however, is a &s;ubject on which many doubts have ari&s;en. It is not que&s;tioned whether there are means by which we may be enabled to di&s;charge our debts and become opulent and pow|erful, but there are many who believe that our debts cannot be fairly di&s;charged, nor our citizens relieved, much le&s;s can they be|come rich by the manufacture of paper money. It has al&s;o been my lot to entertain &s;ome doubts, whether the regulations have hitherto been adopted for pre&s;erving ju&s;tice, for relieving the op|pre&s;&s;ed, and for &s;ecuring the pro&s;perity of the &s;tate;&mdash;the&s;e doubts have given ri&s;e to the pre&s;ent addre&s;s.</P>

This is a que&s;tion, my fellow citizens, that claims your utmo&s;t attention<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> for no &s;ubject of equal importance has been pre&s;ented to your view &s;ince the declaration of independence. We are go|ing to con&s;ider whether the admini&s;tration of government, in the&s;e infant &s;tates, is to be a &s;y&s;tem of patch-work, and a &s;eries of ex|pedients&mdash;Whether a youthful empire is to be &s;upported, like the walls of a tottering ancient palace by &s;hores and temporary props, or by mea&s;ures which may prove effectual and la&s;ting&mdash;mea&s;ures which may improve by u&s;e, and &s;trengthen by age. We are go|ing to con&s;ider whether we &s;hall de&s;erve to be the mo&s;t poor, di&s;ho|ne&s;t and contemptible, or the mo&s;t flouri&s;hing, independent and happy nation on the face of the earth.</P>
<P>The reader is not intere&s;ted in knowing who the writer of this letter may be; a bad argument is not mended by the &s;uppo&s;ed abilities of its author, and a good argument does not require paren|tal &s;upport. In the mean while he counts it his duty to declare, and he does it with humble gratitude, that his complaints are not occa&s;ioned by per&s;onal misfortunes; but he finds him&s;elf a mem|ber of a great family; he intere&s;ts him&s;elf as a brother in the hap|pine&s;s of his fellow citizens, and he &s;uffers when they are grieved.</P>
<P>The more I con&s;ider the progre&s;s of credit, and the increa&s;e of wealth in foreign nations, the more fully am I convinced that pa|per money mu&s;t prove hurtful to this country; that we cannot be relieved from our debts except by promoting dome&s;tic manufac|tures, and that during the prevailing &s;carcity of money, the bur|dens of the poor may be relieved by altering the mode of taxation. Here are three &s;eparate and di&s;tinct propo&s;itions; they &s;hall be con&s;idered apart, in order that each of them may fall or &s;tand by its own weakne&s;s or &s;trength.</P>
<P>In public mea&s;ures as in the conduct of private life, it will con|&s;tantly be found that <HI>"hone&s;ty is the be&s;t policy;"</HI> this maxim is &s;omewhat old, but it is not become u&s;ele&s;s. A paper currency, which is a legal tender, even when it may have depreciated 20 or 30 per cent. is not generally con&s;idered as an hone&s;t tender, and there are many rea&s;ons for believing that &s;uch a currency will not finally prove u&s;eful to the &s;tates. I &s;ay it has not generally been con&s;idered an <HI>hone&s;t</HI> tender. There are many people who &s;ay the money ought not to have depreciated; they &s;ay that nece&s;&s;ity ju&s;|tified the manufacture, and that we are bound to receive &s;uch pay|ment as the law pre&s;cribes: but I never have heard any man &s;ay that it would be perfect ju&s;tice to pa&s;s a law, by which every cre|ditor &s;hould be compelled to receive three fourths or two thirds of his debt in&s;tead of the whole debt; and yet &s;uch a law would be perfectly &s;imilar to the tender of depreciated paper, except that it would be a proof of more frugality and plain dealing; for it would
<PB N="3" REF="020887_0004_0FB1492423FF9B50">
he calling things by the right name, and would &s;ave the expence of paper coinage.</P>
<P>However convenient depreciated paper may appear to tho&s;e who u&s;e it in the di&s;charge of debts, we have already di&s;covered that the credit and finances of This <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ate <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> are injured by paper curren|cy, and we &s;hall certainly continue to &s;uffer, unle&s;s we can be re|lieved from it. There has ever been found much difficulty in &s;hak|ing off the prejudices of education. We have been accu&s;tomed to the u&s;e of paper money while we continued a depending province; &s;uch a currency was properly calculated to prevent the growth of manufactures, and to continue our dependence and poverty. Surely under a change of circum&s;tances there &s;hould be a change of mea|&s;ures; we ought now to con&s;ult our own pro&s;perity, and not the emolument of Great Britain, or any other kingdom. If we are willing to take a le&s;&s;on from other governments, we &s;hall find that money is not to be made out of paper, for there is not an empire, kingdom or &s;tate under the &s;un where debts may be legally di&s;|charged by paper money, except in &s;ome of the united &s;tates of America. It is admitted that a paper medium, under the form of bank notes or government &s;ecurities, is circulated in France, Eng|land, Holland, and mo&s;t other commercial countries; but nobody is compelled by law to receive the payment of any debt in &s;uch mo|ney; hence it is, that the paper of tho&s;e countries bears no re&s;em|blance to our's, except in name. Every man receives a bank note or refu&s;es it at plea&s;ure; when he receives it, he knows that on the next hour he may have it changed for gold or &s;ilver, as the bank is obliged to make &s;uch payments on demand. For this rea|&s;on bank notes, being portable, are frequently preferred to coin of the weighty metals. But it never was found that bank notes could be circulated at par, unle&s;s when it was believed that they might be exchanged for &s;olid money; nor could they be circulated, if they were declared to be a legal tender. The rea&s;on is obvi|ous&mdash;the whole value of paper is imaginary, and men do not be|lieve by compul&s;ion. Every attempt to force a man to believe that paper is equal in value to &s;ilver, implies a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s that it is not equal. It injures what it was intended to &s;ave. Though the paper money which had been emitted in North Carolina in the year 1783, had depreciated 20 per cent. arguments were invented on the la&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> year for making more money. It was alledged that under the regal government a greater &s;um of money had been circulated without much depreciation, and con&s;equently a &s;econd coinage might take place; it would not depreciate. This argument was plau&s;ible, but not &s;olid; for the value of paper is never found to depend on the quantity in circulation, but on the &s;ecurity that appears for its re|demption. The bank of England, which belongs to a company
<PB N="4" REF="020887_0005_0FB14925A47BA150">
of private &s;ubjects, circulates notes to the amount of thirty two millions of dollars, though it is not believed that they have above fourteen millions in &s;pecie at any time on hands; but every man can get money for his note when he demands it. In the year 1716, &s;oon after the death of Lewis the XIVth, the celebrated John Law, in company with &s;ome other gentlemen, obtained a patent for a banking hou&s;e at Paris. They i&s;&s;ued notes in which they promi&s;ed <HI>to pay the bearer, on &s;ight,</HI> a certain &s;um, <HI>in gold and &s;ilver of the weight and finene&s;s</HI> then <HI>e&s;tabli&s;hed by law.</HI> As the late King had altered the weight or quality of the current coin ten times during his reign, and the &s;ame thing might be done again, Law's notes, which were not &s;ubject to depreciation, were preferred to &s;pecie at one per cent. Such were the effects of a general con|fidence in good payment. Within the &s;pace of four years, notes were i&s;&s;ued by Law and company to the amount of 225 millions of dollars, which was near twice as much as all the &s;pecie in France; but the notes retained their credit, becau&s;e the company were thought to be hone&s;t and able to pay. On the twenty fir&s;t of May, 1721, the Duke of Orleans, regent of France, i&s;&s;ued a pro|clamation, by which he reduced the value of bank notes to half the nominal &s;um. They were depreciated fifty per cent. This was a proof of the want of integrity, and it operated accordingly; it de&s;troyed public confidence. It did not merely dimini&s;h the value of the notes,&mdash;it annihilated them, and on the 22d of May one guinea in gold could not have been purcha&s;ed in Paris for one thou&s;and guineas in notes. The hi&s;tory of paper money in all ages is uniform. It's value depends on the confidence of the public. Let government give a &s;ingle proof that they ought not to be tru&s;ted&mdash;Confidence vani&s;hes, and "like the ba&s;ele&s;s fabric of a vi&s;ion, leaves not a trace behind." Let us compare this with the hi&s;tory of the paper in &s;ome of our &s;tates, and con&s;ider whether it ought to have retained its value. The fir&s;t emi&s;&s;ion of the &s;tate of North-Carolina in 1783, was to have been redeemed by the &s;ale of forfeited e&s;tates. That foundation was &s;oon removed, and tho&s;e e&s;tates were con|verted to another u&s;e. The money depreciated, and recour&s;e was had to another coinage. This &s;econd &s;tructure was rai&s;ed, if po&s;|&s;ible, on a wor&s;e foundation, for it had not even the <HI>appearance</HI> of &s;tability; taxes are laid for calling in the money, and it is imme|diately re&s;tored to circulation. Was it expected that &s;uch money &s;hould pa&s;s as gold or &s;ilver? No, certainly. The legi&s;lature them|&s;elves do not &s;eem to have expected that it &s;hould be con&s;idered of equal value. Tobacco, a &s;taple of North-Carolina, has been purcha&s;ed by the public for two prices in this new money, and cre|ditors at the &s;ame time are compelled to receive it as &s;pecie, in the payment of debts. Is this <HI>ju&s;tice?</HI> Strangers will call it by a different name.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER II.</HEAD>
<P>IT is painful in all ca&s;es to animadvert on public mea&s;ures, lest we &s;hould hurt the feelings of any citizen with whom &s;uch mea&s;ures have originated. But truth is the friend of every man, and the author of every public mea&s;ure, if he be a good man, treats it as other men do: he &s;upports it while he be|lieves it to be good<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> he for&s;akes it whenever he finds it to be hurtful. For this rea&s;on I &s;hall proceed freely in con&s;idering the effects of paper money. I have &s;aid that paper money, which is a legal tender, mu&s;t prove hurtful to this country; when made, it mu&s;t depreciate, and the effects of depreciation are un|friendly to indu&s;try, injurious to the poor, and de&s;tructive of good morals. On the &s;uppo&s;ition that the paper currency in &s;ome of the &s;tates has depreciated one third, it will follow that the differ|ent citizens to whom this money was fir&s;t paid, in its depreciated &s;tate, mu&s;t have lo&s;t 33&frac13; per cent. on every payment; but as eve|ry bill of paper may have pa&s;&s;ed frequently from hand to hand, it will follow, that the &s;everal citizens of that &s;tate may have &s;uffered the lo&s;s of ten times that &s;um by receiving bad money in&s;tead of &s;olid coin to which they were entitled. This mu&s;t have been a very con&s;iderable tax, and unfortunately it was a tax of the mo&s;t per|nicious kind, for it was a tax on the frugal and temperate in favour of the idle, the profligate and luxurious. It cannot be right in government to protect and encourage vice; it is a plant that thrives &s;ufficiently in every &s;oil, without the help of legi&s;lative authority. In &s;upport of a mea&s;ure that agrees &s;o little with the common ideas of ju&s;tice, we have been told, that money was wanted for the &s;ake of the poor, that they might have a medium wherewith to pay their debts and taxes. Whoever has reflected
<PB N="6" REF="020887_0007_0FB14928A05DACD0">
on the circulation of paper money, will be apt to &s;ay, that the ho|ne&s;t poor man has not been the chief gainer by it. There is &s;ome difficulty in di&s;covering how the poor man &s;hould be profited by a coinage of money. If he had been po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of marketable pro|perty, before the money was made, he might have &s;old it for the full value; for there has been no &s;ea&s;on in which produce has not been &s;old for more than its worth; the exporters have been lo&s;ers; if the poor man had no property for &s;ale, neither could he have got any of the new money, unle&s;s it was to have been given away. There is doubtle&s;s &s;ome ob&s;curity in this bu&s;ine&s;s, unle&s;s we alledge, that depreciation was intended, and this we are not willing to &s;u&s;|pect. Let us &s;uppo&s;e that the poor man may have gained a trifle by the depreciation of money; what is &s;uch a gain when compared with his &s;ufferings by the lo&s;s of credit? No man can expect to bor|row money nor obtain goods on credit, when government does not &s;upport the creditor again&s;t di&s;hone&s;t payments by ba&s;e money. When the rich are taught by government not to give credit, the &s;uf|ferings of the poor mu&s;t be increa&s;ed, and when credit is de&s;troyed, indu&s;try mu&s;t langui&s;h; for they are con&s;tantly found to flouri&s;h in proportion to the hone&s;ty of government and the &s;tability of the legal money. So lately as on the 43d year of Queen Elizabeth, the coin of England was deba&s;ed almo&s;t nine per cent. by parlia|ment, and about that time the coin of France was frequently al|tered. The commerce of tho&s;e nations &s;uffered greatly by &s;uch in&s;tability. They have &s;ince profited by their good faith. There is no country in which the value of money has been &s;o perfectly &s;table as in Holland for the la&s;t 200 years; and it is admitted that no country has pro&s;pered &s;o much by commerce, nor any in which the intere&s;t of money is &s;o moderate. Security of property has ever proved the &s;pur to indu&s;try; hence we find that arts and commerce have flouri&s;hed mo&s;t in republican governments; for in ab&s;olute monarchies the value of money is not &s;table, and in de&s;potic governments the ca&s;e is wor&s;e&punc; in &s;uch government we &s;eldom find much indu&s;try. In republican governments he pro|perty of the citizen has generally been perfectly &s;afe. To this we a&s;cribe the progre&s;s of arts and commerce, and the con&s;equent wealth of Athens, Carthage and Venice; of the Hans Towns and the United Netherlands. In tho&s;e republics the governments have not been u&s;ed to depreciate their coin; time will &s;hew how the experiment &s;ucceeds with us. The chief advantage that appears to have ari&s;en from depreciated money is, that fraudulent debtors have been enabled to di&s;charge their contracts on ea&s;y terms. It is admitted that the debts of citizen to citi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">en may be &s;omewhat le&s;&s;ened by this &s;pecies of payment, but the foreign debt is not dimini&s;hed by &s;uch means; on the contrary, while we are u&s;ing

tho&s;e de&s;perate remedies again&s;t one another, our foreign <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> have been increa&s;ing every year. Mo&s;t of our debts have been contracted &s;ince the &s;pring of 1783; if our imports could be com|pared with our exports, the balance again&s;t us would be the amount of our debts; but it is difficult to determine what has been the amount of foreign goods imported into the&s;e &s;tates &s;ince the peace. Our public accounts ca&s;t but a faint light on this que&s;tion. Gene|rally &s;peaking, without a boat or &s;earcher in any of our ports; the &s;tricte&s;t attention not being paid to the revenue, people are invited to &s;muggle goods: detection is not apprehended, and time has nearly e&s;tabli&s;hed the contempt of cu&s;tom hou&s;e oaths The amount of goods imported into Penn&s;ylvania &s;ince the peace and con&s;umed there, appears to exceed two millions of dollars a yea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&punc; In fixing its quote of the national debt, we find, that on the year 1783, Penn&s;ylvania was &s;uppo&s;ed to contain 320,000 inhabitant<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, and North-Carolina to contain 170,000, which is more by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> thou&s;and than half the number contained in the larger &s;tate. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> is true that negroes were taken into the e&s;timation, but these ne|groes were reckoned as two whites. According to this e&s;timation, we &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e that the con&s;umption of foreign goods in the &s;tate of North-Carolina has been equal to more than one million of dol|lars every year. It may be objected that winter is more &s;ever<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"> Penn&s;ylvania than in North-Carolina, and that three negroes <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> not con&s;ume the &s;ame value of cloaths as two whites; this objecti|on is more than balanced by ob&s;erving, that near two thirds of the citizens of Penn&s;ylvania have originated in Germany, or the North of Ireland, and have imported &s;uch habits of indu&s;try and dexterity in the mechanic arts, that they make little u&s;e of foreign manufactures. Divide one million of dollars by 170,000 and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> does not give quite &s;ix dollars for each per&s;on. Part of the inha|bitants, &s;uppo&s;e one fourth part of them being &s;laves, and three &s;laves being counted as two whites, there will not be four dollar for each &s;lave. We admit that the annual con&s;umption of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;laves, in foreign goods, is below four dollars, even when rum <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> included, and &s;ome white inhabitants do not con&s;ume to the amount of &s;ix dollars; but there are many who con&s;ume ten times that quantity.

<P>IN all ca&s;es it is more ea&s;y to complain than to point out the me|ans of relief. It is al&s;o more ea&s;y to give whole&s;ome advice than to adopt proper remedies. It is a downward and an ea&s;y path that leads to ruin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> but it is a rough and uphill road which leads to pro&s;perity; every amendment is at fir&s;t unpalatable.&mdash;For this rea&s;on, I &s;hall recommend with difference, what is like to be followed with reluctance.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="020887_0011_0FB1492EA2B50A50">
We complain in general that <HI>money is &s;carce.</HI> We are mi&s;takes about facts, for the thing alledged is not altogether true. Pride or the force of habits prevent us from di&s;covering the truth. There is not any country in which money may be acquired with more ea&s;e than in America, and every man has it, who has any right to ex|pect it, except in ca&s;es where government interferes; but mo&s;t of us ought not to have any money; we have not de&s;erved it, for we have expended more &s;ince the peace than we have gained, whence it is that we neither have money, nor any kind of marketable pro|perty by which we can pay our debts: No man nor body of men can have either, who&s;e expences exceed their income. There is a plain and certain proce&s;s by which our complaints may be relieved&mdash;The bad effects of indolence and luxury mu&s;t be cured by di|ligence and oeconomy, and the whole of our debts may be di&s;|charged in a few years by indu&s;try and frugality. When are we like to obtain money by &s;uch means? No man can attend to the prevailing conduct of the Americans without expre&s;&s;ing his fear that the period is very di&s;tant. In&s;tead of finding general proofs of indu&s;try, oeconomy, temperance, and other republican virtues, he &s;ees a nation that is more luxurious, more indolent and more extravagant, than any other people on the face of the earth. In drawing this figure, I may be charged with high colouring, but the reader is reque&s;ted to examine the original, and if he finds that we are the mo&s;t luxurious and the mo&s;t di&s;&s;olute of all nations, he will certainly admit that &s;ome re&s;traints might help to increa&s;e the quantity of money among us, or it might prevent the occa&s;ion for it.</P>
<P>Every empire under the &s;un is &s;uppo&s;ed to be independent of any other; that is to &s;ay, the &s;ubjects of every empire are &s;uppo&s;ed to enjoy a natural as well as a political independence. It is pre|&s;umed that they cloath and feed them&s;elves. This, in former times, was obviou&s;ly the ca&s;e in all countries, but the introduction of commerce has produced many &s;eeming variations from the rule. Indu&s;trious nations, who have more provi&s;ions or cloathing of any particular quality than are nece&s;&s;ary for their own con&s;umption, &s;end them abroad to be exchanged for money, or for &s;ome other kind of cloathing or provi&s;ions which they like better, or which they cannot prepare with the &s;ame ea&s;e; but &s;till their exports and imports are nearly equal, and the quantity of imported goods con|&s;umed by every nation, bears a very &s;mall proportion to what they con&s;ume of their own manufacture. This is true even of the Spaniards, though national pride or indolence &s;eems to furni&s;h them as an exception to this general rule. They depend on other nations for many important manufactures. The con&s;equence is obvious. Though the Spaniards po&s;&s;e&s;s the rich mines of Mexico
<PB N="11" REF="020887_0012_0FB14930307CD398">
and Peru, by neglecting u&s;eful manufactures, they are become a poor nation, and they are every year decrea&s;ing in numbers and &s;trength.</P>
<P>We ob&s;erve that mo&s;t other nations maintain a kind of barter or exchange of manufactures with one another, but &s;till the great body of the inhabitants, rich and poor, are cloathed in the manu|factures of their own country. Is this the ca&s;e in the United States? With us the ma&s;ter and his &s;lave, the farmer, the mechanic and merchant, are all cloathed, from head to foot, in foreign manu|factures; this is not becau&s;e we have not hemp, flax and cot|ton &s;ufficient. There is no country where tho&s;e articles are pro|duced with le&s;s trouble, nor is there any difficulty in procuring wool; but our imports are not confined to cloathing: no &s;mall &s;hare of our furniture is of Briti&s;h manufacture. Saws, hammers, hoes and axes, are al&s;o imported as though the wolf had made war again&s;t our iron as well as again&s;t our &s;heep. In every &s;mall town we are cheri&s;hed with Iri&s;h butter and beef, and with Briti&s;h ale, porter and chee&s;e, as though the country did not produce hops, barley or black cattle. Le&s;t ab&s;urdity &s;hould not go on &s;tilts, and folly ride on the great hor&s;e, we make large importations of hazle and oak &s;prouts, under the name of <HI>walking canes.</HI> Surely there is no &s;carcity of wood among us; but our &s;ticks are not <HI>foreign.</HI> In excu&s;e for all tho&s;e follies, we are told, that a man has a right to u&s;e any of the comforts of life which he can pay for. This may be true, but he has no right to u&s;e the luxuries of life which he cannot pay for; and perhaps it may be que&s;tioned whe|ther he has a right to give examples, and introduce follies that may prove ruinous to his fellow citizens. Under the head of luxuries we may fairly include every imported article, becau&s;e this country certainly produces all the nece&s;&s;aries of life. It is hardly requi&s;ite to vi&s;it a large town in order to determine whether the luxury of dre&s;s is become an offence again&s;t decency, as well as a &s;ure road to bankruptcy. In this remark, no particular reference is made to the dre&s;s of either &s;ex, for they are equally attentive to the privilege of being in fa&s;hion. It is true that &s;ome doubts have ari&s;en con|cerning the meaning of the word <HI>fa&s;hion.</HI> In mo&s;t countries <HI>fa&s;hion in dre&s;s</HI> is under&s;tood to mean the form and quality of cloathing, which is u&s;ed by the mo&s;t re&s;pectable inhabitants, or by the great majority of the nation. From late ob&s;ervations, we are taught to &s;u&s;pect that the word has a different meaning in the United States. Among us a per&s;on is under&s;tood to be in perfect fa&s;hion, who is rigged off with &s;omething that has not been &s;een nor heard of be|fore in the &s;tate. On this principle it is that we have &s;een new forms of head dre&s;s, like bullets in a pop-gun, kick one another out &s;o fa&s;t, that we could hardly learn their names as they pa&s;&s;ed in

review. Perhaps we &s;hall be told that an American is not in fa&s;hion who dre&s;&s;es like other Americans; he mu&s;t dre&s;s a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> people do in London. If they change their cloaths once in the month &s;o mu&s;t we. If they wear buttons of the &s;ize of a &s;aucer, in the form of a hexagon or &s;quare, &s;o mu&s;t we. What a pity it is that fa|&s;hions &s;hould wear out in London, before they can arrive at New-York or Philadelphia! If there was a gla&s;s in the moon we might catch the fa&s;hions as they ri&s;e. How does it fare with nations who have no change in the fa&s;hion of their cloaths? Have the wo|men in tho&s;e countries fewer charms, or have the men le&s;s di&s;cre|tion than we have who are &s;ubject to weekly revolutions? Surely the whim of this day has no more intrin&s;ic beauty than the whim of ye&s;terday.</P>
<P>In old nations, where manufactures flouri&s;h, and where wealth is unequally di&s;tributed, &s;ome of the inhabitants being exceedingly rich, and the bulk of them mi&s;erably poor, it is wi&s;e in the govern|ment to encourage luxury and caprice in dre&s;s; by tho&s;e means the wealth of the rich circulates through the hands of the manu|facturing poor. What is &s;ound policy in tho&s;e countries mu&s;t be folly and madne&s;s among us. When we encourage luxury, it is to enrich another nation, and to make our own citizens poor. Can there be a greater trea&s;on committed again&s;t the States!&mdash;The Chine&s;e and Japane&s;e, great, politic and wi&s;e nations, are di&s;tingui&s;hed by a national dre&s;s. The Dutch, though they are &s;urrounded by nations who are changeable as the moon, have &s;ub|mitted to little change in dre&s;s for 200 years. Their commerce does not, like the commerce of France and England, depend on their manufactures, and nothing le&s;s than rigid oeconomy could make them re&s;pectable.&mdash;Nothing but NECESSITY can ju&s;tify us in the u&s;e of any foreign manufacture; doubtle&s;s the word <HI>ne|ce&s;&s;ary</HI> is very ambiguous; mo&s;t people contend that what they buy is nece&s;&s;ary, provided they can barely di&s;cover the u&s;e of it. We have &s;een the daughter of a labouring mechanic perform her after|noon's vi&s;it, dre&s;&s;ed out in more lace, ribbons, gauze and &s;ilk than her father could have earned in twelve months in any part of Europe. Were tho&s;e things <HI>nece&s;&s;ary!</HI> We have &s;een a young Buck, the &s;on of a planter, who &s;carcely &s;old one hog&s;head of tobacco in the year, on his way to a quarter-race, fitted out, for the &s;ake of propriety, with white &s;ilk &s;tockings under his boots, a pair of <HI>durable</HI> black &s;ilk breeches, and more &s;ilver on his &s;addle and bridle, than the value of his father's e&s;tate, if his debts were paid. Tho&s;e were a few of his <HI>nece&s;&s;aries.</HI> It is very ob&s;ervable that in other countries people who live by their indu&s;try&punc; and <HI>are obliged to pay their debts,</HI> do not find &s;uch things nece&s;&s;ary. It is alledged that in England the food, raiment, and other nece&s;&s;aries of a la|bouring
<PB N="13" REF="020887_0014_0FB1493321924CA0">
man co&s;t him annually about 7l. 10s. &s;terling; deduct a moderate allowance for food, fuel, and hou&s;e-rent, how much will remain for clothes? The 'Mare&s;chal de Vauban, con&s;idering what taxes may be paid by a labouring man in France, e&s;timates his annual expence in clothing at &s;omewhat le&s;s than 40 &s;hillings of our money; this includes the cloathing for him&s;elf&punc; wife, and two children. It may be noted that half of the &s;ubjects both in France and England come within the foregoing predicament, they are mechanics or day labourers. Compare their expence with our's in the article of dre&s;s; and it mu&s;t be admitted that an epidemic madne&s;s has laid hold of us. It is alledged, that the citizens of the United States have contracted debts within the la&s;t three years with the &s;ubjects of Great Britain to the amount of near &s;ix mil|lions of dollars; con&s;equently our e&s;tates are mortgaged for that &s;um. Painful &s;en&s;ations mu&s;t ari&s;e to every man who loves his country from the pro&s;pect of &s;uch beginnings. Thus it was that Cor&s;ica was mortgaged to the more indu&s;trious citizens of Genoa for &s;ilks and velvets, and it was afterwards &s;old to a foreign power. We &s;hall be told in excu&s;e for imported luxuries, that we buy goods cheaper than we can make them, and a man earns more in his tobacco or corn field, than he could earn at a loom, or by other manufactures. The&s;e po&s;itions are fallacious and ill-founded.&mdash;Both experiment and calculation prove them to be fal&s;e. During the late war goods were dear, and we did not run into debt, for we bought few&mdash;manufactured &s;ome&mdash;and were frugal. Since the peace goods have been cheap, and we have nearly become bank|rupts. It appears that our earnings in the field have not been equal to the price of the goods that we have con&s;umed.&mdash;Every dome&s;tic manufacture is cheaper than a foreign one, for this plain rea&s;on, by the fir&s;t nothing is lo&s;t to the country, by the other the whole value is lo&s;t&mdash;it is carried away never to return. It is perfectly indifferent to this &s;tate, or to the United States, what may be the price of dome&s;tic manufactures, becau&s;e that price remains in the country. Every man is &s;uppo&s;ed to be employed in &s;ome pro|fe&s;&s;ion&mdash;he is a mechanic, or he is employed in rai&s;ing provi&s;ions for tho&s;e who are. In Great Britain the farmers are to the ma|nufacturers as four to three; in this &s;tate, where provi&s;ions are more ea&s;ily rai&s;ed, the number may be equal, becau&s;e the labour of one man in the field is more than &s;ufficient for the nouri&s;hment of two. Let the manufacturer demand what he plea&s;es for the produce of his labour, the farmer can ea&s;ily &s;ettle the account by &s;elling his provi&s;ions accordingly. The annual con&s;umption of goods in this &s;tate has been e&s;timated at a million of dollars, or rather at 1,200,000 dollars. What is the re&s;ult! 1,200,000 dol|lars
<PB N="14" REF="020887_0015_0FB14934A4433018">
in &s;pecie, or produce to that value, have been &s;ent out of the &s;tate, or mu&s;t be &s;ent, and we are &s;o much the poorer. Suppo&s;e the whole of tho&s;e goods had been manufactured within the &s;tate, or a &s;ufficient quantity for our con&s;umption, and that they had co&s;t the con&s;umers, or been valued at two millions of dollars; would the citizens of this &s;tate have lo&s;t 800,000 dollars by this difference in price! The very rever&s;e would have happened.&mdash;They would have gained, or they would have &s;aved, 1,200,000 dollars; for there was not a &s;ingle dollar to have been &s;ent out of the country. No man is to &s;ay that a thing may be good for indi|viduals which is not good for the public, or that our citizens may thrive by cheap bargains, while the nation is ruined by them.&mdash;He is neither a politician nor a patriot who would u&s;e &s;uch a cloak. Let us turn our attention to manufactures, and the &s;taple of our country will &s;oon ri&s;e to its proper value; for we have already glutted every foreign market. By this expedient in&s;tead of u&s;ing fictitious paper we &s;hall &s;oon obtain hard money &s;ufficient&mdash;in&s;tead of toiling in the field, and becoming poor that we may enrich the manufacturers of other countries, we &s;hall pro&s;per by our own labour, and enrich our own citizens.</P>

<P>IT has ever been found that &s;peculative rea&s;onings are weak and inconclu&s;ive when oppo&s;ed to the prejudices or pa&s;&s;ions of a nation. There is &s;omething &s;o bewitching in luxury and idle|ne&s;s, that nothing &s;hort of hard NECESSITY can bani&s;h them; per|haps this great reformer is not far di&s;tant. When a man &s;ees his fellow citizens po&s;ting at full &s;peed to de&s;truction&mdash;when he &s;ees them attempt to mortgage their whole e&s;tate for a whi&s;tle and bells, and the legi&s;latures of &s;ome of the &s;tates holding a candle to the prevailing folly, by cheri&s;hing the idle at the expence of the indu&s;trious, he comforts him&s;elf that the race is nearly run. It was not &s;ufficient that the whole produce of our country on the la&s;t three years has been exchanged for luxuries&mdash;all the hard mo|ney that could be collected was al&s;o exported, but there was &s;till a remnant of hard money in many of the &s;tates&mdash;the people re|tained it for the nece&s;&s;ary purpo&s;es of exchange, and merchants could not get it out of their hands. In order to bani&s;h this rem|nant
<PB N="15" REF="020887_0016_0FB149362316D960">
of hard money, our legi&s;latures are following one another in making a paper tender. By this happy expedient people will be enabled to ruin them&s;elves, every farthing of &s;pecie, which &s;eems to be obnoxious, will be exported, and we &s;hall be as poor and pennyle&s;s as Tartars.</P>
<P>When our merchants are involved in a general bankruptcy, and when the officious friend&s;hip of foreign merchants is &s;ufficiently puni&s;hed, who tempted us to run in debt, there will be an end to the importation of foreign goods, and nece&s;&s;ity will effect what prudence could not.</P>
<P>I have &s;ome times looked for tho&s;e marks of political virtue, tho&s;e proofs of &s;elf denial which produced the revolution. I have expected to &s;ee a&s;&s;ociations formed by gentlemen in the &s;everal &s;tates for promoting American manufactures. For as &s;oon as we can make our own cloaths and our own arms, we &s;hall be perfectly independent. Surely the man who is cloathed in American ma|nufactures, which he wears for the &s;ake of enriching his native country, and relieving his fellow citizens, may be allowed to have &s;ome claims to <HI>patrioti&s;m,</HI> which is the mo&s;t <HI>honorable garb</HI> that can be worn.</P>
<P>While we are con&s;idering of the various means by which our fellow citizens may be relieved from a &s;carcity of money, the &s;ub|ject of dre&s;s claims our particular attention. Our intere&s;t and our honour are united in recommending a <HI>national dre&s;s,</HI> national pre|judices are u&s;eful, they attach people to tho&s;e of their own coun|try, and induce them to a&s;&s;i&s;t one another. In mo&s;t ca&s;es a nati|onal language an&s;wers the purpo&s;e of di&s;tinction; but we have the misfortune of &s;peaking the &s;ame language with a nation who, of all people in Europe, have given, and continue to give us few|e&s;t proofs of love. We do not count it an honour to imitate the forms of government that prevail in Europe&mdash;why &s;hould we think it honorable to imitate the fa&s;hion of their coats? <HI>"O imitatores, &s;ervile pecus!"</HI> Why &s;hould we imitate the dre&s;s of a man from London, more than of a man from I&s;pahan, P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">kin, or Con|&s;tantinople? Surely we do not mean this imitation as a mark of homage to a Briton&mdash;nor do we pay it as tribute, though it ren|ders us tributary. We do not mean to acknowledge that Bri|tons are &s;uperior to our&s;elves in every thing, whence we &s;hould imitate and &s;trive to copy them. How then are we to account for this &s;ycophanti&s;m? Though it was profitable, we are placed thereby in a point of view &s;o humiliating, and &s;o offen&s;ive to the common feelings of men, that we ought to break the fetters and give another proof of our being free. But &s;ince the imita|tion of Engli&s;h fa&s;hions cannot co&s;t the United States le&s;s than five million of dollars per annum; every argument from oecono|my

as well as pride would &s;eem to recommend a national dre&s;s. What would be the be&s;t form of a national dre&s;s from head to foot&mdash;a dre&s;s to be adopted and per&s;evered in? This que&s;tion may po&s;|&s;ibly be an&s;wered by &s;ome per&s;on who &s;hall attempt the change. If a few re&s;pectable citizens in every &s;tate &s;hould undertake the change, beyond doubt it would &s;oon become univer&s;al. It is true that national dre&s;s, like their &s;everal forms of government, has been e&s;tabli&s;hed in mo&s;t countries by a long proce&s;s of time and accidents; but the Americans have had the re&s;olution to &s;hake off a &s;et of prejudices, and at once to e&s;tabli&s;h a new &s;y&s;tem of go|vernment. Such a nation might ea&s;ily &s;hake off the trammels of Engli&s;h fa&s;hion in the hat or coat, e&s;pecially when it is con&s;idered that great &s;avings and other &s;olid advantages would accrue from &s;uch a mea&s;ure. If a national dre&s;s &s;hould be adopted, we &s;hall have nothing to apprehend from the effects of caprice. We are not to fear lest every adventurer who arrives among us with a new figaro on his back or head &s;hould eclip&s;e our dre&s;s, and claim the greater attention of the ladies. It will con&s;tantly be found that the national dre&s;s in every country, is more decent and more plea|&s;ing to people at large, than any new adventitions o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> foreign dre&s;s. Every &s;tranger who comes among us will think it <HI>be&s;t</HI> to a&s;&s;ume the dre&s;s of the country. If he affects to become a citizen he will find it <HI>nece&s;&s;ary.</HI> It is the privilege of a conquering nation to im|po&s;e its dre&s;s upon the conquered; this becomes a mark of &s;ub|jection. There has been a notable exception to this rule. When the Tartars conquered China, the Chine&s;e had the good fortune to pre&s;erve their dre&s;s, and the Tartars &s;ubmitted to a change; hence the Tartars in that very empire are con&s;idered as &s;econdaries and inferiors. Whether we &s;hall &s;ubmit to the perpetual rule and cu&s;toms of England, and acknowledge our&s;elves &s;ubordinate, is a que&s;tion that is not like to be determined &s;peedily. The pre&s;ent appearances are again&s;t us. I have mentioned the Engli&s;h, becau&s;e it is certain that we do not copy French dre&s;s, though that al&s;o would be folly.</P>
<P>The mea&s;ures to which I have referred would certainly relieve us from a &s;carcity of money, but they are rather to be effected by the &s;pirit of the nation, than by legi&s;lative interpo&s;ition.

States have &s;ought more greedily to ruin them&s;elves, by the luxury of dre&s;s, than &s;ome of the inhabitants of the Ea&s;tern States. Nor is it becau&s;e the trade&s;men or mechanics in tho&s;e &s;tates have any particular claim to patrioti&s;m; for if it be true, that as &s;oon as the legi&s;lature of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts had impo&s;ed a heavy tax on certain imported goods, to encourage the manufacture of &s;imilar article at home, the mechanics rai&s;ed the price of tho&s;e very articles by the full amount of the tax. For in&s;tance, two dollars being the tax that was laid on beaver hats, the hatters immediately added two dollars to the eight dollars they had formerly demanded for a bea|ver, as if they wi&s;hed by extravagance to provoke a repeal of the law, or to promote &s;muggling. If &s;uch reports are well founded, and if &s;uch in&s;tances of extortion are common among the mechanic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> in the ea&s;tern &s;tates, we are not to look for proofs of &s;ignal pa|trioti&s;m among them. The Ea&s;tern &s;tates are particularly cir|cum&s;tanced with re&s;pect to foreign commerce; they produce nothing fit for exportation; the fi&s;hery cannot be con&s;idered as theirs, for it is common, and the trifling amount of lumber and live &s;tock, the produce of the country, that is exported, cannot be &s;ufficient to cloath one-tenth of the inhabitants. In the mean while it is very ob&s;ervable, that no people can be more conve|niently &s;ituated for the purpo&s;e of extending manufactures than the citizens of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, New-Hamp&s;hire, Connecticut, and Rhode-I&s;land. The climate is extremely healthy, nor is it too warm for a white man to labour through the whole &s;ummer. Do|me&s;tic &s;lavery, which has ever been found unfriendly to manufac|tures, does not prevail among them. A great proportion of the inhabitants are contiguous to one another in &s;mall towns, which are the proper nur&s;eries of manufactures; and mo&s;t of tho&s;e towns are &s;ituated on or near a water carriage. The citizens are natu|rally indu&s;trious and tractable; whatever raw materials they want can ea&s;ily be procured from the &s;outhern &s;tates. As the number of citizens increa&s;e in the manufacturing towns, provi&s;ions may be|come &s;carce, but the corn and rice of the &s;outhern &s;tates mu&s;t afford them a convenient and con&s;tant &s;upply. Ve&s;&s;els that are not employed by winter in the fi&s;hery, may be u&s;efully engaged in carrying provi&s;ions in exchange for manufactures; for in &s;uch a &s;oil and climate as the &s;outhern &s;tates, there mu&s;t ever be a redun|dance of provi&s;ions. Surely then it may be expected that the citizens of the ea&s;tern &s;tates will be among the fir&s;t manufacturers. There we &s;ee a people who cannot long per&s;evere in the cour&s;e they have been running; a people who are per&s;uaded by every argument of prudence and &s;ound policy to adopt other mea&s;ures; are we not to expect &s;ome u&s;eful, &s;ome great and patriotic exam|ples from that quarter!</P>

If other arguments are wanted to induce us to promote dome|&s;tic manufactures, and a national dre&s;s, we had be&s;t con&s;ider the que&s;tion concerning imported goods, as it affects our own reve|nue, compared with the revenue of a foreign kingdom. When the &s;ubject is viewed in this light we mu&s;t admit, that our pre&s;ent mea&s;ures are neither &s;upported by patrioti&s;m, nor by any other civil or political virtue. The amount of foreign goods annually con&s;umed in N. Carolina has been e&s;timated at more than one milli|on of dollars, perhaps we may fairly &s;tate the amount of Briti&s;h goods at that &s;um, con&s;equently the &s;ubjects of Great Britain are enriched by our follies, to the amount of &pound;.400,000 the year. How much do we contribute towards the taxes of Great Britain by &s;uch a con&s;umption of her manufactures? This is a que&s;tion that has not been fully con&s;idered, but I think the amount may fairly be &s;tated at &s;even hundred thou&s;and dollars by the year. To &s;ome Americans this computation may appear very extravagant; but gentlemen who have &s;een the burdens that are borne in foreign countries will not think it too large. It is generally alledged, that a man pays fifteen &s;hillings for the u&s;e of government out of every twenty &s;hillings that he &s;pends in England. Some have &s;tated the public tax at &s;eventeen &s;hillings in the pound. Let us take an in|&s;tance in the article of beer. The land pays a tax; the barley which grows on it, when malted, pays an exci&s;e of &s;ix-pence by the bu&s;hel; hops pay one penny by the pound; the beer, when brewed&punc; pays an exci&s;e, in &s;ome ca&s;es, greater than the original value; and all the per&s;ons who labour in the premi&s;es, contribute towards the national revenue by their &s;undry con&s;umptions, to the amount of three-fourths of the whole price of their labour; this al&s;o mu&s;t be charged on the beer. Surely the con&s;umer of beer pays more than &s;eventeen &s;hillings to government for every twenty &s;hillings which he expends in that liquor. But I have taken four|teen &s;hillings in the pound, as a moderate e&s;timate of the &s;um that a man in America pays towards the &s;upport of government in Great Britain, who con&s;umes Briti&s;h manufactures. It follows of cour&s;e, that we have for the la&s;t three years been paying into the Briti&s;h trea&s;ury a tax, upwards of &pound;.200,000 a year. Strange liberality; while our own taxes are neglected, our government degraded, and our private debts unpaid, we are freely giving up the la&s;t farthing for the &s;upport of a foreign government. The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of our foreign debt would have been di&s;charged by a &s;maller <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> than we have already paid into the Briti&s;h trea&s;ury; but our money is gone, and every part of the foreign loan remains unpaid.

<P>IN all governments the relief of the poor &s;hould be one of the chief objects of legi&s;lative attention. Every citizen demands ju&s;tice and protection from government; the&s;e &s;hould not&mdash;they cannot be refu&s;ed; but the poor man has other claims. His wants and his &s;ufferings mu&s;t be in proportion to his degree of poverty; humanity requires that his &s;ufferings be relieved or pre|vented &s;o far as may con&s;i&s;t with the &s;teady and impartial admini|&s;tration of ju&s;tice. It does not con&s;i&s;t either with hone&s;ty or &s;ound policy, that the rich &s;hould be defrauded or plundered for the &s;ake of the poor; but the fi&s;cal and oeconomical laws of every &s;tate &s;hould be &s;o framed as to encourage and a&s;&s;i&s;t the poor in their u&s;ual employments. The nece&s;&s;ary burdens of civil govern|ment &s;hould be &s;o fa&s;hioned as to pre&s;s on their &s;houlders in the mo&s;t convenient and ea&s;y manner that is po&s;&s;ible. The general payment of taxes is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to the &s;upport of any government, but when money is remarkably &s;carce, it mu&s;t be difficult for the poor man to pay his taxes, and in many ca&s;es he may find it impo&s;&s;ible to make the annual payments, without the public &s;ale of &s;ome part of his property. Every di&s;tre&s;s of this kind ought to be prevented, if po&s;&s;ible. Perhaps the mo&s;t ea&s;y and mo&s;t effectual method of preventing the poor man from being di&s;tre&s;&s;ed in the payment of taxes, is by altering the general form of taxation, or by &s;ub&s;tituting an EXCISE in the place of a tax on property, which is common in North Carolina.</P>
<P>That tax, or additional price, which in mo&s;t countries is laid upon certain goods when they are &s;old for con&s;umption, is called Exci&s;e. Thus a retailer of &s;pirituous liquors may be required to pay for the &s;upport of government, one &s;hilling for every gall<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="20" REF="020887_0021_0FB1493DA32E5900">
of rum that he &s;ells; and the &s;hop-keeper may be obliged to pay half a crown for every yard of &s;ilk or cloth that he &s;ells. This tax is very different from the Cu&s;toms, or duties that are u&s;ually paid on the importation of foreign goods. It is a &s;ub&s;equent tax, and frequently much heavier. In many ca&s;es it is laid on articles of dome&s;tic production. In England &s;everal millions &s;terling are an|nually rai&s;ed by an exci&s;e: in France the revenue from an exci&s;e is larger; and in Holland almo&s;t the whole of the national expences are paid by different exci&s;es. Almo&s;t every thing in that country, which a man eats or drinks, is &s;ubject to an exci&s;e: and in &s;ome ca&s;es the exci&s;e is nearly equal to the prime co&s;t. It has frequent|ly been &s;aid, that when the citizens of any &s;tate are obliged to rai&s;e a certain &s;um of money by the means of taxation, there can be little difference by what name the tax is called, or how it is laid; but this opinion is ill founded. The capitation tax or land tax, &s;uch as are u&s;ual among us, are inevitable and po&s;itive taxes; they are not to be averted. The indu&s;trious cannot elude them&mdash;the unfortunate cannot e&s;cape them: every citizen mu&s;t take out his pur&s;e and pay the amount. But the exci&s;e is a negative or indi|rect tax. When it is laid on foreign goods, no man is obliged to pay any part of it; and when it is laid on dome&s;tic luxuries, no prudent man will pay much of it. It will frequently happen, that the mo&s;t virtuous and indu&s;trious citizens are greatly di&s;tre&s;&s;ed by dome&s;tic &s;ickne&s;s; and it will happen that whole counties are di&s;tre&s;&s;ed by intemperate &s;ea&s;ons and &s;hort crops. In all &s;uch ca&s;es, the exci&s;e operates as a relief to the citizen; for he buys no luxuries on that year, and con&s;equently he pays no taxes, pro|vided luxuries only are exci&s;ed. Let us &s;uppo&s;e a very frequent ca&s;e:&mdash;A poor man is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of 500 acres of poor land, hardly worth 100 dollars. His land tax will be 25, and his poll or per|&s;onal tax 15 &s;hillings. Does it not frequently happen that the public officer, at the &s;ea&s;on for collecting taxes, finds &s;uch a man without 40 &s;hillings in his pocket? Perhaps he is &s;eldom po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;o much money at a time. It would certainly be &s;trange if the poore&s;t man in the &s;tate, who is not a cripple, could not earn, in the cour&s;e of the year, three times the &s;um that has been men|tioned, be&s;ides what is nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;upport of his family; but oeconomy and a provident fore&s;ight are not the characteri&s;tics of the poor. In fact, the poor in the&s;e &s;tates are generally poor be|cau&s;e they want tho&s;e qualities: wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> then are we to &s;uppo&s;e a man to have the thing which we ought rather to &s;u&s;pect he has not? Or why &s;hall we make it nece&s;&s;ary for a man to trea&s;ure up money for &s;everal months, who never cared for to-morrow? The land tax, or the per&s;onal tax, may appear at fir&s;t &s;ight to be &s;mall
<PB N="21" REF="020887_0022_0FB1493F24C5E508">
burdens, but experience has taught us that they are not ea&s;ily borne. On the other hand, the mo&s;t indolent or mo&s;t carele&s;s citizen cannot po&s;&s;ibly be incommoded by an exci&s;e. If he &s;hould have no money in the cour&s;e of the year, nor any thing to &s;ell, he will not be able to buy any thing, and con&s;equently will not pay any tax. Whenever he &s;hall be able to buy any foreign commo|dities he will pay his tax in buying the goods, for the exci&s;e is added to the price of the goods: it is paid by the merchant.&mdash;Suppo&s;e the exci&s;e on rum to be one &s;hilling the gallon&punc; whoever buys one gallon of rum mu&s;t pay a tax of one &s;hilling, for in this ca&s;e the rum will co&s;t him &s;ix &s;hillings in&s;tead of five. The &s;ame rule may be applied to every article of foreign make. Prudence would dictate, that articles which are lea&s;t nece&s;&s;ary, and articles which may &s;oone&s;t come to perfection in the &s;tate, &s;hould bear the heavie&s;t tax. The natural and con&s;tant operation of this tax in favour of the poor, is twofold. It is a voluntary tax, and it is a &s;pur to indu&s;try. No man pays the tax, who is not able and wil|ling to buy foreign luxuries, therefore it is voluntary. The man who is diligent, and manufactures for him&s;elf, has no occa&s;ion for tho&s;e luxuries, therefore it is a &s;pur to indu&s;try. In a word, all taxes on property are burdens on the good citizen:&mdash;they di&s;|courage indu&s;try. All exci&s;es, or taxes on con&s;umption, are taxes on luxury and di&s;&s;ipation:&mdash;they puni&s;h idlene&s;s, and promote in|du&s;try. Can we he&s;itate in making our choice?</P>
<P>The opinions of men have been variou&s;ly affected in different countries on the que&s;tion concerning an exci&s;e or a land tax, ac|cording to their pa&s;&s;ions or their prejudices. In England the ex|ci&s;e has been unpopular, becau&s;e the multitude who are poor &s;u&s;|pect that they are chiefly affected by &s;uch taxes. They continue to prefer a land tax, becau&s;e none of them&s;elves have any lands. Doubtle&s;s a land tax is very proper in that country, becau&s;e the owners are wealthy; but in America the ca&s;e is different, the poore&s;t of our citizens commonly po&s;&s;e&s;s a little land.

There was a very hurtful trade carried on between Rome and the Ea&s;t Indies, by the way of Alexandria and the Red Sea.

Augu&s;tus ventured to impo&s;e a tax of five per cent. on legacies and inheritances, which was very productive, with the advantage of being a negative tax. The land tax and poll tax had been long in u&s;e through the provinces, but they do not appear to have been generally impo&s;ed on the Roman people before the reign of Ga|leni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s who &s;ucceeded Diocl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">fian: from that period direct or po|&s;itive taxes became univer&s;al. What was the condition of the Ro|man people under the admini&s;tration of cu&s;toms, exci&s;es, and other negative taxes, compared with the times in which the land tax, the poll tax, and other po&s;itive taxes became univer&s;al!&mdash;it was an age of gold compared to that of iron. Humanity is &s;hocked with the tales of wo that are told. Parents are &s;aid, during the latter age, to have &s;old their children, and to have &s;old them&s;elves, into &s;lavery, in order to &s;hun the burden of taxes. All wi&s;e governments have thought it their duty, on &s;pecial occa&s;ions, to offer bounties for the encouragement of dome&s;tic manufactures; but an exci&s;e on foreign goods mu&s;t operate as a bounty. Suppo&s;e that our annual imports into the&s;e &s;tates are worth &pound;. 4,000,000, an exci&s;e equal to a tenth part would bring 1,100,000 dollars into the trea&s;uries; this would be a very re&s;pectable addition to the revenues of the&s;e &s;tates, and would operate in proportion as a bounty for the en|couragement of dome&s;tic manufactures. It is true, that as our manufactures increa&s;e, our revenue by exci&s;e mu&s;t decrea&s;e; but our abilities to pay taxes by &s;ome other means, mu&s;t increa&s;e much fa&s;ter than the exci&s;e decrea&s;es. Thus an exci&s;e of 2s. may be paid in the purcha&s;e of a pair of imported &s;hoes, which are &s;uppo&s;ed to be worth 10s. the tax goes into the trea&s;ury, but ten &s;hillings, the co&s;t of the &s;hoes, is &s;ent out of the country. On the next year &s;uch a pair of &s;hoes is made in the country; in that ca&s;e, the two &s;hillings is &s;unk in the revenue, but ten &s;hillings are &s;aved in the &s;tate, and &s;ome of the citizens are &s;o much the richer.</P>

In North-Carolina it was enacted, that a merchant importing goods by land, to the value of &pound;. 5&punc; &s;hould be obliged to pay duties on the &s;ame; but a planter might import goods to the value of pound;. 20, though he imported them for &s;ale or merchandize, without paying any duty. The author of &s;uch a clau&s;e mu&s;t have forgot that he was bound to &s;erve the public rather than him&s;elf, and that the revenues of the &s;tate are not to be &s;acrificed to the convenience of a few individuals.</P>
<P>The general advantage of a &s;umptuary law, or an exci&s;e upon imported goods, is &s;o obvious, that I que&s;tion whether any objec|tions can be made to it, be&s;ides the expence of collecting the tax, and the probability of frauds being committed in &s;ecreting the goods.&mdash;Surely the expence of collecting any tax cannot be an object when the happine&s;s and pro&s;perity of a &s;tate is contra&s;ted with di&s;content, poverty, and di&s;grace. If the expence of collect|ing the revenue &s;hould amount to ten per cent. no part of that money would be lo&s;t to the country, and the diligence of public officers might prove the means of enriching the country. In all places, and at all times, it has been too common for merchants to endeavour to defraud the revenue by &s;muggling goods.

<P>IN all ages of the world, and in all governments in which people have been oppre&s;&s;ed, their chief complaints have ari&s;en from the weight of their taxes, or other impo&s;itions of a &s;imilar ten|dency. Some tyrants there have been, who&s;e cruelty has extended to life as well as property: But the common di&s;tinction between tyrants has been, that one of them has impo&s;ed more grievous taxes, or has laid them on with le&s;s regard to the convenience or to the abilities of the &s;ubject. Hence it is that governments are preferred where the power of taxing is in the hands of the people, becau&s;e it is pre&s;umed that they will impo&s;e &s;uch taxes as are mo&s;t profitable, and mo&s;t ea&s;ily paid.</P>
<P>It may happen neverthele&s;s, that in a republican government, the general &s;y&s;tem of taxing, ari&s;ing from prejudice or inattention, may not be of that kind which is mo&s;t conducive to the ea&s;e or pro&s;perity of the people. This I take to be the cau&s;e in many of the &s;tates; and as the &s;ubject is extremely intere&s;ting, the reader
<PB N="25" REF="020887_0026_0FB149455BDD8F68">
will doubtle&s;s excu&s;e me, though I detain him &s;omewhat longer in con&s;idering the particular equity, as well as the general opera|tion of an exci&s;e or impo&s;t, by which the whole of the national debt may be di&s;charged. Part of our taxes mu&s;t be paid in &s;pecie, and &s;ome part of them may be paid in paper. Intere&s;t and prin|cipal of our foreign debt&mdash;the &s;alaries of our mini&s;ters in foreign and &s;ome departments&mdash;and the pay of &s;uch troops as are nece&s;&s;a|rily employed in the &s;ervice of the United States, mu&s;t be di&s;char|ged in hard money. We &s;hall &s;tate the expences of the federal government at 400,000 dollars by the year; for we pre&s;ume that great oeconomy will be u&s;ed till we are able to pay our debts, and that we &s;hall try to be ju&s;t before we are generous. The &s;tates have not hitherto been called upon for any thing more than the intere&s;t of the foreign debt; but the principal of the French loan, as well as that from Holland. is to be paid off by in&s;talments, and the fir&s;t of tho&s;e payments is to be made in the year 1787, from which time &s;ome part of the principal is to be paid off every year.&mdash;Within twelve years the debt is to be reduced to a quarter of its pre&s;ent &s;ize, but in the mean while the payments of the principal and intere&s;t will amount to near one million of dollars by the year. This mu&s;t be paid in &s;pecie, or in &s;uch payments as will command &s;pecie to that value; but there is a con&s;iderable debt which may po&s;&s;ibly be di&s;charged by paper. The annual tax that may be paid in this manner is very uncertain: for though we &s;hould di&s;cover that &s;ome of the &s;tates have, by a&s;&s;uming a con&s;iderable part of the continental debt, and by other means, nearly paid their quota of the dome&s;tic debt contracted by the United States, &s;till it will fol|low, that the particular debts contracted by the &s;tates, or tho&s;e which they have a&s;&s;umed, mu&s;t be paid. Certificates have been i&s;&s;ued for the amount of tho&s;e debts&punc; by one cla&s;s of auditors or another; how is the certificate debt of this &s;tate to be reduced? how is it to be di&s;charged! The&s;e are difficult que&s;tions&mdash;they are beyond the powers of ordinary calculation&mdash;conjecture it&s;elf can hardly reach them. It has been alledged, that our certificate debt bears &s;ome re&s;emblance to that many headed mon&s;ter of anti|quity which defied all danger; whenever one of its heads was cut off, two other heads aro&s;e to &s;upply the lo&s;s.&mdash;Debts of this kind cannot be reduced to the common rules of finance.</P>
<P>We have &s;een that a tax is to be collected annually for the u&s;e of the federal trea&s;ury in &s;pecie, unle&s;s we are willing to forfeit our honor, and give up all preten&s;ions to national character. Is it probable that we &s;hall be able to rai&s;e half of this &s;um by all the various taxes on property? I think not. It is certain that the whole of our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">xes for the pre&s;ent year, after the civil li&s;t of the
<PB N="26" REF="020887_0027_0FB14946A2E9CE20">
&s;tate is paid off, will not produce half the &s;um in &s;pecie required for the u&s;e of the federal trea&s;ury. Let the poll tax, or land tax, be increa&s;ed to three times the &s;um that is now demanded, and there would &s;till be a deficiency; but the con&s;equence would be great di&s;tre&s;s to the poorer cla&s;s of citizens, and multitudes would be con&s;trained to fly into the we&s;tern territory: thou&s;ands would complain of the &s;carcity of money; more paper mu&s;t be coined; that paper would again depreciate, and the taxes mu&s;t again be doubled. Thus we &s;hould for ever be climbing the hill, and for ever &s;inking to the bottom. But we have other objections to taxes on property&mdash;they are extremely unequal&mdash;they cannot be ju&s;tified except by nece&s;&s;ity, and &s;uch nece&s;&s;ity does not appear. Is it equal or ju&s;t, that a citizen who lives near a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ettlement, or one who lives in the wilderne&s;s, &s;hould pay the &s;ame tax for his land, his &s;lave, or any other property which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, as a citi|zen pays who lives near the &s;ea coa&s;t? The la&s;t mentioned takes his lumber, and every thing that his farm produces, to a ready market; the other can get nothing for his lumber; corn it&s;elf is of no u&s;e to him when money is wanted, and there are few things his farm produces that will pay much more than the expence of carrying them to market. Tho&s;e people complain at pre&s;ent, and their complaints are well founded, though our taxes are &s;o &s;mall as hardly to de&s;erve the name; what would they &s;ay if the taxes were &s;uch as the honor and &s;afety of the nation requires? Let us con&s;ider, on the other hand, the effects of a &s;ub&s;tantial tax on lux|uries. As it would be an ea&s;y matter to rai&s;e the whole &s;um that is wanted both for the federal trea&s;ury, and for our own civil li&s;t, by an exci&s;e on foreign goods, I conceive that all other taxes might be given up, except a &s;mall land tax. Under &s;uch an admini&s;tra|tion of the public revenue, the whole of our paper money might be called in within the &s;pace of three or four years; for in that time the indu&s;trious citizen may have di&s;charged his private debts; and as he will not be called on for the payment of taxes, there can be no hone&s;t rea&s;on for making more paper. The immediate and nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence of &s;uch taxes will be the increa&s;e of dome&s;tic manufactures, and the general circulation of hard money. Let us rai&s;e 1,000,000 dollars on the next year by impo&s;ts and exci&s;e, the con&s;equence will be, that on the following year we &s;hall import le&s;s goods, by at lea&s;t the amount of 500,000 dollars, and thus we &s;hall become &pound;. 200,000 the richer&mdash;that is to &s;ay, we &s;hall have paid off &s;o much of our debt, or being out of debt we &s;hall have laid up &s;o much hard money; for whenever our exports exceed our imports, the balance returns in &s;pecie. If any man has doubts concerning the effects of large taxes on foreign manufac|tures,
<PB N="27" REF="020887_0028_0FB1494821814158">
he &s;hould turn his eyes to the Ea&s;tern &s;tates, and he will di&s;|cover, that during the late war, &s;undry manufactures had there been carried to con&s;iderable perfection. We had not been &s;ix months in the enjoyment of peace, before tho&s;e manufactures were all ruin|ed. The mechanic is generally the fir&s;t who perceives the effects of a pernicious commerce, for the &s;upport of his family depends on his daily labour. Hence it is that the merchant may be profited by a particular branch of commerce, and may promote it diligent|ly, while his country is &s;inking into a deadly con&s;umption. It is the duty of the &s;tate&s;man, either to check or to promote the &s;everal &s;treams of commerce by taxes or bounties, &s;o as to render them profitable to the nation. Thus it happened in Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts&mdash;A tax of 25 per cent. was lately impo&s;ed on nails, and the poor o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> Taunton were immediately re&s;tored to life and vigour. If our in|formant is correct, there are at lea&s;t 250 labourers employed at this hour in the manufacture of nails in that little town. The effects of &s;umptuary laws mu&s;t be extremely favourable to the indu&s;trious citizen, who lives one or two hundred miles from any navigable water. In tho&s;e parts the land in general is fertile, and provi&s;ions are cheap, for it cannot be &s;ent to a foreign market&mdash;There it is that the manufactures of linen, woollen, and iron may flouri&s;h.&mdash;The citizen near the coa&s;t may po&s;&s;ibly indulge in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e of foreign luxuries, while he can get them in exchange for a piece of timber or a bu&s;hel of corn; by &s;uch men our taxes mu&s;t be paid: but the citizen, in the interior country, will attend to his manufactures, which may readily be tran&s;ported to any part of the &s;tate, and within a few years we may expect to &s;ee the mo&s;t plentiful circu|lation of &s;pecie in tho&s;e remote &s;ettlements, which are now labour|ing under the unequal burden of taxes. By &s;uch a &s;y&s;tem of finance, perfect ju&s;tice will be rendered to every citizen, they will &s;tand on equal ground, and no man will have rea&s;on to complain, for every man will fix the amount of his own taxes; they will be limited by his abilities, his caprice, or his prudence.</P>
<P>In every regulation of finance we &s;hould have an eye to a va&s;t un&s;ettled country <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> fertile &s;oil, and happy climate invite the foot of the adventurous citizen. The inhabitants of that country, whenever they are formed into &s;eparate &s;tates, are bound by the pre&s;ent federal rule to pay their quota of the national debt, ac|cording to the value of their lands and improvements; or it may po&s;&s;ibly be expected, in order to &s;hun the impracticable e&s;timati|on of property, that their quota &s;hall be as the number of citizens. Is it to be expected, that men who live at &s;uch a di&s;tance from market will, for many years, pay taxes to any amount? &s;urely it is not! Though they &s;hould promi&s;e they will not be able to pay.
<PB N="28" REF="020887_0029_0FB14949A52385C8">
For this rea&s;on we &s;hould take care that the operations of finance <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> any man into that country. Let the citizen have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> in his power to live on the &s;ea coa&s;t, equally &s;ecure as in the We&s;tern countries without the ri&s;que of trouble&s;ome vi&s;its from the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of taxes. In the cour&s;e of time manufactures mu&s;t flou|ri&s;h in tho&s;e &s;ettlements, and the citizen on the &s;ea coa&s;t who ex|p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">'s his produce, may find it his intere&s;t to buy goods that are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">de in the We&s;tern countries. At &s;uch a time we may expect that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">thren there &s;hall, without difficulty, contribute their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the &s;upport of government. In the mean while little can <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> expected from them, except that they may con&s;ume a &s;mall por|tion of the foreign goods which pay tax when they are imported <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> of the original &s;tates. As our manufactures increa&s;e, our imports mu&s;t decrea&s;e in proportion, and before the foreign debt is di&s;charged or before thirteen years have revolved, our annual im|portations may fall &s;hort of 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">0,000 dollars. In this ca&s;e certain|ly the revenue on con&s;umption mu&s;t be greatly dimini&s;hed, but we are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">collect that many articles which grow in the&s;e &s;tates mu&s;t be in con&s;tant demand in other countries, and that our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> is very pro|ductive; whence our exports may be near half of what they are at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> after our imports are reduced to a fourth or a fifth part of that &s;um. Such a change of circum&s;tances mu&s;t produce a ba|lance of &s;pecie in our favour, to the amount of 1,000,000l. every year&punc; and though it did not produce half of that &s;um, there would certainly be a large &s;upply of &s;pecie in circulation, and the balance of our quota might ea&s;ily be rai&s;ed by &s;umptuary laws of another &s;ort.</P>
<P>Such are the pre&s;ent advantages and future effects that may be expected to &s;pring from large and general taxes on foreign goods. Let us contra&s;t this with our pre&s;ent condition and &s;y&s;tem of fi|nance. We have &s;tated, in a former letter&punc; that by the con&s;ump|tion of Briti&s;h manufactures, to the value of one million of dollars, we contribute at lea&s;t 700,000 towards the revenues of that nation, while our own are peri&s;hing; but there are other misfortunes and other marks of &s;ervitude, to which we are &s;ubjected by our pre|&s;ent arrangements, and the general u&s;e of Briti&s;h goods. In the &s;everal &s;tates, to the &s;outhward of Delaware, it is agreed, that three fourths of the produce is exported and a &s;imilar &s;hare of the returns are made in Briti&s;h bottoms. It will be found that for ex|porting lumber and bringing back the returns, at lea&s;t, one half of the property is paid to the carrier. Tobacco, our chief &s;taple, is exported on better terms. They who have &s;hipped tobacco for London, have the &s;atisfaction to find, that after all charges are paid that is to &s;ay, freight, commi&s;&s;ions, brokerage, &s;torage, and a variety of other expences, real or imaginary, there is fre|quently
<PB N="29" REF="020887_0030_0FB1494B237EDA60">
remaining two thirds of the value for which it was &s;old; in &s;ome ca&s;es three fourths of the value have been &s;aved. The freight of the returns mu&s;t be added, and we &s;hall &s;tate the whole, though it is con&s;iderably below the mark, at 32&frac13; per cent. Some part of tho&s;e goods are carried in American bottoms, by which &s;omething is &s;aved to the country under all the pre&s;ent burdens of that trade; for this rea&s;on, we &s;hall &s;tate the average lo&s;s at 30l. per cent. From this computation it appears, that when produce is &s;hipped for London in one of the Southern &s;tates, to the value of one million of dollars, the Briti&s;h merchant draws from that &s;um at lea&s;t 300,000 dollars, under the name of freight, and other contingencies; this money is for ever lo&s;t to the country, and the remaining 700,000 which are returned us in dry goods, mu&s;t have contributed to the revenues of Great-Britain at lea&s;t 490,000 dol|lars. We take them burdened with that expence. Surely our pre&s;ent commerce is of the mo&s;t extraordinary kind. Poverty is not the mo&s;t humiliating circum&s;tance by which it is attended; for under the name of freemen, we are little better than &s;laves; de|graded by national bankrupty; burdened by private debts, and con&s;tantly labouring in the &s;oil for the benefit of another empire. When good and evil are before us, we prefer the latter. We have it in our power to promote manufactures, to bring thou&s;ands of indu&s;trious trade&s;men from foreign countries, to di&s;charge our debts, and become re&s;pectable rich and powerful:&mdash;in&s;tead of that, we are fluttering about in foreign dre&s;s <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">or which we cannot pay; we are apeing the vices of other nations, while we neglect their virtues; without patrioti&s;m and without pride, we are feed|ing other people, while our own nation is &s;inking under weakne&s;s and poverty. Thus we have &s;een an idle and thoughtle&s;s debau|chee neglect the improvement of his farm, and &s;pend his time and his e&s;tate in a tavern, &s;upporting the family of another man, while his own family was peri&s;hing by cold and hunger.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER VII.</HEAD>
<P>IN the cour&s;e of the&s;e letters I have tried to explain the true cau&s;e of the pre&s;ent &s;carcity of money, the &s;ure&s;t and be&s;t me|thod of obtaining a &s;ufficient &s;upply of &s;ub&s;tantial coin, and the &s;afe&s;t method of admini&s;tering the public revenue, &s;o as to prevent
<PB N="30" REF="020887_0031_0FB1494CA3599368">
the poor from being oppre&s;&s;ed while money is &s;carce. We are told by medical people, that in di&s;covering the true cau&s;e of any di&s;|ea&s;e, a con&s;iderable progre&s;s is made towards its cure. It might appear &s;trange, that a fact &s;o obvious as the true cau&s;e of the general &s;carcity of money &s;hould have e&s;caped the notice of any per&s;on; but it mu&s;t be remembered, that when troubles are occa&s;ioned by our own vices, we are generally dextrous at eva&s;ions, and ingenious at fictions; for if we confe&s;&s;ed our fault, it would be expected that we &s;hould amend. Our farmers contend that the merchants are the cau&s;e of all our troubles&mdash;they export the &s;pecie and make it &s;carce. The merchant will have it that our commercial &s;y&s;tem is bad,&mdash;his profits are too &s;mall, for which rea&s;on he cannot pay his debts; but all of them, who are in debt, are agreed that it is hard living in this country. Strange po&s;itions! the farmer buys fineries&mdash;his family are idle&mdash;all the crop that he can &s;ell, does not pay for half the goods he has bought; but he wants more fineries and more rum. He can get no more credit, and he pulls out all the &s;pecie that lay in his che&s;t. Is the mer|chant to be blamed for &s;hipping this &s;pecie, when the extravagance or indolence of the planter could furni&s;h him with nothing el&s;e to &s;hip? As for the merchants, or people who are &s;o called, their complaints are ju&s;t as well founded as tho&s;e of the planter. Thou|&s;ands of adventurers from the Briti&s;h dominion, have added to the thou&s;ands of our own citizens who are too lazy to plow, or labour at any other calling, and for this good rea&s;on, are become mer|chants, or more properly traders. This tribe increa&s;es much fa&s;t|er than any other cla&s;s of citizens; and this cla&s;s we have to main|tain, be&s;ides the misfortune of paying for their goods; but when any of tho&s;e gentlemen find it inconvenient to pay their debts, they gravely complain of the &s;carcity of money, becau&s;e our com|mercial &s;y&s;tem is bad. Certainly part of our &s;y&s;tem is bad; for by proper regulations, nine tenths of tho&s;e merchants that are here might be exchanged for ten times the number of mechanics, who would render much more &s;ervice to the public and to them&s;elves. The general charge of its being hard to live in America, has a wor&s;e foundation if po&s;&s;ible than the other complaints. There is not at this time a civilized country on the face of the earth, in which a poor man may live with &s;o much ca&s;e as in the United States of America. The modes of living are various in the different &s;tates; I &s;hall take an example from a Southern &s;tate; namely, North-Carolina.</P>
<P>The nece&s;&s;aries of life are food and cloathing. Three-fourths of the labour of the human &s;pecies is, doubtle&s;s, employed in pro|curing food. In the mo&s;t luxurious countries, where the greate&s;t number of unnece&s;&s;ary things are u&s;ed, more than half of the la|bouring
<PB N="31" REF="020887_0032_0FB1494E23950DF8">
inhabitants are employed in agriculture. It is ob&s;erved that in England, the very nur&s;ery of manufactures, the farmers are to the mechanics as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">our to three; the difference is greater in France and Germany; but many people are to be fed in tho&s;e countries who are neither farmers nor mechanics. Let <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s &s;up|po&s;e that half of the &s;ubjects employed in farming would rai&s;e provi&s;ions &s;ufficient for the whole nation, and for their cattle; or that the labour of one family in the field is &s;ufficient to maintain two. The produce of our labour is greater, and the labour we employ is le&s;s. Every man who has vi&s;ited foreign countries, knows with what diligence farmers and mechanics are obliged to labour through the year. In the winter their work begins before day, and in &s;ummer it continues through the day. They have little re&s;pite, nor time for &s;pending money. If one of them is acco&s;ted, he &s;eldom &s;tops to an&s;wer the que&s;tion&mdash;his work mu&s;t go on. This is not the ca&s;e in North Carolina, nor have we any examples of what other people call indu&s;try. If my calculations are right, and &s;ome of them are annexed,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">When the land is good, a labourer, by the help of an ordinary hor&s;e, hardly worth 20 dollars, may rai&s;e 750 bu&s;hels of corn in the &s;ea&s;on; he may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">end 2500<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">hills, which will produce &s;ix barrels to the thou&s;and. In ordinary land, he may rai&s;e 250 bu&s;hels, we may take 400 bu&s;hels for an average in&s;tead of 500. Two labourers, when there are two in a family, may rai&s;e near twice the quantity, and one good hor&s;e is &s;ufficient for both. This corn is planted in May, and the care of it is fini&s;hed on July, except that it is pulled on No|vember. One quart of corn by the day is &s;ufficient to make bread for a grown per&s;on; there are countries in which the &s;ame quantity of wheat or rye is the whole allowance of a &s;oldier; and if we lived as three-fourths of the inhabitants of other countries are obliged to live, this would be the end of our calculation; but one pound of pork or beef is the daily attendant on our bread, el&s;e we complain of hard fare. Our farmers plant pea&s;e among the corn, and each labourer may count on the addition to his crop of 50 bu&s;hels of pea&s;e with very little trouble. The planter, and his wife, and three children, may be &s;up|po&s;ed to eat 50 bu&s;hels of corn in the year; fifty bu&s;hels more may be re&s;erved for the occa&s;ional u&s;e of his hor&s;e and his hogs; this is &s;ufficient when we con&s;ider, that hogs not only &s;upport but frequently fatten them&s;elves in the woods. The a&s;&s;i&s;tance of pea&s;e and potatoes is employed when nece&s;&s;ary: the remaining three-fourths of the plan|ter's crop of corn may be &s;old and employed as prudence or folly &s;hall dictate. If any man &s;hall ca&s;t his eye on this note, who is not ac|quainted with the &s;tate of farming in the lower di&s;tricts of North-Carolina, he might wonder that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o allowance was made for the trouble of rai&s;ing hay, oats, and &s;uch other provi&s;ions as are u&s;ually made for hor&s;es, &s;heep, and black cattle; &s;uch a reader may be informed, that the blades or fodder of Indian corn is all the provi&s;ion for this pur|po&s;e that is commonly made by the farmers; for the reeds which grow every where, and are green through the winter, &s;erve as food for cattle. Perhaps it may be noted, that the computation is made for a farmer who has land of his own&punc; but no allowance has been made for the payment of taxes, nor for the rents which are to be paid by the mi&s;erable tenants. To this it may be replied, that the pre&s;ent land tax is five &s;hillings for the hundred acres, and poll tax is fifteen &s;hillings; &s;uch debts are &s;oon di&s;charged by an indu&s;trious man in a country like th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">, where the Spani&s;h dollar, being eight &s;hillings, a pair of &s;hoes is &s;old at 16s. to 20s. The day's labour of a carpenter or ma&s;on, brings him from eight to twelve &s;hillings, clear of his provi&s;i|ons, and corn is &s;old at three to four &s;hillings the bu&s;hel. As for the rents by which tenants are frequently grieved, no account is to be made of them in a &s;tate where nineteen farmers out of twen|ty cultivate their own land. Though there are few citizens who &s;uf|fer under the hands of a landlord, there are many who &s;uffer by the indolence of living on poor and piney land.

He rai&s;ed in the &s;ame &s;ea&s;on, at the u&s;ual intervals, flax, cotton, potatoes, pea&s;e and &s;undry other nece&s;&s;ary or u&s;eful articles.

The calculation has been made for the planter labouring in the field, who maintains three children incapable of work; but in general half the children of every family are capable of work; hence the &s;urplu&s;-age of provi&s;ions by the labour of two hands will be greater. There <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> have a planter labouring in the field, hardly &s;ix months in the year&punc; who in that &s;pace rai&s;es four times the food that is required for the &s;upport of his family and cattle.

Is it not pretty clear that provi&s;ions, the chief nece&s;&s;ary of life, are rai&s;ed in this &s;tate with le&s;s than half the labour that is required in France, England, or Germany? In the article of clothing the difference of labour that may be requir|ed is not &s;o great, but the difference is &s;till in our favour.

Flax grows to great perfection, and the land on which it is &s;own is cheap and ea&s;ily cultivated. Cotton is rai&s;ed with very little trouble; and though the wolf continue to prowl in &s;ome neighbourhoods, yet as &s;heep thrive well in this climate, and require very little feeding, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> cannot &s;ay that wool ought to be dear.

There is a difficulty remaining&mdash;the raw materials mu&s;t be made up, and the people are too lazy to work. Nothing has been &s;aid concerning hou&s;e-rent or fuel.

Our pre&s;ent commercial &s;y&s;tem, if we have any thing that de|&s;erves that name, is certainly a bad one, but rea&s;on may teach us to be moderate in our complaints. If the Engli&s;h mini&s;try had not cut off all intercour&s;e with their We&s;t-Indies, and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed our direct intercour&s;e with Britain and Ireland, we &s;hould have con|tinued a good while longer to take her manufactures and to pay <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> them.

The mea&s;ures of Great-Britain have in a &s;hort &s;pace prevented us from being able to pay our debts, and they have at the &s;ame time prevented us from feeding her own &s;ubjects.

In a few years we may be reduced to a new &s;y&s;tem by which we &s;hall be more wealthy and le&s;s dependent. Perhaps I deceive my&s;elf, but I think that I love my country, and that no man living is more de&s;irous to &s;erve it, but I am not griev|ed&mdash;on the contrary I shew it as a fortunate event, that our com|mercial hopes have been di&s;appointed, and a check given to the baneful &s;pirit of luxury, and the general u&s;e of Briti&s;h goods that was prevailing. Perhaps the time is not very di&s;tant when we &s;hall be a frugal and virtuous nation. We are not to thank Great-Britain for the favor &s;he has done us, for &s;he did not intend tho&s;e commercial re&s;trictions for our good; let her continue to ex|clude us from her We&s;t-Indies, and contrary to good faith to withhold the We&s;tern po&s;ts; the le&s;s we gain by commerce the fewer of manufactures we &s;hall buy, and the &s;ooner we &s;hall make our own cloathing. A nation le&s;s wi&s;e might have di&s;covered long &s;ince, that liberal conduct is mo&s;t profitable, but &s;he refu&s;es to be reformed.</P>
<P>The commercial hi&s;tory of the United States is &s;hort. At the end of the war our merchants, for&s;aking the trade of other nati|ons by whom we had been well trea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">, ru&s;hed into the arms of Great-Britain with a &s;pirit that was not honorable, and with ha&s;te that was not profitable.&mdash;They did not wait for terms.&mdash;They have &s;uffered as they de&s;erved.&mdash;Our &s;hipping has been oppre&s;&s;ed.&mdash;We have &s;een a ve&s;&s;el from the&s;e &s;tates to London, laden with naval &s;tores, bring back, as the whole produce of her cargo, five pounds worth of chalk. The balance of the cargo was ab&s;orbed in charges.

<P>The hi&s;tory of our planters is rather more &s;imple. Di&s;carding their wheels and looms, they u&s;ed nothing but what was Briti&s;h.

If it is true that men have not virtue enough to bear a government that is perfectly free, the proof is like to come from this quarter.

<P>The reader is fully po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the plan that was propo&s;ed in the fir&s;t of the&s;e letters, for giving relief under the pre&s;ent &s;carcity of money. The relief given by paper money is neither durable nor hone&s;t. Nothing but frugality and indu&s;try can bring us &s;ub|&s;tantial relief: but the operations of indu&s;try, and the progre&s;s of manufactures are &s;low. Specie, which is bani&s;hed, cannot imme|diately return; and the poor man, in the mean while, may be di&s;|tre&s;&s;ed for money to pay his taxes. In order to obviate this mis|fortune, it is propo&s;ed that the expence of government be paid by an exci&s;e on all foreign manufactures, or by &s;umptuary taxes which are equally intended to promote dome&s;tic manufactures, and to give immediate relief to every indu&s;trious family.
