<P>MANKIND, when addre&s;&s;ed upon intere&s;ting &s;ubjects, u&s;ually with to know &s;omething of the per&s;on, and his motives, by whom they are addre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>THIS nece&s;&s;ary information, when &s;ufficiently obtained, generally removes all grounds of deception and con&s;equent di&s;&s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>IN conformity to the&s;e &s;entiments, the Author of the following Addre&s;s, informs the Reader, that, he has con|&s;tantly re&s;ided in the City, during the calamity of 1793, 1797, and the pre|&s;ent year: and, has &s;een, felt, and &s;uf|fered much, therein: which, from time to time, has given ri&s;e to various ob&s;er|vations and reflections, that are here pre&s;ented to public view.</P>
<P>THE principal objects, of this publi|cation, are neither fame, nor pecuniary emoluments: &s;ubjects of far greater mag|nitude and con&s;equence; the glory of
<PB N="6" REF="033464_0004_0FF7401CECE92588">
God&mdash;the reformation and &s;alvation of the inhabitants of this City&mdash;the good of mankind&mdash;and, his own peace of mind &mdash;have, as far as he knows his own heart, been his leading motives.</P>
<P>IN attempting a work of this kind, ma|ny di&s;couragements have ari&s;en, parti|cularly a &s;en&s;e of unfitne&s;s and inability; but knowing the terrors of the Lord, and feeling a woe from God denounced again&s;t him, if he did not, in this way, endeavour to per&s;uade men to repent|ance; he has endeavoured to comply, under a con&s;training &s;en&s;e of religious duty; de&s;iring to commit its effects to God, who is able to carry on his de&s;igns in whatever way he plea&s;es; and, does frequently make u&s;e of weak, and ap|parently very unlikely means, to an&s;wer important and beneficial purpo&s;es.</P>

<HEAD>AN ADDRESS, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>FEELING, as I apprehend, an ardent de|&s;ire for the promotion of the cau&s;e of truth and righteou&s;ne&s;s in the earth; and viewing the pre&s;ent di&s;pen&s;ation&mdash;as,</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> A Judgment from God, <HI>Secondly,</HI> A Judgment mixed with mercy. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> A Judg|ment de&s;igned for the puni&s;hment of &s;in; and the reformation and benefit of mankind.&mdash;And <HI>Fourth|ly,</HI> As a Judgment, that, unle&s;s &s;uitably attended to, will probably be followed by more vindictive tokens of divine di&s;plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>I SHALL, in attending to this Judgment, under this fourfold view, intreat you in the fir&s;t place, to view it as coming from God. Oh, the duty, the indi&s;pen&s;ible duty of profe&s;&s;ed chri&s;tians to acknowledge God, not only in all their own, but in all his ways.</P>
<P>IN times of calamity, e&s;pecially &s;uch as the pre&s;ent, as well as in pro&s;perity; the enemy of all righteou&s;ne&s;s, is bu&s;y, very bu&s;y, not only with the openly wicked and profane; but, al&s;o, not unfrequently, with the more thoughtful and con&s;cientious; if po&s;&s;ible, to bewilder and divert their minds from the truth; thereby to deprive
<PB N="8" REF="033464_0006_0FF740C40F39BC50">
God of the glory, and mankind of the benefit, that would otherwi&s;e en&s;ue. And no marvel the ene|my is thus bu&s;y! for of all the di&s;pen&s;ations of divine providence, perhaps, none has a more di|rect tendency to bring the mind home to God. than the pre&s;ent if rightly under&s;tood: but this will be more fully con&s;idered in its proper place.</P>
<P>NOT only the grand adver&s;ary immediately, but likewi&s;e worldly wi&s;dom in&s;trumentally, &s;erves to perplex and ob&s;cure divine truths, agreeably to that &s;cripture declaration "The world by wi&s;dom knew not God."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. i. 21.</NOTE> Neither does it by its own wi&s;dom clearly under&s;tand his operations, either in a way of Judgment or mercy.</P>
<P>THE holy &s;criptures, in relating God's Judg|ments upon Pharaoh, and the Egyptians, mention the in&s;trumentality of Mo&s;es and Aaron, and the Rod of God, &amp;c. in bringing and oftentimes in removing mo&s;t of the di&s;pen&s;ations, excepting the pe&s;tilence. In that, nothing of the in&s;trumenta|lity of Mo&s;es or Aaron appear to have been em|ployed; but the immediate Hand of God, or his de&s;troying angel, dealt the avenging, the irre&s;i&s;ti|ble blow. Some of the di&s;pen&s;ations were attempt|ed to be imitated and accounted for, by the magicians, and other wi&s;e men of Egypt, by na|tural cau&s;es. But the pe&s;tilence, or plague, was a di&s;pen&s;ation; the Egyptians, and even the
<PB N="9" REF="033464_0007_0FF74038067C8D90">
hard hearted Pharaoh viewed as coming imme|diately from God, and bowed before it as &s;uch, and obeyed the Lord by letting his people depart, according to his commands.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Exod. vii. xii.</NOTE></P>
<P>THE &s;criptures al&s;o in relating the plague that was &s;ent upon the Phili&s;tines for detaining the ark of God, mention it, not only as &s;ent by the immediate Hand of God; but, as &s;o viewed by the Phili&s;tines them&s;elves, at lea&s;t by their prie&s;ts and diviners, when they advi&s;ed them to give glory to the God of I&s;rael; and not to harden their hearts, as the Egyptians and Pharoah had done. And though it &s;eems the&s;e prie&s;ts and diviners, afterwards, got into a doubting &s;tate, (like &s;ome at the pre&s;ent day) concerning the great evil, that happened unto them; whether it was the Hand of the Lord? or &s;omething, that came upon them by chance? Yet God, in the cour&s;e of his provi|dence, cau&s;ed their own predictions to be verified in &s;uch a manner, as to prove beyond a doubt, that his hand and not a blind chance directed the plague that was upon the Phili&s;tines and their lords; for removing and ob&s;tructing the in&s;titutions of his wor&s;hip.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 Samuel, v. vi.</NOTE></P>
<P>DAVID in &s;criptures &s;tiled a man after God's own heart viewed the pe&s;tilence as coming imme|diately from the hand of God; for when famine, war, and pe&s;tilence, were propo&s;ed unto him, for
<PB N="10" REF="033464_0008_0FF740CB9B45EF00">
his &s;election or choice, he cho&s;e the pe&s;tilence in preference to either of the other calamities, as he viewed it under the more immediate agency and direction of the mo&s;t high.</P>
<P>AND when the pe&s;tilence came, and David was permitted to &s;ee the cau&s;e of the people's de&s;tructi|on; nothing either from the air, or from any o|ther of the long train of &s;econd cau&s;es &s;eemed to claim any &s;hare therein, but the angel of the Lord appeared to be the immediate di&s;pen&s;er of death<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Samuel. xxxiv.</NOTE></P>
<P>SO in the ca&s;e of Sennacherib, King of A&s;&s;y|ria, who by his me&s;&s;enger, reproached the living God; and by him&s;elf and his army threatened to bring de&s;truction upon Jeru&s;alem: bla&s;phemou&s;ly entertaining and expre&s;&s;ing unbelief of God's pow|er and &s;ufficiency to deliver the people that tru&s;ted in him:&mdash;The pe&s;tilence de&s;troyed the army of this bla&s;phemous and unbelieving King.&mdash;By means of &s;econd cau&s;es? No; they fell by the immediate hand of the angel of God:&mdash;Who in one night, a fatal night! &s;mote with death, One Hundred and Eighty Five Thou&s;and!<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">I&s;aiah. xxxvi. xxviii.</NOTE></P>
<P>OTHER in&s;tances, might be mentioned from &s;cripture to prove the immediate and direct agen|cy of the Almighty in the pe&s;tilence, without the intervention of that train of &s;econd cau&s;es, &s;o com|monly in&s;trumental in the generating and promo|ting of mo&s;t other di&s;ea&s;es: But, the foregoing,
<PB N="11" REF="033464_0009_0FF7403EDD3975E8">
being (I think) &s;o much in point; and as, I wi&s;h to &s;tudy brevity as far as con&s;i&s;tent with per&s;pi|cuity, I &s;hall not enlarge from &s;cripture under, this head.</P>
<P>COMMON hi&s;tory, if con&s;ulted, would no doubt in many in&s;tances, confirm the belief of God's im|mediate agency, in all di&s;pen&s;ations like the pre|&s;ent; but I &s;hall now confine my ob&s;ervations prin|cipally to what relates immediately to this city.</P>
<P>SOMETHING like a &s;pecimen of the pre&s;ent ca|lamity, was fore&s;een<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Thomas Chalkley's Journal, page 205.</NOTE>, foretold and realized; more than half a century pa&s;t: but a kind providential language &s;eemed to be; how &s;hall I give thee up, O Philadelphia!</P>
<P>BUT in 1793, an alarm was &s;ounded! A trum|pet of divine di&s;plea&s;ure blown! A di&s;pen&s;ation &s;ent! Before which, the loftine&s;s of man, was bowed down, the haughtine&s;s of men laid low and the Lord alone was exalted, with many in that day. The men of knowledge, the men of &s;cience, the men of the wi&s;dom of this world, attempted to fathom the cau&s;e, but mo&s;t of them failed; their a&s;&s;erti|ons in &s;ome in&s;tances were not &s;trictly true, con|vincing to others, or &s;atisfactory to their own minds. The fir&s;t report of common fame, (which &s;ometimes &s;peaks true) was, "The plague has broke out in Water-&s;treet."</P>
<P>ON &s;ome of tho&s;e fatal days, about the 10th of the 10 Month (October) 1793: when all faces ga|thered
<PB N="12" REF="033464_0010_0FF740CF8F4EE260">
blackne&s;s, the bands of &s;ociety &s;eemed di&s;&s;ol|ving, and human nature &s;huddered and almo&s;t &s;unk under feeling apprehen&s;ions of God's with|drawing his &s;upport, his pre&s;ence, and his protection from this city: Who, then doubted of his imme|diately directing the dreadful &s;courge?</P>
<P>MOST, if not all, were convinced it was a judg|ment &s;ent by the immediate hand of God:&mdash;And that nothing but the &s;ame hand or power could remove it.</P>
<P>MANY were brought very low, the prevailing language then was, Lord, &s;ave me! Only carry me through this di&s;pen&s;ation alive, and I will &s;erve thee forever!</P>
<P>THE Lord heard&mdash;In the mid&s;t of wrath, he remembered mercy&mdash;The di&s;order &s;topt&mdash;By what means? By the Lord's &s;aying to the de&s;troying Angel which &s;mote the people; It is enough; &s;tay now thine hand.</P>
<P>MY &s;oul is often humbly affected both for my&s;elf and others on account of broken cove|nants: did proffe&s;&s;ors of religion; or others keep their covenants made, in tho&s;e hours of &s;ore di&s;tre&s;s and bitterne&s;s of &s;oul, from the lowe&s;t depths of woe with Almighty God?</P>
<P>THE &s;ucceeding more than u&s;ual pomp and parade of fa&s;hion&mdash;The unabated, increa&s;ed and the in&s;atiable thir&s;t after riches, vanities, &s;inful plea&s;ures and vain amu&s;ements: &s;hewed but too plainly, great forgetfulne&s;s&mdash;great neglect&mdash;great

unmindfulne&s;s, of what was pa&s;t, and great danger of what was to come.</P>
<P>THE widow's gloom was &s;carcely removed&mdash; parents tears had not cea&s;ed to flow&mdash;nor the re|latives &s;igh, forgot to heave; in remembrance of la&s;t year's<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1797.</NOTE> calamity; when the dread alarm again a&s;&s;ailed our tingling ears&mdash;approached our af|frighted habitations&mdash;and &s;iezed our troubled minds. Plainly &s;hewing, that God has neither lo&s;t his power; nor &s;in, its offen&s;ive and de&s;troy|ing nature.</P>
<P>HERE, let us make a &s;olemn pau&s;e! &s;tand &s;till! and, view the wonderful works of God! and behold what de&s;olations &s;in hath made in the City: &s;wept as it were with the bo&s;om of de&s;truction!</P>
<P>ARE not the &s;criptures of truth, the revelations of God to his &s;ervant John,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rev. vi 15, 16, 17.</NOTE> in part fulfilling and verified in this di&s;pen&s;ation. Where now are the rulers of the earth, the great men&mdash;the rich men&mdash;the chief of captains&mdash;the mighty men&mdash; the bond man&mdash;the free man? may not many of them be &s;aid, as it were, to have hid them&s;elves, in the dens, and in the rocks of the mountains? &s;aying by their conduct, to the mountains and rocks, fall on us, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">de us, from the face of him, that &s;itteth on the throne, and from the wrath of the lamb; for the great day of his wrath is come: and, who &s;hall be able to &s;tand?</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="033464_0012_0FF740D7CC982AB8">ARE not &s;ome of the prophecies of I&s;aiah,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I&s;aiah. iii. xxiv.</NOTE> re|&s;pecting the jows, verified as concerning this ci|ty? Hath not the Lord, the Lord of ho&s;ts, taken away from Philadelphia, the mighty man, and the man of war, the judge and the prophet, and the prudent and the ancient, the captain of fifty, and the honourable man, and the coun&s;ellor, and the cunning artificer, and the eloquent orator? Hath not the Lord made the city empty and wa&s;te, and turned it up&s;ide down, and &s;cattered abroad the inhabitants thereof? And is it not, as with the peo|ple, &s;o with the prie&s;t: as with the &s;ervant, &s;o with his ma&s;ter; as with the maid, &s;o with her mi&s;tre&s;s, as with the buyer, &s;o with the &s;eller; as with the lender, &s;o with the borrower; as with the taker of u&s;ury, &s;o with the giver of u&s;ury to him?</P>
<P>IS not this city defiled under the inhabitants thereof; becau&s;e they have tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed the laws, changed the ordinance, broken the everla&s;ting co|venant? And therefore, hath not the cur&s;e devour|ed the city, and they that dwell therein are de|&s;olate; and few men left? Hath not the mirth of tabrets cea&s;ed, the noi&s;e of them that rejoice ended, the joy of the harp cea&s;ed? Is not the city of con|fu&s;ion broken down? Is not almo&s;t every hou&s;e &s;hut up, that no man may come in? Is not the city left de&s;olate, and the borders thereof &s;mitten with de&s;truction?</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="033464_0013_0FF7404BADBEE830">HAS not the &s;tate of the city, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, been &s;imilar to the lamentable &s;ituation of Jeru&s;a|lem, as de&s;cribed by the prophet Jeremiah.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lament. i. 1, &amp;c.</NOTE> Does not the city &s;it &s;olitary, that was full of people? Is &s;he not become as a widow? She that was great among the &s;tates! and Prince&s;s among the provin|ces! Have not the ways of Philadelphia mourned; becau&s;e &s;o few came to her &s;olemn fea&s;ts? Are not her gates de&s;olate? Have not her prie&s;ts &s;igh|ed? Her virgins been afflicted? And did not the adver&s;aries &s;ee her, and mock at her &s;abbaths?</P>
<P>IS it nothing to you, all ye that pa&s;s by? Behold and &s;ee if there be any &s;orrow like unto our &s;or|row, which is done unto us, wherewith the Lord hath afflicted us in the day of his fierce anger.</P>
<P>AGAIN, how &s;olemn, how earne&s;t, was the prophet I&s;aiah, in his denunciation upon, and expo&s;tulation with the Jews formerly? (In order, effectually, to bring them off from all vain hopes, and improper expectations, of e&s;caping the right|eous judgments of God.) When, (in language, no doubt, applicable to the pre&s;ent time and di&s;|pen&s;ation) he thus addre&s;&s;ed them, "Becau&s;e ye have &s;aid, we have made a covenant with death, and with hell are we at agreemement: when the overflowing &s;courge &s;hall pa&s;s through, it &s;hall not come unto us: for we have made lies our re|fuge, and under fal&s;ehood have we hid our&s;elves. Therefore thus &s;aith the Lord God, Your covenant
<PB N="16" REF="033464_0014_0FF740E1987D9F70">
with death &s;hall be di&s;annulled, and your agree|ment with hell &s;hall not &s;tand; when the over|flowing &s;courge &s;hall pa&s;s through, then &s;hall ye be trodden down by it. From the time that it goeth forth &s;hall it take you: for morning by morning &s;hall it pa&s;s over, by day and by night; and it &s;hall be a vexation only to under&s;tand the report. For the Lord &s;hall ri&s;e up as in Mount Perazim, he &s;hall be wroth as in the Valley of Gibeon, that he may do his work, his &s;trange work; and bring to pa&s;s his act, his &s;trange act.</P>
<P>"NOW therefore, be ye not mockers, le&s;t your bands be made &s;trong: for I have heard from the Lord of ho&s;ts a con&s;umption, even determined, upon the whole earth."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I&s;aiah. xxviii.</NOTE></P>
<P>AND may we not &s;ay of this di&s;pen&s;ation, as the prophet &s;aid in another ca&s;e, "This al&s;o cometh forth from the Lord of ho&s;ts; which is wonderful in coun&s;el, and excellent in working."<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">I&s;aiah. xxviii. 29.</NOTE></P>
<P>A PARTICULAR attention to the la&s;t mentioned words, in their di&s;tinct order, may &s;erve to con|vince us, more fully, of the propriety of their quotation.</P>
<P>"THIS" This di&s;pen&s;ation, that hath humbled the pride of man&mdash;this calamity&mdash;this fever&mdash;this pe&s;tilence&mdash;this plague&mdash;or, whatever name it may be called by:&mdash;that hath done, and is doing; that, which nothing but the immediate hand of
<PB N="17" REF="033464_0015_0FF74050EB2E4688">
God could do: in that, it hath &s;haken the king|dom of Satan, to its foundation, in the hearts of many of the inhabitants of this City&mdash;that, in a few days, as it were at one &s;troke, hath brought home to the minds of all (not incurably hardened) the belief of a God&mdash;his &s;uperintending providence &mdash;and, immediate agency in this di&s;pen&s;ation&mdash; That hath done at once&mdash;what days, weeks, months, years, yea many years, of in&s;trumental labours, and lighter calamities, did not effect; evidently "al&s;o cometh forth from the Lord of ho&s;ts," is an in&s;cription, in &s;uch legible charac|ters, as, that he who runs, may read it upon this judgment, &s;o &s;ecret in approach&mdash;&s;o &s;udden in at|tack&mdash;and, &s;o fatal, &s;o univer&s;al in operation: And, as proceeding from him, "which is wonderful in coun&s;el," is one link, in the great chain, of the wonderful counter of God: And, although, at &s;ome dark times and &s;ea&s;ons, the my&s;tery of iniquity may &s;eem very deep; and the kingdom and cau&s;e of Satan ready to prevail, and triumph in the world. Yet all, I believe, is ordered and directed in unerring wi&s;dom; and however low and di&s;couraging, to the rightly exerci&s;ed chri&s;|tian, the cau&s;e of God and truth may appear to be in the earth: Yet, it never was, nor ever will be, totally extinct. But &s;ometimes it appears, that the lowe&s;t depths, &s;erve as foundations for the greate&s;t heights of the te&s;timonies of truth; and, for the promotion thereof in the earth. And
<PB N="18" REF="033464_0016_0FF740E6ADFEFE70">
however various and many are the devices of men's hearts, yet the coun&s;el of the Lord! that &s;hall &s;tand. "And excellent in working." Indeed will God appear to be in this di&s;pen&s;ation; if &s;ome of the excellent productions thereof be duly con&s;idered, in re&s;pect of many of tho&s;e individuals, who have improved it aright. Has it not, in ma|ny in&s;tances, opened a way for the di&s;play of the mo&s;t excellent qualities of the man, and the chri&s;|tian? Such as, &s;aith, hope, charity&mdash;a weaned|ne&s;s from the world&mdash;dependance on God alone&mdash; repentance&mdash;reformation&mdash;clear pro&s;pects and foreta&s;tes of heaven&mdash;triumph over death: and, to &s;um up all in a word, love to God, and love to men.</P>
<P>THESE are the Lord's doings! marvellous to us! And will be &s;o in the eyes of &s;ucceeding ge|nerations! Amen.</P>
<P>SECONDLY, this Judgment may, in the &s;econd place, be viewed as mixed with mercy.</P>

In this &s;ituation, all that many a poor (though pre|cious) &s;oul could do, was the utterance of a groan or &s;igh:&mdash;Lord help me! Or ca&s;ting a de&s;ponding look toward Heaven, for mercy. In this mi&s;ery extreme, I believe the Lord, who&s;e tender mer|cies are over all the works of his hand, has fre|quently looked down from the height of his &s;anc|tuary, and out of Heaven has beheld the earth; not to &s;ee the pomp and parade of princes; nor the vanities and glories of this world; but to hear the groanings of the (afflicted &s;piritual) pri&s;oner; and to loo&s;e &s;uch as &s;eemed appointed both to temporal and eternal death: and in their la&s;t mo|ments, has reached forth &s;alvation:&mdash;and has rai&s;ed them from the depths of woe on earth, to the heights of joy in Heaven.</P>

<P>COVETOUSNESS has intruded upon, and marred, and much injured the original plan of the fir&s;t founder of this City, the truly honourable WIL|LIAM PENN.</P>
<P>ACCORDING to his de&s;ign, (if I am rightly in|formed) no buildings were to be erected between Front &s;treet and the River Delaware. But covet|ou&s;ne&s;s, regardle&s;s of the beauty&mdash;the conveni|ence&mdash;the natural order&mdash;and health of the city; has crowded buildings in a manner, that is incon|venient for bu&s;ine&s;s, and de&s;tructive to the inha|bitants.&mdash;And viewing this matter in a natural light only, and extending our views no farther than the &s;urface of things.&mdash;It would, I believe be a great benefit to this city, if every building of the above de&s;cription were entirely removed: and the vacancy &s;upplied by one or two ranges of low and wide &s;tores inter&s;ected with rows of trees.&mdash; And paved or graveled walks. By &s;uch or &s;imi|lar arrangements; The inten&s;e heat of a Summer's Meridian &s;un: its reflected &s;ultry rays at particu|lar hours from the &s;urface of the river: and cor|rupted and &s;tagnated air from confined and crowd|ed hou&s;es, generally de&s;titute of yards; toge|ther with other inconveniences and di&s;advanta|ges too many and too obvious to be particularly

enmerated: would generally be removed, or greatly alleviated and avoided.</P>
<P>COVETOUSNESS, thus con&s;idered, has mo&s;t e&s;&s;en|tially combined, with other cau&s;es, to mar the beauty&mdash;injure the pro&s;perity&mdash;and endanger the exi&s;tence of the city.</P>
<P>AND here it may be ob&s;erved, that the pe&s;tilence whether originating in natural, or moral cau&s;es, or both combined; has in its three fatal vi&s;itati|ons: fir&s;t made its appearance ea&s;tward of Front-&s;treet.</P>
<P>THESE effects of covetou&s;ne&s;s are difficult to obviate, perhaps impo&s;&s;ible entirely to remove: I &s;hall therefore endeavour to turn your attention to the effects of covetou&s;ne&s;s in points, if not le&s;s fatal, yet more remediable.</P>
<P>COVETOUSNESS, when it once gains an a&s;cen|dency in the mind, is one of the mo&s;t dangerous vices: in proof of this, much might be produced from &s;cripture and hi&s;tory, but I &s;hall principally confine my ob&s;ervations to America in general, and Philadelphia in particular.</P>
<P>What but covetou&s;ne&s;s cau&s;ed &s;uch unheard of cruelties to be committed upon the ancient inha|bitants of South America? and let me a&s;k what but covetou&s;ne&s;s cau&s;ed &s;o many of the original inhabitants of North America, at once, to lo&s;e their lands without receiving compen&s;ation, and their lives without giving provocation? is it not an indi&s;putable fact, that &s;ome of the &s;tates ob|tained

their lands by robbery and murder? and to the di&s;grace of a free and enlightened nation; do not &s;ome of them continue to have their plan|tations cultivated by &s;lavery and oppre&s;&s;ion?</P>
<P>But amid&s;t all the &s;orrows of my heart, it af|fords me real &s;atisfaction to ob&s;erve that this &s;tate was free from this odious trait of covetou&s;ne&s;s, in its fir&s;t &s;ettlement; and the numerous and be|neficial charitable in&s;titutions, which in this ci|ty, far exceed tho&s;e of any other on the continent, &s;tamp the liberality of the citizens, in the mo&s;t con&s;picuous and durable characters. Under this view, may we not, in the language of &s;cripture, &s;ay: if "the time is come that judgment mu&s;t begin at the hou&s;e of God; and if it fir&s;t begin at us, what &s;hall the end be of them that obey not the "the go&s;pel of God?"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Peter, iv 17.</NOTE></P>

<P>THE Sabbath is an ancient in&s;titution prime|val with creation&mdash;appointed to man, for re&s;t from labour, in obedience to the ordinance and ex|ample of God.</P>
<P>IF one day in &s;even, was nece&s;&s;ary, was u&s;eful, for man to ob&s;erve, as a day of re&s;t, while innocent and uncorrupted: How much more &s;o now, in his pre&s;ent &s;tate and &s;ituation? Surrounded on e|very &s;ide with perplexing cares; and be&s;et with bodily and mental imperfections.</P>
<P>THERE are but few, if any, of the different religious &s;ocieties in this City, who&s;e forefathers or them&s;elves have not &s;uffered in &s;ome age or nation of the world, in a greater or le&s;&s;er degree; di&s;advantages, fines, puni&s;hments of &s;ome kind, per&s;ecutions, impri&s;onments, or death, from the iron hand of arbitrary power; for the con&s;cien|tious performance of religious wor&s;hip, on this ble&s;&s;ed day. But prai&s;ed be God! a nation is born! a Government ari&s;en! a Con&s;titution e&s;|tabli&s;hed! of which we are a part, and under which we live; that gives to, and protects all, in a full and free liberty of con&s;cience, in matters of religion and wor&s;hip!

<P>THE affairs of this world, nece&s;&s;arily, unavoid|ably, engage much of men's attention, particularly in commercial cities; and without &s;uch an in&s;ti|tution as the &s;abbath, the mind would be in dan|ger of being entirely engro&s;&s;ed and overwhelmed in temporal pur&s;uits; and &s;ome of the mo&s;t im|portant duties of chri&s;tianity and morality neglect|ed and entirely forgotten: Death unregarded, and a future &s;tate unthought of, and unprepared for.</P>

But the experience of pa&s;t and pre&s;ent times, in too ma|ny

in&s;tances, prove the pre&s;s may be pro&s;tituted to very unworthy purpo&s;es, particularly printing bad books.</P>
<P>THE avenues of education and in&s;truction, are often ob&s;tructed and corrupted by rea&s;on of bad books, by their means the attention of youth is forcibly attracted, and inten&s;ely fixed upon frivo|lous, and often upon very improper and pernici|ous objects and narrations. Whereby the wor&s;t of impre&s;&s;ions and principles are frequently rivet|ted in their young and tender minds: And their lively imaginations, fired with premature ideas, and fal&s;e notions of men and things: Therefore may it be truly &s;aid.&mdash;"Bad Books are a public fountain of vice."</P>
<P>SCRIPTURE informs us, the Apo&s;tle Paul wrought &s;o great a conviction, at a certain time, on the minds of the Ephe&s;ians; That many of them, "which u&s;ed curious arts brought their books together, and burned them before all men: and they counted the price of them and found it fifty thou&s;and pieces of &s;ilver."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts, xix. 19.</NOTE></P>
<P>IF all the vain, wicked and unprofitable books in this city, were collected into one place, the bulk would doubtle&s;s be a&s;toni&s;hingly great, could all their pernicious contents be &s;een at once, no mind not callous to the feelings of virtue; but would be filled with horror:&mdash;But ah! could all their fatal effects; as di&s;obedience to parents&mdash;

<P>IF prudent parents are cautious (as they cer|tainly ought to be) in re&s;pect of what, company they admit in their families, as intimate acquain|tances:&mdash;how much more caution is, nece&s;&s;ary with regard to books?</P>
<P>IN conver&s;ation many circum&s;tances &s;erve to repre&s;s and aba&s;h vicious di&s;po&s;itions and inclinati|ons. In reading none. The mo&s;t pernicious books are generally read with the greate&s;t &s;ecre&s;y: not a blu&s;h rai&s;ed at any impropriety of expre&s;&s;ion: nor perhaps a thought excited, or alarmed with a &s;en&s;e of danger; while the mo&s;t intimate and de&s;tructive connections are forming by means of books: between wicked and de&s;igning authors; and innocent and un&s;u&s;pecting youth.</P>
<P>Is it not an incumbent duty upon every per|&s;on; capable of &s;erious reflection, to in&s;pect their own books; and tho&s;e of their dependants: and to burn and entirely de&s;troy all &s;uch as tend to cor|rupt

<P>REMEMBER I be&s;eech you, how, that in Jo|&s;hua's time, the &s;ecreting a wedge of gold, &s;ome &s;ilver, and a Babyloni&s;h garment; brought trou|ble upon the children of I&s;rael; and proved the entire de&s;truction of one of its families.</P>
<P>OH! that one and all of us, may be induced from the be&s;t of motives, to unite in &s;o laudable an undertaking, as that of effectually clearing this city of bad books; if rightly undertaken, God will no doubt, in mercy to the ri&s;ing generation, crown every hone&s;t effort with de&s;ired &s;ucce&s;s.</P>

Others with|out ceremony, openly and directly attack and de|ny all revealed religion.&mdash;The &s;criptures, they pretend, are a mere farce, a human invention, much of them political fables, calculated to keep the ignorant and vulgar in awe; a&s;&s;uming to them|&s;elves the privilege of being numbered with the enlightened few, who have di&s;covered the cheat. With &s;ome, (as they pretend) God is nothing but a name; Chri&s;t a mere man; Heaven, only an imaginary good; and Hell, a fictitious evil.</P>
<P>THESE opinions, whatever plau&s;ible pretexts &s;ome of them may a&s;&s;ume, are, as they relate to man in this world, directly pointed again&s;t all government, all &s;ocial compact, all that tends to render life de&s;irable, or even &s;upportable. As to a future &s;tate, the&s;e all de&s;tructive principles ren|der it a chaos, o'er which broods more than Egypt|ian darkne&s;s: Annihilation! mental de&s;truction! to cea&s;e to be! are pro&s;pects more terrific, to the immortal mind forever active, and the rolling eye enjoying the golden day, than all the mo&s;t gloomy imagination can paint, or the warme&s;t enthu&s;ia&s;m believe of &s;hades below.</P>

<P>TO &s;uch per&s;ons, few, I hope, in number, as dangerous in &s;entiment, what can be addre&s;&s;ed with any pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s? God's own power, immediately, or man's good examples, in&s;trument|ally, &s;eem the only remedies, in ca&s;es &s;o de&s;pe|rate.</P>

<P>THE mind of man, ever active in the pur&s;uit of happine&s;s, when di&s;appointed in one object, naturally turns to another; as &s;aith an eminent poet:</P>
<L>"Man has a &s;oul of va&s;t de&s;ires;</L>
<L>He burns within with re&s;tle&s;s fires,</L>
<L>To&s;s'd to and fro, his pa&s;&s;ions fly,</L>
<L>From vanity to vanity."</L>
<P>AND after a long and un&s;ucce&s;sful pur&s;uit, not &s;atisfied with all this world can be&s;tow, in this dark and bewildered &s;ituation, the bright rays of good examples, at times &s;trike through the &s;ur|rounding gloom, the mind is attracted to the glory of the light, and the brightne&s;s of its ri&s;ing: On nearer &s;urvey, he is a&s;toni&s;hed to find, that while he has been unhappy in pro&s;perity and adver&s;ity, the chri&s;tian enjoys happine&s;s in both: that what he has been &s;eeking from without, the chri&s;tian finds within; that, while from the mo&s;t unbound|ed &s;ucce&s;s in war, (which engro&s;&s;es to much of our attention) la&s;ting, individual, or national hap|pine&s;s can never ari&s;e: that, while wealth, how|ever immen&s;e, cannot give peace; nor univer&s;al fame and applau&s;e, be&s;tow real content.

<P>FROM a feeling of the judgments of God&mdash;from an experience of the vanity of the world, its in|&s;ufficiency to be&s;tow la&s;ting happine&s;s&mdash;from be|holding the dignity of virtue, and &s;eeing the good man happy in every &s;ituation&mdash;many are at times brought into a &s;tate of inward attention and con|&s;ideration, which, if abode in, with patience and per&s;everance, would be the means, by the ble&s;&s;ing of God, of bringing tho&s;e, who are thus exerci&s;ed, out of darkne&s;s into light; out of anxiety and di&s;|content, into peace, and a well grounded hope of future happine&s;s.</P>
<P>IF unbelievers can receive in&s;truction from the examples of good men, in their lives, they may not be altogether unbenefited by attending to their deaths.</P>
<P>IT is the end that crowns all; and where a man is &s;een calmly quiting every earthly connection&mdash; pa&s;&s;ing the verge of time&mdash;entering on the borders of eternity&mdash;&s;atisfied with life&mdash;unmoved at death! it appears to all a con&s;ummation devoutly to be wi&s;hed; and many are ready to adopt the langu|age of Balaam, "Let me die the death of the righteous, and let my la&s;t end be like his!"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Numb. xxiii. 10.</NOTE></P>

entertain a thorough contempt and di&s;regard of its profe&s;&s;ors. This, no doubt, is highly di&s;|plea&s;ing in the &s;ight of God.</P>
<P>WE frequently &s;ee and hear that the rulers of the earth, when their amba&s;&s;adors, their envoys extraordinary, their &s;ubjects or citizens, are treat|ed with abu&s;e, contempt, or neglect, in a foreign land, denounce the vengeance of the &s;tate, unle&s;s reparation for the offence is made. An in&s;ult to an individual is often viewed as offered immediate|ly to the maje&s;ty of the nation: War &s;ometimes en&s;ues, and thou&s;ands, comprehending the inno|cent and guilty, are often involved in one undi&s;|tingui&s;hed ruin.</P>
<P>IF earthly potentates are &s;o jealous of matters concerning honour and re&s;pect, whether relating immediately to them&s;elves, or tho&s;e under their direction and government, can we &s;uppo&s;e the &s;upreme ruler of the univer&s;e, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing all know|ledge and power, to be an idle &s;pectator, and wholly indifferent about the manner in which his me&s;&s;engers are received&mdash;his &s;ervants treated&mdash; and his communications attended to and obeyed?</P>
<P>MOST individuals and mo&s;t communities have a day; wherein happine&s;s, in its mo&s;t exten&s;ive &s;en&s;e, may be obtained. Adam had a day&mdash;but not being &s;ufficiently attentive he &s;uffered lo&s;s.&mdash; The old world, had their day, but they neglected it:&mdash;Among them, was Noah, a preacher of righte|ou&s;ne&s;s, but he was di&s;regarded; they were too

<P>SODOM and Gomorrha had a day, but alas! it was neglected; till de&s;truction came: though they had a Lot in the city to warn and reprove; and an Abraham in the country to intercede with Heaven. Oh how many reproving Lots, and in|terceding Abrahams, have, day and night, in &s;ea|&s;on and out of &s;ea&s;on, been employed for the &s;al|vation of this city. Some of whom have been mocked and de&s;pi&s;ed&mdash;pointed and jeered at, when walking the &s;treets &mdash;and, all in effect have been but too much di&s;regarded until calamity approached.</P>
<P>AHAB had a day, and although a very wicked King, &s;urrounded by an idolatrous people&mdash;and his public and private concerns troubled with a cruel, meddle&s;ome, unprincipalled woman: which &s;tirred him up to do, what perhaps otherwi&s;e would not have been done: Yet when the Lord reproved him by the mouth of his prophet, he did not mock at religion, nor de&s;pi&s;e his me&s;&s;en|ger; (though he counted him for an enemy) but
<PB N="58" REF="033464_0056_0FF7415115F72B40">
he humbled him&s;elf before God, and his doom was &s;u&s;pended.</P>
<P>THE inhabitants of Ninevah had a day of g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ace a&s;&s;igned unto them: and by attending thereto in earne&s;t&mdash;by an univer&s;al humiliation&mdash;fervent prayer to Almighty God&mdash;and a thorough repen|tance and reformation&mdash;the anger of the mo&s;t high was appea&s;ed&mdash;and his righteous judgments not inflicted.</P>
<P>THE Jews had a day, a long day of grace, but they never fully improved it. They were divided into different &s;ects; &s;ome Phari&s;ees; &s;ome Sad|ducees; others perhaps, of no particular denomi|nation, but mockers at any appearanc of religion. Mo&s;t were too much outward in their perfor|mances, and few &s;incere at heart in the &s;ight of God: They, as a city, as a nation, with&s;tood the law and the prophets: the Son and &s;ent of God, came per&s;onally unto them; but they received him not: they mocked and per&s;ecuted both him and the religion he came to e&s;tabli&s;h; which brought upon them and their city, a de&s;truction attended with circum&s;tances unparralleled in hi&s;tory, anci|ent or modern, &s;acred or profane.</P>
<P>A PROSPECT of which, brought from the com|pa&s;ionate and ever ble&s;&s;ed Son of God and &s;aviour of the world, that pathetic exclamation and dread|ful denunciation, "Oh, Jeru&s;alem, Jeru&s;alem, thou that kille&s;t the prophets, and &s;tone&s;t them which are &s;ent unto thee, how often would I

of their fellow men:&mdash;pacific principles, by rea|&s;on of their advocates intermixing with their fel|low citizens, upon many local intere&s;ting occa&s;i|ons; and thereby in conjunction with the great diffu&s;ion of knowledge, and the improved civili|zation of the pre&s;ent day have in&s;en&s;ibly infu&s;ed general principles of peace, with &s;ome exceptions, into the ma&s;s of &s;ociety.

<P>IF repentance does not &s;ucceed this judgment, can we &s;uppo&s;e it will not be renewed? perhaps with tenfold vengeance! REFORMATION OR DESTRUCTION! TURN OR DIE! is, I be|lieve, the emphatical language of heaven, to us, at this time!</P>
<P>GOD has clearly pointed out to the inhabitants of this city, their duty: Neither the means of knowledge, nor knowledge it&s;elf is wanting. He has favoured us with his written word and holy Spirit; all that is wanting is a heart to fear and obey the Lord.</P>
<P>OUR heavenly Father has not been inattentive to our &s;alvation&mdash;to allure us into the plea&s;ing paths of virtue&mdash;to deter us from the dangerous avenues of vice&mdash;he has, in the one hand, held out every ble&s;&s;ing; in the other, every woe&mdash;in
