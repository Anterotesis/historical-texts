<Q><HI>Zebulun and Naphtali were a People that jeoparded their Lives unto the Death, in the high places of the Field.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THIS Chapter contains a <HI>Song,</HI> occa|&s;ion'd by a glorious Victory obtained over <HI>Jabin</HI> King of <HI>Canaan,</HI> and is entitled, The Song of <HI>Deborah</HI> and <HI>Barak;</HI> The former was a <HI>Prophete&s;s</HI> in <HI>I&s;rael;</HI> the latter by an immediate Call from GOD, was <HI>General</HI> of the Army at that Time; and they both did worthily in their Places. <HI>Deborah</HI> was truly a <HI>Mother in I&s;rael,</HI> by being a Mother <HI>to I&s;rael;</HI> thoughtful and indu&s;tri|ous, even as a tender Mother, to deliver the People, as tho' her own Children, from Oppre&s;&s;ion, and to &s;ave them from Ruin: Yea, and altho' it does not appear, that, in the Day of Battle, &s;he fought with her Hand, yet her pious Soul was in Exerci&s;e, being lifted up to GOD in the Heavens, and doubtle&s;s contri|buted more by her fervent Prayers to the vanqui&s;hing of the Enemy, than <HI>Barak</HI> by his Martial Weapons; and therefore &s;ays &s;he, "My Soul thou ha&s;t trodden down Strength": Not but that the <HI>General</HI> acted his Part prudently, and with a Spirit of true Courage, and had the Prai&s;e of it: And not at that Time only, but moreover, he is celebrated by the <HI>Author</HI> of the
<PB N="6" REF="004788_0004_100DEB7654B18028">
Epi&s;tle to the <HI>Hebrews,</HI> as <HI>I&s;rael'</HI>s Deliverer, and a Man eminent for his Faith.&mdash;And it may not pa&s;s un|ob&s;erved, that the <HI>Governours</HI> of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> offer'd them|&s;elves, at that Juncture, to &s;erve in the War; and by &s;o doing won the Heart of the Prophete&s;s, and &s;he gave GOD the Prai&s;e of it; as al&s;o, becau&s;e the <HI>Peo|ple</HI> offer'd them&s;elves &s;o very willingly.&mdash;Particular Mention is here made of the &s;everal Tribes which a&s;&s;i&s;ted, as <HI>Ephraim</HI> and <HI>Benjamin, Machir</HI> and <HI>Zebu|lon, I&s;&s;achar</HI> and <HI>Napthali:</HI> But then, alas! &s;ome there were which <HI>declin'd</HI> the Service, as <HI>Reuben, partly,</HI> becau&s;e of the Divi&s;ions among them, but whether the Conte&s;t was between them&s;elves, or with the other Tribes, is uncertain; and <HI>partly,</HI> by Rea&s;on of their &s;ecular Occa&s;ions, or becau&s;e they cho&s;e to pur&s;ue their own private, rather than to promote the public Inte|re&s;t: And truly, a contentious, as al&s;o a covetous and worldly Spirit, very often proves the unhappy Occa|&s;ion of Per&s;ons refu&s;ing to lend a Hand to promote the public Weal. <HI>Dan</HI> and <HI>A&s;her</HI> al&s;o declined; but <HI>Meroz</HI> is e&s;pecially condemned and cur&s;ed; and the Cur&s;e, it &s;eems, took effect, for we read no more of it: Not, that GOD wanted their help; No; for rather than not accompli&s;h his own Work, "the Stars from Heaven mu&s;t fight in their Cour&s;es"; which may probably refer to the Thunder, Lightning, and Storms of Hail &s;ent at that Time, and on that Occa&s;ion: Yea, and not the Heavens only, but al&s;o the Waters under the Heavens, and in particular, the ancient River <HI>Ki&s;hon</HI> mini&s;tred to the Salvation of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> by &s;weeping away and drowning a Multitude of the Ene|my, who probably e&s;&s;ay'd to pa&s;s over to the other Side, and &s;o e&s;cape.&mdash;And then, the Prophete&s;s goes on to give <HI>Jael,</HI> her Si&s;ter-Heroe, the Prai&s;e of her valorous Act, in putting a full End to <HI>Si&s;era'</HI>s troubling of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> by Means of her deadly Nail and Hammer: And having &s;poken of the Di&s;appointment, which
<PB N="7" REF="004788_0005_100DECD18E8652A0">
would thereby en&s;ue to his Mother and the other Ladies of the Court, &s;he concludes with a pathetick Reque&s;t to GOD, for the like De&s;truction of all his Enemies; and for the Encouragement and Salvation of all true I&s;raelites.</P>
<P>AND now, O how much does it redound to the Honour of this <HI>Mother in I&s;rael,</HI> that &s;he di&s;claimed all Right to the Honour of that great Exploit! As &s;he had been fir&s;t in the Action, &s;o al&s;o &s;he now leads in the Thank&s;giving, &s;aying in effect, "Not unto me, Not unto us, but to thy Name, O LORD, be the Glory." Ver&s;es 2d and 3d, "Prai&s;e ye the LORD for the avenging of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> when the People willingly offered them. Hear O ye Kings, give Ear O ye Princes, I, even I will &s;ing unto the LORD, I will &s;ing Prai&s;e unto the LORD GOD of <HI>I&s;rael.</HI>"&mdash;And truly, all the People had abundant Rea&s;on, for a long Time after, to remember this Victory with repeated Thank&s;givings; for, it not only brought them a pre|&s;ent happy Peace and Quiet, but moreover, the whole Land had Re&s;t for the Space of <HI>Forty</HI> Years.</P>
<P>BUT <HI>Zebulon</HI> and <HI>Napthali</HI> &s;eem to have di&s;tin|gui&s;hed them&s;elves, on that Day, by their Boldne&s;s and Activity: They were the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> that offered for that Service, moved thereunto, it's probable, partly from the Con&s;ideration of <HI>Barak'</HI>s belonging to one of tho&s;e Tribes, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> that of <HI>Napthali;</HI> but much more from the Sen&s;e which they had, above any other, of the Hard&s;hip of enduring the Yoke, they lying neare&s;t to the Oppre&s;&s;or: The&s;e People being &s;pirited from above, cho&s;e rather to die like Men, than to live any longer like Va&s;&s;als to the vile&s;t of Men; and therefore, fir'd with Zeal for GOD, and their Coun|try, they &s;oon li&s;ted into the Service, and being thus enter'd, they would not baulk &s;o good a Cau&s;e, but in the Day of Battle, jeoparded their Lives to the Death in the high Places of the Field; or, in the plain and
<PB N="8" REF="004788_0006_100DECD31C793328">
open Field.&mdash;Indeed <HI>Barak'</HI>s Orders were to take <HI>Ten Thou&s;and</HI> Men out of the&s;e two Tribes, and then pro|ceed; but becau&s;e &s;ome out of &s;ome of the other Tribes <HI>willingly</HI> offered them&s;elves, therefore they were accepted: However, <HI>Zebulon</HI> and <HI>Naphtali</HI> were doubtle&s;s the <HI>Van-guard,</HI> appointed to that Place by their General, yea and choo&s;ing it rather than any other, altho' the Place of greate&s;t Danger: And be|hold, they did not, in the <HI>Day</HI> of Battle, &s;hrink back nor &s;eek to flee, but like Men filled with heroick Courage, pu&s;h'd on, and having &s;et their Faces like a Flint, they encounter'd even the Chariots of Iron with|out dread of Danger, and di&s;dain'd the King of Ter|rors him&s;elf in &s;o ju&s;t a Cau&s;e.&mdash;It is &s;aid indeed, that they <HI>jeoparded their Lives</HI>&mdash;; but the goodne&s;s of their Cau&s;e made them quite unmindful of their Dan|ger, being fully determined either to conquer, or die on the Spot.</P>
<P>AND now, it is obvious to us all, that this was &s;poken, and is here recorded, by way of <HI>Commenda|tion to them,</HI> that they were thus forward and valorous; and al&s;o, as a great <HI>Favour of GOD to I&s;rael,</HI> that they had &s;uch Men among their Tribes: So that, we may take this for our OBSERVATION,</P>
<P>THAT when a Number of Men do in a ju&s;t Cau&s;e, and there is urgent Nece&s;&s;ity for it, jeopard their Lives to the Death, in behalf of their Country, it affords Matter of <HI>Thank&s;giving unto GOD,</HI> and <HI>Com|mendation to &s;uch Men.</HI></P>
<P>AND our Ob&s;ervation will hold true, as to tho&s;e who jeopard their Lives upon the <HI>mighty Waters,</HI> as well as to &s;uch who do &s;o in the <HI>Field</HI> of Battle.</P>
<P>AND this may be &s;poken to, as the Time &s;hall admit, under <HI>Four General Heads.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="004788_0007_100DECD5A13CBE48">
I. THAT the Church and People of GOD have Enemies to Encounter.</P>
<P>II. IT is lawful, and &s;ometimes highly nece&s;&s;ary, for the People of GOD, &s;ome of them at lea&s;t, to take up Arms and go forth to War.</P>
<P>III. A Soldier's Life is in very great Jeopardy, e&s;pecially in the Field of Battle.</P>
<P>IV. THAT when a Number of Men do in a ju&s;t Cau&s;e, and there be Nece&s;&s;ity for it, jeopard their Lives to the Death, in behalf of their Country, it affords Matter of Thank&s;giving unto GOD, and Commendation to &s;uch Men.</P>
<P>SOMETHING I &s;hall &s;ay to <HI>Each</HI> of the&s;e; then, offer a few Words by way of <HI>Addre&s;s</HI> to the honourable <HI>Artillery Company;</HI> and then conclude with &s;ome Advice to tho&s;e, who are about to engage in the <HI>Spiri|tual Warfare</HI> under Him who is &s;tronger than the &s;trong Man armed.&mdash;And all with my u&s;ual and affected Plainne&s;s of Speech.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> THE Church and People of GOD have Enemies to Encounter.</P>
<P>PARTICULAR Chri&s;tians have their Enemies, and meet with their Troubles in the World, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> Per&s;onal Troubles both inward and outward; and &s;ometimes Dome&s;tick Troubles of one kind and another, too many, yea, and &s;ome of them <HI>too bad,</HI> to be here re|cited:&mdash;And be&s;ides the&s;e, the People of GOD have oftentimes <HI>open</HI> and profe&s;&s;ed Enemies to encounter; &s;o that the Church on Earth may fitly be &s;tiled the Church militant, to di&s;tingui&s;h from the Church tri|umphant. It is true indeed, GOD's People do not delight in War, or to breed and continue Strifes with their Fellow-Mortals; No; but they are oftentimes obliged to &s;trive and fight, to kill or be killed.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="004788_0008_100DECD81BF322D8">
AND as for their Enemies <HI>at this Day,</HI> they are &s;uch as are not only Enemies to their outward <HI>Pro&s;pe|rity,</HI> &s;eeking to impoveri&s;h them by preying on their Sub&s;tance and making Spoil of their E&s;tates; as al&s;o, Enemies to their <HI>Liberty,</HI> &s;eeking to captivate and &s;ometimes to retain them in Slavery and cruel Bon|dage: But moreover, they are Enemies al&s;o, to that pure and holy <HI>Religion</HI> which they make Profe&s;&s;ion of, and accordingly u&s;e their utmo&s;t Endeavours to bring the true Wor&s;hippers to a fal&s;e Way and Man|ner of Wor&s;hip, even to pay divine Homage unto Creatures not able to help and &s;ave: Yea, they would de&s;troy, if they could, even to the Foundation, &s;uch as have not their Mark, and do di&s;claim the <HI>Pope'</HI>s Supremacy; their Language is much like that of the Children of <HI>Edom</HI> in the Day of <HI>Jeru&s;alem'</HI>s Trouble, in <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 137. 7. <HI>Ra&s;e it, ra&s;e it even to the Founda|tion:</HI> And this leads me to &s;ay, that they are Ene|mies to the very <HI>Lives</HI> of GOD's People: Their tender Mercies are Cruelty, and that the rather, be|cau&s;e they are in&s;tructed, and do embrace it as an Article of their Creed, That to de&s;troy Prote&s;tants is to do GOD and the Church good Service.</P>
<P>AND truly, not only now, but even <HI>all along,</HI> the Church of GOD has had her Enemies, namely, the <HI>Egyptians,</HI> the <HI>Canaanites,</HI> the <HI>Babylonians,</HI> the <HI>Greci|ans,</HI> and the <HI>Romans,</HI> of old:&mdash;And as for the Primi|tive Chri&s;tians, they were per&s;ecuted by the <HI>Heathen</HI> Emperors, at no le&s;s than <HI>Ten</HI> &s;everal Periods; which were no &s;ooner over, but the <HI>Arians</HI> aro&s;e, who altho' they called them&s;elves Chri&s;tians, yet per&s;ecuted the Orthodox wor&s;e than ever profe&s;&s;ed <HI>Pagans</HI> had done; in&s;omuch, that the Church was in imminent Hazard of being &s;wallowed up by that Flood. And after|wards <HI>Antichri&s;t</HI> aro&s;e, known by the Name of the Man of Sin, who has per&s;ecuted more than all that were before him: Yea, and as the Quarrel between
<PB N="11" REF="004788_0009_100DECDB65CA4160">
the Kingdom of GOD and the Kingdom of Satan among Men, commenced from the Day of the fir&s;t and grand Apo&s;tacy, &s;o we may depend upon it, that as long as there is a <HI>Pope</HI> in <HI>Rome,</HI> there will be Days of Trouble to the Church of GOD on Earth.</P>
<P>AND now, If it be enquired, <HI>Who</HI> it is that &s;tirs up Men to appear as Enemies to the Church of GOD? I reply; That the <HI>LORD of Ho&s;ts</HI> orders and over rules in this Matter: The Sword is one of GOD's &s;ore Judgments; and agreably, we often read, that it was the LORD who &s;tirred up one Nation and another to vex and di&s;turb his People <HI>I&s;rael:</HI> And even &s;o it is at <HI>this</HI> Day.&mdash;But then, it is proper to add, that altho' the Enemies of GOD's People &s;eek to impoveri&s;h and even to extirpate them, yet, the mo&s;t High has wi&s;e and good Ends herein: He does it for his own <HI>Honour</HI> and <HI>Glory,</HI> to magnify his Name, and to make glorious his Attributes, and more e&s;pecially his <HI>Holine&s;s,</HI> for hereby he clearly and aw|fully te&s;tifies his Hatred of Sin, and his &s;ore Di&s;plea|&s;ure again&s;t Sinners: Al&s;o at &s;uch a Time, he takes the Opportunity to glorify his <HI>Wi&s;dom</HI> and <HI>Power</HI> in pre&s;erving his Church amid&s;t &s;o many Dangers, which may well be look'd upon as one of the great Won|ders of divine Providence, and even like the Bu&s;h burning and yet not con&s;umed: Yea, and I may truly add, that the People of GOD <HI>them&s;elves</HI> are wont to glorify him in Days of Adver&s;ity more than at other Times: In the primitive State of the Chri&s;tian Church, which was a Time of much Tribulation, how greatly was the Kingdom of CHRIST advanced, and his intere&s;t promoted in the World, beyond what it was when a pro&s;perous State came on.&mdash;In a Word, GOD Almighty's Intent is not to de&s;troy his Church, No, but rather that the Faith and Patience, Courage and Fidelity of his Servants may for a Sea&s;on be prov'd and improv'd, and be found to Prai&s;e and
<PB N="12" REF="004788_0010_100DECDD2F300078">
Honour and Glory: And doubtle&s;s, the Judge of all the Earth is <HI>Righteous</HI> in the&s;e his Di&s;pen&s;ations, for the very be&s;t of Men need to be purged that &s;o they may bring forth more Fruit; and as for the People of GOD in general, they &s;tand in need of Correction in Order to their Reformation.&mdash;And it may not be ami&s;s to add, that the glorious God has an Eye herein to his People's <HI>Enemies</HI> al&s;o, even to weaken and wa&s;te, and &s;ometimes utterly to de&s;troy them, or a con&s;iderable Branch of their Power.</P>
<P>HENCE then we may <HI>infer,</HI> That External Peace and Pro&s;perity is not a &s;ure Evidence of a true Church.&mdash;Some have been too apt to break Charity with particular Per&s;ons, becau&s;e they have been exerci&s;ed with many and grievous afflictions in the World; <HI>Job'</HI>s <HI>Friends</HI> (for In&s;tance) were inclined to cen&s;ure and even condemn him on this very Account, but they were upon a wrong Foundation, and were &s;oon convinced of it: And truly, it was Matter of Stum|bling to the holy <HI>P&s;almi&s;t,</HI> to ob&s;erve, that, ordinarily, good People had a larger Share of Trouble di&s;pen&s;ed to them than others had, "until he went into the Sanctuary of GOD, where he &s;oon under&s;tood what was to be the End of the wicked, namely, that they were exalted, that &s;o their Fall might be the more grievous and infamous."&mdash;And as it is a Truth with re&s;pect to particular Per&s;ons, that the Righteous may be in Adver&s;ity, and the Wicked in Pro&s;perity, &s;o al&s;o as to <HI>Societies;</HI> and therefore, a true Church may be afflicted and per&s;ecuted, and even almo&s;t de&s;troyed; and at the &s;ame Time, a fal&s;e Church may be in great Power and Splendor.&mdash;If we <HI>review</HI> the State of the Church of GOD under the <HI>Old Te&s;tament,</HI> how fre|quently and how grievou&s;ly was &s;he afflicted. <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 129. 1, 2, 3. "Many a Time have they afflicted me from my Youth may I&s;rael now &s;ay; many a Time have they afflicted me from my Youth,&mdash;the
<PB N="13" REF="004788_0011_100DECE1829623D0">
Plowers plowed upon my Back, they made long their Furrows." And &s;o, if we con&s;ider <HI>again</HI> the State of the Church under the <HI>New Te&s;tament,</HI> we &s;hall find, that many a Time "&s;he was killed all the Day long, and, for CHRIST'S &s;ake, was counted as Sheep for the Slaughter." The Primitive Chri&s;tians (tho' in Reality, the be&s;t, yet) were repre&s;ented to the World as the very wor&s;t of Men, and accordingly, unto them was given the mo&s;t barbarous Treatment; &s;o that the Continuance of the true Chri&s;tian Religion down to this Day, de&s;erves, as was before noted, to be look'd upon as a &s;tanding Miracle: Yea, when we revolve in our Minds, how Earth and Hell combin'd, what a mighty Force was rai&s;ed, what Books were written, and what Laws were made, again&s;t the Church, even in its Infancy, we mu&s;t needs &s;ay, It is the LORD'S doing that &s;he is pre&s;erved, and it ought to be mar|vellous in our Eyes: Behold, "This is GOD'S He|ritage, which hath been as a &s;peckled Bird, and which all the Birds round about have been, and &s;till are, again&s;t:" Nor may the Church expect to be at Re&s;t for any con&s;iderable Space of Time together, until the Man of Sin be taken out of the Way.&mdash;True indeed, it was the Expectation of the generality of GOD's ancient People, that the Kingdom of the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah</HI> would be a Temporal Kingdom, attended with worldly Pomp and Power, and that all Nations would, &s;peedily after his appearing, be &s;ubdued under him, and that there would be and continue to be a univer&s;al Peace; and not only &s;o, but moreover, that the People of the <HI>Jews</HI> would be Chief and Prince&s;s among the Nations: But, this was no other than a vain Dream, for altho' it is true, that there was an univer&s;al Peace in the Empire when the true <HI>Me&s;&s;iah</HI> was born, and therefore the Temple of <HI>Janus</HI> was then &s;hut; yet, our Saviour him&s;elf expre&s;ly &s;aid, "My Kingdom is not of this World," and cautioned
<PB N="14" REF="004788_0012_100DECE3B403CFA8">
his Di&s;ciples, &s;aying, "Think not that I am come to &s;end Peace," i. e. External Peace and Pro&s;perity: Yea, and he foretold, "that there would be great Commotions among the Nations, Wars, and Rumours of Wars," which Prediction of his has been &s;ince abundantly verified, and is &s;o at <HI>this</HI> Day.&mdash;A way then with that fal&s;e Po&s;ition, namely, That External Peace and Grandeur is a &s;ure Note of the true Church:&mdash;And let not any vainly imagine, that by li&s;ting under CHRIST'S Banner, they &s;hall be exempt from outward Troubles, or get out of the reach of per&s;ecuting Foes; No, No; for &s;ays our Saviour, "in the World you &s;hall have Trouble;" and "who|&s;oever will come after me, let him deny him&s;elf, and take up his Cro&s;s and follow me:" Chri&s;tians mu&s;t expect not only inward and &s;piritual, but al&s;o outward and bodily Troubles, even Troubles from the World as well as from the Fle&s;h and Devil: Which I here mention, not to di&s;courage any of you from walking in the right Ways of the LORD, but that you may not be &s;urprized when &s;uch Days of Trouble come on, and to de&s;ert that good Cau&s;e which you profe&s;s to e&s;pou&s;e: Your be&s;t way is to expect and prepare for Troubles of one kind and another, that &s;o you may glorify GOD in and under them, and may al&s;o &s;ee a glorious I&s;&s;ue of the &s;ame; that is, either be deli|ver'd <HI>from</HI> them to your own &s;piritual Advantage, or be deliver'd <HI>by</HI> them out of the reach of all Evils both moral and paenal.&mdash;Which leads me to &s;ay, Oh! How much more de&s;ireable is <HI>Heaven</HI> than Earth! And, Oh! how ardently &s;hould the Saints of the mo&s;t High long to be there, and be giving all Diligence to make their Calling and Election &s;ure! You may be &s;ure that there are no Conte&s;ts there; No; for the Inhabitants of that better Country are cordial Friends to one another, and unfeignedly delight in each other's Society. There is nothing at all to offend or

<P>I proceed now to the <HI>Second</HI> general Head, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> That it is lawful, and &s;ometimes highly nece&s;&s;ary, for the People of GOD, &s;ome of them at lea&s;t, to take up Arms and go forth to War.</P>

<P>THAT it is a Thing <HI>lawful</HI> on &s;ome Occa&s;ions to go forth to War, is undeniable; ina&s;much as we not only find the People of GOD &s;o doing in Days of old, but moreover, that they were directed and com|manded by the mo&s;t High him&s;elf to do &s;o: I &s;up|po&s;e I need not &s;tand to cite Texts of Scripture for the Proof of this; any Child that has read the Hi&s;to|rical Part of the Holy Bible can't but know that there are very many to this Purpo&s;e: Neither is it counter-manded by any Text in the New-Te&s;tament. And,</P>
<P>NOT only is it <HI>lawful,</HI> but &s;ometimes highly <HI>ne|ce&s;&s;ary</HI> to go forth to War; namely, that &s;o the Peo|ple of GOD may pre&s;erve and defend the pure Wor|&s;hip of GOD among them&s;elves again&s;t bold Corrup|ters: As al&s;o, that they may deliver &s;uch as are per&s;e|cuted for Righteou&s;ne&s;s &s;ake from violent Oppre&s;&s;ors: And it is even &s;ometimes nece&s;&s;ary for the recovering, and &s;o for the defending of Lands and Goods; but rather for the defending of Lives and Liberties, and the recovering of Captives:&mdash;But then, when-ever we take up Arms, either for the Defence or the Recovery
<PB N="16" REF="004788_0014_100DECEAF3B38110">
of our Cities and People, we &s;hould learn to con&s;ider them not only as ours, but as the Cities and People of our <HI>GOD.</HI></P>
<P>YEA, it may be &s;ometimes nece&s;&s;ary for People to take up Arms again&s;t <HI>their own Country-men;</HI> I mean, again&s;t &s;uch as go about to de&s;troy the pure Religion, and to introduce and impo&s;e the wor&s;hipping of <HI>fal&s;e Gods.</HI>&mdash;Al&s;o, again&s;t &s;uch as re&s;i&s;t public Ju&s;tice, or tho&s;e who will not deliver up, but protect, notorious Offenders, and &s;o prevent their receiving condign Puni&s;hment; for, &s;uch Per&s;ons are Enemies to a Country or Nation, and de&s;erve to be treated as &s;uch: And it was for this Rea&s;on that the <HI>other</HI> Tribes in <HI>I&s;rael</HI> made War with <HI>Benjamin,</HI> yea, and they had Warrant from GOD him&s;elf to do &s;o.&mdash;Al&s;o, &s;uch as wickedly rebel again&s;t their lawful Prince, and try to dethrone him, are to be &s;ubdued by Force of Arms: And for this Rea&s;on King <HI>David</HI> made War fir&s;t again&s;t <HI>I&s;hbo&s;heth</HI> and his Party; and afterwards again&s;t his Son <HI>Ab&s;olom</HI> and tho&s;e that adher'd to him.&mdash;And in a Word, this is nece&s;&s;ary, when a Nation cannot otherwi&s;e pre&s;erve or recover its ju&s;t Rights; and more e&s;pecially, when the Enemy is more bold and daring than common, and threatneth &s;peedily to wa&s;te and de&s;troy, and there is Information given of a mighty Ho&s;t either come, or coming forth on that De&s;ign.</P>
<P>BUT without the&s;e, or &s;ome of the&s;e Grounds and Rea&s;ons, the People of GOD may not, as I conceive, take up Arms for War: The Provocation mu&s;t be ju&s;t, and the Call of Providence clear, otherwi&s;e, by making War, People take a ready Cour&s;e to bring Mi&s;chief upon them&s;elves; even as King <HI>Jo&s;iah,</HI> tho' a very good Man, yet was &s;lain in Battle and his Army routed, when he <HI>too ra&s;hly</HI> engaged again&s;t <HI>Pharaoh-necho,</HI> who had neither done, nor de&s;igned him any wrong.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="004788_0015_100DECEC79B5D978">
AND to what has been &s;aid it may be proper to add, That it belongs to the <HI>Heads</HI> and <HI>Rulers</HI> of a People to make and appoint a War: Men in a pri|vate Capacity plainly tran&s;gre&s;s if they pretend to make a War, or knowingly do any Thing which leadeth thereunto, contrary to the Commandment, or without the Knowledge, of their Civil Rulers; That is to &s;ay, unle&s;s tho&s;e Rulers do &s;o <HI>violate their Oath,</HI> as to become a People's <HI>avowed</HI> Enemies, and do very <HI>apparently</HI> join with &s;uch as &s;eek their Ruin: For, altho' I con&s;tantly teach "Submi&s;&s;ion to the King as Supreme, and unto the Governour as unto him that is &s;ent," yet, I &s;ee no Rea&s;on to exhort Peo|ple to pa&s;&s;ive Obedience, and Non-Re&s;i&s;tance, in the <HI>utmo&s;t</HI> Latitude of the &s;ame.</P>
<P>AND now, from what has been &s;aid, we may &s;ee the Mi&s;take of &s;uch, who affirm that <HI>every</HI> kind of War is unlawful: They chiefly urge the <HI>Sixth</HI> Com|mandment for the Proof of their A&s;&s;ertion; but as I conceive, this is not at all to the Purpo&s;e; for doubt|le&s;s, the Intent of that Law is to prevent our killing an <HI>hone&s;t</HI> Man, for his Money's &s;ake, and the like; as al&s;o, our &s;laying a Per&s;on <HI>privately,</HI> becau&s;e of &s;ome Wrong which he has done us, for the Magi&s;trate is GOD's Mini&s;ter to execute Judgment.&mdash;And, in a Word, This Precept was given in order to pre&s;erve and maintain humane Society, by being tender of each other's Lives; but was never under&s;tood by the Church of GOD as enjoining them to &s;pare the Lives of &s;uch, who evidently &s;eek to de&s;troy their Comforts and their Lives too; for indeed, this would be, in effect, to de&s;troy them&s;elves.&mdash;But then, it may not be thought ami&s;s for me to add, That as it cannot be rea&s;onably &s;uppos'd, that a <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> Prince will have Recour&s;e to the Sword until all other Remedies fail; &s;o neither is it con&s;i&s;tent with our <HI>holy Religion,</HI> for People to pro&s;&eacute;ute a War with a Spirit of Malice
<PB N="18" REF="004788_0016_100DECEF85F8E288">
and Hatred, and as tho' we took delight in di&s;patch|ing Souls, unprepar'd for it, into Eternity. Violent Invaders and barbarous Oppre&s;&s;ors may be puni&s;hed, yea, and put to Death too, but then all this &s;hould be without Rancour and Malice in the Hearts of the Conquerors: Nay, we ought &s;o far to love even our open Enemies, as to accept of any rea&s;onable Capitu|lation; yea, and &s;o as (&s;uppo&s;e we are oblig'd to pro|ceed to Battle, then) to pray, that if any fall by our Hands, that GOD would be plea&s;ed to have Mercy on them.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> THE next general Head is, that a Sol|dier's Life is in very great Jeopardy, and e&s;pe|cially in the Field of Battle.</P>
<P>IT is very true indeed, that every Man's Life is expo&s;ed, and that continually; for we have all of us forfeited our very Lives as well as the Comforts of the &s;ame: The Wages of Sin is Death, and it is of the LORD'S Mercies that we are not all con&s;um'd before this Day; even becau&s;e he delighteth not in the Death of Sinners, but waiteth that he may be gracious. Many, <HI>many</HI> Dangers does the mo&s;t High deliver us out of, yea, and doubtle&s;s, many which at pre&s;ent we are not at all &s;en&s;ible of; we ought therefore to look upon our Pre&s;ervation in the World as a Wonder of divine Goodne&s;s, and to give GOD the Prai&s;e of it, and &s;tudy to live to his Glory. Oh! &s;eeing we live from Day to Day on the Fruits of his Bounty, let us live to his Glory, and not give him Rea&s;on &s;till to complain of us, that although "he has nouri&s;hed and brought us up, yet we rebel again&s;t him." Surely it becomes and concerns us all to be humble, con|&s;tant and &s;incere in the Way of Well-doing, and always upon our Watch, as not knowing at what Hour our LORD will come: It is a pre&s;umptuous boa&s;ting of to Morrow, that occa&s;ions Sinners to delay their
<PB N="19" REF="004788_0017_100DECF1A64D0208">
Repentance, until they have neither Heart nor Oppor|tunity for it.</P>
<P>BUT then, all will grant that &s;ome Men's Lives are more expo&s;ed than others, and the&s;e at &s;ome Times more than at others; and a Soldier's Life in particular, and that more e&s;pecially in the Field of Battle. This is a Time when many, <HI>very</HI> many are &s;lain, and one &s;eems to be in hazard as well as ano|ther: The <HI>P&s;almi&s;t,</HI> mo&s;t probably, con&s;ider'd him&s;elf in the Quality of a Soldier, and as a Man of War, when he &s;aid as in P&s;al. 119, 109. <HI>My Soul is conti|nually in mine Hand.</HI> Q. D. There is but a Step be|tween me and Death; and I look upon my Life to be in as great Danger, "as a valuable Trea&s;ure is of being violently taken away, which a Man carries <HI>in his Hand:</HI>" And yet, this Man of GOD did not ex|pire, either in the open Field, or by the Treachery of a di&s;&s;embling Courtier, but in his Bed, and amid&s;t his Friends: But, alas! Who can &s;ay, how many <HI>Thou&s;ands,</HI> and <HI>Ten Thou&s;ands,</HI> have come to their End by the Sword; &s;ome di&s;patch'd in a Moment, and others &s;oon giving up the Gho&s;t by Rea&s;on of their mortal Wounds.</P>
<P>BUT I need not &s;tand upon the Proof of &s;o <HI>evident</HI> a Truth; and therefore &s;hall only add a few u&s;eful <HI>Reflections,</HI> and then proceed. And,</P>
<P N="1">1. THIS teaches us that &s;uch Men are <HI>di&s;tingui&s;hingly</HI> favour'd, who&s;e Lives are pre&s;erv'd in the Day of Battle: They and their Friends with them &s;hould pay a very grateful Acknowledgment to the Pre&s;erver of Men, not only for what Exploit may have been done by their own and other Men's Hands, but al&s;o for that Pre&s;ervation and Deliverance, which they in particular have experienced. Oh! never learn to &s;ay after the Manner of the <HI>Heathen,</HI> <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> It was our good <HI>Fortune</HI> to e&s;cape with our Lives; but extol the
<PB N="20" REF="004788_0018_100DECF3B3CA06B0">
Name of GOD, and &s;hout forth his Prai&s;es, becau&s;e he hath covered your Heads in the Day of Battle. And,</P>
<P N="2">2. HENCE let Soldiers be prevailed with to realize their Danger <HI>before</HI> they go forth to War. You may not imagine, that you are going, at &s;uch a Time, only to take a Walk, or a Voyage; nor that the Ex|pedition will be no other than a plea&s;ant Diver&s;ion; Nay,&mdash;but expect to meet with Hard&s;hips, and con|&s;ider well not only the Fatigue, but al&s;o the Hazard; and be per&s;waded "to &s;et both Hou&s;e and Heart in Order, as not knowing but you may die and not live."&mdash;Yea, and while you are <HI>in</HI> the Service, keep up a lively Sen&s;e of your Danger, and indulge not (like many others) a &s;ecure, heedle&s;s Frame of Spirit; but very often, and in the mo&s;t humble Manner, re&s;ign your Lives into the Hands of your Redeemer; and not your Lives only, but even your very Souls com|mit to him in the Exerci&s;e of Repentance towards GOD, and of Faith in our LORD JESUS CHRIST, earne&s;tly entreating, that they, when-ever call'd for, may &s;ee his Salvation: And in an humble Expecta|tion of the &s;ame, "be of good Courage, and play the Men, for your People and for the Cities of your GOD, and the LORD do that which &s;hall &s;eem good in his Sight."</P>
<P>AND let me go on to &s;ay, Oh! how very de&s;ireable is it, that even <HI>all</HI> &s;uch as go forth to War be <HI>Sober|minded</HI> Per&s;ons?&mdash;Soldiers &s;hould not only labour to be &s;atisfied, that a War be begun and pro&s;ecuted on ju&s;t Grounds, (or at lea&s;t, that the Grounds be not unju&s;t and oppre&s;&s;ive) and then be <HI>willing</HI> to go forth in the Service; but moreover, they ought to be giving all Diligence that they may be <HI>actually</HI> prepar'd for Death.&mdash;Say not, this is to act the Part of <HI>Cowards:</HI> For truly, it is not only the Way to die in Peace,
<PB N="21" REF="004788_0019_100DECF65958BD30">
but moreover, it is the very be&s;t Cour&s;e to become <HI>valiant</HI> in fighting: The good Man, <HI>caeteris paribus,</HI> will certainly make the be&s;t Soldier; &s;o then, all &s;uch as would be good Soldiers let them become good Men; that is, let them repent of their Sins, and make their Peace with GOD, and War again&s;t their Lu&s;ts, becau&s;e the&s;e war again&s;t their Souls; for &s;uch as the&s;e are (as I &s;aid) mo&s;t likely to be truly valiant in Battle. Death, you know, is &s;tyled the King of Terrors; well then, he who can with &s;ome Comfort look Death in the Face, needs not much fear the facing of any other Enemy: The religious <HI>Heroes</HI> who were very famous for Exploits, became (as is ob&s;erv'd in <HI>Heb.</HI> 11.) valorous and victorious <HI>by Faith:</HI> For, "this emboldens Men's Minds by looking unto Things not &s;een, and by deriving Strength from above; yea, and it engages the LORD of Ho&s;ts on their Side."</P>
<P>AND &s;uffer me to add, That as I am fully per|&s;waded, that neither our gracious <HI>Sovereign,</HI> nor his Excellency our <HI>Governour,</HI> will knowingly honour any Man with a Commi&s;&s;ion, who is <HI>noted</HI> among Men for <HI>per&s;i&s;ting</HI> in &s;ome <HI>foul Immorality;</HI> &s;o I &s;hould think, it highly concerns all &s;uch Gentlemen, who &s;hall receive, or have received Commi&s;&s;ions for pro&s;ecuting the War, to &s;ee to it likewi&s;e, that they don't (if po&s;&s;ible to prevent it) admit any of the afore|&s;aid <HI>&s;candalous</HI> Character to &s;erve as Soldiers under them; or, if they be admitted, then to <HI>oblige</HI> them to reform their Manners, "and for this End, it <HI>Lenitives</HI> will not an&s;wer, then to di&s;pen&s;e the <HI>Cor|ro&s;ives</HI> of Martial Di&s;cipline;" and this not only in Pity to &s;uch Men, but al&s;o in Kindne&s;s to the whole Company or Army, le&s;t GOD Almighty be pro|vok'd by Rea&s;on of the Offences of tho&s;e bold Tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ors, and their Commander's Connivance at the &s;ame, to deliver all up to the Will of the Enemy.
<PB N="22" REF="004788_0020_100DECF8B14B08A8">
We find in <HI>Jo&s;h. 7.</HI> That the <HI>Ho&s;t</HI> of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> was put to Flight before the Men of <HI>Ai</HI> becau&s;e of the Tre&s;|pa&s;s of <HI>Achan:</HI> True indeed, his Tre&s;pa&s;s was great, for it was Sacrilege, which is the converting to a private U&s;e, that which is devoted to the Glory of GOD; but then, this Sin of his was <HI>unknown</HI> to <HI>Jo&s;hua,</HI> and mo&s;t probably to the <HI>People</HI> too, and yet they were forced to flee before their Enemies. Is it rea&s;onable then to expect, that &s;uch Commanders &s;hall pro&s;per, who are <HI>fully 'acquainted</HI> with the <HI>foul</HI> Tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ions of the&s;e and tho&s;e private Soldiers, and that they <HI>per&s;i&s;t</HI> therein, and yet admit them to join in Bat|tle again&s;t the Enemy.</P>
<P>PERHAPS you'll &s;ay, if this Doctrine be received, we &s;hall have but <HI>few</HI> Soldiers indeed: To which I <HI>reply,</HI> that if a due Care was taken about this Matter, it would mo&s;t probably promote a Reformation of Manners both in the Army and Navy, and be a Means of Re&s;traint unto many Per&s;ons, and to tho&s;e at lea&s;t who delight in nothing &s;o much as to &s;erve in the Wars: And as for &s;uch who refu&s;e to be re|formed, what great Matter of Service can be expected from them? Will not a <HI>few</HI> Men under the Smiles of Heaven, do far greater Exploits than <HI>ten times</HI> that Number, who (the mo&s;t of them) by their bold Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, are continually bidding <HI>Defiance</HI> to <HI>Heaven</HI> it &s;elf?</P>
<P>AND the Truth is, it becomes and concerns even a <HI>whole Land,</HI> before the Ho&s;t goeth forth to War, to humble them&s;elves, and turn to the LORD, and to implore the Pardon of their Sins, and the divine Pre&s;ence to be vouch&s;afed to their Forces; and other|wi&s;e not to carry them hence. It is worthy of our Ob&s;ervation, "That the Men of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> were defeated in their <HI>fir&s;t</HI> and <HI>&s;econd</HI> Battle with the <HI>Benjamites,</HI> but in the <HI>third</HI> Engagement they obtain'd a compleat Victo|ry; for now at la&s;t, they came up to their Duty
<PB N="23" REF="004788_0021_100DECFB6914B170">
which they had before neglected: Indeed, they had before enquired of the LORD, <HI>Who &s;hall go up fir&s;t?</HI> And then again, <HI>Shall we go up?</HI> But the <HI>Third</HI> Time they <HI>fa&s;ted</HI> and <HI>prayed,</HI> and <HI>implored</HI> the divine Fa|vour, and <HI>then</HI> they had the de&s;ired Succe&s;s." And doubtle&s;s, the People of GOD &s;hould al&s;o, in <HI>the&s;e</HI> Days, &s;eek, and continue to &s;eek, his Face in the Ways of his Appointment, as they would expect his Pre|&s;ence to be with them.&mdash;A People's Cau&s;e may be good, and their Number great, but altho' they have both Right and Strength on their Side, yet the&s;e may not be depended upon, to the Neglect of the Duty of &s;eeking, in the mo&s;t &s;olemn Manner, the Pre&s;ence and Favour of the mo&s;t High. Certainly, we have abundant Rea&s;on to humble our &s;elves before GOD, becau&s;e our Nation and Land, and our &s;elves among others, have provoked Him to &s;tir up a Nation of <HI>&s;o mean a Character,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The <HI>Spaniards.</HI></NOTE> to di&s;turb and impoveri&s;h us at the Rate they do: And O! that our Days of Prayer with Fa&s;ting, may be always duly attended, as know|ing, we have to do with that GOD who will not be mocked, and who hearkens whether Per&s;ons &s;peak aright; that is to &s;ay, whether <HI>each</HI> one for him&s;elf enquireth, &s;aying, <HI>What have I done?</HI> And then breaketh off from Sin, and ca&s;teth away his Tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ions, and returneth unto the LORD. Oh! that there were &s;uch an Heart in us! "Then would GOD quickly &s;ubdue our Enemies, and turn his Hand again&s;t our Adver&s;aries; but our Times would en|dure."</P>
<P>COME we now to the</P>
<P><HI>Fourth</HI> and la&s;t general Head, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> That when a Number of Men do, in a ju&s;t Cau&s;e, and there be Nece&s;&s;ity for it, jeopard their Lives to the Death,
<PB N="24" REF="004788_0022_100DECFD77B2C230">
in Behalf of their Country, it affords Matter of Thank&s;giving unto GOD, and Commendation to &s;uch Men.</P>
<P N="1">1. THIS is Matter of <HI>Commendation</HI> unto &s;uch Men. True indeed, it cannot be a plea&s;ant Exerci&s;e, in it &s;elf con&s;ider'd, to any, but only tho&s;e who are lo&s;t to the common Principles of Humanity, to de|&s;troy their Fellow-Creatures: But yet, for Per&s;ons to engage in Battle with an Eye to the Will and Glory of GOD, and for the Pre&s;ervation of a Town or Country, <HI>this is Prai&s;e-worthy:</HI> They take, as we &s;uppo&s;e, the mo&s;t proper and effectual Method to &s;ecure and defend the Liberties, Properties, and what|&s;oever el&s;e is precious unto a People: And without Doubt, all will readily acknowledge, That when <HI>&s;ome particular Per&s;ons</HI> from among them&s;elves, do <HI>wil|lingly offer</HI> to expo&s;e and jeopard their Lives, for tho&s;e good Ends and Con&s;iderations, they do <HI>worthily</HI> in their Day.&mdash;And as this has a direct Tendency to pre&s;erve a Country from Ruin, and to prolong the Lives and Liberties of the People, &s;o al&s;o to extir|pate the Enemy; or at lea&s;t to &s;ubdue them &s;o far as to bring them to &s;ubmit to proper Terms.</P>
<P>AND if I may be allow'd to make a particular Mention of the <HI>Aboriginal Natives,</HI> who have at one Time and another, from Generation to Generation, even compelled the People of this Land to take up Arms again&s;t them: There is (as I conceive) no Me|thod &s;o likely to &s;ubdue, or to humble them, as <HI>to March forth in Que&s;t of them;</HI> for, by &s;o doing, they are not only prevented coming into our Towns, and &s;laughtering, or captivating the Inhabitants, and ma|king Spoil of their Goods; but moreover, they be|come weary of their u&s;ual Places of Re&s;ort, and find|ing that they can be no where &s;ecure, they are there|fore under a Nece&s;&s;ity to petition for Peace.&mdash;And
<PB N="25" REF="004788_0023_100DECFFAE6B58B8">
we may be &s;ure, that <HI>&s;uch Men</HI> as &s;hall (having pro|per Encouragement) <HI>voluntarily offer them&s;elves</HI> for this Service, if there be again Occa&s;ion for it, (which we pray GOD to forbid!) are mo&s;t likely to trace the Enemy carefully, and fight them valiantly: And the Truth of all this, I think, appears from the In&s;tance of the <HI>brave</HI> LOVEWELL and his <HI>re&s;olute Soldiers,</HI> in the <HI>la&s;t Indian War,</HI> who&s;e Activity and Courage, I doubt not, was what, under Heaven, brought that War to a Period.</P>
<P N="2">2. AND as it is Matter of Commendation to &s;uch Men, &s;o al&s;o, and indeed much more, of <HI>Thank&s;giving</HI> unto <HI>God;</HI> for &s;urely, it is <HI>He</HI> who inclines and &s;pirits them unto this difficult and dangerous Service: Yea, and it looks like a very <HI>&s;ignal Smile</HI> of Providence upon a Land, when a Number of its Inhabitants are &s;o di&s;pos'd: It may be <HI>hoped</HI> that the mo&s;t High has not determin'd &s;peedily to abandon &s;uch a Country, and to give it up to the Will of the Enemy; but that there is Mercy &s;till <HI>in Re&s;erve</HI> for &s;uch a People.</P>
<P>BUT I need not enlarge.&mdash;Only let me add a few Words by Way of <HI>Improvement:</HI> And here,</P>
<P N="1">1. LEARN that &s;uch Men are worthy of Blame, who after they have engaged in this Service do <HI>de&s;ert</HI> and for&s;ake it: Much better it is not to enter upon it, than afterwards to ab&s;cond, and &s;o relinqui&s;h the Service of GOD and their Country.</P>
<P N="2">2. THIS al&s;o teaches us, That it is ju&s;t Matter of <HI>Lamentation,</HI> when &s;uch Men as <HI>offer them&s;elves</HI> to this kind of Service, are either &s;lain in Battle, or taken off in the Camp by &s;ome fatal Malady: They de|&s;erve that Honour from their Country, even that their Fall be lamented: The Lo&s;s thereby &s;u&s;tained is con|&s;iderable, and very ungrateful as well as &s;tupid are
<PB N="26" REF="004788_0024_100DED0142489070">
&s;uch a People, who do not &s;orrowfully re&s;ent it: And I wi&s;h, we may not have many &s;uch Deaths e'er long to mourn over<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Preached <HI>at the Time</HI> of the Expedition to the <HI>Spani&s;h We&s;t-Indies.</HI></NOTE>. And further,</P>

WHAT we have heard may afford <HI>&s;ome</HI> Sati&s;|faction of Mind to tho&s;e among us, who have been, or may be, in this Way, bereaved of de&s;ireable Re|latives: It &s;hould be <HI>&s;ome Allay</HI> to your Grief, to con&s;ider, that the&s;e your departed Friends died in the Service of GOD and their Country, and therefore died honourably, and will be remembred with Re|&s;pect, as their Country's Friends and Benefactors: Yea, and if they were good Chri&s;tians, then the LORD of Ho&s;ts him&s;elf will graciou&s;ly reward their De&s;ires and Endeavours to &s;erve his Cau&s;e, and to advance his Intere&s;t in the World.</P>
<P N="4">4. WHAT we have heard may al&s;o teach us, That it is but ju&s;t and rea&s;onable, that &s;uch as tarry at Home be <HI>helpful,</HI> all the Ways they can, to tho&s;e who go forth to War.&mdash;And more e&s;pecially in the&s;e <HI>two</HI> Ways, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR></P>
<P N="1">(1.) By <HI>Prayer</HI> to GOD on their Behalf. We are obliged by the Bonds both of Nature and Religion to pray one for another; but in a peculiar Manner for tho&s;e of our Friends, who <HI>voluntarily</HI> hazard their Health, their Limbs, and even their very Lives, in the Country's Service: Pray therefore for them, that the LORD would go forth with them, to direct and &s;afe-guard them, and to make them both valorous and victorious: We may not depend on their Conduct and Courage, their Number and Strength; No, No; but &s;eek to engage the LORD of Ho&s;ts on our Side; and if he be for us, who can be again&s;t us? This is
<PB N="27" REF="004788_0025_100DED04C5B6AD50">
a &s;afe, a cheap, and ea&s;y Way of helping them, and even the <HI>Handmaids</HI> of the LORD may in this Re|&s;pect be very helpful in a Time of War. And truly, we &s;hall all be very unkind to our Soldiers, yea, and to our &s;elves too, if we either neglect or trifle in this Exerci&s;e. And,</P>
<P N="2">(2.) WE mu&s;t <HI>reform</HI> our Manners as well as pray for Succe&s;s. See for this, Deut. 23. 9. <HI>When the Ho&s;t goeth forth again&s;t thine Enemies, then keep thee from every wicked Thing:</HI> Not then only, but then without fail: Not &s;ome only, but all the People are hereby enjoined to keep them&s;elves, not from &s;ome only, but from every wicked Thing.&mdash;And it concerns <HI>us all,</HI> at <HI>this</HI> Day, carefully to ob&s;erve it, left GOD be provok'd to give the Victory to our Enemies. A Time of War, we all &s;ay, &s;hould be a Time of Reformation; and truly, we may not other|wi&s;e expect the holy One of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> to hear and an&s;wer our Prayers for Succe&s;s, (1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 7. 3.) Is it not our Wi&s;h, that GOD would be graciou&s;ly pre&s;ent with our Brethren and Neighbours in the <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> War? But now, we do not in a <HI>&s;uitable</HI> Manner de|&s;ire this Thing, and our Prayers are no better than Mockery, unle&s;s we put away Iniquity far from our Tabernacles, and al&s;o endeavour every one to keep him&s;elf from his own Iniquity: Our Sins (<HI>Sirs!</HI>) are our mo&s;t deadly Enemies; the&s;e war again&s;t our own Souls; yea, and they are GOD's Enemies too, and con&s;equently to repent of them, and to return unto the LORD, is the very be&s;t Way to pro&s;per; for, as King <HI>David</HI> acknowledged, "Thine, O LORD, is the Greatne&s;s, and the Power, and the Victory."&mdash;And if there be any other Way wherein we can &s;how Kindne&s;s to &s;uch as are already gone, or that may hereafter go forth in this Service, whether by &s;end|ing a fre&s;h Recruit of Men, or of Provi&s;ions, or by

(2.) GET well arm'd, as al&s;o well in&s;tructed in the Arts of War.&mdash;Be <HI>well arm'd</HI> with In&s;truments proper for the Service: Coun&s;el and Strength for War are not enough without Weapons of War. We find in our Context, Ver&s;e 8. <HI>That there was not Shield or Spear &s;een among Four Thou&s;and in I&s;rael:</HI> And it was doubtle&s;s Policy in their Oppre&s;&s;ors thus to di&s;arm them, well knowing that unarmed Men are quite un|fit for Service, and an ea&s;y Prey to the Enemy: And, let your Armour be Armour of <HI>Proof,</HI> &s;uch as you know to be good by your own Experience; and &s;uch as you are u&s;ed to, and &s;o can the more readily manage it.&mdash;And labour to be <HI>expert</HI> in handling your Weapons; &s;kilful and dexterous, that &s;o you may be able the better to defend your &s;elves, and annoy your Adver&s;aries.&mdash;And I may not omit to advi&s;e you, to get well acquainted with the <HI>Way and Manner</HI> of the Enemy which you are to encounter, and <HI>how</HI> they commonly manage their Battles, whe|ther in the plain and open Field, or el&s;e by lurking in Swamps, and behind the Trees of the Woods, watching for an Opportunity to di&s;charge unexpected|ly upon you; that &s;o your Conduct may be agrea|ble.&mdash;And I &s;hall &s;till further add, That what Nation &s;oever you &s;hall be called forth to oppo&s;e and war again&s;t, you may not imagine that <HI>Stratagems</HI> of War are unlawful. We find in that fore-cited 20th Chap|ter of <HI>Judges,</HI> "That notwith&s;tanding GOD had given to <HI>I&s;rael</HI> an A&s;&s;urance of Succe&s;s, yet, they were not remi&s;s and negligent, nay, but improv'd the be&s;t of their Skill for the effecting of what GOD had promi&s;ed: In the two fir&s;t Engagements they thought it needle&s;s to u&s;e any Art, or to form any Stratagem; but the <HI>third</HI> Time they made U&s;e of &s;ome Policy, for they &s;et Lyers in wait, and laid an Ambu&s;h, and &s;o gain'd the Point, even as their <HI>Fa|thers</HI> had gain'd <HI>Ai,</HI> and that by divine Direction

I be&s;eech you to realize, that there is ab&s;olute Nece&s;&s;ity of the <HI>divine Conduct</HI> to lead and guide an Army, and &s;o al&s;o a Navy, in &s;uch an important Affair; for what is even an <HI>Achitophel</HI> but a Fool, and what is his Coun&s;el but Fooli&s;hne&s;s, when GOD hideth Coun&s;el from him?

And how can you expect any other but the Lo&s;s of <HI>that,</HI> if your Hearts be not right with GOD?

<P>THE <HI>Fir&s;t</HI> is, <HI>The Original De&s;ign of forming the Artillery Company</HI> in this Town; even, that Gentle|men of the be&s;t Fa&s;hion, and of exalted Stations in the Militia, in every Part of the Province, as well as Per&s;ons of a lower Rank, might have the Opportu|nity to become more and more &s;kilful in the U&s;e of

Martial Weapons.&mdash;You are very &s;en&s;ible, I con|clude, from the Appearance which you make this Day, that the happy Time is not yet come, wherein the Nations &s;hall learn War no more; and therefore you judge it to be &s;till needful as well as lawful to know how to u&s;e the Sword and Mu&s;ket, and to un|der&s;tand the whole Art of War in the various Parts of it, which, con&s;idering to whom I &s;peak, I need not go about to enumerate; you will therefore, I tru&s;t, admit of &s;carce any Avocation, but will all, to a Man, con&s;tantly attend and diligently improve your Exerci&s;es at the appointed Sea&s;ons for the &s;ame, and more e&s;pecially in <HI>this</HI> gloomy and dark Day; and that not only as a manly Diver&s;ion, but, on purpo&s;e that you may be &s;till more expert for War, and &s;o the better prepar'd (if there &s;hould be Occa&s;ion for it) either to Face the Enemy your &s;elves, or to furni&s;h the Country with expert Commanders for that End; "Each of them re&s;embling the Son of a King."&mdash;And whereas it is <HI>now</HI> (as you well know) a Time of War, you will therefore the rather make Choice of &s;uch Gentlemen, <HI>this Day,</HI> for your <HI>Officers,</HI> as are mo&s;t capable of leading you, and are mo&s;t likely by their own Example to in&s;pire you with Valour, and whom you have good Rea&s;on to think you can wil|lingly fight under.&mdash;And now, if there was Need to add any Thing by Way of Encouragement to pre|&s;erve a Martial and Warlike Spirit, I &s;hould only put you in Remembrance of what you are not unacquain|ted with; namely, "That Skill and Experience in Arms has in all Ages been the Original of <HI>Nobility;</HI> and that many Per&s;ons, even of mean Extraction, have, by Feats of Arms, ri&s;en to the highe&s;t Honours which their Fellow-Soldiers were capable of conferring upon them."&mdash;But being <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> and many of you, to the Prai&s;e of GOD be it &s;poken, &s;ome of the fir&s;t Rank, therefore a <HI>Go&s;pel</HI> Motive will be more

<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> THE <HI>other</HI> Thing which you will al&s;o bear in Mind, is, <HI>The true De&s;ign of &s;etting up and &s;till upholding the&s;e your Anniver&s;ary religious Solemni|ties;</HI> Namely, that &s;o <HI>your Military Exerci&s;es may be &s;anctified by the Word of GOD and Prayer:</HI> And accordingly you will, doubtle&s;s, heedfully ob&s;erve the good In&s;tructions of the former, and follow our Pray|ers with and for you, with your be&s;t Endeavours, that &s;o you may not, any of you, occa&s;ion any Blemi&s;h to your Profe&s;&s;ion and Character, whether as Soldiers, or as Chri&s;tians; And therefore, will not only improve your Powers in order to excel in Military Skill, but al&s;o be upon your Watch that no corrupt Communi|cation may proceed out of your Mouths; and in&s;tead of approaching to the <HI>lea&s;t Degree</HI> either of <HI>Intempe|rance</HI> or <HI>Extravagancy,</HI> you will labour to be making a <HI>religious</HI> u&s;e of your Military Exerci&s;es, which, in|deed, are capable of being <HI>improved</HI> to very great Advantage in your <HI>Spiritual</HI> Warfare; and by &s;o doing will &s;et a very bright Example before the <HI>Militia</HI> of the <HI>whole Country,</HI> (who&s;e Eyes are much upon you) even of all Chri&s;tian Vertues, as well as of Military Skill and Valour.&mdash;And truly, <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> I can't but hope, that you may be In&s;trumental to re|form the too general Abu&s;e of our <HI>public Trainings;</HI> for, the Officers and Soldiers in our &s;everal Towns cannot, I think, for Shame, do any other but improve &s;uch Days to better Purpo&s;es than of late, when they &s;hall behold your Order, and are given to under&s;tand, that even your whole Conduct both <HI>in</HI> and <HI>out of</HI> the

Al&s;o, <HI>Look</HI> and follow him in the Way of <HI>pa&s;&s;ive</HI> as well as active Obedience; <HI>Eye</HI> his Hand and Coun&s;el under all afflictive Di&s;pen&s;ations,
