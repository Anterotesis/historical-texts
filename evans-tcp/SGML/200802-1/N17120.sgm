<P>THE following POEM is &s;elected from a variety of &s;craps, which were compo&s;ed in the fervour of imagination, as the different &s;ubjects pre&s;ented them|&s;elves to the Author. He has endeavoured, as much as po&s;&s;ible, to arrange them in &s;ome dependence on each other; but a Work of this nature will nece&s;&s;arily be imperfect and irregular. The Author has not the pre|&s;umption to &s;uppo&s;e, that an in&s;ignificant Poem, &s;o en|tirely de&s;titute of incident, can ever be an object of ge|neral regard: To the few, however, who are finely &s;en&s;ible of the beauties of nature, who are plea&s;ed with &s;omething more than the mu&s;ic of poetry, he dedicates his performance; and to tho&s;e only he would recom|mend the peru&s;al of it.</P>
