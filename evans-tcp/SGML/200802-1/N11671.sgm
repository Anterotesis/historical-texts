<P>INASMUCH as this Town is of ancient date, and, compared with mo&s;t of the Towns in this County, even with the Shire-Town it&s;elf, is like an elder Matron amid&s;t a group of youngerly Females; and ina&s;much as it has been famous for Indian inhabi|tants, Indian wars, and Indian barbarities, I have for a con&s;iderable time felt a &s;trong inclination and de&s;ire

to &s;earch into it's hi&s;tory&mdash;to find out it's origin&mdash; the difficulties and hard&s;hips of it's fir&s;t Engli&s;h inha|bitants&mdash;it's gradual increa&s;e and progre&s;&s;ive improve|ments. In &s;hort, I wi&s;hed to be acquainted with whatever was curious, entertaining or in&s;tructive in the circum&s;tances of the town, and the tran&s;actions or &s;ufferings of it's early &s;ettlers. With this view I have &s;earched all the hi&s;tories of the country I could meet with&mdash;enquired for manu&s;cripts that might have pre&s;erved a circum&s;tantial account of &s;ome occurrences which the printed hi&s;tories are wholly &s;ilent <HI>about,</HI> or give but a general &s;ketch <HI>of.</HI> I have con&s;ulted many of the de&s;cendants of the fir&s;t &s;ettlers, and tho&s;e that have been mo&s;t acquainted with the affairs of the town. I have peru&s;ed records, &amp;c. But the re&s;ult of my enquiries does not wholly &s;atisfy my curio&s;ity or an&s;wer my wi&s;h. No intelligence is to be obtained concerning &s;ome things that have happened; and many circum&s;tances relative to divers events that might have been entertaining at this day, have not been handed down by tradition. Our ance&s;tors were under great di&s;advantages as to making exten&s;ive ob&s;ervations, or keeping exact records, or pre&s;erving them for the peru&s;al of po&s;terity. However, I have gleaned a few things relative to the &s;ettling and &s;ub&s;equent improvements of this town, which may &s;erve as a clue to trace the conduct of divine provi|dence&mdash;to point out many in&s;tances of the divine goodne&s;s&mdash;to lead our minds to &s;ome religious reflec|tions&mdash;to excite gratitude in our hearts for the won|derful works which God hath done for us and our fathers&mdash;to encourage our hope and tru&s;t in the &s;ame power and goodne&s;s to protect and ble&s;s us and our po&s;terity&mdash;and to engage us to <HI>keep his commandments.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="014754_0005_0F94DAA1FA3467E8">It was the practice of God's people of old not only to be glad for the great things which He did for them and their country&mdash;to prai&s;e the Lord for his goodne&s;s, and to talk of his doings, but to pre&s;erve memorials, or written accounts of the intere&s;ting events that took place with re&s;pect to their nation&mdash; the mo&s;t remarkable interpo&s;itions of Providence in their favor, and to tran&s;mit them to their children and future generations, for their notice, in&s;truction and excitation to gratitude and a becoming conduct. This is apparent from the words of the P&s;almi&s;t in my text, as well as from many other pa&s;&s;ages in the &s;acred writings. <HI>I will utter dark &s;ayings of old</HI>&mdash;Things wonderful and my&s;terious, performed in ancient times, and in danger of being forgotten, but which ought to be had in everla&s;ting remembrance. <HI>Which we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us.

&s;uch benefits.&mdash;And it has not been unu&s;ual in this country (which was planted, and has &s;ince been pre|&s;erved, protected and pro&s;pered in a manner almo&s;t as a&s;toni&s;hing, and by a power almo&s;t as vi&s;ibly divine, as was that of the children of I&s;rael) it has not been unu&s;ual in this country, at &s;ome remarkable periods, to look back upon pa&s;t events, to rehear&s;e the pa&s;t dealings of God, and to republi&s;h &s;ome pages of hi&s;tory out of the book of Providence, to refre&s;h the minds and entertain and gladden the hearts of tho&s;e that were then on the &s;tage, and al&s;o for the in&s;truc|tion and benefit of tho&s;e that were to come; <HI>that they might not forget the works of God; but might &s;et their hope in God, and keep his commandments.</HI>&mdash;And &s;ince the providence of God has not only been concerned, but his goodne&s;s in a variety of in&s;tances has been vi&s;ible, in the growth and increa&s;e of this Town. amid&s;t the difficulties which the fir&s;t chri&s;tianized planters had to encounter, I thought a Sermon <HI>to bring to remembrance</HI> might be &s;ea&s;onable, entertaining and profitable. Such a Sermon I had propo&s;ed with my&s;elf to have delivered the 2d day of la&s;t Augu&s;t, being the day that ju&s;t compleated a century from the time that <HI>Brookfield</HI> was laid in a&s;hes by the cruel &s;avages of the wilderne&s;s. But the public di&s;tre&s;&s;es and confu&s;ions, that bur&s;t in &s;uch a &s;torm upon this Country la&s;t &s;pring and &s;ummer, prevented my executing my de&s;ign. But not willing it &s;hould prove wholly abortive, I thought it might be acceptable to deliver &s;uch a di&s;|cour&s;e on the la&s;t day of the year&mdash;a day proper for reviewing pa&s;t time, and &s;trengthning our faith, hope and tru&s;t in God, and quickening our obedience, by recollecting the pa&s;t dealings of God with our ance&s;tors and our&s;elves&mdash;and a day rendered remarkable by its

being the anniver&s;ary of that &s;abbath which our pious ance&s;tors, the fir&s;t &s;ettlers of <HI>Plimouth,</HI> fir&s;t ob&s;erved in &s;ocial wor&s;hip in the place of their intended habitation: which being December 31, 1620, is ju&s;t 155 years from this day.</P>
<P>I cannot find exactly at how early a period the fir&s;t <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;ettlements began in this town, nor who the per&s;ons were that began them. A tribe of Indians were the original inhabitants; nor did they move off <HI>before,</HI> or <HI>at</HI> the coming of the white people; but both <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Indians</HI> lived together in friend&s;hip for &s;ome time.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The&s;e Indians were commonly called <HI>Quaboag</HI> Indians. Governor <HI>Hutchin&s;on</HI> in his Hi&s;tory &s;ays, the <HI>Nipnet</HI> or <HI>Nipmuck</HI> Indians ambu&s;h'd the party that went to treat with them at <HI>Meminimi&s;&s;et.</HI> I &s;uppo&s;e it was in con|junction with the Indians of <HI>Quaboag.</HI> For the&s;e, par|taking in the unea&s;ine&s;s and commotion that <HI>Philip</HI> was endeavoring to excite among all the tribes through the country, and growing &s;omewhat &s;hy of their Engli&s;h neigh|bors, and taking offence at &s;ome damages they had &s;u&s;tain|ed from their cattle, they quitted their lands here ju&s;t be|fore the war broke out, and went up to <HI>Meminimi&s;&s;et,</HI> and a&s;&s;i&s;ted in the above mentioned ambu&s;cade and in burn|ing <HI>Brookfield.</HI> After which they returned no more, unle&s;s for mi&s;chief; but &s;cattered among other Indians till they were no more di&s;tingui&s;hed or known.</NOTE> It is certain there were <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> inhabitants here many years before there were any between this place and <HI>Marlborough</HI> on the Ea&s;t, <HI>Con|necticut</HI> River on the We&s;t, and <HI>Canada</HI> on the North.</P>
<P>In the year 1660, i. e. 40 years after the fir&s;t &s;ettlement of <HI>Plimouth,</HI> and upwards of 115 years ago&punc; &s;everal of the inhabitants of <HI>Ip&s;wich</HI> petitioned the Great and General Court for a grant of land in the&s;e
<PB N="10" REF="014754_0008_0F94DAA43995E1E0">
parts. The Court granted them 6 miles &s;quare, or &s;o much land as &s;hould be contained in &s;uch a com|pa&s;s, near <HI>Quaboag</HI> Pond, upon certain conditions <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The an&s;wer to the petition is as follows: "At a great and general court of election held at Bo&s;ton the 20th of May 1660. In an&s;wer to a petition of &s;everal inhabitants of <HI>Ip&s;wich;</HI> this court judgeth it meet to grant the petitioners 6 miles &s;quare, or &s;o much land as &s;hall be contained in &s;uch a compa&s;s, in a place near Quaboag pond, provided they have 20 families there re&s;ident within 3 years, and that they have an able mini&s;ter &s;ettled there within the &s;aid term, &s;uch as this court &s;hall approve; and that they make due provi&s;ion in &s;ome way or other for the future, either by &s;etting apart of lands, or what el&s;e &s;hall be thought meet for the continuance of the mini&s;try among them." I in&s;ert this, principally as a &s;pecimen of the pious principles that actuated our ance&s;tors, and the care which the legi&s;la|tive body took that new &s;ettlements &s;hould have the go&s;pel and the admini&s;tration of the ordinances among them as early, as &s;tatedly and as regularly as po&s;&s;ible. And no doubt it is owing to this care, under providence, that the country flouri&s;hed &s;o greatly both in &s;pirituals and temporals: For it hath been often ob&s;erved that no people was ever the poorer, but on the contrary flouri&s;hed the fa&s;ter for main|taining the go&s;pel mini&s;try among them. And it is un|doubtedly owing to the wi&s;e and pious provi&s;ion of our laws and civil e&s;tabli&s;hment obliging pari&s;hes to &s;ettle and &s;upport evangelical and learned mini&s;ters, that the inhabi|tants of <HI>Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay, Connecticut</HI> and <HI>New-Hamp|&s;hire,</HI> are &s;o much better in&s;tructed in the things of reli|gion, and are &s;o much more remarkable for the &s;trict ob&s;er|vation of the &s;abbath, and for good morals, than tho&s;e of mo&s;t of the other colonies. How prepo&s;terous then is it for any to complain of this as a hard&s;hip and burden! And if any would wi&s;h to alter the civil con&s;titution and laws re&s;pecting this matter, mu&s;t they not be con&s;idered as either ignorantly or wilfully unfriendly both to the civil and reli|gious intere&s;ts of their country?</NOTE> This was the legal origin of the town.

that they might have a <HI>ju&s;t</HI> and <HI>equitable,</HI> as well as a <HI>legal</HI> right to the land&punc; purcha&s;ed it of the Natives, who claimed and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed it, and it was conveyed to them by deed.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">See the Appendix for the deed at large.</NOTE> It is &s;omewhat probable there were &s;ome &s;mall beginnings made here by the Engli&s;h before this grant. But this is not material. It is certain that from &s;mall and early beginnings, the &s;ettlement increa&s;ed, even under the di&s;advantages and di&s;cou|ragements of that day, &s;o that upon application made to the General Court in the year 1673, the inhabitants were incorporated into a Town&s;hip by the name of <HI>Brookfield.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Act of incorporation bears date October 15, 1673.</NOTE> And in the year 1675, when the town was burnt, they had at lea&s;t 20 families, a meeting-hou&s;e, and preaching, though no &s;ettled mini&s;ter.&mdash; The circum&s;tances of it's de&s;olation I &s;hall relate chiefly in the words of the late Governor <HI>Hutchin&s;on,</HI> in his Hi&s;tory of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts Bay. "The Nipnet, or Nipmuck Indians, had killed 4 or 5 people at Mendon in the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts Colony the 14th of July 1675. The Governor and Council, in hopes of reclaiming the Nipnets, &s;ent Captain <HI>Hutchin&s;on</HI> with 20 hor&s;e|men to <HI>Quaboag</HI> (Brookfield) near which place there was to be a great rendezvous of tho&s;e Indians. The Inhabitants of Brookfield had been deluded with the promi&s;e of a treaty at a place agreed upon the 2d of Augu&s;t. Some of the principal of them accompanied Captain <HI>Hutchin&s;on</HI> thither.<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">The place was at the head of <HI>Wickaboug</HI> pond. Some of the company, when they found the Indians were not come according to agreement, &s;u&s;pected treachery and advi&s;ed immediately to return. Others putting too much confidence in their fidelity, urged to proceed, which they accordingly did till they fell into the ambu&s;hment.</NOTE> Not finding the Indians
<PB N="12" REF="014754_0010_0F94DAA5B992A1D8">
there, they rode forward about 4 or 5 miles towards the Nipnets chief town. When they came to a place called Meminimi&s;&s;et, a narrow pa&s;&s;age between a &s;teep hill and a thick &s;wamp, they were ambu&s;hed by 2 or 300 Indians, who &s;hot down 8 of the company, and mortally wounded 3 more, Captain Hutchin&s;on being one of the number. The re&s;t e&s;caped through a by path to Quaboag. The Indians flocked into the town; but the inhabitants being alarmed, had all gathered together in the principal hou&s;e. They had the mortification to &s;ee all their dwelling-hou&s;es, about 20, with all their barns and out-hou&s;es burnt. The hou&s;e where they had a&s;&s;embled was then &s;urrounded, and a variety of attempts were made to &s;et fire to it. At length the Indians filled a cart with hemp and other combu&s;tible matter, which they kindled; and whil&s;t they were thru&s;ting it towards the hou&s;e, a violent &s;hower of rain fell &s;uddenly and extingui&s;hed the fire. [This is according to Mr. Hubbard. Mr. Mather takes no notice of the rain, but &s;ays Willard came upon the Indians and prevented the execution." This latter account is neare&s;t the truth.] "Augu&s;t 4th Major Willard, who had been &s;ent after &s;ome other Indians we&s;tward, heard of the di&s;tre&s;s of Brookfield when he was about 4 or 5 miles from Lanca&s;ter, which cau&s;ed him to alter his cour&s;e; and the &s;ame night he reached Brookfield, after 30 miles march. And though the Indian &s;couts di&s;covered him and fired their alarm guns, yet the main body, from their high joy, always accompanied with a horrid noi&s;e, heard them not. Willard joined the be&s;ieged, and the Indians immediately poured in all the &s;hot they could, but without execution, and then quitted the &s;iege, and de&s;troyed all the hor&s;es and cattle they
<PB N="13" REF="014754_0011_0F94DAA679ECA8B8">
could find, and then withdrew to their dens. They were not pur&s;ued, being much &s;uperior in number."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>It may not be ami&s;s to add to the above account the fol|lowing particulars, viz. That three of the men who were killed in the ambu&s;hment belonged to <HI>Brookfield,</HI> viz. Captain <HI>John Ayres, John Coye</HI> and <HI>Jo&s;eph Pritchard:</HI>&mdash; That when the Indians pur&s;ued the party into the town, they &s;et fire to all the buildings except a few in the neighborhood of the hou&s;e in which the inhabitants had taken &s;helter:&mdash;That they endeavored to intercept 5 or 6 men that had gone to a neighboring hou&s;e to &s;ecure &s;ome things there; but they all got &s;afe to the place of refuge, except a young man, <HI>Samuel Pritchard</HI> who was &s;topped &s;hort by a fatal bullet:&mdash;That the hou&s;e in which they were be&s;ieged was unfortified, except by a few logs ha&s;tily tumbled up on the out&s;ide after the alarm, and by a few feather beds hung up on the in&s;ide. And though the &s;iege continued &s;everal days, in which time innumerable balls entered the hou&s;e, only one man, <HI>Henry Young,</HI> who was in the chamber, was killed.&mdash;The Indians &s;hot many fire|arrows to burn the hou&s;e; but without effect. And on one night the be&s;ieged were &s;urprized by a &s;udden light without doors, and &s;oon perceived that the Indians had placed a quantity of combu&s;tibles by the &s;ide of the hou&s;e and &s;et them on fire. And tho' the people were obliged to go out and draw water to extingui&s;h the flames, and were all the while expo&s;ed as marks to the enemy's bullets, yet they &s;aved the hou&s;e without any one's being hurt.&mdash; During the &s;iege one man was wounded as he was drawing water. A board fence hid him from the Indians: but one of them &s;eeing the well-pole drawing down, took aim at the place where he thought the man mu&s;t &s;tand, and &s;truck him ju&s;t under the chin. The man affrighted, bawl'd out that he was kill'd. The Indian, knowing his voice, &s;houted and &s;aid, "Me kill Major <HI>Wil&s;on.</HI>"&mdash;When the troop which relieved <HI>Brookfield</HI> got into the town, which was late at night, they were joined by great numbers of cattle, that had collected together in their fright at the conflagra|tion of the buildings, and the firing and war-whoops of the Indians; and for protection the&s;e poor animals followed the troop till they arrived at the be&s;ieged hou&s;e. The Indians deceived hereby, and thinking there was a much larger number of hor&s;emen than there really was, immedi|ately &s;et fire to the barn belonging to the be&s;ieged hou&s;e, and to <HI>Jo&s;eph Pritchard</HI>'s hou&s;e and barn and the meeting-hou&s;e, which were the only buildings left unburnt, and went off. A garri&s;on was maintained at this hou&s;e till winter, when the court ordered the people away, &s;oon after which the Indians came and burnt this hou&s;e al&s;o.</P>
<P>Long as this note is, I cannot conclude without &s;aying &s;ome|thing concerning Major <HI>Willard,</HI> the celebrated deliverer of the people here. His conduct in altering his cour&s;e and coming to the relief of <HI>Brookfield,</HI> being dictated by humanity and executed with bravery and &s;ucce&s;s, has gained him the applau&s;e of people in general. But as it was be&s;ide his orders, he was cen&s;ured by the Court and ca&s;hiered, which di&s;gu&s;ted his friends and broke his heart. And though the puni&s;hment may &s;eem too rigorous, yet it ought to be remembered, that if commanders of parties, &s;ent upon particular expeditions, may take liberty to vary from their expre&s;s orders, nothing effectual could be accompli&s;hed, and only confu&s;ion, di&s;appointment, lo&s;s, and in many ca&s;es ruin would be likely to en&s;ue.</P></NOTE></P>

<P>For the information of tho&s;e who may wi&s;h to know, I would &s;ay &s;omething concerning the con&s;titution of this Town. Though the inhabitants were incorporated and the town named by the court as early as the year 1673, yet they were not allowed the powers and authorities of a town till the year 1718: But the court appointed and continued a committee con&s;i&s;ting of gentlemen belonging to other places, to direct, regulate and ratify all affairs relative to &s;ettling and building up the town. So that without &s;aid committee the inhabitants could not take up for them&s;elves, or grant to others, any lands.

A party of Indians came into the town and broke up two or three families. <HI>Jo&s;eph Woolcot</HI> being at work a little di&s;tance from his hou&s;e, his wife being fearful took her children and went out to him. When they returned to the hou&s;e at noon they found the Indians had been there, for his gun and &s;everal other things were mi&s;&s;ing.

He immediately &s;ent out his wife and his two little daughters to hide them&s;elves in the bu&s;hes; and he taking his little &s;on under his arm and his broad ax in his hand, went out with his dog in &s;ight of the Indian. The dog being large and fierce, attacked the Indian &s;o furiou&s;ly, that he was obliged to di&s;charge his gun at the dog to rid him&s;elf of him: immediately upon which <HI>Woolcot</HI> &s;at down the child and pur&s;ued the Indian till he heard the bullet roll down his gun (the Indian charging as he ran) he then turn'd back, &s;natch'd up his child and made his e&s;cape through the &s;wamps to a fort. His wife being greatly terrified, di&s;covered by her &s;hricks where &s;he was; and the Indian &s;oon found and di&s;patched both her and her children. Others of the party about the &s;ame time came into the hou&s;e of one <HI>Ma&s;en,</HI> while the family were at dinner. They killed <HI>Ma&s;on</HI> and one or two children, and took his wife and an infant which they had wounded, and carried them off. They al&s;o took two brothers, <HI>Thomas</HI> and <HI>Daniel Lawrence:</HI> they &s;oon di&s;patched <HI>Thomas,</HI> pre|tending he had mi&s;informed them about the number of men that were in the town. <HI>John Lawrence,</HI> their brother, rode with all ha&s;te to <HI>Springfield</HI> for a&s;&s;i&s;tance. A com|pany under the command of Captain <HI>Coulton</HI> came with the greate&s;t &s;peed and pur&s;ued the Indians. They found Mrs. <HI>Ma&s;on</HI>'s child, which the Savages had knock'd on the head and thrown away in the bu&s;hes; and continuing their pur&s;uit, they came upon the Indians encampment, which was a &s;ort of bru&s;h hedge, which they deridingly called "<HI>Engli&s;hmen</HI>'s fort." The party waited till break of day, and then came &s;o near as to put their guns through this bru&s;h and fire upon the Indians, 14 or 15 of whom were killed, the re&s;t fled with &s;uch precipitation as to leave &s;everal of their arms, blankets, powder-horns, &amp;c. and their pri&s;oners, <HI>Daniel Lawrence</HI> and Mrs. <HI>Ma&s;on,</HI> whom our men conducted back.&mdash;This &s;ame <HI>John Lawrence,</HI> who rode expre&s;s and procured the company that re&s;cued the above mentioned pri&s;oners, was afterwards going in com|pany with one <HI>Samuel Owen</HI> in &s;earch of a man that was mi&s;&s;ing: the Indians came upon them, killed <HI>Lawrence,</HI> but <HI>Owen</HI> e&s;caped.&mdash;<HI>Mary McInto&s;h</HI> was &s;ired upon and killed as &s;he was milking her cows.&mdash;<HI>Robert Grainger</HI> and <HI>John Clary</HI> were pa&s;&s;ing along the road on a certain day and being fired upon by the Savages, <HI>Grainger</HI> was killed on the &s;pot; <HI>Clary</HI> attempted to e&s;cape, but had not fled far before he al&s;o was &s;hot down.&mdash;At another time <HI>Thomas Battis</HI> of <HI>Brookfield</HI> riding expre&s;s to <HI>Hadley,</HI> was killed in the wilderne&s;s, in a place now called <HI>Belcher-Town.</HI>&mdash; Early one morning <HI>John Woolcot,</HI> a lad about 12 or 14 years old, was riding in &s;earch of the cows, when the In|dians fired at him, killed his hor&s;e under him and took him pri&s;oner. The people at <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"></HI>'s garri&s;on hearing the firing, and concluding the people at another garri&s;on were be&s;et, &s;ix men &s;et out for their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, but were way-laid by the Indians. The Engli&s;h &s;aw not their danger till they &s;aw there was no e&s;caping it. And therefore, knowing that an Indian could not look an Engli&s;hman in the face and take a right aim, they &s;tood their ground, pre|&s;enting their pieces wherever they &s;aw an Indian without di&s;charging them, excepting <HI>Abijah Bartlet,</HI> who turned to flee and was &s;hot dead. The Indians kept firing at the re&s;t, and wounded three of them, <HI>Jo&s;eph Jennings</HI> in two places; one ball grazed the top of his head, by which he was &s;truck blind for a moment; another ball pa&s;&s;ed thro' his &s;houlder, wounding his collar bone; yet by neither did he fall, nor was mortally wounded. <HI>Benjamin Jennings</HI> was wounded in the leg, and <HI>John Green</HI> in the wri&s;t. They were pre&s;erved at la&s;t by the following &s;tratagem. A large dog hearing the firing came to our men; one of whom, to encourage his brethren and intimidate the Indians, called out "Captain <HI>Williams</HI> is come to our a&s;&s;i&s;tance, for here is his dog." The Indians &s;eeing the dog, and know|ing <HI>Williams</HI> to be a famous warrior immediately fled, and our men e&s;caped. <HI>John Woolcot,</HI> the lad above-mentioned, was carried to <HI>Canada,</HI> where he remained &s;ix or &s;even years, during which time, by conver&s;ing wholly with Indians, he not only entirely lo&s;t his native language, but became &s;o naturalized to the &s;avages, as to be unwil|ling for a while to return to his native country. Some years afterwards, viz. in March 172<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">, in a time of peace, he and another man having been hunting, and coming down <HI>Connecticut</HI> river with a freight of &s;kins and furr, they were hail'd by &s;ome Indians; but not being willing to go to them, they &s;teered for another &s;hore. The Indians landed at a little di&s;tance from them; &s;everal &s;hots were exchanged, at length <HI>Woolcot</HI> was killed.</P>
<P>The la&s;t mi&s;chief which was done by the Savages in <HI>Brookfield</HI> was about the 20th of July 1710. Six men, viz. <HI>Ebenezer Hayward, John White, Stephen</HI> and <HI>Benjamin Jennings, John Gro&s;venor,</HI> and <HI>Jo&s;eph Kellog</HI> were making hay in the meadows, when the Indians, who had been watching an opportunity to &s;urprize them, &s;prung &s;uddenly upon them, di&s;patched five of them, and took the other <HI>(John White)</HI> pri&s;oner. <HI>White</HI> &s;pying a &s;mall company of our people at &s;ome di&s;tance, jump'd from the Indian that held him and ran to join his friends; but the Indian fired after him, and wounded him in the thigh, by which he fell; but &s;oon recovering and running again, he was again fired at and received his death wound.</P></NOTE></P>

<P>But my bu&s;ine&s;s at this time is not &s;o much with the country in general, having in the forenoon con|&s;idered it's growth and increa&s;e through formidable difficulties and di&s;couragements. Let us confine our view to our own town: And we need not go back 60 years to find the beginning of it's church-&s;tate. Sixty years ago there was no meeting-hou&s;e, nor &s;ettled mini&s;ter in the town. And when the inha|bitants had built a hou&s;e for the wor&s;hip of God, they had no occa&s;ion for galleries for the people to

fit in, though the hou&s;e was not large. But now, not to reckon a great part of <HI>We&s;tern,</HI> which was then <HI>Brookfield,</HI> but was &s;et off about 35 years ago, nor a con&s;iderable number of families which joined with others to form the di&s;trict of <HI>New-Braintree,</HI> about 25 years ago, there are within this town three di&s;tinct pari&s;hes, the lea&s;t of which contains upwards of 100 families&mdash;three commodious well-fini&s;hed meeting-hou&s;es&mdash;three regular congregational churches&mdash;and in the whole town at lea&s;t 3000 &s;ouls.&mdash;It would have been plea&s;ing to a curious mind to have known the exact number of births, deaths, bapti&s;ms and admi&s;&s;ions to full communion, &s;ince the commencement of the town: But this I find impo&s;&s;ible to a&s;certain; becau&s;e records of the&s;e things have not been pre|&s;erved. The birth of earlie&s;t date that I find upon record is in the year 1701.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Mary Bartlet,</HI> daughter to <HI>Benjamin</HI> and <HI>Mary Bartlet,</HI> born May 6, 1701.</NOTE> As to deaths, even &s;ince a book was kept, many people have been, and are &s;till, negligent in tran&s;mitting an account of them to the town-clerk. And as to church records, I cannot find that any were kept in Mr. <HI>Cheney</HI>'s or Mr. <HI>Harding</HI>'s day. During the Rev. Mr. <HI>Par&s;ons</HI>'s mini&s;try 203 were baptized in the fir&s;t church; and &s;ince the Rev. Mr. <HI>Ward</HI>'s ordination 87, in all 290. In the &s;econd church &s;ince it's incorporation I find the record of 426 bapti&s;ms. Since my &s;ettlement 366 have been baptized in this church; 98 admitted to full communion which added to the 39 which were fir&s;t embodied, make 137: 19 of which are dead, and 15 di&s;mi&s;&s;ed to other churches. So that there are now 103 members of this third church.&mdash;Of this town therefore, as well as of the country in general,

Or has any other nation of a fierce counte|nance, a hard language and harder hearts, invaded our territories?

What have we done to merit &s;uch treatment? What high-handed crimes have we been guilty of to awaken &s;uch vengeance? Many crimes have we been guilty of again&s;t heaven; but none, adequate to &s;uch puni&s;hment, again&s;t the nation that executes &s;uch vengeance upon us.

We think we have re&s;i&s;ted no authority but &s;uch as natural and con&s;titutional right warrants us to re&s;i&s;t. We have never lifted up a hand but in our own de&s;ence, to ward off the blow that was aimed at our heads, or to return the blow after it had bee&punc; fir&s;t given.&mdash;But I forbear.&mdash;We have appealed to Heaven for the ju&s;tice of our cau&s;e; and <HI>GOD,</HI> the God of ju&s;tice, <HI>&s;itteth on the throne judging right.</HI> And it would be great ingratitude in us not to acknow|ledge the &s;ignal hand of providence in uniting, directing and &s;ucceeding us in &s;o remarkable a manner the &s;ummer pa&s;t&mdash;in di&s;appointing and re&s;training our enemies, and in &s;ome parts, viz. <HI>Ticonderoga, St. Johns, Chamblee,</HI> and <HI>Montreal,</HI> entirely &s;ubduing them.
