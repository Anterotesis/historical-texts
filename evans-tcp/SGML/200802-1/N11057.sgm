<P>THE in&s;pired Author of this excellent Ad|monition was &s;o &s;en&s;ible of the invaluable

ble&s;&s;ings and comforts that re&s;ulted from that free &s;pirit, with which JESUS CHRIST through his Mini&s;try, had e&s;tabli&s;hed his Galatian Con|verts, that he was jealous of the lea&s;t attempt to de&s;troy or even ob&s;truct in them its life-giving operation. He could not brook the narrow &s;pirit of tho&s;e Judaizing Chri&s;tians, who, from the mo&s;t &s;elfi&s;h and illiberal motives, &s;ought to force a yoke upon the necks of their Gentile Brethren, which neither they them&s;elves nor their Fathers had been able to bear. The&s;e Gentiles too he &s;everely reproves for not maintaining their ground, and a&s;&s;erting their Go&s;pel Freedom again&s;t the in&s;idious devices of their Brethren, who only wanted to bring them into &s;ervitude, "THAT THEY MIGHT GLORY IN THEIR FLESH."&mdash;"O FOOLISH GA|LATIANS! WHO HATH BEWITCHED YOU?" He a&s;cribes their blindne&s;s and infatuation to &s;ome diabolical charm, which had locked up the powers of their free-born &s;pirits, and made them tamely &s;ubmit to &s;lavi&s;h, carnal ordinan|ces, which the Go&s;pel of JESUS had entirely exploded and aboli&s;hed. He reminds them, by a &s;pirited explication of a mo&s;t &s;triking allegory, that they were not "CHILDREN OF
<PB N="4" REF="014013_0010_0F928739A658CD90">
THE BOND-WOMAN, BUT OF THE FREE;" that their ob&s;ervance of the ceremonial law was a tribute, which they were not bound to pay; or, if they &s;hould be &s;o weak as to &s;ubmit to it, that it could not emancipate them from the bondage of earth and hell; but that their real freedom, their full and compleat ju&s;tification, their happine&s;s temporal and eternal were only to be acquired by a vigorous exertion of tho&s;e &s;piritual powers within them&s;elves, which, through the riches of GOD'S free grace in CHRIST JESUS, had been communicated to their &s;ouls. He concludes this part of his ad|dre&s;s with the truly noble and apo&s;tolical pre|cept of my text: STAND FAST, THEREFORE, IN THE LIBERTY, WHEREWITH CHRIST HATH MADE US FREE.</P>
<P>HAVING thus briefly opened the occa&s;ion and meaning of the words, I &s;hall proceed to &s;hew, in the fir&s;t place, what we are to under&s;tand by that SPIRITUAL LIBERTY, "WHEREWITH CHRIST HATH MADE US FREE," and what kind of conduct that mu&s;t be, which is here expre&s;&s;ed by the words "STAND FAST."</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="014013_0011_0F928739EC7A2390">
I. HOWEVER &s;evere, my dear Brethren, the lo&s;s of our temporal Liberties may be, there is certainly a Bondage far more &s;evere than this, yea, far more cruel, than that of ISRAEL under their EGYPTIAN Ta&s;k-ma&s;ters. A Bondage, not only to men, but to the fallen &s;pirits of darkne&s;s, &s;eeking to exerci&s;e over us a joint power and dominion with our own irregular and corrupt pa&s;&s;ions. A Bondage univer&s;al, from which no Son of Adam hath ever been exempt; a tyranny, who&s;e baleful influences have been felt from the fall of man down to this very day. It has &s;eized not only upon the body, but upon the &s;oul. It has erected its throne in the heart, and from thence impo&s;es its arbitrary decrees. It is confined to no age or &s;ex, no &s;tate or condi|tion of human life. High and low, learned and unlearned, the &s;avage and the &s;age, are alike the victims of this de&s;potic power, alike &s;laves by nature under this bondage of cor|ruption.</P>
<P>IT is perpetually manife&s;ting it&s;elf under a variety of forms, according to our prevailing de&s;ires and pur&s;uits. It follows us into the
<PB N="6" REF="014013_0012_0F92873C4DA0EC10">
Sanctuary of God. It &s;teals into our private devotions. It gives a phari&s;aical tincture to our be&s;t good works. It reigns as a ma&s;ter and ab&s;olute Sovereign in the wicked and unregenerate. Yea, it frequently enters the mo&s;t &s;piritual and regenerate hearts in ho&s;tile form, and &s;eeks to &s;hake their confidence in the goodne&s;s of their true and rightful Sove|reign, and their humble hope of deliverance through the redeeming power of his ever-ble&s;&s;ed Son.</P>
<P>NOW, who would not wi&s;h to be delivered from &s;uch a bondage as this? And yet, my brethren, &s;uch a wi&s;h cannot be formed, 'till, by divine grace, the free-born powers of the &s;oul are brought to be &s;en&s;ible of their bur|den, and to groan beneath the weight of op|pre&s;&s;ion. "THE WHOLE (or they that think them&s;elves whole) NEED NOT A PHY|SICIAN, BUT THEY THAT ARE SICK." The madman hugs his chains, as if they were en|&s;igns of royalty. In&s;en&s;ible of his calamity, he cannot even wi&s;h for relief.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="014013_0013_0F92873D9A9217F0">
BUT no &s;ooner does the child of grace, the offspring of Heaven come to feel the bondage of the infernal u&s;urper; no &s;ooner does he find him&s;elf harra&s;&s;ed and oppre&s;&s;ed by the obedience which he exacts to his un|righteous laws; no &s;ooner is he convinced, that &s;uch an obedience mu&s;t terminate in ever-la&s;ting &s;lavery and wretchedne&s;s, than he awakens from his &s;leep of &s;ecurity, and turns to and avails him&s;elf of that light, and &s;trength, and &s;piritual courage and con&s;tancy, which his Redeemer is ever at hand to im|part, and without which he feels him&s;elf ab&s;o|lutely unequal to the conflict, and incapable of extricating him&s;elf from the ignoble &s;ervi|tude.</P>
<P>FROM hence then it appears, that the LI|BERTY, WITH WHICH CHRIST HATH MADE US FREE, is nothing le&s;s than &s;uch a relea&s;e from the arbitrary power of &s;in, &s;uch an en|largement of the &s;oul by the efficacy of divine grace, and &s;uch a total &s;urrender of the will and affections, to the influence and guidance of the divine Spirit, ("FOR WE ARE MADE A WILLING PEOPLE IN THE DAY OF GOD'S
<PB N="8" REF="014013_0014_0F92873DCEB749C8">
POWER") as will enable us to live in the habi|tual chearful practice of every grace and virtue here, and qualify us for the free, full and un|interrupted enjoyment of heavenly life and Liberty hereafter.</P>
<P>THESE glorious privileges being once ob|tained, the &s;inner being once ju&s;tified, and adopted into the family of God, and having received the &s;eal of his heavenly citizen&s;hip, the conduct recommended to him in my text as the mo&s;t effectual for the pre&s;ervation of the&s;e privileges, is here expre&s;&s;ed by the words "STAND FAST:" that is to &s;ay:</P>
<P>"MAINTAIN, firm and un&s;haken, the ground which CHRIST hath given you. Be ever vigilant and prepared again&s;t the open or in&s;idious attacks of your adver&s;ary."</P>
<P>HE is not commanded to march upon the Devil's ground, to &s;eek out the temper or the temptation, in order to make a trial of his &s;trength, or merely that he may have the ho|nour of a victory: But only to "STAND FAST," to act upon the defen&s;ive, and, arm|ed at all points with a cele&s;tial panoply, to be ready to re&s;i&s;t and repel the mo&s;t daring
<PB N="9" REF="014013_0015_0F92873E76EFF318">
attempts of his perfidious foe: As well know|ing, that if he &s;uffers him&s;elf to be taken cap|tive, &s;lavery and woe mu&s;t be his everla&s;ting portion; but, if he comes off conqueror from the conflict, that the life, liberty and joys of Heaven will be his everla&s;ting reward.</P>
<P>THUS far have I travelled in a well known path, and &s;poken a language familiar to mo&s;t of you, and which you have long been ac|cu&s;tomed to hear from this Pulpit.</P>
<P>II. I AM now to &s;trike into another path, which, though it may not always terminate in &s;uch glorious &s;cenes of never-ending felicity as the former, yet, if &s;tedfa&s;tly pur&s;ued, will conduct the &s;ons of men to an happine&s;s, of an inferior kind indeed, but highly nece&s;&s;ary to their pre&s;ent temporary &s;tate of exi&s;tence in this world.</P>
<P>IF SPIRITUAL LIBERTY calls upon its pi|ous Votaries to extend their views far forward to a glorious HEREAFTER, CIVIL LIBERTY mu&s;t at lea&s;t be allowed to &s;ecure, in a con&s;i|derable degree, our well-being HERE. And I believe it will be no difficult matter to
<PB N="10" REF="014013_0016_0F92873F347D31E0">
prove, that the latter is as much the gift of GOD in CHRIST JESUS as the former, and con&s;equently, that we are bound to &s;tand fa&s;t in our CIVIL as well as our SPIRITUAL FREEDOM.</P>
<P>FROM what hath been &s;aid under my fir&s;t head of di&s;cour&s;e, I think it mu&s;t appear, that LIBERTY, traced to her true &s;ource, is of heavenly extraction, that divine Virtue is her illu&s;trious parent, that from eternity to eternity they have been and mu&s;t be in&s;epa|rable companions, and that the hearts of all intelligent beings are the living temples, in which they ought to be jointly wor&s;hipped.</P>
<P>We have the authority of divine Revela|tion to a&s;&s;ert, that this globe of earth was once the favoured &s;pot, on which &s;he was &s;ent to re&s;ide, and that the fir&s;t man felt and enjoy|ed her divine influence within and around him. But the &s;ame Revelation tells us, what our own experience cannot but confirm, that when man lo&s;t his virtue, he lo&s;t his Liberty too; and from that fatal period, became &s;ub|ject to the bondage of corruption, the &s;lave
<PB N="11" REF="014013_0017_0F92874127E608F8">
of irregular pa&s;&s;ions, at war with him&s;elf and his own &s;pecies, an alien from his native country, a &s;orrowful &s;tranger and a weary pilgrim in this world of woe.</P>
<P>IT was not only to put him into a capacity of regaining his forfeited heavenly bli&s;s, but to mitigate, likewi&s;e, the &s;orrows of his earth|ly &s;ojourn, that the EVERLASTING JESUS, in and by whom GOD originally created man, vouch&s;afed to communicate to him, when fallen, a ray of hope, a &s;park of hea|venly light, wi&s;dom, power and goodne&s;s, by which, through the effectual workings of his grace, he might, in future time, in&s;pire him and his haple&s;s po&s;terity with &s;uch prin|ciples as would lead them to know, contend for and enjoy Liberty in its large&s;t, noble&s;t extent.</P>
<P>WHATE'ER of order, truth, equity and good government is to be found among the &s;ons of men, they are &s;olely indebted for to this EVERLASTING COUNSELLOR, this PRINCE OF PEACE. By nature &s;urrounded with innumerable wants, which his own &s;in|gle una&s;&s;i&s;ted hand could by no means &s;up|ply,
<PB N="12" REF="014013_0018_0F9287416D79B558">
expo&s;ed to innumerable dangers, which his utmo&s;t &s;trength and &s;harpe&s;t fore&s;ight could not po&s;&s;ibly ward off, it mu&s;t &s;urely have been this WISDOM OF THE FATHER, that fir&s;t taught man, by SOCIAL COMPACT, to &s;ecure to him&s;elf the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e nece&s;|&s;aries and comforts, which are &s;o dear and valuable to his natural life. And though no particular mode of government is pointed out to us in his holy go&s;pel, yet the benevo|lent &s;pirit of that go&s;pel is directly oppo&s;ed to every other form, than &s;uch as has the COM|MON GOOD of mankind for its end and aim.</P>
<P>NOW this COMMON GOOD is matter of COMMON FEELING. And hence it is, that our be&s;t writers, moral and political, as well Clergy as Laity, have a&s;&s;erted, that true go|vernment can have no other foundation than COMMON CONSENT. 'Tis the power, the wi&s;dom, the maje&s;ty of the people committed to ONE, to a FEW, or to MANY&mdash;yea, in &s;ome hitherto favoured &s;tates, the ONE, the FEW, and the MANY, have been entru&s;ted together, that they might mutually controul and be controuled by each other.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="014013_0019_0F92874255333730">
INASMUCH, therefore, as this &s;olemn De|legation was intended for the good of the whole; ina&s;much as all Rulers are in fact the Servants of the Public, and appointed for no other purpo&s;e than to be "A TERROR TO EVIL-DOERS, AND A PRAISE TO THEM THAT DO WELL; whenever this divine or|der is inverted, whenever the&s;e Rulers abu&s;e their &s;acred tru&s;t, by unrighteous attempts to injure, oppre&s;s, and en&s;lave tho&s;e very per&s;ons, from whom alone, under GOD, their power is derived&mdash;does not humanity, does not rea&s;on, does not &s;cripture call upon the Man, the Citizen, the Chri&s;tian of &s;uch a community to "STAND FAST IN THAT LIBERTY WHEREWITH CHRIST (in their very birth, as well as by &s;ucceeding appoint|ments of his Providence) HATH MADE THEM FREE?"</P>
<P>THE Apo&s;tle enjoins us to "SUBMIT TO EVERY ORDINANCE OF MAN FOR THE LORD'S SAKE." But &s;urely a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the unrighteous ordinances of unrighteous men, cannot be "FOR THE LORD'S SAKE: For "HE LOVETH RIGHTEOUSNESS, AND

<P>POSSESSED, therefore, of the&s;e principles&mdash;Principles, upon which the pre&s;ent con&s;ti|tution of BRITAIN was happily &s;ettled at one of her mo&s;t glorious and memorable aeras, and upon which alone it can &s;till be &s;upport|ed&mdash;Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the&s;e principles. I tru&s;t it will be no difficult matter to &s;atisfy your con|&s;ciences with re&s;pect to the righteou&s;ne&s;s of the cau&s;e, in which you are now engaged.</P>
<P>THE &s;truggle, 'tis true, is an unnatural one. The hard nece&s;&s;ity of &s;tanding upon our defence again&s;t our brethren, children of the &s;ame family, educated in the &s;ame man|ners, the &s;ame religion with our&s;elves, bound together by a long reciprocation of endearing offices, by a long participation of common ble&s;&s;ings, and of common dangers and di&s;|tre&s;&s;es, mutually protecting and protected by each other.&mdash;The hard nece&s;&s;ity, I &s;ay, of defending our&s;elves, our ju&s;t and undoubt|ed rights again&s;t &s;uch unnatural adver&s;aries, (though &s;adly to be lamented, as one of the heavie&s;t judgments with which Heaven could

<P>WE venerate the Parent Land from whence our progenitors came. We wi&s;h to look up to her as the GUARDIAN, not the INVADER of her children's rights. We glo|ry in the name of children.

<P>BUT, if we are to judge from the late ungenerous and ill-dige&s;ted plans of policy, which have been adopted by tho&s;e whom &s;he hath entru&s;ted with the powers of Admini|&s;tration, we cannot but think, that they be|gan to be jealous of our ri&s;ing glory, and, from an ill-grounded apprehen&s;ion of our aiming at independency, were de&s;irous of checking our growth.</P>

<P>IN an&s;wer to this objection it may be a&s;ked&mdash;Where did this infamous commerce originate? And where is it &s;till carried on with all the eagerne&s;s which avarice can in&s;pire? Where, but in England?&mdash;By what means can it be aboli&s;hed? Surely by that power alone, which America acknowledges the pa|rent &s;tate may ju&s;tly exerci&s;e over all her dominions, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> the power of regulating their trade?&mdash;</P>
<P>Is it not well known, that the legi&s;latures of &s;ome of the colonies have done what they could to put a &s;top to the importation of African &s;laves, by loading it with the heavie&s;t duties? And that others have at|tempted the total abolition of it, by acts of a&s;&s;embly, which their Governor refu&s;ed to pa&s;s, have then pe|titioned the parent &s;tate for new in&s;tructions to their Governors on this head, and after all, have failed of &s;ucce&s;s?</P>
<P>IT is however, devoutly to be wi&s;hed, that when a happy reconciliation once takes place, this poi&s;on|ous branch may entirely be &s;hut out, before our great commercial &s;tream becomes &s;o infected by the contagion, as to endanger the health and &s;ecurity of the whole empire.</P></NOTE> We rather

tremble for the parent &s;tate, and would fain keep off from our own borders, tho&s;e lux|uries, which may perhaps already have im|paired her con&s;titutional vigour. We only wi&s;h, that what we have we may be able to call OUR OWN; that tho&s;e fruits of hone&s;t in|du&s;try, which our ance&s;tors had acquired or tho&s;e which have been, or may be added to them by the &s;weat of our own brows &s;hould not be wre&s;ted from us by the hand of vio|lence, but left to our own free di&s;po&s;al; &s;atis|fied as we are in our con&s;ciences, that when

CONSTITUTIONALLY called upon, we &s;hall not give "GRUDGINGLY OR OF NECESSITY", but chearfully and liberally.</P>
<P>And as to any preten&s;ions to, or even de|&s;ire of independency, have we not openly di&s;avowed them in all our petitions, repre&s;ent|tations and remon&s;trances? Have we not re|peatedly and &s;olemnly profe&s;&s;ed an inviolable loyalty to the per&s;on, power and dignity of our SOVEREIGN, and unanimou&s;ly declared, that it is not with HIM we contend, but with an envious Cloud of FALSE WITNESSES, that &s;urround his throne, and intercept the &s;un&s;hine of his favour from our oppre&s;&s;ed Land?</P>
<P>IF, notwith&s;tanding all this, BRITAIN or rather &s;ome degenerate &s;ons of BRITAIN, and enemies to our common Liberty, &s;till per&s;i&s;t in embracing a DELUSION, and believing a LIE&mdash;if the &s;word is &s;till un&s;heathed again&s;t us, and SUBMIT OR PERISH is the &s;anguinary de|cree&mdash;why then&mdash;I CANNOT clo&s;e the &s;entence&mdash;Indulge a Mini&s;ter of JESUS!&mdash;My &s;oul &s;hrinks back with horror from the tragic &s;cene of fraternal &s;laughter&mdash;and the free &s;pirit of the citizen

is arre&s;ted by the tenderne&s;s of Go&s;pel love.&mdash;GRACIOUS GOD! &s;top the precious ef|fu&s;ion of Briti&s;h and American blood&mdash;too precious to be &s;pared in any other cau&s;e than the joint intere&s;t of both again&s;t a common foe!&mdash;</P>
<P>PAINED, as I am at this melancholy pro|&s;pect, I mean not, however, to decline ad|dre&s;&s;ing you in your military capacity, and &s;ugge&s;ting &s;uch a conduct for the pre&s;ervation of your temporal rights, as by the ble&s;&s;ing of Heaven, will be mo&s;t likely to en&s;ure you &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>"STAND FAST" then.</P>
<P>I. "STAND FAST" by a &s;trong FAITH and dependence upon JESUS CHRIST, the great Captain of your Salvation. Enli&s;t un|der the Banner of his Cro&s;s. And let this motto be written upon your hearts, IN HOC SIGNO VINCES, "UNDER THIS STANDARD THOU SHALT OVERCOME."</P>
<P>II. "STAND FAST" by a virtuous and un&s;haken UNANIMITY. Of &s;uch an unanimi|ty, you have a mo&s;t &s;triking example now
<PB N="20" REF="014013_0026_0F92874AE055FC10">
before your eyes&mdash;three millions of people, or a va&s;t majority of them, bound by no other ties than tho&s;e of honour and public virtue, voluntarily &s;ubmitting to the wi&s;e Political Determinations of an Honourable Council of Delegates a&s;&s;embled by their own free and unbia&s;&s;ed choice. Avail your&s;elves of this illu&s;trious example. Be unanimous in your particular department. And as one refrac|tory &s;pirit may defeat the be&s;t-devi&s;ed plan of operations, and throw your whole Corps into confu&s;ion, &s;ee that this unanimity be productive of a ju&s;t and becoming SUBORDI|NATION.</P>
<P>REMEMBER, the Gentlemen who com|mand you are your Neighbours, Friends and Fellow-Citizens, who have their ALL at &s;take as well as you. Their authority has not been impo&s;ed upon you. They were inve&s;ted with it by your&s;elves. 'Tis &s;urely your part then to &s;upport them in the ju&s;t execution of it; not doubting, but that on their part they will al|ways con&s;ider, that they are not called to lord it over mercenaries, but affectionately to command Freemen and Fellow-Sufferers.
<PB N="21" REF="014013_0027_0F92874C72D81530">
Accu&s;tom your&s;elves, therefore, to di&s;cipline now; or el&s;e, when the day of trial comes, (which Heaven avert!) you will too late la|ment your unhappy neglect.</P>
<P>III. STAND FAST" by an undaunted COURAGE and MAGNANIMITY. And here give me leave to remind you, that there is a kind of courage, which &s;eems to be merely animal or con&s;titutional.&mdash;This may &s;tand a Soldier in good &s;tead perhaps for a few mo|ments amid the heat and fury of a battle when his blood and &s;pirits are &s;et on fire by the warlike &s;ound of drums and trumpets. But I would have YOU po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of more than this, even a courage that will prove you to be good Chri&s;tians, as well as good Soldiers, a firm invincible fortitude of &s;oul, founded upon religion, and the glorious hope of a better world; a courage, that will enable you not only to with&s;tand an armed phalanx, to pierce a &s;quadron, or force an entrenchment, when the cau&s;e of virtue and your country calls you to &s;uch a &s;ervice, but will &s;upport you, like|wi&s;e, again&s;t the principalities and powers of

darkne&s;s, will &s;tand by you under the a&s;&s;aults of pain and &s;ickne&s;s, and give you firmne&s;s and con&s;olation amid all the horrors of a death-bed &s;cene.</P>
<P>SUCH a courage as this too will always be tempered with prudence, humanity, and greatne&s;s of &s;oul. It will never degenerate into Savage cruelty and barbarity. If to &s;pread undi&s;tingui&s;hing ruin and deva&s;tation through a country; if with more than Gothic rage, to break into the &s;weet retreats of do|me&s;tic felicity and drive the aged and the helple&s;s from their once quiet habitations&mdash;O my GOD! if this be heroi&s;m, if this be mi|litary virtue&mdash;&s;uffer not our people to learn the de&s;tructive art. Let them rather continue to be injured and oppre&s;&s;ed them&s;elves, than taught thus wantonly to injure and oppre&s;s others. This caution, however, is unnece&s;|&s;ary to you. Permit me, then only to ob&s;erve, that in our pre&s;ent circum&s;tances, we contend not for Victory, but for Liberty and peace.</P>
<P>NOR let me di&s;mi&s;s this head of advice without reminding you of the glorious &s;tand

that hath been already made for us by our northern Brethren, and calling upon you to thank Heaven for his great and gracious in|terpo&s;ition. Surely "the Lord of Ho&s;ts was with them"&mdash;&s;urely "the God of Jacob was their refuge."&mdash;Drop a pious tear to the memory of the illu&s;trious &s;lain&mdash;and let them yet live in the annals of American Freedom.</P>
<P>LASTLY, "STAND FAST" by a &s;teady CONSTANCY and PERSEVERANCE. Difficul|ties unlooked for may yet ari&s;e, and trials pre&s;ent them&s;elves &s;ufficient to &s;hake the ut|mo&s;t firmne&s;s of human fortitude. Be pre|pared, therefore, for the wor&s;t. Suffer not your &s;pirits to evaporate by too violent an ebullition now. Be not too eager to bring matters to an extremity; le&s;t you &s;hould be wearied out by a continued exertion, and your con&s;tancy &s;hould fail you at the mo&s;t important cri&s;is. Coolly and deliberately wait for tho&s;e events which are in the hands of Providence, and depend upon him alone for &s;trength and expedients &s;uited to your nece&s;&s;ities.</P>
