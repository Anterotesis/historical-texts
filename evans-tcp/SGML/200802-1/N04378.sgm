<HEAD>THE PREFACE:</HEAD>
<P><HI>THE Reader mu&s;t not expect in the following Sheets, a particular and minute Relation of every Formality, Que&s;tion and An&s;wer that pa&s;s'd upon the Trials, it may &s;uffice, if he be a&s;&s;ured he has the Sub&s;tance; for indeed more cannot be expected, when it is con&s;idered, that we have no One here, as in our Mother Country, who make it a Bu&s;ine&s;s to take Notes upon &s;uch Occa&s;ions; or any others, that we know of, who are &s;o dexterous at Short-Hand, as to be &s;ufficiently qualified for &s;uch a Purpo&s;e; but he will be &s;ure to have all that could be collected from the Notes that were taken by the Court, and Gentlemen at the Bar; with all which the Compiler has been furni&s;hed.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Upon a Review of the Proceedings, in order for this Undertaking, the Bulk of them, which was the Product of about</HI> Six Months Enquiry, <HI>&s;eem'd &s;omewhat di&s;couraging: No doubt, they might have been conracted, if this Work had been proceeded upon in the Method of an Hi&s;torical Relation only, wherein the Compiler would have been more at Liberty to ab&s;tract the &s;everal Originals; but it was concluded,</HI> a Journal <HI>would give more Satisfaction, ina&s;much as in &s;uch a kind of Proce&s;s, the Depo&s;itions and Examinations them&s;elves, which were the Ground-work of the Pro|ceedings, would appear at large; which mo&s;t probably would afford Conviction, to &s;uch as have a Di&s;po&s;ition to be convinc'd, and have</HI> in Reality <HI>doubted, whether any par|ticular Convicts had Ju&s;tice done them or not, notwith&s;tanding they had the Oppor|tunity of</HI> &s;eeing <HI>and</HI> hearing <HI>a great deal concerning them; and others, who had not &s;uch Opportunities, who were prejudiced at a Di&s;tance in their Disfavour, by frivolous Reports, might the readier be undeceiv'd: For as the Proceedings are &s;et forth in the Order of Time they were produced, the Reader will thereby be furni&s;hed with the mo&s;t natural View of the Whole; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e better enabled to conceive the De&s;ign and dangerous Depth of this</HI> helli&s;h Project, <HI>as well as the Ju&s;tice of the &s;everal Pro&s;ecutions.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thus far, however, the Compiler thinks proper to premi&s;e, that as he found it convenient to divide the Originals into number'd Sections, for the more ready Reference to the &s;everal Parts of them, as Occa&s;ion &s;hould offer; he took the Liberty al&s;o of lopping off from them, what, in print, he thought would be a &s;uperfluous Formality, &s;uch as</HI> The Deponent further &s;aith, <HI>and &s;uch like, which he thought would have been a needle&s;s Incumbrance to the Book.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="ii" REF="005413_0003_101739270FE1B838">
<HI>The Parties accu&s;ed of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> were numerous, and Bu&s;ine&s;s by Degrees multiplied &s;o fa&s;t upon the Grand Jury,</HI> which bore the Burthen of this Enquiry, <HI>that there would have been an immediate Nece&s;&s;ity for others to have lent a helping Hand in taking Examinations</HI> from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Beginning, <HI>if the Judges had not found it expedient to examine the Per&s;ons accu&s;ed, upon their fir&s;t taking into Cu&s;tody, whereby it &s;eemed mo&s;t likely the Truth would bolt out, before they had Time to cool, or Opportunity of di&s;cour&s;ing in the Jail with their Confederates who were before committed.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The Examinations thus taken by the Judges, were &s;oon after laid before the Grand Jury, who interrogated the Parties therefrom in &s;uch manner, as generally produced from them the Sub&s;tance of the &s;ame Matter, and often &s;omething more, by which Means there accrued no &s;mall Advantage; for though where the la&s;t Examination brought to light new Di&s;covery, yet it will be &s;eldom found, there is any Thing in &s;uch further Examinations contradictory to the former, but generally a Confirmation of them; and in &s;uch Ca&s;e, the &s;etting forth the &s;ame at large, may not be thought a u&s;ele&s;s Tautology; not that this will happen often, and where it does, 'twill be chiefly found in the Examinations and Confe&s;&s;ions of Negroes, who, in ordinary Ca&s;es, are &s;eldom found to hold twice in the &s;ame Story; which, for its Rarety therefore, if it carried not with it the additional Weight of the greater Appearance of Truth, may make this Particular the more excu&s;able; and further, this is</HI> a Diary <HI>of the Proceed|ings, that is to be exhibited; therefore, in Conformity to that Plan, Nothing &s;hould be omitted, which may be of any U&s;e.</HI></P>
<P><HI>All proper Precautions were taken by the Judges, that the Criminals &s;hould be kept &s;eparate; and they were &s;o as much as the &s;canty Room in the Jail would admit of; and new Appartments were accordingly fitted up for their Reception: But more particular Care was taken, that &s;uch Negroes as had made Confe&s;&s;ion and Di&s;covery, and were to be made U&s;e of as Witne&s;&s;es, &s;hould be kept a-part from the re&s;t, and as much from each other, as the Accommodations would allow of, in order to prevent their caballing together; and the Witne&s;&s;es were always examined a-part from each other fir&s;t, as well upon the Trials, as otherwi&s;e, and then generally confronted with the Per&s;ons they accu&s;ed, who were u&s;ually &s;ent for and taken into Cu&s;tody upon &s;uch Examinations, if they were to be met with; which was the Means of bringing many others to a Confe&s;&s;ion, as well &s;uch as were newly taken up, as tho&s;e who had long before been committed, perhaps upon &s;lighter Grounds, and had in&s;i&s;ted upon their Innocence; for they had generally the Cunning not to own their Guilt, 'til they knew their Accu&s;ers: But notwith&s;tanding this was the ordinary Method taken, both by the Judges and Grand Jury, to &s;end for the Parties as &s;oon as impeached, (which however might &s;ometimes through Hurry be omitted) yet &s;everal who happen'd

then to be out of the Way, were afterwards forg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t, and &s;lipt through our Fingers, from the Multiplicity of Bu&s;ine&s;s in Hand, as will hereafter appear; which</HI> therefore <HI>is particularly recommended to the Notice of their Owners.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The Trouble of examining Criminals in general, may be ea&s;ily gue&s;s'd at; but the Fatigue in that of Negroes, is not to be conceived, but by tho&s;e that have undergone the Drudgery: The Difficulty of bringing, and holding them to the Truth, if by Chance it &s;tarts from them, is not to be &s;urmounted but by the clo&s;e&s;t Attention; many of them have a great deal of Craft; their unintelligible Jargon &s;tands them in great Stead, to conceal their Meaning; &s;o that an Examiner mu&s;t expect to encounter with much Perplexity; grope through a Maze of Ob&s;curity; be obliged to lay hold of broken Hints, lay them carefully together, and thoroughly weigh and compare them with each other, before he can be able to &s;ee the Light, or fix tho&s;e Creatures to any certain determinate Meaning.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Though for the Rea&s;ons before mentioned, all the Trials could not be &s;et forth at large; yet on the principal Trials, &s;uch as,</HI> The Hugh&s;ons, Ury the Prie&s;t, Quack and Cuffee, <HI>(the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> fir&s;t Negroes executed for the Con&s;piracy) and that of</HI> the five Spani&s;h Slaves, <HI>the Court and Gentlemen at the Bar, took Notes more largely; but as to the re&s;t, though there were here and there &s;ome Minutes taken, (which are al&s;o &s;et forth in their proper Places) yet they did not think them equally worth the Pains; therefore upon other Trials, the Paragraphs or Sections of the Depo&s;itions of Whites, and the Examinations and Confe&s;&s;ions of Slaves, taken by the Judges, Grand Jury, or others, upon the Credit whereof &s;uch Slaves were indicted, are referred to upon their re&s;pective Trials: Which Method, if any &s;hould object to, as &s;ubject to Uncertainty, and &s;ay, the Witne&s;&s;es might not declare exactly the &s;ame Things, and in the &s;ame Words, or the Sub&s;tance of them, before the Court, as are contained in tho&s;e Depo&s;itions, Examinations and Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">fe&s;&s;ions referred to; the An&s;wer is,</HI></P>
<P>Fir&s;t, <HI>'Tis mo&s;t likely they did not, (nor could it be expected they &s;hould) deliver them&s;elves preci&s;ely in the &s;ame Words: But Ab&s;tracts were taken of tho&s;e Evidences, and Briefs prepared for the Council concern'd in each Trial, pointing out the &s;everal Articles affecting each Criminal; whereby the Council were readily led to a&s;k a Witne&s;s &s;uch Que&s;tions as would naturally draw out the Sub&s;tance of the &s;ame Matter in An&s;wer, if it were the Truth; and it was ob&s;erved by tho&s;e more immediately concerned in the&s;e Affairs, and who&s;e Province it was to give clo&s;e Attention to them, that the Witne&s;&s;es both Whites and Blacks, generally kept clo&s;e to the Text, and delivered in Court the Sub&s;tance of the Evidence they had before given in their Depo&s;itions, Examinations, and Confe&s;&s;ions.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="005413_0005_1017392BB1333ED0">
Secondly, <HI>That what the Witne&s;&s;es did actualy declare in Court upon the Trials, was &s;ufficient to convince</HI> twelve <HI>hone&s;t Men upon their Oaths, that the Accu&s;ed were guilty; and there is no other Way left to furni&s;h the Reader with the Grounds which gave &s;uch Conviction to the Juries.</HI></P>
<P><HI>For the further</HI> enlightening <HI>the Ma&s;ters and Owners of Slaves accu&s;ed, convicted upon their own Confe&s;&s;ions, and tran&s;ported, and of others who were di&s;charged from Confinement,</HI> (for want of &s;ufficient Evidence, as 'twas &s;aid, before THE SECOND GRAND JURY, who were charged to continue the Enquiry concerning this infernal Scheme) <HI>the Evidence affecting each, is referr'd to under every &s;uch Negro's Con|fe&s;&s;ion, excepting as to &s;uch of them as were made U&s;e of as Witne&s;&s;es, which was thought needle&s;s; for their Te&s;timony having gained &s;ufficient Credit, it can &s;carce be &s;uppo&s;ed there will be any Doubt of their own Guilt: But if there &s;hould be any who he&s;itate concerning it, all that can be &s;aid, is, it will behove &s;uch to give the clo&s;er Attention to the &s;everal Depo&s;itions, Examinations and Confe&s;&s;ions, which impeach them.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The Evidence likewi&s;e affecting each White Per&s;on apprehended upon the Account of this Con&s;piracy, that was afterwards di&s;charged for want of Pro&s;ecution, is referred to under their re&s;pective Names, that it may appear what Rea&s;on there was for their Commitment and Accu&s;ation, tho' they were di&s;charged for Want of Indictment.</HI></P>
<P><HI>It has been thought proper to add, at the End of this Journal, Li&s;ts of all the Whites and Blacks accu&s;ed of this Con&s;piracy, tho&s;e who were executed, and tho&s;e who were pardoned upon Condition of Tran&s;portation, or otherwi&s;e di&s;charged from Jail, &s;hewing the re&s;pective Times of their Commitment, Arraignment, Conviction, Execution or Di&s;charge; whereby the Reader will be enabled to turn to almo&s;t any Part of the Journal to &s;atisfy his Curio&s;ity, as to what mo&s;t materialy concerns each re&s;pective Con&s;pirator; and with a View al&s;o to &s;hew to what Places &s;uch of them as were tran&s;ported (according to Information received) were &s;hipp'd; which is premi&s;ed, as a mode&s;t Hint to our Brethren in the</HI> We&s;t-Indies, <HI>and the more neighbouring Engli&s;h Colonies, that they may &s;ee how tender we have been of</HI> their <HI>Peace and Security, by u&s;ing all the Precaution in our Power,</HI> that none of our Rogues &s;hould be impo&s;ed upon them; <HI>for it was made an expre&s;s Condition in the &s;everal Pardons, and likewi&s;e the Recognizances entered into by the Securities for Slaves tran&s;ported,</HI> <Q><HI>That the Per&s;ons pardoned &s;hould be tran&s;ported to the Dominion of &s;ome foreign Prince or State or the I&s;land of</HI> Newfoundland <HI>[by a time therein limitted] and if any of the Negroes or Slaves [pardoned by the Letters Patent] &s;hould at any Time after [the Day therein limitted]</HI> be found in any of his Maje&s;ty's Dominions, <HI>except</HI> New|foundland, <HI>the Letters Patent as to all and every the Per&s;on and Per&s;ons &s;o found,

<P><HI>Many, it &s;eems, have wondered, that this Journal has not made its Appearance long ago; for, &s;ay they, the Thing dies away, and is almo&s;t forgotten (the more's the Pity) and now People will hardly take the Pains to give it a Peru&s;al.</HI></P>
<P><HI>To which it is an&s;wered; That it was &s;ome Time before the Compiler could &s;ubmit him&s;elf to undergo <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Drudgery of this kind, for &s;everal Rea&s;ons, the Ta&s;k was not very inviting, and he had borne a &s;ufficient Fatigue, under an ill State of Health, in the Share he had in the Proceedings them&s;elves, for a Cour&s;e of &s;ix Months daily Attendance, and it was &s;ome Time before he could ab&s;olutely determine to undertake it, and did &s;et about it in earne&s;t; and &s;ince that, the Duties of his Offices and Profe&s;&s;ion have occa&s;ioned many Interruptions; and when the Attention is withdrawn for a Time from a Subject, it may not always &s;uit the Humour to re-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;&s;ume it, e&s;pecially a Matter of this Nature; nor perhaps can the Thoughts concerning it be ea&s;ily collected again; not that this Bu&s;ine&s;s required much Intention, but Recollection and Care were nece&s;&s;ary to introduce every Matter properly and give it Connexion in its due Order of Time, towards which the Compiler had the advantage of being all along privy to the Proceedings, and all the Motions concerning them.</HI></P>
<P><HI>There were Rea&s;ons indeed, for making the&s;e Matters publick, which could not be with&s;tood.</HI></P>
<P><HI>There had been &s;ome wanton, wrong-headed Per&s;ons among&s;t us, who took the Liberty to arraign the Ju&s;tice of the Proceedings, and &s;et up their private Opinions in Superiority to the Court and Grand Jury; tho' God knows (and all Men of Sen&s;e know) they could not be Judges of &s;uch Matters; but neverthele&s;s, they declared with no &s;mall A&s;&s;urance (notwith&s;tanding what we</HI> &s;aw <HI>with our Eyes, and</HI> heard <HI>with our Ears, and every one might have judg'd of by his Intellects, that had any)</HI> That there was no Plot at all! <HI>The Inference</HI> &s;uch <HI>would have drawn from thence, is too obvious to need mentioning: However this moved very little: It was not to</HI> convince <HI>(for that would have been a vain Undertaking;</HI> the AEthiopian might a&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">oon change his Skin) <HI>much le&s;s was it to gratify</HI> &s;uch.</P>
<P><HI>But there were two Motives which weighed much; the</HI> one, <HI>that tho&s;e who had not the Opportunity of</HI> &s;eeing <HI>and</HI> hearing, <HI>might judge of the Ju&s;tice of the Proceed|ings from the State of the Ca&s;e being laid before them; the</HI> other, <HI>that from thence the People in general, might be per&s;uaded of the Nece&s;&s;ity there i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, for every One that has Negroes, to keep a very watchful Eye over them, and not to indulge them with too great Liberties, which we find they make U&s;e of to the wor&s;t Purpo&s;es, caballing

and confederating together <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, in great Numbers, when they may, from the Accounts in the en&s;uing Sheets, from what they</HI> &s;ee <HI>has happen'd,</HI> feel <HI>the Con&s;equence of giving them &s;o great a Latitude, as has been cu&s;tomary within this City and Province, and thereby be warned to keep them&s;elves upon a &s;trict Guard again&s;t</HI> the&s;e Enemies of their own Hou&s;hold, <HI>&s;ince we know what they are capable of; for it was notorious, that tho&s;e among them, who had the kinde&s;t Ma&s;ters, who fared be&s;t, and had the mo&s;t Liberty; nay, that tho&s;e in whom their Ma&s;ters placed the greate&s;t Confidence, in&s;omuch, that they would even have put their own Swords into their Hands, in Expectation of being defended by them again&s;t their own Colour, did neverthele&s;s turn out the greate&s;t Villains: It even appeared, that the&s;e</HI> head Fellows <HI>boa&s;ted of</HI> their Superiority <HI>over the more harmle&s;s and inoffen&s;ive; that they held them in an Inferiority and Dependence, a kind of Subjection, as if they had got &s;uch Dominion over them,</HI> that they dur&s;t not, at any Time, or upon any Occa&s;ion, but do as they would have them; <HI>from whence it may be gue&s;&s;ed, how likely the Defection was to be general.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The principal Inducement, therefore, to this Undertaking, was,</HI> the publick Benefit; <HI>that tho&s;e who have Property in Slaves, might have a la&s;ting Memento concerning the Nature of them; that they may be thence warned to keep a con&s;tant Guard over them; &s;ince what they have done, they may one Time or other act over again; e&s;pecially if there &s;hould in future Times, appear,</HI> &s;uch Mon&s;ters in Nature, <HI>as the</HI> Hugh&s;ons, Ury the Prie&s;t; and &s;uch like, <HI>who dare be &s;o wicked as to attempt the &s;educing them to &s;uch execrable Purpo&s;es: And if any &s;hould think it not worth their While to learn from the en&s;uing Sheets (what by others perhaps may be e&s;teemed)</HI> a u&s;eful Le&s;&s;on, <HI>the Fault will be their own; and realy it was thought</HI> nece&s;&s;ary, <HI>for the&s;e and other Rea&s;ons needle&s;s here to mention, that there &s;hould be a &s;tanding Memorial of &s;o unprecedented a Scheme of Villainy.</HI></P>
<P><HI>But though the Compiler was willing to make an Offering of his</HI> own Time, <HI>to the Publick Service, by laying the&s;e Matters in Order, for the Pre&s;s; yet being under no other Influence &s;o to do, than his Inclination and Readine&s;s to oblige the Publick, he was at Liberty however to &s;uit his own Convenience; and therefore, con&s;idering the Multiplicity of the Proceedings, it may,</HI> after all, <HI>rather be thought,</HI> Matter of Wonder, <HI>that it makes its Appearance &s;o &s;oon.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Perhaps it may not come forth</HI> un&s;ea&s;onably <HI>at this</HI> Juncture, <HI>if the Di&s;tractions occa&s;ioned by this</HI> My&s;tery of Iniquity, <HI>may be thereby &s;o revived in our Memories, as to awaken us from that &s;upine Security, which again too generally prevails, and put us upon our Guard, le&s;t the Enemy &s;hould be yet within our Doors.</HI></P>

<P>The Occa&s;ion of this Robbery, as was di&s;covered, and will appear more fully hereafter, was one <HI>Wil&s;on,</HI> a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ad of about &s;eventeen or eighteen Years of Age, belonging to the <HI>Flamborough</HI> Man of War, on this Station; who having Acquaintance with two white Servants belonging to Gentlemen who lodged at Mr. <HI>Hogg'</HI>s Hou&s;e, <HI>Wil&s;on</HI> u&s;ed frequently to come thither on that Pretence, which gained him ea&s;y Admittance: But <HI>Wil&s;on,</HI> it &s;eems, had a more familiar Acquaintance with &s;ome Negroes of very &s;u&s;picious Characters, particularly <HI>Cae&s;ar,</HI> belonging to <HI>John Vaarck,</HI> B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ker; <HI>Prince,</HI> to Mr. <HI>John Auboyneau,</HI> Merchant, and <HI>Cuffee,</HI> to <HI>Adolph Philip&s;e,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q;</ABBR></P>
<Q>The Thur&s;day before this Robbery was committed, <HI>Wil&s;on</HI> came to Mr. <HI>Hogg'</HI>s Shop with one of the Man-of-War's People, to buy &s;ome checqued Linnen; and having bargained for &s;ome, Part of the Money offered in Payment was of Spani&s;h Coin; and Mrs. <HI>Hogg</HI> opening her Bureau to change the Money, pulled out <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Drawer in the View of <HI>Wil&s;on,</HI> wherein were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> con|&s;iderable Quantity of mill'd Spani&s;h Pieces of Eight: She &s;oon reflected that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> had done wrong in expo&s;ing her Money to an idle <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> in that manner, who came &s;o frequently to her Hou&s;e, and immediately &s;hut up the Bureau again, and made a Pretence of &s;ending the Money out to a Neighbour's to be weighed.</Q>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Hogg'</HI>s Apprehen&s;ions happened to be right; for this Boy having a Sight of the Money, was charmed with it, and, as it &s;eems, wanted to be fingering of it; he told his Comrades of the Black-Guard, the before named <HI>Cae&s;ar, Prince</HI> and <HI>Cuffee,</HI> where they might have a fine Booty, if they could manage cleverly to come at it; he &s;aid, it was at <HI>Hogg'</HI>s Hou&s;e in the Broad-Street; his Wife kept a Shop of Goods, and &s;old Candles, Rum and Mola&s;&s;es, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>The Negroes catched at the Propo&s;al, and the Scheme was communicated by them to <HI>John Hugh&s;on,</HI> who kept a Publick Hou&s;e by the North River in this City, a Place where Numbers of Negroes u&s;ed to re&s;ort, and be entertained privately (in Defiance of the Law<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">) at all Hours, as ap|peared afterwards, and will be &s;hewn at large in the en&s;uing Sheets: Thither they u&s;ed to bring &s;uch Goods as they &s;tole from their Ma&s;ters or others, and <HI>Hugh&s;on,</HI> his Wife and Family, received them: There they held a Con|&s;ultation with <HI>Hugh&s;on</HI> and his Family, how they &s;hould act in order to compa&s;s the Attainment of this Booty.</P>
<P>The Boy <HI>(Wil&s;on)</HI> told them the Situation of the Hou&s;e and Shop; that the Front was towards Broad-Street; that there was a Side Door out of the Shop into a little Lane, commonly called the Jews-Alley, and if they could contrive an Errand thither to buy Rum, they might take an

<HEAD>WEDNESDAY, 18th MARCH.</HEAD>
<P>ABOUT One o'Clock this Day a Fire broke out of the Roof of his Maje&s;ty's Hou&s;e at <HI>Fort George,</HI> within this City, near the Chappel: When the Alarm of a Fire was fir&s;t given, it was ob&s;erved from the Town, that the Middle of the Roof was in a great Smoke, but not a Spark of Fire appeared on the Out-&s;ide for a con&s;iderable Time; and when it fir&s;t broke out, it was on the Ea&s;t Side, about Twenty Feet from the End next the Chappel, and in a &s;hort Time afterwards, it made it's Way through the Roof in &s;everal Places, at a Di&s;tance from the Fir&s;t, and each other. Upon the Chappel Bell's ringing, great Numbers of People, Gentlemen and others, came to the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Lieu|tenant Governor and his Family; and as the People of this City, to do them Ju&s;tice, are very active and diligent upon the&s;e Occa&s;ions, mo&s;t of the Hou&s;hold Goods, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> were removed out and &s;aved, and the Fire Engines were in a little Time brought thither; but the Wind blowing a vio|lent Gale at S. E. as &s;oon as the Fire appeared in different Places of the Roof, it was judged impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ave the Hou&s;e and Chappel; &s;o that Endeavours were u&s;ed to &s;ave the Secretary's Office over the Fort Gate, where the Records of the Colony were repo&s;ited; and al&s;o the Barracks which &s;tood on the Side of the Quadrangle oppo&s;ite to the Hou&s;e; &s;uch Diligence was u&s;ed in removing the Records, Books and Papers from the Former, many of which for Di&s;patch were thrown out of the Windows next the Town, that mo&s;t of them were pre&s;erved; and though, from the Violence of the Wind, the Papers were blown about the Streets, we don't hear that any very material Writings were lo&s;t; but the Fire had got hold of the Roof of the Office &s;oon after they began to remove the Records, and though the Engines played &s;ome time upon it and afterwards upon the Barracks, they were of little Service, the Wind blowing very hard, and the Flames of the Hou&s;e being &s;o near them, all &s;eemed to be at their Mercy; and an Alarm being given that there was Gun-Powder in the Fort, whether through Fear and an Apprehen&s;ion that there was, or whether the Hint was given by &s;ome of the Con&s;pirators them&s;elves, with artful De&s;ign to intimidate the People, and frighten them from giving further A&s;&s;i&s;tance, we cannot &s;ay; though the Lieu|tenant Governor declared to every Body, that there was none there; yet they had not the Courage to depend upon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Honour's A&s;&s;urance: But however, it happened, mo&s;t of them de&s;erted it, 'till they found that many Gentlemen remained upon the Spot; though, had they all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ayed, it was thought it would have been to little Purpo&s;e; for &s;uch was the Violence of the Wind, and the Flames &s;pread &s;o fa&s;t, that, in about an Hour and a Quarter's Time, the Hou&s;e was burnt down to the Ground, and the Chappel and other Buildings beyond human Power of &s;aving any material Part of them: At length the Fire got to the Stables without the Fort, and the Wind blew fired Shingles upon the Hou&s;es in the Town next the North River, &s;o that there was the utmo&s;t Danger of its &s;preading further; which occa&s;ioned many Families to remove their Goods; but at la&s;t it was &s;topp'd at the Governor's Stables, with very little Damage to the Hou&s;es in the Town.</P>
<P>While the Records were removing from the Secretary's Office, there fell a moderate Shower of Rain, which was of &s;ome &s;mall Service; and when the Buildings were down to the Ground Floor, &s;ome Hand Gran<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> Shells, which had lain &s;o long as to be forgotten, took Fire, and went off, which few or none but the Officers of the Fort, could ac|count for, or imagine what was the Matter; nor would it have been worth while to have attempted their Removal, if they had been thought of; for the Buildings in the Fort were at that time all given over for lo&s;t; but this &s;erved to con|firm the Generality of the People in the Notion, that there was Powder in the Fort, and if they could have done any good, this would probably have prevented them.</P>
<P>But though the Floors of the &s;everal Buildings &s;oon tum|bled in, there were many Pieces of Timber which were laid in the Walls of the Hou&s;e, Chappel Steeple, and other Buildings, which continued burning almo&s;t all the Night after; &s;o that we could not think the Town quite out of Danger of further Mi&s;chief, 'till tho&s;e Timbers were en|tirely con&s;umed; for 'twas apprehended, as the Fort &s;tood upon an Eminence, that the Wind according as it &s;hould have happened to change, might have blown &s;ome of the Fire upon the Hou&s;es in the Town, which, for the mo&s;t Part, have &s;hingled Roofs; therefore Care was taken to keep a watchful Guard all the Night to prevent further Da|mage.</P>

Mr. <HI>Cornelius Van Horne,</HI> a Captain of one of the Companies of the Militia, very providently beat to Arms in the Evening, and drew out his Men with all Expedition; had Seventy odd of them under Arms all Night, and Par|ties of them continually going the Rounds of the City, 'till Day-Light: This Incident, from what will appear here|after, may be thought to have been a very fortunate One, and de&s;erving of a more particular Remark, though at that time <HI>&s;ome People were &s;o infatuated, as to reproach that Gen|tleman for it, as a Madman.</HI></P>
<P>The only Way of accounting for this Misfortune at this Time was, The Lieutenant Governor had ordered a Plum|mer that Morning to mend a Leak in the Gutter between the Hou&s;e and the Chappel, which joined upon one an|other, and the Man carrying his Fire-Pot with Coals to keep his Soddering-Iron hot, to perform his Work; and the Wind &s;etting into the Gutter, 'twas thought, &s;ome Sparks had been blown out upon the Shingles of the Hou&s;e; but &s;ome People having ob&s;erved, that upon the fir&s;t Alarm, as before, near half the Roof, as they gue&s;&s;ed, was covered with Smoke, and that no Spark of Fire appeared without, nor could any be &s;een, but within; it was by them con|cluded, that the Rea&s;on a&s;&s;igned was not likely to be the right One, e&s;pecially when it was con&s;idered, that at length, the Fire broke out in &s;everal Places of the Roof, di&s;tant from each other; but no one imagined it was done on Pur|po&s;e.</P>

<P>ANOTHER Week from the La&s;t, a Fire broke out at the Storehou&s;e of Mr. <HI>Van Zant,</HI> towards the Ea&s;t End of the Town.

<HEAD>SATURDAY, 4th APRIL.</HEAD>
<P>THIS Evening there was an Alarm of a Fire at the Hou&s;e of one <HI>Quick,</HI> or <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> (for they both lived under one Roof) in the Fly: upon Inquiry, the Fire was found to be in a Cow&s;table near the Hou&s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">; the Hay was on Fire in the Middle of it; but by timely A&s;&s;i&s;tance, it was &s;uppre&s;&s;ed.</P>

It began in the Lof<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> of the Kitchen, was di&s;covered by the Smoke be|fore the Fire had got any Head, and was &s;oon extingui&s;hed: Upon Examination, it was found, that Fire had been put between a Straw and another Bed laid together, whereon a Negro &s;lept, but who did it, or how the Fire happened at <HI>Quick'</HI>s, remained to be accounted for.</P>

<HEAD>SUNDAY, 5th APRIL.</HEAD>
<P>A Di&s;covery was made in the Morning early, that &s;ome Coals had been put under a Hay&s;tack, &s;tanding near the Coach-Hou&s;e and Stables of <HI>Jo&s;eph Murray,</HI> <ABBR>E&s;q;</ABBR> in the Broad Way, and near &s;ome Dwelling Hou&s;es there, which had it them Fire, would have been in great Danger;
<PB N="7" REF="005413_0014_10173946B2B4AAC8">
but the Coals went out of them&s;elves, as &s;uppo&s;ed, having only &s;inged &s;ome Part of the Hay. It was &s;aid, there were Coals and A&s;hes traced along from the Fence to a neighbour|ing Hou&s;e next adjoining the Stables, which cau&s;ed a Su&s;pi|cion of the Negro that lived there.</P>

<P>This Sunday as three Negroes were walking up the Broad-Way towards the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Church, about Service Time, Mrs. <HI>Earle</HI> looking out of her Window, overheard one of them &s;aying to his Companions, with a vapouring Sort of an Air, <Q><HI>Fire, Fire, Scorch, Scorch,</HI> A LITTLE,&mdash;<HI>Damn it,</HI> BY-AND-BY,</Q> and then threw up his Hands, and laughed: The Woman conceived great Jealou&s;y at the&s;e Words, and thought it very odd Behaviour at that Juncture, con&s;idering what had &s;o lately happened; and &s;he putting the natural Con&s;truction upon them, her Apprehen|&s;ions made her unea&s;y, and &s;he immediately &s;poke of it to her next Neighbour Mrs. <HI>George,</HI> but &s;aid, <HI>&s;he did not know any of the Negroes.</HI></P>
<P>About an&punc; Hour after, when Church was out, Mrs. <HI>Earle</HI> &s;aw the &s;ame Negroes coming down the Broad-Way again, and pointed out to Mrs. <HI>George</HI> the Per&s;on who had &s;poke the Words; and Mrs. <HI>George</HI> knew him, and &s;aid, <HI>That is Mr.</HI> WALTER'<HI>s Quaco.</HI></P>

<HEAD>MONDAY, 6th APRIL.</HEAD>
<P>ABOUT Ten o'Clock in the Morning, there was an Alarm of a Fire at the Hou&s;e of Serjeant <HI>Burns,</HI> oppo&s;ite the Fort Garden: This, 'twas &s;aid, was only a Chimney; which, upon Enquiry, the Man declared, had been &s;wept the <HI>Friday</HI> before; but from the great Smother in the Hou&s;e, and &s;ome other Circum&s;tances; there were Grounds to &s;u&s;pect a villainous De&s;ign in it.</P>
<P>Towards Noon, a Fire broke out in the Roof of Mrs. <HI>Hilton'</HI>s Hou&s;e, at the Corner of the Buildings next the Fly Market, adjoining on the Ea&s;t Side of Capt. <HI>Sarly'</HI>s Hou&s;e: It fir&s;t broke out on that Side next <HI>Sarly'</HI>s; but being timely di&s;covered, was &s;oon prevented doing much, Mi&s;chief, more than burning Part of the Shingles of the Roof. Upon View, it was plain, that the Fire mu&s;t have been purpo&s;ely laid on the Wall-plate adjoining to the Shingle Roof; for a Hole bad been burnt deep in it, next that Part of the Roof where the Fire had taken hold of the Shingles; and it was &s;u&s;pected, that the Fire had been wrapt in a Bundle of Tow, for &s;ome was found near the Place: Thus the Fact was plain, but who did it, was a Que&s;tion remained to be determined: But there was a Cry among the People, <HI>The Spani&s;h Negroes; The Spani&s;h Negroes; Take up the Spani&s;h Negroes.</HI> The Occa&s;ion of this was the two Fires (<HI>Thomas'</HI>s and <HI>Hilton'</HI>s) happening &s;o clo&s;ely together, only one Day intervening, on each Side of Capt. <HI>Sarly'</HI>s Hou&s;e; and it being known, that <HI>Sarly</HI> had purcha&s;ed a Spani&s;h Negro, &s;ome Time before brought into this Port, among &s;everal others, in a Prize taken by Capt. <HI>Lu&s;h;</HI> all which Negroes were condemned as Slave<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> in the Court of Admiralty, and &s;old accordingly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> and that they afterwards pretending to have been Fr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> in their own Country, began to grumble at their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> U&s;age of being &s;old as Slaves: This probably gave Ri&s;e to the Su&s;picion, that this Negro, out of Revenge, had been the In&s;trument of the&s;e two Fires: and he behaving him&s;elf in&s;olently upon &s;ome People's a&s;king him Que&s;tion<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> concerning them, which &s;ignified their Di&s;tru&s;t; it was told to a Magi&s;trate who was near, and he order'd him to Goal, and al&s;o gave Direction to the Con&s;tables to commit all the Re&s;t of that Cargo, in order for their &s;afe Cu&s;tody and Examination.</P>
<P>In the Afternoon the Magi&s;trates met at the City-Hall, with Intent to examine them; and while the Ju&s;tices were proceeding to Examination, about Four o'Clock there was another Alarm of Fire: Upon Enquiry, and looking out of the Hall Windows, it was &s;een from thence, and found to be at Col. <HI>Philip&s;e'</HI>s Storehou&s;e. Upon the View of it, there was a &s;mall Streak of Fire running up the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> like Wild-fire, from near the Bottom to the Top of the Roof, on the Side directly <HI>again&s;t the Wind as it then blow:</HI> It not being far from the Engines, they were in&s;tantly brought to the Place: and the Fire, to one's great Surprize, almo&s;t a&s;&s;oon extingui&s;hed. This was the Middlemo&s;t of three large Storehou&s;es next each other in a Row, old

Timber-Buildings, and the Shingles burn'd like Tinder. Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e Storehou&s;es were not inhabited, nor had they a Chimney in them, but were at a great Di&s;tance from any. The Fire upon Examination, mu&s;t have begun within Side; for between the Side of tho&s;e Storehou&s;es, and the Hou&s;es <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> them, oppo&s;ite to the Wind, there was a large Space of Garden Ground; &s;o that no Sparks from the&s;e Chimneys could have occa&s;ion'd this Mi&s;chief, had the Wind blown the contrary Way; but to di&s;cover by whom the Fire was put, was the Difficulty.</P>
<P>While the People were extingui&s;hing the Fire at this Storehou&s;e, and had almo&s;t ma&s;tered it, there was another <HI>Cry of Fire;</HI> which diverted the People attending the Storehou&s;e, to the new Alarm, very few remaining behind: But a Man who had been on the Top of the Hou&s;e, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> in extingui&s;hing the Fire, &s;aw a Negro leap out at the End Window of one of them, from thence making over &s;everal Garden-Fences in great Ha&s;te; which occa|&s;ion'd him to cry out, <HI>A Negro, A Negro;</HI> and that was &s;oon improved into an Alarm, <HI>That the Negroes were ri&s;ing:</HI> The Negro made very good Speed home to his Ma&s;ter's; he was generally known; and the Swiftne&s;s of his Flight occa&s;ioned his being remark'd; though &s;carce <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> knew the Rea&s;on, but a few which remained at the Storehou&s;e, why the Word was given, <HI>A Negro, A Negro:</HI> It was immediately changed into <HI>Cuff Philip&s;e, Cuff Philip&s;e:</HI> The People ran to Mr. <HI>Philip&s;e'</HI>s Hou&s;e in Que&s;t of him; he was got in at the Back-Door; and being found, was dragged out of the Hou&s;e, and carried to Goal, borne upon the People's Shoulders. He was a Fellow of general ill Character; his Ma&s;ter being a &s;ingle Man and little at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, <HI>Cuff</HI> had a great deal of idle Time, which, it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, he employed to very ill Purpo&s;es, and had acquired a general bad Fame.</P>
<P>Many People had &s;uch terrible Apprehen&s;ions upon this Occa&s;ion, and indeed there was Cau&s;e &s;ufficient, that &s;everal Negroes (<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> many had been a&s;&s;i&s;ting at the Fire at the Storehou&s;e, and many perhaps that only &s;eemed to be &s;o) who were met in the Streets, after the Alarm of their ri&s;ing, were hurried away to Goal; and when they were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, they were continued &s;ome Time in Confinement before the Magi&s;trates could &s;pare Time to examine into their &s;everal Ca&s;es, how and for what they came there, many others fir&s;t coming under Con&s;ideration before them again&s;t whom there &s;eemed to be more direct Cau&s;e of Su&s;picion; but in a few Days, tho&s;e again&s;t whom nothing in particular was alledged, were di&s;charged.</P>
<P>It was &s;aid, there was like to have been another Fire this Day, though it has by &s;ome been &s;uppo&s;ed to have been an Accident: The Cellar of a Baker near <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ntjes</HI> Market was all of a Smother, and the Chips in a Blaze: but was &s;oon &s;uppre&s;&s;ed. This al&s;o occa&s;ion'd &s;ome Alarm.</P>
<P><HI>Quack (Walter'</HI>s) was &s;ent for and committed; he remained in Confinement &s;ome Days without Examina|tion, from the Hurry the Magi&s;trates were in; but at length Mrs. <HI>Earle</HI> and Mrs. <HI>George</HI> being &s;ent for by the Ju&s;tices, they declared concerning him to the Effect before-mentioned:<NOTE N="(e)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Sunday, 5th April.</HI></NOTE> And <HI>Quack</HI> being brought before them, and examined, by his Excu&s;e admitted he had &s;poken the Words he was charged with; but it being &s;oon after we had the News of Admiral <HI>Vernon'</HI>s taking <HI>Porto Bello,</HI> he had contrived a cunning Excu&s;e, or &s;ome abler Heads for him, to account for the Occa&s;ion of them, and brought two of his own Complexion to give their Words for it al&s;o, <HI>That they were talking of Admiral</HI> VERNON'<HI>s taking</HI> Porto Bello; <HI>and that he thereupon &s;ignified to his Companions, that he thought that was but a &s;mall F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">at to what this brave Officer would do</HI> by-and-by, <HI>to annoy the Spaniards;</HI> or Words tantamount; <HI>&s;o that it happen'd Quack</HI> was enlarged from his Confinement for &s;ome Time.</P>
<P>Others con&s;idering that it was but Eighteen Days after the Fort was laid in A&s;hes, that the&s;e Words were uttered; and that &s;everal other Fires had intervened, as before related; and but the next Day after <HI>Quick'</HI>s Stable and <HI>Ben Thomas'</HI>s Hou&s;e were on fire; and the Attempt upon Mr. <HI>Murray'</HI>s Hay&s;tack di&s;covered that very Morning; they were apt to put a different Con&s;truction upon <HI>Quack'</HI>s Words and Beha|viour; that he thereby meant, <Q>That the Fires which we had &s;een already, were nothing to what we &s;hould have <HI>by-and by,</HI> for that then we &s;hould have all the City in Flames, and he would rejoice at it;</Q> for it was &s;aid, he lifted up his Hands, and &s;pread them with a circular Sweep over his Head, after he had pronounced the Words <HI>[by and by] and then concluded with a loud Laugh.</HI> Whether the&s;e Figures are thus more properly applied, the Reader will hereafter be better able to judge; but the Con&s;truction of them at that Time confirmed many in the Notion of a Con&s;piracy; though they could not &s;u&s;pect One of &s;o black a Dye, as there were afterwards flagrant Proofs of, and will appear by and by.</P>

<P>THE RECORDER taking Notice of the &s;everal Fires which had lately happened in this City, and the Man|ner of them, which had put the Inhabitants into the utmo&s;t Con&s;ternation; that every one that reflected on the Cir|cum&s;tances attending them, the Frequency of them, and the Cau&s;es yet undi&s;covered; mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily conclude, that they were occa&s;ioned and &s;et on Foot by &s;ome villainous Confederacy of latent Enemies among&s;t us; but with what Intent or Purpo&s;e, Time mu&s;t di&s;cover; that it could not be doubted, but the Lieutenant Governor and His Maje&s;ty's Council had taken the Alarm at this Time of Danger, and were watchful, and anxious for the Safety of the City; and tho they were of Opinion, that it was highly proper and nece&s;&s;ary that a Proclamation &s;hould be i&s;&s;ued by the Go|vernment, promi&s;ing proper Rewards to &s;uch Per&s;on and Per&s;ons as &s;hould make &s;uch Di&s;covery of the Incendiaties, their Confederates and Accomplices, as that they &s;hould be convicted thereof; <HI>Yet it was well known that the Governor and Council had not the Liberty of drawing upon the Colony Trea&s;urer for any Sum of Money what&s;oever, upon any Emer|gency:</HI> And it could not be rea&s;onably expected the Governor &s;hould &s;ubject him&s;elf to pay &s;uch Rewards out of his own Pocket, for the U&s;e and Nece&s;&s;ities of the Publick; that as the Safety of the City, &s;o immediately concerned, &s;eemed ab&s;olutely to require &s;uch a Mea&s;ure to be taken; &s;o the Publick, who were al&s;o intere&s;ted in the Pre&s;ervation of it, would reap the Benefit in common with them, by the Cor|porations laudible Re&s;olution, &s;hould they determine to en|gage to pay proper Rewards, and reque&s;t the Governor to i&s;&s;ue a Proclamation agreeable thereto; which, he was per|&s;uaded, the Governor was well inclined to do, and the Gen|tlemen of the Council to advi&s;e thereto; <HI>He therefore moved,</HI> <Q>That the Board &s;hould come to a Re&s;olution to pay &s;uch Rewards as &s;hould by them be thought a proper and &s;uf|ficient Temptation to induce any Party or Parties con|cerned to make &s;uch Di&s;covery.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Upon Con&s;ideration whereof, it was</HI> <Q><HI>Ordered,</HI> That this Board reque&s;t his Honour the Lieutenant-Governor to i&s;&s;ue a Proclamation, offering a Reward to any white Per&s;on that &s;hould di&s;cover any Per&s;on or Per&s;ons lately concerned in &s;etting Fire to any Dwelling Hou&s;e or Storehou&s;e in this City (&s;o that &s;uch Per&s;on or Per&s;ons be convicted thereof,) The <HI>Sum of One Hundred Pounds,</HI> Current Money of this Province; and that &s;uch Per&s;on &s;hall be pardoned, if concerned therein: And any Slave that &s;hould make Di&s;covery, to be ma|numitted, or made free; and the Ma&s;ter of &s;uch Slave to receive <HI>Twenty-Five Pounds</HI> therefore; and the Slave to receive, be&s;ides his Freedom, the Sum of <HI>Twenty Pounds,</HI> and to be pardoned; and if a Free Negro, Mulatto, or Indian, to receive <HI>Forty-Five Pounds,</HI> and al&s;o to be pardoned, if concerned therein: And that this Board will i&s;&s;ue their Warrant to the Chamberlain, or Trea&s;urer of this Corporation for the Payment of &s;uch Sum as any Per&s;on by Vertue of &s;uch Proclamation &s;hall be intitled unto. And that the Mayor and Recorder wait on his Honour the Lieutenant-Governor, and acquaint him with the Re&s;olution of this Board.</Q></P>
<P>The Mayor and Recorder waited on His Honour accordingly, and a Copy of the Order was al&s;o delivered to him.</P>
<P>Many Per&s;ons in the Neighbourhood of the &s;everal Fires beforementioned, thought it nece&s;&s;ary to remove their Hou&s;hold Goods for Safety; and in their Con&s;ternation, as was natural, &s;uffered any Body who offered their A&s;&s;i&s;tance, to take them away; by which Means, &s;ome Villians had the Cruelty to make Prey of them; for there were great Complaints of Lo&s;&s;es upon tho&s;e Occa&s;ions, which the Ma|gi&s;trates took this Day into their Con&s;ideration. And it being much &s;u&s;pected that there were &s;ome Strangers lurking about the City, who had been the wicked In&s;truments and Occa|&s;ion of the&s;e Fires; but upon the Suppo&s;ition only, that by tho&s;e Means, they might have Opportunities of Pilfering and Plundering. A Scheme was propo&s;ed, that there &s;hould be a general Search of all Hou&s;es throughout the Town, whereby it was thought probable Di&s;coveries might be made, not only of &s;tolen Goods, but likewi&s;e of Lodgers,
<PB N="10" REF="005413_0017_1017394E60AF10C0">
that were Strangers, and &s;u&s;picious Per&s;ons: The Propo&s;al was approved of, and each Alderman and his Common Council-Man, with Con&s;tables attending them, undertook to &s;earch his re&s;pective Ward on the South Side of the Fre&s;h Water Pond; and the Monday following was the Day fixed upon for making the Experiment.</P>
<P>The Scheme was communicated to the Governor, and his Honour thought fit to Order the Militia out that Day in Aid of the Magi&s;trates, who were to be di&s;per&s;ed through the City, and Centries of them po&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ed at the Ends of the Streets to guard all Avenues, with Orders of &s;top all &s;u&s;|pected Per&s;ons that &s;hould be ob&s;erved carrying Baggs or Bundles, or removing Goods from Hou&s;e to Hou&s;e, in order for their Examination; and all this was to be kept very Secret till the Project was putting in Execution.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="day">
<HEAD>MONDAY, 13th APRIL.</HEAD>
<P>PURSUANT to the Scheme concerted on Saturday la&s;t, the <HI>general Search</HI> was made; but there were not any Goods di&s;covered which were &s;aid to have been lo&s;t, nor was there any &s;trange Lodger of &s;u&s;picious Per&s;ons detected: But <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Things were found in the Cu&s;tody of <HI>Robin,</HI> Mr. <HI>Chambers'</HI>s Negro, and <HI>Cuba</HI> his Wife, which the Alder|man thought improper for, and unbecoming the Condition of Slave<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&punc; which made him &s;u&s;pect they were not come ho|ne&s;tly by; and therefore ordered the Con&s;table to take them in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, to be re&s;erved for further Enquiry: And the&s;e two Negroes were committed.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="day">
<HEAD>FRIDAY, 17th APRIL.</HEAD>
<P>THE Lieutenant-Governor, by and with the Advice of his Maje&s;ty's Council, i&s;&s;ued a Proclamation, therein reciting the beforementioned Order and Re&s;olution of the Common Council, promi&s;ing the Rewards agreeable thereto.</P>
<P>In the mean whiile, between the Sixth and the Seven|teenth In&s;tant, a great deal of Time had been &s;pent by the Magi&s;trates in the Examination of the Negroes in Cu&s;tody, upon Account of the&s;e Fires, but nothing could be got out of them.</P>
<P><HI>Cuff</HI> (PHILIPSE's) was clo&s;ely interrogated, but he ab|&s;olutely denied knowing any thing of the Matter; he &s;aid he had been at home all that Afternoon, from the Time he returned from <HI>Hilton'</HI>s Fire, where he had been to a&s;&s;i&s;t and carry Buckets: That he was at home when the Bell rung for the Fire at Col. <HI>Philip&s;e'</HI>s Storehou&s;e. It appeared, upon Enquiry and Examination of Witne&s;&s;es, that he, ac|cording to his Ma&s;ter&punc;s Orders, had been &s;awing Wood that Afternon with a white Boy; and that when his Ma&s;ter came home from Dinner, he took him off from that Work, and &s;et him to &s;ew on a Vane upon a Board for his Sloop; the white Boy te&s;tified, <Q>That he &s;tood by him to &s;ee him &s;ew it, and that he left him but a little before the Bell rung for the Fire:</Q> And when the Alarm of the Fire was, and that 'twas &s;uppos'd to be at his Ma&s;ter's Storehou&s;e, it was &s;aid, <HI>Cuff</HI> was a&s;ked whether he would go out with the Buckets, and that he &s;hould an&s;wer, <HI>he had enough of being out in the Morning.</HI> Some of the Neighbours al&s;o de|clared that they had &s;een him looking over his Ma&s;ter's Door but a little before the Bell rung: But an old Man who had known <HI>Cuffee</HI> for &s;everal Years, depo&s;ed, that he had &s;een him at the Fire at the Storehou&s;e, and that he &s;tood next him: There &s;eemed to be &s;ome Objection again&s;t the Man's Evidence; 'twas thought he might be Mi&s;taken, being very near-&s;ighted; Upon Examination, 'twas found he could di&s;tingui&s;h Colours, and he de&s;cribed the Clothes he had on, and moreover declared, he &s;poke to him, and a&s;ked him, why he did not hand the Buckets; and that thereupon he an&s;wered him, and did hand Water, and that he knew his Voice.</P>
<P>There was very &s;trong Proof that he was the Negro that leaped out of the Window of one of the Storehou&s;es as the Fire was extingui&s;hed, and mo&s;t of the People drawn away upon the new Alarm of a Fire; that he was &s;een to leap over &s;everal Garden Fences, and to run home in great Ha&s;te.</P>
<P>Upon the Whole, 'twas thought proper <HI>Cuff</HI> &s;hould re|main in Confinement, to await further Di&s;covery.</P>

<P>Mr. Ju&s;tice PHILLIPSE gave the Charge to the <HI>Grand Jury</HI> as followeth.</P>
<Q><P><HI>Gentlemen of the Grand Jury,</HI></P>
<P>IT is not without &s;ome Concern, that I am obliged at this Time to be more particular in your Charge than for many preceeding Terms there hath been Occa&s;ion. Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> many Frights and Terrors which the good People of this City have of late been put into, by repeated and unu&s;ual Fires, and burning of Hou&s;es, give us too much Room to &s;u&s;pect, that &s;ome of them at lea&s;t did not pro|ceed from meer Chance or common Accidents; but on the Contrary, from the premeditated Malice and wicked Purpo&s;es of evil and de&s;igning Per&s;ons; and therefore it greatly behoves us to u&s;e our utmo&s;t Diligence by all lawful Ways and Means to di&s;cover the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> and Perpetrators of &s;uch daring and flagitious Under<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ings: That, upon Conviction, they may receive condign Pu|ni&s;hment: For although we have the Happine&s;s of living under a Government which exceeds all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> the Excellency of it's Con&s;titution and I am&punc; you if tho&s;e to whom the Execution of them (which <HI>My <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> COKE calls the Life and Soul of the Law) is committed, do not exert them&s;elves in a con&s;cientious Di&s;charge of their re&s;pective Duties; &s;uch Laws which were intended for a Terror to the Evil Doer, and a Protection to the Good, will become a dead Letter, and our mo&s;t excellent Con&s;titution turned into Anarchy and Confu&s;ion; every one practi&s;ing what he li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">teth; and doing what &s;hall &s;eem good in his own Eyes: To prevent which, it is the Duty of all Grand Juries to enquire into the Conduct and Behaviour of the People in their re&s;pective Counties; and if, upon Examination, they find any to have tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ed the Laws of the Land, to pre&s;ent them, that &s;o they may by the Court be put upon their Tryal, and then either to be di&s;charged or puni&s;hed according to their Demerits.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="005413_0019_10173956B6937750">
I am told there are &s;everal Pri&s;oners now in Goal, who have been committed by the City Magi&s;trates, upon Su&s;picion of having been concerned in &s;ome of the late Fires; and others, who under Pretence of a&s;&s;i&s;ting the unhappy Sufferers, by &s;aving their Goods from the Flames, for &s;tealing, or receiving the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">: This indeed is adding Affliction to the Afflicted, and is a very great Aggravation of &s;uch Crime, and therefore de&s;erves a nar|row Inquiry; that &s;o the exemplary Puni&s;hment of the Guilty (if any &s;uch &s;hould be &s;o found) may deter others from committing the like Villanie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&punc; for this kind of Stealing, I think, has not been often practi&s;ed among us.</P>
<P><HI>Gentlemen,</HI></P>
<P>ARSON, or the malicious and voluntary Burning, not only a Man&s;ion Hou&s;e, but al&s;o any other Hou&s;e, and the Out-Buildings, or Barns, and Stables adjoining thereto, by Night or by Day, is Felony at Common Law; and if any Part of the Hou&s;e be burnt, the Offender is guilty of Felony, notwith&s;tanding the Fire afterwards be put outs or go out of it&s;elf.</P>
<P>This Crime is of &s;o &s;hocking a Nature. that if we have any in this City, who, having been guilty thereof, &s;hould e&s;cape, who can &s;ay he is &s;afe, or tell where it will end?</P>
<P><HI>Gentlemen,</HI></P>
<P>Another Thing which I cannot omit recommending to your &s;erious and diligent Enquiry, is to find out and pre|&s;ent all &s;uch Per&s;ons who &s;ell Rum, and other &s;trong Li|quor to Negroes: It mu&s;t be obvious to every one, that there are too many of them in this City; who under Pretence of &s;elling what they call a Penny Dram to a Negro, will &s;ell to him as many Quarts or Gallons of Rum, as he can &s;teal Money or Goods to pay for.</P>
<P>How this Notion of its being lawful to &s;ell a Penny Dram, or a Pennyworth of Rum to a Slave, without the Con&s;ent or Direction of his Ma&s;ter, has prevailed, I know not; but this I am &s;ure of, that there is not only no &s;uch Law; but that the doing of it is directly contrary to an Act of A&s;&s;embly now in Force, <HI>for the better Regulating of Slaves.</HI> The many fatal Con&s;equences flowing from this prevailing and wicked Practice are &s;o notorious, and &s;o nearly con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">n us all, that one would almo&s;t be &s;urpri|zed, to think there &s;hould be a Nece&s;&s;ity for a Court to recommend the Surpre&s;&s;ing of &s;uch Pernicious Hou&s;es: Thus much in Particular; now in General,</P>
<P><HI>My <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">arge, Gentlemen,</HI> further is, to prevent all Con&s;piracies, Combinations, and other Offences, from Trea&s;ons down to Tre&s;pa&s;&s;es; and in your Enquiries, the Oath you, and each of you have ju&s;t now taken, will, I am per&s;uaded, be your Guide and I pray God to direct and a&s;&s;i&s;t you in the Di&s;charge of your Duty.</P></Q>

<HEAD>Supreme Court. WEDNESDAY, 22d APRIL.</HEAD>
<P>PRESENT. The Second Ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>The Court opened, and adjourned till Ten o'Clock To-morrow Morning.</P>
<P>THE Grand Jury having been informed, That <HI>Mary Burton</HI> could give them &s;ome Account concerning the Goods &s;tolen from Mr. <HI>Hogg'</HI>s; &s;ent for her this Morning, <HI>and ordered &s;he &s;hould be &s;worn;</HI> the Con&s;table returned and acquainted them, that <HI>&s;he &s;aid &s;he would not be &s;worn, nor give Evidence:</HI> Whereupon they ordered the Con&s;table to get a Warrant from a Magi&s;trate to bring her before them. The Con&s;table was &s;ome time gone, but at length returned, and brought her with him; and being a&s;ked <HI>why &s;he would not be &s;worn, and give her Evidence?</HI> She told the Grand Jury <HI>&s;he would not be &s;worn;</HI> and &s;eemed to be under &s;ome great Unea&s;ine&s;s, or terrible Apprehen&s;ions; which gave Su&s;picion that &s;he knew &s;omething concerning the Fires that had lately happened: And being a&s;k'd a Que&s;tion to that Purpo&s;e, <HI>&s;he gave no An&s;wer;</HI> which increa&s;ed the Jea|lou&s;y that &s;he was Privy to them: And as it was thought a Matter of the utmo&s;t Concern, the Grand Jury was very importunate, and u&s;ed many Arguments with her, in pub|lick, and private, to per&s;uade her to &s;peak the Truth, and tell all &s;he knew about it. To this End, the Lieutenant Governor's Proclamation was read to her, promi&s;ing In|demnity, and the Reward of <HI>One Hundred Pounds</HI> to any Per&s;on, Confederate or not, who &s;hould make Di&s;covery, <HI>&amp;c. She &s;eemed to de&s;pi&s;e it,</HI> nor could the Grand Jury by any Means, either Threats or Promi&s;es, prevail upon her, though they a&s;&s;ured her withal, that &s;he &s;hould have the Protection of the Magi&s;trates, and her Per&s;on be &s;afe and &s;ecure from harm; but hitherto all was in vain: Therefore the Grand Jury de&s;ired Alderman <HI>Banker</HI> to commit her; and the Con&s;table was charged with her accordingly; but before he had got her to the Jail, &s;he con&s;idered better of i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, and re&s;olved to be &s;worn, and give her Evidence in the Afternoon.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="005413_0020_10173958A777F160">
Accordingly, &s;he <HI>being &s;worn,</HI> came before the Grand Jury; but as they were proceeding to her Examination, and <HI>before they a&s;ked her any Que&s;tions,</HI> &s;he told them &s;he would acquaint them with what &s;he knew relating to the Goods &s;tolen from Mr. <HI>Hogg'</HI>s, <HI>but would &s;ay nothing about the Fires.</HI></P>
<P>This Expre&s;&s;ion thus, as it were Providentially, &s;lipping from the Evidence, much alarmed the Grand Jury; for, as they naturally concluded, it did by Con&s;truction amount to an Affirmative, that &s;he could give an Account of the Occa&s;ion of the &s;everal Fires; and-therefore, as it highly became tho&s;e Gentlemen in the Di&s;charge of their Tru&s;t, they determined to u&s;e their utmo&s;t Diligence to &s;ift out the Di&s;covery.</P>
<P>But &s;till &s;he remained inflexible; till at length, having recour&s;e to Religious Topicks, repre&s;enting to her the Hei|niou&s;ne&s;s of the Crime which &s;he would be guilty of, if &s;he was privy to, and could di&s;cover, &s;o wicked a De&s;ign, as the Firing Hou&s;es about our Ears; whereby not only Peo|ple's E&s;tates would be de&s;troyed, but many Per&s;ons might loo&s;e their Lives in the Flames: This &s;he would have to an&s;wer for at the Day of Judgment, as much as any Per&s;on immediately concerned; becau&s;e &s;he might have prevented this Di&s;truction, and would not; &s;o that a mo&s;t damnable Sin would lie at her Door; and what need &s;he fear from her divulging it; &s;he was &s;ure of the Protection of the Magi|&s;trates? Or the Grand Jury expre&s;&s;ed them&s;elves in Words to the &s;ame Purpo&s;e; which Arguments at la&s;t prevailed, and &s;he gave the following Evidence: Which, however, notwith&s;tanding what had been &s;aid, came from her, as if &s;till under &s;ome terrible Apprehen&s;ions or Re&s;traints.</P>

<P>PRESENT, The Second and Third Ju&s;tices.</P>
<P>The KING, <HI>again&s;t</HI> Cae&s;ar <HI>and</HI> Prince, <HI>Negroes.</HI></P>
<P>THE Pri&s;oners having been capitally convicted on two &s;everal Indictments for Felony, and being brought to the Bar, the Court proceeded to give Sentence; which was pa&s;s'd by the Second Ju&s;tice, as followeth.</P>
<Q><P>YOU <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> and <HI>Prince,</HI> the Grand Jury having found two Indictments again&s;t each of you, for felo|niou&s;ly &s;tealing and taking away from Mr. <HI>Hogg,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Meyers Coh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">,</HI> &s;undry Goods of con&s;iderable Value; to the&s;e Indictments you &s;everally pleaded, <HI>Not Guilty;</HI> and for your Trials, put your&s;elves upon God and the Country: Which Country having found you Guilty; it now only remains for the Court to pronounce that Judg|ment which the Law requires, and the Nature of your Crimes de&s;erve.</P>
<P>But before I proceed to Sentence, I mu&s;t tell you, that you have been proceeded again&s;t in the &s;ame Man|ner as any white Man, guilty of your Crimes would have been: You had not only the Liberty of &s;ending for your Witne&s;&s;es; a&s;king them &s;uch Que&s;tions as you thought proper; but likewi&s;e making the be&s;t Defence you could; and as you have been convicted by twelve hone&s;t Men upon their Oaths; &s;o the ju&s;t Judgment of GOD has at length overtaken you.</P>
<P>I have great Rea&s;on to believe, that the Crimes you now &s;tand convicted of, are not the lea&s;t of tho&s;e you have been concerned in; for by your general Characters you have been very wicked Fellows, hardened Sinners, and ripe, as well as ready, for the mo&s;t enormous and
<PB N="21" REF="005413_0028_10173974F693D8F8">
daring Enterprizes; e&s;pecially you, <HI>Cae&s;ar:</HI> And as the Time you have yet to live is to be but very &s;hort, I earne&s;tly advi&s;e and exhort both of you to employ it in the mo&s;t diligent and be&s;t Manner you can, by confe&s;&s;ing your Sins, repenting &s;incerely of them, and praying GOD of his infinite Goodne&s;s to have Mercy on your Souls: And as GOD knows the Secrets of your Hearts, and cannot be cheated or impo&s;ed upon; &s;o you mu&s;t &s;hortly give an Account to him, and an&s;wer for all your Actions; and depend upon it, if you do not truly repent before you die, there is a Hell to puni&s;h the Wicked eternally.</P>
<P>And as it is not in your Powers to make full Re&s;titu|tion for the many Injuries you have done the Publick; &s;o I advi&s;e both of you to do all that in you is, to prevent <HI>further Mi&s;chiefs;</HI> by di&s;covering &s;uch Per&s;ons as have been concerned with you in de&s;igning or endeavouring to burn this City, and to de&s;troy its Inhabitants: This I am fully per&s;uaded is in your Power to do if you will; if &s;o, and you do not make &s;uch Di&s;covery; be a&s;&s;ured God Almighty will puni&s;h you for it, though we do not: Therefore I advi&s;e you to con&s;ider this well, and I hope both of you will tell the Truth.</P>
<P>And now, Nothing further remains for me to &s;ay; but</P>
<P>THAT you <HI>Cae&s;ar,</HI> and you <HI>Prince,</HI> are to be taken hence to the Place from whence you came, and from thence to the Place of Execution, and there you, and each of you, are to be hanged by the Neck until you be dead.</P>
<P>And I pray the Lord to have Mercy on your Souls.</P></Q>
<P><HI>Ordered,</HI> That their Execution be on <HI>Monday</HI> next, the Eleventh Day of this In&s;tant, between the Hours of Nine and One of the &s;ame Day.</P>
<P>And further <HI>Ordered,</HI> That after the Execution of the &s;aid Sentence, the Body of <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> be hung in Chains.</P>
<P>Court adjourned till <HI>Monday</HI> Morning next Ten o'Clock.</P>
<P><HI>PEGGY</HI> was examined by the Judges touching the Matter of her Confe&s;&s;ion delivered in Writing la&s;t Night, which &s;he declared for Truth; and for the greater Solemnity was &s;worn to it, after having been &s;eriou&s;ly ad|moni&s;hed not to dare to &s;ay any Thing but the Truth, or to accu&s;e innocent Per&s;ons: She was told, that we had dived &s;o far into this My&s;tery of Iniquity already, that we could ea&s;ily di&s;cern whether &s;he prevaricated or not; and that if &s;he did, &s;he mu&s;t not flatter her&s;elf with he Hopes of being recommended to Mercy; &s;o that &s;uch di&s;ingenuous Behaviour would but deceive her&s;elf, and make her Ca&s;e de&s;perate; or in Words to that Purpo&s;e: She put on the Air of Sincerity, as if di&s;po&s;ed to make a Di&s;covery; but &s;eemed to be under terrible Apprehen&s;ions. What &s;he &s;aid, corre&s;ponded with the Scheme of the Plot &s;o far as we had got Light into it, and in a great Mea&s;ure confirmed what <HI>Arthur Price</HI> &s;aid in his Depo&s;ition, NUMB.

<P>At this Examination, &s;he related a great many Particulars, which for want of Time were not committed to Writing; but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> further Examination deferred to the next Day.</P>
<P><HI>Romme</HI> at this Time ab&s;conded; Orders having been given for apprehending him long before, upon Su&s;picion of his having received &s;ome of the Goods &s;tolen from Mr. <HI>Hogg'</HI>s; and <HI>Peggy</HI> and her Advi&s;ers might think as he was out of reach, &s;he might &s;afely &s;hift the Scene to his Hou&s;e: Or this bloody Scheme might have been brooding at both Places, and with her Knowledge; but one may be per|&s;uaded from the Cour&s;e of the Evidence, that <HI>Romme</HI> was apprized at lea&s;t of the Con&s;piracy carrying on at <HI>Hugh&s;on'</HI>s.</P>

<P>For the greater Solemnity of the Matter, <HI>Peggy</HI> al&s;o &s;wore to and &s;igned her three &s;everal Examinations.</P>
<P>This Hi&s;tory of <HI>Peggy'</HI>s contained in her three Exami|nations corre&s;ponds &s;o exactly as to the Per&s;ons of, and Charge again&s;t, &s;uch Negroes (mentioned by others) which &s;he brings in Que&s;tion; and al&s;o with the Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ter and Circum&s;tances of the Con&s;piracy, which the Reader may hereafter perceive from the whole Current of Depo&s;itions and Examinations of Whites and Blacks; that one may be very apt to conclude, &s;he only &s;hifted the Scene and laid it in a wrong Place.</P>
<P><HI>Peggy</HI> very well knew that <HI>Romme</HI> had fled the Country upon the Enquiry about the Robbery at <HI>Hogg'</HI>s; and pro|bably that, finding her own Life in Jeopardy concern|ing that Felony, as well as the Con&s;piracy, which &s;he now was &s;en&s;ible had got Air, and was like to be detected <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> and partly by her own frank Talk and Openne&s;s with her Fellow Pri&s;oner <HI>Price;</HI> &s;he therefore might think it high Time to provide for her own Safety, if &s;he could do it &s;o cheap as by amu&s;ing us with a Narrative of the Plot; which, though real and true in other <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, neverthele&s;s &s;he charged the Confederacy and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> about it to have been held &s;olely at <HI>Romme'</HI>s, us to the Knowledge &s;he had concerning it; and &s;o &s;creen'd the other Confederates. <HI>Hugh&s;on, his Wife and Family,</HI> at who&s;e Hou&s;e principally the&s;e Mi&s;creants a&s;&s;ociated; though what &s;he declared might be true as to both Places, and there &s;eems to be too much Rea&s;on to mi&s;tru&s;t it was &s;o; yet the ab&s;olutely denied to the la&s;t, that &s;he had ever heard any &s;uch Di&s;cour&s;e at <HI>Hugh&s;on'</HI>s, though frequently interrogated very &s;trictly to that Purpo&s;e, and admoni&s;hed in the mo&s;t &s;olemn Manner to declare the whole Truth, if &s;he intended to do her&s;elf any Service, or induce the Judges to recommend her as an Object de&s;erving of Mercy.</P>
<P>However, though there was little Rea&s;on to think that <HI>Peggy</HI> had told all that &s;he knew of the Matter: yet that what &s;he had &s;aid was, in the main, true, there &s;eemed no Doubt, as &s;aid before, from the Corre&s;pondence between her Story and that of the other Evidences, &s;o far as they had di&s;covered with relation to the Con&s;piracy&punc; the only Que&s;tion was, Whether it was carried on at <HI>Romme's, </HI> as well as <HI>Hugh&s;on'</HI>s? From her lodging and Intimacy with the <HI>Hugh&s;on'</HI>s, &s;he might be inclined to favour them, and lay the Scene at <HI>Romme'</HI>s only, who was then thought to be out of reach; and &s;o make Merit of a fallacious Sort of Di&s;covery. But we had great Hopes, that if &s;he &s;hould be convicted upon the Indictment for the Con&s;piracy, &s;he would come to a Re&s;olution to make an ingenuous Con|fe&s;&s;ion in order to &s;ave her&s;elf: And with this Expectation, and con&s;idering what &s;he had confe&s;&s;ed already, the Judges were induced to recommend her to the Lieutenant Governor for a Pardon, on this Condition neverthele&s;s, that it &s;hould not pa&s;s the Seal till &s;he &s;hould be thought amply to have merited it.</P>
<P>And a Pardon was accordingly prepared for her, ready to pa&s;s the Seal when it &s;hould be &s;ent for by the Judges.</P>

<Q><P><HI>May it plea&s;e your Honours, and you Gentlemen of the Jury:</HI></P>
<P>THIS is a Cau&s;e of very great Expectation; it being as I conceive, a Matter of the utmo&s;t Importance that ever yet came to be tried in this Province; where|fore, before I call the Witne&s;&s;es to prove the&s;e two Negroes guilty, I &s;hall briefly mention to you &s;omething concerning this My&s;tery of Iniquity in general, how and where it was formed and carried on, and what Share the&s;e two Criminals had in it.</P>
<P><HI>Gentlemen,</HI></P>
<P>Not only the&s;e two Negroes, but divers others, and &s;everal white People, as will appear to you in the Cour&s;e of our Evidence, have been concerned with the&s;e wretched Offenders, in this mo&s;t wicked and devili&s;h Con&s;piracy.</P>
<P><HI>Gentlemen,</HI></P>
<P>You will hear from the Mouths of our Witne&s;&s;es, that the&s;e two Negroes with divers others, frequently met at the Hou&s;e of one <HI>John Hugh&s;on,</HI> in this City:&mdash;It was there they were harboured:&mdash;<HI>There</HI> was the Place of their general Rendezvous; and <HI>there</HI> it was this helli&s;h Con|&s;piracy was brooded, formed, con&s;ented and agreed to:&mdash;It was <HI>there</HI> that the&s;e two Negroes, and the Re&s;t of the Con&s;pirators, came to a Re&s;olution of <HI>burning the King's Hou&s;e at the Fort, and this whole Town; and of murdering the Inhabitnats</HI> as they &s;hould come to extin|gui&s;h the Flames.&mdash;CRIMES, <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> &s;o a&s;toni&s;h|ingly cruel and dete&s;table; that one would think they could never have entered into the Minds, much le&s;s the Re&s;olution, of any <HI>but a Conclave of Devils</HI> to execute; and yet &s;uch Mon&s;ters in Iniquity are the&s;e two Criminals and the Re&s;t of their Confederates.</P>
<P><HI>Gentlemen,</HI></P>
<P>It will likewi&s;e appear to you, by <HI>Quack'</HI>s own Con|fe&s;&s;ion (as we &s;hall in the Cour&s;e of our Evidence for the King upon thir Trial &s;hew you) That, in Pro&s;ecution of &s;uch their mo&s;t abominable Con&s;piracies, the King's Hou&s;e was by him (at the In&s;tigation of the Re&s;t of the Con&s;pirators) &s;et on Fire, burnt down, and con&s;umed.</P>
<P>And then as to <HI>Cuffee,</HI> we &s;hall &s;hew <HI>You,</HI> that he is doubtle&s;s Guilty of the Charge again&s;t him.</P>
<P><HI>Gentlemen,</HI></P>
<P>The Eyes of the Inhabitants of this City and Province are upon <HI>You,</HI> relying on, and confiding in <HI>You;</HI> that by the Ju&s;tice of your Verdict in this Cau&s;e this Day, the Peace and Safety of this City and Province may for the Future be &s;ecured to them; which at pre&s;ent (until &s;ome Examples are made) &s;eem very precarious.</P>

<P>It is in <HI>You,</HI> the People in general, place their Hopes and Expectations of their future Security and Repo&s;e; that they may &s;it &s;ecurely in their own Hou&s;es, and re&s;t quietly in their Beds, no one daring to make them afraid.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now proceed to examine the Witne&s;&s;es for the King, to &s;upport the Charge again&s;t each of the&s;e Cri|minals&punc; and can make no doubt, <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> but when you have heard the Evidence again&s;t them, you will for your own Sakes, your Oaths Sake, and for the Peace, Quiet, and Security of your Country, find the&s;e two Negroes Guilty.</P></Q>

<P>Mr. <HI>Smith</HI> then proceeded to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> up and remark upon the Evidence, and &s;poke as followeth.</P>
<Q><P><HI>May it plea&s;e your Honours, and you Gentlemen of the Jury&punc;</HI></P>
<P>THE Part a&s;&s;igned to me on this Trial, is to &s;um up the Evidence which you have heard: And in general it may be ob&s;erved, that a mo&s;t horrid Con&s;pi|racy has been formed, <HI>to burn this City, and to de&s;troy the White People.</HI></P>
<P>That great Numbers of Per&s;ons have been concerned <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Plot; &s;ome <HI>Whites,</HI> and many <HI>Blacks,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> the Place of their general Rendezvous was the Hou&s;e of <HI>John Hugh&s;on.</HI> That there Thirty Negroes have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> at a Time. That their Meetings were chiefly on Sundays. That <HI>Hugh&s;on,</HI> as the Captain of this HELLISH BAND, &s;wore him&s;elf and others into this Dark Confederacy. That &s;ome Arms and Ammunition were provided by <HI>Hugh&s;on</HI> for the Purpo&s;e. And that the Night Sea&s;on was agreed on for the putting it in Execution.</P>
<P><HI>Gentlemen,</HI></P>
<P>No Scheme more mon&s;trous could have been invented; nor can any Thing be thought of more fooli&s;h, than the Motives that induced the&s;e Wretches to enter into it! What more ridiculous, than that <HI>Hugh&s;on</HI> in Con&s;equence of this Scheme, &s;hould become a <HI>King! Cae&s;ar</HI> (now in Gibbets a <HI>Governor!</HI> That the White Men &s;hould be all killed, and the Women become a Prey to the rapacious Lu&s;t of the&s;e Villains! That the&s;e Slaves &s;hould thereby e&s;tabli&s;h them&s;elves in Peace and Freedom in the plunder'd Wealth of their &s;laughter'd Ma&s;ters! 'Tis hard to &s;ay whether <HI>the Wickedne&s;s</HI> or <HI>the Folly</HI> of this De&s;ign is the Greater: And had it not been in Part executed before it was di&s;covered; we &s;hould with great Difficulty have been per&s;uaded to believe it po&s;&s;ible, that &s;uch a <HI>wicked</HI> and <HI>fooli&s;h Plot</HI> could be contrived by any Creatures in Human Shape.</P>
<P>Yet, <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> INCREC<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">BLE as &s;uch a Plot would have &s;eemed to have been, the Event has in Part proved it to be REAL. Whence el&s;e could &s;o many Fires have been lighted up all around you in &s;o &s;hort a Time, with evident Marks of wilful De&s;ign? A De&s;ign that could not be executed but by &s;everal Hands.</P>
<P>Now, <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> the Pri&s;oners at the Bar &s;tand charged with being principal Parties in this TRAGICAL DESIGN, and two of the prime Incendiaries; <HI>Quack</HI> for <HI>burning his Maje&s;ty's Hou&s;e in the Fort,</HI> and <HI>Cuffee</HI> for <HI>burning Col.</HI> Philip&s;e'<HI>s Storehou&s;e.</HI></P></Q>
<P><PB N="43" REF="005413_0050_101739B9ED6E10E0">
Afterwards Mr. <HI>Smith</HI> proceeded to ob&s;erve on the &s;everal Parts of the Evidence again&s;t each of the Pri&s;oners; particularly to &s;hew, that <HI>Cuffee</HI> was one of the fir&s;t of the Negroes that were &s;worn into the Plot to <HI>burn</HI> and <HI>murder;</HI> That he appeared one of the mo&s;t forward and active in promoting it; That Mr. <HI>Philip&s;e'</HI>s Storehou&s;e by diver&s;e Circum&s;tances appeared to have been wilfully &s;et on fire; That the Pri&s;oner declared that he would burn that Storehou&s;e; That he was &s;een there before the Fire broke out, in a &s;u&s;picious Appearance, and was pre&s;ent at the Time of it; and at the Cry of &s;ome Per&s;on, that Negroes were in the Storehou&s;e, the Pri&s;oner jumped out of a Window, leaped over two Fences and ran away, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> That he &s;eemed exceedingly well plea&s;ed with the Fire at the Fort; over&s;et the Buckets that were fill'd with Water, and did what he could to prevent the Extingui&s;hing of that Fire, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And then inferred from the Facts proved, and Circum&s;tances attending them, that there appeared <HI>violent Pre&s;umption</HI> of Guilt, which the Law e&s;teems FULL PROOF.</P>
<P>As to <HI>Quack</HI> he ob&s;erved, that the Witne&s;&s;es proved that <HI>Quack</HI> was &s;worn into the Con&s;piracy, and particularly that he had agreed to burn the Fort; that he repeatedly &s;aid he would do it; That the Fire where it broke out could not ea&s;ily be accounted for from any accidental Cau&s;e; That the Pri&s;oner had confe&s;&s;ed the Crime both before he was apprehended and &s;ince he had been in Jail: All which amount to FULL PROOF.</P>
<P>The particular Remarks on the Te&s;timony of the Wit|ne&s;&s;es to the &s;everal Points before mentioned, are here omitted for the Sake of Brevity, and becau&s;e the Sub&s;tance of the Evidence is before related.</P>
<P>Then concluded,</P>
<Q><P>Thus, <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> I have di&s;tingui&s;hed the &s;everal Points of the Evidence again&s;t the Pri&s;oners, and have repeated the Sub&s;tance of what each Witne&s;s has &s;aid to each Point, and &s;hall leave it to you to determine whether the Pri&s;oners are guilty or not. I have endea|voured to lay no more Weight upon any Part of the Evidence, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">n it will well bear; and I hope I have not urged any Con&s;equence which the Fact proved will not fairly warrant.</P>
<P><HI>Gentlemen,</HI> The Pri&s;oners have been indulged with the &s;ame Kind of Trial as is due to <HI>Freemen,</HI> though they might have been proceeded again&s;t in a more &s;ummary and le&s;s favourable Way. The Negro Evidence, in the Maner in which it has been produced, is warranted by the Act of A&s;&s;embly that has been read to you: The Law requires no Oath to be admini&s;tered to them; and indeed it would &s;eem to be a Profanation of it, to ad|mini&s;ter it to a Heathen in the legal Form. You have &s;een that the Court has put them under the mo&s;t &s;olemn Caution, that their &s;mall Knowledge of Religion can render them capable of.&mdash;The Being and Perfections of an ALMIGHTY, ALL KNOWING and JUST GOD, and the Terrors of an eternal World, have been plainly laid before them, and &s;trongly pre&s;&s;ed upon them. Unle&s;s they were profe&s;&s;ed Chri&s;tians, and had taken upon them the Bonds and Obligations of that Religion, <HI>their Word</HI> with the <HI>Cautions</HI> that have been u&s;ed, I &s;uppo&s;e will be thought by you, as &s;atisfactory as any Oath that could have been devi&s;ed, But, <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> the Court has no Power to admini&s;ter an Oath but in the common Form: And if Pagan Negroes could not be received as Witne&s;&s;es again&s;t each other&punc; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> legal Form; it is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> that the greate&s;t Villanies would often pa&s;s with Impunity.</P>
<P>Before I conclude, I can't help ob&s;erving to you, <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> that by divers Parts of the Evidence, it appears that this horrid <HI>Scene of Iniquity</HI> has been chiefly con|trived and promoted at Meetings of Negroes in great Numbers on <HI>Sundays.</HI> This in&s;tructive Circum&s;tance may teach US many Le&s;&s;ons both of Reproof and Caution; which I only hint at, and &s;hall leave the Deduction of the Particulars to every one's Reflection.</P>
<P><HI>Gentlemen,</HI></P>
<P>The mon&s;trous Ingratitude of this black Tribe, is what exceedingly aggravates their Guilt. Their Slavery among us is generally &s;oftned with great Indulgence. They live without Care; and are commonly better fed and cloathed, and put to le&s;s Labour, than the <HI>Poor</HI> of mo&s;t Chri&s;tian Countries. They are indeed <HI>Slaves,</HI> but under the Protection of the Law: None can hu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t them with Impunity. They are really more happy in this Place, than in the Mid&s;t of the continual Plunder, Cruelty and Rapine of their Native Countries: But Notwith|&s;tanding all the Kindne&s;s and Tenderne&s;s with which they have been treated among&s;t us; yet this is the &s;econd Attempt of the &s;ame Kind, that this bruti&s;h and bloody Species of Mankind have made within one Age.<NOTE N="(k)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Alluding to the Negro Plot in</HI> 1712, <HI>before noted upon</HI> Peggy'<HI>s Examination,</HI> NUMB.

<PB N="44" REF="005413_0051_101739BCEF4E4E48">
to all that had come after them: But I fear, <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> that we &s;hall never be quite &s;afe, 'til that wicked Race are under more Re&s;traint, or their Number greatly reduced within this City. But I &s;hall not in&s;i&s;t further, but refer you, <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> to the Direction of the Court; and if the Evidence again&s;t the&s;e Pri&s;oners proves &s;ufficient in your Judgment to convict them, I make no doubt but you will bring in a Verdict accordingly, and do what in you lies to rid this Country of &s;ome of the vile&s;t Creatures in it.</P></Q>
<P>Then the Jury were charged, and a Con&s;table was &s;worn to attend them as u&s;ual; and they withdrew; and being &s;oon returned, found the Pri&s;oners Guilty of both Indictments.</P>
<P>The Pri&s;oners were a&s;ked, What they had to offer in Arre&s;t of Judgment, why they &s;hould not receive Sentence of Death? And they offering nothing but Repetitions of Prote&s;tations of their Innocence;</P>
<P>The THIRD JUSTICE proceeded to Sentence, as fol|loweth.</P>

<P>Court. [to the Pri&s;oners] <HI>Have you any more Witne&s;&s;es? Hugh&s;on.</HI> We have no more, Sir.</P>
<P>Court. <HI>Then now is the Time for you the Pri&s;oners, &s;eve|rally to offer what you can in your own Defence, that then the Council for the King may &s;um up the Evidence.</HI></P>
<P>Then the Pri&s;oners &s;everally &s;poke in their Ju&s;tification in their Turns; prote&s;ted their Innocence, and declared that all the Witne&s;&s;es &s;aid again&s;t them was fal&s;e; and cal|led upon God to witne&s;s their A&s;&s;everations.</P>
<P>Mr. SMITH then proceeded as followeth.</P>
<Q><P><HI>May it plea&s;e your Honours, and you Gentlemen of the Jury;</HI></P>
<P>YOU have heard the Charge again&s;t the Pri&s;oners at the Bar contained in their &s;everal Indictments, to which they have each of them pleaded <HI>Not Guilty.</HI> Mr. Attorney has opened the Nature of the Evidence on the Part of the King, and the Witne&s;&s;es on both Sides have been heard, and I can't think that one among you is in any Doubt concerning what Verdict you ought to give upon the Oath which you have taken.</P>
<P><HI>Gentlemen,</HI></P>
<P>Scarce any Thing can be conceived more horrid than the Crimes charged on the Pri&s;oners. A Scheme &s;o black and helli&s;h, as <HI>the Burning of this City and the Murdering of the Inhabitants of it!</HI> One would hardly imagine could enter into the Thought, much le&s;s be har<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters">ed in the Brea&s;t of any human Creature; but more wonder|ful is it, that &s;o great a Number, &s;hould unite and con|&s;pire in &s;o dete&s;table a Piece of Villany: And yet, <HI>Gen|tlemen,</HI> there &s;eems Nothing wanting to compleat the Evidence that <HI>&s;o barbar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">us, unju&s;t and cruel a De&s;ign</HI> has been &s;et on foot; of which we have had in Part an oc|cular Demon&s;tration, in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> late Fires that have been en|kindled in diver&s;e Parts of this City; &s;everal of which have been lighted up in one Day, to the Amazement and Terror of the People.</P>
<P><HI>Gentlemen,</HI></P>
<P>Though the Circum&s;tances attending the&s;e Fires con|vinced every body that the Mo&s;t of them did not proceed from accidental Cau&s;es, but from a malicious and wilful De&s;ign; yet it was long before any con&s;iderable Di&s;|covery could be made, of the Authors and Abettors of this mo&s;t wicked and de&s;tructive Undertaking: Yet at length by the Ble&s;&s;ing of Heaven, and the uncommon Diligence of the Magi&s;trates, we tru&s;t that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the principal Authors of this Mi&s;chief, and the Ringleader of it, are now before you.</P></Q>
<P>Upon this Mr. <HI>Smith</HI> proceeded to a di&s;tinct Con&s;idera|tion of the Charge, and in ob&s;erving upon the Evidence of the Witne&s;&s;es (which was in Sub&s;tance as before &s;et forth) di&s;tingui&s;hed the Proofs again&s;t each of the Pri&s;oners; which for Brevity &s;ake are here omitted.</P>
<P>And then concluded,</P>
<Q><P>THUS, <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> nothing remains to be con&s;idered of by you, but the Credit of the Witne&s;&s;es; again&s;t which I can &s;ee no rea&s;onable Objection: If they are to be be|lieved, then the Pri&s;oners <HI>are Guilty;</HI> and you now be|hold, at this Bar, the Authors, Abettors, and Contrivers of tho&s;e de&s;tructive Fires which your Eyes have &s;een: Two of the immediate Agents of tho&s;e Villanies, have already &s;uffered a de&s;erved Puni&s;hment, and died con|fe&s;&s;ing their Crimes. The Witne&s;&s;es declare the prin|cipal Contriver of tho&s;e Mi&s;chiefs to be that wicked Man <HI>John Hugh&s;on,</HI> who&s;e Crimes have made him blacker than a Negro; the Scandal of his Complexion, and the Di&s;grace of human Nature! Who&s;e Name will de&s;cend with Infamy to Po&s;terity! Who could not be content to live by the Gains of an hone&s;t Indu&s;try; but mu&s;t be rich at the Expence of the Blood and Ruin of his fellow Citizens! Mi&s;erable Wretch! How has he plunged him|&s;elf and Family into that Pit which he has dug for others, and brought down upon his own Pate that violent Deal|ing which he contrived, and in Part executed again&s;t his Neighbours! <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> Though the Crimes charged on the Defendants are &s;uch as merit a ju&s;t Indignation; yet in Matters that affect Life, you ought to have the mo&s;t convincing Evidence: The Trial of the Fact is your Pro|vince. In Matters of Judgment to condemn the Innocent, and acquit the Guilty, is equally Criminal. If you can, after what you have heard, think the Pri&s;oners innocent, you ought to acquit them; but if you find them guilty, you cannot acquit them without the greate&s;t Inju&s;tice and Cruelty to your Country and your&s;elves. <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> I &s;hall add no more, but leave you to the Direction of the Court and your own Con&s;ciences.</P></Q>
<P>Then the Third Ju&s;tice charged the Jury as followeth.</P>
<Q><P><HI>Gentlemen of the Jury.</HI></P>
<P>'TIS needle&s;s for the Court to ob&s;erve further to you, after what has been &s;aid by the Council for the King, concerning the Nature and de&s;tructive Tendency of &s;o execrable a Piece of Villany, as this Con&s;piracy now charged upon the Pri&s;oners at the Bar: It has been
<PB N="59" REF="005413_0066_101739EEE5115970">
&s;ufficiently and properly enlarged upon; nor is it any more nece&s;&s;ary for the Court to recapitulate the Evidence given in the Ca&s;e; for that has been very clearly &s;tated, by the Gentlemen at the Bar.</P>
<P>Now,<HI>Gentlemen,</HI> if you cannot credit the &s;everal Witne&s;&s;es for the King, if that can be the Ca&s;e, you will then acquit the Pri&s;oners of this Charge again&s;t them, and find them not Guilty; but on the other Hand, as the Evidence again&s;t them &s;eems to be &s;o ample, &s;o full, &s;o clear, and &s;atisfactory, if you have no particular Rea|&s;ons in your own Brea&s;ts, in your own Con&s;ciencies, to di&s;credit them; if that, I &s;ay, is not the Ca&s;e,; if you have no Rea&s;on to di&s;credit them; then I make no doubt, but you will di&s;charge a good Con&s;cience, and find them Guilty.</P></Q>
<P>A Con&s;table being &s;worn to attend the Jury, they with|drew; and being returned in a &s;hort Time, found <HI>Hugh&s;on, his Wife,</HI> and <HI>Kerry,</HI> GUILTY of all three Indictments; and <HI>Sarah Hugh&s;on</HI> the Daughter, GUILTY of the Second and Third.</P>

<P>THE Pri&s;oners being called up to Judgment upon their Conviction for the Con&s;piracy, and placed at the Bar, the SECOND JUSTICE proceeded to pa&s;s Sentence, as followeth.</P>
<P>John Hugh&s;on, <HI>and you the re&s;t of the Pri&s;oners at the Bar.</HI></P>
<Q><P>YOU are now brought before this Court to receive that Sentence which the Law has appointed for your Offences; though I cannot <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ay the Puni&s;hment is adequate to the horrid Crimes of which you &s;tand con|victed. The <HI>Roman</HI> Common-Wealth was e&s;tabli&s;hed &s;ome hundred Years before any Law was made again&s;t Parricide; they not thinking any Per&s;on capable of &s;o atrocious a Crime: Yours are indeed as &s;ingular, and unheard of before; they are &s;uch as one would &s;carce believe any Man capable of committing, e&s;pecially any one who had heard of a God, and of a future State: For People who have been brought up, and always lived in a Chri&s;tian Country, and al&s;o called them&s;elves Chri|&s;tians, to be guilty not only of making Negro Slaves their Equals, but even their Superiors, by waiting upon, keeping with, and entertaining them, with Meat, Drink, and Lodging; and what is much more amazing, to plot, con&s;pire, con&s;ult, abet and encourage the&s;e black <HI>Seed of Cain,</HI> to burn this City, and to kill and de&s;troy us all.&mdash;GOOD GOD! When I reflect on the Di&s;orders, Confu&s;ion, De&s;olation and Havock, which the Effect of your mo&s;t wicked, mo&s;t dete&s;table and diabolical Councils might have produced (had not the Hand of our great and good God interpo&s;ed) it &s;hocks me! for you, who would have burnt and de&s;troyed without Mercy, ought to be &s;erved in a like Manner: And although each of you
<PB N="61" REF="005413_0068_101739F96634B360">
have, with an uncommon A&s;&s;urance, denied the Fact, and audaciou&s;ly called upon God as a Witne&s;s of your Innocence; yet it hath plea&s;ed him, out of his unboun|ded Goodne&s;s and Mercy to us, to confound your Devices, and cau&s;e your malicious and wicked Machinations and Intentions to be laid open and clear before us, not only to the Satisfaction and Conviction of the Court, the Grand and Petty Jury, but likewi&s;e to every one el&s;e that has heard the Evidence again&s;t you; all are &s;atisfied the ju&s;t Judgment of God has overtaken you, and that you ju&s;tly merit a more &s;evere Death than is intended for you, having, in my Opinion, been much wor&s;e than the Negroes: However, though your Crimes de|&s;erve it, yet we mu&s;t not act contrary to Law.</P>
<P>And now I do mo&s;t earne&s;tly exhort you, and each of you, to a &s;erious and diligent Improvement of the little Time you have yet to live on this Side of Eternity, duly and heartily to weigh and con&s;ider your pa&s;t wicked and ill-&s;pent Lives, by bewailing, confe&s;&s;ing and &s;incerely repenting of your Sins; that thereby you may obtain Mercy and Forgivene&s;s from our great and ju&s;t God; for without a &s;incere, as well as contrite Heart, you can neither expect Mercy or Forgivene&s;s for your manifold Offences, both again&s;t God and your Neighbours.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t now &s;peak particularly <HI>to you John Hugh&s;on,</HI> and <HI>to you Sarah Hugh&s;on:</HI> Look upon your poor unhappy Daughter, now &s;tanding by you, of whom you have been the mi&s;erable In&s;truments of bringing into the World; after that, to train, and bring her up in the School of the Devil, and now la&s;tly, to the Gallows.&mdash;I &s;ay, con&s;ider and &s;et her a good Example, in a Time when every Moment is precious to you, that the great Deceiver of Mankind, may not have the &s;ame Power over you all in the next World, as he &s;eems to have had in this,</P>
<P>I mu&s;t now proceed to the Duty the Law requires of me; which is to tell you,</P>
<P>That you, the Pri&s;oners now at the Bar, be removed to the Place from whence you came, and from thence to the Place of Execution, and there you, and each of you, are to be hanged by the Neck 'til you are &s;everally dead; and I pray God of his great Goodne&s;s, to have Mercy on your Souls.</P></Q>
<P><HI>Ordered,</HI> That the &s;aid condemned Pri&s;oners be executed on Friday the Twelfth of <HI>June</HI> In&s;tant, between the Hours of Nine and One of the &s;ame Day; and that the Body of <HI>John Hugh&s;on</HI> be afterwards hung in Chains.</P>

<Q><P><HI>Gentlemen,</HI></P>
<P>IT will&punc; I doubt not, appear to you, upon hearing our Witne&s;&s;es for the King on this Trial, that the&s;e &s;ix Negroes are &s;ome of the Con&s;pirators who combined with tho&s;e principal Incendiaries, <HI>Hugh&s;on</HI> and his Family, to &s;et on fire the King's Hou&s;e, and this whole Town, and to kill and murder the Inhabitants.</P>
<P>But as I have already, upon the Trial of the Negro <HI>Quack,</HI> for burning the King's Hou&s;e, and of another Negro called <HI>Cuffee,</HI> for burning Mr. <HI>Philip&s;e'</HI>s Storehou&s;e, and likewi&s;e on the la&s;t Trial of <HI>Hugh&s;on, his Wife and Daughter,</HI> and <HI>Kerry,</HI> endeavoured to &s;et forth th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> Heinou&s;ne&s;s of &s;o horrible and dete&s;table a Con&s;piracy; and the Dangers this City and Province may &s;till be expo&s;ed to, until Examples are made of all &s;uch as have been concerned in this mo&s;t wicked Plot; I think I have no Need upon this Trial, to &s;ay any Thing further on either of the&s;e Heads; not doubting but when you have heard the Crimes which the&s;e Criminals &s;tand charged with, proved again&s;t them, you will find them Guilty.</P></Q>

<P>IT will appear to you by the Evidence for the King upon this Trial, that the&s;e four Pri&s;oners at the Bar are &s;ome of that great Number of Negroes that frequently met at <HI>Hugh&s;on'</HI>s Hou&s;e; where he privately entertained them, and where they confederated with him, and the re&s;t of the Con&s;pirators, to carry on this mo&s;t wicked and dreadful Con&s;piracy to burn the King's Hou&s;e and this Town, and to murder the Inhabitants.&mdash;The mo&s;t horrible and de&s;tructive Plot that ever was yet known in the&s;e Northern Parts of <HI>America;</HI> of which <HI>Hugh&s;on</HI> was here the chief Contriver and Director, with great Expec|tations of enriching him&s;elf by the Ruin and De&s;truction of his Neighbours; as has been fully made appear on
<PB N="68" REF="005413_0076_10173A1514F4F1C8">
the preceeding Trials; wherefore it may ju&s;tly be called HUGHSON's PLOT.&mdash;It will likewi&s;e appear to you in Evidence, that each of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e Negro Pri&s;oners were &s;worn into this direful Con&s;piracy, and never to di&s;cover it, or that <HI>Hugh&s;on</HI> was any way concerned in it.</P>
<P><HI>Gentlemen,</HI></P>
<P>Many of the Con&s;pirators have already been tried, condemned and executed, for the abominable Parts they have acted in this execrable Con&s;piracy: And <HI>Hugh|&s;on</HI> him&s;elf, his <HI>Wife, Daughter</HI> and <HI>Margaret Kerry,</HI> are under that Sentence of Death which now awaits their Execution, the ju&s;t Demerits of their heinous Crimes.</P>
<P><HI>Gentlemen,</HI></P>
<P>As all the Pri&s;oners at the Bar are Negroes, the Evi|dence of other Negroes is made &s;ufficient again&s;t them by a Law of this Province; which I thought proper to ob&s;erve to you, becau&s;e we &s;hall examine &s;everal Negro Witne&s;&s;es to prove what I have alledged again&s;t the&s;e Negro Pri&s;oners; and when you have heard their Charge proved again&s;t them, I can't doubt but you will, for your Oath's Sake, and for your own and this City and Country's Peace and Safety, find the Pri&s;oners Guilty.</P>
<P>We &s;hall now call the Witne&s;&s;es and examine them before you.</P></Q>

<P>THIS Day <HI>John Hugh&s;on, Sarah</HI> his Wife, and <HI>Margaret Kerry,</HI> were executed according to Sentence.</P>
<P>The Under-Sheriff had often advi&s;ed <HI>John Hugh&s;on</HI> to make a Confe&s;&s;ion about the Con&s;piracy; but he always denied he knew any Thing of the Matter; &s;aid he had de&s;erved Death for receiving &s;tolen Goods. The Wife was ever <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ullen; &s;aid <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ttle or nothing, but denied all.</P>
<P>The Sheriffs ob&s;erved <HI>John Hugh&s;on,</HI> when he was brought out of Jail to be carried to Execution, to have a red Spot in each Cheek, about the Bigne&s;s of a Shilling; which at that Time they thought very remarkable; for he was always pale of Vi&s;age: The&s;e Spots continued all along to the Gallows: Among&s;t other Di&s;cour&s;e it &s;eems he had &s;aid, <HI>he did not doubt but &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">me remarkable Sign would happen to him, to &s;hew his Innocence;</HI> concerning w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ch more will be ob&s;erved upon hereafter: He &s;tood up in the Cart all the Way, looking round about him as if expecting to be re&s;cued; as was by many conj<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">ured from the Air he appeared in: One Hand was lifted up as high as his Pinion would admit of, and a Finger pointing, as if intending to beckon.</P>
<P>At the Gallows his Wife &s;tood like a lifele&s;s Trunk, with the Rope about her Neck tied up to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ree; &s;he &s;aid not a Word, and had &s;carce any vi&s;ible Motion.</P>

<P>But they <HI>all died, having prote&s;ted their Innocence to the la&s;t,</HI> touching the Con&s;piracy.</P>
<P>This Old Woman, as it has been generally reported, was bred a Papi&s;t; and <HI>Peggy</HI> was much &s;u&s;pected of the &s;ame Per&s;ua&s;ion,<NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="foot"><HI>See</HI> Sarah Hugh&s;on'<HI>s Confe&s;&s;ion,</HI> NUMB.

<P>Then the Third Ju&s;tice proceeded as followeth.</P>
<Q><P>YOU, the Criminals at the Bar, hearken to what is now to be &s;aid to you.</P>
<P>You <HI>Ben,</HI> by the Cour&s;e of the Evidence appear to have been a principal Ringleader in this mo&s;t horrid and devili&s;h Con&s;piracy, this Ma&s;t-piece of Villainy.</P>

Thou v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">le Wretch! How much does thy Ingratitude enhance your Guilt! And your hypocritical, canting Behaviour upon your Trial, your Prote&s;tations of Inno|cence, your Di&s;&s;imulation before God and Man, will be no &s;mall Article again&s;t you at the Day of Judgment; for ye have all Souls to be &s;aved or to be damned; your Spirits are immortal, that is to &s;ay, They will live for|ever, to be either eternally happy or eternally mi&s;erable in the other World: And <HI>be not deceived, God will not be mocked;</HI> he will not be baffled withal; he knows all your Thoughts, and &s;ees all your Actions, and will reward every one according to their Works; tho&s;e that have done good &s;hall go into everla&s;ting Re&s;t and Hap|pine&s;s; that is to &s;ay, into Life eternal; and they that have done evil, and dye hardy and impenient, &s;hall be thrown into the infernal Lake of Fire and Brim&s;tone, together with the Devil and his accur&s;ed Spirits, where the Worm never dyeth; that is, the biting, gnawing Worm of Con&s;cience will forever be upbraiding you, and the Fire will never be quenched; but in this Torment you mu&s;t remain under the mo&s;t bitter Weeping, Wailing, and Gna&s;hing of Teeth, Time without End.</P>
<P>If you would not have this your Portion, then let us tell you and admoni&s;h you, in Compa&s;&s;ion to your wretched mi&s;erable Souls, immediately to confe&s;s your Guilt, your horrid Sins, before God and Man, and di&s;cover your Accomplices, that you may prevent all further Mi&s;chief, which may otherwi&s;e happen from this your helli&s;h Con|&s;piracy; &s;incerely and heartily bewail your heinous and crying Sins, and entreat Forgivene&s;s of God Almighty; for upon the&s;e Con&s;iderations only, can you entertain any rational or well grounded Hope of being received into the Arms of his Mercy.</P>
<P>And now, What is the End of all the&s;e your mo&s;t wicked, dete&s;table, and horrible Devices? Why, you have &s;uc|ceeded &s;o far as to put Part of your accur&s;ed Scheme in Execution; You have burnt down and con&s;umed the King's Hou&s;e and Buildings in the Fort; the Hou&s;e of <HI>Van Zant,</HI> and have made Attempts to burn &s;everal others, which God Almighty in Mercy and his won|derful and gracious good Providence, has prevented, by &s;uffering the Flames to be timely extingui&s;hed; the Villanies of the&s;e diabolical Confederates have been de|tected; many of them have already met with their De|&s;erts, and are gone to their long Homes, whither you are in a few Hours to follow them; for you are now al&s;o delivered into the Hands of our Laws, and in this World you mu&s;t have Ju&s;tice, and you are left to the Mercy of God in the next.</P>
<P>What has already been &s;aid, is applicable, mo&s;t of it, to every one of you.</P>
<P>And, in as particular a Manner, <HI>Qua&s;h,</HI> may you be upbraided with the like Reproaches for your Ingra|titude; for as we have been informed, you have likewi&s;e had a very indulgent Ma&s;ter, who has put great Tru&s;t and Confidence in you; it may be pre&s;umed, from your having better Sen&s;e than the re&s;t of his Negroes; how vilely then have you abu&s;ed his Indulgence!

<P>It is a very irk&s;ome Ta&s;k to pronounce that Sentence which the Law requires of us; for we delight not in any Man's Blood; but the Law adjudges you unfit to live.</P>

<P>Mr. <HI>Murray</HI> &s;ummed up again&s;t <HI>Augu&s;tine</HI> and <HI>Juan.</HI></P>
<P>Then the Court charged the Jury as followeth.</P>
<Q><P><HI>Gentlemen of the Jury,</HI></P>
<P>THE Pri&s;oners at the Bar &s;tand charged upon two &s;everal Indictments, for con&s;piring to burn and de|&s;troy this City, and murder the Inhabitants.</P>
<P>The one Indictment is grounded upon an Act of A&s;&s;embly of this Province, &s;uppo&s;ing them to be Slaves, by which Act the Te&s;timony of one Negro Slave &s;hall be legal Evidence again&s;t another.</P>
<P>But it has been made a Que&s;tion, whether the&s;e Pri|&s;oners, now before us, are Slaves or not; and the Pri&s;o|ners them&s;elves pretend to be free Subjects of the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> with whom we are now at War, from whom they have been taken, and made Prize, and have been condemned, and adjudged as &s;uch in the Court of Admi|ralty here, without any Plea being offered there, or &s;o much as any Claim or Pretence of the Pri&s;oners being entitled to any Privilege, as being free Subjects of <HI>Spain;</HI> and &s;urely, there never could have been a more proper Time and Sea&s;on for them to have &s;et up &s;uch Pretence, as when their Ca&s;e was depending before the Court of Admiralty, where they &s;hould have offered it by Way of Plea; e&s;pecially con&s;idering, that by their Neglect of that Opportunity, they mu&s;t well know the Con&s;equence would be their being adjudged as Part of the Goods and Chattels of the Subjects of <HI>Spain,</HI> would be condemned as lawful Prize, and would al&s;o be &s;old as Slaves; but if this Pretence had been offered there, (as it was not) and they could not have proved the Truth of the Plea, it would not have availed them; but they mu&s;t have been adjudged to be Slaves.</P>
<P>But they have made that Pretence in this Court; and what has been offered in Support of it? Why, there has been &s;everal Witne&s;&s;es that have &s;poke to the Point; and what is the Amount of their Te&s;timony? Why, it is no more than the Hear&s;ay of an Hear&s;ay of a Per|&s;on, who imagined or believed, that they, or mo&s;t of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Negroes taken by Capt. <HI>Lu&s;h</HI> were Freemen; but which of them were, or were not, he could not &s;ay; nor does it appear, that the Pri&s;oners at the Bar, or any of them, are &s;uch of Capt. <HI>Lu&s;h'</HI>s Prize-Pri&s;oners, as that the &s;aid <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Gentleman imagined were Free; for it was no more than his Imagination, as to any of them being &s;uch.</P>
<P>You have heard the Adjudication and Decree of the Court of Admiralty read, by which it appears, they were condemned as Prize; and that they were &s;old as Slaves, has been proved by the Vendue-Ma&s;ter; therefore for what appears now before the Court, it &s;hould &s;eem, that they realy are Slaves: And as nothing appears; no &s;ufficient or proper Evidence appears to the Contrary; then if you take them upon the&s;e Con&s;iderations, to be Slaves; all the Negro Evidence which has been given upon this Trial again&s;t them, is legal Evidence; and &s;o you are to con&s;ider of that Te&s;timony, and let it have its full Force; and if you &s;hould have &s;ufficient Rea&s;ons in your own Con&s;ciences to di&s;credit them, and that not|with&s;tanding the Weight of that Evidence, you can think them, or any of them, not guilty, you will then &s;ay &s;o, and acquit them, or &s;uch of them as you think Innocent as to the Charge of this Indictment, upon the Act of A&s;&s;embly.</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="005413_0091_10170FE30188B340">
<HI>Gentlemen,</HI></P>
<P>The Pri&s;oners having &s;tarted this Pretence, of being free Subjects of the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> in ca&s;e it &s;hould have happened upon this Trial, as we think it has not, that there &s;hould be &s;ufficient Evidence to &s;hew that the Pri&s;oners were Freemen; if we could take them to be &s;uch; is it fit, that Per&s;ons guilty of &s;o atrocious and enormous Crimes (let them be free or bond) &s;uch execrable Villains &s;hould mi&s;s of their de&s;erved Puni&s;h|ments and e&s;cape the Ju&s;tice of the Law? Surely, that would be very unbecoming, that &s;uch Wickedne&s;s &s;hould be &s;uffered with Impunity in any well regulated Government or Society: Therefore, be they Freemen, or be they Slaves, the main Que&s;tion before you is, whe|ther they, or any, or which of them are guilty of the Charge again&s;t them, in the &s;econd Indictment, of con|&s;piring with other Slaves and Per&s;ons to burn the Hou&s;e in the Fort, to burn the Town, and murder and de&s;troy the People.</P>
<P>To prove the Charge in this Indictment, there was the Te&s;timony of <HI>Mary Burton;</HI> I mu&s;t ob&s;erve to you, that her Te&s;timony, as to the Charge in this Indictment, is &s;ingle; there is no other Witne&s;s; but neverthele&s;s, <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> one Witne&s;s is &s;ufficient; and if you give Credit to her Te&s;timony, you will, no doubt, di&s;charge a good Con&s;cience, and find them Guilty; If you &s;hould have &s;ufficient Rea&s;on in your own Minds to di&s;credit her Te&s;timony, if you can think &s;o, you mu&s;t then acquit them: The Pri&s;oners &s;eem all to be equally involved, by her Te&s;timony, in this unparalelled and helli&s;h Con|&s;piracy, and there is no Room to make any Difference between them; therefore, you will either acquit them all, or find them all Guilty.</P></Q>
<P>Then the Jury withdrew, and in about half an Hour, returned, and found them all GUILTY.</P>

<HEAD>DEPOSITION of MARY BURTON, Taken before one of the Judges.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">NUMB. IV</HEAD>
<P><HI>MARY BURTON</HI> being duly Sworn, depo&s;ed,</P>
<Q REND="margQuotes"><P N="1">1. That the Per&s;on Ye&s;terday &s;hewn to her in Pri&s;on, lately taken into Cu&s;tody on Su&s;picion of being a <HI>Roman Catholick Prie&s;t,</HI> is the &s;ame Per&s;on &s;he has often &s;een at the Hou&s;e of <HI>John Hugh&s;on:</HI> That to the be&s;t of her Remembrance &s;he &s;aw him there fir&s;t, &s;ome time about Chri&s;tma&s;s la&s;t; and that then for a Fortnight together he u&s;ed to come there almo&s;t every Night, and &s;ometimes u&s;ed to lie there, but was always gone in the Morning before &s;he the Deponent got up; but &s;he well remembers he u&s;ed to go by different Names, but whether by the Name of <HI>JURY</HI> or <HI>URY,</HI> or <HI>DOYLE,</HI> &s;he cannot now depo&s;e po&s;itively; but to the be&s;t of her Remem|brance, &s;ome of his Names con&s;i&s;ted only of one Syllable, and believes &s;he has heard him called by all the &s;aid three Names.</P>
<P N="2">2. That after the &s;aid Fortnight, &s;he believes the &s;aid Per&s;on did not come to <HI>Hugh&s;on'</HI>s for about a Week; that then he u&s;ed to come again frequently almo&s;t every Night, until the Time of the Stealing of <HI>Hogg'</HI>s Goods: He u&s;ed to &s;trip him&s;elf and go to Bed, as if he was to lie there all Night; but was always gone in the Morning when this Deponent got out of Bed.</P>
<P N="3">3. That when he came to <HI>Hugh&s;on'</HI>s, he always went up Stairs in the Company of <HI>Hugh&s;on, his Wife and Daughter, and Peggy,</HI> with whom the Negroes u&s;ed to be at the &s;ame Time con&s;ulting about the Plot; and that &s;he has often heard Hugh&s;on, <HI>the re&s;t of the white People, and the Negroes, talk in the Pre&s;ence of the &s;aid</HI> Jury, <HI>about &s;etting fire to the Hou&s;es, and killing the white People of this City;</HI> and has often, when &s;uch Conver&s;ation was going on, &s;een the &s;aid <HI>Jury,</HI> alias <HI>Ury,</HI> whi&s;pering to <HI>Hugh&s;on, his Wife, &amp;c. and the Negroes,</HI> which &s;he under&s;tood to be joining in the Con&s;piracy with them; &s;he thought it looked very like it; tho' &s;he cannot &s;ay &s;he ever heard him &s;peak out; but &s;aid, &s;he e&s;teemed his Actions and Behaviour to &s;ignify his Approbation and Con&s;ent to what was carrying on by the Company, touching this Con&s;piracy; and this not one Time in particular, but a great many.</P>
<P N="4">4. That the Con&s;pirators before mentioned generally went into a Room above Stairs to hold their Con&s;ulta|tions, and the Deponent (being a Servant in the Hou&s;e) u&s;ed often to go into that Room to carry &s;uch Things as they wanted; and often came in upon them at &s;uch Sea&s;ons, when (as &s;he believes) they would rather have excu&s;ed her Appearance; for &s;he has ob&s;erved, that her coming in has &s;ometimes made <HI>Jury</HI> unea&s;y; that they u&s;ed generally to call up <HI>Mary Hugh&s;on</HI> the Daughter, to bring what they wanted; but when &s;he was out of the Way, the Deponent u&s;ed to go up: She believes
<PB N="96" REF="005413_0104_10173A6961D5A2E8">
the &s;aid <HI>Mary</HI> was likewi&s;e in their Secrets: <HI>Never heard her &s;ay any Thing of the Plot,</HI> but has heard the re&s;t talk of it often before her the &s;aid <HI>Mary.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. That <HI>Hugh&s;on, his Wife, Daughter Sarah, and Peggy, and the &s;aid Ury,</HI> when this Deponent has come into the Room among&s;t them to bring what they wanted, have &s;everal Times turned out all the Negroes pre&s;ent, and then have <HI>all joined in tempting this Deponent to take an Oath;</HI> but upon her a&s;king them for what? they would not tell her; but &s;aid, <HI>&s;he mu&s;t &s;wear fir&s;t, and then they would tell her;</HI> but this &s;he ab&s;olutely denied over and over; at which Refu&s;al they were angry, and turned her out of the Room; and <HI>Ury</HI> &s;aid to her, <HI>had not you better &s;wear and go fine, than go as &s;he did;</HI> for they <HI>all</HI> (the Hugh&s;ons, Peggy <HI>and</HI> Jury, <HI>had when they propo&s;ed to her to &s;wear</HI>) offered her Silks, and a deal of fine Things, if &s;he would comply with their Reque&s;ts; and <HI>Peggy</HI> &s;aid &s;he was a great Fool if &s;he did not.</P>
<P N="6">6. That about a Fortnight or three Weeks before <HI>Hogg's</HI> Goods were &s;tolen, &s;he has ob&s;erved <HI>Campbell</HI> (with whom &s;he has heard <HI>Jury</HI> u&s;ed to keep School) come to <HI>Hugh&s;on's</HI> of a Sunday, &s;ometimes one <HI>Garr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t Van Emborough</HI> with him; and that <HI>Campbell</HI> u&s;ed to go into the Room below with the <HI>Hugh&s;ons, Peggy,</HI> and <HI>Cae&s;ar, Prince</HI> and <HI>Cuffee,</HI> (Negroes) and when the&s;e were met, the <HI>Hugh&s;ons</HI> u&s;ed to turn the Deponent up Stairs: But &s;he can't &s;ay &s;he ever heard them talking of the Plot before <HI>Campbell,</HI> but &s;he &s;trongly &s;u&s;pected that he knew of it, from his keeping Company with the <HI>Hugh&s;ons, and the &s;aid three Negroes,</HI> whom &s;he looked upon to be the principal Heads of the Negroes in the Con&s;piracy.</P>
<P N="7">7. That during the Time there was Snow upon the Ground, all la&s;t Winter, &s;he has often known <HI>Hugh&s;on</HI> to go out of Town a-Days, upon the Pretence of fetch|ing Firewood from the Commons, with his Sleigh; and that he has not returned Home 'til Eight, Nine, Ten or Eleven o'Clock at Night, at different Times, and has brought Negroes to Town to his Hou&s;e; and that he has carried them back again in his Sleigh after Midnight, One, Two or Three o'Clock, and has not returned Home again &s;ometimes till Seven or Eight o'Clock in the Morning.</P>
<P N="8">8. That &s;he has &s;everal Times &s;een Mr. <HI>Peter De Lancey'</HI>s Spani&s;h Negro <HI>Antonio</HI> at <HI>Hugh&s;on's,</HI> when he <HI>(Hugh&s;on)</HI> has come Home late out of the Wood<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">; and that &s;he has &s;een him many Times get into <HI>Hugh&s;on'</HI>s Sleigh late in the Night; and that <HI>Hugh&s;on</HI> has not returned Home '<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">il Six, Seven or Eight the next Morning: But at that Time this Deponent did not know where the &s;aid Spani&s;h Negro lived, whether in Town or Country.</P>
<P N="9">9. That one Day at <HI>Hugh&s;on's,</HI> &s;ome of the Negroes had behaved rudely towards her, and being in a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;he was provoked to &s;wear at them in the Pre&s;ence of <HI>Jury,</HI> alias <HI>Ury,</HI> above mentioned, and upon recollecting her&s;elf &s;he &s;aid, <HI>God forgive me:</HI> whereupon the &s;aid <HI>Ury</HI> an&s;wered her, <HI>That was a &s;mall Matter; be could forgive her a great deal more Sins than that; that was Nothing.</HI></P>
<P N="10">10.

<P>This Negro, <HI>Adam,</HI> was very willing to lay hold of the Benefit of the Proclamation beforementioned, but would intitle him&s;elf to it by &s;aying as little as po&s;&s;ible to enlarge the Di&s;covery of the Confederates in this <HI>dark Scheme:</HI> He was under Examination &s;everal Hours, &s;everal Days running; the Information that he gave came from him &s;lowly and by piece-meals, which was very tire&s;ome; and gave &s;o much Trouble, that he was &s;everal Times remanded to Jail, and told that what he &s;aid would do him little Service; but as the Con&s;table was taking him away, he would beg to &s;tay, and &s;ay he would tell of all he could recollect. While he was under Examination this Day, it was told before <HI>Adam,</HI> that the Chief Ju&s;tice's Negro <HI>Othello</HI> was brought from <HI>Rhode I&s;land,</HI> and carrying to Jail, and hearing that, he immediately &s;aid, <HI>Othello, was con|cerned in the Plot;</HI> as if naturally concluding that &s;ome Body el&s;e had impeached him; for till this Accident, he had not mentioned his Name. This <HI>Adam</HI> had a general Acquaintance among&s;t the Negroes, and idle Time enough for doing any Mi&s;chief; and 'twas &s;uppo&s;ed, that he mu&s;t have known mo&s;t of the Negroes concerned; though he mentioned very few but what we were apprized of before, and had already been either executed or apprehended.</P>
<P>It was ob&s;erved by &s;everal in Mr. <HI>Murray's</HI> Family, &s;ome Time before <HI>Adam's</HI> Commitment, that his Behaviour was &s;uch as betokened &s;trong Symptoms of Guilt; he appeared very unea&s;y and di&s;turbed in his Mind; and much more &s;o when <HI>Jack</HI> his Fellow-Servant was taken up as one con|cerned in the Con&s;piracy; for the next Morning he came &s;everal Times into the Clerk's Office, with a &s;eeming Inten|tion to di&s;clo&s;e &s;ome Secret; the young Gentlemen at la&s;t took Notice of it, and &s;hutting the Door too, a&s;ked him, Whether he knew any Thing of the Plot? He denied he did; but &s;aid, <HI>he was afraid &s;ome Dog or another would own him a Spite, and bring him in; for that People talked a great Deal of him.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="005413_0114_10173A8B4F55C030">
In the Afternoon, Mr. <HI>Murray</HI> having been pre&s;ent and a&s;&s;i&s;ting at his Negro <HI>Jack's</HI> Examination, upon his Return home, found <HI>Adam</HI> running backwards and forwards like a di&s;tracted Creature; he called him into his Study, and charged him as one concerned in the Con&s;piracy; which he ab&s;olutely denied, and prote&s;ted his Innocence: His Ma&s;ter endeavoured, and u&s;ed many Arguments, to prevail with him to confe&s;s if he was guilty, but to no Purpo&s;e; and then he delivered him to the Con&s;table.</P>
<P>In the Evening two of Mr. <HI>Murray's</HI> Clerks went to &s;ee <HI>Adam</HI> in the Jail, to try how far they could prevail upon him: and as &s;oon as he knew they were come, he de&s;ired Leave to &s;peak with them <HI>Privately;</HI> which being granted, he began with Exclamations, and Prote&s;tations of his Innocence, declaring <HI>that it was Nothing but damn'd Lies that brought him there; that he knew who was the Author of them, and would be revenged if he died for it.</HI> The young Gentlemen rea&s;oned with him, telling him if he was innocent to in&s;i&s;t upon it, and not be afraid; for he might be a&s;&s;ured of having Ju&s;tice done him; but if he was guilty, his denying it would &s;ignify Nothing; for that <HI>they</HI> knew as much of the Plot, as they that were concerned in it; and the only Way to recommend him&s;elf to Favour, was by making a full Confe&s;&s;ion: He then con&s;idered a while; and de&s;ired to know his Accu&s;er; they told him, they believed it was <HI>Jack;</HI> which a&s;&s;oon as he heard, he &s;aid, <HI>then I am a dead Man; &s;triking his Head again&s;t one of the Beams of the Jail;</HI> and &s;aid further, <HI>he was afraid the Dog would have &s;erved him &s;o.</HI> Then he gave the young Gentlemen his Shoe-and Knee-Buckles [being Silver] and &s;ome other Things, de&s;iring they might be delivered to his Brother <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> [another Negro of Mr <HI>Murray'</HI>s.] In this Manner they parly'd with him a full Hour, 'til at length, tired with his Ob&s;tinacy, they concluded to leave him; but he pre&s;&s;ed them to &s;tay, &s;till giving them &s;ome Hopes of his Confe&s;&s;ion: They told him they had no Occa&s;ion to &s;tay to hear him repeat the &s;ame Things over again: He then a&s;ked them, what they would have him to &s;ay? Upon which they told him, they would have him <HI>&s;peak &s;incerely,</HI> whether he was <HI>guilty or not:</HI> Why then &s;aid he, <HI>to &s;peak &s;incerely, I am guilty.</HI></P>

<P>Now many Negroes began to &s;queak, in order to lay hold of the Benefit of the Proclamation; &s;ome who had been apprehended but not indicted; and many who had been indicted and arraigned, who had pleaded <HI>Not Guilty,</HI> were di&s;po&s;ed to retract their Pleas and plead <HI>Guilty,</HI> and throw them&s;elves on the Mercy of the Court; &s;o that Confe&s;&s;ions were like to be numerous, and Bu&s;ine&s;s to mul|tiply upon our Hands; which made it nece&s;&s;ary to call in &s;ome Gentlemen of the Law to our A&s;&s;i&s;tance upon the Occa&s;ion, who very readily undertook the Ta&s;k.</P>
<P>Before the i&s;&s;uing of the Proclamation of the 19th In&s;tant, <HI>for the Encouragement of the Con&s;pirators to come in, and make voluntary and free confe&s;&s;ion and Di&s;covery, &amp;c.</HI> there were betwixt Sixty and Seventy Negroes in Jail. who had been already impeached; many of whom after publi&s;hing the Proclamation, not only confe&s;&s;ed their own Guilt, in order to entitle them&s;elves to the Benefit of it, as may appear by the foregoing Examinations; but al&s;o di&s;covered many of their Accomplices who were at large; who were thereupon immediately taken into Cu&s;tody, by Order of the Judges, or Grand Jury, as the Ca&s;e happen'd before whom &s;uch Confe&s;&s;ions were made; &s;o that between the 19th and this Day, there were upwards of Thirty Slaves more added to the former, in&s;omuch that the Jail began to be &s;o thronged, 'twas difficult to find Room for them: and we were apprehen&s;ive, that the Criminals would be daily multiplying on our Hands; nor could we &s;ee any Likelihood of a Stop to Impeachments; for it &s;eemed very probable that mo&s;t of the Negroes in Town were corrupted.</P>
<P>The Sea&s;on began to grow warm, as u&s;ual; and 'twas to be expected that the Heat would be increa&s;ing upon us daily; &s;o that the Judges found there was a Nece&s;&s;ity of bethinking them&s;elves of taking &s;uch &s;peedy Mea&s;ures; as &s;hould upon Deliberation be thought mo&s;t advi&s;eable, for ridding the Jail of &s;uch of them as &s;hould by their Con|fe&s;&s;ions be thought mo&s;t de&s;erving of Recommendation to Mercy; for 'twas feared &s;uch Numbers of them clo&s;ely confined together, might breed an Infection; and they mu&s;t needs have been very offen&s;ive to the poor Debtors impri|&s;oned in the City-Hall, which from the Nece&s;&s;ity of the Ca&s;e could not have been prevented or remedied: There|fore the Judges a&s;&s;ociated to them the &s;everal Gentlemen of the Law that were in Town, <HI>viz.</HI> Me&s;&s;ieurs MURRAY, ALEXANDER, SMITH, CHAMBERS, JAMISON, NICHOLLS and LODGE, in order to con&s;ult about this Matter, and come to &s;ome Re&s;olution upon the Emergency.</P>
<P>The Re&s;ult of the Meeting was, tho&s;e Gentlemen unanimou&s;ly agreed to bear their re&s;pective Shares in the Fatigue of the &s;everal Pro&s;ecutions; and &s;ettled among them&s;elves the Part each &s;hould take: Me&s;&s;ieurs MURRAY, ALEXANDER, SMITH and CHAMBERS, were to a&s;&s;i&s;t in their Turns, as Council upon the &s;everal Trials, as it &s;hould be&s;t &s;uit their re&s;pective Convenience, and Me&s;&s;ieurs NICHOLLS and LODGE, to take the Negroes Confe&s;&s;ions, and ab&s;tract them and the other Evidence into Briefs, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Council upon the Trials.

Hugh&s;on's</HI> or <HI>Comfort'</HI>s; for <HI>Jack, Comfort'</HI>s Negro, was a principal Agent for <HI>Hugh&s;on,</HI> and (as may already have been ob&s;erved from the Cour&s;e of the Evidence) had corrupted many Negroes, and admini&s;tred the Con&s;pirators Oath to them.</P>
<P>The Negroes in general that came to a Confe&s;&s;ion agreed in the Impeachment of <HI>Hugh&s;on and his Family;</HI> that the Drift of the Plot was <HI>to burn the Town and de&s;troy the Inhabitants;</HI> that they were <HI>&s;worn</HI> into the Confederacy at <HI>Hugh&s;on'</HI>s, or by <HI>Hugh&s;on,</HI> or &s;ome Per&s;on intru&s;ted by him for that Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>As this was already di&s;covered to be the execrable Purpo&s;e of the Con&s;piracy, the&s;e Gentlemen (con&s;idering the great Number to be examined) for the Sake of Di&s;patch, dropt what was at this Time lea&s;t material, and only minuted down the Per&s;ons accu&s;ed, the Matter affecting them, where and by whom &s;worn, and what el&s;e came from their Examinant which they judged to be mo&s;t &s;ignificant; which is the Rea&s;on that the Examinations and Confe&s;&s;ions taken by tho&s;e two Gentlemen are &s;o conci&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>But further;</HI> in order to &s;ave Room, and avoid drawing out this <HI>JOURNAL</HI> to an unnece&s;&s;ary Length, which of it&s;elf is like to &s;pin out to a Degree beyond Patience; the Compiler cho&s;e not to &s;et them forth in the &s;ame Manner they were taken, but made them yet &s;horter, by incorpo|rating the Sub&s;tance of the &s;everal Columns into the Form in which they now appear.</P>

<Q REND="margQuotes"><P N="1">1<HI>&s;t.</HI> THAT they were taken with &s;ome <HI>Spaniards</HI> by an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Privateer; were brought into this Port, and condemned as lawful Prize, being &s;uppos'd to be Slaves belonging to the Subjects of the King of <HI>Spain;</HI> and Nothing appear'd to the Court of Admiralty (which is the Court, to which Juri&s;diction concerning Things of this Nature does properly belong) to &s;hew that they were Freemen; and they having made no Pretence or Claim in that Court to be &s;uch, they were therefore adjudg'd to be Slaves.</P>
<P N="2">2<HI>dly.</HI> That the Court of Admiralty having &s;o ad|judg'd them to be Slaves, they had been &s;everally &s;old and di&s;po&s;ed of; by which means they were di&s;charged from Confinement in Pri&s;on; and thereby have had the Opportunity of caballing with other wicked, mi&s;chievous and evil di&s;po&s;ed Per&s;ons, as well White-Men as Slaves, and have confederated them&s;elves with them, in a mo&s;t diabolical Con&s;piracy, <HI>to lay this City in A&s;hes, and to murder and de&s;troy all the Inhabitants;</HI> whereas had they appear'd to have been Freemen, they would have been prevented this Opportunity of venting and gratifying the Rancour of their Hearts, by being clo&s;ely confined as Pri&s;oners of War.</P>
<P N="3">3<HI>dly,</HI> If notwith&s;tanding they were Free-men, they ought in all Rea&s;on to have waited the Event of the War, and &s;uffer'd patiently under their Misfortune; and when Peace &s;hould have been concluded, they might have made the Truth of their Preten&s;ions appear, and then Ju&s;tice would have been done them.</P>

<P>Some few Days before this, the Town was amu&s;ed with a Rumour, that <HI>Hugh&s;on</HI> was turned <HI>Negro,</HI> and Vaarck's <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> a <HI>White;</HI> and when they came to put up <HI>York</HI> in Chains by <HI>Hugh&s;on</HI> (who was hung upon the Gibbet three Weeks before) &s;o much of him as was vi&s;ible, <HI>viz.</HI> Face, Neck, Hands and Feet, were of a deep &s;hining Black, rather blacker than the Negro placed by him, who was one of the darke&s;t Hue of his Kind; and the Hair of <HI>Hugh&s;on</HI>'s Beard and Neck (his Head could not be &s;een, for he had a Cap on) was curling like the Wool of a Negro's Beard and Head; and the Features of his Face were of the Symmetry of a Negro Beauty; the No&s;e broad and flat, the No&s;trils open and extended, the Mouth wide, Lips full and thick, his Body, (which when living, was tall by the View upwards of &s;ix Feet, but very meagre) &s;well'd to a Gigantick Size; and as to <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> (who, tho' executed for a Robbery, was al&s;o one of the Head Negro Con&s;pirators, had been hung up in Chains a Month before <HI>Hugh&s;on,</HI> and was al&s;o of the darke&s;t Complexion) his Face was at the &s;ame Time &s;omewhat bleach'd or turned whiti&s;h; in&s;omuch that it occa&s;ion'd a Remark, That <HI>Hugh&s;on</HI> and <HI>he</HI> had changed Colours. The Beholders were amazed at the&s;e Appearances; the Report of them engaged the Attention of many, and drew Numbers of all Ranks, who had Curio&s;ity, to the Gibbets, for &s;everal Days running, in order to be convinced by their own Eyes, of the Reality of Things &s;o confidently reported to be, at lea&s;t, wonderous Phaenomenons; and upon the View they were found to be &s;uch as have been de&s;cribed: Many of the Spectators were ready to re&s;olve them into Miracles; however, others not &s;o ha&s;ty, though &s;urprized at the Sights, were willing to account for them in a natural Way; &s;o that they admi|ni&s;tred Matter for much Speculation.</P>
<P>The Sun at this Time had great Power, and the Sea&s;on as u&s;ual very hot, that <HI>Hugh&s;on</HI>'s Body drip'd and di&s;till'd very much, as it needs mu&s;t, from the great Fermentation and Abundance of Matter within him, as could not but be &s;uppo&s;ed <HI>at that Time,</HI> from the extraordinary Bulk of his Body; tho' con&s;idering the Force of the Sun, and the natural Meagrene&s;s of his Crops, one would have been apt to imagine, that long 'ere this, it would have been di&s;en|cumbered of all its Juices. At length, about ten Days or a Fortnight after <HI>Hugh&s;on</HI>'s Mate, <HI>York,</HI> was hung by him, <HI>Hugh&s;on</HI>'s Corps unable longer to contain its Load, bur&s;t and di&s;charged Pails full<NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Which may be under&s;tood to mean a &s;urprizing Quantity.</HI></NOTE> of Blood and Corruption; This was te&s;tified by tho&s;e who were near by, fi&s;hing upon the Beach when the Irruption happen'd, to whom the Stench of it was very offen&s;ive.</P>

<HI>Mary Burton</HI> &s;peaks of their having Poi&s;on among&s;t them<NOTE N="(g)" PLACE="foot"><HI>In her Evidence upon Trial of eight Negroes 15th of this Month,</HI> viz. <HI>her Te&s;timony again&s;t</HI> Doctor Harry.</NOTE> &s;he &s;ays, <Q>She had &s;een <HI>three or four Papers</HI> of Poi&s;on in <HI>Hugh&s;on</HI>'s Drawers, which &s;he under&s;tood he had of &s;ome Negro.</Q></P>
<P>It has been related already<NOTE N="(h)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Page</HI> 72.</NOTE> that <HI>Hugh&s;on</HI> when he was brought out of Jail to be carried to his Execution, had a red Spot in each Cheek, about the Bigne&s;s of a Shilling, which at that Time was by &s;ome thought very remarkable, becau&s;e he was always pale of Vi&s;age; and the Sheriff (who ob&s;erved it) did not believe, from the Care that had been ta|ken, he could have drank any &s;trong Liquor in Jail; which was an additional Rea&s;on why they took &s;o much Notice of it.</P>
<P>Upon the Suppo&s;ition that <HI>Hugh&s;on</HI> had taken Poi&s;on, it has been made a Que&s;tion, whether that might not have occa&s;ioned the Swelling of his Corps to &s;o amazing a Bulk? Nay his Arms, Legs, and Thighs, were enlarged in Pro|portion to the Body; this is &s;ubmitted to the Con&s;ideration of the Curious and Connoi&s;&s;eurs in <HI>Phy&s;ick.</HI></P>
<P>As to the Change of Complexions in <HI>Hugh&s;on</HI> and <HI>Cae&s;ar,</HI> &s;ome imputed it to the Influence of the Sun; but to that it was objected, it would be &s;trange indeed, that the Sun &s;hould have two &s;uch different Effects as to turn <HI>Hugh&s;on</HI> [a White] black, and <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> [a Negro] whiti&s;h.</P>
<P>As to <HI>Hugh&s;on</HI>'s taking Poi&s;on, that by &s;ome was thought very improbable; for, as 'tis &s;aid, in the Account of his Behaviour at, and going to his Execution, his Actions were ob&s;erved to be &s;uch, as betokened his Expectation of being re&s;cued; he held up his Hand as high as his Pinion would admit of, and &s;eemed to beckon with his Finger, as one expecting Deliverance; and if that was his Per&s;ua&s;ion, he would not have taken Poi&s;on, which was certain Death; and be&s;ides, if he had taken any, he would have taken a &s;ufficient Quantity, and Time enough, to have an&s;wered the De&s;ign of it, which mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed to be, to de&s;troy him&s;elf to prevent his Execution.</P>
<P>To this it was an&s;wered, that though he might be deter|mined to take Poi&s;on to de&s;troy him&s;elf, and did take &s;ome, yet he might do it with &s;o much Reluctance, as not to take the Quantity pre&s;cribed &s;ufficient to an&s;wer the End; which tho' he might not be aware of, but expect certain Death from it, yet the nearer he approached the Gallows, the more his Thoughts might be confu&s;ed, and Nature pre|vailed; as long as there is Life, there is Hopes, and his Deliverance might be uppermo&s;t in his Mind; he would willingly have avoided the Infamy of Hanging, and &s;tand the Chance of &s;aving his Life into the Bargain.</P>
<P>Whatever were the Cau&s;es of the&s;e Changes, the Facts are here related, that every one may make their own Con|ectures upon them.</P>
<P>But <HI>Hugh&s;on</HI> it &s;eems, let the wor&s;t happen to him in all Events, declared as he was going to mount the Cart which was to carry him to Execution, <Q>that he did not doubt but &s;ome remarkable Sign would happen to him, to &s;hew [or &s;ignify] <HI>his Innocence,</HI></Q> and if his Corps becoming mon|&s;trous in Size, and his Complexion (for once to u&s;e a vulgar Similitude) as black as the D&mdash;1, can be deemed remarkable Signs or Tokens of <HI>his Innocence!</HI> then &s;ome may imagine, it has happen'd according to his Expectation.</P>

<Q><P>IN order to maintain the Charge again&s;t the Pri&s;oner, upon this Indictment, we &s;hall produce to you the following Evidence, <HI>to wit.</HI></P>
<P>That the Pri&s;oner was actually concerned in the Plot to burn the King's Hou&s;e, and this City, and murder the Inhabitants.</P>
<P>That he has frequently been at <HI>Hugh&s;on</HI>'s Hou&s;e, in Company with <HI>Hugh&s;on,</HI> his Wife, and Daughter, and <HI>Kerry,</HI> and with divers Negroes, talking with them about the Plot, and coun&s;elling and encouraging them to burn the King's Hou&s;e, and the Town, and to kill and de&s;troy the Inhabitants.&mdash;That the Negro <HI>Quack,</HI> who burnt the King's Hou&s;e, was pre&s;ent at one or more of tho&s;e Times, when the Pri&s;oner coun&s;elled and encouraged the Negroes as afore&s;aid.&mdash;That he advi&s;ed them what would be the fitte&s;t Time to &s;et the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Church on fire; and that the Pri&s;oner, as a <HI>Popi&s;h</HI> Prie&s;t, baptized <HI>Hugh&s;on,</HI> his Wife, and Daughter, and <HI>Kerry,</HI> and al&s;o diver&s;e Negroes, and told them then, and at &s;everal other Times, <HI>That he could forgive Sins, and that he forgave them their Sin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> relating to the Plot.</HI></P>
<P>That when he was with the Negroes at <HI>Hugh&s;on</HI>'s Hou&s;e, he u&s;ed to make a round Ring on the Floor with Chalk, or &s;ome other Thing, and &s;tand in the Middle of it <HI>with a Cro&s;s in his Hand, and &s;wear the Negroes into the Plot; and that they &s;hould not di&s;cover either the Plot, or him, or any other Per&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ncerned in it,</HI> THOUGH THEY WERE TO DIE FOR IT</P>

<P>That he went by &s;everal Names; and that when he baptized the Negroes, or any of the Con&s;pirators, he u&s;ed to tell them, <HI>he forgave them all the Sins they &s;hould commit</HI> ABOUT THE PLOT.</P>
<P>We &s;hall likewi&s;e produce to you a Letter from General <HI>Oglethorpe</HI> to his Honour our Governor, whereby it appears, <HI>That &s;ome time before the Plot broke out here, the</HI> Spaniards <HI>had employed Emi&s;&s;aries to burn all the Ma|gazines and con&s;iderable Towns in the</HI> Engli&s;h North-America: <HI>And that many</HI> PRIESTS <HI>were employed, under pretended Appellations of</HI> PHYSICIANS, DANCING-MASTERS, <HI>and &s;uch like Occupations; and under &s;uch Pretences to get Admittance into, and Confidence in, Families.</HI></P>
<P>This, <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> was their helli&s;h Device to &s;et on foot and carry on the late dreadful Con&s;piracy among us; and the Pri&s;oner, in Conjunction with <HI>Hugh&s;on (as we now have Rea&s;on to believe)</HI> drew in the re&s;t of the Con&s;pirators.</P>

<P>Then they have their Doctrine of Tran&s;ub&s;tantiation, which is &s;o big with Ab&s;urdities that 'tis &s;hocking to the common Sen&s;e and Rea&s;on of Mankind; for were that Doctrine true, their Prie&s;ts, by a few Words of their Mouths, can make a God as often as they plea&s;e; but then they eat him too; and this they have the Impudence to call honouring and adoring of him.&mdash;<HI>Bla&s;phemous Wretches!</HI> For hereby they endeavour to exalt them&s;elves above God him&s;elf, ina&s;much as the Creator mu&s;t nece&s;&s;a|rily be greater than his Creature.</P>
<P>The&s;e and many other juggling Tricks they have in their <HI>Hocus Pocus,</HI> bloody Religion; which have been &s;trip'd of all their wretched Di&s;gui&s;e, and fully expo&s;ed in their own Colours by many eminent Divines, but more particularly by the great Dr. <HI>Tillot&s;on,</HI> who&s;e extraordinary Endowment<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> of Mind, his inimitable Works, and ex|emplary Piety and Charity have gained him &s;uch univer&s;al E&s;teem and Applau&s;e throughout all the Prote&s;tant World, as, no doubt, will endure as long as the Prote&s;tant Name and Religion la&s;ts, which I hope will be to the End of Time.</P>

<Q><P>The Way I came to hear of, or know this Mr. <HI>Ury,</HI> was, that la&s;t Winter &s;ome time in <HI>February,</HI> I happened to be in Company with a Friend at Mr. <HI>Croker'</HI>s, and Mr. <HI>Webb,</HI> Joiner, called me a&s;ide, and a&s;ked me What School I had; and if I would incline to take a Partner, one very well ver&s;ed in the <HI>Engli&s;h, Latin</HI> and <HI>Greek</HI> Tongues? I an&s;wered him, what School I had I could very well manage my&s;elf; I had no Inclination for a Partner at all: He &s;aid he was a good &s;ober &s;ort of a Man, and under&s;tood his Bu&s;ine&s;s very well, and if we could agree, he did not doubt but it would do very well: I an&s;wered him, I inclined to be Ma&s;ter of my own School alone, though it was not &s;o large as if I had a Partner&punc; He &s;eeing I had no Inclination for him, did not tell me who he was.</P>
<P>Some time after, about &s;even or eight Weeks, I had a little Bu&s;ine&s;s on board Capt. <HI>Griffiths,</HI> where I met with him and <HI>Web</HI> in Company, which was the fir&s;t time I ever &s;poke to him; then, after our Salutation of each other, he began to a&s;k me &s;ome Que&s;tions concerning my School and Method of teaching; after which we &s;tepped in at <HI>Baker'</HI>s, and took a &s;erious Gla&s;s together; at which time he took a &s;mall Book out of his Pocket (<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Latin</HI>) and con&s;trued (I think) the 117th P&s;alm; then laying the Book on the Table, I took it up, and was going to look on the Title Page; but he directly &s;eized it out of my Hands, and told me I mu&s;t not look into it, and put it in his Pocket.</P>
<P>Another time at my School, I had &s;ome Di&s;cour&s;e with him concerning Mr. <HI>Whitefield'</HI>s Letter in An&s;wer to Mr. <HI>We&s;ly'</HI>s Sermon on Free-Grace; which Letter he did not approve of at all, and told me, he believed it was <HI>through the great Encouragement the Negroes had received from Mr.</HI> Whitefield, <HI>we had all this Di&s;turbance; and that he believed Mr.</HI> Whitefield <HI>was more of a</HI> Roman <HI>than any Thing el&s;e; and he believed he came abroad with no good De&s;ign.</HI> Then I a&s;ked him what was the Signification of a Non-Juror, as I under&s;tood <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e pretended to be? and he an&s;wered, tho&s;e that would not take the Oaths of Allegiance, as he did not: I a&s;ked him Why? Says he, Can you &s;wear one to be a Ba&s;tard? <HI>No:</HI> No more can they &s;ay King <HI>J</HI>&mdash;was one; and the Difference between <HI>we Non-Jurors</HI> and <HI>others,</HI> is this; we in the Prayer for the King and Royal Family, <HI>mention no Names,</HI> as they do; I a&s;ked him if they pray'd for the <HI>Pretender?</HI> he &s;aid, <HI>for him, let him be who he will, that was the King;</HI> he mentioned no Names.</P>
<P><PB N="166" REF="005413_0174_10173B556BC15EC8">
At another time, &s;ays he, you talk &s;o much again&s;t Popery, I believe though you &s;peak &s;o much again&s;t it, <HI>you will find you have (or I think will have) a Pope in your Belly;</HI> for, &s;ays he, the Ab&s;olution of the <HI>Church of Rome</HI> is not half &s;o bad as that of the <HI>Church of England</HI> at the Vi&s;itation of the Sick: But, &s;ays I, I don't approve of their confe&s;&s;ing to Prie&s;ts, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> &s;ays I, there is a deal of Wickedne&s;s and Deceit in it: Says he, No, no; for when any Per&s;on makes Confe&s;&s;ions, the Prie&s;t does not know who they be; for he does not &s;o much as &s;ee them, but only hears and ab&s;olves them: Then, &s;ays I, I was mi&s;taken. Oh! &s;ays he, they &s;peak again&s;t the <HI>Church of Rome,</HI> but don't know them; their Prie&s;ts, &s;ays he, are the mo&s;t learned of Men; the Articles of the <HI>Church of England</HI> were made in di&s;tracted Times. And I ob&s;erved &s;everal times he &s;aid, <HI>we Prie&s;ts.</HI> Says he, your <HI>Roman Prie&s;ts</HI> will make you believe, and prove by the plain Rules of Grammar, <HI>that black is white, and white black,</HI> and that the Wafer and Wine is the real Body and Blood of Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>We were often in Company; but the be&s;t Part of our Di&s;cour&s;e was upon Salvation by Faith alone, which he would not allow, nor Prede&s;tination; and he told me, he really believed the Moon to be an inhabited Planet, and all the Stars were inhabited; or el&s;e, &s;ays he, I would not repeat that Part of the <HI>Nicene</HI> Creed, <HI>Begotten of his Father before all Worlds;</HI> and, &s;ays he, many Texts of Scripture confirm it to be &s;o.</P>
<P>I was &s;everal times &s;ince in his Company, but do not remember any Thing in particular relating to Prie&s;ts, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But the la&s;t time I had any Thing of Di&s;cour&s;e was about two Days before I heard him preach, and then in his Room; I &s;eeing the Altar placed in the Corner, I a&s;ked him what U&s;e that was for? fir&s;t he &s;aid only to lay Books on, or for a Candle to &s;it and read by; but I told him I could not think it; for I &s;uppo&s;ed it for the Sacrament by its Form and odd Colour; I begged him to let me know what it was; &s;o after &s;ome time he &s;eriou&s;ly told me, it was for the Sacrament; and he told me, I think, every Saint's Day it was expo&s;ed, only covered with a Piece of white Linnen; and that he admini&s;tered on &s;ome proper Days; and he told me, they received the Wafer in&s;tead of Bread, and white in&s;tead of red Wine: I a&s;ked, why the Wafer? Becau&s;e, &s;ays he, the Wafer is more pure; and no Bread he thought pure enough to repre&s;ent the Body of our Lord; then going to his &s;mall Box, &s;ays he, I'll get a Piece and you &s;hall ta&s;te it if you will; and he brought me a Piece, and I took and eat it.</P>
<P>I think he told me, that &s;ome time before he had baptized a Child in the Hou&s;e, but they u&s;ed more Ceremonies than we; and he talked as if they anointed and wa&s;hed one another's Feet: He told me further, that at the Time of the Celebration, or at what Time the Sacrament was expo&s;ed, they had lighted Candles burning to repre&s;ent our Saviour as the Light of the World. And when I came in to hear him preach, I accordingly &s;aw it as he told me; for he told me before, that if I came on Sunday Evening to hear him, I could &s;ee it; for the Sacrament was on the Altar covered with a white Linnen Cloth, and there were three Candles burning; but not a Minute after I came in, he put out the Candles, and put his Sacrament in his Box, and locked them up.</P>
<P>Some time after I became thus acquainted with him, I was informed he kept a private Meeting, and made U&s;e of the Church Form of Prayer every Sunday Evening, at the Hou&s;e of Mr. <HI>John Campbell,</HI> in his own hired Room.</P>
<P>My Curio&s;ity led me the next Sunday Evening to go and hear him preach; but when I came there, he told me he did not make a Practice of Preaching to any others, but tho&s;e of his own Society; and tho&s;e of his Society did not make any Practice of running to any of our Churches or Meetings; for he did not approve of any &s;uch Thing; and as he was a Non Jured Mini&s;ter, &s;o he had a Society and Members of his own.</P>
<P>Afterwards he told me, he had &s;ome Company from <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> (I think) and de&s;ired to be excu&s;ed; but next Sunday Evening, if I would call, he would be glad to &s;ee me.</P>
<P>The next Sunday Evening I accordingly went, and heard him di&s;cour&s;e upon the Second Chapter of the Second Epi&s;tle of <HI>St. Peter,</HI> the 1<HI>&s;t,</HI> 2<HI>d</HI> and 3d Ver&s;es; and before he di&s;mi&s;&s;ed us, he told us he would preach the next Wedne&s;day following (being the Day his Maje&s;ty began his happy Reign) upon the 16th Chapter of <HI>St. Matthew,</HI> the 18<HI>th</HI> and 19<HI>th</HI> Ver&s;es, adjoining to them the Words of Our Lord to his Di&s;ciples, <HI>Who&s;e &s;oever Sins ye remit, they are remitted unto them, and who&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ver Sins ye retain, they are retained:</HI> Which Di&s;|cour&s;e I did not not hear.</P></Q>

<P>I became acquainted with him la&s;t Fall, and I agreed with him in <HI>December</HI> to teach my Children to write and read; That &s;everal Times in Conver&s;ation with him, he talked in &s;uch a Manner that I &s;u&s;pected him to be a Popi&s;h Prie&s;t He u&s;ed very often to mi&s;s coming to teach my Children at the School time, and made frivolous Excu&s;es; and at la&s;t I was very angry with him and di&s;|charged him: That in the Evenings he us'd very often to pretend that he mu&s;t go to pray by a &s;ick Per&s;on <HI>by the Engli&s;h Church,</HI> that belonged to his Society, or that he mu&s;t go and pray with his Society <HI>by the Engli&s;h Church:</HI><NOTE N="(x)" PLACE="foot">Hugh&s;on'<HI>s was near by it.</HI></NOTE> Whereupon I once a&s;ked him to let me go along with him; but he refu&s;ed me, and &s;aid it was not proper for any one to go there, who were not of t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e Society; which occa|&s;ioned a Jealou&s;y in me, and I had often a Mind to have dogged him, to have &s;een where he went, and do not know how it happened, but I never did.

<P>That the Pri&s;oner is a Romi&s;h Emi&s;&s;ary, &s;ent according to the Intimation in General <HI>Oglethorpe's</HI> Letter, I think mu&s;t be concluded from what has been given in Evidence again&s;t him; and from the known Principles of the Romi&s;h Reli|gion, it may be judged, what Inducement the Pri&s;oner had to undertake &s;o wicked and diabolical a Project.

<P>Before the Pri&s;oner enters upon his Defence, we conceive it will be proper to read to him &s;ome Pa&s;&s;ages out of &s;undry Books, that declare the Cu&s;toms and U&s;ages of the <HI>Church of Rome,</HI> to which his Practices among us, as declared by the Witne&s;&s;es, bear &s;ome Conformity: And unle&s;s he can make it appear, that his Practices are warran|ted by the U&s;age of any other Church, we conceive they will convince every Body, that he is a <HI>Prie&s;t</HI> of the <HI>Roman Church,</HI> and of no other.</P>

<P>Mr. SMITH &s;umm'd up the Evidence for the King, and addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to the Court and Jury, proceeded as followeth.</P>
<Q><P>THO' this Work of Darkne&s;s, in the Contrivance of a horrible Plot, to burn and de&s;troy this City&punc; has manife&s;ted it&s;elf in many <HI>blazing Effects,</HI> to the Terror and Amazement of us all; yet the &s;ecret Springs of this Mi&s;chief lay long concealed: This de&s;tructive Scene has opened by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">low Degrees: But now, Gentlemen, we have at length great Rea&s;on to conclude, that it took its ri&s;e from a <HI>Foreign Influence;</HI> and that it originally de|pended upon Cau&s;es, that we our&s;elves little thought of&punc; and which, perhaps, very few of the inferiour and &s;ubordinate Agents were intimately acquainted with.</P>
<P>The mon&s;trous Wickedne&s;s of this Plot would pro|bably among Strangers impeach its Credit; but if it be con&s;idered as the Contrivance of the <HI>publick Enemy,</HI> and the inhuman Dictate of a <HI>bloody Religion,</HI> the Wonder cea&s;es.</P>
<P>What more cruel and unnatural can be conceived, than what <HI>Rome</HI> has contrived; yea what more &s;avage and barbarous, than what Popery has attempted, and &s;ometimes executed, for the Extirpation of that, which the <HI>Papi&s;ts</HI> call <HI>Here&s;y?</HI> We need not go &s;o far from home as the <HI>Vallies of Piedmont,</HI> nor rake into the A&s;hes of the <HI>Antient Waldan&s;es</HI> and <HI>Albigen&s;es,</HI> for tragical In&s;tances of <HI>Popi&s;h Cruelty.</HI>&mdash;We need not remind you of the <HI>Ma&s;acre</HI> at <HI>Paris,</HI> nor the later De&s;olations in <HI>France,</HI> nor mention the <HI>horrible Slaughters</HI> of the <HI>Duke d' Alva</HI> in the <HI>Low Countries;</HI>&mdash;We need not recount the many Millions of Lives, that in remote Countries, and different Ages, have been &s;acrificed to the ROMAN IDOL; nor mea&s;ure out to you, that <HI>Ocean</HI> of foreign Blood with which the SCARLET WHORE hath made her&s;elf perpetually drunk.</P>
<P>No, Gentlemen, the <HI>Hi&s;tories</HI> of our Native Country will give us a formidable Idea of Popery; and inform us of the dete&s;table Principles of that <HI>Religion:</HI> Witne&s;s the Blood of <HI>our own Martyrs</HI> (who peri&s;hed in Pri&s;ons and at the Stake) without beginning higher than my <HI>Lord Cobham,</HI> and recounting their Number down to the End of <HI>Queen Mary'</HI>s Reign.&mdash;</P>

<P><HI>Gentlemen,</HI> If the Evidence you have heard is &s;ufficient to produce a general Conviction, that the late Fires in this City, and the murderous De&s;ign again&s;t its Inha|bitants, are the Effects of a <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> and <HI>Popi&s;h Plot&punc;</HI> then the <HI>My&s;tery</HI> of this <HI>Iniquity,</HI> which has &s;o much puzzled us, is unvailed, and our Admiration cea&s;es: All the Mi&s;|chiefs we have &s;uffered or been threatned with, are but a <HI>Sprout</HI> from that <HI>Evil Root,</HI> a &s;mall <HI>Stream</HI> from that over-flowing <HI>Fountain</HI> of De&s;truction, that has often de|l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">g'd the <HI>Earth</HI> with <HI>Slaughter and Blood,</HI> and &s;pread Ruin and De&s;olation far and wide.</P>
<P>We need not wonder to &s;ee a <HI>Popi&s;h Prie&s;t</HI> at this <HI>Bar,</HI> as a <HI>Prime Incendiary;</HI> nor think it &s;trange that an <HI>Engli&s;hman</HI> of that <HI>Religion</HI> and <HI>Character</HI> &s;hould be concerned in &s;o a Dete&s;table a De&s;ign.

<P>[Thence Mr. <HI>Smith</HI> proceeded to ob&s;erve on the &s;everal Parts of the Indictment, that were nece&s;&s;ary to be proved, in order to convict the Pri&s;oner; particularly, <HI>That Quack did burn his Maje&s;ty's Hou&s;e in the Fort; That the Pri&s;oner did coun&s;el, abet, procure and encourage the &s;aid Negro to commit that Felony.</HI> He ob&s;erved, that the <HI>three Witne&s;&s;es, Mary Burton, William Kane</HI> and <HI>Sarah Hugh&s;on,</HI> had fully prov'd the <HI>Fact.</HI> He reminded the <HI>Jury</HI> of the Caution that the Court had taken in Favour of the Pri&s;oner, &s;o that none of the <HI>three Witne&s;&s;es</HI> had heard the Te&s;timony, which was given by tho&s;e which had been examined before them; the Particulars of which Evidence is before-mentioned, and the Ob&s;ervations thereon, are here omitted, for Bravity Sake.]</P>
<P>And then concluded,</P>
<Q><P>Thus, <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> Nothing remains to be con&s;idered but the Credit of the Witne&s;&s;es. Indeed two of them have been concerned in the Plot; but we have proved them (under their pre&s;ent Circum&s;tances) to be legal Witne&s;&s;es.&mdash;They all give a con&s;i&s;tent Account of the Fact; and if you believe their Te&s;timony, we think, you can't avoid finding the <HI>Pri&s;oner Guilty.</HI> You have heard the <HI>Pri&s;oner's Defence;</HI> which, we conceive, does not affect the main Parts of the Accu&s;ation: <HI>He tells you that he mu&s;t have been a Lunatick to have &s;taid in Town after Notice, if he had been guilty:</HI> True; and in &s;ome Sen&s;e he mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed to have been a <HI>Lunatick</HI> from the Time he fir&s;t concerned him&s;elf in this <HI>dete&s;table Plot.</HI> Gentlemen, <HI>all Wickedne&s;s</HI> is in &s;ome &s;ort <HI>Mad|ne&s;s;</HI> and the Degrees of it ri&s;e in Proportion to the <HI>Enormity</HI> of the Crime; and when Men have filled up the Mea&s;ure of their Iniquity, and are ripe for Ruin, they are commonly cut off from all&punc; the Means of e&s;caping it.</P>
<P><HI>As to his rough Language to</HI> Sarah Hugh&s;on <HI>at</HI> Camp|bell'<HI>s, on which he lays &s;ome Stre&s;s;</HI> this may be accounted for, as proceeding from other Cau&s;es than his Innocence; either from a per&s;onal Re&s;entment of a &s;uppo&s;ed Injury to him&s;elf, who wanted the Room &s;he took up in that Hou&s;e; or perhaps with a De&s;ign to make a Shew that he never had been acquainted with her; for Prie&s;ts, he tells us, are <HI>very artful and cunning.</HI>&mdash;But be this how it will, we conceive it can't amount to a <HI>Di&s;proof</HI> of the main Charge again&s;t the <HI>Pri&s;oner.</HI></P>
<P><HI>As to what he alledges concerning</HI> Quack, Hugh&s;on <HI>and</HI> his Wife, <HI>and</HI> the Creature that died with them, <HI>no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> having accu&s;ed him;</HI> we think very little can be inferred from thence in his Favour: As to <HI>Quack,</HI> he accu&s;ed many in general Terms more than he particularly named; and indeed the Confe&s;&s;ion that <HI>Quack</HI> made was in the Hurries of Death, after he was fa&s;tened to the Stake. <HI>Hugh&s;on,</HI> his <HI>Wife,</HI> and <HI>the Creature</HI> that died with them, confe&s;&s;ed <HI>Nothing</HI> at all; therefore <HI>Nothing</HI> can be inferred from their not accu&s;ing the Pri&s;oner. It &s;eems &s;trange, that Mr. <HI>Ury</HI> could not give us the Name of <HI>that Crea|ture</HI> that died with <HI>Hugh&s;on and his Wife,</HI> &s;eeing as <HI>Mary Burton</HI> &s;ays, he was &s;o well acquainted with her as to have had the Liberty of undre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf in her Bed-Room.</P>
<P><HI>As to the Pri&s;oner's Appeal to God for his Innocence&punc; this we conceive witne&s;&s;es Nothing in his Favour, but rather again&s;t him;</HI> for we often find, that the <HI>Wickede&s;t of Men</HI> will attempt to cloak their <HI>Villainies</HI> with the &s;ame Practice, and <HI>good Men</HI> are ever &s;paring in their <HI>Appeals</HI> to <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ven,</HI> even in Ca&s;es where their <HI>Innocence</HI> is concerned.</P>

<LETTER>
<HEAD>The la&s;t Speech of JOHN URY.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Fellow Chri&s;tians,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I AM now going to &s;uffer a Death attended with Ignominy and Pain; but it is the Cup that my Heavenly Father has put into my Hand, and I drink it with Plea&s;ure; it is the Cro&s;s of my dear Redeemer, I bear it with Alacrity; knowing that all that live godly in <HI>Chri&s;t Je&s;us,</HI> mu&s;t &s;uffer Per&s;ecution; and we mu&s;t be made in &s;ome Degree Partakers of his Sufferings, before we can &s;hare in the Glories of his Re&s;urrection: For he went not up to Glory before he a&s;cended <HI>Mount Calvary;</HI> did not wear the Crown of Glory before the Crown of Thorns. And I am to appear before an awful and tremendous GOD, a Being of infinite Purity and unerring Ju&s;tice; a God who by no Means will clear the Guilty, that cannot be reconciled either to Sin or Sinners: Now this is the Being at who&s;e Bar I am to &s;tand; in the Pre&s;ence of this God, the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of Heaven and Earth, I lift up my Hands, and &s;olemnly prote&s;t, I am innocent of what is laid to my Charge: I appeal to the great God for my Non-knowledge of <HI>Hew&s;on,</HI> his Wife, or the Creature that was hanged with them; I never &s;aw them living, dying or dead; nor never had I any Knowledge or Confederacy with White or Black, as to any Plot: And, upon the Memorials of the Body and Blood of my deare&s;t Lord, in the Creatures of Bread and Wine, in which I have commemorated the Love of my dying Lord, I prote&s;t that the Witne&s;&s;es are perjured; I never knew the perjured Witne&s;&s;es but at my Trial. But for a Removal of all Scruples that may ari&s;e after my Death, I &s;hall give my Thoughts on &s;ome Points.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> I firmly believe and atte&s;t, That it is not in the Power of Man to forgive Sin; that it is the Prerogative only of the Great God to di&s;pen&s;e Pardon for Sin; and that tho&s;e who dare pretend to &s;uch a Power, do
<PB N="175" REF="005413_0183_10173B73F8ACFCC8">
in &s;ome Degree commit that great and unpardonable Sin, the Sin again&s;t the Holy Spirit; becau&s;e they pretend to that Power which their own Con&s;ciences proclaim to be a Lie.</P>
<P><HI>Again,</HI> I &s;olemnly atte&s;t and believe, That a Per&s;on having committed Crimes that have or might have proved hurtful or de&s;tructive to the Peace of Society, and does not di&s;cover the whole Scheme, and all the Per&s;ons concerned with them, cannot obtain Pardon from God: And it is not the taking any Oath or Oaths that ought to hinder him from confe&s;&s;ing his Guilt, and all that he knows about it; for &s;uch Obligations are not only &s;inful, but unpardonable, if not broken: Now a Per&s;on firmly believing this, and knowing that an eternal State of Happine&s;s or Mi&s;ery depends upon the Performance or Non-performance of the above mentioned Things, can not, will not triffle with &s;uch important Affairs.</P>
<P>I have no more to &s;ay by Way of clearing my Inno|cency, knowing that to a true chri&s;tian unprejudiced Mind, I mu&s;t appear guiltle&s;s; but however, I am not very &s;ollicitous about it. I rejoice, and it is now my Comfort (and that will &s;upport me and protect me from the Crowd of evil Spirits that I mu&s;t meet with in my Flight to the Region of Bli&s;s a&s;&s;igned me) that my Con&s;cience &s;peaks Peace to me.</P>
<P>Indeed, it may be &s;hocking to &s;ome &s;erious Chri&s;tians, that the holy God &s;hould &s;uffer Innocency to be &s;lain by the Hands of cruel and bloody Per&s;ons (I mean the Witne&s;&s;es who &s;wore again&s;t me at my Trial) indeed, there may be Rea&s;ons a&s;&s;igned for it, but as they may be liable to Objections, I decline them; and &s;hally only &s;ay, that this is one of the dark Providences of the great God, in his wi&s;e, ju&s;t and good Government of this lower World.</P>
<P>In fine, I depart this Wa&s;te, this howling Wilderne&s;s, with a Mind &s;erene, free from all Malice, with a forgiving Spirit, &s;o far as the Go&s;pel of my dear and only Re|deemer obliges and enjoins me to, hoping and praying, that JESUS, who alone is the Giver of Repentance, will convince, conquer and enlighten my Murderers Souls, that they may publickly confe&s;s their horrid Wickedne&s;s before God and the World, &s;o that their Souls may be &s;aved in the Day of the Lord JESUS.</P>
<P>And now a Word of Advice to you, Spectators: Behold me launching into Eternity; &s;eriou&s;ly, &s;olemnly view me, and a&s;k your&s;elves &s;everally, how &s;tands the Ca&s;e with me? die I mu&s;t: Am I prepared to meet my Lord, when the Midnight Cry is echoed forth? &s;hall I then have the Wedding-Garment on? Oh Sinners! triffle no longer; con&s;ider Life hangs on a Thread, her<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> To-day and gone To-morrow; for&s;ake your Sins e'er ye be for&s;aken forever: Hearken, now is God awfully calling you to repent, warning you by me his Mini&s;ter and Pri&s;oner, to embrace JESUS, to take, to lay hold on him for your alone Saviour, in order to e&s;cape the Wrath to come; no longer delay, &s;eeing the Summons may come before ye are aware, and you &s;tanding before the Bar of a God who is a con&s;uming Fire out of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, &s;hould be hurled, be doomed to that Place, <HI>where their Worm dies not, and their Fire is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> to be quenched.</HI><NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot"><HI>See</HI> Langhorn'<HI>s dying Speech, State Trials, ad Vol.</HI></NOTE></P>
</LETTER>
<P>NOTE, <HI>This Copy</HI> differs from <HI>that</HI> &s;uppo&s;ed to have been printed at <HI>Philadelphia</HI> &s;oon after <HI>Ury'</HI>s Execution, which perhaps might have been altered and corrected by some of his A&s;&s;ociates; as al&s;o <HI>that</HI> of his Defence made at his Trial, which was printed with it; for that in the fore-going Trial was taken from a Copy literally tran&s;cribed from one deliver'd in his own Hand Writing, without Points; it was therefore printed with <HI>Ury'</HI>s Mis-&s;pellings, and unpointed, that the Reader may have a Specimen of his Schollar&s;hip, and from thence conjecture, whether the Defence and dying Speech were of his own genuine Product.</P>
<P><HI>The following Account concerning this Per&s;on, comes from a Gentleman who had &s;everal Conver&s;ations with him between the Time of his Sentence and Execution, who &s;ays Ury informed him,</HI></P>
<Q><P>THAT his Father was Secretary to the South Sea Company, but died when the &s;aid <HI>Ury</HI> was young.</P>
<P>That after the Death of his Father he was taken Care of by a Gentleman who bore the Character of a Non-Juror, <HI>but who, he had &s;ince Rea&s;on to believe, was a Je&s;uit.</HI></P>
<P>That he was educated at two Univer&s;ities.&mdash;But what Univer&s;ities they were he did not care to tell me.</P>
<P>That afterwards he became a Non-juring Clergyman; and that the Head of their Society was one Dr. <HI>Clarke.</HI></P>
<P>That while in this Character, he was taken up and tried <HI>for writing a Book again&s;t the Government;</HI> of which he was found guilty: Upon this Account, a Chappal he had of his own, and which brought him in 50 <HI>l. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ter<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">. per Annum,</HI> was &s;eized into the Hands of the Government, and he him&s;elf e&s;caped with his Life, only through the Character and Intere&s;t of his Friends. Being thus reduced
<PB N="176" REF="005413_0184_10173B76F70E6FC8">
to difficult and di&s;graceful Circum&s;tances, he could not bear to &s;tay in a Place where he had once lived in Honour and Credit; and this occa&s;ion'd his Removal into <HI>America.</HI></P></Q>
<P>Says the Gentleman,</P>
<Q><P>I had a great Curio&s;ity to know how far this Account of him&s;elf was true; and he having often told me, that he was intimately acquainted with a Gentleman of di&s;tingui&s;h'd Worth and Character in <HI>London,</HI> with whom I had &s;ome Corre&s;pondence by Letters; I wrote to that Gentleman, de&s;iring, if he knew any Thing of this <HI>John Ury,</HI> that he would give me a particular Account of him and his Circum&s;tances:</P>
<P>In An&s;wer to my Reque&s;t, he informed me,</P>
<P>THAT <HI>John Ury'</HI>s Father was a Secretary in the South-Sea, but di&s;mi&s;&s;ed before the great Advance of it in 1720; &s;o that he had no Share in tho&s;e Gains. That when he died he left his Family in the utmo&s;t Di&s;tre&s;s and Poverty.&mdash;This <HI>John Ury</HI> had been <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of a Shop-Boy, to carry Me&s;&s;ages, but educated to no Bu&s;ine&s;s or Profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>His highe&s;t Ambition was to be a common Servant in a Family: He profe&s;s'd great Religion, went often to Wor&s;hip with the Di&s;&s;enters, but always communicated with the <HI>Church of England.</HI> He never heard of his writing again&s;t the Government, nor believed him capable of it, being without Education: At la&s;t, being di&s;ap|pointed in mo&s;t of his De&s;igns, he fell into Dictraction.&mdash;From which Time this Gentleman heard Nothing of him, till the melancholly News from <HI>America,</HI> which was about the Space of three years.</P></Q>

<HEAD>JOURNAL of the PROCEEDINGS again&s;t the Con&s;pirators at NEW-YORK: 1742.</HEAD>
<DIV3 TYPE="month">
<HEAD>JANUARY.</HEAD>
<P>UPON the Return of the Ve&s;&s;els that had tran&s;ported the Negro Con&s;pirators the la&s;t Summer, to various foreign Parts, many Particulars of Intelligence concerning the Con&s;piracy, which had dropt from tho&s;e Criminals in their Di&s;cour&s;e with the Captains, Pa&s;&s;engers and others, were brought hither; from which there was Rea&s;on to apprehend, that this City and People were not yet out of Danger from this Helli&s;h Confederacy, which had been &s;o wickedly and maliciou&s;ly formed again&s;t both; and con&s;idering the Hints the Negroes gave concerning <HI>the execrable Oath</HI> the Con|&s;pirators had engaged them&s;elves in; it &s;eemed probable that the like Attempts would be renewed, notwith&s;tanding the many Examples that had been made by Executions, and the Number of Slaves &s;ent out of the Province; for the Con&s;pirators impiou&s;ly looked upon the <HI>Oath</HI> to be &s;o &s;acred, that they thought <HI>(as no Doubt they were made to believe)</HI> that the eternal Welfare of their Souls depended upon their &s;trict Ob&s;ervance and Execution of it; <HI>for fear</HI> (as the <HI>Cant</HI> was, both of Whites and Blacks) that if they &s;hould reveal it, or de&s;i&s;t from the Execution of the Engagements they were laid under by it, <HI>they &s;hould wrong their own Souls.</HI></P>
<P>Many Cabals of Negroes al&s;o had been di&s;covered in diver&s;e Parts of the Country, &s;ince the Execution and Tran&s;portation of the Con&s;pirators, which ju&s;tly cau&s;ed Su&s;picion, that the &s;ame villainous Scheme was yet in Agi|tation; particularly in <HI>Queen's County,</HI> on <HI>Na&s;&s;au,</HI> alias <HI>Long-I&s;land;</HI> the Negroes had there formed them&s;elves into a Company about Chri&s;tma&s;s la&s;t, by Way of Play or Diver&s;ion (as they would have had it thought) had mu&s;tered and trained with the <HI>borrowed</HI> Arms and Accoutrements of their Ma&s;ters, (or we would rather &s;uppo&s;e, <HI>&s;urreptitiou&s;ly</HI> obtained) Information whereof having been given to His Honour the Lieutenant Governor, he immediately ordered his Maje&s;ty's Attorney General to write to the Ju&s;tices of that County about it, and to expo&s;tulate with them upon the Occa&s;ion, and direct them to inflict due Puni&s;hment on the Offenders.</P>
<P>And the Negroes were accordingly cha&s;ti&s;ed for this daring Piece of In&s;olence.</P>
<P>There having al&s;o been Reports about the &s;ame Time, of &s;everal pretended Prophecies of Negroes, <HI>That</HI> Charles-Town <HI>in</HI> South-Carolina, <HI>and the City of</HI> New-York, <HI>were to be burnt down on the Twenty fifth of</HI> March <HI>next;</HI> the&s;e Circum&s;tances con&s;idered, and added to what had been wrote by General <HI>Oglethorpe,</HI> as before mentioned, <HI>That the declared Enemies had &s;ecretly con&s;pired to burn down and de&s;troy all his Maje&s;ty's Magazines in North-America;</HI> and con&s;idering what a Scene of mon&s;trous Iniquity had been di&s;covered the la&s;t Summer, tending to this dete&s;table Pur|po&s;e; there &s;eemed to be too much Rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect, that the&s;e Sort of Divinations were founded upon a Con&s;piracy &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ting, as well as in Part executed, both here and in <HI>South-Carolina.</HI></P>
<P>The Lieutenant Governor therefore thought it nece&s;&s;ary to put the People upon their Guard, by writing circular Letters to the Magi&s;trates of every City, Borough and County within this Government.</P>
<P>The following Letter was &s;ent directed to the Mayor, Recorder and Aldermen of this City.</P>

<P>AFTER the providential Di&s;covery of the late mo&s;t execrable Con&s;piracy, and the helli&s;h and barbarous De&s;igns of a perver&s;e and blood-thir&s;ty People, for the Ruin and De&s;truction of the whole Province, and the Inhabitants thereof; and that even at a Time when all Things were ripe for Execution, and the intended De&s;o|lation was &s;o nigh at Hand; one would think our &s;ignal Pre&s;ervation could never be forgot; and that no one could be &s;o blind to him&s;elf, and regardle&s;s of his future Safety, as to &s;uffer the Negroes to have private or publick Meetings and Caballings together; thereby giving them an Opportunity of forming new De&s;igns, or another Con&s;piracy; knowing them to be a People whom no Example can reclaim, no Puni&s;hment deter, or Lenitives

appea&s;e; yet from the many undoubted Informations I have received from diver&s;e Parts of the Country, the In&s;olence of the Negroes is as great, if not greater, than ever; and they are not only &s;uffered to have private, but even publick Meetings, in great Numbers, without the lea&s;t Mole&s;tation or Interruption from the Magi&s;trates, and in Defiance of tho&s;e Laws they ought to be the Protectors of, and &s;ee put in due Execution; thereby &s;uffering them and them&s;elves to be trampled on and in&s;ulted, to the endangering the Peace of the Province: If this Practice continues, what may we not fear? For I doubt there are too many yet remaining among us who were of the late Con&s;piracy; <HI>and though we have felled the Tree, I fear it is not entirely rooted up.</HI> I mu&s;t therefore require you, as you value the Peace and Safety of this City and Province, and your own Pre&s;ervation; and you are hereby &s;trictly charged and required, to &s;ee the Laws again&s;t Negroes duly and punctually executed; &s;uffering no Meetings of them within your City and County and &s;everal Di&s;tricts: And, in order that the &s;ame may be more effectually done, I do hereby direct you to charge all the Con&s;tables and other Officers, to be diligent in their Duty, and that they apprehend and bring before you, or &s;ome of you, all and every one &s;o offending; as al&s;o all &s;uch Per&s;on and Per&s;ons as &s;hall be found to harbour Negroes, confederate or con&s;ort with them, that they may be proceeded again&s;t according to Law.

<P>THIS Morning about &s;ix o'Clock, it was providentially di&s;covered, that &s;ome Fire had been put in the Gutter of a Shed adjoining to the Hou&s;e where <HI>Walter Hyer</HI> lived, next the Fence of the Old Dutch Church-Yard: The Wind blowing very hard at N. and the Gutter lying N. and S. &s;ome of the Coals were blown into the Street; which were accidentally di&s;cerned by one <HI>Hendricks&punc;</HI> a Carpenter, who was opening the Window-Shutters of a new Hou&s;e he was about fini&s;hing, fronting the End of the Street, in order to go to work; whereupon he immediately went to <HI>Hyer's</HI> Hou&s;e, and called him out of Bed; and they found &s;ome live Coals in the Gutter next the Shed towards the Church-Yard, and likewi&s;e a Brand's-End, or the Bark of a Brand's-End, on the other Side of the Hou&s;e next <HI>Rat&s;ey'</HI>s: The Mayor being acquainted herewith, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ummoned the Magi&s;trates to meet his Morning at the City-Hall, to con&s;ult what Steps to take, in order to di&s;|cover the Incendiaries&punc; And the Magi&s;trates being accor|dingly met, it was propo&s;ed by one of them, as no particular Per&s;on was &s;u&s;pected, that they &s;hould all go and view the Hou&s;e and enquire what Negroes were in the Neighbour|hood, and their Characters whereby the mo&s;t Su&s;picious might <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> laid hold of and examined; 'twas thought mo&s;t likely; that by this Method the Truth might chance to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">olt cut&punc; They we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t accordingly and it luckily hap|pened, that the fir&s;t Per&s;on's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> enquired after, was the Widow <HI>Bradt&punc;</HI> She kept a Bake-hou&s;e near by, and her

Yard-ran along the Rear of <HI>Hyer'</HI>s and <HI>Rat&s;ey'</HI>s Hou&s;es, up to the Church Yard Fence, where were an Heap of Oy&s;ter Shells lying &s;o near <HI>Hyer'</HI>s Gutter, that a middle-&s;iz'd Man might ea&s;ily &s;tep up and put Fire in the Gutter, at the North End of it, and from the &s;ame Yard as ea&s;ily throw a Brand's End on the other Side of the Hou&s;e next <HI>Rat&s;ey'</HI>s: Upon the Enquiry, it was &s;aid that the Widow <HI>Bradt</HI> had only one Negro, <HI>a Sort of a &s;imple half-witted Boy&punc;</HI> but however he was ordered to be brought forth; and he ap|peared upon View to be a lu&s;ly well-&s;et Fellow, of Man's Growth, and was afterwards judged (by tho&s;e that knew him be&s;t, and had brought him into the Country) to be One or Two and Twenty Years old; his natural Counte|nance was none of the plea&s;ante&s;t; but his Appearance upon this Occa&s;ion betokened Symptoms of Guilt: It was thought that Baker's Servants, from the Nature of their Bu&s;ine&s;s, mu&s;t be up early, and have always a Command of Fire, which admini&s;tred &s;ome Colour of Su&s;picion, which the Looks of the Fellow very much heighten'd; and there|fore he was without Ceremony committed, in order for Examination in the Afternoon, and likewi&s;e &s;ome other Negroes of the Neighbourhood, who were afterwards di&s;charged.</P>
<P>The Magi&s;trates being met at three o'Clock in the Afternoon, and <HI>Tom</HI> a&s;ked, how he came to put the Fire to <HI>Hyer'</HI>s Hou&s;e&punc; and who advi&s;ed and a&s;&s;i&s;ted him in it? he directly owned, that he put the Fire in the Gutter him|&s;elf: And being then very particularly examined, his Confe&s;&s;ion was taken down in Writing, in the Pre&s;ence of the Ju&s;tices, and by them &s;igned.</P>

<P>THE Ju&s;tices being met a fourth Time, in order to endeavour to pry further into this My&s;tery of Iniquity, by examining <HI>Tom</HI> once more; for as to what had been drawn from him hitherto one could not give entire Credit, as the Reader may conclude, excepting as to his being the In&s;trument of putting the Fire; and it being intimated by one of the Magi&s;trates, that <HI>Tom'</HI>s Mi&s;tre&s;s had a <HI>&s;trong</HI> Imagination (one might venture to &s;ay a <HI>&s;trange</HI> One) that &s;he and her Son, if the Magi&s;trates would permit their Attendance, could prevail upon their Negro to &s;peak the whole Truth. As there were many of us, there was Difference in Opinions upon this Matter. However, at length it was ruled, that they &s;hould be admitted, and were &s;ent for accordingly. Upon their Appearance, <HI>Tom</HI> was admoni&s;hed to tell the whole Truth, how it was concerning this Matter; and he declared him&s;elf at fir&s;t to the same Purpo&s;e as to the Negroes he before accu&s;ed, and as to the &s;ame Matter and Sub&s;tance with his Examinations before &s;et forth; but in the Clo&s;e, as there was great Doubt made of his Veracity, being &s;trenuou&s;ly urged by &s;ome of the Magi&s;trates, and his Ma&s;ter and Mi&s;tre&s;s, <Q>to be &s;ure that he &s;poke nothing but the Truth;</Q> and being a&s;ked, whether he was &s;ure that what he had &s;aid as to the&s;e Negroes was the Truth? he thereupon recanted, and declared what he had before related concerning the Negroes he had accu&s;ed, were all Lies; and took the Whole upon him&s;elf.

<P>WILLIAM SMITH, <ABBR>E&s;q;</ABBR> having been appointed by the Ju&s;tices, Council and Pro&s;ecutor for the King, he delivered into Court Articles of Accu&s;ation again&s;t the Pri&s;oner.</P>
<P>Before the Articles were read, the Freeholders were &s;worn, well and truly to try and judge as directed by the Act of A&s;&s;embly; and the Recorder warned the Pri&s;oner in Favour of Life, that he need not plead <HI>Guilty</HI> to any of the Articles, but neverthele&s;s, that his &s;everal Confe&s;&s;ions being read to the Court, would amount to full Proof, &s;o far as they affected him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Then the Articles were read, and were as followeth,</P>
<Q><P><HI>Tom,</HI> a Negro Man Slave belonging to <HI>Divertie Bradt</HI> of the &s;aid City, Widow, &s;tands charged and accu&s;ed,</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> For that he the &s;aid <HI>Tom,</HI> on Sunday the &s;eventh Day of <HI>February</HI> la&s;t pa&s;t, at the Dock Ward of this City, did con&s;pire with <HI>Jack,</HI> a Negro Man Slave belonging to <HI>Ja&s;per Farmer, Michael,</HI> a Negro Man Slave belonging to <HI>Samuel Dun&s;combe, Peter,</HI> a Negro Man Slave belonging to <HI>John Tudor,</HI> and <HI>Rob,</HI> a Negro Man Slave belonging to <HI>Charles Crooke,</HI> of this City, and diver&s;e other Negro Slaves unknown, to kill and murder the &s;aid <HI>Divertie Bradt&punc; Baffie Vandewater,</HI> and other his Maje&s;ty's liege People within the City of <HI>New-York.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> For that he the &s;aid <HI>Tom,</HI> on Monday the fifteenth Day of <HI>February</HI> la&s;t pa&s;t, did willfully put Fire to and burn the Shed or Outhou&s;e of <HI>Baffie Vandewater,</HI> and the Hou&s;e of <HI>Andrew Bradford</HI> and <HI>Cornelia</HI> his Wife, in the Dock Ward of the &s;ame City.</P>
<P><PB N="184" REF="005413_0192_10170FE7ABF05E08">
<HI>Thirdly,</HI> For that he the &s;aid <HI>Tom,</HI> did on the fifteenth Day of <HI>February</HI> la&s;t pa&s;t, at the City and Ward afore|&s;aid, attempt to kill and murder <HI>Divertie Bradt</HI> and <HI>Baffie Vandewater,</HI> of this City, by &s;etting Fire to their Hou&s;es, and burning them in the &s;ame.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> That he the &s;aid <HI>Tom,</HI> on the fifteenth Day <HI>February</HI> la&s;t pa&s;t, at the City and Ward afore&s;aid, did attempt to burn the Out-hou&s;e of the &s;aid <HI>Divertie Bradt</HI> and the Dwelling-Hou&s;es of <HI>Baffie Vandewater,</HI> and <HI>Andrew Bradford</HI> and <HI>Cornelia</HI> his Wife, &s;ituate in the &s;ame Ward, and to burn the whole Town and City of <HI>New-York.</HI></P></Q>
<P>To the Fir&s;t Article the Pri&s;oner pleaded, <HI>Not Guilty.</HI></P>
<P>To the Second, <HI>Guilty.</HI></P>
<P>To the Third, <HI>Not Guilty.</HI></P>
<P>As the Pri&s;oner had pleaded Guilty to the Second Article, the Court were of Opinion to proceed to Judgment upon that; but Mr. <HI>Smith</HI> moved, that before they proceeded, &s;ome Witne&s;&s;es might be &s;worn, and the Criminal's &s;everal Examinations and Confe&s;&s;ions taken by the Ju&s;tices, as before &s;et forth, might be read for their further Informa|tion concerning his Guilt, and for the greater Satisfaction of the Court and Audience.</P>
<P>And here it may not be improper to ob&s;erve, that the Pri&s;oner di&s;tingui&s;hed and pleaded to the three &s;everal Articles directly, without He&s;itation; which &s;eems to be a further Argument that he had more Sen&s;e than &s;ome People were willing to allow him.</P>
<P>Proclamations for Silence and Witne&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>WITNESSES for the KING &s;worn, HENDRICKS and HYER.</P>
<P><HI>HENDRICKS</HI> &s;aid, <Q>he di&s;covered the Fire to fall out of the Gutter as he was looking from a Window into the Street; and that thereupon he went and knocked at <HI>Hyer'</HI>s Door, and called him out of Bed, and they &s;earched and found Coals on each Side of the Hou&s;e; &s;ome in the Gutter next the Shed, towards the Church-Yard, and &s;ome on the Side next <HI>Rat&s;ey'</HI>s Hou&s;e.</Q></P>
<P><HI>HYER</HI> &s;aid, <Q>that the Gutter next the Church-Yard was burnt black in the Spot, or Part of the Gutter, where he found the Coals lying.</Q></P>
<P>The Criminal's Confe&s;&s;ions read as before &s;et forth.</P>
<P>And the Ju&s;tices further informed the Court, that the Criminal at his la&s;t Examination, though he at the Begin|ning of it per&s;i&s;ted in the &s;ame Story as to his Accu&s;ation of <HI>Jack (Farmar's)</HI> prompting and propo&s;ing to him to put the Fire, &amp;<HI>c.</HI> and as to the other Negroes pre&s;ent at the two Meetings at <HI>Farmar'</HI>s Hou&s;e, advi&s;ing and threat|ning him if he did not, &amp;<HI>c.</HI> yet in the Clo&s;e he declared for Truth, that all he had &s;aid relating to them, were Lies, and that he put the Fire of his own Head; and being a&s;k'd, why he did it, and how he came to do &s;o? he an&s;wered, he could not help doing it. And being a&s;ked by the Court, whether he did not make &s;uch Confe&s;&s;ions as had been then ju&s;t read? he an&s;wered, <HI>Yes.</HI> He was then bid to tell the &s;ame Story over again as he had told to the Ju&s;tices at the three fir&s;t Examinations, and likewi&s;e at the fir&s;t Part of the fourth and la&s;t; and he repeated the &s;ame over again, as it were in the &s;ame Words: And when he had done, being a&s;ked, whether what he had then &s;aid as to the other Negroes was true? he an&s;wered, <HI>No, 'twas all Lies;</HI> and took all again upon him&s;elf, and owned his Recantation to be the Truth.</P>
<P>The Audience being ordered to withdraw, the Pri&s;oner taken from the Bar, and the Court&punc;Room cleared; the Recorder advi&s;ed with the Ju&s;tices and Freeholders; and having taken their Opinions, which were unanimous upon that Occa&s;ion, the Doors were ordered to be opened, and the Pri&s;oner brought back; and being accordingly brought back, the Recorder proceeded to Admonition and Sentence, as followeth:</P>
<Q><P>YOU <HI>Tom,</HI> the Criminal at the Bar, hearken to what is now to be &s;aid to you.</P>
<P>You &s;tand convicted of willfully putting Fire to and burning the Shed or Out-hou&s;e of <HI>Baffie Vandewater</HI><NOTE N="(e)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Laid in her Name in the Articles of Accu&s;ation, being Owner of the Hou&s;e;</HI> Walter Hyer <HI>Tenant</HI></NOTE> within this City. The Evidence of your Guilt has &s;tood principally upon your own Confe&s;&s;ion before your Trial; which you now confirm by your Plea: And indeed this is the &s;tronge&s;t Proof, the highe&s;t Conviction that can be: For this &s;ingle Fact you de&s;erve Death: And though the Court proceeds to give Judgment again&s;t you upon this Article; yet your Offence is of a com|plicated Nature, <HI>i. e.</HI> con&s;i&s;ts of many Particulars, all tending to one and the &s;ame mon&s;trous and execrable Purpo&s;e; the Murdering the Inhabitants of this City.</P>
<P><PB N="185" REF="005413_0193_10173B909190F6A8">
The helli&s;h Scheme you have engaged in, as you have confe&s;&s;ed before the Magi&s;trates over and over again (I think no le&s;s than four &s;everal Times) was, to &s;et <HI>Walter Hyer'</HI>s Hou&s;e on fire, and (as you concluded and propo&s;ed) that would con&s;equently &s;et the next Hou&s;e (<HI>Rat&s;ey'</HI>s) on fire, and that would &s;et your Mi&s;tre&s;s's on fire, and burn your Mi&s;tre&s;s in it; and then that would burn the whole Town: Then the <HI>Long-I&s;land</HI> Negroes were to come over to the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Negroes here&punc; and they, in Conjunction, were to murder all the White People of this City: And, in order that your malicious helli&s;h Purpo&s;es might effectually take Place, the Fire was to be put, as it actually was, when the Wind blew hard, that in all Probability, any Attempts made to extingui&s;h the Flames, might be in vain.</P>
<P>And &s;uch a tru&s;ty Agent have you been in the Devil's Service, that in pro&s;ecution of this infernal Con&s;piracy, you did actually take the fir&s;t Step propo&s;ed, in order to accompli&s;h this diabolical Purpo&s;e, by putting Fire to <HI>Hyer'</HI>s Hou&s;e on both Sides of it.</P>
<P>All this that I have &s;aid, you have confe&s;&s;ed over and over again; and in this we mu&s;t take your Word: It was a merciful Act of Providence that your De&s;igns were timely prevented, that you were committed upon Su&s;picion only, and that thereupon the Truth has thus bolted out from you.</P>
<P>It was rumoured without Doors, that you were an half-witted Fellow (Boy I think they called you, though you are &s;aid to be Two or Three and Twenty Years old) and indeed one would think hardly any Body but arrant Fools, or Mad-Folks, would engage in &s;uch chimerical, wicked, villainous and dangerous Projects, which mu&s;t mo&s;t probably end in the Confu&s;ion, and De&s;truction, of the Wretches concerned; as you found by woful Experi|ence in the many Examples of tho&s;e mi&s;erable Creatures of your Colour that expired in Flames, and at the Gallows, the la&s;t Summer, for the like dete&s;table Offen|ces: And yet &s;o hardened and &s;tupified are ye in Villainy, that no Examples though ever &s;o &s;evere, no Terrors of Puni&s;hment can affright ye; but ye will even defie the Gallows and commit your Bodies to the Flames, rather than not ri&s;que the Chance of gratifying, your &s;avage, cruel, and in&s;atiable Thir&s;t for Blood.</P>
<P>But neverthele&s;s, to convince one that you are not that half-witted Fellow, as &s;ome would repre&s;ent you, you &s;hewed &s;ome Cunning (as it &s;hould &s;eem you thought) after your Commitment, in providing for your own Safety and Pre&s;ervation, by laying this Scheme upon and accu&s;ing others, as having prompted you to this Mi&s;chief, hoping thereby, as it mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed, to be admitted an Evidence again&s;t them, and &s;o &s;ave your own Life: This was a Thought too deep for a Fool, or half-witted Fellow: And indeed from my Ob&s;ervation of you, during the Cour&s;e of your &s;everal Examinations, I could di&s;cover no Rea&s;on for an In&s;inuation, that you had le&s;s Sen&s;e than tho&s;e of the common Rank of Negroes, but that your Qualifications for Mi&s;chief are inferior to none of them; That you have Sen&s;e enough to di&s;tingui&s;h between Good and Evil; that your own Con&s;cience could direct you what was fit and proper to be done, and what not; you your&s;elf, by your own Confe&s;&s;ions have given mo&s;t convincing Proofs; for when (as you all along &s;aid, till the la&s;t Time when you recanted and declared that what you had told concerning the other Negroes was all Lies, I &s;ay, as you told the Story) <HI>Jack (Farmar's)</HI> in order to try whether you were fit for the Undertaking, &s;aid to you, <HI>Tom your Mi&s;tre&s;s is cro&s;s to you, you mu&s;t &s;et fire to the Offdackye, then that will burn</HI> Hyer'<HI>s Hou&s;e, that will burn</HI> Rat&s;ey'<HI>s Hou&s;e, then that will burn your Mi&s;tre&s;s's Hou&s;e, and burn your Mi&s;tre&s;s in it:</HI> Your An&s;wer to <HI>Jack</HI> upon this Propo&s;al was, <HI>No, my Mi&s;tre&s;s no cro&s;s to me, my Mi&s;tre&s;s good enough, what &s;hould I &s;et Fire for? you may do it your&s;elf;</HI> or Words to that Effect: That thereupon <HI>Jack</HI> in&s;i&s;ted, that you &s;hould &s;et fire, and the Rea&s;on why you at la&s;t agreed to do it, was becau&s;e, you &s;aid, <HI>Jack threatned he would poi&s;on you if you did not.</HI> This is what we call natural Rea&s;on, and &s;hews &s;uch a Mea&s;ure of it, or there is &s;uch a Chain of Con&s;equences drawn by it, that &s;uppo&s;ing it to be your own Scheme (as you now take all upon your &s;elf) you can be no Fool, or half-witted Fellow; and if it was the Scheme of others propo&s;ed to your&s;elf, your very Repetition of it, your telling that Story as you have done &s;o often over and over again, almo&s;t in the &s;ame Words, &s;hews that you don't want Under&s;tanding; but that you have made a very bad U&s;e of it, and acted again&s;t that Light, which God Almighty has given you to employ to better Purpo&s;es: So that here, I &s;ay, in the&s;e In&s;tances of the very Propo&s;al and An&s;wer, you give convincing Proof, that you were con&s;cious, <HI>i.e.</HI> that you your&s;elf was &s;en&s;ible and knew, that what you was going to attempt was wrong, was wicked, and what you ought not to do: Whether <HI>Jack (Farmar's)</HI> was the Per&s;on that propo&s;ed the Thing to you, we cannot tell; but that &s;omebody did, and that you did not do it alto|gether of your own Head, I am fully per&s;uaded&punc; But if no one but the Devil and you contrived it; then &s;o much mu&s;t be drawn from it, as is &s;ufficient to &s;hew, that you acted again&s;t the Light of your own Con&s;cience, your own Rea&s;on, by your own Way of arguing, and <HI>out of your own Mouth you are judged.</HI> How you came at la&s;t to withdraw your Accu&s;ation again&s;t tho&s;e Negroes, you

<P>And &s;ince Ju&s;tice has at la&s;t overtaken you, I &s;hall in Compa&s;&s;ion to your poor Soul, which is in the utmo&s;t, the greate&s;t Danger of being forever mi&s;erable, give you a Word of Advice. in order to prevail upon you to make u&s;e of tho&s;e few Moments you have to remain in this World, to the be&s;t Advantage; for be not deceived, there is another World after this, and there is a God above who has a clear View of all your Actions, and <HI>knows the very Secrets of your Hearts,</HI> and will require at your Hands according to that Degree of Rea&s;on which he has given you&punc; And though your Body be con&s;umed in the Flames here on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">arth (a Puni&s;hment of &s;hort Continuance) yet your Soul will never dye; that mu&s;t &s;urvive the Body, either to be forever happy, or for|ever mi&s;erable, according to your Actions here.</P>
<P>What a horrible &s;hocking Expectation mu&s;t yours be then! You that would murder and de&s;troy without Mercy, nay without Provocation; what rea&s;onable Hopes can you entertain of Mercy from the Hands of the God of Ju&s;tice, who will reward every Man according to his Works? They that have done Good &s;hall be for|ever happy; they that have done Evil &s;hall be ca&s;t into a Sea of Fire and Brim&s;tone, to be forever tormented with the Devil and his accur&s;ed Spirits, from whence there will be no returning, no coming out again, but there will be bitter weeping and wailing, and gna&s;hing of Teeth, Time without End.</P>
<P>Now to avoid this dreadful everla&s;ting Puni&s;hment, the only Method for you to take, is to make the be&s;t U&s;e of the Time allowed you between this and your Execu|tion, by bringing your&s;elf to a due Sen&s;e of your Guilt, your heinous crying Sins; truly to repent you of, and be heartily &s;orry for your Wickedne&s;s, and earne&s;tly to pray to God Almighty for Forgivene&s;s: And this is not all; but that your Repentance may be &s;incere, you mu&s;t make that little Amends which is in your Power, towards us you have de&s;igned, and con&s;pired to murder and de&s;troy, by di&s;covering all tho&s;e Per&s;ons whom you know to be any Ways engaged, or concerned in this helli&s;h Plot, that you may thereby prevent all further Mi&s;chief. Upon the&s;e Conditions only can you have any rea&s;onable or well-grounded Hope or Expectation of the Salvation of your Soul, and of avoiding that dread|ful eternal Puni&s;hment, again&s;t which I have forewarned you.</P>
<P>And now it were but ju&s;t, that the &s;ame Mi&s;chief which you intended for others &s;hould fall upon your own Pate; but the Court has had &s;ome Regard to your Confe&s;&s;ion, as you acknowledged your Guilt upon your.

<HEAD>THE CONCLUSION:</HEAD>
<P>BY the Cour&s;e of the Evidence, it appears. That a De&s;ign was conceived to de&s;troy this City by Fire, and ma&s;&s;acre the Inhabitants: That Fire was to be put to &s;everal Quarters of the Town, at one and the &s;ame Time: That the <HI>Engli&s;h Church</HI> was to be &s;et on Fire, at a Time when 'twas mo&s;t likely there would be the fulle&s;t Congregation, and the Avenues from the Church were to be guarded by the&s;e Ruffians&punc; in order to butcher tho&s;e that &s;hould attempt to e&s;cape the Flames: This Part of the Scheme, it &s;eems, <HI>Ury</HI> the <HI>Prie&s;t,</HI> had particularly at Heart.&mdash;The Winds were con&s;ulted which would be mo&s;t proper to attempt the Fires with: They were to begin at the Ea&s;t End of the Town with a &s;trong Ea&s;terly Wind, which (as it was projected) according to the Cour&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> Situation, would probably de&s;troy the whole Town; but the King's <HI>Fort</HI> was <HI>fir&s;t</HI> to be burnt, becau&s;e mo&s;t likely to annoy the&s;e <HI>Furies,</HI> when their helli&s;h Devices were putting in Execution The Negro Confederates were each of them to &s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> Fire to his Ma&s;ter's Hou&s;e, and proceed to the A&s;&s;a&s;&s;inating their re&s;pective Ma&s;ters and Families; and the&s;e Fires were calculated for the Night&mdash;<HI>St. Patrick's</HI> Night was the Time appointed. Accordingly we find, as a Proof that they were in earne&s;t, the Attempt upon the <HI>Fort</HI> was made on <HI>St. Patrick's Night,</HI> tho' through the Providence of GOD, the Fire did not take Effect <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the next Day at Noon, when the Villain who fir&s;t put it, had renewed his Effort, by blowing up the &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">me Brand that he had placed for the Purpo&s;e the Night before.<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot"><HI>See the Note upon</HI> Quack'<HI>s Confe&s;&s;ion at the Stake, pag.</HI> 46. <HI>letter p.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>If&punc; it be con&s;idered, that many of the <HI>Iri&s;h Catholicks,</HI> unknown to the Captain<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, Runagates, or perhaps purpo&s;ely <HI>&s;ent over,</HI> had been enli&s;ted in &s;ome of the Independent Companies po&s;ted here, &s;ome whereof were detected of being confederated with the Con&s;pirators; they could not have pitch'd upon a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">tter Sea&s;on for perpetrating their bloody Purpo&s;es; for on this Night, according to Cu&s;tom, their Commemoration of their Saint, might be mo&s;t likely to excite in tho&s;e of the infernal League, Boldne&s;s and Re&s;olution, for the Execution of this horrible Enterprize, and others innocently partaking of their Jollity, might in &s;uch an Event, be thereby incapacitated for Service; &s;o that according to this Device, all (it might &s;eem probable to them) would lie at their Mercy. But the Fire at the <HI>Fort</HI> happening in the Day, contrary to the Purpo&s;e of the Con|&s;pirators, and the Town having been much alarmed at the Misfortune, tho' not apprehending the Treachery; yet, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> military Watch being kept all the Night following, the Villains were thereat &s;omewhat intimidated, and &s;topt their Progre&s;s for a While: Neverthele&s;s, from the nightly Cabals of the Con&s;pirators, at <HI>Hugh&s;on's,</HI> and the Encouragement given by <HI>Ury</HI> the <HI>Prie&s;t,</HI> the Night after the Fort burnt, who told them, <HI>Now God had pro&s;pered them in the Beginning, in burning the</HI> Fort, <HI>they need not fear; we mu&s;t be re&s;olute and proceed in the Work, and no doubt God will pro&s;per us in all;</HI> execrable Wretch! From hence they took Courage again, and it was re&s;olved among&s;t them, that they &s;hould proceed. Accordingly after one Week had pa&s;&s;ed, they did, we &s;ee, &s;et Fire to &s;everal Hou&s;es within the Compa&s;s of a Fort|night, &s;ometimes many in a Day, undi&s;covered; and made &s;everal other Attempts in which they were fru&s;trated, 'till at length &s;ome <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Prize Negroes having been &s;eized and committed upon Su&s;picion, a Stop was put to their Career. But more than a Fortnight pa&s;s'd after the la&s;t of the&s;e Fires, before the lea&s;t Intimation was given touching the Occa&s;ion of them, that they were the Effects of a dia|bolical Con&s;piracy; 'til <HI>Mary Burton,</HI> Servant to <HI>John Hugh&s;on,</HI> was brought before the <HI>Grand Jury,</HI> as a Witne&s;s to a different Matter, concerning which &s;he had te&s;tified before the Magi&s;trates; &s;he at fir&s;t refu&s;ing to be &s;worn to give her Evidence in that Ca&s;e to the Grand Jury, at length rather than go to J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">l &s;ubmitted, but withal bolted out, that &s;he would give no Evidence <HI>concerning the Fires:</HI> This Hint afforded &s;ufficient Handle to the Gentlemen of the Grand Jury, to exert their Diligence in &s;ifting out her Meaning, and to prevail with her to di&s;clo&s;e the Secret; which, after much Entreaty and Per&s;ua&s;ion, they effected, tho' at the &s;ame Time, the Girl di&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">urthen'd her&s;elf with apparent Dread and great Unwillingne&s;s, from the Apprehen&s;ion of the Danger &s;he &s;hould be in of being murdered by the Con|&s;pirators for the Di&s;covery, as &s;he afterwards declared.</P>
<P><PB N="194" REF="005413_0202_10173BAB0A0F41A0">
By the Evidence of this Girl, it appears, that her Ma&s;ter <HI>Hugh&s;on</HI> was a Principal, Engine, Agent and In&s;tigator of the&s;e Deeds of Darkne&s;s among&s;t the Slaves here, ever &s;ince &s;he came into his Service; and by the Evidence of others, Whites and Blacks, it al&s;o appears, that he having kept a publick Hou&s;e for &s;ome Years, had long &s;ince made it a Practice to entertain Numbers of Negroes, often 20, 30, 40 or 50 at a Time, and by Degrees deluded them to en|gage in the Con&s;piracy, upon his Promi&s;es, that they &s;hould all be Freemen, and that other fine Things &s;hould be done for them; that upon their con&s;enting, <HI>Hugh&s;on</HI> always bound them to their Engagements by <HI>horrible Oaths,</HI> not only to perform what they undertook to do, <HI>viz.</HI> to <HI>burn and ma&s;|&s;acre,</HI> but al&s;o to keep <HI>all &s;ecret,</HI> though they were to die for it; that the&s;e Oaths were reiterated at all future Meetings in order to confirm them; and for their Encouragement, <HI>Hugh&s;on</HI> often &s;wore him&s;elf over again, and had &s;worn his Wife and Daughter into the Confederacy al&s;o That <HI>Hugh&s;on</HI> provided Arms and Gunpowder, further to convince the&s;e deluded Wretches, how much he was in earne&s;t; but the Butchery to be executed by the Negroes after they had &s;et Fire to their Ma&s;ters Hou&s;es, was calculated to be done with Knives; for tho&s;e Weapons, it &s;eems they judged, would make no Noi&s;e: This the whole Current of Negro Evidence agrees in, and 'tis corroborated by Whites.&mdash;That a Knife de&s;igned for this Purpo&s;e was actually found in the Che&s;t of one of the Negro Con&s;pirators, and mo&s;t others of them were provided with Knives.</P>
<P>That <HI>Hugh&s;on</HI> employed &s;ome of the Head Negroes as Agents under him, to decoy other Negroes, and their In|&s;tructions were not to open the Con&s;piracy to any but <HI>tho&s;e</HI> that were of their <HI>own</HI> Country (as they are brought from different Parts of <HI>Africa,</HI> and might be &s;uppos'd be&s;t to know the Temper and Di&s;po&s;ition of each other) and when they brought a Convert to <HI>Hugh&s;on,</HI> or one likely to become &s;uch, <HI>Hugh&s;on</HI> always gave them Drams 'til they were intoxicated, and then the Con&s;piracy was propo&s;ed to them; and they generally con&s;ented without much Difficulty, upon his &s;pecious Promi&s;es, and &s;ometimes upon the bare Propo&s;al; but if they were unwilling to engage, they were terrified by Threats of being murdered, 'til they complied<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> then all &s;uch were con&s;tantly <HI>&s;worn,</HI> invited to <HI>Hugh&s;on'</HI>s Fea&s;ts, and the&s;e commi&s;&s;ioned to &s;educe others. Many before they knew any Thing of the Secret, were invited to <HI>Hugh&s;on'</HI>s by him&s;elf or others: For, by Way of Intro|duction, as well as Confirmation. <HI>Hugh&s;on,</HI> it &s;eems, kept open Hou&s;e for the Negroes, and entertained them at all Times; tho&s;e that had no Money at free-Co&s;t; He a&s;&s;ured them, they &s;hould be always welcome to him: Tho&s;e Compliments he artfully placed at he judg'd mo&s;t proper; for us to &s;uch as were his &s;pecial Agents and dexterous Fellows, they were to pay in Money if they had it, or Money's Worth, by pilfering and &s;tealing as they could, to rai&s;e Supplies for carrying on the Common Cau&s;e; and they were to bring all to him; more e&s;pecially upon the Grand Cata&s;trophe, when the Town &s;hould be all in Flames, and the Negroes had butchered their re&s;pective Families, the mo&s;t valuable Things ea&s;ie&s;t to be removed (particularly Plate) were to be brought to <HI>Hugh&s;on'</HI>s, and it &s;eems they had already carried on &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful a Trade, and <HI>Hugh&s;on'</HI>s Hou&s;e was become a Mart of &s;o great Note among&s;t the Ne|groes, that with them it had obtained the Name of <HI>O&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o,</HI> after the Province <HI>Trading-Hou&s;e.</HI> They were likewi&s;e injoined to &s;teal their Ma&s;ters's Arms, Powder, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and lodge all in <HI>Hugh&s;on'</HI>s Cu&s;tody: He had many Barrels of Gunpowder at a Time. It appears, that this helli&s;h Project was &s;et on foot here, by Agent <HI>Hugh&s;on,</HI> four or five Years before it was ripened for Execution; and it mu&s;t needs have been a Work of Time to &s;educe &s;o many Slaves as have been detected.</P>
<P>The White Con&s;pirators were &s;worn by <HI>Ury</HI> the <HI>Prie&s;t,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> chief, and the Negroes &s;ometimes by <HI>Hugh&s;on,</HI> and &s;ometimes by <HI>Ury</HI> in a Ring &s;urrounded by them, and <HI>he,</HI> whi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e the Oath admini&s;tring, holding a <HI>Crucifix</HI> over their Heads. They were per&s;uaded that <HI>the French and Spaniards</HI> were &s;oon to come and join them, and if they did not come in a &s;et Time, they were to begin and do all them&s;elves.&mdash;Further to encourage the Town Negroes, they were told the Con|federates had many Whites and Blacks to come out of the Country to their A&s;&s;i&s;tance, particularly from <HI>Long-I&s;land,</HI> and <HI>Hugh&s;on</HI> w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> to give the Word when they were to begin. The Negroes were flattered they were to be formed into Companies, &s;everal Officers of them were named for the Purpo&s;e, Captains, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and the Town was divided into Di&s;tricts. Thus all was to be their own, and if any of them were &s;queami&s;h, <HI>Ury</HI> the <HI>Prie&s;t</HI> could forgive Sins, and did forgive them all they had committed, or &s;hould commit, <HI>provided they performed</HI> what they had engaged in, and kept all &s;ecret to their la&s;t Breath.</P>

But then his Religion! Why truly, from what has already been ob&s;erved, it might be thought to little Purpo&s;e to talk about that: But his Wife (good Woman!) was already a profe&s;s'd <HI>Papi&s;t,</HI> as common Fame has it; &s;o the Bu&s;ine&s;s might be near half done; for her Per&s;ua&s;ion join'd to a <HI>Roman Prie&s;t'</HI>s A&s;&s;i&s;tance, Artifice and dairty fine Promi&s;es, free and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ull Remi&s;&s;ion, Pardons, Indulgencies, and Ab&s;olution for Sins pa&s;t, pre&s;ent, and to come, and a Pa&s;&s;port for Heaven on Condition of per|forming Engagements [to do the Devil's Bu&s;ine&s;s] bound <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the Sanction of reiterated Oaths, to keep all &s;ecret to the la&s;t Breath; he might perhaps (as others before him have been) be buoy'd up in full Expectation of becoming rich and great here, and of a Fool's Paradi&s;e hereafter, and thus be &s;educed to enter into their abominable Mea&s;ures.</P>

<P>But it &s;o happened, That for &s;ome Time before this Grand Jury was di&s;charged, there aro&s;e great Clamour again&s;t <HI>Mary Burton;</HI> for &s;o many Negroes being daily taken into Cu&s;tody (though not &s;olely through her Evidence, but rather principally upon Di&s;covery made by the Con|fe&s;&s;ions of their <HI>black</HI> A&s;&s;ociates already in Cu&s;tody, and their Te&s;timony corroborated with hers) &s;ome People began to be afraid of lo&s;ing their Slaves; for, as Matters were then like to turn out, there was no gue&s;&s;ing where or when there would be an End of Impeachments; every one had Rea&s;on to fear their own Negro would be &s;ent for next; and indeed, all Things duly con&s;idered, it was mo&s;t pro|bable, there were but few of them that were not in the Secret; and the Girl had declared, that there were many Negroes concerned, who&s;e Per&s;ons &s;he could or might probably remember, but many who&s;e Names &s;he knew not; &s;o that it &s;hould &s;eem, at length &s;ome Ma&s;ters of the&s;e Slaves, as well as the Con&s;pirators, endeavoured to bring the Witne&s;&s;es, and the Notion of a Plot, into Di&s;credit, if perchance it might put a Stop, not only to further Pro&s;ecution, but further Enquiry and Di&s;covery al&s;o: And the&s;e Attempts, luckily for &s;ome, had &s;uch an Effect, that &s;everal Whites, as well as Negroes, e&s;caped Ju&s;tice, who, had the &s;ame Evidence appeared again&s;t them a few Weeks before, would &s;carce have been thought Objects of Mercy; nor, from what we may have ob&s;erved, would <HI>Mary Burton'</HI>s Evidence have &s;tood &s;ingle again&s;t them.</P>
<P>However, when the fir&s;t Grand Jury drew near their Di&s;charge, they were importunate with <HI>Burton,</HI> to di&s;cover all the Per&s;ons &s;he knew to be engaged in this villainous De&s;ign; for about this Time &s;he had &s;ugge&s;ted to &s;ome, that there were White People of more than ordinary Rank above the Vulgar, that were concerned, whom if &s;he told of, they would not believe her: This having been inti|mated to the Grand Jury, they were very pre&s;&s;ing with her to di&s;cover all &s;he knew, whoever they were; but the Girl &s;tood mute; nor could the Grand Jury prevail with her to name any, not with Threatnings of Impri&s;onment; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> length, being tired with her Ob&s;tinacy, they delivered her over to two of the Judges, reque&s;ting them to endeavour to &s;ift the Matter out; but neither, upon Trial, could the Judges by any Means prevail with her to be explicit to them upon the Occa&s;ion; &s;he complained (as it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;he had before done to the Grand Jury) that &s;he had been very ill u&s;ed; that not only her Life had been threatned by Con&s;pirators of both Complexions, if &s;he made Di&s;covery, but &s;he had al&s;o been frequently in&s;ulted, and abu&s;ed by People of the Town, for bringing their Negroes in que&s;tion, and that People did not believe what &s;he &s;aid, and what &s;ignified &s;peaking? or to this Purpo&s;e &s;he expre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf; &s;he intimated withal, that there were &s;ome People <HI>in Ruffles</HI> (a Phra&s;e as was under&s;tood to mean Per&s;ons of better Fa&s;hion than ordinary) that were concerned, but &s;eemed very unwilling to name any Names; 'til for the la&s;t Experiment, &s;he was told, &s;he mu&s;t expect to be impri&s;oned in the Dungeon, if &s;he continued ob&s;tinate; &s;he then began to open, and named &s;everal Per&s;ons which &s;he &s;aid &s;he had &s;een at <HI>Hugh&s;on'</HI>s among&s;t the Con&s;pirators, talking of the Con&s;piracy, who were engaged in it; among&s;t whom &s;he mentioned &s;everal of known Credit, Fortunes, and Repu|tations, and of Religious Principles &s;uperior to a Su&s;picion of being concerned in &s;uch dete&s;table Practices; at which the Judges were very much a&s;toni&s;hed; others again were imperfectly de&s;cribed by her, who&s;e reputed Religious Profe&s;&s;ion might &s;quare with &s;uch wicked De&s;igns, con|cerning whom the Girl had long before given broad Hints, but &s;aid &s;he did not know their Names, or what Part of the City they lived in; but it came out at la&s;t, that one of them was a Doctor (a profe&s;s'd <HI>Papi&s;t,</HI> as common Fame had it) whom &s;he had &s;een &s;everal Times afterwards in the Streets, and who upon Sight of her, always turned another Way, to avoid meeting her: However it was, this Per&s;on had the Di&s;cretion to remove him&s;elf out of this Province &s;oon after; and 'tis &s;aid, into foreign Dominions; and it were much to be wi&s;hed, that &s;uch others, as were ju&s;tly liable to Impeachment, would act with the &s;ame Prudence, and follow his Example, for the Sake of their own Safety, as well as the Peace and Security of our &s;elves.

<P>'Twas fit this Matter &s;hould be &s;tated in its proper Light; that on the one Hand the Evidence of this Witne&s;s (but for whom next under the Interpo&s;ition of Divine Providence, this City would in all Probability have been laid wa&s;te in A&s;hes, and many Families ma&s;&s;acred) might have its due Weight, &s;o far as de&s;erving of Credit; and on the other Hand, that where &s;he may be ju&s;tly &s;u&s;pected to have exceeded the Bounds of Truth, there a Stop may be made, to con&s;ider, and conjecture, how it might have come to pa&s;s, that &s;he told &s;ome Things incredible at the Winding up of this Affair; and weigh impartially al&s;o, the whole Current of the other Evidence, remarking how it appears to confirm and e&s;tabli&s;h her Te&s;timony, &s;o far as it has been judged proper and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">ting to publi&s;h it.</P>
<P>The other White People executed, as well as <HI>Ury,</HI> like true <HI>modern Romani&s;ts,</HI> pretended to maintain (and did prote&s;t) their Innocence to their la&s;t Breath; though <HI>Hugh&s;on</HI> him&s;elf, &s;oon after his Conviction, &s;eemed to betray &s;trong Symptoms of his Inclination to confe&s;s his Guilt&punc; and make Di&s;covery; but if he was in earne&s;t to have done &s;o, in Hopes of &s;aving his own Life, his Mind was &s;oon changed (as 'twas conjectured) by the Per&s;ua&s;ion of his Wife; yet <HI>Kerry</HI> left &s;uch Proofs behind her of many of the Particulars of this Con&s;piracy, and of her own Guilt, as add great Force to the aforegoing Accounts of it; and her rec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">ing afterwards, is another irrefragable In&s;tance, how the&s;e Wretches do prevaricate, even in their la&s;t Moments!</P>
<P>That a Plot there was, and as to the Parties and bloody Purpo&s;e of it, we pre&s;ume there can &s;carce be a Doubt among&s;t us at this Time; the Ruins of his Maje&s;ty's Hou&s;e in the Fort, are the daily Evidence and Memento of it, &s;till before our Eyes: If the other Frights and Terrors this City was alarmed with, to their great Con&s;ternation, are, as to &s;ome among&s;t us, &s;o &s;oon &s;lipt into Oblivion, yet &s;urely others will think we ought once a Year at lea&s;t, to pay our Tribute of Prai&s;e and Thank&s;giving to the Divine BEING, that through his merciful Providence and infinite Goodne&s;s, cau&s;ed this inhumane horrible Enterprize to be detected, and &s;o many of the wicked In&s;truments of it to be brought to Ju&s;tice, whereby a Check has been put to the execrable Malice, and bloody Purpo&s;es of our Foreign and Dome&s;tick Enemies, though we have not been able entirely to unravel the My&s;tery of this Iniquity; for 'twas a dark De&s;ign, and the Veil is in &s;ome Mea&s;ure &s;till upon it!</P>

<P>ANNE KANNADY, <HI>Wife of</HI> James Kannady <HI>of the City of</HI> New-York, <HI>Peruke-Maker, being duly &s;worn, depo&s;eth,</HI></P>
<Q REND="margQuotes"><P N="1">1. That on the Tue&s;day or Wedne&s;day Evening (to the be&s;t of her Remembrance) after the Deponent's Hu&s;band <HI>James Kannady,</HI> and &s;everal other City Officers had been &s;everal Times in &s;earch at <HI>John Hugh&s;on'</HI>s, after the Goods &s;tolen from Mr. <HI>Hogg'</HI>s Shop; <HI>Mary Burton,</HI> then Servant to <HI>Hugh&s;on,</HI> came to the Deponent's Hou&s;e to buy a Pound of Candles for her Ma&s;ter; and it being a very cold Eve|ning, the Deponent a&s;ked her to come in and warm her&s;elf, which &s;he did; and thereupon the Deponent took upon her to a&s;k her &s;everal Que&s;tions: Fir&s;t of all &s;he a&s;ked her her own Name, which &s;he told her as above; for the Deponent did not know it, though &s;he had been &s;everal Times at her Hou&s;e upon the like Errands, and &s;he knew that &s;he lived at <HI>Hugh&s;on'</HI>s: Then the Deponent a&s;ked her, whether that was a black Child or a white Child which that <HI>Iri&s;h Beauty</HI> had, which lodged at their Hou&s;e? and &s;he made an&s;wer, that it was as white as any of her Chil|dren, or any other Child. The Deponent then told her, that &s;he heard that there was a Negro who kept Company with her and was the Father of that Child; the &s;aid <HI>Mary</HI> an&s;wered, there was a Negro came thither to her, but he was not the Father of that Child, &s;he believed: Then the Deponent took upon her to give the &s;aid <HI>Mary</HI> good Advice; &s;he told her, &s;he would give her her Ble&s;&s;ing as a Mother would a Child, as &s;he was a Stranger in the Country; the Deponent advi&s;ed her to have no Dealings with Negroes, and to have no Hand in Thievery, for that would be a Means of bringing her to the Gallows.</P>
<P N="2">2. That the Deponent then a&s;ked her, if &s;he knew any Thing of the Thievery of <HI>Hogg'</HI>s Goods? and &s;he &s;everal Times denied that &s;he knew any Thing about the Matter. The Deponent then a&s;ked her, if &s;he had a Mind to be freed from <HI>Hugh&s;on?</HI> if &s;he had, and would di&s;cover the Goods, the Deponent would free her, and &s;he &s;hould come and live with her; then the &s;aid <HI>Mary</HI> an&s;wered, that her Hu&s;band (meaning the Deponent's, who had been at <HI>Hugh|&s;on'</HI>s upon Search, as afore&s;aid) was not <HI>cute enough:</HI> Then the Deponent &s;aid, tell me where the Goods are, and I will take you away from him to Night; &s;he an&s;wered, that &s;he would not tell her any Thing to Night, &s;he would tell her To-morrow; but that the Deponent's Hu&s;band had trod upon them. Then the Deponent let the &s;aid <HI>Mary</HI> return home.</P>
<P N="3">3. That after this Conver&s;ation was over, the Deponent the &s;ame Evening went to Mr. <HI>Mills,</HI> the Under-Sheriff, and told him what had pa&s;&s;ed as above; whereupon the &s;aid <HI>Mills, Mr. Hogg and his Wife,</HI> and &s;everal Con&s;tables, with the Deponent's Hu&s;band and her&s;elf, went down to <HI>Hugh&s;on'</HI>s Hou&s;e; and the Deponent de&s;ired <HI>Mills</HI> to go into the Hou&s;e fir&s;t, and bring <HI>Mary Burton</HI> out to her; but <HI>Mills</HI> &s;taying a long Time, the Deponent went into the Hou&s;e to him, and found him and his Wife and <HI>Mary Burton</HI> in the Parlour; and there &s;he denied all that &s;he had &s;aid to the Deponent as above: Then the Deponent charged her home with it, 'til at la&s;t the &s;aid <HI>Mary</HI> &s;aid, &s;he could not tell them any Thing there, <HI>&s;he was afraid of her Life, that they would kill her:</HI> Whereupon they took her out of the Hou&s;e; and when they had got a little Way from thence, &s;he put her Hand in her Pocket, and pulled out a Piece of Silver Money, which &s;he &s;aid was Part of <HI>Hogg'</HI>s Money which the Negro had given her; where|upon they all went with her to <HI>Alderman Banker'</HI>s; and the Deponent informing him what &s;he had promi&s;ed the &s;aid <HI>Mary, that is to &s;ay,</HI> to get her freed from her Ma&s;ter; the <HI>Alderman</HI> directed that &s;he &s;hould that Night lodge with the Under-Sheriff at the City-Hall for Safety; and the Deponent wen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> with the &s;aid <HI>Mary,</HI> and left her at Mr. <HI>Mills'</HI>s accordingly.</P>
<P N="4">4. That &s;ome time after the &s;aid <HI>Mary Burton</HI> was parted from <HI>Hugh&s;on</HI> (to the be&s;t of Deponent's Remem|brance, it was after the Hou&s;e in the Fort was burnt) &s;he came to the Deponent's Hou&s;e, and Deponent was talking about the Robbery at <HI>Hogg'</HI>s, and about Butter, Indigo, and Bees-Wax, which had been then lately &s;tolen from other

<SP>
<P><HI>A, Hugh&s;on</HI> him&s;elf filled me a Bumper of Liquor, and after having drank it, I found my &s;elf quite intoxicated; but I remember he brought me a Book, and bid me lay my Hand on it, and bid me &s;wear, and told me, if I refu&s;ed it he would kill me upon the Spot; finding my&s;elf in &s;o great a Stre&s;s, to &s;ave my Life I took the Oath.</P>

<P><HI>Q.</HI> The Night after the Fort burnt, did you return to <HI>Hugh&s;on'</HI>s?</P>
</SP>

</SP>
<SP>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Was that <HI>little</HI> Man young or old? of what make was he? and how did he employ his Time among you?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<P><HI>A.</HI> He was far from being a tall Man, but &s;hort, very lean, and a pale Vi&s;age; nor was he old; his Place was at the upper End of the Table; he often encouraged us to remain firm, like Men, in our De&s;igns: He read and wrote a great deal.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Do you know what he wrote?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<P><HI>A.</HI> I have &s;een him take the Names of the Negroes down, from time to time, by Way of Li&s;t.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> But how could <HI>Hugh&s;on,</HI> who was but a poor Man, &s;upport &s;o great an Expence at his Hou&s;e? there were Suppers every Night for you all, Candles, and many other Things, the Charge of which mu&s;t have been very great: This goes beyond my Comprehen&s;ion; for you know the Per&s;on who wrote &s;o much, mu&s;t have had Lights to &s;ee; I &s;ay, I do not know how he did to &s;upport all that Charge!</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<P><HI>A.</HI> I don't know that he was a <HI>Prie&s;t;</HI> but he u&s;ed to <HI>exhort us like a Mini&s;ter,</HI> to continue <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> in our Inten|tions, and u&s;ed to throw his Hands about like a Preacher; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;aid to us at the Meeting at <HI>Hugh&s;on'</HI>s the &s;econd Night after the Fort was burnt, <HI>N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">w God has pro&s;pered us in the Beginning, in burning the Fort, and we need not fear;

we mu&s;t be re&s;olute, and proceed in the Work, and no Doubt God will pro&s;per us in all; That the Town was too much alarmed at pre&s;ent; but they mu&s;t go on when the fine Weather came; That they (the Negroes) need not fear, he would forgive them their Sins if they kept true to their Engagements, and by and by the</HI> Spaniards <HI>would come, and then they &s;hould be free.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Have you been baptized by that <HI>little</HI> Man, they called a Prie&s;t?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<P><HI>A.</HI> No; but I have been told by &s;ome Negroes of our Company, that the <HI>little</HI> Man had baptized them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Is it true, you were to burn the <HI>Engli&s;h Church?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Yes, we agreed to burn it la&s;t Winter; but the Man whom you call <HI>a Prie&s;t</HI> oppo&s;ed it, and advi&s;ed us to &s;tay till Spring, when there would be a larger Congregation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Your Intentions then were to de&s;troy all the Whites while they were in the Church; how were you to go about it? had you Arms? and could you think otherwi&s;e but that many would have made their E&s;cape thro' the Doors and Windows? Explain me the&s;e Things as well as you can.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<P><HI>A.</HI> We had Combu&s;tibles prepared by <HI>Doctor Harry,</HI> made up into Balls, which we were to &s;et fire to, and throw them upon the Roof of the Church, which &s;ticking fa&s;t would &s;et fire to the Shingles; after which, guarding the Doors, we were to let none pa&s;s, but de&s;troy them all in the Church with our Fire-Arms; for we had a great Number of them at <HI>Hugh&s;on'</HI>s.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<P><HI>Q.</HI> Where did you u&s;e to keep your Arms at <HI>Hugh&s;on'</HI>s? for when the Searchers were &s;ent there, they were not to be found.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<P><HI>A.</HI> I believe not; for the Plot beginning to come to Light, <HI>Hugh&s;on,</HI> to &s;ecure him&s;elf, had them all thrown into the River; before that they were hid in a Hole in the Cellar.</P>
