</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THAT Di&s;cour&s;e of our ble&s;&s;ed SAVIOUR we have an Account of in this Chapter from the 17 Ver&s;e to the End, was occa&s;ioned by the <HI>Jews</HI> murmur|ing again&s;t him, and per&s;ecuting him for his heal|ing the impotent Man at the Pool of <HI>Bethe&s;da,</HI> and bidding him take up his Bed and walk on the Sabbath Day. Chri&s;t largely vindicates him&s;elf in this Di&s;cour&s;e, by a&s;&s;erting his Fel|low&s;hip with God the Father in Nature and Operations, and thereby implicitly &s;hewing him&s;elf to be Lord of the Sabbath, and by declaring to the <HI>Jews</HI> that God the Father, and he with him, did <HI>work hitherto,</HI> or even to this Time; i. e. al|though it be &s;aid that God re&s;ted on the &s;eventh Day from all his Works, yet indeed God continues to work hitherto, even to this very Day, with Re&s;pect to his greate&s;t Work, the Work of Redemption, or new Creation, which he carries on by Je&s;us Chri&s;t his Son. Pur&s;uant to the De&s;igns of which Work was his &s;hewing Mercy to fallen Men by healing their Di&s;ea&s;es, and deli|vering them from the Calamities they bro't on them&s;elves by Sin. This great Work of Redemption, God carries on from the Be|ginning of the World to this Time; and his Re&s;t from it will not come till the Re&s;urrection, which Chri&s;t &s;peaks of in the 21 and following Ver&s;es: the fini&s;hing of this Redemption as to its Pocurement, being in his own Re&s;urrection; and as to the Applica|tion, in the general Re&s;urrection and eternal Judgment, &s;poken of from V. 20. to v. 30. So that notwith&s;tanding both the Re&s;t on the &s;eventh Day, and al&s;o the Re&s;t that <HI>Jo&s;hua</HI> gave the Children of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> in <HI>Canaan</HI>; yet the great Re&s;t of the Redeemer from his Works, and &s;o of his People with him and in him, yet remains, as
<PB N="4" REF="005385_0003_1017B4F5D9CA8618">
the Apo&s;tle ob&s;erves, Heb. Chap. 4. This will be at the Re&s;ur|rection and general Judgment; which Chri&s;t here teaches the <HI>Jews,</HI> was to be brought to pa&s;s by the Son of God, by the Father's Ap|pointment, and &s;o the Works of God to be fini&s;hed by him.</P>
<P>And ina&s;much as this Vindication was &s;o far from &s;atisfying the <HI>Jews,</HI> that it did but further enrage them, becau&s;e hereby he made him&s;elf equal with God, Chri&s;t therefore refers them to the Witne&s;s of <HI>John</HI> the <HI>Bapti&s;t</HI>; who&s;e Te&s;timony they mu&s;t acquie&s;ce in, or el&s;e be incon&s;i&s;tent with them&s;elves; becau&s;e they had generally ac|knowledged <HI>John</HI> to be a great Prophet, and &s;eem'd for a while mightily affected and taken with it, that God, after &s;o long a with|holding the Spirit of Prophecy, had rai&s;ed up &s;o great a Prophet among them&mdash;and it is concerning him that Chri&s;t &s;peaks in this Ver&s;e wherein is the Text; <HI>He was a burning and a &s;hining Light; and ye were willing for a Sea&s;on to rejoice in his Light.</HI></P>
<P>In Order to a right under&s;tanding and Improvement of the Words of the Text, we may ob&s;erve</P>
<P N="1">1. What Chri&s;t here takes Notice of in <HI>John,</HI> and declares con|cerning him, viz. That <HI>he was a burning and a &s;hining Light.</HI> He was a Light to the Church of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> to reveal the Mind and Will of God to them, after a long continued dark Sea&s;on, and after they had been de&s;titute of any Prophet to in&s;truct 'em, for &s;ome Ages: He aro&s;e on <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> as the Morning Star, the Forerunner of the Sun of Righteou&s;ne&s;s, to introduce the <HI>Day-&s;pring,</HI> or Dawning of the Go&s;pel-Day, <HI>to give Light to them that</HI> 'till then had <HI>&s;at in the Darkne&s;s</HI> of perfect Night, which was <HI>the Shadow of Death; to give</HI> them <HI>the Knowledge of Salvation</HI>; as <HI>Zecharias</HI> his Father de|clares at his Circumci&s;ion, Luke 1.76, 77, 78, 79. <HI>And thou Child &s;hall be called the Prophet of the Highe&s;t; for thou &s;halt go before the Face of the Lord, to prepare his Ways; to give Knowledge of Sal|vation unto his People, by the Remi&s;&s;ion of their Sins, through the ten|der Mercy of our God; whereby the Day &s;pring from on high hath vi&s;ited us, to give Light to them that &s;it in Darkne&s;s, and in the Sha|dow of Death, to guide our Feet into the Way of Peace.</HI></P>
<P>And he was a <HI>burning Light,</HI> as he was full of a Spirit of fer|vent Piety and Holine&s;s, <HI>being filled with the Holy Gho&s;t from his Mo|ther's Womb,</HI> having his Heart warm'd and enflamed with a great Love to Chri&s;t, being that <HI>Friend of the Bridegroom, that &s;tood and heard him, and rejoiced greatly becau&s;e of the Bridegroom's Voice</HI>; and was glad that Chri&s;t <HI>increa&s;ed,</HI> though he <HI>decrea&s;ed,</HI> John 3.29, 30.
<PB N="5" REF="005385_0004_1017B511B0E5DA50">
And was animated with a Holy Zeal in the Work of the Mini&s;try: He came in this Re&s;pect <HI>in the Spirit and Power of Elias</HI>; as <HI>Eli|as</HI> was zealous in bearing Te&s;timony again&s;t the Corruption, Apo|&s;tacies, and Idolatries of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> in his Day, &s;o was <HI>John</HI> the <HI>Bapti&s;t</HI> in te&s;tifying again&s;t the Wickedne&s;s of the <HI>Jews</HI> in his Day: As <HI>Elias</HI> zealou&s;ly reproved the Sins of all Sorts of Per&s;ons in <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> not on|ly the Sins of the common People, but of their great ones, <HI>Ahab, Ahaziah</HI> and <HI>Jezabel,</HI> and their fal&s;e Prophets; with what Zeal did <HI>John the Bapti&s;t</HI> reprove all Sorts of Per&s;ons, not only the Publi|cans and Soldiers, but the Phari&s;ees and Sadducees, telling them plainly that they were a Generation of Vipers, and rebuked the Wickedne&s;s of <HI>Herod</HI> in his mo&s;t beloved Lu&s;t, tho' <HI>Herod</HI> &s;ought his Life for it, as <HI>Ahab</HI> and <HI>Ahaziah</HI> did <HI>Elijah</HI>'s. As <HI>Elias</HI> was much in warning the People of God's approaching Judgments, de|nouncing God's awful Wrath again&s;t <HI>Ahab, Jezebel</HI> and <HI>Ahaziah,</HI> and the Prophets of <HI>Baal,</HI> and the People in general: So was <HI>John the Bapti&s;t,</HI> much in warning the People to <HI>fly from the Wrath to come,</HI> telling them in the mo&s;t awakening Manner, that the <HI>Ax was laid at the Root of the Tree, and that every Tree that brought not forth good Fruit &s;hould be hewn down and ca&s;t into the Fire, and that he that came after him had his Fan in his Hand, and that he would throughly purge his Floor, and gather his Wheat into the Garner, and burn up the Chaff with unquenchable Fire.</HI></P>
<P><HI>John the Bapti&s;t</HI> was not only a <HI>burning,</HI> but <HI>a &s;hining Light</HI>: He was &s;o in his Doctrine, having more of the Go&s;pel in his Preach|ing than the former Prophets, or at lea&s;t the Go&s;pel exhibited with greater Light and Clearne&s;s, more plainly pointing forth the Per&s;on that was to be the great Redeemer, and declaring his Errand into the World, to take away the Sin of the World, as a Lamb offered in Sacrifice to God, and the Nece&s;&s;ity that all, even the mo&s;t &s;trict|ly moral and religious &s;tood in of him, being by Nature a Gene|ration of Vipers; and the &s;piritual Nature of his Kingdom, con&s;i&s;t|ing not in Circumci&s;ion, or outward Bapti&s;m, or any other external Performance or Privileges, but in the powerful Influences of the Holy Gho&s;t in their Hearts, a being <HI>baptized with the Holy Gho&s;t, and with Fire.</HI></P>
<P>In this Clearne&s;s with which he gave Knowledge of Salvation to God's People, <HI>John</HI> was a bright Light, <HI>and among them that had been born of Women there had not ari&s;en a greater than he.</HI> In this Brightne&s;s this Harbinger of the Go&s;pel Day excelled all the other
<PB N="6" REF="005385_0005_1017B4F9CA93F648">
Prophets, as the Morning Star reflects more of the Light of the Sun than any other Star, and is the brighte&s;t of all the Stars.</P>
<P>He al&s;o &s;hone bright in his Conver&s;ation, and his eminent Mor|tification and Renunciation of the Enjoyments of the World; his great Diligence and Laboriou&s;ne&s;s in his Work, his Impartiality in it, declaring the Mind and Will of God to all Sorts without Di&s;|tinction; his great Humility, rejoicing in the Increa&s;e of the Hon|our of Chri&s;t, tho' his Honour was dimini&s;hed, as the Brightne&s;s of the Morning Star dimini&s;hes, as the Light of the Sun increa&s;es; and in his Faithfulne&s;s and Courage, &s;till declaring the Mind and Will of God, though it co&s;t him his own Life. Thus his Light &s;hone before Men.</P>
<P N="2">2. We may ob&s;erve to what Purpo&s;e Chri&s;t declares the&s;e Things of <HI>John</HI> in the <HI>Text, viz.</HI> to &s;hew how great and excellent a Per&s;on he was, and worthy that the <HI>Jews</HI> &s;hould regard his Te&s;timony: great are the Things which Chri&s;t el&s;ewhere &s;ays of <HI>John</HI> the <HI>Bap|ti&s;t,</HI> as in Matth. 11.7. to the 14. He &s;peaks of him as a <HI>Prophet; and more than a Prophet</HI>; and one, <HI>than whom, there had not ri&s;en a greater among them that had been born of Women.</HI> He ob&s;erves how great and excellent a Light he was in the Text, to &s;hew the <HI>Jews</HI> how inexcu&s;able they were in not receiving the Te&s;timony he had given of him; as you may &s;ee v. 31, 32, and 33.</P>
<P>Therefore that which I would ob&s;erve from the Text to be the Subject of my pre&s;ent Di&s;cour&s;e is this:</P>
<P>'Tis the Excellency of a Mini&s;ter of the Go&s;pel to be both a burning and a &s;hining Light.</P>
<P>Thus we &s;ee it is in Chri&s;t's E&s;teem, the great Prophet of God, and Light of the World, Head of the Church, and Lord of the Harve&s;t, and the great Lord and Ma&s;ter who&s;e Me&s;&s;engers all Mi|ni&s;ters of the Go&s;pel are.</P>
<P><HI>John the Bapti&s;t</HI> was a Mini&s;ter of the Go&s;pel; and he was &s;o more eminently than the antient Prophets: for though God at &s;un|dry Times, and in diver&s;e Manners, &s;pake the Go&s;pel by them; yet <HI>John</HI> the <HI>Bapti&s;t</HI> was a Mini&s;ter of the Go&s;pel in a Man|ner di&s;tingui&s;hed from them: he is reckon'd in Scripture the fir&s;t that introduced the Go&s;pel Day, after the Law and the Prophets, Luke 6.16. <HI>The Law and the Prophets were until</HI> John; <HI>&s;ince that Time the Kingdom of God is preached.</HI> And his Preaching is called
<PB N="7" REF="005385_0006_1017B5139F1A5F30">
the <HI>Beginning of the Go&s;pel of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the Son of God,</HI> Mark 1.1. He came on that Errand, <HI>to give Knowledge of Salvation to God's People, through the Remi&s;&s;ion of their Sins</HI>; (as his Father <HI>Ze|charias</HI> ob&s;erves Luke 1.77.) and to preach the&s;e glad Tydings that the <HI>Kingdom of Heaven was at Hand.</HI></P>
<P><HI>John</HI> being thus eminently a Mini&s;ter of the Go&s;pel, and a <HI>burning and &s;hining Light</HI> being taken Notice of by Chri&s;t as his great Excellency, we may ju&s;tly hence ob&s;erve, that herein con&s;i&s;ts the proper Excellency of Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel.</P>
<P>I would, by divine A&s;&s;i&s;tance, handle the Subject in the following Method.</P>
<P N="1">1. I would &s;hew that Chri&s;t's De&s;ign, in the Appointment of the Order and Office of Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel is, that they may be <HI>Lights</HI> to the Souls of Men.</P>
<P N="2">2. I would &s;hew what is implied in their being <HI>burning Lights.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. I would &s;hew what is implied in their being <HI>&s;hining Lights.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. I would &s;hew that it is the proper Excellency of Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel to have the&s;e Things united in them, to be both burn|ing and &s;hining Lights.</P>
<P N="5">5. I would apply the&s;e Things to all that Chri&s;t has called to the the Work of the Go&s;pel Mini&s;try, &s;hewing how much it concerns them earne&s;tly to endeavour that they may be <HI>burning and &s;hining Lights.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. Shew what Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel ought to do that they may be &s;o.</P>
<P N="7">7. Say &s;omething briefly concerning the Duty of a People that are under the Care of a Go&s;pel Mini&s;ter, corre&s;pondent to tho&s;e Things that Chri&s;t has taught us concerning the End and Excellency of a Go&s;pel Mini&s;ter.</P>
<P N="1">I. I would ob&s;erve that Chri&s;t's De&s;ign in the Appointment of the Order and Office of Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel was that they might be <HI>Lights</HI> to the Souls of Men.</P>
<P><HI>Satan</HI>'s Kingdom is a Kingdom of Darkne&s;s; the Devils are the Rulers of the Darkne&s;s of this World. But Chri&s;t's Kingdom is a Kingdom of Light; the De&s;igns of his Kingdom are carried on by Light; his People <HI>are not of the Night, nor of Darkne&s;s,</HI> but are <HI>the Children of the Light,</HI> as they are the Children of God, who is <HI>the Father of Lights,</HI> and as it were a boundle&s;s Fountain of infi|nitely pure and bright Light, 1 Joh. 1.5. Jam. 1.17.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="005385_0007_1017B4FD00CB2FA0">Man by the Fall extingui&s;hed that divine Light that &s;hone in this World in its fir&s;t E&s;tate. The Scripture repre&s;ents the Wickedne&s;s of Man as reducing the World to that State wherein it was when it was yet <HI>without Form and void, and Darkne&s;s filled it.</HI> Jer. 4.22, 23. <HI>For my People is fooli&s;h, they have not known me: they are &s;ot|ti&s;h Children; and they have none Under&s;tanding: they are wi&s;e to do Evil; but to do Good they have no Knowledge. I beheld the Earth, and lo it was without Form and void; and the Heavens, and they had no Light.</HI> But God in infinite Mercy has made glorious Provi&s;ion for the Re&s;toration of Light to this fallen dark World; he has &s;ent him, who is the Brightne&s;s of his own Glory, into the World, to be the Light of the World. <HI>He is the true Light, that lighteth e|very Man that cometh into the World,</HI> i. e. Every Man in the World that ever has any true Light. But in his Wi&s;dom and Mercy, he is plea&s;ed to convey his Light to Men by Means and In&s;truments; and has &s;ent forth his Me&s;&s;engers, and appointed Mini&s;ters in his Church to be &s;ubordinate Lights, and to &s;hine with the Communi|cations of his Light, and to reflect the Beams of his Glory on the Souls of Men.</P>
<P>There is an Analogy between the divine Con&s;titution and Di&s;|po&s;ition of Things in the natural and in the &s;piritual World. The wi&s;e Creator han't left the natural World without Light; But in this our &s;olar Sy&s;tem has &s;et one great Light, immen&s;ly exceeding all the Re&s;t, &s;hining perpetually with a tran&s;cendant Fulne&s;s and Strength, to enlighten the whole; and he hath appointed other le&s;&s;er, &s;ubordinate or dependant Lights, that &s;hine with the Communica|tions and Reflections of &s;omething of his Brightne&s;s. So it is in the &s;piritual World; there God hath appointed Je&s;us Chri&s;t as a Sun of Righteou&s;ne&s;s: The Church of God <HI>has not the Sun to be her Light by Day; nor for Brightne&s;s, does the Moon give Light to her; but the Lord is her everla&s;ting Light, and her God her Glory. The new</HI> Jeru&s;alem <HI>has no Need of the Sun, nor the Moon; for the Lamb is the Light thereof.</HI> And the Mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t are as it were the Stars that encompa&s;s this glorious Fountain of Light, to receive and reflect his Beams, and give Light to the Souls of Men. As Chri&s;t therefore is in Scripture called the Sun, &s;o are his Mini&s;ters called Stars. So are the twelve Apo&s;tles, the chief Mini&s;ters of the Chri|&s;tian Church, called Rev. 12.1. <HI>And there appeared a great Wonder in Heaven, a Woman cloathed with the Sun, and the Moon under her Feet, and upon her Head a Crown of twelve Stars.</HI> And &s;o are the
<PB N="9" REF="005385_0008_1017B51566F8BAF8">
ordinary Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel called Rev. 1.16. <HI>And he had in his Right Hand &s;even Stars.</HI> And v. 20. <HI>The My&s;tery of the &s;even Stars, which thou &s;awe&s;t in my Right Hand, and the &s;even golden Can|dle&s;ticks; the &s;even Stars are the Angels of the &s;even Churches.</HI> Here al&s;o Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel are implicitly compared to tho&s;e Lamps that enlightned the Temple at <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> upon the Tops of the golden Candle&s;ticks: and more expre&s;ly in Zech. 4.2. <HI>I have look|ed, and behold a Candle&s;tick, all of Gold, with a Bowl upon the Top of it, and his &s;even Lamps thereon.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e Lamps have all their Oil from Chri&s;t, and are in kindled by his Flame, and &s;hine by his Beams; and being thus dependant on him, they are near to him, and held in his Right Hand, that they may receive Light from him, to communicate to others.</P>
<P>The U&s;e of a Light is threefold; to <HI>di&s;cover,</HI> to <HI>refre&s;h,</HI> and to <HI>direct.</HI></P>
<P>The fir&s;t U&s;e of a Light is to <HI>di&s;cover</HI> Things, or make them manife&s;t. Without Light nothing is to be &s;een. Eph. 5.13. <HI>What&s;oever doth make manife&s;t is Light.</HI> Mini&s;ters are &s;et to be Lights to the Souls of Men in this Re&s;pect, as they are to be the Means of imparting divine Truth to them, and bringing into their View the mo&s;t glorious and excellent Objects, and of leading them to, and a&s;&s;i&s;ting them in the Contemplation of tho&s;e Things that Angels de&s;ire to look into; the Means of their obtaining that Knowledge is infinitely more important and more excellent and u&s;eful, than that of the greate&s;t State&s;men or Philo&s;ophers, even that which is &s;piritual and divine: They are &s;et to be the Means of bringing Men out of Darkne&s;s into God's marvellous Light, and of bringing them to the infinite Fountain of Light, that in his Light they may &s;ee Light: They are &s;et to in&s;truct Men, and impart to them that Knowledge by which they may know God and Je&s;us Chri&s;t, whom to know is Life eternal.</P>
<P>Another U&s;e of Light is to <HI>refre&s;h</HI> and delight the Beholders. Darkne&s;s is di&s;mal: the Light is &s;weet, and a plea&s;ant Thing it is to behold the Sun. Light is refre&s;hing to tho&s;e who have long &s;at in Darkne&s;s: They therefore that watch and keep awake through a dark Night, long and wait for the Light of the Morning; and the wi&s;e Man ob&s;erves, Prov. 15.30. <HI>That the Light of the Eyes re|joiceth the Heart.</HI> Spiritual Light is e&s;pecially refre&s;hing and joy|ful. P&s;. 97.11. <HI>Light is &s;own for the Righteous, and Gladne&s;s for the Upright in Heart.</HI> They that &s;ee the Light of Chri&s;t, <HI>the Star that
<PB N="10" REF="005385_0009_1017B4FE8726A0A0">
hath ari&s;en out of Jacob,</HI> are refre&s;hed, and do rejoice, as the wi&s;e Men that &s;aw the Star that &s;hewed them where Chri&s;t was, Matth. 2.10. <HI>And when they &s;aw the Star, they rejoiced with exceeding great Joy.</HI></P>
<P>Mini&s;ters are &s;et in the Church of God to be the In&s;truments of this Comfort and Refre&s;hment to the Souls of Men, to be the In|&s;truments of leading Souls to the God of all Con&s;olation, and Foun|tain of their Happine&s;s: they are &s;ent as Chri&s;t was, and as Co|workers with him, to <HI>preach good Tidings to the Meek, to bind up the broken hearted, to proclaim Liberty to the Captives, and the opening of the Pri&s;on to them that are bound,</HI> and to comfort <HI>all that mourn</HI>: They are to lead tho&s;e that <HI>labour, and are heavy laden</HI> to their true <HI>Re&s;t,</HI> and <HI>to &s;peak a Word in Sea&s;on to him that is weary</HI>: They are &s;et to be Mini&s;ters of the Con&s;olation and Joy of the Saints. 2 Cor. 1.24. <HI>We have not Dominion over your Faith; but are Helpers of your Joy.</HI></P>
<P>The third U&s;e of Light is <HI>to direct.</HI> 'Tis by Light that we &s;ee where to go: <HI>he that walks in Darkne&s;s knows not whither he goes,</HI> and is in Danger of Stumbling and Falling into Mi&s;chief. 'Tis by Light that Men &s;ee what to do, and are enabled to work; in <HI>the Night,</HI> Chri&s;t tells us <HI>no Man can work.</HI> Mini&s;ters are &s;et to be Lights to Men's Souls in this Re&s;pect al&s;o; as <HI>Zecharias</HI> ob&s;erves of <HI>John the Bapti&s;t,</HI> Luke 1.79. <HI>To guide our Feet in the Way of Peace.</HI> Mini&s;ters have the Record of God committed to them that they may hold that forth, which God has given to be to Man as a <HI>Light &s;hining in a dark Place,</HI> to guide them in the Way thro' this dark World to Regions of eternal Light. Mini&s;ters are &s;et to be the In&s;truments of conveying to Men that true Wi&s;dom &s;poken of Job 28. <HI>Which cannot be gotten for Gold, nor &s;hall Silver be weighed for the Price thereof; which cannot be valued with the Gold of</HI> Ophir, <HI>with the precious Onyx, or the Sapphire.</HI></P>

<P N="2">II. Thing propo&s;ed, viz. to &s;hew what is implied in a Mini&s;ter of the Go&s;pel's being a <HI>burning Light.</HI></P>
<P>There are the&s;e two Things that &s;eem naturally to be under&s;tood by this Expre&s;&s;ion, <HI>viz.</HI> That his Heart be fill'd with much of the holy Ardour of a Spirit of true Piety; and that he be fervent and zealous in his Admini&s;trations.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="11" REF="005385_0010_1017B51B827E2730">1. That his Heart be full of much of the holy Ardour of a Spi|rit of true Piety. We read of <HI>the Power of Godline&s;s.</HI> True Grace is no dull, inactive, ineffectual Principle; it is a powerful Thing; there is an exceeding Energy in it: And the Rea&s;on is, that God is in it; it is a divine Principle, a <HI>Participation of the divine Na|ture,</HI> and a Communication of divine Life, of the Life of a ri&s;en Saviour, who exerts him&s;elf in the Hearts of the Saints, <HI>after the Power of an endle&s;s Life.</HI> They that have true Grace in them <HI>they live</HI>; but not by their own Life; <HI>but Chri&s;t lives in them</HI>: His Holy Spirit becomes in them a living Principle and Spring of divine Life: The Energy and Power of which is in Scripture compared to Fire Matth. 3.11. <HI>I indeed baptize you with Water; but he that cometh after me is mightier than I, who&s;e Shoes I am not worthy to bear: he &s;hall baptize you with the Holy Gho&s;t, and with Fire.</HI> True Piety is nothing remaining only in the Head, or con&s;i&s;ting in any &s;pecula|tive Knowledge or Opinions, or outward Morality or Forms of Religion; it reaches the Heart, is chiefly &s;eated there, and burns there. There is a holy Ardour in every Thing that belongs to true Grace: True Faith is an ardent Thing, and &s;o is true Re|pentance; there is a holy Power and Ardour in true &s;piritual Com|fort and Joy; yea even in true Chri&s;tian Humility, Submi&s;&s;ion and Meekne&s;s. The Rea&s;on is that divine Love or Charity is the Sum of all true Grace, which is a holy Flame inkindled in the Soul: 'Tis by this therefore e&s;pecially, that a Mini&s;ter of the Go&s;pel is a <HI>burning Light</HI>: A Mini&s;ter that is &s;o, has his Soul enkindled with the heavenly Flame; his Heart burns with Love to Chri&s;t, and fervent De&s;ires of the Advancement of his Kingdom and Glory; and al&s;o with ardent Love to the Souls of Men, and De&s;ires for their Sal|vation.</P>
<P N="2">2. The inward holy Ardour of his Soul is exerci&s;ed and manife&s;|ted in his being <HI>zealous, and fervent in his Admini&s;trations</HI>: For, he is a <HI>burning Light</HI>; which implies that his &s;piritual Heat and holy Ardour is not for him&s;eif only, but is communicative, and for the Benefit of others: He is ardent, as he is <HI>a Light,</HI> or in the Perfor|mance of the Duties of that Office wherein he is &s;et to be a Light in the Church of Chri&s;t. His fervent Zeal, which has its Foun|dation and Spring in that holy and powerful Flame of Love to God and Man, that is in his Heart, appears in the Fervency of his Prayers to God, for and with his People; and in the Earne&s;tne&s;s, and Power with which he preaches the Word of God, declares to

Sinners their Mi&s;ery, and warns them to fly from the Wrath to come, and reproves, and te&s;tifies again&s;t all Ungodline&s;s; and the unfeigned Earne&s;tne&s;s and Compa&s;&s;ion with which he invites the weary and heavy laden to their Saviour; and the fervent Love with which he coun&s;els and comforts the Saints: and the holy Zeal, Cou|rage and Steadfa&s;tne&s;s, with which he maintains the Exerci&s;e of Di&s;|cipline in the Hou&s;e of God, notwith&s;tanding all the Oppo&s;ition he meets with in that difficult Part of the mini&s;terial Work; and in the Diligence and Earne&s;tne&s;s with which he attends every Duty of his mini&s;terial Function, whether publick or private.</P>
<P>But I ha&s;ten to the</P>
<P N="3">III. Thing propo&s;ed in the Handling of this Subject, <HI>viz.</HI> To &s;hew what is implied in a Mini&s;ter's being <HI>a &s;hining Light.</HI></P>
<P>There are three Things that &s;eem to be naturally &s;ignified by it.</P>
<P N="1">1. That he be <HI>pure, clear and full in his Doctrine.</HI> A Mini&s;ter is &s;et to be a Light to Men's Souls, by Teaching, or Doctrine: And if he be a &s;hining Light in this Re&s;pect, the Light of his Doctrine mu&s;t be bright and full; it mu&s;t be pure without Mixtures of Dark|ne&s;s; and therefore he mu&s;t be &s;ound in the Faith, not one that is of a reprobate Mind; in Doctrine he mu&s;t &s;how Uncorruptne&s;s; otherwi&s;e his <HI>Light</HI> will be <HI>Darkne&s;s</HI>: He mu&s;t not lead his People into Errors, but teach them the Truth only, guiding their Feet in|to the Way of Peace, and leading them in the right Ways of the Lord.</P>
<P>He mu&s;t be one that is <HI>able to teach,</HI> not one that is raw, ignorant or unlearned, and but little ver&s;ed in the Things that he is to teach others; <HI>not a Novice,</HI> or one that is <HI>un&s;kilful in the Word of Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s</HI>; he mu&s;t be one that is well &s;tudied in Divinity, well ac|quainted with the written Word of God, mighty in the Scriptures, and able to in&s;truct and convince Gain&s;ayers.</P>
<P>And in Order to be a <HI>&s;hining Light,</HI> he mu&s;t be one that really knows what Religion is, one that is truly acquainted with that Savi|our and Way of Salvation, that he is to teach to others, that he may <HI>&s;peak the Things that he knows, and te&s;tify the Things that he has &s;een,</HI> and not be a blind Leader of the Blind: He mu&s;t be one that is acquainted with experimental Religion, and not ignorant of the inward Operations of the Spirit of God, nor of Satan's Devices; able to guide Souls under their particular Difficulties. Thus he
<PB N="13" REF="005385_0012_1017B522D6A81C20">
mu&s;t be <HI>a Scribe well in&s;tructed in Things that pertain to the Kingdom of God</HI>; one <HI>that brings forth out of his Trea&s;ures, Things now and old.</HI></P>
<P>And in Order to his being a <HI>&s;hining Light,</HI> his Doctrine mu&s;t be <HI>full,</HI> he mu&s;t not only be able to teach, but apt to teach, ready to in&s;truct the Ignorant, and them that are out of the Way, and dili|gent in Teaching, in publick and private; and careful and faithful to declare the whole Coun&s;el of God, and not to keep back any Thing that may be profitable to his Hearers.</P>
<P>Al&s;o his being a <HI>&s;hining Light</HI> implies that his In&s;tructions are <HI>clear</HI> and <HI>plain,</HI> accommodated to the Capacity of his Hearers, and tending to convey Light to their Under&s;tandings.</P>
<P N="2">2. Another Thing requi&s;ite in Order to a Mini&s;ter's being a <HI>&s;hin|ing Light,</HI> is that he be <HI>di&s;creet in all his Admini&s;trations.</HI> The fervent Zeal that thus &s;hould animate and actuate him in his Admini&s;trations &s;hould be regulated by Di&s;cretion: He &s;hould not only be know|ing, and able to communicate Knowledge and formed to do it; but al&s;o wi&s;e, and know how to conduct him&s;elf in the Hou&s;e of God, as a wi&s;e Builder, and a wi&s;e Steward. And as he is one that God hath &s;ent forth to labour in his Field, and com|mitted the Care of his Vineyard to, &s;o he &s;hould conduct him&s;elf there as one <HI>whom his God doth in&s;truct to Di&s;cretion</HI>: He &s;hould not only be as <HI>harmle&s;s as a Dove,</HI> but as <HI>wi&s;e as a Serpent</HI>; &s;hewing him&s;elf a <HI>Workman that needs not to be a&s;hamed, rightly dividing the Word of Truth</HI>; and one that <HI>knows how to govern the Church of God,</HI> and to <HI>walk in Wi&s;dom towards tho&s;e that are without.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. Another Thing implied in a Mini&s;ters being a <HI>&s;hining Light,</HI> is that he <HI>&s;hines in his Conver&s;ation</HI>: If he &s;hines never &s;o much in his Doctrine and Admini&s;trations in the Hou&s;e of God, yet if there be not an an&s;werable Brightne&s;s in his Conver&s;ation, it will have a Tendency to render all ineffectual. Chri&s;t, in Mat. 5.14, 15, 16. &s;ays to his Di&s;ciples (having undoubtedly a &s;pecial Re&s;pect to tho&s;e of them that were to be &s;ent forth to preach the Go&s;pel) <HI>Ye are the Light of the World:&mdash;Men do not light a Candle, and put it under a Bu&s;hel, but on a Candle&s;tick, and it giveth Light unto all that are in the Hou&s;e.</HI> And how does Chri&s;t direct them to give Light to others? <HI>Let your Light,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>&s;o &s;hine before Men, that others &s;eeing</HI> your good Works, <HI>may glorify your Father which is in Heaven.</HI> And he tells the &s;ame Di&s;ciples again Joh. 15.8. <HI>Herein is my Father glo|rified, that ye bear much Fruit.</HI> And how &s;hould they bring forth
<PB N="14" REF="005385_0013_1017B5038DEEF0B8">
Fruit? Chri&s;t tells them, Ver. 10. <HI>If ye keep my Commandments, ye &s;hall abide in my Love,</HI> and <HI>v.</HI> 14. <HI>Ye are my Friends if ye do what&s;o|ever I command you.</HI></P>
<P>God &s;ent his Son into the World to be the Light of the World the&s;e two Ways, <HI>viz.</HI> By revealing his Mind and Will, to the World, and al&s;o by &s;etting the World a perfect Example. So Mini&s;ters are fet to be Lights, not only as Teachers, but as En&s;amples to the Flock, 1 Pet. 5.3.</P>
<P>The &s;ame Things that Mini&s;ters recommend to their Hearers in their Doctrine, they &s;hould al&s;o &s;hew them an Example of in their Practice. Thus the Apo&s;tle &s;ays to <HI>Timothy,</HI> 1 Tim. 4.11. <HI>The&s;e Things command and teach</HI>; and then adds in the next Ver&s;e, <HI>Be thou an Example of the Believers, in Word, in Conver&s;ation, in Cha|rity, in Spirit, in Faith, in Purity.</HI> So he directs <HI>Titus,</HI> in his Tea|ching, to recommend <HI>Sobriety, Gravity, Temperance, Patience</HI> and o|ther Vertues, in the Beginning of the 2d Chapter of <HI>Titus.</HI> But then adds in the 7th v. <HI>In all Things &s;hewing thy &s;elf a Pattern of good Works.</HI></P>
<P>We &s;ee in natural Bodies, that when Heat is rai&s;ed in them to a high Degree, at Length they begin to &s;hine: And, as I ob&s;erved before, a Principle of true Grace in the Soul is like an inward Heat, an holy Ardour of an heavenly Fire inkindled in the Soul: This in Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel ought to be to that Degree, as to &s;hine forth brightly in all their Conver&s;ation; and there &s;hould as it were be a Light about them wherever they go, exhibiting to all that be|hold them, the amiable, delightful Image of the Beauty and Bright|ne&s;s of their glorious Ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>I proceed to the</P>
<P N="4">IV. Thing propo&s;ed, which is to &s;hew that the Excellency of a Mini&s;ter of the Go&s;pel con&s;i&s;ts in his being thus <HI>both a burning and a &s;hining Light.</HI></P>
<P>This is manife&s;t in two Things;</P>
<P N="1">1. Herein his Mini&s;try is acceptable and amiable in the Sight of God and Men.</P>
<P>When Light and Heat are thus united in a Mini&s;ter of the Go&s;|pel, it &s;hews that each is genuine, and of a right Kind, and that both are divine. Divine Light is attended with Heat; and &s;o, on the other Hand, a truly divine and holy Heat and Ardour is ever ac|companied with Light.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="005385_0014_1017B52477D59FF8">'Tis the Glory of the Sun that &s;uch a bright and glorious Light, and &s;uch a powerful, refre&s;hing, vivifying Heat, are both together diffu&s;ed from that Luminary. When there is Light in a Mini&s;ter, con&s;i&s;ting in human Learning, great &s;peculative Knowledge and the Wi&s;dom of this World without a &s;piritual Warmth &amp; Ardour in his Heart, &amp; a holy Zeal in his Mini&s;trations, his Light is like the Light of an <HI>Ignis Fatuus,</HI> &amp; &s;ome Kinds of putrifying Carca&s;&s;es that &s;hine in the dark, tho' they are of a &s;tinking Savour. And if on the other Hand a Mini&s;ter has Warmth and Zeal, without Light, his Heat has nothing excellent in it, but is rather to be abhor'd; being like the Heat of the bottomle&s;s Pit; where, though the Fire be great, yet there is no Light. To be hot in this Manner, and not light|&s;om, is to be like an Angel of Darkne&s;s. But Mini&s;ters by having Light and Heat united in them, will be like the Angels of Light; which for their Light and Brightne&s;s are called <HI>Morning Stars,</HI> Job 38.7. <HI>When the Morning Stars &s;ang together, and all the Sons of God &s;houted for Joy.</HI> And becau&s;e of that holy Ardour of divine Love and Zeal with which they burn, they are compar'd to a flaming Fire, P&s;al. 104.4. <HI>Who maketh his Angels Spirits, and his Mini&s;ters a flaming Fire,</HI> and are therefore called <HI>Seraphims,</HI> which is a Word that is derived from a Root that &s;ignifies <HI>to burn.</HI> So that by Mi|ni&s;ters of the Go&s;pel being <HI>burning and &s;hining Lights,</HI> the <HI>Angels of the Churches</HI> will become like the <HI>Angels of Heaven,</HI> and tho&s;e Stars held in the right Hand of Chri&s;t here below, will be like tho&s;e Morning Stars above, &amp; which is much more, hereby Mini&s;ters will be like their glorious Lord &amp; Ma&s;ter; who is not only the Ma&s;ter of Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel but is the Head &amp; Lord of the glorious Angels, whom they adore, and who communicates to them the Brightne&s;s in which they &s;hine, and the Flame with which they burn, and is the glorious Luminary and Sun of the heavenly World, from whence all the Inhabitants of that World have their Light and Life, and all their Glory. In this Sun of Righteou&s;ne&s;s is that Light, who&s;e Brightne&s;s is &s;uch that the Light of the Sun in the Firmament in Compari&s;on of it is as Darkne&s;s, yea <HI>black as Sackcloth of Hair</HI>: For he is the infinite Brightne&s;s of God's Glory; and of him it is &s;aid, I&s;ai. 24.23. <HI>Then the Moon &s;hall be confounded, and the Sun a|&s;hamed, when the Lord of Ho&s;ts &s;hall reign in Mount</HI> Zion, <HI>and in</HI> Jeru&s;alem, <HI>before his Antients, gloriou&s;ly.</HI> And accompanying this bright Light in him, is the infinitely inten&s;e Flame of Love. There is no Love to be compared to his; nor ever was Love to both God
<PB N="16" REF="005385_0015_1017B50EA77E9498">
and Man &s;o manife&s;ted, as has been in what Chri&s;t has done and &s;uf|fer'd; for <HI>herein was Love!</HI> Mini&s;ters by being burning and &s;hining Lights, become the Sons of God, of whom we read that he <HI>is Light,</HI> and that he <HI>is Love</HI>; 1 Joh. 1.5. <HI>This then is the Me&s;&s;age which we have heard of him, and declare unto you, that</HI> God is Light, <HI>and in him is no Darkne&s;s at all</HI>; and Chap. 4.16. <HI>And we have known and believed the Love that God hath to us</HI>: God is Love, <HI>and he that dwelleth in Love dwelleth in God, and God in him.</HI></P>
<P>Therefore it mu&s;t needs be that Mini&s;ters, by being burning and &s;hining Lights, are <HI>acceptable and amiable in the Sight of God,</HI> as he delights in his own Image and in the Image of his Son: And here|by al&s;o they will be <HI>honourable and amiable in the Sight of Men,</HI> all &s;uch as have any Sen&s;e of that which is truly excellent and beau|tiful; and 'tis the Way to have their Mini&s;try <HI>plea&s;ant and delight|ful</HI> to tho&s;e of this Character that &s;it under it.</P>
<P N="2">2. Herein a Mini&s;ter of the Go&s;pel will be likely to an&s;wer the Ends of his Mini&s;try: By this Means his Mini|&s;try will not only be <HI>amiable,</HI> but <HI>profitable.</HI> If a Mini&s;ter has Light without Heat, and entertains his Auditory with learn|ed Di&s;cour&s;es, without a Savour of the Power of Godline&s;s, or any Appearance of Fervency of Spirit, and Zeal for God and the good of Souls, he may gratify itching Ears, and fill the Heads of his People with empty Notions; but will not be very likely to reach their Hearts, or &s;ave their Souls. And if, on the other Hand, he be driven on with a fierce and intemperate Zeal, and vehement Heat, without Light, he will be likely to kindle the like unhallow|ed Flame in his People, and to fire their corrupt Pa&s;&s;ions and Af|fections; but will make them never the better, nor lead them a Step towards Heaven, but drive them apace the other Way.</P>
<P>But if he approves him&s;elf in his Mini&s;try, as both a burning and a &s;hining Light, this will be the Way to promote true Chri&s;tianity among&s;t his People, and to make them both wi&s;e and good, and cau&s;e Religion to flouri&s;h among them in the Purity and Beauty of it.</P>
<P>When divine Light and Heat attend each other in Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel, their Light will be like the Beams of the Sun, that don't only convey Light, but give Life; and Converts will be like to &s;pring up under their Mini&s;try, as the Gra&s;s and the Plants of the Field under the Influences of the Sun; and the Souls of the Saints will be likely to grow, and appear beautiful <HI>as the Lily,</HI> and to <HI>re|vive
<PB N="17" REF="005385_0016_1017B2CCC2EFDC90">
as the Corn, and grow as the Vine, and their Scent to be as the Wine of Lebanon</HI>; and their Light will be like the Light of Chri&s;t, which is the <HI>Light of Life,</HI> John 8.12.</P>
<P>If the Sun &s;hould &s;hine upon the Earth, with the &s;ame Bright|ne&s;s that it doth now, yet if it were without any Heat, it would give Life to nothing; the World be a de&s;olate Wilderne&s;s, with no|thing growing in it; the Death of every living Thing mu&s;t be the Con&s;equence; and the Sun's Light could be of no Service to us, but to cau&s;e us to &s;ee our own and others Mi&s;ery, without being a|ble to help our &s;elves or them. On the other Hand, if the Sun diffu&s;ed the &s;ame Heat that now it does, but the World was de&s;ti|tute at the &s;ame Time of any Light, it would be equally un&s;ervice|able: Mankind having no Light to guide them in their Bu&s;ine&s;s, in tilling the Field, or gathering the Produce of the Earth, we &s;hould be like the Egyptians in their three Days Darkne&s;s, who &s;aw not one another, nor ro&s;e from their Place: And thus al&s;o Death would be the unavoidable Con&s;equence. But by Light and Heat accompanying one another, the whole Face of the Earth becomes fruitful, and is adorned, and all Things are quickened and flouri&s;h, and Mankind enjoy both Life and Comfort.</P>
<P>I proceed to the</P>
<P N="5">V. Thing propo&s;ed in handling the Doctrine, to apply the&s;e Things to all here pre&s;ent, that Chri&s;t has called to the Work of the Go&s;pel-Mini&s;try, ob&s;erving how much it concerns &s;uch to en|deavour to be burning and &s;hining Lights.</P>
<P>Our Office and Work is mo&s;t honourable, in that we are &s;et by Chri&s;t to be Lights or Luminaries in the &s;piritual World. Light is the mo&s;t glorious Thing in the material World, and there are, it may be, no Parts of the natural World that have &s;o great an Image of the Goodne&s;s of God, as the Lights or Luminaries of Heaven; and e&s;pecially the Sun, who is con&s;tantly communicating his benign Influence to enlighten, quicken and refre&s;h the World by his Beams; which is probably the Rea&s;on that the Wor&s;hip of the Sun was (as is &s;uppo&s;ed) the fir&s;t Idolatry that Mankind fell into. But &s;o are Mini&s;ters honoured by their great Lord and Ma&s;ter, that they are &s;et to be that to Men's Souls, that the Lights of Heaven are to their Bodies; and that they might be the In&s;truments and Vehicles of God's greate&s;t Goodne&s;s, and the mo&s;t precious Fruits of his e|ternal Love to them, and Means of that Life, and Refre&s;hment and
<PB N="18" REF="005385_0017_1017B5102B4F7A88">
Joy, that are &s;piritual and eternal, and infinitely more precious than any Benefit received by the benign Beams of the Sun in the Fir|mament. And we &s;hall be likely indeed to be the In&s;truments of tho&s;e un&s;peakable Benefits to the Souls of our Fellow-Creatures, if we have tho&s;e Qualifications, which have been &s;hewn to be the true and proper Excellency of Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel. Herein our Glory will an&s;wer the honourable Station Chri&s;t has &s;et us in. And hereby our Mini&s;try will be likely to be as beneficial as our Office is honourable: We &s;hall be like Chri&s;t, and &s;hall &s;hine with his Beams; Chri&s;t will live in us, and be &s;een in his Life and Beauty in our Mini&s;try, and in our Conver&s;ation, and we &s;hall be mo&s;t likely to be the Means of bringing others to him, and of their receiving of his Light, and being made Partakers of his life, and having his Joy fulfilled in them. And this will be the Way for us hereafter to be as much advanced and di&s;tingui&s;hed in our Reward, as we are honoured in the Office and Bu&s;ine&s;s we are called to here. In this Way, tho&s;e whom Chri&s;t has &s;et to be Lights in his Church, and to be Stars in the &s;piritual World here, &s;hall be Lights al&s;o in the Church triumphant, and &s;hine as Stars forever in Heaven, Dan. 12.3. <HI>And they that be wi&s;e &s;hall &s;hine as the Brightne&s;s of the Fir|mament, and they that turn many to Righteou&s;ne&s;s, as the Stars for e|ver and ever.</HI></P>
<P>But if we fail of the proper Excellency of Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;|pel, we &s;hall not be in the Sight of God the more worthy or ho|nourable for our high Office, but the more abominable and inex|cu&s;eable; our Wickedne&s;s being aggravated by God's great Good|ne&s;s and Conde&s;cention to us, and the peculiar Obligations that he laid upon us: and in&s;tead of being eminently beneficial and great Ble&s;&s;ings as Lights to reflect the Beams of Chri&s;t's Glory and Love, we &s;hall be &s;o much the more hurtful and pernicious, for our being in &s;uch a Station; and &s;o &s;hall be likely hereafter to &s;uffer a &s;o much more dreadful Puni&s;hment. The Devils in Hell are &s;o much the more odious to God, and more the Objects of his Wrath, be|cau&s;e he &s;et them in the Dignity and Glory of Angels, the Excel|lency of which State they are fallen from. And 'tis likely that tho&s;e in Hell that will be neare&s;t to the fallen Angels, in their State of Mi&s;ery, will be tho&s;e that Chri&s;t once &s;et to be Angels of the Churches, but through their Unfaithfulne&s;s, fail'd of their pro|per Excellency and End.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="005385_0018_1017B52810942BD0">Here I would apply my &s;elf in a few Words to the Per&s;on who&s;e intended Ordination, this Day, to the great Work of the Go&s;pel-Mini&s;try, is the Occa&s;ion of this Di&s;cour&s;e.</P>

<P>God in his Providence has brought you far from your native Land, and from your Friends and Acquaintance there; but you will have Rea&s;on notwith&s;tanding to acknowledge the good Hand of his Providence towards you, if he is plea&s;ed to make you a bur|ning and &s;hining Light in this Part of his Church, and by the In|fluence of your Light and Heat (or rather by his divine Influence, with your Mini&s;try) to cau&s;e this Wilderne&s;s to bud and blo&s;&s;om as the Ro&s;e, and give it the Excellency of <HI>Carmel</HI> and <HI>Sharon,</HI> and to cau&s;e you to &s;hine in the mid&s;t of this People with warm and light&s;ome, quickening and comforting Beams, cau&s;ing their Souls to flouri&s;h, rejoice and bear Fruit, like a Garden of plea&s;ant Fruits, under the Beams of the Sun.</P>
<P>By this Means you will be to their Souls the Vehicle of the In|fluences and Ble&s;&s;ings of the heavenly World which is a World of Light and Love, &s;hall be ever held in Chri&s;t's right Hand, and &s;hall be terrible to the Powers of Darkne&s;s; and &s;hall &s;ee more and more of the Light of Chri&s;t's Glory and Grace in this Place, with you and this People, and &s;hall hereafter not only &s;hine your &s;elf, as the

Brightne&s;s of the Firmament, but &s;hall meet with them in Glory al&s;o, who &s;hall &s;hine there around you, as a bright Con&s;tellation in the highe&s;t Heaven; where they &s;hall be your everla&s;ting Crown of Rejoicing.</P>
<P>But I ha&s;ten to the</P>
<P N="6">VI. Thing propo&s;ed, which was to &s;hew what Cour&s;e Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel ought to take, or what Things they &s;hould do, that they may be burning and &s;hining Lights.</P>
<P>And here I &s;hall but ju&s;t mention Things, without enlarg|ing.</P>
<P>And in Order to this, Mini&s;ters &s;hould be diligent in their Studies, and in the Work of the Mini&s;try to which they are called; giving them&s;elves wholly to it; taking Heed to them&s;elves, that their Hearts be not engaged, and their Minds &s;wallowed up, and their Time con&s;umed, in Pur&s;uits after the Profits and vain Glory of the World.</P>
<P>And particularly, Mini&s;ters &s;hould be very conver&s;ant with the Holy Scriptures; making it very much their Bu&s;ine&s;s, with the ut|mo&s;t Diligence and Strictne&s;s, to &s;earch tho&s;e Holy Writings: For they are as it were the Beams of the Light of the Sun of Righteou&s;|ne&s;s; they are the Light by which Mini&s;ters mu&s;t be enlighten'd and the Light they are to hold forth to their Hearers; and they are the Fire whence their Hearts and the Hearts of their Hearers mu&s;t be enkindl'd.</P>
<P>They &s;hould earne&s;tly &s;eek after much of the &s;piritual Know|ledge of Chri&s;t, and that they may live in the clear Views of his Glory. For by this Means they will be changed into the Image of the &s;ame Glory and Brightne&s;s, and will come to their People, as <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> came down to the Congregation of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> after he had &s;een God's Back-parts in the Mount, with his Face &s;hining. If the Light of Chri&s;t's Glory &s;hines upon them, it will be the Way for them to &s;hine with the &s;ame Kind of Light on their Hearers, and to reflect the &s;ame Beams, which have Heat, as well as Brightne&s;s. The Light of the Knowledge of the Glory of God in the Face of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, is the Trea&s;ure the Apo&s;tle &s;peaks of, that Mini&s;ters have as in Earthen Ve&s;&s;els: 2 Cor. 4.6, 7. <HI>For God who commanded the Light to &s;hine out of Darkne&s;s hath &s;hined into your Hearts, to give the Light of the Knowledge of the Glory of God, in the Face of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. But we have this Trea&s;ure in Earthen Ve&s;&s;els.</HI> This was
<PB N="21" REF="005385_0020_1017B53279563900">
probably typified of old by the burning Lights &amp; Lamps which <HI>Gi|deon</HI>'s Soldiers had in one Hand in Earthen Pitchers, while they held a Trumpet in the other, with which they &s;ounded (typifying the Preaching of the Go&s;pel) And thus with the Sound of the&s;e Trum|pets, and the&s;e burning Lights or Earthen Ve&s;&s;els, they overcame the Enemies of God and his People.</P>
<P>Mini&s;ters, in Order to their being burning and &s;hining Lights, &s;hould walk clo&s;ely with God, and keep near to Chri&s;t; that they may ever be enlighten'd and enkindled by him. And they &s;hould be much in &s;eeking God, and conver&s;ing with him by Prayer, who is the Fountain of Light and Love: And knowing their own Emp|tine&s;s and Helple&s;&s;ne&s;s &s;hould be ever dependant on Chri&s;t; being &s;en&s;ible with <HI>Jeremiah</HI> that they are Children, &s;hould &s;it as Children at Chri&s;t's Feet to hear his Word, and be in&s;tructed by him; and being &s;en&s;ible with <HI>I&s;aiah</HI> that they are Men of unclean Lips &s;hould &s;eek that their Lips may be as it were touched with a live Coal from the Altar, as it were by the bright and burning Seraphim.</P>
<P>I come now to the</P>
<P N="7">VII and la&s;t Thing propo&s;ed, to &s;ay &s;omething very briefly con|cerning the Duties of a People that are under the Care of a Mini|&s;ter, corre&s;ponding with the&s;e Things that Chri&s;t has taught us con|cerning the Nature and End of this &s;acred Office. And here I would have a &s;pecial Re&s;pect to the People of God in this Place, who are about to have the Care of their Souls committed to him, that is now &s;olemnly to be &s;et apart to the Work of the Mi|ni&s;try.</P>
<P>If it be, as you have heard, the proper Excellency of a Mini&s;ter of the Go&s;pel to be a burning and a &s;hining Light, then it is your Duty earne&s;tly to pray for your Mini&s;ter that he may be filled with Divine Light, and with the Power of the Holy Gho&s;t, to make him &s;o. For herein you will but pray for the greate&s;t Bene|fit to your &s;elves; for if your Mini&s;ter burns and &s;hines, it will be for your Light and Life. That which has been &s;poken of, as it is the chief Excellency of a Mini&s;ter, fo it renders a Mini&s;ter the greate&s;t Ble&s;&s;ing of any Thing in the World that ever God be&s;tows on a People.</P>
<P>And as it is your Duty, to pray that your Mini&s;ter may by this Means become &s;uch a Ble&s;&s;ing to you, &s;o you &s;hould do your Part to make him &s;o, by &s;upporting him, and putting him under the be&s;t
<PB N="22" REF="005385_0021_1017B535D5DBFE38">
Advantage, with a Mind free from worldly Cares, and the Pre&s;&s;ure of outward Wants and Difficulties, to give him&s;elf wholly to his Work; and by all proper Acts of Re&s;pect and Kindne&s;s and A&s;&s;i&s;|tance, to encourage his Heart, and &s;trengthen his Hands: And to take Heed that in&s;tead of this you don't take a Cour&s;e to ob&s;cure and extingui&s;h the Light that would &s;hine among you, &amp; to &s;mother and &s;uppre&s;s the Flame, by ca&s;ting Dirt upon it; by nece&s;&s;itating your Mini&s;ter by your Penuriou&s;ne&s;s towards him, to be envolved in worldly Care; and by di&s;couraging his Heart by Di&s;repect and Un|kindne&s;s. And particularly when your Mini&s;ter &s;hews him&s;elf to be a burning Light by burning with a proper Zeal again&s;t any Wickedne&s;s that may be breaking out among&s;t his People &amp; manife&s;ts it by bear|ing a proper Te&s;timony again&s;t it in the Preaching of the Word or by a faithful Exerci&s;e of the Di&s;cipline of God's Hou&s;e, in&s;tead of taking it thankfully, and yeiding to him in it, as you ought, don't rai&s;e another Fire of a contrary Nature, again&s;t it, <HI>viz.</HI> the Fire of your unhallowed Pa&s;&s;ions, reflecting upon and reproaching him for his Faithfulne&s;s. Herein you will act very unbecoming a Chri&s;tian People, and &s;hew your&s;elves very ungrateful to your Mini&s;ter, and to Chri&s;t who has be&s;towed upon you &s;o faithful a Mini&s;ter, and will al&s;o, while you fight again&s;t him, and again&s;t Chri&s;t, fight mo&s;t effectually again&s;t your own Souls. If Chri&s;t gives you a Mini&s;ter that is a burning and &s;hining Light, take Heed that you don't <HI>hate the Light, becau&s;e your Deeds are reproved</HI> by it; but <HI>love and rejoice in his Light</HI>; and that not only for a Sea&s;on, like <HI>John the Bapti&s;t's</HI> apo&s;tatizing Hearers: And <HI>come to the Light.</HI> Let your frequent Re|&s;ort be to your Mini&s;ter for In&s;truction in Soul Ca&s;es, and under all &s;piritual Difficulties; and be open to the Light and willing to re|ceive it; and be obedient to it. And thus walk as the Children of the Light, and follow your Mini&s;ter wherein he is a Follower of Chri&s;t, i. e. wherein he is as a burning and &s;hining Light. If you continue &s;o to do, your Path will be the Path of the Ju&s;t, which &s;hines more and more to the perfect Day, and the End of your Cour&s;e &s;hall be in tho&s;e bli&s;sful Regions of everla&s;ting Light above, where you &s;hall &s;hine forth with your Mini&s;ter, and both with Chri&s;t, <HI>as the Sun, in the Kingdom of the Heavenly Father.</HI></P>
