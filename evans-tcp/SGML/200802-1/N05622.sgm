<P>_ALTHOUGH I am per&s;uaded that nothing hath a greater Tendency to &s;trengthen the Hands of Infidels, than the too frequent Altercations between the Profe&s;&s;ors of Chri&s;tianity; yet there are certain Occa&s;ions wherein the nece&s;&s;ary Defence of the Principles of our holy Religion, as well as the Practice of it, renders public Remon|&s;trances of the greate&s;t U&s;e and Importance.

<P>The Di&s;tre&s;s and Angui&s;h of Mind that Hundreds have been involved in, upon this very Account, is I believe un&s;peakable <NOTE N="(e)" PLACE="foot">Since my writing this, I have been told of a very &s;in|gular Expedient made u&s;e of by Mr. <HI>Peter Bo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ler,</HI> one of the Brethren's Bi&s;hops, in order to &s;trengthen the Faith, and to rai&s;e the drooping Spirits of Mr. <HI>W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters">m Bell,</HI> who has been unhappily drawn in, with &s;everal others, to be one of their Agents. It was this,&mdash;It being Mr. <HI>Bell's</HI> Birth-day, he was &s;ent for from his Hou&s;e in <HI>Nevil's-alley Fetter-lane,</HI> but for a While, having had &s;ome Words with Mr. <HI>Bochler,</HI> he refu&s;ed to come; at length <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e complied, and was introduced into a Hall, in the &s;ame Alley, where was placed an artificial Moun|tain, which, upon &s;inging a particular Ver&s;e, was made to fall down, and then behind it was di&s;covered an Illumination, repre&s;enting JESUS CHRIST and Mr. <HI>Bell</HI> &s;itting very near or embracing each other; out of the Clouds was al&s;o repre&s;ented Plenty of Money falling round Mr. <HI>Bell</HI> and the Saviour. This Story appeared to me &s;o incredible at the fir&s;t hearing, that, though I could not doubt the Veracity of the Relator, yet, fearing he might be mi&s;informed, I &s;ent for him again, and he a&s;&s;ured me that Mr. <HI>Bell</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">old this Story him&s;elf &s;ome Time ago in Company; and a Per&s;on of good Reputa|tion of that Company related it to an Acquaintance of mine. May GOD grant him, and all others, who have been unde|&s;ignedly concerned, a more &s;ure and &s;table Prop for their Faith, even his own Word, in which he cau&s;es his People to tru&s;t. Then, and not till then, even upon the greate&s;t Emer|gency, they may, without any fanciful Repre&s;entations, boldly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ay, <HI>Who art thou, O great Mountain?

<P>Who, who but them&s;elves, <HI>my Lord,</HI> can tell the late Perplexity of their Mind<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, who have been already arre&s;ted, or obliged to break off their re&s;pective Partner&s;hips?

And how piti|able, <HI>my Lord,</HI> mu&s;t the pre&s;ent Circum&s;tances of young Mr. <HI>Rhodes</HI> <NOTE N="(g)" PLACE="foot">The Ca&s;e of Mr. <HI>Rhodes</HI> is very &s;ingular: He was of a mean Birth and Occupation, but, upon the unexpected falling of many Lives, became &s;uddenly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of an E&s;tate of above Four Hundred Pounds a Year; and, to &s;erve the Brethren, after many Importunities, he was induced to di&s;po&s;e of it. Mr. <HI>Lee,</HI> the Banker, purcha&s;ed it, and Me&s;&s;. <HI>Freeman</HI> and <HI>Grace</HI> received Six Thou&s;and Pounds of the Money towards what was due to them. Be&s;ides this, Mr. <HI>Rhodes</HI> was bound for many Thou&s;ands more. This made him very unea&s;y, and fearing the Con&s;equence, he one Afternoon, about ten Weeks ago, &s;tole an Interview with two &s;ingle Brethren, and be&s;eeched them for Chri&s;t's &s;ake to let him have Twenty-five Pounds, for the Payment of which he left them his Watch, Bureau, Hor&s;e and Saddle. He then took his Leave, &s;aying, in all Probability he &s;hould never &s;ee them any more; and having nothing to &s;p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">re to leave behind for his poor Mother, (who is &s;ince dead) was content to &s;end her a few parting Lines. Since he has been gone, the Hor&s;e, Watch, Bureau, and Saddle, were &s;old for Twenty-&s;even Pounds and Three Shillings; &s;o that the young Man has the Balance in Bank. GOD grant that this may prove the la&s;t Per&s;on that may be impo&s;ed on in this Wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">!</NOTE> be, who, to &s;top a

little of the above-mentioned Gap, was pre|vailed on, <HI>your Lord&s;hip</HI> knows by whom, about Eighteen Months ago, to &s;ell his E&s;tate of above Four Hundred Pounds a Year, and went, or was &s;ent off very lately, as I am a&s;|&s;ured, to <HI>France,</HI> (leaving a de&s;titute Mother behind him) only with Twenty-five Pounds; for the Payment of which he left his Watch, Bureau, Hor&s;e and Saddle.</P>
<P>The&s;e are but a few In&s;tances, <HI>my Lord,</HI> among&s;t many, indeed, too, too many, that might be given. The Brethren's Agents, and tho&s;e concerned with them, can be&s;t tell what horrid Equivocations, Untruths, and low Ar|tifices, have been made u&s;e of to procure Mo|ney, at high Intere&s;ts, wherever it was to be had, in order to keep up the Brethren's Cre|dit in that poor, lame Manner it has been kept up for a con&s;iderable Time. Was the whole Scene to be opened, I believe every one would be of Opinion that &s;uch an eccle|&s;ia&s;tical Project never was heard of before in any Part of his Maje&s;ty's Dominions.</P>
<P>This, <HI>my Lord,</HI> the Royal Exchange has long &s;ince rung of; and if the &s;ame Part has been acted abroad <NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">It appears too plain from Mr. <HI>Rimius,</HI> that this has been the Ca&s;e.

<P>Surely, the LORD of Lords, who&s;e Eyes are like a Flame of Fire, and who re|quires Truth in the inward Parts, will one Day or other vi&s;it for the&s;e Things, by bring|ing to Light the hidden Things of Darkne&s;s, and thereby making manife&s;t the Coun&s;els of the Hearts.</P>
<P>I need not inform <HI>your Lord&s;hip</HI> that <HI>Babels</HI> are generally &s;uffered to be built pretty high, before GOD comes down to confound the Language of the Builders. If Knaves are employed, (as commonly they are) GOD's Honour is concerned to di&s;cover them; and if any of his own Children are unde&s;ignedly drawn in, (which is frequently the Ca&s;e) He who hath promi&s;ed not to &s;uffer them to be tempted above what they are able to bear, will in Mercy, &s;ome Way or other, rebuke the Tempter, and make a Way for them to e&s;cape. It is true, this, in public Concerns, may &s;ometimes expo&s;e them to a little worldly Contempt, and, for a While, they may &s;eem|ingly be cru&s;hed under the Rubbi&s;h of the fal|len Fabric; but even this &s;hall work together for their Good; and happy will it be for them, if, after all, they at length learn this important Le&s;&s;on, viz. <HI>That it is dangerous, upon any Pretence what&s;oever, to go from the
<PB N="15" REF="007136_0015_102AFD2A8417DA00">
written Word, or give up their Con&s;ciences to the Guidance of my Man, or Body of Men under Heaven.</HI> This, <HI>your Lord&s;hip</HI> well knows, is what weak and un&s;table Souls are too apt to do, and artful and de&s;igning Men, who are fond of Power, e&s;pecially if naturally they are of an am|bitious Turn of Mind, ea&s;ily catch at the plea&s;ing Bait. But Hone&s;ty, <HI>my Lord,</HI> will be found to be the be&s;t Policy after all: And therefore God forbid that any who call them&s;elves the Followers of the Lamb &s;hould glory in any thing &s;ave the Cro&s;s of CHRIST.</P>
<P>At pre&s;ent I &s;hall add no more, but earne&s;t|ly &s;aying <HI>Amen</HI> to that Part of the Brethren's <HI>Litany,</HI> however exceptionable in other Re|&s;pects, <HI>From untimely Projects, and from un|happily becoming great, keep us our good Lord and God</HI>; and as heartily praying, that the glorious JESUS may pro&s;per all that is Right, and give Grace to correct and amend all that is Wrong among all his People of all Denominations; I &s;ub&s;cribe my&s;elf,</P>
