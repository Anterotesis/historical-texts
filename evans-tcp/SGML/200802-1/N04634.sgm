<Q>Thy Land &s;hall be married: For as a young Man mar|rieth a Virgin, &s;o &s;hall thy Sons marry thee; and as the Bridegroom rejoiceth over the Bride, &s;o &s;hall thy GOD rejoice over thee.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IN the mid&s;t of many ble&s;&s;ed Promi&s;es that God makes to his Church in this and the preceding and following Chapters, of Advancement to a State of great Peace, Comfort, Honour and Joy, after long continued Affliction, we have the Sum of all contained in the&s;e two Ver&s;es. In the 4th Ver&s;e God &s;ays to his Church, <HI>Thou &s;hall no more be termed For&s;aken, neither &s;hall thy Land any more be termed De&s;olate; but thou &s;halt be called</HI> Hephzibah, <HI>and thy Land</HI> Beulah; <HI>for the Lord delighteth in thee, and thy Land &s;hall be married.</HI> When it is &s;aid, <HI>Thy Land &s;hall be married,</HI> we are by <HI>thy Land</HI> to under&s;tand <HI>the Body of thy People, thy whole Race;</HI> the Land, by a Metonymy very u&s;ual in Scripture, being put for the People that inhabit the Land.</P>
<P>The 5th Ver&s;e explains how this that is promi&s;ed in the la&s;t Words of Ver&s;e 4th &s;hould be accompli&s;hed in two Things, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> <HI>in being married to her Sons,</HI> and <HI>married to her God.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. It is promi&s;ed that &s;he &s;hould be <HI>married to her Sons,</HI> or that her Sons &s;hould marry her; <HI>For as a young Man

marrieth a Virgin, &s;o &s;hall thy Sons marry thee.</HI> Or, as the Words might have been more literally tran&s;lated from the Original; <HI>As a young Man is married to a Virgin, &s;o &s;hall thy Sons be married to thee.</HI> Some by this under&s;tand a Promi&s;e that the Po&s;terity of the captivated <HI>Jews</HI> &s;hould return again from <HI>Babylon</HI> to the Land of <HI>Canaan,</HI> &amp; &s;hould be, as it were, married or wedded to their own Land; <HI>i.e.</HI> They &s;hould be re-united to their own Land, and &s;hould have great Comfort and Joy in it, as a young Man in a Virgin that he marries. But their thus interpreting the Words &s;eems to be through Inadvertence; not carefully ob&s;erving the Words them&s;elves, how that when it is &s;aid, <HI>So &s;hall thy Sons marry thee,</HI> God don't direct his Speech to the Land it&s;elf, but to the Church who&s;e Land it was; the Pronoun <HI>Thee</HI> being applied to the &s;ame my&s;tical Per&s;on in this former Part of the Ver&s;e, as in the Words immediately following in the latter Part of the &s;ame Sentence, <HI>And as the Bridegroom rejoiceth over the Bride, &s;o &s;hall thy God rejoice over thee.</HI> It is the Church, and not the Hills and Valleys of the Land of <HI>Canaan,</HI> that is God's Bride, or the Lamb's Wi&s;e. 'Tis al&s;o manife&s;t that when God &s;ays, <HI>So &s;hall thy Sons marry thee,</HI> he continues to &s;peak to her to whom he had &s;poken in the three pre|ceding Ver&s;es; but there it is not the Ground or Soil of the Land of <HI>Canaan,</HI> but the Church that he &s;peaks to when he &s;ays, <HI>The Gentiles &s;hall &s;ee thy Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and all Kings thy Glory; and thou &s;hall be called by a new Name, which the Mouth of the Lord &s;hall name: Thou &s;halt al&s;o be a Crown of Glory in the Hand of the Lord, and a royal Diadem in the Hand of thy God: Thou &s;halt no more be termed For&s;aken,</HI> &amp;c. And to repre&s;ent the Land it&s;elf as a Bride, and the Subject of E&s;pou&s;als and Marriage, would be a Figure of Speech very unnatural, and not known in Scripture; but for the Church of God to be thus repre&s;ented is very u&s;ual through|out the Scripture from the Beginning to the End of the Bible. And then it is manife&s;t that the Return of the <HI>Jews</HI> to the Land of <HI>Canaan</HI> from the <HI>babyloni&s;h</HI> Captivity, is not the Event mainly intended by the Prophecy of which the&s;e Words are a Part. The Time of that Return was

not the Time when that was fulfilled in the 2d Ver&s;e of this Chapter, <HI>And the Gentiles &s;hall &s;ee thy Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and all Kings thy Glory; and thou &s;hall be called by a new Name, which the Mouth of the Lord &s;hall name.</HI> That was not the Time &s;poken of in the two preceding Chapters, with which this Chapter is one continued Prophecy.

<P>So that the Children of <HI>I&s;rael's</HI> being wedded to the Land of <HI>Canaan,</HI> being manife&s;tly not the meaning of tho&s;e Words in the Text, <HI>As a young Man marrieth a Virgin, &s;o &s;hall thy Sons marry thee,</HI> as &s;ome &s;uppo&s;e; I chu&s;e rather, with others, to under&s;tand the Words of the Church's Union with her faithful Pa&s;tors, and the great Benefits &s;he &s;hould receive from them. God's Mini&s;ters, tho' they are &s;et to be the In&s;tructors, Guides and Fathers of God's Peo|ple, yet are al&s;o the Sons of the Church; Amos 2. 11. <HI>I rai&s;ed up of your Sons for Prophets, and of your young Men for Nazarites.</HI> Such as the&s;e, when faithful, are tho&s;e pre|cious Sons of <HI>Zion</HI> comparable to fine Gold &s;poken of <HI>Lam</HI> 4. 2. &s;poken of again Ver&s;e 7. <HI>Her Nazarites were purer than Snow, they were whiter than Milk.</HI> And as he that marries a young Virgin becomes the Guide of her Youth; &s;o the&s;e Sons of <HI>Zion</HI> are repre&s;ented as taking her by the Hand as her Guides, I&s;a. 51. 18. <HI>There is none to guide her among all the Sons whom &s;he hath brought forth; neither is there any that taketh her by the Hand of all the Sons that &s;he hath brought up.</HI> That by the&s;e Sons of the Church is meant Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel, is confirmed by the next Ver&s;e to the Text, <HI>I have &s;et Watchmen upon thy Walls, O Jeru&s;alem.</HI></P>
<P>That the Sons of the Church &s;hould be married to her as a young Man to a Virgin, is a My&s;tery or Paradox not unlike many others held forth in the Word of God, con|cerning the Relation between Chri&s;t and his People, and their Relation to him and to one another; &s;uch as that Chri&s;t is <HI>David'</HI>s Lord and yet his Son, and both the Root and Offspring of <HI>David;</HI> that Chri&s;t is a Son born and a Child given, and yet the everla&s;ting Father; that the Church is Chri&s;t's Mother, as &s;he is repre&s;ented <HI>Cant.</HI> 3. 11. and 8. 1, and yet that &s;he is his Spou&s;e, his Si&s;ter and his Child; that Believers are Chri&s;t's Mother, and yet his Si&s;ter and Brother; and that Mini&s;ters are the Sons of the Church, and yet that they are her Fathers, as the Apo&s;tle &s;peaks of him&s;elf, as the Father of the Members of the Church

<P N="2">2. The &s;econd and chief Fulfilment here &s;poken of, of that Promi&s;e of the Church's being married, is in her being married to Chri&s;t; <HI>And as the Bridegroom rejoiceth over the Bride, &s;o &s;hall thy God rejoice over thee.</HI> Not that we are to under&s;tand that the Church has many Hu&s;bands or that Chri&s;t is one Hu&s;band, and Mini&s;ters are other Hu&s;bands that &s;he hath: For tho' Mini&s;ters are here &s;poken of as being married to the Church, yet 'tis not as being his Fellows or Competitors, or as Hu&s;bands of the Church &s;tanding in a conjugal Relation to his Bride in any wi&s;e parallel with his: For the Church has but one Hu&s;band; &s;he is not an Adultere&s;s, but a Virgin, that is devoted wholly to the Lamb, and follows him whither&s;oever he goes&punc; But Mini&s;ters e&s;pou&s;e the Church intirely as Chri&s;t's Am|ba&s;&s;adors, as repre&s;enting him and &s;tanding in his Stead, being &s;ent forth by Him to be married to her in his Name, that by this Means &s;he may be married to him. As when a Prince marries a foreign Lady by Proxy, the Prince's Amba&s;&s;ador marries her, but not in his own Name, but in the Name of his Ma&s;ter, that he may be the In&s;trument of bringing her into a true conjugal Relation to him. This is agreable to what the Apo&s;tle &s;ays, 2 Cor. 11. 2. <HI>I am jea|lous over you with a godly Jealou&s;y; for I have e&s;pou&s;ed you to one Hu&s;band, that I may pre&s;ent you as a cha&s;te Virgin to Chri&s;t.</HI> Here the Apo&s;tle repre&s;ents him&s;elf as being, as it were, the Hu&s;band of the Church of <HI>Corinth;</HI> for 'tis the Hu&s;band that is jealous when the Wife commits Adultery; and yet he &s;peaks of him&s;elf as having e&s;pou&s;ed them, not in his own Name, but in the Name of Chri&s;t, and for him, and him only, and as his Amba&s;&s;ador, &s;ent forth to bring them Home a cha&s;te Virgin to him. Mini&s;ters are in the Text repre&s;ented as married to the Church in the &s;ame Sen&s;e that el&s;ewhere they are repre&s;ented as Fathers of the Church: The Church has but one Father even God, and Mini&s;ters are Fathers as his Amba&s;&s;adors; &s;o the Church

has but one Shepherd, Joh. 10. 16. <HI>There &s;hall be one Fold and one Shepherd;</HI> but yet Mini&s;ters, as Chri&s;t's Amba&s;&s;a|dors, are often call'd the Church's Shepherds or Pa&s;tors. The Church has but one Saviour; but yet Mini&s;ters, as his Amba&s;&s;adors and In&s;truments, are called her Saviours; 1 Tim. 4. 16. <HI>In doing this thou &s;halt b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">th &s;ave thy &s;elf and them that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ear thee.</HI> Obad. 21. <HI>And Saviours &s;hall come upon Mount Zion.</HI> The Church has but one Prie&s;t; but yet in <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 66. 21. &s;peaking of the Mini&s;ters of the <HI>Gentile</HI> Na|tions, 'tis &s;aid, <HI>I will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ake of them for Prie&s;ts and Levites.</HI> The Church has but one Judge, for the Father hath com|mitted all Judgment to the Son; yet Chri&s;t tells his Apo|&s;tles, that they &s;hall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">it on twelve Thrones judging the twelve Tribes of <HI>I&s;rael.</HI></P>
<P>When the Text &s;peaks fir&s;t of Mini&s;ters marrying the Church, and then of Chri&s;t's rejoicing over her as the Bride|groom rejoiceth over the Bride; the former is manife&s;tly &s;poken of as being in order to the latter, even in order to the Joy and Happine&s;s that the Church &s;hall have in her true Bridegroom. The preaching of the Go&s;pel is in this Con|text &s;poken of three Times going, as the great Means of bringing about the Pro&s;perity and Joy of the Church; that is foretold; once in the fir&s;t Ver&s;e, <HI>For</HI> Zion's <HI>Sake will I not hold my Peace, and for</HI> Jeru&s;alem's <HI>Sake I will not re&s;t, until the Righteou&s;ne&s;s thereof go forth as Brightne&s;s, and the Salvation thereof as a Lamp that burneth;</HI> and then again in the Text; and la&s;tly in the two following Ver&s;es, <HI>I have &s;et Watchmen upon thy Walls O</HI> Jeru&s;alem, <HI>which &s;hall never hold their Peace Day nor Night: Ye that make mention of the Lord keep not Silence, and give him no Re&s;t 'till he e&s;tabli&s;h and 'till he make</HI> Jeru&s;alem <HI>a Prai&s;e in the Earth.</HI></P>
<P>The Text thus opened affords the&s;e two Propo&s;itions proper for our Con&s;ideration on the &s;olemn Occa&s;ion of this Day.</P>
<P>I. The uniting of faithful Mini&s;ters with Chri&s;t's People in the mini&s;terial Office, when done in a due Manner, is like a young Man's marrying a Virgin.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="005766_0008_1026E032DC78C9B0">
II. This Union of Mini&s;ters with the People of Chri&s;t is in order to their being brought to the Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s of a more glorious Union, in which Chri&s;t &s;hall rejoice over them, as the Bridegroom rejoiceth over the Bride.</P>
<P>I. The uniting of a faithful Mini&s;ter with Chri&s;t's People in the mini&s;terial Office, when done in a due Manner, is like a young Man's marrying a Virgin.</P>
<P>I &s;ay, the uniting of a <HI>faithful Mini&s;ter</HI> with Chri&s;t's Peo|ple, and in a <HI>due Manner:</HI> For we mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e that the Promi&s;e God makes to the Church in the Text, relates to <HI>&s;uch Mini&s;ters,</HI> and <HI>&s;uch a Manner</HI> of Union with the Church; becau&s;e this is promi&s;ed to the Church as a Part of her latter Day Glory, and as a Benefit that &s;hould be granted her by God, as the Fruit of his great Love to her, and an In&s;tance of her great &s;piritual Pro&s;perity and Happi|ne&s;s in her pure&s;t and mo&s;t excellent State on Earth. But it would be no &s;uch In&s;tance of God's great Favour and the Church's Happine&s;s to have unfaithful Mini&s;ters entring into Office in an undue and improper Manner. They are evidently faithful Mini&s;ters that are &s;poken of in the next Ver&s;e, where the &s;ame are doubtle&s;s &s;poken of as in the Text; <HI>I have &s;et Watchmen on thy Walls, O</HI> Jeru&s;alem, <HI>which &s;hall never hold their Peace Day nor Night.</HI> And they are tho&s;e that &s;hall be introduced into the Mini&s;try at a Time of its extraordinary Purity, Order and Beauty, where|in (as is &s;aid in the fir&s;t, &s;econd and third Ver&s;es) <HI>her Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s &s;hould go forth as Brightne&s;s, and the Gentiles &s;hould &s;ee her Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and all Kings her Glory, and &s;he &s;hould be a Crown of Glory in the Hand of the Lord, and a royal Diadem in the Hand of her God.</HI></P>
<P>When I &s;peak of the uniting of a faithful Mini&s;ter with Chri&s;t's People in a <HI>due Manner,</HI> I don't mean a due Man|ner only with Regard to external Order; but its being truly done in a holy Manner, with &s;incere upright Aims and In|tentions, with a right Di&s;po&s;ition, and proper Frames of
<PB N="12" REF="005766_0009_1026E03FED389190">
Mind in tho&s;e that are concerned; and particularly in the Mini&s;ter that takes Office, and God's People to whom he is united, each exerci&s;ing in this Affair a proper Regard to God and one another.</P>
<P>Such an uniting of a faithful Mini&s;ter with the People of God in the mini&s;terial Office, is in &s;ome Re&s;pects like a young Man's marrying a Virgin.</P>
<P N="1">1. When a duly qualified Per&s;on is properly inve&s;ted with the mini&s;terial Character, and does in a due Manner take upon him the &s;acred Work and Office of a Mini&s;ter of the Go&s;pel, he does in &s;ome Sen&s;e, e&s;pou&s;e the Church of Chri&s;t in general: For tho' he don't properly &s;tand in a pa&s;toral Relation to the whole Church of Chri&s;t through the Earth, and is far from becoming an univer&s;al Pa&s;tor; yet thenceforward he has a different Concern with the Church of Chri&s;t in general, and its Intere&s;ts and Welfare, than other Per&s;ons have that are Laymen, and &s;hould be regarded otherwi&s;e by all the Members of the chri&s;tian Church: where ever he is providentially called to preach the Word of God, or mini&s;ter in holy Things, he ought to be received as a Mini&s;ter of Chri&s;t, and the Me&s;&s;enger of the Lord of Ho&s;ts to them. And every one that takes on him the Office of a Mini&s;ter of Chri&s;t as he ought to do, e&s;pou&s;es the Church of Chri&s;t, as he e&s;pou&s;es the Intere&s;t of the Church in a Manner that is peculiar. He is under Obligations, as a Mini&s;ter of the chri&s;tian Church, beyond other Men, to love the Church, as Chri&s;t her true Bride|groom hath loved her, and to prefer <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> above his chief Joy, and to imitate Chri&s;t the great Shepherd and Bi&s;hop of Souls and Hu&s;band of the Church, in his Care and tender Concern for the Church's Welfare, and earne&s;t and con&s;tant Labours to promote it, as he has Opportunity. And as he, in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">aking Office, devotes him&s;elf to the Service of Chri&s;t in his Church; &s;o he gives him&s;elf to the Church, to be hers, in that Love, tender Care, con&s;tant Endeavour, and earne&s;t Labour for her Provi&s;ion, Comfort and Welfare,
<PB N="13" REF="005766_0010_1026E041A940F960">
that is proper to his Office, as a Mini&s;ter of the Church of Chri&s;t, by the Permi&s;&s;ion of divine Providence as long as he lives; as a young Man gives him&s;elf to a Virgin when he marries her. And the Church of Chri&s;t in general, as con&s;tituted of true Saints through the World (tho' they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">on't deliver up them&s;elves to any one particular Mini&s;ter, as univer&s;al Pa&s;tor, yet) do cleave to and embrace the Mi|ni&s;try of the Church with endeared Affection and high Honour and E&s;teem, for Chri&s;t's Sake; and do joyfully commit and &s;ubject them&s;elves to them to cleave to, honour and help them, to be guided by them and obey them &s;o long as in the World; as the Bride doth in Marriage cleave and deliver up her&s;elf to her Hu&s;band. And the Mini&s;try in general, or the whole Number of faithful Mini&s;ters, being all united in the &s;ame Work as Fellow-Labourers, and con|&s;piring to the &s;ame De&s;ign as Fellow-helpers to the Grace of God, may be con&s;idered as one my&s;tical Per&s;on, that e&s;pou&s;es the Church as a young Man e&s;pou&s;es a Virgin: as the many Elders of the Church of <HI>Ephe&s;us</HI> are repre&s;ented as one my&s;tical Per&s;on, <HI>Rev.</HI> 2. 1. and all called the Angel of the Church of <HI>Ephe&s;us:</HI> and as the faithful Mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t in general, all over the World, &s;eem to be repre|&s;ented as one my&s;tical Per&s;on and called an Angel, Rev. 14. 6. <HI>And I &s;aw another Angel fly in the mid&s;t of Heaven, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">aving the everla&s;ting Go&s;pel to preach unto them that dwell upon the Earth, and to every Nation and Kindred and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> and People.</HI> But,</P>

A faithful Mini&s;ter that is in a chri&s;tian Manner united to a chri&s;tian People as their Pa&s;tor, has his Heart united to them in the mo&s;t arden<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> and render Affection: And they, on the other Hand, have their Hearts united to him, e&s;teem|ing him very highly in Love for his Work's Sake, and re|ceiving him with Honour and Reverence, and willingly &s;ubjecting them&s;elves to him, and committing them&s;elves to his Care, as being, under Chri&s;t, their Head and Guide.</P>
<P>And &s;uch a Pa&s;tor and People are like a young Man and Virgin united in Marriage with Re&s;pect to the Purity of their Regard one to another. The young Man gives him|&s;elf to his Bride in Purity, as undebauched by meretricious Embraces: and &s;he al&s;o pre&s;ents her&s;elf to him a cha&s;te Virgin. So in &s;uch an Union of a Mini&s;ter and People as we are &s;peaking of, the Parties united are pure and holy in their Affection and Regard one to another. The Mini|&s;ter's Heart is united to the People, not for filthy Lucre, or any worldly Advantage, but with a pure Benevolence to them, and De&s;ire of their &s;piritual Welfare and Pro&s;perity, and Complacence in them as the Children of God and Followers of Chri&s;t Je&s;us. And on the other Hand, they love and honour him with an holy Affection and E&s;teem; and not meerly as having their Admiration rai&s;ed, and their carnal Affections moved, by having their Ears tickled, and their Curio&s;ity and other fle&s;hly Principles grat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">fied by a florid Eloquence, and the Excellency of Speech and Man's Wi&s;dom; but receiving him as the Me&s;&s;enger of the Lord of Ho&s;ts, coming to them on a divine and infinitely impor|tant Errand, and with tho&s;e holy Qualifications that re&s;em|ble the Vertues of the Lamb of God.</P>
<P>And as the Bridegroom and Bride give them&s;elves to each other in Covenant; &s;o it is in that Union we are &s;peaking of between a faithful Pa&s;tor and a chri&s;tian People. The Mini&s;ter by &s;olemn Vows devotes him&s;elf to the Peo|ple, to improve his Time and Strength, and &s;pend and be

<P N="2">(2.) The Union between a faithful Mini&s;ter and a chri&s;tian People that we are &s;peaking of, is like that between a young Man and Virgin in their Marriage, with Re&s;pect to the <HI>Concomitants</HI> of it.</P>
<P>When &s;uch a Mini&s;ter and &s;uch a People are thus united, it is attended with <HI>great J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">y.</HI> The Mini&s;ter joyfully de|voting him&s;elf to the Service of his Lord in the Work of the Mini&s;try, as a Work that he delights in: and al&s;o joy|fully uniting him&s;elf to the Society of the Saints that he is &s;et over, as having Complacence in them, for his dear Lord's Sake, who&s;e People they are; and willingly and joy|fully, on Chri&s;t's Call, undertaking the Labours and Diffi|culties of the Service of their Souls. And they, on the other Hand, joyfully receiving him as a precious Gift of their a&s;cended Redeemer. Thus a faithful Mini&s;ter and a chri&s;tian People are each other's Joy. Rom. 15. 32. <HI>That I may come unto you with J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">y by the Will of God, and may with you be refre&s;hed.</HI> 2 Cor. 1. 14. <HI>As you have acknowledged us in Part, that we are your rejoicing,</HI> even as ye are ours.</P>
<P>Another Concomitant of this Union, wherein it re&s;em|bles that which becomes a young Man and Virgin united in Marriage, is <HI>mutual Helpfulne&s;s,</HI> and a con&s;tant Care and Endeavour to promote each other's Good and Comfort.

<P>Such a Pa&s;tor and People, as it is between a Couple happily united in a conjugal Relation, have a <HI>mutual Sym|pathy</HI> with each other, a fellow-feeling of each other's Bur|dens and Calamities, and a Communion in each other's Pro&s;perity and Joy. When the People &s;uffer in their &s;piri|tual Intere&s;ts, the Pa&s;tor &s;uffers: he is afflicted when he &s;ees their Souls in Trouble and Darkne&s;s: he feels their Wounds; and he looks on their Pro&s;perity and Comfort as his own. 2 Cor. 11.29. <HI>Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who is offended, and I burn not?</HI> 2 Cor. 7. 13. <HI>We were comforted in your Comfort.</HI> And on the other Hand, the People feel their Pa&s;tor's Burdens, and rejoice in his Pro&s;|perity and Con&s;olations; &s;ee <HI>Phil.</HI> 4. 14. and 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 2. 3.</P>

<P>One Fruit of it is <HI>mutual Benefit:</HI> They become meet Helps one for another.

Cloathing; &s;o the Pa&s;tor, as Chri&s;t's Steward, makes Pro|vi&s;ion for his People, and brings forth out of his Trea&s;ure Things new and old, gives every one his Portion of Meat in due Sea&s;on, and is made the In&s;trument of &s;piritually cloath|ing and adorning their Souls. And on the other Hand, the Mini&s;ter receives Benefit from the People, as they mini&s;ter greatly to his &s;piritual Good by that holy Conver&s;e to which their Union to him as his Flock leads them. The conjugal Relation leads the Per&s;ons united therein to the mo&s;t inti|mate Acquaintance and Conver&s;ation with each other; &s;o the Union there is between a faithful Pa&s;tor and a chri&s;tian People leads them to the intimate Conver&s;ation about Things of a &s;piritual Nature: It leads the People mo&s;t freely and fully to open the Ca&s;e of their Souls to the Pa&s;tor, and leads him to deal mo&s;t freely, clo&s;ely and thoroughly with them in Things pertaining thereto. And this Con|ver&s;ation not only tends to <HI>their</HI> Benefit, but al&s;o greatly to <HI>his.</HI></P>
<P>And the Pa&s;tor receives Benefit from the People out|wardly, as they take Care of and order his outward Accom|modations for his Support and Comfort, and do as it were &s;pread and &s;erve his Table for him.</P>
<P>Another Fruit of this Union wherein it re&s;embles the conjugal Union, is a &s;piritual <HI>Offspring.</HI> There is wont to ari&s;e from the Union of &s;uch a Pa&s;tor and People a &s;piritual Race of the Children of the Congregation that are new|born. The&s;e new-born Children of God are in the Scrip|ture repre&s;ented both as the Children of Mini&s;ters, as tho&s;e that have begotten them through the Go&s;pel, and al&s;o as the Children of the Church, who is repre&s;ented as their Mother that hath brought them forth, and at who&s;e Brea&s;ts they are nouri&s;hed; as in <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 54. 1. and 66. 11. <HI>Gal.</HI> 4. 26. 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 2. 2. and many other Places.</P>

<P N="1">1. The Saints are and &s;hall be the Subjects of this Ble&s;&s;ed|ne&s;s.

The Holy Gho&s;t &s;eems to take a peculiar Delight in this, as a Similitude fit to repre&s;ent the &s;trict, intimate and ble&s;&s;ed Union that is between Chri&s;t and his Saints. The Apo&s;tle intimates that one End why God appointed Marriage, and e&s;tabli&s;hed &s;o near a Relation as that between Hu&s;band and Wife, was that it might be a Type of the Union that is between Chri&s;t and his Church, in Eph. 5. 30, 31, 32. <HI>For we are Members of his Body, of his Fle&s;h, and of his Bones.

This</HI> In&s;titution of Marriage, and making the Man and his Wife <HI>one Fle&s;h,</HI> is a great My&s;tery; <HI>i. e.</HI> it contains in it a great My&s;tery; there is a great and glorious My&s;tery hid in the De&s;ign of it: and the Apo&s;tle tells us what that glorious My&s;tery is, <HI>I speak concerning Chri&s;t and the Church:</HI> as much as to &s;ay, the My&s;tery I &s;peak of, is that ble&s;&s;ed Union that is between Chri&s;t and his Church, which I &s;poke of before.</P>

There are many Mini&s;ters in the Church of Chri&s;t, and there may be &s;everal Pa&s;tors of one particular Church: but the Church has but one Hu&s;band, all others are rejected and de&s;pi&s;ed in Compari&s;on of him; he is among the Sons as the Apple-Tree among the Trees of the Wood; they all are barren and worthle&s;s, he only is the fruitful Tree; and therefore leaving all others, the Church betakes her&s;elf to him alone, and &s;its under his Shadow with great Delight, and his Fruit is &s;weet to her Ta&s;te; &s;he takes up her full and entire Re&s;t in him, de&s;iring no other.

<P>Chri&s;t and his Saints, &s;tanding in &s;uch a Relation as this one to another, the Saints mu&s;t needs be un&s;peakably happy: Their mutual Joy in each other is an&s;werable to the near|ne&s;s of their Relation and &s;trictne&s;s of their Union: Chri&s;t rejoice <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ver the Church as the Bridegroom rejoiceth over the Bride, and &s;he rejoices in him as the Bride rejoices in the Bridegroom.

So Chri&s;t is &s;aid to feed among the Lillies, <HI>Cant.</HI> 2. 16. And Chap. 7. 13. &s;he &s;peaks of <HI>all Manner of plea&s;ant Fruits, new and old, which &s;he had laid up for him;</HI> and &s;ays to him, Chap. 4. 16. <HI>Let my Beloved come into his Garden, and eat his plea&s;ant Fruit:</HI> And he makes An&s;wer in the next Ver&s;e, <HI>I am come into my Garden my Si&s;ter, my Spou&s;e: I have ga|thered my Myrrh with my Spice; I have eaten my Honey-comb, with my Honey; I have drunk my Wine with my Milk.</HI></P>
<P>And la&s;tly, Chri&s;t and his Church, as the Bridegroom and Bride, rejoyce <HI>in conver&s;ing with each other.</HI> The Words of Chri&s;t by which he conver&s;es with his Church, are mo&s;t &s;weet to her; and therefore &s;he &s;ays of him, Cant. 5. 16. <HI>His Mouth is mo&s;t &s;weet.</HI> And on the other Hand, he &s;ays of her, Chap. 2. 14. <HI>Let me hear thy Voice; for &s;weet is thy Voice.</HI> And Chap. 4. 11. <HI>Thy Lips, O my Spou&s;e, drop as the Honey-comb; Honey and Milk are under thy Tongue.</HI></P>
<P>Chri&s;t rejoyces over his Saints as the Bridegroom over the Bride <HI>at all Times:</HI> But there are <HI>&s;ome Sea&s;ons</HI> wherein he doth &s;o more e&s;pecially.

him, in the Day of his E&s;pou&s;als, and in the Day of the Glad|ne&s;s of his Heart.</HI> And 'tis oftentimes remarkably the Day of the Saints rejoycing in Chri&s;t: for then God turns again the Captivity of his elect People, and as it were, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> their Mouth with Laughter, and the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> Tongue with &s;inging; as in <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 126. at the Beginning.

<P>And there are other Sea&s;ons of <HI>&s;pecial Communion</HI> of the Saints with Chri&s;t, wherein Chri&s;t doth in an e&s;pecial Man|ner rejoyce ever his Saints, and as their Bridegroom brings them into his Chambers, that they al&s;o may be glad and re|joyce in him; <HI>Cant.</HI> 1. 4.</P>
<P>But the Time wherein this mutual Rejoycing of Chri&s;t and his Saints will be in its Perfection, is the Time of the Saints <HI>Glorification</HI> with Chri&s;t in Heaven; for that is the proper Time of the Saints entring in with the Bridegroom into the Marriage, <HI>Matth.</HI> 25. 10. The Saint's Conver&s;ion is rather like the betrothing of the intended Bride to her Bridegroom before they come together; but the Time of the Saint's Glorification is the Time when that &s;hall be ful|filled in <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 45. 15. <HI>With Gladne&s;s and Rejoycing &s;hall they be brought; they &s;hall enter into the King's Palace.</HI> That is the Time when tho&s;e that Chri&s;t loved, and gave him&s;elf for, that he might &s;anctify and clean&s;e them, as with the wa&s;hing of Water by the Word, &s;hall be pre&s;ented to him in Glory, not having Spot or Wrinkle, or any &s;uch Thing. The Time wherein the Church &s;hall be brought to the full Enjoyment of her Bridegroom, having all Tears wiped a|way from her Eyes; and there &s;hall be no more Di&s;tance or Ab&s;ence. She &s;hall then be brought to the Entertain|ments of an eternal Wedding-Fea&s;t, and to dwell eternally with her Bridegroom; yea to dwell eternally in his Em|braces.

And as there are various Sea&s;ons wherein Chri&s;t and par|ticular Saints do more e&s;pecially rejoyce in each other; &s;o there are al&s;o certain Sea&s;ons wherein Chri&s;t doth more e&s;|pecially rejoyce over his Church collectively taken. Such a Sea&s;on is a Time of <HI>remarkable Out-pouring of the Spirit of God:</HI> it is a Time of the E&s;pou&s;al of many Souls to Chri&s;t: and &s;o a Time of much of the Joy of E&s;pou&s;als: and al&s;o it is a Time wherein Chri&s;t is won't more e&s;pecially to vi&s;it his Saints with his Loving-kindne&s;s, and to bring them near to him&s;elf, and e&s;pecially to refre&s;h their Hearts with divine Communications: on which Account, &s;uch a Time becomes a Time of great Joy to the Church of Chri&s;t. So when the Spirit of God was &s;o wonderfully pour'd out on the City of <HI>Samaria,</HI> with the Preaching of <HI>Philip,</HI> we read that <HI>there was great Joy in that City,</HI> Act. 8. 8. And the Time of that wonderful Effu&s;ion of the Spirit at <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> begun at the Fea&s;t of <HI>Penteco&s;t,</HI> was a Time of holy Fea&s;ting and Re|joycing, and a Kind of a Wedding-Day to the Church of Chri&s;t; wherein <HI>they continuing daily, with one Accord, in the Temple, and breaking Bread from Hou&s;e to Hou&s;e, did eat their Meat with Gladne&s;s, &amp; Singlene&s;s of Heart;</HI> as Act. 2. 46.</P>
<P>But more e&s;pecially is the Time of that <HI>great Out-pouring of the Spirit of God, in the latter Days,</HI> &s;o often foretold in the Scripture, repre&s;ented as the Time of the Marriage of the Lamb, and of the Rejoycing of Chri&s;t and his Church in each other, as the Bridegroom and the Bride. This is the Time prophe&s;yed of in our Text and Context; and this is the Time foretold in I&s;ai.65.19. <HI>I will rejoyce in Jeru&s;alem, and Joy in my People; and the Voice of Weeping &s;hall no more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e heard in her, nor the Voice of Crying.</HI> This is the Time &s;poken of, Rev. 19. 6,7,8,9. where the Apo&s;tle <HI>John</HI> tells us, <HI>He heard as it were the Voice of a great Multitude, and as the Voice of many Waters, and as the Voice of mighty Thundrings, &s;aying Alleluia; for the Lord God Omnipotent reigneth.

<P N="2">2. That forementioned Union of faithful Mini&s;ters with the People of Chri&s;t, is in order to this Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s.</P>
<P N="1">1. 'Tis only with Reference to Chri&s;t, as the true Bride|groom of his Church, that there is any Union between a faithful Mini&s;ter and a Chri&s;tian People, that is like that of a Bridegroom and Bride.</P>
<P>As I ob&s;erv'd before, a faithful Mini&s;ter e&s;pou&s;es a chri&s;tian People, not in his own Name, but as Chri&s;t's Amba&s;&s;ador: He e&s;pou&s;es them, that in their being e&s;pou&s;ed to him, they may be e&s;pou&s;ed to Chri&s;t; and not that the Church may commit Adultery with him: 'Tis for his Sake that he loves her, with a tender conjugal Affection, as &s;he is the Spou&s;e of Chri&s;t, and as he, as the Mini&s;ter of Chri&s;t, has his Heart under the Influence of the Spirit of Chri&s;t; as <HI>Abraham's</HI> faithful Servant, that was &s;ent to fetch a Wife for his Ma&s;ter's Son, was captivated with <HI>Rebeckah'</HI>s Beauty and Vertue; but not with Reference to an Union with him&s;elf, but with his Ma&s;ter <HI>I&s;aac:</HI> it was for his &s;ake he loved her, and it was for him that he de&s;ired her, and &s;at his Heart upon her, that &s;he might be <HI>I&s;aac'</HI>s Wife: and it was for this that he greatly rejoyced over her, and for this he woo'd her, and for this he obtained her, and &s;he was for a Sea&s;on united to him; but it was but as a Fellow-Traveller, that by him &s;he might be brought to <HI>I&s;aac</HI> in the Land of <HI>Canaan;</HI> and for this he adorned her with Ornaments of Gold; it was to prepare her for <HI>I&s;aac's</HI> Embraces. All that tender Care which a faithful Mini&s;ter takes of his People as a kind of &s;piritual Hu&s;band, to pro|vide for them, to lead and feed them, and comfort them, is not as looking upon them his own Bride, but his Ma&s;ter's.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="005766_0026_102704428EB7FD78">
And on the other Hand, the People receive him, and unite them&s;elves to him in Covenant, and honour him, and &s;ubject them&s;elves to him, and obey him, only for Chri&s;t's Sake, and as one that repre&s;ents him, and acts in his Name towards them. All this Love and Honour and Submi&s;&s;ion is ultimately refer'd to Chri&s;t. Thus the Apo&s;tle &s;ays, Gal. 4. 14. <HI>Ye received me as an Angel,</HI> or Me&s;&s;enger <HI>of God, even as Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</HI> And the Children that are brought forth in Con&s;equence of the Union of the Pa&s;tor and People, are not properly the Mini&s;ter's Children, but the Children of Chri&s;t; they are not born of Man, but of God.</P>
<P N="2">2.

As <HI>Abraham'</HI>s Servant, and the Part he acted as <HI>I&s;aac'</HI>s Agent towards <HI>Rebeckah,</HI> were the principal Means of his being brought to enjoy the Benefits of her conjugal Relation to <HI>I&s;aac.</HI> Mini&s;ters are &s;ent to wooe the Souls of Men for Chri&s;t, 2 Cor. 5.20. <HI>We are then Amba&s;&s;adors for Chri&s;t; as tho' God did you by us; we pray you in Chri&s;t's Stead, be ye reconciled to God.</HI> We read in <HI>Math.</HI> 22. of a certain King, that made a Marriage for his Son, and &s;ent forth his Servants to invite and bring in the Gue&s;ts: 'Tis Mini&s;ters that are the&s;e Ser|vants.

<P>Here I would mention three or four Things tending to excite us to this Fidelity.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="32" REF="005766_0029_102704497512EA00">
1. We ought to con&s;ider how much Chri&s;t has done to obtain that Joy that has been &s;poken of, in order to which we have been called to the Work of the Mini&s;try; <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> that wherein Chri&s;t rejoyces over his Church, as the Bridegroom rejoyceth over the Bride.</P>
<P>The Creation of the World &s;eems to have been e&s;pecially for this End, that the eternal Son of God might obtain a Spou&s;e, towards whom he might fully exerci&s;e the infinite Benevolence of his Nature, and to whom he might, as it were, open and pour forth all that immen&s;e Fountain of Conde&s;cen&s;ion, Love and Grace that was in his Heart, and that in this Way God might be glorified. Doubtle&s;s the Work of Creation is subordinate to the Work at Redemp|tion: that is called the Creation of the new Heavens and <HI>new</HI> Earth, and is repre&s;ented as &s;o much more excellent than the <HI>old,</HI> that <HI>that,</HI> in Comparison of it, is not worthy to be <HI>mention'd,</HI> or <HI> come into Mind.</HI></P>
<P>But Chri&s;t has done greater Things than to create the World, to obtain his Bride and the Joy of his E&s;pou&s;als with her: For he was incarnate, and become Man for this End; which was a greater Thing than his creating the World. For the Creator to <HI>make</HI> the Creature was a great Thing; but for him to <HI>become</HI> a Creature was a greater Thing. And he did a much greater Thing &s;till to obtain this Jo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">; in that for this he laid down his Life, and &s;uffered even the Death of the Cro&s;s: for this he poured out his Soul unto Death, and he that is the Lord of the Univer&s;e, God over all ble&s;&s;ed for evermore, offered up him&s;elf a Sacrifice, in both Body and Soul, in the Flames of divine Wrath. Chri&s;t obtains his elect Spou&s;e by Conque&s;t: for &s;he was a Captive in the Hands of dreadful Enemies; and her Redeemer came into the World to conquer the&s;e Enemies, and re&s;cue her out of their Hands, that &s;he might be his Bride: And he came, and encounter'd the&s;e Enemies in the greate&s;t Battle that ever was beh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ld by Men or Angels: He fought with Prin|cipal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters"> and Powers; He fought alone with the Powers of

Darkne&s;s, and all the Armies of Hell; yea he conflicted with the infinitely more dreadful Wrath of God, and over|came in this great Battle; and thus he obtained his Spou&s;e. Let us con&s;ider at how great a Price Chri&s;t purcha&s;ed this Spou&s;e: He did not redeem her with corruptible Things as Silver and Gold, but with his own precious Blood; yea he gave <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> for her.

<P>The Pro&s;pect of this was what &s;upported him in the mid&s;t of the di&s;mal Pro&s;pect of his Sufferings, at which his Soul was troubled; as appears by the Account we have Joh. 12.

<P>And Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel are appointed to be the In|&s;truments of bringing this to pa&s;s; the In&s;truments of bringing home his elect <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">pou&s;e to him, and her becoming his Bride; and the In&s;truments o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> her &s;anctifying and clean|&s;ing by the Word, that &s;he might be meet to be pre&s;ented to him on the future glorious Wedding-Day.

But this is not that wherein your Duty towards him chiefly lies: The main Thing is to comply with him in his great Errand, and to yield to the Suit that he makes to you in the Name of Chri&s;t, to go to be his Bride. In this you &s;hould be like <HI>Rebekah:</HI> &s;he was from what &s;he heard of <HI>I&s;aac,</HI> S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> God's Covenant with

him, and Ble&s;&s;ing upon him, from the Mouth of <HI>Abraham'</HI>s Servant, willing for ever to for&s;ake her own Country, and her Father's Hou&s;e, to go into a Country &s;he had never &s;een, to be <HI>I&s;aac'</HI>s Wife, whom al&s;o &s;he never &s;aw.

<P>And if your Pa&s;tor be faithful in his Office, and you hearken and yield to him in that great Errand on which Chri&s;t &s;ends him to you, the Time will come, wherein you and your Pa&s;tor will be each others Crown of Rejoycing, and wherein Chri&s;t and he and you &s;hall all meet together at the glorious Marriage of the Lamb, and &s;hall rejoyce in and over one another, with perfect, uninterrupted, never ending and never fading Joy.</P>
