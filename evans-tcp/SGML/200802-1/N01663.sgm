<P>IT is Impo&s;&s;ible to ask a more <HI>Weighty Que&s;ti|on</HI>! It is Deplorable, that we hear it ask'd with no more Frequency, with no more Agony. The <HI>&s;pirit of Slumber</HI> which the <HI>Poi&s;on</HI> of the <HI>Old Serpent</HI> has bro't upon the Children of men, is to be deplored Exceedingly. <HI>Awaken us out of this wonderful Stupidity, O God of all Grace, le&s;t we Peri&s;h wonderfully!</HI></P>
<P>My de&s;ign is to bring in a good &amp; a full An&s;wer to this <HI>Weighty Que&s;tion.</HI> Oh! how Thankful ought we to be, for the <HI>Glorious Go&s;pel of the Ble&s;&s;ed God,</HI> that makes us able to An&s;wer it! The <HI>Go&s;pel</HI> which we have in our hands, tis a Go&s;pel of &s;uch a&s;toni&s;h|ing <HI>My&s;tery,</HI> of &s;uch Heavenly <HI>Maje&s;ty,</HI> and of &s;uch Con&s;ummate <HI>Purity,</HI> that it can be no other than the <HI>Word of God</HI>; It mu&s;t be of a <HI>Divine Original.</HI> Oh! highly Favoured People, who <HI>know</HI> this <HI>Joyful Sound</HI>! Oh! Unavoidably, &amp; Inexcu&s;ably Wretch|ed, if we di&s;regard it!</P>
<P>The Devils knew, That tho&s;e Excellent Mini|&s;ters of the Lord, <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Silas,</HI> were come to <HI>Phi|lippi,</HI> with a De&s;ign to an&s;wer this <HI>Weighty Que&s;tion.</HI>

They could not bear it; they fear'd it would i&s;&s;ue in a De&s;truction upon their <HI>Kingdom</HI> there. They &s;tirr'd up the minds of &s;ome <HI>Wicked People,</HI> to Abu&s;e and Revile the&s;e Mini&s;ters, and run them into Pri&s;on. Some <HI>Wicked People</HI> were afraid, le&s;t they &s;hould lo&s;e a little <HI>Money,</HI> by the coming of &s;uch Mini&s;ters among them; and the <HI>Devils</HI> in|&s;pired tho&s;e Muckworms to u&s;e ince&s;&s;ant Endea|vours, until they had made the&s;e Mini&s;ters uncapa|ble of Preaching any more unto them. Our Glori|ous LORD appeared for His Faithful Servants. They Glorified Him, in the mid&s;t of their Trials. They <HI>Sang His Prai&s;es,</HI> under the <HI>Stripes</HI> &amp; the <HI>Stocks</HI> which the <HI>Satanic Party</HI> inflicted on them. Oh! Patient Servants of the Lord! What a &s;ymptom have you, that you &s;hall one Day <HI>Reign in Glory</HI> with Him! <HI>The&s;e Poor men</HI> Sang <HI>unto the Lord; the Lord heard them, and &s;av'd them</HI>! A terrible <HI>Earth|quake</HI> at Midnight &s;hook open the <HI>Doors</HI> of their Pri&s;on. The Keeper that had the now &s;uper&s;eded <HI>Keyes</HI> of the Pri&s;on, was terrified. In his Con&s;ter|nation, he falls down at the Feet of his <HI>Pri&s;oners</HI>; he treats them no longer as <HI>Pri&s;oners,</HI> but rather as <HI>Angels.</HI> He fervently puts to them the <HI>Que&s;tion,</HI> which, Oh! that it were often heard with an equal Fervency among us! <HI>What mu&s;t I do to be Saved?</HI></P>
<P>Some Learned men think, that the Gaoler had, from the Traditions of their Philo&s;ophers, conceiv|ed &s;ome <HI>Hope of a Better Life</HI>; and &s;eeing his <HI>Life</HI> here in danger, he does, as Di&s;tre&s;s'd Wretches in the la&s;t minutes of their <HI>Life</HI> u&s;e to do, Cry out for &s;ome Help to make &s;ure of a <HI>Better Life.</HI> Or,

more probably, the late words of the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed Young Woman in the Town, about the&s;e Mini|&s;ters; <HI>The&s;e men are the Servants of the mo&s;t High God, who &s;hew unto us the way of Salvation</HI>; might run in his mind, and mind him of <HI>that Salvation,</HI> and make him think, whether the&s;e men were not appointed of God for the In&s;truction of others, in the way to <HI>that Salvation.</HI></P>
<P>There is a mo&s;t important matter, which mu&s;t now be undertaken to be Demon&s;trated;
<Q>That whereas there mu&s;t be Something done, by every man that would be Saved, it &s;hould be the Sollicitous Enquiry of every man, What mu&s;t be done by him, that he may be Saved.</Q></P>
<P>We will proceed upon the Awakening <HI>Demon|&s;trations</HI> of this thing; <HI>Demon&s;trations</HI> more power|ful than any <HI>Thunderbolts.</HI> Oh! that the I&s;&s;ue might be, that the Hearers may be Awakened, with a mighty Impre&s;&s;ion upon their Souls, to make the Enquiry, <HI>What mu&s;t I do to be Saved?</HI></P>
<P N="1"><HI>I.</HI> You mu&s;t Know, That there is a <HI>Great Salva|tion</HI> propo&s;ed unto the &s;inful Children of men; And you mu&s;t Know, and Think, That there is nothing of &s;o <HI>Great Concernment</HI> for any man, as to obtain a part in that <HI>Great Salvation.</HI></P>
<P>Indeed, <HI>Knowlege</HI> is the fir&s;t Thing, that is nece&s;&s;ary in order to <HI>Salvation</HI>; And it is Ab&s;o|lutely <HI>Nece&s;&s;ary,</HI> Un&s;peakably <HI>Nece&s;&s;ary.</HI> We read, Ho&s;. 4.6. of, <HI>People de&s;troy'd for the lack of Know|lege.</HI>

Ah! <HI>Destructive Ignorance</HI>; what &s;hall be done, to cha&s;e thee out of the world! A world, which by thee is rendred a <HI>Dark World,</HI> the <HI>King|dom of Darkne&s;s</HI>! The Oracles of Wi&s;dom, have a&s;&s;ured us; <HI>The Soul without Knowlege is not Good</HI>; They have A&s;&s;ured us; <HI>They who Know not God, &s;hall have a Vengeance, in Flaming Fire, taken of them</HI>; They have a&s;&s;ured us; <HI>Tis Life Eternal, to Know the only true God, and Je&s;us Chri&s;t whom He hath &s;ent.</HI> An <HI>Ignorance</HI> of the <HI>Go&s;pel</HI> is attended with a long Train of Unknown, but very Evil Con&s;equences.

<P>It is not un&s;ea&s;onable here, and as Early as may be, to bring in that Admonition.</P>
<P><HI>Knowlege, Knowlege</HI>; To get <HI>Good Knowlege,</HI> let that be the <HI>Fir&s;t Care</HI> of them that would be <HI>Saved.

of it, mu&s;t be diligently Studied</P>
<P>Unto all the other <HI>Means of Knowlege,</HI> there mu&s;t be added, Humble and Earne&s;t <HI>Supplications</HI> before the Glorious LORD. You mu&s;t <HI>Cry</HI> to God <HI>for Knowlege,</HI> and <HI>lift up your Voice</HI> to Him <HI>for Under&s;tanding</HI>; Prefer it before <HI>Silver,</HI> before any Earthly <HI>Trea&s;ures.</HI></P>
<P>There may be &s;ome &s;o very <HI>Ignorant,</HI> that they know not how to <HI>Pray.</HI> I would advi&s;e them, to take the <HI>Hundred and Nineteenth P&s;alm.</HI> They will find in it, many a Prayer &s;uited unto their Circum|&s;tances. Take it, U&s;e it, and particularly, tho&s;e Petitions in it; <HI>Teach me, O Lord, the way of thy Statutes</HI>; and, <HI>Lord, Teach me Good Judgment &amp; Know|lege</HI>; and, <HI>Lord, Give me &V;nder&s;tanding, that I may know thy Te&s;timonies: Give me &V;nder&s;tanding and I &s;hall Live.</HI> Take Encouragement from that word; and Plead it before the Lord: Jam. 1.5. <HI>If any of you lack Wi&s;dom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men Liberally, and upbraideth not; and it &s;hall be given him.</HI></P>
<P>And now, to pur&s;ue diver&s;e Ends at once, I am to tell you; That the <HI>Main Things</HI> which tis nece&s;|&s;ary for you to Know, are the <HI>Things which concern Salvation.</HI></P>
<P>More Particularly;</P>
<P>You mu&s;t Know, Fir&s;t; <HI>From what</HI> you do need <HI>Salvation.</HI> And here;</P>
<P>Fir&s;t; You are to Know, That the <HI>One</HI> Eternal &amp; Infinite <HI>God,</HI> who Sub&s;i&s;teth in <HI>Three Per&s;ons</HI> (or A&s;pects) which His Word calls, The <HI>Father</HI> &amp; the <HI>Son,</HI> and the <HI>Holy Spirit</HI>; Created our <HI>Fir&s;t Parents,</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="001975_0008_0FBA3A9ACC5CCF68">
in an <HI>Holy and Happy State,</HI> at the End of the <HI>Six Days,</HI> in which He <HI>Created all thing.</HI></P>
<P>But our <HI>Fir&s;t Parents</HI> hearkening to the Tempta|tions of <HI>Wicked Spirits,</HI> did Eat a <HI>Forbidden Fruit</HI>; and by that Sin, they <HI>Fell from God,</HI> and from their Holy and Happy <HI>State</HI>; And their <HI>Fall</HI> has brought their Children with them, into a <HI>State of Sin and Mi&s;ery. Their Sin</HI> was <HI>Our Sin</HI>; From their <HI>Corrupt Nature</HI> we are Born into the world Envenom'd with &s;uch a <HI>Nature.</HI> The <HI>Death</HI> which the <HI>Broken Law of God</HI> threatned unto them, is due to us all: A <HI>Death</HI> which intends <HI>all Mi&s;ery,</HI> not only in <HI>this World,</HI> but in <HI>Another,</HI> where our <HI>Souls</HI> continue <HI>Immortal,</HI> after they have left this world.</P>
<P>Then, You are to Know; That there is a <HI>Law</HI> given to us, which is the <HI>Everla&s;ting Rule,</HI> according to which, God requires us to Glorify Him; a <HI>Law</HI> of <HI>Love</HI> to God and Man, contain'd in our <HI>Ten Commandments.</HI></P>
<P>But, That you <HI>daily Break</HI> this <HI>Law</HI>; and that every <HI>Breach</HI> of it, incurs the <HI>Wrath</HI> of God, who is <HI>of Purer Eyes than to behold Evil, and cannot look upon Iniquity.</HI></P>
<P>La&s;tly, You are to Know, That while you lie under the <HI>Guilt of Sin,</HI> you are al&s;o under the <HI>Reign of Sin</HI>; and under the <HI>Reign of Satan</HI> too; A mo&s;t woful Oppre&s;&s;ion from the wor&s;t Enemies that can be. <HI>God</HI> is in <HI>Ill Terms</HI> with you; He Vi&s;its you not with His <HI>Great Con&s;olations. All things</HI> are a|gain&s;t you; The things that appear mo&s;t for your <HI>Welfare,</HI> do but <HI>En&s;nare</HI> you, do but <HI>Poi&s;on</HI> you, do but produce your further di&s;tance from God.

<P>Ah Sinner; This, This is thy Lamentable Ca&s;e. And Knowing this, how can&s;t thou do any other than make that Sollicitous Enquiry; <HI>What mu&s;t I do to be Saved?</HI> Knowing this <HI>Terror of the Lord,</HI> Oh! be <HI>Per&s;waded.</HI></P>

<P>You are then to Know; That the <HI>Son of God</HI> A&s;|&s;umed the Ble&s;&s;ed JESUS, the Sinle&s;s and Holy Son of a <HI>Virgin,</HI> into One Per&s;on with Him&s;elf.</P>

You mu&s;t Religiou&s;ly Ob&s;erve the <HI>Lords Day.</HI> You mu&s;t pre&s;erve your own <HI>Place,</HI> &amp; <HI>Life,</HI> and <HI>Bed,</HI> and <HI>Wealth,</HI> and <HI>Name</HI>; You mu&s;t with the &s;ame &s;incerity befriend your <HI>Neighbours</HI> al&s;o in <HI>Theirs: Love your Neighbours as your &s;elves.</HI> And, <HI>Do as you would be done unto.</HI> You mu&s;t be e&s;pecially and mightily Con&s;cientious of <HI>Relative Chri&s;tianity</HI>: Carry it well in all the <HI>Relations,</HI> where|in the Lord has placed you, whether <HI>Superiors,</HI> or <HI>Inferiors,</HI> or <HI>Equals</HI>: with &s;uch a Carriage, as may adorn the <HI>Doctrine of God your Saviour</HI>; Such a Car|riage, as may render your <HI>Correlates</HI> the better for you. Briefly, You mu&s;t <HI>Deny all Ungodline&s;s and Worldly Lu&s;ts, and live Godlily, and Soberly and Righ|teou&s;ly in the World.</HI> This is that <HI>Holine&s;s without which no man &s;hall &s;ee the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>Methinks, A mo&s;t Obvious <HI>Inference</HI> may be drawn from the&s;e Things; That the <HI>Mini&s;try of the Go&s;pel</HI> mu&s;t be Attended, and not Neglected, by them who would not <HI>Neglect the Great Salvation</HI>; A mo&s;t awful <HI>Inference,</HI> That it is a Dangerous Thing to Live without the <HI>Means of Salvation,</HI> which are in the <HI>Mini&s;try of the Go&s;pel;</HI> ordinarily to be met withal. The <HI>Wells of Salvation</HI> are kept open in &s;uch a <HI>Mini&s;try.</HI> Oh! Do not undervalue the <HI>Ble&s;|&s;ings</HI> of tho&s;e <HI>Upper Springs</HI>; There are men, who by the Command of a Glorious CHRIST, give them|&s;elves up unto the Service of the <HI>Evangelical Mini|&s;try,</HI> and are the <HI>Preachers of the Go&s;pel</HI> unto the re&s;t

of the world: An <HI>Order</HI> of men concerning whom our Glorious Lord has promi&s;ed, Mat. 28.20. <HI>Lo, I am with you, always to the End of the world.</HI> If an <HI>Angel</HI> &s;hould come from Heaven unto you, as unto <HI>Cornelius</HI> once, to &s;peak unto this Que&s;tion, <HI>What mu&s;t I do to be Saved?</HI> He would unque&s;tionably &s;ay, <HI>Repair to &s;uch a Mini&s;try; Don't think to live without it.</HI></P>
<P>We have &s;ettled the Point; Without <HI>Faith</HI> we can have no <HI>Salvation.</HI> But I a&s;&s;ume; Rom. 10.14, 17. <HI>How &s;hall they Believe in Him of whom they have not heard? And how &s;hall they hear without a Preacher? Faith comes by Hearing, &amp; Hearing by the Word of God.</HI> Oh! That the <HI>&V;ngo&s;pellized Plantations,</HI> which <HI>Live,</HI> I &s;hould rather &s;ay, which <HI>Dy,</HI> without the <HI>Means of Salvation,</HI> would Con&s;ider of it!</P>
<P>Your <HI>Que&s;tion</HI> is An&s;wered. O Souls in Peril, I may now &s;ay unto you; 1 Cor. 15.2. <HI>You are Saved, if you keep in memory what I have Preached unto you.</HI> And yet I mu&s;t &s;ay unto you, That if after all, you Trample upon the&s;e things, it will be <HI>Good for you, that you had never been born</HI>; the very mention of them will dreadfully increa&s;e &amp; inflame your Con|demnation. But the Succe&s;s of all, mu&s;t be left with the Glorious ONE. And, <HI>O Father of Mer|cies, Do thou Mercifully Look down upon the Soul that has heard the&s;e things; Di&s;po&s;e and A&s;&s;i&s;t that Soul, to do tho&s;e Good Things, upon which thou ha&s;t Promi&s;ed the Salvation of the Soul; I Pray thee, I Pray thee!</HI></P>
