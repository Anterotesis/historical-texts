<HEAD>A DISCOURSE TO MARINERS.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>PSALM CVII. 26.</BIBL>
<Q>THEY <HI>mount up to heaven; they go down again to the depths; their &s;oul is melted becau&s;e of trou|ble,</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE pa&s;&s;age I have read to you, is a de&s;crip|tion of a &s;torm, and the effects of it, upon the minds of mariners.</P>
<P>I tru&s;t I need not make an apology for &s;o fre|quently addre&s;&s;ing you upon this affecting &s;ubject. The repeated heavy &s;trokes, we have felt, call for our deepe&s;t humiliation, and therefore for our frequent meditations upon &s;uch awakening providences.</P>
<P>We rejoice, my brethren, to &s;ee &s;o many of you returned to us, after all the dangers you have e&s;caped, and when &s;o many of your companions have been &s;wallowed up in the ocean, who&s;e faces we &s;hall &s;ee no more, till the &s;ea &s;hall give up the dead that are in it.&mdash;We rejoice e&s;pecially to behold you "in the con|gregation of the people (of God), and in the a&s;&s;embly of the elders." We hope the end of your approach|ing the hou&s;e of God is "to prai&s;e him for his good|ne&s;s,
<PB N="6" REF="011939_0003_0F877B3199141310">
for his wonderful works to the children of men, and his providential deliverances of you in particular.</P>
<P>To you e&s;pecially I addre&s;s my di&s;cour&s;e, and may the Father of mercies grant the de&s;ired effect.</P>
<P>"They mount up to heaven; they go down again to the depths; their &s;oul is melted becau&s;e of trouble."</P>
<P>We who dwell on &s;hore, your fathers, your wives and children, often feel for you in &s;uch tempe&s;tuous &s;ea&s;ons, and make your dangers our own. We are deprived of re&s;t by day, and of &s;leep by night, and are ready to conclude, that no employment is &s;o la|borious, and no dangers are &s;o great, as tho&s;e of the the &s;eas; and that, if po&s;&s;ible, &s;ome other method of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence &s;hall be pur&s;ued for the future. This, how|ever, is but a conclu&s;ion drawn up in ha&s;te, without weighing the matter.</P>
<P>There is no calling in life but has its difficulties and troubles. Tho&s;e on the land complain of the hard|&s;hip of &s;ub&s;i&s;ting their families, and will frequently exchange their callings in order to follow the &s;ea. Since the apo&s;tacy from God, trials and dangers are nece&s;&s;ary for us; and as each occupation has its plea|&s;ures, &s;o each has its &s;orrows and burdens too. Tho' following the &s;ea has the greate&s;t proportion of danger and &s;orrow, the wi&s;e Ruler of the world has balanced it with (perhaps) greater advantages and plea&s;ures. When the &s;ea-man determines upon his voyage, future troubles, if they enter his mind, leave no more im|pre&s;&s;ion there, than the &s;hip, in which he fails, does of her path upon the ocean; and he is chearful and gay to a proverb.</P>
<P>With regard to you who are employed in the fi&s;hery,
<PB N="7" REF="011939_0004_0F877B326B312100">
a large proportion of your time is &s;pent on &s;hore, and providence gives you the opportunity of rejoicing with your families and friends; an interview, the delights of which are &s;weetened by ab&s;ence and long &s;eparation from each other.</P>
<P>When the winter is over and gone, weary of an in|active life, and in hopes of &s;ucking of the abundance of the &s;eas, you long to depart. Joy &s;its upon every countenance at the alacrity with which you exert your|&s;elves in preparing for your voyage; and if heaven &s;miles upon your undertaking, none have more cau&s;e to rejoice than your&s;elves. A moderate &s;ea&s;on, a plea|&s;ant &s;un, and fair winds, ha&s;ten your preparation. The time at la&s;t arrives, and your wives and children, with tears of tenderne&s;s, take their leave. You weigh an|chor, and &s;et &s;ail, while the multitude give you their ble&s;&s;ing, and pray for your &s;ucce&s;sful return.</P>
<P>You have now launched forth upon the wide and boi&s;terous ocean, and there is an uncertainty in all worldly affairs, and trouble may come upon you be|fore you are aware.</P>
<P>"The God in who&s;e hand your breath is, and who&s;e are all your ways," has the command of the wind and of the &s;eas. In order to convince men of their dependance on him, he &s;hoots many arrows from his quiver at tho&s;e who dwell on the land. This you have been mo&s;t &s;en&s;ibly affected with, when, upon your late return, you found &s;o many of your dear children not only wounded, but &s;lain by them.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A mortal &s;ickne&s;s prevailed among the children.</NOTE></P>
<P>Storms and tempe&s;ts are his u&s;ual methods of re|proof and puni&s;hment to tho&s;e who do bu&s;ine&s;s on the mighty waters. I have ob&s;erved to you, that my
<PB N="8" REF="011939_0005_0F877B32E7532380">
text de&s;cribes a &s;torm, and &s;hows us how mariners are affected with it. Ah! how altered? we can &s;carcely believe they are the &s;ame men!</P>
<P>Whatever rea&s;on may &s;ugge&s;t would be the conduct of tho&s;e who behold the wonders of God in the deep, experience mu&s;t force us to own the too melancholy truth, that of all men they are mo&s;t addicted to a con|ver&s;ation and conduct, which every rational creature ought to avoid as its bane. We are &s;orry to &s;ay, that oaths and profanene&s;s abound among them, which in &s;ome is carried to &s;uch a length as to place them&s;elves, as it were, in the throne of God, dealing out his judg|ments as though they had "an arm like God, and could thunder with a voice like him."</P>
<P>No wonder the children of &s;uch parents imitate their vices, and when they return from their voyages have learnt to cur&s;e and damn their younger brothers. The&s;e are the youth that are to act upon the &s;tage when we are dead and gone! the&s;e are the children that have been given up to God in bapti&s;m, and whom their parents have mo&s;t &s;olemnly vowed, in the pre|&s;ence of God and man, to bring up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord! Oh! publi&s;h it not in Gath! proclaim it not in A&s;kelon! ble&s;&s;ed be God that this is not more common among us, and that &s;o many of our children remember their creator in the days of their youth.</P>
<P>To return to my text, "They mount up to heaven; they go down again to the depths; their &s;oul is melted becau&s;e of trouble." The &s;ky, which looked &s;erene and fair, gathers blackne&s;s: The winds, which were moderate, ri&s;e and blow with violence: The &s;ea, which was as &s;mooth as gla&s;s, to&s;&s;es its waves moun|tains
<PB N="9" REF="011939_0006_0F877B33AC004458">
high: The night comes on: The &s;torm increa|&s;es: The winds rage: The rain beats upon you, and the &s;ea is ready to &s;wallow you up: "you reel to and fro, and &s;tagger like a drunken man;" "are at your wit's end," and "your &s;ouls melt within you becau&s;e of trouble." Oh! who can de&s;cribe how great that trouble is? your hearts can paint it in more lively colours than I am capable of. This, however, is ap|parent, that different tempers are affected different ways, according to their peculiar circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>In pro&s;ecuting this &s;ubject, I &s;hall enumerate &s;ome of tho&s;e troubles, under which your hearts were ready to melt, and then &s;how the improvement you ought to make of the&s;e things.</P>
<P>"Doubtle&s;s you were not unaffected with the troubles, which you &s;aw your neighbours, your friends and your relations in." Though your own troubles were great, yet when you &s;aw them to&s;&s;ed up to heaven, then &s;inking into the depths, your hearts were filled with &s;orrow for them. On one &s;ide of you, was a near and dear companion; on the other &s;ide, a kind father, or a beloved &s;on; or, it may be, many rela|tions and friends in the &s;ame ve&s;&s;el. They put out &s;ignals of di&s;tre&s;s, importuning your a&s;&s;i&s;tance, but importuning it in vain. Or they might be &s;o near as to call to you, and in the bitterne&s;s of their &s;ouls be|&s;eech you, in God's name, and in the name of Chri&s;t, to lend them &s;ome a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Oh &s;ave us! we peri&s;h! we all peri&s;h!&mdash;When men are brought into &s;uch ex|tremities as the&s;e, they &s;eldom think how little their friends are able to do for them; and though they have called in vain, they call again and again, and cannot take a denial! Oh how mu&s;t your hearts melt within
<PB N="10" REF="011939_0007_0F877B3456A948E8">
you! how mu&s;t your bowels yearn towards them&mdash;you cry in di&s;tre&s;s and agony, <Q>Behold! they &s;ink! they are gone&mdash;gone to the bottom! Lord have mercy on them! Oh! what will become of their poor &s;ouls: they are going into the pre&s;ence of the &s;upreme judge&mdash;into his pre&s;ence, before whom we our&s;elves may &s;oon appear. The next &s;ea may prove as fatal to us. Oh! what wretches we are? how unfit to appear before the tribunal of God&mdash;how unworthy of his mercy?&mdash;The&s;e (perhaps &s;ome of you might have rea&s;on to &s;ay within your|&s;elves) were our companions in &s;in: and Oh! what lives have we lived together? how often have we been companions in drunkenne&s;s&mdash;companions in debauchery&mdash;companions in &s;abbath-breaking, in gaming, and in profane &s;wearing? We have cur&s;ed and damned one another, and dared the Almighty to execute his threatened vengeance upon us. Oh! what has become of my companions, and what will become of me?</Q> In this re&s;pect your &s;ouls have been ready to melt within you.</P>
<P>Another of you may have thus reflected within him|&s;elf: <Q>Alas! my child, my dear child, is gone, clean gone for ever! had I &s;et a good example before him, had I in&s;tructed him in the principles of the chri&s;tian religion, and had I prayed to God for him, the circum&s;tances of his death would have been le&s;s &s;hocking;</Q> and we tru&s;t, my brethren, that this has been the ca&s;e with &s;ome of you, and that you have good hope and chri&s;tian con&s;olation in the death of your children; but this is far from being the ca&s;e with wicked parents of wicked children, (we hope there are but few &s;uch.) Oh how mu&s;t their hearts melt within them, when they are &s;natched away from
<PB N="11" REF="011939_0008_0F877B351723D400">
their eyes in &s;o &s;udden a manner! "O my &s;on Ab&s;a|lom, my &s;on, my &s;on Ab&s;alom; would God I had died for thee, O Ab&s;alom, my &s;on, my &s;on!"</P>
<P>"Again, the hearts of others of you were ready to melt within you becau&s;e of trouble of another kind." It is more than probable that your dangers reminded you of the circum&s;tances of your families at home. Tho&s;e, whom we tenderly love, are not ea&s;ily forgot. It is reported of a pirate, that before he would &s;uffer any man, who was &s;o unhappy as to fall into his hands, to be put to death, he fir&s;t enquired of him, have you a wife or children on &s;hore? if he an&s;wered in the af|firmative, I al&s;o, &s;ays he, with tears in his eyes, have a wife and one dear child, and for their &s;akes I forgive you, go in peace. If per&s;ons of &s;o abandoned a cha|racter are not dive&s;ted of natural affection, we may with rea&s;on expect the mo&s;t tender emotions in tho&s;e who have not run to &s;uch exce&s;s of wickedne&s;s. When you were in trouble for your&s;elves, it is probable, among other things, you were in trouble for your fa|milies. You wi&s;hed you could have one more inter|view with them. <Q>Oh! my dear wife, my dear lit|tle children, that I could but once &s;ee you again! never would I grieve my companion by a profane or wicked conduct, but live with her as a joint heir of the grace of life! Oh my dear children, that I could but &s;ee you again, to coun&s;el and warn you, to in&s;truct and pray to God for you; but wretch that I am, what will my prayers avail, who have neg|lected this duty all my life long till now that God has over whelmed my &s;oul with &s;orrow? Oh that my family knew my di&s;tre&s;s, but I mu&s;t be &s;natched from them without an opportunity to take my la&s;t
<PB N="12" REF="011939_0009_0F877B35D88B7280">
farewell! there are but a few hours between me and eternity! may God be a father to my poor father|le&s;s children, and a hu&s;band to my widow!</Q>&mdash;In this re&s;pect your &s;ouls have been ready to melt within you.</P>
<P>"Again, many of you have been in trouble, more e&s;pecially for your own &s;ouls." When men are in pro&s;perity, they are apt to be forgetful of God. Young per&s;ons, in particular, are prone to rejoice in their youth, and to walk after the imagination of their own hearts, and &s;ight of their own eyes. I fear this has been the ca&s;e with many of you. You have drank in iniquity like water, and tempted your companions to the &s;ame conduct, and wondered that they would not "run to the &s;ame exce&s;s of riot." When you did the&s;e things, God kept &s;ilence. He did not frown up|on you in his providence; and becau&s;e &s;entence was not executed upon you, your hearts were fully &s;et with|in you to do wickedly; but now the voice of this providence to you is this, "thou fool, this night thy &s;oul &s;hall be required of thee", and you are reminded, in a mo&s;t affecting manner, "that for all the&s;e things God will bring you into judgment."</P>
<P>Once you thought the Lord did not &s;ee, neither did the God of Jacob regard it. The &s;ins you kept &s;e|cret from men, you vainly imagined were &s;ecreted from God al&s;o.</P>
<P>Once you thought there was time enough to repent of the follies of youth; and when you were reminded of the uncertainty of life, and certainty of death, and were urged to &s;eek an intere&s;t in Chri&s;t, your language was, go your way for this time, at a more convenient &s;ea&s;on I will hear you of this matter.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="011939_0010_0F877B369AE63EE8">
Chri&s;t and all his glories were &s;et before you, and you have often heard it declared in this a&s;&s;embly, from the &s;acred bible, by the amba&s;&s;adors of Chri&s;t, in a mo&s;t &s;olemn manner, "he that believeth, and is bap|ti&s;ed, &s;hall be &s;aved;" and "he that believeth, not, &s;hall be damned;" but neither the hopes of &s;alvation, nor the fears of damnation, made any abiding im|pre&s;&s;ion on your &s;inful hearts.</P>
<P>Your parents prayed (we hope) in &s;ecret to God for you, and reproved you with tears of pity in their eyes; but you hated in&s;truction, and would none of their reproof. You thought there was no occa&s;ion of troubling your&s;elves about the&s;e things, and that you &s;hould e&s;cape as well as others, though you never &s;e|riou&s;ly con&s;idered how: But now you find your mi&s;|take, and that "it is a mo&s;t fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God."</P>
<P>"You mount up to heaven; you go down again to the depths: Your &s;oul is melted becau&s;e of trouble." Every &s;ea you &s;hip makes your condition more and more dreadful: You throw the ve&s;&s;el up, to the mer|cy of the wind and waves, and let her drive. Oh! the angui&s;h of &s;uch poor &s;ouls! recollect your own thoughts in &s;uch &s;ea&s;ons of di&s;tre&s;s. <Q>Oh what a life have I lived? what a poor thoughtle&s;s creature have I been? how little value have I &s;et upon my pre|cious and immortal &s;oul? but now, ah now! I &s;ee it is of more value than a thou&s;and worlds! Oh that I had but one hour more to live, that I might repent, that I could hear one more go&s;pel &s;ermon, and have one more offer of Chri&s;t; but it is too late for me, for my days are near fini&s;hed, and I am going to give up an account of my&s;elf to God&mdash;an
<PB N="14" REF="011939_0011_0F877B3835CD7000">
account of my mi&s;pent time&mdash;of my abu&s;ed privi|leges of all my talents! Oh how &s;hall I hold up my head? how &s;hall I meet my judge? how &s;hall I an&s;wer him for one of a thou&s;and of my &s;ins, when I &s;tand before his tribunal?</Q></P>
<P>In this di&s;tre&s;s and bitterne&s;s of &s;oul, you cried unto the Lord. If you never prayed before, you then prayed and cried, and be&s;ought the Lord to have mercy upon you, though at the eleventh hour! Jo|nah's mariners, though heathen, called upon their gods; and doubtle&s;s you called upon the God of heaven, whom the winds and &s;eas obey; and you called upon him in a mo&s;t importunate manner.&mdash;<Q>Lord have mercy on us, Lord &s;ave us, we peri&s;h! Oh &s;pare our lives. We will repent, we will reform, a will for&s;ake our &s;ins! Oh have mercy on us: for Chri&s;t's &s;ake, &s;ave our &s;ouls. Lord Je&s;us, have mercy on us!</Q></P>
<P>Well, my brethren, God has delivered you out of all the&s;e troubles. When you cried unto him in your troubles, and he brought you out of your di&s;tre&s;s, "he made the &s;torm a calm, &s;o that the waves thereof were &s;till." Then you were glad, becau&s;e you were quiet, &s;o he has brought you to your de&s;ired haven;" and here you are, this day, pre&s;ent before the Lord, in his hou&s;e!</P>
<P>Oh look around in this a&s;&s;embly, and &s;ee&mdash;Oh! where are your companions gone? Where are tho&s;e who frequented this hou&s;e of wor&s;hip? Where are tho&s;e that were your companions in diver&s;ion at home, and afterwards your companions in &s;orrow and trouble?
<PB N="15" REF="011939_0012_0F877B3A1B8EDAF8">
&mdash;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">By as correct an account as could be taken, which was publi&s;hed in the E&s;&s;ex Gazette, January 2, 1770, it appears, that from January 1768, to January 1770, this town has lo&s;t 23 fail of ve&s;&s;els, and all the men belonging to them, amounting to 162, be&s;ides a con&s;iderable number who were wa&s;hed over from ve&s;&s;els that returned. They have left 70 widows, and 155 children.&mdash;The lo&s;s of intere&s;t was computed to be &pound;. 14124-8-5, L. M.</NOTE> Upwards of one hundred and fifty of them are gone to their long home, who have left &s;ixty &s;orrow|ful widows, and one hundred and thirty-three father|le&s;s children, many of whom are in want of bread: And it is a day of darkne&s;s with us &s;till! We know not, but have rea&s;on to fear, that others are added to this number. How affecting is that pa&s;&s;age of I&s;ai. v. 25. if applied to our ca&s;e? "The anger of the Lord is kindled again&s;t his people, and he hath &s;tretch|ed forth his hand again&s;t them, and hath &s;mitten them; but for all this, his anger is not turned away, but his hand is &s;tretched out &s;till!"</P>
<P>You who have returned to us, have more than double rea&s;on to remember the di&s;pen&s;ations of provi|dence towards this place. Your hearts mu&s;t &s;till feel the impre&s;&s;ions that were made upon them, when you were abroad; and now you are at home, wherever you turn your eyes, you mu&s;t be reminded of what God has delivered you from. You are in particular this day reminded of all the&s;e things&mdash;of your dan|gers&mdash;of your vows&mdash;of the bitterne&s;s of your &s;ouls, and of the goodne&s;s of God in bringing you to your de&s;ired haven.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="011939_0013_0F877B3A7AD318E8">
Oh that we could &s;o remind you of the&s;e things as to &s;peak not only to your ears, but to your hearts! we would "impart to you, not the go&s;pel of God only, but our own &s;ouls." Permit me, on this occa|&s;ion, to u&s;e the words of the Apo&s;tle, "My little children, we travail in birth again, 'till Chri&s;t be formed in your &s;ouls." Oh let us not labour in vain, and &s;pend our &s;trength for nought. See therefore tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture in Jerem. vii. 2, 3. connected with 1 Chron. xxviii. 9. "Hear the word of the Lord, all ye of Judah that enter in at the&s;e gates to wor&s;hip the Lord. Thus faith the Lord of Ho&s;ts, the God of I&s;rael, amend your ways and your doings, and I will cau&s;e you to dwell in this place. Know thou the God of thy father, and &s;erve him with a perfect heart."&mdash;"If thou &s;eek him, he will be found of thee; but if thou for&s;ake him, he will ca&s;t thee off forever."&mdash;Oh, therefore, "prai&s;e the Lord for his goodne&s;s, exalt him in the congregation of the people, and prai&s;e him in the a&s;&s;embly of the elders."</P>
<P>It is ob&s;erved in 1 Pet. iii. 19. that Chri&s;t "preach|ed to the &s;pirits that were in pri&s;on," that is, he preached to tho&s;e that were then dead, by Noah, whom he in&s;pired to be a preacher of righteou&s;ne&s;s, giving warning to the old world of the judgments of God that were approaching. You may remember, that, in my farewell di&s;cour&s;e to you, I had &s;uch a pa&s;&s;age as this: <Q>You are now upon a dangerous voyage. God only knows who of you will ever return.&mdash;Your wives may &s;oon become widows, and your children, fatherle&s;s. Should this be the ca&s;e, it would not be uncommon. We hope for the be&s;t, but prepare your&s;elves for the wor&s;t. As &s;oon for|get

your compa&s;s as your bible. It will direct you to Chri&s;t. It is Chri&s;t that is the propitiation for &s;in. It mu&s;t be Chri&s;t in you, the hope of glory.</Q></P>
<P>Many of tho&s;e, to whom the&s;e words were addre&s;&s;ed, are now dead and gone&mdash;gone to the world of &s;pirits, and they know the va&s;t importance of an intere&s;t in the Redeemer's purcha&s;e; and was it po&s;&s;ible for the dead to preach to the living, they would declare to you, that without an intere&s;t in Chri&s;t you are eter|nally undone! and oh how importunate would they be with you, to embrace the go&s;pel offers of Chri&s;t, who giveth eternal life to as many as believe! You will find the go&s;pel as true, as tho' your friends aro&s;e from the dead, appeared in this a&s;&s;embly, and preach|ed it to you. Suffer me then to urge your acceptance of an offered Saviour: accept of him as your prophet, as your prie&s;t, and as your king. The well being of your &s;ouls for a va&s;t eternity depends upon this. Oh think not that, as your dangers are over and pa&s;t, you may be as thoughtle&s;s and &s;ecure as ever; for the time may come, when that dreadful threatening, Prov. i. 24. and onwards, may be executed upon you: "Becau&s;e I have called, and ye have refu&s;ed, I have &s;tretched out my hand, and no man regarded; but ye have &s;et at nought my council, and would none of my reproof; I al&s;o will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your fear cometh; when your fear cometh as de&s;olation, and your de&s;truction as a whirl|wind; when di&s;tre&s;s and angui&s;h come upon you, then &s;hall ye call upon me, but I will not an&s;wer; ye &s;hall &s;eek me early, but ye &s;hall not find me."</P>
<P>Connected with faith in Chri&s;t, is a reformation of life. "If any man be in Chri&s;t, he is a new creature:"
<PB N="18" REF="011939_0015_0F877B3C95EDCCD0">
And have you not re&s;olved, and this with tears and vows, that you would reform and live as new men? Perform now unto the Lord your vows&mdash;the vows and promi&s;es you made when your &s;ouls were melted with &s;orrow. If you forget them, God will not for|get, for they are all wrote down in his book&mdash;in that book which will be opened, when the dead, &s;mall and great, &s;hall &s;tand before God, and be judged out of tho&s;e things which are written in the books according to their works.</P>
<P>I know, my brethren, the temptations you labour under. Should you but mention it to your compa|nions, that you intend for the future to live &s;oberly, righteou&s;ly and godly, in this pre&s;ent evil world, they would laugh you to &s;corn, and you would have a trial of cruel mocking; for if they called the ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e Belzebub, much more tho&s;e of his hou&s;hold. But though you may be derided as religious fools, we hope you will di&s;dain their frowns. A companion of, fools &s;hall be de&s;troyed. "Oh my &s;oul, come not thou into their &s;ecret; mine honor, unto their a&s;&s;em|bly be not thou united."</P>
<P>We hope we &s;hall hear no more cur&s;ing or profane|ne&s;s, from your mouths; but that you will rather re|prove tho&s;e, who&s;e tongues are "full of deadly poi|&s;on," who, when they "ble&s;s God, even the father, cur&s;e men who are made after the &s;imilitude of God."</P>
<P>In&s;tead of &s;pending your time in tho&s;e unmanly games, which di&s;grace our children in the &s;treets, we tru&s;t you will be &s;eriou&s;ly concerned for the &s;alvation of your &s;ouls.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="011939_0016_0F877B3E9B3827A8">
Live with your companions as joint heirs of the grace of life. Wor&s;hip God in your hou&s;es, and bring up your children in the fear of God, in&s;tructing them in the doctrines of the go&s;pel, praying to God for them, and &s;etting a good example before them; and may God grant, you and them, his &s;alvation.</P>
<P>All in this a&s;&s;embly, both hu&s;bands and wives, pa|rents and children, ma&s;ters and &s;ervants, ought to make a &s;uitable improvement of the&s;e di&s;pen&s;ations of di|vine providence. We have, all of us, to perform the voyage of life. We have embarked, weighed anchor, and &s;et &s;ail, and are bound to eternity. We are ex|po&s;ed to rocks and to quick&s;ands, to &s;torms and tem|pe&s;ts. God grant that none of us make &s;hipwreck of a good con&s;cience, left we &s;uffer the lo&s;s, not of our lives only, but of our &s;ouls.</P>
<P>We tru&s;t you will be as pilots to your brethren, who, though they have e&s;caped de&s;truction by the &s;torms at &s;ea, are expo&s;ed to another kind of &s;torm,&mdash;to a &s;torm of temptation. You will caution them again&s;t their danger; you will councel, advi&s;e and a&s;&s;i&s;t them.</P>
<P>The widows and children of tho&s;e, who&s;e hu&s;bands and fathers have literally &s;uffered &s;hipwreck, are not in&s;en&s;ible of your kindne&s;s, in your intended liberality to them, this day. They will ri&s;e up and call you ble&s;&s;ed. It is not to them, alone, you give; it is to the father of the fatherle&s;s, to the hu&s;band and judge of the widow. Humility indeed is afraid to indulge the thought! "When &s;aw I thee hungry or thir&s;ty, or naked, or &s;ick, or in pri&s;on, and mini&s;tred unto thee?" To whom our Lord replies, Ina&s;much as ye
<PB N="20" REF="011939_0017_0F877B3F45436D68">
have done it to one of the le&s;t of the&s;e my di&s;ciples, ye have done it unto me." The mite of a poor wi|dow &s;hall be remembered to the end of the world, and "a cup of cold water only, given to a di&s;ciple, in the name of a di&s;ciple, &s;hall not lo&s;e its reward."</P>
<P>The lo&s;&s;es you have &s;u&s;tained, I know, are heavy; the town having &s;uffered &pound;. 12-944-1-6, be&s;ides what has been added &s;ince this account was taken; but you will remember what the Apo&s;tle &s;ays to the Corinthi|ans, 2 Cor. viii. 1. when he was forwarding a con|tribution for the poor Chri&s;tians of Judea: He recom|mends to them, the example of the Macedonians, in the&s;e words: "Brethren, we do you to wit, (or we inform you,) of the grace of God, be&s;towed on the churches of Macedonia; how that, in a great trial of affliction, the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty, abounded unto the riches of their liberality, for unto their power, (I bear record) yea, and beyond their power, they were willing of them&s;elves"&mdash;wil|ling to do the mo&s;t generous things for the good of their fellow chri&s;tians in want&mdash;willing without in|treaties and importunity. Let us remember that "he who &s;oweth &s;paringly, &s;hall reap al&s;o &s;paringly; and he who &s;oweth bountifully, &s;hall reap al&s;o boun|tifully."</P>
<P>We hope, brethren, that your zeal will provoke very many, when our circum&s;tances are more gene|rally known. Contributions in the churches were common even in the days of the Apo&s;tles. "Touch|ing mini&s;tring to the &s;aints, it is &s;uperfluous, &s;ays he, for me to write to you. I &s;hall not attempt to excite you to forward this, for I know the readine&s;s of your minds.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="011939_0018_0F877B40F05F54D0">
May God humble us under the heavy &s;trokes of his providence. We have been a mo&s;t provoking peo|ple. May we be &s;o humbled under his mighty hand, that "in his own due time we may be exalted."&mdash;Whatever our outward circum&s;tances are, happy &s;hall we be, if we fly to the hope &s;et before us in the go&s;|pel, which, as in Heb. vi. 19, with which I conclude, "is as an anchor to the &s;oul, both &s;ure and &s;teadfa&s;t, entering into that within the vail."</P>
