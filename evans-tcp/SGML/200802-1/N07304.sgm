Di&s;ea&s;e and Infection have been auxiliaries to the wide wa&s;ting Sword; and innumerable unknown di&s;a&s;ters have concurred in depopulating mankind. Scarcity and Famine have combined in the general ruin; while, either the fury of men hath de&s;troyed the means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence; or GOD, to puni&s;h their crimes, hath withheld the fertility of the Earth, and given &s;ucce&s;&s;ive &s;ea&s;ons of drougth and barrenne&s;s. But it is impo&s;&s;i|ble to collect the materials of calamity, or even for the imagi|nation to comprehend them all; as they have appeared in all parts of the world, during the whole continuance of the war. If we our&s;elves have &s;een le&s;s of the&s;e di&s;tre&s;&s;es, than other coun|tries, or than other parts of our own; if we have known them ra|ther by report than experience; this &s;hould be con&s;idered as our &s;ingular felicity, an unmerited di&s;tinction in our favour, that &s;hould excite the warme&s;t emotions of prai&s;e and thankfulne&s;s.</P>

Thus, Philo&s;ophers have demon&s;trated, that the mechanical effect of what is called Attrac|tion, in the &s;y&s;tem of the world, would be the de&s;truction of the &s;y&s;tem; did not an omnipotent mind &s;o attemper tho&s;e irregu|larities, as to maintain the order of the univer&s;e.

<P>THE general advantages of Peace are too obvious to need a recital: whether as putting an end to the calamities of a &s;tate of War; or as attended with Tranquillity and Opulence, Free|dom, Science, and the Arts that are nece&s;&s;ary or ornamental to &s;ocial life.

Our Country hath been, from its fir&s;t &s;ettlement, a di&s;puted prize between us and our rivals the French. Other nations too have put in their claims among us, and have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the fine&s;t territories on the Continent; which have been ceded to us by &s;everal treaties.

The inju&s;tice of France led them, prematurely for their own purpo&s;e, but providentially for our &s;afety, to anticipate the war by incroaching on our &s;ettlements in a time of profound Peace. They had, with every art of human policy, formed the ambitious plan, of &s;urrounding and limiting our territory, with the view of more ea&s;ily invading and di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing us: and they had pro|ceeded &s;o far in the <HI>execution</HI> that, to all appearance, they had not left it in our power to prevent it, by the utmo&s;t exertion of <HI>our own</HI> &s;trength.

<P>WHEN we thus reflect on the many civil advantages to our Continent, and to the whole Briti&s;h empire, re&s;ulting from a war &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully conducted, and terminated by &s;o beneficial a Peace; we cannot but wonder at that &s;pirit of faction, murmuring, and in&s;atiable political avarice, which amid&s;t the&s;e ample glories, &s;till repines for more; and clamours for yet greater acce&s;&s;ions of wealth and territory. This is wor&s;e than di&s;loyalty to a mo&s;t excellent King; it is an impious ingratitude to the providence of GOD. Too much of this ill temper; (the popular effect of an overgrown pro&s;perity, which kicks again&s;t the hand that feeds it) has prevailed in our mother-Country: where the only danger to Liberty is from its own exce&s;&s;es. May heaven avert from us the infatuation of di&s;cord, repining, and di&s;af|fection!

<P>THERE is indeed &s;ome cloud over the happy face of things on this continent, from the commotions of the Southern <HI>In|dians</HI>; which, like a baleful &s;moke, have ari&s;en from the a&s;hes of the recent war. But if we may be permitted to conjecture the effect of the&s;e incur&s;ions; we may hope and tru&s;t in the divine goodne&s;s, that they will eventually complete the public tranquillity: either by obliging the Indians to <HI>recede,</HI> from our frontiers; or, by preventing their <HI>communication</HI> with the French; or la&s;tly, by what is of all the mo&s;t de&s;irable, a <HI>firm treaty of Peace</HI> with them. Such a treaty might a&s;certain their territory, and lead them to a &s;tate of civility and &s;ettlement; it might induce them to throw them&s;elves on the humanity of our nation, and to learn from us the arts of life; it might open the way to an equitable and mutually beneficial commerce. Their experience of our national humanity, ju&s;tice, and fair dealing, would conciliate their confidence and good opinion: and this would go a great way towards recommending the Go&s;pel to their reception. If they are not introduced to the knowledge of it by the&s;e previous &s;teps of humanity, commerce, and &s;ocial life; I think it mu&s;t for ever be impracticable to fix on their minds any rational and la&s;ting impre&s;&s;ions of the Chri&s;tian Religion.

Great things might be expect|ed, &s;hould the pre&s;ent Indian war be happily terminated by treaties of Peace and Commerce, with an expre&s;s &s;tipulation in regard to Religion. If they are thus brought under the protection of our King; the civil power and humanity of the nation may lead the way, by all the &s;teps before traced out, to introduce with authority and influence &s;uch a &s;y&s;tem of Religion, as may be not only rationally taught, but rationally heard and learned. Other methods, particularly that of Schools and Seminaries for the Indian Youth, may be made very u&s;eful, in &s;ub&s;erviency to a royal and national encouragement. The Royal favour has been extended, among us, to &s;eats of Learn|ing commodiou&s;ly placed for this purpo&s;e.

<P>THERE is no in&s;tance, wherein the providence of GOD ap|pears more con&s;picuous in educing good from evil, than in o|verruling the events of War to the &s;upport and propagation of true Religion. As the <HI>moral</HI> government of the univer&s;e mu&s;t be ever the main object of a divine admini&s;tration; I think it certain, that the great revolutions in the hi&s;tory of mankind, have, either in the way of favour or puni&s;hment, been mainly &s;ub&s;ervient to maintain or extend the influence of Religion. That the events of Arms and fortunes of Empire, have been always determined by the pre&s;cience and &s;upreme power of GOD; appears with the fulle&s;t evidence from the many prophecies of Scripture, and their hi&s;torical completion: and that conque&s;t and dominion have been the providential means of diffu&s;ing Truth and Religion over the world, may be &s;hewn from ancient and recent facts.</P>
<P>THE victories of ALEXANDER were &s;o &s;wift, that he rather flew than marched: as the prophet Daniel characterizes him, <HI>he had the wings of an eagle, and he touched not the ground</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">DAN. VII. 6. VIII. 5.</NOTE>. The effect of his rapid conque&s;t of the Ea&s;t, was a revolution as great in religion as in Empire.

parts of A&s;ia. And the fir&s;t tran&s;lation of the Scriptures, the only pandect of true religion, had great effects even on gentile man|ners and philo&s;ophy.</P>
<P>THE Roman Empire, under AUGUSTUS, extended it&s;elf over all the civilized and many barbarous parts of the world. It was, in the &s;tile of Daniel, <HI>'dreadful and terrible and &s;trong ex|ceedingly, and conquered the whole Earth</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">DAN.

<P>AFTERWARDS, when Religion was &s;ufficiently nurtured in the &s;chool of Adver&s;ity and Per&s;ecution under the Roman tyrants; GOD rai&s;ed up the great CONSTANTINE, to e&s;tabli&s;h the Chri&s;tian Faith throughout the empire. The victories of that Prince fixed the Church of CHRIST in that peaceful and pro&s;perous &s;tate, which is perhaps meant by that noble de&s;cription in St. John's apocalyp&s;e, <HI>of a great multitude</HI> converted to the Faith, <HI>of all nations and tongues, &s;tanding before the throne,</HI> hymning <HI>Salva|tion to our</HI> GOD <HI>and to the Lamb.</HI> <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">REVELAT.

<P><PB N="18" REF="009329_0027_1030ED71D0706790" MS="y">THE a&s;toni&s;hing defection from the purity of the Go&s;pel fore|told in the Jewi&s;h and Chri&s;tian prophecies, was certainly ac|compli&s;hed in the Papal dominion. It would be too large and ab&s;tru&s;e an enquiry, to &s;hew the exact corre&s;pondence of the in&s;pired de&s;criptions with the grandeur and declen&s;ion of an|tichri&s;tian Rome. I will only &s;hew, by pointing at &s;ome illu&s;|trious periods of hi&s;tory, in how clear a manner Almighty GOD hath made the victories and conque&s;ts of favoured nations his in&s;truments of weakening the Papal tyranny; of freeing the world from ignorance, &s;uper&s;tition, and impo&s;ture; and of gra|dually re&s;toring a pure go&s;pel, the original doctrine of JESUS CHRIST. Popery hath for a thou&s;and years prevailed through|out the greate&s;t part of Europe. It was perhaps at its highth both of &s;uper&s;tition and authority, in the beginning of the Reformation; when all Europe trembled at the thunders of the vatican, and the Popes were both warlike and politic Princes. A great part of Germany; &mdash; and England, under a King impatient of controul, &mdash; adhered to and protected the reformation: and our happy nation hath been ever &s;ince the favoured in&s;trument of Providence, in delivering Man|kind from a Super&s;tition, which at once in&s;laves and blinds her votaries. To a&s;&s;ert the freedom of the human mind, and open a way for &s;till farther emancipating the nations from this grie|vous yoke; is probably, in the views of Providence, one great object of our late conque&s;ts and the pre&s;ent Peace. As the Chri&s;tian world is at pre&s;ent divided into two great Societies, Popery and Prote&s;tanti&s;m: it is certain that all the &s;ucce&s;&s;es of the war have terminated in favour of the latter again&s;t the
<PB N="19" REF="009329_0028_1030ED7857B49698">
former: in weakening the power and extent of Super&s;tition, in advancing the &s;acred intere&s;ts of Truth and Freedom.</P>
<P>MAY we not then conclude that the purpo&s;e of the Deity, in giving empire to the Engli&s;h nation, is to maintain and dif|fu&s;e among Mankind the ble&s;&s;ings of humanity, freedom, and religion? In adapting human means to effect his coun&s;els, may it not be probable; that our Nation is now rai&s;ed to this highth of greatne&s;s and dominion, to be the refuge and a&s;ylum of Truth and Liberty: by its influence and example to free the we&s;tern world from Error and Super&s;tition; and to fix on this exten&s;ive Continent, what will be its <HI>peculiar</HI> glory, the univer&s;al e&s;tabli&s;hment of Civil Freedom and true Religion?</P>
<P>CHRISTIANITY indeed di&s;claims all methods of extending it|&s;elf, but tho&s;e of Truth and Per&s;ua&s;ion: and it may be ob|jected, that it is not for the honour of Religion, that it &s;hould be promoted by arms and conque&s;t. To vindicate this argu|ment, it mu&s;t be a firm principle, that a war entered into expre&s;ly with the de&s;ign of forcing the con&s;ciences of men, and obliging them to adopt the religion of the conqueror, is the highe&s;t in|ju&s;tice and impiety. The di&s;tinction between the wars which promote Truth, and tho&s;e which render Super&s;tition and Im|po&s;ture triumphant, con&s;i&s;ts in this. The wars which in their event promote true Religion are merely <HI>political</HI>; but in the ex|tending of impo&s;ture and fal&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Religion by force of arms&mdash;as in

the ca&s;e of Mahomet, and the popi&s;h cru&s;ades&mdash;tho&s;e wars were expre&s;ly <HI>religious</HI>; undertaken to promote, not civil intere&s;ts, but fal&s;e opinions: which can never be obtruded on mankind otherwi&s;e than by violence and u&s;urped authority. Apply this di&s;tinction to the late War: the i&s;&s;ue of which in the pre&s;ent Peace hath been &s;o favourable to the cau&s;e of Truth. The War, now &s;o happily terminated, was in it&s;elf merely a political and commercial quarrel between rival nations. Religion was not the <HI>human</HI> object in the conque&s;ts that have promoted it: and it may be doubted whether as to military mea&s;ures, it has at all influenced the deliberations of the cabinet of any Prince in Europe. Yet the events of a War conducted only on political views, have been &s;o overruled by a propitious Providence, as to effect the great ends of GOD's moral government: the cor|rection of vice, by the calamities it hath brought upon the world; the pre&s;ervation and enlargement of Religion, by giving victory and dominion to the ju&s;t cau&s;e. The pa&s;t War hath cer|tainly awakened our mother-Country from that &s;lumber of Honour Courage and Probity, into which a profligate &s;y&s;tem of politics, and an overgrown commerce had gradually thrown her: thus it hath &s;erved to puni&s;h our enormities, and retrieve our expiring virtue. Here then we mu&s;t di&s;cern and adore that Providence, which draws from human affairs, effects and con&s;equences lea&s;t in the intention of its in&s;truments and agents: which from the political and commercial conte&s;ts of rival princes, accompli&s;hes every moral purpo&s;e of a divine admini&s;tration: checks and and cha&s;ti&s;es the crimes of mankind: gives victory and conque&s;t to
<PB N="21" REF="009329_0030_1030ED830E854CE8">
the ju&s;ter cau&s;e: and by War it&s;elf enlarges the empire of the PRINCE OF PEACE:</P>
<P>HOWEVER flattering may be our ideas of the national glory and greatne&s;s: the <HI>Felicity</HI> of our Country &s;o much tran&s;cends its <HI>Virtue,</HI> that we mu&s;t refer it to &s;ome other cau&s;e; and what &s;o probable, as that which is here a&s;&s;igned? that we are made the happy in&s;truments of accompli&s;hing the views and purpo&s;es of divine Providence, on account of the Freedom of our civil Government, the purity and excellence of our Religion? Civil, like intellectual Liberty is better felt than explained: we enjoy it in fact; and England and her Colonies, by being &s;o fair examples of both Civil and Religious Freedom, will natural|ly be a check to foreign de&s;poti&s;m; and we may hope, always a &s;afe retreat, a &s;acred a&s;ylum, from Tyranny and Per&s;ecution.</P>
<P>Thus to di&s;cern JESUS CHRIST to be the <HI>end,</HI> His GOSPEL the <HI>object</HI> of all human revolutions, affords a convincing argument (among innumerable others) both of a moral Providence and of the truth of Revealed Religion. So characteri&s;tic is that de&s;cription of its divine author: <HI>a crown was given unto him, and he went forth conquering and to conquer.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">REVELAT. VI. 2.</NOTE></P>
<P>IF this theory be admitted&mdash;can there be a nobler &s;ubject of pious gratitude and thank&s;giving? Empire, glory, commerce, are great objects to Kings and State&s;men: but in the coun&s;els

of GOD, they are only &s;econdary attentions, and &s;ub&s;ervient to his univer&s;al plan of moral government; to which the intere&s;ts of virtue and religion are of the fir&s;t importance, as being inti|mately connected with the happine&s;s of his intelligent Creatures.</P>
<P>EVERY political ble&s;&s;ing of Liberty and Empire, Peace and Security, &s;hould therefore lead us to fulfil the intentions of the Deity; and to concur with his admini&s;tration, by improving them, publicly, and every one of us, to the purpo&s;es of Religion. As we have rea&s;on to think, that the &s;ucce&s;&s;es of the War and be|nefits of the Peace are intended for the furtherance of Truth and Chri&s;tianity: let us rightly improve the ine&s;timable pri|vilege we our&s;elves enjoy, of a pure and uncorrupted Go&s;pel. <Q><HI>GOD</HI> hath not dealt &s;o with any Nation, neither have the heathen knowledge of his laws.</Q></P>
