<P>IN July la&s;t, the following letter was tran&s;mitted to the per&s;on to whom it is ad|dre&s;&s;ed, and a few weeks ago it was retur|ned under cover, without a &s;yllable in reply. As children that are crammed with confec|tionary, have no reli&s;h for plain and whole|&s;ome food; &s;o men in power, who are &s;el|dom addre&s;&s;ed but in the &s;weet tones of adu|lation, are apt to be di&s;gu&s;ted with the plain and &s;alutary language of truth.

<HEAD>EXPOSTULATORY LETTER TO GEORGE WASHINGTON.</HEAD>
<P>IT will generally be admitted, Sir, and perhaps with ju&s;tice, that the great family of mankind were never more benefited by the military abilities of any individual than by tho&s;e which you di&s;|played during the memorable Ameri|can conte&s;t. Your country was injured, your &s;ervices were called for, you im|mediately aro&s;e and after performing the mo&s;t con&s;picuous part in that blood|&s;tained tragedy, you again became a private citizen, and unambitiou&s;ly reti|red to your farm &mdash; I here was more of true greatne&s;s in this procedure, than the modern world, at lea&s;t, had ever beheld; and while public virtue is ve|nerated by your country-men, a con|duct &s;o exalted, will not be forgotten.&mdash;The effects which your revolution
<PB N="4" REF="032785_0004_0FF564D4E4A59398">
will have upon the world are incalcula|ble. By the flame which you have kindled, every oppre&s;&s;ed nation will be enabled to perceive its fetters; and when man once knows that he is en|&s;laved, the bu&s;ine&s;s of emancipation is half performed&mdash;France has already bur&s;t her &s;hackles, neighboring nations will in time prepare, and another half century may behold the pre&s;ent be&s;ot|ted Europe, without a Peer, without a Hierarchy, and without a De&s;pot. If men were enlightened, revolutions would be bloodle&s;s; but how are men to be enlightened, when it is the intere&s;t of governors to keep the governed in ignorance? "To enlighten men," &s;ays your old corre&s;pondent, Arthur Young "is to make them bad &s;ubjects." Hur|ricanes &s;pread deva&s;tation: yet hurri|canes are not only tran&s;ient, but gives &s;alubrity to the torrid regions, and are quickly followed by azure &s;kies, and calm &s;un&s;hine. Revolutions too, for a time, may produce turbulence; yet revolutions clear the political atmo&s;|phere and contribute greatly to the comfort and happine&s;s of the human

In your rides along the banks of your fa|vorite Potowmack, in your frequent ex|cur&s;ions through your own exten&s;ive grounds, how gratifying mu&s;t be your &s;en&s;ation on beholding the animated &s;cenery around you, and how plea&s;ura|ble mu&s;t be your feelings, on reflecting that your country is now an a&s;ylum for mankind; that her commerce, her agriculture, and her population are greater than at any former period, and that this pro&s;perity is the natural re|&s;ult of tho&s;e rights which you defend|ed again&s;t an abandoned cabinet, with all that ability which men, who un|&s;heath the &s;word in the cau&s;e of hu|man nature will, I tru&s;t, ever di&s;play.

Your friend Jefferson<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Be&s;ides tho&s;e of color, figure and hair, there are other phy|&s;ical di&s;tinctions, proving a difference of race. They have le&s;s hair on their face and body. They &s;ecrete le&s;s by the kidneys, and more by the glands of the &s;kin, which gives them a very &s;trong di&s;agreeable odor. This greater degree of tran&s;piration renders them more tolerent of heat, and le&s;s &s;o of cold, than the whites. Perhaps too a difference of &s;tructure in the pul|monary aparatus, which a late ingenious experimenteli&s;t<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Crawford, Stockdale, London.</NOTE> has di&s;covered to be the principal regulator of animal heat, may have di&s;abled them from extricating, in the act of in&s;piration, &s;o much of that fluid from the outer air, or obliged them in ex|piration, to part with more of it. They &s;eem to require le&s;s &s;leep. A black, after hard labor through the day, will be in|duced by the &s;lighte&s;t amu&s;ements to &s;it up till midnight, or later, tho' knowing he mu&s;t be out by the fir&s;t dawn of the morning. They are at lea&s;t as brave, and more adventure|&s;ome. But this perhaps may proceed from a want of fore|thought, which prevents their &s;eeing a danger till it be pre&s;ent. When pre&s;ent, they do not go through it with more coolne&s;s or &s;teadine&s;s than the whites. They are more ardent after their females; but love &s;eems with them to be more an eager de&s;ire, than a tender delicate mixture of &s;entiment and &s;en|&s;ation. Their griefs are tran&s;ient. Tho&s;e numberle&s;s af|flictions, which render it doubtful whether Heaven has given life to us in mercy or in wrath, are le&s;s felt, and &s;ooner for|gotten with them. In general, their exi&s;tence appears to par|ticipate more of &s;en&s;ation than reflection. To this mu&s;t be a&s;|cribed their di&s;po&s;ition to &s;leep, when ab&s;tracted from their diver|&s;ions, and unemployed in labor. An animal who&s;e body is at re&s;t, and who does not reflect, mu&s;t be di&s;po&s;ed to &s;leep of cour&s;e. Comparing them by their faculties of memory, rea&s;on and ima|gination it appears to me, that in memory they are equal to the whites; in rea&s;on much inferior, as I think one could &s;carcely be found capable of tracing and comprehending the inve&s;tigations of Eucl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d; and that in imagination they are dull, ta&s;tele&s;s, and anomalous.</P>

<P>But if your feelings be actually re|pugnant to &s;lavery, then are you more culpable than the callous hearted plan|ter, who laughs at what he calls the pi|tiful whining of the Abolitioni&s;ts, be|cau&s;e he believes &s;lavery to be ju&s;tifia|ble, while you per&s;evere in a &s;y&s;tem which your con&s;cience tells you to be wrong.

appear to me the mo&s;t reprehen&s;ible; for man never is &s;o truly odious as when he inflicts upon others that which he him&s;elf abominates. When the cup of &s;lavery was pre&s;ented to your coun|trymen, they rejected it with di&s;|dain, and appealed to the world in ju&s;tification of their conduct; yet, &s;uch is the incon&s;i&s;tency of man, that thou|&s;ands upon thou&s;ands of tho&s;e very people, with your&s;elf among&s;t the num|ber, are now &s;edulou&s;ly employed in holding the &s;elf-&s;ame bitter draught to the lips of their &s;able brethren.

their own &s;ufferings. When your country lay brui&s;ed by the iron hand of de&s;poti&s;m, and you were compelled to retreat through the Jer&s;eys with a handful of half naked followers; when the bayonet of the mercenary gli&s;tened at your back, and liberty &s;eemed about to expire, when your farms were laid wa&s;te, your towns reduced to a&s;hes, and your plains and woods were &s;trew|ed with the mangled bodies of your brave defenders; when the&s;e events were taking place, every brea&s;t could feel, and every tongue could execrate the &s;anguinary proceedings of Britain; yet what the Briti&s;h were at that period; you are in a great degree at this&mdash;you are boa&s;tful of your own rights&mdash;you are violators of the rights of others, and you are &s;timulated by an in&s;atiable ra|pacity, to a cruel and relentle&s;s op|pre&s;&s;ion. If the wrongs which you now inflict be not &s;o &s;evere as tho&s;e which were inflicted upon you, it is not becau&s;e you are le&s;s inhuman than the Briti&s;h, but becau&s;e the unhappy ob|jects of your tyranny have not the power of re&s;i&s;tance. In defending your

<P>No!

Har&s;h as this conclu&s;ion may appear, yet it is war|ranted by your pre&s;ent practice; for the man who can boa&s;t of his own rights, and yet holds two or three hun|dred of his fellow beings in &s;lavery, would not he&s;itate in ca&s;e of a revolt to employ the mo&s;t &s;anguinary means in his power, rather than forego that which the <HI>truly</HI> republican laws of his country are <HI>plea&s;ed</HI> to call his property.

<P>Should the&s;e &s;trictures be deemed &s;e|vere or unmerited on your part, how comes it that while in the northern and middle &s;tates, the exertions of the virtu|ous Quakers &amp; all other philanthropi&s;ts, have produced &s;uch regulations as mu&s;t

irremedibly renounced.</P>
