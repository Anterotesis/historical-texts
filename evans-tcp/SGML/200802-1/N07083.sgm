<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Chri&s;tian Reader,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><HI>IF the publication of the following &s;ermons is thought to need any apology, the de&s;ire of the bearers, whom the author is under obligations to gratify and plea&s;e, if it may be to their edification, and the u&s;efulne&s;s and &s;ea&s;onablene&s;s of the &s;ubjects, mu&s;t make it.</HI></P>
<P><HI>As to the fir&s;t, it was preached upon a glorious and ever to be remembered occa&s;ion; but indeed is not worthy to bring up the rere of &s;o many better di&s;cour&s;es publi&s;hed before it, that were delivered the &s;ame day. The &s;ubject mu&s;t be acknowledged to be important; and tho' not well managed, yet this mite ca&s;t into the trea&s;ury for a thank-offering to the Lord, for this wonderful work of his, will add &s;omething thereto; e&s;pecially if any are hereby pre|vailed on to obey as well as &s;acrifice.</HI></P>
<P><HI>As to the la&s;t, it can't be thought impertinent to ad|dre&s;s little children, if we con&s;ider, that much of a pa&s;tor's bu&s;ine&s;s is with the lambs of the flock. To lead and guide them a-right, requires tenderne&s;s and &s;kill. Great concern is to be had for childrens good, and much pains taken that they may be &s;ober, &s;erious and religious. The corruption of their nature, and the times, require it. The marvellous works of the Lord, both of</HI> Mercy, <HI>in the great things he hath done for us, whereof we are glad; and of</HI> Judgment, <HI>in that &s;o many of our cho&s;en young men have
<PB N="ii" REF="009019_0004_1030722B67D649B8">
been brought down to the &s;ides of the pit, by the &s;word of men, &amp; the de&s;troying angel, call aloud for it; and his word &s;peaks the &s;ame thing. They are the hopes of the flock. If religion does not revive with the pre&s;ent ri&s;ing genera|tion, what will the next be?</HI></P>
<P><HI>This familiar compo&s;ition was made, and delivered to &s;tir up in young and tender minds, con&s;ideration about the things of God, and an eternal world, in &s;uch a way and manner as might be both profitable and plea&s;ing. For to plea&s;e, is de&s;irable; to profit is more &s;o; but to be faith|ful, is mo&s;t of all.</HI></P>
<P>Finally, <HI>This little book cannot expect to gain ap|plau&s;e,&mdash;do good it may, by the ble&s;&s;ing of God; with this view it ventures abroad into the world, with &s;ome little alterations and additions. If tho&s;e that heard, or read the words of it, are any thing bettered by it, and will pray for the author, that he may obtain mercy from the Lord to be faithful, and have the plea&s;ure of being &s;ucce&s;sful, he &s;hall be &s;atisfied.</HI></P>

<BIBL>1 SAM. xv. 22.</BIBL>
<Q><HI>And</HI> Samuel <HI>&s;aid, Hath the Lord as great delight in burnt offerings and &s;acrifices, as in obeying the voice of the Lord? Behold, to obey is better than &s;acrifice; and to hearken, than the fat of rams.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THIS chapter gives the hi&s;tory of an important expedition undertaken by King <HI>Saul,</HI> with a great army of I&s;rael, and of the men of Ju|dah, at the command of God, by the mouth of <HI>Samuel</HI> his Prophet, again&s;t the Amala|kites; their &s;ucce&s;s,&mdash;their di&s;obedience to the expre&s;s command of God,&mdash;his re&s;entment, and the &s;ad effects thereof, to <HI>Saul,</HI> even his rejection from being King.</P>
<P><HI>Amalek</HI> was <HI>E&s;au'</HI>s grand&s;on; from him de&s;cended the Amalakites. They had no doubt heard how <HI>Jacob</HI> &s;up|planted <HI>E&s;au</HI> his brother, and got the birth-right; ble&s;&s;ing, and con&s;equently the land of Canaan. For this they owed the I&s;raelites a grudge from generation to generation. Ac|cordingly, when I&s;rael was in the wilderne&s;s, weak, unarm|ed, di&s;pirited with long &s;ervitude, and marching toward the
<PB N="2" REF="009019_0006_1030722ED56CF858">
land of Canaan, "They met them by the way, &s;mote the hindmo&s;t of them, even all the feeble behind them, when they were faint and weary, and they feared not God." <HI>Deut.</HI> 25. 18. <HI>Jo&s;hua</HI> is directed to chu&s;e out men and go, and fight with <HI>Amalek,</HI> and by means of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI>'s faith and prayer, and <HI>Jo&s;hua'</HI>s &s;word, <HI>Amalek</HI> and his people are di&s;comfited, and I&s;rael delivered. Whereupon God com|mands <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> to write this in a book, for a memorial, and rehear&s;e it in the ears of <HI>Jo&s;hua,</HI> for (&s;ays God) "I will utterly put out the remembrance of <HI>Amalek</HI> from under heaven," <HI>Exod.</HI> 17, 14.&mdash;not &s;peedily and ab&s;olutely, but comparatively. "For the Lord would have war with <HI>Ama|lek</HI> from generation to generation," v. 16. Yea, he charges the I&s;raelites when they &s;hould be in quiet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the land, which he would give them, then "Thou &s;halt blot out the remembrance of <HI>Amalek</HI> from under heaven, thou &s;halt not forget it". <HI>Deut.</HI> 25. 19. The &s;pecial rea&s;on of this &s;everity &s;eems to be given in forementioned <HI>Exod.</HI> 17. 16. which &s;ome tran&s;late thus, as being more agreable to the Hebrew words, becau&s;e the hand (i. e. hand of <HI>Amalek</HI>) is upon, or again&s;t the Lord, therefore the Lord will have war with <HI>Amalek</HI> &amp;c. i. e. his hand was &s;tretch|ed out again&s;t God him&s;elf, for &s;o God e&s;teems it, becau&s;e it was done again&s;t that people among whom he had placed his throne, his tabernacle and dwelling; according to his covenant which he had made with them and their fathers, and was now conducting to the land which he had promi&s;ed, them; all which the Amalekites were probably acquainted with, and was a great aggravation of their &s;in.</P>
<P>Now, how great a re&s;emblance is there between the ca&s;e of Gods people I&s;rael of old and their Amalekiti&s;h enemies, and the ca&s;e of his <HI>New-Engli&s;h</HI> I&s;rael, and their <HI>Indian</HI> and <HI>French</HI> adver&s;aries?</P>
<P>Tho' God gave not this land to our fore-fathers by pro|mi&s;e, yet it was upon mature con&s;ideration, humble prayers
<PB N="3" REF="009019_0007_10307233231A8E98">
to God, and for &s;everal weighty rea&s;ons, that the fir&s;t planters of <HI>New-England</HI> at <HI>Plymouth</HI> came over; one of which, as they expre&s;s it, was&mdash;<Q>From an inward zeal and great hope of laying &s;ome foundation, or making way for pro|pagating the kingdom of Chri&s;t to the remote ends of the earth; tho' they &s;hould be but &s;teping &s;tones to o|thers</Q> &amp;c.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. PRINCE'S <HI>New-England</HI> Chronol. p. 49.</NOTE> And it's ob&s;ervable, their de&s;ign was for &s;ome unknown Country further &s;outhward, about <HI>Hud&s;on's|River;</HI> but God in his providence guided them to <HI>Plymouth,</HI> where (as the &s;ame writer ob&s;erves) <Q>they then unknow|ingly, e&s;caped the much greater danger of falling among the multitudes of &s;avages, at that time filling the countries about <HI>Hud&s;on's-River,</HI> and are landed in a place of greater &s;afety; where a general pe&s;tilence had two or three years before, exceedingly thinn'd the natives, and prepared the way for this feeble company.</Q><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Chronol. p. 84.</NOTE> But al|though their &s;avage enemies were comparatively few, yet there were more than enough to di&s;tre&s;s them, and their po&s;terity ever &s;ince. That we may well &s;ay, as in <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 44. 1, 2, 3. "We have heard with our ears, O God, our fathers have told us, what work thou did&s;t in their days, in the times of old. How thou did&s;t drive out the heathen with thy hand, and planted&s;t them: how thou did&s;t afflict the people, and ca&s;t them out. For they got not the land in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion by their own &s;word, neither did their own arm &s;ave them: But thy right hand, and thine arm, and the light of thy countenance, becau&s;e thou had&s;t a favour to them." We may al&s;o adopt that language, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 129. 1. 2. "Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth, may I&s;rael now &s;ay&mdash;yet they have not prevailed again&s;t me. If it had not been the Lord, who was on our &s;ide, now may I&s;rael &s;ay,&mdash;when men ro&s;e up again&s;t us: then they had &s;wallowed us up quick, when their wrath was kindled again&s;t us".</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="009019_0008_1030723963EEC2D0">
Now, from the wonderful interpo&s;itions of God in his providence from time to time, in favour of our fore-fathers, their enemies might plainly &s;ee, that the Lord was on their &s;ide, fought for them, and intended this land for their po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion; which notwith&s;tanding, as I &s;uppo&s;e, was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with the con&s;ent, or by purcha&s;e, from the Indian nations, as they increa&s;ed and needed it; and yet it's likely, if not cer|tain, there has been inju&s;tice done them in this matter; which may be one cau&s;e of their having been made &s;uch pricks in our eyes, and &s;uch thorns in our &s;ides. And there was no need of the&s;e our enemies being rooted out, and de&s;troyed, if they would but have been true and faithful, and had not proved treacherous and per&s;idious, fighting again&s;t God, as well as men, as the Amalekites did.</P>
<P>And as to our French neighbours, they envy'd us this good land, which we were in the rightful po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of. They have taken crafty coun&s;el again&s;t this people of God, (to allude to that in <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 83.) "they con&s;ulted again&s;t his hidden ones, they have &s;aid, Come, and let us cut them off from being a nation, that the name of I&s;rael may be no more in remembrance. For they have con&s;ulted together with one con&s;ent, they are confederate again&s;t thee." The tabernacles of <HI>Edom,</HI> and the I&s;hmaelites, of <HI>Moab,</HI> and the Hagarens. <HI>Gebal</HI> and <HI>Ammon,</HI> and <HI>Amalek,</HI> the Phili&s;tines, with the inhabitants of <HI>Tyre. A&s;&s;ur</HI> al&s;o is joined with them, they have holpen the children of <HI>Lot.</HI>" Tho&s;e of every tribe and nation, people and language, from ea&s;t to we&s;t, from north to &s;outh have been in&s;tigated, &s;tired up, and called forth to help, to lie in wait by the way &s;ide, as an adder in the path that biteth the hor&s;es heels, &s;o that his rider may fall backward, to &s;mite the hindmo&s;t, to cut off the feeble and defencele&s;s, to carry into a doleful captivity the weak and helple&s;s: Yea, the young man, that glorieth in his &s;trength, and the mighty man, and the man of war, that is prepared to the battel, to butcher the innocent, and torture, without di&s;tinction of &s;ex or age, and even tho&s;e who&s;e
<PB N="5" REF="009019_0009_1030723F40FBADB0">
lives have been given them for a prey, in the &s;acred &amp; mo&s;t &s;olemn treaties and capitulations. Such are the cruelties of the &s;ubjects and allies of the <HI>Mo&s;t Chri&s;tian King.</HI></P>
<P>Our <HI>Jo&s;hua'</HI>s therefore, have often been called upon, to chu&s;e out men, to go and fight with them; our <HI>Mo&s;es'</HI>s, <HI>Aaron'</HI>s and <HI>Hur'</HI>s, to a&s;cend the mount, and lift their hearts with their hands, to God in the heavens, that they might prevail again&s;t them. And altho' we have had no command from God to blot out the remembrance of them from un|der heaven, yet we have had occa&s;ion to pray, that He would bring them to rea&s;on, or to ruine; who have roared in the mid&s;t of the congregations, ca&s;t fire into his &s;anctuary, have defiled by ca&s;ting down the dwelling place of his name to the ground; have &s;aid in their hearts, let us de&s;troy them toge|ther, and have burnt up the &s;ynagogues of God in the land.&mdash;But to return to the &s;tory of the ancient Ama|lekites.</P>
<P>In fulfilment of his threatning, God &s;ends <HI>Saul,</HI> with a great ho&s;t, &s;aying, "Go and &s;mite <HI>Amalek,</HI> and utterly de|&s;troy all that they have, and &s;pare them not, but &s;lay both man and woman, infant and &s;uckling, ox and &s;heep, camel and a&s;s." Context, v. 3. But <HI>Saul,</HI> from a fooli&s;h pity, or for fear of the people, or from coveteou&s;ne&s;s, &s;pares <HI>A|gag,</HI> the King; and the be&s;t of the &s;heep and oxen, and all that was good, and would not utterly de&s;troy them: v. 9. And yet repeatedly in&s;i&s;ts upon it, that he had obey'd the voice of the Lord. <HI>v.</HI> 13 and 20. which, tho' he knew was not true, endeavours to ju&s;tify him&s;elf.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> By laying the blame on the people. "<HI>They</HI> have brought them from the Amalekites;"&mdash;"<HI>The</HI> peo|ple &s;pared the be&s;t of the &s;heep &amp;c. <HI>v.</HI> 15.&mdash;A common fault among men, ever &s;ince <HI>Adam'</HI>s time to &s;hift off blame from them&s;elves, to others; as if that would excu&s;e them, for not doing what they might and ought to have done.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="009019_0010_103072434C461700">
<HI>Secondly,</HI> By hypocritically pretending a regard to the honour and &s;ervice of God. But the people took of the &s;poil, &s;heep and oxen; the chief of the things which &s;hould have been utterly de&s;troyed, to &s;acrifice unto the Lord thy God in <HI>Gilgal, v.</HI> 21. He acknowledges, they were de|voted to de&s;truction by God, but takes upon him to &s;ay, when, and in what way, even by &s;acrificing them, when he &s;hould come to <HI>Gilgal;</HI> which pretence of piety toward God, was only to cover his impiety and avarice.</P>
<P>Now the words of the Text, are <HI>Samuel'</HI>s an&s;wer to his fallacious rea&s;on, for di&s;obeying the command of God. "Hath the Lord as great delight in burnt offerings and &s;acrifices, as in obeying the voice of the Lord? Behold, to obey, is better than &s;acrifice, and to hearken, than the fat of rams."</P>
<P>For <HI>Saul'</HI>s conviction, <HI>Samuel</HI> propounds a que&s;tion, which admits of an ea&s;y an&s;wer, that <HI>Saul</HI> could not fail to give at the fir&s;t propo&s;al; yet, that his conviction might be more full and &s;trong, he an&s;wers it him&s;elf, with a "Behold"&mdash;intimating that it was worthy of his particular notice and ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>From the words we may ob&s;erve, <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> That God hath comparatively little regard to the external and ceremonial part of the &s;ervices performed in his wor&s;hip.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> It is obedience to the commands of God from the heart, yielded in the life, that is plea&s;ing to him.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> This he would have well taken notice of, and practiced upon.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> That God hath comparatively little regard to the external and ceremonial part of the &s;ervices performed in his wor&s;hip.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="009019_0011_10307245726D06F0">
The wor&s;hip &amp; &s;ervice of God may be di&s;tingui&s;hed into natural and in&s;tituted, moral and ceremonial. That which the light of nature teaches, is binding upon all; but that which is ceremonial and in&s;tituted, may be obligatory only on &s;ome per&s;ons, places &amp; ages. Much of the wor&s;hip and &s;ervice of God under the Law was ceremonial; which &s;tood only, in meats, and drinks, and diver&s;e wa&s;hings, and carnal ordinances, impo&s;ed on them, until the time of reformation." Great part of it, con&s;i&s;ted in the offerings and &s;acrifices that were brought to God's altar,&mdash;in the birds and bea&s;ts that were &s;lain and offered unto God, particularly the burnt of|ferings. There were wholly burnt upon the altar,&mdash;were an acknowledgment that the offerers de&s;erved death&mdash;to make atonement for their &s;ins,&mdash;to be offered with a free heart, and to obtain the favour of God. So there were &s;a|crifices of the &s;ame kind of creatures, &s;ome of which were propitiatory, to procure pardon, and were typical of Chri&s;t, and his &s;acrifice of him&s;elf; others, were gratulatory, to give thanks and prai&s;e to God, for mercies received. Of this kind were tho&s;e &s;poken of in the text.</P>
<P>Now, the&s;e were of little account with God, tho' he had commanded them, and the Jews were often condemned for them. Sometimes, becau&s;e they brought only their outward oblation, <HI>bea&s;ts;</HI> without the inward, their <HI>hearts;</HI> which were not engaged therein, tho' this was their mo&s;t rea&s;onable &s;er|vice; and &s;ometimes becau&s;e they u&s;ed them to hide their hypocri&s;y and wickedne&s;s. Hence God &s;ays, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 50. 8. "I will not reprove thee for thy &s;acrifices, or thy burnt offer|ings; they have been continually before me." So <HI>I&s;ai.</HI> 1. 13. "Bring no more vain oblations, incen&s;e is an abomination to me," &amp;c. So far was it from being a &s;weet &s;melling &s;a|vour to him, as they imagined, con&s;idering with what an evil heart, and in what an un&s;anctified manner, they brought it. God's heart was &s;o little upon the&s;e things, that we find him &s;aying, in <HI>Jer.</HI> 7. 22. "I &s;pake not unto your fathers, nor commanded them, in the
<PB N="8" REF="009019_0012_1030724727024848">
day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, conc<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">|ing burnt offerings or &s;acrifices." God did command them, and he does not deny it, but comparatively &s;peaking. He did not command them <HI>at all,</HI> in compari&s;on with other things, which were of &s;o much <HI>more</HI> weight and worth with him. Agreable to this, is that, <HI>Hos.</HI> 6. 6. "For I de|&s;ired mercy, and not &s;acrifice, and the knowledge of God, more than burnt offerings;" which &s;hews, what is intended by God's de&s;iring mercy, and <HI>not</HI> &s;acrifice, i. e. <HI>rather</HI> than &s;acrifice; for men in mi&s;ery, need mercy from their fellow|men, but God does not need &s;acrifice. So that God had little re&s;pect either to the offerings and &s;acrifices under the Law, or to the offerers, meerly on their own account; for, "They could not make him that did the &s;ervice, nor the comers thereunto perfect." <HI>Heb.</HI> 10. 1. And as little de|light has he in the external parts of wor&s;hip, and attendance on ordinances under the Go&s;pel. For "bodily exerci&s;e profiteth little," 1. <HI>Tim.</HI> 4. 8. i. e. fa&s;ting, praying, read|ing, &amp;c. wherein the body is exerci&s;ed, though it may be of <HI>&s;ome</HI> u&s;e, it's <HI>little</HI> in compare with godline&s;s, or the prac|tice of true piety.</P>
<P>How vain then is it, to make much account, of what God makes &s;o little. It's what God e&s;teems, and is delighted in, that will avail us any thing; and not what we &s;et an high value upon. Sometimes, "that which is highly e&s;teemed among&s;t men, is abomination in the &s;ight of God." <HI>Luke</HI> 16. 15. Hence he &s;aid to his people of old, <HI>I&s;ai.</HI> 1. 10, 14. "To what purpo&s;e is the multitude of your &s;acrifices to me? I delight not in the blood of bullocks&mdash;Incence is an abomination to me,&mdash;the new moons, and &s;abbaths, I can|not away with,&mdash;your appointed fea&s;ts, my &s;oul hateth &amp;c. The &s;acrifice [or prayer] of the wicked is an abomination to the Lord," <HI>Prov.</HI> 15. 8. It can't then be wi&s;e or &s;afe for per&s;ons to have any dependance upon the ceremonial, external parts of religion, to bring them into favour with God. Which leads us to the next ob&s;ervation, <HI>namely,</HI></P>

<HI>Secondly.</HI> That it is obedience to the commands of God from the heart, yielded in the life, that is plea&s;ing to him.</P>
<P>This is implied in <HI>Samuel</HI>'s que&s;tion, and expre&s;&s;ed in his an&s;wer. He has not &s;o great delight in burnt offerings and &s;acrifices, as in obeying the voice of the Lord. <HI>This,</HI> is better than &s;acrifice. <HI>That,</HI> is good, &s;o far as it goes, but <HI>this</HI> is better: "And to hearken, than the fat of rams." The fat was the be&s;t part of the &s;acrifice, and appropriated to God, to be burnt upon the altar. "All the fat is the Lord's, <HI>Lev.</HI> 3. 16. That is "all the fat that is upon, and cover|eth the inwards, the fat that is upon the two kidneys, and the caul above the liver," <HI>v.</HI> 14, 15. It is this kind of fat that was thus devoted. Neither he that brought the offer|ing, nor he that offered it, was to have any part of it. This &s;ignified, that we ought to give the choice&s;t and mo&s;t excel|lent of our &s;ervices to God; and that our inward parts, our &s;ouls and &s;pirits, are our be&s;t. The&s;e are the fat of go&s;pel &s;acrifices.</P>
<P>Now, "to hearken is better than the fat of rams." To <HI>hearken,</HI> &s;uppo&s;es attention of mind, &amp; engagedne&s;s of heart; and if thereupon, obedience to the voice of God in his com|mands is yielded, this is plea&s;ing to him; this is his delight, and better than the fat of fed bea&s;ts.</P>
<P>It's the heart God requires in all religious &s;ervices,&mdash;is what he looks at, and is well plea&s;ed with, in duties. His demand, is that, "My &s;on, give me thine heart." And when this is engaged in the performance of moral and evan|gelical duties, he is more delighted, than with all the Levitical ceremonies and &s;ervices. Hence that direction, <HI>Eccl.</HI> 5. 1. "Keep thy foot," (i. e. thy thoughts and affections) "when thou goe&s;t to the hou&s;e of God, and be more ready to hear, than to give the &s;acrifice of fools, for, they con&s;ider not that they do evil." It's not enough to hear, but it mu&s;t be in order to practice. "Ble&s;&s;ed are they that hear the word
<PB N="10" REF="009019_0014_1030724CA5987B30">
of God, and keep it," When God te&s;tified again&s;t his peo|ple for tru&s;ting in their offerings and &s;acrifices, in <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 50. He lets them know what would an&s;wer their end, <HI>v.</HI> 14, 15. "Offer unto God thank&s;giving and pay thy vows unto the mo&s;t High: And call upon me in the day of trouble; I will deliver thee, and thou &s;halt glorify me." So when he had complained of their vain oblations, which were of no &s;ervice to them, he puts them in a way to plea&s;e and pacify him, <HI>I&s;ai.</HI> 1. 16. "Wa&s;h ye, make you clean, put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes, cea&s;e to do evil, learn to do well,' &amp;c. Chri&s;t al&s;o &s;ays to the Phari&s;ees, <HI>Mat.</HI> 9. 13. "Go ye and learn what that mean|eth, I will have mercy and not &s;acrifice.' But he &s;ets this matter in a clear and &s;trong light, <HI>Mat.</HI> 23. 23. "Wo un|to you Scribes and Phari&s;ees, Hypocrites; for ye pay tithe of mint, &amp; anni&s;e, and cummin, and have omitted the weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy and faith: the&s;e ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone." God has &s;ome delight in ceremonial ob&s;er|vances, as they are of his in&s;tituting, but he has greater in obedience to moral duties and go&s;pel precepts. And <HI>Saul</HI>'s di&s;obedience to the command of God, could not be compen&s;ated with burnt-offerings and &s;acrifices; &s;o neither can the want of acts of piety toward God, and ju&s;tice and charity toward men, be atoned for by a profe&s;&s;ion of re|ligion, and attending his wor&s;hip and ordinances, tho' in a con&s;ciencious manner. The penitent P&s;almi&s;t &s;ays, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 51. 16, 17. "Thou delighte&s;t not in &s;acrifice, el&s;e would I give it: Thou delighte&s;t not in burnt-offerings. The &s;acrifices of God, are a broken &s;pirit: a broken and a con|trite heart, O God, thou wilt not de&s;pi&s;e." And when an obedient, holy life is con&s;equent thereupon, this is eminent|ly plea&s;ing to God.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> This he would have well taken notice of and practiced upon. <HI>Behold!</HI> to obey is better than &s;acri|fice &amp;c.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="009019_0015_1030724E820234B8">
Some times, this word is u&s;ed as a note of admiration, when any thing &s;trange and &s;urprizing is &s;poken of; as in <HI>I&s;ai.</HI> 7. 14. "Behold, a virgin &s;hall conceive, and bear a &s;on." Some times, as a note of attention, to quicken to con&s;ideration, and to think upon a thing with due regard; as in <HI>Rom.</HI> 11. 22. "Behold therefore, the goodne&s;s and &s;everity of God." And in this &s;en&s;e, <HI>Samuel</HI> u&s;es it here. "Behold, to obey," &amp;c. <HI>q. d.</HI> take notice of it, con&s;ider it well, impre&s;s it upon thy heart and mind, know thou it for thy good, <HI>Saul,</HI> that the way to plea&s;e God, is to obey his commands, and not di&s;regard them under a pretence of pro|viding more plentifully for &s;acrificing on his altar. To obey his voice, is better than to offer thou&s;ands of bullocks, and rams, and lambs out of the fold and &s;tall.</P>
<P>Now, this is a truth God would have <HI>us</HI> ob&s;erve, and practice accordingly; even this, that we regard not our own imaginations, inventions, nor indeed his in&s;titutions, when we are about to attend on them out of &s;ea&s;on, or when he calls us to other duties, that are more important and nece&s;|&s;ary; or when we lay more weight upon them, than he al|lows us; or would &s;hew our regard to him in a way which he does not &s;o much require, and is not &s;o much for his honour and glory, as another; which he at this <HI>Time</HI> particu|larly, and on this <HI>great Occa&s;ion</HI> calls us unto; Namely, to hearken to his voice, obey his commands, and not formally, and hypocritically offer prai&s;e to him, with our mouths &s;hewing much love, when our hearts are far from him, and our lives and conver&s;ation contrary to his plainly revealed mind and will.</P>
<P>Thus much briefly for the doctrinal part of the words.</P>
<P>I come now to make &s;ome Improvement of them &s;uita|ble to the pre&s;ent day.</P>
<P>The Great God, who rules in the world, and governs among the nations, in his Providence; and our Gracious
<PB N="12" REF="009019_0016_103072524FEAA948">
Sovereign, by his Commands, has called forth his armies, to go and &s;mite our wor&s;e than Amalekiti&s;h enemies, for what they have done, and contrived again&s;t us; not indeed utterly to de&s;troy all that they have, and not &s;pare them, &s;laying man and woman, infant and &s;uckling, as they too much endeavoured to do by us: but to bring them to rea|&s;onable and righteous terms of peace, that we might live quietly and &s;afely in the land that God has given us for a po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. We &s;ought the Lord in the day of our di&s;tre&s;s, by prayer, fa&s;ting and humbling our &s;ouls before him; and we tru&s;t he has regarded us in our low e&s;tate: For thro' the good hand of our God upon our forces, and a wonder|ful &s;eries of favourable providences, they have &s;mitten and reduced them from <HI>Cape-Breton</HI> to <HI>Quebec,</HI> and from <HI>Mont-Real,</HI> until thou come&s;t to <HI>Ohio,</HI> over again&s;t <HI>Loui&s;iana,</HI> and the great river <HI>Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi,</HI> even their whole country of <HI>Canada,</HI> from one end thereof unto the other; and brought it under the dominion of the King of <HI>Great-Britain;</HI> but on the &s;poil laid they not their hand; nor &s;aid, as did <HI>Edoms</HI> &s;ons, "ra&s;e it, ra&s;e it, even to the foundation there|of;" neither have they "rewarded them as they &s;erved us, taking and da&s;hing their little ones again&s;t the &s;tones." But they have taken <HI>Vandreuil,</HI> their Governor; who by all account, de&s;erves to be "hewed in pieces before the Lord; and his mother to be made childle&s;s among women; as his &s;word has made many women childle&s;s."</P>
<P>Our armies having been thus &s;ucce&s;sful, through the mercy of the Lord, we are this day called upon to take the high prai&s;es of God into our mouths; while a two-edged &s;word is in our hands.</P>
<P>I &s;uppo&s;e, neither we, nor our Fathers, ever had &s;uch rea|&s;on to keep a day of thank&s;giving, and which is &s;o like the <HI>Jews</HI> days of <HI>Purim,</HI> wherein they re&s;ted from their ene|mies; which were turned unto them, from &s;orrow to joy, and from mourning into a good day, which they made days
<PB N="13" REF="009019_0017_10307257CACFCAB0">
of fea&s;ting and joy, and of &s;ending portions one to another, and gifts to the poor." <HI>E&s;th.</HI> 9. 22. Who among the mo&s;t &s;anguine, in their hopes, could a few years ago, have ex|pected to &s;ee &s;uch a day as this? Who is not &s;urprized at it, when he con&s;iders our de&s;erts?&mdash;How unfit and un|prepared we are to receive, and how unworthy of &s;uch a mercy! and who &s;hould not tremble for fear of the con&s;e|quences. Indeed, "we are like unto them that dream."</P>
<P>Now, what &s;hall we render unto the Lord for the&s;e be|nefits? Will it &s;uffice, that we te&s;tify our joy and thank|fulne&s;s by outward expre&s;&s;ions of it (though the&s;e in a manner and mea&s;ure are proper) by ringing bells, making bon-fires, illuminations, firing &s;mall arms and cannon, eating the fat, and drinking the &s;weet, not to &s;ay, to exce&s;s? Will the Lord be plea&s;ed with this? Or &s;hall it be thought enough, that we offer a few burnt-offerings and &s;acrifices, and the fat of rams?&mdash;that we &s;et apart a day for thank&s;|giving,&mdash;come up to God's hou&s;e,&mdash;are at the expence of a little lip-labour, or bodily exerci&s;e; in &s;inging his prai&s;es, &s;peaking to the honour of his name &amp;c.? Shall this be thought a &s;uitable return for his marvellous loving-kindne&s;s, in thus pre&s;erving and &s;ecuring to us our habitati|ons, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, properties, lives and liberties, civil and religious? No, verily. To hearken to the voice of the Lord, and to obey his commandments, which is better than all the&s;e performances, is the lea&s;t we can render to him; and if we don't, we &s;hall be guilty of rebellion, which is as the &s;in of witch-craft, and &s;tubbornne&s;s, which is as ini|quity and idolatry."</P>
<P>Well then, let us &s;ee that we do &s;omething that is in &s;ome degree an&s;werable to the expectations of God from us, under the great things he has done for us.</P>
<P>And here,</P>
<P N="1">1. Let us &s;ee to get &s;ome &s;en&s;e of our utter unworthi|ne&s;s of &s;uch wonderful deliverances from our enemies, and &s;uch victories obtained over them.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="009019_0018_1030725B240826D0">
O what a &s;inful back&s;liding people are we? As we have increa&s;ed, &s;o we have &s;inned. All the methods of God's providence and grace, have had an hardening, in&s;tead of &s;oftning effect upon us. He hath been proving and try|ing us with judgments and mercies; but how little of our dro&s;s is purged away, and what ba&s;e mettal do we come forth? Reprobate &s;ilver, which the Lord might have ju&s;t|ly rejected, in&s;tead of ble&s;&s;ing and pro&s;pering us, as at this day.</P>
<P N="2">2. We &s;hould repent of our pa&s;t ingratitude and wick|edne&s;s.</P>
<P>Is not that our character, <HI>Rom.</HI> 1. 21.?&mdash;"Neither were thankful.' Are we not an unbelieving, di&s;obedient people, that have grieved the Holy Spirit, de&s;pi&s;ed Chri&s;t, and his glorious go&s;pel, and abu&s;ed the goodne&s;s of God? What need then of repentance! We might well repent of what we have done all our lives long, again&s;t &s;o com|pa&s;&s;ionate a Saviour, and &s;o good and gracious a God, who hath not remembred our &s;ins again&s;t us, nor dealt with us according to the de&s;erving of our hands. His goodne&s;s &s;hould lead every one of us, to unfeigned &s;orrow and re|pentance. If we had any ingenuity, any &s;en&s;e of &s;hame, any &s;park of gratitude, our repentings would be kindled together, our hearts would be turned in us unto the Lord, from whom we have departed, with whom we have dealt treacherou&s;ly, and in who&s;e covenant we have been un|faithful.</P>
<P N="3">3. Let us look to our hearts, that they now be right with God.</P>
<P>O what need is there to begin with them, and &s;ee that they are changed and &s;anctified! Until that is done, how can the holy God accept an offering at our hands? The &s;acrifice (whether of prayer or prai&s;e) of the wick|ed, is abomination; how much more, when he bringeth it with a wicked mind? <HI>Prov.</HI> 21. 27. Let us &s;ee to get

our hearts circumci&s;ed to love God; and keep them en|gaged in his &s;ervice; not &s;uffering them to go after vani|ties and lies; things that will not profit in the day of trouble and death.</P>
<P N="4">4. Let us take heed to our ways and doings, that they may be good.</P>
<P>That they have not been good, is too evident. The&s;e works of the Lord, and operations of his hands, call for a reformation; and wo will be unto us, if it is not effect|ed. Let us then break off from our &s;ins, by repentance, and from our iniquities, by turning to the Lord. And O that the time pa&s;t of our lives might &s;uffice, wherein we have &s;erved diver&s;e lu&s;ts and corruptions; and let us now re&s;olve, that as for us and our hou&s;es, we will &s;erve the Lord. If not, "and after all that is come upon us for our evil deeds, and our great tre&s;pa&s;&s;es, &s;eeing that our God hath puni&s;hed us le&s;s than our iniquities de&s;erve, and hath given us &s;uch deliverance as this; &s;hould we again break his commandments, and join in affinity with the people of the&s;e abominations, would he not be angry with us, till he hath con&s;umed us, &s;o that there &s;hould be no remnant nor e&s;caping."</P>
<P>In a word and to conclude,</P>
<P>What obligations are we under, to be an holy, thankful and obedient people our &s;elves, and to de&s;ire that the conque&s;ts that have been made, may advance the King|dom of the Great Redeemer in this part of the world; and be a means to make ready a people prepared for the Lord; that his name may be one throughout all the earth!</P>

<HEAD>A Plain and brief Di&s;cour&s;e TO Little CHILDREN.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>1 JOH. ii. 1.</BIBL>
<Q><HI>My little Children, the&s;e things write I unto you, that ye &s;in not.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THIS epi&s;tle was wrote by the &s;ame <HI>John,</HI> who is &s;ometimes called the beloved di&s;|ciple,&mdash;that wrote the go&s;pel that bears his name,&mdash;the book of Revelations, and two other epi&s;tles that follow this. He lived the longe&s;t of all the apo&s;tles, and was probably an old man now. Tho&s;e to whom he wrote this epi&s;tle, are thought to be Jews, &s;cattered in a coun|try di&s;tant from where he was; &s;o that he could not come to &s;peak to them, and therefore from love to his own people and kindred, he writes this letter to them: For he was the apo&s;tle and mini&s;ter of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and had a concern for their good. And no doubt, they were glad to receive and hear it, and attended carefully to what was in it.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="009019_0021_10307264DCB60578">
In this chapter, we find, he writes to &s;everal &s;orts and ages of per&s;ons; as to fathers, to young men, and in the text to little children.</P>
<P>"My little children, the&s;e things write I unto you." One upon the place ob&s;erves, <Q>He be&s;peaks them with a compellation, importing both authority and love; well becoming him, as then an aged per&s;on, and apo&s;tle, their teacher, and who was their mo&s;t af|fectionate &s;piritual father.</Q></P>
<P>What he writes to them about, is, not their tempo|ral, but &s;piritual affairs; not concerning the welfare of their bodies, but the &s;afety of their &s;ouls.&mdash;"That ye &s;in not." For &s;in is to the hurt and de&s;truction of &s;oul and body both; in time, and to eternity. So that the apo&s;tle might well write to them, <HI>not to &s;in.</HI> But he writes to them al&s;o about other things, as of Je&s;us Chri&s;t's being their advocate with the Father;&mdash;their knowing him;&mdash;keeping his commandments;&mdash;walking as he walked;&mdash;loving their brother, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Now, as the apo&s;tle <HI>wrote</HI> unto his little children, &s;o my little children of this Congregation, I would <HI>&s;peak</HI> unto you.&mdash;To you that are fifteen years old and un|der, who are capable of hearing, receiving, under&s;tand|ing and practicing, what may be &s;aid to you from the word of the Lord; even, all of you, both male and fe|male, in what place, or part &s;oever of the meeting hou&s;e, you &s;it. I &s;ay, to you particularly, I &s;hall direct my &s;peech at this time; but not exclu&s;ive of others. To you, O children, I call; and my voice is to every one of you; as if I called you by name.</P>
<P>Through the patience of a &s;overeign God, I have op|portunity and ability to &s;peak to you, and you are alive, and have liberty to hear me. O that you might &s;o in|cline
<PB N="3" REF="009019_0022_10307267C6752708">
your ears and hear, what may be &s;poken, agreeable to the word and will of God, as that your &s;ouls may live!</P>
<P>I have with much weakne&s;s and fear, been preaching to your grand-parents, and parents, above thirty years. Some number of the latter, I baptized, catechi&s;ed and in|&s;tructed, when they were young, as you are; and it would be a great comfort to me now, and a great advantage to them, if I had done it more faithfully, and they had lived more fruitfully.</P>
<P>But as I &s;aid, I am now &s;peaking to you, my little Children.</P>
<P>If you a&s;k me, why I &s;peak to you about your &s;ouls, and &s;erious things, now you are &s;o young, and well, like to live &s;o many years, and have &s;o little inclination, thought and time, to &s;pare for &s;uch things?</P>
<P>I an&s;wer; I will give you diver&s;e rea&s;ons; and if you will but attend to them, the younge&s;t of you may &s;ee, that they are good and weighty.</P>
<P>And here,</P>
<P N="1">1. The fir&s;t rea&s;on is, You have immortal &s;ouls to be &s;aved or damned, as well as older per&s;ons.</P>
<P>Children do not die as the bea&s;ts do, who&s;e &s;pirits go downward to the earth; and for ought that I know, die with their bodies; but Children have immortal &s;pirits that go upward, to God that gave them; to be &s;ent to heaven or hell, according as they have been good or wicked. <HI>Abijah,</HI> the good &s;on of <HI>Jeroboam,</HI> went to hea|ven when he died, becau&s;e in him, there was found &s;ome good thing toward the Lord God of I&s;rael. But tho&s;e forty-two Children that the She-bears tare in pieces, mo&s;t
<PB N="4" REF="009019_0023_1030726981C36A80">
likely, went to hell; for they mocked an old man, and a prophet of the Lord, out of contempt of God, and religion, and he cur&s;ed them in the name of the Lord; not from &s;inful pa&s;&s;ion, but by the direction of the Spirit of God;&mdash;which is a warning to all Children, again&s;t any &s;uch conduct. Now, to one of tho&s;e two places, your &s;ouls will be carried when you die. Is it not then need|ful you &s;hould be &s;poke to about &s;oul concernments; one of which Chri&s;t has taught us to think, is of more worth than the world?</P>
<P N="2">2. Now, while you are living, you have time and opportunity to &s;eek their &s;alvation.</P>
<P>It is in vain to &s;peak to the dead. They are pa&s;t heating, and receiving in&s;truction. They are gone into eternity, where no offers of &s;alvation are made to &s;inners; for it's in time, while they are in this world, that they are to mind the things of their everla&s;ting peace. But you are alive, in the world, and may be &s;poke to, with hope that it may be for your &s;oul's good. And it is a great mercy to have time, to prepare for eternity in, though you &s;pend &s;o much of it in &s;in and vanity;&mdash;and opportunity, to pray, read, hear the word, and to be in&s;tructed in your duty, and the way to e&s;cape the wrath and cur&s;e of God. And don't you never think of it, that as young as you are, you mu&s;t be called to an ac|count by God, how you have profited by the&s;e opportu|nities? If you don't, it will be &s;o. For do you not re|member, that this &s;ame <HI>John,</HI> in a vi&s;ion in the Revela|tions, &s;aw the dead, &s;mall and great, &s;tand before God, and were judged according to their works? O, it is then fit, now to &s;peak to you, and for you to hear, that &s;o you may give up your account with joy, and not with grief.</P>
<P N="3">3. Now you are not hardened in a way and cour&s;e of &s;in, as you may be &s;ome years hence, when there will be le&s;s encouragement to &s;peak to you.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="009019_0024_10307270806201D8">
You are not got into the way of lying, or profane &s;peaking, of going to taverns, or into evil company, which dreadfully harden the heart, &s;tupify the con&s;|cience, and make it difficult to reform &s;uch per&s;ons. You know it is harder to bend a tree, than a young plant. We read of young <HI>Jo&s;iah,</HI> that his heart was tender; that he humbled him&s;elf before the Lord; wept before him, and rent his cloaths. But old hard|ened <HI>Pharaoh</HI> &s;aid, Who is the Lord, that I &s;hould obey his voice? And ten dreadful plagues, made but little impre&s;|&s;ion on him. And when you grow up, and grow old, if God &s;hould leave you to your&s;elves, you would be as bad as <HI>Pharaoh.</HI> But now, you are more afraid of &s;in, and may be more ea&s;ily brought to be &s;orry for it: And by being &s;poken to &s;ea&s;onably, it's hope|ful, you may be kept from evil ways, that lead to death and de&s;truction.</P>
<P N="4">4. Now God is calling upon you by his providences, and therefore I would &s;peak unto you at this time.</P>
<P>There is a voice in the providences of God. There|fore we read, "The Lord's voice crieth unto the city, hear ye the rod, and who hath appointed it." And &s;ometimes the Lord's voice is loud and terrible in this way; and they are &s;tupid, &s;en&s;ele&s;s creatures, that don't hear and regard it. Now God is calling to you, Chil|dren, in the late deaths of a number of &s;uch as were about your age. Six weeks ago, a little girl,<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Huldah Witherbe,</HI> who died <HI>Sept.</HI> 13.</NOTE> about ten years old, was taken away from among you, by death.

By all which in&s;tances, God is calling upon <HI>you,</HI> Children, to get ready for death and the grave.</P>
<P>And though ordinarily, it is not good manners to &s;peak, when another, e&s;pecially a &s;uperior, is &s;peak|ing; yet, it's decent and duty, for God's mini&s;ters to &s;econd his call in his providences, with that of his word, that if you will not hear the one, you may hear the other. For a <HI>word</HI> at one time, will do a Child more good, than a <HI>blow</HI> at another. And &s;ome Children have &s;o much ingenuity, that they will regard a word of in&s;truction, more than others will the rod of correction. I hope, there are &s;ome of you, my little Children, that are of this ingenuous temper. Is there ne'er a little boy, or little girl here, that will mind, and remember what I am &s;aying? If I was telling a good, merry &s;tory, you would hearken to it, with both ears; and why &s;hould you not, now I am puting you in mind, how many of your age have lately been nailed up in a <HI>dark coffin,</HI> and are gone into an amazing eternity, where you will &s;oon follow them?</P>
<P N="5">5. Now, you have the greate&s;t encouragement you ever will have, to hear for your lives; and therefore I &s;peak to you.</P>
<P>Chri&s;t, gives particular direction to his mini&s;ters, to feed his lambs. He took little Children into his arms, when here on earth, and ble&s;&s;ed them; &s;aying, "Suffer little Children, and forbid them not, to come unto me, for of &s;uch is the kingdom of Heaven." And, "Except ye be converted, and become as little Chil|dren, ye &s;hall not enter into the kingdom of Hea|ven."</P>

So, there are great <HI>Promi&s;es</HI> made to &s;uch as you are, to encourage you, to be religious betimes, "Seek ye fir&s;t the kingdom of God, and his righteou&s;ne&s;s, and all the&s;e things, &s;hall be added unto you." "I love them, (&s;ays Wi&s;dom) that love me, and tho&s;e that &s;eek me early &s;hall find me." And are not <HI>the&s;e</HI> en|couragements enough to you? They encourage me to <HI>&s;peak,</HI> and why &s;hould they not you to <HI>hear.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. You have many examples to induce you.</P>
<P>When <HI>Jo&s;iah</HI> king of Judah, was but &s;ixteen years old, he began to &s;eek after the God of <HI>David</HI> his father. And <HI>Edward</HI> the VI. king of <HI>England,</HI> died when he was &s;ixteen years of age, and yet, was an eminently pious prince. So there was young <HI>Oba|diah,</HI> and <HI>Timothy,</HI> and others on &s;cripture record. There have been many al&s;o in the&s;e days, that have been &s;erious and religious in their childhood and youth.</P>
<P>I remember, a few years ago, in the time of the great mortality, in this, and &s;ome of the neighbouring towns,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the beginning of the year 1754; when &s;ixteen per&s;ons, old and young, died in this town in le&s;s than &s;even weeks.</NOTE> a Lad came to me, with that important enquiry, <HI>What he &s;hould do to be &s;aved?</HI> But it may be, he has too much forgot it now. And I heard a young man &s;ay, t'other day, that when he was twelve years old, he joined to the Church. But, <HI>my little, Children,</HI> I am afraid there are few of you that have any <HI>thoughts</HI> about <HI>that.</HI> And yet, is it not your duty as well as his? And are not you obliged to walk in all the com|mandments and ordinances of the Lord blamele&s;s? Who gave you, or indeed your fathers and mothers, liberty
<PB N="8" REF="009019_0027_103072792332D570">
to di&s;obey that command of Chri&s;t, "Do this in re|membrance of me?" If you &s;ay, you are not &s;eri|ous and &s;ober enough; Who&s;e fault is that? Or, if you &s;ay, it is not the cu&s;tom, as it is to own the Cove|nant; and you &s;hall have no company. You are right in <HI>that;</HI> and the way you are in, you have company enough: But will that be any comfort to you, when you, with the fearful, and unbelieving, and di&s;obedi|ent, and abominable, &s;hall have your part in the lake which burns with fire and brim&s;tone, which is the &s;e|cond death? Surely, No! Will you follow a multi|tude to do evil? Will you go to hell for company's &s;ake? Would you creep into a flaming oven? Or dance upon the mouth of a burning pit, becau&s;e your companions would do &s;o? No, their &s;hrieks would keep you back. But to follow them, impenitently, in their evil cour&s;es, is ten thou&s;and times more dreadful, tho' you don't &s;ee it or believe it. What a pity is it, &s;o many pretty Children, as are now in this A&s;&s;embly, &s;hould follow evil examples, to their eternal ruine, when there are examples for them to follow, which would lead them to everla&s;ting ble&s;&s;edne&s;s!</P>
<P N="7">7. The mo&s;t that are converted, and &s;hall be &s;aved, began to be &s;erious when young.</P>
<P>A&s;k them, and they will tell you &s;o. Few grow <HI>good,</HI> when they are grown <HI>old.</HI> Many, many can tell you, they know from their own &s;ad and &s;orrowful experience, that it <HI>is</HI> &s;o; and that they wi&s;h now they had begun to &s;eek God in earne&s;t, when they were of your age. For as elderly men and women, <HI>never</HI> en|ter into their mothers wombs, and are <HI>naturally</HI> born again, &s;o they <HI>&s;eldom</HI> are <HI>&s;piritually</HI> born, or experi|ence the new-birth, by the &s;pecial operations of the Spirit of God. Such in&s;tances are very rare. Many are converted, when under twenty, but few when they are above forty years of age,</P>

Once more,</P>
<P N="8">8. You don't know that you &s;hall live to be men and women, and what will become of you, if you &s;hould die while you are little Children?</P>
<P>There is not one of you, that <HI>know</HI> you &s;hall live to <HI>grow</HI> old, or have longer opportunity to prepare for death, than tho&s;e Children, that have lately been laid in their graves; and if you <HI>did,</HI> do you know that the Spirit of God will &s;trive with you <HI>then,</HI> convince, convert and &s;ave you, when-as you will not cry to him daily, <HI>now,</HI> and live &s;oberly and religiou&s;ly? No, you would have no rea&s;on to expect it.</P>
<P>Well, for the&s;e, among other rea&s;ons, I thought to &s;peak to you, <HI>my little Children.</HI> And don't you think they are good rea&s;ons, and &s;ufficient; and that you need to be &s;poken to, though you are young and thought|le&s;s, and &s;et away yonder, behind others, that are older, that know more than you do, that might do bet|ter, and ought to live otherwi&s;e than they do.</P>
<P>Now then, <HI>you</HI> are to be &s;poken unto; a Sermon is made on purpo&s;e for you; and &s;hould you not attend to it with diligence? Therefore, as Wi&s;dom &s;ays "Hear|ken unto me, now therefore, O ye Children, and at|tend to the words of my mouth." And as <HI>David</HI> &s;peaks, "Come ye Children, hearken unto me, I will teach you the fear of the Lord."</P>
<P>Now, what I &s;hall &s;peak to you about, is <HI>Sin,</HI> and then &s;omething of the <HI>Saviour</HI> therefrom.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t, About Sin.</HI> The A&s;&s;embly's Chatechi&s;in, a|greably to the &s;criptures, tells you, That "Sin is any want of conformity unto, or tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of the law of God." It came into the world of men, at <HI>Alam'</HI>s

<HI>fall.</HI> You have <HI>original &s;in</HI> in you;&mdash;are under guilt, becau&s;e of it;&mdash;are defiled with it, as you de&s;cend from him, and are naturally inclined to &s;in. A clean thing, cannot come out of an unclean. A corrupt fountain will &s;end forth impure &s;treams. The holie&s;t and be&s;t men find it in them&s;elves, and therefore it mu&s;t be in you; for they and you de&s;cended from the &s;ame fir&s;t parents. Becau&s;e &s;ome don't &s;ee it in <HI>them|&s;elves,</HI> or believe it is in <HI>all,</HI> it does not follow that it is not. Negative evidence will not do, in this ca&s;e. If you feel it, and know it to be in your&s;elves, you will believe it, if twenty men tell you it is not. Hence it is, that you are &s;o inclined to evil, going a&s;tray as &s;oon as you are born, &s;peaking lies, &s;erving divers Ju&s;ts and corruptions. Now you mu&s;t &s;ee this, and lament it, if you would ever come to any &s;aving good; &s;o far as I can under&s;tand the &s;cripture.</P>
<P>So you are <HI>actual &s;inners;</HI> have &s;inned in thoughts, words and actions. O how many vain thoughts lodge within you. How many idle, &s;inful words have you &s;poken! And how many wicked things have you done again&s;t God, your parents, your neighbours and your &s;elves? Indeed the young man in the go&s;pel thought he had kept all the commands Chri&s;t mentioned to him, from his youth up, becau&s;e he did not know him&s;elf, and the bredth and &s;pirituality of the law of God; when-as he had broken them all, and kept none of them right, becau&s;e he had not done it out of love to God, and Chri&s;t. And you mu&s;t know it is &s;o with you, if you don't love the Lord with all your heart, &s;oul and &s;trength. And we read, that "Who|&s;oever &s;hall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all."</P>
<P>You mu&s;t al&s;o &s;ee what an evil and bitter thing it is, that you have &s;inned,&mdash;what wrath and cur&s;e from God you de&s;erve,&mdash;what mi&s;ery and angui&s;h
<PB N="11" REF="009019_0030_10307282D70E0210">
you are expo&s;ed to here, and for ever. <HI>This,</HI> is what you mu&s;t be deeply &s;en&s;ible of, and di&s;tre&s;&s;ingly concerned about.</P>
<P>Further, you mu&s;t be convinced, that you cannot make amends for your &s;ins, or pacify the anger of God, but mu&s;t be everla&s;tingly mi&s;erable, for all you can do; and mu&s;t expect no other, unle&s;s God has mercy on you, and freely pardons you. But how little have you <HI>known,</HI> and how little <HI>concern</HI> have you <HI>had</HI> about the&s;e things? Does not your thoughtle&s;ne&s;s and incon&s;ideratene&s;s, convince you, that &s;o it is with you? And can it be &s;afe, or how can you be ea&s;y, to live &s;o, in your &s;ins, and in danger every moment of dropping into hell? But then,</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> You mu&s;t know, that there <HI>is,</HI> and be &s;poken to <HI>about,</HI> a Saviour, even Je&s;us Chri&s;t the Son of God, who &s;aves his people from their &s;ins.</P>
<P>He can help you, deliver you from &s;in, and the wrath to come; and make you holy and happy. He was born of a woman, yielded perfect obedience to the whole law, fulfilled all righteou&s;ne&s;s, &s;uffered and died, that you might be &s;aved. But then, you mu&s;t be intere&s;ted in his ju&s;tifying righteou&s;ne&s;s; be qualified for his pre&s;ence, and the enjoyment of him. And this mu&s;t be by experiencing a &s;pecial work of the Holy Gho&s;t, in your &s;ouls. You mu&s;t be re|generated, converted, and &s;anctified,&mdash;be made to be|lieve on him, to repent of all your &s;ins; abhor your &s;elves, love God and Chri&s;t, his commands, his people, his day, and all that whereby he makes him&s;elf and his will known unto you. Then you will be new crea|tures, quite other Children than now you are; the Children of God; and not of the devil; will be fit to <HI>live,</HI> and an&s;wer the end of living; living in obe|dience to his will, and to his glory; then al&s;o, you will be fit to <HI>die,</HI> let death come when it will.</P>

Thus, my little Children; I have &s;poken a few things unto you, very briefly. Now, will you, "Set your hearts unto all the words which I te&s;tify among you this day?" Will you try to remember them, and live according to them? There is <HI>that</HI> little Boy, and <HI>this</HI> little Girl; will not you mind them for your good, if no body el&s;e will? If you will not mind them <HI>now,</HI> they will come into your mind often enough in the other world. <HI>Now,</HI> you complain of your me|mories, that you can't remember what is &s;aid to you; but <HI>then,</HI> your memories will be &s;trong and tenacious. Probably, you will then be able to recollect and call to mind, all the coun&s;els, cautions and warnings that were ever given you, and your fooli&s;h and ob&s;tinate refu&s;al thereof;&mdash;all the &s;ermons you have heard;&mdash;all your neglected opportunities, &amp; abu&s;ed mercies, which you have now forgotten; Yea, every &s;inful action you have done, and idle word you have &s;poken, and evil thought that has pa&s;t through your mind; the&s;e you will think of in that long Eternity, over and over, a thou&s;and, thou&s;and times, to your unutterable &s;hame, confu&s;ion and angui&s;h of &s;pirit. O then, don't make light of them now!</P>
<P>My little Children, I &s;peak to you, <HI>that ye &s;in not.</HI> I would per&s;wade and charge you, not to neglect any duty, or live in any known &s;in. Don't forget to pray to God in &s;ecret, every day; if you would not go to hell. For God will pour out his fury upon per&s;ons, as well as "families, that call not on his name." Neglect not to read his holy word; and to hear it as often as you can, with &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s and reverence. Spend not your time idly, and &s;infully, in vain company, and car|nal mirth; you will repent it, when it is too late. Don't profane God's holy day. If you allow your&s;elves in playing on the Sabbath, and at Meeting, you cannot be godly, and go to heaven. Sabbath-breakers, are wicked people, tho' there are &s;o many of them. Get out of
<PB N="13" REF="009019_0032_10307289F809BBD0">
the way and company of &s;uch, and go not with them. Let them go to hell without you, if they will go in this high-road thereunto; and &s;hame older per&s;ons out of this evil, by your &s;ober, decent behaviour.</P>
<P>Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth, nor any way of wickedne&s;s be practiced in your life. Walk not in the coun&s;el of the ungodly, nor &s;tand in the way of &s;inners, nor &s;it in the &s;eat of the &s;cornful. "My &s;on, if &s;inners entice thee, con&s;ent thou not." Flee youthful lu&s;ts. Shun the appearance of evil. Quench not the Spirit. Re&s;t not, till you come to &s;ee the hatefulne&s;s of &s;in, and the excellency of Chri&s;t; to love God above all things, and to have the fear of God, even always before your eyes.</P>
<P>But to draw to a clo&s;e.&mdash;I have done &s;peaking to you for this time.</P>
<P>Now tell me, will any of you re&s;olve, by the grace of God; to live &s;oberly, righteou&s;ly and godly?&mdash;to put away childi&s;h, &s;inful things, and choo&s;e the ways of religion, and true holine&s;s? If &s;o, you will be a com|fort and honour to your father that begat you, and to your mother that bear, nouri&s;hed and brought you up; If not, you will be a grief of heart to all that love you, and have a &s;erious concern for you; and it will be good for you, if you had never been born.</P>
<P>What remains, is to beg the ble&s;&s;ing of God on you, and on what has been &s;aid; and that the Spirit of God would accompany it with his effectual Operations; other|wi&s;e, my &s;peaking, and your hearing, will be to no pro|fit; but we &s;hall be eventually the wor&s;e, in&s;tead of the better therefor.</P>
