<P>THe <HI>ESSAY</HI> now before us, is Publi&s;h|ed; Not only that it may be di&s;per&s;ed to afflicted Family's, in a Time of <HI>Epide|mical Sickne&s;s,</HI> when our <HI>Pa&s;tors,</HI> who would fain <HI>Vi&s;it all the Sick,</HI> have not Strength to go thro' a Service, to which, their <HI>Charity</HI> di&s;po&s;es them, as much as their <HI>Mini&s;try</HI> Obliges them.

<HEAD>A Pa&s;toral LETTER, UNTO <HI>Family's that have Sickne&s;s Exerci&s;ing of them, or any one Per&s;on in them.</HI></HEAD>
<P>YOU are &s;o well In&s;tructed, <HI>O our Afflicted Neighbours,</HI> that you can|not be ignorant of this Truth; <HI>Sickne&s;s and Weakne&s;s carry's in it, very &s;trong Obligations to Duty</HI>: And <HI>Sickne&s;s</HI> in a <HI>Family</HI> be&s;peaks <HI>Duty</HI> from no le&s;s than all the <HI>Family.</HI> When <HI>Sickne&s;s</HI> comes into any <HI>Family,</HI> tho' but <HI>One Per&s;on</HI> &s;hould be Vi&s;ited, it admini&s;ters a <HI>Manifold Occa&s;ion</HI> for <HI>Serious Religion</HI> to be Exerci&s;ed by the whole <HI>Family,</HI> even by <HI>every Per&s;on</HI> belong|ing unto it. We have tho't it therefore a part of our <HI>Pa&s;toral Watchfulne&s;s</HI> over you, our Dear Flock, to put into your Hands, (for, alas, how many do <HI>Forget the Exhor|tations</HI> delivered by us, when we manage the Publick <HI>Exhortations</HI>!) a Brief, a Plain, a Faithful <HI>Monitor</HI> of the <HI>Duty,</HI> whereto the Voice of God by <HI>Sickne&s;s</HI> among us, is
<PB N="2" REF="001630_0004_0FB3EA1BC02D0B40">
aloud calling of us. The&s;e are the <HI>Admo|nitions,</HI> whereto your Attention is now demanded in the Name &amp; Fear of God.</P>
<P N="1"><HI>I.</HI> There is a <HI>Duty</HI> incumbent upon the whole <HI>Family,</HI> even upon <HI>every Per&s;on</HI> that can under&s;tand their <HI>Duty,</HI> when <HI>Sickne&s;s</HI> comes upon any Per&s;on in the Family. If any <HI>One Per&s;on</HI> in a Family be under any <HI>Sickne&s;s,</HI> there is an Holy Improvement of it, and an Improvement in Holine&s;s on it, whereof <HI>every Soul</HI> in the Family &s;hould be &s;tudious. Particularly;</P>
<P>Fir&s;t. Let the <HI>whole Family</HI> acknowledge, that the <HI>Sickne&s;s</HI> of any one in the Family, is by the <HI>Providence</HI> of the Great GOD bro't upon them. When there was only a <HI>Child Sick</HI> in a Family, it was &s;aid, 2 Sam. XII.15. <HI>The Lord &s;trook the Child, and it was very Sick.</HI> Tis <HI>Athei&s;m</HI> in us, if we do not own, that a <HI>Sparrow</HI> falls not unto the Ground, without the <HI>Providence</HI> of God; and we are Blinder than the <HI>Owl,</HI> if we &s;ee not the <HI>Providence</HI> of God in it, when <HI>Sick|ne&s;s</HI> threatens to lay any of us or of ours, in the Ground. The <HI>Providence</HI> of God is to be eyed, as in all the <HI>Comforts</HI> of a Fami|ly,
<PB N="3" REF="001630_0005_0FB3EA1D37830388">
&s;o in all the <HI>Troubles</HI> of it. When <HI>Sick|ne&s;s</HI> does <HI>Happen</HI> in a Family, it comes not meerly by <HI>Hap.</HI> It was &s;aid, Amos III.6- <HI>Shall there be Evil in a City, and the Lord hath not done it?</HI> We may &s;ay, <HI>Shall there be Sick|ne&s;s in a Family, and the Lord hath not &s;ent it</HI>? When <HI>Health</HI> is taken away from any of us, tis by the Hand of Him, who is, <HI>The God of our Health.</HI> It was the <HI>Creation</HI> of God, which put our Body's in their good Order at the fir&s;t: If <HI>Sickne&s;s</HI> put our Bo|dy's out of Order, there is the <HI>Providence</HI> of God, ordering of it. Are we <HI>Sick</HI>? We mu&s;t <HI>E&s;teem</HI> our &s;elves to be <HI>Stricken and Smitten of God, and Afflicted.</HI> Indeed, there are &s;ome <HI>Di&s;ea&s;es,</HI> in which the more <HI>Im|mediate Hand</HI> of God, (and of His Angels,) may <HI>Scourge</HI> the Sinful Children of men. The <HI>Lepro&s;y,</HI> as it often Arre&s;ted, fir&s;t, the <HI>Hou&s;es,</HI> and then the <HI>Garments,</HI> and then (upon Impenitency) the <HI>Body's</HI> of the <HI>I&s;|raelites,</HI> in the Holy Land, &s;eems to have been one of tho&s;e Di&s;ea&s;es. And even the mo&s;t Famous Pagan Phy&s;ician, advi&s;es the Practitioners of Phy&s;ick, to mind, whether there be no extraordinary Stamp of a <HI>Di|vine Hand</HI> in tho&s;e Di&s;ea&s;es, which they
<PB N="4" REF="001630_0006_0FB3EA1EACEC6978">
undertake to meddle with. But <HI>every Di|&s;ea&s;e,</HI> whatever be the <HI>Next Cau&s;e</HI> of it, mu&s;t be look'd upon as proceeding from <HI>God,</HI> the <HI>Fir&s;t Cau&s;e</HI> of all. Is any one <HI>Sick</HI> in a <HI>Family</HI>? Let every one there &s;ay, <HI>'Tis the Hand of God that is now upon the Family.</HI> GOD is now fulfilling that word; Mic. VI.13. <HI>I will make thee Sick in &s;miting thee.</HI></P>
<P>But then, Secondly. Should not this <HI>Ac|knowledgment</HI> be accompanied with a &s;uit|able <HI>Humiliation</HI> of the <HI>whole Family,</HI> when <HI>Sickne&s;s</HI> is in a Family? Tis highly Rea&s;o|nable that it &s;hould be &s;o. Where <HI>Sickne&s;s</HI> comes, the Complaint is that, P&s;al. CXLII.6. <HI>I am bro't very Low.</HI> Certainly, it becomes a Family to <HI>lie very Low</HI> before God, when He &s;hall &s;end <HI>Sickne&s;s</HI> into it. <HI>Sickne&s;s</HI> in a Family, does cau&s;e no little <HI>Sorrow</HI> to the Family. Tis an un&s;peakable Encumbrance unto a Family, to have <HI>Sickne&s;s</HI> in it; it Encumbers a Family with a multitude of Inconveniences. The Pale, the Swollen, the Wa&s;ted, &amp; perhaps the Spotted Faces of the <HI>Sick</HI> in the Family, are &s;uch as our Heavenly Father has been <HI>Spitting</HI> upon: Shall <HI>He Spit in our Faces, and &s;hall we not be A&s;hamed</HI>? A Family under the Rebuke of
<PB N="5" REF="001630_0007_0FB3EA2034319280">
God by <HI>Sickne&s;s,</HI> is then to take that Ad|vice, 1 Pet. V.6. <HI>Humble your &s;elves under the Mighty Hand of God.</HI> No <HI>Weary Murmur|ings,</HI> I be&s;eech you, when weary Days, and weary Nights, thro' <HI>Sickne&s;s</HI> are appointed for you! Tis GOD, that hath appointed 'em. Humbly own the <HI>Sovereignty</HI> of God; Say, <HI>Lord, Thou mighte&s;t have made All Sick, as well as One</HI>! Humbly own the <HI>Righteou&s;|ne&s;s</HI> of God; Say, <HI>Lord, We all de&s;erve to be Sick, and are Puni&s;hed le&s;s than our Iniquity's de&s;erve</HI>! Humbly own the <HI>Wi&s;dom</HI> of God, &amp; Submit unto the <HI>Sickne&s;s</HI> in the Family, as a <HI>Cro&s;s</HI> of His lying upon us. The <HI>Sick|ne&s;s</HI> may be called a <HI>Potion,</HI> which our Lord Him&s;elf has mingled for us: It becomes us to &s;ay, <HI>The Cup which my Heavenly Father orders for this Family, &s;hall not I drink of it</HI>? Imitating the words of the <HI>P&s;almi&s;t,</HI> [P&s;al. XXXIX. 9, 10, 11.] Humbly &s;ay; <HI>Lord, I will be Dumb, and not open my Mouth, becau&s;e thou dost what is done in the Family; Tis the &s;troke of thy Hand, that is upon us in our Sick|ne&s;s; We are con&s;umed by the blow of thy Hand. Tis thy Rebuke, that makes what is de&s;irable here to Melt away</HI>!</P>
<P>Thirdly, <HI>Sickne&s;s</HI> bringing &s;uch an <HI>Hu|miliation</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="001630_0008_0FB3EA21AE1AD370">
upon a Family, methinks, it &s;hould al&s;o bring a <HI>Reformation</HI> into the Family. When a <HI>Di&s;temper</HI> comes into a Family, tis very certain, it &s;hould <HI>Cure</HI> every <HI>Di&s;order</HI> in that Family. All the Griefs &amp; Groans of a <HI>Sick</HI> Per&s;on in the Family, are &s;o many Pungent Sermons, for the <HI>Reformation</HI> of all that is ami&s;s; Lively Sermons upon &s;uch a Text as that; Job XXII.23 <HI>Thou &s;halt put away Iniquity far from thy Tabernacles.</HI> When <HI>Sickne&s;s</HI> comes into a Family, it is a <HI>Day of Adver&s;ity,</HI> wherein every one in the Fami|ly &s;hould <HI>Con&s;ider,</HI> how they have Mi&s;car|ry'd, &amp; Reform all their own Mi&s;carriages. But e&s;pecially, it now concerns the <HI>Ma&s;ter</HI> of the Family, &s;o to take the Warning from the <HI>Sickne&s;s</HI> in his Family, as to Reform e|very thing that may be there Provoking to God. My Friend, Let the <HI>Sickne&s;s</HI> there put thee upon awful Tho'ts, what &s;hall now be done, that <HI>Family Piety,</HI> and <HI>Family In|&s;truction,</HI> and <HI>Family Government,</HI> may more flouri&s;h in thy Family, than heretofore. Mo&s;t of all, If any <HI>Ma&s;ter</HI> of a Family, hath been &s;o very Criminal, as to neglect <HI>Family Prayer,</HI> let him hear the Cry of the <HI>Sickne&s;s</HI> in his Family unto him, thus Articulated;
<PB N="7" REF="001630_0009_0FB3EA232DFD7000">
<HI>Oh! Neglect Family Prayer no Longer</HI>! Now call thy Folks together; tell them that thy <HI>Family,</HI> whereto the God of Heaven &s;peaks by the <HI>Sickne&s;s</HI> now upon it, &s;hall be no longer <HI>Prayerle&s;s</HI>; tell them thou art afraid le&s;t God go on to <HI>pour out His Fury</HI> in &s;ome|thing wor&s;e than <HI>Sickne&s;s,</HI> upon a <HI>Family that Calls not on His Name</HI>: Fall down upon thy Knees in the mid&s;t of them, &amp; &s;pread the Sins, the Wants, the Fears, &amp; the De&s;ires of thy <HI>Family,</HI> as well as thou can&s;t before the Lord. <HI>Happy &amp; Healthy, that Sickne&s;s, which thus Reforms the Family that it comes into</HI>!</P>
<P>More than &s;o; Fourthly. If it be a Time of <HI>General Sickne&s;s,</HI> we &s;hould all in General joyn in the Methods of Devotion, to obtain a &s;top to the Judgment, by the Efficacy of the <HI>Great Sacrifice for the Congregation.</HI> Some|times a <HI>Sickne&s;s</HI> rages in a Place; and not one or two, but many <HI>Family's</HI> are Vi&s;ited. Now 'tis a Time for all the <HI>Family's</HI> in a Neighbourhood, Unanimou&s;ly to Concur in more than ordinary Supplications. The Cry of a Raging and Spreading <HI>Sickne&s;s</HI> to a whole Neighbourhood, is that, Jon. III.8. <HI>Fa&s;t, and Cry mightily unto God, and turn every one from his Evil Way.</HI> But that the Sup|plications
<PB N="8" REF="001630_0010_0FB3EA24B1996B10">
may become Effectual, there is one Signal and Glorious point of Chri&s;tia|nity to be ob&s;erv'd. There are <HI>De&s;troying Angels,</HI> as with <HI>Drawn Swords,</HI> by a Commi&s;|&s;ion from God, inflicting of &s;uch a <HI>Sickne&s;s,</HI> for the <HI>De&s;truction,</HI> or at lea&s;t the <HI>Vexation</HI> of the Inhabitants. The way to prevail with God, for the preventing of &s;uch a dreadful Commi&s;&s;ion, is to Bring &amp; Plead a <HI>Sacrifice.</HI> It was of old &s;aid, Numb XIV.46. <HI>Bring Incen&s;e, go quickly, &amp; make Atonement; for there is Wrath gone out from the Lord; the Plague is begun.</HI> But what <HI>Sacrifice</HI> have we to Plead in this Ca&s;e? None truly, but the Al&s;ufficient <HI>Sacrifice</HI> of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t. We are then to Plead this with God; <HI>O Mo&s;t Glorious God; Our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t hath Suffered that ju&s;t Wrath of thine, which is due to us for our Sins: Let the Suffer|ings of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t &s;ave us from thy Wrath: Oh, Pity us, and Pardon us, and let us be &s;aved from horrible Sickne&s;&s;es, for the &s;ake of tho&s;e Expiatory Sufferings wherein our Lord Je&s;us <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> born our Sickne&s;&s;es.</HI> Chri&s;ti|ans, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">; The Believers who &s;o Pre|&s;ent before God the <HI>Sacrifice</HI> of the Lord Je|&s;us Chri&s;t, on the behalf of the <HI>Towns</HI> where
<PB N="9" REF="001630_0011_0FB3EA2637D16208">
they Live, are the very <HI>Gapmen</HI> of the Towns. And by this <HI>Faith</HI> in that <HI>Great Sacrifice,</HI> we may particularly procure our own <HI>Hou&s;es</HI> to be <HI>Sprinkled</HI> with that <HI>Blood,</HI> be which our <HI>Family's</HI> may be <HI>pre&s;erved in Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> Oh! Nothing &s;o Grateful to the Ble&s;&s;ed God; no Plea &s;o Powerful, as to mention the <HI>Blood</HI> of His <HI>Beloved</HI> Son before Him.</P>
<P N="2"><HI>II.</HI> There is a <HI>Duty</HI> incumbent on &s;uch in the Family, as are not <HI>lying under Sickne&s;s,</HI> when <HI>Sickne&s;s</HI> lies upon others in the <HI>Fami|ly.</HI> A <HI>Sickne&s;s</HI> of any one in a Family, gives many <HI>Healthful Coun&s;ils,</HI> to tho&s;e that are yet in <HI>Health.</HI> For;</P>
<P>Fir&s;t. The <HI>Sickne&s;s</HI> of any One in a Fa|mily, &s;hould engage the re&s;t that are in Health to be very <HI>Thankful</HI> for their Health. It would indeed be worthy of a, <HI>Lord, have Mercy upon us,</HI> on the Door, if all in a Fa|mily &s;hould be <HI>Sick.</HI> An <HI>Healthful</HI> Per&s;on, has always very great cau&s;e to be a <HI>Thank|ful</HI> Per&s;on. What &s;ays the <HI>P&s;almi&s;t</HI>? P&s;al. XLII. 11. <HI>I will Prai&s;e Him who is the Health of my Countenance.</HI> But the <HI>Sickne&s;s</HI> of any <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> unto us, aggravates the Cau&s;e, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> for <HI>Thankfulne&s;s.</HI> Our <HI>Health,</HI> when
<PB N="10" REF="001630_0012_0FB3EA27C569B630">
others are <HI>Sick,</HI> as 'tis a <HI>Di&s;tingui&s;hing</HI> Fa|vour, &s;o 'tis an <HI>Unmerited</HI> Favour. <HI>Why me, Lord</HI>! When others are Pining in Sick|ne&s;s, there can be no Rea&s;on a&s;&s;ign'd for the Mercy of God, in &s;paring our Health, but only the <HI>Meer Mercy</HI> of God. This affords a very cogent Rea&s;on, why we &s;hould be very Thankful for the Mercy! Well then; See thy <HI>Sick</HI> Friend Sweating, Hear thy <HI>Sick</HI> Friend Sighing, under <HI>Sickne&s;s,</HI> when <HI>Cha&s;tened on their Bed</HI>: Their <HI>Soul abhors all manner of Meat,</HI> they <HI>Draw near unto the Gates of Death,</HI> they Pant, they Faint, they can hardly Speak: But all this while, they <HI>Cry aloud</HI> unto thee: <HI>Oh! Prize thy preci|ous Health, and Prai&s;e Merciful God, for a Mercy that never can be Prized Enough</HI>!</P>
<P>Secondly. And yet, <HI>Prepare for Sickne&s;s</HI>! The <HI>Sickne&s;s</HI> of One in a Family, bids all the re&s;t, <HI>Prepare to be Sick.</HI> The <HI>Feeble Voice</HI> of the <HI>Sick,</HI> it as Notably, as if they &s;hould <HI>Lift up their Voice like a Trumpet,</HI> Speaks unto us, that; I&s;a. XL.6. <HI>All Fle&s;h is Gra&s;s, and all the Goodline&s;s thereof, is as the Flower of the Field. Sickne&s;s</HI> in a Family, is a Lecture upon <HI>Humane Frailty</HI>: And the Language of it, is <HI>Oh! Do with thy Might
<PB N="11" REF="001630_0013_0FB3EA292B648158">
what thy Hand finds to do, while thou art in thy Health; and leave not unto a Time of Sick|ne&s;s, the doing of tho&s;e things, for which there is no Time in Sickne&s;s</HI>! If it be Nece&s;&s;ary for us, to make, A WILL, that Right and Peace, may not be injured when we are Dead, a <HI>Sick</HI> Per&s;on in a Family will &s;how us, that we &s;hould not have this to do, when we come to be <HI>Sick.</HI> But above all, Tis Nece&s;&s;ary for us, to make a <HI>Timely Pro|vi&s;ion for Eternity.</HI> This PROVISION is made, How? By Con&s;enting to every Ar|ticle, in the <HI>Covenant of Grace; By</HI> Submit|ting to the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, as our <HI>Prie&s;t,</HI> our <HI>Prophet,</HI> and our <HI>King; By</HI> Accepting of, the <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s</HI> which our <HI>Surety</HI> has Wrought out for us, that we may therein &s;tand Righteous before the <HI>Judge of All</HI>; And <HI>By</HI> Complying with the <HI>Holy Spirit,</HI> who offers to <HI>Renew</HI> us, and <HI>Po&s;&s;e&s;s</HI> us, and <HI>Com<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">rt</HI> us to God, and <HI>Unite</HI> us to Chri&s;t, and <HI>Re&s;cue</HI> us from Sin, and <HI>Prepare</HI> us for Heaven. Immortal Soul; <HI>Nece&s;&s;ity is laid upon thee to do the&s;e things, and Wo unto thee, if thou do them not.</HI> But will a <HI>Sick Bed</HI> af|ford a <HI>Proper Sea&s;on,</HI> for the doing of &s;uch things? It may be, you have not heard,
<PB N="12" REF="001630_0014_0FB3EA2AAAAEB260">
(as I have) the Mi&s;erables upon a <HI>Sick Bed,</HI> Crying out with inexpre&s;&s;ible An|gui&s;h; <HI>In my Health, I made no Preparation for Death! And, O Sir, It is not now too Late? Is it not now too Late?</HI> But the <HI>Sickne&s;s</HI> in your Family, may terribly inculcate this Cauti|on upon you; <HI>Don't, Oh! Don't put off your Turning to God, until you come to be Sick: You'll make Poor, Mean, Sickly, and mo&s;t Un|certain Work of it, if you do.</HI></P>
<P>And Thirdly. Have they that are in <HI>Health,</HI> nothing to do for the <HI>Sick</HI> in the Family? Yes; We &s;hould <HI>Exhort one ano|ther,</HI> whom we &s;ee under <HI>Sickne&s;s; and &s;o much the more, as we &s;ee the Day approaching,</HI> wherein they are to take that Important Step, which their Everla&s;ting Weal or Wo turns upon. Oh! Drop as many <HI>Sound Words</HI> as we can, upon our <HI>Sick Friends.</HI> And Speak <HI>For</HI> them, as well as <HI>To</HI> them. Carry them to our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, by our <HI>Prayers</HI> for His Help, as they did of old, and found it not in vain to do &s;o. Yea, Pray <HI>With</HI> them too, as well as <HI>For</HI> them, if it may be done with Decency. <HI>Husbands,</HI> and <HI>Parents,</HI> and <HI>Ma&s;ters</HI> in the Family, can do no le&s;s. It is &s;aid, Jam. V.16. <HI>The Prayer
