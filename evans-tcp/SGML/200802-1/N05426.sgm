<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR!</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT would be a Defect both in Gratitude and Duty, if the fir&s;t Di&s;cour&s;e from the Pulpit in Favour of INOCULATION, was not mo&s;t humbly in&s;cribed to YOUR MAJESTY.</P>
<P>THE Nation, among numerous other In&s;tances of paternal Regard, &s;tands obli+ged to YOUR MAJESTY's Goodne&s;s and Re&s;olution, for the Introduction and Pro|gre&s;s of that &s;alutary Practice.</P>
<P>THE very early Concern YOUR MAJESTY &s;hewed for the Safety and Happine&s;s of this Kingdom, by expo&s;ing Your own va|luable Life, with great Intrepidity, to all the Hazards of War, was again apparent, when, with equal Firmne&s;s of Mind, You

<P>AND probably to thisOperation we owe the Life of that illu&s;trious PRINCE, to whom, under Divine Providence, this Nation, and the whole Prote&s;tant Intere&s;t, are &s;o deeply indebted, for the happy Victory at the Battle of <HI>Colloden.</HI></P>
<P>THAT YOUR MAJESTY's vigilant At|tention to the Welfare of Your People, in all Re&s;pects, may be rewarded with a very long and happy Reign upon Earth, and crowned with immortal Glory in Heaven, is the ardent Prayer of,</P>

<P>THESE Words are Part of a De&s;cription of that <HI>Humiliation</HI> and Wor&s;hip, that is <HI>really acceptable</HI> to the great Creator and Go|vernor of the World; as highly proper in it&s;elf, and as a ju&s;t Imitation of his divine Goodne&s;s, <HI>which regardeth the Prayer of the poor De|&s;titute, and de&s;pi&s;eth not his De&s;ire</HI>; and which, in the &s;acred Writings, is &s;o frequently repre&s;ented, both as an <HI>Example</HI> and an <HI>Encouragement</HI> to human Benevo|lence.</P>
<P>IS not <HI>this</HI> the <HI>Fa&s;t,</HI> &s;ays Almighty God, <HI>ver.</HI> 6. <HI>that I have cho&s;en, to loo&s;e the Bands of Wickedne&s;s,&mdash; to undo the heavy Burdens</HI>; &mdash; is it not to <HI>deal thy Bread to the Hungry; and that thou bring the Poor that are ca&s;t out,</HI> (ca&s;t out and <HI>afflicted,</HI> as the original Word al&s;o &s;ignifies) <HI>to thy Hou&s;e</HI>? and that thou <HI>hide not</HI> thy&s;elf from <HI>thine own Fle&s;h</HI>?</P>
<P>THE &s;ore Di&s;tre&s;s of our Fellow-creatures, our own Fle&s;h, literally <HI>ca&s;t out and afflicted,</HI> which occa&s;ions the pre&s;ent Solemnity, falls very naturally under the Command of the Text, <HI>Bring the</HI> Poor <HI>that are</HI> ca&s;t out <HI>to thy</HI> Hou&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="006871_0005_102A8172878ACD28">THE SMALL POX is a well known Di&s;temper, to which Providence has been plea&s;ed to &s;ubject Mankind, the Seeds of it being intermixed with the human Con|&s;titution; this may be &s;aid <HI>in general,</HI> becau&s;e the In|&s;tances of tho&s;e, who <HI>pa&s;s through</HI> Life, after having arrived at Manhood, and <HI>having been within the Reach of Infection,</HI> are &s;o <HI>extremely few,</HI> as &s;carce to form an Exception; learned Calculations have made it as one to many Hundreds.</P>
<P>AT the &s;ame Time, this <HI>almo&s;t univer&s;al Di&s;ea&s;e</HI> is very <HI>loath&s;ome</HI> and <HI>nau&s;eous</HI> both to the <HI>Sufferers</HI> and <HI>tho&s;e who attend them</HI>; &s;o <HI>&s;preading</HI> and <HI>infectious,</HI> as to prevent all friendly A&s;&s;i&s;tance from Per&s;ons who have not them&s;elves undergone the Di&s;temper; and likewi&s;e &s;o <HI>pernicious</HI> and <HI>fatal,</HI> as, upon a very <HI>mode|rate Calculation,</HI> to de&s;troy <HI>One in Seven</HI> of all whom it attacks, and very <HI>often</HI> in much <HI>greater</HI> Proportion. An In&s;trument of Death that &s;lays without Di&s;tinction! Youth and Beauty, Dignity and Power, Wealth and Affluence, are no Protection; the Palace and the Cot|tage &s;tand in this re&s;pect upon a Level, and the <HI>Rich</HI> and <HI>the Poor meet</HI> and <HI>fall together</HI>; po&s;&s;ibly with &s;ome <HI>Di&s;advantage</HI> to the former, if <HI>their</HI> Blood has been inflamed by luxurious Diet and high Living.</P>
<P>AND where Numbers of Men are collected together, as in Garri&s;ons, Regiments, or the Crew of a Ship, the Havock is prodigious; which in &s;ome Junctures <HI>has been,</HI> and therefore <HI>may be,</HI> highly prejudicial in <HI>a nati|onal View,</HI> be&s;ides the Lo&s;s of Lives.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Confu&s;ion</HI> and Terror of the <HI>Inhabitants,</HI> the <HI>Ce&s;&s;ation</HI> of Trade and Bu&s;ine&s;s, and the <HI>great Slaughter</HI> made by this dreadful Malady when, like a <HI>de&s;troying Angel,</HI> it attacks populous Towns and Villages, are extreamly certain and notorious.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="006871_0006_102A81741AC24010">NOW, the <HI>general</HI> View of the pre&s;ent charitable Un|dertaking, is with God's Ble&s;&s;ing, to render this grie|vous Di&s;temper <HI>le&s;s</HI> de&s;tructive, and dimini&s;h that hor|rid Deva&s;tation which it <HI>now</HI> continually makes among the human Species.</P>
<P>AND the Relief <HI>here</HI> propos'd to the Poor, is accor|dingly pur&s;ued by <HI>two</HI> different Methods; the one is, as it were <HI>preventive,</HI> to le&s;&s;en the <HI>Violence</HI> and the <HI>Dan|ger</HI> of this <HI>malignant Di&s;ea&s;e</HI>; the other is to &s;upply in|digent, di&s;tre&s;s'd, Patients, who <HI>actually</HI> labour under it <HI>by common Infection,</HI> with all nece&s;&s;ary A&s;&s;i&s;tance and Relief. The Aim of the previous Method is this, <HI>viz.</HI> After due Preparation, in a <HI>known,</HI> vi&s;ible Manner, to rai&s;e that Commotion in the Blood, which &s;ends forth in|to the Surface of the Body the latent Materials of this Di&s;temper &s;o very dangerous, when excited in the com|mon Way by infectious Particles unperceived. It &s;eems therefore (like the rai&s;ing a Fit of the Gout, when the Particles of that painful Malady are di&s;per&s;ed thro' the whole Ma&s;s of Blood) not &s;o properly the giving a Di&s;temper to a human Body intirely free from and out of Danger of that Di&s;temper, as choo&s;ing the <HI>&s;afe&s;t</HI> Time and Manner of cau&s;ing a Di&s;order, otherwi&s;e al|mo&s;t unavoidable in a Way extremely more pernicious, the Fuel thereof being lodged within us. An <HI>Intention</HI> beyond all <HI>Di&s;pute</HI> worthy of much <HI>Approbation</HI>; and which &s;hould always be pur&s;ued with the utmo&s;t Care and Precaution both in the Choice of the Per&s;on from whom the infectious Matter is collected, and of unex|ceptionable Subjects, upon whom the Operation is per|form'd.</P>
<P>IT is needle&s;s to enter into a Di&s;qui&s;ition, which is the propere&s;t Method of <HI>de&s;ignedly</HI> rai&s;ing this Di&s;order in the Human Frame, by <HI>carrying</HI> the Per&s;on that is to receive it to the <HI>contagious Steams</HI> or Effluvia; on,
<PB N="4" REF="006871_0007_102A8178F9AB3AB8">
<HI>bringing</HI> to him the <HI>infected</HI> Matter. <HI>Religious</HI> Difficul|ties (<HI>if any &s;till remain</HI> concerning a Practice, that has pre&s;erv'd &s;o many Lives, and prevented the heavie&s;t Grief in &s;o many Families) are <HI>exactly the &s;ame,</HI> in either Method of <HI>voluntary</HI> Communication.</P>
<P>FOR 'tis no more invading the Prerogative of Heaven, to occa&s;ion one ea&s;y and voluntary Conveyance of the Infection than another; by a <HI>&s;light</HI> and <HI>hardly</HI> &s;en&s;ible Ra&s;ure upon the Skin of the Arm, than communicating the &s;ame Di&s;temper by invi&s;ible Particles, to that tender Organ the Lungs, which are &s;o frequently affected by the Venom of this Di&s;ea&s;e, when contracted by the Breath, or receiving into the Body infected Particles in what is called the natural Way.</P>
<P>WERE this <HI>preventive</HI> Method <HI>univer&s;ally &s;ucce&s;sful,</HI> and never <HI>once</HI> to fail in <HI>any</HI> In&s;tance what&s;oever, 'tis &s;carce to be pre&s;umed that any Objection would be rai&s;ed again&s;t a &s;alutary Expedient, to pre&s;erve from De&s;truction &s;o great a Part of the human Species, as daily fall by this mortal Enemy, when it attacks Men as it were in the Dark, <HI>ignorant</HI> of, and <HI>unprepar'd</HI> for the A&s;&s;ault.</P>
<P>THIS Method of Inoculation would then be no more liable to Cen&s;ure, than the making a <HI>voluntary</HI> Wound, by <HI>Inci&s;ion,</HI> to form a nece&s;&s;ary Drain; or admini&s;tring any operative Medicine, which upon <HI>repeated Trials</HI> had prov'd an <HI>unfailing Security</HI> again&s;t any other <HI>dangerous</HI> and <HI>prevailing</HI> Pe&s;tilence or Contagion.</P>
<P>BUT, in order to <HI>excite</HI> and <HI>&s;ecure</HI> a <HI>Dependence</HI> upon his <HI>Divine Providence,</HI> the GREAT GOVERNOR of the World has appointed that no human Affairs, not even our nece&s;&s;ary <HI>Su&s;tenance,</HI> &s;hould be attended with &s;uch <HI>ab&s;olute</HI> Certainty; a very wi&s;e Appointment! That <HI>vain</HI> Man might not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> him&s;elf an <HI>independent</HI>

Being, but <HI>among</HI> all the <HI>Changes</HI> and <HI>Chances</HI> of this mortal Life, &s;hould &s;till look up unto, becau&s;e he can only be defended by, God's mo&s;t gracious and ready Help.</P>
<P>EXPERIENCE alone mu&s;t <HI>determine</HI> the good or bad Con&s;equences of this artificial Infection, as it ought to do in <HI>all other</HI> medical Attempts, which in many In&s;tances are, in <HI>reality,</HI> little more than curing or alleviating <HI>one</HI> Di&s;temper, by exciting or introducing <HI>another.</HI> And in this View the Method, now under Con&s;ideration, of le&s;|&s;ening the Hazard of a very mortal Di&s;ea&s;e, &s;hould be con&s;idered in the &s;ame Light as every other <HI>Antidote,</HI> or <HI>preventive</HI> Attempt in Phy&s;ic or Surgery, again&s;t any probable, almo&s;t certain Malady, internal or external. I forbear therefore to derive any Strength to the Argu|ment, from the great Number of <HI>noble, venerable,</HI> and <HI>worthy</HI> Per&s;ons of every <HI>Rank</HI> and <HI>Profe&s;&s;ion,</HI> who ap|pear the public Advocates of this compa&s;&s;ionate De&s;ign: Let it &s;tand upon its own proper Evidence, and Founda|tion.</P>
<P>A SAFE Pa&s;&s;age thro' this Di&s;temper, like the eman|cipating <HI>Slaves,</HI> is a Deliverance to va&s;t Numbers of People, kept as it were in <HI>Bondage</HI>; who, <HI>before</HI> they have undergone this <HI>abhorred</HI> Di&s;ea&s;e, are <HI>excluded</HI> from <HI>many</HI> Offices of Life, and prevented from pur&s;uing their nece&s;&s;ary Bu&s;ine&s;s; and it gives Tranquillity and Chear|fulne&s;s to Per&s;ons of better Condition, who under Ap|prehen&s;ions of this loath&s;ome and infectious Di&s;order, were all their former Days &s;ubject to great Anxiety and con&s;tant Fear.</P>
<P>'TIS needle&s;s to enter into a Di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of &s;everal Ob|jections, that attended the Infancy of this u&s;eful Practice, which Time and fuller Experience have now removed; with re&s;pect to the Communication of <HI>other Di&s;ea&s;es</HI> with the varielous Matter; or that certain Ails and Complaints
<PB N="6" REF="006871_0009_102A8180E3BC54A8">
have follow'd the inoculated Di&s;temper; of both which Inconveniencies there is <HI>at lea&s;t</HI> an equal Hazard upon Infection, by an unperceiv'd Contagion, that, like a <HI>Pe&s;tilence walketh in Darkne&s;s</HI>: Or that the Di&s;ea&s;e is more likely to return after Inoculation. The large Ex|perience of many Years has now effectually removed all the&s;e Objections, nor can it be wondred at, if in the <HI>In|fancy</HI> of the Practice <HI>e&s;pecially,</HI> &s;ome few Attempts have prov'd ineffectual.</P>
<P>BEYOND all Di&s;pute, in the <HI>voluntary</HI> Communica|tion of this Di&s;ea&s;e, there is an happy Opportunity to choo&s;e&mdash;The be&s;t Sea&s;on of the Year &mdash; The early, the propere&s;t Time of Life&mdash; A Juncture when the <HI>Di&s;ea&s;e</HI> it &s;elf is mo&s;t <HI>favourable,</HI> and the Blood is in a right State to receive it, neither too much enriched, nor too much impoveri&s;hed &mdash; To prevent treating the fir&s;t <HI>doubtful</HI> Symptoms in an improper manner&mdash; To avoid <HI>Cold,</HI> or <HI>Inflammation</HI> of the Blood, by Food, Liquors, or Exerci&s;e, after the <HI>known</HI> Infection is received.</P>
<P>BUT to proceed to the only &s;ure Evidence, real Ex|perience and Matter of Fact; in which almo&s;t every Part of the Globe, <HI>A&s;ia, Europe</HI> and <HI>America</HI> give a concurrent Te&s;timony &mdash; GREAT BRITAIN in particular has now had a Trial of this voluntary Method of artifi|cially exciting the Di&s;temper for <HI>near thirty Years</HI> at different Times, and di&s;tant Places, with very great Succe&s;s.</P>
<P>AT <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> indeed, in this, as in other very u&s;eful Ar|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">s, the Succe&s;s was far inferior to what longer Expe|rience, and repeated Trials have <HI>now &s;o happily accom|pli&s;hed,</HI> in this <HI>Metropolis,</HI> as well as in diver&s;e other Places, particularly in that u&s;eful E&s;tabli&s;hment formed for the Reception of de&s;erted young Children; and more e&s;pecially in <HI>this Ho&s;pital</HI> peculiarly in&s;tituted for

this good Purpo&s;e, being <HI>one Branch</HI> of the Charity for which we are now a&s;&s;embled.</P>
<P>BESIDES this <HI>general Evidence</HI> of the Advantages of Inoculation, I can &s;peak with more A&s;&s;urance upon the beneficial Effects of that Operation, becau&s;e I &s;peak up|on full Information, and by the Permi&s;&s;ion of three Gentlemen in particular, of de&s;erved Eminence and Di&s;|tinction in the Profe&s;&s;ion <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Serjeant <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, Mr. Serjeant <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, and Mr. <HI>Middleton&punc;</HI> The Nation may &s;oon hope for a very compleat, u&s;eful, and welcome Account of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> the fir&s;t of the&s;e learned Hand<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE>, who have been very largely employed for a con&s;iderable Time, in this &s;alutary Prac|tice. It cannot therefore fail to give this worthy Audi|ence much Satisfaction, to be thus authentically a&s;&s;ured;</P>
<P N="1">I. That the artificial Communication of <HI>the Small Pox by Inoculation,</HI> is, almo&s;t without Exception, an effectual Security again&s;t that dangerous Symptom the <HI>&s;econd</HI> Fever, which de&s;troys &s;o great Part of tho&s;e who peri&s;h in the natural Way.</P>
<P N="2">II. That under Inoculation, there is &s;carce any Diffi|culty in Breathing or Complaint upon the Lungs, which Di&s;order produces &s;o many bad Effects when the Di&s;temper is received in the unknown and acci|dental Manner.</P>
<P N="3">The III^d and mo&s;t material Article is the great and happy Succe&s;s, as to Numbers, with which God's good Providence has ble&s;&s;ed this u&s;eful Operation; Great, beyond the mo&s;t &s;anguine Hopes; &s;o great that in above FIFTEEN HUNDRED Per&s;ons inocu|lated by the&s;e eminent Hands, only <HI>three</HI> have
<PB N="8" REF="006871_0011_102A81889909CE28">
died; and this very material Fact is al&s;o confirmed by unexceptionable Accounts from diver&s;e other Places <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Thus, for Example, the learned Dr. <HI>Langri&s;h</HI> of <HI>Winche&s;ter,</HI> gives the following Account:</P>
<P><Q>About ten Years ago the Small Pox raged furiou&s;ly in <HI>Winche&s;ter,</HI> and &s;ome neighbouring Towns, and in the natural Way proved an unkind Sort, which induced great Numbers to be inoculated. In PORTSMOUTH, CHICHESTER, GUILFORD, PETERSFIELD, and WINCHESTER, we reckon near two thou&s;and that were inoculated at that Time, and (except two Women, who were <HI>both with Child,</HI> and both inoculated <HI>contrary</HI> to the Advice of their Phy&s;ician I don't remember to have heard of any one bad Accident that befel any of them, but what might very rea&s;onably have been &s;uppo&s;ed to have proved wor&s;e, if they had had the Small Pox in the natural Way. More than this, I think, can't well be &s;aid to prove the U&s;efulne&s;s of Inoculation.</Q></P></NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT that a Matter of &s;uch Importance many be brought to &s;ome apparent Certainty, it may not be improper to enter a little into Calculation.</P>
<P>FROM the <HI>annual Account</HI> within the Bills of Mortality (in which many Places in and near the City are omitted) it appears, that in <HI>twenty Years, viz.</HI> from the Year 1731 to the Year 1750 inclu&s;ive, no le&s;s than 39,115 Per&s;ons have died of this fatal Di&s;temper; which, inclu|ding the Places not in&s;erted in the Weekly Bills, mu&s;t be con&s;iderably more than 2,000 every Year that fall in the two adjoining Cities and Parts adjacent.</P>
<P>AND if only <HI>one</HI> in <HI>&s;even</HI> (which is a very &s;ufficient Allowance) is &s;uppo&s;ed to die by the Di&s;temper taken in the <HI>natural Way,</HI> then the whole Number of Per&s;ons who in this Period of <HI>twenty Years</HI> have been thus in|fected, amounts to 280,000, and of the&s;e no le&s;s than 40,000 have peri&s;hed.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="006871_0012_102A818ECAEE8DB0">BUT if in every TWO HUNDRED <HI>One</HI> &s;hould be &s;up|po&s;ed to die <HI>under Inoculation,</HI> which, as ob&s;erved al|ready, is really much more than fall by that artificial Infection, now continually advancing with increa&s;ing Safety; and the certain Fact, as above-mentioned, is only <HI>One</HI> in 500, being le&s;s than half of the Number I have &s;tated &mdash; But &s;uppo&s;e I &s;ay <HI>One</HI> in 200 to die under <HI>Inoculation,</HI> then had this artificial Method of conveying the Di&s;temper univer&s;ally taken place, in&s;tead of that prodigious De&s;truction of Mankind, 40,000 in the Space of 20 Years in one Di&s;trict, no more than 1400 had peri&s;hed; and the Difference in that &s;hort Period would have been no le&s;s than THIRTY-EIGHT THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED Lives pre&s;erved, be&s;ides the numerous Po&s;terity that might have been derived from them. And were this Practice univer&s;al in the&s;e two Cities <HI>only</HI> NINETEEN HUNDRED AND THIRTY Lives, under the Ble&s;&s;ing of God, would be annually pre&s;erved.</P>
<P>'TIS a plea&s;ing Ob&s;ervation, That the Slaughter made by this formidable Di&s;temper is greatly decrea&s;ed, the Numbers as recorded in the Yearly Bills, being one-fifth le&s;&s;ened <HI>&s;ince</HI> this Practice has prevailed.</P>

<P>BUT it is high time to turn our Thoughts to the other Branch of this great and nece&s;&s;ary Undertaking, the <HI>Relief</HI> of de&s;titute and mi&s;erable Creatures, labour|ing under this <HI>dreadful</HI> Di&s;temper, contracted by com|mon Infection.</P>
<P>THIS mournful Ca&s;e is peculiarly affecting, as the&s;e wretched Sufferers are &s;o <HI>really ca&s;t out</HI> and <HI>afflicted</HI>; afflicted with one of the <HI>&s;ore&s;t Maladies</HI> incident to hu|man Nature, <HI>ca&s;t out</HI> and abandoned of all human Help.</P>
<P>THIS beneficial Charity therefore is not a new In&s;ti|tution, but a mo&s;t de&s;irable Addition, and a nece&s;&s;ary Supplement to all other <HI>Ho&s;pitals,</HI> &s;ince from all other <HI>Ho&s;pitals</HI> the&s;e de&s;titute and mi&s;erable Objects are <HI>una|voidably excluded,</HI> and &s;ometimes even forcibly expelled, in the <HI>utmo&s;t Di&s;tre&s;s,</HI> and without any Place of <HI>Refuge</HI>!</P>
<P>THE u&s;ual <HI>Danger</HI> of this terrible Di&s;ea&s;e, is by this Means greatly increa&s;ed, I might &s;ay a&s;certained by their ab&s;olute want of all nece&s;&s;ary Care and A&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>CAN Thought conceive a more deplorable Condition, or is any Sorrow like unto their Sorrow? Nor <HI>Food,</HI> nor <HI>Phy&s;ic,</HI> nor <HI>Bed</HI> to lie upon, nor <HI>Hou&s;e</HI> to cover
<PB N="11" REF="006871_0014_102A819480A4E2F0">
their di&s;ea&s;ed Bodies from the colde&s;t Bla&s;ts of the open Air! This is no Picture drawn by Imagination, but real and certain tho' mo&s;t melancholy Fact, which, to the Knowledge of many who now hear me, has occur|red in numerous, affecting, &s;hocking In&s;tances, one of which would be &s;ufficient to move the harde&s;t Heart of any Spectator.</P>
<P>PERSONS unavoidably driven out from other Ho&s;pi|tals, as &s;oon as this Di&s;temper appears to be their real Complaint; indu&s;trious Labourers that come from far, in the bu&s;y Time of Harve&s;t, with many others, in &s;imi|lar Circum&s;tances, make up the In&s;tances that &s;o fre|quently occur, of <HI>wretched</HI> Objects <HI>quite de&s;titute</HI> of <HI>Friends,</HI> or <HI>Habitation</HI> into which they can gain Admi|&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>BUT where the Calamity does not reach this extream Degree of Woe and Mi&s;ery, there is &s;till, in too many &s;ad In&s;tances, Di&s;tre&s;s enough to melt any human Heart.</P>
<P>TAKE, for <HI>Example,</HI> a Ca&s;e that lately happened, &mdash;</P>
<P>A POOR Man &s;ick of this <HI>Di&s;temper,</HI> of which his <HI>Wife</HI> lay dead in the <HI>&s;ame</HI> Room, with <HI>four Children</HI> around him <HI>catching the dreadful Infection,</HI> but de&s;titute of <HI>all</HI> Relief, till they found <HI>&s;ome</HI> in that too narrow Building, which now importunately begs your compa&s;&s;ionate Bounty to enlarge its Dimen&s;ions, that you may <HI>then,</HI> without <HI>Repul&s;e</HI> or <HI>Refu&s;al,</HI> bring the <HI>Poor</HI> that <HI>are ca&s;t out</HI> and <HI>afflicted,</HI> to <HI>a Hou&s;e of Mercy</HI>!</P>
<P>IT would afford greater Joy to reflect, tho' &s;ome have died in this Place, and no wonder, when they often come almo&s;t in the la&s;t Stage of the Di&s;temper, that yet near 800 poor Creatures have, by the Ble&s;&s;ing of the Almighty, received a Cure under this pious and
<PB N="12" REF="006871_0015_102A81981F872EA8">
charitable In&s;titution, were not this Joy darkened by a Cloud of unrelieved Di&s;tre&s;s and Mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>BUT cruel it would be, in the highe&s;t Degree, to poor rejected Supplicants, and unfaithful to the Nation, not to publi&s;h, that the pre&s;ent Supplies for this excel|lent and nece&s;&s;ary Undertaking, are &s;o defective and inadequate, that the Doors of this charitable Hou&s;e, all the Beds being full, are continually &s;hut again&s;t a great Number of mi&s;erable Objects, &s;ometimes <HI>&s;even</HI> or <HI>eight,</HI> in one Day, who implore Admittance; but, ala&s;s! im|plore in vain! The Extent of the pre&s;ent Building is by much too &s;mall, and the pre&s;ent Fund quite in&s;ufficient to enlarge it. Be&s;ides that Angui&s;h of Heart which the&s;e unhappy Creatures feel, upon being rejected, the Publick al&s;o may &s;uffer greatly.</P>
<P>FOR, could &s;uch poor Wretches be received into an <HI>Ho&s;pital</HI> before the Di&s;ea&s;e becomes infectious, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is greatly to be wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ed, that the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Care was taken, upon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Occa&s;ions. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> Di&s;temper, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> is u&s;ually taken to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> involuntary <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"></NOTE> and continued there till they had obtain'd a Cure, and the Infection cea&s;ed; the &s;preading of this pernicious Ma|lady might be very much le&s;&s;en'd, which now in a Cour&s;e of Communication of its &s;ubtile Particles goes far and wide, and &s;ometimes makes &s;ad Deva&s;tation in the be&s;t and greate&s;t Hou&s;es. I de&s;ire not to open the Wounds of tho&s;e I greatly regard, or revive my own Sympathy for the affecting Lo&s;&s;es, in the Prime and Bloom of Life, &s;o many noble and re&s;pectable Families have &s;u&s;tain'd by this undi&s;tingui&s;hing De&s;troyer. 'Tis too melancholy a Thought to dwell upon, and is men|tioned only to excite our Attention to that Practice which renders this grievous Malady le&s;s fatal, and to

<P>MAN, it is always &s;aid, is a &s;ocial Creature, and it is no le&s;s certain that he ought to be a religious one; but if ever this Character can &s;hine with di&s;tingui&s;hed Lu&s;tre, and Society and the Influence of pure and undefiled Re|ligion, appear with &s;uperior Advantage, it mu&s;t be in &s;uch A&s;&s;emblies as <HI>this,</HI> collected for the Purpo&s;es of pious Benevolence and Compa&s;&s;ion, in Behalf of the afflicted Part of our own Species.</P>
<P>AND if ever <HI>Scenes of Wretchedne&s;s and Mi&s;ery</HI> ought to move the Heart, and engage the&s;e amiable Di&s;po&s;i|tions, the deep and deplorable Di&s;tre&s;s of the Objects now under Con&s;ideration, will certainly produce that de&s;irable Effect, and to a Degree an&s;werable to the large Supplies that are ab&s;olutely requi&s;ite in a Ca&s;e &s;o very exten&s;ive.</P>
<P>REFLECT, with Attention, upon that beautiful, and, in the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e, very appo&s;ite Parable of the hard|hearted rich Man, and the afflicted <HI>Lazarus,</HI> drawn by the <HI>compa&s;&s;ionate Saviour</HI> of Mankind, to excite Bene|volence and Pity, by repre&s;enting the different Fate and Condition of the uncharitable <HI>Rich,</HI> and the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed <HI>Poor,</HI> in this World, and in the next.</P>
<P>THERE <HI>was a certain rich Man</HI> who fared <HI>&s;umptu|ou&s;ly every Day</HI>; and there was <HI>a certain Beggar, named Lazarus,</HI> which was <HI>laid at</HI> the rich Man's Gate, <HI>full of Sores,</HI> &mdash; unpitied, unrelieved!&mdash; <HI>Moreover the</HI> Dogs <HI>came and licked his Sores.</HI> &mdash; View the awful Scene that follows, where the unmerciful rich Man, <HI>lifting up his Eyes,</HI> in Hell, <HI>being in</HI> Torment, in vain &s;ollicits for that Mercy and Relief, which he, in the Day of his

<HI>Pro&s;perity,</HI> had cruelly denied to his afflicted Brother; <HI>Son,</HI> &s;ays the holy Patriarch whom he importuned for a <HI>Drop of Water to cool his Tongue,</HI> REMEMBER <HI>that thou in thy Life-time received&s;t thy good Things, and likewi&s;e</HI> Lazarus <HI>his evil Things; but now he is com|forted, and thou art tormented</HI>!</P>
<P>BUT ob&s;erve, that in the Sen&s;e of the Go&s;pel, who|ever has &s;ufficient Ability to relieve his &s;ick and de&s;titute Brother, and does it not, that uncharitable Per&s;on is, in truth, the <HI>rich Man</HI> intended by the Parable.</P>
<P>CARRY on your Thoughts then to that <HI>awful Day,</HI> when you al&s;o mu&s;t appear in Judgment; and, if your pre&s;ent Benevolence does not prevent it, mu&s;t undergo the <HI>&s;ame</HI> &s;ad Doom, when your tremendous Judge &s;hall &s;ay, and what is the &s;tinging Aggravation, your <HI>own Con&s;cience</HI> &s;ay, (as the Prophet of old to the guilty Prince) &mdash;<HI>Thou art the Man</HI>!</P>
<P>BUT, Brethren, we hope better Things of you, even &s;uch as accompany Salvation; and that with <HI>chearful</HI> Hearts, and very <HI>liberal</HI> Hands, you will extend your much wanted Beneficence, proportioned in &s;ome Mea|&s;ure to the prodigious Di&s;tre&s;s of the prodigious Num|bers that &s;tand in need of this compa&s;&s;ionate Relief.</P>
<P>HAVE you, your&s;elves, undergone this <HI>loath&s;ome,</HI> and <HI>grievous</HI> Di&s;ea&s;e? have you &s;een your Friends or Children under it, a&s;&s;i&s;ted with all the Advantages of affectionate Help, and &s;kilful Art?
