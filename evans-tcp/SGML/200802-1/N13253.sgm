<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE following account, is one of the mo&s;t &s;hocking. A brief nar|rative of the life of one, who, before he was twenty years of age, could delibe|rately murder a family, for the &s;ake of plundering the hou&s;e, it is apprehended, may be of &s;ome &s;ervice to mankind. When they con&s;ider the fearful end of one, brought up in profanene&s;s, neglect of public wor&s;hip, without pious in|&s;truction or learning, profaning GOD's &s;abbaths, and bla&s;pheming his name; which the wretched malefactor repre|&s;ents as having been very much his ca&s;e. The narrative is penned from the cri|minal's mouth, though not always ex|actly in his own words. Some moral re|flections are inter&s;per&s;ed.</P>

<HEAD>A BRIEF NARRATIVE, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>AS they tell me, I was born at New-Milford, the 25th of October, 1760, and lived with my parents until I was about nine years of age. By this time, I was become quite expert in u&s;ing bad lan|guage, having been accu&s;tomed to profanene&s;s, from the time I was capable of forming articulate &s;ounds. How early was the infernal dialect become habitual! I was then &s;ent to live with Mr. Nathan Hawley, where I abode about two years and an half. Here I had but little opportunity of going to &s;chool, and that which I had, was not mo&s;t carefully improved; but very little proficiency was made in learning to read. When about eleven years old, as near as I can recol|lect, I ran away from Mr. Hawley's, under pretence of having been abu&s;ed: But there I began to pilfer, by &s;tealing green corn, which was, (if I rightly re|member) the beginning of that infamous practice, which led me on to the mo&s;t horrid crimes ever com|mitted. I then went to my father's hou&s;e, and lived there about one year. Then I was &s;ent to live with one Mr. Ebenezer Bo&s;twick, where I continued part of one &s;ummer; but being unea&s;y, would live there no longer, and returned to my father, with whom I lived till the following &s;pring, when I returned to Mr. Bo&s;twick's. Pre&s;ently, I grew very unea&s;y, imagining my&s;elf treated with too much &s;everity. Here, my temper, naturally pa&s;&s;ionate, frequently vented it&s;elf in perver&s;e language, or was manife&s;ted by a &s;ullen dumbne&s;s. In&s;omuch, that when a
<PB N="6" REF="016756_0004_0F9DF23DC4C728E8">
plough boy, I would frequently either not &s;peak at all, or u&s;e &s;uch language as is not fit to be repeated. Being now about twelve years of age, I could not read; had &s;carce ever been in a place of public wor|&s;hips; nor always, where family wor&s;hip was, attend|ed. That parents coun&s;el's, warnings, and &s;olemn admonitions may come with weight on children's minds, family prayer and public wor&s;hip are of great importance.</P>
<P>Here I was guilty of pillaging a neighbour's gar|den, &s;tole &s;ome water-melons, &amp;c. However &s;mall the&s;e crimes may appear to &s;ome, yet, when viewed in the light of eternity, and as leading to the mo&s;t dreadful enormities, they mu&s;t appear awfully fear|ful.</P>
<P>During this year, my time was &s;pent in going to one place to live, and then to another, di&s;quieted, like the troubled &s;ea, which cannot re&s;t.</P>
<P>When I was about thirteen years old, I was &s;ent to live at another place, and not long after, was let out to Mr. Daniel Tyrrell; from who&s;e &s;on, I pretty &s;oon &s;tole &s;ome money. I was detected, reproved, admoni&s;hed, and warned of my danger, by &s;ome who reminded me of the notorious Fra<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">ie<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">, and his fearful end, &s;imilar to which they feared mine would be. I was corrected as well as warned, and my father in|formed, and I was &s;ent to him. With him I conti|nued till the &s;pring following, when I went to live with Mr. Aaron Hitchcock, where I learned to read, though but poorly. Contrary to orders, I rode away his hor&s;e, which being di&s;covered, he threatened to puni&s;h me. Upon this, I &s;tole a &s;mall matter of mo|ney and a &s;ilk handkerchief, and run away. Finding
<PB N="7" REF="016756_0005_0F9DF23E71623E10">
that I was pur&s;ued, I concealed my&s;elf by the way|&s;ide, and thought within my&s;elf, when the two men in pur&s;uit of me rode by, "I loved to &s;ee the devils ride. They are got fooled once<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The&s;e are his very words, which, he &s;ays, expre&s;s his mind, and which he then conceived.</NOTE>." I had once be|fore run away from the &s;ame man, with whom, it had been well for me, if I had lived. I was carried back the next day, and corrected. There I was to have lived 'till I was &s;ixteen; but being di&s;contented, I went again to my father's, being now about fourteen.</P>
<P>The next winter my father bound me to Mr. John Stillwell, to live with him till I was of age. With him I lived more than a year. While I lived here, I once laid a plan to murder Mr. Stillwell, and how to conceal it, in the following manner: When we were in the field, drawing logs, and Mr. Stillwell was &s;tooping down to put the chain round the log, I took up the ax to knock him on the head, and then de|&s;igned to draw the log over him, tear him to pieces, and &s;o conceal the murdering of him. But my heart then failed me, not being yet &s;o hardened in &s;in, as to carry into execution my horrid plan, and perpetrate the &s;hocking crime. It is a maxim, as old as antient Rome, That no man becomes a devil in a minute. Things of trifling value I &s;tole here, &s;uch as eggs, hens, potatoes, &amp;c. and &s;old them to per&s;ons near where I then lived, which was at Pitts-Town. The &s;ummer following, I &s;tole Mr. Stillwell's hor&s;e, and ran away. Before I got to Stockbridge, I turned up the hor&s;e; and, about a month after, went home to my father, continuing the wretched practice of pilfer|ing
<PB N="8" REF="016756_0006_0F9DF23F4F4F6B18">
green corn, water-melons, and the like, leading a mo&s;t carele&s;s, &s;tupid life, neither reading, praying, or attending any public wor&s;hip. Indeed, I had now almo&s;t forgot that which I once learnt, as to reading.</P>
<P>The winter following, I enli&s;ted for three years, in Col. Brewers regiment, belonging to the State of Ma&s;|&s;achu&s;etts; went to Ticonderoga, March 1777; tar|ried there till the fort was evacuated by our troops, retreated with our forces; was at the battle of Ho|bartown; then retreated to Sillwater. Here, being one day enraged at a &s;oldier, in my pa&s;&s;ion, I threw a club at him, which mi&s;&s;ing him, wounded an officer, and I was puni&s;hed. When our army, after Gene|ral Burgoyne's &s;urrender, came down to Albany, I was there vi&s;ited with &s;ore &s;ickne&s;s; then went home upon a furlough for 12 days, and, by imprudence, got a very &s;evere relap&s;e.</P>
<P>Early the next &s;pring, I went to Danbury&punc; where I kept guard two months; during which, I &s;tole hens, gee&s;e, Continental rum and wine. From thence I went to Valley-Forge, and joined the army; but on the road &s;tole &s;ome &s;ugar; was at the battle at Mon|mouth; remained with the army till General Patter|&s;on's brigade, to which I belonged, came to Wood|bury, the October following. There I got a pa&s;s for one day, to go and &s;ee my brother, and was then to rejoin the army. But never joined that brigade again. I went to my brother's, and then to my father's, and on the road &s;tole a pair of &s;tockings. Then went and lived at four different places in Cornwall at Canaan, in le&s;s than four months, di&s;contented at each, for &s;ome rea&s;on or other. I was then hired by a man in Nobletown, to go into the &s;ervice for nine
<PB N="9" REF="016756_0007_0F9DF240AF368858">
months, and went to Albany and joined Capt. Bovit's company. As the man that hired me, refu&s;ed to pay part of what he promi&s;ed, I attempted to return to my father; but was pur&s;ued, overtook, and carried back&mdash;joined the regiment, (Col. Ran&s;&s;elaers.) From Albany went with a party to the German Flatts, and remained there till about October, 1779. During this campaign, I &s;tole one pair of bra&s;s &s;hoe-buckles from a &s;oldier; a piece of linen cloth from one of the inhabitants; a powder horn, powder, bullet-pouch, and bullets, from a &s;oldier. Being one day &s;ent out upon a &s;cout, with &s;ome others, we plundered an hou&s;e, by leave of the officer; and I privately, with|out leave, &s;et it on fire.</P>
<P>Having obtained a furlough of twelve days to go home, on the road &s;tole a pair of &s;ilver &s;hoe-buckles; between Sheffield and Canaan &s;tole an hor&s;e, and rode it almo&s;t home. On the way I &s;tole two &s;hirts, one frock, and a piece of linen cloth, at different places. In the beginning of November, went to live in New-York State; &s;tole one Continental dollar. Returned, and about the end of that month, went to live at Mr. Caleb Mallery's.</P>
<P>He took me in out of pity and compa&s;&s;ion, and engaged to let me have &s;ome cloathing, of which I &s;tood in &s;pecial need, and for which I made the mo&s;t vile, ungrateful, and dete&s;table returns, as the &s;equel of this tragical &s;tory will tell.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t at the clo&s;e of the month of January, 1780, about five or &s;ix days before my perpetrating the blacke&s;t crimes that ever mortals committed, I deter|mined upon the murder of Mr. Mallory and his fa|mily, the fir&s;t opportunity; and this, merely, for the
<PB N="10" REF="016756_0008_0F9DF2418217CC10">
&s;ake of plundering his hou&s;e; without the lea&s;t pro|vocation, or prejudice again&s;t any of them. The fa|mily in which I now lived con&s;i&s;ted of Mr. Mallery, Mrs. Mallery, a daughter in law, a daughter, and three grand children.</P>
<P>I was haunted and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with the thoughts of murder, from the time of my fir&s;t entertaining them, both day and night. Nor could I get rid of them, even when I attempted to do it.&mdash;Mr. Mallery's own daughter being a taylore&s;s, went out to work: her &s;i&s;ter in law &s;pake of going to pay a vi&s;it, and tarry|ing all night: which was the time I fixed upon to execute my bloody, land-defiling, &s;oul-ruining, and heaven-daring plan. With great impatience I waited for, and endeavoured to ha&s;ten the daughter in law to pay her vi&s;it, while the other daughter was ab&s;ent. On the 3d of February, &s;he went away accordingly, and tarried that night&mdash;A night big with uncommon horror. My heart trembles and is moved out of its place, at the relation of this mo&s;t tremendous, cruel, bloody, and amazing &s;cene.&mdash;Mr. Mallery and his wife with one of the children, went to bed in the &s;ame room&mdash;he lying in one bed, and the other two in the other. Upon this, I took a piece of cloth and made me a knap&s;ack: and then went to plundering the daughter in law's room, &s;earching for &s;ome hard mo|ney, which, I under&s;tood &s;he had, but could not find it. After putting &s;ome things into my knap&s;ack; with the candle in one had and the &s;wingle in the o|ther, I went into the room where Mr. Mallery, his wife and one grand child lay a&s;leep. Fir&s;t I &s;mote him with my might once or twice on his head; upon this Mrs. Mallery awaking attempted to ri&s;e up; I
<PB N="11" REF="016756_0009_0F9DF24234FCF4E8">
turned and &s;truck her one or two blows. Mr. Mal|lery then &s;prung up; I &s;truck immediately at him; but he partly warded off the blow with his arm, and then &s;truck the candle out of my hand; I then pu&s;h|ed him back, and down upon the bed, belabouring him with the club&mdash;He a&s;ked me who I was? what I meant? and &s;aid, tell me what you do it for? Then called to his wife to come and help him repeatedly. Who can ab&s;tain from tears, while relating the&s;e things! Mrs. Mallery made no an&s;wer, only &s;hrieks, cries, and doleful lamentations. Having for &s;ome time &s;mote Mr. Mallery and pounded him, the &s;wingle &s;plit. Upon this, I catched a gun which &s;tood behind the door, and with this in&s;trument of death, proceeded &s;till to &s;mite him: I then turned again, and did the &s;ame to Mrs. Mallery, and continued &s;triking till &s;he lay &s;till as well as he.</P>
<P>The child, in bed with its grand mother, was &s;even years and eight months old. The&s;e cruel blows and piercing cries awoke the tender babe, in &s;hocking &s;ur|prize, even while I was killing her grand father; and &s;tarting up &s;he a&s;ks, her dear but wounded grand mother, what is the matter. She cried out bitterly; &s;he called out for me, or to me, by the name, the plea|&s;ant child u&s;ed to call me, &s;aying, <HI>Mr. Nicholas</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Nicholas was the name by which he was called in that family: and Mr. Nicholas by the child.</NOTE>. But I continued paying on; feeling no remor&s;e at killing my aged patrons and benefactors. For the child, I &s;eemed to feel, &s;ome &s;mall relentings, without remitting in the lea&s;t, my execrable exertions. This anger was cur&s;ed, for it was mo&s;t barbarous and cruel.
<PB N="12" REF="016756_0010_0F9DF2430F75FE18">
Probably this child was at this time mortally wound|ed; for &s;he gave a few terrible &s;hrieks, which (one would think) were enough to pierce the harde&s;t heart, and reach the center of the mo&s;t obdurate &s;inner's &s;oul: And then &s;he lay &s;till, &s;ighing and groaning in the mo&s;t affecting manner.</P>
<P>The room being now be&s;meared with blood, and filled with horrendous groans: I went into the other room, lighted the candle, and pre&s;ently returned to this room, in which expiring groan an&s;wered to groan. Nor was Pharaoh's heart harder than mine For a|mid&s;t the&s;e dying groans and &s;treaming blood, I looked for the key to open the che&s;t where the mo|ney lay; but could not find it. Then I went, got a pe&s;tle and broke open the che&s;t. By this time both Mr. Mallery and his wife began to &s;truggle&mdash;I ma&s;h|ed his head all to pieces with this in&s;trument: And &s;he ri&s;ing partly up in the bed, I &s;mote her al&s;o with the pe&s;tle on her head, &s;everal times, and &s;he tumbled behind the bed. Before this I &s;aw her face &s;woln to twice its common bigne&s;s, disfigured with wounds, and covered with gore and &s;treaming blood.</P>
<P>To an heart not pa&s;t all feeling what could have been more &s;hocking! But how unmoved was I, who now &s;et my&s;elf to &s;earching for the money of the dead. Having found a con&s;iderable &s;um of paper currency, and &s;ome &s;olid coin; and &s;earched among the papers for more, &s;cattering them about. I put on &s;ome of the dying man's clothes:&mdash;plundering the room in which tho&s;e &s;till groaning per&s;ons, in the angui&s;h of death, then were lying. Then, I went into a room where the two other grand children lay. The&s;e were waked up by the preceding blows or
<PB N="13" REF="016756_0011_0F9DF243A90FCF70">
cries, and a&s;ked for their clothes to get up. I told them to lye down, and go to &s;leep for it was not morning. They cried and a&s;ked what was the mat|ter with their grand mother? I an&s;wered, &s;he was &s;ick. They a&s;ked again, What made her make &s;uch a noi&s;e? And then they lay down, &s;obbing<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The&s;e two children were, one about &s;ix, the other a|bout four years old.</NOTE>. I then plundered the hou&s;e of &s;undry articles. After this, I &s;et a fire in the milk room, another in the outward room, and another up chamber, in the flax and tow. Seeing the hou&s;e well on fire, and the outward room all filled with blaze, I &s;et off for Blue Swamp, about eight miles from thence. But for want of a track in the &s;now, was obliged to go about twelve miles to get there. From thence I purpo&s;ed for Ball Town. Arrived at Blue Swamp, about nine o'clock, A. M. But no &s;ooner had I fini&s;hed the dreadful &s;cene of murder, than fear attacked me&mdash;Fleeing from the burning hou&s;e and cro&s;&s;ing a bridge near by, I was afraid it would break under me, and kill me.&mdash;After I got to Blue Swamp (&s;trange to relate) I tarried there from Friday morning till the next Wedne&s;day afternoon: Sometimes I felt alarmed and determined immediately to flee with all po&s;&s;ible &s;peed: And in a few moments would &s;ink into a &s;tate of the utmo&s;t carele&s;&s;ne&s;s and remi&s;&s;ne&s;s. Notwith&s;tanding repeat|ed re&s;olutions, one thing and another would inter|vene, and I could not go. The next day after I got to Blue Swamp, we heard of the conflagration. I concluded, they would think that I was burnt up, and was left to that &s;tupidity, great part of the time,
<PB N="14" REF="016756_0012_0F9DF246578817F8">
as not to imagine they would hear of me. Some|times, I apprehended, I &s;hould be immediately taken, then &s;unk into the greate&s;t &s;ecurity. On Wedne&s;day afternoon, I &s;et off and went to Cornwall, where I put up for that night; when I was pur&s;ued and ta|ken in bed. Upon this I confe&s;&s;ed the murder; though I fal&s;ified the truth as to my having an ac|complice. For I &s;olemnly declare, that no per&s;on living knew any thing about my murderous de&s;ign, or had the lea&s;t hand in it, either mediately or immediately, but my&s;elf&mdash;I undertook and perpetrated it alone, a|mazing, and unheard of as it is.</P>
<P>After being &s;ent to gaol, and even before I was committed, I confe&s;&s;ed the fal&s;ehood, re&s;pecting my &s;aying, that I had an accomplice. On the 25th of April, I was arraigned before the honorable &s;uperior court of this State, and plead guilty to the indict|ment of murder, laid in again&s;t me.</P>
<P>On the 27th, &s;entence of death was publicly pro|nounced; and, upon the eighth of May next, I am to be executed. O that others may take warning by my dreadful example and fearful end! And avoid tho&s;e &s;ins which I have committed, and which by a &s;eries of wickedne&s;s have led me on to the mo&s;t aw|ful crimes that ever were perpetrated in this land, or perhaps any other; and for which I mu&s;t (mo&s;t ju&s;tly) &s;uffer a violent death, and I greatly fear, ever|la&s;ting burning, horror and de&s;pair.</P>
