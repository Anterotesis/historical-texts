<HEAD>A LETTER TO A FRIEND, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN An&s;wer to your Reque&s;t, I have &s;ent you my Sentiments upon the late Pamphlet, entituled, <HI>A Di&s;cour&s;e on the Preparation of the Bo|dy for the</HI> SMALL-POX, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> I had re&s;olved at fir&s;t to confine my|&s;elf to what had been &s;aid in our News-papers; but upon a Review, I found nothing touched upon would give you the Satisfaction I conceived you might expect; the Foibles and little Vanities of the Author, which I found chiefly in&s;i&s;ted on in tho&s;e Papers, were not of that Con&s;equence, as the Methods propos'd by the Author, for &s;ecuring Mankind from the dire Effects of that malignant Di&s;ea&s;e: I re&s;olved therefore to take an im|partial View of the whole, with that Candour and Clearne&s;s (the Bounds of a Letter would allow me, in a Matter of &s;uch Importance) which in a cur&s;ory Manner, you'll find in the following Lines.</P>
<P>DISCOURSE, Page 8. <HI>My principal De&s;ign is, to offer &s;ome Things con|cerning the Preparation of the Body, and the Manner of receiving the In|fection; which, from any Thing I have yet &s;een, appears to me, never to have been con&s;ider'd with that Attention the Importance of the Subject de|&s;erves.</HI></P>
<P>REMARK. This Charge again&s;t the Learned of the Faculty, upon due Con&s;ideration, will be found a Mi&s;take in our Author him&s;elf, for want of Attention to the preparatory Methods, previou&s;ly to be con&s;idered; which cannot be fixed upon, before the State and Condition of the Humours of the Body is known, which upon the fir&s;t Inva&s;ion of the Di&s;ea&s;e, is to be

collected from the Di&s;po&s;ition of the Fever ari&s;ing from thence; and as it is different in different Subjects,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">General Rules of Diet, without Regard to particular Con&s;titutions, are ab&s;urd. <HI>Arbuthnot,</HI> &s;econd Edit. Fol. 218.</NOTE> no general &s;tated Methods for preparing the Body, previous to the Inva&s;ion of the Di&s;ea&s;e, can promi&s;e any real Advantage to the Patient: And if the Gentleman will con&s;ider the Writings of learned and experienced Phy&s;icians, he will find, they have treated this Subject, as the Nature of the Ca&s;e nece&s;&s;arily indicates, not only with Attention, but with a &s;uperior Judgment, above the Reach of tho&s;e, who&s;e natural Genius, or perhaps Opportunities of receiving In&s;truc|tion in the Art of Healing, may not render them capable of under&s;tanding, much le&s;s able to pre&s;cribe Precepts, or Rules of Practice in a Science, which as it is the mo&s;t u&s;eful to Mankind, &s;o is it the mo&s;t worthy to be e&s;teemed before all others; and therefore not to be pro&s;tituted to the vain Chimeras of a doubtful Hypothe&s;is.</P>
<P>DISCOURSE, Page 10. <HI>It looks inflamed and &s;izy, exactly like the Blood of a Per&s;on in a Pleuri&s;y, or any other inflammatory Di&s;order; &s;o nearly allied are the Symptoms of this contagious Fever, to that of a &s;imple in|flammatory One.</HI></P>
<P>REMARK. By our Author's Manner of here expre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf, one would be led to imagine he took a Pleuri&s;y to be a &s;imple inflammatory Di&s;|ea&s;e; but this, perhaps, may be for want of Attention to the antecedent Word <HI>Pleuri&s;y,</HI> otherwi&s;e it would repre&s;ent the Author guilty of a capital Mi|&s;take, in his Theory of Di&s;ea&s;es: For a Pleuri&s;y has always been looked upon, and treated by the Learned of the Faculty, as an Inflammation of the wor&s;t Kind: But our Author takes the Effect for the Cau&s;e, when he tells us (Page 10. Line 14.) <HI>When the Di&s;ea&s;e is violent, the dangerous Ap|pearances are all of the gangrenous Kind, ari&s;ing from a putrid Di&s;&s;olution of the Blood.</HI> What putrid Di&s;&s;olution of the Blood there can be in a va|riolous Fever, before the Appearance of the gangrenous State of the Pu|&s;tules, cannot be ea&s;ily apprehended; for a variolous Fever is not ranged by Phy&s;icians among the Number of putrid Fevers, but among tho&s;e of the inflammatory Kind; and notwith&s;tanding the vi&s;ible Putrefaction occa&s;ion|ed by the critical Di&s;charge of the Pu&s;tules, which determines the Inflam|mation to the Skin, and membranous Coverings of the Throat and <HI>Vi&s;ce|ra;</HI> yet the Putrefaction attending the Di&s;ea&s;e, is evidently the Con&s;e|quence of the gangrenous Appearances, and cannot be &s;aid to take its Ri&s;e from a putrid Di&s;&s;olution of the Blood, <HI>a Priori.</HI></P>
<P>DISCOURSE, Page 11. <HI>Putrefaction is always occa&s;ion'd by too much Heat.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="006697_0004_1029AB0DC9A24730">
REMARK. It is an undoubted Mi&s;take, to &s;uppo&s;e Putrefaction is al|ways occa&s;ioned by too much Heat, &s;ince it is known that Mortifications from a Defect of natural Heat, in low di&s;pirited Ca&s;es, have produced the highe&s;t Degree of Putrefaction. In a Hi&s;tory of the Plague, written by a Citizen of <HI>London,</HI> in the Year 1665, we are told, that it was a com|mon Thing to &s;ee Per&s;ons drop down dead in the Streets, and in their Fa|milies, without any previous Complaint, or Appearance of a Fever at|tending them, yet upon viewing their Bodies after Death, or even when they were yet expiring, there appeared the highe&s;t Degree of Rottenne&s;s and Putrefaction vi&s;ible upon them: And it is &s;ufficiently known, that in a Deficiency of animal Heat, after large Evacuations in the Drop&s;y, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> the wor&s;t Symptoms of a Gangrene, and a Putrefaction of both Solids and Fluids, have appeared: And it is al&s;o the Opinion of eminent Phy|&s;icians, that tho&s;e fatal Symptoms of Putrefaction attending the Plague, do ari&s;e from a Deficiency of animal Heat, being extingui&s;hed by the delete|rious Mia&s;ms of the Di&s;ea&s;e, by which the Motion of the Blood is retard|ed, and the Humours do con&s;equently putrify.</P>
<P>DISCOURSE, Page 11. Line 26. <HI>But Milk, and all Vegetables by Heat turn acid, which is directly oppo&s;ite to Putrefaction.</HI></P>
<P>Page 12. Line 6. <HI>Blood, prepared chiefly from a &s;ub-acid vegetable, or Milk Diet, mu&s;t be in general that State of the Body which is be&s;t fitted to receive an inflammatory Di&s;temper.</HI></P>
<P>REMARK. It is a Mi&s;take, to &s;uppo&s;e Milk and vegetable Diet is always oppo&s;ite to Putrefaction, for it is known to Phy&s;icians,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Arbuthnot's E&s;&s;ay on Aliments,</HI> Chap. v. Sect. 16.</NOTE> that Milk, but e&s;pecially vegetable Diet, will turn to Putrefaction, and by a faulty Dige&s;tion of the Stomach, will be converted into an acid Acrimony, the immediate Cau&s;e of Head-achs, Deliriums, Pleuri&s;ies, Peripneumonies, Ophthalmies, Tormina's of the Stomach and Bowels, and the wor&s;t Kinds of inflammatory Di&s;orders; from hence may prove as unfit a Preparative for receiving the Infection of the SMALL-POX, as Food of either Fi&s;h or Fle&s;h; it is no ea&s;y Ta&s;k for the mo&s;t accurate Phy&s;ician, to &s;ay, what Sort of Food or Medicine is the mo&s;t proper Preparative for receiving the SMALL-POX, without previou&s;ly knowing the true State of the Humours in the human Body:<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Idem, Chap. iv. Sect. 1.</NOTE> The Blood in Health, from the many Ob&s;erva|tions made upon it, has no perceivable Alkaly or Acid to be found in it; &s;o that Food or Medicine, which may di&s;po&s;e the Humours of the Body to an ace&s;cent State, which Milk and vegetable Diet may po&s;&s;ibly do, mu&s;t in Pro|portion di&s;po&s;e the Humours of the Body to &s;omething contrary to Health,
<PB N="6" REF="006697_0005_1029AB1889B0FCD0">
or what may be called morbid, and unfit to undergo the Severity of a malignant Di&s;ea&s;e, of which Kind the SMALL-POX is known to be; and al&s;o to pre&s;cribe a low, &s;pare and refrigerating Diet, as herein recommended, below what the Patient had been accu&s;tomed to, under a regular Way of living, free from any known Di&s;order attending the human Frame, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily &s;ubject the Body to new and uncertain Changes; the Mo|mentum of the Blood (by &s;ub&s;tracting the accu&s;tomed Aliment) will here|by be reduced below the nece&s;&s;ary Standard of Health: From hence the animal Secretions will become irregular and imperfect; and tho&s;e Secre|tions, which otherwi&s;e would have been made at the cuticular Glands and Extremities, will be made nigher the Heart, and Fountain of animal Life: From hence the &s;en&s;ible and in&s;en&s;ible Per&s;piration, the gentle Breathings and benign Sweats, greatly conducive to the carrying off the variolous Ef|fluvia, will be le&s;&s;ened, if not wholly &s;uppre&s;s'd: Hence the Mia&s;mata, for want of the nece&s;&s;ary Impetus of the circulating Fluids, will be inverted: And from hence it is tho&s;e dire Symptoms afflicting the Brain and vital Parts do nece&s;&s;arily ari&s;e, which when attended with an acid Acrimony, the common Ca&s;e of Children and young Per&s;ons, do frequently terminate in Inflammations, Gangrenes, putrid Fevers, Convul&s;ions, Deliquiums, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which often re&s;i&s;t the mo&s;t powerful Remedies: Alexipharmacs, and the warm Expellers u&s;ed to throw the variolous Di&s;ea&s;e on the cuticular Glands, finding no Pa&s;&s;age through their excretory Ducts, which are now become dry, rigid and &s;hut up, &s;erve only to heighten the Inflammation and threa|tening Symptoms: To attempt to reduce the&s;e Di&s;orders by Bleeding or any other Evacuation, in this low State of the circulating Fluids, is adding Strength to the Di&s;ea&s;e, and expo&s;ing the Life of the Patient to the ut|mo&s;t Danger; which fatal Con&s;equences, from a low milk&mdash;and e&s;pecially vegetable Diet, have been ob&s;erved to happen in <HI>Europe,</HI> as well as in the Colonies of <HI>North America.</HI></P>
<P>DISCOURSE, Page 14. <HI>It would be of the greate&s;t Benefit to Mankind to find out a &s;pecifick Medicine which would either expel it entirely, or alter it &s;o, as to render it quite innocent, or mitigate its malignant Quality.</HI></P>
<P>Page 15. <HI>But the Trial of an ea&s;y operating antimonial and mercurial Medicine as a Preparative, can be of no Danger.</HI></P>
<P>REMARK. That excellent Phy&s;ician,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Dr. <HI>Mead's Di&s;cour&s;e on the Small-Pox,</HI> Page 58</NOTE> Dr. <HI>Mead,</HI> has &s;ufficiently ex|pos'd the Folly of hunting after Specificks, the common Amu&s;ements of Ignorance, or Tricks of low Craft, to draw Pence out of the Pockets of the unthinking Populace, who generally admire tho&s;e mo&s;t who have the Art of deceiving them be&s;t. To receive a Medicine as a &s;pecifick Pre|parative, Alterative, or Expeller, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in a Ca&s;e where Life is at Stake,

from the bare Conjecture of one Per&s;on only, e&s;pecially one, who we have Rea&s;on to think has been deceived, in his high Opinion of a milk and vegetable Diet, which he recommends as the mo&s;t beneficial Prepa|rative, in receiving the Infection of the SMALL-POX, would be as Idle as to take a Journey to the Moon, becau&s;e certain A&s;tronomers do conceit it is inhabited, and which upon Trial may prove of as little Advantage to the Healths of Mankind, as the many No&s;trums, and Specificks, for the Cure of Cancers, and other extraordinary Di&s;ea&s;es, which we daily hear pretended to, by boa&s;ting Quacks, and bold undertaking Mountebanks: As to the Di&s;covery of the Specifick here pretended to, e&s;pecially the <HI>Mer|curius Dulcis;</HI> it has of a long Date been approved of as a beneficial Me|dicine in the SMALL-POX, by the excellent <HI>Ludovicus, Etmuller,</HI> and o|thers; which al&s;o has been long and repeatedly made u&s;e of in this Ca&s;e, in <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> with the Addition of an antimonial Preparation; and tho' it may be allowed the Place of a good Preparative (by clean&s;ing the <HI>Vi&s;ce|ra</HI> and Organs of Secretion) being given immediately before the variolous Fever appears, or in the Manner <HI>Ludovicus</HI> advi&s;es, <HI>i. e.</HI> &s;o as to open the Body with a Stool or two, upon the fir&s;t Inva&s;ion of the Di&s;ea&s;e, yet the benign Effects of this Medicine, will not admit of the high Character of a Specifick, by performing the mighty Feats our Author is led to imagine; or will it de&s;erve the Pains of writing a Di&s;cour&s;e on purpo&s;e to recom|mend the U&s;e of it, as a &s;pecifick Medicine in the SMALL-POX, without &s;ome other more intere&s;ting Con&s;ideration, which, perhaps, might have been in our Author's View.</P>
<P>DISCOURSE, Page 16. <HI>I gave them a Fortnight's Preparation in the Manner afore&s;aid, and then they came freely into the Room where the others were. Two of them took the Di&s;ea&s;e, yet in the mo&s;t moderate Manner, &s;o as never to lie by an Hour with it: But the Third could not catch it at all, notwith&s;tanding he &s;lept in the Bed with his Brothers and Si&s;ters, with the</HI> SMALL-POX <HI>upon them.</HI></P>
<P>REMARK. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> no uncommon Ca&s;e, where there are &s;everal Per&s;ons in a Family to have the SMALL-POX, to &s;ee them differently handled by the Di&s;ea&s;e, &s;o that &s;ome will labour under the mo&s;t &s;evere Symptoms, when others will either have the Di&s;ea&s;e very favourably, or perhaps no Appearance of the Di&s;ea&s;e at all, except a &s;mall Fever, and this very of|ten &s;carce perceivable: Nor is it an unu&s;ual Thing, where a malignant Di&s;ea&s;e is epidemical, to &s;ee Per&s;ons who are fir&s;t taken ill of the Di&s;ea&s;e, in a Family,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. <HI>Sydenham's</HI> Works, 7th Edit.

at its fir&s;t Appearance, have had it very lightly, and &s;ome not at all, at lea&s;t not to be perceived: And this, any one who has read the Hi&s;tory of the Plague in <HI>London,</HI> of the Year 1665; or Dr. <HI>Sydenham,</HI> on the SMALL-POX; or has had the Opportunity of making the lea&s;t Ob&s;ervation him&s;elf, will find a Truth not to be di&s;puted. And therefore the Ca&s;e of the Family which the Author of the <HI>Di&s;cour&s;e</HI> relates, can be no certain Proof of the beneficial Effects of the&s;e preparatory Medicines, or Methods he had made u&s;e of, in the Ca&s;es he is plea&s;ed to lay before us.</P>
<P>DISCOURSE, Page 17. <HI>The more hot and putre&s;cent the Blood is, the more ten&s;e and active the Ve&s;&s;els are, the apter they will be to imbibe any thing applied to them; an In&s;tance of this we &s;ee in acute Fevers, where that is the State of the Blood and Ve&s;&s;els; let a Per&s;on in this Condition drink as much as he will, the Moi&s;ture applied to the Ve&s;&s;els of the Mouth and Throat is &s;ucked up, and they quickly again feel parched and dry, which evidently &s;hews this Power of Ab&s;orption in the Ve&s;&s;els.</HI></P>
<P>REMARK. It is an Ab&s;urdity &s;carce reconcileable with Common Sen&s;e, to attribute the Thir&s;t and Dryne&s;s of the Mouth and Throat, in ardent Fe|vers, to the Ab&s;orption of the Ve&s;&s;els, when it is vi&s;ibly owing to a very contrary Cau&s;e; <HI>i. e.</HI> the Ob&s;truction of the excretory Ducts of the &s;ali|val and &s;ublingual Glands, and Ve&s;&s;els of the Mouth and Throat, being &s;hut up with a dry and vi&s;cid Lymph, the Con&s;equence of an ardent Fe|ver; in which Ca&s;e, the Liquids taken into the Mouth, in&s;tead of our Author's imagined Ab&s;orption, being rarified by the Heat and Dryne&s;s of the Parts, fly off in a Vapour, without the Po&s;&s;ibility of finding Admit|tance into the Pores or inhalent Ve&s;&s;els, which are now entirely &s;hut up; from hence the Mouth and Throat nece&s;&s;arily feel parched and dry, &s;o that we might with as much Propriety of Rea&s;on and Philo&s;ophy, &s;ay, That a dried Chip, who&s;e Pores and Surface were filled and &s;mear'd over with a tough and adhe&s;ive Glew, would therefore &s;uck up more Water into its Pores and bibulous Tubes, than a Chip of the &s;ame Kind would do, who&s;e Surface was naked, and its Pores open and free from any foreign Incumbrance.</P>
<P>DISCOURSE, Page 22. <HI>Should the Cri&s;is be principally determined towards the Arm, where the Inoculation was performed, the vital Parts will be in more Danger of partaking of it, than if it was determined towards the Legs and Feet,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>REMARK. This, upon a due Con&s;ideration of the Ca&s;e here propo&s;ed, will appear a Mi&s;take; for it is known to Phy&s;icians and Men acquainted

with the Art of Healing, that I&s;&s;ues, Cupping-Gla&s;&s;es, Scarifications, Bli|&s;ters, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> applied to the Arm, are frequently made u&s;e of to determine Pains, Inflammations and Di&s;orders of the Head, to the Inflammation brought on by their Application to that Part; and it is equally rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e, that the Scarifications made on the Arm, in the Ca&s;e of Ino|culation, will have the &s;ame Effect; and that the Derivation of the variolous Symptoms u&s;ually affecting the Head, will by this Means be thrown on a le&s;s noble Part, and as a depending Part by its near Situation, mu&s;t be be&s;t &s;uited for that Purpo&s;e; by which the Inflamma|tion, Delirium, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> u&s;ually attending the Di&s;ea&s;e, will with more Cer|tainty be relieved, than can be expected at &s;o great a Di&s;tance as the Leg is known to be, from the Seat of tho&s;e often fatal Symptoms: And it may here be ob&s;erved, that the fatal Symptoms, &s;o ju&s;tly complained of by our Author, are &s;uch as is &s;uppo&s;ed by him&s;elf (Page 20) to attend the Di&s;ea&s;e received in the natural Way only; but he has not produced us one In&s;tance of the&s;e fatal Symptoms attending the Di&s;ea&s;e under Inoculation in the Arm; nor do we believe it is in his Power to produce one in an Hundred, or perhaps double that Number, who have had the fatal Symptoms which he labours with the utmo&s;t Stretch of his Imagination to &s;upport; except in tho&s;e Ca&s;es, where large and deep Inci&s;ions have been made in the Arm, with the Intent of giving a Drain to the variolous Infection, which has been known to produce the very contrary Effect, by contaminating the Juices of the Body, and producing Symptoms of the wor&s;t Kind; but when the Inoculation has been performed by a Puncture in the Manner u&s;ed in <HI>Tur|key,</HI> and in &s;ome other of the <HI>Ea&s;tern</HI> Countries, or by a &s;mall Inci&s;ion, it has not been known that any ill Accidents have happened to the Patient from an Inci&s;ion made in the Arm, &s;imply con&s;idered, without &s;ome in|tervening Accident ari&s;ing from the Mi&s;conduct of the Patient, by ex|po&s;ing him&s;elf to cold Air, or from the Phy&s;ician's Pre&s;criptions, in direct|ing a low vegetable Diet, Specificks, preparatory Do&s;es, or &s;uch like Fooleries.</P>
<P>BUT it is &s;till a Point of no &s;mall Difficulty to reconcile, How Inocula|tion in the Arm &s;hould produce wor&s;e Con&s;equences, than if the Opera|tion had been performed in the Leg; when, at the &s;ame time, our Au|thor informs us (Page 22. Line 14.) <HI>That the Operation performed in the Leg, is frequently attended with Sores extremely difficult to heal, giving forth a corroding Matter, which both cats and inflames the adjacent Parts.</HI> To remedy which he propo&s;es his Catholicon, the <HI>Je&s;uits&mdash;Bark,</HI> the common Refuge of Ignorance, which too many make u&s;e of in almo&s;t every Ca&s;e, when they arrive to the <HI>Ne plus ultra</HI> of their Practice: But notwith&s;tand|ing our Author's high Opinion of this Drug, it may deceive us; for it is no

<P>THE fir&s;t Appearance of the <HI>Bilious Fever</HI> (called al&s;o the <HI>Yellow Fever</HI>) in this Province, was in <HI>July,</HI> 1741. and in <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> 1747. it made a &s;econd Vi&s;it; at its fir&s;t Appearance it &s;eem'd, e&s;pecially after three or four Weeks, to &s;hew a Di&s;po&s;ition more inclining to a remarkable Inflamma|tion of the animal Spirits, than at its Return in the Year 1747, in which Year, the animal Spirits &s;eemed not &s;o much exa&s;perated by an inflamma|tory Heat, as extingui&s;hed by the deleterious <HI>Mia&s;ma</HI> of the Di&s;ea&s;e, which introduced Gangrenes and Mortifications on the Stomach and <HI>Vi&s;cera,</HI> &s;uc|ceeded with black Vomits and cadaverous Stools; in both Ca&s;es the Ma|lignity &s;eemed to exert its dire Efforts on the Stomach and Liver: Which of the two was the fir&s;t Receptacle of this cruel Di&s;ea&s;e, we cannot &s;ay;
<PB N="13" REF="006697_0012_1029AB3ED02D1918">
but certain it was, that a much heated acrid Bile, was the proximate and in&s;trumental Cau&s;e of the tragical Appearances.</P>
<P>To reduce what we have farther to &s;ay on this Di&s;ea&s;e into as narrow a Compa&s;s as po&s;&s;ible, we &s;hall give as brief a Hi&s;tory of the Di&s;ea&s;e, in the two Years in which it vi&s;ited this Province, as the Limits of our Letter will allow, to &s;hew the pathognomick Signs, and Difference of the Di&s;|ea&s;e, as well as the different Methods of Cure u&s;ed in each.</P>
<P>IN the Year 1741. the Patient generally complained of an exce&s;&s;ive Pain and Heat in his Stomach, a great Anxiety, and Di&s;quietude, with a Pain of the Head, a quick tremulous Pul&s;e, and a feveri&s;h Heat, which &s;eemed to take its Ri&s;e, not &s;o much from an Inflammation of the &s;anguinary Fluids, as from the animal Spirits, and nervous Bodies being &s;timulated and di&s;turbed by the acrid and overheated Bile, lodged in the Stomach and <HI>Vi&s;cera;</HI> that this was the Cau&s;e of the Di&s;ea&s;e, appears very probable from the Ca&s;e of a Per&s;on (now living) taken ill of the Di&s;ea&s;e, who fre|quently would jump out of Bed in a &s;eeming delirious Surprize, attended with great Anxiety and Horror, who, when he came to him&s;elf, &s;aid it was occa&s;ioned by &s;omething darting like a Fla&s;h of Fire from his Sto|mach, through the Mu&s;cles of his Side and Neck, and di&s;charged it&s;elf with a &s;hocking Explo&s;ion into his Brain; which De&s;cription of its Pa&s;|&s;age from the Stomach to the Brain, &s;hews, I conceive, that the nervous Fluid being heated, rarified, and put into a tumultuous Di&s;order by the Me|diation of the Parvagum Nerves in the Stomach communicating with the Brain, and being perhaps propelled by Means of an electrical Effort, or by Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton</HI>'s ela&s;tick Spirit, was the Cau&s;e of this &s;urpri&s;ing Sen&s;ation: From hence, and from the univer&s;al Tremors, Anxieties, and Di&s;quietudes: the great Di&s;order of the Spirits and nervous Sy&s;tem were clearly manife&s;t; in which Ca&s;e to admini&s;ter Vomits, greatly exa&s;perated the Symptoms, and in&s;tead of relieving the Patient, brought on an irremediable Vomiting, Hiccough, and Inflammation of the Stomach; yet &s;ometimes a little warm Water, to clean&s;e the Stomach from the acrid Bile, was of Service; Bleed|ing the Patient, with a View to abate the feveri&s;h Heat, was &s;ucceeded with a Debility of the Pul&s;e, and Sinking of the Spirits; no warm Cor|dial or Alexipharmacs, did &s;eem to agree with the Di&s;ea&s;e; in this Ca&s;e a Do&s;e of <HI>Glaubers Salt,</HI> di&s;&s;olved in Sack-whey, or If the Heat at the Stomach was great, in Barley-drink, and repeated daily for three or four Days &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, greatly conduced to the removing of the Pain and Heat at the Stomach, with large Draughts of Chicken-broth, Sack-whey or Barley-drink, u&s;ed in the Working; which Purge was generally &s;ucceeded with a large Di&s;charge of a green acrid Bile, which &s;en&s;ibly relieved the
<PB N="14" REF="006697_0013_1029AB42160DF730">
Patient: And in the intermediate Times of taking the Salt, the Patient had frequently given him, a Spoonful of <HI>Riverius's</HI> Anti-emetick, which was made with Half a Drachm of Salt of Tartar di&s;&s;olved in two Spoon|fuls of Juice of Lemons, with the Addition of a little Treacle-water, and Spirit of Mint; and &s;ometimes <HI>Lapis Contrayerva,</HI> judiciou&s;ly mixed with Nitre, Saffron, Cochineal and Ca&s;tor, given every four Hours in Sack-whey; and after the Stomach and Bowels had been &s;ufficiently clean&s;ed from the di&s;tempered Bile, Bli&s;ters to the Neck and Wri&s;ts, with Sudori|ficks, Re&s;toratives and Pearl Juleps, rarely failed of bringing the Patient to a happy Recovery.</P>
<P>IN the Year 1747. the Pain and Heat at the Stomach was not &s;o gene|rally complained of by the Patient, e&s;pecially in the fir&s;t Days of the Ill|ne&s;s, as in the Year 1741. but the Pains of the Head, Back and whole Body, like wandering rheumatick Pains, were more perceivable; nor was the nervous Heat, or deadly Vomitings &s;o frequent, e&s;pecially in the fir&s;t two or three Days of the Illne&s;s, nor was the Pul&s;e altogether &s;o weak and tremulous; &s;o that in a <HI>Plethora</HI> it would &s;ometimes bear once Bleeding; gentle Vomits of warm Water, or Carduus-tea, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> upon a Sickne&s;s at the Stomach, might be taken with Advantage to the Patient: But although tho&s;e Symptoms were not on the fir&s;t two, or three Days violent, yet very often when the Patient was thought to have pa&s;t the wor&s;t of the Di&s;ea&s;e, he was &s;eized with all the fatal Appearances of Malignity, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> Hic|coughs, Anxieties, violent Pains of the Stomach, feveri&s;h Heats, and black Vomitings, &s;ucceeded with cold Sweats and Faintings, which generally concluded with cadaverous Stools, the fatal Pre&s;ages of a deadly Mortification of the Stomach and <HI>Vi&s;cera;</HI> in which Ca&s;e the above Medicines and Methods u&s;ed in the Year 1741. judiciou&s;ly made u&s;e of at the fir&s;t Appearance of the Di&s;ea&s;e, were found to an&s;wer the wi&s;h'd for End. But when, from the flattering Appearances of the Di&s;|ea&s;e, or mi&s;taken Expectations from the U&s;e of other Medicines, the pro|per Methods had been neglected in the fir&s;t Days of the Di&s;ea&s;e, the Ma|lignity &s;o far prevailed, as to re&s;i&s;t the mo&s;t powerful Remedies.</P>
<P>IT may be nece&s;&s;ary further to ob&s;erve, That the Fever of the Year 1747. of which we are now treating, did di&s;tingui&s;h it&s;elf from the pre|ceding Year 1741. by a large and copious Di&s;charge by Vomit, and &s;ome|times by Stool, of a grumous Fluid, not much unlike Coffee-grounds, which &s;ometimes appeared mixed with Blood and rotten Membranes, this was called the <HI>Black Vomit,</HI> which before the Mixture of Blood and rotten Membranes did appear (which were deadly Symptoms) would often yield to the U&s;e of the above Remedies; but when it proved difficult to be
<PB N="15" REF="006697_0014_1029AB48D5C86A80">
&s;topped (which would greatly aggravate the fatal Symptoms) the only Re|medy which appeared effectual in the Ca&s;e, was a Mixture of di&s;tilled Vi|negar and Spirit of Mint, which &s;ometimes would put a Stop to the Vo|miting, even when the fatal Symptoms had made their Appearance. And it is farther to be ob&s;erved, that in the Di&s;ea&s;e of the preceding Year, acid Medicines, even Juice of Lemons, were for the mo&s;t Part di&s;agreeable to the &s;ick Patient; yet in this Year 1747. they had a better Effect, and were generally, both more acceptable and u&s;eful to the Patient, e&s;pecially <HI>Spiritus Nitri Dulcis,</HI> mixed with a mild Cordial Julep, which greatly cooled and refre&s;hed the &s;ick and much di&s;turbed Stomach; to which Purpo&s;e, Tartar-whey greatly contributed; and &s;ometimes a gentle com|po&s;ing Draught, which much refre&s;hed the Sick, after the violent Heat and Rage of the Di&s;ea&s;e was over; provided the low and vapid Condition of the Spirits (which in this Ca&s;e was very perceivable) did not forbid the U&s;e of this otherwi&s;e comfortable Medicine.</P>
<P>FROM the above I think it is evident, that Catharthicks, by promoting a Secretion of the di&s;temper'd Bile, and clean&s;ing the Stomach and <HI>Vi&s;cera,</HI> were the mo&s;t advantageous. Medicines in the Cure of this <HI>Bilious Fever,</HI> e&s;pecially &s;ince it appears, that the Di&s;ea&s;e was of a Nature which would not admit of waiting, for either Dige&s;tion, or critical Days; &s;o that to have rigorou&s;ly obey'd the Aphori&s;m of <HI>Hippocrates, Concocta non cruda, medi|canda &s;unt,</HI> would have expo&s;ed the Patient to the utmo&s;t Fury of this mo&s;t de&s;tructive Di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>As to our Author's &s;uppo&s;ed Excellence of the Bark, in the Cure of putrid Ulcers, notwith&s;tanding the Recommendations of Dr. <HI>Monro,</HI> and others, it has not been found, in many Trials which have been made of it in that Ca&s;e, to do more than might have been expected from Wine medicated with Cinnamon; and yet much &s;hort of an <HI>Aqua Calcis</HI> &s;uited to the Temperament of the Patient, and other Circum&s;tances attending the Ca&s;e: And it is highly rea&s;onable to believe, that the Cures &s;uppo&s;ed by Dr. <HI>Monro,</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Medical E&s;&s;ays, Edinb.</HI> Edit. Vol. 3. Page 38. Idem Ibid, Vol. 4.

BUT to return to our Author: It will here be worth our Notice to con|&s;ider, how the variolous Infection applied to an Inci&s;ion, made in the Arm, &s;hould affect the Brain, by Means of Arteries terminating in the Part, where the Inci&s;ion was made: <HI>The Arteries</HI> (&s;ays our Author, Page 22. Line 2.) <HI>which &s;upply the Arms, come from the Subclavians, and they derive their Original from the a&s;cending Trunk of the</HI> Aorta. But how an Artery at its Extremity, &s;hould convey the variolous Infection to Parts far above it, will be as difficult, as to &s;ay, by what Means a Stone &s;hall rai&s;e it&s;elf up into the middle Region of the Air, without the Help of a mechanical Power, to repel the Force of Attraction: The Blood in the Extremities of the Arteries (by their Ana&s;tomo&s;is with the Veins) is return|ed back to the Heart, where by Means of the a&s;cending and de&s;cending Trunks of the <HI>Vena Cava</HI> uniting in one, they di&s;charge their Contents into the right Ventricle of the Heart; where the whole Ma&s;s of refluent Blood is there mixed, and from thence is conveyed by the <HI>Aorta</HI> into all Parts of the Body; &s;o that from the &s;tated Laws of Circulation, it does not &s;eem very po&s;&s;ible, that the Infection &s;hould be conveyed towards the Head, rather than the more inferior Parts of the Body; therefore what the Gentleman &s;uppo&s;es, <HI>That it would be much to the Benefit and Safety of the Patient,</HI> is an Imagination not founded on the Laws or Principles of phy&s;ical Learning, which he &s;o highly lays Claim to.</P>
<P>THUS Sir, I have fini&s;hed what I at fir&s;t propos'd, which was to give you my Sentiments upon that Part of the Di&s;cour&s;e, which more par|ticularly relates to the Pre&s;ervation of Per&s;ons labouring under that too often &s;evere Illne&s;s, the SMALL-POX; and if what I have done may con|duce to give you a ju&s;t Caution to avoid the Vanity of Hypothe&s;is and ill grounded Conceits, I &s;hall have my End: For I do a&s;&s;ure you, it was neither Vanity, or an Itch of Writing, which led me to undertake a Ta&s;k of this Nature; but to detect Mi&s;takes in a Matter which &s;o high|ly concerns the Welfare of Mankind.</P>
