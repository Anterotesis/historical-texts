<Q>WHEREFORE YE MUST NEEDS BE SUBJECT, NOT ONLY FOR WRATH, BUT FOR CONSCIENCE SAKE.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE Apo&s;tle PAUL appears to have been an adept in philo&s;ophy, ethics and politics. In his ac|quaintance with human nature he was equalled by few. Knowing the will of his divine Teacher, and having imbibed his &s;pirit, with irre&s;i&s;tible arguments, enforced by a captivating addre&s;s, and all the power of rhetoric, he inculcated the intere&s;ting doctrines and &s;acred maxims of chri&s;tianity. Well ver&s;ed in the principles of civil government, and knowing the importance of the influence of chri&s;tianity upon the minds and con|duct of men to the happine&s;s of civil &s;ociety, as well as to their preparation for another and more glorious &s;tate, with the authority of an Apo&s;tle in&s;pired by the Holy Gho&s;t and commi&s;&s;ioned from the King of Kings, he &s;olemnly exhorts, "let every &s;oul be &s;ubject to the higher powers: For there is no power but of GOD: The powers that be, are ordained of GOD." The meaning undoubtedly is, that civil government, through the in&s;trumentality of men, was in&s;tituted by the provi|dence of God, for the benefit of mankind, On this principle, civil magi&s;trates are appointed, not for their own honor, emolument or aggrandizement, but to pro|mote and private and public peace and happine&s;s, by di&s;|countenancing
<PB N="6" REF="030454_0005_0FE6E25FF1681628">
vice, and encouraging virtue and reli|gion. To &s;uch a government, well admini&s;tered, chri&s;|tianity requires peaceable and quiet &s;ubjection; and en|forces it with this &s;olemn denunciation again&s;t tho&s;e, who re&s;i&s;t &s;uch a government; they re&s;i&s;t the ordinance of GOD, and &s;hall receive to them&s;elves damnation.&mdash;Such &s;ubjection is required not from a principle of fear only, but for con&s;cience fake. The Apo&s;tle means a con&s;cience enlightened by the principles of Chri&s;tiani|ty, and &s;anctified by the &s;pirit of grace. We mu&s;t therefore be &s;ubject, not for wrath only, but from a &s;till higher motive, a &s;en&s;e of obligation to Deity and the indi&s;&s;oluble bonds of con&s;cience.</P>
<P>THE words of the text may therefore properly &s;tand as the head of the following di&s;cour&s;e; in which a few thoughts may be &s;ugge&s;ted upon the nece&s;&s;ity and im|portance of virtue and religion to the &s;upport and &s;uc|ce&s;s of civil government.</P>
<P>THE Apo&s;tle does not pre&s;cribe any particular form of government: This is left to the wi&s;dom and di&s;cre|tion of men; with which chri&s;tianity never intermed|dles. It is evident from the Apo&s;tle however; that government ought to be founded upon the ju&s;t rights of mankind, and to be admini&s;tered for the be&s;t intere&s;ts of &s;ociety. They greatly mi&s;take the Apo&s;tle there|fore, who &s;uppo&s;e him to favor the horrid doctrine of pa&s;&s;ive obedience and non-re&s;i&s;tance. Such language is fit only for a de&s;pot to an untaught, barbarous peo|ple. If this were the Apo&s;tle's meaning, no oppo&s;ition ought to be made to the greate&s;t tyranny on earth. No revolution might then take place; but men, like brutes, mu&s;t &s;ubmit to &s;till more bruti&s;h men; patiently wear the galling yoke, and drag out the burden of life in mi&s;erable &s;ervitude without re&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>THE Apo&s;tle teaches no &s;uch doctrine. Chri&s;tianity in by no means adapted to encourage oppre&s;&s;ion and tyranny. No form of government yet con&s;tructed,
<PB N="7" REF="030454_0006_0FE6E263B4185D60">
ever was &s;o congenial to chri&s;tianity, as a well regulat|ed Republic. No religion, ever yet known, is &s;o con|formable to the genius of a free government, as chri&s;|tianity.</P>
<P>WHOEVER critically attends to human nature, the de&s;ign of civil government, and the influence of religi|ous principles on the minds and conduct of men, will ea&s;ily perceive how e&s;&s;ential morality and religion are to the peace and happine&s;s of civil &s;ociety. There are in mankind a variety of de&s;ires and pa&s;&s;ions, whence all their actions proceed. In the pre&s;ent &s;tate of hu|man depravity, unhappily for us, the&s;e de&s;ires and pa&s;|&s;ions are frequently at variance with each other.&mdash;This circum&s;tance, in &s;pite of philo&s;ophy and natural religion, will create a cla&s;hing of intere&s;t, that will pro|duce tho&s;e different opinions and oppo&s;ing actions, whence di&s;tre&s;&s;ing evils may en&s;ue. To prevent &s;uch mi&s;chiefs, the invention of civil government undoubt|edly took its ri&s;e. If the de&s;ires and pa&s;&s;ions of men were duly regulated, civil government and penal laws would be unnece&s;&s;ary. Men would then never err, except through mi&s;apprehen&s;ion, which information and the benevolent affections would always rectify.&mdash;But human nature is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the pa&s;&s;ions of &s;elfi&s;h|ne&s;s and ambition, envy and jealou&s;y, which unre&s;trained would produce di&s;cord, &s;trife, and every evil work.</P>
<P>CIVIL government is a kind of machine, which the nece&s;&s;ities of mankind have compelled them to erect for the re&s;traint of &s;uch de&s;ires and pa&s;&s;ions as, if let alone, would be ruinous to the public peace and hap|pine&s;s of &s;ociety. The&s;e machines ought to be &s;o con&s;|tructed and managed, as in their operations to effect that public peace and happine&s;s, which may be &s;en&s;ibly felt, and realized by the people. But the&s;e machines require &s;omething more, than the power and influence of penal laws, to pre&s;erve them in order, and promote their great and important u&s;es. The great art of ma|naging
<PB N="8" REF="030454_0007_0FE6E263C11BC488">
government well con&s;i&s;ts in laying the de&s;ires, the pa&s;&s;ions and lu&s;ts of men under proper re&s;traint.&mdash;But how can this be done? The experience of ages decides that penal laws alone are inadequate to the purpo&s;e. Though in many in&s;tances they may be effi|cacious, yet in general they do not reform the deprav|ed minds of the lawle&s;s, nor correct the vicious habits of the licentious. Fear of puni&s;hment may prevent many crimes; but, as it does not de&s;troy the de&s;ires and pa&s;&s;ions which originate them, whenever this fear, through the hope or pro&s;pect of impunity, &s;ub&s;ides, the &s;ame pa&s;&s;ions will again urge on to licentiou&s;ne&s;s and criminalty. Human rea&s;on and philo&s;ophy are not of them&s;elves &s;ufficient to &s;ecure the permanent peace and happine&s;s of &s;ociety from the depradations of licentious de&s;ires and pa&s;&s;ions. Further aid beyond any thing civil government ab&s;tractedly con&s;idered em|braces, is nece&s;&s;ary to &s;upport it, and to &s;ecure the liberties and happine&s;s of the people. Religion prof|fers this aid. The very de&s;ign of chri&s;tianity is to re|form mankind, to meliorate their tempers, to bring them to di&s;charge their duty to GOD, and one another, and through the merits of the Redeemer to fit them for happine&s;s in the world to come. The &s;pirit of the religion of JESUS, thoroughly imbibed, would check all dangerous a&s;piring ambition, and tho&s;e re&s;tle&s;s jealou&s;ies, which &s;o often di&s;turb the peace of mankind. Chri&s;tianity embraces the true principles of free go|vernments, as founded, not in u&s;urpation, tyranny, or oppre&s;&s;ion, but in the true freedom and happine&s;s of mankind. Divine revelation de&s;cribes the character of good rulers, as men of wi&s;dom and under&s;tanding; and requires that they be able men, &s;uch as fear GOD, and hate covetou&s;ne&s;s. Thus &s;aid David, the &s;pirit of the Lord &s;pake by me, the GOD of I&s;rael &s;aid, HE, that ruleth over men, mu&s;t be ju&s;t, ruling in the fear of GOD. Such rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil. They are Mini&s;ters of GOD for the good of the people. The &s;acred Oracles teach us, that,
<PB N="9" REF="030454_0008_0FE6E26C5E483A50">
though they live, as GOD upon earth, they mu&s;t die like men, and be accountable to him, by whom King's reign and Princes decree ju&s;tice; who taketh not bribes, and is no re&s;pecter of per&s;ons.</P>
<P>IF a government u&s;urp an authority, and claim the exerci&s;e of a power, with which they never were in|ve&s;ted; or if one branch of government &s;hould leap its own pre&s;cribed limits, and invade the prerogative of another; or if the people &s;hould claim the exer|ci&s;e of that authority, which they have delegated to their rulers; in all &s;uch ca&s;es the order and harmony of government will be nece&s;&s;arily interrupted, the pub|lic felicity &s;uffer, and the liberties of the people be en|dangered. Hence &s;uch conte&s;ts may ari&s;e between peace and faction, government and anarchy, as will &s;hake, if not de&s;troy, the very foundation of public happine&s;s. To prevent the&s;e fatal evils, chri&s;tianity requires that nothing be done through &s;trife and vain glory. But that each in lowline&s;s of mind e&s;teem others better, than him&s;elf. That every one &s;tudy to be quiet, and to do his own bu&s;ine&s;s; not going be|yond, nor defrauding others in any matter. Chri&s;ti|anity teaches to render to all their dues; tribute, to whom tribute; cu&s;tom to whom cu&s;tom; fear, to whom fear; honor, to whom honor. We are not to &s;peak evil of dignities; nor u&s;e our liberty for a cloak of maliciou&s;ne&s;ts, but as the &s;ervants of GOD. We are to lead quiet and peaceable lives in all godline&s;s and hone&s;ty; and in all things, what&s;over we would that men &s;hould do unto us, even &s;o to do unto them. All this is to be done from love to GOD and our neighbor; and from a religious regard to duty.</P>
<P>No &s;ub&s;titute was ever yet found equal to virtue and religion for the &s;upport of order and good go|vernment. They, who reject the&s;e, may boa&s;t of their con&s;titutions, their laws and admini&s;tration; but nei|ther the wi&s;e&s;t con&s;titutions, mo&s;t rigid laws, nor &s;trong nerved officers, dreary pri&s;ons, nor &s;evere&s;t puni&s;h|ments,
<PB N="10" REF="030454_0009_0FE6E26C65C05E20">
without the aid of virtue and religion can &s;e|cure the permanent felicity of civil &s;ociety. The boa&s;ted powers of philo&s;ophy, of natural rea&s;on, and national honor are all too feeble or capricious to be depended on to effect that manly, that regular, and uniform mode of conduct, which is the natural offspring of virtue and religion. Natural religion is of high importance, and its inducements to righteou&s;ne&s;s and truth peace and good order are numerous and weighty; but they fall far &s;hort of the motives of chri&s;tianity and give le&s;s &s;ecurity to the liberty and happine&s;s of civil &s;ociety. The influence of the former terminates with this life; but the latter embraces motives drawn from the con&s;ideration of a future &s;tate; that the ac|tions of men as moral agents will be rewarded or puni&s;hed in the world to come. The&s;e are motives the &s;tronge&s;t and mo&s;t influential, that can apply to the con&s;ciences of men. Without the&s;e the public, in many ca&s;es, can have no &s;ecurity. The con&s;cientious man, in full belief of the exi&s;tence of GOD, and the truth of chri&s;tianity, as an hone&s;t man and &s;incere chri&s;tian, acts as under the eye of the all&s;eeing and heart &s;earching Deity, who will bring every &s;ecret thing into judgment, puni&s;h the guilty, and beautify the meek with &s;alvation.</P>
<P>BUT what has the infidel to do with con&s;cience, who&s;e mind is contaminated with unbelief? Who&s;e principles are de&s;tructive both of religion and morality; and who&s;e con&s;cience is feared as with an hot iron by deeply rooted vicious habits? What dependence can &s;ociety place on &s;uch characters? A foe to GOD is not a friend of man. Re&s;training laws, nece&s;&s;ary as they are for the prevention of crimes, can never reach the evil of abandoned principles and vicious habits, &s;o as to effect a remedy. Such characters may &s;ometimes act for the public good; but this is only, when &s;uch a line of conduct coincides with &s;ome favorite pa&s;&s;ion&mdash;They always change with the current of their pa&s;&s;ions and intere&s;ts. Such men are un&s;table in all their ways.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="030454_0010_0FE6E26ECCE0EBB8">IN connexion with the power of con&s;cience, we may in&s;tance the importance of the influence of religion, in the u&s;e of lawful oaths. An oath is a &s;olemn appeal to GOD, for the truth of what is affirmed or promi&s;ed: It implies an imprecation of the ju&s;t and righteous judg|ment of GOD, if what the per&s;on declares, be not true; or if, in what he promi&s;es, he &s;hould not be faithful. An oath is therefore a &s;olemn religious act, implying the imprecation of the wrath of GOD upon a per&s;on, if he be guilty of perjury. Dreadful is the puni&s;hment threatened in &s;uch ca&s;es. A cur&s;e &s;hall enter into the hou&s;e of him that &s;weareth fal&s;ely by the name of the LORD!</P>
<P>THE utility and nece&s;&s;ity of oaths in ca&s;es of evidence and in laying a per&s;on under &s;olemn obligation to fide|lity, in the di&s;charge of the duties of his office, have been known and acknowledged among mo&s;t nations. An oath of confirmation, &s;ays the Apo&s;tle, is an end of &s;trife. As a kind of &s;anction to the lawfulne&s;s and utility of oaths in important ca&s;es, the Deity him&s;elf, graciou&s;ly conde&s;cended to confirm his promi&s;e to Abraham by an oath. Oaths of evidence and of office are of &s;o much importance, that civil government would be un|&s;afe without them. It would be difficult, if not im|po&s;&s;ible to invent a &s;ub&s;titute, that would an&s;wer the purpo&s;e. "Becau&s;e, as one ob&s;erves, the obligation of an oath reacheth to the mo&s;t &s;ecret and hidden practices of men, and takes hold of them in many ca&s;es, where the penalty of human laws can have no awe or force upon them." But what is the oath of an infidel, or of a man void of religion? What &s;ecurity can the public have from the oath of a per&s;on, who does not be|lieve there will be a future &s;tate of rewards and pun|i&s;hments? What obligations of con&s;cience can &s;uch a per&s;on feel? His taking the form of an oath while he is regardle&s;s of that being, by whom he &s;wears, is no better, than &s;olemn mockery. The public, it may be repeated, have no &s;ecurity from &s;uch oaths. The util|ity
<PB N="12" REF="030454_0011_0FE6E26ED5BC9EF8">
and nece&s;&s;ity of oaths therefore, to the public &s;afety and happine&s;s evince the nece&s;&s;ity of religious princi|ples and virtuous habits. In the days of Polybius &s;uch, we are told, was the corruption of the principles and morals of the people of Athens, that, "no Greek could be tru&s;ted on the &s;ecurity of his oath." But in the republic of Rome, antecedently to their abound|ing licentiou&s;ne&s;s, &s;uch was the impre&s;&s;ion of their re|ligious principles and virtuous habits on young minds, "that no Roman was ever known to violate his oath."</P>
<P>THE pa&s;&s;ions of men, unawed by religion and con|&s;cience, are dangerous, and ruinous to the freedom and happine&s;s of civil &s;ociety.</P>
<P>WHEN loo&s;e principles, ungovernable pa&s;&s;ions, and vicious habits take place of morality and religion; ambition and avarice, revenge and thir&s;t for dominion in the di&s;appointed, or envy again&s;t tho&s;e, who ri&s;e a|bove them in wealth and honor, united with di&s;hone&s;|ty and intrigue, &s;ow the &s;eeds of di&s;cord among the people, excite jealou&s;ies, rai&s;e factions, and di&s;turb the public tranquility; and, if unre&s;trained, would throw government, yea even the world it&s;elf into confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>THE evil effects of irreligion and immorality may be exemplified from the univer&s;al hi&s;tory of mankind. A few in&s;tances may be &s;ufficient to confirm the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>WHOEVER attends to the hi&s;tory of that ancient na|tion, the Jews, will find the&s;e ob&s;ervations verified. When Balaam found that every other expedient to bring de&s;truction upon I&s;rael failed, he laid a diabolical &s;cheme to corrupt and debauch the morals of the peo|ple, and by this mean effected their ruin. To the &s;ame cau&s;e, the corruption of principles and morals, may be traced the final de&s;truction of the Jewi&s;h policy, church, and &s;tate.</P>
<P>THE ancient republic of Sparta through the extraor|dinary policy and rigid laws of Lycurgus, aided by
<PB N="13" REF="030454_0012_0FE6E278990384C8">
principles and habits impre&s;&s;ed upon the young mind by a &s;ingular mode of education, exi&s;ted for almo&s;t &s;even hundred years. While it remained cemented by the force of principles and manners, it bore down all oppo&s;ition, and bid defiance to the world. But it fi|nally fell a &s;acrifice to di&s;&s;olute manners and lawle&s;s fac|tion.</P>
<P>To &s;imilar cau&s;es may be a&s;&s;cribed the ruin of the famous, though &s;hort lived republic of Athens. So|lon lived to &s;ee the fabric of freedom, which he had erected, fall to de&s;truction. He gave them laws, which he acknowledged were not the be&s;t that might have been given, but the be&s;t they could bear. On his departure from Athens political &s;torms aro&s;e; aided by an unprincipled licentious populace, demagogues took the lead, deluded the people, feized the &s;trong hold, and e&s;tabli&s;hed a &s;y&s;tem of tyranny. The free|dom of Athens was never recovered. That once famed republic, overrun with ignorance and barbari&s;m, now groans under Turki&s;h tyranny, and Mahometan impo&s;|ture.</P>
<P>THE feuds and factions, which eventually proved the overthrow of the freedom, and the republic of Rome, may be traced up to the &s;ame de&s;tructive foun|tain of bad principles and di&s;&s;olute morals of the peo|ple. "They adopted the luxury, the immoralities, and irreligion of other nations." The&s;e in coincidence with their own pa&s;&s;ions effected their complete ruin. Thus that renowned republic, which nothing el&s;e could conquer, was conquered by its own vices. "A cor|ruption of manners and numerous crimes, &s;ays a di&s;tin|gui&s;hed writer, made greater havoc in the city, than the mightie&s;t armies could have done; and in that manner avenged the conquered globe."</P>
<P>As human nature in all ages of the world is the &s;ame, like cau&s;es, under &s;imilar circum&s;tances, in whatever period or part of the globe, will produce like effects. Happy will it be for America, if we avoid the
<PB N="14" REF="030454_0013_0FE6E278A0893558">
rocks, again&s;t which &s;o many others have been da&s;hed in pieces.</P>
<P>MANY important inferences and reflections, appo&s;ite to the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion &s;ugge&s;t them&s;elves from the &s;ub|ject.</P>
<P>IF the influence of virtue and religion are &s;o e&s;&s;ential in pre&s;erving the freedom and &s;ecuring the permanent felicity of civil &s;ociety; the cultivation of good prin|ciples and virtuous morals among the people may be con&s;idered, as an object highly meriting the regard of our Legi&s;lative, Judicial, and Executive branches of government. What encouragement then &s;hould be given by our civil Rulers, by all influential men, and every cla&s;s of citizens, to morality, religion and piety; and to all chri&s;tian in&s;titutions, as calculated to pro|mote &s;uch happy effects.</P>
<P>IF civil government thus needs the aid of good prin|ciples and virtuous habits, to render its operations hap|py and permanent, it mu&s;t be a hazardous experiment for any nation under Heaven to reject that aid, on &s;up|po&s;ition that con&s;titutions and human laws are &s;ufficient without it, to &s;ecure peace and good order, and the rights and privileges of the people. Men may form con&s;titutions, enact laws, di&s;play their philo&s;ophy, and exert all their eloquence in conjunction with coercion, but all will be in&s;ufficient for the permanent &s;ecurity of freedom and good government, without the aid of reli|gion.</P>
<P>REASONING from human nature and pa&s;t events, we might venture to predict, if any nation &s;hould have the temerity to ca&s;t off morality and religion, as unnece&s;&s;a|ry to the happine&s;s of civil &s;ociety, it would in the e|vent pay dearly for the experiment; and find, per|haps too late, that their own folly was their ruin.</P>
<P>FROM the foregoing ob&s;ervations we may infer the high importance of a virtuous education.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="030454_0014_0FE6E27A0EE5D3D8">IN countries, where religion is only the tool of &s;tates and of tyrants, the more ignorant the people are, the more ea&s;ily they may be impo&s;ed upon and en&s;laved. It is the intere&s;t of &s;uch governments therefore, to keep the great ma&s;s of the people in ignorance. But, as mankind were not made for &s;lavery, an enlightened virtuous people will never &s;uffer them&s;elves to be long en&s;laved. If, through &s;upine&s;s and inattention, tyranny, &s;hould &s;lip on the galling yoke, and fa&s;ten upon them the chain of &s;lavery, they would &s;oon feel their mi&s;e|ry, and with a manly virtuous re&s;entment rai&s;e the all conquering arm of liberty, and break the yoke, as a withe of &s;traw, and &s;nap the chain, as a &s;piders web.</P>
<P>A virtuous education is e&s;&s;ential to the permanent felicity of all free governments. "The infant mind, &s;ays a writer of note, left to its own untutored dictates, inevitably wanders into &s;uch follies and vices, as tend to the de&s;truction of it&s;elf and others." "The early and continued culture of the heart can alone produce &s;uch upright manners and principles, as are nece&s;&s;ary to check and &s;ubdue the pa&s;&s;ions of the &s;oul; and liberty can only ari&s;e from a general &s;ubordination of the&s;e to the public welfare."</P>
<P>EDUCATION in general forms the characters of men. Principles in&s;tilled into the mind, and habits formed in early life, lay a foundation, for the happine&s;s or mi&s;e|ry of the world. They verify the &s;acred maxim, train up a child in the way, he &s;hould go; and, when he is old, he will not depart from it.</P>
<P>IMPRSSEED with the&s;e ideas, our pious ance&s;tors made the earlie&s;t exertion for the diffu&s;ion of know|ledge, and the promotion of morality and religion a|mong the people. Their de&s;ign has been happily aided by many chri&s;tian Patriots, who&s;e numerous cha|ritable donations for the promotion of knowledge and religion, while they have &s;o greatly &s;erved to advance private and public happine&s;s, have at the &s;ame time
<PB N="16" REF="030454_0015_0FE64C7D8B301ED8">
laid up for the pious and charitable donors a rich in|heritance in heaven!</P>
<P>WE are happy in living under a government, where the great object of promoting learning and religion has arre&s;ted the attention of our wi&s;e and patriotic Legi&s;|lators, who from time to time have enacted &s;uch laws, as, if carried into execution, would prove the grand palladium of our republic. Our Legi&s;latros have de|clared that "a general di&s;&s;emination of knowledge and virtue is nece&s;&s;ary to the pro&s;perity of every &s;tate, and to the very exi&s;tence of a Commonwealth."</P>
<P>To promote the great de&s;ign of a virtuous education, a pre&s;ent exi&s;ting law of this Commonwealth, makes it the "duty of the Pre&s;ident, Profe&s;&s;ors, and Tutors of the Univer&s;ity in Cambridge, Preceptors of Acade|mies, and all other In&s;tructors of youth, to take dili|gent care, and to exert their be&s;t endeavours, to im|pre&s;s on the minds of children and youth committed to their care an in&s;truction, the principles of piety, ju&s;tice, and a &s;acred regard to truth, love to their country, humanity and univer&s;al benevolence, &s;obriety, indu&s;try, and frugality, cha&s;tity, moderation, and temperance, and tho&s;e other virtues, which are the ornament of human &s;ociety, and the ba&s;is, upon which the republican con&s;titution is &s;tructured; and it &s;hall be the duty of &s;uch In&s;tructors, to endeavor to lead tho&s;e under their care (as their ages and capacities will admit) into a particular under&s;tanding of the tendency of the be|fore mentioned virtues, to pre&s;erve, and perfect a repub|lican con&s;titution, and to &s;ecure the ble&s;&s;ings of liberty as well, as to promote their future happine&s;s; and the tendency of the oppo&s;ite vices to &s;lavery."</P>
<P>MAY this monument of the wi&s;dom and patrioti&s;m of the Legi&s;lature, who framed it, be as la&s;ting, as the world.</P>
<P>THIS leads us to reflect upon the importance of in|tru&s;ting the in&s;truction of youth to tho&s;e only, who are
<PB N="17" REF="030454_0016_0FE6E27D17D52A70">
of religion and good morals; who will teach by ex|ample as well, as precept.</P>
<P>HAPPY will it be for the&s;e ri&s;ing States, if our Le|gi&s;lative and Executive branches of government be im|pre&s;&s;ed with the idea, that without clo&s;e attention to the virtuous education of youth, republicani&s;m, free|dom, and public happine&s;s can never be pre&s;erved.</P>
<P>FROM a regard to the happine&s;s of the people, pri|vate and public, pre&s;ent and future, our civil fathers, we may hope, will give every encouragement to literary and religious in&s;titutions. Par&s;imony in the &s;upport of education and religion is a kind of &s;acrilege, in which we cheat our&s;elves and the ri&s;ing generation, injure the public, and rob GOD of his due.</P>
<P>IF morality and religion be thus e&s;&s;ential to public happine&s;s and the &s;upport of free governments, it mu&s;t then be of high importance, that our rulers be virtuous and good men.</P>
<P>I BELIEVE it may be con&s;idered, as an unfailing max|im, that no man can in heart be a true republican, who is not a per&s;on of piety and good morals. An in|fidel, immoral true republican is a &s;oleci&s;m in language. Con&s;equently no man, who is unfriendly to religion in profe&s;&s;ion or practice, ought to be intru&s;ted with any im|portant concerns in government. If it be pleaded, that bad men in many in&s;tances have done great good to the public; it may be replied, this happens only, when the &s;elfi&s;h principles and pa&s;&s;ions chance to coincide with the public good. Such cannot be confided in. Spe|cial caution ought to be u&s;ed again&s;t all tho&s;e, who treat chri&s;tianity with contempt. Whatever &s;uch men may pretend, I appeal to the &s;erious part of the community, whether an enemy to the cro&s;s of CHRIST can be a friend to mankind? The liberties of the people can ne|ver be &s;afe in the hands of unprincipled men. While the following maxim remains an eternal truth, "That can never be politically right, which is morally wrong;"
<PB N="18" REF="030454_0017_0FE6E27D1F561458">
an unprincipled man can never be a good politician, and ought never to be confided in by the people.</P>
<P>THE example of wi&s;e and religious rulers, if ju&s;tly e&s;teemed, will have great influence upon the people.&mdash;For, in a general way, we may &s;ay with the wi&s;e &s;on of Sirach, "As is the judge of the people him&s;elf, &s;o are his officers; and what manner of man the ruler of the city is, &s;uch are they, that dwell therein." From the imitative nature of man, the power of example lays an indi&s;pen&s;ible obligation upon rulers, and upon all influ|ential men, to exhibit an example of virtue and piety in all their words and actions.</P>
<P>HAPPY mu&s;t it be for that people, who&s;e rulers feel the weight of this obligation. Bad examples are al|ways contagious. The higher men are called in life, the greater in general is the influence of their example. If legi&s;lators di&s;regard the laws, they have framed, they practically declare &s;uch laws are of no con&s;equence.&mdash;One of the mo&s;t effectual methods, to induce men to obey the laws, is for tho&s;e, who pre&s;cribe them, to &s;et the example. Highly favored is that people, who&s;e legi&s;lators may each, with an hone&s;t heart &s;ay, as a great and wi&s;e ruler in I&s;rael &s;aid to the people, "look on me, as I do, &s;o do ye."</P>
<P>IN every view it mu&s;t be the highe&s;t wi&s;dom in all elections to have an eye to the religious character of men as well, as to the other qualifications. What can have greater influence upon the minds and con&s;|ciences of Rulers, to excite them to fidelity in di&s;charge of the duties of their office, than an habitual &s;en&s;e of the all &s;eeing eye of Deity, joined to a firm per&s;ua&s;ion, that the mo&s;t exalted, who live, as GODS on earth, mu&s;t die like men, and appear at the awful tribunal of GOD, who is no re&s;pecter of per&s;ons, and be adjudg|ed and rewarded according to their works.</P>
<P>IF the influence of religion be &s;o e&s;&s;ential to pub|lic happine&s;s; then the encouraging of virtue and
<PB N="19" REF="030454_0018_0FE6E280A62F5C30">
piety, and di&s;countenancing of all profanity, intempe|rance, profanation of the Lord's day; all public &s;hows, and plays, and every thing, which tends to di&s;&s;ipate the minds, and corrupt the morals of youth, or the people at large, claim the attention of our wi&s;e and virtuous Rulers, the guardians of our laws and liber|ties. On &s;ome of the&s;e vices, particularly on profanity, intemperance, and profanation of the holy Sabbath, with their baneful influence upon &s;ociety, I might ex|patiate, were it not that I &s;hould intrude too much upon your patience. One vice however I cannot for|bear to mention. I mean &s;lander or detraction. This, whether it proceed from the tongue, the pen, or the pre&s;s, is an evil of the meane&s;t, blacke&s;t die, and of the mo&s;t mi&s;chievous tendency. Its envenomed &s;hafts often aim a deadly blow at the faire&s;t and mo&s;t impor|tant characters, to wound and de&s;troy that good name, which is better, than great riches; yea, that is next to life it&s;elf. When long tried virtue, di&s;tingui&s;hed merit, and &s;ignal &s;ervices are repaid with ingratitude and abu&s;e, can it be expected, that men of integrity will be willing to continue in the &s;ervice of their coun|try? If men of this character be driven from office, and others &s;ucceed them, who prefer private emolu|ment to the public welfare, we &s;hall, when too late, rue the folly and wickedne&s;s of the conduct, which produced the change. Slander is an evil of &s;uch mag|nitude, that no bounds can be &s;et to its mi&s;chievous con&s;equence. Well might the wi&s;e preacher call the defamer a madman, who ca&s;teth fire-brands, arrows, and death. With infinite rea&s;on did the in&s;pired A|po&s;tle repre&s;ent the defaming tongue, as a fire, a world of iniquity, that &s;etteth on fire the cour&s;e of nature, and as &s;et on fire of hell.</P>
<P>THERE is nothing however, to be feared from an open, manly, hone&s;t, and decent inve&s;tigation of pub|lic men and mea&s;ures. The right of free di&s;cu&s;&s;ion and private judgement is the glory of every free Ameri|can. But, when this degenerates into fal&s;ehood, &s;cur|rility,
<PB N="20" REF="030454_0019_0FE6E280AFA54018">
and per&s;onal abu&s;e; no indignation nor con|tempt can be too great to be expre&s;&s;ed again&s;t it.&mdash;Happy, thrice happy will it be for America, when the principles of chri&s;tianity, and the energy of good morals &s;hall influence every heart, dictate every tougue, and guide in every action. Then will harmony of opinion, peace, and truth pervade every part of the United States. Then will wrath and bitterne&s;s cea&s;e, faction hide its mon&s;trous head, iniquity be done away, and, the kingdom of the Redeemer flouri&s;h.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t pa&s;t over many other inferences and re|flections, which naturally &s;ugge&s;t them&s;elves from this fruitful &s;ubject.</P>
<P>THIS day recalls to our grateful remembrance, what we have heard with our ears, and our Fathers have told us concerning the great things our all gra|cious GOD hath done for this land. Our pious ance&s;|tors, on account of the di&s;&s;olutene&s;s of manners and licentiou&s;ne&s;s of the youth, among whom they re&s;ided, "and fearing their po&s;terity through the&s;e temptations and vicious examples would degenerate, and religion die among them; for the &s;ake of purity of wor&s;hip, and liberty of con&s;cience, and from a hope of laying a foundation for the propagation of the kingdom of CHRIST." left all that was dear in their native country, and planted them&s;elves in this then barbarous land.&mdash;From &s;mall beginnings, by a &s;eries of almo&s;t miraculous events, the United States have ari&s;en into an exten&s;ive, flouri&s;hing nation.</P>
<P>AND now, with re&s;pect to our con&s;titutions, laws, and admini&s;tration, civil and religious privileges, and with re&s;pect to our commercial and agricultural intere&s;ts, may it not be affirmed, without an hyperbole, that we are the happie&s;t nation, that has exi&s;ted, &s;ince the morn|ing &s;tars &s;ang together, and the &s;ons of GOD &s;houted for joy at the creation of the world.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="030454_0020_0FE6E28AE50A4108">WHAT gratitude is due to Heaven on this occa&s;ion, for our State and Federal governments, and for the pre|cious privileges and ble&s;&s;ings, we enjoy under them? With what grateful &s;en&s;ations &s;hould we remember that wi&s;e and valiant band of &s;tate&s;men, warriors, and other patriots, who&s;e great exertions have been employed in pulling down the &s;trong holds of tyranny and oppre&s;&s;ion, and in rearing up the pillars of liberty, peace, and pub|lic happine&s;s? To do full ju&s;tice to who&s;e characters, would beggar the power of language. May their me|mories remain indelibly engraver on the heart of every American! But who, O who can render adequate thanks to GOD for WASHINGTON&mdash;who&s;e wi&s;dom, and integrity, firmne&s;s and magnanimity, have excited the a&s;toni&s;hment of the nations of the earth, and added a new wonder to the political world!</P>
<P>WHAT is wanting, to render our national happine&s;s as complete, as the pre&s;ent &s;tate of things will permit, but a ju&s;t e&s;timate of the numerous public ble&s;&s;ings, whereby we are di&s;tingui&s;hed from other nations, due gratitude to Heaven, and an expre&s;&s;ion of this gratitude by a corre&s;pondent behaviour. We ought however, to remember that a &s;tate of pro&s;perity is a &s;tate of dan|ger. It excites envy abroad, and lulls to &s;ecurity at home. It pre&s;ents us a mark for the wiles of tho&s;e, who are well ver&s;ed in intrigue; while our youth and inexperience render us un&s;u&s;picious of their &s;tratagems, and poorly qualify us to detect and defeat them. While we are ju&s;t and faithful in the fulfilment of our engage|ments to all, as free and independent States, may we be proof again&s;t foreign arts, and foreign influence from every quarter.</P>
<P>ON this au&s;picious anniver&s;ary, while many nations are &s;itting in darkne&s;s, others are involved in the horrors of war, &s;truggling for the ble&s;&s;ings we enjoy, and are groaning to be delivered from calamity, to behold our civil fathers, the heads of our tribes, here peaceably a&s;&s;embled to tran&s;act the great affairs of &s;tate, what
<PB N="22" REF="030454_0021_0FE6E28AECD51CA0">
heart does not &s;well with gratitude to Heaven? What tongue is not ready to break forth into a &s;ong of prai&s;e.</P>
<P>HIS Excellency the Governor, his Honor the Lieu|tenant Governor, the honorable the Council, and the honorable the Members of Legi&s;lature, will plea&s;e accept my warme&s;t and mo&s;t re&s;pectful congratulations on this important, joyful occa&s;ion. May Almighty GOD take your Excellency and Honors into his mo&s;t holy protection! Influenced by the be&s;t of principles, the peaceable religion of the Prince of Peace, may wi&s;dom and unanimity attend your conn&s;els and deci|&s;ions; that the people may rejoice and &s;ay, ble&s;&s;ed be the Lord God of I&s;rael, who hath &s;et &s;uch wi&s;e and good men to rule over us. Wherefore let us be &s;ubject, not only for wrath, but for con&s;cience &s;ake.</P>
<P>MAY the various branches of the State and Federal governments, under the influence of the religion of Je|&s;us, each in its proper &s;phere, like the various orbs above, keep their proper places and balances, the one never encroaching upon, or interfering with the other, move on in harmonious rounds till time &s;hall be no more!</P>
<P>IF &s;uch be the importance of morality and religion to the &s;upport of the freedom and happine&s;s of &s;ociety; my much re&s;pected fathers and brethren in the mini&s;try will never be wanting in their exertions to promote re|ligious principles, and the chri&s;tian virtues among the people. I am happy in believing the great body of the Clergy, with a very few exceptions, are firm friends to our State and Federal governments, to our con&s;tituted authorities, to virtue and religion, peace and good or|der among the people. And, if their united exertions and patient &s;ufferings in effecting the American revolu|tion are marks of patrioti&s;m, may they not ju&s;tly lay claim to the title of chri&s;tian patriots? When the divine Saviour commands us to render to Ce&s;ar the things that are Ce&s;ar's, and to God the things that are God's&mdash;When the in&s;pired Paul &s;olemnly charges Titus to put
<PB N="23" REF="030454_0022_0FE6E28F13E4B660">
his hearers in mind to obey magi&s;trates, and to be rea|dy to every good work&mdash;When the in&s;pired Peter &s;o|lemnly exhorts his hearers to &s;ubmit them&s;elves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's &s;ake&mdash;When we hear the in&s;pired Jude denouncing his anathemas again&s;t tho&s;e, who di&s;pi&s;e dominion, and &s;peak evil of dignities; with &s;uch divine commands, and enforcing examples before us, on any great emergency, &s;hould the Clergy &s;how indifference, and not exert their influence to &s;ave their country; might not our divine Lord and Ma&s;ter &s;ay, as in another ca&s;e, I tell you, if the&s;e &s;hould hold their peace, the &s;tones would immediately cry out.&mdash;In every &s;erious danger, on every important cri&s;is, for Zion's &s;ake they will not hold their peace, and for Jeru|salem's &s;ake, they will not re&s;t, until the righteou&s;ne&s;s thereof go forth, as brightne&s;s, and the &s;alvation there|of, as a lamp that burneth. They will plead that God will &s;pare his people, that none among the nations of the earth may &s;ay of America, where is now their God?</P>
<P>IN a word, may the con&s;ideration of the great im|portance of virtue and religion to our public and pri|vate happine&s;s, both pre&s;ent and future, engage every cla&s;s of citizens to cultivate the chri&s;tian temper, and to promote &s;obriety, peace, and good order in every &s;phere of action; that our peace may be as a river, and our righteou&s;ne&s;s, as the waves of the &s;ea! May the holy Spirit of the Lord be poured out upon all the na|tions of the earth; and that kingdom, which con&s;i&s;t|eth in righteou&s;ne&s;s, peace, and joy in the holy Gho&s;t, univer&s;ally prevail! That in&s;tead of wars and blood|&s;hed, Kings may become nur&s;ing Fathers, and Queens nur&s;ing Mothers to the people of God. Then will that ancient prophecy be fulfilled, the kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Chri&s;t, and he &s;hall reign forever aud ever.</P>
