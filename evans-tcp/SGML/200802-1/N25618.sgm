<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS ON FREE MASONRY.</HEAD>
<P>AS you are no &s;tranger, Madam, to my enthu&s;ia&s;tic opinion, that Morpheus is frequently accompanied by &s;ome &s;upernat|ural companion, in his midnight wander|ings, I flatter my&s;elf that you will indulge me with the peru&s;al of one of my moon light excur&s;ions. The ma&s;onic figures can be ex|plained by your re&s;pectable companion, who, from principles of benevolence, will not re|fu&s;e to gratify you; and perhaps, Madam, it may occa&s;ion your becoming a convert to a good opinion of the &s;ublime art.</P>
<P>The dreary &s;ea&s;on, ill health, and a de|pre&s;&s;ion of &s;pirits which unfits me for &s;oci|ciety,
<PB N="4" REF="034027_0003_0FFA2FCEFB244628">
occa&s;ion my devoting a part of my time to dreaming. And what is life, but a dream? Half the world appears to mo&s;t ad|vantage when a&s;leep; and I am one of that number.</P>
<P>The Right Wor&s;hipful Ma&s;ter, after pe|ru&s;ing the enclo&s;ed, (&s;hould he confer upon me that honor) will, with his u&s;ual plea&s;|antry, I expect, a&s;k when I was initiated. I an&s;wer&mdash;At my birth. <HI>Faith, Hope</HI> and <HI>Charity</HI> pre&s;ided: <HI>Wi&s;dom, Strength</HI> and <HI>Beau|ty</HI> refu&s;ed to attend. And, with unu&s;ual care and attention, my three godmothers, ere the dawn of rea&s;on expanded my ideas, laid the foundation of a ma&s;onic &s;tructure, Benevo|lence and Philanthropy, in my brea&s;t. Are there not Miltons at the plough, and State&s;|men in the field? And why not Ma&s;one&s;&s;es at the toilet? If &s;ecrecy in charity, and di&s;|po&s;itions to oblige a neighbor or a friend, are pillars of the Craft, our &s;ex may vie with a Solomon, a Hiram, or the be&s;t ancient or modern ma&s;ter builders, in rai&s;ing them.</P>
<P>The &s;ublime in&s;titution of Ma&s;onry, I fancy, was ordained by the wi&s;e Architect of
<PB N="5" REF="034027_0004_0FFA2FD1F62F9118">
the univer&s;al Lodge, to <HI>level</HI> the ma&s;culine character of the other &s;ex with the feminine &s;oftne&s;s of ours; by <HI>tempering</HI> Courage, For|titude and Gravity, with Candor, Benevo|lence and Charity, and <HI>cementing</HI> them with Friend&s;hip, Sen&s;ibility and Affection. Were our &s;ex admitted into the &s;ociety, it would counteract the grand de&s;ign, as we have gen|erally too great a proportion of tho&s;e delicate feelings, in our compo&s;ition, for our own happine&s;s. The &s;cience of Ma&s;onry, I view as a refined &s;tudy of nature, entirely dive&s;ted of tho&s;e in&s;idious arts, that (from their <HI>&s;ecre|cy, order,</HI> and <HI>&s;igns,</HI> by which the Brethren di&s;cover them&s;elves to each other) many ju|dicious per&s;ons, of both &s;exes, have been led to believe they practi&s;e. It is a &s;cience, that is both u&s;eful and in&s;tructive. It refines the under&s;tanding, &s;oftens the manners, blends together every virtue of the human heart, and teaches us to di&s;tingui&s;h between the fa|vors of fortune, and real merit. Ma&s;onry has been &s;tiled the "Daughter of Heaven, Patrone&s;s of the liberal arts, that poli&s;h and adorn the mind," &amp;c.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="034027_0005_0FFA2FD9B68A14F8">As we naturally e&s;teem our companions, in proportion as they excel us in knowledge, Is it not happy for us, that Ma&s;onry is con|fined to man? Happy, thrice happy, would it have been for her de&s;cendants, if Madam Eve, in&s;tead of ta&s;ting the apple, had po|litely pre&s;ented it to her &s;pou&s;e. This mi&s;|take was never rectified, till the ea&s;tern Mon|arch was in&s;pired with the ideas of building a temple, founding a Lodge, and con&s;ecrat|ing it as &s;acred forever from the old lady's female de&s;cendants. But we enjoy this plea&s;|ing con&s;olation, that it has a tendency to at|tach them to our &s;ex&mdash;"Next to the Deity," &s;ays a Right Wor&s;hipful Ma&s;ter, at the clo&s;e of a charge to his Lodge, "whom can I &s;o properly addre&s;s my&s;elf to, as to the mo&s;t beautiful part of the creation. The &s;anction of the fair is our highe&s;t ambition; to pre|&s;erve it will be our greate&s;t care." And al|though flattery may be termed a foible, (if the Honorable Fraternity will pardon the expre&s;&s;ion) in &s;ome in&s;tances, in this in par|ticular, it appears a virtue. "Honey," &s;ays the proverb, "has caught more flies than

<P>To be &s;erious. A good Ma&s;on may be compared to a re&s;pectable Divine. The lec|tures of the former, and the precepts of the latter, are equally intere&s;ting. One in&s;tructs us in the principles of morality; the other explains the my&s;teries of divinity: Both point to the &s;ame grand view&mdash;the temple of Virtue. The three &s;teps of this noble edifice, Ju&s;tice, Love and Mercy, it is in our power to a&s;cend; and were we clothed with Wi&s;dom, Strength and Beauty, and adorned with Faith and Charity, reclining on Hope, we might extend our pro&s;pect, and, with the aid of three times three, be introduced into the <HI>Royal Arch</HI> of Safety, which would pre&s;erve us from the dangerous &s;hoals and quick&s;ands of folly and di&s;&s;ipation, upon which &s;o many of the vain and thoughtle&s;s, of both &s;exes, &s;uffer &s;hipwreck.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IN con&s;equence of an invitation from one of the members of the Honorable Fraternity, the other evening, to vi&s;it a Lodge, my thoughts were engaged with the &s;ubject of &s;uch a vi&s;it, and I fell into a mo&s;t profound reverie. By the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Mor|pheus, I was conveyed, in a moment, to the <HI>Morning Star</HI>;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The name of the Lodge at Worce&s;ter.</NOTE> the Lodge was <HI>tyled</HI>; the <HI>S&mdash; S&mdash;m,</HI> or court cabinet, was un|locked, and the emblems of the Royal Art properly arranged and di&s;played; the <HI>mur|dered Knight</HI> ro&s;e from the awful &s;ilence of the tomb, and &s;eated him&s;elf upon the left hand of his Royal Ma&s;ter, while his <HI>name
<PB N="10" REF="034027_0009_0FFA2FE4959C68E0">
&s;ake,</HI> to complete the order, &s;at upon his right; the Senior and Junior Grand War|dens, agreeably to their ancient cu&s;tom, were placed in the Ea&s;t and We&s;t; the tapers were eclip&s;ed amid&s;t a blaze of jewels, which were excelled only by the bright luminary of heav|en in meridian &s;plendor. No eloquence can convey an idea of the <HI>beauty, order,</HI> and <HI>har|mony,</HI> which reigned. Like the glory of the apo&s;tle's third heaven, it could not be reveal|ed. They were &s;uch, indeed, as the eye of the uninitiated hath not &s;een, nor hath it entered into the heart of a cowan to con|ceive. But my impatience for information exceeded all bounds. I a&s;ked for the <HI>&s;igns</HI> of the different orders of <HI>entered, pa&s;&s;ed, rai&s;|ed</HI> and <HI>arched.</HI> But I a&s;ked in vain.&mdash;No voice was heard.&mdash;A univer&s;al &s;ilence reign|ed.&mdash;I then began to fancy my&s;elf with the di&s;ciples of Pythagoras, or that the grand &s;ecret of Ma&s;onry was to become &s;peechle&s;s.</P>
<P>After admiring their prudence in exclud|ing females, (for it would be &s;carcely po&s;&s;ible for the different &s;exes to a&s;&s;emble and keep &s;ilence, even in heaven, for half an hour,) I
<PB N="11" REF="034027_0010_0FFA2FE9E4836D68">
acknowledge I began to fancy a &s;ilent heav|en no heaven for me; and meditated an e&s;|cape: When, lo!&mdash;
<Q><L>Sacred to heaven, behold, the dome appears,</L>
<L>See what augu&s;t &s;olemnity it wears!</L></Q>
In a moment, as if by enchantment, appear|ed a beautiful fabric, who&s;e ba&s;e was Benev|olence, and who&s;e &s;trength was Peace and Harmony. The <HI>Plumbline, Square</HI> and <HI>Com|pa&s;&s;es,</HI> were placed upon the <HI>Tre&s;&s;el Board,</HI> as emblems of the proportion of the de&s;ign. On a beautiful column &s;at <HI>Faith, Hope</HI> and <HI>Charity,</HI> viewing Misfortune. On another reclined <HI>Wi&s;dom, Strength</HI> and <HI>Beauty,</HI> ca&s;t|ing a benignant &s;mile upon tho&s;e benefac|tors of mankind. Here, regardle&s;s of the awful &s;ilence that reigned, I exclaimed with the Oratorio,
<Q><L>Angels them&s;elves have deign'd to deck the frame,</L>
<L>Behold they come upon the wings of light,</L>
<L>And with their &s;hining ve&s;tments cheer the &s;ight.</L>
<L>To heaven's high Architect all prai&s;e,</L>
<L>All gratitude be given,</L>
<L>Who deign'd the human &s;oul to rai&s;e,</L>
<L>By &s;ecrets &s;prung from heaven.</L></Q></P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="034027_0011_0FFA2FC3036B80E8">I was proceeding in this rapturous &s;train, when Phoebus, who had ju&s;t mounted his golden car, di&s;played his &s;plendid rays upon my pillow, and I awoke, as much confu&s;ed in my ideas, perhaps, as an entered Appren|tice, when ju&s;t introduced from darkne&s;s into light; but with the plea&s;ing con&s;ola|tion, that I was not intru&s;ted with tho&s;e profound &s;ecrets, &s;o e&s;&s;ential to pre&s;erve the art.</P>
