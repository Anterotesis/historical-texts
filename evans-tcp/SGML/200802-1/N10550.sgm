<P>AUTHORISED by a divine precept, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Exodus 34.22.</NOTE> and excited by the feelings of gratitude, the inhabitants of the&s;e northern provinces, have made it their con&s;tant practice, to meet in their religious a&s;&s;emblies, at the clo&s;e of the year, and devoutly offer unto the LORD, their &s;acrifice of prai&s;e and thank&s;giving.</P>
<P>WHEN the fruits of the earth are gathered in, and we are furni&s;hed with provi&s;ions for an expen|&s;ive winter &s;ea&s;on, nothing can be more proper, than for a people profe&s;&s;ing godline&s;s, to unite in paying their thankful acknowledgments to the father of the univer&s;e, for the expre&s;&s;ions of his goodne&s;s.&mdash;And we rejoice, that the repre&s;enta+tives of this Province, who, in the pre&s;ent di&s;|tracted &s;tate of our public affairs, have been con|&s;ulting the mo&s;t proper ways to <HI>recover</HI> and <HI>&s;ecure</HI> our invaded liberties, were not unmindful of the
<PB N="6" REF="013370_0004_0F90571AC8F793F8">
ble&s;&s;ings we receive from GOD almighty; but have invited us to ob&s;erve <HI>this</HI> as a day of general thank&s;giving.</P>
<P>BUT although we have much rea&s;on to ble&s;s the Lord, for the many expre&s;&s;ions of his goodne&s;s, through the cour&s;e of the la&s;t year, it is proper, e|ven on this day of fe&s;tivity,
<Q>to humble our&s;elves before GOD, on account of tho&s;e &s;ins, for which he hath &s;uffered our pre&s;ent calamities to come upon us, and implore the divine ble&s;&s;ing, that by the a&s;&s;i&s;tances of his grace, we may be ena|bled to reform whatever is ami&s;s, that &s;o GOD may be plea&s;ed to continue to us the ble&s;&s;ings we enjoy, and remove the tokens of his di&s;plea|&s;ure.</Q> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the recommendation from the Provential Congre&s;s, for a day of thank&s;giving.</NOTE></P>
<P>THE exerci&s;es of this day, will therefore be different from what have been u&s;ual; and I could think of no pa&s;&s;age of &s;cripture, more &s;uitable to place at the head of a di&s;cour&s;e, in which we are to have re&s;pect, both to the ble&s;&s;ings of divine pro|vidence, and the public calamities which have be|fallen us, than the words of David, which have now been read.</P>
<P>A celebrated commentator on the text, has the following ob&s;ervations:&mdash;
<Q>When GOD in his providence exerci&s;eth us with a mixture of Mercy and Judgment, it is our duty to &s;ing, and &s;ing unto him both of the one and the other: We mu&s;t be &s;uitably affected with both, and make &s;uitable acknowledgments of both.</Q>

<P>LET me then a&s;k your attention, while I men|tion &s;ome of the ble&s;&s;ings which GOD is plea&s;ed to be&s;tow upon us; and take notice of the prin|cipal calamities, which, in righteous Judgment, he has &s;uffered to befal us.</P>
<P>YOU will be &s;en&s;ible, the time allowed the prea|cher on a day of thank&s;giving, will not admit of an exact enumeration, either of the Ble&s;&s;ings be|&s;towed upon us, or the calamities under which we &s;uffer; we mu&s;t therefore confine our attention to tho&s;e which are confe&s;&s;edly of the mo&s;t impor|tance: But &s;hould I a little exceed the limits com|monly ob&s;erved on the&s;e Occa&s;ions, the nature of the &s;ubject, I hope, will be an apology for me.</P>
<P>ALL who profe&s;s their belief of the holy Scrip|tures, will be free to acknowledge, the mercy of God revealed in the go&s;pel, demands our fir&s;t, our principle attention.</P>
<P>SUCH is the darkne&s;s of the human mind, that had not the children of men, been favoured with the light of divine truth, they would never have found the way to glory.

<P>THE mercy of GOD revealed to a guilty World, in the gift of his Son Je&s;us Chri&s;t, will claim an e|verla&s;ting tribute of Prai&s;e.&mdash;How deplorable would our condition have been, had the author of our exi&s;tence, &s;een fit to leave us to the power of tho&s;e lu&s;ts, which war again&s;t the Soul.&mdash; <NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Iames 4.<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">.</NOTE> Satan, the enemy of all good, was able to &s;educe our once innocent parents from their loyalty, and render them obnoxious to the wrath of their creator.&mdash; And had not Je&s;us Chri&s;t who is &s;tronger than the &s;trong man armed, and is able to &s;ubdue all things to him&s;elf, <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Phillip. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">.21.</NOTE> undertaken the work of redemption, none of our guilty race, could have entertained a hope of future happine&s;s, or even of life from the dead.</P>

<Q>The be&s;t di&s;tinction I know between <HI>e&s;tabli&s;hment</HI> and <HI>toleration</HI> is, that the greater number has a right to the <HI>one,</HI> and the le&s;&s;er to the <HI>other.</HI> The public maintenance of a clergy is inherent to <HI>e&s;tabli&s;hment</HI>; at the reformation, therefore, as much of the church e&s;tates as were thought nece&s;&s;ary for its &s;up|port were transferred to the prote&s;tant church, as by law e&s;tabli&s;hed. Surely then when the free exerci&s;e of the national religion was given to the Canadian nation, it could never be under&s;tood that they were to be deprived of their clergy&punc; and if not, a national provi&s;ion for that clergy followes of cour&s;e.</Q>
&mdash;What we have here quo|ted from his LORDSHIP's Letter, is &s;ufficient to &s;hew, that he not only con&s;idered the Canada Act as e&s;tabli&s;hing the Roman catholic religion in that country, but that he &s;uppo&s;ed the Briti&s;h Legi&s;lature, acted a wi&s;e and equita|ble part in &s;o doing.&mdash;But his LORDSHIP's rea&s;oning does not carry with it the <HI>fulle&s;t</HI> conviction.&mdash; Suppo&s;e, by a &s;trange <HI>je&s;uitical</HI> influence, in &s;ome future period, more than one half the inhabitants of Great-Bri|tain &s;hould be converted to the Roman catholic religion, would the legi&s;lature be bound in duty to <HI>e&s;tabli&s;h</HI> that religion, and only <HI>tolerate</HI> Prote&s;tants?&mdash;It mu&s;t be &s;o, it &s;eems, if the be&s;t di&s;tinction between <HI>e&s;tabli&s;hment</HI> and <HI>to|leration</HI> is, that the greater number has a <HI>right</HI> to the one, and the le&s;&s;er to the other.</P>
<P>Wi&s;e legi&s;lative bodies, will examine the nature and doctrines of a religion, before they favour it with an <HI>e&s;tabli&s;hment</HI>; If they find the doctrines of any religion are contrary to the holy Scriptures, and are per&s;uaded that it is, in its na|ture, unfriendly to the &s;afety and happine&s;s of the com|munity, certainly they will not <HI>e&s;tabli&s;h</HI> it, although, <HI>the greater number,</HI> (of the community) may, at pre&s;ent, be fond of it.&mdash;</P>
<P>Let us hear what the learned and pious BISHOP BURNET has &s;aid of roman catholics, and their religion.&mdash;
<Q>It is certain, that as all Papi&s;ts mu&s;t, at all times, be <HI>ill</HI> &s;ub|jects to a prote&s;tant Prince, &s;o that is much more to be apprehended, when there is a pretended Popi&s;h <HI>heir</HI> in the ca&s;e.</Q>
&mdash;
<Q>Learn to view popery in a true light, as a con&s;piracy to exalt the power of the clergy, even by &s;ubjecting the mo&s;t &s;acred truths of religion to contri|vances for rai&s;ing their authority, and by offering to the world <HI>another method of being &s;aved, be&s;ides that pre&s;cribed in the go&s;pel.</HI>&mdash; Popery is a ma&s;s of impo&s;tures, &s;uppor|ted by men, who manage them with great <HI>advantages,</HI> and impo&s;e them with inexpre&s;&s;ible <HI>&s;everities,</HI> on tho&s;e who dare call any thing in que&s;tion that they dictate to them.</Q></P>
<BIBL>BISHOP BURNET's <HI>Hi&s;tory of his own times.</HI></BIBL>
<P>If the roman catholic religion is what the good Bi&s;hop has here declared, is it not a&s;toni&s;hing, that any <HI>Prote&s;tant</HI> can plead for its <HI>e&s;tabli&s;hment!</HI> For a Briti&s;h legi&s;lature to <HI>tolerate</HI> &s;uch a religion, is as much, one would think, as they could do con&s;i&s;tent with their duty to GOD, and to that con&s;titution of civil government, which they are bound to maintain.&mdash;</P>
<P>It may be &s;aid a religion is e&s;tabli&s;hed, where there are laws for the &s;upport of it.&mdash;Thus is the church of England e&s;ta|bli&s;hed in a great part of the Briti&s;h dominions.&mdash;Thus are the congregational order and di&s;cipline e&s;tabli&s;hed in this Province, and thus is the roman catholic religion e&s;ta|bli&s;hed in Canada.</P></NOTE></P>
