<P>Concerning which &s;ome farther arrangement is nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>The greate&s;t part of the regi&s;tered debt, hitherto un&s;ub&s;cribed, is owned by the citizens of foreign countries, mo&s;t, if not all of whom appear now di&s;po&s;ed to embrace the terms held out by the act above mentioned; exten&s;ive orders having been received from tho&s;e creditors, to &s;ub&s;cribe to the loan, after the time for receiving &s;ub&s;criptions had elap&s;ed.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="024926_0004_0FCD8E6D7AED2CB0">
A con&s;iderable part of the out&s;tanding or floating debt, con&s;i&s;ts of loan-office certificates i&s;&s;ued between the fir&s;t of September, 1777, and the fir&s;t of March, 1778, bearing intere&s;t on the nominal &s;um. Many of the holders of this &s;pecies of debt have come in upon the terms of the act, but others have hitherto declined it; alledging, that the &s;pecial nature of their contract gives a peculiarity to their ca&s;e, and renders the commutation propo&s;ed not &s;o fair an equivalent to them, as in other in&s;tances. They al&s;o complain, that the act has had, towards them, a compul&s;ory a&s;pect, by refu&s;ing the temporary payment of intere&s;t, unle&s;s they &s;hould exchange their old for new certificates, e&s;&s;entially varying the nature of their contract.</P>
<P>A re&s;olution of Congre&s;s of the tenth of September, 1777, &s;tipulates in fa|vour of this cla&s;s of creditors, intere&s;t upon the <HI>nominal,</HI> in&s;tead of the <HI>real principal</HI> of their debt, <HI>until that principal be di&s;charged.</HI> This certainly renders their contract of a nature more beneficial than that of other creditors; but they are at the &s;ame time liable to be dive&s;ted of the extra-benefit it gives them, by a payment of their &s;pecie-dues; and it may be ob&s;erved, that they have actu|ally enjoyed, and by accepting the terms offered to them, were enabled to reali&s;e, advantages &s;uperior to other creditors. They have been paid intere&s;t by bills on France from the tenth of September, 1777, to the fir&s;t of March, 1782, while other creditors received their intere&s;t in depreciated bills of the old emi&s;&s;ions; and the terms of the loan propo&s;ed put it in their power to reali&s;e the benefit of intere&s;t on the nominal amount of their re&s;pective debts, at rates from 6 10/100, nearly to 10 47/100 per cent. on their real or &s;pecie capital down to the la&s;t of December, 1790.</P>
<P>It does not therefore appear to have been an unrea&s;onable expectation, that they, as readily as any other de&s;cription of public creditors, would have ac|quie&s;ced in a mea&s;ure, calculated for the accommodation of the government, under circum&s;tances, in re&s;pect to which, it has been demon&s;trated by <HI>&s;ub&s;equent events</HI> that the accommodation de&s;ired was con&s;i&s;tent with the be&s;t intere&s;t of the public creditors. A large proportion of the parties intere&s;ted have indeed view|ed the matter in this light, and have embraced the propo&s;ition. It is probable, that the <HI>progre&s;s</HI> of things will &s;atisfy the remainder, that it is equally their in|tere&s;t to concur; if a farther opportunity be afforded. But it is, neverthele&s;s, for them&s;elves only to judge, how far the equivalent propo&s;ed is, in their ca&s;e, a rea&s;onable and fair one; how far any circum&s;tances in their claim may &s;ug|ge&s;t rea&s;ons for moderation on their part; or how far any other motives, pub|lic or private, ought to induce an acceptance. And the principles of good faith require, that their election &s;hould be free.</P>
<P>On this ground, the complaint which regards the withholding of a tempo|rary payment of intere&s;t, except on the condition of a &s;urrender of the old cer|tificates for new ones importing a contract &s;ub&s;tantially different, appears to the Secretary not de&s;titute of foundation. He pre&s;umes, that the operation of that provi&s;ion, in the particular ca&s;e was not adverted to; or, that an ex|ception would have been introduced as mo&s;t con&s;onant with the general &s;pirit and de&s;ign of the act. Accordingly the farther mea&s;ures which will be &s;ubmit|ted, will contemplate a method of obviating the objection in que&s;tion.</P>
<P>From the con&s;ideration, that an exten&s;ion of the time for receiving &s;ub&s;crip|tions, upon the terms of the act making provi&s;ion for the debt of the United States, is de&s;ired by a large proportion of the non-&s;ub&s;cribing creditors; and from the farther con&s;ideration, that &s;ufficient experience has not yet been had of the productivene&s;s of a con&s;iderable branch of the revenues which have been e&s;tabli&s;hed, to afford the light nece&s;&s;ary to a final arrangement&mdash;it is, in the judgment of the Secretary, advi&s;eable, to renew the propo&s;ition for a loan in the dome&s;tic debt, on the &s;ame terms with the one which has been clo&s;ed, and
<PB N="7" REF="024926_0005_0FCD8E70729F2310">
to allow time for receiving &s;ub&s;criptions to it until the la&s;t day of September next, inclu&s;ively; making provi&s;ion for the temporary payment of intere&s;t to &s;uch who may not think fit to &s;ub&s;cribe, for the year 1792, of the like nature with that which was made in the &s;ame ca&s;e for the year 1791&mdash;except as to the holders of loan-office certificates, i&s;&s;ued between the fir&s;t of September, 1777, and the fir&s;t of March, 1778; in re&s;pect to whom it is &s;ubmitted as pro|per to di&s;pen&s;e with the obligation of exchanging their old certificates for new, as the condition of their receiving intere&s;t in capacity of non-&s;ub&s;cribers; and to allow them, without &s;uch exchange, to receive the &s;ame intere&s;t, both for the years 1791 and 1792, as if they had &s;ub&s;cribed to the fir&s;t loan. It will not be materially difficult, &s;o to regulate the operation at the trea&s;ury as to avoid in the particular ca&s;e, that danger of impo&s;ition by counterfeits, which was the motive to the general provi&s;ion for an exchange of certificates.</P>
<P>II. The amount of the &s;ub&s;criptions in the debts of the re&s;pective &s;tates, within the limits of the &s;um a&s;&s;umed in each, appears by the &s;tatement marked D. to be dollars 17,072,334 39/100 &s;ubject to the ob&s;ervations accompanying that &s;tatement. Con&s;equently the difference between the aggregate of the &s;ums &s;ub&s;cribed, and the aggregate of the &s;ums a&s;&s;umed, is <HI>dols.</HI> 4,427,665 61/100</P>
<P>This difference is to be attributed to &s;everal cau&s;es, the principal of which are the following. Fir&s;t, That the &s;ums a&s;&s;umed in re&s;pect to certain &s;tates exceeded the actual amount of their exi&s;ting debts. Second, That in various in&s;tances, a part of the exi&s;ting debt was in a form which excluded it from be|ing received, without contravening particular provi&s;ions of the law; as in the ca&s;e of certificates i&s;&s;ued after the fir&s;t day of January, 1790, in lieu of certifi|cates which had been i&s;&s;ued prior to that period, which was reported upon by the Secretary on the twenty-fifth day of February la&s;t. Third, Ignorance of, or inattention to the limitation of time for receiving &s;ub&s;criptions. It appears, that a number of per&s;ons lo&s;t the opportunity of &s;ub&s;cribing from the one or the other of the&s;e cau&s;es.</P>
<P>A &s;trong de&s;ire that a farther opportunity may be afforded for &s;ub&s;criptions in the debts of the &s;tates, has been manife&s;ted by the individuals intere&s;ted. And the &s;tates of Rhode-I&s;land and New-Hamp&s;hire, have, by the public acts referred to the Secretary, indicated a &s;imilar de&s;ire. The affording of &s;uch farther opportunity, may either be re&s;tricted within the limit, as to amount, which is contemplated by the act it&s;elf, or may receive an exten&s;ion which will embrace the re&s;iduary debts of the &s;tates.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t may be con&s;idered as nothing more than giving full effect to a mea|&s;ure already adopted.</P>
<P>The la&s;t appears to have in its favour all the leading inducements to what has been already done. The embarra&s;&s;ments which might ari&s;e from conflict|ing &s;y&s;tems of finance are not entirely obviated. The efficacious command of the national re&s;ources for national exigencies, is not unequivocally &s;ecured. The equalizing of the condition of the citizens of every &s;tate, and exonerating tho&s;e of the &s;tates mo&s;t indebted, from partial burthens which would pre&s;s up|on them in con&s;equence of exertions in a common cau&s;e, is not completely ful|filled, until the entire debt of every &s;tae, contracted in relation to the war, is embraced in one general and comprehen&s;ive plan. The inconvenience to the United States of di&s;burthening the &s;tates, which are &s;till encumbered with con&s;iderable debts, would bear no proportion to the inconvenience which they would feel, if left to &s;truggle with tho&s;e debts, unaided.</P>
<P>More general contentment, therefore, in the public mind, may be expected to attend &s;uch an exonoration, than the rever&s;e; in proportion as the expe|rience of actual inconvenience would be greater, though only applicable to parts, in the one than in the other ca&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="024926_0006_0FCD8E722D8E8190">
With regard to &s;tates, parts only of the debts of which have been a&s;&s;umed, and in proportions &s;hort of tho&s;e, which have prevailed, in favour of other &s;tates, and &s;hort al&s;o of what would have re&s;ulted from a due apportionment of the entire &s;um a&s;&s;umed; the claim to a further a&s;&s;umption is founded on con&s;iderations of equal ju&s;tice, as relative to the mea&s;ure it&s;elf, con&s;idered in a &s;eparate and independent light.</P>
<P>But there is a further rea&s;on of material weight for an immediate general a&s;&s;umption. Monied men, as well foreigners as citizens, through the expecta|tion of an eventual a&s;&s;umption, or that in &s;ome &s;hape or other a &s;ub&s;tantial pro|vi&s;ion will be made for the una&s;&s;umed re&s;idue of the &s;tate debts, will be induc|ed to &s;peculate in the purcha&s;e of them. In proportion as the event is un&s;et|tled, or uncertain, the price of the article will be low, and the pre&s;ent propri|etors will be under di&s;advantage in the &s;ale. The lo&s;s to them in favour of the purcha&s;ers is to be regarded as an evil; and as far as it is connected with a transfer to foreigners, at an undervalue, it will be a national evil. By what|&s;oever authority an ultimate provi&s;ion may be made, there will be an ab&s;olute lo&s;s to the community equal to the total amount of &s;uch undervalue.</P>
<P>It may appear an objection to the mea&s;ure, that it will require an e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of additional funds by the government of the United States. But this does not &s;eem to be a nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence. The probability is, that without a &s;upplementary a&s;&s;umption, an equal, or very nearly equal augmentation of funds will be requi&s;ite to provide for <HI>greater</HI> balances in favour of certain &s;tates, which would be proportionably dimini&s;hed by &s;uch a&s;&s;umption. The de&s;tina|tion, not the quantum of the fund, will therefore be the chief di&s;tinction between the two ca&s;es.</P>
<P>It may al&s;o appear an objection to a total a&s;&s;umption, that the magnitude of the object is not a&s;certained with preci&s;ion. It is not certainly known, what &s;um is due in each &s;tate; nor has it been po&s;&s;ible to acquire the information, owing to different cau&s;es. But though preci&s;e data are deficient, there are materials which will &s;erve as guides. From the returns received at the trea|&s;ury, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by information in other ways, it may be &s;tated without danger of material error&mdash;That the remaining debts of the &s;tates over and above the &s;ums already &s;ub&s;cribed will not exceed the amounts &s;pecified in the &s;tatement D. ac|companying this report&mdash;And that, including the &s;ums already &s;ub&s;cribed, the total amount to be <HI>ultimately</HI> provided for, in the event of a general a&s;&s;umption, will not exceed 25,403,362 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">/100 dollars, which would con&s;titute an addition of 3,903,362, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">1/100 dollars, to the &s;um of 21,500,000 dollars already a&s;&s;umed.</P>
<P>Should a total a&s;&s;umption be deemed eligible, it may &s;till be advi&s;eable to a&s;&s;ign a determinate &s;um for each &s;tate, that the utmo&s;t limit of the operation may be pre-e&s;tabli&s;hed; and it is nece&s;&s;ary in order to the certainty of a due provi&s;ion in proper time, that intere&s;t &s;hould not begin to be payable, on the additional &s;ums a&s;&s;umed, till after the year 1792.</P>
<P>It will occur, that provi&s;ion has been made, for paying to each &s;tate, in tru&s;t for its non-&s;ub&s;cribing creditors, an intere&s;t upon the difference between the &s;um a&s;&s;umed for &s;uch &s;tate, and that actually &s;ub&s;cribed, equal to what would have been payable, if it had been &s;ub&s;cribed.</P>
<P>In the event of a farther a&s;&s;umption, either within the limits already e&s;ta|bli&s;hed, or commen&s;urate with the remaining debts of the &s;tates; it is con|ceived, that it will not be incompatible with the provi&s;ion ju&s;t mentioned, to retain, at the end of each quarter, during the progre&s;s of the farther &s;ub&s;crip|tion, out of the money directed to be paid to each &s;tate, a &s;um corre&s;ponding with the intere&s;t upon &s;o much of its debts as &s;hall have been &s;ub&s;cribed to that period, paying the overplus, if any, to the &s;tate. An ab&s;olute &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of that payment does not appear con&s;i&s;tent with the nature of the &s;tipulation, in|cluded
<PB N="9" REF="024926_0007_0FCD8E737AD61E58">
in that provi&s;ion; for though the money to be paid to a &s;tate be ex|pre&s;sly a tru&s;t for the non-&s;ub&s;cribing creditors; yet as it cannot be certain beforehand, that they will elect to change their condition, the po&s;&s;ibility of it will not ju&s;tify a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of payment to the &s;tate, which might operate as a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of payment to the creditors them&s;elves.</P>
<P>A farther objection to &s;uch a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion re&s;ults from the idea, that the pro|vi&s;ion in que&s;tion appears to have a &s;econdary object; namely, as a pledge for &s;ecuring a provi&s;ion for whatever balance may be found due to a &s;tate on the general &s;ettlement of accounts. The payment directed to be made to a &s;tate, is "to continue <HI>until</HI> there &s;hall be a &s;ettlement of accounts between the Uni|ted States and the individual &s;tates; and inca&s;e a balance &s;hould then appear in favour of a &s;tate, <HI>until</HI> provi&s;ion &s;hall be made for the &s;aid balance."</P>
<P>This &s;econdary operation as a pledge or &s;ecurity (con&s;i&s;tently with the intent of the funding act) can only be &s;uper&s;eded in favour of the primary object, a <HI>provi&s;ion for the creditors;</HI> and as far as may be nece&s;&s;ary to admit them to an effectual participation of it. But as whatever money may be paid to a &s;tate, is to be paid over to its creditors, proportional deductions may, with propriety, be made from the debts of tho&s;e creditors who may hereafter &s;ub&s;cribe; &s;o as that the United States may not have to pay twice for the &s;ame purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>If it &s;hall be judged expedient, either to open again, or extend the a&s;&s;ump|tion, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to vary the de&s;cription of the debts, which may be &s;ub&s;cribed, &s;o as to comprehend all tho&s;e, which have relation to &s;ervices or &s;upplies during the war, under &s;uch re&s;trictions as are requi&s;ite to guard again&s;t abu&s;e.</P>
<P>In the original propo&s;ition for an a&s;&s;umption of the &s;tate debts, and in the &s;ugge&s;tions now made on the &s;ame &s;ubject, the Secretary has contemplated, and &s;till contemplates, as a material part of the plan, an effectual provi&s;ion, for the &s;ale of the vacant lands of the United States. He has con&s;idered this re|&s;ource, as an important mean of &s;inking a part of the debt, and facilitating ulti|mate arrangements concerning the re&s;idue. If &s;upplementary funds &s;hall be rendered nece&s;&s;ary, by an additional a&s;&s;umption, the provi&s;ion will mo&s;t conve|niently be made, at the next &s;e&s;&s;ion of Congre&s;s, when the productivene&s;s of the exi&s;ting revenues, and the extent of the &s;um to be provided for, will be better a&s;certained.</P>
<P>There is a part of the public debt of the United States, which is a cau&s;e of &s;ome perplexity to the trea&s;ury. It is not comprehended within the exi&s;t|ing provi&s;ion for the foreign debt which is confined to <HI>loans</HI> made abroad; and it is que&s;tionable, whether it is to be regarded as a portion of the dome&s;tic debt. It is not only due to <HI>foreigners,</HI> but the intere&s;t upon it is payable, by expre&s;s &s;tipulation, in a foreign country, whence it becomes a matter of doubt, whether it be at all contemplated by the act making provi&s;ion for the debt of the United States. The part alluded to is that, which is due to certain foreign officers, who &s;erved the United States during the late war. In con&s;equence of a re&s;olution of Congre&s;s, directing their intere&s;t to be paid to them in France, the certificates which were i&s;&s;ued to them &s;pecify, that "in pur&s;uance of and compliance with a certain re&s;olution of Congre&s;s of the third day of February 1784, the &s;aid intere&s;t is to be paid, annually, at the hou&s;e of Mon&s;. le Grand, banker in Paris." Intere&s;t has accordingly been paid to them at Paris, down to the 31&s;t of December 1788, by virtue of a &s;pecial re&s;olution of Congre&s;s of the 20th of Augu&s;t in that year; &s;ince which period, no payment has been made.</P>
<P>It has been heretofore &s;ugge&s;ted as the opinion of the Secretary, that it would be expedient to cau&s;e the whole of this de&s;cription of debt to be paid off; among other rea&s;ons, becau&s;e it bears an intere&s;t at &s;ix per centum per annum,
<PB N="10" REF="024926_0008_0FCD8E756F5589D8">
payable abroad, and can be di&s;charged with a &s;aving. The other rea&s;ons al|luded to are of a nature both weighty and delicate, and too obvious, it is pre|&s;umed, to need a &s;pecification. Some recent circum&s;tances have &s;erved to &s;trengthen the inducements to the mea&s;ure. But if it &s;hould, finally, be deemed unadvi&s;eable, it is nece&s;&s;ary at lea&s;t, that provi&s;ion &s;hould be made for the inte|re&s;t, which is now &s;u&s;pended, under the doubt that has been &s;tated, and from the want of authority to <HI>remit</HI> it pur&s;uant to the contract.</P>
<P>The amount of this debt, with the arrears of intere&s;t to the end of the year 1791, is <HI>Dollars</HI> 220,646. 81</P>
<P>IV. The act making provi&s;ion for the debt of the United States has ap|propriated the proceeds of the we&s;tern lands as a fund for the di&s;charge of the public debt. And the act making provi&s;ion for the reduction of the public debt, has appropriated all the &s;urplus of the duties on imports and tonnage, to the end of the year 1790, to the purpo&s;e of purcha&s;ing the debt at the market price, and has authori&s;ed the Pre&s;ident to borrow the further &s;um of two mil|lions of dollars for the &s;ame object.</P>
<P>The&s;e mea&s;ures &s;erve to indicate the intention of the legi&s;lature, as early and as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible, to provide for the extingui&s;hment of the exi&s;ting debt.</P>
<P>In pur&s;uance of that intention, it appears advi&s;eable, that a &s;y&s;tematic plan &s;hould be begun for the creation and e&s;tabli&s;hment of a &s;inking fund.</P>
<P>An obvious ba&s;is of this e&s;tabli&s;hment, which may be immediately contem|plated, is the amount of the intere&s;t on &s;o much of the debt as has been or &s;hall be, from time to time, purcha&s;ed, or paid off, or received in di&s;charge of any debt or demand of the United States, made payable in public &s;ecurities&mdash;over and above the intere&s;t of any new debt, which may be created, in order to &s;uch purcha&s;e or payment.</P>
<P>The purcha&s;es of the debt already made have left a &s;um of intere&s;t in the Trea&s;ury, which will be encrea&s;ed by future purcha&s;es&mdash;certain &s;ums payable to the United States in their own &s;ecurities, will, when received, have a &s;imilar effect. And there is ground to calculate on a &s;aving upon the operations, which are in execution with regard to the foreign debt. The &s;ale of the We&s;tern Lands, when provi&s;ion &s;hall be made for it, may be expected to pro|duce a material addition to &s;uch a fund.</P>
<P>It is therefore &s;ubmitted, that it be adopted as a principle, that all intere&s;t which &s;hall have cea&s;ed to be payable, by any of the means above &s;pecified, &s;hall be &s;et apart and appropriated in the mo&s;t firm and inviolable manner, as a fund for &s;inking the public debt, by purcha&s;e or payment; and that the &s;aid fund be placed under the direction of the officers named in the &s;econd &s;ection of the act making provi&s;ion for the reduction of the public debt, to be by them applied towards the purcha&s;e of the &s;aid debt, until the annual produce of the &s;aid fund &s;hall amount to two per cent. of the entire portion of the debt which bears a pre&s;ent intere&s;t of &s;ix per centum, and thenceforth to be applied, towards the redemption of that portion of the debt, according to the right which has been re&s;erved to the government.</P>
<P>It will de&s;erve the con&s;ideration of the Legi&s;lature, whether this fund ought not to be &s;o ve&s;ted, as to acquire the nature and quality of a <HI>proprietary</HI> tru&s;t, incapable of being diverted, without a violation of the principles and &s;anctions of <HI>property.</HI></P>
<P>A rapid accumulation of this fund would ari&s;e from its own operation; but it is not doubted, that the progre&s;&s;ive developement of the re&s;ources of the country, and a reduction of the rate of intere&s;t, by the progre&s;s of public credit, already exemplified in a con&s;iderable degree, will &s;peedily enable the government to make important additions to it, in various ways. With due
<PB N="11" REF="024926_0009_0FCD8E771806DD18">
attention to pre&s;erve order and cultivate peace, a &s;trong expectation may be indulged, that a reduction of the debt of the country will keep pace with the rea&s;onable hopes of its citizens.</P>

<P>NOTE.&mdash;The balance above &s;tated to be out&s;tanding probably exceeds the real &s;um. In the original e&s;timate the old emi&s;&s;ion bills were computed at 40 for 1, but they have been provided for at 100 for 1. There are al&s;o loan-of|fice certificates which were &s;ent to public officers to be applied to the public &s;ervice, and which were &s;uppo&s;ed to have been &s;o applied, but which have &s;ince, upon &s;ettlements of their accounts at the Trea&s;ury, been returned and cancelled.</P>
<P>In addition to this, payments in public &s;ecurities are expected to be made into the Trea&s;ury, which will thereupon be cancelled. And it is pre&s;umable that in the cour&s;e of the war, &s;ums have been lo&s;t and de&s;troyed which are in|cluded in the e&s;timate. But as there is &s;ome arrearage of intere&s;t not included in the calculation, and as there are certain claims on the Trea&s;ury, the event or amount of which is not yet determined, it is not po&s;&s;ible <HI>now</HI> to make a preci&s;e e&s;timate of the difference between the &s;um computed to be out&s;tand|ing and what will be really found &s;o.</P>

<P>I. The &s;ums marked <HI>(a)</HI> in the column of remaining debts are in&s;erted upon recent official communications.</P>
<P>II. Tho&s;e marked <HI>(b)</HI> are founded upon official &s;tatements &s;ome time &s;ince received, and reported to the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives on the 9th of January, 1790, adding intere&s;t for the &s;ub&s;equent period.</P>
<P>III. Tho&s;e marked <HI>(c)</HI> are founded on informal information, but &s;uch as is deemed &s;ub&s;tantially authentic and accurate. The e&s;timate for Rhode-I&s;land includes a &s;um not a&s;certained, which has been cancelled in con&s;equence of former laws of the &s;tate, enjoining the creditors to bring in their certificates and receive payment in paper-money, but has been revived by a late law of the State, directing the &s;ums paid to be liquidated according to a certain &s;cale, and deducted from the original amount.</P>
<P>IV. That marked <HI>(d)</HI> is founded on a report of a committee of the 11th November, 1791, to the Hou&s;e of Delegates of Virginia, compared with a former return to the Trea&s;ury and other information.</P>
<P>V. That marked <HI>(e)</HI> is founded upon a &s;tatement of the Comptroller of North-Carolina, of May 20th, 1790.</P>
<P>VI. That marked <HI>(f)</HI> is founded on a &s;tatement of the Trea&s;urer of Georgia of the 30th of April, 1790, compared with other information.</P>
<P>VII. The &s;ums expre&s;&s;ed in round numbers are not meant to be under&s;tood as preci&s;ely accurate, but as very near the truth.</P>
<P>VIII. The foreign as well as the dome&s;tic debt of the States is included.</P>
