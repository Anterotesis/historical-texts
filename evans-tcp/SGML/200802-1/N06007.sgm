in every thinking Man, good Chri&s;tian, and loyal Subject, &s;erious, and enquiring Tho'ts what the&s;e Di&s;pen&s;ations calls us to; what we have to do, and what may be&s;t be done, to &s;ecure our&s;elves again&s;t tho&s;e threatning Dangers, and Inva&s;ions of our Enemies; which &s;eems to put every Thing that is dear to us at &s;take; not only the Property of the Country, and our Enjoyments in it; but al&s;o our Liberties, Privileges, and the holy Religion we are ble&s;&s;ed with; and when this is the general Concern and Enquiry in &s;uch a critical Day, where can we better go for Direction than to the &s;acred Oracles of GOD, which offer the be&s;t Directions in all Ca&s;es, and Light in the darke&s;t Times. And if we enquire at the Divine <HI>Oracles</HI> we &s;hall find our&s;elves directed to look to GOD, and &s;eek his Face, and Favour, Pre&s;ence, and Ble&s;&s;ing, as the be&s;t, and only &s;ure Way for Deliverance from Dangers &amp; Troubles, &amp; for Protection, and Safety at all Times.

People, and the wonderful &s;pecial Care he takes of them; who keeps them as the Ap|ple of his Eye, who is Afflicted, in all their Afflictions, and ready to their help in every time of Need, to relieve and &s;uccour them, to protect and &s;ave them in all Times of their Trouble, and Danger; on their <HI>humbly looking to and tru&s;ting in him for the &s;ame.</HI></P>
<P><HI>What &s;hall we then &s;ay to the&s;e Things</HI>?

Sure|ly none at all! GOD is for his People, as he is in Covenant with them, &amp; &s;o engaged to them and for them, as he conde&s;cends to dwell among them, and take them under his &s;pe|cial Care, and Protection, and is ready to be&s;tow every needed Ble&s;&s;ing of Grace, and Providence on them, on their &s;eeking to, and tru&s;ting in him for the &s;ame.

&s;piritual when he &s;eems to be again&s;t them. And &s;ince it is &s;o. <HI>If God be thus for us who can be again&s;t us,</HI> &s;o as to prevail to the ruin of GOD's Church and People, be their Ene|mies never &s;o many, never &s;o &s;trong and potent, never &s;o malicious, politic, and de|&s;igning. Yet GOD is above them to con|troul all their Mea&s;ures, confound their Coun&s;els, and overthrow their evil Machi|nations again&s;t his People. What then can they do while GOD is for his People, and with them, to Protect, Defend, and Pre|&s;erve them, and Fight for them.</P>
<P>The DOCTRINE which &s;eems to offer it &s;elf to our Con&s;ideration is this, (<HI>viz.</HI>)</P>
<P>That GOD's Favour for, and Pre&s;ence with his Covenant People, is their Happine&s;s, be&s;t Security, and Safety always; e&s;pecially in Times of Trouble, and Danger.</P>
<P>Their being GOD'S Covenant People, and as &s;uch near to him, and intere&s;ted in his divine Favour, does not exempt them from Enemies, Troubles, and Dangers in this &s;inful World. No their being &s;o, often rai&s;eth them up Enemies, and exa&s;perates ungodly Men again&s;t them, and expo&s;es them to their Rage, and Per&s;ecution, who would gladly <HI>ra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e Zion</HI> even to the Foun|dations

thereof. But GOD has &s;uch a Fa|vour for them for his Covenants Sake, and for CHRIST's Sake, the Head of the Covenant; and becau&s;e there are many up|right <HI>Ones,</HI> and elect <HI>Ve&s;&s;els</HI> in the collective Body) as he has not for the re&s;t of the World. <HI>For what Nation is there &s;o great, who hath God &s;o nigh unto them as the Lord
our God is in all things that we call up<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n Him for.</HI> This is their Happine&s;s, in this is their be&s;t Security, and Safety: <HI>For if God be for us, who can be again&s;t us.</HI></P>
<P>Two Things here offer for clearing the Doctrine (<HI>viz.</HI>) To Con&s;ider,</P>
<P N="1">I. What is implied in God's being for, &amp; with his People.</P>
<P N="2">II. To &s;hew, that this is their Happine&s;s, be&s;t Security, and Safety always, &s;pecially in Times of Trouble, and Danger.</P>
<P>I am then to con&s;ider fir&s;t PROP. I.<HI>What is implied in God's being for, and with his People.</HI> For his being for them, certainty implies his Pre&s;ence with them, And here, 1. More is intended in it, than that of GOD's being <HI>Providentially</HI> for, and, <HI>E&s;&s;enti|ally with them</HI>; for &s;o GOD is for, and with
<PB N="11" REF="007617_0010_102BAA335CDE3E58">
the whole Creation: His Pre&s;ence fills Heaven, and Earth, and all Space. <HI>If I a&s;cend into Heaven, thou art there. If I make my Bed in Hell, behold thou art there.</HI><NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. 139.8. &amp; &s;eq.</NOTE> He is e&s;&s;entially pre&s;ent with all Creation, upholding all Things by his Power, and
governing univer&s;al Nature by his Provi|dence. He is not far from all, <HI>good,</HI> and <HI>bad,</HI> for in him we Live, and Move, and have our Being: And he is for all Cre|ation, as he upholds all Things in being, &amp; order by the Word of his Power: Pre|&s;erves, governs,&amp; provides for all his Crea|tures. He is providentially good, &amp; kind unto All,&amp; &s;upplies the wants of every living Thing: <HI>All Eyes wait upon God, and he
gives to every one their Meat in due &s;ea&s;on.</HI>&mdash;His tender Mercies are over all his Works. He is e&s;pecially pre&s;ent with Mankind, in|&s;pecting, and over-ruling the affairs of King|doms, States, and Governments, to over|turn, pluck down, or build up as plea&s;eth him; to deliver, and &s;ave the Oppre&s;&s;ed, and humble the proud Oppre&s;&s;or. He is pre&s;ent with all Individuals, Ob&s;erving all our Thoughts, Words, and Actions, and re|cording the &s;ame in his Book of Remem|brance, in order to bring every Work into

<P>But then,</P>
<P N="2">2 GOD is for, and with his own Church and People, in a more eminent, and peculiar Way, and Manner. He has cho&s;en them out from the re&s;t of Mankind, and taken them into Covenant, to be a peculiar People to him&s;elf, <HI>a cho&s;en Generation, a royal Prie&s;t|hood, an holy Nation, a peculiar People. He hath brought them near to him&s;elf.</HI><NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Numb 16.10</NOTE> Hence there is none like them in the account of the Ble&s;&s;ed GOD; none near to him in Favour as they be: <HI>For what one Nation in the Earth is like thy People, even like I&s;rael, whom God went to redeem for a People to Him&s;elf.</HI><NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">2 Sam. 7.23.</NOTE> Hence GOD conde&s;cends to &s;tand in a peculiar Relation unto them, as their Covenant GOD, and Friend. <HI>For thou ha&s;t confirmed to thy&s;elf, thy People I&s;rael to be a People unto thee forever; and thou Lord art become their God,</HI><NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">2 Sam 7.24.</NOTE> in a peculiar, and appropriate Sen&s;e. Hence they are Stiled his <HI>Cho&s;en,</HI> his <HI>Saints,</HI> his <HI>Portion,</HI> and the <HI>Lot</HI> of his Inheritance. <HI>For the Lord's Por|tion

<P>Hence,</P>
<P N="1">(1) It implies &s;pecial Favour, &s;uch as GOD has not for the re&s;t of Mankind. He is their Father, and they are the Sons, and Daughters of the Living GOD. <HI>For thou art an holy People unto the Lord thy God, the Lord thy God hath cho&s;en thee to be a &s;pecial People unto him&s;elf; above all People that are upon the Face of the Earth: And he hath avouched thee this Day to be his peculi|ar People.</HI><NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Deut 14.2.&amp;7.6.&amp;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">6 18</NOTE></P>

<P>And he is thus ready to help, and &s;ave them, as having a peculiar Favour for them, even when he Corrects them, and &s;eems to be again&s;t them: Hence the Prophet re|proves I&s;rael for di&s;tru&s;ting GOD's Favour for them, and Care of them, even in the very darke&s;t Times. <HI>Why &s;aye&s;t thou O Jacob, and &s;peake&s;t O I&s;rael, my Way is hid from the Lord, and my Judgment is pa&s;&s;ed over from my God</HI>?

both ready and able to Help, and Save them. <HI>He giveth power to the Faint, and to them that have no Might, be increa|&s;eth strength.</HI></P>
<P N="3">(3) Divine Guidance, and Conduct: GOD is for them; therefore will he Guide them by his prudent Coun&s;el: <HI>As he taught Ephraim to go, taking him by the Arms</HI>:<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">He&s;. 11.3.</NOTE> So he led, and conducted I&s;rael all the Days of Old. <HI>He led him about, he in&s;truct|ed him, he kept him as the Apple of his Eye.

<P>Again, He Guides his People by the in|fluences, and unerring Coun&s;els of his ble&s;&s;ed Spirit; making them to <HI>hear a Voice behind

But more e&s;pecially by the Agency, &amp; Conduct of Mo&s;es, and Aaron, whom he appointed over them in their re&s;pective Orders to lead, and guide his People, in the ways of Duty and Safety. How great a Ble&s;&s;ing this! and what &s;afety to the State! Such are good Rulers, and faithful Teachers to every State, and Church, great Ble&s;&s;ings, her Safety, Strength, and Ornament. <HI>The

How much then &s;hould we prai&s;e? and how Thankful to GOD &s;hould we be, for the Ble&s;&s;ing of good Rulers? And how ready should we be to Obey them? By whom GOD Leads, and Guide us for our Safety, and Benefit. Let us prize, and im|prove the Ble&s;&s;ing as becomes the Character of Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P N="4">(4) It implies Help in Times of Danger, and Trouble, and &s;ure Deliverance, in GOD's Time, which is the be&s;t Time. So the Prophet throws the Gauntlet, and bids Defi|ance in the Name of the Lord, to all the Enemies of his People. <HI>A&s;&s;ociate yourselves, O ye People, and ye &s;hall be broken in Pieces; and give ear, all ye of far Countries; gird your&s;elves for War; and ye &s;hall be Broken in pieces; Gird your&s;elves, and ye &s;hall be broken in Pieces: Take Coun&s;el together, and it &s;hall come to nought; &s;peak the Word, and it &s;hall not &s;tand; for God is with us,</HI><NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">I&s;a. 8.9, 10.</NOTE> to Fight for us, Save, and Deliver us.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="007617_0017_102BAA6C1E4CA720">GOD indeed may &s;eem to be again&s;t his People, &s;uffering WARS, and various Evils to break in upon them, for their Sins, A|po&s;tacies, and unworthy Carriage toward Him. But he is for them &s;till, and with them in their Troubles, and Adver&s;ities. <HI>When thou pa&s;&s;est thro' the Waters I will be with thee; and thro' the Rivers they &s;hall not overflow thee; when thou walke&s;t thro' the Fire thou &s;hall not be burnt, neither &s;hall the Flame kindle upon thee.&mdash;For I am the Lord thy God, the Holy one of I&s;rael, thy Salvation.</HI><NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">I&s;a. 43.2.</NOTE> And GOD's People at la&s;t, &s;hall &s;ee their De&s;ire upon their Enemies, and &s;hall Tri|umph over them.

<P>Moreover, in the days of the Judges, &amp; afterwards under pious Kings: How often did the Lord make an handful of his People Victorious over va&s;t Armies of their Ene|mies?

<P>This Ob&s;ervation might be brought down to latter Times, &amp; nearer to our&s;elves. Who more unlikely than King <HI>Henry</HI> VIII. to bring on that glorious Reformation, began in our Nation, in his Reign, and effected by wonderful Means!

<P>In like manner the Succe&s;s granted our &s;mall Army in the la&s;t War again&s;t that &s;trong Fortre&s;s of <HI>Cape-Breton</HI>; was cer|tainly a Salvation beyond a rational Pro|bability.

Thus does the Almighty GOD &s;ometimes bring about the Salvation of his People, and do great Things for them, in Ways, and by Means, lea&s;t likely to human Probability. Well, <HI>if God be for us, who</HI> then <HI>can be again&s;t us</HI>: Let us obey his Laws, &s;eek his Favour, and Tru&s;t in Him, then we &s;hall be &s;afe amid&s;t all the threatning Dangers that any Time &s;urround us.</P>

<P N="1">(1.) By directing them into &s;alutary, &amp; right Coun&s;els for their own Safety, and Defence. They know not (it may be) their own Danger but GOD does, and by his di|vine Wi&s;dom directs them into right Mea|&s;ures for their own Defence, and Safety. He influences, and enlarges their Minds, giving to them &s;uch a Spirit of Wi&s;dom, Coun&s;el, and Foreca&s;t, as to over-match the Coun&s;els of their Enemies; &s;upplant them
<PB N="28" REF="007617_0027_102BAA78E6F63E40">
in their evil De&s;igns, and guard them&s;elves again&s;t all their attempts upon them: They have Prudence given them <HI>to fore-&s;ee the Evil, and hide them&s;elves,</HI> they are directed from on High to proper Expedients, and wi&s;e Precautions, for their own Safety, and Defence: Even as the <HI>Briti&s;h Court</HI> in the Summer pa&s;t, were directed into a Fore&s;ight of, and into right Coun&s;els &amp; Mea&s;ures for, di&s;appointing and defeating, the &s;ecret and per&s;idious De&s;igns of the <HI>French Court</HI> on <HI>Nova Scotia,</HI> and other Engli&s;h Settlements on this Continent.</P>
<P>And as the Officers of the Army at <HI>Lake|George</HI> were directed into a right Conduct on the critical Day of Battle there; by which Means GOD &s;aved his People; the greater Part of them, from the cruel De&s;igns of that Blood-thir&s;ty <HI>Army of French,</HI> and <HI>Indians,</HI> and gave us a Signal <HI>Victory</HI> over them, on that Memorable EIGHT OF SEPTEMBER la&s;t: Very con&s;picuous were the intermedi|ate Step&s; of divine Providence, leading on, and opening the Way to that great Salvati|on:<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">I was my-&s;elf an Eye witne&s;s of this great Action, and &s;aw the Salvation of the LORD on that Day.

<P N="2">(2.) Sometimes by &s;ea&s;onable provi|dential Warnings, di&s;covering, and pointing out their Danger: Sometimes in an ordi|nary, and &s;ometimes in an extraordinary Way. So GOD warned the King of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> by his Prophet of the de&s;igned <HI>Inva&s;ion</HI> of the King of <HI>Syria</HI> upon him. By which means he was enabled to Defeat the &s;ame, and Save him&s;elf, <HI>not once, nor twice.</HI> Of the &s;ame kind wa&s; the Di&s;covery that divine Providence made of the &s;ecret, and dread|ful <HI>Gun-Powder-Plot,</HI> in our own Nation; a Mercy of Heaven never to be for|gotten. So the cruel Plots of the Churches Enemies laid again&s;t them, are di&s;appointed, and broken by a &s;ea&s;onable Di&s;covery made of them by divine Providence.</P>
<P N="3">(3.) Sometimes by providing for them an <HI>Azylum,</HI> a City of Refuge, or Place of defence, and &s;afety from impending Dan|gers, and Ruin. As GOD provided an <HI>Ark</HI> for Noah, and his Family: A <HI>Zoar</HI> for Lot and His&mdash;And the City of <HI>Pella</HI> for the fir&s;t Chri&s;tians, to which they fled, and were Saved, when Jeru&s;alem was De&s;troyed. And &s;o the Earth helped the Woman, and the Wilderne&s;s was made her &s;afe Retreat, from the Rage of the <HI>Dragon.</HI> Even as this

wilderne&s;s Land was made of GOD a &s;afe Retreat to our Fathers, when they fled from the Per&s;ecutions at Home.</P>
<P N="4">(4.) Sometimes by controuling, and overruling the Enemies Coun&s;els, for Hi&s; People's Deliverance.</P>
<P>GOD rules &s;upreme in the Courts of Princes, and over all the Children of Pride; turning their Hearts, and overruling their Coun&s;els at His Plea&s;ure. <HI>The Kings Heart is in the Hand of the LORD: As the Rivers of Water He turneth it whether&s;over He will.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prov. 21.1.</NOTE> Sometimes he leaves, or gives them up to a Spirit of Infatuation; that they are in&s;nared in their own Ways, and confounded in their own Coun&s;els; they are guided by a Spirit of Folly to their own Ruin. When a People are left to weak, and fooli&s;h, and to uncertain, and wicked Coun&s;els: Not having Wi&s;dom to project right Means; nor &s;teadine&s;s, nor courage to pur&s;ue pro|per Mea&s;ures, what then is like to follow but their own Di&s;appointment and Ruin, to the Deliverance, and Salvation of GOD'S own People? Thus was the haughty King of <HI>Syria</HI> confounded in his own Coun&s;els at the Siege of <HI>Samaria</HI>; when relying on the &s;uperior Numbers and Strength of his
<PB N="31" REF="007617_0030_102BAA48E2CB3A00">
Army, he de&s;pi&s;ed <HI>Ahab,</HI> and his handful of Men coming out to rai&s;e the Siege; and gave tho&s;e fooli&s;h, and haughty Orders, <HI>Whether they be come out for Peace take them alive, or whether they be come out for War take them alive.</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 Kings 20 18.</NOTE> On which followed his immediate Defeat, with a great &s;laughter of his Army, to the Deliverance of GOD's People. And it may teach all Generals that a de&s;pi&s;ed Enemy often proves a for|midable one; as tho&s;e two experienced Generals with their old veteran Soldiers from <HI>Europe</HI> found it to be la&s;t Summer, when they de&s;pi&s;ed the raw, and unexperi|enced Soldiery of this Country to their own Defeat and Ruin.<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">General <HI>Braddock,</HI> who unhappily fell in the Battle at <HI>Ohio,</HI> July 9th. 1755. And the French General. <HI>Baron de Dieskau,</HI> who was Beaten, dangerou&s;ly Wounded, and taken Pri&s;oner in the Battle at <HI>Lake George, Sept..</HI> 8th. 1755.</NOTE></P>
<P N="5">(5.) Sometimes by dividing their Coun&s;els &s;o that they &s;hall weaken the Hands of one another, and &s;o cannot perform their Enter|prize. Scarce any thing is more dangerous to a State, or Army, than divided Coun&s;els, or want of Unity in them: And when this is found prevailing, 'tis an Omen of the approaching Ruin of that State, or Army. And thus GOD &s;ometimes divides the Coun|&s;els
<PB N="32" REF="007617_0031_102BAA7BED9FEA98">
of His Churches Enemies, by which He defeats their malicious De&s;igns, and &s;aves His People. So that va&s;t con&s;ederate Army which came up again&s;t <HI>Jeho&s;haphat,</HI> and his Kingdom were utterly De&s;troyed by divided Coun&s;els, and Mutiny among them&s;elves. <HI>Ammon, and Moab &s;tood up again&s;t the Inhabitants of Mount Seir, utterly to &s;lay and de&s;troy them.</HI> And that being done <HI>every one helped to de&s;troy another.</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">2 Chron. 20.13.</NOTE> And thus GOD's People had Deliverance from that formidable Inva&s;ion.&mdash;How dan|gerous, and de&s;tructive a Thing is Mutiny in an Army! and how carefully &s;hould every leading &s;tep to it be avoided, and unity of Coun&s;els be maintained as they would hope to pro&s;per, and be &s;ucce&s;sful.</P>
<P>But to proceed</P>
<P N="6">(6) GOD can take off the Enemies of his People from their malicious De&s;igns again&s;t them, by cutting them out other Work to do. Thus he defeated the de&s;igns of <HI>Sennacherib</HI> when he came with a powerful Army to &s;ack, and de&s;troy <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> and delivered His People from that eminent Danger <HI>by cau&s;ing him to hear a Rumour</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Kings 19 7.</NOTE> of an Inva&s;ion coming on his own King|dom, on which he rai&s;ed the Siege, and
<PB N="33" REF="007617_0032_102BAA4AF75C3DC0">
ha&s;tened Home for the Defence of his own Territories. So GOD cau&s;eth evil Men to make Work for one another, and thus &s;ecures the Peace, and Safety of His own People. Such Work may po&s;&s;ibly be cut|ting out for the Kingdom of <HI>Spain,</HI> to employ them on this critical Day, by the Je&s;uits u&s;urped Kingdom in <HI>Paraguay,</HI> and the progre&s;s he is making down the <HI>River Plate</HI> to enlarge his new Kingdom. This may be a means of hindring the junction of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Arms with the <HI>French</HI> again&s;t us, or at lea&s;t of dividing, and weakning down their Power,&mdash;Or Again,</P>
<P N="7">(7.) When GOD's People are to all ap|pearance on the brink of Ruin He can rai&s;e them up &s;ome mighty Deliverer, and &s;o &s;ave them from all the Danger as he did for <HI>I&s;rael</HI> many a Time. A <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> a <HI>Jo&s;hua,</HI> a <HI>Samp&s;on,</HI> a <HI>Jephtha,</HI> a <HI>David.</HI> And for our own Nation a <HI>WILLIAM,</HI> when it was on the brink of Ruin.&mdash;And may I not add a <HI>GEORGE</HI> too, whence we enjoy the pre&s;ent happy E&s;tabli&s;hment? Yea GOD can make the <HI>Bea&s;t</HI> help the <HI>Woman,</HI> the Papi&s;ts, the Prote&s;tants, as he has many a Time done.&mdash;Or further,</P>
<P N="8">(8.) He can help and &s;ave his People by giving them a Superiority of Wi&s;dom, Strenght, and Courage, to overmatch their
<PB N="34" REF="007617_0033_102BAA7ED3B3D6A8">
Enemies: As he gave to the Jews in the Time of E&s;ther on the Day of their intend|ded A&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination, <HI>When no Man could with|&s;tand them but the Fear of them fell on all People</HI>:<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">E&s;ther 9.2.</NOTE> And their Enemies were &s;o in|timidated that they could not find their Hands,&mdash;Or again,</P>
<P N="9">(9.) GOD will by his own immediate Hand break the Power of the Enemy; and open the way for the Deliverance, and Sal|vation of his People. As he did for I&s;rael when he opened a Pa&s;&s;age thro' the <HI>red Sea,</HI> for their Deliverance, from the Power of the pur&s;uing Egyptians. Or as in the Days of Jo&s;hua, and Deborah, when the Stars in their Cour&s;es, Sun, and Moon, Fought a|gain&s;t the Enemies of GOD's People; and GOD Rained from Heaven, Hail-&s;tones, Fire, and Tempe&s;t, on their Heads to their utter De&s;truction, and Overthrow before his People; <HI>So let all thine Enemies Peri&s;h, O Lord.</HI>&mdash;Or,</P>
<P N="10">(10.) Finally, By removing particular Per&s;ons out of this World, in the very cri&s;is of his Churches Danger: As in the Ca&s;e of Queen <HI>Ann,</HI> &amp; <HI>Lewis</HI> XIV. So his Church had Deliverance, and Salvation. Thus in|finite Wi&s;dom is never at a lo&s;s to find out
<PB N="35" REF="007617_0034_102BAA4CF0318258">
ways, and means by which to Save his Peo|ple be their Streights, and Dangers what they will.
