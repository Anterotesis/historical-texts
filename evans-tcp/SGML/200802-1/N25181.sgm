<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I CANNOT expect to add any thing to your reputation, by dedicating to you the following pages. I mean not, by this act, to choo&s;e a patron who &s;hall veil my faults, or &s;creen me from the cen&s;ure of the public critic. The actions of men, particularly perhaps of young men, are &s;ometimes di&s;intere&s;ted. It is with plea&s;ure I declare to the public, how much I admire your exertions for the exten&s;ion of that amiable &s;cience which both of us cultivate: you with the happie&s;t &s;ucce&s;s; I with an humble ardour.</P>
<P>THE age in which we live is the age of natural &s;cience. The mind of LINNAEUS has effected more than the combined intellects of all the naturali&s;ts of any preceding century. Natural hi&s;tory, however, is &s;till an infant &s;cience. This is particularly the
<PB N="iv" REF="033377_0004_0FF6DAAA558F8FD0">
ca&s;e with re&s;pect to America. Even the <HI>nomenclature</HI> of our productions is extremely imperfect. We are &s;till le&s;s acquainted with the <HI>properties</HI> of our productions. I view this blank in the hi&s;tory of &s;ci|ence, with pain. This pain, however, is daily dimi|ni&s;hed: for &s;omething is daily added to the &s;tock of our knowledge.</P>
<P>I AM far from in&s;inuating, that what I offer you is important in its kind. I am fully &s;en&s;ible of the imperfections of this E&s;&s;ay. I could wi&s;h it were more worthy of your attention. If I &s;ucceed in convincing you, that there are &s;ome lovers and culti|vators of botany in the United-States, one of my objects in writing this dedication will be accom|pli&s;hed.</P>
<P>ACCEPT of my &s;incere wi&s;hes for your happine&s;s, and believe me to be, with great re&s;pect,</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>I HOPE the following pages will be received as an earne&s;t of my de&s;ire to extend our know|ledge of the medical properties of the indigenous vegetables of the United-States. I do not expect to acquire any reputation by the publication. Per|haps, in making this a&s;&s;ertion, I &s;hall not be doubt|ed, when I confe&s;s that in every thing which I have hitherto publi&s;hed, I have had reputation in view. If I have not acquired it, I have borne the di&s;ap|pointment with tranquil indifference.</P>
<P>THE readers of the&s;e <HI>Collections</HI> (for every thing that is written and publi&s;hed &s;olicits &s;ome readers), will form different opinions about my medical faith. Some of them will think I have too much; and others that I have not enough. I certainly do not repo&s;e implicit confidence in the half of what is &s;aid concerning the powers of medicines. Accordingly, I have not given a place in the&s;e pages to many of our vegetables which have been prai&s;ed as &s;pe|cifics for the cure of di&s;ea&s;es; in particular, as &s;pe|cifics again&s;t the bites of venomous &s;erpents. But, on the other hand, it will be a&s;ked, whether I mean
<PB REF="033377_0006_0FF6DAAF3B31EA58">
that all the different vegetables which I have men|tioned, &s;hould have a place in the materia medica of phy&s;icians? I an&s;wer, No. But how are we to know what plants are mo&s;t proper for the purpo&s;es of medicine, until we &s;hall have examined the properties of a great body of vegetables? The Digitalis is now thought one of the mo&s;t important of the diuretic me|dicines: but perhaps future inquiries will di&s;cover a diuretic which &s;hall, in a great mea&s;ure, &s;uper&s;ede the frequent u&s;e of this active plant. I wi&s;h to turn the attention of our phy&s;icians to an inve&s;tigation of the properties of their native productions. When it is con&s;idered how little has hitherto been done in this way, every attempt (mine is an humble one) &s;hould be candidly received. I do not mean that its faults &s;hould not be pointed out.</P>
<P>THE arrangement of the articles which I have mentioned is by no means faultle&s;s: on the contra|ry, it is liable to many objections. I &s;hould not have followed this arrangement had I been con&s;i|dering <HI>all</HI> the articles of the materia medica. I &s;hall give a &s;ketch of my ideas of a method of the &s;ci|ence, in my &s;trictures on the arrangement of the learned and elegant author of the <HI>Botanic Garden,</HI> a poem which unites the fire of Lucretius with the ta&s;te of Virgil, and a learning unequalled by that of Camo&euml;ns or of Milton.</P>
<P><PB N="vii" REF="033377_0007_0FF6DAB18E7D88A0">
I THINK it but candid to confe&s;s, that &s;ince read|ing this addre&s;s to the Medical Society, I have made &s;ome alterations in it. The&s;e alterations, however, are very incon&s;iderable. In general, even the very &s;tyle and faults of each phra&s;e are pre&s;erved, for I had not time to alter or correct much. I have left out the concluding part of the addre&s;s, relative to the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a medical library: not that I doubt the ability of the &s;ociety to form a library of its own. The notes contained in the appendix were not read to the &s;ociety.</P>
<P>WHATEVER may be the reception of this e&s;&s;ay by the public, whether favourable or unfavourable, I &s;hall pur&s;ue my inquiries concerning the nature and properties of the natural productions of my native country. I &s;hall pur&s;ue them, becau&s;e there is at lea&s;t a po&s;&s;ibility that they may ultimately tend to &s;omething u&s;eful: and becau&s;e I have the expe|rience of &s;everal years to teach me, that the cultiva|tion of &s;cience is the exten&s;ion of my happine&s;s.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>GENTLEMEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WE have a&s;&s;embled together to celebrate the anniver&s;ary of our foundation. It is an occa&s;ion which ought to give plea&s;ure to us all. We have met, however, for the difficult purpo&s;e of mingling &s;cience with plea&s;ure. This difficulty falls peculi|arly upon me. By your vote, I have been called upon to deliver the annual di&s;cour&s;e. I accepted of the appointment cheerfully, becau&s;e I was anxi|ous to demon&s;trate my attachment to the Society, of which I had the honor to be a member at a very early period of my life; a Society in which I fir&s;t imbibed my love of the different &s;ciences which con&s;titute the great fabric of medicine.</P>
<P>BUT if I accepted of the appointment with plea&s;ure, I do not addre&s;s you with confidence. I have found it difficult to &s;elect a &s;ubject for your
<PB N="2" REF="033377_0009_0FF6DAB6351E7708">
entertainment. I, at one time, contemplated a comparative view of the different theories which have prevailed in medicine, in the pre&s;ent century. But I &s;oon found this &s;ubject too exten&s;ive for our purpo&s;e: be&s;ides, in the inve&s;tigation of this view, I &s;hould have been obliged to &s;peak with a freedom, which might not have given plea&s;ure to every one of us. Men are often attached to theories, as pa|rents are attached to their children.</P>
<P>AFTER &s;ome difficulty, I have &s;elected a &s;ubject. It is An E&s;&s;ay towards a materia medica of the United-States; or, if you plea&s;e, An Inquiry what indigenous vegetables of our country may be u&s;ed with advantage in the treatment of di&s;ea&s;es. This, you will immediately perceive, is a ta&s;k both exten|&s;ive and difficult. But it is an important one. I &s;hall not, perhaps, perform a duty altogether un|acceptable to you, if I furni&s;h you with a few facts, not generally known to you before. This is all I aim at.</P>
<P>MINE is not the fir&s;t attempt of this kind. Be&s;ides the paper entitled <HI>Specifica Canaden&s;ium,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Amo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">nitates Academicae. Vol. iv. Di&s;&s;ertatio lxxii.</NOTE> Dr. Schoepf, of Erlangen in Germany, has favoured us with a &s;pecimen of &s;uch a work, under the title of <HI>Materia Medica Americana poti&s;&s;imum regni vege|tabilis.</HI>
<PB N="3" REF="033377_0010_0FF6DAB89BF2B578">
This work was printed in 1787. The author arranges the articles according to the &s;exual &s;y&s;tem of Linnaeus. This, though an objection, is not the greate&s;t. He has given us nothing from his own experience. He a&s;cribes active powers to plants which are nearly inert, and appears to me to be, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, governed by the old notion of Signatures: one of the tyrants of the ancient &s;chools. He di&s;covers none of that infidelity, or, if you plea&s;e, &s;ceptici&s;m, which ought ever to be attached to phy&s;icians: I mean not an infidelity relative to religion; but an unwillingne&s;s to acqui|e&s;ce, without good proofs, in the truth of every tale concerning the powers of medicines. This pliant, this credulous di&s;po&s;ition, has been one of the cau&s;es which have ob&s;tructed the regular march of medical &s;cience. But as the effort of Schoepf is the be&s;t of the kind, &s;o we ought to tread lightly on his work. He is at lea&s;t a man of learning; and learning &s;hould always claim indulgence from the lovers and cultivators of &s;cience.</P>
<P>I AM far from &s;uppo&s;ing that it is in my power, e&s;pecially on this occa&s;ion, to &s;upply all the defects of Schoepf's book. It would be ea&s;y to point out its faults. I aim at a rude &s;ketch of our materia medica. It is &s;o extremely unfini&s;hed, that I have no objection to its being called by any inferior name. I confine my&s;elf entirely to vegetables.</P>

<HEAD>MATERIA ALIMENTARIA.</HEAD>
<P>YOU are all acquainted with the great general divi&s;ion of the materia medica into two parts: that which relates to the aliments, or <HI>nutrientia,</HI> of mankind, and the medical part, more &s;trictly &s;o called. Each of the&s;e is highly important; but I mean in this addre&s;s to confine my&s;elf almo&s;t en|tirely to the latter branch. Yet the former &s;hould claim &s;ome of our attention. Much may be ex|pected from a country which has ble&s;&s;ed us with the maize, the potatoe, &amp;c. I could readily fur|ni&s;h you with a long li&s;t of the indigenous nu|trientia of this country; but &s;uch a li&s;t would be very unintere&s;ting. On this &s;ubject, however, an u&s;eful work might be written. He who &s;hall undertake to examine the &s;ubject exten&s;ively will find, that Providence has, in the gift of e&s;culent vegetables, been as liberal to the countries of the United-States, as to any other countries of the world, of equal extent.</P>
<P>UNDER this head of the nutrientia, I &s;hall con|tent my&s;elf with mentioning two native articles, which de&s;erve the attention of phy&s;icians and others. Perhaps, they may even &s;uper&s;ede, on many occa&s;ions, the u&s;e of &s;ome other articles, which are purcha&s;ed at a pretty dear rate.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="033377_0012_0FF6DABD3B1EBC30">
THERE grows upon the river Mobile a &s;pecies of palm, which is but little known to naturali&s;ts, but which promi&s;es to be an important article of food to man. It has no &s;talk or &s;tem above ground. The leaves &s;pread regularly all round, and when fully expanded are flabelliform. In the centre of the&s;e leaves is produced the receptacle of the fruit, which is of the form and &s;ize of a com|mon &s;ugar-loaf. This receptacle con&s;i&s;ts of a va&s;t number of drupes, or berries, of the &s;ize and &s;hape of common plumbs: each is covered with a fibrous, farinaceous, pulpy coating of con&s;idera|ble thickne&s;s. This &s;ub&s;tance is &s;aid to re&s;emble manna in texture, colour and ta&s;te; or, perhaps, it &s;till more re&s;embles moi&s;t brown &s;ugar, with particles of loaf &s;ugar mixt with it. It is a mo&s;t delicious and nouri&s;hing food, and is diligently &s;ought after in the places where it grows. Upon fir&s;t ta&s;ting it, it is &s;omewhat bitter and pungent.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">From the information of Mr. William Bartram. MS <HI>penes me.</HI> Vol. i</NOTE></P>
<P>THE large tuberous roots of the Smilax China afford our &s;outhern Indians a nouri&s;hing food. The fre&s;h roots are well macerated in wooden mor|tars. The ma&s;s is then put into ve&s;&s;els nearly filled with clear water, where it is well mixed with pad|dles. It is decanted off into other ve&s;&s;els, where it is left to &s;ettle, and after the &s;ub&s;idence is com|pleted,
<PB N="6" REF="033377_0013_0FF6DABF9BE3D4E0">
the water is ca&s;t off, leaving the farinace|ous &s;ub&s;tance at the bottom. When this is taken out and dried, it is an impalpable powder of a red|i&s;h colour. Mixed with boiling water, it becomes a beautiful jelly, which, when &s;weetened with honey or &s;ugar, affords a mo&s;t nouri&s;hing and plea&s;ant food for children or aged people. The Indians &s;ome|times u&s;e it mixed with fine corn-flour, and fryed in fre&s;h bears' oil.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">From the information of Mr. William Bartram. MS <HI>penes me.</HI> Vol. i.</NOTE></P>
<P>THE chemical hi&s;tory of the maize, or Indian corn, the ble&s;&s;ing of our country, de&s;erves to be farther inve&s;tigated. Its importance as an article of diet is &s;ufficiently e&s;tabli&s;hed by the experience of whole nations.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>MATERIA MEDICA.</HEAD>
<P>I AM not very anxious, on this occa&s;ion, about my divi&s;ion of the materia medica. I have attempted, in my lectures, to make &s;ome improvements upon the arrangement of Dr. Cullen; and, if I live, I hope to publi&s;h, in a few months, my &s;trictures on the late arrangement of the ingenious Dr. Darwin. At pre&s;ent, in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of only a &s;mall collection of original facts immediately relative to the materia
<PB N="7" REF="033377_0014_0FF6DAC21F7E4D38">
medica of the United-States, I &s;hall content my|&s;elf with di&s;po&s;ing of the&s;e facts under the nine fol|lowing heads, viz. 1. ASTRINGENTS; 2. TONICS; 3. STIMULANTS; 4. ERRHINES; 5. SIALAGOGA, or SALIVATING MEDICINES; 6. EMETICS; 7. CA|THARTICS; 8. DIURETICS; 9. ANTHELMINTICS.</P>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. I. ASTRINGENTS.</HEAD>
<P>I THINK it proper, in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of our knowledge of medicines, to give place to a cla&s;s of ASTRINGENTS. There is the more propriety for the adoption of &s;uch a cla&s;s, becau&s;e we &s;ee more readily, than with re&s;pect to many other medicines, their direct mode of operation. Our vegetable a&s;tringents, I mean the purer and more unmixed a&s;tringents, are numerous. The barks of all our oaks are of this kind. But I may here particularly mention three or four native a&s;tringents, which &s;eem to be more e&s;pecially entitled to your attention.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t is the Geranium Maculatum, or Spot|ted Geranium, which grows very plentifully about this city: it flowers in the &s;pring. The root is u&s;ed: this boiled in milk has been found an excel|lent medicine in the cholera of children. It is not nece&s;&s;ary to be very nice about the do&s;e. I imagine it would al&s;o prove u&s;eful in old diarrheas, where
<PB N="8" REF="033377_0015_0FF6DAC473029030">
the kino, and other a&s;tringents are exhibited. If nephritis, of certain kinds, be relieved by a&s;tringents, this geranium would &s;eem entitled to attention, not merely becau&s;e it is a powerful a&s;tringent, but be|cau&s;e a &s;pecies of the &s;ame genus, the Geranium ro|bertianum, or Herb-Robert, has been employed with advantage in this di&s;tre&s;&s;ing complaint.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I am not certain that the Geranium robertianum is a native of any part of America.</NOTE></P>
<P>THE Heuchera Americana is the next a&s;tringent. This is &s;ometimes called American Sanicle. It is more commonly called Alum-Root. The root is a very inten&s;e a&s;tringent. It is the ba&s;is of a pow|der which has lately acquired &s;ome reputation in the cure of cancer. I &s;uppo&s;e all its virtue, in this ca&s;e, depends upon its a&s;tringency. I may here ob&s;erve, that the di&s;ea&s;e of cancer is not confined to civilized nations. It is known among our Indians. I am in|formed that the Cheerake cure it with a plant which is thought to be the Hydra&s;tis Canaden&s;is, one of our fine native dies. I do not believe that the Heuchera has cured genuine cancer: but it &s;eems certain that it has proved very beneficial in &s;ome ob&s;tinate ul|cers, which have been mi&s;taken for cancer. In &s;uch ca&s;es, the a&s;tringent medicines are too much neglected.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="033377_0016_0FF6DAC6CD846748">
THE Actaea racemo&s;a, or Black Snake-root, is al&s;o a valuable medicine. It is &s;ometimes called Squaw-root, I &s;uppo&s;e from its having been u&s;ed as a medicine by our Indians. The root of this plant is con&s;iderably a&s;tringent. In a putrid &s;ore throat which prevailed in Jer&s;ey, many years ago, a &s;trong decoction of the roots was u&s;ed, with great benefit, as a gargle. Our Indians &s;et an high value on it. A decoction of it cures the itch. In North-Caro|lina, it has been found u&s;eful, as a drench, in the di&s;ea&s;e of cattle called the murrain.</P>
<P>THE Uva Ur&s;i<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Arbutus Uva ur&s;i of Linnaeus.</NOTE> is con&s;iderably a&s;tringent. Yet I &s;u&s;pect that it does not operate entirely by virtue of its a&s;tringent quality. This plant, from my own experience, I can recommend to you as a mo&s;t va|luable medicine. It &s;hould be in the hands of every phy&s;ician. I have u&s;ed it with advantage in old gonorrhea. But its great virtue is that of a medi|cine in nephritis. I am inclined to think that it is peculiarly adapted to ca&s;es of what I call nephritis podagrica, or nephritis depending upon gout. This is one of the plants which is common to the old and to the new-world. It grows plentifully in Canada, New-York, New-Jer&s;ey, &amp;c. Schoepf &s;ays, the Indians mix the leaves with tobacco.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Page 68.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="033377_0017_0FF6DAC917178F60">
THE Liquidambar a&s;plenifolium<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Comptonia a&s;plenifolia of Aiton.</NOTE> of Linnaeus is well known by the name of Sweet-Fern. It has of|ten been found u&s;eful in diarrhea. Other virtues have been a&s;cribed to it.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Sec Schoepf, p. 142.</NOTE></P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="2" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECT. II. TONICS.</HEAD>
<P>I BELIEVE all the a&s;tringent medicines are more or le&s;s TONIC. But there are a good many tonics which are not a&s;tringent. There is, certainly, &s;ome propriety in con&s;idering the a&s;tringents and tonics under two di&s;tinct heads, as Dr. Cullen has done. But, perhaps, the tonics &s;hould only form one &s;ec|tion of the great cla&s;s of &s;timulants. Certain it is, that many of the tonic medicines are con&s;iderably &s;timulant.</P>
<P>THE cla&s;s of tonics is extremely intere&s;ting to phy&s;icians. It embraces &s;ome of the mo&s;t valuable medicines with which we are acquainted, &s;uch as the Peruvian bark, the exten&s;ive tribe of bitter medicines, as the gentians, &amp;c. The natural in|firmities of mankind, and perhaps e&s;pecially the vices to which civilized nations are &s;o propen&s;e, will always render the tonics mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary implements in the hands of phy&s;icians.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="033377_0018_0FF6DACB6B7CACD8">
OUR woods po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;everal medicines which I am inclined to think might to be u&s;ed, with advantage, as &s;ub&s;titutes for the Peruvian bark. Perhaps, mo&s;t of our Oaks, which are in general different from the oaks of the old-world, are of this kind. Sufficient trials have not been made with them; at lea&s;t <HI>internally</HI> u&s;ed. <HI>Externally</HI> &s;ome of them have been employed with advantage. I have u&s;ed the bark of the Spani&s;h oak<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Quercus rubra montana of Mar&s;hall.</NOTE> in gangrene, and I had every rea&s;on to think it was, in this ca&s;e, equal in power to the be&s;t Peruvian bark. The bark of the Prunus Virginiana, or Wild-Cherry-tree, has been u&s;ed in intermittent fevers, and found u&s;eful. This is a very common tree. Its leaves are poi&s;on|ous to certain animals, as calves. Even the ber|ries intoxicate different kinds of birds. The barks of the Common Sa&s;&s;afras (Laurus Sa&s;&s;afras) and Per|&s;immon (Dio&s;pyros Virginiana) have likewi&s;e been found u&s;eful in intermittents.

The Dogwood is a genus which &s;eems well worthy of attention. Of this, the Cornus of the botani&s;ts, there are &s;everal &s;pecies in North-America. The mo&s;t common is the Cornus Florida, or Common Dogwood. I find this in every part of the United-States. It is one of our mo&s;t beautiful &s;hrubs. It flowers early in the &s;pring, and with &s;o much regu|larity, that &s;ome of our &s;outhern tribes were accu&s;|tomed to name the &s;pring &s;ea&s;on from its flowering. The bark is con&s;iderably a&s;tringent. It has long been employed in intermittent fevers. A decoction of it has al&s;o been employed, and found very u&s;eful, in a malignant fever, called the yellow water, Ca|nada di&s;temper, &amp;c. which, within the la&s;t eight years, has carried off great numbers of the hor&s;es in the United-States. The ripe fruit, or berries, infu&s;ed in &s;pirit or brandy, make an agreeable bit|ter. Our Indians employ an infu&s;ion of the flow|ers in intermittents. The &s;ame infu&s;ion has been much recommended by &s;ome in flatulent cholic. I have u&s;ed it as a tea.</P>
<P>THE Cornus &s;ericea, another &s;pecies, is called Red-Willow and Ro&s;e-Willow; which are very improper names. The bark of this is often mixed with tobacco and &s;moken by the &s;avages. It has
<PB N="13" REF="033377_0020_0FF6DACDB29E2528">
been found but little inferior to the common pale Peruvian bark, in intermittent fevers. This &s;pecies grows in wet places, on the &s;ides of rivers, creeks, &amp;c. and flowers in Augu&s;t and September. I know nothing of the medical properties of the other na|tive &s;pecies of this genus; viz. Cornus Canaden&s;is, Cornus Cincinata, &amp;c.</P>
<P>MANY years ago, Zannichelli, and of late, Cu&s;|&s;on and other writers, recommended the bark of the AE&s;culus Hippoca&s;tanum, or Common Hor&s;e-Che&s;nut, as a &s;ub&s;titute for the Peruvian bark. This AE&s;culus is not a native of America, though it thrives very well in the open ground of Penn&s;yl|vania, &amp;c. But we have at lea&s;t two native &s;pecies of the &s;ame genus within the limits of the United-States.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">AE&s;culus Pavia of Linnaeus, and AE&s;culus <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">lava of Aiton.</NOTE> Whether the bark of the&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;s the pro|perties which have been a&s;cribed to the Hippoca&s;ta|num, I do not know.

<P>I MUST not omit to mention, under this head, the Magnolias. Of this fine genus, we have at lea&s;t &s;ix &s;pecies, viz. the Magnolia glauca, the acuminata, the tripetala, the grandiflora, the auriculata, and the Fra&s;eri. I believe they all po&s;&s;e&s;s nearly one general a&s;&s;emblage of properties; but of this I am
<PB N="14" REF="033377_0021_0FF6DAD004C275C8">
not quite certain. The &s;pecies that is be&s;t known to me is the glauca, commonly called Magnolia, Beaver-tree, and Swamp-Sa&s;&s;afras. The bark of this is an agreeable aromatic, tonic, bitter medicine. It has been u&s;ed in intermittent fevers. The flow|ers have a powerful and to mo&s;t per&s;ons an agreea|ble &s;mell. It is an emanation which mu&s;t be con&s;i|dered as a potent &s;timulant, or incitant. I am well acquainted with a phy&s;ician in whom the newly-expanded flower evidently increa&s;ed the paroxy&s;m of a fever which came on every afternoon; and al&s;o increa&s;ed the pain of inflammatory gout. This is an intere&s;ting fact. In Virginia, a &s;pirituous tinc|ture of the cones, or &s;eed-ve&s;&s;els, of the Magnolia acuminata, which is commonly called Cucumber-Tree, has been u&s;ed, and we are told very advan|tageou&s;ly, in rheumatic complaints.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Dr. Duncan's Medical Commentaries, for the year 1793. Vol. xviii. p. 445.</NOTE> The bark of the root of the Magnolia grandiflora, &s;ometimes called Tulip-tree, is u&s;ed in Florida, in combination with the Snake-root, as a &s;ub&s;titute to the Peruvian bark, in the treatment of intermittent fevers. The flowers of the Magnolia tripetala, or Umbrella-tree, have a very powerful &s;mell. They often induce nau&s;ea and head-ache.</P>
<P>I AM inclined to think that the Cortex Angu&s;|turae, which has lately been introduced into medical
<PB N="15" REF="033377_0022_0FF6DAD258CA92A8">
practice, and is &s;o greatly celebrated as a tonic, by the practitioners of Britain, is the bark of &s;ome &s;pecies of Magnolia.</P>
<P>THE Liriodendron Tulipi&s;era, well known in the United-States, by the names of Tulip-Tree, Pop|lar, White-Wood, &amp;c. is very clo&s;ely allied, by its botanical character, to the Magnolias. They both belong to the &s;ame cla&s;s of the &s;exual &s;y&s;tem, and both, I believe, po&s;&s;e&s;s nearly the &s;ame properties. The bark of the Liriodendron is &s;ometimes u&s;ed in intermittents. Many per&s;ons are of opinion, that in this ca&s;e, it is but little inferior to the Peruvian bark. I have never employed it.</P>
<P>THE bark of the Populus tremula? or A&s;pin? has likewi&s;e been u&s;ed in ca&s;es of intermittent fe|vers. This is a powerful tonic, and de&s;erves the attention of the American phy&s;ician. It has been found very u&s;eful, as a &s;tomachic, in the di&s;ea&s;es of our hor&s;es.</P>
<P>THE Snake-root, the Ari&s;tolochia Serpentaria, is one of the more &s;timulating tonic bitters. It is certainly a valuable medicine, in the &s;econd &s;tage of certain fevers, after the inflammatory diathe&s;is has been removed. It was u&s;ed with great benefit, in a mo&s;t malignant fever, attended with carbuncles,
<PB N="16" REF="033377_0023_0FF6DAD4D93BDAA8">
which prevailed at Bri&s;tol, on the Delaware, in this &s;tate, in the years 1749 and 1753. Another &s;pecies of this genus, the Ari&s;tolochia &s;ipho of L'Heritier, grows in the neighbourhood of Pitts|burg, and in other parts of the United-States. This is a large, climbing plant. The root has a pungent, aromatic ta&s;te, and for certain purpo&s;es is perhaps preferable to the common Snake-root.</P>
<P>I SHALL conclude this &s;ubject of tonics by ob&s;erv|ing, that we po&s;&s;e&s;s a good many of the bitter plants of Europe, which have long claimed the attention of phy&s;icians. Our Gentians have not been care|fully examined. We have one &s;pecies which appears to be equal to any of the officinal kinds yet known.</P>

<P>I THINK that many of our different bal&s;amic pro|ducts may, with propriety, be con&s;idered under the head of GENERAL STIMULANTS, though they are certainly not the mo&s;t diffu&s;ible articles of this cla&s;s. Such is the re&s;in of the Populus bal&s;amifera, called Bal&s;am, or Tacamahaca-Tree. This is a native of North-America and of Siberia. The re&s;in is pro|cured from the leaf-buds. This bal&s;am is &s;o very penetrating, that it communicates its peculiar &s;mell and ta&s;te to the fle&s;h of certain birds which feed up|on the buds. It was formerly &s;uppo&s;ed, that the Tacamahaca of the &s;hops was the produce of this tree. But it &s;eems more probable that it is the pro|duce of the Fagara octandra.</P>
<P>THE gum-re&s;in which exudes from the Sweet|gum, or Maple-leaved Liquidambar-Tree, the Li|quidambar Styraci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">lua of Linnaeus, de&s;erves to be mentioned.

in diarrheas. Some of our &s;outhern Indians mix the dried leaves with tobacco, for &s;moking.</P>
<P>To the head of &s;timulants I have no he&s;itation in referring a number of poi&s;onous vegetables, with the properties of which we are not &s;o well acquainted as we ought to be. Such are the Datu|ra Stramonium, or James-town-weed, the Cicuta maculata, &amp;c.</P>
<P>THE Datura is one of our mo&s;t common plants. It is certainly a medicine po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of u&s;eful powers. The properties of this vegetable have lately been more &s;atisfactorily inve&s;tigated by one of our mem|bers, Dr. Samuel Cooper.</P>
<P>WE have &s;everal native plants of the natural order umbelliferae. That de&s;cribed by the late Dr. James Greenway, under the name of Cicuta vene|no&s;a, &s;hould be carefully inve&s;tigated. This, from his account, mu&s;t either be a direct &s;edative, or a &s;timulant, who&s;e fir&s;t operation is very &s;oon accom|pli&s;hed. It kills without inducing pain or convul|&s;ions. Perhaps the plant with which &s;ome of our Indians, when weary of life, de&s;troy them&s;elves, is the &s;ame. It grows in meadows, and has a root like a par&s;nip.</P>
<P>BEFORE I take leave of the&s;e poi&s;onous plants, I may mention &s;ome others who&s;e properties are but
<PB N="19" REF="033377_0026_0FF6DADBE9696CD8">
little known. The fir&s;t is the Rhododendron max|imum, or Penn&s;ylvania Mountain-Laurel. This is certainly a poi&s;on. It is a &s;pecies of the &s;ame genus as the Rhododendron Cry&s;anthmum, which has lately acquired much reputation in the cure of chronic rheumati&s;m.</P>
<P>NEARLY allied to the Rhododendron is the genus Kalmia. Of this we have &s;everal &s;pecies, and all of them are poi&s;ons. The Kalmia latifolia, or Broad-leaved Laurel, is be&s;t known to us. It kills &s;heep and other animals. Our Indians &s;ometimes u&s;e a decoction of it to de&s;troy them&s;elves. In the county of Lanca&s;ter, an empiric has u&s;ed the pow|dered leaves with &s;ucce&s;s in certain &s;tages of fevers, and in tinea capitis. A decoction of the plant ex|ternally applied has often cured the itch; but it mu&s;t be u&s;ed with great care, for thus applied it has been known to occa&s;ion di&s;agreeable &s;ub&s;ultus, or &s;tartings, and convul&s;ions. I have given the pow|der of this plant internally in a ca&s;e of fever, and have thus, at lea&s;t, a&s;certained that it may be u&s;ed with &s;afety.</P>
<P>THE medical properties of our different &s;pecies of Andromeda and Azalea, which in botanical character are very nearly akin to the Rhododendron and Kalmia, are but little known to me. I have long &s;u&s;pected that they are poi&s;ons. A decoction of
<PB N="20" REF="033377_0027_0FF6DADE4914F768">
the Andromeda Mariana has been found u&s;eful as a wa&s;h in a di&s;agreeable ulceration of the feet, which is not uncommon among the &s;laves, &amp;c. in the &s;outhern &s;tates.</P>
<P>THE Gaultheria procumbens, which we call Mountain-Tea, is &s;pread very exten&s;ively over the more barren, mountainous parts of the United-States. It belongs to the &s;ame cla&s;s as the plants ju&s;t menti|oned. I have made u&s;e of a &s;trong infu&s;ion of this plant, which is evidently po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a &s;timulant and anodyne quality. I am told it has been found an u&s;eful medicine in ca&s;es of a&s;thma. But I have not learned to what particular forms of this di&s;ea&s;e it is be&s;t adapted, nor in what manner it operates.</P>
<P>OUR native &s;pecies of Laurus de&s;erve to be in|ve&s;tigated. The Camphor and the Cinnamon be|long to this genus: but hitherto, they have not been di&s;covered within the limits of the United-States. The properties of the Common Sa&s;&s;afras, which is a &s;pecies of Laurus, have not been &s;uffici|ently examined. It is the Laurus Sa&s;&s;afras of the botani&s;ts.

<P>THE celebrated Gyn&s;eng, or Panax quinquefoli|um, may, with propriety, be thrown into the cla&s;s of &s;timulants. I find it difficult to &s;peak of this plant with any degree of certainty.

<P>AMONG the more acrid &s;timulants of our coun|try, I may mention the Arum Virginicum, or In|dian-Turnip, as it is mo&s;t commonly called. I could wi&s;h that the properties of this plant were examined with attention. The leaves of a plant a good deal allied to this, I mean the Dracontium pertu&s;um of the botani&s;ts, are employed, by the Indians of De|merara, in a very &s;ingular manner, in the treat|ment of general drop&s;y. The whole body of the patient is covered with the leaves. An univer&s;al &s;weat, or rather ve&s;cication, is induced, and the patient often recovers. Perhaps, it would be worth trying this practice in ca&s;es of ana&s;arca, which have re&s;i&s;ted the u&s;ual modes of treatment.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This fact was communicated to me by my friend the late Mr. Julius Von Rohr, a gentleman who&s;e death is a real lo&s;s to natural &s;cience, and perhaps an irreparable lo&s;s to the intere&s;ts of an injured and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed part of mankind; I mean the blacks.</NOTE></P>

<P>THE fir&s;t of the&s;e, the Euphorbia Ipecacuanha, like all the &s;pecies of the genus, is an extremely active plant. It is employed as an emetic by &s;ome of the country-people.

<P>I CAN &s;peak with more confidence of the Spiraea trifoliata. This is a &s;hrub, which grows very plen|tifully in various parts of the United-States.

The root, which is the part made u&s;e of, like that of the officinal ipecacuanha, con&s;i&s;ts of a cortex or bark, and a ligneous or woody part. The active power of the root &s;eems to re&s;ide exclu&s;ively in the bark. It is a &s;afe and efficacious emetic, in do&s;es of about thirty grains. Along with its emetic, it &s;eems to po&s;&s;e&s;s a tonic power.

<P>A DECOCTION of the Eupatorium perfoliatum, or Thorough-wort, is al&s;o emetic. I might have ob|&s;erved, that this plant is u&s;ed by our Indians as a medicine in intermittent fevers.</P>
<P>THE root of the Sanguinaria Canaden&s;is<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Called, in the United-States, Indian-Paint, Puccoon, Turmeric, &amp;c</NOTE> has been mentioned to me as an emetic. I know no|thing particular of this property of the plant. I &s;hould have ob&s;erved, under the head of General Stimulants, that the &s;eeds appear to po&s;&s;e&s;s nearly the &s;ame quality as the &s;eeds of the Datura Stra|monium.</P>

<P>I SHALL conclude this &s;ubject of emetics by recommending to your attention an examination of the properties of &s;ome of our native &s;pecies of Viola, or Violet. I &s;u&s;pect it will be found, that the roots of &s;ome of the&s;e are endued with an u&s;eful emetic quality.</P>

<HEAD>SECT. VII. CATHARTICS.</HEAD>
<P>WE have many indigenous CATHARTICS. Some of them are well worthy of your attention. The&s;e may be divided into two kinds, the milder, and the more dra&s;tic.</P>
<P>AMONG the more mild, I may mention the Tri|o&s;teum per&s;oliatum, &s;ometimes called Ba&s;tard-Ipecacuanha. This, when given in very large do&s;es, &s;ometimes proves emetic; hence the vulgar name. But I find it a good cathartic. The cortex, or bark, of the root is employed. I give it in do&s;es of twenty and thirty grains. On &s;ome occa&s;ions, it has &s;eemed to operate as a diuretic. But this may have been only an accidental circum&s;tance. Rhubarb &s;ometimes produces the &s;ame effect, as has been ob|&s;erved by C. Pi&s;o.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="033377_0037_0FF6DAF58AE1E768">
NEARLY allied to the Trio&s;teum, I mean in its properties, is the A&s;clepias decumbens. This is one of our mo&s;t beautiful and common plants. It has received many vulgar names, &s;uch as Pleuri&s;y-root, Flux-root, Butterfly-weed, &amp;c. It has been much celebrated in Virginia, as a remedy in dy&s;entery. I have u&s;ed it, and I think with advantage. I believe it does good principally by its purgative quality. The do&s;e is from twenty to thirty grains of the root in powder. A great deal has been &s;aid about the virtue of this vegetable in pleuri&s;y.</P>
<P>THE powder of this A&s;clepias is e&s;carotic, and has been found u&s;eful in re&s;training fungous fle&s;h in ul|cers. I believe this, and not the Poke, as has been &s;uppo&s;ed, is the plant which is employed by our &s;outhern Indians in ca&s;es of venereal chancre.</P>
<P>THE dried fruit of our Papaw, or Cu&s;tard-apple, the Annona triloba of Linnaeus, is likewi&s;e pur|gative. I can &s;ay nothing of it from my own ex|perience.</P>
<P>I KNOW nothing, from experience, of the <HI>Mecha|meck,</HI> or Wild-Rhubarb, of &s;ome of our Indians. It is, certainly, a &s;pecies of Convolvulus, or Bind-weed, and I believe the Convolvulus panduratus, which in Virginia is called "wild potatoe." Its name Wild-Rhubarb, implies that it is a purgative. An ex|tract

Vol. i. p. 35.</NOTE></P>
<P>MORE active than any of the native purgatives which I have mentioned is the Podophyllum pel|tatum of Linnaeus. This is a very common plant through the whole of the United-States, and in other parts of North-America. It is known by a variety of names, &s;uch as May-apple, Mandrake, Ipecacuanha, Wild-lemons, &amp;c. The fruit is e&s;|culent, and by many per&s;ons is thought delicious. The leaves are poi&s;onous.&mdash;It is the root which is u&s;ed in practice. In do&s;es of twenty grains, it is an excellent cathartic. It has &s;ome advantages over the rhubarb and jallap. It is mo&s;t advanta|geou&s;ly u&s;ed in combination with calomel, or the cry&s;tals of tartar. I have heard much of the vir|tues of an extract prepared of this root; but have never u&s;ed it.</P>
<P>THERE is a plant which was thought by Linnaeus to be a &s;pecies of the &s;ame genus. He called it Podophyllum diphyllum. I have &s;hown, that it is
<PB N="32" REF="033377_0039_0FF6DAFA51B251B8">
a new genus.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Tran&s;actions of the American Philo&s;ophical Society. Vol. III.

<P>THE Ca&s;&s;ia Marilandica, one of our fine&s;t plants, belongs to the &s;ame genus as the &s;enna of the &s;hops. The American &s;pecies po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es nearly the &s;ame vir|tues as the ea&s;tern &s;pecies. It is u&s;ed as a purgative in different parts of the United-States.</P>
<P>AN extract prepared from the inner bark of the Juglans cinerea, or Butternut-Walnut, has long been u&s;ed as a purgative in the United-States. It is a valuable medicine. As it is often, however, very carele&s;sly prepared by the country-people, it has gone into &s;ome kind of neglect. It ought to be prepared by the better informed apothecaries, and have a place in the Pharmacopoeia of this country, WHEN SUCH A DESIDERATUM SHALL BE SUP|PLIED. The do&s;e of this extract is from ten to thirty grains. I have thought it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es &s;ome|thing of an anodyne property.</P>
<P>I HAVE been told, that &s;ome of our Indians u&s;e as a cathartic a decoction of the bark of the root of

the Dirca palu&s;tris, or Leather-wood, already mentioned to you. Of this property of the Dirca I know nothing farther.</P>
<P>THE decoction or powder of the root of the Poly|gala Senega, or Seneca Snake-root, is al&s;o a pur|gative. Dr. Cullen, indeed, thinks its purgative is its mo&s;t &s;triking property, and therefore he ar|ranges it under his head of cathartics.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"I have put it into the catalogue of purgatives, as this is the only operation of it that is con&s;tantly very evident; and perhaps all its other virtues depend upon this."

<P>SOME of our native &s;pecies of Iris, or Flag, are powerful cathartics. Such are the Iris ver&s;icolor and the Iris verna.

<P>A SPECIES of Croton, or perhaps of Stillingia, is u&s;ed in the &s;outhern &s;tates, as a cathartic. It enters into the compo&s;ition of a medicine which has ac|quired much celebrity in the cure of that hideous di&s;ea&s;e the Frambae&s;ia, or Yaws. This plant grows

<HEAD>SECT. VIII. DIURETICS.</HEAD>
<P>DIURETICS have &s;o long been employed with be|nefit, in the treatment of drop&s;ies, that it becomes a matter of con&s;equence to increa&s;e the number of the medicines of this cla&s;s, and to learn how to exhibit, with more advantage, tho&s;e which are already known. I do not mean by this ob&s;ervation to a&s;&s;ert, that drop&s;ies cannot be cured without the u&s;e of di|uretic medicines. On the contrary, I am per&s;uaded that they can, and often are, e&s;pecially when the drop&s;y depends upon fever, or is connected with it.

<P>THE fir&s;t of the&s;e, the Polygala Senega of the botani&s;ts, along with its diuretic, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es an emetic, cathartic, expectorant, &s;alivating, and diaphoretic power. I have already hinted at its &s;alivating and cathartic operation. As a diuretic, it has been employed, and found u&s;eful, in drop&s;y, by Tennent, Bouvart, and other writers. I am informed that it has lately been u&s;ed, with great &s;ucce&s;s, in the treatment of the cynanche trachealis, or croup, by Dr. Archer of Maryland. He u&s;es a &s;trong de|coction of the root, which operates as an emetic, cathartic, and expectorant.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">There is a &s;pecies, or rather variety, of croup, which I have &s;ome|times called the Bronchial Hives.

This plant was purcha&s;ed from the northern Indians, by the late Sir William John&s;on, as a reme|dy in the venereal di&s;ea&s;e: hence its &s;pecific name, &s;iphilitica. I do not believe, after paying &s;ome at|tention to the &s;ubject, that this plant has cured con|firmed &s;yphilis. I know that the Indians, even tho&s;e who are be&s;t acquainted with the plant, are glad to have an opportunity of applying to the whites for relief, when they have the di&s;ea&s;e. They certainly do not tru&s;t the cure entirely to the Lobe|lia.

They u&s;e the bark of the wild cherry (Prunus Virginiana), the root of the May-apple (Podophyl|lum peltatum), and many other plants.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I do not believe that the di&s;ea&s;e of &s;yphilis was known among the North-American Indians before they became acquainted with the whites. Mr. John Heckewelder informs me, that the Indians &s;peak of it as a fo|reign di&s;ea&s;e communicated by the whites.</NOTE> I believe, however, that the Lobelia has been of &s;ervice in the di&s;ea&s;e. In gonorrhea it has certainly performed a cure; but the tendency of the con&s;titution, unaid|ed by medicines, to get rid of this complaint, is well known. I may here ob&s;erve, that gonorrhea ap|pears to be much more common among the Indians than &s;yphilis. The Lobelia &s;eems to operate chief|ly by its diuretic quality. From their ignorance of botany, many per&s;ons in the we&s;tern country have been u&s;ing a plant, which they call Lobelia, in the &s;ame complaints. I have received &s;pecimens of the plant under the name of Lobelia. It proves to be the Serratula &s;picata, or Spiked Saw-wort. There is good rea&s;on to believe, that it has been found u&s;e|ful, not only in veneral complaints, but al&s;o in ca&s;es of nephritis calculo&s;a, or gravel. Thus igno|rance &s;ometimes leads to knowledge. This &s;uppo&s;|ed Lobelia is a powerful diuretic. The Indians &s;ometimes drink the decoction of it &s;o &s;trong that it occa&s;ions gleets.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">They cure the&s;e gleets by eating turpentine, as I am informed by Colonel Winthrop Sargent. An old Indian a&s;&s;ured this gentleman, that a decoction of this Serratula, cures &s;yphilis in all its forms. Dr. Alli&s;on, one of the army-phy&s;icians, has an high opinion of the plant, in this di&s;ea&s;e. I am told Dr Bedford, of Pitt&s;burg, has found it an efficacious medicine in the gravel. It certainly ought to have a fair trial in the&s;e di&s;ea&s;es. The late Major Jonathan Hart a&s;&s;ured me, that the Indians northwe&s;t of the Ohio could not cure confirmed &s;yphilis. He &s;aid the Lobelia (I &s;uppo&s;e the Serratula &s;picata) had been of &s;ervice in &s;light ca&s;es; but he was per&s;ua|ded that the Indians would fall victims to the general complaint, if they were to tru&s;t wholly to their own remedies. A Mr. Wil&s;on, who is well acquainted with the Indians, particularly the Delawares and Shawnee&s;e, mo&s;t confidently a&s;&s;erts, that they cannot cure the venereal di&s;ea&s;e, "when it gets into the blood;" but that they can cure the gonorrhea.

<P>An infu&s;ion of another &s;pecies of Lobelia, I be|lieve the Lobelia inflata, has been found very u&s;eful in the leucorrhoea, or whites. It is a lacte&s;cent, and very active plant. I do not know that this acts as a diuretic, and it would have been more proper to have mentioned the plant under the head of &s;timu|lants.</P>
<P>The Ca&s;&s;ena is a &s;pecies of Ilex, or Holly. It is the Ilex vomitoria of Aiton, and is a native of Ca|rolina, We&s;t-Florida, &amp;c. It has been called South-Sea-tea, or Evergreen Ca&s;&s;ine. It is thought to be one of the mo&s;t powerful diuretics hitherto di&s;covered. It is held in great e&s;teem among the &s;outhern Indians.

It is a valuable medicine, as has been demon&s;trated by the phy&s;icians of Europe and of this country. It is commonly given in the form of an infu&s;ion, or tea; but I prefer the exhibition of it in powder. It has been accu&s;ed of occa&s;ioning, for a &s;hort time, a di&s;|agreeable affection of the eyes. But this effect may often be prevented by combining with the Spigelia &s;ome of the common Virginia Snake-root. The
<PB N="40" REF="033377_0047_0FF6DB0D47F110D8">
Cheerake-Indians have &s;o high an opinion of this plant, that it would &s;ometimes be dangerous for a per&s;on to be detected in digging it up, to carry it out of the country. The whites learned the anthelmin|tic powers of this vegetable from the Indians. The Spigelia is &s;aid to po&s;&s;e&s;s other valuable properties. Infu&s;ed in wine, it has been found an u&s;eful medi|cine in intermittent fevers. But I can &s;ay nothing particular concerning the preci&s;e mode of admi|ni&s;tering it in this ca&s;e.</P>
<P>THE Chenopodium anthelminticum grows plenti|fully in the United-States. It is commonly called Worm-&s;eed. The whole plant has a mo&s;t powerful &s;mell, of which it is very retentive. The ta&s;te is bitter, with a good deal of aromatic acrimony.</P>
<P>THE root of the May-apple, (Podophyllum pel|tatum), which I have mentioned to you under the head of cathartics, has often been found to operate as an anthelmintic. It is u&s;ed as &s;uch by the Chee|rake, and other &s;outhern Indians. Whether it ope|rates by its cathartic quality exclu&s;ively, or partly by &s;ome other quality, deleterious to the worms, I cannot &s;ay.

of plea&s;ures and of generation; if we could even a&s;certain who was the native of Peru, that fir&s;t experienced and revealed to his countrymen the powers of the Bark in curing intermittent fevers; would not the civilized nations of mankind, with one accord, concur in erecting durable monuments of granite and of bra&s;s to &s;uch benefactors of the &s;pecies? Would not even the &s;avage, who wants not a &s;en&s;e of benefits conferred upon him, be &s;een to form the tumulus of &s;tones, or to rai&s;e the green &s;od, the only monuments his humble condition would admit of his erecting? And may we not yet look for the di&s;covery of medicines as important to mankind as opium, the bark, and mercury?</P>
<P>For this purpo&s;e, the di&s;covery of new and valua|ble medicines, your &s;ituation, Gentlemen, (I addre&s;s my&s;elf at pre&s;ent, more e&s;pecially to the younger part of my audience); for this purpo&s;e, your &s;itua|tion is peculiarly happy. In the pur&s;uit of one of the mo&s;t dignified and mo&s;t u&s;eful of all the &s;ciences, you are placed in an exten&s;ive country, the productions of which have never been inve&s;ti|gated with accuracy, or with zeal. From this &s;chool, I will venture to call it the <HI>punctum &s;aliens</HI> of the &s;cience of our country, you are to &s;pread your&s;elves over the happie&s;t and one of the faire&s;t portions of the world. In whatever part of this va&s;t continent you may be placed, you will find an abun|dant
<PB N="45" REF="033377_0052_0FF6DB1913698F08">
field of new and intere&s;ting objects to reap in. The volume of nature lies before you: it has hard|ly yet been opened: it has never been peru&s;ed. But by your a&s;&s;i&s;tance, the knowledge of the natural productions of our country may be greatly extended, and travellers &s;hall then no longer upbraid us with an utter ignorance of the trea&s;ures which an all-bene|volent Providence has &s;o largely be&s;towed upon us. May I not flatter my&s;elf that among the number of tho&s;e whom I am now addre&s;&s;ing, there are &s;ome of you for whom medical di&s;coveries of importance are re&s;erved? di&s;coveries which would add a lu&s;tre to your names, whil&s;t they would en&s;ure to you that which is much more to be de&s;ired, in this mixed &s;cene of affairs, an happine&s;s that is imbo&s;omed in the hap|pine&s;s of one's country, and the world.</P>

<P>PAGE 14. "I am well acquainted with a phy&s;ician," &amp;c. The room in which the flowers of the Magnolia glauca produced the effects here mentioned, was not a &s;mall one, and was well aired. It was in the month of June.</P>
<P>I ought to have ob&s;erved, under the head of Tonics, that the Menyanthes trifoliata, or Mar&s;h-Trefoil and Bog-bean of the Engli&s;h, is a native of our country. It grows &s;pontaneou&s;ly in Penn&s;ylvania. This is certainly an active plant, and if we can depend upon the half of what has been &s;aid of its virtues, it de&s;erves a place in the Pharmacopoeia of every country.</P>

Page 19. Kalmia latifolia. In South-Carolina, this beau|tiful &s;hrub is called "Calico-Tree."</P>
<P>Pages 19, 20. "A decoction of the Andromeda Mari|ana has been found u&s;eful as a wa&s;h, in a di&s;agreeable ul|ceration of the feet, which is not uncommon among the &s;laves, &amp;c. in the &s;outhern &s;tates." This complaint is very common, particularly among the negroes, and the poorer &s;ort of white people, in Carolina, Georgia, &amp;c. It is called "Toe-Itch and Ground-Itch." It is a kind of ulcerous excoriation between the toes, &s;ome|times extending as high as the in&s;tep, and is attended with mo&s;t intolerable itching. It is probably, in a great mea&s;ure, the con&s;equence of inattention to cleanline&s;s. Is it occa&s;ioned by particular infects? Some per&s;ons, with whom I have conver&s;ed on the &s;ubject, are of opinion, that it is owing to the great warmth of the waters to the &s;outhward, in which the inhabitants are accu&s;tomed to wade a great deal. The di&s;ea&s;e is &s;ometimes &s;een in Penn&s;ylvania. Be&s;ides the Andromeda Mariana, or Broad-leaved Moor-wort, a decoction of the leaves of the Kalmia latifolia is u&s;ed for the cure of this complaint. The de|coction of the leaves of both the&s;e plants is u&s;ed. They are both called "Wicke" to the &s;outhward.</P>
<P>Page 21. "I knew a woman," &amp;c. She was a &s;tout, and &s;eemingly very hearty, woman. She informed me, that a lady of her acquaintance was affected in the &s;ame way by this tea. I could not learn whether the flowers of the Sa&s;&s;afras produced a &s;imilar effect.</P>
<P>Page 24. Rhus, or Sumac. "It is &s;aid that the bark of one &s;pecies (but I cannot tell you what &s;pecies) has been found u&s;eful in intermittents." Perhaps it is the
<PB N="48" REF="033377_0055_0FF6DB2020178BB0">
bark of the Rhus glabrum, or Smooth Penn&s;ylvania Su|mac. In &s;ome parts of our country, this &s;pecies is called "Indian Salt." Was it u&s;ed as a condiment to their food by the Indians? The berries of this &s;pecies are u&s;ed as a mordant, or fixer, for the red colour with which they die their porcupine quills. They u&s;e other mordants for the &s;ame purpo&s;e. The juice of the Upland-Su|mac (Rhus glabrum?) is &s;aid to be excellent for remov|ing warts, and al&s;o tetters. It is applied to the affected parts.</P>
<P>Page 27. "The expre&s;&s;ed juice of the fre&s;h leaves" of the A&s;arum Canaden&s;e, "is a powerful emetic." I &s;hould have ob&s;erved that the leaves are errhine. "A&s;ari canaden&s;is radices &s;uaveolentes in petio vino fermentanti immer&s;ae, liquorem gratiorem reddunt." Cornutus, as quoted by Schoepf, p. 73.</P>
<P>Page 30. A&s;clepias decumbens.&mdash;The A&s;clepias de|cumbens, and the A&s;clepias tubero&s;a, of Linnaeus, appear to me to be merely varieties of the &s;ame &s;pecies. Dr. Schoepf (page 160) mentions a plant which he &s;ays is called in Maryland, Butterfly-root, and Pleuri&s;y-root. He &s;ays he has not &s;een the plant; but that the name Butterfly-root &s;eems to &s;hew that it belongs to the cla&s;s of Dia|delphia. I &s;u&s;pect this plant is no other than the A&s;cle|pias decumbens. It is called Butterfly-weed, &amp;c. be|cau&s;e its flowers are often vi&s;ited by the butterflies.</P>
<P>Page 35. Polygala Senega. If this plant has been found &s;o u&s;eful in pleuri&s;y as it is &s;aid to have been, by Tennent, and other writers, I cannot &s;uppo&s;e it has been in genuine inflammatory pleuri&s;y, unle&s;s previou&s;ly to the
<PB N="49" REF="033377_0056_0FF6DB2274886128">
exhibition of the medicine, the lancet has been liberally u&s;ed. In the pleuri&s;y, as it is called, which prevails in the low and mar&s;hy countries, it is not improbable it has been of real u&s;e. This is a true intermittent or remittent, at|tended with a local pain, either in the &s;ide, or in the head. When it is in the head, the di&s;ea&s;e is called (a ridiculous name) the pleuri&s;y in the head. In either ca&s;e, it is a complaint in which cordial medicines, and &s;uch the Seneca is, have been exhibited with advantage.</P>
<P>Almo&s;t an hundred years ago, the Reverend Dr. Cot|ton Mather mentioned an American plant, called "Par|tridge-berries," as being excellent for curing drop&s;y. A decoction of the leaves is to be drank as a tea, for &s;everal days. It di&s;charges, he &s;ays, a va&s;t quantity of urine, as long as the di&s;ea&s;e la&s;ts, "after which it may be drank without provoking urine ob&s;ervably. Gouty per&s;ons drink it with benefit."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Philo&s;ophical Tran&s;actions, Abridged. Vol. V. Part ii. p. 160.</NOTE> I take the plant mentioned by Mather, to be the Mitchella repens of Linnaeus. This is a very common plant in every part of the United-States. In New-England, it is called Partridge-berry. Cate&s;by has given us a wretched figure of it. I know nothing of the powers of this plant. I could mention &s;ome of the &s;uper|&s;titious notions of our Indians concerning it.</P>
