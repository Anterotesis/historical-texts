<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear Friends,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THOUGH I know no Rea&s;on why you &s;hould be &s;ollicitous about any thing that happens to &s;uch a dead Dog as I am, yet as your Love (<HI>Oh unmerited Kindne&s;s</HI>) abounds ex|ceedingly towards me, I am po&s;itive you will give Thanks unto our good GOD for all the Mercies he has conferred upon me; therefore have &s;ent you as full and particular Account of the Remainder of my Voyage, as the little Lei&s;ure I have had from my Mini&s;terial Offices would permit me to give.</P>
<P><HI>Monday, Feb.</HI> 20. 1737. Spent the Morning on board, in writing Letters to my dear Friends in <HI>En|gland,</HI> to acquaint them of my fate Arrival. Went in the Afternoon on Shore to <HI>Gibraltar,</HI> and was un|&s;peakably delighted with the Pro&s;pect of the Place.
<PB N="4" REF="004632_0003_100DB200697966B0">
My Friend <HI>H.</HI> and I dined at an Inn, and after|wards went with Capt. <HI>W.</HI> and &s;ome other Com|pany, to view one Side of the Fort, which to us &s;eem'd impregnable; and at the Sight of it I could &s;carce avoid crying out, <HI>Who is &s;o good a GOD as our GOD?</HI></P>
<P>The &s;eeing Per&s;ons of all Nations and Languages gave me great Plea&s;ure: And the Difference of the Value of their Money and ours, gave me Occa&s;ion to reflect on the Stupidity of tho&s;e who place their Happine&s;s in that which has no intrin&s;ick Worth in it&s;elf, but only &s;o much as we arbitrarily put upon it.</P>
<P>Went into a <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> Chapel, wherein were the Reliques of a va&s;t deal of Pageantry, and &s;everal Images of the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> dre&s;&s;ed up, not like a poor <HI>Galilean,</HI> but in her Silks and Dama&s;ks. <HI>Oh</HI> (thought I) <HI>who hath bewitched this People, that they &s;hould thus depart from the Simplicity of CHRIST, and go a whoring after their own Inventions?</HI> Surely, Was great St. <HI>Paul</HI> to ri&s;e from the Dead, and come and view the <HI>Romi&s;h Church,</HI> his Spirits would be &s;tirred up within him, as it was at <HI>Athens,</HI> to &s;ee them thus <HI>wholly given to Idolatry.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Tue&s;day, Feb.</HI> 21. After having read Prayers, and wrote &s;ome more Letters to my Friends in <HI>England,</HI> went again to <HI>Gibraltar,</HI> to pay my Re&s;pects to Go|vernor <HI>S.</HI> being told by Capt. <HI>M.</HI> that he expected to &s;ee me. The worthy old Gentleman, like <HI>Sergus Paulus,</HI> received me with the utmo&s;t Candor, and
<PB N="5" REF="004632_0004_100DB23368BB9CC0">
gave me a general Invitation to come and dine with him every Day, during my Stay at <HI>Gibraltar.</HI> I thanked him for his Kindne&s;s; had about a quarter of an Hour's Conver&s;ation with him, and took my Leave for that Time.</P>
<P>At One o'Clock, I returned to dine with him, according to his Appointment; and was well plea&s;ed with the regular Behaviour of the Officers at Table. We had what an Epicurean would call <HI>Caena Dubia.</HI> At three I took my Leave, and walk'd about with Capt. <HI>W.</HI> and other Friends, to take a &s;econd View of the Fort; went on board about Five; read Prayers, and began expounding the Creed in the Cabbin; wrote &s;ome more Letters, and went to Bed, very thankful to GOD for &s;ending me abroad.</P>
<P><HI>Wedne&s;day, Feb.</HI> 22. This Day I intended to &s;tay on board, to write Letters, but GOD being plea&s;ed to &s;hew me it was not his Will, I went again on Shore, and paid both the Mini&s;ters of <HI>Gibraltar</HI> a Vi&s;it, who receiv'd me very affectionately, and of|fered me the U&s;e of the Pulpit. <HI>Oh what a ble&s;&s;ed Thing it is for the Clergy to dwell together in Unity!</HI></P>
<P>At Eleven went to publick Prayers, and was much plea&s;ed to &s;ee many Officers and Soldiers attend the General to Church. <HI>Methinks Religion looks doubly amiable in a Soldier.</HI></P>
<P>After Prayers, dined again with the General, who gave me another particular Invitation, as I went out of the Church. He treated me with uncommon Ci|vility, and de&s;ired me to preach the following <HI>Sun|day.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="004632_0005_100DB2039573F568">
Had an Opportunity of &s;ending a Packet of Let|ters with my Journal to my dear Friends in <HI>England. May the good LORD give them his Ble&s;&s;ing!</HI></P>
<P>Went in the Afternoon to vi&s;it a De&s;erter, who had &s;ent me a Letter, de&s;iring me to intercede for him with the Governor, he being apprehen&s;ive he &s;hould die for De&s;ertion; I intended to an&s;wer his Reque&s;t, but the Governor was &s;o merciful that he order'd him to be whip'd only, which I thought Puni&s;hment little enough. <HI>O Sin, what Mi&s;chief do&s;t thou make in the World!</HI></P>
<P>In the Evening return'd as u&s;ual on board, read Prayers and expounded in the great Cabbin, buried a Child, made an Exhortation to the Soldiers pro|per for the Occa&s;ion, wrote to &s;ome Friends at <HI>Deal;</HI> and went to Bed with unu&s;ual Thoughts and Con|victions that GOD would do &s;ome great Things at <HI>Gibraltar. Oh that I was a pure Ve&s;&s;el fit for my Ma&s;ter's U&s;e!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thur&s;day, Febr.</HI> 23. Continued all this Day on Board, did my u&s;ual Duty in the Ship, and put my dear Friend <HI>Br</HI>'s Sermon into the Hands of two Officers at <HI>Gibraltar,</HI> who came to dine on board with Lieutenant <HI>D.</HI> They behaved very much like Gentlemen, and &s;eem'd plea&s;ed with &s;erious Conver|&s;ation. <HI>May the GOD whom I &s;erve add the Chri|&s;tian to the Gentleman!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Friday, Feb.</HI> 24. <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed be GOD, who this Day hath &s;h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">wn me that he hath heard my Prayer, and not taken his loving Kindne&s;s from me!</HI> Long before I
<PB N="7" REF="004632_0006_100DB23594CD4D58">
reached <HI>Gibraltar,</HI> I pray'd that GOD would open an effectual Door, at the Place whither we were go|ing, and direct me where I &s;hould lodge; and lo! this Day He has an&s;wered me.&mdash;About Ten in the Morning comes Capt. <HI>M.</HI> on board, telling me that one Major <HI>S.</HI> (a Per&s;on I never &s;aw) had provided me a convenient Lodging at one Merchant <HI>B</HI>'s, and de&s;ired that I would come on Shore. I looking up|on this as a Call from Providence, received it with all Thankfulne&s;s, and went with Friend <HI>H.</HI> on Shore, but not without fir&s;t praying that GOD would direct us how to behave.</P>
<P>About the middle of the Town Major <HI>S.</HI> gave us the Meeting, conducted us to our new Lodgings (which were very commodious) and engaged us to dine with him and Captain <HI>M. When I &s;ent you without Scrip or Shoe, lacked ye any thing? and they &s;aid, Nothing, LORD!</HI></P>
<P>About Eleven was introduced by Doctor <HI>C.</HI> to General <HI>C.</HI> who was de&s;irous of &s;eeing me. He re|ceived me exceeding kindly, and after a little &s;eri|ous Conver&s;ation, we went to the Governor <HI>S</HI>'s, from thence to publick Prayers; and I was highly plea|&s;ed to &s;ee &s;o many Officers attending on the Gene|rals to Church. Doctor <HI>C.</HI> told me he had not known Governor <HI>S.</HI> ab&s;ent him&s;elf from Prayers once the&s;e &s;everal Years, except when he was hin|der'd by real Sickne&s;s. <HI>O that all others would let their Light &s;o &s;hine before Men!</HI></P>
<P>Retired in the Evening to our Lodgings, had Fa|mily
<PB N="8" REF="004632_0007_100DB205AB0B8FD0">
Prayer, wrote &s;ome few religious Letters, and &s;pent near half an Hour in &s;erious Conver&s;ation with the People of the Hou&s;e, gave Thanks for the Ble&s;|&s;ings of the Day, and was &s;oon convinced that GOD had &s;ent me that particular Lodging of a Truth. <HI>Be careful for nothing, but on every (even the minu|te&s;t) Thing, make your Wants known unto GOD. For he careth for you.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Saturday, Feb.</HI> 25. About Six this Morning went with Friend <HI>H.</HI> to the Church to pray with &s;ome devout Soldiers, who I heard u&s;ed to meet there at that Time, and with whom my Soul was knit im|mediately. <HI>For all my Delight is in the Saints that are in the Earth, and in tho&s;e that excel in Virtue.</HI></P>
<P>After we had fini&s;hed our Devotion, I made an Enquiry into their State, and found that their Socie|ty had been &s;ub&s;i&s;ting about twelve Years, and that one Serjeant <HI>B.</HI> (a devout Soldier indeed) now among&s;t them was the fir&s;t Beginner of it. At fir&s;t they told me they u&s;ed to meet in Dens and Moun|tains and Caves in the Rocks; but afterwards upon their applying for Leave to build a little Place to retire in, Doctor <HI>C.</HI> and Governor <HI>S.</HI> gave them the free U&s;e of the Church, where they con&s;tantly meet three Times in a Day, to pray, read, and &s;ing P&s;alms, and at any other Sea&s;on when they plea&s;e. They have met with Contempt, and are now in Deri&s;ion called the <HI>New Lights.</HI> A glorious Light they are indeed. For I conver&s;ed clo&s;ely with &s;e|veral of them, and they made me quite a&s;hamed of
<PB N="9" REF="004632_0008_100DB23901D1BA90">
my little Proficiency in the School of CHRIST. Many have joined with them for a Time, but a &s;ervile Fear of Man, <HI>that Bane of Chri&s;tianity,</HI> made them draw back. However, &s;ome continue &s;tedfa&s;t and immoveable, and tho' de&s;pi&s;ed by the World, are no doubt highly favoured of GOD. Governor <HI>S.</HI> countenances them much, and has &s;poke of them often to me with Re&s;pect. <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed be GOD, even the Father of our LORD JESUS CHRIST, who hath not left him&s;elf without Witne&s;s in any Place, but hath &s;ome every where, who &s;erve him and work Righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Sunday</HI> before we came hither, I was telling my Friend <HI>H.</HI> that I had rea&s;on to think, by what had happen'd to me, that GOD had &s;ome Work for me to do at <HI>Gibraltar;</HI> he an&s;wer'd that there could not much Good be expected from among Soldiers. I replied&mdash;No doubt GOD has &s;ome &s;ecret ones in all Places, who tremble at his Word. And lo he hath this Day brought me to them. <HI>By this I know thou favoure&s;t me, O LORD thou King of Saints.</HI></P>
<P>There is al&s;o another Society of the <HI>Scotch</HI> Church, who in Contempt are called <HI>Dark Lanthorns.</HI> It has &s;ub&s;i&s;ted about a Year, and is made up of many &s;erious Chri&s;tians, as I was informed. I did not think it agreeable to vi&s;it them, but I &s;ent them, as well as the other Society, &s;ome proper Books; had religious Talk with &s;everal of them, and endea|voured to unite both Societies together. <HI>Oh when will that Time come, when all Difference about Exter|nals
<PB N="10" REF="004632_0009_100DB207360C4DC0">
&s;hall be taken away, and we all with one Heart, and one Mouth glorify our LORD JESUS CHRIST!</HI></P>
<P>About Eight return'd to my Lodgings, and after having wrote &s;ome Letters, went on board the <HI>Amy</HI> to marry a Couple who &s;ent to me Ye&s;terday to come and <HI>celebrate their Nuptials.</HI> I took that Op|portunity of exhorting them all to <HI>take heed to the Things that belong to their Peace.</HI> Some, I believe, were affected, but the Generality of them behaved &s;o carele&s;s, that I could not but &s;ee a Difference be|tween tho&s;e that have a Mini&s;ter and tho&s;e that have not.</P>
<P>About Twelve went on board my own Ship, dined, did &s;ome nece&s;&s;ary Bu&s;ine&s;s, read Prayers, gave my Flock a warm Exhortation, and returned about Five on Shore, where I &s;pent near two Hours with the devout Soldiers in the Church. Many of them conver&s;ed mo&s;t &s;piritually, and &s;eem'd well acquainted with the Pangs of the New Birth. <HI>May GOD perfect the good Work begun in their Hearts! O how amiable are thy Servants, O LORD of Ho&s;ts!</HI> How would the World admire them did they &s;ee their Beauties! But Satan does now as formerly dre&s;s them in Bears Skins in order to have them baited.</P>
<P><HI>Sunday, Feb.</HI> 26. Between Five and Six in the Morning went with Mr. <HI>H.</HI> (which I did all the while I was at <HI>Gibraltar</HI>) and &s;ung P&s;alms, prayed and expounded the Le&s;&s;ons to the devout Soldiers in the Church, and was much enlarged. <HI>Thanks be given unto Thee, O LORD.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="004632_0010_100DB23A8A1B14F8">
Intended to go and preach to my People; was prevented by the Violence of the Wind; but was plea&s;ed to hear from &s;ome <HI>Gibraltar</HI> Officers, who dined that Day on board the <HI>Whitaker,</HI> that &s;ome of my Flock had the Courage to read Prayers and &s;ing P&s;alms them&s;elves, and (as I found afterwards) con|tinued &s;o to do, during my Ab&s;ence from them. <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed be GOD! I hope I &s;hall have &s;ome that dare be &s;ingularly Good, and will not be kept out by the Pre&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>Preached in the Morning at <HI>Gibraltar,</HI> before &s;uch a Congregation of Officers and Soldiers as I never before &s;aw: The Church, tho' very large, was quite thronged: And GOD was plea&s;ed to &s;hew me, that he had given extraordinary Succe&s;s to my Sermon. <HI>O how is the divine Strength magnified in my Weak|ne&s;s! O grant I may like a pure Cry&s;tal tran&s;mit all the Light thou poure&s;t upon me; and never claim as my own what is thy &s;ole Propriety!</HI></P>
<P>Dined with Friend <HI>H.</HI> at Governor <HI>S'</HI>s, who &s;ent mo&s;t kindly to invite us. The Law at his Table was the &s;ame with that of <HI>Aha&s;uerus,</HI> "No one was compelled:" And all the Officers behav'd in &s;uch a decent innocent Manner every Time I dined there, that they plea&s;ed me very much. <HI>Surely &s;ome Fear of GOD is in that Place!</HI></P>
<P>After Evening Prayers (for there is no Sermon in the Afternoon) I went and expounded, prayed and &s;ung P&s;alms with the Society, and had near thirty Hearers. <HI>May the good LORD give it his Ble&s;&s;ing.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="004632_0011_100DB20AB20BF360">
At Night had &s;ome devout Conver&s;ation with my Ho&s;t and Ho&s;te&s;s, who &s;eemed to love me as their own Soul, prayed for ab&s;ent Friends, and went to Bed a&s;hamed I had done &s;o little for GOD on a Sabbath Day. But when we cannot do as we <HI>would,</HI> we mu&s;t do as we <HI>can.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Monday, Feb.</HI> 27. Went to the Church, and did as Ye&s;terday: and was vi&s;ited afterwards by two of the Nonconforming Society, who &s;eemed to be <HI>I&s;raelites indeed:</HI> I exhorted them to Love and Unity, and not to let a little Difference about a few Externals occa&s;ion any Narrow-&s;piritedne&s;s to ari&s;e in their Hearts. I advi&s;ed them to come and hear me expound in the Church, which they did; and providentially the Le&s;&s;on was the 4th of the <HI>Ephe&s;i|ans,</HI> from whence I took Occa&s;ion to urge on them the Nece&s;&s;ity of loving one another with a Catholick di&s;intere&s;ted Love; to be of one Heart and one Mind, and to join without Re&s;pect of Per&s;ons in ha&s;tening the Kingdom of our Lord JESUS CHRIST. I hope GOD gave a Ble&s;&s;ing to what was &s;aid: For I ob&s;erved they came con&s;tantly afterwards, and was told there was a perfect Harmony between them. <HI>What infinite Mi&s;chief have needle&s;s Divi&s;ions occa|&s;ioned in the Chri&s;tian World?</HI> Divide &amp; Impera, <HI>is the Devil's Motto.</HI></P>
<P>Dined and &s;upped at General <HI>C</HI>'s with Mr. <HI>H.</HI> and was received mo&s;t courteou&s;ly: <HI>The LORD re|ward him in that Day!</HI> The Officer &s;eem'd &s;tudi|ous to oblige me, and to be &s;ollicitous for my Stay

at <HI>Gibraltar:</HI> But my Face was &s;et to go towards <HI>Georgia. The LORD direct my going in his Way.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Tue&s;day, Feb.</HI> 28. Expounded in the Church as u&s;ual; went on board, read Prayers and expounded to my own Flock; dined with Friend <HI>H.</HI> at Go|vernor <HI>S</HI>'s, who &s;ent to invite us; and expounded to a large Number of Soldiers, in the Evening at Church.</P>
<P>Was a&s;ked by Dr. <HI>C.</HI> in the Name of the Gover|nor, Colonel <HI>C.</HI> to preach every Prayer Day whil&s;t I &s;tay'd at <HI>Gibraltar,</HI> which I promi&s;ed to do, and perceived the Word of GOD to run very &s;wiftly. Many of the Inhabitants pre&s;&s;ed me to &s;tay with them, and were exceeding kind to tho&s;e who were with me, for my &s;ake. <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed be GOD, for thus giving me Favour in his People's Sight! LORD, what am I, or what is in me, that thou &s;houlde&s;t thus &s;o highly honour me? Grant, O LORD, the more thou exalte&s;t me, the more I may aba&s;e my&s;elf, and al|ways be looking to the Rock from whence I was hewn?</HI></P>
<P>Conver&s;ed with one of the devout Soldiers, who was under &s;trong &s;piritual Trials; and GOD was plea&s;ed to give him Comfort. I find it nece&s;&s;ary more and more every Day, that Mini&s;ters &s;hould be tempted in all Things like unto their Brethren, that they may be able experimentally to &s;uccour tho&s;e that are tempted.</P>
<P><HI>Wedne&s;day, March</HI> 1. Expounded in the Morning, and was highly plea&s;ed at my Entrance into the Church, to &s;ee &s;everal Soldiers kneeling in &s;everal

<P><HI>Thur&s;day, March</HI> 2. Spent Part of the Day in writing Letters. Dined and &s;up'd at Mr. <HI>A'</HI>s, chief Civil Magi&s;trate in <HI>Gibraltar,</HI> and was entertained with uncommon Love and Affection.</P>
<P>Expounded twice in the Church, as u&s;ual, and at Night had above three hundred Hearers; among&s;t whom were many Officers, Ladies, and Dr. <HI>C.</HI> the Mini&s;ter of the Church him&s;elf, who would have had me went up into the Reading D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">k, that I might have the greater Command of the People; but I declined it that Night. <HI>GOD be prai&s;ed for &s;ending me abroad, and pro&s;pering the Work of his Hands upon me.</HI></P>

<P>This Morning, be&s;ides a great Number of the Soldiers, near if not more than a Dozen of the Town's People came to Church to hear me ex|pound. Afterwards, we breakfa&s;ted with a Gentle|woman, who &s;ent by Major <HI>S.</HI> to invite us, and mo&s;t gladly received us into her Hou&s;e.

The Colonel and Governor mo&s;t readily con&s;ented; there was a mo&s;t thronged Audience, and GOD was plea&s;ed to &s;et his Seal to my Sermon: Many Officers and Soldiers wept &s;ore|ly, and a vi&s;ible Alteration was ob&s;erv'd in the Gar|ri&s;on for &s;ome Days after. <HI>O that their Convictions may end in their Conver&s;ion, and that they may bring forth the Fruits of the Spirit!</HI></P>

<P>Went in the Afternoon to the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Synagogue, and was &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee one of the Head of them come from the farthe&s;t End, and put me in one of their chiefe&s;t Seats: But afterwards he told me he had heard my Sermon Ye&s;terday again&s;t <HI>Swearing,</HI> and thanked me for it. <HI>Not unto me, not unto me, O LORD, but unto thy Name be all the Thanks and Glory!</HI> I continued with them their whole Service, and &s;pent mo&s;t of my Time there in &s;ecret Prayer to GOD, <HI>That the Veil might be taken from their Hearts, and that ble&s;&s;ed Time might come when his cho&s;en People &s;hould again be engrafted into their own Olive-Tree, and all</HI> I&s;rael <HI>be &s;aved.</HI></P>
<P>Vi&s;ited an unhappy Man in Pri&s;on, who la&s;t Night, in a drunken Fit, murdered a Fellow Sol|dier. I providentially met him ju&s;t as he was ap|prehended, and laid before him the Terrors of the LORD. At fir&s;t he &s;eemed unconcerned; but in a

&s;hort Time he was pricked to the Heart, de&s;ired me to come and &s;ee him, and to-day trembled and wept bitterly. <HI>Oh Drunkenne&s;s, what Mi&s;chief ha&s;t thou done? Thy Name is Legion; for behold a Troop of Sins come along with thee.</HI></P>
<P>In the Evening I had near, if not more, than a thou&s;and Hearers; and I took Occa&s;ion, from the poor Man's Example before mention'd, to warn the Soldiery not to be drunk with Wine, wherein is Exce&s;s; a Sin that mo&s;t ea&s;ily be&s;ets the Men of <HI>Gibraltar. May they hear and fear, and &s;in no more pre&s;umptuou&s;ly.</HI> I had a great Hoar&s;ene&s;s upon me; but notwith&s;tanding, GOD enabled me to &s;peak with Power. <HI>When we are weak, then are we &s;trong. What Mercies has GOD &s;hewn me this la&s;t Week! Oh that my Friends, when they hear of it, may prai&s;e him! for &s;urely GOD has hearkened to their Prayer.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sunday, March</HI> 5. After Morning Expo&s;ition in the Church, went and &s;aw the <HI>Roman Catholicks</HI> at their high Ma&s;s; and &s;hall only make this Re|mark: That there needs no other Argument again&s;t <HI>Popery,</HI> than to &s;ee the Pageantry, Super&s;tition, and Idolatry of their Wor&s;hip.</P>
<P>About Ten, went to the Church belonging to the Garri&s;on; preached to a mo&s;t thronged Audi|ence, and received (what my Soul longed after) the Sacrament of CHRIST's mo&s;t ble&s;&s;ed Body and Blood: Both the Generals were there, and near fifty more Communicants. The weekly Collection for the Poor was larger than ever was known:
<PB N="18" REF="004632_0017_100DB210DEAC8A00">
And ***** was &s;o affected, that he wi&s;hed him&s;elf a de&s;pi&s;ed <HI>Methodi&s;t. We are not fit for GOD to work by, 'till we are de&s;pi&s;ed by Men, that the Ex|cellency and Power of Preaching may be &s;een to be of GOD only.</HI></P>
<P>Dined at Governor <HI>S</HI>'s, and, at the Reque&s;t of the Inhabitants and Gentlemen of the Garri&s;on, preach'd in the Afternoon. Expounded in the Evening to above a thou&s;and Hearers, of all Denominations; &s;upped with General <HI>C.</HI> went home betimes, full of un&s;peakable Comfort: I am never better than when I am on the full Stretch for GOD. <HI>GOD grant I may not, like</HI> Jehu, <HI>drive furiou&s;ly at fir&s;t, and after|wards fall back; but, forgetting tho&s;e Things which are behind, may I reach out to tho&s;e Things that are before, and pre&s;s forwards towards the Mark, for the Prize of my high Calling in CHRIST JESUS!</HI> Me|thinks I hear my dear Friends &s;ay &s;ilently,<HI>Amen.

<P><HI>Monday, March</HI> 6. Had near, if not more than a hundred at Morning Expo&s;ition; and it being the la&s;t Day of my &s;ojourning at <HI>Gibraltar,</HI> many came to me weeping, telling me what GOD had done for their Souls, de&s;iring my Prayers, and promi&s;ing me theirs in Return. Others both gave and &s;ent me Tokens of their Love, as Cakes, Figs, Wine, Eggs, and other Nece&s;&s;aries for my Voyage, and &s;eemed to want Words to expre&s;s their Affection. <HI>The good LORD note their Kindne&s;&s;es in his Book, and reward them a thou&s;and &s;old!</HI></P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="004632_0018_100DB243EB38A2E0">
About Twelve, went to the Church, according to Appointment, and made a farewel Exhortation, as GOD gave me Utterance, to a great Number of weeping Soldiers, Women, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> after which we kneeled down, and having recommended each other to the Care of GOD, I left them, went and took my Leave of the two Generals; vi&s;ited the confined Pri&s;oner; dined at a Gentlewoman's Hou&s;e of the Town; left near fifty Letters to be &s;ent to <HI>England;</HI> and about Four went on board, accompanied to the Sea-&s;ide with near two hundred Soldiers, Women, Officers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> who all &s;orrowed at my Departure, and wi&s;hed me good Luck in the Name of the LORD. Surely I may now expect greater Succe&s;s abroad, having &s;uch an Addition of Interce&s;&s;ors in my Behalf. <HI>O LORD, put their Tears into thy Bot|tle, and let their Cry come unto Thee.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Samp&s;on's</HI> Riddle has been fulfilled at <HI>Gibraltar: Out of the Eater came forth Meat; out of the Strong came forth Sweetne&s;s.</HI> Who more unlikely to be wrought upon than Soldiers? And yet I have not been among&s;t any Set of People, where GOD has made his Power more to be known. Many that were quite &s;tark blind, have received their Sight; many that have fallen back, have repented, and turned unto the LORD again; many that were a&s;hamed to own CHRIST openly, have waxen bold; and many that were Saints have had their Hearts filled with Joy un&s;peakable, and full of Glory. <HI>This is the LORD's Doing, and it is marvellous in our

May they be my Joy and Crown of Rejoicing at the la&s;t Day; and may GOD's Mercies to me in every Place make me more humble, more zealous, more thankful, and more &s;teady to do or &s;uffer whatever my dear Re|deemer hath allotted for me. Into his Hands I com|mend my Spirit, as into the Hands of an all powerful Pre&s;erver.</HI></P>
<P>About Five came on board, and was gladly re|ceived by my Flock, whom I hope to love better for being a little ab&s;ent from them. Interceded and gave Thanks as u&s;ual, at Night on Deck; and was plea&s;ed that I was again retired from the World. It rained much, but that made us the more fervent. <HI>Water us, O LORD, we be&s;eech thee with the Dew of thy heavenly Benediction!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Tue&s;day, March</HI> 7. Went and conver&s;ed with, and di&s;per&s;ed &s;ome Books among&s;t the Soldiers, that we took from <HI>Gibraltar.</HI> Three of them belonged to one of the Societies, and de&s;ired with &s;ome others, to come with me in our Ship. <HI>GOD &s;anctify my Mini&s;try unto them!</HI> Mo&s;t of the re&s;t are of the <HI>Scots</HI> Church, but &s;eem very willing to conform. <HI>What a pity it is, CHRIST's &s;eamle&s;s Coat &s;hould be rent in Pieces on account of Things in them&s;elves purely indifferent!</HI></P>
<P>At Dinner we were likely to be &s;truck again&s;t by the Man of War; but GOD had Mercy on us,
<PB N="21" REF="004632_0020_100DB24607078F80">
commanded the Wind to &s;hift about, and delivered us out of &s;o great a Danger. <HI>Oh that we may &s;h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">w, forth our Thankfulne&s;s, not only with our Lips, but in our Lives!

<P>This Day we &s;et &s;ail from <HI>Gibraltar.</HI> At fir&s;t the Wind was fair, but afterwards blew contrary, which made both me and many others &s;ick. I &s;hould have wondered if GOD had not &s;ent me a Thorn in the Fle&s;h, after &s;uch abundant Succe&s;s. <HI>May I learn to &s;uffer, as well as to do, thy Will, O GOD!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Wedne&s;day, March</HI> 8. Had a u&s;eful Conference with one who was an in&s;trument under GOD, of in|troducing me at <HI>Gibraltar,</HI> and who, I tru&s;t, will make a devout Centurion. <HI>Grant this, Holy Father, for thy dear Son's &s;ake!</HI></P>
<P>Fini&s;hed my Expo&s;ition on the <HI>Creed</HI> in the great Cabbin, and did my other Duty in the Ship, as u&s;ual. The Wind blew hard, and GOD &s;ent abroad his Lightning great Part of the Day. <HI>J. D.</HI> Friend <HI>H.</HI> and my&s;elf al&s;o were &s;ick, but not &s;o as to pre|vent our Interce&s;&s;ion for ab&s;ent Friends. <HI>Whatever befals me, O GOD, may I never forget their Works and Labour of Love.</HI> As yet, ble&s;&s;ed be GOD, they are always on my Mind, and I bear them on my Heart when&s;oever I go in and out from before the LORD. And nothing does and will &s;upport me more under all Cro&s;&s;es, than the Hopes of &s;eeing

them grown in Grace when I return to <HI>England. O GOD prepare me for &s;o great a Ble&s;&s;ing!</HI></P>
<P>Gave my&s;elf, as much as my Indi&s;po&s;ition of Body would give me leave, to the Word of GOD and Prayer; and was much affected with what is &s;aid of <HI>Hezekiah,</HI> 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> xxxii. 25. that becau&s;e he ren|dered not again, was not thankful enough for the great Things GOD had done for him, he was per|mitted to fall thro' the Pride of his Heart. <HI>Alas! what Danger am I in of &s;haring the &s;ame Fate! O my Friends, cry mightily unto GOD, that no &s;uch Evil come upon me.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thur&s;day, March</HI> 9. Married a Couple on Deck. I endeavoured to give them a &s;uitable Exhortation after the Solemnity was over, and hope this Couple will call CHRIST to their Marriage. <HI>It is through a Neglect of this, that we have &s;o few happy Matches.</HI></P>
<P>The contrary Wind &s;till continuing, my Sea|&s;ickne&s;s encrea&s;ed; &s;o that I was obliged to omit reading Prayers to the Soldiers, and go to Bed &s;ooner than u&s;ual. I find this Sickne&s;s will purge my Body, and hope, through Grace, it will purify my Soul. <HI>Every Branch that beareth Fruit,</HI> &s;ays CHRIST, <HI>my Father purgeth it, that it may bring forth more Fruit. May that Scripture this Day be fulfilled in my Heart!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Friday, March</HI> 10. My bodily Indi&s;po&s;ition &s;till increa&s;ed; there was a great Storm without, but, ble&s;&s;ed be GOD, a Calm within. Sometimes indeed, my Will would inwardly rebel, which plainly &s;hew'd me what a Di&s;tance I was from GOD: But I hope,
<PB N="23" REF="004632_0022_100DB248226D56D8">
through inward and outward Sufferings, I &s;hall at length, be able to &s;ay in all Things, <HI>Father, not my Will, but thine be done.</HI></P>
<P>Did my u&s;ual Duty in the great Cabbin, and be|gan expounding the Ten Commandments; inter|ceded for Friends on Deck, and went to Bed full of a Sen&s;e of my own Unworthine&s;s. Oh that I could always &s;ee my&s;elf in my proper Colours! I believe I &s;hould have little Rea&s;on to fall down and wor&s;hip my&s;elf. <HI>GOD be merciful to me a Sinner.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Saturday, March</HI> 11. Ble&s;&s;ed be GOD, this Morn|ing the Storm began to blow over, and Light broke in upon my Soul. Was enabled to read Prayers and expound both in the Cabbin and to the Soldiers, with more Vigor than I have &s;ince we left <HI>Gibraltar.</HI> Had Rea&s;on to think my late Indi&s;po&s;ition had been &s;anctified to me. <HI>Suffering Times are a Chri&s;tian's be&s;t improving Times:</HI> For they break the Will, wean us from the Creature, prove the Heart; and by them GOD teaches his Children, as <HI>Gideon</HI> by Thorns and Briars taught the Men of <HI>Succoth.</HI></P>
<P>All the Time of my Indi&s;po&s;ition, my dear Friend <HI>H.</HI> mourned over me like a Dove. Ble&s;&s;ed be GOD, Familiarity does not breed Contempt between us, but our Love to each other increa&s;es daily. <HI>JESUS CHRIST is the only Rock whereon alone true Friend&s;hip can be built.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sunday, March</HI> 12. Expounded with more En|largement than u&s;ual, and gave my People Notice that I intended &s;peaking to them one by one, to &s;ee
<PB N="24" REF="004632_0023_100DB2174153A920">
what Account they could give of their Faith. <HI>I have not cea&s;ed warning every one of you,</HI> &s;ays the Apo&s;tle. <HI>May I follow his Steps!</HI></P>
<P>Preached the Sermon GOD enabled me to make in the Storm before we came to <HI>Gibraltar,</HI> in the great Cabbin; and GOD was plea&s;ed to &s;et his Seal to it. Had &s;ome clo&s;e Conver&s;ation with my Com|panions about their Interior; interceded for ab&s;ent Friends, and had Rea&s;on to hope my weak Efforts to promote his Glory had not been in vain in the LORD. <HI>May GOD give me a thankful Heart!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Monday, March</HI> 13. Ble&s;&s;ed be GOD! this is the mo&s;t comfortable Day I have had &s;ince I came la&s;t abroad, &s;lept better than u&s;ual; was enabled to com|po&s;e freely; [perceived my Appetite to return] was enlarged much in Interce&s;&s;ion, and found I had Rea|&s;on to give Thanks for my late Indi&s;po&s;ition. <HI>O how gently does my gracious Ma&s;ter deal with me! Though Sorrow may endure for a Night, yet Joy cometh in the Morning. LORD, grant I may &s;pend that Health thou ha&s;t now re&s;tored to me to thy Ho|nour and Service! It is good for me that I have been a little cha&s;ti&s;ed; for who knows but I might other|wi&s;e have peri&s;hed by being lifted up above mea&s;ure with my la&s;t Succe&s;s? LORD, give me Humility, tho' it be through Sufferings! So &s;hall thy Ble&s;&s;ings never prove my Ruin.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Tue&s;day, March</HI> 14. Began to put in Execution what I promi&s;ed on <HI>Sunday,</HI>&mdash;enquired into the Faith of tho&s;e committed to my Charge; and tho' all of

them were not &s;o great Proficients as I could wi&s;h, yet I find they know enough to &s;ave them, if they put what they know in practice; &s;o that they can|not charge GOD, if they mi&s;carry. <HI>Oh! that the LORD may give them his Ble&s;&s;ing!</HI></P>
<P>Had much of the Pre&s;ence of GOD with me, and felt &s;uch a fervent Love for my Chri&s;tian Friends, that I feared how I &s;hould behave, was GOD to call any of them from me. But I tru&s;t &s;ufficient for &s;uch an Hour will be the Strength thereof.</P>
<P><HI>Wedne&s;day, March</HI> 15. Was much plea&s;ed with my pre&s;ent Situation, and had Rea&s;on to ble&s;s GOD for &s;ome further vi&s;ible good Effects of my Mini|&s;try. Was highly delighted in &s;eeing Friend <HI>H.</HI> active in teaching the Lambs of my Flock: He has now gotten a regular School, and the Children began to-day to come at regular &s;et Hours: Several al&s;o of the Soldiers learn to write and read; &s;o that my Friend is like to make an u&s;eful Man. <HI>GOD make him more and more &s;o every Day!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thur&s;day, March</HI> 16. Preached this Afternoon my Sermon again&s;t Swearing, at which &s;everal of the Soldiers wept. Ble&s;&s;ed be GOD! that Sin is much abated among&s;t us; and I think a vi&s;ible Alteration may be perceived through the whole Ship. <HI>Not unto me, not unto me, O LORD, but un|to thy Name be the Glory!</HI></P>
<P>Was much &s;trengthned in my pre&s;ent Underta|king, by reading the Story of <HI>Ezra,</HI> and joined in Interce&s;&s;ion with tho&s;e who &s;et apart that Day as a

Day of Fa&s;ting and Prayer for the Sins of the Na|tion to which we belong. <HI>May they prove as effec|tual as tho&s;e which</HI> Mo&s;es <HI>put up for the Children of</HI> I&s;rael!</P>
<P>The Sick increa&s;ed to-day; vi&s;ited near a Dozen. <HI>May I by this frequent vi&s;iting &s;ick Beds, learn to improve my Time of Health: For, alas, What can be done in Time of Sickne&s;s?</HI> I find but few that are able with any tolerable Patience to &s;u&s;tain their bodily Infirmities: <HI>But to have a wounded Spirit at the &s;ame Time, Good GOD, who can bear it?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Friday, March</HI> 17. La&s;t Night GOD &s;ent us a fair Wind; and we began to &s;ail mo&s;t plea&s;antly: I was comforted on every Side, and enabled to in|terceed fervently for all Mankind. <HI>Oh that the Love of GOD and Man was &s;hed abroad in my Heart!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Saturday, March</HI> 18. The Weather being exceed|ing fair, and the Sea calm, I went with Capt. <HI>W.</HI> on board the <HI>Lightfoot,</HI> dined with the Gentlemen belonging to the Ship and Colonel <HI>C.</HI> who came on board to pay them a Vi&s;it: Married a Couple; di&s;per&s;ed <HI>Bibles, Te&s;taments, Soldiers Monitors</HI> among&s;t the Men; exchanged &s;ome Books for &s;ome Cards, which I threw over-board; preach'd a Sermon a|gain&s;t Drunkenne&s;s, which GOD enabled me to fini&s;h Ye&s;terday; and returned in the Evening, highly delighted with &s;eeing the Porpoi&s;es roll about the great Deep. <HI>O LORD, the Sea is full of thy Riches! marvellous are thy Works, and that my Soul knoweth right well. O that I may live to prai&s;e thee for them!

What Mercies have I received this Week! they are more in Number than the Hairs of my Head. Oh that my Friends would give Thanks for me!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sunday, March</HI> 19. Went with Captain <HI>W.</HI> on board the <HI>Amy;</HI> read Prayers and preach'd to above two hundred and twenty Hearers; and married a Couple, who did not behave &s;o well as I could wi&s;h: The Bridegroom laughed &s;everal Times in the mid&s;t of the Solemnity, upon which I &s;hut up my Prayer-Book: But he &s;hewing his Concern by weeping, I then proceeded, gave him and the Bride a Bible, as the be&s;t Pre&s;ent I could make them; and exhorted all to Holine&s;s of Life. <HI>GOD give them a hearing Ear, and an obedient Heart!</HI></P>
<P>Dined with Colonel <HI>C.</HI> who treated me with the utmo&s;t Civility, and took care to di&s;po&s;e or &s;ome Books I brought with me to proper Per&s;ons.</P>
<P>About Three we returned to the <HI>Whitaker,</HI> read Prayers and preached my Sermon again&s;t Drunken|ne&s;s; after which Capt. <HI>M.</HI> made a u&s;eful Speech to the Men, and exhorted them to give heed to the Things that had been &s;poken. Religion is likely to go on well, when both the Civil and Eccle&s;ia&s;ti|cal Powers are engaged in keeping up the Purity of it. <HI>But, LORD, unle&s;s thou a&s;&s;i&s;t us, all our Endeavours are but in vain.

Night, admiring GOD's Wonders in the Deep. <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed be GOD for &s;ending us abroad.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Monday, March</HI> 20. To-day Colonel <HI>C.</HI> came to dine with us, and in the mid&s;t of our Meal we were entertained with a mo&s;t agreeable Sight; it was a Shark about the Length of a Man, which followed our Ship, attended with five little Fi&s;hes, called the Pilot Fi&s;h, much like a Mackarel, but larger. The&s;e I am told always keep the Shark company; and what is mo&s;t &s;urpri&s;ing, tho' the Shark is &s;o ravenous a Creature, yet let it be never &s;o hungry, it never touches one of them. Nor are they le&s;s faithful to him: For if at any Time the Shark is hooked, the&s;e little Creatures will not for&s;ake him, but cleave clo&s;e to his Fins, and are often taken up with him. <HI>Go to the Pilot Fi&s;h, thou that for&s;ake&s;t a Friend in Adver&s;ity, con&s;ider his Ways and be aba|&s;hed.</HI> This &s;imple Sight one would think &s;ufficient to confute any Athei&s;t (if there be &s;uch a Fool as a &s;peculative Athei&s;t) in the World.</P>
<P>After Dinner I read Prayers and expounded to my own People; and then went aboard the <HI>Amy</HI> with Colonel <HI>C.</HI> who u&s;ed me with uncommon Ci|vility; married a Couple; and came back to the <HI>Whitaker,</HI> rejoicing to &s;ee the Works of the LORD, and the Beauty of the great Deep. <HI>Who would but come abroad?</HI></P>
<P>Had near two Hours clo&s;e Conver&s;ation with a Gentleman, in whom appear many Marks of the New Birth. Surely he will prove a devout Cen|turion!

<P>The Weather growing warmer, Friend <HI>H.</HI> had &s;ome Cloths hung over to cover his School: His Children come very regular both to learn and &s;ay their Prayers at Night: Capt. <HI>W.</HI> takes great De|light in them: Capt. <HI>M.</HI> much encourages the Sol|diers to read and write; &s;o that we begin to live as regular now as we could wi&s;h to do on Shore. <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed be GOD for thus making his Power to be known!</HI></P>

<P>Had a good In&s;tance of the Benefit of breaking Children's Wills betimes. La&s;t Night going be|tween Decks (as I do every Night) to vi&s;it the Sick and to examine my People, I a&s;ked one of the Wo|men to bid her little Boy that &s;tood by her, &s;ay his Prayers, &s;he an&s;wered, His elder Si&s;ter would, but &s;he could not make him. Upon this, I bid the Child kneel down before me, but he would not 'till I took hold of its two Feet and forced it down. I then bid it &s;ay the <HI>Lord's Prayer,</HI> (being informed by his Mother he could &s;ay it if he would) but he ob&s;tinately refu&s;ed, 'till at la&s;t after I had given it &s;everal Blows, it &s;aid its Prayers as well as could be expected, and I gave it &s;ome Figs for a Reward. And this &s;ame Child, tho' not above four Years of Age, came to Night on Deck, when the other Children came to &s;ay their Prayers to my Friend <HI>H.</HI> and bur&s;t out into a Flood of Tears, and would not go away 'till he had &s;aid his too. I mention this as a Proof of the Nece&s;&s;ity of early Correction: Children are &s;en&s;ible of it &s;ooner than Parents ima|gine. And if they would but have Re&s;olution to break their Wills thoroughly when young, the Work of Conver&s;ion would be much ea&s;ier, and they would not be &s;o troubled with perver&s;e Chil|dren when they are old.</P>

<P>And now indeed we live more comfortably in the great Cabbin than can ea&s;ily be imagined. We talk of little el&s;e but GOD and CHRIST.

In&s;tead of being affrighted at the Approach of the King of Terrors, he welcomed it, and &s;aid he was going to his dear Redeemer; then he fell as it were into a Trance, and poured out his Heart in repeating &s;ome very applicable Ver&s;es out of the <HI>P&s;alms.</HI> Upon which we thought he would have died: But lo!

I could have wi&s;hed for a hundred Tongues to have &s;ounded a loud Alarm to the People; but the Sight of the Corp&s;e, and the Weakne&s;s of my Body, would but ju&s;t permit me to read out the Office. <HI>LORD, what is Man?</HI> Oh why are others taken and I left, but that GOD's long Suffering &s;hould lead me to Repentance? <HI>Grant it, O LORD, for thy dear Son's &s;ake!</HI></P>
<P>In the Afternoon I privately baptized a new|born Infant. Thus it is, &s;ome coming into the World, others going out of it continually. <HI>Good GOD! Who can de&s;ire to live here always?</HI></P>
<P>This Afternoon, after having lain about a Week on this Coa&s;t, we &s;aw <HI>Savannah</HI> River, and &s;ent off for a Pilot. Oh what Joy appeared in every one's Countenance! How infinitely more joyful will the Children of GOD be, when having pa&s;&s;ed through the Waves of this trouble&s;ome World, they arrive at the Haven of everla&s;ting Re&s;t? <HI>Ha&s;ten, O LORD, that happy Time, and let thy Kingdom come!</HI></P>

<HI>Sunday, May</HI> 7. La&s;t Night, by the Ble&s;&s;ing of GOD, we ca&s;t Anchor near <HI>Tyby</HI> I&s;land, about four|teen Miles off <HI>Savannah;</HI> and to-day GOD gave me Strength to preach my Farewel Sermon, (which I have &s;ent you) at which many wept.</P>
<P>After this, I took Boat with my Friend <HI>H.</HI> and arrived &s;afe at <HI>Savannah,</HI> having a mo&s;t plea&s;ant Pa&s;&s;age, about Seven in the Evening. How GOD is plea&s;ed to deal with me here, I'll endeavour to inform you hereafter.</P>
<P>In the mean while, fail not to give Thanks for the Mercies I have received. Though we have had a long, yet it has been an exceeding plea&s;ant Voyage. GOD, in Compa&s;&s;ion to my Weakne&s;s, has &s;ent me but few Trials; and &s;anctified tho&s;e He hath &s;ent me. I am now going forth as a Sheep among&s;t Wolves; but he that protected <HI>Abraham</HI> when he went out not knowing whither he went, will al&s;o guide and protect me; and therefore I cannot clo&s;e this Part of my Journal better than with Mr. <HI>Addi&s;on'</HI>s Tran&s;lation of the 23d PSALM:
<Q><LG>
<L><HI>The LORD my Pa&s;ture &s;hall prepare,</HI></L>
<L><HI>And feed me with a Shepherd's Care;</HI></L>
<L><HI>His Pre&s;ence &s;hall my Wants &s;upply,</HI></L>
<L><HI>And guard me with a watchful Eye:</HI></L>
<L><HI>My Noon-day Walks he &s;hall attend,</HI></L>
<L><HI>And all my Midnight Hours defend.</HI></L>

<L><HI>When in the &s;ultry Glebe I faint,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Or on the thir&s;ty Mountain pant,</HI></L>
<L><HI>To fertile Vales and dewy Meads</HI></L>
<L><HI>My weary wand'ring Steps He leads;</HI></L>
<L><HI>Where peaceful Rivers &s;oft and &s;low,</HI></L>
