<HEAD>The Voyage of Peter Kolben, A. M. to the Cape of Good Hope; with an account of the Manners and Cu&s;toms of its Inhabi|tants.</HEAD>
<P>I EARLY felt an ardent de&s;ire to tra|vel; and, embracing an opportunity that offered, I embarked on board the Union, one of the Dutch Ea&s;t India &s;hips that lay in the Texel.</P>
<P>On the 8th of January, 1705, the Union &s;et &s;ail, with eight more of the company's &s;hips, bound to the Ea&s;t Indies; and, on the 15th of March, &s;teering round St. Jago, one of the Cape de Verd i&s;lands, we had a di&s;tinct view of the rocks and mountains, and of the &s;ituation and extent of the city of the &s;ame name.</P>
<P>On the 10th of June we di&s;covered the Cape of Good Hope; and the next day ar|rived &s;afe in the harbour. Being introduced to the governor, that gentleman, on &s;ight of my recommendatory letters, treated me in a very friendly and affable manner; and &s;oon a&s;&s;ig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> me a very commodious abode.</P>

&s;o early by the Portugue&s;e, as the year 1493. They attempted a &s;ettlement in 1498, but a party of them being cut off, they abandoned the place.</P>
<P>It does not appear that any Europeans af|terwards landed at the Cape, 'till the year 1600, when it began to be vi&s;ited by the Engli&s;h, French and Dutch, in their voy|ages to and from the Ea&s;t Indies. But in 1650, a Dutch fleet anchoring before it, mr. Van Riebeek, a &s;urgeon on board, ob|&s;erving that the country was well &s;tocked with cattle, the &s;oil rich, the harbour com|modious, and the people tractable, dige&s;ted his ob&s;ervations; and, on his return to Hol|land, laid them before the directors of the India company, who, after a grand con&s;ul|tation, re&s;olved to attempt a &s;ettlement at the Cape, without lo&s;s of time. Accord|ingly, four &s;hips were immediately ordered out on that de&s;ign, with all the materials, in&s;truments, artificers and other hands ne|ce&s;&s;ary for &s;uch an expedition. The &s;urgeon Van Riebeek was appointed governor and commander in chief of the intended &s;ettle|ment, with power to treat with the Hotten|tots, in what manner he &s;hould think fit.</P>
<P>With the&s;e four &s;hips, Van Riebeek ar|rived &s;afe at the Cape; and &s;o captivated the natives by his addre&s;s and good humour, and with the pre&s;ents he brought them of bra&s;s

<P>After the&s;e wi&s;e regulations, in which &s;o ju&s;t a regard was paid to the natural rights of the inhabitants, mr. Van Riebeek rai&s;ed a &s;quare fort; and built in it, dwelling-hou&s;es, ware-hou&s;es, and an ho&s;pital for the recep|tion of the &s;ick. To this fort he added pro|per outworks, to &s;ecure him&s;elf from any at|tacks of the Europeans.</P>

this while there was a growing evil, again&s;t which no provi&s;ion had been made. Eu|ropean women were very &s;carce; and tho&s;e they had, were wives, who had &s;ettled there with their hu&s;bands: while the plantation &s;warmed with young fellows, each &s;ettled upon his farm, and in a way of thriving, but wanting wives as much for the &s;ake of i&s;&s;ue and dome&s;tic help, as for &s;en&s;ual gratifica|tions; and yet they had not the lea&s;t incli|nation to marry the Hottentot women. But an account of this grievance being di&s;patched to Am&s;terdam, a fine troop of young women were levied, who, on their arrival at the Cape, were be&s;towed by the governor on &s;uch as wanted wives, with all the indulgence that could be &s;hewn on &s;uch an occa&s;ion, to their &s;everal fancies and inclinations.</P>
<P>The &s;ettlement being thus firmly e&s;ta|bli&s;hed, it increa&s;ed to &s;uch a degree, that being &s;till joined by other &s;ettlers, the Dutch, in a few years, extended them&s;elves in new colonies along the coa&s;t.</P>
<P>The greate&s;t part of the country about the Cape is full of rocks and mountains, which, long after the di&s;covery, being only viewed at a di&s;tance, were con&s;idered as bar|ren: but their &s;pacious tops are covered with rich meadows, every where enamelled with a variety of flowers, of uncommon beauty and fragrance, and abound with delicious &s;prings,
<PB N="5" REF="020444_0007_0FAF108EB5D612F0">
running in many &s;treams into the valleys. The&s;e mountains are in clear weather &s;een at &s;ea at the di&s;tance of fifteen leagues. On their &s;kirts are inter&s;per&s;ed groves, that afford excellent wood for the joiners and turners. The plains and vallies are all delightful mea|dow lands, where nature appears with &s;uch a profu&s;ion of charms as to ravi&s;h the eye of the beholder. They every where &s;mile, and are adorned with beautiful trees, plants and flowers, that fill the air with the &s;weete&s;t odours, among the&s;e are the aloe, and other curious trees and herbs.</P>
<P>The &s;oil is &s;o rich, as to be capable of every kind of culture; it bears all &s;orts of grain, and every kind of fruit-trees. The country abounds with &s;alt and hot baths of mineral waters, that have been found &s;alu|tary in many di&s;ea&s;es. The regions about the Cape are, however, &s;ubject to boi&s;terous winds, that generally blow from the &s;outh|ea&s;t, while the &s;un is in the &s;outhern &s;igns, and from the northwe&s;t while in the nor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n &s;igns. The&s;e winds, however, though they frequently do much damage to the trees and corn, are of &s;ervice in purging the air, and contributing to the health of the inhabi|tants; who, after a calm of a week or ten days, generally complain of the head-ach, and other di&s;orders, which vani&s;h, when the winds blow again.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="020444_0008_0FAF108F713D25F8">Some authors have &s;aid, that the Hotten|tots are &s;o brutal, as to be in a manner, in|capable of reflection, having no &s;en&s;e of re|ligion, nor any notion of order or decency, and &s;carcely po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the lea&s;t glimp&s;e of rea|&s;on or humanity: but this is far from being true. I have known many of them who under&s;tood Dutch, French, and Portugue&s;e to a degree of perfection; and one I knew, who learned Engli&s;h and Portugue&s;e in a very &s;hort time. and having conquered the habit of pronun|ciation contracted from his native language, was &s;aid by good judges to under&s;tand and &s;peak them with a &s;urprizing readine&s;s and propriety.</P>
<P>They are, perhaps, the mo&s;t faithful &s;er|vants in the world. The Europeans, at the Cape, are &s;o fond of them in this capacity, that they are loth to part with them. Though they are infinitely fond of wine, brandy, and tobacco, and will, at any time, part with the mo&s;t valuable things they have, to purcha&s;e them, yet they will neither dimi|ni&s;h, nor &s;uffer any one el&s;e to dimini&s;h the lea&s;t drop or part of tho&s;e commodities, when they are committed to their tru&s;t. It is &s;urprizing to &s;ee the care and fidelity with which they acquit them&s;elves on the&s;e occa|&s;ions. They are even employed by the Eu|ropeans in affairs that require judgment and capacity.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="020444_0009_0FAF109081F85D30">Notwith&s;tanding what has been &s;aid, the Ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tentots &s;eem to place their whole earthly happine&s;s in &s;loth and indolence. They can think to the purpo&s;e, if they plea&s;e: but they hate the trouble of thought, and look upon every degree of rea&s;oning as a torment|ing agitation of the mind: they therefore never rea&s;on but in ca&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity; that is when it is requi&s;ite to remove &s;ome pre&s;&s;ing want of their own or their friends. If the Hottentot is not rou&s;ed by &s;ome pre&s;ent ap|petite or nece&s;&s;ity; he is as deaf both to thought and action, as a log; when urged by the&s;e, he is all activity; but when the&s;e are gratified, and his obligation to &s;erve is at an end, he retires to enjoy again his belov|ed idlene&s;s.</P>
<P>Some authors have &s;aid, that all the Hot|tentots devour the entrails of bea&s;ts, un|clean&s;ed of their filth and excrements, half broiled; and that, whether &s;ound or rotten, they con&s;ider them as the greate&s;t delica|cies in the word: but this is not true. I have always found, that when they had en|trails to eat, they turned and &s;tripped them of their filth, and wa&s;hed them in clean wa|ter. They then boiled them in blood of the bea&s;t, if they had any; if not, they gave them a thorough broiling. This, however, is done in &s;o na&s;ty a manner as to make an European loath their victuals.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="020444_0010_0FAF1091845C7868">But, uncleanly as their manner of dre&s;&s;ing their provi&s;ions is, tho&s;e of them who keep to the diet of their country, have few di&s;|ea&s;es, are &s;eldom &s;ick, and live to an extreme old age. But tho&s;e who drink wine, brandy, or other &s;trong liquors, &s;uffer di&s;ea&s;es before unknown to them, and &s;horten their days: even the meat dre&s;&s;ed and &s;ea&s;oned after the European manner, is very pernicious, with re&s;pect to them.</P>
<P>What chiefly renders the Hottentots a na&s;|ty generation is a cu&s;tom, ob&s;erved from their infancy, of be&s;mearing their bodies and apparel, (which is only a &s;kin thrown over their &s;houlders, and another round their wai&s;t) with mutton fat, marrow, or butter, mixed with the foot that gathers round their boil|ing pots, they being naturally of a nut or olive colour. This cu&s;tom is repeated as often as the grea&s;e is dried by the &s;un or du&s;t, if they are able to get either fat or butter. The meaner &s;ort are mo&s;tly obliged to make u&s;e of that which is rank; but the more wealthy always be&s;mear them&s;elves with the fre&s;he&s;t and choice&s;t that can be had. No part of the body, from the crown of the head to the &s;ole of the foot, e&s;capes this paint; their &s;kins are thoroughly daubed with it. The richer they are, the more fat and butter they employ; for this is the grand
<PB N="9" REF="020444_0011_0FAF10921C632A88">
di&s;tinction between the rich and poor; but they abominate the fat of fi&s;h.</P>
<P>This rubbing and grea&s;ing promotes the &s;upplene&s;s of the body; and the Hottentots though a lazy race, are, perhaps, the &s;wifte&s;t of foot in the world; for they not only dart away from the &s;wifte&s;t European, but frequently out-run a very fleet hor&s;e. Be|&s;ides, living almo&s;t naked in a region where the &s;un's heat is very great all the year round, by clo&s;ing their pores with grea&s;e, they pre|vent that exce&s;&s;ive per&s;piration which would, in all probability, exhau&s;t and de&s;troy them.</P>
<P>What renders them mo&s;t di&s;agreeable, is their &s;uffering their woolly hair to be matted together with fat and dirt; their offen&s;ive &s;mell, ari&s;ing from the&s;e uncleanly cu&s;toms; and their abominable lou&s;ine&s;s. Add to this, their language is a compo&s;ition of the &s;trange&s;t &s;ounds that ever were uttered by any people, and their pronunciation depends up|on &s;uch colli&s;ions of the tongue again&s;t the palate, and upon &s;uch &s;trange vibrations and inflections of that member, as a &s;tranger can|not ea&s;ily imitate, and neither they them|&s;elves, nor hardly any one el&s;e, can de&s;cribe.</P>
<P>The&s;e people are, however, neither &s;o &s;mall of &s;tature, nor &s;o deformed and wrink|led as they have been de&s;cribed by &s;ome au|thors: for mo&s;t of the men are from five to &s;ix feet high; but the women are a great
<PB N="10" REF="020444_0012_0FAF10934F716E20">
deal le&s;s. Both &s;exes are very erect and well made, keeping a due medium between being fat and lean. There is not a crooked limb, or other piece of deformity to be &s;een among them; which is the more remarkable, as they do not take near &s;o much care of their children as the European women. Their heads being generally large, their eyes are &s;o in proportion. Their general mien is &s;o far from being wild and terrible, that it is &s;weet and compo&s;ed, and declarative of the highe&s;t benevolence and good nature. The wor&s;t features they have are their large flat no&s;es, and their thick lips, e&s;pecially the up|permo&s;t; however, the flatne&s;s of their no&s;es is not natural, but cau&s;ed by art. Their teeth are as white as ivory, and their cheeks have &s;omething of the cherry; but from their continual daubings, it is not ea&s;ily di&s;cerned. The men have large broad feet: but tho&s;e of the women are &s;mall and tender. Neither the men nor the women cut the nails of their fingers or toes. But what is very extraor|dinary, all the Hottentot women are di&s;tin|gui&s;hed by having a broad callous kind of flap growing to their bellies, which &s;eems intended by nature to hide, what other nations are taught mo&s;t carefully to conceal; and &s;ome of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">m have it &s;o large, that it can hardly be covered by the piece of &s;heep|&s;kin they wear before them, it being often

&s;een below it. This no Hottentot con&s;iders as a deformity; but through their na&s;tine&s;s and daubings, it is always in &s;uch a condition as to make an European loath the &s;ight of it: yet for a little tobacco they will &s;uffer you to handle and examine it. Thevenot in his travels, &s;ays, the negro, Egyptian, and the women of &s;ome other nations, are &s;ub|ject to the like excre&s;cence; but that they &s;top the growth of it very early by &s;earing: this may probably be done from their con|&s;idering it as a deformity.</P>
<P>In hot weather, the men con&s;tantly go without any other covering on their heads, than the compo&s;ition of fat, &s;oot and dirt, with which their hair is matted together: for they &s;ay, that the fat keeps their heads cool under the fierce&s;t &s;un beams; but in the cold &s;ea&s;ons, and in wet weather, they wear caps made of cat or lamb &s;kins, which they tie on with two &s;trings; but the face and fore-part of the neck of the men are al|ways uncovered. About the man's neck hangs a little grea&s;y bag, in which he carries his pipe and tobacco, with a little piece of wood of a finger's length, burnt at both ends, as an amulet again&s;t witchcraft.</P>
<P>Their kro&s;&s;es, as they term them, or the mantles they hang over their &s;houlders, are worn open or clo&s;ed according to the &s;ea&s;on. The kro&s;&s;es of the mo&s;t wealthy are of tyger
<PB N="12" REF="020444_0014_0FAF10966F660880">
or wild cat-&s;kins: and tho&s;e of the commo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> people of &s;heep-&s;kins: in winter they tur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> them outwards. They lie upon them in th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> night, and when they die, they are tied up and interred in them.</P>
<P>Three rings of ivory they generally wea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> upon the left arm; the&s;e they form from the elephants teeth they find in the woods, which they cut into rings, and fini&s;h with &s;uch art and exactne&s;s as would &s;urpri&s;e the able&s;t turner in Europe. The&s;e rings, or bracelets, &s;erve as guards when they fight again&s;t an enemy, and when they travel, they fa&s;ten a bag to them for the convey|ance of their viaticum, which they fix &s;o cle|verly, that it is hardly any incumbrance. Round their wai&s;ts hang what they call a kull-cro&s;s, a &s;quare piece of the &s;kin of a wild bea&s;t, generally of a wild cat, tied o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> with the hairy &s;ide outward. When they drive their herds to pa&s;ture, they put on a kind of leather &s;tockings to &s;ecure their legs from being &s;cratched by briers and thorns. When they are to pa&s;s over rocks and &s;ands, they put on a kind of &s;andals, cut out of the raw hide of an ox or elephant, each con&s;i&s;ting of only one piece turning up about half an inch quite round the foot, with the hairy &s;ide outward, and fa&s;tened on with &s;trings.</P>
<P>The women wear caps all the year round,
<PB N="13" REF="020444_0015_0FAF10978D114E70">
made of the &s;kins of wild bea&s;ts, that point up &s;pirally from the crown of the head. They generally wear two kro&s;&s;es round their &s;houlders, which, like tho&s;e of the men, co|ver their backs, and &s;ometimes reach down to their hams. Between the&s;e kro&s;&s;es, they fa&s;ten a &s;ucking child, if they have one, with the head ju&s;t peeping over their &s;houlders. The under kro&s;&s;e &s;erves to prevent their bo|dies being hurt by the children at their backs. About their neck is tied a &s;tring, to which is fa&s;tened a leather bag, which they con&s;tantly wear, from morning till night, both at home and abroad; it contains &s;ome kind of food, a pipe, tobacco, &amp;c. The girls, from their infancy to twelve years of age, wear bulru&s;hes tied in rings round their legs, from their knees down to their ancles. The&s;e bulru&s;h rings are then laid a&s;ide, and their place is &s;upplied with rings of the thickne&s;s of a little finger made of &s;lips of &s;heep or calf-&s;kins, from which the hair is &s;inged; for the Hottentot &s;heep have no|thing like wool. Some of the women have above an hundred of the&s;e rings upon each leg &s;o curiou&s;ly joined, and &s;o nicely fitted to the leg, and to each other, that they &s;eem like curious pieces of turnery. They are &s;mooth, and as hard as wood, and make a clattering noi&s;e in dancing. The&s;e rings are kept from &s;lipping over their heels, by
<PB N="14" REF="020444_0016_0FAF1097B6F532D8">
wrappers of leather or ru&s;hes about their ancles; and as the women are obliged every day to walk through bu&s;hes and brambles to gather roots and other things for food, they pre&s;erve their legs from being torn by the thorns and briers. The&s;e rings are one great di&s;tinction of their &s;ex, and are con&s;idered as very ornamental; for the more rings they wear, the finer they are reckoned: but this is not all, they are provi&s;ions again&s;t an hour of hunger and great &s;carcity; for when that arrives, they pull them off and eat them.</P>
<P>But the principal part of the finery of both &s;exes, among the Hottentots, are bra&s;s but|tons, and plates of the &s;ame metal, which they buy of the Dutch, and then poli&s;h to an amazing lu&s;tre; the&s;e dangle in the men's hair. They are al&s;o extremely fond of bits of looking-gla&s;s, which they likewi&s;e fix in their hair, and con&s;ider as very &s;plendid or|naments. Diamonds are not more admired in Europe, than the&s;e trinkets in the Hot|tentot nations. They wear &s;mall ear|rings, made of bra&s;s wire, which they always poli&s;h very neatly, and to the&s;e rings the mo&s;t wealthy and eminent hang bits of mother of pearl, to which they have the art of giving a curious &s;hape and poli&s;h. The&s;e are advan|tages in point of ornament, of which they are extremely proud; for they imagine they
<PB N="15" REF="020444_0017_0FAF10986BCB1710">
draw upon them the admiration of all who behold them.</P>
<P>To their commerce with the Europeans they owe likewi&s;e &s;everal other ornaments for the body, as bra&s;s and gla&s;s beads, of which they are extravagantly fond. Hardly a Hottentot of either &s;ex can be met with, who is not adorned with &s;ome of them. But the preference is univer&s;ally given to beads of bra&s;s, becau&s;e they are not &s;o liable to break as tho&s;e of gla&s;s. They wear them in neck|laces, bracelets, and girdles; of which every one has more or le&s;s according to his ability. They chu&s;e the &s;malle&s;t beads they can meet with for the neck and arms. The large ones they wear about their wai&s;ts. Some wear half a dozen necklaces together, and others more, &s;o large that they fall very gracefully to their navels. They likewi&s;e cover their arms with bracelets from their elbows to their wri&s;ts, which are the large&s;t they can get, and &s;tained with various colours. For the&s;e ornaments the Hottentots part with their cattle very freely. If they &s;erve the Euro|peans, they always &s;tipulate for &s;ome ear-rings, if they are not already provided: and whenever one of them &s;erves a European, though it be but for a week or a day, he hardly ever fails in the bargain to article for beads.</P>
<P>It is an invariable cu&s;tom among the men, to wear the bladders of the wild bea&s;ts they

<P>But with all this finery, the men do not reckon them&s;elves completely dre&s;&s;ed, unle&s;s their hair be al&s;o lavi&s;hly powdered with a pulverized herb called Buchu; and this be|ing done, they are beaux and grandees, and appear in their utmo&s;t magnificence. As the hair of the women is con&s;tantly hid under their caps, they lay this powder as thick as they can upon their foreheads, where, being rubbed into the grea&s;e, it &s;ticks very firmly. The women al&s;o paint their faces with a red earth, with which they make a &s;pot over each eye, one upon the no&s;e, one upon each cheek, and one upon the chin.

He was antiently di&s;tingui&s;h|ed only by the beauty of the &s;kins of which his kro&s;&s;es were compo&s;ed: but the Dutch, &s;oon after their e&s;tabli&s;hment at the Cape, made a pre&s;ent of a bra&s;s crown to the chief of every nation in alliance with them, which they wear upon &s;olemn occa&s;ions. However, in time of peace, the chief has little el&s;e to do but to govern the kraal or village where he re&s;ides.</P>
<P>The captain of a kraal pre&s;erves the peace, and admini&s;ters ju&s;tice; and in time of war has, under the chief of the nation, the com|mand of the troops furni&s;hed by his kraal. His office is al&s;o hereditary, though he can|not execute it till he has &s;olemnly engaged before the people not to alter or deviate from the antient laws and cu&s;toms of the kraal. The&s;e kraal captains were likewi&s;e anciently di&s;tingui&s;hed only by the finene&s;s of the &s;kins they wore, which were tho&s;e of tygers, or of wild cats: but all of them have now a cane with a bra&s;s head, given them by the Dutch, which de&s;cends along with the of|fice.

<P>The captain of a kraal decides all di&s;putes of right and property, and tries and puni&s;hes for murder, theft, adultery, and other crimes

committed within his juri&s;diction, being a&s;|&s;i&s;ted by all the men of the kraal; and from his &s;entence there lies no appeal: but &s;tate criminals are tried by a chief, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by all the captains of kraals.</P>
<P>Whenever a di&s;pute about property ari&s;e, the captain &s;ummons all the men of the kraal into the open field, who &s;quat down in a circle. The plaintiff and defendant plead their own cau&s;es, and the witne&s;&s;es on both &s;ides are heard. The depo&s;itions being fini&s;hed, the captain, after &s;ome debate, collects the voices, and immediately pronoun|ces the decree according to the majority; when full and quiet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion is in&s;tantly &s;ecured to the party in who&s;e favour the de|cree pa&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>The criminal matters which employ the kraal courts are murder, adultery, and rob|bery: for adultery is puni&s;hed with death. When a Hottentot is known or &s;u&s;pected to have committed any of the&s;e crimes, notice is given to all the men of the kraal to which he belongs; who, con&s;idering them&s;elves as officers of ju&s;tice, look out &s;harply in order to &s;eize the &s;u&s;pected party; and it is in vain for him to think of finding &s;anctuary in any other Hottentot nation, for he would be ta|ken up as a fugitive or a &s;py. The criminal being apprehended, he is &s;ecured till the men of the kraal can a&s;&s;emble, which is done the

very day he is brought back to the kraal. The court &s;itting &s;quat upon their hams in a circle, the pri&s;oner is placed in the middle; becau&s;e the Hottentots &s;ay, that in an affair in which a man's life is at &s;take, he ought to have the be&s;t &s;ituation for hearing and being heard. The pri&s;oner being in this place, the charge again&s;t him is pronounced by the pro&s;ecutor, and the pro&s;ecutor's witne&s;&s;es give their evidence. Next the pri&s;oner makes his defence, calling his own witne&s;&s;es, who are heard with the greate&s;t indulgence. Then the captain, after &s;ome debates on the evidence, collects the voices, a majority of which acquits or condemns him. If he is acquitted, the court a&s;&s;igns him damages out of the pro&s;ecutor's cattle. If he is con|victed, and judged worthy of death, &s;en|tence is immediately pronounced: the court ri&s;es, while the pri&s;oner &s;tirs not a limb: for a minute or two, all is &s;ilent; when &s;uddenly the captain flies at the pri&s;oner, and with one blow on the head with his &s;tick lays him &s;prawling on the ground. This is followed by all the re&s;t, who ru&s;h forwards, and &s;trik|ing him with all their might, he in a moment expires. They then bending the corp&s;e neck and heels, wrap it up in his kro&s;&s;e, and bury it with every thing they find about it, except his ear-rings, and other ornaments of cop|per or bra&s;s, which are given to his family

or his heir, who &s;uffer nothing either in name, privilege, or property. His family, relations, and friends are treated with the &s;ame re&s;pect as before: and every thing proceeds as if no &s;uch misfortune had hap|pened. Even the memory of the criminal is &s;o far from being in&s;ulted, that his corp&s;e is interred with the &s;ame ceremonies, and as much pomp as is &s;hewn at the funerals of the riche&s;t and mo&s;t virtuous among them.</P>
<P>All the riches of the Hottentots de&s;cend to the elde&s;t &s;on, or, when a &s;on is wanting, to the next male relation; and the younge&s;t &s;ons of a Hottentot, who are at home and unprovided for at the death of their father, are at the courte&s;y of the elde&s;t, both with re&s;pect to their fortune and their liberty. Marriage with fir&s;t and &s;econd cou&s;ins is for|bidden, and puni&s;hed by being cudgelled to death: but yet a Hottentot may have as many wives as he can maintain though the riche&s;t &s;eldom exceed three. A man may be divorced from his wife, and a woman from her hu&s;band, upon &s;hewing &s;uch cau&s;e as &s;hall be &s;atisfactory to the men of the kraal. But one of the mo&s;t extraordinary of their laws is, that a widow, for every hu&s;band &s;he marries after the fir&s;t, is obliged to cut off a joint of a finger, which &s;he pre&s;ents to her hu&s;band on the wedding-day, beginning at one of the little fingers.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="020444_0023_0FAF109F58B76480">The Hottentots have no lawyers; and the only public officers, be&s;ides tho&s;e already mentioned, are the phy&s;ician and the prie&s;t. In every kraal there is a phy&s;ician, and the large ones have two, who have &s;ome &s;kill in botany, &s;urgery, and medicine. They are cho&s;en out of the &s;ages of each kraal, and appointed to watch over the health of the inhabitants. This they perform without fee or reward, the honour of the employment being judged a &s;ufficient recompence for their trouble. They &s;uffer none to &s;ee them gather and prepare their remedies, for all their preparations are kept a profound &s;ecret; and if a patient dies under their hands, they con&s;tantly a&s;&s;ert that all their medicines were rendered ineffectual by witchcraft.</P>
<P>The prie&s;t is, at the Cape, inferior to the phy&s;ician. His office is al&s;o elective; but he is neither to pray for the people, nor to in&s;truct them in religious matters. He pre|&s;ides at their offerings, and has the ordering of all ceremonies.</P>
<P>As the chief of a Hottentot nation pre|&s;ides over the captains of the kraals, &s;o the Hottentots call the &s;upreme being the great or &s;upreme captain, whom they be|lieve to be the creator of all things and the governor of the world, and that he is endowed with un&s;earchable perfections. They commonly call him Gounja Gounja,

or Gounja Tiquoa, the God of all Gods; and &s;ay that he is a good man, who does nobody any hurt; and that he dwells far above the moon: but it does not appear that they addre&s;s any act of devotion immediate|ly to the &s;upreme God.

<Q>Ah, Sir, (they replied with the utmo&s;t concern) 'tis a Divinity. 'Tis come from heaven: 'tis come on a good de&s;ign. Ah! do not hurt it; do not offend it.

then they apprehend the departed &s;ouls will follow a kraal, and be very trouble&s;ome: they therefore leave the huts they died in &s;tanding, and in them all the uten&s;ils belong|ing to the decea&s;ed.</P>
<P>This is the ab&s;urd &s;y&s;tem of the Hotten|tot religion, of which tho&s;e people are &s;o fond, that I never heard of one of them dying a chri&s;tian. Though the Dutch have &s;ent mi&s;&s;ionaries among them, who have under|gone numberle&s;s fatigues, and taken the greate&s;t pains to make pro&s;elytes, it has been without effect, and they have been compelled with &s;orrow to abandon the generous de&s;ign, without leaving the lea&s;t trace of it on the minds of the Hottentots. Of this the fol|lowing incident may &s;erve for a proof. Mr. Vander Stel, governor of the Cape, took an infant Hottentot, whom he educated in the knowledge of the chri&s;tian religion, and after the genteel manners of the Europeans, allowing him little or no conver&s;ation or in|tercour&s;e with the Hottentots. He became well ver&s;ed in the my&s;teries of religion, and in &s;everal languages; he was always richly dre&s;&s;ed, and his manners were formed after the be&s;t European models at the Cape. The governor &s;eeing him thus qualified, en|tertained great hopes of him, and &s;ent him with a commi&s;&s;ary general to the Indies: he remained employed in the commi&s;&s;ary's
<PB N="28" REF="020444_0030_0FAF10A56A7C7AE8">
affairs, till the death of that gentleman, when he returned to the Cape. A few days after, at a vi&s;it among his relations, he &s;trip|ped him&s;elf of his European apparel, and equipped him&s;elf in the manner of his coun|try, in a &s;heep-&s;kin. This done, he packed up his ca&s;t-off cloaths, ran with them to the governor's, and pre&s;enting him&s;elf before his patron, laid the bundle at his feet, and addre&s;&s;ed his excellency to the following purport:
<Q>Be plea&s;ed, &s;ir, to take notice, that I for ever renounce this apparel. I likewi&s;e for ever renounce the chri&s;tian re|ligion. It is my de&s;ign to live and die in the religion, manners, and cu&s;toms of our ance&s;tors. I &s;hall only beg you will grant me (and I am per&s;uaded you will grant me) the collar and hanger I wear. I will keep them for your &s;ake.</Q>
Here he &s;top|ped, and turning his back, fled &s;wiftly away, and was never more &s;een in that quarter. This man I frequently conver&s;ed with, up in the country, and found, to my great a|mazement, that he had a &s;urpri&s;ing &s;tock of chri&s;tian knowledge. But though I made u&s;e of the mo&s;t per&s;ua&s;ive and endearing language, to call him back into the fold of Chri&s;t, he continued deaf to all my rea&s;on|ing and remon&s;trances.</P>
<P>We &s;hall now take a view of tho&s;e ce|remonies that are generally con&s;idered as
<PB N="29" REF="020444_0031_0FAF10A66AE99880">
of a religious nature, and begin with the marriages of the Hottentots. If a bache|lor or widower has a mind to marry, he di&s;covers his views to his father, and if he is dead, to the next authority of kindred; who if he con&s;ents, attends him to the woman's relations, whom they regale with a pipe or two of tobacco, or of dachu, which they all &s;moke. The father of the lover then opens the bu&s;ine&s;s to the woman's father, who hav|ing heard it, generally retires to con&s;ult his wife, and &s;oon returns with a final an&s;wer, which is generally favourable. If the lover's father receives a denial, which rarely hap|pens, nothing more is &s;aid about it, and the lover at once tears his choice from his heart, and looks out for another. If it be complied with, the lover choo&s;es two or three fat oxen from his own herd, or his father's, and drives them to the hou&s;e from whence he is to take his de&s;tined bride, accompanied by all his re|lations of both &s;exes who live near him: they are received with care&s;&s;es by the woman <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> kindred; the oxen are immediately &s;lain; and the whole company be&s;mear their bodies with the fat, and then powder them&s;elves all over with buchu; while the woman &s;pot their faces as already de&s;cribed, with a kind of red chalk. The men then &s;quat on the ground in a circle, the bridegroom &s;quatting in the center; the women at &s;ome di&s;tance
<PB N="30" REF="020444_0032_0FAF10A79C57A550">
al&s;o &s;quat in a circle about the bride. At length the prie&s;t who lives at the bride's kraal, enters the circle of the men, and com|ing up to the bridegroom pi&s;&s;es a little upon him. The bridegroom receiving the &s;tream with eagerne&s;s, rubs it all over his body, and makes furrows with his long nails, that the urine may penetrate the farther. The prie&s;t then goes to the other circle, and evacuates a little upon the bride, who rubs it in with the &s;ame eagerne&s;s as the bridegroom. To him the prie&s;t then returns, and having &s;treamed a little more, goes again to the bride, and again &s;catters his water upon her. Thus he proceeds from one to the other till he has exhau&s;ted his whole &s;tock, uttering from time to time to each of them the follow|ing wi&s;hes, till he has pronounced the whole upon both: "may you live long and hap|pily together. May you have a &s;on before the end of the year. May this &s;on live to be a comfort to you in your old age. May this &s;on prove a man of courage, and a good hunt&s;man."</P>
<P>The nuptial ceremony being thus over, the oxen are cut into many pieces, and the whole dre&s;&s;ed; &s;ome pieces being boiled, and the re&s;t roa&s;ted in the following manner. A large flat &s;tone is fa&s;tened in the ground in the manner of a hearth, and a bri&s;k fire made upon it, which burns till the &s;tone is
<PB N="31" REF="020444_0033_0FAF10A82D03BE20">
thoroughly heated. The fire is then remov|ed, the &s;tone cleaned from the a&s;hes, and the meat placed upon it. It is then covered with a flat &s;tone, as large as that upon which the meat lies; round which a fire is kindled, as well as upon the upper &s;tone, by which the meat is &s;oon roa&s;ted, or rather baked. The provi&s;ions being thus dre&s;&s;ed, the men and women &s;it in different circles, the bride|groom alone eating in company of the wo|men. They are all &s;o na&s;ty as to u&s;e the lappets of their grea&s;y kro&s;&s;es or mantles for plates; but their &s;poons are &s;ea &s;hells. Din|ner being over, what is left, is &s;et by, and they go to &s;moking; each company having one tobacco-pipe. The per&s;on who fills it, after taking two or three whiffs, gives it to his or her neighbour, and thus it goes round: the be&s;t part of the night is &s;pent in &s;mok|ing and merriment, till the bridegroom re|tires to the arms of his bride, and the com|pany &s;eparate. The next day they again a&s;&s;emble, and fea&s;t and &s;moke as before; and this is continued every day, till the pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i&s;i|ons dre&s;&s;ed on the day of marriage, are con|&s;umed. Upon the&s;e occa&s;ions, they have neither mu&s;ic nor dancing; and they have only their ordinary drink, which is milk and water.</P>
<P>A Hottentot never has a hut of his own, till after his marriage: and then his wife a&s;|&s;i&s;ts
<PB N="32" REF="020444_0034_0FAF10A8F8D2AD38">
him, not only in erecting it, but in get|ting the materials, which are all new, and in providing the furniture. This being done, he abandons to her the care and toil of &s;eek|ing and dre&s;&s;ing the family provi&s;ion, except when he goes a hunting or fi&s;hing: &s;he al&s;o bears a part in attending the cattle.</P>
<P>At the birth of a child, the parents have a &s;olemn fea&s;t by way of thank&s;giving, of which all the inhabitants of the kraal par|take. But upon the birth of the fir&s;t &s;on, the rejoicings are far &s;uperior to tho&s;e atten|ding any other birth. The parents &s;lay cat|tle very liberally for the entertainment of the whole kraal; and every one, on &s;uch an oc|ca&s;ion, is particularly zealous to congratulate them on obtaining an heir. If, at any time, a woman has twins, and they are both boys, they kill two fat bullocks, and all their neigh|bours, men, women, and children, rejoice at their birth, as a great ble&s;&s;ing. The mo|ther alone is excluded from the entertainment, and has only &s;ome fat &s;ent her, to anoint her&s;elf and her infants. However, if the twins are girls, there is little or no rejoicing, and all the &s;acrifice they make is at mo&s;t a couple of &s;heep. On the&s;e occa&s;ions, they often give the lie to tho&s;e thank&s;givings by a cruel cu&s;tom, practi&s;ed indeed by other na|tions, but contrary to every &s;entiment of rea|&s;on and humanity. If the parents are poor,
<PB N="33" REF="020444_0035_0FAF10AA03404680">
or the mother pretends that &s;he has not milk for both the twin girls, the wor&s;t featured of the two is either buried alive at a di&s;tance from the kraal, ca&s;t among the bu&s;hes, or tied on its back to the under bough of a tree, where it is left to &s;tarve, or to be devoured by the birds or bea&s;ts of prey.</P>
<P>An expo&s;ed female infant is &s;ometimes found by an European, when, if it be dead, he generally &s;tays to bury it: but, if it be alive, he always takes it home; and, if he is not willing to breed it up, he ea&s;ily finds tho&s;e that are. The&s;e children always re|ceive a good education; and great care is ta|ken to in&s;truct them thoroughly in the know|ledge of chri&s;tianity, and to &s;ecure them from falling off to the Hottentot na&s;tine&s;s and idolatries; but the&s;e generous labours have never produced any la&s;ting effect. Not once has it appeared that a Hottentot mind is to be deprived of its native bias: for tho&s;e unhappy females no &s;ooner come to years of maturity, than, flying to their own people, they con&s;tantly renounce the chri&s;tian religi|on, with the European manners and appa|rel, embrace the religion and cu&s;toms of their ance&s;tors, and remain with the Hotten|tots ever after.</P>
<P>At eight or nine years of age, the young Hottentot is with great ceremony, deprived of his left te&s;ticle; but the poverty of the
<PB N="34" REF="020444_0036_0FAF10AAC4A16108">
parent &s;ometimes makes it be deferred till the youth is eighteen years of age; this cruel ceremony being attended with &s;ome expence. This is &s;uppo&s;ed to contribute to the agility of the Hottentots: they have al&s;o a prevail|ing opinion, that a man with two te&s;ticles con&s;tantly begets two children; and was a young man to try the experiment, both he and the woman would lie at the mercy of the rulers, and the woman would, for &s;o great a crime, be perhaps torn to pieces by her own &s;ex.</P>
<P>This is one act of legitimation for the mar|riage of the males; but is not the only one. Till they are about eighteen years of age, they are confined to the tuition of their mothers, and live and ramble about with them: there is therefore a &s;econd act of legitimation, by which they are made men. When the father, or the generality of the men of a kraal, re|&s;olve to call a young man into their &s;ociety, all the inhabitants a&s;&s;emble in the middle of the kraal, and &s;it upon the ground in a circle. The young fellow to be admitted, being with|out the circle, is ordered to &s;quat down upon his hams, and then the olde&s;t man of the kraal ri&s;es, and a&s;ks, whether the youth without &s;hall be admitted into their &s;ociety, and made a man? To this all an&s;wering "yes, yes," he leaves the circle, and &s;tepping up to the youth, informs him, that the men

<PB N="36" REF="020444_0038_0FAF10ABFAC0D520">
excluded from the conver&s;ation of the men, till the ceremony is performed over again.</P>
<P>A Hottentot, thus freed from the care of his mother, may be &s;o bruti&s;h and unnatural as to cudgel her, to &s;hew his independence; and it is common for a young fellow on his be|ing admitted into the &s;ociety of the men, to go and abu&s;e his mother, and, as a te&s;timony of the &s;incerity of his intentions to follow the admonitions given him, to in&s;ult and triumph over her, on his being di&s;charged from her tuition.</P>
<P>I have already ob&s;erved, that &s;ome of the Hottentots have a kind of honourable di&s;|tinction in wearing bladders tied to their hair as trophies of their valour. He who has &s;ingly encountered and &s;lain a lion, tyger, leopard, elephant, rhinoceros or elk, is con&s;idered as a hero. Such a per&s;on o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> his return home, &s;quats down; but is &s;oo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> vi&s;ited by an old man deputed by the re&s;t o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the kraal, to thank and congratulate him upon &s;o beneficial an exploit, and to acquain<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> him that the men of the kraal expect him immediately to receive from them the ho|nours that are his due. The hero in&s;tantly ri&s;es, and attends the me&s;&s;enger to the mid|dle of the kraal, where all the men wait fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> him, and &s;quatting down on a mat &s;prea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> for him, all the men &s;quat round him while the hero's face is flu&s;hed with joy&punc;
<PB N="37" REF="020444_0039_0FAF10AE67CE1810">
The deputy then marches up to the hero and &s;prinkles him plentifully as already related, pronouncing over him certain terms, which I could never get explained. The hero, as in other ca&s;es, rubs in the &s;tream upon his face and every other part with the greate&s;t eagerne&s;s. This done, the deputy lights his pipe, and having taken two or three whiffs, gives it to whoever he plea&s;es in the circle; who, having taken the &s;ame &s;olace, gives it to another; and thus it goes round, till on|ly a&s;hes remain, which the deputy &s;hakes upon the hero, who rubs them into the fat on his body with an eager motion, as if he would not lo&s;e one particle of it. The cir|cle then ri&s;es; he does &s;o too; and every one congratulates him on the high honour he has received, thanking him for the &s;ervice he has done his country. The hero now con&s;i|ders him&s;elf as rai&s;ed to the highe&s;t &s;ummit of human glory; and by the bladder of the bea&s;t he has killed, which he wears fa&s;tened to his hair, and the maje&s;tic port he ever after a&s;&s;umes, demands the homage and re|&s;pect which Hottentot cu&s;tom a&s;&s;igns to his high dignity, and which all his countrymen con&s;tantly pay him.</P>
<P>The death of no wild bea&s;t gives &s;uch joy to a kraal, as that of a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">yger. The Hotten|tots are infinitely fond of the fle&s;h, which,
<PB N="38" REF="020444_0040_0FAF10AF693E45F8">
indeed, I found to be mo&s;t delicious food, and much &s;uperior to the fine&s;t veal.</P>
<P>I now come to the la&s;t ceremonies, that have a reference to a private per&s;on; tho&s;e that attend and &s;ucceed his departure out of life. A Hottentot man, woman or child, being in the agony of death, the friends and relations a&s;&s;emble and &s;et up a terrible howl|ing: but the breath is no &s;ooner out of the body, than they join in &s;o dreadful a chorus of &s;creaming, howling, yelling, roaring, and clapping of hands, that it is impo&s;&s;ible for an European to &s;tay in the kraal with &s;afety to his brains. The corp&s;e is in&s;tantly wrapt up neck and hee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s together, much in the po&s;ture of a child in the womb, in the kro&s;&s;e of the decea&s;ed, &s;o clo&s;e that not the lea&s;t part of it is to be &s;een. The grave is almo&s;t always either a cleft in a rock, or a hole made by a wild bea&s;t; for the Hotten|tots never dig one when either of the&s;e is to be found at a convenient di&s;tance. About &s;ix hours after the death, the burial is per|formed. When the corp&s;e is ready to be brought out, all the men and women of the kraal, but &s;uch as are employed about the corp&s;e, a&s;&s;emble before the door of the hut, and &s;quatting in two circles, the men in one, and the women in another, they clap their hands, crying in doleful accents, bo, bo, bo, or father, father. The bearers are na|med
<PB N="39" REF="020444_0041_0FAF10B0AC5CE348">
by the captain of the kraal, or by the relations of the decea&s;ed, and carry the body in their arms. When it is brought out, the circles before the door ri&s;e and follow it to the grave, the men and women in &s;eparate bodies, all the way wringing their hands; howling out bo, bo, bo, and putting them|&s;elves in &s;uch ridiculous po&s;tures, that it is diffi|cult for an European to be pre&s;ent and for|bear laughing. Having put the corp&s;e into the hole, they fill it up with the mould of ant-hills, that it may be the &s;ooner con&s;u|med, and cram &s;tones and pieces of wood into the grave to prevent its being devoured by wild bea&s;ts. This being done, they return to the kraal, &s;quat again in two circles before the door, and for about an hour longer con|tinue their lamentations, till the word being given for &s;ilence, two old men, the friends or relations of the decea&s;ed, enter into each circle, and &s;paringly di&s;pen&s;e their &s;tream upon each per&s;on, &s;o that all may have &s;ome: all the company receive it with much eagerne&s;s and veneration. This being done, each &s;teps into the hut, and taking up a handful of a&s;hes from the hearth, comes out by the pa&s;&s;age made for the corp&s;e, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the a&s;hes by little and little, upon the whole company. This, &s;ay they, is done to humble their pride; to bani&s;h all notions of di&s;tinction; and &s;hew them, that old and
<PB N="40" REF="020444_0042_0FAF10B12EF335F8">
young, rich and poor, the weak and the &s;trong, the beautiful and the ugly, will all be alike, and reduced to du&s;t and a&s;hes. If the decea&s;ed left any cattle, the heir now kills a &s;heep, and &s;ome of his neare&s;t relations, if they are able, do the &s;ame, for the enter|tainment of the kraal. The caul of the &s;heep killed by the heir, is well powdered with buchu, and put about his neck, and he is obliged to wear it till it rots off. The other relations wear likewi&s;e about their necks the cauls of the &s;heep they kill on this occa&s;ion. The&s;e cauls are the mourning the rich Hottentots put on for the dead. But if the relations are &s;o poor, that they cannot afford to kill any cattle for the entertain|ment of the kraal, they &s;have their heads in narrow &s;tripes, alternately leaving a &s;tripe of hair, and another &s;haved.</P>
<P>But they have a mo&s;t horrid cu&s;tom with regard to tho&s;e of both &s;exes who are grown &s;uperannuated. So long as an old man or woman is able to fetch in a &s;tick a day, or can perform an office of kindne&s;s, care is taken to render their lives as ea&s;y as po&s;&s;ible: but when they can be of no manner of &s;ervice, they are by the con&s;ent of the kraal placed in a &s;olitary hut at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance, with a &s;mall &s;tock of provi&s;ions without any one to a&s;&s;i&s;t them, to die of hunger, or to be devoured by the wild bea&s;ts. Cruel as this
<PB N="41" REF="020444_0043_0FAF10B1F6E01C68">
cu&s;tom is, they con&s;ider it as an act of mercy; and are filled w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">h amazement at hearing the Europeans &s;peak of it with horror.</P>
<P>It may here be proper to de&s;cribe the man|ner of building their huts, and di&s;po&s;ing of their kraals. The huts are all oval, about fourteen feet the longe&s;t way, formed of &s;ticks; one end of which is fixed in the ground, and the other bent over the top &s;o as to make an arch: but they are rarely &s;o high as for a man to &s;tand upright within them. The arches being fixed by tying bent &s;ticks with a kind of rope made of ru&s;hes, the whole is covered with mats, which are made &s;o fa&s;t to each other and the &s;ticks, as not to be removed by the wind or rain. Tho&s;e of the wealthy Hottentots have al&s;o a covering of &s;kins: they have no other opening but at the entrance, which is al&s;o arched, and o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">y about three feet high; on the top of which is fixed a &s;kin to be taken up and let down, in order to keep out the wind; and this is the only pa&s;&s;age for the &s;moke. Their furniture con&s;i&s;ts, of earthen pots for dre&s;&s;ing their victuals, and &s;everal other ve&s;&s;els for holding water, milk, and butter. Their fire-place is a hole made in the middle of the hut, and their bed a &s;kin &s;pread in a hole &s;unk a little below the &s;urface of the ground. A kraal con&s;i&s;ts of twenty or more of the&s;e huts, placed near each other in a circle,
<PB N="42" REF="020444_0044_0FAF10B2A8B29C10">
leaving an area in the middle; each kraal containing from one to three or four hundred &s;ouls. The huts of the wealthy are often hung with beautiful &s;kins: and a variety of trin|kets: but though all the Hottentots huts are narrow, dark, and filthy, harmony reigns continually in almo&s;t every one of them; that heavenly charm, &s;o rarely to be found in the palaces of Europe. When a difference hap|pens between a man and his wife, it is &s;oon accommodated. All their neighbours in&s;tant|ly interpo&s;e, and the quarrel is &s;peedily made up. The Hottentots run to the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of &s;trife, when it has &s;eized a family, as we do to put out a fire that has &s;eized a hou&s;e, and allow them&s;elves no re&s;t till every matter of di&s;pute is adju&s;ted.</P>
<P>The cattle of a kraal run all together, and the meane&s;t inhabitant, who has but a &s;ingle &s;heep, has the privilege of turning it into the flock, where as much care is taken of it, as of the &s;heep of the riche&s;t and mo&s;t powerful of the kraal. They have no par|ticular herd&s;men or &s;hepherds, for driving their cattle to the pa&s;ture, and guarding them from wild bea&s;ts. This office they take upon them by turns, three or four of them together; the women milking the cows morning and evening. Between five and &s;ix in the evening, they generally drive them home. In the area of the kraal they lodge the
<PB N="43" REF="020444_0045_0FAF10B4DDE95558">
calves and all the &s;mall cattle, and on the out&s;ide range their great cattle, tying two and two together by the feet. The&s;e are in the night guarded by the dogs, of which every hut has one or two.</P>
<P>The Hottentots have what they call backe|leyers, or fighting oxen, which they u&s;e in their wars, as &s;ome nations do elephants: tho&s;e gore, kick, and trample the enemy to death with incredible fury. Each army has a drove of them, which they take an oppor|tunity to turn upon their foe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&punc; The courage of the&s;e creatures is amazing, and the di&s;ci|pline upon which they are formed, does not a little honour to the Hottentot genius and dexterity. They are al&s;o of great u&s;e to them in the government of their herds at pa&s;|ture, for upon a &s;ignal they will fetch in &s;tragglers Every kraall has at lea&s;t half a dozen of the&s;e oxen, and when one of them dies, or grows &s;o old as to be unfit for &s;er|vice, the mo&s;t &s;tately young ox is cho&s;e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> out of the herd, and taught to &s;ucceed him. The backeleyers know every inhabitant of the kraal; but if a &s;tranger, e&s;pecially an Eu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|pean, approaches the herd, without having with him a Hottentot of the kraal to which they belong, they make at him full gallop; and if he is not within hearing of any of the Hottentots who keep the herds, if there is not a free which he can immediately climb,
<PB N="44" REF="020444_0046_0FAF10B5DFDF1A78">
or if he has not a light pair of heels, or a piece of fire-arms, he is certainly demoli&s;hed. But they no &s;ooner hear the whi&s;tling of the keepers thro' their fingers, or the report of a pi&s;tol, than they return to the herd.</P>
<P>The Hottentots, have likewi&s;e great num|bers of oxen for carriage, whom they break with &s;uch art that they render them as obedi|ent to their drivers, as a taught dog in Eu|rope is to the commands of his ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>The Hotttentots are very expert at &s;everal arts. They point their weapons with iron, which they even draw from the ore: for this purpo&s;e they make a hole in a rai&s;ed piece of ground, and about a foot and a half on the de&s;cent make another of le&s;s extent, to receive the melted iron, which is to run into it by a channel made from one hole to the other. They then kindle a fire in the upper hole, and when the earth about it, is thoroughly heated, put in the iron &s;tones, and make a large fire over them, which they &s;upply with fuel, till the iron runs into the receiver. When the iron is cold, they take it out, heat it in other fires, and with no other implement but &s;tones, beat it out, and &s;hape it into weapons, after which they grind and poli&s;h it &s;o nicely, upon a flat &s;tone, as to render it a valuable piece of work, both for u&s;e and beauty. This inge|nuity is not incon&s;i&s;tent with their habitual
<PB N="45" REF="020444_0047_0FAF10B776ADBDE0">
lazine&s;s: for a poor Hottentot having made a &s;et of arms for his own u&s;e, and another for &s;ale to a rich one, by which he has got two or three heads of cattle, can hardly ever be induced to &s;et his hand to the &s;ame labour a third time.</P>
<P>The-dexterity of the Hottentots in di&s;|charging an arrow, and throwing what they call the ha&s;&s;agaye and rackum-&s;tick, is very a&s;toni&s;hing. A Hottentot arrow con&s;i&s;ts of a &s;mall tapering &s;tick, or cane of about a foot and a half in length, pointed with a &s;mall thin piece of iron bearded, and joined to the &s;tick or cane by a barrel. Their bows are made of olive or iron wood, and the &s;tring of the &s;inews or guts of bea&s;ts, fa&s;tened to a &s;trong wooden or iron Look at each end of the bow. The quiver is a long narrow bag, made of the &s;kin of an ox, elk, or elephant, and &s;lung over the &s;houl|der by a &s;trap fa&s;tened to it; but to the up|per end of the quiver is fixed a hook, on which the bow is hung, when they go to war, or to the chace. The ha&s;&s;agaye is a kind of a half pipe; the &s;haft is a taper &s;tick the length and thickne&s;s of a rake han|dle, armed at the thicke&s;t end with a little thin iron plate tapering to a point, and very &s;harp on the edges. The rackum-&s;tick is a kind of dart, little more than a foot long, made of hard wood. In the u&s;e of the&s;e

weapons, the Hottentots &s;hew &s;uch quick|ne&s;s of eye, and &s;urene&s;s of hand, as I be|lieve no people upon earth have be&s;ides them&s;elves. If a Hottentot &s;ees a hare, deer, or wild goat within 30 or 40 yards of him, away flies the rackum-&s;tick, and down falls the animal, generally pierced through the body. They are not le&s;s expert in the u&s;e of the bow and arrow, for if there be no wind, they will hit a mark no bigger than a &s;ilver penny, at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance. They are equally expert in throwing the ha&s;&s;|agaye, and &s;linging a &s;tone. In all the&s;e ca&s;es they &s;tand not, as the Europeans, like &s;tatues, to take their aim, but while they gather it, which they are not long in doing, they &s;kip from &s;ide to &s;ide, and brandi&s;h and whirl the weapon about in &s;uch a manner, that you would take the whole for idle flou|ri&s;h; but on a &s;udden away it flies to the mark. Their dexterity on the&s;e occa&s;ions is quite incredible, and can hardly be con|ceived.</P>
<P>When all the men of a kraal are out upon a chace, and di&s;cover a wild bea&s;t of any con&s;iderable &s;ize, they endeavour to &s;urround him, which they generally do very &s;oon, tho' the bea&s;t, of whatever kind, betakes him&s;elf to his heels. If thus they en|compa&s;s an elephant, or rhinoceros, they at|tack him with ha&s;&s;agayes, the hardne&s;s and

thickne&s;s of his hide fortifying him again&s;t a &s;hower of arrows. If they do not lay him dead upon the &s;pot, and he is able to return the attack upon the Hottentots, they form as large a ring as they can make, &s;o as to reach him with their ha&s;&s;agayes. The creature be|ing wounded, runs with great noi&s;e and fury at the per&s;on who threw the weapon. Then others attack him in the rear. He turns about, to attack the la&s;t a&s;&s;ailants, and is again attacked in the rear. Again he turns about, and is again attacked. The ha&s;&s;agayes multiply upon his body. He roars, tears up the ground, and has &s;ome|times as it were a fore&s;t of ha&s;&s;agayes upon his back before he falls.</P>
<P>When a lion, tiger, or leo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ard is thus en|compa&s;&s;ed, they attack him both with ha&s;&s;a|gayes and arrows.

avoid him with equal quickne&s;s, and &s;till he fights only with the air. All this time the arrows and ha&s;&s;agayes are &s;howering upon him in the rear. He grows mad with pain, and running and leaping from one party of his ene|mies to another, and tumbling from time to time to break the arrows and ha&s;&s;agayes that are fa&s;tened in him, he foams, yells, and roars in the mo&s;t terrible manner. Nothing in the world can be more admirable than the activity and addre&s;s with which the Hotten|tots e&s;cape the paws of the bea&s;t, and incredi|ble &s;peed and re&s;olution with which they re|lieve each other.

<P>But the Hottentots do not often engage an elephant, a rhinoceros, or an elk after this manner: the elephants, going always to wa|ter in troops in a line, make a path from their haunts to the water &s;ide. In this path <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Hottentots, without &s;pade or pick-axe, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hey have no &s;uch tools, make a hole <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ix to eight feet deep, in the middle of which they fix a &s;trong &s;take tapering up to a point almo&s;t to the top of the hole.

boughs, leaves, mould, and gra&s;s, &s;o that no man living would &s;u&s;pect the trap. The elephants keeping pretty clo&s;e to the track, one or other of them is &s;ure to fall in with his fore feet, when his neck or brea&s;t being pierced by the &s;take on which his whole body re&s;ts, the more he &s;truggles, the farther it penetrates. The re&s;t of the elephants imme|diately make off as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible. Mean while the Hottentots &s;eeing the elephant thus caught, i&s;&s;ue out of their covert, get upon the neck of the bea&s;t, and either break his &s;kull with heavy &s;tones, or cut his large veins with their knives. The carca&s;e is then cut in pieces and carried to the kraal, where all the inhabitants fea&s;t upon it very jovially. The rhinoceros and the elk are al&s;o frequently ta|ken in the &s;ame manner.</P>
<P>The Hottentots are likewi&s;e very dextrous &s;wimmers: this they perform in a different manner from other nations; they beat the water with their feet, and, rai&s;ing them&s;elves erect, paddle along with their necks and arms above the &s;urface. Thus they cro&s;s deep ri|vers, and proceed with great &s;wiftne&s;s in the &s;ea, dancing forward without the lea&s;t appre|hen&s;ion of danger, in the manner which the European &s;wimmers call treading the water, ri&s;ing and falling with the waves like &s;o ma|ny corks. They are al&s;o extremely expert at fi&s;hing.</P>

Generally &s;peaking, however, they part with their cattle, both to the Euro|peans and to one another, at &s;o cheap a rate as is almo&s;t incredible. I never offered a pound of tobacco to a Hottentot for an ox, half a pound for a large &s;heep, and a quarter of a pound for a fat lamb, but the offer was accepted; tho' I had the bargain the &s;ooner, if I offered to crown it with the pre&s;ent of a dram.</P>
<P>The wild bea&s;ts of the country are extreme|ly fierce and &s;avage. The lions here, are re|markable for their &s;trength. When they come upon their prey, they knock it down, and never bite it till they have given it the mor|tal blow, which is generally accompanied with a dreadful roar. When the lion is pinched with hunger, he &s;hakes his mane, and la&s;hes his &s;ide with his tail. When he is thus agitated, 'tis almo&s;t certain death to come in his way; and as he generally lurks for his prey behind the bu&s;hes, travellers &s;ometimes do not di&s;cover the motion of his tail till it is too late; but if the lion &s;hakes not his mane, nor la&s;hes him&s;elf with his tail,

<P>The leopard and tyger, which nearly re&s;em|ble each other, are next in fiercene&s;s to the lion. The tyger is much larger than the leopard, and is di&s;tingui&s;hed by rings of black hair inclo&s;ing &s;pots of yellow: but the black &s;treaks of the leopard are not round, but formed with an opening in the manner of a hor&s;e &s;hoe.

<P>The Cape elephants are much larger than tho&s;e of any other country, and their teeth are from 60 to 120 pounds weight.

<P>The Cape rhinoceros is of a dark a&s;h-colour approaching to a black. His &s;kin is al&s;o without hair, and &s;o hard that it is diffi|cult to pierce it with a &s;harp knife. He is

His mouth re&s;embles that of a hog, and upon his &s;nout grows a &s;olid dark grey horn near two feet long, &s;omewhat bent, with which, when he is angry, he will tear up the ground, and throw &s;tones a great way over his head; and on his forehead is another horn, about &s;ix inches in length, hollow and in the form of a half <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">owl inverted. His ears are &s;mall, and his legs &s;horter than tho&s;e of the elephant. With that animal he is at perpe|tual enmity, and whenever he &s;urpri&s;es him, he rips open his belly with the horn on his &s;nout. He catches the &s;cent of any creature that is to the windward of him, and marches towards it on a right line, grunting and tear|ing his way thro' all oppo&s;ition of trees and bu&s;hes. He never attacks a man unprovoked, unle&s;s he wears a red coat, in which ca&s;e he rends and de&s;troys every thing that &s;tands be|tween him and the object of his rage; if he &s;eizes him, he throws him over his head with great violence, and then feeds upon him by licking the fle&s;h off the bones with his rough and prickly tongue.

<P>The earth hogs in the Hottentot coun|tries are not unlike the hogs in Europe, only they are &s;omewhat red; their heads are longer, their &s;nouts more pointed, and they are quite toothle&s;s. The tongue of this ani|mal is very long and &s;harp.

<P>The porcupines of the Cape are about two feet high, and three long. The body of this animal is armed with a &s;ort of black and white quills very &s;harp at the out-points, and not unlike goo&s;e quills &s;tripped of the feathers. Tho&s;e on his back are about &s;ix inches long; but the longe&s;t are on his hind part: and the&s;e he darts at his pur&s;uer, whether man or bea&s;t; but never does till they are pretty near him, and &s;ometimes does it &s;o effectually that they &s;tick in the fle&s;h, and cau&s;e a vio|lent pain and inflammation. His head and feet are like tho&s;e of a hare, and his ears re|&s;emble tho&s;e of a man. His fle&s;h is whole|&s;ome and well ta&s;ted. This animal does great mi&s;chief in the gardens; and therefore, when the breach is di&s;covered by which he enters them, a mu&s;ket is planted again&s;t it charged and cocked: to the trigger is tied a &s;tring, which runs clo&s;e along by the barrel to the muzzle, where a carrot or turnip is fa&s;tened. The porcupine on &s;eizing this bait, pulls the trigger, and is &s;hot.</P>
<P>The baboons at the Cape are very nume|rous, and frequently enter the gardens and orchards, they being great lovers of fruit. On their entering them, they &s;et a party to

watch upon the fences, and a number of them begin to &s;trip the trees, while the re&s;t &s;tand at a di&s;tance from each other, in a line from the orchard or garden, to the place of rendezvous on the mountains. The fruit, as it is gathered, is to&s;&s;ed to the baboon at the head of the line, and it immediately pa&s;&s;es from paw to paw up to the mountains; they being &s;o very nimble and quick &s;ighted <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s hardly ever to fail catching in their paws the fruit that is thrown to them. All this is done with great &s;ilence and di&s;patch. When the baboons upon the watch di&s;cover any body approaching, they give a loud cry, and the whole troop &s;cowers away, as if de&s;truction was at their heels, the young ones jumping up on the backs of their mothers. It is &s;up|po&s;ed they puni&s;h neglect in the &s;entinels with death; for when any are taken or &s;hot before the alarm is given, a quarrelling noi&s;e is heard among them on their getting back to the mountains, and it is not uncommon to find the bodies of &s;ome of them torn to pieces on the way.</P>
<P>One of the mo&s;t extraordinary animals at the Cape is called by the Dutch &s;tinkbing&s;em, or &s;tinkbox; &s;tinking being the grand defence nature has given this creature again&s;t all its enemies. It is &s;haped like a ferret, and is of the &s;ize of a middling dog. When its pur&s;uer, whether man or bea&s;t, is come pretty near,

it pours from its tail &s;o horrid a &s;tench, that it is impo&s;&s;ible to endure it. A man is almo&s;t knocked down by it before he can get away; and a dog, or other animal, is &s;o &s;trangely confounded by it, that he is obliged every minute to &s;top, to rub his no&s;e in the gra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s, or again&s;t a tree. The &s;tinkbing&s;em having thus &s;topped his pur&s;uer, gets a great way a-head of him before the chace can be renew|ed; and if he comes up with him a &s;econd time, he gives him another do&s;e, and by that means e&s;capes again. Thus he proceeds till his pur&s;uer is &s;tunk out of the field. This animal is &s;ometimes &s;hot by the Europeans, but they are obliged to &s;uffer it to lie till it rots; for it is no &s;ooner dead, than its body contracts all over &s;o nau&s;eous a &s;mell, that if you do but touch it with your fingers, they retain <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;tench, that you can neither endure nor ea&s;ily get off by any kind of wa&s;hing.</P>

<P>At this time a rebellion broke out at Siam, from which we &s;et &s;ail in a &s;mall Chine&s;e ve&s;&s;el.

<P>The city of Pekin, which is exactly &s;quare, was formerly four leagues round: but the Tartars &s;ettling there, forced the Chine&s;s to live without the walls, where they &s;oon built a new town, which, with the old one, com|po&s;es an irregular figure. Thus Pekin con|&s;i&s;ts of two cities, one called the Tartar's, be|cau&s;e they permit none el&s;e to inhabit it; and the other the Chine&s;e, which is as large, and more populous than the fir&s;t; both together being &s;ix leagues in circumference. So that the city of Paris, which is 10,000 paces round, is but half as big as the Tartar's town, and but a quarter as large as all Pekin. In|deed their hou&s;es are generally no more than one &s;tory high, and tho&s;e of Paris are, one with another, five. The &s;treets of the former city are wider; the emperor's palace, which is of a va&s;t extent, is not half inhabited; be&s;ides, there are in that city magazines of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ice for the &s;upport of 200,000 men, and large courts filled with hou&s;es, in which tho&s;e who are candidates for their doctors degree are examin|ed; which alone would form a very con&s;iderable city.

The nobility of China are, indeed, like tho&s;e of other nations, fond of making a great appearance; but they are curbed by the cu&s;toms of the country, and the danger of being taken notice of. While I was at Pekin, one of the chief Mandarines built him&s;elf a hou&s;e &s;omewhat more lofty and magnificent than the re&s;t. For this crime he was accu&s;ed before t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> emperor, when, being afraid of the con&s;equence, he pulled it down while the affair was under examination.</P>
<P>The halls in which they plead, have little advantages above the other hou&s;es. Indeed

they have &s;pacious courts and lofty gates, &s;ometimes embelli&s;hed with tolerable orna|ments; but the inward halls and offices <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e neither magnificent nor even cleanly.</P>
<P>In treating of Pekin, it would be doing that city great inju&s;tice to pa&s;s-over in &s;ilence its noble gates, and &s;tately walls. The for|mer are not like the other public buildings in China, embelli&s;hed with &s;tatues or other cary|ing, all their beauty con&s;i&s;ting in their prodi|gious height, which at a di&s;tance has a fine appearance. They con&s;i&s;t of two large edifices, built &s;eparately, but bound together by two thick and lofty walls forming a &s;quare &s;uffici|ent to contain above 500 men in battle. The fir&s;t building which re&s;embles a fortre&s;s, faces the road. There is no way thro' it; but you enter in at the &s;ide wall, where there is a gate proportionable to the re&s;t; you then <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">urn to the right, and meet with the &s;econd <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ower which commands the city, and has a gate like the former; but the gateway is &s;o <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ong that it grows dark in the middle. There <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hey con&s;tantly keep a guard, and a &s;mall magazine of &s;tores. Tho' the&s;e gates are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;titute of the embelli&s;hments of architecture, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">et on approaching Pekin, the&s;e immen&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">uildings have an air of magnificence preferable <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> our ornaments. The arches are built with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, and the re&s;t with very large bricks, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> with excellent mortar.</P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="020444_0068_0FAF0FAB7087E3A0">The walls are an&s;werable to the gates, &s;o lofty that they hide the whole city, and &s;o thick that &s;entinels are placed upon them on hor&s;eback. Square towers are rai&s;ed at the di&s;tance of a bow-&s;hot from each other. The ditch is dry, but very broad and deep, and the city is as regularly defended by a &s;trong garri&s;on, as if the people were under the continual apprehen&s;ion of a &s;iege.</P>
<P>Among the mo&s;t &s;umptuous buildings of China, we ought not to omit their temples or pagods, erected to fabulous deities by the &s;u|per&s;tition of the princes as well as of the peo|ple. Of the&s;e there are a prodigious number, the mo&s;t celebrated of which are built in bar|ren mountains, to which, however, the in|du&s;try of the people has given the beauties and advantages denied them by nature: the canals cut at a great expence to conduct the water from the heights into re&s;ervoirs made for that purpo&s;e, with gardens, groves and grottos made in the rocks, for &s;helter again&s;t the exce&s;&s;ive heat of the climate, render their &s;olitudes delightful.</P>
<P>The&s;e temples con&s;i&s;t partly of porticos, paved with large &s;quare poli&s;hed &s;tones, and partly of halls or pavilions that &s;tand in the corners of courts, and communicate by long galleries adorned with &s;tatues of &s;tone, and &s;ometimes of bra&s;s.

green and yellow, and at the corners are a|dorned with dragons of the &s;ame colour, pro|jecting forward. Mo&s;t of the&s;e pagods have a great tower &s;tanding by it&s;elf, and termina|ting in a dome, to which they a&s;cend by a hand&s;ome &s;tair-ca&s;e that winds around it. A &s;quare temple commonly occupies the middle of the dome, which is often adorned with Mo&s;aic work, and the walls covered with &s;tone figures of animals and mon&s;ters in relievo. This is the form of mo&s;t of the pagods, and the&s;e are the habitations of the bonzes, or the prie&s;ts of the idol.</P>
<P>The frontier towns, e&s;pecially tho&s;e near Tartary, are fortified with good bulwarks, towers, brick walls, and large and deep ditches filled with running water: in the&s;e all the &s;kill of the Chine&s;e engineers con&s;i&s;ts, which is no wonder, &s;ince none el&s;e were known in Europe before cannon were in u&s;e. Their mo&s;t &s;ingular fortification is the great wall, which extends from the ea&s;tern ocean, to the province of Chan&s;i, and, if all its windings be reckoned, is no le&s;s than 500 leagues long. It is fortified with towers, much like tho&s;e of the cities; and where the pa&s;&s;es might be more ea&s;ily forced, they have rai&s;ed two or three bulwarks one behind another, of an enormous thickne&s;s; the&s;e with the forts that command all the avenues, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> guarded by a great number of forces,
<PB N="68" REF="020444_0070_0FAF0FACF0754DD0">
protect the Chine&s;e from all attempts on that &s;ide. As China is divided from Tartary by a chain of mountains, this wall has been carri|ed not only through the valleys, but over the highe&s;t hills: it is every where of a great height, but rather lower than the walls of their cities, and only four or five feet in thickne&s;s: it is mo&s;tly built with brick, and bound with &s;uch &s;trong mortar, that tho' it is 1800 years &s;ince it was built, it is &s;carce the wor&s;e. This work was at once one of the greate&s;t and the mo&s;t ridiculous ever made by man: for notwith&s;tanding its being extremely pru|dent thus to guard all the pa&s;&s;es and the ea&s;ie&s;t avenues, how ab&s;urd was it to carry this wall to the top of &s;ome precipices which the birds can &s;carcely reach with their flight&punc; and to which it is impo&s;&s;ible that the Tartarian hor&s;e &s;hould ever a&s;cend? be&s;ides, if they could fancy it po&s;&s;ible for any army to clamber up thither, how could they imagine that &s;o thin and low a wall could be any de|fence. Yet it is amazing how the materials were conveyed thither, which was not done without a va&s;t expence, and the lo&s;s of more men than would have peri&s;hed by the greate&s;t fury of their enemies, 'Tis &s;aid, that during the reigns of the Chine&s;e emperors, this wall was guarded by a million of &s;oldiers; but as that part of Tartary now belongs to China,
<PB N="69" REF="020444_0071_0FAF0FADF3880058">
they are contented with manning well the wor&s;t &s;ituated, but be&s;t fortified parts.</P>
<P>There are in China above a thou&s;and for|tre&s;&s;es of the fir&s;t rate; but though the re&s;t &s;carcely de&s;erve the name, they are all well garri&s;oned, whence &s;ome judgment may be formed of the va&s;t armies con&s;tantly kept on foot.</P>
<P>But what is far more a&s;toni&s;hing is the number, the largene&s;s, and the government of their trading towns. The&s;e are generally di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ided into three cla&s;&s;es, the fir&s;t con&s;i&s;ting of above an hundred and &s;ixty, the &s;econd of two hundred and &s;eventy, and the third of near twelve hundred. Be&s;ides, there are near three hundred walled cities, which they con|&s;ider as not worth notice, though mo&s;t of them are populous, and places of trade. The largene&s;s of the&s;e cities is not le&s;s amaz|ing than their number. Pekin is not to be compared to Nankin, or, as it is now called, Kiam-nin, which was formerly enclo&s;ed with|in three walls, the outermo&s;t of which was &s;ixteen leagues round; and though this city has lo&s;t much of its former &s;plendor, yet in|cluding tho&s;e who live in its &s;uburbs, and on the canals, it is &s;till more populous than Pe|kin. The &s;treets are of a moderate breadth, and very well paved; the hou&s;es are low, but cleanly, and the &s;hops richly furni&s;hed with &s;ilks, and other co&s;tly goods. Thither all
<PB N="70" REF="020444_0072_0FAF0FAE905ACC50">
the curio&s;ities of the empire are brought. There the mo&s;t famous doctors, and the mandarins out of employment, u&s;ually &s;et|tle, on account of the convenience of &s;everal libraries filled with choice of good books. Their printing is fairer, their artificers more &s;kilful, the language more polite, and the ac|cent &s;moother than el&s;ewhere. Be&s;ides the ri|ver Kiam on which it is &s;ituated, is the lar|ge&s;t, deepe&s;t, and mo&s;t navigable in the whole empire.</P>
<P>Nankin is famous for what is called the China tower. Of which it may be proper to ob&s;erve, that there is without the city a hou&s;e named by the Chine&s;e, the temple of Gratitude, built 300 years ago by the emperor Yonlo. It is erected on a ma&s;&s;ive ba&s;is built with brick, and &s;urrounded with a rail of unpoli&s;hed marble. Around it are ten or twelve &s;teps, by which you a&s;cend to the lowermo&s;t hall, the floor of which &s;tands one foot higher than the ba&s;is, leaving a walk two feet wide all round it. The front is a|dorned with a gallery and &s;ome pillars. The roofs, which in China are generally two, one next the top of the wall, and a narrower over that, are covered with green &s;hining tiles; and on the in&s;ide the cieling is painted, and formed of little pieces differently wrought one within the other, and this the Chine&s;e e&s;teem very ornamental. Indeed &s;uch a med|ley

of beams, joi&s;ts, rafters, and pinions, ap|pear &s;urpri&s;ingly &s;ingular from our judging that &s;uch a work mu&s;t be very expen&s;ive: but it only proceeds from the ignorance of the workmen, who are unacquainted with that noble &s;implicity, which renders our buildings at once &s;olid and beautiful.</P>
<P>The hall has no other light be&s;ides that admitted at the doors, of which there are three very large ones, that open into the Chi|na Tower. This la&s;t &s;tructure joins to the temple, and is of an octogonal figure, each &s;ide fifteen feet wide. A wall in the &s;ame form is built round it, at the di&s;tance of two <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">athoms and a half, and being of a moderate height, &s;upports one &s;ide of a penthou&s;e which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ues from the tower, forming a pretty kin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of gallery. The tower is nine &s;tories high, each &s;tory being adorned with a cornice three feet wide at the bottom of the windows, and di&s;tingui&s;hed by little penthou&s;es like the former, but narrower, and, like the tower, decrea&s;ing in breadth as they increa&s;e in height. The wall, which, at the bottom is at lea&s;t twelve feet thick, and above eight feet and a half at the top, is all over incru&s;ted with coar&s;e China ware, which has in a great mea&s;ure retained its beauty, though the tower <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">as been erected 300 years. The &s;tairca&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ithin is narrow, and the &s;teps high. Each <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tory has a room with a painted cieling, and
<PB N="72" REF="020444_0074_0FAF0FAFF905B3B8">
in the walls of the upper rooms are &s;everal &s;mall niches, in which are carved idols gilt. The fir&s;t floor is the mo&s;t lofty, and all the re&s;t of an equal height. This tower, from the bottom of the ba&s;e to the top of the cupola, ri&s;es at lea&s;t 200 feet from the ground. Towers of the &s;ame kind are erected in almo&s;t every city, and are &s;ome of their greate&s;t or|naments.</P>
<P>Nankin was once famous for the largene&s;s of its bells; but their weight brought the whole &s;teeple to the ground. One of the&s;e which is &s;till entire, is eleven feet in height, and that of its ear is two feet, and its out|ward circumference is twenty two feet. But this is nothing, when compared with &s;even bells at Pekin, ca&s;t 300 years ago, each of them weighing 120,000 pounds; the&s;e are eleven feet wide, forty round, and twelve high, be&s;ides the ear, which is at lea&s;t three feet: but as much as their bells exceed ours in &s;ize, ours exceed theirs in &s;ound; perhaps chiefly owing to their clappers being o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> wood. The&s;e bells are u&s;ed to di&s;tingui&s;h the watches of the night, of which they u&s;u|ally reckon five.

<P>Of all the public works in China, none do the people &s;uch honour as their canals and bridges; nor is any thing more worthy of the attention of the curious. By means of the&s;e canals the whole trade of the empire is carried on, with the advantage of water car|riage, and in this manner one may travel from Canton, the mo&s;t &s;outhern city, to Pekin the mo&s;t northern, without travelling above one day by land. This, which is called the great canal, is 160 leagues in length. The num|ber of the&s;e canals is very &s;urpri&s;ing; they are often lined on each &s;ide to the height of ten or twelve feet with fine &s;quare &s;tone, and in &s;ome places with a kind of marble of the colour of &s;late. The banks of &s;ome of them are 20 or 25 feet high on each &s;ide, and &s;ome extend above ten leagues together in a &s;traight line. But what mo&s;t charms the eye is the great number of beautiful <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mperial barks, loaded with the be&s;t productions of different provinces; many of them 80 tons burthen.</P>
<P>As in an extent of 400 leagues in length, the earth cannot be every where, level, there are &s;everal cataracts, where the water is precipitated with greater or le&s;s violence, ac|cording
<PB N="74" REF="020444_0076_0FAF0FB47574CC98">
to the difference of the level; but the indu&s;try of the Chine&s;e has found out a means of remedying the inconveniences that might ari&s;e from them with re&s;pect to navigation. At each of the&s;e waterfalls live a number of men who are employed in rai&s;ing the barks. The&s;e having drawn cables to the right and left, to lay hold of the ve&s;&s;el, in &s;uch a man|ner that it cannot e&s;cape from them; they have &s;everal cap&s;terns, by the help of which they rai&s;e it by little and little, till it be in the upper canal, and in a condition to conti|nue its voyage.</P>
<P>In &s;ome places where the waters of two ca|nals have no communication, they have a me|thod of making the boats pa&s;s from one to the other, though the level may be above 15 feet different. At the end of the canal they have built a double &s;loping bank of free&s;tone, which uniting at the top extends on both &s;ides to the water of each canal. The bark is hoi&s;ted up the &s;lope by means of &s;everal cap&s;terns, till being rai&s;ed to the top, it &s;lides down the other bank, like an arrow &s;hot from a bow, and entering the other canal &s;kuds away with prodigious &s;wiftne&s;s. There are no &s;uch ob&s;tructions in the grand canal, and, indeed, the emperor's barks, which are as large as our frigates, could not be thus rai&s;ed.</P>
<P>The&s;e canals are at proper di&s;tances covered
<PB N="75" REF="020444_0077_0FAF0FB6A1D51648">
with bridges of three, five, or &s;even arches; that in the middle is &s;ometimes 36, and even 40 feet wide, and &s;o high that barks may pa&s;s through without taking down their ma&s;ts; tho&s;e on each &s;ide are &s;eldom le&s;s than 30, and dimini&s;h in proportion to the &s;lopings of the bridge. Some of the&s;e bridges have but one arch, which is &s;ometimes &s;emi-circu|lar, and built of arched &s;tones five or &s;ix feet long, and only five or &s;ix inches thick. The&s;e arches not being thick at the top, can|not be &s;trong; but then carts never pa&s;s over them; for the Chine&s;e make u&s;e of porters to carry their bales. Several bridges have three or four great &s;tones from 12 to 18 feet long placed on piers, like planks. There are a con&s;iderable number of this &s;ort neatly built over the great canal, who&s;e piers are &s;o nar|row, that the&s;e bridges &s;eem to hang in the air.</P>
<P>Many of the&s;e bridges are very hand&s;ome: one two leagues and a half from Pekin, was one of the fine&s;t that ever was &s;een, before part of it was b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oken down by a land flood. The whole was of white marble. On each &s;ide were &s;eventy pillars, &s;eparated by car|tridges of fine marble, curiou&s;ly carved in flowers, foliages, birds, and &s;everal &s;orts of animals. On each &s;ide of the entrance at the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> and were two lions of an extraordinary &s;ize&punc; on marble pede&s;tals, with &s;everal lions of

&s;tone, &s;ome climbing on the backs of the great ones, &s;ome getting off them, and others creeping between their legs. At the we&s;t|end &s;tood on marble pede&s;tals, the figures of two children, carved with the &s;ame &s;kill.</P>
<P>One of the mo&s;t extraordinary bridges is built over the point of an arm of the &s;ea. It is 2500 Chine&s;e feet in length, and 20 in breadth. It is &s;upported by 252 &s;trong piers, 126 on each &s;ide. All the &s;tones are of the &s;ame bigne&s;s, as well tho&s;e laid from pier to pier, as tho&s;e that are laid cro&s;&s;wi&s;e. It is difficult to conceive how &s;tones of &s;uch an enormous &s;ize &s;hould be placed with &s;uch re|gularity, or even rai&s;ed to the top of &s;uch high piers.</P>
<P>In the way leading from Han-tchong-fou to the capital, the Chine&s;e have levelled mountains, and made bridges from one moun|tain to another, and when the vallies were too wide, they erected pillars to &s;upport them; the&s;e bridges which form part of the road, are &s;o high, that one cannot look down with|out horror: four hor&s;emen can ride abrea&s;t upon them, and for the greater &s;ecurity, they have rails on each &s;ide.</P>
<P>Kircher ob&s;erves, that in the &s;ame pro|vince is a bridge of one arch, extending from mountain to mountain, who&s;e length is 400 cubits, and its perpendicular height 500 a|bove the Saffron river, which runs under it.</P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="020444_0079_0FAF0FB85BA26EB0">To the&s;e extraordinary in&s;tances of indu&s;try, it will be proper to add, that the road from Signanfu to Hamtchoum, is &s;aid to be one of the &s;trange&s;t pieces of work in the world. I have been told, that upon the &s;ide of &s;ome mountains that are perpendicular, and have no &s;helving, the inhabitants have fixed large beams into them, upon which they have form|ed a kind of balcony without rails, extending along the &s;ides of &s;everal mountains.

<P>One cannot imagine the care that is taken of the common roads: the&s;e are as fine as po&s;&s;i|ble, and are generally near 80 feet broad. At about a mile and a half di&s;tance from each other, are erected wooden &s;tructures about 30 feet high, re&s;embling triumphal arches, with three gates, over which is wrote upon a large <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">neze, in characters of an extraordinary &s;ize, the di&s;tance from the place you left, and how far it is to the town to which you are going.</P>
<P>The origin of the empire of China is as ob&s;cure as the &s;ource of tho&s;e rivers that can &s;carce be di&s;covered. The vulgar hi&s;tory of
<PB N="78" REF="020444_0080_0FAF0FB8EA5F9478">
its monarchy is indeed manife&s;tly fal&s;e, &s;ince forty thou&s;and years are &s;uppo&s;ed to have pa&s;s|ed &s;ince its foundation: but according to their regular hi&s;tory, which none of their learned men ever que&s;tioned, China has had its kings for above four thou&s;and years. It &s;eems probable that the children or grand|children of Noah di&s;per&s;ed them&s;elves into A&s;ia, and at length penetrated into the mo&s;t we&s;terly part of China, where they lived at the beginning in families, and the kings were fathers, to whom a long &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of years, abundance of flocks, and other pa&s;toral riches, added authority. The foundation of the mo|narchy was laid by Fohi, who&s;e wi&s;dom, power, reputation and virtue, together with his great age, made the people li&s;ten to him as to an oracle. He regulated all private, as well as political, and religious affairs: thus the &s;tate &s;oon became in a flouri&s;hing conditi|on. His &s;ubjects at fir&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the province of Homan, and &s;ome years after all the lands and territories that extend as far to the &s;outh as the &s;ea.</P>
<P>The people now principally applied them|&s;elves to the education of their children, and to agriculture, for which they had the high|e&s;t e&s;teem; they were laborious to exce&s;s. The judges and governors of provinces were grave and &s;ober, and by the equity of their deci&s;ions gained the love and re&s;pect of all the
<PB N="79" REF="020444_0081_0FAF0FB9C08A5228">
people; while the emperor placed his high|e&s;t felicity in rendering his &s;ubjects happy, and did not &s;o much con&s;ider him&s;elf the &s;overeign of a grand empire, as the father of a numerous family. By this means the Chi|ne&s;e acquired &s;uch reputation, that they were con&s;idered by all the neighbouring nations as the oracles of wi&s;dom; and it is probable that from their fir&s;t origin they con&s;idered them&s;elves as &s;uperior to all other men; an opinion which they &s;till entertained after they had &s;uffered as great revolutions in morals as in politics; and became &s;o vain, that they fancied heaven had placed them in the centre of the univer&s;e to give laws to mankind, the wretched outca&s;ts who had been placed on the extremities of the creation, and who had &s;carcely the human form. But perceiving the Europeans in&s;truct|ed in all &s;ciences, they were &s;truck with a|&s;toni&s;hment. How can it be po&s;&s;ible, &s;aid they, that a people &s;o far remote from us, &s;hould have any wit or capacity? they have never peru&s;ed our books; they were never in|&s;tructed by us, and yet like us, they &s;peak and rea&s;on right. On &s;eeing our &s;tuffs, clocks, watches, and mathematical in&s;tru|ments, their &s;urprize encrea&s;ed; for they had imagined that expert artificers were no where to be found but in China. They &s;aw that we were not &s;o barbarous as they had imagined, and in a joking way, cried,

<P>The countenance, air, language, di&s;po&s;i|tion and manners of the Chine&s;e, differ not only from ours, but al&s;o from tho&s;e of all o|ther nations. Of the per&s;ons of the Chine&s;e in general we may form a pretty di&s;tinct idea, by con&s;idering that they entertain of beauty. They would have a man tall and fat, with a broad forehead, &s;mall eyes, a &s;hort no&s;e, great ears, a mouth of middling &s;ize, a long beard, and black hair. They are naturally as fair as we, e&s;pecially towards the north; but their faces being continually expo&s;ed to the &s;un, commonly renders them tawny as the Portugue&s;e in the Indies. Tho&s;e in the &s;outhern provinces are of an olive complexion. The learned, e&s;pecially if of ba&s;e extraction, never pare the nails of their little fingers, let|ting them grow an inch long or more, to &s;hew that they are not driven by nece&s;&s;ity to work for their living.</P>
<P>The men &s;have their heads all over, except the crown, where they &s;uffer a long lock to grow; but they continually wear a bonnet or cap, which civility forbids their pulling off. That worn in &s;ummer is the form of a cone,
<PB N="81" REF="020444_0083_0FAF0FBB2B2AB860">
round below, and terminating in a point. It is lined with &s;attin, and the top covered with a fine mat, much worn in the country: to which they add a piece of red &s;ilk, that falls round about it and reaches to the edges; but when they walk, this &s;ilk &s;lows irregularly on all &s;ides, and the continual motion of the head gives it a particular plea&s;ing grace. Sometimes in&s;tead of &s;ilk they wear long hair of a vivid &s;hining red, and this is more e&s;peci|ally u&s;ed when they ride. This hair grows upon the legs of certain cows, and is natu|rally white: but they give it a tincture that makes it dearer than the fine&s;t &s;ilk. In win|ter they wear a plu&s;h cap, bordered with &s;a|ble or fox-&s;kins; the re&s;t is of fine black or purple &s;attin, covered with a flake of red &s;ilk <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ike &s;attin. Nothing can be hand&s;omer than their caps; but they are &s;o &s;hallow, that they always di&s;cover the ears. When the Manda|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ins are dre&s;&s;ed in their formalities, the upper part of the bonnet has a diamond, or &s;ome other precious &s;tone ill cut, but incha&s;ed in a gold button very curiou&s;ly wrought.</P>
<P>Their habit con&s;i&s;ts of a ve&s;t that reaches to the ground, the &s;kirts or &s;ides of which are folded before, in &s;uch a manner that the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ppermo&s;t is extended to the left &s;ide, where it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> fa&s;tened by four or five gold or &s;ilver but|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ons.

It begins with 24 trumpets, adorned with gold coro|nets, and 24 drums, each ranked in two files; 24 men with &s;taves &s;ix or eight feet long, varni&s;hed and gilt, follow in the &s;ame order. Then come 100 &s;oldiers bearing halberts, on each of which is a &s;emicircle of iron, in the form of a cre&s;cent, followed by 100 &s;erjeants at mace, and two officers bearing pikes pain|ted with red varni&s;h, with flowers, and fi|gures in gold. Then appear 400 lanterns curiou&s;ly wrought, 400 flambeaux of a gilt wood that flames like our torches, 200 lances charged with huge tufts of &s;ilk, 24 banners, on which are painted the &s;igns of the Zodiac, and 56 others that repre&s;ent the cele&s;tial con|&s;tellations: there are al&s;o to be &s;een 200 large fans, with the figures of dragons and other animals; 24 umbrellas &s;till more magnificent, and a kind of beaufet filled with uten&s;ils of gold, and borne by the officers of his palace.

After them ap|pear 500 young gentlemen of quality, atten|ded by 1000 footmen, dre&s;&s;ed in carnation &s;ilk bordered with flowers, and &s;potted with &s;tars of gold and &s;ilver. Immediately after appear 36 bearing an open triumphal chariot, and 120 bearers &s;upport another clo&s;e one, &s;o large, that it might be taken for an entire apartment. Then come four chariots, the two fir&s;t drawn by elephants, and the other two by hor&s;es: each of the&s;e carriages is guarded by a company of fifty men: the charioteers of the four la&s;t are richly dre&s;&s;ed: and the ele|phants as well as the hor&s;es are covered with embroidered hou&s;ings.

<P>But notwith&s;tanding this parade, the hou&s;es of the great have neither looking-gla&s;&s;es, tape&s;try hangings, nor wrought chairs: and even gildings are only u&s;ed in the apartments of the emperor and the princes of the blood: all their magnificence con&s;i&s;ts in their cabinets, tables, and varni&s;hed &s;kreens, in their pic|tures, which are not very extraordinary, and

<P>The Chine&s;e painters are very deficient in the art of drawing, particularly of human fi|gures, and they have a very imperfect know|ledge of per&s;pective. Though &s;trangers are not admitted into the bed-chambers, yet their beds are very fine; in &s;ummer they have taffe|ty curtains powdered with flowers, trees, and birds, in gold, &s;ilk, and embroidery. Others have curtains of the fine&s;t gauze. In winter they make u&s;e of coar&s;e &s;attin worked with dragons, and other figures; and their coun|terpanes are in the &s;ame ta&s;te.

the knee. In which po&s;ture the grandees of the court, the princes of the blood, nay, his own brothers, bow to the ground, not only when he is pre&s;ent, but even before his throne. All places in the empire are at his di&s;po&s;al: he confers them on whom he thinks fit, and none of them are ever &s;old; hone&s;ty, learning, long experience, and a grave and &s;ober beha|viour are the only qualifications in the can|didates; but if he di&s;likes their management, he di&s;mi&s;&s;es them without ceremony. He has even the liberty of chu&s;ing his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, whom he may nominate not only from the royal fa|mily, but from among&s;t the poore&s;t of his &s;ub|jects. The old law-givers have from the fir&s;t foun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ion of the government, made it a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> maxim, that a king is the father of his people, and not the ma&s;ter of &s;laves.

<P>Yet every mandarin may tell the emperor of his faults, provided it be in a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive manner: and if he has any regard for his re|putation, the manner in which their hi&s;tories are written, is alone &s;ufficient to keep him in due bounds.

<Q>Such a day, &s;ay they, his behaviour was un&s;ea&s;on|able and intemperate; he &s;poke after a manner that did not become his dignity. The puni&s;hment he inflicted on &s;uch an offender, was rather the re&s;ult of pa&s;&s;ion, than of ju&s;tice.</Q>
Or el&s;e,
<Q>He gave &s;uch and &s;uch marks of his love to his people. Notwith&s;tanding the commendations of his flatterers, he was not puffed up, but be|haved with his u&s;ual mode&s;ty; his words were tempered with &s;weetne&s;s.</Q></P>
<P>That the&s;e men may be neither bia&s;&s;ed by fear nor hope, this office is never opened du|ring the prince's life, nor while any of his fa|mily &s;it on the throne: but when the crown goes to another line, which often happens, the&s;e loo&s;e memoirs are gathered together, and by comparing them, they compo&s;e the hi&s;tory of that emperor, to propo&s;e him as an example to po&s;terity, if he has acted wi&s;ely, or to expo&s;e him to the public cen&s;ure, if he has been negligent of his own duty, or the good of his people.</P>
<P>The emperor has two &s;overeign councils; one compo&s;ed of the princes of the blood alone, and the other into which the mini&s;ters of &s;tate are al&s;o admitted. Be&s;ides the&s;e, there are at Pekin &s;ix &s;overeign courts, who&s;e authority extends over all the provinces of China, and who have different departments

a&s;&s;igned them. One pre&s;ides over all the man|darins; another has the management of the trea&s;ury, and the care of rai&s;ing the taxes; another has the care of religion, arts, &s;ci|ences and foreign affairs; another pre&s;ides over the army; another over the public buildings and palaces, and another takes cognizance of all criminals. In each of the&s;e courts is a cen&s;or, who, though he is not of the council, is pre|&s;ent at all a&s;&s;emblies, and accu&s;es the manda|rins for the faults they commit both in their private capacities and in the execution of their office. Tis &s;aid, that he who undertakes this office can never accept of another, that the hope of preferment may never tempt him to be partial to any one, nor the fear of lo&s;ing his place deter him from accu&s;ing the guilty. Of the&s;e officers even the princes of the blood &s;tand in awe.</P>
<P>The province<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> are under the immediate in|&s;pection of two &s;orts of viceroys; one &s;ort has the government of only one province; and the other have under their juri&s;diction, two or three, and &s;ometimes four provinces, all of whom have courts of the &s;ame nature as tho&s;e of Pekin, but are &s;ubordinate to them. The viceroy, in whom re&s;ides the imperial autho|rity, convenes the principal mandarins of his province to take cognizance of the good or bad qualities of the governors, lieutenants, and inferior officers, and privately informs
<PB N="94" REF="020444_0096_0FAF0FC8AA96EC70">
the emperor of tho&s;e who mi&s;behave them|&s;elves, who are either deprived of their of|fices, or cited to appear and ju&s;tify their con|duct. On the other hand the power of the viceroy is counterpoi&s;ed by that of the great mandarins, who may accu&s;e him when he acts incon&s;i&s;tently with the good of the public, and even the people when oppre&s;&s;ed by him, may petition the emperor for his removal. The lea&s;t in&s;urrection is laid at his door, which, if it continues three days, he mu&s;t an&s;wer for at his peril. It is his fault, &s;ay the laws, if di&s;|turbances &s;pring up in his family, that is, in the province over which he has the charge.</P>
<P>Cau&s;es are generally decided and &s;entence given by a &s;ingle mandarin, who, after a &s;hort proce&s;s, and the examination of both parties, orders the lo&s;er to be ba&s;tinadoed, either for carrying on an unju&s;t pro&s;ecution, or main|taining a cau&s;e contrary to equity. This is the common puni&s;hment for the meaner &s;ort; but cannot be inflicted on a mandarin, till he is deprived of his office.</P>
<P>The next puni&s;hment is a collar, made of two pieces of wood hollowed in the middle, and &s;maller or greater, according to the na|ture of the crime; this is put on the delin|quent's neck, and &s;ealed with the &s;eal of the tribunal, with a piece of paper denoting the nature of the crime, and the duration of the puni&s;hment.</P>
<P><PB N="95" REF="020444_0097_0FAF0FC9B43013B0">The&s;e, except impri&s;onment, are all the puni&s;hments, which the Chine&s;e laws permit the mandarins to inflict on criminals: they may indeed condemn to exile; but their &s;en|tence mu&s;t be examined by the &s;upreme courts. The capital puni&s;hment is &s;trangling. Mean and ignoble per&s;ons are beheaded; for in Chi|na the &s;eparation of the head from the body is di&s;graceful. On the contrary, per&s;ons of qua|lity are &s;trangled, which is a more honourable death: but if their crimes are great, they are puni&s;hed like mean per&s;ons, and &s;ometimes their heads are cut off, and hung on a tree in the highway. Rebels, traitors, the children who murder a parent, and the &s;ervants who murder their ma&s;ter, are cut in pieces. After the executioner has tied them to a po&s;t, he cuts the &s;kin of their foreheads, and tears it by force till it hangs over their eyes, that they may not &s;ee the torments they are to endure. Afterwards he cuts off the fle&s;h from their bodies wherever he think fit, and when tired of this barbarous employment, he leaves them to the tyranny of their enemies, and the in&s;ults of the mob.</P>
<P>As the emperor is con&s;idered as the father of his people, the greate&s;t re&s;pect is paid to the parental authority, and one cannot ima|gine how far this fir&s;t principle of nature is carried. There is no &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, no point of obedience which a father cannot command:
<PB N="96" REF="020444_0098_0FAF0FCA415366B8">
he is an ab&s;olute &s;overeign in his own family while he lives, and at his death, is honoured as a God. He is not only ab&s;olute ma&s;ter of his e&s;tate, which he may di&s;tribute to whom he plea&s;es; but al&s;o of his concubines and children, whom he may even &s;ell to &s;trangers, if their behaviour di&s;plea&s;es him; and if a fa|ther accu&s;es his &s;on of any crime before a mandarin, there needs no proof of it; for if a father complains, they make no doubt but that the &s;on is in the fault. If a &s;on is &s;o wicked as to mock his parents&punc; or if he arrives at &s;uch a height of madne&s;s as to lay violent hands on them, the province where it is done, is alarmed; the emperor him&s;elf judges the criminal; all the mandarins near the place are turned out, e&s;pecially tho&s;e of that town, who have been &s;o negligent in their in&s;tructi|ons. The neighbours are all reprimanded for neglecting, by former puni&s;hments, to &s;top the iniquity of the criminal before it aro&s;e to &s;uch a height; for they &s;uppo&s;e that &s;uch a diabolical di&s;po&s;ition mu&s;t have &s;hewn it&s;el<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> on other occa&s;ions, and that it is impo&s;&s;ible to arrive at &s;uch a pitch of wickedne&s;s at once.

The mourning colour is white. The funeral is pompous and expen|sive, and a &s;on will &s;ometimes &s;ell him&s;elf to buy a magnificent coffin for his father.

<P>The Chine&s;e are pagans of &s;everal &s;ects: one of the principal of which is compo&s;ed of the wor&s;hippers of Foe or Fo; a religion brought from India. The&s;e believe tran&s;mi|gration, and their bonzes, or prie&s;ts, who are frequently great hypocrites, gro&s;ly impo&s;e on the credulity of the people. Two of the&s;e bonzes one day &s;eeing two large ducks in a rich farmer's yard, fell on their faces before the door, and bur&s;ting into bitter lamentati|ons, the good woman, who &s;aw them from the chamber window, came down to a&s;k the cau&s;e of their affliction. They informed her, that the &s;ouls of their fathers inhabited the bo|dies of tho&s;e creatures; and that the dread of her killing them, was what they could not &s;upport. The woman an&s;wered that &s;he in|tended to &s;ell them; but as they were thei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> fathers, &s;he would keep them &s;afe. But, per|haps, &s;aid the bonzes, your hu&s;band will no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> be &s;o charitable, and then if any acciden<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;hould happen to them, it would kill us. A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> la&s;t, after a long di&s;cour&s;e, the good woman was &s;o far moved by their tears and importuni|ty, that to comfort them, &s;he committed th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> two ducks to their care, and allowed them to
<PB N="103" REF="020444_0105_0FAF0FD32F9BA328">
keep them for &s;ome time. They took them with the appearance of the greate&s;t re&s;pect; and pro&s;trated them&s;elves before the uncon|&s;cious ducks; but that very evening made an entertainment for &s;ome others of their order, and the ducks were eaten for &s;upper.</P>
<P>They likewi&s;e get money from the people by public acts of penance, which are &s;ure to procure them the e&s;teem and compa&s;&s;ion of the ignorant multitude. I have &s;een them drag|ging a long iron chain, as thick as one's arm, and about 30 feet long, fa&s;tened to their neck or legs. Thus it is, &s;ay they, at every door as they pa&s;s, that we expiate your faults; and &s;ure this de&s;erves &s;ome alms. Others in pub|lic places &s;trike their heads with large bricks, till they are almo&s;t covered with blood. One day I met in the middle of a town, a young bonze, of a good mein, and with &s;uch an in|genuous and mode&s;t look as might ea&s;ily move compa&s;&s;ion. He &s;tood upright in a &s;ort of &s;e|d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n, the in&s;ide of which was like a barrow, full of nails with the points &s;ticking inward, &s;o that he could bend no way without being wounded. Two fellows were hired to carry him from hou&s;e to hou&s;e, while he endeavour|ed to excite compa&s;&s;ion, by telling the people that he was &s;hut up in that chair for the good of their &s;ouls, and was re&s;olved never to leave it till they had bought all the nails, of which there were above 2000, at the value of &s;ix-pence
<PB N="104" REF="020444_0106_0FAF0FD3E974CEE8">
each; the &s;malle&s;t of which, he &s;aid, would derive incomparable ble&s;&s;ings on them|&s;elves and families; &s;ince their charity would be be&s;towed o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the God Fo, to who&s;e honour they were going to build a temple. The bonze directing his di&s;cour&s;e to me, I advi&s;ed him to leave his pri&s;on, and go to the temple of the true God, to be in&s;tructed in heavenly truths, where he might &s;ubmit to penances le&s;s &s;evere, but more whole&s;ome. He calmly replied, that he was obliged to me for my advice; but would be much more &s;o, if I would buy a do|zen of his nails, which would certainly pro|cure me a good journey. Here, hold your hand, &s;aid he, take the&s;e, on the faith of a bonze, they are the be&s;t in all my &s;edan, for they prick me the mo&s;t, yet you &s;hall have them at the &s;ame rate, at which I &s;ell the others. The tone in which he uttered the&s;e words would, on another occa&s;ion, have made me laugh: but I left him with a mixture of pity and contempt.</P>
<P>The Chine&s;e are, however, &s;ometimes wea|ry of paying u&s;ele&s;s addre&s;&s;es to their idols, which are very numerous: for it often hap|pens, that if after wor&s;hipping them a great while, the people do not obtain the ble&s;&s;ing they de&s;ire, they u&s;e them in the mo&s;t re|proachful manner; &s;ome load them with hard names, and others with hard blows: we lodge you, &s;ay they, in a magnificent temple, we
<PB N="105" REF="020444_0107_0FAF0FD4AE8D6390">
cover you with gold, and offer to you food and incen&s;e, and after all you are &s;o ungrate|ful as to refu&s;e our reque&s;ts. They then tie the idol with cords, pluck it down, drag it along the &s;treets, through all the mud and dunghills. Yet if they &s;oon after obtain their de&s;ire, they then take the idol, and with great ceremony carry it back, and place it again on its niche, after they have wa&s;hed it clean, fall|en down before it, and made excu&s;es for what they have done; promi&s;ing that if it will for|get what is pa&s;t, they will gild it again.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;ects are, however, only tolerated; the religion of the court, and that of the mandarins, con&s;i&s;ts in following the precepts and doctrines of Confucius, an excellent moral philo&s;opher, and tho&s;e of the other &s;ages of antiquity; which they have intermixed with many idolatrous and &s;uper&s;titious cu&s;toms. They are far from ab&s;taining from fle&s;h: and almo&s;t all the people not only feed on the animals that are u&s;ually eaten in other coun|tries; but on cats, dogs and hor&s;es, and even on &s;uch creatures as die of them&s;elves; though their principal food is hogs.</P>
<P>The Chine&s;e in writing do not u&s;e pens made of quills, like the Europeans, nor canes or reeds like the Arabians, nor crayons like the Siame&s;e; but only hair pencils. When they &s;it down to write, they have upon the table a piece of poli&s;hed marble, with a hollow at
<PB N="106" REF="020444_0108_0FAF0FD5701130E8">
one end, that contains a little water, into which dipping a &s;tick of Indian ink, they rub it upon the &s;mooth part of the marble, and into the liquid ink thus made, dip their pen|cil. Every word has a different character; for they have no idea of expre&s;&s;ing &s;ounds on paper, by the letters of an alphabet. They write from the right to the left, and end their books where we begin ours; &s;o that our la&s;t page &s;tands in the place of their fir&s;t.</P>
<P>The Chine&s;e paper is made of the inner bark of the bamboo, which is &s;oft and white: this they beat in clear water; after which it is formed into &s;heets by being taken up in long and broad frames. Some of the&s;e &s;heets are ten or twelve feet long; they are exceed|ing white and &s;mooth, and each &s;heet is dip|ped in allum water, in&s;tead of &s;ize. They have al&s;o paper made of cotton, which is, in|deed, the white&s;t, fine&s;t and mo&s;t u&s;ed.</P>
<P>Printing, which is in a manner in its infan|cy in Europe, has been u&s;ed from all anti|quity in China: but their manner of printing is very different from ours. As they have no letters, they are obliged to cut the marks which &s;tand for words on even blocks of wood. He who intends to print a book, has it fairly wrote, and then the wood cutter glews each leaf upon an even &s;mooth pear-tree board, and cuts out whatever is not to appear when
<PB N="107" REF="020444_0109_0FAF0FD62B253250">
printed, leaving the characters as perfect as tho&s;e of the original. Having thus prepared the block, they rub it over with a bru&s;h dip|ped in ink, and placing the paper upon it, they rub a dry bru&s;h gently over the back of the paper, pre&s;&s;ing it down a little, that it may imbibe the ink&punc; and take the impre&s;&s;ion. All this is done with great expedition. They print only on one &s;ide of the leaf, and fini&s;h a whole book in the manner here de&s;cribed; after which it is bound, and covered either with a neat &s;ort of grey pa&s;teboard, or with fine &s;attin or flowered &s;ilk, which co&s;ts little, and &s;ome are covered by the binders with red brocade, inter&s;per&s;ed with gold and &s;ilver flowers.</P>
<P>The Chine&s;e have a variety of books on morality, medicine, on agriculture, on plants, on the military arts, on hi&s;tory, a&s;tronomy, philo&s;ophy, and the mechanic art, romances, comedies, tragedies, and abundance of treati|es compo&s;ed by the bonzes, on the wor&s;hip of the deities of the country: &s;o that &s;ome of their public libraries are &s;aid to contain 40,000 volumes.</P>
<P>The Chine&s;e are well &s;killed in the manage|ment of the &s;ilk-worm, and in rai&s;ing and ma|nufacturing the riche&s;t &s;ilks; in making cabi|nets re&s;embling tho&s;e of Japan; and are parti|cularly famous for their porcelain, &s;o well known in Europe by the name of China.</P>

employed in nothing but levelling them; and their manner of meliorating their ground be|ing to let water through it, they could not think of a better way of rendering the whole country fertile, than that they have taken; for was it not for their numerous canals, tho&s;e parts that lie highe&s;t would have been &s;ubject to continual drought, and the re&s;t have lain always under water. Their mountains are cut out like a pair of &s;tairs, from the top to the bottom, that the rain-water may &s;pread equally, and not wa&s;h down the ground with its &s;eeds. A long &s;eries of &s;uch hills, &s;ur|rounded with &s;uch terra&s;&s;es, lo&s;ing in breadth as they gain in height, afford a very entertain|ing land&s;cape.</P>
<P>Their mountains are, for the mo&s;t part, le&s;s &s;tony than ours, and covered with a mould that is light, porous, and ea&s;ily cut; and what is mo&s;t &s;urpri&s;ing, &s;o deep, that in mo&s;t provinces you may dig three or four hundred feet in depth before you come to the hard rock. Nature, however, has not every where equally di&s;tributed her favours; for &s;ome pla|ces are naturally &s;o fertile, as to yield two crops a year; while others owe their fruitful|ne&s;s to the indefatigable labour of the hu&s;|bandmen.

quantities of it into the plains, and a number of people are &s;olely employed in looking for it among the &s;and and mud, where it is found &s;o pure as to need no refining.</P>
<P>The mines of common copper &s;upply the empire with &s;mall money. But the mo&s;t ex|traordinary &s;ort of this metal is white copper, which is of that colour when dug out of the mine, and more &s;o on the in&s;ide than without. It appears by many experiments made at Pe|kin, that its colour is owing to no mixture: on the contrary, all mixtures dimini&s;h its beauty; for when it is rightly managed, it looks exactly like &s;ilver; but there is a ne|ce&s;&s;ity of mixing a &s;mall quantity of &s;ome o|ther metal with it, to &s;often it and prevent its brittlene&s;s; and therefore tho&s;e who would have it keep its fine colour, mix it with a fifth part of &s;ilver.</P>
<P>There are in China al&s;o many mines of pit-coal, of which there is a very great con&s;ump|tion. In the mountains are found lapis arme|nus, cinnabar, vitriol, allum, ja&s;per, rubies, rock cry&s;tal, load-&s;tones, porphyry, and quarries of different kinds of marble.</P>
<P>The canals of China have been mentioned among the works which &s;hew the art and in|du&s;try of the inhabitants; and the rivers from whence they derive their &s;ources are very con|&s;iderable. The river Kiam ri&s;es in the pro|vince of Yunnan, and after having watered

three other provinces, and run a cour&s;e of 400 leagues, di&s;charges it&s;elf into the ea&s;tern &s;ea. The Chine&s;e have a proverb, that "The &s;ea has no bounds, and the Kiam no bottom:" and indeed in &s;ome places they have found none; but as their pilots never carry a cord of above fifty or &s;ixty fathoms in length, the impo&s;&s;ibility of finding a bottom with their ordinary plummet, probably gave ri&s;e to this hyperbole. This river is in many places extremely rapid, and the pa&s;&s;age along it is very dangerous.</P>
<P>China abounds with lakes, one of which named the Jau, is thirty leagues in circumfe|rence, and is like the &s;ea, &s;ubject to &s;torms: indeed almo&s;t every province, has lakes of a prodigious extent; the&s;e have a communica|tion with the rivers and canals, and are well &s;tocked with fi&s;h.</P>
<P>The plains are extremely beautiful, they are all cultivated, and &s;o afraid are the inhabi|tants of lo&s;ing an inch of ground, that they have neither hedge nor ditch. All the nor|thern and we&s;tern provinces bear wheat, bar|ley, &s;everal kinds of millet and tobacco, with black and yellow pea&s;e, with which they feed their hor&s;es, as we do with oats: the plains to the &s;outh, being a watery country, pro|duce rice.

<P>The &s;oil is proper for all manner of fruits; it produces apricots, peaches, pears, apples, &s;igs, grapes of all kinds, and e&s;pecially excel|lent mu&s;cadines. There are al&s;o pomegra|nates, walnuts, che&s;nuts; and in general all that we have in Europe; but as the Chine&s;e are &s;trangers to the art of grafting, they are for the mo&s;t part inferior in goodne&s;s to ours, and there is no great variety among each di&s;|tinct &s;ort.</P>
<P>In the &s;outhern provinces grow other fruits that are in greater e&s;teem among the natives; for be&s;ides oranges of &s;everal kinds, lemons and citrons, which were many years ago brought into Europe, there are other fruits that have a fine ta&s;te and flavour, that &s;eem peculiarly natives of the country; particularly what they call the linchi, which is of the &s;ize of a date, and has a &s;oft pulp of a very agree|able ta&s;te, which it partly lo&s;es on its becom|ing dry and wrinkled like a prune. Ananas, gauvas, bananas and cocoas have been tran&s;|planted from the neighbouring i&s;lands. Be|&s;ides the&s;e there is a tree which bears a &s;mall fruit that in &s;hape, colour, &s;hell, and ta&s;te, is extremely like a pea. This tree is common in &s;everal provinces, and in re&s;pect to its

height, its &s;preading branches, and the thick|ne&s;s of its trunk, is excelled by few.</P>
<P>Among their trees are the four following. The fir&s;t is the varni&s;h tree, which is of a &s;mall &s;ize, and has a leaf re&s;embling the wild cherry: a gum di&s;tils from it drop by drop like the tears of the turpentine-tree; and if an inci&s;ion be made in it, it yields a greater quantity of liquor; but then it &s;oon de&s;troys the tree. The varni&s;h is much u&s;ed, and is greatly e&s;teemed by the artificers: it takes all colours alike, and if it be well managed, neither lo&s;es its lu&s;tre by the change of the air, nor the age of the wood to which it is appli|ed.</P>
<P>There is al&s;o another tree from which a liquor is obtained that differs but little from varni&s;h.</P>
<P>Another is termed the tallow-tree. This is as large as a high cherry-tree: the leaves are of a lively red, and the &s;hape of a heart; the fruit is contained in a rind, which, when ripe, opens in the middle like a che&s;|nut: it con&s;i&s;ts of white kernels of the &s;ize of a hazel-nut, who&s;e pulp has the proper|ties of tallow, and of which candles are ac|cordingly made.</P>
<P>The white wax-tree is no le&s;s extraordina|ry. It is not &s;o tall as the tallow-tree; and has longer leaves and a whiter bark. A &s;mall kind of worm fixes it&s;elf to the leaves, and
<PB N="117" REF="020444_0119_0FAF0FE1A0570998">
forms a &s;ort of comb, much &s;maller than an honey-comb, the wax of which is very hard and &s;hining, and of far greater value than the common bees-wax.</P>
<P>They have mo&s;t kind of woods that are to be found in Europe, and &s;everal others, a|mong which is the t&s;e-tam, or ro&s;e-wood, which is of a reddi&s;h black, and full of fine veins that &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ems painted. This wood is fit for the fine&s;t &s;ort of joiner's work.</P>
<P>Among the &s;hrubs, the mo&s;t extraordinary is that of tea, which is di&s;tingui&s;hed into &s;e|veral different &s;orts. One of the principal of them is the &s;ong-lo, which we call green tea. It is planted in the manner of vines, and if not cut, will grow &s;even or eight feet high. The flower is white, and in the &s;hape of a ro&s;e, in the autumn; when it drops off, there appears a berry in &s;hape of a nut, a little moi&s;t, and of no bad ta&s;te.</P>
<P>There is another &s;ort of the tea &s;hrub which grows in the province of Fo-kien, and is call|ed vui, or bohea. The only difference be|tween this tea and the former, is, that the leaves of that are longer and &s;harper pointed, and tho&s;e of the latter of a darker colour. This la&s;t being e&s;teemed more &s;alutary is mo&s;t generally u&s;ed throughout the empire</P>
<P>From this &s;hrub are prepared three &s;orts of tea; the fir&s;t, of the tender leaf when newly planted, which is &s;eldom expo&s;ed to &s;ale; but
<PB N="118" REF="020444_0120_0FAF0FE2318381B0">
&s;erves to make pre&s;ents of, and to &s;end to the emperor: this is called man-cha, or imperial tea. The &s;econd con&s;i&s;ts of leaves of a &s;en|&s;ible growth, and is e&s;teemed a very good &s;ort. The remaining leaves are &s;uffered to arrive at their full growth, and this makes a third &s;ort; and a fourth is made of the flower it&s;elf.</P>
<P>There are al&s;o &s;everal other kinds of teas: but they are very little different from the two principal &s;orts, except in what is owing to the nature of the &s;oil in which they are plan|ted.</P>
<P>The flowering trees and &s;hrubs are very numerous throughout the empire. In th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e the Chine&s;e have the advantage of the Euro|peans, as the Europeans have of them with re|gard to the flowers that &s;pring from &s;eeds, and &s;mall roots. Large trees are to be &s;een there that perfectly re&s;emble tulips; the flowers of others are like ro&s;es, which intermixed with the green leaves, make a very beautiful ap|pearance.</P>
<P>Among the animals is an odoriferous deer, which is without horns; the hair is of a blacki&s;h colour; and its mu&s;k-bag is com|po&s;ed of a very thin &s;kin, covered with ex|ceeding fine hair; the fle&s;h is good to eat, and &s;erved up at the be&s;t tables.</P>
<P>Among the other animals hor&s;es, which are very indifferent, &s;mall a&s;&s;es and mules,
<PB N="119" REF="020444_0121_0FAF0FE304976E28">
&s;ome cows and buffaloes, white goats and black hogs, which la&s;t are excellent food, greatly &s;uperior to the pork of Europe. There are al&s;o a prodigious number of bucks, does, wild boars, elks, hares, rabbits, and &s;quirrels.</P>
<P>In the &s;outhern provinces are parrots of all &s;orts, exactly re&s;embling tho&s;e brought from America. They have the &s;ame plumage, and the &s;ame aptne&s;s for talking: but they are not comparable to the bird called the golden hen. There is no bird in Europe any thing like it. The liveline&s;s of the red and yellow, the plume on the head, the delicate &s;hadow|ing of the tail, the variety of colours in the wings, together with a well &s;haped body, render it the mo&s;t beautiful of the feathered kind; be&s;ides, the fle&s;h is more delicate than that of the phea&s;ant.</P>
<P>I cannot conclude this account of China without mentioning a &s;ingular method by which all kinds of fi&s;h are di&s;per&s;ed into diffe|rent provinces even before they have life. About the month of may the Chine&s;e draw mats acro&s;s the great river Yang-t&s;e-Kyange in order to &s;top the &s;pawn, which they know how to di&s;tingui&s;h at fir&s;t &s;ight, tho' the water is &s;carce altered by it, with this water mixed with &s;pawn, they fill many ve&s;&s;els, which they &s;ell to the merchants, who go thither at that &s;ea&s;on in great numbers to buy

It is almo&s;t &s;uperfluous to mention here, that the elephant's &s;kin is of an a&s;h grey colour, &s;mooth&punc; and without &s;cales; and that there is only one part of him in which he is vulnerable by a mu&s;|ket &s;hot, and that is, between the eye and the ear.

<P N="1">I. A certain korahl has been u&s;ed for the&s;e many years pa&s;t, in which mo&s;t of the elephants in Ceylon are caught.

The&s;e trees &s;tand very clo&s;e and near to each other; and where there is any gap, very &s;trong pali&s;ades are brought to fill it up, &s;o that the elephants cannot by any means get out. As &s;oon as the hunters have given information that they have di&s;covered a tolerable numerous troop of elephants, the principal people of Ceylon are obliged to bring together &s;everal thou&s;and men. By means of the&s;e the whole drove, thus inclo&s;ed is driven &s;lowly towards the fir&s;t opening of the korahl, that takes up an enormous &s;pace. When they have got them thus far, the game is, as it were in their hands. The whole train of hunt&s;|men and country people now unite, and draw up clo&s;e into this opening, and making a great noi&s;e and uproar, as well by their cries as in&s;truments, which they carry with them for the purpo&s;e, they contrive to get the elephants, who keep to|gether in one drove, like a happy and peaceful family, into the &s;maller &s;pace, which is called the &s;porting korahl. Here there is likewi&s;e formed a pali&s;adoe (as it were) of &s;ix or &s;even thou&s;and men, who make a large fire, and at the &s;ame time an intolerable din with &s;houting, drumming and playing on the hautboy of that country, &s;o that the elephants are frightened; and in&s;tead of going backwards, move forwards towards the &s;malle&s;t &s;pace, called the <HI>f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rn hope.</HI> This <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">rait is clo&s;ed likewi&s;e with a large <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e, and a g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eat clamour is made as before; by

He now ob&s;erves, that the fire comes nearer and nearer to him; accordingly he ventures into the &s;mall out|let of the korahl: and &s;eeing the tame elephants &s;tand at the end of it, imagines that he has at length obtained his freedom. This narrow pa&s;|&s;age, through which one of the&s;e animals only can pa&s;s at a time, is covered at top: on this top are placed &s;ome expert hunt&s;men, who drive the elephant to the end of the pa&s;&s;age with a &s;tick, to the top of which is fa&s;tened a &s;harp-pointed hook. As &s;oon as they have got him here, they take away the beams which clo&s;e the end of the pa&s;&s;age, and leave the opening free.

When one of the&s;e bea&s;ts has thus been led out of the korahl, the others follow more willingly, being all in hopes of obtaining their liberty, as they have &s;een nothing to make them &s;u&s;pect the fate of the fir&s;t that went out. When the hunt is quite fini&s;hed, and all the elephants are &s;een fa&s;t bound to trees. In that manner they are to &s;tand &s;everal days, being all the while kept low in point of food, in order that they may know that they are not now their own ma&s;ters, but &s;ubject to the will of others. Attendants are placed by the &s;ide of each animal, who give him his food by little and little, to the end that he may learn to di&s;tingui&s;h, and grow acquainted with mankind. At fir&s;t he looks very &s;our on an attendant of this kind; in the cour&s;e of a few days, however, he becomes more re&s;igned to his fate, and allows the former to come near him and handle him. He likewi&s;e &s;oon comes to under&s;tand what his governor &s;ays to him; and even &s;uffers a &s;trong rope to be thrown round his neck, with which
<PB N="127" REF="020444_0129_0FAF0FE96D5FC0D0">
rope he is coupled to a tame elephant, and &s;o led into the &s;table. This is performed in the follow|ing manner. A tame elephant has, on either &s;ide of him a wild one; and, if he is of a great &s;ize, he has even two &s;maller ones on each &s;ide. The kornack &s;its on the tame animal with his &s;harp-pointed hook, with which he turns the creature by the head the way he would have him go, and thus leads his captured elephants to their &s;tables, in which are driven down &s;tout poles, or trunks of trees. To the&s;e they are fa&s;tened by the hind leg, at &s;ome di&s;tance from each other, &s;o that they cannot come together; and thus they are &s;uffered to &s;tand, being fed daily with cocoa-nut leaves, and once a day led to water by the tame ones, till the proper time arrives for taking them to market and &s;elling them. It is ea&s;y to imagine, that this kind of hunting is attended with more trouble, noi&s;e and tumult, than tho&s;e which are &s;et on foot by our princes and great people in Germany, as neither dogs nor fire|arms can be u&s;ed here. But what is mo&s;t to be admired in all this affair is, the great boldne&s;s of the hunt&s;men, who know how to manage this animal, in it&s;elf &s;o terrible, as readily as a &s;kil|ful hunt&s;man in our country manages his hounds. The&s;e kornacks or hunt&s;men, have a trifling pen|&s;ion; but the country fellows that help to drive the elephants together, have only that one day taken off from the number of days on which they
<PB N="128" REF="020444_0130_0FAF0FEA35D1B1D8">
are obliged to labour, as va&s;&s;als, on ordinary &s;er|vices.</P>
<P N="2">II. Another method of taking the&s;e animals, is that which is practi&s;ed (in the countries re|&s;pectively &s;ubject to them) by the orders of the &s;even tributary princes, whom I mentioned in a cur&s;ory manner, when I was treating of the ex|ten&s;ive power of the governor. They have pits, &s;ome fathoms deep, in tho&s;e places whither the elephant is wont to go in &s;earch of food. Acro&s;s the&s;e pits are laid poles, covered with leaves, and in the middle baited with the food of which the elephant is fonde&s;t. As &s;oon as he &s;ets eyes on this, he makes directly towards it, and on a &s;udden finds him&s;elf taken unawares. His new &s;ituation at fir&s;t &s;ets him almo&s;t mad; at length however he becomes cooler, and bethinks him|&s;elf what he &s;hall do in the&s;e di&s;agreeable cir|cum&s;tances. Accordingly, having fir&s;t thrown from him the materials of his &s;nare, which had fallen in with him, he makes &s;ome endeavours at getting out; but finding him&s;elf too heavy to accompli&s;h this, he cries out for &s;ome of his own &s;pecies, to come to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance. At length he &s;ees &s;ome of them coming towards him, and flatters him&s;elf that they are come to help him out. This, in fact, they do; but being of the tame, dome&s;ticated kind, as &s;oon as they have pulled him out by means of ropes, they make him pri&s;oner, and deliver him up into the hands of their leader. If he appears di&s;contented at this
<PB N="129" REF="020444_0131_0FAF0FEA73F740D0">
treatment, and endeavours to regain his liberty, he gets well thra&s;hed; and is di&s;ciplined in this manner, till he &s;ubmits with a good grace to be fettered and led any where, ju&s;t as his driver plea&s;es. That he may be got out the ea&s;ier, the pit is made rather &s;hallow, and &s;helving on one &s;ide, &s;o that he can in &s;ome mea&s;ure help him|&s;elf out; otherwi&s;e it would not be po&s;&s;ible to draw out &s;uch a large and heavy animal, with|out doing him &s;ome damage.</P>
<P N="3">III. The third and la&s;t &s;pecies of capture, is that practi&s;ed by the Moors (as they are called in tho&s;e parts, from their following the doctrines of the Koran) who by the&s;e means are enabled to pay their rents to the lords of the manor, the Dutch Ea&s;t India Company. It con&s;i&s;ts of the following manoeuvres: in times of drought, when the elephants, being in want of water, are u&s;ed to haunt certain particular &s;pots, where they know they &s;hall find water to quench their thir&s;t; the&s;e people (a &s;trong and hardy race of men) go a hunting in parties, con&s;i&s;ting of four men each, accompanied by &s;ome &s;tout young lads, their children, whom they have brought up to this bu&s;ine&s;s; and in this manner &s;earch the wood through, till they have found a herd of elephants. Having attained this point, they pitch on the large&s;t of the&s;e animals, and keep|ing continually hovering about him, endeavour to get him away from the re&s;t.
