<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHILE I ask your protection for these Essays, I cannot deny having myself some esteem for them. Yet permit me to say, that did I not trust to your candor and sensibility, and hope they will plead for the errors your judgment must discover, I should never have availed my|self of the liberty I have obtained&mdash;that of dedicating these simple effusions to the greatest modern Master of that charming talent, in which I can never be more than a distant copyist.</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE TO THE <HI>FIRST</HI> AND <HI>SECOND</HI> EDITIONS.</HEAD>
<P>THE little Poems, which are here called Sonnets, have, I believe, no very just claim to that title: But they consist of four|teen lines, and appear to me no improper vehicle for a single Sentiment. I am told, and I read it as the opinion of very good judges, that the legitimate Sonnet is illy cal|culated for our language. The specimen Mr. Hayley has given, though they form a strong exception, prove no more, than that the difficulties of the attempt vanish before uncommon powers.</P>
<P>Some very melancholy moments have been beguiled, by expre&s;sing in verse the sensa|tions
<PB N="vi" REF="029523_0005_0FE1BB1BFB3637E8">those moments brought. Some of my friends, with partial indiscretion, have mul|tiplied the copies they procured of several of these attempts, till they found their way into the prints of the day in a mutilated state; which, concurring with other circum|stances, determined me to put them into their present form. I can hope for readers only among the few, who to sensibility of heart, join simplicity of taste.</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE TO THE <HI>THIRD</HI> AND <HI>FOURTH</HI> EDITIONS.</HEAD>
<P>THE reception given by the public, as well as my particular friends, to the two first Editions of these Poems, has induced me to add to the present such other Sonnets as I have written since, or have recovered from my acquaintance, to whom I had given them without thinking well enough of them at the time to preserve any copies myself. A few of those last written, I have attempted on the Italian model; with what succe&s;s I know not, but I am persuaded that to the generality of readers those which are le&s;s regular will be more pleasing.</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE TO THE <HI>SIXTH</HI> EDITION.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN a sixth Edition of these lit|tle Poems was lately called for, it was pro|posed to me, to add such Sonnets or other pieces, as I might have written since the pub|lication of the fifth.&mdash;Of these, however, I had only a few; and on shewing them to a friend of whose judgment I had a high opin|ion, he remarked, that some of them, partic|ularly `The Sleeping Woodman,' and `The Return of the Nightingale,' resembled in their subjects, and still more in the plaintive tone in which they are written, the greater part of those in the former Editions&mdash;and that, per|haps, some of a more lively cast, might be
<PB N="x" REF="029523_0009_0FE1BB202F361710">better liked by the Public.&mdash;`Toujours per|drix,' said my friend, `Toujours perdrix,' you know, `ne vaut rien.'&mdash;I am far from supposing that <HI>your</HI> compositions can be neg|lected or disapproved on whatever subject; but perhaps `toujours Ro&s;signols, toujours des chansons tristes,' may not be so well re|ceived as if you attempted, what you would certainly execute as succe&s;sfully, a more cheerful style of composition.&mdash;`Alas!' re|plied I, `Are grapes gathered from thorns, or figs from thistles?'&mdash;Or, Can the <HI>effect</HI> cease, while the <HI>cause</HI> remains? <HI>You know</HI> that when in the Beech Woods of Hampshire, I first struck the chords of the melancholy lyre, its notes were never intended for the public ear! It was unaffected sorrows drew them forth: I wrote mournfully because I was un|happy: And I have unfortunately no reason
<PB N="xi" REF="029523_0010_0FE1D22E6D228CD8">yet, though nine years have since elapsed, to <HI>change my tone.</HI> The time is indeed arrived, when I have been promised by `<HI>the Honorable Men</HI>' who <HI>nine years ago,</HI> undertook to see that my family obtained the provision their grand|father designed for them, that `all should be well&mdash;all should be settled.' But still I am condemned to feel the `<HI>hope delayed that mak|eth the heart sick.</HI>' Still to receive&mdash;not a rep|etition of promises indeed&mdash;<HI>but of scorn and insult</HI>; when I apply to those gentlemen, they will neither tell me <HI>when</HI> they will proceed to divide the estate; or, <HI>whether they will ever do so at all.</HI> You know the circumstances under which I have now so long been laboring; and you have done me the honor to say, that few women could so long have contended with them. With these, however, as they are some of them of a domestic and painful nature, I will
<PB N="xii" REF="029523_0011_0FE1D1F945FFFED8">not trouble the public <HI>now</HI>; but while they exist in all their force, that indulgent public must accept all I am able to atchieve&mdash;`Tou|jours des chansons tristes!'</P>
<P>Thus ended the short dialogue between my friend and me, and I repeat it as an apology for that apparent despondence, which when it is observed for a long series of years, may look like affectation. <HI>I shall be sorry,</HI> if on some future occasion, I should feel myself compelled to detail its causes more at length; for notwithstanding I am thus frequently ap|pearing as an authore&s;s, and have derived from thence many of the greatest advantages of my life, (since it has procured me friends whose attachment is most invaluable) I am well aware that for a woman&mdash;`The post of honor is a private station.'</P>

<P>THE Editor of this (Worcester) Edition, intend|ed to have published it nearly four years since, at which time he had the plates engraved in his Office in this town. His being employed in printing larger and heavier volumes has prevented these Sonnets appearing from his Pre&s;s till now.&mdash;As the Letter Pre&s;s has been delayed, he could have wished the Engravings had been also; as in the infancy of engraving in this country, four years' additional experience to the artist would doubtle&s;s have produced more delicate work than what is now presented. The lovers of this Art will, however, be enabled, in some measure, to mark the progre&s;s of Engraving by a comparison of the Plates <HI>now</HI> ex|ecuted with these, and the Editor doubts not but a proper allowance will be made for work engraved by an artist who obtained his knowledge in this country, by whom these plates were executed, and that done by European engrav|ers who have settled in the United States.</P>
<P>The making of the particular kind of paper on which these Sonnets are printed, is a new busine&s;s in America; and but lately introduced into Greatbritain; it is the first manufactured by the Editor.</P>
<P>On the whole, the Editor hopes for the candor of those who wish well to the productions of the Columbian Pre&s;s&mdash; their favorable acceptance of this, and other volumes print|ed in this country, will doubtle&s;s raise an emulation to produce others, better executed, on superior paper, and with more delicate engravings.</P>

<HEAD>ELEGY.</HEAD>
<P>This elegy is written on the supposition that an indigent young woman had been addre&s;sed by the son of a wealthy yeoman, who resenting his attach|ment, had driven him from home, and compelled him to have recourse for subsistence to the occupa|tion of a pilot, in which, attempting to save a ves|sel in distre&s;s, he perished.</P>
<P>The father dying, a tomb is supposed to be erected to his memory in the churchyard men|tioned in Sonnet the 44th. And while a tem|pest is gathering, the unfortunate young woman

<HEAD>THE ORIGIN OF FLATTERY.</HEAD>
<P>This little poem was written almost extempore on occasion of a conversation where many pleasant things were said on the subject of flattery; and some French gentlemen who were of the party, inquired for a synonime in English to the French word fleurette. The poem was inserted in the two first editions, and having been asked for by
<PB N="126" REF="029523_0128_0FE1D2F76AEC8A68">very respectable subscribers to the present, it is re|printed. The sonnets have been thought too gloomy, and the author has been advised to insert some of a more cheerful cast. This poem may by others be thought too gay, and is indeed so little in unison with the present sentiments and feelings of its author, that it had been wholly omitted but for the respectable approbation of those to whose judgment she owed implicit deference.</P>
