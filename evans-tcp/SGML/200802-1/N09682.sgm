<P>THE power of prejudice over the minds of mankind is very extraor|dinary; hardly any extreams too di&s;tant, or ab&s;urdities too glaring for it to unite or reconcile, if it tends to promote or ju&s;|tify a favourite pur&s;uit. It is thus we are to account for the fallacious rea&s;onings and ab&s;urd &s;entiments u&s;ed and entertained concerning negroes, and the lawfulne&s;s of keeping them &s;laves. The low contempt with which they are generally treated by the whites, lead children from the fir&s;t dawn of rea&s;on, to con&s;ider people with a black &s;kin, on a footing with dome&s;tic animals, form'd to &s;erve and obey, whom they may kick, beat, and treat as they plea&s;e, without their having any right to complain; and when they attain the age of maturity, can &s;carce be brought to be|lieve that creatures they have always look|ed upon &s;o va&s;tly below them&s;elves, can &s;tand on the &s;ame footing in the &s;ight of the Univer&s;al Father, or that ju&s;tice re|quires the &s;ame conduct to them as to whites; and tho&s;e prejudices having been

I therefore reque&s;t all &s;uch into who&s;e hands this may fall, to dive&s;t them&s;elves of every bias ari&s;ing either from prejudice, or temporal views, and coolly weigh the following hints, and, if any thing is met with, that tends to promote chri&s;tian rectitude, embrace it; without regarding the hand from whence it comes, ever bear|ing in mind who it was that declared,&mdash;<Q>Such mea&s;ure as you mete, &s;hall be mea|&s;ured to you again.</Q> <HI>Mat.</HI> vii.2.</P>

<P>MY mind having been frequently led to con&s;ider the incon&s;i&s;tency of the practice of &s;lave-keeping, and making traffic of our fellow-men, to the precepts and doctrine of our ble&s;&s;ed Lord and Lawgiver, which, with regard to duty one to another, is &s;um'd up in this &s;hort command, viz. <Q>What&s;oever ye would that men &s;hould do to you, do ye even &s;o to them,</Q> and wi&s;hing to &s;ee an end put to this unrighte|ous practice among chri&s;tians, felt an incli|nation to fling a few hints together, &s;everal of which to me appeared new on the &s;ub|ject, which may po&s;&s;ibly lead &s;ome more clo&s;ely to in&s;pect their own &s;ituation, in or|der to di&s;cover how far they &s;tand ap|proved by impartial ju&s;tice in this bu&s;ine&s;s, and as the Jewi&s;h law was po&s;itive, <Q>That
<PB N="6" REF="012323_0005_0F8A3A030AA92040">
whoever &s;tealeth a man and &s;elleth him, or if he be found in his hand, he &s;hall &s;urely be put to death.</Q> Exod. xxi.I6.</P>
<P>The following <HI>Queries</HI> may be worthy our &s;erious attention.</P>
<P N="1"><HI>Query</HI> I. Was this part of the ceremonial law intended only for the Jewi&s;h nation, or founded on univer&s;al di&s;tributive ju&s;tice, adapted to the nature of things, and equally nece&s;&s;ary to the re&s;t of mankind?</P>
<P N="2">II. Is he who encourages the thief to &s;teal and receives the goods, more innocent than the thief?</P>
<P N="3">III. As chri&s;tians con&s;ider it unlawful to make &s;laves of their fellow-believers, does the precepts of Chri&s;t, or nature of things give a chri&s;tian any &s;tronger title to his na|tive freedom than an African?</P>
<P N="4">IV. If it was a heinous crime to take a fellow-&s;ervant by the throat and deprive him of his liberty becau&s;e he could not pay a ju&s;t debt, is it not much more &s;o to de|prive our fellow-&s;ervants of their freedom who owe us nothing, nor ever did us the lea&s;t injury?</P>
<P N="5">V. Is not the command which prohibits the coveting our neighbour's ox, &s;ervant, &amp;c. broke with a much deeper degree of
<PB N="7" REF="012323_0006_0F8A3A03CA00DA20">
guilt, by coveting his per&s;on, and when in our power the making him our &s;lave?</P>
<P N="6">VI. Does not he, who for gain, buys, &s;ells, or keeps in &s;lavery the de&s;cendants of tho&s;e who were unju&s;tly deprived of their freedom, thereby ju&s;tify the original act, and put him&s;elf in the place of the fir&s;t aggre&s;&s;or?</P>
<P><HI>Object.</HI> But the negroes brought here are captives taken in war, and, by the cu&s;tom of the country belong to the victors, who have a right to &s;lay or otherwi&s;e di&s;po&s;e of them.</P>
<P>To pa&s;s over the Europeans being the oc|ca&s;ion of tho&s;e wars by their demand for &s;laves, and that many of the negroes brought here, have been &s;tole, &amp;c. let us con&s;ider how far a cu&s;tom allowed of among benighted Africans, is to be countenanced and upheld by enlightened chri&s;tians, who are commanded to, <Q>Do unto others, as they would have others do unto them,</Q> not to a part only, to tho&s;e of their own re|ligion or colour, but to all men; where|fore no chri&s;tian can keep a &s;lave or be ac|ce&s;&s;ary thereto, without (in &s;ome degree) incurring the guilt of breaking his Lord's command, unle&s;s he is willing him&s;elf and po&s;terity &s;hould be &s;laves; and as to this cu&s;tom of &s;elling tho&s;e of their own nation and colour into perpetual &s;lavery, from pa|rents, hu&s;bands, wives, children, and all

the tender connections of life; who can think of it without the utmo&s;t abhorrence. Shall we then, &s;hall chri&s;tians plead it as an excu&s;e for our conduct, when at the &s;ame time we are the moving cau&s;e which pro|duce tho&s;e effects, as certaintly as the weights in a clock are the cau&s;e of its &s;triking. Re|move the weights and the &s;triking cea&s;es. Let all who bear the chri&s;tian name leave buying &s;laves, and this infernal cu&s;tom of theirs, of &s;elling their brethren will I be|lieve equally cea&s;e. A cu&s;tom that ca&s;ts the mo&s;t indelible odium on the whole peo|ple, occa&s;ioning &s;ome from hence to infer that they are a different race, formed by the Creator for brutal &s;ervices, to drudge for us with their brethren of the &s;talls.&mdash;However extravagant &s;uch a &s;uppo&s;ition may appear, it is the only rational one that can fully ju&s;tify the practice, and give peace of mind to a &s;lave keeper; for until he can per&s;uade him&s;elf that this is the ca&s;e, the above precept mu&s;t continually reproach him with being a hypocrite and no chri&s;tian who can thus live in a deliberate oppo&s;iti|on to Chri&s;t's command; and I am fully per&s;uaded there is few to be found who ju&s;tifies the practice but is more or le&s;s tinctured with this opinion. Well then if this people's cu&s;tom of going to war for no other purpo&s;e than to take pri&s;oners;

&s;tealing, kidnapping, &amp;c. their neighbours and children, in order to &s;ell them for &s;laves, cannot be thought of without rai&s;ing the utmo&s;t dete&s;tation, as what mo&s;t effectu|ally &s;aps and de&s;troys every &s;ocial tie, on which all temporal happine&s;s &s;tands &mdash; is black with every guilt, and the mo&s;t truly infernal of any practice that ever obtained among mankind &mdash; what excu&s;e, what plea, will our negroe ma&s;ters make at the great day of retribution, for encouraging tho&s;e execrable crimes by receiving the plunder?&mdash;It will be none, I doubt, to &s;ay my negro was born in my father's hou&s;e, or in America, and therefore not obtained in that way; for I con&s;ider the per&s;on who was brought from his native country again&s;t his will and made a &s;lave, to exi&s;t in each in|dividual of his po&s;terity, however di&s;tant in point of time. And the per&s;on in who&s;e hand &s;uch po&s;terity is found, &s;o long as the injury is continued, to repre&s;ent the original &s;tealer or plunderer, who&s;e right hath been conveyed down to him, and is that by which he claims property in &s;uch po&s;terity, con|&s;equently repre&s;ents him in whom this claim ultimately exi&s;ted; nor can he wa&s;h his hands from this guilt by delivering &s;uch pretended property either by &s;ale or gift to another, more than Pilot wa&s;hed his from the guilt of Chri&s;t's death, whom he

<P>But to return to the &s;ource of this evil; if we look upon the fir&s;t move &s;o odious, &s;o hateful, and find our&s;elves filled with indignation and abhorrence again&s;t the per|petrators, how can we countenance and encourage, and thereby become promoters, abettors, and acce&s;&s;ories therein, which every one in a le&s;s or greater degree is who buys, &s;ells, or keeps in &s;lavery one of the&s;e people after the age the law of nature gives each human being an equal right to freedom; for can there be a greater ab&s;ur|dity than to &s;ay, I dete&s;t the plunderer, when I am greedily &s;haring the &s;poils; or innocent of the guilt, if I refu&s;e to make re&s;titution to the true owner of his proper|ty of which I am in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and of which he was unju&s;tly deprived.&mdash;This opens a large field for con&s;ideration, for it really appears to me impo&s;&s;ible for any one of their own &s;eeking and choice, to be con|cerned in &s;lave-keeping, or partake of the profits, without incurring a degree of the original guilt. For if an innocent free-man, who had no ways forfeited his freedom, was by force taken from his native country and made a &s;lave and begets children, who by virtue of the original injury are kept &s;laves, and they beget others, and &s;o on for twenty

Children are not to an&s;wer for the &s;ins of their parents; and whoever having the care or po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a child, and denies him his freedom at an age the laws of his coun|try gives it to others, and without any act or con&s;ent of the party to ju&s;tify it, com|mits an act of violence again&s;t the &s;tronge&s;t of laws, the law of nature,&mdash;robs that individial of his inherent property, his freedom, a right which was never given by the univer&s;al Father to any one of his crea|tures over one another, without &s;ome fault on their part, not even to parents over their children. &mdash; A property more &s;acred, inte|re&s;ting,

<P>HAVING in the foregoing tract &s;e|veral times mentioned the law of na|ture; &s;ome may a&s;k what is the Law of na|ture.
