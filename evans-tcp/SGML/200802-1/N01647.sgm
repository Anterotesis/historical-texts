pre&s;ervation of Peace and Quietne&s;s among men: for which all Chri&s;tians ought to Pray earne&s;tly unto God; which is the Duty the Apo&s;tle exhorts to in our Text.</P>
<P>The Exhortation is, 1. <HI>General,</HI> Expre&s;s'd in the preceding Ver&s;e; <HI>I exhort therefore, that fir&s;t of all, Supplications, Prayers, Interce&s;&s;ions, &amp; giving of Thanks be made for all men:</HI> Prayer is the Duty here Exhorted to; and I con|ceive the Variety of Phra&s;es by which the Apo&s;tle expre&s;&s;es it, is not Needle&s;s or Su|perfluous, but that it has its Significancy, and intimates to us at lea&s;t the Nece&s;&s;ity and Importance of the Duty; and the Fervency wherewith it is to be performed: The A|po&s;tle adds giving of Thanks, which though it be not E&s;&s;ential to Prayer, yet by Divine Order it is to be in&s;erted into all our Prayers: <HI>Phil.</HI> 4. 6. <HI>But in every thing by Prayer and Sup|plication with Thank&s;giving, let your Reque&s;ts be made known unto God:</HI> And indeed it is high|ly Rea&s;onable &s;eeing God continually Ad|mini&s;ters to us Matter and Occa&s;ions of Thank&s;giving; and as we ought to Pray for Mercy for all Men, which is the fir&s;t Branch of the Exhortation (except it be for &s;uch as are Guilty of the Sin, for which the Apo&s;tle would not &s;ay that Chri&s;tians ought to Pray, which Exception is to be under&s;tood in the Apo&s;tles Exhortation) &s;o we ought in our
<PB N="3" REF="001955_0004_0FBA419541AD90C0">
Prayers for them to offer Thank&s;giving to God on their behalf, for the Bounties and Ble&s;&s;ings He is continually be&s;towing upon them.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Particular,</HI> As in the Text; where we may ob&s;erve two things.</P>
<P N="1">(1.) The Per&s;ons we are Exhorted to Pray for, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> <HI>For Kings, &amp; for all in Authority;</HI> or all that are in Eminent Place, as it might have been rendered: Which intends tho&s;e that have Supreme Authority &amp; all that are Commi&s;&s;ionated by them, and Govern under them; thus the Apo&s;tle Phra&s;eth it under another Head, 1<HI>Pet.</HI> 2. 13, 14. <HI>Whether it be to the King, as Supreme; Or unto Governours, as unto tho&s;e that are &s;ent by him.</HI> Which in|tends the Supreme and all Inferiour Ma|gi&s;trates; which in tho&s;e times were Hea|thens, Di&s;countenancers of and Enemies to the Chri&s;tian Religion; neverthele&s;s it was the will of the In&s;pired Apo&s;tle not only that their Authority &s;hould be Subjected to; but al&s;o that they &s;hould be Prayed for in all Chri&s;tian Congregations.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) The rea&s;on of it; <HI>That we may lead a Quiet and Peaceable Life in all Godline&s;s and Hone&s;ty:</HI> There is a Threefold Peace; Peace with God; In our own Con&s;ciences; And with Men or in Societies, It is this latter that is particularly meant in the words; and I
<PB N="4" REF="001955_0005_0FBA4196A21737F8">
take the other Term, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> <HI>Quiet,</HI> to be Syno|nimous and to mean the &s;ame thing: and the&s;e are ab&s;olutely Nece&s;&s;ary to the comfort of Life: for though we have a Confluence of all other good things yet if we have not Peace &amp; Quietne&s;s in the Fruition of them; we &s;hall want much of their Comfort, and their Sweetne&s;s will be very much di|mini&s;hed: the Apo&s;tle adds, <HI>In all Godline&s;s and Hone&s;ty,</HI> which &s;eems to Limit Peace and Quietne&s;s to things Sacred, as to the Wor|&s;hip of God and the Exerci&s;e of Religion which are intended in the&s;e Phra&s;es, 9. <HI>d.</HI> That we may Wor&s;hip God according to the mind of Chri&s;t in the Go&s;pel, and Practice the other Duties of Religion without Mo|le&s;tation, which they often met with from their Heathen Rulers and from the Jews by their allowance; and doubtle&s;s the Apo&s;tle had a particular aim at this and de&s;ired it above all other things: But yet we may &s;up|po&s;e that the general meaning of the Apo&s;tle in this expre&s;&s;ion was, that they might not be Di&s;turbed or Di&s;quieted in any of their Injoyments, and in this Latitude I &s;hall take the words.</P>
<P>The Matter of our Prayers for Kings, and tho&s;e in Authority is not to be Limited by this clau&s;e in the Text, for then we &s;hould Pray for our &s;elves rather than for them, but
<PB N="5" REF="001955_0006_0FBA41988EB5E650">
our Prayers for them ought to be Directed by their Circum&s;tances and Conditions: The Apo&s;tle is &s;ilent as to the Petitions which they were to offer unto God for their Rulers; but we may conclude, that, they being Hea|thens and Enemies to the Chri&s;tian Religion, one main &amp; principal thing which they were to Petition for, was, that they might be Con|verted to the Chri&s;tian Faith, and be made Defenders, Countenancers and Incouragers of their Religion: but we living under a Chri&s;ti|an Government, and being under Chri&s;tian Rulers, our Prayers for them mu&s;t be Varied accordingly: but more may be &s;aid of this afterwards.</P>
<P>The Text is Copious and affords In&s;tructi|ons to all Orders and Degrees of Men.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Civil Rulers</HI> are here In&s;tructed in one great End and De&s;ign of Government, which is the Peace and Quietne&s;s of tho&s;e over whom they Rule, and al&s;o in their Work and Duty; which is the Procurement &amp; Mainte|nance of their Peace &amp; Quietne&s;s, that they may lead a Peaceable and Quiet Life under their Government, this is Plainly Sugge&s;ted in the Text.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The Ruled</HI> are here In&s;tructed in their Duty, particularly and expre&s;ly in the great Duty of Prayer to God for their Rulers, that they may be furni&s;hed to their Work, and be
<PB N="6" REF="001955_0007_0FBA419A2C559818">
made In&s;trumental in bringing about this great end &amp; de&s;ign of Government the Peace &amp; Quietne&s;s of tho&s;e over whom they Rule: The&s;e are the two Heads which by Divine A&s;&s;i&s;tance, I &s;hall &s;peak to at this Time.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Peace and Quietne&s;s among Men and in Societies, is one end and de&s;ign of Civil Government, and it is the Work and Duty of all that are In|ve&s;ted with Civil Power and Authority to en|deavour that all that Live under their Government may have Peace and Quietne&s;s in all their Injoy|ments.</HI> This is &s;o Plain and Evident that I need not inlarge upon the Proof of it: two things are included in it.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Peace and Quietne&s;s among Men and in Societies is one end and de&s;ign of Government:</HI> And one of the Principal ends and de&s;igns of it next unto the Glory of God, which is the ultimate End and De&s;ign of all things. The Supreme Lord hath Ordained Govern|ment and given Kings and Rulers their Of|fices and their Dignity for this end; that they being Armed with Power and Authori|ty they may Pre&s;erve Publick Peace and Or|der in the World: and herein it is that they are Mini&s;ters of God for our good.</P>
<P>For the Proof of this I &s;hall only In&s;tance in &s;ome of the main parts of Government, and &s;hew that this is their Principal de&s;ign,
<PB N="7" REF="001955_0008_0FBA419C372318D8">
which will &s;ufficiently Evince that it is one main end and de&s;ign of the whole.</P>
<P N="1">(1.) This is the de&s;ign of all Humane Laws which contain the Rules of Government, and it ought to be in the Intention of tho&s;e that have the Power of making them, and al&s;o of them that are appointed for the Execution of them; they are for the Protection of the Subjects in a Quiet and Peaceable Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all that God and Nature hath Be&s;towed upon them; and they ought to be framed accordingly and &s;o Executed: That this end may be attained; that every man may &s;it Quietly under his Vine &amp; be undi&s;turbed in their Injoyments of what kind &s;o ever they be.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) This is the end and de&s;ign of all Ad|mini&s;trations of Ju&s;tice in Civil Courts: they are appointed for the Deci&s;ion of Controver|&s;ies among Men: The true Ground or Foundation of Differences and Contentions among Men: or Wrong done either real or &s;uppo&s;ed and imaginary: now Civil Courts are appointed to Inquire into all Wrongs and Injuries, and to give Judgment according as they appear, which is to Determine and I&s;&s;ue the Controver&s;ies that ari&s;e there from: So that Peace and Quietne&s;s is the end and de|&s;ign of the Admini&s;tration of Ju&s;tice in Civil Courts.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="8" REF="001955_0009_0FBA419E206234F8">
(3.) This is the De&s;ign and Intention of many of the Offices that are Conferred in Government; which may be Termed Offices or Commi&s;&s;ions of the Peace: which Offices do particularly oblige tho&s;e that &s;u&s;tain them to take care of the Peace &amp; to Improve their Power and Authority, for the Defence and Pre&s;ervation of it: and unto &s;uch, Per&s;ons are Directed to go for Relief when Unju&s;tly Mole&s;ted and Injured: the&s;e things Argue that this is one of the main ends and de&s;igns of Government. And we are not to think this too <HI>mean</HI> to be the de&s;ign of &s;o Honoura|ble a Calling and Imployment: for Peace and Quietne&s;s or Undi&s;turbed Injoyment of our Ble&s;&s;ings whether Spiritual or Temporal, is the very Life of our Injoyments, and the want of it renders every thing Uncomfortable and Unplea&s;ant: it is more Eligible to want many other Ble&s;&s;ings than that of Peace and Quietne&s;s: <HI>Prov.</HI> 17. 1. <HI>Better is a dry Mor&s;el, and Quietne&s;s therewith, than a Hou&s;e full of Sa|crifices with Strife.</HI></P>
<P>But I Proceed:</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>It is therefore the Work and Duty of all that are Inve&s;ted with Civil Power &amp; Authority to en|deavour after the Attainment of this good and great end of Government:</HI> And all that are Im|ployed in Government, ought to make &s;uch an Improvement of their Authority in their
<PB N="9" REF="001955_0010_0FBA419F4BF829C8">
re&s;pective Po&s;ts, as that tho&s;e that are under their Government may lead a Quiet and a Peaceable Life: this nece&s;&s;arily follows, for &s;urely if this be one end of Government, then tho&s;e that are Imployed in Government ought to look at this and to endeavour after it: But this is evident to all and I need not offer any further Proof of it. I proceed to
The APPLICATION of this Head.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Hence what&s;oever in any Government whe|ther it be Per&s;on, Office or Law, or any other thing, that cro&s;&s;es &amp; ob&s;tructs this de&s;ign of Government, it is &amp; mu&s;t be accounted an Evil, and ought to be Suppre&s;&s;ed.</HI> The Law accounts them &s;uch, &s;tyling them common Nu&s;ances; and &s;uch there are in every Government; and doubt|le&s;s were Strict Inqui&s;ition made, there might be many &s;uch things found in this Go|vernment, which have hither unto Ob&s;truct|ed our Peace and Quietne&s;s, and Fru&s;trated the Attempts that have been made for the Procurement thereof: and &s;o long as &s;uch things are allowed and connived at Peace can't be expected.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Hence Peaceable men, being otherways Qualified, are the mo&s;t fit for Office in Go|vernment.</HI> Men of Peaceable and Quiet Tempers and Spirits; Men that are Zealous
<PB N="10" REF="001955_0011_0FBA41A0AD58BFD8">
for Peace; &amp; are willing to forego their own Intere&s;t, for the Peace and Tranquility of the whole: the&s;e are the men fit for Offices in Government; for the&s;e are the mo&s;t likely to attain this end of Government and to Procure and Maintain the Peace and Quiet|ne&s;s of the People: and this may &s;erve for a Direction unto tho&s;e who have the Privilege of de&s;igning Per&s;ons for Offices, and have Power of Conferring Offices upon Per&s;ons in this Government; this ought to be Re|garded e&s;pecially at this time, when Divi|&s;ions and Animo&s;ities abound in the Govern|ment.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>And La&s;tly,</HI> I &s;hall Conclude with a word of <HI>Exhortation</HI> unto tho&s;e that are or are to be our Rulers for the En&s;uing Year; <HI>There are many things which Di&s;turb our Peace; and becau&s;e of our Divi&s;ions there are great thoughts of Heart.</HI> It is fitting, <HI>Honourable, Wor&s;hipful, and Highly E&s;teemed,</HI> that under this Head I &s;hould make my Humble Addre&s;s unto you particularly, for the Healing of our Dif|ferences and the Recovery of our Peace and Quietne&s;s: The Addre&s;s has been already made by a better Hand upon the la&s;t occa&s;i|on of this Nature: but in as much as our Di|vi&s;ions and Animo&s;ities &s;till remain, and I fear Increa&s;e. I mu&s;t beg leave to Re-a&s;&s;ume the Exhortation; and in Meekne&s;s and with
<PB N="11" REF="001955_0012_0FBA41A260F97B88">
all due Re&s;pect I Intreat that you &s;till u&s;e your utmo&s;t endeavours that our <HI>Jeru&s;alem may be Built a City Compact,</HI> and that it may be <HI>a Quiet and Peaceable Habitation:</HI> This is pe|culiarly your Province, and our Eyes are upon you under God for it. It is the Expectation of God whom you Repre&s;ent, and Serve; and of the People over whom you Rule; that you exert all your Power, and Improve all your Wi&s;dom and Dexterity, your Policy and Prudence for to Reduce us to good Order; that we may be favoured with the Invaluable Ble&s;&s;ing of Peace and Quietne&s;s in all our Enjoyments Sacred &amp; Civil. Herein you will Act like Him whom you Repre&s;ent, who has &s;tiled Him&s;elf <HI>the God of Peace;</HI> and is &s;o not only as He is the Author of Peace, but al&s;o as He Loves &amp; Delights in it; and as He has be&s;towed His Honourable Name &amp; Character upon you; &s;o it becomes you to An&s;wer it in your Re&s;pective Places and ac|cording to the Talents Committed to your Tru&s;t. And in &s;o doing you will An&s;wer one main end of your Offices, keep a good Con&s;cience, and Inherit the Ble&s;&s;ing our Lord has Intailed upon Peace Makers, mentioned in <HI>Mat.</HI> 5. 9.</P>
<P>As to our Churches and the Exerci&s;e of our Religion; we have rea&s;on to Bow down and to Adore God for the Liberty and Free|dom
<PB N="12" REF="001955_0013_0FBA41A717D24C10">
the Peace &amp; Quietne&s;s we are Indulged with, and in that our Rulers are Chri&s;tians; Countenancers and Incouragers of Religion; and have made good Laws for the Pre&s;ervati|on of our Peace in the Wor&s;hip of God; and in that the ways to our Solemn A&s;&s;emblies don't Mourn: But yet we have rea&s;on to be Humbled that there has been &s;o many Di|vi&s;ions in &s;ome of our Churches to the great Detriment of Religion and Hindrance to the Work of God in them; and if there might be &s;omething farther done for the Prevent|ing of Feuds and Schi&s;ms in our Churches, it would be very Acceptable unto God and Serviceable to the Intere&s;t of Chri&s;t. I &s;hall not undertake to Determine the Extent of the Civil Magi&s;trates Power in Matters Ec|cle&s;ia&s;tical: it is Evident that there is a care Incumbent upon Civil Rulers of Churches and of Church Matters, and in many Ca&s;es they ought to Exert their Authority: <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">. e.</HI> particularly in matters of Order where there are no particular Rules in the Word of God to Oblige the Con&s;ciences of Men to the con|trary; and in things that are left to the Judgment, Prudence and Conduct of Church Officers and Churches. I conceive that the Rules drawn up and agreed upon by them, whether they be for the more Regular and Decent Wor&s;hipping of God or the Exerci&s;e
<PB N="13" REF="001955_0014_0FBA41AA9A596068">
of Di&s;cipline, ought to be E&s;tabli&s;hed by the Civil Magi&s;trates Authority, and their Sanction ought to be Binding to all; for in &s;uch things all ought to Acquie&s;ce in the Judgment of the Churches; and tho&s;e who Refu&s;e ought to be Compelled, which would very much Conduce to Peace and Quietne&s;s in our Churches; which would very much Advantage Religion in them.</P>
<P>But as to our Civil Affairs; I Pre&s;ume that if Property was &s;etled upon a better Founda|tion, it would Contribute much to our Peace and Quietne&s;s: for many of our Differences, e&s;pecially in our <HI>New Towns,</HI> ari&s;e from the Various Sentiments, and Different Opinions there are about it: and it Creates many Uncomfortable Law-Suits, which Excites the Pa&s;&s;ions of men, begets Prejudices in them, and Ingenders Striles and Conten|tions, which brings with them <HI>Confu&s;ion and every Evil Work.</HI> Hereby our Peace is very much Di&s;turbed and Religion is very much Hurt.</P>
<P>I &s;peak Feelingly, for Divine Providence has ca&s;t my Habitation in the very mid&s;t of them; not that I am Per&s;onally Injured or Mole&s;ted; but my meaning is, that I Feel the Hurt that our Contentions does Religi|on and the Intere&s;t of Men: and I &s;hould exceedingly Rejoyce could there <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e found a
<PB N="14" REF="001955_0015_0FBA41AC1B57F060">
Remedy to prevent tho&s;e intolerable Mole&s;|tations which &s;ome men meet with, and the Litigious and Vexatious Law Suits that are Commenced and Carried on to the great Di&s;turbance of our Peace.</P>
<P>And if there might be a Clo&s;er Applicati|on made of the Laws of the Colony to the Troublers of our <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> it might be very Sub|&s;ervient to our Peace and Quietne&s;s: there are <HI>Achans</HI> among us, who by their Tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ions Mole&s;t us, <HI>Provoke God</HI> and bring down His heavy Judgments upon us <HI>to our Trouble and Confu&s;ion:</HI> the&s;e Frequently e&s;cape due Puni&s;hment, whereby they are Embold|ened in their Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions and proceed even to offer Contempt to our Authority and Laws; there are &s;ome of our Laws which in &s;ome Places are but rarely if ever put in Ex|ecution: the end of the Law which is the Peace and Safety of the Subject can't be At|tained unle&s;s it be put in Execution.</P>
<P>And therefore if there might be great care taken in the De&s;ignation of Per&s;ons for the Execution of the Laws of the Government; and if &s;uch Per&s;ons might be found in every Town, and Impowered for this Service, who are Con&s;cientious, Men of Courage, Zeal and Re&s;olution; who are Sen&s;ible of the Solemn Nature and Obligation of an Oath and Fear it; and had rather Hazard all, than Offend

GOD or Wrong their own Con&s;ciences, or be Unfaithful in their Places and Stations: it would with the Ble&s;&s;ing of God Accom|panying their endeavours, exceedingly Con|duce to our Peace and Quietne&s;s.</P>
<P>And if more Care might be taken of our <HI>New Towns,</HI> it might be very Serviceable to them in their Beginning, and prevent their falling into Contentions.</P>
<P>But to draw to a Clo&s;e: Let Ju&s;tice have free Cour&s;e in the Government, and let Schools of Learning be Incouraged and Pro|moted; this is an Excellent means to Culti|vate the rough Tempers of tho&s;e that are growing up, and to inure them to Civility &amp; good Order; which will contribute to our future Peace and Quietne&s;s.</P>
<P>And above all things let Religion be Pro|moted, and endeavour that Godline&s;s may be in the mid&s;t of us in the Power of it, and that your Peoples Hearts may be &s;ea&s;oned with the Fear of God and be E&s;tabli&s;hed with the Peaceable Principles of Religion.</P>
<P>And for this end, Comfort and Incourage the Emba&s;&s;adours of Peace, who are Devoted to this Work; I Hope none of us are wanting in our Places, either to forward this work or to be helpful unto you in your endeavours for the Peace and Welfare of this People; by our Prayers, Coun&s;els and In&s;tructions;

putting the People in mind to be Subject &amp; Obedient to your Laws &amp; Ordinances.</P>
<P>And finally, Let me commend to you U|nion among your &s;elves, as that which will exceedingly &s;trengthen your Authority, and forward your endeavours &amp; attempts for the attaining of our Peace and Quietne&s;s. En|deavour then to be of one Mind, and at Peace among your &s;elves. I pa&s;s on to</P>
<P>II. <HI>It is the Duty of Chri&s;tians to Pray for tho&s;e that have the Rule over them, that they may be Enabled &s;o to manage Government, as that Publick Peace and Quietne&s;s may be Pre&s;erved.</HI> And under this Head, I &s;hall 1. Shew that it is a Duty: And 2. What we are to Pray for in order hereunto.</P>
<P N="1">1. We may Argue this Duty from &s;undry Heads, As,</P>
<P N="1">(1.) From the <HI>Divine Original of Civil Go|vernment.</HI> It is not an Ordinance of Man, but of God's. <HI>The Powers that be, are of God; who&s;oever therefore re&s;i&s;teth</HI> them, <HI>re&s;i&s;teth</HI> an <HI>Ordinance of God, Rom.</HI> 13. 1, 2. The Original of Government is in God; particular Forms or Modes of Government are of Mans In|venting; but the Sub&s;tance of it came from God, and therefore it Depends upon Him for Support and Succe&s;s: Government can't be Maintained in the World without God who

gave it its being; for the Fir&s;t Cau&s;e of a thing is nece&s;&s;ary to its Sub&s;i&s;tance; neither can there be any good Succe&s;s of Govern|ment, or any of its good Ends attained un|le&s;s its Author Smiles upon it, and His Ble&s;|&s;ing go with it; therefore we ought to Pray to God for tho&s;e that are De&s;igned and Impowred for the Management of Go|vernment.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) From the <HI>Station and Capacity in which Civil Rulers &s;tand in Government.</HI> The High|e&s;t in Authority upon Earth are under God. He is the Supreme, and his Power is Un|limited, and he does what&s;oever he Plea&s;es and gives no Account of his Matters. Men are but In&s;truments in his Hands, and their Offices are only Mini&s;terial; hence called <HI>Mini&s;ters of God, Rom.</HI> 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">. 4. Now In&s;tru|ments depend upon their Efficient Cau&s;e for Power to Act in their Places and in the Work they are Imployed about. Men have no Power to Act in Government but what they Receive from God. <HI>Joh.</HI> 19. 11. <HI>Je&s;us An&s;wered, Thou coulde&s;t have no Power at all again&s;t me, except it were given thee from above.</HI> It is by Influence &amp; Direction and A&s;&s;i&s;tance from above that Kings Reign, <HI>Prov.</HI> 8. 15, 16. <HI>By me Kings Reign, and Princes Decree Ju&s;tice. By me Princes Rule, and Nobles, even all the Judges of the Earth:</HI> They Rule their King|doms
<PB N="18" REF="001955_0019_0FBA41B1E1EE5B08">
wi&s;ely, ju&s;tly &amp; happily, by My Coun|&s;el and A&s;&s;i&s;tance. Therefore we ought to Pray to God for them.</P>
<P N="3">(3) From the <HI>Ab&s;olute Power and Dominion which God has over the hearts of all men.</HI> They are intirely in his Hands; even the hearts of the highe&s;t and greate&s;t upon Earth are at his Command; <HI>Prov.</HI> 21. 1. <HI>The kings heart is in the hand of the Lord, as the rivers of water: He turneth it whither&s;oever he will.</HI> He in|fluences and over-rules the very Inward Pur|po&s;es, Inclinations and Coun&s;els of their Hearts, which &s;eem to be mo&s;t in their own Power and out of the way of all others: God can give unto Rulers the Spirit of Govern|ment, as he gave unto <HI>Saul</HI> another Heart, a Spirit of &amp; Qualification for Government, when He De&s;igned and Appointed him for to Rule his People <HI>I&s;rael;</HI> 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 10. 9. Therefore God is to be &s;ought to for tho&s;e that Rule over us.</P>
<P N="4">(4) From the <HI>Nece&s;&s;ity of Government, and of Per&s;ons very well Accompli&s;hed for to manage it.</HI> Were it not for Government, the World would &s;oon run into all manner of di&s;orders and confu&s;ions: mens Lives and E&s;tates and Liberties would &s;oon be a prey to the Co|vetous and the Cruel; and we can't expre&s;s the Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ice and Murder, the Rapine and Rob|beries, the Mi&s;chiefs and Mi&s;eries which
<PB N="19" REF="001955_0020_0FBA41B35663CBD8">
would abound in the World were there no Government to Re&s;train men: One man would be Bread for another, and the World which is like the Sea for Storms &amp; Tempe&s;ts, would al&s;o Re&s;emble it in this, that the In|habitants thereof would be as the Fi&s;hes of the Sea, the great would Devour the &s;mall; <HI>Hab.</HI> 1. 14. <HI>As the Fi&s;hes of the Sea, who have no Rule over them.</HI> We may plainly &s;ee the Nece&s;&s;ity of Government in the World, in the In&s;tance of &s;ome, who have thrown off the Reins of Government; &amp; what Uprores have they made? What Outrages and Depre|dations have they Committed? taking away the Lives and E&s;tates of men at their Plea|&s;ure: and merely for the gratification of their Cur&s;ed Lu&s;ts; and what the i&s;&s;ue of this tragical de&s;ign will be, God only knows! This is a convincing Argument of the Ne|ce&s;&s;ity of Government. There is al&s;o a Ne|ce&s;&s;ity of well Accompli&s;hed Per&s;ons for the Management of it: The Weight of Govern|ment is too great to be laid upon the Shoul|der of mean men; it is Rulers of the Earth, that under God, uphold it: They are there|fore called, <HI>the Pillars of the Earth, P&s;al.</HI> 73. 3. This argues, that it is a Duty to Pray for <HI>Civil Rulers.</HI></P>
<P N="5">(5) From the <HI>Difficulties which Attend Go|vernment,</HI> which ari&s;e principally from the
<PB N="20" REF="001955_0021_0FBA41B4D4E73DF8">
re&s;tle&s;s Pa&s;&s;ions and ungoverned Spirits and Lu&s;ts of men: The&s;e are the prime occa&s;ion of all tho&s;e Divi&s;ions and Clamours that are in the world; <HI>Jam.</HI> 4. 1: <HI>From whence come Wars and Fightings? Come they not hence, even of your Lu&s;ts, that War in your Members?</HI> This renders the Work of tho&s;e in Government very Difficult; yea Impo&s;&s;ible for them of them&s;elves to Quiet and Still the Tumults that are in the world: and to Suppre&s;s the Di&s;orders that Sin and the Lu&s;ts of men bring into the world. Hence it is in Scrip|ture A&s;cribed to Him that has Power to Command the raging Sea and to &s;till the noi&s;e of its Waves, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 65. 7. <HI>Which &s;tilleth the noi&s;e of their Waves, and the Tumult of the People.</HI> This argues that we ought to Pray to God for our Rulers.</P>
<P N="2">2. To &s;hew what we are to Pray for; or what is to be the Matter of our Prayers for our Rulers. This I &s;hall di&s;patch in the&s;e following particulars.</P>
<P N="1">(1) <HI>We are to Pray for their Welfare, Spiritu|al and Temporal:</HI> That they may have all &s;aving Grace and everla&s;ting Glory. For their Lives, and all tho&s;e Ble&s;&s;ings which are nece&s;&s;ary to their Comfort &amp; Support; and for their Encouragement, that they may be in a Capacity to undergo and grapple with the Fatigues of Government: and to live
<PB N="21" REF="001955_0022_0FBA41B8B52CFDC8">
an&s;werable to the Dignity of their Place and Station in the world; as they are Di&s;tin|gui&s;hed from &amp; exalted above others by the Honour and Dignity that is Conferred upon them, &s;o they ought to be in their living: and as their work and &s;ervice is arduous and difficult, &s;o they ought to be Supported and Encouraged. Which we are to Pray for.</P>
<P N="2">(2) <HI>We are to Pray for all good Qualifications for Government;</HI> as a right Heart and Spirit to rule over others, Knowlege and Wi&s;|dom, Courage and Fortitude, Patience and the Fear of God, a &s;incere &amp; di&s;intere&s;ted aim at the Glory of God, &amp; the Peace, &amp; Order, and Beauty of the world: Strength &amp; Zeal, and Re&s;olution for the vigorous Pro&s;ecution of the&s;e ends: The&s;e are the gifts of God, &amp; are ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for Government: We are therefore to look to God for them: &amp; particularly &amp; e&s;pecially the Prayer which <HI>Solomon</HI> offered unto God for him&s;elf, 1 <HI>King.</HI> 3. 9. is very &s;uitable for us to offer unto God for our Rulers, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> <HI>That God would give them an under&s;tanding Heart, to Judge his People, that they may di&s;cern between good and evil.</HI> And al&s;o that Prayer which he offered unto God, in 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 1. 10. <HI>Give me now Wi&s;dom and Knowlege, that I may go out and come in before this People.</HI></P>
<P N="3"><PB N="22" REF="001955_0023_0FBA41BD4AC500F8">
(3) <HI>For the Pre&s;ence of God with them, the influences of his Spirit &amp; Grace to a&s;&s;i&s;t and di|rect them, and his Ble&s;&s;ing upon their Coun&s;els, De&s;igns and Undertakings, for the attainment of our Peace, that it may flow in as a River.</HI></P>
<P>APPLICATION.</P>
<P N="1">1. Two &s;orts of Per&s;ons are to be Re|proved.</P>
<P N="1">(1) <HI>Tho&s;e who in&s;tead of Praying for Civil Rulers, Revile 'em &amp; &s;peak Contumeliou&s;ly of them.</HI> This mu&s;t needs be a very great evil, becau&s;e it is directly contrary to Praying for them: which the Apo&s;tle in our Text exhorts to, &amp; we have &s;hewed is a Chri&s;tian duty: Which we find al&s;o &s;trictly forbidden, in <HI>Exod.</HI> 22. 28. <HI>Thou &s;halt not revile the gods, nor cur&s;e the ruler of thy people.</HI> Not gods fal&s;ly &s;o called, as &s;ome wou'd have it, but Magi&s;trates &amp; Governours, as is evident in the next clau&s;e, <HI>Nor Cur&s;e the Ruler of thy People.</HI> They are called gods, in <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 82. 6. <HI>I have &s;aid, Ye are gods,</HI>&mdash;It mu&s;t needs therefore be a very great Sin to Revile them, &amp; to &s;peak Evil of them, &amp; an affront unto God who&s;e Deputies they are, under whom they Govern, and who&s;e Name they bear, which renders it odious &amp; abominable. Hence the Apo&s;tle <HI>Jude</HI> animadverts upon it as &s;uch, and that very &s;harply; calling them
<PB N="23" REF="001955_0024_0FBA41C1E43B5078">
<HI>filthy Dreamers</HI> who <HI>de&s;pi&s;e Dominion, and &s;peak evil of Dignities.</HI> And though <HI>Michael the Arch-Angel, when contending with the Devil, dur&s;t not bring a railing accu&s;ation again&s;t him, Jude</HI> 8, 9. Yet how many are there in the&s;e days who are hardy and impudent enough, to heap Reproaches and Contume|lies on their Rulers, who utter their Reviling and &s;currilous Speeches, more freely than they do their Prayers for their Rulers; and if they make any Prayers for them, their Practices contradict them, and render them ineffectual.</P>
<P N="2">(2) <HI>Tho&s;e who hinder our Peace and Quietne&s;s, and promote Contentions, are al&s;o Reprehen&s;ible:</HI> For they act contrary to the duty we have been in&s;i&s;ting on: and contradict the rea&s;on of the Apo&s;tles exhortation in our Text. It is the work of our Rulers to pre&s;erve Peace, and our Duty in the mean time to Pray for them, that they may be A&s;&s;i&s;ted &amp; Directed, Coun&s;elled and Advi&s;ed in this work from above. They that ob&s;truct our Peace act directly contrary not only to their work, but to their own Duty; which mu&s;t needs be a very great evil and very Offen&s;ive unto God. This is one of the <HI>Six things which the Lord hates,</HI> yea it is <HI>the Seventh which is an Abomina|tion to him, Prov.</HI> 6. 19.&mdash;<HI>And him that &s;ow|eth Di&s;cord among Brethren</HI></P>
<P N="2"><PB N="24" REF="001955_0025_0FBA41C3319121F8">
2. From hence we may al&s;o Infer, <HI>the Duties of Reverence, Subjection and Obedience which we owe to our Civil Rulers.</HI> For if we ought to Pray for them, then &s;urely we ought to &s;hew them the Re&s;pect and Reve|rence which the Word of God requires and their Station calls for: and al&s;o to Subject our&s;elves to their Authority, and Obey all their lawful Commands. We are al&s;o here taught that it is our Duty to afford them all that Encouragement, and all that Help we can in their Work: and particularly we ought in our re&s;pective places to concur with and to forward their de&s;igns and en|deavours for our Peace and Quietne&s;s: And if every one would be ready to this, it would make their work very ea&s;ie and de|light&s;om.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>In the la&s;t Place,</HI> I &s;hall Commend the Practice of the Duty we have been in&s;i&s;ting on, 1. To tho&s;e that are in the Mini&s;try. And, 2. To all the People in general.</P>
