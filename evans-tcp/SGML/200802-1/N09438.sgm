<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>FROM the time that I entered into the practice of medicine, and &s;aw the danger to which the ge|nerality of tho&s;e who had the &s;mall-pox in the na|tural way, were expo&s;ed, I could not but &s;incerely wi&s;h, with every &s;en&s;ible per&s;on of the faculty, that ino|culation might become general.</P>
<P>A con&s;iderable &s;hare of employment in this branch of my profe&s;&s;ion has for upwards of twenty years occurred to me; and altho' I have been &s;o fortunate as not to lo&s;e a patient under inoculation, except one per&s;on, about four|teen years ago, who after the eruption of a few di&s;tinct pu&s;tules died of a fever, which I e&s;teemed wholly inde|pendant of the &s;mall-pox, yet I mu&s;t acknowledge that in &s;ome ca&s;es the &s;ymptoms have co&s;t me not a little anxiety for the event.</P>
<P>Nor have the &s;ub&s;equent effects of this practice always been &s;o favourable as one could wi&s;h; and tho' far from equalling tho&s;e which too often follow the natural &s;mall-pax, either in re&s;pect to difficulty or number, yet they &s;ometimes gave no &s;mall unea&s;ine&s;s to the operator.</P>
<P>It cannot likewi&s;e, it ought not to be concealed, that &s;ome of the inoculated have died under this proce&s;s, even under the care of very able and experienced practitioners. But this number is &s;o &s;mall, that, when compared with the mortality attending the natural &s;mall-pox, it is reduced almo&s;t to a cypher.</P>
<P>The&s;e circum&s;tances, however, tended to di&s;courage the operation in &s;ome degree. Practitioners were cautious of
<PB N="6" REF="012028_0003_0F89435B2D13B7F8">
urging a proce&s;s, of who&s;e event they could not be cer|tain: and parents who were &s;en&s;ible enough to ob&s;erve, that tho' the chance was greatly in their favour, yet as a blank might ca&s;t up again&s;t them, they engaged in it with he&s;itation.</P>
<P>Humanity, as well as a wi&s;h to promote the honour and advantage of the art I profe&s;s, made me ever attentive to the improvement of this part of my employment. Di&s;&s;ati&s;|fied with the common methods, I had carefully attended to the circum&s;tances that &s;eemed to contribute to the good or ill &s;ucce&s;s of this practice in the cour&s;e of my own bu&s;ine&s;s, as well as to the be&s;t information I could get of the &s;ucce&s;s of others.</P>
<P>Many facts had induced me to think, that regimen, pre|paration and management would do much: that as the di&s;ea&s;e was of an inflammatory kind, a cooling regimen mu&s;t certainly for the mo&s;t part be rea&s;onable. Some faint e&s;&s;ays were made to try how far this &s;entiment might be ju&s;t. But tho&s;e who are the be&s;t acquainted with the fir&s;t aphori&s;m of Hippocrates, will be the fir&s;t in ju&s;tifying a cautious procedure, where the object is no le&s;s than the life of an individual.</P>
<P>In this &s;ituation I fir&s;t heard, and with the utmo&s;t &s;a|tisfaction, that in &s;ome parts of the nation, a new and more &s;ucce&s;sful method of inoculating was di&s;covered, than had hitherto been practi&s;ed. The relators gave incredible accounts of the &s;ucce&s;s, which was the more marvellous, as the operators were chiefly &s;uch, as by report could lay but little claim to medical erudition.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="012028_0004_0F89435BE9610098">Knowing that improvements which would do honour to the mo&s;t elevated human under&s;tandings, are &s;ometimes &s;tumbled upon by men of more confined abilities; and that in medicine, as well as in every other circum&s;tance in life, it is our duty to avail our&s;elves as much as po&s;&s;ible, of all di&s;coveries tending to the common benefit, I embraced every <HI>ju&s;t opportunity</HI> of informing my&s;elf of facts, circum|&s;tances and events, that either public fame, or more pre|ci&s;e relations brought to me. I u&s;e the term <HI>ju&s;t oppor|tunity,</HI> becau&s;e, if I am not mi&s;informed, endeavours have been u&s;ed, incon&s;i&s;tent with equity and candour, to rob tho&s;e who are intitled to our gratitude for a&s;&s;i&s;ting us in this im|portant proce&s;s, of that &s;hare of private emolument which is their due, let their title to the di&s;covery be ever &s;o pa|radoxical.</P>
<P>To expo&s;e patients, even in the inoculated &s;mall-pox, to all weathers, was a thing unheard of. To permit them through the whole progre&s;s of the di&s;ea&s;e to go abroad, and follow their u&s;ual vocations, and that they &s;hould neither &s;uffer any pre&s;ent evil, nor experience any di&s;agreeable con|&s;equences, was &s;till more &s;urprizing; yet an infinite num|ber of in&s;tances have confirmed all this; and &s;ome of the&s;e in&s;tances will appear in the &s;equel of this performance.</P>
<P>The de&s;ign of this treati&s;e is to bring the practice &s;till one &s;tep nearer to perfection, and le&s;&s;en the ravages of a di&s;temper, which is not a native of Britain, but, like the plague, has been imported from a foreign country, and de|mands the exertion of all the powers we are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of, either to exterminate it from among&s;t us, which perhaps is not practicable, or to render it le&s;s un&s;afe, if not wholly without difficulty or danger.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="012028_0005_0F89435CC8570668">The following directions for this purpo&s;e are the re&s;ult of an exten&s;ive practice: and if a &s;trong per&s;ua&s;ion of the truth of what he writes, founded on repeated trials, and impartial ob&s;ervations, &s;hould have led the author to ex|pre&s;s him&s;elf in a very &s;anguine manner, the future ex|perience of others, he tru&s;ts, will be his ju&s;tification.</P>

<HEAD>Of the <HI>AGE, CONSTITUTION</HI> and <HI>SEASON</HI> of the Year proper for <HI>INOCULATION.</HI></HEAD>
<P>BEFORE I proceed to de&s;cribe the regimen and preparatives, it may not be improper to mention what has occurred to me in re&s;pect to the mo&s;t &s;uitable age and con&s;titution for in|oculation, and likewi&s;e what &s;ea&s;ons &s;eem to be more or le&s;s favourable for the practice.</P>
<P>In regard to age, where it is left to my choice, I decline inoculating children under two years old. I know the common practice is again&s;t me in this parti|cular; but my rea&s;ons for rejecting &s;uch are founded on ob&s;ervation and experience. I have, indeed, lately inoculated many under this age, at the pre&s;&s;ing en|treaties of their parents, and they have all done well. But it mu&s;t be con&s;idered, that young children are ex|po&s;ed to all the hazards of dentition, fevers, fluxes, convul&s;ions, and other accidents, &s;ufficiently difficult in them&s;elves to manage in &s;uch tender &s;ubjects, in&s;o|much that &s;carce two in three of all that are born, live to be two years old, as is demon&s;trable from the Bills of Mortality.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides convul&s;ive paroxy&s;ms often accompany the variolous eruptive fever in children; and tho' generally looked upon in no unfavourable light, as often pre|ceding a di&s;tinct kind of &s;mall-pox, yet they are at all times attended with &s;ome degree of danger; nay, many, it is well known, have expired under them, while others, who have &s;truggled through with great difficulty, have been &s;o debilitated, and their faculties &s;o impaired, that the effects have been perceptible during the remaining part of their lives.</P>
<P>And even admitting the eruption to be favourable, and not attended with any &s;uch alarm, yet &s;hould a larger number of pu&s;tules than u&s;ual appear, or any
<PB N="10" REF="012028_0007_0F89435EEA78D938">
untoward &s;ymptom happen, and require medical help, the unhappy &s;ufferer is much too young to be prevailed on to take unpalatable medicines, or &s;ubmit to other nece&s;&s;ary mea&s;ures, by per&s;ua&s;ions, menaces or bribes. I have often been pre&s;ent at afflicting &s;cenes of this na|ture; and have rea&s;on to think that many children have died of the &s;mall-pox in the natural way, merely from the impo&s;&s;ibility of prevailing upon them to comply with what was proper in ca&s;es where little or no danger was di&s;coverable, either from the number or &s;pecies of the pu&s;tules, the degree of fever, or any other appa|rent cau&s;e.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t likewi&s;e be taken into con&s;ideration, that young children have u&s;ually a larger &s;hare of pu&s;tules from inoculation, than tho&s;e who are advanced a little farther in life; and that under this circum&s;tance it is well known many have died; and the proportion of the&s;e, &s;o far as I can learn, is too great to encourage a continuance in the inoculation of young children; &s;o that it &s;eems mo&s;t prudent to wait till this dangerous period be over, e&s;pecially as its duration is &s;o &s;hort, that the danger of their receiving the &s;mall-pox therein in the natural way is very little; and it is at this time much more ea&s;y to pre&s;erve them from it, than when they are left more to them&s;elves, and may be more in the way of infection. But children above this period may be inoculated more freely; nor does there appear any rea&s;on to exclude healthy adults of any age, per|&s;ons of &s;eventy having pa&s;&s;ed thro' this proce&s;s with the utmo&s;t ea&s;e, and without occa&s;ioning the lea&s;t painful apprehen&s;ion for the event.</P>
<P>In re&s;pect to con&s;titution greater liberties may be taken than have heretofore been judged admi&s;&s;ible: per&s;ons afflicted with various chronic complaints, of &s;crophulous, &s;corbutic and arthritic habits; per&s;ons of unwieldy corpulency, and of intemperate and irregular lives, have all pa&s;&s;ed through this di&s;ea&s;e, with as much ea&s;e and &s;afety as the mo&s;t temperate, healthy and re|gular. But tho&s;e who labour under any acute or cri|tical di&s;ea&s;es, or their effects, are obviou&s;ly unfit and
<PB N="11" REF="012028_0008_0F89435FACFCFBA8">
improper &s;ubjects. So likewi&s;e are tho&s;e where there are evident marks of corro&s;ive acrimonious humors, or where there is a manife&s;t debility of the whole frame from inanition or any other cau&s;e; all the&s;e &s;hould be treated in a proper manner previous to the introduction of this di&s;ea&s;e. Con&s;titutions di&s;po&s;ed to frequent re|turns of intermittens, &s;eem likewi&s;e ju&s;tly exceptionable, e&s;pecially as the preparatory regimen may in &s;ome ha|bits increa&s;e this tendency. I have known, however, in&s;tances of &s;evere ague fits attacking per&s;ons between the in&s;ertion of the matter and the eruption of the pock, and even during maturation, when the bark has been given liberally and with &s;ucce&s;s, the principal bu&s;i|ne&s;s, in the mean time, &s;uffering no injury or inter|ruption.</P>
<P>Among the circum&s;tances generally con&s;idered as more or le&s;s propitious to inoculation, the &s;ea&s;on of the year has hitherto been deemed a matter of &s;ome im|portance. Spring and autumn, for the mo&s;t part, have been recommended as being the mo&s;t temperate &s;ea&s;ons; the cold of winter, and the &s;ummer heats, having been judged unfavourable for this proce&s;s. But experience does not ju&s;tify the&s;e opinions; for according to the be&s;t ob&s;ervation I have been able to make, inoculated per&s;ons have generally had more pu&s;tules in &s;pring than at any other time of the year; and epidemic di&s;ea&s;es being commonly mo&s;t frequent in autumn, e&s;pecially fluxes, intermittens and ulcerated &s;ore throats, all which are liable to mix more or le&s;s with the &s;mall-pax, the autumn, upon this account, does not &s;eem to be the mo&s;t favourable &s;ea&s;on in general.</P>
<P>My opinion is, that, con&s;idering the &s;urprizing and indi&s;putable benefits ari&s;ing at all times to patients in the &s;mall-pox, from the free admi&s;&s;ion of fre&s;h cool air and evacuations, which will appear from &s;ome ca&s;es hereafter &s;ubjoined, we may &s;afely inoculate in all &s;ea|&s;ons, provided care be taken to &s;creen the patients as much as po&s;&s;ible from heat in &s;ummer, and to prevent them from keeping them&s;elves too warm, and too much &s;hut up, as they are naturally di&s;po&s;ed to do, from the
<PB N="12" REF="012028_0009_0F89436069A14D88">
weather in winter. And it is well known, that many have been inoculated in the depth of winter, and &s;ome during the greate&s;t heat in &s;ummer, without &s;uffering any injury or inconvenience from either.</P>
<P>When &s;ea&s;ons, however, are marked with any pe|culiar epidemics, of &s;uch a kind e&s;pecially as may ren|der a mild di&s;ea&s;e more untractable, it may perhaps be mo&s;t prudent not to inoculate while &s;uch di&s;ea&s;es are prevalent.</P>
<P>An eminent phy&s;ician of my acquaintance in Lon|don, at that time in con&s;iderable bu&s;ine&s;s, informed me, that in the year 1756 the &s;mall-pox were very rife, in the &s;ummer of that year e&s;pecially. That in mo&s;t of them the throat was &s;o much affected, that about the &s;eventh day from the eruption, when they ought to have taken liquors in abundance, they could not &s;wal|low a drop. The ptyali&s;m was in the mean time co|pious; and the kind being for the mo&s;t part confluent, they died on the tenth or eleventh day; and tho&s;e who peri&s;hed of this di&s;temper, and much the majority pe|ri&s;hed, all &s;uffered from this cau&s;e. This in&s;tance is only given to &s;hew the nece&s;&s;ity of regarding the ge|neral &s;tate of epidemics when we go into this opera|tion; and to excite tho&s;e who are friends to this mo&s;t beneficial di&s;covery, to u&s;e every means in their power to provide again&s;t a &s;ingle in&s;tance of ill &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of the <HI>PREPARATION.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IN directing the preparatory regimen, I principally aim at the&s;e points: to reduce the patient, if in high health, to a low and more &s;ecure &s;tate; to &s;trengthen the con&s;titution, if too low; to correct what appears vitiated, and to clear the &s;tomach and bowels, as much as may be, from all crudities and their effects. With this view, I order &s;uch of my patients, as con&s;ti|tute the fir&s;t cla&s;s, and who are by much the majority, to live in the following manner: to ab&s;tain from all animal food, including broths, al&s;o butter and chee&s;e, and from all fermented liquors, excepting &s;mall beer,
<PB N="13" REF="012028_0010_0F89436129936AD8">
which is allowed &s;paringly, and from all &s;pices, and whatever po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a manife&s;t heating quality. The diet is to con&s;i&s;t of pudding, gruel, &s;ago, milk, rice-milk, fruit pyes, greens, roots, and vegetables of all the kinds in &s;ea&s;on, prepared or raw. Eggs, tho' not to be eat alone, are allowed in puddings, and butter in pye-cru&s;t; the patients are to be careful that they do not eat &s;uch a quantity as to overload their &s;tomachs, even of this kind of food. Tea, coffee, or chocolate are permitted for breakfa&s;t, to tho&s;e who choo&s;e or are accu&s;tomed to them.</P>
<P>In this manner they are to proceed about nine or ten days before the operation; during which period, at nearly equal di&s;tances, they are directed to take three do&s;es of the following powder, either made into pills, or mixed with a little &s;yrup or jelly, at bed-time, and a do&s;e of Glauber's &s;alt, di&s;&s;olved in thin water-gruel, each &s;ucceeding morning.</P>
<P>The powder is compo&s;ed of eight Grains of calomel, the &s;ame quantity of the compound powder of crabs claws, and one eighth part of a grain of emetic tartar. In&s;tead of emetic tartar, I have &s;ometimes &s;ub&s;tituted two grains of precipitated &s;ulphur of antimony. In order to facilitate the divi&s;ion of the do&s;es, a large quantity is prepared at once, and great care taken that the mixture is well performed.</P>
<P>This quantity is u&s;ually &s;ufficient for a healthy &s;trong man; and the do&s;e mu&s;t be le&s;&s;ened for women or children according to their age and &s;trength, as well as for per&s;ons advanced in years.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t do&s;e is commonly ordered at the com|mencement of the cour&s;e; the &s;econd, three or four days after; and the third, about the eighth or ninth day; and I chu&s;e to inoculate the day after the la&s;t do&s;e has been taken. On the days of purging, broths are allowed, and the patients are de&s;ired to ab&s;tain from unprepared vegetables.</P>
<P>What has hitherto been &s;aid concerning the prepara|tion, mu&s;t be con&s;idered as proper only for the young or middle aged, in a good &s;tate of health; but among
<PB N="14" REF="012028_0011_0F894361E9B71B90">
tho&s;e who are de&s;irous of inoculation, are often found tender, delicate and weakly women, men of bad &s;ta|mina, valetudinarians by con&s;titution, by illne&s;s, or intemperance, al&s;o aged per&s;ons and children; and for the&s;e a very different treatment is directed; a milder cour&s;e of medicine, rather of the alterative than purga|tive kind, is here preferable; and in many in&s;tances, an indulgence in &s;ome light animal food, with a gla&s;s or two of wine in ca&s;e of lowne&s;s, is not only allowable, but nece&s;&s;ary to &s;upport a proper degree of &s;trength, e&s;pecially in advanced age.</P>
<P>Children, who&s;e bowels are often tender, and ought not be ruffled by &s;trong purges, yet require a mild mer|curial, and bear it well: be&s;ides emptying the bowels of crudities, it is a good &s;ecurity again&s;t worms and their effects, which are &s;ometimes of them&s;elves per|plexing enough, and produce very alarming and even fatal di&s;orders.</P>
<P>Indeed the particular &s;tate of health of every per&s;on entering upon the preparatory cour&s;e &s;hould be inquired into and con&s;idered. Inattention to this has, I am &s;a|tisfied, done great mi&s;chief, and particularly the indi&s;|creet u&s;e of mercurials, whereby a &s;alivation has often been rai&s;ed, to the ri&s;que of impairing good con&s;titu|tions, and the ruin of &s;uch as were previou&s;ly weak and infirm. The di&s;tinctions and treatment nece&s;&s;ary, will be obvious to tho&s;e who are acquainted with the animal oeconomy and medical practice.</P>
<P>The time of men&s;truation has generally been the guide in re&s;pect to the inoculation of women; that the whole of the di&s;ea&s;e might be over within the men&s;trual period. This I commonly ob&s;erve, when I can chu&s;e my time without any inconvenience, and inoculate &s;oon after the evacuation cea&s;es: tho' I have no rea&s;on to decline performing the operation at any time, as I can produce many examples in which no inconvenience has ari&s;en, nor any difference been ob&s;ervable, when this circum&s;tance has been di&s;regarded.</P>
<P>Women with child have likewi&s;e been inoculated and done well, yet &s;ome particular emergency &s;hould
<PB N="15" REF="012028_0012_0F894362A9C3C9A8">
be pleaded in excu&s;e for it in their &s;ituation, as it may be attended with &s;ome hazard. I have not inoculated any women whom I knew to be pregnant; but &s;ome who concealed their pregnancy, have been inoculated by me, who, I fancy, hoped for an event that did not happen, I mean mi&s;carriages; one of the&s;e had a child born nine weeks after inoculation, at the full time, with di&s;tinct marks of the di&s;ea&s;e, tho' the mother had very few eruptions.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Of <HI>INFECTION.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE manner of communicating this di&s;temper by inoculation in this country, has of late been the following: A thread is drawn thro' a ripe pu&s;tule, and well moi&s;tened with the matter: a piece of this thread is in&s;inuated into a &s;uperficial inci&s;ion made in one or both arms, near the part where i&s;&s;ues are u&s;ually fixed; this thread is covered with a plai&s;ter, and there left for a day or two. This is the mo&s;t u&s;ual way, tho' others have been practi&s;ed by &s;everal in the profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>At pre&s;ent, very different methods are pu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ued; two of which, that vary in &s;ome re&s;pects, I have frequently practi&s;ed, and &s;hall de&s;cribe; but the following has been &s;o invariably &s;ucce&s;sful as to induce me to give it the preference.</P>
<P>The patient to be infected being in the &s;ame hou&s;e, and, if no objection is made to it, in the &s;ame room, with one who has the di&s;ea&s;e, a little of the variolous matter is taken from the place of in&s;ertion, if the &s;ubject is under inoculation; or a ripe pu&s;tule, if in the natural way, on the point of a lancet, &s;o that both &s;ides of the point are moi&s;tened.</P>
<P>With this lancet an inci&s;ion is made in that part of the arm where i&s;&s;ues are u&s;ually placed, deep enough to pa&s;s through the &s;carf &s;kin, and ju&s;t to touch the &s;kin it&s;elf, and in length as &s;hort as po&s;&s;ible, not more than one eighth of an inch.</P>
<P>The little wound being then &s;tretched open between the finger and thumb of the operator, the inci&s;ion is
<PB N="16" REF="012028_0013_0F8943636A9F4CF8">
moi&s;tened with the matter, by gently touching it with the flat &s;ide of the infected lancet. This operation is generally performed in both arms, and &s;ometimes in two places in one arm, a little di&s;tant from each other. For as I have not ob&s;erved any inconvenience from two or three inci&s;ions, I &s;eldom tru&s;t to one, that neither I nor my patient may be under any doubt about the &s;uc|ce&s;s of the operation from its being performed in one place only.</P>
<P>I have al&s;o tried the following method, with the &s;ame &s;ucce&s;s as that above de&s;cribed, but do not &s;o well ap|prove of it, becau&s;e I have been credibly informed that it has &s;ometimes failed in the practice of others. A lancet being moi&s;tened with the variolous fluid in the &s;ame manner as in the other, is gently introduced in an oblique manner between the &s;carf and true &s;kin, and the finger of the operator is applied on the point, in order to wipe off the infection from the lancet, when it is withdrawn. In this method, as well as in the former, a little blood will &s;ometimes appear; but I neither draw blood with de&s;ign, nor do I think it nece&s;&s;ary to wipe it off before the matter is introduced.</P>
<P>In both the&s;e ways of inoculating, neither plai&s;ter, bandage or covering is applied, or in any re&s;pect ne|ce&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>The&s;e methods of producing the di&s;ea&s;e never once have failed me: and experience has &s;ufficiently proved, that there is no danger from additional infection by the natural di&s;ea&s;e at the &s;ame time. I therefore make no &s;cruple of having the per&s;on to be inoculated, and the patient from whom the infection is to be taken, in the &s;ame room; nor have ever perceived any ill con&s;equences attending it. But I advi&s;e the inocu|lated patients (tho' perhaps there is no nece&s;&s;ity for that precaution) to be afterwards &s;eparated from places of infection till certain &s;igns of &s;ucce&s;s appear, when all re|&s;traint is removed, there being no danger from accu|mulation.</P>
<P>It &s;eems to be of no con&s;equence whether infecting matter be taken from the natural or inoculated &s;mall-pox,
<PB N="17" REF="012028_0014_0F8943642AF98E70">
I have u&s;ed both, and never have been able to di&s;cover the lea&s;t difference, either in point of certainty of infection, the progre&s;s, or the event; and therefore I take the infection from either, as opportunity offers, or at the option of my patients or their friends.</P>
<P>Nor is it of con&s;equence whether the matter be taken before or at the cri&s;is of the di&s;temper. It is, I be|lieve, generally &s;uppo&s;ed, that the &s;mall-pox is not in|fectious till after the matter has acquired a certain de|gree of maturity; and in the common method of in|oculation, this is much attended to; and when the ope|ration has failed, it has commonly been a&s;cribed to the unripene&s;s of the matter.</P>
<P>But it appears very clearly from the pre&s;ent practice of inoculation, that &s;o &s;oon as any moi&s;ture can be taken from the infected part of an inoculated patient, previous to the appearance of any pu&s;tules, and even previous to the eruptive fever, this moi&s;ture is capable of commu|nicating the &s;mall-pox with the utmo&s;t certainty. I have taken a little clear fluid from the elevated pellicle on the inci&s;ed part, even &s;o early as the fourth day after the operation; and have at other times u&s;ed matter fully dige&s;ted after the cri&s;is, with equal &s;ucce&s;s. I chu&s;e, however, in general, to take matter for infection during the fever of eruption, as I &s;uppo&s;e it at that time to have its utmo&s;t activity.</P>
<P>In all ca&s;es when I take matter from an inoculated per&s;on, it is from the place where it was in&s;erted; as I am always &s;ure to find infection there, if the di&s;ea&s;e &s;uc|ceeds, and always of &s;ufficient energy.</P>
<P>It may appear &s;trange, that no bandage, dre&s;&s;ing or application what&s;oever is made u&s;e of to the part in|fected; but that, the mo&s;t &s;imple inci&s;ion being made, and moi&s;tened with the &s;malle&s;t particle of the recent fluid matter, the whole is committed to nature. This method is however perfectly right, becau&s;e the appli|cation of either plai&s;ter or unguent, as is the u&s;ual practice, will occa&s;ion an inflammation on &s;ome &s;kins, and in all tend to di&s;gui&s;e the natural appearance of the inci&s;ion, and prevent our forming a proper judgment
<PB N="18" REF="012028_0015_0F894364EB35DFD8">
of the progre&s;s of the infection, which will afterwards appear to be a matter of much importance.</P>
<P>If neither an inoculated patient is at hand, nor any one in the neighbourhood has a di&s;tinct kind of the na|tural di&s;ea&s;e, a thread may be u&s;ed as in the common manner, provided the thread be very recently infected, but I think it ought to be u&s;ed as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, after being charged with infecting matter.</P>
<P>The following method of introducing the di&s;ea&s;e has likewi&s;e been found effectual, but I have never practi&s;ed it my&s;elf. Dip the point of a lancet in variolous mat|ter, let it be held in the air till it is dry, after which it may be clo&s;ed and kept in the common ca&s;e without any further care; and with this prepared lancet rai&s;e the &s;carf &s;kin obliquely, and keep the lancet a little time in motion between the two &s;kins, that part of the matter may be mixed with the animal juices; then withdraw the lancet, and leave the inci&s;ion uncovered as before.</P>

<HEAD>Of the <HI>PROGRESS</HI> of <HI>INFECTION.</HI></HEAD>
<P>HITHERTO very little regard &s;eems to have been paid to the progre&s;s of infection di&s;cover|able by the part where the operation was performed. But it will appear in the &s;equel, that an attention to this circum&s;tance is very nece&s;&s;ary, becau&s;e a ju&s;t pro|gno&s;tick may thence be &s;ometimes formed of the future &s;tate of the di&s;temper, and indications may be taken from the different appearances on the arm, that will en|able us to prevent inconveniencies.</P>
<P>The former method of covering the place of inci&s;ion with a plai&s;ter, and continuing upon it dre&s;&s;ings of one &s;ort or another, prevented much u&s;eful information of this kind. They prevented any judgment by the touch, and &s;ometimes rendered that by the eye equivocal.</P>
<P>The day after the operation is performed, though it takes effect, little alteration is di&s;coverable. On the &s;econd day, if the part is viewed with a lens, there ge|nerally appears a kind of orange-coloured &s;tain about the inci&s;ion, and the &s;urrounding &s;kin &s;eems to contract.
<PB N="19" REF="012028_0016_0F894365AA9876F8">
At this time I u&s;ually give the following medicine at going to bed, either mixed with a little of any kind of jelly, or more frequently made into a pill:</P>
<P>Calomel and compound powder of crabs claws, of each 3 grains, emetic tartar one tenth of a grain.</P>
<P>A quantity of this medicine &s;hould be carefully pre|pared at once, in order to make the divi&s;ion more exact.</P>
<P>On the fourth or fifth day, upon applying the finger, a hardne&s;s is to be felt by the touch. The patient per|ceives an itching on the part, which appears &s;lightly in|flamed, and under a kind of ve&s;ication is &s;een a little clear fluid, the part re&s;embles a &s;uperficial burn. About the &s;ixth, mo&s;t commonly &s;ome pain and &s;tiffne&s;s is felt in the axilla; and this is a very plea&s;ing &s;ymptom, as it not only foretells the near approach of the eruptive &s;ymptoms, but is a &s;ign of a favourable progre&s;s of the di&s;ea&s;e. Sometimes on the &s;eventh, oftener on the eighth day, &s;ymptoms of the eruptive fever appear; &s;uch as &s;light remitting pains in the head and back, &s;ucceeded by tran&s;ient &s;hiverings and alternate heats, which in a greater or le&s;s degree continue till the erup|tion is perfected. At this time al&s;o it is u&s;ual for the patient to complain of a very di&s;agreeable ta&s;te in his mouth, the breath is always fetid, and their &s;mell dif|ferent from what I have even ob&s;erved in any ca&s;e, ex|cept in the variolous eruptive fever.</P>
<P>The inflammation in the arms at this time &s;preads fa&s;t, and upon viewing it with a good gla&s;s, the in|ci&s;ion, for the mo&s;t part, appears &s;urrounded with an infinite number of &s;mall confluent pu&s;tules, which in|crea&s;e in &s;ize and extent as the di&s;ea&s;e advances. On the tenth or eleventh day a circular or oval efflore&s;cence is u&s;ually di&s;covered, &s;urrounding the inci&s;ion, and ex|tending &s;ometimes near half round the arm, but more frequently to about the &s;ize of a &s;hilling, and being under the cuticle, is &s;mooth to the touch, and not pain|ful. This appearance is al&s;o a very plea&s;ing one; it ac|companies eruption, every di&s;agreeable &s;ymptom cea&s;es, and at the &s;ame time it certainly indicates the whole
<PB N="20" REF="012028_0017_0F8943666B531468">
affair to be over, the pain and &s;tiffne&s;s in the axilla al&s;o going off.</P>
<P>The feveri&s;h &s;ymptoms are for the mo&s;t part &s;o mild, as &s;eldom to require any medicinal a&s;&s;i&s;tance, except a repetition of the &s;ame medicine that was directed on the &s;econd night after the operation; and on the following morning this laxative draught, to procure three or four &s;tools;</P>
<P>Infu&s;ion of &s;ena two ounces, manna half an ounce, tincture of jalap two drams.</P>
<P>The&s;e are given as &s;oon as the eruptive &s;ymptoms are perceivable, if they &s;eem to indicate any uncommon degree of vehemence.</P>
<P>It has been ob&s;erved, that by attending to the pro|gre&s;s of infection, we may be able to progno&s;ticate, with &s;ome degree of certainty, the event of the di&s;tem|per in general. Particular incidents will ever happen, but not &s;ufficient to de&s;troy the propriety of general rules.</P>
<P>If the appearances already de&s;cribed are ob&s;erved early, a very favourable event is implied: but it hap|pens in &s;ome ca&s;es, although it may be perceived that the inoculation has &s;ucceeded, yet it is barely per|ceptible, the colour about the wound remaining pale, in&s;tead of changing to red or inflamed; the edges of the inci&s;ion &s;pread but little, they remain flat, &s;carcely ri&s;ing at all, and are attended neither with itching or unea&s;ine&s;s of any kind. Nay, &s;ometimes on the fifth, and even the &s;ixth day, the alteration is &s;o little, as to make it doubtful whether the infection has taken place.</P>
<P>When matters are in this &s;tate, the appearance is un|favourable, and implies a late and more untoward di&s;|ea&s;e: To prevent which, I direct the powder or pill to be taken each night; and in ca&s;e it fails to operate by &s;tool, or there is the lea&s;t di&s;po&s;ition to co&s;tivene&s;s, an ounce of Glauber's &s;alts, or more commonly the laxa|tive draught already mentioned, is given in the morn|ing, once or twice, as the ca&s;e may require. This cour&s;e forwards the inflammation, which I always wi&s;h to &s;ee; as I have con&s;tantly ob&s;erved, that an early progre&s;s on
<PB N="21" REF="012028_0018_0F8943672B4627D0">
the arm, and an early commencement of the eruptive complaints, portend that the di&s;temper will be mild and favourable; and on the contrary, where both are late, the &s;ymptoms are u&s;ually more irregular and untoward.</P>
<P>Being now arrived at the mo&s;t intere&s;ting period of this di&s;temper, the eruption, a period in which the pre&s;ent practice I am about to recommend, differs e&s;|&s;entially from the method heretofore in u&s;e, and on the right management of which much depends, it will be requi&s;ite to give clear and explicit directions on this head, and to advi&s;e their being pur&s;ued with firmne&s;s and moderation.</P>
<P>In&s;tead of confining the patient to his bed, or his room, when the &s;ymptoms of the eruptive fever come on, he is directed, as &s;oon as the purging medicine has operated, to keep abroad in the open air, be it ever &s;o cold, as much as he can bear, and to drink cold water, if thir&s;ty, always taking care not to &s;tand &s;till, but to walk about moderately while abroad.</P>
<P>This treatment indeed &s;eems as hard at fir&s;t to the patients, as it mu&s;t appear &s;ingular to the reader; but the effects are &s;o &s;alutary, and &s;o con&s;tantly confirmed by experience, and an ea&s;y progre&s;s thro' every &s;tage of the di&s;ea&s;e depends &s;o much upon it, that I admit of no exception, unle&s;s the weather be extremely &s;evere, and the con&s;titution very delicate. And it is indi&s;putably true, that in the few in&s;tances where the &s;ymptoms of eruption have run very high, the patients dreading any motion, and fearing the cold as the greate&s;t evil; yet, when under the&s;e circum&s;tances I have per&s;uaded them to ri&s;e out of bed and go out of doors, though led &s;ometimes by two a&s;&s;i&s;tants, and have allowed them to drink as much cold water as they cho&s;e, they have not &s;uffered the lea&s;t &s;ini&s;ter accident. On the contrary, after they have been prevailed on, although reluctantly, to comply with the&s;e directions, they find their &s;pirits revived, an inclination for nouri&s;hment returns; they re&s;t well; a gentle &s;weat &s;ucceeds, accompanied with a favourable eruption, and the fever &s;eems wholly to be extingui&s;hed.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="012028_0019_0F894367EA1C6D10">In general the complaints in this &s;tate are very mode|rate, and attended with &s;o little illne&s;s, that the patient eats and &s;leeps well the whole time: a few pu&s;tules ap|pear, &s;ometimes equally di&s;per&s;ed, &s;ometimes the in|flammations on the arms &s;pread, and are &s;urrounded with a few pu&s;tules, which gradually advance to matu|rity; during which time, for the mo&s;t part, the eruption proceeds kindly, and there is much more difficulty to re&s;train the patients within due bounds, prevent them from mixing with the public, and &s;preading the in|fection (which I always endeavour to prevent) than there was at fir&s;t to prevail upon them to go abroad. During this time, medicine is &s;eldom wanted, the cool air &s;eems the be&s;t cordial; and if any uncommon languor happens, a ba&s;on of &s;mall broth, or a gla&s;s of wine, is allowed in the day, or &s;ome white wine whey at bed time; which are indeed at any time allowed to tender, aged or weakly per&s;ons.</P>
<P>With the&s;e exceptions they have hitherto been kept very &s;crupulou&s;ly to the diet at fir&s;t directed. But after the eruption is compleated, if occa&s;ion requires, they are indulged in a little well-boiled meat of the lighte&s;t kind, as chicken, veal or mutton.</P>
<P>The regimen above mentioned, the cooling alterative purges, and the free u&s;e of cool air at the &s;ea&s;on of eruption, almo&s;t univer&s;ally prevent either alarming &s;ymptoms, or a large crop of pu&s;tules. A few I have &s;een with &s;uch a quantity of pu&s;tules, tho' di&s;tinct, that I have neither advi&s;ed nor allowed them to go out of the hou&s;e. But the generality of my patients, when the eruptions are few, amu&s;e them&s;elves abroad within proper limits, with the pu&s;tules out upon them.</P>
<P>I neither enjoin this, nor maintain that it is nece&s;&s;ary; but have not been able to ob&s;erve that any inconvenience has ari&s;en from it. And how &s;trange &s;oever it may ap|pear, it is true, that tho&s;e who are mo&s;t adventurous, &s;eem to be in better &s;pirits, and more free from com|plaints, than others who are inclined to keep within doors. And indeed, &s;uch of my patients as have re|ceived the benefit of this treatment them&s;elves, &s;eldom
<PB N="23" REF="012028_0020_0F894368AB5A4440">
permit tho&s;e who are in the harde&s;t part of the di&s;tem|per, the eruptive, to keep much in the hou&s;e; encou|raging them to bear a little hard&s;hip, by recounting to them the benefit they have reaped from the method they are recommending.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who have the di&s;ea&s;e in the &s;lighte&s;t manner fir&s;t de&s;cribed, viz. without any appearance of the erup|tion but on the inoculated part, are &s;oon allowed to go about their u&s;ual affairs; and many in&s;tances have hap|pened of very indu&s;trious poor men, who have in&s;tant|ly returned to their daily labour, with a caution not to intermix with tho&s;e who have not had the di&s;temper, for fear of &s;preading it, and with directions to take two or three times of the purge already directed, or as many do&s;es of Glauber's &s;alts. Tho&s;e who have it in a greater degree, are confined &s;omewhat longer, and a very mild laxative is now and then exhibited, if there is the lea&s;t di&s;po&s;ition to co&s;tivene&s;s; as the progre&s;s to maturation appears rather to be advanced than retarded by the ope|ration.</P>
<P>When the maturation is compleated, and it is evident we have nothing further to fear from the di&s;temper, I allow my patients gradually to change their cour&s;e of diet, from the perfectly cooling kind, to one a little more generous; recommending &s;trictly to all a return to their ordinary animal diet with much caution and re|&s;traint upon their appetites, both in re&s;pect to food and fermented liquors.</P>
<P>It is not often that we are under a nece&s;&s;ity of making any application to the part where the operation was per|formed; it mo&s;t commonly heals up, and is covered with a &s;cab, about the time when, in the natural way, all the pocks would have been dried up: But there are &s;ome ca&s;es wherein the inci&s;ions continue to di&s;charge a purulent matter longer; in the&s;e in&s;tances it is &s;ufficient to cover the place with the white cerate, or any other mild empla&s;tic &s;ub&s;tance, which may at once prevent the linen from adhering to the &s;ore, and defend it from the air. And as in the&s;e ca&s;es the part remains unhealed from &s;ome peculiar cau&s;e in the habit, it will be nece&s;|&s;ary

to give gentle purgatives, and proper alteratives, as particular exigencies may require.</P>

<HEAD>Of <HI>ANOMALOUS SYMPTOMS</HI> and <HI>APPEARANCES.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IN the preceding pages I have pre&s;cribed the u&s;ual progre&s;s of the &s;mall-pox from inoculation. There are, however, deviations from this cour&s;e, and indeed not a few; &s;ome of the mo&s;t material of which, as they may embarra&s;s the inexperienced, and create real diffi|culty, as well as apprehen&s;ions of danger, it &s;eems ne|ce&s;&s;ary to de&s;cribe, and the means that experience has &s;ugge&s;ted to remove, the&s;e &s;ymptoms, or the doubts re&s;pecting the event.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t I &s;hall take notice of, and which, tho' it very rarely happens, &s;ometimes gives much trouble, is great &s;ickne&s;s accompanied with vomiting, coming on during the eruptive &s;tate of the di&s;temper. For this complaint it is always nece&s;&s;ary in the fir&s;t place to clear the &s;tomach, which may be effected either by ordering the patient to drink plentifully of warm liquids to pro|mote vomiting, or perhaps more properly, by giving one grain of emetic tartar to an adult, mixed with ten grains of compound powder of crabs claws, taking care to le&s;&s;en the do&s;e for very young and weak &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>This u&s;ually throws off &s;ome bilious matter by vomit, &s;ometimes procures &s;tools, or occa&s;ions a moderate &s;weat, and generally admini&s;ters relief. If, however, no &s;tools &s;hould follow from this medicine, and the &s;ickne&s;s &s;hould remain, a gentle laxative almo&s;t certainly procures a re&s;pite, and the appearance of the eruption removes the complaint entirely.</P>
<P>Another deviation, of &s;till more con&s;equence, which &s;ometimes happens towards the time of the eruption, and is often, tho' not always, accompanied with great &s;ickne&s;s, is an ery&s;ipelatous efflore&s;cence. This, if it &s;hews it&s;elf on the &s;kin partially, and here and there in patches, is not very alarming, and &s;oon wears off.</P>
<P>But &s;ometimes the whole &s;urface of the &s;kin is co|vered with a ra&s;h intimately mixed with the variolous
<PB N="25" REF="012028_0022_0F89436B718CA1A0">
eruption, and &s;o much re&s;embling the mo&s;t malignant kind of confluent &s;mall-pox, as &s;carcely to be di&s;tin|gui&s;hed from it: and indeed &s;ome ca&s;es of this &s;ort have happened, where, being accompanied with pe|techiae and livid &s;pots, I have been much alarmed; not being able, by in&s;pection only, tho' a&s;&s;i&s;ted by gla&s;&s;es, to determine whether what I &s;aw was an inoffen&s;ive ra&s;h, or tokens of the greate&s;t malignity. Very &s;trict atten|tion, however, has enabled me to di&s;tingui&s;h the dif|ference clearly; and the following ob&s;ervation will, I hope, tend to relieve others from the anxiety they would feel upon &s;uch an appearance. The real and e&s;&s;ential difference then is to be gathered from the concomitant &s;ymptoms. In the ery&s;ipelatous or variolous ra&s;h, there is not &s;o much fever, nor is the re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s, or pain of the head or loins, &s;o con&s;iderable; neither is there that general pro&s;tration of &s;trength, which are almo&s;t never-failing attendants on a confluent &s;mall-pox, e&s;pecially when accompanied with &s;uch putrid appearances; be|&s;ides, upon a careful examination, there may &s;ome|times be di&s;cerned a few di&s;tinct pu&s;tules, larger than the re&s;t, mixed with the ra&s;h, which are indeed the real &s;mall-pox. In the&s;e ca&s;es the patients are ordered to re|frain from cold water, or any thing cold; and to keep within doors, but not to go to bed. If any &s;ickne&s;s yet remains, a little white wine whey, or other moderate cordial, is advi&s;ed: and this method has hitherto been &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful, as to prevent any alarming complaint. After two or three days, the &s;kin from a florid changes to a du&s;ky colour, a few di&s;tinct pu&s;tules remain, and advance properly to maturation, without any further trouble en&s;uing from this formidable appearance.</P>
<P>This ra&s;h has been often mi&s;taken for the confluence it &s;o nearly re&s;embles, and has afforded occa&s;ion for &s;ome practitioners, either ignorantly or di&s;ingenuou&s;ly, to pre|tend, that after a very copious eruption of the confluent pox, they can by a &s;pecific medicine di&s;charge the major part of the pu&s;tules, leaving only as many di&s;tinct ones as may &s;atisfy the patient that he has the di&s;ea&s;e. Such preten&s;ions have certainly been made, and the patient
<PB N="26" REF="012028_0023_0F89436BABEB2230">
who has been deceived in this manner, has contributed to &s;pread reports untrue as to the fact, and probably prejudicial to the health of others, who in like circum|&s;tances have been &s;ent abroad, and other cool means pur&s;ued, by which the ra&s;h has been repelled, and the bad effects experienced afterwards.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t al&s;o ob&s;erve here, that ra&s;hes of the kind I have de&s;cribed frequently happen during the preparation (whether owing to the regimen, or medicine, or both, I cannot &s;ay) and cau&s;e the operation to be po&s;tponed: But I have ob&s;erved, that in &s;uch ca&s;es they are apt to return at the time of the eruption of the &s;mall-pox.</P>
<P>In general, as has been already &s;aid, the &s;ymptoms which precede eruption, commence at the end of the &s;eventh or in the eighth day inclu&s;ive from the operation; but it often happens, that they appear much &s;ooner, and &s;ometimes much later, than the time above-mentioned. For in&s;tance, I have &s;een &s;ome ca&s;es wherein the di&s;ea&s;e has happened &s;o &s;uddenly after infection, and with &s;o little complaint or unea&s;ine&s;s, that the whole affair has been terminated, purges taken, and the patient returned home perfectly well in a week's time; before others in|oculated at the &s;ame time, from the &s;ame patient, and under the &s;ame circum&s;tances, have begun to complain. In this ca&s;e the inoculated part &s;hews early certain marks of infection, &s;ometimes on the very next day, or the day after, when the inci&s;ion will often appear con&s;iderably inflamed and elevated. The patient about this time frequently makes &s;ome of the following com|plaints, viz. chilline&s;s, itchings, and &s;mall pricking pains in the part, and &s;ometimes on the &s;houlder, gid|dine&s;s, drow&s;ine&s;s, and a &s;light head-ach, &s;ometimes at|tended with a feveri&s;h heat, but often without any: the account they them&s;elves give of their feelings, is in &s;ome as if they had drank too much, and in others as if they had caught a cold. The&s;e complaints &s;eldom la&s;t 24 hours, often not &s;o long, and with frequent remi&s;|&s;ions, and never, that I remember, ri&s;e to a degree that requires confinement. The inflammation on the arm at the time of the complaints advances apace, and feels

hard to the touch; but upon their wearing off, the in|flamed appearances gradually le&s;&s;en, and the part dries to a common &s;mall &s;cab; the &s;kin that was before red, turns livid, and the party is quite well, and nothing more heard of the di&s;temper <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See ca&s;e 1&mdash;12.</NOTE>. In &s;ome in&s;tances the&s;e &s;ymptoms attack much later, even on the 7th or 8th day, when an eruption might be expected in con|&s;equence of them, yet none appears; but the arm gets well very &s;oon, and the di&s;ea&s;e is at an end.</P>
<P>In this irregular &s;ort of the di&s;order there have how|ever been &s;ome examples where a few eruptions have appeared, and probably in con&s;equence of the inocula|tion; yet the pu&s;tules have not looked like the true pocks, nor maturated like them, nor la&s;ted longer than three days; about which time they, for the mo&s;t part, have dried away.</P>
<P>As I find it difficult to de&s;cribe the variety and irre|gularity of &s;ymptoms that occur in this &s;hort way of having the di&s;temper, I will give &s;ome ca&s;es, by way of illu&s;trating the matter more to the reader's &s;ati&s;|faction.</P>
<P>When &s;ubjects of this &s;ort fir&s;t occurred in my practice, I was in doubt whether they were quite &s;ecure from any future attacks of the di&s;temper; and in order to try whether they were &s;o or not, I inoculated them a &s;econd time, and cau&s;ed them to a&s;&s;ociate with per&s;ons in every &s;tage of the di&s;ea&s;e, and to try all other means of catching the infection; and this method has been practi&s;ed with the generality of &s;uch patients ever &s;ince; yet without a &s;ingle in&s;tance of its producing any di&s;|order; &s;o that I now make no &s;cruple of pronouncing them perfectly &s;afe: and experience has enabled me for the mo&s;t part to foretell, in two or three days after the operation, when the di&s;ea&s;e will pa&s;s in this &s;light manner.</P>
<P>Upon the &s;econd inoculation, however, the inci&s;ed parts are commonly inflamed for a day or two, ju&s;t in the &s;ame manner as I have, in numerous in&s;tances, found them to be as well in tho&s;e, who, though cer|tain
<PB N="28" REF="012028_0025_0F89436D679312B0">
of having had the &s;mall-pox in the natural way, have &s;ubmitted to be inoculated merely for the experi|ment's &s;ake, that the re&s;ult might be ob&s;erved; as in others, who, being doubtful whether they have had it or not, have been inoculated in order to be &s;atisfied. But in all &s;uch ca&s;es the parts &s;oon became well, nor did any of tho&s;e appearances which have been de&s;cribed as the con&s;tant attendants of inoculation, as pain in the head, giddine&s;s, marks of infection in the arm, &amp;c. en&s;ue; nor can they ever be produced upon a per&s;on who has had the &s;mall-pox before, either in the natural way or by inoculation.</P>
<P>And therefore it cannot with rea&s;on be &s;ugge&s;ted that the patients, whom I &s;uppo&s;e to get through the di&s;ea&s;e in the very &s;light manner above de&s;cribed, may po&s;&s;ibly have had the &s;mall-pox unob&s;erved in &s;ome for|mer part of their lives.</P>
<P>Another and le&s;s favourable appearance to be men|tioned under this head, is when the inoculated part, though &s;hewing certain &s;igns of infection, yet the di&s;|colouration round it, in&s;tead of being florid, is of a pale hue, remains flat, and is very little elevated. This does not promi&s;e kindly; and therefore I give the al|terative pill more frequently; and if it fails to operate by &s;tool, I add a laxative.</P>
<P>By the&s;e means the advancement of the di&s;ea&s;e is u&s;ually forwarded, which I am always plea&s;ed to &s;ee, and promote as much as po&s;&s;ible; for I have con&s;tantly remarked, that an early &s;eizure is one of the be&s;t &s;igns that the whole progre&s;s will be mild and favourable; and, on the contrary, where it is late, the &s;ymptoms are often irregular and trouble&s;ome.</P>
<P>Another irregularity de&s;erving notice here is, that &s;ometimes, upon the abatement of the fever and other &s;ymptoms, after the appearance of &s;everal pu&s;tules, and when the eruptive &s;tage of the di&s;ea&s;e &s;eems completed, it neverthele&s;s happens that fre&s;h eruptions come out, and continue doing &s;o daily, for 4, 5, or even 6 days &s;ucce&s;&s;ively; preceded &s;ometimes by a &s;light pain in the head, though more frequently they appear without any

new di&s;turbance. The&s;e are generally few in number, &s;hort-lived, and &s;eldom come to maturity. But I have &s;een four ca&s;es, in each of which, after a ce&s;&s;ation of complaints, and an appearance of few pu&s;tules, the eruptive &s;tage of the di&s;ea&s;e was thought to be over; yet in two or three days a fre&s;h fit of fever has attacked the patients, and after a &s;hort illne&s;s a quantity of new pu&s;tules has broke out, far exceeding the fir&s;t number; and the&s;e remained, and maturated completely. In|&s;tances of this kind may be found among the ca&s;es annexed.</P>
<P>Some of my own patients, and, as I am credibly in|formed, of other inoculators in this way, have had con|&s;iderable eruptions of this kind after they returned home; which have probably given occa&s;ion for the reports of &s;everal having had the di&s;ea&s;e again in the natural way after inoculation. But that the&s;e reports are ill grounded, will appear from this ob&s;ervation, to wit, that in all the ca&s;es of this &s;ort which have occurred in my own practice, or, as far as I can learn, in that of others, the &s;econd or latter crop of pu&s;tules has always happened within the time u&s;ually allowed for the pro|gre&s;s of the &s;mall-pox from inoculation, and before the inflammation on the arm has cea&s;ed, and &s;ooner than they could be &s;uppo&s;ed to be produced by infection taken in the natural way; and whenever it has hap|pened, it has been to per&s;ons in whom, after a &s;light eruption, and abatement of &s;ymptoms, the di&s;ea&s;e has prematurely been judged to be quite over, and have therefore been permitted to return to their families.</P>
<P>It will doubtle&s;s be a&s;ked, how ca&s;es of this kind &s;hould ever happen among tho&s;e who return home as cured? to which I an&s;wer, that it is no unu&s;ual thing for indu&s;trious men, after a &s;light eruption, and ce&s;&s;ation of all complai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">, to a&s;k leave to return home to their occupations and families; and where it has been thought that no danger would accrue to others, their reque&s;t has been often granted; for the phy&s;ician no more than the patient can fore&s;ee, when the&s;e accidents &s;hall follow; but it may be ob&s;erved here, that in all the&s;e ca&s;es of

my own knowledge, very repellent methods have been u&s;ed in the beginning, and a more generous diet, or greater exerci&s;e afterwards, has &s;eemed to contribute to this &s;econdary eruption.</P>
<P>Before I conclude this chapter, it may be proper to ob&s;erve, that inoculated patients, in &s;ome &s;tage or other of the di&s;ea&s;e, may po&s;&s;ibly be attacked with di&s;ea&s;es altogether independant of the &s;mall-pox. Such, for in&s;tance, as may ari&s;e from worms, or be the epidemick of the &s;ea&s;on; or &s;uch as the patient may by con&s;titution be &s;ubject to; and &s;ome ca&s;es of this &s;ort will be found among tho&s;e annexed.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CONSEQUENCES</HI> of this Method of <HI>INOCULATION.</HI></HEAD>
<P>I Shall now con&s;ider the con&s;equences that follow this very cool and repelling method, and how far the patient's future &s;tate of health may be affected by a practice &s;o new, and oppo&s;ite to all e&s;tabli&s;hed theory.</P>
<P>I need not &s;ay how much it has been thought right, in mo&s;t or all eruptive complaints, e&s;pecially in the &s;mall-pox, to forward by every gentle means the efforts of nature in producing an eruption; and on the con|trary, how dangerous to check it, either by cold air, cold drink, or any con&s;iderable evacuations; or that the u&s;e of warm diluents therefore, and the lying in bed, e&s;pecially if the fever and &s;ymptoms run high, or at lea&s;t confining to the hou&s;e, have been generally ap|proved and recommended for the purpo&s;e. But when a practice &s;o foreign to this, and almo&s;t totally different, is inculcated, it is no wonder if mens minds are alarm|ed, and tho&s;e evils expected that were &s;uppo&s;ed to be the unavoidable con&s;equences of it.</P>
<P>Experience, however, and in&s;tances of &s;o many thou|&s;ands &s;ucceeding by this method, without any con&s;ider|able bad effects from it, either immediate or remote, are irre&s;i&s;tible arguments for its &s;upport and ju&s;tification, and the be&s;t proof of its utility and &s;afety. I have &s;aid, without any con&s;iderable bad effects, for in reality I have &s;een none that de&s;erve that name, if compared
<PB N="31" REF="012028_0028_0F8943702965CB28">
with what &s;ometimes follow the natural &s;mall-pox, or frequently happen after the old method of inoculation.</P>
<P>Every one who has had any &s;hare in this practice ac|cording to the common or old methods, will allow, that after pa&s;&s;ing through the di&s;ea&s;e in a very favour|able manner, their patients (children e&s;pecially) were frequently liable to ab&s;ce&s;&s;es in the axilla and other parts, tedious ophthalmies, and trouble&s;ome ulcerations in the place of in&s;ertion, which, though they could not be fore&s;een or prevented, yet frequently gave more pain and vexation to the patients, and trouble to the operator, than the di&s;ea&s;e it&s;elf had done: whereas on inquiry into the fate of tho&s;e who have been treated in the cool way or this new method, I can &s;ay that in more than 1500 there has been only one who has had &s;o much as a boil in the axilla, and that was in a child who had an i&s;&s;ue in the &s;ame arm, and which was at that time dried up; and I have only &s;een two very &s;mall &s;uperficial boils in others near the place of in&s;ertion; and the&s;e &s;eemed rather to be occa&s;ioned by an irritation from the di&s;charge, than from any other cau&s;e, and were all &s;oon healed with very little trouble.</P>
<P>In a few in&s;tances al&s;o there has been a &s;lough in the inci&s;ed part, which has made a &s;ore of &s;hort duration, but not one in&s;tance of an ulcer of any continuance. Such little breakings out too and &s;cabs, as are frequent|ly known to &s;ucceed the mild natural &s;mall-pox, &s;ome|times, though rarely, happen to tho&s;e inoculated this way, and as they are of the &s;ame little con&s;equence, are generally cured by the &s;ame method of a few gentle purges.</P>
<P>With regard to ophthalmies from this kind of practice, I have never had an example of one truly de&s;erving that name; the coats of the eye have been a little in|flamed in a very few, but they &s;oon became clear without any means u&s;ed for that purpo&s;e. And I know but two ca&s;es where I thought the inflammation great enough to require bleeding, and not one where a bli&s;ter was nece&s;|&s;ary. So that the&s;e complaints, heretofore &s;o frequent and grievous, &s;eem by this new method to be much re|duced:
<PB N="32" REF="012028_0029_0F894370EA8E12D0">
a circum&s;tance, which, if it does not amount to a proof, admits at lea&s;t of a fair conjecture, that the &s;tate of health is better here, than where tho&s;e remains of putridity are &s;o evidently exi&s;ting in the habit.</P>
<P>Di&s;coveries in phy&s;ic, as in every other &s;cience, are in their infancy liable to cen&s;ure and oppo&s;ition; and to one of &s;o extraordinary a kind as the pre&s;ent &s;y&s;tem of inoculation, it would not be &s;trange if a greater portion of both than u&s;ual &s;hould fall to its &s;hare; ac|cordingly, &s;ince no charge of fatality during the di&s;ea&s;e, nor in&s;tances of bad effects &s;oon after the recovery, can be produced, recour&s;e has been had to other mea&s;ures to calumniate and di&s;credit the practice. It would be tedious to enter into a detail of the many fal&s;e and ridi|culous reports that have been &s;pread again&s;t it. In ge|neral the con&s;titution is &s;aid to be injured, and the dread|ful effects are to appear at &s;ome di&s;tant period, but at what time, or what kind of di&s;ea&s;e, nobody pretends to determine. To the&s;e general accu&s;ations it cannot be expected I &s;hould give other than a general an&s;wer; which is, that from the &s;tricte&s;t ob&s;ervation and inquiry I have been able to make, tho&s;e who have been ino|culated in this way, have continued to enjoy as good a &s;tate of health as their neighbours; nay, many of them have thought their con&s;titution better after the proce&s;s than before.</P>
<P>But it &s;eems as if the&s;e oppo&s;ers expected that in|oculation &s;hould not only free the inoculated from the &s;mall-pox, and any early bad effects, but mu&s;t pre&s;erve them too from all other di&s;orders through the re&s;t of their lives. To &s;uch I can &s;ay nothing; but if others who are more rea&s;onable, require further &s;atisfaction as to the con&s;equences of this method, I mu&s;t de&s;ire them to make inquiry of tho&s;e who have been inoculated under my direction.</P>
<P>Another charge again&s;t this method of inoculation is, that &s;ome have had the di&s;temper afterwards in the na|tural way. What I have &s;aid under the head of ano|malous &s;mall-pox, will, I believe, &s;ufficiently account for the appearances which have occa&s;ioned the&s;e fal&s;e
<PB N="33" REF="012028_0030_0F894371AE6BF110">
reports; and if that does not &s;atisfy, I can only add this po&s;itive declaration, that nothing of the kind has ever happened to any patient inoculated by me; and I firmly believe, no one has ever had, or can have, the di&s;temper a &s;econd time, either in the natural way, or from inoculation.</P>

<HEAD>The <HI>EFFECTS</HI> of this <HI>TREATMENT</HI> applied to the natural <HI>SMALL-POX.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE very great relief which per&s;ons under in|oculation experience from fre&s;h air, cold water, and evacuations by &s;tool, during the fever preceding eruption, &s;oon determined me to make trial, how far the like treatment might be u&s;eful to tho&s;e who might be &s;eized with the &s;mall-pox in the natural way; more e&s;pecially in &s;uch ca&s;es, where from the violence of the &s;ymptoms, a confluent kind was ju&s;tly to be ap|prehended.</P>
<P>But opportunities of making experiments of this &s;ort in a &s;atisfactory manner are rare. Fir&s;t becau&s;e a phy|&s;ician, or even medical a&s;&s;i&s;tance of any kind, is not often called in till the eruption &s;hews it&s;elf, when it is too late to expect all the good effects that might be hoped for from an earlier trial of this method; and &s;e|condly, becau&s;e the fir&s;t attack of the &s;mall-pox is &s;o much like the beginning of &s;ome other fevers as not ea&s;ily to be di&s;tingui&s;hed; though a diligent attention to the &s;ymptoms will generally, if we are called in time, enable us to form a pretty certain progno&s;tic. For if the attack of the cold fit be pretty &s;evere, and the &s;ub&s;equent fever unu&s;ually high; if a nau&s;ea and vomiting &s;ucceed, together with great pains in the head, back and loins, e&s;pecially the la&s;t; if a delirium, great re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s, di&s;agreeable ta&s;te in the mouth, and a pe|culiar fetid &s;mell in the breath, or even if &s;everal of the&s;e &s;ymptoms are ob&s;erved, the &s;mall-pox may with great rea&s;on be expected; and if upon enquiry, which &s;hould always be made, it appears that the patient has
<PB N="34" REF="012028_0031_0F8943726E5E1248">
been in the way of infection, there will be little rea&s;on to doubt of it.</P>
<P>It may be objected, that notwith&s;tanding the clo&s;e&s;t attention and enquiry, &s;ymptoms of the like nature may precede fevers of other kinds; to which I an&s;wer, that &s;ome &s;uch ca&s;es, though few, have happened, and the treatment I am about to recommend, has been practi&s;ed not only without prejudice to the patient, but manife&s;tly to his benefit.</P>
<P>But waving for the pre&s;ent all con&s;iderations re&s;pect|ing the treatment of fevers in general, I &s;hall only relate what has occurred to me in re&s;pect to the natural &s;mall-pox.</P>
<P>In &s;everal in&s;tances where I have been concerned, and where the &s;ymptoms and other concurring circum&s;tances induced me to think the &s;mall-pox was at hand, I have directed the like management as I recommend to in|oculated patients.</P>
<P>I have been called al&s;o to others at the time of erup|tion, where &s;ome pu&s;tules having already appeared, made the matter clear; and in every ca&s;e of this kind, I have endeavoured to get the &s;ick per&s;on into the open air, have generally given the mercurial and antimonial pill, and directed a laxative to be taken &s;ome hours after it, in order to procure three or four &s;tools; and this method I have more particularly enjoined, and &s;ometimes repeated where the kind has appeared to be bad, and where little or no relief has been found from the partial eruption, the &s;ymptoms continuing to be &s;uch as por|tended great danger. I have followed the &s;ame method during every part of the eruptive fever, intending there|by to abate its violence, to check the eruption, and prevent the conflux, and con&s;equently the danger.</P>
<P>The &s;ucce&s;s attending this practice has hitherto ex|ceeded my expectations, though it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that as the &s;ymptoms run much higher in the natural, than they are found to do in the inoculated di&s;ea&s;e, the relief has not been &s;o con&s;iderable; and I have found it extremely difficult to per&s;uade &s;uch who&s;e complaints have been very &s;evere, to quit their beds, and attempt
<PB N="35" REF="012028_0032_0F89437416B45CD8">
to go abroad; indeed the exceeding feeble &s;tate they are &s;ometimes in, &s;ufficiently &s;hews that great re&s;olution is requi&s;ite to put this in practice.</P>
<P>Among tho&s;e who have been treated in this manner under my own care and in&s;pection, not one has died, and the number amounts to about 40. Some of the mo&s;t remarkable ca&s;es will be &s;ubjoined, which will more &s;atisfactorily explain the practice, and demon&s;trate its &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>The immediate &s;en&s;ible effects of going into the open air, are a very great abatement of heat upon the whole &s;urface of the &s;kin, which, tho' but ju&s;t before inten&s;ely hot, generally in a &s;hort time feels not much warmer than that of a per&s;on in health. The pul&s;e from being very &s;trong, full and quick, becomes le&s;s hard and full, but continues quick; and I have &s;ometimes ob&s;erved it to intermit; which, however alarming it may &s;eem, is not a dangerous &s;ymptom.</P>
<P>The pain in the head is always relieved, but that in the back and loins does not abate in proportion; and altho' it co&s;ts no little pain and trouble to per&s;i&s;t in moving abroad under &s;uch circum&s;tances, attended for the mo&s;t part with great la&s;&s;itude, yet the patients are &s;en&s;ible of the benefits they receive, and entertaining a good opinion of the u&s;efulne&s;s of the practice, com|monly behave with great re&s;olution, and, what is very encouraging, in general think them&s;elves &s;tronger.</P>
<P>Upon going within doors to re&s;t them&s;elves, the pain in the head grows wor&s;e, but is again relieved &s;o &s;oon as they return into the air.</P>
<P>The effects of the medicines are u&s;ually the&s;e;</P>
<P>If there has been much &s;ickne&s;s at &s;tomach, a vomit|ing frequently happens &s;oon after the pill: this the pa|tients &s;hould promote by drinking plentifully of &s;ome warm diluents; and till the fatigue occa&s;ioned by it is over, they certainly ought not to go abroad.</P>
<P>By this operation, and the &s;tools which &s;ucceed, the feveri&s;h and internal heat, thir&s;t, &s;ickne&s;s and pains, are for the mo&s;t part con&s;iderably abated. The patients commonly complain of being very low and faint after
<PB N="36" REF="012028_0033_0F894374AB8F65D0">
the&s;e evacuations; but the mo&s;t urgent &s;ymptoms being alleviated thereby, a di&s;po&s;ition to receive nouri&s;hment hourly increa&s;es. They are then allowed to drink thin mutten or chicken broth, milk pottage or tea, as the mo&s;t grateful and refre&s;hing cordial &s;u&s;tenance they can take; &s;leep likewi&s;e now mo&s;t commonly comes on &s;pontaneou&s;ly. But they are only permitted to enjoy this refre&s;hment by day upon the bed, for I always di&s;|&s;uade them from going into it till night.</P>
<P>From the foregoing account it appears, that the fever preceding eruption, and the mo&s;t grievous &s;ymptoms accompanying it, may often be greatly mitigated by this practice; and I will here add, that the eruption is mo&s;t certainly retarded, that is, it does not appear &s;o &s;oon after the attack of the di&s;ea&s;e, nor come out &s;o precipitately when it has begun to appear, as it &s;eemed likely to have done if the natural progre&s;s had not been interrupted; an effect, which, however dangerous it may have been thought, may be done with the utmo&s;t &s;afety, and clearly &s;hews the utility of the practice; for it is evident from experience, that the later the eruption &s;hews it&s;elf after the beginning of the di&s;ea&s;e, and the &s;lower it comes out, the more mild and favour|able is the &s;ub&s;equent di&s;order. And I am of opinion, that the eruption is not only retarded and protracted by this method, but likewi&s;e that it is in &s;ome degree re|pre&s;&s;ed, having had &s;trong rea&s;ons to apprehend in &s;e|veral in&s;tances, that the number of pu&s;tules which ap|peared at fir&s;t, were by &s;uch repre&s;&s;ion actually dimi|ni&s;hed, and tho&s;e that remained &s;eemed larger and of a milder kind.</P>
<P>What has hitherto been &s;aid on the &s;ubject, relates only to the di&s;ea&s;e in its eruptive &s;tate, which is certain|ly a very intere&s;ting period; but that which follows, is not le&s;s &s;o, tho' not always attended to &s;o much as it de&s;erves; for when the eruption is compleated, the &s;ymptoms abate, the patients &s;eem relieved, and often to &s;uch a degree, that both they and their attendants flatter them&s;elves with hopes of a happy event, and think, it unnece&s;&s;ary to apply for any medical a&s;&s;i&s;tance;
<PB N="37" REF="012028_0034_0F8943756F339A58">
yet with all the&s;e hopeful appearances, the number and kind of the &s;mall-pox are frequently &s;uch, as would make a judicious practitioner apprehen&s;ive of much dan|ger in the &s;ub&s;equent &s;tages.</P>
<P>And where the practitioners them&s;elves may &s;ee rea|&s;on to doubt of the event, yet few or none of them have attempted, I believe, to do much towards preventing the danger; for unle&s;s &s;ome pre&s;&s;ing &s;ymptoms call for immediate relief, it is the general practice to wait till maturation comes on, and brings with it &s;uch a train of dreadful complaints, as are more than enough to em|ploy, and too often baffle the be&s;t abilities.</P>
<P>In this neglected interval, from the eruption being compleated, to the acce&s;&s;ion of the fever of maturation, and its concomitants (an interval which in point of du|ration is very different in different con&s;titutions and kinds of &s;mall-pox) I will venture in general to recom|mend the &s;ame mercurial antimonial medicine as was pre&s;cribed in the eruptive fever, to be repeated at pro|per intervals, till the maturation advances, at which time it mu&s;t certainly be di&s;continued: and the&s;e cir|cum&s;tances can be regulated only by tho&s;e who attend according to the urgency of the &s;ymptoms, and the &s;trength of the patients: A cupful of the following apozem &s;hould, if nece&s;&s;ary, be now and then taken after the mercurial medicine, often enough to procure 3 or 4 &s;tools a day, e&s;pecially if the patient is co&s;tive.</P>

<P>How far it may be &s;afe or advi&s;eable for the patients to venture out into the open air during this &s;tage of the di&s;ea&s;e, I will not yet pretend to &s;ay, but they will cer|tainly be both refre&s;hed and invigorated, by being kept out of bed as much as they can bear, without being over-fatigued; and by fre&s;h air let in &s;ometimes through an open window: as the violence of the eruptive fever with its attendant complaints mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily exhau&s;t the &s;trength and &s;pirits, both &s;hould in this interval be re|cruited, by as much proper nouri&s;hment (&s;uch as has been

mentioned in the former part of this chapter) as can be taken down without offending the &s;tomach, and al&s;o, if occa&s;ion requires, with medicines of a cordial and ano|dyne quality; for this is the time to recover as much &s;trength as po&s;&s;ible, in order to be better able to en|counter and bear the pain and fever, which will mo&s;t certainly happen, as the &s;tate of maturation advances.</P>
<P>Medicines, except what have been already mentioned, &s;eem at this time unnece&s;&s;ary, and they would interfere with and prevent the true reli&s;h for food.</P>
<P>But for the be&s;t method of treating the &s;mall-pox in its mo&s;t dangerous &s;tage, I mean that of maturation, I mu&s;t refer to the &s;everal learned and eminent practition|ers who have profe&s;&s;edly written upon the &s;ubject, who&s;e opinions and practice I neither pretend to correct or amend. I &s;hall however take the liberty to recommend one medicine to be u&s;ed in that &s;tage of the di&s;ea&s;e, which I have found to abate heat, and allay thir&s;t, in &s;uch a manner as to afford a very plea&s;ing refre&s;hment.</P>
<P>Take of the weak &s;pirit of vitriol one part, of the &s;weet &s;pirit of vitriol two parts; mix. Of this the quan|tity of half an ounce may be added to a quart, or perhaps three pints of barley water, or the pectoral drink, or any other diluent, and to be drank of at plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>I have at pre&s;ent nothing farther to recommend; but what has been &s;aid will, I pre&s;ume, be &s;ufficient with the ca&s;es annexed (in which the method will be more plainly de&s;cribed) to ju&s;tify further trials of the cooling, repel|ling and evacuating practice in the beginning at lea&s;t of the natural &s;mall-pox, till the eruption is compleated, e&s;pecially where the phy&s;ician has an opportunity of making the trial before the eruption appears, and can be pretty certain, or has good rea&s;on to conclude, that his patient's di&s;order is variolous, and the more violent the &s;ymptoms are in this &s;tage of the di&s;ea&s;e, the more we &s;hall be induced to employ the means which have been attended with &s;o much &s;ucce&s;s, in the &s;ame &s;tage of the di&s;ea&s;e after inoculation.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="012028_0036_0F894376E998FCA0">But it may be a&s;ked, if I was called to a patient in a bad confluent &s;mall-pox, and finding the eruption compleated, whether in &s;uch a ca&s;e I &s;hould venture to give and continue the u&s;e of the alterative and purgative medicine, and advi&s;e the patient to go out, if he can bear it, into the open air, in cold weather, or direct air to be let in thro' a window, even while the mercurial purge may be operating?</P>
<P>Before I give a direct an&s;wer to this que&s;tion, let me fir&s;t a&s;k the mo&s;t experienced practitioner, whether he knows any method of cure, which may in bad ca&s;es be &s;afely relied on, to avert the impending danger, and &s;ave his patients? The too well known fatality of all kinds of &s;mall-pox, very clearly proves that he does not, and that no &s;uch method has been yet di&s;covered. And if this be the ca&s;e, &s;urely, a bold, and even ha|zardous practice is very ju&s;tifiable in any &s;uch unhappy patients, who lie as it were under &s;entence of a cruel death, not to be prevented by what are called the re|gular and u&s;ual methods. But &s;till it may be urged, that no impending danger, however great, can &s;uffi|ciently ju&s;tify the trial of any hazardous experiment, unle&s;s we can have recour&s;e to rea&s;on founded on ex|perience: happy, indeed, it is, when we have the&s;e two guides before us; but when they are &s;eparated, the latter is certainly mo&s;t to be relied on, and her I have endeavoured hitherto to follow.</P>
<P>For in the practice of inoculation experience has taught me, that after as well as before the eruption, per&s;ons may &s;afely take mercurial purges, and go out during their operation (though I never advi&s;ed any to do &s;o) into the cold air, in inclement weather, without &s;uffering the lea&s;t harm or &s;ub&s;equent ill con&s;equence from it. And by this experience I was led, tho' with great caution, to try, whether the &s;ame practice might not be &s;afely employed in the cure of the natural &s;mall-pox, as well as the inoculated; nor have the trials been un&s;ucce&s;sful; for though among the patients I have treated in this manner, &s;ome had confluent &s;orts, yet were the complaints unu&s;ually moderate throughout the
<PB N="40" REF="012028_0037_0F894377A993C0C8">
whole progre&s;s of the di&s;ea&s;e, and the maturation was compleated without &s;uch trouble&s;ome and alarming &s;ymptoms and events as might be expected under any other known method of treatment, nor did any &s;econdary fever en&s;ue.</P>
<P>I would not however be under&s;tood to entertain &s;o good an opinion of this method, as to in&s;inuate that it will &s;ave all who have the bad confluent kind; too many of the&s;e are for the mo&s;t part incurable; but I am not without hopes, that it may give a chance of re|covery, hitherto untried of, to many; and even if this alterative and evacuating cour&s;e in the early part of the di&s;ea&s;e &s;hould not &s;ucceed, &s;o as to avert the approach|ing danger, I think there is great rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e that nouri&s;hment, cordials and opiates, which may be wanted in the &s;tate of maturation, will be admini&s;tered with more advantage and &s;ecurity after it, than if that me|thod had not been previou&s;ly taken.</P>
<P>It &s;eems nece&s;&s;ary however to declare, that nothing which has been &s;aid, is meant to relate to practice in the bleeding or purple &s;mall-pox; though very cold repellent methods may perhaps de&s;erve to be tried in the&s;e hitherto fatal ca&s;es, provided it can be done early; but the mercurial evacuating cour&s;e &s;eems quite im|proper.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, what has been &s;aid on the natural &s;mall-pox, mu&s;t wait the award of time and experience, the only te&s;ts of the utility of any practice; for I have lived long enough to have &s;een &s;everal in&s;tances where very ingenious and well meaning men have been greatly mi&s;taken, by relying too much on the fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ions made by a few &s;ucce&s;sful experiments.</P>

<HEAD>CONCLUSION.</HEAD>
<P>BEFORE I di&s;mi&s;s the &s;ubject, it may not be improper to give &s;ome account of the motives that induced me to adopt this method.</P>
<P>During the cour&s;e of many years practice of inocu|lating in the former u&s;ual method, I generally com|mitted to writing the mo&s;t remarkable occurrences, to have recour&s;e to. Among the&s;e, I recorded &s;ome ca&s;es, which proved that tho&s;e who had &s;uffered mo&s;t, were, in general, &s;uch as had been kept warm, and nur&s;ed with the greate&s;t tenderne&s;s and care. The&s;e facts di&s;|po&s;ed me to think favourably of a cooler manner of treating the di&s;ea&s;e, and made me attentive to the re|ports, of &s;uch a method having been practi&s;ed in &s;ome parts of this country with great &s;ucce&s;s, tho' too extra|vagant at fir&s;t to de&s;erve credit.</P>
<P>The reports however of this practice &s;till gained ground; and, upon the &s;tricte&s;t enquiry, I found they were for the mo&s;t part true, and that &s;uch who were treated in this way, pa&s;&s;ed thro' the di&s;temper in a more favourable manner, than my own patients, or tho&s;e of the mo&s;t able practitioners in the old method of inocu|lation; al&s;o, that the inoculators in this new way en|joined a &s;tricter regimen, as to diet, than I had hitherto thought nece&s;&s;ary; and that they frequently brought their uninfected patients into the pre&s;ence of tho&s;e who had the di&s;ea&s;e, and inoculated them immediately with fluid matter, taken on the point of a lancet, and by a very &s;light puncture or inci&s;ion, applying no dre&s;&s;ing or covering afterwards.</P>
<P>This way of performing the operation plea&s;ed me as far as related to the &s;lightne&s;s of the inci&s;ion, and the u&s;e of fre&s;h matter, for I had (in common with other in|oculators) &s;ometimes failed of infecting, by u&s;ing a thread that had been kept too long in a phial; but the
<PB N="42" REF="012028_0039_0F8943792A80D818">
circum&s;tance of bringing the per&s;on to be inoculated into the pre&s;ence of one who had the &s;mall-pox, &s;eemed hazardous, le&s;t there might be an accumulation of in|fection.</P>
<P>All doubts, however, were at la&s;t removed by the authenticated accounts that I received of the&s;e parti|culars, and of the good &s;ucce&s;s that attended the prac|tice; and I began to try it in January 1765; when, af|ter having directed a &s;trict regimen and &s;ome mercurial purges, I inoculated with fluid matter, proceeding with much circum&s;pection and attention; my patients being expo&s;ed to the open air in that cold &s;ea&s;on. The great advantage they received from this treatment, was &s;oon apparent, and more than &s;ufficient to encourage my con|tinuance in the practice, till repeated experiments in|duced me to think, that in&s;tead of &s;uppo&s;ing the fever in the &s;mall-pox to be the in&s;trument employed by na|ture to &s;ubdue and expel the variolous poi&s;on, we &s;hould rather con&s;ider it as her greate&s;t enemy, which, if not vigorou&s;ly re&s;trained, is apt to produce much di&s;|gu&s;t and danger; and that all &s;uch means &s;hould be u&s;ed as are mo&s;t likely to controul its violence, and extin|gui&s;h the too great fervor of the blood. Pur&s;uant to this opinion, be&s;ides keeping my patients in the open air, which I had learnt from others, I fir&s;t directed the mercurial and antimonial medicine, and the laxative cour&s;e in the eruptive &s;tate; the manner of admi|ni&s;tring which, and the &s;ucce&s;s attending, has been al|ready related.</P>
<P>It may perhaps appear &s;ingular, that bleeding has neither been once mentioned or directed in the cour&s;e of this work, tho' by general con&s;ent it is allowed to be the mo&s;t efficacious remedy in all inflammatory ca&s;es. To this I can only reply, that the regimen and medicines above pre&s;cribed commonly reduce the patient &s;o much as to render bleeding unnece&s;&s;ary. And in the natural &s;mall-pox it &s;eemed mo&s;t rea&s;onable to adhere as &s;trictly as po&s;&s;ible to tho&s;e mea&s;ures which had contributed ap|parently &s;o much towards pa&s;&s;ing &s;o ea&s;ily through in|oculation. I doubt not, however, that ca&s;es will ari&s;e
<PB N="43" REF="012028_0040_0F894379EA7CD0D8">
in which bleeding may not only be &s;afe, but extremely &s;alutary.</P>
<P>It will probably be needle&s;s to acquaint the reader, that I have di&s;clo&s;ed the whole of what I know with cer|tainty relative to this proce&s;s, the regimen, the medi|cines, the different types of the di&s;ea&s;e, the rules of progno&s;tick, and various events. And I believe, if the method now recommended is carefully pur&s;ued, it will be found to an&s;wer with a &s;ucce&s;s, at lea&s;t, equal to any yet di&s;covered. Neverthele&s;s it is rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e, that further experience may produce &s;ome im|provements; yet when it is con&s;idered how &s;hort a time is required for preparation, how few medicines are to be taken, tho&s;e medicines neither nau&s;eous in them|&s;elves, nor violent in their operation, of a kind likely to be beneficial to mo&s;t con&s;titutions, and hurtful to none, unle&s;s injudiciou&s;ly admini&s;tered; that the di&s;ea&s;e is u&s;ually &s;o mild as to require little or no confinement, the complaints of far the greater number being, that they have too little of the di&s;temper, and that the di&s;|agreeable con&s;equences which &s;ometimes happened after the former method of inoculation, are likewi&s;e by this mo&s;t commonly obviated; I do not &s;ee, that much al|teration can be even wi&s;hed for. That which appears mo&s;t likely to be made, is in &s;hortening the time of preparation; for as I have often been obliged to in|oculate without any, and have always had the &s;ame &s;uc|ce&s;s, it has inclined me to think, that much, if not the whole, of this proce&s;s may be di&s;pen&s;ed with (except in very full habits, or where other particular circum&s;tances may require it): But in all the&s;e ca&s;es, from the in&s;er|tion of the matter to the time of the eruptive com|plaints, the patients have been kept to a clo&s;e ob&s;er|vance of diet, and the u&s;e of the preparatory medi|cines proportioned as well as I could to their condi|tion: For I dur&s;t not, by way of experiment, di&s;|pen&s;e with the u&s;e of mea&s;ures that had been hitherto &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful.</P>
<P>Should it be a&s;ked then, To what particular circum|&s;tance the &s;ucce&s;s is owing? I can only an&s;wer, that,
<PB N="44" REF="012028_0041_0F89437AAA99CEB8">
although the whole proce&s;s may have &s;ome &s;hare in it, in my opinion it con&s;i&s;ts chiefly in the method of in|oculating with recent fluid matter, and in the manage|ment of the patients at the time of eruption. If the&s;e conjectures &s;hould be true, perhaps we &s;hall be found to have improved but little upon the judicious Syden|ham's cool method of treating the di&s;ea&s;e, and the old Greek woman's method of inoculating with fluid mat|ter carried warm in her &s;ervant's bo&s;om.</P>

the&s;e complaints increa&s;ed, and &s;pread up to the &s;houlder of one arm, which was very &s;tiff and numbed; that the inci&s;ion had itched &s;everal times, and his arms felt as if he had been brui&s;ed by a blow with a very large &s;tick. And on the preceding evening, which was the &s;econd from the inoculation, his head had been giddy and in pain, accompanied with &s;ome chilly fits; but all the&s;e &s;en&s;ations went off without any other illne&s;s.

<P>He returned the following day, being the 8th, in the afternoon, making no complaint but of hunger; yet &s;aid his head had aked the preceding night after his journey. His arms were now rather more inflamed, which I attributed to the friction they might have in the chai&s;e; but from this time all complaints of every kind cea&s;ed. His arms &s;oon became quite well; he took his fir&s;t purge on the following day, a &s;econd on the 11th, and returned home on the 13th from the inoculation, without having a &s;ingle eruption of any kind.</P>
<P>It is remarkable in this gentleman's ca&s;e, that bring &s;o well, he did not chu&s;e to live with tho&s;e who had the di&s;temper, but continued in a lodging with his wife, who accompanied him by way of nur&s;e, upon full con|fidence of having had the &s;mall-pox many years &s;ince.

<P>A young gentleman aged 19 was inoculated June 2d 1765.</P>
<P>On the 3d he rode out with a friend in an open chai&s;e, and it being &s;tormy weather, returned home wet. I called on him next morning, and found him in bed, complaining that he had re&s;ted ill, felt &s;hooting pains in his head, his throat a little &s;ore, thought him|&s;elf feveri&s;h, and that he had taken cold the preceding day. All this &s;eemed very probable: His pul&s;e was too quick, though the heat not con&s;iderable, and he was in a moderate &s;weat.</P>
<P>He <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">bout 10, and kept within doors the whole day, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of wearine&s;s, &s;light pain in the head and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> &s;houlders; al&s;o that the inci&s;ed parts felt unea&s;y, and itched.</P>
<P>On the 5th he thought his cold con&s;iderably better, and ventured abroad. His arm appeared certainly in|fected, and very forward; in&s;omuch that I &s;u&s;pected he would have no more illne&s;s in con&s;equence of the inoculation.</P>
<P>On the 7th the inflammation on the arm was con|&s;iderably abated, and the inci&s;ion &s;eemed di&s;po&s;ed to heal.</P>
<P>Apprehending from the&s;e circum&s;tances that nothing more was to be expected from the operation, he was inoculated again in the evening, from a per&s;on who had the di&s;temper pretty full, tho' of a di&s;tinct kind, in the natural way.</P>
<P>No marks, however, of infection en&s;ued from this la&s;t operation; and he continued vi&s;iting with me many patients in all &s;tages of the di&s;ea&s;e: So that it is pro|bable he was then in more danger of infection than he will ever be.</P>

<P>On the 20th the &s;ame kind of &s;en&s;ation in the arm remained, extending al&s;o to that &s;ide of the head, which was in &s;ome pain. The&s;e complaints continued this day and the next. I ordered him to take the &s;ame mercurial pill at going to bed.</P>

<P>In the afternoon he returned, when I found there were &s;everal pu&s;tules out, which had the appearance of being true &s;mall-pox; and his arms were as forward as is u&s;ual at the time of eruption. All his complaints were now gone off, and he &s;eemed quite well.</P>

<P>A gentlewoman turned of 50, of a corpulent habit and clear complexion, was inoculated about noon.

<P><HI>JAnuary</HI> 9th a &s;trong healthy man, aged 24, was in|oculated. The eruptive complaints began on the 8th day, ran pretty high, and on the inoculated parts of each arm he felt very great and unu&s;ual pains. On the 10th a true ery&s;ipelatous &s;welling attacked one arm, and extended from the &s;houlder to the elbow, the other was al&s;o affected in the like manner, but not &s;o con|&s;iderably. In the evening of the &s;ame day he complain|ed of great pain and &s;orene&s;s about his &s;tomach, and at this time the whole &s;urface of the &s;kin was nearly cover|ed with a ra&s;h and petechial &s;pots of differen colours and &s;izes.</P>
<P>What I di&s;tingui&s;h by the name of ra&s;h, were pim|ples much re&s;embling the confluent pocks, and ri&s;ing above the &s;kin; the petechial &s;pots were inter&s;per&s;ed, and even with the &s;kin; &s;ome of the&s;e were &s;mall like flea-bites, others were near as large as a &s;ilver penny; &s;ome were of a very dark purple, and others of a livid colour. I ob&s;erved them carefully, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by a good convex gla&s;s, and found the appearances &s;ingular and alarming.

and no great weakne&s;s attended, the event &s;eemed to be the le&s;s doubtful. The patient drank a ba&s;on of white wine whey at going to bed, and I found him pretty well in the morning; the Ery&s;ipelas began to be le&s;s fiery, and put on a darker hue; a few large di&s;tinct pu&s;tules of real &s;mall-pox &s;oon di&s;covered them&s;elves, and from this time all went on very well; the arms indeed were of a livid colour for &s;ome time, but gave the patient no pain or unea&s;ine&s;s, &s;o that he pa&s;&s;ed through the whole proce&s;s perfectly well in every other re&s;pect.</P>

On the 7th day from the inoculation &s;he be|gan to have the eruptive &s;ymptoms, which were accom|panied with more fever and pain in the head and back than is u&s;ual, al&s;o very great &s;ickne&s;s and vomiting; the&s;e were &s;ucceeded by a univer&s;al ra&s;h, of the &s;ame kind as had happened before; in this &s;ituation &s;he was ordered to keep her room, and the following medicine directed:</P>
<P>Take compound powder of crabs claws, one &s;cruple; emetic tartar, one grain.</P>
<P>This operated moderately by vomit, di&s;charging &s;ome bile, and al&s;o twice by &s;tool. The &s;tomach was much relieved, but the ra&s;h remained, and put on &s;o much the appearance of a confluent eruption, that I could &s;carce be &s;atisfied it was not &s;o, though I had &s;een in the &s;ame per&s;on but a few days before a &s;maller degree of the &s;ame ra&s;h. What made the ca&s;e more doubtful was, that the fever &s;till remained pretty high; and her head and back were not much relieved by this eruption. In this &s;ituation I did not think it advi&s;eable to expo&s;e the patient to the open air, but directed only a &s;aline mixture, with compound powder of crabs claws, and that &s;he &s;hould keep her room, but not her bed.</P>
<P>On the 10th a few di&s;tinct pu&s;tules were to be di&s;|tingui&s;hed, the ra&s;h began to look fainter, and the whole

<P>On the 12th he took a purge; his arm remained con|&s;iderably inflamed; but as he was very de&s;irous of going to a relation's hou&s;e, where he propo&s;ed to be aired, I con&s;ented to it.</P>

<P N="14">14th. He was free from all complaints, the di&s;co|louration on the arm had &s;pread wider, and two or three pu&s;tules were di&s;covered near the place of in&s;ertion.</P>
<P N="15">15th. Many pu&s;tules appeared in different parts, about one hundred.</P>
<P N="16">16th. The pu&s;tules were properly advanced, and the man &s;eemed to be perfectly well. But there were now &s;ome appearances in the arm, which I was di&s;&s;ati&s;|fied with: for the inoculated part was covered with a great number of very &s;mall pale-coloured confluent pu&s;|tules; and the inci&s;ion, in&s;tead of being elevated, was depre&s;&s;ed, and of a livid colour in the middle: this &s;ometimes happens, and denotes an e&s;char and ulcera|tion at the conclu&s;ion of the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P N="17">17th. He was &s;eized in the middle of the day with a &s;hivering fit, &s;ucceeded by great heat, and pain in the head, back and limbs, which continued all the follow|ing night. He likewi&s;e felt con&s;iderable pain at the in|ci&s;ion, and in the &s;houlder extending to the axilla.</P>

<P>This operated four times, and he was con&s;iderably re|lieved of all his complaints; but fre&s;h pu&s;tules now made their appearance on the face and other parts, to the amount of double the number at lea&s;t of the fir&s;t.

<P>June 2d.] Twenty-two per&s;ons were inoculated, who lodged in two neighbouring hou&s;es. On the 4th in the evening one of them, a man aged 30, had a &s;hivering fit, &s;ucceeded by fever, with pain in the head, back and &s;ide, which continued all night.</P>
<P N="5">5th. In the morning, when I fir&s;t vi&s;ited him, the pul&s;e was very quick, full and &s;trong, and the former com|plaints remained, but I found him walking about the hou&s;e. On in&s;pecting the inci&s;ions, both were quite well; while tho&s;e of every one of his a&s;&s;ociates, which I &s;aw at the &s;ame time, &s;hewed evident marks of infection.</P>
<P>This patient had been very much in the way of infection, and I &s;u&s;pected that he was going to have the &s;mall-pox in the natural way: I therefore directed the mercurial and antimonial pill to be taken at night, and that he &s;hould go into the air as much as he could bear, but not go into bed.</P>
<P N="6">6th. In the morning I was informed that he had been &s;ick and vomited, without having a &s;tool; and that all his complaints remained, though not quite &s;o violent. I pre|&s;cribed half an ounce of Glauber's &s;alt, and half an ounce of manna, di&s;&s;olved in water-gruel, to be taken im|mediately.</P>
<P>In the afternoon I found him in bed, but was told he had been in the air, and that the purge had operated four times. He was now di&s;po&s;ed to &s;weat, and his pains were abated; but the fever remained as before, with a white dry tongue; he had a trouble&s;ome cough, difficult re|&s;piration, and great repre&s;&s;ion at his &s;tomach, but there was not the lea&s;t &s;ign of infection in the arm.</P>

<P N="8">8th. He had four &s;tools in the night, &s;weated pretty well, and got &s;ome &s;leep; but he coughed much, breath|ed with difficulty, expectorated &s;ome thin frothy phlegm, and complained of great pain in his brea&s;t and &s;ide. Eight ounces of blood were directed to be taken away;
<PB N="58" REF="012028_0055_0F894385EA96E0B8">
the antimonial powder was repeated, with an addition of one grain of calomel; and he was directed to drink fre|quently a cupful of pectoral decoction, to a quart of which was added one ounce and a half of Minderus's &s;pirit.</P>

The inoculated parts were now di&s;coloured, &s;hewed evident &s;igns of infection, and that we &s;hould &s;oon have the &s;mall-pox to encounter, toge|ther with the peripneumonic di&s;order.</P>
<P N="10">10th. Very re&s;tle&s;s all the night, coughed much, and with great difficulty expectorated brown vi&s;cid phlegm. The bleeding was repeated, and the u&s;e of the antimonial powder and other medicines continued; which had every day procured &s;ome &s;tools, and &s;upported a con&s;tant breathing &s;weat.</P>
<P N="11">11th. The blood was &s;till found &s;izy, and the fever, cough, difficulty of re&s;piration and expectoration, were increa&s;ed. The progre&s;s of infection in the arm was &s;low, but &s;hewed, however, that the eruptive fever would &s;oon come on; and I was apprehen&s;ive that it would be &s;o confounded with the peripneumonic di&s;or|der as to cau&s;e much perplexity. I determined never|thele&s;s to attempt to relieve the latter by whatever means I could, and wait the event; and therefore ordered more blood to be taken, a bli&s;tering plai&s;ter to be applied be|tween the &s;houlders, and a &s;mall quantity of gum am|moniacum to be added to his pectoral medicines. In the evening I was informed that all the trouble&s;ome &s;ymptoms were con&s;iderably abated.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t here be noted, that all the company, who had been inoculated at the &s;ame time, were now ill, and mo&s;t of them had &s;ome eruptions.</P>

<P N="15">15th. He had re&s;ted ill, and the cough was &s;o trou|ble&s;ome, that I ordered more blood to be taken, and the medicines to be continued. The inci&s;ions this day looked like pu&s;tules irregularly &s;haped, and a fluid ap|peared under the cuticle.</P>
<P N="16">16th. All &s;ymptom<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> were more moderate; two pu&s;|tules were di&s;covered in the face, and tho&s;e at the inci|&s;ions &s;eemed tending to maturation.</P>
<P N="17">17th. All complaints much ea&s;ier; the pu&s;tules at the inci&s;ions were more elevated, and had matter in them; but the others were but little advanced, and looked pale.</P>
<P N="18">18th. He was in all re&s;pects &s;o much better, that he ventured to ride out on hor&s;eback, and I was relea&s;ed from my attendance; nor did I &s;ee him afterwards, till he called at my hou&s;e in good health on the 5th of July. But he then informed me, that in the afternoon of the 19th of June&punc; the day after I took my leave of him, he had been extremely hot and feveri&s;h; was relieved on the 20th from all feveri&s;h &s;ymptoms, and di&s;covered a great number of pu&s;tules, which ro&s;e, filled and ripened without any further illne&s;s; &s;o that he did not think it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;end me any notice of them. Looking in his face, I &s;aw about thirty marks of &s;mall-pox, which confirmed the truth of his report.</P>
<P>I have al&s;o &s;ince received a very &s;atisfactory account that many pu&s;tules in his face and other parts, which
<PB N="60" REF="012028_0057_0F89438768ABC610">

<P>A middle-aged man, on the &s;ixth day after he had been inoculated, complained of pain in his head and back, and had a &s;light degree of fever. The complaints remained till the 8th, when there appeared &s;ome erup|tions on the face, which I took to be variolous: but it is to be noted, that having lived pretty freely, his face was very red and full of pimples; and neither the prepa|ration nor medicines had much altered that appearance; &s;o that it was no ea&s;y matter to di&s;tingui&s;h between tho&s;e which were habitual to him, and the fre&s;h ones. The arm at this time was very con&s;iderably inflamed, as is u&s;ual about the time of eruption.</P>
<P>On the 9th he was perfectly well, and no more erup|tions &s;hewed them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Having had &s;everal patients, who undoubtedly pa&s;&s;ed through the di&s;temper with no more illne&s;s than this man had felt, and &s;ometimes even without any eruption, I really thought that the affair was over.</P>
<P>On the 10th he took a laxative draught, eat a piece of mutton, and drank &s;ome ale. On the afternoon of the &s;ame day I found him complaining of a pain in his head, which he thought was occa&s;ioned by his venturing abroad during the operation of the purge. He had now more fever than at any other time before; however, as he averred, that his complaints were &s;uch as he u&s;ually felt from a &s;light cold, I did not apprehend any thing more.</P>
<P>On the 11th in the morning he was &s;till much indi&s;|po&s;ed, and had re&s;ted ill. In the evening of the &s;ame day I found him much better, but he &s;aid there were more pu&s;tules on his back. The&s;e I did not &s;ee.</P>
<P>Next morning I found he was gone to a friend's hou&s;e, having left word that he was quite well, and I &s;hould hear from him, if there was occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>On the 14th I was de&s;ired to vi&s;it him, when I found a moderate number of fre&s;h pu&s;tules on the face and limbs, and in &s;uch forwardne&s;s, that I was convinced they had been <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> &s;ince his removal; which indeed
<PB N="61" REF="012028_0058_0F894389118BF950">

<HEAD>CASE XIX.</HEAD>
<P>A gentleman's &s;on in perfect health, between four and five years of age, on the third day after inoculation voided a long round worm alive, after having taken on the preceding night a do&s;e of mercurial phy&s;ic. No &s;igns of worms had hitherto been ob&s;erved in him, and he afterwards &s;eemed to be quite well, till the &s;ymptoms which u&s;ually precede the &s;mall-pox, came on.</P>
<P>After a very moderate illne&s;s, an eruption of about twenty pu&s;tules &s;ucceeded, and all complaints then cea&s;ed; &s;o that on the 4th day after the eruption, I pro|po&s;ed, and was permitted, to di&s;continue my vi&s;its for the pre&s;ent I called again however on the 6th day, and found him well as u&s;ual, and at play, the pu&s;tules being then nearly maturated.</P>
<P>I was informed, however, that in the night of the 4th day he had been hot, feveri&s;h and re&s;tle&s;s; was very well the day following, and hot again at night, but in a le&s;&s;er degree; &s;o that this &s;light illne&s;s did not then give the lea&s;t alarm. But on the 7th day early in the morning I was called up to vi&s;it him as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, and was informed, that in the beginning of the night he grew ex|tremely hot and delirious, and &s;oon became &s;tupid, drow|&s;y and &s;en&s;ele&s;s, in which condition I found him, grating his teeth, with convul&s;ive motions about the mouth.</P>
<P>The pu&s;tules were at this time quite ripe, and looked, as they always had done, extremely well. His pul&s;e was very quick, though the heat was now moderate, and the re&s;piration free and ea&s;y; but he was &s;o comato&s;e, as not to be rou&s;ed, even &s;o much as to open his eyes by any di&s;turbance that could be given.</P>
<P>In this alarming &s;ituation I de&s;ired the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the phy&s;ician, who on other occa&s;ions had u&s;ually attended the family. At our con&s;ultation, which &s;oon followed, it was agreed, that as the &s;mall-pox were very few in num|ber, had always looked well, and were now completely maturated, the pre&s;ent &s;ymptoms mu&s;t be occa&s;ioned by worms, or &s;ome irritating cau&s;e in the bowels.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="012028_0059_0F894389A959AD98">With this view a do&s;e of rhubarb and calomel was im|mediately pre&s;cribed and exhibited, though we were obliged to open the mouth by force, and this not with|out &s;ome difficulty. The operation of this medicine was accelerated by a cly&s;ter, and a large fetid &s;limy &s;tool, followed by &s;ome &s;maller liquid ones, was procured that afternoon.</P>
<P>The child, however, &s;eemed to be almo&s;t totally in|&s;en&s;ible during this time; nor did he yet appear to be in any re&s;pect relieved by the&s;e evacuations: bli&s;ters therefore were &s;ucce&s;&s;ively applied to the back, head and legs, and &s;inapi&s;ms to the feet; leeches were likewi&s;e fixed to the temples, and rhubarb with calomel, after &s;ome little interval, again directed; tin medicines being given between whiles.</P>
<P>By the&s;e means, though not till a con&s;iderable quan|tity of &s;limy and extremely offen&s;ive faeces had been di&s;|charged, &s;ome &s;igns of amendment appeared.

<HEAD>CASE XX.</HEAD>
<P>In May 1766, I was de&s;ired to vi&s;it a con&s;iderable farmer, aged 68, to give my advice for a complaint in his legs.</P>
<P>About two years before he had been &s;eized with a numbne&s;s and coldne&s;s in both legs and thighs, which it was apprehended would end in a pal&s;y. For this di&s;|order he took many medicines, and both his legs were bli&s;tered, by which he found relief; but from this time the legs were affected with trouble&s;ome itching and burn|ing pains, attended with a &s;harp &s;erous di&s;charge thro' innumerable excoriations. The&s;e complaints de&s;troyed his re&s;t, and made him unhappy.</P>
<P>After relating his ca&s;e, he told me, that, as almo&s;t every body in his neighbourhood, who had not had the &s;mall-pox, was either under inoculation, or preparing for it, he could &s;carcely expect to e&s;cape the infection, and had therefore a &s;trong de&s;ire to be inoculated, and
<PB N="63" REF="012028_0060_0F89438A698C3B00">
that his wife, of the &s;ame age with him&s;elf, was likewi&s;e de&s;irous of it.</P>
<P>This propo&s;al induced me to examine the pre&s;ent con|dition of his legs more &s;trictly. They were now, he &s;aid, in their be&s;t &s;tate; that is, not &s;o full of pain as u&s;ual; they were dry and &s;curfy. His face was likewi&s;e &s;curfy, and of a &s;ettled deep red colour; the con&s;equence, as he told me, of a repeated Ery&s;ipelas in it, and not of any intemperance.</P>
<P>Upon con&s;idering the ca&s;e, and reflecting that the pre|paratory cour&s;e of diet and medicine would probably amend the condition of his legs, I encouraged him to pur&s;ue his intention, and both he and his wife, after a fortnight's preparation, were inoculated on the 3d of June.</P>
<P>On the 9th both made &s;ome &s;light complaints; and on the 12th the wife grew better, on the appearance of a very few di&s;tinct pu&s;tules, which maturated afterwards in the mo&s;t favourable manner. But the man &s;till com|plained of pain and wearine&s;s till the 13th, when he grew ea&s;ier in that re&s;pect, and felt a &s;marting pain in his legs, which were very red, and had &s;everal pu&s;tules on them. Towards evening they grew more painful, more &s;welled, and a further eruption was di&s;cernible, though not ea&s;ily to be di&s;tingui&s;hed, by rea&s;on of their di&s;ea&s;ed &s;tate.</P>
<P>He &s;lept very little this night; but on the 14th I found him free from fever, and pretty well in all re&s;pects, ex|cept the pain in his legs: on which, and under the hams, a great number of di&s;tinct, but almo&s;t coherent pu&s;tules appeared. There were &s;everal al&s;o in the neck and face, but very few on the body or arms. He had all along been advi&s;ed not to &s;tir much, but had taken greater li|berties of walking about than I had allowed of.</P>
<P N="15">15th. He had not &s;lept a minute during the night. I found him up, and walking about the hou&s;e, complaining much of pain, but &s;aying that in other re&s;pects he was well; but he was now rather cool than warm, his pul&s;e very low, his a&s;pect languid, the colour of the face in|clined to livid and pale, and he complained of faintne&s;s and &s;ickne&s;s. I could not avoid being alarmed. The legs al&s;o were &s;welled con&s;iderably, but not inflamed.
<PB N="64" REF="012028_0061_0F89438B298CB030">
I therefore ordered him in&s;tantly to bed; and as the ten|tion was great, applied a catapla&s;m of bread and milk (being what was neare&s;t at hand) all over each leg, and directed the following medicine to be taken as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible.</P>

<P>A middle-aged woman was inoculated May 15, 1765. She began to complain on the 23d; the fever and other &s;ymptoms were very moderate. On the 26th an eruption, di&s;tinct in kind, &s;mall in number, &s;hewed it&s;elf; all the eruptive &s;ymptoms cea&s;ed, and &s;he &s;eemed perfectly well.</P>
<P>On the 29th &s;he complained that her throat was &s;ore, felt &s;tiff and &s;welled; but as this is not unu&s;ual, little regard was paid to it.</P>
<P N="30">30th. She re&s;ted ill, her throat was wor&s;e, and it now gave her great pain to &s;wallow. She had al&s;o been taken with a &s;hivering fit, &s;ucceeded by fever. On in&s;pecting the throat, I could not perceive one pu&s;tule there, but the uvula and ton&s;ils were very much &s;welled and inflamed. An acidulated gargle was directed, and a lenitive purge, which in the evening had operated thrice; the gargle had been frequently u&s;ed, but the difficulty or &s;wallowing was
<PB N="65" REF="012028_0062_0F89438BEA803408">
greatly increa&s;ed, in&s;omuch that &s;he could get nothing down; the fever too was rather increa&s;ed. Further help could not now be expected from internals; for upon making the trial, liquids returned through the no&s;e. I directed a bli&s;ter to be applied to the throat, and that &s;he &s;hould frequently gargle with warm pectoral drink.</P>
<P N="31">31&s;t. She had not &s;lept a minute, being di&s;turbed whenever &s;he attempted it, with &s;uch &s;udden &s;tartings as made her afraid to &s;leep. The feveri&s;h heat was not very great, the pul&s;e extremely quick, and all the liquids &s;he attempted to &s;wallow, &s;till came through the no&s;e. She could not lie down in bed, and therefore &s;at up in an ea&s;y chair the greate&s;t part of the night.</P>
<P>The pu&s;tules, which in the face did not exceed 20, and very few appeared el&s;ewhere, advanced to matura|tion kindly, without receiving the lea&s;t check from this adventitious illne&s;s. Her &s;peech was &s;o much affected as &s;carce to be under&s;tood. She informed me, however, that &s;he was &s;ubject to an illne&s;s of this kind, and had once narrowly e&s;caped with her life, but had never been &s;o bad before. I directed 12 ounces of blood to be taken from the arm, and that the &s;ublingual vein &s;hould be pricked. But no relief &s;eemed to be derived from any of the&s;e mea&s;ures; and upon in&s;pecting the throat again, the glands, uvula and fauces were very much in|flamed and di&s;tended. The ton&s;ils were then lanced pretty deep, and a good deal of blood being di&s;charged, the &s;welling of the parts &s;ub&s;ided, &s;o as to admit her to &s;wallow, though with difficulty, a little pectoral drink, and afterwards a few &s;poonfuls of milk pottage.</P>
<P>June 1&s;t, &s;he had re&s;ted but very little, though ex|ceeding drow&s;y, and worn out for want of &s;leep; for the &s;udden &s;tartings, upon clo&s;ing her eyes, &s;till remained, though not in &s;o great a degree as the preceding night; but &s;he had &s;wallowed &s;ome liquids, though with great difficulty. The feveri&s;h heat was not very great, the pul&s;e quick and more feeble.</P>
<P>On in&s;pecting the throat towards noon, the &s;welling, though &s;omewhat abated, was &s;till con&s;iderable enough to prevent much being &s;wallowed.</P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="012028_0063_0F89438CAA64B110">In this dangerous &s;ituation, the operation that had ad|mini&s;tered &s;ome relief, was repeated, and other parts of the ton&s;ils and fauces, which had not been wounded be|fore, were now lanced pretty deep; a large quantity of blood was di&s;charged, the parts collap&s;ed, and in le&s;s than an hour &s;he was able to &s;wallow liquids; after which &s;he got &s;ome refre&s;hing &s;leep, recovered fa&s;t, and is now in good health. The pu&s;tules, notwith&s;tanding this illne&s;s, advanced very kindly to maturation, and turned on the 7th day from the eruption.</P>

<HEAD>CASE XXII.</HEAD>
<P>A healthy middle-aged man, rather of a corpulent habit, was inoculated Feb. 9, 1767, had a &s;light cold fit (on the 5th day inclu&s;ive after the operation) which la&s;ted but a very &s;hort time, and was not &s;ucceeded by either fever or complaint of any kind.</P>
<P>His arms at that time &s;hewed certain &s;igns of the in|fection having &s;ucceeded, which continued advancing to the 9th day, when the inflammations about the inci&s;ions appeared con&s;iderably &s;pread, and were &s;urrounded with confluent clu&s;ters of very &s;mall pu&s;tules. In other re|&s;pects he was perfectly well, and felt not the lea&s;t &s;tiff|ne&s;s or pain in the axilla, or el&s;ewhere, in&s;omuch that he began to be unea&s;y le&s;t he &s;hould have no appear|ance of &s;mall-pox.</P>
<P>On the 10th &s;everal &s;mall pimples were to be &s;een on the forehead, which I &s;hould have thought &s;mall-pox, if he had not at this time been quite well, bri&s;k and hearty, without having felt any previous complaint.</P>
<P>On the 11th in the morning many more were to be &s;een on the face, limbs and body, &s;o that he might be &s;aid to be very full. I now examined him again very &s;trictly, and could not find that he had been in the lea&s;t ill; and on enquiring how he had &s;lept, he an&s;wered, never bet|ter; for he went to bed about ten, and did not wake till near &s;even in the morning: the eruption on a clo&s;e in&s;pection, had &s;uch an appearance as would have made me pronounce it the &s;mall-pox of an unfavourable kind, if it had been preceded or attended by any feveri&s;h or other complaints; but I mu&s;t confe&s;s, that even at this
<PB N="67" REF="012028_0064_0F89438D699E28D8">
time I &s;uppo&s;ed it was only an inoffen&s;ive ra&s;h, as the patient was then, and had been, entirely free from any complaint.</P>
<P>All this day he continued perfectly well, had walked out of his own accord into the fields, and in the evening a&s;&s;erted that he never had been ea&s;ier or better in all his life; though, as he confe&s;&s;ed to me afterwards, he had been in &s;ome company, where he &s;moak'd his pipe, and drank his &s;hare of a quart of ale. Still the pu&s;tules re|mained, and increa&s;ed in number, though not in &s;ize; and nothing but the con&s;ideration of his having had none of the complaints which u&s;ually precede even the &s;lighte&s;t kind of &s;mall-pox, kept me in any doubt whether they were the &s;mall-pox or not.</P>
<P>The next morning, being the 12th, the attending nur&s;e told me, that he had pa&s;&s;ed a very re&s;tle&s;s night, with much complaint of pain in his head and back; and I found him very unea&s;y, with great heat, a quick pul&s;e, and very full of a &s;mall &s;ort of &s;mall-pox, indi&s;|putably.</P>
<P>The&s;e complaints coming on at this unu&s;ual time, made me apprehen&s;ive of the con&s;equences. I gave him directly calom. gr. iij. tart. emet. gr. &frac18;, and ad|vi&s;ed him to get up and go into the air, but not to fa|tigue him&s;elf too much. I al&s;o directed, that after two hours he &s;hould take a purging draught. [It is to be ob|&s;erved, that he had had &s;tools every day regularly; and remaining perfectly well, had taken no medicine for &s;ome time.] I called on him again about two, and found him walking about the hou&s;e, when he &s;aid he was better, for that the phy&s;ick had worked him five times very &s;ufficiently, and each time he had been abroad to the privy, though it rained pretty &s;martly.</P>
<P>I &s;aw him again in the evening, and then he made but little complaint of pain in either head or back, but was almo&s;t ince&s;&s;antly teized with a &s;hort tickling cough, and complained of his throat being &s;ore. He then took another pill of the &s;ame kind as that in the morning.</P>
<P>Early the next day, the 13th, the nur&s;e informed me, that he had been very re&s;tle&s;s the whole night, had put on
<PB N="68" REF="012028_0065_0F89438E29805808">
his cloaths and came down &s;tairs, but was now gone into bed again, in hopes of getting a little re&s;t. On going into his room, I found him almo&s;t dre&s;&s;ed again, com|plaining that he had an almo&s;t con&s;tant irritation in the throat, and finding it impo&s;&s;ible to get any &s;leep, was therefore coming down &s;tairs. I enjoined him, how|ever, to keep within doors.</P>
<P>About one I &s;aw him again; he had had two &s;tools, and was better. His cough remained &s;omewhat trouble|&s;ome, and his throat grew &s;ore.</P>
<P>In the evening I found him in good &s;pirits, with a re|gular quiet pul&s;e, and he had one more purging &s;tool. I ordered another pill of the &s;ame kind to be taken at going to bed, and a ba&s;on of &s;mall white wine whey after it, al&s;o an oily mixture to be taken occa&s;ionally, to re|lieve his cough, and the tickling &s;en&s;ation in the throat.</P>
<P>The 14th in the morning he had &s;ome comfortable re&s;t, and felt him&s;elf refre&s;hed; his cough had been much bet|ter, &s;o that he had taken but once of the oily mixture. This day he had three &s;tools from his pill; and the &s;mall-pox had advanced in an unexpected kind manner.</P>
<P>From this time nothing material happened; the cough left him, and his throat gave him no trouble.</P>
<P>The pu&s;tules filled with good matter in a &s;horter time than I ever &s;aw &s;uch a number of &s;o &s;mall a &s;ort, and many were brown on the 17th day, being the 7th from the fir&s;t appearance.</P>
<P>On the 19th he took a purge, and was perfectly well.</P>
<P>To the&s;e ca&s;es many others of a &s;imilar nature might be added. But by &s;everal unfore&s;een delays, not in my power to prevent, I have been obliged to tre&s;pa&s;s &s;o much already on the patience of tho&s;e who wi&s;hed to &s;ee &s;ome account of this practice, that I &s;hall only mention a few, which by a partial or untrue relation might po&s;&s;ibly be con&s;trued to the di&s;advantage of inoculation; though, when the particular facts are candidly exhibited, every ju&s;t occa&s;ion of prejudice will undoubtedly be removed.</P>
<P>During the autumn of the la&s;t year the chin-cough was epidemick at Hertford, and as the winter approached, the &s;mall-pox al&s;o broke out in many places; and almo&s;t
<PB N="69" REF="012028_0066_0F89438EEA749B48">
every child, who before had the chin-cough, and was &s;eized with the natural &s;mall-pox, died of a confluent kind. This calamity fell &s;everely among the poor of this place, many of whom earne&s;tly intreated me to inoculate their families; but this was &s;carce po&s;&s;ible without &s;ome ne|ce&s;&s;ary provi&s;ion could be obtained <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> from the pa|ri&s;hes to which they belonged: I therefore acquainted the clergymen of the re&s;pective pari&s;hes, that if proper care was taken that nece&s;&s;aries were not wanting, I would freely inoculate and attend all &s;uch as I thought were proper &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>Both the gentlemen approved the de&s;ign; but after a &s;hort con&s;ultation with their pari&s;hioners, the affair was pu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> off, the pari&s;h-officers alledging they could not pro|vide proper places.</P>
<P>That &s;uch a de&s;ign had been in agitation, &s;oon became known, and a number of poor people were continually &s;oliciting me to inoculate them and their children at all events, promi&s;ing to provide for them&s;elves to the utmo&s;t of their power. Some had the di&s;ea&s;e already in their fa|milies. It was &s;o much in the neighbourhood of others, that they were in daily fear of taking the infection, and their di&s;tre&s;s on this occa&s;ion great. Women with chil|dren at their brea&s;ts in want of all nece&s;&s;aries, yet &s;olici|tous for the &s;afety of their offspring, pre&s;&s;ed me to ino|culate them and their children with an importunity not to be de&s;cribed. I acquainted them with the danger at|tending the infant &s;tate; but rea&s;ons availing nothing, I yielded to inoculate all who had not the chin-cough, or any other dangerous illne&s;s, though again&s;t my opinion and inclination, almo&s;t again&s;t my determined re&s;olution. Among&s;t a very great number of &s;ubjects of all ages and con&s;titutions, and where &s;ome might rea&s;onably be pre|&s;umed to have taken the infection in the natural way, I expected &s;ome di&s;agreeable events would happen, but the probability of &s;aving the lives of many prepon|derated. The following however are the only ca&s;es that border on the unfortunate, and the reader will, if &s;kil|ful and candid, ea&s;ily place them to the right account.</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="012028_0067_0F89438FAAB79F88">A mother and three children (one of them at the brea&s;t) were inoculated. The children had then the chin-cough; but this was carefully concealed from me, as I had re|fu&s;ed all under &s;uch circum&s;tances. The younge&s;t of about five months old had only five or &s;ix pu&s;tules in the face, and not more, el&s;ewhere proportionably. She lived pa&s;t the cri&s;is; but the cough remained violent, and &s;he was much enfeebled, and died as children do who pe|ri&s;h by the chin-cough, and without any one circum|&s;tance of danger that could be &s;uppo&s;ed to proceed from inoculation.</P>
<P>Another weakly child, about five months old, I had per&s;uaded the mother to wean, in order that &s;he her&s;elf might be inoculated. During the preparation this woman fell ill of a fever, as &s;uppo&s;ed; but on vi&s;iting her, I found the confluent &s;mall-pox appearing, and that the child had lain with her con&s;tantly. I was earne&s;tly &s;olicited to ino|culate this infant, in order to give it a better chance, which with great reluctance I yielded to. It had a very &s;mall number of di&s;tinct pu&s;tules, and pa&s;&s;ed through the di&s;ea&s;e &s;afely; but not being reconciled to any food but the brea&s;t, it died &s;oon after, langui&s;hing for want of pro|per &s;u&s;tenance.</P>
<P>Another unfortunate &s;ubject was al&s;o a child at the brea&s;t, one of eight children, who with the father and mo|ther were inoculated together. On the third day from the inoculation this child was &s;eized with a fever, which from the &s;ymptoms I &s;u&s;pected aro&s;e from worms. I gave it a grain of calomel; a large worm was voided the next day, and the child was &s;eemingly better; but the fever returned at night, and continued without remi&s;&s;ion in &s;uch a manner as to be very dangerous in it&s;elf, and pre|vented any di&s;tinction of the eruptive &s;ymptoms: at length a confluent kind appeared, though the number was not great; the bad &s;ymptoms were not alleviated by the eruption, and the child died early in the di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>All the&s;e ca&s;es happened &s;ince the introduction and fir&s;t chapter was wrote, and have confirmed my opinion, that it is better, both on account of the &s;ubject and the reputation of the practice, to defer inoculating children till they are about two years old.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="012028_0068_0F8943906984EFD0">It &s;eems not improper likewi&s;e to mention the fol|lowing ca&s;es; which, if the whole truth is not related, may po&s;&s;ibly afford matter of cavil again&s;t inoculation.</P>
<P>A &s;hort, thick &s;et, middle-aged man was &s;eized with the u&s;ual &s;ymptoms on the eighth day after inoculation. The eruption was favourable, the crop moderate, the pu&s;tules large and di&s;tinct, and no peculiar care was ei|ther required or ob&s;erved. The pock maturated in &s;even days; after which he took two purges, and had fixed the day for his return to London.</P>
<P>Two days before his intended journey I found him in the morning &s;itting by the fire, with his hand upon his head; upon enquiring the rea&s;on, he an&s;wered, my head feels very queer to-day: a per&s;on in company added, that he had made to free with mutton the day before; but this he denied. He did not however &s;eem much indi&s;|po&s;ed; he had taken a purge, and I expected he would be relieved by its operation.</P>
<P>Next morning he told me he had a good night's &s;leep, and was perfectly well; neverthele&s;s two hours after he fell down &s;uddenly in a fit, and &s;en&s;ele&s;s. In this con|dition I found him about &s;ix in the evening, and &s;o he continued till the night of the following day, when he expired, perfectly apoplectick, in &s;pite of every means we could attempt for his relief.</P>

<HEAD>CASE XXIII.</HEAD>
<P>ONE morning about ten I was de&s;ired to vi&s;it a poor man in a fever. Two days before, in the evening, he had been &s;eized with a &s;hivering fit, which was then &s;uppo&s;ed to be the ague; he &s;oon grew ex|tremely hot, with pain in his head, back and loins, which continued till I &s;aw him, the 24th October; he had kept his bed, had &s;carce any &s;leep, his heat great, pul&s;e &s;trong and quick, and the pain in his loins very &s;evere. This man had applied to me to be inoculated a little be|fore he was taken ill, on account of the &s;mall-pox being
<PB N="72" REF="012028_0069_0F8943912894A818">
very much in his neighbourhood; but he had not as yet taken any preparatory &s;teps. I made no doubt but he was now attacked with this di&s;ea&s;e, and from the &s;everity of the &s;ymptoms expected it would prove of the confluent kind. As he lived near me, and I could ea&s;ily attend to every circum&s;tance, I determined to try how far the cooling method might be beneficial in treating the na|tural pox.</P>
<P>I found it very difficult to per&s;uade him to ri&s;e out of bed, as he thought him&s;elf utterly unable to &s;upport him&s;elf, notwith&s;tanding he was on other occa&s;ions a re|&s;olute man. A&s;&s;uring him however, that I would not attend him, unle&s;s he would comply, he promi&s;ed to u&s;e his utmo&s;t endeavours. I left him to put this advice in practice, and ordered him to a carpenter's yard about one hundred yards di&s;tant, where I promi&s;ed to meet him.</P>
<P>In about a quarter of an hour I found he had reached the place of appointment, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a neigh|bour, and was &s;itting on a bench, complaining of great weakne&s;s, and pain in his loins; which he de&s;cribed, by &s;aying he felt as if he was cutting in two; but allowed that his head was ea&s;ier &s;ince he had been in the air. Finding that he had had a &s;tool the preceding day, but none &s;ince, I gave him a pill, containing about &s;ix grs. of calom. and 1/<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> gr. of emet. tartar, immediately; and as he complained of great thir&s;t, I permitted him to drink half a pint of cold water after it. I advi&s;ed him not to &s;it, but to endeavour to walk about a little, though ever &s;o &s;lowly; this he attempted, but went al|mo&s;t double. At this time the weather was not very cold, but there was a pretty bri&s;k wind, with &s;mall rain.</P>
<P>About a quarter of an hour after I &s;aw him again; he had re&s;olutely per&s;i&s;ted in following my directions, and &s;aid, his head was greatly relieved, but the pain in his back and loins were much the &s;ame. His pul&s;e was now much altered; in&s;tead of being full and &s;trong, as before, it was low, but quick, and the heat on the &s;kin greatly abated.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="012028_0070_0F894392D0F60698">As he &s;eemed much fatigued, I did not in&s;i&s;t on his keeping abroad longer, but permitted him to go home, de&s;iring him to refre&s;h him&s;elf, not to pull off his cloaths, or go into bed.</P>
<P>At two o'clock I &s;aw him again; his pill had then worked twice; he &s;eemed fatigued and faint, but was abroad, for he &s;aid the air refre&s;hed him, and his head was ea&s;ier in the air than within, &s;o that as &s;oon as he was a little re&s;ted, he came out by choice. The pain in his loins &s;till remained very grievous, but his head was much ea&s;ier, and his back and loins became le&s;s painful towards evening. I allowed him to go to bed about &s;even; but being de&s;irous of ob&s;erving the full effect of this kind of treatment, I ordered no medicine.</P>
<P N="25">25th. Had but little re&s;t, and his complaints nearly the &s;ame as when he went to bed. His pul&s;e was now rai&s;ed, and more full than in the evening, and the de|gree of heat greater than over night. A few &s;mall pu&s;|tules were now beginning to &s;hew them&s;elves on his face; I directed a purging draught of infu&s;ion of &s;ena and manna, quickened with jalap; advi&s;ed him to get out of bed, and venture again into the air. This he did: by two o'clock the purge had worked thrice, and he was freer from the pain in his back and loins: more pu&s;tules now appeared in the face, but &s;carce any on the limbs. He had hitherto taken nothing &s;ince his fir&s;t &s;eizure, but tea with milk, &s;age and balm tea, loathing all other nou|ri&s;hment. He per&s;i&s;ted in keeping out the greate&s;t part of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e afternoon; and at &s;even went to bed, when I found the pul&s;e more calm and regular, and as his com|plaints were le&s;s violent, he began to think of nouri&s;h|ment.</P>
<P N="26">26th. I &s;aw him at &s;even in the morning; he had &s;lept but little, had one purging &s;tool in the night, and felt him&s;elf low and languid; his pul&s;e was now even, full and regular, and his heat moderate. Many more pu&s;tules were out in the face, though but few on the limbs, and his complaints of pain in the head and back gone off. He took milk pottage with &s;ome ap|petite, and &s;pent the greate&s;t part of the day abroad.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="012028_0071_0F894393693B6798">At three in the afternoon I &s;aw him, and was told, that lying down in the bed, he had fallen a&s;leep, and waked almo&s;t choaked with blood; that he had vomit|ed up a con&s;iderable quantity, which doubtle&s;s had been &s;wallowed, as he was found bleeding at the no&s;e. From what I could learn, the whole &s;carcely exceeded &s;ix or eight ounces. He complained of faintne&s;s, and &s;aid his pains were removed. I ordered him to drink the pec|toral decoction, acidulated with a mixture of equal quantities of &s;weet and weak &s;pirit of vitriol. The number of pu&s;tules continued increa&s;ing &s;lowly on the face and other parts.</P>
<P>Late in the evening I &s;aw him again; two more pur|ging &s;tools had followed; he complained of being very faint and low, and feared he &s;hould have no re&s;t.</P>
<P>I now thought it proper to give him an anodyne cor|dial, and therefore ordered mithrid. &dram;&s;s. which he took immediately. By the help of this he pa&s;&s;ed a very re|fre&s;hing comfortable night, and thought him&s;elf quite well. The eruption was now completed; the &s;mall-pox might be properly called di&s;tinct: though full in the face, he had only a moderate number of a large &s;ort on all the other parts; and he went through the &s;ucceeding &s;tages without any difficulty.</P>

<HEAD>CASE XXIV.</HEAD>
<P>A young woman, who was &s;ervant in a hou&s;e where a child had the &s;mall-pox in the natural way, determined to &s;tay there and take her chance.</P>
<P>December 25th, 1765, I was de&s;ired to &s;ee her. She had been taken with a cold fit the preceding afternoon, which was &s;ucceeded by a fever, and the u&s;ual &s;ymp|toms attending the eruption, but in a &s;evere manner. I found her in bed, making great complaints of pain in her head, back and loins; her pul&s;e &s;trong, quick and full; a flu&s;hing red colour in the face, and the fe|ver very high.</P>
<P>With much difficulty I prevailed upon her to get up; ordered her to drink &s;ome cold water, and go abroad into the air, though it was a very fro&s;ty morning, with
<PB N="75" REF="012028_0072_0F89439429B1A138">
&s;leet. At one o'clock I called again, and found her then below &s;tairs walking about. The heat was much abated, her complexion pale, the pul&s;e &s;mall and quick, and all her complaints con&s;iderably abated.</P>
<P>The account I received from her, and the per&s;ons who attended her, was, that upon fir&s;t going into the air, &s;he was &s;o feeble, that the nur&s;e, and another to a&s;&s;i&s;t, could &s;carce &s;upport her, and it was with much difficulty, that &s;he could walk with this a&s;&s;i&s;tance; that &s;he drank a gla&s;s of cold water from the pump, and before &s;he had been abroad many minutes, found her|&s;elf much ea&s;ier, and had remained &s;o ever &s;ince. It now rained pretty hard, which had obliged her to come in; but &s;he &s;aid, if her complaints returned, &s;he would certainly go out again, be the weather ever &s;o bad, and in this re&s;olution I encouraged her.</P>
<P>On the 26th, about 11 in the morning, I vi&s;ited her again, found &s;he had pa&s;&s;ed a pretty good night, and had felt no remarkable unea&s;ine&s;s; &s;he had been abroad &s;everal times the preceding day, to which &s;he imputed the ea&s;e &s;he enjoyed. Two pu&s;tules of a di&s;tinct kind were now out in the face, and &s;he had the di&s;ea&s;e in a very favourable manner, without the lea&s;t bad &s;ymptom during the progre&s;s, or any ill con&s;equence afterwards.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="25" TYPE="case">
<HEAD>CASE XXV.</HEAD>
<P>Jan. 3d, 1766.] A healthy young man was ino|culated in company with four of his neighbours. On the &s;ixth, pre&s;uming that none of them would be ill, I went to London on bu&s;ine&s;s. Returning on the 7th in the afternoon, I was met by a &s;ervant, who informed me, that this man had been taken ill on the 5th in the afternoon, had continued very bad ever &s;ince, and now had &s;omething broke out, which was &s;u&s;pected to be the &s;mall-pox, and that I was de&s;ired to vi&s;it him im|mediately: this I complied with, and found him in bed, complaining much of pain in his head, back and loins, with great heat. Some &s;mall pu&s;tules were out in his face, which I perceived to be &s;mall-pox; this was at five in the evening, and much about forty-eight hours from the fir&s;t &s;eizure.</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="012028_0073_0F894394E98574A0">The weather was at this time exceeding cold, and it froze very hard. I ordered him out of bed immediate|ly, to drink a gla&s;s of cold water, and to get &s;ome a&s;|&s;i&s;tance, and walk abroad in the air. Upon inquiry I found he had pa&s;&s;ed without a &s;tool the whole day. Five grains of calomel in a pill were ordered to be taken immediately. He re&s;ted but little this night, and next morning a great many more pu&s;tules were out in the face, &s;ufficient to &s;hew a di&s;po&s;ition to flux. As this pill produced no manife&s;t effect, I ordered &s;al. Glaub. &dram;vi. di&s;&s;olved in water gruel, to be taken im|mediately. The vehemence of the fever and other &s;ymptoms were &s;carce moderated by this eruption.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the medicine and the &s;everity of the weather, I de&s;ired he would get on his cloths, and go into the air as much as he could po&s;&s;ibly bear, and in the evening ordered him to be carried in a chai&s;e to the hou&s;e provided for him, in ca&s;e he had been ill from inoculation. I examined the inci&s;ions carefully, but there were not the lea&s;t &s;igns of the infection having &s;ucceeded, either by di&s;colouration, hardne&s;s, or any alteration on the &s;kin, nor could he recollect that they had itched or given him the lea&s;t unea&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>In the evening he came to the hou&s;e, as ordered, but was &s;o very feeble and full of complaints, that it was with great difficulty he was got to his room. Upon inquiry I found he had vomited up the &s;alts &s;oon after taking them, and had only one co&s;tive &s;tool; he had complied with my orders about getting into the air &s;e|veral times in the day, though with great difficulty. His complaints of thir&s;t, pain in the head and back were at this time very great. I directed him to &s;it with his feet in warm water for a &s;hort time, and on going into bed to take a few &s;poonfuls of a laxative mixture, which was to be repeated till he had &s;tools.</P>
<P N="9">9th. He had been delirious in the night, but re&s;ted a little towards morning; the number of pu&s;tules was now con&s;iderably increa&s;ed. This day he had three &s;tools from his purging mixture, by which he was re|lieved, and bore &s;itting up better.</P>
<P N="10"><PB N="77" REF="012028_0074_0F894395AA5B2F78">10th. He pa&s;&s;ed the night ea&s;y, but without &s;leep. He was very full in the face, but had a &s;maller number on the body and limbs. No complaint, de&s;erving no|tice, happened during the progre&s;s to maturation. He &s;at up a part of every day to the eighth from the erup|tion, when, being blind, and very &s;ore, he kept in bed: they turned on the eleventh, and he recovered perfectly.</P>
<P>It was remarkable in this ca&s;e, that the inoculated parts never &s;hewed the lea&s;t &s;igns of infection; nor did a greater number of pu&s;tules appear near them than might have been expected, if nothing had been done; nor is there to be &s;een the lea&s;t mark where the inoculation was performed, though in all other inoculat|ed patients who have had the di&s;ea&s;e, even in the &s;light|e&s;t manner, there con&s;tantly remains a &s;car.</P>
<P>It appeared, on inquiry, that this man had been for a con&s;iderable time before in a con&s;tant inter|cour&s;e with families in the &s;mall-pox, and there &s;eems not to be the lea&s;t doubt but his was the natural di&s;ea&s;e.</P>

<P>A young woman was &s;eized with a fever, and the u&s;ual &s;ymptoms. The next day an eruption appeared, which gave &s;ome &s;u&s;picion of the &s;mall-pox: on the third day more &s;pots were di&s;covered, but &s;he was not relieved. The di&s;order was now &s;uppo&s;ed to be an inflammatory fever, attended with a ra&s;h; and as &s;he was extremely delirious, a bli&s;ter had been applied about two hours before I fir&s;t &s;aw her. The face was extremely full of very &s;mall pu&s;tules, which indeed were the &s;mall-pox, and there was a con&s;iderable num|ber on the neck and limbs; but notwith&s;tanding this eruption the fever was very high, and the degree of heat &s;o exce&s;&s;ive, that I &s;carce ever felt a per&s;on hotter; &s;he was &s;o far &s;en&s;ible as to complain of great pain in her head, &s;tomach and loins, though very delirious, and extremely re&s;tle&s;s. She was at an inn much u&s;ed by carriers, and it was highly improper &s;he &s;hould re|main

there. In her pre&s;ent &s;ituation I was &s;en&s;ible it might appear very hazardous to move her, but it was evident, that the &s;mall-pox would be confluent. I judged from the violence of the &s;ymptoms, the di&s;|ea&s;e would be dangerous, and the event doubtful, and was therefore de&s;irous of trying how far the &s;ame method and remedies which were u&s;ed &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully in the inoculated &s;mall-pox as well as in &s;ome ca&s;es of the natural di&s;ea&s;e, would avail in this. The ne|ce&s;&s;ity of removing the patient afforded me a good opportunity, without any imputation of ra&s;hne&s;s. I therefore propo&s;ed her being taken down &s;tairs into a parlour under the room where &s;he then lay, while I was pre&s;ent, and ready to a&s;&s;i&s;t, if the fatigue &s;hould be too much for her; this was con&s;ented to; the women a&s;&s;i&s;ted in getting her cloaths on, which &s;he &s;eemed much plea&s;ed with, being then delirious. She was al|together unable to &s;tand, and was therefore brought down by three per&s;ons in the &s;ame manner as if &s;he had been dead. She was then placed in a chair, but had not even &s;trength to hold her&s;elf upright, but was &s;up|ported in that po&s;ture by the women about her.</P>
<P>The fatigue of moving, and change of po&s;ture oc|ca&s;ioned a faintne&s;s, in which &s;he lo&s;t all colour, and the pu&s;tules for a time di&s;appeared; upon this the chair was leaned quite back, the bed was brought down, and laid on the floor, &s;he was placed on it with her cloaths on, and eagerly drank a gla&s;s of cold water. Her colour &s;oon returned; the pu&s;tules appeared as before; but &s;he was con&s;iderably cooled, and her pul&s;e, tho' it retained the quickne&s;s, was not near &s;o &s;trong: I &s;taid with her about half an hour, during which time &s;he was more &s;en&s;ible, not &s;o re&s;tle&s;s, but &s;eemed languid and tired. I ordered the window to be open|ed, the room to be kept cool, and gave her three grains of calomel, tart. emet. gr. 1/<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, in a pill, and directed a purging draught to be taken as &s;oon as it could be pro|cured, and as there &s;eemed no occa&s;ion for the bli&s;ter, it was taken off.</P>

<P>In the beginning of June 66, a young woman was taken with a &s;hivering fit, &s;ucceeded by a fever, and the &s;ymptoms that u&s;ually precede the &s;mall-pox, in a very violent degree; the&s;e were attended with &s;uch ge|neral weakne&s;s, that in a few hours after the &s;eizure &s;he was obliged to go to bed, where &s;he &s;oon became de|lirious, and afterward in&s;en&s;ible, her urine pa&s;&s;ing in|voluntarily. In this condition I &s;aw her fir&s;t about forty hours after &s;he was taken ill. The heat was exce&s;&s;ive, her pul&s;e extremely quick, but not &s;trong, and a few &s;mall eruptions appeared on the face, &s;ufficient to a&s;cer|tain the di&s;temper. Upon rai&s;ing her up, &s;he did not make the lea&s;t effort to &s;upport her&s;elf, and therefore was permitted to lie down, and as the room was &s;mall, the window was &s;et open.

had two &s;tools, and vomited up &s;ome bilious matter. The heat was &s;till great, the pul&s;e quick, and many &s;mall confluent pu&s;tules were out in the face and other parts; this was the third day of her illne&s;s.

<P>In the evening the eruption was increa&s;ed con&s;ider|ably in number, and &s;he was &s;o much ea&s;ier of her complaints as to bear being removed in a cart to a hou&s;e in the neighbourhood, where I gave her calomel three grains, emetic tartar one eighth of a grain.</P>
<P>She had &s;ome re&s;t this night; but the fever con|tinued, and not having had any more &s;tools, I or|dered a laxative potion of inf. of &s;ena and manna. She had three &s;tools before evening, and all her com|plaints abated. She was very full all over of a very confluent kind.</P>
<P>This young woman &s;at up the greate&s;t part of &s;e|veral days after &s;he was quite blind, by her own choice; and I do not recollect ever &s;eeing one with &s;o large a crop of pu&s;tules, who went through the di&s;ea&s;e &s;o ea&s;ily; for &s;he made no complaint but of &s;orene&s;s, nor took any medicine but a few drops of thebaic tincture at bed|time, towards the cri&s;is.</P>

<HEAD>CASE XXVIII.</HEAD>
<P>A poor man about 35 years of age, who had gone through the preparatory cour&s;e, came to my hou&s;e in company with &s;everal more, in order to be inocu|lated. As &s;oon as he came into the room, I perceived he was ill; and on enquiring he told me, that about two hours before he had been taken with a fit of the ague, and that his head, back and loins were in great pain. Feeling his pul&s;e, I found a good deal of fe|ver; his &s;kin was al&s;o very hot. I knew the &s;mall-pox was in his neighbourhood, and thence concluded, he was &s;eized with ths di&s;temper. I advi&s;ed him to keep abroad in the air as much as po&s;&s;ible, and directed
<PB N="81" REF="012028_0078_0F894398A88C8610">
a pill of the kind already mentioned at night, and a purging draught the following morning.</P>
<P>The&s;e operated four or five times, and he per&s;i&s;ted in obeying my orders; the fever and other complaints were not &s;o high as to give any great alarm; he had a pretty large number of a di&s;tinct pock, and went through the di&s;temper very well.</P>

<HEAD>CASE XXIX.</HEAD>
<P>About three in the afternoon I vi&s;ited a middle-aged man, who after two days illne&s;s had an eruption, which the neighbours &s;u&s;pected to be the &s;mall-pox; I found him in bed, very hot, and in a &s;weat; his pul&s;e quick, full and &s;trong, his face pretty full of &s;mall-pox, which had begun to appear in the morning. I received the u&s;ual account of the preceding &s;ymptoms, which had been pretty &s;evere, and he &s;till made great complaints of pains in his head, back and loins. I immediately gave him a pill, containing cal. gr. v. tart. emet. gr. &frac18;, which I had taken with me upon a pre&s;umption that I might want it. I al&s;o in&s;i&s;ted on his getting up, and going abroad into the air, notwith&s;tanding the &s;weat he was in, which it was my intention to re&s;train. I met with the u&s;ual difficulty in getting this advice com|plied with; however he was a&s;&s;i&s;ted, came down &s;tairs, and went abroad, being &s;upported by his wife; for he &s;eemed very weak, and had not been out of his bed for two days before. As he complained of great thir&s;t, I gave him a gla&s;s of cold water, and &s;tayed about half an hour to &s;ee the effect of this treatment. He was at fir&s;t very faint and &s;ick, and vomited up &s;ome bilious matter, but not the pill he had lately taken. After this, while I &s;tayed, he &s;aid his head was better, and allowed he was refre&s;hed by the air. I de&s;ired him to continue abroad as much as he could, and when he found him&s;elf tired, to go in and lie down a little; but as &s;oon as he was able, to get out again, and if thir&s;ty, to drink as much cold watet as he plea&s;ed. I then took my leave, ordering a purging draught to be
<PB N="82" REF="012028_0079_0F8943996CFD22B8">
taken as &s;oon as he received it, which I concluded would be at lea&s;t three or four hours from that time.</P>
<P>Next morning, on vi&s;iting him, I was told, that the purge had operated four times, that he found him&s;elf con&s;iderably relieved, both in his head and back, and had re&s;ted better than any time &s;ince he had been taken ill. The eruption proceeded &s;lowly; but many more pu&s;tules now appeared in his face and other parts, than before. He kept abroad, and his complaints continued wearing off. Next morning I found him quite ea&s;y; he was pretty full of a di&s;tinct pock, and from this time all went on well, without having occa&s;ion to take any more medicines.</P>
