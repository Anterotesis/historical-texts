<HEAD>AN ADDRESS, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>SO much hath been &s;aid upon the &s;ubject of Slave-Keeping, that an Apology may be required for this Addre&s;s. The only one I &s;hall offer is, that the Evil &s;till conti|nues. This may in part be owing to the great attachment we have to our own Intere&s;t, and in part, to the &s;ubject not being fully exhau&s;ted. The de&s;ign of the following addre&s;s is to &s;um up the leading arguments again&s;t it, &s;everal of which have not been urged by any of tho&s;e Authors who have written upon it.</P>
<P>Without entering into the Hi&s;tory of the facts which relate to the Slave Trade, I &s;hall proceed to combat the principal arguments which are u&s;ed to &s;upport it.</P>
<P>I need hardly &s;ay any thing in favour of the Intellects of the Negroes, or of their capaci|ties for virtue and happine&s;s, although the&s;e have been &s;uppo&s;ed, by &s;ome, to be inferior to
<PB N="2" REF="012993_0004_0F90412904BEDBE8">
tho&s;e of the inhabitants of Europe. The ac|counts which travellers give us of their ingenu|ity, humanity, and &s;trong attachment to their parents, relations, friends and country, &s;how us that they are equal to the Europeans, when we allow for the diver&s;ity of temper and geni|us which is occa&s;ioned by climate. We have many well-atte&s;ted anecdotes of as &s;ublime and di&s;intere&s;ted virtue among them as ever adorned a Roman or a Chri&s;tian character. But we are to di&s;tingui&s;h between an Afri|can in his own country, and an African in a &s;tate of &s;lavery in America. Slavery is &s;o foreign to the human mind, that the moral faculties, as well as tho&s;e of the under&s;tanding are deba&s;ed, and rendered torpid by it. All the vices which are charged upon the Negroes in the &s;outhern colonies and the We&s;t-Indies, &s;uch as Idlene&s;s, Treachery, Theft, and the like, are the genuine offspring of &s;lavery, and serve as an argument to prove that they were not intended for it.</P>
<P>Nor let it be &s;aid, in the pre&s;ent Age, that their black color (as it is commonly called) ei|ther
<PB N="3" REF="012993_0005_0F904129E179DAD0">

<Q><P>"WERE I to vindicate our right to make &s;laves of the Negroes, the&s;e &s;hould be my argu|ments.</P>
<P>The Europeans having extirpated the Americans, were obliged to make &s;laves of the Africans for clearing &s;uch va&s;t tracts of land.</P>
<P>Sugar would be too clear, if the plants which produce it were cultivated by any other than &s;laves.</P>
<P>The&s;e creatures are all over black, and with &s;uch a flat no&s;e that they can &s;carcely be pitied.</P>
<P>It is hardly to be believed that God, who is a wi&s;e be|ing, &s;hould place a &s;oul, e&s;pecially a good &s;oul, in &s;uch a black ugly body.</P>
<P>The Negroes prefer a gla&s;s necklace to that gold, which polite nations &s;o highly value: can there be a greater proof of their wanting common &s;en&s;e?</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible for us to &s;uppo&s;e the&s;e creatures to be men, becau&s;e, allowing them to be men, a &s;u&s;picion would follow, that we our&s;elves are not Chri&s;tians."</P>

The vulgar notion of their being de|&s;cended from Cain, who was &s;uppo&s;ed to have been marked with this color, is too ab&s;urd to need a refutation.&mdash;Without enquiring into the Cau&s;e of this blackne&s;s, I &s;hall only add up|on this &s;ubject, that &s;o far from being a cur&s;e, it &s;ubjects the Negroes to no inconveniencies,

<P>It has been urged by the inhabitants of the Sugar I&s;lands and South Carolina, that it would be impo&s;&s;ible to carry on the manufactories of Sugar, Rice, and Indigo, without negro &s;laves. No manufactory can ever be of con&s;equence enough to &s;ociety to admit the lea&s;t violation of the Laws of ju&s;tice or humanity. But I am far from thinking the arguments u&s;ed in favour of employing Negroes for the cultivation of the&s;e articles, &s;hould have any Weight.&mdash;M.

the king of Cochin-China, and now intendant of the i&s;les of Bourbon and Mauritius, in his ob&s;ervations upon the manners and arts of the various nations in Africa and A&s;ia, &s;peaking of the culture of &s;ugar in Cochin-China, has the following remarks.&mdash;"It is worthy ob|&s;ervation too, that the &s;ugar cane is there cul|tivated by freemen, and all the proce&s;s of pre|paration and refining, the work of free hands. Compare then the price of the Cochin-Chine&s;e production with the &s;ame commodity which is cultivated and prepared by the wretched &s;laves of our European colonies, and judge if, to procure &s;ugar from our colonies, it was ne|ce&s;&s;ary to authorize by law the &s;lavery of the unhappy Africans tran&s;ported to America. <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">White &s;ugar, of the be&s;t quality, is &s;old for three Dol|lars the Cochin-China quintal, which weighs from I50 to 200 pounds French. Ninety-one pounds eight ounces French, makes one hundred pounds Engli&s;h.</NOTE> From what I have ob&s;erved at Cochin-China, I cannot entertain a doubt, but that our We&s;t|India colonies, had they been di&s;tributed, with|out re&s;ervation among&s;t a free people, would

have produced double the quantity that is now procured from the labour of the unfortunate negroes."</P>
<P>"What advantage, then, has accrued to Eu|rope, civilized as it is, and thoroughly ver&s;|ed in the laws of nature, and the rights of mankind, by legally authorizing in our colo|nies, the daily outrages again&s;t human nature, permitting them to deba&s;e man almo&s;t below the level of the bea&s;ts of the field? The&s;e &s;la|vi&s;h laws have proved as oppo&s;ite to its intere&s;t, as they are to its honour, and to the laws of humanity. This remark I have often made."</P>
<P>"Liberty and property form the ba&s;is of abundance, and good agriculture: I never ob|&s;erved it to flouri&s;h where tho&s;e rights of man|kind were not firmly e&s;tabli&s;hed. The earth, which multiplies her productious with a kind of profu&s;ion, under the hands of the free-born labourer, &s;eems to &s;hrink into barrenne&s;s un|der the &s;weat of the &s;lave. Such is the will of the great Author of our Nature, who has cre|ated man free, and a&s;&s;igned to him the earth, that he might cultivate his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion with the
<PB N="7" REF="012993_0009_0F90412F8241AEB8" MS="y">
&s;weat of his brow; but &s;till &s;hould enjoy his Liberty." Now if the plantations in the i&s;l|ands and the &s;outhern colonies were more li|mited, and freemen only employed in working them, the general product would be greater, al|though the profits to individuals would be le&s;s,&mdash;a circum&s;tance this, which by dimini&s;hing o|pulence in a few, would &s;uppre&s;s Luxury and Vice, and promote that equal di&s;tribution of pro|perty, which appears be&s;t calculated to pro|mote the welfare of Society.&mdash;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">From this account of Le Poivre's, we may learn the futility of the argument, that the number of ve&s;&s;els in the &s;ugar trade, &s;erve as a nur&s;ery for &s;eaman, and that the Ne|groes con&s;ume a large quantity of the manufactures of Great Britain. If freemen only were employed in the i&s;lands, a double quantity of &s;ugar would be made, and of cour&s;e twice the number of ve&s;&s;els and &s;eamen would be made u&s;e of in the trade. One freeman con&s;umes u&s;ually four times the quantity of Briti&s;h goods that a Negro does. Slaves generally multiply &s;lowly. Freemen multiply in propor|tion as &s;lavery is di&s;couraged. It is to be hoped therefore that motives of policy will at last induce Britons to give up a trade, which tho&s;e of ju&s;tice and humanity cannot prevail upon them to relingui&s;h.</NOTE> I know it has been &s;aid by &s;ome, that none but the na|tives of warm climates could undergo the
<PB N="8" REF="012993_0010_0F904130A0E48458" MS="y">
`exce&s;&s;ive heat and labor of the We&s;t-India i&s;l|ands. But this argument is founded upon an error; for the rever&s;e of this is true. I have been informed by good authority, that one Eu|ropean who e&s;capes the fir&s;t or &s;econd year, will do twice the work, and live twice the num|ber of years that an ordinary Negro man will do nor need we be &s;urpriz'd at this, when we hear that &s;uch is the natural fertility of &s;oil, and &s;o numerous the &s;pontaneous fruits of the earth in the interior parts of Africa, that the natives live in plenty at the expence of little or no labor, which, in warm climates, has ever been found to be incompatible with long life and happine&s;s. Future ages, therefore, when they read the accounts of the Slave Trade (&mdash;if they do not regard them as fabulous) &mdash; will be at a lo&s;s which to condemn mo&s;t, our folly or our Guilt, in abetting this direct vio|lation of the Laws of nature and Religion.</P>

If it could be proved that no te&s;timo|ny was to be found in the Bible again&s;t a prac|tice &s;o pregnant with evils of the mo&s;t de&s;truc|tive tendency to &s;ociety, it would be &s;ufficient to overthrow its divine Original.

<P>"I AM told of &s;ome Regulations that have taken Place in the Spani&s;h Colonies, which do the Spaniards much Honor, and are certainly worthy our Imitation, in ca&s;e we &s;hould not be &s;o happy as to obtain an entire Abolition of Slavery, and probably you wou'd find many American Sub|jects that wou'd be willing to promote &s;uch Regulations, tho' the &s;ame People wou'd &s;trenou&s;ly oppo&s;e the &s;cheme of a to|tal Abolition of Slavery. I have never &s;een an Account of the Spani&s;h Regulations in writing, but I under&s;tand that they are to the following Effect: As &s;oon as a &s;lave is landed, his Name, Price, &amp;c. are regi&s;ter'd in a public Office, and the Ma&s;ter is obliged to allow him One Working Day in every Week to him&s;elf, be&s;ides Sundays, &s;o that if the Slave chu&s;es to work for his Ma&s;ter on that Day, he receives the Wages of a Freeman for it, and whatever he gains by his Labor on that Day, is &s;o &s;ecured to him by Law, that the Ma&s;ter cannot deprive him of it. This is certainly a con&s;i|derable Step towards the aboli&s;hing ab&s;olute Slavery. As &s;oon as the &s;lave is able to purcha&s;e another working Day, the ma&s;ter is obliged to &s;ell it to him at a proportionable price, viz. I-fifth Part of his original Co&s;t: and &s;o likewi&s;e the re|maining 4 Days at the &s;ame Rate, as &s;oon as the Slave is able to redeem them, after which he is ab&s;olutely free. This is &s;uch an Encouragement to Indu&s;try, that even the mo&s;t in|dolent are tempted to exert them&s;elves. Men who have thus worked out their Freedom are inured to the Labor of the Country and are certainly the mo&s;t u&s;eful Subjects that a Co|lony can acquire. Regulations might be formed upon the &s;ame Plan to encourage the Indu&s;try of Slaves that are already imported into the colonies, which would teach them how to maintain them&s;elves and be as u&s;eful, as well as le&s;s expen|&s;ive to the Planter. They would by &s;uch Means become Members of Society and have an Intere&s;t in the Welfare of the Community, which would add greatly to the Strength and Security of each Colony; whereas, at pre&s;ent, many of the Planters are in continual Danger of being cut off by their Slaves.&mdash;a Fate which, they but too ju&s;tly de&s;erve!".</P></NOTE></P>

<P>SIR HANS SLOAN (who re&s;ided many years in Jamaica) in his Introduction to the Na|tural Hi&s;tory of that I&s;land, gives the following account of the Puni&s;hments inflicted on the Negroes. "For Rebellion, the Puni&s;hment is burning them, by nailing them down on the Ground, with crooked Sticks on every Limb, and then applying the Fire by Degrees from the Feet and Hands, burning them gradually upon the Head, whereby their Pains are extra|vagant. For Crimes of a le&s;s Nature Ca&s;tra|tion or chopping off half the Foot with an Axe. For Negligence they are u&s;ually Whipp|ed by the Over&s;eers with Lance-wood Switch|es. After they are whipped 'till they are raw, &s;ome put on their Skins Pepper and Salt to make them &s;mart; at other Times their Ma&s;|ters will drop Melted Wax on their Skins, and u&s;e &s;everal very exqui&s;ite Torments."&mdash;I could here add the Te&s;timonies of many Gen|tlemen of Character who have witne&s;&s;ed Tor|tures (if po&s;&s;ible) more cruel than the&s;e, in &s;everal of the I&s;lands, and who are ready if re|quired

The different Nations of Africa are divided from each other by va&s;t tracts of uninhabited Land.

<P>THE be&s;t Definition that can be given of Man is, that he is a Creature capable of Religion. Who has not heard of the Chri&s;tian Church in Africa? If Chri&s;tianity has made le&s;s Pro|gre&s;s, and been more corrupted in this Country than in many others, it mu&s;t be a&s;cribed among other Cau&s;es to its oppo&s;ing Polygamy, a vice to which the Heat of the Climate, the early Ma|turity, and &s;peedy Decay of the Women, and the peculiar fertility of the Soil, &s;trongly di&s;po&s;|ed them.

If any of the Negroes ap|pear to be Strangers to the&s;e Virtues, it mu&s;t be a&s;cribed to their independent Mode of Life, as Savages, which exempts them from mo&s;t of tho&s;e Weakne&s;&s;es, and artificial Wants, which are introduced by civilized Life. The Savage is indebted entirely to his Bow and Fi&s;hing Rod, for his Support. The Woods and Brooks, by &s;atisfying chief of his De&s;ires, rai&s;e him above the Obligations of Friend&s;hip and Gra|titude.

<P>THREE Cau&s;es concur to check Populati|on in a Country, namely, Luxury, Debauche|ry, and Slavery.

All the&s;e pro|duce their Effects according to their Degree, or according to their being more or le&s;s com|bined. Slavery operates differently, whether it be of a political, or dome&s;tic Nature. Po|litical Slavery in &s;ome Countries has but little influence upon Population, &s;uch as in &s;ome parts of A&s;ia, and Africa.

&s;ometimes exi&s;ts under &s;uch alleviations as to have little influence upon Population. This was the ca&s;e in Egypt. The I&s;raelites multi|plied in a rapid manner during their Captivity.

Had Ma&s;ters po&s;&s;e&s;&s;|ed a right over the Lives of their Slaves, Potiphar would have avenged the di&s;honour Jo&s;eph was accu&s;ed of attempting to bring on his Bed, and not have con&s;igned him over to be tried, con|demned and puni&s;hed by the municipal Law of the Country. Slaves encrea&s;ed nearly in the &s;ame proportion as Freemen in the virtuous Ages of the Roman Empire. We read of &s;ome who owned 10,000, and others 20,000 of them.

<P>LIGON in his Account of Barbadoes tells us that in the year 1646 there were 20,000 Whites on that I&s;land, be&s;ides, to u&s;e his own Words "a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> greater number of Blacks". In the year 1676 the Negroes in Barbadoes amounted to

above one hundred thou&s;and <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Campbell's European Settlements in America.</NOTE>. Upon a Parli|amentary enquiry into the &s;tate of the African Trade in the year 1728 it appeared that in three years only the number of Negroes imported in|to Barbadoes, Jamaica, and Antigua amount|ed to 42,000, be&s;ides what were carried to St. Kitts, Nevis, and Mon&s;errat. From this it appears, that the I&s;land of Jamaica, allowing it only an equal proportion with Barbadoes and Antigua, imported 14,000 Negroes in three years. When we con&s;ider the great increa&s;e of the demand for Sugar, and the other Produce of that I&s;land, &s;ince the year 1728, we cannot ad|mit of le&s;s than 5,000 Negroes being imported there every year &s;ince.

In Barbadoes <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot"><Q>"The I&s;land of Barbadoes notwith&s;tanding all the Means they u&s;e to encrea&s;e their Negroes by Propagation, not|with&s;tanding that the Climate in every Re&s;pect, except in being more Whole&s;ome, re&s;embles the Climate from whence they came, notwith&s;tanding all this, Barbadoes lies under a Nece&s;&s;ity of an annual Recruit of five thou&s;and Slaves to keep up their Stock.

<P>"The Jaw Di&s;order, or the Tetanus of the Children, is almo&s;t always incurable. It has different Cau&s;es. The mo&s;t ordinary is the large Fires which the Negro Women have in their Huts when they lie inn. To which we may add the continual Smoke of the&s;e Fires, for their huts have no chim|nies in them to carry it off; the Children are by the&s;e means thrown into Sweats, &s;o that the lea&s;t Cold makes an impre&s;&s;ion upon their Delicate Nerves.

A Planter in one of the We&s;t-India I&s;lands who felt &s;ome unea&s;ine&s;s in his Mind from keeping Negro Slaves, wrote lately to a learned Divine in London, to know whether it was unlawful.
