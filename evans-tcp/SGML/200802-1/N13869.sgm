<P>AN army and nation &s;tanding upon the foundation of a rational and pious hope of divine aid; and united in defence of honor, innocence and ju&s;tice; &s;hould never de&s;pair of obtaining &s;ucce&s;s. For they, who&s;e principles of warfare are tru|ly benevolent and righteous, will in the end find them&s;elves triumphant over the in|ju&s;tice of tyrants, and all their minions and armed &s;laves.</P>
<P>Such con&s;iderations have often, in adver|&s;ity, con&s;oled the minds of tho&s;e advocates for the intere&s;ts of men, who e&s;teem them|&s;elves mo&s;t dignified when they are num|bered
<PB N="6" REF="017531_0004_0FA127686EF1A788">
among the true friends to their country.</P>
<P>In further introducing what I intend to perform on this au&s;picious day, let me hope to offend no one by reciting a part of tho&s;e orders which where addre&s;&s;ed to this army, and &s;eem to accord well with the &s;enti|ments ju&s;t expre&s;&s;ed. The general orders which only a &s;hort time preceded our ope|rations again&s;t the army commanded by earl Cornwallis, &s;hew a virtuous dependence on heaven and &s;ay, "We have pro&s;pects, which, UNDER THE SMILES OF HEAVEN, promi&s;e to crown our toils with the mo&s;t brilliant &s;ucce&s;s."</P>
<P>This was an honorable and public decla|ration, that the influences of Almighty power were nece&s;&s;ary in order to give us a fair pro&s;pect of victory; this was an humble invocation of the divine favor: and heaven has &s;miled upon the exertions of our com|bined forces, and "the Lord," in the &s;tile of the text, "hath helped us."</P>
<P>The &s;acred penman of the hi&s;tory of the prophet Samuel informs us, that this pi|ous and illu&s;trious per&s;on was, in a very remarkable manner, rai&s;ed up to judge and govern the Jewi&s;h nation. He was the gift of God to reward the prayers of piety, and was by his parents early devoted to the &s;ervice of God and his country.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="017531_0005_0FA12769EF1D89E8">
But before I enter fully into a di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the &s;ubject, we may take notice, that during a con&s;iderable length of time which preceded the government of Samuel, the Jewi&s;h nation had very much degenerated in their cu&s;toms and manners. Vice and iniquity &s;o abounded throughout the nation, that &s;carcely could the vi&s;ion of truth, mer|cy or ju&s;tice be perceived either among prie&s;ts or prophets, judges or people. The judgments of Heaven had collected and kindled over the heads of a people who, with very few exceptions, had for&s;ak|en their God, and united their &s;ins to draw down whole &s;tores of puni&s;hment from the very hands of mercy and goodne&s;s. Let rulers and nations know their fate when they neglect or de&s;pi&s;e their God.</P>
<P>In a word, the I&s;raelites were &s;orely op|pre&s;&s;ed by the Phili&s;tines. They had been defeated in repeated battles; their young men, and judges, and armies were &s;lain; the ark of God was taken, and "the glory had departed from I&s;rael." The hand of God was al&s;o immediately again&s;t them, to puni&s;h them for their &s;ins; and "he &s;mote of the people fifty thou&s;and and three&s;core and ten men. And the people lamented &s;ay|ing, Who is able to &s;tand before this Holy Lord God?"</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="017531_0006_0FA1276AACE7CDC8">
At this time of univer&s;al calamity, Samu|el ro&s;e up and judged the children of I&s;rael.</P>
<P>"Prepare your hearts unto the Lord," &s;aid the prophet, "and &s;erve him only: and he will deliver you out of the hand of the Phi|li&s;tines." By the prayers and interce&s;&s;ions of this man of God, and the penitent re|turning of the people unto the Lord, the aid of omnipotence was allied to their cau&s;e: "For when the Phili&s;tines drew near to battle again&s;t I&s;rael, the Lord thunder|ed with a great thunder on that day upon the Phili&s;tines, and di&s;comfited them, and they were &s;mitten before I&s;rael. And the men of I&s;rael went out of Mizpeh, and pur|&s;ued the Phili&s;tines and &s;mote them."</P>
<P>"Then Samuel took a &s;tone, and &s;et it be|tween Mizpeh and Shen, and called the name of it Ebenezer, &s;aying, Hitherto hath the Lord helped us."</P>
<P>I now beg your further attention, my dearly beloved hearers, while I attempt to illu&s;trate the meaning of the words, which I have cho&s;en for the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of your de|votions on this joyful day.</P>
<P>"Hitherto hath the Lord helped us. By the&s;e words we are called to a devout con|&s;ideration of our dependence on the Al|mighty God, and to a recollection of the many in&s;tances of help and relief with which he has conde&s;cended to ble&s;s us.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="017531_0007_0FA1276C6FC03A58">
"Then Samuel took a &s;tone, and &s;et it between Mizpeh and Shen, and called the name of it Ebenezer."</P>
<P>This was intended to manife&s;t the grate|ful &s;en&s;e they entertained of the merciful deliverance which God had granted them, and their earne&s;t de&s;ire of perpetuating their prai&s;e and gratitude to nations then unborn. This part of the &s;ubject &s;hall &s;olicit our care and attention in the &s;econd place.</P>
<P>What I have in view, as we advance in the bu&s;ine&s;s of this day, is, in the fir&s;t place, to illu&s;trate that part of the text which in|forms us, that "Hitherto hath the Lord helped us."</P>
<P>Here, perhaps, it may be a&s;ked, does this &s;ubject require any illu&s;tration before men of thought and reflection? Are not all men, it may be &s;aid, per&s;uaded by the force of rea&s;on that the &s;upreme being has &s;upported and pre&s;erved them in every &s;tage of life? But &s;hall there be many found notwith&s;tanding this per&s;ua&s;ion, who have neglected to pay their dutiful homage to the mo&s;t merciful guardian and benefac|tor of mankind? If this be &s;o, I &s;hall not do wrong, when I endeavour to make my fellow-men &s;en&s;ibly feel their dependence on the creator as well as acknowledge this truth. I will then both wi&s;h and attempt to remind them, that they can be in no &s;itua|tion
<PB N="10" REF="017531_0008_0FA1276CEE3D0558">
where the aid of the creator is not the exi&s;tence of the creature: That we may give weight to this &s;entiment, let us view man|kind when they fir&s;t awake into this world of toil and hazard. All the weakne&s;&s;es and imperfections of infancy attend them. They are, in them&s;elves con&s;idered, mo&s;t deplorably helple&s;s. The very animals of the field may, with great propriety, laugh at this feeble creature man, and boa&s;t of their &s;uperior &s;trength and independence. Nor is man helple&s;s only in this dawn of life. Even when he has reached the utmo&s;t &s;trength and wi&s;dom within the attainment of human nature; yet he mu&s;t &s;till confe&s;s that &s;afety is not derived from him&s;elf. For it will ever be found that, we can neither fore&s;ee nor overcome all the toils and dangers which await us in our pa&s;&s;age through life.</P>
<P>Every man mu&s;t therefore feel him&s;elf lonely and melancholy in this world, until he has confided in one who&s;e power can protect him, and who&s;e wi&s;dom can guide him into the plea&s;ant paths of glory and fe|licity. This &s;entiment &s;eems to be born with us and not merely the effect of teach|ing; the voice of nature and not the la|boured acqui&s;ition of philo&s;ophy. It is a truth authorized and &s;upported by the te&s;ti|mony of much the greater part of mankind
<PB N="11" REF="017531_0009_0FA1276DB015A1A0">
in all ages of the world. Were we to call for the opinion of tho&s;e nations, not ac|quainted with the knowledge of the true God, and a&s;k the religious pages of their hi&s;tories; there we &s;hould be informed that their greate&s;t &s;upport and con&s;olation amid&s;t the common or extraordinary vici&s;&s;i|tudes of life, were founded on the &s;uppo&s;ed goodne&s;s, wi&s;dom and power of tho&s;e be|ings to whom, in their unenlightened zeal, they attributed the government of the world and its numerous inhabitants. Let us a little farther follow the doctrine of our per&s;onal dependence on the &s;upreme being. We will for a moment reflect on &s;ome of the circum&s;tances of our lives, and what &s;miling pro&s;pects of human felicity have pre&s;ented them&s;elves before us. Upon recollecting their in&s;tability and painful delu&s;ion we are con&s;trained to &s;ay, that neither what immediately re&s;pects our&s;elves nor the affairs of the world are under our controul or direction. Is not every man able to &s;ay, that a thou&s;and di&s;appointments have attended him in the tran&s;actions of life, and all of them perhaps quite contrary to his mo&s;t lively hopes and expectations. What appeared perfectly ju&s;t and proper at one time, has neverthele&s;s afterwards a&s;|&s;umed a very different a&s;pect.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="017531_0010_0FA1276E6D4E8A90">
We have &s;een the be&s;t human abilities and the olde&s;t experience fall under the weightie&s;t di&s;appointment. Schemes which were in appearance well calculated to pro|duce favorable events in the concerns of life, have neverthele&s;s proved abortive.</P>
<P>Nor will it appear, upon examination, that nations or kingdoms have any &s;table foundation for their &s;upport, independent of the Sovereign Governor of the univer&s;e. All their combined wi&s;dom and &s;trength are &s;ubject to the direction of that Omni&s;cience which perfectly comprehends every tenden|cy of the councils of men. None of tho&s;e plans of operation, which are founded upon our imperfect knowledge of future events, and the &s;canty experience of pa&s;t ages, can, with any certainty, promi&s;e great &s;ucce&s;s. Of this truth the greater part of mankind have been very &s;en&s;ible; for they &s;aw &s;uch national events take place among them as were evidently of a magnitude too great to be accompli&s;hed by any human means. A conviction of this kind induced many nati|ons, which can be named, to begin all public bu&s;ine&s;s of importance with public acts of wor&s;hip. We are al&s;o a&s;&s;ured, that they never declared war, nor undertook any ha|zardous enterpri&s;e, or entered the field of battle, without imploring the aid and directi|on of &s;upernatural power. Influenced by
<PB N="13" REF="017531_0011_0FA1276F2DC19F80">
the&s;e religious &s;entiments, their generals, and officers, and &s;oldiers, have performed many things which were a&s;toni&s;hing, and much above all that could, with rea&s;on, be expected from human &s;trength and &s;agacity. In the &s;upport of this declaration, I am rich|ly furni&s;hed with the venerable authority of ancient hi&s;torians and eminent &s;tate&s;men. They teach us, that the hope of divine aid was the noble&s;t incentive to valour and re&s;o|lution in the field of war, and gained them the mo&s;t important victories. The courage of the &s;oldiers was animated by piety, and their fears di&s;pelled by a firm reliance on heaven. And both &s;acred and prophane authors inform us, that commanders of ar|mies have been attended by victory no lon|ger than they thought an alliance with hea|ven was nece&s;&s;ary. Here I think we may, with advantage, recollect the conduct and vanity of a certain Grecian general: when among his companions, and recounting the victories which were gained under his com|mand, he often a&s;cribed the &s;ucce&s;s of his army to his own good management and cou|rage, and frequently &s;aid, "and in this for|tune had no &s;hare." Afterwards he never pro&s;pered in any thing which he undertook. The &s;ame in&s;truction may be derived from the infamy and ruin of the Pharaohs, the Senacheribs and Herods of all ages. The&s;e
<PB N="14" REF="017531_0012_0FA1276FECC43480">
are the men who defy the powers of heaven and earth, and &s;eem to challenge the utmo&s;t exertions of Omnipotence. They carry with them the marks of weakne&s;s and pre|&s;umption, and are followed by ruin and confu&s;ion. On the contrary, tho&s;e nations and commanders who placed the greate&s;t confidence in Almighty God, have been mo&s;t victorious and mo&s;t flouri&s;hing. This is a truth which cannot be ju&s;tly contradict|ed; and this is a truth from which America ought to learn her happine&s;s as a nation. When a lively confidence in God &s;prings from the &s;ource of a warm and enlightened heart, and this confidence is aided by our mo&s;t &s;kilful and mo&s;t vigorous exertions, then may we entertain a well grounded hope that we &s;hall be ble&s;&s;ed with help from on high. This rational hope of divine aid will beget fortitude in danger, patience under hard&s;hips, chearfulne&s;s and plea&s;ure in pro|&s;perity, and mode&s;ty and mercy amid&s;t all the triumphs of victory. Hear what the &s;acred &s;criptures &s;ay to tho&s;e who acknowledge the providence of God; who are obedient to his commands; who confide in his goodne&s;s and power; and who humbly a&s;k his aid and direction. "Then &s;hall no man be able to &s;tand before you: for he Lord your God &s;hall lay the fear of you and the dread of you upon all the land that ye &s;hall tread upon."</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="017531_0013_0FA12770AD3EA058">
Therefore, a righteous people may encou|rage them&s;elves when they oppo&s;e their un|ju&s;t enemies; and, while they adopt the fol|lowing language of the &s;acred volume, may rejoice and &s;ay, "With them is an arm of fle&s;h; but with us is the Lord our God to help us and to fight our battles."</P>
<P>With the&s;e words I clo&s;e what I have thus far de&s;igned. They are able to &s;upport my hone&s;t exertions in the cau&s;e of ju&s;tice and religion. I a&s;k their aid, and earne&s;tly wi&s;h our minds may be ever impre&s;&s;ed with a weighty &s;en&s;e of our needed help from Almighty God.</P>
<P>In the farther di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of my &s;ubject, I will recollect &s;ome of the pa&s;t mercies which have been extended to us by our gracious God. Suffer me to &s;ay, they are &s;ufficient to inforce on our minds both a per|&s;onal and national application of the words of the text; "Hitherto hath the Lord help|ed us."</P>
<P>Who, that con&s;iders the weakne&s;s of hu|man nature, and how much it is expo&s;ed; who, that reflects on the journey of man through this world, or marks the various circum&s;tances which vi&s;ibly attend his life: I &s;ay, in the mid&s;t of the&s;e &s;ober thoughts, who does not find him&s;elf con&s;trained to give his grateful a&s;&s;ent to this declaration of one of the holy prophets: "It is of the
<PB N="16" REF="017531_0014_0FA127716F549B90">
Lord's mercies that we are not con&s;umed, becau&s;e his compa&s;&s;ions fail not.?"</P>
<P>Were it po&s;&s;ible to di&s;clo&s;e the hi&s;tories of our lives; could we rehear&s;e the hazards of infancy and childhood, and recount the toils and dangers which have kept pace with the increa&s;e of our years; or, to go yet fur|ther, were it in our power to enumerate not only the open and profe&s;&s;ed enemies of our lives and happine&s;s, but al&s;o to enter into the &s;ecret ambu&s;hments of our concealed foes, and to point out our narrow e&s;cape from evils again&s;t which we could not guard, methinks there would be very few pages in this hi&s;tory without a "Hitherto hath the Lord helped us." It is &s;aid, "In the mid&s;t of life we are in death;" and indeed death in a thou&s;and di&s;mal forms continually &s;ur|rounds us. His arrows fly thick at all times; and it can be owing only to the guardian&s;hip of heaven that they have not been aimed at us, and fa&s;tened in our vitals. Every morn|ing and evening we can only &s;ay, that we have lived, but are uncertain of the con|&s;equences of the next hour. But the&s;e are not all: how many thou&s;and precious gifts are we ble&s;&s;ed with from the hands of our bountiful benefactor? He gives us life, and all the ble&s;&s;ings of it. "In his hand is our breath, and are all our ways." Let each one of us &s;ay, then, in the inward gratitude of
<PB N="17" REF="017531_0015_0FA12772310EA7A0">
our hearts, "Ble&s;s the Lord, O my &s;oul, and forget not all his benefits. Who forgiveth all thine iniquities: who healeth all thy di&s;|ea&s;es. Who redeemeth thy life from de|&s;truction: who crowneth thee with loving kindne&s;s and tender mercies."</P>
<P>But I correct my&s;elf. I check that gene|ral zeal of gratitude which may another day be more indulged. I came not, my friends, to exhau&s;t your whole time by addre&s;&s;ing you on tho&s;e &s;ubjects of gratitude which have a common relation to the particular and per&s;onal &s;ituation of every one pre&s;ent. This employment, however plea&s;ing and ra|tional, mu&s;t &s;ubmit to claim only a future, though a more enlarged attention.</P>
<P>The voice of authority among men, calls us to diffu&s;e a general joy and gratitude through our hearts, and the hearts of the ge|nerous &s;ons of freedom. Nay, the voice of God, in his providential goodne&s;s, demands our thankful homage for a national and mo&s;t &s;ignal ble&s;&s;ing; yes, and for repeated ble&s;&s;|ings. Let us then, whether under the hea|ven's &s;pacious concave, or in the &s;acred tem|ple, let us wor&s;hip the King of heaven and earth, and adore his mercy and power, which have given us the victory over our enemies.</P>
<P>Could we give a general utterance to the united &s;tates of America; could the voice of her annals and records be heard on this glad
<PB N="18" REF="017531_0016_0FA12772EE387948">
day: or, were our pious ance&s;tors to appear before us to aid our prai&s;e and increa&s;e our devotions, they would all, with one harmo|nious voice, unite with this a&s;&s;embly in pro|claiming, that "Hitherto hath the Lord helped us."</P>
<P>Join then, friends and brethren of Ame|rica! join in heart and &s;pirit, ye patriots and friends to po&s;terity, and form one general concert of prai&s;e to HIM who has aided us! Time and hi&s;tory, who point out to the world the ways of God, ye &s;hall teach men that the Father of the oppre&s;&s;ed became the advocate of the inhabitants of this land! "He found them in a de&s;art land, and in the wa&s;te howling wilderne&s;s; he led them about, he in&s;tructed them, he kept them as the apple of his eye."</P>
<P>As a vine is planted, &s;o, O God of ho&s;ts, thy hand did e&s;tabli&s;h a people in this land. "The hills were covered with the &s;hadow of it, and the boughs there|of were like the goodly cedars. She &s;ent out her boughs unto the &s;ea, and her branches unto the river."</P>
<P>But tyranny, which raged again&s;t this people in their infancy, again prepared ca|lamity and oppre&s;&s;ion for them: and, not|with&s;tanding our enemies enjoyed the fruits of our indu&s;try and virtue, and grew great by the labour of tho&s;e they had exiled;
<PB N="19" REF="017531_0017_0FA12774FA58CC50">
yet they became envious of the happine&s;s, and jealous of the flouri&s;hing &s;tate of tho&s;e who were befriended only by their God. In the &s;pirit and &s;tyle of Egyptian tyranny, they call upon one another to unite in mea|&s;ures of cruelty and inju&s;tice. "Come on," &s;ay they, "let us deal wi&s;ely with them, le&s;t they multiply. Therefore they did &s;et over them ta&s;kma&s;ters, to afflict them with their burdens." Such was the conduct of Britain towards the inhabitants of this continent. But the Lord helped us, and their &s;ecret councils and &s;chemes, the mo&s;t wi&s;ely plan|ned, at lea&s;t in the eye of human wi&s;dom, were turned into fooli&s;hne&s;s.</P>
<P>The Lord rai&s;ed up wi&s;e and public &s;pi|rited men, able to di&s;cern our rights and privileges, and willing to defend them. The Lord rai&s;ed up warriors and &s;tate&s;men, and united their hearts and &s;trengthened their hands in the &s;ervice of their country. Our enemies were di&s;appointed; they de|&s;paired of &s;ucce&s;s, unle&s;s by their &s;uperior &s;trength and &s;kill in the field of war.</P>
<P>Mini&s;terial avarice, arrayed in rigorous acts and unju&s;t laws, &s;uddenly changed into Briti&s;h vengeance; and then ho&s;tile armies advanced to enforce &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion by the wea|pons of death and the &s;hedding of blood.</P>
<P>Then was war in the gates. Was there a &s;hield or a &s;pear &s;een among forty thou&s;and
<PB N="20" REF="017531_0018_0FA12775313C8DA0">
in America? But with joy, with prai&s;e we will &s;ay, "The battle is not to the &s;trong, nor the race to the &s;wift. My heart is to|ward tho&s;e that offered them&s;elves willingly among the people. Prai&s;e ye the Lord. O give thanks unto the Lord, for he is good. Who remembered us in our low e&s;tate: for his mercy endureth for ever."</P>
<P>Will any one blame me for hone&s;tly at|tempting to kindle the warmth of this day's gratitude into a generous and perpetual flame; a flame which, like the refiner's fire, &s;hall purify our hearts and con&s;ciences from all evil, and con&s;ume the dro&s;s of every &s;inful practice and impure affection?</P>
<P>Let, then, our gratitude be increa&s;ed, by a recollection of the unexpected and a&s;to|ni&s;hing union of the inhabitants and &s;tates of America, in oppo&s;ition to the u&s;urpation of Britain. We will call to mind &s;ome of tho&s;e gallant actions in which the a&s;&s;i&s;ting hand of heaven has appeared, and the wi&s;|dom and courage of our armies were con|&s;picuous.</P>
<P>Seven dangerous and laborious cam|paigns &s;hall aid my feeble voice. Ye well fought fields of battle, and ye joyful victo|ries, from the heights of Bo&s;ton to the plains of Georgia, ye &s;hall all con&s;pire to prove, that the Lord hath helped us.</P>
<P>Begin we then with the nineteenth of
<PB N="21" REF="017531_0019_0FA12775EDBD2EC8">
April, memorable for the fir&s;t open and bloody a&s;&s;ault on the liberties of this conti|nent. Oh! Americans, forget not to tell your children, that liberty was on that day marked for the &s;laughter, and appointed to bleed on the altars of avarice and tyranny! Oh! ye parents, tell your young offspring, as they ri&s;e under your tender and in&s;truct|ive care, tell them, they were devoted to &s;lavery! teach them what a heavy cur&s;e it is! let them know what mi&s;eries they have e&s;caped! kindle their young minds to a man|ly and generous love of freedom; but let a dignified re&s;entment again&s;t every &s;y&s;tem of &s;lavery grow with their growth, and &s;trength|en with their years. Let them hear of the cruelties of Britain; let them li&s;ten to tho&s;e narratives of war and battles, till the name of Britain and &s;lavery &s;hall make the blood thrill in their veins; let them attend to the&s;e tales of horror, until a martial &s;pirit &s;hall mingle with their blood, and glow in their faces, in an a&s;pect daring and re&s;olute as the front of the Libyan lion.</P>
<P>In the temples of that beneficent Being, who delighteth not in the mi&s;eries of man|kind, in his temples let the &s;ound of liberty be lifted up, as well as the &s;eraphic voice of religion; let them give force, and influence, and happine&s;s to each other. Let the bene|volent preacher teach his people to e&s;teem the
<PB N="22" REF="017531_0020_0FA12776AEEDC370">
ble&s;&s;ings of liberty, and to be religious and thankful; let him al&s;o require them to re|gard their freedom as one of the&s;e ble&s;&s;ings: but to con&s;ider voluntary &s;lavery as the mo&s;t dreadful cur&s;e that can be inflicted on man|kind.</P>
<P>But I return to con&s;ider what has been done between the ever memorable 19th of April, 1775, and the joyful 19th of Octo|ber, 1781.</P>
<P>Following the example of the holy &s;crip|tures, and humbly aiming at what the judges, and the prophets, and the divine poets have done, fain would I bring into view every re|markable interpo&s;ition of heaven, and, in the words of the grateful p&s;almi&s;t, clo&s;e eve|ry period of mercy and deliverance with "Prai&s;e the Lord, who hath redeemed us from our enemies: for his mercy endureth for ever."</P>
<P>Hear then, citizens and fellow &s;oldiers, what was done on Bunker's hill: that place &s;hall claim a &s;plendid page in hi&s;tory, from that time, when virtuous citizens &s;o gal|lantly oppo&s;ed Briti&s;h troops, and humbled their proud contempt of the American arms.</P>
<P>In Canada, though there the brave have fallen, have &s;unk to re&s;t, yet in the early &s;tage of this war, very important &s;ucce&s;s attended our arms: &s;trong fortre&s;&s;es and Briti&s;h troops
<PB N="23" REF="017531_0021_0FA1277770CFAE88">
were compelled to acknowledge the prowe&s;s of our forces.</P>
<P>From thence, in imagination, let us pa&s;s to our army before Bo&s;ton: there the ene|my were forced to look for &s;afety by the eva|cuation of that place.</P>
<P>That year the war was carried into the &s;tate of New York: then did our enemies ha&s;ten from the other &s;ide of the ocean to join their brethren, already engaged, to make &s;o large a portion of mankind mi&s;era|ble. Number the enemy from Britain! number them from He&s;&s;e! number their &s;hips of war! De&s;cribe, if you can, all the awful engines of death and carnage! At this time, Oh, my brethren! who taught you to hope that you could be free and independ|ent? who pre&s;erved you from falling at the feet of Britain?</P>
<P>But &s;ee the waters, though not, "like the Red &s;ea," divided into parts, yet favourable to us in a time of di&s;tre&s;s and danger. The very winds in the hand of God granted their aid to &s;ave our army. That night which bro't our troops from Long i&s;land to New York, &s;hall be foremo&s;t in giving an example of the mo&s;t intere&s;ting and fini&s;hed retreat from the mo&s;t imminent military ruin.</P>
<P>That year Clinton and Parker felt the weight of American bravery; and being de|feated and mi&s;erably &s;hattered, were obliged
<PB N="24" REF="017531_0022_0FA127782F190D78">
to relinqui&s;h their &s;outhern expedition. This campaign wore away, and &s;aw no extraordi|nary &s;ucce&s;s attend the numerous forces and the powerful fleet of the enemy; unle&s;s to murder a garri&s;on of brave men after they had capitulated, may be called extraordinary &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>Oh! ye fir&s;t fruits of American fortitude and per&s;everance, let me, in imagination, drop the tear of love and compa&s;&s;ion over your honourable graves, if your iron hearted enemies gave you any! Ye martyrs for the cau&s;e of freedom, who&s;e &s;teady &s;ouls could never bend even to a partial and momentary de&s;ertion of your principles of virtue, nei|ther the fair promi&s;es of your enemies were able to allure you, nor the unutterable hor|rors of the mo&s;t execrable pri&s;ons and cruel|ties; not death in his &s;low and gha&s;tly ap|proaches; not the lingering death of hun|ger and torture could terrify you from your fixed attachment to your country! Oh! were it con&s;i&s;tent with the will of heaven, I would &s;ay, ari&s;e, and come from the dead, to behold a large army of your enemies con|quered! ari&s;e, and animate your country|men to fini&s;h the glorious work of liberty! ari&s;e, and lead on your brother &s;oldiers to dreadful deeds of death and &s;laughter, until the ruthle&s;s hand of Britain &s;hall no more di&s;turb the peace of men.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="017531_0023_0FA12778EE45FA50">
We will now pa&s;s on to a view of the A|merican army. It was almo&s;t di&s;banded; it was reduced to a &s;mall number, and better fitted to draw forth pity and compa&s;&s;ion from the beholders, than to &s;trike them with terror; more able to &s;how their fortitude in adver&s;ity, than to do execution with their arms! Why, O Cornwallis, did&s;t thou not &s;eize the feeble warriors, and their per&s;e|vering commander? Then who can &s;ay thy pre&s;ent fate would not have been &s;u&s;pended?</P>
<P>Next go with me, I be&s;eech you, thro' one of the &s;torms and tempe&s;ts of nature. Follow the march of a few naked men, or if they were clothed it was only with rags, expo&s;ed to the rigors of December's cold. O liberty! by what charm, or what mag|netic power, did&s;t thou hold the&s;e &s;uffering men firm in thy intere&s;t? But follow them to the capture of a large body of He&s;&s;ians at Trenton. From thence pa&s;s on with the troops to Princeton; and in your way learn the re&s;ources and &s;tratagems of war, and hear of the di&s;appointment and confu|&s;ion of the enemy. Princeton, that once peaceful abode of the mu&s;es, and &s;eat of &s;cience, then heard unu&s;ual thunders, and &s;aw Britons defeated and &s;lain. Then the dying lamp of liberty was kindled anew! Thou&s;ands of heroes flew to the &s;tandards
<PB N="26" REF="017531_0024_0FA12779AE93FEF8">
of freedom, and thought &s;he could be &s;till defended.</P>
<P>An American army again took the field, and the enemy found they had the war to begin anew.</P>
<P>Near the clo&s;e of this year, the Almigh|ty, "who had not given us as a prey to their teeth," remarkably helped us, and gave Burgoyne and all his army into the hands of the United States.</P>
<P>Let a recollection of the mercies of the next year begin with a declaration of the alliance of America with the magnanimous Lewis XVI. The illu&s;trious hero, and friend to the rights of mankind, heard the fame of our cau&s;e, and joined the intere&s;t of his kingdom to the &s;upport of our inde|pendence, and has &s;pared neither blood nor wealth to e&s;tabli&s;h us in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of our freedom.</P>
<P>From this &s;ubject, let the operations of our army, numerous and gallant, demand our attention. Con&s;ider their formidable movements to the fields of Monmouth. There, my fellow &s;oldiers, you remember the fortune of the day was torn from the hands of the victorious enemy, and the flower of their army. Methinks I &s;hall not do ami&s;s, by leaving you to apply the words, of the poet, where they were de&s;erved on that day:</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="017531_0025_0FA1277BC4D55DA0">
"To fainting &s;quadrons &s;ent the timely aid, In&s;pir'd repuls'd battalions to engage, And taught the doubtful battle where to rage."</P>
<P>From the battle of Monmouth, and the various operations of the army within the fourth year of this war, we pa&s;s on to the &s;ucceeding campaign. No &s;mall &s;ucce&s;s fa|voured our arms that year. Paulus-Hook and Stoney-Point taught our enemies that their &s;trong fortre&s;&s;es were not impregna|ble to the intrepid re&s;olution and the impe|tuous a&s;&s;aults of the American forces. In the &s;ame year an important expedition was directed again&s;t the five nations of ho&s;tile indians. That expedition, though attend|ed with immen&s;e toil and difficulty, and rendered exceedingly precarious by a great number of hazardous circum&s;tances, a few of which, in their operations, could have de&s;troyed the troops on that &s;ervice: That expedition was not without &s;ucce&s;s; and what men could perform, was done.</P>
<P>But I ha&s;ten to the &s;ixth campaign, and remind you of what happened on the 25th of September in the year pa&s;t. That day &s;hould have a place in the calendars of all ages, to inform mankind what human na|ture can attempt. Then were di&s;clo&s;ed, as it were, the &s;ecret plots of hell; and trea|&s;on
<PB N="28" REF="017531_0026_0FA1277C10685910">
too big to be any longer confined, bur&s;t from its concealment. Let that day be numbered among the days of mercy; let it con&s;titute an annual fe&s;tival of grateful joy; and let liberty and the glad angels of America, hover round the a&s;&s;embled &s;ons of freedom, and in&s;pire them with a love of vir|tue and honor, and a la&s;ting remembrance of the goodne&s;s of God, who with &s;carcely any human means, and by very little human &s;aga|city, di&s;covered trea&s;onable plots when they were upon the very point of execution. Then did the Almighty &s;ave the commander of our armies, and the mo&s;t important fort|re&s;s and a part of our troops, from the very jaws of trea&s;on and our enemies. On this &s;ubject, I know you will anticipate me, and think &s;ooner than I can &s;ay, "Hitherto hath the Lord helped us." How wonderful and my&s;terious the ju&s;t and merciful ways of heaven." We have been &s;uffered to &s;tand upon the very precipice of ruin, before we were delivered from our danger. This, we ought to believe, was mercifully intended to teach us our dependence upon him, who alone can make a nation flouri&s;h; this was to make us grateful, that we might be happy. But how many &s;ubjects of grati|tude have I omitted! How many which I cannot bring into view on this day! The grateful heart will recollect more than I
<PB N="29" REF="017531_0027_0FA1277CAD9EB218">
can utter. How various have been the con|flicts between us and the enemy, &s;uperior to us in &s;trength or numbers in almo&s;t eve|ry in&s;tance? But though in various places &s;ucce&s;s has not attended us; yet the con|que&s;ts of the enemy have been few, and of &s;hort duration. Nay, the very victories they have boa&s;ted of, only ha&s;tened their ruin. For the confirmation of this truth, let us bring examples from the &s;outhern part of the continent. We will admire the enterprizing and per&s;evering &s;pirit of our &s;outhern army, who in the mid&s;t of the enemy's victories have de&s;troyed their ar|my. North and South Carolina &s;hall pro|claim the military &s;agacity and intrepidity of general Green, and his faithful band of worthies. Tho&s;e &s;tates &s;hall repeat the vic|tories which have been gained by that army; they &s;hall remember how many fortre&s;&s;es have been wre&s;ted out of the hands of an in&s;ulting enemy, vainly elated with their vi&s;ionary &s;ucce&s;s. The late important vic|tory obtained by the troops under the com|mand of general Green, &s;hall aid the joy and prai&s;e of this day, and increa&s;e our gratitude.</P>
<P>But here let me pau&s;e a moment. Per|haps upon reflection I may find rea&s;on to &s;ay, that I have aimed at more than can be performed in the &s;hort time that is allotted
<PB N="30" REF="017531_0028_0FA1277D6EBC7270">
to the public wor&s;hip of this day. Pardon me then, my dearly beloved brethren, if I have detained you too long from what ap|pears to be the more immediate intention of this a&s;&s;embly. I imagined my text meant more than to acknowledge only one victory, or one in&s;tance of the goodne&s;s of God, however great the ble&s;&s;ing might be. When our hearts are truly grateful, they are al&s;o ge|nerous and enlarged. We wi&s;h to know how much heaven has be&s;towed upon us, and how much the debts of gratitude are accumulat|ed; and even when we find that the com|putation will ri&s;e infinitely above our abili|ties to make any equal compen&s;ation; and that every new mercy will render us more eternally in&s;olvent; yet &s;till the grateful &s;oul is mo&s;t delighted, when the contem|plation of the mercy and goodne&s;s of God is mo&s;t exten&s;ive; and mu&s;t, after all we can &s;ay or do, end with this pathetic and thankful enquiry, which it will not be ea&s;y to an&s;wer, "What &s;hall I render unto the Lord, for all his benefits towards me?"</P>
<P>This &s;hall prepare our hearts for a new &s;ubject of gratitude. We will now enter upon the plea&s;ing employment of impre&s;|&s;ing our minds with a plea&s;ing remembrance of the la&s;t national ble&s;&s;ing, which heaven has vouch&s;afed unto us.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="017531_0029_0FA1277E2F992288">
Shall I not venture to &s;ay, that no ex|pedition which depended, in the fir&s;t plan of it, upon forces &s;o much disjoined, and events &s;o precarious, was ever ble&s;&s;ed with a more &s;ea&s;onable and harmonious junction of pro&s;perous circum&s;tances, or ended with more &s;ub&s;tantial glory and complete &s;uc|ce&s;s. The fir&s;t tran&s;ient view of that expe|dition &s;eems to impo&s;e upon us the pre|&s;umptuous notion of having in our hands the command of the winds and the waves, the rains and the tempe&s;ts, any of which, under the orders of heaven, would have rendered our plans of operation altogether ineffectual.</P>
<P>O Clinton! did your tory &s;pies, tho&s;e evil geniu&s;es of America, who are employ|ed in "going to and fro in the earth, &s;eek|ing whom they may devour;" did they fail to announce to you the early de&s;tination of the combined army? Alas! was there no friend to Britain able to inform Corn|wallis of his approaching danger? To us this is a happy con&s;ideration, it is a mark of military &s;kill. Secre&s;y! thou life and &s;oul of every warlike enterpri&s;e, ever deign to envelop the de&s;igns of our army in a cloud, which, as of old, &s;hall be darkne&s;s to the enemy, but, like a pillar of fire, &s;hall give light to the children of America.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="017531_0030_0FA1277EEDFC1070">
But I come to ob&s;erve, that from the time our army was ordered on the expedi|tion into Virginia, until the day on which the enemy &s;urrendered, &s;carcely any cir|cum&s;tances attended the allied forces which could be deemed unfavourable. The cheer|fulne&s;s and patience of the troops under the fatigue of long and rapid marches; the &s;pirit of enterpri&s;e; the willingne&s;s to en|dure labours and hard&s;hips of every kind, in order to promote the &s;ervice of this country, and &s;ubdue the enemy; the&s;e were all favourable omens, and are worthy of our attention and regard. The critical and &s;ea&s;onable arrival of the fleet under the command of his excellency the count de Gra&s;&s;e; and this before the enemy entered the Che&s;apeak, and by their prior po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the bay made the junction of our army and the French fleet very difficult, if not altogether impracticable. But the &s;ituation of the fleet under count de Barras, yet at &s;ea, was very critical and dangerous. The enemy appeared at the entrance of the Che&s;apeak to intercept his arrival. This was the time for the count de Gra&s;&s;e to di&s;play his abili|ties, and to prove how much can be done by a &s;ea&s;onable, well directed, and impetu|ous attack. By a mo&s;t gallant manoeuvre, he defeated the enemy, de&s;troyed &s;ome of their men of war, and drove the re&s;t in
<PB N="33" REF="017531_0031_0FA1277FAE8E80B8">
flight far to &s;ea. By this happy victory, a junction of the two French fleets was ac|compli&s;hed, and under the divine au&s;pi|ces, future &s;ucce&s;s was in&s;ured to our united forces.</P>
<P>I will next &s;peak of that harmony, that emulation, and that equal love of danger which &s;ub&s;i&s;ted among the allied troops; as if the &s;ame generous fire of true glory glowed in their bo&s;oms, or one patriot &s;oul animated them to the cheerful performance of every military duty, and to encounter every danger. Witne&s;s the emulation of tho&s;e French and American troops, who at the &s;ame time entered the trenches of the enemy, and with equal intrepidity and vi|gour of attack, &s;tormed &s;ome of their re|doubts.</P>
<P>That only a few of our troops have fal|len in the reduction of the enemy, is a plea&s;|ing con&s;ideration, and &s;hould contribute to make us thankful. The favourablene&s;s of the &s;ea&s;on &s;hall be remembered, and&mdash;But &s;hort be my narration of this glorious victory, for &s;hort were the operations of the &s;iege. A &s;trong and numerous army of our enemy have &s;urrendered them&s;elves pri&s;on|ers of war: and this &s;ignal in&s;tance of the goodne&s;s of divine providence, demands a repetition of tho&s;e words which you have
<PB N="34" REF="017531_0032_0FA1278179FA29C0">
already often heard; "Hitherto hath the Lord helped us."</P>
<P>O Virginia! highly favoured of the Lord, rejoice and be glad, for the &s;poiler is taken captive! Turn your fears and la|mentations into grateful &s;ongs of prai&s;e, and forget not to love and adore that Almighty Being who &s;ays to the rage and cruelty of men, "Hitherto &s;halt thou go, and no farther."</P>
<P>O! all ye inhabitants of the united &s;tates, let your thankfulne&s;s appear by the piety of your hearts, and the purity of your lives. Every new in&s;tance of the goodne&s;s of the Creator, calls upon us to give new &s;igns of our love and obedience to him. We &s;hould endeavour to &s;hew our&s;elves as worthy of the mercies of God, as human nature is capable, by being more virtuous, more dutiful, and more benevolent.</P>
<P>What will all the mo&s;t pompous appear|ances of gratitude avail, if the manners and cu&s;toms of our country are not pure; or the vices not reformed? Believe it, my friends, a &s;inful people cannot be a grate|ful people! For be a&s;&s;ured that a people who cannot be moved by the mercy, and goodne&s;s of God to do what is their duty, and to examine by what means they may plea&s;e their Maker and bountiful Benefactor, are truly unworthy of his mercy and protection:
<PB N="35" REF="017531_0033_0FA12781F05DE5A0">
Nay, every part of their conduct which is vicious, &s;eems very loudly to declare, that they are weary of the very goodne&s;s of God, and all the ble&s;&s;ings of heaven.</P>
<P>Having now fini&s;hed what I propo&s;ed in the fir&s;t grand divi&s;ion of my di&s;cour&s;e, I proceed to what I &s;aid &s;hould &s;olicit our at|tention in the &s;econd place.</P>
<P>"Then Samuel took a &s;tone, and &s;et it between Mizpeh and Shen." I have al|ready hinted, that by this monumental &s;tone, the children of I&s;rael intended, not only to expre&s;s their pre&s;ent gratitude, for favours conferred upon them by divine pro|vidence, but al&s;o to perpetuate the remem|brance of a very extraordinary mercy, to nations long after to be born. That this was the manner of perpetuating the me|mory of &s;ignal &s;ucce&s;s, or extraordinary events, is made evident by the te&s;timony of every ancient hi&s;torian, whether &s;acred or prophane. This cu&s;tom, however, has not been altogether confined to the ancients. Many are the pillars and monuments which &s;tand, this day, as witne&s;&s;es of great &s;ucce&s;s or of illu&s;trious merit: and America is not without her monuments of great and wor|thy men, who have generou&s;ly &s;hed their blood in the defence of their country. I therefore think it not difficult to &s;hew that public and la&s;ting &s;igns of prai&s;e to God,
<PB N="36" REF="017531_0034_0FA12782AFB6D418">
as well as marks of re&s;pect for worthy men, have been authori&s;ed by the examples of all nations. Let then the enemy to religi|on; let the enemy to his country; nay, let the vicious infidel, and the debauched libertine, let them all cea&s;e to &s;tigmati&s;e public and devout homage to almighty God with the name of unnece&s;&s;ary and unprofi|table parade. If they will neither hear the voice of rea&s;on, nor hearken to the &s;ub|lime and charming in&s;tructions of the in|&s;pired writings; let them, however, be taught &s;ome reverence for the Deity even from the cu&s;toms of heathens and pagans, where nature &s;poke, in part, what nature's God hath &s;hewed to all his rational crea|tures. Let them a&s;k what meant tho&s;e co&s;t|ly &s;acrifices of whole hecatombs; what meant tho&s;e large and expen&s;ive libations; and what meant tho&s;e &s;olemn proce&s;&s;ions to the temples of devotion? Were not all the&s;e things expre&s;&s;ions of gratitude for the mercies they had received? However, not to &s;ay all that can be offered, on this &s;ubject, from the cu&s;toms of poli&s;hed nations; I can de|rive examples of this mo&s;t rational duty, from the very original inhabitants of this continent. I can avail my&s;elf of their cu&s;|toms to plead for tho&s;e &s;igns and expre&s;&s;i|ons of gratitude, which are due to the Al|mighty Di&s;po&s;er of all events.</P>

But we may be more happy than they, we are more enlightened in the knowledge and &s;ervice of the ble&s;&s;ed and good God. Our gratitude &s;hould be more pure and more &s;piritual than theirs.

In&s;tead then of erecting al|tars, as of old was done, for offerings to a&s;cend in co&s;tly incen&s;e, to repre&s;ent our gratitude and prai&s;e; let pure and virtuous hearts be the altars, and love and obedience be the incen&s;e, which &s;hall better plea&s;e the Deity.

one humble and grateful offering, and let it be laid on the public altar of our united and open acknowledgement of the goodne&s;s of HIM who hath helped us! In the language of the P&s;almi&s;t, I will &s;ay, "Ble&s;s the Lord, O my &s;oul; and all that is within me, ble&s;s his holy name, and forget not all his bene|fits." O ju&s;t and ble&s;&s;ed God, has it plea&s;|ed thee to check the &s;word of the de&s;troy|er; yes, and in a great mea&s;ure to wre&s;t it out of the hands of the oppre&s;&s;or and the tyrant! Methinks if men uttered no &s;ongs of prai&s;e to their deliverer, this continent it&s;elf would reprove their ingratitude; it would break its long &s;ilence, and become vocal in high &s;ounding &s;ongs of prai&s;e! But our gratitude &s;hall ri&s;e high! high as the mercy &s;eat of heaven! O for glowing words! words from warm and glowing hearts! for words from lukewarm hearts can never a&s;cend to heaven! Incen&s;e mu&s;t be inflamed before it can ri&s;e to the &s;kies! On this day, the enthu&s;ia&s;m of the grateful heart is pardonable, and a pa&s;&s;ion of prai&s;e may not be di&s;plea&s;ing to that all-wi&s;e and merciful Being, who is acquainted with the upright intentions of the heart.</P>
<P>Great are our ble&s;&s;ings, and many and public &s;hould be our acknowledgements of them. This I am ju&s;tified in &s;aying, not only by our own &s;entiments; but al&s;o by

the voice of that venerable body of men, who have <HI>Recommended to the &s;everal &s;tates to &s;et apart</HI> this day <HI>to be religiou&s;ly ob&s;erv|ed as a day of</HI> THANKSGIVING <HI>and</HI> PRAY|ER. This well corre&s;ponds with the con|duct of Samuel and the elders of I&s;rael. Samuel &s;u&s;taining a public character, and being at the head of the elders and people, called their attention to acts of religious wor&s;hip, and in the &s;ight of all I&s;rael rai&s;ed a monument of prai&s;e to almighty God. "And after this, the hand of the Lord was again&s;t the Phili&s;tines all the days of Sa|muel."</P>
<P>How dignified and venerable do great men appear, when they acknowledge the Supreme Being as the author of all their wi&s;dom, greatne&s;s, and &s;ucce&s;s; and lay all their &s;hining laurels of victory at the feet of the Great Di&s;po&s;er of all the events of the world: And &s;uffer me to &s;ay, that men who are endowed with the mo&s;t di&s;|tingui&s;hed abilities, are under the greate&s;t obligations of gratitude to that good God, who formed them capable of &s;erving the intere&s;ts of mankind, and being his mini|&s;ters to &s;upport ju&s;tice and mercy among the inhabitants of the earth. Happy that nation, where the&s;e vicegerents of heaven are a pure and living example of their mo&s;t virtuous RECOMMENDATIONS. Who will

give weight and energy to their laws and re&s;olutions, by their fir&s;t and mo&s;t &s;teady per&s;onal ob&s;ervation of them; and &s;hew mankind, "that virtue alone is happine&s;s below."</P>
<P>Since then, my friends, "it hath plea&s;ed almighty God to a&s;&s;i&s;t and &s;upport the Uni|ted States of America, in their important &s;truggle for liberty again&s;t the long and continued efforts of a powerful nation;" it mu&s;t be not only our indi&s;pen&s;able duty, but our greate&s;t intere&s;t, to perpetuate our gra|titude, by learning righteou&s;ne&s;s. Under the invoked a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the &s;ame merciful God, let us pro&s;ecute this war with more unanimity and unabating re&s;olutions. Di|vine providence has pointed out our duty, and calls us by the mo&s;t &s;ignal in&s;tance of interpo&s;ition, to perform his work, and to give our enemies no re&s;t, until they be forced to &s;ee the inju&s;tice of their intenti|ons, and the cruelty of their warfare. Could my influence reach as far as my wi&s;hes are extended; could I appear before the inhabitants of the United States in all the irre&s;i&s;table maje&s;ty of ancient elocution; could I wield the thunder of Demo&s;thenes, and arre&s;t the lightning of Pericles; how &s;hould the nerves of oppo&s;ition to our country be withered, and every American be fired into a patriot or a &s;oldier.</P>

Ye American friends to your country, this is a year of glory and public felicity! you can now with the calm and dignified triumph of freemen look back, and &s;mile on the toils and dangers you have &s;u&s;tained in this righteous conflict! You can with a pious plea&s;ure and awe mark the goodne&s;s and wi&s;dom of Providence! You can add plea&s;ure and delight to all the&s;e affections of the mind by a more animated gratitude and a purer zeal! This day brings you nearer the full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e earthly ble&s;&s;ings for which you have &s;o ardently panted! Your pro&s;pects are fairer and brighter than they have ever been! and if you are not wanting to your&s;elves, all the ble&s;&s;ings of freedom are yours! The Lord helps you and invites you by every nation|al ble&s;&s;ing to renew your exertions; to pre&s;s on and gain a complete conque&s;t over the tyranny of your enemies! But &s;hould you be di&s;obedient to the calls and &s;miles of heaven; &s;hould you neglect the intere&s;t of your country; remember, you may have rea&s;on to cur&s;e your indolence and impiety when it is too late!

The&s;e con&s;iderations &s;hould be motives of encouragement and new zeal; but not the grounds of &s;loth and inaction. Honor, ju&s;tice and our national character demands our utmo&s;t exertions to prove that we are worthy to be allied to a nation who have bravely fought and generou&s;ly bled in this war.</P>
<P>Oh Louis the XVI live forever! Oh that my words were like the words of an angel! I would wing them to thy ears! Or could I borrow from &s;ome guardian angel of America his &s;wift pinions!
