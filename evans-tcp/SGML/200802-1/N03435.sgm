<P>THE U&s;efulne&s;s of Souldiers in this pre&s;ent world of Sin and Lu&s;ts, Together with the Honour and Dignity of that Employment, is a thing almo&s;t all Nations Acknowlege and Approve. But then by how much the more Nations are Civilized and become Polite, by &s;o much the

more is the Martial Art Improv'd and Advan|ced: And by Con&s;equence, becomes &s;o much the more Honourable and U&s;eful; Improves and Enobles the Minds of men: And there|fore as its Improvements and U&s;e is of great Advantage to mankind, &s;o it is both Rea&s;ona|ble and Laudable for men to Endeavour to Ac|compli&s;h them&s;elves with Military Knowlege and Skill.</P>
<P><HI>DAVID</HI> that man after God's own heart, As he confe&s;&s;es, P&s;al. CXLIV 1. <HI>God had taught his hands to War, and his fingers to fight;</HI> So has be made and Dedicated one of his be&s;t Poems, To and upon, Military Employment; I mean that which is u&s;ually &s;tiled David's Elegy, or Mourning over the Death of Saul and Jonathan, Recorded II <HI>Samuel, Chap.</HI> I.</P>
<P>The Poem (as one<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">The Rev. Mr. <HI>Symmes,</HI> in his <HI>Lovel</HI> Lamented.</NOTE> Expre&s;&s;es it) is a Mar|tial Poem; 'Tis written with a truly Martial &s;pirit and life; The Subject is entirely Mili|tary; And as it di&s;covers the Greatne&s;s of David'<HI>s</HI> &s;pirit; &s;o no words can more Commend the true Grandure of a Military Life, or &s;et forth the Honour of tho&s;e that Excel in Mar|tial Knowlege; &s;uch as Saul &amp; Jonathan were.</P>

Nor is the Bu&s;ine&s;s of a Souldier Incon&s;i&s;tent with the Life or Character of a Chri&s;tian; Tho&s;e that are the profe&s;s'd Subjects of the Kingdom of Peace; yet are many times called forth into the Field to hear the <HI>Confu&s;ed noi&s;e of Battle and have their Garments Rolled in blood.</HI> God has not therefore been unmindful of them; Such is the Excellency and Compre|hen&s;ive Nature of God's Word, that therein even a Souldier may learn much of his Duty; and how to Conduct him&s;elf as to be Ap|prov'd of GOD <HI>and be Acceptable in the mid&s;t of his</HI> Brethren.</P>
<P>A Souldier is not a per&s;on Exempted from the Laws of Rea&s;on or Religion; nor left to live at an Ungoverned and Lawle&s;s manner; (Tho' too often they give them&s;elves too large a Liberty in this Re&s;pect.) But the Laws of Honour, Ju&s;tice and Sobriety are Equally obliging upon them, as on other men. God has therefore Taught them what he Re|quires of them, &amp; what it is they ought to Do. Our Text and Context, has an Immediate and Direct relation hereunto; They <HI>Demand, What &s;hall we do?</HI> And John gives them a brief, but very Comprehen&s;ive Direction what their Duty is; Thus, <HI>The Souldiers al&s;o Demanded, And what &s;hall we Do?</HI></P>

I &s;hall not at this time trouble you with any Critical Ob&s;ervations upon the Text; Either who the&s;e Souldiers<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">I am &s;en&s;ible by Souldiers here. Expo&s;itors in general <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> of the Roman Militia left &amp; kept to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> the Country in Quiet. But as we Read, <HI>Luke</HI> XXII 52. of the Captains of the Temple; and as it is Evident there were &s;ome of the Prie&s;ts or Levites, who&s;e Employment was to be a Guard upon the Temple, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And as John'<HI>s</HI> as well as our SA|VIOUR'<HI>s</HI> Mini&s;try, &s;eems to be much Confined to the Lo&s;t Sheep of the Hou&s;e of I&s;rael; It mayn't &s;eem altogether Improbable the&s;e Souldiers were of this &s;ort. But of which Number &s;oever (Either Jews or Romans) they were, &s;eems of no great moment to our pre&s;ent purpo&s;e.</NOTE> were; or concerning the Per&s;on of whom the Demand is made, who was John Bapti&s;t, the forerunner of Chri&s;t; It may &s;uffice in General to &s;ay, That among the many that came to hear John's Mini&s;try, and Enquire their Duty, the Souldiers came al&s;o to him and <HI>Demanded of him, What &s;hall we do?</HI> The whole of the Account is perfectly Souldier-like; The Enquiry is expre&s;s'd with the very Air and &s;pirit of a Souldier in it; They Demanded; They &s;peak as men of true Greatne&s;s of mind, as per&s;ons who were not accu&s;tomed to be Demed. 'Tis Recorded of the other per&s;ons, that came before to John, that they A&s;ked,&mdash;But the Souldiers De|manded,
<PB N="5" REF="004193_0007_1003F7E622ABBF68">
And what &s;hall we Do? And by John's gentle and pious An&s;wer and Directions to them, 'Tis abundantly plain, that as he no ways Di&s;approv'd of their Calling, &s;o a Soul|dier may be Taught what he &s;hould do from the Laws of Religion.</P>
<P>From whence in general we may make the&s;e Two Remarks.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Remark,</HI> That the Employment of a Soul|dier is what both GOD and the Go&s;pel, do Allow, Countenance and Approve of.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Remark,</HI> A Preacher of Chri&s;t, may with|out going beyond the bounds of his Duty, Preach to and In&s;truct Souldiers in their Duty.</P>
<P>But what I &s;hall at this time In&s;i&s;t upon and &s;peak unto from the words, I &s;hall ca&s;t into this method, under Three Doctrinal Propo|&s;itions, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR></P>
<P>I. 'Tis a Duty, and what a People of God &s;hould take care of, That there be among them tho&s;e Train'd up in the Knowlege &amp; Bu&s;ine&s;s of Souldiers; as that they may become Va|liant Souldiers to fight the Lord's Battles, and be Couragious for them&s;elves, for their Land and for their Families.</P>
<P>II. Con&s;ider what Influence &amp; Countenance the Word of God does afford, to Excite and move per&s;ons to faithful &amp; &s;incere endeavours to Accompli&s;h them&s;elves as good Souldiers.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="004193_0008_1003F6CDEE6FB200">
III. Both Rea&s;on &amp; Experience di&s;cover it is the Duty of Souldiers to Endeavour e&s;peci|ally to become Skilful, in tho&s;e Methods of Martial Knowlege, as may furni&s;h them to be, and in the be&s;t manner make them a Defence to their Country &amp; an&s;wer the Ends of Soul|diers.</P>
<P>We begin with Con&s;idering,</P>
<P>PROP. I. <HI>'Tis a Duty, and what a People of God &s;hould take &s;pecial care of, that there be among them tho&s;e Trained up in the Knowlege &amp; Bu&s;ine&s;s of Soul|diers, as that they may become Valiant Souldiers, to fight the Lord's Battles, and be Couragious for them&s;elves, for their Land and for their Families.</HI></P>
<P>That the Employment and Bu&s;ine&s;s of Soul|diers is Countenanced and Approv'd, even un|der the Go&s;pel, &s;eems to me plain from our Text. Had it been again&s;t the mind of God, that men &s;hould have been thus Employ'd in this Bu&s;ine&s;s, doubtle&s;s John, who&s;e mini&s;try was that of Repentance, would have roughly and &s;everely Reproved them and forbidden it.</P>
<P>And both the voice of Experience &amp; Rea&s;on, which in this ca&s;e is the voice of God, di&s;cover the Nece&s;&s;ity thereof, and plainly dictate how much it is a Duty for men to become Expert and Valiant Souldiers: that they may be able to an&s;wer that noble Exhortation of Joab to the Souldiers of Judah, 2 Sam X 12. <HI>That they
<PB N="7" REF="004193_0009_1003F7EE67FAB9D8">
be of good Courage and play the men for their Peo|ple and for the Cities of their God.</HI></P>
<P>I am not come up into the Pulpit to teach the Arts of War. This is not the bu&s;ine&s;s of a Mini&s;ter of the Kingdom of Peace. But as Souldiers may demand of &s;uch, <HI>And what &s;hall we do:</HI> So as the Go&s;pel de&s;cends to con&s;ider men in every Condition and Station they are placed in Providence. As it In&s;tructs them to be Faithful in the Calling in which they are, &s;o it abundantly Countenances &amp; Encourages per&s;ons being Train'd up in Martial Know|lege; and that tho&s;e that have Abilities there|for, endeavour to furni&s;h &amp; accompli&s;h them|&s;elves as good Souldiers.</P>
<P>What&s;oever may hereafter be in the world, as yet we know and &s;ee the Time is not come, that men beat their Swords into Plough &s;hares, or their Spears into Pruning-hooks; that Na|tion &s;hould not ri&s;e up again&s;t Nation, nor the people learn War any more. And however Peaceable the principles and de&s;igns of Reli|gion may be, yet they don't Conquer men to an entire Subjection to them, So but that a people are &s;ometimes Call'd to the Sword, even to Defend the Enjoyment of the Privi|leges of the Go&s;pel. And &s;o it is likely that Wars and Fightings will be, as long as Satan's Malice and Mens Lu&s;ts are &s;o Powerful in the world. Nor is a Martial &s;pirit Incon&s;i&s;tent

with the Profe&s;&s;ion of Religion, The be&s;t of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> left on Sacred Record, have their Names Extoll'd for their Valour in the Exerci&s;e and Arts of War, as I may &s;hew hereafter. Nor is it the De&s;ign of Religion, nor does it ever <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> to take away from men, or deprive them of the nece&s;&s;ary or prudent means of Self-pre&s;ervation and Self-defence, or Safety of their Families or Country.</P>
<P>This Land of Chri&s;tians has in a peculiar manner found the Advantage thereof. Under GOD, our Lives, our Religion, our Liberties are owing to the Valiant &amp; Martial Atchieve|ments of tho&s;e of our Fore-fathers, who were mighty in Battle. El&s;e to all Humane proba|bility, they would have been &s;wallowed up at once, as it were, by the Va&s;t Numbers of their Indian Enemies, <HI>who&s;e tender mercies are Cruelty.</HI></P>
<P>I know the Common-place Objections again&s;t Military Exerci&s;e; Why our Enemies are all De&s;troyed, It don't look likely we &s;hall ever be engag'd in War. Be&s;ides, we live in a cor|ner of the world, as it were, and none will con|cern them&s;elves about us. The World &s;eems to be al&s;o all at Peace; and 'tis needle&s;s and unnece&s;&s;ary to trouble our &s;elves in this Mat|ter. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> Earne&s;t, are the&s;e Objections? Are our Enemies all De&s;troyed? Whence then of late Years, have we tho&s;e of our Young men

called forth into the high places of Battle? And what Numbers of Enemies are round a|bout us on our Borders, which if permitted by God, like Locu&s;ts could and would come up and cover our Land. They are prone to Cru|elty and Revenge of them&s;elves, which the Popi&s;h Incendiaries from pretences of Reli|gion, cea&s;e not to &s;tir up their &s;avage minds to Cruelty and Blood&s;hed.</P>
<P>The French (if the Judgment of a late In|genious<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Mr. Addi&s;on.</HI></NOTE> Author may be relied upon) are the mo&s;t Inveterate &amp; Dangerous Enemies to the Engli&s;h Nation. The&s;e are they that nearly Border upon; yea, in &s;ome &s;en&s;e Compa&s;s us round about. Who both by Intere&s;t, and more e&s;pecially the Prejudices of their Religion, are &s;et again&s;t us; &s;o that perhaps, no People are more Envied and hated by their Neighbours. And &s;hould Wars break forth among the Na|tions, which may be &s;ooner than our Expecta|tions, we can expect no other but there would be tho&s;e who would Endeavour and u&s;e all their Power to &s;wallow us up.</P>
<P>The Great GOD holds the Supreme Domi|nion over all Worlds &amp; all Things; He Reigns in Heaven, Thrones and Dominions, Princi|palities and Powers being Subject to him: His
<PB N="10" REF="004193_0012_1003F7B05B158090">
Dominion Extends over all the Children of men. As by him Kings Reign, &s;o he cuts in &s;under the &s;pirits of Princes, &s;catters their Coun&s;els, &amp; di&s;appoints their wi&s;e&s;t Mea&s;ures, and overturns the mo&s;t peaceable &amp; prudent Mea&s;ures; &s;o that whatever fair pro&s;pects of Peace may &s;eem to appear, through the wi&s;e and prudent Coun&s;els of our Gracious KING, yet what Changes may be in the Right Hand of GOD Mo&s;t High, none can &s;ay; and all Endeavours for Peace be bla&s;ted and di&s;ap|pointed; and we called to hear the Alarum of the Trumpet, and the Noi&s;e and confu&s;ed Sound of Battle&mdash;.</P>
<P><HI>NEW-ENGLAND</HI> has been famous for men of Military genius and Courage for Soul|diers, <HI>Valiant in fight.</HI> Of which we in this Government, have not (perhaps) been a whit behind the very Chiefe&s;t of all,<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">I can't look back upon the Great <HI>Major Ma&s;on,</HI> in the <HI>Pequod</HI> War, without a peculiar Regard and Honour to his memory. Nor are the Succeeding Worthies in after Times of Trouble to be Neg|lected or forgotten, Who Signalized them&s;elves in Valour and Succe&s;s; E&s;pecially the principal &s;nare our Forces under their Great Commanders bore in the Succe&s;s again&s;t the <HI>Nanhagansit In|dians</HI> and Fort.

<PB N="11" REF="004193_0013_1003F7F7B1CC0430">
Lamentable how much a true Martial &s;pirit is laid a&s;ide; And men are not only Carele&s;s and unconcerned about it;&mdash;as if they had no Bu&s;ine&s;s,&mdash;As if they had no Lives, worth Fighting for,&mdash;No Country&punc; worth a Saving. But &s;peak of it and too often Treat it with Contempt. And thus by weakning the Hands of their Neighbours, they di&s;courage all becoming and Honourable En|deavours to attain the Skill. Shall we thus lo&s;e our Name, and Expo&s;e all that is Dear and Valuable together! Ignorance in Mili|tary affairs is the Mother of Cowardi&s;e, and tends to make men of a Little and fearful &s;pirit and Soul. Men indeed may Talk very High, and vent them&s;elves in Big &s;welling Words before hand; and make a great pre|tence and fair Shew: But certainly a per&s;on of Rea&s;on and Con&s;ideration, who comes into the Field ignorant of Military Exerci&s;e, mu&s;t feel &s;omething (tho' with a much wor&s;e &s;pirit) like David, in an Armour he had not proved.</P>

Be&s;ides, Were not the&s;e things &s;o; Yet there is &s;o much true Manline&s;s and Grandure in Military Exerci&s;e: It in&s;pires the Mind with &s;uch Ju&s;t, Honourable and Exalted Notions and di&s;po&s;itions: It &s;o much tends to bani&s;h Littlene&s;s and meanne&s;s, and fill men with Greatne&s;s of &s;pirit. (For, a truly Valiant Souldier would di&s;dain to Kill even his Enemy in a little Under-hand and &s;neaking manner.) I &s;ay, were it upon the&s;e Con&s;iderations only, Every per&s;on who has any Reli&s;h for what is Ju&s;t, Manly and Honourable, would labour to maintain it for the good of Mankind.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Its ob&s;ervable of the old <HI>Romans,</HI> as a martial &s;pirit Decay'd among them, in proportion Luxury pre|vail'd; and con&s;equently Effeminacy and a Train of Vices over&s;pread them, Which as it &s;unk their Reputation, &s;o by degrees Ended in the Ruine of their Country. And 'tis u&s;ually found True, where a Generous &amp; Military &s;pirit &s;inks and De|cays, Luxury&mdash;and Wickedne&s;s that brings a people Low, overflows as a Flood, Even again&s;t the Re&s;traints and under all the Advantages of Religion.</NOTE></P>
<P>War is one of the Heavy Judgments where|with God puni&s;heth a wicked and Back&s;liding People. And when we Con&s;ider our many Crying Sins; &s;o provoking to Heaven and de|filing our Land: When we con&s;ider the Im|pudence

we are grown up to in Sin; the Ingrati|tude and Decay of Religion that is pure and undefiled before God; When we con&s;ider how little of a &s;pirit of Repentance and Amendment is to be found among us, after &s;o many repeated Threatnings and Warnings from GOD in his Word,&mdash;From His Mini&s;ters, the Watch|men of this his Jeru&s;alem,&mdash;And by his Judgments. Can we expect any other but that he will Judge us for the&s;e things, and Avenge his Soul on &s;uch a People, whom in a &s;pe|cial &s;en&s;e <HI>He has Known above all the Families of the Earth,</HI> By &s;ending the Sword to Devour, as well as other Judgments to Con&s;ume and De|&s;troy us.</P>
<P>But thus much may &s;erve to Illu&s;trate and Confirm the fir&s;t Truth propo&s;ed. I &s;hall therefore now proceed briefly to Con&s;ider,</P>
<P>PROP. II. <HI>What Influence and Countenance the Word of God does afford to Excite and move per&s;ons to faithful and &s;incere Endeavours, to Accompli&s;h them&s;elves as good Souldiers.</HI></P>
<P>And here I might begin and tell you, 'Tis the Title and Character the Great GOD takes to Him&s;elf, That he is the LORD of Ho&s;ts, the GOD of Armies. And &s;till more to the purpo&s;e; Mo&s;es in the fir&s;t Song Recorded in Scripture, thus &s;peaks of him, <HI>The LORD is a

<P>I might al&s;o add, 'Tis the Stile and Character wherein our LORD JESUS CHRIST, the Captain of our Salvation Repre&s;ents him&s;elf, <HI>The Captain of the Ho&s;t of the Lord,</HI> Jo&s;h. V. 14.

<P>It may be ob&s;erved al&s;o, Satan is a &s;kilful Warriour, and has Slain his Ten Thou&s;ands: And that in order to oppo&s;e him Succe&s;sfully, To Engage again&s;t <HI>Principalities and Powers and the Rulers of the darkne&s;s of this world, again&s;t wicked Spirits in high places,</HI> which is the bu&s;ine&s;s of Chri&s;tians; it may be of good Advantage for men to Know &s;omething of the bu&s;ine&s;s of Warring.</P>
<P>I might al&s;o reckon up and &s;et before you a Catalogue of tho&s;e Worthies which in &s;acred Scripture are Renown'd for their Martial Skill, as well as Singular Piety. What a Name did Abraham the Father of the Faithful gain to him&s;elf by his Val<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">rous overthrow of the Four Kings, as Recorded, <HI>Gen XIV.</HI>&mdash;And that with the Train'd Souldiers of his own Hou&s;e?</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="004193_0017_1003F7079EA609F0">
David that Excellent King, the man after God's own Heart, was al&s;o Remarkable for his Military Skill and Warlike Actions; and that not only in his Younger years, when he &s;lew the Phil<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">ian Champion Goliah; but al&s;o after|wards, when God Rais'd and &s;et him at the Head of his E&s;pou&s;ed I&s;rael. It would be too Tedious to reckon up and tell you of Gideon, Jephtha and Samp&s;on, of Jo&s;hua &amp; the Judges, of Jeho&s;haphat, Afa, Hezekiah, and the good King Jo&s;iah, who was Slain and lo&s;t his Life in Battle</P>
<P>I might add in the la&s;t place, The Life of a Chri&s;tian is called a Warfare. As &s;uch we are to put on the whole Armour of God, To fight the good fight,&mdash;To endure Hardne&s;s as good Souldiers; So &s;ays the Apo&s;tle Paul, Fight I not as one that beateth the Air, I <HI>Cor.</HI> IX. 26.

The Bow is here Expre&s;s'd by being the chief War|like In&s;trument then in u&s;e: E&s;pecially that wherein the Phili&s;tines, their then pre&s;ent and mo&s;t terrible Enemies, were Expert in the u&s;e of,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I forbear mentioning here, that well known place, Rom. XIII. 1. <HI>The Powers that be are of God.</HI> Since it may, perhaps be thought a &s;tretching the A|po&s;tle's &s;en&s;e too far&mdash;: But when we Con|&s;ider, The general Latitude of the Expre&s;&s;ion. <HI>The Powers that be.</HI> When al&s;o we Con&s;ider, The Ro|man Emperors Borrowed this Name from the Army, as Chief General; perhaps the Apo&s;tle's Expre&s;&s;ion may fairly enough Extend to Military Officers,&mdash;or Powers; as well as Civil Power properly &s;o called.</NOTE></P>
<P>Now I can't but con&s;ider this Command as &s;till in Force among God's Spiritual Judah. Martial Knowlege being &s;till as nece&s;&s;ary, and as u&s;eful, as it was in David'<HI>s</HI> time: And where the Rea&s;on and Nature of things continue the &s;ame, our Obligation thereunto &s;eems al&s;o to be binding upon us.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="004193_0019_1003F8029215D648">
And from this Example of David, to me it appears, Our chief Military Officers &s;hould &s;ee to it, and u&s;e all proper Endeavours, that Mili|tary Skill and Knowlege &s;hould be Encouraged and promoted.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Again,</HI> That Military Employ is Coun|tenanced in God's Word, appears from the many grand and di&s;tingui&s;hing Characters that are given to Souldiers that are Valiant and Ex|pert. Thus they are call'd, The Excellency or Beauty&mdash;The Glory of a People. When therefore David Employs his pen in that noble manner to Lament Saul &amp; Jonathan, He begins and ends his Poem, thus; The Beauty of I&s;rael is &s;lain,&mdash;How are the Mighty fallen!&mdash;And can words be thought of more &s;trongly,&mdash;or more greatly to de&s;cribe the Excellency and Glory of Valiant Souldiers?&mdash;<HI>They were &s;tronger than Lions&mdash;They were &s;wifter than Eagles.</HI> Saul, tho' perhaps he was a wicked man, yet was a noble Souldier; God gave him another Heart, the Heart or &s;pirit of a Soul|dier.</P>
<P N="3">3. Valiant Souldiers, are under GOD, the &s;upreme Refuge and Defence, the Security and Safety of a People. Upon &s;uch does very much the Earthly Security, Peace &amp; Happine&s;s of a People depend: As they are an Awe and Guard again&s;t Encroaching Enemies; or a De|fence again&s;t tho&s;e that Invade and Spoil them.
<PB N="18" REF="004193_0020_1003F7C029E92040">
A People or Land without &s;uch men, is in &s;ome &s;ort like the Vineyard of God&mdash;<HI>Who&s;e Hedge is taken away, and its Stone-wall &amp; Tower, broken down,</HI> and lies open a Prey for the wild Bea&s;ts of the wilderne&s;s to devour and de&s;troy it. David therefore who well knew the Safety of making God his Tru&s;t, and that this was his principal Defence; yet ble&s;&s;es God who taught his Hands to fight and his Fingers to war.</P>
<P>And to Repre&s;ent this &s;afety and Defence to us, the Church, under Chri&s;t, is thus de&s;cribed, Cant III. 7, 8 <HI>Behold, his bed, which is Solomon's: Three&s;core valiant men are about it, of the valiant of I&s;rael They all hold Swords being expert in War: Every man hath his Sword upon his thigh,</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>But I proceed briefly to &s;ay;</P>
<P>PROP III. <HI>Both Rea&s;on and Experience di&s;cover it is the duty of Souldiers, to Endeavour, e&s;pecially to become Skilful in tho&s;e methods of Martial Know|lege, as may furni&s;h them to be, and in the be&s;t manner make them, a Defence to their Country, and an&s;wer the End of Souldiers.</HI></P>
<P>I need, and &s;hall &s;ay little under this Head. The Propo&s;ition being Evident from tho&s;e that are foregoing, and the End and De&s;ign of Soul|diers. Let me ju&s;t Ob&s;erve to you; Almo&s;t every Country have their differing ways of ma|king War upon their Neighbours. And almo&s;t
<PB N="19" REF="004193_0021_1003F70C23BC4508">
every Country, or Age, makes &s;ome alterations in the In&s;truments of Methods of War. The pre&s;ent is very Different from the former Age, and that from the ancient ways of Warring. Be&s;ides, there are many Stratagems &amp; Methods of making War that are very u&s;eful &amp; nece&s;&s;ary to be Known by Souldiers&mdash;: Now then as the Bu&s;ine&s;s, End and De&s;ign of Souldiers principally, is to be a Defence and Safety to their Country, it highly becomes &s;uch, e&s;pecially tho&s;e that would be Expert, and in the be&s;t manner an&s;wer the End thereof, to labour to Know and under&s;tand every thing that may Enable them in the be&s;t manner to Attack and Oppo&s;e Battle, and Vanqui&s;h the Enemies they are or may be called to Encounter.</P>
<P>But I ha&s;ten to make &s;ome brief <HI>IM|PROVEMENT.</HI></P>
<P>And here in the fir&s;t place,</P>
<P>USE, I. <HI>Is it as we have heard? Then we may Infer, The Art Military is what every Per&s;on &s;hould Labour to Encourage and Countenace.</HI> I would not here be under&s;tood, nor do I mean, That every man &s;hould him&s;elf labour to be a Souldier. God has di&s;tributed his Gifts to men Variou&s;ly, as plea&s;es Him. One is a good Tradesman&mdash;, Another is Skilful in Me|chanicks&mdash;; On another has he be&s;towed
<PB N="20" REF="004193_0022_1003F7CA066832A0">
the &s;pirit of a Souldier, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Such then &s;hould Endeavour to Accompli&s;h them&s;elves for that Bu&s;ine&s;s; And all &s;hould promote &amp; Encourage it.</P>
<P>And this &s;hould be the Rule for Souldiers in Chu&s;ing, or others who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s it is in Appointing and Commi&s;&s;ionating of Military Officers, Even tho&s;e that are mo&s;t Expert and Valiant and furni&s;hed with a Martial &s;pirit. Every good man is not nece&s;&s;arily a good Soul|dier, or qualified for Military Po&s;ts &amp; Power.</P>
<P>I know 'tis too much the Humour of people not to Regard this very much;&mdash;And if men Labour to furni&s;h them&s;elves with Military Knowlege; Pre&s;ently, He is an Ambitious and a&s;piring man,&mdash;He &s;han't be promoted to any place. An unju&s;t and &s;hameful Principle where it prevails.</P>
<P>As tho&s;e that are mo&s;t knowing and Skilful, are the propere&s;t per&s;ons for &s;uch Employ, &s;o &s;uch Indu&s;try and Endeavours &s;hould be En|couraged &amp; Rewarded, by the proper Honours that belong thereunto.</P>
<P>USE II. <HI>Is it &s;o&mdash;? Then hence, Souldiers &s;hould Endeavour by all proper and nece&s;&s;ary Methods to gain and furni&s;h them&s;elves with the Knowlege of every part of Military Skill.</HI> It is not Enough, That they Under&s;tand the Bu&s;ine&s;s of the Training Field, the Exerci&s;e of the Gun, or
<PB N="21" REF="004193_0023_1003F80726724900">
Spear, or other Military In&s;truments, to Bran|di&s;h the Sword, and conduct them&s;elves grace|fully in every part of Exerci&s;e; 'Tis not eno', That they under&s;tand the words of Command, and know how to March Regularly; <HI>Keep their Ranks and Files;</HI> That they are acquainted with the proper Facings, and make good their Ground.</P>
<P>But they &s;hould Obey the Commands of their Officers Chearfully, and under&s;tand the &s;everal beats of the Drum, that great Warlike In&s;trument; They &s;hould learn the reviving and animating Sound of the &s;hrill Trumpet, that noble &amp; reviving Sound; The Trumpet, that great Re&s;emblance of the Alarum to the final Judgment.</P>
<P>They &s;hould al&s;o learn how to Charge their Enemies Succe&s;sfully; How to make Choice of the mo&s;t Advantagious Ground; when to Advance; and how to make a regular, &s;afe and Advantagious Retreat.</P>
<P>Moreover, It becomes them to Endeavour to learn the Art of Encamping&mdash;, How to Defend them&s;elves by Entrenchments and the methods of Circumvallation&mdash;: How to Fortify and Defend our Coa&s;ts, or Borders, by Ca&s;tles, Forts &amp; Garri&s;ons; How to Be&s;iege our Enemies; to Batter down or Scale their Walls; Break their Ramparts, and force them to Surrender.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="004193_0024_1003F7CB91DEBCD0">
How al&s;o to pur&s;ue a Victory Succe&s;sfully when it is gained, And all &s;uch Stratagems and ways in u&s;e in Times of War and which Accompli&s;h a Souldier.</P>
<P>In a word, How to be and how to Endure Hardne&s;s as good Souldiers.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, I can't but think it part of the Bu|&s;ine&s;s of Souldiers, to under&s;tand the ways of Fighting by Sea; in which &s;o much of the Engli&s;h Strength lies; and in which they have been &s;o Superior and Succe&s;sful. That they be not Strangers to the various ways of Enga|ging in &s;uch Battles; Boarding their Enemies, and Ma&s;tering their Oppo&s;ers. Together with heaving of Bombs, tho&s;e terrible In&s;tru|ments of De&s;truction; and all other parts of that way of Warring.</P>
<P>I might add, 'Tis a Souldiers Duty and Bu&s;ine&s;s, To &s;ee to it and take &s;pecial care their Arms be kept in good Order, and them|&s;elves well furni&s;hed with Armory, and they ever fit for Service. And be &s;ure never enter into or appear in the Field, unle&s;s in every part they are Accompli&s;hed and Furni&s;hed for Souldiers.</P>
<P>How Ridiculous does a man appear in Pub|lick, when but Half Dre&s;s'd? Or like David'<HI>s</HI> Me&s;&s;engers, with their Beards half Shaved; or their Garments cut off by their Skirts?</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="004193_0025_1003F711F0E2D4E0">
As much Ridiculous &amp; Un&s;eemly is it, for a Souldier to appear in the Field without every part of his Armour well Ordered. And I think Officers &s;hould be both Exemplary and very Careful in this point. But I proceed to &s;ay,</P>
<P>USE, III. <HI>Is it as we have heard? Then we may al&s;o learn, 'Tis a Laudable &amp; Worthy Undertaking when men lay them&s;elves out and Endeavour to make them&s;elves Accompli&s;hed Souldiers, and gain all the nece&s;&s;ary Knowlege &amp; Skill therefor.</HI> When their Martial &s;pirit is warmed and takes fire; and their hearts are animated to Endeavour to Acquire that Martial Knowlege as may fit them to &s;erve GOD and their Country&punc; Its certainly a Glory to a People; and then a Defence upon all that glory, when a Country has many men Skilful in War. And to me, it appears a Reproachful Negligence that Mili|tary Knowlege &amp; affairs are &s;o much neglected and Di&s;regarded; E&s;pecially by tho&s;e of the Military Order: That Guns and Swords mu&s;t lie and be Eaten up with the Ru&s;t&mdash;; Or what is wor&s;e, Men have none at all. And Souldiers appear, Rather as if they were going to &s;ome mean and &s;neaking Employ, they are a&s;ham'd of, than into the Field.</P>
<P>If pride &amp; Gay Attire is any where Tolera|ble, or may be Allowed, it &s;eems to be in

<P>I tru&s;t it is with a De&s;ign for GOD's glory, and a View of rendring your &s;elves U&s;eful in your generation, you now undertake this Bu&s;ine&s;s; and not with a Vain &s;pirit, &s;eeking only Applau&s;e from men and to make a &s;hew,&mdash;</P>
