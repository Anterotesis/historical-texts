<Q>Wi&s;dom and Knowledge &s;hall be the &s;tability of thy Times.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE words are part of a triumphant ode, occa&s;ioned by a prophetick view of the de&s;truction of the A&s;&s;yrian army and power. By &s;uperior &s;trength and numerous forces, this invader of nations, this natural enemy of the Jews, thought to have &s;wallowed up that people, to have &s;lain, or carried them captive into his own land.&mdash;But God had otherwi&s;e determined&mdash;and revealed his deter|mination to his prophet, who repre&s;ents the &s;everal &s;cenes of that tran&s;action, in all the force and &s;ublimity of language, and with all the beauties of a poetical de&s;cription.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">A learned per&s;on ob&s;erves that if a tran&s;lation could be made of this Chapter, that &s;hould come up to the original, it would appear to be as noble a piece of poetry as is to be found among the mo&s;t admired writings of the ancients. LOWTH'S Com.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="009361_0009_10321149C0A59E70">
AT the fir&s;t ver&s;e he prophetically relates the de&s;truction and &s;poil of the enemy, whom he characteri&s;es as guilty of great inju&s;tice, violently and treacherou&s;ly entring upon the territory of their neighbours, without any provocation. <HI>Wo to thee that &s;poile&s;t, and thou wa&s;t not &s;poiled, and deale&s;t treacherou&s;ly, and they dealt not treacherou&s;ly with thee.</HI></P>
<P>AT the &s;econd ver&s;e the prophet repre&s;ents, what might naturally be expected from any people in di&s;tre&s;s, but e&s;pecially from a religious and covenant people, their humble addre&s;s and &s;upplication to God for protection and deli|verance. <HI>O Lord be gracious unto us; we have waited for thee: be thou their arm every morn|ing; our &s;alvation al&s;o in the time of trouble.</HI></P>
<P>AT the third and fourth ver&s;es he de&s;cribes the terror, confu&s;ion and de&s;truction of this haughty and treacherous enemy, and the &s;ignal interpo&s;ition of divine providence in that event. <HI>At the noi&s;e of the tumult the people fled; at the li&s;ting up of thy &s;elf the nations were &s;cattered. And your &s;poil &s;hall be gathered, like the gathering of the caterpillar; as the running to and fro of locu&s;ts &s;hall he run upon them.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="009361_0010_1032114C03F04D00">
AT the fifth ver&s;e, the Almighty is intro|duced in great Maje&s;ty, as it were &s;urveying with complacency the ju&s;tice of his own award, and the protection and &s;ecurity he had given to his people. <HI>The Lord is exalted; for he dwelleth on high; he hath filled Zion with judgment and righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>FROM hence he proceeds in the text to de|clare what &s;ort of conduct in his people, would be &s;ure to e&s;tabli&s;h the ble&s;&s;ing of peace and &s;ecurity which God had thus procured them. <HI>Wi&s;dom and knowledge &s;hall be the &s;tability of thy times; and &s;trength of &s;alvation: the fear of the Lord is his trea&s;ure.</HI></P>
<P>THIS prediction or de&s;cription of the prophet was afterwards within about three years, lite|rally fulfilled in the unju&s;t and treacherous attempt of the A&s;&s;yrian, and in his confu&s;ion and defeat, by the hand of divine providence.</P>
<P>AND may we not almo&s;t &s;ay that the &s;ame or a like &s;cene has been repeated in our times? Had we not been deceitfully and unju&s;tly en|croached upon by a powerful and treacherous neighbour? Did he not attempt an inva&s;ion?
<PB N="4" REF="009361_0011_1032114D87F05558">
Did he not &s;eek and labour the de&s;truction of this nation, and e&s;pecially of this land? And to this end, did he not form alliances, and &s;tir up the nations round about, even the barbarous &s;a|vages to plunder and de&s;troy? And did we not addre&s;s, repeatedly addre&s;s the Almighty to &s;ave us from the&s;e violent attempts and unju&s;t en|croachments? We certainly did &s;o&mdash;and I hope we did it &s;eriou&s;ly and in good earne&s;t, from a <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;en&s;e of our danger, and of the nece&s;&s;ity of God's help and protection. At lea&s;t it is certain that God has vi&s;ibly appeared in our favour, in the many in&s;tances of &s;ucce&s;s and triumph we have experienced; he has defeated the coun&s;els, impaired the &s;trength, and humbled our haughty enemy beyond the example of any former time.&mdash;And then as to the con&s;equences of this divine a&s;&s;i&s;tance; we have not only obtained a glorious and honoura|ble peace, but have the faire&s;t pro&s;pect of its &s;tability or continuance both in our times, and to &s;ucceeding generations. I &s;peak here my own &s;en&s;e of the matter, and I tru&s;t al&s;o the opinion of mo&s;t that hear me: Nay it is the public &s;en&s;e likewi&s;e, unle&s;s we mean to affront Almighty God, to mock him with pre|tended thanks, for what we really are not thankful; for to what purpo&s;e is it that we are now a&s;&s;embled together? Is it not to ble&s;s and prai&s;e God, not only for his holy protection
<PB N="5" REF="009361_0012_1032114F6032AD00">
over us, and his gracious a&s;&s;i&s;tance of us, during a long, expen&s;ive and bloody war, but chiefly for di&s;po&s;ing contending monarchs and nations to hearken to the voice of peace; and that too upon &s;uch terms in regard to us, as &s;ome time &s;ince we could &s;carce have hoped for, without the mo&s;t ungrounded partiality in our own favour.</P>
<P>IT is true, there may be &s;ome who appear di&s;&s;atisfied with the terms upon which it is founded; but &s;o perhaps they would if any other terms had been obtained. Di&s;&s;atisfaction with any public admini&s;tration doth not always ari&s;e from what is truly exceptionable in it, but often from quite different motives, more or le&s;s laudable in proportion to the ability, knowledge and integrity of tho&s;e that are in the oppo&s;ition&mdash;Some are deficient in judg|ment, others are unacquainted with the true &s;prings of government; &s;ome are influenced by ambition or vanity, others by intere&s;t or envy: But without inquiring into the motives of di&s;&s;atisfaction which individuals have entertain|ed; it is both determined by public authority, and appears to be the general voice of the nation, that we have a glorious peace, &s;uch as reflects lu&s;tre upon the Briti&s;h coun&s;els, and loudly calls for a univer&s;al and devout acknowledgment to the &s;upreme di&s;po&s;er of all events. But becau&s;e
<PB N="6" REF="009361_0013_10321151994D5350">
even this great ble&s;&s;ing would yield but little &s;atisfaction, without a rea&s;onable pro&s;pect of its continuance. It may be proper to inquire,

<ITEM>I. WHEREIN that &s;tability con&s;i&s;ts, which was promi&s;ed to the Jews, and which now opens a happy pro&s;pect to us. And,</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. HOW this ble&s;&s;ing may be obtained and &s;ecured.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>Now the &s;tability of times &s;eems to &s;uppo&s;e a previous &s;tate of quietne&s;s and peace, and that &s;uch a peace as is generally acceptable; wherein the dignity of the crown, and the honour of the nation is &s;ecured, the full extent of its dominion maintained, and perhaps en|larged, &s;o far at lea&s;t as may be a rea&s;onable &s;ecurity again&s;t future encroachments&mdash;The &s;ources of its wealth, its trade and commerce, pre&s;erved and extended, and in general every ju&s;t right or claim a&s;certained with &s;o much preci&s;ion, as if po&s;&s;ible to leave no room either to ca&s;ual or wilful mi&s;con&s;truction. And this by the ble&s;&s;ing of Almighty God is &s;uppos'd to be our pre&s;ent ca&s;e, and is what we are this day a&s;&s;embled to ble&s;s God for.&mdash;But if in|&s;tead of this we could &s;uppo&s;e a peace to be ra&s;hly or ha&s;tily concluded, without judgment
<PB N="7" REF="009361_0014_103211538BC09F08">
or deliberation, without a proper attention and re&s;olution preci&s;ely to fix and determine every claim which former allowed rights, and the &s;uperiority of arms give ju&s;t rea&s;on to demand; e&s;pecially if any thing grievous and unaccepta|ble to the body of the nation, or to great numbers of the people in it, &s;hould be left unadju&s;ted, in &s;uch a ca&s;e as this, I &s;ay, it is impo&s;&s;ible that the times &s;hould be &s;table or quiet; the nation will be under perpetual apprehen&s;ions of &s;ome new attack, or foreign inva&s;ion, while they are &s;en&s;ible that their treaties have been but loo&s;ly con&s;tructed, or weakly guarded.</P>
<P>STABILITY of times then you &s;ee implies a previous &s;tate of peace, founded upon terms that are honourable, and generally &s;atisfactory. A peace that promi&s;es all rea&s;onable &s;ecurity again&s;t foreign violence, and that leaves no ju&s;t occa&s;ion to faction or di&s;&s;ention at home. In regard to the former perhaps no treaties can be &s;o far relied on, as to di&s;pen&s;e with a con&s;tant &s;tate of preparation, or to neglect &s;ecuring the mo&s;t &s;uitable and natural alliances. And in re&s;pect to the latter, an impartial admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice, and a di&s;intere&s;ted di&s;tribution of rewards, will go a great way in preventing any inbred di&s;turbance; at lea&s;t they will &s;o far &s;uppre&s;s the &s;eeds of faction and di&s;order, that
<PB N="8" REF="009361_0015_1032115511154698">
they will not come to maturity, or acquire &s;trength enough to endanger the peace and quiet of the &s;tate. The&s;e two things therefore &s;eem to be &s;o ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to the peace and tranquility of any nation, that there does not appear, in a human view, any room to hope for &s;tability without their concurrence. For whenever the people have an ill opinion of their treaties, they lo&s;e all confidence in that kind of &s;ecurity, and deliver them&s;elves up to perpetual apprehen&s;ions of violence from a|broad, and this al&s;o naturally produces factions and di&s;turbance at home; &s;o that there can be no &s;uch thing as &s;tability of times, where a peace is not deem'd honourable, and where it is not generally acceptable.</P>
<P>IT is our pre&s;ent happine&s;s in regard to the fir&s;t of the&s;e (I mean foreign violence) to have all the &s;ecurity that human means can give by the late honourable peace, which &s;ince we had the opportunity of making upon our own terms, mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed to contain every thing that we could rea&s;onably demand. This in|deed is a matter that lies entirely with our &s;uperiors, and every good &s;ubject will be cau|tious of cen&s;uring their proceedings, although he &s;hould not perfectly comprehend all the advantages that are &s;aid to ari&s;e from it.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="009361_0016_10321156EB3EC148">
BUT then, as to the other thing nece&s;&s;ary to a permanent peace, the guarding again&s;t mur|muring and faction at home, this will very much, if not wholly depend upon our&s;elves, and pro|vided we are but careful not to give way to a turbulent di&s;po&s;ition, to faction and di&s;content, we may &s;o far con&s;ide in the wi&s;dom of our &s;uperiors as to be under very little apprehen&s;ion of foreign dangers.</P>
<P>No man of the lea&s;t reflection can be in&s;en&s;i|ble what great advantages that nation enjoys, which is not only in a &s;tate of perfect peace with its neighbours, but po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es uninterrupted quiet and tranquility at home, which is neither threatned with foreign in&s;ult, nor mole&s;ted by inbred commotions, which generally &s;peaking, are far more dangerous than the other, at lea&s;t, when they ri&s;e to any con&s;iderable heighth. It has indeed been &s;aid, that 
  <Q>&s;mall di&s;turbances do the &s;ame &s;ervice in the &s;tate that the winds do in the air, by motion to keep it from &s;tag|nation and putrefaction:<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Bp. of Gloce&s;.</NOTE></Q>
but when once the winds are rai&s;ed, no one can tell when they will be laid, or how &s;trong they will grow; and that which was wantonly rai&s;ed to &s;erve a pre|&s;ent turn, may in time come to overturn a con|&s;titution.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="009361_0017_103211597767DE50">
WE mu&s;t not indeed &s;uppo&s;e, that every &s;mall inquietude, that every little party or faction that happens to take place, will be able to accompli&s;h &s;uch extraordinary and pernicious events, yet certainly it will not be di&s;puted, but that they are liable to produce many fatal and de&s;tructive con&s;equences, which tho' not always immediate|ly apparent, will yet in time become &s;ufficiently manife&s;t, in a general corruption of manners, in breaking loo&s;e from all proper re&s;traint, in pro|moting a partial di&s;tribution not only of favours but rewards, directed &s;olely or chiefly by mo|tives of prejudice, party or undue affection, thereby &s;tirring up a bitterne&s;s of re&s;entment, and all the ill effects of envy, anger and malice. By this means the very principles of ju&s;tice and charity will be extingui&s;hed, and each man in &s;upport of his own party will be liable to in|dulge him&s;elf in &s;lander and detraction, and every vice that is di&s;honourable to human na|ture. Now when this &s;ort of corruption be|comes general, it greatly dimini&s;hes if it does not totally eradicate, every &s;entiment of honour, every principle of obedience, and all concern for the public good and &s;afety, which hence|forward, without he&s;itation or remor&s;e are made a &s;acrifice to party de&s;igns, to ambition or vani|ty, to intere&s;t, envy or re&s;entment. When &s;uch a temper as this prevails it mu&s;t greatly perplex the wi&s;e&s;t admini&s;tration, the public coun&s;els

You cannot but remember that the late war was at fir&s;t undertaken in defence of the&s;e remote colonies, and to repel the encroachments that were made upon us by a re&s;tle&s;s enemy; the&s;e ends being now obtained, gratitude as well as duty and intere&s;t, invite us to rejoice in the common happine&s;s, to contribute as far as in us lies in our &s;everal &s;tations, to promote the internal peace order and &s;tability of that go|verment, from whence our &s;afety and felicity, under God, are derived.

Here then it is plain that to cultivate the duties of religion is the mo&s;t effectual if not the only means of procuring &s;tability of times, and con|&s;equently of obtaining a firm and la&s;ting e&s;tab|ment of the peace lately &s;ettled.

<P>BUT without entering into &s;uch an exten&s;ive enquiry, we may venture to affirm, that when|ever God is plea&s;ed to be&s;tow even political wi&s;dom upon tho&s;e who have the conduct of the public affairs of any nation, it is to be ac|knowledged as the effect of his favour, and a rea&s;onable pre&s;umption of that nation's &s;tability.

Therefore it is commonly &s;een, that they, who entring into battle, are careful to pray for aid from heaven, with due acknowledgment of his power, who is the giver of victory; when the field is won, do vaunt of their own exploits; one telling how he got &s;uch a ground of advan|tage; another how he gave check to &s;uch a battalion; a third how he &s;eized on the enemies cannon; every one &s;triving to mag|nify him&s;elf, whil&s;t all forget God, as one that had not been pre|&s;ent in the action.
