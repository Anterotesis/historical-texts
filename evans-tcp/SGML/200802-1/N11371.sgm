<P>Then &s;aid I unto them, Ye &s;ee the Di&s;tre&s;s that we are in, how Jeru&s;a|lem lieth wa&s;te, and the Gates thereof are burnt with Fire: Come, and let us build up the Wall of <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> that we be no more a Reproach. Then I told them of the Hand of my <HI>GOD</HI> which was good upon me; and they &s;aid, let us ri&s;e up and build. So they &s;trengthened their Hands for this good Work: But when <HI>Sanballat,</HI> the <HI>Horonite,</HI> and <HI>Tobiah</HI> the Ser|vant, the <HI>Ammonite,</HI> and <HI>Ge&s;hem,</HI> the <HI>Arabian</HI> heard it, they laughed us to Scorn, and di&s;pi&s;ed us, and &s;aid, What is this thing that ye do?

Then an&s;wered I them, and &s;aid unto them, the <HI>GOD</HI> of Heaven he will pro&s;per us, therefore we his Servants will ari&s;e and build: But you have no Portion, nor Right, nor Memorial in <HI>Jeru&s;alem.</HI></P></Q>

<P>_AFTER much perplexity, and in the mid&s;t of great anxiety, re&s;ulting from the unhappy &s;ituation of our national and American affairs, we once more &s;ee the return of an anniver&s;ary election.</P>
<P>On this occa&s;ion, in which our political fathers attended with crouds of loyal &s;ubjects, and free-born citizens, are come up to the hou&s;e of GOD, to recognize his goodne&s;s, &s;pread our di&s;tre&s;&s;ed ca&s;e before him, and devoutly &s;eek his gracious patronage, I know of no words more &s;uitable to addre&s;s you in, than tho&s;e now read.</P>
<P>They are the words of good <HI>Nehemiah,</HI> in that truly animated &s;peech, in which he addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to his &s;uffering brethren, at <HI>Je|ru&s;alem,</HI> when he came <HI>with the good hand of his</HI> GOD <HI>upon him</HI>; and a
<PB N="6" REF="014383_0005_0F92626D14CDDDE0">
royal mandate from the <HI>Per&s;ian Monarch,</HI> to redre&s;s their grievances and repair the wa&s;tes of <HI>Jeru&s;alem.</HI></P>
<P>They contain every thing &s;uited to our ca&s;e in this dark and trou|ble&s;ome day.</P>
<P>We have here in the fir&s;t place,</P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>Our own condition exactly expre&s;&s;ed, "Ye &s;ee the di&s;tre&s;s that we are in, how</HI> Jeru&s;alem <HI>lieth wa&s;te, and the gates thereof are burnt with fire,</HI>"</P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>What &s;pirit we ought to &s;hew in our di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Circum&s;tances, "They &s;aid, let us ri&s;e up and build, &s;o they &s;trengthened their hands for that good work.</HI>"</P>
<P N="3">III. <HI>The oppo&s;ition to be expected, and embarra&s;&s;ments which frequently attend benevolent endeavours to retrieve a &s;inking nation and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed peo|ple, ari&s;ing from an evil de&s;igning faction. "When</HI> Sanballat, <HI>&amp;c. heard it, they laughed us to &s;corn, di&s;pi&s;ed us, and &s;aid, What is this thing that ye do? Will ye rebel again&s;t the King?</HI>"</P>
<P N="4">IV. <HI>A good re&s;olution per&s;i&s;ted in, fixed on a pious ba&s;is, en&s;uring the great|e&s;t confidence of &s;ucce&s;s, "The</HI> GOD <HI>of Heaven he will pro&s;per us, therefore we his &s;ervants will go on and build:</HI>" And a proper treatment of &s;uch as are unfriendly to due exertions for the public &s;afety, "<HI>You have no portion, right, or memorial in</HI> Jeru&s;alem."</P>
<P>The patience and candor of this numerous and re&s;pectable audi|ence, will bear with me, while I touch on the&s;e re&s;pective branches, in the &s;ub&s;equent di&s;cour&s;e, apparently tending to influence to &s;uita|ble reflections on this &s;olemn occa&s;ion.</P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>We have then our own condition expre&s;&s;ed, "Ye &s;ee the di&s;tre&s;s that we are in, how Jeru&s;alem lieth wa&s;te, and the gates thereof are burnt with fire.</HI>"</P>
<P>Jeru&s;alem was the capital of Judea, and "the center of unity of the Jewi&s;h people, both in religious and civil affairs;" the temple there erected, was an emblem of their religious and civil polity. For "thither the tribes went up to give thanks unto the name of the Lord, and there was the &s;eat of judgment, even the &s;eat of the hou&s;e of <HI>David." P&s;.</HI> cxxii. <HI>v.</HI> 5. The Jewi&s;h per&s;onage, therefore, in de|&s;cribing the afflicted condition of the people, by <HI>the wa&s;tes of Jeru&s;alem,</HI> and her <HI>gates burnt with fire,</HI> &s;ignifies the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed and ruined &s;tate of the people, relative to their religious and civil affairs, and the con&s;e|quent mi&s;eries they felt, as well the demolition of their literal tem|ple by the ravages and flames of war.</P>
<P>In all the&s;e re&s;pects, they were in a mi&s;erable condition indeed. A parallel between their &s;ituation and ours, in every in&s;tance, I pretend not; but a re&s;emblance in &s;ome particulars, and in regard of the de|gree of di&s;tre&s;s, will be &s;ufficiently apparant from a conci&s;e view of our real &s;tate at this day.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="014383_0006_0F92626DCE0589E0">In general the ground of our complaints, is &s;uch things as the&s;e. A determined <HI>plan</HI> already pu&s;hed on, to the a&s;toni&s;hment of all true Engli&s;hmen, calculated in its natural tendency to &s;ubvert the Briti&s;h con&s;titution, which for ages has &s;tood the guardian of the means of her &s;ubject's happine&s;s, the envy of foreign nations, and the admi|ration of the whole world, and to &s;ub&s;titute in the room thereof, <HI>ab|&s;olute de&s;poti&s;m,</HI> and as the certain con&s;equence, <HI>cruel tyranny,</HI> and the <HI>total &s;lavery</HI> of all America.</P>
<P>IN pur&s;uit of <HI>this,</HI> many cruel re&s;olves, and uncon&s;titutional acts of late parliaments, which wore a mo&s;t threatning a&s;pect to the whole continent&mdash;If we would &s;ee their genuine operations and proper ef|fects, we need only advert to a neighbouring province&mdash;there we &s;hall find, they have made an actual &s;eizure of their charter, ravi&s;h|ed its mo&s;t valuable and e&s;&s;ential rights, without giving the people an opportunity to receive conviction of having made a forfeiture, or vindicating their innocency, from the vile &s;lander and wicked mi&s;|repre&s;entations of de&s;igning men.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence the di&s;tre&s;s and confu&s;ion of that devoted province &mdash;their capital filled with the King's troops, their harbour with his &s;hips, on purpo&s;e to compel the people into &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion; their port blockaded up, their trade and bu&s;ine&s;s at an end, the inhabitants, by thou&s;ands, in&s;tantly turned to want and beggary, having no method of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence but on the charitable contributions of their &s;ympathiz|ing brethren, in their own and neighbouring colonies.</P>
<P>In this &s;tate have they endured with great patience and fortitude, till at length we are a&s;&s;ured, by good intelligence, open ho&s;tility is commenced by the King's &s;oldiers. In the late battle at <HI>Concord</HI> and <HI>Lexington, inglorious to the Briti&s;h arms!</HI> they have imbrued their hands in the innocent blood of their fellow &s;ubjects with a relentle&s;s cruelty and inhuman barbarity, too much like that which we have experi|enced from the mercile&s;s &s;avages of the wilderne&s;s.</P>
<P>The metropolis of that unhappy province is now become a <HI>garri&s;on town,</HI> the inhabitants, by thou&s;ands, confined within its walls, in the greate&s;t con&s;ternation, from fearful apprehen&s;ions of being put to the &s;word, or of peri&s;hing by famine.</P>
<P>The whole continent, ju&s;tly alarmed at the&s;e appearances, filled with the deepe&s;t concern for them&s;elves, their po&s;terity, yea the whole Briti&s;h empire.</P>
<P>And further, the embarra&s;&s;ments laid on regular and nece&s;&s;ary procedures, in the &s;everal governments, in managing their own af|fairs,
<PB N="8" REF="014383_0007_0F92626E8F2C00B0">
in&s;omuch that the wi&s;e&s;t &s;tate&s;man &s;carcely knows what way to turn him&s;elf, any more than what will be the final i&s;&s;ue of the pre&s;ent convul&s;ion. The non-importation agreement, in prudence and ne|ce&s;&s;ity extorted, in our own defence, the alienation of his Maje&s;ty's affections from his loyal American &s;ubjects, who ever have been, and &s;till are, ambitious to a&s;&s;ert and maintain their loyalty and ob&s;tinate attachment to his <HI>royal per&s;on, family</HI> and <HI>government,</HI> on principles that at fir&s;t introduced the illu&s;trious hou&s;e of <HI>Hanover</HI> to the throne, and which alone can &s;upport their rights to it, con&s;i&s;tant with the Briti&s;h con&s;titution. The interruption of that mutual confidence and affection that have for &s;o long a time &s;ub&s;i&s;ted, between the pa|rent &s;tate and the colonies, to the great &s;atisfaction and mutual ad|vantage of both. The apparant danger of a total alienation between both countries, to the great injury of each, to &s;ay the be&s;t, and final|ly from the pre&s;ent growing appearances, the eminent danger of be|ing univer&s;ally plunged into the horrors and di&s;tre&s;&s;es of a civil war.</P>
<P>Nor is this machination le&s;s inimical to religious liberty&mdash;our reli|gious privileges and civil liberties are in&s;eperably connected and mu|tually dependant on each other; if therefore the one fails the other cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t long, and the former is in a great degree the barrier of the latter, "in &s;uch a manner as nothing el&s;e can be." Of all our ble&s;&s;ings then, we &s;hould e&s;teem our religion the mo&s;t valuable, and nothing &s;hould &s;o much alarm us, as any attempts to rob or abridge us of freedom, in a full and peaceable enjoyment of it. But the &s;a|cred rights of con&s;cience, and the mo&s;t precious privileges of the go&s;pel, are no le&s;s aimed at than every thing el&s;e dear to us. Two years &s;ince, in a great a&s;&s;embly, on &s;uch an occa&s;ion as this, it was ju&s;tly complained of,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">TURNER's Election Sermon.</NOTE> "how dormant the laws of <HI>England</HI> again&s;t Popery were known" then "to remain"&mdash;and as a &s;pecimen mention was made of "a Roman Catholic Bi&s;hop, at <HI>Canada,</HI> and a Popi&s;h Prie&s;t at <HI>Nova-Scotia,</HI> publicly &s;upported." But now &s;uch has been the rapid progre&s;s of the wicked contrivance we are &s;peaking of, as that, in re&s;pect of the whole country of <HI>Canada</HI> (an extent of above 2000 miles) Popery is the e&s;tabli&s;hed religion, and Prote&s;tani&s;m is &s;uffered to &s;ub&s;i&s;t, only by toleration, and that in &s;uch circum&s;tances, as in all human view, the latter will &s;oon be extirpated by the for|mer, and effectual provi&s;ion, for all this, is &s;ecured by an act of a late parliament, commonly known among us by the name of the
<PB N="9" REF="014383_0008_0F92626F34711450">
<HI>Quebec Bill.</HI> What a &s;hocking figure mu&s;t this make in the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> annals? And what a &s;tigma of di&s;grace and incon&s;i&s;tency mu&s;t it fix on a profe&s;&s;edly Prote&s;tant parliament, for having enacted it: When once this &s;ource of national and colony woe &s;hall have run its length, where are we? To what a wretched &s;tate of oppre&s;&s;ion and &s;lavery &s;hall we be reduced? That fair inheritance which our fathers, the fir&s;t &s;ettlers of this country, purcha&s;ed for us, at the expence of their trea&s;ure and blood, left us po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of by a clear title, confirm|ed by royal charters, in a mo&s;t &s;olemn manner, is extorted from us. The be&s;t religion in the world, we mu&s;t exchange for all the barba|rity, trumpery and &s;uper&s;titions of Popery; or burn at the &s;take, or &s;ubmit to the tortures of the inqui&s;ition. In the&s;e circum&s;tances, who would de&s;ire to live? Yea, who would not "choo&s;e &s;trangling and death rather than life?" This is a ju&s;t and moderate account of the &s;tate of things Whence a plan, that has already produced &s;uch great and univer&s;al misfortune, and if pur&s;ued, mu&s;t and will, in all human view, produce greater beyond all imagination, &s;hould o|riginate, I know but little, and &s;hall &s;ay le&s;s; yet were we to judge from its natural tendency, complexion and effects, we mu&s;t conclude it fir&s;t &s;prang from that original <HI>wicked politician,</HI> who "works in the hearts of the children of di&s;obedience," and has his habitation in the regions of darkne&s;s and cruelty.</P>
<P>To the above we may add, as what encrea&s;es the gloom, and what, with great humility and deep penitence, we &s;hould reflect on, the awful declining &s;tate of religion and virtue, and the fearful preva|lence of almo&s;t every &s;pecies of immorality.</P>
<P>From the&s;e alarming pro&s;pects we cannot but &s;ee "the di&s;tre&s;s we are in," through the nation, and the&s;e colonies in particular. For relief much depends under GOD, on our taking and pur&s;uing the cour&s;e dictated in the pa&s;&s;age under con&s;ideration. This brings me therefore to con&s;ider in the next place,</P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>The &s;pirit we ought to &s;hew in our di&s;tre&s;&s;ed circum&s;tances. "They &s;aid, let us ri&s;e up and build, &s;o they &s;trengthened their hands to this good work."</HI></P>
<P>Here is every thing our ca&s;e requires, in point of human prudence, in order to remove pre&s;ent di&s;tre&s;s, and avert impending ruin: <HI>Particularly,</HI> a firm re&s;olution and vigorous efforts, in oppo&s;ition to a &s;inking de&s;pondency, which enervates action and is often the offspring of di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>Union, in every proper method, is a thing of ab&s;olute importance without which any plan, be it ever &s;o well conceived, will prove abortive.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="014383_0009_0F92627013087B78">The conduct of affairs, at &s;uch a critical juncture, with confi|dence, placed in the hands of &s;uch men, of who&s;e character we have a lively picture, in that of <HI>Nehemiah</HI>; and the people &s;upporting, to the utmo&s;t of their power, their leaders in the common cau&s;e.</P>
<P>It was a very abject condition this ruler found his brethren in when he came to them: They were in bondage to the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> empire, &s;tript of their invaluable priviledges, their temple thrown into heaps of ruin, cruelly oppre&s;&s;ed and in&s;ulted by the King's &s;ervants &s;et o|ver them; &s;ome were de&s;titute of the means of bare &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, o|thers had "mortgaged their lands;" "&s;ome had borrowed money for the King's tribute upon their lands and vineyards," "others ob|liged to &s;ell their &s;ons and daughters, to be &s;ervants, neither was it in their power to redeem them." Had they given way to the&s;e di&s;|couragements, in all probability they never would have emerged from their low and depre&s;&s;ed condition; but being rou&s;ed to vigor|ous exertions, by this &s;pirited addre&s;s, di&s;played a noble fortitude, and were &s;ucceeded.</P>
<P>True indeed, we may in vain expect <HI>&s;alvation from the hills, and the multitude of the mountains</HI>; nor ought our confidence to be placed mere|ly in the be&s;t of men or means; yet it is as true, that Heaven works by proper means and in&s;truments, in the u&s;e of which only, we can rationally expect his interpo&s;ition.&mdash;And when he de&s;igns &s;alvation, he excites a proper &s;pirit, directs and influences to &s;uitable mea&s;ures, as in the ca&s;e of the Jews, in this <HI>great and good work</HI> they had &s;et their hearts upon.&mdash;And has he not in many in&s;tances remarkably ap|peared in our ca&s;e, and given tokens of good, &s;o far at lea&s;t, as to rai&s;e our hopes, and in&s;pire the mo&s;t un&s;haken re&s;olution? With a forti|tude like that di&s;played in the pa&s;&s;age before us, we mu&s;t <HI>ari&s;e and build,</HI> tho' we hold the &s;word in one hand, our lives and liberties in the other. Our very di&s;tre&s;s dictates the mo&s;t undaunted re&s;olution in all lawful mea&s;ures:&mdash;What of this &s;pirit has appeared, &s;hould there|fore be tenderly nur&s;ed. And has there not appeared a becoming re|&s;olution? has it not &s;pread &s;urpri&s;ingly thro' all America? has it not in a proper manner manife&s;ted it&s;elf in the re&s;olves of A&s;&s;emblies, in the appointment and <HI>production</HI> of the <HI>Continental Congre&s;s,</HI> who have performed not only to the approbation, but to the admirati|on of their con&s;tituents.&mdash; Of the la&s;t importance is the &s;tricte&s;t union in every town, and between the towns in every colony, and between the colonies through the whole continent &mdash;</P>
<P>It is not <HI>comparatively</HI> of &s;o much importance what method we pro|ceed

in (if ju&s;t in the &s;ight of Heaven) provided as general and as &s;trict a union as can be expected, be inviolately maintained.&mdash;There is no|thing in human view can give us &s;uch a hopeful pro&s;pect as that u|nion which has obtained&mdash;its parallel is not to be found in all hi&s;to|ric exi&s;tence&mdash;great pains has undoubtedly been taken on one hand to effect it&mdash;great pains on the other to prevent it. To e&s;tabli&s;h and increa&s;e it, will be the great object of attention on one &s;ide,&mdash;to di&s;&s;olve it on the other.&mdash;But after all <HI>the hand of our God is good upon us</HI> in this thing.&mdash;Our enemies mu&s;t confe&s;s it to be a token of good. They did not expect it,&mdash;<HI>laughed</HI> a pretence of it <HI>to &s;corn,</HI> when they &s;aw it were not a little chafed, and confounded; and even our very friends were in doubt about it.&mdash;Heaven be thanked, it has been accompli&s;hed to &s;o great a degree; to the joy of true patrons of liber|ty, and to the embara&s;&s;ment of tyrants, may Heaven increa&s;e and e&s;tabli&s;h it!&mdash;</P>
<P>This is the great hinge, under God, our ALL is like to turn upon,&mdash; If this is kept &s;acred, it is certain, Great-Britain can never carry into execution the pre&s;ent de&s;potic plan of colony admini&s;tration, without the ruin of the whole Briti&s;h empire.&mdash;And unle&s;s the kingdom is ripe for de&s;truction, and de&s;tined to be its own executi|oner, we may rea&s;onably pre&s;ume &s;he will never be &s;o infatuated in the pre&s;ent controver&s;y, as to attempt it by fire and &s;word.&mdash;</P>
<P>Should America be urged to the la&s;t extremity by coercive mea|&s;ures, it is to be hoped we &s;hall be found not to have lo&s;t, entirely, the BRAVE SPIRIT which re&s;ted on our Fathers, and that things unex|pected will in providence turn up in our favour.&mdash;</P>
<P>It was well &s;aid, near twenty years &s;ince, by a writer who&s;e general &s;entiments are &s;ufficiently in favour of prerogative mea&s;ures, <HI>We have a thou&s;and in&s;tances wherein, the driving people to the la&s;t &s;treights, and put|ting them under the tuition of &s;uch a ma&s;ter as ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity, has taught them inventions, and excited them to indu&s;try, which have compa&s;&s;ed things, as much regretted at la&s;t, as they were unfore&s;een at fir&s;t,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">An account of European &s;ettlements in America, vol. 2. page 179.</NOTE></P>
<P>Let every true friend then, in the righteous cau&s;e, promote union, and con&s;cienciou&s;ly avoid every thing that may tend to &s;ubvert it.&mdash; It is very apparent, every artifice is practi&s;ed to divide the colonies among them&s;elves, as a means nece&s;&s;ary to compleat our ruin.&mdash;</P>

<P>On the one hand, to make light of our threatning dangers, would argue &s;tupidity; to &s;ink and faint would argue criminal timidity on the other, enervate every &s;pring of action, invite and ha&s;ten on the very <HI>death</HI> we fear. There are many things, after all, that wear an encouraging a&s;pect, for be&s;ides that we have no rea&s;on to doubt of the righteou&s;ne&s;s of our cau&s;e, we have many worthy patrons beyond the Atlantic, who have generou&s;ly e&s;pou&s;ed, and nobly plead, and no doubt will per&s;everingly exert their abilities in our cau&s;e.</P>
<P>Among our&s;elves, a &s;urpri&s;ing union, and that firm re&s;olution which breathes the &s;ame &s;pirit that re&s;ted on our fathers, influenced them to encounter and vanqui&s;h the greate&s;t deaths and dangers, in this, then, an inho&s;pitable wilderne&s;s, in order to purcha&s;e, and leave &s;ecured to us, a mo&s;t invaluable inheritance, too precious in it&s;elf, too dearly bought to be given up on any terms what&s;oever, much le&s;s not to be exchanged for the vile&s;t &s;lavery.

This (Heaven be thanked) has hitherto been the ca&s;e, and in him we hope will be, though we &s;hould be called to &s;pill our blood in our own defence, &s;hould there be need. Then, let <HI>The hands that hang down be lifted up, and the feeble knees &s;trengthened.</HI>&mdash;But our main &s;up|port and confidence is in him <HI>who looketh down from Heaven, and behold|eth all the &s;ons of men,</HI> is able and ready to vindicate the cau&s;e of &s;uf|fering innocency, <HI>di&s;appoint the devices of the crafty, &s;o that their hands cannot perform their enterpri&s;e, and the council of the froward he carrieth headlong.</HI> Let us not be di&s;mayed, but come and take &s;helter under the <HI>wings of the Almighty, ca&s;t our cares on him,</HI> for <HI>He careth foru.</HI> Mmany a time has he appeared in the mount of difficulty, re&s;cued our nati|on, and this land e&s;pecially, from the very brink of ruin.

would fail me to mention the in&s;tances of this which our fathers have told us, and which we have &s;een with our eyes: Let us <HI>Stand firm in the liberty wherewith we have been made free, while we wait for thy &s;al|vation,</HI> O GOD! <HI>as they that watch for the morning!

<P>And in order to increa&s;e and e&s;tabli&s;h us in &s;uch a humble tru&s;t in GOD, as may afford a well-grounded a&s;&s;urance of &s;ucce&s;s, it becomes us to &s;earch and try our hearts and ways, which have not been right in the &s;ight of the Lord, and with true penitency to turn to him. Which is the other remark I would make&mdash;Have we not by our uni|ver&s;al declen&s;ions, manifold offences, abu&s;e of divine ble&s;&s;ings, pro|voked GOD into this &s;evere controver&s;y?</P>
<P>This was the cau&s;e of the people's di&s;tre&s;s, mentioned in the text: this they frankly acknowledge, in their public confe&s;&s;ions, prayers and humiliation; and for us not to own it in ours, would argue a dan|gerous and criminal &s;tupidity: By the be&s;t accounts, we are a&s;&s;ured, that in <HI>England,</HI> at this day, prevails a mo&s;t awful pro&s;tration of all public, &s;ocial virtue, and the peculiar graces of chri&s;tianity, and a fearful prevalence of all kinds of immorality, neglect of GOD, con|tempt of &s;acred things, and the vile&s;t abu&s;e of divine mercy and pa|tience;&mdash;a growing debauchery, di&s;&s;ipation and venality. Very af|fecting are the accounts we have, concerning the declining &s;tate of religion, in <HI>England,</HI> and the awful prevalence of all kinds of wick|edne&s;s; and it were to be wi&s;hed, a heavy charge did not lie again&s;t this country: But, with blu&s;hing, we mu&s;t confe&s;s the contrary. As it concerns the continent in general, to con&s;ider, and be greatly affected in this matter; &s;o it becomes us, in this highly favoured colony, to enquire for our&s;elves. We have been di&s;tingui&s;hed in religious and civil advantages:&mdash;The Chri&s;tian in&s;titution, the la&s;t, and be&s;t ex|hibition of the covenant of grace, we enjoy in its purity and &s;im|plicity, and may truly &s;ay, we have the be&s;t religion in the world, free from &s;uper&s;tition in its appointments in the holy Sabbaths, &s;a|craments and mini&s;try, and as free from eccle&s;ia&s;tical tyranny and per&s;ecution. We have al&s;o a civil con&s;titution, in the hands of good men, the be&s;t calculated to &s;ecure our civil liberties: We make our own laws, choo&s;e our own rulers, and manage our own political mat|ters among our&s;elves. Such indeed has been our happy &s;ituation, that GOD may ju&s;tly &s;ay concerning us, <HI>What more could I have done for my vineyard that I have not done in it?</HI> And it were to be wi&s;hed, we had not given him ju&s;t occa&s;ion to challenge upon us, <HI>Wherefore, when

<P>Let us a&s;k, then, what our temper and treatment has been toward GOD, our <HI>rulers,</HI> our <HI>mini&s;ters,</HI> and one another in private life? Have we not <HI>for&s;aken the</HI> GOD <HI>of our fathers, and lightly e&s;teemed the rock of our &s;alvation?</HI> abu&s;ed his patience, de&s;pi&s;ed his threatnings, contem|ned his authority, and trampled his laws into the mire? Have we not profaned his Sabbaths, trifled with his ordinances and holy &s;a|craments, and &s;aid, <HI>practically, Depart from us, for we de&s;ire not the knowledge of thy ways.</HI></P>
<P>How have we treated our rulers? Have no groundle&s;s jealou&s;ies been indulged, unrea&s;onable clamours rai&s;ed and propagated, at real or &s;uppo&s;ed mi&s;takes, di&s;hone&s;t intrigues practi&s;ed, to the injury, per|haps, of as wi&s;e and good men as ever &s;erved our <HI>republic</HI>?</P>
<P>Have we highly e&s;teemed the <HI>Me&s;&s;engers of the Lord of Ho&s;ts, for their work's &s;ake,</HI> and <HI>obeyed the voice of our teachers</HI>?</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to one another, as individuals, have things <HI>hone&s;t, virtuous, ju&s;t, benevolent, and of good report,</HI> been approved and prac|ti&s;ed? How it is, and has been, with us, in the&s;e re&s;pects, perhaps it is better each one &s;hould enquire than I &s;hould &s;ay&mdash;&s;o far as we are, or have been culpable in tho&s;e regards, we are to con&s;ider our|&s;elves, as having procured the tokens of the divine di&s;plea&s;ure we feel and fear. If we are not careful, therefore, by deep penitency, and univer&s;al amendment, to put away whatever is ami&s;s among us, we can never have a well-grounded confidence in GOD, for his decla|rations are, <HI>Amend your ways and your doings, and I will cau&s;e you to dwell in this place,</HI> otherwi&s;e, <HI>I will do unto the place which I gave unto you, and unto your fathers, as I have done to</HI> Shiloh&mdash;<HI>I will ca&s;t you out of my &s;ight.</HI> Jer. viii.3, 14, 15.</P>

<P><HI>May it plea&s;e your Honor, and the other Gentlemen of the General Court.</HI></P>
<P>You &s;ee the di&s;tre&s;s we are in, the thicke&s;t cloud we ever &s;aw now impends our nation, and wears the mo&s;t threatning a&s;pect on the&s;e American colonies. You are rai&s;ed to places of public tru&s;t, at a mo&s;t important cri&s;is. The mo&s;t vigorous exertion of your be&s;t abilities, in the defence of the liberties and privileges of your country, again&s;t lawle&s;s power, and tyrannical encroachments, are called for.</P>
<P>We doubt not you have a pungent &s;en&s;e of the common misfor|tunes of the day, and in a view of them are ready to break forth in that patriotic language, <HI>O</HI> &s;uffering and oppre&s;&s;ed <HI>Jeru&s;alem! We

<P>In confidence of your un&s;haken attachment to the religion and li|berties of your country, the eyes of all this people wait on you as the guardians, under GOD, of their injured and endangered rights. While you lead in our public affairs, the people, we tru&s;t, will fol|low and &s;upport you, in every wi&s;e method you &s;hall concert for the public &s;afety, at the ri&s;k of their lives and fortunes; for they have <HI>Strengthened their hands to this good work</HI>; and the &s;pirit they are of is properly expre&s;&s;ed in the language of the text, <HI>Come, let us build and be no more a reproach</HI>: You will then encourage your hearts, and the hearts of the people, with a &s;pirit like that of this Jewi&s;h ruler, in the text. You will ri&s;e &s;uperior to every danger and temptation, and di&s;|play a noble fortitude in &s;o righteous a cau&s;e, and &s;o <HI>good a work</HI>; no doubt every valuable accompli&s;hment you are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of, as men, chri&s;tians and rulers, will be &s;ufficiently put to trial, e&s;pecially your <HI>wi&s;dom, prudence</HI> and <HI>firmne&s;s.</HI> Stimulated from a regard to the glory of GOD, a pro&s;pect of being in&s;trumental of delivering your country, &s;ecuring to your&s;elves, your people, and future po&s;terity, the mo&s;t va|luable po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions that are &s;truck at, you will exhibit &s;pecimens of zeal, con&s;tancy, integrity, and per&s;evering re&s;olution: Hereby, at lea&s;t, you will &s;ecure the plea&s;ures of &s;elf-approbation, the te&s;timony of your con&s;tituents, and the final plaudit of your Supreme Judge.</P>
<P>[The example from whence we have &s;pecified the qualifications of men much needed in public &s;tations at this &s;ea&s;on will have its proper influence with you.]</P>
<P>The people re&s;t entirely &s;atisfied in the mea&s;ures that have already been taken, for the common &s;ecurity, in the late dangerous times, and I pre&s;ume I may, in the name of the public, return thanks to the A&s;&s;embly, in particular, for their care to put the militia into a pro|per condition, and to revive a martial &s;pirit. If this be pur&s;ued, we &s;hall, no doubt, in a little time, be able to make a very re&s;pectable figure that way. An approved author, years ago, &s;peaking of <HI>New-England,</HI> &s;aid, "and certainly if tho&s;e men were &s;omewhat regularly trained, it would be impo&s;&s;ible to find, in any country, or at any time, antient or modern, an army better con&s;tituted than that which <HI>New-England</HI> can afford."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Page 643 of <HI>Guthrie</HI> continued.</NOTE> What would the &s;ame writer have &s;aid on a view of our pre&s;ent numbers, and &s;urpri&s;ing improvement, in the military art?</P>

<P>Religion and public virtue, in every view, are objects of the high|e&s;t importance; they will therefore command your fir&s;t and greate&s;t attention: Your power, and the influence of your example, will be employed to encourage religion, and every &s;ocial virtue; to &s;up|pre&s;s vice and immorality, in whatever form they may appear.&mdash;We a&s;k your influence for the &s;upport and encouragement of a pious and learned Mini&s;try.&mdash;The College in this colony we al&s;o recommend to your patronage.&mdash;That &s;eminary has flouri&s;hed of late, notwith|&s;tanding, I am told, its funds are low, and on that account &s;uffers.&mdash; Could &s;upplies be handed in, for the repairs of its buildings, and the better &s;upport of its in&s;tructors, it would be rendered a greater ble&s;&s;|ing to Church and State.&mdash;The public are under obligations grate|fully to acknowlege the goodne&s;s of the General A&s;&s;embly, in pa&s;t favours for the encouragement of inferior &s;chools, the good effects, of which are pretty generally felt; could any thing farther be done at pre&s;ent, it would be a public benefit.&mdash;</P>

<P>In the next place, this addre&s;s is directed to, My <HI>Fathers</HI> and <HI>Brethren</HI> in the Mini&s;try.</P>
<P>Such are the alarming a&s;pects of Divine Providence, at this day, as in all rea&s;on &s;hould rou&s;e us to a mo&s;t painful application in the great and arduous tru&s;t committed to us.&mdash;As members of commu|nity, our intere&s;ts are at &s;take as well as others&mdash;whatever, therefore, is proper for us to do in our places, &s;hould be diligently attended to; we &s;hould encourage our people, and animate them to &s;tand firm in the liberties wherewith GOD, NATURE, and CHRISTIANITY have made them FREE, and never thro' fear of &s;uffering lo&s;s, or any temptation, ba&s;ely give up the rights of Men and Chri&s;tians; for, as on the one hand, he that in this way, <HI>&s;hall &s;eek to &s;ave his life, &s;hall lo&s;e it</HI>; &s;o on the other, <HI>he that &s;hall lo&s;e his life,</HI> in religiou&s;ly &s;upporting &s;o good a cau&s;e, <HI>&s;hall find it,</HI> and in the end <HI>&s;hall receive an hundred fold.</HI></P>
