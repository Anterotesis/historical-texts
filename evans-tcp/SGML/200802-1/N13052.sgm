<BIBL>PSALM cxxiv. 2, 3, 6.</BIBL>
<Q><HI>If it had not been the Lord who was on our Side, when Men ro&s;e up again&s;t us; then they had &s;wallowed us up quick, when their Wrath was kindled again&s;t us.</HI>&mdash;<HI>Ble&s;&s;ed be the Lord, who hath not given us as a Prey to their Teeth.</HI></Q>

<P>IT is a bu&s;ine&s;s entertaining and u&s;eful, to recount the dealings and di&s;pen&s;ations of divine providence towards a people. Such an employ has a tendency to rai&s;e our wonder and admiration, and excite our gratitude. To be in&s;en&s;ible of and unaffected with divine di&s;pen&s;ations, is an evidence of the ba&s;ene&s;s and wretched depravity of human nature. Mercies and afflictions oftentimes produce the mo&s;t valuable pur|po&s;es. God draws his people with cords of a man, with bands of love, Ho&s;. xi. 4. tho divine beneficenes having &s;uch an effect upon creatures capable of love, and &s;u&s;ceptible of gratitude, that the prophet calls them cords of a man. Adver&s;e and afflictive providences an|&s;wer various important ends and purpo&s;es. The pious P&s;almi&s;t &s;ays, before I was afflicted I went a&s;tray; but now have I kept thy word, P&s;al. cxix. 67. They are of u&s;e to alarm the &s;ecure,&mdash;to humble the proud,&mdash;to reclaim the wandering,&mdash;to heighten the worth of mer|cies, and excite the gratitude of tho&s;e for whom provi|dence has wrought &s;alvation.</P>
<P>Thus we find good men in all ages have, after mani|fe&s;t &s;ignal deliverances, made their returns of thank&s;|giving and prai&s;e. I&s;rael did thus after their wonderful and miraculous deliverance from the cruel hand of the Egyptians: when they &s;aw that great work which the Lord did upon Egypt, they feared the Lord, and be|lieved the Lord, and his &s;ervant Mo&s;es. Then Mo&s;es and the children of I&s;rael &s;ong a &s;ong unto the Lord, as in the 15th of Exod. This was an argument Mo&s;es often made u&s;e of to excite the obedience and gratitude
<PB N="4" REF="016509_0002_0FAFE8F0AA217A08">
of the people of I&s;rael. Samuel, that he might effect the &s;ame de&s;ign, gives I&s;rael a brief retro&s;pect of the great things God had done for their fathers, e&s;pecially in their deliverance from Egypt, with a mighty hand and an out&s;tretched arm, and planting them in a land flowing with milk and honey, the glory of all lands. And afterwards, when they fold <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> into the hands of their enemies, he rai&s;ed up for them deliverers, whereby they were re&s;cued out of the hand of their enemies on every &s;ide:&mdash;To &s;um up the matter, he tells them to fear the Lord, and to &s;erve him in truth, with all the heart, and to con&s;ider the great things G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> had done for them, 1 Sam. xii. 6. David reminds them of former kindne&s;&s;es, to awaken their gratitude and engage their obedience. We have heard with our ears, O God, our fathers have told, what work thou did&s;t in their days, in times of old, P&s;al. xliv. nor is he le&s;s mind|ful of the fre&s;her in&s;tances of the divine goodne&s;s:&mdash;O! that men would prai&s;e the Lord, for his goodne&s;s en|dures for ever.</P>
<P>The p&s;alm, in which the words of our text is con|tained, celebrates the divine goodne&s;s to the church. It is &s;uppo&s;ed to be compo&s;ed by David, in the name and for the u&s;e of the church and people of I&s;rael, as a thank&s;giving for their deliverance from &s;ome imminent danger or dangers, from proud and powerful enemies. Many &s;uch they had in David's time, but which of them are here intended, is hard to determine, nor is it nece&s;&s;ary for us to enquire.</P>
<P>The words of our text &s;uppo&s;e the people of I&s;rael in|volved in &s;ome very great di&s;tre&s;&s;es, which were oc|ca&s;ioned by &s;ome very powerful enemy, who had threatened and attempted their ruin and overthrow, and from who&s;e malicious de&s;igns they were not &s;uffi|cient to deliver them&s;elves. Their wrath was cruel, and their fury burned with irre&s;i&s;tible vengeance, &s;o that they mu&s;t have been &s;wallowed up by them, had not the Lord of ho&s;ts, the God of the armies of I&s;rael, appear|ed to vindicate their righteous cau&s;e, and &s;ave them from threatened ruin. They were &s;en&s;ible of their weak and defencele&s;s condition, that their deliverance was not

of them&s;elves, their own arm did not &s;ave them, but the right hand and mighty arm of God;&mdash;therefore they &s;ay, had not the Lord been on their &s;ide, they had been &s;wallowed up quick. They return a tribute of prai&s;e to him who rideth in the heavens for their help, who&s;e excellency is in the &s;kies; ble&s;&s;ed be the name of the Lord.</P>
<P>The words may, without any force or &s;train, be ap|plied to the &s;tate and circum&s;tances of the people of this land. Our di&s;tre&s;&s;es have been great, but our deli|verances have &s;urpa&s;&s;ed them. With the P&s;almi&s;t, &s;peak|ing in the name of I&s;rael, we may &s;ay, many times turned he his anger, and did not &s;tir up all his wrath, P&s;al. 1xx viii. 38. And with Nehemiah, ix. 28, many times did&s;t thou deliver them, becau&s;e of thy mercies. For his name &s;ake he has deferred his anger, and for his promi&s;e has he refrained for us, that he hath not cut us off, I&s;a. xIviii. 9. He hath done great things for his people, for which they have rea&s;on to rejoice and be glad. Our fathers tru&s;ted in thee, they tru&s;ted in thee, and were delivered.</P>
<P>That we may &s;ee wherein God has appeared for the help of the people in this land, let us take a brief view of the innumerable di&s;tre&s;&s;es and difficulties they have been called to encounter, out of which a wi&s;e and gra|cious God has marvelou&s;ly delivered them. They got not the land by their own &s;word, neither did their own arm &s;ave them, but thy right hand, and thine arm, and the light of thy countenance&punc; becau&s;e thou ha&s;t a favour unto them, I&s;a. xliv. 3. That they have not &s;tood by their own might, but that God has been on their &s;ide, is evident, if we con&s;ider their weakne&s;s and inability to encounter the many and great difficulties that lay in their way.</P>
<P>In the reign of James the fir&s;t of England, 1602, there were a number of godly per&s;ons in the &s;everal towns and villages in Nottingham&s;hire, Lanca&s;hire and York&s;hire, in the north of England, who were zealous for reforma|tion, not only te&s;tifying again&s;t human inventions and additions, in the wor&s;hip of God, but carefully attending to the po&s;itive and practical <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of divine <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">

entered into an agreement for the &s;upport of the wor|&s;hip and ordinances of God, according to the primitive pattern. And finding by experience that they could not enjoy their liberties and privileges without offence, in their own country, they determined to remove them|&s;elves and families into the Netherlands, which they after &s;ome difficulty accompli&s;hed; and arriving in Hol|land, they &s;ettled them&s;elves in the city of Leyden, 1610; here, under the States, they quietly enjoyed their liber|ties about ten years, Mr. Prince &s;ays eleven: But think|ing Holland not the mo&s;t advantageous place for them and their po&s;terity, they, after &s;erious delibera|tion, determined to remove to America&mdash;Matters being prepared, they &s;at &s;ail Augu&s;t 20, and arrived at Cape Cod the 11th day of November, 1620: After recon|noitering the &s;hores, they landed December 25, at a place they called, after the name of the company under who&s;e patronage they came, Plymouth. Here they found them&s;elves in a wild inho&s;pitable wilderne&s;s, without friends, and &s;urrounded with enemies, in an inclement &s;ea&s;on, without an hou&s;e to &s;helter them, or fortre&s;s to &s;ecure them from the rage of a &s;avage foe, or &s;ufficient provi&s;ion to relieve the returns of hunger; few in num|ber (about an hundred) yea very few, and &s;trangers in a land unknown. Of their &s;mall number one half died before the opening of the &s;pring, by rea&s;on of the hard|&s;hips they had undergone, which produced &s;curveys, &amp;c. that awfully dimini&s;hed their numbers; and many more, if not all, mu&s;t have peri&s;hed with famine, had not God provided for them the fi&s;h of the &s;ea, and the trea&s;ures hid in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">.</P>

Such was the care of God for them, that they neither peri&s;hed by famine, nor were de&s;troyed by the bow or &s;word of the wilderne&s;s. Their nece&s;&s;ities God &s;upplied out of his inexhau&s;ted trea&s;ure, and their &s;afety he guarded by the &s;trength of his arm. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> round about them to be at peace;

and &s;everal of their &s;achems &s;oon de&s;ired and &s;ought their protection. Such was the beginning of New England.</P>
<P>It was not long after that new adventurers arrived from time to time, &s;o that in the &s;pace of a few years the&s;e four governments were con&s;iderably peopled.</P>
<P>The natives being alarmed at their rapid increa&s;e, combined to cut them off, and in &s;everal engagements they &s;ucceeded in their enterprizes, e&s;pecially under Philip, the renowned Indian warrior. But under the kind &s;miles of heaven our feeble tribes prevented them, and di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them of their territories. For many years they made inroads and depredations upon our frontiers, by burning, captivating and de&s;troying, in a &s;urprizing manner; the tender mother, with the infant babe, did not e&s;cape their helli&s;h rage, malice and cruelty. But God, in his abundant goodne&s;s, was plea&s;ed to pre&s;erve his people, and protected the vine his own right hand had planted, when men ro&s;e up again&s;t it; he has prevented them from being &s;wallowed up; he has made them to encrea&s;e and multiply, and driven out the heathen be|fore them, &s;o that they are become a great and mighty people. From the &s;mall beginning of &s;carce fifty, that remained after the great mortality that prevailed among them, their numbers <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> grown to about half a million, that we might &s;et up our Ebenezer, and &s;ay, hitherto the Lord hath helped us. The Lord hath comforted Zion, even all her wa&s;te places, made her wilderne&s;s like Eden, and her de&s;ert like the garden of the Lord; joy and gladne&s;s hath been found therein, thank&s;giving, and the voice of melody, I&s;a. li. 3.</P>
<P>It would be too tedious, at this time, to take even a brief notice of the many &s;ignal in&s;tances of the interpo&s;i|tions of divine providence in favour of his people in this land. There were many in&s;tances when they were on the brink of ruin, when every appearance was dark and gloomy. Even then &s;ome unfore&s;een deliverance and &s;alvation was de&s;igned, and conferred upon them. Their &s;truggles and di&s;tre&s;&s;es were great, but God had mercy for them, and remembered them in their low e&s;tate, and redeemed them from the hand of their enemies,
<PB N="8" REF="016509_0004_0FAFE8F204C72118">
P&s;al. lxxvi. 23, 24. In how many bloody and cruel wars were they engaged with the &s;avages of the wilder|ne&s;s; their land made an aceldama, a field of blood? What de&s;olations were there made upon them? Towns laid in a&s;hes, their inhabitants mo&s;t inhumanly butchered, without di&s;tinction of age or &s;ex.</P>
<P>And when the &s;cene of affairs &s;eemed to have been happily changed, and we were ready to flatter our&s;elves with halcyon days, days of peace and tranquility, e&s;pe|cially on the conclu&s;ion of the la&s;t war, in 1763, Canada being &s;ubdued, and the &s;avages brought into &s;ubjection; &s;oon after peace was re&s;tored between the contending powers, a new &s;torm began to gather, heaven lowered with vengeance, an unthought of enemy appeared to be ri&s;ing up, both for our cha&s;ti&s;ement and profit, to humble us for manifold crying &s;ins, and to open a way for our greater enlargement, and more free enjoyment of the natural rights of mankind.</P>
<P>Though Great-Britain had been &s;miled upon in a very uncommon manner, in the pro&s;ecution of the war &s;he had been engaged in with France and Spain, and con|cluded a peace to the enlargement of the Briti&s;h empire in America; and though in the conte&s;t the Americans had been much engaged, and afforded &s;upplies, both with re&s;pect to men and money, much beyond their due proportion, the king and parliament them&s;elves being Judges, for they freely refunded large &s;ums in requital; yet their re&s;tle&s;s, ambitious, domineering tempers would not permit them to be ea&s;y and quiet, when it was much their intere&s;t to be &s;o: Therefore, no &s;ooner were they relea&s;ed from the calamities of a war with foreign na|tions, than they were meditating the mo&s;t unnatural and impoveri&s;hing one; that is, tho&s;e mea&s;ures, which it was fore&s;een mu&s;t terminate in civil di&s;&s;entions, and violent ho&s;tilities.</P>
<P>The mea&s;ures adopted by the king, and his venal mi|ni&s;ters, were &s;uch as impo&s;ing duties for the purpo&s;e of rai&s;ing a revenue in America, and extending the powers of courts of admiralty beyond their antient limits, de|priving the American &s;ubjects of trials by jury, allow|ing the judges certificate to indemnify the pro&s;ecutor from damages that he might otherwi&s;e be liable to, &amp;c.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="016509_0004_0FAFE8F204C72118">
Not content with the&s;e amazing &s;trides, the next year an act was pa&s;&s;ed, known by the name of the &s;tamp-act. This gave a mo&s;t terrible alarm through this exten&s;ive continent, and rouzed every &s;oul with zeal to &s;tand forth and a&s;&s;ert their rights. The union and firmne&s;s of the people, by the ble&s;&s;ing of God, proved the happy means of their re&s;cue from threatened va&s;&s;alage. This ob|noxious act was the next &s;e&s;&s;ions of Parliament repealed, to the very great joy of the inhabitants of America. Though this act was cruel and unju&s;t, yet its repeal was not becau&s;e it was an unrea&s;onable claim, but becau&s;e, as its preamble &s;ays, the continuance thereof would be at|tended with many inconveniences, and might be pro|ductive of con&s;equences greatly detrimental to the com|mercial intere&s;ts of Great-Britain.</P>
<P>There were &s;everal &s;ub&s;equent acts made, which might have rea&s;onably alarmed the Americans; &s;uch as, that his Maje&s;ty in Parliament of right had power to bind the people of America by &s;tatute, in all ca&s;es what&s;o|ever. And in the following year (1767) an act pa&s;&s;ed, enabling his Maje&s;ty to put the cu&s;toms and other duties in America under the management of commi&s;|&s;ioners, &amp;c. Thereupon he erected the then exten|&s;ive board of commi&s;&s;ioners, for the expre&s;s purpo&s;e of carrying into execution the &s;everal acts relating to the revenue and trade of America.</P>
<P>Upon the repeal of the &s;tamp-act, the people of Ame|rica mo&s;t gratefully acknowledged the favour and kind providence of God, who&s;e government is over all.</P>
<P>And as they had received &s;uch a token for good, they did not di&s;quiet them&s;elves, or others, in relation to the other unju&s;t claims, but flattered them&s;elves with hopes of a more exten&s;ive change of mea&s;ures, and that every grievance might in due time be removed out of the way. But admini&s;tration, ever re&s;tle&s;s for effecting their purpo&s;es, did, by a &s;tatute called the gla&s;s, paper, and tea act, made ab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">t fifteen months after the repeal of the &s;tamp-act&punc; re&s;ume their former language, and again undertook to give and grant rates and duties to be paid, in what they called the Colonies, for the expre&s;s purpo&s;e of rai&s;ing a revenue, to defray the charges of the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice, the &s;upport
<PB N="10" REF="016509_0005_0FAFE8F2C26B4B10">
of civil government, and defence of the king's domi|nions on this continent.</P>
<P>The&s;e and &s;uch like acts, made and pa&s;&s;ed, revived the apprehen&s;ions and di&s;contents which had en|tirely &s;ub&s;ided, by the repeal of the &s;tamp-act. Thus they went on to irritate the inhabitants of this continent. To fix the chains they had prepared, the mini&s;try agreed with the Ea&s;t-India company to &s;end over to America large quantities of tea, that they might have an opportunity of carrying their mea&s;ures into execution.</P>
<P>Various methods were projected to avoid the blow. That which was &s;ent to Carolina was &s;tored, and as effectually <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t to the company as though it had been burnt. That which was &s;ent to New-York was re|turned. And that which was &s;ent to Bo&s;ton, was, by rea&s;on of the Governor's refu&s;ing to give a permit for its being &s;ent back, thrown into the &s;ea. Whereupon the charter of the province was vacated, the town blocked up with &s;hips of war, a &s;tanding army kept to awe the inhabitants into &s;ubjection, and all trade entirely pre|vented; every &s;ource for &s;upport was dried up, and thou&s;ands &s;uffering for the nece&s;&s;aries of life.</P>
<P>The&s;e things began to awaken the attention of all the inhabitants of this land, though comparatively lit|tle preparation was made to repel force by force, be|cau&s;e we were unwilling to break with a people with whom we had long been connected; and therefore were trying, by the mo&s;t humble petitions and remon|&s;trances, to prevent the threatened vengeance. But all was vain, our cries could not be heard, or our petitions regarded, but &s;hut out as unworthy of the lea&s;t notice; rather in&s;ulted were we in our mo&s;t &s;ervent &s;upplica|tions. While thus begging and imploring royal favour and clemency, a few provincial or county &s;tores being collected at Concord, General Gage detached a party of about 1000 men, under the command of Colonel Smith, who in the evening preceding the 19th of April, 1775, &s;ecretly &s;at out with a de&s;ign of taking and de&s;troying the above mentioned &s;tores. Coming to Lexington, they found a number of inoffen&s;ive pea&s;ants together, upon
<PB N="11" REF="016509_0005_0FAFE8F2C26B4B10">
whom they fired, killed and wounded 17 (8 killed and 9 wounded.) They then pu&s;hed on for Concord; by the time they could reach the de&s;tined place, the inha|bitants in that vicinity were alarmed, collected together, and proceeded to the bridge, when the king's troops fir&s;t fired upon them, which was returned with a mar|tial bravery and intrepidity, which obliged tho&s;e ve|terans to retreat with precipitation, and though reinforced by Lord Percy with 1400 men, they were glad to find them&s;elves once more &s;ecure in Bo&s;ton, while all the way thither they were falling by their pur&s;uers. This was the fir&s;t commencement of ho&s;tilities.</P>
<P>Here let us reflect upon the goodne&s;s of God to his peo|ple: They were attacked &s;ecretly&punc; by an enemy &s;killed in the art of war, who had been often flu&s;hed with victory, equipped with arms, and every accoutrement of war; an army regularly officered and di&s;ciplined.&mdash;While we, on our part, were without officers, without men, arms or ammunition, in all re&s;pects unprepared for the field; yet weak and defencele&s;s as we were, our enemy was made to flee before us. Surely we cannot a&s;cribe it to our &s;kill in war, or preparation for the field, but mu&s;t &s;ay it was becau&s;e the Lord was on our &s;ide, who has the hearts of all in his hands, and can ea&s;ily intimidate them, and &s;trike them with &s;uch a panic that they cannot face their oppo&s;ers. Mu&s;t not we a&s;cribe the glory to him, who is the Lord of ho&s;ts, the God of armies, when a company of raw, undi&s;ciplined and irregular men, are able to op|po&s;e and put to flight an equal if not &s;uperior number of troops, under experienced officers, and who had been trained up to the u&s;e of arms? Had we been to judge of things, according to the common influence of cau&s;es and effects, we could have expected nothing &s;hort of a mo&s;t terrible carnage.&mdash;And had General Gage at that &s;ea&s;on drawn out his whole force, what terrible wa&s;te and de&s;truction might he have made, e&s;pecially for a &s;ea&s;on? Seven or eight thou&s;and regular troops, with a fine ar|tillery, might have laid wa&s;te, to a con&s;iderable extent, a fertile plea&s;ant land. But heaven re&s;trained their madne&s;s, till there was time to form &s;ome more regular means to oppo&s;e them.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="016509_0006_0FAFE8F382994C68">
Their defeated &s;cattered legions with ha&s;ty &s;teps return|ed to Bo&s;ton, where, with their whole army, they were &s;hut up, and &s;trongly fortified.</P>
<P>The&s;e acts of ho&s;tility &s;o alarmed the country, that there was very &s;oon an army of Provincials rai&s;ed in the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts and neighbouring Colonies, with a view to prevent any further excur&s;ions of our common enemy. It is here worthy of notice, that though a con&s;iderable body of men were rai&s;ed, there was no one man that had the command of the whole: Though there was a fir&s;t in every Colony, there was no one that could claim a right of &s;uperintending the different divi&s;ions of the different Colonies; which greatly prevented the order and regularity of the army, and rendered them le&s;s for|midable, and more expo&s;ed by any attack their enemy might make upon them. This di&s;advantage was com|plained of, by &s;ome of their be&s;t officers, and afterwards experienced much to their di&s;advantage, e&s;pecially in the affair of Bunker Hill.</P>
<P>Amid&s;t every di&s;advantage, they conducted with as much decorum as their &s;ituation would admit of, and a &s;pirit and bravery that their circum&s;tances required. That they were endowed with a true martial &s;pirit, they gave the be&s;t evidence of on the 17th of June, 1775, when near 2000 of them began an entrenchment on Bunker-Hill, which the royal army perceiving, &s;ent out double, if not treble their numbers, to di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s them of the ground, which brought on a mo&s;t ob&s;tinate and bloody engagement; when near 1000, &s;ome &s;ay 1500, of our enemy were killed and wounded: Though, being overpowered by numbers, we retreated to Cambridge, with a lo&s;s comparatively incon&s;iderable (about 100 killed and died of their wounds.)</P>
<P>Perhaps the event of this engagement had been much more favourable, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> there been a proper officer, who&s;e authority had been more exten&s;ive: For where there is a timidity, as is natural in a &s;ituation of danger, men will be very apt to indulge it, where they imagine there is a want of right or authority to challenge their &s;ervices.</P>
<P>The difficulty referred to was happily remedied, by the appointment of Continental officers, and the arrival
<PB N="13" REF="016509_0006_0FAFE8F382994C68">
of the Commander in Chief of all the forces of the United States of America, his Excellency General Wa&s;h|ington; under who&s;e con&s;ummate wi&s;dom our military affairs have been conducted; who&s;e name is dear and highly venerated, and who&s;e memory will, I tru&s;t, be ever precious in the e&s;teem of every friend of America. This celebrated officer took the command of our troops at Cambridge on the 2d day of July, 1775.</P>
<P>Although this attempt did not &s;ucceed, as was de&s;ired and hoped, yet it an&s;wered important ends and pur|po&s;es; it &s;hewed us that our help was not in our&s;elves, and that the providence of God was eminently concern|ed in the pre&s;ervation of this detached party, that they were not cut off by much &s;uperior numbers. It al&s;o afforded matter of conviction to our enemies that we were in earne&s;t, and would contend even to blood, in the defence of our rights and privileges: Be&s;ides it weak|ened and di&s;pirited our enemies, &s;o that they thought it be&s;t to confine them&s;elves afterwards to their &s;trong ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">s, and content them&s;elves with throwing their &s;hot and &s;hells at &s;o great a di&s;tance as gave little pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s. And thus the remaining part of that year was principally &s;pent, and until the month of March fol|lowing, when, by the be&s;t accounts we were able to collect, they were meditating an attack upon our army; being provoked thereto by our taking po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of the heights of Dorche&s;ter.</P>
<P>The day the important attempt was to have been made, God, who commands the winds and &s;eas, &s;ent &s;uch a terrible tempe&s;t, that the waters were impa&s;&s;able, and their purpo&s;e fru&s;trated. Thus he is able to turn the coun&s;els of the wi&s;e into fooli&s;hne&s;s, and make their de|vices of none effect. He is glorious in holine&s;s, fearful in prai&s;e, doing wonders. How much rea&s;on have we to admire the conduct of divine providence, in re&s;training the wrath and di&s;appointing the purpo&s;es of our enemies, and more &s;o, if we take into con&s;ideration our unpre|paredne&s;s to oppo&s;e our enemies? We were without a re|gular army, un&s;killed in arms, undi&s;ciplined, and in a mea&s;ure unarmed. In this our defencele&s;s condition, our enemies might have taken the advantage; but they
<PB N="14" REF="016509_0007_0FAFE8F442E879F0">
were re&s;trained, which gave us an opportunity of col|lecting forces, and the various nece&s;&s;aries for our de|fence.&mdash;Kind providence di&s;appointing the de&s;igns of our enemies, and finding their &s;ituation un&s;afe while our forces occupied the above mentioned heights, they, like men &s;eized with a panic, ha&s;tily &s;hip them&s;elves, that they may e&s;cape the danger, March 18, 1776. May we not then adopt the words of the pious P&s;almi&s;t, and &s;ay, had not the Lord been on our &s;ide, when men ro&s;e up again&s;t us, they had &s;wallowed us up quick?</P>
<P>But to &s;hew their rancour and malice upon their di&s;|appointment, they left fire in a number of hou&s;es, in &s;uch a po&s;ition that it might &s;oon be communicated, and produce a mo&s;t fearful de&s;olation through every &s;treet and lane in the town: But kind providence directed the inhabitants to a timely di&s;covery of the horrid mali|cious plot; and thereby the mo&s;t calamitous conflagra|tion, intended and threatened that once opulent and flouri&s;hing town, was prevented.</P>
<P>Ble&s;s the Lord, who hath not given us as a prey to their teeth. Our &s;oul is e&s;caped as a bird out of the &s;nare of the fowler; the &s;nare is broken, and we are e&s;caped; our help is the name of the Lord, who made heaven and earth.</P>
<P>While the&s;e things were going on, our force in the north was not idle: Ticonderoga was taken by &s;urprize the 9th day of May. This opened a way for our forces to Canada, which for a &s;ea&s;on was improved to advan|tage; Chamblee was &s;oon taken, and St. John's, after a &s;iege of &s;ix weeks, November 2, 1775. Our &s;ucce&s;s &s;oon reached Montreal, and extended to the gates of Quebec. This was an object that commanded the attention of our officers: Accordingly a regiment of men was voluntarily engaged in a rout by way of Kennebec, through the wilderne&s;s, into the heart of Canada, to co-operate with the forces that &s;hould be &s;ent by the way of the lakes. This rout, though attended with amazing difficulty and hard&s;hip, was performed by two parts of the whole, the other returning, by rea&s;on of the &s;carcity of provi&s;ions. Some time after their arrival, they were joined by a party
<PB N="15" REF="016509_0007_0FAFE8F442E879F0">
under the command of General Montgomery, who, after &s;ummoning the city to &s;urrender, and being re|fu&s;ed, attempted to force it, December 31&s;t, in which hazardous enterprize he was &s;lain, and the attempt was defeated. Thus fell that gallant officer, who&s;e me|mory is &s;till venerated, and will be perpetuated in the annals of America. About 370 of our troops were made pri&s;oners.</P>
<P>Though providence did not de&s;ign <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s &s;o great a fa|vour as the acqui&s;ition of that important place, or the continuance of a life &s;o good and great, yet never|thele&s;s we have rea&s;on to acknowledge the kind|ne&s;s of God, the wi&s;e governor of the world, in the pre&s;ervation of &s;o many of our forces, in the mo&s;t criti|cal &s;ituation, and teaching us that wi&s;dom and &s;trength are with God; that we might be taken off from tru&s;t|ing in an arm of fle&s;h, and never go forth in our own &s;trength, but in the name and &s;trength of him who is the God of the armies of I&s;rael.</P>
<P>But to return, our enemy evacuating Bo&s;ton, and re|tiring to Halifax, gave us a further opportunity of re|cruiting, and forming a more regular army; which we may ever con&s;ider as a &s;mile of divine providence, which not only favoured us with an opportunity of doing &s;omething for recruiting and forming an army, but al&s;o for recruiting and augmenting our &s;tores. As we had been deficient in military &s;tores, and the im|portation of them attended with difficulty and great ri&s;que, it was nece&s;&s;ary that we &s;hould, if po&s;&s;ible, do &s;ome|thing for that purpo&s;e among our&s;elves. We therefore &s;oon found we could in a good mea&s;ure &s;upply our&s;elves with cannon and gunpowder, far beyond the mo&s;t &s;anguine expectations. The art of making &s;alt-petre &s;oon ro&s;e to great perfection; a bu&s;ine&s;s that had been little thought of, and le&s;s practi&s;ed, and upon the bare &s;ugge&s;tion of it, many thought it could not be accompli&s;hed.</P>
<P>If it were found that there was a deficiency in our manufactory, that deficiency we could &s;upply from abroad, without the difficulty and ri&s;que of the whole. And be&s;ides, we made captures upon the high &s;eas that were no &s;mall advantage.&mdash;The&s;e things we are ready
<PB N="10" REF="016509_0008_0FAFE8F505D57050">
to a&s;cribe to our&s;elves, our wi&s;dom and &s;agacity, though we are as much indebted to the providence of God for them, as we are for the bread we eat for our nouri&s;h|ment, or the clothes we put on.</P>
<P>If we had but a &s;hort re&s;pite from the immediate view and excur&s;ions of our enemy, it was that we might prepare for more formidable and vigorous attacks. The rod was continually held over us, and we were threaten|ed with every di&s;tre&s;s that was in the power of Great|Britain to inflict: Formidable fleets and armies were pre|paring in Great-Britain, with foreign mercenaries to re|duce this continent to obedience in all ca&s;es what&s;oever.</P>
<P>Accordingly ho&s;tilities were again committed. Com|modore Sir Peter Parker, with his fleet, in conjunction with the army under Generals Cornwallis and Clinton, made a mo&s;t vigorous attack upon Sullivan's-I&s;land, in South-Carolina, the 28th of June, 1776. While the &s;hips drawn up again&s;t the fortre&s;s, with amazing fury and dreadful roar of cannon pour in their &s;hot, attempting its demolition, their army three &s;everal times attempted to land, but were repul&s;ed. Such re|&s;olution and bravery animated both officers and &s;oldiers, that General Lee ob&s;erved there was no need to &s;ay any thing to them, to in&s;pire their ambition, or emulate their activity. Far from being in the lea&s;t di&s;heart|ened by fatigue, they ru&s;hed on in one continued blaze of fire, with thick columns of &s;moke, for the &s;pace of twelve hours, when their enemy was glad to retire, un|der the cover of the night, though &s;o di&s;abled that it was with difficulty they were able to make their retreat. Their &s;hips were much &s;hattered, and many of their officers and men &s;lain and wounded; thus they con|cluded their enterprize. Who was it that taught their hands to war, and their fingers to fight? Who that in|&s;pired them with that noble ardour and fixed re&s;olu|tion, that procured them victory? Might they not &s;ay with David, thou, O Lord, ha&s;t girded me with &s;trength to the battle? ble&s;&s;ed be the Lord, my &s;trength, P&s;al. cxli.</P>

If we dreaded the effects of their wrath, we had no de&s;ponding fears of their &s;ucce&s;s. We were not unapprized that it was in their power to de&s;olate our &s;ea-ports, and they had given us in&s;tances of this kind of &s;avage inhumanity; let Charles|town, Norfolk, Falmouth, &amp;c. witne&s;s.</P>
<P>By this time the people of America had felt enough of the cruelty and inhumanity of Great-Britain, and more they had rea&s;on to expect, it therefore became nece&s;&s;ary to think of &s;ome method whereby they might &s;ecure them&s;elves again&s;t threatened de&s;truction, and tran&s;mit their rights and privileges to po&s;terity. An expedient pre&s;ented, which in its con&s;equences was the mo&s;t favour|able of any that could be thought of, and promi&s;ed the mo&s;t la&s;ting benefits and ble&s;&s;ings, namely, throwing off all connection with Great-Britain; and accordingly the fourth day of July, 1776, is one of the mo&s;t memorable aeras that ever took place in America. Then, to the almo&s;t univer&s;al joy of the inhabitants of this country, we were declared free and independent States. If we are indebted to any man, or any number of men, for going into this method for our help, it mu&s;t be to the Briti&s;h king and his mini&s;ters. I pre&s;ume I may &s;ay, that it was not &s;o much as the wi&s;h or de&s;ire of &s;carce a man on the continent, before their di&s;tre&s;&s;es had driven them to meditate &s;uch an expedient: No, not until after they found that the Briti&s;h king was forming al|liances, and &s;eeking a&s;&s;i&s;tance from foreign powers. We were &s;en&s;ible, that while we were in connection with Great-Britain, it would not be in our power to procure any foreign alliance or a&s;&s;i&s;tance, &s;hould our di&s;tre&s;&s;es be ever &s;o great; we were therefore nece&s;&s;itated by Britain her&s;elf, upon the principles of &s;elf pre&s;ervation, to de|clare our independency. Divine providence made u&s;e of them as the very means of this (to them) &s;o unplea&s;ing

an event. Our enemies have repeatedly thrown out, that it was the object we ever aimed at, which is as far from truth as fal&s;hood it&s;elf can be. If this had been the ca&s;e, why did we delay the matter &s;o long? Why did we remon&s;trate and petition from time to time, in the mo&s;t humble and affectionate manner, by &s;eparate A&s;&s;emblies, and by Delegates in Congre&s;s, for redre&s;s of grievances <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">&punc; Then we &s;hould much rather have been heard, and reverted back to the &s;tate we were in in the year 1763&mdash;But we could not be heard, but were &s;purned from the throne with threats and in&s;ults.

A &s;eries of providences con&s;pired to bring about this glorious event, and at a juncture when it &s;eemed to be the mo&s;t &s;it and nece&s;&s;ary.&mdash;That it &s;hould be accompli&s;hed with &s;uch unanimity and firm|ne&s;s among the members of Congre&s;s, and &s;o prolifical in its con&s;equences, is a peculiar &s;mile of heaven, and &s;hould be acknowledged to the glory of that God who&s;e kingdom is over all, and who di&s;po&s;eth the hearts of men as he plea&s;eth.</P>
<P>But we will proceed to take notice of our danger, and our deliverance. About the beginning of July, 1776. General Howe, with his fleet of men of war and tran&s;|ports, hove in &s;ight of New-York, and &s;oon after landed an army of more than 30,000 men. While his army was airing and recruiting their health and vigour, he pretend|ed to &s;et on foot an accommodation, to which Congre&s;s &s;o far li&s;tened as to appoint a committee of their body to hear the terms to be propo&s;ed. The matter being looked into, it was found but an amu&s;ement, as there were no powers committed to him and his a&s;&s;ociates that could operate to any advantage. Thus ended the treaty, if worthy the name.&mdash;About the 20th of Augu&s;t his men were again &s;hipped, fell down the Narrows, landed near Grave&s;end, and marched through the town of New-Utrecht, in their way to Flat-Bu&s;h, about 5 miles from the city, near which they encamped; but were much harra&s;&s;ed by our rifle-men. Scouting parties were &s;ent
<PB N="19" REF="016509_0009_0FAFE8F5C64F5758">
from our army to the adjoining woods, but their num|bers were in&s;ufficient. The Briti&s;h forces, in three di|vi&s;ions, take three different roads, and under cover of he night almo&s;t &s;urround the whole of our parties, who, though encircled with more than treble their number, bravely fought their way through the enemy (Augu&s;t 27) killing great numbers of them, and carrying off many pri&s;oners. As it was the principal of the Briti&s;h force that was engaged again&s;t only a divi&s;ion of the Ame|rican army, who were &s;tationed upon the we&s;t end of Long-I&s;land, oppo&s;ite to New-York, they found them&s;elves <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">n&s;ufficient to &s;u&s;tain a vigorous attack, yet they were enabled to break the &s;nare and e&s;cape, though many were &s;lain, and numbers captivated. Their ordnance and &s;tores they retreated with to New-York, before the enemy were apprized of their de&s;ign.&mdash;Whatever gloom may be thrown over the mind by the recital of &s;uch a cata&s;trophe, yet there will, upon a review of the matter, appear mercy in the mid&s;t of judgment. We &s;hould acknowledge it to the glory of divine goodne&s;s and mer|cy, that the whole divi&s;ion was not made a &s;acrifice, when their enemy were &s;o numerous, and that we were able to make &s;o favourable a retreat.</P>
<P>The &s;everal &s;kirmi&s;hes which preceded the more general attack &s;erved to weaken the enemy, perhaps, in proportion to any di&s;advantage we &s;uffered. The&s;e out-works and fortre&s;&s;es were principally de&s;igned for temporary u&s;e; they delayed the progre&s;s of the enemy, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 words"> an important end in view. That which they attained in ground, they lo&s;t in time, they being retarded in their motions, and their lo&s;s of time was no doubt our advantage.</P>
<P>However, it gave the enemy the advantage of a more ea&s;y acce&s;s to the city and i&s;land of New-York. This our Generals &s;aw and provided again&s;t, by removing what|ever was mo&s;t valuable out of the way. On the 15th day of September they landed, under a heavy fire of cannon from their &s;hipping, at or near the town of Harlem, and while they entered the city one way, our forces retreat|ed the other. Being now on a &s;mall i&s;land, they could not get along without &s;ome contention; a &s;mart action
<PB N="20" REF="016509_0010_0FAFE8F80647A698">
en&s;ued on the 16th, when the Americans played the ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, and di&s;concerted their enemy. The motion of our enemy gave evidence that it was their intention to get beyond our army, and prevent their retreat from the i&s;land; but the caution and watchfulne&s;s of our Commander in Chief eluded their de&s;ign, by moving towards the north part of the i&s;land, that he might at any time &s;ecure him&s;elf a retreat.</P>
<P>October 15th, General Mercer, with a party, made an excur&s;ion upon Staten-I&s;land, where there was a party of the enemy; but they being apprized of our approach, fled with precipitation; a few were taken, with a number of arms, and &s;ome baggage.</P>
<P>About the &s;ame time was the great movement of the enemy up the we&s;tern found, and their landing in large bodies at Frog Point: This was a movement of Gene|ral Howe's for making a bold pu&s;h, to hem in and at one blow cut off our army. It was the opinion of the intelli|gent, that the &s;ituation of the army of the States was yet too confined, and that it was un&s;afe to continue as they were, or hazard the important cau&s;e, in which, if they &s;hould not &s;ucceed, the army might be lo&s;t, as a retreat would be impracticable. It was therefore con|cluded to counteract the enemy, by a more general movement. It &s;eems our whole force was to be collect|ed to the northward of King&s;bridge, that we might de|feat the enemy in their operations. This movement was calculated to prevent the enemy from ravaging the country, &s;urrounding our army, and to lead them from the cover of their &s;hipping. This de&s;ign was &s;o far ef|fected, that all the road from King&s;bridge to Ea&s;t Che&s;|ter was open to the enemy, even from New-York, ex|cept Fort-Wa&s;hington&punc; a few guards, and a regiment at King&s;bridge, who were ordered, in ca&s;e of di&s;tre&s;s, to retreat to Fort-Wa&s;hington.</P>
<P>While the&s;e things were doing, the enemy were not idle; having collected their forces, they ranged their &s;hips and troops along the &s;hore as far as Ea&s;t-Che&s;ter.</P>
<P>On the 18th day of October they began a heavy can|nonading. Their motions being narrowly watched, an ambu&s;cade was laid for them, which had in a good

mea&s;ure its de&s;ired effect; they were put to &s;light, with con&s;iderable lo&s;s, and &s;ome captivated (36.) On the 23d day there was a warm engagement between a party of our army and the enemy, when they were beaten, and 13 He&s;&s;ians left dead on the field. On the 27th the enemy attacked our lines at Harlem, when they were repul&s;ed three &s;everal times &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, and went off in confu&s;ion, with con&s;iderable lo&s;s: And on the 28th the whole body of the enemy was perceived to be ad|vancing. This gave an alarm to the army of the States, and large advance guards were kept out, towards which the enemy &s;oon appeared advancing in &s;olid columns, and attempted to collect upon every &s;ide. The enemy began their fire, which was very heavy, and was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e|turned with the greate&s;t vigour. Our numbers engag|ed being va&s;tly inferior, they retreated before the ene|my, which gave them an opportunity of advancing near our lines, where, from a neighbouring hill, they play|ed their cannon with amazing fury for a while, then cea&s;ed. Our lo&s;s was not great, nor equal to the dan|ger we &s;eemed to be in, and by the be&s;t accounts not equal to the lo&s;s of the enemy.</P>

<P>October 3^&s;^t, our General perceived the enemy had compleated 4 or 5 batteries upon the neighbouring hills, which overlooked the plains where our army lay, &s;o that it could not be &s;afe keeping that &s;tation; according|ly the army was moved to the hills above the plains.&mdash;The enemy advanced to the plains, and were ri&s;ing the hills, when they were &s;aluted by a number of our can|non, and &s;oon retired.</P>
<P>General Howe here brings to mind the ca&s;e of Ben|hadad, the Syrian, who warred again&s;t I&s;rael with ill &s;ucce&s;s; his mini&s;ters, in a council of war, delivered their advice in the&s;e terms: Their Gods are the Gods of the hills, and therefore they were &s;tronger than we; but let us fight again&s;t them in the plain, and &s;urely we &s;hall be &s;tronger than they.&mdash;He hearkened to their

voice, but how to put it into execution was the que&s;tion; for they being a&s;&s;ailants, the I&s;raelites were ma&s;ters of the ground, and there was no other way of bringing them into the plains, but by beating them from the hills.&mdash;Afterwards they were placed in the plains, and there convinced, by woful experience, that I&s;rael's God was God of the vallies as well as of the hills, Kings xx.</P>
<P>A learned prelate ob&s;erves, that "in the inva&s;ion of a country, the invaded can chu&s;e their ground; and as it is their intere&s;t to avoid coming to a deci&s;ive action, &s;o being amid&s;t their own native &s;tores and provi&s;ions, they have it in their power: On the the contrary, the inva|der mu&s;t attack his foes where he finds them po&s;ted&punc; for by rea&s;on of the &s;cantine&s;s and uncertainty of &s;upplies in an enemy's country, he has not for the mo&s;t part time to draw them, by military &s;tratagems, from their advantages<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bi&s;hop Warburton's Divine Legation.</NOTE>."</P>
<P>From the&s;e ob&s;ervations we may be led to &s;ee that General Wa&s;hington, in his &s;everal movements, di&s;cover|ed the mo&s;t con&s;ummate general&s;hip.</P>
<P>General Howe being hitherto di&s;appointed, turned his attention to Fort Wa&s;hington, and on the 16th day of November attac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ed our lines at Harlem, with a much &s;uperior force to that of the ga<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ri&s;on. Our men fought to their honor, but being overpowered by numbers, they were obliged to retreat to the fort.&mdash;Soon after, they were &s;ummoned to &s;urrender, and finding them&s;elves unable to defend it, they &s;ubmitted, and were made pri&s;oners of war, to the number of about 2000.

He arrived at Quebec May 6, 1776. This army, with a very &s;trong fleet, arrived at Crown-Point about the beginning of July, 1777. Soon after their arrival, parties were &s;ent out to reconnoitre the &s;ituation of our forts and army at Ticonderoga. Our forts there were &s;aid to be in the be&s;t condition; our army con&s;i&s;ted of about 3 or 4000 men, &s;aid to be in high &s;pirits. The Commander in Chief, General St. Clair, gaining intelli|gence of the &s;trength of the enemy, called a council of war, when it was judged that they &s;hould not be able to hold the fort, with the lines; accordingly orders were immediately given <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> its evacuation, and as in|&s;tantly obeyed. Their whole works were abandoned; and mo&s;t of their &s;tores left for the enemy, who &s;oon took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of them, and pur&s;ued the garri&s;on with the greate&s;t vigour and &s;pirit. Our garri&s;on retreat to Fort-Ann, then to Fort-Edward, and from thence to Sa|ratoga and Still water. The tidings of this unexpected retreat of our forces &s;truck every face with palene&s;s, and every heart with trembling. Thou&s;ands of cur&s;es, imprecations and ha&s;ty cen&s;ures, were thrown out again&s;t the officer who commanded in that department. What fearful con&s;equences were meditated? With old Jacob we were ready to &s;ay, the&s;e things are again&s;t us. But alas, how little do we know how &s;hort and con|tracted are our views?

Things viewed in their &s;eparate &s;everal parts, will appear very different than when they are viewed collectively and together.

<P>General Burgoyne, &s;lu&s;hed with a train of &s;ucce&s;&s;es, until he had got as far as Fort Edward, was ready to flatter him&s;elf that all would come in and bow to his &s;tandard. With this view he publi&s;hed his manife&s;to, promi&s;ing royal protection, &amp;c. He had previou&s;ly &s;ent out a party by the way of O&s;wego, to attack Fort Schuy|ler, near the Oneida Lake, and reduce to &s;ubjection the county of Tryon; but here he was &s;adly di&s;appointed. His party was defeated, many killed and made pri&s;oners, in all 300, chiefly Indians, when the brave General Har|kemer lo&s;t his life. This was on Augu&s;t 6. The Briti&s;h General having gained the knowledge of &s;ome &s;tores at Bennington, in the State of Vermont, detached Col.

<P>We left General Howe in the city of Philadelphia, where he peaceably &s;pent the winter, when nothing of any great importance took place, either on one &s;ide or the other. But a mo&s;t important event took place about the beginning of this year, on the 6th of February, when by the indefatigable &s;ervices of the Plenipoten|tiaries of the United States of America, Me&s;&s;ieurs Franklin and Dean, a treaty of alliance and commerce was acceded to by the King of France, and in con&s;e|quence thereof an Amba&s;&s;ador was &s;ent to attend the Congre&s;s of the&s;e United States. Thus we have &s;een
<PB N="31" REF="016509_0015_0FAFE8FF820F2D08">
that God, who&s;e kingdom is over all, and in who&s;e hand are the hearts of the kings of the earth, which he can turn as the rivers of water, hath di&s;po&s;ed one of the mo&s;t powerful monarchs in Europe to own and e&s;pou&s;e the cau&s;e of his injured people in this country. And while we &s;ee the&s;e things actually accompli&s;hed, the king's repre&s;entative at our court, his &s;hips on our coa&s;ts for our defence and protection, I &s;ay, while the&s;e things are to the view of every one indi&s;putable, we have good rea&s;on to hope and expect that other European powers will follow the laudable example, and which to all appearance is at the very door. The conduct of France relative to America is a tremendous blow to Great-Britain, and has brought on &s;uch a contention as will not be ea&s;ily removed. By this means the Briti&s;h monarch may find other &s;ervice for his &s;hips and armies, than to burn, de&s;troy and butcher his unoffending well-wi&s;hers in America. Such I tru&s;t we may be &s;tiled, though we have been inhumanly and &s;avagely treated; yet as we make a profe&s;&s;ion of chri&s;tianity, benevolence mu&s;t mark our character.</P>
<P>The wi&s;e and righteous Governor of the world is cutting out other work for Britain than that &s;he has been employing her&s;elf about the&s;e three years pa&s;t. It has been a matter of &s;peculation with &s;ome, that the Americans &s;hould be fond of forming an alliance with France, on account of her religious &s;entiments, being in general Roman Catholics; and doubtle&s;s every one that is an enemy to this alliance will make this the ground of their objections, even though they were Catholics them&s;elves, or equally &s;uper&s;titious, and not a whit better.</P>
<P>Upon which I would ob&s;erve, that &s;uch an alliance is not unexampled; England has been in alliance with Portugal, the inhabitants of which are almo&s;t if not wholly Roman Catholics; and France with Holland, yet the Hollanders are chiefly Pre&s;byterians. The king of England has been in alliance with the king of Pru&s;&s;ia, where Lutherani&s;m chiefly prevails. And it is not long &s;ince we were threatened with an alliance and a&s;&s;i&s;tance which Great-Britain fought after with Ru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters">
<PB N="32" REF="016509_0016_0FAFE900412559A8">
In that ca&s;e their different &s;entiments in religious mat|ters were no bar in the way. Differences in religion have no operation in the political &s;y&s;tem, and commer|cial intere&s;t of nations and people; but yet advantage may ari&s;e by &s;uch an alliance, in a moral or religious view, though not by de&s;ign and immediately, yet in its operation and influence it may have this happy ef|fect. The Prote&s;tants in France are not an incon&s;ider|able part of the nation, who have always been kept un|der and much out of &s;ight, ever &s;ince the repeal of the edict of Nantz. Now this alliance may have a good ten|dency to cure the nation of their bigotry, root out their &s;anguinary notions, and introduce an univer&s;al toleration. They have already granted a toleration for traders and factors, or any that &s;hall &s;ettle among them from Ame|rica. This beginning may have a happy and glorious end; and if it &s;hould terminate as there is &s;ome ground to hope it may, the now unhappy Prote&s;tants of that country would feel the mo&s;t grateful &s;en&s;e of divine kindne&s;s, and ble&s;s God that &s;uch an alliance had been formed. The&s;e things duly con&s;idered are &s;ufficient to remove tho&s;e difficulties that have perplexed the minds of &s;ome, who may have thought &s;uch a thing unprecedented.&mdash;May it not be con&s;idered as a &s;mile of divine providence, and one of the methods that God is taking for our help and deliverance from pre&s;ent trouble?</P>
<P>Perhaps this may have been one rea&s;on that the Bri|ti&s;h troops evacuated the city of Philadelphia (June 18) that their force might be more united, and that they might be able to &s;ecure New-York, in ca&s;e any attempt &s;hould, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of France, be made again&s;t it. But be that as it may, let the rea&s;ons remain with them&s;elves. It was enough for us to know they had evacuated the city, and that we might prevent as much of their mi&s;chief as po&s;&s;ible, our army were &s;oon in pur|&s;uit of them. They were overtaken at Monmouth, the 28th day of June, 1773, when a very warm engagement en&s;ued&punc; the Briti&s;h forces, after twelve hours exertion, gave way, and left the field, with their dead unburied, to the number of 300, and 1250 wounded. Of the Ame|ricans, 7 officers and 52 rank and file were killed, and
<PB N="33" REF="016509_0016_0FAFE900412559A8">
170 wounded. In the dead of the night with precipi|tation they fled, that they might avoid their pur&s;uers. Their &s;light was not known in our camp until next morning, and the &s;ultrine&s;s of the &s;ea&s;on rendered it impracticable to pur&s;ue them to advantage; nor did they make any delay until they arrived within the li|mits of New-York.</P>
<P>In this in&s;tance, as in many others, we may take no|tice of the manifold goodne&s;s of God, in the protection and &s;ucce&s;s of our troops; and that they are made a terror to their enemy.

<P>I might here take occa&s;ion ju&s;t to mention ano|ther in&s;tance of &s;ucce&s;s, in an action with our enemies upon Rhode-I&s;land, where, in an open field|fight, after &s;ome hours engagement, the enemy were forced to flee, and leave the field to our troops (Augu&s;t 28.) By the be&s;t accounts their numbers were &s;uperior. It is true that this expedition did not &s;ucceed according to the wi&s;hes of every friend to his country, yet it is as true, that our forces behaved with a bravery becoming Americans. The failure of the expedition did not take its ri&s;e from any defect in ge|neral&s;hip, or want of valour in officers or &s;oldiers; but merely from a di&s;appointment of providence. It was well known, previous to the undertaking, that unle&s;s the harbour was blocked up, there would be little or no hope of &s;ucceding, and while that was effected, all hope among our enemies was gone, therefore they burnt and &s;unk their ve&s;&s;els, to the number of nine, which in the whole carried 206 guns, and employed their &s;eamen in a&s;&s;i&s;ting to defend the garri&s;on again&s;t our forces. The French fleet being detained at &s;ea by a violent gale of wind, were &s;ome of them di&s;ina&s;ted, and obliged to repair to Bo&s;ton to refit. This gave an opportunity to the enemy to throw in &s;uccours from New-York, which di&s;appointed, us of obtaining the prize we had in view; not with &s;tanding kind provi|dence &s;o far &s;miled upon our arms as to vanqui&s;h our enemy in the field, and thereby gave a &s;afe retreat off

the i&s;land, with whatever was convenient and nece&s;&s;a|ry to be brought off.</P>
<P>And now &s;hould we not make the P&s;almi&s;t's enquiry, and &s;ay, what &s;hall we render to the Lord for all his be|nefits?</P>
<P>We are brought now to a period, when we have far le&s;s to fear from them then we ever had &s;ince they beg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> ho&s;tilities again&s;t us. Heaven has provided for us <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">werful ally, who&s;e enterprizes in di&s;tant parts mu&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">mmand the attention of Britain, and draw her forces from our &s;hores. This we &s;ee is already the happy effect of our treaty of amity and commerce. But were we alone, we &s;hould have no rea&s;on to fear only from our&s;elves, for would we not be our own de|&s;troyers, it would not be in the power of our enemies to do it. They might di&s;tre&s;s us, but they could not de&s;troy us: They might vex and di&s;trub us, but they could not prevail again&s;t us. If we could &s;upport our virtue, there would be no doubt but we could &s;upport our cau&s;e. If God be on our &s;ide, we need not fear what man can do unto us.</P>
<P>That God has appeared for us, amid&s;t all the correc|tions we have met with, is beyond a doubt; it will not admit of the lea&s;t he&s;itation: That he has cha&s;ti&s;ed us many ways, and by many di&s;appointments, is very ma|nife&s;t; and it is as evident, that he has not for&s;aken us. He has given us many tokens for good. That God has from the beginning been engaged in behalf of the United States, is evident from this one con&s;ideration, namely, his re&s;training our enemies. He &s;uffered them to di&s;tre&s;s us, fir&s;t, when we were mo&s;t unprepared; even then they were put to flight. And all along, from time to time, he has &s;uffered them to proceed in the &s;ame proportion that we have in our preparations and expertne&s;s in war. Had our enemies taken advantage of our weakne&s;s and un&s;kilfulne&s;s, what carnage might they have made? What horror and de&s;olation might they have &s;pread through the land? But as God &s;aith to the raging waves of the &s;ea, &s;o he &s;aith to the fierce and head&s;trong pa&s;&s;ions of men, hitherto &s;hall ye go, and no further. And when we &s;ee &s;uch evi|dent

marks of the divine hand, not only in correction but mercy, can we do le&s;s than recount his works, and make the mo&s;t grateful returns for his favour? And when we &s;ing his prai&s;es, let us be careful we never for|get his works. With the P&s;almi&s;t we &s;hould &s;ay, not unto us, O Lord, not unto us, but to thy name be all the glory. We have de&s;erved nothing but correction, yea, nothing &s;hort of being cut off, and deprived of all our privileges. It is not for our &s;akes, but for his great name &s;ake, that we are yet a people &s;aved of the Lord, who is the &s;hield of our help, and the &s;word of our ex|cellency. Ble&s;&s;ed be the Lord.</P>
<P>While we acknowledge the kindne&s;s and care of God, the all wi&s;e governor of the world, towards his church and people, may we fear to offend him&mdash;Let us not abu&s;e his patience and goodne&s;s, by turning his grace into wantonne&s;s, and the indulgence of tho&s;e &s;ins that incur his anger and wrath.&mdash;Let us guard again&s;t a &s;elfi&s;h, covetous and oppre&s;&s;ive temper, with every abomina|tion, that through the depravity of nature we are prompted to; for if our ways plea&s;e God, then he will a&s;&s;uredly make our enemies at peace with us.</P>
<P>Finally, has God, in his good providence, hitherto led and pre&s;erved the feeble tribes of his people? have they not the greate&s;t rea&s;on, the highe&s;t encourage|ment to tru&s;t in him, who hath &s;tiled him&s;elf the God of the armies of I&s;rael? He who hath done &s;o much for this people, and in &s;o many in&s;tances &s;o manife&s;tly ap|peared for their help and deliverance, will accompli&s;h his own work in their &s;alvation, if they, by their &s;tupi|dity and folly, do not provoke him to change the con|duct of his providences. May his unerring wi&s;dom guide us&mdash;his all powerful arm protect us&mdash;his grace and goodne&s;s ever accompany us, that we may be kept through faith to &s;alvation. Amen.</P>
