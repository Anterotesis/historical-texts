<HEAD>LETTER I.</HEAD>
<P>I AGAIN take up the pen to write to you at the Chateau of Mon&s;. du F&mdash;, from which place I la&s;t year &s;ent you the hi&s;tory of his mis|fortunes; tho&s;e misfortunes which have led me to love, as well as admire, the revolution. For you know we are &s;o framed that, while we contemplate the deliverance of millions with a &s;ublime emotion of wonder and exultation, the tears of tenderne&s;s, the throbbings of &s;ympathy, are re&s;erved for the moment when we &s;elect one happy family from the great national groupe, and when, amid&s;t the loud acclamations of an

innumerable multitude, we can di&s;tingui&s;h the &s;oothing &s;ounds of dome&s;tic felicity. I have be|held with awful a&s;toni&s;hment the &s;un of liberty &s;preading its broad blaze over the French hem|i&s;phere; but I have traced with inexpre&s;&s;ible de|light that benignant beam which has cha&s;ed ev|ery cloud of calamity from the dwelling of Mon&s;. du F&mdash;.</P>
<P>It &s;eems the recompen&s;e of my French patri|oti&s;m that I have on &s;everal occa&s;ions had the good fortune to witne&s;s tho&s;e &s;cenes of general felicity, in which it requires but common &s;en&s;i|bility to partake. I went to Rouen the very day before the King accepted the con&s;titution. When the courier arrived with this intelligence, the cannons were immediately fired, the bells of all the churches rung, and the people di&s;played their joy by crowding the &s;treets with bon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ires, at the di&s;tance of every eight or ten yards. I ob|&s;erved &s;ome of the people, who were too poor to contribute a portion of wood, bring for their offering, a part of an old bed&s;tead, a leg of a broken chair, &amp;c. to feed the flame.</P>
<P>Strangers &s;topped, and congratulated one an|other in the &s;treets, which re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ounded with cries of exultation, among which the &s;ounds of<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Long live the King of the French.</HI></NOTE> "Vive le Roi des Fran&amp;c;cedil;ois," were almo&s;t lo&s;t

<P>In the afternoon Te Deum was &s;ung in the cathedral. The eight hundred electors of the department, who were at that time a&s;&s;embled at Rouen, walked in proce&s;&s;ion, attended by all the officers of the admini&s;tration, and &s;everal battal|ions of the national guard. An immen&s;e multi|tude filled every part of the cathedral; the &s;ounds of the organ and the drums, the voices of the choir, and the acclamations of the people, were mingled together, and rolled through the long ai&s;ies of the building. It was impo&s;&s;ible to witne&s;s this religious &s;olemnity, and reflect on the greatne&s;s of the occa&s;ion which had called &s;o immen&s;e a multitude together, that of having completed the glorious work of a free govern|ment, without catching the enthu&s;ia&s;m which beat high in every bo&s;om.</P>
<P>Indeed living in France at pre&s;ent, appears to me &s;omewhat like living in a region of romance. Events the mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hing and marvellous are here the occurrences of the day, and every new&s;|paper is filled with articles of intelligence that will form a new era in the hi&s;tory of mankind.

The &s;entiments of the people al&s;o are elevated far above the pitch of common life. All the motives which mo&s;t powerfully &s;timulate the mind in its ordinary &s;tate, &s;eem repre&s;&s;ed in con|&s;ideration of the public good, and every &s;elfi&s;h intere&s;t is &s;acrificed with fond alacrity at the altar of the country. For my part, while I con|template the&s;e things, I &s;ometimes think that the age of chivalry, in&s;tead of being pa&s;t for ever, is ju&s;t returned; not indeed in its erroneous notions of loyalty, honour, and gallantry, which are as lit|tle<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>The order of the day.</HI></NOTE> "<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> l'ordre du jour," as its dwarfs, giants, and impri&s;oned dam&s;els; but in its noble con|tempt of &s;ordid cares, its &s;pirit of un&s;ullied gen|ero&s;ity, and its heroic zeal for the happine&s;s of others.</P>
<P>The completion of the new government has been celebrated by general demon&s;trations of joy throughout the whole kingdom; and thus be|gins, under the au&s;pices of liberty, the con&s;titu|tional reign of Lewis the Sixteenth.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid that the Abb&eacute; Maury, who left France as &s;oon as the con&s;titution was accepted, is going to Rome, and that the pope intends to give him a cardinal's hat, in recompen&s;e for the ob&s;tinate battle he has &s;o long fought again&s;t rea|&s;on and philo&s;ophy. The patriots declare that

<P>WE left our friends in Normandy a fort|night ago, and have pitched our tent at Orleans. Our journey furni&s;hed many agreeable &s;ubjects of reflection to my mind, which you well know has &s;trongly caught the contagion of French patrioti&s;m.</P>
<P>On the windows of every inn at which we &s;topped, we &s;aw the little lamps &s;till fixed, which had been lighted at the f&egrave;tes given in every town upon the completion of the con&s;titution. In all the villages through which we pa&s;&s;ed, I read, in&s;cribed in great characters,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Liberty or dea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">..</HI></NOTE> "La libert&eacute;, ou la mort." In &s;everal places I heard that the workmen had contributed &s;o many days labour towards the expen&s;e of &s;ending men to the frontiers. In &s;hort, wherever we journey|ed, liberty &s;eemed to have run like electric fire along the country, and pervaded every object in its pa&s;&s;age. Do you think all the Au&s;trians of

the earth will &s;ubdue this people? Oh no: nothing is more true than, that a people are free whenever with one unanimous &s;ublime &s;enti|ment they determine to be &s;o. By the way, I have heard Homer laughed at by &s;ome crit|ics, for making an army of thirty thou&s;and men repeat at the &s;ame time the &s;ame &s;entiment; yet &s;omething of this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ort actually happened at the taking of the Ba&s;tile.

<P>When we drew near O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">leans, we &s;aw the country, as far as the eye could reach, covered with grapes, and men, women, and children, employed in gathering the vintage. This &s;cene gave me a new image of plenty, a new a&s;pect of the riches of nature, which it was impo&s;&s;ible to contemplate without the mo&s;t plea&s;ing emotion. But a de&s;cription of the vintage will perhaps read better in ver&s;e, than pro&s;e: and I &s;hall therefore &s;end you a copy of a rhyming letter which I have written to my friend Dr. Moore on this &s;ubject.

<P>ORLEANS is a very ancient town, built, or rather rebuilt, by the Emperor Aurelian,

upon the ruins of another town, called Genabi|am. It takes its pre&s;ent name of Orleans, or the golden city, from the Emperor Aurelian. This town is large and hand&s;ome.

Here is a noble cathedral of exqui&s;ite workman&s;hip, and of which the fir&s;t &s;tone was laid by Henry the Fourth; a circum&s;tance which makes me contemplate the building with addi|tional plea&s;ure.

The bi&s;hop of Orl&eacute;ans, who is de&s;cended from the ancient nobility of France, has di&s;tin|gui&s;hed him&s;elf by his patrioti&s;m; but there are at Orleans a hundred and fifty chanoines, who are far from being patriots. The&s;e chanoines enjoyed each two or three thou&s;and livres a year for chanting Latin hymns in the cathedral.

The&s;e hundred and fifty chanoines had certainly a hundred and fifty cooks, and the&s;e cooks probably have families. The chanoines and the cooks have both lo&s;t their places, and con&s;equently they and their families are ari&s;tocrates.</P>

I own tho&s;e frightful re&s;ervoirs &s;truck my imag|ination as if &s;tained with the blood of Africans.</P>
<P>The long train of calamities which are the portion of that unhappy race, crowded in &s;ad &s;ucce&s;&s;ion upon my mind, and I ob&s;erved, with a degree of horror which I could not repre&s;s, the proce&s;s of a luxury obtained for the inhabitants of one part of the globe, by the wrongs, the ag|onies, the de&s;pair of the inhabitants of another part.&mdash;Alas! why is there &s;o much more mi&s;ery in this world than benevolence can cure? Why, in the public di&s;cu&s;&s;ions in France and in Eng|land, on the Slave Trade, are the po&s;&s;ibilities of gain and lo&s;s calculated with &s;uch nice preci|&s;ion? Why are crimes and inju&s;tice, de&s;olation and death, treated in a &s;tyle &s;o very mercantile that humanity li&s;tens in de&s;pair to their deliber|ations?</P>
<P>From thence we went to &s;ee a very con&s;ider|able manufactory for &s;pinning cotton, which has
<PB N="24" REF="025039_0026_0FCDAB2A63373688">
been e&s;tabli&s;hed here by an Engli&s;h gentleman, to whom we are obliged for that cordial ho&s;pital|ity, which is the ancient and honourable character|i&s;tic of our country, and which is &s;o peculiarly grateful to the heart when received in a land of &s;trangers.</P>
<P>This manufacture, while it di&s;plays the won|derful power of mechani&s;m, gives occa&s;ion al&s;o to the exerci&s;e of humanity, by employing not only a great number of men, but fourteen hundred women and children.</P>
<P>The gentleman to whom the manufacture belongs, related to me the following circum|&s;tance:&mdash;He happened to be in the National A&s;&s;embly at Ver&s;ailles, when the king declared that he would give orders for di&s;banding the army which &s;urrounded Paris, and would him|&s;elf come to the Mai&s;on de Ville, in compliance with the wi&s;hes of his people. Mr. F&mdash;, after taking a copy of the king's harangue with his pencil, immediately mounted his hor&s;e, and galloped to Paris, in order to carry this intelli|gence. At the Pont Neuf he was &s;topped, the bridle of his hor&s;e &s;eized, and the people wanted to take him to la Mai&s;on de Ville. He told them that he was an Engli&s;hman, the friend of liberty, and had galloped all the way from Ver|&s;ailles, in order to bring them good news.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="025039_0027_0FCDAB2E93522AC0">
The people conducted him to the Palais Royal, and there he di&s;mounted. A table was placed in the court of the Palais Royal, upon which he &s;tood, and read over and over again the king's harrangue. After having remained there a con&s;iderable time, he went into a coffee-hou&s;e of the Palais Royal to refre&s;h him&s;elf, and then enquired for his hor&s;e. The hor&s;e was not to be found. Mr. F&mdash;left a note at the coffee-hou&s;e, intreating that the per&s;on who had taken care of the Engli&s;hman's hor&s;e, while he was reading the king's &s;peech, in the Palais Royal, would deliver him to the ma&s;ter of the coffee-hou&s;e.</P>
<P>A few days after, an an&s;wer was &s;ent to Mr. F&mdash;, informing him, that the Engli&s;h hor&s;e had gone back to Ver&s;ailles, in order to conduct the king to Paris; and was again gone to the country upon bu&s;ine&s;s of importance to the nation, but that whenever he returned he &s;hould be &s;ent to his ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>The hor&s;e accordingly arrived, but not with|out having &s;uffered a little for his &s;ervices to the &s;tate; and, though he was ever after particularly cheri&s;hed by Mr. F&mdash;, he died in the &s;econd year of French liberty; and I have &s;ome thoughts of writing his epitaph.</P>

and con&s;ternation of the French court, when the intelligence that the Ba&s;tille was taken reached Ver&s;ailles.

<P>I lately heard an account of a conver&s;ation which pa&s;&s;ed at Ver&s;ailles, on the morning of the 14th of July, 1789, and which proves how little the court were prepared for the memorable event of that immortal day.</P>

<P>Every year on the eighth of May, the day on which Jeanne d'Arc cha&s;ed the Engli&s;h, and rai&s;ed the &s;iege of Orl&eacute;ans, there is a &s;olemn proce&s;&s;ion in this town, in commemoration of that event.

Prayers of thank&s;giving for the deliverance of the town are &s;aid at the cathedral, after which a &s;ermon is preached, wherein the magnanimous virtues of Jeanne d'Arc are celebrated; and, by way of giving re|lief to the picture, the preacher never <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ails to paint in the darke&s;t colours the crimes of the Engli&s;h, and their dete&s;table cruelty towards this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">eroi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e, to whom, as Mr. Hum<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> the hi&s;to|rian ju&s;tly remarks, the more generous &s;uper|&s;tition

When the guilt of our nation has been made &s;ufficiently manife&s;t, the &s;ermon concludes, a hymn is &s;ung, and the day ends with a public entertainment.

You can, in &s;hort, perceive that &s;he has been the companion of a great man. I heard lately an incident charac|teri&s;tic enough of Rou&s;&s;eau. At a friend's hou&s;e, at dinner, he prai&s;ed the wine: his friend &s;ent him fifty bottles. Rou&s;&s;eau felt him&s;elf offended; but as the pre&s;ent was offered by an old friend, he determined to accept ten bottles, and returned forty. A &s;hort time after he in|vited his friend and his family to &s;upper. When they arrived they found Rou&s;&s;eau very bu&s;y turning the &s;pit. "How extraordinary is it," exclaimed his friend, "to &s;ee the fir&s;t genius of Europe employed in turning a &s;pit!" "Why," an&s;wered Rou&s;&s;eau, with great &s;im|plicity
<PB N="32" REF="025039_0034_0FCDAB3F566BA790">
and &s;ang-froid, "if I were not to turn the &s;pit, you would certainly lo&s;e your &s;upper: my wife is gone to buy a &s;allad, and the &s;pit mu&s;t be turned." At &s;upper Rou&s;&s;eau produced, for the fir&s;t time, the wine which his friend had &s;ent him: but no &s;ooner had he ta&s;ted it, than he &s;uddenly put the gla&s;s from his lips, exclaiming with the mo&s;t violent emotion, that it was not the &s;ame wine he had drank at his friend's hou&s;e who he perceived had a de&s;ign to poi&s;on him. In vain his friend prote&s;ted his innocence: Rou&s;&s;eau's imagination, once po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by this idea,
<Q>&mdash;<HI>di&s;placed the mirth; broke the good Meeting with mo&s;t admir'd di&s;order.</HI>
<BIBL><HI>SHAKSPEARE.</HI></BIBL></Q>
His friend was immediately obliged to retire, and they never met again.</P>
<P>You, who are an admirer of Rou&s;&s;eau, will be plea&s;ed to hear of a tribute of enthu&s;ia&s;m paid to his memory lately by two of our countrymen. The&s;e young Engli&s;hmen went to vi&s;it the tomb of this lover of nature, which is placed in a beautiful little i&s;land on the e&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">te of Mon&s;. Girardin. Not long before their arrival, &s;ome profane mortal had dared to in&s;ult the &s;acred a&s;hes of Jean Jaques: and Mon&s;. Girardin, filled with indignation at this atrocious conduct, had
<PB N="33" REF="025039_0035_0FCDAB41EF9D9340">
given orders, that no per&s;on, without a particu|lar admi&s;&s;ion from him&s;elf, &s;hould henceforth be permitted to vi&s;it the i&s;land. In vain our young Engli&s;hmen made prote&s;tations of their profound veneration for Rou&s;&s;eau; in vain they implored Mon&s;ieur Girardin's boatman to conduct them acro&s;s the &s;tream. The boatman, &s;urly as Charon him&s;elf, adhered inflexibly to the orders of his ma&s;ter. The young Engli&s;hmen, finding him inexorable, threw off their clothes, jumped into the &s;tream, and &s;wam to the i&s;land.&mdash;The gentleman who related to me this circum&s;tance, told me, that he and a friend had vi&s;ited together this i&s;land, and, kneeling at the tomb of Rou&s;|&s;eau, had burnt a book, publi&s;hed a &s;hort time after his death by Diderot, in which he had treat|ed the memory of Rou&s;&s;eau with the mo&s;t cruel indignity: and this he had done from a very unworthy motive. He had heard that the Con|fe&s;&s;ions of Rou&s;&s;eau were going to be publi&s;hed; and concluding that he &s;hould be ill treated in tho&s;e Confe&s;&s;ions, on account of his quarrel with Rou&s;&s;eau, he determined to be beforehand in abu&s;e. But when the Confe&s;&s;ions were publi&s;hed, it was found that the feeling heart of Jean Jaques could not detach it&s;elf from his former friend, who had always continued to po&s;&s;e&s;s a place in his affections.&mdash;Mon&s;. Girar|din
<PB N="34" REF="025039_0036_0FCDAB42E9129E30">
was ab&s;ent from home, when the &s;acrifice of Diderot's book was offered at Rou&s;&s;eau's tomb. When he returned, his boatman told him, that during his ab&s;ence two gentlemen had performed &s;ome witchcraft or other at the tomb; that he had ob&s;erved them at a little di&s;tance; that they had &s;truck a &s;tone, brought out a flame, and kept it burning an extraordinary length of time. Mon&s;. Girardin enquired into the meaning of the&s;e my&s;terious rites, and received an account of the &s;acrifice.</P>
<P>The celebrated opera-dancer, Mademoi&s;elle Theodore, who&s;e talents I am told are not con|fined to &s;uperior excellence in dancing, had an enthu&s;ia&s;tic admiration of Rou&s;&s;eau. She al|ways carried a volume of his works in her pocket to the rehear&s;als at the opera, and u&s;ed to read in the pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;es of the dance. One day having heard that Rou&s;&s;eau was in want of a cook, &s;he dre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf in a coar&s;e &s;tuff gown, a coloured apron, and a cloth cap, and went in this di&s;gui&s;e to offer him her &s;ervices.</P>
<P>After Rou&s;&s;eau's death, Mademoi&s;elle Theo|dore made a pilgrimage to his grave; and there, in the true &s;pirit of enthu&s;ia&s;tic homage, cutting off one of the long tre&s;&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s of her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ine hair, &s;he hung it as an offering upon his tomb.</P>

<P>A number of poor people in Orl&eacute;ans gain their livelihood by conveying goods in little carts from the quay to the hou&s;es of the mer|chants.

<P>I HAVE been to vi&s;it a chateau about a league from Orl&eacute;ans; part of which was built by the celebrated Lord Bolingbroke, and in which he pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome years of his exile, with his wife, the niece of Madame de Maintenon. Before the windows of the chateau ri&s;es a beau|tiful &s;mall river, called le Loiret, which, after a winding cour&s;e of three leagues, through a charm|ing country, falls into the Loire. The grounds of this chateau are in &s;ome parts formed into long alleys, &s;haded by venerable trees, in others &s;pread into lawns, through which the clear Loi|ret pur&s;ues its way. Lord Bolingbroke proba|bly found this retirement well adapted for philo|&s;ophical contemplation, and bad there &s;ufficient lei&s;ure to
<Q><L><HI>Expatiate free on all this &s;cene of man,</HI></L>
<L><HI>A mighty maze, but not without a plan.</HI></L></Q>
In this retreat he wrote the Patriot King. A company of French and Engli&s;h were dining with Lord Bolingbroke at this place, when the news arrived of the death of the Duke of Marl|borough, his ancient enemy. Some of the com|pany had &s;ervility enough to attempt paying their court to Lord Bolingbroke, by mentioning &s;ome
<PB N="41" REF="025039_0043_0FCDAB54091EA3F8">
circum&s;tances to the di&s;advantage of the Duke of Marlborough. At length a Frenchman, who was pre&s;ent, a&s;ked Lord Bolingbroke his opinion of him. "Sir," &s;aid he, "Marlborough was &s;o great a man that I have forgot all his faults."&mdash;The Loiret de&s;erves to be con&s;idered as a &s;ort of cla&s;&s;ical river: for, if a famous Engli&s;h philo&s;|opher had his dwelling at its &s;ource, a far more amiable French philo&s;opher lived &s;ome time at the mouth of this little &s;tream: a philo&s;opher, of whom not only his own country, but human nature may be proud; and who&s;e writings tend to awaken the pure&s;t affections, the mo&s;t &s;ooth|ing emotions, of the human heart. This writer was Fenelon, the mild, the per&s;ua&s;ive preacher of virtue. I have read Gre&s;&s;et's charming poem of Ver-Vert, with particular plea&s;ure, on the banks of that river, which his hero in evil hour failed down; when the nuns of Nantes, hearing of his renown, write

<P>WHEN a French girl is intended for the wife of a merchant, &s;he is carefully in&s;tructed in the arithmetic, after &s;he leaves the convent, where &s;he is u&s;ually taught little more than to count her beads. After &s;he is married &s;he acts as her hu&s;band's fir&s;t clerk, and pa&s;&s;es the whole day in his counting-hou&s;e. Some advantages ari&s;e from this practice; &s;ince a

Whereas, the wife of an Engli&s;h merchant, &s;ometimes from being entirely ignorant of his real &s;ituation, indulges her&s;elf in a mode of liv|ing which ha&s;tens on his ruin, and receives like a thunder-&s;troke the intelligence that her riches were a dream, and that her hu&s;band is a bankrupt.</P>
<P>I am told that commerce was never &s;o flour|i&s;hing in France as it has been for a year pa&s;t, not only in the capital, but throughout the whole kingdom. The advantages which &s;ome have been enabled to gain from the paper money has led them to extraordinary enterpri&s;e, and the lo&s;s which others have &s;u&s;tained has produced extraordinary indu&s;try and activity. Commerce has benefited in both ca&s;es. If the gold of France has vani&s;hed with the noble&s;&s;e, it is not of gold only that that cla&s;s of per&s;ons have di&s;bur|thened their country. They have al&s;o carried away with them that immen&s;e load of prejudices which has &s;o long oppre&s;&s;ed this nation, and which, by connecting degradation and contempt with commerce, deprived the country of the be&s;t u&s;e and improvement of its riches. If the French money has "made unto it&s;elf wings and

Paper money, when the cri&s;is of the revolution is pa&s;t, will, by a proce&s;s only known to free &s;tates, be transformed into pure gold.</P>
<P>I have been at la Mai&s;on de Ville, in which hou&s;e died Francis the Second, the hu&s;band of Mary Queen of Scots. He came to Orl&eacute;ans with Mary, to meet the States General; was &s;uddenly taken ill while he was at ma&s;s, and died immediately.</P>
<P>The name of Mary Stuart is placed in the li&s;t of French female poets. Unfortunate Mary! When &s;he wrote her poetic farewell to this country,

&s;he &s;eems to have felt a &s;ad pre&s;age of her future calamities; tho&s;e calamities which make me forget every weakne&s;s of Mary, and every great quality of Elizabeth; qualities over which the fate of Mary has &s;urely ca&s;t an everla&s;ting &s;hade.</P>

The countenance is uncommonly beautiful. It &s;eems that nature, while &s;he be&s;towed on the Maid of Orl&eacute;ans the heroic qualities of the other &s;ex, did not deny her the &s;oft attractions of her own.</P>
<P>There is al&s;o at the Mai&s;on de Ville the pic|ture of Doctor Petit, who is a native of this place, and has acquired a very high reputation, and an ample fortune as a Phy&s;ician at Paris. He has lately built a hand&s;ome hou&s;e at Orl&eacute;ans, for the purpo&s;e of furni&s;hing advice and medi|cines gratis to the poor; and, with additional benevolence, to defend their little property from inju&s;tice, he has appointed lawyers who have a &s;alary allowed them for pleading the cau&s;e of the indigent.</P>
<P>This public benefactor to his native city is the &s;on of a taylor; and, in order to &s;hew that he was &s;uperior to the prejudices which &s;o long en&s;laved his country, he appointed the olde&s;t taylor at Orl&eacute;ans in indigent circum&s;tances to take care of this new in&s;titution.</P>

<P>THERE is an univer&s;ity at Orl&eacute;ans, found|ed by Philippe le Bel, in 1312. If one can forgive a tyrant who pur&s;ued his own ag|grandizement, &s;ometimes by the mo&s;t perfidious policy, &s;ometimes by the mo&s;t cruel oppre&s;&s;ions, and who fir&s;t changed offences again&s;t the king, which until his reign were only con&s;idered as crimes of felony, into crimes of high trea&s;on, it mu&s;t be in con&s;ideration of his having, in that barbarous age, done &s;omething for the cau&s;e of literature. In this in&s;tance it appears that he did not rea&s;on with his u&s;ual &s;ubtilty; &s;ince the
<PB N="47" REF="025039_0049_0FCDAB63C62FF818">
progre&s;s of literature is very unfavourable to the intere&s;ts of tyranny. What example &s;o mem|orable, and &s;o recent, of this truth, as the event of the French revolution? That glorious event which will probably in its con&s;equences change the face of this earth, and will be marked in the page of hi&s;tory as that luminous point of human annals, from which a better order of things is &s;een to ari&s;e: and this event has &s;urely been the work of literature, of philo&s;ophy, of the enlarg|ing views of mankind. Liberty &s;prings as nat|urally from knowledge, as light from the &s;un; and the liberty which the French have acquired, and are determined to maintain, appears to be the deliberate, the noble, the augu&s;t choice of rea&s;on. It has no re&s;emblance to tho&s;e fiery meteors which &s;ometimes throw a tran&s;itory fla&s;h acro&s;s that darknn&s;s which they have not &s;ufficient power to di&s;pel: it is the &s;ublime effect of truth vi&s;iting the land, like the day-&s;pring from on high, and, with a &s;imiliar kind of influ|ence over the moral world, warming the heart, in proportion as it enlightens the under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>The French, in forming their new con&s;titu|tion, have made an experiment in politics, and why &s;hould they be cen&s;ured for &s;o doing? While philo&s;ophy teaches the general utility of experimental &s;cience, who will be bold enough
<PB N="48" REF="025039_0050_0FCDAB65A6BEAF98">
to a&s;&s;ert, that the &s;cience of government alone has attained perfection, and is incapable of im|provement? Who will &s;ay to the human under|&s;tanding, on this one point only, thus far &s;halt thou go, and no farther? If the progre&s;&s;ion of rea&s;on in the art of government is forbidden, how mi&s;erable are the pro&s;pects of the human race! for &s;mall indeed is the portion of political happine&s;s hitherto obtained by mankind.</P>
<P>But why do I attempt to ju&s;tify the conduct of the French, when you know we have all heard that they have been guilty of the mo&s;t fatal errors? They have &s;hewn &s;ome di&s;po&s;ition to reform the papal hierarchy, and to &s;eparate the artificial &s;plendour of church e&s;tabli&s;hments from the pure beams of that light which cometh from above. They have invaded the grand monu|ments of the dead, and thrown open the melan|choly tomos of the living. They have led beauty from the &s;olitary cell, where its charms might have bloomed in &s;ecurity, and have expo|&s;ed tho&s;e dangerous attractions to the love and admiration of &s;ociety. They have drawn forth coins and medals, paintings and &s;tatues, from tho&s;e venerable repo&s;itories where they had long lain buried with their pa&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors. Their &s;acrilegious hands have di&s;turbed the learned du&s;t of libraries &s;tored with theological

<P>There are coffee-hou&s;es on the Boulevards, where the people, while they drink their wine, lemonde, or orgeat, are entertained with a play gratis.

<P>Not that the &s;ame gallantry, the &s;ame con|&s;tant attention to women now prevails which exi&s;ted before the revolution.&mdash;Like Moliere's Doctor, "on a chang&eacute; tout cela."

<P>I WENT on Chri&s;tmas day to hear high ma&s;s at the magnificent church of Notre Dame, where the colours are now di&s;played which u&s;ed to float on the towers of the Ba&s;tille, before that gloomy fortre&s;s was taken.</P>
<P>Ma&s;s was performed by the archbi&s;hop of Paris, with great &s;olemnity and devotion. Some parts of the mu&s;ic were fine, and I felt my mind rai&s;ed and affected by it.</P>
<P>I often recollected, in the cour&s;e of the day, with a tender and melancholy emotion, my di&s;|tance from England, where that day is pa&s;&s;ed in a manner far more intere&s;ting than in France. With us, you know, it is &s;pent in the bo&s;om of your family, or con&s;ecrated to the friends and connections you love mo&s;t, while formal vi&s;itors are excluded. This is not the ca&s;e in France<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">: the theatres are crowded with company, and the day pa&s;&s;es in the u&s;ual amu&s;ements.</P>
<P>The la&s;t evening of the old year we went, about eight o'clock, to the Palais Royal, where
<PB N="64" REF="025039_0066_0FCDAB8F492EB928">
the walks were filled with people, and mo&s;t of the &s;hops illuminated, particularly the confec|tioners, which in every part of Paris are &s;plen|didly lighted up on this evening, and make a more agreeable appearance than our pa&s;try-cooks &s;hops on Twelfth-night in London; where the &s;ight of &s;o much plum-cake as is then di&s;played becomes rather oppre&s;&s;ive after ten years of age. The confectioners &s;hops here are filled with ornamented gla&s;s boxes for &s;weet|meats, and a variety of pretty trinkets, which people buy, and pre&s;ent to their friends at this &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>A gentleman who called here this morning, told me an anecdote, which I &s;hall relate to you.&mdash;A friend of his, formerly one of the garde du corps, and who very narrowly e&s;caped from the fury of the people on the 6th of October, 1789, came a few days ago to Paris, and im|mediately &s;ent for a hair-dre&s;&s;er. The officer, while he was dre&s;&s;ing, told the man, that he thought he remembered his face. "Yes, &s;ir, &s;aid the hair-dre&s;&s;er; "and I recollect you per|fectly&mdash;you were in the garde du corps; I &s;aw you on the &s;ixth of October."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Faith, I e&s;caped very narrowly; I was very near being hanged.&mdash;Yes, indeed, &s;ir, and I held the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ord.</HI></NOTE> "Ma <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">oi," &s;aid the officer, "j'ai &eacute;chapp&eacute; bel; j'&eacute;tais b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">en pr&egrave;s

<P>I ob&s;erve with plea&s;ure a proof which the Pari&s;ians give of that general veneration for genius, which prevails in this city, by calling &s;everal of the &s;treets of Paris after the names of celebrated men. Here is the quay of Voltaire, the &s;treet of Jean Jaques Rou&s;&s;eau, the &s;treet of Mirabeau, and, &s;ince the death of the Abbe Cerutti, a man of letters, and a patriot, the peo|ple have made the ci-devant &s;treet of Artois drop its ari&s;tocratical preten&s;ions, and a&s;&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">me the name of Cerutti.</P>
<P>Why is no &s;treet, or &s;quare, in London na|med after Pope, Milton, or, to ri&s;e to the highe&s;t climax of human genius, after Shak&s;peare? We &s;eem to have a &s;trange dread to England of indulging any kind of enthu&s;ia&s;m, however laud|able. We are very apt to wrap up our feelings in the unrelenting &s;everity of wi&s;dom on occa|&s;ions when it would be far more amiable to give way to the impul&s;e of the heart. You will &s;ee Frenchmen ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ed in tears at a tragedy. An Engli&s;hman has quite as much &s;en&s;ibility to a generous or tender &s;entiment; but he thinks it would be unmanly to weep; and, though perhaps half choaked with emotion, he &s;corns

to be overcome, contrives to gain the victory over his feelings, and throws into his counte|nance as much apathy as he can well wi&s;h.</P>
<P>We have al&s;o &s;uch a profound dread of ridicule in England; we are &s;o afraid of one another, that, in&s;tead of going into company with the hope of plea&s;ing, we only entertain the humble de&s;ire of e&s;caping cen&s;ure. A French &s;ociety, with a happy mixture of enthu&s;ia&s;m and noncha|lance, ventures on a thou&s;and traits of &s;enti|ment, and &s;prightly &s;allies, which make the hours pa&s;s away agreeably; but which an Engli&s;h company would not hazard for the world; but

And yet I can find no other rea&s;on for the Eng|li&s;h going into company with their minds in complete armour, and their under&s;tanding always in a po&s;ture of defence, except, that an Engli&s;hman cannot bear to be laughed at, and that a Frenchman can; for I do not believe there is more good nature in France than in England.

<P>THERE were &s;ome commotions lately at Paris, on account of an attempt to mo|nopolize &s;ugar, which was already &s;old at an enormous price, and which the poor of Paris, who live as much upon coffee as the poor of London do upon tea, con&s;idered as one of the nece&s;&s;aries of life. For three nights the guards were trebled, and the town was lighted up for greater &s;ecurity. In a few days the commotion was entirely appea&s;ed, which I own had never given me the &s;malle&s;t alarm; for I always con&s;ider my&s;elf in per|fect &s;afety at Paris under the protection of the national guard, which the Pari&s;ians call, with truth, la <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">auve-garde de la ville. The national guards are &s;o much re&s;pected by the people, that they find it ea&s;y to enforce obedi|ence, and they generally make the wi&s;e&s;t and mo&s;t temperate u&s;e of their power.</P>
<P>I have been &s;everal times at the National A&s;|&s;embly. The debates in this &s;econd legi&s;lature are le&s;s intere&s;ting than tho&s;e of the Con&s;tituent

And one may apply to the genius of this a&s;&s;em|bly what I lately read in a little collection of French letters, where the writer, &s;peaking of the talents for poetry which prevail &s;o general|ly in the &s;outhern provinces of France, the country of the Troubadours, &s;ays, "Nobody has immen&s;e riches of genius in this country; but ea&s;y, even affluent fortunes are very com|mon; and the &s;um of poetical wealth is upon the whole far more con&s;iderable than if a great deal were accumulated upon one head."</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XVI.</HEAD>
<P>I HAVE been at the Jacobins, that &s;ociety which has acted a part &s;o di&s;tingui&s;hed in the French revolution, and in which every political que&s;tion of importance is debated before it is brought forward in the National A&s;&s;embly. The Jacobins have too much influence in the new &s;y&s;tem of French politics not to have many enemies. By tho&s;e per&s;ons every crime, every enormity is attributed to this &s;ociety; which, it is a&s;&s;erted, has not only the fate of France, but the fate of Europe in its hands. If the Emperor of Germany is ho&s;tile to the French nation, it is the fault of the Jacobins. Leopold felt the mo&s;t
<PB N="72" REF="025039_0074_0FCDAC330E945490">
tender and paternal intere&s;t in the pro&s;perity of the new con&s;titution; but he was forced to make a declaration of war again&s;t that formidable, that atrocious &s;ect. To the Jacobins is owing every outrage committed by popular fury, and every trea&s;onable de&s;ign conceived by the ari&s;|tocratic factions. The Jacobins are the con|trivers of all di&s;order, the levellers of all di&s;tinc|tions, and the enemies of all &s;ubordination. It is their intention to overturn the pre&s;ent &s;y&s;tem of government, and divide the French empire into eighty-three republics, governed by Jaco|bins.</P>
<P>Such is the cry, not merely of tho&s;e who have the courage to profe&s;s them&s;elves of the arti&s;toc|ratic party, but al&s;o of tho&s;e, who, however they may regret the &s;ubver&s;ion of the old gov|ernment, have &s;agacity enough to perceive that, like the age of chivalry, it is pa&s;t for ever, and therefore prudently determine to attempt its re&s;|toration no more. The ancient &s;y&s;tem of abu|&s;es they find mu&s;t be renounced, and therefore they limit their ambition to the conver&s;ation of as many errors, as many prejudices as po&s;&s;ible. The&s;e per&s;ons talk to you of their profound re&s;pect for the new con&s;titution, which they ac|cu&s;e the Jacobins of wi&s;hing to &s;ubvert. I believe, indeed, that if there are &s;ome points of
<PB N="73" REF="025039_0075_0FCDAC34A97D42F8">
the con&s;titution which the Jacobins di&s;approve, they are tho&s;e very points which the&s;e per&s;ons would bind on their po&s;terity for ever. Even among the patriots there are many who think that, the con&s;titution being now e&s;tabli&s;hed, the deliberations of the Jacobins are no longer ne|ce&s;&s;ary, and who al&s;o think that that &s;ociety leans too much towards republicani&s;m.</P>
<P>There are in France &s;everal different &s;ects of patriots; but the two leading parties and tho&s;e who are reproachfully termed by each other, <HI>enrag&eacute;s</HI> and <HI>mod&eacute;r&eacute;s;</HI> and the great features of difference between the&s;e parties &s;eem to be that the erag&eacute;s place the declaration of rights above the con&s;titution, while the mod&eacute;r&eacute;s place the con&s;titution above the declaration of rights. Each party is as dogmatical as the former doc|tors of the Sorbonne. But a Frenchman never di&s;putes with calmne&s;s on any &s;ubject: it were therefore unrea&s;onable to expect he &s;hould throw a&s;ide the natural impetuo&s;ity of his charac|ter, on the very points mo&s;t likely to call it forth.</P>
<P>This accounts, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, for the vio|lent tumults which &s;ometimes ari&s;e in the Na|tional A&s;&s;embly; while in our Hou&s;e of Com|mons debates are carried on with the mo&s;t per|fect good order and tranquillity. Another rea|&s;on, however, may be a&s;&s;igned for this, be&s;ides
<PB N="74" REF="025039_0076_0FCDAC36922AC5A8">
the difference of national character. In the Hou&s;e of Commons our great orators may be as eloquent as they will; they may do honour to our nation, and to the age in which they live, by the energy, the &s;ublimity of their talents; but every body knows that their eloquence does not influence even one &s;olitary vote; and before a debate begins, all the world is well appri&s;ed how the bu&s;ine&s;s will end.</P>
<P>This is not the ca&s;e in the National A&s;&s;embly. There, arguments and votes have &s;till a connec|tion with each other; and therefore every point is di&s;cu&s;&s;ed with vehemence.&mdash;But to return to the Jacobins&mdash;If they have many enemies, the party of their friends is far more numerous. Tho&s;e per&s;ons declare that they never enter the hall of the Jacobins without re&s;pect, becau&s;e they con&s;ider it as the cradle and the &s;anctuary of French liberty. They are convinced that tho&s;e watchful, vigilant, jealous, noi&s;y Jacobins are its be&s;t guardians; and that but for the ex|ten&s;ive influence which they have acquired, in con&s;equence of their corre&s;pondence with the other partriotic &s;ocieties, e&s;tabli&s;hed in every part of the kingdom, with whom they con&s;tantly maintain a chain of connection, the infant lib|erty of France would have been cru&s;hed in its birth by its numerous and formidable enemies. The friends of the Jacobins believe that they are
<PB N="75" REF="025039_0077_0FCDAC382663DD98">
very far from intending to overthrow the pre&s;ent &s;y&s;tem, whatever &s;peculative opinions &s;ome of the members of that &s;ociety may have on the &s;ubject of government: but that, if the Jacobins &s;hould find that corruption is &s;uffered to taint the purity of the new con&s;titution and impede its march&mdash;if it &s;hould be found that the fir&s;t National A&s;&s;embly, after having formed that con&s;titution upon the great and everla&s;ting ba&s;is of the rights of man, and of which the Abb&eacute; Sieyes has the glory of having laid the corner|&s;tone in drawing up the declaration of tho&s;e rights&mdash;if it &s;hould be found that that a&s;&s;embly, after &s;u&s;taining a long and laborious &s;truggle, at length wearied of the conflict, &s;hould &s;uffer the beautiful work they had created to be deformed in the revi&s;ion of it&mdash;if it &s;hould be found that the con&s;titution, in its pre&s;ent &s;tate, is like an ill-con&s;tructed carriage, and that it is in the pow|of the drivers to put &s;ome &s;ecret clogs upon the wheels, and prevent its going forward, while the patriots in vain la&s;h up the hor&s;es&mdash;then, it is &s;aid, the Jacobins will warn the people of the threatened danger, with that bold, that ardent eloquence which belongs to the apo&s;tles of lib|erty.</P>

<P>The names of Milton, of Locke, and of Hambden, re-echoed through the hall, where it was propo&s;ed that their bu&s;ts &s;hould al&s;o in a &s;hort time be placed. I heard with exultation the well-known names of the&s;e celebrated per&s;ons, and recollected with pride that I had the honour
<PB N="77" REF="025039_0079_0FCDAC3D0F3CECB8">
of belonging to the &s;ame country. Surely that nation which produced the writings of Milton and of Locke, which gave birth to Sidney and Hambden, in ages when the re&s;t of Europe were &s;laves, has a claim to the everla&s;ting grati|tude and admiration of mankind.</P>
<P>In this enlightened period of the world more perfect &s;y&s;tems of legi&s;lation may perhaps be formed than England can boa&s;t. <HI>Her</HI> Magna Charta was obtained not in the illumination of the eighteenth, but in the Gothic darkne&s;s of the twelfth century. <HI>She</HI> can never be deprived of the mo&s;t glorious pre-eminence among the children of freedom; <HI>&s;he,</HI> who cheri&s;hed in her bo&s;om the noble &s;entiments of liberty, when the nations around her were &s;unk in the mo&s;t abject &s;ervitude.

<P>THE fir&s;t National A&s;&s;embly, amid&s;t the greatne&s;s and extent of its labours, was obliged to leave to a &s;ucceding a&s;&s;embly the ta&s;k of in&s;tituting a plan of public education; a ta&s;k which will &s;oon occupy the pre&s;ent legi&s;lature, and will alone &s;erve to immortalize it, if well performed.</P>

It is &s;aid, that Mon&s;ieur Condorcet, a member of the pre&s;ent National A&s;&s;embly, is at pre&s;ent employed on this object; and there can be no doubt that he will execute the work he has un|dertaken with that philo&s;ophical &s;pirit, and that exten&s;ive knowledge, which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es in &s;o con&s;picuous and eminent a degree.</P>
<P>How many &s;oothing, how many comprehen|&s;ive and &s;ublime ideas does this plan of public education include! There is &s;omething infi|nitely agreeable and delightful to the imagination in the anticipation of that progre&s;s which the ri&s;ing generation in this country may make in rea&s;on, in philo&s;ophy, in virtue, and in happi|ne&s;s; and the improvement of the ri&s;ing gener|ation cannot but be highly intere&s;ting to the friends of the French revolution, &s;ince it &s;eems peculiarly for them that that revolution has been made.

<P>Mirabeau had drawn out a plan of public in|&s;truction, which he meant to pre&s;ent to the National A&s;&s;embly; and he intended, when this que&s;tion was di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, to propo&s;e at the &s;ame time the abolition of the literary academies, or rather corporations of Paris, which he con&s;idered as incompatible with the &s;pirit of a free con&s;ti|tution, and as injuring in&s;tead of &s;erving the cau&s;e of letters.</P>
<P>Mon&s;. Chamfort, a member of the French academy, had, at Mirabeau's de&s;ire, written a di&s;cour&s;e on the &s;ubject of that academy, which the death of Mirabeau prevented his reading at the ritbune of the National A&s;&s;embly. It is a

fact well known in France, that Mirabeau eag|erly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ought and accepted the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;uch men as as he thought were capable of furni&s;h|ing him with ideas worthy of his own high rep|utation.&mdash;There was certainly a want of delicacy in thus wearing, without &s;cruple, as he frequently did, tho&s;e laurels which were the right of an|other.

<P>The Lyc&eacute;e was formed in 1785, under the

Of their knowledge in the different &s;ciences they teach, I, in my ignorance, am little qualified to judge.

<P>YOU have heard no doubt that we have had a fete at Paris, on account of the arrival of the &s;oldiers de Chateau-Vieux: but to give you an idea of all the di&s;turbance, ani|mo&s;ity, quarrels, and contention, which prece|ded this <HI>civic</HI> f&ecirc;te, would be &s;omewhat difficult. For a fortnight before it took place the whole town of Paris was thrown into the mo&s;t violent agitation. The approaching war &s;eemed for|gotten. Francis might threaten, and Pru&s;&s;ia might arm; but all con&s;ideration of foreign af|fairs

was laid a&s;ide, and the &s;oldiers of Chateau-Vieux &s;olely occupied the public attention. This Swi&s;s regiment, called the Chateau-Vieux, was one of tho&s;e regiments which were encamp|ed in the Champ de Mars before the revolution, and which were de&s;tined to ma&s;&s;acre the Pari|&s;ians, di&s;&s;olve the &s;tates-general, and lay wa&s;te the city of Paris. But the &s;oldiers of Chateau-Vieux di&s;dained to act the part which had been a&s;&s;igned them in this bloody tragedy: they refu|&s;ed to become the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins of the Pari&s;ians, and declared to their officers their re&s;olution to break their arms in pieces, &s;ooner than employ them again&s;t the citizens. That &s;oldiers &s;hould dare before they drew their &s;words to deliberate whether the cau&s;e was ju&s;t&mdash;that when the word of command for murder was given, they &s;hould refu&s;e to obey, becau&s;e murder is a crime&mdash;was an example of morality, which, if it be|came contagious, would, it was immediately felt, prove ab&s;olutely de&s;tructive to the good old cau&s;e of arbitrary power; and it was re&s;olved to puni&s;h the &s;oldiers of Chateau-Vieux for hav|ing dared to <HI>rea&s;on,</HI> when <HI>fighting</HI> was the only thing for which they had received orders.</P>
<P>The regiment of Chateau-Vieux was &s;ent to Nancy in that divi&s;ion which Bouill&eacute; command|ed, and there Bouill&eacute;, who had already formed

his plan of trealon, attempted to light up the flames of civil war. He led the national guards, collected in ha&s;te from the neighbouring muni|cipalities, again&s;t the citizens of Nancy. The &s;oldiers of Chateau-Vieux defended th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;e citi|zens; both parties were in the mo&s;t fatal error; a profu&s;ion of blood was &s;hed; and Bouill&eacute; on this occa&s;ion acted a fit prelude to that de&s;ign of betraying his country which he had formed at the very moment when he accepted the com|mand of the con&s;iderable force, and had &s;worn fidelity to the new government. Compared to the ba&s;ene&s;s of &s;uch conduct, the bold open defiance of the party at Coblentz has &s;omething in it manly and honourable.</P>
<P>The day after the action at Nancy, when the &s;treets were &s;trewed with dead bodies, among which were two hundred &s;oldiers of Chateau-Vieux, Bouill&eacute; a&s;&s;embled a council of war, which condemned twenty-two &s;oldiers of this regi|ment to be hanged, and one to be broke upon the wheel.

Forty &s;till &s;urvived, and the National A&s;&s;embly pa&s;&s;ed a decree for their deliverance. This decree re|mained long un&s;anctioned; but, in the mean time, the &s;oldiers of Chateau-Vieux received from the patriots of Bre&s;t, all the &s;upport and con&s;olation which their &s;ituation admitted. The ladies of Bre&s;t vi&s;ited the galley where they were chained, and &s;hed tears upon their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">etters, while the patriots of Paris wearied the mini&s;ters with applications in their behalf, and the decree at length received the royal a&s;&s;ent. The &s;oldiers of Chateau-Vieux left Bre&s;t and came to Paris, in order to offer the tribute of their gratitude at the bar of the National A&s;&s;em|bly, and to declare that the only u&s;e they de&s;ired to make of the liberty to which they were re&s;tored, was that of &s;hedding the la&s;t drop of their blood for the French nation.</P>
<P>On their way from Bre&s;t to Paris, they were received in every town through which they pa&s;|&s;ed with the mo&s;t cordial welcome. They were con&s;idered as the victims of the common cau&s;e; fetes were prepared for their reception; and ble&s;&s;ings were poured forth upon the Na|tional A&s;&s;embly for having re&s;tored them to liberty.</P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="025039_0098_0FCDAC614F84E680">
The people of Paris feeling the &s;ame impre&s;|&s;ions, determined al&s;o to prepare a f&ecirc;te for their reception. The citizens made a voluntary con|tribution for this purpo&s;e, and the plan of a very magnificent proce&s;&s;ion was formed. But here the tale of di&s;cord begins. The enemies of the public peace &s;aw in this projected f&ecirc;te an oppor|tunity of fomenting di&s;order and troubles, too favourable to be lo&s;t. Reports were rapidly circulated through Paris, that this triumphal entry of the &s;oldiers of Chateau-Vieux was in|tended as an in&s;ult to the national guard, who had fought again&s;t them. Placards on this &s;ub|ject were pa&s;ted up in every &s;treet, hand-bills were di&s;tributed, incendiary pamphlets were publi&s;hed, the minds of the people became infla|med: it was a&s;&s;erted that the f&ecirc;te would end in a ma&s;&s;acre&mdash;in &s;hort, every thing was a&s;&s;erted that pa&s;&s;ion and party-rage could &s;ugge&s;t.</P>
<P>The citizens, however, had gone too far to recede: the f&ecirc;te took place, and was the more &s;ingular and intere&s;ting from being &s;tripped of much of its intended &s;plendour. No per&s;on was &s;uffered to carry arms, and the &s;oldiers of Chateau-Vieux, in&s;tead of mounting a trium|phal car which had been prepared for them, were mixed undi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters">gui&s;hed with the crowd. The f&ecirc;te, however, notwith&s;tanding the gloomy

augurs which had preceded it, pa&s;&s;ed without the &s;malle&s;t di&s;order.</P>
<P>The people, who were a&s;&s;embled to the num|ber of between three and four hundred thou&s;and, formed their own police: and, finding &s;ome difficulty at &s;etting out in mar&s;halling the pro|ce&s;&s;ion, every one being ambitious to have a place near the triumphal car of liberty, a gard|ener picked a wheat-ear, with which the people con&s;ented to regulate the order of the march, and wherever the wheat-ear was carried, imme|diately ranged them&s;elves in good order.</P>
<P>Thus mar&s;halled by a wheat-ear, in&s;tead of being kept in their places as formerly by the point of bayonets, the people, whom their ene|mies had accu&s;ed of the mo&s;t dark and atrocious de&s;igns, advanced towards the Champ de Mars, indulging them&s;elves in all the enthu&s;ia&s;m of &s;imple and affectionate joy.

They could a&s;&s;ociate no ideas of patrioti&s;m with the Palais de Bourbon, and accu&s;ed us of ari&s;tocracy as they approached. But they did not remain long in this error. They &s;oon perceived that we were entirely di&s;po&s;ed to &s;ympathize in their fe&s;tivity, and al&s;o that part of the company were Engli&s;h women: while the gentlemen from our windows repeatedly called out in as loud voices as they could.

<P>I have ju&s;t heard an intere&s;ting circum&s;tance relating to a &s;oldier of Chateau-Vieux, who is now come to Paris in order to meet his old comrades. This young man was of the num|ber of tho&s;e whom the council of war at Nan|cy had condemned to die. He had gained the affections of a girl who was an inhabitant of
<PB N="99" REF="025039_0101_0FCDAC6448E8EDF8">
Nancy. With that angui&s;h of heart which tho&s;e who have loved can perhaps conceive, and which to tho&s;e who have not it were vain to de&s;cribe, this unhappy girl &s;aw her lover led to execution. The gloomy proce&s;&s;ion pa&s;&s;ed by the hou&s;e in which &s;he lived; and in the confu|&s;ion, the tumult, and di&s;order occa&s;ioned by the number of &s;oldiers who were led together to execution, and by the rage, the de&s;pair, the vio|lnt emotions which agitated the &s;pectators, this girl contrived to &s;natch her lover from the fate that threatened him, and concealed him in a gar|ret of the hou&s;e &s;he inhabited. How &s;he effec|ted this, it is difficult to imagine: but you are not ignorant that love is fertile in expedients; and however it happened, the fact certain. In this garret the young man lived concealed from every eye but that of his mi&s;tre&s;s, and &s;u&s;tained by the food which &s;he purcha&s;ed with the labour of her hands and which &s;he brought to him in &s;ecret. You will imagine the plea&s;ure with which &s;he toiled to &s;upply the wants of her lov|er, and the tears of tenderne&s;s and gratitude with which he bathed the hand that mini&s;tred to his nece&s;&s;ities.

arrived at Nancy in &s;earch of his &s;on. In vain he &s;ought him, in vain he que&s;tioned every per&s;on he met concerning him; no tidings, no traces of him were to be &s;ound. The wretched pa|rent wandered up and down the &s;treets of Nancy in de&s;pair. At length he was told that there was a young per&s;on in the town to whom his &s;on had been much attached; and he was direc|ted to the hou&s;e where the young man lay con|cealed. The girl, when que&s;tioned about her lover, at fir&s;t &s;u&s;pected &s;ome treachery&punc; and deni|ed having any knowledge of what had befallen him. But &s;he &s;oon perceived in the tears which &s;treamed plentifully down the old man's cheeks, in the agony which &s;eemed to be bend|ing his grey hairs to the grave, the genuine feelings of nature. She wept with him, and at length told him, that if he would call the fol|lowing day, &s;he would perhaps have it in her power to give him &s;ome tidings of his &s;on. The old man departed: the girl flew to her lover, to whom &s;he de&s;cribed his figure, and the young man recognized the image of his father. The next day when the old man returned, the girl led him in &s;ilence to the chamber where his &s;on was concealed.

<P>You have heard, no doubt, of the appoint|ment which has lately been made of patriotic mini&s;ters, all of whom belong to that &s;ociety again&s;t which the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria is going to open a campaign. It is to be hoped that, un|der the au&s;pices of this Jacobin mini&s;try, the affairs of the &s;tate will be conducted with more energy, unanimity, and order, than they have hitherto been. For though the French have not yet engaged in foreign war, ho&s;tilities have long ago commenced between the executive and legi&s;lative powers, and a warm fire has been kept up on both &s;ides. The union which the&s;e two powers formed together when the king &s;igned the con&s;titution, has gone on as many modern marriages do, in quarrels and conten|tion, and might perhaps have ended in a divorce, but for the &s;alutary intervention of this new mini&s;try, which po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the confidence of the people.</P>

The gentleman, who is an enthu&s;ia&s;tic patriot, immediately took alarm. He concluded that &s;ome fre&s;h calamity had taken place; that &s;ome new combination of foreign powers was formed again&s;t the liberty of France; and in|quired with the utmo&s;t earne&s;tne&s;s what had hap|pened.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Would you believe that the mini&s;ter was even without buckles!</HI></NOTE> "Imaginez-vous," re&s;umed the at|tendant, "que le mini&s;tre n'avoit pas <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> ne de boucles!</P>
<P>All, however, that can be expected from min|i&s;ters without buckles, I have no doubt the pre&s;|ent mini&s;try will perform.

and in &s;uch parts of it as want intere&s;t, I beg you will recollect that you are not reading a tale of fiction; and that in real life incidents are not always placed as they are in novels, &s;o as to produce &s;tage effect. In &s;ome parts of the nar|rative you will meet with a little romance; but perhaps you will wonder that you meet with no more; &s;ince the &s;cene is not in the cold philo|&s;ophic climate of England, but in the warm regions of the &s;outh of France, where the imag|ination is elevated, where the pa&s;&s;ions acquire extraordinary energy, and where the fire of poetry fla&s;hed from the harps of the Trouba|dours amid&s;t the &s;ullen gloom of the Gothic ages.</P>

is therefore &s;eldom re&s;orted to by any but people of con&s;iderable fortune, who can afford to level the ob&s;tacles which mountains interpo&s;e to their conveniences and comforts, by the all-&s;ubduing force of gold.</P>
<P>Among a number of per&s;ons of rank and for|tune, there was however one family at Bareges in a different &s;ituation. This family con&s;i&s;ted of an elderly infirm French officer, who had long been afflicted with the pal&s;y, and his daugh|ter a young woman about nineteen years of age. Their appearance and mode of living &s;eemed to indicate, that, though in &s;earch of relief this old officer had journeyed to Bareges, he had in &s;o doing far exceeded the bounds of economy which his circum&s;tances pre&s;cribed, and was forced to deny him&s;elf every accommodation his infirmities could &s;pare. He lived in the mo&s;t retired manner, in the wor&s;t lodging at Bareges; and, while the other ladies were dre&s;|&s;ed in a &s;tyle of expen&s;ive variety and profu&s;ion, his daughter wore only a plain linnen gown, which, though always perfectly clean, was coar&s;e; and her dark hair was left unpowdered and without any ornament whatever. Fortu|nately for Madelaine however (for that was her name) her per&s;on was calculated to make her coar&s;e gown appear to the be&s;t advantage; and
<PB N="109" REF="025039_0111_0FCDAC6FEF436D20">
though &s;he was not very beautiful, her counte|nance had an expre&s;&s;ion of &s;weetne&s;s which an|&s;wered the end of beauty by exciting love and admiration.</P>
<P>The company at Bareges &s;oon became ac|quainted with each other, and the ladies always took notice of Madelaine when they met her in their walks, which however did not happen very often, for her father was frequently unable to go out. When he did, he was &s;upported on one &s;ide by Madelaine, and on the other by his &s;er|vant. It was impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ee with in&s;en&s;ibility the attention which this intere&s;ting young wo|man paid her father, whom &s;he never quitted one moment. It was remarked with what careful tenderne&s;s &s;he u&s;ed to lead him along the &s;treets of Bareges, walking the &s;lowe&s;t pace &s;he could, and watching his &s;teps as he moved feebly on. And when he was not able to ven|ture out, &s;he was &s;een at the window of their little parlour reading in order to entertain him. Her looks and manner announced that her di&s;|po&s;ition was naturally &s;prightly, and that &s;he would have been gay, if her father had not been &s;ick. But all the cheerfulne&s;s &s;he could a&s;&s;ume while he &s;uffered, was exerted to amu&s;e him, and &s;horten the tedious hours of languor and debility.</P>
<P>Though Madelaine was hand&s;ome, the ob&s;cu|rity

and &s;eclu&s;ion in which &s;he lived pre&s;erved her from the envy of the women. They knew well enough that the gentleman at Bareges were for the mo&s;t part men of the world, who, though they may admire beauty, and approve of virtue, are never &s;o far the dupes of any tender of moral &s;entiment as to let it interfere either with their vanity, their ambition, or their intere&s;t. Al|though the French revolution had not yet hap|pened, the&s;e ladies were aware that, with re&s;pect to marriage, the age of <HI>calculators</HI> was already come, and therefore no rival was to be feared in Madelaine. The ladies joined with the men in admiring the graces of her per&s;on, and the amiable qualities which her conduct di&s;played. Madelaine in &s;hort became the object of general e&s;teem.</P>
<P>Augu&s;te, for &s;o I &s;hall call our young Pari&s;ian, who has lo&s;t his title &s;ince the laws of equality have be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> e&s;tabli&s;hed in his country&mdash;Augu&s;te &s;poke l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> of Madelaine than the other gentle|men at Bareges; but it was perhaps becau&s;e he thought of her more. Sometimes in his &s;olitary morning rambles he u&s;ed to make compari&s;ons between her and the Pari&s;ian ladies among whom he had pa&s;&s;ed the winter, and the com|pari&s;on generally ended with a deep &s;igh. The &s;cene of the&s;e meditations was certainly much
<PB N="111" REF="025039_0113_0FCDAC71CA75BC00">
in Madelaine's favour. Perhaps at Paris or Ver&s;ailles, Augu&s;te might have been dazzled by the poli&s;hed graces of a fine lady rouged, powdered, per&s;umed, and equipped for conque&s;t. The&s;e artificial attractions might perhaps have accorded well enough with clipped trees and an|gular walks. But Madelaine's &s;imple manners, Madelaine's natural &s;miles and un&s;tudied blu&s;hes were far more in uni&s;on with the Pyrenean mountains.</P>
<P>One evening, when Augu&s;te was walking in the town of Bareges with &s;ome ladies, he &s;aw Madelaine at a little di&s;tance a&s;&s;i&s;ting with great difficulty to &s;upport her father, who appeared to be &s;eized with a fit. Augu&s;te darted like an arrow towards the &s;pot, and held up the officer till he found him&s;elf &s;omewhat recovered; and then Augu&s;te, with a &s;ort of gentle violence, obliged Madelaine, who was pale and trembling, to let go her father's arm, and &s;uffer him to a&s;&s;i&s;t the &s;ervant in leading him home, which was but a few &s;teps farther. Augu&s;te entered the hou&s;e, where he remained till the old officer was a little revived; and, after prevailing upon Ma|delaine to take a few hart&s;horn drops, he retired.</P>
<P>The next morning he felt that common civil|ity required he &s;hould pay the old officer a vi&s;it, and learn how he had pa&s;&s;ed the night. It hap|pened
<PB N="112" REF="025039_0114_0FCDAC140870BC70">
that Madelaine had the very &s;ame idea. "Surely," thought &s;he, "it will be very &s;trange if this young man, who was &s;o kind, &s;o careful of my father, and who made me take &s;ome harts|horn drops, &s;hould neglect to call and enquire after us." This idea had come acro&s;s her mind &s;everal times; and &s;he was meditating upon it at her father's bed&s;ide, when Augu&s;te was announced.</P>
<P>The old officer, who had all the fini&s;hed politene&s;s of his country and his profe&s;&s;ion, received him in the mo&s;t courteous manner; and, though he &s;poke with &s;ome difficulty, yet he was profu&s;e in acknowledgments for the &s;ervice Augu&s;te had rendered him. Madelaine's thanks were few and &s;imply expre&s;&s;ed; but the tone in which they were uttered was &s;uch that Augu&s;te felt he could have &s;acrificed his life to have de&s;erved them.</P>
<P>The old officer &s;till continued &s;ick, and there|fore Augu&s;te &s;till con&s;idered it as an indi&s;pen&s;i|ble mark of attention to go every day, and learn the &s;tate of his health. He al&s;o began to feel that the&s;e vi&s;its became every day more nece&s;&s;a|ry to his own happine&s;s. That happine&s;s was indeed embittered by many painful reflections He well knew that to obtain his father the Count de&mdash;'s con&s;ent to marry Madelaine,
<PB N="113" REF="025039_0115_0FCDAC76D6E2A098">
was as impo&s;&s;ible as it was for him&s;elf to conqu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> the pa&s;&s;ion &s;he had in&s;pired. He knew exactly the order in which his father's enquiries would run on this &s;ubject. He was aware that there were two interrogatories to be an&s;wered. The fir&s;t was&mdash;"How many thou&s;and livres has &s;he a year?" And the &s;econd&mdash;"Is &s;he noble?" And nothing could be more embarra&s;&s;ing than that the enquiry concerning fortune would, he was &s;ure, come fir&s;t; &s;ince that was the only article which could not be an&s;wered in a &s;atis|factory manner; for to Madelaine's family no objection could have been made. By the way, though the former nobility of France would not ab&s;olutely contaminate the pure &s;treams of noble blood by an union with the daughter of a <HI>rotu|rier,</HI> they had always &s;ufficient genero&s;ity to abate &s;ome generations of nobility in favour of a proper equivalent in wealth.</P>
<P>Augu&s;te, while he was convinced of the im|po&s;&s;ibility of obtaining his father's con&s;ent to his marriage, did not pay Madelaine one vi&s;it the le&s;s from that con&s;ideration; and when the u&s;ual hour of his vi&s;it arrived, he often &s;uddenly broke a chain of admirable rea&s;oning on the imprudence of his attachment, in order to ha&s;ten to the dwelling of her he loved. In a &s;hort time he cea&s;ed all kind of rea&s;oning on the &s;ub|ject,
<PB N="114" REF="025039_0116_0FCDAC16F5A9A008">
and abandoned his heart without re&s;erve to the mo&s;t violent and unconquerable pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Augu&s;te made a declaration to the old officer of the &s;entiment which his daughter had in&s;pi|red. The old gentleman mentioned it to Ma|delaine, and &s;he only an&s;wered by tears of which he perfectly under&s;tood the meaning. When Augu&s;te explained his &s;ituation with re&s;pect to his father, the officer de&s;ired him to think of his daughter no more. Augu&s;te felt that he might as well have de&s;ired him to cea&s;e to breathe. He continued his vi&s;its, and the officer was &s;oon reduced to that &s;tate of languor and debility which left him neither the power nor the wi&s;h to forbid them. His complaints increa&s;ed ev|ery day, and were attended with many alarming &s;ymptoms. The &s;ea&s;on for the waters of Bar|eges was now pa&s;t, and all the company left the place, except the old officer, who was too weak to be removed, and Augu&s;te, who, while Ma|delaine remained, had no power to tear him&s;elf from the &s;pot. In a few weeks the old officer felt that his dying hour was near. Augu&s;te knelt with Madelaine at his bed&s;ide&mdash;her voice was &s;uffocated by tears; and Augu&s;te had &s;carcely power to articulate in broken accents that he would devote his life to the happine&s;s of Madelaine. The old officer fixed his eyes with
<PB N="115" REF="025039_0117_0FCDAC794EF94850">
a look of tender anxiety upon his daughter, and &s;oon after expired. Madelaine mourned for her father with uncontrouled affliction, nor could all the attentions of her lover di&s;pel that angui&s;h with which her affectionate heart la|mented the lo&s;s of her parent.</P>
<P>The winter being far advanced, &s;he propo&s;ed to defer her journey to the di&s;tant province where &s;he and her father had lived, until &s;pring, and to place her&s;elf in the mean time in a con|vent not far from Bareges. Augu&s;te exerted all the eloquence of love to induce her to con|&s;ent immediately to a private marriage. She he&s;itated at this propo&s;al; and while they were conver&s;ing together on the &s;ubject, the door of the room in which they were &s;itting was &s;uddenly thrown open, and Augu&s;te &s;aw his father the Count de&mdash;enter. He had heard of the attachment which detained his &s;on at Bareges, and had ha&s;tened to tear him from the &s;pot before it was too late. He upbraided his &s;on with great bitterne&s;s, and began al&s;o to up|braid Madelaine: but there was &s;omething in her looks, her &s;ilence, and her tears, which &s;tifled the terms of haughty reproach in which he was prepared to addre&s;s her; and ordering his &s;on to leave the room, he de&s;ired to &s;peak to her alone. After explaining to her the ab&s;olute impo&s;&s;ibility
<PB N="116" REF="025039_0118_0FCDAC17CAE4A2A0">
of her being ever united to her &s;on, and his deter|mination to di&s;inherit him, and leave his whole fortune to his &s;econd &s;on, if Augu&s;te &s;hould per&s;i&s;t in his attachment to her&mdash;after endeav|ouring to awaken her pride and her genero&s;ity, he de&s;ired to know where &s;he propo&s;ed going. She told him her intention of placing her&s;elf immediately in the convent of&mdash;. He ap|proved of this de&s;ign, and left her to go to his &s;on. No &s;ooner was the door of the room &s;hut, than Madelaine gave way to tho&s;e tears which &s;he had &s;carcely been able to re&s;train while the Count was &s;peaking. She had never felt &s;o &s;en&s;ibly her orphan condition as at this moment; and the dear remembrance of her fond father was mingled with the agony of di&s;ap|pointed love.</P>
<P>Meantime the Count de&mdash;declared to his &s;on, that his only chance of ever obtaining his mi&s;tre&s;s depended on his ab&s;olute unconditional &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to his commands, and that he mu&s;t in&s;tantly attend him to Paris. Augu&s;te eagerly enquired what was to become of Madelaine; and his father told him that &s;he had determined to take refuge in the convent of&mdash;. Augu&s;te ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed to depart till he was allowed an interview with Madelaine. The Count
<PB N="117" REF="025039_0119_0FCDAC7AD03C0180">
was obliged to con&s;ent; but before he &s;uffered them to meet, he obtained a promi&s;e from Ma|delaine not to mention to her lover any particu|lars of the conver&s;ation which had pa&s;&s;ed be|tween her and the Count.</P>
<P>Augu&s;te, in this la&s;t interview with Made|laine, atoned for the cruel di&s;dain of his father, by the mo&s;t &s;olemn and pa&s;&s;ionate a&s;&s;urances of fidelity, not to be &s;haken by time or circum|&s;tance; and then, after attempting to leave the room &s;everal times, and returning a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> often, he at length tore him&s;elf away. Madelaine, when &s;he &s;aw him depart, felt that every earthly hope had vani&s;hed with him.</P>
<P>She &s;et out early the next morning for the convent of&mdash;; but not till after &s;he had &s;at for &s;ome time weeping in the chair which Au|gu&s;te u&s;ed to occupy.</P>
<P>Madelaine pa&s;&s;ed the remaining part of the winter in the convent of&mdash;, during which period &s;he received frequent letters from Augu&s;|te; and when &s;pring arrived he conjured her, in&s;tead of removing to her own province, to re|main a little longer in her pre&s;ent &s;ituation; and flattered her with hopes of being able ere long to fulfil tho&s;e engagements upon which all his hap|pine&s;s depended.</P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="025039_0120_0FCDAC7C4A2ECFC0">
In the &s;ummer of this year an event took place which will render that &s;ummer for ever memorable. The French nation, too enlight|ened to bear any longer tho&s;e mon&s;trous oppre&s;|&s;ions which ignorance of its ju&s;t rights alone had tolerated, &s;hook off its <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">etters, and the revo|lution was accompli&s;hed.</P>
<P>Madelaine was a firm friend to the revolution, which &s;he was told had made every Frenchman free. "And if every Frenchman is free," thought Madelaine "&s;urely every Frenchman may marry the woman he loves." It appeared to Madelaine, that, putting all political con&s;ider|ations, points upon which &s;he had not much meditated, out of the que&s;tion, obtaining liberty of choice in marriage was alone well worth the troubles of a revolution; and &s;he was as warm a patriot from this &s;ingle idea, as if &s;he had &s;tu|died the declaration of rights made by the Con|&s;tituent A&s;&s;embly, in all its extent and con&s;e|quences.</P>
<P>The Count de&mdash;, who was informed of the corre&s;pondence between the two lovers, and who &s;aw little hopes of his &s;on's &s;ubduing a pa&s;&s;ion which this intercour&s;e of letters &s;erved to cheri&s;h, contrived means to have Augu&s;te's letters intercepted at the convent. In vain Madelaine inquired with all the anxiety of ten|derne&s;s
<PB N="119" REF="025039_0121_0FCDAC19F454C250">
for letters. In vain &s;he counted the hours till the return of the po&s;t-days. Po&s;t after po&s;t arrived, and brought no tidings of Augu&s;te. Three months pa&s;&s;ed in the cruel torments of anxiety and &s;u&s;pen&s;e, and were at length &s;uc|ceeded by de&s;pair. Madelaine believed &s;he was forgotten&mdash;forgotten by Augu&s;te!&mdash;She con|&s;ulted her own heart, and it &s;eemed to her impo&s;|&s;ible; yet, after a &s;ilence of three months, &s;he could doubt no longer.</P>
<P>Poor Madelaine now recollected with an|gui&s;h, in&s;tead of plea&s;ure, that all Frenchmen were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ree. She would have found &s;ome &s;ad con&s;olation in believing that all Frenchmen were &s;laves. It would have been &s;ome allevia|tion of her &s;orrows if Augu&s;te had been forced to abandon her; and &s;he fancied &s;he could have borne to lo&s;e him, if &s;he had been &s;ure that he &s;till loved her&mdash;it was lo&s;ing him by his own fault that filled her heart with pangs almo&s;t in|&s;upportable.</P>
<P>The little pittance which Madelaine, after paying her father's debts, had left for her own &s;upport, was in&s;ufficient to defray her expences as a pen&s;ioner in the convent. She had already, by her &s;weetne&s;s and gentlene&s;s, gained the af|fections of &s;ome of the nuns, to whom &s;he was al&s;o attached, and who ince&s;&s;antly conjured her
<PB N="120" REF="025039_0122_0FCDAC1DF7A87D48">
to take the veil. "And why," &s;he &s;ometimes exclaimed, "why &s;hould I he&s;itate any longer in &s;o doing? Since Augu&s;te is lo&s;t, what have I to regret in renouncing the world? What &s;a|crifice do I make? What happine&s;s do I re&s;ign?"</P>
<P>Madelaine had no ties to the world, of which &s;he knew but little: but to &s;eparate her&s;elf irre|coverably, and for ever, from him to whom her &s;oul was devoted&mdash;to &s;ee him, to hear his voice no more&mdash;to take vows which would make it even a crime to think of him&mdash;to bani&s;h him even from her thoughts&mdash;alas! Madelaine felt like Eloi&s;a&mdash;
<Q><L><HI>All is not Heav'n's while Abelard has part,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Still rebel nature holds out half my heart!</HI></L></Q>
Sometimes too the idea occurred that Augu&s;te might love her &s;till&mdash;"And am I then," thought Madelaine, "going to reduce my&s;elf to a &s;tate in which I &s;hall be forced to wi&s;h he were un|faithful, in order to &s;ave me from the agonies of remor&s;e!"&mdash;She put off her thoughts of en|tering on her novitiate for &s;ome weeks longer&mdash;no letters arrived, and again her re&s;olution to take the veil returned. "Why," cried &s;he, "why &s;hould I &s;till continue to lament that incon&s;tant lover who thinks of me no more?
<PB N="121" REF="025039_0123_0FCDAC7FDE1AC1B0">
Alas, alas, did he not &s;ee the angui&s;h of my &s;oul at parting with him?&mdash;Does he not know the de&s;erted &s;ituation in which I am left?&mdash;Oh, yes! he knows I have no other refuge, no other re|&s;ource than taking the veil&mdash;no doubt he wi&s;hes to hear I have done &s;o&mdash;he will find in my re|nunciation of the world &s;ome excu&s;e for his in|fidelity&mdash;Oh, heavens! will Augu&s;te hear then that I am &s;eparated from him for ever without one &s;igh?&mdash;Ah, why need I deliberate any longer?&mdash;My trials will &s;oon be pa&s;t&mdash;I feel that my heart will break&mdash;yes, death will come to my relief&mdash;and in heaven I &s;hall find my father!"</P>
<P>Madelaine at length determined to join the holy &s;i&s;terhood of the convent. The white veil for her novitiate was prepared. The day was fixed, when, pro&s;trate with her face towards the earth, and with flowers &s;cattered over her, and a part of her long tre&s;&s;es cut off, &s;he was to enter upon that &s;olemn trial preparatory to her eternal renunciation of the world&mdash;of Augu&s;te!</P>
<P>A few days before that which was appointed for the ceremony, Madelaine was called to the parlour, where &s;he found her lover, with &s;ome of the municipal officers of the town, wearing their national &s;carfs.</P>
<P><PB N="122" REF="025039_0124_0FCDAC204EBA6E78">
Madelaine, at the &s;ight of Augu&s;te, with dif|ficulty reached a chair, in which &s;he fell back &s;en&s;ele&s;s; while Augu&s;te could not forbear utter|ing &s;ome imprecations again&s;t the iron grate by which they were &s;eparated, and which prevented him from flying to her a&s;&s;i&s;tance. He, how|ever, procured help, and Madelaine recovered.</P>
<P>One of the municipal officers then informed her, that they had received the day before a decree of the National A&s;&s;embly, forbidding any nuns to be profe&s;&s;ed. He added, that the muni|cipality had already given information of this new law to the abbe&s;s, who had con&s;ented to allow Madelaine to leave the convent immedi|ately. As he pronounced the&s;e la&s;t words, Ma|delaine looked at her lover. Augu&s;te ha&s;tened to explain to her that his uncle, who loved him and pitied his &s;ufferings, had at length made a will, leaving him his fortune upon condition that his father con&s;ented to his marriage with Madelaine.</P>
<P>When her lover and the municipal officers departed, Madelaine retired to her apartment, to give way to tho&s;e delicious tears which were poured from a heart overflowing with wonder, thankfulne&s;s, and joy. When her fir&s;t emotions had &s;ub&s;ided, &s;he began to pack up her little wardrobe in preparation for leaving the convent
<PB N="123" REF="025039_0125_0FCDAC81825A3FC8">
on the following day. "I always loved the revolution," thought Madelaine, as &s;he laid a&s;ide the white gown in which &s;he was to be married the next morning; "and this la&s;t de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ree is &s;urely of all others the be&s;t and wi&s;e&s;t&mdash;but if it had come too late!"&mdash;At this idea Madel|aine took up the veil for her novitiate, which lay upon her table, and bathed it with a flood of tears.</P>
<P>The next morning Augu&s;te and Madelaine were married in the pari&s;h-church of&mdash;, and immediately after the ceremony &s;et out for Par|is, where they now live, and are, I am told, two of the happie&s;t people and the be&s;t patriots in France.</P>

<P>A Cur&eacute; of my acquaintance is ju&s;t going to be married. He has had a literary di&s;|pute with the bi&s;hop of his dioce&s;e, on the right of the clergy to marry.

<HEAD>LETTER XXIII.</HEAD>
<P>I WRITE to you from Montre&uuml;il &s;ur Mer, where I &s;hall pa&s;s two or three weeks in my way to England. We left Paris the latter end of April, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ound the country covered with that fir&s;t fre&s;h tint of &s;pring which is &s;o lovely, but &s;o tran&s;ient. The trees were white with blo&s;&s;oms; and nature, full of youth, hope,
<PB N="126" REF="025039_0128_0FCDAC23085502C8">
and joy, wore the a&s;pect of all others the mo&s;t enchanting to the eye, and the mo&s;t &s;oothing to the imagination. Yet the contemplation of returning &s;pring naturally leads the mind to recal the &s;prings that are pa&s;t, and to take a retro&s;pect of life: and tho&s;e in whom &s;uch a retro&s;pect excites no melancholy reflections mu&s;t &s;urely be either peculiarly fortunate, or peculiarly in|&s;en&s;ible.</P>
<P>But, at the &s;ame time, we find in the lovely images which &s;pring pre&s;ents, a cure for tho&s;e gloomy reflections which the return of that &s;ea&s;on has perhaps awakened. For while we &s;ee nothing around us but images of beauty and delight, "while nothing &s;trikes the eye but &s;ights of bli&s;s," the darker &s;hades of care and &s;orrow vani&s;h, and leave only that gentle and tender melancholy which it is luxury to indulge&mdash;"that &s;adne&s;s of the countenance by which the heart is made better."</P>
<P>My mother found her&s;elf, one evening dur|ing our journey, &s;o much fatigued, that, in&s;tead of being able to reach Amiens, where we in|tended to &s;leep that night, we were obliged to &s;top at a very &s;mall village &s;ome leagues di&s;tant. The landlord of the little inn where we alighted, received us with an air of con&s;cious dignity and &s;elf importance which but ill accorded with the
<PB N="127" REF="025039_0129_0FCDAC83CC1F7848">
appearance of his dwelling. We enquired if he could furni&s;h us with beds: he &s;eemed offended at the que&s;tion, as implying in it &s;ome doubt, and an&s;wered with impatience,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>To be &s;ure, madam, as well as in the town.</HI></NOTE> "Mais, mad|ame, comme a la ville."&mdash;We <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ound, however, that the walls of the rooms where people were lodged "comme &agrave; la ville," were of bare brick. "What is the name of this place? &s;aid I to a ruddy-cheeked &s;ervant-girl who waited upon us."<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>This is Ser<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">eaux, madam, to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">bey you.</HI></NOTE> "Madame," &s;aid &s;he, "c'e&s;t Ser<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">eaux, pour pous ob&eacute;ir.".</P>
<P>The ma&s;ter of the inn having got the better of the ill-humour our fir&s;t enquiries had occa|&s;ioned, a&s;&s;ured us we &s;hould have an excellent &s;upper, and that he under&s;tood the art of cook|ery perfectly, having a&s;&s;i&s;ted &s;ome years in the kitchen of Madame la Prince&s;&s;e de Monaco. He by no means over-rated his talents; the &s;upper was extremely well dre&s;&s;ed. When we has &s;upped, the told us that we might con&s;ider our&s;elves as in perfect &s;afety under his roof; "for I, ladies," added he, in an elevated accent, "am the mayor of the village, and have two national guards every night at my door. I &s;a|ved the chateau of a per&s;on who was very odious to his pea&s;ants, from being burnt, by harangu|ing

the people, and convincing them of the enormity of the action; and my fellow-citizens, in gratitude for my &s;ervices on that occa&s;ion, unanimou&s;ly cho&s;e me for their mayor."</P>
<P>I congratulated Mon&s;. Le Maire on the hap|py effects of his eloquence, and he immediately &s;tepped out of the room, and returned with a national &s;carf in his hand, and a fierce grenadier's cap, which had been pre&s;ented to him as trophies of his patrioti&s;m. I enquired how many nation|al guards there were in the village. "No le&s;s than eighty men," &s;aid <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e; "and I am their "colonel." The honours, dignities, and high offices, civil and military, of our landlord, now crowded &s;o thick upon us, that we could &s;carcely reconcile our&s;elves to the trouble we gave him of bringing little moveable frames, for mattre&s;&s;es, into the room where we had &s;upped, and which the chief magi&s;trate arranged with admirable dexterity. Next morning we found he had thrown a&s;ide his white jacket, and was arrayed in the national uniform. When we recollected that our v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">alcutlets had been dre&s;&s;ed by a colo|nel, and our mattre&s;&s;es arranged by a mayor, we felt our&s;elves &s;omewhat in the &s;ituation of Don Quixote when queens &s;addled his hor&s;e, and duche&s;&s;es held his bridle.

by clapping his hand on his military cap.&mdash;Apropos of travelling&mdash;a French gentle|man of my acquaintance told me, that he was once going in his cabriolet from Paris to Calais, when he was acco&s;ted by a man who was walk|ing along the road, and who begged the favour of him to let him put his great coat, which he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ound very heavy, into the carriage. "With all my heart," &s;aid the gentleman; "but if we &s;hould not be travelling to the &s;ame place, how will you get your coat?"

<P>Montreuil is an old melancholy looking town, with no trade, and few inhabitants. Some families of little noble&s;&s;e who re&s;ided in this place, have thought proper to prove their nobil|ity by a trip to Coblentz. Their hou&s;es are left de&s;erted; gra&s;s grows in the &s;treets: and I expect to &s;ee the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ox which O&s;&s;ian mentions, looking out of the window.</P>
<P>Here are a great number of very ancient Gothic edifices; and one of them, near which we are lodged, affords me frequent &s;ubject of meditation. This is the Hotel-Dieu. In every town of France you find one of tho&s;e ho&s;pitals called Hotel-Dieu, where the &s;ick are attended by an order of nuns, who take
<PB N="130" REF="025039_0132_0FCDAC8D14A95E20">
vows to devote their lives to that purpo&s;e. The mo&s;t perfect cleanline&s;s and order reigns in the&s;e hou&s;es. But how great are the &s;acrifices made, from a principle of piety, by the&s;e nuns, many of whom are in the very bloom of youth! to devote life to the mo&s;t di&s;gu&s;ting occupations&mdash;to breathe only the air of contagion&mdash;to watch in &s;ad &s;ucce&s;&s;ion every &s;ixth or eighth night, through the long years of life, in the chambers of di&s;ea&s;e&mdash;to dre&s;s wounds&mdash;to perform for &s;trangers tho&s;e offices at which nature mo&s;t re|coils, and which we can &s;carcely fulfil without reluctance, even for tho&s;e to whom our &s;ouls are bound by the &s;tronge&s;t ties of duty and affection&mdash;to bear with unwearied patience the never-cea&s;|ing groans of tho&s;e that &s;uffer&mdash;to admini&s;ter, with that unfailing tenderne&s;s which long habit has not blunted, the remedies pre&s;cribed&mdash;to live among&s;t the dying&mdash;the&s;e &s;urely are &s;acri|fices which nothing but a &s;entiment of religion could in&s;pire&mdash;Surely it may be &s;aid of &s;uch per&s;ons, "Ye are not of this world!"</P>
<P>When we turn our thoughts from &s;uch a &s;cene as this, to that unfeeling indifference which prevails in the world&mdash;its &s;elfi&s;h pur&s;uit of its own intere&s;t&mdash;its eager &s;earch of its own gratifi|cations&mdash;its coldne&s;s to the pains of others&mdash;its vanities&mdash;its littlene&s;s&mdash;its luxuries&mdash;we find it at a di&s;tance &s;o remote from &s;uch virtue, that
<PB N="131" REF="025039_0133_0FCDAC8E61C366F0">
the nuns of the Hotels-Dieu appear like beings elevated above our pity, and only call forth ad|miration.</P>
<P>On Sunday la&s;t, after ve&s;pers, the tree of lib|erty was planted, with great rejoicings, in the middle of the &s;quare in which we live. A flag, from which &s;treamed the national colours, was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters">ened to the highe&s;t branches, crowned with a bonnet rouge. When this cheri&s;hed tree was firmly rooted in the earth amid&s;t the acclama|tions of the multitude, an officer of the national <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">uard mounted on a chair beneath the &s;hade of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span">, and read a paper of in&s;truction to the people, who formed a circle round him, and li&s;tened with the mo&s;t re&s;pectful attention. After de&s;canting upon the ble&s;&s;ings of the con|&s;titution, the orator enforced the nece&s;&s;ity of the mo&s;t ab&s;olute &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the laws.&mdash;The tree of liberty, with its green branches, and waving &s;treamers; the orator placed under its &s;hade; and the circle which &s;urrounded him, formed altogether a mo&s;t picture&s;que groupe.&mdash;There was &s;omething in the &s;cene which gave me an idea of the &s;implicity of ancient times. As &s;oon as the harangue was ended, a gun was fired; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ira, the beloved &s;ignal of gaiety, and ac|companiment of joy, was immediately played, while the people danced with all their hearts and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">uls.</P>
<P><PB N="132" REF="025039_0134_0FCDAC90459C4398">
We have had, indeed, no le&s;s than two trees of liberty planted in the &s;quare: for the little boys of the town anticipated the ceremony by planting a young tree, of which they had got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion the day before it took place. This young tree had al&s;o a bonnet rouge, made of paper, and colours compo&s;ed of the &s;ame mate|rials. It was not indeed very &s;teadily &s;eated in the earth, and might with propriety have been called<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Awavering liberty.</HI></NOTE> une libert&eacute; chancelante: but the winds did not vi&s;it it too roughly, and it kept its &s;ta|tion. A national guard of citizens, from &s;ix to twelve years of age, was mounted near the tree, armed, in ca&s;e of an attack, with wooden fu&s;ees. As we pa&s;&s;ed this formidable band, the captain demanded a few &s;ous to buy a drum<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot"><HI>For the nation.</HI></NOTE> pour la nation.

<HEAD>LETTER XXIV.</HEAD>
<P>I HAVE nothing to relate but what is mel|ancholy and painful. The repul&s;e which the French have met with at Tournay was tri|fling; and were it not, a defeat is the common chance of war, and would he an evil light indeed compared to the di&s;grace, the &s;hocking crimin|ality which has attended it. A <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ew days before I left Paris, the war with Germany was decla|red. The French, long in&s;ulted by the court of Vienna, rejoiced that the moment to a&s;&s;ert the injured honour of a great and gallant nation was at length arrived. They &s;aw before them, in long and radiant per&s;pective, city after city yielding to the arms of men who, renouncing
<PB N="134" REF="025039_0136_0FCDAC92CA1CC690">
all views of extending the French empire, only armed them&s;elves in defence of their ju&s;t rights, and who felt that
<Q><L><HI>Thrice is be arm'd that hath his quarrel ju&s;t.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>Forced to engage in a war again&s;t the tyrants of the earth, the French had declared (to tran&s;|late the words of Mon&s;. Condorcet, in his &s;ub|lime declaration made in the name of the Na|tional A&s;&s;embly) "that the &s;oldiers would con|duct them&s;elves in a foreign territory as they would have conducted them&s;elves on the terri|tory of France, had they been there forced to engage in combat; that even the accidental evils which the French troops might occa&s;ion to the people of tho&s;e foreign territories, &s;hould be repaired; that to repul&s;e violence, to re&s;i&s;t oppre&s;&s;ion, to forget injuries that were pa&s;t, to receive enemies reconciled, or di&s;armed, as bro|thers&mdash;&s;uch were the &s;entiments which the na|tion would find in the &s;ouls of Frenchmen, and &s;uch was the war which they declared again&s;t their enemies."</P>
<P>Thus had the French nation prepared every generous mind to e&s;pou&s;e its cau&s;e. No &s;oon|er was it made known that the armies on the frontiers &s;tood in need of recruits, than the
<PB N="135" REF="025039_0137_0FCDAC289302CE58">
young men in every province of France enli&s;ted them&s;elves with an ardour which only the &s;acred &s;entiment of liberty could have in&s;pired.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner was the war declared, than the bar of the National A&s;&s;embly was every day crowded with citizens, who according to their ability contributed, with fond enthu&s;ia&s;m, their mite towards the &s;upport of the common cau&s;e.</P>
<P>Little, indeed, did the people dream of defeat, but far le&s;s of di&s;honour.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>They murder men; it is the melancholy privilege of kings: but they cannot murder honour.</HI></NOTE> "On tue les hom|mes; c'e&s;t le tri&s;te apenage du m&eacute;tier des rois: mais on ne tue pas l'honneur;" that victim mu&s;t be offered by our&s;elves. Let us not, however, include the whole French nation in the di&s;grace of a few. The general gloom, indignation and horror, produced by the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inations at Li&s;le prove that the French feel with the keene&s;t &s;en|&s;ibility the di&s;honour incurred by &s;uch atrocious conduct.</P>
<P>I am per&s;uaded they will wipe away, by the performance of the mo&s;t noble and heroic actions, the &s;tain which has been ca&s;t upon the French arms.

<P>Let us al&s;o remember that the great cau&s;e of liberty remains uncontaminated by the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ina|tions at Li&s;le. Though fanatical bigots, in the rage of &s;uper&s;titious cruelty, have dragged their victims to the &s;take, would it be rational to extend our abhorrence of &s;uch actions to Chri&s;|tianity it&s;elf?&mdash;to that benevolent religion which inculcates univer&s;al charity, love, and good will towards men, and choo&s;e the comfortle&s;s, the &s;ullen indifference of athei&s;m.</P>
<P>And &s;hall we, becau&s;e the fanatics of liberty have committed &s;ome dete&s;table crimes, con|clude that liberty is an evil, and prefer the gloo|my

tranquillity of de&s;poti&s;m? If the ble&s;&s;ings of freedom have &s;ometimes been abu&s;ed, it is be|cau&s;e they are not yet well under&s;tood. Tho&s;e occa&s;ional evils which have happened in the infant &s;tate of liberty, are but the effects of de&s;|poti&s;m. Men have been long treated with inhumanity, therefore they are ferocious. They have often been betrayed, therefore they are &s;u&s;|picious. They have once been &s;laves, and there|fore they are tyrants. They have been u&s;ed to a &s;tate of warfare, and are not yet accu&s;tom|ed to univer&s;al benevolence. They have long been ignorant, and have not yet attained &s;ufficient knowledge. They have been con|demned to darkne&s;s, and their eyes are dazzled by light. The French have thrown a&s;ide the ritual of de&s;poti&s;m; but they have not all had time to learn the liturgy of that new con&s;titution which is laid upon the altar of their country. But the genuine principles of enlightened free|dom will &s;oon be better comprehended, and may perhaps at no di&s;tant period be adopted by all the nations of Europe. Liberty may bring "her &s;ons from afar, and her daughters from the ends of the earth."</P>
<P>The oppre&s;&s;ions which mankind have &s;uffered in every age, and almo&s;t in every country, will

<P>Then will the reign of humanity, of order, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">peace begin; the gates of Janus will be for ever clo&s;ed; liberty will extend her benign influence over the nations, and "ye &s;hall know her by her fruits."</P>
