<DIV2 TYPE="introduction">
<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>INASMUCH as there appears to us a real need of &s;uch an appeal, we would previ|ou&s;ly offer a few thoughts concerning the general nature of liberty and government, and then &s;hew wherein it appears to us, that our religious rights are encroached upon in this land.</P>
<P>It is &s;uppo&s;ed by multitudes, that in &s;ubmit|ting to government we give up &s;ome part of our liberty, becau&s;e they imagine that there is &s;omething in their nature incompatible with each other. But the word of truth plainly &s;hews, that man fir&s;t lo&s;t his freedom by breaking over the rules of government; and that tho&s;e who
<PB N="4" REF="012654_0003_0F8BBF656F02CE28">
now &s;peak great <HI>&s;welling words</HI> about <HI>liberty,</HI> while they <HI>de&s;pi&s;e government,</HI> are them&s;elves <HI>&s;er|vants of corruption.</HI> What a dangerous error, yea, what a root of all evil then mu&s;t it be, for men to imagine that there is any thing in the nature of true government that interferes with true and full liberty! A grand cau&s;e of this e|vil is, ignorance of what we are, and where we are; for did we view things in their true light, it would appear to be as ab&s;urd and dangerous, for us to a&s;pire after any thing beyond our ca|pacity, or out of the rule of our duty, as it would for the frog to &s;well till he bur&s;ts him&s;elf in try|ing to get as big as the ox, or for a bea&s;t or fowl to dive into the fi&s;hes element till they drown them&s;elves. <HI>Godline&s;s with contentment is great gain:</HI> But they that <HI>will</HI> take a contrary cour&s;e <HI>fall into temptation, and a &s;nare, and into many fooli&s;h and hurtful lu&s;ts, which</HI> DROWN <HI>men in de&s;truction and perdition.</HI> 1 Tim. 6. 6, 9.</P>
<P>The true liberty of man is, to know, obey and enjoy his Creator, and to do all the good unto, and enjoy all the happine&s;s with and in his fel|low-creatures that he is capable of; in order to which the law of love was written in his heart, which carries in it's nature union and benevo|lence to Being in general, and to each being in particular, according to it's nature and excellen|cy, and to it's relation and connexion to and with the &s;upreme Being, and our&s;elves. Each rational &s;oul, as he is a part of the whole &s;y&s;tem of rational beings, &s;o it was and is, both his du|ty and his liberty to regard the good of the whole in all his actions. To love our&s;elves, and
<PB N="5" REF="012654_0004_0F8BBF691A289438">
truly to &s;eek our own welfare, is both our liber|ty and our indi&s;pen&s;ible duty; but the conceit that man could advance either his honor or hap|pine&s;s, by di&s;obedience in&s;tead of obedience, was fir&s;t injected by the <HI>father of lies,</HI> and all &s;uch conceits ever &s;ince are as fal&s;e as he is.</P>
<P>Before man imagined that &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to go|vernment, and acting &s;trictly by rule was con|finement, and that breaking over tho&s;e bounds would enlarge his knowledge and happine&s;s, how clear were his ideas! (even &s;o as to give proper names to every creature) and how great was his honor and plea&s;ure! But no &s;ooner did he tran&s;gre&s;s, than in&s;tead of enjoying the bold|ne&s;s of innocency, and the liberties of paradi&s;e, he &s;neaks away to hide him&s;elf; and in&s;tead of clear and ju&s;t ideas, he adopted that ma&s;ter of all ab&s;urdities (which his children follow to this day) of thinking to hide from OMNICIENCY, and of trying to deceive HIM who knows every thing! In&s;tead of good and happine&s;s, he felt evil, guilt and mi&s;ery; and in the room of con|cord was wrangling, both again&s;t his Creator and his fellow-creature, even &s;o that &s;he who was be|fore loved as his <HI>own fle&s;h,</HI> he now <HI>accu&s;es</HI> to the great Judge. By which it appears, that the no|tion of man's gaining any dignity or liberty by refu&s;ing an intire &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to government, was &s;o delu&s;ive, that in&s;tead of it's advancing him to be <HI>as Gods,</HI> it &s;unk him down into a way of act|ing like the bea&s;ts and like the devil! the bea&s;ts are actuated by their &s;en&s;es and inclinations, and the devil pur&s;ues his de&s;igns by deceit and vio|lence. With malicious reflections upon God,
<PB N="6" REF="012654_0005_0F8BBF6944C279B0">
and flattering pretences to man, he drew him down to gratify his eyes and his ta&s;te with for|bidden fruit: and he had no &s;ooner revolted from the authority of heaven, than the beauty and order of his family was broken; he turns accu&s;er again&s;t the wife of his bo&s;om, his fir&s;t &s;on murders the next, and then lies to his Maker to conceal it; and that lying murderer's po&s;teri|ty were the fir&s;t who broke over the order of marriage which God had in&s;tituted; and things proceeded from bad to wor&s;e, till all fle&s;h had corrupted his way, and the earth was filled with violence, &s;o that they could no longer be borne with, but by a ju&s;t vengeance were all &s;wept a|way, only one family.</P>
<P>Yet all this did not remove the dreadful di&s;|temper from man's nature, for the great Ruler of the univer&s;e directly after the flood, gave this as one rea&s;on why he would not bring &s;uch ano|ther while the earth remains, namely, <HI>For the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth;</HI><NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 span"> and 6&punc; 13, 15, and 8. 21.</NOTE> &s;o that if he was to drown them as often as they de&s;erved it, one deluge mu&s;t follow another con|tinually. Ob&s;erve well where the di&s;temper lies; evil imaginations have u&s;urped the place of rea&s;on and a well informed judgment, and hold them in &s;uch bondage, that in&s;tead of be|ing governed by tho&s;e noble faculties, they are put to the horrid drugery of <HI>&s;eeking out inventions,</HI> for the gratification of <HI>fle&s;hly lu&s;ts, which war a|gain&s;t the &s;oul;</HI> and to guard again&s;t having the&s;e wor&s;t of all enemies detected and &s;ubdued. Enemies which are &s;o far from being God's crea|tures,

that &s;trictly &s;peaking, they have no being at all in them&s;elves, only are the privation of his creatures well-being; therefore &s;in with it's off|&s;pring death, will, as to tho&s;e who are &s;aved, be <HI>&s;wallowed up in victory.</HI> Sin is an enemy both to God and man, which was begotten by &s;atan, and was conceived and brought forth by man; for lu&s;t when it is conceived bringeth forth &s;in, and &s;in when it is fini&s;hed bringeth forth death.<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Eccl. 7. 29. 1 Pet. 2. 11.

<P>Now how often have we been told, that he is not a freeman but a &s;lave, who&s;e per&s;on and goods are not at his own but anothers di&s;po&s;al? And to have foreigners come and riot at our ex|pence and in the fruit of our labours, has of|ten been repre&s;ented to be wor&s;e than death. And &s;hould the higher powers appear to deal with temporal oppre&s;&s;ors according to their de|&s;erts, it would &s;eem &s;trange indeed, if tho&s;e who have &s;uffered intolerably by them, &s;hould employ all their art and power to conceal them, and &s;o to prevent their being brought to ju&s;tice! But how is our world filled with &s;uch madne&s;s con|cerning &s;piritual tyrants! How far have pride and infidelity, covetou&s;ne&s;s and luxury, yea de|ceit and cruelty, tho&s;e foriegners which came from hell, carried their influence, and &s;pread their baneful mi&s;chiefs in our world! Yet who is will|ing to own that he has been deceived and en|&s;laved by them? Who is willing hone&s;tly to bring them forth to ju&s;tice! All acknowledge that the&s;e enemies are among us, and many com|plain aloud of the mi&s;chiefs that they do; yet even tho&s;e who lift their heads &s;o high as to laugh
<PB N="8" REF="012654_0007_0F8BBF6A6CFB4DF8">
at the atonement of Je&s;us, and the powerful influ|ences of the Spirit, and &s;light public &amp; private de|votion, are at the &s;ame time very unwilling to own that they harbour pride, infidelity, or any other of tho&s;e dreadful tyrants. And nothing but the divine law refered to above, brought home with convincing light and power, can make them tru|ly &s;en&s;ible of the &s;oul-&s;lavery that they are in: and 'tis only the power of the go&s;pel that can &s;et them <HI>free from &s;in,</HI> &s;o as to become the &s;er|vants of <HI>righteou&s;ne&s;s:</HI> can <HI>deliver</HI> them from the&s;e <HI>enemies,</HI> &s;o as to <HI>&s;erve God in holine&s;s</HI> all their days. And tho&s;e who do not thus <HI>know the truth,</HI> and have not been <HI>made free</HI> thereby,<NOTE N="&para;" PLACE="foot">Rom. 6. 18. Luke 1. 74, 75. John 8. 32.</NOTE> yet have never been able in any country to &s;ub&s;i&s;t long without &s;ome &s;ort of government; neither could any of them ever make out to e&s;|tabli&s;h any proper government without calling in the help of the Deity. However ab&s;urd their notions have been, yet they have found human &s;ight and power to be &s;o &s;hort and weak, and a|ble to do &s;o little toward watching over the con|duct, and guarding the rights of individuals, that they have been forced to appeal to heaven by oaths, and to invoke a&s;&s;i&s;tance from thence to avenge the cau&s;e of the injured upon the guil|ty. Hence it is &s;o far from being nece&s;&s;ary for any man to give up any part of his real liberty in order to &s;ubmit to government, that all nati|ons have found it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ubmit to &s;ome government in order to enjoy any liberty and &s;ecurity at all.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="012654_0008_0F8BBF6B16568568">
We are not in&s;en&s;ible that the general notion of liberty, is for each one to act or conduct as he plea&s;es; but that government obliges us to act toward others by law and rule, which in the ima|gination of many, interferes with &s;uch liberty; though when we come to the light of truth, what can po&s;&s;ibly prevent it's being the highe&s;t plea&s;ure, for every rational per&s;on, to love God with all his heart, and his neighbour as him&s;elf, but corruption and delu&s;ion? which, as was be|fore noted, are foreigners and not originally be|longing to men. Therefore the divine argu|ment to prove, that tho&s;e who promi&s;e liberty while they de&s;pi&s;e government are &s;ervants of corruption is this; <HI>For of whom a</HI> MAN <HI>is o|vercome, of the &s;ame is he brought in bondage.</HI> 2 Pet. 2. 18, 19. He is &s;o far from being <HI>free</HI> to act the <HI>man,</HI> that he is a <HI>bond &s;lave</HI> to the wor&s;t of tyrants. And not a little of this tyran|ny is carried on by &s;uch an abu&s;e of language, as to call it liberty, for men to yield them&s;elves up, to be &s;o <HI>fooli&s;h, di&s;obedient</HI> and <HI>deceived,</HI> as to <HI>&s;erve divers lu&s;ts and plea&s;ures.</HI> Tit. 3. 3.</P>
<P>Having offered the&s;e few thoughts upon the general nature of government and liberty, it is needful to ob&s;erve, that God has appointed two kinds of government in the world, which are di&s;|tinct in their nature, and ought never to be con|founded together; one of which is called civil, the other eccle&s;ia&s;tical government. And tho' we &s;hall not attempt a full explanation of them, yet &s;ome e&s;&s;ential points of difference between them are nece&s;&s;ary to be mentioned, in order truly to open our grievances.</P>

<P>Some e&s;&s;ential points of difference between ci|vil and eccle&s;ia&s;tical government.</P>
<P N="1">1. The forming of the con&s;titution, and ap|pointment of the particular orders and offices of civil government is left to human di&s;cretion, and our &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion thereto is required under the name of their being, the <HI>ordinances of men</HI> for the Lord's &s;ake. 1 Pet. 2. 13, 14. Whereas in eccle&s;ia&s;tical affairs we are mo&s;t &s;olemnly warned not to be <HI>&s;ubject to ordinances, after the doc|trines and commandments of men.</HI> Col. 2. 20, 22. And it is evident that He who is the only worthy object of wor&s;hip, has always claimed it as his &s;ole prerogative, to determine by expre&s;s laws, what his wor&s;hip &s;hall be, who &s;hall mini&s;ter in it, and how they &s;hall be &s;upported. How ex|pre&s;s were his appointments concerning the&s;e things by Mo&s;es? And &s;o wi&s;e and good a ruler as Solomon, was not intru&s;ted with any legi&s;la|tive power upon either of the&s;e articles, but had the exact dimen&s;ions of the temple, the <HI>pattern</HI> and <HI>weight</HI> of every ve&s;&s;el, with the <HI>trea&s;uries</HI> of the <HI>dedicate things,</HI> and the <HI>cour&s;es</HI> of the <HI>Prie&s;ts and Levites,</HI> all given to him in <HI>writing by the Spirit,</HI> through the hand of his father David. 1 Chron. 28. 11&mdash;19. And &s;o &s;trict were God's faithful &s;ervants about the&s;e matters, that Da|niel who in a high office in the Per&s;ian court, be|haved &s;o well that his mo&s;t envious and crafty foes, could find no occa&s;ion again&s;t him, nor fault in him <HI>concerning the kingdom,</HI> till they fell upon the device of moving the king to make
<PB N="11" REF="012654_0010_0F8BBF6C97777A10">
a decree about wor&s;hip, that &s;hould interfere with Daniel's obedience to his God; yet when that was done, he would not pay &s;o much re|gard to it as to &s;hut his windows. Dan. 6. 4&mdash;11. And when the Son of God, who is the great Law-giver and King of his church, came and blotted out the hand-writing of the typical ordinances, and e&s;tabli&s;hed a better covenant, or con&s;titution of his church, upon better promi&s;es, we are a&s;&s;ured that he was <HI>faithful in all his hou&s;e, and counted worthy of more glory than Mo&s;es.</HI> What vacancy has he then left for fali|able men to &s;upply, by making new laws to re|gulate and &s;upport his wor&s;hip? e&s;pecially if we con&s;ider,</P>
<P N="2">2. That as the putting any men into civil of|fice is of men, of the people of the world; &s;o of|ficers have truly no more authority than the peo|ple give them: And how came the people of the world by any eccle&s;ia&s;tical power? They arm the magi&s;trate with the <HI>&s;word,</HI> that he may be a mini&s;ter of God <HI>to them for good,</HI> and might execute wrath upon <HI>evil doers;</HI> and for this cau&s;e they pay them <HI>tribute:</HI> upon which the apo&s;tle proceeds to name tho&s;e divine command|ments which are comprehended in love to our neighbour, and which work <HI>no ill to him.</HI> Sure|ly the in&s;pired writer had not forgotten the fir&s;t and great command of love to God; but as this chapter treats the mo&s;t fully of the nature and end of civil government of any one in the new-te&s;tament, does it not clearly &s;hew that the crimes which fall within the magi&s;trates juri&s;|diction to puni&s;h, are only &s;uch as work ill to
<PB N="12" REF="012654_0011_0F8BBF6DCA0B2EA8">
our neighbour? Rom. 13. 1&mdash;10. While church government re&s;pects our behaviour to|ward God as well as man.</P>
<P N="3">3. All acts of executive power in the civil &s;tate, are to be performed in the name of the king or &s;tate they belong to; while all our re|ligious acts are to be done in the <HI>name of the Lord Je&s;us;</HI> and &s;o are to be performed <HI>heartily as to the Lord, and not unto men.</HI> And it is but <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ervice,</HI> and <HI>vain wor&s;hip,</HI> if our <HI>fear toward him is taught by the precepts of men.</HI> Col. 3. 17, 23. I&s;a. 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> 13. Mat. 15. 9. It is often plead|ed, that magi&s;trates ought to do their duty in re|ligious as well as civil affairs. That is readily granted; but what is their duty therein? Surely it is to <HI>bow to the name of Je&s;us,</HI> and to &s;erve him with holy reverence; and if they do the contrary they may expect to <HI>peri&s;h from the way.</HI> Phil 2. 10. P&s;a. 2. 10&mdash;12. But where is the officer that will dare to come in the name of the Lord to demand, and forcibly to take, a tax which was impo&s;ed by the civil &s;tate! And can any man in the light of truth, maintain his character as a mini&s;ter of Chri&s;t, if he is not con|tented with all that Chri&s;t's name and influence will procure for him, but will have recour&s;e to the <HI>kings of the earth,</HI> to force money from the peo|ple to &s;upport them under the name of an em|ba&s;&s;ador of the <HI>God of heaven!</HI> Does not &s;uch conduct look more like the way of tho&s;e who made <HI>merchandize of &s;laves and &s;ouls of men,</HI> than it does like the <HI>&s;ervants</HI> who were content to be <HI>as their Ma&s;ter,</HI> who &s;aid, <HI>He that heareth you
<PB N="13" REF="012654_0012_0F8BBF6E54019500">
heareth me; and he that de&s;pi&s;eth you de&s;pi&s;eth me?</HI> Rev. 18. 9, 13. Luke 10. 3&mdash;16.</P>
<P N="4">4. In all civil governments &s;ome are ap|pointed to judge for others, and have power to compel others to &s;ubmit to their judgment: but our Lord has mo&s;t plainly forbidden us, ei|ther to a&s;&s;ume or &s;ubmit to any &s;uch thing in religion. Mat. 23. 1&mdash;9. Luke 22. 25&mdash;27. He declares, that the <HI>cau&s;e</HI> of his coming in|to the world, was to bear <HI>witne&s;s unto the truth;</HI> and &s;ays he, <HI>Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice.</HI> This is the nature of his <HI>Kingdom,</HI> which he &s;ay&punc; <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> not of this world:</HI> and gives that as the rea&s;on why his &s;ervants &s;hould not <HI>fight,</HI> or defend him with the <HI>&s;word.</HI> John. 18. 36, 37. And it appears to us that the true difference and exact limits between eccle&s;ia&s;tical and civil government is this, That the church is armed with <HI>light and truth,</HI> to pull down the &s;trong holds of iniquity, and to gain &s;ouls to Chri&s;t, and into his church, to be governed by his rules therein; and again to exclude &s;uch from their communion, who will not be &s;o governed; while the &s;tate is armed with the <HI>&s;word</HI> to guard the peace, and the civil rights of all per&s;ons and &s;o|cieties, and to puni&s;h tho&s;e who violate the &s;ame. And where the&s;e two kinds of go|vernment, and the weapons which belong to them, are well di&s;tingui&s;hed, and improved ac|cording to the true nature and end of their in|&s;titution, the effects are happy, and they do not at all interfere with each other: but where they have been confounded together, no tongue nor pen can fully de&s;cribe the mi&s;chiefs that have en&s;ued;
<PB N="14" REF="012654_0013_0F8BBF72AD6B8870">
of which the Holy Gho&s;t gave early and plain warnings. He gave notice to the church, that the main of tho&s;e antichri&s;tian confu&s;ions and abominations, would be drawn by philo&s;ophy and deceit, from the <HI>hand-writing of ordinances</HI> that Chri&s;t has <HI>blotted out.</HI> And to avoid the &s;ame, directs the &s;aints to walk in Chri&s;t Je&s;us <HI>as they received him,</HI> rooted and built up <HI>in him,</HI> and &s;tabli&s;hed in the faith <HI>as they have been taught;</HI> viewing that they are <HI>complete in him, which is the</HI> HEAD <HI>over</HI> ALL PRINCIPALITY <HI>and</HI> POWER. Therefore he charges them not to be beguiled into a <HI>voluntary humility,</HI> by &s;uch <HI>fle&s;h|ly minds</HI> as do not hold this <HI>Head,</HI> but would &s;ubject them to ordinances after the doctrines and commandments of men. Col. 2.</P>
<P>Now 'tis well known that this glorious Head made no u&s;e of &s;ecular force in the fir&s;t &s;itting up of the go&s;pel church, when it might &s;eem to be pecularly needful if ever; and it is al&s;o very evi|dent, that ever &s;ince men came into the way of u&s;ing force in &s;uch affairs, their main arguments to &s;upport it have been drawn from the old Jew|i&s;h con&s;titution and ordinances. And what work has it made about the head as well as mem|bers of the church?</P>
<P>Fir&s;t they moved Con&s;tantine, a &s;ecular prince, to draw his &s;word again&s;t heretics; but as all earthly &s;tates are changeable, the &s;ame &s;word that Con&s;tantine drew again&s;t heretics, Julion turned again&s;t the orthodox. However, as the high prie&s;t's &s;entence in the Jewi&s;h &s;tate, divided matters both for prince and people, the &s;ame de|ceitful
<PB N="15" REF="012654_0014_0F8BBF7501754A80">

our &s;ocieties, &s;o as not to allow them to be interrupted in their wor&s;hip; and as the taking cognizance of marriage belongs to them, we take it as a favour that they grant our mini&s;ters power to admini&s;ter it, &s;o that we may have marriage &s;olemnized among our&s;elves. Many other liberties we al&s;o enjoy under the govern|ment that is &s;et over us, for which we de&s;ire to be thankful, both to the Author, and to the in|&s;truments of them. Yet if our opponents could once put them&s;elves into our place, we doubt not but they would think it was high time, to &s;eek for more full liberty than we have hitherto en|joyed, a &s;hort view of but a little part of what we have met with, my be &s;ufficient to evince this.</P>
<P>Our charter, as before ob&s;erved, gives us e|qual religious liberty with other chri&s;tians: yet the pedobapti&s;ts being the greate&s;t party, they &s;oon made a perpetual law lo &s;upport their own way, but did nothing of that nature to exempt our denomination from it, for 36 years; and &s;ince that time, what they have done in that re&s;pect has only been by temporary acts, which have been &s;o often changed, that many times their own officers have hardly known what the law was, that was in force; and as an exact confor|mity to the letter of their laws is much in&s;i&s;ted upon in their executive courts, while tho&s;e acts have never been enforced with penalties upon their own people, they have often broken them, and we have had but little chance to get them puni&s;hed for &s;o doing. For in all their acts till the la&s;t, they have impo&s;ed a name upon us, that &s;ignifies <HI>re-baptizers,</HI> which we cannot under|&s;tandingly

own. In many acts the words, "be|longing thereto," were in&s;erted &s;o ambigou&s;ly, as to leave it di&s;putable, whether a being church members, or only a belonging to the congregati|on or wor&s;hipping a&s;&s;embly were intended; and in the ca&s;e of Haverhill, where their certificate was otherways compleat, and the ca&s;e had been determined in the bapti&s;ts favor, in that which both parties had agreed &s;hould be the final trial; yet another hearing was obtained, in which the want of them ambiguous words in the certificate, was made the main plea by which an action was turned again&s;t us, of near three hundred dollars. All their latter acts have required a li&s;t or li&s;ts of our &s;ocieties, to be given in annually by a certain day, &s;igned by three principal members, and the mini&s;ter if there be any; and becau&s;e one of our churches of above 50 members (and which is now a church in good credit) happened one year to have &s;uch a difficulty with their mi|ni&s;ter, as prevented the giving in of &s;aid li&s;t, they were taxed to pedobapti&s;t mini&s;ters; and tho' &s;ome of the &s;ociety were advi&s;ed to apply to their county court for relief, yet in&s;tead of obtaining any, the court took away 20 dollars more from them. Another church gave in their li&s;t by the direction of a noted lawyer, yet they were all taxed to the pedobapti&s;t wor&s;hip, and one of the principal members of the bapti&s;t church, which the law directed to &s;ign the li&s;t, was &s;trained up|on; and both the inferior and &s;uperior court turned the ca&s;e again&s;t him, becau&s;e he was a <HI>party concerned.</HI></P>
<P>Here note, the inhabitants of our mother-country are not more of a party concerned, in
<PB N="33" REF="012654_0032_0F8BBF878D7EAE70">
impo&s;ing taxes upon us without our con&s;ent, than they have been in this land who have made and executed laws, to tax <HI>us</HI> to uphold <HI>their wor&s;hip.</HI> This <HI>party influence</HI> has appeared in a much larger number of in&s;tances than we are willing to trouble the public with at this time; but one in&s;tance more will &s;et our ca&s;e in &s;uch a &s;triking light, that we mu&s;t a&s;k for a very &s;erious attention to it; we mean that of A&s;hfield, for|merly called Hunts-town in the county of Hamp|&s;hire. One of the conditions on which that plantation was granted by our legi&s;lature, was their &s;ettling a learned orthodox mini&s;ter, and building a meeting-hou&s;e. Now in the year 1761, full two thirds of the inhabitants called and &s;ettled a mini&s;ter, who they believed was taught of God and truly orthodox. But not being of the &s;ame mode with the court (for they were bap|ti&s;ts) other people were prompted on, before this &s;ociety could get up a meeting-hou&s;e, to &s;ettle another mini&s;ter, and to tax the fir&s;t mini&s;ter with all his people to &s;upport their way. This burden the bapti&s;ts bore for a number of years, till in 1768, they pre&s;ented a petition to our general court for relief; who ordered that they &s;hould &s;erve the town and proprietors of A&s;hfield with a copy of the petition, that they might &s;hew cau&s;e, if any they had, at the next &s;e&s;&s;ion of the court why it &s;hould not be granted, and that a further collection of taxes from the petitioners &s;hould be &s;u&s;pended in the mean time. Yet in the &s;ame &s;e&s;&s;ion of the court, a law was made which cut the bapti&s;ts in that place, off from any exemption from mini&s;terial taxes at all. In con&s;equence of which &s;everal hundred acres
<PB N="34" REF="012654_0033_0F8BBF884D790920">
of their lands were &s;old at public auction, for but a &s;mall part of their real value; of which ten acres belonged to the bapti&s;t mini&s;ter. And af|ter five or &s;ix journies of above an hundred miles to &s;eek relief, and long waiting without &s;uc|ce&s;s, their me&s;&s;enger was at la&s;t plainly told, by a number of our repre&s;entatives, <Q>That they had a right to make that law, and to keep the bapti&s;ts under it as long as they &s;aw fit.</Q> Hereupon notice was given in &s;ome Bo&s;ton pa|pers, of a de&s;ign among our churches of joining to &s;eek redre&s;s from another quarter.</P>
<P>Accordingly at an a&s;&s;ociation or general meet|ing of our churches at Bellingham, in Septem|ber, 1770, the&s;e things were con&s;idered, and it was unanimou&s;ly agreed upon to apply to his Ma|je&s;ty for help, if it could not &s;peedily be obtained here, and a committee and agents were cho&s;en for that purpo&s;e. When news hereof was &s;pread, our committee were urged by leading men both in church and &s;tate, to apply again to our gene|ral court; which therefore they did in October following. In the mean time a piece dated from Cambridge, where the court was then &s;itting, was publi&s;hed in all the Bo&s;ton news-papers, wherein it was repre&s;ented that, <Q>All po&s;&s;ible care had been taken to prevent our &s;uffering the <HI>lea&s;t di&s;advantage</HI> from our religious &s;en|timents;</Q> and we were challenged to &s;hew the contrary if we could.</P>
<P>Upon this the pious and learned Mr. John Davis, who from Penn&s;ylvania had not long before been ordained pa&s;tor of the &s;econd bap|ti&s;t

The&s;e are eight of the ten witne&s;&s;es that were &s;ummoned again&s;t Mr. Smith; &amp; tho' much pains was taken to procure evidence again&s;t him at the &s;uperior court, yet he was entirely acquit|ted; and the law was open for him to come back for damages, for a <HI>malicious pro&s;ecution;</HI> but they had contrived to have the complaint again&s;t him entered by a bankrupt, &s;o that no recompence might be obtained by him.

of la&s;t January, three men of good credit, be|longing to a numerous and regular bapti&s;t &s;ocie|ty in Chelmsford, were &s;eized for mini&s;terial rates (notwith&s;tanding they had given in a li&s;t according to law) and though one of them was above four &s;core years old, another very infirm in body, while the third had no man at home, able to take care of the out-door affairs of his numerous family, yet they, in that cold &s;ea&s;on, were all carried pri&s;oners to Concord goal.</P>
<P>The&s;e accounts we have received from good au|thority, and have taken great pains to have them &s;tated as exactly and truly as po&s;&s;ible; and if any can point out the lea&s;t mi&s;take in what has been now related, we &s;hall be glad to correct it. At the &s;ame time we are far from charging all the evils we complain of, upon the whole congregational denomination without di&s;tinction; for we believe there were many among them in various &s;tations, who are &s;orely grieved at the&s;e oppre&s;&s;ions. We are willing al&s;o to make all the allowance that is rea&s;onable, for the influence of old cu&s;toms, education and other prejudices, in tho&s;e who have injured their neighbours in the&s;e affairs; but is it not high time now to awake, and &s;eek for a more thorough reformation! We agree with the committee of our honored legi&s;lature in &s;aying, There is an e&s;&s;ential difference between per&s;ons being taxed <HI>where they are repre&s;ented,</HI> and being taxed where they are not &s;o; therefore the whole matter very much turns upon this point, viz. Whether our <HI>civil</HI> legi&s;lature are in truth our repre&s;entatives in <HI>religious</HI> affairs, or not? As God has always claimed it as his prerogative,

<P>In civil &s;tates the power of the whole collec|tive body is ve&s;ted in a few hands, that they may with better advantage defend them&s;elves again&s;t injuries from abroad, and correct abu&s;es at home, for which end a few have a right to judge for the whole &s;ociety; but in religion each one has an equal right to judge for him&s;elf; for we mu&s;t all <HI>appear</HI> before the judgment &s;eat of Chri&s;t, that <HI>every one</HI> may receive the things <HI>done in his body,</HI> according to that <HI>he hath done</HI> (not what any earthly repre&s;entative hath done for him) 2 Cor. 5. 10 And we freely confe&s;s that we can find no more warrant from divine truth, for any people on earth to con&s;titute any men their repre&s;entatives, to make laws, to impo&s;e religious taxes, than they have to appoint Peter or the Vir|gin Mary to repre&s;ent them before the throne a|bove. We are therefore brought to a &s;top about paying &s;o much regard to &s;uch laws, as to give in annual certificates to the other denomination, as we have formerly done.</P>
<P N="1">1. Becau&s;e the very nature of &s;uch a prac|tice implies an acknowledgment, that the civil power has a right to &s;et one religious &s;ect up a|bove another, el&s;e why need we give certificates

4. The &s;cheme we oppo&s;e evidently tends to de&s;troy the purity and life of religion; for the in&s;pired apo&s;tle a&s;&s;ures us, that the church is <HI>e&s;|pou&s;ed as a cha&s;te virgin to Chri&s;t,</HI> and is obliged to be <HI>&s;ubject to him in every thing,</HI> as a true wife is to her hu&s;band.

E&s;pecially if we con&s;ider that not only the purity, but al&s;o the very life and being of religion among us is concerned therein; for 'tis evident that Chri&s;t has given as plain laws to de|termine what the duty of people is to his mini&s;|ters, as he has the duty of mini&s;ters to his peo|ple;
<PB N="46" REF="012654_0045_0F8BBF96B6F36200">

The common plea of our opponents is, that people will not do their duty if rulers do not enforce it; but does not the whole book of God clearly &s;hew, that mini&s;ters as often fail of doing their duty as the people do? And where is the care of rulers to puni&s;h mini&s;ters for their unfaithfulne&s;s? They often talk about <HI>equality</HI> in the&s;e affairs, but where does it appear!

Yea, how can any rea&s;onably expect that HE who has the hearts of kings in his hand, will turn the heart of our earthly &s;overeign to hear the pleas for liberty, of tho&s;e who will not hear the cries of their fellow-&s;ubjects, under their oppre&s;&s;ions? Has it not

been plainly proved, that &s;o far as any man gra|tifies his own inclinations, without regard to the univer&s;al law of equity, &s;o far he is in bondage? &s;o that it is impo&s;&s;ible for any one to tyranize over others, without thereby becoming a mi&s;era|ble &s;lave him&s;elf: a &s;lave to raging lu&s;ts, and a &s;lave to guilty fears of what will be the con&s;e|quence. We are told that the father of Cyrus, tho' a heathen, <Q>Had often taught him to con|&s;ider, that the prudence of men is very &s;hort, and their views very limited; that they can|not penetrate into futurity; and that many times what they think mu&s;t needs turn to their advantage proves their ruin; whereas the Gods being eternal, know all things, future as well as pa&s;t, and in&s;pire tho&s;e that love them to undertake what is mo&s;t expedient for them; which is a favor and protection they owe to no man, and grant only to tho&s;e that invoke and con&s;ult them.</Q> And we are told by the &s;ame author,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Rollin in his ancient hi&s;tory</NOTE> of another wi&s;e heathen, who &s;aid, <Q>'Tis ob&s;ervable, that tho&s;e that fear the Deity mo&s;t, are lea&s;t afraid of man.</Q> And &s;hall not chri&s;tians awake to a mo&s;t hearty reverence of HIM who has &s;aid, (and will ever make good his word) <HI>With what mea&s;ure ye meet, it &s;hall be mea&s;ured to you again.</HI></P>
<P>Suffer us a little to expo&s;tulate with our fathers and brethren, who inhabit the land to which our ance&s;tors fled for religious liberty. You have lately been accu&s;ed with being di&s;orderly and rebellious, by men in power, who profe&s;s a
<PB N="54" REF="012654_0053_0F8BBFA1C84A21A0">
great regard for order and the public good; and why don't you believe them, and re&s;t ea&s;y under their admini&s;trations? You tell us you can|not, becau&s;e you are taxed where you are not repre&s;ented; and is it not really &s;o with us? You do not deny the right of the Briti&s;h parlia|ment to impo&s;e taxes within her own realm; on|ly complain that &s;he extends her taxing power beyond her proper limits; and have we not as good right to &s;ay you do the <HI>&s;ame thing?</HI> and &s;o that wherein you judge others you condemn your &s;elves? Can three thou&s;and miles po&s;&s;ibly fix &s;uch limits to taxing power, as the difference be|tween civil and &s;acred matters has already done? One is only a di&s;tance of <HI>&s;pace,</HI> the other is &s;o great a difference in the <HI>nature</HI> of things, as there is be|tween <HI>&s;acrifices to God,</HI> and the <HI>ordinances of men.</HI> This we tru&s;t has been fully proved.</P>
<P>If we a&s;k why have you not been ea&s;y and thankful &s;ince the parliament has taken off &s;o many of the taxes that they had laid upon us? you an&s;wer that they &s;till claim a power to tax us, when, and as much as they plea&s;e; and is not that the very difficulty before us? In the year 1747, our legi&s;lature pa&s;&s;ed an act to free the bapti&s;ts in general from mini&s;terial taxes for ten years: yet becau&s;e they increa&s;ed con&s;ider|ably, when that time was about half expired, they broke in upon the liberty they had granted, and made a new act, wherein no bapti&s;t church nor mini&s;ter was allowed to have any &s;uch exemption. till they had <HI>fir&s;t</HI> obtained certificates from three other churches. By which the late Mr. John Procter ob&s;erved (in a remon&s;trance that he
<PB N="55" REF="012654_0054_0F8BBFA291DB51D0">
drew, and which was pre&s;ented to our court) that they had as far as in them lay, <Q>disfran|chi&s;ed, unchurched and u&s;urped an illegal power over all the religious &s;ocieties of the people in &s;aid act called anabapti&s;ts through|out this province:&mdash;For where is it po&s;&s;ible for the poor anabapti&s;ts to find the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> three authenticated mini&s;ters and churches to au|thenticate the fir&s;t three!</Q> So we have now related a ca&s;e, in which a number of our breth|ren were put to new co&s;t for copies to notify o|thers, with hope of relief to them&s;elves, and yet in the &s;ame &s;e&s;&s;ion of court, they had a wor&s;e burden laid upon them than before; and their repeated cries, and then the petition of our uni|ted churches, were all rejected.</P>
<P>A very great greivance which our country has ju&s;tly complained of is, that by &s;ome late proceedings a man's hou&s;e or locks cannot &s;ecure either his per&s;on or his property, from oppre&s;&s;ive officers. Pray then con&s;ider what our brethren have &s;uffered at A&s;hfield.</P>
<P>Many think it hard to be frowned upon only for pleading for their rights, and laying open parti|cular acts of encroachment thereon; but what frowns have we met with for no other crime? and as the pre&s;ent conte&s;t between Great-Britain and America, is not &s;o much about the greatne&s;s of the taxes already laid, as about a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to their taxing power; &s;o (though what we have al|ready &s;uffered is far from being a trifle, yet) our greate&s;t difficulty at pre&s;ent concerns the &s;ubmit|ting
<PB N="56" REF="012654_0055_0F8BBFA34DA8A888">
to a taxing power in eccle&s;ia&s;tical affairs. It is &s;uppo&s;ed by many that we are exempted from &s;uch taxes, but they are greatly mi&s;taken, for all know that paper is a money article, and writing upon it is labour, and this tax we mu&s;t pay eve|ry year, as a token of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to their power, or el&s;e they will lay a heavier tax upon us. And we have one difficulty in &s;ubmitting to this pow|er, which our countrymen have not in the other ca&s;e: that is, our ca&s;e affects the con&s;cience, as their's does not: and equal liberty of con&s;cience is one e&s;&s;ential article in our CHARTER, which con&s;titutes this government, and de&s;cribes the extent of our rulers authority, and what are the rights and liberties of the people. And in the confe&s;&s;ion of faith which our rulers and their mi|ni&s;ters have publi&s;hed to the world, they &s;ay, <Q>God alone is Lord of the con&s;cience, and hath left it free from the doctrines and command|ments of men, which are, in <HI>any thing</HI> contra|ry to his word; or <HI>not contained in it;</HI> &s;o that to believe &s;uch doctrines, or to obey &s;uch commands, out of con&s;cience, is to <HI>betray</HI> true liberty of con&s;cience; and the requiring of an implicit faith, and an ab&s;olute blind obedience, is to de&s;troy liberty of con&s;cience and rea&s;on al&s;o.</Q></P>
<Q><P>And a mo&s;t famous hi&s;torian of their's, after mentioning &s;ome former violations of that liber|ty, &s;ays, The great noi&s;e that hath been made in the world about the <HI>per&s;ecution</HI> made in New-England, I will now &s;top with only tran&s;cribing the words uttered in the &s;ermon
<PB N="57" REF="012654_0056_0F8BBFA40315A088">
to the fir&s;t great and general a&s;&s;embly of the Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts-Bay, after the two colonies of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts and Plymouth were by Royal Charter united. (from 2 Chron. 12. 12.)</P>
<P>Things will <HI>go well,</HI> when magi&s;trates are great promoters of the thing that good is, and what the Lord requireth of them. I do not mean that it would be well for the <HI>civil</HI> magi&s;trate, with <HI>civil</HI> penalty to compel men to this or that <HI>way of wor&s;hip,</HI> which they are <HI>con&s;cientiou&s;ly</HI> indi&s;po&s;ed unto.

A man has a <HI>right</HI> unto his life, his e&s;tate, his liberty, and his family, although he &s;hould not come up unto the&s;e and tho&s;e ble&s;&s;ed <HI>in&s;titutions</HI> of our Lord.&mdash;<HI>Violences</HI> may bring the erroneous to be hypocrites, but they will never bring them to be believ|ers; no, they naturally prejudice men's minds again&s;t the <HI>cau&s;e,</HI> which is therein pretended for, as being a weak, a wrong, an evil cau&s;e.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Magnalia, B. 7. p. 28, 29.</NOTE></P></Q>
<P>The&s;e things were then delivered and were re|ceived with the <HI>thanks</HI> of the hou&s;e of repre&s;enta|tives, and ten years after were &s;pread by the hi&s;to|rian thro' the nation, with the expre&s;s de&s;ign of &s;toping any further complaints about New-Eng|land's per&s;ecutions. But if the con&s;titution of this government, gives the magi&s;trate no other

Can any better rea&s;on be rendered for this difference in conduct than this, viz. It has been found to be an ea&s;ier matter to <HI>impo&s;e</HI> upon people about their &s;ouls, than about their bodies or their temporal e&s;tates!</NOTE></P>
<P>In a celebrated oration for liberty, publi&s;hed la&s;t &s;pring in Bo&s;ton, a maxim was recited which carries it's own evidence with it, which is this, NO MAN CAN GIVE THAT WHICH IS ANOTHER'S. Yet have not our legi&s;lature from time to time, made acts to empower the major part of the in|habitants in towns and precincts, to <HI>give away</HI> their neighbours e&s;tates to what mini&s;ters they

plea&s;e! And can we &s;ubmit to &s;uch doctrines and commandments of men, and not <HI>betray</HI> true liberty of con&s;cience! Every per&s;on is or ought to be, benefited by civil government, and there|fore they owe rulers honor and a tribute on that account; but the like cannot be truly &s;aid of an impo&s;ed mini&s;ter; for as the go&s;pel mini&s;try is an ordinance of God and not of man, &s;o the obligation that any per&s;on or people are un|der to obey and &s;upport any man as a mini&s;ter of Chri&s;t, ari&s;es from the <HI>con&s;ideration</HI> of his ap|pearing to them to re&s;emble his Ma&s;ter in <HI>doctrine</HI> and <HI>conver&s;ation,</HI> and from the benefit which peo|ple receive under their mini&s;trations.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Heb. 12. 7, 17.

Heb. 13. 15, 16.</P>
<P>Thus we have laid before the public a brief view of our &s;entiments concerning liberty of con&s;cience, and a little &s;ketch of our &s;ufferings on that account. If any can &s;how us that we have made any mi&s;takes, either about principles or facts, we would lie open to conviction: But we hope none will violate the forecited article of faith &s;o much, as to require us to yield a <HI>blind obedience</HI> to them, or to expect that &s;poiling of
<PB N="60" REF="012654_0059_0F8BBFAAE342E2D0">
goods or impri&s;onment can move us to <HI>betray</HI> the cau&s;e of true liberty.</P>
<P>A late writer in the Bo&s;ton papers, has taken much pains to prove, that &s;ome other colonies have impo&s;ed upon people in &s;uch affairs wor&s;e than New-England has; and to prove it he informs us, that an act for mini&s;ters mainten|ance, was pa&s;&s;ed in New-York near eighty years ago, which &s;ucceeding rulers have turned to &s;up|port a denomination that had very few repre&s;en|tatives in court when the act was made, while the denomination who made it, have been deni|ed any benefit from it. If &s;o, how loud is the call to every man that is a friend to liberty, and who regards the good of po&s;terity, to ri&s;e and ex|ert all his influence, to demoli&s;h the engine which has done &s;o much mi&s;chief in all ages! We are far from trying to repre&s;ent the fathers of New-England as the wor&s;t of the coloni&s;ts; We be|lieve the contrary. But our veneration for their memory, is &s;o far from reconciling us to, that it fills us with greater dete&s;tation of, that <HI>my&s;tery of iniquity,</HI> which carried them into &s;uch acts of impo&s;ition and per&s;ecution as have left a great blemi&s;h upon their character. And &s;ince the&s;e are tedious things to dwell upon, we &s;hall clo&s;e with this remark.</P>
<P>The Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts mini&s;ters, in their letter to governor Jencks and other bapti&s;ts in Provi|dence, &s;aid, We hope and pray that ancient mat|ters that had <HI>acrimony</HI> unhappily in them may be buried in oblivion. Now we are told that
<PB N="61" REF="012654_0060_0F8BBFAD8B4C1AE8">
acrimony &s;ignifies that quality in one body whereby it corrodes, eats up or de&s;troys another, This <HI>eating de&s;troying</HI> quality is truly unhappy: but how can it be buried before it is dead? The wor&s;t of criminals are to be executed before they are buried. Therefore let this cruel <HI>man-eater</HI> be fairly executed, and we are ready to join heart and hand to bury him, and not to have a bone of him left for contention in all the land. If it be &s;o hard to our opponents to hear of the&s;e matters, what has it been to tho&s;e who have felt their eating and de&s;troying influence for the&s;e hund|red and forty years? And how can any per&s;on lift up his head before God or man, and &s;ay he hopes to have the&s;e things buried, if he at the &s;ame time holds fa&s;t, and tries hard to keep alive the procuring cau&s;e of them!</P>

<P>SINCE the above was written, I have receiv|ed direct accounts, that at Montague (who&s;e ca&s;e is mentioned p. 32.) they continue from time to time, to make di&s;tre&s;s upon the princi|pal members of the bapti&s;t church there, whom the law directs to &s;ign their certificates, while
<PB N="62" REF="012654_0061_0F8BBFAEA4DCCC50">
they let the re&s;t of the &s;ociety alone. Al&s;o that William White a regular member of the bapti&s;t church in A&s;hfield, who lives in Che&s;terfield, and has had his &s;tanding in &s;aid church certified ac|cording to law; yet had a cow taken from him on Augu&s;t 25, 1773, and &s;old the 30th, for the pedobapti&s;t mini&s;ters rate; and that in both of the&s;e places, the civil charges of the town, and the mini&s;ters &s;alary are all blended in one tax (contrary as I am informed to the law of our province) &s;o that our brethren who would readily pay their civil tax, yet cannot do it, without pay|ing the mini&s;ters al&s;o. Now the grand pretence that is made for the u&s;e of the &s;ecular arm to &s;upport mini&s;ters is, that thereby <HI>equality</HI> is e&s;|tabli&s;hed among the people; but what religion, equality or equity can there be in the above proceedings!</P>
