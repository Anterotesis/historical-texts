<HEAD>An ENQUIRY into the EFFECTS of SPIRITUOUS LIQUORS upon the HUMAN BODY, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>BY &s;pirits I mean all tho&s;e liquors which are obtained by di&s;tillation from the fermented juices or &s;ub&s;tances of any kind. The&s;e liquors were formerly u&s;ed only in medicine.&mdash;They now con&s;titute a principal part of the drinks of many countries.</P>
<P>Since the introduction of &s;pirituous liquors into &s;uch general u&s;e, phy&s;icians have remarked that a number of new di&s;ea&s;es have appeared among us, and have de&s;cribed many new &s;ymp|toms as common to old di&s;ea&s;es. Spirits in their fir&s;t operation are &s;timulating upon the &s;y&s;tem. They quicken the circulation of the blood, and produce &s;ome heat in the body. Soon after|wards, they become what is called &s;edative; that is, they di|mini&s;h the action of the vital powers, and thereby produce langour and weakne&s;s.</P>
<P>The effects of &s;pirituous liquors upon the human body in producing di&s;ea&s;es are &s;ometimes gradual. A &s;trong con&s;ti|tution, e&s;pecially if it be a&s;&s;i&s;ted with con&s;tant and hard la|bour, will counteract the de&s;tructive effects of &s;pirits for many years, but in general they produce the following di&s;ea&s;es:</P>
<P N="1">1. A &s;ickne&s;s at the &s;tomach, and vomiting in the morning. This di&s;order is generally accompanied with a want of appe|tite for breakfa&s;t. It is known by tremors in the hands, in&s;o|much that per&s;ons who labour under it are hardly able to lift a teacup to their heads 'till they have taken a do&s;e of &s;ome cor|dial liquor. In this di&s;order, a peculiar palene&s;s, with &s;mall red &s;treaks, appear in the cheeks. The fle&s;h of the face at the &s;ame time has a peculiar fulne&s;s and flabbine&s;s which are very different from &s;ound and healthy fat.</P>
<P N="2"><PB REF="022865_0005_0FBA9C6A1D3FD6B8">
2. An univer&s;al <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">. This di&s;order begins fir&s;t in the lower limbs, and gradually extends it&s;elf throughout the whole body. I have been told that the merchants in Charle&s;ton, in South-Carolina, never tru&s;t the planters when &s;pirits have pro|duced the fir&s;t &s;ymptom of this &s;econd di&s;order upon them. It is very natural to &s;uppo&s;e, that indu&s;try and virtue have become extinct in that man who&s;e legs and feet are &s;welled from the u&s;e of &s;pirituous liquors.</P>
<P N="3">3. Ob&s;truction of the liver. This di&s;order produces other di&s;ea&s;es &s;uch as an inflammation, which &s;ometimes proves &s;ud|denly fatal&mdash;the jaundice&mdash;and a drop&s;y of the belly.</P>
<P N="4">4. Madne&s;s. It is unnece&s;&s;ary to de&s;cribe this di&s;ea&s;e with all its terrors and con&s;equences. It is well known in every town&s;hip where &s;pirituous liquors are u&s;ed.</P>
<P N="5">5. The Pal&s;y and 6. the Apoplexy compleat the group of di&s;ea&s;es produced by &s;pirituous liquors. I do not a&s;&s;ert that the&s;e two di&s;orders are never produced by any other cau&s;es, but I maintain that &s;pirituous liquors are the mo&s;t frequent cau&s;es of them, and that when a predi&s;po&s;ition to them is produced by other cau&s;es, they are rendered more certain and more dan|gerous by the intemperate u&s;e of &s;pirits.</P>
<P>I have only named a few of the principal di&s;orders produced by &s;pirituous liquors. It would take up a volume to de&s;cribe how much other di&s;orders natural to the human body are en|crea&s;ed and complicated by them. Every &s;pecies of inflamma|tory and putrid fever is rendered more frequent and more ob|&s;tinate by the u&s;e of &s;pirituous liquors.</P>
<P>The danger to life from the di&s;ea&s;es which have been men|tioned is well known. I do not think it extravagant therefore to repeat here what has been often &s;aid, that &s;pirituous liquors de&s;troy more lives than the &s;word. War has its intervals of de&s;truction&mdash;but &s;pirits operate at all times and &s;ea&s;ons upon human life. The ravages of war are confined to but one part of the human &s;pecies, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> to men, but &s;pirits act too often upon per&s;ons who are exempted from the dangers of war by age or &s;ex; and la&s;tly, war de&s;troys only tho&s;e per&s;ons who allow the u&s;e of arms to be lawful, wheareas &s;pirits in&s;inuate their fatal effects among people who&s;e principles are oppo&s;ed to the effu&s;&s;ion of human blood.</P>
<P>Let us next turn our eyes from the effects of &s;pirits upon health and life to their effects upon <HI>property;</HI> and here fre&s;h &s;cenes of mi&s;ery open to our view. Among the inhabitants of cities, they produce debts&mdash;di&s;grace and bankruptcy. Among farmers they produce idlene&s;s with its u&s;ual con&s;equences, &s;uch as hou&s;es without windows&mdash;barns without roofs&mdash;gardens
<PB REF="022865_0006_0FBA9C6EC56E1B30">
without enclo&s;ures&mdash;fields without fences&mdash;hogs without yokes&mdash;&s;heep without wool&mdash;meagre cattle&mdash;feeble hor&s;es&mdash;and half clad dirty children without principles, morals or manners.&mdash;This picture is not exaggerated. I appeal to the ob&s;ervations of every man in Penn&s;ylvania, whether &s;uch &s;cenes of wretch|edne&s;s do not follow the tracks of &s;pirituous liquors in every part of the &s;tate.</P>
<P>If we advance one &s;tep further and examine the effects of &s;pirituous liquors upon the <HI>moral faculty,</HI> the pro&s;pect will be &s;till more di&s;tre&s;&s;ing and terrible. The fir&s;t effects of &s;pirits upon the mind &s;hew them&s;elves in the <HI>temper.</HI> I have con|&s;tantly ob&s;erved men who are intoxicated in any degree with &s;pirits to be peevi&s;h and quarrel&s;ome; after a while they lo&s;e by degrees the moral &s;en&s;e. They violate promi&s;es and en|gagements without &s;hame or remor&s;e. From the&s;e deficiences in veracity and integrity, they pa&s;s on to crimes of a more heinous nature.&mdash;It would be to di&s;honour human nature only to name them.</P>
<P>Thus have I in a few words pointed out the effects of &s;pi|rituous liquors upon the lives, e&s;tates and &s;ouls of my fellow-creatures.&mdash;Their mi&s;chiefs may be &s;ummed up in a few words. They fill our church yards with premature graves&mdash;they fill the Sheriff's docket with executions&mdash;they croud our jails&mdash;and la&s;tly they people the regions&mdash;but it belongs to another profe&s;&s;ion to &s;hew their terrible con&s;equences in the future world.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now proceed to combat &s;ome prejudices in favor of the u&s;e of &s;pirituous liquors.</P>
<P>There are <HI>three</HI> occa&s;ions in which &s;pirits have been thought to be nece&s;&s;ary and u&s;eful.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. In very cold weather.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. In very warm weather. And</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. In times of hard labour.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P N="1">1. There cannot be a greater error than to &s;uppo&s;e that &s;pi|rituous liquors le&s;&s;en the effects of cold upon the body. On the contrary, I maintain that they always render the body more liable to be affected and injured by cold. The tempo|rary warmth they produce is always &s;ucceeded by chilline&s;s. If any thing be&s;ides warm cloathing and exerci&s;e is nece&s;&s;ary to warm the body in cold weather, a plentiful meal of whole|&s;ome food is at all times &s;ufficient for that purpo&s;e. This by giving a tone to the &s;tomach invigorates the whole &s;y&s;tem, while the gentle fever created by dige&s;tion adds con&s;iderably to the natural and ordinary heat of the body, and thus renders it le&s;s &s;en&s;ible of the cold.</P>
<P N="2"><PB REF="022865_0007_0FBA9C7048164C18">
2. It is equally ab&s;urd to &s;uppo&s;e that &s;pirituous liquors le&s;&s;en the effects of heat upon the body. So far from it, they ra|ther encrea&s;e them. They add an internal heat to the external heat of the Sun; they di&s;po&s;e to fevers and inflammations of the mo&s;t dangerous kind; they produce preternatural &s;weats which weaken, in&s;tead of a uniform and gentle per&s;piration which exhilarates the body. Half the di&s;ea&s;es which are &s;aid to be produced by warm weather, I am per&s;uaded are produced by the &s;pirits which are &s;wallowed to le&s;&s;en its effects upon the &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P N="3">3. I maintain with equal confidence, that &s;pirituous liquors do not le&s;&s;en the effects of hard labour upon the body. Look at the hor&s;e&mdash;with every mu&s;cle of his body &s;welled from morn|ing 'till night in the plough or the team, does he make &s;igns for &s;pirits to enable him to cleave the earth, or to climb a hill?&mdash;No.&mdash;He requires nothing but cool water and &s;ub&s;tantial food. There is neither &s;trength nor nouri&s;hment in &s;pirituous liquors. If they produce vigour in labour, it is of a tran&s;ient nature, and is always &s;ucceeded with a &s;en&s;e of weakne&s;s and fatigue. The&s;e facts are founded in ob&s;ervation; for I have repeatedly &s;een tho&s;e men perform the greate&s;t exploits in work both as their degrees and duration, who never ta&s;ted &s;pirituous liquors.</P>
<P>But are there no conditions of the human body in which &s;pirituous liquors are required? Yes, there are; 1&s;t. In tho&s;e ca&s;es where the body has been exhau&s;ted by any cau&s;es, and faintine&s;s, or a &s;toppage in the circulation of the blood has been produced, the &s;udden &s;timulus of &s;pirits may be nece&s;&s;ary. In this ca&s;e we comply &s;trictly with the advice of Solomon, who confines the u&s;e of "&s;trong drink" only to him "that is ready to peri&s;h!" And 2dly. When the body has been long expo&s;ed to wet weather, and more e&s;pecially if cold be joined with it, a moderate quantity of &s;pirits is not only proper but highly u&s;eful to obviate debility, and thus to prevent a fever. I take the&s;e to be the only two ca&s;es that can occur in which &s;pirituous liquors are innocent or nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>But if we reject &s;pirits from being part of our drinks, what liquors &s;hall we &s;ub&s;titute in the room of them? For cu&s;tom&mdash;the experience of all ages and countries, and even nature her|&s;elf all &s;eem to demand drinks more grateful and more cordial than &s;imple water.</P>
<P>To this I &s;hall reply, by recommending in the room of &s;pirits in the fir&s;t place,</P>
<P N="1">1. CYDER. This excellent liquor contains a &s;mall quantity of &s;pirit, but &s;o diluted and blunted, by being combined with an
<PB REF="022865_0008_0FBA9C742791EDB8">
acid and a large quantity of &s;acharine matter and water, as to be perfectly inoffen&s;ive and whole&s;ome. It di&s;agrees only with per&s;ons &s;ubject to the rheumati&s;m, but it may be rendered inoffen&s;ive to &s;uch people by extingui&s;hing a red hot iron in it, or by diluting it with water. It is to be lamented that the late fro&s;ts in the &s;pring often deprive us of the fruit which affords this liquor. But the effects of the&s;e fro&s;ts have been in &s;ome mea&s;ure obviated by giving an orchard a north-we&s;t expo&s;ure, &s;o as to check too early vegetation, and by kindling two or three large fires of bru&s;h and &s;traw to windward of the orchard the evening before we expect a night of fro&s;t. This la&s;t expedient has in many in&s;tances within the com|pa&s;s of my knowledge, pre&s;erved the fruit of an orchard, to the great joy, and emolument of the ingenious hu&s;bandman.</P>
<P N="2">2. BEER is a whole&s;ome liquor compared with &s;pirits. The grain from which it is obtained is not liable, like the apple, to be affected with fro&s;t, and therefore it can always be pro|cured at a moderate expence. It abounds with nouri&s;hment&mdash;hence we find many of the common people in Great-Britain endure hard labour with no other food than a quart or three pints of this liquor, with a few pounds of bread a day. I have heard with great plea&s;ure of breweries being &s;et up in &s;everal of the principal county towns of Pen&s;ylvania, and I e&s;teem it a &s;ign of the progre&s;s of our &s;tate in wealth and happine&s;s, that a &s;ingle brewer in Che&s;ter county &s;old above 1000 barrels of beer la&s;t year. While I wi&s;h to &s;ee a law impo&s;ing the beavie&s;t taxes on whi&s;ky di&s;tilleries, I &s;hould be glad to &s;ee breweries (at lea&s;t for &s;ome years) wholly exempted from taxation.</P>
<P N="3">3. WINE is likewi&s;e a whole&s;ome liquor compared with &s;pirits. The low wines of France I believe could be drank at a le&s;s expence than &s;pirits in this country. The pea&s;ants in France who drink the&s;e liquors in large quantities, are a heal|thy and &s;ober body of people. Wines of all kinds yield by chemical analy&s;is the &s;ame principles as cyder, but in differ|ent proportions, hence they are both cordial and nouri&s;hing. It is remarked that few men ever become <HI>habitual</HI> drunkards upon wine. It derives its reli&s;h principally from company, and is &s;eldom like &s;pirituous liquors drank in a chimney cor|ner or in a clo&s;et. The effects of wine upon the <HI>temper</HI> are likewi&s;e in mo&s;t ca&s;es directly oppo&s;ite to tho&s;e that were mentioned of &s;pirituous liquors. It mu&s;t be a bad heart in|deed that is not rendered more chearful and more generous by a few gla&s;&s;es of wine.</P>
<P N="4"><PB REF="022865_0009_0FBA9C7551B64570">
4. VINEGAR and WATER &s;weetened with &s;ugar or mo|la&s;&s;es, is the be&s;t drink that can be contrived in warm weather. I beg leave to recommend this whole&s;ome mixture to reapers in a particular <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">. It is plea&s;ant and cooling. It promotes per&s;piration, and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> putrefaction. Vinegar and water con&s;tituted the only drink of the &s;oldiers of the Roman repub|lic, and it is well known that they marched, and fought in a warm climate, and beneath a load of arms that weighed &s;ixty pounds. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">, a wealthy farmer in Pale&s;tine, we find treated his reapers with nothing but bread dipped in vinegar. Say not that&mdash;&s;pirits have become nece&s;&s;ary in harve&s;t from habit and the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> of the country. The cu&s;tom of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> this liquid fire is a bad one, and the habit of it may be broken. Let half a dozen farmers in a neighbourhood combine to al|low higher wages to their reapers than are common, and a &s;uf|ficient quantity of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> of the liquors I have recommended, and they may &s;oon aboli&s;h the practice of giving them &s;pirits. They will in a little while be delighted with the good effects of their a&s;&s;ociation. Their grain will be &s;ooner and more carefully gathered into their barns, and an hundred di&s;agreea|ble &s;cenes of &s;ickne&s;s and contention will be avoided, which always follow in a greater or le&s;s degree the u&s;e of &s;pirituous liquors. Under this head, I &s;hould not neglect to recommend butter-milk and water, or &s;our milk, (commonly called bonne|clabber) and water. It will be rendered more grateful by the addition of a little &s;ugar. PUNCH is likewi&s;e calculated to le&s;&s;en the effects of heat, and hard labour upon the body. The &s;pirit in this liquor is blunted by its union with the vegetable acid. Hence it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es not only the con&s;tituent parts, but mo&s;t of the qualities of cyder, and wine. To render this li|quor perfectly innocent and whole&s;ome, it mu&s;t be drank <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">&mdash;in <HI>moderate</HI> quantities&mdash;and <HI>only</HI> in warm weather.</P>
<P>There are certain cla&s;&s;es of people to whom I beg leave to &s;ugge&s;t a caution or two upon the u&s;e of &s;pirituous liquors.</P>
<P N="1">1. Valitudinarians, e&s;pecially tho&s;e who labour under di&s;|orders of the &s;tomach and bowels, are very apt to fly to &s;pi|rits for relief. Let &s;uch people be cautious how they repeat this dangerous remedy. I have known many men and wo|men, of excellent characters and principles, who have been betrayed by occa&s;ional do&s;es of gin or brandy to ea&s;e the cho|lic, into a love of &s;pirituous liquors, in&s;omuch that they have afterwards fallen &s;acrifices to their fatal effects. The different preparations of opium are a thou&s;and times more &s;afe and in|nocent than &s;pirituous liquors in all &s;pasmodic affections of the &s;tomach and bowels. So apprehen&s;ive am i of the danger of
<PB REF="022865_0010_0FBA9C770E520018">
contracting <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> &s;pirituous liquors, by accu&s;toming the &s;tomach. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span">, that I think the fewer medicines we exhibit <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> the better.</P>
<P N="2">2. Some people from living in countries &s;ubject to the in|termitting fever, endeavour to fortify them&s;elves again&s;t it by two or three gla&s;&s;es of bitters made with &s;pirits every day.&mdash;There is great danger of men becoming <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> from this practice. Be&s;ides, this mode of preventing intermittents is by no means a certain one. A much better &s;ecurity again&s;t them is to be found in the Je&s;uits bark. A tea-&s;poonful of this excellent me|dicine, taken every morning during the &s;ickly &s;ea&s;on, has in many in&s;tances preferred whole families in the neighbourhood of rivers and mill-ponds from fevers of all kinds. Tho&s;e who live in a &s;ickly part of the country, and who cannot procure the bark, or who object to taking it, I would advi&s;e to avoid the morning and evening air in the &s;ickly months&mdash;to kindle fires in their hou&s;es on damp days, and in cool evenings throughout the whole &s;ummer, and to put on woollen cloathing about the fir&s;t week in September. The la&s;t part of this direction ap|plies only to the inhabitants of the middle &s;tates. The&s;e cau|tions I am per&s;uaded will be more effectual in preventing au|tumnal fevers than the be&s;t preparations that can be made from bitters in &s;pirits.</P>
<P N="3">3. Men who follow profe&s;&s;ions that require a con&s;tant exer|ci&s;e of the mind or body, or perhaps of both, are very apt to &s;eek relief from fatigue in &s;pirituous liquors. To &s;uch per&s;ons I would beg leave to recommend the u&s;e of TEA in&s;tead of &s;pi|rits. Fatigue is occa&s;ioned by the ob&s;truction of per&s;piration. Tea, by removing per&s;piration, removes fatigue, and thus in|vigorates the &s;y&s;tem. I am no advocate for the general or exce&s;&s;ive u&s;e of tea.&mdash;When drank too &s;trong it is hurtful, e&s;|pecially to the female con&s;titution; but when drank of a mo|derate degree of &s;trength, and in moderate quantities with &s;u|gar and cream or milk, I believe it is in general innocent, and at all times to be preferred to &s;pirituous liquors. One of the mo&s;t indu&s;trious &s;choolma&s;ter. I ever knew, told me that he had been pre&s;erved from the love of &s;pirituous liquors by con|tracting a love for tea in early life. Three or four di&s;hes drank in an afternoon, carried off the fatigue of a whole day's labour in his &s;chool. This gentleman lived to be 71 years of age, and afterwards died of an acute di&s;ea&s;e in the full exer|ci&s;e of all the faculties of his mind.</P>
<P>To every cla&s;s of my readers, I beg leave to &s;ugge&s;t a cau|tion again&s;t the u&s;e of TODDY. I acknowledge that I have known &s;ome men who by limiting its &s;trength con&s;tantly by
<PB REF="022865_0011_0FBA9C7AAFBF5BB0">
mea&s;uring the &s;pirit and water, and who by drinking it <HI>only</HI> with their <HI>meals,</HI> have drank toddy for many years without &s;uffering in any degree from it; but I have known many more who have been in&s;en&s;ibly led from drinking toddy for their con&s;tant drink, to take drams in the morning, and have afterwards paid their lives as the price of their folly. I &s;hall &s;elect one ca&s;e from among many that have come within the compa&s;s of my knowledge, to &s;hew the ordinary progre&s;s of intemprance in the u&s;e of &s;pirituous liquors. A gentleman, once of a fair and &s;ober character, in the city of Philadelphia, for many years drank toddy as his con&s;tant drink. From this he proceeded to drink grog&mdash;after a while nothing would &s;atis|fy him but &s;lings made of equal parts of rum and water, with a little &s;ugar. From &s;lings he advanced to raw rum&mdash;and and from common rum to Jamaica &s;pirits. Here he re&s;ted for a few months; but at la&s;t he found even Jamaica &s;pirits were not &s;trong enough to warm his &s;tomach, and he made it a con|&s;tant practice to throw a table-&s;poonful of ground pepper into each gla&s;s of his &s;pirits, in order (to u&s;e his own expre&s;&s;ions) "to take off their coldne&s;s;" it is hardly nece&s;&s;ary to add, that he &s;oon afterwards died a martyr to his intemperance.</P>
<P>I &s;hall conclude what has been &s;aid of the effects of &s;piri|tuous liquors with two ob&s;ervations.&mdash;1. A people corrupt|ed by &s;trong drink cannot long be a <HI>free</HI> people. The rulers of &s;uch a community will &s;oon partake of the vices of that ma&s;s from which they are &s;ecreted, and all our laws and go|vernments will &s;ooner or later bear the &s;ame marks of the effects of &s;pirituous liquors which were de&s;cribed formerly up|on inviduals. I &s;ubmit it therefore to the con&s;ideration of the Legi&s;lature of Penn&s;ylvania, whether more laws &s;hould not be made to encrea&s;e the expence and le&s;&s;en the con&s;ump|tion of &s;pirituous liquors, and whether &s;ome mark of public infamy &s;hould not be inflicted by law upon every man con|victed before a common magi&s;trate of drunkenne&s;s.</P>
<P>The &s;econd and la&s;t ob&s;ervation I &s;hall offer is of a &s;erious nature. It has been remarked that the Indians have dimini&s;h|ed every where in America &s;ince their connection with the Euro|peans. This has been ju&s;tly a&s;cribed to the Europeans having introduced &s;pirituous liquors among them. Let tho&s;e men who are every day turning their backs upon all the benefits of cultivated &s;ociety, to &s;eek habitations in the neighbourhood of Indians, con&s;ider how far this wandering mode of life is pro|duced by the &s;ame cau&s;e which has &s;cattered and annihilated &s;o many Indian tribes.&mdash;Long life, and the &s;ecure po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of property, in the land of their ance&s;tors, was looked upon

as a ble&s;&s;ing among the ancient Jews.&mdash;For a &s;on to mingle his du&s;t with the du&s;t of his father, was to act wor|thy of his inheritance; and the pro&s;pect of this honour often afforded a con&s;olation even in death.&mdash;However exalted my countrymen, your ideas of liberty may be, while you ex|po&s;e your&s;elves by the u&s;e of &s;pirituous liquors to this con|&s;equence, of them, you are nothing more than the pioneers, or in more &s;lavi&s;h terms, the, "hewers of wood" of your more indu&s;trious neighbours.</P>
<P>If the facts that have been &s;tated, have produced in any of my readers who have &s;uffered from the u&s;e of &s;pirituous li|quors a re&s;olution to ab&s;tain from them hereafter, I mu&s;t beg leave to inform them that they mu&s;t leave them off <HI>&s;uddenly</HI> and <HI>entirely.</HI> No man was ever <HI>gradually</HI> reformed from drinking &s;pirits. He mu&s;t not only avoid ta&s;ting, but even &s;melling them, until long habits of ab&s;tinence have &s;ubdued his affec|tion for them. To prevent his feeling any inconveniences from the &s;udden lo&s;s of their &s;timulus upon his &s;tomach, he &s;hould drink plentifully of camomile or of any other bitter tea, or a few gla&s;&s;es of &s;ound old wine every day. I have great plea&s;ure in adding, that I have &s;een a number of peo|ple who have been <HI>effectually</HI> re&s;tored to health&mdash;to cha|racter &mdash;and to u&s;efulne&s;s to their families and to &s;ociety by following this advice.</P>
