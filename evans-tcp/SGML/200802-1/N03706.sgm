<SALUTE>My very good Friends and Neighbours,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHEN, by you made Choice of to go down to <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> and examine into the publick Ju&s;tice and Advantage of a Scheme called the Land or Manufactury Bank, as well for your Con|duct, as that of my own in that Affair, you are &s;en&s;ible I declin'd that Tru&s;t as unequal to it; however when you ob&s;erv'd to me the Difficulty of procuring a Corre&s;pondent at <HI>Bo&s;ton</HI> free from Prejudice and Affection, and no way influ|enc'd by private Intere&s;t, to make a fair and ju&s;t Repre&s;en|tation of this Projection, I engaged in your Service with a full Re&s;olution diligently and impartially to &s;can the &s;ame; and which I &s;olemnly declare I have done to the utmo&s;t of my Capacity, a&s;&s;i&s;ted with all the Knowledge I could get by the clo&s;e&s;t Application</P>
<P>When I got to <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> I judged it mo&s;t prudent to intro|duce my&s;elf into variety of Company, and &s;trictly to take No<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ice how they handled this new Di&s;covery of a Medium. I could not be at a Lo&s;s in bringing it on the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">rpe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, for it was the general Topick of Conver&s;ation. Then I perceiv|ed
<PB N="3" REF="004541_0003_100D6503A387C788">
your Ob&s;ervation to be ju&s;t; for in all my Conver&s;ation I plainly di&s;covered it was treated by Per&s;ons according to their re&s;pective Affections, Prejudices, and Intere&s;ts; the mo&s;t noi&s;y on both Sides, mo&s;t ignorant of the intrin&s;ick Worth of it, and Strangers to the right Notion of a Medi|um or Currency in a Community. Others there were who appeared to me to be more intelligent and cool; undertak|ing to point out Objections to &s;everal material Parts of its Con&s;titution, and to the Mode of its Regulation: I mu&s;t take Notice I could never hear this Cla&s;s of Gentlemen o|pen in the Hearing of any of its Advocates, and therefore once took the Liberty of asking if they had at any Time attended the Committee according to their Adverti&s;ements, and had there rai&s;ed &s;uch their Objections? They replied, they had not, with &s;uch an Air as convinced me they judged they were unan&s;werable, or at lea&s;t, &s;o by the Gen|tlemen of the Committee, who&s;e Abilities and Sub&s;tance, they had not much in E&s;teem. I therefore thought this Method alone could not po&s;&s;ibly &s;ettle in me an equal and impartial State of the Affair, &s;o as to form a &s;atisfactory Judgment. However I carefully minuted down all the Objections worthy of Notice, and by whom made, that I might know whether private Intere&s;t was not in &s;ome Mea|&s;ure at the Bottom; and the&s;e Objectors turn'd out to be principal Merchants, Factors, and rich U&s;urers; but not|with&s;tanding I was re&s;olved to weigh the Objections them|&s;elves, and give them their ju&s;t Con&s;ideration, and that the Riches of tho&s;e Gentlemen might not give them any additi|onal Weight, I oppo&s;ed thereto their private Intere&s;ts, which may engage them on that Side.</P>
<P>My next Pur&s;uit of Light in a Ca&s;e of &s;o great Con&s;e|quence and &s;o differently repre&s;ented, was to hear how the Gentlemen of the Committee maintain'd the publick Ju&s;tice and Advantage of this their Scheme; and accord|ingly I waited on them, and tho' a Stranger, their Adver|ti&s;ement I ob&s;erved, was my Introduction, and opened to them the End of my Attendance. They expre&s;&s;ed them|&s;elves ready to afford me all the Light and Satisfaction they could, and wi&s;hed for the Peace and Harmony of the Com|munity

If &s;uch as decryed the Scheme had acted the like ingenious Part, it probably might have prevented many of the Invectives again&s;t it. As I was then the only Inquirer pre&s;ent to be &s;atisfied, they judged it mo&s;t fair that one of them only &s;hould maintain the publick Ju&s;tice and Advantage of the Projection; the Gentleman <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">o a&s;|&s;ign'd premi&s;ed &s;omething by Way of Introduction.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, That &s;ome Medium or Currency of Acceptance mu&s;t be &s;u&s;i&s;ting in all Communities, which being a Prin|cipal not to be brought into Que&s;tion, he proceeded.</P>
<P>Secondly, To demon&s;trate the Want of it in this Pro|vince, from the&s;e Particulars; <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> That all the Bills of Credit of this Province, that by Law ought now to be out|&s;tanding, equally divided would not amount to <HI>Five Shil|lings</HI> a Head, and as the greate&s;t Part of them were hoard|ed up by rich Men, there are not in Circulation what would amount to <HI>Six Pence</HI> a Head. So that in Fact this Province is at pre&s;ent dependant on the neighbouring Go|vernments for much the greate&s;t Part of &s;uch Bills of pub|lick Credit as are in Currency among us And <HI>Secondly</HI> that all fall greatly &s;hort of the pre&s;ent Exigency plainly ap|pears, from a pernicious Practice and cheating Method of &s;ub&s;tituting Drafts on Shops in the Place of a Medium, to pay Artificers and poor Labourers. Herein the Gentle|man mentioned a few &s;hocking In&s;tances, which for brevity I &s;hall not mention. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> The want of this Medium is further evidenced from the Nece&s;&s;ity we were drove to, in being obliged to catch at <HI>Rhode I&s;land</HI> la&s;t Em&s;&s;ion, and that in open Defiance of a &s;tanding Law of this Province, and now glibly received by all our Merchants, notwith|&s;tanding their mo&s;t &s;olemn Declarations to the contrary; and <HI>La&s;tly,</HI> to &s;hew what Nece&s;&s;ity will drive Men to, he declared that he had it credibly reported, that the Coun|terfeited <HI>Five Pound</HI> Bills pa&s;s at the Ea&s;tward as currant as the true Bills, tho' known to be Counterfeits.</P>
<P>The Gentleman, Thirdly, after thus proving the want of a Medium, proceeded to ob&s;erve the &s;ame can't be obtain|ed from the Legi&s;lature, during the continuation of His Maje&s;ty's In&s;tructions to his Governour&punc; and for that re|ferred

him&s;elf to the Proceeding of the la&s;t General Court. And finally the&s;e were the Motives that animated the Com|mittee (to u&s;e his own Words) to enterprize a De&s;ign of &s;o grand Importance, the U&s;efulne&s;s and Ju&s;tice of which, was now the Subject Matter of my Inquiry. The Projection &s;aid he, is term'd the Land Bank, from the Foundation of it on real E&s;tates, the mo&s;t permanent Security that can be given, and al&s;o called the Manufactury Bank, from its Production, and that it's real Security at Bottom is &s;uperior to that of any other Paper Emi&s;&s;ion, is obvious; for the Sub&s;criber's E&s;tate to be Mortgaged is to be apprized by skilful Per&s;ons under Oath to be equal and one half more in Value than the Sub&s;cription Money amounts to. The Sub&s;cribers are to pay annually, Intere&s;t at the Rate of three per Cent. and one twentieth Part of the Principal, which annually renders the Security better; whereas in all other Emi&s;&s;ions of Paper Bills upon Land Security, its true, they were apprized by Per&s;ons under Oath, and too often by Neighbours playing into one another's Hands, were over valued, the Mortgagors keeping in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion for many Years, without paying Principal or Intere&s;t, cutting the Wood, and wearing out the Land, at la&s;t left the Province a &s;lender Security indeed. Be&s;ides here every Sub&s;criber in Ca&s;e of any Jealou&s;y that the Security given is &s;canty, is enjoined by the Con&s;titution, to give fre&s;h or additional Se|curity, which is &s;uch a &s;trengthning, as is wanting in all other Paper Emi&s;&s;ions; &s;o that he a&s;&s;erted, no Bank in Europe, no Emi&s;&s;ion of Paper Currency in <HI>America,</HI> is or can be e&s;tabli&s;hed upon a better or more unexceptionable a Foundation&punc; He further added, that be&s;ides the View the Committee had in corroborating the Security annually, by obliging a twentieth Part of the Principal to be &s;o paid, it al&s;o forced the Sub&s;criber yearly to be indu&s;trious, and he had it not in his Power to po&s;tpone the evil Day; which has been too frequently the Ca&s;e between the Publick and Borrower i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> former Paper Emi&s;&s;ions, to the Injury of the one, and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Ruin of the other.</P>
<P>As to its Production, from whence it is &s;ometimes called the Manufact<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ry Bank; its true, it is not calculated to
<PB N="6" REF="004541_0006_100D650A37F8FAC0">
render Silver or Gold an immediate Medium among us, the Bills them&s;elves being emitted on unque&s;tionable Secu|rity, mu&s;t therefore carry with them indi&s;putable Credit, and con&s;equently be a con&s;tant Medium, ever circulating, and as paid in, placed out again on lawful Intere&s;t; for if all is to be called in at a certain Period of Time, then the Medium is lo&s;t. All Payments are to be made to the Company in their Bills, or in the enumerated Manufactures <HI>ad Valorem,</HI> according to the Denomination of the Bill. And as <HI>One Hundred and Fifty Thou&s;and Pounds</HI> in the&s;e Bills will in the Run of twenty Years, &s;till be but <HI>One Hundred and Fifty Thou&s;and Pounds</HI> in Bills, then it follows, the Intere&s;t of them multiplied all the Time, mu&s;t be paid in the enu|merated Manufactures, which of Nece&s;&s;ity mu&s;t greatly promote Indu&s;try, &s;ink Import, and rai&s;e Export; and cer|tainly, when Import and Export with us are upon a Par, Silver and Gold will then &s;tay with us, mix with the Ma|nufactury Bills, and become a joint Medium among us; But at this Time a Day, when the Glut of Engli&s;h Goods, like Weeds choke our growing Manufactures, and our Im|port from thence &s;o va&s;tly exceeds our Export, to pretend to make Silver or Gold a Medium in Circulation among us, or by the be&s;t concerted Schemes to render it &s;o, mu&s;t &s;ur|pa&s;s the Reach of all Mankind, &s;aving a very few, who give them&s;elves the addition of Merchants, who&s;e Riches he &s;aid when he beheld, he was &s;urprized at their Under|&s;ta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ding, and when he &s;urveyed their Under&s;tanding, was equally &s;urprized at their Riches; and therefore to &s;upplant a wild Scheme, called a Silver Bank guilded with an a&s;&s;u|rance of introducing Silver and Gold among us, under our pre&s;ent Circum&s;tances, but virtually calculated to take away the addition of Yeoman in the Country, and impo&s;e on them the additions of H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">sbandmen, Labourers and Tenants, greatly contributed to the forming this Land and Manu|factury Bank.</P>
<P>He urged further that this Sett of Gentlemen were not content them&s;elves to expre&s;s &s;evere Things of the Committee, but had inli&s;ted a Writer, to treat them in Print with more Indecency. But that unguarded Gentleman happened to
<PB N="7" REF="004541_0007_100D650C6A64BCC8">
over-act his Part, by publi&s;hing a Pamphlet, whereby he pre&s;cribed PURGING the Province of all Paper Currency, and dances the Reader over the &s;everal States in <HI>Europe,</HI> and in all &s;hewing by Experience the pernicious Tendency of Paper Currency; but as that Gentleman has been &s;ufficiently handled by a Gentleman of much more Knowledge in that Subject and Manners, he &s;hould not &s;ay any Thing further, than ob&s;erve in reading his Treati&s;e, I &s;hould find upon the lea&s;t Reflection, that tho&s;e States were free and ab&s;olute Powers, made &s;uch Emi&s;&s;ions on Exigencies, and &s;ome of them with unju&s;t Views; and as often as they came ju&s;tly to them&s;elves, they had ab&s;olute Power to redre&s;s tho&s;e Grievances; whereas this Province, is a dependant Planta|tion, on their Mother Country, can't make &s;umptuary Laws, or &s;uch as may extricate them out of their pre&s;ent Diffi|culties, nor u&s;e Spunges to wipe away old Debts. And further remarked that the Author in drawing out of the Province, all this <HI>corrupted Blood,</HI> meaning Paper Currency, does not inject better in the room. It's ea&s;y to &s;ay Silver and Gold will be the Medium, but he does not inform the Publick how to effect it.</P>
<P>He finally ob&s;erved to me, that however the Author pro|fe&s;&s;ed him&s;elf in his Writing to have the real Intere&s;t of this Province at Heart, he had al&s;o at the &s;ame Time a little of his own, for he had &s;everal Mortgages &amp; Bonds to be paid in Silver, or Province Bills, and if no Province Bills remain, then he receives Silver for a Loan perhaps of <HI>Rhode I&s;land, New-Hamp&s;hire,</HI> and <HI>Connecticut</HI> Bills of Credit.</P>
<P>The Gentleman having fini&s;hed what he had to &s;ay on that Head, proceeded to &s;hew a further In&s;tance of publick U&s;e and Ju&s;tice that mu&s;t re&s;ult from the afore&s;aid Pro|jection, which was to &s;creen the indu&s;trious who wanted a Medium to go to Work, from being eat up by the griping U&s;urer: and what exorbitant Intere&s;t is daily taken; the Gentleman was plea&s;ed to mention &s;everal In&s;tances; and al&s;o one of a new Cut, where a very con&s;iderable Merchant in <HI>Bo&s;ton,</HI> upon the Emi&s;&s;ions of Merchants Notes (&s;o called) <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ent a Gentleman a Sum in Paper Currency of the &s;everal Governments, and had the Borrower's E&s;tate mortgaged to
<PB N="8" REF="004541_0008_100D650E9C09B048">
him, redeemable upon paying the like Sum in Merchants Notes, or Silver at <HI>nineteen Shillings</HI> per Ounce: and withal &s;aid, there might be enumerated &s;everal &s;uch devouring In|&s;tances; whereas the ninth Article of the Manufactury Scheme, will be annually rooting out this pernicious Weed, till the Publick will be effectually cleared of it.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, the Gentleman took Notice, the De&s;ign of the Committee was laudable, and not ba&s;e, as by &s;ome branded. And as he had accounted for the publick Ju&s;tice and U&s;efulne&s;s of the De&s;ign he would not entertain me with a Vindication of the Regulations pre&s;cribed for the e&s;tabli&s;hing and governing of the Company mo&s;t of them being &s;uch as are in the Frame of other Companys, there|fore would patiently wait to hear and an&s;wer &s;uch Objecti|ons as I &s;hould rai&s;e, either again&s;t the e&s;&s;ential or material Parts of the Projection, or the Rules pre&s;cribed for the Go|vernment thereof. I thanked the Cammittee for their can|did and ingenious Treatment, and ob&s;erved in Ju&s;tice to my Principals, and to the Weight of the De&s;ign, I mu&s;t take a rea&s;onable Time to con&s;ider and dige&s;t what I had heard, which may give ri&s;e to Objections that now do not occur, and accordingly took my Leave of them, with an A&s;&s;u|rance of attending them once more before I wrote to my Employers.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t acknowlege I was plea&s;ed with this Interview, and the Gentleman's Addre&s;s and Rea&s;oning &s;eemed to gain prodigiou&s;ly on me, but &s;till jealous of Impo&s;ition, I tho't it advi&s;eable to re&s;ort back to my Minutes o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> Objections, I had before taken, con&s;ider them, and &s;uch others as may appear to me proper, with what I had heard from the Com|mittee; and after a few Days devoted for this &s;pecial Pur|po&s;e, and having methodized all the material Objections, I waited again on the Committee, who were plea&s;ed to a&s;&s;ign another of them to hear and an&s;wer me</P>
<P>And fir&s;t, I ob&s;erv'd, in my Opinion the Scheme oug<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> to comprehend in their enumerated Commodities, Por<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> and Grain, Oil and Whalebone.</P>
<P>To this the Gentleman candidly acknowledged Oil and Whalebone e&s;caped them; Pork and Grain the Committee
<PB N="9" REF="004541_0009_100D6510CA2273B0">
thought of, but being peri&s;hable and wa&s;ting Commodities, they thought proper not to enumerate them; however, if agreeable to the Publick the Enumeration &s;hall take them in; for to be &s;ure they will con&s;iderably contribute to the Credit and Circulation of the Company's Bills.</P>
<P>A further Objection I made, that the&s;e Bills will not gain a Currency, e&s;pecially when oppo&s;ed by almo&s;t all the tra|ding Part of the Province, and the Gentlemen of the Com|mittee without any Reflection, can't by their Scituation in Life afford any additional Weight to them, and the gene|rality of the Sub&s;cribers are Per&s;ons that carry on little other Bu&s;ine&s;s than that of Husbandry, and con&s;equently incapa|citated to force a Currency of them.</P>
<P>To which the Gentleman an&s;wered, that there were &s;ome Traders and Per&s;ons that carry on a con&s;iderable Stroke of Bu&s;ine&s;s, that had already &s;ub&s;cribed, and in Ca&s;e the Great and General Court &s;hould decline any Interpo&s;ition, a great Number of &s;uch will &s;ub&s;cribe; neither are the Sub&s;cribers &s;o in&s;ignificant and impotent as a Set of Gentlemen would repre&s;ent them. It's &s;uppo&s;ed there will be about One Thou&s;and Sub&s;cribers, who in their Station of Life mu&s;t have an Intercour&s;e of Bu&s;ine&s;s or Dealing interwoven with Ten Thou&s;and more; and &s;uch a Society of Men in the intercour&s;e of their Bu&s;ine&s;s, will of nece&s;&s;ity give Bills e|mitted, on Security &s;uperiour to that of all others, a Circu|lation; and &s;uch have already &s;ub&s;cribed &amp; will &s;ub&s;cribe, who are by their Scituation and Mode of Living, better qualified to give the&s;e Manufactury Bills Credit, than even tho&s;e Merchants, who pretend not to receive them; for the Province would perhaps &s;ub&s;i&s;t as well, if not better, if all tho&s;e Merchants de&s;erted it, and the Towns &s;ent the Production of their Indu&s;try to foreign Markets them&s;elves. <HI>Marblehead</HI> has herein &s;hewn an Example worthy an Imi|tation, and a few more &s;uch free &s;pirited Towns, will humble tho&s;e Gentlemen who vainly think there can't be a Medium without their particular Fiat. Be&s;ides, the enumerated Commodities as brought into the Trea&s;ury, being to be Sold for the Company Bills, and no other Payments to be received, and &s;uch Bills as are daily paid into the Trea&s;ury,
<PB N="10" REF="004541_0010_100D651284BEFF10">
being again let out at 6 per Cent to &s;uch as are not of the Company, mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity &s;till promote the Circulation.</P>
<P>He further added, that if I would inquire how and by whom <HI>Rhode I&s;land</HI> la&s;t Emi&s;&s;ion, in defiance of this Government, and maugre all the&s;e Merchants could do, gain'd a Currency; and what Trumpery now pa&s;&s;es at the Ea&s;tward; and then judge, whether the&s;e Bills &s;o well founded and productive of &s;uch Manufactures, at this Time can po&s;&s;ibly fail of Credit; and why the&s;e Merchants &s;hould refu&s;e receiving the&s;e Bills, is &s;urprizing. Is not the Bottom of the one much better than the other? Is not the certainty of the Payment of one, to the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or &s;urer than the other? Who knows what that Government may do, when pre&s;&s;ed, either by protracting Payment <HI>ad infinitum,</HI> or making an Act like a Spunge to wipe them all away? Surely the&s;e prote&s;ting Merchants mu&s;t have in View that the People of this Province, of nece&s;&s;ity mu&s;t re&s;ort to neigh|bouring Colonies for a Medium, which is to the great Scandal and Ruin of the Province, or embrace Schemes by them projected, not for the good of the People, but of them&s;elves and their Employers at Home; and is no more than what might be fairly collected from their own Words. And he affirmed in Ca&s;e of an Emi&s;&s;ion, the&s;e Merchants who are always governed by their Intere&s;t, will gladly take them. For it's notoriou&s;ly known there are for the gene|rality, as few Bills of any Emi&s;&s;ion, in their Compting-Hou&s;es, as in the Hou&s;es of &s;everal of the Sub&s;cribers.</P>
<P>From this I proceeded to give the Gentleman a further Objection, by asking him, as a twentieth Part of the Prin|cipal was annually paid in, why the Company did not pay to the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or a twentieth Part of the Bills?</P>
<P>The An&s;wer to it was &s;hortly this; There was no Nece&s;&s;ity for that, when the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or (as the Bills are in Credit) may daily purcha&s;e the Commodities he wants with them, and finally the Promi&s;e on the Face of the Bills, after the Expiration of twenty Years, obliges the Company to pay the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or for the &s;ame in the enumerated Commodities as cheap as if purcha&s;ed with Silver at 6s. &amp; 8d per Ounce, Penny for Penny. And be&s;ides, what anual Payments are
<PB N="11" REF="004541_0011_100D651433BF44C8">
made to the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or by the Publick on any of the publick Bills of Credit?</P>
<P>Another Objection I thought worthy of the Committee's Ob&s;ervation was. That the printed Scheme had not a&s;&s;ign'd certain particular Times, annually for the fixing or regu|lating the Prizes of &s;uch of the enumerated Manufactures, as &s;hall be brought to the Company's Trea&s;ury, but &s;eemed ab&s;olutely to leave it in the Power of the Directors and Trea&s;urer, to have the Countryman's Goods at their own Price, or not at all.</P>
<P>In An&s;wer to which it was &s;aid, that it would be ex|ceeding dangerous at certain particular Times annually to a&s;certain the Prizes of &s;uch Manufactures, for all Commo|dities ri&s;e and fall, according to the Scarcity or Glut of them, and as they are in Demand. And if the Prices &s;hould be regulated for a certain time, till the Time for regula|ting them comes again, it may frequently &s;o happen in the inter&s;pace of Time, that the Scarcity or Plenty of the Commodity, and the Demand of it, may va&s;tly alter the Price from &s;uch Regulation; however, what fully &s;ilences this Objection, the Committee have agreed al&s;o to alter their Sheme in this Particular, namely for encouraging the Indu&s;trious Man, to bring his Manufactures to the Compa|ny's Trea&s;ury, the Trea&s;urer &s;hall give <HI>one per Cent.</HI> more than the Market Price for them; and that the Buyer may be induced to deal with the Company, the Trea&s;urer is to &s;ell the &s;ame at <HI>one per Cent.</HI> le&s;s than the Market Price, and the &s;aid Lo&s;s of <HI>two per Cent.</HI> to be born by the Company. This Emendation I acknowledge greatly plea&s;ed me, being per&s;waded it will be no &s;mall additional Credit and Repu|tation to the Company.</P>
<P>And now thus &s;atisfied with the publick U&s;efulne&s;s and Ju&s;tice of the Projection, and the indi&s;pen&s;ible Ne|ce&s;&s;ity in our pre&s;ent Circum&s;tances, of &s;ome immediate Expedient: I inform'd the Committee I &s;hould not take up any more of their Time, about the Con&s;ideration of the Rules pre&s;cribed for the governing the Company, taking for granted they are in general &s;uch as are e&s;tab|li&s;hed
