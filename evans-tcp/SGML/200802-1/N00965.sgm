<P>THE Perfection and Exten&s;ive U&s;efulne&s;s of the Word of God, are eminently and admi|rably con&s;picuous in this, that the Duties of every Station are therein Propounded and adju&s;ted, from thence to be di&s;covered and learned. Superiours as well as Inferiours are here Coun&s;elled, In|&s;tructed, and Commanded: and tho&s;e who &s;tand upon a Level, are likewi&s;e advi&s;ed of their mutual Obligations.

In this Directory, tho&s;e of the <HI>Mi|litary</HI> Order are not overlook'd, nor left Un|di&s;ciplin'd: there are hints in it, not a few nor ob&s;cure, concerning the Religious con|duct, that all &s;uch are to be Solicitous about, and Exemplary in; how in the Name of the Lord, they are to lift up their Banners, and proceed in all their Enterprizes.

That the Memory of the Great Works of God, be tran&s;mitted unto, and pre|&s;erved among their Po&s;terity, hath been the Pious and Sedulous care of his People; and indeed his Glory is greatly concerned in it, a foundation being thus laid, of Prai&s;es to him in after Generations.

<P>The&s;e Words are &s;poken in the Name of Gods <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> with re&s;pect unto their Prepara|tions made, and Forces employed, again&s;t their common Enemies.

<P><HI>The People of GOD, when called to Employ their Arms again&s;t their Enemies, &s;hould be careful not to Tru&s;t in them, but in GOD for Salvation.</HI></P>
<P>This Doctrine comprizeth &s;everal things, and perhaps not improper for our Meditation at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>The People of God are often A&s;&s;aulted by, and greatly Expo&s;ed to the Rage and Violence of out|ward Enemies.</HI> There would be no need of <HI>Sword</HI> or <HI>Bow,</HI> where there no Enemies to en|counter; and had not Sin entred the World, there would not have been any. Perfect a|mity continued, until Sin made a Rupture. Man by his Revolt from God, lo&s;t that So|veraignty over the Creatures, which was at fir&s;t granted to, or ve&s;ted in him, &s;o that in|&s;tead of yielding Service and Subjection unto him, they often make head again&s;t, and &s;poil upon him. But furthermore, an unnatural Enmity of mankind again&s;t each other is the woful fruit of the Apo&s;tacy. The Lu&s;ts of men produce in them more Savage di&s;po&s;iti|ons, and oftimes engage them in more Barba|rous practices, then the greate&s;t Rage or Fiercene&s;s of bruit Creatures ever bewray'd.

They pur&s;ue each others de&s;truction with an implacable hatred, in&s;atiably thir&s;ting after blood, and delighting to imbrew their hands therein. The bloody Wars that have been carry'd on, from the fir&s;t Ages of the World, are an Undenyable Proof, of the deep cor|ruption of man's Nature: for who can ima|gine, that man was at fir&s;t framed, by a Be|ing of infinite Goodne&s;s, with any &s;uch qua|lities, as are then manife&s;ted? And it is a clear evidence of the dreadful Wrath of God, a|gain&s;t a Sinful World, that men &s;hould be the Executioners of each other, with a wor&s;e then ferocious cruelty. What a prodigious and frightful carriage, do &s;ome furious Battels and Sieges produce? Things could not po&s;&s;ibly have been at this pa&s;s, if man had continued in friend&s;hip with his Maker. But the Peo|ple of God, are of all others, mo&s;t obnoxious to the fury of Enemies; not that they give more occa&s;ion for it, but becau&s;e of the En|mity that is fix'd, between the Seed of the Woman and the Seed of the Serpent. The Little Flook of Chri&s;t, is hem'd round with devouring Wolves, who are always &s;piteing of it, gna&s;hing their teeth upon it, and oft|times actually making a prey thereof. From the days of <HI>Abel,</HI> and throughout the Succe&s;|&s;ive Ages of the World, the faithful Servants of God have been maligned, and maliciou&s;ly

The Church hath always had Ene|mies combining and con&s;piring for its Ruin, and tho&s;e not mean and contemptible, but mighty, and formidable. <HI>Her Adver&s;aries are the chief, her Enemies pro&s;per,</HI> Lam. 1. 5. How frequently were the Neighbouring Nations confederated, <HI>to root out the Name and Remem|brance of I&s;rael from the Earth?</HI> From the in|fancy of the Chri&s;tian Church, and wherever it hath made any figure, all manner of ho&s;tile methods, have been Employ'd to de&s;troy it.

blood-thir&s;ty di&s;po&s;ition, or an in&s;a|tiable ambitious humour. 'Tis notorious, that the principles upon which the mo&s;t un|dertake in War, are unju&s;tifyable, yea very hateful &amp; abominable; and that the mo&s;t of Wars, are as to their ri&s;e, &s;ource, and original extreamly evil. The Wars of Sovereign Prin|ces, and of free States, what are they for the mo&s;t part better than a more plau&s;ible and powerful Sort of Piracies? being de&s;ign'd <HI>to remove the bounds of the People, to rob their trea|&s;ures, and put down the Inhabitant,</HI> as was &s;poken of the A&s;&s;yrians incur&s;ions and conque&s;ts; <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 10. 7, 13. Although the&s;e things be rea|dily granted, yet the unlawfulne&s;s of War in all ca&s;es, may not from thence be concluded.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not now di&s;pute, nor undertake to determine what con&s;iderations, will Legiti|mate a War; but only ob&s;erve, that neither the <HI>Law of Nature,</HI> nor the <HI>Revelation</HI> of the Mind and Will of God in his <HI>Word,</HI> interdict the <HI>U&s;e of Arms,</HI> but it is countenanced, and warranted by both. This is con&s;onant to the impre&s;&s;ions and dictates of the Law of Nature, one principal branch whereof, is Self-defence, or pre&s;ervation. Mo&s;t evident is it, that a Government hath no &s;ecurity, again&s;t the Se|ditious, or in&s;urrections of Male Contents, nor again&s;t the Ho&s;tilities, Encroachments, and U&s;urpations of Forreigners; that there can

be no good Order maintained, nor Ju&s;tice have its free cour&s;e; that all Civil and Sa|cred Liberty would &s;oon be ravi&s;h'd by Un|rea&s;onable men; that Violence, Oppre&s;&s;ions and Rapine would univer&s;ally and unavoida|bly prevail; that Humane Societies (as things now are) mu&s;t disband, without the improve|ment of Military Weapons. Now if the in|&s;ults and Outrages of Enemies, cannot ordi|narily be prevented or repre&s;t without this, it may well be e&s;teemed a ju&s;t and lawful method.</P>
<P>And there is nothing repugnant hereunto in the Holy Scriptures: for however &s;paring|ly the Sacred Oracles may &s;peak in this mat|ter, becau&s;e the corrupt natures of men are apt to exceed and over-do herein, yet there are &s;ufficient mediums to confirm our A&s;&s;er|tion obvious in both Te&s;taments.

in the Gate.</HI> We find that &s;ome of the mo&s;t Eminent Saints, who&s;e Names and Acts are Enrolled in the Sacred Pages, have been fa|mous for Military Atchievements: And we al&s;o find in&s;tances of &s;ome in our Saviours days, and of his Apo&s;tles, who were Souldi|ers by profe&s;&s;ion, who had received and held their Commi&s;&s;ions from Heathen Rulers, and yet their faith is highly celebrated. And we find al&s;o Predictions in the <HI>Apocalyp&s;e,</HI> about the Wars of the Church with <HI>Antichri&s;t,</HI> which are propounded with manife&s;t approbation. And Authentick Hi&s;tory informs us, that many of the Primitive Chri&s;tians, Served the <HI>Roman</HI> Emperours in their Wars, and were ju&s;tly reputed the be&s;t or brave&s;t of their Souldiers: tho&s;e who apologized for them again&s;t their Per&s;ecutors, in&s;i&s;ted on this in|&s;tance of their Loyalty and U&s;efulne&s;s, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> their readine&s;s to bear Arms, and expertne&s;s to u&s;e them for the Publick Good: <HI>The Chri|&s;tian Legion was the wonder of the Empire, and the terrour of its Enemies.</HI></P>
<P>There have indeed been many Arguments advanced, to prove the work of a Souldier, and &s;o the u&s;e of Arms unlawful, both by per&s;ons of an Enthu&s;ia&s;tick Spirit, &amp; by &s;ome who have pretended to judge, more than o|thers, by Rea&s;on in matters of Religion: but all their preten&s;ions are ill-grounded, and of
<PB N="13" REF="001159_0014_0FB091022F12C418">
dangerous con&s;equence. It is ob&s;ervable, that the Arguments in&s;i&s;ted on by &s;uch, have a direct tendence to &s;ubvert or undermine the foundations of Civil Government; they bear hard upon the Magi&s;trates Office, who is by God him&s;elf entru&s;ted with the <HI>Sword,</HI> and who if he <HI>would not bear it in vain,</HI> mu&s;t &s;ometimes un&s;heath and weild it <HI>again&s;t tho&s;e who do evil.</HI> Whereas it is pleaded, that to u&s;e the Sword, is directly contrary to the de|&s;ign of the Go&s;pel, and to tho&s;e Le&s;&s;ons of Humility, Meekne&s;s, Patience, and Love that are therein given; the invalidity of the plea, may ea&s;ily be demon&s;trated. 'Tis true, <HI>Chri&s;t came not to de&s;troy mens lives; but to &s;ave them, Luk.</HI> 9. 56. and therefore a cruel &s;anguinary Spirit, ill becomes the profe&s;&s;ion of Di&s;ciple|&s;hip to &s;uch a Saviour: but that the profe&s;&s;i|on of Souldiers, doth not nece&s;&s;arily imply &s;uch a Spirit, is mo&s;t certain. The pre&s;er|vation, and not the de&s;truction of mens lives, is the primary end of that profe&s;&s;ion; the de&s;truction of none, any further than it is nece&s;&s;ary, &amp; conducive to the Publick Weal is to be pur&s;ued thereby. As for tho&s;e Directions given to Chri&s;tians, of <HI>not re&s;i&s;ting evil,</HI> of <HI>doing good to them that hate them, of recompencing to none evil for evil,</HI> of <HI>not avenging them&s;elves, but giving place to wrath,</HI> they are gro&s;ly &s;train'd &amp; wre&s;ted, if not under&s;tood and interpreted with re&s;pect

to private Retaliations. That the&s;e are not in|tended, to bind the hands of the Magi&s;trate, from taking due revenges on tho&s;e who di|&s;turb or endanger the Common-wealth, who would root out Religion, en&s;lave or de&s;troy the People, is manife&s;t from what is expre&s;t, in <HI>Rom.</HI> 13. 4. <HI>He is the Mini&s;ter of God, a Re|venger to execute wrath.</HI> 'Tis certain, that the Sword was not ordained to Convert the Na|tions from infidelity, but the Preaching of the Everla&s;ting Go&s;pel: As where the Go&s;|pel is aright entertained, there is a meek and lowly Spirit, &s;o to promote and propagate the intere&s;t thereof, agreeable methods &s;hould be u&s;ed: but this hinders not, but that the People of God, may with their Swords en|deavour to defend them&s;elves, confront their Enemies, and recover their own ju&s;t rights.</P>

<P>We are hence in&s;tructed, <HI>With what de&s;ign and frame of &s;pirit, Military Skill is to be &s;ought, and Military Preparations to be made.</HI> The&s;e are to be con&s;idered as means under God of the publick &s;afety, and accordingly to be pur&s;ued; but an intire Re&s;ignation &s;hould be made to him, and a due tru&s;t exerci&s;ed in him as to the &s;ucce&s;s thereof.</P>
<P>'Tis very commendable to be &s;eeking after skill in Military Science or Faculty, and the attainment thereof is a valuable Talent. However this is from God, and is his Gift; yet it is not to be expected from him imme|diately, but by his ble&s;&s;ing upon the indu&s;tri|ous u&s;e of proper means. <HI>Abraham</HI> took care that his Hou&s;hold Servants &s;hould be tutored to the u&s;e of Warlike Weapons, <HI>Gen.</HI> 14. 14.

And in ch. 12. 18. <HI>Men of War fitted for the Bat|tel, who could handle Shield and Buckler.</HI> They may well be accounted &s;ome of the mo&s;t u&s;eful per&s;ons in a Common-wealth, who ex|cel in &s;uch like &s;kill and endowments, and who are promoters thereof. What will Stores and Magazines &s;ignify, without men of Skill and Spirit to apply and manage them? But to &s;eek after Military Accompli&s;hments only as an Ornament, or piece of Gallantry, is vain: and yet le&s;s ju&s;tifyable is it, to attend Military Exerci&s;es as a &s;port or piece of pa&s;|time: if due references are not made herein, that time expended about them is but lo&s;t. <HI>It is acceptable to God, when proficiency in the Art Military is endeavoured, with a de&s;ign of Service to him and his Church;</HI> tho&s;e who don't thus regard it, do but trifle in their pretences a|bout it.</P>
<P>All due Preparations both to with&s;tand &amp; offend an Enemy, are proper &amp; incumbent, e&s;pecially in times of danger. 'Tis inexcu|&s;able folly to be negligent in this regard, for indeed none can aright tru&s;t in God, who are &s;lack as to the u&s;e of means ordained and afforded. Per&s;ons of a Military Order and Spirit, are therefore to be encouraged; tho&s;e who bear Arms for the Service of the Pub|lick,

&s;hould be well provided for, and re|warded: all needful Supplies of every kind procured and in a readine&s;s: but whatever care is u&s;ed in the&s;e things, it mu&s;t be with an eye to God, re&s;igning and commending all to his ble&s;&s;ing. In <HI>Nehemiah's</HI> time, when a &s;udden On&s;et was expected, from tho&s;e who were malignant again&s;t the intere&s;ts of the People, and of the Wor&s;hip of God, we have an account of his exemplary method, <HI>Neh.</HI> 4. 13, 14. <HI>I &s;et the people after their Fami|lies, with their Swords, their Spears, and their Bows: and &s;aid to the Nobles, to the Rulers, and unto the re&s;t of the People, be not ye afraid: Re|member the Lord which is Great and Terrible, &amp; fight for your Brethren, your Sons &amp; your Daugh|ters, your Wives, and your Hou&s;es.</HI> The pru|dence and Religion of <HI>Hezekiah,</HI> when a po|tent and victorious Adver&s;ary was approach|ing to the Gates of <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> we find record|ed, 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 32. 1&mdash;8. So then when the <HI>Bow</HI> and <HI>Sword</HI> are prepared, when &s;kill or dex|terity for the due improvement of the&s;e is endeavoured after, a Service for God and his People &s;hould be intended; but moreover there &s;hould be a re&s;t, relyance or depen|dence upon God, in order thereto.</P>
<P>All I &s;hall here add is this, that it is ju&s;tly to be accounted a mark of Divine De&s;ertion, when there is a general failure among a Peo|ple
