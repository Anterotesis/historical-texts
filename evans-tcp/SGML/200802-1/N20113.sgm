<HEAD>TREASURY DEPARTMENT.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE next mo&s;t important article of inquiry involved in the re&s;olutions of the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives of the twenty-third of January la&s;t; and in the ob|&s;ervations which have been made re&s;pecting the conduct of this department, relates to the loans negotiated under the acts of the fourth and twelfth of Augu&s;t, one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and ninety.</P>
<P>The papers which have been tran&s;mitted to the Hou&s;e by order of the Pre&s;ident, di&s;clo&s;e the following particulars&mdash;</P>
<P N="1">1. That the immediate &s;uperintendance of the bu&s;ine&s;s of the loans was confided to the department of the trea&s;ury, being naturally connected with it. This tru&s;t, be|&s;ides the original in&s;tructions for regulating the execution of it, which have been com|municated, was of cour&s;e &s;ubject to &s;uch directions from time to time, as the Pre&s;ident &s;hould think fit to give, or as occa&s;ions &s;hould require&mdash;A con&s;iderable latitude of di&s;|cretion, neverthele&s;s, from the very nature of the ca&s;e, attended it; &s;o as ju&s;tly to leave on the head of this department, a complete re&s;pon&s;ibility in all in&s;tances, where &s;pecial exceptions do not appear.</P>
<P N="2">2. That the fir&s;t loan which was obtained, was undertaken and completed by the agency of Wilhem and Jan Willink, and Nicolaas and Jacob Van Staphor&s;t and Hubbard, who both under the former and pre&s;ent government, have been and are the bankers of the United States at Am&s;terdam.</P>
<P N="3">3. That with the &s;ingle exception of the fir&s;t loan, William Short, E&s;q. then charge des affaires at the court of France, now re&s;ident mini&s;ter at the Hague, was con&s;tituted the &s;ole agent of this department, for carrying into effect the powers con|fided to it; with this qualification only, that if any negociation with a Prince or State, to whom any part of the debt to be di&s;charged by the loans was due, &s;hould be requi|&s;ite&mdash;the &s;ame was to be carried on through the per&s;on, who in capacity of mini&s;ter, charge des affaires, or otherwi&s;e, then was or thereafter might be charged, with tran&s;|acting the affairs of the United States, with &s;uch Prince or State.</P>
<P N="4">4. That all payments, which have been made out of the proceeds of the loans, have been made by the immediate and &s;pecial order of Mr. Short, except tho&s;e, upon the bills of the Trea&s;urer for the monies drawn to this country, and tho&s;e to the mo|ney lenders in Holland; which were made in cour&s;e by our bankers, at the periods they re&s;pectively became due.&mdash;This con&s;equently embraces all the payments to France; the very la&s;t of which, though agreed for by Mr. Morris, in con&s;equence of his having been employed for a &s;pecial purpo&s;e by Mr. Short, was not, and could not, be completed, but by the &s;ame <HI>immediate</HI> and <HI>&s;pecial</HI> direction of Mr. Short.</P>
<P>It moreover appears, from the &s;ame papers, and more fully from the corre&s;pon|dence at large, now before the Senate, that except in the particular in&s;tance which has been ju&s;t &s;tated, with regard to Mr. Morris, there has been no other agency in the whole bu&s;ine&s;s, than that of Mr. Short, and of the bankers at Am&s;terdam and Antwerp, whom he nece&s;&s;arily employed as in&s;truments in the negociation with the money lenders, and in the receipt and di&s;bur&s;ement of the monies borrowed.&mdash;The&s;e as already mentioned, were at Am&s;terdam, the two hou&s;es of Wilhem and Jan Wil|link, and of Nicolaas and Jacob Van Staphor&s;t and Hubbard; at Antwerp a Mr. G. De Wolf, was the banker.</P>
<P>It may not be without its u&s;es to add, that the monies proceeding from the loans, have con&s;tantly remained in the hands of the re&s;pective bankers, till they have been paid over to the creditors; namely, the French trea&s;ury, or their bankers, the money lenders or their repre&s;entatives, the holders of the bills drawn from this country by the Trea&s;urer. Neither Mr. Short nor Mr. Morris, has ever had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a &s;in|gle guilder. The latter indeed has never even had power over <HI>one,</HI> excepting merely a &s;um of 105,000 guilders, by letters of mine dated the 13th September la&s;t, placed at his di&s;po&s;al for paying <HI>at Paris,</HI> according to &s;tipulation, the intere&s;t on the debt due to foreign officers. The fact is, and it is &s;o demon&s;trated by the corre&s;pondence already referred to, that I never wrote a line to Mr. Morris on the &s;ubject of the loans or their proceeds, but in reference to the ca&s;e, ju&s;t mentioned of the intere&s;t payable to foreign officers; in re&s;pect to which local &s;ituation governed.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="026347_0003_0FCFB64DAA830E80">
One more circum&s;tance only is nece&s;&s;ary to be noticed in this place, with a view to the elucidation intended: It is this&mdash;that the la&s;t payment, though originating prior to the change in the political po&s;ition of France of the 10th of Augu&s;t la&s;t, not having been con&s;ummated 'till the 6th of September following, f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ll of cour&s;e under the di&s;po&s;ition of tho&s;e then in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the power of the nation.</P>
<P>It could not but have been unexpected to me, that exception &s;hould be taken to the report lately made by me on the &s;ubject of foreign loans, for the omi&s;&s;ion of details which I did not at the time, and do not yet, conceive, to have been called for, by the terms of the re&s;olutions upon which it was founded. The reque&s;t addre&s;&s;ed to the Pre&s;ident, by tho&s;e re&s;olutions, was, that he would cau&s;e to be laid before the Hou&s;e, a particular account of the <HI>&s;ums borrowed under his authority</HI> by the United States, the <HI>terms</HI> on which each loan was obtained, the <HI>applications,</HI> which had been made <HI>of the monies,</HI> agreeably to appropriations, the <HI>balances,</HI> if any, which remained unapplied, &s;pecifying al&s;o at what <HI>times intere&s;t commenced</HI> on the &s;everal &s;ums obtained, and at what <HI>times it was &s;topped</HI> by the &s;everal payments made. It was not natural to imagine that the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions were de&s;igned to comprehend a &s;pecification of the <HI>preci&s;e autho|rities,</HI> under which the loans were negotiated, of the <HI>names</HI> of the <HI>per&s;ons,</HI> by whom they were negotiated, of the particular <HI>place</HI> or <HI>places,</HI> where the balance unexpended of the &s;ums that had been drawn for to the United States, were <HI>depo&s;ited.</HI> Still le&s;s natural was it for me to anticipate &s;urmi&s;es, which could give to &s;uch particulars the &s;hadow of importance. But as animadver&s;ions have attended the omi&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e de|tails, I ought to regard it as an admonition to me, to be more full and preci&s;e in my pre&s;ent communication; a motive which co-operates with my de&s;ire, to throw all po&s;|&s;ible light upon the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t general circum&s;tance, which requires to be noticed and explained, after the particulars that have been communicated is this&mdash;That all the loans which have been hitherto obtained, have been made under the authority of both acts, without particular reference to either.</P>
<P>The idea originally entertained, was to conduct them on a different plan, founding each loan upon one or the other of the acts; as will be &s;een by my letter of the 28th of Augu&s;t, 1790, to our bankers at Am&s;terdam; at the &s;ame time, that it will appear, from the &s;ame letter, that the &s;eparation did not appear to me a matter of con&s;equence, and that I anticipated the po&s;&s;ibility of a difficulty in adhering to it in the particular ca&s;e. That difficulty, proved in the opinion of the bankers, to be of &s;ufficient mo|ment to render the arrangement contemplated, under the circum&s;tances of the ca&s;e un|advi&s;eable; as they inform me in their an&s;wer to the abovementioned letter.</P>
<P>But prior to the receipt of that an&s;wer, further enquiry and reflection had deter|mined me to abandon my original idea&mdash;as likely to produce embarra&s;&s;ment and in|convenience, both in the negotiation of the loans, and in the application of their pro|ceeds. It was accordingly concluded to let the loans proceed indi&s;criminately, upon both acts.</P>
<P>The&s;e loans were to have reference to two purpo&s;es&mdash;fir&s;t, the reimbur&s;ement of the foreign debt; &s;econd, the purcha&s;e of the dome&s;tic debt at its market price.</P>
<P>There were weighty rea&s;ons for carrying on both the&s;e operations concurrently. The arrears to France had been a con&s;iderable time accumulating. It was in every &s;en&s;e proper that a reimbur&s;ement of them &s;hould begin without delay, and de&s;ireable for obvious rea&s;ons, that it &s;hould go on without any very con&s;iderable cha&s;ms or in|termi&s;&s;ions. This manner of proceeding could not but have the faire&s;t chance of being the mo&s;t &s;atisfactory and convenient to France; unle&s;s indeed the bu&s;ine&s;s were to have proceeded upon the principle of an entire po&s;tponement of the dome&s;tic object, to that of the reimbur&s;ement.</P>
<P>But very cogent rea&s;ons rendered this cour&s;e not the mo&s;t eligible&mdash;The early com|mencement of purcha&s;es of the debt, was a matter of real and great importance.</P>
<P>It was important in two relations; as it regarded the advantages to the government, from redeeming a portion of the debt at low prices; and &s;till more, as it regarded the &s;avings to the country from rai&s;ing the price of &s;tock on foreign purcha&s;ers; the beneficial influence upon the credit of the nation abroad and at home, to be expected from a quick appreciation of the public obligations; the benefit to the public credi|tors in general, and to the mo&s;t meritorious cla&s;&s;es of them in particular, which would re&s;ult from the &s;ame cau&s;e; all which objects were &s;ugge&s;ted from the trea&s;ury, as motives to the provi&s;ion re&s;pecting purcha&s;es, and are evidently contemplated in the preamble of the act, which makes that provi&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="026347_0004_0FCFB64FD9DA4170">
Exclu&s;ive of the other advantages, which have been cited, and which are of a nature truly precious and important, that of preventing foreigners from acquiring the pro|perty of our citizens at a great undervalue is too obvious not to be e&s;timated, as it ought to be, at fir&s;t &s;ight. It cannot require argument to &s;hew how great an evil it was, that foreigners &s;hould be able to acquire with nine or ten, that for which the country would ultimately have to pay them twenty, with full intere&s;t in the interval; nor how much it merited the attention of the government to prevent or le&s;&s;en &s;o &s;e|rious an evil.</P>
<P>But the influence which the purcha&s;es by the government may have had upon this event may not be equally obvious. It is however not difficult to be traced. Price naturally keeps pac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> with competition and demand; whatever increa&s;es the latter, nece&s;&s;arily tends to an augmentation of the former. Merely then as another purcha|&s;er, by adding to the competition and demand, the purcha&s;es of the government, were calculated to influence a ri&s;e of price. But they had an effect more than proportioned to their real extent. Imagination has much to do in all &s;uch que&s;tions, and in &s;carce|ly any thing &s;o much as in what relates to public funds. Experience proves, that it is here exerted with uncommon effort. The appearance of the government as a pur|cha&s;er has not failed to excite the expectation of a greater demand than was real, be|cau&s;e the extent of the re&s;ources to be employed, might be very great, and was un|known; which by &s;timulating the zeal of tho&s;e who wanted to buy, le&s;t the price &s;hould ri&s;e &s;uddenly and con&s;iderably upon them, and by encouraging tho&s;e who wanted to &s;ell, under the hope of a better price, to hold back the commodity, has in both ways generally contributed to give a &s;pring to the market. Prices once rai&s;ed, when founded on intrin&s;ic value, tend to maintain them&s;elves; becau&s;e tho&s;e who have given them, are for the mo&s;t part intere&s;ted in keeping them up. And every new impul&s;e, which they receive, &s;erves to carry them rapidly to their ju&s;t level.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who have been mo&s;t attentive to the operation of the public purcha&s;es, will have the lea&s;t doubt that they had a material agency, in accelerating the appreciation of the public &s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ck.</P>
<P>An enquiry naturally ari&s;es here&mdash;Were the monies which were drawn from Eu|rope on account of the foreign loans, the in&s;trument of the purcha&s;es, to which the&s;e beneficial effects are a&s;cribed?</P>
<P>I an&s;wer, that the&s;e purcha&s;es are to be attributed to the in&s;trumentality of that fund&mdash;that had it not been for this re&s;ource, they could not have been made at the early periods, when mo&s;t of them were made. The cour&s;e of the tran&s;action will be fully and with more propriety explained in another place.</P>
<P>An attention to both objects&mdash;to the reimbur&s;ements to France, and to the purcha&s;es of the debt, rendered expedient a &s;ubdivi&s;ion even of the fir&s;t loan. Con&s;iderations of the moment &s;econded tho&s;e of a general nature, to induce an immediate payment to that country&mdash;The loan had been undertaken without previous authority from hence, with a view to &s;uch payment. This was known and a corre&s;pondent expect|ation excited. The immediate &s;ituation of the French finances, rendered a payment at the particular juncture more than ordinarily intere&s;ting. In &s;uch a &s;tate of things, there could be no he&s;itation, about applying a large part of the loan to that object. Another part of it was of nece&s;&s;ity applied to the payment of the &s;ums, that were fal|ling due on the Dutch loans. And it is pre&s;umed, that the rea&s;ons which have been a&s;&s;igned, will appear to have been &s;ufficiently powerful to have dictated the drawing of a part of it to the United States.</P>
<P>Accordingly, a million and a half of the three millions borrowed, were appropriated to France, &s;omething more than 800,000 guilders were drawn for here, and the re|mainder of the loan was left to be di&s;bur&s;ed in Holland.</P>
<P>It &s;hall not be concealed, though I am aware that the acknowledgment may be a &s;ubject of critici&s;m, that the conduct which was pur&s;ued, both with regard to this and to the &s;ucceeding loan, was in &s;ome degree, influenced by a collateral con&s;ideration. The government had but ju&s;t adopted a plan for the re&s;toration of public credit. The periodical payment of intere&s;t was to commence on the 1&s;t of April 1791. A con&s;ide|rable part of the revenue out of which the monies were to ari&s;e was only to begin to accrue on the fir&s;t of January preceding. This revenue was liable to credits of four, &s;ix, and twelve months.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="026347_0005_0FCFB652C3073908">
How far its eventual product would an&s;wer expectation&mdash;how far the punctuality of payments could be relied upon, were points una&s;certained, and which required to their a&s;certainment much more experience than had been obtained. In &s;uch a &s;itua|tion it was not only natural, but nece&s;&s;ary for an admini&s;trator of the finances to doubt&mdash;and doubting it was his duty to call to the aid of the public credit, every auxiliary, which it was in his power to command&mdash;He was bound to reflect, that a failure in any &s;tipulated payment would be fatal to the dawning credit of the country&mdash;to the reputation of the government, ju&s;t begining to ri&s;e. That a wound inflicted upon either, at &s;o early a &s;tage, under all the circum&s;tances of oppo&s;ition to the con|&s;titution, which had exi&s;ted in the community, would have been deeply felt, and might either not have admitted of a cure at all&mdash;or not till after a length of time, and a &s;eries of mi&s;chiefs&mdash;that it could not but be an important &s;ervice rendered to the country, to ward off &s;o great a misfortune, by the temporary u&s;e of any extraordinary re&s;ource, which might be at hand, till time was given for more effectual provi&s;ion.</P>
<P>If in the cour&s;e of &s;uch reflections, a doubt had occurred, about the &s;trict regula|rity of what was contemplated, as a po&s;&s;ible re&s;ort, a mind &s;ufficiently alive to the public intere&s;t, and &s;ufficiently firm in the pur&s;uit of it, would have di&s;mi&s;&s;ed that doubt, as an ob&s;tacle, &s;ugge&s;ted by a pu&s;illanimous caution, to the exerci&s;e of tho&s;e higher motives, which ought ever to govern a man, inve&s;ted with a great public tru&s;t. It would have occurred, that there was rea&s;onable ground to rely, that the nece&s;&s;ity of the ca&s;e, and the magnitude of the occa&s;ion, would in&s;ure a ju&s;tification, and that if the contrary &s;hould happen, there remained &s;till the con&s;olation of having &s;a|crificed per&s;onal intere&s;t and tranquility, no matter to what extent, to an important public intere&s;t, and of having avoided the humiliation, which would have been ju&s;tly due to an oppo&s;ite, and to a feeble conduct.</P>
<P>The di&s;po&s;ition which was re&s;olved upon with regard to the fir&s;t loan, involved ne|ce&s;&s;arily a deci&s;ion of the point, that the loans might be placed on the joint founda|tion of both acts. That loan having been undertaken, as already mentioned, with|out previous authority, and con&s;equently without a particular eye to either act, it was probable, that it would be found too late to make an apportionment of one part of the &s;um borrowed to one act, of another part to the other act. In that ca&s;e, the di&s;tri|butive application of the fund to the different objects was to be relinqui&s;hed or the po&s;&s;ibility was to be admitted, of the loan being left to &s;tand upon the authority of both acts. The &s;ame di&s;po&s;ition of the fir&s;t loan, will al&s;o illu&s;trate the convenience and expediency of the plan which was finally adopted, that is, of placing the loans on the ba&s;is of both acts.</P>
<P>The idea of a concurrent execution of both the objects to which the loans were de&s;|tined, could not conveniently have been pur&s;ued, upon the plan of a &s;eparation of the loans; which to be effectual, would include the &s;trict application of the proceeds of each to the purpo&s;es of the particular act, upon which it was founded.</P>
<P>Am&s;terdam was naturally looked to, as the great &s;cene of the intended loans. There, as every where el&s;e, there is but a certain quantity of money floating in the market from time to time, beyond the nece&s;&s;ary demands of trade and indu&s;try, &s;eek|ing for employment in loans. This quantity of cour&s;e varies at different periods, from a variety of cau&s;es. Of the quantity at any time afloat, but a certain propor|tion can be commanded by any one borrowing power; owing to the competition of other borrowers, who have each their connections through their bankers, with dif|ferent &s;ets of undertakers and money lenders. Nor it is always that con&s;iderable loans can be had at any rate. There are certain &s;ea&s;ons only, when they are practicable.</P>
<P>To have brought two loans upon the market at one time, as an opportunity of borrowing offered, which mu&s;t have been the ca&s;e in order to make concurrent pro|vi&s;ion for both the objects in que&s;tion, if the principle of a &s;eparation of the loans had been adopted, would have been to exhibit to the money lenders a very unu&s;ual ap|pearance. With men known to be much influenced by precedent and habit, &s;uch an appearance could not have failed to prove a &s;ource of &s;peculation and conjecture; and might have led to a confu&s;ed idea that the wants of the United States were ex|ce&s;&s;ive; a &s;uppo&s;ition, by no means calculated to promote their credit. It would moreover have been a departure from that &s;implicity of procedure, which where num|bers are concerned is always of moment to a right conception of the bu&s;ine&s;s to be accompli&s;hed, and ought not to be abandoned, but for rea&s;ons of real utility <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> weight.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="026347_0006_0FCFB65448BC2520">
To have in&s;tituted the loans &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ounding each, upon one or the other of the acts, would have had a tendency to occa&s;ion longer intervals between the payments to France, than was de&s;ireable. The intervention of a loan for the purpo&s;e of pur|cha&s;es, would have created of cour&s;e a very con&s;iderable cha&s;m. It may be objected that &s;uch cha&s;ms did happen on the plan which was pur&s;ued. This is true in two in|&s;tances; but the mo&s;t material of the two proceeded from ca&s;ualties foreign to the plan it&s;elf; which are detailed in the corre&s;pondence more than once alluded to.</P>
<P>It is po&s;&s;ible too that a &s;eparation of the loans might have rendered it le&s;s ea&s;y to take advantage of a &s;tate of the market, favourable to their exten&s;ion at a particular juncture. The loan to be brought on the market might relate to the purcha&s;e of the debt. The moment might be favourable to a more con&s;iderable loan, than was with|in the limits pre&s;cribed for that object, and the opportunity might &s;lip before a &s;econd could be in&s;tituted. In this bu&s;ine&s;s moments are often of importance, and are to be embraced with promptitude and dexterity.</P>
<P>Thus it appears, that in different ways the negociotion of the loans might have been embarra&s;&s;ad by their &s;eparation.</P>
<P>But the mo&s;t obvious, if not the mo&s;t &s;erious of the inconveniencies which would have attended it, re&s;pects the application of the &s;ums borrowed. This could not then have been moulded, as the intere&s;t or policy of the government might dictate. A loan for the pur|cha&s;e of the debt might have been made under pro&s;pects, promi&s;ing a ready and be|neficial inve&s;tment of it; but before the inve&s;tment was made, a change of the market might render it ineligible&mdash;involving the alternative, either of a di&s;advantageous inve&s;t|ment, or of leaving perhaps a large &s;um of money a long time unemployed. Such a &s;tate of things might have produced to the banks an advantage, and to the government a lo&s;s, of magnitude, &s;ufficient to give colour to a &s;urmi&s;e, that the public intere&s;t had been &s;acrificed to the profit of tho&s;e in&s;titutions. The contrary cour&s;e has e&s;&s;entially avoided that evil; which in this and in other in&s;tances, would have been incident in a far greater degree, to the modes of proceeding, contra&s;ted with tho&s;e that have been pur&s;ued, than has in reality attended them.</P>
<P>Or political con&s;iderations might have rendered it advi&s;eable to transfer the ap|plication of the fund from one object to the other.</P>
<P>Of this the ca&s;e of St. Domingo pre&s;ents an example. It might have happened on the plan of &s;eparate loans, that there was no fund in hand but for the purcha&s;e of the debt. Then on the principle of that plan, there would have been no fund in the di&s;|po&s;ition of the executive, applicable to the other object, which would have embarra&s;&s;ed the performance of a duty towards a friendly power, and in a way which included the po&s;itive advantage to the country of paying directly a part of its foreign debt, in its own productions.</P>
<P>Such were the embarra&s;&s;ments avoided, and &s;uch the conveniences &s;ecured, by the plan of making the loans indi&s;criminately, upon the authority of both acts.</P>
<P>In the oppo&s;ite plan, I can di&s;cern no counterbalancing advantage not convenience.</P>
<P>Con&s;equently, if both are equally legal, there can be no doubt which of them ought to have been preferred.</P>
<P>If there be any want of legality in the plan which has been pur&s;ued, I was not at the time, and am not yet &s;en&s;ible of it.</P>
<P>I know of no rule which renders it illegal in an agent, having from the &s;ame princi|pal two authorities to borrow money, whether for one or different purpo&s;es, to unite the loans he may make, upon the foundation of both authorities: Provided the terms of them be con&s;onant with both or either of his commi&s;&s;ions. If the purpo&s;es are dif|ferent, it will be incumbent upon him, to take care that the application of the monies borrowed makes the proper &s;eparation; and doing this he will have fulfilled his tru&s;t. To te&s;t this po&s;ition it &s;eems only nece&s;&s;ary to a&s;k, whether the principal in &s;uch ca&s;e would not be fully bound to the lenders?</P>
<P>In reflecting originally upon the regularity of the proceeding meditated, there was but one &s;ource of he&s;itation; the difference in the funds upon which the loans were to re&s;t. But the following rea&s;oning &s;atisfied the &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ruple: The pledging of particular funds is for the &s;ecurity of the lenders. If they are willing to wave the &s;pecial &s;ecurity, by lending on the general credit of the government, or to di&s;pen&s;e with the preference of one fund to another, where two are pledged, by lending indi&s;criminately on the cre|dit of both, the one or the other circum&s;tance mu&s;t be alike indifferent to the govern|ment. The authority will have been well ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">uted&punc; to the extent nece&s;&s;ary for pub|lic

purpo&s;es, and if any thing remains unexecuted, it will be in enlargement, not in abridgement of the public rights. It is however pre&s;umed, that the practical con&s;truc|tion, in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e will be, that the two funds pledged will con&s;titute an aggre|gate, for the joint &s;ecurity of the monies borrowed upon both acts.</P>
<P>The &s;econd general circum&s;tance re&s;pecting the foreign loans, negotiated under the acts of the 4th and 12th of Augu&s;t, which requires attention, relates to the terms on which they have been obtained. The&s;e, it appears have been repre&s;ented, as neither honorable nor advantageous.</P>
<P>The following facts, witne&s;&s;ed by the corre&s;pondence before the Senate, more than once referred to, and well known to all who have had opportunities of information, demon&s;trate, that the terms of tho&s;e loans, have been both honorable and advantageous.</P>
<P N="1">1. There is not one of them, which originated under the acts, that was not effected upon conditions equally favorable with tho&s;e attending the loans of the cotemporary borrowing powers of the mo&s;t tried re&s;ources and be&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hed credit, and more fa|vorable than were obtainable by &s;ome powers of great re&s;pectability.</P>
<P N="2">2. The United States took a lead in the market, in regard to the &s;ub&s;equent reduc|tions of intere&s;t; having had either earlier or more complete &s;ucce&s;s than any other borrowing power.</P>
<P N="3">3. From a rate of five per cent. intere&s;t, and four and a half per cent. charges, which marked the level of the market when they begun their loans, they in the cour&s;e of a &s;ingle year, brought down the terms to four per cent. intere&s;t, and five per cent. charges; that is from an intere&s;t on the nett &s;um received (including an indemnifi|cation for charges) of 5.5012, &s;omething more than five and a half per cent. to an in|tere&s;t on the like &s;um of 4.4951, &s;omething le&s;s than 4&frac12; per cent.</P>
<P>When this &s;tate of things is applied to a government, only in the third year of its exi&s;tence, and to a country which had &s;o recently emerged from a total derangement of its finances, it would &s;eem impo&s;&s;ible to deny that the i&s;&s;ue is not only honorable, but flattering; unle&s;s indeed it can be denied, that a &s;ound and vigorous &s;tate of cre|dit is honorable to a nation.</P>
<P>I forbear a compari&s;on between the loans of the pre&s;ent, and of the former govern|ment of this country, becau&s;e an immen&s;e di&s;parity of circum&s;tances would render it an improper one&mdash;further than to take notice of a very great error which has been upon &s;ome occa&s;ions advanced. It has been alledged, to di&s;parage the management, under the pre&s;ent, that the loans of the former government, in a &s;ituation comparative|ly very di&s;advantageous, have been effected upon equal terms; and in proof of this an appeal has been made to the loan of 2,000,000 of guilders at four per cent. which is that of the 9th March, 1784.</P>
<P>Nothing can manife&s;t more clearly than this, the very precipitate and &s;uperficial views, with which &s;ugge&s;tions on important public &s;ubjects, are &s;ometimes made. The la&s;t four per cent. loan obtained under the exi&s;ting laws, including charges, is a real four and a half per cent. loan, or more exactly a 4.4951 per cent. loan. The four per cent. loan of March 1784, is a real 6.6468 per cent. loan. The difference which ex|ceeds 2 per cent. ari&s;es principally from extra premiums and gratifications which were allowed upon this loan, and which are unknown to the other.</P>
<P>Much prai&s;e is no doubt due to the exertions which effected the loans under the for|mer government. A &s;uperiority of merit, &s;hall readily be conceded to them, from the circum&s;tances under which they were made, and their &s;ignal utility in the revo|lution. But it is not nece&s;&s;ary to their eulogium to affirm, that they were made upon equal terms with tho&s;e lately obtained, or to deny the goodne&s;s of the terms of the lat|ter. Truth will not ju&s;tify the one or the other.</P>
<P>The facts which have been &s;tated prove, that the terms of the loans are advanta|geous as well as honorable. They are comparatively advantageous, becau&s;e they are as moderate as other powers in the be&s;t credit have allowed; and they are ab&s;olutely advantageous, becau&s;e the highe&s;t <HI>real</HI> not <HI>nominal</HI> rate of intere&s;t, which has been given does not exceed 5.5012, a fraction more than 5&frac12; per cent. while the lowe&s;t <HI>real</HI> rate is 4.4951, a fraction le&s;s than 4&frac12; per cent.</P>
<P>If the que&s;tion whether advantageous or not be te&s;ted by the purpo&s;es for which the loans have been made, the conclu&s;ion is equally in their favour&mdash;The payments on account of the foreign debt were an indi&s;pen&s;able obligation. Unle&s;s it can be &s;hewn that they might have been derived from another and more advantageous &s;ource, it will follow that it was the intere&s;t of the government to avail it&s;elf of the re&s;ource which has been employed, becau&s;e it was its duty to di&s;charge its obligations.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="026347_0008_0FCFB65749EACD98">
It is &s;ometimes urged, that foreign loans for whatever purpo&s;e are pernicious, be|cau&s;e they &s;erve to drain the country of its &s;pecie for the payment of intere&s;t, and for the final reimbur&s;ement of principal&mdash;that it would be preferable for that rea&s;on to procure loans at home, even at a higher rate of intere&s;t.</P>
<P>To this, &s;everal an&s;wers may be given, &s;ome of a &s;pecial, others of a general nature.</P>
<P>In reference to the reimbur&s;ement of the foreign debt, it may be ob&s;erved, that as a debt had already been incurred abroad, upon which intere&s;t was payable, the con|tracting of new loans there for the reimbur&s;ement of that debt, would leave us, as to the demand for the exportation of our &s;pecie, ju&s;t where we originally &s;tood.</P>
<P>Moreover if the money could have been borrowed at home, for that reimbur&s;ement, the remittance of it would have been ruinous to the country. The mere nece&s;&s;ity of remitting could not alone have increa&s;ed the foreign demand for our commodities; &s;o as to deduce from an extra exportation of them, the requi&s;ite means of payment; and if our &s;pecie was to perform the office, the country would &s;peedily have been ex|hau&s;ted to a degree incon&s;i&s;tent with the &s;upport of its commerce and indu&s;try. The quantity of coin in the United States has never been con&s;iderable enough for &s;uch an operation.</P>
<P>But this very &s;tate of things would have rendered the procuring of the money from dome&s;tic re&s;ources impracticable. The&s;e it may be &s;afely affirmed are too limited for exten&s;ive loans, of any con&s;iderable degree of permanency.</P>
<P>In the la&s;t place&mdash;The expedient of dome&s;tic loans, would not prevent the evil, which is de&s;ired to be prevented. Foreigners would either in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, bring their monies to &s;ub&s;cribe them to the loans, or, they would afterwards, purcha&s;e the &s;tock ari&s;ing from them; and in either ca&s;e they would equally draw away the money of the country on account of their intere&s;t and principal. The only con&s;equence of giving a di&s;proportionate rate of intere&s;t for dome&s;tic loans would be, that our &s;pecie would be carried away &s;o much the fa&s;ter.</P>
<P>Experience having &s;hewn, that nations &s;ometimes pay more regard to their external than to their internal credit, this con&s;ideration co-operates with rea&s;ons of conveni|ence to induce monied men abroad, to be content with a lower rate of intere&s;t, &s;tipu|lated to be paid in their own country, than if the place of payment be in another country; making even a greater difference, than is an equivalent for the expence and ri&s;k of obtaining remittances.</P>
<P>The clear inference from the&s;e ob&s;ervations, is that with regard to the reimbur&s;e|ment of the foreign debt, no other expedient than that of foreign loans was practicable or eligible.</P>
<P>The utility of that part of the loans, which has reference to the purcha&s;e of the debt; has already been explained in certain views. So far as their agency has been hitherto concerned in that operation, it is a &s;ufficient demon&s;tration of the advantage of the mea&s;ure to &s;tate, that the &s;um inve&s;ted in purcha&s;es up to the period of the la&s;t report to Congre&s;s has redeemed what is equal to an annuity of 6.15 per cent. inclu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">g al&s;o the advantage of &s;inking a capital more than 50 per cent. greater than the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">um expended.</P>
<P>A valuable profit will ari&s;e from the inve&s;tment of the &s;ums on hand, either in a payment to the bank or in the purcha&s;e of &s;tock. The liberation of an annuity of &s;ix per cent. can be &s;ecured&mdash;while upon a great part of the fund which is to effect it no more than 4&frac12; per cent. is payable, and le&s;s than 5&frac12; upon the other part. The mean of the&s;e rates being 5 per cent. an annual &s;aving of one per cent. may be effected, which upon 2,000,000 of dollars, intere&s;t at 5 per cent. is equal to a capital or gro&s;s &s;um of 400,000 dollars; an item certainly of no incon&s;iderable con&s;equence.</P>
<P>Again&s;t the advantages, which are claimed in favour of the loans, it is natural to place the lo&s;s of intere&s;t incident to the delays, which have attended their application to the purpo&s;es, for which they were obtained. This leads to an examination of the ca&s;es of delay, their cau&s;es, the circum&s;tances if any, which counterbalance them.</P>
<P>There are three in&s;tances of material delay&mdash;one re&s;pecting the fir&s;t loan, another the &s;econd loan, and a third, a part of the two la&s;t loans.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t loan, it will be &s;een, was not applied till a con&s;iderable time after its commencement. It has been already intimated that it was undertaken without previ|ous authority from this country. The motives to the mea&s;ure are detailed in a letter from our bankers of the 25th of January, 1790, a copy of which accompanies the
<PB N="10" REF="026347_0009_0FCFB658F7683828">
communications herewith made by order of the Pre&s;ident. A regard to tho&s;e motives led to an acceptance of the loan. Nor could it have been deemed an unfortunate cir|cum&s;tance, that &s;uch an auxiliary to the operations of the trea&s;ury had been previou&s;ly prepared.</P>
<P>The laws authorizing the loans, pa&s;&s;ed the 4th and 12th of Augu&s;t. As early as the 28th of that month, the acceptance above-mentioned was communicated, and the application of 1,500,000 florins, in a payment to France directed. So far no time was lo&s;t, more than could not have been avoided.</P>
<P>But the bills for the &s;um to be brought here were not drawn till &s;ome months after. This proceeded from an unwillingne&s;s to ri&s;k the public credit, by drawing before there was a certainty of funds to an&s;wer the drafts. It was not impo&s;&s;ible, that the great delay which had attended the pa&s;&s;ing of the law for borrowing, might have led the bankers to come to &s;ome arrangement with the money lenders, for &s;urrendering the monies paid in, and terminating the loan. Independent of this &s;ource of appre|hen&s;ion, they had expre&s;&s;ed them&s;elves, in their letter communicating the &s;tep they had taken, to this effect. "To &s;pare the United States all po&s;&s;ible advance of inte|re&s;t, while the money &s;hall remain unappropriated, we &s;hall i&s;&s;ue the recipi&s;&s;es at the option of the buyers to take them <HI>&s;o late as they plea&s;e,</HI> on the expectation the three mil|lions would be placed in a few months." This, though it announced an expectation that the monies would be paid in, in a few months, did not render the event certain. And as the bankers appeared from that precaution, to have adverted to the idea of &s;aving the United States an advance of intere&s;t, it was &s;uppo&s;eable that they might have found means &s;till further to procra&s;tinate the payments, or a con&s;iderable part of them, till they had received a confirmation of the loan. This policy would have been the more natural, as they ri&s;ked the lo&s;s of intere&s;t them&s;elves, if the tran&s;ac|tion &s;hould not have been finally ratified.</P>
<P>Under &s;uch circum&s;tances I thought it mo&s;t prudent to defer the drafts, 'till advice was received of the actual progre&s;s of the loans. There was no room to he&s;itate be|tween the lo&s;s of a &s;mall &s;um in intere&s;t, and the danger of committing the public credit by a premature operation.</P>
<P>The &s;econd ca&s;e of delay relates to the &s;econd loan. It was occa&s;ioned by a deter|mination to &s;u&s;pend the orders for its application, till information was received, of its having been contracted for.</P>
<P>One motive to this determination has been already intimated; namely, the yet untried and immature &s;tate of our fi&s;cal arrangements. The general rea&s;oning on this head, was &s;trengthened by an occurrence altogether unlooked for, which di&s;clo|&s;ed it&s;elf on the 23d of August 1790, eleven days after the ri&s;ing of Congre&s;s; an occurrence which they had not contemplated in their pecuniary di&s;po&s;itions. I al|lude to the commencement of an Indian war; which was announced in a letter from governor St. Clair, dated on the above-mentioned day; the progre&s;&s;ive extent and con&s;equences of which could of cour&s;e not be fore&s;een. Under &s;uch circum&s;tances, I judged it for the public intere&s;t and &s;afety to hold the re&s;ource, which the pro&s;pect of a loan pre&s;ented, under the power of the trea&s;ury, till advice &s;hould be received of the actual in&s;titution of the loan; with intention then to di&s;po&s;e of it as &s;hould ap|pear advi&s;eable, under a better matured view of our pecuniary &s;ituation and pro&s;pects.</P>
<P>Hence the delay which attended the application of the &s;econd loan; the fir&s;t in fact that originated &s;ub&s;equent to the laws for borrowing. But after advice had been re|ceived of its having been &s;et on foot, no time was lo&s;t in converting it with due di&s;|patch to its proper u&s;es. There was only, not an anticipation of its application. As early as May 24th, 1791. I wrote a letter to Mr. Short (a copy of which is in po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of the hou&s;e) empowering him to apply the proceeds of all future loans, as they &s;hould accrue, in payments to France; except as to &s;uch &s;ums as therein were, or af|terwards &s;hould be <HI>previou&s;ly</HI> and <HI>&s;pecially</HI> re&s;erved. This arrangement was calcula|ted to obviate the inconvenience of leaving the proceeds of the loans, for any con&s;ide|rable time unemployed. At the period of making it, and not &s;ooner, the public pro&s;pects appeared to me &s;ufficiently unfolded, to render a general and permanent di&s;po&s;ition free from hazard. This in&s;truction preceded in due &s;ea&s;on all the loans &s;ub&s;equent to that of March 1791.</P>
<P>Whatever delay, therefore may have attended &s;ucceeding inve&s;tments for paying the French debt, is not attributable to this department: And I think it will not ap|pear,
<PB N="11" REF="026347_0010_0FCFB65A552AD2C0">
that any has been incurred, in re&s;pect to the &s;ums which were de&s;tined for the public &s;ervice here. In judging of this point it will be proper to ob&s;erve, that a latitude of &s;ix months, for making their payments, has been re&s;erved to the mo|ney lenders, though with liberty to make them earlier. It was however nece&s;&s;ary for the trea&s;ury to regulate it's bills according to the po&s;&s;ible delay, le&s;t they &s;hould not meet adequate funds. The general policy adopted was to let them fall upon the rear of each loan; this giving a freer cour&s;e for early payments to France, and be&s;t con|ciliating a certainty of funds for an&s;wering the bills, with as little double intere&s;t as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>It will appear, that notwith&s;tanding the arrangement which was made, a con&s;idera|ble time intervened between the two la&s;t payments to France, while there were funds in hand waiting for employment. It may be expected, that the cau&s;es of this procra&s;|tination, though as I have &s;aid not imputable to this department, &s;hould be unfolded to the Hou&s;e. Particular circum&s;tances however induce me to confine my&s;elf to &s;tating generally, that the delay proceeded, in the fir&s;t place, from an expectation given to Mr. Short and kept up from time to time by the French mini&s;ter of marine, that a plan would be adopted, to which a decree of the National A&s;&s;embly was requi&s;ite, for con|verting a large &s;um into &s;upplies for St. Domingo&mdash;which Mr. Short concluded ju&s;tly mu&s;t come out of the foreign fund, and con&s;equently &s;u&s;pended its application in Europe&mdash;In the &s;econd place, from a de&s;ire to &s;ettle, previou&s;ly to further payments, a definitive rule, by which the monies paid, &s;hould be liquidated and credited to the United States.</P>
<P>Both the one and the other appears to have been procra&s;tinated from period to pe|riod, by the di&s;ordered &s;tate of French affairs, and to have finally i&s;&s;ued contrary to expectation. It would be an unnece&s;&s;ary commitment of my opinion to declare, how far the delay appears to me to have been ju&s;tified by the cau&s;es&mdash;But being led by the occa&s;ion to take notice of it, I think it improper to &s;end it abroad, liable per|haps to mi&s;con&s;truction, without ob&s;erving, that the inducements appear to me, to have been weighty&mdash;that the delays naturally grew out of the circum&s;tances, and that I am entirely per&s;uaded of the goodne&s;s of the motives which governed. The corre&s;pondence before the Senate, contains the particulars of the tran&s;action.</P>
<P>Having pointed out the in&s;tances of material delay which happened, and the cau&s;es of them, it remains to &s;tate what circum&s;tances there are to counterbalance the lo&s;s on that account.</P>
<P>The&s;e circum&s;tances are of two kinds.</P>
<P N="1">1. Gain by exchange in the &s;ale of the bills drawn by the trea&s;ury and upon the higher rate of intere&s;t on the credits which were given for tho&s;e bills, than was pay|able on the fund upon which they were drawn.</P>
<P N="2">2. Gain by exchange on the payments to France.</P>
<P>According to my calculation, founded on the be&s;t information extant, the real par of the metals between the United States and Am&s;terdam, makes a current guilder equal to 35 89/100 ninetieths of a dollar. The lowe&s;t rate which has been obtained for the bills has been 36 4/1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> ninetieths, with an allowance of &s;ixty days credit without intere&s;t. Making a deduction for the intere&s;t the bills were &s;till &s;old above the true par. In &s;ome in&s;tances they have been &s;old as high as 40 cents and 7 mills per guil|der, with intere&s;t for the whole term of the credit given.</P>
<P>The rate of intere&s;t for the credits allowed upon the bills was 6 per cent. the mean intere&s;t paid upon the fund 5 per cent. producing con&s;equently a gain of one per cent.</P>
<P>With regard to the payments to France, if the current rate of exchange between Paris and Am&s;terdam at the moment of each remittance or payment were to govern, a large profit would re&s;ult to the United States. But certain equitable con&s;iderations will produce deductions, which will greatly le&s;&s;en this advantage; yet making a li|beral allowance for them, there is ground to calculate that a &s;aving may be made in this particular, more than &s;ufficient to indemnify for the lo&s;s of intere&s;t.</P>
<P>Hence any po&s;itive advantage which will have been otherwi&s;e gained, will probably be undimini&s;hed by that circum&s;tance.</P>
<P>I proceed in the next place, to &s;tate the views which prevailed re&s;pecting the &s;ums that have been from time to time drawn for; the purpo&s;es they have hitherto an&s;wer|ed, and the further advantages to be expected from the mea&s;ure.</P>
<P>The direct object of all the &s;ums drawn for prior to July 1792, was the purcha&s;e of the debt. A collateral con&s;ideration which operated in the fir&s;t &s;tages of drawing, has al&s;o been mentioned. It has likewi&s;e been &s;tated, that the early purcha&s;es of the debt
<PB N="12" REF="026347_0011_0FCFB65C1BE53C40">
are to be a&s;cribed to the in&s;trumentality of the fund derived from the loans. This idea &s;hall now be explained.</P>
<P>Two mi&s;takes appear to have influenced the impre&s;&s;ions which have been entertain|ed in relation, directly or indirectly to this &s;ubject. Fir&s;t, it &s;eems to have been all a|long forgotten, that a con&s;iderable part of the duties is always out&s;tanding, on account of the credits which are given; whence the a&s;&s;ertion, that the &s;inking fund has con|tinually overflowed from dome&s;tic re&s;ources. Second, it &s;eems to have been taken for granted that the proceeds of the loans have remained apart, di&s;tinct from the ma&s;s of the money in the trea&s;ury; while in truth the cour&s;e of the bu&s;ine&s;s has been to turn them over to the Trea&s;urer by warrants as they have been received, &s;o as to form a part of the aggregate, from time to time appearing in his hands and in his accounts. The banks have been the agents employed for &s;elling the bills. Some|times warrants on account have i&s;&s;ued upon them, for the &s;ums accruing from the &s;ales, at other times the warrants have been deferred till the whole proceeds of any parcel have been received and the accounts of the banks &s;ettled at the trea&s;ury; as the &s;tate of the trea&s;ury has happened to render the one or the other mo&s;t convenient.</P>
<P>The banks of North America and New-York, were the agents for the &s;ale of all the bills, which were &s;old prior to April 1792, amounting to 1,006,526 dollars and 36 cents. Of this &s;um 361,391 dollars and 34 cents, were pa&s;&s;ed over to the Trea&s;urer in 1791&mdash;327,136 dollars and 22 cents in March 1792, and 140,000 dollars in June following&mdash;the re&s;idue having remained as heretofore &s;tated, in depo&s;it with the bank of North America upon a &s;pecial con&s;ideration. This is exclu&s;ive of certain bills furni&s;hed for the u&s;e of the department of State, amounting to 78,766 dollars and 67 cents.</P>
<P>The remainder of the bills which have been &s;old beginning in April 1792, were &s;old by the bank of the United States, and its branches at New-York and Baltimore. The accounts of the &s;ales had ju&s;t been made out for &s;ettlement, when the pre&s;ent enquiry began, but warrants had not yet i&s;&s;ued for placing the proceeds in the trea|&s;ury. It will be remarked that from the terms of credit allowed, they only began to be receivable in October la&s;t; the 26th day of which month the fir&s;t return made by the bank, &s;hews a &s;um of 127,225 dollars and 53 cents received; and that the col|lection had not been completed when the accounts of &s;ales were rendered.</P>
<P>There are different views of the &s;ubject which will enable the Hou&s;e to perceive that the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the fund in que&s;tion was nece&s;&s;ary to enable the trea&s;ury to fur|ni&s;h the means of making all the purcha&s;es which were made prior to July, 1792.</P>
<P>It is true, that there was a &s;urplus of revenue to the end of the year 1790, equal to 1,374,656 dollars and 40 cents, which was appropriated to purcha&s;es of the debt; and from the credits then given upon the duties, this &s;urplus would naturally come into the trea&s;ury in the cour&s;e of the year 1791.</P>
<P>But the legi&s;lature fore&s;eeing that the revenue of 1791, from the &s;ame cau&s;e, could not actually be in the trea&s;ury, within that year, to face the appropriations upon it, (which it is to be ob&s;erved were nearly commen&s;urate with the fund) in&s;erted a clau&s;e in the law, appropriating the &s;urplus of 1790, to the purcha&s;e of the debt, which au|thorized a re&s;ervation of &s;o much of that &s;urplus as might be nece&s;&s;ary to make the payments of intere&s;t during 1791; in ca&s;e of a deficiency in the receipts into the trea&s;ury, on account of the current revenue of the year.</P>
<P>It will appear to the Hou&s;e, upon a recurrence to the Trea&s;urer's quarterly account, ending the 30th of September, 1791, that the balance of ca&s;h then on hand was 662,233 dollars and 99 cents.</P>
<P>At that time there had been paid into the trea&s;ury, upon warrants, from the pro|ceeds of the bills drawn upon the foreign fund 361,391 dollars and 34 cents. Con&s;e|quently, the balance of ca&s;h, had it not been for that auxiliary, would have been only 300,842 dollars and 65 cents; con&s;idering the whole balance in the trea&s;ury as repre|&s;enting an equal &s;um of the proceeds of the bills.</P>
<P>Even in a time of complete peace, in a country where a &s;mall extent of monied capital forbids a reliance upon large pecuniary aids to be &s;uddenly obtained&mdash;a pru|dent admini&s;trator of the finances could not feel entirely at ea&s;e, with a le&s;s &s;um at all times in the certain command of the trea&s;ury, than 500,000 dollars, for meeting current demands and extra exigencies, which in the affairs of a nation are every mo|ment to be expected. But with a war actually on hand, and a po&s;&s;ibility of its exten|&s;ion to a more &s;erious length, he would be inexcu&s;able, in leaving him&s;elf with a le&s;s
<PB N="13" REF="026347_0012_0FCFB65E335D23B0">
&s;um at command; unle&s;s from an impracticability of doing otherwi&s;e. It would be always his duty to combine two con&s;iderations&mdash;the chance of extra calls for money, and a po&s;&s;ibility of &s;ome failure in the receipts which were expected. Derangements of various kinds may happen in the commercial circle, capable of interrupting for a time the punctual cour&s;e of payments to the trea&s;ury. It is nece&s;&s;ary to a certain ex|tent to be prepared for &s;uch ca&s;ualties.</P>
<P>But during the year 1791, there was a circum&s;tance, which operated as an addi|tional rea&s;on for keeping a re&s;pectable &s;um always on hand. The loans of the dome&s;tic debt were going on till the la&s;t of September of that year; while at the &s;ame time, the intere&s;t was in a cour&s;e of payment&mdash;It was therefore always uncertain what &s;um would be payable at the end of a quarter; this depending on the eagerne&s;s or backward|ne&s;s of the public creditors in bringing forward their &s;ub&s;criptions, or their claims as non-&s;ub&s;cribers. The omi&s;&s;ions, at the end of a preceding quarter, might be expected to fall upon a &s;ub&s;equent one&mdash;and it was nece&s;&s;ary to be prepared for that po&s;&s;ibility; of cour&s;e to keep in hand a large fund for contingent demands. This nece&s;&s;ity ex|tended to the termination of the period for receiving &s;ub&s;criptions; becau&s;e the trea&s;ury was to be prepared on the &s;uppo&s;ition, that the whole of the dome&s;tic debt would then be in a &s;tate to receive intere&s;t either as <HI>&s;ub&s;cribed</HI> or <HI>un&s;ub&s;cribed.</HI> But this did not in fact happen&mdash;A part of the &s;ums which were pre&s;ented were crouded into the la&s;t days of the quarter and were too late for a dividend. A con&s;iderable &s;um remained ultimately in a form, which according to the terms of the provi&s;ion did not intitle it to intere&s;t, either as <HI>&s;ub&s;cribed</HI> or as <HI>un&s;ub&s;cribed</HI> debt.</P>
<P>Hence the ca&s;h in the trea&s;ury on the 1&s;t of October 1791, was by a con&s;iderable &s;um greater than was to have been counted upon or than might have happened.</P>
<P>The conclu&s;ion which re&s;ults from the foregoing ob&s;ervations is this&mdash;that the purcha&s;es which preceded the 1&s;t of October 1791, and which amounted to 699,984 dollars and 23 cents in &s;pecie could not have been hazarded, but for the aid of the &s;ums which had actually accrued from the proceeds of the bills and the expectation of tho&s;e which were to accrue from the yet uncollected proceeds of others.</P>
<P>Had it not been for this aid, the trea&s;ury would have been left more bare, than was con&s;i&s;tent with the &s;ecurity of public credit and the certain execution of the public &s;ervice.</P>
<P>There is however a later period in the &s;tate of the trea&s;ury, which will more com|pletely illu&s;trate the idea intended to be e&s;tabli&s;hed. This is the 2d of July, 1792.</P>
<P>On that day, the balance of ca&s;h in the trea&s;ury, comprehending the depo&s;its in all the banks, and including a &s;um of 200,000 dollars, received on loan of the bank of the United States, together with a &s;um of 220,900 dollars in bills drawn upon dome&s;|tic funds, the proceeds of which had not been received, was 623,133 dollars and 61 cents.</P>
<P>Prior to this period a further &s;um of 545,902 dollars and 89 cents ari&s;ing from the &s;ales of foreign bills had been placed in the trea&s;ury, by warrants, making with the former &s;ums placed there from the &s;ame &s;ource, 907,294 dollars and 23 cents.</P>
<P>Had it not been for this auxiliary, and that of the loan from the bank, the trea&s;ury would then have been in arrear 484,160 dollars and 62 cents. It therefore nece&s;&s;arily follows, that for the purcha&s;es to that period, which amounted in &s;pecie to 942,672 dollars and 54 cents, at lea&s;t 484,160 dollars and 62 cents mu&s;t have come from the foreign fund.</P>
<P>But when it is con&s;idered, for the rea&s;ons which have been &s;tated, and which will hereafter be fortified by others, tending as I conceive, to give them conclu&s;ive force, that the &s;um in the trea&s;ury at the period in que&s;tion was barely what ought to have been there for &s;afety, and for a due &s;upply to current demands&mdash;it will follow that the whole or nearly the whole of the purcha&s;es which were made previous to July 1792, were made by the means or in&s;trumentality of the foreign fund.</P>
<P>A &s;imilar view, extended to the &s;ub&s;equent quarter, will exhibit this point in a &s;till clearer light. The balance then in the trea&s;ury, including a further loan from the bank of 100,000 dollars, was only 420,914 dollars and 51 cents.</P>
<P>What then it may be a&s;ked became of the &s;urplus of revenue to the end of 1790? what was the office performed by that fund during the period in que&s;tion?</P>
<P>The an&s;wer is, that it &s;erved exactly the purpo&s;e which was anticipated by the le|gi&s;lature. It came in aid of the current receipt for &s;atisfying the current expenditure
<PB N="14" REF="026347_0013_0FCFB65FEF4E1F68">
of 1791, with particular reference to the intere&s;t of the debt. This will ea&s;ily be compre|hended when it is recollected that the appropriations made during 1791, upon the reve|nues of that year, and &s;ome &s;mall &s;urplu&s;&s;es of antecedent appropriations, amounted to three million &s;ix hundred and thirty-&s;even thou&s;and and fifty-eight dollars and thirty-four cents; that the revenues them&s;elves amounted to no more than three million five hundred and fifty-three thou&s;and, one hundred and ninety-five dollars and eigh|teen cents; and that at the end of 1791, there were out&s;tanding in bonds for the du|ties on imports, be&s;ides the chief part of the proceeds of the duties on &s;pirits di&s;tilled within the United States, then al&s;o uncollected, 1,828,269 dollars and 28 cents.</P>
<P>On this point likewi&s;e, of the &s;urplus of revenue to the end of 1790, it is pre&s;ume|able a mi&s;apprehen&s;ion has been entertained. It &s;eems to have been &s;uppo&s;ed, that that &s;urplus, as well as the proceeds of the foreign fund, have been kept &s;eparate and di&s;tinct from the common ma&s;s of the monies appearing from time to time to be in the trea&s;ury. It has been already ob&s;erved, that this was not the ca&s;e with regard to the foreign fund. It is now proper to add, that it has not been the ca&s;e, either, with re|gard to the &s;urplus in que&s;tion. That &s;urplus, as received by the collectors of the cu&s;|toms, has regularly pa&s;&s;ed into the trea&s;ury, and appears in the quarterly accounts of the trea&s;urer for the periods to which they relate.</P>
<P>It is the cour&s;e of the trea&s;ury, re&s;ulting from the con&s;titution of the department, for all monies from whatever &s;ource, to be brought into it, to con&s;titute an aggre|gate; &s;ubject to the di&s;po&s;itions pre&s;cribed by law. The monies to be employed in the &s;inking fund, have con&s;equently only been &s;eparated, as they have been called for, <HI>for actual inve&s;tment.</HI> The only exception to this, relates to that part of the &s;inking fund, which is created by the intere&s;t of the debt purcha&s;ed. This has been included in the quarterly dividends, and covered by the warrants, in favour of the ca&s;hiers of the banks for paying tho&s;e dividends, after which, they have pa&s;&s;ed into a di&s;tinct account, in the books of the bank opened with Samuel Meredith, as agent to the commi&s;&s;ioners of the &s;inking fund.</P>
<P>To the foregoing repre&s;entation, it may &s;eem an objection that the purcha&s;es to the end of 1791, appear to have been carried to the account of the &s;urplus at the end of 1790.</P>
<P>The ultimate form which it has been judged convenient to give to the tran&s;action in the accounts of the trea&s;ury, cannot change what was truly the cour&s;e of facts. The proceeds of the above-mentioned &s;urplus and of the foreign loans formed toge|ther the fund for purcha&s;es. In the accounts of the trea&s;ury, the thing was &s;u&s;ceptible of various modifications at plea&s;ure. The two parts of the fund might have been united in one account, or divided into di&s;tinct accounts. Being &s;eparated, monies i&s;&s;ued for purcha&s;es might have been legally carried to either of them.</P>
<P>It was judged mo&s;t advi&s;eable, in the forms of the trea&s;ury, to place the purcha&s;es to the end of 1791, to the account of the dome&s;tic fund, becau&s;e it was calculated to give greater latitude and energy to the &s;inking fund. Had not this cour&s;e been pur&s;ued, the bu&s;ine&s;s would have taken the following &s;hape&mdash;the foreign fund to the extent of the purcha&s;es, would have been exhau&s;ted&mdash;the whole, or the greater part of the &s;urplus of 1790, would have continued wrapt up in the expenditure of 1791, not liable to be liberated, till the <HI>receipts</HI> into the trea&s;ury &s;hould yield a corre&s;pondent &s;urplus beyond the <HI>actual di&s;bur&s;ements</HI>&mdash;which could not have been the ca&s;e, while the war with the Indians continues to call for extraordinary expenditures.</P>
<P>From the form into which the thing has been thrown, the foreign fund has been &s;et free to be applied to further purcha&s;es; and a nece&s;&s;ity produced of anticipating the out&s;tanding duties, by temporary loans for the current &s;ervice.</P>
<P>I tru&s;t there can be no doubt, that the cour&s;e pur&s;ued was regular, and within the di&s;cretion of the department. I hope al&s;o, that it will appear to the hou&s;e to have been the mo&s;t eligible. The expediency of giving the earlie&s;t and greate&s;t po&s;&s;ible extent and activity to whatever concerns the &s;inking fund, will, it is pre&s;umed, unite all opinions.</P>
<P>What has been &s;aid hitherto re&s;pecting the employment of the foreign funds is ap|plicable only to that part of it which was drawn for prior to April 1792; the re&s;idue &s;tanding in a different &s;ituation and requiring a &s;eparate examination.</P>
<P>From the &s;tatement which has been given, it may be perceived that the fund in que&s;tion has neither been idle nor u&s;ele&s;s. A confirmation of this will be found in the following details.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="026347_0014_0FCF8F14B04F7268">
The whole &s;um &s;ucce&s;&s;ively received on account of Am&s;terdam bills up to the 17th of Augu&s;t 1791, was 361,391 dollars and 34 cents. The amount of the monies in|ve&s;ted in purcha&s;es prior to that day was 350,000 dollars, chiefly by anticipation of tho&s;e receipts.</P>
<P>The whole &s;um &s;ucce&s;&s;ively received on account of Am&s;terdam bills from Augu&s;t 17, 1791, to March 1, 1792, was 408,722 dollars and 69 cents. The amount of the monies inve&s;ted in purcha&s;es between tho&s;e periods, was 349,984 dollars and 23 cents, chiefly in the month of September, and by anticipation of tho&s;e receipts.</P>
<P>The whole &s;um &s;ucce&s;&s;ively received on account of Am&s;terdam bills, &s;ub&s;equent to the 1&s;t of March, and prior to July, 1792, was 235,412 dollars and 33 cents. The amount of the monies inve&s;ted in purcha&s;es between tho&s;e periods, was 242,688 dollars and 31 cents.</P>
<P>It was &s;tated in my fir&s;t letter, that 177,998 dollars and 80 cents, of the proceeds of the foreign bills were left in depo&s;it with the bank of North America; and in a note upon &s;tatement B accompanying that letter, the occa&s;ion of it was &s;hewn to be an advance without intere&s;t, made by that bank, for the u&s;e of the department of war; which could not yet be covered in con&s;equence of a doubt &s;till remaining, whether the fund appropriated for &s;atisfying that object, was adequate to it, the &s;ufficiency of that fund depending in part on certain unexpended re&s;idues of antecedent appropria|tions, which it was expected would not be finally nece&s;&s;ary for &s;atisfying the purpo&s;es of tho&s;e appropriations.</P>
<P>It is to be remarked that the delay of the employment of this part of the proceeds of the foreign fund, has been compen&s;ated by a &s;aving of intere&s;t on the &s;um advanced by the bank, which otherwi&s;e mu&s;t have been procured upon a loan with an allow|ance of intere&s;t, probably at the time of the advance, at a rate of 6 per cent. &s;o that even in this particular, the fund, though temporarily &s;u&s;pended from its de&s;tinati|on, has not been idle or unproductive. I re&s;erve for another place &s;ome additional ob&s;ervations and &s;tatements, which will be calculated to &s;hew, that opportunities of inve&s;ting the monies at any time on hand applicable to purcha&s;es of the debt, were not &s;uffered to pa&s;s unimproved, and that as much in this re&s;pect was done as the &s;tate of the trea&s;ury and the &s;tate of the market would permit.</P>
<P>It has been &s;aid, that a di&s;tinct examination would be proper with regard to the bills which have been drawn upon the foreign fund, &s;ub&s;equent to March, 1792. I proceed now to this examination.</P>
<P>The expediency of what has been, in this re&s;pect, done, &s;eems to have been called in que&s;tion, under a &s;ugge&s;tion that an application of the fund to purcha&s;es had cea&s;ed to be advantageous.</P>
<P>The drawing of the&s;e bills has been at different periods influenced by various con&s;i|derations. A leading motive was always the purcha&s;e of the debt. And a correct view of the &s;ubject will, I doubt not, &s;atisfy the Hou&s;e, that the mea&s;ure was recom|mended by an adequate pro&s;pect of advantage.</P>
<P>It is to be ob&s;erved that all the&s;e drafts were predicated upon the two four per cent. loans; being as already &s;tated real 4&frac12; per cent loans.</P>
<P>There was good ground to pre&s;ume, that opportunities would be found of inve&s;ting the monies drawn for in purcha&s;es which would yield at lea&s;t 5 per cent. with a po&s;&s;i|bility of doing &s;till better. The difference of &frac12; per cent. was alone an object of im|portance; but it would be coupled with the further benefit of reducing a principal &s;um materially exceeding the &s;um inve&s;ted. When the three per cents are purcha&s;ed at 12s. in the pound, there is not only a redemption of an annuity of 5 per cent. but a &s;inking of a capital of 20s. for 12. And though this might not be material, if the market rate of intere&s;t &s;hould never fall below 5, becau&s;e in that ca&s;e the three per cents might always be purcha&s;ed at the &s;ame rate; yet if it &s;hould at any time happen, that intere&s;t fell below five, it would be a gain to the government to have purcha&s;ed at 5, in exact proportion to the difference between 5 and the then market rate. Add to this, that the price of 3 per cents have generally a value in the market more than proportioned to the income they produce, which ari&s;es from the capacity of the capi|tal to appreciate even to par. The&s;e ob&s;ervations are al&s;o for the mo&s;t part applicable to the deferred, with this circum&s;tance in addition, that when intere&s;t begins to be payable on that &s;pecies of &s;tock, the money inve&s;ted and which in the mean time would have produced five, would then begin to produce to the government 6 per cent. with the advantage of having anticipated the redemption of a &s;pecies of &s;tock of
<PB N="16" REF="026347_0015_0FCFB66437D993B0">
right only gradually redeemable. Combining the&s;e con&s;iderations, it appears to be clearly and even eminently for the intere&s;t of the government to purcha&s;e within the limit &s;ugge&s;ted, with a fund which does not co&s;t more than 4&frac12; per cent.</P>
<P>That this was the view of the &s;ubject which governed, is deducible not only from the circum&s;tances of the fact, but from my letter of the 2d of April, 1792, to Mr. Short, announcing my intention to draw, in which I a&s;&s;ign as the ground of that in|tention, "that I con&s;idered it for the intere&s;t of the United States to pro&s;ecute pur|cha&s;es of the public debt with monies borrowed on the terms of the la&s;t loan," mean|ing the loan of the 1&s;t of January 1792, at 4 per cent.</P>
<P>If the event be taken as a criterion, the anticipation will be more than ju&s;tified, the pre&s;ent juncture offering an opportunity for purcha&s;es peculiarly advantageous.</P>
<P>But without in&s;i&s;ting on a &s;tate of things occa&s;ioned by extraordinary circum&s;tan|ces, it was morally certain, that the common cour&s;e of events would render the operation a beneficial one. And it would not argue peculiar fore&s;ight, if a calculation was even made on the effect, which the &s;ituation and probable progre&s;s of affairs in Europe might produce upon our market. A pretty general war there, by extending the demand for money would naturally divert from our &s;tocks a portion of what might otherwi&s;e be employed upon them and affect injuriou&s;ly their prices. It is al|&s;o a familiar fact, that during the winter in this country, there is always a &s;carcity of money in the towns; a circum&s;tance calculated to damp the prices of &s;tock.</P>
<P>A con&s;ideration, which collaterally influenced the drawing of the latter bills was the &s;ituation of the French colony of St. Domingo.</P>
<P>This not only produced an early application for a con&s;iderable advance, which was promi&s;ed; but it was to be fore&s;een, that &s;till further aids would be indi&s;pen&s;able.</P>
<P>Indeed &s;undry letters from Mr. Short, the fir&s;t dated at Paris, the 28th December 1791, announced the daily probability of an arrangement, requiring an advance here of 800,000 dollars for the u&s;e of that colony. A &s;um of 4,000,000 of livres has in fact been &s;ucce&s;&s;ively &s;tipulated for that object, the greate&s;t part of which has been ac|tually furni&s;hed.</P>
<P>It is known, that the&s;e &s;upplies could proceed from no other &s;ource than the fo|reign fund.</P>
<P>The payment to the foreign officers of near 200,000 dollars, by which an intere&s;t of 6 per cent. would be relea&s;ed, was another object for which provi&s;ion was to be made out of the &s;ame fund.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;everal purpo&s;es con&s;pired with the object of purcha&s;ing the debt to induce the latitude of drawing, which took place.</P>
<P>But there was &s;till a further inducement which came in aid of the others. The time for reimbur&s;ing the fir&s;t in&s;talment of the two millions of dollars due to the bank was approaching, when by po&s;itive &s;tipulation, the government would have to pay two hundred thou&s;and dollars, for which there was no dome&s;tic fund, that could be &s;pared from the current exigencies. I thought it incumbent upon this department to have an eye to placing within the reach of the legi&s;lature the means of fulfilling this engagement; the object of which bore a &s;trict analogy to that for which the two mil|lions authorized by the act making provi&s;ion for the reduction of the public debt were to be borrowed.</P>
<P>I did not even &s;cruple to take into the calculation, that if from the extent of the draughts upon the foreign fund, there &s;hould happen to be found on hand a larger &s;um than was nece&s;&s;ary for, or could be advantageou&s;ly employed towards, the &s;eve|ral purpo&s;es which were the immediate and direct objects of the operation, the &s;ur|plus would facilitate to the government a mea&s;ure manife&s;tly and unequivocally bene|ficial&mdash;an additional payment to the bank, on account of a debt, upon which an an|nual intere&s;t of 6 per cent. was payable; a mea&s;ure by which a certain &s;aving of one per cent. to the extent of the payment that might be made would be accompli&s;hed.</P>
<P>The po&s;&s;ibility of this application of the fund afforded a perfect a&s;&s;urance, that the public intere&s;t could in no event fail to be promoted.</P>
<P>I felt my&s;elf the more at liberty to do it, becau&s;e it did not interfere with a complete fulfilment of the public engagements in regard to the foreign debt. It could be done con&s;i&s;tently with a full reimbur&s;ement of all arrears and in&s;talments which had accrued on account of that debt.</P>

<P>The previous &s;ickne&s;s and afterwards the death of Mr. Eveleigh, the late Comp|troller, which happened on the 15th of April 1791, occa&s;ioned an accommodation between the Secretary of the Trea&s;ury and the bank of North-America, with re&s;pect to a number of warrants which were not counter&s;igned, the bank agreeing to pay them and retain them in its po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion till the appointment of a Comptroller, when they could be regularly counter&s;igned and charged to my account. This cau&s;ed an agreement with the Comptroller that the two fir&s;t quarters of the year 1791, might be included in one account, in order that the different offices in the Trea&s;ury Department &s;hould corre&s;pond in their balances.</P>
