<HEAD>AND HE THEREUPON RESPECTFULLY SUBMITS THE FOLLOWING</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>REPORT.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE expediency of encouraging manufactures in the United States, which was not long &s;ince deemed very que&s;tionable, appears at this time to be pretty generally admitted. The embarra&s;&s;ments which have ob&s;tructed the progre&s;s of our external trade, have led to &s;erious reflections on the nece&s;&s;ity of enlarging the &s;phere of our dome&s;tic commerce: the re&s;trictive regulations, which in foreign markets abridge the vent of the encrea&s;ing &s;urplus of our agricultural produce, &s;erve to beget an earne&s;t de&s;ire, that a more exten&s;ive demand for that &s;urplus may be created at home: And the complete &s;ucce&s;s which has rewarded manufacturing enterpri&s;e, in &s;ome valuable branches, con&s;piring with the promi&s;ing &s;ymptoms which attend &s;ome le&s;s mature e&s;&s;ays in others, ju&s;tify a hope, that the ob&s;tacles to the growth of this &s;pecies of indu&s;try are le&s;s formidable than they were apprehended to be; and that it is not difficult to find, in its further exten&s;ion, a full indemnification for any external di&s;advantages, which are or may be experienced, as well as an ac|ce&s;&s;ion of re&s;ources, favorable to national independence and &s;afety.</P>
<P>There &s;till are, neverthele&s;s, re&s;pectable patrons of opinions, unfriendly to the encouragement of manufactures.&mdash;The following are, &s;ub&s;tantially, the arguments by which the&s;e opinions are defended:</P>
<P>"In every country (&s;ay tho&s;e who entertain them) agriculture is the mo&s;t beneficial and <HI>productive</HI> object of human indu&s;try. This po&s;ition, generally, if not univer&s;ally true, applies with peculiar empha&s;is to the United States, on account of their immen&s;e tracts of fertile territory, uninhabited and un|improved. Nothing can afford &s;o advantageous an employment for capital and labor, as the conver&s;ion of this exten&s;ive wilderne&s;s into cultivated farms. Nothing equally with this, can contribute to the population, &s;trength and real riches of the country."</P>
<P>"To endeavor, by the extraordinary patronage of government, to acce|lerate the growth of manufactures, is, in fact, to endeavor, by force and art, to transfer the natural current of indu&s;try, from a more to a le&s;s beneficial channel. Whatever has &s;uch a tendency mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be unwi&s;e: Indeed it can hardly ever be wi&s;e in a government, to attempt to give a direction to the indu&s;try of its citizens. This, under the quick-&s;ighted guidance of private intere&s;t, will, if left to it&s;elf, infallibly find its own way to the mo&s;t profitable employment; and it is by &s;uch employment, that the public pro&s;perity will be mo&s;t effectually promoted. To leave indu&s;try to it&s;elf, therefore, is, in almo&s;t every ca&s;e, the &s;ounde&s;t as well as the &s;imple&s;t policy."</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="023914_0004_0FC2856F1B8C2790">
"This policy is not only recommended to the United States, by con&s;iderations which affect all nations; it is, in a manner, dictated to them by the imperious force of a very peculiar &s;ituation. The &s;mallne&s;s of their population, com|pared with their territory, the con&s;tant allurements to emigration from the &s;ettled to the un&s;ettled parts of the country; the facility with which the le&s;s independent condition of an arti&s;an can be exchanged for the more independent condition of a farmer; the&s;e, and &s;imilar cau&s;es, con&s;pire to produce, and for a length of time mu&s;t continue to occa&s;ion, a &s;carcity of hands for manufac|turing occupation, and dearne&s;s of labor generally. To the&s;e di&s;advan|tages for the pro&s;ecution of manufactures, a deficiency of pecuniary capital being added, the pro&s;pect of a &s;ucce&s;sful competition with the manufacturers of Europe, mu&s;t be regarded as little le&s;s than de&s;perate. Exten&s;ive manu|factures can only be the offspring of a redundant, at lea&s;t of a full population. Till the latter &s;hall characteri&s;e the &s;ituation of this country, 'tis vain to hope for the former."</P>
<P>"If, contrary to the natural cour&s;e of things, an un&s;ea&s;onble and prema|ture &s;pring can be given to certain fabrics, by heavy duties, prohibitions, bounties, or by other forced expedients; this will only be to &s;acrifice the in|tere&s;ts of the community to tho&s;e of particular cla&s;&s;es. Be&s;ides the mi&s;direc|tion of labor, a virtual monopoly will be given to the per&s;ons employed on &s;uch fabrics; and an enhancement of price, the inevitable con&s;equence of every monopoly, mu&s;t be defrayed at the expence of the other parts of the &s;ociety. It is far preferable, that tho&s;e per&s;ons &s;hould be engaged in the cul|tivation of the earth, and that we &s;hould procure, in exchange for its produc|tions, the commodities, with which foreigners are able to &s;upply us in greater perfection, and upon better terms."</P>
<P>This mode of rea&s;oning is founded upon facts and principles, which have certainly re&s;pectable preten&s;ions. If it had governed the conduct of nations, more generally than it has done, there is room to &s;uppo&s;e, that it might have carried them fa&s;ter to pro&s;perity and greatne&s;s, than they have attained by the pur&s;uit of maxims too widely oppo&s;ite. Mo&s;t general theories, however, admit of numerous exceptions, and there are few, if any, of the political kind, which do not blend a con&s;iderable portion of error with the truths they in|culcate.</P>
<P>In order to an accurate judgment how far that which has been ju&s;t &s;tated ought to be deemed liable to a &s;imilar imputation, it is nece&s;&s;ary to advert carefully to the con&s;iderations which plead in favour of manufactures, and which appear to recommend the &s;pecial and po&s;itive encouragement of them, in certain ca&s;es, and under certain rea&s;onable limitations.</P>
<P>It ought readily to be conceded, that the cultivation of the earth, as the primary and mo&s;t certain &s;ource of national &s;upply; as the immediate and chief &s;ource of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence to man; as the principal &s;ource of tho&s;e materials which con&s;titute the nutriment of other kinds of labor; as including a &s;tate mo&s;t favourable to the freedom and independence of the human mind; one, perhaps, mo&s;t conducive to the multiplication of the human &s;pecies; has <HI>intrin&s;ically a &s;trong claim to pre-eminence over every other kind of indu&s;try.</HI></P>
<P>But, that it has a title to any thing like an exclu&s;ive predilection, in any country, ought to be admitted with great caution. That it is even more productive than every other branch of indu&s;try, requires more evidence than
<PB N="3" REF="023914_0005_0FC2857292779D88">
has yet been given in &s;upport of the po&s;ition. That its real intere&s;ts, preci|ous and important as, without the help of exaggeration, they truly are, will be advanced, rather than injured by the due encouragement of manufactures, may, it is believed, be &s;atisfactorily demon&s;trated. And it is al&s;o believed, that the expediency of &s;uch encouragement, in a general view, may be &s;hewn to be recommended by the mo&s;t cogent and per&s;ua&s;ive motives of national policy.</P>
<P>It has been maintained, that agriculture is, not only, the mo&s;t productive, but the only productive &s;pecies of indu&s;try. The reality of this &s;ugge&s;tion, in either re&s;pect, has, however, not been verified by any accurate detail of facts and calculations; and the general arguments, which are adduced to prove it, are rather &s;ubtil and paradoxical, than &s;olid or convincing.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e which maintain its exclu&s;ive productivene&s;s are to this effect:&mdash;</P>
<P>Labor, be&s;towed upon the cultivation of land, produces enough, not only to replace all the nece&s;&s;ary expences incurred in the bu&s;ine&s;s, and to maintain the per&s;ons who are employed in it, but to afford, together with the <HI>ordinary profit</HI> on the &s;tock or capital of the farmer, a nett &s;urplus, or <HI>rent</HI> for the landlord or proprietor of the &s;oil. But the labor of artificers does nothing more than replace the &s;tock which employs them (or which furni&s;hes materi|als, tools and wages) and yield the <HI>ordinary profit</HI> upon that &s;tock. It yields nothing equivalent to the <HI>rent</HI> of land. Neither does it add any thing to the <HI>total value</HI> of the <HI>whole annual produce</HI> of the land and labor of the country. The additional value given to tho&s;e parts of the produce of land, which are wrought into manufactures, is counterbalanced by the value of tho&s;e other parts of that produce, which are con&s;umed by the manufacturers. It can therefore only be by &s;aving or <HI>par&s;imony,</HI> not by the po&s;itive <HI>productivene&s;s</HI> of their labor, that the cla&s;&s;es of artificers can in any degree augment the reve|nue of the &s;ociety.</P>
<P>To this it has been an&s;wered,</P>
<P N="1">1. "That ina&s;much as it is acknowledged, that manufacturing labor re|produces a value equal to that which is expended or con&s;umed in carrying it on, and continues in exi&s;tence the original &s;tock or capital employed, it ought on that account alone, to e&s;cape being con&s;idered as wholly unproductive: That though it &s;hould be admitted, as alledged, that the con&s;umption of the pro|duce of the &s;oil, by the cla&s;&s;es of artificers or manufacturers, is exactly equal to the value added by their labor to the materials upon which it is exerted; yet it would not thence follow, that it added nothing to the revenue of the &s;ociety, or to the aggregate value of the annual produce of its land and labor. If the con&s;umption for any given period amounted to a <HI>given &s;um,</HI> and the <HI>increa&s;ed</HI> value of the produce manufactured, in the &s;ame period, to a <HI>like &s;um,</HI> the total amount of the con&s;umption and production during that period, would be equal to the <HI>two &s;ums,</HI> and con&s;equently double the value of the agricultural produce con&s;umed. And though the increment of value produced by the cla&s;&s;es of artificers &s;hould at no time exceed the value of the produce of the land con&s;umed by them, yet there would be at every moment, in con&s;equence of their labor, a greater value of goods in the market than would exi&s;t inde|pendent of it."</P>
<P N="2">2. "That the po&s;ition, that artificers can augment the revenue of a &s;ocie|ty, only by par&s;imony, is true in no other &s;en&s;e, than in one which is equally
<PB N="4" REF="023914_0006_0FC285744A437100">
applicable to hu&s;bandmen or cultivators. It may be alike affirmed of all the&s;e cla&s;&s;es, that the fund acquired by their labor and de&s;tined for their &s;up|port, is not, in an ordinary way, more than equal to it. And hence it will follow, that augmentations of the wealth or capital of the community (except in the in&s;tances of &s;ome extraordinary dexterity or &s;kill) can only proceed, with re&s;pect to any of them, from the &s;avings of the more thrifty and par&s;i|monious."</P>
<P N="3">3. "That the annual produce of the land and labor of a country can only be encrea&s;ed, in two ways&mdash;by &s;ome improvement in the <HI>productive powers</HI> of the u&s;eful labor, which actually exi&s;ts within it, or by &s;ome encrea&s;e in the quantity of &s;uch labor: That with regard to the fir&s;t, the labor of artificers being capable of greater &s;ubdivi&s;ion and &s;implicity of operation, than that of cultivators, it is &s;u&s;ceptible, in a proportionably greater degree, of improvement in its <HI>productive powers,</HI> whether to be derived from an acce&s;&s;ion of &s;kill, or from the application of ingenious machinery; in which particular, therefore, the labor employed in the culture of land can pretend to no advantage over that engaged in manufactures: That with regard to an augmentation of the quantity of u&s;eful labor, this, excluding adven<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters">us circum&s;tances, mu&s;t de|pend e&s;&s;entially upon an encrea&s;e of <HI>capital,</HI> which again mu&s;t depend upon the &s;avings made out of the revenues of tho&s;e, who furni&s;h or manage <HI>that,</HI> which is at any time employed, whether in agriculture, or in manufactures, or in any other way."</P>
<P>But while the <HI>exclu&s;ive</HI> productivene&s;s of agricultural labor has been thus denied and refuted, the &s;uperiority of its productivene&s;s has been conceded without he&s;itation. As this conce&s;&s;ion involves a point of con&s;iderable magni|tude, in relation to maxims of public admini&s;tration, the grounds on which it re&s;ts are worthy of a di&s;tinct and particular examination.</P>
<P>One of the arguments made u&s;e of, in &s;upport of the idea may be pronoun|ced both quaint and &s;uperficial: It amounts to this&mdash;That in the productions of the &s;oil, nature co-operates with man; and that the effect of their joint la|bor mu&s;t be greater than that of the labor of man alone.</P>
<P>This, however, is far from being a nece&s;&s;ary inference. It is very conceiv|able, that the labor of man alone laid out upon a work, requiring great &s;kill and art to bring it to perfection, may be more productive, <HI>in value,</HI> than the labor of nature and man combined, when directed towards more &s;imple ope|rations and objects: And when it is recollected to what an extent the agency of nature, in the application of the mechanical powers, is made auxiliary to the pro&s;ecution of manufactures, the &s;ugge&s;tion which has been noticed, lo&s;es even the appearance of plau&s;ibility.</P>
<P>It might al&s;o be ob&s;erved, with a contrary view, that the labor employed in agriculture is in a great mea&s;ure periodical and occa&s;ional, depending on &s;ea&s;ons, liable to various and long intermi&s;&s;ions; while that occupied in many manufactures is con&s;tant and regular, extending through the year, embracing, in &s;ome in&s;tances, night as well as day. It is al&s;o probable, that there are among the cultivators of land, more examples of remi&s;&s;ne&s;s, than among artificers. The farmer, from the peculiar fertility of his land, or &s;ome other favorable circum&s;tance, may frequently obtain a livelihood, even with a con&s;iderable degree of carele&s;&s;ne&s;s in the mode of cultivation; but the arti&s;an can with difficulty effect the &s;ame object, without exerting him&s;elf pretty e|qually with all tho&s;e, who are engaged in the &s;ame pur&s;uit. And if it may
<PB N="5" REF="023914_0007_0FC28577623AF468">
likewi&s;e be a&s;&s;umed as a fact, that manufactures open a wider field to exerti|ons of ingenuity than agriculture, it would not be a &s;trained conjecture, that the labor employed in the former, being at once more <HI>con&s;tant,</HI> more uniform and more ingenious, than that which is employed in the latter, will be found at the &s;ame time more productive.</P>
<P>But it is not meant to lay &s;tre&s;s on ob&s;ervations of this nature; they ought only to &s;erve as a counterbalance to tho&s;e of a &s;imilar complexion. Circum|&s;tances &s;o vague and general, as well as &s;o ab&s;tract, can afford little in&s;truction in a matter of this kind.</P>
<P>Another, and that which &s;eems to be the principal argument offered for the &s;uperior productivene&s;s of agricultural labor, turns upon the allegation, that la|bor employed on manufactures yields nothing equivalent to the rent of land; or to that nett &s;urplus, as it is called, which accrues to the proprietor of the &s;oil.</P>
<P>But this di&s;tinction, important as it has been deemed, appears rather <HI>verbal</HI> than <HI>&s;ub&s;tantial.</HI></P>
<P>It is ea&s;ily di&s;cernible, that what in the fir&s;t in&s;tance is divided into two parts under the denominations of the <HI>ordinary profit</HI> of the &s;tock of the farmer and <HI>rent</HI> to the landlord, is in the &s;econd in&s;tance united under the general appellation of the <HI>ordinary profit</HI> on the &s;tock of the undertaker; and that this formal or verbal di&s;tribution con&s;titutes the whole difference in the two ca&s;es. It &s;eems to have been overlooked, that the land is it&s;elf a &s;tock or capital, ad|vanced or lent by its owner to the occupier or tenant, and that the rent he re|ceives is only the ordinary profit of a certain &s;tock in land, not managed by the proprietor him&s;elf, but by another to whom he lends or lets it, and who, on his part, advances a &s;econd capital to &s;tock and improve the land, upon which he al&s;o receives the u&s;ual profit. The rent of the landlord and the pro|fit of the farmer are therefore nothing more than the <HI>ordinary profits</HI> of <HI>two</HI> capitals belonging to <HI>two</HI> different per&s;ons, and united in the cultivation of a farm: As in the other ca&s;e, the &s;urplus which ari&s;es upon any manufactory, after replacing the expences of carrying it on, an&s;wers to the ordinary profits of <HI>one</HI> or <HI>more</HI> capitals engaged in the pro&s;ecution of &s;uch manufactory. It is &s;aid <HI>one</HI> or <HI>more</HI> capitals; becau&s;e in fact, the &s;ame thing which is contemplated in the ca&s;e of the farm, &s;ometimes happens in that of a manufactory. There is one, who furni&s;hes a part of the capital, or lends a part of the money, by which it is carried on, and another, who carries it on, with the addition of his own capital. Out of the &s;urplus which remains, after defraying expences, an intere&s;t is paid to the money lender for the portion of the capital furni&s;hed by him, which exactly agrees with the rent paid to the landlord; and the re&s;idue of that &s;urplus con&s;titutes the profit of the undertaker or manufacturer, and agrees with what is denominated the ordinary profits on the &s;tock of the farm|er. Both together make the ordinary profits of two capitals employed in a manufactory; as in the other ca&s;e the rent of the landlord and the revenue of the farmer compo&s;e the ordinary profits of two capitals, employed in the cul|tivation of a farm.</P>
<P>The rent therefore accruing to the proprietor of the land, far from being a criterion of <HI>exclu&s;ive</HI> productivene&s;s, as has been argued, is no criterion even of &s;uperior productivene&s;s. The que&s;tion mu&s;t &s;till be, whether the &s;urplus, after defraying expences, of a <HI>given capital,</HI> employed in the <HI>purcha&s;e</HI> and <HI>im|provement</HI> of a piece of land, is greater or le&s;s, than that of a like capital em|ployed
<PB N="6" REF="023914_0008_0FC2857DCFD1A308">
in the pro&s;ecution of a manufactory; or whether the <HI>whole value pro|duced</HI> from a <HI>given capital</HI> and a <HI>given quantity of labor,</HI> employed in one way, be greater or le&s;s than the <HI>whole value produced</HI> from an <HI>equal capital</HI> and an <HI>equal quantity of labor</HI> employed in the other way; or rather, perhaps, whether the bu&s;ine&s;s of agriculture or that of manufactures will yield the greate&s;t pro|duct, according to a <HI>compound ratio</HI> of the quantity of the capital and the quan|tity of labor, which are employed in the one or in the other.</P>
<P>The &s;olution of either of the&s;e que&s;tions is not ea&s;y; it involves numerous and complicated details, depending on an accurate knowledge of the objects to be compared. It is not known that the compari&s;on has ever yet been made upon &s;ufficient data properly a&s;certained and anali&s;ed. To be able to make it on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion with &s;atisfactory preci&s;ion would demand more previous en|quiry and inve&s;tigation, than there has been hitherto either lei&s;ure or oppor|tunity to accompli&s;h.</P>
<P>Some e&s;&s;ays, however have been made towards acquiring the requi&s;ite in|formation; which have rather &s;erved to throw doubt upon, than to confirm the hypothe&s;is, under examination. But it ought to be acknowledged, that they have been too little diver&s;ified, and are too imperfect to authori&s;e a defi|nitive conclu&s;ion either way; leading rather to probable conjecture than to certain deduction. They render it probable, that there are various branches of manufactures, in which a given capital will yield a greater <HI>total</HI> product, and a con&s;iderably greater <HI>nett</HI> product, than an equal capital inve&s;ted in the pur|cha&s;e and improvement of lands; and that there are al&s;o <HI>&s;ome</HI> branches, in which both the <HI>gro&s;s</HI> and the <HI>nett</HI> produce will exceed that of agricultural indu&s;try; ac|cording to a compound ratio of capital and labor. But it is on this la&s;t point, that there appears to be the greate&s;t room for doubt. It is far le&s;s difficult to infer generally, that the <HI>nett produce</HI> of capital engaged in manufacturing en|terpri&s;es is greater than that of capital engaged in agriculture.</P>
<P>The foregoing &s;ugge&s;tions are <HI>not de&s;igned to inculcate an opinion that manufac|turing indu&s;try is more productive than that of agriculture.</HI> They are intended rather to &s;hew that the rever&s;e of this propo&s;ition is not a&s;certained; that the general arguments which are brought to e&s;tabli&s;h it are not &s;atisfactory; and con&s;equently that a &s;uppo&s;ition of the &s;uperior productivene&s;s of tillage ought to be no ob&s;tacle to li&s;tening to any &s;ub&s;tantial inducements to the encourage|ment of manufactures, which may be otherwi&s;e perceived to exi&s;t, through an apprehen&s;ion, that they may have a tendency to divert labor from a more to a le&s;s profitable employment.</P>
<P>It is extremely probable, that on a full and accurate developement of the matter, on the ground of fact and calculation, it would be di&s;covered that there is no material difference between the aggregate productivene&s;s of the one, and of the other kind of indu&s;try; and that the propriety of the encouragements, which may in any ca&s;e be propo&s;ed to be given to either, ought to be deter|mined upon con&s;iderations irrelative to any compari&s;on of that nature.</P>
<P>II. But without contending for the &s;uperior productivene&s;s of manufacturing indu&s;try, it may conduce to a better judgment of the policy, which ought to be pur&s;ued re&s;pecting its encouragement, to contemplate the &s;ubject, under &s;ome additional a&s;pects, tending not only to confirm the idea, that this kind of indu&s;try has been improperly repre&s;ented as unproductive in it&s;elf; but to evince in addition that the e&s;tabli&s;hment and diffu&s;ion of manufactures have the effect of rendering the total ma&s;s of u&s;eful and productive labor, in a commu|nity,

<HI>greater than it would otherwi&s;e be.</HI> In pro&s;ecuting this di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, it may be nece&s;&s;ary briefly to re&s;ume and review &s;ome of the topics which have been already touched.</P>
<P>To affirm that the labor of the manufacturer is unproductive becau&s;e he con&s;umes as much of the produce of land as he adds value to the raw mate|rials which he manufactures, is not better founded, than it would be to affirm, that the labor of the farmer, which furni&s;hes materials to the manufacturer, is unproductive, <HI>becau&s;e he con&s;umes an equal value of manufactured articles.</HI> Each furni&s;hes a certain portion of the produce of his labor to the other, and each de&s;troys a corre&s;pondent portion of the produce of the labor of the other. In the mean time the maintenance of two citizens, in&s;tead of one, is going on; the &s;tate has two members in&s;tead of one; and they together con&s;ume twice the value of what is produced from the land.</P>
<P>If in&s;tead of a farmer and artificer, there were a farmer only, he would be under the nece&s;&s;ity of devoting a part of his labor to the fabrication of cloath|ing and other articles, which he would procure of the artificer, in the ca&s;e of there being &s;uch a per&s;on; and of cour&s;e he would be able to devote le&s;s la|bor to the cultivation of his farm, and would draw from it a proportionably le&s;s product. The whole quantity of production, in this &s;tate of things, in provi&s;ions, raw materials and manufactures, would certainly not exceed in value the amount of what would be produced in provi&s;ions and raw materials only, if there were an artificer as well as a farmer.</P>
<P>Again&mdash;If there were both an artificer and a farmer, the latter would be left at liberty to pur&s;ue exclu&s;ively the cultivation of his farm. A greater quantity of provi&s;ions and raw materials would of cour&s;e be produced, equal, at lea&s;t, as has been already ob&s;erved, to the whole amount of the provi&s;ions, raw materials and manufactures, which would exi&s;t on a contrary &s;uppo&s;ition. The artificer, at the &s;ame time, would be going on in the production of manu|factured commodities; to an amount &s;ufficient not only to repay the farmer, in tho&s;e commodities, for the provi&s;ions and materials which were procured from him, but to furni&s;h the artificer him&s;elf with a &s;upply of &s;imilar commodi|ties for his own u&s;e. Thus then, there would be two quantities or values in ex|i&s;tence in&s;tead of one; and the revenue and con&s;umption would be double in one ca&s;e, what it would be in the other.</P>
<P>If in place of both the&s;e &s;uppo&s;itions, there were &s;uppo&s;ed to be two farmers and no artificer, each of whom applied a part of his labor to the culture of land, and another part to the fabrication of manufactures; in this ca&s;e, the portion of the labor of both be&s;towed upon land would produce the &s;ame quan|tity of provi&s;ions and raw materials only, as would be produced by the intire &s;um of the labor of one applied in the &s;ame manner, and the portion of the labor of both be&s;towed upon manufactures, would produce the &s;ame quantity of manufactures only, as would be produced by the intire &s;um of the labor of one appplied in the &s;ame manner. Hence the produce of the labor of the two farmers would not be greater than the produce of the labor of the farmer and artificer; and hence it re&s;ults, that the labor of the artificer is as po&s;itive|ly productive as that of the farmer, and, as po&s;itively, augments the revenue of the &s;ociety.</P>
<P>The labor of the artificer replaces to the farmer that portion of his labor with which he provides the materials of exchange with the artificer, and which he would otherwi&s;e have been compelled to apply to manufactures; and while
<PB N="8" REF="023914_0010_0FC2858A1085DBC0">
the artificer thus enables the farmer to enlarge his &s;tock of agricultural indu&s;|try, a portion of which he purcha&s;es for his own u&s;e, <HI>be al&s;o &s;upplies him&s;elf with the manufactured articles of which he &s;tands in need.</HI> He does &s;till more&mdash;Be&s;ides this equivalent which he gives for the portion of agricultural labor con&s;umed by him, and this &s;upply of manufactured commodities for his own con&s;umption; he furni&s;hes &s;till a &s;urplus, which compen&s;ates for the u&s;e of the capital advanced either by him&s;elf or &s;ome other per&s;on, for carrying on the bu&s;ine&s;s. This is the ordinary profit of the &s;tock employed in the manu|factory, and is, in every &s;en&s;e, as effective an addition to the income of the &s;ociety as the rent of land.</P>
<P>The produce of the labor of the artificer con&s;equently, may be regarded as compo&s;ed of three parts; one by which the provi&s;ions for his &s;ub&s;i&s;tence and the materials for his work are purcha&s;ed of the farmer, one by which he &s;up|plies him&s;elf with manufactured nece&s;&s;aries, and a third which con&s;titutes the profit on the &s;tock employed. The two la&s;t portions &s;eem to have been over|looked in the &s;y&s;tem, which repre&s;ents manufacturing indu&s;try as barren and unproductive.</P>
<P>In the cour&s;e of the preceding illu&s;trations, the products of equal quantities of the labor of the farmer and artificer have been treated as if equal to each other. But this is not to be under&s;tood as intending to a&s;&s;ert any &s;uch pre|ci&s;e equality. It is merely a manner of expre&s;&s;ion adopted for the &s;ake of &s;im|plicity and per&s;picuity. Whether the value of the produce of the labor of the farmer be &s;omewhat more or le&s;s, than that of the artificer, is not material to the main &s;cope of the argument, which hitherto has only aimed at &s;hewing that the one, as well as the other, occa&s;ions a po&s;itive augmentation of the total produce and revenue of the &s;ociety.</P>
<P>It is now proper to proceed a &s;tep further, and to enumerate the principal circum&s;tances, from which it may be inferred. That manufacturing e&s;ta|bli&s;hments not only occa&s;ion a po&s;itive augmentation of the produce and re|venue of the &s;ociety, but that they contribute e&s;&s;entially to rendering them greater than they could po&s;&s;ibly be, without &s;uch e&s;tabli&s;hments. The&s;e cir|cum&s;tances are,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. The divi&s;ion of labor.</ITEM>

Each of the&s;e circum&s;tances has a con&s;iderable influence upon the total ma&s;s of indu&s;trious effort in a community: together, they add to it a degree of energy and effect, which are not ea&s;ily conceived.

<P><PB N="9" REF="023914_0011_0FC2858B4BC152B8">
I. <HI>As to the divi&s;ion of labor.&mdash;</HI></P>
<P>It has ju&s;tly been ob&s;erved, that there is &s;carcely any thing of greater mo|ment in the oeconomy of a nation, than the proper divi&s;ion of labor. The &s;eparation of occupations cau&s;es each to be carried to a much greater perfec|tion than it could po&s;&s;ibly acquire, if they were blended. This ari&s;es prin|cipally from three circum&s;tances.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t. The greater &s;kill and dexterity naturally re&s;ulting from a con&s;tant and undivided application to a &s;ingle object. It is evident, that the&s;e properties mu&s;t increa&s;e, in proportion to the &s;eparation and &s;implification of objects and the &s;teadine&s;s of the attention devoted to each; and mu&s;t be le&s;s, in proportion to the complication of objects, and the number among which the attention is di&s;tracted.</P>
<P N="2">2d. The oeconomy of time, by avoiding the lo&s;s of it, incident to a frequent tran&s;ition from one operation to another of a different nature. This depends on various circum&s;tances; the tran&s;ition it&s;elf, the orderly di&s;po&s;ition of the implements, machines and materials employed in the operation to be relin|qui&s;hed, the preparatory &s;teps to the commencement of a new one, the in|terruption of the impul&s;e, which the mind of the workman acquires, from being engaged in a particular operation; the di&s;tractions, he&s;itations and re|luctances, which attend the pa&s;&s;age from one kind of bu&s;ine&s;s to another.</P>
<P N="3">3d. An exten&s;ion of the u&s;e of machinery.&mdash;A man occupied on a &s;ingle object will have it more in his power, and will be more naturally led to exert his imagination in devi&s;ing methods to facilitate and abrige labor, than if he were perplexed by a variety of independent and di&s;&s;imilar operations. Be&s;ides this, the fabrication of machines, in numerous in&s;tances, becoming it&s;elf a di&s;tinct trade, the arti&s;t who follows it, has all the advantages which have been enumerated, for improvement in his particular art; and in both ways the invention and application of machinery are extended.</P>
<P>And from the&s;e cau&s;es united, the mere &s;eparation of the occupation of the cultivator, from that of the artificer, has the effect of augmenting the <HI>pro|ductive powers</HI> of labor, and with them, the total ma&s;s of the produce or re|venue of a country. In this &s;ingle view of the &s;ubject, therefore, the utility of artificers or manufacturers, towards promoting an increa&s;e of productive indu&s;try, is apparent.</P>
<P>II. <HI>As to an exten&s;ion of the u&s;e of machinery, a point which though partly antici|pated, requires to be placed in one or two additional lights.</HI></P>
<P>The employment of machinery forms an item of great importance in the general ma&s;s of national indu&s;try. 'Tis an artificial force brought in aid of the natural force of man; and, to all the purpo&s;es of labor, is an increa&s;e of hands; an acce&s;&s;ion of &s;trength, <HI>unincumbered too by the expence of maintaining the laborer.</HI> May it not therefore be fairly inferred, that tho&s;e occupations, which give greate&s;t &s;cope to the u&s;e of this auxiliary, contribute mo&s;t to the general &s;tock of indu&s;trious effort, and, in con&s;equence, to the general product of indu&s;try?</P>
<P>It &s;hall be taken for granted, and the truth of the po&s;ition referred to ob|&s;ervation, that manufacturing pur&s;uits are &s;u&s;ceptible in a greater degree of the application of machinery, than tho&s;e of agriculture. If &s;o, all the difference
<PB N="10" REF="023914_0012_0FC2858CE069E5B8">
is lo&s;t to a community, which, in&s;tead of manufacturing for it&s;elf, procures the fabrics requi&s;ite to its &s;upply from other countries. The &s;ub&s;titution of foreign for dome&s;tic manufactures is a transfer to foreign nations of the advan|tages accruing from the employment of machinery, in the modes in which it is capable of being employed, with mo&s;t utility and to the greate&s;t extent.</P>
<P>The cotton mill invented in England, within the la&s;t twenty years, is a &s;ig|nal illu&s;tration of the general propo&s;ition, which has been ju&s;t advanced. In con&s;equence of it, all the different proce&s;&s;es for &s;pinning cotton are performed by means of machines, which are put in motion by water, and attended chief|ly by women and children; and by a &s;maller number of per&s;ons, in the whole, than are requi&s;ite in the ordinary mode of &s;pinning. And it is an advantage of great moment that the operations of this mill continue with convenience, during the night, as well as through the day. The prodigious effect of &s;uch a machine is ea&s;ily conceived. To this invention is to be attributed e&s;&s;en|tially the immen&s;e progre&s;s, which has been &s;o &s;uddenly made in Great Bri|tain in the various fabrics of cotton.</P>
<P>III. <HI>As to the additional employment of cla&s;&s;es of the community, not originally en|gaged in the particular bu&s;ine&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>This is not among the lea&s;t valuable of the means, by which manufacturing in&s;titutions contribute to augment the general &s;tock of indu&s;try and produc|tion. In places where tho&s;e in&s;titutions prevail, be&s;ides the per&s;ons regularly engaged in them, they afford occa&s;ional and extra employment to indu&s;trious individuals and families, who are willing to devote the lei&s;ure re&s;ulting from the intermi&s;&s;ions of their ordinary pur&s;uits to collateral labors, as a re&s;ource for multiplying their acqui&s;itions or their enjoyments. The hu&s;bandman him&s;elf experiences a new &s;ource of profit and &s;upport from the encrea&s;ed indu&s;try of his wife and daughters; invited and &s;timulated by the demands of the neigh|bouring manufactories.</P>
<P>Be&s;ide this advantage of occa&s;ional employment to cla&s;&s;es having different occupations, there is another of a nature allied to it and of a &s;imilar tendency. This is, the employment of per&s;ons who would otherwi&s;e be idle (and in many ca&s;es a burthen on the community) either from the bias of temper, habit, infirmity of body, or &s;ome other cau&s;e, indi&s;po&s;ing or di&s;qualifying them for the toils of the country. It is worthy of particular remark, that, in general, women and children are rendered more u&s;eful, and the latter more early u&s;e|ful, by manufacturing e&s;tabli&s;hments, than they would otherwi&s;e be. Of the number of per&s;ons employed in the cotton manufactories of Great-Britain, it is computed that 4/7 nearly are women and children; of whom the greate&s;t proportion are children, and many of them of a tender age.</P>
<P>And thus is appears to be one of the attributes of manufactures, and one of no &s;mall con&s;equence, to give occa&s;ion to the exertion of a greater quantity of indu&s;try, even by the <HI>&s;ame number</HI> of per&s;ons, where they happen to prevail, than would exi&s;t, if there were no &s;uch e&s;tabli&s;hments.</P>
<P>IV. <HI>As to the promoting of emigration from foreign countries.</HI></P>
<P>Men reluctantly quit one cour&s;e of occupation and livelihood for another, unle&s;s invited to it by very apparent and proximate advantages. Many, who would go from one country to another, if they had a pro&s;pect of continuing, with more benefit, the callings to which they have been educated, will often
<PB N="11" REF="023914_0013_0FC285972D61B8B8">
not be tempted to change their &s;ituation by the hope of doing better in &s;ome other way. Manufacturers who, li&s;tening to the powerful invitations of a better price for their fabrics, or their labor, of greater cheapne&s;s of provi|&s;ions and raw materials, of an exemption from the chief part of the taxes, burthens and re&s;traints, which they endure in the old world, of greater per|&s;onal independence and con&s;equence, under the operation of a more equal government, and of what is far more precious than mere religious toleration, a perfect equality of religious privileges; would probably flock from Europe to the United States to pur&s;ue their own trades or profe&s;&s;ions, if they were once made &s;en&s;ible of the advantages they would enjoy, and were in&s;pired with an a&s;&s;urance of encouragement and employment, will, with difficulty, be induced to tran&s;plant them&s;elves, with a view to becoming cultivators of land.</P>
<P>If it be true then, that it is the intere&s;t of the United States to open every po&s;&s;ible avenue to emigration from abroad, it affords a weighty argument for the encouragement of manufactures; which, for the rea&s;ons ju&s;t a&s;&s;igned, will have the &s;tronge&s;t tendency to multiply the inducements to it.</P>
<P>Here is perceived an important re&s;ource, not only for extending the popu|lation, and with it the u&s;eful and productive labor of the country, but like|wi&s;e for the pro&s;ecution of manufactures, without deducting from the nu|mber of hands, which might otherwi&s;e be drawn to tillage; and even for the indemnification of agriculture for &s;uch as might happen to be diverted from it. Many, whom manufacturing views would induce to emigrate, would af|terwards yield to the temptations, which the particular &s;ituation of this coun|try holds out to agricultural pur&s;uits. And while agriculture would in other re&s;pects derive many &s;ignal and unmingled advantages, from the growth of manufactures, it is a problem whether it would gain or lo&s;e, as to the article of the number of per&s;ons employed in carrying it on.</P>
<P>V. <HI>As to the furni&s;hing greater &s;cope for the diver&s;ity of talents and di&s;po&s;itions, which di&s;criminate mem from each other.</HI></P>
<P>This is a much more powerful mean of augmenting the fund of national indu&s;try than may at fir&s;t &s;ight appear. It is a ju&s;t ob&s;ervation, that minds of the &s;tronge&s;t and mo&s;t active powers for their proper objects fall below medi|ocrity and labor without effect, if confined to uncongenial pur&s;uits. And it is thence to be inferred, that the re&s;ults of human exertion may be immen&s;e|ly increa&s;ed by diver&s;ifying its objects. When all the different kinds of in|du&s;try obtain in a community, each individual can find his proper element, and can call into activity the whole vigour of his nature. And the communi|ty is benefited by the &s;ervices of its re&s;pective members, in the manner, in which each can &s;erve it with mo&s;t effect.</P>
<P>If there be any thing in a remark often to be met with, namely, that there is, in the genius of the people of this country, a peculiar aptitude for me|chanic improvements, it would operate as a forcible rea&s;on for giving oppor|tunities to the exerci&s;e of that &s;pecies of talent, by the propagation of manu|factures.</P>
<P>VI. <HI>As to the affording a more ample and various field for enterpri&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>This al&s;o is of greater con&s;equence in the general &s;cale of national exer|tion, than might perhaps on a &s;uperficial view be &s;uppo&s;ed, and has effects
<PB N="12" REF="023914_0014_0FC2859838AEF4B0">
not altogether di&s;&s;imilar from tho&s;e of the circum&s;tance la&s;t noticed. To che|ri&s;h and &s;timulate the activity of the human mind, by multiplying the objects of enterpri&s;e, is not among the lea&s;t con&s;iderable of the expedients, by which the wealth of a nation may be promoted. Even things in them&s;elves, not po&s;itively advantageous, &s;ometimes become &s;o, by their tendency to provoke exertion. Every new &s;cene which is opened to the bu&s;y nature of man to rou&s;e and exert it&s;elf, is the addition of a new energy to the general &s;tock of effort.</P>
<P>The &s;pirit of enterpri&s;e, u&s;eful and prolific as it is, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be con|tracted or expanded in proportion to the &s;implicity or variety of the occupa|tions and productions, which are to be found in a &s;ociety. It mu&s;t be le&s;s in a nation of mere cultivators, than in a nation of cultivators and merchants; le&s;s in a nation of cultivators and merchants, than in a nation of cultivators, artificers and merchants.</P>
<P>VII. <HI>As to the creating, in &s;ome in&s;tances, a new, and &s;ecuring in all a more cer|tain and &s;teady demand, for the &s;urplus produce of the &s;oil.</HI></P>
<P>This is among the mo&s;t important of the circum&s;tances which have been indicated. It is a principal mean, by which the e&s;tabli&s;hment of manufactures contributes to an augmentation of the produce or revenue of a country, and has an immediate and direct relation to the pro&s;perity of agriculture.</P>
<P>It is evident, that the exertions of the hu&s;bandman will be &s;teady or fluc|tuating, vigorous or feeble, in proportion to the &s;teadine&s;s or fluctuation, adequatene&s;s, or inadequatene&s;s of the markets on which he mu&s;t depend, for the vent of the &s;urplus, which may be produced by his labor; and that &s;uch &s;urplus in the ordinary cour&s;e of things will be greater or le&s;s in the &s;ame proportion.</P>
<P>For the purpo&s;e of this vent, a dome&s;tic market is greatly to be preferred to a foreign one; becau&s;e it is in the nature of things, far more to be relied upon.</P>
<P>It is a primary object of the policy of nations, to be able to &s;upply them|&s;elves with &s;ub&s;i&s;tence from their own &s;oils; and manufacturing nations, as far as circum&s;tances permit, endeavour to procure from the &s;ame &s;ource, the raw materials nece&s;&s;ary for their own fabrics. This di&s;po&s;ition, urged by the &s;pirit of monopoly, is &s;ometimes even carried to an injudicious extreme. It &s;eems not always to be recollected, that nations, who have neither mines nor manufactures, can only obtain the manufactured articles, of which they &s;tand in need, by an exchange of the products of their &s;oils, and that, if tho&s;e who can be&s;t furni&s;h them with &s;uch articles are unwilling to give a due cour&s;e to this exchange, they mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity make every po&s;&s;ible effort to manufacture for them&s;elves; the effect of which is that the manufacturing nations abrige the natural advantages of their &s;ituation, through an unwillingne&s;s to permit the agricultural countries to enjoy the advantages of theirs, and &s;acrifice the intere&s;ts of a mutually beneficial intercour&s;e to the vain project of <HI>&s;elling every thing</HI> and <HI>buying nothing.</HI></P>
<P>But it is al&s;o a con&s;equence of the policy, which has been noted, that the foreign demand for the products of agricultural countries, is, in a great degree, rather ca&s;ual and occa&s;ional, than certain or con&s;tant. To what extent in|jurious interruptions of the demand for &s;ome of the &s;taple commodities of the United States, may have been experienced, from that cau&s;e, mu&s;t be referred
<PB N="13" REF="023914_0015_0FC28599903D0F08">
to the judgment of tho&s;e who are engaged in carrying on the commerce of the country; but it may be &s;afely affirmed, that &s;uch interruptions are at times very inconveniently felt, and that ca&s;es not unfrequently occur, in which mar|kets are &s;o confined and re&s;tricted, as to render the demand very unequal to the &s;upply.</P>
<P>Independently likewi&s;e of the artificial impediments, which are created by the policy in que&s;tion, there are natural cau&s;es tending to render the external demand for the &s;urplus of agricultural nations a precarious reliance. The differences of &s;ea&s;ons, in the countries which are the con&s;umers, make im|men&s;e differences in the produce of their own &s;oils, in different years; and con&s;equently in the degrees of their nece&s;&s;ity for foreign &s;upply. Plentiful harve&s;ts with them, e&s;pecially if &s;imilar ones, occur at the &s;ame time in the countries which are the furni&s;hers, occa&s;ion of cour&s;e a glut in the markets of the latter.</P>
<P>Con&s;idering how fa&s;t and how much the progre&s;s of new &s;ettlements in the United States mu&s;t encrea&s;e the &s;urplus produce of the &s;oil, and weighing &s;eri|ou&s;ly the tendency of the &s;y&s;tem, which prevails among mo&s;t of the commer|cial nations of Europe; whatever dependence may be placed on the force of natural circum&s;tances to counteract the effects of an artificial policy; there appear &s;trong rea&s;ons to regard the foreign demand for that &s;urplus as too uncertain a reliance, and to de&s;ire a &s;ub&s;titute for it, in an exten&s;ive dome&s;tic market.</P>
<P>To &s;ecure &s;uch a market, there is no other expedient, than to promote ma|nufacturing e&s;tabli&s;hments. Manufacturers who con&s;titute the mo&s;t nume|rous cla&s;s, after the cultivators of land, are for that rea&s;on the principal con|&s;umers of the &s;urplus of their labor.</P>
<P>This idea of an exten&s;ive dome&s;tic market for the &s;urplus produce of the &s;oil is of the fir&s;t con&s;equence. It is of all things, that which mo&s;t effectually con|duces to a flouri&s;hing &s;tate of agriculture. If the effect of manufactories &s;hould be to detach a portion of the hands, which would otherwi&s;e be engaged in til|lage, it might po&s;&s;ibly cau&s;e a &s;maller quantity of lands to be under cultivation; but by their tendency to procure a more certain demand for the &s;urplus produce of the &s;oil, they would, at the &s;ame time, cau&s;e the lands which were in cultiva|tion, to be better improved and more productive. And while, by their influ|ence, the condition of each individual farmer would be meliorated, the total ma&s;s of agricultural production would probably be encrea&s;ed. For this mu&s;t evidently depend as much, if not more, upon the degree of improvement, than upon the number of acres under culture.</P>
<P>It merits particular ob&s;ervation, that the multiplication of manufactories not only furni&s;hes a market for tho&s;e articles which have been accu&s;tomed to be produced in abundance, in a country; but it likewi&s;e creates a demand for &s;uch as were either unknown or produced in incon&s;iderable quantities. The bowels as well as the &s;urface of the earth are ran&s;acked for articles which were before neglected. Animals, plants and minerals acquire a utility and value, which were before unexplored.</P>
<P>The foregoing con&s;iderations &s;eem &s;ufficient to e&s;tabli&s;h, as general propo&s;i|tions, that it is the intere&s;t of nations to diver&s;ify the indu&s;trious pur&s;uits of the individuals, who compo&s;e them&mdash;That the e&s;tabli&s;hment of manufactures is calculated not only to encrea&s;e the general &s;tock of u&s;eful and productive la|bor; but even to improve the &s;tate of agriculture in particular; certainly to

advance the intere&s;ts of tho&s;e who are engaged in it. There are other views, that will be hereafter taken of the &s;ubject, which, it is conceived, will &s;erve to confirm the&s;e inferences.</P>
<P>III. Previou&s;ly to a further di&s;cu&s;ion of the objections to the encouragement of manufactures which have been &s;tated, it will be of u&s;e to &s;ee what can be &s;aid in reference to the particular &s;ituation of the United States, again&s;t the con|clu&s;ions appearing to re&s;ult from what has been already offered.</P>
<P>It may be ob&s;erved, and the idea is of no incon&s;iderable weight, that howe|ver true it might be, that a &s;tate, which po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing large tracts of vacant and fertile territory, was at the &s;ame time &s;ecluded from foreign commerce, would find its intere&s;t and the intere&s;t of agriculture, in diverting a part of its popu|lation from tillage to manufactures; yet it will not follow, that the &s;ame is true of a &s;tate, which having &s;uch vacant and fertile territory, has at the &s;ame time ample opportunity of procuring from abroad, on good terms, all the fabrics of which it &s;tands in need, for the &s;upply of its inhabitants. The p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">wer of doing this at lea&s;t &s;ecures the great advantage of a divi&s;ion of labor, leaving the farmer free to pur&s;ue exclu&s;ively the culture of his land, and ena|bling him to procure with its products the manufactured &s;upplies requi&s;ite either to his wants or to his enjoyments. And though it &s;hould be true, that in &s;ettled countries, the diver&s;ification of indu&s;try is conducive to an encrea&s;e in the productive powers of labor, and to an augmentation of revenue and ca|pital; yet it is &s;carcely conceivable that there can be any thing of &s;o &s;olid and permanent advantage to an uncultivated and unpeopled country, as to convert its wa&s;tes into cultivated and inhabited di&s;tricts. If the revenue, in the mean time, &s;hould be le&s;s, the capital, in the event, mu&s;t be greater.</P>
<P>To the&s;e ob&s;ervations, the following appears to be a &s;atisfactory an&s;wer&mdash;</P>
<P N="1">1. If the &s;y&s;tem of perfect liberty to indu&s;try and commerce were the pre|vailing &s;y&s;tem of nations, the arguments which di&s;&s;uade a country in the pre|dicament of the United States, from the zealous pur&s;uit of manufactures would doubtle&s;s have great force. It will not be affirmed, that they might not be permitted, with few exceptions, to &s;erve as a rule of national conduct. In &s;uch a &s;tate of things, each country would have the full benefit of its pe|culiar advantages to compen&s;ate for its deficiencies or di&s;advantages. If one nation were in condition to &s;upply manufactured articles on bet|ter terms than another, that other might find an abundant indemnifica|tion in a &s;uperior capacity to furni&s;h the produce of the &s;oil. And a free exchange, mutually beneficial, of the commodities which each was able to &s;upply, on the be&s;t terms, might be carried on between them, &s;upporting in full vigour the indu&s;try of each. And though the circum&s;tances which have been mentioned, and others which will be unfolded hereafter, render it probable, that nations merely agricultural, would not enjoy the &s;ame degree of opulence, in proportion to their numbers, as tho&s;e which united manufac|tures with agriculture; yet the progre&s;&s;ive improvement of the lands of the former, might in the end, atone for an inferior degree of opulence in the mean time; and in a ca&s;e, in which oppo&s;ite con&s;iderations are pretty equally balanced, the option ought perhaps always to be, in favor of leaving indu&s;try to its own direction.</P>
<P>But the &s;y&s;tem, which has been mentioned, is far from characteri&s;ing the general policy of nations. The prevalent one has been regulated by an oppo|&s;ite &s;pirit. The con&s;equence of it is, that the United States are to a certain extent in the &s;ituation of a country precluded from foreign commerce. They
<PB N="15" REF="023914_0017_0FC285A6504F1838">
can indeed, without difficulty, obtain from abroad the manufactured &s;upplies, of which they are in want; but they experience numerous and very injurious impediments to the emi&s;&s;ion and vent of their own commodities. Nor is this the ca&s;e in reference to a &s;ingle foreign nation only. The regulations of &s;eve|ral countries, with which we have the mo&s;t exten&s;ive intercour&s;e, throw &s;eri|ous ob&s;tructions in the way of the principal &s;taples of the United States.</P>
<P>In &s;uch a po&s;ition of things, the United States cannot exchange with Eu|rope on equal terms; and the want of reciprocity would render them the vic|tim of a &s;y&s;tem, which &s;hould induce them to confine their views to agricul|ture, and refrain from manufactures. A con&s;tant and encrea&s;ing nece&s;&s;ity, on their part, for the commodities of Europe, and only a partial and occa&s;i|onal demand for their own, in return, could not but expo&s;e them to a &s;tate of impoveri&s;hment, compared with the opulence to which their political and na|tural advantages authori&s;e them to a&s;pire.</P>
<P>Remarks of this kind are not made in the &s;pirit of complaint. 'Tis for the nations, who&s;e regulations are alluded to, to judge for them&s;elves, whether by aiming at too much, they do not lo&s;e more than they gain. 'Tis for the United States to con&s;ider by what means they can render them&s;elves lea&s;t de|pendent, on the combinations, right or wrong, of foreign policy.</P>
<P>It is no &s;mall con&s;olation, that already the mea&s;ures which have embarra&s;|&s;ed our trade, have accelerated internal improvements, which upon the whole have bettered our affairs. To diver&s;ify and extend the&s;e improvements, is the &s;ure&s;t and &s;afe&s;t method of indemnifying our&s;elves for any inconveniencies, which tho&s;e or &s;imilar mea&s;ures have a tendency to beget. If Europe will not take from us the products of our &s;oil, upon terms con&s;i&s;tent with our in|tere&s;t, the natural remedy is to contract as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible our wants of her.</P>
<P N="2">The conver&s;ion of their wa&s;te into cultivated lands is certainly a point of great moment in the political calculations of the United States. But the degree in which this may po&s;&s;ibly be retarded by the encouragement of ma|nufactories does not appear to countervail the powerful inducements to afford|ing that encouragement.</P>
<P>An ob&s;ervation made in another place is of a nature to have great influence upon this que&s;tion&mdash;If it cannot be denied, that the intere&s;ts even of agricul|ture may be advanced more by having &s;uch of the lands of a &s;tate as are occu|pied under good cultivation, than by having a greater quantity occupied un|der a much inferior cultivation, and if manufactories, for the rea&s;ons a&s;&s;igned, mu&s;t be admitted to have a tendency to promote a more &s;teady and vigorous cultivation of the lands occupied, than would happen without them, it will follow, that they are capable of indemnifying a country for a diminuti|on of the progre&s;s of new &s;ettlements; and may &s;erve to encrea&s;e both the capital value and the income of its lands, even though they &s;hould abridge the number of acres under tillage.</P>
<P>But it does, by no means, follow, that the progre&s;s of new &s;ettlements would be retarded by the exten&s;ion of manufactures. The de&s;ire of being an independent proprietor of land is founded on &s;uch &s;trong principles in the hu|man brea&s;t, that where the opportunity of becoming &s;o is as great as it is in the United States, the proportion will be &s;mall of tho&s;e, who&s;e &s;ituations would otherwi&s;e lead to it, who would be diverted from it towards manufactures. And it is highly probable, as already intimated, that the acce&s;&s;ions of foreigners, who originally drawn over by manufacturing views would afterwards aban|don
<PB N="16" REF="023914_0018_0FC285A7FA917050">
them for agricultural, would be more than an equivalent for tho&s;e of our own citizens, who might happen to be detached from them.</P>
<P>The remaining objections to a particular encouragement of manufactures in the United States now require to be examined.</P>
<P>One of the&s;e tu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">s on the propo&s;ition, that indu&s;try, if left to it&s;elf, will naturally find its way to the mo&s;t u&s;eful and profitable employment: whence it is inferred that manufactures without the aid of government, will grow up as &s;oon and as fa&s;t, as the natural &s;tate of things and the intere&s;t of the com|munity may require.</P>
<P>Again&s;t the &s;olidity of this hypothe&s;is, in the full latitude of the terms, very cogent rea&s;ons may be offered. The&s;e have relation to the &s;trong influence of habit and the &s;pirit of imitation, the fear of want of &s;ucce&s;s in untried en|terpri&s;es, the intrin&s;ic difficulties incident to fir&s;t e&s;&s;ays towards a competition with tho&s;e who have previou&s;ly attained to perfection in the bu&s;ine&s;s to be at|tempted, the bounties, premiums and other artificial encouragements, with which foreign nations &s;econd the exertions of their own citizens in the branches, in which they are to be rivalled.</P>
<P>Experience teaches, that men are often &s;o much governed by what they are accu&s;tomed to &s;ee and practice, that the &s;imple&s;t and mo&s;t obvious im|provements, in the mo&s;t ordinary occupations, are adopted with he&s;itation, reluctance and by &s;low gradations. The &s;pontaneous tran&s;ition to new pur&s;uits, in a community long habituated to different ones, may be expected to be attended with proportionably greater difficulty. When for|mer occupations cea&s;ed to yield a profit adequate to the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of their followers, or when there was an ab&s;olute deficiency of employment in them, owing to the &s;uperabundance of hands, changes would en&s;ue; but the&s;e changes would be likely to be more tardy than might con&s;i&s;t with the intere&s;t either of individuals or of the &s;ociety. In many ca&s;es they would not happen, while a bare &s;upport could be en&s;ured by an adherence to ancient cour&s;es; though a re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ort to a more profitable employment might be practica|ble. To produce the de&s;irable changes, as early as may be expedient, may therefore require the incitement and patronage of government.</P>
<P>The apprehen&s;ion of failing in new attempts is perhaps a more &s;erious impe|diment. There are di&s;po&s;itions apt to be attracted by the mere novelty of an undertaking; but the&s;e are not always tho&s;e be&s;t calculated to give it &s;ucce&s;s. To this, it is of importance that the confidence of cautious, &s;agacious capital|i&s;ts, both citizens and foreigners, &s;hould be excited. And to in&s;pire this de|&s;cription of per&s;ons with confidence, it is e&s;&s;ential, that they &s;hould be made to &s;ee in any project, which is new, and for that rea&s;on alone, if for no other, precarious, the pro&s;pect of &s;uch a degree of countenance and &s;upport from government, as may be capable of overcoming the ob&s;tacles, in&s;eparable from fir&s;t experiments.</P>
<P>The &s;uperiority antecedently enjoyed by nations, who have pre-occupied and perfected a branch of indu&s;try, con&s;titutes a more formidable ob&s;tacle, than either of tho&s;e, which have been mentioned, to the introduction of the &s;ame branch into a country, in which it did not before exi&s;t. To maintain between the recent e&s;tabli&s;hments of one country and the long matured e&s;tabli&s;hments of another country, a competition upon equal terms, both as to quality and price, is in mo&s;t ca&s;es impracticable. The di&s;parity, in the one, or in the other, or in both, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be &s;o con&s;iderable as to forbid a &s;ucce&s;sful rival&s;hip, without the extraordinary aid and protection of government.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="023914_0019_0FC285B58B6BC078">
But the greate&s;t ob&s;tacle of all to the &s;ucce&s;sful pro&s;ecution of a new branch of indu&s;try in a country, in which it was before unknown, con&s;i&s;ts, as far as the in&s;tances apply, in the bounties, premiums and other aids which are grant|ed, in a variety of ca&s;es, by the nations in which the e&s;tabli&s;hments to be imi|tated are previou&s;ly introduced. It is well known (and particular ex|amples in the cour&s;e of this report will be cited) that certain nations grant bounties on the exportation of particular commodities, to enable their own workmen to under&s;ell and &s;upplant all competitors, in the countries to which tho&s;e commodities are &s;ent. Hence the undertakers of a new manufacture have to contend not only with the natural di&s;advantages of a new undertaking, but with the gratuities and remunerations which other governments be&s;tow. To be enabled to contend with &s;ucce&s;s, it is evident, that the interference and aid of their own government are indi&s;pen&s;able.</P>
<P>Combinations by tho&s;e engaged in a particular branch of bu&s;ine&s;s in one country, to fru&s;trate the fir&s;t efforts to introduce it into another, by temporary &s;acrifices, recompen&s;ed perhaps by extraordinary indemnifications of the go|vernment of &s;uch country, are believed to have exi&s;ted, and are not to be re|garded as de&s;titute of probability. The exi&s;tence or a&s;&s;urance of aid from the government of the country, in which the bu&s;ine&s;s is to be introduced, may be e&s;&s;ential to fortify adventurers again&s;t the dread of &s;uch combinations&mdash;to de|feat their effects, if formed, and to prevent their being formed, by demon|&s;trating that they mu&s;t in the end prove fruitle&s;s.</P>
<P>Whatever room there may be for an expectation that the indu&s;try of a peo|ple, under the direction of private intere&s;t, will upon equal terms find out the mo&s;t beneficial employment for it&s;elf, there is none for a reliance, that it will &s;truggle again&s;t the force of unequal terms, or will of it&s;elf &s;urmount all the adventitious barriers to a &s;ucce&s;sful competition, which may have been erect|ed either by the advantages naturally acquired from practice and previous po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the ground, or by tho&s;e which may have &s;prung from po&s;itive re|gulations and an artificial policy. This general reflection might alone &s;uffice as an an&s;wer to the objection under examination; exclu&s;ively of the weighty con&s;iderations which have been particularly urged.</P>
<P>The objections to the pur&s;uit of manufactures in the United States, which next pre&s;ent them&s;elves to di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, repre&s;ent an impracticability of &s;ucce&s;s, ari&s;ing from three cau&s;es&mdash;&s;carcity of hands, dearne&s;s of labour, want of ca|pital.</P>
<P>The two fir&s;t circum&s;tances are to a certain extent real, and, within due limits, ought to be admitted as ob&s;tacles to the &s;ucce&s;s of manufacturing enter|pri&s;e in the United States. But there are various con&s;iderations, which le&s;|&s;en their force, and tend to afford an a&s;&s;urance that they are not &s;ufficient to prevent the advantageous pro&s;ecution of many very u&s;eful and exten&s;ive ma|nufactories.</P>
<P>With regard to &s;carcity of hands, the fact it&s;elf mu&s;t be applied with no &s;mall qualification to certain parts of the United States. There are large di&s;tricts, which may be con&s;idered as pretty fully peopled; and which notwith&s;tanding a continual drain for di&s;tant &s;ettlement, are thickly in|ter&s;per&s;ed with flouri&s;hing and encrea&s;ing towns. If the&s;e di&s;tricts have not already reached the point, at which the complaint of &s;carcity of hands cea&s;es, they are not remote from it, and are approaching fa&s;t to|wards it: And having perhaps fewer attractions to agriculture, than &s;ome
<PB N="18" REF="023914_0020_0FC285B6CCB900F8">
other parts of the union, they exhibit a proportionably &s;tronger tendency to|wards other kinds of indu&s;try. In the&s;e di&s;tricts, may be di&s;cerned, no in|con&s;iderable maturity for manufacturing e&s;tabli&s;hments.</P>
<P>But there are circum&s;tances, which have been already noticed with another view, that materially dimini&s;h every where the effect of a &s;carcity of hands. The&s;e circum&s;tances are&mdash;the great u&s;e which can be made of women and children; on which point a very pregnant and in&s;tructive fact has been men|tioned; the va&s;t exten&s;ion given by late improvements to the employment of machines, which &s;ub&s;tituting the agency of fire and water, has prodigiou&s;ly le&s;|&s;ened the nece&s;&s;ity for manual labor; the employment of per&s;ons ordinarily engaged in other occupations, during the &s;ea&s;ons, or hours of lei&s;ure; which, be&s;ides giving occa&s;ion to the exertion of a greater quantity of labor by the &s;ame number of per&s;ons, and thereby encrea&s;ing the general &s;tock of labor as has been el&s;ewhere remarked, may al&s;o be taken into the calculation, as a re|&s;ource for obviating the &s;carcity of hands&mdash;la&s;tly, the attraction of foreign emigrants. Whoever in&s;pects with a careful eye, the compo&s;ition of our towns, will be made &s;en&s;ible to what an extent this re&s;ource may be relied upon. This exhibits a large proportion of ingenious and valuable workmen, in different arts and trades, who, by expatriating from Europe, have improv|ed their own condition, and added to the indu&s;try and wealth of the United States. It is a natural inference from the experience, we have already had, that as &s;oon as the United States &s;hall pre&s;ent the countenance of a &s;erious pro|&s;ecution of manufactures, as &s;oon as foreign arti&s;ts &s;hall be made &s;en&s;ible that the &s;tate of things here affords a moral certainty of employment and encou|ragement, competent numbers of European workmen will tran&s;plant them&s;elves, effectually to en&s;ure the &s;ucce&s;s of the de&s;ign. How indeed can it otherwi&s;e happen con&s;idering the various and powerful inducements, which the &s;ituati|on of this country offers; addre&s;&s;ing them&s;elves to &s;o many &s;trong pa&s;&s;ions and feelings, to &s;o many general and particular intere&s;ts:</P>
<P>It may be affirmed therefore, in re&s;pect to hands for carrying on manufac|tures, that we &s;hall in a great mea&s;ure trade upon a foreign &s;tock; re&s;erving our own, for the cultivation of our lands, and the manning of our &s;hips; as far as character and circum&s;tances &s;hall incline. It is not unworthy of remark, that the objection to the &s;ucce&s;s of manufactures, deduced from the &s;carcity of hands, is alike applicable to trade and navigation, and yet the&s;e are perceived to flouri&s;h, without any &s;en&s;ible impediment from that cau&s;e.</P>
<P>As to the dearne&s;s of labor (another of the ob&s;tacles alledged) this has rela|tion principally to two circum&s;tances; one that which has been ju&s;t di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, or the &s;carcity of hands; the other, the greatne&s;s of profits.</P>
<P>As far as it is a con&s;equence of the &s;carcity of hands, it is mitigated by all the con&s;iderations which have been adduced as le&s;&s;ening that deficiency. It is certain too, that the di&s;parity in this re&s;pect, between &s;ome of the mo&s;t manu|facturing parts of Europe and a large proportion of the United States, is not nearly &s;o great as is commonly imagined. It is al&s;o much le&s;s in regard to artificers and manufacturers than in regard to country laborers; and while a careful compari&s;on &s;hews, that there is, in this particular, much exaggera|tion; it is al&s;o evident that the effect of the degree of di&s;parity which does truly exi&s;t, is dimini&s;hed in proportion to the u&s;e which can be made of ma|chinery.</P>
<P>To illu&s;trate this la&s;t idea&mdash;Let it be &s;uppo&s;ed, that the difference of price,
<PB N="19" REF="023914_0021_0FC285B84DC859D0">
in two countries, of a given quantity of manual labor requi&s;ite to the fabrica|tion of a given article is as ten; and that &s;ome MECHANIC POWER is intro|duced into both countries, which performing half the nece&s;&s;ary labor, leaves only half to be done by hand, it is evident, that the difference in the co&s;t of the fabrication of the article in que&s;tion, in the two countries, as far as it is connected with the price of labor, will be reduced from ten to five, in con&s;e|quence of the introduction of that POWER.</P>
<P>This circum&s;tance is worthy of the mo&s;t particular attention. It dimini&s;h|es immen&s;ely one of the objections, mo&s;t &s;trenuou&s;ly urged, again&s;t the &s;ucce&s;s of manufactures in the United States.</P>
<P>To procure all &s;uch machines as are known in any part of Europe, can only require a proper provi&s;ion and due pains. The knowledge of &s;everal of the mo&s;t important of them is already po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. The preparation of them here, is in mo&s;t ca&s;es practicable on nearly equal terms. As far as they de|pend on water, &s;ome &s;uperiority of advantages may be claimed, from the un|common variety and greater cheapne&s;s of &s;ituations adapted to mill &s;eats, with which different parts of the United States abound.</P>
<P>So far as the dearne&s;s of labor may be a con&s;equence of the greatne&s;s of profits in any branch of bu&s;ine&s;s, it is no ob&s;tacle to its &s;ucce&s;s. The under|taker can afford to pay the price.</P>
<P>There are grounds to conclude that undertakers of manufactures in this country can at this time afford to pay higher wages to the workmen they may employ than are paid to &s;imilar workmen in Europe. The prices of foreign fabrics, in the markets of the United States, which will for a long time regu|late the prices of the dome&s;tic ones, may be con&s;idered as compounded of the following ingredients. The fir&s;t co&s;t of materials, including the taxes, if any, which are paid upon them where they are made; the expence of grounds, buildings, machinery and tools; the wages of the per&s;ons employed in the manufactory; the profits on the capital or &s;tock employed; the commi&s;&s;ions of agents to purcha&s;e them where they are made; the expence of tran&s;porta|tion to the United States, including in&s;urance and other incidental charges; the taxes or duties, if any, and fees of office which are paid on their exporta|tion; the taxes or duties, and fees of office which are paid on their importation.</P>
<P>As to the fir&s;t of the&s;e items, the co&s;t of materials, the advantage, upon the whole, is at pre&s;ent on the &s;ide of the United States, and the difference, in their favor, mu&s;t encrea&s;e, in proportion as a certain and exten&s;ive dome&s;tic demand &s;hall induce the proprietors of land to devote more of their attention to the production of tho&s;e materials. It ought not to e&s;cape ob&s;ervation, in a compari&s;on on this point, that &s;ome of the principal manufacturing countries of Europe are much more dependent on foreign &s;upply for the materials of their manufactures, than would be the United States, who are capable of &s;up|plying them&s;elves with a greater abundance, as well as a greater variety of the requi&s;ite materials.</P>
<P>As to the &s;econd item, the expence of grounds, buildings, machinery and tools, an equality at lea&s;t may be a&s;&s;umed; &s;ince advantages in &s;ome particulars will counterbalance temporary di&s;advantages in others.</P>
<P>As to the third item, or the article of wages, the compari&s;on certainly turns again&s;t the United States; though as before ob&s;erved, not in &s;o great a degree as is commonly &s;uppo&s;ed.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="023914_0022_0FC285C2011C5CE0">
The fourth item is alike applicable to the foreign and to the dome&s;tic ma|nufacture. It is indeed more properly a <HI>re&s;ult</HI> than a particular, to be com|pared.</P>
<P>But with re&s;pect to all the remaining items, they are alone applicable to the foreign manufacture, and in the &s;tricte&s;t &s;en&s;e extraordinaries; con&s;tituting a &s;um of extra charge on the foreign fabric, which cannot be e&s;timated at le&s;s than from 15 to 30 per cent. on the co&s;t of it at the manufactory.</P>
<P>This &s;um of extra charge may confidently be regarded as more than a counterpoi&s;e for the real difference in the price of labor; and is a &s;atisfactory proof that manufactures may pro&s;per in defiance of it in the United States.</P>
<P>To the general allegation, connected with the circum&s;tances of &s;carcity of hands and dearne&s;s of labor, that exten&s;ive manufactures can only grow out of a redundant or full population, it will be &s;ufficient, to an&s;wer generally, that the fact has been otherwi&s;e.&mdash;That the &s;ituation alledged to be an e&s;&s;ential condition of &s;ucce&s;s, has not been that of &s;everal nations, at periods when they had already attained to maturity in a variety of manufactures.</P>
<P>The &s;uppo&s;ed want of capital for the pro&s;ecution of manufactures in the United States, is the mo&s;t indefinite of the objections which are u&s;ually op|po&s;ed to it.</P>
<P>It is very difficult to pronounce any thing preci&s;e concerning the real ex|tent of the monied capital of a country, and &s;till more concerning the propor|tion which it bears to the objects that invite the employment of capital. It is not le&s;s difficult to pronounce how far the <HI>effect</HI> of any given quantity of money, as capital, or in other words, as a medium for circulating the indu&s;|try and property of a nation, may be encrea&s;ed by the very circum&s;tance of the additional motion, which is given to it by new objects of employment. That effect, like the momentum of de&s;cending bodies, may not improperly be repre&s;ented, as in a compound ratio to <HI>ma&s;s</HI> and <HI>velocity.</HI> It &s;eems pretty certain, that a given &s;um of money, in a &s;ituation, in which the quick im|pul&s;es of commercial activity were little felt, would appear inadequate to the circulation of as great a quantity of indu&s;try and property, as in one, in which their full influence was experienced.</P>
<P>It is not obvious, why the &s;ame objection might not as well be made to ex|ternal commerce as to manufactures; &s;ince it is manife&s;t that our immen&s;e tracts of land, occupied and unoccupied, are capable of giving employment to more capital than is actually be&s;towed upon them. It is certain, that the Uni|ted States offer a va&s;t field for the advantageous employment of capital, but it does not follow, that there will not be found, in one way or another, a &s;uf|ficient fund, for the &s;ucce&s;sful pro&s;ecution of any &s;pecies of indu&s;try which is likely to prove truly beneficial.</P>
<P>The following con&s;iderations are of a nature to remove all inquietude on the &s;core of want of capital.</P>
<P>The introduction of banks, as has been &s;hewn on another occa&s;ion, has a powerful tendency to extend the active capital of a country. Experience of the utility of the&s;e in&s;titutions is multiplying them in the United States. It is probable that they will be e&s;tabli&s;hed wherever they can exi&s;t with advan|tage; and wherever they can be &s;upported, if admini&s;tered with prudence, they will add new energies to all pecuniary operations.</P>

The aid of foreign capital may &s;afely, and with con&s;iderable latitude be ta|ken into calculation. Its in&s;trumentality has been long experienced in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> external commerce; and it has begun to be felt in various other modes. Not only our funds, but our agriculture and other internal improvements have been animated by it. It has already, in a few in&s;tances, extended even to our manufactures.</P>
<P>It is a well known fact, that there are parts of Europe, which have more capital, than profitable dome&s;tic objects of employment. Hence, among other proofs, the large loans continually furni&s;hed to foreign &s;tates. And it is equal|ly certain that the capital of other parts may find more profitable employ|ment in the United States, than at home. And notwith&s;tanding there are weighty inducements to prefer the employment of capital at home, even at le&s;s profit, to an inve&s;tment of it abroad, though with greater gain, yet the&s;e inducements are over-ruled, either by a deficiency of employment, or by a very material difference in profit. Both the&s;e cau&s;es operate to produce a transfer of foreign capital to the United States. 'Tis certain, that various objects in this country hold out advantages, which are with difficulty to be equalled el&s;ewhere; and under the encrea&s;ingly favorable impre&s;&s;ions, which are entertained of our government, the attractions will become more and more &s;trong. The&s;e impre&s;&s;ions will prove a rich mine of pro&s;perity to the country, if they are confirmed and &s;trengthened by the progre&s;s of our affairs. And to &s;ecure this advantage, little more is nece&s;&s;ary, than to fo&s;ter indu&s;try, and cultivate order and tranquility, at home and abroad.</P>
<P>It is not impo&s;&s;ible, that there may be per&s;ons di&s;po&s;ed to look with a jeal|ous eye on the introduction of foreign capital, as if it were an in&s;trument to deprive our own citizens of the profits of our own indu&s;try: But perhaps there never could be a more unrea&s;onable jealou&s;y. In&s;tead of being viewed as a rival, it ought to be con&s;idered as a mo&s;t valuable auxiliary; conducing to put in motion a greater quantity of productive labor, and a greater portion of u&s;eful enterpri&s;e, than could exi&s;t without it. It is at lea&s;t evident, that in a country &s;ituated like the United States, with an infinite fund of re&s;ources, yet to be unfolded, every farthing of foreign capital, which is laid out in inter|nal ameliorations, and in indu&s;trious e&s;tabli&s;hments of a permanent nature, is a precious acqui&s;ition.</P>
<P>And whatever be the objects which originally attract foreign capital, when once introduced, it may be directed towards any purpo&s;e of beneficial exertion, which is de&s;ired. And to detain it among us, there can be no expedient &s;o effectual as to enlarge the &s;phere, within which it may be u&s;efully employed: though introduced merely with views to &s;peculations in the funds, it may af|terwards be rendered &s;ub&s;ervient to the intere&s;ts of agriculture, commerce and manufactures.</P>
<P>But the attraction of foreign capital for the direct purpo&s;e of manufactures ought not to be deemed a chimerial expectation. There are already exam|ples of it, as remarked in another place. And the examples, if the di&s;po&s;ition be cultivated, can hardly fail to multiply. There are al&s;o in&s;tances of an|other kind, which &s;erve to &s;trengthen the expectation; enterpri&s;es for improv|ing the public communications, by cutting canals, opening the ob&s;tructions in rivers, and erecting bridges, have received very material aid from the &s;ame &s;ource.</P>

When the manufacturing capitali&s;t of Europe &s;hall advert to the many impor|tant advantages, which have been intimated, in the cour&s;e of this report, he can|not but perceive very powerful inducements to a transfer of him&s;elf and his capi|tal to the United States. Among the reflections, which a mo&s;t intere&s;ting pecu|liarity of &s;ituation is calculated to &s;ugge&s;t, it cannot e&s;cape his ob&s;ervation, as a circum&s;tance of moment in the calculation, that the proge&s;&s;ive population and improvement of the United States, en&s;ure a continually encrea&s;ing dome&s;tic demand for the fabrics which he &s;hall produce, not to be affected by any ex|ternal ca&s;ualties or vici&s;&s;itudes.</P>
<P>But while there are circum&s;tances &s;ufficiently &s;trong to authori&s;e a con&s;i|derable degree of reliance on the aid of foreign capital, towards the attainment of the object in view, it is &s;atisfactory to have good grounds of a&s;&s;urance, that there are dome&s;tic re&s;ources of them&s;elves adequate to it. It happens, that there is a &s;pecies of capital, actually exi&s;ting within the United States, which relieves from all inquietude on the &s;core of want of capital&mdash;This is the fund|ed debt.&mdash;</P>
<P>The effect of a funded debt, as a &s;pecies of capital, has been noticed upon a former occa&s;ion; but a more particular elucidation of the point &s;eems to be re|quired by the &s;tre&s;s which is here laid upon it&mdash;This &s;hall accordingly be at|tempted.</P>
<P>Public funds an&s;wer the purpo&s;e of capital, from the e&s;timation in which they are u&s;ually held by monied men; and con&s;equently from the ea&s;e and di&s;|patch with which they can be turned into money. This capacity of prompt con|vertibility into money cau&s;es a transfer of &s;tock to be in a great number of ca&s;es equivalent to a payment in coin&mdash;And where it does not happen to &s;uit the party who is to receive, to accept a transfer of &s;tock, the party who is to pay, is never at a lo&s;s to find el&s;ewhere a purcha&s;er of his &s;tock, who will furni&s;h him in lieu of it, with the coin of which he &s;tands in need.</P>
<P>Hence in a &s;ound and &s;ettled &s;tate of the public funds, a man po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a &s;um in them can embrace any &s;cheme of bu&s;ine&s;s, which offers, with as much confidence as if he were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of an equal &s;um in coin.</P>
<P>This operation of public funds, as capital, is too obvious to be denied; but it is objected to the idea of their operating as an <HI>augmentation</HI> of the capital of the community, that they &s;erve to occa&s;ion the <HI>de&s;truction</HI> of &s;ome other capital to an equal amount.</P>
<P>The capital which alone they can be &s;uppo&s;ed to de&s;troy, mu&s;t con&s;i&s;t of&mdash;The annual revenue, which is applied to the payment of intere&s;t on the debt, and to the gradual redemption of the principal&mdash;The amount of the coin, which is employed in circulating the funds, or, in other words, in effecting the different alienations which they undergo.</P>
<P>But the following appears to be the true and accurate view of this matter&mdash;</P>
<P>1&s;t. As to the point of the annual revenue requi&s;ite for payment of intere&s;t and redemption of principal.</P>
<P>As a determinate proportion will tend to per&s;picuity in the rea&s;oning, let it be &s;uppo&s;ed that the annual revenue to be applied, corre&s;ponding with the modification of the 6 per cent. &s;tock of the United States, is in the ratio of eight upon the hundred; that is, in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, &s;ix on account of intere&s;t, and two on account of principal.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="023914_0025_0FC285CEF2CD9998">
Thus far it is evident, that the capital de&s;troyed to the capital created, would bear no greater proportion than 8 to 10c. There would be withdrawn from the total ma&s;s of other capitals a &s;um of eight dollars to be paid to the public creditor; while he would be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a &s;um of one hundred dollars, ready to be applied to any purpo&s;e, to be embarked in any enterpri&s;e, which might appear to him eligible&mdash;Here then the <HI>augmentation</HI> of capital, or the exce&s;s of that which is produced, beyond that which is de&s;troyed, is equal to ninety-two dollars.</P>
<P>To this conclu&s;ion it may be objected, that the &s;um of eight dollars is to be withdrawn annually, until the whole hundred is extingui&s;hed, and it may be inferred, that in proce&s;s of time a capital will be de&s;troyed equal to that which is at fir&s;t created.</P>
<P>But it is neverthele&s;s true, that during the whole of the interval, between the creation of the capital of 100 dollars, and its reduction to a &s;um not greater than that of the annual revenue appropriated to its redemption&mdash;there will be a greater active capital in exi&s;tence than if no debt had been contracted. The &s;um drawn from other capitals <HI>in any one year</HI> will not exceed eight dollars; but there will be <HI>at every in&s;tant of time</HI> during the whole period in que&s;tion, a &s;um corre&s;ponding <HI>with &s;o much of the principal,</HI> as remains <HI>unredeemed,</HI> in the hands of &s;ome per&s;on or other, employed, or ready to be employed in &s;ome pro|fitable undertaking. There will therefore con&s;tantly be more capital, in ca|pacity to be employed, than capital taken from employment. The exce&s;s for the fir&s;t year has been &s;tated to be ninety-two dollars; it will dimini&s;h yearly; but there always will be an exce&s;s, until the principal of the debt is brought to a level with the REDEEMING ANNUITY; that is, in the ca&s;e which has been a&s;&s;umed by way of example, to EIGHT DOLLARS. The reality of this exce&s;s becomes palpable, if it be &s;uppo&s;ed, as often happens, that the citizen of a fo|reign country imports into the United States 100 dollars for the purcha&s;e of an equal &s;um of public debt&mdash;here is an ab&s;olute augmentation of the ma&s;s of circulating coin to the extent of 100 dollars. At the end of a year the fo|reigner is pre&s;umed to draw back eight dollars on account of his principal and intere&s;t, but he &s;till leaves, ninety-two of his original depo&s;it in circulation, as he in like manner leaves eighty-four at the end of the &s;econd year, drawing back then al&s;o the annuity of eight dollars: And thus the matter proceeds; the capital left in circulation dimini&s;hing each year, and coming nearer to the level of the annuity drawn back. There are however, &s;ome differences in the ultimate operation of the part of the debt, which is purcha&s;ed by foreigners, and that which remains in the hands of citizens. But the general effect in each ca&s;e, though in different degrees, is to add to the active capital of the country.</P>
<P>Hitherto the rea&s;oning has proceeded on a conce&s;&s;ion of the po&s;ition, that there is a de&s;truction of &s;ome other capital, to the extent of the annuity appro|priated to the payment of the intere&s;t and the redemption of the principal of the debt; but in this, too much has been conceded. There is at mo&s;t a tem|porary transfer of &s;ome other capital, to the amount of the annuity, from tho&s;e who pay to the creditor who receives; which he again re&s;tores to the circu|lation to re&s;ume the offices of a capital. This he does either immediately by employing the money in &s;ome branch of indu&s;try, or mediately by lending it to &s;ome other per&s;on, who does &s;o employ it, or by &s;pending it on his own maintenance. In either &s;uppo&s;ition, there is no de&s;truction of capital: there is nothing more than a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of its motion for a time; that is, while it is pa&s;&s;ing from the hands of tho&s;e who pay into the public coffers, and thence through the public creditor into &s;ome other channel of circulation. When the payments of intere&s;t are periodical and quick, and made by the in&s;trumen|tality
<PB N="24" REF="023914_0026_0FC285D5B148AB30">
of banks, the diver&s;ion or &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of capital may almo&s;t be denomina|ted momentary. Hence the deduction on this account is far le&s;s, than it at fir&s;t &s;ight appears to be.</P>
<P>There is evidently, as far as regards the annuity, no de&s;truction nor trans|fer of any other capital, than that portion of the income of each individual, which goes to make up the annuity. The land which furni&s;hes the farmer with the &s;um which he is to contribute remains the &s;ame; and the like may be ob&s;erved of other capitals. Indeed as far as the tax, which is the object of contribution (as frequently happens when it does not oppre&s;s by its weight) may have been a motive to <HI>greater exertion</HI> in any occupation; it may even &s;erve to encrea&s;e the contributory capital: This idea is not without importance in the general view of the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>It remains to &s;ee, what further deduction ought to be made from the capi|tal which is created, by the exi&s;tence of the debt, on account of the coin, which is employed in its circulation. This is &s;u&s;ceptible of much le&s;s preci&s;e calculation than the article which has been ju&s;t di&s;cu&s;&s;ed. It is impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ay what proportion of coin is nece&s;&s;ary to carry on the alienations which any &s;pecies of property u&s;ually undergoes. The quantity indeed varies according to circum&s;tances. But it may &s;till without he&s;itation be pronounced, from the quickne&s;s of the rotation, or rather of the tran&s;itions, that the <HI>medium</HI> of circu|lation always bears but a &s;mall proportion to the amount of the <HI>property</HI> circu|lated. And it is thence &s;atisfactorily deducible, that the coin employed in the negociations of the funds, and which &s;erves to give them activity, as capital, is incomparably le&s;s than the &s;um of the debt negociated for the purpo&s;e of bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>It ought not, however, to be omitted, that the negociation of the funds be|comes it&s;elf a di&s;tinct bu&s;ine&s;s; which employs, and by employing, diverts a portion of the circulating coin from other pur&s;uits. But making due allow|ance for this circum&s;tance, there is no rea&s;on to conclude, that the effect of the diver&s;ion of coin in the whole operation bears any con&s;iderable proportion to the amount of the capital to which it gives activity. The &s;um of the debt in circulation is continually at the command of any u&s;eful enterpri&s;e, the coin it&s;elf which circulates it, is never more than momentarily &s;u&s;pended from its ordinary functions. It experiences an ince&s;&s;ant and rapid flux and reflux to and from the channels of indu&s;try to tho&s;e of &s;peculations in the funds.</P>
<P>There are &s;trong circum&s;tances in confirmation of this theory. The force of monied capital which has been di&s;played in Great-Britain, and the height to which every &s;pecies of indu&s;try has grown up under it, defy a &s;olution from the quantity of coin which that kingdom has ever po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. Accordingly it has been coeval with its funding &s;y&s;tem, the prevailing opinion of the men of bu&s;ine&s;s, and of the generality of the mo&s;t &s;agacious theori&s;ts of that country, that the operation of the public funds as capital has contributed to the effect in que&s;tion. Among our&s;elves appearances thus far favor the &s;ame conclu&s;ion. Indu&s;try in general &s;eems to have been reanimated. There are &s;ymptoms indi|cating an exten&s;ion of our commerce. Our navigation has certainly of late had a con&s;iderable &s;pring, and there appears to be in many parts of the Union a command of capital, which, till lately, &s;ince the revolution at lea&s;t, was un|known. But it is at the &s;ame time to be acknowledged, that other circum|&s;tances have concurred (and in a great degree) in producing the pre&s;ent &s;tate of things, and that the appearances are not yet &s;ufficiently deci&s;ive to be en|tirely relied upon.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="023914_0027_0FC285D70ACFDE38">
In the que&s;tion under di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, it is important to di&s;tingui&s;h between an <HI>ab&s;olute encrea&s;e of capital, or an acce&s;&s;ion of real wealth</HI> and an <HI>artificial encrea&s;e of capital,</HI> as an engine of bu&s;ine&s;s, or as an in&s;trument of indu&s;try and com|merce. In the fir&s;t &s;en&s;e, a funded debt has no preten&s;ions to being deemed an encrea&s;e of capital; in the la&s;t, it has preten&s;ions which are not ea&s;y to be controverted. Of a &s;imilar nature is bank credit, and, in an inferior degree, every &s;pecies of private credit.</P>
<P>But though a funded debt is not in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, an ab&s;olute encrea&s;e of capital, or an augmentation of real wealth; yet by &s;erving as a new power in the operations of indu&s;try, it has within certain bounds a tendency to encrea&s;e the real wealth of a community; in like manner as money borrowed by a thrifty farmer, to be laid out in the improvement of his farm, may, in the end, add to his &s;tock of real riches.</P>
<P>There are re&s;pectable individuals, who, from a ju&s;t aver&s;ion to an accumu|lation of public debt, are unwilling to concede to it any kind of utility, who can di&s;cern no good to alleviate the ill with which they &s;uppo&s;e it pregnant; who cannot be per&s;uaded, that it ought in any &s;en&s;e to be viewed as an encrea&s;e of capital, le&s;t it &s;hould be inferred, that the more debt the more capital, the greater the burthens the greater the ble&s;&s;ings of the community.</P>
<P>But it intere&s;ts the public councils to e&s;timate every object as it truly is; to appreciate how far the good in any mea&s;ure is compen&s;ated by the ill; or the ill by the good; either of them is &s;eldom unmixed.</P>
<P>Neither will it follow, that an accumulation of debt is de&s;ireable, becau&s;e a certain degree of it operates as capital. There may be a plethora in the poli|tical, as in the natural body; there may be a &s;tate of things in which any &s;uch artificial capital is unnece&s;&s;ary. The debt too may be &s;welled to &s;uch a &s;ize, as that the greate&s;t part of it may cea&s;e to be u&s;eful as a capital, &s;erving only to pamper the di&s;&s;ipation of idle and di&s;&s;olute individuals; as that the &s;ums required to pay the intere&s;t upon it may become oppre&s;&s;ive, and beyond the means which a government can employ, con&s;i&s;tently with its tranquility, to rai&s;e them; as that the re&s;ources of taxation, to face the debt, may have been &s;trained too far to admit of exten&s;ions adequate to exigencies, which regard the public &s;afety.</P>
<P>Where this critical point is, cannot be pronounced; but it is impo&s;&s;ible to believe, that there is not &s;uch a point.</P>
<P>And as the vici&s;&s;itudes of nations beget a perpetual tendency to the accu|mulation of debt, there ought to be in every government a perpetual, anxious and uncea&s;ing effort to reduce that, which at any time exi&s;ts, as fa&s;t as &s;hall be practicable, con&s;i&s;tently with integrity and good faith.</P>
<P>Rea&s;onings on a &s;ubject comprehending ideas &s;o ab&s;tract and complex, &s;o little reducible to preci&s;e calculation as tho&s;e which enter into the que&s;tion ju&s;t di&s;cu&s;&s;ed; are always attended with a danger of running into fallacies. Due allowance ought therefore to be made for this po&s;&s;ibility&mdash;But as far as the na|ture of the &s;ubject admits of it, there appears to be &s;atisfactory ground for a belief that the public funds operate as a re&s;ource of capital to the citizens of the United States, and, if they are a re&s;ource at all, it is an exten&s;ive one.</P>

<P>There remains to be noticed an objection to the encouragement of manu|factures, of a nature different from tho&s;e which que&s;tion the probability of &s;uc|ce&s;s&mdash;This is derived from its &s;uppo&s;ed tendency to give a monopoly of ad|vantages to particular cla&s;&s;es at the expence of the re&s;t of the community, who, it is affirmed, would be able to procure the requi&s;ite &s;upplies of manu|factured articles on better terms from foreigners, than from our own citi|zens, and who, it is alledged, are reduced to a nece&s;&s;ity of paying an en|hanced price for whatever they want, by every mea&s;ure, which ob&s;tructs the free competition of foreign commodities.</P>
<P>It is not an unrea&s;onable &s;uppo&s;ition that mea&s;ures, which &s;erve to abridge the free competition of foreign articles, have a tendency to occa&s;ion an en|hancement of prices, and it is not to be denied that &s;uch is the effect in a num|ber of ca&s;es; but the fact does not uniformly corre&s;pond with the theory. A reduction of prices has in &s;everal in&s;tances immediately &s;ucceeded the e&s;tab|li&s;hment of a dome&s;tic manufacture. Whether it be that foreign manufacturers endeavor to &s;upplant, by under&s;elling our own, or whatever el&s;e be the cau&s;e, the effect has been &s;uch as is &s;tated, and the rever&s;e of what might have been expected.</P>
<P>But though it were true, that the immediate and certain effect of regula|tions controuling the competition of foreign with dome&s;tic fabrics was an en|crea&s;e of price, it is univer&s;ally true, that the contrary is the ultimate effect with every &s;ucce&s;sful manufacture. When a dome&s;tic manufacture has attained to perfection, and has engaged in the pro&s;ecution of it a competent number of per&s;ons, it invariably becomes cheaper. Being free from the heavy charges, which attend the importation of foreign commodities, it can be afforded, and accordingly &s;eldom or never fails to be &s;old cheaper, in proce&s;s of time, than was the foreign article for which it is a &s;ub&s;titute. The internal competition, which takes place, &s;oon does away every thing like monopoly, and by degrees reduces the price of the article to the <HI>minimum</HI> of a rea&s;onable profit on the ca|pital employed. This accords with the rea&s;on of the thing and with expe|rience.</P>
<P>Whence it follows, that it is the intere&s;t of a community, with a view to eventual and permanent oeconomy, to encourage the growth of manufactures. In a national view, a temporary enhancement of price mu&s;t always be well compen&s;ated by a permanent reduction of it.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="023914_0030_0FC285EA8A747BB0">
It is a reflection, which may with propriety be indulged here, that this even|tual diminution of the prices of manufactured articles, which is the re&s;ult of internal manufacturing e&s;tabli&s;hments, has a direct and very important tenden|cy to benefit agriculture. It enables the farmer, to procure with a &s;maller quantity of his labor, the manufactured produce, of which he &s;tands in need, and con&s;equently encrea&s;es the value of his income and property.</P>
<P>The objections which are commonly made to the expediency of encourag|ing and to the probability of &s;ucceeding in manufacturing pur&s;uits, in the United States, having now been di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, the con&s;iderations which have ap|peared in the cour&s;e of the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, recommending that &s;pecies of indu&s;try to the patronage of the government, will be materially &s;trengthened by a few general and &s;ome particular topics, which have been naturally re&s;erved for &s;ub&s;equent notice.</P>
<P>I. There &s;eems to be a moral certainty, that the trade of a country which is both manufacturing and agricultural, will be more lucrative and pro&s;perous, than that of a country, which is merely agricultural.</P>
<P>One rea&s;on for this is found in that general effort of nations (which has been already mentioned) to procure from their own &s;oils, the articles of prime ne|ce&s;&s;ity requi&s;ite to their own con&s;umption and u&s;e; and which &s;erves to render their demand for a foreign &s;upply of &s;uch articles in a great degree occa&s;ional and contingent. Hence, while the nece&s;&s;ities of nations exclu&s;ively devoted to agriculture, for the fabrics of manufacturing &s;tates are con&s;tant and regular, the wants of the latter for the products of the former, are liable to very con&s;ider|able fluctuations and interruptions. The great inequalities, re&s;ulting from dif|ference of &s;ea&s;ons, have been el&s;ewhere remarked: this uniformity of demand on one &s;ide, and un&s;teadine&s;s of it, on the other, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have a ten|dency to cau&s;e the general cour&s;e of the exchange of commodities between the parties, to turn to the di&s;advantage of the merely agricultural &s;tates. Peculiarity of &s;ituation, a climate and &s;oil adapted to the production of peculiar commodi|ties may, &s;ometimes, contradict the rule; but there is every rea&s;on to believe that it will be found in the main, a ju&s;t one.</P>
<P>Another circum&s;tance which gives a &s;uperiority of commercial advantages to &s;tates, that manufacture, as well as cultivate, con&s;i&s;ts in the more numerous attractions, which a more diver&s;ified market offers to foreign cu&s;tomers, and in the greater &s;cope, which it affords to mercantile enterpri&s;e. It is a po&s;ition of indi&s;putable truth in commerce, depending too on very obvious rea&s;ons, that the greate&s;t re&s;ort will ever be to tho&s;e marts, where commodities, while equally abundant, are mo&s;t various. Each difference of kind holds out an additional inducement: and it is a po&s;ition not le&s;s clear, that the field of en|terpri&s;e mu&s;t be enlarged to the merchants of a country, in proportion to the variety, as well as the abundance of commodities which they find at home for exportation to foreign markets.</P>
<P>A third circum&s;tance, perhaps not inferior to either of the other two, con|ferring the &s;uperiority which has been &s;tated, has relation to the &s;tagnations of demand for certain commodities which at &s;ome time or other interfere more or le&s;s with the &s;ale of all.&mdash;The nation which can bring to market, but few articles is likely to be more quickly and &s;en&s;ibly affected by &s;uch &s;tagnations, than one, which is always po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a great variety of commodities: the for|mer frequently finds too great a portion of its &s;tock of materials, for &s;ale or exchange, lying on hand&mdash;or is obliged to make injurious &s;acrifices to &s;upply
<PB N="29" REF="023914_0031_0FC285EC46FBA8A0">
its wants of foreign articles, which are <HI>numerous</HI> and <HI>urgent,</HI> in proportion to the &s;mallne&s;s of the number of its own. The latter commonly finds it&s;elf in|demnified, by the high prices of &s;ome articles, for the low prices of others&mdash;and the prompt and advantageous &s;ale of tho&s;e articles which are in demand enables its merchants the better to wait for a favorable change, in re&s;pect to tho&s;e which are not. There is ground to believe, that a difference of &s;itua|tion, in this particular, has immen&s;ely different effects upon the wealth and pro&s;perity of nations.</P>
<P>From the&s;e circum&s;tances collectively, two important inferences are to be drawn; one, that there is always a higher probability of a favorable balance of trade, in regard to countries, in which manufactures founded on the ba&s;is of a thriving agriculture flouri&s;h, than in regard to tho&s;e, which are confined wholly or almo&s;t wholly to agriculture; the other (which is al&s;o a con&s;equence of the fir&s;t) that countries of the former de&s;cription are likely to po&s;&s;e&s;s more pecuniary wealth, or money, than tho&s;e of the latter.</P>
<P>Facts appear to corre&s;pond with this conclu&s;ion. The importations of ma|nufactured &s;upplies &s;eem invariably to drain the merely agricultural people of their wealth. Let the &s;ituation of the manufacturing countries of Europe be compared in this particular, with that of countries which only cultivate, and the di&s;parity will be &s;triking. Other cau&s;es, it is true, help to account for this di&s;parity between &s;ome of them; and among the&s;e cau&s;es, the relative &s;tate of agriculture; but between others of them, the mo&s;t prominent circum&s;tance of di&s;&s;imilitude ari&s;es from the comparative &s;tate of manufactures. In corro|boration of the &s;ame idea, it ought not to e&s;cape remark, that the We&s;t-India i&s;lands, the &s;oils of which are the mo&s;t fertile, and the nation, which in the greate&s;t degree &s;upplies the re&s;t of the world, with the precious metals, ex|change to a lo&s;s with almo&s;t every other country.</P>
<P>As far as experience at home may guide, it will lead to the &s;ame conclu&s;ion. Previous to the revolution, the quantity of coin, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the colonies, which now compo&s;e the United States, appeared to be inadequate to their cir|culation; and their debt to Great-Britain was progre&s;&s;ive. Since the revolu|tion, the &s;tates, in which manufactures have mo&s;t encrea&s;ed, have recovered fa&s;te&s;t from the injuries of the late war; and abound mo&s;t in pecuniary re|&s;ources.</P>
<P>It ought to be admitted, however, in this as in the preceding ca&s;e, that cau&s;es irrelative to the &s;tate of manufactures account, in a degree, for the phe|nomena remarked. The continual progre&s;s of new &s;ettlements has a natural tendency to occa&s;ion an unfavorable balance of trade; though it indemnifies for the inconvenience, by that encrea&s;e of the national capital which flows from the conver&s;ion of wa&s;te into improved lands: and the different degrees of ex|ternal commerce, which are carried on by the different &s;tates, may make mate|rial differences in the comparative &s;tate of their wealth. The fir&s;t circum&s;tance has reference to the deficiency of coin and the encrea&s;e of debt previous to the revolution; the la&s;t to the advantages which the mo&s;t manufacturing &s;tates appear to have enjoyed; over the others, &s;ince the termination of the late war.</P>
<P>But the uniform appearance of an abundance of &s;pecie, as the concomitant of a flouri&s;hing &s;tate of manufactures, and of the rever&s;e, where they do not prevail, afford a &s;trong pre&s;umption of their favourable operation upon the wealth of a country.
<PB N="30" REF="023914_0032_0FC285EF6704D4A0">
Not only the wealth, but the independence and &s;ecurity of a country, appear to be materially connected with the pro&s;perity of manufactures. Every na|tion, with a view to tho&s;e great objects, ought to endeavor to po&s;&s;e&s;s within it|&s;elf all the e&s;&s;entials of national &s;upply. The&s;e compri&s;e the means of <HI>&s;ub&s;i&s;t|ence, habitation, clothing</HI> and <HI>defence.</HI></P>
<P>The po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the&s;e is nece&s;&s;ary to the perfection of the body politic, to the &s;afety as well as to the welfare of the &s;ociety; the want of either, is the want of an important organ of political life and motion; and in the various cri&s;es which await a &s;tate, it mu&s;t &s;everely feel the effects of any &s;uch deficien|cy. The extreme embarra&s;&s;ments of the United States during the late war, from an incapacity of &s;upplying them&s;elves, are &s;till matter of keen recollec|tion: a future war might be expected again to exemplify the mi&s;chiefs and dangers of a &s;ituation, to which that incapacity is &s;till in too great a degree applicable, unle&s;s changed by timely and vigorous exertions. To effect this change, as fa&s;t as &s;hall be prudent, merits all the attention and all the zeal of our public councils; 'tis the next great work to be accompli&s;hed.</P>
<P>The want of a navy to protect our external commerce, as long as it &s;hall con|tinue, mu&s;t render it a peculiarly precarious reliance, for the &s;upply of e&s;&s;en|tial articles, and mu&s;t &s;erve to &s;trengthen prodigiou&s;ly the arguments in favor of manufactures.</P>
<P>To the&s;e general con&s;iderations are added &s;ome of a more particular nature.</P>
<P>Our di&s;tance from Europe, the great fountain of manufactured &s;upply, &s;ub|jects us in the exi&s;ting &s;tate of things, to inconvenience and lo&s;s in two ways.</P>
<P>The bulkine&s;s of tho&s;e commodities which are the chief productions of the &s;oil, nece&s;&s;arily impo&s;es very heavy charges on their tran&s;portation, to di&s;tant markets. The&s;e charges, in the ca&s;es, in which the nations, to whom our pro|ducts are &s;ent, maintain a competition in the &s;upply of their own markets, prin|cipally fall upon us, and form material deductions from the primitive value of the articles furni&s;hed. The charges on manufactured &s;upplies, brought from Europe are greatly enhanced by the &s;ame circum&s;tance of di&s;tance. The&s;e charges, again, in the ca&s;es in which our own indu&s;try maintains no competi|tion, in our own markets, al&s;o principally fall upon us; and are an additional cau&s;e of extraordinary deduction from the primitive value of our own pro|ducts; the&s;e being the materials of exchange for the foreign fabrics, which we con&s;ume.</P>
<P>The equality and moderation of individual property, and the growing &s;et|tlements of new di&s;tricts, occa&s;ion, in this country an unu&s;ual demand for coar&s;e manufactures; the charges of which being greater in proportion to their greater bulk, augment the di&s;advantage, which has been ju&s;t de&s;cribed.</P>
<P>As in mo&s;t countries dome&s;tic &s;upplies maintain a very con&s;iderable compe|tition with &s;uch foreign productions of the &s;oil, as are imported for &s;ale; if the exten&s;ive e&s;tabli&s;hment of manufactories in the United States does not cre|ate a &s;imilar competition in re&s;pect to manufactured articles, it appears to be clearly deducible, from the con&s;iderations which have been mentioned, that they mu&s;t &s;u&s;tain a double lo&s;s in their exchanges with foreign nations; &s;trongly conducive to an unfavorable balance of trade, and very prejudicial to their intere&s;ts.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="023914_0033_0FC285F919B5D920">
The&s;e di&s;advantages pre&s;s with no &s;mall weight, on the landed intere&s;t of the country. In &s;ea&s;ons of peace, they cau&s;e a &s;erious deduction from the in|trin&s;ic value of the products of the &s;oil. In the time of a war, which &s;hould either involve our&s;elves, or another nation, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing a con&s;iderable &s;hare of our carrying trade, the charges on the tran&s;portation of our commodities, bul|ky as mo&s;t of them are, could hardly fail to prove a grievous burthen to the far|mer; while obliged to depend in &s;o great degree as he now does, upon foreign markets for the vent of the &s;urplus of his labor.</P>
<P>As far as the pro&s;perity of the fi&s;heries of the United States is impeded by the want of an adequate market, there ari&s;es another &s;pecial rea&s;on for de&s;i|ring the exten&s;ion of manufactures. Be&s;ides the fi&s;h, which in many places, would be likely to make a part of the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of the per&s;ons employed; it is known that the oils, bones and &s;kins of marine animals, are of exten&s;ive u&s;e in various manufactures. Hence the pro&s;pect of an additional demand for the produce of the fi&s;heries.</P>
<P>One more point of view only remains, in which to con&s;ider the expediency of encouraging manufactures in the United States.</P>
<P>It is not uncommon to meet with an opinion, that though the promoting of manufactures, may be the intere&s;t of a part of the union, it is contrary to that of another part. The northern and &s;outhern regions are &s;ometimes re|pre&s;ented as having adver&s;e intere&s;ts in this re&s;pect. Tho&s;e are called manu|facturing, the&s;e agricultural &s;tates, and a &s;pecies of oppo&s;ition is imagined to &s;ub&s;i&s;t between the manufacturing und agricultural intere&s;ts.</P>
<P>This idea of an oppo&s;ition between tho&s;e two intere&s;ts is the common error of the early periods of every country, but experience gradually di&s;&s;ipates it. Indeed they are perceived &s;o often to &s;uccour and to befriend each other, that they come at length to be con&s;idered as one; a &s;uppo&s;ition which has been frequently abu&s;ed, and is not univer&s;ally true. Particular encouragements of particular manufactures may be of a nature to &s;acrifice the intere&s;ts of land|holders to tho&s;e of manufacturers; but it is neverthele&s;s a maxim well e&s;ta|bli&s;hed by experience, and generally acknowledged, where there has been &s;uf|ficient experience, that the <HI>aggregate</HI> pro&s;perity of manufactures, and the <HI>ag|gregate</HI> pro&s;perity of agriculture are intimately connected. In the cour&s;e of the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion which has had place, various weighty con&s;iderations have been adduced operating in &s;upport of that maxim. Perhaps the &s;uperior &s;teadine&s;s of the demand of a dome&s;tic market for the &s;urplus produce of the &s;oil, is alone a convincing argument of its truth.</P>
<P>Ideas of a contrariety of intere&s;ts between the northern and &s;outhern regi|ons of the Union, are in the main as unfounded as they are mi&s;chievous. The diver&s;ity of circum&s;tances, on which &s;uch contrariety is u&s;ually predicated, authori&s;es a directly contrary conclu&s;ion. Mutual wants con&s;titute one of the &s;tronge&s;t links of political connection, and the extent of the&s;e bears a na|tural proportion to the diver&s;ity in the means of mutual &s;upply.</P>
<P>Sugge&s;tions of an oppo&s;ite complexion are ever to be deplored, as un|friendly to the &s;teady pur&s;uit of one great common cau&s;e, and to the perfect harmony of all the parts.</P>
<P>In proportion as the mind is accu&s;tomed to trace the intimate connexion of intere&s;t, which &s;ub&s;i&s;ts between all the parts of a &s;ociety, united under the
<PB N="32" REF="023914_0034_0FC285FC8C33E2D8">
<HI>&s;ame</HI> government; the infinite variety of channels which &s;erve to circulate the pro&s;perity of each to and through the re&s;t, in that proportion will it be little apt to be di&s;turbed by &s;olicitudes and apprehen&s;ions which originate in local di&s;criminations. It is a truth as important, as it is agreeable, and one to which it is not ea&s;y to imagine exceptions, that every thing tending to e&s;tabli&s;h <HI>&s;ub|&s;tantial</HI> and <HI>permanent order,</HI> in the affairs of a country, to encrea&s;e the total ma&s;s of indu&s;try and opulence, is ultimately beneficial to every part of it. On the credit of this great truth, an acquie&s;cence may &s;afely be accorded, from eve|ry quarter, to all in&s;titutions, and arrangements, which promi&s;e a confirma|tion of public order, and an augmentation of national re&s;ource.</P>
<P>But there are more particular con&s;iderations which &s;erve to fortify the idea, that the encouragement of manufactures is the intere&s;t of all parts of the Uni|on. If the northern and middle &s;tates &s;hould be the principal &s;cenes of &s;uch e&s;tabli&s;hments, they would immediately benefit the more &s;outhern, by crea|ting a demand for productions; &s;ome of which they have in common with the other &s;tates, and others of which are either peculiar to them, or more abun|dant, or of better quality, than el&s;ewhere. The&s;e productions, principally are timber, flax, hemp, cotton, wool, raw &s;ilk, indigo, iron, lead, furs, hides, &s;kins and coals; of the&s;e articles cotton and indigo are peculiar to the &s;outhern &s;tates; as are hitherto <HI>lead</HI> and <HI>coal, flax</HI> and hemp are or may be rai&s;ed in greater abundance there, than in the more northern &s;tates; and the wool of Virginia is &s;aid to be of better quality than that of any other &s;tate: a circum|&s;tance rendered the more probable by the reflection that Virginia embraces the &s;ame latitudes with the fine&s;t wool countries of Europe. The climate of the &s;outh is al&s;o better adapted to the production of &s;ilk.</P>
<P>The exten&s;ive cultivation of cotton can perhaps hardly be expected, but from the previous e&s;tabli&s;hment of dome&s;tic manufactories of the article; and the &s;ure&s;t encouragement and vent, for the others, would re&s;ult from &s;imilar e&s;tabli&s;hments in re&s;pect to them.</P>
<P>If, then, it &s;ati<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">factorily appears, that it is the intere&s;t of the United States, generally, to encourage manufactures, it merits particular attention, that there are circum&s;tances which render the pre&s;ent a critical moment for entering with zeal upon the important bu&s;ine&s;s. The effort cannot fail to be materially &s;econded by a con&s;iderable and encrea&s;ing influx of money, in con&s;equence of foreign &s;peculations in the funds&mdash;and by the di&s;orders which exi&s;t in diffe|rent parts of Europe.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t circum&s;tance not only facilitates the execution of manufacturing enterpri&s;es; but it indicates them as a nece&s;&s;ary mean to turn the thing it&s;elf to advantage, and to prevent its being eventually an evil. If u&s;eful employ|ment be not found for the money of foreigners brought to the country to be inve&s;ted in purcha&s;es of the public debt, it will quickly be re-exported to de|fray the expence of an extraordinary con&s;umption of foreign luxuries; and di&s;tre&s;&s;ing drains of our &s;pecie may hereafter be experienced to pay the intere&s;t and redeem the principal of the purcha&s;ed debt.</P>
<P>This u&s;eful employment too ought to be of a nature to produce &s;olid and permanent improvements. If the money merely &s;erves to give a temporary &s;pring to foreign commerce; as it cannot procure new and la&s;ting outlets for the products of the country; there will be no real or durable advantage gained. As far as it &s;hall find its way in agricultural ameliorations, in opening canals, and in &s;imilar improvements, it will be productive of &s;ub&s;tantial utility. But
<PB N="33" REF="023914_0035_0FC285FE1C34FA50">
there is rea&s;on to doubt, whether in &s;uch channels it is likely to find &s;ufficient employment, and &s;till more whether many of tho&s;e who po&s;&s;e&s;s it, would be as readily attracted to objects of this nature, as to manufacturing pur&s;uits; which bear greater analogy to tho&s;e to which they are accu&s;tomed, and to the &s;pirit generated by them.</P>
<P>To open the one field, as well as the other, will at lea&s;t &s;ecure a better pro&s;|pect to u&s;eful employment, for whatever acce&s;&s;ion of money there has been or may be.</P>
<P>There is at the pre&s;ent juncture a certain fermentation of mind, a certain activity of &s;peculation and enterpri&s;e, which if properly directed, may be made &s;ub&s;ervient to u&s;eful purpo&s;es; but which if left entirely to it&s;elf, may be at|tended with pernicious effects.</P>
<P>The di&s;turbed &s;tate of Europe, inclining its citizens to emigration, the re|qui&s;ite workmen, will be more ea&s;ily acquired, than at another time; and the effect of multiplying the opportunities of employment to tho&s;e who emigrate, may be an encrea&s;e of the number and extent of valuable acqui&s;itions to the population, arts and indu&s;try of the country.</P>
<P>To find plea&s;ure in the calamities of other nations would be criminal; but to benefit our&s;elves, by opening an a&s;ylum to tho&s;e who &s;uffer, in con&s;equence of them, is as ju&s;tifiable as it is politic.</P>
<P>A full view having now been taken of the inducements to the promotion of manufactures in the United States, accompanied with an examination of the prin|cipal objections which are commonly urged in <HI>oppo&s;ition,</HI> it is proper in the next place to con&s;ider the means by which it may be effected, as introductory to a &s;pecification of the objects which in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of things appear the mo&s;t fit to be encouraged, and of the particular mea&s;ures which it may be ad|vi&s;eable to adopt, in re&s;pect to each.</P>
<P>In order to a better judgment of the means proper to be re&s;orted to by the United States, it will be of u&s;e to advert to tho&s;e which have been employed with &s;ucce&s;s in other countries. The principal of the&s;e are&mdash;</P>
<P>I. <HI>Protecting duties&mdash;or duties on tho&s;e foreign articles which are the rivals of the dome&s;tic ones intended to be encouraged.</HI></P>
<P>Duties of this nature evidently amount to a virtual bounty on the dome&s;tic fabrics, &s;ince by enhancing the charges on foreign articles, they enable the na|tional manufacturers to under&s;ell all their foreign competitors. The propriety of this &s;pecies of encouragement need not be dwelt upon; as it is not only a clear re&s;ult from the numerous topics which have been &s;ugge&s;ted, but is &s;anc|tioned by the laws of the United States, in a variety of in&s;tances; it has the ad|ditional recommendation of being a re&s;ource of revenue&mdash;Indeed all the du|ties impo&s;ed on imported articles, though with an exclu&s;ive view to revenue, have the effect in contemplation, and except where they fall on raw materials wear a beneficent a&s;pect towards the manufactures of the country.</P>
<P>II. <HI>Prohibitions of rival articles, or duties equivalent to prohibitions.</HI></P>
<P>This is another and an efficacious mean of encouraging national manufac|tures, but in general it is only fit to be employed when a manufacture has made
<PB N="34" REF="023914_0036_0FC28601B6A0BDC0">
&s;uch a progre&s;s, and is in &s;o many hands as to en&s;ure a due competition, and an adequate &s;upply on rea&s;onable terms&mdash;Of duties equivalent to prohibitions, there are examples in the laws of the United States, and there are other ca&s;es to which the principle may be advantageou&s;ly extended, but they are not numerous.</P>
<P>Con&s;idering a monopoly of the dome&s;tic market to its own manufacturers as the reigning policy of manufacturing nations, a &s;imilar policy on the part of the United States in every proper in&s;tance, is dictated, it might almo&s;t be &s;aid, by the principles of di&s;tributive ju&s;tice; certainly by the duty of endeavoring to &s;ecure to their own citizens a reciprocity of advantages.</P>
<P>III. <HI>Prohibitions of the exportation of the materials of manufactures.</HI></P>
<P>The de&s;ire of &s;ecuring a cheap and plentiful &s;upply for the national workmen, and, where the article is either peculiar to the country, or of peculiar quality there, the jealou&s;y of enabling foreign workmen to rival tho&s;e of the nation, with its own materials, are the leading motives to this &s;pecies of regulation. It ought not to be affirmed, that it is in no in&s;tance proper; but it is certainly one which ought to be adopted with great circum&s;pection, and only in very plain ca&s;es. It is &s;een at once, that its immediate operation, is to abridge the de|mand and keep down the price of the produce of &s;ome other branch of in|du&s;try, generally &s;peaking, of agriculture, to the prejudice of tho&s;e who carry it on; and though if it be really e&s;&s;ential to the pro&s;perity of any very impor|tant national manufacture, it may happen that tho&s;e who are injured in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, may be eventually indemnified, by the &s;uperior &s;teadine&s;s of an ex|ten&s;ive dome&s;tic market depending on that pro&s;perity: yet in a matter, in which there is &s;o much room for nice and difficult combinations, in which &s;uch oppo&s;ite con&s;iderations combat each other, prudence &s;eems to dictate, that the expedient in que&s;tion, ought to indulged with a &s;paring hand.</P>
<P>IV. <HI>Pecuniary bounties.</HI></P>
<P>This has been found one of the mo&s;t efficacious means of encouraging ma|nufactures, and it is in &s;ome views, the be&s;t. Though it has not yet been prac|ti&s;ed upon by the government of the United States (unle&s;s the allowance on the exportation of dried and pickled fi&s;h and &s;alted meat could be con&s;idered as a bounty) and though it is le&s;s favored by public opinion than &s;ome other modes&mdash;Its advantages are the&s;e&mdash;</P>
<P N="1">1. It is a &s;pecies of encouragement more po&s;itive and direct than any other, and for that very rea&s;on, has a more immediate tendency to &s;timulate and uphold new enterpri&s;es, encrea&s;ing the chances of profit, and dimini&s;hing the ri&s;ks of lo&s;s, in the fir&s;t attempts.</P>
<P N="2">2. It avoids the inconvenience of a temporary augmentation of price, which is incident to &s;ome other modes, or it produces it to a le&s;s degree; either by making no addition to the charges on the rival foreign article, as in the ca&s;e of protecting duties, or by making a &s;maller addition. The fir&s;t happens when the fund for the bounty is derived from a different object (which may or may not encrea&s;e the price of &s;ome other article, according to the nature of that object); the &s;econd, when the fund is derived from the &s;ame or a &s;imilar object of foreign manufacture. One per cent, duty on the foreign article con|verted into a bounty on the dome&s;tic, will have an equal effect with a duty of two per cent. exclu&s;ive of &s;uch bounty; and the price of the foreign commodity
<PB N="35" REF="023914_0037_0FC286028F470E78">
is liable to be rai&s;ed, in the one ca&s;e, in the proportion of one per cent.; in the other, in that of two per cent. Indeed the bounty when drawn from another &s;ource is calculated to promote a reduction of price; becau&s;e without laying any new charge on the foreign article, it &s;erves to introduce a competition with it, and to encrea&s;e the total quantity of the article in the market.</P>
<P N="3">3. Bounties have not like high protecting duties, a tendency to produce &s;carcity. An encrea&s;e of price is not always the immediate, though, where the progre&s;s of a dome&s;tic manufacture does not counteract a ri&s;e, it is com|monly the ultimate effect of an additional duty. In the interval, between the laying of the duty and a proportional encrea&s;e of price, it may di&s;courage im|portation, by interfering with the profits to be expected from the &s;ale of the article.</P>
<P N="4">4. Bounties are &s;ometimes not only the be&s;t, but the only proper expedient, for uniting the encouragement of a new object of agriculture, with that of a new object of manufacture. It is the intere&s;t of the farmer to have the pro|duction of the raw material promoted, by counteracting the interference of the foreign material of the &s;ame kind&mdash;It is the intere&s;t of the manufacturer to have the material abundant and cheap. If prior to the dome&s;tic production of the material, in &s;ufficient quantity, to &s;upply the manufacturer on good terms, a duty be laid upon the importation of it from abroad, with a view to promote the rai&s;ing of it at home, the intere&s;t both of the farmer and manufac|turer will be di&s;&s;erved&mdash;By either de&s;troying the requi&s;ite &s;upply, or rai&s;ing the price of the article, beyond what can be afforded to be given for it, by the conductor of an infant manufacture, it is abandoned or fails, and there being no dome&s;tic manufactories to create a demand for the raw material, which is rai&s;ed by the farmer, it is in vain, that the competition of the like foreign ar|ticle, may have been de&s;troyed.</P>
<P>It cannot e&s;cape notice, that a duty upon the importation of an article can no otherwi&s;e aid the dome&s;tic production of it, than by giving the latter great|er advantages in the home market. It can have no influence upon the advan|tageous &s;ale of the article produced, in foreign markets; no tendency, there|fore, to promote its exportation.</P>
<P>The true way to conciliate the&s;e two intere&s;ts, is to lay a duty on foreign <HI>ma|nufactures</HI> of the material, the growth of which is de&s;ired to be encouraged, and to apply the produce of that duty by way of bounty, either upon the production of the material it&s;elf, or upon its manufacture at home, or upon both. In this di&s;po&s;ition of the thing, the manufacturer commences his enterpri&s;e, under every advantage, which is attainable, as to quantity or price of the raw mate|rial: And the farmer, if the bounty be immediately to him, is enabled by it to enter into a &s;ucce&s;sful competition with the foreign material; if the bounty be to the manufacturer on &s;o much of the dome&s;tic material as he con&s;umes, the operation is nearly the &s;ame; he has a motive of intere&s;t to prefer the do|me&s;tic commodity, if of equal quality, even at a higher price than the fo|reign, &s;o long as the difference of price is any thing &s;hort of the bounty, which is allowed upon the article.</P>
<P>Except the &s;imple and ordinary kinds of hou&s;ehold manufacture, or tho&s;e for which there are very commanding local advantages, pecuniary bounties are in mo&s;t ca&s;es indi&s;pen&s;able to the introduction of a new branch. A &s;timulus and a &s;upport not le&s;s powerful and direct is, generally &s;peaking, e&s;&s;ential to the overcoming of the ob&s;tacles which ari&s;e from the competitions of &s;uperior
<PB N="36" REF="023914_0038_0FC2860CAC832828">
&s;kill and maturity el&s;ewhere. Bounties are e&s;pecially e&s;&s;ential, in regard to articles, upon which tho&s;e foreigners who have been accu&s;tomed to &s;upply a country are in the practice of granting them.</P>
<P>The continuance of bounties on manufactures long e&s;tabli&s;hed, mu&s;t almo&s;t always be of que&s;tionable policy: Becau&s;e a pre&s;umption would ari&s;e in every &s;uch ca&s;e, that there were natural and inherent impediments to &s;ucce&s;s. But in new undertakings, they are as ju&s;tifiable, as they are oftentimes nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>There is a degree of prejudice again&s;t bounties from an appearance of giv|ing away the public money, without an immediate con&s;ideration, and from a &s;uppo&s;ition, that they &s;erve to enrich particular cla&s;&s;es, at the expence of the community.</P>
<P>But neither of the&s;e &s;ources of di&s;like will bear a &s;erious examination. There is no purpo&s;e to which public money can be more beneficially applied, than to the acqui&s;ition of a new and u&s;eful branch of indu&s;try; no con&s;idera|tion more valuable than a permanent addition to the general &s;tock of produc|tive labor.</P>
<P>As to the &s;econd &s;ource of objection, it equally lies again&s;t other modes of encouragement which are admitted to be eligible. As often as a duty upon a foreign article makes an addition to its price, it cau&s;es an extra expence to the community, for the benefit of the dome&s;tic manufacturer. A bounty does no more. But it is the intere&s;t of the &s;ociety in each ca&s;e to &s;ubmit to a temporary expence, which is more than compen&s;ated, by an encrea&s;e of indu&s;try and wealth, by an augmentation of re&s;ources and independence; and by the cir|cum&s;tance of eventual cheapne&s;s, which has been noticed in another place.</P>
<P>It would de&s;erve attention, however, in the employment of this &s;pecies of encouragement in the United States, as a rea&s;on for moderating the degree of it in the in&s;tances in which it might be deemed eligible, that the great di&s;tance of this country from Europe impo&s;es very heavy charges on all the fabrics which are brought from thence, amounting from 15 to 30 per cent. on their value, according to their bulk.</P>
<P>A que&s;tion has been made concerning the con&s;titutional right of the govern|ment of the United States to apply this &s;pecies of encouragement, but there is certainly no good foundation for &s;uch a que&s;tion. The National Legi&s;lature has expre&s;s authority "To lay and collect taxes, duties, impo&s;ts, and exci&s;es, to pay the debts and provide for the <HI>common defence</HI> and <HI>general welfare,</HI>" with no other qualifications than that "all duties, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="5 letters">s, and exci&s;es, &s;hall be <HI>uni|form</HI> throughout the United States, that no capita<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> on or other direct tax &s;hall be laid unle&s;s in proportion to numbers a&s;certained by a cen&s;us or enumeration taken on the principles pre&s;cribed in the Con&s;titution, and that "no tax or duty &s;hall be laid on articles exported from any &s;ta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">"</P>
<P>The&s;e three qualifications excepted, the power to <HI>rai&s;e money</HI> is <HI>plenary</HI> and <HI>indefinite;</HI> and the objects to which it may be <HI>appropriated</HI> are no le&s;s compre|hen&s;ive, than the payment of the public debts and the providing for the com|mon defence and <HI>general welfare.</HI> The terms "<HI>general welfare</HI>" were doubt|le&s;s intended to &s;ignify more than was expre&s;&s;ed or imported in tho&s;e which preceded; otherwi&s;e numerous exigencies incident to the affairs of a nation would have been left without a provi&s;ion.&mdash;The phra&s;e is as comprehen&s;ive as any that could have been u&s;ed, becau&s;e it was not fit that the con&s;titutional authority of the Union, to appropriate its revenues &s;hould have been re&s;tricted
<PB N="37" REF="023914_0039_0FC28612034CD940">
within narrower limits than the "general welfare;" and becau&s;e this nece&s;&s;ari|ly embraces a va&s;t variety of particulars, which are &s;u&s;ceptible neither of &s;pe|cification nor of definition.</P>
<P>It is therefore of nece&s;&s;ity left to the di&s;cretion of the National Legi&s;lature, to pronounce, upon the objects, which concern the general welfare, and for which, under that de&s;cription, an appropriation of money is requi&s;ite and pro|per.&mdash;And there &s;eems to be no room for a doubt that whatever concerns the general intere&s;ts of LEARNING, of AGRICULTURE, of MANUFACTURES, and of COMMERCE, are within the &s;phere of the National Councils, <HI>as for as regards an application of money.</HI></P>
<P>The only qualification of the generality of the phra&s;e in que&s;tion, which &s;eems to be admi&s;&s;ible, is this&mdash;That the object to which an appropriation of money is to be made be <HI>general</HI> and not <HI>local;</HI> its operation extending in fact, or by po&s;&s;ibility throughout the Union, and not being confined to a particular &s;pot.</P>
<P>No objection ought to ari&s;e to this con&s;truction from a &s;uppo&s;ition that it would imply a power to do whatever el&s;e &s;hould appear to Congre&s;s conducive to the general welfare. A power to appropriate money with this latitude, which is granted too in <HI>expre&s;s terms,</HI> would not carry a power to do any other thing, not authori&s;ed in the Con&s;titution, either expre&s;sly or by fair implication.</P>
<P>V. <HI>Premiums.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e are of a nature allied to bounties, though di&s;tingui&s;hable from them in &s;ome important features.</P>
<P>Bounties are applicable to the whole quantity of an article produced or manu|factured, or exported, and involve a corre&s;pondent expence&mdash;Premiums &s;erve to reward &s;ome particular excellence or &s;uperiority, &s;ome extraordinary exer|tion or &s;kill, and are di&s;pen&s;ed only in a &s;mall number of ca&s;es: But their effect is to &s;timulate general effort&mdash;contrived &s;o as to be both honorary and lucrative, they addre&s;s them&s;elves to different pa&s;&s;ions; touching the chords as well of emulation as of intere&s;t.&mdash;They are accordingly a very economical mean of exciting the enterpri&s;e of a whole community.</P>
<P>There are various &s;ocieties in different countries, who&s;e object is the di&s;|pen&s;ation of premiums for the encouragement of <HI>agriculture, arts, manufactures,</HI> and <HI>commerce;</HI> and though they are for the mo&s;t part voluntary a&s;&s;ociations, with comparatively &s;lender funds, their utility has been immen&s;e. Much has been done by this mean in Great Britain: Scotland in particular owes materi|ally to it a prodigious amelioration of condition. From a &s;imilar e&s;tabli&s;hment in the United States, &s;upplied and &s;upported by the Government of the Union, va&s;t benefits might rea&s;onably be expected.&mdash;Some further ideas on this head, &s;hall accordingly be &s;ubmitted, in the conclu&s;ion of this report.</P>
<P>VI. <HI>The exemption of the materials of manufactures from duty.</HI></P>
<P>The policy of that exemption as a general rule, particularly in reference to new e&s;tabli&s;hments, is obvious. It can hardly ever be advi&s;eable to add the ob&s;tructions of fi&s;cal burthens to the difficulties which naturally embarra&s;s a new manufacture; and where it is matured and in condition to become an
<PB N="38" REF="023914_0040_0FC28613176EEAA8">
object of revenue, it is generally &s;peaking better that the fabric, than the ma|terial, &s;hould be the &s;ubject of taxation.&mdash;Ideas of proportion between the quantum of the tax and the value of the article, can be more ea&s;ily adju&s;ted in the former than in the latter ca&s;e. An argument for exemptions of this kind in the United States, is to be derived from the practice, as far as their nece&s;&s;ities have permitted, of tho&s;e nations whom we are to meet as compe|titors in our own and in foreign markets.</P>
<P>There are however exceptions to it; of which &s;ome examples will be given under the next head.</P>
<P>The laws of the Union afford in&s;tances of the ob&s;ervance of the policy here recommended, but it will probably be found advi&s;eable to extend it to &s;ome other ca&s;es&mdash;Of a nature, bearing &s;ome affinity to that policy, is the regulation which exempts from duty the tools and implements, as well as the books, clothes and hou&s;ehold furniture of foreign arti&s;ts, who come to re&s;ide in the United States; an advantage already &s;ecured to them by the laws of the Union, and which, it is, in every view, proper to continue.</P>
<P>VII. <HI>Drawbacks of the duties which are impo&s;ed on the materials of manufactures.</HI></P>
<P>It has already been ob&s;erved as a general rule, that duties on tho&s;e materi|als, ought with certain exceptions to be foreborne. Of the&s;e exceptions, three ca&s;es occur, which may &s;erve as examples&mdash;One, where the material is it&s;elf an object of general or exten&s;ive con&s;umption, and a fit and productive &s;ource of revenue&mdash;Another, where a manufacture of a &s;impler kind, the competition of which with a like dome&s;tic article is de&s;ired to be re&s;trained, partakes of the nature of a raw material, from being capable, by a further proce&s;s to be con|verted into a manufacture of a different kind, the introduction or growth of which is de&s;ired to be encouraged&mdash;A third, where the material it&s;elf is a pro|duction of the country, and in &s;ufficient abundance to furni&s;h a cheap and plen|tiful &s;upply to the national manufacturers.</P>
<P>Under the fir&s;t de&s;cription comes the article of mola&s;&s;es. It is not only a fair object of revenue, but being a &s;weet, it is ju&s;t that the con&s;umers of it &s;hould pay a duty as well as the con&s;umers of &s;ugar.</P>
<P>Cottons and linen in their white &s;tate fall under the &s;econd de&s;cription&mdash;A du|ty upon &s;uch as are imported is proper to promote the dome&s;tic manufacture of &s;imilar articles in the &s;ame &s;tate&mdash;a drawback of that duty is proper to encou|rage the printing and &s;taining at home of tho&s;e which are brought from abroad. When the fir&s;t of the&s;e manufactures has attained &s;ufficient maturity in a coun|try, to furni&s;h a full &s;upply for the &s;econd, the utility of the drawback cea&s;es.</P>
<P>The article of hemp either now does or may be expected &s;oon to exemplify the third ca&s;e, in the United States.</P>
<P>Where duties on the materials of manufactures are not laid for the purpo&s;e of preventing a competition with &s;ome dome&s;tic production, the &s;ame rea&s;ons which recommend, as a general rule, the exemption of tho&s;e materials from duties, would recommend as a like general rule, the allowance of drawbacks, in favor of the manufacturer: Accordingly, &s;uch drawbacks are familiar in countries which sy&s;tematically pur&s;ue the bu&s;ine&s;s of manufactures; which fur|ni&s;hes an argument for the ob&s;ervance of a &s;imilar policy in the United States; and the idea has been adopted by the laws of the Union, in the in&s;tances of &s;alt
<PB N="39" REF="023914_0041_0FC28616D2CEBE38">
and mola&s;&s;es. It is believed that it will be found advantageous to extend it to &s;ome other articles.</P>
<P>VIII. <HI>The encouragement of now inventions and di&s;coveries, at home, and of the introduction into the United States of &s;uch as may have been made in other countries; particularly tho&s;e which relate to machinery.</HI></P>
<P>This is among &s;he mo&s;t u&s;eful and unexceptionable of the aids which can be given to manufactures. The u&s;ual means of that encouragement are pecuniary rewards, and, for a time, exclu&s;ive privileges. The fir&s;t mu&s;t be employed, accor|ding to the occa&s;ion, and the utility of the invention, or di&s;covery. For the la&s;t, &s;o far as re&s;pects "authors and inventors," provi&s;ion has been made by law. But it is de&s;ireable in regard to improvements and &s;ecrets, of extraordinary value, to be able to extend the &s;ame benefit to introducers, as well as authors and in|ventors; a policy which has been practi&s;ed with advantage in other countries. Here, however, as in &s;ome other ca&s;es, there is cau&s;e to regret, that the compe|tency of the authority of the National Government to the <HI>good,</HI> which might be done, is not without a que&s;tion. Many aids might be given to indu&s;try; many internal improvements of primary magnitude might be promoted, by an autho|rity operating throughout the Union, which cannot be effected, as well, if at all, by an authority confined within the limits of a &s;ingle &s;tate.</P>
<P>But if the Legi&s;lature of the Union cannot do all the good that might be wi&s;hed, it is at lea&s;t de&s;ireable, that all may be done which is practicable. Means for promoting the introduction of foreign improvements, though le&s;s effica|ciou&s;ly than might be accompli&s;hed with more adequate authority, will form a part of the plan intended to be &s;ubmitted in the clo&s;e of this report.</P>
<P>It is cu&s;tomary with manufacturing nations to prohibit, under &s;evere penalties, the exportation of implements and machines, which they have either invented or improved. There are already objects for a &s;imilar regulation in the United States; and others may be expected to occur from time to time. The adoption of it &s;eems to be dictated by the principle of reciprocity. Greater li|berality, in &s;uch re&s;pects might better comport with the general &s;pirit of the country; but a &s;elfi&s;h and exclu&s;ive policy in other quarters will not alway per|mit the free indulgence of a &s;pirit, which would place us upon an unequal foot|ing. As far as prohibitions tend to prevent foreign competitors from deriving the benefit of the improvements made at home, they tend to encrea&s;e the ad|vantages of tho&s;e by whom they may have been introduced; and operate as an encouragement to exertion.</P>
<P>IX. <HI>Judicious regulations for the in&s;pection of manufactured commodities.</HI></P>
<P>This is not among the lea&s;t important of the means, by which &s;he pro&s;perity of manufactures may be promoted. It is indeed in many ca&s;es one of the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential. Contributing to prevent frauds upon con&s;umers at home, and ex|porters to foreign countries&mdash;to improve the quality and pre&s;erve the character of the national manufactures, it cannot fail to aid the expeditious and advan|tageous &s;ale of them, and to &s;erve as a guard again&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful competition from other quarters. The reputation of the flour and lumber of &s;ome &s;tates, and of the pota&s;h of others, has been e&s;tabli&s;hed by an attention to this point. And the like good name might be procured for tho&s;e articles, where&s;oever produced, by a judicious and uniform &s;y&s;tem of in&s;pection, throughout the ports of the United States. A like &s;y&s;tem might al&s;o be extended with advantage to other commodities.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="023914_0042_0FC286188ECAAAB8">
X. <HI>The facilitating of pecuniary remittances from place to place</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>Is a point of con&s;iderable moment to trade in general, and to manufactures in particular; by rendering more ea&s;y the purcha&s;e of raw materials and pro|vi&s;ions, and the payment for manufactured &s;upplies. A general circulation of bank paper, which is to be expected from the in&s;titution lately e&s;tabli&s;hed will be a mo&s;t valuable mean to this end. But much good would al&s;o accrue from &s;ome additional provi&s;ions re&s;pecting inland bills of exchange. If tho&s;e drawn in one &s;tate payable in another were made negotiable, every where, and inte|re&s;t and damages allowed in ca&s;e of prote&s;t, it would greatly promote nego|tiations between the citizens of different &s;tates, by rendering them more &s;ecure; and, with it the convenience and advantage of the merchants and manufac|turers of each.</P>
<P>XI. <HI>The facilitating of the tran&s;portation of commodities.</HI></P>
<P>Improvements favoring this object intimately concern all the dome&s;tic in|tere&s;ts of a community; but they may without impropriety be mentioned as having an important relation to manufactures. There is perhaps &s;carcely any thing, which has been better calculated to a&s;&s;i&s;t the manufactures of Great-Britain, than the ameliorations of the public roads of that kingdom, and the great progre&s;s which has been of late made in opening canals. Of the former, the United States &s;tand much in need; for the latter they pre&s;ent uncommon facilities.</P>
<P>The &s;ymptoms of attention to the improvement of inland navigation, which have lately appeared in &s;ome quarters, mu&s;t fill with plea&s;ure every brea&s;t warmed with a true zeal for the pro&s;perity of the country. The&s;e examples, it is to be hoped, will &s;timulate the exertions of the government and citizens of every &s;tate. There can certainly be no object, more worthy of the cares of the local admini&s;trations; and it were to be wi&s;hed, that there was no doubt of the power of the national government to lend its direct aid, on a compre|hen&s;ive plan. This is one of tho&s;e improvements, which could be pro&s;ecuted with more efficacy by the whole, than by any part or parts of the Union. There are ca&s;es in which the general intere&s;t will be in danger to be &s;acrificed to the colli&s;ion of &s;ome &s;uppo&s;ed local intere&s;ts. Jealou&s;ies, in matters of this kind, are as apt to exi&s;t, as they are apt to be erroneous.</P>
<P>The following remarks are &s;ufficiently judicious and pertinent to de&s;erve a literal quotation: "Good roads, canals and navigable rivers, by dimini&s;hing the expence of carriage, put the <HI>remote parts of a country</HI> more nearly upon a level with tho&s;e in the neighborhood of the town. They are <HI>upon that account</HI> the greate&s;t of all improvements. They encourage the cultivation of the re|mote, which mu&s;t always be the mo&s;t exten&s;ive circle of the country. They are advantageous to the town by breaking down the monopoly of the country in its neighborhood. They are advantageous <HI>even to that part of the country.</HI> Though they introduce &s;ome rival commodities into the old market, they open many new markets to its produce. Monopoly be&s;ides is a great enemy to good management, which can never be univer&s;ally e&s;tabli&s;hed, but in con&s;equence of that free and univer&s;al competition, which forces every body to have recour&s;e to it for the &s;ake of &s;elf defence. It is not more than fifty years ago that <HI>&s;ome of the counties in the neighborhood of London petitioned the Parliament, again&s;t the exten&s;ion of the turn-pike roads, into the remoter counties. Tho&s;e remoter coun|ties, they pretended, from the cheapne&s;s of labor, would be able to &s;ell their gra&s;s and corn cheaper in the London market, than them&s;elves, and they would thereby reduce

<P>Specimens of a &s;pirit, &s;imilar to that which governed the counties here &s;poken of pre&s;ent them&s;elves too frequently, to the eye of an impartial ob|&s;erver, and render it a wi&s;h of patrioti&s;m that the body in this country, in who&s;e councils a local or partial &s;pirit is lea&s;t likely to predominate, were at liberty to pur&s;ue and promote the general intere&s;t, in tho&s;e in&s;tances, in which there might be danger of the interference of &s;uch a &s;pirit.</P>
<P>The foregoing are the principal of the means, by which the growth of manufactures is ordinarily promoted. It is, however, not merely nece&s;&s;ary, that the mea&s;ures of government, which have a direct view to manufactures, &s;hould be calculated to a&s;&s;i&s;t and protect them, but that tho&s;e which only col|terally affect them, in the general cour&s;e of the admini&s;tration, &s;hould be guarded from any peculiar tendency to injure them.</P>
<P>There are certain &s;pecies of taxes, which are apt to be oppre&s;&s;ive to different parts of the community, and among other ill effects have a very unfriendly a&s;pect towards manufactures. All poll or capitation taxes are of this nature. They either proceed, according to a fixed rate, which operates unequally, and injuriou&s;ly to the indu&s;trious poor; or they ve&s;t a di&s;cretion in certain officers, to make e&s;timates and a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ments which are nece&s;&s;arily vague, con|jectural and liable to abu&s;e. They ought therefore to be ab&s;tained from, in all but ca&s;es of di&s;tre&s;&s;ing emergency.</P>
<P>All &s;uch taxes (including all taxes on occupations) which proceed accor|ding to the amount of capital <HI>&s;uppo&s;ed</HI> to be employed in a bu&s;ine&s;s, or of pro|fits <HI>&s;uppo&s;ed</HI> to be made in it are unavoidably hurtful to indu&s;try. It is in vain, that the evil may be endeavored to be mitigated by leaving it, in the fir&s;t in|&s;tance, in the option of the party to be taxed, to declare the amount of his ca|pital or profits.</P>
<P>Men engaged in any trade or bu&s;ine&s;s have commonly weighty rea&s;ons to avoid di&s;clo&s;ures, which would expo&s;e, with any thing like accuracy, the real &s;tate to avail them&s;elves of &s;o inconvenient a refuge. And the con&s;equence is, that they often &s;uffer oppre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>When the di&s;clo&s;ure too, if made, is not definitive, but controulable by the di&s;cretion, or in other words, by the pa&s;&s;ions and prejudices of the revenue officers, it is not only an ineffectual protection, but the po&s;&s;ibility of its being &s;o is an additional rea&s;on for not re&s;orting to it.</P>
<P>Allowing to the public officers the mo&s;t equitable di&s;po&s;itions; yet where they are to exerci&s;e a di&s;cretion, without certain data, they cannot fail to be often mi&s;led by appearances. The quantity of bu&s;ine&s;s, which &s;eems to be going on, is, in a va&s;t number of ca&s;es, a very deceitful criterion of the profits which are made; yet it is perhaps the be&s;t they can have, and it is the one, on which they will mo&s;t naturally rely. A bu&s;ine&s;s therefore which may ra|ther require aid, from the government, than be in a capacity to be contribu|tory to it, may find it&s;elf cru&s;hed by the mi&s;taken conjectures of the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of taxes.</P>

<HEAD>IRON.</HEAD>
<P>The manufactures of this article are entitled to pre-eminent rank&mdash;None are more e&s;&s;ential in their kinds, nor &s;o exten&s;ive in their u&s;es. They con|&s;titute in whole or in part the implements or the materials, or both, of almo&s;t every u&s;eful occupation. Their in&s;trumentality is every where con&s;picuous.</P>
<P>It is fortunate for the United States that they have peculiar advantages for deriving the full benefit of this mo&s;t valuable material, and they have every motive to improve it, with &s;y&s;tematic care. It is to be found in various parts of the United States, in great abundance and of almo&s;t every quality; and fuel the chief in&s;trument in manufacturing it, is both cheap and plenty.&mdash;This particularly applies to charcoal; but there are productive coal mines already in operation, and &s;trong indications, that the material is to be found in abun|dance, in a variety of other places.</P>
<P>The enquiries to which the &s;ubject of this report has led have been an|&s;wered with proofs that manufactories of iron, though generally under&s;tood to be exten&s;ive, are far more &s;o than is commonly &s;uppo&s;ed. The kinds, in which the greate&s;t progre&s;s has been made, have been mentioned in another place, and need not be repeated; but there is little doubt that every other kind, with due cultivation, will rapidly &s;ucceed. It is worthy of remark that &s;everal of
<PB N="43" REF="023914_0045_0FC28625D5B27568">
the particular trades, of which it is the ba&s;is, are capable of being carried on without the aid of large capitals.</P>
<P>Iron works have very greatly encrea&s;ed in the United States, and are pro|&s;ecuted with much more advantages than formerly. The average price before the revolution was about &s;ixty-four dollars per ton, at pre&s;ent it is about eighty; a ri&s;e which is chiefly to be attributed to the encrea&s;e of manufactures of the material.</P>
<P>The &s;till further exten&s;ion and multiplication of &s;uch manufactures will have the double effect of promoting the extraction of the metal it&s;elf, and of con|verting it to a greater number of profitable purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e manufactures too unite in a greater degree, than almo&s;t any others, the &s;everal requi&s;ites, which have been mentioned, as proper to be con&s;ulted in the &s;election of objects.</P>
<P>The only further encouragement of manufactories of this article, the pro|priety of which may be con&s;idered as unque&s;tionable, &s;eems to be an encrea&s;e of the duties on foreign rival commodities.</P>
<P>Steel is a branch which has already made a con&s;iderable progre&s;s, and it is a&s;certained that &s;ome new enterprizes, on a more exten&s;ive &s;cale, have been lately &s;et on foot. The facility of carrying it to an extent, which will &s;upply all internal demands, and furni&s;h a con&s;iderable &s;urplus for exportation can|not be doubted. The duty upon the importation of this article, which is at pre&s;ent &s;eventy-five cents per cwt. may, it is conceived, be &s;afely and advanta|geou&s;ly extended to 100 cents. It is de&s;irable, by deci&s;ive arrangements, to &s;econd the efforts, which are making in &s;o very valuable a branch.</P>
<P>The United States already in a great mea&s;ure &s;upply them&s;elves with nails and &s;pikes. They are able, and ought certainly to do it entirely. The fir&s;t and mo&s;t laborious operation, in this manufacture, is performed by water-mills; and of the per&s;ons afterwards employed a great proportion are boys, who&s;e early habits of indu&s;try are of importance to the community, to the pre&s;ent &s;upport of their families, and to their own future comfort. It is not le&s;s curi|ous than true, that in certain parts of the country, the making of nails is an occa&s;ional family manufacture.</P>
<P>The expediency of an additional duty on the&s;e articles is indicated by an important fact. About 1,800,000 pounds of them were imported into the United States in the cour&s;e of a year, ending the 30th of September, 1790. A duty of two cents per pound would, it is pre&s;umable, &s;peedily put an end to &s;o con&s;iderable an importation. And it is in every view proper that an end &s;hould be put to it.</P>
<P>The manufacture of the&s;e articles, like that of &s;ome others, &s;uffers from the carele&s;&s;ne&s;s and di&s;hone&s;ty of a part of tho&s;e who carry it on. An in&s;pection in certain ca&s;es might tend to correct the evil. It will de&s;erve con&s;ideration whether a regulation of this &s;ort cannot be applied, without inconvenience, to the exportation of the articles either to foreign countries, or from one &s;tate to another.</P>
<P>The implements of hu&s;bandry are made in &s;everal &s;tates in great abun|dance. In many places it is done by the common black&s;miths. And there
<PB N="44" REF="023914_0046_0FC28627B91C21E8">
is no doubt that an ample &s;upply for the whole country can with great ea&s;e be procured among our&s;elves.</P>
<P>Various kinds of edged tools for the u&s;e of mechanics are al&s;o made; and a con&s;iderable quantity of hollow wares; though the bu&s;ine&s;s of ca&s;tings has not yet attained the perfection which might be wi&s;hed. It is however improv|ing, and as there are re&s;pectable capitals in good hands, embarked in the pro|&s;ecution of tho&s;e branches of iron manufactories, which are yet in their in|fancy, they may all be contemplated as objects not difficult to be acquired.</P>
<P>To en&s;ure the end, it &s;eems equally &s;afe and prudent to extend the duty ad|valorem upon all manufactures of iron, or of which iron is the article of chief value, to ten per cent.</P>
<P>Fire arms and other military weapons may it is conceived, be placed without inconvenience in the cla&s;s of articles rated at fifteen per cent. There exi&s;t al|ready manufactories of the&s;e articles, which only require the &s;timulus of a cer|tain demand to render them adequate to the &s;upply of the United States.</P>
<P>It would al&s;o be a material aid to manufactories of this nature, as well as a mean of public &s;ecurity, if provi&s;ion &s;hould be made for an annual purcha&s;e of military weapons, of home manufacture to a certain determinate extent, in order to the formation of ar&s;enals; and to replace from time to time &s;uch as &s;hould be withdrawn for u&s;e, &s;o as always to have in &s;tore the quantity of each kind, which &s;hould be deemed a competent &s;upply.</P>
<P>But it may hereafter de&s;erve legi&s;lative con&s;ideration, whether manufactories of all the nece&s;&s;ary weapons of war ought not to be e&s;tabli&s;hed, on account of government it&s;elf. Such e&s;tabli&s;hments are agreeable to the u&s;ual practice of nations, and that practice &s;eems founded on &s;ufficient rea&s;on.</P>
<P>There appears to be an improvidence, in leaving the&s;e e&s;&s;ential in&s;truments of national defence to the ca&s;ual &s;peculations of individual adventure; a re|&s;ource which can le&s;s be relied upon, in this ca&s;e than in mo&s;t others; the ar|ticles in que&s;tion not being objects of ordinary and indi&s;pen&s;able private con|&s;umption or u&s;e. As a general rule, manufactories on the immediate account of government are to be avoided; but this &s;eems to be one of the few excep|tions, which that rule admits, depending on very &s;pecial rea&s;ons.</P>
<P>Manufactures of &s;teel, generally, or of which &s;teel is the article of chief va|lue, may with advantage be placed in the cla&s;s of goods rated at &s;even and an half per cent. As manufactures of this kind have not yet made any con&s;idera|ble progre&s;s, it is a rea&s;on for not rating them as high as tho&s;e of iron; but as this material is the ba&s;is of them, and as their exten&s;ion is not le&s;s practicable, than important, it is de&s;irable to promote it by a &s;omewhat higher duty than the pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>A que&s;tion ari&s;es, how far it might be expedient to permit the importation o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> iron in pigs and bars free from duty. It would certainly be favorable to manufacturers of the article; but the doubt is whether it might not interfere with its production.</P>
<P>Two circum&s;tances, however, abate if they do not remove apprehen&s;ion, on this &s;core; one is, the con&s;iderable encrea&s;e of price, which has been already remarked, and which renders it probable that the free admi&s;&s;ion of foreign
<PB N="45" REF="023914_0047_0FC286319D8042E8">
iron would not be incon&s;i&s;tent with an adequate profit to the proprietors of iron works; the other is, the augmentation of demand, which would be likely to attend the encrea&s;e of manufactures of the article, in con&s;equence of the ad|ditional encouragements propo&s;ed to be given. But caution neverthele&s;s in a matter of this kind is mo&s;t advi&s;eable. The mea&s;ure &s;ugge&s;ted ought perhaps rather to be contemplated, &s;ubject to the lights of further experience, than im|mediately adopted.</P>

<P>The manufactures of which this article is &s;u&s;ceptible are al&s;o of great ex|tent and utility. Under this de&s;cription, tho&s;e of bra&s;s, of which it is the principal ingredient, are intended to be included.</P>
<P>The material is a natural production of the country. Mines of copper have actually been wrought, and with profit to the undertakers, thought it is not known, that any are now in this condition. And nothing is ea&s;ier, than the introduction of it, from other countries, on moderate terms, and in great plenty.</P>
<P>Copper&s;miths and bra&s;s founders, particularly the former, are numerous in the United States; &s;ome of whom carry on bu&s;ine&s;s to a re&s;pectable extent.</P>
<P>To multiply and extend manufactories of the materials in que&s;tion is wor|thy of attention and effort. In order to this, it is de&s;irable to facilitate a plentiful &s;upply of the materials. And a proper mean to this end is to place them in the cla&s;s of free articles. Copper in plates and bra&s;s are already in this predicament; but copper in pigs and bars is not; neither is <HI>lapis cala|minaris,</HI> which together with <HI>copper</HI> and <HI>charcoal,</HI> con&s;titute the component ingredients of bra&s;s. The exemption from duty, by parity of rea&s;on, ought to embrace all &s;uch of the&s;e articles, as are objects of importation.</P>
<P>An additional duty, on bra&s;s wares, will tend to the general end in view. The&s;e now &s;tand at five per cent. while tho&s;e of tin, pewter and copper are rated at &s;even and an half. There appears to be a propriety in every view in placing bra&s;s wares upon the &s;ame level with them; and it merits con&s;idera|tion whether the duty upon all of them ought not to be rai&s;ed to ten per cent.</P>

<P>There are numerous proofs, that this material abounds in the United States, and requires little to unfold it to an extent, more than equal to every dome&s;tic occa&s;ion.

This is now in the hands of individuals, who not only carry it on with &s;pirit, but have e&s;tabli&s;hed manu|factories of it, at Richmond, in the &s;ame &s;tate.</P>
<P>The duties, already laid upon the importation of this article, either in its unmanufactured, or manufactured &s;tate, en&s;ure it a deci&s;ive advantage in the home market&mdash;which amounts to con&s;iderable encouragement.

<P>This, as an important in&s;trument of manufactures, may without impro|priety be mentioned among the &s;ubjects of this report.</P>
<P>A copious &s;upply of it would be of great con&s;equence to the iron branch: As an article of hou&s;ehold fuel al&s;o it is an intere&s;ting production; the utility of which mu&s;t encrea&s;e in proportion to the decrea&s;e of wood, by the progre&s;s of &s;ettlement and cultivation.

<P>The expediency of a bounty on all this &s;pecies of coal of home production, and of premiums, on the opening of new mines, under certain qualifications, appears to be worthy of particular examination.

<P>An exemption from duty of the &s;everal kinds of wood ordinarily u&s;ed in the&s;e manufactures &s;eems to be all, that is requi&s;ite, by way of encouragement. It is recommended by the con&s;ideration of a &s;imilar policy being pur&s;ued in other countries, and by the expediency of giving equal advantages to our own workmen in wood. The abundance of timber proper for &s;hip building in the United States does not appear to be any objection to it. The encrea&s;ing &s;carcity and the growing importance of that article, in the European countries, admoni&s;h the United States to commence, and &s;y&s;tematically to pur&s;ue, mea|&s;ures for the pre&s;ervation of their &s;tock.

<P>There are &s;carcely any manufactories of greater importance, than of this ar|ticle. Their direct and very happy influence upon agriculture, by promoting the rai&s;ing of cattle of different kinds, is a very material recommendation.</P>
<P>It is plea&s;ing too, to ob&s;erve the exten&s;ive progre&s;s they have made in their principal branches; which are &s;o far matured as almo&s;t to defy foreign com|petition. Tanneries in particular are not only carried on as a regular bu&s;i|ne&s;s, in numerous in&s;tances and in various parts of the country; but they con|&s;titute in &s;ome places a valuable item of incidental family manufactures.</P>
<P>Repre&s;entations however have been made, importing the expediency of fur|ther encouragement to the leather branch in two ways; one by encrea&s;ing the duty on the manufactures of it, which are imported; the other by pro|hibiting
<PB N="47" REF="023914_0049_0FC28635B583F768">
the exportation of bark. In &s;upport of the latter it is alledged, that the price of bark, chiefly in con&s;equence of large exportations, has ri&s;en within a few years from about three dollars to four dollars and a half per cord.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;ugge&s;tions are &s;ubmitted rather as intimations, which merit con&s;ider|ations, than as matters, the propriety of which is manife&s;t. It is not clear, that an encrea&s;e of duty is nece&s;&s;ary; and in regard to the prohibition de&s;ired, there is no evidence of any con&s;iderable exportation hitherto; and it is mo&s;t probable, that whatever augmentation of price may have taken place, is to be attributed to an exten&s;ion of the home demand from the encrea&s;e of manu|factures, and to a decrea&s;e of the &s;upply in con&s;equence of the progre&s;s of &s;et|tlement, rather than to the quantities which have been exported.</P>
<P>It is mentioned, however, as an additional rea&s;on for the prohibition, that one &s;pecies of the bark u&s;ually exported is in &s;ome &s;ort peculiar to the country, and the material of a very valuable dye, of great u&s;e in &s;ome other manufac|tures, in which the United States have begun a competition.</P>
<P>There may al&s;o be this argument in favor of an encrea&s;e of duty. The ob|ject is of importance enough to claim deci&s;ive encouragement, and the pro|gre&s;s which has been made, leaves no room to apprehend any inconvenience on the &s;core of &s;upply from &s;uch an encrea&s;e.</P>
<P>It would be of benefit to this branch, if glue, which is now rated at five per cent. were made the object of an excluding duty. It is already made in large quantities at various tanneries; and, like paper, is an entire economy of materials, which, if not manufactured, would be left to peri&s;h, It may be placed with advantage in the cla&s;s of articles paying fifteen per cent.</P>

<HEAD>GRAIN.</HEAD>
<P>Manufactures of the &s;everal &s;pecies of this article have a title to peculiar favor; not only becau&s;e they are mo&s;t of them immediately connected with the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of the citizens, but becau&s;e they enlarge the demand for the mo&s;t precious products of the &s;oil.</P>
<P>Though flour may with propriety be noticed as a manufacture of grain, it were u&s;ele&s;s to do it, but for the purpo&s;e of &s;ubmitting the expediency of a ge|neral &s;y&s;tem of in&s;pection, throughout the ports of the United States; which, if e&s;tabli&s;hed upon proper principles, would be likely to improve the quality of our flour every where, and to rai&s;e its reputation in foreign markets. There are however con&s;iderations which &s;tand in the way of &s;uch an arrangement.</P>
<P>Ardent &s;pirits and malt liquors are, next to flour, the two principal manufac|tures of grain. The fir&s;t has made a very exten&s;ive, the la&s;t a con&s;iderable progre&s;s in the United States.

Nothing is more practicable and nothing more de&s;irable.</P>
<P>The exi&s;ting laws of the United States have done much towards attaining this valuable objects; but &s;ome additions to the pre&s;ent duties, on foreign di&s;tilled &s;pirits, and foreign malt liquors, and perhaps an abatement of tho&s;e on home made &s;pirits, would more effectually &s;ecure it; and there does not occur any very weighty objection to either.</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="023914_0050_0FC2863709617570">
An augmentation of the duties on imported &s;pirits would favour, as well the di&s;tillation of &s;pirits from mola&s;&s;es, as that from grain. And to &s;ecure to the nation the benefit of a manufacture, even of foreign materials, is always of great, though perhaps o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;econdary importance.</P>
<P>A &s;trong impre&s;&s;ion prevails in the minds of tho&s;e concerned in di&s;tilleries (including too the mo&s;t candid and enlightened) that greater differences in the rates of duty on foreign and dome&s;tic &s;pirits are nece&s;&s;ary, completely to &s;e|cure the &s;ucce&s;sful manufacture of the latter; and there are facts which enti|tle this impre&s;&s;ion to attention.</P>
<P>It is known, that the price of mola&s;&s;es for &s;ome years pa&s;t, has been &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ively ri&s;ing in the We&s;t-India markets, owing partly to a competition which did not formerly exi&s;t, and partly to an exten&s;ion of demand in this country; and it is evident, that the late di&s;turbances in tho&s;e I&s;lands, from which we draw our principal &s;upply, mu&s;t &s;o far interfere with the production of the article, as to occa&s;ion a material enhancement of price. The de&s;truction and deva&s;tation attendant on the in&s;urrection in Hi&s;paniola, in particular, mu&s;t not only contribute very much to that effect, but may be expected to give it &s;ome duration. The&s;e circum&s;tances, and the duty of three cents per gallon on mola&s;&s;es, may render it difficult for the di&s;tillers of that material to maintain, with adequate profit, a competition, with the rum brought from the We&s;t-Indies, the quality of which is &s;o con&s;iderably &s;uperior.</P>
<P>The con&s;umption of Geneva or gin in this country is exten&s;ive. It is not long &s;ince di&s;tilleries of it have grown up among us, to any importance. They are now becoming of con&s;equence, but being &s;till in their infancy, they require protection.</P>
<P>It is repre&s;ented, that the price of &s;ome of the materials is greater here, than in Holland, from which place large quantities are brought&mdash;the price of labor con&s;iderably greater&mdash;the capitals engaged in the bu&s;ine&s;s there much larger, than tho&s;e which are employed here&mdash;the rate of profits, at which the under|takers can afford to carry it on, much le&s;s&mdash;the prejudices, in favor of imported gin, &s;trong. The&s;e circum&s;tances are alledged to outweigh the charges, which attend the bringing of the article from Europe to the United States, and the pre&s;ent difference of duty, &s;o as to ob&s;truct the pro&s;ecution of the manufacture, with due advantage.</P>
<P>Experiment could perhaps alone decide with certainty the ju&s;tne&s;s of the &s;ugge&s;tions, which are made; but in relation to branches of manufacture &s;o important, it would &s;eem inexpedient to hazard an unfavorable i&s;&s;ue, and bet|ter to err on the &s;ide of too great, than of too &s;mall a difference, in the parti|cular in que&s;tion.</P>
<P>It is therefore &s;ubmitted, that an addition of two cents per gallon be made to the duty on imported &s;pirits of the fir&s;t cla&s;s of proof, with a proportiona|ble encrea&s;e on tho&s;e of higher proof; and that a deduction of one cent per gallon be made from the duty on &s;pirits di&s;tilled within the United States, beginning with the fir&s;t cla&s;s of proof, and a proportionable deduction from the duty on tho&s;e of higher proof.</P>
<P>It is a&s;certained, that by far the greate&s;t part of the malt liquors con&s;umed in the United States are the produce of dome&s;tic breweries. It is de&s;ireable,
<PB N="49" REF="023914_0051_0FC2863AE997D3C0">
and, in all likelihood, attainable, that the whole con&s;umption &s;hould be &s;up|plied by our&s;elves.</P>
<P>The malt liquors, made at home, though inferior to the be&s;t, are equal to a great part of tho&s;e, which have been u&s;ually imported. The progre&s;s al|ready made is an earne&s;t of what may be accompli&s;hed. The growing com|petition is an a&s;&s;urance of improvement. This will be accelerated by mea|&s;ures, tending to invite a greater capital into this channel of employment.</P>
<P>To render the encouragement of dome&s;tic breweries deci&s;ive, it may be advi&s;eable to &s;ub&s;titute to the pre&s;ent rates of duty eight cents per gallon ge|nerally; and it will de&s;erve to be con&s;idered as a guard again&s;t inva&s;ions, whether there ought not to be a prohibition of their importation, except in ca&s;ks of con&s;iderable capacity. It is to be hoped, that &s;uch a duty would bani&s;h from the market, foreign malt liquors of inferior quality; and that the be&s;t kind only would continue to be imported till it &s;hould be &s;upplanted, by the efforts of equal &s;kill or care at home.</P>
<P>Till that period, the importation &s;o qualified would be an u&s;eful &s;timulous to improvement: And in the mean time, the payment of the encrea&s;ed price, for the enjoyment of a luxury, in order to the encouragement of a mo&s;t u&s;eful branch of dome&s;tic indu&s;try, could not rea&s;onably be deemed a hard&s;hip.</P>
<P>As a further aid to manufactures of grain, though upon a &s;maller &s;cale, the articles of &s;tarch, hair powder and wafers, may with great propriety be placed among tho&s;e, which are rated at fifteen per cent. No manufactures are more &s;imple, nor more completely within the reach of a full &s;upply, from dome&s;tic &s;ources; and it is a policy, as common as it is obvious, to make them the objects either of prohibitory duties, or of expre&s;s prohibition.</P>

<HEAD>FLAX AND HEMP.</HEAD>
<P>Manufactures of the&s;e articles have &s;o much affinity to each other, and they are &s;o often blended, that they may with advantage be con&s;idered in conjunc|tion. The importance of the linen branch to agriculture&mdash;its precious effects upon hou&s;ehold indu&s;try&mdash;the ea&s;e, with which the materials can be produ|ced at home to any requi&s;ite extent&mdash;the great advances, which have been al|ready made, in the coar&s;er fabrics of them, e&s;pecially in the family way, con&s;titute claims, of peculiar force, to the patronage of government.</P>
<P>This patronage may be afforded in various ways; by promoting the growth of the materials; by encrea&s;ing the impediments to an advantageous compe|tition of rival foreign articles; by direct bounties or premiums upon the home manufacture.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t. <HI>As to promoting the growth of the materials.</HI></P>
<P>In re&s;pect to hemp, &s;omething has been already done by the high duty upon foreign hemp. If the facilities for dome&s;tic production were not unu&s;ually great, the policy of the duty, on the foreign raw material, would be highly que&s;tionable, as interfering with the growth of manufactures of it. But mak|ing the proper allowances for tho&s;e facilities, and with an eye to the future and natural progre&s;s, of the country, the mea&s;ure does not appear, upon the whole, exceptionable.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="023914_0052_0FC2863C2F060E30">
A &s;trong wi&s;h naturally &s;ugge&s;ts it&s;elf, that &s;ome method could be devi&s;ed of affording a more direct encouragement to the growth both of flax and hemp; &s;uch as would be effectual, and at the &s;ame time not attended with too great inconveniencies. To this end, bounties and premiums offer them&s;elves to <HI>con&s;ideration;</HI> but no modification of them has yet occurred, which would not either hazard too much expence, or operate unequally in reference to the circum&s;tances of different parts of the Union; and which would not be at|tended with very great difficulties in the execution.</P>
<P>Secondly.<HI>As to encrea&s;ing the impediments to an advantageous competition of rival foreign articles.</HI></P>
<P>To this purpo&s;e, an augmentation of the duties on importation is the ob|vious expedient; which, in regard to certain articles, appears to be recom|mended by &s;ufficient rea&s;ons.</P>
<P>The principal of the&s;e articles is &s;ail-cloth; one intimately connected with navigation and defence; and of which a flouri&s;hing manufactory is e&s;tabli&s;hed at Bo&s;ton, and very promi&s;ing ones at &s;everal other places.</P>
<P>It is pre&s;umed to be both &s;afe and advi&s;eable to place this in the cla&s;s of ar|ticles rated at 10 per cent. A &s;trong rea&s;on for it re&s;ults from the con&s;idera|tion that a bounty of two pence &s;terling per ell is allowed, in Great-Britain, upon the exportation of the &s;ail-cloth manufactured in that kingdom.</P>
<P>It would likewi&s;e appear to be good policy to rai&s;e the duty to 7&frac12; per cent. on the following articles. Drillings, o&s;naburghs, ticklenburghs, dowlas, can|vas, brown rolls, bagging, and upon all other linens the fir&s;t co&s;t of which at the place of exportation does not exceed 35 cents per yard. A bounty of 12&frac12; per cent. upon an average, on the exportation of &s;uch or &s;imilar linens from Great-Britain, encourages the manufacture of them in that country, and encrea&s;es the ob&s;tacles to a &s;ucce&s;sful competition, in the countries to which they are &s;ent.</P>
<P>The quantities of tow and other hou&s;ehold linens manufactured in different parts of the United States, and the expectations, which are derived from &s;ome late experiments, of being able to extend the u&s;e of labour-&s;aving machines, in the coar&s;er fabrics of linen, obviate the danger of inconvenience, from an encrea&s;e of the duty upon &s;uch articles, and authori&s;e a hope of &s;peedy and complete &s;ucce&s;s to the endeavors, which may be u&s;ed for procuring an in|ternal &s;upply.</P>
<P>Thirdly. <HI>As to direct bounties, or premiums upon the manufactured articles.</HI></P>
<P>To afford more effectual encouragement to the manufacture, and at the &s;ame time to promote the cheapne&s;s of the article for the benefit of navigation, it will be of great u&s;e to allow a bounty of two cents per yard on all &s;ail-cloth which is made in the United States, from materials of their own growth. This would al&s;o a&s;&s;i&s;t the culture of tho&s;e materials. An encouragement of this kind, if adopted, ought to be e&s;tabli&s;hed for a moderate term of years, to invite to new undertakings, and to an exten&s;ion of the old. This is an article of impor|tance enough to warrant the employment of extraordinary means in its favor.</P>

<HEAD>COTTON.</HEAD>
<P>There is &s;omething in the texture of this material, which adapts it in a pe|culiar degree to the application of machines. The &s;ignal utility of the mill for
<PB N="51" REF="023914_0053_0FC2863D1EC6F3B8">
&s;pinning of cotton, not long &s;ince invented in England, has been noticed in another place; but there are other machines &s;carcely inferior in utility, which, in the different manufactories of this article are employed either exclu&s;ively, or with more than ordinary effect. This very important circum&s;tance recom|mends the fabrics of cotton, in a more particular manner, to a country in which a defect of hands con&s;titutes the greate&s;t ob&s;tacle to &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>The variety and extent of the u&s;es to which the manufactures of this article are applicable, is another powerful argument in their favor.</P>
<P>And the faculty of the United States to produce the raw material in abun|dance, and of a quality, which though alledged to be inferior to &s;ome that is produced in other quarters, is neverthele&s;s capable of being u&s;ed with advantage, in many fabrics, and is probably &s;u&s;ceptible of being carried, by a more experienced culture, to much greater perfection, &s;ugge&s;ts an additional and a very cogent inducement to the vigorous pur&s;uit of the cotton branch, in its &s;everal &s;ubdivi&s;ions.</P>
<P>How much has been already done has been &s;tated in a preceding part of this report.</P>
<P>In addition to this, it may be announced, that a &s;ociety is forming with a capital which is expected to be extended to at lea&s;t half a million of dollars; on behalf of which mea&s;ures are already in train for pro&s;ecuting on a large &s;cale, the making and printing of cotton goods.</P>
<P>The&s;e circum&s;tances con&s;pire to indicate the expediency of removing any ob&s;tructions which may happen to exi&s;t, to the advantageous pro&s;ecution of the manufactories in que&s;tion, and of adding &s;uch encouragements as may ap|pear nece&s;&s;ary and proper.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent duty of three cents per lb. on the foreign raw material, is un|doubtedly a very &s;erious impediment to the progre&s;s of tho&s;e manufactories.</P>
<P>The injurious tendency of &s;imilar duties, either prior to the e&s;tabli&s;hment, or in the infancy of the dome&s;tic manufacture of the article, as it regards the manufacture, and their wor&s;e than inutility, in relation to the home production of the material it&s;elf, have been anticipated, particularly in di&s;cu&s;&s;ing the &s;ubject of pecuniary bounties.</P>
<P>Cotton has not the &s;ame preten&s;ions, with hemp, to form an exception to the general rule.</P>
<P>Not being, like hemp an univer&s;al production of the country, it affords le&s;s a&s;&s;urance of an adequate internal &s;upply; but the chief objection ari&s;es from the doubts, which are entertained concerning the quality of the national cot|ton. It is alledged, that the fibre of it is con&s;iderably &s;horter and weaker, than that of &s;ome other places; and it has been ob&s;erved as a general rule, that the nearer the place of growth to the equator, the better the quality of the cotton. That which comes from Cayenne, Surrinam and Demarara is &s;aid to be preferable, even at a material difference of price, to the cotton of the I&s;lands.</P>
<P>While a hope may rea&s;onably be indulged, that with due care and attention the national cotton may be made to approach nearer than it now does to that
<PB N="52" REF="023914_0054_0FC2863E8FD8F608">
of regions, &s;omewhat more favored by climate, and while facts authori&s;e an opinion, that very great u&s;e may be made of it, and that it is a re&s;ource which gives greater &s;ecurity to the cotton fabrics of this country, than can be enjoyed by any which depends wholly on external &s;upply, it will certainly be wi&s;e, in every view, to let our infant manufactures have the full benefit of the be&s;t materials on the cheape&s;t terms. It is obvious that the nece&s;&s;ity of having &s;uch materials is proportioned to the un&s;kilfulne&s;s and inexperience of the workmen employed, who, if inexpert, will not fail to commit great wa&s;te, where the materials they are to work with are of an indifferent kind.</P>
<P>To &s;ecure to the national manufacturers &s;o e&s;&s;ential an advantage, a repeal of the pre&s;ent duty on imported cotton is indi&s;pen&s;able.</P>
<P>A &s;ub&s;titute for this, far more encouraging to dome&s;tic production, will be to grant a bounty on the national cotton, when wrought at a home manufac|tory; to which a bounty on the exportation of it may be added. Either or both would do much more towards promoting the growth of the article, than the merely nominal encouragement, which it is propo&s;ed to aboli&s;h. The fir&s;t would al&s;o have a direct influence in encouraging the manufacture.</P>
<P>The bounty, which has been mentioned as exi&s;ting in Great-Britain, upon the exportation of coar&s;e linens not exceeding a certain value, applies al&s;o to certain de&s;criptions of cotton goods of &s;imilar value.</P>
<P>This furni&s;hes an additional argument for allowing to the national manu|facturers the &s;pecies of encouragement ju&s;t &s;ugge&s;ted, and indeed for adding &s;ome other aid.</P>
<P>One cent per yard, not le&s;s than of a given width, on all goods of cotton, or of cotton and linen mixed, which are manufactured in the United States, with the addition of one cent per lb. weight of the material, if made of national cotton, would amount to an aid of con&s;iderable importance, both to the pro|duction and to the manufacture of that valuable article. And it is conceived, that the expen&s;e would be well ju&s;tified by the magnitude of the object.</P>
<P>The printing and &s;taining of cotton goods is known to be a di&s;tinct bu&s;ine&s;s from the fabrication of them. It is one ea&s;ily accompli&s;hed, and which, as it adds materially to the value of the article in its white &s;tate, and prepares it for a variety of new u&s;es, is of importance to be promoted.</P>
<P>As imported cottons, equally with tho&s;e which are made at home, may be the objects of this manufacture, it will merit con&s;ideration, whether the whole, or a part of the duty, on the white goods, ought not to be allowed to be drawn back in favor of tho&s;e, who print or &s;tain them. This mea&s;ure would certainly operate as a powerful encouragement to the bu&s;ine&s;s; and though it may in a degree counteract the original fabrication of the articles, it would probably more than compen&s;ate for this di&s;advantage, in the rapid growth of a collateral branch, which is of a nature &s;ooner to attain to maturity. When a &s;ufficient progre&s;s &s;hall have been made, the drawback may be abrogated, and by that time the dome&s;tic &s;upply of the articles to be printed or &s;tained will have been extended.</P>
<P>If the duty of &s;even and an half per cent. on certain kinds of cotton goods were extended to all goods of cotton, or of which it is the principal material, it would probably more than counterbalance the effect of the drawback propo&s;|ed,
<PB N="53" REF="023914_0055_0FC286400DDC10B0">
in relation to the fabrication of the article. And no material objection occurs to &s;uch an exten&s;ion. The duty then, con&s;idering all the circum&s;tan|ces which attend goods of this de&s;cription could not be deemed inconvenient|ly high; and it may be inferred from various cau&s;es that the prices of them would &s;till continue moderate.</P>
<P>Manufactories of cotton goods, not long &s;ince e&s;tabli&s;hed at Beverly, in Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, and at Providence, in the &s;tate of Rhode-I&s;land, and conducted with a per&s;everance corre&s;ponding with the patriotic motives which began them, &s;eem to have overcome the fir&s;t ob&s;tacles to &s;ucce&s;s; producing cordu|roys, velverets, fu&s;tians, jeans and other &s;imilar articles of a quality, which will bear a compari&s;on with the like articles brought from Manche&s;ter. The one at Providence has the merit of being the fir&s;t in introducing into the United States, the celebrated cotton mill; which not only furni&s;hes mate|rials for that manufactory it&s;elf, but for the &s;upply of private families for hou&s;ehold manufacture.</P>
<P>Other manufactories of the &s;ame material, as regular bu&s;ine&s;&s;es, have al&s;o been begun at different places in the &s;tate of Connecticut, but all upon a &s;maller &s;cale, than tho&s;e above mentioned.

<P>In a country, the climate of which partakes of &s;o con&s;iderable a proportion of winter, as that of a great part of the United States, the woollen branch cannot be regarded, as inferior to any, which relates to the cloathing of the inhabitants.</P>
<P>Hou&s;ehold manufactures of this material are carried on, in different parts of the United States, to a very intere&s;ting extent; but there is only one branch, which, as a regular bu&s;ine&s;s, can be &s;aid to have acquired maturity. This is the making of hats.</P>
<P>Hats of wool, and of wool mixed with fur, are made in large quantities, in different &s;tates; and nothing &s;eems wanting, but an adequate &s;upply of materials, to render the manufacture commen&s;urate with the demand.</P>
<P>A promi&s;ing e&s;&s;ay, towards the fabrication of cloths, ca&s;&s;imires and other woollen goods, is likewi&s;e going on at <HI>Hartford,</HI> in Connecticut. Specimens of the different kinds which are made, in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Secretary, evince that the&s;e fabrics have attained a very con&s;iderable degree of perfection. Their quality certainly &s;urpa&s;&s;es any thing, that could have been looked for, in &s;o &s;hort a time, and under &s;o great di&s;advantages; and con&s;pires with the &s;cantine&s;s of the means, which have been at the command of the directors, to form the eulogium of that public &s;pirit, per&s;everance and judgment, which have been able to accompli&s;h &s;o much.</P>

<P><PB N="54" REF="023914_0056_0FC28649257C8AD8">
To encourage the rai&s;ing and improving the breed of &s;heep, at home, would certainly be the mo&s;t de&s;irable expedient, for that purpo&s;e; but it may not be alone &s;ufficient, e&s;pecially as it is yet a problem, whether our wool be capable of &s;uch a degree of improvement, as to render it fit for the finer fabrics.</P>
<P>Premiums would probably be found the be&s;t means of promoting the do|me&s;tic, and bounties the foreign &s;upply: The fir&s;t may be within the compa&s;s of the in&s;titution hereafter to be &s;ubmitted.

<P>And with regard to books which may be &s;pecially imported for the u&s;e of particular &s;eminaries of learning, and of public libraries, a total exemption from duty would be advi&s;eable, which would go far towards obviating the objection ju&s;t mentioned. They are now &s;ubject to a duty of five per cent.</P>
<P>As to the books in mo&s;t general family u&s;e, the con&s;tancy and univer&s;ality of the demand would en&s;ure exertions to furni&s;h them at home, and the means are completely adequate. It may al&s;o be expected ultimately, in this as in other ca&s;es, that the exten&s;ion of the dome&s;tic manufacture would conduce to the cheapne&s;s of the article.</P>
<P>It ought not to pa&s;s unremarked, that to encourage the printing of books is to encourage the manufacture of paper.</P>

<HEAD>REFINED SUGARS AND CHOCOLATE.</HEAD>
<P>Are among the number of exten&s;ive and pro&s;perous dome&s;tic manufactures.</P>
<P>Drawbacks of the duties upon the materials, of which they are re&s;pectively made, in ca&s;es of exportation, would have a beneficial influence upon the manufacture, and would conform to a precedent, which has been already fur|ni&s;hed, in the in&s;tance of mola&s;&s;es, on the exportation of di&s;tilled &s;pirits.</P>
<P>Cocoa, the raw material now pays a duty of one cent per lb. while choco|late which is a prevailing and very &s;imple manufacture, is compri&s;ed in the ma&s;s of articles rated at no more than five per cent.</P>
<P>There would appear to be a propriety in encouraging the manufacture, by a &s;omewhat higher duty, on its foreign rival, than is paid on the raw material. Two cents per lb. on imported chocolate would, it is pre&s;umed, be without inconvenience.</P>
<P>THE foregoing heads compri&s;e the mo&s;t important of the &s;everal kinds of manufactures, which have occurred as requiring, and, at the &s;ame time, as mo&s;t proper for public encouragement; and &s;uch mea&s;ures for af|fording it, as have appeared be&s;t calculated to an&s;wer the end, have been &s;ugge&s;ted.</P>
<P>The ob&s;ervations, which have accompanied this delineation of objects, &s;uper|&s;ede the nece&s;&s;ity of many &s;upplementary remarks. One or two however may not be altogether &s;uperfluous.</P>
<P>Bounties are in various in&s;tances propo&s;ed as one &s;pecies of encouragement.</P>
<P>It is a familiar objection to them, that they are difficult to be managed and liable to frauds.&mdash;But neither that difficulty nor this danger &s;eems &s;ufficiently great to countervail the advantages of which they are productive, when rightly applied. And it is pre&s;umed to have been &s;hewn, that they are in &s;ome ca&s;es, particularly in the infancy of new enterpri&s;es, indi&s;pen&s;able.</P>
<P>It will however be nece&s;&s;ary to guard with extraordinary circum&s;pection, the manner of di&s;pen&s;ing them. The requi&s;ite precautions have been thought of; but to enter into the detail would &s;well this report, already voluminous, to a &s;ize too inconvenient.</P>
<P>If the principle &s;hall not be deemed inadmi&s;&s;ible, the means of avoiding an abu&s;e of it will not be likely to pre&s;ent in&s;urmountable ob&s;tacles. There are u&s;eful guides from practice in other quarters.</P>
<P>It &s;hall therefore only be remarked here, in relation to this point, that any bounty, which may be applied to the <HI>manufacture</HI> of an article, cannot with &s;afety extend beyond tho&s;e manufactories, at which the making of the article is a <HI>regular trade.</HI> It would be impo&s;&s;ible to annex adequate precautions to a benefit of that nature, if extended to every private family, in which the manu|facture was incidentally carried on, and its being a merely incidental occupa|tion which engages a portion of time that would otherwi&s;e be lo&s;t, it can be advantageou&s;ly carried on, without &s;o &s;pecial an aid.</P>
<P>The po&s;&s;ibility of a diminution of the revenue may al&s;o pre&s;ent it&s;elf, as an objection to the arrangements, which have been &s;ubmitted.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="023914_0059_0FC2865E32460A78">
But there is no truth which may be more firmly relied upon, than that the intere&s;ts of the revenue are promoted, by whatever promotes an encrea&s;e of national indu&s;try and wealth.</P>
<P>In proportion to the degree of the&s;e, is the capacity of every country to contribute to the public trea&s;ury; and where the capacity to pay is encrea&s;ed, or even is not decrea&s;ed, the only con&s;equence of mea&s;ures, which dimini&s;h any particular re&s;ource, is a change of the object. If by encouraging the manu|facture of an article at home, the revenue, which has been wont to accrue from its importation, &s;hould be le&s;&s;ened, an indemnification can ea&s;ily be found, either out of the manufacture it&s;elf, or from &s;ome other object, which may be deemed more convenient.</P>
<P>The mea&s;ures however which have been &s;ubmitted, taken aggregately, will for a long time to come, rather augment than decrea&s;e the public revenue.</P>
<P>There is little room to hope, that the progre&s;s of manufactures will &s;o equally keep pace with the progre&s;s of population, as to prevent, even a gradual aug|mentation of the product of the duties on imported articles.</P>
<P>As, neverthele&s;s, an abolition in &s;ome in&s;tances, and a reduction in others of duties, which have been pledged for the public debt, is propo&s;ed, it is e&s;&s;ential, that it &s;hould be accompanied with a competent &s;ub&s;titute. In order to this, it is requi&s;ite, that all the additional duties which &s;hall be laid, be ap|propriated in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, to replace all defalcations, which may proceed from any &s;uch abolition or diminution. It is evident, at fir&s;t glance, that they will not only be adequate to this, but will yield a con&s;iderable &s;urplus. This &s;urplus will &s;erve,</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t.</HI> To con&s;titute a fund for paying the bounties which &s;hall have been decreed.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly.</HI> To con&s;titute a fund for the operations of a board, to be e&s;tab|li&s;hed, for promoting arts, agriculture, manufactures and commerce. Of this in&s;titution, different intimations have been given, in the cour&s;e of this report. An outline of a plan for it &s;hall now be &s;ubmitted.</P>
<P>Let a certain annual &s;um, be &s;et apart, and placed under the management of commi&s;&s;ioners, not le&s;s than three, to con&s;i&s;t of certain officers of the go|vernment and their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors in office.</P>
<P>Let the&s;e commi&s;&s;ioners be empowered to apply the fund confided to them, to defray the expences of the emigration of arti&s;ts, and manufacturers in par|ticular branches of extraordinary importance&mdash;to induce the pro&s;ecution and introduction of u&s;eful di&s;coveries, inventions and improvements, by propor|tionate rewards, judiciou&s;ly held out and applied&mdash;to encourage by premiums, both honorable and lucrative, the exertions of individuals, and of cla&s;&s;es, in relation to the &s;everal objects, they are charged with promoting&mdash;and to af|ford &s;uch other aids to tho&s;e objects, as may be generally de&s;ignated by law.</P>
<P>The commi&s;&s;ioners to render to the legi&s;lature an annual account of their tran&s;actions and di&s;bur&s;ements; and all &s;uch &s;ums as &s;hall not have been ap|plied to the purpo&s;es of their tru&s;t, at the end of every three years, to revert to the trea&s;ury. It may al&s;o be enjoined upon them, not to draw out the mo|ney, but for the purpo&s;e of &s;ome &s;pecific di&s;bur&s;ement.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="023914_0060_0FC2865F91B441D0">
It may moreover be of u&s;e, to authorize them to receive voluntary contri|butions; making it their duty to apply them to the particular objects for which they may have been made, if any &s;hall have been de&s;ignated by the do|nors.</P>
<P>There is rea&s;on to believe, that the progre&s;s of particular manufactures has been much retarded by the want of &s;kilful workmen. And it often happens that the capitals employed are not equal to the purpo&s;es of bringing from abroad workmen of a &s;uperior kind. Here, in ca&s;es, worthy of it, the auxiliary agency of government would in all probability be u&s;eful. There are al&s;o va|luable workmen, in every branch, who are prevented from emigrating &s;olely by the want of means. Occa&s;ional aids to &s;uch per&s;ons, properly admini&s;tered, might be a &s;ource of valuable acqui&s;itions to the country.</P>
<P>The propriety of &s;timulating by rewards, the invention and introduction of u&s;eful improvements, is admitted without difficulty. But the &s;ucce&s;s of attempts in this way mu&s;t evidently depend much on the manner of conducting them. It is probable, that the placing of the di&s;pen&s;ation of tho&s;e rewards under &s;ome proper di&s;cretionary direction, where they may be accompanied by <HI>collateral expedients,</HI> will &s;erve to give them the &s;ure&s;t efficacy. It &s;eems impracticable to apportion, by general rules, &s;pecific compen&s;ations for di&s;co|veries of unknown and di&s;proportionate utility.</P>
<P>The great u&s;e which may be made of a fund of this nature to procure and import foreign improvements is particularly obvious. Among the&s;e, the ar|ticle of machines would form a mo&s;t important item.</P>
<P>The operation and utility of premiums have been adverted to; together with the advantages which have re&s;ulted from their di&s;pen&s;ation, under the di|rection of certain public and private &s;ocieties. Of this, &s;ome experience has been had in the in&s;tance of the Penn&s;ylvania &s;ociety, for the promotion of ma|nufactures and u&s;eful arts; but the funds of that a&s;&s;ociation have been too contracted to produce more than a very &s;mall portion of the good to which the principles of it would have led. It may confidently be affirmed that there is &s;carcely any thing, which has been devi&s;ed. Better calculated to excite a general &s;pirit of improvement than the in&s;titutions of this nature. They are truly invaluable.</P>
<P>In countries where there is great private wealth much may be effected by the voluntary contributions of patriotic individuals; but in a community &s;itu|ated like that of the United States, the public pur&s;e mu&s;t &s;upply the deficien|cy of private re&s;ource. In what can it be &s;o u&s;eful as in prompting and improving the efforts of indu&s;try?</P>
