<P>THe general acceptance this Discourse found in the time of it, together with the earnest desire of many that it might be published for their further benefit, as also the intreaty of the honoured Court of Deputies who invited to the preaching of it (which I acknowledge to the praise of that gracious guidance and assistance given from the Lord to the unworthy Instru|ment) hath occasioned the exposing it to publick view. The worth of the Author will not much commend it to any, but that of the Subject may, it being of that absolute and universal necessity, and excellency, both for the spiritual, as well as outward happiness <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> this whole people, so also of each particular person; as the experi|ence of the Generation immediately foregoing abundantly testifies. You must not expect any curiosity or quaintness, the design of it being to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">difie more then to please, any further than pleasing is a means to edification, and where there is so good a frame as to be most satisfied with that by which they may be most spiritually profited. I remember what I have heard were some of the dying words of that excellent man Dr. <HI>Usher,</HI> that he thanked God he had been a plain Preacher, and used that way which the Lord is wont to accompany with the demonstration of his Spirit: it is by that way of preaching which the world counts foolishness, that God will save them that be|lieve. I doe not by this aime at my own credit, nor expect it will be promoted by it; but if I doe decrease so Christ may increase, I shall account it my glory, and the matter of my praise. If Faith and Love to God in Christ, and to his People (the spring of evangelical obedi|ence, and the way to Gods Covenant Presence with us) may hereby be furthered, I shall thereby obtain my design. In the applicatory part, I have rather laid down rules how each should carry it in their several capacities, then reproved any for miscariages in them, as
<PB REF="000260_0003_0FA410DA48013990">
judging in the best way to the end: such misdemeanors of publick Persons being more in report then proofs, that never truly represents any man. Besides, <HI>Regular est index sui et obliqui,</HI> &amp; wise, if good men will use it as a glass to discover faults for the rectifying what is amiss, as well as direction to them in the right way: and where they are not so, it is a means God blesseth for that end, <HI>Rom.</HI> 7.9. when God so commissioneth it, as he did the commandment to Paul.</P>
<P>My hearty desire is, the gracious presence of God may be with it, to promove thine and his Peoples happiness, by engaging your ende<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">vours and prayers that the Covenant Presence of God may be with you. I am</P>

<P>AFter I had received the invitation and call to this service, I can|not express the Soul tremblings I had, (indeed sense of my own unfitness at any time to speak before such an Assembly as this, and upon such an occasion; especially in a day so circumstan|ced as this is,) lest you should be disappointed of that, which you so much need, the best Counsel Heaven can afford. But being satisfied your desire was the Lords Call, I was so far en|couraged as to venture upon it, in expectation of divine Assistance: And now humbly beg this may be the wish of this whole Assembly, all the Lords people in it, that <HI>G</HI>od may be with me as he hath been with those who have formerly spo|ken in his Name, upon the like occasion; that through the help of your prayers, and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, that which is lacking may be supply|ed, and this service may turn to your Edification.</P>
<P>THe words read to you, are part of Solomons blessing of all Israel, who were assembled at the dedication of the Temple, and was after that solemn Prayer he had made, for Gods <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">avour to them in the variety of Cases, and Emer|gencies might be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">al them, ver. 55. <HI>After all this he stood and blessed all the Congre|gation.</HI> He blesseth them.</P>
<P N="1">1. By declaring them blessed, and acknowledging that favour the Lord had shewed them, <HI>ver.</HI> 56.</P>
<P N="2">2. By this holy and pathetical wish and desire, as comprehensive of all the par|ticular mercyes before prayed for, <HI>G</HI>od might so be with that Generation as with the former, with the end and effect of that desire, <HI>ver.</HI> 57,58.</P>
<P N="3">3. His further desire &amp; wish for them, that what he had particularly mentioned <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> his Prayer before, might be accepted of <HI>G</HI>od for them, <HI>ver.</HI> 59. and performed: with his designe, and end, the advancement of <HI>G</HI>ods glory, <HI>ver.</HI> 60</P>
<P N="4">4. His holy Counsel and advice to them, how they should carry it to the Lord, that they might enjoy the good desired for them, <HI>ver.</HI> 61. The Text is the second way by which he blesseth them, wishing all that good to them, that truly will make them blessed, such a presence of <HI>G</HI>od with them, as is comprehensive of all that follows. We bless others when we do wish &amp; truly desire tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> for them which will make them so; especially, when it is not a bare desire, but with Autority as this was, Solomon being a Prophet as well as a King, and here acting in an extra|ordinary way, doing that <HI>G</HI>od commanded should be done by Aaron and his Sons, Numb. 6.24, to the end To which he promised the ratifying it, as being done in the way of an Ordinance, and Institution of the Lord. In the words we have So|lomons

wish or desire for Israel.</P>
<P N="1">1. The petition itself, exprest, 1. Affirmatively, <HI>that God may be with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">,</HI> amplified and illust<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ted, 1. By the kind of his presence, as <HI>our God.</HI> 2. The Degree, <HI>as with our Fathers.</HI> 2. Negatively, by variety of words to the same sense, <HI>not leave nor forsake us.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. The Petitioner, that is Solomon, a wise man, their Ruler, acting as a Prophet, and in the name of all that People.</P>
<P N="3">3. The Persons for whom it is, all the Congregation of Israel. I shall not spend time in giving you the various readings, or Criticismes about the words; they are well rendred to comprehend the sense of them.</P>
<P N="1">1. The wish, or that is desir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">d, 1. What is meant by the presence of God or his being with us. 2. Our Fathers. 3. As with them. 4. Not to leave nor forsake, and why that is added. These must be a little cleared to make way for the Doctrine.</P>
<P N="1">1. Gods being with them. There is a twofold Presence of God, or he is said to be with any two wayes,</P>
<P N="1">1. By his essential Presence, by which God is alwayes with the creatures&punc; wherever they are, or whatever their state is, Psal. 139.7,8. So fills heaven and earth, <HI>Jer.</HI> 23.24. Comprehends all things, places, contained of none, none can hide from the knowledge, nor fly from the power of it.</P>
<P N="2">2. His providential or voluntary Presence, that is either common or special, 1. Common, and that ordinary, or more extraordinary: Ordinary, <HI>Act.</HI> 17. 18. Extraordinary, when the Lord raiseth and enables any that know him not, to doe some notable thing in the world for the service of the Church, <HI>Isa.</HI> 45.1,2,3,4. so sometimes as afflictive to his people as <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ebuchadnezzar.</HI> 2. Special, and that is either, 1. A gracious Presence, 2. Glorious, that with Saints and Angels in heaven; that is the complement of their happiness, <HI>Psal.</HI> 16. <HI>ult.</HI> Its Gods gracious presence here <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">eant with his people on earth as their Cove|nant God, that we may call his new-Covenant Presence, <HI>Let our God be with us.</HI> This gracious Presence imports two things, 1. Conferring all good, his vigilant and efficacious providence for their good. 2. Delivering and defending from all evill, both these are Covenant mercies, <HI>Gen.</HI> 15.1. by which he encourages Abraham, tells him what he might expect from his being in Covenant with him, to be his shield and exceeding great reward. And the signs of Gods Presence with Israel were the Pillar of Fire, and Cloud, the one for day, the other for night, which was to guide them in the way, and defend them from, and stand be|tween them and danger. <HI>Exod.</HI> 14.19,20. In allusion to this, the Psalmist 73. 24. comforts himself in having the Covenant presence of God with him, <HI>He shall guide me by his Counsel, and afterwards bring me to his glory.</HI> Ps.84.11. he is said to be <HI>a Sun and a shield,</HI> which first is expounded to be his free communication of all good, not witholding it, <HI>i.e.</HI> powerfully conveying it. And all know what the benefit of a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> is, that intimates his with-holding all evill. This is promised to the reforming Jews and converted Gentiles who were brought into Cove|nant with God, <HI>Isa.</HI> 4.5,6.</P>
<P N="2">2. By Fathers are meant godly Rulers and Teachers of the People of God, who are often so called in Scripture, as well as natural Parents, those in the ge|neration before them, or long before, with whom God was most eminently pre|sent, <HI>Psal.</HI> 44.1,2,3. Of those of old, but especially here is intended those in the
<PB N="3" REF="000260_0006_0FA410DE6E6F5FF8">
former Generations, for though the Lord was eminently with his people of old, in Moses and Joshuahs time, and the Judges God raised up extraordinarily to be their Saviours, yet in no Age was there a more gracious presence of God then in the Age before Solomon.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>As with our Fathers,</HI> that is, see Isa. 63.12,11. Ps.44.3,4. the presence, the Church desires, that had been with their Fathers, or such a presence. 1. In won|der-working, and as gloriously as for them as in the success David had over all the Enemies of Israel, 1 Chron. 11.9.2 Sam. 8.6,14,15. 2. That presence, or be so with us as with our holy Ancestors, by his gracious communications of him|self to us in the wayes of his Ordinances, Psal. 63.2. filling us with his glory, even in those signs of his presence as in those best times, ver. 5,6. as David found it when he fet hed the Ark to his place, 2 Sam. 6.12,13.14,15. as to their Com|munion with, so right knowledge of the things of <HI>G</HI>ods house, and that conver|ting Presence of God there, Isai. 54.13. made David say, Psal. 84.11. one day there was worth a thousand else where. As also in civil order, Ezek. 48.35. was said of them, so might be of us, this may be the Name, <HI>Jehovah Shammah,</HI> the name of our Courts and Churches, be with us as with them in these respects.</P>
<P N="3">3. In-dwelling presence, such a presence of God in our hearts as was then in theirs, filling us with his Spirit, strengthening unto duty, 2 Cor. 6.18. As God promises those that seperate from the world, 1 Cor, 15.10. Paul he acknowledg|eth he had it whence he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> so much work, &amp; in such a manner, Act 14.1. they so spake, many did believe, whence was it that those before us were so powerful, &amp; perswasive, not by excelling in common gifts above many that come after, but having a fuller presence of God, there was a more full pouring forth of the Spirit, Zec. 12.8. that which will make the feeble as David, &amp; David as an Angel of <HI>G</HI>od.</P>
<P>It may be enquired why it is said, <HI>as with our Fathers?</HI> it seems to be a limitati|on of it, when as one generation may need more then another, and usually in some respects, a succeeding generation to any special reforming generation, doth: And therefore Elisha, 2 King. 2.9. he asks a double portion of the Spirit of Eli|jah, not only to what the other Prophets had, but what Elijah himself had, as be|ing to meet with harder work, a more sinful and unreformed People.</P>
<P><HI>Answ. As,</HI> 1. Imports that kind of presence they had sometimes, the similitude and not the degree, 1 Pet. 1.15.</P>
<P N="2">2. It doth not alwayes limit the measure; a great degree of Gods gracious presence is here meant, but not just so much is intended, so much as, and as much more, as the Lord saw good; so much as might carry them as well through their duty, and work, in their generation, as those in theirs.</P>
<P N="3">3. The People of <HI>G</HI>od are wont to gather upon God, by his grants, that is van|tage ground to Faith, and Prayer, Exod. 33.13,14,15,17,18. upon every grant Moses gets in with the Lord, and asks yet greater; so it should be here, we shall be in better frame to ask more, when we have obtained so much, and in better hope to prevail.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Let him not leave us nor forsake us;</HI> These are only amplifications, and shew the weight of what he did desire, by abiding on it, not leave to others, nor to our selves, not quit the care of his People, Jer. 14.9. that he deprecates on the behalf of the Church, not take away signs of his presence, nor his own presence from them. Solomon his commendable practice is for our imitation. Hence the Doctrine from the words is,</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="000260_0007_0FA410DF2AE114D0">
Doct&punc; <HI>The obtaining and continuance of Gods eminently gracious Covenant presence with his People ought to be sincerely &amp; mainly desired by those that truly wish their happi|ness and prosperity.</HI> 1. That it should be. 2. Why it should be.</P>
<P><HI>Reas.</HI> 1. Because it is the best blessing and favour can be desired for them.</P>
<P N="1">1. It ought to be so, it is that they have done, which had the greatest love to Israel, as Moses, Exod. 33.15. Let thy presence go with us, or carry us not hence. So David desired for Solomon, and the People under him, 1 Chron. 22.11,18. So Solomon he<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> when he blesseth Israel, and it was the usual Salutation among the Jews, Ruth. 2.4.</P>
<P N="1">1. It is the most necessary blessing, nothing else is absolutely necessary but the pre|sence of God, we may be happy without Creatures, the Israelites found Clothes, houses, food was not necessary, not the ordinary way of its supply, God could sup|ply it another way; but this cannot, Luk. 10.42. there is one thing necessary, that is, the gracious presence of God, therefore Moses chuseth the Wilderness with Gods presence, rather then Canaan without him, Exod. 33.15. Heaven is not de|sireable without it, Psal. 73.25.</P>
<P N="2">2. It is the most suitable blessing to the People of God, nothing more pleasing as well as profitable to them, Psal. 4.6. therefore the best blessing.</P>
<P N="3">3. It is a sufficient good, you cannot desire a more comprehensive blessing, this is enough, Gen. 33.11. Jacob when he had obtained it by earnest prayer, he acknowledgeth he had all, nothing less will make a people happy, more is super|fluous. It is a saving, and it is a satisfying presence, Jer. 14.8. all good is in it, it is sufficient for defence against danger, Rom. 8.31. Psal. 27.2.23,4. To support assist, and succeed, in every duty, Hag. 1. 14. Math. 28.20. Gen. 39.2. so that pro|mise intimates thus much, as was made to Joshua, and applyed to the use of eve|ry Believer, Heb. 13.5. against fears of Enemies, or of want, you cannot want pro|viding for, that have <HI>G</HI>od graciously with you, Psal.144.15.</P>
<P N="4">4. The most distinguishing favour, Exod. 33.16. our experience proves it.</P>
<P><HI>Reas.</HI> 2. The want of it is the greatest evil, so <HI>G</HI>od threatneth it, Hos. 9.12. and the Prophet in the Name of the Lords people, Jer. 14.9. deprecates it, as the worst that can befal them: though Sword &amp; Famine were threatned, he takes no notice of them, but endeavours to prevent a greater; Lord do not thou leave us not forsake us, be not thou a stranger, Deut. 28. 15. at this gap all o|ther evils enter, if <HI>G</HI>od forsakes, Ordinances will leave you, any benefit by them, friends will forsake, all comforts, he carryes all with him, they are but his Atten|dants, Creatures and other enjoyments are but <HI>u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">bra Dei,</HI> especially, when all your outward good came with <HI>G</HI>ods presence, it will leave you if <HI>G</HI>od doth; it is the presence of <HI>G</HI>od, hath multiplyed you, enriched you, outwardly sanctified any of you, if he forsakes, these will not stay, no nor the People of <HI>G</HI>od neither, then Ene|mies will come, &amp; all misery, such shall say, are not all these things come upon us, because <HI>G</HI>od is not among us, &amp; Enemies will know our shadow is removed, Num. 14.14. It was that kept off Enemies from Israel, they heard the Lord was among them, that encouraged the Psalmist Enemies, Psal.71.11. <HI>God hath forsaken,</HI> hence while <HI>G</HI>od is with his People, no evil will assoil them, therefore as you would see the prosperity, and prevent the misery of the people of <HI>G</HI>od, desire the gracious presence of <HI>G</HI>od for them.</P>
<P><HI>USE.</HI> 1. For <HI>Information,</HI> See hence who are the best friends of a professing People: Who are thine O <HI>New-England</HI> that love you best, though they have not, at
<PB N="5" REF="000260_0008_0FA410DFF312A178">
least they are not so accounted of by you: Those they are who wish, pray, en|deavour that the gracious presence of God may continue with you, and be with you as signally as with any of his People in former times, or in the first times of this People. A praying, zealous, reformed and reforming Magistracy, Ministry and People, <HI>Isa.</HI> 62.7,8. that upon your walls give God no rest, that promo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e &amp; keep up the seperation between the precious and the vile, <HI>Jer.</HI> 15.19. <HI>Ezek.</HI> 22.26.30. These are your gap-men who prevent Gods going away, and ruin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> coming; but doe you not think them the troublers of Israel? Are you not wea|ry of them, and fain would be rid of them? The old and faithfull ones, that have seen the works of the Lord, doe you not with others were in their room, that you might have more elboe room? Doe you not dig pits for their soul, that pray for yours, for a converting presence of God, that you might be with him as your fathers were? <HI>Jer.</HI> 18.20. Thy best dayes are gone O <HI>New-England,</HI> if their Prayers should be turned against you. O Sirs, yet you may revive the hopes of such, if you would prize and value them, the presence of <HI>G</HI>od might be desired and obtained by them.</P>
<P N="2">2. Then those that desire <HI>G</HI>ods departure from a People are their worst ene|mies: Such as would drive away or remove his gracious presence from you. <HI>Job.</HI> 21.14,15. There are such men as would fain be rid of the presence of <HI>G</HI>od. some such bold sinners, they say it with their mouthes, would have no Sabbaths, nor preaching nor precise walking, would be rid of godly Magistrates, Ministers, Christians, they have too much of them: all wicked men say it in their hearts, o|thers in their practices, and wicked works, especially sensual Sinners, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> that have fullness of the world, have all their carnal hearts doe wish, they love not the presence of God, its not the way to sinfull pleasure or profit or credit in the world, <HI>Mal.</HI> 3.14. <HI>Isa.</HI> 30.10,11,12. will not endure plain distinguishing, sepera|ting preaching, but must be soothed, pleased in a sinfull way; so would have the holy one to cease from among them, the sanctif<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ing presence of God, that they cannot bear: and what follows? These are the worst enemies among the peo|ple that would take away your God. <HI>Judg.</HI> 18.24. he thought so of them that took away his dung-hill gods, and those means of worship of his own inventing, how much more reason have you to look upon them that would take away your glory, the signs of Gods gracious presence, even his own holy institutions.</P>
<P N="3">3. Hence see how to make a right judgement of the happiness or misery of any people, it is according to the presence of God among them, his gracious presence, <HI>Exod.</HI> 33.19. It is that makes the most noted difference between one people and another, the same people in one time and in another, according to the manifestation of his presence, <HI>Psal.</HI> 144.15. May it not in this respect be true|ly said, former dayes were better than these, when they had more of <HI>G</HI>ods pre|sence then now: but the Wise man reproves the saying so, that former dayes were better. <HI>Eccles.</HI> 7.10.</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> The meaning is not, that some dayes of the Church and people of God are not more troublesome, and others more prosperous, and that we should not bewail with godly sorrow the evil of the dayes we live in, and the sins &amp; judge|ments that make them so; you must see they are so, and enquire into the cause, but the meaning is,</P>
<P N="1">1. That which is blamed is, so to complain of the evill of present time, as not to take notice of the good in it that the Lord continues, that is folly, when the
<PB N="6" REF="000260_0009_0FA410E0AC866448">
Lord hath removed many choice and precious ones from the Bench and the Pul|pits, yet we ought to take notice with thankfulness, of the precious ones there, whom he hath le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">t, and so much of his presence with them. This was their sin, <HI>N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">mb.</HI> 14.4,5. <HI>Exod.</HI> 16.3.</P>
<P N="2">2. Nor should we complain that our Lot is cast in such a day, that is to mur|mure at the providence of God, and the holy government of it, who hath appoin|ted the places and times of every person. <HI>Act.</HI> 17.26.</P>
<P N="3">3. To insist upon a wrong cause, and charge the positive and meritorious e|vil upon the times; but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">is is wise enquiry and judgement, when we see our own and others sins to be the cause of evil times, and that evil men make evil dayes. 2 <HI>Tim</HI> 3.1,2,3. they are the deserving or meritorions cause.</P>
<P N="4">4. To judge the want of outward things, or presence of outward evils to be the cause deficient or privative of worse times, that mens trade and estates grow worse; when the true cause or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> is the gracious presence of <HI>G</HI>od which is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">ndred by our sins. <HI>Isa.</HI> 59. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> that there should be no spiritual thriving, and trade with heaven should be on the losing hand. So to see times where less of God is, to be worse, is wisdome to enquire the cause that it may be mended, and we may obtain the presence of God with us as in former times.</P>
<P><HI>USE</HI> 2. Of <HI>Exhortation,</HI> To this great Assembly, That you would sincerely desire the presence of God with this People, <HI>as with their Fathers.</HI> I am encou|raged to press this upon you, being well pers<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">aded, I speak to a great many, that love the prosperity of Jerusalem, and that come to be directed in the way to it.</P>
<P N="1">1. Endeavour it. 2. Earnestly pray for it. I will give you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">at these two ge|neral directions.</P>
<P N="1">1.

<HEAD>A Word to the Freemen.</HEAD>
<P>To all concerned in the work of this day, if you are with God in your chusing, and they are so who are chosen by you as our Fathers were, we may expect the Lord will be so with his people: our fears or hopes will be furthered as this day is managed. It is promised as an high Testimony of Gods favour to his People, <HI>Isai.</HI> 1.26. when he gives them Judges as at the first, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and how doth he give them but in that way of giving you hearts to chuse such, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> is a fruit of the right managing that other Covenant priviledge, the Lord <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">etrusted you with, <HI>Jer.</HI> 30.20. to have our Governours from among our selves.</P>
<P N="1">1. Be not negligent in your choice, this liberty is a Talent, you have this day another opportunity to use it, do not hide it in a napkin, or in the Earth, as that unfaithful Servant, <HI>Math.</HI> 25.24,25. that your worldly business may not take up that time should be employed in this Service. I have heard it much complained of, that Freemens meetings are not attended, not half of them appear upon choice of Deputies in this Town, and other concerns in that nature: and many that do come, have never prayed for guidance, no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> made enquiries of things, or persons; but only do as they are led. Is not this to do the work of the Lord negligently? To be careless of your Oath? And to be accessary to all the mischief you might have prevented, if it be any otherwise then well, and to have no part nor share in what good the Lord this way brings about to his People?</P>
<P N="2">2. Those who are active, see that it be for God, the glory of God, and the good of his People: be on Gods side, let not private respects sway you in your Elections, to be for those that are your friends or favourers, be for God, and he will be with you. If you would be so, then let your choice be guided and over|ruled by the word of God, see how men stand af<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ected to Religion, and the com|mon good of this people, 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 23.3. He must be just, ruling in the fear of God. If they had the wisdome of <HI>Solomon,</HI> Justice of <HI>Trajan,</HI> &amp;c. they would not be fit for this

People, if they are not pious. <HI>Solomon</HI> saith, <HI>wisdome with an Inheritance is good,</HI> that is most true here, or it is good, I mean that he be an heir of glory, be truly gracious, other qualifications must not be severed from, but seasoned with the fear of God. It is true, every godly man is not fit to be a Ruler, and as true, no un|godly man is. They that are not true to God, can never be so to the main Inte|rest of this his People: All other qualifications without this will make them but the more dangerous Enemies to the People of God. Be sure then you chuse friends of God, if by them you would expect a manifestation of his friendship to you. It is true, the best are subject to infirmities, that may be personal disadvantages, but they will be faithful to the interest of godliness.</P>
<P N="3">3. When you have chosen them, know that you are with God in a right and regular carriage to them, and in the way to have him with you and us.</P>
<P N="1">1. If it be a good choice of holy men, bless God for it, and take it as a pledge and token of his favour to you, and his presence with you, <HI>Isai.</HI> 1.26. <HI>Ezek.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">4.24. If otherwise, there is no Reason to complain of any, but your selves, therefore you should humble your selves before God as deserving such a Judgement, and for your sinfulness in chusing it.</P>
<P N="2">2. Follow them with your prayers, God may be with them, as he hath been with those before them, if you would pray more for them, and complain less of them you would be better People, and would find them more a blessing to you. If their missing it further your&punc; prayers, that is the best way to rectifie their pro|ceedings, 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 2.1,2. whence you were solemnly exhorted to it the last year, by a faithful Servant of Christ</P>
<P N="3">3. obey them; though this or that form of Government is mans creature, yet Magistracy is the Lords Ordinance, and their authority in those places is from God: therefore <HI>Rom.</HI> 13.1,2. Christians were bound for conscience sake to obey evill ones, when got into place, much more when good, 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 6.1. and a further obligation you have then other people, to ready obedience, they are of your own choice.</P>
<P>Remember when you chuse them, they are men: you chuse not Angels, but men of like infirmity with other good men in this world, therefore expect not too much, but you ought to think that all will not be done that ought to be. But also know when you have chosen them, they are gods by office, <HI>Psal.</HI> 82.6. and in the exercise of that to be obeyed, though only in the Lord.</P>
<P N="2">2. A word to those that are, and may be our Rulers, Honoured in the Lord, much may be done by you to obtain and maintain the presence of God with this People: One faithfull man on the Bench, may stop the gap, and prevent <HI>G</HI>ods going out at it, or enemies coming in. <HI>Ezek.</HI> 22.30. <HI>Psal.</HI> 106.23. I would hum|bly commend to you that which is your main duty, in which you ought to walk with God in that station, and do your part, God may be with you, and so with this People. It is direction given by divine Oracle, <HI>G</HI>od the Father and the Son by the Spirit spake it, 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 23.3. A Scripture hath been improved profitably a|mong you upon this occasion, by a worthy Servant of God now with the Lord, as a direction in the choice of such that may be a blessing to a People, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">d to them chosen how to carry it, that the People over whom they are may have the graci|ous presence of God among them, and continued with them, not only a promise they should have such a Ruler, but a precept what they should be, that are Rulers of Israel. More particularly,</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="9" REF="000260_0012_0FA410E2F6354608">
1. The care of the People of God and the things of God is in a great measure committed to you, as you engage your Authority for the protection and defence of these; so you are with the Lord, and he will be with you and his People by your means.</P>
<P N="1">1. For the People of <HI>G</HI>od, these are dear to God, and as the Apple of his Eye, <HI>Zech.</HI> 2.8. as he is sensible of the least wrong done to them, so of every kindness and favour shewed to them, you are as the visible covers to these Eyes, their out|ward defence under God lyes upon you; as it is a special favour to Gods people to have such as fear the Lord over them, so is it an high honour to be over such a People, and the Lord further manifests his kindness to Rulers, when they are spirited and raised up to be Saviours upon Mount Zion; it is both a manifestation of it, and a sign of more, <HI>Zech.</HI> 12.5,6,8. when God will make <HI>Jerusalem</HI> a bur|thensome stone to all that heave at them, then shall their Rulers be encouraged to stand by them, as being strong in having a people in Covenant with God to stand for, so the God of that Covenant. To these the Lord promiseth great success, as fire is to the wood laid upon it in the Hearth, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> so shall they be to their Enemies, they shall prevail against them. Let <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">out-casts dwell with you, and your Countenance and Favour be extended to all, that truly fear the Lord, though in some Circumstances they may not be of your mind, when they carry it without just offence.</P>
<P N="2">2. Care of the things of <HI>G</HI>od, his worship, that is also incumbent on you as Rulers, defence of, and encouragement in the practice of godliness, and matters of worship: I am far from thinking, Magistrates in New-Testament times, have nothing to do with, either the restraining or encouraging outward acts of men referring to the first Table: The commended Examples in Old-Testament times, that were moral actions are for our Instruction, as well as moral precepts (where those actions were not extraordinary,) As those about the worship of God and religious observation of the Sabbath, that then were under divine Institution as to that time, and mode of Service: There is the same obligation to the care of the Lords day now, and Institutions of Christ in the New-Testament.</P>
<P>But to wave the dispute of it, what is the duty, is the greatest difficulty, and made the darker, by the various apprehensions of worthy and excellent men. I shall not undertake decision of that Case, but shall endeavour to hold forth so much light for your direction in it, you may be with God, &amp; act in Integrity and Evangelical Perfection: And know you that the Lord will not withdraw because of Infirmities, and weaknesses, where there are not wilful miscarriages of his Servants.</P>
<P N="1">1. Defend them that are the most pretious things of this people, &amp; then liberty to enjoy the Ordinances of God in their purity, you must use your Authority for thei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">efence, not only from open, but secret Enemies; And what ever tends to the ruine and overthrow of the Churches here established. And as was well hin|ted by a worthy person in his Election Sermon; less will undoe us here, (this is but a little Boat) then in greater Kingdomes. I do not think errors of the mind can be compelled, but by light and Reason, or that any can be forced to be of another mind; they must be drawn, not driven, that heartily close with Christ, and em|brace Religion.</P>
<P>But if any under pretense of Religion will endeavour the subversion of that is true, and so esteemed by those in Authority, such endeavours ought to be preven|ted by them, and powerfully obviated.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="000260_0013_0FA410E480C11998">
I am perswaded, that all the people of God are agreed in the end, that injury, at least ruine should be hindred Authoritatively, the greatest doubt is about the means, what is the best way to overthrow the designs of those that are Enemies, and fundamentally so to the welfare of this People, and it is high wisdome, the choise of the fittest means to the end; it is very hard to say what that is, they can best judge of it that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ear all the Circumstances of a Case.

Those that seek the ruine of the whole, first endeavour it by dividing you, shall Herod and Pilate agree against Christ, and shall not Christians for him, and that at a time when there is so general a Conspiracy and consent a|mong the Enemies of the Truth, against all the Professors of it? Believe not re|ports of each other, take not up prejudices, if you have prejudged their persons, you will make no right Judgement of what they say, press not things wherein there may be different apprehensions, too hard, nor heighten it by giving the dif|ference too ill a Name, or too good, too odious, or glorious; if there be lesser Animosities, and personal, lay them aside, they may not hinder union for publick good, two brave Romans did so.

<P N="5">5. Acquaint your selves with the History of the glorious works of God, for this people in former times, those manifestations of Gods presence with our Fathers, &amp; further the knowledge of it among this people: you have been often minded of it, &amp; though something hath been done towards it, by Reverend &amp; worthy persons, yet those providences and experiences of seasonable and wonderful supplyes, &amp; protections, that have been most remarkable, I have not yet seen. The full sto|ry of this people to this day would be one of the best of humane Histories, for the time of it, in the world, many things yet may be had from those that have seen those wonderful works, and Fathers should tell it to their Children, <HI>Psal.</HI> 44.1,2,3. you are our publick Fathers, tell it then to your Children, the knowledge of this by Solomon was the ground of his wish for the like. It was usual with the Peo|ple of God in former times that had not the way you have to communicate remar|kable Providences to after Ages, to do it by erecting Monuments, or putting a name upon the place, <HI>Gen.</HI> 22.14. so to preserve the memory of famous Providen|ces, <HI>Exod.</HI> 17.14,15. so Moses by divine direction kept a Record of that victory over <HI>Amale<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">, Psal.</HI> 70, &amp;c. many Psalms there are to call to remembrance, thence it was <HI>Bethel</HI> had its Name, <HI>Gen.</HI> 28.19. so that Well, <HI>Gen.</HI> 16.14. <HI>Josh.</HI> 4.3,4. God himself gives himself a new Title upon it, <HI>Gen.</HI> 22.12. and it is a means of Gods presence and blessing, <HI>Psal.</HI> 78.3,4. that they may set their hope in God.</P>
<P N="2">2. As you should endeavour each in his place, we may have this presence of God, so pray for it earnestly, Importunately, stirring up your selves to take hold of God, you may not let him goe; be not willing to let go your hold on him; Ar|gue the Case with humble and holy boldness as Moses, <HI>Exod.</HI> 33.15. <HI>Numb.</HI> 14,13,14. <HI>Jer.</HI> 14.9. say as she, <HI>Ruth</HI> 1.16. as <HI>Jacob,</HI> Gen. 32.26. resolve to take no den<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">al, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">gistrates should pray he may be with this people, and the People he may be with them, with our Courts, our Ministers, in our Churches, with those that chuse, &amp;c. 1 <HI>King.</HI> 8.58.

<P N="2">2.

<P N="3">3. Consider, how unwilling the Lord is to leave and forsake a People <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> hath so owned to be his, and done so much for. How many Sta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">es hath he made a|mong us, by stilling the tumult of the Heathen, removing Sickness? Doth he not say as <HI>Hos</HI> 5.15.
