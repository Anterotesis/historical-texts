<Q><BIBL><HI>ISAIAH LIV. 16, 17.</HI></BIBL>
<P>Behold I have created the Smith that bloweth the Coals, and that bringeth forth an In&s;trument for his Work; and I have created the Wa&s;ter to de&s;troy; No Weapon that is formed again&s;t thee &s;hall pro&s;per.&mdash;</P></Q>

<P>_TRUE Sobriety of Mind aims at &s;eeing God and his Glories, in the whole Frame and Cour&s;e of Nature, as well as in the Wonders of his Grace. It leads Individuals to &s;anctify their &s;ecu|lar Bu&s;ine&s;s, by ever con&s;idering them|&s;elves as his Servants; and Numbers combined in any Profe&s;&s;ion, to recognize their Dependance on him, at the more &s;olemn Periods of their exerting, their na|tural and artificial Improvements in &s;uch Profe&s;&s;ions, by accompanying them with Acts of Devotion.</P>
<P>THE &s;acred Offices we are now engaged in, are therefore founded in Wi&s;dom, in that <HI>Fear of the Lord</HI> which <HI>is the Beginning of Wi&s;dom.</HI></P>
<P>MANY are the religious Reflections relative to the Occa&s;ion of this Day, of which Times of Tranquillity give us a Choice indifferently; but when we are &s;ur|rounded with all the Horrors of War, and dejected by a Train of pa&s;t ill Succe&s;&s;es in it; when we are appa|rently at the Eve of tho&s;e important Events, whereon our Peace, our Liberty our Being depend: We have
<PB N="6" REF="008079_0004_102FD18F88190368">
Need to arm our &s;elves with tho&s;e divine Principles, which &s;hall prevent an anxious Gloom of Mind from degenerating into repining Doubts of the Rectitude or Kindne&s;s of the Admini&s;trations of Heaven, and &s;hall chear our Spirits with the Hopes of happier Days, and fix our Tru&s;t on a &s;ure Foundation.</P>
<P>TO this End I have cho&s;en the Part of Holy Scrip|ture now read; wherein the Prophet rapt into future Time, comforts the People he wrote to, yea and Man|kind in general, &s;ubjected to various Mi&s;eries through Ignorance and Vice; repre&s;ented as an undutiful Wife, removed from the Bed and Board of her Lord, <HI>de&s;erted, afflicted, to&s;&s;ed with Tempe&s;ts,</HI> &amp;c. as in our Context, afterward re&s;tored to Favour, becoming the Mother of a numerous Offspring, having the Plea&s;ure of &s;eeing them e&s;tabli&s;hed in a noble Habitation, &s;urrounded with every Ble&s;&s;ing which can render Life comfortable or de&s;irable. Under which Allegory is de&s;igned, the unhappy State of Mankind in general for many Ages, and the glorious Effect of the Advent of the Son of God, and of the Propagation of his Religion.</P>
<P>TO confirm Faith, and in&s;pire Hope of the&s;e happy Futurities, it was needful that Men &s;hould renounce the ab&s;urd Principle, which anciently much prevailed, and &s;eems to be divers Times pointed at by the Pro|phets, viz. Of two independent Principles, or fir&s;t Cau|&s;es, of Good and Evil in the Fates of Men. Which the Prophet here does, when he a&s;&s;erts the &s;upreme Dominion of God, in tho&s;e Events, which u&s;ed to be attributed to the evil Power. <HI>Behold I have created,</HI> &amp;c.
<Q>In&s;truments of War, their Fabric, U&s;e and Succe&s;s, and the Hands they are put into, are all under my In&s;pection and Direction, you may therefore confide in my Promi&s;e of Deliverance from Evil, and of every Ble&s;&s;ing in due Time.</Q></P>

<LIST>
<ITEM>I. REFLECT upon the pre&s;ent State of Mankind re&s;pecting Wars, by it&s;elf con&s;idered.</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. AS Part of a Plan, or connected Series of the divine Proceedure, tending gradually to a Perfec|tion worthy of its Author.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>FIRST, Let us con&s;ider the pre&s;ent Condition of Mankind re&s;pecting Wars, by it&s;elf con&s;idered, as of the Con&s;titution of God, an&s;wering Purpo&s;es worthy of his Government.</P>
<P>I SAY by it&s;elf con&s;idered; becau&s;e we are not to &s;uppo&s;e that infinite Power and Wi&s;dom, can be re|duced to a Nece&s;&s;ity of u&s;ing Means, unju&s;t or cruel in their Nature, to bring about Ends of Good. <HI>The Judge of all the Earth will do Right.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="008079_0006_102FD19599E1C350">THERE have been in all Ages, tho&s;e who de&s;ired to be Athei&s;ts. Men, who when the Terrors of divine Ju&s;tice attacked them, have applyed to Infidelity, to get rid of the Fears of the Reward due to their evil Deeds. In St. Peter's Days there were <HI>Scoffers, walk|ing after their own Lu&s;ts, who tauntingly &s;aid, Where is the Promi&s;e of his Coming?</HI> Others &s;ince that Time, have from the &s;ame Motive, viewed the Works of God in an untoward Light, and in&s;olently &s;aid,
<Q>Where is the righteous and good Government of God? while Man his Creature, his Offspring, is doomed from a weak and helple&s;s Infancy, to a Series of Vexation, to all the Mi&s;eries which unhallowed Violence can inflict? Is this his World? this Aceldama, covered with Garments rolled in Blood, filled with the Cries of murdered Innocents, the Plaints of ravi&s;hed Virgins.</Q></P>
<P>OR if &s;uch Charges have been too unpopular for Reputation, or too hard of Dige&s;tion even for them|&s;elves, the &s;ame Motives have put them upon Endea|vours to confound their own and others Conceptions of God and his Attributes; for if this can be done, the &s;ame End is an&s;wered. That God, who&s;e Attributes Men have no Idea of, is neither an Object of their Hopes nor Fears. Hence adopting the abovementioned exaggerated De&s;criptions, they have &s;aid,
<Q>Di&s;order and Mi&s;ery are propagated thro' all the Creation; and yet, <HI>All that is, is Right.</HI> God governs the World. The Inference therefore is, That Wi&s;dom, Goodne&s;s, Ju&s;tice, are quite different Properties when attributed to God, from what they are in Men. We know not what to expect from him, <HI>Soul take thine Ea&s;e.</HI></Q></P>
<P>VICIOUS Men make the mo&s;t of the&s;e Difficulties&punc; &s;ober Minds have been perplexed about them, and
<PB N="9" REF="008079_0007_102FD197D6D17DE0">
ready to &s;ay with one of the Ancients, <HI>When I tho't to know this, it was too hard for me,</HI> but as he adds, <HI>till I went into the Sanctuary of God,</HI> &s;o they have found Retirement for religious Meditation and Appli|cation to the Word of God, the be&s;t Relief.</P>
<P>INDEED that future World which the human Soul perceives it&s;elf to be made for, and in which the Ora|cles of Truth a&s;&s;ure us, all pre&s;ent Inequalities &s;hall be adju&s;ted, the Sufferings of the innocent and pious infinitely more than made up, vindicates the Character of Equity and Goodne&s;s in the Supreme. But yet as we are to judge, that all his Perfections are exerted in a Con&s;i&s;tency with each other at all Times, 'tis a noble Improvement of the Mind, tending to the Honour of God, and our Ad|vantage, to examine, what Proportion appears to us in the divine Conduct here, what Ends worthy of him are an&s;wered in the Cour&s;e of Things, how fal&s;e the Sug|ge&s;tions abovementioned are.</P>
<P>A SHORT An&s;wer has been given to them by &s;ome: that the fir&s;t Man by his fir&s;t Sin, put him&s;elf out of the Protection of God, &s;o that the World was ju&s;tly de<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters">ted by him, to be a confu&s;ed State of Woe, which beginning here, &s;hall be continued for ever, except &s;o far as Grace relieves a happy few.</P>
<P>BUT Others have thought this to be rather a cut|ting the Knot than untying it. For be&s;ides the Im|propriety of Language, in &s;peaking of Beings coming into Exi&s;tence in a State of Puni&s;hment, which State implies previous Ill-de&s;ert, and to which Condition of Ill-de&s;ert none can be reduced by Cau&s;es with Re&s;pect to which they are purely pa&s;&s;ive, (&s;o that all Expre&s;|&s;ions of that Sort mu&s;t have a liberal Con&s;truction;) be&s;ides this I &s;ay they ob&s;erve that it is more agreable
<PB N="10" REF="008079_0008_102FD19A14261C90">
to the Word of God, as they think it more honour|able to him to conceive of him as the univer&s;al Father, who in this World tempers the Severity of a Judge, with the Tenderne&s;s of a Parent.</P>
<P>AND in &s;uch a Light, however vain Men may ima|gine, that this Part of the Sy&s;tem of the Univer&s;e, is not arranged in &s;uch a Manner as they &s;hould have di&s;|po&s;ed of it; yet humble Ob&s;ervers will &s;ee enough to glorify and adore him, who is <HI>glorious in Holine&s;s, fear|ful in Prai&s;es, doing Wonders.</HI></P>
<P>THAT Men are free and voluntary Agents, con&s;cious of Right and Wrong in their Temper and Conduct, the Subjects of moral Government, our own Experience and inward Sen&s;ation &s;o convince us, that all metaphy|&s;ical Arguments to the contrary, mu&s;t appear to the Tho'tful, but idle and ridiculous Sophi&s;ms. Now 'tis incident to &s;uch Beings of limited Capacities, to fall into Imprudence and Vice. What then is it to be ex|pected, will be the Cour&s;e of the Care and Govern|ment of God re&s;pecting &s;uch? Surely that while faith|ful to God, they &s;hall in general enjoy his Smiles. (I &s;ay in general, becau&s;e there may be Exceptions, among other wi&s;e Rea&s;ons, to convince us of the Certainty of the future World) Such, Revelation informs us, was the State of Innocence in the Garden of Eden, and &s;uch &s;hall be that of the <HI>heavenly Jeru&s;alem, the City of the great King.</HI> And on the other Hand, that when they offend, they &s;hall find it an <HI>evil Thing and a bit|ter;</HI> That Departure from God, is Departure from all Good.</P>
<P>IN &s;uch a State of Things, Wi&s;dom, Ju&s;tice, Good|ne&s;s, illu&s;triou&s;ly appear. If the Effect of different Conduct be proportionable, if Mi&s;ery follow Wicked|ne&s;s
<PB N="11" REF="008079_0009_102FD19BA5A1ED28">
as its Shadow, or rather as it's evil Genius&punc; and if the <HI>Work of Righteou&s;ne&s;s be Peace, and the Effect of Righteou&s;ne&s;s, Quietne&s;s and A&s;&s;urance for ever.</HI></P>
<P>THE Almighty Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of the&s;e Perfections, is yet more glorious, if the&s;e Troubles, the&s;e natural Puni&s;h|ments, which end in the Ruin of the ob&s;tinate and abandoned, prove the Medicine and Cure of tho&s;e who are meet for &s;uch a Favour, moving them to return to due Obedience; and &s;o all Events of the natural and moral Kind unite in a Tendency to Good, by Way of Motive or Example.</P>
<P>See here then the Finger of God in the Fate of So|cieties, (for I &s;hall confine my&s;elf to them, though the Ca&s;e of particular Per&s;ons be nearly the &s;ame) accord|ing to their Conduct.</P>
<P>WHEN a Community in general, for&s;akes God and Virtue, they fall into tho&s;e Errors and Sins, which ei|ther draw upon them the ju&s;t Re&s;entments of their Neighbours, or invite &s;ome hardy Invader to attack them. The Alarm is given, but what is to be expected, from a People enervated by Luxury, or drenched in &s;en&s;ual Defilements, equally lo&s;t to publick Spirit and the Fear of God? What I &s;ay is to be expected but&mdash; ba&s;e Terror&mdash;Feeblene&s;s and Di&s;union in public Coun|cils&mdash;&s;ordid Venality in tho&s;e entru&s;ted with the Exe|cution of them&mdash;In the Camp abandoned Profligacy, which takes away the Heart&mdash;in the Field da&s;tardly Cowardice? De&s;pairing of them&s;elves, not daring to look up to God; <HI>if they call, who will an&s;wer them, and to which of the Saints will they turn?</HI> They mu&s;t &s;hamefully di&s;gorge ill-gotten Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, or bow their Necks to the Yoke. The &s;ame evil Temper which affronts God, di&s;regards the Rights of Men. If what
<PB N="12" REF="008079_0010_102FD19DE404A848">
they feel amends them not, they go on to new Acts of Inju&s;tice, Breaches of Treaties or other Outrages, which provoke their Neighbours to the utmo&s;t Extremities, the mo&s;t &s;hocking De&s;olations follow, 'till their Names be no more on Earth.</P>
<P>HERE is the righteous Severity of God. For who will blame Heaven for tho&s;e Sufferings, which Men by for&s;aking the natural Means of Pro&s;perity, bring on them&s;elves? God is glorified, when all about them are delivered from the Contagion of their evil Exam|ple, and warned by their Fate to abandon Iniquity; thus <HI>Sin is the Reproach</HI> and Ruin of <HI>any People.</HI> And if wi&s;e Ends are &s;erved by &s;uch general Cala|mities, the few innocent Individuals may be &s;afely left in his Hands, mo&s;t able to cau&s;e them &s;oon to forget the Troubles, of this &s;mall Part of their Exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>THIS is one I&s;&s;ue of &s;uch Di&s;tre&s;&s;es. Let us take another View.</P>
<P>IF a People thus vi&s;ited, <HI>open</HI> their Eyes and <HI>Ears to Di&s;cipline,</HI> if they <HI>return to him that &s;miteth them;</HI> every Step of their Return to Virtue, furni&s;hes them with Principles of &s;ucce&s;sful Re&s;i&s;tance; human and divine Aids flow in, for the Re&s;toration of their Tranquillity.</P>
<P>For a religious Nation, have their Portion in this World of Imperfection and Sin, are &s;ometimes called to defend them&s;elves again&s;t the Sons of Violence, or ward off their ill De&s;igns. The <HI>Fear of the Lord</HI> will <HI>be their &s;trong Tower.</HI> The Spirit of Piety will &s;pread its Influence, on all Orders and Degrees.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="008079_0011_102FD1A020DA2030">THE governing Part of &s;uch a Society, con&s;idering them&s;elves as under the In&s;pection of the one Judge, and his <HI>Mini&s;ters for Good</HI> to the People, will not wantonly or unju&s;tly ru&s;h into Quarrels. The Go|verned having Confidence in their Rulers, and their common Sen&s;e approving their Conduct, will with a chearful and vigorous Spirit, render their nece&s;&s;ary Mea&s;ures of this Sort effectual, by contributing freely of their E&s;tates, or by per&s;onal Services. Public Mea&s;ures will be founded in Ju&s;tice, and be the Re&s;ult of Deliberation, &s;uch as they can commend to God, and their Dependance on God will limit them to &s;uch as will in the long Run be mo&s;t effectual.</P>
<P>ESPECIALLY will &s;uch a People, have a high Ad|vantage, as the &s;ame Spirit of Religion will po&s;&s;e&s;s their Soldiery.</P>
<P>THE religious Soldier, is in&s;pired to Diligence in accompli&s;hing him&s;elf in the Art of War, not by the Hope of a Plume of Feathers, not by the tin&s;el Ambition of wearing a Commi&s;&s;ion; much le&s;s by the &s;ordid Pro&s;pect of &s;ix Pence a Day, or the brutal Love of Plunder and Blood: But that he may be an In&s;trument in the Hand of God, of <HI>breaking the Teeth of the Oppre&s;&s;or, and plucking the Spoil out of his Mouth,</HI> of maintaining Right, re&s;toring Peace and &s;preading Happine&s;s all around him.</P>
<P>THIS Spirit of Religion will render a Camp, a well ordered Family, a Hou&s;e of God formed for his Prai&s;e. Officers will imitate the &s;upreme Ruler in Ju&s;tice tempered with Meekne&s;s and Benignity, at|tracting the Love and Confidence of all under Com|mand, &s;o that they will <HI>dare</HI> and choo&s;e to die with them, and for them. Councils of War, will be ma|naged,
<PB N="14" REF="008079_0012_102FD1A358B977C0">
with Dependance on the Source of Wi&s;dom and Courage, at who&s;e Tribunal every Vote is to be ac|counted for. Neither their Troops nor Country, will be &s;acrificed to the gay Humours of a Bottle; much le&s;s will they wa&s;t away the Property, and &s;ell the Lives and Liberties of their Brethren, for the paltry Con&s;ideration of keeping them&s;elves in Pay; the Con|&s;equence of which will be, &s;low Motions&mdash;inactive Campaigns&mdash;Surprizes and Di&s;grace. The Ancients placed Men of &s;uch a Ca&s;t, deep in Hell. <HI>Vendidit hic Auro Patriam.</HI></P>
<P>PRIVATE Men, under the Influence of a Spirit of Piety, will be &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive to Superiors, not only for Wrath, but Con&s;cience Sake; they will apply them|&s;elves to every Part of Duty, as called thereto by God; they will amid&s;t the Duty of their Place, &s;till remember that there is One <HI>higher than the Highe&s;t</HI> on Earth, to whom they are at the &s;ame Time to be faithful; and therefore by devout Meditation, and living as under the In&s;pection of Heaven, they will be &s;pirited to Care and Diligence, and when &s;ummon|ed to Arms will have no dead Weight to depre&s;s them. Religious Temperance &s;trings the Nerves; gives Strength and Firmne&s;s to the Body, and maintains an equal uniform Pre&s;ence of Mind, in every Emergency.</P>
<P>BUT never is this divine Principle of all that is good, more nece&s;&s;ary or more advantageous, than in the Field of Battle, when Death pre&s;ents it&s;elf in all its Terrors; then to be able to &s;ay, my Cau&s;e is good, approved of Heaven; in hazarding my Life for the pre&s;ent Happine&s;s of my Friends and Country, I follow him, who gave up his precious Life for the future Happine&s;s of all Mankind: Nor am I going to contend with giddy Chance or &s;ullen Fate; the

Ruler of the World is the Arbiter, he pre&s;ides over the Field of Battle; <HI>The Eyes of the Lord run to and fro throughout the Earth, to &s;hew him&s;elf &s;trong in Behalf of them who&s;e Heart is perfect toward him;</HI> the Fate of Armies is decided by infinite Wi&s;dom; if I die, 'tis to lie down in the Bed of Honour, and <HI>my Fle&s;h &s;hall re&s;t in Hope;</HI> And what is Death, but a Step into the calm Regions of everla&s;ting Peace? God is my Friend, Je&s;us my Saviour was <HI>made perfect through Sufferings,</HI> and I pre&s;s on with Confidence, that if I breath my la&s;t in the Field, <HI>this Day</HI> my Soul <HI>&s;hall be with</HI> him <HI>in Paradi&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>WITH what a different Spirit will &s;uch an One fight, from tho&s;e abandoned Souls, who &s;hall be alarmed, in the Revels of a drunken Debauch; &s;um|moned from the unmanly Pollutions of a Harlot's Lap; or while bla&s;phemous Oaths are on their Tongues; to face an Enemy, yea the la&s;t Enemy; with what Stupidity, or Dread of falling into the Hands of the living God?</P>
<P>NOR am I de&s;cribing an imaginary Influence, but what the Experience of all Ages may te&s;tify. For if Enthu&s;ia&s;m, a &s;uppo&s;ed Cau&s;e of God, or feigned Sto|ries of Intercour&s;e with him, have rendered Armies, ir|re&s;i&s;tible; if vague and unmeaning Prodigies, fancied Symptoms of divine Di&s;plea&s;ure, have palled the Cou|rage: How much more &s;hall &s;ub&s;tantial Guilt, di&s;arm the Soul, and Hope toward God, rai&s;e the Spirits, and pave the Way to Victory?</P>
<P>THUS the Spirit of Religion and Virtue, in its Effects, naturally tends to Succe&s;s; to make a People re&s;pect|ed and feared; and &s;o to &s;ettle their Security on a &s;ta|ble Foundation, except Imprudence, Ra&s;hne&s;s or Want
<PB N="16" REF="008079_0014_102FD1A770AC4FD8">
of Care, (which natural Infirmities of Men, even Reli|gion does not entirely cure,) prevent.</P>
<P>THERE is one Ca&s;e more remains to be con&s;idered; and that is, where contending Parties are in moral Regards on a Par, alike earthly, &s;en&s;ual, de&s;titute of the Principles of Religion.</P>
<P>AND who &s;hall find Fault, if a righteous God has &s;o ordered Things, as that by ungodly Pa&s;&s;ions, they plague and harra&s;s each other; and <HI>bite and devour</HI> 'till they wa&s;te their Trea&s;ures and Strength, mutually &s;preading Poverty and De&s;olation, 'till they <HI>be con&s;umed of one another,</HI> and become public Examples, of the de&s;tructive Tendency of ungoverned Pa&s;&s;ions, or being worn out, at la&s;t give Peace, to the quiet in the Earth, or are by Di&s;tre&s;&s;es led to a better Mind. Or if one Party &s;hould much prevail, yet the Spirit of Impiety will carry them on, either to tho&s;e Acts of Inhuma|nity, which might &s;tir up a conquered Enemy, to that Rage of De&s;pair, which &s;ometimes carries all before it; or Power, Plenty and Peace will lead them to that Licentiou&s;ne&s;s and vicious Indulgence, which prepares them for a Rever&s;e of Condition, and carries them on &s;wift to De&s;truction.</P>
<P>Such as I have pointed out, is in general the Con|dition of human Affairs, as the wi&s;e God has been plea&s;ed to e&s;tabli&s;h the Series of Cau&s;es and Effects. And if to this be added, that &s;pecial Interpo&s;ition of his Providence in great Exigencies, which Rea&s;on and Revelation teach us to expect, and which many me|morable Events of pa&s;t Times are hardly otherwi&s;e to be accounted for; in bringing formidable deep-laid De|&s;igns to nought, in Ways unlooked for; in the pro&s;|perous Succe&s;&s;es of Handfulls of Men, when contend|ing

<P N="2">II. WE are to reflect on the pre&s;ent State of Man|kind re&s;pecting War, as Part of a Plan, or connected Series of the Admini&s;trations of God, tending gradu|ally to a Perfection, worthy of its Author.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="008079_0016_102FD1AC9C78AE58">A THOUGHTFUL Mind will have a proper Sen&s;e of his own Imperfection, e&s;pecially how &s;oon and utterly he is lo&s;t, when he contemplates Infinity, and the Works of the incomprehen&s;ible God. And yet as the P&s;almi&s;t &s;ays, <HI>Who&s;o is wi&s;e</HI> and ob&s;ervant, will &s;ee the Perfec|tions of God, tho' he cannot comprehend them. When the Que&s;tion is &s;tarted, Why if God be infinitely Good, are there Degrees of Perfection in his Works? Why did not omnipotent Benevolence make all his Works, in the mo&s;t perfect State of Happine&s;s, and at all Times invariably fixed in it? Beyond the An&s;wer, which Mode&s;ty and Humility are content with, viz. That the Wi&s;dom of God is un&s;earchable; be&s;ides this it may not be irreverent to ob&s;erve, That we may be mi&s;taken in &s;uppo&s;ing that the greate&s;t Quantity of Happine&s;s, would be enjoyed in the Univer&s;e collec|tively, if the Creatures of God were &s;o created and confirmed.</P>
<P>FOR as to the divers Ranks of created Beings, our Speculations may be in &s;ome Mea&s;ure ju&s;t, when we conceive, that as in Philo&s;ophy, one infinite Solid is in|finitely greater than another; &s;o the whole Sum of Happine&s;s, communicated to Angels, Men and all the Creatures of God, is infinitely greater, than could po&s;|&s;ibly have been po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, by an infinite Number of the highe&s;t Seraphim which &s;urround the Throne of God, had all Degrees of Perfection below them been left a Blank. This Tho't ab&s;tru&s;e indeed and inconclu&s;ive, I mention, only for the Sake of inferring, that when Men give them&s;elves Licence, to accu&s;e the Creator of penuriou&s;ly di&s;pen&s;ing Happine&s;s, they go upon uncertain Grounds, and are very incompetent Judges, in the Matter.</P>
<P>IN like Manner, if curious Minds, when they hear of a Gradation of the &s;ame Species of Works of God,

at different Times toward Perfection, of the &s;ame or different Individuals, wonder why immen&s;e Love did not put them (Men for In&s;tance) at once into that State of Happine&s;s which they hope to arrive to: Tis &s;ufficient to &s;ay, that we cannot tell that the whole Sum of the Happine&s;s of our Race had been encrea&s;ed thereby&punc; Nor can we affirm, but that every finite rea&s;onable Nature, is made happy, by Activity, and that Activity pre&s;erved by having Objects in View to pur&s;ue, by Hope, by the Approach of joyful Scenes, by &s;urmounting Difficulties, by e&s;caping Dangers, by po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing Happine&s;s as the Prize of Labour, by compar|ing their different Situations at different Times, and the Con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s that they have &s;omething further to attain.</P>
<P>THESE Things being premi&s;ed, let it be ob&s;erved, That from what was &s;aid under the former Head, it may appear, that there is a Tendency in Religion (tho' there may be accidental Ob&s;tructions) to Succe&s;s in Wars, by Means of that public Spirit, Union in Councils, due Subordination and its Duties, Tempe|rance, Prudence, Courage, which it lays the Foundation of. Now if &s;uch a righteous Nation in their nece&s;&s;ary Self-defence, &s;hould conquer and extend them&s;elves, ob&s;tinate Enemies would be exterminated, their con|&s;picuous Victories would attract the Eyes of all around them, convince them that God was with them; lead them thro' Fear or Love to be at Peace with them. Their Moderation in Succe&s;&s;es, their Ju&s;tice and Hu|manity, would conciliate Friends, &s;trengthen Alliances, and propagate the Spirit of Religion.

We have Inju&s;tice, Fraud and Violence to conflict with. The divine Ble&s;&s;ing on the va&s;t Arma|ments now entring on Action, may indeed open to us more plea&s;ing Pro&s;pects. But it &s;eems as tho' America was de&s;tined to be the Seat of frequent Wars. This at la&s;t is a Day of Darkne&s;s. What is Wi&s;dom? What is Duty? 'Tis to employ every Mea&s;ure wherein we may depend on God for the Settlement of our Safety.</P>
<P>A MILITARY Spirit ought to be cultivated. Our Rulers are &s;en&s;ible of it. They have amended our Laws in this Re&s;pect.

<P><HI>Your Excellency</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">His Excellency THOMAS POWNALL, E&s;q.</NOTE> will permit me, according to the Cu&s;tom of this Day, to &s;ay on this fir&s;t Occa&s;ion, of properly addre&s;&s;ing you from the De&s;k, in your Capa|city of Captain General of this Province, that tho' God be Lord of all, yet &s;uch is his Appointment, that the Fate of Societies, much depends on the Conduct of &s;ubordinate Rulers. You have been entru&s;ted with the Government of this Province, at a Time when your Attention, is to be peculiarly fixed on military Affairs, and all your Wi&s;dom and Fidelity needed. We re|ceive as an Omen of Good, what has been heard with|out Doors, of your <HI>Excellency</HI>'s Zeal for the Perfection and due Execution of our military Laws; your Ad|herence to the Maxim of giving none Commi&s;&s;ions in the Service of this Year's Campaign, but tho&s;e who could be recommended by Men of Worth; the Quiet and Silence with which &s;o very large a Body of Troops
<PB N="30" REF="008079_0028_102FD1C9865988B8">
has been rai&s;ed in the Government, under your Influ|ence, this Sea&s;on. Your public Speeches &s;hew your ju&s;t and exten&s;ive Views of the evil De&s;igns of our in|veterate Enemies, and your Re&s;olution to do your Part, and direct us to ours, for our Protection and Defence.</P>
<P>MAY you &s;ee a happy Effect of the&s;e Fir&s;t-fruits of your Care for the Public, here. Whatever be the Event now, yet you are, Sir, in the prime of Life, and &s;hould God continue you in this Po&s;t, till old Age, till you &s;hall &s;ee another Generation ri&s;en, formed by your civil as well as military Influence, to that manly Tem|perance, which you your&s;elf feel the Benefit of; to that Virtue and Piety, which even bad Rulers find the Nece&s;&s;ity of cultivating as an Engine of Policy, and which we are convinced you will promote, from an inward Sen&s;e of its Operation on the pre&s;ent and future Good of the People you govern; you will then re&s;ign your Tru&s;t, with that Plea&s;ure, which a benevolent Heart feels, on having done great and la&s;ting Good, &s;ure that in the&s;e Attempts for promoting permanent Happine&s;s, in your Sphere, you will meet with the Approbation of that gracious Being, who <HI>is good to all, and who&s;e tender Mercies are over all his Works.</HI></P>
<P>It remains, that you <HI>Gentlemen of the Artillery,</HI> be exhorted to profit by the Doctrine of our Text. In aiming at &s;uperior military Accompli&s;hments, you act a Part &s;uitable to the pre&s;ent State of the World, and wherein you may be Workers together with God, who&s;e Judgments are a great Deep, for the bringing on, a better. It has been &s;ugge&s;ted, that our Enemies have of late been &s;upplyed with gallant Officers, by Means of their Academies of War, and &s;uch other Encourage|ments, as have excited them by every Motive of Ho|our and Profit, to be expert in their Profe&s;&s;ion. So far

as your Example and Influence extend, we follow them. It were to be wi&s;hed, a Spirit of Emulation more prevailed, and that in every Town, &s;mall Com|panies of Men of &s;uch a Genius were formed, and your Pattern followed. For if <HI>New-England</HI> would be &s;afe, her Children mu&s;t be a Band of hardy Soldiors, for Generations to come, till the Nations of the World &s;hall learn War no more. The Scene too, is changed &s;ince the la&s;t Age, and indeed &s;ince the la&s;t War. Tis no longer the only Thing needful to ferret out a &s;kulking Enemy from their Rece&s;&s;es; We have to con|tend with di&s;ciplined Troops, and cannot be always &s;ure of A&s;&s;i&s;tance from Abroad.</P>
<P>Go on then and pro&s;per, <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> only add to every other Qualification, that mo&s;t important one of &s;olid Religion, the Influence of which I have attempted to de&s;cribe. Let me add, that as you are Gentlemen of &s;uperiour Figure, &s;hould you be called to active Ser|vice, you will probably be honoured with Commi&s;&s;ions; and here your Sobriety and Virtue, will have an Influ|ence you can &s;carcely now conceive of, on tho&s;e under your Command. The Manners of Superiors have been found &s;o to de&s;cend. Real Religion will not only qualify you for per&s;onal Service, but give you Weight, attract Re&s;pect and Obedience, and if it infu&s;e not the &s;ame Spirit into all who behold it, yet awes them to that outward Decorum, which is a high Advantage in an Army. Above all it will carry <HI>You</HI> above the Fear of Death, and Armies have &s;eldom been beat, under intrepid Officers.</P>
<P>TO CONCLUDE, Let us all be in&s;pired to pre&s;ent Duty, by a firm Per&s;ua&s;ion that right Conduct, true Goodne&s;s e&s;pecially, always tends to the general Good, and that the more the Spirit of Religion prevails, the
<PB N="32" REF="008079_0030_102FD1CD4D67A7E8">
nearer we are to tho&s;e happy Days, when God &s;hall dwell with Men. Every private Man, who <HI>fears God and works Righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> le&s;&s;ens the Proportion of Sin, encrea&s;es and diffu&s;es that Temper which is productive of all Good. Men in di&s;tingui&s;hed Stations, whether civil or military, do &s;o yet more, by the Con&s;picuity and happy Influence of their Virtues. Princes are indeed the <HI>Sons of the mo&s;t High,</HI> when they follow God, in exerting their Power, for the re&s;i&s;ting the proud, and promoting the Peace and Pro&s;perity of their Subjects. <HI>Angels which are greater in Power and Might, rejoice to do God's Will</HI> even when they de&s;troy Thou&s;ands in a Night, for the Peace and Safety of tho&s;e whom God delights to ble&s;s. Je&s;us the Mediator who is higher than the Kings of the Earth, &s;its enthroned on the right Hand of God, there exerting his exalted Power, in &s;ubduing his and our Enemies, by <HI>the Sword of the Spirit the Word of Truth,</HI> accompanied with his al|mighty Energy; promoting that inward Di&s;po&s;ition to Love and Peace, which e&s;tabli&s;hes the&s;e Ble&s;&s;ings on a better Foundation than Terror or Policy. This De|&s;ign he will carry on, till he has made all his <HI>Enemies his Foot&s;tool. The la&s;t Enemy that is to be de&s;troyed is Death.</HI> This he &s;uffers to remain, and this is like|wi&s;e in due Time to be <HI>&s;wallowed up in Victory,</HI> at that &s;olemn Period, when the Purpo&s;es of God having been an&s;wered, by all the Vici&s;&s;itudes of earthly Things, a yet more &s;table State of Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s &s;hall be the Portion of tho&s;e who have overcome in the Chri&s;tian Conflict; then <HI>Je&s;us</HI> the Mediator &s;hall al&s;o <HI>deliver up the Kingdom</HI> to him that appointed him; that <HI>God may be all, and in all.</HI></P>
