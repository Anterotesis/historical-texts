<P>An Addre&s;s to the El|ders of the Church, upon the oc|ca&s;ion of &s;ome Friends compelling certain Per&s;ons, and their po&s;terity, to &s;erve them continually and arbitraryly, without Regard to E|quity or Right, not heeding whe|ther they give them any thing near &s;o much as their Labour de|&s;erveth.</P>

<HI>_MY Dear Beloved Friends, and Elder Brethren, whom as it behoves me, I would intreat as Fathers, a waighty Concern from the Lord, is and hath been at times for many Years on my Spirit, in con&s;ideration of this unchri&s;tian Liberty, being indulged in the Church, for it is in it&s;elf none of the lea&s;t of the World's Co|ruptions,</HI> [no, &s;ay I, but the greate&s;t, that ever the Devil brought into the Church in <HI>America;] and indeed the Lord by his Spirit, manife&s;ted the Evil to me before I was</HI> 12 <HI>Years of Age, and &s;ince from time to time, I have had drawings in mind to re|prove and te&s;tify again&s;t it, nor have I been altogether &s;ilent, altho' much di&s;courag'd by rea&s;on of it's being practiced by &s;o many Friends, yea Elders too, and tho' I have formerly thought it &s;trange, that the Church did not exclude it, by her di&s;|cipline, and fix the Judgment of Truth upon it, yet now I am &s;en&s;ible &s;uch a thing is not ea&s;ily done or accompli&s;hed, there be|ing &s;o &s;trong oppo&s;ition in many, that it cannot be brought to the Te&s;t, and Judg|ment brought forth into Victory in the cau&s;e at pre&s;ent, without danger of much <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">rife and di&s;order in the Church, which is
<PB N="8" REF="004149_0007_1003B98AA09C28E8">
generally hurtful where-ever it prevaileth; therefore to be carefully avoided; however I hope we are all unanimous in our judge|ment, that whatever Friend hath any thing from the movings of the Spirit of Truth to communicate to his Brethren, either by word or writing concerning this or any other matter, ought to be allowed and received in his Te&s;timony, and borne with by his Brethren, &s;o long as he keeps to the coun&s;el and direction of the Holy Spirit, and therefore delivers nothing but what is according to Truth, altho' it hap|pens to be never &s;o contrary to the intere&s;t or inclinations of the Readers or Hearers.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Now I would &s;uch Friends as Practice or Plead for the above&s;aid Sin, Evil or Liberty, to con&s;ider &s;ollidly what Hard&s;hip they impo&s;e on &s;uch as are concern'd to bear Te&s;timony again&s;t it; for while &s;o many Friends continues in &s;aid Practice, no one can reprove it, and give it that de&s;erved Character, which is agreeable to it's na|ture, without implicitly condemning many of his Brethren,</HI> [Mini&s;ters and all &s;ay I, for they are the wor&s;t Enemies in this ca&s;e the Church has to War with, or that Hell it&s;elf, or Devil can procure in this ca&s;e. (This is very pinching, <HI>B. L.</HI> can&s;t thou prove thy Allegations?) if
<PB N="9" REF="004149_0008_1003DD7C6D814AC0">
not, what will become of thee? Never fear, Friend; Fear &s;upri&s;es, thou knows who; but the Truth is &s;tronger than all the Powers of Hell. Ble&s;&s;ed for ever is the God of Truth, the Truth of God, the Truth which is God: So be it, &s;aith my Soul.</P>
<P><HI>Brethren and Elder Brethren, as Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors in this Thing, which is very hard to do, yet if the Lord require &s;uch a Thing or Te&s;timony of any Friend he is ne|ce&s;&s;itated &s;o to judge his Brethren, or quench the Spirit in its Motions, in his own Heart; for the ca&s;e admits of no medium. Again I intreat tho&s;e who &s;lights and di&s;|regards the Te&s;timony of any whom the Lord concerns to appear again&s;t this fle&s;hly Liberty, to con&s;ider whom thy oppo&s;e, and with&s;tand; and the in&s;pired Apo&s;tle &s;peak|ing concerning the Lord's In&s;truments, whom he was plea&s;ed to make u&s;e of, &s;aith</HI> 1 The&s;s. iv. 8. <HI>He therefore that de&s;|pi&s;eth, de&s;pi&s;eth not Men, but God, who hath al&s;o given unto us his Holy Spirit. O! That I could prevail &s;o far with all my dear Brethren, that none would any more plead for or endeavour to defend the afore&s;aid unju&s;t Practice; neither endeav|our to &s;hield it from the judgment of Truth. We may do well to remember, the Devil is

the Author of all Sin, and Sin is the Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of the Law.</HI></P>
<P>No greater nor no better Law, &s;ay I, than to love God above all, and all our Fellow-Creatures as our&s;elves; the&s;e two contain Law, Prophets and Go&s;pel, do to all as we would be done by. No greater Sin Hell can invent, than to prophane and bla&s;pheme the pure and Holy Truth, which is God all in all, and remove God's Creatures made after his own Image, from all the Comforts of Life, and their Country and procure for them, and bring them into all the mi|&s;eries that Dragons, Serpents, Devils, and Hypocrites, can procure and think of; the&s;e things are carried on by Chri&s;|tians, &s;o called, and Mini&s;ters too, in the very greate&s;t appearance of Demuri|ty and Sanctity in the whole World, that ever I read or heard of; God which is the Truth, &s;aith we &s;hall not eat this cur&s;ed Fruit; our Mini&s;ters &s;ay we may eat, and lawfully too; which &s;hall we believe?</P>
<P>We pretend not to love fighting with carnal Weapons, nor to carry Swords by our &s;ides, but carry a wor&s;e thing in the Heart, as will I believe appear by and by; what, I pray and be&s;eech you, dear

Friends, by the tender Mercies of our God, to con&s;ider, can be greater Hypo|cri&s;y, and plainer contradiction, than for us as a People, to ref<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">e to bear Arms, or to pay them that do, and yet purcha&s;e the Plunder, the Captives, for Slaves at a very great Price, there|by ju&s;tifying their &s;elling of them, and the War, by which they were or are obtained; nor doth this &s;atisfy, but their Children al&s;o are kept in Slavery, <HI>ad infinitum;</HI> is not this plainly and &s;ub|&s;tantially trampling the mo&s;t Ble&s;&s;ed and Glorious Te&s;timony that ever was or ever will be in the World, under our Feet, and committing of Iniquity with, both Hands earne&s;tly?

<P>My dear Friends, I beg, I would in|treat, in all Humility, with all earne&s;t|ne&s;s of mind, on the bended Knees of my Body and Soul; willingly and with all readine&s;s, &s;incerely, if that would

<P>What a great Strait the&s;e tender hearted mourning Souls mu&s;t needs be in, think ye, betwixt Love and Duty; they love you dearly for the Truth &s;ake, and yet think it their Duty ab&s;o|lutely in the Fear and Love of God, to te&s;tifie again&s;t the Sin, and you for con|tinuing in it.</P>

<P><HI>W. B.</HI> In his Preface, mentions &s;ome|thing of the Lord's dealing with him, when he was about about 10 or 12 Years of Age, which I &s;uppo&s;e is about 50 Years ago, then there was much Di&s;|cour&s;e about many <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Dutch</HI> People, being taken into <HI>Turky,</HI> or by the <HI>Turks</HI> into Slavery, and &s;old in the Mar|ket, for Term of Life, as Bea&s;ts in the Field. As our brave Chri&s;tians &s;o call'd do, and have done for many Years in <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> and el&s;ewhere in <HI>America,</HI> by the poor Negroes, which is ten times wor&s;e in us; all things con&s;ider'd; but what crying, wringing of Hands, what Mourning and Lamentations there was then by their Relations, Wives for their Husbands, Parents for their Children, Relations for their Friends, one Neigh|bour for another! what exclaiming again&s;t the <HI>Turk</HI> for his Tyranny and oppre&s;&s;ion, and cruel Dealing and Treatment, to|wards their Friends, and may be cur&s;ing and calling for Damnation to him and his God too.</P>
<P>Well my Friends, con&s;ider of it, and make an Application &s;uitable to the circum&s;tance of your own Slaves; for I do not believe in my Soul, the <HI>Turks</HI> are
<PB N="16" REF="004149_0015_1003DDA20F8F3B08">
&s;o cruel to their Slaves, as many Chri&s;|tians, &s;o called, are to theirs, by what I have &s;een and heard of, in <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> and el&s;ewhere; and I give you a rea&s;on for it. I was near 18 Months, on board a large Ve&s;&s;el of 400 Tons in a Voyage to <HI>Scanderoon</HI> in <HI>Turky,</HI> with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">our Men that had been 17 Years Slaves in <HI>Turky,</HI> and I never did under&s;tand by them, that they were &s;o badly u&s;ed as the poor Negroes are by &s;ome called Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>Ezra vi. 21, 22.</P>
<P><HI>And the Children of</HI> I&s;rael, <HI>which were come again out of Captivity, and all &s;uch as had &s;eparated them&s;elves unto them from the filthine&s;s of the Heathen of the Land, to &s;eek the Lord God of</HI> I&s;rael, <HI>did eat.</HI></P>
<P><HI>And they kept the fea&s;t &s;even Days with joy: For the Lord made them joyful,</HI> that had &s;eparated from the filthine&s;s of the Heathen.</P>
<P>It is like there was &s;ome, which came out of <HI>Babylon,</HI> and out of Captivity in &s;ome &s;ort, which neverthele&s;s would not &s;eparate them&s;elves from the filthine&s;s of the Heathen. For long cu&s;tom had made it &s;o familiar, ea&s;y and &s;weet un|to them, that they would not leave it,

no not for the Joy of the Lord. And &s;ome of the&s;e were Prie&s;ts and Levites, for ought we know; for they loved their Heathen Whores, I believe, and other filthine&s;s, which the Heathens allow of, almo&s;t as well as our Spiritual Prie&s;ts and Levites, under the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, do their Slaves, it is a very plain, parallel ca&s;e, when neither the one or the other will part with them, no not for the Joy of the Lord. Then to be &s;ure not for the comfort and Joy of their Brethren, and Si&s;ters, who have been in &s;ore Bondage, and Thraldom or Captivity, on that &s;in|ful Helli&s;h Account, Slave-keeping, for 50 Years and more; and that by their Brethren and Si&s;ters, which keeps them and will keep them, in &s;pite of them, let them beg or pray, or &s;ay, or do what they can or will.</P>
<P>And all this while Preach, as their tender Friends do; who cannot touch with that &s;inful practice to gain the whole World; profe&s;s the &s;ame Pure Truth, Go&s;pel, Unction, Annoynting, Urim, and Thumim, Mea&s;ure of the Spi|rit, pretend they have received the &s;ame Manife&s;tation and Di&s;pen&s;ation to preach, as their innocent Friends, Brethren, or Si&s;ters have.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="004149_0017_1003DDB1399BD550">
And really to give them their due, they come very near them in Words, for what I and &s;ome others can &s;ee; for we have ob&s;erved them &s;trictly as is our duty upon the Truths Account, which &s;uffers &s;o much by them, and their &s;in|ful practice, as well as their oppre&s;&s;ed, and greatly afflicted Brethren and Si&s;ters.</P>
<P>I &s;ay the&s;e Nocents, come very near the Innocents in Words, except here and there, they do &s;tretch and &s;train, re&s;t, part, pervert, mi&s;con&s;true, and mi&s;|apply Scripture to &s;erve their covetous Ends, or to ju&s;tifie the Practice, or to extenuate the Crime.

Let them keep on their Sheeps Cloathing, and preach and pray as long as they may, until their Tongues are weary, and their Hearers Ears too; they'll preach more to Hell, I firmly believe, than they will to Hea|ven, while they continue in &s;aid Prac|tice.</P>
<P>For Cu&s;tom in Sin, hides, covers, as it were takes away the Guilt of Sin. Long Cu&s;tom, the Conveniency of Slaves wor|king for us, waiting and tending conti|nually on us, be&s;ide the Wa&s;hing, clean|ing, &s;couring, cooking very nicely fine and curious, &s;ewing, knitting, darning, almo&s;t ever at hand and Command; and in other Places milking, churning, Chee&s;e-making, and all the Drudgery in Dairy and Kitchin, within doors and without. And the proud, dainty, lazy Daughters &s;it with their Hands before 'em, like &s;ome of the wor&s;t idle Sort of Gentlewomen, and if they want a Trifle,

rather than ri&s;e from their Seats, call the poor Slave from her Drudgery to come and wait upon them.

<P>Now, dear Friends, behold a My&s;tery! The&s;e Mini&s;ters that be Slave-keepers, and are in &s;uch very great Repute, &s;uch eminent Preachers, given to Ho&s;pitality, charitable to the Poor, loving to their Neighbours, ju&s;t in their Dealings, tem|perate in their Lives, vi&s;iting of the Sick, &s;ympathi&s;ing with the Afflicted in Body or Mind, very religious &s;eemingly, and extraordinary devout and demure, and in &s;hort &s;trictly exact in all their Deco|rums, except Slave-keeping, the&s;e, the&s;e be the Men, and the Women too, for the Devil's purpo&s;e, and are the choi|ce&s;t Trea&s;ure the Devil can or has to bring out of his Lazaretto, to e&s;tabli&s;h Slave-keeping. By the&s;e Satan works Wonders many ways. The&s;e are the very Men, or People of both Sexes, that come the neare&s;t the Scribes &amp; Phari&s;ees of any People in the whole World, if not &s;incere: For the Scribes were exact and

demure &s;eemingly in their Appearance before Men, according to Chri&s;t's Ac|count of them, and yet the wor&s;t Ene|mies the dear Lamb had, or that the Devil could procure for or again&s;t him. And I do &s;urely believe that one &s;uch as the&s;e, now in this our Day, in this very Country, does more Service for the De|vil, and Hurt in the Church, in Slave-keeping, than twenty Publicans and Har|lots: For by their extraordinary Con|duct, in Hypocri&s;y, &s;mooth and plau&s;i|ble appearance, they draw into the Snare almo&s;t in&s;en&s;ibly, and &s;o beguile un&s;table Souls before they are aware, which is &s;orrowful to con&s;ider as well as write, their Example being much more powerful than others.</P>
<P>And Friends, what I touched at a lit|tle before, concerning the delicate Dam|&s;els, or fine idle Dames, it may be pret|ty much like it with the young Men, and may be the old ones, that have their Negroes to Plow, &s;ow, thre&s;h, winnow, &s;plit Rails, cut Wood, clear Land, make Ditches and Fences, fodder Cattle, run and fetch up the Hor&s;es, or fine cu|rious pacing Mares, for young Madam and Sir to ride about on, impudently and proudly go&s;&s;iping from Hou&s;e to Hou&s;e,
<PB N="31" REF="004149_0030_1003DE0498A357B0">
&s;tuffing their lazy ungodly Bellies. Then old Sir Ma&s;ter calls, <HI>Negro, fetch my be&s;t Gelding quickly, for me to ride to Meeting, to preach the Go&s;pel of glad Tydings to all Men, and Liberty to the Captives, and o|pening the Pri&s;on-Doors to them that are bound; but I'll keep thee in Bondage never|thele&s;s, help thy &s;elf if thee can. I charge thee to work very hard when I am gone, and be&s;ure be very ready to wait on me &amp; my Children when we come home, if they come with me, or el&s;e wait till they do come, and then take their Hor&s;es, and look well after them; and then make ha&s;te in, all of ye, and be ready to wait upon us, and keep good Fires above &s;tairs or below, and mind your Bu&s;ine&s;s well, or I'll take a Cour&s;e with you; don't think that I'll give</HI> 70 <HI>or</HI> 80 l. <HI>apiece for you, for nothing but to ly la|zying about like Gentlemen, doing nothing, you &s;hall work now you are young, for when you are very old, you will not do much, I &s;uppo&s;e, and then you mu&s;t be maintained, you and your Wives and Children and Chil|dren's Children; and if you dont behave your &s;elves well, you'll be but badly pro|vided for, I believe, when you are pa&s;t your Labour, whatever you are now.</HI></P>

and aro&s;e in my mind, in Love of Truth, that if our Slave-Keepers had been, or now would be faithful to God, the Truth, and would bring up their Negroes to &s;ome Learning, Reading and Writing, and endeavour to the utmo&s;t of their power in the &s;weet Love of Truth to in&s;truct and teach 'em the prin|ciples of truth and righteou&s;ne&s;s, and learn them &s;ome Hone&s;t Trade or Im|ployment, and then &s;et them free; and all the time Friends are teaching of them let them know that they intend to let them go free in a very rea&s;onable time: and that our Religious Principle will not allow of &s;uch Severity, as to keep them in everla&s;ting Bondage and Slavery.</P>
<P>This might according to my way of thinking, beget &s;uch Love and Tender|ne&s;s in them, toward their Ma&s;ters or Mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, and to the ble&s;&s;ed Truth for their Sakes; that it might be a means to convince &s;ome of them.</P>
<P>And &s;hould they come to receive the pure Truth, in the Love of it; as, ble&s;|&s;ed be the Lord, many of us have, and in that &s;weet Love, which is con&s;train|ing, come under a concern and nece&s;&s;ity, to go and vi&s;it their Brethren, of their own colour, and Country, and Language,

and preach the Go&s;pel of eternal Salva|tion unto them, from Sin and Captivity, both of Body and Soul, this would be a glorious work indeed, and well worth our Friends pains, charge and time, that they might &s;pend about it; and the be&s;t compen&s;ation to God and Man, as I think, that they can po&s;&s;ibly make, for being &s;o long in a practice that has &s;o much Wickedne&s;s attending of it con|tinually.</P>

<P>The many Hundreds of Thou&s;ands, that are now in Slavery, were they at Liberty, as we are, had the &s;ame Edu|cation, Learning, Conver&s;ation, Books, &s;weet Communion in our Religious A&s;|&s;emblies; I believe many of them would exceed many of their Tyrant Ma&s;ters in Piety, Virtue and Godline&s;s; and their bright Genius, which I know they have, would be inlivened; for I have conver&s;t with many of them, for Liberty is Life, and Slavery is Death, nay the very

<P>WHEN I have mildly rea&s;oned with &s;ome Friends concerning their Ho&s;tility, in carrying a Per&s;on or Friend, if I may call him &s;o, out of Meetings &s;o often, and keeping of him out by Con&s;table and other ways; as at <HI>Philadelphia, Burlington</HI> and <HI>Concord, &amp;c.</HI> without &s;o much as pretending they have u&s;ed any Go&s;pel Order with him, in any Monthly or Quarterly Meeting, as a di&s;|orderly Per&s;on.</P>
<P>O But &s;ay &s;ome, he is a very trouble|&s;ome Per&s;on, and has been &s;o for many Years; and is too cen&s;orious about Trading in Slaves, or again&s;t Traders in, and Keepers of Slavers; And po&s;itively affirms, that no Man or Woman, Lad or La&s;s ought to be &s;uffered, to pretend to Preach Truth in our Meetings, while they live in that Practice; which is all a Lie.</P>
<P>And further, he boldly affirms, that no Per&s;on what&s;oever has any Right, or ought according to Truths Di&s;cipline,
<PB N="64" REF="004149_0063_1003DECB6E14C4A8">
to be &s;uffered to have the Rule and Go|vernment, or any Part of it, in the Church of God, which is the Kingdom of God, while he him&s;elf is in League with the Devil, and is managing the Affairs of his Kingdom, which Slave Trading is, as has been proved.</P>
<P>But &s;ome that have not, and will not keep Negroe Slaves of their own, may &s;ay, we mu&s;t not be too cen&s;orious, for we are often at their Hou&s;es, and Eat and Drink bravely, and have their Negroes to wait on us, our Hor&s;es, Wives and Children.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>Dear Friends,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I remember about 40 years ago I kept my elder Brother's Sheep, and the pret|ty Lambs and their Dams would be qui|etly &s;weetly and prettily feeding toge|ther, a very beautiful and comely Sight to &s;ee. But if a Stranger, my Friends, the Stranger, came near with his Dog, (the Dog &s;ucks the Blood which is the
<PB N="132" REF="004149_0131_1003E090C814DCE8">
Life of the Sheep) and if this Dog fell a barking yawling or howling, among the Sheep and the pretty pretty dear Lambs, immediately they leave their Feeding, and run for their dear Lives; &s;o they would be &s;catter'd, and &s;catter'd, altho' there was or might be a great Flock of them together. Sometimes, I mu&s;t con|fe&s;s, I have been a little carele&s;s and &s;leepy like &s;ome other Shepherds, and then the Sheep would go wandring about over Hedge and Ditch, and get into my Neighbour's Corn, and do Mi&s;chief; and then it was very hard for me to get them out of the Corn and into order again. Sometimes it would co&s;t me many Tears before I could get them into order again. Sometimes if the Sheep and Lambs were not gathered together before Night, in the Night in the Dark the Dog would come and bite many of them, and &s;uck their Blood, and &s;ome he would kill; &s;o then that would be a Grief to the Own|er, and a Reproach to the Shepherd.</P>
<P>So, my very dear Friends, you that are the right true Shepherds, that love the Sheep more than all things in this World, you can very ea&s;ily make an Application, for it is your Life and Delight to take Care of your Father's Sheep, and his
<PB N="133" REF="004149_0132_1003E0959F62A718">
Lambs e&s;pecially, and are grieved when the Dog, the Dog, the Blood&s;ucker, does but bark, and hinder them from Feed|ing. I know what I write, ble&s;&s;ed be the Name of the good and great Shep|herd, for evermore, who laid down his Life for his Sheep and Lambs.</P>
<P>My dear faithful Friends, you are much e&s;teemed by me, and your Unity in the Father in his Kingdom, which is his Church, is much more de&s;ired by me than all things in this World, I can tru|ly &s;ay. It has been much in my Mind for a con&s;iderable time, to lay before you my Concern for having &s;ome of our an|cient worthy Friends Epi&s;tles of Warn|ing, Reproof, Caution, and Advice to Mini&s;ters, collected and reprinted; ap|prehending it may be of &s;ome Service to have a Collection of &s;uch as I have mentioned, or &s;uch as you &s;hall think will be of mo&s;t Service; I earne&s;tly de|&s;ire and entreat to have your Advice and Coun&s;el; for I know right well that in the multitude of Coun&s;el there is Safety, e&s;pecially with them dear Friends that know the Truth and are faithful; the&s;e are the be&s;t Coun&s;ellors in the whole World.

<P>THE Thing appeared very clearly as at other Times, that <HI>Slave-keeping,</HI> with all its Concomitants, was the wor&s;t Idol, and one of the greate&s;t Marks of the Apo&s;tacy, in the whole World, and the very wor&s;t Part of the great Whore's Merchandi&s;e, My&s;tery Babylon, the Mo|ther of Whores.</P>
<P>At this Time al&s;o it is brought to my Remembrance, with great Thankfulne&s;s to my deare&s;t God and Father, Redeem|er and Pre&s;erver, the great Liberty that I with many Thou&s;ands more enjoy in this good Land, which to many wi&s;e &amp; right con&s;iderate People, is much more valuable than natural Life; e&s;pecially our religious Liberty; with the Plenty of all good Things needful for the Body, which many hundreds of Thou&s;ands have been and are deprived of, by the above|named vile&s;t, gro&s;&s;e&s;t and blacke&s;t of all Abominations.

<P>THis Morning very early it &s;prung a|gain afre&s;h and very lively in my Mind, concerning Marriages made in the &s;weet Love, Fear, Wi&s;dom and Coun&s;el of the almighty living Lord God and eternal Father in Heaven, if we want Riches and Honour, Plea&s;ure and Joy: What is comparable to tho&s;e Marriages made only in the Lord, in the Church, in Heaven, in the Temple; but few &s;uch Marriages I fear are to be found now a Days, that are made by the Fa|ther in Heaven, which is the Truth. But abundance of Marriages are made by the Father in Hell, the Devil, which is out of the Truth: Made by the Lu&s;t of the Eye, the Lu&s;t of the Fle&s;h, and Pride of Life, and for Covetou&s;ne&s;s to maintain them, which is all of him that is an Enemy to all Mankind, the Devil

<P>And &s;o it was among&s;t the Primitive Chri&s;tians, about the Time of the Ten Per&s;ecutions, when they gat a little Ea&s;e from the Heathen Tyrants, the apo&s;tate Chri&s;tians went to the &s;ame devili&s;h Work, of murthering and butchering the true Chri&s;tians, about their Creeds, keeping of Ea&s;ter, and other Idols, and about the Clau&s;e of one Sub&s;tance and two Sub&s;tances, as if the eternal Being could be divided; But e&s;pecially after <HI>Con&s;tantine</HI> the Roman Emperor was converted to the Chri&s;tian Faith, in his Zeal he gave &s;uch large Donations and Revenues to the Church, that it is re|corded, the &s;ame Day there was a Voice heard from Heaven, crying aloud, <HI>This Day is Poi&s;on poured into the Church!</HI> which the Event &s;oon after verified.

<P><HI>Dear</HI> John, <HI>this Morning I was in my Garden pulling up &s;ome Weeds, it came in my mind what was objected again&s;t me lately, by one that mini&s;ters among&s;t us</HI> N. A. <HI>and hath done near</HI> 20 <HI>Years; that I was for &s;etting up &s;ome Mini&s;ters, and pulling down others, Now,</HI> Dear Friend, <HI>I mu&s;t confe&s;s I do not approve of a fal&s;e Mini&s;ter, much le&s;s to &s;et him up, neither would I pull down the True by no means, nor touch the truely anointed to do them any harm, for they are very near to my Life I can truely &s;ay without any re&s;erve, and I hope ever will be while I have a Being, But if one &s;hould a&s;k any Friend, even a fal&s;e Mini&s;ter him&s;elf, if we might at any Time receive, &s;hould or ought to encourage a fal&s;e Mini&s;ter, or approve, join and unite with him in Prayer or in his Te&s;timony, he would an&s;wer in the Negative, no, no, if not for
