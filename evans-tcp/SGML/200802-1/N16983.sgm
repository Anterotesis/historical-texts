<HEAD>ALTE EXTULISTI, UT GRAVIUS RUEREM. Sen. in Oct.</HEAD>
<P>THE defects of the old Articles of Confederation were uni|ver&s;ally felt, and acknowledged, and a di&s;&s;olution of the federal Compact appeared to be the inevitable con&s;equence, of a pertinacious adherence, to a &s;y&s;tem &s;o inadequate. It neither provided the means of internal &s;afety, nor external defence. A truth &s;o apparent, that tho&s;e who oppo&s;e the pre&s;ent &s;y&s;tem, do not rely on the old "Articles of Confederation:" but as there is no alternative, boldly a&s;&s;ert that a di&s;&s;olution of the Union, would be preferable to an efficient federal Government.</P>
<P>The indulgence of a candid Audience, is therefore reque&s;ted, while we revert to the enquiry, Is an efficient federal Govern|ment e&s;&s;ential to the peace and happine&s;s of this country?</P>
<P>I am &s;en&s;ible that a &s;ubject which has been &s;o often handled, like a thrice told tale, palls upon the &s;en&s;e: Yet as I cannot chu&s;e my field, and as the path is pointed out in which I mu&s;t follow&mdash;their patience is &s;olicited: and be&s;ides, however irk&s;ome the di&s;|cu&s;&s;ion, the &s;ubject is of importance.</P>
<P>My audience will likewi&s;e pardon the many inaccuracies which will appear, in a ha&s;ty di&s;&s;ertation; as many circum&s;tances pre|vented an attention to the &s;ubject till within a &s;hort time.</P>
<P>The de&s;ign of goverment is to protect the life and property of the &s;ubject, and that government be&s;t an&s;wers the purpo&s;es of its in&s;titution which mo&s;t effectually &s;ecures the enjoyment of the&s;e; with the lea&s;t po&s;&s;ible impeachment or diminution.</P>
<P>The rea&s;ons which urge to an Union, go to the very e&s;&s;ence of government, and involve in them the only means of providing for our external &s;ecurity and defence, or our internal &s;afety and peace.</P>
<P>An exten&s;ive ocean, it is true, &s;eparates the ea&s;tern, from this we&s;tern hemi&s;phere, and many from thence infer, that nature has placed between them an in&s;uperable barrier; and that our poli|tical mea&s;ures &s;hould have no reference to the mea&s;ures there pur|&s;ued. But has &s;he placed an in&s;uperable barrier between their commercial intere&s;t, and ours? or has &s;he re&s;tricted the objects of ambitious pur&s;uit? In the fir&s;t divi&s;ion of the &s;ubject, the protec|tion of commerce &s;trikes the mind, as an object peculiarly important.</P>
<P>In the pro&s;ecution of this, our ve&s;&s;els are already lead to traver&s;e &s;eas contiguous to the dominions of every maritime power in Eu|rope; and to circum&s;cribe the globe. And what can protect the adventurers in &s;uch exten&s;ive pur&s;uits, from the in&s;ults of the haughty, the re&s;trictions of the de&s;igning, or the depredations of the lawle&s;s; but a re&s;pectable national character, and a &s;ufficient national force?</P>
<P>That the potentates of Europe are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of this haughty de|meanor, I need not a&s;&s;ert; nor that many of the&s;e look with a jealous eye, on the ri&s;ing greatne&s;s of this country, as being one

day capable of rivaling and perhaps &s;upplanting them in their mo&s;t favorite plans of commerce. The&s;e from motives of pride, rival&s;hip, and intere&s;t, will oppo&s;e its progre&s;s. And what na|tion will &s;ubmit to the in&s;ults of the haughty, the impo&s;itions of the de&s;igning, or the depredations of the lawle&s;s, merely from a jealou&s;y of each other? Americans will not. What has encour|aged the exactions and impo&s;itions to which we have been oblig|ed to &s;ubmit, but our own weakne&s;s! What, but this, has em|boldened a ne&s;t of pirates on the Barbary coa&s;t, to capture our merchantmen, and ma&s;&s;acre their crews, or drag them into a &s;la|very wor&s;e than death!&mdash;Do not the lives, and &s;ufferings of our countrymen, (thus ma&s;&s;acred and en&s;laved) call aloud for indig|nation and vengeance, rather than for the &s;tipulated reward of treacherous cruelty!</P>
<P>While a contracted policy, and jealou&s;y induce the powers of Europe to tolerate&mdash;to fo&s;ter in their bo&s;oms &s;uch &s;tains to huma|nity; the Union will enable America to wipe them from the e&s;|cutcheon of mankind.</P>
<P>I am &s;en&s;ible that many of the advocates for the power of anni|hilation, aware of the truth and force of the&s;e ob&s;ervations, &s;trike at the root, and deny the nece&s;&s;ity of commerce&punc; and would con|&s;ider the people of this country&mdash;
<Q><L>"As fix'd like plants to &s;ome peculiar &s;pot,</L>
<L>To &s;uck nutrition, propagate and rot"&mdash;</L></Q></P>
<P>But why has the Almighty implanted in their brea&s;t, the &s;pirit of enterprize; which no people in the univer&s;e &s;eem to po&s;&s;e&s;s in a higher degree? And from whence are we to be &s;upplied with the various exotic productions, which are not merely conducive to the enjoyment, but to the pre&s;ervation of life? Were we to de|pend on a precarious importation from foreigners, we &s;hould find our&s;elves much more in their power than we now are; and oblig|ed to &s;ubmit to frauds and impo&s;itions, both as to value and qua|lity, of their merchandize. Unable to furni&s;h our&s;elves, they would &s;end &s;uch as would an&s;wer no other markets; and in &s;uch &s;canty &s;upplies as to demand their own price. Be&s;ides the produce of our country, tho' of the mo&s;t &s;ub&s;tantial kind, is &s;uch as almo&s;t every country affords, and foreigners might not find &s;uch a want of this as to induce the nece&s;&s;ity of an application here. E&s;peci|ally as tho&s;e powers, who are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of adjacent territory, would, for the purpo&s;es of emolument to them&s;elves, and detriment to us, endeavour to &s;upply every market with the avails of their own co|lonies.</P>
<P>By re&s;tricting commerce, we &s;hould cut off the life and &s;ource of indu&s;try; and pave the way for indolence, and a train of vices more de&s;tructive to community, than tho&s;e arts of elegance and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span">it is &s;aid, and ju&s;tly &s;aid) are the concomitants <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> people will rai&s;e more than is &s;ufficient for

their own con&s;umption, and to &s;upply the demands of foreign markets. To evince this, I appeal to tho&s;e countries, which by their &s;ituation, are &s;ecluded from the benefits of commerce, or which have not the &s;pirit to avail them&s;elves of their local advan|tages: Such being generally &s;unk in ignorance, effeminacy and vice. And to what cau&s;e are we to impute the di&s;parity ob&s;erva|ble between the improved nations of Europe, and the mo&s;t igno|rant Horde of Tartars, or the mo&s;t effeminate people of China or India, but to that &s;pirit of enterprize, which animates the inter|cour&s;e of the former, and a de&s;titution which &s;inks the latter be|low the level of man?</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t &s;tages of &s;ociety, and when uncivilized by the arts of refinement, mankind are in a &s;tate of ho&s;tility, and wage war as uniformly as the bea&s;ts of the fore&s;t engage. Ancient Europe, and modern America, afford &s;triking &s;pecimens of this. To me|liorate the ferocity natural to the human mind, to enlarge its fa|culties, to eradicate local prejudices, and to extend the principles of toleration, are the effects of commercial intercour&s;e.</P>
<P>A communication with foreign powers, will on the principle of an equilibrum, attract from countries over &s;tock'd with inhabitants, and thus prove a fruitful &s;ource of population an object of the greate&s;t importance in a territory of &s;uch exten&s;ive limits. But without an efficient federal government, even this would not take effect, as tho&s;e who have been accu&s;tomed to a regular admini&s;tra|tion, con&s;ider a permanent &s;y&s;tem as of the utmo&s;t importance, and the &s;ecurity of property as the great object of &s;ociety. Nor can our commerce be retrieved, or placed on a re&s;pectable footing, but by general mea&s;ures wi&s;ely concerted and &s;trictly adhered to.</P>
<P>The Briton on the North, the Spaniard on the South, and the Savage on the We&s;t, add weight to the&s;e &s;ugge&s;tions, and &s;peak more forcibly the nece&s;&s;ity of uniting.</P>
<P>It is to little purpo&s;e to &s;ay that we are &s;eparated from the two fir&s;t by a watery tract of three thou&s;and miles extent; when by their territorial claims in this country they are bro't to our neigh|bourhood. By means of the&s;e it will be more peculiarly in their power to annoy our trade, and ob&s;truct our fi&s;heries, which, if protected, might prove the means of &s;upport to the indu&s;trious, and a &s;ource of wealth to the community. And have they not &s;hewn a di&s;po&s;ition to avail them&s;elves of every circum&s;tance to our di&s;advantage? They prohibit us the navigation of the &s;eas and the entrance of rivers common to both; they exclude us their harbours; and to enforce the&s;e mortifying re&s;trictions, &s;eize our ve&s;&s;els with in&s;tances of conduct the mo&s;t cruel and unju&s;t, and e|ven in&s;ult our weakne&s;s by withholding tho&s;e places ceded to us by the treaty of peace, and which might be &s;ome &s;ecurity again&s;t further encroachments. "If the&s;e things are done in the green tree, what will be done in the dry!" If the&s;e things are done when we
<PB N="6" REF="021887_0005_0FB5E7D14FEECFC8">
are in &s;ome mea&s;ure united, what may we not expect when di&s;uni|ted and perhaps contending among our&s;elves? Our apprehen&s;ions will be further awakened on this &s;ubject when we con&s;ider, that by their increa&s;e of power in the&s;e &s;ettlements which continually populate, they may at &s;ome future period endanger our exi&s;tence as &s;tates.</P>
<P>The dread of the &s;avage tribes extends, at pre&s;ent, no farther than to tho&s;e places immediately expo&s;ed to their predatory in|cur&s;ions. At &s;ome future period however, they may excite a more &s;erious alarm. Their dominion is even now over empires &s;till unexplored, and they po&s;&s;e&s;s all that devoted attachment to the national cau&s;e, that martial enthu&s;ia&s;m and patience of fatigue which have always con&s;tituted the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential ingredients in mi|litary atchievement. 'Twas thus the Romans were invincible, and by the&s;e united with a religious zeal, the Moors, the Arabs, and the Saracens form'd that irre&s;i&s;tible torrent, which under Ma|homet and his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, with a de&s;olating force over&s;pread half the world. And the want of effect &s;o con&s;picuous in the pre&s;ent operations of the &s;avage tribes, ought to be imputed more to their want of union, and con&s;equent de&s;ultory mode of attack, than to any other cau&s;e; but &s;hould &s;ome Tamerlane ari&s;e among their &s;cattered Hordes, they might &s;till be formidable, e&s;pecially if a&s;|&s;i&s;ted by the neighbouring powers.</P>
<P>Such are the dangers which threaten from without; and &s;hall we tamely &s;ubmit to every exaction, and neglect to provide the means of defence; or &s;hall we not avail our&s;elves of our own na|tural advantages?&mdash;That general mea&s;ures only can operate ef|fectually to the&s;e great purpo&s;es, and that an efficient federal go|vernment is nece&s;&s;ary in concerting or enforcing a compliance with the&s;e, is evident from the conduct of the &s;tates even during the war. In times of danger, individual intere&s;t is forgotten in the general concern. And the war we &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e would have been a &s;ufficient memento to the &s;tates to act in concert and in conformity to the general mea&s;ures: Yet this was not found &s;uf|ficient. Many of the &s;tates during the period of the utmo&s;t dan|ger, were totally regardle&s;s of the general intere&s;t and &s;afety&mdash;&s;eeking amid&s;t the common calamity to promote their own parti|cular views, and to e&s;tabli&s;h claims in them&s;elves unju&s;t, and leaving the &s;tates de&s;titute of the means of &s;upporting even defen|&s;ive operations, (&s;uch was the contrariety of intere&s;ts) and tho&s;e &s;eeds of di&s;affection and di&s;&s;ention had then taken root, the rapid growth of which has &s;ince occa&s;ioned the mo&s;t &s;erious alarm.</P>
<P>And &s;uffer me now to call your attention to tho&s;e con&s;iderations which come &s;till nearer, and which ari&s;e within the &s;tates them|&s;elves.</P>
<P>"Neighbouring nations," &s;ays a writer of note, "are natural enemies to each other." Jealou&s;y of power, and contrariety of
<PB N="7" REF="021887_0006_0FB5E7D366ACE100">
intere&s;t are &s;ufficient to awaken an apprehen&s;ion of injury, and ex|perience proves how often this ri&s;es into action; to which &s;ource may be traced almo&s;t every war of which hi&s;tory treats. And the more nearly they are connected, the more inveterate is their ani|mo&s;ity; unle&s;s there exi&s;ts a general power as a common arbiter. Greece, while divided into di&s;tinct &s;tates, and till &s;ubjected by a foreign power, exhibited a continued &s;cene of horror, blood&s;hed and confu&s;ion. England during the Heptarchy, and England &amp; Scotland till the Union, exhibited a &s;imilar &s;cene. But not to multiply examples from the &s;ame cau&s;es, may we not expect &s;imi|lar effects? And ought we not to u&s;e every precaution to guard again&s;t &s;uch an event? War is dreadful! but &s;hield thou Guar|dian Power this country from the horrors of civil di&s;cord! And when we find in addition to tho&s;e which generally exi&s;t, many cau&s;es of di&s;&s;ention peculiar to the&s;e &s;tates; our apprehen&s;ion of the con&s;equences, and endeavors to guard again&s;t the&s;e &s;hould be proportionably increa&s;ed. A rival&s;hip in trade, and the impo&s;ts and exactions of particular &s;tates, would prove no incon&s;iderable &s;cource of animo&s;ity. The territory ceded to the Union by the treaty, would be an object, and probably the &s;ubject of contention. The interfering claims of different &s;tates to the &s;ame territory would lead to a &s;imilar i&s;&s;ue. The general debt of the confede|racy both from the mode of adju&s;tment, and mode of payment, would involve many difficulties; the inability of &s;ome &s;tates, the di&s;affection or di&s;hone&s;ty of others, would each occa&s;ion deficiences &amp; delays, which would excite the clamors of dome&s;tic creditors, and the re&s;entment of &s;tates more punctual in their engagements; while foreign creditors would probably &s;peak a more energetic language, and by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of national authority, re&s;ort to a compul&s;ory recompence.</P>
<P>It is &s;ugge&s;ted, that there can be no danger of a war between the&s;e States, as they could derive no advantage therefrom. Nor are the combatants in private quarrels benefited thereby; yet both &s;tates and individuals will re&s;ort the <HI>ultima ratio.</HI> But wars it is &s;aid are undertaken to gratify the ambitious projects of a few, and the people have no concern in their origin. I believe we &s;hall find, however, that mo&s;t wars have originated, from the di&s;|po&s;ition of the people; who&s;e re&s;entment generally anticipates the views of their rulers; &amp; often contrary to their wi&s;h, precipitates them into mea&s;ures in conformity thereto. In&s;tances of this oc|cur frequently in the hi&s;tory of England and other countries. This &s;pirit is mo&s;t prevalent in popular governments, and the&s;e mo&s;t frequently undertake wars from petty provocations and trifling cau&s;es, being more under the influence of turbulence and faction. The examples of Greece, Carthage, the &s;tates of Italy, and the United Netherlands, authorize this a&s;&s;ertion. It is again, howe|ver urged, that from the mild effects of the Chri&s;tian Religion, or from &s;ome other cau&s;e, the ferocity of mankind is &s;oftened, and
<PB N="8" REF="021887_0007_0FB5E7D6886D49A0">
that they are much le&s;s inclined to war than in former ages.&mdash;I have heard of an individual, but never of a national Chri&s;tian, and the frequent and recent in&s;tances which we have of the con|trary di&s;po&s;ition in the examples above refer'd to, and others which might be adduced, &s;ufficiently refute the a&s;&s;ertion, and prove that mankind are &s;till the &s;ame.&mdash;But we come now to the great &s;pecific of the&s;e political quacks&mdash;the people of the&s;e States (&s;ay they) are too wife, and ju&s;t to contend with each other. Altho' the Utopian idea of the reign of rea&s;on and perfect ju&s;tice is long &s;ince exploded; yet the&s;e vi&s;ionaries adopt an idea equal|ly ab&s;urd. A review of the conduct of the States, and the &s;ituati|on of the country when the Convention met, will correct this er|roneous hypothe&s;is, and furni&s;h additional motives to embrace the Union. The total neglect of particular &s;tates, even in time of danger, to provide their quotas for the common defence, di&s;co|ver'd the folly, of mere requi&s;ition. An avoidance of many of the articles of the treaty, by &s;everal &s;tates, involved the re&s;idue in the di&s;agreeable con&s;equences of a fre&s;h breach of national faith; &s;hewed how far their political hone&s;ty might be relied on, and would at &s;ome future period have been attended with more &s;eri|ous effects; and I wi&s;h this State did not ju&s;tly come under the imputation. In fine, the ruin of our trade, our &s;hip-yards de&s;ert|ed, our harbours without &s;hipping, the lo&s;s of public credit, the poverty of our country, and the burdens of the day, were but a &s;mall part of the catalogue of our di&s;tre&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>The political horo&s;cope wore a mo&s;t threatening a&s;pect&mdash;the cloud of di&s;content hung over our heads like the flaming &s;word over the devoted city; and the ru&s;hing, rough bla&s;t of commoti|on already progno&s;ticated, the bur&s;ting of the &s;torm! States &s;tood watching with eager looks, and waiting for the &s;ignal of on&s;et; and had, e'er this, un&s;heated their &s;words in their divi&s;ions again&s;t each other, or in their rebellions again&s;t them&s;elves. Anarchy, with his many heads, and Di&s;cord, with her flaming torches, were di&s;|covered in all their gha&s;tly &s;hapes, and the welkin involv'd in a darker gloom, pre&s;ented in pro&s;pect, the country de&s;olated with all the horrors, and di&s;tre&s;&s;es of civil war! But the recital is pain|ful&mdash;And hide, oh! hide from view, the hideous group! and &s;ee the curtain drop&mdash;the &s;pirit of conciliation hovers o'er the land! and the Sun of union has ari&s;en!</P>
<P>Such, and many additional rea&s;ons which might be &s;ugge&s;t|ed <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> the nece&s;&s;ity of an efficient federal government. The objections to such a &s;y&s;tem will now claim your attention.</P>
<P>"That the &s;y&s;tem is new, and that every innovation is dangerous and detrimental," like many &s;ugge&s;tions of bigoted form-wife politicians, ari&s;es from want of information; or that incorrigible temper which induces its votaries to reject every improvement of modern date; and every truth which their grand mothers have not taught them.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="021887_0008_0FB5E7D755D46CB8">
It is from this principle that certain nations &s;till adhere to tho&s;e prepo&s;terous cu&s;toms, which their fore-fathers had practi&s;ed. It is from this principle that the di&s;ciples of Mahomet &amp; Confucius reve|rence the chapter of the Sheep, and believe in the doctrine of the Ave&s;ta,&mdash;The thunders of the Conclave and the flames of the In|qui&s;ition were long level'd at the germe of inquiry &amp; blighted the expanding bud: And even the inventors or abettors of the true &s;y&s;|tem of the univer&s;e were oblig'd to renounce the di&s;covery as a dangerous here&s;y.</P>
<P>This di&s;po&s;ition will equally arre&s;t the progre&s;s of arts and the progre&s;s of truth: rea&s;on becomes the dupe of prejudice, deducti|ons vain, and every di&s;qui&s;ition civil or religious ends in thus it has been held and &s;o believed. Nothing &s;o much as this prevents man from being as perfect as rea&s;on can make him; nothing &s;o much as this the univer&s;al &s;pread of truth. When, Oh when &s;hall the time arrive that the inhabitant of the Ganges and the Rio de la Plate &s;hall acknowledge the &s;ame belief! then &s;hall prejudice, bigotry and illu&s;ion be di&s;&s;ipated, this and this &s;hall be the reign of truth!</P>
<P>'But why (it is &s;aid) &s;hould we wi&s;h for a change of &s;y&s;tem, &s;ince no people in the univer&s;e are happier than were the people of the&s;e, and of this &s;tate in particular, under the former arrange|ment?' A change of circum&s;tances renders nece&s;&s;ary a change of mea&s;ures. We were formerly a minor under the tuition of a guar|dian; we are now an independent &s;tate; and the other &s;tates are alike &s;ituated: we mu&s;t now con&s;ider, and treat them, for &s;uch will be their conduct to us, as rivals in intere&s;t and power, or as equals and confederates. We have found how totally inadequate the former &s;y&s;tem of confederation has proved; and how many objects of rival&s;hip may ari&s;e. Should we not therefore endeavour to avoid the mi&s;chiefs which we have experienced, and others which may en&s;ue? And why &s;hould the accidental or arbitrary lines drawn by Great-Britain, in the divi&s;ion or di&s;tribution of this country &s;till be adhered to, if found inconvenient? Is it to gratify a prepo&s;terous habit or attachment? or to &s;ub&s;erve the pur|po&s;es of certain individuals, intere&s;ted in the continuance of the &s;tate e&s;tabli&s;hments?</P>
<P>'The territory of the&s;e States, (&s;ay the objectors) is too large for a republican form of government.' That a republican form of government, is calculated only for &s;mall di&s;tricts, is an idea de|rived by not attending to the di&s;tinction between a democracy, and a republic.</P>
<P>In a democracy, the people deliberate in a body; in a repub|lic, they may act by their repre&s;entatives. There are many writers, and among tho&s;e of modern authority, Monte&s;quieu, Hume, Price, Adams and others, who point out a republic, or a confederated republic, as the mo&s;t eligible form of government, for an exten&s;ive territory.</P>

"But how (it is &s;aid) will the people know tho&s;e whom they elect to office." To obviate this, the choice may be, and in fact by the pre&s;ent Con&s;titution, is made by di&s;tricts or &s;tates. And the acquaintance which tho&s;e appointed have with each part of the Confederacy, will enable them to judge of the re&s;ources of each.</P>
<P>'That no general rule of taxation can be devi&s;ed, to operate equal|ly thro' the &s;tates,' is an objection which may be made, to every mode of taxation, in the mo&s;t petty di&s;trict; and in the pre&s;ent in|&s;tance is premature. The re&s;ources of the confederated whole, will be con&s;iderable, by the &s;ale of the unappropriated lands&mdash;by impo&s;ts &amp; other &s;umptuary regulations, which to the &s;eparate &s;tates, or to the &s;tates when divided into partial confederacies, would be &s;unk to noth|ing, for want of &s;ome general rule of collection, or which would be wor&s;e &s;quandered in a contention to decide the right, or rather the power of appropriation: for in &s;uch ca&s;es the power would com|monly decide the right. By an oeconimical application of the&s;e re&s;ources, direct taxation for the exigencies of the union may be avoided. Nor is it an idea that it will be nece&s;&s;ary, unle&s;s on &s;ome unfore&s;een emergency, which it is hoped will never take place.</P>
<P>In an&s;wer to the&s;e, &s;ome of the advantages of an exten&s;ive, con|federate republic will be adverted to, and on this &s;ubject the ve|nerable Monte&s;quieu ob&s;erves, "There is a kind of government po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of all the internal advantages of a republic and external force of a monarchy. This is a confederate republic, being a convention, by which &s;everal &s;maller &s;tates agree to become mem|bers of a larger one, and is an a&s;&s;emblage of &s;ocieties capable of increa&s;ing by new a&s;&s;ociations.</P>
<P>A republic of this kind, able to with&s;tand external force, may &s;ub&s;i&s;t without internal corruption, and by its form, prevents all manner of inconveniencies.</P>
<P>The intrigues of party will not influence public deci&s;ions, as in a &s;mall di&s;trict; nor has an individual that opportunity to rai&s;e him&s;elf above the controul of the law. "Should a popular in|&s;urrection happen in one of the confederated &s;tates, the others are able to quell it. Should abu&s;es creep into one part, they are re|formed by tho&s;e that remain &s;ound." And &s;uch a government, compo&s;ed of &s;mall republics enjoys the internal happine&s;s of each."</P>
<P>But why, (it may be a&s;ked) if &s;uch are the advantages, of an exten&s;ive, confederate republic, have we not more frequent in|&s;tances of the&s;e, among the nations of the world?&mdash;It would be an herculean ta&s;k, unle&s;s every circum&s;tance favour'd the event, to per&s;uade the people of any exten&s;ive territory, to &s;ubmit to an uniform plan, or &s;y&s;tem of government. So uncertain the popu|lar deci&s;ion, and &s;o different their opinions, on the mo&s;t common, and yet intere&s;ting &s;ubjects. Of this we had &s;ufficient evidence in the late public deliberations; in which, however, a remarkable co|incidence
<PB N="11" REF="021887_0010_0FB5E7DEAE3095C0">
of circum&s;tances occur'd. By contra&s;ting the &s;itua|tion of this, and other countries, we &s;hall find rea&s;ons which would here ju&s;tify the wi&s;h, and would there preclude the po&s;&s;ibility of &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>Here a &s;imilarity of language prevailed; there a confu&s;ion or contrariety of languages &s;oon took place; &s;trong prejudices and local attachments had not here taken root, as was the ca&s;e with other countries at a much earlier period than that of which hi&s;tory treats; here the people were at liberty to deliberate; there the people were &s;hackled with de&s;potic forms, and bound in chains be|yond the po&s;&s;ibility of reprieve, before government was con&s;idered as an art; before they had deliberated on the &s;ubject, or even con&s;idered them&s;elves as intere&s;ted in the deci&s;ion. Here a gene|ral toleration of religious &s;entiment and an uniformity of princi|ple was a mo&s;t happy omen. There &s;y&s;tems of bigotry and a &s;pirit of intolerance had early clo&s;ed the avenues of coalition. Yet even there Henry the Great, and Fourth of France, and Elizabeth, of illu&s;trious memory, form'd the plan of a confederate republic, com|prehending the powers of Europe. Happy would it have been for mankind had this &s;y&s;tem of philanthropy taken place; it would have done away that contracted policy, and by con&s;tituting a com|mon arbiter, have eradicated tho&s;e &s;eeds of jealou&s;y, which had before, and which have &s;ince involved the nations in many a bloody conflict.</P>
<P>If &s;uch the happy concurrence of circum&s;tances, how unpardon|able &s;hould we be to neglect the pre&s;ent opportunity to e&s;tabli&s;h the peace and freedom of an exten&s;ive continent? Such an event, by creating a balance in favor of univer&s;al liberty, would con&s;ti|tute America the common arbiter and avenger of the injured rights of mankind, and con&s;train the kings and rulers of the earth to "reign with more mildne&s;s and mercy."</P>
<P>Some, however, object to the form of the confederacy, and a&s;|&s;ert, 'that a connexion with the &s;outhern &s;tates will precipitate us into many di&s;agreeable con&s;equences.' We &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e by the language held forth on this occa&s;ion, that any corre&s;pondence with them would be attended with a contagious effect; but experience on the trial di&s;covers advantages both political and moral in the union.</P>
<P>'Their ideas of government, it is &s;aid, are carried much beyond our principle or ability.' This objection, like many others, is un|founded in fact, and made to excite the apprehen&s;ions of the unin|formed. Were not the governments in the &s;outhern and northern &s;tates equally democratical? and are they not equally &s;o at the pre&s;ent time, and the &s;pirit of the people equally oppo&s;ed to the en|croachments of an Ari&s;tocracy?</P>
<P>It is &s;aid, "they are depraved." In every country indeed there is a mixture of the virtuous and vicious&punc; but are tho&s;e who &s;ug|ge&s;t
<PB N="12" REF="021887_0011_0FB5E7DF9D118740">
this without a fault?&mdash;Precious immaculates!&mdash;But you are not obliged to contract from them their vicious habits, either by a moral nece&s;&s;ity, or by the articles of the compact!</P>
<P>To correct, however, an opinion &s;o erroneous, as that the Southern States are remarkably depraved, we need only point to the many exemplary, and illu&s;trious characters, who from that part of the union, during the late war, guided the councils of A|merica; and directed her arms. And among the&s;e we contem|plate with plea&s;ure, the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;h'd ornament of the pre|&s;ent age, his country's boa&s;t; and &s;ince the my&s;tic, Heaven's be&s;t gift to man.</P>
<P>"They are rich" it is &s;aid, "and we poor." But do we not find the &s;ame &s;implicity of manners generally prevalent thro' the whole? and is not the uniformity &s;urpri&s;ing, making allowance for the difference of climate, and the frequent acce&s;&s;ion of foreign|ers there made?&mdash;Are they not brothers,&mdash;bone of our bone, and fle&s;h of our fle&s;h, for many of their leading men are from a|mong us; &s;peaking the &s;ame language, and differing le&s;s than people of the &s;ame di&s;trict often differ in other countries? In|deed, I con&s;ider the difference which &s;ub&s;i&s;ts, as a happy circum|&s;tance. We can &s;upply each other with the productions of every climate; if they are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a more profitable &s;taple, and import more freely, we &s;hall partake of the benefits of an impo&s;t ari&s;ing therefrom: they will add to our re&s;ources, and we &s;hall add to their &s;trength. Be&s;ides, erecting di&s;tinct confederacies, would be creating powerful rivals; and pre&s;enting them with arms, which &s;oon they would plunge to each others hearts.</P>
<P>"But this will induce" it is &s;aid, "the nece&s;&s;ity of paying the national debt." And have they the effrontery to urge this as a rea&s;on again&s;t its adoption? If it will enforce a compliance with the calls of ju&s;tice and humanity, it will, and certainly ought to have the &s;ufferage of every hone&s;t mind; a neglect of which has already deprived the decrepid, the widow, and the fatherle&s;s, of that pittance for which they had &s;uffered&mdash;for which their hu&s;|bands and fathers had bled; and con&s;trained them to pine in &s;i|lence, and &s;olitude, the want of that little all; which altho' it could not have dried their tears, might have relieved their di&s;|tre&s;s. May the time arrive, when their acknowledgements &s;hall ari&s;e, like incen&s;e before the throne of the great Avenger of wrongs, and with the effu&s;ions of gratitude, wa&s;h away the record of their &s;ufferings!</P>
<P>"But the tendency of this &s;y&s;tem, &s;ay its oppo&s;ers, is to form a national character, and to give the&s;e &s;tates a degree of impor|tance and weight with the other powers, and no nation which is or aims to be great can be happy."&mdash;Be little and be happy, is their motto. I had always imbibed an idea, that a good charac|ter was beneficial both to nations and to individuals. If to be
<PB N="13" REF="021887_0012_0FB5E7E12526ECE0">
contemptible and in&s;ignificant contributes to their felicity, they are in the direct road to the accompli&s;hment of their wi&s;hes: God grant, however, that this country may never practi&s;e the princi|ples which they inculcate." "But is not this (they a&s;k) a mere bubble, in which the great body of the people are not intere&s;ted, and by which a few only are benefited?" A national character is the &s;oul of &s;ociety, and each individual feels its influence; it is like blood to the human body of which every part partakes.&mdash;And ill betides the &s;tate who&s;e meane&s;t &s;ubject is not jealous of her' rights, and emulous of her glory: it is the firme&s;t bulwark of the commonwealth.&mdash;The ideas of a Roman and his country were in|&s;eperable; and a Briti&s;h tar will &s;acrifice his life for the honor of Old-England. Now is the &s;on of Columbia deaf to her calls? follow him to his cottage which he has rear'd by his indu&s;t|ry, and from which he has taught the fore&s;t to retire; is not this dear to him? would it be &s;o if under the de&s;pot of Con&s;tantinople, or dey of Algiers? And is it not doubly dear for his country's &s;ake? View him in the little circle of his family and neighbours; he recounts the names of tho&s;e who have done honor to their country; he recites their actions; and derives an importance from the re|cital. Name the injuries which his country has received, his cheek glows with indignation, and he flies forth to meet the ag|gre&s;&s;or: mention the deed of &s;hame in which &s;he bore a part, he hangs his head, the con&s;cious blu&s;h pa&s;&s;es over his countenance; it is the blu&s;h of &s;hame. Re&s;t in peace thou hone&s;t &s;on of indu&s;t|ry, and may the con&s;cious blu&s;h again ne'er tinge thy cheek. Maye&s;t thou enjoy the fruits of thy labour, and &s;acred may they remain. Nor &s;hall thy hard earnings be applied to &s;upport an idle pageantry and a voluptuous court: for not &s;uch will be the con&s;equence of an in&s;titution, form'd equally to promote your happine&s;s and &s;ecurity.&mdash;May thy country &s;till be dear, and long maye&s;t thou remain her &s;trength and pride.</P>
<P>"But it will involve us in all the maze of European politics."&mdash;In which in&s;tance, however, are we mo&s;t likely to become dupes to the policy of other powers, in our &s;eparate capacity, or under the pre&s;ent &s;y&s;tem? This que&s;tion, from the ob&s;ervations which have been made, and others which will occur, admits of an ea&s;y &s;olution. As di&s;tinct &s;tates we &s;hould neither maintain a digni|ty of conduct, or independence of character; we &s;hould be the puppets of the play, play'd off again&s;t each other for the amu&s;e|ment of the performers, and to &s;ub&s;erve the purpo&s;es of tho&s;e con|cern'd in the management of the &s;cene.</P>
<P>But here the appointment of Amba&s;&s;adors, Placemen, and Pen&s;ioners, is like a hedious apparition, conjured up to di&s;turb the di&s;ordered imaginations of the&s;e political knights-errant; and which, Quixote like, they encounter with all fury and for|mality of the Wind-mill Brethren. Unfortunately for them,
<PB N="14" REF="021887_0013_0FB5E7EACCC8ACB0">
but fortunately for us, the reality does not exi&s;t under the pre&s;ent &s;y&s;tem: for the &s;y&s;tem has not begun its operation: and there is no clau&s;e providing that &s;uch an arrangement &s;hall take place. The appointment of amba&s;&s;adors and other officers will be under the direction of tho&s;e whom we &s;hall con&s;titute, and will not take place but for the general good. If unnece&s;&s;ary offices have been e&s;tabli&s;h'd the&s;e may be aboli&s;h'd: and we tru&s;t in the wi&s;dom and integrity of our Rulers, to le&s;&s;en as much as po&s;&s;ible, the burdens of the day; and to guard again&s;t every unnece&s;&s;ary impo&s;ition.</P>
<P>The rapid progre&s;s of the &s;tates in improvements of every kind, the in&s;titution of cities, and the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the Cincinnati, are likewi&s;e call'd forth from the dark cavern of jealou&s;y and &s;u&s;|picion to frighten and intimidate the weak; and with as much propriety and judgment as many &s;illy people call on Grey-beard and Bloody-bones to frighten their children. Were &s;uch ground|le&s;s apprehen&s;ions to govern our deci&s;ion, we &s;hould endeavor to arre&s;t the progre&s;s of every improvement, and relap&s;e as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible into a &s;tate of nature.&mdash;It is not the introduction of arts, it is not the progre&s;s of improvement which accelerates the ruin of kingdoms, and the di&s;&s;olution of empires; but the&s;e are their &s;ure&s;t &s;upport. And in conformity to this &s;entiment, an ob&s;erv|ing foreigner &s;peaking of the American Revolution remarks, That it exhibits at one point of view, the experience of age, with the hone&s;t energy of youth.</P>
<P>How the late in&s;titution of cities has or can prove unfavorable to liberty, except that of the bri&s;tly herd, I am unable to di&s;co|ver; perhaps it was on that ground that the objection aro&s;e. How far the matchle&s;s pen of a&mdash;might be able to effect a revolution in favor of that much injured &s;pecies of animals, I will not pretend to &s;ay. It would at lea&s;t be employed with as lit|tle detriment to the peace and good order of &s;ociety, as on &s;ome late occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>And why thou di&s;ciple of Edanus, this wanton attack on the members of a &s;ociety, the idea of which is founded in patrioti&s;m and benevolence? Is it their characters again&s;t which you object? Their characters are as much above the &s;hafts of your cen&s;ure or calumny, as the utmo&s;t effort of my prai&s;e or approbation. Or would you wi&s;h Americans to revive the puni&s;hment of the O&s;|traci&s;m, and pro&s;cribe every virtue?&mdash;This alas would be a cruel retribution for tho&s;e &s;ervices, by which they have e&s;tabli&s;hed the freedom of their country, and their own immortal fame!</P>
<P>Is it the in&s;titution which you di&s;approve? This is &s;acred to the offices of friend&s;hip and humanity.&mdash;After a &s;eries of &s;ervices and common danger, the fatigues of which they had endured with a patient fortitude, &amp; which had endeared them to each other; might they not at the moment of &s;eparation indulge the &s;ad, but &s;oothing

reflection, that they &s;hould again meet, with at lea&s;t &s;ome of the companions of their &s;ufferings? when they might renew the image of former days, or drop the tear of &s;ympathy to the memory of tho&s;e who&s;e hearts no longer beat with the thrillings of &s;ocial joy; and who were no longer &s;een in the circle of the brave! At the thre&s;hold of this in&s;titution &s;tand benevolence and humanity, and ca&s;t the pitying eye and &s;tretch the liberal hand to the nece&s;&s;itous, to the companion in want, to the widow, and to the orphan in di&s;|tre&s;s.</P>
<P>Or is it the conduct of the&s;e which excites the cen&s;ure? "I ve|nerate," &s;ays the &s;ame philanthropic foreigner, "the &s;oul of a WASHINGTON, that great man, whom our fooli&s;h opinions and ideas of fal&s;e glory, have never led one &s;tep beyond that patriotic barrier which he had pre&s;cribed to him&s;elf: And who having drawn his &s;word to defend his country, had crown'd the durable pyramid of his immortal fame; and rai&s;ed his greatne&s;s to the mo&s;t elevated pitch in the very act of abdicating it. He may be called the fir&s;t of the American Cincinnati: I love the idea of this in&s;titution."</P>
<P>It comprehends, in one view, the duty of the &s;oldier, and the citizen, who when his country no longer calls, di&s;claims the pro|fe&s;&s;ion of arms; and in the retired walks of life, di&s;plays the &s;ame virtue which had di&s;tingui&s;hed the rougher &s;cenes.&mdash;How far they have conform'd to the idea of the in&s;titution, and to the example of their great patron, let candour decide: and even prejudice mu&s;t allow, that a paralel in&s;tance of decency, order, oeconomy, and willing indu&s;try, in a di&s;banded army, cannot be adduced in the annals of hi&s;tory!</P>
<P>And &s;uffer me now to addre&s;s my&s;elf more particularly to you.&mdash;And do you really con&s;ider it, as &s;uch a misfortune to the coun|try, that the new government was adopted before your return from Europe, and before you had an opportunity to give your opi|nion of its expediency? Unhappy event! But perhaps even this might not have varied the i&s;&s;ue; &amp; to confe&s;s the truth, we do not &s;ee either in your arguments and deductions, or your mode of manag|ing the &s;ubject, any very conclu&s;ive rea&s;ons to alter the deci&s;ion. You &s;et out with a pompous declaration of what you intend and promi&s;e &s;omething to a&s;toni&s;h, and in&s;truct, before you con|clude. "Mons parturit" let the di&s;cerning public determine, how far the &s;equel, is applicable to your performance.</P>
<P>With great frankne&s;s, and genero&s;ity you offer your&s;elf to the oppo&s;ition, with the mode&s;t re&s;erve however, of guiding their mea|&s;ures, and heading the attack. But have a care, le&s;t by a&s;piring too high, you rai&s;e jealou&s;y in minds peculiarly inclined thereto. Nor have you e&s;tabli&s;hed your claim to &s;uch a pre-eminence, by a long &s;ervice, and a faithful adherence to their cau&s;e: And as yet they would hardly know where to find you, for it is proble|matical

from your premi&s;es and conclu&s;ions on which &s;ide the &s;cale of your rea&s;oning would preponderate; the purport and amount of which is, that the pre&s;ent &s;y&s;tem was formed by great and wi&s;e men, &amp; ought therefore to be rejected; and that tho&s;e only who are de&s;titute of wi&s;dom and ability, can be &s;afely tru&s;ted;&mdash;that tho&s;e who compo&s;ed the late Convention, have &s;erved their country with fidelity, and therefore cannot be confided in&mdash;that the Society of the Cincinnati, is a dangerous in&s;titution, becau&s;e compo&s;ed of men to whom their country is under the highe&s;t obligation: that the federal &s;y&s;tem is unexceptionable, and therefore a dangerous con+&s;piracy again&s;t the liberties of the people&punc; and la&s;tly, that the people have voluntarily adopted it, and are therefore oppo&s;ed in heart and &s;entiment to it.

Altho' by &s;uch vagaries, you might equal the flights of a Sheridan, or a Burke, and &s;how the agility of your imaginati|on, it will not e&s;tabli&s;h your character for &s;olidity; and is a mere balloon experiment.

<P>While you arraign, at your mock tribunal, tho&s;e who merit the love and e&s;teem of all good men, and cen&s;ure their mea&s;ures with|out colour of argument, you di&s;cover a total want of &s;en&s;ibility of character, or decency of conduct; and in&s;ult the feelings and good &s;en&s;e of an audience, who have di&s;covered their warme&s;t ap|probation of both.</P>

of party, intere&s;t, and pa&s;&s;ion&mdash;the demagogue of Faction has bow'd his neck&mdash;it has &s;wept away the wall of partition between the States&mdash;it has blended the views of all in one general object. And certainly the &s;uffrages of an applauding continent are no incon&s;i|derable criterion of its merit; for I revere, and &s;hall always re|vere the &s;entiments of a people who are e&s;teemed, and ju&s;tly e&s;|teemed the mo&s;t enlightned, and be&s;t informed, even in this en|lightned age: and who have the &s;en&s;e to mark with &s;ilent contempt the incoherent rants, and ejaculations of expiring faction, tho' glo&s;s'd by the &s;pecious pretext of zeal for their &s;afety, aided by the pomp of &s;ound, and enforced by the energy of theatrical ge&s;ture.</P>
<P>The thread-bare cant of the danger of tru&s;ting men with power which they will &s;ooner or later inevitably pervert to the purpo&s;es of oppre&s;&s;ion, and of the tendency of all governments to de&s;poti&s;m, would operate equally again&s;t every &s;y&s;tem, and de&s;erves to be treated as the mere art of a popular declaimer, and rai&s;e him&s;elf to notice.</P>
<P>When, however the &s;ugge&s;tions of danger come nearer, &amp; it is al|ledged 'that Congre&s;s are by the pre&s;ent &s;y&s;tem inve&s;ted with powers which they may abu&s;e,' we are induced to ob&s;erve, and the expe|rience of mankind evinces, "that in all Democracies there is a tendency rather to anarchy in the members, than to tyranny in the head."&mdash;The factions of Carthage, prevented her furni&s;h|ing Hannibal with nece&s;&s;ary &s;upplies, and &s;aved the Roman pow|er, the con&s;equences of which were fatal to her&s;elf.&mdash;The po|pular influence in Rome, gain'd a continual a&s;cendant.&mdash;The a|bolition of the regal authority, and the repeated diminutions of the rights and prerogatives of the nobles, and &s;enate, were but &s;o many &s;acrifices at the popular &s;hrine, till at length the turbulence of faction raged without controul, and paved the way for the introducti|on of the Imperial power.&mdash;The People within the pre|&s;ent age, have plucked many a darling gem from the crowns of their European Potentates.</P>
<P>It would be happy for mankind if they could live without the re&s;traints of government.&mdash;It would likewi&s;e be happy if their temperence and health, and their di&s;po&s;ition to rectitude, pre|cluded the nece&s;&s;ity of phy&s;ical, or moral a&s;&s;i&s;tance: but while they are imperfect in their moral perceptions and natural habits, both the teacher &amp; the phy&s;ician are nece&s;&s;ary; and while under the in|fluence of intere&s;t and pa&s;&s;ion, the re&s;traint of law; and each of the&s;e are calculated to &s;upply in &s;ome mea&s;ure, the natural, the moral, and the political <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> of mankind.</P>
<P>Every tru&s;t implies a ri&s;que, and it is in the power of each cha|racter above referred to, and of all in whom we confide, to abu&s;e the confidence, if they will de&s;cend to the meane&s;s and treache|ry of &s;uch a conduct. And as the &s;ole alternative to obviate the danger in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance, tho&s;e &s;hould be &s;elected and ap|pointed

<P>The ti&s;&s;ue, repre&s;enting the hi&s;tory of the world, has a varie|gated appearance; it is &s;haded with the crimes of tho&s;e who have perverted power to the mo&s;t pernicious purpo&s;es: it is likewi&s;e erradiated with the virtues of &s;uch as have exerted this in the exerci&s;e of the mo&s;t benign philanthropy, whereby they merited the e&s;teem, and were the delights of mankind.</P>

<P>And may we not hope that &s;uch will be the bright a&s;&s;emblage exhibited in the part re&s;erved for the hi&s;tory of this, and coming ages?

<P>It is ours to decide, whether the plea&s;ing pro&s;pects entertain'd in con&s;equence of the pre&s;ent &s;y&s;tem, &s;hall be realiz'd, or not: and whether we &s;hall ble&s;s, or reprobate the day of its adoption&mdash;for much remains to be done. Indu&s;try, oeconomy, and a true &s;pirit of patrioti&s;m can alone retrieve the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of our &s;ituation, and relieve us from the burdens under which we labour, in con&s;equence of a heavy and ruinous war. And it is above all, incumbent on us to appoint faithful watchmen on the walls of our Jeru&s;alem! Ma|ny are plotting to counteract the beneficial influence of every mea|&s;ure.&mdash;Certainly &s;tronger motives could never operate on the minds of Rulers, and induce to an unwearied, and &s;elf-devoted ap|plication to the duties of their appointment, than at the pre&s;ent cri&s;is. We have been witne&s;&s;es to &s;cenes peculiarly &s;triking, and which lead to others &s;till more important and deci&s;ive.&mdash;The at|tention of mankind is fixed on the event, and the happine&s;s of numbers exceeding the powers of conception, depends on the i&s;&s;ue. How unfortunate! &s;hould they by an ill-judged exertion of the prerogatives with which they are nece&s;&s;arily inve&s;ted, excite the &s;pirit of di&s;content; cloud the pro&s;pect; &amp; di&s;appoint &s;o fair a hope?&mdash;Let them pur&s;ue the golden mean which we have always pur|&s;ued, and then in return we can a&s;&s;ure them of the affection, and gratitude of a people, who by a chearful, and ready compliance with the nece&s;&s;ary requirements of government, will &s;till further promote the happy effects of a &s;y&s;tem, which we fondly flatter our|&s;elves will continually progre&s;s towards perfection, and fix at length the civil compact 'on the broad ba&s;is of rea&s;on.'</P>
