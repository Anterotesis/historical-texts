<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THOUGH the Journals already publi&s;hed, were printed with|out my Knowledge, yet as GOD has been plea&s;ed to let me &s;ee, by Letters &s;ent to me, that he has greatly ble&s;&s;ed them, I now upon the Importunity of Friends, con|&s;ent to the publi&s;hing a Continu|ation of them, that tho&s;e pious Per&s;ons who have interceded in my Behalf, may &s;ee what GOD, in an&s;wer to their Prayers, has done for my Soul.</P>

I am &s;en&s;ible that this, as well as every Thing el&s;e of &s;uch a Na|ture, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily meet with great Contempt from natural Men, who are Strangers to the Influ|ence of the HOLY GHOST up|on the Heart. But what have I to do with them?

<HEAD>A CONTINUATION OF Mr. WHITEFIELD's JOURNAL, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>SUNDAY, <HI>May</HI> 7. Arrived at <HI>Savannah</HI> Town about &s;even this Evening, and joined in Prayer, and a P&s;alm of Thank&s;giving with Mr. <HI>Dela|motte,</HI> and &s;ome pious Souls that were rejoiced at my Arrival: <HI>The Good LORD &s;anctify our Meet|ing to his Glory, and his People's Welfare.</HI></P>
<P>Spent the Remainder of the Evening in taking &s;weet Coun&s;el with Mr. <HI>Delamotte,</HI> who &s;eems pro|videntially left behind at <HI>Savannah</HI> again&s;t my com|ing. How &s;weetly does Providence order Things for us! <HI>Oh may I con&s;tantly follow it as the wi&s;e Men did the Star in the Ea&s;t.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Monday, May</HI> 8. Begun to read pubilck Prayers, and expounded the &s;econd Le&s;&s;on at five in the Morn|ing to &s;eventeen Adults and twenty five Children. <HI>May GOD open their Hearts that they may attend to the Things that were &s;poken.</HI></P>
<P>In the Afternoon, Mr. <HI>Cau&s;lon</HI> &s;ent Word, that he and the Magi&s;trates would wait upon me, but I cho&s;e rather to wait upon them, I was received
<PB N="6" REF="004855_0003_100E02B819CF0288">
with great Civility, and our chief Conver&s;ation ran upon the Place of my Settlement; at la&s;t it was re&s;olved that I &s;hould have a Hou&s;e and Tabernacle built at <HI>Frederica,</HI> and &s;erve at <HI>Savannah,</HI> when, and as long as I plea&s;ed. I find there are many Di|vi&s;ions among&s;t the Inhabitants, but GOD, I hope, will make me an In&s;trument of compo&s;ing them: <HI>Grant this, O Lord, for thy dear Son's Sake.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sunday, May,</HI> 14. After another Week's Confine|ment, by the Return of my Fever, under which God &s;hewed me great Mercies, and which went off with a Fit of the Ague, I attempted to read Prayers, but was &s;o exceeding faint and weak, that I was obliged to leave off before I begun the &s;econd Service. <HI>Oh that my Friends had &s;een me at that Hour, they then might have learnt not to have any Man's Per&s;on in Admiration, and not to think more highly of me than they ought to think.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Tue&s;day, May</HI> 16. Having by the Ble&s;&s;ing of GOD gotten a little Strength, I went to &s;ee <HI>Tomo Chachi,</HI> who, I heard, was near expiring at a Neighbour's Hou&s;e. He lay on a Blanket thin and meagre, and little el&s;e but Skin and Bones. <HI>Senauki</HI> &s;at by fanning him with &s;ome <HI>Indian</HI> Feathers. There was no body that could talk <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> &s;o I could only &s;hake Hands and leave him.</P>
<P><HI>Friday, May</HI> 19. GOD &s;till &s;trengthening me more and more, I went this Morning to two little Villages, <HI>Hamp&s;tead</HI> and <HI>Highgate,</HI> about Five Miles off <HI>Savannah:</HI> The former con&s;i&s;ts of three&punc; Fami|lies, making in all eleven Souls, one Man a <HI>Jew;</HI> two Men, one Woman and &s;even Children <HI>Swi&s;&s;ers.</HI> I was much delighted with &s;eeing the Improvements
<PB N="7" REF="004855_0003_100E02B819CF0288">
a few pair of Hands had made in their re&s;pective Plantations, and was &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee what Indu|&s;try will do. Surely they &s;peak not Truth, who &s;ay that the <HI>Georgia</HI> People have been idle; for I never &s;aw more laborious People than are in the&s;e Villages. They live exceeding hard, but with a little A&s;&s;i&s;tance may do very well. I was at a Lo&s;s, becau&s;e I could not talk <HI>French;</HI> but how|ever I re&s;olved, under GOD, to follow my worthy Predece&s;&s;or's Example, and to vi&s;it them once a Week, and read Prayers to as many as could under|&s;tand me. I al&s;o enquired into the State of their Children, and found there were many who might prove u&s;eful Members of the Colony, if there was a proper Place provided for their Maintenance and Education. Nothing can effect this but an Orphan-Hou&s;e, which might ea&s;ily be erected at <HI>Savannah,</HI> would &s;ome of tho&s;e that are rich in this World's Good, contribute towards it. <HI>May GOD in his due Time, &s;tir up the Wills of his faithful People, to be ready to di&s;tribute, and willing to communicate on this commendable Occa&s;ion.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Saturday, May</HI> 20. Went once more to &s;ee <HI>Tomo Chachi,</HI> hearing his Nephew <HI>Tooanoowee</HI> was there, who could talk <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> I de&s;ired him to enquire of his Uncle, Whether he thought he &s;hould die; who an&s;wered, He could not tell&punc; I then a&s;ked, where he thought he &s;hould go after Death? He replied, to Heaven. <HI>But alas, how can a Drunkard enter there!</HI> I then exhorted <HI>Tooanoowee</HI> (who is a tall proper Youth) not to get drunk, telling him, he under&s;tood <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and therefore would be pun|i&s;hed the more, if he did not live better. I then
<PB N="8" REF="004855_0004_100E02B9FA48E9E8">
a&s;ked him, Whether he believed a Heaven? He an|&s;wered, Yes. I then a&s;ked, Whether he believed a Hell? and de&s;cribed by pointing to the Fire; he replied, No, From whence we may ea&s;ily gather how natural it is for all Mankind to believe there is a Place of Happine&s;s, becau&s;e they wi&s;h it may be &s;o, and on the contrary, how aver&s;e they are to be|lieve a Place of Torment, becau&s;e they wi&s;h it may not be &s;o. But GOD is true and ju&s;t, and as &s;ure|ly as the Good &s;hall go into everla&s;ting Happine&s;s, &s;o the Wicked &s;hall go into everla&s;ting Puni&s;hment.</P>
<P><HI>Wedne&s;day, May</HI> 24. Went to Day to <HI>Thunderbolt,</HI> a Village about &s;ix Miles off <HI>Savannah,</HI> &s;ituated very plea&s;antly near the River, and con&s;i&s;ting of three Families, four Men and two Women, and ten Ser|vants; I was kindly received, expounded a Chap|ter, u&s;ed a few Collects, called on a Family or two that lay near our Way, and returned home to <HI>Sa|vannah</HI> very comfortably, with my Friend <HI>Dela|motte,</HI> about &s;ix o'Clock in the Evening. <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed be GOD for &s;trengthning my weak Body.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Friday, June</HI> 2. This Evening parted with kind Captain <HI>Whiting,</HI> and my dear Friend <HI>Delamotte,</HI> who embarked for <HI>England</HI> about 7 at Night. The poor People lamented the Lo&s;s of him, and went to the Water-&s;ide to take a la&s;t Farewel. And good Rea&s;on had they to do &s;o: For he has been inde|fatigable in feeding <HI>Chri&s;t'</HI>s Lambs with the &s;incere Milk of the Word, and many of them (<HI>ble&s;&s;ed be GOD</HI>) have grown thereby. Surely, I mu&s;t labour mo&s;t heartily, &s;ince I come after &s;uch worthy Pre|dece&s;&s;ors. The Good Mr. <HI>John We&s;ley</HI> has done in <HI>America,</HI> under GOD, is inexpre&s;&s;ible. His
<PB N="9" REF="004855_0004_100E02B9FA48E9E8">
Name is very precious among the People; and he has laid &s;uch a Foundation, that I hope neither Men nor Devils will ever be able to &s;hake. <HI>Oh, that I may follow him, as he has CHRIST.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Monday, June</HI> 5. Had a Conference with a certain Per&s;on of the Pari&s;h, who, I heard la&s;t Night, had been broaching many heretical Doctrines to one of my Friends, particularly in denying the Eternity of Hell-Torments. I therefore invited him this Morning to Breakfa&s;t: and after imploring GOD's A&s;&s;i&s;tance, in the Spirit of Meekne&s;s, I a&s;k'd him, Whether he believed the Eternity of Hell-Tor|ments? He an&s;wered frankly, No. I replied, What do you mean, Sir, when you repeat the twelfth Article of our Creed? He &s;aid, he believed wicked Men were to be annihilated. I then read <HI>Pear&s;on'</HI>s Expo&s;ition of the la&s;t Article, but he denied it all, &s;aid he thought him&s;elf in the right, and believed it his Duty to inform Mankind, that they were to be annihilated. Upon which I repeat|ed to him that Pa&s;&s;age out of the <HI>Revelations,</HI> <Q>If any Man &s;hall take away from, or add unto the Words that are written in this Book, GOD &s;hall take away his Name out of the Book of Life, and add unto him all the Plagues that are written in this Book.</Q> This, he &s;aid, he be|lieved. Afterwards we di&s;cour&s;ed afre&s;h, but find|ing him re&s;olute to propagate his Principles, I then told him with the utmo&s;t Calmne&s;s that I was &s;orry, that I gave him the Cup ye&s;terday at the Sacra|ment; but for the future, he mu&s;t pardon me, if I refu&s;ed ever to give it him again. This &s;taggar|ed him a little, but he bore it pretty patiently, yet
<PB N="10" REF="004855_0005_100E02BBC07CE0C0">
thought me uncharitable. But I told him I &s;hould meet him at the Judgment- Seat of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> and then he would &s;ee upon what Principles I acted. <HI>May GOD give me Grace not to regard the Faces of Men, but with an humble well guided Zeal and Cou|rage to watch the Flock over which the Holy Gho&s;t has made me Over&s;eer.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Saturday, July</HI> 10. Placed one that came with me, at <HI>Highgate,</HI> to teach the Children <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> that belong to that Village, and <HI>Hamp&s;tead.</HI> They are about twenty in all, of <HI>French</HI> Extraction, but &s;ome few of them are able to &s;peak a little in our vulgar Tongue. I thought placing a Ma&s;ter there, would be of great Con&s;equence, <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Becau&s;e I cannot think Children will ever be naturalized to the Colony, till they can talk our Language. <HI>Se|condly,</HI> Becau&s;e the pre&s;ent Generation will &s;oon wear off, and the&s;e Children being well in&s;tructed in ours, will make them forget their own Tongue, and &s;hould they marry and have Children, they would naturally teach their Children the &s;ame; &s;o that at length we &s;hall all be of one Speech. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> As they are but few in Number, and no likelihood of any <HI>French</HI> Mini&s;ter to come among&s;t them; I or my Succe&s;&s;ors &s;hall be unable to Cathe|chi&s;e or bring them to hear the Word of GOD at our Church, unle&s;s they are acquainted with the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Tongue.</P>
<P><HI>Monday, June</HI> 11. Opened a School to Day for the Girls of <HI>Savannah,</HI> a Friend, who&s;e Heart GOD was plea&s;ed to touch on Board the Ship, having at my Reque&s;t undertaken to teach them. The Work is for my Ma&s;ter, &amp; therefore I doubt not
<PB N="11" REF="004855_0005_100E02BBC07CE0C0">
not of being &s;upplied &s;ome Way or another with a &s;ufficient Fund for the Support of it. <HI>May GOD enable him who is &s;et over them to feed them with the &s;incere Milk of the Word, and give them Grace to grow thereby!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thur&s;day, June</HI> 22. Was taken (as all about me thought for Death) with a violent Purging and Vomiting, which in the Space of five Hours quite exhau&s;ted my Spirits, and brought me in appear|ance almo&s;t to the Point of Death. But GOD &s;upported me by his inward Comforts, cau&s;ed me to rejoice in it; and ca&s;t me into a deep Sleep, out of which I awoke perfectly well, to the Surprize of all about me. <HI>O who can expre&s;s the loving Kind|ne&s;s of the LORD&punc; or &s;hew forth all his Prai&s;e!</HI> My Pari&s;hioners in general &s;hewed they loved me; for they &s;eemed mo&s;t follicitous for my Welfare. For their Sake, as well as for my own, I hope GOD <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;o &s;uddenly re&s;tored me. <HI>GOD grant I may now begin to be active in my Ma&s;ter's Service, that when&s;oever he &s;hall call, I may be found &s;o doing.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Friday, June</HI> 24. To the great Surpri&s;e of my|&s;elf and People, was enabled to read Prayers and preach with Power before the Free-Ma&s;ons, with whom I afterwards dined, and was u&s;ed with the utmo&s;t Civility. <HI>May GOD make them Servants of CHRIST, and then and not till then will they be free indeed.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Friday, July</HI> 7. Being the Anniver&s;ary for open|ing the Court, I preached in the Morning at the Magi&s;trate's Reque&s;t, and endeavoured with all Plainne&s;s and Humility to &s;hew both them and the People what they ought to do to promote their Tem|poral
<PB N="12" REF="004855_0006_100E02BE0E42ECB8">
and Eternal Welfare. <HI>O GOD, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> thou ble&s;s it, and it &s;hall be ble&s;&s;ed through JESUS CHRIST.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Tue&s;day, July</HI> 11. Returned this Evening from <HI>Ebenezer</HI> (Whither I went Ye&s;terday) the Place where the <HI>Saltzburghers</HI> are &s;ettled; and was won|derfully plea&s;ed with their Order and Indu&s;try. Their Lands are improved &s;urpri&s;ingly for the Time they have been there, and I believe they have far the be&s;t Crop of any in the Colony&mdash;They are ble&s;t with two &s;uch pious Mini&s;ters, as I have not often &s;een: The<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> have no Courts of Judicature, but all little Differences are immediately and implicitly decided by their Mini&s;ters, whom they look upon and love as their Fathers. They have likewi&s;e on Orphan-Hou&s;e, in which are &s;eventeen Children, and one Widow, and I was much de|lighted to &s;ee the Regularity wherewith it is manag|ed. <HI>Oh that GOD may &s;tir up the Hearts of his Servants to contribute towards that and another which we hope to have erected at</HI> Savannah&mdash;Mr. <HI>Boltzius,</HI> one of their Mini&s;ters, being with me on <HI>Saturday,</HI> I gave him &s;ome of my Poor's Store for his Orphans, and when I came to <HI>Ebenezer,</HI> he called them all before him, catechi&s;ed and exhorted them to give GOD Thanks for his good Providence towards them; then prayed with them, and made them pray after him; then &s;ung a P&s;alm, and afterwards the little Lambs came and &s;hook me by the Hand one by one, and &s;o we parted, and I &s;carce was ever better plea&s;ed in my Life&mdash;Surely, whoever contributes to the Relief of the <HI>Saltzburghers,</HI> will perform an acceptable Sacrifice to our Ble&s;&s;ed Ma&s;ter, They are very poor; but with a little

A&s;&s;i&s;tance might live Comfortably and well. They want a Place for Publick Wor&s;hip, and Mo|ney to buy Cattle, and other Nece&s;&s;aries for the Orphan-Hou&s;e and People. <HI>May the great GOD rai&s;e up In&s;truments to a&s;&s;i&s;t and relieve them; for &s;urely they are worthy.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Tue&s;day, July</HI> 18. About ten o'Clock this Even|ing returned to <HI>Savannah,</HI> having &s;et out from thence Ye&s;terday to vi&s;it four or five Families that live at &s;ome of the outward Settlements about twelve Miles off.&mdash;Their Beginnings as yet are but &s;mall, but I cannot help thinking there are Foundations laying for great temporal and &s;piritual Ble&s;&s;ings in <HI>Georgia,</HI> when the Inhabitants are found worthy.&mdash;Ble&s;&s;ed be GOD, in <HI>Savannah</HI> they will hear the Word gladly, and People every where receive me with the utmo&s;t Civility, and are not angry when I reprove them.&mdash;<HI>May GOD keep them always thus minded, and prepare me for whatever Sufferings he &s;hall permit to fall upon me for doing my Duty.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Tue&s;day, July</HI> 25. I am now waiting for the Scout-Boat which Mr. <HI>Hortan</HI> has &s;ent to take me to <HI>Frederica,</HI> to preach the Go&s;pel there al&s;o. For therefore am I &s;ent.&mdash;I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ould part with regret from the People of <HI>Savannah,</HI> did I not know GOD call'd me from them. For they &s;eem to have a &s;incere Affection for me, and flock (e&s;pecially every Even|ing) to hear the Word of GOD.&mdash;I have endeav|oured to let my Gentlene&s;s be known among&s;t them, becau&s;e they con&s;i&s;t of different Nations and Opin|ions.&mdash;And I have &s;trove to draw them by the Cords of Love, becau&s;e the Obedience re&s;ulting from that Principle I take to be mo&s;t genuine and

<P>On <HI>Sunday</HI> Morning at five o'Clock, I publick|ly expound the &s;econd Le&s;&s;on for the Morning or Evening Service as I &s;ee mo&s;t &s;uited to the People's Edification; at ten I preach and read Prayers, at three in the Afternoon I do the &s;ame, and at &s;even expound Part of the <HI>Church Catechi&s;m,</HI> at which great Numbers are u&s;ually pre&s;ent. I vi&s;it from Hou&s;e to Hou&s;e, read publick Prayers, and expound twice, and catechize (unle&s;s &s;omething extraordina|ry happens,) vi&s;it the Sick every Day, and read to as many of my Pari&s;honers as will come thrice a Week.&mdash;And ble&s;&s;ed be GOD my Labours have not been altogether vain in the LORD. For he has been plea&s;ed to &s;et his Seal to my Mini&s;try, in a Manner I could not, I dared not in <HI>America</HI> expect. <HI>Not unto me, O LORD, not unto me, but unto thy Name be the Glory.</HI></P>

<P>In the Evening we had publick Prayers, and ex|pounding of the &s;econd Le&s;&s;on under a large Tree, and many more pre&s;ent than could be expected. <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed be GOD.</HI></P>

<HI>Wedne&s;day, Augu&s;t</HI> 9.

<P>This Evening had Prayers in a Hou&s;e which Mr. <HI>Horton</HI> hired for us during my Stay, and mo&s;t of the Inhabitants, I believe, were pre&s;ent.

<P>In the Evening, becau&s;e I was to go about Mid|night, I gave Notice I would preach as well as expound, at which almo&s;t all the Inhabitants were pre&s;ent; for many were obliged to &s;tand without the Door.

It was the fir&s;t of St. <HI>James</HI> wherein the Apo&s;tle bids us <HI>rejoice when we fall into divers Temptations.</HI> GOD enabled me to enlarge on it pretty much. I told the People that God called me and I mu&s;t away, at which &s;ome wept. <HI>Oh GOD how do&s;t thou follow me with thy Ble&s;&s;ings wherever thou &s;endeth me!

<P><HI>Sunday, Augu&s;t</HI> 13. Being di&s;appointed of going by the Boat la&s;t Night, I read Prayers and preached to my dear little Flock twice, which cau&s;ed great Joy among them. Mr. <HI>Horton</HI> was extreamly civil, and did every Thing he could to oblige me. This Afternoon after Sermon intended to go with him to preach to the Soldiers at the Fort of St. <HI>Simon'</HI>s, and then the next Day&punc; to go to St. <HI>Andrew'</HI>s, <HI>but Lord thou calle&s;t me el&s;ewhere.

An unu&s;ual Joy appear'd in their Faces at my unexpected Return, and they were ready to &s;ay, <HI>How beautiful are the Feet of him that bringeth the glad Tidings of Salvation!</HI> At Evening Prayers (and a very large Congrega|tion was pre&s;ent) I returned my dear Hearers hearty Thanks for the late In&s;tance of their &s;incere Affection, I publickly exhorted my Friend that was lo&s;t to &s;hew forth his Thankfulne&s;s not only with his Lips but with his Life, and de&s;ired their Prayers to GOD for me that I might now more and more devote my&s;elf to my Ble&s;&s;ed Ma&s;ter's Service, and &s;tudy daily to purify my corrupt Nature, that I might be made an In&s;trument under him of win|ning their Souls to GOD.</P>

<HI>Wedne&s;day, Augu&s;t</HI> 23. A Nece&s;&s;ity was laid on me to Day to expre&s;s my Re&s;entment again&s;t In|fidelity by refu&s;ing to read the Burial Office over the mo&s;t profe&s;&s;ed Unbeliever I ever yet met with&mdash;GOD was plea&s;ed to vi&s;it him with a lingering Illne&s;s, in which Time I went to &s;ee him frequent|ly.&mdash;Particularly about five Weeks ago, I a&s;ked him what Religion he was of, he an&s;wered, <Q>Re|ligion was divided into &s;o many Sects he knew not which to chu&s;e.</Q>&mdash;Another Time, I offered to pray with him, but he would not accept it, upon which I re&s;olv'd to go &s;ee him no more;&mdash;But being told two Days before he died, that he had an Inclination to &s;ee me, I went to him again, and after a little Conver&s;ation I put to him the following Que&s;tions, "Do you believe JESUS CHRIST to be GOD, the one Mediator between GOD and Man?" He &s;aid, "I believe CHRIST was a good Man."&mdash;<Q>Do you believe the Holy Scriptures? I believe, replied he, &s;omething of the Old-Te&s;tament, the New I do not believe at all. - Do you believe, Sir, a Judgment to come? he turned him&s;elf about, and replied, I know not what to &s;ay to that.&mdash;Alas, &s;aid I, Sir, if all the&s;e Things &s;hould be true&mdash;</Q> which Words, I believe gave him Concern, for he &s;eemed after to be very unea&s;y, grew delirious, and departed in a Day or two.&mdash;Unhappy Man, how quickly was he convinced that all I &s;aid was true. Now he and I are of one Mind: The Day after his Decea&s;e he was carried to the Ground, and I refu&s;ed to read the Office over him, but went to the Grave and told the People what had pa&s;&s;ed between him and

<P><HI>Thur&s;day, Augu&s;t</HI> 24. This Day went to <HI>Highgate</HI> with a Friend or two more, and read Prayers, prea|ched and baptiz'd a Child, and catechi&s;ed in a Hou&s;e lately erected by the Inhabitants. For upon my &s;end|ing a Ma&s;ter to teach their Children, one offered to give me a Part of his Lot, and the re&s;t to give their Labour. Accordingly I accepted of it, found Ma|terials, and to Day it was fit to preach in, and be made a School-Hou&s;e. The Children tho' Foreigners, an&s;wer'd admirable well, which gave me great Hopes that the other Foreign Children of the Colony may al&s;o learn our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Tongue when a proper Ma&s;ter is provided.&mdash;After Service we refre&s;hed our&s;elves toge|ther, thanked our Good GOD, and eat our Bread with Gladne&s;s of Heart.</P>
<P><HI>Sunday, Augu&s;t</HI> 27. GOD having now &s;hewn both me and my Friends that it was his Will I &s;hould return for a while to <HI>England:</HI> This After|noon I preached my Farewel Sermon, to the great Grief of my dear Pari&s;hioners, for their Hearts I found were very full as well as mine, which they expre&s;&s;ed by &s;hedding many Tears. But a &s;en&s;ible Alteration appear'd in their Countenances, when I promi&s;ed them &s;olemnly before GOD to return as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible. <HI>May GOD enable me to perform my Promi&s;e, and prepare my Way before me.</HI></P>
<P>The Weather was exceeding hot, and the Great|ne&s;s of the Congregation made it &s;till hotter, but

<P><HI>Monday, Augu&s;t</HI> 28. This being the Day of my Departure, it was mo&s;tly &s;pent in taking Leave of my Flock, who expre&s;&s;ed their Affection now more than ever. For they came to me from the Morn|ing to the Time I left them with Tears in their Eyes, wi&s;hing me a pro&s;perous Voyage and &s;afe Re|turn, and gave me other Tokens of their Love. For they brought me Wine, Ale, Cake, Coffee, Tea, and other Things proper for my Pa&s;&s;age, and their Love &s;eemed without Di&s;&s;imulation.</P>
<P>About Four in the Afternoon I went into the Boat provided for me by Mr. <HI>Cau&s;lon,</HI> who with the Recorder came to my Hou&s;e and took their Leave. A great Number of People came to the <HI>Bluff</HI> and wi&s;h'd me a good Voyage with all their Souls, and a &s;peedy Return; I thanked them, and having de|&s;ired their Prayers, ble&s;&s;ed them in the Name of GOD, and took my Leave.</P>
<P>My Heart was full, and I took the fir&s;t Opportu|nity of venting of it by Prayers &amp; Tears. I think I never parted from a Place with more Regret; for <HI>America</HI> in my Opinion is an excellent School to learn CHRIST in; and I have great Hopes &s;ome good will come out of <HI>Savannah,</HI> becau&s;e the longer I continued there, the larger the Congregations grew. And I &s;carce knew a Night, tho' we had Divine Service twice a Day, when the Church-Hou&s;e has not been near full&mdash;A Proof, this, I hope, that GOD has yet Spiritual and Temporal Ble&s;&s;ings in &s;tore for them. <HI>Ha&s;ten, O LORD, that ble&s;&s;ed Time!</HI></P>

He and &s;everal others offered me a Lodging, and were more than civil to me. <HI>How does God rai&s;e me up Friends wherever I go! Who is &s;o good a GOD as our GOD?</HI></P>
<P>Was much plea&s;ed with the Neatne&s;s of the Build|ings, and the Largene&s;s of the Place.

<P><HI>Monday, Sept.</HI> 4. Was much delighted with a Packet of Letters I received from <HI>Savannah,</HI> not only as they were a Proof of the Writer's Affection for me, but al&s;o that the Holy Gho&s;t was effectually moving on their Souls.</P>
<P><HI>Saturday, Sept.</HI> 9. Receiv'd another comfort|able Packet of Letters from <HI>Savannah</HI> Friends, and was &s;oon hurried on Board, the Wind being fair for Sailing.

<P><HI>Saturday, Sept.</HI> 16. Had contrary Winds all the Week, and got but a few Leagues from <HI>Charles-Town,</HI> yet GOD &s;hewed me great Mercies: For he enabled me to write &s;everal Things, and correct others. I have been but a little Sea-&s;ick; and though I have not had my Cloaths off, and lay upon Deck or on a Che&s;t every Night, yet the Goodne&s;s of GOD keeps me healthy and &s;trong, and gives me a feeling Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of, his Holy Spirit. My Sphere of Action is now contracted into a very narrow Compa&s;s. There are but few Souls on Board, and all that I can do is to read publick Pray|ers, and add a Word of Exhortation twice every Day, and catechi&s;e tho&s;e I brought with me. The Captain and all are very civil, my Chri&s;tian Friends have been much upon my Heart, and cau&s;ed me &s;ome Dejections, but GOD was my Comforter. Had I my own Will, I could wi&s;h my&s;elf a &s;peedy Pa&s;&s;age, that I may return the &s;ooner to tho&s;e few Sheep I have left at <HI>Savannah;</HI> but GOD knows be&s;t, and this Retirement, I hope, will break my Will, purify my Heart, and fit me for the great Work that lies before me. <HI>Even &s;o</HI> LORD JESUS, <HI>Amen,</HI> and <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Saturday, Sept.</HI> 23. Still GOD is plea&s;ed to &s;end us contrary Winds, except one Night about the Middle of the Week.&mdash;However, he enables me to give Thanks&mdash;and great Rea&s;on have I &s;o to do&mdash;<HI>For the Holy Spirit has been with me of a Truth!</HI></P>

<P><HI>Sunday,</HI> 24. <HI>Monday Sept.</HI> 25. Was oppre&s;&s;ed much in Spirit the&s;e two Days. The Wind was contrary and the Sea wrought, and was tempe&s;tu|ous; but ble&s;&s;ed be GOD, he enabled me to be re|&s;igned to his Will, this outward and inward Trial being only what was to be expected after my late A&s;&s;i&s;tances. <HI>We mu&s;t not always be upon the Mount in this Life.</HI></P>
<P>Ever &s;ince <HI>Monday</HI> Evening, GOD has been plea&s;ed to &s;end us fair Winds, particularly to Day, when our Ship has &s;ail'd &s;even Miles an Hour, <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed be GOD.</HI></P>
<P>I have been chiefly bu&s;ied about writing Letters, to engage more Labourers, and to get Contributi|ons for my poor Flock.</P>

<P><HI>Sunday, Octob.</HI> 1. Had very little Sleep all Night, and was like to fall of the Che&s;t whereon I lay &s;e|veral Times, the Sea being very rough, and the Wind turning in an In&s;tant directly contrary. <HI>Oh

that I could learn from Winds and Storms to obey my Ma&s;ter!</HI></P>
<P>Buried a young Man that came from <HI>Georgia,</HI> and died this Morning. LORD, what is Man? He &s;olaced him&s;elf with the Tho'ts of &s;eeing his Friends in <HI>England.</HI> But GOD &s;aw fit to prevent it by &s;hort|ning his Days. <HI>LORD, thy Judgments are like the great Deep!</HI></P>
<P>When I buried him, I could not &s;ay much, be|cau&s;e of the rowling of the Ship; but at Evening-Prayer I took occa&s;ion from the Le&s;&s;on (which pro|videntially was the 15th <HI>Chap.</HI> of the fir&s;t of <HI>Corin|thians</HI>) to exhort all my Ship-mates to con&s;ider &s;o, as to prepare for their latter End.

<P><HI>Friday, Octob.</HI> 6. Before I left <HI>Savannah,</HI> the Le&s;|&s;on appointed for the Morning, was St. <HI>Paul'</HI>s Ship|wreck, out of the <HI>Acts,</HI> and before I left <HI>Charles-Town,</HI> the Le&s;&s;on was the Fir&s;t of <HI>Jonah,</HI> both which made &s;uch a deep Impre&s;&s;ion upon me, that I wrote to my Friend <HI>Haber&s;ham,</HI> to acquaint him I was ap|prehen&s;ive we &s;hould have a dangerous Voyage: Since I have been on Board, what St. <HI>Paul</HI> &s;aid to his Companions, <Q>That he perceived their Voy|age would be to their great Damage,</Q> has fre|quently been pre&s;s'd upon my Heart; and GOD has now &s;hewn me wherefore he gave the&s;e previous Notices. For on <HI>Tue&s;day</HI> Night la&s;t, after we had &s;ailed 150 Miles, the la&s;t twenty Hours, about e|leven o'Clock aro&s;e a &s;udden violent <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> Wind, which continued till about Four in the Morning, and put all the Sailors to their Wits End.&mdash;Mo&s;t

of them declared they never had &s;een the like be|fore. The main Sail was &s;lit in &s;everal Pieces, and &s;everal of the other Sails, and much of the Tack|ling all to Tatters; not a dry Place was to be found in all the Ship: The Captain's Hammock, in the great Cabbin, was half filled with Water; and though I lay in the mo&s;t dry Part of the Ship, yet the Waves broke in upon me twice or thrice. In &s;hort all was Terror and Confu&s;ion, Men's Hearts failing them for Fear, and the Wind and the Sea raging mo&s;t horribly. But GOD (<HI>for ever be adored his unmerited Goodne&s;s</HI>) was exceeding gracious unto me. For I felt a &s;weet Complacency in my Will, in Submi&s;&s;ion to his. Many particular Promi&s;es GOD has made me from his Word, that I &s;hould return in Peace, flowed in upon my Heart. And he enabled me greatly to rejoice.&mdash;This is the fir&s;t Day we have ven|tured to pull down any of our dead Lights, which put me in Mind of the long Night the <HI>Egyptians</HI> once &s;aw. But I &s;pent my Time in reading, and fervent Interce&s;&s;ion for ab&s;ent Friends, and com|forted my &s;elf much with the Remembrance of them; mo&s;t of our fre&s;h Provi&s;ions are wa&s;hed o|ver Board, and our Tackling much out of Order, &s;o that we have a Pro&s;pect of but an indifferent Voyage. But ble&s;&s;ed be GOD, the Pro&s;pect plea&s;es me. For now I &s;hall learn, I tru&s;t, how to want as well as how to abound, and how to endure Hard&s;hip like a good Soldier of JESUS CHRIST. <HI>O Lord, let thy Strength be magnified in my Weak|ne&s;s, &s;ay unto my Soul, <Q>It is I, be not afraid, and then let Storms and Tempe&s;ts do their wor&s;t.</Q></HI></P>

Thus GOD's Word is in particular Ca&s;es as well as in general, a Light unto our Feet, and a Lanthorn unto our Paths.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thur&s;day, October</HI> 25. Was much comforted this Evening in reading the 33^d &amp; 34th Chapters of <HI>Ezekiel,</HI> wherein I could not but ob&s;erve many
<PB N="29" REF="004855_0014_100E02CF4043DB18">
Circum&s;tances of GOD's dealing with him corre&s;|ponding with what I have experienced in my&s;elf: The following Ver&s;es in particular were &s;et home to my Heart,&mdash;<HI>Al&s;o thou Son of Man, the Chil|dren of thy People are &s;till talking again&s;t thee by the Wall and in the Doors of the Hou&s;e, and &s;peak one to another, &s;aying, Come, I pray you, and hear what Word cometh from the LORD.</HI>&mdash;<HI>And they came unto thee as the People cometh, and they hear thy Words, but they will not do them, for with their Mouth they &s;hew much Love, but their Heart goeth after Covetou&s;ne&s;s. And lo, thou art unto them as a very lovely Song of one that hath a plea&s;ant Voice, and can play well on an In&s;trument: For they hear thy Words, but do them not.</HI>&mdash;Who that knows how GOD has dealt with me &s;ince I have been in the Mini&s;try, &s;ees not that this Pa&s;&s;age an&s;wers to my Circum&s;tances, as Face an&s;wers to Face in the Water? However, this I know, what I have &s;po|ken from GOD will come to pa&s;s (lo it will come) and then &s;hall the&s;e Scoffers and De&s;pi&s;ers know, that a Mini&s;ter of CHRIST has been among&s;t them. <HI>O that I may never be brought forth as a &s;wift Witne&s;s again&s;t any; but we mu&s;t all appear before the Judgment Seat of</HI> CHRIST.</P>
<P><HI>Saturday, October</HI> 28. Sailed about 300 Miles the four fir&s;t Days of this Week: Had a little Storm on <HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> Night, and a great Calm ever &s;ince. We are now within 150 Leagues of Land, and our Provi&s;ions and Water very &s;canty, and our Ship very weak; but the Hour of our Arrival is not yet come. <HI>Lord, Teach me to be re&s;igned and thankful, and then deal with me as &s;eemeth good in thy Sight.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="004855_0015_100E02D1978967E8">
Ble&s;&s;ed be God! he has this Week enlarged my Heart, and filled me with great Comfort, after great inward Conflicts. Is not all this to prepare me for further Trials we are yet to endure e're we get to <HI>England? LORD, thy Grace I know will be &s;ufficient for me, and therefore I rejoice in the Pro&s;pect of enduring Tribulation.</HI></P>
<P>Had Rea&s;on to believe one on board was offended at my enlarging one Night on the Sin of <HI>Drunken|ne&s;s.</HI>&mdash;I always endeavour to &s;peak with the Meek|ne&s;s and Gentlene&s;s of CHRIST.&mdash;But if People will account me their Enemy, becau&s;e out of Love I tell them the Truth, I cannot help that. <HI>Lo, I have delivered my Soul.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Monday, October</HI> 30. Still GOD is plea&s;ed that the Wind, what there is of it, &s;hould be contrary, and our Ship's Company are now brought into great Streights. Their Allowance of Water is a Quart a Day, and our con&s;tant Food for &s;ome Time has been on Salt Beef and Water Dumplins, which do not agree with the Stomachs of &s;ome among&s;t us. But GOD enables me to rejoice in that and all other our Nece&s;&s;ities, yea, He &s;o comforts me that many I believe are &s;urpri&s;ed at my Chearfulne&s;s. But when we are de&s;titute of outward Comforts, then does GOD more comfort our Souls. This Morning when I awoke, the Faith of <HI>Abraham</HI> was greatly pre&s;&s;ed upon me; and the Example of <HI>Daniel,</HI> and the three Children, who were fat and well favoured, notwith&s;tanding they were fed with Pul&s;e and Pea&s;e, is continually before my Eyes. Some &s;ay we are within a hundred Leagues of Land. But what does that &s;ignify, if GOD &s;ays, <HI>Hitherto &s;hall you go, and

no further. LORD, in thy due Time, let that which now letteth be taken away, but not before this Trial has done what it was &s;ent for, tho' it make us &s;mart.</HI></P>
<P>I warm my&s;elf by &s;miling on, and exhorting them, and this Afternoon we joined in &s;olemn Prayers &s;uitable to our pre&s;ent Circum&s;tances. <HI>LORD, let our Cry come unto Thee.</HI> I know it will, and that we &s;hall be an&s;wer'd, if it be be&s;t. But great Ble&s;|&s;ings await me on Shore, and great Trials mu&s;t pre|cede. <HI>Oh that I may by the&s;e &s;mall, be prepared for greater Sufferings. Amen, LORD JESUS.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Monday, October</HI> 30. Was comforted to-Night in my pre&s;ent Circum&s;tances, by the&s;e Ver&s;es out of this Evening's Le&s;&s;on.&mdash;<HI>I have learnt in what&s;oever State I am, therewith to be content. I know both how to be aba&s;ed, and how to abound; every where, and in all Things I am in&s;tructed, both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to &s;uffer Need. I can do all thro'</HI> CHRIST <HI>which &s;trengthneth me. Even &s;o come,</HI> LORD JESUS. Amen <HI>and</HI> Amen.</P>
<P>Reading afterwards in the Book of <HI>Maccabeus,</HI> and thinking of my pre&s;ent Situation, this Ver&s;e was pre&s;&s;ed with un&s;peakable Comfort upon my Soul. <Q>After this, they went Home, and &s;ung a Song of Thank&s;giving, and prai&s;ed the LORD in Heaven; <HI>Becau&s;e it is good, becau&s;e his Mer|cy endureth for ever.</HI></Q> I hope my Friends will take care to fulfil this when we meet together on Shore.</P>
<P><HI>Wedne&s;day, Nov.</HI> 1. This Afternoon, about 4 o'Clock, as I was in Secret, humbling my Soul be|fore GOD, interceeding for my Friends, &amp; had been praying for a fair Wind, &amp; A&s;&s;i&s;tance in the great
<PB N="32" REF="004855_0016_100E02D3BB97D048">
Work lying before me, News was brought that the Wind was fair; which put me in Mind of the Angel's being &s;ent to <HI>Daniel,</HI> to tell him his Prayer was heard, when he was humbling his Soul with Fa&s;ting, and praying for the Peace and Re|&s;tauration of <HI>Jeru&s;alem.</HI> Indeed I cannot &s;ay, I have purpo&s;ely, for the&s;e three Weeks, eat no plea&s;ant Food, or fa&s;ted, as he did; but our Food is &s;o &s;alt, that I dare eat but little, &s;o that I am now literally in Fa&s;tings often. <HI>Oh! that I may improve this ble&s;&s;ed Sea&s;on for Humiliation, and ex|traordinary&punc; Acts of Devotion, that I may be duly prepared to approve my&s;elf a faithful Mini&s;ter of</HI> JESUS CHRIST, <HI>whether by Honour or Di&s;honour, by evil Report or good Report.</HI></P>
<P>As &s;oon as we found the Wind fair, we joined in Thank&s;giving, and in &s;inging the fir&s;t Part of the 34th <HI>P&s;alm,</HI> (new Ver&s;ion) which was very applicable to our Circum&s;tances. For they tell me they have not above three Days Water on Board, allowing a Quart to each Man a Day. But he, that at one Time, at the Reque&s;t of his Di&s;ciples, con&s;idered the Multitude, and worked a Miracle for their Relief; and, at another Time, at the Interce&s;&s;ion of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> gave Water to the wandering <HI>I&s;raelites,</HI> I tru&s;t, now, has heard our Prayers, and &s;ent this Wind with a Commi&s;&s;ion to bring us where he will &s;upply all our Wants, <HI>If not, O ble&s;&s;ed</HI> JESU, <HI>thy Will be done. Give me Grace, I mo&s;t humbly be&s;eech thee, to hold out my three Watches, and at the fourth Watch I know thou wilt come. Even &s;o come</HI> LORD JESUS.</P>

pa&s;t, GOD has been plea&s;ed greatly to humble my Soul, and bring me low by &s;piritual De&s;ertions. And to-Day he has thought proper again to &s;end us a contrary Wind, bl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="4 letters">d be his Name.

<P>La&s;t Night he lifted up the Light of his ble&s;&s;ed Countenance upon me, and to Day fills me with Joy un&s;peakable, and full of Glory; &s;o that though I have little to eat, yet I inwardly po&s;&s;e&s;s all Things. I am &s;ometime afraid le&s;t continued Ab&s;tinence may occa&s;ion a bodily Sickne&s;s. But wherefore do I fear? If it does, that and every Thing el&s;e I know will work for my Good.&mdash;What I mo&s;t dread, is le&s;t any on Board &s;hould charge GOD fooli&s;hly; but I check the fir&s;t Motions I di&s;cern ari&s;ing in any one's Heart, and endeavour to ju&s;tify our good GOD, in all the Evil that he hath brought upon us. I put before them the Example of the Widow of <HI>Sarepta,</HI> and caution them again&s;t mur|muring like the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> at the Waters of <HI>Meri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ah.

<P>This is now the eighth Week I have been Aboard. If my Friends a&s;k me, why I arrived no &s;ooner, I may truly an&s;wer, <HI>Satan</HI> hindered us. For I believe it is he who is permitted to do this; but this &s;till gives me greater Hopes, that a more effectual Door than ever, will be opened in <HI>England,</HI> for
<PB N="34" REF="004855_0017_100E02D630C64848">
preaching the everla&s;ting Go&s;pel. <HI>O Satan, Satan, I defy thee to do thy wor&s;t; thou maye&s;t to&s;s me up and down, and bring me into Jeopardy on evey Side; but Je&s;us Chri&s;t is praying for me on the Mount. And when the Time appointed by the Father is come, and my Soul hereby prepared, he whom Winds and Storms obey, will &s;peak the Word; and then I &s;hall have a happy Meeting with my dear Friends!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sunday, November</HI> 5. This Day we rejoiced with trembling. For though we thereon commemorated our Deliverance from the <HI>Gunpowder-Plot,</HI> yet as our Circum&s;tances called for Acts of Humiliation, I u&s;ed Part of the Office of Commination, (be&s;ides &s;olemn Prayer and P&s;alms three Times) and enlarg|ed on the&s;e Words of St. <HI>James,</HI> <Q>My Brethren, count it all Joy, when ye fall into divers Temp|tations; knowing this, that the trying of your Faith worketh Patience: But let Patience have her perfect Work.</Q> I hope this had a good Effect upon my Hearers Hearts, and calmed their Spirits. For indeed we are brought very low: But I can &s;ay with the penitent Thief, <Q>That I &s;uffer ju&s;tly, and do not receive the ten thou&s;andth Part of the Reward due to my Crimes.</Q> <HI>Lord, remember me now thou art in thy Kingdom!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Monday, November</HI> 6. La&s;t Night, about &s;even o'Clock, GOD was plea&s;ed to &s;uffer a violent Wind to ari&s;e, which would not permit me to ri&s;e till this Afternoon, about which Time it began in &s;ome Mea&s;ure to abate&punc; Ble&s;&s;ed be GOD, through the Precaution u&s;ed by our Ship-Mates, we &s;hip'd but little Water, only we were driven &s;ome Leagues back. The Weather was pretty cold, and a little
<PB N="35" REF="004855_0017_100E02D630C64848">
Cake or two baked on the Coals, and a very little Salt-Beef was all my Provi&s;ion for the Day; but thus <HI>Elijah</HI> lived for a long while, and why not I? Nay, he fa&s;ted forty Days and forty Nights. And though I dare not pre&s;ume to do &s;o, yet if GOD &s;till brings me into greater Wants, I doubt not, but I &s;hall find that Man liveth not by Bread alone, but by every Word that proceedeth out of the Mouth of GOD. <HI>Lord, I de&s;ire not to be exempted from &s;uffering, but to be &s;upported under them. If thy Glory can be promoted by my Trials, lo, here I am, &s;courge me, try me as it &s;eemeth good in thy Sight!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Wedne&s;day, November</HI> 8. Preached my&s;elf, Ye&s;ter|day and this Morning, inwardly weak and fainting, and unable to read &s;carce any Thing. <HI>But, ble&s;&s;ed be God! though he kill me, yet will I put my Tru&s;t in him.</HI></P>
<P>When my Spirits are gone, I then find my Faith, as it were, le&s;s lively: But I tru&s;t that is only ow|ing to the Frame of my Body. For at all other Times I have great Confidence in GOD! And was he now to put it to my Choice, whether this Trial &s;hould continue, or he &s;hould &s;end us a fair Wind, I &s;hould humbly refer it to him again. <HI>For I know not what is be&s;t for me!</HI></P>
<P>Mo&s;t in the great Cabin now begin to be weak, and look hollow Ey'd, yet a little while, and we &s;hall come to Extremities; and then GOD's Arm will bring us Salvation. <HI>May we patiently tarry the LORD's Lei&s;ure!</HI> Amen, Amen.</P>
<P>Great Part of this Day I lay down, being weak and much oppre&s;&s;ed in my Head; but at Night when &s;ome doubted what the End of this Vi&s;itation would be, the following Ver&s;es were with great
<PB N="36" REF="004855_0018_100E02D9431736C8">
Comfort pre&s;&s;ed upon my Soul. <Q>For I am in a &s;trait between two, having a De&s;ire to be di&s;&s;olved, and to be with CHRIST, which is far better. Neverthele&s;s to abide in the Fle&s;h is more need|ful for you. And having this Confidence, I know that I &s;hall abide and continue with you all, for your Furtherance and Joy of Faith: That your rejoicing may be more abundant in JESUS CHRIST for me, by my coming to you again.</Q> <HI>Thus Chri&s;tians have Meat to eat, which the World knoweth not.</HI></P>
<P>In confidence of this, and &s;uch like Texts, that have been from Time to Time applied to my Soul, I &s;till, (as often as my Strength will permit) con|tinue to write Letters ready to &s;end when I come on Shore. Which reminds me of <HI>Jeremiah'</HI>s being commanded to buy Land, when his whole Country was about to be carried into Captivity. <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed are they that walk by Faith, and not by Sight!</HI></P>
<P>Though one in his Ha&s;te the other Day cried out, "What <HI>Jonah</HI> have we on Board?" And I an|&s;wer'd, I am he; yet many now, I believe, ble&s;s GOD, that I am with them. For, &s;ay they, <Q>How &s;hould we have been blaming and cur&s;ing one and other, had not Mr. <HI>W</HI>&mdash;<HI>d</HI> been among&s;t us?</Q> <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed be God, if my Mini&s;try or Pre&s;ence can be in|&s;trumental to prevent Sin again&s;t thee, O Lord, to&s;s me on the Ocean as long as it plea&s;eth thee! O my dear Lord, I de&s;ire to be re&s;igned!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thur&s;day, November</HI> 9. Enjoyed great Peace of Mind to Day, and was &s;tronger in Body than u&s;ual. <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed be the Lord!</HI> We are now making for <HI>Ire|land,</HI> and are advanced &s;ome Leagues towards it.

Whether we &s;hall arrive there or not, GOD only knows. I find all Unea&s;ine&s;s ari&s;es from having a Will of my own. And therefore I &s;imply de&s;ire to will what GOD willeth. <HI>Oh! when will this once be?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Friday, November</HI> 10. Was much &s;trengthened in our pre&s;ent Di&s;tre&s;s by the &s;econd Le&s;&s;on for the Day. It was our Saviour's turning the Water into Wine at the Marriage of <HI>Canaan.</HI> We have appli|ed to him as the Holy Virgin did, and told him in Prayer, that, "We have but very little Water?" At pre&s;ent, he &s;eems to turn away his Face, and to &s;ay, "What have I to do with you?" But this is only becau&s;e the Hour of Extremity is not yet come. When it is&punc; I doubt not but he will now as richly &s;upply our Wants, as he did theirs then. <HI>May we in Patience po&s;&s;e&s;s our Souls!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Saturday, November</HI> 11. Still we are floating about, not knowing where we are. But our People &s;eem yet to have Hopes of &s;eeing <HI>Ireland.</HI> I know not whether I am out in my Conjecture, but I imagine &s;ome of tho&s;e Ships we have &s;een, are arrived at <HI>England</HI> before us. Upon which, perhaps, my Friends will expect me, pray for me, and at la&s;t give me up for lo&s;t. <HI>And then God will re&s;tore me to them.</HI></P>
<P>The Weather now begins to be cold, &s;o that I can &s;ay, with the Apo&s;tle, <HI>I am in Hungrings and Thir&s;tings&punc; Cold and Fa&s;tings often.</HI> Hereafter, per|haps, I may add <HI>moreover in Bonds and Impri&s;onments.</HI> But I tru&s;t the Sufferings of this Life will not move me. <HI>For they are not worthy to be compared with the Glory that &s;hall be revealed in us.</HI></P>

<P>Our Ship is much out of repair, and our Food by no means, enough to &s;upport Nature in an ordi|nary Way, and that of the mo&s;t indifferent Kind too: An Ounce or two of Salt-Beef, a Pint of Water, and a Cake made of Flower and Skimmings of the Pot. But I think often on him who pre&s;erv|ed <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> in the Ark of <HI>Bulru&s;hes.</HI> And &s;o long as I look upwards my Faith will not fail.</P>
<P>Ble&s;&s;ed be GOD for the&s;e Things, I rejoice in them daily. They are no more than what I expect|ed, and I know they are Preparatives for future Mercies. <HI>GOD of his infinite Mercy humble and try me, till I am rightly di&s;po&s;ed to receive them. Amen.</HI> LORD JESUS. <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
<P>It pities me often to &s;ee my Brethren, lying in the Du&s;t, as they have done the&s;e many Weeks and expo&s;ed to &s;uch Streights: For GOD knows both their Souls and Bodies are dear unto me. But thanks be to GOD they bear up well, and I hope we &s;hall all now learn to endure Hard&s;hips, like good Soldiers of JESUS CHRIST.</P>
<P><HI>Sunday Nov.</HI> 12. This Morning the Doctor of our Ship took up the <HI>Common-Prayer Book,</HI> and ob&s;erved that he opened upon the&s;e Words, <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed be the LORD GOD of</HI> I&s;rael, <HI>for he hath vi&s;ited and redeemed his People.</HI> And &s;o indeed he has, for about 8 o'Clock this Morning News were brought,
<PB N="39" REF="004855_0019_100E02DB50FCC140">
that our Men &s;aw Land, and I went and was a joyful Spectator of it my&s;elf. The Air was clear, and the Sun ari&s;ing in full Strength, &s;o that 'tis the mo&s;t plea&s;ant Day I have &s;een the&s;e many Weeks. <HI>Now know</HI> I <HI>that the LORD will not always be chiding, neither keepeth he his Anger forever.</HI> For the&s;e two or three Days la&s;t pa&s;t, I have enjoyed uncommon Serenity of Soul, and given up my Will to GOD. And now he hath brought us Deliver|ance.&mdash;From whence I infer, that a Calmne&s;s of Mind, and entire Re&s;ignation to the Divine Will, is the be&s;t Preparative for receiving Divine Mercies. <HI>LORD evermore make me thus minded!</HI></P>
<P>As &s;oon as I had taken a View of the Land, we joined together in a Prayer and P&s;alm of Thank&s;gi|ving, and already began to reflect with Plea&s;ure on our late Streights. Thus it will be hereafter, the Storms and Tempe&s;ts of this trouble&s;ome World will &s;erve to render our Haven of eternal Re&s;t dou|bly agreeable.&mdash;I fear now nothing &s;o much as the Treachery of my Heart, le&s;t like the ungrateful Lepers, I &s;hould not turn to GOD and give Thanks by leading a Holy Life. <HI>But all Things are po&s;&s;ible with GOD, on who&s;e rich Mercies and free Grace in</HI> JESUS CHRIST, <HI>I alone depend for Wi&s;dom, Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s, Sanctification and Redemption!</HI></P>
<P>Spent a good Part of this Afternoon in walking upon Deck, and ble&s;&s;ing GOD for the Pro&s;pect I &s;aw all around me. His good Providence has been plea|&s;ed to bring us into a fine large Bay, &s;urrounded on each Side with high Lands and Hommocks, much like tho&s;e near <HI>Gibraltar,</HI> and a large Light-Hou&s;e on the Fore-Land, from which in the Evening was

Let this Day, my Soul, be noted in thy Book, for GOD has vi&s;ited thee with his Sal|vation.&mdash;On <HI>Monday</HI> midnight, as I was lying on my Bed, my Sleep departed from me, and I had no re&s;t in my Spirit, becau&s;e although the Weather was &s;o exceeding Calm, and we in &s;o great Di&s;tre&s;s, yet no Boat was &s;ent to fetch us Provi&s;ions. Upon this I &s;poke to the Captain, and he to the Mate, who in the Morning went with a Boat, and about Noon this Day returned loaded with Provi&s;ions and Wa|ter, and not only &s;o, but told us, he was kindly in|treated by the People he met with, e&s;pecially by a great Country Gentleman, who came to his Seat at midnight, on purpo&s;e to relieve him and his Com|panions; furni&s;hed them with a fre&s;h Boat and other Nece&s;&s;aries, mo&s;t kindly invited me, though unknown, to his Hou&s;e, to &s;tay as long as I plea&s;ed; and has order'd Hor&s;es to wait ready to take me thither.</P>
<P>Who is &s;o great, &s;o good a GOD, as our GOD? Our Hour of Extremity was indeed come: For we had but half a Pint of Water left, and my Sto|mach

<P>A little before our Provi&s;ions came, I had been noting in my Diary, that I believed Deliverance was at Hand; for la&s;t Night and this Morning, I had the mo&s;t violent Conflict within my&s;elf that I have had at all. Thus GOD always prepares me for his Mercies. <HI>Oh that this may &s;trengthen my Faith, and make me willing to follow the Lamb where&s;oever he &s;hall be plea&s;ed to lead me, Amen,</HI> LORD JESUS, <HI>Amen!</HI></P>

Still greater Mercies GOD confers on his unwor|thy Servant. For after our Provi&s;ions were brought aboard, the Wind &s;till continued fair, and by &s;ix at Night blew us to a little Place on <HI>Karrigholt</HI> I&s;land, before which we ca&s;t Anchor. <HI>Prai&s;e the LORD, O my Soul, and all that is within me prai&s;e his Holy Name!</HI></P>
<P>Ever &s;ince I have been on Board the <HI>Mary,</HI> the&s;e Words, <Q>Howbeit we mu&s;t be ca&s;t upon a certain I&s;land</Q> (which were Part of the Le&s;&s;on I read la&s;t at <HI>Savannah</HI>) have been continually pre&s;s'd upon my Heart, &s;o that I have often mention'd it to one of my Companions. Behold they are now fulfilled. <HI>Oh how un&s;earchable are thy Doings, O LORD, and thy Ways pa&s;t finding out!</HI></P>
<P>Why GOD dealeth thus with me, I know not now, but I &s;hall know hereafter. However this I know, that this Voyage has been greatly for my Good.&mdash;For I have had a glorious Opportunity of &s;earching the Scriptures, compo&s;ing Di&s;cour&s;es, wri|ting Letters, and communing with my own Heart.&mdash;We have been on Board ju&s;t nine Weeks and three Days.&mdash;A long and perilous, but profitable Voyage to my Soul: For I hope it has learnt him, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, to endure Hard&s;hips as becometh a Mini|&s;ter of CHRIST. My Cloaths have not been off (except to change me) all the Pa&s;&s;age: Part of the Time I lay on open Deck, Part on a Che&s;t, and the Remainder on a Bed-&s;tead cover'd with my <HI>Buffa|loe'</HI>s Skin.

and little.&mdash;Many inward Trials al&s;o GOD has been plea&s;ed to &s;end me, which I believe, he has &s;anctifi|ed to my great Good. I am now going on Shore, to the Hou&s;e of a wealthy Gentleman, whom GOD has commanded to receive me. I may yet be expo|&s;ed to many Perils by Land e're I &s;ee my dear Friends. But his Grace who has pre&s;erved me from &s;o many Perils by Water, will al&s;o be &s;ufficient for me on dry Land. Whil&s;t I continue on this &s;ide Eterni|ty, I never expect to be free from Trials, only to change them. For it is nece&s;&s;ary to heal the Pride of my Heart, that &s;uch &s;hould come: With a par|ticular fear and trembling, I think of going to <HI>Lon|don.</HI> But he that pre&s;erved <HI>Daniel</HI> in the Den of Lions, and the three Children in the fiery Furnace, will, I hope, pre&s;erve me from the fiery Trial of Popularity, and from the mi&s;guided Zeal of tho&s;e, who without Cau&s;e, are my Enemies&punc; <HI>Father, in|to thy Hands I commend my Spirit. Magnify &s;till thy free Grace in me. Guide me by thy unerring Wi&s;dom, receive, O receive me for thy infinite Mercies &s;ake, in</HI> CHRIST JESUS, <HI>into Glory hereafter!</HI></P>
<P>As for the Succe&s;s of my Mini&s;try, whil&s;t on Board, I &s;hall only &s;ay, That I hope much Sin has been prevented, and one I hope effectually conver|ted, who is to be my Fellow Traveller to <HI>England.

<P>It is ob&s;ervable that ju&s;t as we had ca&s;t Anchor, a violent Wind ro&s;e, which (had it happen'd &s;ooner) mu&s;t have greatly hurt us. <HI>Marvellous are thy Works,</HI> O LORD, <HI>and that my Soul knoweth right well!</HI></P>

<P>As I &s;topped to have my Hor&s;es &s;hoe'd I went into one of the Poor Peoples Cabins, as they call them; but it may as well be called a Stye, a Barn, or a Poultry Coop.
