<BIBL>LUKE XXII. 25.</BIBL>
<Q>And he &s;aid unto them, The kings of the Gentiles exerci&s;e lord&s;hip over them, and they that exerci&s;e authority upon them, are called Benefactors.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_THE high and &s;olemn Occa&s;ion of the <HI>Day</HI> will not allow me to take up the time in looking back into the preceeding <HI>Context;</HI> I &s;hall therefore only ju&s;t hint at the <HI>Occa&s;ion</HI> of the words I have now read unto you, and then con&s;ider <HI>the words</HI> them&s;elves.</P>
<P>As to the occa&s;ion of them, it was an unhappy <HI>Contention</HI> among the Di&s;ciples of CHRIST about <HI>Primary</HI> and Superiority, in the Ver&s;e which imme|diately
<PB N="2" REF="002340_0005_0FDB2C288D33D260">
preceeds the Text, <HI>there was al&s;o a &s;trife among them, which of them &s;hould be accounted the greate&s;t.</HI> Contention is the fruit of pride and ambition. Men that have a mind to be uppermo&s;t in the World can't be quiet, unle&s;s they are gra|tified in it. But all the Di&s;ciples of CHRIST were not guilty of this un&s;ea&s;onable affectation; the two Sons of <HI>Zebedee</HI> it &s;eems were the chief in this bu&s;ine&s;s. Its well the other of CHRIST's Di&s;|ciples had more wi&s;dom, and more grace, than to make &s;o much trouble about &s;ecular honor and pro|motion.</P>
<P>IT becomes the Di&s;ciples of CHRIST to be <HI>humble,</HI> and to watch again&s;t ambition. The meek and the admirable <HI>JESUS</HI> to quiet the Spirits of the&s;e a&s;piring Di&s;ciples tells them, that Tem|poral Lord&s;hip and Dominion did not belong to them, that he had &s;uperior honors to be&s;tow upon them, after they had &s;erved him a while here in the world, and that if they would have a little patience, he would promote them unto great honor, and make them <HI>Sit upon thrones judging the tribes of I&s;rael.</HI></P>
<P>THEIR bu&s;ine&s;s at pre&s;ent was not to be mini|&s;tred unto, but to mini&s;ter; and it was a vanity in them to dream of Temporal Promotion, for <HI>his kingdom was not of this world&punc;</HI> The high and dig|nified Titles of <HI>Archontes</HI> and <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="3 letters">le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s</HI> did not belong to them, but only tho&s;e of <HI>Doul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">i,</HI> and <HI>Dia|cona<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">.</HI> Temporal Power and Juri&s;diction belongs to the Princes of the Gentiles, and not unto the Mini&s;ters of CHRIST. <HI>The Kings of the Gentiles exerci&s;e Lord&s;hip over them, and they that exerci&s;e</HI>

<HI>authority upon them are called Benefactors.</HI> And &s;o we are come to the Words them&s;elves; and in them we may ob&s;erve.</P>
<P N="1">1. THE Power that <HI>Sovereign Princes</HI> are In|ve&s;ted with, it is a Power of <HI>Lord&s;hip</HI> and Domi|nion. <HI>The Kings of the Gentiles exerci&s;e Lord&s;hip.</HI> They do it <HI>defacto,</HI> and they do it <HI>de jure.</HI> The &s;upream Dominion is the LORD's; but there is a delegated Dominion and Power ve&s;ted in the Sons of Men. GOD is the Sovereign LORD; but the Princes and Kings of the Earth are his Lieutenants, his Deputies and Vicegerents, and have a lawfull right to exerci&s;e Dominion.</P>
<P N="2">2. THE <HI>Ends</HI> to which they ought to exerci&s;e their Authority; to the good, the benefit, the ad|vantage of tho&s;e who are under their Authority. This is the great End of all Rule and Government; and the be&s;t Ends of Government are prevented, when they that have the Dominion tyrannize over the People, and exerci&s;e their Authority in a Lordly and Domineering manner; this Power is given <HI>for Edification and not for De&s;truction.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. THE honorable <HI>Appellation</HI> that belongs to them when they exerci&s;e their Authority regularly, and &s;uitably to the original de&s;ign and in&s;titution of Government: <HI>They are called Benefactors</HI>&punc; And very properly called &s;o, according to the notation of the Word; becau&s;e <HI>they do good</HI> in their places, make a proper Improvement of their Powers, and are <HI>Publick Ble&s;&s;ings</HI> to the World.</P>
<P>THE Greek Word <HI>Kalountai,</HI> is often u&s;ed for <HI>E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">i,</HI> they <HI>are</HI> Benefactors, and &s;hall be <HI>called,</HI> ac|counted, e&s;teemed, and highly honored as &s;uch to

the Kingdoms and Countries under their au&s;picious Government.</P>
<P>THE Kings of the Gentiles&punc; were fond of a&s;&s;u|ming magnificent <HI>Titles</HI> unto them&s;elves, and &s;ometimes the good they did to the Publick, ju&s;tly merited &s;ome memorable Appellation. So one of the <HI>AEgyptian Ptolomies</HI> had the name of <HI>Euer|get<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">es,</HI> and if <HI>Tertull<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s</HI> the Orator might be be|lieved, <HI>Felix</HI> the Roman Governour for the Pro|vince of <HI>Judea</HI> was a happy Ruler, and might well be called a Benefactor; for this is the Encomium given of him. Acts 24. 2. <HI>Seeing that by thee we enjoy great quietne&s;s, and that very worthy deeds are done unto this nation by thy providence,</HI> &amp;c. This was an Excellent commendation of <HI>Felix,</HI> his Go|vernment, if it had been <HI>true</HI> and &s;poken without flattery. But <HI>Tacitus</HI> &s;ays of <HI>Felix</HI> that he was <HI>Inexplebilis Gurges</HI> an In&s;atiable Gulph of Cove|tou&s;ne&s;s. The <HI>Jewi&s;h Hi&s;torian</HI> &s;peaks of his Incon|tinency, and the <HI>Sacred Story</HI> gives us rea&s;on end to think that he was Intemperate and Unju&s;t; or el&s;e he would not have trembled as he did, when the <HI>Apo&s;tle rea&s;oned before him of righteou&s;ne&s;s, and of temperance, and of the Judgment to come,</HI> And a Man of &s;o much Corruption, could never make a good Governour. The Pretended Succe&s;&s;ors of <HI>Peter</HI> have al&s;o a&s;&s;umed the venerable names of <HI>Pius,</HI> &amp; <HI>Clement,</HI> &amp; <HI>Innocent,</HI> &amp; <HI>Boniface;</HI> as if they excell'd other Men in Piety, Clemency, Innocency and good works; but the World knows how poorly they have an&s;wered the&s;e honorary Titles.</P>
<P>BUT this is the honorable <HI>Appellation</HI> which belongs unto the <HI>Princes</HI> of the Earth when the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="5" REF="002340_0008_0FDB2C2FF6B186A0">
Exerci&s;e their Authority unto the be&s;t good of the People: <HI>They are Benefactors:</HI> 'Tis their <HI>D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ty</HI> to be &s;uch, and when they are &s;uch it is their <HI>Glory</HI> and their Excellency. Accordingly the Doctrine may be,</P>
<P><LABEL>DOCTRINE.</LABEL>
<HI>THAT it is the Duty and Excellency of tho&s;e that are in Authority to be Benefactors.</HI> So to <HI>Im|prove</HI> the Power &amp; Authority given them from Above, that they may de&s;erve to be &s;o <HI>called.</HI></P>
<P>THERE are two <HI>Propo&s;itions</HI> I would &s;peak to under this Doctrine.</P>
<P>PROP. I. <HI>THAT the Divine Providence does call &s;ome to Exerci&s;e Authority over Others.</HI> And here we may con&s;ider,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>THAT the Supream Dominion is the LORDS. Dominion and fear are with Him. His is the Kingdom, the Power, and the Glory for ever, Amen.</HI></P>
<P>HIS Authority is the mo&s;t Sovereign, Ab&s;o|lute and Supream. He is <HI>Higher than the Kings of the Earth;</HI> He hath <HI>a Name above every Name.</HI> All humane Power is <HI>Derivative,</HI> but His is an <HI>Original,</HI> Ab&s;olute, Eternal, &amp; Independent Power; He is the <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed and Only Potentate;</HI> He is the <HI>King Eternal,</HI> Immortal, Invi&s;ible, the only Wi&s;e GOD, to whom belongs the Dominion, and the Power for ever.</P>
<P>AND His Dominion is the mo&s;t <HI>Exten&s;ive.</HI> As He is the <HI>Everla&s;ting GOD the LORD, the
<PB N="6" REF="002340_0009_0FDB2C3463585AE8">
Creator of all the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> of the Earth;</HI> So He is the <HI>Governour&punc; among the nations,</HI> and all Creatures <HI>in all places of his dominion</HI> are under His Rule &amp; Gubernation.</P>
<P>THE Princes of the Earth had their <HI>Proprietary</HI> Governments <HI>The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ead of Syria is Dama&s;cus, and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ead of Dama&s;cus is Rezin,</HI> i. e. <HI>Dama&s;cus</HI> is the Capital City of <HI>Syria,</HI> and <HI>Rezin</HI> is King thereof. <HI>The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ead of Ephraim is Samaria; and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ead of Samaria is Remah<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">'s &s;on,</HI> I&s;a. 7. 8. But GOD is the Head and King over all the Countries and Kingdoms of the World; their Powers are li|mited &amp; confined unto their own narrow Di&s;tricts and Territories; but GOD is a univer&s;al King; <HI>He ruleth by his power for ever, his eyes behold the nations,</HI> P&s;al. 66. 7. He hath e&s;tabli&s;hed his throne in the Heaven, <HI>and his kingdom ruleth over all;</HI> There the <HI>Antient of days</HI> does &s;it, and is waited upon with State and Magnificence, the glorious Angels are His royal Attendance, and there is an Innumerable Company of them. <HI>The Chariots of God are twenty thou&s;and, even thou&s;ands of Angels, God is in the mid&s;t of them, as in Sinai, in his holy place.</HI></P>
<P>AND as the Supream and Sovereign LORD, He gives <HI>Laws</HI> unto the whole Creation; He orders all the times and the changes that go over the Kingdoms, and the Countries; and in all His Ad|mini&s;trations He is <HI>excellent in Power, and in Judgment, and in Plenty of Ju&s;tice;</HI> and th&ocirc; His Judgments are a great deep, and we cannot know them by rea&s;on of darkne&s;s; yet we &s;hould always reverence and adore the rectitude of His governing
<PB N="7" REF="002340_0010_0FDB2C36CF73A488">
Providence, and be ready to pay that ju&s;t acknow|ledgement unto GOD, P&s;al. 97. 2. <HI>Though clouds and darkne&s;s are round about him, yet Righteou&s;|ne&s;s and Judgment are the habitation of his throne.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>THE Divine Providence calls &s;ome from among men, to exerci&s;e Authority over others.</HI> The Wi&s;dom of GOD has E&s;tabli&s;hed a Government in the World, and ordained that there &s;hould be a rule over Men; and the World without it would no more be a <HI>Co&s;mos</HI> but a <HI>Chaos.</HI> When <HI>Lycurgus</HI> was Importuned by one to e&s;tabli&s;h a popular Parity in the State, Do thou &s;ays he, fir&s;t begin it in thy own Family. Civil Government is of Divine In|&s;titution; and the In&s;titution is &s;o nece&s;&s;ary that human Societies cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t without it. There is a Rule even in the Kingdom of Darkne&s;s, and a Prince of the Power of the Air. The light of Na|ture led the Nations to practi&s;e upon this Princi|ple: the Gentiles had their Kings. But the Divine Providence over-rules; and GOD that Governs the World puts the Scepter into their hands. Hence the Prophet <HI>Daniel</HI> tells <HI>Bel&s;hezzar,</HI> Dan. 5. 18. <HI>The mo&s;t high God gave unto Nebuchadnezzar thy Father a Kingdom, and Maje&s;ty, &amp; Honour, &amp; Glory.</HI> Hence 'tis &s;aid, <HI>Prov.</HI> 8. 15. <HI>By me Kings reign. For me</HI> Kings reign, &s;o &s;ome read it; and if we &s;hould read it &s;o, it may teach the Kings of the Earth, that they ought to rule for GOD, and im|prove their Authority to His Glory. Some read it, <HI>In me,</HI> that is, in the Exalting &amp; Honouring of me they &s;hall reign pro&s;perou&s;ly: If they honour me, I will honour them, if they exalt <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, I will

E&s;tabli&s;h them. The be&s;t way for Kings, and their Kingdoms to flouri&s;h is to &s;erve the LORD.</P>
<P>BUT we read it, <HI>By me,</HI> that is, not meerly by Divine Permi&s;&s;ion, but by Divine <HI>Ordination,</HI> and Appointment: Whether Kingdoms be Hereditary, or Elective, yet the <HI>Powers that be, are ordained of GOD.</HI> The Eternal King has an uncontroulable right to give the Kingdoms of Men unto whom&s;o|ever He will; and &s;ometimes He &s;ets over them the ba&s;e&s;t of Men, to the intent that Men may know, that the Mo&s;t High does rule, that Dominion is not founded in Grace, and that the Gifts of Providence are di&s;pen&s;ed by a Sovereign hand. So &s;ometimes GOD <HI>lifteth up the poor out of the du&s;t, and rai&s;eth up the beggar from the dunghill, to &s;et them among princes, and to cau&s;e them to inherit the throne of glory; for the pillars of the Earth are the Lords, and he hath &s;et the world upon them,</HI> 1 Sam. 2. 8.</P>
<P>THIS may &s;uffice for the fir&s;t <HI>Propo&s;ition.</HI></P>
<P>PROP. II. <HI>THEY that exerci&s;e Authority over others &s;hould be Benefactors.</HI> They &s;hould exerci&s;e their Authority to the benefit of the People, that they may be worthy of that honorable Appella|tion.</P>
<P>AND here I &s;hall endeavour fir&s;t to &s;hew <HI>wherein</HI> they &s;hould be Benefactors, and then &s;hall con&s;ider their <HI>Obligation</HI> to be &s;uch.</P>
<P N="1">1. I &s;hall endeavour fir&s;t to &s;how <HI>wherein</HI> they &s;hould be Benefactors, and I will only mention <HI>four</HI> particulars.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="9" REF="002340_0012_0FDB2C39680BBD50">
(1.) <HI>BY making the be&s;t Laws for the benefit of the People.</HI> Good Laws are a benefit to a People. And <HI>wi&s;e Lawgivers are great Benefactors,</HI> and have been honored as &s;uch among the Nations. So was <HI>Solon, Lycurgus,</HI> and others. The making of Laws is one branch of the <HI>Power</HI> committed unto Rulers; and the making of good Laws will be one princi|pal In&s;tance of their <HI>Wi&s;dom,</HI> their <HI>Integrity,</HI> and their <HI>Publick Care</HI> for their People.</P>
<P><HI>LAWS</HI> for the defending them in their Com|mon Rights as Men, and Religious Rights as Chri|&s;tians: Laws for the direction of the Mini&s;ters of Ju&s;tice; that they may know how to mini&s;ter Ju&s;|tice and Judgment unto all I&s;rael: Laws for the detecting and puni&s;hing Fraud, Forgery, Perjury, and every bold Iniquity: The mo&s;t effectual Laws po&s;&s;ible, for the &s;uppre&s;&s;ing Prophane&s;s, Intempe|rance &amp; every Immorality; and <HI>Sumptuary</HI> Laws as their Wi&s;dom &s;hall think fit for the governing the Expences of a People, the Retrenching the overgrown and in&s;upportable Exce&s;&s;es and Extra|vagancies; and Encouraging Thriftine&s;s and Fru|gality. The <HI>Romans</HI> made Laws to moderate the Exce&s;&s;es of Diet and Apparel.</P>
<P>BUT then it &s;hould be minded, that 'tis <HI>Exe|cution</HI> that gives life and force to Laws, and makes them quick and powerfull, and without this <HI>the &s;ons of Zeruia<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"></HI> will put forth their heads. The Lu&s;ts of Men are very unruly things, and they that are under the dominion of them will run unto all Ex|ce&s;s of Riot&punc; The&s;e raging waves of the Sea will be foaming out their own &s;hame, the&s;e Sons of Vio|lence will not be re&s;trained, unle&s;s the Civil Ma|gi&s;trate
<PB N="10" REF="002340_0013_0FDB2C3D6B4E45F0">
un&s;heath the Sword of Ju&s;tice, and &s;mite thr&ocirc; the Loins of them that work Iniquity.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) <HI>BY Employing the be&s;t of Men in the Admini|&s;tration.</HI> I know every good Man is not qualified for Rule. There are Gifts for Government, that are di&s;tinct from the Gifts of Sanctification&punc; yet the People will rejoyce when the Righteous are in Authority. If Rulers are &s;trangers to GOD, to CHRIST, to Virtue, to Religion, and they that work wickedne&s;s are &s;et up, and Men of the mo&s;t Loyal and Religious Principles, thr&ocirc; unrea&s;onable prejudices laid a&s;ide, it can't be for the Honor of GOD, for the Intere&s;t of a People, nor for the glory of the Government. When <HI>Solomon</HI> &s;aw <HI>folly &s;et in great dignity,</HI> he &s;ays it was <HI>an Error:</HI> Eccl. 10. 5. The mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hing honors are certainly due to Men of Merit, to &s;uch as have di&s;tingui&s;h'd them&s;elves by their Virtue, their Loyalty, their Fidelity; by their noble and generous Service for the Publick; their good deeds &s;hould not be for|gotten, their names ought to be in everla&s;ting re|membrance. The Laws of Honour, of Ju&s;tice, and of Gratitude oblige hereunto. The <HI>Roman</HI> great|ne&s;s was much owing to their Honor and Ju&s;tice herein&punc; And the <HI>Per&s;ian Monarchs</HI> kept a Regi&s;ter Book of the Names of the Benefactors, that Honor might be done them accordingly, <HI>E&s;th.</HI> 6. And he that deprives Men of the honor due to Virtue, de|prives them of Virtue it &s;elf, &s;ays <HI>Cato.</HI> And on the other hand, when Per&s;ons have rendred them|&s;elves unworthy of the Publick Tru&s;t, by their meane&s;s, their mercinarine&s;s, their ba&s;ene&s;s&punc; by
<PB N="11" REF="002340_0014_0FDB2C3EC50412A8">
their loo&s;e principles, and their corrupt and cove|tous practices; they &s;hould not have the Publick Countenance; they &s;hould have no Opportunity put into their hands to go off with the &s;poil of their oppre&s;&s;ed Neighbours; they will <HI>tran&s;gre&s;s for a piece of bread.</HI> They &s;hould therefore <HI>break the Jaws of the wicked, and pluck the &s;poil out of their teeth.</HI></P>
<P N="3">(3.) <HI>BY &s;etting the be&s;t Examples before the People.</HI> Good Examples may do a great deal of Good. The Examples of Rulers will be likely to have a great deal of Influence, when they are Men of Virtue, Probity and Goodne&s;s, and excell therein. Their bright and &s;hining Examples will enlighten &amp; influence others. But when Rulers are the <HI>Rulers of Sodom,</HI> the People will be the <HI>People of Gomorrah. If a Ruler hearken to lies, all his &s;ervants are wicked.</HI> They &s;hould not therefore indulge them&s;elves in any thing that is mean, &s;or|did, or di&s;honourable. Its pity that Men of Honor and Di&s;tinction in the World, &s;hould bring a &s;tain upon all their Glory by a &s;ordid Indulgence unto any ba&s;e Lu&s;t, or tarni&s;h the brightne&s;s of their Cha|racter with &s;ome &s;uch Exception as that, or one a great deal wor&s;e than that, 2 <HI>Kings</HI> 5. 1.</P>
<P N="4">(4.) <HI>BY doing what they can to e&s;tabli&s;h and pro|mote the true Religion.</HI> Religion is the <HI>Life</HI> of a People, and by taking care of that we &s;hall <HI>prolong our days in the land,</HI> which the LORD GOD gave unto our Fathers.</P>
<P>IT is the <HI>Strength</HI> of a People, and by taking care of that, Rulers will be the Strength, and the <HI>Stability of our times.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="002340_0015_0FDB2C40CE29E678">

<P>IT is the <HI>Glory</HI> of a People, and it will make us <HI>high in name, and in prai&s;e, and in honour above all people. Righteou&s;ne&s;s exalteth a nation, but &s;in is a reproach unto any people.</HI></P>
<P>RELIGION has both a <HI>natural</HI> and <HI>moral</HI> ten|dency to promote the Pro&s;perity of a People: if Religion flouri&s;hes the Country will flouri&s;h; and we &s;hall pro&s;per whither&s;oever we turn our &s;elves. Our <HI>Merchandize</HI> will flouri&s;h, and that will be a benefit to the Country; our <HI>Fi&s;hery</HI> will flouri&s;h and that will be an advantage; our <HI>Husbandry</HI> will flouri&s;h, and that will be a benefit, <HI>for the King him&s;elf, is &s;erved by the field:</HI> then &s;hall <HI>Zebulun rejoice in his goings forth, and I&s;&s;achar in his tent.</HI></P>
<P>RELIGION tends to <HI>prevent and divert Divine Judgments;</HI> and the Judgments of GOD are wa&s;ting and breaking things; they make a Land mourn, they cau&s;e the <HI>glory of Jacob to wax thin, and the fulne&s;s of his fle&s;h to wax lean.</HI></P>
<P>RELIGION tends to <HI>&s;ecure the Divine Pre&s;ence</HI> and Ble&s;&s;ing; and the Pre&s;ence of GOD with a People, is the making of a People; if GOD leave them they can't be happy, if GOD be with them they can't be mi&s;erable. <HI>The Lord his God is with him&punc; and the &s;hout of a king is in the mid&s;t of them; he hath as it were the &s;trength of a Unicorn,</HI> Numb. 23. 21.

<PB N="13" REF="002340_0016_0FDB2C44DE19A0A0">
Power of godline&s;s among a People, GOD will not leave them, nor for&s;ake them. So that our Religion is the foundation of all our hopes &amp; expectations. This is the be&s;t foundation we can build our hopes upon, both as to the pre&s;ent and future Generation; as long as this &s;hall continue in its glory, and in|crea&s;e, we may humbly hope for the ble&s;&s;ing of Heaven even upon our late&s;t Po&s;terity: for the Mercy of the LORD <HI>is from everla&s;ting to everla&s;t|ing upon them that fear him,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>2. LET us con&s;ider the <HI>Obligations</HI> on Rulers to be <HI>Benefactors.</HI></P>
<P N="1">(1.) <HI>THEY are Ordained of GOD for this very End.</HI> Rom. 13. 4. That they may be <HI>Mini|&s;ters of GOD for good;</HI> In&s;truments in the hands of Divine Providence to the weal &amp; pro&s;perity of a People. This is the End of their betru&s;tment, they &s;hould therefore lay out them&s;elves for the good of the People; defend their rights &amp; liberties, and protect them in all their valuable Priviledges, and when they do &s;o, they are the light &amp; life of a People. They are <HI>as the light of the Morning, when the Sun ari&s;eth, even a Morning without clouds,</HI> 2 Sam. 23. 4. They are <HI>the breath of our No&s;trils,</HI> the <HI>anointed of the Lord; of whom we &s;aid, We &s;hall live under their &s;hadow among the beathen.</HI></P>
<P>BUT when Rulers forget their duty, and abu&s;e their Power; when they neglect their care, their People and their charge; grow Imperious and Ty|rannical, lord it over GOD's Heritage, and are like <HI>the kine of Ba&s;han in the mountains of Samaria, that oppre&s;s the poor &amp; cru&s;h the needy, and &s;ay to their ma&s;ter bring and let us drink;</HI> they are &s;o far from
<PB N="14" REF="002340_0017_0FDB2C46E4DE4350">
an&s;wering the Ends of Government, and from be|ing <HI>Benefactors,</HI> that they are the greate&s;t <HI>Burdens</HI> unto Mankind, and the greate&s;t <HI>Plagues</HI> and pun|i&s;hments to the World. <HI>As a roaring Lion and a ranging Bear, &s;o is a wicked ruler among the Peo|ple,</HI> Prov. 28. 15.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) <HI>THE Publick Support is another Obligati|tion upon them. For this very cau&s;e do we pay tribute,</HI> &s;ayes the Apo&s;tle, <HI>Becau&s;e they are Gods Mini&s;ters attending continually upon this very thing,</HI> Rom. 13. 6. The <HI>bread of the Governour</HI> is given that they might Imploy their Time, their Talents, and Powers in the Service of the Publick. Rea&s;on and Con&s;cience obliges the People to &s;upport them if they do attend upon it. And the <HI>Lord JESUS CHRIST</HI> has laid this duty upon the People to|wards their Rulers, in the &s;ame Commandment with the duty they owe to GOD. Math. 22. 21. <HI>Render therefore unto Cae&s;ar the things that are Cae|&s;ars, and unto God the things that are Gods.</HI> And therefore as we &s;hould be ready to render <HI>tribute to whom tribute is due, cu&s;tom to whom cu&s;tom, fear to whom fear, and honour to whom honour</HI> is due; &s;o they that receive it are verily <HI>debtors unto us,</HI> to do us all the good they can.</P>
<P N="3">(3.) <HI>THE &s;pecial Tru&s;t &amp; Confidence repo&s;ed in them is a further Obligation upon them.</HI> The <HI>King</HI> as Supream is put in tru&s;t by GOD to be a <HI>Nur&s;ing Father</HI> to His People: and <HI>Governours,</HI> and &s;uch as are &s;ent abroad by him, into the <HI>Kings Provinces,</HI> are Intru&s;ted by their <HI>Royal Ma&s;ter,</HI> and He has a Confidence in them that they will Exerci&s;e their Authority to the be&s;t advantage of the <HI>Provinces.</HI>
<PB N="15" REF="002340_0018_0FDB2C4853B62C50">
But if they &s;hould &s;eek not their welfare but their hurt, and <HI>damage ari&s;e to the King,</HI> or to His Sub|jects; They ba&s;ely betray their tru&s;t, are fal&s;e to GOD, and di&s;loyal to their Prince; are criminal and deeply guilty, and forfeit the good Character in the <HI>Text.</HI> Yea, they are under the <HI>Oath</HI> of GOD, and that adds weight &amp; &s;olemnity to the tru&s;t; and they can't neglect their duty herein without the deepe&s;t Perjury and Guilt: The tye is Sacred and Deep to manage this great betru&s;tment faithfully, and to them may be directed the words of the wi&s;e Man, <HI>I coun&s;el thee to keep the Kings Command|ment, becau&s;e of the Oath of God.</HI></P>
<P N="4">(4.) <HI>THE Sacred Rules given by the Holy Gho&s;t, to direct their Admini&s;trations, are a &s;trong Obligation upon them.</HI> They have indeed the Statutes of the <HI>Kingdom</HI> for their direction: but yet they &s;hould make the Statutes of <HI>GOD</HI> the Man of their coun|cel; they &s;hould have a <HI>Copy</HI> of the&s;e alwayes be|fore them, <HI>and &s;hould read therein all the dayes of their lives;</HI> and they &s;hall do well if they take heed unto them: They can't be good Rulers, if they have no regard to the Rules of Righteou&s;ne&s;s and of Ju&s;tice; if they turn a&s;ide after Lucre and take Bribes, and corrupt Judgment, they forget what the Spirit of the LORD &s;aid unto <HI>David,</HI> 2 Sam. 23. 2. <HI>The God of I&s;rael &s;aid, the Rock of I&s;rael &s;pake unto me; he that ruleth over men mu&s;t be ju&s;t, ruling in the fear of the Lord.</HI></P>
<P N="5">(5.) <HI>THE honourable Titles</HI> given to Rulers, teaches them they &s;hould be <HI>Benefactors.</HI></P>
<P>I have &s;aid, <HI>ye are gods,</HI> and GOD is the great Benefactor: they are the <HI>Anointed Cher<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">,</HI>

<P>THEY are <HI>heirs of re&s;traint,</HI> according to the Marginal Note in <HI>Judg.</HI> 18. 7. and &s;hould put a check to the growing Sins of the times, by puni&s;h|ing Intemperance, Exce&s;&s;es and Iniquities of the places where they Rule.
