<BIBL>1 Epi&s;tle of PETER, CHAP. v. VERSE 6.</BIBL>
<Q>Humble your&s;elves therefore, under the mighty hand of <HI>GOD,</HI> that he may exalt you in due time.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>WITHOUT &s;taying to con&s;ider the&s;e words in their primary reference, as pointed out in the context, I &s;hall proceed to di&s;cour&s;e upon them, agreable to the occa&s;ion of the pre&s;ent day, as I apprehend they will furni&s;h &s;uitable matter therefor.</P>
<P>GOD that created the univer&s;e, has &s;et him|&s;elf at the head of it, and undertaken to manage and controul it, as &s;eemeth good in his &s;ight. Univer&s;al empire and dominion of right belongs to him, and to none other: Nor is any other being at all equal to it, for the power of all other beings is finite, but the power of God is infinite, and &s;uch a power is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary in order to univer&s;al government. This is a doc|trine, which rea&s;on alone clearly dictates, and it is abundantly held forth in the &s;acred in&s;pired writings.</P>
<P>As to this lower world, the divine maje&s;ty is to be con&s;idered as the prime efficient in all events that take place. What ever may be &s;aid
<PB N="6" REF="013388_0005_0F90EE5AAFDFC490">
of the unde&s;ireable operation of the lu&s;ts and corruptions of men, their pride, malice, envy, avarice, &amp;c. as productive of uncomfortable events; what ever may be &s;aid of in&s;trumental and &s;econdary cau&s;es, yet the mighty hand of God is fir&s;tly to be eyed and acknowledged. It is a clear dictate of rea&s;on and &s;cripture that no|thing happens, particularly in this lower world, to individuals, or to &s;ocieties, greater or le&s;s; but it is by God's permi&s;&s;ion and providence, and the events that take place, are very various. And con&s;idering the moral obligations that man|kind are under to God, it certainly becomes them to conduct towards him agreable to tho&s;e di&s;pen|&s;ations that he vi&s;its them with.</P>
<P>THE words of our text, leads us to the con|&s;ideration of an important duty under calamitous events.&mdash;<HI>Humble your&s;elves &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>THEY lead us al&s;o to a con&s;ideration of the happy effect, and con&s;equence of complying with this duty&mdash;<HI>That he may exalt</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>FIRST, We may con&s;ider the duty here en|joined under calamitous events. <HI>Humble</HI> &amp;c. This phra&s;e here. <HI>The mighty hand of God,</HI> under which men are called to <HI>humble them&s;elves</HI> is ex|pre&s;&s;ive of di&s;pen&s;ations and events, in divine providence, that are di&s;tre&s;&s;ing, grievous and ca|lamitous. Sometimes indeed it is expre&s;&s;ive of Gods favourable di&s;pen&s;ations, as when Mo&s;es tells the people of I&s;rael, that the Lord their God brought them out of Egypt, <HI>through a mighty hand,</HI> and, <HI>by a &s;tretched out arm.</HI> Deut. iv. 34. God kindly interpo&s;ed for them, and di&s;played his
<PB N="7" REF="013388_0006_0F90F4A66ED188E0">
almighty power for their deliverance. And &s;o other places might be mentioned: But here in our text, as I ju&s;t &s;aid, <HI>the mighty hand of God,</HI> is expre&s;&s;ive of calamitous events. Otherwi&s;e there would be no propriety in the apo&s;tles ex|hortation, for men to <HI>humble them&s;elves</HI> under it. Favourable di&s;pen&s;ations of God, call rather for gladne&s;s and rejoicing before him, than humi|liation.</P>
<P>I would therefore go on and &s;ay, that the great governor of the world is various in his di&s;pen&s;ations, not only towards individuals, but towards communities. At times many great and public ble&s;&s;ings are enjoyed, the &s;ame in kind which Mo&s;es &s;peaks of to I&s;rael, and encourages them to expect from the good providence of God, if they approved them&s;elves an obedi|ent people. <HI>Deut.</HI> xxviii, 3d. &amp;c. <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed &s;halt thou be in the city, and ble&s;&s;ed &s;halt thou be in the field. Ble&s;&s;ed &s;hall be the fruit of thy body, and the fruit of thy ground, and the fruit of thy cattle, the increa&s;e of thy kine and the flocks of thy &s;heep. Ble&s;&s;ed &s;hall be thy ba&s;ket and thy &s;tore &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>BUT tho' they are &s;ometimes made to rejoice under the &s;miles of divine providence, yet by and by the &s;cene is changed: Their &s;ituation and circum&s;tances are quite the rever&s;e. Wars, famines, pe&s;tilences &s;ucceed, or come in the room of peace health and plenty. And great fears, di&s;tre&s;&s;es and perplexities nece&s;&s;arily attend &s;uch calamitous events. And &s;ometimes after long enjoyment of civil and religious liberties and privileges, a people are bro't into great embara&s;s|ments
<PB N="8" REF="013388_0007_0F90F4A7B88C3A10">
and di&s;tre&s;&s;es. And their public affairs, their civil and &s;acred privileges, their trade and bu&s;ine&s;s and occupations, wear a dark and gloomy a&s;pect, &s;o that they know not what to do, or how to extricate them&s;elves. Such are the changes and alterations that are made in kingdoms, nations and provinces, in the cour&s;e of Gods providen|tial government. And in the language of our text, in all this is <HI>the mighty hand of God.</HI> His powerful hand it is that brings on the&s;e di&s;tre&s;&s;es and calamities. Thus as it is in the book of <HI>Job.</HI> xii. 23. <HI>He increa&s;eth the nations and de&s;troyeth them, he enlargeth the nations and &s;traiteneth them again.</HI> That of the prophet <HI>Jeremiah</HI> may be ap|plied here, chap. xxv. 30. &amp;c. <HI>The Lord &s;hall roar from on high, and utter his voice from his holy habitation, he &s;hall mightily roar upon his habita|tion, he &s;hall give a &s;hout as they that tread the grapes again&s;t all the inhabitants of the earth. A noi&s;e &s;hall come even to the ends of the earth; for the Lord hath a controver&s;y with the nations</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>In a word here. All good and evil, public as well as per&s;onal, is principally to be attributed to the governing providence of God mo&s;t high, who performeth all things. This is the doctrine of the bible. <HI>I form the light,</HI> &s;ays God, <HI>and create darkne&s;s, I make peace and create evil, I the Lord do all the&s;e things.</HI> I&s;ai. xlv. 7.</P>
<P>AND in all public di&s;tre&s;&s;es and calamities, it is evident the Lord hath a controver&s;y with that people among whom they happen. This is ex|pre&s;&s;ed in the pa&s;&s;age I ju&s;t mentioned from the prophet <HI>Jeremiah.</HI> So al&s;o is it in that of the pro|phet <HI>Ho&s;ea,</HI> and the ground of his controver&s;y is
<PB N="9" REF="013388_0008_0F90F4A82F6E3640">
therein mentioned, <HI>Ho&s;ea</HI> chap. 4. from the be|ginning, <HI>Hear the word of the Lord, ye children of I&s;rael, for the Lord hath a controver&s;y with the inhabitants of the land, becau&s;e there is no truth nor mercy, nor knowledge of God in the land. By &s;wearing and lying and killing and &s;tealing and committing adultery, they break out, and blood toucheth blood.</HI></P>
<P>Now when the &s;cripture &s;peaks of God's hav|ing a controver&s;y with a people; it naturally &s;up|po&s;es that he is di&s;plea&s;ed and angry with them. A controver&s;y between man and man, &s;uppo&s;es that they are at odds with each other, that there is &s;ome ground or cau&s;e of unea&s;ine&s;s and di&s;plea|&s;ure, and hence they are wont to take methods to decide it, each aiming to make his part good, or to gain the a&s;cendancy, that &s;o he may have it in his power to curb and cha&s;ti&s;e his antagoni&s;t. This is no ground for controver&s;y, when an en|tire harmony and good agreement &s;ub&s;i&s;ts. So that, as I ju&s;t &s;aid, God's having a controver&s;y with a people, &s;uppo&s;es his anger and di&s;plea|&s;ure again&s;t them. Accordingly when his mighty hand is lifted up, when he vi&s;its them with tho&s;e evils and calamities we have mentioned at this time, it is an undoubted evidence that he is wroth with them, calamities are &s;o many tokens of his anger. This is very frequently expre&s;&s;ed in &s;cripture. I &s;hall only mention that of the prophet, <HI>I&s;aiah</HI> chap. ix. 11, 12. <HI>Therefore the Lord &s;hall &s;et up the adver&s;aries of Rezin again&s;t him, and join his enemies together. The</HI> Syrians <HI>before, and the</HI> Phili&s;tines <HI>behind, and they &s;hall devour I&s;rael
<PB N="10" REF="013388_0009_0F909502C92A92A8">
with open mouth. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is &s;tretched out &s;till.</HI></P>
<P>Now the que&s;tion is, what is it that excites the anger of God, and cau&s;es him to manife&s;t it in calamitous di&s;pen&s;ations? I an&s;wer in general it is on account of their wickedne&s;s and rebellion again&s;t him. If a people were univer&s;ally or very generally a virtuous, religious, obedient peo|ple, it is not to be tho't that the righteous and holy God, who loves goodne&s;s and righteou&s;ne&s;s, would have any controver&s;y with them, that he would bring any evils and calamities upon them, but would be their con&s;tant friend, guardian and protector. When therefore he contends with them and greatly di&s;tre&s;&s;es them, it mu&s;t be be|cau&s;e their iniquities and rebellions have provoked him to do &s;o. All this may be fairly argued not only from the holy &s;cripture, but from his cha|racter as the moral governor of the world. Mankind in all ages even unto the pre&s;ent, mu&s;t take to them&s;elves the blame of all the evils, di&s;tre&s;&s;es and calamities that have befallen them.</P>
<P>THEY mu&s;t do &s;o be&s;ure, if they don't confine their views to in&s;trumental and &s;econdary cau&s;es, but regard almighty God, as the great fir&s;t cau&s;e of all events. And no one who exerci&s;es a rational, &s;ober tho't, but mu&s;t be led thus to con&s;ider him. They mu&s;t be led to acknowledge his hand in all calamities, and to con&s;ider the moral ground or rea&s;on of them; namely, their di&s;obedience and rebellion again&s;t him.</P>
<P>AND in this view of things, ari&s;es the duty
<PB N="11" REF="013388_0010_0F90F4A99F704F30">
pointed out in our text, <ABBR><HI>viz.</HI></ABBR> to humble our&s;elves. <HI>Humble your&s;elves under the mighty hand of God.</HI></P>
<P>THIS may be con&s;idered as an exhortation to <HI>repentance</HI> when the di&s;pen&s;ations of the great governor of the world are di&s;tre&s;&s;ing and calami|tous. We find God uttering that complaint con|cerning the <HI>Jews,</HI> when his mighty hand <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">as lift|ed up again&s;t them, yea, when he let it fall heavily upon them, &amp; they were bro't into &s;ore di&s;tre&s;&s;es. <HI>Jer.</HI> viii. 5. <HI>Why then is this people of</HI> Jeru&s;alem <HI>&s;lidden back, by a perpetual back&s;liding, they hold fa&s;t deceit, they refu&s;e to return.</HI> It is plain he expected this from them; and he waited to &s;ee how it would be with them, whether <HI>they</HI> altered their conduct, that &s;o the way might be prepared for his altering <HI>his</HI> conduct towards them. Ac|cordingly it follows in the next ver&s;e, <HI>I hearkned and heard.</HI> I took a particular, critical notice how it was with them, <HI>but they &s;pake not aright, no man repented him of his wickedne&s;s, &s;aying, what have I done?</HI> What hand have I had in procuring the Lord's controver&s;y with this people, or in bringing on the&s;e evils and calamities? In|&s;tead of this they went on audaciou&s;ly and re&s;o|lutely in their iniquities and rebellions, as tho' they could carry the day again&s;t him, and be an over match for him. <HI>Every one turned to his cour&s;e, as the hor&s;e ru&s;heth into the battle.</HI></P>
<P>Was this to comply with God's expectations concerning them? No verily, but quite the rever&s;e. From the pa&s;&s;age I ju&s;t mentioned, it is plain that he expected that they would repent of all tho&s;e evils and tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions which had pro|cured his frowns.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="013388_0011_0F90F4AA2E15B6D8">
REPENTANCE don't con&s;i&s;t merely in any external rites &amp; ob&s;ervances.

This is &s;et forth in very &s;trong colours, in the 1<HI>&s;t.</HI> chap. <HI>I&s;aiah.</HI> We therein find the holy God who was perfectly acquainted with all their henious immoralities, &s;harply and pungently expo&s;tulating with them, for their laying &s;o much &s;tre&s;s upon external ritu|al ob&s;ervances, and &s;ufficiently expre&s;&s;ing the unavailablene&s;s of them to engage his favourable regards, while they went on in their iniquities. Yea, expre&s;&s;ing his great dete&s;tation and abhor|ence of them. It was in vain for them to think of &s;ub&s;tituting the&s;e in the room of real righteou&s;|ne&s;s goodne&s;s and virtue, 13<HI>th</HI> ver&s;e &amp;c. <HI>Bring no more vain oblations, incen&s;e is an abomination unto me, the new moons and &s;abbaths, the calling of a&s;&s;emblies I cannot away with, it is iniquity, even the &s;olemn meeting Your new moons and your appointed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">ea&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">s, my &s;oul hateth</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>AND then he goes on expre&s;&s;ly to telll them, what was the main and principal thing he looked at and what would be mo&s;t beneficial and ad|vantages them, ver&s;e 16, 17. <HI>Wa&s;h ye, make ye clean, put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes, cea&s;e to do evil, learn to do well, &s;eek judgment, relieve the oppre&s;&s;ed, judge the fatherle&s;s, plead for the widow.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="013388_0012_0F90950382312840">
THOSE things that go to con&s;titute true re|pentance, are here &s;et forth in general terms, ab&s;taining from every vice and immorality, and practi&s;ing tho&s;e things that are pious, virtuous, ju&s;t and righteous.</P>
<P>REPENTANCE however, I would ob&s;erve, is not to be con&s;idered, as con&s;i&s;ting merely in an external reformation of manners, there mu&s;t certainly in the fir&s;t place be an inward good di&s;po&s;ition. And indeed it is not likely that there will be an out|ward reformation of manners, in the want of &s;uch an inward good di&s;po&s;ition. It is not to be expected that there will be good fruit, unle&s;s the tree be good, to allude to our Saviours manner of expre&s;|&s;ion, <HI>Matth.</HI> chap. vii.</P>
<P>AND accordingly, the terms and phra&s;es made u&s;e of in &s;cripture to expre&s;s repentance, plainly &s;how that there is &s;omething more in it than what is external; that it con&s;i&s;ts al&s;o in that which is inward. Accordingly, it is &s;ometimes expre&s;&s;ed by <HI>a broken and contrite heart,</HI> by <HI>&s;orrowing</HI> and mourning, which is internal, &s;o al&s;o by men's <HI>humbling</HI> them&s;elves, as in our text.</P>
<P>WE have ob&s;erved that when the mighty hand of God is lifted up, or when di&s;tre&s;&s;ing calamitous events come upon a people, through the over|ruling providence of God, it is for the wickedne&s;s and rebellion of a people again&s;t his holy Maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>THE procuring cau&s;e, therefore, of &s;uch events is that which calls for repentance, and that from all orders, ranks and characters of per&s;ons. Public di&s;tre&s;&s;es and calamities are undoubtedly to be looked upon as tokens of the righteous anger of
<PB N="14" REF="013388_0013_0F9095044C52ADA8">
the Maje&s;ty of heaven: who is di&s;honoured, af|fronted and vilely and &s;hamefully treated by the impieties and wickedne&s;&s;es that are prevalent a|mong them. And this is rea&s;on &s;ufficient for univer&s;al mourning a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">d humiliation before God.</P>
<P>THE Maje&s;ty of heaven mo&s;t certainly de&s;erves other &s;ort of treatment than this. The excellen|cies of his nature demand the highe&s;t e&s;teem, veneration and &s;ubjection from his whole intelli|gent offspring. And &s;o does the paternal relation he &s;tands in to them. When his being and per|fections are &s;truck at, when he is in&s;ulted and abu&s;ed, as mo&s;t certainly is the ca&s;e, when many and heinous vices are ri&s;e in a community is it to be tho't &s;trange, that his anger is excited, and that he manife&s;ts it by inflicting &s;ore evils upon them, bringing on days of darkne&s;s perplexity and di&s;tre&s;s; e&s;pecially when for a long time he has exerci&s;ed his patience and forbearance towards them, and cau&s;ed them to &s;ee much good and outward pro&s;perity? Can it, I &s;ay, be tho't &s;trange that his offended maje&s;ty &s;hould lift up his hand again&s;t them and make them know feeling|ly, what an evil and bitter thing it is that they have departed from the Lord their God, and that his fear has not been with them?</P>
<P>Favourable di&s;pen&s;ations of his providence, not having had a kindly effect, their becoming a willing, obedient people, he &s;ees it fit to di&s;tre&s;s them in his anger&mdash;to lift up his mighty hand again&s;t them&mdash;to vi&s;it their tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions with the rod and their iniquities with &s;tripes. And yet &s;uch tokens of his anger are &s;ometimes di&s;regard|ed, and fail of producing proper effects.</P>

<P>How unju&s;t, how unrea&s;onable a conduct was this under the di&s;pen&s;ations of heaven?</P>
<P>MOST certainly it becomes a people to <HI>&s;ee,</HI> to take notice of the hand of God, when it is lifted up, to regard the work of the Lord, and the operation of his hand. And how are they to &s;ee and regard it? Why, by humbling them&s;elves, and learning and practi&s;ing righteou&s;ne&s;s. This is the end propo&s;ed by him, in lifting up his hand again&s;t them.

IT is certainly nece&s;&s;ary in this day of darkne&s;s, perplexity and di&s;tre&s;s, thro' the mighty hand of God lifted up again&s;t us, that there be great &s;earching of heart; a &s;erious and thorough en|into the grounds of God's controver&s;y with us; what have been the evils and abominations that have incen&s;ed the divine anger again&s;t us. This certainly is the main thing, and not merely look|ing at in&s;truments and &s;econd cau&s;es. For let the&s;e be what they will, yet (as was &s;aid before) God Almighty, is the fir&s;t cau&s;e, and ought to be regarded as &s;uch. It becomes us to be deeply humbled before him, for the many and heinous evils in the mid&s;t of us which have procured the tokens of his anger and di&s;plea&s;ure. We can't be properly humbled under divine rebukes, un|le&s;s we are humbled for the caur&s;e of them, the moral cau&s;e I mean. And to be thus humbled, nece&s;&s;arily &s;uppo&s;es that we have &s;ome ju&s;t and right &s;en&s;e of the badne&s;s the vilene&s;s, and un|rea&s;onablene&s;s of the cau&s;e; or in other words, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> we have a ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of the vilene&s;s and ma|lignity of &s;in or moral evil, as it is again&s;t God, as it counteracts his authority, as it is down-right rebellion again&s;t his crown and dignity, de&s;truc|tive of all regularity and order in the moral &s;y&s;|tem, naturally adapted to throw all things into confu&s;ion, to the di&s;honour of God, and thwart|ing the de&s;igns of all his grand operations in the kingdom of providence and of grace. To be humbled before God under his mighty hand, &s;uppo&s;es that we have a ju&s;t and thorough &s;en&s;e, of all this. And &s;o al&s;o the iniquity in all its

<P>AND in clo&s;e connexion with all this, and indeed as the natural re&s;ult of all, there will be firm and hearty re&s;olutions, through the divine aids, to abandon all tho&s;e vicious practices that have been habitually indulged: That they will no more indulge to prophanene&s;s, intemperance, unclean|ne&s;s, &s;tealing, making and propagating fal&s;e re|ports, wounding the character of their neighbours, over-reaching, defrauding, &s;abbath-breaking, di&s;|obedience to parents, de&s;pi&s;ing dignities, idling away their time to the neglecting their proper bu&s;ine&s;s, and making proper provi&s;ion for their families and dependants, needle&s;sly &s;pending their time and money in public hou&s;es.

<BIBL>1. Peter, v. 6.</BIBL>
<Q>We have con&s;idered <HI>the mighty hand of God,</HI> as intended of public di&s;tre&s;&s;es and calamitous events, brought on by his over-ruling provi|dence. Al&s;o the mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">al, procuring cau&s;e here|of, and the duty here exhorted to, <HI>Humble your&s;elves under the mighty hand of God.</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>I Go on now in the next place, to con&s;ider the probable happy con&s;equence of complying with this duty. <HI>Humble your&s;elves &amp;c. that he may exalt you in due time.</HI> To be <HI>exalted</HI> here, may intend obtaining deliverance out of tho&s;e evils and calamities, that God in his righteous anger has inflicted, and being re&s;tored to the &s;tate of ea&s;e and tranquility and outward pro&s;perity and happi|ne&s;s heretofore enjoyed.</P>
<P>It is natural to de&s;ire to be freed from evil and calamities, to be extricated out of public difficulties. And men are won't to be full of &s;chemes and contrivances and mo&s;t vigorous exer|tions, that they may be &s;o. But as there are &s;uch a variety of circum&s;tances and events, that mu&s;t concur in carrying them into execution, and as there are many circum&s;tances unfore&s;een and un|thought of, &s;o they &s;ometimes prove abortive. Men of the greate&s;t penetration and &s;agacity have failed in their expectations and pur&s;uits. In evil, and calamitous times, it is no doubt duty to con|trive
<PB N="20" REF="013388_0019_0F90950DFB8E42F8">
and endeavour after deliverance, and plain incumbent duty ought to be done. But then, neither individuals nor collective bodies of men can command the event. This is beyond their power, it is very plain from the manner of expre&s;|&s;ion in our text, that tho' it is our duty to humble our&s;elves under God's mighty hand, yet the event is wholly with God, and that he will take his own way and time in cau&s;ing it to take place. That <HI>he</HI> may exalt you, when? You de&s;ire help and deliverance immediately, you think it be&s;t that it &s;hould be had without any delay. But if you are exalted or delivered, not only mu&s;t God bring it about but he will take his own time for it. <HI>In due time,</HI> the time the infinite wi&s;dom &s;ees fitte&s;t and be&s;t.</P>
<P>AND now I would ob&s;erve, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> as God is infinite in goodne&s;s, and delighteth to do good to his creat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">res, he never afflicts them willingly nor grieves <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">hem, &s;o he is never backward to appear for their help and deliverance when they &s;uitably and reverendly acknowledge him. As there is a moral cau&s;e for evils and calamities, which I have mentioned this day, even the &s;ins and tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions of a people, &s;o upon the foundation of rea&s;on and &s;cripture the removal of them may only be expected when this cau&s;e is removed. Or as we may thus expre&s;s it. As the immoralities and vices of a people, cau&s;es God to lift up his mighty hand again&s;t them, and they are brought into great di&s;tre&s;s and perplexity, &s;o as it is writ|ten, <HI>righteou&s;ne&s;s exalteth a nation</HI> or people, repentance and reformation, and the practice of

univer&s;al righteou&s;ne&s;s, is the mo&s;t likely method to take in order to their being exalted, delivered from evils and re&s;tored to a &s;tate of ea&s;e, tranquili|ty and public happine&s;s. Yea, it is repre&s;ented in &s;cripture, that repentance and reformation, is the way to keep off divine calamities, &s;uch as a land lies expo&s;ed to, &amp; which &s;eems to be ha&s;tening on, and to be continued in a pro&s;perous &amp; happy &s;tate. And &s;o on the other hand, the impenitence &amp; indulged moral evils, were preventive of the good &amp; felicity, which God thought to confer upon it. Hence we have that of the prophet <HI>Jeremiah</HI> xviii. 7, 8, 9, 10. <HI>At what in&s;tant I &s;hall &s;peak concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom, to pluck up, and to pull down, and to de&s;troy it: If that nation again&s;t whom I have pronounced, turn from their evil: I will repent of the evil I thought to do un|to them.

I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter"> it do evil in my &s;ight, that it obey not my voice, then I will repent of the good wherewith I &s;aid I would benefit them.</HI></P>
<P>IF, when it &s;eems as tho' God's mighty hand, was ju&s;t ready to fall upon them, to di&s;tre&s;s them, &amp; ven ruin &amp; de&s;troy them, if the nation or people take the alarm, (as one ob&s;erves) &amp; repent of their &s;ins, and reform their lives, turn every one from his evil way, and return to God, God will graci|ou&s;ly accept them, will not proceed in his con|trover&s;y, will return in mercy to them, and tho' he cannot change his mind, he will change his way, &s;o as that it may be &s;aid, he repents him of the evil he &s;aid he would do to them. Thus of|ten
<PB N="22" REF="013388_0021_0F90950F78AE6FE0">
in the time of the Judges, when the oppre&s;|&s;ed people were penitent people, &s;till God rai&s;ed them up Saviours, and when they turned to God, their affairs pre&s;ently took a new turn. And &s;o if a nation or people whom God has loaded with benefits, do evil in his &s;ight, and obey not his voice, if it lo&s;e its virtue, and become debauch'd and prophane, if religion grow into contempt, and vice get to be fa&s;hionable, and &s;o be kept in countenance and reputation, and there be a gene|ral decay of &s;erious godline&s;s among them, then God will turn his hand again&s;t them, will pluck up what he was planting, and pull down what he was building. What favours were further de&s;ign|ed &s;hall be withheld. That God hurried I&s;rael back into the wilderne&s;s, when he had brought them within &s;ight of Canaan. Sin defeats Gods kind intentions concerning a people, baffles their plea&s;ing expectations from him. It ruins their comforts, prolongs their grievances, brings them into &s;traits, and retards their deliverance. <HI>I&s;aiah</HI> lix. 1, 2. <HI>Behold the Lord's hand is not &s;hortned, that it cannot &s;ave: Neither his ear heavy, that it cannot hear: But your iniquities have &s;eparated between you and your God, and your &s;ins have hid his face from you, that he will not hear.</HI></P>

And accordingly it &s;o happened <HI>God aw their works, that they turned rom their evil way, and God repented of the evil that he had &s;aid he would do unto them, and he did it not.</HI> Jonah iii, la&s;t ver&s;e.</P>
<P>AND I would ju&s;t ob&s;erve here, that we &s;hall find for the mo&s;t part be&s;u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">e, that the fa&s;ts that were ob&s;erved under the old te&s;tament, were &s;o on account of evils impending, or brought on, through the righteou&s;anger of God for the abound|ing wickedne&s;&s;es and immoralities in one place and in another.</P>
<P>THUS it was as to the fa&s;t at Nineveh, we ju&s;t made mention of. And thus it was as to the fa&s;t ob&s;erved in the days of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, <HI>Jeremiah</HI> 36, 9. <HI>And it came to pa&s;s in the fifth year of</HI> Jehoiakim <HI>&amp;c. That they proclaimed a fa&s;t before the Lord to all the people in Jeru&s;alem,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>THE occa&s;ion of that day of fa&s;ting we have in the 6, &amp; 7. ver&s;es. And &s;o I might mention other in|&s;tances. It is plain from the in&s;tances mention'd, that they did not fa&s;t for &s;trife or debate, or to &s;mite with the fi&s;t of wickedne&s;s, they did not do &s;o from any &s;ini&s;ter views and de&s;igns, but they did &s;o from the &s;en&s;e of the anger of God that was out a|gain&s;t them, for the evils and abominations they had committed in his &s;ight. And this it is, &s;uch a &s;en&s;e of things as this, that only can give pro|priety
<PB N="24" REF="013388_0023_0F909515C3604DB8">
to the ob&s;ervance of &s;uch days now as well as formerly. And when days of fa&s;ting are ob|&s;erved after &s;uch a manner it is a token for good, that God has favours in &s;tore for the people.</P>
<P>WE have ob&s;erved that God has &s;ometimes averted impending evils, &s;uch as a &s;inful people have been imminently expo&s;ed to, and had the utmo&s;t rea&s;on to expect, when they have repented and returned to him, as was the ca&s;e with Nine|veh. And it may from hence be fairly argued, that he is ready to remove evils and calamities, which are already felt, when God beholds them humbled under his mighty hand, repenting and returning to him. The great end of public di&s;|tre&s;&s;es and calamities, is the repentance and refor|mation of the nation and land who are vi&s;ited with them. And when this end is an&s;wered, may it not be expected that God will return to them in ways of favour and kindne&s;s, that he will de|light to do them good with all his heart, to &s;mile upon them in all their intere&s;ts and concerns, and make them a pro&s;perous happy people. As pub|lic vices tend to draw down public calamities, &s;o public vices and prevailing goodne&s;s tends to procure public ble&s;&s;ings. So that to humble our|&s;elves under the mighty hand of God, is the mo&s;t likely method to be exalted in due time, the time that infinite wi&s;dom thinks be&s;t: The all-wi&s;e God knows better when to appear for the help of a humbled, penitent, reformed people, and to extricate them out of their troubles and perplexities, than they can pre&s;cribe to him. And when they have complied with his requirements
<PB N="25" REF="013388_0024_0F909516ECB25648">
it is their wi&s;dom and their duty humbly to refer events to him, to order them out when and as he &s;ees fitte&s;t and be&s;t. To be in the hands of in|finite wi&s;dom mo&s;t certainly is to be in the be&s;t hands.</P>
<P>I &s;hall only add here, what Mo&s;es in God's name &s;ays to the people of I&s;rael, after pronounc|ing a variety of ble&s;&s;ings upon them, upon their approving them&s;elves an obedient people. <HI>Deut.</HI> xxviii. from the 9th ver&s;e, to the 14. <HI>The Lord &s;hall e&s;tabli&s;h thee an holy people unto him&s;elf, if thou &s;hall keep the commandments of the Lord thy God, and walk in his ways.

Nor unle&s;s this is the ca&s;e with us, may we upon any good and &s;olid grounds, expect this. For as &s;in is a reproach to a people, &s;o it has a tendency, both naturally, and morally, to de&s;truc|tion and ruin.</P>
<P>As to religion, that, which is pure and undefiled before God and the Father, perhaps there has been as great a proportion of this in New-England, as in any part of the chri&s;tian world.</P>
<P>THE fathers of this land were actuated from this noble principle in for&s;aking their native country, and their many near and dear connexions and fair inheritances, and enterpri&s;ing the &s;ettle|ment of this howling wilderne&s;s. Religion ap|peared in its true glory and lu&s;tre, in the early times of this country. There was a great regard to the holy &s;criptures, a great regard to the holy &s;abbaths and public wor&s;hip: And they would go great di&s;tances willingly and chearfully, ra|ther than be deprived of &s;uch precious advantages and privileges. There was a great regard to family wor&s;hip, in&s;truction and government, there was much of kindne&s;s, brotherly-love and charity in tho&s;e puritanic times. And prophane cur&s;ing and &s;wearing was a rare thing indeed, and many enormities and vicious practices, which have greatly obtained in modern times, were &s;carce|ly known among them. I don't mean to repre&s;ent that generation as ab&s;olutely perfect, for this is incompatible to the pre&s;ent &s;tate. Neverthele&s;s they were very generally, a very excellent &s;et of men.

fragrant as the precious ointment. And the holy and righteous God own'd and honour'd them accordingly. That righteou&s;ne&s;s, which was &s;o con&s;picuous among them, greatly exalted them. God was with them and for them, and who then could be again&s;t them? Verily none, and &s;o it appeared, for by a variety of remarkable inter|po&s;itions of his providence, God drove out the heathen before them, prepared room for them&punc; and they pro&s;pered and increa&s;ed under the &s;miles of heaven, and laid a broad foundation for tho&s;e that come after them to build upon. And a grand and noble &s;uper&s;tructure has been rai&s;ed upon it, as we &s;ee at this day: And particularly &s;ince the conclu&s;ion of the la&s;t war, in which the country of <HI>Canada,</HI> that was &s;o long a &s;courge to us, &s;ince, I &s;ay, that country has been &s;ubjected to the Briti&s;h empire, what a &s;urpri&s;ing &s;pread and increa&s;e has there been to the Engli&s;h terri|tories!</P>
<P>THE primitive, religious con&s;titution of this country was very excellent, and under the &s;miles and ble&s;&s;ing of the God of grace, has been abun|dantly affectual to &s;ub&s;erve the ends of vital piety, and godline&s;s, and the purpo&s;es of redeeming grace.

For however regardle&s;s many may be of the go&s;pel and the &s;piritual and everla&s;ting ble&s;&s;ings of it, yet it &s;eems to be the general opinion that the chri&s;tian mini&s;|try is an excellent in&s;titution, con&s;idered only in a civil and political light. And I would ju&s;t &s;ay further here; that if it was wholly &s;uppre&s;&s;ed and bani&s;hed the land, we &s;hould be in a &s;ituation not far &s;uperior to that of the aboriginal natives.</P>
<P>WE have had an excellent civil con&s;titution, good and whol&s;ome laws, the due execution of which, have produced the mo&s;t &s;alutary, and beneficial effects. At pre&s;ent, this people are thrown into great di&s;tre&s;s and perplexity thro' the operation of certain <HI>acts</HI> of the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> legi&s;lature, impo&s;ing duties and taxes upon them, which, if the right it claims &s;hould be granted, yet mu&s;t be looked upon by all, as contrary to the principles of &s;ound policy, con&s;idering the intercour&s;e be|tween the Parent &s;tate and the Colonies, and the va&s;t commercial intere&s;t maintained between them to their mutual benefit and advantage.</P>
<P>VERY &s;ad is the pre&s;ent &s;ituation of our <HI>capital town,</HI> blocked up by a powerful &s;quadron, to the cramping it's navigation and commerce, and to the impoveri&s;hment and di&s;tre&s;s of multitudes. And this di&s;tre&s;s that has befallen it, mu&s;t have it's influence upon the whole community. If the <HI>head</HI> &s;uffers, the <HI>members</HI> mu&s;t in many re&s;pects &s;uffer with it.&mdash;May God afford deliverance in due time, and give us occa&s;ion to rejoice in the

kind interpo&s;itions of his providence in removing this and every other difficulty and grievance! For we ought to bear this in mind, that our main de|pendance in the ca&s;e is upon his over-ruling pro|vidence. We are not to tru&s;t in an arm of fle&s;h, but in the Lord Jehovah, in whom is everla&s;ting &s;trength. Unto him are we to pray,&mdash;and unto him mu&s;t we return,&mdash;that he may return in favour to us. <HI>Turn us again, O God of ho&s;ts, cau&s;e thy face to &s;hine; and we &s;hall be &s;aved.</HI> It is at pre&s;ent, as has been &s;aid, a time of great per|plexity and di&s;tre&s;s. But are we to look altoge|ther to the dark &s;ide of things? Is there no bright &s;ide to turn to? Yes verily, there is. Thus, it is a remarkable time of health throughout the land: We hear of no contagious, mortal &s;ickne&s;s prevail|ing any where: We have not this &s;ea&s;on been vi&s;ited with &s;corching droughts, with devouring in&s;ects. We have had the refre&s;hing rains and &s;hines of heaven, and the fruits of the earth nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;upport of man and bea&s;ts, were perhaps never in a more flouri&s;hing &s;tate, nor a better pro&s;pect of a plentiful increa&s;e.</P>
<P>WE yet enjoy our quiet &s;abbaths, and chri&s;tian in&s;titutions, the day and the means of grace. And &s;o I might mention many other favours and ble&s;&s;ings of heaven. So that notwith&s;tanding all our difficulties and grievances, yet our &s;tate is not ab&s;olutely forlorn and de&s;perate. We have a bright &s;ide to look to, and ought to look to it; we have great rea&s;on for thankfulne&s;s to the great Governour of the world, at the &s;ame time that we have much cau&s;e for humiliation before him

con&s;idering the moral grounds and rea&s;ons of this controver&s;y with us.</P>
<P>WE are de&s;irous of being extricated out of all our difficulties, and enjoying public good and happine&s;s of every kind. Now the &s;ubject I have been di&s;cour&s;ing upon, directs us to the mo&s;t effectual method to betake our&s;elves to, in order to this. The way to be exalted, is to humble our&s;elves under the mighty hand of God. All &s;chemes and plans that may be laid, all endeavours that may be u&s;ed, are not of that importance, nor will they be likely to be &s;o efficacious, as &s;ecur|ing the friend&s;hip, the guardian-&s;hip and pro|tection of the God of heaven, who has all events and all hearts in his hands, and who can in the mo&s;t &s;urprizing, unexpected manner, &s;catter dark clouds, change the face of things, bring good out of evil, and open a fair, bright and refre&s;h|ing &s;cene, turn our mourning into dancing, put off our &s;ackcloth and gird us with gladne&s;s. O! what a great thing is it, to have the omnipotent God engage on the &s;ide of a people! Every thing then mu&s;t go well with them in &s;pite of all ob|&s;tructions and oppo&s;itions. For <HI>there is no wi&s;|dom, nor under&s;tanding, nor coun&s;el again&s;t the Lord.</HI> Prov 21, 30.</P>
<P>THERE is none that can avail any thing any more than for a worm to pretend to cope with a Lion.</P>
<P>BUT in order that we may enjoy the friend&s;hip of God and be under his &s;miles and ble&s;&s;ings, we mu&s;t on our part be in friend&s;hip with him. And then only are we &s;o, when we are brought
<PB N="32" REF="013388_0031_0F9095209E54C928">
to that repentance and reformation that we have &s;poken of this day. This verily is of very great importance in regard of God's glory, and as we would con&s;ult our own good and pro&s;perity even at pre&s;ent. O that there were &s;uch an heart in us all, and in this whole people, that we may humble our&s;elves under the mighty hand of God that he may exalt us in due time. If vice and wickedne&s;s, e&s;pecially in all its gro&s;&s;er forms was &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, and piety and virtue, righteou&s;ne&s;s, temperance, charity &amp;c. were generally to pre|vail in the mid&s;t of us, what a token for good would this be! We might then &s;ecurely depend upon God's kind care and protection, and that his ble&s;&s;ing would be upon us in all regards. But now, in&s;tead of the prevalence of the&s;e duties and virtues, is it not too evident, that we are <HI>a people laden'd with iniquity,</HI> notwith&s;tanding all the goodne&s;s of God that he has manife&s;ted to us, and notwith&s;tanding all his frowns and di&s;|plea&s;ure, which by our iniquities we have pro|cured?</P>
<P>CAN it be &s;aid that the troubles, perplexities and difficulties of the pre&s;ent day have produced a general repentance and reformation of manners? May it not be truly &s;aid, that the lu&s;ts and cor|ruptions of many have greatly and unhappily o|perated, which in&s;tead of dimini&s;hing have very much increa&s;ed our troubles! What jealou&s;ies and re&s;entments have been entertained among old friends, neighbours and relatives? What hard and opprobrious names have been given to one another! What a di&s;po&s;ition to rai&s;e
<PB N="33" REF="013388_0032_0F909520C1BD9268">
and propagate fal&s;e reports without regarding the mi&s;chievous con&s;equences of them! Yea, what wrath and malice, bitterne&s;s, clamour and evil|&s;peaking has there been! How much horrible prophane&s;s and impiety has there been, to the di&s;honour of God, to the eating out the very vitals of religion, the religion of the ble&s;&s;ed Je&s;us, which breaths a quite different &s;pirit, and tending al&s;o to the de&s;truction of the very form of it.</P>
<P>SUCH evils as the&s;e, alas! how greatly prevalent have they been in the&s;e days, in which the mighty hand of God has been lifted up again&s;t us! Nor is his anger turned away, but his hand is &s;tretched out &s;till. It is far from being agreable to me, in it&s;elf con&s;idered, to enumerate the evils of the times, but I &s;hould not be faithful if I did not. And all who are them&s;elves con&s;cientious, mu&s;t approve of faithfulne&s;s in others.</P>
<P>I WOULD now offer a few things by way of coun&s;el, hoping they will be received and prac|tically regarded.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, let every one &s;earch and try his own heart and ways, humble him&s;elf before God, implore forgivene&s;s through Chri&s;t, and grace for the future, to live in a holy, obedient manner. If it &s;hould be thus with every one, then reformation would be general And in this ca&s;e we might hope to be highly exalted.</P>
<P>Again,</P>
<P>LET it be the care of every one to get po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a &s;pirit of charity and brotherly kindne&s;s. This is of very great importance to the comfort and well|being of &s;ocieties, both the greater and the le&s;s.
<PB N="34" REF="013388_0033_0F909521E0F9B238">
For where there is contention, there is confu&s;ion and every evil work. In almo&s;t all matters, civil, &s;ecular and religious, a diver&s;ity of &s;entiments takes place among&s;t mankind. It is in vain to expect, that in all things they will be of the &s;ame mind and of the &s;ame judgment. And therefore a great deal of forbearance, candour, conde&s;cen&s;ion, meekne&s;s and charity is nece&s;&s;ary. Per&s;ons may and ought to be good neighbours and friends, and to treat one another as brethren, however they may be of different opinions from one another in many matters.</P>
<P>BROTHERLY kindne&s;s and charity, as it is a great chri&s;tian duty, &s;o it is the beauty, &s;trength and glory of &s;ocieties. It tends greatly to alle|viate burdens and to &s;weeten life. I &s;hall only ju&s;t add her, the fine and beautiful de&s;cription of charity in the 1<HI>&s;t</HI> epi&s;tle to the <HI>Corinth</HI> 13<HI>th</HI> chap. 4. 8. <HI>Charity &s;uffereth long, and is kind; charity envieth not; charity vaunteth not it&s;elf, is not puffed up, doth not behave it&s;elf un&s;eemly, &s;eeketh not her own, is not ea&s;ily provoked, thinketh no evil, rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth: Beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things.</HI></P>
<P>ANOTHER thing I would mention, relative to the ob&s;ervation of this day. Some may not &s;ee their way clear to ob&s;erve it, it not being enjoin'd in the u&s;ual way.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>The ob&s;ervation of this day was not, as u&s;ual, by a pro|clamation from the civil authority. It appears that the late Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives applied to his Excellency Governor GAGE that a public fa&s;t might be appointed. But at his Excellency was not plea&s;ed to comply with &s;aid motion; it was voted in the hou&s;e, that the Repre&s;entatives upon their return home, apply to their re&s;pective Pari&s;h Mini&s;ters that &s;uch a day might be ob&s;erved. Having been applied to according|ly, and finding upon laying it before the congregation in this place, which I th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">'t but a ju&s;t re&s;pect to them notwith&s;tanding &s;aid application, and perceiving that it was very generally de|&s;ired, the day was ob&s;erved. And I have the plea&s;ure to declare that there was not the lea&s;t di&s;order upon &s;aid day. Many re|&s;pectable per&s;ons who did not &s;ee &s;o clearly into the propriety of it, yet being unwilling to give offence to their neighbours and brethren, laid a&s;ide all their &s;ecular concerns, and with but few exceptions attended the public exerci&s;es. And I would fur|ther declare, that &s;o far as I had opportunity to ob&s;erve among my people, the principle that &s;eemed to govern them, was not an oppo&s;ition to government, but from a &s;en&s;e they profe&s;&s;ed to have of the frowns of heaven upon us, and the propriety of imploring God's gracious and powerful interpo&s;ition.</HI></NOTE> Now as no one is under
<PB N="35" REF="013388_0034_0F90952242BFB088">
any compul&s;ion in the ca&s;e, &s;o I would earne&s;tly advi&s;e that there may be no hard and &s;evere re|flections ca&s;t upon any, and that there be no uncivil, indecent conduct towards any upon the occa&s;ion. Let there be nothing incon&s;i&s;tent with the character of men and chri&s;tians. This will doubtle&s;s be productive of the mo&s;t &s;alutary and comfortable effects. Again,</P>
<P>WITH re&s;pect to tho&s;e that have been de&s;irous of the ob&s;ervation of this day, (and this &s;eems to be very general) I would &s;ay that you ought to regard it as unto the Lord. Do not you hereby profe&s;s to do honour to the great Governor of the world, to expre&s;s your unworthine&s;s before him, your dependance upon him, to acknowledge and bewail your &s;ins which have occa&s;ioned him to lift up his mighty hand, and to bring us into difficulties and di&s;tre&s;&s;es, to implore his forgive|ne&s;s and the return of his favour. Tho&s;e that
<PB N="36" REF="013388_0035_0F9095230C55A378">
are &s;incere and hearty in all this, may upon good grounds hope and expect that God will accept them therein. You mean the &s;olemnity of this day, bre|thren! or the attendance upon it, as an act of re|ligion. Now won't you all of you carry the religion of this day into your families? Won't you con|&s;ider it as your duty, be&s;ides joining in the pub|lick prayers of the &s;anctuary, to offer up your prayers and &s;upplications to the divine maje&s;ty in your hou&s;es, for tho&s;e favours and ble&s;&s;ings from him that are peculiarly needed in the pre&s;ent day, and which we have publickly &s;pread before God? Or does this day's ob&s;ervance compleat the whole affair?</P>
<P>MAY it not ju&s;tly be expected by God him&s;elf that a genuine repentance and reformation will follow this days &s;olemnity? &s;hall it be &s;aid that any after this go on in prophane&s;s, intempe|rance, uncha&s;tity, in fraud and oppre&s;&s;ion, in bit|terne&s;s, wrath, malice, anger, di&s;hone&s;ty, un|righteou&s;ne&s;s, &s;abbath breaking, neglecting the public wor&s;hip of God? Shall it be &s;aid after this, that there are any more prayerle&s;s families, that live like heathens, not calling upon the name of the Lord? I mu&s;t &s;peak freely and faithfully here, that I fear that there are a great many pray|erle&s;s families among you, and I mu&s;t earne&s;tly expo&s;tulate with you upon this head. Why will you thus live without God in the world? Are you afraid or a&s;hamed to acknowledge your Maker and daily benefactor? Can you live with|out him, live independant on him? You &s;urely will not acknowledge this, unle&s;s your are pro|fe&s;&s;ed
<PB N="37" REF="013388_0036_0F909523C8BE9620">
Athei&s;ts. But I am well per&s;waded that none of you are of this abandoned cla&s;s of mor|tals. You acknowledge, all of you, I pre&s;ume that there is a God, and that you are ab&s;olutely dependant upon him for public, per&s;onal and family ble&s;&s;ings. And will you not then erect an altar for him in your hou&s;es, whereon to offer religious &s;acrifices daily, morning and evening? How can you expect the ble&s;&s;ing of God upon your per&s;ons or families, if you neglect having any concern with him in the way I have now mentioned? I mu&s;t earne&s;tly exhort &s;uch as have hitherto neglected family wor&s;hip, that they im|mediately &s;et it up, and not to make a bye bu&s;ine&s;s of it, but con&s;tantly to attend it. Con&s;ider what you owe to your children. They are committed to your care not only to provide for their outward welfare and comfort, but to train them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord. And is it likely that they will have any &s;en&s;e of God or religion if they &s;ee their parents live in the neglect of &s;uch a plain incumbent duty, as that of family-wor&s;hip is? And will no religion, the mo&s;t important thing in the world, be lo&s;t among the ri&s;ing generation if you go on in &s;uch a neglect? I hope what I have now &s;aid upon this matter will be &s;eriou&s;ly laid to heart by tho&s;e of you to whom it is e&s;pecially applicable. And may it plea&s;e God to render it effectual to bring about a reformation in this matter! And I would ju&s;t add in a word, that it will ill become tho&s;e to live in the neglect of family-wor&s;hip, who have di&s;covered a zeal, that this day of fa&s;ting

and prayer be ob&s;erved on account of our public difficulties.</P>
<P>I SHALL now clo&s;e all with briefly &s;aying. That while you are in &s;uch anxiety re&s;pecting your civil liberties, it infinitely concerns you, that you be in earne&s;t that you may have a &s;hare in the glorious liberties and privileges of the children of God. Civil liberty it is acknowledged is a mo&s;t valuable enjoyment. And what all are earne&s;tly de&s;irous of the enjoyment of. And as every one is de&s;i|rous of it for him&s;elf, &s;o every one ought to be willing that his neighbour &s;hould enjoy it. But is it acting a con&s;i&s;tent part to vili&s;y and reproach others, becau&s;e they take that liberty which God and nature have given them to think and &s;peak differently from them? No one can &s;oberly pre|tend this. No doubt all aim at the &s;ame thing, whatever difference there may be in opinion and conduct. Let us remember, Brethren! That the pre&s;ent &s;cene will quickly be clo&s;ed upon us. And we &s;hall have no more any concern with the affairs, and tran&s;actions of the pre&s;ent &s;tate. And if we get to heaven, as God in his in|finite mercy thro' Chri&s;t grant we all may, we &s;hall there be all of one heart and &s;oul There harmony, love and peace will univer&s;ally take place. There we &s;hall enjoy liberty of the right &s;ort, be eternally free from the bondage of Satan and our own corruptions, and all the penal effects of them, and love God, and love one another en|tirely and &s;incerely, and with the utmo&s;t freedom and chearfulne&s;s, &s;erve and glorify God and the Lamb throughout eternal ages.</P>
