<Q><HI>Howbeit, thou art Ju&s;t in all that is brought upon us: for thou ha&s;t done right, but we have done wickedly:</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THAT there is a certain and mo&s;t exact Providence of God, over all the Affairs of Man-kind in this World, from the highe&s;t unto the meane&s;t and mo&s;t minute, incon&s;idera|ble things, and all the circum&s;tances of them; is a truth &s;o great, &s;o plain and obvious, that it is agreed upon both in Rea&s;on and Religion; as may be gathered from the Apo&s;tles quota|tion, Act. 17. 28. <HI>For in him we live and move and have our being</HI>&mdash;: It is true al&s;o that the My&s;teries of Common, but e&s;pecially of &s;pecial Pro|vidence, are &s;o great, &s;o deep, &s;o wonderful and &s;ometimes &s;o amaze|ing, that men are fain to &s;tand &s;till, and &s;ay as in <HI>Job</HI> 11. 8. <HI>It is as high as heaven, what can&s;t thou do? deeper then hell, what can&s;t thou know?</HI> And 'tis at no time more &s;o than in the way of God's Judgments, and mo&s;t of all when his own People are the Subjects of tho&s;e Judgments; then oft times there is occa&s;ion to Repeat and Ruminate upon that Excla|mation, <HI>Rom.</HI> 11. 33. <HI>How un&s;earchable are his Judgments and his Ways pa&s;t finding out!</HI> But, be the Premi&s;es of this kind what they will, we mu&s;t alway ob&s;tinately hold fa&s;t that &s;ure Conclu&s;ion, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 36. 6. <HI>Thy Righte|ou&s;ne&s;s is like the great mountains; thy Judgments are a great deep:</HI> or el&s;e we &s;hall make Shipwrack of Faith and a good Con&s;cience in the&s;e great deeps. And in this Chapter wherein our Text is; We may ob&s;erve the method and pains which <HI>Nehemiah,</HI> and the Godly <HI>Jews</HI> with him, take for the clearing up, and e&s;tabli&s;hing of this Conclu&s;ion, as 'tis laid down in our Text. This <HI>Nehemiah</HI> did unto that poor afflicted People an&s;wer his name; the Comfort or the Re&s;t of the Lord: For in that cri|tical

and trouble&s;ome Juncture, much of their Comfort and Re&s;t from the Lord, was conveyed unto them by his in&s;trumentality: he was the In&s;trument of procuring for, and &s;ettling among them, the revival of their former precious and plea&s;ant things in a great degree, after the <HI>Babyloni&s;h</HI> Captivity.</P>
<P>He was by birth a <HI>Jew;</HI> by quality a Courtier belonging to the Em|perour of <HI>Per&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">,</HI> the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">reate&s;t Monarch in the World; by office the Go|vernour of the <HI>Jews</HI> his Brethren; by Prece&s;&s;ion and Practice <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">n holy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters">d zealous&punc; Servant of the true God; he was a man of mo&s;t Excellent Spirit, retaining and maintaining&punc; a firm and &s;tedfa&s;t integrity, an in|violate, un&s;train'd and exemplary fidelity to his God, his Religion and his Country; all temptations, entanglements, and enchantments of the Court, he had been &s;o long Conver&s;ant in notwith&s;tanding; and &s;erved and was accepted of his Prince in &s;erving his God and his Country, &s;et|ling and &s;trengthening of them in Church and State, managing with a prudent, pious, gracious and &s;ucce&s;sful Conduct, for more than fifty years. And herein join'd in a mo&s;t &s;weet, happy and &s;atisfactory una|nimity with them, with the Rulers, with the Prie&s;ts, with the Levites, and the Re&s;t of his Brethren.</P>
<P>In Pro&s;ecution of which in this Nineth Chapter, he and they do &s;o|lemnly and publickly take notice of the Scheme of Gods wayes unto that People, and their wayes unto him; and do Alternately touch upon &s;ome of the main points of both, from their beginning unto that time: Until at length in this 33. <HI>v.</HI> the words of our Text, they come unto and fix upon, a very&punc; &s;olemn Vindication of the Name of God; by a&s;&s;erting his Ju&s;tice in all his Judicial proceedings again&s;t and dealings with them, together with a clo&s;e Animadver&s;ion upon them&s;elves.</P>
<P>The Words may be look't upon under a threefold Con&s;ideration.</P>
<P N="1">1. Either as a brief, &s;ummary, but &s;ad and &s;orrowful Recapitulation, and Repre&s;entation of their own Lamentable E&s;tate, and the ill terms they were in with the Lord their God,&mdash;<HI>In all that is brought upon us</HI>&mdash;God had brought many and dreadful things upon them, which they had now the fre&s;h and lively &s;en&s;e of.</P>
<P N="2">2. Or as an humble and penitential Confe&s;&s;ion of their own Sins, a|gain&s;t the Lord their God; an holy, and ju&s;t, and good, and gracious God; they do with &s;hame of face and grief of heart confe&s;s; That tho' God had been very &s;harp and &s;evere with them, yet they were them|&s;elves the only Culpable and procuring Cau&s;es of all.&mdash;<HI>For we have done Wickedly.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. Or as a te&s;timonial Vindication given in, and to be left upon Re|cord for God; to clear him and his Cau&s;e, in the whole Controver&s;y between him and them.&mdash;<HI>Howbeit thou art Ju&s;t.</HI>&mdash;There are then two Branches of the Text.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="3" REF="001193_0005_0FB0FEB3AD6F12B0">
1. A Ju&s;tification of God, with re&s;pect unto his Judgments inflicted upon his own and only People, the People of <HI>I&s;rael:</HI> And this argued from his Works, and in particular from his Works of Judgment, which they had been the Subjects of. <HI>Howbeit thou art Ju&s;t in all that is brought upon us; for thou ha&s;t done right: q. d.</HI> Be the Ca&s;e how it will with us, and indeed it is bad enough, &s;ad enough, and dreadful enough, as to things pa&s;t and pre&s;ent, and di&s;mal pre&s;ages there are for the future; yet we mu&s;t and do, freely and openly Ju&s;tify the Lord our God, in and under all&punc;</P>
<P N="2">2. A Condemnation of them&s;elves; with re&s;pect unto their own Sins; their Condemnation is argued from their Works, and their Works of Iniquity.&mdash;<HI>But we have done wickedly;</HI> it is in plain, full, downright termes, without any extenuation, or mincing the matter. So that the Doctrine which re&s;ults from hence is this.</P>
<P>Doct. <HI>That although the Judgments which God brings upon his own Sinning People, are very many, and exceeding great; yet He is mo&s;t Ju&s;t in all of them.</HI></P>
<P>They do in our Text make a plump and full acknowledgment of this Truth: when the Ca&s;e between God and them&s;elves comes to be con&s;idered, they do before the whole World, Heaven and Earth, give in clear and full evidence to this Truth, however it does reflect upon them&s;elves; that God is mo&s;t Ju&s;t in all his Judgments upon them; and by parity of rea&s;on, the like te&s;timony mu&s;t be given for him, with re&s;pect to his proceedings again&s;t any other &s;uch people of his own, whom he &s;hall vi&s;it with his Judgments as he did them: And indeed this is a ruled and &s;ettled Ca&s;e: The Prophet is expre&s;s and ample in his at|te&s;tation hereto. Dan. 9. 14.&mdash;<HI>For the Lord our God is Righteous, (or Ju&s;t) in all his Works; i. e.</HI> in his works of Judgment upon his own People; for the&s;e are the works which the &s;cope of the Text is directed unto. Al&s;o that is very pertinent and pregnant for the Confirmation of this Truth which is given in and recorded, <HI>Ezra</HI> 9. 18.&mdash;<HI>O Lord God of I&s;rael thou art Righteous.</HI> Speaking of his Judgments which had overtaken, and taken hold of that Sinning People of the Lord. This Doctrine con&s;i&s;ts of four &s;ingle Propo&s;itions.</P>
<P>PROPOSITION <HI>I. That God's own People may be a very Sinful People.</HI> This People of the <HI>Jews</HI> were God's own and only People; they were &s;o by common E&s;timation, by Profe&s;&s;ion, and by &s;olemn Covenant-Tran&s;action, they had Avouched the Lord for their God, and God had Avouched them for his People; and yet they were a very Sinful Peo|ple: So it may be with any other People of God in this World: they may be &s;o really, not rightfully; there's no allowance for them to be
<PB N="4" REF="001193_0006_0FB0FEB531E2A910">
&s;o, but there's certain experience that they are &s;o. It was ob&s;erved by the Wi&s;e man of old, <HI>That there's not a Ju&s;t man upon the Earth that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> not:</HI> And this is a very forcible way of proving this Po&s;ition which he had then undertaken the demon&s;tration of. 1 <HI>King.</HI> 8. 46. There are al|ways Sins of Infirmity in the be&s;t per&s;ons, and in the be&s;t people in this World; but they are Sins of Enormity and gro&s;s Iniquity which are here &s;poken of: for they mu&s;t be &s;uch, to bring a People of God under the ju&s;t denomination of a Sinful People; and they are truly &amp; properly a Sinful People, when they are a Degenerate People, fallen off from God, from what they profe&s;s and pretend to be; &s;ometimes have been or by Covenant are bound to be; <HI>When they are turned into the degenerate plant of a &s;trange Vine unto God,</HI> Jer. 2. 21. When they have lo&s;t their piety towards God, their equity, hone&s;ty, charity and morality towards men; and the contrary, impiety, prophanity, im|morality and vitio&s;ity take place in&s;tead thereof; and this becomes their common and epidemical ca&s;e: As 'tis &s;aid to be, <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 1. 5, 6. <HI>The whole head is &s;ick, and the whole heart is faint;</HI> and they make a trade of Sin, and are accu&s;tomed unto Sin, <HI>Jer.</HI> 13. 23. they commit Sin as if it were their bu&s;ine&s;s, <HI>Ho&s;.</HI> 10. 13. <HI>Ye have plowed wickedne&s;s.</HI> When 'tis &s;o with a People of God, they are then a very &s;inful people: And that God's own People may become &s;uch is evident, not only from what the Holy Scriptures tell us others have been, but from what experience tells us we our &s;elves are. A lively and graphical Exemplification of this aw|ful truth, we have this day in our &s;elves.</P>
<P>PROP. II. <HI>That manifold and dreadful Judgments are the Proper, and will be the certain portion of God's People when they are become a very Sinful People.</HI> If God's People become a depraved, deformed, degenerate &s;inful people, they mu&s;t fall under the Severities of God's Judgments. <HI>Judgment mu&s;t begin at the Hou&s;e of God,</HI> 1 Pet. 4. 17. and they are &s;evere Judgments, <HI>Jer.</HI> 7. 19, 20. <HI>Do they provoke me to anger, faith the Lord? do they not provoke them&s;elves to the confu&s;ion of their own faces? Therefore thus faith the Lord God, Behold mine anger and my fury &s;hall be poured out upon this place, upon man, and upon bea&s;t, and upon the trees of the field, and upon the fruit of the ground, and it &s;hall burn, and &s;hall not be quenched.</HI> The&s;e Judgments of God, are all tho&s;e penal evils which are inflicted by God in a way of judicial proceeding; and whatever others do, God's own Sinning Peo|ple be&s;ure &s;hall not e&s;cape; <HI>Ames</HI> 3. 2. <HI>You only have I known of all the fa|milies of the earth: therefore I will puni&s;h you for all your iniquities.</HI> And there is an unparallel'd Severity in the Judgments of God upon his own Sin|ning People; there is no Severity in this World like it, unle&s;s it be that of the <HI>Sword of the Lord again&s;t the Man that is his fellow:</HI> thus much is

implyed in our Saviours words, <HI>Mat.</HI> 24. 21. <HI>For then &s;hall be great tribu|lation, &s;uch as was not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever &s;hall be.</HI></P>
<P>PROP. III. <HI>That the&s;e manifold and &s;evere Judgments, they are God's Judgments.</HI> All penal evil is from God, as the &s;upream, principal effi|cient cau&s;e of it, <HI>Amos</HI> 3. 6.&mdash;<HI>Shall there be evil in a City, and the Lord hath not done it?</HI> Deut. 32. 39. <HI>See now, that I, even I am he, and there is no God with me; I kill, and I make alive: I wound, and I heal: neither is there any that can deliver out of my hand,</HI> I&s;a. 48. 7.&mdash;<HI>I make peace and create evil:</HI>&mdash;Be the In&s;truments and Second Cau&s;es who &amp; what they will, God does plainly and peremptorily a&s;cribe and appropriate Judgment unto him&s;elf as his: <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 37. 26. <HI>Ha&s;t thou not heard long ago, how I have done it, and of ancient times that I have formed it? now have I brought it to pa&s;s:</HI>&mdash;God is the Author who does appoint &amp; inflict the&s;e Judgments; and he is the orderer and manager of them in the mea&s;ures, &s;teps and progre&s;s thereof, from fir&s;t to la&s;t, even to the lea&s;t circum&s;tance and accident thereof: <HI>Mat.</HI> 10. 30. <HI>But the very hairs of your head are all num|bred.</HI> The Judgment of all per&s;ons is from the Lord, <HI>Prov.</HI> 29. 26. <HI>But every mans judgment cometh from the Lord.</HI> The Judgment of all Nations is from the Lord, <HI>Hab.</HI> 3. 6. <HI>He &s;tood and mea&s;ured the earth: he beheld and drove a&s;under the nations:</HI> And therefore it mu&s;t needs be true concern|ing the Judgments which come upon his own People. This might be made illu&s;triou&s;ly evident, by a particular con&s;ideration of the Judg|ments which were inflicted upon the Jews in their Captivity; they were all of them the Lords Judgment, as to kind, time, degree, in&s;truments, extent, duration, i&s;&s;ue, effects and con&s;equents thereof; this is fully tho' briefly expre&s;&s;ed and a&s;&s;erted, 2 <HI>King.</HI> 21. 12, 13. <HI>Therefore thus faith the Lord God of I&s;rael, Behold, I am bringing &s;uch evil upon Jeru&s;alem &amp; Judah, that who&s;oever heareth of it, both his ears &s;hall tingle. And I will &s;tretch over Jeru&s;alem the line of Samaria, and the plummet of the hou&s;e of Ahab: and I will wipe Jeru&s;alem, as a man wipeth a di&s;h, wiping it, and turning it up&s;ide down.</HI></P>
<P>PROP. IV. <HI>That God is mo&s;t ju&s;t in all the&s;e Judgments of His.</HI> Tho' they are upon his own People, and are very many, and very great, yet God is mo&s;t ju&s;t or righteous in all of them: He is truly and &s;u|perlatively ju&s;t, or which is the &s;ame thing, Righteous in them all; in appointing and inflicting, ordering, continuing and i&s;&s;uing them, in all the parts, articles, circum&s;tances and punctilio's of them, from fir&s;t to la&s;t, from beginning to end; He is ab&s;olutely, perfectly, inviolably and infinitely ju&s;t and righteous. What's &s;aid of the Judgments of his mouth, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 19. 9. <HI>That they are righteous altogether;</HI> does &s;uit &amp; quadrate well with the Judgments of his hands. The Heavens make known
<PB N="6" REF="001193_0008_0FB0FEB921AD9118">
this, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 50. 6. <HI>The heavens &s;hall declare his righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> The Angels proclaim his Righteou&s;ne&s;s, <HI>Rev.</HI> 16. 5. He is fixed unchangeable and immoveable, as a Rock in regard of his Righteou&s;ne&s;s, <HI>Deut.</HI> 32. 4. <HI>He is the Rock, his work is perfect: for all his ways are judgment: a God of truth, and without iniquity, ju&s;t and right is he.</HI> He is univer&s;ally and everla&s;t|ingly &s;o, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 89. 14.&mdash;<HI>Ju&s;tice and Judgment are the Habitation of thy Throne.</HI> This is a &s;ure uncontroulable conclu&s;ion, tho' men can't al|ways &s;ee how to draw it out of the premi&s;es. This made the holy Prophet &s;ay, <HI>Jer.</HI> 12. 1. <HI>Righteous art thou, O Lord, when I plead with thee yet let me talk with thee of thy Judgments: Wherefore doth the way of the Wicked pro&s;per? Wherefore are all they happy that deal very treacherou&s;ly?</HI></P>
<P>This Ju&s;tice of God it is not his E&s;&s;ential but his Relative Ju&s;tice; whereby he gives unto all his Creatures that which does belong unto them. For as he is ju&s;t in him&s;elf, in his own Nature, <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 45. 21.&mdash;<HI>A ju&s;t God.</HI>&mdash;Altogether ju&s;t, and mo&s;t ju&s;t, even Ju&s;tice it &s;elf; &s;o he is ju&s;t in all his works and doings to his Creatures, and therefore in his Works of Judgments to his People: He renders to them tho&s;e Judg|ments which do of right belong unto them, according to a Rule of Ju&s;tice; and the Rule of Relative Ju&s;tice, it is the Will of God. God originally owes nothing to his Creatures, therefore that only is their due which he Willeth unto them, that Will of his therefore is the Rule of moral Ju&s;tice. The Will of purpo&s;e it is the Secret and Everla&s;ting Rule of this Ju&s;tice; His Will of Precept 'tis the Written Rule of this Ju&s;tice: And his Law con&s;idered as a Covenant, as 'tis under the Sancti|on of Promi&s;es and Threatnings, is the Rule according to which his own People may expect he will di&s;pen&s;e Ju&s;tice unto them, in the way of his Judgments. Again&s;t this Rule there is no exception to be made by us; no not again&s;t his Judgment of eternal Condemnation upon the Re|probate who peri&s;h, being Reprobated according to the Will of God; for their eternal Reprobation, and &s;o their Condemnation it is according to this righteous Rule of Ju&s;tice between God and man&punc; therefore the ble&s;&s;ed Apo&s;tle does with a di&s;dainful dete&s;tation reject the very thoughts of impeaching the Ju&s;tice of God, in the Reprobation of them that are according to Scripture Phra&s;e, <HI>hated of God;</HI> as it is Written, <HI>Jacob have I loved, but E&s;au have I hated. What &s;hall we &s;ay then? Is there unrighteou&s;|ne&s;s with God? God forbid.</HI> The Argument to prove it follows: <HI>For he faith to Mo&s;es, I will have mercy on whom I will have Mercy, and I will have Compa&s;&s;ion on whom I will have Compa&s;&s;ion,</HI> Rom. 9. 13, 14, 15. And it is added to clo&s;e all,&mdash;<HI>and whom he will he hardneth,</HI> 18. v. However impudent|ly and unrea&s;onably, and in defiance of the whole Scope of the Argu|mentation, &s;ome would under&s;tand the Apo&s;tle of Temporal Judgments of this Life, thereby to Enervate the Decree of Reprobation. And if
<PB N="7" REF="001193_0009_0FB0FEBA6F00D258">
this Judgment of God be &s;o uncontrolably Ju&s;t, becau&s;e it is according to, and the product of his Will; much more may we, and <HI>mu&s;t</HI> we con|clude that all tho&s;e Judgments &s;poken of in our Text and Doctrine; even the Judgments of God upon his own People, are mo&s;t Ju&s;t: for they are the accompli&s;hment of his Decree, which is altogether Ju&s;t; The Execution of his Law which is mo&s;t holy, ju&s;t and good: And the fulfilling of his Covenant in the ju&s;t threatnings thereof, which are put thereinto; <HI>if his Children for&s;ake my Law, and walk not in my Judg|ments; if they break my &s;tatutes and keep not my Commandments: Then will I vi&s;it their tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions with the Rod, and their iniquity with &s;tripes:</HI> And the&s;e are the Judgments of God upon his own People, in which He is mo&s;t ju&s;t.</P>
<P><HI>USE I.</HI> Hence we may infer, that there is an ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of the Atonement of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, to make Peace with God for us. When the Ju&s;tice of God is offended and provoked to proceed in a way of Vengeance, which is the work of provoked Ju&s;tice, inflict|ing Judgment upon the Sinner, there's nothing to be ju&s;tly expected, but the ju&s;t ruin and utter confu&s;ion of tho&s;e, who by their Sins have drawn it forth, unle&s;s there be an Atonement made: So God &s;peaks. <HI>A fire is kindled in mine anger, and &s;hall burn unto the lowe&s;t hell, and &s;hall con&s;ume the earth with her increa&s;e, and &s;et on fire the foundations of the mountains. I will heap mi&s;chiefs upon them, I will &s;pend mine arrows up|on them. They &s;hall be burnt with hunger, and devoured with burning heat, and with bitter de&s;truction:</HI> Deut. 32, 22, 23, 24. And this Vengeance will not be recalled, unle&s;s the Anger of God cea&s;e; and this Anger will not cea&s;e, unle&s;s provoked Ju&s;tice be atoned; and Ju&s;tice will be atoned only by the Satisfaction and Interce&s;&s;ion of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t.

<P><HI>USE II. EXHORTATION.</HI> And 'tis twofold.</P>
<P N="1">1. Let us be Exhorted to lament and amend our own Sins, Unrigh|teou&s;ne&s;s and Inju&s;tice before and towards God. God is truly and &s;u|perlatively ju&s;t and righteous, without any manner of unrighteou&s;ne&s;s; and this upon the utmo&s;t trial and experiment that can be made of him. We mu&s;t &s;ay, <HI>There's no unrighteou&s;ne&s;s in him, P&s;al.</HI> 92. 15. But there is unrighteou&s;ne&s;s and inju&s;tice in us; we have done <HI>wickedly.</HI> Righteou&s;ne&s;s in God 'tis his Nature and E&s;&s;ence; in man, Unrighte|ou&s;ne&s;s is his nature. <HI>Rom.</HI> 8. 7. And Righteou&s;ne&s;s 'tis of Grace, and 'tis the Image of God in him, and his acceptablene&s;s unto God: Un|righteou&s;ne&s;s 'tis the Image of the <HI>Devil,</HI> and di&s;plea&s;ing and contrary unto God; and for this God is di&s;plea&s;ed with us. The Servants and Me&s;&s;engers of God in this place, upon like Occa&s;ions, have with one mouth faithfully born witne&s;s again&s;t our Sins and Unrighteou&s;ne&s;&s;es; and if men &s;hould be &s;ilent, the&s;e <HI>Walls</HI> and the&s;e <HI>Pillars</HI> would te&s;tify a|gain&s;t us, that we have been Convicted for offending again&s;t the Rules, both of Commutative and Di&s;tributive Ju&s;tice: <HI>We have not given unto God the Glory due to his Name,</HI> to his Nature, to our own Bonds and Ob|ligations to him; nor have we rendred unto him according to the be|nefits, means, priviledges and Ble&s;&s;ings be&s;towed upon us. <HI>Hezekiah'</HI>s Sin has been too common among us. We han't Glorifyed God as God, nor been thankful: this is to be lamented and amended; and we &s;hould labour to deal truly herein, and not flatter and lye as they did,<HI><PB N="15" REF="001193_0017_0FB0FEC7AF4F2138">
P&s;al.</HI> 78. 36, 37. And if we do &s;o, <HI>God will be merciful to our Unrighteou&s;|ne&s;s, and he will remember our Sins no more,</HI> Heb. 8. 12. If otherwi&s;e, the Ca&s;e is determined, the Written doom will come;&mdash;<HI>The Lord knows to re&s;erve the Unju&s;t unto the day of Judgment to be puni&s;hed,</HI> 2 Pet. 2. 9.</P>
<P N="2">2. Let us be Exhorted, to dread and avoid the further provoking the Ju&s;tice of the Ju&s;t and Righteous God again&s;t us. For God is a <HI>Ju&s;t</HI> and <HI>Righteous</HI> God &s;till; and he is in the way of his Judgments: <HI>His Hand is &s;tretched out &s;till;</HI> and may be provoked unto &s;till greater degrees of Ju&s;t di&s;plea&s;ure again&s;t us. <HI>He is an Holy and Jealous God,</HI> Jo&s;h. 24. 19, 20. <HI>A terrible God:</HI>&mdash;Neh. 1. 5. None can be &s;o fooli&s;h and Athei&s;tical as to think, that God has &s;ent all his Judgments, and &s;pent all his Arrows upon us. The Anger of God yet to come, is as heavy and dreadful as we can fear it to be: <HI>According to thy fear &s;o is thy wrath,</HI> P&s;al. 90. 11. Taking the fear of God objectively, it refers unto that Article of the Hi&s;tory of <HI>I&s;raels</HI> travels in the Wilderne&s;s, which we have in <HI>Numb.</HI> 14. Where when the People had Committed that great and critical Sin of refu&s;ing to enter into the Land; and <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> told them how ill God re|&s;ented their evil carriage, they had awful and dreadful apprehen&s;ions of the Anger of God; and he tells them <HI>it was every way as great as they could conceive of.</HI> Therefore let us all in general take heed of irritating and exa&s;perating this Ju&s;t Anger, or this injured and provoked Ju&s;tice of God again&s;t us; Why &s;hould we provoke him, <HI>Are we &s;tronger than He?</HI> And therefore in General,</P>
<P N="1">1. Let us look to our <HI>Religion.</HI> This is mans glorifying of God and enjoying of him, <HI>and as it is the chief end of man;</HI> &s;o this was the main &amp; principal end of our Fore-fathers, tho&s;e men of <HI>Renown,</HI> who fir&s;t &s;tret|ched forth the&s;e Heavens, &amp; laid the foundations of this Earth; Setled a Chri&s;tian Religious State and Churches in this Country. And they have Committed their work and enterprize to us, and left us to par&s;ue and pro&s;ecute the &s;ame to effect: and whatever we do without this we do but trifle and <HI>Serio nihil Agere;</HI> and de&s;erve to be reproved for our neglect of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, as <HI>Luk.</HI> 10. 41. If our <HI>Religion</HI> be neglected or perverted, Gods offended Ju&s;tice will be further provoked and incen|&s;ed, and we &s;hall be more expo&s;ed. <HI>The Name of the Lord is a &s;trong tower whereunto the Righteous flee and are &s;afe,</HI> as <HI>Prov.</HI> 18. 10. Our <HI>Religion</HI> is our greate&s;t and be&s;t <HI>bulwark:</HI> If this be neglected our defence departs from us, and we &s;hall be as bread to our enemies, as they &s;aid, <HI>Numb.</HI> 14. 9. If we lo&s;e our <HI>Religion</HI> we lo&s;e <HI>All;</HI> and if we are cheated of our <HI>Reli|gion</HI> we are cheated of <HI>All:</HI> for, according to the word of our Lord CHRIST, <HI>All came with our Religion: Seek fir&s;t the Kingdom of God, and his Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and all the&s;e things &s;hall be added.</HI> And according to the

Word of God, all will go with our <HI>Religion. No&s;.</HI> 2. 9. <HI>Therefore will I return and take my Corn in the time thereof.</HI> Look well to Religion and we look well to All; Look well to the Soundne&s;s and Purity of Religion, in Heart, and Life, in Doctrine, and Practice, in Wor&s;hip and Di&s;cipline; or Chri&s;t will &s;ay as to <HI>Sardis,</HI>&mdash;<HI>I have not found thy ways perfect before God, Rev.</HI> 3. 2.

Look well to the Life and Power of Religion; or Je|&s;us Chri&s;t will nau&s;eate and &s;pue us out of his mouth, <HI>Rev.</HI> 3. 16. <HI>So then becau&s;e thou art Luke-warm and neither hot not cold, I will &s;pue thee out of my mouth.</HI> Look at tho&s;e as the wor&s;t Sins, that Hurt our Religion mo&s;t; as impenitence, unbelief, error, here&s;y, &s;uper&s;tition, hypocri&s;y, forma|lity, and all manner of Apo&s;tacy. And look at tho&s;e as our poore&s;t friends, that are not friends to our Religion; and tho&s;e as our wor&s;t Enemies who are Enemies to our Religion, who &s;trike at and hurt our Religion; the ca&s;e between &s;uch and us is much as it was &s;ometimes between the <HI>Syrian King,</HI> and <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> 1 <HI>King.</HI> 22. 31. Our Religion it is our Life,&mdash;And as he &s;aid, &s;o may we, <HI>Set your hearts to all the words which I te&s;tify to you this day,</HI>&mdash;<HI>for it is not a vain thing for you, for it is your life, Deut.</HI> 32. 46. They that would take away our Religion would take a|way our Lives: they would commit the wor&s;t Murder upon us. What that great Reformer <HI>Luther</HI> &s;aid of the Doctrine of Ju&s;tification; it is <HI>Articulus &s;tantis et Cadentis Eccle&s;iae;</HI> may we much more &s;ay of our Reli|gion, it is, <HI>Articulus &s;tantis et Cadentis Populi.</HI> If you dont look well to your Religion, Je&s;us Chri&s;t will &s;ay as to them, <HI>Luk.</HI> 13. 34, 35. <HI>Your Hou&s;e is left unto you de&s;olate.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Let us Labour to acquit our &s;elves well with re&s;pect unto <HI>Civil Government.</HI> Government it is Gods Ordinance: therefore as we &s;hould <HI>Fear God,</HI> &s;o &s;hould we <HI>Honour the King,</HI> 1 Pet. 2. 17. <HI>And the Powers that are among us, they are of God,</HI> Rom. 13. 1. It is a great mercy of God to us, all our difficulties &amp; unea&s;ine&s;&s;es which we labour under notwith&s;tand|ing: our Government is a great Mercy of God to us, and that which we ought to be truly thankful to him for. If it &s;hould degenerate into <HI>Tyranny, Anarchy,</HI> or &s;uch hard&s;hips as we hear &s;ome others groan under, we &s;hould &s;oon find the difference. Therefore let us labour to acquit our &s;elves well, and approve our &s;elves as good Chri&s;tians: as <HI>Paul</HI> did, <HI>Exerci&s;e our &s;elves herein to have a Con&s;cience void of offence towards God and towards man,</HI> Act. 16. 24.

<P><HI>I.</HI> Let this Exhortation be Pre&s;ented and Recommended unto tho&s;e among us who are betru&s;ted with the <HI>Civil Government.</HI> The betru&s;t|ment of the Government, whether it be the <HI>Legi&s;lative</HI> or the <HI>Executive</HI> part of it, or both, is great; God and his people have committed much unto You, and repo&s;ed great A&s;&s;urances in You: Therefore to You the Exhortation is, that You would con&s;ider and dread, and avoid any other further provoking the offended Ju&s;tice of God again&s;t us.

account of them, and their work and way now, and do indu&s;triou&s;ly, for&s;ake and reproach it, and condemn them for tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors; they that de&s;troy the things that are built up, make tho&s;e builders tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors, <HI>Gal.</HI> 2. 18.

All the Sons of <HI>Sion</HI> &s;hould be like the fine Gold, and this is like our fir&s;t golden Can|dle&s;ticks; thus &s;hould our people be brought back.</P>
<P>In particular,</P>
<P N="1">1. Let us labour to bring them back in regard of <HI>Principles,</HI> unto the fir&s;t <HI>Principles of our Fathers</HI> in <HI>New-England,</HI> after that they were &s;etled, and had cleared up things; &s;o that they did clearly, di&s;tinctly and pro|fe&s;&s;edly declare their principles &amp; publi&s;h them; the&s;e principles owned and avowed by them, and skreened from tho&s;e mi&s;interpretations which &s;ome would reproach them with, &s;hould we return unto: It's a &s;ad con|&s;ideration, that there has been &s;o great, &s;inful and very grievous bandy|ing and beating about principles, That the Enemy, who loves to fi&s;h in troubled waters, has almo&s;t fi&s;hed away all, or at lea&s;t all our good and fir&s;t principles from us: And left us a drift in an un&s;ettled fluctuant po&s;ture, to our &s;hame and humiliation.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to principles, let me propound three things.</P>
<P N="1">1. Let our Principles be <HI>Scriptural.</HI> The Holy Scripture is that <HI>Gol|den Rule which we &s;hould mea&s;ure the Sanctuary with, Rev.</HI> 11. 1. <HI>Ezek.</HI> 40. 3. This is the true and only Standard of the Sanctuary; if this be not attended unto, all in the Sanctuary will be marred &amp; corrupted; <HI>Churches</HI> will be corrupted, <HI>Ordinances</HI> will be corrupted; and vi&s;ible Saints will be corrupted: <HI>Mini&s;ters</HI> they will not be as Gods mouth, as they ought to be, <HI>Jer.</HI> 15. 19. They will not be able to keep the charge of the holy things of God, and then he will be di&s;plea&s;ed with them as He was, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 44. 8, 9.&mdash;11. <HI>v.</HI> however they may be continued to be Mini&s;ters &s;till. There are no other mea&s;ures of men or Angels will quadrate with Gods Sanctuary, but only this Golden Rule. Mini&s;ters mu&s;t teach only what Je&s;us Chri&s;t has commanded them, <HI>Mat.</HI> 28. 20. <HI>Teaching them to ob&s;erve all things what&s;oever I command you.</HI>&mdash;And the Com|mands
<PB N="22" REF="001193_0024_0FB0FED4B6068548">
of Je&s;us Chri&s;t are in the Holy Scriptures, there|fore unto Scriptural Principles &s;hould we labour to bring them back.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">Mr. <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word"> Election Ser|mon.</HI></NOTE> A very able comprehen&s;ive head and holy heart, near thirty years ago, did in this Place lay down this Rule, and it is a good one. <Q>Let Truth be Truth how contrary &s;oever it be to any, to their apprehen&s;ions, intere&s;ts and inclinati|ons.</Q> Scripture Truth is Truth indeed.</P>
<P N="2">2. Let our principles be <HI>Rational,</HI> tho&s;e that are not Rational, are not Scriptural: here it holds true, <HI>Si collidimur frangimur.</HI> Principles &s;hould not be like Ropes of Sand, meer <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 word">, they &s;hould carry a certain de|mon&s;trativene&s;s of Rea&s;on with them, <HI>Tit.</HI> 1. 9. as the word there imports.</P>
<P N="3">3. Let Principles be as much as is po&s;&s;ible according to the <HI>Good Old way.</HI> It's true, we &s;hould not take principles on tru&s;t, or the Authori|ty of men; becau&s;e that the&s;e or tho&s;e men were &s;o opinionated: And it is as true, we &s;hould not reject them upon tru&s;t; not reject them, becau&s;e the&s;e and tho&s;e men di&s;like of, and are prejudiced a|gain&s;t them. To leave old Principles proved and approved by the mo&s;t Eminent Servants of God, and Societies of God's People, and by God him&s;elf, and take up with new ones in their &s;tead, is no better than &s;etting up of new Gods; <HI>Gods newly brought up, Deut.</HI> 32. 17. This was their &s;in; and if we do &s;o, it will be our &s;in and &s;hame: There|fore let us adhere, and bring back all to the good old Principles, which have been thus proved and approved; and walk in the way of good men, as the advice of Wi&s;dom, even of Je&s;us Chri&s;t is, <HI>Prov.</HI> 2. 20. And it was Chri&s;t's way to reduce things to what they were at the beginning, and &s;o to regulate them, &s;o in the ca&s;e of Mar|riage; and &s;o he directs them: <HI>Do the fir&s;t works, Rev.</HI> 2. 5. And tho&s;e that do indeed know the good of the fir&s;t, will adhere unto them, <HI>Luk.</HI> 5. 39. <HI>No man having drunk old wine, &s;traightway de&s;ireth new; for he &s;aith the old is better.</HI> And thus we &s;hould endeavour to bring back all to the fir&s;t Principles of our Fathers, and &s;o to their fir&s;t Ways.</P>
<P N="3">3. Let us endeavour not only to engage the <HI>Hearts</HI> of our People to us, but their <HI>Prayers</HI> for us It's a good thing for Mini&s;ters to have the hearts of their People; the Word of the Go&s;pel is more like to have its free cour&s;e, and run from the heart to the heart. But they &s;hould al&s;o endeavour to have their Prayers, and this will engage and di&s;po&s;e them to profit by them; this therefore is a mo&s;t de&s;irable, plea&s;ant and precious thing: <HI>As an ear-ring of gold, and an ornament of fine gold; &s;o is a wi&s;e reprover upon an obedient ear, Prov.</HI> 25. 12.</P>

The third branch of the <HI>EXHORTATION</HI> follows,</P>
<P><HI>III.</HI> The Exhortation &s;peaks to the People of <HI>All Sorts, Old</HI> and <HI>Young, High,</HI> and <HI>Low, Rich</HI> and <HI>Poor,</HI> in their &s;everal Stations; that they would very earne&s;tly endeavour and do their utmo&s;t, <HI>That the Ju&s;tice of God may not be further provoked again&s;t us.</HI> God is angry with us; his Ju&s;tice is offended; or el&s;e we mu&s;t &s;ay as the Enemy of God and his People &s;aith, <HI>That the Lord's Hand hath not done all this,</HI> Deut. 32. 27. For all that has come upon us is either from the Lord or it is &s;ome Chance that has happened unto us: Therefore let us not halt between two opinions. And if we do indeed acknowledge God; we have cau&s;e to &s;ay as <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 119. 120. <HI>My fle&s;h trembles for fear of thee, and I am afraid of thy Judgments.</HI> Therefore dont put more <HI>fuel</HI> into this devouring fire, nor oyl into this con&s;uming flame.</P>
<P>Here are three things to be attended.</P>
<P N="1">1. Take heed of and avoid <HI>Go&s;pel</HI> Sins. Where the Go&s;pel comes there are the greate&s;t Sins in the World; &s;uch Sins are more hainous than the Sins of <HI>Sodom, Matt.</HI> 11. 20&mdash;24. Go&s;pel neglecting, Go&s;pel re|fu&s;ing, and Go&s;pel de&s;pi&s;ing; Impenitence, Unbelief, hardne&s;s of Heart; Ignorance of, unthankfulne&s;s for, and barrenne&s;s under Je&s;us Chri&s;t in his Go&s;pel; loathing the Heavenly Manna; Lukewarmne&s;s, Hypocri&s;y, and taking up with a &s;hew and appearance in&s;tead of &s;ub&s;tance, <HI>Luk.</HI> 8. 18. And falling off from and for&s;aking Je&s;us Chri&s;t for this pre&s;ent evil World: The&s;e are Sins to be avoided, if we would not have God pro|voked yet more.</P>
<P N="2">2. Walk before God in your <HI>Hou&s;es</HI> in a perfect way. God has rai&s;ed us up Families like Flocks, and filled our Land with People; Families are Societies which nature in&s;titutes; and the <HI>Heads</HI> of them by a natu|ral right govern them; and <HI>Religious Heads</HI> &s;hould govern them for God. We &s;ay, that We and our Families are <HI>Abrahams</HI> Children, <HI>Abrahams</HI> Children are of the <HI>Faith of Abraham, Gal.</HI> 3. 6, 7, 9. And &s;hould do the works of <HI>Abraham, Jo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">.</HI> 8. 39, 40. Now <HI>Abraham commanded his Hou&s;e to Serve the Lord,</HI> Gen. 18. 19. If we would &s;hine as lights in an evil Gene|ration: if we would be of another Spirit, than the World are of, we mu&s;t do as <HI>Jo&s;hua</HI> did: Re&s;olve every one, <HI>As for me and mine Hou&s;e, We will Serve the Lord,</HI> Jo&s;h. 24. 15. Mend Families and mend all, ruin Families and ruin all. It is a &s;ad Omen to Con&s;ider how many of the mo&s;t no|ted Families in this Country are utterly extinct or wor&s;e: <HI>Fond Indul|gence</HI> and <HI>Remi&s;ne&s;s</HI> in Family Government de&s;troys Families: it brings <HI>Beliali&s;m</HI> into our Land, which does diffu&s;e it &s;elf abroad, and pa&s;&s;eth like oyl into our bones. And if <HI>Eli's</HI> Sins be found among us, we mu&s;t
<PB N="24" REF="001193_0026_0FB0FED8C4248FE8">
expect <HI>Eli's</HI> Judgments, and have had a &s;evere ta&s;te of them already: our Children have been brought forth for the Murderer; they have been numbred from year to year the&s;e many years to the Sword, to Fa|mine, to Captivity, to Sickne&s;s, to Shipwrack and to Death, by Scor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="2 letters"> and by hundreds of them.</P>
<P N="3">3. Be much in <HI>Prayer.</HI> Prayer is the very breath and vital Air of a Child of God, 'tis their gui&s;e to be much in Prayer, they are Spirited for it. There's the Spirit of Adoption, even the Spirit of Je&s;us Chri&s;t in them, <HI>Gal.</HI> 4. 6. And this Spirit helps them to Pray, <HI>Rom.</HI> 8. 26. And gives them boldne&s;s with God, <HI>Heb.</HI> 4. 16. Pray therefore for the <HI>Effu&s;i|ons of this Spirit:</HI> Pray for the Kingdom and Glory of the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t: Pray for the <HI>Churches</HI> that they may be kept <HI>Pure</HI> and <HI>Entire:</HI> Pray for the <HI>Children</HI> of the Lords People, that He would Circumci&s;e their Hearts to fear him, and that He would help his Servants aright, clearly to di&s;cern, and faithfully and &s;ucce&s;sfully to do their Duty to them; that they may not become a Generation of his Wrath: And this Prayer of Faith is the be&s;t way to prevent the encrea&s;e, and extin|gui&s;h the flames which are kindled upon us round about, by which we have been &s;et on Fire, and are &s;till burning: for this will engage the interce&s;&s;ion of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, which is the mo&s;t precious and acceptable incen&s;e of Atonement, <HI>Rev.</HI> 8. 3, 4.</P>
<P>To enforce this whole <HI>APPLICATION,</HI> there are the&s;e four Con|&s;iderations.</P>
<P N="1">1. It is a mo&s;t <HI>Ju&s;t</HI> and <HI>Righteous</HI> thing that we &s;hould do &s;o. That we &s;hould Seek <HI>Atonement</HI> through Je&s;us Chri&s;t; and that we &s;hould <HI>Ju&s;tify</HI> God, in all the Evils and Judgments of God again&s;t us; and that we &s;hould <HI>Lament</HI> and <HI>Amend</HI> our own Sins and Unrighteou&s;ne&s;s before the Lord, and endeavour all to do our utmo&s;t that this <HI>Offended Ju&s;tice</HI> of God may not be more provoked again&s;t us: The&s;e are Ju&s;t and Right things, &s;uch as we owe to our own Souls, to one another, and al&s;o to the Lord our God.</P>
<P N="2">2. This is the true&s;t accepting of the puni&s;hment of our Sins; when God puni&s;hes Sin, <HI>i. e.</HI> does inflict evil upon his People or Cha&s;ti&s;e them for their Sins: He expects they &s;hould be humble under his hand; <HI>Ex|alt him, ki&s;s the Rod, and lye in the du&s;t, if there be hope, Lam.</HI> 3. 29.&mdash;31. And this is one of his great ends which God aims at, and 'tis acceptable to him to &s;ee it attained; therefore when he &s;aw it in <HI>Ephraim, his bow|els were moved for him, Jer.</HI> 31. 18. And if this end be attained upon us, his bowels will yet be moved for <HI>New-England,</HI> and his repentings will be enkindled together. Of old time God has encouraged his People, that in this way they &s;hould hope for his gracious and effectual remem|bring
<PB N="25" REF="001193_0027_0FB0FED9C8861D18">
of them. <HI>If they confe&s;s their iniquity;</HI>&mdash;<HI>if then their uncircumci&s;ed heart be humbled, and they then accept the puni&s;hment of their iniquity: Then will I remember my Covenant with Jacob, and al&s;o my Covenant with I&s;aac, and al&s;o my Covenant with Abraham, will I remember, and I will remember the Land, Lev.</HI> 26. 40, 41, 42. God has been in <HI>Covenant</HI> with three Gene|rations in this Land; and if we now accept the puni&s;hment of our &s;ins, &s;urely he will remember his people, his Covenant and his Land.</P>
<P N="3">3. It is the mo&s;t proper and only cour&s;e to <HI>Cure</HI> all our Maladies. Our Maladies are great; the &s;ymptoms grievous, inveterate if not de&s;perate; <HI>the whole head is &s;ick, the whole heart is faint, I&s;a.</HI> 1. 5. And we have our healers, ble&s;&s;ed be God for it; <HI>I&s;a.</HI> 3. 7. But there's no method, there is no application will be &s;o effectual and &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful as this; it would cure our Moral and our Political, our Eccle&s;ia&s;tical and our Civil, our Per&s;onal and Publick Maladies; it would heal our guilt of Sin which makes &s;ick. <HI>The Inhabitants &s;hall not &s;ay I am &s;ick, for the people that dwell therein, &s;hall be forgiven their iniquity, I&s;a.</HI> 33. 24. It would heal our devi|ations and declen&s;ions, our murmurings, evil jealou&s;ies, our perver&s;e Spirits, di&s;tractions and all our breaches; and confirm our hopes and our faith.</P>
<P N="4">4. This will be the only way to extract <HI>Good</HI> out of all our <HI>Evils,</HI> ei|ther come or coming. Extracts are excellent noble Remedies; when the malignity of the evil is corrected, then it is reconciled, and the vir|tue of it may be enjoyed; our wor&s;t evils will be <HI>Salubrious,</HI> as far as 'tis po&s;&s;ible they &s;hould be. And all tho&s;e that will try the experiment, &s;hall at lea&s;t be &s;ure to &s;ave their own Souls.&mdash;<HI>They &s;hould deliver but their own Souls by their Righteou&s;ne&s;s, &s;aith the Lord, Ezek.</HI> 14. 14. And there is as much hope for the whole in this way as any: That yet there may come good out of evil to us; light out of darkne&s;s, and life out of death, at lea&s;t in the utmo&s;t i&s;&s;ue and event of them: That God will acknow|ledge us as he did the good figs; And <HI>though a basket of them &s;hould be carried into Babylon, it &s;hall be for their good;</HI>&mdash;<HI>becau&s;e he will &s;et his eyes up|on them for good.</HI>&mdash;<HI>And will give them an heart to know him, that he is the Lord, and they &s;hall be his people, and he will be their God, as Jer.</HI> 24. 5, 6, 7. Then he will ari&s;e for us, and render <HI>a reward to our neighbours, &s;even fold into their bo&s;om, their reproach wherewith they have reproached,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 79. 12. And we may ju&s;tly make the &s;ame conclu&s;ion which the man after Gods own heart did, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 41. 12, 13. As for us he will uphold us in our integrity, and &s;et us before his face for ever. <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed be the Lord God of I&s;rael, from Everla&s;ting to Everla&s;ting.</HI> Amen, <HI>and</HI> Amen.</P>
