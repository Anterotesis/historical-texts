<P>IN the&s;e words is contained a Motive given unto Believers to run with pa|tience the Race &s;et before them, not|with&s;tanding the &s;ore Trials they met with therein; as the lo&s;s of their Goods, Shame, and the contradiction of Sinners. <HI>Chap.</HI> 10. 33, 34. The Motive is taken from this con&s;ideration, that the Suf|ferings they met with were &s;mall, in compa|ri&s;on of tho&s;e which other Chri&s;tians had endured, and which they ought willingly to undergo, if God &s;hould call them thereto. In the&s;e words, (1.) Is implied, that in running the Race Chri&s;t hath &s;et before us, we are to re&s;i&s;t and &s;trive again&s;t Sin. Here we may note.</P>

By Sin in this Text, I incline to think, that we ought chiefly to under&s;tand, that which is the <HI>Prevailing Sin</HI> of the <HI>Age</HI> and <HI>Place</HI> in which each Believer doth live: For it is a non-compliance with, and an oppo&s;iti|on to the Prevailing Sins of the Time and Ge|neration wherein Believers have liv'd, that hath in all Ages occa&s;ioned the greate&s;t &s;uf|ferings unto good men, in their Names, E&s;tates or Lives: when Idolatry was the Sin which was mo&s;t in fa&s;hion in the world, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> holy men by re&s;i&s;ting and &s;triving again&s;t it, &s;uffered the lo&s;s of their lives.</P>

<P>Believers ought to &s;trive again&s;t the pre|vailing Sins of the Times, both &s;ingly and joyntly, and in all Conditions, Stations and Capacities wherein they &s;tand. Unto this Re&s;i&s;ting of Sin, Believers are moved, and hold them&s;elves obliged by &s;uch con&s;iderati|ons as the&s;e.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>That Sin is the Enemy of Mankind;</HI> their wor&s;t Enemy, their common Enemy; and in &s;ome &s;en&s;e their only Enemy. More particu|larly they con&s;ider,</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="6" REF="001348_0005_0FB2917DCD8457A8">
1. That <HI>each and every &s;ingle per&s;on</HI> hath no wor&s;e Enemy then his own &s;ins; &amp; among all the &s;ins which he falls into, or is &s;ubject of, his wor&s;t Enemy is that which is mo&s;t properly his <HI>own Iniquity.</HI> The Enemy within the walls of our hearts, is more dangerous than the Enemy be&s;ieging of us from with|out: Indeed we are by Nature un&s;en&s;ible that we carry our wor&s;t enemy in our own bo&s;oms, and &s;hall continue in&s;en&s;ible hereof, until God by the power and efficacy of his Spirit do convince us thereof: We are naturally much concerned about, and afraid of our &s;up|po&s;ed enemies without us; but ignorant of the danger we are in of the real enemy that lodgeth within us. The &s;ins prevailing in our hearts, as athei&s;tical &amp; profane thoughts, pride, worldly-mindedne&s;s, hypocri&s;ie, malice, and envy, and <HI>&s;imilia,</HI> do us more hurt, and expo&s;e us to more danger then all the enemies real or &s;uppo&s;ed that are without us. The Temptations of Satan, and the &s;nares of the World get victory over us, by rea&s;on of that enemy &s;in dwelling in us, which takes part with tho&s;e enemies from without us. The folly bound up in a mans own heart doth ex|po&s;e him to more danger, than all the policies of all other men can do, who &s;et them&s;elves again&s;t him.</P>
<P>Again; The &s;ins produced in per&s;ons by the principle of Corruption dwelling in them, whether they be &s;ins of omi&s;&s;ion or commi&s;&s;i|on, do hurt the Sinners them&s;elves more than they can hurt any one el&s;e be&s;ides them&s;elves, and more than any one el&s;e can hurt them. It is true not only of the man who is given
<PB N="7" REF="001348_0006_0FB2917EFB501118">
to exce&s;&s;ive drinking, but of the Adulterer, Thief, di&s;hone&s;t Gainer, the profane Swearer, Sabbath-breaker, and of him that omits the &s;ecret duties of Religion; &s;uch a man is his own wor&s;t enemy.</P>
<P>Sin &s;ets God him&s;elf again&s;t a man; now it were better for any man to have all the world adver&s;aries to him, then that One Great and Glorious God who made him, and who can ca&s;t both Body and Soul into Hell.</P>
<P>Sin expo&s;es a man to the Cur&s;es of the Law, to Death temporal, &s;piritual and eternal; and in &s;hort, nothing could or would hurt any man, were it not for Sin in him&s;elf, and the guilt of &s;in lying upon him&s;elf; a man &s;hould have no other enemy to conflict with, were it not for Sin adhering to, and inherent in him|&s;elf; in which re&s;pect Sin may be called Mans <HI>only</HI> enemy; and it is al&s;o his <HI>con&s;tant</HI> enemy, which at no time doth him any good, but at all times is procuring mi&s;chief &amp; mi&s;ery un|to him.</P>
<P>Therefore every man ought, and every Be|liever doth, and will re&s;i&s;t and &s;trive again&s;t his own &s;in, &s;in in him&s;elf; again&s;t the whole body of &s;in in him&s;elf, but chiefly again&s;t the leading, ruling, prevailing and mo&s;t predo|minant &s;in in him&s;elf; not only by exerci&s;ing repentance and godly &s;orrow for tho&s;e &s;ins that have prevailed in him, &amp; applying him|&s;elf by faith to the Blood of Chri&s;t for pardon|ing mercy &amp; deliverance from the guilt of &s;in; but by &s;etting upon the work of Mortification of &s;in dwelling in him with all his might; &amp; finding his own &s;trength (even that of grace received) to be of it &s;elf too weak to encoun|ter
<PB N="8" REF="001348_0007_0FB2918077FB7390">
with and &s;ubdue this enemy in his heart; he doth therefore by earne&s;t prayer call in, &amp; by the due exerci&s;e of faith obtain the help of Heaven again&s;t the mighty &s;ins that ri&s;e up again&s;t him.</P>
<P>A true Believer doth al&s;o re&s;i&s;t and &s;trive again&s;t &s;in in him&s;elf by maintaining a <HI>&s;trict watch</HI> over his heart, &amp; over his whole man, having learned not to tru&s;t his own deceitful heart.</P>
<P>He doth al&s;o daily renew the Combate a|gain&s;t Sin; confe&s;&s;ing unto God the faults &amp; follies which he di&s;cerneth in him&s;elf, and the daily eruptions of &s;in that dwelleth in him; complaining of him&s;elf unto God; <HI>O wretched man that I am! who &s;hall deliver me from this body of &s;in and death?</HI> and he maketh his complaint to the right object, the ble&s;&s;ed Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who came into this world to &s;ave his people from their &s;ins; unto him he is con&s;tantly crying, <HI>Je&s;us, thou Son of Da|vid, have mercy on</HI> me, and deliver me from this my wor&s;t Enemy, my &s;inful &s;elf.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Family Sins</HI> are the wor&s;t enemies of Fa|milies, and do bring all tho&s;e calamities and di&s;tre&s;&s;es upon them which befal them. Sin deprives Families of that comfort, for the at|taining whereof, the&s;e fir&s;t Societies that ever were erected in the world were appointed. All the Cro&s;&s;es, Lo&s;&s;es, Poverty, Sickne&s;&s;es, Deaths, Di&s;tractions and Di&s;orders that are in Families mu&s;t be placed to the account of &s;in. The rea&s;on why &s;ome Families flouri&s;h not in their Per&s;ons, E&s;tates, or Intere&s;ts, is not chiefly becau&s;e their Neighbours do not love them, but becau&s;e Sin (like the worm at the
<PB N="9" REF="001348_0008_0FB291848B434918">
root of <HI>Jonah's</HI> Gourd) makes them wither and decay. Where Family Prayer is neglect|ed, and God is not owned, honoured, wor|&s;hipped in a Family, no wonder that Family falls under a bla&s;t. If men re&s;olve to be rich without a&s;king God leave, without begging of God that his pre&s;ence may be with them in their employments, and his ble&s;&s;ing may be upon their lawful Endeavours, it is ju&s;t with God that &s;uch &s;hould be di&s;appointed. If the Head of the Family make no con&s;cience daily &amp; duly to perform Family Prayer, he may thank his own &s;inful omi&s;&s;ion of Duty that his Inferiours prove unto him undutiful, di&s;|obedient, unruly, and altogether di&s;comforts to him. Why &s;hould we expect that God &s;hould I provide for our Families their daily Bread, if we refu&s;e to pay to God (our great Landlord) his daily Rent and Revenue due unto him from us, namely the morning and evening Sacrifice of Prayer and Prai&s;es? Can we expect our Inferiours &s;hould &s;hew unto us Reverence and Obedience, while we our &s;elves are di&s;obedient to God, and undutiful to our Maker and Glorious Redeemer? How can we expect that the ble&s;&s;ed God by his preventing goodne&s;s &s;hould pre&s;erve us and ours from &s;ickne&s;&s;es, dangers and deaths, and take a fatherly care of us from day to day, while we refu&s;e to acknowledge him to be our Father, and the Father of our Families, by honouring and obeying of him? <HI>Mal.</HI> 1. 6.</P>
<P N="3">3. The Sins prevailing in greater Societies of men, (as Towns, Churches, Provinces, Kingdoms and Empires) are the wor&s;t Ene|mies of tho&s;e Societies or States. Whence
<PB N="10" REF="001348_0009_0FB2918901206038">
comes general <HI>Poverty,</HI> Scarcity, Deaths, un&s;ea&s;onable weather, Lo&s;&s;es by Land &amp; Sea? Whence comes <HI>War</HI> with all the calamities that are the appendices of it? Whence comes Epidemical Di&s;ea&s;es and mortal Di&s;tempers? only from Sin. Sin provokes God, &amp; then he rai&s;es up the Heathen and other Adver&s;aries again&s;t us. Our <HI>Barrenne&s;s</HI> under the means of Grace provokes God to &s;mite the Earth with barrenne&s;s, that it &s;hall not yield its en|crea&s;e unto us. We <HI>fall &s;hort</HI> of the duty that we owe unto God, therefore he cuts us &s;hort of our outward comforts: We delay &amp; pro|cra&s;tinate our repentance for Sin, and accep|tance of Chri&s;t offered to us in the Go&s;pel, therefore God delayes to hear our Prayers, &amp; to &s;ave us out of our di&s;tre&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>Sin is our <HI>Common</HI> Enemy; an Enemy to all our Communities and Societies; a <HI>publick and open</HI> Enemy to us, and an Enemy to the publick intere&s;ts of a People, as well as to the intere&s;ts of private men. Therefore we ought joyntly to re&s;i&s;t and &s;trive again&s;t Sin, by u|niting our forces and &s;trength again&s;t it; yea we &s;hould lay by our &s;maller differences a|mong our &s;elves, that with one con&s;ent and one heart we may defend our &s;elves again&s;t, and endeavour to &s;ubdue this common and implacable Enemy, which &s;eeks the de&s;tructi|on of us all. The people of God &s;hould re|&s;i&s;t and &s;trive again&s;t &s;in from a principle of <HI>Self-pre&s;ervation,</HI> and from <HI>Love</HI> to the Publick; becau&s;e &s;in re&s;i&s;ts and oppo&s;es all their good &amp; comfort, and tends to their ruin, mi&s;ery and de&s;truction.</P>
<P>To &s;uch an uniting of their forces again&s;t

&s;in, their common Enemy, True Believers are further excited by con&s;idering,</P>
<P N="2">2. That Sin <HI>is Gods Enemy</HI> as well as theirs. Now all that have &s;incerely given up their Souls to Chri&s;t, and expect Salvation by him, do take Chri&s;t's Friends to be their Friends, and Chri&s;t's Enemies to be their Enemies. A true Chri&s;tian is one that hath E&s;pou&s;ed the Intere&s;t of Chri&s;t to be his own Intere&s;t; yea, he prefers the Intere&s;ts of Chri&s;t his Re|deemer, before any other Intere&s;t that may be call'd his own: He hath &s;worn allegiance to Chri&s;t, and engaged him&s;elf to be his true &amp; faithful Subject, and Li&s;ted him&s;elf under Chri&s;t as his Captain General, to fight again&s;t all Chri&s;t's Enemies, &amp; to pro&s;ecute &amp; promote all the de&s;igns of Chri&s;t. Now the mo&s;t pre|vailing &s;ins of the Age and Place wherein he lives, are tho&s;e very Enemies of Chri&s;t which in a peculiar manner he accounts him&s;elf bound to re&s;i&s;t and &s;trive again&s;t; he that doth not mo&s;t vigorou&s;ly re&s;i&s;t tho&s;e &s;ins which are the prevailing &s;ins of the Time &amp; Generation wherein he lives, doth want one comfortable mark and character that might evidence the truth and &s;incerity of Grace in him. <HI>Eph.</HI> 5.8.11. A Chri&s;tian dare do no other then re&s;i&s;t and &s;trive again&s;t &s;in, both becau&s;e God (whom he &s;erves) hath obliged and <HI>commanded him</HI> &s;o to do; and becau&s;e he hath al&s;o deliberately and voluntarily <HI>bound and obliged</HI> him&s;elf by his Covenant with Chri&s;t to &s;trive again&s;t and re&s;i&s;t this grand Enemy of Chri&s;t. And all true Believers ha|ving one and the &s;ame&punc; living and true God to be their God; the &s;ame ble&s;&s;ed Lord Je&s;us
<PB N="12" REF="001348_0011_0FB2918D36879840">
Chre&s;t to be their 'aviour and Redeemer; therefore account them&s;elves bound, as they have opportunity in their &s;everal &s;tations, to joyn their forces together again&s;t &s;in, which is the great enemy of their common Lord &amp; Saviour; knowing that their Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t hates neutrality in this common cau&s;e, in this War we are to manage again&s;t Sin, the common Enemy of Chri&s;t him&s;elf as well as of our &s;elves.</P>
<P N="3">3. They con&s;ider, that <HI>the Sins of other men will hurt</HI> them, unle&s;s they do faithfully, as becomes them in their places, re&s;i&s;t and &s;trive again&s;t them. Believers &s;ee them&s;elves to be in danger of faring the wor&s;e for the &s;ins of other men; they &s;ee that they are expo&s;ed to &s;uffer in tho&s;e common Calamities which the prevailing &s;ins of the times bring on the Publick; and Good men know that the le&s;s oppo&s;ition they make to growing Vice and &s;in, the greater &s;hare they may expect in the publick Calamities, which the prevailing &s;ins of the Times bring down upon the World; and therefore Godly men can take no better cour&s;e to &s;ecure them&s;elves again&s;t publick &amp; de&s;troying Judgments, than con&s;tantly &amp; faithfully to re&s;i&s;t and &s;trive again&s;t tho&s;e prevailing &s;ins which procure the de&s;troying Judgments.

<P N="4">4. True Chri&s;tians are indued from Above with a Publick Spirit, which inclines them

to re&s;i&s;t and &s;trive again&s;t that which hin|ders the publick good, and brings publick Calamities on their People: They do not therefore content them&s;elves, to &s;eek only af|ter the &s;aving of their own Souls; but do what in them lieth to weaken the Kingdom of Darkne&s;s, by <HI>Converting</HI> others from their Evil ways; labouring that all per&s;ons, whom they are concerned with, and on whom they may have influence, <HI>be made &s;en&s;ible of the danger</HI> they are in of being drawn into a com|pliance with, and conformiry unto the pre|vailing Sins of the Times and Place wherein they live; giving them the <HI>be&s;t advice they can how to defend them&s;elves</HI> from that danger, by a right u&s;e of that Spiritual Armour which God hath provided for them.</P>
<P N="5">5.

<P>But I ha&s;ten to another Head: Namely,</P>
<P>Thirdly, To con&s;ider, in <HI>what manner</HI> Good men &s;hould re&s;i&s;t and &s;trive again&s;t growing Vice and Impiety. Now if we take the words of our Text to be an allu&s;ion to tho&s;e Conflicts and Combats among the Heathen in old Time; which were &s;eldom determi|ned without blood, and manag'd by expert Arti&s;ts, who Encountred each other in tho&s;e Conflicts before many Spectators; we may infer from this allu&s;ion the&s;e following direct|ions for a Chri&s;tian to ob&s;erve in his re&s;i&s;t|ing and &s;triving again&s;t growing Vice.</P>
<P N="1">1. That this &s;triving again&s;t &s;in is to be managed with <HI>Holy Affections:</HI> Particularly;</P>
<P N="1">(1.) <HI>With holy zeal, earnestne&s;s and fervour of &s;pirit, even with agony of &s;oul.</HI> A Chri&s;tian is not to act with faint heartedne&s;s and fear, when God calls him to lift up his Voice like a Trumpet again&s;t crying Sins; but to be,
<PB N="22" REF="001348_0021_0FB291A757F2A550">
when the ca&s;e &s;o requires, like a Lyon in God's Cau&s;e, tho' like a Lamb in his own Cau&s;e; knowing that Lukewarmne&s;s in this ca&s;e is as odious to God, as to &s;it &s;till and do nothing.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) <HI>With love and pity towards Sinners, and towards the Land, which by prevailing &s;ins are ripened for ruin, and expo&s;ed to destruction.</HI> A true Believer fore&s;eeing a Storm of Divine Wrath and Vengeance coming on a People, (which he can readily and rationally infer from the growth of Vice and Profane&s;s) from a compa&s;&s;ionate &s;pirit thru&s;ts him&s;elf into the Gap (opened for Judgments to enter in at) endeavouring by his Prayers, Tears, Warnings, Coun&s;els, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to keep off the Judgments which the Sins of a Land expo&s;e a people unto; and is &s;o much the more ear|ne&s;t and vigorous herein, as he &s;ees the day of wrath approaching and ha&s;tening towards them. <HI>Heb.</HI> 10. 25.</P>
<P N="2">2. This re&s;i&s;ting and &s;triving again&s;t &s;in is to be managed with <HI>holy di&s;cretion.</HI> As a Fencer &s;hews his Skill and Art as well as Courage; &s;o doth a Chri&s;tian Souldier in his conflicts with prevailing and growing vices. He knows that zeal without di&s;cretion is but wild fire, and di&s;&s;erves that good intere&s;t which he heartily de&s;ires to promote. His di&s;cretion teaches him, while he is vigorou&s;ly active again&s;t the Kingdom of Sin, carefully to avoid the &s;ins forbidden in the Second Ta|ble; namely, damnifying his Neighbour in his Honour and Reputation, in his E&s;tate or Life, or any of his lawful intere&s;ts.</P>
<P>Again, Di&s;cretion teaches him to ob&s;erve
<PB N="23" REF="001348_0022_0FB291A835E79368">
the <HI>Times</HI> and <HI>Sea&s;ons</HI> wherein he may &s;trike the greate&s;t blow again&s;t the Kingdom of Sin. <HI>A wi&s;e mans heart di&s;cerneth both time and judg|ment.</HI> There are times wherein Sinners are more capable of an in&s;truction or reproof for their Emendation, than they are at other times; &s;uch opportunity he waits for and improves to the be&s;t advantage. As for in|&s;tance, when a Sinner is under outward af|fliction, or inward di&s;tre&s;s of mind, at &s;uch a time will he endeavour to &s;peak a word in &s;ea&s;on that may put him upon it to con&s;ider his ways, to repent of his &s;ins, and to &s;et a|bout the reformation of his life. Thus Chri|&s;tians mu&s;t watch and wait for opportunities and &s;ea&s;ons when they may have ea&s;ie&s;t ac|ce&s;s into men, and redeem &s;uch times for the doing good to the &s;ouls of others.</P>
<P>Again, Di&s;cretion teaches him to wrap up his needful reproofs and hard arguments in &s;oft words, expre&s;&s;ive of his affection &amp; com|pa&s;&s;ion to the Sinner him&s;elf. If it be need|ful that any Sinner be laid under puni&s;hment by the Civil Law, or under Cen&s;ure in the Church for his reformation; yet tender|ne&s;s and meekne&s;s, grief and pity, expre&s;&s;ed towards him are mo&s;t likely to affect him with remor&s;e for his &s;ins committed, and re|&s;olution to avoid them for the future; while <HI>(e contra)</HI> Scoffs and Divi&s;ions do but tend to harden Sinners, and render them the more de&s;perately wicked.</P>
<P>Again, Di&s;cretion teaches him to avoid the danger of <HI>Sinful Indulgence,</HI> of winking and conniving at &s;in: the Judgments <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word"> on the Po&s;terity of <HI>Eli</HI> for his fault in that

<P>In all the&s;e &amp; &s;uch other like in&s;tances, he believes that &s;aying of <HI>Solomon</HI> to hold as a truth; <HI>Di&s;cretion &s;hall pre&s;erve thee,</HI> Prov. 2.11.</P>
<P N="3">3. Tho' in &s;ome places and times (thro' the great mercy of God) the Chri&s;tian Soul|dier is not expo&s;ed to &s;hed his Blood (in a proper &s;en&s;e) by his re&s;i&s;ting and &s;triving a|gain&s;t Sin, yet in &s;ome &s;en&s;e he may &s;ay with the Apo&s;tle, that <HI>he is in deaths often,</HI> 2 Cor. 11. 23. while he is managing this Combat; tho' he find the &s;trength of his body &amp; mind decaying, wa&s;ting and con&s;uming in the hot &s;ervice he is called unto, of oppo&s;ing Vice &amp; Prophane&s;s, yet per&s;everes therein, and is willing to &s;pend and be &s;pent in this Service again&s;t. Chri&s;t's Enemies, and re&s;olveth by Gods help to continue fighting the good fight, till Death in a proper &s;en&s;e, gives him a di&s;|charge from this War. Tho' he find that to be in good earne&s;t an oppo&s;er of &s;in &amp; vice is not the way to popular Applau&s;e, though he meet with &s;uch Tryals on that account, which are more bitter than death it &s;elf unto him; <HI>yet the righteous man holds on his way, &amp; grows stronger and &s;tronger (Job</HI> 17. 9.) in making re&s;i&s;tance to the growth of the Kingdom of Sin and Satan; the wounds he receiveth, make him fight with the greater courage and vigour; and &s;eeing his life mu&s;t be &s;pent in this Service, be re&s;olveth to do as much exe|cution as po&s;&s;ibly he can upon the Enemy, before Death overtakes him.</P>
<P N="4">4. As tho&s;e who &s;ought among the Heathen openly before many Spectators, may be &s;up|po&s;ed
<PB N="25" REF="001348_0024_0FB291AEA36D0010">
to fight in good earne&s;t, knowing the Blood of one of the Combatants mu&s;t be &s;pilt be|fore they left the Stage. So the Chri&s;tian Soul|dier in his &s;triving again&s;t Sin acts with inten&s;e|ne&s;s of mind, and <HI>integrity of heart.</HI> Chri&s;t hath in every Age, had &s;ome &s;incere Souldiers, who in the uprightne&s;s of their hearts have re&s;i&s;ted and &s;triven again&s;t &s;in.

<P>As there is as much danger of the Bani&s;hment of Learning by &s;ome that have a little &s;mattering of it, which only puffs them up to de&s;pi&s;e tho&s;e who excel them&s;elves therein, as there is from tho&s;e who are more ignorant; and as much dan|ger of the overthrow of the Civil State by &s;uch who (tho' they are acted only by &s;elf intere&s;t) have a little &s;mattering in the Law and in Poli|ticks, which only fills them with &s;elf conceited|ne&s;s, and cau&s;es them to de&s;pi&s;e and oppo&s;e tho&s;e who are thorow-paced in tho&s;e Sciences, and are indued with &s;incere love to the Publick Good&punc; So the work of Reformation is very much di&s;|&s;erved by the formal boa&s;ting and &s;elf-conceited Profe&s;&s;or, who&s;e knowledge only tends to puff him up, and makes him contemn and oppo&s;e whatever is contrived or acted tho' with inte|grity of heart by any other of his Fellow-Soul|diers in carrying on this Conflict again&s;t the King|dom of Sin.

1.

<P>What fal&s;e Reports and Mi&s;repre&s;entations are there made concerning the <HI>work</HI> of Reformation, the <HI>in&s;truments</HI> of it, and <HI>methods</HI> of it? True &s;e|rious Godline&s;s is mi&s;repre&s;ented to be an un|plea&s;ant and burden&s;ome life; and that there is not &s;uch need of re&s;training, curbing and &s;ubdu|ing the Kingdom of Sin as &s;ome preci&s;e per&s;ons imagine; what is acted by Good men with ut|mo&s;t caution, prudence, affection and moderation is repre&s;ented to be the effect of pride, cen&s;oriou&s;|ne&s;s and pragmaticalne&s;s.

How di|minutively will &s;ome &s;peak of reformation work, as if they &s;aw no beauty or glory therein?</P>
<P>And in&s;tead of moderating, qualifying and re|gulating the zeal of good men (which thro' the remainders of Corruption in them, &s;ometimes vents it &s;elf un&s;ea&s;onably or intemperately) men are too apt to u&s;e methods wholly to <HI>Extingui&s;h</HI> zeal again&s;t &s;in in them, &amp; to reduce them either to &s;uch a <HI>Lukewarm</HI> frame of &s;pirit as them&s;elves are in, or to &s;uch a <HI>Timerou&s;ne&s;s of Spirit,</HI> that they dare not expre&s;s their zeal again&s;t Vice any more; or &s;o to <HI>prejudice others again&s;t them,</HI> as that they &s;hall find them&s;elves thereby incapaci|tated from any further &s;ucce&s;sful attempts again&s;t the Kingdom of Sin.</P>

difficulties in their way; &s;o that there was no hope of making a Conque&s;t of the <HI>Canaanites,</HI> Deut. 1.28. <HI>Whither &s;hould we go up? our brethren have di&s;couraged our hearts, &s;aying, The people are greater and taller than we; the City is great and walled up to Heaven, and moreover we have &s;een the &s;ons of the Anakims there.</HI></P>
<P>In like manner, how apt are men to di&s;courage each other from any attempts again&s;t the weak|ning of the kingdom of &s;in, and putting a &s;top to the growth of profane&s;s? How many Lions are &s;uppo&s;ed to be in the way? One looks on it as a thing unattainable and impo&s;&s;ible to be effected; that the Go&s;pel in the Mini&s;try and Ordinances thereof &s;hould be &s;et up in &s;uch places where ig|norance, Errors &amp; Profane&s;s have had their king|dom. Another Good man is afraid that purging the Temple, or &s;weeping &s;ome dirt out of it by Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Cen&s;ures, will make the Temple it &s;elf fall down, or at lea&s;t &s;ome of the carved work of it.</P>
<P>But a Chri&s;tian Souldier &s;hould con&s;ider, that what is impo&s;&s;ible to be done by men or outward means in them&s;elves con&s;idered, may with the help, pre&s;ence &amp; a&s;&s;i&s;tance of God be accompli&s;h|ed; &s;o that in the way of dependance on God for his pre&s;ence and ble&s;&s;ing, according to the promi|&s;es made to us thereof, the Chri&s;tian Souldier may fall on and move forwards in the path of his du|ty, with &s;uch an encouraged &s;pirit as <HI>Paul</HI> had, Phil. 4. 13. <HI>I can do all things thro' Chri&s;t &s;trength|ning of me.</HI> He knoweth that when God is plea|&s;ed to <HI>work with</HI> mean &amp; weak in&s;truments, then wonders &s;hall be wrought, <HI>Mark</HI> 16. 20. <HI>Ezek.</HI> 20.44.</P>
<P N="3">3. Tho&s;e Spies di&s;couraged <HI>I&s;rael</HI> from going up again&s;t the <HI>Canaanites,</HI> by their own <HI>backward|ne&s;s;</HI> their bad example &s;et before their brethren, di&s;couraged them from their duty</P>

back, and draw off in this War again&s;t Vice and Profane&s;s, it di&s;animates others from falling on and pre&s;&s;ing forwards again&s;t this Enemy? <HI>Numb.</HI> 32. <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> knew that if the two tribes and half ab&s;ented them&s;elves, the Army of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> would not only be weakned as to <HI>number,</HI> but their <HI>Spi|rits &amp; Courage</HI> would be weakned al&s;o: therefore <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> placed them in the Front of the Army, to lead on the re&s;t in that Expedition. When Lea|ding men ab&s;ent them&s;elves, and will not afford their pre&s;ence and company to their brethren, nor contribute their advice to them how they &s;hould proceed in the affairs of Chri&s;t's Kingdom, and again&s;t the Kingdom of Sin, it is a very great di&s;couragement unto them.</P>
<P N="4">4. Tho&s;e Spies who di&s;couraged their brethren from going up again&s;t the <HI>Canaanites,</HI> were the <HI>majority in number.</HI> There were only <HI>Caleb</HI> and <HI>Jo&s;hua,</HI> who &s;tood on the Lord's &s;ide; the&s;e two were oppo&s;ed by the other ten; &s;o that the&s;e two were in imminent danger of being &s;to<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter">ed by the Mobile; who are &s;ometimes led more by number of voices, then by weight of arguments. The Kingdom of Sin and Vice is much upheld by plu|rality of voices, by noi&s;e and tumults. The Pha|ri&s;ees &s;et the multitude again&s;t Chri&s;t, to cry out, <HI>Let him be Crucified,</HI> which was all the an&s;wer <HI>Pilot</HI> could get to that pertinent que&s;tion, <HI>What hath he done?</HI> Mark 15. 14. It's a rare thing to hear of popular clamours again&s;t popular pre|vailing Vices and Profane&s;s, but not very rare to hear tumultuous noi&s;e again&s;t tho&s;e who &s;trive again&s;t, and re&s;i&s;t &s;in, whereby they are di&s;heart|ned, and ready to &s;ay, <HI>I will &s;peak no more in the name of the Lord;</HI> I will refrain my &s;elf even from that which is good, while &s;uch and &s;uch are before me.</P>
<P>Furthermore, As tho&s;e Spies were acted by &s;in|ful and carnal principles (&amp; <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> &s;u&s;pected the
<PB N="30" REF="001348_0029_0FB291BD784211B0">
two tribes and half whom he treats with, in <HI>Numb.</HI> 32. to be acting from like evil principles) &s;o from the &s;ame or like principles are men &s;till acted, who di&s;courage others from making a vi|gorous oppo&s;ition to the Kingdom of Sin in the world. Take a few in&s;tances.</P>
<P N="1">1. Tho&s;e Spies were overcome with carnal fear. <HI>Numb.</HI> 13. 21. <HI>We are not able to go up again&s;t this people, for they are &s;tronger than we; all the people we &s;aw in the land are men of great &s;tature, we were in their &s;ight as gra&s;hoppers, &amp;c.</HI> And being af|frighted them&s;elves, they became ready in&s;tru|ments to di&s;courage their brethren: So in the Spiritual War again&s;t the Kingdom of Sin, Cow|ardi&s;e doth great hurt. <HI>The fear of man is a &s;nare,</HI> Prov. 29.25. Hence it is that many become par|takers of other mens &s;ins, becau&s;e they are afraid to offend them by giving them a &s;ea&s;onable re|proof, or u&s;ing proper means to re&s;train &amp; reform them; and by &s;uch fearfulne&s;s and faint-heart|edne&s;s they di&s;courage others, who ju&s;tly expect that men of Eminency in Gifts, Offices, in Age, and in Grace, &s;hould be mo&s;t forward Witne&s;&s;es for Chri&s;t again&s;t growing vice.</P>
<P N="2">2. The ground of that fear in tho&s;e Spies was this; They lookt on the work before them with an eye of carnal &s;ence, &amp; not with an eye of faith. The unbelieving Spies could tell what they &s;aw with their bodily eyes; whereas believing <HI>Caleb</HI> &amp; <HI>Jo&s;hua</HI> did put their brethren in mind of God's promi&s;e. <HI>Numb.</HI> 14.9. that all tho&s;e people &s;hould be bread for <HI>I&s;rael, for their defence is departed from them, and the Lord is with us;</HI> and therefore exhorted their brethren not to fear them: The true rea&s;on why that Generation did not enter into the Land of Re&s;t, was becau&s;e of their un|belief, <HI>Heb.</HI> 4.6. The Victory which the Chri&s;tian Souldier hath over the &s;lavi&s;h fear of man is his faith: <HI>He that puts his tru&s;t in the Lord, &s;hall be
<PB N="31" REF="001348_0030_0FB291BEB6675A58">
&s;afe, Prov.</HI> 29. 25. When faith is weak, then the hands hang down and the knees grow feeble, &amp; men are unfit to do any great matter in this com|bate again&s;t &s;in; and very ready then to weaken the hands of others that would be active therein; whereas tho&s;e who have faith in due exerci&s;e in their own hearts will be &s;trengthning others in their Chri&s;tian Warfare, as <HI>Jonathan</HI> did <HI>David;</HI> he went into the wilderne&s;s to him, &amp; encoura|ged him, &amp; <HI>&s;trengthned his hand in God,</HI> 1Sa 23.16.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> &s;u&s;pected the two Tribes and half to be acted by a <HI>&s;lothful</HI> flame of &s;pirit: that they were loth to take the pains to make a further conque&s;t of <HI>Canaan,</HI> Numb. 32. that therefore they rather cho&s;e to content them&s;elves with le&s;s Land, being already conquered, than to undergo the difficulties of conquering more.</P>
<P>A &s;lothful frame of &s;pirit, and <HI>love of ea&s;e</HI> makes many &s;it &s;till and do nothing for the re|&s;training of Vice, and curbing of it; and &s;uch are apt to di&s;courage others from &s;uch attempts wherein they fore&s;ee dangers and difficulties, will encounter them.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> &s;u&s;pected the two Tribes and half that petitioned for the Land on this &s;ide <HI>Jordan</HI> for their Inheritance, to be acted by a <HI>covetous &amp; earthly mind;</HI> for that was &s;ome of the be&s;t Land in all <HI>Canaan</HI> which was then conquered, there|fore they made great ha&s;te to put in their Petiti|on for that Land; and tho' they purged them|&s;elves to <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> at this time, yet &s;ome think their hearts might be too much &s;et upon the Soil granted unto them, and that therefore they were of the fir&s;t that were afterwards carried into Captivity.</P>
<P>Many having obtained a good portion in this world, will not expo&s;e them&s;elves to any diffi|culty in re&s;i&s;ting the kingdom of &s;in, not trouble them&s;elves which of tho&s;e two Kingdom; pro&s;|per
<PB N="32" REF="001348_0031_0FB291C036964DE0">
mo&s;t in the world, whether the Kingdom of Heaven, or the Kingdom of Sin. Such who&s;e Hearts are &s;et on Earthly things, have been wont to make great oppo&s;ition to the progre&s;s of the Go&s;pel. <HI>Acts</HI> 19. 24, 29. So tho&s;e that love the world better than they love their Souls, are content to live without a Go&s;pel Mini&s;try and means of Grace, on this account, becau&s;e they think it will &s;ave charges.</P>
<P N="5">5. Po&s;&s;ibly <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> might &s;u&s;pect tho&s;e two Tribes and half to act from a principle of direct <HI>Rebellion</HI> again&s;t the po&s;itive Command of God. <HI>Numb.</HI> 32. 10. <HI>Thus did your Fore-fathers,</HI> faith <HI>Mo|&s;es:</HI> Now their Fore-fathers were guilty of plain rebellion again&s;t God. <HI>Numb.</HI> 14. 4. 9. <HI>Only rebel not ye again&s;t the Lord. Mo&s;es</HI> &s;u&s;pected the &s;ame rebellious frame of &s;pirit to be in them he now treated with, which mightly hid under the cloak of their fair and &s;pecious pretences; He was a|fraid left there lay rooted in their hearts a prin|ciple of prevailing Enmity again&s;t God's po&s;itive Commands.</P>
<P>This is one chief cau&s;e why men di&s;courage one another from vigorous e&s;&s;ays and attempts to batter down the kingdom of &s;in, becau&s;e there is in their hearts a &s;ecret enmity again&s;t Religion in the power of it, and again&s;t the ways of Ho|line&s;s, and a &s;ecret love to the ways and works of darkne&s;s; when &s;uch enmity appears in the vi&s;ible &amp; vile&s;t expre&s;&s;ions and effects of it, it de|&s;erves &s;uch treatment as <HI>Paul</HI> gave to <HI>Elymas,</HI> Acts 13. 8, 10. But where if lies hid and latent, we had need take pains to examine our hearts &amp; find it out and mortify it; for doubtle&s;s we have more &s;in lurking in our hearts than we our &s;elves are apt to be aware of.</P>
<P>Let us examine our &s;elves, how far each of us have been guilty of di&s;couraging others from u|&s;ing their be&s;t endeavours to &s;uppre&s;s Vice, and
<PB N="33" REF="001348_0032_0FB291C1B4B8A4A0">
to re&s;train Immorality and Profane&s;s, Let's mourn for our own &s;lothfulne&s;s, backwardne&s;s, unbelief and earthly-mindedne&s;s, and the &s;ecret enmity in our hearts again&s;t &s;erious Religion. Let us fear and tremble le&s;t we &s;hould be any way guilty for time to come of di&s;couraging o|thers from a vigorous di&s;charge of their duty: Let's think of that awful word which <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> adds, <HI>Numb.</HI> 32. 15. <HI>And ye &s;hall de&s;troy all this people. One Sinner de&s;troys much good,</HI> Eccl. 9. 18. A few per&s;ons who di&s;courage others from walk|ing in ways of Obedience to God's Commands, may be ju&s;tly charged by God as the authors of the ruin and de&s;truction of the whole Generati|on, whereof they them&s;elves are a part. Tho' that whole Generation that were di&s;couraged by tho&s;e ten Spies were them&s;elves de&s;troyed in the Wilderne&s;s, <HI>Numb.</HI> 32. 13. yet the ten Spies were made the peculiar Monuments of Divine Venge|ance: So were <HI>Korah</HI> and his Company, who led the Congregation into rebellion again&s;t God. <HI>Numb.</HI> 16. So the Sons of <HI>Eli,</HI> that were wicked, and were in&s;truments of leading others into &s;in, and cau&s;ing the ways of God's Wor&s;hip to be abhorred, they were remarkably puni&s;hed by the Lord. Let us fear then le&s;t this Indictment &s;hould be drawn up again&s;t us; ye have de&s;troyed all this people by di&s;couraging them from a thorow &s;erious and effectual oppo&s;ition to the Kingdom of Sin.</P>
<P>I &s;hall conclude with a very few words to the Honourable GENTLEMEN of the ARTILLE|RY COMPANY, who obliged me to appear be|fore them this day.</P>
<P>I doubt not of their Ingenuity to accept of this di&s;cour&s;e, as not wholly di&s;agreeable to the pre|&s;ent Occa&s;ion; &s;eeing they have been accu&s;tom'd to have a Religious Improvement made of the Military Art and Terms on &s;uch Opportunities
