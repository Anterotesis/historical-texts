<Q><HI>Where the Word of a King is, there is Power; and who may &s;ay unto him what doe&s;t thou?</HI></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>LEST it &s;hould be thought, by any of this a&s;&s;embly, that the preacher has &s;tumbled at the thre&s;hold in chu&s;|ing a text contrary to the genius of our pre&s;ent con&s;titution, it may not be ami&s;s to ob&s;erve, that according to the language of &s;cripture, the word king &s;ignifies any kind of governor, or the ruling power of any &s;tate. Accordingly Mo&s;es is called king in the 33d chapter of Deuteronomy; the
<PB N="6" REF="017450_0005_0FA11E9C31AE8180">
Judges have the &s;ame appellation, Judges xvii; to the four great Monarchies, the government of &s;ome of which was demo|cratic, <ABBR>viz.</ABBR> <HI>Greece</HI> and <HI>Rome,</HI> the &s;ame title is given; and in the new te&s;tament, the &s;even kings, mentioned Rev. xvii. 10, are, by &s;ome of the late&s;t and be&s;t expo&s;i|tors, under&s;tood of &s;even particular empe|rors of <HI>Rome.</HI> So that by king in the text, without putting any force upon the words, may be under&s;tood the ruling power of any nation, be it called in modern language by what name &s;oever. Were this not the truth of fact, it would be nece&s;&s;ary for us, as we have changed our form of govern|ment, to omit a con&s;iderable part of the &s;cripture as inapplicable to our condition. But interpreted in the manner above &s;ug|ge&s;ted, tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ages are as proper to be u&s;ed by us, as by any people under heaven. The truth of the ca&s;e &s;eems to be this. At the time the text was penned, kingly rule was the mo&s;t prevalent. Tho&s;e who were called by this name, were ve&s;ted with different degrees of power. <HI>Some</HI> governed by &s;tanding laws; and <HI>others</HI> conducted the great affairs of &s;tates and kingdoms ac|cording to their own arbitrary plea&s;ure. Among&s;t the Jews, the king was only the
<PB N="7" REF="017450_0006_0FA11E9E1E8BE2A0">
&s;upreme executive magi&s;trate. He had little or nothing to do with matters of legi&s;lation. Their code of laws was pre|viou&s;ly &s;ettled by God him&s;elf, and given to Mo&s;es for the rule of their conduct, in all the &s;ub&s;equent &s;tages of their political exi&s;tence. In the times of the <HI>Judges</HI> the admini&s;tration of their government was in the hands of God; and hence by the learned it is frequently called a <HI>theocracy:</HI> But the Jews, tired with having Jehovah for their &s;upreme ruler, and perceiving that the nations around them had a mortal man to &s;tand in this place, de&s;ired, as is too common at the pre&s;ent day, to be in the fa&s;hion, and to have a king like others. The reque&s;t, as being to their own di&s;ad|vantage, was di&s;plea&s;ing to the God of heaven. But, as he would not rule them in a manner contrary to their own incli|nation, he con&s;ented to their petition, after pointing out to them the oppre&s;&s;ive manner of the king. Their kings for &s;everal ge|nerations ruled in righteou&s;ne&s;s, and made the in&s;titutes of Mo&s;es the mea&s;ure of their admini&s;tration. Concerning &s;uch, Solomon pronounces as in our text, <HI>where the word of a king is, there is power.</HI> Whil&s;t they keep within con&s;titutional
<PB N="8" REF="017450_0007_0FA11E9E73F95BE0">
limits they cannot be re&s;i&s;ted with impu|nity. Di&s;obedience to &s;uch, expo&s;es both to temporal and eternal puni&s;hments. To temporal; as the king is ve&s;ted with great authority, and may do whatever he plea&s;es for the pre&s;ervation of order and the ad|vancement of the public happine&s;s: To eternal al&s;o; as government is of divine in&s;titution; and it is the will of heaven that we &s;hould obey not only for <HI>wrath,</HI> but al&s;o for <HI>con&s;cience &s;ake,</HI> provided the ruling power <HI>be the mini&s;ter of God for good.</HI></P>
<P>There is no nece&s;&s;ity of &s;uppo&s;ing the declaration of Solomon true only of kingly government, properly &s;o called. It is, or ought to be true of all kinds of govern|ment; and if there be <HI>any</HI> concerning which the a&s;&s;ertion of the wi&s;e man may not, with truth, be made, it is evidently defective, and ought immediately to be amended, or totally changed. Three dif|ferent modes of civil rule have been pre|valent among the nations of the earth, a <HI>monarchy, ari&s;tocracy,</HI> and <HI>democracy;</HI> and indeed <HI>&s;ome</HI> have a combination or mixture of all three, as England. This has been e&s;teemed by enlightened foreigners to be
<PB N="9" REF="017450_0008_0FA11E9F32601670">
the happie&s;t of any other, and infinite en|comiums have been pa&s;&s;ed upon it. Under &s;uch a form the people were free for many centuries. Corruption has at length taken place, and deprived the community at large of many of the ble&s;&s;ings which they for|merly enjoyed.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There was formerly a proper balance of power between the three con&s;tituent branches of the Briti&s;h con&s;titution; and at that time it was a noble one. It had the &s;trength and di&s;patch of Monarchy; the dignity and wi&s;dom of Ari&s;tocracy, and the freedom of Democracy all combined in one. But this happy equipoi&s;e of power was de&s;troyed, when the Commons granted to the king certain duties and cu&s;toms, in lieu of per|&s;onal &s;ervice due to the Lord paramount, by the feudal &s;y&s;tem, together with the di&s;po&s;al of all the lucrative places that became nece&s;&s;ary for the collection of tho&s;e cu&s;toms. This gave the king an undue in|fluence, and enabled him to carry any point in Parlia|ment. He is now vertually, though not nominally, an ab&s;olute monarch; e&s;pecially as the people are very venal and corrupt. Innovations in government are dangerous.</NOTE> Hence we learn that &s;omething el&s;e is nece&s;&s;ary towards making a people free and happy, be&s;ides a good con&s;titution.</P>
<P>Amid&s;t the different forms, it has often been enquired, which is the be&s;t? To &s;uch a que&s;tion it may truly be an&s;wered, that no <HI>particular one</HI> is &s;uitable for all people; nor <HI>any one</HI> for the <HI>&s;ame people always.</HI>
<PB N="10" REF="017450_0009_0FA11E9FF2C49CD0">
As the tempers and manners of nations change, a change in their government be|comes nece&s;&s;ary. The Jews, at fir&s;t, lived under a free commonwealth. Advancing in vice, they cho&s;e a different one; and being indulged, they de&s;cended at la&s;t, namely, before their Babyloni&s;h captivity, to a mode of civil rule, &s;imilar to that of the ea&s;tern nations, at the pre&s;ent day, where one man, by birth or conque&s;t, takes the &s;ole command, and rules according to his de&s;potic will.&mdash;The Romans under|went many changes in this regard. Formed at fir&s;t of a &s;et of outlaws and in&s;olvent debtors, they in&s;tituted kingly rule. This continued for a few generations, till their kings, intoxicated with power, broke over all whole&s;ome re&s;traints, and com|mitted <HI>per&s;onally,</HI> and by their <HI>&s;ons,</HI> crimes intolerable to a free and virtuous people. <HI>Brutus,</HI> teaching the evil of a certain ne|fandous deed, and &s;econded by his worthy citizens, bani&s;hed the royal family from Rome. After this, they &s;et up a govern|ment of the popular kind, under which they enjoyed their liberties in great per|fection, till falling under the burden of their own vices, and de&s;cending to a thou|&s;and factions, <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar,</HI> at the head of
<PB N="11" REF="017450_0010_0FA11EA0B33851E8">
a well-di&s;ciplined body of troops, taking the advantage of this di&s;tracted &s;tate of the republic, retired from <HI>Gaul,</HI> and thunder|ing with his legions at the gates of <HI>Rome,</HI> &s;truck terror into the inhabitants, and fight|ing a battle with <HI>Pompey,</HI> one of a wicked triumvirate, obtained a complete victory over him, and was, in con&s;equence, de|clared by the &s;enate perpetual Dictator, a title &s;imilar to that of ab&s;olute Monarch. Now, it may well be que&s;tioned, whether <HI>this,</HI> for that people, under their pre&s;ent temper, was not the be&s;t government they could po&s;&s;ibly have. <HI>Holland</HI> was once governed by a monarch who bid defiance to all former laws. They groaned under his juri&s;diction; they refu&s;ed his edicts; and, though they &s;uffered much, they, at la&s;t, obtained a compleat independency, and remain to this day free in <HI>con&s;titution,</HI> though &s;ome have pretended to affirm that they are &s;laves in <HI>reality.</HI></P>
<P>From this view of the matter, it is ap|parent, that the character of a people is to be taken into account, in order to pro|nounce what mode of civil policy is be&s;t for them. This may, on the whole, be affirmed, that no people can be &s;aid to
<PB N="12" REF="017450_0011_0FA11EA173C789F8">
enjoy freedom, who have not the choice of their rulers, either <HI>mediately</HI> or <HI>imme|diately,</HI> in their own power. A different doctrine, I am &s;en&s;ible, has frequently been preached. <HI>Time-&s;erving prie&s;ts</HI> and <HI>fawning &s;ycophants</HI> have &s;ometimes flat|tered kings that they enjoyed their places <HI>jure divino;</HI> and &s;cripture has been quoted in defence of the ab&s;urd tenet. Thus St. Paul has been &s;uppo&s;ed to patronize the doctrine, when he tells us, <HI>that the powers which be are ordained of God.</HI> But as this cannot intend that rulers are elevated to their places by the immediate agency of heaven; &s;o neither does it mean that <HI>Peter, Richard, John, Charles, Henry</HI> or <HI>George</HI> are particularly de&s;ignated to office. From <HI>that pa&s;&s;age</HI> we learn <HI>only,</HI> that government is of divine appointment, and that rulers have no other qualifications for their places, but what God, in the cour&s;e of his providence, has given them. King Solomon has been produced as an advocate for the doctrine of pa&s;&s;ive obe|dience and non-re&s;i&s;tance, the divine he|reditary right of rulers. My text has been quoted in &s;upport of this opinion by men, from who&s;e genius and learning we might have expected more &s;ober and
<PB N="13" REF="017450_0012_0FA11EA2345C1D20">
rational &s;entiments. But, is it po&s;&s;ible that a book written by divine guidance &s;hould teach the doctrine of unre&s;erved obedience! The &s;econd ver&s;e of my con|text plainly demon&s;trates the contrary. Hear what the wi&s;e man &s;ays; <HI>I coun&s;el thee to keep the king's commandment, and that in regard of the oath of God.</HI> Now, can we &s;uppo&s;e it is the plea&s;ure of hea|ven that we &s;hould obey the unrighteous and oppre&s;&s;ive commands of tho&s;e in power, and <HI>that,</HI> not merely for <HI>wrath,</HI> but <HI>for con&s;cience &s;ake.</HI> What! Does the command of heaven make it nece&s;&s;ary that we &s;hould take an oath of fealty and allegiance to all kinds of authority; and that, by virtue of it, we are obliged to obey even tho&s;e magi&s;trates who com|mand us to practi&s;e idolatry, or any other evil work? The ca&s;e is too evident to need many words. All that Solomon, therefore, meant was, that it is impious and dangerous to re&s;i&s;t the authority of tho&s;e who rule for God, and con&s;ult the common good.</P>
<P>My following di&s;cour&s;e will be to &s;hew how the &s;upreme authority of any &s;tate &s;hould be appointed and conduct, in order
<PB N="14" REF="017450_0013_0FA11EA2F27A7470">
to its coming with power in its &s;everal edicts and commands; and then, &s;econdly, &s;how what is the proper application of this power.</P>
<P>1&s;t. The ruling power of every &s;tate or kingdom &s;hould be elected by the body of the people. As no man is born a ruler, &s;o there is no po&s;&s;ible way for him to get regularly into office, but by the election of his fellow-citizens. Dominion by <HI>con|que&s;t,</HI> by <HI>artifice,</HI> by <HI>&s;aint&s;hip,</HI> or <HI>grace,</HI> is ju&s;tly to be reprobated. It is our duty to re&s;i&s;t &s;uch u&s;urpers whenever we are able. Under God, the original &s;ource of all power, mankind enjoy, or ought to do &s;o, the liberty of governing them&s;elves. The powers of government are ve&s;ted in the body of the people, and they may exerci&s;e them as they plea&s;e, either per|&s;onally or by repre&s;entatives. Their local &s;ituation and numbers make it inconve|nient to do the former; hence the latter mode u&s;ually prevails.</P>
<P>Government by deputation does not con&s;i&s;t with that plenitude of liberty in the people that they might enjoy, could they give their &s;uffrages per&s;onally. How|ever,
<PB N="15" REF="017450_0014_0FA11EA3D4CCFB50">
when our repre&s;entatives are regu|larly cho&s;en, are amenable to our tribu|nals, and their election is not of long duration, then we may be &s;aid to be as free as the &s;tate of the world will com|monly admit. To be deprived of the power of chu&s;ing our rulers, is to be deprived of &s;elf dominion. If <HI>they</HI> are appointed over us, by tho&s;e over whom we have no controul, we are in a &s;tate of &s;lavery. There is no difference, in this re&s;pect, between &s;uch a people, and the hor&s;es they ride on; neither are govern|ed by their own will, in which the e&s;&s;ence of all freedom con&s;i&s;ts. Indeed, it is generally allowed at the pre&s;ent day, by men of the fir&s;t character, that the choice of the people is the only &s;ource of power; and that <HI>republican government looks be&s;t on paper,</HI> but that it is not &s;ufficiently energetic and deci&s;ive to an|&s;wer the nece&s;&s;ities of the &s;tate. There has been, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, too much rea&s;on for the above ob&s;ervation. Very popular governments have &s;ometimes been found too weak to prevent tumults, in&s;ur|rections and factions. A wi&s;e people, therefore, in the organization and e&s;tab|li&s;hment of a con&s;titution, will take all po&s;&s;ible care to guard again&s;t &s;uch a defect.
<PB N="16" REF="017450_0015_0FA11EA593984FC8">
But how &s;hall this be done? Shall they recur to the long &s;ince exploded doctrine of the divine right of rulers; and labor to po&s;&s;e&s;s the body of the people with an opinion that damnation will be the inevita|ble con&s;equence of oppo&s;ing tyrants? Shall they give up the claim of election, and a&s;&s;ert that magi&s;trates are &s;ent immediately from heaven, and govern independently of them? <HI>This would be &s;peaking wickedly for God.</HI> There is no nece&s;&s;ity of recur|ring to any &s;uch paltry expedients. To give energy to governments erected with our own hands, nothing more is nece&s;&s;ary than a union of all the mo&s;t enlightened and virtuous people in &s;upport of them. And if our elections are made in wi&s;dom, if we <HI>choo&s;e out able men, who fear God and hate covetou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> then among &s;uch a people, obedience will be chearful and prompt. All laws bind by con&s;ent. The majority <HI>can,</HI> and <HI>does always govern.</HI> It is their con&s;ent and concurrence; their coun|tenance and &s;upport that give energy and power; and in order to obtain this, no|thing more is nece&s;&s;ary, than to have the whole government admini&s;tered for the public good. This makes it the intere&s;t of the people in general to obey. Individuals
<PB N="17" REF="017450_0016_0FA11EA5F2F34A08">
having a different intere&s;t may be di&s;po&s;ed to re&s;i&s;t and even to call others into their vortex; but their feeble efforts may be ea&s;ily overcome by the contrary exertions of the more numerous, the more virtuous and more rational part of their fellow citizens.</P>
<P>Republican governments are &s;aid not only to be de&s;titute of energy, but to be <HI>&s;low</HI> and <HI>unperforming.</HI> This defect may be removed by allowing &s;uch prerogatives to a <HI>&s;ingle per&s;on</HI> as are nece&s;&s;ary to the vigor and di&s;patch of public mea&s;ures. However, in large a&s;&s;emblies, where there is a diver&s;ity of intere&s;ts and opinions, matters of importance will never be &s;peedi|ly di&s;cu&s;&s;ed. This is an inconvenience to which we mu&s;t &s;ubmit, and it is the price we pay for our liberties. It ought to be remembred there is <HI>&s;afety,</HI> tho' there is <HI>expence</HI> in the&s;e &s;low and tedious di&s;cu&s;&s;i|ons; and if we allow it a defect, we cer|tainly can find no form of government, but what is chargeable with as great or greater.</P>
<P>In all free &s;tates the people have a right, not only to &s;ay who &s;hall be their rulers, but al&s;o by what <HI>tenure</HI> they &s;hall hold their offices, and the <HI>&s;teps</HI> by which they &s;hall arrive at them.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="017450_0017_0FA11EA6B3ABC0B0">
In order to avoid the feuds and factions that the election of a chief magi&s;trate would occa&s;ion in &s;ome large nations, the con&s;titution provides, that certain families &s;hould rule by hereditary right. Though this e&s;tabli&s;hment avoids &s;ome, it is expo|&s;ed perhaps to greater inconveniences. By means hereof, they may oftentimes have for their fir&s;t ruler, tho' not a com|pleat idiot, yet perhaps one &s;eparated therefrom, only by a thin partition. Further, when children are born heirs apparent to &s;ome high and important &s;ta|tion in government, their education is commonly &s;uch, as to fill them with ideas of &s;uperiority, unfriendly to the rights of mankind. To govern well, with ju&s;tice, clemency and mercy, we ought to be acquainted with human nature in the lowe&s;t walks of life.</P>
<P>In elective kingdoms, the election for the mo&s;t part, is either for life or for a con&s;iderable number of years. The bet|ter way is to chu&s;e our rulers frequently. The term ought to be known and a&s;cer|tained; at the expiration of which we may omit them if we plea&s;e. This is true if they conduct ever &s;o well; and there is great rea&s;on for it, if they have been
<PB N="19" REF="017450_0018_0FA11EA772AD9E18">
guilty of mal-admini&s;tration. But tho' frequent elections may be proper, yet it mu&s;t be highly imprudent, frequently to change tho&s;e who are qualified for their tru&s;t and di&s;po&s;ed to do the duties of it. This ob&s;ervation is true of any officer, but more e&s;pecially of tho&s;e who are high in command. There may be rea&s;ons for electing the chief magi&s;trate annually; but if a new per&s;on is yearly cho&s;en, it will le&s;&s;en the influence of authority, weaken the &s;inews of government, crumble the peo|ple into parties, and e&s;tabli&s;h habits incon|&s;i&s;tent with that &s;pirit of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion which is highly nece&s;&s;ary to the good of &s;ociety. A <HI>monopoly</HI> of office &s;hould never be per|mitted; a <HI>rotation</HI> indeed excludes it; and changes at proper intervals, excite people to a laudable application to bu&s;ine&s;s and books, that they may become qualified for po&s;ts of eminence and di&s;tinction. But on the contrary, if the man who holds the fir&s;t place in the government, knows that he &s;hall enjoy it but a &s;hort &s;pace, let his deportment be ever &s;o unexcep|tionable, he will hardly be warm in his office, get but a mi&s;erable acquaintance with his duty, acquire no facility in the performance of it, and lo&s;e a grand <HI>&s;timu|lus</HI> to excel. Unle&s;s therefore we were
<PB N="20" REF="017450_0019_0FA11EA834D13998">
born <HI>governors, legi&s;lators,</HI> &amp;c. it mu&s;t be wi&s;e in a people to elect their principal officers for a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of years, provided they an&s;wer the end of their elevation. In this way, we &s;hall &s;ecure to our|&s;elves more of the beneficial influences of government, than it is po&s;&s;ible for us in the contrary practice.</P>
<P>As the choice of the people is the only rational &s;ource of power, &s;o it makes obe|dience the mo&s;t rational act. <HI>Slaves</HI> fear the rod, but <HI>freemen</HI> are kept in the line of duty by more ingenuous principles. That &s;ociety who will not be governed but by brutal force, is unworthy any de|gree of freedom, and will not long enjoy it. If we will not govern our&s;elves, we mu&s;t be ruled by tho&s;e over whom we have no controul.</P>
<P>The nation of America is remote from &s;uch a calamitous event. The whole &s;eries of our conduct, the unexampled patience with which we have waded thro' a &s;ea of trouble, in order to gain the pre|&s;ent &s;eparate and independent &s;tation among the nations of the earth; the blood we have chearfully &s;pilt in this unhappy con|te&s;t, and the pre&s;ent determined &s;pirit of
<PB N="21" REF="017450_0020_0FA11EA8F2E6F9B0">

But it is not to every kind of injunction they will readily &s;ubmit. Several things are nece&s;&s;ary to procure chearful obedience to laws, be&s;ides their being enacted by men in our own election. Particularly, fir&s;t, they &s;hould be agreeable to the <HI>genius</HI> of the people, and the <HI>&s;pirit</HI> of the <HI>con&s;tituti|on.</HI> The <HI>con&s;titution</HI> contains the funda|mental principles of the &s;tate in which we live. It is the <HI>civil compact,</HI> and points out the manner in which we chu&s;e to be governed, the <HI>privileges</HI> of the people, and the <HI>prerogatives</HI> of the governing body. The&s;e powers are ceded to others, not for the &s;ake of aggrandizing any cla&s;s of men; not for the purpo&s;e of keeping up a vain di&s;tinction among tho&s;e who by nature are equal; not that <HI>&s;ome</HI> may <HI>riot</HI> in <HI>plenty,</HI> whil&s;t <HI>others</HI> are indigent and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed; but only that they may u&s;e them for the pub|lic good. As the rivers empty their wa|ters into the &s;ea, that common receptacle, in order to receive them again, that their &s;ources may not be dried up, that they may

The poor man's authority as well as wi&s;dom is de&s;pi&s;ed. Wealth gives influence. A &s;plendid exterior does much towards com|manding re&s;pect.

our own election, who are natives of the country, there is no fear of this. The probability rather is, that they will &s;pend their own inheritance, in order to keep up the dignity of the government.</P>
<P>The <HI>legi&s;lative</HI> body is &s;uperior in pow|er to the <HI>executive.</HI> They hold the reins of government in their hands; but as in <HI>this,</HI> and all free countries, they con&s;titute a numerous a&s;&s;embly, it is not to be expect|ed&punc; that at the public expence, each individu|al &s;hould be &s;upported in affluence. They ought however, certainly to be &s;upported. Many of their <HI>High Mightine&s;&s;es,</HI> the members of the <HI>States General,</HI> make no great per&s;onal appearance; the &s;plendor of maje&s;ty re&s;ides in the <HI>Stadtholder.</HI> But tho' the individuals who compo&s;e this body, may not all of them be per&s;onally very re&s;pectable, yet as a part of one great whole, they are, when acting con&s;tituti|onally, an a&s;&s;embly with whom re&s;ides a power, which no &s;eparate parties may re&s;i&s;t. But if this a&s;&s;embly &s;tretch their prerogatives beyond con&s;titutional bounds, they may lawfully be oppo&s;ed. Power is extremely apt to dilate, or &s;pread it&s;elf abroad. Hence there is need of vigilan|cy on the &s;ide of the people. They who

guard the golden alter of liberty, &s;hould be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of eagle eyes. This &s;acred de|po&s;itum cannot be watched with too great attention. But then there is a wide dif|ference between <HI>rea&s;onable care</HI> and <HI>ca|pricious jealou&s;y.</HI> Allowances are ever to be made for the <HI>involuntary failings of rulers, but none for their de&s;igned faults.</HI> There are, and ever will be, in all free &s;tates, a number of re&s;tle&s;s &s;pirits, who under the &s;pecious clock of liberty, are perpetually rai&s;ing a clamour again&s;t tho&s;e in authority. We need no &s;uch prompters. A gro&s;s infraction of the con&s;titution, and oppre&s;&s;ive mea&s;ures, will be immediately perceived by an intelligent people. Public incendiaries are baneful. To be called into combinations, under the notion of &s;upporting liberty, is always a dangerous mea&s;ure, and ought never to be complied with, except in &s;ome extreme ca&s;es. A government within a government is a mon&s;ter in politicks. It is attended with the mo&s;t unhappy con&s;equences. The be&s;t organized con&s;titution in the world, may be &s;ubverted by the frequent meetings of &s;uch <HI>demagogues.</HI> Of combinations there can be no need, where our rulers are &s;o im|mediately under our controul, where they are elected once a year, and where every

corporate body may meet as often as they plea&s;e, to give in&s;tructions to tho&s;e whom they have deputed from their number. But tho' &s;uch proceedings as I have now menti|oned are ju&s;tly to be di&s;pi&s;ed; yet a ready obedience is not to be expected to re&s;olves and edicts that generally appear to &s;en&s;ible people to be <HI>unwi&s;e</HI> and <HI>hurtful.</HI> It concerns rulers therefore to keep within the boun|daries e&s;tabli&s;hed by common con&s;ent. A departure therefrom will bring their mea&s;ures into contempt. In this ca&s;e they may "re&s;olve and re&s;olve and dye the &s;ame." What &s;ignified the mandatory letters of Philip the &s;econd, to the people of the United States, when the de&s;ign of them was to deprive that people of the unalienable rights of men and chri&s;tians? Equally unavailing were the laws of the Briti&s;h parliament, at the beginning of the&s;e times, when their manife&s;t purpo&s;e was to de&s;poil us of our <HI>chartered rights,</HI> and bring us into a &s;tate of bondage. Such acts are as little regarded as the <HI>bulls</HI> and <HI>thunders</HI> of the <HI>Vatican;</HI> at this enlighten|ed period of chri&s;tianity.</P>
<P>Further, in order to have the word, or laws of rulers come with power, it is ne|ce&s;&s;ary to make frequent appeals to their
<PB N="27" REF="017450_0026_0FA11EAE32C76B90">
con&s;tituents, and inform them of the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of their mea&s;ures. This among an intelligent people has a weighty tenden|cy to procure re&s;pect, and a ready obedi|ence. Indeed this cannot always be done with &s;afety. There is a maxim often mentioned of late, that there &s;hould be no my&s;teries in government. If this be un|der&s;tood of the theoretick principles, it is ju&s;t; but if of the admini&s;tation thereof, it is not always true. The nece&s;&s;ities of the &s;tate &s;ometimes require great &s;ecrecy. The mo&s;t important <HI>expedition</HI> or <HI>negocia|tion</HI> might otherwi&s;e fail. But where &s;e|crecy is not e&s;&s;ential, there the <HI>authority</HI> ought to make known the acce&s;&s;ity of their mea&s;ures. As rulers &s;hould be <HI>ju&s;t,</HI> &s;o they &s;hould remember that they <HI>rule over men,</HI> who are intelligent beings, and who are commonly governed by rea&s;on. To &s;et before them, therefore, the nece&s;&s;ity of their proceedings e&s;pecially when they are burden&s;ome, as is always the ca&s;e in time of war, is the directe&s;t way to have a cheerful compliance. If taxes are heavy, and people know not to what u&s;es they are applied; if they are left to vain conjec|tures, and finally conclude that they are &s;wallowed up in a manner not beneficial to the public, no wonder there is a reluctance
<PB N="28" REF="017450_0027_0FA11EAEF1A8D848">
in paying them. Frequent <HI>&s;ettlements</HI> with tho&s;e who are intru&s;ted with public monies, and a proper account of the expenditure of them, laid before the community, will &s;ilence all murmerings among a people&punc; where rea&s;on is more prevalent than pa&s;&s;i|on, and where every noble principle is not under the controul of avarice.</P>
<P>Again, if rulers would &s;peak with power, they mu&s;t &s;peak in the language of ju&s;tice. All their <HI>laws, re&s;olves</HI> and <HI>taxes</HI> mu&s;t be agreeable to the eternal rules of right. To do impartial ju&s;tice to all; to pre&s;ide with an even hand, and carry the balance in <HI>equilibrio,</HI> is certainly their indi&s;pen&s;ible duty. There is oftentimes a jealou&s;y be|tween the different parts of a nation or com|monwealth; a &s;truggle and competition be|tween the <HI>landed</HI> and <HI>mercantile intere&s;t.</HI> It is the bu&s;ine&s;s of rulers to lay all &s;uch jealou|&s;ies a&s;leep, and by their public determinations demon&s;trate that they are not &s;o friends to the <HI>one</HI> or the <HI>other party,</HI> but that they are greater friends to <HI>truth</HI> and <HI>equity.</HI> The &s;ame rule is to be ob&s;erved in the proportion of taxes, that are laid upon the different &s;tates in the continental confederacy. This &s;hould not only be invariably maintained, but rea&s;onable evidence of it communicated
<PB N="29" REF="017450_0028_0FA11EAFB5087638">
to the con&s;tituents. Nothing gives life and &s;pirit to any corporate body; nothing induces them to &s;ubmit to burdens with greater alacrity than to find they are ne|ce&s;&s;ary and levied in equal proportions.</P>
<P>Further, tho&s;e mea&s;ures that are evident|ly calculated to promote the welfare and pro&s;perity of the republick, are ever atten|ded with energy and power. Govern|ment was in&s;tituted for the happine&s;s of the community at large. Rulers are mini|&s;ters to the people; they &s;hould be <HI>mini|&s;ters of God for good,</HI> and where they are evidently &s;o, there is but little danger of their commands being re&s;i&s;ted. If the people oppo&s;e &s;uch power, thus benevo|lently exerci&s;ed, it is an evidence they have fallen into a mo&s;t di&s;tempered &s;tate, and <HI>are nigh unto cur&s;ing.</HI></P>
<P>Again, in this view much depends on the conduct of the <HI>executive power.</HI> In the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice and execution of the laws, much firmne&s;s, impartiality and mercy are requi&s;ite. The &s;upreme ruler of heaven and earth has required this. He will not allow one rule of admini&s;tration for the poor man, and another for the rich. He &s;ays to the Judges, <HI>take heed
<PB N="30" REF="017450_0029_0FA11EB073DC8128">
what you do; for you judge not for man but for the Lord who is with you in the judg|ment: Wherefore let the fear of the Lord be upon you; for there is no iniquity with the Lord, nor re&s;pect of per&s;ons, nor taking of gifts.</HI> 2 Chro. 19. 6. 7. As on the one hand, they &s;hould not take bribes and favour the rich; &s;o on the other, an idle compa&s;&s;ion &s;hould not lead them to be|friend the poor, and indulge them in mea|&s;ures iniquitous, to the exclu&s;ion of a wor|thy part of the community from their ju&s;t demands. The ob&s;tructing the cour&s;e of <HI>commutative</HI> ju&s;tice even in a &s;mall degree, tho' it may be done under the notion of mercy, is, however, a very pernicious precedent, and in the i&s;&s;ue will be found to be extremely detrimental. It di&s;coura|ges the mo&s;t indu&s;trious part of the com|munity, and puts it out of their power to &s;upport the burdens of government, on who&s;e &s;houlders they principally fall. If any thing further can be done to prevent litigation, and the exhorbitant expences of <HI>&s;uits</HI> in&s;tituted for the recovery of proper|ty, it certainly demands the attention of tho&s;e in power.</P>
<P>The <HI>Judges</HI> of the &s;upreme judicial court have de&s;erved well of the public in the&s;e
<PB N="31" REF="017450_0030_0FA11EB132FBC5E8">
di&s;tracted times. With an even hand with a re&s;olute courage, and with a proper mixture of compa&s;&s;ion have they di&s;tribu|ted ju&s;tice in their circuitous cour&s;e; and much to them are we indebted for that <HI>peace</HI> and <HI>order</HI> which have been con&s;picu|ous at a time when the &s;inews of govern|ment have been much relaxed.</P>
<P><HI>La&s;tly,</HI> if tho&s;e in authority would have their word come with power, they mu&s;t them&s;elves be an example to others. <HI>To lay heavy burdens grievous to be borne, which they will not &s;o much as touch with one of their fingers,</HI> is what a rational people will not &s;uffer in tho&s;e that pre&s;ide over them. Hence we &s;ee the rea&s;on why the mea|&s;ures of Britain with regard to this country were &s;o <HI>very</HI> di&s;gu&s;ting. Living at ea&s;e, and rioting in luxury, they wanted a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance to &s;upport them in this cour&s;e. In this &s;tate they ca&s;t a wi&s;hful look upon America: From us they propo&s;ed to draw a revenue &s;ufficient to uphold their prodi|gality, and enable them to live in &s;plendor and plea&s;ure. Her Parliaments according|ly a&s;&s;umed a right of taxation, and of ma|king laws to bind us in all ca&s;es whatever. Feeling none of the burden, and under the influence of the mo&s;t rapacious de&s;ires,
<PB N="32" REF="017450_0031_0FA11EB1F17F6AD0">
they would &s;oon have brought us into the mo&s;t unhappy &s;ituation, and impo&s;ed bur|dens upon us, which neither <HI>our fathers nor we were able to bear.</HI> But <HI>now</HI> that our rulers feel them&s;elves a proportionable part of the burden, what rational body of men can with propriety complain? Are taxes at any time heavy, and do we under the bur|den begin to entertain hard thoughts? It is enough to repre&s;s the ri&s;ing emotion, when we remember, that the &s;ame per|&s;ons who lay them, bear an equal propor|tion of the whole, and are taxed according to their e&s;tates. As &s;elf intere&s;t has &s;o predominant a &s;way among all orders of men, it cannot be thought, without doing violence to nature, that &s;uch taxes are laid with ill de&s;ign. <HI>Impo&s;ts</HI> and <HI>duties</HI> of the &s;ame denomination with tho&s;e formerly laid upon us by Britain, which were <HI>then</HI> objected again&s;t, may be rea&s;onable <HI>now,</HI> as the objection was not again&s;t the duties them&s;elves, but the <HI>appropriation</HI> of the <HI>monies</HI> thence ari&s;ing, and the <HI>authority</HI> by which they were impo&s;ed.</P>
<P>As it is the bu&s;ine&s;s of tho&s;e in power to &s;ee ju&s;tice done between man and man, and to keep the law open for that purpo&s;e, &s;o example loudly calls upon them, as a
<PB N="33" REF="017450_0032_0FA11EB3D0F771E0">
public body, to do ju&s;tice both to indivi|duals and to other &s;tates. In &s;hort, I mean, it is of high importance that <HI>public credit</HI> be maintained; as a failure of it is attended with a thou&s;and difficulties.</P>
<P>The matter of example is to be extend|ed &s;till further. Rulers &s;hould not only be exemplary in matters that relate to the duties of their particular &s;tation; but in all the virtues of life, they &s;hould go before us in a &s;hining example, if they would have their mea&s;ures properly re&s;pected. Tho&s;e who live at the upper end of the world are greatly ob&s;erved. Their man|ners are contagious. They do as much to &s;upport <HI>order</HI> by their behaviour as by their laws, nay more. As every government makes laws to puni&s;h offenders, propor|tioned to the nature and degree of their crimes, &s;o they ought to adopt a code of regulations which tend to prevent the commi&s;&s;ion of evil. This is the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential and benevolent part of govern|ment. Now, laws of this kind can never be better enforced than by the examples of men in authority. The examples of men in places of eminence and di&s;tinction, have &s;uch an influence on their con&s;titu|ents, that the matter may be aptly illu&s;tra|ted

<P>Thus I have mentioned &s;ome of the principal things that have a tendency to give weight and influence to the public mea&s;ures of <HI>authority.</HI> After all, it is not to be &s;uppo&s;ed, that <HI>every one</HI> will be con|tented. A few dark de&s;igning knaves, a bu&s;y plotting crew love to make di&s;tracted times. But this is certain, where a govern|ment is con&s;tituted and admini&s;tred in the manner above mentioned, the body of the people; a goodly majority will always be in favour of it. For what &s;hould make them oppo&s;e it? Do they think it unne|ce&s;&s;ary? Let them try; let them live without government if they can? A few enthu&s;ia&s;ts in former, and at the pre&s;ent times, thought it a u&s;ele&s;s and burden&s;ome in&s;titution. But they are gro&s;sly mi&s;ta|ken. Indeed, were all men righteous there would be no need of human laws. <HI>The law was not made for the righteous

In vain would it be for individuals to have di&s;tinct intere&s;ts, were they not pre&s;erved in the enjoyment of them, by the combined power of the whole. Dreadful mu&s;t be the &s;tate of the world, when every man does what is right in his own eyes; <HI>when there is no king in I&s;rael</HI> and when every per&s;on gives an unbounded licence to a &s;pirit of <HI>avarice, revenge</HI> and <HI>lu&s;t.</HI> What &s;cenes of mi&s;ery would hence en&s;ue&punc; Altho' a &s;tate of nature may have &s;ome attendant advantages; yet the inconveni|ences of it are a thou&s;and times greater&mdash;It is a &s;tate of war. The pa&s;&s;ions of mankind being left to an uncontrouled range, would multiply numerous &s;pecta|cles of di&s;tre&s;s. <HI>Implacable revenge.</HI> under the <HI>impul&s;e of keen re&s;entment,</HI> would hunt the real or &s;uppo&s;ed offender, and in order to meet him &s;tretch the length of a &s;pa|cious continent, traver&s;e prominent moun|tains, wade through eternal &s;nows, pene|trate almo&s;t inacce&s;&s;ible woods, and when

<P>Again, as <HI>this</HI> is nece&s;&s;ary to the public order and happine&s;s, &s;o it is an <HI>appointment</HI> of heaven, the <HI>ordination</HI> of God, who is a God <HI>of order and not of confu&s;ion.

Who&s;o re&s;i&s;teth the pow|er, re&s;i&s;teth the ordinance of God, and they that re&s;i&s;t &s;hall receive to them&s;elves dam|nation: For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil. Wilt thou then not be afraid of the power? do that which is good, and thou &s;halt have prai&s;e of the &s;ame; for he is the mini&s;ter of God to thee for good; but if thou do that which is evil be afraid; for he beareth not the &s;word in vain; for he is the mini&s;ter of God, a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doth evil; wherefore ye mu&s;t needs be &s;ubject, not only for wrath, but al&s;o for con&s;cience &s;ake.

And in perfect harmony therewith, &s;ays St. Peter; <HI>&s;ubmit your&s;elves to every ordi|nance of man for the Lord's &s;ake, whether it be to the king as &s;upreme, or unto gover|nors as unto them that are &s;ent by him, for the puni&s;hment of evil doers, and for the prai&s;e of them that do well.</HI> From the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages it appears, not only that government is an ordinance of heaven, but al&s;o that obedience to it is a duty enjoin|ed under the highe&s;t penalty.

I &s;hall &s;ay a few things concerning the application of this power, and have done.</P>
<P>It &s;hould be put forth to make the peo|ple indu&s;trious. <HI>Indu&s;try</HI> is the life of all &s;tates. It is this that &s;upports the world. When any are idle there mu&s;t be a deficiency &s;omewhere. The <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> have a maxim that the earth produces no more than is &s;ufficient to maintain ve|ry indu&s;trious per&s;ons.

This indu&s;try is a matter of importance at all times, but more e&s;pecially &s;o, at the pre|&s;ent day, when demands are great for the various product's of the earth. The be&s;t rulers have heretofore been called from the plow. <HI>Cincinnatus</HI> was twice taken from thence, and made <HI>dictator.</HI> Tho' we do not de&s;ire to have all our rulers in this way employed, yet we could wi&s;h to have them indu&s;trious in their proper &s;tations, and thereby &s;et an example of diligence to others, who &s;hould be far|ther excited thereto by <HI>premiums,</HI> and

<P>Frugality is another important object of the rulers attention. This, both as it re|lates to <HI>dre&s;s</HI> and <HI>food</HI> is a matter of moment. Millions &s;ince the pre&s;ent war commenced might have been &s;aved in this way. <HI>Sump|tuary laws</HI> have often times been made; why they &s;hould be improper <HI>now</HI> it is dif|ficult to &s;ay?

<P>The promotion of learning demands the attention of the civil authority. It is never expected that all &s;hould be philo&s;ophers. The &s;tate of the world, the nece&s;&s;ities of mankind demand different improvement of their time and talents. All, however, ought to be taught the rudiments of &s;ci|ence. <HI>Schools</HI> &s;hould be maintained, at the public expence, for this purpo&s;e; otherwi&s;e, in a few years, we &s;hall not know the <HI>nature</HI> or the <HI>value</HI> of that liberty, for which we are now <HI>&s;o ju&s;tly</HI> contending.

They will &s;oon become &s;laves, or run into anarchy. This, therefore teaches the infinite nece&s;&s;ity of diffu&s;ing intelli|gence among the body of the people. Several valuable <HI>literary in&s;titutions</HI> have lately been founded by government; and the e&s;tabli&s;hment adds a brilliancy to their character. The&s;e &s;ocieties are &s;till in their infancy. Much is wanting to their perfections; to make them the glory and ornament of the land. When by a &s;eries of <HI>ob&s;ervation</HI> and <HI>experiment,</HI> by diving into the <HI>arcana</HI> of nature, and inve&s;tigating the <HI>occult qualities</HI> of things, they &s;hall have made con&s;iderable acce&s;&s;ions to the <HI>heep</HI> of &s;cience, then their benign influence will be felt. <HI>Speculative knowledge</HI> may plea&s;e the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, but <HI>that</HI> which is practical is only beneficial to mankind.

<P>Again; religion and morality among the people, are an object of the magi&s;trate's attention. As to religion, they have no farther call to interpo&s;e than is nece&s;&s;ary to give a general encouragement to it. Matters of con&s;cience are to be left to God and our own &s;ouls. <HI>Modes</HI> and <HI>forms</HI> of religion; &s;entiments concerning doctrines, &amp;c. people &s;hould be indulged <HI>in,</HI> without mole&s;tation. If coertion would bring man|kind

kind to a uniformity of &s;entiment, no ad|vantage would re&s;ult therefrom. It is on the contrary be&s;t to have different &s;ects and denominations live in the &s;ame &s;ocieties. They are a mutual <HI>check</HI> and <HI>&s;py</HI> upon each other, and become more attentive to their principles and practice. Hence it has been ob&s;erved that where <HI>Papi&s;ts</HI> and <HI>Prote&s;t|ants</HI> live intermingled together, it &s;erves to meliorate them both. The &s;ame may be ob&s;erved of any other &s;ects. It is how|ever greatly to be lamented that there is not a more catholick and comprehen|&s;ive &s;pirit among different denominations of chri&s;tians. Bigotry and cen&s;oriou&s;ne&s;s &s;our the temper and interrupt the hap|pine&s;s of &s;ociety. The diffu&s;ion of light le&s;&s;ens this unhappy temper; and among people of knowledge, though of different communions, a harmonious intercour&s;e commonly takes place. With madmen and enthu&s;ia&s;ts there can be no agreement, except among people as di&s;tracted as them|&s;elves. But even &s;uch, where they put on a religious gui&s;e, and do not interrupt the peace of &s;ociety, are not to be di&s;turbed by the civil arm. <HI>Render to Cae&s;ar the things that are Cae&s;ar's, and to God the things that are God's. To their own ma&s;|ter they &s;tand or fall.</HI> But that part of
<PB N="43" REF="017450_0042_0FA11EBBB437A530">
religion which has an immediate a&s;pect on the good of the community falls under the cognizance of the ruler. Every thing that tends to promote the fear of God, and reverence for an oath, to advance the inte|re&s;ts of virtue and morality in the world, &s;hould be encouraged and enjoined by tho&s;e in power; for where there is not the fear of God and reverence for an oath, it will be <HI>extremely</HI> difficult to keep the world in order. The <HI>young</HI> &s;hould not only be in|&s;tructed at &s;chools in matters of &s;cience, but al&s;o in the principles of morality; and <HI>they</HI> together with the <HI>adult</HI> &s;hould attend tho&s;e places where they may hear the &s;acred obligations of religion pointed out and inculcated. To compel them to attend any <HI>particular &s;ociety</HI> in preference to <HI>any,</HI> or <HI>all others,</HI> would be an infringe|ment on the rights of con&s;cience. But to oblige them to attend &s;omewhere, is what the authority have an undoubted right to, and it is moreover a mo&s;t benevolent ex|erci&s;e of power: for &s;hould publick in|&s;tructions in religion and morality be laid a&s;ide, <HI>profanene&s;s, barbari&s;m,</HI> and every evil work, would become triumphant. <HI>Righteou&s;ne&s;s exalteth a nation;</HI> it gives dignity, &s;trength and firmne&s;s to every body politick.

But when they lo&s;t their virtue, they were weakned by feuds and factions; they were &s;traightned and brought low; tyrants ruled over them; till at length, being greatly enervated by voluptuou&s;ne&s;s and effemi|nacy, they were overran and totally &s;ub|dued by the hardy &s;ons of the North. <HI>Sin is a reproach</HI> or deba&s;ement <HI>to any people.</HI> It is e&s;pecially detrimental to free &s;tates. State&s;men may plan and &s;peculate for liberty, but it is religion and morality alone which can e&s;tabli&s;h the principles upon which freedom can &s;ecurely &s;tand. The only foundation of a free con&s;titution is pure virtue; and if this cannot be in|&s;pired into the people at large, in a greater mea&s;ure than we have rea&s;on to think they po&s;&s;e&s;s it now, they may change their rulers and the forms of their government, but they will not obtain a la&s;ting liberty; they will only exchange <HI>tyrants</HI> and <HI>ty|rannies.</HI> So fully was <HI>Lycurgus,</HI> the <HI>Spartan</HI> king, per&s;uaded of this truth, that he took particular care of the youth, and had them educated in a manner &s;uited to the genius of their government.</P>

<HI>La&s;tly;</HI> The power of rulers is to be exerted in the management of the great affairs of war. We have rea&s;on to be thankful that wars do not always rage; yet &s;o frequent are they, that they &s;hould be &s;tudied as a &s;cience, and pro&s;ecuted by the rules of art. Britain, a haughty and high-&s;pirited nation, have been at war near half their time for &s;ome centuries pa&s;t. It is lamentable to think what de|&s;olations they have made in the earth. What judgment is there greater than this? How are the civil e&s;tabli&s;hments of former times &s;ubverted by war, and con|fu&s;ion introduced into the world? The blood of our citizens is &s;pilt; the bands which tye together the deare&s;t connexions are frequently in the mo&s;t painful manner di&s;&s;olved; the pen&s;ive widow and the prattling babe being deprived of tho&s;e on whom, under God, was their main de|pendence. What benevolent heart can contemplate the ravages of war without pain? There are none but the <HI>fierce</HI> and <HI>&s;avage</HI> who can delight in &s;cenes of car|nage. But, though the horrors of <HI>war</HI> are great; yet, when we come to con|tra&s;t them with <HI>&s;lavery,</HI> we find the dark|ne&s;s of the <HI>night-piece</HI> immediately le&s;&s;ens! Where &s;lavery reigns, nothing good or

great can po&s;&s;ibly take place. Look into de&s;potick governments, and you find no ebullitions of genius, no &s;trokes of the &s;ublime; but on the contrary, poverty of &s;pirit; a depre&s;&s;ed temper marks the cha|racter of the en&s;laved nation. "What a high value ought we then to &s;et upon liberty, &s;ince without it, nothing great, or &s;uitable to the dignity of human nature can po&s;&s;ibly be produced? Slavery is the &s;etter of the tongue, the chain of the mind as well as the body.&mdash;<HI>Rea&s;on</HI> and <HI>Freedom</HI> are our own, and given to continue &s;o.

The in|vaders of <HI>either</HI> ought to be re&s;i&s;ted by the united force of all men, &s;ince they encroach on the privileges we receive from God, and traver&s;e the de&s;igns of infinite goodne&s;s." Where, therefore, there is no other alternative but <HI>war</HI> or <HI>&s;lavery,</HI> there &s;hould be no kind of he&s;itancy. Being in this &s;ituation, we were compelled, more than &s;even years ago, to take up the &s;word and make our &s;olemn appeal to Heaven, who has remarkably owned our cau&s;e and &s;ucceeded our military en|terprizes.

He delivers the poor that cries, and the father|le&s;s and him that hath none to help him. He is eyes to the blind and feet to the lame. The ble&s;&s;ing of him that is ready to peri&s;h comes upon him; and he cau&s;es the widows heart to &s;ing for joy. He puts on righte|ou&s;ne&s;s, and it cloaths him; his judgment is as a robe and diadem. Such an one is as the light of the morning, when the &s;un ri&s;eht, even a morning without clouds, as the tender gra&s;s &s;pringing out of the earth, by clear &s;hining after rain.</HI> This &s;hould not only reconcile tho&s;e in power to the

arduous and multiplied labours of their places, but al&s;o animate them to the faithful di&s;charge thereof. This will embalm their memory, and procure them ju&s;ter prai&s;e than ever was be|&s;towed on Alexander or Cae&s;ar. Good magi&s;trates are excited to fidelity by <HI>other</HI> and <HI>nobler con&s;ulerations</HI> than tho&s;e of going off the &s;tage with the applau&s;e of their fellow men. They labour to approve them&s;elves to the heart &s;earching, and om|ni&s;cient Jehovah. They know that though they are <HI>called God's,</HI> yet they <HI>mu&s;t die like</HI> other <HI>men,</HI> and <HI>appear before the bar of Chri&s;t,</HI> to an&s;wer for the improvement of their time and talents. Keeping this &s;olemn event in view, they endeavour to approve them&s;elves to their divine ma&s;ter, that &s;o when they are called to account, they may receive this ble&s;&s;ed <HI>euge</HI> from his lips, <HI>well done good and faithful &s;ervants, enter ye into the joy of your Lord.</HI>&mdash;If you, my honored Sirs, act under the impre&s;&s;ion and influence of this &s;olemn thought, I am per&s;uaded the elections of this day, and all the tran&s;actions of the en&s;uing year, will be &s;uch as to meet the approbation of the wi&s;e and virtuous, and bid defiance to the im|potent attacks of di&s;appointed ambition, or the unhallowed clamors of the licentious.</P>

Finally, may the people at large &s;ee the importance of &s;upporting government, and the nece&s;&s;ity of carrying on the war with vigor. We are now in &s;ight of the promi&s;ed land. How humiliating would it be to have our independence, ju&s;t brought to the birth, &s;ail for want of &s;trength to be delivered? To encourage us to per&s;evere, let us anticipate the ri&s;ing glory of America. Behold her &s;eas whitened with commerce; her capitals filled with inhabitants, and re&s;ounding with the din of indu&s;try. See her ri&s;ing to independence and glory. Contemplate the re&s;pectable figure that &s;he will one day make among the nations of the earth; behold her venerable for wi&s;|dom, for coun&s;el and for might; flouri&s;h|ing in &s;cience&punc; in agriculture and navigation, and in all the arts of peace. Figure to your&s;elves that this your native country will are long become the permanent &s;eat of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word">, the retreat of philo&s;ophers, the a&s;ylum of the oppre&s;&s;ed, the umpire of contending nations, and, we would hope, the <HI>glory</HI> of <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> by a &s;trict at|tachment to his go&s;pel, and divine in&s;titu|tions. What though the pre&s;ent genera|tion may not live to &s;ee the completion and fulfilment of the&s;e grand events? If

we have laid the foundation of them, and can die in expectation that our children will ta&s;te the happy fruits of our toil, it will give to benevolent parents the mo&s;t heartfelt joy; and children po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the effects of their fathers &s;acrifice, <HI>will ri&s;e up and call them ble&s;&s;ed</HI>&mdash;But if there be <HI>any</HI> on whom the&s;e noble con&s;idera|tions will make no impre&s;&s;ion, I would beg leave ju&s;t to turn their attention to tho&s;e &s;cenes of di&s;tre&s;s and carnage, which will certainly take place, provided we fail in our pre&s;ent enterprize, and are brought, by artifice or power, to &s;ubmit to the dominion of the Briti&s;h king. May the United States of America therefore bow down their &s;houlders to bear all the future burdens that may be devolved upon them, in the progre&s;&s;ion of this tedious and ex|pen&s;ive conflict. A few more campaigns will determine the event of the pre&s;ent &s;truggle, and doubtle&s;s land us on the rock of independence, &s;ecurity and peace. <HI>Expence</HI> is not to be regarded in a conte&s;t of &s;uch magnitude. What can po&s;&s;ibly be a compen&s;ation for our liberties? It is better to be <HI>free among the dead,</HI> than &s;laves among the living. The gho&s;ts of our friends, &s;lain in war; the &s;pirits of our
<PB N="59" REF="017450_0058_0FA11EC87381BEC8">
illu&s;trious ance&s;tors, long &s;ince gone to re&s;t, who tran&s;mitted our fair inheritance to us; a regard to children &s;till unborn, all call upon us to make greater exertions; and will ri&s;e up in judgment again&s;t us, if, through cowardice, we de&s;ert the noble cau&s;e, in which, for many years pa&s;t, we have been engaged. From the&s;e con&s;i|derations, therefore, let us per&s;evere till we have obtained the completion of our wi&s;hes, and have placed our country be|yond the reach of over-bearing foes.&mdash;But let us remember that we are engaged in a higher warfare; and that, if we over|come our &s;piritual enemies, we &s;hall, at la&s;t, be put in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that kingdom where perpetual peace will reign and liberty, the mo&s;t exalted and refined, &s;hall be obtained. <HI>Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life.</HI></P>
