<Q><BIBL>ISAIAH lxiii. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, &amp; 6.</BIBL>
<P>Who is this that cometh from Edom, with dyed garments from Bozrah? this that is glorious in his apparel, travelling in the greatne&s;s of his &s;trength? I that &s;peak in righteou&s;ne&s;s, mighty to &s;ave.</P>
<P>Wherefore art thou red in thine apparel, and thy garments like him that treadeth in the wine fat?</P>
<P>I have trodden the wine-pre&s;s alone; and of the people there was none with me&punc; for I will tread them in mine anger, and trample them in my fu|ry; and their blood &s;hall be &s;prinkled upon my garments, and I will &s;tain all my raiment.</P>
<P>For the day of vengeance is in mine heart, and the year of my redeemed is come.</P>
<P>And I looked, and there was none to help: and I wondered that there was none to uphold: there|fore mine own arm brought &s;alvation unto me; and my fury, it upheld me.</P>
<P>And I will tread down the people in mine anger, and make them drunk in my fury, and I will bring down their &s;trength to the earth.</P></Q>

<P>ONCE more has the &s;wift current of time produced the day, upon which our church calls on her children to look up with a mixture of joy and melancholy to the cro&s;s, whereon was accompli&s;hed the &s;tupendous work of the &s;alva|tion of the world&mdash;A day never to be forgot|ten, always to be re&s;pected by every one who is not a&s;hamed of the cro&s;s of Chri&s;t, by every one who glories in the name of a chri&s;tian.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="020836_0005_0FB136EF9C24E138">THE holy prophet, being, by the &s;pirit of God, brought forward thro' many ages of futu|rity, beholds our Saviour returning from his &s;evere conte&s;t with his &s;piritual foes&mdash;his head crowned with never-fading laurels&mdash;his gar|ments deeply &s;tained with the crim&s;on &s;pots, which were the price of his victory.
<Q>Who art thou,</Q>
cries the Prophet with awful &s;ur|prize,
<Q>coming from the land of blood, from the fields of tribulation, with bloody raiment; who neverthele&s;s art cloathed in glory, and putte&s;t on maje&s;ty it&s;elf as a garment, and walke&s;t in the height of &s;uperlative power?</Q>
The ble&s;&s;ed Conqueror an&s;wers,
<Q><HI>I,</HI> who&s;e word is the e&s;&s;ence of truth, and who am able to &s;ave to the uttermo&s;t.</Q>
I&s;ai|ah further enquires,
<Q>Wherefore is thine ap|parel &s;o bloody and your garments red, like the garments of him that treadeth in the wine-fat?</Q>
"The wine-pre&s;s," replies the Me&s;&s;iah,
<Q>indeed have I trodden; and have trodden it alone; of all my friends and fol|lowers, there was none continued with me in that trying hour; But as for mine enemies, they &s;hall be made my foot-&s;tool; my im|penitent, incorrigible adver&s;aries will I tram|ple under foot in my ju&s;t indignation; my garments &s;hall be &s;tained with their blood; <HI>I will break them with a rod of iron; I will da&s;h them in pieces like a potter's ve&s;&s;el.</HI> For the day of vengeance is come, the time, when I am to brui&s;e the &s;erpent's head&mdash;to open the pri&s;on doors and liberate the redeemed cap|tives. In that tremendous cri&s;is, I looked
<PB N="7" REF="020836_0006_0FB136F129E3C140">
round for a&s;&s;i&s;tance, but no man appeared to help me&punc; Of my own cho&s;en di&s;ciples, one had betrayed me&punc; another had denied me, and all had for&s;aken me.&mdash;Then, in my va&s;t a&s;toni&s;hment, and bitterne&s;s of grief, I cried out MY GOD, MY GOD, WHY HAST THOU FORSAKEN ME!&mdash;But my God had not entirely for&s;aken me, becau&s;e he had pro|mi&s;ed, that when I &s;hould de&s;cend into hell (as I a&s;&s;uredly mu&s;t to complete my work of redemption) he would not leave my &s;oul there. Then had I recour&s;e to the omnipo|tence of mine own arm; my fortitude and re&s;olution upheld me. Woe to all who op|po&s;e me, or ob&s;truct the great bu&s;ine&s;s, that I am performing. Woe to them that &s;lan|der, de&s;pi&s;e or neglect the &s;alvation which I have purcha&s;ed by this conflict; for I will trend them down in mine anger, I will a&s;ton|i&s;h them with my fury; their mo&s;t a&s;piring pride, power and hopes I will bring down to the earth: I will laugh at their calamity, I will mock when their fear cometh.</Q></P>
<P>THIS is the wonderful atchievement of that divine Hero, who hath aboli&s;hed death, and hath brought life and immortality to light&punc; This is the narrative thereof, as given by him|&s;elf. This atchievement, it is our bu&s;ine&s;s, our duty, our honour to celebrate with admiration and gratitude: To this purpo&s;e the pre&s;ent day of the year is e&s;pecially dedicated; for this laudable purpo&s;e we are now convened.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="020836_0007_0FB136F291525380">WHETHER we con&s;ider the greatne&s;s of the work of redemption, the dignity of the Redeem|er, the meanne&s;s and wretchedne&s;s of the per|&s;ons to be redeemed, the depth of mi&s;ery from which they were to be rai&s;ed, the bli&s;s and glory to which they were to be exalted, the conde&s;cen|&s;ion of our Saviour, or the privileges purcha&s;ed for mankind by his blood&mdash;Whichever of the&s;e points we con&s;ider, we &s;hall become lo&s;t in a labyrinth of wonder and amazement: We &s;hall find a my&s;terious complication of wi&s;dom, grace and benevolence on the part of heaven; but of folly and wickedne&s;s on the part of man. The mo&s;t &s;uperficial contemplation of the&s;e matters will convince us, that in the redemp|tion of the world, there are my&s;teries, to which the utmo&s;t perception of Arch-Angels is far from being adequate&mdash;My&s;teries, which Che|rubim and Seraphim in vain de&s;ire to compre|hend; at which all the heavenly ho&s;t &s;tand a&s;ton|i&s;hed. What operation then, &s;hould a &s;urvey of the&s;e things have on the children of men, for who&s;e benefit the&s;e my&s;teries originated, and who are principally intere&s;ted therein? The bare recollection of what our Saviour has done and &s;uffered for us, ought (at lea&s;t during the pre&s;ent anniver&s;ary) to bani&s;h every other care from our minds. When we meditate on the bitterne&s;s of his &s;ufferings; when we view the nails piercing his hands and his feet, the &s;pear thru&s;t into his &s;ide; the reproaches, the &s;tripes and the agonies he endured, our minds ought to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the deepe&s;t melancholy the &s;in|cere&s;t grief; but when we mu&s;e upon the heav|enly
<PB N="9" REF="020836_0008_0FB136F512A4CBF0">
trea&s;ures, the un&s;peakable felicity, pur|cha&s;ed for us, by the price of his cro&s;s and pa&s;|&s;ion, then &s;hould our hearts be enraptured with extatic joy, with the height of gratitude.</P>
<P>BEHOLD the wonders of redeeming love! Admire the &s;trength, the height, the depth, the extent of cele&s;tial grace! Stand a&s;toni&s;hed at the compa&s;&s;ion and affection of the Son of God towards mean worms of the du&s;t! That divine Per&s;on&punc; who, in perfect equality with his Father, inhabiteth eternity, who <HI>in</HI> and <HI>of</HI> him&s;elf is po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of infinite wi&s;dom, power and happine&s;s, he conde&s;cended to undertake a mean birth, a &s;orrowful life, and (what is &s;till more a&s;toni&s;h|ing) to &s;uffer the grievous, &s;hameful, accur&s;ed death of the cro&s;s.&mdash;And for whom was all this performed? For aliens and enemies; for us, who were wretched, and mi&s;erable; and poor, and blind, and naked. Who can be found among mankind, that would lay down his life for his deare&s;t friend, his greate&s;t bene|factor, or the be&s;t of the human race? much le&s;s for a &s;tranger, or an enemy? Our ble&s;&s;ed Redeemer's affection &s;oars as much above that of man, as his thoughts are above our thoughts, and his ways above our ways. Well therefore might the Apo&s;tle cry out, <HI>Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us.</HI> Well therefore might our Saviour graciou&s;ly declare to his di&s;ciples, <HI>Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friend.</HI></P>
<P>As the &s;ufferings and death of our gracious
<PB N="10" REF="020836_0009_0FB136F652EC8738">
Redeemer are of the utmo&s;t importance, and are, to the la&s;t degree, intere&s;ting to the world of mankind&mdash;As none of Adam's po&s;terity could have been &s;aved without them, and by them eternal &s;alvation is purcha&s;ed for, and of|fered to all men; &s;o a great number of the mo&s;t plain and material predictions of the an|tient, in&s;pired prophets of God point to the&s;e &s;ufferings and center therein. Thus was it foretold that the Me&s;&s;iah &s;hould be a man of &s;orrows and acquainted with grief: His af|flictions and oppre&s;&s;ions, his brui&s;es and wounds were mentioned in the book of I&s;aiah; al&s;o his being numbered with tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors, brought to the &s;laughter and cut off from the land of the living. Another Prophet mentions the very price for which he was betrayed, and their look|ing on him, whom they had pierced; the pierc|ing his hands and his feet; their parting his garments, and ca&s;ting lots upon his ve&s;ture; the&s;e and almo&s;t every other e&s;&s;ential circum|&s;tance of his clo&s;e of life were manife&s;tly fore|told, whole centuries before their accompli&s;h|ment; and foretold in &s;uch a manner, that they cannot, with the lea&s;t colour of probabili|ty, be applied to any other tran&s;action.</P>
<P>IT may furthermore, with great propriety be ob&s;erved, on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, that almo&s;t innumerable <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span"> ordinances of the Jewi&s;h Church, typified this great, precious &s;a|crifice for &s;in; the &s;acrifice which the Son of God made of his own body on the altar of the cro&s;s. Thus the Pa&s;chal Lamb, which under
<PB N="11" REF="020836_0010_0FB1373855BA2A10">
the law, was offered for the &s;ins of the people, was de&s;igned to repre&s;ent the Lamb of God, who was to atone for the &s;ins of the world: Thus the lifting up of the brazen &s;erpent in the wilderne&s;s, was a lively type of the Saviour on the cro&s;s: Thus the &s;olemn and memorable day of atonement prefigured the ob&s;ervable day, we are now celebrating. For a parallel between the great day of atonement or expia|tion under the law, and the valuable oblation performed on the pre&s;ent anniver&s;ary by our great High-Prie&s;t, I would refer you to the epi&s;tle directed to the Hebrews. The author of that epi&s;tle has compared the bu&s;ine&s;s of the&s;e two days, and has, in a great variety of in&s;tan|ces, demon&s;trated how much &s;uperior the &s;a|crifice and the &s;acrificer of the go&s;pel are to tho&s;e of the law: He makes it mo&s;t evidently appear, that our High-Prie&s;t <HI>hath obtained a more excellent mini&s;try, by how much al&s;o he is the Mediator of the better covenant which was e&s;tab|li&s;hed upon better promi&s;es.</HI> The &s;ame author, under the influence of the Holy Gho&s;t has like|wi&s;e proved beyond a po&s;&s;ibility of contradic|tion that <HI>Chri&s;t, being come an High-Prie&s;t of good things to come, by a greater and more perfect taber|nacle not made with hands, that is to &s;ay not of this building; neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood, he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption for us.</HI></P>
<P>IF we look into the intention, wherewith this great annual fea&s;t appointed, and the pur|po&s;es
<PB N="12" REF="020836_0011_0FB1373A02BA45D0">
wherewith it has, through a long &s;eries of ages, been ob&s;erved; we &s;hall find that whil&s;t the devout and exemplary fathers of chri&s;tiani|ty mourned for the agonies of their benevolent Redeemer expiring on the cro&s;s; they at the &s;ame time lamented, with deep and &s;erious peni|tence, tho&s;e dete&s;table &s;ins, that brought the pre|cious life of Je&s;us Chri&s;t to &s;uch a deplorable cata&s;trophe. One e&s;&s;ential branch of our bu&s;i|ne&s;s on this day is to offer to God the &s;acrifice of broken hearts and contrite &s;pirits&mdash;of hearts broken with grief for our wickedne&s;s, of &s;pi|rits deeply contrite for our offences; this is an oblation more plea&s;ing to God than ten thou|&s;and &s;acrificed rams, and whole oceans of con|&s;ecrated oil.</P>
<P>OUR &s;ins brought the Son of God into a world of troubles and temptations; our wickedne&s;s betrayed, mocked, buffeted and &s;courged him; our crimes in&s;ulted him, crowned him with a crown of thorns, and finally crucified him. Shall we not, then, humble our&s;elves to the very du&s;t for tho&s;e iniquities, which brought our &s;upreme benefactor to the death of a crim|inal? Shall we not bewail, in tears of blood, tho&s;e abominations, that wrung large drops of blood from the face of the great captain of our &s;alvation? Shall we not abhor, and utterly for|&s;ake tho&s;e execrable tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, that were the cau&s;e of our Saviour's agonies, and will, if per&s;i&s;ted in, lead us into eternal mi&s;ery of &s;oul and body?</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="020836_0012_0FB1373C76F66F40">IN the primitive ages of chri&s;tianity, with what holy zeal, with what warm devotion, was the annual humiliation of this day ob&s;erved! How lengthy and &s;evere were their fa&s;tings! How deep and &s;erious their repentance! How conformable to the occa&s;ion and bu&s;ine&s;s of the day, were all their thoughts, words and actions!</P>
<P>LET us, in humble imitation of their bright example, improve this whole day in fa&s;ting, prayer and meditation, bewailing the agonies of our divine ma&s;ter, who&s;e affection induced him to die for us, and humbling our&s;elves for our &s;ins, as the cau&s;e of his crucifixion. For our a&s;&s;i&s;tance in this matter, the cour&s;e of this day's &s;ervice is calculated as much as po&s;&s;ible for the purpo&s;es of humility, penitence and edification. What &s;acred melancholy, what &s;edate and god|ly &s;orrow for &s;in, what &s;alutary repentance, what purity of heart, what pious temper of &s;oul are excited by an attentive and devout u&s;e of the forms provided for the wor&s;hip of the pre&s;ent day! Is it a great matter, is it a mighty burden to devote one day in the year to contem|plate, in a particular manner, the death of Chri&s;t, &s;ince he died for our &s;ake? It is our rea&s;onable &s;ervice, it is the lea&s;t return we can de&s;ire to make him, it is an acknowledgement very in|adequate to the benefit received.</P>
<P>WHILST we are &s;olemnizing the day of the great, univer&s;al oblation for &s;in, let us do it in &s;uch a manner as to prepare us for the more chearful, but no le&s;s &s;olemn offices of the third

day from hence, called EASTER: That day will di&s;clo&s;e to our view &s;cenes far different from tho&s;e now before us; then will be brought to our con&s;ideration a Saviour conquering all the powers of &s;in and &s;atan, of death and darkne&s;s, bur&s;ting the adamantine chains of the tomb, totally defeating the king of terrors, trampling under foot the infernal potentates in their own territories, and leading captive captivity it&s;elf. Upon that ble&s;&s;ed, happy day, we are invited to a &s;piritual <HI>fea&s;t of fat things, a fea&s;t of wines on the lees, of fat things full of marrow, of wines on the lees well refined.</HI> To this plea&s;ing, glo|rious fea&s;t, I a&s;k you in the name of God, as his Amba&s;&s;ador, I call you in Chri&s;t's behalf, who died equally for you and me, I exhort you, as ye love your own &s;alvation. Our ble&s;&s;ed Lord intreats and commands us &s;piritually to eat his fle&s;h and drink his blood, and to do this in re|membrance of him; the&s;e precious words he repeats; how gracious, how valuable are the&s;e words, both in the holy &s;cripture, and in our liturgy!&mdash;DO THIS IN REMEMBRANCE OF ME &mdash;in remembrance of my &s;ufferings, of my cro&s;s and pa&s;&s;ion, of mine ine&s;timable oblation and precious blood, of my de&s;cent into hell, my return from thence, and re&s;urrection from the dead, mine a&s;cen&s;ion into heaven, and continu|al, potent interce&s;&s;ion, and my coming ag<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters"> to the final judgment.</P>
