<P>SOLOMON the Wi&s;e (as the Learn|ed well ob&s;erve) in the former part of our Context, is in&s;tructing Sub|jects with their Duty toward Rulers, Which Duty he urges upon them with many excellent Motives and Arguments to enforce their Loyalty &amp; Obe|dience; and left Rulers from what he had &s;aid concerning the Obedience of the Sub|ject, &s;hou'd take occa&s;ion to abu&s;e their Power, le&s;t they &s;hou'd think them&s;elves Priviledged ones to do as they li&s;t, &amp; become Arbitrary &amp; De&s;potick: He therefore brings in a Ca|veat, and in&s;erts an Admonition and puts them in mind that as Subjects may not Re|bel again&s;t lawful Authority (and indeed

<P>As for the Character, Properties and Qualifications of &s;uch a Ruler,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>A good Ruler mu&s;t be a good man.</HI> Such is the Connexion between Piety &amp; Chri&s;tian Policy, that a man mu&s;t be a GOOD man, in order to his being a Good Ruler; a Con|&s;ciencious man, one that fears God, that walks with the fear of God before his Eyes. This is agreeable to what we have in God's Word; Exod. 18. 21. <HI>Thou &s;halt provide &s;uch as fear God, and place &s;uch to be Rulers.</HI> So <HI>Deut.</HI> 17. 14, 15. particularly <HI>ver.</HI> 19. which tho' &s;poken with expre&s;s reference to Su|preme Rulers, yet not exclu&s;ive of Inferior and Subordinate Officers.

Rulers in a Chri&s;tian-Common-wealth have a <HI>Sacred Dep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="AELD" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;itum</HI> put into their hands. And as we have all rea&s;on in the world to fear, that men who&s;e Bia&s;s is not Grace, will do no great Service for God &amp; Religion, &s;o likewi&s;e that they will do a great deal of Mi&s;chief. If great men be good men, their goodne&s;s makes their greatne&s;s Honourable&punc; but if they are bad men, their greatne&s;s makes their badne&s;s but the more Shameful &amp; Dangerous. And Famous <HI>Bolton</HI> writing to a great man, tells him out of <HI>Na|zianzen That never any man void of the true fear of God, can po&s;&s;ibly be cordially and con&s;cionably Serviceable to men on Earth;</HI> and much more to the &s;ame purpo&s;e &s;ays that Man. Such men are acted by Self-love, and governed by Self-intere&s;t at be&s;t: Seek to &s;erve them&s;elves, and oft want nothing but an Opportunity &amp; Temptation to throw off the Mask; as is too often &s;een in Magi&s;trates &amp; Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel too. Such men are unfit &amp; unworthy to Rule over the Lord's People, who are unwilling to be Ruled by God him&s;elf. We read, <HI>P&s;al.</HI> 82.6. Civil Rulers are &s;tyled <HI>Gods.</HI> They are &s;o by Deputation; they are GOD's Repre&s;entatives, Cloathed with his Image, Adorned with Maje&s;ty &amp; Power by him&punc; and &s;hine with his Rays: But he who is not
<PB N="6" REF="002662_0009_0FE5F9875B617DB0">
partaker of the Divine Nature and ve&s;ted with the Moral Beatifying Communicable Attributes of God, an't fit to bear the Scep|ter of Rule &amp; Government over a Chri&s;tian Common-wealth. Shall it be &s;aid by <HI>Zeno|phon,</HI> That &s;uch was the Court of <HI>Cirus, That if a man blindfold &s;hould &s;eek he could not mi&s;s of a good man?</HI> And &s;hall a Chri&s;tian People think Moral goodne&s;s no nece&s;&s;ary Qualifica|tion for Rulers? The Father of <HI>Con&s;tantine the Great,</HI> is &s;aid to have turned off &s;ome of his Courtiers and Councillors, &s;aying, <HI>He can't be faithful to me, who is unfaithful to God. Pietate &s;ublata tellitur Fides.</HI> I have oft with wonderment thought of <HI>Frederick</HI> a <HI>Gothick</HI> King and an <HI>Arian,</HI> who having a Servant that was near and dear to him, and of the Orthodox Faith; but turned <HI>Arian,</HI> hoping thereby to plea&s;e his Ma&s;ter and recommend him&s;elf to his more peculiar Favour; the King his Ma&s;ter coming to under&s;tand it, mo&s;t &s;everely Puni&s;hed him; commanding &s;uddenly, <HI>Capite multari,</HI> giving this for his Rea&s;on (as he above&s;aid) <HI>Qui non,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>He that won't be faithful to his God, I can't ex|pect will be &s;o to me.</HI> And to talk of mens being good Common-wealths men and fit to bear Rule over Religious People, and yet they not be men of Religion, is to talk at <HI>Random,</HI> without Rea&s;on or Religion. He
<PB N="7" REF="002662_0010_0FE5F99F941DD760">
that is not a good man or but only &s;o, can never be a good Ruler, &s;ays <HI>Fuller.</HI> But this an't the only nece&s;&s;ary Qualification.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Knowledge &amp; good Under&s;tanding is another Qualification that fits men for Rule.</HI> And in|deed without this, men will be but Cyphers. They who Rule &s;hould be Knowing men in the nature and end of Government, and the Laws which ought to be the mea&s;ure and boundaries of their Rule and Government. An Ignorant man may chance to do Ju&s;tice, but much as the Blind man hits the mark: There is great hazard that either he prove ra&s;h &amp; precipitant and go beyond the Line, or el&s;e thro' fear or cowardize he fall mi&s;e|rably &s;hort; and &s;o the be&s;t of Cau&s;es may be mi&s;erably betrayed 'Tis e&s;pecially dan|gerous when Un-skilful men &s;it Judges in heavy &amp; weighty Ca&s;es. Many times thro' the cunning Craft and Subtlety of learned &amp; &s;tudied Lawyers, Judgment fails and falls in the Gate, and poor People ly under the weight of Oppre&s;&s;ion and Inju&s;tice; and all under the pretence &amp; colour of Law (wou'd to God it be never the mi&s;erable &s;tate of this Land) I &s;han't pretend to tell you the <HI>mini|mum quod &s;ic,</HI> of Knowledge nece&s;&s;ary; but 'tis certain that the lower degrees will not make men <HI>Strong Rods to Rule.</HI> There will

<P N="3">3. <HI>Prudence &amp; Di&s;cretion is another nece&s;&s;ary Qualification.</HI> Good Rulers will be di&s;creet in their Admini&s;trations and Government. Wi&s;dom will guide their Tongues Heads &amp; Hands too. Men who in the Executions of their Powers, will di&s;tingui&s;h between Cau&s;e and Cau&s;e, Men and Men, Times &amp; Sea&s;ons.
