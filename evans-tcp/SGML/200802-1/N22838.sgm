<P>MANY have been much divided in their opi|nions and various their conjectures, upon the cau&s;es from which the late fever took its ri&s;e; which raged in Charle&s;ton with &s;uch malignancy, during the au|tumn of the pre&s;ent aera of 1796.</P>

<HEAD>An ESSAY on FEVERS.</HEAD>
<P>IT will appear nece&s;&s;ary in the fir&s;t place to lay down the &s;ymptoms generally attendant on the fever alluded to, throughout its different &s;tages.&mdash;And this end may be be&s;t accompli&s;hed by a detail of its various &s;ymptoms, by quoting the following ca&s;e <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The patient alluded to was a man about forty-nine years of age, and neither of a plethoric nor gro&s;s habit of body.</NOTE> which came under the immediate eye of the publi&s;h|er, in the line of his practice; and at the &s;ame time, lay down the curative part and the regimen which he pur&s;ued.</P>
<P>On Monday the 23d of Augu&s;t, 1796, the pati|ent complained of non-appetency, naucea and vomit|ing, fulne&s;s, ten&s;ion, and pain at the &s;tomach; the vi&s;cera ten&s;e and full; the tongue clammy and foul; the &s;tate of the pul&s;e irregular and &s;luggi&s;h; together with la&s;&s;itude and pro&s;tration of &s;pirits. Had re|cour&s;e to a gentle emetic of the Vin: Ipecac: &amp; An|tim: and in the evening to a lenient purgative, both
<PB N="2" REF="030167_0004_0FE4F68FB88E9788">
of which re&s;pectively operated well, and in the cour&s;e of the day &s;upplied the di&s;ea&s;ed plentifully with light attenuating and diluting drinks.</P>
<P>24th. The &s;ymptoms (as above recited) &s;eemed to increa&s;e; per&s;piration became impeded; chill ri|gours were &s;ucceeded by flu&s;hing heats. The pul&s;e at times high and changeable; pains in the extre|mities, and between the &s;capula's, which extended &s;eemingly under the plate of the &s;ternum to the &s;to|mach and belly; the urine reddi&s;h and &s;mall in quan|tity; purged freely, the &s;tools of a darki&s;h hue; had recour&s;e to antiphlogi&s;tics, and &s;upplied plenti|fully with diluting and attenuating drinks.</P>
<P>25th. The &s;ymptoms nearly the &s;ame as ye&s;terday, excepting that the pul&s;e ro&s;e from &s;eventy to ninety-eight; was changeable, and attended at times with a tremulous motion and great &s;tricture. The tongue &s;cruffed over with a thick yellow mucus, and li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed on each margin with li&s;ts of a darki&s;h hue; the uvula and ton&s;ils red and much inflamed; the head much engaged; the urine red and &s;mall in quantity. Had free recour&s;e to purgatives and the antiphlogi&s;|tic line, although no vi&s;ible abatement took place in any of the &s;ymptoms.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="030167_0004_0FE4F68FB88E9788" MS="y">26th. The pul&s;e this day &s;eemed weak and tremu|lous; the tongue much as before de&s;cribed; the heat of the body great; the urine reddi&s;h; nau<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ea frequent; the head much engaged; general la&s;&s;i|tude; the thir&s;t urgent; and petechiae appeared over the &s;urface of the &s;kin. This day had recour&s;e to the antimonial wine; purged freely; gave al&s;o the anti&s;pa&s;modic medicines, and drank plentifully of light diaphoretic and diluting drinks.</P>
<P>27th. The pul&s;e much lower at times, with an ob&s;tructed tremulous motion, and again its vibrati|on quicker, in &s;o much, that little dependence could be placed on their irregular &s;tate. The head, at times, much engaged and di&s;tracted; the tongue dry and &s;cruffed; the urine reddi&s;h; the heat of body much increa&s;ed; the &s;tate of the vi&s;cera continued ten&s;e and painful to the touch. Had recour&s;e to free purgings; the anti&s;pa&s;modic line; neutral &s;alts, and gave plentifully of light attenuating and diaphoretic drinks.</P>
<P>28th. The pul&s;e unequal and changeable, at times quick and weak; again &s;luggi&s;h and tremulous; the heat of the body great, and the petechiae over the &s;urface of the &s;kin; the urine turgid and &s;till &s;mall in quantity; the &s;tomach and neighbouring vi&s;cera
<PB N="4" REF="030167_0005_0FE4F69237F06770">
ten&s;e and &s;ore to the touch. Purged copiou&s;ly, and followed the &s;ame line as ye&s;terday was adopted.</P>
<P>29th. The &s;tate of the pul&s;e very irregular and unequal in mea&s;ure; the heat of body great; the la&s;&s;itude and pro&s;tration of &s;pirits infinite; the urine turgid and &s;mall in quantity, and the tongue dry and li&s;ted; the head much engaged with delirium, and no remi&s;&s;ion or intermi&s;&s;ion appeared in anywi&s;e indi|cative of a &s;tate at this time; the anti&s;pa&s;modic line pur&s;ued until about twelve o'clock, when the pain in the head increa&s;ed over the coronal &s;uture<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&punc; down to the &s;phinoidals, and extended along the os frontis, &s;o as to become intolerable, which was fol|lowed with delirium, &amp;c. At this time the pul&s;e be|came ten&s;e and tremulous, and at other times, quick hard and irregular; the vi&s;cera continued hard, full and painful to the touch, although perfectly open. Now had recour&s;e to the cardiac and diaphoretic medicines, ca&s;tor, camph. mo&s;ch. rad. &s;erpent. virg. &amp;c. with plentiful draughts of light attenuating and diluting drinks, until about eleven o'clock at night, at which time a critical and mo&s;t profu&s;e &s;weat broke out, which continued for two hours, and relieved the pains of the head, delirium, &amp;c. The per&s;pira|tion dried off, and returned in two hours after, and continued until half pa&s;t five o'clock on Monday the 30th, which produced a favorable and perfect &s;tate.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="030167_0005_0FE4F69237F06770">It is not unworthy of our attention to remark, that none of the &s;ymptoms in this fever had ever abated, but rather went on uniformly increa&s;ing until about the time of the cri&s;is being had, except a mitigation of the pains in the extremities, and lu|cid intervals of tho&s;e in the head. The &s;tate of the pul&s;e variable and uncertain, and at times very little or no dependence to be relyed on their &s;tate. The tongue con&s;tantly &s;cruffed over, dry and li&s;ted; the heat of body great; the &s;tomach and vi&s;cera ten&s;e, and &s;ore to the touch; the urine turgid, reddi&s;h, and &s;mall in quantity.</P>
<P>In fine, every expedient was tried, and every mode adopted, which a regular line of theory might direct, or a judicious cour&s;e of practice point out.</P>
<P>From the recital of the above ca&s;e, the &s;ymptoms of this fever (as alluded to) may ea&s;ily be di&s;covered, and in order &s;till to throw as clear a light as po&s;&s;ible in this point, it may not be improper if we examine into the primary cau&s;es of fevers, and al&s;o into the &s;tate of the blood, and its circulating powers; and how it may be actuated upon by blood-letting, and various other cau&s;es.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="030167_0006_0FE4F69D19E4D478">At the &s;ame time lay down a regular line for the curative part and regimen mo&s;t expedient to be adopted in this fatal di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>The cau&s;es which principally may give ri&s;e to this fever (as a learned author &s;ays) &s;eems to be in &s;ome ca&s;es owing to a plethora, &s;uppo&s;ed to owe its origin to a preternatural fulne&s;s and di&s;tention of the &s;an|guineous ve&s;&s;els from too great and increa&s;ed a quantity of blood and juices in general.</P>
<P>But upon a more minute enquiry it will appear to be owning to a &s;uperabundant quantity of the fibrous cra&s;&s;amentum, or more &s;izy parts of the blood, in proportion to the ferous or thinner; which becomes difficult to be circulated through the &s;maller and mi|nute capillary ve&s;&s;els; or propelled from the extre|mities of the arterial into the venal &s;y&s;tem, whence di&s;tention and dilitation of the arteries, an impedi|ment to free, ea&s;y, and ready circulation of the blood, and an increa&s;ed re&s;i&s;tance to the force and action of the heart are the con&s;equences.</P>
<P>The curative part much depends on deplating the ve&s;&s;els and attenuating the blood. This can be&s;t be effected by gentle and moderate bleedings, lenien<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> purgatives, the volatile and neutral &s;alts, and plent<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of diluting and attenuating drinks.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="030167_0006_0FE4F69D19E4D478">This malady may al&s;o originate from ob&s;tructed per&s;piration, or a &s;toppage of the cutaneous excre|tion by cold, which often proves to be the cau&s;e.</P>
<P>To obtain that much de&s;ired relief re&s;olution bids the faire&s;t, as our fir&s;t attempt &s;hould be to reduce the febrile impetus to proper and moderate bounds and to remove or dimini&s;h the cau&s;e of the di&s;ea&s;e by judicious blood-letting in the beginning, which &s;hould be repeated as the urgency of the ca&s;e may require, and the violence of the &s;ymptoms direct.</P>
<P>Many cau&s;es may be a&s;&s;igned as the parent of this di&s;order, and other cla&s;&s;es of fevers.</P>
<P>In every fever the pul&s;e becomes quicker than na|tural, and the functions of the body more or le&s;s impaired or viciated. The cau&s;es of fevers will then be &s;uch as by their irritation can quicken the circu|lation, and excite &s;pa&s;modic con&s;trictions in the &s;e|veral parts of the body; and tho&s;e may be di&s;tin|gui&s;hed into general and particular. The general or epedemic fevers may effect a whole family or city, and for the mo&s;t part depends on putre&s;&s;ent mias|mata, or infectious particles lodged in the air, or upon its manife&s;t qualities, &s;uch as heat or cold, moi&s;ture or dryne&s;s, &amp;c.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="030167_0007_0FE4F69F03D2FD18" MS="y">The particular cau&s;es of fevers, or &s;uch as affect individuals only, may be referred to three cla&s;&s;es.</P>
<P N="1">1st. To purulent fomes from confined matter within the body, the con&s;equence of &s;uppuration.</P>
<P N="2">2d. To a putre&s;&s;ent, acrimonious &s;tate of the juices, occa&s;ioned by putrid bilious fomes.</P>
<P N="3">3d. To ob&s;tructed per&s;piration.</P>
<P>From fevers of the fir&s;t cla&s;s, belong tho&s;e hectical and and colliquative. From the &s;econd cla&s;s, tho&s;e of the putrid malignant kind. From the third cla&s;s or ob&s;tructed per&s;piration, acute, inflammatory, (according to the habit of body of the patient,) low nervous, rheumatic, and intermittent fevers.</P>
<P>The curative indications in fevers in general may be thus reduced.&mdash;The fir&s;t to correct and expel the cau&s;es which by its irritation it originated. The &s;e|cond will depend upon proper management and a ju&s;t regulation of the powers of nature, keeping the febrile impetus within due bounds for the proper coc|tion of the febrile matter. The third will con&s;i&s;t in providing for the relief of the mo&s;t urgent &s;ymptoms.</P>
<P>The &s;ymptoms in fevers mo&s;t frequent and trou|ble&s;ome are&mdash;In the beginning cold &s;hiverings &s;uc|ceeded by flu&s;hing heat, nau<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ea and vomiting, thir&s;t,
<PB N="9" REF="030167_0007_0FE4F69F03D2FD18">
anxiety, a diarrhea, petechiae, profu&s;e &s;weatings, watchings, delirium, comato&s;e affections and con|vul&s;ions. The&s;e being the effects, as that is abated will often cea&s;e, but by removing and weakening the cau&s;e which produced them, we arrive at a per|fect &s;tate.</P>
<P>The &s;ymptoms attendant on the pre&s;ent fever de|pends on an inflammatory or &s;pa&s;modic affection of the &s;everal organs, a quickened circulation, or too den&s;e and vi&s;&s;id a &s;tate of the fluids.</P>
<P>The cold &s;hiverings &s;trongly indicate a &s;pa&s;modic &s;tricture of the &s;maller or capillary ve&s;&s;els; the heat that &s;ucceeds depends on the increa&s;ed and quickened circulation, and &s;ometimes upon an inte&s;tinal moti|on, or putre&s;&s;ent fermentation in the blood and juices.</P>
<P>The heat is to be mitigated by abating its cau&s;e. If from an increa&s;ed circulation, by evacuations and antiphlogi&s;tics; if from a putrid cau&s;e, by anticeptics and gentle diaphoretic medicine, &s;uch as vegetable acids, neutral &s;alts, bark, together with a proper cardiac regimen, &amp;c.</P>
<P>A nau&s;ea and vomiting will be owing to either an acrimonious, putrid, bilious matter, collected in the &s;tomach and prima viae villicating their coats and ir|ritating to excretion, or &s;light convul&s;ive motions
<PB N="10" REF="030167_0008_0FE4F6A086074DF0">
excited in the &s;tomach and neighbouring vi&s;cera, by a determination of the febrile cau&s;e to the&s;e parts; and is be&s;t relieved by emetics, the antimonial and ipecucuanha wines, &amp;c. and afterwards by anodine and cardiac draughts.</P>
<P>Anxiety may be occa&s;ioned by any cau&s;e that may impede the circulation through the lungs, and prevent the free egre&s;s of the blood from the ven|tricles to the heart. This will depend either on in|flammatory or &s;pa&s;modic affections of the lungs; when owing to the former cau&s;e the antiphlogi&s;tic regimen &s;hould be adopted; but when owing to the latter, the warm cordial and anti&s;pa&s;modic line ought then to be pur&s;ued.</P>
<P>The petechiae or exanthemata which often breaks out on the &s;kin in febrile di&s;ea&s;es, may be critical or &s;ymptomatic; in this fever they &s;eem to be &s;ymptoms only, and neither le&s;&s;en or increa&s;e the di&s;ea&s;e, for as the fever abates the petechiae will gradually di&s;ap|pear.</P>
<P>Profu&s;e &s;weating often proves injurious by weak|ening the patient and depriving the blood of its thinner or more aquaous parts; e&s;pecially in the lat|ter end, in weak con&s;titutions or habits, which be|come
<PB N="11" REF="030167_0008_0FE4F6A086074DF0" MS="y">
coliquative and weakening, and tend greatly to &s;ink the patient, and prevent recovery.</P>
<P>Watchings or want of re&s;t in this fever is to be relieved by abating the cau&s;e of re&s;tle&s;ne&s;s; the irri|tation and unu&s;ual contraction and tention of the maninges and nervous <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ibillae of the brain, or by admini&s;tering tho&s;e medicines which allay irritation; opiates in various forms claim the fir&s;t place.</P>
<P>Delirium, if from inflammation, or too increa&s;ed an impetus of the circulation, the antiphlogi&s;tic regimen bids faire&s;t and mo&s;t expedient. If from &s;pa&s;ms and too languid a circulation, which in general is the ca&s;e, it will be found nece&s;&s;ary to keep up the circulation, and re&s;olve the &s;pa&s;ms by cordial, cephalic and anti|&s;pa&s;modic remedies, by bark, mo&s;ch, ca&s;tor, cam|phor, &s;erpentaria and a&s;&s;afoetida, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Convul&s;ions and twitchings of the tendons, the la&s;t &s;tage in fevers, depend on &s;ome irritation or in|jury done the brain or its coverings, from preceding inflammation, &s;uppurations, and the like, al&s;o on ex|treme weakne&s;s from innanition.</P>
<P>The cau&s;es of delyria and pervigilia may prove the cau&s;e of convul&s;ions al&s;o. Warm cordial &s;timulants,
<PB N="12" REF="030167_0009_0FE4F6A219D864E0">
mo&s;ch, ca&s;tor, &s;erpentaria, &amp;c. bid faire&s;t to an&s;wer the de&s;ired end.</P>
<P>This fever may be judged of from the con&s;titution of the patient; a quick, full and ten&s;e pul&s;e, inflam|mation, great heat and thir&s;t, and acute pains in the head, back and limbs, &amp;c. It naturally &s;eems mo&s;t expedient to lower the circulating powers, and to moderate properly the febrile impetus; this is to be effected by evacuations and antiphlogi&s;tics. The an|timonial wine proves &s;erviceable when judiciou&s;ly admini&s;tered in the fir&s;t &s;tage of this fever; the cool|ing diaphoretics and neutral &s;alts, with plenty of light diluting and attenuating drinks, to promote a gentle diaphore&s;is; and about the &s;eventh or eighth day a &s;alutary cri&s;is mo&s;t probably may take place, by &s;weat, turbid urine or loo&s;e &s;tools.</P>
<P>But if at the latter end of this di&s;ea&s;e, the pul&s;e &s;hould flag, the antiphlogi&s;tic medicines mu&s;t be di&s;continued and a cordial regimen &s;ub&s;tituted: and if an intermi&s;&s;ion &s;hould happen&punc; or even a remi&s;&s;ion, with gentle &s;weats and a turbid urine, the bark &s;hould be thrown in as our &s;ole dependence.</P>
<P>It may appear worthy of atttention, that this fever was for the mo&s;t part confined to Europeans and
<PB N="13" REF="030167_0009_0FE4F6A219D864E0">
tran&s;ient per&s;ons&punc; who had arrived here from different parts, or came from other parts or &s;tates in the union. To all &s;uch it proved mo&s;t mortal; and where bleedings was mo&s;t copiou&s;ly had, &s;till le&s;&s;er advantages re&s;ulted.</P>
<P>It may not be improper in this place if we &s;hould make a few remarks on the &s;tate, cour&s;e, and circu|lation of the blood, and at the &s;ame time endeavor to prove how far bleeding may prove u&s;eful or pre|judicial.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, let us ob&s;erve, that it is from the blood all the other juices of the body are &s;ecreted, and le&s;t it &s;hould coagulate or &s;tagnate, is in perpetual mo|tion through every part of the body; and that all its offices depend on the circulation of the blood, which cannot be &s;uppre&s;&s;ed for a few minutes, without being attended with the mo&s;t direful effects. The blood, in its progre&s;&s;ive motion, is conveyed from the heart to the arteries, to all parts of the body, and brought back again by the veins, into the &s;inus veno&s;us; it is then protruded into the right or &s;uperior auricle and ventricle; from the right ven|tricle of the heart it is forced into the pulmonary artery, and after circulating through the lungs, is returned by the pulmonary vein into the left or
<PB N="14" REF="030167_0010_0FE4F6A926D62B50" MS="y">
inferior auricle and ventricle; from the left ventricle it is expelled into the aorta, by who&s;e converging branches it is tran&s;ported from the extremities of the &s;mall arteries&punc; into the na&s;cent or in&s;ipient veins, through them pa&s;&s;es into their larger branches until it arrives at their termination, the heart, from whence it is as before di&s;charged into the arterial &s;y&s;tem, again in a perpetual round to traver&s;e the body.</P>
<P>The blood returning into the cavoe and pulmo|nary veins, and ru&s;hing into the heart by its cavities, will, in &s;uch manner, &s;timulate and affect its &s;en&s;ible nerves and fibres, as to bring it immediately into contraction; if the blood &s;hould become acrid, as from infectious miamata, an impeded excretion of the acrimonious per&s;pirable particles, an ab&s;orbed purulent matter, &amp;c. by its increa&s;ed &s;timulus, it will excite the heart to quicker motion or vibrations, febrile &s;ymptoms mu&s;t take place; or by heat or exerci&s;e of body, which ratify the blood and cau&s;e it to be more determined to the heart; more copi|ou&s;ly the cavities being di&s;tended, its contractions will be more frequently repeated, and the contained fluids expelled with more force, and circulated with an increa&s;ed velocity through the body.</P>
<P>The &s;y&s;tole, or contraction of the heart is imme|diately followed by its relaxation or dia&s;tole, for
<PB N="15" REF="030167_0010_0FE4F6A926D62B50">
the ventricles, by their action, having expelled the blood which they contained into the aorta and pul|monary arteries, their componant fibres will lo&s;e that ten&s;ion and firmne&s;s which the moment before they were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of; at this time the contraction of the arteries begins:&mdash;For the blood being expel|ed from the heart, with a force con&s;iderably exceeds the re&s;i&s;tance they can yield, will dilate them, di&s;|tract their fibres, and may &s;lightly &s;timulate their internal &s;uper&s;icies: This their dilitation and the change, from a le&s;s to that of a greater capacity, thereby occa&s;ioned, is called the pul&s;e, the dia&s;to<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e of which is an expan&s;ion of the artery beyond its natural circumference.</P>
<P>The arteries thus di&s;tended and irritated by the &s;timulus of the forcibly impelled blood, from an inherent contractile power, which is natural and common to them, as con&s;i&s;ting of circular ela&s;ti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> fibres, are immediately con&s;tringed and return to their former diameter, by expre&s;&s;ing a quantity of blood into the venous &s;y&s;tem, proportionable to that with which they had been dilated beyond their or|dinary capacities; and the arteries, by this means, being di&s;engaged from the wave of blood emitted by the ventricles, the di&s;tention and &s;timulus thereby

<P>And this alternate motion and contraction mu&s;t continue, whil&s;t life and the circulation of the blood endure.</P>
<P>From what hath been already advanced, it will appear, that from the pul&s;e may be had much cer|tainty to form a judgment as to the circulating pow|ers; a full &s;trong pul&s;e will denote that the blood abounds in the body, and that it is expelled in large quantities at each contraction of the heart into the arterial &s;y&s;tem; as on the contrary, a weak languid pul&s;e will evince that the blood does not exceed in quantity, nor is it circulated with too great an im|petuo&s;ity through the body. A quick and &s;trong pul&s;e will argue that there is a di&s;po&s;ition to a ple|thora, at the &s;ame time a &s;timulus to excite to more repeated contractions the circulating powers, as a quick and weak pul&s;e will prove that there is rather a deficiency in the quantity and con&s;i&s;tence of the fluids; but at the &s;ame time a &s;timulating acrimony, or a di&s;po&s;ition to irritability in the &s;o|lids them&s;elves, beyond the nece&s;&s;ary bounds.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="030167_0011_0FE4F6AE76D15B10">The actions of the heart and blood-ve&s;&s;els will variou&s;ly affect the circulating fluids, as they are per|formed with a greater or a le&s;&s;er degree of &s;trength and ela&s;ticity.</P>
<P>It is to the&s;e that we are indebted for the con|ver&s;ion of chyle into milk, and at length into blood; and this will vary in its den&s;ity and prin|ciples, according to the &s;trength or weakne&s;s of the &s;y&s;tem of the &s;olids, and the circulation is per|formed with greater or le&s;&s;er vigour.</P>
<P>The &s;trong ela&s;tic ve&s;&s;els act forcibly upon their contained fluids, whence a greater friction and attrition of the blood and ve&s;&s;els again&s;t each other, an increa&s;ed heat and di&s;&s;ipation of the more watery particles, the cra&s;&s;amentum is wrought up to a higher degree of den&s;ity, and abounds in full pro|portion to the &s;erous parts.</P>
<P>The blood and juices in &s;uch con&s;titutions be|come, for this rea&s;on, more den&s;e, compact and vi&s;cid, which will be manife&s;ted by examining the blood of a robu&s;t man who u&s;es much exerci&s;e, which always will appear of this kind.</P>
<P>Even in di&s;ea&s;es in which the vital actions are too much encrea&s;ed, as in ardent fevers and inflamma|tory
<PB N="18" REF="030167_0012_0FE4F6AFFA0FB178">
di&s;ea&s;es the ma&s;s of blood is &s;oon rendered den&s;e and tenaccous, and covered with a phlogi&s;tic lentor.</P>
<P>On the contrary, where the ve&s;&s;els are too weak and the circulation lunguid, the fluids of the body cannot be &s;ufficiently acted upon, or wrought up to a degree of den&s;ity and a proper con&s;i&s;tence, whence the blood has the appearance of a di&s;&s;olved watry fluid, not &s;ufficiently prepared for the &s;trength and nouri&s;hment of the body, or the purpo&s;es of the animal economy, nor circulated with a force &s;uffi|cient to pre&s;erve and maintain the vital heat.</P>
<P>And hence ari&s;es a petuitous lentor in the &s;erum, which under the&s;e circum&s;tances is not &s;ufficiently attenuated, or its particles divided; whence con|cretions in the ve&s;&s;els, cachecxies and innumerable other complaints &s;ucceed. In di&s;ea&s;es likewi&s;e in which the vital actions are depre&s;&s;ed, the pul&s;e is &s;mall and weak, the heat of body le&s;&s;ened, and the texture of the blood di&s;&s;olved with a &s;uperabundant quantity of &s;erum.</P>
<P>To the circulation of the blood rightly and agree|ably performed, we are indebted for life, health, and at la&s;t a gradual decay or old age. But if by
<PB N="19" REF="030167_0012_0FE4F6AFFA0FB178">
any means the blood in its rotatory motion &s;hould be impeded or di&s;turbed, it will become certainly the natural parent of di&s;ea&s;es and of death. So long as the blood and humours are circulated through the ducts and canals of the body, an animal will live, but no &s;ooner does the circulation cea&s;e and become extingui&s;hed, than death &s;ucceeds life. If the circu|lation through every part &s;hould be performed free|ly, aequably moderately and agreeably, &s;o long we remain &s;ound and healthy; but in every di&s;ea&s;e we find the circulation too much increa&s;ed, decrea&s;ed, immoderate or unequal; and morbific cau&s;es in a great mea&s;ure is productive of di&s;ea&s;es, by di&s;turb|ing and impeding the economy of the vital motions, and perverting the &s;ecretions and excretions.</P>
<P>From what has already been advanced on the &s;ub|ject of phlebotomy, when it becomes u&s;eful and ne|ce&s;&s;ary, and when it is to be avoided. For as the circulating powers may be variou&s;ly affected by an evacuation of blood, as &s;ometimes in a plethora, where the ve&s;&s;els are too much di&s;tended, a moderate blood-letting will greatly tend to a free and ea&s;y motion of the fluids. On the contrary, we know of no remedy that will &s;o &s;peedily weaken the powers of nature and impetus of the circulation, and produce
<PB N="20" REF="030167_0013_0FE4F6B18232CE20">
&s;o immediate and univer&s;al a weakne&s;s. For as the influx of the blood into the cavities of the heart ap|pears to be the cau&s;e which excites it to action (as before ob&s;erved) it mu&s;t follow that when the vital fluids is exhau&s;ted, the quantity to be returned to the heart will be le&s;&s;ened, therefore the &s;trength of its mu&s;cular contraction will be impeded. The re|action of the arteries now not &s;ufficiently di&s;tended, will be abated; the circulating powers will flag, and may be reduced to any degree at plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>As bleeding weakens and de&s;troys the action of the ve&s;&s;els and organical parts, upon the &s;ame ac|count it le&s;&s;ens the heat of the body and the motion and impetus of the blood throughout the whole va&s;|cular &s;y&s;tem. For as the friction and attrition of the fluids again&s;t the &s;olids are a chief cau&s;e of heat in living animals, it is evident that by taking away the cau&s;e which excites the heart to action, the force and &s;trength of its mu&s;cular contraction may be dimini&s;h|ed to any degree; and further, it may be &s;aid with certainty, by blood-letting alone we may reduce the motion and impetus of the humours and give &s;o great a check to life and the circulation, when too impe|tuous or beyond mea&s;ure excited in acute di&s;ea&s;es, as to induce a general langour, and by procra&s;tinating
<PB N="21" REF="030167_0013_0FE4F6B18232CE20">
the evacuation, can bring on a deliquium animi, of even death it&s;elf, by which both heat and motion will mo&s;t effectually be &s;topped, and cea&s;e.</P>
<P>It will therefore appear evident what effects are con&s;equent to blood-letting, and tho&s;e can only be from the following:</P>
<P>In a plethora, a moderate bleeding mu&s;t tend to deplate and free the ve&s;&s;els and organical parts when over di&s;tended, with a thick, den&s;e blood, by which means it promotes and increa&s;es the circulation of the fluids, the ea&s;y, free contractions of the arteries, and the ela&s;ticity of the ve&s;&s;els, at the &s;ame time conduces to the attrition, attenuation and motion of the blood; re&s;tores the natural and ready exer|ci&s;e of the body; depraved by a &s;uperabundant quantity of humours, di&s;tending the ve&s;&s;els and clog|ing the circulation, and by tho&s;e means relieves in many and various di&s;ea&s;es, and produces many and great changes in the animal economy.</P>
<P>On the other hand, bleeding will prove of all others the mo&s;t &s;peedy and efficacious to weaken the action and ela&s;ticity of the heart and arteries, and to lower the impetus of the circulation; for in&s;tance, in acute inflammatory di&s;ea&s;es, where the blood is
<PB N="22" REF="030167_0014_0FE4F6BA429AA810">
too rapidly and impetuou&s;ly propelled, will afford an immediate and &s;peedy relief, but if profu&s;ely, in|judiciou&s;ly and un&s;ea&s;onably u&s;ed, where there is neither a real plethora or increa&s;ed impetus of the circulation, by lowering the vis vitae, will retard the cure of many di&s;ea&s;es, and at the &s;ame time relax the &s;olids and le&s;&s;en the bodily heat; retards the circu|lation, dimini&s;hes the &s;trength, di&s;&s;olves and thins the fluids, and is productive of various evils, by the body becoming weak, infirm and cachectic. In fine, in all ca&s;es from a relaxed &s;tate of the &s;olids, a di&s;|&s;olved &s;tate of blood and a weak languid circulati|on, blood-letting &s;hould be avoided, as increa&s;ing all the &s;ymptoms and contrary to all the intentions of cure.</P>
<P>Much hath been advanced on this &s;ubject, and it now becomes nece&s;&s;ary in the la&s;t place to ob&s;erve that in mo&s;t &s;ea&s;ons, about the autumn of the year, fevers of the putrid and inflammatory cla&s;&s;es, manife&s;t them&s;elves in South-Carolina, which, according to the &s;tate of the weather become more or le&s;s violent and prevalent. It would therefore be found mo&s;t ad|vi&s;eable in per&s;ons coming from Europe or el&s;ewhere, not to adventure here during tho&s;e months, or any but from the middle of October until the fir&s;t part of
<PB N="23" REF="030167_0014_0FE4F6BA429AA810">
June, as in a great mea&s;ure they might become ha|bituated to the climate, and have le&s;s to dread from the &s;udden and frequent tran&s;itions &s;o common here.</P>
<P>Tran&s;ient per&s;ons who come and &s;tay but a &s;hort time, have not that danger to dread, and tho&s;e who arrive here in future, would find it infinitely &s;ervice|able and beneficial to them, immediately on their arrival, to make the proper evacuations by emetics, cathartics, and other nece&s;&s;ary evacuations or excre|tions, according as the habits of body or con&s;tituti|ons re&s;pectively, might &s;eem mo&s;t expedient.</P>
