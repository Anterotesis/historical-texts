<P>3d Art. of the Bill of Rights of Virginia &mdash;"That Government is, or ought to be, in&s;tituted for the common benefit, protection and &s;ecurity, of the Peo|ple, Nation, or Community; of all the various modes and forms of Government, that is be&s;t, which is ca|pable of producing the greate&s;t degree of happine&s;s and &s;afety, and is mo&s;t effectually &s;ecured again&s;t the danger of mal-admini&s;tration; and that when any Go|vernment &s;hall be found inadequate or contrary to the&s;e purpo&s;es, a majority of the community hath an indubitable, unalienable, and indefea&s;ible right, to re|form, alter, or aboli&s;h it, in &s;uch manner as &s;hall be judged mo&s;t conducive to the public weal.</P>

<HEAD>REMARKS, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I. ARTICLE 1&s;t of the BILL of RIGHTS.</HEAD>
<P>"ALL men are by nature equally free and in|dependent, and have certain inherent rights of which when they enter into a &s;tate of &s;ociety, they cannot by any compact, deprive or dive&s;t their po&s;terity; namely, the enjoyment of life and liber|ty, with the means of acquiring and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing pro|perty, and pur&s;uing and obtaining happine&s;s and &s;afety."</P>
<P>This, my countrymen, was the language of Vir|ginia a&s;&s;embled in full and free convention in 1776, &mdash;when the recent experience of arbitrary power awakened in every patriotic brea&s;t a determined oppo&s;ition to De&s;poti&s;m,&mdash;when Americans had &s;aid they would be FREE. How forcible the ex|pre&s;&s;ion&mdash;how pointed the &s;entiments this article contains!&mdash;It will ever reflect honor upon tho&s;e worthy patriots who compo&s;ed it, and upon the people who&s;e exertions in its &s;upport proved their attachment to its principles&mdash;who under the im|pre&s;&s;ions of &s;uch principles fought and bled &s;uc|ce&s;sfully.</P>
<P>Yes, "all men by nature are equally free and independent," and the hi&s;tory of mankind evinces
<PB N="6" REF="047801_0004_10249769B258DEC8">that all di&s;tinctions, titles and en&s;igns of royalty have originated in the &s;lavery of one party and de&s;|poti&s;m of another. While the principles of liber|ty were well under&s;tood, mankind pre&s;erved their freedom and independence. But when tyrants ro&s;e up and would en&s;lave the world, they began by taking advantage of the &s;uper&s;tition of the croud, by locking up the fountains of wi&s;dom and cover|ing the human mind with a veil of ignorance.&mdash; They knew the force of light and truth, and by degrees &s;ub&s;tituted in their place ignorance and er|ror. They per&s;uaded to conque&s;t and rapine, and introduced the cu&s;tom of rendering neighbouring nations, tributary. Soon after the cu&s;tom or ma|king &s;laves of the conquered obtained, and this was attended with the mo&s;t pernicious effects. Accu&s;tomed to behold others in a &s;tate of va&s;&s;al|age, the genuine principles of liberty began to be corrupted. Mankind &s;oon doubted whether liber|ty was e&s;&s;ential to happine&s;s; and the poorer cla&s;s often &s;old them&s;elves. By the habit of a&s;&s;ociating together, the &s;ervile &s;pirit encrea&s;ed. A few by degrees became po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of greater power, which encrea&s;ed as their wealth was augmented, till at length they ruled with de&s;potic &s;way. The multi|tude ignorant and inattentive glided imperceptibly to the lowe&s;t &s;tate of va&s;&s;alage, and not a trace of their former &s;ituation remained. Tyrants imagin|ing them&s;elves &s;ecure, proceeded to more open and violent acts of de&s;poti&s;m. Sometimes indeed a po|et would &s;ing the lo&s;t liberty of his countrymen, and in plaintive &s;trains bemoan their unhappy &s;i|tuation;
<PB N="7" REF="047801_0005_1024976B3655AB00">but he was obliged to u&s;e figures and me|taphors, and couch his meaning under &s;uch ob|&s;cure repre&s;entations, as could be under&s;tood but by few, and were therefore totally u&s;ele&s;s to the generality of mankind.</P>
<P>Here then we &s;ee the great importance of a ge|neral diffu&s;ion of knowledge, and the great dan|ger of tolerating &s;lavery in any country.</P>
<P>Could any man have &s;uppo&s;ed the &s;tate which had adopted this as the fir&s;t article in her Bill of Rights, "all men are hy nature equally free and independent," &s;hould not before this time have provided for the emancipation of &s;laves? That the &s;tate which in the preamble to her con&s;titution &s;tates as an in&s;tance of royal mi&s;rule, "prompting our Negroes to ri&s;e up in arms again&s;t us, tho&s;e very Negroes whom by an inhuman u&s;e of his ne|gative, he hath refu&s;ed us permi&s;&s;ion to exclude by law," &s;hould have been nineteen years inde|pendent, and yet pa&s;&s;ed no effectual act for the abolition of &s;lavery? Is it material to &s;tate in a bill of rights that all men by nature are equally free and independent, and yet &s;hall one half of the community be continued in &s;lavery? Have all men certain inherent rights, of which when they enter into a &s;tate of &s;ociety they cannot deprive or dive&s;t their po&s;terity, and &s;hall &s;ome be born &s;laves? Have all men a right to the enjoyment of life and liberty, the means of acquiring and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing pro|perty, and &s;hall &s;ome be neither free, acquire pro|perty, nor po&s;&s;e&s;s it? Have all a right to be tried by an impartial jury of twelve men of their vicin|age,
<PB N="8" REF="047801_0006_1024976D3381A370">and &s;hall four ju&s;tices of the peace con&s;titute a court, to try and condemn one half of the com|munity?&mdash;And is not this the &s;ituation of the &s;laves in Virginia? Her legi&s;lature &s;uffers it to be &s;o; yea they refu&s;e permi&s;&s;ion to bring in a bill for emancipation: My Countrymen, let us not make a hypocritical declaration of a Bill of Rights.</P>
<P>The advantages re&s;ulting to Virginia from the emancipation of &s;laves may be e&s;timated by a com|pari&s;on of her &s;ituation with that of the neighbour|ing &s;tates who have aboli&s;hed &s;lavery.&mdash;I leave the reader to form his own conclu&s;ions by making the compari&s;on him&s;elf.</P>
<P>The di&s;advantages attendant on the toleration of &s;lavery are numerous, obvious to every ob&s;erver, and in every man's mouth. It is injurious to eve|ry intere&s;t civil and religious, pernicious to the morals of the people, promotive of arrogance, in|dolence, impatience and extravagance,&mdash;It impo|veri&s;hes the community, promotes di&s;tinctions odi|ous and abominable, de&s;troys the prime of our &s;oil, continues an expen&s;ive and injurious trade, pre|vents the encouragement of manufactures, hinders our citizens from excelling in any of the u&s;eful arts of life, gives our country a rude uncouth appear|ance, deprives us of the advantage of faithful &s;er|vants, who&s;e intere&s;t would be a &s;pur to hone&s;ty and diligence, and upon the whole, is the ruin and di&s;grace of Virginia and her neighbouring South|ern States.</P>
<P>I am aware that this is not a popular &s;ubject, but I am equally convinced that if it is not &s;oon
<PB N="9" REF="047801_0007_102497709E500E38">the language of our legi&s;lature we may ju&s;tly ex|pect greater calamities than we have yet experi|enced.&mdash;How impolitic to have from their very &s;i|tuation an enemy in the heart of our country!&mdash; While they are &s;laves their &s;ervile condition will render them di&s;affected to their rulers. Can the &s;laves of a de&s;pot love? They may FEAR, but never can they LOVE.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II. ART. 2d of the BILL of RIGHTS.</HEAD>
<P>"THAT all power is ve&s;ted in, and con&s;e|quently derived from the people; that magi&s;trates, are their tru&s;tees and &s;ervants, and at all times amenable to them."</P>
<P>Let us examine how far the Con&s;titution cor|re&s;ponds with this article.&mdash;The 15th article of the Con&s;titution &s;tates and provides, That the Governor with the advice of the Privy Council &s;hall appoint ju&s;tices of the peace for the counties, and in ca&s;e of vacancies or a nece&s;&s;ity of encrea&s;|ing their number hereafter, &s;uch appointments to be made on the recommendation of the county courts&mdash;The clerks &s;hall be appointed by the re|&s;pective county courts&mdash;The &s;heriffs and coroners &s;hall be nominated by the re&s;pective county courts approved by the governor, with the advice of the privy council, and commi&s;&s;ioned by the governor. The ju&s;tices &s;hall appoint con&s;tables, &amp;c. &amp;c.&mdash; Here then are ju&s;tices appointed by a governor&mdash;
<PB N="10" REF="047801_0008_10249773CD73C960">Does this corre&s;pond with the 2d article of the bill of rights, which &s;tates that all power is ve&s;ted in and derived from the people? The governor creates ju&s;tices, the ju&s;tices clerks, &s;heriffs, con|&s;tables, and new ju&s;tices&mdash;Has this the appear|ance of keeping the legi&s;lative, executive, and ju|diciary branches of government &s;eparate and di&s;|tinct, as the 3d article of the con&s;titution pro|vides? (except that ju&s;tices of the peace &s;hall be eligible to either hou&s;e of A&s;&s;embly.)</P>
<P>Here is a power created by a governor after|wards to create it&s;elf&mdash;which, may make laws, for it may con&s;titute a majority of the legi&s;lature&mdash;&s;et upon the bench to determine upon the&s;e laws, ap|point its own clerk to record its deci&s;ions, create its own &s;heriff to &s;erve its executions, its coroners &amp;c.&mdash;Is not this blending the three powers which &s;hould be kept &s;eperate and di&s;tinct?</P>
<P>Of what u&s;e to &s;ay all power is derived from the people? Let us &s;ee what degree a magi&s;trate on the County Court bench is removed from the peo|ple. 1. The people elect the A&s;&s;embly. 2. The A&s;&s;embly the governor. 3. The governor ap|points the fir&s;t &s;et of magi&s;trates. 4. The ma|gi&s;trate appoints his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, for recommenda|tions are &s;eldom refu&s;ed&mdash;Thus in the 4th degree from the people we come to a ju&s;tice of the peace&mdash; two degrees farther off than pre&s;ident of the Unit|ed States&mdash;now is this comportable with all power being derived from the people?&mdash;The very idea is ridiculous&mdash;Cou&s;ins in the fourth degree of con|&s;anguinity but &s;eldom claim kin.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="047801_0009_1024977578212FB8">
Enquire what is the effect of this &s;trange med|ley? You will be told a parcel of ignorant beings are placed on the bench who know little of law and it is to be feared often too little of the purport of their title; you will be told of lazy, ignorant drun|ken clerks, and bankrupt &s;heriffs, as the &s;aying is, like prie&s;t like people. You will be told of ma|gi&s;trates on the bench drunk, deciding contrary to rea&s;on, law and every principle of equity&mdash;Hence come appeals after appeals, and more iniquity and litigation than I can enumerate.</P>
<P>But Says the Bill of Rights "magi&s;trates are the tru&s;tees and &s;ervants of the people, and at all times amenable to them."</P>
<P>How are you to impeach a magi&s;trate of the County Court? by the General A&s;&s;embly; yes &amp; of that branch of government they may con&s;titute the majority. How then is the matter likely to terminate? Boa&s;t then no longer of a Bill of Rights.</P>

<P>[Read at large in the title page]</P>
<P>This article is honorable to the convention who framed it and is the great re&s;torative of a defective con&s;titution.

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. ART. 4.</HEAD>
<P>That no man or &s;et of men, are entitled to ex|clu&s;ive or &s;eperate emoluments, or privileges from the community, but in con&s;ideration of public &s;er|vices; which not being de&s;cendible, neither ought the offices of magi&s;trate, legi&s;lator, or judge to be hereditary.&mdash;Then I humbly conceive magi&s;trates &s;hould not have the power of recommending others to that office.

<P>ART. 5th. That the excutive and legi&s;lative pow|ers of the &s;tate &s;hould be kept &s;eperate and di&s;tinct from the Judiciary, &amp;c.

<HEAD>CHAH. V. ART. 5th of the CONSTITUTION,</HEAD>
<P>Provides two repre&s;entatives for each counts, &amp;c.</P>
<P>It has long been matter of complaint that the &s;tate is unequally repre&s;ented in con&s;equence of this
<PB N="13" REF="047801_0011_1024977AC731E758">article of the con&s;titution. Some counties are more than one-third larger than others, &s;ome have one-third &s;ewer, who are entitled to vote&mdash;But a &s;mall county has the &s;ame number of repre&s;entatives&mdash; the &s;malle&s;t with the large&s;t in the &s;tate&mdash;100 free|holders &s;end as many delegates to the a&s;&s;embly as 500&mdash;and as the proportion of &s;maller counties is &s;omething above that of the larger&mdash;one-third on|ly of the &s;tate may pa&s;s a law, to which the re|maining two-thirds may be oppo&s;ed. So that a minority of the people may rule.</P>
<P>This evil might be remedied, if the people would exerci&s;e their right to revi&s;e the con&s;titu|tion. The &s;tate might be divided into di&s;tricts, and each di&s;trict might &s;end one or two repre&s;en|tatives according to the number of voters. Cer|tainly an equal repre&s;entation is matter of con&s;e|quence and might ea&s;ily be procured. I &s;ubmit the matter to my countrymen.</P>

<P>Article the 11th of the con&s;titution, provides for the election of a privy council of &s;tate, and that they &s;hall have a &s;um of money divided among them, &amp;c. This has long appeared to me a u&s;e|le&s;s branch of our government, and might I think be di&s;pen&s;ed with and the expen&s;e &s;aved.

Does it requite eight privy councillors and a governor, to prevent the importation of the &s;mall-pox or yellow-fever? to i&s;&s;ue a proclamation to make ve&s;&s;els &s;u&s;pected perform quarantine forty days, to pardon now and then a hor&s;e-thief, to commi&s;&s;ion a county &s;urveyor, militia officer, &amp;c?</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII.</HEAD>
<P>Article 14th of the Con&s;titution provides for the appointment of the court of Appeals.</P>
<P>Now of this court there are five judges, while the General court at pre&s;ent con&s;i&s;ts of ten&mdash;Suppo&s;e then, the pre&s;ent General court was made a court of Appeals? Would there not be a better chance for wi&s;dom among the ten? Perhaps &s;ome one might object that the appeals are carried from the di&s;trict Courts, and this would be bringing the &s;ame cau&s;e before two at lea&s;t of the &s;ame judges&mdash;ju&s;t as if I were to appeal from Dick to Richard.&mdash;This objection is ea&s;ily obviated&mdash;Let the court of ap|peals require &s;even judges, then any cau&s;e which
<PB N="15" REF="047801_0013_102499DCA47BDFD0">might be brought in that court, from any particu|lar di&s;trict might be tried by &s;even different judges &mdash;becau&s;e tho&s;e who pre&s;ided in that di&s;trict and tri|ed the cau&s;e fir&s;t, might retire if the whole ten judges were pre&s;ent, and have an odd judge to keep them company.</P>
<P>But as &s;ome people are fond of putting difficul|ties in the way&mdash;It might be a&s;ked what would you do with ca&s;es referred by the di&s;trict Judges to the General court? The an&s;wer is equally obvious and rea&s;onable. Let this be the final determina|tion of &s;uch ca&s;es.&mdash;This would &s;ave a good deal of expen&s;e in the appeal bu&s;ine&s;s, and I doubt not but that the deci&s;ion would be as &s;trictly legal.</P>
<P>By di&s;carding the pre&s;ent court of Appeals we &s;hould &s;ave 5000 dollars, which if added to the 6667 before &s;aved will amount to 11,687 dollars&mdash; a pretty round &s;um; a peny &s;aved and wi&s;dom gained is &s;omething worth while.

Every one will ea&s;ily perceive that the above cited act of A&s;&s;embly does not cor|re&s;pond with this principle of Monte&s;quiu&mdash;"That Liberty is favored by the nature and proportion of puni&s;hments." For it makes the lower &s;pecies of crimes equal with the higher, and puni&s;hes with|out di&s;tinction the hor&s;e theif and the murderer.</P>
<P>The &s;ame writer &s;peaking of the power of pu|ni&s;hment &s;ays, "Experience &s;hews that in coun|tries remarkable for the lenity of penal laws, the &s;pirit of the inhabitants is as much affected by them, as in other countries by &s;everer puni&s;hments. The imagination grows accu&s;tomed to the one as well as the other."</P>
<P>Again when there is a breach of &s;ecurity with re|&s;pect to property, there may be &s;ome rea&s;ons for in|flicting capital puni&s;hments. But it would perhaps be much better and more natural, that crimes com|mitted again&s;t the &s;ecurity of property &s;hould be puni&s;hed with the lo&s;s of property; and this ought to be the ca&s;e if men's fortunes were common or equal. But as tho&s;e who have none, are generally readie&s;t to attack the property of others, it has been found nece&s;&s;ary in&s;tead of a pecuniary to &s;ub|&s;titute corporal puni&s;hments. I join him in &s;aying, that, what he has here advanced is extremely fa|vorable to the liberty of the citizen, and is founded in nature. Experience al&s;o proves that corporal puni&s;hments of the le&s;&s;er degree, have a &s;tronger tendency to prevent the commi&s;&s;ion of the&s;e crimes
<PB N="19" REF="047801_0017_102499E5E9553128">than tho&s;e of a capital nature&mdash;In many places where the citizens of this common wealth have been infe&s;ted with hor&s;e thieves, though every exertion was made to bring them to ju&s;tice, and &s;ome &s;uffered death, others continued the&s;e prac|tices till the introduction of Lynch's law. The free exerci&s;e of this, though incon&s;i&s;tent with the principles of liberty, and often managed in too arbitrary a manner, has extirpated the&s;e pe&s;ts from neighbourhoods and rendered this property before uncertain, &s;afe and &s;ecure. I would by no means be under&s;tood to recommend this mode of pro|ceedure, but rather to in&s;i&s;t upon a fair and legal trial by the twelve jurors, and after full conviction of guilt, to u&s;e liberally the la&s;h and &s;ame length of confinement, or any puni&s;hment &s;hort of death which may be deemed &s;ufficient.</P>
<P>What &s;ome advance, viz. that a man who would &s;teal a hor&s;e can never afterwards make a good citizen, I am by no means willing to admit&mdash; There has been many a brave &s;oldier who&s;e back bore the la&s;ting records of the Cat with nine tails &mdash;and there have been &s;ome in&s;tances of pardoned criminals becoming u&s;eful citizens.</P>
<P>A man de&s;erves death, who has attempted or perpetrated the crime of murder. Life for life is con&s;i&s;tent with rea&s;on. In this ca&s;e the puni&s;h|ment of death is the remedy as it were of a &s;ick &s;ociety. But &s;urely, le&s;&s;er crimes call for, le&s;&s;er puni&s;hments. The lo&s;s of a hor&s;e can ruin com|paratively but few. But he who is deprived of life or liberty has lo&s;t all that is dear and va|luable.</P>

<P>IN the fir&s;t part of the&s;e remarks, I was nece&s;|&s;arily led to &s;hew the incon&s;i&s;tency of tollerating &s;lavery, when the bill of rights had declared all men by nature equally free and independent&mdash;I &s;hall here re&s;ume the &s;ubject and endeavor to illu&s;trate the evil more clearly and if po&s;&s;ible recommend a remedy.</P>
<P>Monte&s;quieu,&mdash;&s;peaking of &s;lavery &s;ays, "The &s;tate of &s;lavery is bad. It is neither u&s;eful to the ma&s;ter nor the &s;lave; not to the &s;lave, becau&s;e he can do nothing from a motive of virtue; not to the ma&s;ter becau&s;e by having too great an authority over his &s;laves, he in&s;en&s;ibly accu&s;toms him&s;elf to the want of all moral virtues, and from hence grows fierce, ha&s;ty, &s;evere, choleric, voluptuous and cruel. In moderate (by which he means re|publican) &s;tates, it is a point of the highe&s;t impor|tance,
<PB N="22" REF="047801_0020_102499ED82BECA10">that there &s;hould not be a great number of &s;laves. The political Liberty of tho&s;e &s;tates adds to the value of civil Liberty and he who is depriv|ed of the latter is al&s;o deprived of the former. He &s;ees the happine&s;s of a &s;ociety of which, he is not &s;o much as a member; he &s;ees the &s;ecurity of others fenced by laws him&s;elf without any protection. He &s;ees that his ma&s;ter has a &s;oul which can en|large it&s;elf, while his own is con&s;trained to &s;ubmit to continual depre&s;&s;ion. Nothing can more a&s;&s;i|milate a man to a bea&s;t, than living among free|men him&s;elf a &s;lave. Such people as the&s;e are the natural enemies of the &s;ociety and their number mu&s;t be dangerous." I grant you this is a &s;evere repre&s;entation of the ca&s;e; &s;everal acts have pa&s;&s;ed tending to mitigate the &s;tate of &s;lavery in Virginia. But &s;till I mu&s;t adopt the language of Sterne,&mdash; But &s;till &s;lavery how&s;o'eer di&s;gui&s;ed, thou art a bit|ter draught.' I have quoted enough to demon&s;trate the evil&mdash;Let us aim at a remedy.</P>
<P>Paley in his Moral Philo&s;ophy has this remark &mdash;"The great revolution which has taken place in the We&s;tern World may po&s;&s;ibly conduce (and who knows but that it was de&s;igned?) to accele|rate the fall of this abominable tyranny (alluding to &s;lavery;) and now that this conte&s;t and the pa&s;&s;ions which attended it are no more, there may &s;ucceed perhaps a &s;ea&s;on for reflecting&mdash;whether a legi&s;lature which had &s;o long lent its a&s;&s;i&s;tance to the &s;upport of an in&s;titution replete with human mi&s;ery, was fit to be tru&s;ted with an empire, the mo&s;t exten&s;ive that ever obtained in any age, or quarter of the world."</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="047801_0021_102499EF05C6F548">
He alludes here and with great ju&s;tice, to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> legi&s;lature, the authors of this evil; and well may we conclude from &s;ad experience of the evil, that they were not fit to be tru&s;ted. No doubt this excelent writer had a deep &s;en&s;e of the evils introduced by &s;lavery, and it was natural enough to &s;uppo&s;e, that a people who had bravely re&s;i&s;ted Briti&s;h Tyranny and e&s;tabli&s;hed their Independence, would have aboli&s;hed this in&s;titution. And I would now &s;up|po&s;e that it will yet be the ca&s;e.&mdash;Several efforts have been made and I doubt not would have been attended with &s;ucce&s;s, but for this great objection. The di&s;charging of slaves from all obligation to obey their ma&s;ters, which would be the con&s;e|quence of a general emancipation, would have no better effect, than to let loo&s;e one half of mankind upon the other. There is however one &s;afe me|thod &s;till remaining. I mean a gradual emancipa|tion carried on by provi&s;ions of law and under the protection of civil government. In this way the Greek and Roman slavery was aboli&s;hed&mdash;by this method the Northern States have &s;ome of them ef|fected the de&s;irable purpo&s;e&mdash;and it is hoped by the&s;e means, this odious in&s;titution will be bani&s;h|ed from Virginia.</P>

<P>That the government &s;hould be revi&s;ed is obvi|ous to all who think of the matter. That the peo|ple have a right to do &s;o, the bill of rights has very judiciously declared&mdash;and that the exerci&s;e of
<PB N="24" REF="047801_0022_102499F1380EDC50">this right cannot be attended with any bad con&s;|quences, I think that love of Liberty which per|vades the brea&s;t of every real Virginian is &s;uffici|ent &s;ecurity. To &s;ecure the happine&s;s of the people is the object which &s;hould ever be kept in view. But that in many ca&s;es under the pre&s;ent con&s;titu|tion this is not &s;ufficiently &s;ecured, many have been a long time convinced. The admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice under the pre&s;ent &s;y&s;tem of County courts is a proof of this. The evils re&s;ulting from the local &s;ituation of the county court magi&s;trates, are &s;erious and alarming.&mdash;However upright they may be, yet the power of prejudice often may lead them a&s;tray, for <HI>"humanum e&s;t errare."</HI> A particular acquaintance with the parties litigant, a repre&s;en|tation of the ca&s;e by one concerned, the load&s;tone of con&s;anguinity, may incline the mind &s;o far as to prevent an impartial deci&s;ion. Indeed a good man man feel him&s;elf embarra&s;&s;ed in a &s;ituation &s;o very delicate.</P>
<P>The ignorance of the magi&s;trates mu&s;t prevent, them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> from knowing what judgment to give. And as they have no immediate reward for their trouble they cannot be expected to be&s;tow time in &s;tudying the laws of the land &s;o as to be qualified to give an opinion &s;trictly legal.</P>
<P>Their being made eligible to either hou&s;e of a&s;|&s;embly and returning again to their judicial capaci|ty, and perhaps in mediately to exerci&s;e the office of &s;heriff, is allowing them priveleges and ex|po&s;ing them to temptations, which may be attend|ed with dangerous con&s;equences. It is certainly
<PB N="25" REF="047801_0023_102499F31425E1F8">incon&s;i&s;tent with every principle of democracy.</P>
<P>That they &s;hould nominate &s;heriffs and appoint clerks is by no means favorable to the liberty and &s;ecurity of the people.</P>
<P>But as it is doing nothing to point out evils without aiming at a remedy, with much diffidence I pre&s;ume to offer one.</P>
<P>To remedy the want of knowledge at pre&s;ent too apparent, let a law be pa&s;&s;ed or the con&s;titution pro|vide, that all judges of inferior courts &s;hould pa&s;s an examination touching their legal knowledge be|fore three judges of the &s;uperior Courts, that they be appointed by the general A&s;&s;embly upon their producing a certificate of their examination &s;tating that they were acquainted with the laws of their country. That previous to their appointment they &s;hould be recommended by a jury of their vicinage as per&s;ons of good moral character.</P>
<P>To remedy the evils re&s;ulting from their local &s;i|tuation, let the &s;tate be divided into twelve di&s;tricts or more if found nece&s;&s;ary, and let them be &s;tiled circuits.&mdash;Let one judge appointed in the manner already propo&s;ed (or any other mode better calcu|lated to an&s;wer the purpo&s;e) pre&s;ide in a di&s;trict, ride to the different Courthou&s;es, &s;it &s;o many days twice or thrice a year, and be &s;ent to a differ|ent circuit every &s;ucceeding court. Let the&s;e be &s;til|ed circuit Judges and have an adequate &s;alary&mdash;&s;up|po&s;e one thou&s;and Dollars each. By an ea&s;y calcu|lation this money may be rai&s;ed without any addi|tional Tax.</P>

<P>I beg leave here to &s;ubjoin a few more remarks of a general nature.&mdash;</P>
<P>Political happine&s;s mu&s;t re&s;ult from political freedom&mdash;and every law which tends to pre&s;erve the liberty and happine&s;s of the people &s;hould be immediately adopted and regularly executed.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="047801_0026_102499FA8763AD88">
It is remarked generally by &s;trangers that the people in the Northern States, are in a much better &s;ituation, than the Virginians and their Southern neighbors. That they improve much more rapid|ly in the knowledge of every u&s;eful art and inventi|on, and by the&s;e means become more independent and re&s;pectable. That there is &s;urely a difference cannot be denied. Many cau&s;es con&s;pire to bring it about. Among the&s;e it may not be improper to mention, the defects too apparent in our Con&s;titu|tion and Laws&mdash;The toleration of &s;lavery&mdash;and the exten&s;ive &s;cale on which we continue the Tobac|co trade. To prove this la&s;t cau&s;e an evil, I &s;olicit attention to the following particulars.&mdash;</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be the prime of our &s;oil which is allotted to the culture of this plant. The con&s;equence is that our lands are cut and cleared up wherever the &s;oil promi&s;es a flouri&s;hing crop. In good &s;trong land the be&s;t timber is generally found&mdash;But this is &s;acrificed to the main object, and in profli|gate abundance committed to the flames. Hence &s;o much of our land is rendered in a great mea&s;ure u&s;ele&s;s.&mdash;Ha&s;tily cut down&mdash;injudiciou&s;ly tended, in a few years whole tracts (where the country is hilly) are &s;wept into the vallies and covered with immen&s;e bodies of &s;and, which it would require the work of ages to remove. From the wa&s;te of timber comes the nece&s;&s;ity of importing many arti|cles from foreign countries or neighboring &s;tates, which as the &s;aying is, co&s;t more than they come to; a &s;aying &s;o much in vogue as to need no ex|plication.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="047801_0027_102499FD697FA458">
The time and trouble expended in the culture of Tobacco is another object worthy notice.&mdash; Spring, Summer, Fall and Winter, prove little enough for the immen&s;e toil&mdash;Hence often it hap|pens, that too little provender is made for the &s;up|port of &s;tock&mdash;and it is no uncommon thing in travelling through Virginia in the months of February and March, to have the tender feelings of humanity tortured with the appearance of hor&s;es, hogs and cattle, hardly able to creep upon the earth.&mdash;</P>
<P>Picture to your imagination a valuable hor&s;e, without fle&s;h on his bones, or &s;kin on his back, after &s;weating in the plough a whole &s;ummer,&mdash;no or without &s;trength to walk or &s;kin to keep the yoke from his fle&s;h&mdash;But as the appearance of mi&s;ery even in the brute creation, is torturing to the generous mind, &s;o is the de&s;cription,&mdash;The&s;e are the fruits of Tobacco.</P>
<P>Attend al&s;o to the price it bears when carried to market, if haply it be not refu&s;ed.&mdash;From twenty-four to thirty &s;hillings an hundred weight is a liberal calculation, and is this &s;ufficient to recom|pence the direful drudgery? Let every one be his own judge.</P>
<P>Will any man &s;ay, it becomes nece&s;&s;ary, this alone will command ca&s;h&mdash;and enable to pay taxes, &amp;c.&mdash;This is fal&s;e rea&s;oning&mdash;The culture of Wheat would be far more profitable&mdash;There is no danger as &s;ome &s;uppo&s;e of over&s;tocking the market. Rather the more Wheat we make, the better price we &s;hall get. When other nations meet with a rea|dy
<PB N="30" REF="047801_0028_102499FFA3773170">&s;upply from the plenty in our markets&mdash;it will then be an object worth notice and our ports will be crouded with &s;hips to carry it away.</P>
<P>Another thing to be remarked, the exten&s;ive culture of Tobacco is a heavy tax upon the people. It &s;ubjects them to the nece&s;&s;ity of depending more upon foreign markets than home manufactures. And in proportion as a country is obliged to depend upon fereign in&s;tead of internal re&s;ources, are they poorer and le&s;s independent.</P>
<P>Perhaps there is no country more ble&s;&s;ed as to air, &s;oil produce, &amp;c. than Virginia&mdash;But by rea|&s;on of impolitic management the&s;e ble&s;&s;ings are but little improved. A ho&s;t of foreign merchants, take advantage of our imprudence, pour in their toys and fripperies and reduce our &s;hort-&s;ighted citizens to a &s;tate of debt and embarra&s;sment. My coun|trymen cannot forget the immen&s;e &s;ums due Briti&s;h merchants and if they reflect but a moment, they will lament with me the &s;lavery and difficulties un|der which many of our citizens, are at this moment laboring.&mdash;Picture to your&s;elves the hundreds, who mu&s;t part with hou&s;e and home and every atom <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> property to &s;atisfy greedy creditors.&mdash;But all this has re&s;ulted from depending on the Tobacco trade. Let this bu&s;ine&s;s be continued but a few years longer&mdash;Briti&s;h merchants have nothing more to do, but credit largely, by and by bring about a ward&s;hip them&s;elves to England and after Seven, Eight, or Ten years &s;truggle make a peace, upon condition, that all their debts &s;hall be paid with in|tere&s;t&mdash;After a few years peace, they have only to

Make only half the Tobacco&mdash;try this a few years&mdash;I doubt not but the price will be double what it now is, and from the exten&s;ive culture of wheat and a proper attention to manufactures our citizens in a tenfold better &s;ituation.</P>

<P>ANOTHER remark founded in truth, is that Education does not flouri&s;h with the Virginians, in proportion to the advantages they enjoy. This is al&s;o owing in a great mea&s;ure to the early habits we form of expecting our &s;upport from Africans. Nece&s;&s;ity is the mother of invention and humility the road to knowledge.</P>
<P>There is a wide field open here for the exertions of our legi&s;lature&mdash;A much more commendable employment, than impo&s;ing penalties on tho&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;ting a poor Negro, who &s;uppo&s;ing him&s;elf en|titled to freedom appeals to courts of law and is unfortunately ca&s;t.

<P>The e&s;tabli&s;hment of Colleges and Free-Schools in every di&s;trict would tend to a more general dif|fu&s;&s;ion of knowledge, by rendering it more ea&s;y to obtain. This in a &s;hort time would produce a

We &s;hould &s;oon have our hou&s;es of A&s;|&s;embly, filled with men of political de&s;cernment&mdash; and be no longer reduced to the nece&s;&s;ity of elect|ing many who are totally uninformed.&mdash;Our courts of law would be &s;upplied with men of legal infor|mation and we &s;hould no longer complain of the ignorance of county court magi&s;trates.&mdash;Our bar would be graced with men of profound erudi|tion in the &s;cience of law and juri&s;prudence, in&s;tead of being pe&s;tered with tri&s;ting Quibblers.&mdash; We &s;hould have Phy&s;icians &s;killed in the nature of di&s;ea&s;es, the con&s;truction of the human frame and the various medicines &s;uited to the &s;ituation of the &s;ick in the room of pert Quacks, affecting a look of &s;agacity to grace an enormous account. Our pulpits would be di&s;tingui&s;hed by the abilities of divines &s;killed in the wi&s;dom of revelation, and ca|pable of refuting the errors which abound&mdash;in|&s;tead of unmeaning declaimers be&s;et with narrow prejudice.</P>
<P>It is in a republican government (&s;ays Monte&s;|quieu) that the whole power of education is re|quired&mdash;The laws of education in a republic &s;hould have virtue as their object. This virtue may be defined the love of the laws and our country. As this love requires a con&s;tant preference of public to private intere&s;t, it is the &s;ource of all political virtues&mdash;for they are nothing more than this very preference it&s;elf. This love is particularly nece&s;|&s;ary in Democracies. In the&s;e alone the govern|ment is intre&s;ted to private citizens. Now go|vernment
<PB N="33" REF="047801_0031_10249A04DFBF4220">is like every thing el&s;e, to pre&s;erve it we mu&s;t love it. Has it ever been heard that Kings were not &s;end of monarchy, or that de&s;potic princes hated arbitrary power?</P>
<P>Every thing therefore depends on e&s;tabli&s;hing this love in a republic; and to in&s;pire it ought to be the principal bu&s;ine&s;s of Education.</P>
<P>Here then we may very ju&s;tly infer the impolicy of importing teachers from foreign countries, who&s;e minds are already formed upon the principles of Monarchy. But this has originated from the nece&s;&s;ity of the ca&s;e. Colleges and free &s;chools under the protection of the legi&s;lature, and the fo&s;|tering care of a &s;ound democratic con&s;titution would be the only effectual pre&s;ervative again&s;t the evil.</P>
<P>The want of a liberal and manly education will render us unable to perceive the value of liberty. It will al&s;o prevent the acqui&s;ition of that dignity and authority of mind, which alone can make a &s;ucce&s;sful &s;tand again&s;t the encroachments of pow|er. Ignorance is mean, and cannot offer the&s;e generous &s;acrifices which our duty to our country demands, when its liberties are endangered. A mind de&s;titute of a proper education, will be ea&s;ily deluded by the &s;ophi&s;tical arguments of tho&s;e who, to &s;erve &s;elfi&s;h pupo&s;es, are ready to explain away every dear-bought privilege, with a view to make converts to doctrines detrimental to the rights of mankind. And with re&s;pect to tho&s;e, who are educated indeed, but educated in the manners and

<P>I SHALL now conclude the remarks, with ob|&s;erving, that the great fundamental principles of political liberty and civil freedom are too little &s;e|cured by our pre&s;ent con&s;titution and laws. And perhaps I am not far wrong when I a&s;&s;ert, that at lea&s;t two thirds of tho&s;e who think at all about matters of government are of the &s;ame opinion.&mdash; The generality of our hone&s;t indu&s;trious citizens, &s;eldom concern them&s;elves about political affairs. Engaged in the commendable employments of hu&s;bandry and agriculture, and per&s;uaded they live in a land of liberty, they feel contented. Peace and Harmony, Friend&s;hip and ho&s;pitality are the natural con&s;equences, and I boa&s;t in adding the di&s;tingui&s;hing characteri&s;tics of the citizens of Virginia.&mdash;Every good man will rejoice that this is the ca&s;e and that the evils which may re&s;ult from our pre&s;ent &s;y&s;tem of government are not at this time &s;en&s;ibly experienced in a general degree.</P>
<P>But all this is no argument again&s;t a revi&s;ion of the government. For as in the human body di&s;|ea&s;es lie &s;ometimes a long while dormant, and the mortal frame appear to enjoy health and vigour; yet at length they break out, and as water confined in limits overleaps the bounds and hurry this earth|ly tabernacle to the du&s;t&mdash;So it is with govern|ments.&mdash;Under the wor&s;t of con&s;titutions nations
<PB N="35" REF="047801_0033_10249A0A02B1BE38">&s;ometimes enjoy happine&s;s, till the daemon of ar|bitrary power a&s;cending the throne, plunge them into the depths of mi&s;ery and &s;lavery. Then my countrymen, let us &s;eize the occa&s;ion which a &s;tate of tranquility affords&mdash;delays are dangerous. And evils are always more ea&s;ily cured, the earlier fit exertions, and proper remedies are applied.</P>
