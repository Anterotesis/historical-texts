<HEAD>TO ALL FREE-MASONS.</HEAD>
<P>THE Author of the following pages has the ho|nour of being well re&s;pected in mo&s;t of the Lodges of reputation in this metropolis, and has been a frequent vi&s;itor at the Queen's Arms, St. Paul's Church-yard; the Globe, in Fleet-&s;treet; the Jeru|&s;alem, at Clerkenwell; Half-moon, Cheap&s;ide; Crown and Anchor, in the Strand; Salutation, Grey-Friars; and &s;everal others of le&s;s note.</P>
<P>An earne&s;t de&s;ire of becoming a perfect ma&s;ter of MASONRY, and the &s;ucce&s;s he met with in his fir&s;t attempt, has rendered him capable of revealing tho&s;e my&s;teries to the world, which, till now, have been kept &s;ecret as the grave.</P>
<P>He acquired his knowledge at fir&s;t from &s;ome loo&s;e papers belonging to a merchant to whom he was nearly related, who had been a member of the Queen's Arms, St. Paul's Church-yard. This rela|tion dying about ten years ago, the Editor became po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of his effects; and on looking over his papers, among others he found &s;ome memorandums or remarks on MASONRY, which excited his curio&s;ity &s;o far, that he re&s;olved on accompli&s;hing his &s;cheme, without going through the ceremonies required by the &s;ociety.</P>
<P>The remarks of his friend above-mentioned fur|ni&s;hed hints &s;ufficient to make a trial on an intimate acquaintance, a FREE MASON, who readily gave him the Sign in the manner he expected. After a more narrow in&s;pection on the part of his friend, &s;uch as, where he was made, and when, &amp;c. &amp;c. (to all
<PB REF="031147_0004_0FEAE28AF6980B30">which he an&s;wered with great readine&s;s) he received an invitation to &s;pend an evening at a tavern in the Strand, with &s;everal acquaintances. Elated by this &s;ucce&s;s, he boldly advanced with his company; all of whom belonged to the Lodge, and were well known by the TYLER at the door. After the u&s;ual ceremony, in which he gave full &s;atisfaction, he was admitted and took his &s;eat. That night he &s;aw two MAKINGS <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">MAKING, the term u&s;ed in the circular letters to the members of the Ledge, acquainting them that new members are to be admitted the next Ledge night.</NOTE>, and came off full of &s;pirits.</P>
<P>Soon after he went to another Lodge, where he di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf greatly in an&s;wering the que&s;|tions propo&s;ed by the Ma&s;ter, which he acquired from his friend's manu&s;cripts of the ENTERED AP|PRENTICE, and FELLOW-CRAFT's Lectures.</P>
<P>His regard to the &s;ociety, and re&s;pect to the pub|lic, is the only inducement to this publication, which is intended not only to a&s;&s;i&s;t tho&s;e who have been lately made, and &s;till remain ignorant of the true foundation of the Art, but al&s;o to give all that have an inclination to become Ma&s;ons an opportunity of con&s;idering the advantages and di&s;advantages of the engagements and oaths by which they are bound.&mdash; Such is the intention of this undertaking; and the Editor flatters him&s;elf the Brotherhood will not con|demn his officiou&s;ne&s;s in this re&s;pect, as it will rather &s;trengthen than hurt the intere&s;t of the &s;ociety; the fear of going through the ceremony, which hitherto has been repre&s;ented in &s;uch frightful &s;hapes, being the greate&s;t ob&s;tacle to its future welfare and increa&s;e.</P>
<P>The Editor's ambition is to plea&s;e; and the work is &s;ubmitted to the only proper judges, viz. his Bre|thren the FREE MASONS; to whom he begs leave to declare, that no private or public quarrel, the view of gain, nor any other motive than the public good could ever have induced him to write upon this &s;ub|ject; and he declares to the world, that the following is the whole of true MASONRY in all its branches.</P>
<P><PB REF="031147_0005_0FEAE292FB7004C8">
SINCE the former edition of this pamphlet was put to pre&s;s the author has received from his publi&s;her &s;everal annony|mous letters, containing the lowe&s;t abu&s;e and &s;currilous invec|tives; nay, &s;ome have proceeded &s;o far as to threaten his per|&s;on. He reque&s;ts the favour of all enraged brethren, who &s;hall chu&s;e to di&s;play their talents for the future, that they will be &s;o kind as to pay the po&s;tage of their letters, for there can be no rea&s;on why he &s;hould put up with their ill treatment, and pay the piper into the bargain. Surely there mu&s;t be &s;omething in this book very extraordinary; a &s;omething they cannot dige&s;t, thus to excite the wrath and ire of tho&s;e hot brained Ma&s;on-bit gentry! But however unwiling the Editor may be to publi&s;h <HI>all</HI> the letters and me&s;&s;ages he has received on this occa&s;ion, yet he cannot be &s;o deficient in returning the compliment, as to con|ceal one, which notwith&s;tanding the threatenings contained in it, appears to be wrote with very little meaning, and he has (&s;ans ceremonie) ventured to publi&s;h it verbatim.</P>

<HEAD>AN AUTHENTIC KEY TO THE DOOR OF FREE-MASONRY.</HEAD>
<P>THE origin <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The rife of this &s;cience (&s;ays a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> original record) was before the flood in the 4th chapter of Gene&s;is it is &s;aid, there was a man named <HI>Lamech</HI> who had two wives named <HI>Adah</HI> and <HI>Zillah;</HI> by <HI>Adah</HI> he begat two &s;ons. <HI>Jubal</HI> and <HI>Jubal:</HI> by <HI>Zillah</HI> be begat one &s;on. called <HI>Tubal Cain,</HI> and a daughter named <HI>Naamah.</HI> The&s;e children found out the beginning of all the Crafts in the world; <HI>Jubal</HI> found out Geometry; he divided flocks of &s;heep, and built the fir&s;t hou&s;e of timber and &s;tone. <HI>Jubal</HI> found out the art of Mu&s;ic, and was the father of all tho&s;e who handled the harp. <HI>Tubal Cain</HI> was the in&s;tructor of all artificers in iron and bra&s;s; and his daughter di&s;covered the Craft of Weaving.</NOTE> of the &s;ociety called Free-Ma&s;ons is &s;aid by &s;ome to have been a certain number of per&s;ons who formed a re&s;olution to rebuild the Temple of <HI>Solomon</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">By an old record it appears, that king <HI>Solomon</HI> confirmed all the charges which king <HI>David</HI> had given to Ma&s;ons in <HI>Jeru&s;alem;</HI> and that the Temple was fini&s;hed A. M. 3000. In the year 43. after <HI>Chri&s;t,</HI> Ma&s;ons fir&s;t came into <HI>England</HI> and built the Mona&s;tery of <HI>Gla&s;tonbury</HI> in <HI>Somer&s;et&s;hire.</HI></NOTE>. This appears from the lecture, or rather hi&s;tory, of the Order, at the mak|ing or rai&s;ing of a member to the degree of Ma&s;ter, which is fully de&s;cribed in the following work. But I am inclined to
<PB REF="031147_0008_0FEAE29B1754F620">think that the chief de&s;ign of the e&s;tabli&s;hment is to rectify the heart, inform the mind, and promote the moral and &s;ocial virtues of humanity, decency, and good order, as much <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> po&s;&s;ible in the world: and &s;ome of the emblems of Free-Ma&s;ons confirm this opinion, &s;uch as the Compa&s;s, Rule, Square, &amp;c.</P>
<P>In all countries where Ma&s;onry is practi&s;ed, or e&s;tabli&s;hed at this time, there is a Grand Ma&s;ter; but formerly there was only one Grand Ma&s;ter, and he was an <HI>Engli&s;hman.</HI> HIS ROYAL HICHNESS GEORCE PRINCE OF WALES is the per&s;on on whom the dignity is now be&s;towed, who governs all the Lodges in <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> and has the power of delivering the con&s;titutions and laws of the &s;ociety to the Ma&s;ters who pre&s;ide over the &s;ubordinate a&s;&s;emblies: which con&s;titutions mu&s;t always be &s;igned by the Grand Secretary of the Order.&mdash;The Grand Ma&s;ter can hold a Meeting or Lodge when he thinks proper, which is generally the &s;econd <HI>Saturday</HI> in every month in the &s;ummer, but oftener in the winter.</P>
<P>The other Lodges meet regularly twice a month in the winter half-year, and once a month in the &s;ummer; and the members of each Lodge pay quarterly, from 3 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> 6 <ABBR>d.</ABBR> to 5 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> into the hands of the Trea&s;urer; and this generally defrays the expence of their meetings.</P>
<P>There are al&s;o quarterly communications or meetings, held, at which are pre&s;ent the Ma&s;ter and Wardens of every re|gular con&s;titution in and near <HI>London,</HI> where the &s;everal Lodges &s;end, by the &s;aid Wardens, different &s;ums of money to be paid into the hands of the Trea&s;urer-General, and ap|propriated to &s;uch charitable u&s;es as the Grand Ma&s;ter, and the Ma&s;ters of the different Lodges under him, think proper; but the&s;e charities are chiefly confined to Ma&s;ons only. Such as have good recommendations as to their behaviour and cha|racter, will be a&s;&s;i&s;ted with five, ten, or twenty pounds; and lefs &s;ums are di&s;tributed to the indigent brethren, in pro|portion to their wants, and the number of years they have been members. At the&s;e quarterly communications, large &s;ums are likewi&s;e &s;ent from Lodges in the mo&s;t remote parts of the world, viz. in the <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> and <HI>We&s;t-Indies.</HI> and accounts tran&s;mitted of the growth of Ma&s;onry there. The &s;tate of the funds of the &s;ociety are likewi&s;e communicated to the company, and the deliberations of the meeting taken down by the Secretary, who lays them before the Grand Ma&s;ter at the yearly meeting.</P>
<P>The number of members which compo&s;e a Lodge is inde|terminate: but it is no Lodge except there are pre&s;ent one Ma&s;ter, three Fellow Crafts, and two Apprentices.</P>
<P><PB REF="031147_0009_0FEAE29E2BFA06B0">
When a Lodge is met, there are two principal officers un|der the Ma&s;ter, called Senior and Junior Wardens, who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s it is to &s;ee the laws of the &s;ociety &s;trictly adhered to, and the word of command given by the Grand Ma&s;ter, regu|larly followed.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be remarked, that the authority of a Ma&s;ter, though chief of the Lodge, reach <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> no farther than he is him&s;elf an ob&s;erver of the laws; &s;hould he infringe them, the brethren never fail to cen&s;ure him; and if this has no effect, they have a power of dopo&s;ing him, and appealing to the Grand Ma&s;ter, and giving their rea&s;ons for it; but they &s;eldom proceed to this extremity.</P>
<P>As no doubt the reader chu&s;es to be made acquainted with every circum&s;tance of the ceremony of making a Ma&s;on, I &s;hall begin with the following directions, and proceed regularly in the de&s;cription of what further concerns Ma&s;onry.</P>
<P>A man de&s;irous of becoming a Free-Ma&s;on, &s;hould endea|vour to get acquainted with a member of &s;ome good Lodge, who will propo&s;e him as a candidate for admi&s;&s;ion the next Lodge-night. The Brother who propo&s;es a new member, is likewi&s;e obliged to inform the Brethren of the qualifications of the candidate <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">For the good of this, and all other &s;ocieties, it were to be wi&s;hed a more &s;trict regard was paid, on the part of the propo&s;ers, to the character and morals of every candidate.</NOTE>. Upon this it is debated whether or not he &s;hall be admitted; and it being carried in the affirmative, the next &s;tep is to go with the propo&s;er the en&s;uing Lodge-night.</P>
<P>The evening being come when a Lodge is to be held, which generally begins about &s;even in the winter, and nine in the &s;ummer, as previous notices are &s;ent to the members for this purpo&s;e; the Ma&s;ons are punctual to time, and it frequently happens, that, in half an hour, the whole Lodge, to the number of fifty or &s;ixty, are a&s;&s;embled.</P>
<P>The Ma&s;ter, the two A&s;&s;i&s;tants, Secretary, and Trea&s;urer, begin with putting over their necks a blue ribbon of a trian|gular &s;hape; to the Ma&s;ter's ribbon hangs a Rule and Compa&s;s, which is in &s;ome Lodges made of gold, though in others only gilt: the A&s;&s;i&s;tants, Senior Wardens, and the other officers, carry the Compa&s;s alone.</P>
<P>The candles are placed upon the table in the form of a triangle; and in the be&s;t Lodges the candle&s;ticks are finely carved with emblematical figures. Every Brother has an apron made of white &s;kin, and the &s;trings are al&s;o of &s;kin; though &s;ome of them chu&s;e to ornament them with ribbons
<PB N="4" REF="031147_0010_0FEAE2A149606FB8">of various colours. On the grand days, &s;uch as quarterly communications, or general meetings, the grand officers aprons are finely decorated, and they carry the Rule and Compa&s;s, the emblems of the Order.</P>
<P>When they &s;it down to the table, the Ma&s;ter's place is on the ea&s;t &s;ide, the bible being opened before him, with the Compa&s;s laid thereon, and the points of them covered with a lignum vitae or box Square; and the Senior and Junior Wardens oppo&s;ite to him on the we&s;t and &s;outh. On the table is likewi&s;e wine, punch, &amp;c. to regale the Brethren, who take their places according to their &s;eniority. Being thus &s;eated, after a few minutes, the Ma&s;ter proceeds to<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>To open a Lodge,</HI> in Ma&s;onry, &s;ignifies that it is allowed to &s;peak freely among one another of the my&s;teries of the Order</NOTE> <HI>open the Lodge</HI> in the following manner:</P>

<P>He is al&s;o learnt th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;tep, or how to advance to the Ma&s;ter upon the drawing on the floor, which in &s;ome Lodges re&s;em|bles the grand building, termed a Mo&s;aic Palace, and is de|&s;cribed with the utmo&s;t exactne&s;s. They al&s;o draw other figures, one of which is called the Laced Tuft, and the other, the Throne be&s;et with Stars. There is al&s;o repre&s;ented a per|pendicular line in the form of a Ma&s;ons' in&s;trument, com|monly called the Plumb-Line; and another figure which repre&s;ents the Tomb of <HI>Hiram,</HI> the fir&s;t Grand Ma&s;ter, who has been dead almo&s;t three thou&s;and years. The&s;e are all explained to him in the mo&s;t accurate manner, and the orna|ments or emblems of the Order are de&s;cribed with great fa|cility. The ceremony being now ended, the new made member is obliged to take a mop out of a pail of water brought for that purpo&s;e, and rub out the drawing on the floor, if it is done with chalk and charcoal. Then he is con|ducted back, and every thing that he was d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">c&s;ted of is re|&s;tored, and he takes his &s;eat on the right hand of the Ma&s;ter. He al&s;o receives an apron, which he puts on, and the li&s;t of the Lodges is likewi&s;e given him.</P>
<P>The Brethren now congratulate the new-made member, and all return to the table to regale them&s;elves; when the Ma&s;ter propo&s;es a health to the young Brother, which is drank with the greate&s;t applau&s;e by the whole body, the new Ma&s;on &s;itting all the while. After which he, in&s;tructed by a Brother, takes a bumper, and drinks <Q>To the Wor|&s;hipful Grand Ma&s;ter, the Senior and Junior Wardens, the re&s;t of the Officers and Members of the Lodge, wi&s;h|ing them &s;ucce&s;s in all their public and private under|takings, to Ma&s;onry in general, and that Lodge in par|ticular, craving their a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</Q> To which they an&s;wer, "they will a&s;&s;i&s;t him." And after he has drank, the throws his gla&s;s from him, and brings it back three times, and then &s;ets it down on the table, the re&s;t doing the &s;ame in exact order. This they call firing: then they clap their hands nine times divided into three, and &s;top between each, keeping true time.</P>
<P>The reader having been led thus far, it is high time to introduce the Apprentice's Lecture, which is intended not only to amu&s;e, but likewi&s;e to in&s;truct him in the part he is entered into. The readine&s;s of many of the Brethren in an&s;wering the que&s;tions, adds a lu&s;tre to the Order, the members vying with each other who &s;hall mo&s;t contribute to the edification of their new Brother.</P>

<L>What mortal can boa&s;t,</L>
<L>So noble a toa&s;t,</L>
<L>As a free and an Accepted Ma&s;on?</L></STAGE>
<P>While this &s;ong is &s;inging, they all &s;tand round the table, and when they come to the la&s;t ver&s;e they join hands cro&s;s|ways in the following manner: the right hand man takes hold of the left hand of his neighbour with his right hand: and the left hand man takes hold of the right hand of his next Brother with his left hand, &s;o as to form a chain by &s;o many links, and all join in the chorus, jumping violently with their feet on the floor, and &s;haking their hands up and down, linked together as above, keeping exact time with both.</P>
<P>Every one now talks of what he plea&s;es; and as it is gene|rally half an hour before they proceed to bu&s;ine&s;s, tho&s;e who perhaps have ordered a &s;upper retire into another room;
<PB REF="031147_0027_0FEAE8A94A4CEEB0">but before they are permited, the Ma&s;ter proceeds <HI>to call the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> off from work,</HI> as it is termed, which is done in this manner: the Ma&s;ter whi&s;pers to the Senior Deacon, who &s;its on his right hand, and &s;ays, "It is high time to call the men from work to refre&s;h them&s;elves:" The Senior Deacon whi&s;pers it to the Senior Warden; and it is communicated from him to the Junior Deacon, who carries it to the Junior Warden; he preclaims it openly to the Lodge, and &s;ets his column up|right<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Senior and Junior Warden's Columns are about twenty-five inches long, and repre&s;ent the Columns that &s;upport the Porch of <HI>Solomon's</HI> Tem|ple; The Senior's is called JACHIN, and &s;ignifies <HI>Strength;</HI> the Junior's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">OAZ, and &s;ignifies, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> in the Lord.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the Fir&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of King's, Chap.

<P>In this place it will be nece&s;&s;ary to acquaint the reader how he may di&s;cover an Entered Apprentice by drinking with him in company. Take the gla&s;s with your right hand, and draw it acro&s;s your throat, either before or after you drink; and if an Apprentice is pre&s;ent, he will imme|diately take notice of it, by a&s;king you &s;ome que&s;tion in Ma&s;onry, which you will readily an&s;wer from this book. If he a&s;ks you the meaning of your doing that, you may whi&s;per to him, that it is the penalty of the Obligation of an Entered Apprentice. From this an&s;wer he will proceed farther in his Inquiry.</P>
<P>The Brethern having now regaled them&s;elves, they take their &s;eats, and the ma&s;ter proceeds to &s;et them on again, which is performed in the &s;ame manner as the calling off; with this difference, the Warden proclaims, <Q>It is our Wor&s;hipful Ma&s;ter's plea&s;ure that this Lodge is called from refre&s;hment to work.</Q> The Junior Warden lays down his Column, and the Senior &s;ets his up. But as it often happens, that the time will not permit for the Fellow-Craft's Lecture, they clo&s;e the Lodge, which is done after the &s;ame manner as that of opening. The Senior Warden declares it in the following words: <Q>It is our Ma&s;ter's will and plea&s;ure, that this Lodge &s;tand clo&s;ed till the fir&s;t or third Wedne&s;day in the next month,</Q> according to the night the Lodge is held. Then the Ma&s;ter, Wardens, Deacons, Secretary, &amp;c. take off the En&s;igns and Orna|ments from their necks, and every one is at liberty to de|part or &s;tay longer; every thing of Ma&s;onry is excluded; they talk of what they plea&s;e, and &s;ing various &s;ongs for their amu&s;ement.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now proceed to the &s;econd degree of Ma&s;onry, cal|led the <HI>Fellow-Craft</HI>'s: that is, one who has &s;erved his time ju&s;tly and lawfully as an Entered Apprentice, and de&s;ires to

As one of the twelve was travelling on the &s;ea-&s;ide, near <HI>Joppa,</HI> being fatigued, he &s;at down to refre&s;h him&s;elf: but was &s;oon alarmed by the following hideous exclamations from the cliff of a rock: <Q>Oh! that my throat had been cut acro&s;s, my tongue torn out by the root, and buried in the &s;ands of the &s;ea at low-water mark, a cable's length from the &s;hore, where the tide ebbs and flows twice in twenty-four hours, e'er I had con&s;ented to the death of our Grand Ma&s;ter <HI>Hiram!</HI>"&mdash;"Oh!

Oh! that my body had been &s;ever|ed in two, and &s;cattered to the &s;outh and north; my bow|els burnt to a&s;hes in the &s;outh, and &s;cattered between the four winds of the earth, ere I had been the cau&s;e of the death of our good Ma&s;ter <HI>Hiram!</HI></Q> The Fellow-Craft bearing this, went in que&s;t of his two afs;&s;ociates, and they entered the cliff of the rock, took and bound them fa&s;t, and brought them to king <HI>Solomon,</HI> before whom they voluntarily confe&s;&s;ed their guilt, and begged to die. The &s;entence pa&s;&s;ed on them was the &s;ame as they expre&s;&s;ed in their lamentation in the cliff; <HI>Jubela</HI>'s throat was cut acro&s;s; <HI>Jubela</HI>'s heart was

<P>"When the execution was over, king <HI>Solomon</HI> &s;ent for the twelve Crafts, and de&s;ired them to take the body of <HI>Hiram</HI> up, in order that it might be interred in a &s;olemn manner in the <HI>Sanctum Sanctorum;</HI> he al&s;o told them, that if they could not find a key-word about him, it was lo&s;t; for there were only three in the world to whom it was known; and unle&s;s they were pre&s;ent it could not be delivered, <HI>Hiram</HI> being dead it con&s;equently was lo&s;t. However, as <HI>Solomon</HI> ordered, they went and cleared the rubbi&s;h, and found their Ma&s;ter in a mangled condition, having lain fifteen days; upon which they lifted up their hands above their heads in a&s;toni&s;hment, and &s;aid, <HI>O Lord, my God!</HI> This being the fir&s;t word and &s;ign, king <HI>Solomon</HI> adopted it as the grand &s;ign of a Ma&s;ter Ma&s;on, and it is u&s;ed at this day in all the Lodges of Ma&s;ters.</P>

And tell him you &s;hould be glad of admittance as a vi&s;iting member; taking care to provide your&s;elf with a white leather apron, which you may &s;hew him as if by ac|cident. He will, perhaps, a&s;k you what degree you are of, and de&s;ire a &s;ign, which you may &s;hew him with Readine&s;s, and likewi&s;e inform him what Lodge you belong to.</P>
<P>It being contrary to the Rules of the &s;ociety that the Tyler &s;hould admit a &s;tranger, he will go in, and acquaint the Ma&s;ter, that &s;uch a per&s;on (mentioning your name, and the Lodge you told him you belonged to) craves admittance, upon which one of the Wardens will come out to examine you, draw your right hand acro&s;s your throat edgeways, and he will &s;ay, "Whats that?" Your an&s;wer mu&s;t be "The due guard of an Apprentice." Then he will take you by the fir&s;t joint of the thumb of your right hand, and pre&s;s it hand with the thumb-nail of the right hand, and a&s;k, "What's this?"&mdash;You mu&s;t immediately an&s;wer, "The grip of an Entered Apprentice."&mdash;If he is not fully &s;atisfied with this, he will go further on in this manner.</P>
<P><HI>Que&s;.</HI> Has it got a name?&mdash;You mu&s;t an&s;wer, "It has." Then he will a&s;k you to give it him.</P>

<L>ONE night as Ned crept into bed,</L>
<L>Beyond his u&s;ual hour,</L>
<L>His loving Kate, his con&s;tant mate,</L>
<L>Began to &s;cold and low'r.</L>
<L>You naughty man, where have you been,</L>

</LG>
<LG>
<L>I own, dear Kate, 'tis &s;omewhat late,</L>
<L>But hear me out with patience,</L>
<L>All wives you know, are bound to &s;hew</L>
<L>Their hu&s;bands due obei&s;ance;</L>
<L>In truth, dear Kate, 'tis &s;omewhat late,</L>
<L>But put a &s;miling face on,</L>
<L>For I, this night, am made a bright,</L>
<L>Free, and accepted Ma&s;on.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>If this be &s;o, I pray now &s;how</L>
<L>Some certain &s;ign or token,</L>
<L>For Ma&s;ons can erect a plan,</L>
<L>Or &s;top a breach that's open.</L>
<L>I have a breach, a huge wide breach,</L>
<L>That gives me much vexation,</L>
<L>This if you &s;top, you will o'er top,</L>
<L>All Ma&s;ons in the nation.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then Ned aro&s;e, pull'd off his clothes,</L>
<L>Drew out his line and level,</L>
<L>He plac'd his plumb beneath her bomb,</L>
<L>And brought it to a bevil;</L>
<L>He took his guage, his nine-inch guage,</L>
<L>And plac'd it with a &s;loping,</L>
<L>He fix'd his &s;tones like Inigo Jones,</L>
<L>And left no crevice open.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Dear Ned, &s;ays Kate, you've done a feat,</L>
<L>A feat of mighty wonder,</L>
<L>And as for me, you painly &s;ee,</L>
