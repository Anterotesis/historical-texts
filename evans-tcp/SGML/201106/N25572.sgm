<HEAD>An Oration, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>TO think well of even the defects of our country, is a pardonable infirmity. To view them with indulgence,&mdash;to approach them with filial re|verence and tenderne&s;s and to cover them with the mantle of a partial, and almo&s;t blind affection, is a degree of virtue. But to value and boa&s;t her ex|cellencies and ble&s;&s;ings, to exult in her honor and be made happy by her happine&s;s, is in&s;eparable from every ju&s;t mind, and generous heart. If this nationality of &s;entiment and feeling be &s;uit|able in her fathers, who are approaching the time, in which they will be unaffected by her fortunes, and relea&s;ed from her &s;ervice; it is truly graceful in her children, who, ju&s;t parting, or parted, from the goal, mu&s;t run with her their whole career of life; and make and &s;hare her di&s;grace or glory, her mi&s;ery or happine&s;s. If this &s;en&s;ibility to her in|tere&s;ts dignify age, and adorn youth at all times, it
<PB N="4" REF="033963_0003_0FF9C061A3A899E0">does it <HI>then</HI> more than ever, when not only her rights are invaded, and her fame reproached, but a deadly potion is held to her mouth, and a murderous dagger aimed at her bo&s;om.</P>
<P>THOUGH the eulogy of the ble&s;&s;ings and pro&s;|pects of <HI>America</HI> is &s;o common, as to want the at|traction of novelty; and &s;ometimes &s;o extravagant, as to incur the imputation of vanity; yet, in an ex|igency of her circum&s;tances, which demands all the enthu&s;ia&s;m of patrioti&s;m, and engages all the feel|ings of philanthropy; in an a&s;&s;embly, compo&s;ed of per&s;ons, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing, or anticipating more or le&s;s in|fluence upon her opinions and conduct; and in a place, con&s;ecrated to the &s;ublime purpo&s;e of rear|ing her guides, her models, and her guardians; it can be neither unplea&s;ant nor unin&s;tructive, to ex|tol her felicity, to unfold her dangers, and to incul|cate her duty.</P>
<P>AN ample field for &s;plendid de&s;cription, and for animating prophecy lies open, in the population, op|ulence, and pro&s;perity of our country, in the ferti|lity and variety of her &s;oil, in the advantages of her climate and &s;ituation, in the abundance of her pro|ductions, in the exten&s;ivene&s;s of her commerce, and the immen&s;ity of her re&s;ources. But it may be more u&s;eful and agreeable, on this occa&s;ion, to con|fine our attention to tho&s;e PRINCIPLES, MAN|NERS.
<PB N="5" REF="033963_0004_0FF9DDC269D86318">and INSTITUTIONS, which are the price and pledge of all her other ble&s;&s;ings; and to illu&s;|trate our obligations and motives to cheri&s;h them, in their pure &s;pirit and tendency, as they were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;|ed and tran&s;mitted to us by our predece&s;&s;ors, unadul|terated by latter mixtures of error and vice.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">THE text for this comment, is prepared by that man, who&s;e name will be coeval with his country, in his addre&s;s to the young men of the American metropolis. "Without wi&s;hing," &s;ays he, "to damp the ardor of curio&s;ity, or influence the freedom of inquiry. I will hazard a predic|tion, that after the mo&s;t indu&s;trious, and impartial re&s;earches, the longe&s;t liver of you all, will find no principles, in&s;titutions or &s;y&s;tems of educa|tion, more fit in general to be tran&s;mitted to your po&s;terity, than tho&s;e, which you have received from your ance&s;tors." Let not this prediction, &s;o &s;olemn and affectionate, be di&s;regarded, le&s;t we &s;ee the day of bitter, but ineffectual repentance.</NOTE> The&s;e <HI>principles, habits,</HI> and <HI>in&s;titutions</HI> are not the ephem|eral productions of the day; not the no&s;trums of up&s;tart political quackery; not the novel di&s;cove|ries of infidel philo&s;ophy; not the vagaries of brains, di&s;tempered with revolutionary fervor; but they are fabrics, rai&s;ed by time, covered with the "vene|rable hoar" of years, founded in wi&s;dom, improved by experience, and evinced the mo&s;t &s;ufficient bar|riers, that man can erect, again&s;t the inundations of vice, folly, and mi&s;ery. They are, to our country, the <HI>"tree of life in the mid&s;t of the city, which yields her fruit continually, the leaves whereof are for the healing of the nations."</HI> Let our wi&s;dom and vir|tue guard it, as the cherubim and flaming &s;word, which turned every way, guarded the avenue to the tree of <HI>Eden.</HI> Let them defend it from the demons, infidelity, ambition, and faction, which are prowl|ing

<P>IT would be no unintere&s;ting labor, to attempt a minute delineation of the whole de&s;ign and expre&s;|&s;ion, colouring and drapery of the piece, on which our fathers, and we have been working; but the pre|&s;ent opportunity will afford &s;ufficient time only for &s;ketching a few of its characteri&s;tic outlines.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t of the <HI>political</HI> principles, which we have received, a principle often expre&s;&s;ed in very indefinite language, and who&s;e mi&s;conception, or perver&s;ion, has in a manner annihilated &s;ociety in one country in <HI>Europe,</HI> is this, "THAT ALL MEN ARE BORN FREE AND EQUAL." The bla&s;phemies ut|tered, the crimes committed, and the de&s;olation &s;pread within the &s;pace of a few years, in the <HI>name</HI> of <HI>liberty and equality,</HI> have a&s;&s;ociated &s;uch turpitude and horror with the words, that the blood freezes, the heart &s;ickens at their &s;ound. Viewed in this a&s;|&s;ociation, in&s;tead of tutelary divinities demanding the love and veneration of men, for the ble&s;&s;ings which they &s;hed, they appear tremendous &s;pectres, born of chaos and &s;talking through the earth with the &s;cythe of de&s;truction. If we &s;ee them only in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word">
<PB N="7" REF="033963_0006_0FF9C0C3193B2310">of the&s;e their pretended patrons and guar|dians, they are the agents of envenomed envy, of phrenzied ambition, and in&s;atiate avarice, com|mi&s;&s;ioned to go forth into the nations, and convert man into a brute, kingdoms into theatres of blood, and &s;ociety into a dreary wa&s;te, on which "vegetates no plant but the hemlock and the night-&s;hade;" they are another name for robbery, deva&s;tation, and murder; for a lofty and pre&s;umptuous indepen|dence of all laws, natural, civil, moral, and divine; an impious victory over all the motives and feelings, implanted by the Creator, to check and modify the infinitaly diverging action of the human will and pa&s;&s;ions, and prevent the &s;ocial &s;tate from being wor&s;e than a de&s;ert.</P>
<P>BUT breaking this unnatural a&s;&s;ociation, we find that <HI>we</HI> have not &s;o learned liberty, and that, well under&s;tood, it is the fir&s;t of ble&s;&s;ings. As it is taught in our &s;chool, the liberty of a nation, with re&s;pect to other nations, is the right of governing it&s;elf in con&s;i&s;tency with their rights. Such a liber|ty we po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, before our &s;eparation from the pa|rent country, until her &s;y&s;tem of aggre&s;&s;ion began. We ever denied her claim to bind us in any ca&s;e, without our con&s;ent. Since revolution has come to mean &s;ubver&s;ion, it means too much to be appli|ed to that alteration of our political relations made by independence. We contended for pre&s;ervation.
<PB N="8" REF="033963_0007_0FF9C076B4228308">not acqui&s;ition, to keep the rights we had, rather than to gain tho&s;e we never had; and the &s;eparation was re&s;orted to chiefly as a nece&s;&s;ary means of main|taining the ancient ground. We are not therefore very much flattered, that our former ally &s;hould think we were complimented, in being told of our emancipation from actual rather than threatened &s;lavery, by our revolutionary conte&s;t. We will not in&s;ult the a&s;hes of our fathers, by admitting, for a moment, that they were ever "hewers of wood, and drawers of water," to any power on earth; that they, who conveyed to us an abhorrence of &s;la|very, ever &s;ubmitted to it; and we will correct the mi&s;take, and repel the taunt of our hypocritical friend in the language of our illu&s;trious &s;on of li|berty, a&s;&s;uring her, that every AMERICAN, was "BORN IN A LAND OF FREEDOM."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Ade<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">'s addre&s;s to the Pre&s;ident on pre&s;enting the colours of the French Republic; and the Pre&s;ident's an&s;wer.</NOTE> We have been taught not more re&s;olutely to &s;ix our gra&s;p on our own in|dependence, than <HI>&s;incerely to re&s;pect the independence of other nations;</HI> to di&s;dain the ambition of conque&s;t and the meanne&s;s and treachery of interference with their internal concerns.</P>
<P>BY <HI>liberty,</HI> as it re&s;pects our internal relations, we under&s;tand protection of rights; and by <HI>rights,</HI> the claim of every member of the community to all the advatages which he can obtain and enjoy, without injuring others. The&s;e rights are declared to be the right to life and per&s;onal &s;ecurity, the right
<PB N="9" REF="033963_0008_0FF9DDF2E25BCAA8">to acquire, hold, and tran&s;mit property, the right to liberty of action, the right to reputation, the right to liberty of opinion, of &s;peech, and of religious pro|fe&s;&s;ion and wor&s;hip. But we con&s;ider all the&s;e rights &s;ubject to various limitations and exceptions. We deny that they allow any one to be judge in his own cau&s;e; or to exert them in any way incon&s;i&s;tent with law. Society here does not &s;ecure life to the murderer, freedom of action to the madman, prop|erty to the thief, robber, or knave, reputation to the villain, nor liberty of &s;peech and writing to the tongues or pens, which mi&s;lead the ignorant or cor|rupt the pure, which bla&s;pheme God and trumpet &s;edition. Our commonwealth claims to limit even the rights of con&s;cience. Whil&s;t it tolerates every denomination of religious teachers, it requires the maintenance of &s;ome denomination; and whil&s;t it extends protection to the Jew, Mahometan, and Gentoo, it in&s;i&s;ts that a chri&s;tian people will commit the enaction and admini&s;tration of their laws to none but tho&s;e, who profe&s;s to be chri&s;tians.</P>

<P><PB N="10" REF="033963_0009_0FF9C07CA8410DC0">
OUR political fathers have taught us to di&s;tin|gui&s;h between the right to protection, and the right to govern the &s;tate; to con&s;ider that the &s;hare which each member &s;hall have in the management of public affairs, is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> of convention and expediency, and not an original univer&s;al right of man. Whil&s;t our Con&s;titutions admit to the privilege of choo&s;ing, and being cho&s;en, to public office, as many cla&s;&s;es of the &s;ociety, as con&s;i&s;ts with the general &s;afety, they reject that doctrine of univer&s;al &s;uffrage, which has &s;o much contributed in other countries to pull down the fabric of &s;ocial order. They di&s;qualify from the exerci&s;e of political rights all per&s;ons not arrived to a certain age, and all per&s;ons de&s;titute of property; pre&s;uming that without di&s;cretion, election is wor&s;e than a lottery; and that whil&s;t proprietors will probably perceive a certain intere&s;t in order and ju&s;tice, the extremely indigent may hope to profit by anarchy and rapine. For very diffe|rent rea&s;ons they debar the better half of &s;ociety from the direct exerci&s;e of the powers of civil government. Had the new theory of the <HI>Rights of Women</HI> enlighten|ed the world at the period of the formation of our con|&s;titution, it is po&s;&s;ible the framers, convinced by its ar|guments, might have &s;et a&s;ide the old &s;y&s;tem of exclu|&s;ion, upon which the world has always proceeded till this reforming age, as &s;elfi&s;h, illiberal, and tyrannical; perhaps they might have felt it ab&s;urd and in&s;olent
<PB N="11" REF="033963_0010_0FF9DE0786783060">for man to claim the honor of being the protector and guardian of woman; and pernicious al&s;o, if they had acknowledged with the champion of her &s;ex's rights, that it is a con&s;equence of the pre&s;ent order to compel woman to re&s;ort to art, in&s;incerity, and meanne&s;s, in order to &s;upply, by influence the want of prerogative. To di&s;prove this con&s;e|quence, however, we appeal to the &s;implicity and frankne&s;s of manners, and dignity of &s;entiment of American females; and to te&s;t this &s;ingular theory, we may &s;ubmit to them the que&s;tion, whether they are not as free, as lovely, as re&s;pectable, and happy, in their pre&s;ent &s;ituation in &s;ociety, as they would be, if their &s;exuality of character, and employments were done away; and law and cu&s;tom allowed them to exchange the di&s;taff for the plough; the needle and the pencil for the axe and the hammer; and their &s;tations as mi&s;tre&s;&s;es of their families, com|panions of their hu&s;bands, guides and protectors of their children, and equal &s;harers of dome&s;tic pur&s;uits and plea&s;ures; to be lawyers, legi&s;la|tors, and town meeting patriots. We &s;ubmit to them, whether they are not content to make the be&s;t part of the object of all government, which is <HI>&s;ociety,</HI> and to leave to us the drudgery and vexation, the conte&s;t and danger of providing the <HI>means</HI> of &s;ecuring that object.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="033963_0011_0FF9DE171E982740">
WE have learned that government, as well as liber|ty, is among the rights of the people, and that whil&s;t they may e&s;tabli&s;h, amend or alter their forms, all e&s;&s;ential changes are to be attempted with a cautious and trembling hand. If we li&s;ten to the in&s;truction which we have received, we &s;hall not think our&s;elves at liberty capriciou&s;ly to di&s;&s;olve a partner&s;hip, which includes our po&s;terity; wantonly to break up the foundations of the &s;tate, in order to build on the ruins a theoretic edifice de&s;titute of the aid of o|pinion, habit and attachment&mdash;nor &s;hall we allow &s;ociety to be "treated as a <HI>carte blanche,</HI> on which every man may &s;cribble what he plea&s;es."</P>
<P>THESE are <HI>our</HI> rights of man; this is <HI>our</HI> liberty; this, <HI>our</HI> equality. There is another &s;ort of liberty and equality, which we con&s;ider to be &s;purious&mdash; 'tis fancys child, and folly is its father, made of &s;uch &s;tuff as dreams are, and ba&s;ele&s;s as the fanta&s;tic vi|&s;ions of the evening" and which we leave to tho&s;e who choo&s;e it&mdash;to that <HI>regenerated nation&punc;</HI> who&s;e government con&s;iders the people as made for the government, and not the government for the people; pre&s;erves the freedom of elections by the bayonet, and coins money by the guillotine, makes it DEATH TO EMIGRATE, AND DEATH TO STAY AT HOME. We leave it to tho&s;e wonderful philo&s;ophers, who in the plenitude of their wi&s;dom, have no u&s;e for the fund accumulated by pa&s;t ages; who have di&s;covered,
<PB N="13" REF="033963_0012_0FF9C0814C4DE700">that the collective good depends on the &s;acrifice of the individual good; that the end &s;anctifies the means; that property is a prejudice, and pre&s;crip|tion of no validity, and we leave to them al&s;o, all the <HI>order, ju&s;tice, &s;ecurity,</HI> and <HI>liberty,</HI> which they derive from their <HI>precious</HI> di&s;coveries.</P>
<P>PATRIOTISM, rightly defined, has never been repre&s;ented to us&punc; as a doubtful virtue, &s;till le&s;s as a vice. But &s;ince it is found an ob&s;tacle to the &s;ubjugation of man by certain metaphy&s;ical re|formers and tyrants, they have &s;et up the cant of uni|ver&s;al benevolence, in which it is to be lo&s;t, as the drops in the ocean. Whoever heard before, that becau&s;e we mu&s;t love our neighbour, we mu&s;t hate our&s;elves; or becau&s;e we mu&s;t de&s;ire the happine&s;s of the world, we mu&s;t be indifferent to that of our country; that we mu&s;t neglect or de&s;troy the parts, in our zeal to take care of the whole?

REVEALED religion has the venerable &s;anction of the wi&s;e&s;t and be&s;t of our predece&s;&s;ors, joined to its own augu&s;t authority. Tho&s;e, who hold fa&s;t the form of &s;ound words which they have delivered, can &s;ee neither dignity nor con&s;olation in the &s;eparation of time from eternity; of man from his creator. From whom but the fountain of wi&s;dom &s;hall we derive the knowledge of our nature, origin and de&s;tiny? Does blindne&s;s need no guidance, perver&s;ene&s;s no correc|tion, weakne&s;s, no &s;trength? Mu&s;t no cele&s;tial light &s;hine on the night of affliction? No immortal hope beam on the darkne&s;s of the grave? We are taught to believe that religion is the only &s;upport of moral|ity, and revelation of religion. Unaided rea&s;on, unable to &s;olve the difficulties of natural religion, proves the blind leader of the blind; and after al|luring her followers by fal&s;e and glimmering lights, leaves them enveloped with the darkne&s;s of athei&s;m. Under the pavilion of religion only, can &s;ociety find a covert from that tempe&s;t of the pa&s;&s;ions, which is ever ready to bur&s;t upon its head. Religion lays her hand on the movements of the heart, and directs her eye into the haunts of &s;ecret iniquity. She awes the in&s;olence of the high, and repre&s;&s;es the envy of the of the low. De&s;troy her influence, and univer&s;al tyranny en&s;ues. Every man in power, knowing that others have no re&s;traint from crimes but want of opportunity, will by every means keep the weak

Thus ev|ery man's hand is again&s;t every man, and &s;ociety is a den of wild bea&s;ts.</P>
<P>THESE are &s;ome of the <HI>principles,</HI> which we have received from our ance&s;tors. They have not been wholly ineffectual to produce pure <HI>morals,</HI> &s;oft and &s;ocial <HI>manners.</HI> Notwith&s;tanding the relaxation of of our &s;entiments and practices from tho&s;e of our ance&s;tors, we &s;till keep &s;o near to them, that it is hon|orable in the public opinion, to be rich without luxury and oppre&s;&s;ion, to be poor without envy and di&s;hone&s;ty; to be ju&s;t, faithful, and cha&s;te. We tru&s;t there is but a &s;mall minority in our country, who are &s;o venal as to put up their con&s;ciences to &s;ale; &s;o abject, as to be the willing tools of ba&s;e pur|po&s;es; &s;o abandoned, as to become the panders of crime. We are not yet &s;o dive&s;ted of the prejudices of education, and the maxims of the nur&s;ery, that the in|&s;ulter of woman, the de&s;poiler of innocence, the con|temner of age; the cruel or unfaithful hu&s;band, the the undutiful or thankle&s;s child, can e&s;cape dete&s;ta|tion. With our pre&s;ent character, had we a revolu|tionary tribunal, it would probably be difficult to find one father the accu&s;er of his &s;on, one wife of her hu&s;band, one brother of his brother.

<P>SUCH is a brief repre&s;entation of the principles, manners, and in&s;titutions, which have de&s;cended to us from our ance&s;tors, and de&s;erve to be maintained and tran&s;mitted pure to our po&s;terity. But have they been thus maintained? Will they be thus tran&s;mit|ed? There are &s;pots in thy garments, my country. There is &s;omewhat again&s;t thee, becau&s;e thou ha&s;t left thy fir&s;t love. Many of thy children have de|generated from that &s;pirit of order and religion, which marked the precepts and the example of their fathers. Let us inquire by what means we have been &s;educed from their path, and by what means we may regain and pre&s;erve it. Our conte&s;t for indepen|dence, by keeping our rights &s;o much in view, drew our attention from our duties; and in our zeal to decorate liberty with her cap, we for a time forgot to arm law with her &s;word. The interruption of the cour&s;e of ju&s;tice, the fluctuation of property, the paper medium and tender laws, and the foreign connexions, which &s;prung out of war, were &s;o many channels for the introduction of licentiou&s;ne&s;s; and the pro&s;perity which attended peace and neutrality, has been lulling to &s;leep reflection and public virtue in her luxurious lap: whil&s;t de|riving
<PB N="18" REF="033963_0017_0FF9DE35B6BAF4B0">corruption from internal &s;ources, we have felt the bane of foreign influence, and been "contam|inated with the foul abominations of the revolution in France." With credulous fondne&s;s we pre&s;&s;ed her to our bo&s;oms; and &s;he has bitten like a &s;erpent, and &s;tung like an adder. The pe&s;tilence, which &s;he &s;ent forth, to walk in darkne&s;s, and wa&s;te at noon day, here met con&s;titutions predi&s;po&s;ed to its reception. The &s;eeds of her democracy, her infidelity, and im|morality, being &s;own with tho&s;e of our own &s;oil, they have been growing up together into rank luxuriance and &s;preading from field to field.</P>
<P>THANKS to the God of our fathers, who&s;e provi|dence has led us to di&s;cover the tares, which the fo|reign and dome&s;tic enemy have &s;cattered, and rou&s;|ed us to unite, in plucking them up by their roots. We would not hear him in the whi&s;pers of his mer|cy; and he has kindly awakened us by the thunders of his judgments. Thoughtle&s;s and ungrateful, we neglected our government in her pro&s;perity; but her day of trial has engaged our hearts and hands, rich|es and &s;trength in her &s;upport. We could not pre&s;erve our connexion with our Gallic ally in her pre&s;ent &s;tate, without the lo&s;s of freedom and virtue; and that connexion is mercifully broken. Her friend|&s;hip would have proved our infamy; and we are honored with her enmity; and are taught the impi|ety and folly of having &s;uppo&s;ed there could be com|munion
<PB N="19" REF="033963_0018_0FF9C09C22F0C748">between chri&s;tians and athei&s;ts, freemen and tyrants. We have returned to our&s;elves, and are Am|ericans. We &s;ee the precipice on which we have &s;tood and are eagerly &s;tepping back. May the enthu&s;i|a&s;m, in the cau&s;e of our altars and laws, which the exigency has kindled, become a habit of our &s;ouls, and live, a ve&s;tal fire, in every American bo&s;om.</P>
<P>RESISTANCE is begun on the &s;ea. Events may demand it on our &s;hores. In a cau&s;e like ours, what chri&s;tian or patriot, will not dare to combat and to peri&s;h? Should the fortune of war allot him the cypre&s;s for the laurel, it will quicken the la&s;t beat of his heart, to reflect that he dies to &s;ave his country. And &s;hould &s;he not be &s;aved, but the inexplicable &s;cheme of Providence &s;uffer her to &s;ink under the overwhelming ruin let loo&s;e upon the world, we may be a&s;&s;ured that before &s;uch an event, all her be&s;t blood will be &s;hed; that exi&s;tence here to a true American will be wor&s;e than ten thou&s;and deaths, and to have been an early victim in her cau&s;e will be a favored lot.</P>
<P>WHILST we unite in the defence of our country, let us unite in rendering and pre&s;erving her worthy to be defended. To this end let the pure principles, the virtuous manners, and the u&s;eful in&s;titutions, in|herited from our ance&s;tors, be retained and perfect|ed. Be not carried about by every wind of politi|cal doctrine; but inflexibly adhere to the maxims
<PB N="20" REF="033963_0019_0FF9C0ADF7182040">and forms of government which you have received; and cling to their admini&s;tration with the gra&s;p of death. Maintain order and in&s;truction in your families; and provide liberally for the means of education. If you wi&s;h to keep alive religion in your&s;elves or others, &s;uffer not your &s;undays to be perverted to amu&s;e|ment, your bibles to be the lumber of your &s;helves, or your churches to be neglected. Let your literary &s;ons aim as well to be good as great; le&s;t know|ledge multiply the objects of de&s;ire, whil&s;t it leaves them de&s;titute of principle to direct their choice and pur&s;uit of tho&s;e objects; and &s;uperior talents be only qualifications for more exten&s;ive mi&s;chief. Let tho&s;e, who become members of this ancient &s;em|inary, be ju&s;t to its eminent advantages, draw a re|&s;pectful veil over imperfections more or le&s;s in&s;epa|rable from every human in&s;titution; and never permit that &s;pirit of mi&s;rule, which &s;courges the world and menaces the &s;tate, to di&s;turb and di&s;|honor this cho&s;en retreat. Let your &s;ons and daugh|ters be &s;en&s;ible that virtue, and not wealth, fame plea&s;ure, beauty, or accompli&s;hments is their chief good. Our fair countrywomen, e&s;pecially are invited to recollect the indi&s;putable truth, that the &s;pirit of chri&s;tianity has contributed more than any thing to give them the re&s;pectable and de&s;erved rank, which they now hold in &s;ociety in <HI>Europe</HI> and <HI>America.</HI>&mdash;This &s;pirit, by making the marriage contract indi&s;&s;o|luble,
<PB N="21" REF="033963_0020_0FF9C0A2009BEA10">and repre&s;enting woman as endowed with the &s;ame intellectual and moral nature as man, has en|forced his re&s;pect; and rai&s;ed her from being the drudge of his indolence, or the in&s;trument of his plea&s;ure, to be his companion, his equal, his coun&s;el|lor, and his friend. Far from our youth be tho&s;e ab&s;urd and unnatural manners, which the innovat|ing &s;pirit of the times has made fa&s;hionable, which di&s;regard the gradations and di&s;tinctions of nature and &s;ociety; and placing the young on a level with the old, the child with the parent, and the pupil with the in&s;tructer, annul the claim of age to re&s;pect, and of authority to &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>THE poi&s;on of the &s;keptical and di&s;organizing philo&s;ophy, which is now perverting and corrupting man, has been admini&s;tered in writings, many of which want no confidence of a&s;&s;ertion to overawe, no &s;ubtilty of argument to perplex, no &s;prightline&s;s of wit to amu&s;e, and no charms of eloquence to en|tice. But whil&s;t to indulge curio&s;ity, to ta&s;te the beauties of compo&s;ition, or to gratify the vanity of general reading we peru&s;e them; it is at the hazard of being entangled in their &s;ophi&s;try, and depraved by their immoral &s;entiments. It is proper advice to all, at lea&s;t to &s;uch, who&s;e minds are immature, and who&s;e habits are unformed; look not into their in|fectious pages. Tread not on the bed of flowers, un|der which a &s;erpent lurks. "What! forbid free in|quiry?"
<PB N="22" REF="033963_0021_0FF9DE42979FAF08">Forbid imprudent, ra&s;h, indi&s;criminate in|quiry; inquiry which can do us little good; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> do us infinite mi&s;chief.

Will the traveller, who wi&s;he, to &s;ecure an agreea|ble journey, for&s;ake the beaten road at the peril of being entangled in inextricable wilds? Believe not that di&s;coveries are to be made in morality; or that any way will be found of exi&s;ting happily in this world, or in the next, but that which the Lord our God hath illuminated with the brightne&s;s of a &s;unbeam, "Do ju&s;tly, love mercy, and walk humbly with thy God." The&s;e men cant about univer&s;al benevolence, &s;en&s;ibility, and morality. Di&s;intere&s;ted benevolence! which teaches, that the vile&s;t means are con&s;ecrated by a benevolent end, and that it is noble to de&s;troy the parts to &s;erve the whole. Sweet &s;en&s;ibility! which feels for every thing except that which tou|ches it; for all mankind, except tho&s;e with whom it is in contact, and to whom it may be u&s;eful; which weeps over the inju&s;tice of governments, and &s;ends its children to the ho&s;pital. Rigid morality! which is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> with the vices of &s;ociety, and charmed
<PB N="23" REF="033963_0022_0FF9C0A68A732FA8">with the purity of the natural &s;tate, yet writes licen|tious novels for the rich, which plants a &s;ting in the con&s;cience for &s;tealing an apple, and &s;educes a wife, and betrays a friend, without &s;elf reproach.</P>
<P>WHATEVER fa&s;cination there might be to &s;ome fanatical or corrupt minds, in the principles of the nation, which the&s;e philo&s;ophers have put into their crucible, one would think there could be none to any in their conduct. For any to approve or ju&s;tify, mu&s;t be to re&s;emble it. But the mo&s;t virtuous need to guard again&s;t the effect of familiarity with &s;uch enormous vice in blunting the moral &s;en&s;ibility. So pe&s;tilential is its nature, that to look at it is dan|gerous, to look at it with the lea&s;t indulgence is pol|lution, to embrace it is death.</P>
<P>AMERICANS, whil&s;t you &s;tudy improvement, &s;hrink from innovation. Difficult enough is the pre|&s;ervation of order with all the aid, which it derives from antiquity, authority, opinion, and habit. Re|member, that confidence not jealou&s;y is the fir&s;t of republican virtues; that to &s;ettle, not change our ci|vil &s;y&s;tems is the bu&s;ine&s;s of our time, and that the &s;pirit of complaint and oppo&s;ition &s;hould be re&s;erv|ed for the medicine of the Con&s;titution, when it &s;hall grow old and di&s;ea&s;ed, and not admini&s;tered as its daily food, while it is in the bloom of youth and of health. Such empirici&s;m, will &s;oon make it as
<PB N="24" REF="033963_0023_0FF9DE5128B72438">di&s;ordered as its enemies pretend: and drug it into a malady, which has no cure, but death.</P>
<P>IF, as men, as members of &s;ociety, and chri&s;tians, we will be thus in&s;tructed, we &s;hall obtain, for our country all the happine&s;s, which a nation can po&s;|&s;e&s;s in this &s;tate of mingled good and evil, and for our&s;elves the unfailing con&s;olation of an approving mind, and a tru&s;t in God in this world; and beyond the line of time, a reward, va&s;t as our de&s;ires, and la&s;ting as our exi&s;tence.</P>
