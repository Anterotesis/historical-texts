<P>Nothing that I have &s;aid, or &s;hall &s;ay, on this &s;ubject, is intended to ju&s;tify the Briti&s;h in their im|pre&s;&s;ment of <HI>Americans:</HI> I look upon their conduct in this re&s;pect as tyrannical; as the effect of that overbearing in&s;olence which is the characteri&s;tic of but too many among their &s;ubaltern officers, and I think that redre&s;s ought to be obtained, with all convenient &s;peed. But, I here confine my&s;elf to <HI>Americans alone,</HI> by which word I mean, tho&s;e who were born in the United States, or were inhabi|tants of them at the peace of 1783, not including <HI>de&s;erters from the Briti&s;h during the war.</HI> The&s;e are Americans, and no others are, and, I venture to predict, that, whatever &s;chemes the Congre&s;s may fall on, whatever regi&s;ters, certificates or oaths of civi&s;m they may think proper to furni&s;h &s;ailors with, Great Britain will ever &s;eize hers, where &s;he finds them.</P>
<P>Mr. LIVINGSTON &s;aid, that <Q>it would be no difficult matter to prove, that foreigners natural|ized &s;ince the Declaration of Independence, were entitled to the protection of the govern|ment.</Q> He attempted to prove this, and I &s;hall not contradict him, for the thing is, in it&s;elf &s;o evidently ab&s;urd as to need no remark.&mdash;As to what he plea&s;es to call the <HI>naturalization of foreigners</HI> (whole cargoes at a time or otherwi&s;e) the rights of citizen&s;hip they enjoy under their new ma&s;ters, &amp;c. &amp;c. &s;hall be re&s;erved for a future opportunity. It will be &s;ufficient to add, on this article, that a bill was at la&s;t agreed to for appointing agents for the relief and protection of impre&s;&s;ed &s;eamen. But if the&s;e agents are to be employed (as the in&s;tru|ments

<HEAD>PAPERS RELATIVE TO THE TREATY WITH GREAT BRITAIN. <DATE><HI>MARCH</HI> 2nd.</DATE></HEAD>
<P>Mr. LIVINGSTON (from N. York) &s;aid that it was ge|nerally under&s;tood that &s;ome important con&s;titutional que|&s;tions would be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, when the treaty lately conclud|ed between this country and Great Britain &s;hould come under con&s;ideration, it was very de&s;irable, therefore, that every document which might tend to throw light on the &s;ubject &s;hould be before the Hou&s;e.&mdash;For this purpo&s;e, he would move the following re&s;olution:</P>
<P><Q>Re&s;olved, that the Pre&s;ident of the United States be reque&s;ted to lay before this Hou&s;e, a copy of the in|&s;tructions given to the mini&s;ter of the United States who negociated the treaty with Great Britain, commu|nicated by his me&s;&s;age on the 1&s;t in&s;t. together with the corre&s;pondence and documents relative to the &s;aid treaty.</Q> Ordered to lie on the table.</P>
<P>To this re&s;olution the following exception was after|wards added:&mdash;<Q>excepting &s;uch of &s;aid papers as any exi&s;ting negociation may render improper to be di&s;|clo&s;ed.</Q></P>
<P>Mr. TRACEY (Connecticut) reque&s;ted the gentleman who brought forward this re&s;olution to give his rea&s;ons for doing &s;o. He had at pre&s;ent only told the Hou&s;e that, as the con&s;titutionality of the treaty might be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, he thought it nece&s;&s;ary to propo&s;e the mea&s;ure. It was well known by every man in that Hou&s;e that much differ|ence of opinion, and much &s;en&s;ibility had been occa&s;ioned by the treaty in que&s;tion all over the Union.&mdash;He thought that the only way to treat the matter fairly, would be for every member on that floor to come forward and expre&s;s him&s;elf openly. Perhaps the happine&s;s of the country
<PB N="74" REF="030221_0006_0FE5283907F71FA0">
might depend upon the i&s;&s;ue of their deliberations upon it. In order to avoid all bitterne&s;s and mi&s;under&s;tanding, it would be be&s;t for members to come forward at fir&s;t and &s;tate their opinions fully. He, therefore a&s;ked why this motion was made? If made barely to enable the Hou&s;e to examine into the con&s;titutionality of the treaty, he thought that might be determined by comparing it with the con&s;titution it&s;elf. It may be thought nece&s;&s;ary that the&s;e papers be produced in order to impeach any of the per&s;ons employed in the negociation, or the Precident. He wi&s;hed to know for what purpo&s;e the&s;e papers are called. He thought to declare the whole intention of the motion would be a means of harmonizing the Hou&s;e upon the &s;ubject. However, until he knew the real intention, he would hope it was a good one. If he di&s;agreed from the honourable mover, he &s;hould give his rea&s;ons for it, it was a delicate &s;ubject. That they had a right to the papers called for for a good purpo&s;e, could not be doubted, but unle&s;s the Hou&s;e had real occa&s;ion for them, the Pre&s;ident would be ju&s;tified, in keeping them where they are. What, &s;aid he, do we want with the&s;e papers? Is it to make a better treaty, or to do away the one made? He wi&s;hed to know the mover's rea&s;ons fully.</P>
<P>Mr. LIVINGSTON &s;aid he had never any wi&s;h to con|ceal his intention, as he tru&s;ted he never &s;hould have any which he &s;hould be a&s;hamed to avow. The gentleman a&s;ked with propriety for information: he an&s;wered, his motion was made for the purpo&s;e of gaining information. He a&s;ked to what particular point. It may be to all the points he has mentioned. It was impo&s;&s;ible to know un|til the papers were before him. He wi&s;hed for infor|mation, the re&s;ult would depend upon the information re|ceived. He did not know that the impeachment of any per&s;on would be determined upon by that Hou&s;e. He did not think &s;o him&s;elf; but he thought it nece&s;&s;ary they &s;hould have an opportunity of making a fair judgment of the matter. They were the proper per&s;ons to whom was delegated the power of puni&s;hing officers; they ought therefore, to have full opportunity of judging of their conduct. It was &s;imply for information that the re&s;olu|tion a&s;ked, not only with re&s;pect to the officers who were employed on the occa&s;ion, but with re&s;pect to the thing
<PB N="75" REF="030221_0007_0FE5283A996AE5A0">
it&s;elf. He believed, that Hou&s;e had the power to carry into effect any Treaty, or not. It was for this purpo&s;e that he wanted information; and if the Hou&s;e were of the &s;ame opinion, they would &s;upport the motion. Some|thing had been &s;aid as to the delicacy of the &s;ubject. If, &s;aid he, any rea&s;on of State will not permit the Pre&s;ident to give the papers they a&s;ked for, he will give his rea&s;ons for refu&s;ing them. He meant not to invade the rights of any branch of government; it was information which he &s;ought for.</P>
<P>Mr. GILES (Virginia) &s;aid he would briefly &s;tate the rea&s;ons which induced him to &s;upport the pa&s;&s;ing of the re&s;olution which lay on the table. The gentleman from Connecticut had ju&s;tly &s;aid that the treaty had cau&s;ed great &s;en&s;ibility throughout the United States. It was on this account that he wanted that information which they had a right to expect, and without which they could not pro|ceed to con&s;ider the &s;ubject. If he were to judge of the treaty it&s;elf, it would not allay that &s;en&s;ibility which had been rai&s;ed again&s;t it, but he tru&s;ted the information which was called for would be of a &s;ort to reconcile the public mind. If no information was given he mu&s;t own it would have an unfavorable impre&s;&s;ion on his mind. He wi&s;hed, therefore, for information.</P>
<P>Mr. MURRAY (Maryland) ob&s;erved that if the mover of the re&s;olution before the Hou&s;e had clearly declared that the object of it was for information, he &s;hould not have an objection to it; but the explanation given, led him to be|lieve that it had in view the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a very alarm|ing doctrine&mdash;no le&s;s than to determine whether the trea|ty &s;hall be carried into effect or not. By the Con&s;titution, he &s;aid, the treaty was become the law of the land, and obligatory on all the citizens of the United States. From the explanation given, he &s;hould give the mea&s;ure his de|cided negative; for if that Hou&s;e had the power to decide on the legality of the treaty, in vain has the Con&s;titution given power to the Pre&s;ident and Senate to make treaties. It appeared to him that the Hou&s;e had no right to enquire into the particular ground upon which this treaty has be|come the law of the land, &s;ince it appears that the Pre&s;i|dent and Senate have acted agreeably to the Con&s;titution.
<PB N="76" REF="030221_0008_0FE527596F2A0150">
It would be a &s;oleci&s;m in Government, to &s;ay that there were two powers which could controul each other. He thought the re&s;olution uncon&s;titutional, as it was predi|cated on the right of that Hou&s;e to interfere with the pow|er placed in the Pre&s;ident and Senate to make treaties. In order to ju&s;tify this motion, the Hou&s;e &s;hould fir&s;t de|termine the treaty to be uncon&s;titutional, and that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> not to be the law of the land. If it was agreed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> Hou&s;e had a right to examine all the &s;ecrets <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> negociations, a plan will be adopted which may open &s;e+crets that may be of great injury to the nation. Every man knows, &s;aid he, that in diplomatic tran&s;actions there are certain &s;ecret negociations; he did not know that it was the ca&s;e in this, but it might be &s;o. To carry into effect this re&s;olution, appeared to him a direct inva&s;ion upon the con&s;titutional rights placed in the Pre&s;ident, in conjunction with the Senate. He doubted whether the Senate could make this demand.</P>
<P>Thus did the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion wander from its object. This motion of Mr. Living&s;ton was the &s;ignal of ho&s;tile preparation. The Friends of the treaty took the alarm, and the que&s;tion became, not whether the Hou&s;e had a right to call for the pa|pers or not, but whether their &s;anction was nece&s;|&s;ary to the execution of a treaty.</P>
<P>The debates occupied the Hou&s;e and the pub|lic during nearly a month. It is incompatible with my plan to give all the &s;peeches at length, many of which do honour to the hearts and ma|ny others to the heads of the &s;peakers: among the former may be noticed tho&s;e of Me&s;&s;ieurs Buck, Sedgwick, Harper and William Smith; among the latter, tho&s;e of Me&s;&s;ieurs Gallatin and Giles; and, on the whole, the debate contains as ma&s;terly a di&s;play of polemical talents as, perhaps, was ever exhibited by any a&s;&s;embly in the world.</P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="030221_0009_0FE5287860BFB290">I &s;hall content my&s;elf with in&s;erting here two of the&s;e &s;peeches only, which as they contain the &s;ub&s;tance of all that was &s;aid on both &s;ides, will &s;uffice, at once to give the reader a complete view of the arguments adduced, and a &s;pecimen of the rhetorical abilities of the members of the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives.</P>
<P>Mr. GILES &s;aid, when the pre&s;ent motion was fir&s;t brought forward, he &s;aw no other con&s;ideration attached to it, than the expediency, or inexpediency of calling for the papers in que&s;tion. It was expected the Pre&s;ident was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of information re&s;pecting the treaty, as &s;uch it became a que&s;tion whether it was not proper to make a call for it. The very referring of the treaty to a com|mittee of the whole &s;hewed an intention of acting upon it. Indeed the communication from the Pre&s;ident at the opening of the &s;e&s;&s;ion, &s;hewed that he expected that Hou&s;e to exerci&s;e an agency on the treaty. It appeared to him, that if the papers would &s;erve to explain any thing in the treaty, it was de&s;ireable to have them. He was one of tho&s;e who, in reflecting on the treaty, and judging from the face of it, felt unfavorably towards it. He was per|&s;waded that he had the right, and he conceived it to be his duty, to oppo&s;e the execution of, the in&s;trument; but, knowing there was great re&s;pon&s;ibility attached to the bu&s;ine&s;s, he wi&s;hed for information. For the final i&s;&s;ue, the weight of re&s;pon&s;ibility would never make him &s;werve from his duty. The&s;e were his motives for con|curring in the motion.</P>
<P>That the Hou&s;e had a right to call for the&s;e papers was not denied; the right being conceded, it appeared to him that they might have confined them&s;elves to the expediency of the motion. But the oppo&s;ition had not been &s;o much again&s;t the motion, as again&s;t the argu|ments which have been u&s;ed, that do not relate to the &s;ubject. But tho' he believed that the&s;e were all the con|&s;equences, yet, as it &s;eemed to be deemed a te&s;t re&s;pect|ing another bu&s;ine&s;s, and members appeared inclined now to expre&s;s an opinion on that head, he would a&s;k indul|gence
<PB N="78" REF="030221_0010_0FE52815C362B6E8">
of the committee whil&s;t he &s;tated his &s;entiments on that &s;ubject.</P>
<P>The real que&s;tion appeared to be this, whether the treaty making power, can receive any check, in con&s;e|quence of provi&s;ions placed in the Congre&s;s of the United States, and whether they have a right to que&s;tion the me|rits of the in&s;truments?&mdash;Various arguments have been u&s;ed to &s;hew, that that Hou&s;e have not the power to ex|amine the treaty, or check its execution. Some of them have grown from the Con&s;titution, others from the face of the in&s;trument. Though, he &s;aid, it would have been more agreeable to him to have explained his &s;entiments in a different way, yet, as gentlemen have cho&s;en to en|ter upon the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the great Con&s;titutional que&s;ti|on, he &s;hould proceed to an&s;wer the objections which had been urged again&s;t what he conceived to be the pow|ers of that a&s;&s;embly.</P>
<P>Of the de&s;cription of objection again&s;t the rights of that Hou&s;e, which grew out of the in&s;trument it&s;elf, he &s;hould begin with remarks on what had fallen from the gentleman from South Carolina ye&s;terday. That gentle|man had introduced the Convention held in the &s;tate of Virginia near the time of adopting the Con&s;titution, and &s;aid, that it propo&s;ed an amendment, containing, among&s;t other checks, one re&s;pecting the treaty power, viz. that there &s;hould be a concurrence of two thirds of the whole of the Senate, in&s;tead of two thirds of the Senate pre&s;ent. He believed it was &s;o. But he would a&s;k the gentleman how this operated? The amendment was not to le&s;&s;en, but to increa&s;e the checks, which, from the extent of the treaty making power, as it &s;tands in the Con&s;titution, was thought to be nece&s;&s;ary. But how the gentleman could infer that they believed there was no other check, he was at a lo&s;s to determine. If he would refer to the proceed|ings of that Convention, he would find the rea&s;ons urged in &s;upport of the propo&s;ed amendments, which, indeed, were the opinions of individuals only. The next con&s;i|deration which he re&s;orted to was, that of the opinion of certain citizens, at a meeting held at New-York, to &s;hew that they con&s;idered the bu&s;ine&s;s of the treaty, wholly an executive bu&s;ine&s;s. He little expected, from a gentleman
<PB N="79" REF="030221_0011_0FE527952199C2C8">
who is apt to &s;peak rather contemptuou&s;ly of &s;uch a&s;&s;em|blies, that the proceedings of town's meeting &s;hould have been adduced in &s;upport of his argument. He ac|knowledged that the expre&s;&s;ions of &s;uch meetings of the people would always have an effect on his mind. Was the gentleman willing to rely on the opinions of tho&s;e whom he has mentioned? If not, why introduce them? If the gentleman will admit that &s;uch meetings are the or|thodox expo&s;itors of the public Con&s;titution, as they are expo&s;itors of the will, he had no objections to their being adduced. It did not appear, however, that he drew cor|rectly the &s;entiments of the public meeting in que&s;tion; it was held to petition the Pre&s;ident to withhold his &s;igna|ture from the treaty. Would not the &s;tronge&s;t arguments, then, be u&s;ed to induce the Pre&s;ident not to execute the treaty? But he wi&s;hed to be permitted to take the gentle|man's own rule. What was the &s;ituation of their table; was it not covered with petitions from all parts of the Union again&s;t the treaty? Finding their petitions in vain to the Pre&s;ident, the people flew to that Hou&s;e, and the table never had, upon any occa&s;ion, &s;o many petitions up|on it, praying them not to give up the rights which the con&s;titution had placed in their hands, of checking the treaty making power.&mdash;The next argument adduced by the gentleman was, the opinion expre&s;&s;ed in the amend|ments lately propo&s;ed by the State of Virginia, to the con&s;titution; from which, he drew an implication that there was at pre&s;ent no check on the treaty making power, it was not &s;o. It had not been contended that there was any particular words in the con&s;titution which directly goes to this con&s;truction, but that it grows out of ano|ther powers. This was the idea of the State of Virginia. The amendment was propo&s;ed to relieve them from con|&s;tructive power, by giving them an expre&s;s power. It was unnece&s;&s;ary to remind them of the fate which the&s;e amendments had met with. He hoped, however, the State of Virginia would per&s;ue that conduct which had always marked her political character; and he tru&s;ted it would be admitted, that &s;he was not more di&s;tingui&s;hed for her love of liberty, than &s;he was for her love of vir|tue, of order and good conduct at home. He prided him&s;elf in being a Repre&s;entative of &s;uch a &s;tate; and he
<PB N="80" REF="030221_0012_0FE528A35242ED40">
was per&s;uaded, though her &s;i&s;ter &s;tates differed from her in opinion, &s;he would never cea&s;e to pay them proper re&s;pect. He was &s;orry the &s;ubject had been mentioned. If Virginia, he &s;aid, had been the cau&s;e of indelicacy in others, &s;he was the innocent cau&s;e and therefore not re|&s;pon&s;ible. In making the propo&s;ed amendments, &s;he was impelled by the be&s;t motives to attain an important object, an object, which, he doubted not, would ultimately be attended with &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>The gentleman from South-Carolina had re&s;orted to another &s;ubject with but little &s;ucce&s;s. He read a re&s;o|lution from the journals of the hou&s;e, importing, that when treaties were made under the authority of the United States, they &s;hould be annexed to the laws.</P>
<P>He believed it proper they &s;hould be &s;o. But does this &s;hew that the practice of the Hou&s;e had been again&s;t ex|pre&s;&s;ing their opinion on great national objects? The gentleman's next ob&s;ervation was with re&s;pect to appro|priations for carrying into effect Indian treaties, &s;aying that there was no difference betwixt treaties with foreign nations, and treaties with the Indian tribes. Mr. Giles remarked there always had been a di&s;tinction.&mdash;In the time of the Colonial Government, that di&s;tinction was made and it had never been done away. By means of Indian treaties, the treaty-making power had been va&s;tly increa&s;|ed, he could not &s;ay whether for a good or bad purpo&s;e. Provi&s;ion had been made for carrying Indian treaties in|to effect, becau&s;e they thought it right. But &s;uppo&s;e a motion had been made to &s;trike out the appropriation clau&s;e, in one of tho&s;e bills, would it have been out of order? No. That que&s;tion had been lately di&s;cu&s;&s;ed (he referred to the bu&s;ine&s;s re&s;pecting the mint) and determi|ned upon. There was another &s;ubject that gentleman mentioned, which he was very &s;orry to hear, though he &s;eemed to plume him&s;elf upon it, that the Pre&s;ident of the United States had accompanied the publication of this treaty with his proclamation to carry it into effect. Why was this mentioned? It was not to illuminate that Hou&s;e. He was afraid it might have a tendency to check inve&s;ti|gation. Per&s;ons were too often brought before that Hou&s;e; not to illu&s;trate a &s;ubject, but to hinder free debate. He
<PB N="81" REF="030221_0013_0FE528416105DF68">
would even admit that the Pre&s;ident believed that that Hou&s;e had not the right to judge of the treaty. Were his opinion to be authority? No. What is the nature of the que&s;tion? It implies conte&s;ted rights of different branch|es of government. His introducing the Pre&s;ident, there|fore, as an authoritative opinion, might alarm, but could not convince. Notwith&s;tanding the Pre&s;ident's proclama|tion, he &s;till thought the treaty was &s;ent to that Hou&s;e to be acted upon.</P>
<P>Having an&s;wered mo&s;t of the objections from collateral &s;ources, he &s;hould proceed to more intere&s;ting matter&mdash; to the Con&s;titution it&s;elf, it was a little unfortunate, he &s;aid, that &s;entiments could not be &s;o combined as to pro|duce always the &s;ame ideas in every mind. Hence aro&s;e difference of opinion.&mdash;It is not wonderful, that in the Congre&s;s of the United States, there &s;hould be a variety of opinion. Of all the expo&s;itions of the treaty-making power, he thought that was the lea&s;t probable and mo&s;t dangerous, which fell from the member from Connecti|cut&mdash;That power, he informed the Hou&s;e, was undefined in its nature, unlimited in its object, and &s;upreme in its operation. He would not &s;ay there had been no attempts at a definition of this extravagant power. It was &s;aid, it might embrace legi&s;lative objects by compacts. He would not &s;ay that objection had been attended to, that it could not go beyond the Con&s;titution, nor encroach on power placed by the Con&s;titution in any branch of Government.</P>
<P>On this con&s;truction he would examine the que&s;tion. The fir&s;t con&s;equence was, that the treaty &s;upercedes the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of that Hou&s;e. The next was, that it repeals all laws which &s;tand in its way. When he proceeded to examine the con&s;titution, he would touch on both tho&s;e particulars. He would remark, that as far as he had been able to examine the hi&s;tory of mankind, there was always an effort of the people to guard their rights, and an op|po&s;ite effort in government to encroach on them. The American people were called upon to e&s;tabli&s;h &s;uch a con|&s;titution as would en&s;ure their rights and liberties. It had been &s;aid that the American people had been more &s;agaci|ous than any other nation. But whil&s;t it appears that they have been more &s;agacious to furni&s;h checks, there have not
<PB N="82" REF="030221_0014_0FE52796AC1752B0">
been wanting continual attempts to invade them. In no nation has the doctrine of checks been &s;o completely routed as in this, and if the opinions now contended for, prevail, nothing will remain to be done by checks. This con&s;truction has been deduced from two &s;ources. One from the con&s;titution, and the other from the nature of the thing. Gentlemen have read the clau&s;e of the con&s;ti|tution which gives a power to the Pre&s;ident and Senate to make treaties. Here they &s;top, and &s;ay that this gives them a complete authority. If there was no other clau&s;e, it might be &s;o. But let the que&s;tion be examined. The gentlemen then re&s;ort to another clau&s;e, viz. <Q>This con|&s;titution, and the laws of the United States which &s;hall be made in pur&s;uance thereof, and all treaties made, or which &s;hall be made under the authority of the United States, &s;hall be the &s;upreme law of the land.</Q> Here they &s;top again, and if there were no other words, it would &s;eem to &s;upport their doctrine. But the clau&s;e ex|plains it&s;elf, <Q>and the judges in every &s;tate &s;hall be bound thereby, any thing in the con&s;titution or laws of any &s;tate to the contrary notwith&s;tanding.</Q> Can any thing be more evident, that this clau&s;e relates to former en|croachments of particular &s;tates? It was nece&s;&s;ary that the con&s;titution and laws of each &s;tate &s;hould yield to the general Government. Gentlemen finding difficulties oc|cur, contend for the &s;upremacy of treaties over all laws. It is admitted the clau&s;es of the con&s;titution will not &s;up|port this: and he would a&s;k where they found the doc|trine, that treaties are &s;uperior to laws? Gentlemen &s;ay that it is from the nature of things. He believed the rever&s;e. In this point he differed from the gentleman from Penn&s;ylvania; for he would contend that laws could annul treaties, but that treaties could not annul laws. This being a new doctrine, he would beg leave to illu&s;|trate it. He inferred it from the nature of the two pow|ers. Gentlemen a&s;&s;ert that treaties cannot be repealed, becau&s;e they con&s;i&s;t of two parts, and nothing le&s;s than the con&s;ent of both, or war, can annul them. He would a&s;k that Hou&s;e, if they ever heard of a convention be|tween two foreign nations for this purpo&s;e? if it could be done, he &s;hould wi&s;h another envoy extraordinary to be appointed and &s;ent to repeal this treaty. But no &s;uch meeting having ever taken place, from whence comes this
<PB N="83" REF="030221_0015_0FE52786AE88F6C0">
theory? But is it rea&s;onable that laws &s;hould repeal trea|ties? Yes. But why? becau&s;e laws were the expre&s;&s;ion of the national will, through its proper organ.</P>
<P>It is admitted on all hands, &s;aid Mr. Giles, that Con|gre&s;s has the power of declaring war; &s;uppo&s;e it did de|clare war with Great Britain, would not the treaty be an|nulled? would the treaty operate during the war? No. At lea&s;t that part of it which &s;peaks of mutual amity, would be de&s;troyed. He would go farther, the treaty makes an equalization of duties in the Canada trade. Could not this regulation be repealed? but this it might be &s;aid, would lead to war. That might be; but he contended for the right. He &s;aid that a law pro tanto renders the treaty void. Suppo&s;e Great Britain by her parliament, were to repeal any law relative the treaty, what would be the con&s;equence? Great Britain would make her&s;elf re&s;pon&s;ible. True; but &s;he might do it. Treaties were &s;aid not to be repealable; was not that &s;ay|ing that the laws of the United States were like the laws of the Medes and Per&s;ians, which change not? if gentle|men took time to examine the doctrine they would find it le&s;s &s;ound than they expected.</P>
<P>In proportion as an authority was &s;uppo&s;ed to be un|limited or undefined, in the &s;ame proportion was the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of a check upon it. When he looked into the con&s;titution, he found this check. Would it not, indeed have been the height of folly in the people to have given unbounded power with re&s;pect to making treaties, whil&s;t &s;ome of the regulations in the con&s;titution give in&s;tances of well founded jealou&s;y in their rulers? if the doctrine contended for were ju&s;t, it would afford a remarkable in|&s;tance of the folly of the American people.</P>
<P>The con&s;titution, he &s;aid, contained a di&s;tribution of powers. It had three di&s;tinct checks. The fir&s;t related to the different &s;pecies of authority. Each di&s;tinct au|thority was placed in &s;eparate hands. The next was, the &s;ame &s;pecies of authority is placed in two different branch|es of the government, which renders a concurrence of opi|nion nece&s;&s;ary to any act. Another check, or denial of
<PB N="84" REF="030221_0016_0FE52777E17FFD20">
authority altogether, was the qualified veto of the Pre&s;i|dent.</P>
<P>As an in&s;tance of the caution which the people thought nece&s;&s;ary again&s;t the encroachment of power, it was made an article of the con&s;titution that no appropriation for an army could he made for more than two years. By which it appears that they were not &s;atisfied, though they had provided that there &s;hould be a concurrence of &s;entiment in the Senate and Legi&s;lature, but determined to prevent the po&s;ibility of keeping up an army e&s;tabli&s;hment longer than nece&s;&s;ary. Another check was the biennial elections, as every new election was con&s;idered as a fre&s;h check up|on the executive. No one will doubt that this was the motive; and the doctrine at pre&s;ent in&s;i&s;ted on, &s;eemed to &s;hew the nece&s;&s;ity of this caution.</P>
<P>The checks on the treaty making power might con&s;i&s;t of &s;everal parts; he &s;hould rely upon two. The fir&s;t was, the nece&s;&s;ity for the concurrence of that Hou&s;e to give the efficacy to a treaty whenever it embraces any object which is contained in the power given by the con&s;titution to Congre&s;s. The Pre&s;ident and Senate, it is acknowledged, have power to make treaties; but who have the power to regulate commerce? Congre&s;s. Who have the power to declare war? Congre&s;s. Who have the power to rai&s;e armies? Congre&s;s. Gentlemen talked much about the will of the people. If he <HI>adored any thing on earth, he &s;aid, it was the will of the people.</HI> The que&s;tion was, what was the will of the people? That will was expre&s;&s;ed in the con&s;titution. And that Hou&s;e, being the direct repre&s;en|tatives of the people, might be rea&s;onably &s;uppo&s;ed to be the repre&s;entatives of the public will; and it was nece&s;&s;ary, therefore, that they &s;hould concur in a mea&s;ure of &s;o great importance as that of a commerical treaty. But gentle|men &s;eem to &s;peak of that Hou&s;e as mere cyphers. What was the oath they took on taking their &s;eats? Not to &s;it &s;ilent to &s;ee the rights of the people invaded; but to guard the con&s;titution. Shall they them &s;hrink from their duty; be tru&s;ted they would not.</P>
<P>The other check to the treaty making power, was that of the right of appropriation placed in Congre&s;s. <Q>No
<PB N="85" REF="030221_0017_0FE527A0713171E0">
money &s;hall be drawn from the trea&s;ury but in con&s;e|quence of appropriations made by law.</Q> Whence came this caution? From the &s;ame &s;pirit which dictated the other checks in the con&s;titution. Without an appropria|tion no mi&s;chief can be effected. He would a&s;k the meaning of the word law? Law, &s;aid he, is a rule of conduct pre&s;cribed by competent authority, Does the law mentioned in this clau&s;e refer to the treaty making power? No. What does it mean? It refers to Congre&s;s and not to the treaty making power, then the law nece&s;&s;ary to make appropriation is the exerci&s;e of the whole of the authority appointed by the people to make laws. But gentlemen finding that a new di&s;tinction mu&s;t be made with re&s;pect to di&s;crimination, have undertaken a new definition. The gentleman from Connecticut, &s;peaking on this &s;ub|ject, a&s;ked whether all di&s;tinction was to be di&s;claimed? No, he &s;aid they were to exerci&s;e &s;ound di&s;cretion; but he was at a lo&s;s to know what di&s;cretion was left them, if they might not refu&s;e to appropriate money to carry in|to effect what appeared to them mi&s;chievous. The gen|tleman from South Carolina attempted to define this &s;ort of di&s;cretion, and fini&s;hed his remarks by &s;aying, that they could never have a right to do wrong. But this did not define their idea. He would undertake to define the di&s;cretion they &s;et up, it was a prede&s;tinated di&s;cretion, not giving its votaries a power of choice, but impelling them by nece&s;&s;ity. Indeed the whole force of the remarks of gentlemen, was to recommend an ea&s;y, docile kind of di&s;cretion, which would be influenced by the opinions of others. Some gentlemen finding this doctrine would not do, have taken what they call moral obligation as their ground. He hoped they would give up con&s;titutional ob|ligation, becau&s;e he believed a con&s;titutional obligation was a moral one al&s;o.</P>
<P>There had been much difficulty, he &s;aid, with re&s;pect to moral obligation. The exerci&s;e of moral &s;en&s;e was put in the di&s;crimination of the Pre&s;ident and Senate, in their having made a treaty which gentlemen &s;ay binds that Hou&s;e to carry it into effect. He always under&s;tood that moral &s;en&s;e mu&s;t re&s;ide in an agent. There was a re|markable in&s;tance of it in Great Britain, and more re|markable, becau&s;e their King can do no wrong. This
<PB N="86" REF="030221_0018_0FE52879E3F04970">
brought him again to the word law. It was &s;aid they intended to repeal the treaty. No. They claimed a power to refu&s;e the pa&s;&s;ing of a law&mdash;a mere negative power. When he was called upon to pa&s;s a law, was he to do it without con&s;ideration? Legi&s;lation nece&s;&s;ari|ly includes deliberation. It was the meaning of it. How then can a Legi&s;lature be addre&s;&s;ed in this language, <Q>al|though we acknowledge you are a legi&s;lative body, yet, in this ca&s;e, you have no right to di&s;cu&s;s the me|rits of the treaty which you are to appropriate money to carry into effect,</Q> The gentleman from Connecticut, who was entitled to much prai&s;e for his ability and ingenuity, &s;aid he could exerci&s;e his opinion as a citizen upon the treaty, but not as a legi&s;lator. He could not enter into this di&s;tinction; for every opinion which he formed as a citizen, he held as a legi&s;lator. Gentlemen &s;hould con&s;ider that in pa&s;&s;ing a law, they were on legi&s;lative and not on executive ground. It ap|peared to him that the&s;e opinions had been fo&s;tered by gentlemen who were in the habit of a&s;&s;ociating together, and con&s;idered to have more force than they will be found to po&s;&s;e&s;s. He had been told that pulpit orators were le&s;s able to &s;upport an argument than other men, from their dictatorial habits; and he believed the gentlemen who &s;upported the arguments in favour of prerogative, though they appeared &s;mooth and fea&s;ible, would find a difficul|ty in &s;upporting them.</P>
<P>They had been told it was unfair to make allu&s;ions to the Briti&s;h Hou&s;e of Commons.&mdash;The reference had been made for two purpo&s;es, viz, to &s;hew the practicability and the u&s;e of the check in&s;i&s;ted upon, as it is fully ac|knowledged in that government. When prerogative was the que&s;tion, tho&s;e gentlemen who now oppo&s;e the appeal, are them&s;elves the fir&s;t to make it; and he did not ex|pect that in the year 1796, the Briti&s;h Hou&s;e of Commons would have been acknowledged to po&s;&s;e&s;s greater privile|ges than the Legi&s;lature of the United States; but this was the fact, that they were &s;truggling for popular rights, and obliged to refer to Britain to &s;trengthen their claim. He acknowledged that the Briti&s;h Con&s;titution was made up of cu&s;toms, but the&s;e were their Con&s;titution equally with their written one. The clau&s;e of their Con&s;titution which
<PB N="87" REF="030221_0019_0FE528492ECCAEB0">
forbids the drawing of money from the Trea&s;ury but by law, is copied from the Engli&s;h practice; but now an at|tempt was made to wre&s;t this privilege from their hands. If checks are nece&s;&s;ary, &s;aid Mr. Giles, no danger can ari&s;e from multiplying them, but were the contrary doc|trine to prevail, it would lead to this, that the Pre&s;ident and Senate might reduce that Hou&s;e from the real and efficient, to mere formal guardians of the people.</P>
<P>It was &s;aid, that when a treaty is made by the Pre&s;i|dent, with the approbation of two thirds of the Senate, it is the &s;upreme law of the land, and they were bound to obey it. It &s;hould be recollected, that about three years ago, Congre&s;s was occupied in di&s;cu&s;&s;ing the nece&s;&s;ary mea&s;ures to be pur&s;ued with re&s;pect to Great Britain. The Hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives differed in opinion from the other branches. They deemed it advi&s;able not to tru&s;t &s;olely on the magnanimity of the king, nor to any of his other qualities; &s;everal regulations were propo&s;ed. What was done? Certain mea&s;ures were agreed upon in that Hou&s;e, &s;ent to the Senate, but there negatived by the pre&s;iding voice only. A negociator was then appointed, and the con&s;equence has been found to be a treaty, which goes to an inhibition of the powers of that Hou&s;e, which gives a power to legi&s;late again&s;t legi&s;lation. He would not &s;ay what evil con&s;equences might ari&s;e from &s;uch an in|&s;trument. He only remarked upon the evil of a treaty making power, which would oblige that Hou&s;e to grant money to carry into effect mea&s;ures which might be &s;ub|ver&s;ive of the public intere&s;t.</P>
<P>The difference of opinion which he had mentioned, was not the only in&s;tance in which the Senate and that Hou&s;e di&s;agreed in &s;entiment. He believed the Senate pa&s;&s;ed two or three bills to increa&s;e the military e&s;tabli&s;h|ment which were negatived by them. The doctrine of checks was fully illu&s;trated. If, the Pre&s;ident and Se|nate can, by the a&s;&s;ociation of a foreign power, legi&s;late and bind their mea&s;ures conclu&s;ively on that Hou&s;e, may they not go on to any extent? what &s;ecurity have the peo|ple again&s;t &s;uch a power? the treaty in que&s;tion is yet open for farther negociation. Suppo&s;e Great Britain on
<PB N="88" REF="030221_0020_0FE529B88B7CFE88">
pretence of guarding her frontier, were to &s;end 10,000 troops into Canada; and &s;uppo&s;e the United States were to rai&s;e 10,000 men to keep the Indians in order. Sup|po&s;e the thing was pre&s;ented to that Hou&s;e, not for de|liberation, but obedience, what could be done? how would this operate with re&s;pect to appropriation? the li|mitation might be for ten or twenty years, they could not withhold appropriations, becau&s;e, it is &s;aid, they are under a moral obligation to do it. Ought they not, then, to be cautious how they admitted the extravagant doctrine laid down? he a&s;ked what were the feelings of the people in general, on account of the injuries received from a fo|reign nation? did they wi&s;h to rely upon the magnanimi|ty of the Briti&s;h monarch? No; they wi&s;hed a redre&s;s of grievances, not a &s;urrender of rights or a conce&s;&s;ion of intere&s;ts.</P>
<P>The doctrine e&s;pou&s;ed by gentlemen in oppo&s;ition to this motion, would cut up all checks, all power of thinking in the legi&s;lative body on occa&s;ions where treaties inter|fered. This was not all. Two of the&s;e gentlemen had a&s;&s;erted, that if that Hou&s;e went into a di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the treaty, it would be rebellion again&s;t the other authorities. What, &s;aid he, can ju&s;tify &s;uch language? might it not be replied that they were de&s;troying the liberties of their con&s;tituents, and &s;o the debate end in abu&s;e? gentlemen can have little re&s;pect for the opinions of tho&s;e who dif|fer from them in &s;entiment, who give way to &s;uch ex|pre&s;&s;ions. Another argument which had been a common place one, was, that the effect of any hindrance to carrying into effect this treaty, would be the di&s;organizing of the government. He &s;uppo&s;ed that the propo&s;ition before the Hou&s;e, with the negative vote in&s;i&s;ted on, as the right of that a&s;&s;embly, was a &s;ort of acqua&s;ortis which was to eat up the whole powers of government. Suppo&s;e, &s;aid he, there &s;hould be a vote that the treaty &s;hould not be carried into effect, would not that Hou&s;e go on with its bu&s;ine&s;s as u&s;ual? &s;urely it would. There was not the lea&s;t foundation for &s;uch a&s;&s;ertions. They were mere clamour; a voice, and nothing be&s;ides. Whenever the different branches of government, in&s;tead of checking each other, coalefeed together, and confidence in the Ex|ecutive is the only &s;ecurity for good government, the
<PB N="89" REF="030221_0021_0FE528C01D79F5A0">
&s;y&s;tem will be reduced indeed. But even then, the Ame|rican people would not be intimidated by any military e&s;tabli&s;hment; for, finding the inefficacy of proper checks in their government, they would unitedly re&s;i&s;t any at|tempt to deprive them of their liberties.</P>
<P>It was &s;aid that certain advantages were to be derived to the United States from the late treaty, but he knew not of what &s;ort. And, he exclaimed, is the government of the United States brought to &s;o low an ebb, as to be indebted to foreign nations for aid? if it was, he &s;up|po&s;ed by and by new conce&s;&s;ions would be made, for further &s;ervices. But if it be once under&s;tood, that there is not &s;ufficient merits in the government to &s;ecure the affections of the people, but that the Pre&s;ident and Se|nate mu&s;t lean on Great Britain for &s;upport, to what a lamentable &s;ituation will the United States be reduced! he believed that if the doctrine attempted to be &s;upported were to prevail, and by that means to de&s;troy the pro|vi&s;ion of checks, the de&s;poti&s;m of a Pre&s;ident and twen|ty Senators (he did not mean the pre&s;ent Pre&s;ident and Senators) might operate to an a&s;&s;ociation of De&s;poti&s;m, which, if ever effected, mu&s;t be by coercive mea&s;ures.</P>
<P>Mr. Giles &s;aid he might be mi&s;taken, but there was certainly an attempt to e&s;tabli&s;h principles leading to that end. He &s;poke of calumnies which had been &s;pread abroad again&s;t him, but which he di&s;dained to an&s;wer. He left his conduct to &s;peak for him. If the public were to be led a&s;tray by declamations about war, di&s;organization and confu&s;ion, very little reliance could be placed on them. He concluded, by &s;aying, that he hoped the importance of the &s;ubject, and his earne&s;t wi&s;h to retain the whole&s;ome provi&s;ions again&s;t the po&s;&s;ibility of incroachments upon the liberties of the people, would be a &s;ufficient apology for having &s;o long engaged the attention of the com|mittee.</P>
<P>The ta&s;k of an&s;wering this artful &s;peech fell to Mr. Sedgwick. How he acquitted him&s;elf the reader will &s;ee.</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="030221_0022_0FE5292518B2F3C8">Mr. SEDGWICK (Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts) &s;aid that after the length of time which had been con&s;umed, and the talents which had been &s;o ably exerted, in the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of this &s;ub|ject, he &s;hould not think him&s;elf authori&s;ed to call the attention of the committee, to any ob&s;ervations of his, but that he con&s;idered it in principle, and in its con&s;e|quences, as the mo&s;t important que&s;tion, which had ever been debated in this Hou&s;e. It was no le&s;s, than whe|ther this Hou&s;e &s;hould, by con&s;truction and implication, extend its controuling influence to &s;ubjects which were expre&s;sly, and he thought exclu&s;ively, delegated by the people to another department of the Government. We had heretofore been warned emphatically again&s;t &s;eizing on power, by con&s;truction and implication. He had known no in&s;tance, in which the caution which that warning en|forced, de&s;erved more attention than on the pre&s;ent occa|&s;ion.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t, he &s;aid, have been fore&s;een by the author of the motion, that it would ultimately be conte&s;ted on the pre&s;ent ground. No &s;ufficient rea&s;on had been given as an object for the call. The various rea&s;ons which had been hinted at, had hardly been &s;ugge&s;ted, before they were re&s;pectively abandoned. It would be remembered, and indeed had been avowed, that a reque&s;t &s;uch as the pre&s;ent, was in nature of a demand. That, it was true, if we had an authority on the &s;ubject of forming treaties, we had a right to all the means of exerci&s;ing an intelli|gent di&s;cretion; and the demand, of cour&s;e, was well founded. But if we had no &s;uch authority, and we had none unle&s;s it could be di&s;covered in the Con&s;titution, then the demand had no good foundation on which it could re&s;t, and was in his opinion, an attempt at &s;eizing on power by u&s;urpation.</P>
<P>He was perfectly &s;en&s;ible in how di&s;agreeable an atti|tude a man would &s;tand, who &s;hould attempt to limit the extent of power, claimed by an a&s;&s;embly to which he &s;hould addre&s;s him&s;elf. He had &s;ome of the mo&s;t power|ful inclinations of human nature to contend with. He felt the full force of the influence of this principle, as it would afford the cau&s;e of repul&s;ion and re&s;i&s;tance, to the arguments which he might &s;ubmit. But having for|med
<PB N="91" REF="030221_0023_0FE528C335E1B380">
an opinion, perfectly &s;atisfactory to his own mind, from the be&s;t light which hone&s;t inve&s;tigation could pro|cure, he thought it a duty he owed his country and po&s;|terity, a duty rendered more indi&s;pen&s;able, from the ob|ligations which were upon him to obey the will of the people, expre&s;&s;ed in the Con&s;titution of their government, which he had &s;worn to &s;upport, &s;olemnly to declare that opinion and the rea&s;ons on which it was founded.</P>
<P>He in his con&s;cience believed, that if the Con&s;titution could operate the benefits its original in&s;titution intended, that if the government &s;hould be rendered adequate to the protection of liberty and the &s;ecurity of the people: it mu&s;t be, by keeping its &s;evaral departments di&s;tinct, and within their pre&s;cribed limits. Hence that man would give as good evidence of republicani&s;m, of virtue, of &s;in|cere love of country, who &s;hould defend the executive in the exerci&s;e of his con&s;titutional rights, as the man who &s;hould contend for any other department of govern|ment. If either &s;hould u&s;urp the appropriate powers of another, anarchy, confu&s;ion or de&s;poti&s;m mu&s;t en&s;ue. The functions of the u&s;urping power would not be legiti|mate but their exerci&s;e, de&s;poti&s;m. If the power of con|trouling treaties was not in the Hou&s;e, the &s;ame &s;pirit which might u&s;urp it, might al&s;o declare the exi&s;tence of the Hou&s;e perpetual and fill the vacancies as they &s;hould occur. The merits of the pre&s;ent que&s;tion it &s;eem|ed to be agreed, depended on this right; it was of infi|nite importance therefore to decide it ju&s;tly.</P>
<P>It would be taken for granted that it would be con|ceded, on all hands, that we were to re&s;ort to the Con|&s;titution, to know the extent and limits of our power, and that if we found not there a clear evidence of its exi&s;tence, we ought to abandon the exerci&s;e. It was certain we had not any expre&s;s delegation to make or to controul the public will in any of our relations with fo|reign nations. On the other hand we found it declared, that the Pre&s;ident &s;hould <HI>have power to make treaties, by and with the advice and con&s;ent of the Senate, provided two thirds of the Senators pre&s;ent concurred.</HI> Treaties to attain the ends for which they were de&s;igned were from their nature &s;upreme laws: but the Con&s;titution had in ano|ther

place declared, that treaties made under the authori|ty of the United States &s;hould be &s;upreme laws. Gen|tlemen had &s;aid that it was not declared that treaties made by the <HI>Pre&s;ident and Senate</HI> &s;hould have this effect; but tho&s;e made under the <HI>authority of the United States.</HI> The que&s;tion then recurred what treaties were made under the <HI>authority of the United States.</HI> The true an&s;wer un|doubtedly was, treaties made by tho&s;e, to whom the peo|ple, by their Con&s;titution, had delegated the power. The Pre&s;ident, qualified as had been mentioned, had ex|pre&s;sly and none el&s;e had &s;uch power. If we were to re&s;t the &s;ubject here, it would &s;eem to follow irre&s;i&s;ta|bly, and to be incapable almo&s;t of higher proof, that whenever a compact was formed by the Pre&s;ident, with a foreign nation, and had received the advice and con|&s;ent of the Senate, if it was of &s;uch a nature as to be properly denominated a treaty, all its &s;tipulations would thereby and from that moment become "&s;upreme laws."</P>
<P>That &s;uch had been the con&s;truction from the com|mencement of the government to the promulgation of the Briti&s;h treaty, he believed, would be univer&s;ally ad|mitted; and but for that treaty, probably, never would have been denied. Did this afford no evidence, that the con&s;truction was a ju&s;t one. Was the &s;ubject a le&s;s im|portant one, its deci&s;ion might be &s;afely tru&s;ted on this ground. But all important as it was for the purpo&s;e of further inve&s;tigation, it might be u&s;eful to con&s;ider the nature, extent, objects and effects of this power.</P>
<P>What authority was then delegated under a grant of power to form treaties; did not the term <HI>Treaty</HI> include all &s;tipulations between independent nations, relative to &s;ubjects, in which the contracting parties, had a mutual or common intere&s;t? if it had a more confined or limited &s;en&s;e it became tho&s;e who contended for it, to make the limits and de&s;ignate the boundaries. Without a power &s;o exten&s;ive, much of the benefits re&s;ulting from amicable intercour&s;e, between independent nations, would be lo&s;t; and di&s;putes and differences, which are inevitable, would have no means of amicable termination. From the ob|vious utility and indeed the ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity, that &s;uch power &s;hould be exerci&s;ed, we know of no civilized na|tion,

either ancient or modern, which had not provided the organs of negociation, to the extent &s;ub&s;tantially which he had mentioned. The power indi&s;pen&s;ible had always been delegated, though guards had been provided again&s;t its abu&s;e by different means:</P>
<P>It was not now to be enquired, whether the power of treating was wi&s;ely depo&s;ited, (although he was inclined to believe it could not be intru&s;ted to &s;afer hands.) It was &s;ufficient that tho&s;e who had the right, the citizens of America, had declared their will, which we were bound to re&s;pect, becau&s;e we had &s;worn to &s;upport it, and becau&s;e we were their deputies.</P>
<P>The power of treating between independent nations might be cla&s;&s;ed under the following heads. 1. To com|po&s;e and adju&s;t differences whether to terminate or to prevent war. 2. To form contracts for mutual &s;ecurity or defence; or to make treaties offen&s;ive or defen&s;ive. 3. To regulate an intercour&s;e for mutual benefit, or to form treaties of commerce. Without the fir&s;t war and con|tention could only be terminated, by the de&s;truction of one of the parties: without the &s;econd there could be no defence, by means of union and concurrence, again&s;t &s;uperior force, and without the la&s;t, a profitable and be|neficial intercou&s;e, could not be arranged on terms of re|ciprocity. Hence, then, it mu&s;t be evident to every un|prejudiced mind, that by a grant of power to make trea|ties, authority was given to bind the nation by &s;tipulations to pre&s;erve peace or terminate war&mdash;to enter into alli|ances offen&s;ive and defen&s;ive, and to form commercial treaties.</P>
<P>This power, he held, unlimited by the con&s;titution, and he held, too, that in its nature, to the extent he had mentioned, it was illimitable. Did a &s;erious difference exi&s;t with a foreign nation, in determining on the nature and extent of the &s;tipulations which might be nece&s;&s;ary to adju&s;t it; the cau&s;e of injury&mdash;national rights and ho|nour&mdash;the evils of war, and all circum&s;tances of relation between the two countries, mu&s;t be taken into account.</P>

A thou&s;and circum&s;tances of foreign relations would occur in the hi&s;tory of every country, under which nothing &s;hort of unlimited powers of negociation would be adequate to a prevention of enormous perhaps ruinous evils.</P>
<P>But it might be objected that a power &s;o enormous, and comprehending &s;uch e&s;&s;ential intere&s;ts might be abu&s;ed, and thence a&s;ked, where is the remedy? to this he an|&s;wered, that a national a&s;&s;ociation required, for the great purpo&s;e of pre&s;ervation, an unlimited confidence on ma|ny &s;ubjects. Hence not only this, but perhaps every other national government, had delegated to it, an unlimit|ed controul over the per&s;ons and property of the nation. It might, by the expre&s;s power given to it of rai&s;ing ar|mies, convert every citizen into a &s;oldier, and by a &s;ingle a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment of a tax, it might command the u&s;e of all the property in the country.</P>
<P>The power to rai&s;e armies and taxes was limited in its exerci&s;e by nothing but the di&s;cretion of the Legi&s;lature, under the direction of its prudence, wi&s;dom and virtue. Was there no &s;ecurity again&s;t a wanton abu&s;e of the&s;e enor|mous powers? yes; it was to be hoped that the people in electing the members of this Hou&s;e, and the &s;tates in chu&s;ing tho&s;e of the other, would not &s;elect characters, who regardle&s;s of the public good would wantonly impo&s;e on their con&s;tituents unnece&s;&s;ary burthens. It would be an additional &s;ecurity that the intere&s;ts of the rulers, were in&s;eparably connected, with tho&s;e of the people&mdash; that they could impo&s;e no burthens in which them&s;elves did not equally participate. But &s;hould all tho&s;e guards be in&s;ufficient, was there no dependence to be placed in the Pre&s;ident? the man elected by a refined proce&s;s, pre-emi|nent in fame and virtue as in rank? was there no &s;ecu|rity in the watchful guardian&s;hip of &s;uch a character re|&s;pon&s;ible by every thing dear and valuable to man&mdash;his reputation, his own and his fellow citizens happi|ne&s;s?

was there no well founded reliance on all the&s;e con&s;iderations, for &s;ecurity again&s;t oppre&s;&s;ion? if not, we had not the requi&s;ite materials, with which to admini&s;ter a republican government, and the project might be aban|doned.&mdash;After all however, &s;hould the unlimited powers he had mentioned, and &s;uch powers mu&s;t always be unli|mited, be wantonly abu&s;ed, was there no remedy? yes, in the good &s;en&s;e and manly independent &s;pirit of the peo|ple. If intolerable burthens were wantonly impo&s;ed, if nece&s;&s;ary to defeat the oppre&s;&s;ion, oppo&s;ition and in&s;urrection would not only be authorized, but become a duty. And if any man could hone&s;tly lay his hand on his heart, and in &s;incerity declare, that a compliance with an exi&s;ting treaty, was worth more than our government, our con&s;titution, our union and the liberty protected by them; to that man he was ready to declare, that oppo&s;ition had become a duty. Gentlemen had &s;poken of the &s;ubject, as if the members of this Hou&s;e were the only repre&s;entatives of the people, as their only protectors again&s;t the u&s;urpations and oppre&s;&s;ions of the other departments of government. Who then he a&s;ked were the Senators? were they unfeel|ing tyrants, who&s;e intere&s;ts were &s;eparated from and op|po&s;ed to tho&s;e of the people? No. Did they po&s;&s;e&s;s hereditary power and honours? No. Who, as contem|plated by the con&s;titution, were they? the mo&s;t enlight|ened and the mo&s;t virtuous of our citizens. What was the &s;ource from whence they derive their elevation? from the confidence of the people, and the free choice of their electors. Who were tho&s;e electors? not an ignorant herd, who could be cajoled, flattered and deceived, not even the body of the enlightened American citizens: but their legi&s;latures&mdash;men to whom the real characters of the candidates would be known. For what purpo&s;es were they elected? to repre&s;ent the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential intere&s;ts of their country&mdash;As the guardians of the &s;overeignty of the &s;tates, the happine&s;s of the people and their liber|ties&mdash;Who as contemplated by the con&s;titution was the Pre&s;ident? the man elected, by means intended to ex|clude the operation of faction and ambition, as the one be&s;t entitled to public confidence and e&s;teem&mdash;And was no confidence to be repo&s;ed in &s;uch characters, thus elect|ed? might it not, to &s;ay no more, be at lea&s;t doubtful whe|ther

the treating power might not be as &s;afely intru&s;ted in &s;uch hands exclu&s;ively, as with the participation and un|der the controul of the more numerous branch of the le|gi&s;lature, elected in &s;mall di&s;tricts, a&s;&s;ailed by party and faction, and expo&s;ed to influence and intrigue? whatever merits this as an original que&s;tion might po&s;&s;e&s;s, the people had decided their will. To the Pre&s;ident and Se|nate they have given powers to make treaties, they have given no &s;uch powers to this Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>It was not in his opinion, proper when inve&s;tigating the con&s;titutional que&s;tion of the extent of a particular power and in what hands it was depo&s;ited, to divert the attention to a po&s;&s;ible abu&s;e of that power. Should it become a que&s;tion whether Congre&s;s was by the con&s;ti|tution authori&s;ed to rai&s;e armies, and the extent to which the power might be exerci&s;ed, it would be unfair and improper to divert the attention from the enquiry of what was the truth, to the abu&s;e which might re&s;ult from the exerci&s;e of the power&mdash;To &s;tate that if &s;uch power exi&s;ted, every citizen might by the wanton abu&s;e of it, be degraded from his rank and &s;ubjected to the de&s;poti&s;m of a military di&s;cipline. To &s;hew that armies might be em|ployed as the in&s;truments of de&s;troying liberty&mdash;To picture your country as &s;trewed with human carca&s;&s;es and &s;tained with human blood by their means. What would this be but to &s;ub&s;tantiate prejudices in&s;tead of arguments? &s;till however it would remain true, that the power of Con|gre&s;s to rai&s;e armies, was only limited, by its di&s;cretion, under the direction of wi&s;dom and patrioti&s;m. The &s;ame ob&s;ervations changing their relations, may with equal ju&s;tne&s;s be applied to the treaty making power. To be, and continue a nation, required on the&s;e &s;ubjects unlimit|ed confidence in the delegation of the nece&s;&s;ary powers. The people had granted them and provided, again&s;t their abu&s;e, &s;uch guard as their wi&s;dom dictated.</P>
<P>The gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Madi&s;on) had &s;tated five different con&s;tructions which po&s;&s;ibly might be given to the con&s;titution on this &s;ubject. Three of which (and for none of them to Mr. Sedgwick's knowledge had any man ever contended) the gentleman had proved to be un&s;ound|ed. The fourth, that which we had given to the con&s;ti|tution,
<PB N="97" REF="030221_0029_0FE529CA10A5BFD0">
if admitted, and it &s;hould be abu&s;ed might pro|duce mi&s;chievous effects. Was not this true of all the great and e&s;&s;ential powers of government? if the con|trouling influence of the Hou&s;e was added would the pow|er be le&s;s? and if under the&s;e circum&s;tances, abu&s;ed would the injury be more tolerable? in &s;hort was not this a kind of argument infinitely more tending to the pro|duction of prejudice than to the di&s;covery of truth?</P>
<P>The gentleman had really given no deci&s;ive opinion what was the true con&s;truction. He had however &s;eemed to incline to a belief, that to the &s;tipulation of a treaty relative to any &s;ubject committed to the controul of the Legi&s;lature, to give it validity, legi&s;lative co-operation was nece&s;&s;ary. Of con&s;equence if this was withheld, the operation of the treaty would be defeated. That it was at the will and within the di&s;cretion of the Legi&s;la|ture to withhold &s;uch co-operation, and of cour&s;e the Hou&s;e might controul and defeat the &s;olemn engagements of the Pre&s;ident and Senate.</P>
<P>The gentleman who had &s;ugge&s;ted this opinion was well known to the committee and through America. Mr. Sedgwick could not but ob&s;erve, that it was per|fectly unaccountable to his mind, that that gentleman had yet to form an opinion to whom was delegated that power, the nature, extent and effects of which he had &s;o &s;trongly and per&s;picuou&s;ly detailed. The capacity of that gentleman's mind, long exerci&s;ed on political &s;ub|jects, his known caution and prudence, would authorize a reque&s;t, that he or his friends would explain, how it was po&s;&s;ible, if &s;uch as he &s;tates &s;hould have been the intention of tho&s;e who framed the Con&s;titution, that the true meaning &s;hould not have been expre&s;&s;ed in the in|&s;truments? that when the gentleman went from the A&s;|&s;embly which framed the Con&s;titution, immediately after|wards to one of tho&s;e which ratified it; he &s;hould have admit|ted an oppo&s;ite con&s;truction. As Mr. Sedgwick would under|take by and by to prove that in the Convention of Virginia he did admit the very con&s;truction for which we now contended. He would take the liberty further to enquire, how it happen|ed that if &s;uch was really the intention of the in&s;trument, that &s;uch was the meaning of the people, no man had
<PB N="98" REF="030221_0030_0FE529CCD0C47718">
heard of it, until the di&s;covery was produced, by the Briti&s;h treaty? &s;trange national intention unknown for years, to every individual!&mdash;As the gentleman had been plea&s;ed to dwell on the idea of a co-operation between the powers of the government, he would take the liber|ty to &s;tate what had been ably explained by other gentle|men, that the power of making treaties was wholly dif|ferent from that of making ordinary laws, originating from different motives, producing different effects and operating to a different extent. In all tho&s;e particulars the difference had been perfectly under&s;tood. For in|&s;tance the ordinary legal protection of property and the puni&s;hment of its violation could never be extended be|yond your own juri&s;diction, but by treaty, the &s;ame pro|tection could be extended within the juri&s;diction of a foreign government. You could not legi&s;late an adju&s;t|ment of di&s;putes, nor a peace with another country, but by treaty both might be effected. Your laws in no in|&s;tance could operate except in your own juri&s;diction, and on your own citizens; by treaty an operation was given to &s;tipulations, within the juri&s;diction of both the contract|ing parties.</P>
<P>It had been &s;aid that treaties would not operate on tho&s;e &s;ubjects which were con&s;igned to legi&s;lative con|troul. "If this be true," &s;aid he, <Q>how impotent in this re&s;pect is the power of the government? what, then permit me to enquire can the power of treating effect? I will tell you what it cannot do&mdash;it can make no alliances, becau&s;e any &s;tipulations for offen&s;ive or defen&s;ive operations will infringe on the legi&s;lative pow|er of declaring war, laying taxes or rai&s;ing armies or all of them. No treaty of peace can probably be made which will not either a&s;certain boundaries, &s;tipulate privileges to aliens, the payment of money or a ce&s;&s;ion of territory, and certainly no treaty of commerce can be made.</Q></P>
<P>Was it not &s;trange that to this late hour it &s;hould have been delayed, and that now all at once it &s;hould have been di&s;covered, that no power was delegated to any bo|dy to regulate our foreign relations? that although a power was granted to the Pre&s;ident and Senate to form
<PB N="99" REF="030221_0031_0FE528C63B7E5CA8">
treaties, that yet there were &s;uch re&s;ervations and re&s;trict|ions, that there remained nothing on which this power could operate? or was it true that this power, was com|petent to treat with every government on earth but that of Great Britain? might he not be permitted further to enquire if this treaty had been formed with any other power, with the preci&s;e &s;tipulations it now contained, whether there ever could have exi&s;ted this doubt of con|&s;titutionality?</P>
<P>We had, he &s;aid, entered into treaties of commerce with many nations, we had formed an alliance and en|tered into a guarantee with France, we had gived con&s;ul|ar power including judicial authority to the citizens of that country, within our own juri&s;diction, we had defin|ed piracies and provided for their puni&s;hment, we have removed the di&s;abilities of alienage, we had granted &s;ub|&s;idies and ceded territory: all this and much more we had done, while the power of the government remained unque&s;tioned and none even thought that &s;uch treaties re|quired legi&s;lative co-operation. Treaties &s;uch as tho&s;e could without oppo&s;ition and by unanimous con&s;ent be ratified and con&s;idered by force of &s;uch ratification as &s;u|preme laws; but &s;imilar &s;tipulations with Great Britain, were clearly perceived to be uncon&s;titutional, and Pre&s;i|dent, Envoy and Senate were denounced for their re|&s;pective agency as infractors of the con&s;titution.</P>
<P>The objection which he had ju&s;t an&s;wered had been brought forward by a gentleman from Penn&s;ylvania [Mr. Gallatin] with another nearly allied to it, if not re&s;ting on preci&s;ely the &s;ame foundation&mdash;that whatever &s;tipula|tion in a treaty required legi&s;lative provi&s;ion or repealed a law, did not become a &s;upreme law, until it had received le|gi&s;lative &s;anction. There was no limitation expre&s;&s;ed in the con&s;titution on which to found either of tho&s;e objections. If we claimed the power which the objections imported the claim mu&s;t re&s;t on con&s;truction and implication alone. In|deed the whole rea&s;oning of the gentlemen &s;eemed to him to be capable of being expre&s;&s;ed in a few words. <Q>The Pre&s;ident and Senate, in the &s;ole and uncontrouled exerci&s;e of the treaty making power, may &s;acrifice the mo&s;t important intere&s;ts of the people. The Hou&s;e

of Repre&s;entative is more worthy the public confi|dence, and therefore by our influence we will pre|vent the abu&s;e of power.</Q></P>
<P>The gentleman, to prove his po&s;ition &s;tated that the power of treating in Great Britain and the United States is preci&s;ely the &s;ame. He then had read a pa&s;&s;age from Judge Black&s;tone <Q>that the &s;overeign power of treat|ing with foreign nations was ve&s;ted in the per&s;on of the king, and that any contract he engaged in, no power in the kingdom could delay, re&s;i&s;t or annul.</Q> At the &s;ame time he &s;aid that certain treaties, &s;uch as tho&s;e of &s;ub&s;idy and commerce were not binding until ratified by parliament. Now both the&s;e could not be true; for it was no le&s;s than a direct contradiction in terms to &s;ay, that there was no power in the nation which could de|lay, re&s;i&s;t or annul the contracts of the king, and at the &s;ame time to &s;ay, there was a power in the nation. The parliament, which could delay, re&s;i&s;t and annul tho&s;e contracts. Both the a&s;&s;ertions could not be true. He was willing however to allow that the treaties which the gentlemen had mentioned were not the &s;upreme laws of that country until approved by the legi&s;lature. He had already &s;aid that different countries had provided different guards, again&s;t the abu&s;e of this power. But why attempt to divert our attention from a con&s;truction of our own con&s;titution, to the vague uncertain cu&s;toms and practices of other countries? why compare the Pre|&s;ident and Senate to the king of Great Britain? in what was there a re&s;emblance? in nothing. Why then perplex the &s;ubject by the introduction of irrelative matter? was there perceived an intere&s;t in a diver&s;ion from the only le|gitimate &s;ource of information the declared will of the peo|ple? if we found not there the power we claimed, we could exerci&s;e it only by u&s;urpation.</P>
<P>Why did not gentlemen extend their rea&s;oning further? where in point of principle was the difference between re&s;training and controuling the legi&s;lative power? the in|jury may be as great in the one in&s;tance as in the other; nor is there any more foundation for denying to the Pre|&s;ident and Senate the power in the one ca&s;e than in the other, from any words or expre&s;&s;ions in the con&s;titution.</P>
<P><PB N="101" REF="030221_0033_0FE529D374D350C0">If the gentlemen are right in their con&s;truction, if this was the under&s;tanding of the people at the time they de|liberated on and ratified the con&s;titution, the power of the Pre&s;ident and Senate of making treaties which then created the mo&s;t &s;erious deliberation and alarming ap|prehen&s;ion was the mo&s;t innocent thing in nature. It could bind the e&s;&s;ential intere&s;ts of the nation in nothing. Could any man really believe that the agitation which a di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of this &s;ubject occa&s;ioned, more perhaps than any other in the con&s;titution, could have for its object only the power of the Pre&s;ident and Senate, in which two thirds of the latter mu&s;t concur, to dige&s;t &s;chemes of treaties to be laid before the legi&s;lature for its appro|bation?</P>
<P>The gentleman from New York (Mr. Havens) and the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Giles) had a&s;&s;erted the power of the legi&s;lature to repeal treaties&mdash;whenever the wi&s;dom of Congre&s;s &s;hould concur in opinion, with the&s;e gentlemen we &s;hould then cea&s;e to contend re&s;pecting the con&s;truction of the con&s;titution on this &s;ubject. For whenever our nation &s;hould in defiance of every principle of morality and common hone&s;ty, by u&s;urpation e&s;tabli&s;h its right, to pro&s;trate national honor, by &s;porting with the public faith, no nation would &s;ubmit to be contaminated by a connexion with one which avowed the right of viola|ting its faith by the infraction of &s;olemn treaties.</P>
<P>On all &s;ubjects of this &s;ort the real enquiry was and ought to be, what was the intention of the parties to this in&s;trument. Hence a brief review of &s;ome intere&s;ting oc|currences, which took place at the adoption of the go|vernment would not be impertinent, but might be u&s;eful.</P>
<P>A cotemporaneous expo&s;ition of any in&s;trument, and e&s;pecially by tho&s;e who were agents in its fabrication, had been allowed, and was in fact among the be&s;t guides to finding its true meaning. Gentlemen who had been members of the convention, and unfriendly to the con|&s;titution, with an intention of preventing its adoption, had &s;tated to their con&s;tituents that the power of making treaties as con&s;ided to the Pre&s;ident and Senate was as ex|ten&s;ive as was now contended for. Their intention would
<PB N="102" REF="030221_0034_0FE529639A443670">
have been no other than to alarm the people with the dan|gerous extent and what would be the pernicious exerci&s;e of this power. If this charge was unju&s;t and groundle&s;s, what would have have been the conduct of the friends of that in&s;trument? they would have proved the charge mali|cious and ill founded. They would have &s;hewn that the con|&s;titution was not liable to &s;uch an objection. That it could bear no &s;uch con&s;truction. They would in the language of novel di&s;covery have &s;aid, that every &s;ubject of legi&s;la|tion, was an exception from the power of making treaties; and thus they would have proved to the world, that the &s;ages of our country, had devi&s;ed and offered to their en|lightened countrymen a &s;cheme of government de&s;titute, by an expre&s;s delegation, of the the e&s;&s;ential attribute of adju&s;ting differences with other nations; and of agreeing with them on the terms of amicable intercour&s;e. But they did no &s;uch thing&mdash;they admitted the power, proved the nece&s;&s;ity of it and contended that it would be &s;afe in practice. <Q>Let me here, &s;aid he, appeal to any unpre|judiced man, if he can po&s;&s;ibly believe that the ene|mies of the con&s;titution could have made the charge again&s;t it, and that its friends would have admitted the truth of it, on the hypothe&s;is that it was unfounded and fal&s;e.</Q> They certainly knew what they had &s;o recent|ly intended, and having oppo&s;ite objects in view which ex|cited their &s;tronge&s;t wi&s;hes, it was impo&s;&s;ible they &s;hould agree in impo&s;ing on the people a fal&s;e and unwarranta|ble con&s;truction. So far had he extended his reflections as re&s;ulting from the conduct of tho&s;e who formed the con&s;titution; a conduct from which he flattered him&s;elf there flowed demon&s;tration, that the power of making treaties was as exten&s;ive as that which was now contended for. This being the concurrence of men who could not have united to deceive, with regard to which it was im|po&s;&s;ible they &s;hould be mi&s;taken, formed a guide for their opinion, which could not mi&s;lead, which no degree of &s;tupidity could mi&s;take, nor the mo&s;t ingenious &s;ophi&s;try &s;ucce&s;sfully mi&s;repre&s;ent.</P>
<P>So much he had thought proper to &s;ay as re&s;pected the con&s;truction given to this part of the in&s;trument by tho&s;e who formed, who could not mi&s;take, and who were un|der no temptation to mi&s;repre&s;ent it. It might be nece&s;&s;a|ry

in the next place enquire under what opinion it was adopted? and if we perceived a corre&s;pondence of con&s;truc|tion between tho&s;e who formed and tho&s;e who received and approved; we might then &s;urely derive all rea&s;onable &s;a|tisfation that we had di&s;covered the truth. Here he be|lieved that it might be a&s;&s;erted without any danger of con|tradiction, that in the &s;tate conventions it was on one hand affirmed, that the Pre&s;ident and Senate would, by the con&s;titution have power to form treaties on any &s;ub|ject in which the United States and a foreign nation had a common intere&s;t, and that treaties &s;o formed without any other aid or circum&s;tance whatever, would thereby become the &s;upreme law of the land: and that the exer|ci&s;e of this power was not &s;o guarded as to render, it &s;afe to the public intere&s;ts. On the other hand, it was admit|ted that &s;uch was the extent of the power, and it was at|tempted, at lea&s;t, to be proved, that it was &s;o guarded that danger could not rea&s;onably be apprehended, from its exerci&s;e. It would be too tedious and well might be thought unnece&s;&s;ary to con&s;ult all the materials, which might be within our reach on this &s;ubject: but he dared appeal to the recollection of every gentleman, who was in a &s;ituation to know the facts, for the correctne&s;s of the &s;tatement which he had made, and he would read &s;ome few pa&s;&s;ages, from the debates of the convention of Vir|ginia, which would probably be on this occa&s;ion, for ma|ny rea&s;ons admitted, as the be&s;t authority; and particu|larly becau&s;e the &s;ubject, there was examined by eminent and &s;crupulous inve&s;tigation.</P>
<P>He then read &s;everal pa&s;&s;ages to prove the &s;tatement which he had made, and &s;aid, the con&s;truction he contended for was a&s;&s;ented to by a &s;olemn act of the convention which propo&s;ed an amendment, which he al&s;o read, which would be wholly unnece&s;&s;ary on any other hypothe&s;is; and that by the late conduct of the &s;ame &s;tate, in the amendment propo&s;ed to the con|&s;titution, it was manife&s;t that it &s;till entertained the &s;ame opinion.</P>
<P>Mr. SEDGWICK, in the cour&s;e of his &s;peech, read the following extracts from the third volume of <Q>debates and proceedings of the Convention of Virginia.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="104" REF="030221_0036_0FE529C88EC77E38">Mr. MASON, <Q>thought this a mo&s;t dangerous clau&s;e. By the confederation, nine &s;tates were nece&s;&s;ary to con|cur in a treaty. This &s;ecured ju&s;tice and moderation. His principal fear however, was not that five but &s;even &s;tates, a bare majority, would make treaties, to bind the union.</Q></P>
<P>Mr. NICHOLAS &s;aid, <Q>the approbation of the Pre&s;ident, who had no local views, being elected by no parti|al &s;tate, but the people at large, was an additional &s;e|curity.</Q></P>
<P>Mr. MADISON <Q>thought it a&s;toni&s;hing, that gentlemen &s;hould think a treaty &s;hould be got with &s;urpri&s;e, or that foreign nations &s;hould be &s;olicitous to get a treaty ratified by the &s;enators of a few &s;tates&mdash;that &s;hould the Pre&s;ident &s;ummon only a few &s;tates, he would for &s;o atrocious a thing be impeachable.</Q></P>
<P>Mr. HENRY, <Q>If two thirds of a quorum would be empowered to make a treaty, they might relinqui&s;h and alienate territorial rights, and our mo&s;t valuable com|mercial advantages; in &s;hort, if any thing &s;hould be left, it would be becau&s;e the Pre&s;ident and Senate were plea&s;ed to admit it." The power of making treaties was ill guarded, as it extended farther than it did in any country in the world. "Treaties were to have more force here than in any part of chri&s;tendom.</Q></P>
<P>(How, Mr. Sedgwick a&s;ked, could this be true, if the doctrine now laid down, in &s;upport of the motion, was well founded?)</P>
<P>Mr. MADISON. <Q>Are not treaties the law of the land in England? I will refer you to a book, which is in every man's hand&mdash;Black&s;tone's Commentaries. It will inform you, that treaties made by the king, are to be the &s;upreme laws of the land. If they are to have any efficacy they mu&s;t be the laws of the land. They are &s;o in every country.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="105" REF="030221_0037_0FE528D374EA99B0">Gov. RANDOLPH. <Q>It is &s;aid there is no limitation of treaties. I defy the wi&s;dom of that gentleman to &s;hew how they ought to be limited.</Q></P>
<P>Mr. NICHOLAS. <Q>Have we not &s;een in America that treaties were violated, though they are in all countries con&s;idered as the &s;upreme laws of the land?</Q></P>
<P>Mr. MASON. <Q>It is true, that it is one of the greate&s;t acts of &s;overeignty, and therefore ought to be mo&s;t &s;trongly guarded. The ce&s;&s;ion of &s;uch power without &s;uch checks and guards cannot be ju&s;tified&mdash;yet I ac|knowledge &s;uch a power mu&s;t be &s;omewhere. It is &s;o in all governments. If in the cour&s;e of an un&s;uc|ce&s;sful war, we &s;hould be compelled to give up part of our territories, or undergo &s;ubjugation, if the general government could not make a treaty to give up &s;uch a part, for the pre&s;ervation of the re&s;idue, the govern|ment it&s;elf, and con&s;equently the rights of the people mu&s;t fall. Such a power mu&s;t therefore re&s;t &s;ome|where. For my part, I never heard it denied that &s;uch a power mu&s;t be ve&s;ted in the government. Our com|plaint is that it is not &s;ufficiently guarded, and that it requires much more &s;olemnity and caution, than are delineated in that &s;y&s;tem.</Q></P>
<P>(Strange, Mr. Sedgwick &s;aid, that this gentleman did not di&s;cover, or was not told, that treaties before they &s;hould become laws, mu&s;t receive legi&s;lative &s;anction!)</P>
<P><Q>There are other things which the king of England cannot do, which may be done by the Pre&s;ident and Senate in this ca&s;e. Could the king by his prerogative enable foreign &s;ubjects to purcha&s;e lands, and have an hereditary indefea&s;ible title? will any gentleman &s;ay, that they (the Pre&s;ident and Senate) may not make a treaty, whereby the &s;ubjects of France, England and other powers may buy what lands they plea&s;e in this country? the Pre&s;ident and Senate can make any trea|ty what&s;oever. We wi&s;h not to refu&s;e but to guard this power, as it is done in England. We wi&s;h an explicit declaration in that paper, that the power which can make other treaties cannot without the con&s;ent of the
<PB N="106" REF="030221_0038_0FE529D642AE62D8">
national parliament, the national legi&s;lature, di&s;member the empire. The Senate alone ought not to have this power.</Q></P>
<P>Mr. CORBIN (who was in favour of the con&s;titution) <Q>If there be any found part in the con&s;titution, it is in this clau&s;e. The repre&s;entatives are excluded from in|terpo&s;ing in making treaties, becau&s;e large popular a&s;|&s;emblies are very improper to tran&s;act &s;uch bu&s;ine&s;s, from the impo&s;&s;ibility of their acting with &s;ufficient &s;e|crecy, di&s;patch and deci&s;ion, which can only be found in &s;mall bodies, and are always &s;ubject to factions and party animo&s;ities. It would be dangerous to give this power to the Pre&s;ident alone, as the conce&s;&s;ion of &s;uch a power to one individual, is repugnant to republican principles. It is therefore given to the Pre&s;ident and Senate (who repre&s;ent the &s;tates in their individual capa|cities) conjointly. In this it differs from every govern|ment we know. It &s;teers with admirable dexterity be|tween the two extremes&mdash;neither leaving it to the exe|cutive as in mo&s;t other governments, nor to the legi&s;|lature, which would too much retard &s;uch negociations.</Q></P>
<P>That another member of the convention, Mr. Henry, after contending, that the con&s;titution ought to be amend|ed, &s;o as to guard again&s;t the abu&s;e of the treaty making power, by requiring the con&s;ent of the Hou&s;e, concluded his ob&s;ervations by &s;aying:</P>
<P><Q>That when <HI>their</HI> con&s;ent is nece&s;&s;ary there will be a certainty of attending to the public intere&s;ts.</Q></P>
<P>Mr. MADISON concluded this intere&s;ting debate, not by in&s;i&s;ting on that &s;ecurity, which he had now di&s;covered the con&s;titution to have provided again&s;t the abu&s;e of this power: he &s;tated:</P>
<P><Q>That the power was preci&s;ely in the new con&s;titu|tion as it was in the confederation.</Q></P>
<P>The gentleman &s;tated the checks which the con&s;tituti|on had in fact provided, but it did not then occur to him, that the con&s;ent of this Hou&s;e was among&s;t them.</P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="030221_0039_0FE529D7C72D72B8">Mr. Sedgwick then read the amendment which the convention of Virginia propo&s;ed to the con&s;titution.</P>
<P><Q>That no commercial treaty &s;hall be ratified without the concurrence of two thirds of the whole number of the Se|nate; and no treaty ceding, controuling, re&s;training, or &s;u&s;pending, territorial rights or claims of the United States or any of them, or their or any of their rights or claims to fi&s;hing in the American &s;ea, or navigat|ing the American rivers, &s;hall be made but in ca&s;es of the mo&s;t urgent nece&s;&s;ity; nor &s;hall any &s;uch treaty be ratified without the concurrence of three fourths of the whole number of the members of both Hou&s;es re&s;pectively.</Q></P>
<P>He had &s;tated that the real inquiry was, what opinion was entertained on this &s;ubject by tho&s;e who ratified the con&s;titution? if that opinion would be di&s;covered with hone&s;t minds, it mu&s;t be conclu&s;ive on the pre&s;ent debate. He had &s;hewn what opinion was entertained by Virgi|nia&mdash;what power &s;he meant to delegate and to whom. That this opinion remained from that time until &s;he pro|po&s;ed her late amendments, unaltered, appeared from the amendments them&s;elves. That &s;tate, then, and her repre|&s;entatives here, who had expre&s;&s;ed them&s;elves, differed in opinion. He did not mention Virginia with intention of producing any unplea&s;ant &s;en&s;ations. He was willing to allow that &s;he was great, wi&s;e, intelligent, enlightened, and if gentlemen plea&s;ed, <HI>moral;</HI> her opinion derived additional authority from her re&s;pectability.&mdash;It was not Virginia alone, but he was per&s;uaded every other &s;tate, had given preci&s;ely the &s;ame con&s;truction.&mdash;<HI>That the treaty making power with all its effects and con&s;equences, was &s;olely and exclu&s;ively in the Pre&s;ident and Senate:</HI> And he would dare to challenge gentlemen to produce a &s;olitary in&s;tance of its being adopted under any other idea. Indeed, the agita|tion which was at that time produced, would of all things be the mo&s;t ridiculous, if any of the other con&s;tructi|ons were true. If the power was checked as was now con|tended, it was impo&s;&s;ible danger &s;hould be apprehended from its exerci&s;e&mdash;it could indeed do neither good nor evil.</P>
<P><PB N="108" REF="030221_0040_0FE4FE60906DB040">Here then he &s;aid we had the evidence of tho&s;e who framed and of tho&s;e who received and approved the con|&s;titution. There was another &s;ource of enquiry, which would confirm if it wanted confirmation, that con&s;truc|tion for which he had contended. It was the con&s;truct|ion which had been, practically given, by tho&s;e who had admini&s;tered our government, from the commence|ment of our foreign relations, to the pre&s;ent &s;e&s;&s;ion&mdash;a con&s;truction which had been a&s;&s;umed, admitted or acquie&s;|ed in, by our national and &s;tate governments and by every individual citizen until they received new light, by our having accomodated our cau&s;es of contention with Great Britain and e&s;caped the evils with which we had been threatened from that &s;ource.</P>
<P>The a&s;&s;ociation which preceded any expre&s;s contract between the &s;tates, was &s;uppo&s;ed to imply an authority to form national compacts, impo&s;ing national obligations, and pledging the public faith. Hence our treaty with France, which preceded two years our national a&s;&s;ociati|on, the confederation, had been &s;uppo&s;ed binding on us, and not only obliging us to the faithful performance of our expre&s;s engagements, but as drawing after it undefin|ed, unlimited and perpetual obligations of gratitude. This &s;eemed &s;o far as re&s;pected defined obligations, to be a ra|tional deduction from what is an in&s;eparable attendant on national a&s;&s;ociations, and without which a nation would be de&s;titute, of one of the be&s;t means of &s;ecuring its hap|pine&s;s and even exi&s;tence,</P>
<P>To pur&s;ue, he &s;aid, the hi&s;tory of our country on this &s;ubject, in the order of time, it would not be pretended that under the confederation, the powers of Congre&s;s to form "treaties and aiiiances" were more exten&s;ive than tho&s;e of the Pre&s;ident and Senate under the con&s;titution to form "treaties." The legi&s;lative powers of the nati|on, then re&s;iding with the &s;everal &s;tates, were as ob&s;truc|tive to the operation of treaties (and extended to all the objects which the national and &s;tate legi&s;latures now com|prehended) as the congre&s;&s;ional legi&s;lature can now be. Yet under the confederation treaties of alliance, of peace, of commerce, were made, nor until the pre&s;ent moment has their obligation been denied, though they contained
<PB N="109" REF="030221_0041_0FE528D4F8416DA0">
&s;tipulations, perhaps, on all the &s;ubjects to which the treating power could extend. No legi&s;lative provi&s;ion had been thought nece&s;&s;ary to give them validity; and he dared appeal to every member of the committee, that eve|ry enlightened citizen had admitted their binding obliga|tion as &s;upreme laws&mdash;that the treaty of peace in particu|lar, which controuled the mo&s;t important rights of &s;ove|reignty&mdash;arre&s;ted the hand of ju&s;tice in inflicting puni&s;h|ment for the highe&s;t crime which a citizen could commit, trea&s;on&mdash;and &s;tayed proceedings in ca&s;es of confi&s;cation, for forfeitures which had been incurred had always received this con&s;truction&mdash;He would add that it was well under|&s;tood to be the opinion of that tribunal which the con&s;ti|tution had authori&s;ed to pronounce the law the &s;upreme court; that the treaty, <HI>from its own powers</HI> repealed all antecedent laws, which &s;tood in the way of its execution.</P>
<P>To proceed further on. Since the adoption of the con|&s;titution, the powers now denied, had been con&s;tantly ex|erci&s;ed with all the con&s;equences and effects now contend|ed for and until the pre&s;ent moment unque&s;tioned. Peace had been concluded, &s;ub&s;idies granted, payment of money &s;tipulated, territorial rights di&s;cu&s;&s;ed and decided on. Trea|ties for tho&s;e purpo&s;es had been ratified, not by venal and corrupt majorities, but by <HI>virtuous</HI> unanimity. Hence from the moment we had become a nation, under every form of our implied or expre&s;&s;ed a&s;&s;ociation, the powers now denied had been exerci&s;ed, not only without que&s;ti|on but with unqualified approbation.</P>
<P>There was one more point of light in which this &s;ub|ject ought to be viewed. In the year 1789, it was pro|po&s;ed to di&s;criminate in the impo&s;ition of our duties, be|tween the nations with whom we had, and tho&s;e with whom we had not treaties of commerce. The author of this propo&s;ition renewed the &s;ame in the year 1794. This was virtually acknowledging the validity of the treaties which did exi&s;t, and inviting tho&s;e nations who had not already, to form commerical treaties. Something more than this was done by the motions which &s;ome gentlemen of the minority of the Senate, are &s;aid to have made when this very treaty was in di&s;cu&s;&s;ion. Their motions recom|mended an accomodation by treaty of all &s;ub&s;i&s;ting dif|ferences
<PB N="110" REF="030221_0042_0FE528F62687C500">
between the two countries. It could not e&s;cape remark, that the&s;e &s;everal propo&s;itions and motions were &s;upported by all that de&s;cription of per&s;ons who now op|po&s;e the treaty.</P>
<P>It would not then be deemed impertinent to enquire, it was worthy attention, what was imported and admitted by this conduct and by tho&s;e propo&s;itions? they undoubt|edly implied a conce&s;&s;ion that the &s;ub&s;i&s;ting treaties were of validity; why el&s;e &s;hould they be con&s;idered as a me|ritorious cau&s;e of favourable di&s;criminations? they impli|ed, too, that there exi&s;ted in this country a power to treat on commerical relations, and to adju&s;t &s;ub&s;i&s;ting dif|ferences.</P>
<P>If without legi&s;lative aid (and they had received none) tho&s;e treaties would authori&s;e the legi&s;lature to derange the commerical pur&s;uits of the nation, and enter in legi&s;|lative ho&s;tility with that nation with which we had the mo&s;t exten&s;ive relations; it mu&s;t be from the competen|cy of the treaty making power on the principles which we contended. Strange again he would &s;ay, it mu&s;t ap|pear, that the true con&s;truction of the con&s;titution, on this very important &s;ubject, &s;hould have e&s;caped the pe|netration and &s;egacity, of the author of tho&s;e propo&s;itions, during the time of forming and ratifying the in&s;trument, and his whole active public life from tho&s;e periods, until that of the publication of the Briti&s;h treaty.</P>
<P>If, then, it was true, as he had endeavoured to prove, by that power, given by the con&s;titution, to the Pre&s;i|dent and Senate, to make treaties they had an authority to the extent he &s;uppo&s;ed, with all its con&s;equences and effects. If treaties &s;o formed did in fact become the &s;upreme law, then being compacts they bound the public &s;aith and could not be violated without national di&s;grace and per&s;o|nal di&s;honour. They might require legi&s;lative provi&s;ion, to carry them into effect; but this neither implied nor authorized the exerci&s;e of di&s;cretion, as to refu&s;ed. The con&s;titution he had, frequent occa&s;ions of &s;aying, pre|&s;cribed a government of departments. Each was intended to be furni&s;hed with the means of &s;elf pre&s;ervation and de|fence. For this purpo&s;e it was declared, that the Pre&s;ident
<PB N="111" REF="030221_0043_0FE52904008B0DA8">
would receive, a compen&s;ation to be a&s;certained by law. Laws were to be made by the legi&s;lature, of which this Hou&s;e was one branch. To &s;upport the con&s;titution each depart|ment mu&s;t be enabled to perform the functions a&s;&s;igned to it. To enable the executive to do its duties, the compen&s;ation mu&s;t be provided. It was then nece&s;&s;ary to the &s;upport of the con&s;titution, that the compen&s;ation &s;hould be made. We had &s;worn to &s;upport the con&s;titution. The people by their con&s;titution had &s;olemnly engaged that whoever was the pre&s;ident, &s;hould receive a compen&s;ation. We had been deputed to di&s;charge the duties and engagements which our con&s;tituents had a&s;&s;umed. Under the&s;e cir|cum&s;tances no man of common hone&s;ty could declare that we were at liberty to refu&s;e all provi&s;ion.</P>
<P>The gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Madi&s;on) had attempted to take a di&s;tinction between the duties we had impo&s;ed on us by the con&s;titution and &s;uch as were enjoined by law. He could perceive no &s;uch foundation for a di&s;tinction. After the &s;alary of the Pre&s;ident was a&s;certained by law, it could not be paid without an appropriation; would any one &s;ay he was at liberty to withhold it? No man he pre&s;umed would wi&s;h to ri&s;k his reputation by &s;uch an a&s;&s;ertion. For &s;uch conduct in&s;tead of &s;upporting would tend to &s;ubvert, and would if per&s;i&s;ted in, annihilate the con&s;titution. This was un|doubtedly one of the mo&s;t important of the public con|tracts; the truth was, in fact, that we were bound to perform all the public engagements. The truth was, that our national a&s;&s;ociation was a compact of virtue. To &s;upport the con&s;titution it was nece&s;&s;ary to pre&s;erve pub|lic faith&mdash;to promote the public happine&s;s it was e&s;&s;ential to hold &s;acred and to perform the public engagements. In this were included all engagements whether expre&s;&s;ed in the form of con&s;titution, of laws, or of treaties, in any way, indeed, in which the people had agreed that their will and their duties might be expre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>Mr. SEDGWICK concluded by ob&s;erving that he had in|tended to have pre&s;ented the &s;ubject in &s;everal other im|portant a&s;pects, but he had already tre&s;pa&s;&s;ed on the pa|tience of the committee. He would, as the time of ad|journment
<PB N="112" REF="030221_0044_0FE5296005C68018">
was pa&s;&s;ed, &s;u&s;pend for the pre&s;ent any further ob&s;ervations; and he hoped that all the grounds which he had left unoccupied, could be taken by other gentle|men, &s;o as to &s;upercede the nece&s;&s;ity of troubling the com|mittee with any further ob&s;ervations on this &s;ubject.</P>

<HEAD>REMARKS.</HEAD>
<P>The re&s;olution finally pa&s;&s;ed, fifty five again&s;t thirty &s;even. A committee was accordingly ap|pointed to wait on the Pre&s;ident with the &s;ame; and, on the 31&s;t of March the Hou&s;e received his refu&s;al of the papers. His me&s;&s;age was in his u&s;ual per&s;picuous and manly &s;tile, and concluded in the following words: <Q>As therefore it is perfectly clear to my under&s;tanding, that the a&s;&s;ent of the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives is not nece&s;&s;ary to the validity of a treaty: as the treaty with Great Britain exhi|bits, in it&s;elf, all the objects requiring legi&s;lative provi&s;ion; and on the&s;e the papers called for can throw no light; and as it is e&s;&s;ential to the due admini&s;tration of the government, that the boundaries fixed by the con&s;titution, between the different departments &s;hould be pre&s;erved,&mdash;a ju&s;t regard to the con&s;titution, and to the duty of my office, under all the circum&s;tances of this ca&s;e, forbid a compliance with your reque&s;t.</Q></P>
<P>In my remarks on this debate, I &s;hall confine my&s;elf to the call for the papers, the debate on the treaty it&s;elf furni&s;hing the be&s;t opportunity of re|marking on the participation of the Hou&s;e in the treaty making power.</P>
<P>There is nobody will deny, that the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives have <HI>a right</HI> to call for papers of every kind, relative to matters laid before them; nor will any one deny, that the Pre&s;ident has an
<PB N="113" REF="030221_0045_0FE529280D9FEE28">
equal <HI>right</HI> to refu&s;e them. The nece&s;&s;ity of the call can alone render it ju&s;tifiable in point of propriety, and, con&s;equently, if no &s;uch nece&s;&s;ity exi&s;ts, a refu&s;al on the part of the Pre&s;ident can|not be improper.</P>
<P>Three rea&s;ons were urged in favour of the call: 1. &s;omething might be di&s;covered that would ju&s;tify an impeachment; 2. the papers might throw light on &s;ome parts of the treaty; 3. they might contain &s;omething, which would tend to reconcile the peo|ple to that in&s;trument.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the fir&s;t of the&s;e; <HI>di&s;covering grounds for an impeachment,</HI> I would a&s;k, who could have been the object of this impeachment? not the Negociator certainly; for, whatever might be his conduct at the court of London, it had receiv|ed the &s;olemn &s;anction of the Pre&s;ident and Senate. He was charged with powers to make a treaty, he had done &s;o, and tho&s;e who had di&s;patched him, had approved and ratified the re&s;ult of his negoci|ation; if, therefore, there was any blame, it mu&s;t fall on tho&s;e unders who&s;e orders he acted, and not on him.</P>
<P>I pre&s;ume the idea of impeaching the Senate never entered the brains of even Virginians, and of cour&s;e the Pre&s;ident mu&s;t be the object. How an impeachment of General Wa&s;hington will &s;ound in the ears of others I know not, in mine it &s;ounds extremely har&s;h; and, when I compare him with tho&s;e who had the effrontery to &s;tart the idea, it is with difficulty I refrain from breaking through that re&s;pect, which is due to the a&s;&s;embly into which they have found the means to in&s;inuate them&s;elves. That <HI>they</HI> did not expect to find &s;omething that would furni&s;h grounds of impeachment I will not
<PB N="114" REF="030221_0046_0FE5290600B0BE18">
pretend to aver, for men are but too apt to judge of others by them&s;elves; but the only an&s;wer that &s;uch a &s;landerous in&s;inuation merits from us, is, &s;ilent contempt.</P>
<P>But, <HI>the papers might throw light on &s;ome parts of the treaty.</HI> Now, I, who am no &s;tates-man, God-knows, have read this treaty, and I think I under|&s;tand it perfectly well. It is in good plain Engli&s;h, and, though that may be one of its principal faults with the quibblers from the &s;outh, yet it ought to render explanatory papers unnece&s;&s;ary. Will any one of the Oppo&s;ition members &s;ay, that he does not under&s;tand the treaty? if he &s;ays &s;o, will it not be nece&s;&s;ary to &s;end him back to his con&s;tituents, or furni&s;h him with an interpreter? I confe&s;s that the outlandi&s;h gentlemen, &s;uch as Mr. <HI>Gallatin</HI> for example, may experience &s;erious difficulties on this account; but is this to authorize a call that would divulge all the &s;ecrets of the &s;tate? would it not be infinitely better to have the treaty tran&s;lated into <HI>Italian,</HI> or, like the French decrees of fraternity, into all the living languages? be&s;ides, let it be re|membered, that the papers called for are in Engli&s;h as well as the treaty, and of cour&s;e, tho&s;e who do not under&s;tand the latter would not under&s;tand the former.</P>
<P>I would by no means in&s;inuate here, that all the Oppo&s;ition members, who are not foreigners, are adequate to a full comprehen&s;ion of the treaty; for, though, like the <HI>Bourgois Gentilhomme,</HI> they talk tolerable good pro&s;e, without knowing it, their &s;peeches fully prove that they know but little of the merits of the treaty. And, to them, as to foreigners the &s;ame que&s;tion will apply: if they can|not under&s;tand the treaty, how are they to under|&s;tand
<PB N="115" REF="030221_0047_0FE5298E39E409B0">
the papers? mo&s;t people, I believe, will al|low, that a diplomatic corre&s;pondence is more dif|ficult to analy&s;e than the in&s;trument in que&s;tion, and, if &s;o, how is it po&s;&s;ible that the&s;e contracted minds &s;hould derive light from &s;uch a corre&s;pon|dence?</P>
<P>Some of the members of oppo&s;ition are, how|ever, of a different &s;tamp. The&s;e did not want light. They are ble&s;&s;ed with that in the extreme degree. The rays &s;trike on their minds with &s;uch force as to blind every principle of honour and hone&s;ty. From the fine&s;&s;e of the&s;e gentlemen what could have been expected for the papers? that pro|found politician patriot <HI>Madi&s;on</HI> found out <HI>five</HI> dif|ferent con&s;tructions of one &s;ingle clau&s;e of the con|&s;titution, and perhaps he would have found five times the number of every clau&s;e in the di&s;patches. Where or when could this have ended?</P>
<P>It is &s;omething truely a&s;toni&s;hing that papers, or any thing el&s;e, &s;hould, at this late hour, be called for, in order to throw light on the Briti&s;h treaty. There have been, upon a moderate computation, more than fifty volumes in folio written and printed on the &s;ubject; public meetings have been held on it in every corner of the Union; petitions by hun|dreds have been given in for and again&s;t it; and the in&s;trument it&s;elf has been in the hands of every one during the &s;pace of eight months. Where, then, do the&s;e people come from, who now want papers to throw light on the &s;ubject; if, indeed, they can prove, that they have been buried in the we&s;tern woods, plotting "political &s;ins" anew, or con&s;tantly occupied in driving their negro <HI>con&s;ti|tuents</HI> to the tobacco fields and home again, I &s;hall be ready to make an allowance for their ignorance;
<PB N="116" REF="030221_0048_0FE529AF3A94B828">
but, if they cannot prove this, if they have enjoy|ed the &s;ame means of information as tho&s;e enjoyed by every man in the <HI>free</HI> States, and are yet igno|rant of the merits or demerits of the treaty, I mu&s;t ab&s;olutely declare them too &s;tupid to judge of it at all, and totally unworthy of having an intricate dip|lomatic corre&s;pondence &s;ubmitted to their examina|tion.</P>
<P>But, allowing that the papers might have thrown light on &s;ome parts of the treaty, how was this ne|ce&s;&s;ary to their deciding on granting the &s;upplies nece&s;&s;ary to carry it into effect; for, it is for this purpo&s;e alone that a treaty is laid before them. We will &s;uppo&s;e, for a moment, that they had di&s;|covered that Mr. Jay had gone beyond, or fallen &s;hort of, his in&s;tructions; nay, we will even &s;uppo&s;e, that they had found as indubitable proofs of Engli&s;h corruption, as they have had of French corruption; how could that circum&s;tance have affected their de|ci&s;ion? If they have a right of exerci&s;ing their judg|ment with re&s;pect to a treaty, it mu&s;t be on the treaty it&s;elf, and that was before them. The means em|ployed in the negociation could not alter the in|&s;trument it&s;elf. It has a preci&s;e meaning, couched in terms which cannot be mi&s;under&s;tood, and on that meaning alone could they found their deci&s;ion. What an ideot of a connoi&s;&s;eur &s;hould we think him, who, upon the &s;ight of a picture, &s;hould call for the pencils and colours with which it was paint|ed, in order to form an opinion of its merits. Yet, exactly &s;uch was the call for papers relative to the treaty.</P>
<P>There was, however, another rea&s;on a&s;&s;igned: <HI>the&s;e papers might contain &s;omething, which would tend to reconcile the people to the in&s;trument.</HI> I could
<PB N="117" REF="030221_0049_0FE529319F4C7B50">
have excu&s;ed every thing but this gro&s;s, this palpa|ble hypocri&s;y. What! did the&s;e oppo&s;ition mem|bers de&s;ire to &s;ee &s;omething that would reconcile the people to the treaty! the&s;e very men who had, in ways more or le&s;s direct, &s;tipulated with the mob to oppo&s;e it. It is a fact well known, that the lea|ders among them had all written or made public &s;peeches repre&s;enting it as inimical to the rights and liberties of the people; the gentleman who brought forward the re&s;olution was one of tho&s;e who took the lead at New York, when the <HI>French</HI> and Ame|rican flags were hoi&s;ted again&s;t it, and when it was ab&s;olutely burnt before the hou&s;e of Governor Jay. And yet, the&s;e very men now pretend, that they wi&s;h for &s;omething that may reconcile the people to it! what an opinion mu&s;t they have of the Pre&s;ident, to &s;uppo&s;e him open to &s;uch barefaced deception; when men have long &s;ucceeded in this, or any way, they are apt to over rate their talents; it is not therefore &s;o very wonderful, that they &s;hould imagine it as ea&s;y to cajole General Wa&s;h|ington as their deluded con&s;tituents.</P>
<P>I have now done with the <HI>pretended</HI> motives of the re&s;olution (on which I mu&s;t confe&s;s I have ta|ken up too much of the reader's time) and &s;hall come to what I imagine to be the <HI>real</HI> motives of it.</P>
<P>To begin at the fountain head, the mind from which the mi&s;chievous and malicious idea fir&s;t i&s;&s;u|ed, it is tolerably well known, that the <HI>Living&s;tons</HI> harbour a mortal hatred again&s;t the family of his Excellency Governor <HI>Jay,</HI> which hatred is undoubt|edly paid back with contempt. The characters of the parties &s;ufficiently explain the cau&s;e. This is not the fir&s;t in&s;tance of private re&s;entment finding
<PB N="118" REF="030221_0050_0FE5293321E3F6E0">
its way into public a&s;&s;emblies. Something in the&s;e papers might have been found which, if properly handled, would have impre&s;&s;ed on the minds of the ignorant, a belief that Mr. Jay had abandoned their intere&s;ts; that he was partial to the Engli&s;h nation (which alone is a &s;ufficient crime) and that he felt little anxiety for the &s;ucce&s;s of the French. The &s;lighte&s;t expre&s;&s;ion, leaning this way, would have been tortured into the mo&s;t odious &s;ignificati|on by men who are capable of finding five differ|ent con&s;tructions of a &s;imple &s;entence. There could not be imagined a more complete method of rendering the worthy Envoy odious to the majo|rity, <HI>in numbers,</HI> of his State, and of preparing the way for his being rejected at another election.</P>
<P>But, though this might be the principle object with the "<HI>honourable</HI> mover," as he has been iro|nically called, yet we mu&s;t not &s;uppo&s;e all the mem|bers of oppo&s;ition to have no higher views. They undoubtedly participate with Mr. <HI>Living&s;ton</HI> in a dete&s;tation of the Envoy. I pre&s;ume this, becau&s;e it is natural; but their projects &s;eem to be much more exten&s;ive than the ou&s;ting of a governor. Their eyes are fixed on another quarter, where a nobler game pre&s;ents it&s;elf. In &s;hort, if I have any pene|tration, their plan is nothing &s;hort of driving the Pre&s;ident of the United States from the po&s;t he now fills.</P>
<P>If there be any one who, mea&s;uring the hearts of others by his own, looks upon this as impo&s;&s;ible, I reque&s;t him to turn his eye to the in&s;ults that have been heaped on this Saviour of his country during the pre&s;ent &s;e&s;&s;ion of Congre&s;s. The fact is, nobo|dy doubts of this, and the only thing that &s;urpri&s;es
<PB N="119" REF="030221_0051_0FE5296216A9E140">
me, is, nobody attempts to render the de&s;tructive project abortive.</P>
<P>It may be a&s;ked; what views can the oppo&s;ition have? to this que&s;tion I an&s;wer by another: what views have the di&s;organizers in every country? what views could the <HI>nobleman</HI> have who propo&s;ed, in France, the abolition of <HI>nobility?</HI> what views had the <HI>bi&s;hop</HI> who propo&s;ed the abolition of <HI>religion?</HI> what views had the &s;illy Lord Stanhope when he propo&s;ed an imitation of the French &s;ans-culottes, and declared <HI>he would like to be hanged?</HI> if there were any thing too &s;tupid, ab&s;urd and vile, to be wi&s;hed for by tho&s;e who are the partizans of France and of French principles, then we might enquire, what men could propo&s;e to them&s;elves in driving a Chief Magi&s;trate like ours from his po&s;t.</P>
<P>That they may not &s;ucceed is &s;urely the &s;incere de&s;ire of every man, who wi&s;hes well to this coun|try. But the event is, at lea&s;t, doubtful. It re|quires fortitude &s;omething more than human, to en|dure &s;uch treatment as the Pre&s;ident has received, without yielding to the dictates of di&s;gu&s;t. There is hardly a man on earth but him&s;elf, that would not have retired long ago. For my part, I &s;hould have hurled the papers in their face, in the mid&s;t of their quibbling and &s;piteful harrangues, &s;ent them my re&s;ignation and retired to my home. Hap|pily, General Wa&s;hington is a man of another cha|racter. But it is not rea&s;onable to hope, that he will bear this tantalizing for ever: there is a certain point beyond which the patience and fortitude of no man can go, and &s;hould his ungrateful enemies &s;urpa&s;s it, we mu&s;t expect to be left adrift in the &s;torm.</P>
<P><PB N="120" REF="030221_0052_0FE52907852AC8D0">I know, that it is become a cu&s;tom to &s;peak lightly of the &s;ervices, pa&s;t as well as pre&s;ent, of this great man, and that his adver&s;aries a&s;k, with a &s;ort of triumph; what! is America &s;o poor in ta|lents and virtue as not to po&s;&s;e&s;s another man fit for Pre&s;ident?&mdash;I am far from thinking any &s;uch thing. I believe there are many men in America of great talents and virtues, even equal to tho&s;e of General Wa&s;hington; but there is &s;omething more nece&s;&s;ary in the chief of this Union, which no man po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es but him&s;elf; and that is, <HI>Univer&s;al confi|dence.</HI> Some other man may be found, the favour|ite of this or that part of the Union; but no other, of every part of it.

<P>The&s;e con&s;iderations ought to unite the friends of order and good government in their attachment to the man of their choice.

<P>It is a truth, which cannot be too often repeated, that the oppo&s;ers of the Briti&s;h treaty are for the mo&s;t part, men who have long and &s;teadily oppo&s;|ed every &s;alutary mea&s;ure of the general govern|ment, joined by &s;uch as this treaty obliged to pay their ju&s;t debts. It is well known that it is again&s;t the Southern States alone that the Briti&s;h mer|chants complain, and for this rea&s;on it is that we &s;ee the members from tho&s;e States mo&s;t oppo&s;ed to it. All the names in the above li&s;ts, written in <HI>italicks,</HI> are of members coming from States to the North of Virginia, from which it will appear, that only two members from the Southern States voted in the minority.

<P>The Hou&s;e having re&s;olved it&s;elf into a committee of the whole on the Me&s;&s;age from the Pre&s;ident, <HI>Mr. Blount,</HI> (from North Carolina) moved the following re&s;olutions, which were finally pa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>Re&s;olved, that, it being declared by the &s;econd &s;ection of the &s;econd article of the con&s;titution, <Q>that the Pre|&s;ident &s;hall have power, by and with the advice and con&s;ent of the Senate, to make treaties, provided two thirds of the Senate pre&s;ent concur,</Q> the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives do not claim any agency in <HI>making treaties;</HI> but that when a treaty &s;tipulates regulations <HI>on any of the &s;ubjects &s;ubmitted by the con&s;titution to the power of Congre&s;s,</HI> it mu&s;t depend for its execution, as to &s;uch &s;tipulations, on a law or laws to be pa&s;&s;ed by Congre&s;s, and it is the con|&s;titutional

right and duty of the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives; in all &s;uch ca&s;es, to deliberate on the expediency or inex|pediency of carrying &s;uch treaties into effect, and to de|termine and act thereon, as in <HI>their judgment</HI> may be mo&s;t conducive to the public good.</P>
<P>Re&s;olved, that it is not nece&s;&s;ary to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> any application from this Hou&s;e to the Executive for in|formation de&s;ired by them, and which may relate to any con&s;titutional functions of the Hou&s;e, that the purpo&s;es for which &s;uch information may be wanted, or to which the &s;ame may be applied, &s;hould be &s;tated in the application.</P>
<P>On the latter of the&s;e re&s;olutions it is only nece&s;|&s;ary to ob&s;erve, that it is by no means incon&s;i&s;tent with the motives that dictated the call for papers; tho&s;e motives I have already &s;tated, it will there|fore be u&s;ele&s;s to &s;ay anything more on the re&s;olution.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t re&s;olution merits a great deal of atten|tion, as it &s;eems, to be the la&s;ting definition of the treaty making power.</P>
<P><HI>Patriot Madi&s;on</HI> was the only member that en|tered into a defence of this re&s;olution. To give his &s;peech here would be to fill up my pages with what no one would read: I &s;hall, therefore, con|tent my&s;elf with in&s;erting an extract from the de|bates in the Virginia Convention, at the time when the Con&s;titution of the United States was under con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>The reader &s;hould be informed, that this <HI>patriot</HI> was, at the time of forming the con&s;titution, a firm friend to it; and indeed, I have &s;een it a&s;&s;erted in print, that he even drew it up. Let us, then, compare the explanation he gave of this treaty mak|ing clau&s;e, at the time the con&s;titution was under
<PB N="124" REF="030221_0056_0FE4FE5EC4DE6620">
con&s;ideration, with the explanation contained in the re&s;olution which he now &s;upports.</P>
<P>A member in the convention having objected to the treaty making power, as expre&s;&s;ed in the con|&s;titution, becau&s;e treaties became &s;upreme laws of the land, <HI>without the participation of Congre&s;s,</HI> pa|triot Madi&s;on ro&s;e and &s;aid: <Q><HI>Are not treaties the law of the land in England?</HI> I will refer you to a book, which is in every man's hand, Black|&s;tone's Commentaries. It will inform you, that treaties, <HI>made by the king,</HI> are to be the &s;upreme laws of the land. <HI>If they are to have any effi|cacy they mu&s;t be laws of the land.</HI> They are &s;o <HI>in every country.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Now where has the patriot been &s;ince the time that he gave this explanation of the treaty making power? what &s;ort of company mu&s;t he have fallen into? I &s;hould be very &s;orry to &s;uppo&s;e that he has drank at the fountain that poi&s;oned his countryman Randolph; but, really &s;uch a change of &s;entiment &s;uch directly contradictory explanation of the very &s;ame clau&s;e, is hard to be accounted for.</P>
<P>In this debate on the call for the papers, which was, in fact, a debate on the treaty making power, the patriot was &s;everal times called on for an ex|planation of his doctrine advanced in the conven|tion. He had the prudence to avoid an an&s;wer at that time; and to re&s;erve him&s;elf for the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the pre&s;ent re&s;olution. He tells us here, that, upon <HI>his honour,</HI> he has <HI>forgotten</HI> what pa&s;&s;ed in the convention; but that, however <HI>re&s;pectable</HI> &s;uch au|thorities may be, the con&s;titution mu&s;t now <HI>ex|plain it&s;elf.</HI>&mdash;And &s;o, Sir, you have <HI>forgotten,</HI> have you? Forgotten all about it? the waters of Virgi|nia,
<PB N="125" REF="030221_0057_0FE52914E87B0598">

<P>But, though Mr. Madi&s;on had been dipped in the pool of oblivion, &s;ome other members of the Hou&s;e had not, and as they made &s;o pre&s;&s;ing a call on him for the explanation, he was obliged to &s;ay &s;omething. It was not certainly a very &s;atisfactory an&s;wer, to &s;ay that, however <HI>re&s;pectable</HI> &s;uch autho|rities might be, the con&s;titution mu&s;t now <HI>explain it&s;elf.</HI> As to the <HI>re&s;pectability</HI> of the authority, as far as relates to him&s;elf, I am ready to give that up; but how the con&s;titution is to explain it&s;elf, when he has found out five different con&s;tructions of the &s;ame clau&s;e, I cannot perceive. If it be true, that he penned the con&s;titution, I hope he will not boa&s;t of his work, unle&s;s, indeed, which is not impo&s;&s;i|ble, he wi&s;hed it to an&s;wer all the convenient pur|po&s;es of a Je&s;uit's Creed.</P>
<P>The Pre&s;ident, in his me&s;&s;age, tells the Hou&s;e, with the candour and uprighthne&s;s of heart which &s;o eminently di&s;tingui&s;h him from his adver&s;aries, that, the treaty making power has been thus un|der&s;tood by both parties in the negociations with foreign powers. "It is thus," &s;ays he, <Q>that the treaty making power has been under&s;tood by foreign nations; and in all treaties made with them, <HI>we</HI> have declared, and they have believed, that when ratified by the Pre&s;ident, with the ad|vice
<PB N="126" REF="030221_0058_0FE529BA0D1142B8">
and con&s;ent of the Senate, they became ob|ligatory.</Q>&mdash;To this Mr. Madi&s;on replies: <Q>By <HI>we</HI> was to be under&s;tood the executive alone, and not the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives.</Q> Again he ob&s;erves that <Q>this was the fir&s;t treaty made with a <HI>foreign</HI> power, &s;ince the operation of the pre&s;ent government; and that therefore prece|dents mu&s;t lo&s;e much of their weight.</Q></P>
<P>What the patriot means by a <HI>foreign</HI> power, I know not: it is more than probable that, in his ample budget of con&s;tructions, he may have a dozen or two ready to be applied to his word <HI>fo|reign;</HI> but, according to my &s;imple conception of the meaning of this epithet, it is applicable to every power with whom the United States have made, or can make, treaties; and of cour&s;e, it ought to be applied to the Indian as well as to the European na|tions. The continental powers of Europe are all &s;ituated on the &s;ame land; &s;ome of them mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be divided by land-marks, as we are from the Indians, yet they treat each other as <HI>fo|reign</HI> powers. If the word <HI>foreign</HI> is to be applied to no nation &s;ituated on the &s;ame land with our&s;elves, it is yet to be proved, whether it ought to be appli|ed to France and Spain, or not. Indeed, it is likely, that the patriot means to confine the word <HI>foreign</HI> to the Briti&s;h nation, as the only one which is divided from us by the &s;ea; if &s;o, and if he &s;hould be able to per&s;uade us, that his <HI>con&s;truction</HI> is a good one, we may then allow, that this treaty is the fir&s;t which the Federal Government has form|ed with foreign powers; but, till he can do this, I for my part, mu&s;t continue to look upon the trea|ties made with the Indians, as made with foreign powers.</P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="030221_0059_0FE5297308865F80">If then it be true, and true it mo&s;t a&s;&s;uredly is, that the treaties made with the Indians, bear in them&s;elves the full force of the principle laid down by the Pre&s;ident: <Q>that when ratified by the Pre|&s;ident and Senate, they become obligatory,</Q> how happens it, that no objection was ever yet made to their contents in that re&s;pect? foreign na|tions have &s;een tho&s;e treaties go quietly into effect, without waiting for the &s;anction of the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives; and this, of it&s;elf, was a decla|ration of the whole nation, that no &s;uch &s;anction was nece&s;&s;ary. But, &s;ays the patriot, "the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives never made any &s;uch declara|tion;" and for this very rea&s;on; becau&s;e no &s;uch declaration was wanted. The Pre&s;ident and Senate ratified the treaties, and nobody di&s;puted their au|thority &s;o to do; the unmaking power of the Hou&s;e was re&s;erved to be exerci&s;ed on the pre&s;ent oc|ca&s;ion.</P>
<P>Had the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the power of &s;etting a treaty a&s;ide, or rather as they now contend, of giving it a final ratification, they &s;hould have come forward and declared &s;o, when the fir&s;t treaty made under the pre&s;ent government was laid before them. This would have been can|didly telling other powers not to look upon a treaty as finally ratified by the United States, till it had been approved of by the Hou&s;e; and, in the pre&s;ent in&s;tance, the king of great Britain would not have been deceived into a ratification on his part, till &s;uch approbation had been obtained.</P>
<P>Taking leave of the tergiver&s;ation of patriot Madi&s;on, I &s;hall add a few &s;hort remarks on the re&s;o|lution it&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="128" REF="030221_0060_0FE52934A9557B60">One of its greate&s;t faults is, its unnece&s;&s;ary length; it is however, like all the other propo&s;itions brought forward by the Oppo&s;ition: calculated to deceive the multitude, and rally them under the banners of an intere&s;ted and, perhaps, corrupted faction, under the pretext of &s;upporting their rights. The plain meaning of it is this: <HI>The Pre&s;ident and Senate have a right to</HI> make <HI>treaties, and the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives to</HI> unmake <HI>them;</HI> and Mr. Blount, if he had had as much courage as malice, would have couched it in the&s;e very words.</P>
<P><Q>When a treaty, &s;ays the re&s;olution, &s;tipu|lates regulations on any &s;ubjects &s;ubmitted by the Con&s;titution to the power of Congre&s;s, it mu&s;t depend for its execution on Congre&s;s,</Q> and con|&s;eqently, on the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives. Seve|ral regulations are &s;ubmitted to the power of Con|gre&s;s: I &s;hall confine my&s;elf to one only, as &s;uffi|cient to demon&s;trate the con&s;equences of the doc|trine here held up. "Congre&s;s," &s;ays the Con&s;ti|tution <Q><HI>is empowered</HI> to regulate commerce with fo|reign nations.</Q> Now what treaty, let me a&s;k, can the United States make with any nation on earth, <HI>not containing &s;tipulations on commerce?</HI> what treaty can be formed with Great Britain, with Spain, with the Algerines, or even with the Indians, that does not contain &s;tipulations of this kind? There are treaties with them all now before the Hou&s;e, and they all do contain &s;uch &s;tipulations. It fol|lows, of cour&s;e, that the Pre&s;ident and Senate can make no treaty, that can be carried into execution without the con&s;ent, or ratification of the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives.</P>
<P>Yes, there are treaties of alliance offen&s;ive or defen&s;ive, or both, which may not contain &s;tipula|lations
<PB N="129" REF="030221_0061_0FE529651FE1B670" MS="y">
on commerce; but then, the Congre&s;s has the power to declare war, and as the&s;e are certainly warlike regulations, the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives will undoubtedly claim a participation in making them, or at lea&s;t in unmaking them, according to the &s;pirit of the re&s;olution. So that, the Pre&s;ident and Senate's treaty making power is, in fact, no power at all. It is a mere form of words; a de|ception thrown out to give foreign nations a be|lief of the &s;tability and promptitude of this govern|ment; in order to lure them into <HI>conce&s;&s;ions,</HI> while the <HI>real</HI> power is re&s;erved for annulling &s;uch treaties, as fall &s;hort of the exorbitant preten&s;ions, or mili|tate again&s;t the intere&s;ted views, of the&s;e States.</P>
<P>If a vote of the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives be nece&s;&s;ary to the <HI>ratification</HI> of a treaty; I &s;ay rati|fication becau&s;e that ACT alone is worthy of the name, which gives full and complete effect to a treaty; if then, a vote of this Hou&s;e be nece&s;&s;ary to &s;uch ratification, it &s;hould be obtained <HI>before</HI> the ratification be di&s;patched to a foreign court. Any other manner of proceeding is mere duplicity. What &s;ays the treaty before us: <Q>This treaty, when the &s;ame &s;hall have been ratified by His Ma|je&s;ty, and by the Pre&s;ident of the United States, by and with the advice and con&s;ent of their Senate, and the re&s;pective ratifications mutually ex|changed, &s;hall be binding and obligatory on His Maje&s;ty and on the &s;aid States, &amp;c.</Q> Now, this has been done; the treaty has been ratified by His Maje&s;ty and by the Pre&s;ident, with the con&s;ent of the Senate, and yet the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives pretend, that it is <HI>not</HI> binding on the&s;e States, with|out <HI>their con&s;ent</HI> al&s;o. Is this duplicity, or is it &s;omething wor&s;e!</P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="030221_0062_0FE529166C444680">Suppo&s;e the po&s;ts, which are, in fulfilment of this treaty, to be delivered up to the United States, were &s;ituated in &s;ome part of Europe, where no intelligence of this re&s;olution could be obtained in due time to prevent the delivery; or &s;uppo&s;e the treaty had &s;tipulated for the we&s;tern po&s;ts being gi|ven up in the month of December la&s;t. Had either of the&s;e been the ca&s;e, Great Britain would have fulfilled her engagement, in this re&s;pect, while the United States are debating with them&s;elves <HI>whether they &s;hall fulfil theirs or not.</HI> What &s;ort of national faith is this? to make u&s;e of the words of Mr. Giles re&s;pecting the land jobbers, this is <HI>&s;windling upon a broad &s;cale,</HI> indeed.</P>
<P>This re&s;olution, whatever may be the fate of the Briti&s;h treaty, will have the mo&s;t pernicious effects on the relations of the United States with foreign nations. If the mini&s;ters of any power can be &s;uppo&s;ed to under&s;tand this Con&s;titution, it mu&s;t be tho&s;e of Great Britain. We &s;ee, that they have under&s;tood it as giving the &s;ole power of making and ratifying treaties to the Pre&s;ident and Senate; and it is certain that other powers have, till now under&s;tood it in the &s;ame way. But, the re&s;oluti|on of <HI>patriot</HI> Blount is well calculated to undeceive them. All nations will now &s;ay: <Q>Yes, the Ame|ricans have a Pre&s;ident and Senate, whom they hold forth to us as officers empowered to make treaties with us, and to give &s;uch treaties their full effect, as "&s;upreme laws of their land;" but we now perceive that this is all deception; the&s;e officers are only authorized to make and ratify <HI>&s;ham</HI> treaties with us; if they obtain their wi&s;hes, they confirm the&s;e treaties afterwards, but if not, they re|&s;erve to them&s;elves the power of &s;etting them a&s;ide.</Q> In future, therefore, we mu&s;t naturally expect, that
<PB N="131" REF="030221_0063_0FE52937A03AC350">
no power on earth, except, perhaps, a humiliated king of Spain, or a &s;tupid Indian Chief, will ever look upon a treaty with us as legally ratified, till it has received the &s;anction of the Hou&s;e of Repre|&s;entatives; nay, were I a prince, I would not ratify, till the treaty had been &s;igned by every individual mem|ber of the &s;overeign people; for, as <HI>patriot</HI> Madi&s;on judiciou&s;ly ob&s;erved, <Q>there is a <HI>provident</HI> article in the Con&s;titution it&s;elf, by which an avenue is always left open to the <HI>&s;overeign people</HI> for <HI>expla|nations or amendments,</HI> as they may be found indi&s;pen&s;able.</Q></P>
<P>Here I &s;hall be told, that the Briti&s;h Hou&s;e of Commons po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the &s;ame power, with re&s;pect to treaties as is contended for by the Hou&s;e of Repre|&s;entatives, and yet, that does not prevent other nations from treating with the king of Great Bri|tain. If any incon&s;i&s;tency on the part of the Op|po&s;ition could at this day excite &s;urprize, it would be their having held up the practices of Great Britain as proper for their imitation. What! the&s;e very men, who&s;e continual theme has been the execrating of the practices of that nation, now fly to it for precidents! the fir&s;t writer that appear|ed in oppo&s;ition to the Briti&s;h treaty, repre&s;ented it as dangerous, becau&s;e it would <Q>tend to the in|troduction of the fa&s;hions, forms and <HI>precedents</HI> of a monarchy!</Q> <HI>Mr. Giles</HI> &s;aid, in the de|bate concerning Randall, that <Q>he &s;hould be <HI>&s;orry</HI> to &s;ee <HI>this Hou&s;e</HI> adopt <HI>precedents</HI> from the Briti&s;h Hou&s;e of Commons!</Q> &s;everal times during this very debate, it was averred that the Con&s;titution of Great Britain was ju&s;t crumbling to pieces; and it is no long|er ago than la&s;t year, that the &s;agacious <HI>patriot</HI> Madi|&s;on foretold, that he &s;hould &s;oon &s;ee the peers of Great Britain coming to a&s;k a lodging from him. Mr. Swanwick, in the debates on the frigates, &s;aid that
<PB N="132" REF="030221_0064_0FE5298FC0FAA028">
Great Britain was on the verge of ruin. Another of the&s;e oppo&s;ers declared &s;he was at her la&s;t ga&s;p. And the&s;e are the men, who now tell us, that imi|tating Great Britain is the only way of pre&s;erving the liberties of the people; while they &s;eize every opportunity mo&s;t &s;landerou&s;ly to repre&s;ent the peo|ple of that country as &s;laves.</P>
<P>But, what are the&s;e precedents which they have taken from the Con&s;titution of Great Britain? they tell us that the Hou&s;e of Commons claim a right to withhold the &s;upplies nece&s;&s;ary to carry a treaty into effect. They claim this right with re|&s;pect to all &s;upplies; but, were they ever known to exerci&s;e it &s;ince the reign of the profligate french|ified Charles? at lea&s;t, were they ever known to exerci&s;e it for the purpo&s;e of violating a treaty made with a foreign power? I defy the&s;e gentlemen to prove any &s;uch thing, and even if they could prove it, I would be very glad to know, how the precedent will apply to them&s;elves. The Briti&s;h Con&s;titution, happily for the people of that coun|try, is not written in a book; is not reduced to a few clau&s;es, each of which admits of <HI>five con|&s;tructions.</HI> There is no po&s;itive law that &s;ays to the Hou&s;e of Commons; <Q>you &s;hall have no de|liberative voice on the expediency or inexpedien|cy of treaties.</Q> This is not nece&s;&s;ary in a go|vernment like that of Great Britain. The organ|ization of the Hou&s;e of Commons is it&s;elf a gua|rantee for their doing nothing that may endanger the honour or &s;afety of the State. The electors there are few; the members are the repre&s;entatives of property, and not of numbers. They are elect|ed for &s;even years, and not for two. They are independent of the mob, a much better &s;ecurity for the &s;tate, than their being independent of tho&s;e
<PB N="133" REF="030221_0065_0FE5296FFA3B7498">
who &s;it at the helm of affairs. There is not, I am per&s;uaded, a man in that Hou&s;e, who could, under any circum&s;tances, bring him&s;elf to avow openly, that "he <HI>adored</HI> the voice of the people," as Mr. Giles did in the debate on the call for pa|pers. There is not the mo&s;t di&s;tant re&s;emblance between the Hou&s;e of Commons and the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives; and therefore the citing of prece|dents from the records of each other mu&s;t be to|tally inadmi&s;&s;ible. In one particular, however, I am willing to allow that the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;en|tatives would do well in imitating the Hou&s;e of Commons, and here, I believe I &s;hall be &s;econded by every hone&s;t man in the Union; I mean in making provi&s;ion for carrying the pre&s;ent treaty into effect.</P>
<P>In the Philadelphia Gazette of la&s;t year I find the following words, made u&s;e of by <HI>Mr. Giles</HI> in the debate on the allowances to members of Congre&s;s. <Q>Mr. Giles &s;aid, there was a country from which America had <HI>copied</HI> a great deal <HI>too much.</HI> The members of the Briti&s;h Hou&s;e of Commons re|ceived no wages, while the officers of &s;tate had immen&s;e &s;alaries. It was, however, <HI>under&s;tood</HI> that the Briti&s;h Hou&s;e of Commons were very <HI>well paid.</HI> Mr. Giles did not wi&s;h to &s;ee <HI>&s;cenes</HI> of that kind <HI>in this country.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Now, would it, I wonder, be permitted me to a&s;k this talkative gentleman, what he meant by "&s;cenes"? If this were permitted, I would go on, and a&s;k him, what he meant by <HI>copying too much</HI> from Great Britain? if he him&s;elf be a copy of &s;ome original from that country, which I believe to be the ca&s;e, in this in&s;tance I &s;hall not contend, that we have not copied too much; but as to wa|ges
<PB N="134" REF="030221_0066_0FE52917F0F95A80">
to members of Congre&s;s, I think we have not copied quite enough, witne&s;s a &s;e&s;&s;ion &s;pun out to the month of May, and nothing done. Again, I would a&s;k him, how he came to <HI>under&s;tand</HI> that the members of the Briti&s;h Hou&s;e of Commons were very <HI>well paid,</HI> or in other words, <HI>corrupted by the King?</HI> he knows how &s;everely I could retort upon him here; how I could dare him to a com|pari&s;on; but I forbear, and return to the &s;entence of this extract which &s;o immediately applies to the &s;ubject before us.</P>
<P>It is well known, that the members of the Hou&s;e of Commons receive no &s;tipend for their &s;ervices in that capacity, therefore, when the propo&s;al be|fore the Hou&s;e was to draw money out of the pockets of the people to pay Mr. Giles and his colleagues &s;uch a &s;tipend, he thought America &s;hould not copy from Great Britain. Imitating the Hou&s;e of Commons in this in&s;tance, would have deprived the gentleman of what he probably <HI>"adored"</HI> as much as he does "the voice of the people," and, perhaps, a great deal more. The Hou&s;e of Commons was therefore thrown a&s;ide, as totally unworthy of imitation; but, when &s;ome|thing from the records of that Hou&s;e &s;eemed to &s;trengthen the arguments of Mr. Giles for &s;etting a&s;ide the treaty, then it was not wrong to copy from it: it was to be imitated as the only model; as the only a&s;&s;embly in the world, that was the true repo&s;itory of the liberties of the people.&mdash; The&s;e palpable incon&s;i&s;tencies I leave Mr. Giles to reconcile, which I make no doubt he will be able to do, to the entire &s;atisfaction of <HI>his</HI> con&s;tituents.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now di&s;mi&s;s this re&s;olution of citizen Blount, with ob&s;erving, that if no treaty, <HI>contain|ing
<PB N="135" REF="030221_0067_0FE5299144D050A8">
&s;tipulations on commerce,</HI> is finally ratified till &s;anctioned by a vote of the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;enta|tives, no treaty, formed by the pre&s;ent government is yet valid; for though that with Spain for in|&s;tance has been &s;anctioned by the Hou&s;e, &s;uch &s;anction was not obtained prior to the ratification by the king of Spain. The ratification which that king now po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es is not valid, and therefore the treaty is not. This is clear and fair rea&s;oning, and I defy even patriot Madi&s;on, with his five con|&s;tructions, to oppo&s;e it with &s;ucce&s;s. Is it a&s;&s;erted that the ratification now in the hands of the court of Spain is binding on the United States? &s;o then, is the ratification now in the hands of His Britan|nic Maje&s;ty; for they have both emanated from exactly the &s;ame powers. If the ratification ex|changed with Great Britain be not final, be not ob|ligatory, neither is that exchanged with Spain; the kings of both nations have been duped; they have exchanged obligatory ratifications for &s;uch as were not obligatory, and of cour&s;e, both the trea|ties become null and void: nor &s;hould I &s;cruple, were I the mini&s;ter of either of tho&s;e princes, to advi&s;e an infraction of either treaty, when circum|&s;tances might render it convenient; fully confident that this re&s;olution of the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives would ju&s;tify the proceeding.</P>

alter the nature of &s;acrifices contained in the trea|ty it&s;elf? If an infraction of this treaty &s;hould take place on the part of Great Britain, to what &s;hould we appeal? to the treaty it&s;elf, and not to the notes and conver&s;ations employed in the negociation. The in&s;trument it&s;elf is good or bad, and contains in it|&s;elf full proofs of either, and, if the Hou&s;e have a right to decide on its merits, why not do it bold|ly; why not &s;corn this mi&s;erable &s;ubterfuge?</P>

Ac|cording to the re&s;olution of Mr. Blount, now on the journals of the Hou&s;e, the treaty is not a law of this land; it is not in force; it is not yet a treaty; and con&s;equently the Briti&s;h can be guilty of no infraction. Do the Oppo&s;ition wi&s;h, that this in&s;trument &s;hould be obligatory on Great Bri|tain, from the moment of the &s;igning of the ratifi|cations
<PB N="138" REF="030221_0070_0FE529BE4DDB3208">
as they now &s;tand, and that it &s;hould not even yet be obligatory on the&s;e States? they may, probably, find powers to treat with them on this footing; a king of &s;calpes, the five kings of France (barber Tom and his comrades four) or a degene|rate &s;cion of the &s;tump of the Bourbons, may, per|haps, do it; but the king of Great Britain never will.</P>
<P>After the&s;e remarks on this hypoctritical and ab|&s;urd preamble, I &s;hall endeavour to point out the fatal con&s;equences that the adoption of the re&s;olution mu&s;t be attended with, taking, previou&s;ly, a view of the cau&s;es which have led to the pre&s;ent oppo&s;i|tion. If, in doing this, I make u&s;e of an undi&s;|gui&s;ed language, which, notwith&s;tanding the boa&s;t|ed liberty of the pre&s;s, is little cu&s;tomary in the&s;e States, I hope, my liege Lords, the &s;overeign-citi|zens, will not take offence, as I declare upon my honour, that my motive, and my only motive, is, to per&s;uade them to live in peace with the only power on earth that is capable of doing them an injury in war.</P>
<P>Among the cau&s;es of the oppo&s;ition to the treaty, the &s;tipulation for an honourable di&s;charge of the debts, due from the Southern States (<HI>Virginia</HI> in particular) to the merchants of Great Britain, cer|tainly claims the fir&s;t place. The&s;e debts, due be|fore the American war, were, according to the treaty of peace, to be honourably di&s;charged; or, at lea&s;t, no law was to be pa&s;&s;ed, or to remain in force, which might operate as an impediment to their recovery. Here is the article of the treaty: <Q><HI>Art.</HI> IV. It is agreed, that creditors on ei|ther &s;ide, <HI>&s;hall meet with no lawful impediment</HI> to
<PB N="139" REF="030221_0071_0FE528B4B0F83D58">
the recovery of the full value, in &s;terling money, of all <HI>bona fide</HI> debts heretofore contracted.</Q></P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding this, in defiance of the general government, and regardle&s;s of the national faith, thus &s;olemnly pledged, the State of Virginia in particular has enacted, or kept in force, &s;uch laws as are an impediment to the recovery of the&s;e debts. In con&s;equence of this violation of the treaty of peace, and as a protection due from Great Britain to her merchants, &s;he kept po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the We&s;|tern Po&s;ts, in order to oblige the United States to a fulfilment of their engagements. The <HI>debtor</HI> State, or States, have continued their di&s;honoura|ble laws in force to this day, and for this rea&s;on it is, that to this day Great Britain keeps the forts in her po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>When a new treaty between the two nations was to be made, the relingui&s;hment of the po&s;ts was the fir&s;t object on the part of Great Britain, and accordingly, the treaty &s;ets out with a &s;tipula|tion for their being given up, <HI>on the fir&s;t day of June</HI> 1796, five weeks from this day. But, on the other hand, the United States &s;tipulate to pay, or cau&s;e to be paid, the abovementioned debts, the recovery of which has been hitherto unju&s;tly imped|ed, by acts which the Virginians have the a&s;&s;ur|ance to dignify with the names of laws.</P>
<P>It was not to be &s;uppo&s;ed that Virginia would not oppo&s;e to this arrangement. Both her Senators &s;tepped forward again&s;t the treaty. One of them, Mr. Ma&s;on divulged its contents prematurely. It was printed without the permi&s;&s;ion of the Executive power; agents were di&s;patched with it to every part of the Union, with in&s;tructions to mi&s;repre&s;ent its meaning, and to &s;tir up &s;uch an oppo&s;ition as might

<P>I mu&s;t beg to be excu&s;ed for &s;tepping a&s;ide from my &s;ubject a minute, in order to make a few ob&s;ervations, of a more general nature, on the conduct of this turbulent, and I may &s;ay rebellious State. One of her Repre&s;entatives in Congre&s;s, Mr. Giles &s;aid, <Q>that he hoped Virginia would pur&s;ue uniformly the line of conduct that had ever marked her political character. Her con|duct, he ob&s;erved, had been uniform from the beginning of the revolution to the pre&s;ent day; uniform and exemplary in her <HI>obedience to the laws,</HI> &amp;c.&mdash;He prided him&s;elf in repre&s;ening &s;uch a State.</Q> About a <HI>twentieth part</HI> of &s;uch
<PB N="141" REF="030221_0073_0FE5297EE09E24B8">
a State, the gentleman meant, without doubt; that is, if he did not, for the moment, mean to give up his title of "<HI>immediate</HI> repre&s;entative."</P>
<P>Indeed, as Mr. Giles ob&s;erved, the conduct of his State has been uniform, if a continual di&s;affec|tion to the government of the United States, &s;ome|times concealed under the ma&s;k of hypocri&s;y and ba&s;e crawling flattery, and &s;ometimes breaking out in open oppo&s;ition; if this be a uniform conduct, her conduct has been uniform. The reader mu&s;t have remarked the word <HI>"Briti&s;h Tyrant."</HI> in the above adverti&s;ement, and he mu&s;t al&s;o know that to abu&s;e and vilify that monarch is the favourite theme of Virginians. Now, to give him a pretty correct idea of the uniformity of their political conduct, I &s;hall here in&s;ert an extract from the American Magazine for September, 1769. <Q>We your Maje&s;ty's <HI>mo&s;t loyal, dutiful,</HI> and <HI>affectionate &s;ub|jects,</HI> of your Maje&s;ty's ancient colony of Virgi|nia, beg leave in the <HI>humble&s;t manner,</HI> to a&s;&s;ure your Maje&s;ty, that your faithful Subjects of this colony, ever di&s;tingui&s;hed by their loyalty and firm attachment to your Maje&s;ty and your royal ance&s;tors, &amp;c. &amp;c. We are <HI>ready to &s;acrifice our lives and fortunes</HI> in defence of your Maje&s;ty's <HI>&s;acred</HI> per&s;on and government.&mdash;It is with the deepe&s;t concern and mo&s;t <HI>heart felt grief</HI> that your Maje&s;ty's dutiful &s;ubjects of this colony find that their loyalty hath been <HI>traduced</HI> and that tho&s;e mea&s;ures which a ju&s;t regard for the <HI>Briti&s;h Con&s;titution (dearer to them than life)</HI> made nece&s;&s;ary duties, have been mi&s;repre&s;ented as rebellious attacks on your Maje&s;ty's govern|ment.&mdash;After expre&s;&s;ing our confidence in your royal <HI>wi&s;dom</HI> and <HI>goodne&s;s,</HI> permit us to a&s;&s;ure your Maje&s;ty, that the mo&s;t fervent prayers of your
<PB N="142" REF="030221_0074_0FE5298082FCEC50">
people of this colony are <HI>daily addre&s;&s;ed to the Almighty,</HI> that your Maje&s;ty's reign may be long and pro&s;perous over Great Britain and all your Dominions; and that after death, your Maje&s;ty may ta&s;te the fulle&s;t fruition of eternal bli&s;s, and that a de&s;cendant of your illu&s;trious Hou&s;e may reign over the extended Briti&s;h Empire <HI>until time &s;hall be no more.</HI></Q> AMEN!</P>
<P>The man who&s;e <HI>&s;acred</HI> per&s;on they were ready to &s;acrifice life and fortune in defence of, is now called the <HI>"Briti&s;h Tyrant;"</HI> and <HI>"the Briti&s;h Con|&s;titutution, dearer to them than life;"</HI> is now, <HI>"the gall|ing yoke of Great Britain!"</HI> Poor bankrupt devils, the king of great Britain &s;tands in no need of their lives and fortunes nor of their prayers daily addre&s;|&s;ed to the Almighty. Neither do their cur&s;es affect him a bit more than tho&s;e of the French athei&s;ts. I dare &s;ay, if the truth were known, that he does not think half &s;o much about the "ancient and dutiful and loyal and pious State of Virginia" as he does about the kennel of his Stag-Hounds.</P>
<P>Another trait of the uniformity of conduct in this State is exhibited in her behaviour to the Pre&s;i|dent of the United States. After his election, he received the fir&s;t addre&s;s from the Virginians. I can &s;ay nothing better nor wor&s;e of this addre&s;s, than that it was full as dutiful, affectionate and <HI>&s;incere,</HI> as the addre&s;s to the king. Let any man compare that addre&s;s with the in&s;ults that this in|&s;olent State, and her members in Congre&s;s, have heaped on the Pre&s;ident during the la&s;t nine months, and then doubt of the uniformity of the conduct of Virginia, if he can.</P>
<P><PB N="143" REF="030221_0075_0FE529820689CC30">But Mr. Giles &s;ays, <Q>Virginia has been uniform and exemplary in her <HI>obedience to the laws.</HI></Q> I &s;hall mention but two in&s;tances of this. The fir&s;t is, her having ab&s;olutely di&s;obeyed the treaty of peace, by making, or keeping in force, acts which have hitherto prevented the fulfilment of that treaty, and which had nearly plunged the Union into a war. The &s;econd in&s;tance is, her having attempted, during this very &s;e&s;&s;ion of Congre&s;s, to rai&s;e up an oppo&s;ition to the government in every State in the Union, and even to de&s;troy the Con&s;titution. If the&s;e in&s;tances of her <HI>"obedience to the laws"</HI> were not &s;ufficient, one might add her in&s;tructions, to all her repre&s;entatives, to oppo&s;e the execution of the Briti&s;h Treaty, "a &s;upreme law of the land." Such are the proofs which Mr. Giles might have cited of her <Q>uniform and <HI>exemplary</HI> obedience to the laws.</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Giles may "pride him&s;elf in being a repre|&s;entative from "&s;uch a State;" but, I believe that few men, who do not <HI>adore</HI> <Q>the voice of the people,</Q> will envy him his po&s;t.</P>
<P>Who did not expect that every member from this State would do his utmo&s;t to &s;et the treaty a&s;ide? the final determination of the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives is not yet known; but I do not &s;cruple to declare all tho&s;e enemies of the treaty, who voted in favour of Mr. Blount's re&s;olution, and it is well known that every member from Vir|ginia is included in that number. Had the treaty been oppo&s;ed from any other motive than the one I contend for, &s;urely, out of eighteen members, &s;ome one would have been found not included in the oppo&s;ition.</P>
<P><PB N="144" REF="030221_0076_0FE528D6819D5480">If there are any particular members, among tho&s;e now leagued again&s;t the con&s;titution, who claim the guilty pre-eminence, it mu&s;t be tho&s;e who are ac|tuated by this &s;elfi&s;h, this di&s;graceful motive. It is a truth, and a truth that will be a la&s;ting &s;tigma on the American character, that, if this treaty be rendered null, it will be for no other rea&s;on, than <HI>becau&s;e it engages for a di&s;charge of ju&s;t debts,</HI> on the part of Americans.</P>
<P>I am far from wi&s;hing to in&s;inuate, that there are no honourable exceptions to be found among the people of Virginia: a recent attempt in their legi&s;lature to &s;ubject lands to &s;eizure for the pay|ment of debts is a full proof that &s;uch exceptions do exi&s;t; but in &s;peaking of a State we mu&s;t &s;peak of it as one; our opinions mu&s;t be founded on the mea&s;ures, it adopts, whether &s;uch mea&s;ures may be the effect of the unanimous voice of the people or not. In like manner foreign nations mu&s;t judge of the United States. If they fail in the fulfilment of their engagements; if the &s;windling propo&s;itions for an|nulling the treaty &s;hould finally &s;ucceed; foreign nations will pronounce on the mea&s;ure it&s;elf, with|out paying any attention to our internal di&s;putes and divi&s;ions. The minority will be lumped with the majority; the everla&s;ting &s;tain will imprint it&s;elf on the whole American people, not excepting the hitherto &s;potle&s;s character of a Wa&s;hington.</P>
<P>French influence is another &s;ource of oppo&s;ition to the treaty. Tho&s;e who have read Mr. Ran|dolph's Vindication, as it was humourou&s;ly called, have &s;een how narrowly the Pre&s;ident e&s;caped from the plots of that gentleman; what overtures were made to the French Mini&s;ter for <Q>&s;ome thou&s;ands of dollars." They will &s;ee how that "pretend|ed
<PB N="145" REF="030221_0077_0FE5299D4D0AF570">
patriot</Q> laboured to protract the ratification; how well his plans were laid for embroiling this country with Great Britain, and how all his mea|&s;ures were taken for &s;ubjecting the government of this country to France. I do not &s;ay, that any of the members, who now oppo&s;e the government and the treaty, are ab&s;olutely in the pay of the five kings; but, after reviewing the mutinous conduct of the Secretary of State; after having duly con&s;idered the rank of the per&s;on on who&s;e behalf, as well as his own, certain overtures were made; after having &s;een &s;ome of the men now in Congre&s;s, parti|cularly <HI>an incon&s;i&s;tent leader,</HI> named as a confiden|tial friend of <HI>Citizen Fauchet,</HI> I mu&s;t be excu&s;ed, if I have my doubts. Doubts I &s;hall have till I &s;ee tho&s;e, who now oppo&s;e the treaty, cea&s;e their eulogiums, their ful&s;ome and nau&s;eous eulo|giums, of a people, who, in their pre&s;ent &s;tate, are not entitled even to pity.</P>
<P>What influence the French have had among the multitude will appear from two circum&s;tances (I could mention a thou&s;and) fre&s;h in every ones mind. At the town-meeting at New York, called to con|demn the treaty, the people marched under the banners of France and America. The&s;e flags were carried at the head of the vile and in&s;olent proce&s;|&s;ion that proceeded to the governor's hou&s;e, and there burnt the treaty. The other fact is of &s;till more recent date, and &s;till more &s;triking. The petition, &s;aid to be &s;igned by fifteen hundred <HI>citi|zens</HI> of Philadelphia, again&s;t the treaty, and now before the Hou&s;e, was carried round for &s;ignature by a <HI>Frenchman.</HI> The <HI>chairman</HI> of the meeting was al&s;o a <HI>Frenchman;</HI> nor am I &s;ure that it was not originally drawn up in the <HI>French language.</HI> I wonder what the people of England, or, indeed, of
<PB N="146" REF="030221_0078_0FE52971855C4C98">
any independant nation, would &s;ay to a foreigner, who &s;hould carry round for their &s;ignature, a petition again&s;t the execution of a "law of the land;" a &s;olemn contract entered into between them and another nation? There is a certain point of deba&s;e|ment, below which no nation can &s;ink, whether this be that point, or not, I will not at pre&s;ent take upon me to &s;ay; God only knows what he has yet in re&s;erve for us.</P>
<P>I am aware, it will be &s;aid here; that, though the chairman, under who&s;e authority and direction this petition was drawn up, was a <HI>Frenchman,</HI> yet it was pre&s;ented to the Hou&s;e by an <HI>Engli&s;hman,</HI> or, to &s;peak more correctly, an <HI>Homuncio,</HI> born in En|gland. But, let it be recollected that this <HI>Homuncio</HI> has, &s;ince the beginning of the pre&s;ent war, been a mo&s;t de&s;perate &s;upporter of the cau&s;e of the French; that he trades to France, and to France principally, and that the whole of his political career ju&s;tifies the name of <HI>Engli&s;h Jacobin.</HI></P>
<P>The reader, from what has been &s;aid of this di|minutive mortal, will at once perceive that I am &s;peaking of <HI>Mr. Swanwick,</HI> one of the augu&s;t re|pre&s;entatives of the City of Philadelphia. I have been told, that this gentleman has taken upon him to pronounce me a hired <HI>Engli&s;h &s;cribbler.</HI> I will not tell this <HI>omicciuolo</HI> (for the <HI>Italian</HI> diminutive &s;uits him be&s;t on every account) what I am; but I will tell him what I am not.&mdash;I am not de&s;cended from the dregs of the King of Great Britain's Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e; I was never fed from the &s;craps of His Maje&s;ties bounty, collected by an hone&s;t &s;py, called <HI>a Tide-Waiter.</HI> I never &s;napped at the hand that gave me bread, and nouri&s;hed the &s;treams from which I drew my life. I am the ba&s;e and
<PB N="147" REF="030221_0079_0FE528D8066EAEC8">
cringing flatterer of no man, much le&s;s of the men I de&s;pi&s;e. I never wrote to England an enumera|tion of my <HI>titles,</HI> outnumbering tho&s;e of a Spani&s;h Hidalgo, and concluding with, <Q>Pre&s;ident of the Emigration &s;ociety, Trea&s;urer of the Dancing-A&s;&s;embly, and Tru&s;tee of the Young Ladies School.</Q> At the age of <HI>thirty eight,</HI> in the prime of life, I never decorated my bed-chamber with la&s;civious pictures, <HI>Leda and her Swan,</HI> and &s;uch like &s;timulu&s;es. One who is obliged to have recour&s;e to the&s;e mi&s;erable &s;hifts is unworthy even of the name <HI>omicciuollo.</HI></P>
<P>After having thus candidly given an account of my&s;elf, let me a&s;k you, <HI>Mr. Swanwick,</HI> a que&s;tion or two.&mdash;How came you to imagine your&s;elf ble&s;&s;ed with the <HI>aura divina?</HI> how came you to imagine, that the <HI>Mu&s;es,</HI> who are of the female &s;ex, had ever ca&s;t a favourable eye on you? be&s;ides, if you mu&s;t commit your mi&s;erable doggerel to paper, why &s;end it to England for impre&s;&s;ion? why take &s;uch incredible pains to in&s;ure its appearance in an Engli&s;h Magazine? why did you not &s;end it to your new country, France? can it be po&s;&s;ible that you yet wi&s;h to &s;hine among the countrymen of your ance&s;tors? I will wear the &s;hine off you, as &s;ure as you and I live.&mdash;As to the piece I here al|lude to, I have not room, at pre&s;ent, to lay it be|fore my readers; but I will ju&s;t a&s;k, how you came to di&s;cover, that <HI>Earth</HI> is to <HI>become</HI> the <HI>proto-type of Heaven?</HI></P>
<Q><L>"So &s;hall the year to harmony be given,</L>

to &s;leep with your own <HI>canzones,</HI> yet I pre&s;ume it will never be found that earth is the <HI>proto-type</HI> of heaven; the <HI>proto-type</HI> of &s;omething that exi&s;ted <HI>be|fore it,</HI> and which it is to <HI>re&s;emble.</HI>&mdash;As &s;oon as there is a vacancy in your Young Ladies' Acade|my, I advi&s;e you to fill it your&s;elf, and to let poe|try and politics alone.</P>
<P>It is ju&s;t matter of &s;urprize that this gentleman &s;hould be elected the repre&s;entative of &s;uch a city as Philadelphia. The arts by which his election was brought about I re&s;erve as the &s;ubject of an article in a future Cen&s;or. I have heard of a &s;turdy young Lord in England, who got him&s;elf elected through the intere&s;t of the wives and daughters of his con|&s;tituents; Mr. Swanwick will never be &s;u&s;pected of <HI>this kind</HI> of <HI>corruption;</HI> but whether he ought to be &s;u&s;pected of no other kind, is more than I will pre|tend to determine. Grog is cheap, and its influ|ence is mighty.</P>
<P>After this long and rambling digre&s;&s;ion, I return to the &s;ubject of French influence, and I am per|&s;uaded that the reader mu&s;t agree with me, that, after the Virginia Debts, it has been the principal cau&s;e of oppo&s;ition to the Briti&s;h treaty.</P>
<P>However, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that the&s;e cau&s;es, powerful as they have been, would have produced but a partial effect, had they not been aided by the delu&s;ion of the great body of the people with re|&s;pect to the &s;ituation of Great Britain. The ran|cour they entertained again&s;t that nation laid them open to the fal&s;hoods which the friends of France, among whom we may reckon nearly all the News-Printers, &s;o indu&s;triou&s;ly &s;pread through the coun|try. A hundred times Great Britain has been re|pre&s;ented
<PB N="149" REF="030221_0081_0FE5299ECFC07C68">
as on the brink of ruin. The editor of the Philadelphia Gazette opened the new-year, 1795, with congratulating his cu&s;tomers on the &s;tability and vigour of the Federal Government, while that of Great Britain was ju&s;t crumbling to pieces. In the &s;ame paper, he called the I&s;land of Britain <HI>"an in&s;ular Ba&s;tile."</HI>&mdash;When intelligence was received of the progre&s;s the French were mak|ing in Holland, the papers announced it as an event that mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be the immediate cau&s;e of the total overthrow of the Briti&s;h nation. <Q>The taking of Am&s;terdam," &s;aid the papers, "is the la&s;t blow to the power of Britain.</Q> Bets were laid that Great Britain would become an appendage of the French Republic; and more than once were we informed by the public papers, that the tricolor|ed flag was flying on St. James's Palace.</P>
<P>Gro&s;s as the&s;e impo&s;itions were, they were gree|dily &s;wallowed by the people, nine tenths of whom believed every a&s;&s;ertion of the kind that was made. Men are apt to believe what they wi&s;h; it is hard to convince them, that tho&s;e whom they hate are objects of envy and re&s;pect. Such was the gene|ral opinion of the di&s;tre&s;&s;es and weakne&s;s of Great Britain, and &s;uch the per&s;ua&s;ion that her &s;ituation would oblige her to yield to any thing that Mr. Jay &s;hould dictate, that, when intelligence was re|ceived of the conclu&s;ion of the treaty, <HI>Pichegru</HI> was toa&s;ted as the <HI>negociator.</HI></P>
<P>A circum&s;tance like this, though de&s;picable in it&s;elf, proves that an opinion was entertained, that His Britannic Maje&s;ty had been <HI>forced,</HI> by the &s;uc|ce&s;&s;es of the French, to accept of &s;uch terms as Mr. Jay cho&s;e to offer, and, of cour&s;e, a treaty was expected, at once humiliating to Great Britain
<PB N="150" REF="030221_0082_0FE5294132968BD8">
and honourable as well as advantageous to the United States. Nothing equal to the&s;e lofty ex|pectations was to be found in the treaty. It was a di&s;appointment; and di&s;appointment ever di&s;po&s;es men to di&s;content. In vain were the people told, that they had been deceived with re&s;pect to the &s;tate of Great Britain: in vain was it hinted to them, that &s;he would finally be &s;ucce&s;sful in the war: their hatred and the continued chain of fal&s;|hood running through the public papers, had ren|dered them deaf to the voice of rea&s;on and of truth. The Southern Debtors and French Emi&s;&s;aries took advantage of this prevalent delu&s;ion, and the op|po&s;ition became almo&s;t univer&s;al.</P>
<P>There were not wanting men of talents to add fuel to the flame, nor were there wanting others, actuated by a &s;incere love of their country, who endeavoured to counter-act &s;uch baleful efforts. It is certainly owing to the writings of the&s;e gentle|men, that the people have latterly begun to form a right judgment of this important treaty, and to rally round that government on which their very exi&s;tence as an independant nation depends. The judges, too, in the middle and nothern States, have exerted a laudable zeal; &s;ome of the public papers have &s;tood forth in the cau&s;e of order and truth; and there is not the lea&s;t doubt, that the treaty would have met with no oppo&s;ition in the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives, had not the members been cho&s;en, while the public mind was at the height of its fermentation. This was unfortunate|ly the ca&s;e: <HI>treaty,</HI> and <HI>no treaty,</HI> were the &s;ignals at the elections; and as the oppo&s;ers were the mo&s;t numerous, &s;o are the members of the oppo&s;ition.</P>
<P><PB N="151" REF="030221_0083_0FE528E24563BED8">Thus is this oppo&s;ition bottomed on <HI>di&s;hone&s;ty, corruption,</HI> or <HI>ignorance,</HI> and, probably, on all three together. That it may be fru&s;trated is my &s;incere wi&s;h, and that it will I have not the lea&s;t doubt: I cannot bring my&s;elf to imagine, that the people of this country will tamely &s;uffer them&s;elves to be hurled from the pinnacle of national pro&s;pe|rity into the horrid aby&s;s of foreign and civil war, of anarchy, requi&s;itions and ma&s;&s;acre, by a band of intere&s;ted and de&s;perate leaders, who have nothing to lo&s;e but the po&s;ts which their too credulous con&s;tituents have be&s;towed on them. I have not the lea&s;t doubt that the nefarious con&s;piration will be finally rendered abortive, and that the French gold, now in circulation, will be as ineffectual as that formerly di&s;tributed among the <Q>pretended patriots of America;</Q> but, while there is a po&s;|&s;ibility of the contrary, the attention of the people ought to be directed to the dangers that await them. I &s;hall point out the&s;e dangers as they pre&s;ent them|&s;elves to me: if the reader &s;hould think them ima|ginary, he may do well to treat them like other efforts of imagination; but, if he has the lea&s;t rea|&s;on to think them real, it is certainly his duty to en|deavour to avert them by every exertion in his power.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t thing that pre&s;ents it&s;elf among the con|&s;equences of annulling the treaty, is, the detention of the We&s;tern Po&s;ts by the Briti&s;h. The not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing of the&s;e po&s;ts has latterly co&s;t the people of this country about a million of dollars annually, be&s;ides the lo&s;s of lives; be&s;ides defeats and conti|nual di&s;contents. The po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of them mu&s;t, then, be a de&s;irable object. But, &s;ay the enemies of the treaty, they ought to have been given up
<PB N="152" REF="030221_0084_0FE52942D0218FF8">
long ago, unconditionally. I have proved the con|trary, and I could repeat my proofs, but this is now totally out of the que&s;tion: we know they were not given up, that they are not yet given up, and we may be a&s;&s;ured that they will not be given up, un|le&s;s the pre&s;ent treaty is carried into effect.</P>
<P>But, it is &s;aid, that the Briti&s;h are bound by the treaty to give up the po&s;ts on the 1&s;t of June, and that they ought to fulfill this part of their en|gagements, without paying any attention to what is doing in Congre&s;s; that they have no bu&s;ine&s;s with our internal di&s;putes, the treaty being the only rule for their conduct; and, with this doctrine in hand, it is &s;uppo&s;ed, that &s;ome members of the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives mean to delay their deci&s;ion on the &s;ubject till after the fir&s;t of June; and if the po&s;ts are not evacuated at that time, to accu&s;e the Brit|i&s;h of annulling the treaty. To this I an&s;wer: that I am fully per&s;uaded, that the Governor of Cana|da will retain the po&s;ts, till the treaty has been &s;anc|tioned by an appropriation law; and that I am ful|ly convinced he would be ju&s;tified in &s;o doing. This nation formed a certain con&s;titution, or manner of government, which they promulgated to the world; in this con&s;titution it is &s;aid, that treaties, made and ratified by the Pre&s;ident and Senate, <HI>&s;hall be &s;upreme laws of the land.</HI> Per&s;uaded that the nati|on would abide by this its &s;olemn declaration, &s;eve|ral powers made treaties with the Pre&s;ident and Se|nate, and, among others, Great Britain; but before the time for fulfilling a certain &s;tipulation in the treaty with Great Britain is arrived, it becomes matter of doubt, whether this treaty be valid or not; or rather, one branch of the American go|vernment declares it invalid, by a re&s;olution entered on its journals. Under &s;uch circum&s;tances, will
<PB N="153" REF="030221_0085_0FE528E44E2A4C08">
common rea&s;on or common &s;en&s;e deny, that the Briti&s;h would be ju&s;tifiable in refu&s;ing to fulfill their part of the &s;tipulations?</P>
<P>I have &s;aid, that Mr. Blount's re&s;olution declares the treaty <HI>invalid.</HI> The word invalid is not made u&s;e of but we &s;hall &s;oon &s;ee that the re&s;olution goes to the full length. The Hou&s;e, by adopting it, have formally and explicitly declared, that a treaty including commercial regulations, is not binding on the United States, till &s;anctioned by the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives. The pre&s;ent treaty includes commercial regulations, and therefore is <HI>not binding on the United States.</HI> The Hou&s;e have al&s;o declared in this re&s;olution, that treaties including commercial regulations require the &s;anction of the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives before they can be effectual; or, in other words, that the ratification of the Pre&s;ident and Senate is <HI>not &s;ufficient to give &s;uch treaties their full and entire effect.</HI> The pre&s;ent treaty was, then, concluded and ratified by per&s;ons not fully empow|ered &s;o to do.</P>
<P>Now, the fir&s;t principles, touching treaties, are; that, to be valid, <HI>the parties mu&s;t have full power to conclude, ratify, and carry into effect;</HI> and that, the covenant mu&s;t be <HI>equally binding and obligatory on both parties.</HI> The Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives have declared, that the pre&s;ent treaty fails in both the&s;e points; they declare it invalid, and the Briti&s;h will certainly be permitted to believe them. Upon this ground it is, that, &s;hould the Governor of Canada deliver the po&s;ts, before the Hou&s;e has &s;anctioned the treaty, he would de&s;erve to lo&s;e his head.</P>
<P>I will ju&s;t &s;top here to ob&s;erve; that, I dare &s;ay, it never entered into the heads of the wi&s;e Oppo&s;i|tion,
<PB N="154" REF="030221_0086_0FE5294453D76050">
that Billy Pitt may, perhaps, play them a trick. Suppo&s;e he could gull the <HI>five</HI> &s;ans-culotte kings with Canada, in exchange for St. Domingo? the <HI>Po&s;ts</HI> would go into the bargain, of cour&s;e, and then we &s;hould have to di&s;pute with our own dear kindred republicans for them. Take care, gentle|men; now or never is the time to have them, take my word for it.</P>
<P>The treaty being invalid, all the other &s;tipulations as well as that re&s;pecting the po&s;ts, will a&s;&s;uredly remain unfulfilled. The revi&s;al of the &s;entences given in the courts of Vice Admiralty, and the appointment of commi&s;&s;ioners for examining ap|peals, &amp;c. will not take place; the con&s;equence of which will be, the merchants of this country will lo&s;e about five or &s;ix millions of dollars. Indeed, Mr. Living&s;ton, with a view of &s;ilencing the&s;e peo|ple, has brought forward a re&s;olution for paying the&s;e few millions out of the trea&s;ury of the United States. All the difference in this ca&s;e will be, that the lo&s;s will be divided among us all; the hard|working pea&s;ant and mechanic will be obliged to contribute towards an indemnification for a lo&s;s, incurred by adventurers and &s;peculators.</P>
<P>Things will remain, then, with re&s;pect to Great Britain, ju&s;t as they were before Mr. Jay went to England; we mu&s;t, therefore, bring our&s;elves back to that epoch, and &s;et out afre&s;h.</P>
<P>The &s;ame alternative pre&s;ents it&s;elf: a negociation or war. The Pre&s;ident would prefer a negociation? but, can any one &s;uppo&s;e, that he will ever enter into another? I &s;hall, however, for a moment, ad|mit this to be po&s;&s;ible. I &s;hall &s;uppo&s;e him content to give up his adherence to the con&s;titution, to receive

Can it be po&s;&s;ible that the Americans are &s;o poor in talents, &s;o deba&s;ed in principle, as to entru&s;t their public affairs to an European adventurer, the leader of an in&s;urrection! Can the&s;e people be &s;o degenerated. I blu&s;h to think them the offspring of Britons. Ble&s;&s;ed for ever be the laws of Old England, that exclude all foreigners from public offices. The&s;e wretches are now tearing the government of America to pie|ces, as the &s;ubtle and intriguing <HI>Neckar</HI> did that of France. They join them&s;elves to the re&s;tle&s;s rabble of every country, flatter their pa&s;&s;ions and prejudi|ces, make war upon the rich, divide the &s;poil, and then retire to their own country to devour it.</P>
</SP>
<P>I do not pretend to &s;ay, that the interview would be conducted exactly thus; but I am certain as to its re&s;ult. I am certain that every offer to treat would be rejected with di&s;dain. War, then, mu&s;t be re&s;orted to: not that war is the nece&s;&s;ary con&s;e|quence of the violation of a treaty; but with the accumulated load of griefs and in&s;ults on both &s;ides, and the irreconcileable hatred exi&s;ting in this coun|try
<PB N="158" REF="030221_0091_0FE528B634301B80">
again&s;t Great Britain, it is morally impo&s;&s;ible to pre&s;erve peace.</P>
<P>The Pre&s;ident and Senate are oppo&s;ed to war; they know well its con&s;equences to this country; but, who can tell what the Pre&s;ident of next year may be? Can any man po&s;&s;ibly hope, that General Wa&s;hington will &s;uffer him&s;elf to be degraded by remaining the pageant, the mere tool of a faithle&s;s and profligate faction. The reputation he has gain|ed, it is not in the power of hell to wre&s;t from him; hitherto he has been &s;uffered to keep in the path of honour; but, one &s;ingle &s;tep in the directi|on he is now required to tread, and his renown is bla&s;ted for ever. No; if this treaty does not go into effect, it cannot be expected, it cannot be hoped, that he will again accept the po&s;t of Pre&s;i|dent. Nor will any other man accept of it, who is attached to the pre&s;ent con&s;titution. Some more pliant mortal mu&s;t, then, be found; &s;ome pro&s;ti|tuted friend of France, ready to &s;acrifice the inter|e&s;ts of this country to the wild and bloody princi|ples of the Convention. With &s;uch a Pre&s;ident, and with &s;uch a majority in the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;en|tatives, war with Britain would be inevitable.</P>
<P>War is at all times and to all countries dreadful in its effects, but to no country and at no time was it ever &s;o dreadful as it would now be to America. This is not a warlike nation, nor has this nation a warlike government. In a war with any nation whatever, this country can gain nothing, and in a war with Great Britain it has every thing to lo&s;e.</P>
<P>When a&s;&s;ertions like the&s;e are advanced, the ad|vocates for war turn, with imaginary triumph, to
<PB N="159" REF="030221_0092_0FE528E5D18390F8">
the re&s;ult of the la&s;t war. They tell us, that Ame|rica was victorious, and that the country is now much more populous and rich than it was then.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, what did this country <HI>gain</HI> by the la&s;t war? If <HI>independence</HI> was a <HI>gain</HI> (for <HI>at pre|&s;ent</HI> that is very problematical) it was the only gain, I &s;hall not dwell on the <HI>lo&s;&s;es;</HI> tho&s;e who have had their hou&s;es burnt about their ears; tho&s;e who have been pillaged, plundered robbed of their property; tho&s;e who are now &s;tarving with bundles of continental money under their roofs; tho&s;e who have lo&s;t their children or their parents, do not need to be re|minded of the lo&s;&s;es of that war. If <HI>independence</HI> was the <HI>only gain</HI> of la&s;t war, what is to be the gain of another? The <HI>warriors</HI> do not pretend, that we could go and take Great Britain: they do not pre|tend that we could take Jamaica: they do not pre|tend even that we could take Bermuda. What then can we take? Why&mdash;<HI>Canada.</HI> This is the burthen of their &s;ong, or rather <HI>war-hoop.</HI> With this they divert the rabble, and &s;harpen their fangs for war and conque&s;t. If you a&s;k them <HI>how</HI> they would do this, they tell you that <HI>men</HI> are not want|ing; that <HI>four hundred thou&s;and</HI> would turn out volunteer again&s;t Great Britain. I believe twice that number would turn out for a field-day, with &s;ticks and &s;taves, and return very peaceably home to &s;upper; but would they do this two days run|ning? If I am to judge from experience; from the infinite difficulty the government had to a&s;&s;emble &s;o trifling a force as fifteen thou&s;and men on a re|cent occa&s;ion, I &s;hould reduce this army of four hundred thou&s;and men to three or four battalions. I &s;hall be told, that the &s;entiments of the people concerning the <HI>exci&s;e</HI> were divided; and are they unan|imous concerning the treaty? I will however &s;uppo&s;e the people to have but one &s;entiment; I will &s;uppo&s;e
<PB N="160" REF="030221_0093_0FE5295185D83358">
<HI>one</HI> hundred thou&s;and men ready to &s;ubmit them|&s;elves to all the rigour of military di&s;cipline, and all the hard&s;hips in&s;eparable from actual &s;ervice; I will &s;uppo&s;e them all heroes, ready to <Q>&s;eek the bubble honour in the cannon's mouth;</Q> and I will &s;uppo&s;e a Wa&s;hington at their head. Yet, the&s;e heroes mu&s;t eat, and mu&s;t have &s;ome kind of covering too, and this will co&s;t money. In &s;hort, I have made a little calculation of the expence of <HI>fifty</HI> thou&s;and men, <HI>ten</HI> armed ve&s;&s;els, <HI>ten</HI> galleys, with all the nece&s;&s;ary officers, hor&s;es, waggons, cannon, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. and I find the amount to be above <HI>twenty millions of dollars</HI> annually, a &s;um three times as great as the <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> revenue of the United States. Can any &s;ober man look at this, and imagine this country fit to engage in a war? There is not &s;pecie in the country &s;ufficient to car|ry on the war one month. As to loans, where are they to be obtained? in France, or in Holland? the very mention of tho&s;e countries, on &s;uch a &s;ubject, excites laughter. Dome&s;tic loans; who will lend a &s;ixpence? Taxes? there will be no|thing but hou&s;es and land to tax. Commerce will be no more. The enemy will let nothing out of our ports, or into them. In a word, it is ab&s;olute|ly impo&s;&s;ible for this country to equip any thing like a creditable force, without having recour&s;e to a <HI>paper currency and requi&s;itions.</HI> I care not who dif|fers from me in opinion, this opinion I give as my own, and, if war is declared, I &s;hall &s;ee it verified.</P>
<P>As <HI>doing injury to Great Britain</HI> is the &s;tronge&s;t &s;timulus to war in this country, I &s;hall now take a view of the extent of that injury in the pre&s;ent in|&s;tance. As to the taking of Canada, I do not be|lieve it probable. There are men in that country
<PB N="161" REF="030221_0094_0FE528B929FF5BA8">
as well as this, and they are better men, too, if we believe tho&s;e deba&s;ed wretches, who tell us, that one frenchman is worth three of their own an|ce&s;tors. At any rate they are men, they are at home, they have eight or nine regular regiments, and a train of artillery, &s;uch as this country will not have in fifty years to come, Engineers and other experienced officers. When the <HI>warriors</HI> talk about taking Canada, they forget that there is any body to defend it. To be &s;ure the poor de|vils are <HI>&s;ubjects;</HI> but as they might get together twice the number of the <HI>citizens</HI> marched again&s;t them, there is a po&s;&s;ibility, at lea&s;t, that they might lay &s;ome few of the latter dead upon the field.</P>
<P>By &s;ea, a war with this country would not add a dollar to the expences of Great Britain. She is already armed, and can very well &s;pare a &s;tout &s;quadron for this coa&s;t. How this &s;quadron <HI>might be employed</HI> I &s;hall not point out; &s;uffice it to &s;ay, that, if doing <HI>injury</HI> &s;hould be the object of the Briti&s;h Court, more could be done to us in one week, than we could do to Great Britain in ten years.</P>
<P>But, we &s;hould &s;tarve their i&s;lands: no &s;uch thing. He who is ma&s;ter of the &s;ea, may call him|&s;elf the ma&s;ter of the land. Tho&s;e who have pro|duce to &s;ell, will &s;ell it, in &s;pite of decrees and ordinances. The Briti&s;h would obtain all they wanted, ju&s;t as they now do, with this advantage, that they would prevent their enemies from doing the &s;ame. The more I contemplate this &s;ubject, the more I am convinced, that a war with Ameri|ca would be favourable to the cau&s;e in which Great Britain is at pre&s;ent engaged.</P>
<P><PB N="162" REF="030221_0095_0FE5295307D5CC60">Another rea&s;on for going to war, is; we &s;hould <HI>injure</HI> (always <HI>injure</HI>) the manufacturers in Great Britain; to which I beg may be added, we &s;hould leave our&s;elves naked. This latter may be a de&s;ir|able object with the <HI>&s;ans-culottes,</HI> though I &s;hould hardly imagine that Mr. <HI>Swanwick</HI> would much approve of it. People vainly &s;uppo&s;e that the very exi&s;tence of Great Britain depends on her com|merce with this country: experience might have taught us the contrary: &s;he can do without our trade for a dozen years at a time. Nor would &s;uch a contraction of her commerce at the pre&s;ent time, and <HI>in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e,</HI> cau&s;e any di&s;content in that country. Our behaviour would unite the nation, and the Engli&s;hman that would not patient|ly bear a temporary inconvenience or di&s;tre&s;s, that would not even &s;pend his la&s;t &s;hilling, to enable his king to revenge &s;uch an abominable trait of perfidy as the annulling of this treaty, ought to be &s;tripped to his &s;kin, nay of his &s;kin into the bargain. The fact is, that, be&s;ides wanting the aid of France, this country would al&s;o want the aid of the Engli&s;h in this war: and this would be one of the great differences between this war and the la&s;t. La&s;t war, addre&s;&s;es to the people of England did much: &s;ome of tho&s;e who came to fight for the king, took very good care to fight again&s;t him: &s;oldiers and &s;ailors came to de&s;ert to their <HI>brothers,</HI> who were combatting in a cau&s;e, which was pretty generally looked upon as the cau&s;e of Britons. Things are now changed. <HI>Doctor Franklin,</HI> were he to ri&s;e from the dead, would not now be heard at the bar of the Hou&s;e of Lords. No Engli&s;h Lords, <HI>after the fate of Lord Chatham's &s;tatue</HI> at Charle&s;ton, will ever take upon him the cau&s;e of this country; un|le&s;s, indeed, it be the Earl of Stanhope, who <HI>wi&s;hes

to be hanged.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Such was really the fate of Lord Chatham's &s;tatue at Charle&s;ton, in the &s;pring of 1794. Mr. <HI>William Pitt's</HI> Effigy was burnt in the &s;ame town, and on the &s;ame day.</NOTE> <HI>Doctor Prie&s;tley</HI> we have the happi|ne&s;s to have among us, and therefore he can do his country no more harm. No; if we are to have war, let us come forward boldly like republicans, and tell the Briti&s;h we abhor and dete&s;t them. No wheedling, no coaxing. Let tho&s;e who have burnt that nation's flag, and called for all the thunder bolts in the &s;tores of heaven to be hurled on them, expect from them all the mi&s;chief they can po&s;&s;i|bly do.</P>
<P>I know, that &s;uch language as this is unu&s;ual in this country. It would be much more plea&s;ing to dwell on the power of the United States and the decrepid &s;tate of Great Britain; but I am no can|didate for popular favour or applau&s;e. I delight in &s;peaking hard truths; and be&s;ides, this is not the time for je&s;ting or flattery.</P>
<P>I have hitherto proceeded upon the &s;uppo&s;ition, that the people of this country would be all unit|ed in the cau&s;e of the war. But, how far would this be from the ca&s;e! almo&s;t all the rich, almo&s;t all the people of property, would be oppo&s;ed to it. There is another and &s;till more dangerous kind of divi&s;ion, which would finally end in a di&s;&s;oluti|on of the Union: I mean the divi&s;ion of the North from the South. The enemies of peace, in the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives, are, with two honoura|ble exceptions, to be found almo&s;t &s;olely in the &s;outhern States. Can it be imagined, that the ho|ne&s;t and indu&s;trious people of the north will &s;uf|fer them&s;elves to be dragged down to perdition, merely to &s;atisfy the unprincipled vengeance of a
<PB N="164" REF="030221_0097_0FE528E7535B0848">
ne&s;t of fraudulent debtors? Can it be imagined, that the New Englanders will tamely &s;uffer the <HI>lords</HI> of Virginia to &s;port with their pro&s;perity and happine&s;s, as they do with their barrels of rice and tobacco at a cock-match? Common &s;en&s;e forbids us to believe any &s;uch thing.</P>
<P>I have &s;uppo&s;ed al&s;o, that the government would retain its pre&s;ent form; but, can this po&s;&s;ibly be &s;o? No; the moment a war &s;hould be declared, in con&s;equence of the rejection of the treaty, the con&s;titution would be thrown a&s;ide as u&s;ele&s;s lum|ber. A revolutionary &s;tate mu&s;t &s;ucceed. Then our Bri&s;&s;ots and our Robe&s;pierres would mount the throne: we have them ready at hand, and a war is all that is wanting to bring them forth. We &s;hould have our <HI>ari&s;tocrats;</HI> indeed, they are already pointed out: the erection of a guillotine is all that remains for the <HI>patriots</HI> to do, preparatory to their execution. In &s;hort, do we envy the French their &s;ituation, or do we not? Do we wi&s;h to experience tho&s;e &s;ufferings, at the recital of which we now weep? Do we wi&s;h to witne&s;s all tho&s;e cruelties, tho&s;e frightful horrors, that freeze the blood and make us a&s;hamed of our &s;pecies? If we do, a war, at the pre&s;ent moment, will infallibly bring us the object of our wi&s;hes, and we &s;hall do well to &s;econd the endeavours of the Living&s;tons, the Madi&s;ons and the Gallatins.</P>
<P>I am per&s;uaded, that the following letter, from my <HI>Cou&s;in Hedge-hog</HI> at New York, will not be unacceptable to my readers.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>New York,</HI>
<DATE>21&s;t <HI>April,</HI> 1796.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>DEAR COUSIN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I have long been a con&s;tant reader of your u&s;e|ful works, and, as belonging to a branch of your family, I have taken to my&s;elf &s;ome part of the honour which their boldne&s;s and evident object re|flect on the author; but, as my branch is a young|er, or &s;ubaltern one, and as I have not had the folly to adopt the levelling principles of the &s;ans-culottes of the pre&s;ent day, I have not 'till now pre&s;umed to intrude on your time, nor &s;hould I have done it at all, had not the Democratic tricks in this city &s;eemed to call aloud for publicity.</P>
<P>Without further apology, then, I take the liber|ty to inform you; that, ye&s;terday, an a&s;&s;embly was held in the Bridewel-Fields (they were, you &s;ee, on their own dunghill) to re-damn the treaty, or, in other words to decide on a <HI>petition</HI> to <HI>order</HI> the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives not to pa&s;s the laws nece&s;&s;ary for carrying it into effect. As all the merchants, and other inhabitants of credit and con|&s;equence, had before &s;igned a petition to a contrary effect, you will ea&s;ily &s;uppo&s;e of whom this Bride|wel meeting was compo&s;ed. The hour was, 12 o'clock, when <HI>labourers</HI> of every de&s;cription were at lei&s;ure to attend. P. R. Liv&mdash;ton and M. Liv&mdash;ton (<HI>worthy</HI> relations of our <HI>nominal</HI> repre&s;entative) were the leading orators. After the&s;e came their coadjutor, Francis Van D&mdash;ke, a chocolate grinder, known only for his &s;tupid head, his rancourous heart, his &s;our phiz and the ridiculous bu&s;tle he made about the <HI>tricolored flag,</HI> that &s;ome wag had the liberticide impudence to tear down from the place where it was hoi&s;ted in our Coffee-Hou&s;e. This man was <HI>chairman</HI> of the meeting. The next ora|tor was Serj&mdash;t Cl&mdash;ke, &s;o con&s;e&s;&s;edly in the pay
<PB N="167" REF="030221_0099_0FE529A7ED3DDD08">
of France, that he once actually &s;ued G&mdash;net for not paying his <HI>&s;ecret &s;ervices</HI> according to &s;tipulated agreement. This "pretended patriot," previous to the meeting, advertized for the purpo&s;e of pur|cha&s;ing <Q>&s;everal thou&s;and of hoop-poles, to be u&s;ed as <HI>junkets (alias</HI> bludgeons) on the day of parade.</Q></P>
<P>The complexion of the meeting was &s;uch, that, it is &s;aid, even the Liv&mdash;tons <HI>blu&s;hed</HI> at it. This, however, nobody, that knows the thickne&s;s of their &s;kin, will believe. A petition was drawn up; but, as the a&s;&s;i&s;tants could not be &s;uppo&s;ed capable of &s;igning their names, and, as in making their marks they mu&s;t have rendered the paper as &s;ooty as their own paws, a committee was appointed to &s;ign for them, though the paws of this committee are cer|tainly not much <HI>cleaner</HI> than tho&s;e of the a&s;&s;embly in general.</P>
<P>What effect &s;uch a petition as this may have I know not: the &s;apient heads of the Oppo&s;ition &s;eem to be turned; but they may re&s;t a&s;&s;ured, that, if they have <HI>&s;old</HI> us to France, the bargain will not&s;tand. They object to our treaty with Britain, becau&s;e contracted without their con&s;ent, and we &s;hall object to their treaty with France, becau&s;e contracted without our con&s;ent. This is fighting them at their own weapons.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t now call your attention to another event. On the 12th in&s;tant, one <HI>Kettlatas,</HI> who&s;e offence was that of <HI>vilifying the a&s;&s;embly of the State,</HI> was &s;et at liberty, and drawn in triumph through the &s;treets, &s;eated in an old ragged Pheaton, by the Guards of the city; I mean the Black-Guards.
<PB N="168" REF="030221_0100_0FE529C319FB13C8">
On this joyful occa&s;ion there was a &s;ort of civic-fe|&s;tival. The French <HI>hulks,</HI> now lying in our har|bour (where they have lain for nine months pa&s;t, and where they will lie while there is an Engli&s;h armed &s;hip at &s;ea) decorated them&s;elves in all their &s;ans-culotte parafarnalia, u&s;ually exhibited at the triumph of &s;avage anarchy over order and law.</P>
<P>Thus you &s;ee the clo&s;e connection that every where exi&s;ts between the French and the brutal enemies of our governments. The&s;e are in&s;ults that no government ever before put up with; in|&s;ults, I tru&s;t, we &s;hall not long &s;uffer with im|punity.</P>

<P>P. S. Unfortunately, your intelligence, in the la&s;t <HI>Cen&s;or,</HI> concerning our malicious Argus (as far as relates to his decea&s;e) was not well founded.
