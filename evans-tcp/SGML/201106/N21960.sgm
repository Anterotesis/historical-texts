<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>heart is deceitful above all things; who can know it?</HI> As far as I know my own, it feels an anxious de&s;ire to &s;erve my fellow-creatures, during the &s;hort period of my continuance among them, by &s;topping the effu|&s;ion of human blood, by dimini&s;hing or &s;often|ing the mi&s;eries which man creates for him&s;elf, by promoting peace and by endeavoring to &s;ecure and extend civil liberty.</P>
<P>I attribute war, and mo&s;t of the artificial evils of life, to the <HI>Spirit of De&s;poti&s;m,</HI> a rank poi&s;onous weed, which grows and flouri&s;hes even in the &s;oil of liberty, when over-run with corruption. I have attempted to eradicate it, that the &s;alutary and plea&s;ant plants may have room to &s;trike root and expand their foliage.</P>
<P>There is one circum&s;tance which induces me to think that, in this in&s;tance, my heart does not deceive me. I am certain, that in attempt|ing to promote the general happine&s;s of man, without &s;erving any party, or paying court to any individual, I am not &s;tudying my own intere&s;t. On the contrary, I am well aware that my very &s;ubject mu&s;t give offence to tho&s;e who are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of power and patronage. I have no per&s;onal enmities, and therefore am truly concerned that I could not treat the
<PB N="iv" REF="028936_0003_0FDD5F1A6B255578">Spirit of De&s;poti&s;m, without advancing opini|ons that mu&s;t di&s;plea&s;e the <HI>nominal great.</HI> I certainly &s;acrifice all view of per&s;onal advantage to what appears to me the public good; and flatter my&s;elf that this alone evinces the purity of my motive.</P>
<P>Men of feeling and good minds, who&s;e hearts, as the phra&s;e is, lie in the right place, will, I think, agree with me in mo&s;t points; e&s;pecially when a little time, and the events, now taking place, &s;hall have di&s;&s;ipated the mi&s;t of pa&s;&s;ion and prejudice. Hard-hearted, proud worldlings, who love them&s;elves only, and know no good but money and pageantry, will &s;carcely agree with me in any. They will be angry; but, con&s;i&s;tently with their general haughtine&s;s, affect contempt to hide their choler.</P>
<P>I pretend not to a&s;pire at the honor of mar|tyrdom: yet &s;ome inconveniences I am ready to bear patiently, in promoting a cau&s;e which deeply concerns the whole of the pre&s;ent race, and ages yet unborn. I am ready to bear pati|ently the proud man's contumely, the in&s;ult of rude ignorance, the &s;arca&s;m of malice, the hired cen&s;ure of the &s;ycophantic critic, (who&s;e preferment depends on the pro&s;titution both of knowledge and con&s;cience,) and the viru|lence of the venal new&s;paper. It would be a di&s;grace to an hone&s;t man not to incur the abu&s;e of tho&s;e who have &s;old their integrity and abi|lities to the enemies of their country and the human race. <HI>Strike, but hear,</HI> &s;aid a noble ancient. Truth will ultimately prevail, even
<PB N="v" REF="028936_0004_0FDD5F8373B8A960">though he who uttered i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;hould be de&s;troyed. Columbus was de&s;pi&s;ed, rejected, per&s;ecuted; but America was di&s;covered. Men very incon|&s;iderable in the eye of pride, have had the honor to di&s;cover, divulge, and di&s;&s;eminate doctrines that have promoted the liberty and happine&s;s of the human race. All that was rich and <HI>great,</HI> in the common acceptation of that epithet, combined again&s;t Luther; yet when pontiffs, kings, and lords had di&s;played an impotent rage, and &s;unk into that oblivion which their per&s;onal in&s;ignificance naturally led to, Luther prevailed, and his glory is immor|tal. He broke the chain of &s;uper&s;tition, and weakened the bonds of de&s;poti&s;m.</P>
<P>I have frequently, and from the fir&s;t com|mencement of our pre&s;ent unfortunate and di&s;|graceful ho&s;tilities, lifted up my voice&mdash;a fee|ble one indeed&mdash;again&s;t war, that great pro|moter of de&s;poti&s;m; and while I have liberty to write, I will write for liberty. I plead weakly, indeed, but &s;incerely, the cau&s;e of mankind; and on them, under GOD, I rely for protection again&s;t that mercile&s;s SPIRIT which I attempt to explode.</P>

<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECTION I. INTRODUCTORY.</HEAD>
<P>MAN, in a &s;tate of &s;implicity, uncorrupted by the influence of bad education, bad examples, and bad government, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a ta&s;te for all that is good and beautiful. He is capable of a degree of moral and intellectual improvement, which advances his nature to a participation with the divine. The world, in all its magnificence, appears to him one va&s;t theatre, richly adorned and illuminated, into which he is freely admitted, to enjoy the glorious &s;pectacle. Acknowledging no <HI>natural</HI> &s;uperior but the great architect of the whole fabric, he partakes the delight with con&s;cious dignity, and glows with gratitude. Plea&s;ed with him&s;elf and all around him, his heart dilates with benevolence, as well as piety; and he finds his joys augmented by communi|cation. His countenance cheerful, his mien erect, he rejoices in exi&s;tence. Life is a con|tinual
<PB N="2" REF="028936_0010_0FDD740DB8D2A568">fea&s;t to him, highly &s;ea&s;oned by virtue, by liberty, by mutual affection. God formed him to be happy, and he becomes &s;o, thus fortunately unmole&s;ted by fal&s;e policy and op|pre&s;&s;ion. Religion, rea&s;on, nature, are his guides through the whole of his exi&s;tence, and the whole is happy. VIRTUOUS INDEPEN|DENCE, the &s;un, which irradiates the morning of his day, and warms its noon, tinges the &s;erene evening with every beautiful variety of color, and, on the pillow of religious hope, he &s;inks to repo&s;e in the bo&s;om of Providence.</P>
<P>But where is man to be found, thus noble, thus innocent, thus happy? Not, indeed, in &s;o many parts of the terraqueous globe as he ought to be; but &s;till he is to be found where|ver the rights of nature and the virtues of &s;im|plicity are not violated or bani&s;hed by the fal&s;e refinements, the ba&s;e artifices of corrupted go|vernment.</P>
<P>Unhappily for man, &s;ociety has been almo&s;t univer&s;ally corrupted, even by the arts in|tended for its improvement; and human na|ture is gradually depraved in its very progre&s;s to civilization. Metamorpho&s;ed by the tam|pering of un&s;kilful or di&s;hone&s;t politicians, and the craft of intere&s;ted prie&s;ts, co-operating with politicians, MAN at pre&s;ent appears, in many countries, a diminutive and di&s;torted animal, compared with what he was in his primaeval &s;tate. He is become the dwarf and the cripple of courts and cities in&s;tead of the well-formed, beautiful, creature, who once
<PB N="3" REF="028936_0011_0FDD740F38033FA8">bounded, in the glory of health and &s;trength, over the fore&s;t and the mountain, glowing with the warmth of virtue, and breathing the &s;pirit of independence.</P>
<P>Various are the cau&s;es which contribute to the factitious depravity of man. Defective and erroneous education corrupts him; the prevalent examples of a degenerate commu|nity corrupt him; but bad <HI>government</HI> cor|rupts him more than all other cau&s;es com|bined. The grand adver&s;ary of human virtue and happine&s;s is DESPOTISM. Look over the &s;urface of the whole earth, and behold man, the glory and deputed lord of the creation, withering under the influence of de&s;poti&s;m, like the plant of temperate climes &s;corched by the &s;un of a torrid zone. The leaf is &s;ickly, the blo&s;&s;om dares not expand its beauty, and no fruit arrives at its ju&s;t &s;ize and maturity.</P>
<P>Turkey, Italy, Aegypt! how changed from what ye were when inhabited by antient Greeks, Romans, Aegyptians! Nature, indeed, &s;till &s;miles upon them with unaltered favor. The blue mantle of the &s;kies is &s;till &s;pread over them in all its luminous magnificence. There is no rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e the earth le&s;s fertile. The corn laughs in the vallies. The tree a&s;pires to Heaven with all its original ver|dure and maje&s;ty. But MAN decays; withered, &s;hrunk, enervated; a form without &s;pirit, an animal le&s;s happy than the bea&s;ts of the field, and more ignoble, ina&s;much as degeneracy is
<PB N="4" REF="028936_0012_0FDD7411113FF848">ba&s;er than native, original, created inferiority. Fallen with the columnar ruins of better times, over which, in the&s;e countries, he often tram|ples, MAN him&s;elf appears little better than a ruin, di&s;playing all the deformity of the moul|dering pile, with &s;carcely any ve&s;tige of its for|mer magnificence. It would equally contradict philo&s;ophy and experience to attribute this moral degeneracy to the decay of nature's vigor. There is no rea&s;on to conclude that the natural faculties of men who inhabit countries once free, but now en&s;laved, are produced in a &s;tate of le&s;s perfection at this hour, than in the days of their illu&s;trious forefathers. Anato|my di&s;covers no defect in the fibres of the heart or the brain; yet the degeneracy re|mains unconte&s;ted. In truth, <HI>government</HI> has counteracted the beneficence of nature. The MEN are fallen; while the <HI>human figures,</HI> with their internal and external organization, con|tinue &s;imilar, or the &s;ame. They are inactive and pufillanimous. They a&s;pire at no extra|ordinary excellence or achievements; but crouch beneath their de&s;pot, glad of the poor privilege allowed them by a fellow-creature, as weak and more wicked than them&s;elves, to eat, drink, &s;leep and die. Any pre-eminent degree of merit among them would render the di&s;tingui&s;hed po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of it fatally illu&s;trious, the certain object of a tyrant's vengeance; and they find their be&s;t &s;ecurity in their want of virtue. By a voluntary &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to con|tempt,
<PB N="5" REF="028936_0013_0FDD7417264F9630">they retain and tran&s;mit the privilege of breathing, and build the bulwark of their &s;afety on their per&s;onal in&s;ignificance.</P>
<P>FEAR mu&s;t, of nece&s;&s;ity, become the pre|dominant pa&s;&s;ion in all countries &s;ubject to the uncontrolled dominion of an individual and his mini&s;ters: but fear chills the blood, and freezes the faculties. Under its icy influence there can ari&s;e no generous emulation, no daring &s;pirit of adventure. Enterprize is con&s;idered as dangerous, not merely from the general ca&s;uality of all human affairs, but becau&s;e it excites notice, and alarms the jealou&s;y of felfi&s;h power. Under a de&s;potic government, to &s;teal through life unob&s;erved, to creep, with timid caution, through the vale of ob&s;cu|rity, is the fir&s;t wi&s;dom; and to be &s;uffered to die in old age, without the pri&s;on, the chain, the dagger, or the poi&s;oned bowl, the highe&s;t pitch of human felicity.</P>
<P>IGNORANCE of the gro&s;&s;e&s;t kind, ignorance of man's nature and rights, ignorance of all that tends to make and keep us happy, di&s;|graces and renders wretched more tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> half the earth, at this moment, in con&s;equence of its &s;ubjugation to de&s;potic power. Ignorance, robed in imperial purple, with Pride and Cru|city by her &s;ide, &s;ways an iron &s;cepter over more than one hemi&s;phere. In the fine&s;t and large&s;t regions of this planet which we inhabit, are no liberal pur&s;uits and profe&s;&s;ions, no con|templative delights, nothing of that pure, in|tellectual employment which rai&s;es man from
<PB N="6" REF="028936_0014_0FDD74192838E3E8">the mire of &s;en&s;uality and fordid care, to a de|gree of excellence and dignity, which we con|ceive to be angelic and cele&s;tial. Without knowledge or the means of obtaining it, without exerci&s;e or excitements, the mind falls into a &s;tate of infantine imbecility and do|tage; or acquires a low cunning, intent only on &s;elfi&s;h and mean pur&s;uits, &s;uch as is vi&s;ible in the more ignoble of the irrational creatures, in foxes, apes, and monkies. Among nations &s;o corrupted, the utmo&s;t effort of genius is a court intrigue or a mini&s;terial cabal.</P>
<P>A degradation of the under&s;tanding, like this, is u&s;ually accompanied with depravity of heart. From an inability to find plea&s;ure and honorable employment in the energies of thought, in noble and virtuous action, in re|fined conver&s;ation, in arts, in commerce in learning, ari&s;es a mi&s;chievous activity in trifles, a perver&s;ion of nature, a wantonne&s;s of wick|edne&s;s, productive of flagitious habits, which render the partaker of rea&s;on the mo&s;t de&s;pi|cable and dete&s;table animal in the whole circle of exi&s;tence. Thus &s;unk under the pre&s;&s;ure of de&s;poti&s;m, who can recognize, notwith&s;tand|ing the human &s;hape they bear, the lineal de&s;cendants of Aegyptian, Grecian, Roman worthies, the glory of their times, the lumi|naries of their own country and the world, the in&s;tructors and benefactors of human na|ture? Thus the image of the Deity, &s;tamped on man at his creation, is defiled or utterly ef|faced by government, in&s;tituted and exerci&s;ed

<HEAD>SECTION II. <HI>Oriental Manners, and the Ideas imbibed in Youth, both in the We&s;t and Ea&s;t Indies, favorable to the Spirit of De&s;poti&s;m.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE foundations of the fair fa|bric of liberty in Europe were laid in ages when there was but little intercour&s;e, com|mercial or political, with the remote countries of A&s;ia and America. A hardy race, in unge|nial climates, with nerves <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">rung by the northern <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> though little refined by knowledge, felt in an early age, the &s;entiments of manly virtue, and &s;purned the ba&s;ene&s;s of &s;lavery. Luxury had not ema&s;culated their minds; and they threw off, with native ela&s;ticity, the burden of unju&s;t dominion. While they &s;ubmitted with graceful acquie&s;cence, to all lawful authority, e&s;tabli&s;hed by their own con&s;ent, for the general good; they pre&s;erved a noble con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of native dignity, and maintained a per&s;onal gran|deur, a proud independence, a greatne&s;s unin|debted to the morbid tumor of rank and riches.</P>
<P>In later times the facility of navigation and the improvements of &s;cience have brought into clo&s;e connexion the extremes of the habitable globe. The a&s;perity of manners which &s;ome|times di&s;graced the virtues of our forefathers, has indeed been &s;oftened by various and con|&s;tant intercour&s;e; the manly &s;pirit has ex|changed
<PB N="14" REF="028936_0022_0FDD742C8151C0D8">ferocity for gentlene&s;s, and rendered the energetic character con&s;i&s;tent with the ami|able. It was a happy change; for why &s;hould manly virtue a&s;&s;ume a forbidding a&s;pect, and lo&s;e the recommendation of engaging manners, the happine&s;s of loving and being loved, while it commands, by de&s;erving, cordial reverence?</P>
<P>But from the intercour&s;e of England with the Ea&s;t and We&s;t Indies, it is to be feared that &s;omething of a more &s;ervile &s;pirit has been derived, than was known among tho&s;e who e&s;tabli&s;hed the free con&s;titutions of Europe, and tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> would have been adopted, or patiently borne, in ages of virtuous &s;implicity.</P>
<P>A very numerous part of our countrymen &s;pend their mo&s;t &s;u&s;ceptible age, in tho&s;e countries, where de&s;potic manners remarkably prevail. They are them&s;elves, when <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">e&s;ted with office, treated by the natives with an idolatrous degree of reverence, which teaches them to expect a &s;imilar &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to their will, on their return to their own country. They have been accu&s;tomed to look up to per&s;onages greatly their &s;uperiors in rank and riches, with awe; and to look down on their inferiors in <HI>property,</HI> with &s;upreme contempt, as &s;laves of their will, and mini&s;ters of their luxury. Equal laws, and equal liberty at home, appear to them &s;aucy claims of the poor and vulgar, which tend to dive&s;t riches of one of the greate&s;t charms, overbearing dominion.</P>
<P>We do indeed import gorgeous &s;ilks and lu&s;cious &s;weets from the Indies, but we import,
<PB N="15" REF="028936_0023_0FDD742E0D894D30">at the &s;ame time, the &s;pirit of de&s;poti&s;m, which adds deformity to the purple robe, and bitter|ne&s;s to the honied beverage.</P>
<P>The va&s;&s;als of the feudal times, it is true, were abject &s;laves; but their &s;lavery was free|dom compared to the &s;lavery of the negro. They were not driven by the whip to work in a torrid zone. They were not wanted to ad|mini&s;ter to per&s;onal luxury; for per&s;onal luxury did not exi&s;t. But the negro is rendered a two-legged bea&s;t of burden; and looks up to the infant &s;on of his lord, as to a &s;uperior being, whom he is bound to obey, however vicious, whim&s;ical, or cruel the command. Cradled in de&s;poti&s;m, the young planter comes to England for education, and brings with him the early impre&s;&s;ions, which a few years re&s;idence in the land of freedom can &s;eldom obliterate. He returns; grows rich by the labor of &s;laves, over whom, for the &s;ake of per&s;onal &s;afety, the mo&s;t arbitrary government is exerci&s;ed, and then perhaps retires to England to &s;pend his age and acquirements in the capital, the &s;eat of plea&s;ure, the theatre of commercial &s;plendor and courtly magnificence. He mixes much in &s;ociety, and inevitably communicates his ideas, which have now taken deep root, on the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of keeping the vulgar in a &s;tate of de|pre&s;&s;ion, and &s;trengthening the hands of the rich and the powerful. In the virtuous &s;trug|gles of the lower and middle ranks for con&s;ti|tutional liberty, is it likely that he &s;hould join the conte&s;t, on the &s;ide of the people? Is it
<PB N="16" REF="028936_0024_0FDD742FA4D03D78">not mo&s;t probable, that he will throw all his weight, which, con&s;idering the <HI>weight of money,</HI> is often great, in oppo&s;ition to the popul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> &s;ide? A long &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of &s;uch men, per&s;on|ally re&s;pectable, but, from peculiar circum|&s;tances, favoring the exten&s;ion of power, and di&s;po&s;ed by habits and principles &s;ucked in with the mother's milk, to repel the claims of their inferiors, mu&s;t contribute greatly to diffu&s;e, in a free country, the &s;pirit of de&s;poti&s;m.</P>
<P>That <HI>oriental</HI> manners are unfavorable to liberty, is, I believe, univer&s;ally conceded. The natives of the Ea&s;t Indies <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ertain not the idea of independence. They treat the Europeans, who go among them to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> their riches, with a re&s;pect &s;imilar to the abject &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion which they pay to their native de&s;|pots. Young men, who in England &s;carcely po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the rank of the gentry, are waited upon in India, with more attentive &s;ervility than is paid or required in many courts of Europe. Kings of England &s;eldom a&s;&s;ume the &s;tate enjoyed by an Ea&s;t India governor, or even by &s;ubordinate officers.</P>
<P>Enriched at an early age, the adventurer returns to England. His property admits him to the higher circles of fa&s;hionable life. He aims at rivalling or exceeding all the old nobi|lity in the &s;plendor of his man&s;ions, the finery of his carriages, the number of his liveried train, the profu&s;ion of his table, in every un|manly indulgence, which an empty vanity can covet, and a full pur&s;e, procure. Such a man,
<PB N="17" REF="028936_0025_0FDD743534D99638">when he looks from the window of his &s;uperb man&s;ion, and &s;ees the people pa&s;s, cannot en|dure the idea, that they are of as much con&s;e|quence as him&s;elf, in the eye of the law; and that he dares not in&s;ult or oppre&s;s the unfortu|nate being who rakes his kennel, or &s;weeps his chimney. He mu&s;t wi&s;h to increa&s;e the power of the rich and great, that the &s;aucy vulgar may be kept at a due di&s;tance, that they may know their &s;tation, and &s;ubmit their necks to the foot of pride.</P>
<P>The property of &s;uch a man will give him great weight in parliamentary elections. He probably purcha&s;es a borough. He &s;ides with the court party on all que&s;tions; and is a great &s;tickler for the exten&s;ion of prerogative. In his neighbourhood, and as a voter for repre|&s;entatives, he u&s;es all his intere&s;t in &s;upporting &s;uch men as are likely to promote his views of aggrandizing the great, among whom he hopes to be a&s;&s;ociated, and in depre&s;&s;ing the little, whom he de&s;pi&s;es and &s;huns. Having money &s;ufficient, his pre&s;ent object is a title. This he knows can only come from the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of power, to whom, therefore, he pays &s;uch a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion as he has &s;een paid to him&s;elf in India by oriental &s;laves. His whole conduct tends to increa&s;e the influence of riches, from which alone, he is con&s;cious, he derives his own im|portance. What is his eloquence? What his learning? What his beneficence to mankind? Little; perhaps none. But his e&s;tate is large,
<PB N="18" REF="028936_0026_0FDD7436F2FADF70">his hou&s;e large, his park large, his manors many, his equipage, on a birth-day, the mo&s;t &s;plendid in St. James's-&s;treet. Long-Acre gives him a pa&s;&s;port to court favor. With a feat in the hou&s;e, and an unrivalled equi|page and man&s;ion, he deems him&s;elf ju&s;tly entitled to be made, in due time, a baronet at lea&s;t, if not an hereditary law-giver of his country.</P>
<P>By a con&s;tantly &s;ucce&s;&s;ive influx of &s;uch men from the ea&s;tern climes, furni&s;hed with the means of corruption, and inclined to pro|mote arbitrary principles of government, it cannot be doubted, that much is contributed to the &s;pirit of de&s;poti&s;m. Who among them would not add to the ma&s;s of that power and &s;plendor, to po&s;&s;e&s;s a large &s;hare of which has been the fir&s;t object of a life &s;pent in uncea&s;ing cares, at the ri&s;que of health, and in a torrid zone?</P>
<P>And what is left to oppo&s;e the &s;pirit of de&s;|poti&s;m thus animated in its progre&s;s by enor|mous opulence? Is it the virtue of the hone&s;t country gentleman, who lives on his e&s;tate, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing nothing and hoping nothing from the favor of courts? Is it the independence of the middle and lower ranks, too numerous to be bribed either by gifts or expectations? Both, it is to be feared, will be too &s;low in their oppo&s;ition to the gigantic mon&s;ter, if not too feeble. They will not often ri&s;que their repo&s;e in a dangerous conte&s;t with opulence
<PB N="19" REF="028936_0027_0FDD743B6240F778">and power. They &s;tand in awe of the &s;word and the law; which, in bad times, have been equally u&s;ed as in&s;truments of inju&s;tice. Con|tented with the enjoyment of plenty, or the amu&s;ements of rural &s;ports, they &s;ink into a &s;tate of indifference to public affairs, and thus leave the field open to tho&s;e who have no right to occupy it at all, much le&s;s exclu&s;ively.</P>
<P>Thus the community becomes divided into two de&s;criptions of men; the corruptors and the indifferent; tho&s;e who &s;eek wealth and honors without virtue, and tho&s;e who &s;eek only their own ea&s;e regardle&s;s of the public.</P>
<P>This indifference is &s;carcely le&s;s culpable than corruption. It mu&s;t be laid a&s;ide. The independent country gentleman, &s;econded by the people, is the character, on whom liberty mu&s;t rely, as on her firme&s;t &s;upporter, again&s;t the incur&s;ion of oriental pride. Let him pre|&s;erve his independence by frugality. Let him beware of emulating either the oriental or occidental up&s;tart, in expences which he can|not equal, without dimini&s;hing his patrimony and lo&s;ing his independence. Let him culti|vate every &s;ocial virtue, re&s;ide on his e&s;tate, and become popular by exhibiting &s;uperior excellence both of heart and under&s;tanding. He will then do right to offer him&s;elf a candi|date in his vicinity for a &s;eat in the &s;enate; becau&s;e, as a &s;enator, he will gain a power to act with effect again&s;t the increa&s;ing weight of corrupt influence. The truly WHIG PARTY,
<PB N="20" REF="028936_0028_0FDD743DB48505C8">the lovers of liberty and the people, is not only the mo&s;t favorable to human happine&s;s, but certainly mo&s;t congenial to the con&s;titution of England, and ought to be &s;trengthened by the junction of all independent men, lovers of peace, liberty, and human nature.</P>
<P>The TORY AND JACOBITE SPIRIT, under other more plau&s;ible names, is &s;till alive, and has encrea&s;ed of late. All who have a ju&s;t idea of the Briti&s;h con&s;titution, and of the value of liberty, will oppo&s;e it, by cultivating manline&s;s of &s;pirit, by illuminating the minds of the people, and by in&s;piring them with a regard to truth, ju&s;tice, and independence, together with a love of order and of peace, both internal and external.</P>

<P>MANY who have ari&s;en to high elevation of rank or fortune, &s;eem to think that their nature has undergone a real meta|morpho&s;is; that they are refined by a kind of chemical proce&s;s, &s;ublimed by the &s;un&s;hine of royal favor, and &s;eparated from the faeces, the dro&s;s and the dregs of ordinary humanity; that humanity, of which the ma&s;s of mankind partake, and which, imperfect as it is, God created.

Learning and virtue may be added, if perad|venture they come ea&s;ily; but the formation of connexions, and the a&s;&s;umption of in&s;olence, is indi&s;pen&s;able. To promote this purpo&s;e, pocket-money is be&s;towed on the pupil with a lavi&s;h hand by his parents, and all his cou&s;ins who court his favor.

<P>Let us now &s;uppo&s;e the &s;tripling grown too tall for &s;chool, and entered at an univer&s;ity. The Engli&s;h univer&s;ities are admirably well adapted to flatter the pride of wealth and title.

They are thus taught to believe, that a &s;ilken gown and a velvet cap are &s;ub&s;titutes for knowledge; and that the rank of gentlemen commoners di&s;|pen&s;es with the nece&s;&s;ity of that devotion which others are compelled to profe&s;s in the college chapels.

<HEAD>SECTION IV. <HI>Corruption of Manners has a natural Tendency to promote the Spirit of De&s;poti&s;m.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WHEN man cea&s;es to venerate virtue in him&s;elf, he &s;oon lo&s;es all &s;en&s;e of moral beauty in the human &s;pecies. His ta&s;te becomes gro&s;s; and he learns to con&s;ider all that is good and great, as the illu&s;ion of &s;im|ple minds, the un&s;ub&s;tantial phantom of a young imagination. Extreme &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s is his ruling principle, and he is far from &s;crupulous in following its dictates. Luxury, vanity, avarice, are his characteri&s;tics. Ambition in|deed takes its turn; yet, not that noble ambi|tion, which &s;eeks prai&s;e and honors by de&s;erving them, but the low &s;pirit of intrigue and cunning, which teaches to &s;ecure high appointments, titular di&s;tinctions, or whatever el&s;e can flatter avarice and pride, by petty &s;tratagem, unmanly compliance, the violation of truth and con&s;i&s;|tency, and at la&s;t the &s;acrifice of a country's intere&s;t and &s;afety.</P>
<P>In nations enriched by commerce, and among families loaded with opulence by the avarice of their forefarthers, the mere wantonne&s;s of unbounded plenty will occa&s;ion a corruption of manners, dangerous to all that renders &s;ociety happy, but favorable to the de&s;potic principle. Plea&s;ure of the meane&s;t kind will be the fir&s;t
<PB N="29" REF="028936_0037_0FDD745C6F2FA2B8">and the la&s;t pur&s;uit. Splendor, external &s;how, the o&s;tentation of riches, will be deemed ob|jects of prime con&s;equence. A COURT will be the place of exhibition; not of great merits, but of fine garments, graceful attitudes, and guady equipages, every frivolous di&s;tinction, which boldly claims the notice due to virtue, and a&s;&s;umes the dignity which public &s;ervices ought &s;olely to appropriate.</P>
<P>The mind of man, &s;till wanting in the mid&s;t of external abundance, an object in futurity; and &s;atiated, even to lothing, with the continual banquet of plenty, longs to add titular honors, or official importance, to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;uper|fluous property. But the&s;e, if they mean any thing, are naturally the rewards of virtuous and u&s;eful exertion; and &s;uch exertion is in|compatible with the habitual indolence, the ignorance, the di&s;&s;ipation, the vice of exorbi|tant wealth, gained only by mean avarice, and expended in enjoyments that degrade, while they enervate. Men, di&s;tingui&s;hed by riches only, po&s;&s;e&s;s not, amid&s;t all their acquirements, the proper price that &s;hould purcha&s;e civil di&s;|tinctions, if they were di&s;po&s;ed of only to <HI>merit.</HI> There they are bankrupts. They have no claims on &s;ociety; for their purpo&s;es have been &s;elfi&s;h, and their conduct injurious: yet the di&s;tinctions mu&s;t be obtained, or they &s;icken in the mid&s;t of health, and &s;tarve, though &s;ur|rounded with plenty. How then &s;hall they be obtained? They mu&s;t be bought with money; but how bought? Not directly, not in the
<PB N="30" REF="028936_0038_0FDD746413AAAEE8">market-place, not at public &s;ale. But is there a borough hitherto anti-mini&s;terial, and to convert which from the error of its ways, a very expen&s;ive election mu&s;t be engaged in? The ambitious a&s;pirant at honors is ready with his pur&s;e. By money he triumphs over oppo|&s;ition, and adds the weight of his wealth to mini&s;terial preponderance. He a&s;&s;i&s;ts others in the &s;ame noble and generous &s;ervices of his country. Though covetous, he per&s;everes, regardle&s;s of expence, and at la&s;t richly merits, from his patron, the glittering bauble which hung on high, and led him patiently through tho&s;e dark and dirty paths which terminate in the temple of pro&s;tituted honor. His brilliant &s;ucce&s;s excites others to tread in his &s;teps with eager emulation; and though many fail of the glorious prize, yet all contribute, in the &s;elfi&s;h pur&s;uit, to increa&s;e and to diffu&s;e the &s;pirit of de&s;poti&s;m.</P>
<P>Men de&s;titute of per&s;onal merit, and unre|commended by the plea of public &s;ervices, can never obtain illu&s;trious honors, where the people po&s;&s;e&s;s a due &s;hare of power, where liberty flouri&s;hes, unblighted by corruption; and therefore &s;uch men will ever be oppo&s;ed to the people, and determined enemies to liberty. The atmo&s;phere of liberty is too pure and defe|cated for their lungs to inhale. Gentles and other vermin can exi&s;t only in filth and putre|faction. Such animals, if they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed rea&s;on, would therefore endeavor to contaminate every healthy climate, to de&s;troy the vital &s;alubrity
<PB N="31" REF="028936_0039_0FDD7466F563A5F8">of the liberal air, and diffu&s;e corruption with &s;y&s;tematic indu&s;try.

<P>Corruption does not operate, in the increa&s;e of the de&s;potic &s;pirit, on the highe&s;t orders only, and the a&s;pirants at political di&s;tinction and con&s;equence, but al&s;o on the crouded ranks of commercial life. In a great and rich nation, an immen&s;e quantity and variety of articles is ever wanted to &s;upply the army and the navy. No cu&s;tomers are &s;o valuable as the public. The pay is &s;ure and liberal, the demand enormous, and a very &s;crupulous vigilance again&s;t fraud and extortion &s;eldom maintained with rigid uniformity. Happy the mercantile men who can procure a contract! The hope of it will cau&s;e an ob&s;equious acqui|e&s;cence in the mea&s;ures of the ruling mini&s;ter. But it happens that &s;uch acquie&s;cence, in &s;uch men, is peculiarly dangerous, in a commercial country, to the cau&s;e of freedom.

And is this employment, thus u&s;eful and honorable, to be confined to a few among the race of mortals? Is there to be a monopoly of political action and &s;peculation? Why then did Heaven be&s;tow rea&s;on and &s;peech, powers of activity, and a &s;pirit of enterprize, in as great perfection on the lowe&s;t among the people, as on tho&s;e who, by no merit of their own, inherit wealth and high &s;tation? Heaven has declared its will by its acts. Man contravenes it; but time, and the progre&s;&s;ive improvement of the under&s;tanding, will reduce the anomaly to its natural rectitude. And if a few irregularities &s;hould &s;ometimes ari&s;e in the proce&s;s, they are of no importance when weighed with the happy re&s;ult; the return of di&s;torted &s;y&s;tems to truth, to rea&s;on, and the will of God. Occa&s;ional ferments, with all their inconveniences, are infinitely preferable to the putre&s;cence of &s;tagnation. They are &s;ymptoms of health and vigor; and though they may be attended with tran&s;ient pain, yet while they continue to appear at
<PB N="38" REF="028936_0046_0FDD7479B4590040">intervals, there is no danger of mortification. Good hearts, accompanied with good under|&s;tandings, &s;eldom produce, even where mi&s;|taken, la&s;ting evil. They repair and compen|&s;ate.</P>
<P>But I repent that the people &s;hould be en|lightened, in every rank, the highe&s;t as well as the lowe&s;t, to render them capable of perfect liberty, without danger of tho&s;e evils which its enemies are always a&s;&s;erting to be its una|voidable con&s;equences. The vulgar mu&s;t be in&s;tructed not merely in the arts which tend to the acqui&s;ition, increa&s;e and pre&s;ervation of money, but in a generous philo&s;ophy. They mu&s;t be liberalized. They mu&s;t early learn to view human life and &s;ociety in their ju&s;t light; to con&s;ider them&s;elves as e&s;&s;ential parts of a whole, the integrity of which is de&s;irable to every component member. Their ta&s;te will improve with their under&s;tanding; and they will &s;ee the beauty of order, while they are convinced of its utility. Thus principled by virtue, and illuminated with knowledge, they will eagerly return, after every deviation, which even a warmth of virtue may cau&s;e, to regular obedience, and to all the functions of citizens; valuing the public peace and pro&s;|perity, becau&s;e they under&s;tand clearly that the public happine&s;s is intimately combined with their own. They may infringe laws, from the imperfection of their nature; but they will return to their obedience without force; having been convinced that no laws
<PB N="39" REF="028936_0047_0FDD747D6ACF9070">are made, but &s;uch as are nece&s;&s;ary to their well-being in &s;ociety. They will con&s;ider laws, not as chains and fetters, but as helmets and &s;hields for their protection. The light of the under&s;tanding will correct the eccentricities of the heart; and all deviations, however rapid at their commencement, will be &s;hort in extent and tran&s;itory in duration.</P>
<P>Such would be the effect of enlightening the people with political knowledge, and en|larging their minds by pure philo&s;ophy. But what &s;ay the de&s;pots? Like the tyrannical &s;on of Philip, when he reprimanded Ari&s;totle for publi&s;hing his Di&s;coveries, they whi&s;per to their myrmidons, "Let us diffu&s;e darkne&s;s round the land

<P>That &s;uch are the &s;entiments of the men who wi&s;h for the exten&s;ion of royali&s;m and the depre&s;&s;ion of the people, is evident from the unea&s;ine&s;s they have &s;hewn at all benevolent attempts to diffu&s;e knowledge among the poor.

Scribblers of books and pamphlets, in the &s;ame vile cau&s;e, have intimated their apprehen&s;ions that the poor may learn to read political books in learning to read their Bible; and that the reading of political books mu&s;t unavoidably produce di&s;content. A wretched compliment to the cau&s;e which they mean to defend! It is impo&s;&s;ible not to infer from their apprehen&s;ions, that as men increa&s;e in under&s;tanding and knowledge, they mu&s;t &s;ee rea&s;on to di&s;approve the &s;y&s;tems e&s;tabli&s;hed. The&s;e men breathe the very &s;pirit of de&s;poti&s;m, and wi&s;h to communicate it. But their con|duct, in this in&s;tance, is an argument again&s;t the &s;pirit which they endeavor to diffu&s;e.

<HEAD>SECTION VI. <HI>On the Venality of the Pre&s;s under the Influ|ence of the de&s;potic Spirit, and its Effects in diffu&s;ing that Spirit.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful, as well as the mo&s;t in&s;idious mode of aboli&s;hing an in&s;titution which favors liberty, and, for that rea&s;on, alarms the jealou&s;y of encroaching power, is to leave the form untouched, and gradually to annihilate the e&s;&s;ence. The voracious worm eats out the kernel completely, while the hu&s;k continues fair to the eye, and apparently entire. The gardener would cru&s;h the in&s;ect, if it com|menced the attack on the external tegument; but it carries on the work of de&s;truction with efficacy and &s;afety, while it corrodes the un&s;een fruit, and &s;pares the out&s;ide &s;hell.</P>
<P>The liberty of the pre&s;s in England is not openly infringed. It is our happine&s;s and our glory. No man or &s;et of men, whatever be their power or their wi&s;hes, dares to violate this &s;acred privilege. But in the heathen my|thology we learn, that when Jupiter him&s;elf could not force certain ob&s;tacles by his thun|der-bolt he found an ea&s;y admi&s;&s;ion, in the &s;hape of a golden &s;hower.</P>
<P>In times when the jacobitical, tory, &s;elfi&s;h, and de&s;potic principles rear their heads, and think opportunities favor their efforts for re|vival,
<PB N="42" REF="028936_0050_0FDD74826A4A81F0">the pre&s;s is bought up as a powerful engine of oppre&s;&s;ion. The people mu&s;t be de|ceived, or the de&s;pots have no chance to prevail in the di&s;&s;emination of doctrines, unnatural, non&s;en&s;ical, and injurious to the rights human nature. The only channel, through which the knowledge of what it mo&s;t imports them to know, next to morality and religion, devolves upon the ma&s;s of the community, is a new&s;|paper. This channel mu&s;t therefore be &s;ecured. The people's money mu&s;t be employed to pol|lute the waters of truth, to divert their cour&s;e, and, if occa&s;ion requires, to &s;top them with dams, looks, and floodgates. The pre&s;s, that grand battery, erected by the people to defend the citadel of liberty, mu&s;t be turned again&s;t it. Pamphlets are tran&s;ient, and confined in their operation. Nothing will &s;atisfy the zeal of the a&s;&s;ailant, but the <HI>diurnal</HI> papers of intelligence. They keep up a daily attack, and reach every part of the a&s;&s;aulted edifice.</P>
<P>New&s;papers, thus bought with the people's money, for the purpo&s;e of deceiving the peo|ple, are, in the next place, circulated with all the indu&s;try of zealous partizans, and all the &s;ucce&s;s, that mu&s;t attend the full exertion of mini&s;terial influence. Public hou&s;es in great towns, are frequently the property of overgrown traders, who &s;upply them with the commodities they vend; and who dictate the choice of the papers, which they &s;hall purcha&s;e for the peru&s;al of their cu&s;tomers. Whoever frequents &s;uch hou&s;es, ruled as they are by petty de&s;pots, mu&s;t
<PB N="43" REF="028936_0051_0FDD7483705496D0">&s;wallow the fal&s;e politics, together with the adulterated beverage, of the lordly manufac|turer. A di&s;tre&s;s for rent, or an arre&s;t for debt, might follow the ra&s;h choice of a paper favor|able to truth, ju&s;tice, and humanity. If any conver&s;ation &s;hould ari&s;e among the cu&s;tomers, friendly to liberty, in con&s;equence of peru&s;ing an interdicted print of this kind, the licence of the hou&s;e might be in danger, and an hone&s;t trade&s;man with his family turned out of doors to &s;tarve. Spies are &s;ent to his hou&s;e to mix with the gue&s;ts, that in the moment of convivial exhilaration, when prudence &s;leeps, &s;ome incau|tious comment on the new&s;paper may be &s;eized and carried to the agent of de&s;poti&s;m, who, like the tiger, thir&s;ting for human blood, lies watch|ing for his prey in the covert of ob&s;curity. The ho&s;t, therefore, for the &s;ake of &s;afety, gladly rejects all papers of intelligence, which are free to &s;peak the truth, and becomes a u&s;eful in&s;tru|ment, in the hands of &s;elfi&s;h placemen, in the di&s;&s;emination of doctrines &s;ubver&s;ive of liberty, and therefore of the con&s;titution which is found|ed upon it as a corner &s;tone.</P>
<P>So far as &s;uch venal papers are diffu&s;ed, un|der influence thus arbitrary, the liberty of the pre&s;s is, in effect, de&s;troyed. It is made to &s;erve the purpo&s;es of &s;lavery, by propagating principles unfavorable to the people's rights, by palliating public abu&s;es, varni&s;hing mini&s;te|rial mi&s;conduct, and concealing facts in which the people are mo&s;t deeply intere&s;ted. Perhaps there is nothing which contributes &s;o much to diffu&s;e the &s;pirit of de&s;poti&s;m as venal new&s;pa|pers,
<PB N="44" REF="028936_0052_0FDD7484F90CFEE8">hired by the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of power, for the purpo&s;e of defending and prolonging their po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion. The more ignorant cla&s;&s;es have a won|derful propen&s;ity to be credulous in all that they &s;ee in print, and will ob&s;tinately continue to believe a new&s;paper, to which they have been accu&s;tomed, even when notorious facts give it the lie. They know little of hi&s;tory, nothing of philo&s;ophy, and adopt their political ideas from the daily lectures of a paper e&s;ta|bli&s;hed &s;olely to gain their favor to one party, the party po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of pre&s;ent power; zealous for its exten&s;ion and prolongation, and natu|rally de&s;irous of preventing all &s;crupulous en|quiry into its abu&s;e. Such means, &s;o u&s;ed, certainly &s;erve the cau&s;e of per&s;ons in office, and gratify avarice and pride; but it is a &s;er|vice which, while it promotes the fordid views of a few individuals, militates again&s;t the &s;pirit of con&s;titutional freedom. It is a vile cau&s;e, which cannot be maintained to the &s;ecurity and &s;atisfaction of tho&s;e who wi&s;h to maintain it, without recour&s;e to daily fal&s;ehood, and the cowardly concealment of con&s;cious malver&s;ation. Hone&s;t purpo&s;es love the light of truth, and court &s;crutiny; becau&s;e the more they are known, the more they mu&s;t be honored. The friends of liberty and man are ju&s;tly alarmed, whenever they &s;ee the pre&s;s pre-occupied by power, and every artifice u&s;ed to poi&s;on the &s;ources of public intelligence.</P>
<P>In every free country, the people, who pay all expences, claim a right to know the true &s;tate of public affairs. The only means of
<PB N="45" REF="028936_0053_0FDD748DE982B198">acquiring that knowledge, within reach of the multitude, is the pre&s;s; and it ought to &s;up|ply them with all important information, which may be divulged without betraying intended mea&s;ures, the accompli&s;hment of which would be fru&s;trated by communication to a public enemy. The very papers them&s;elves, which communicate intelligence, pay a tax above the intrin&s;ic value of the work and materials, to the &s;upport of the government: and the &s;tamp, which vouches for the payment, ought, at the &s;ame time, if any regard were paid to ju&s;|tice and honor, to be an authentic te&s;timony that government u&s;es no arts of deception in the intelligence afforded.</P>
<P>But let any one review, if it be not too nau&s;eous an employment, the prints which of late years have been notoriou&s;ly in the pay of mini&s;terial agency. There he will &s;ee the gro&s;&s;e&s;t attempts to impo&s;e on the public credu|lity. He will &s;ee the exi&s;tence of known facts, when they militate again&s;t the credit of a mini&s;|try, doubted or denied; doubtful victories ex|tolled beyond all re&s;emblance to truth; and de|feats, in the highe&s;t degree di&s;graceful and in|jurious, artfully extenuated. All who have had apportunities of receiving true intelligence, after &s;ome great and unfortunate action, have been a&s;toni&s;hed at the effrontery which has di|mini&s;hed the number of lives lo&s;t to a &s;um &s;o &s;mall, as contradicts the evident conclu&s;ions of common &s;en&s;e, and betrays the features of fal&s;e|hood at the fir&s;t appearance. All who have
<PB N="46" REF="028936_0054_0FDD748FA722B128">been able to judge of the privileges of Engli&s;h|men, and the rights of human nature, have &s;een with abhorrence, doctrines boldly broached and &s;ophi&s;tically defended, which &s;trike at once at the Engli&s;h con&s;titution, and the happine&s;s of man in &s;ociety. They have &s;een this done by tho&s;e who pretended an almo&s;t exclu&s;ive re|gard to law, order, and religion; them&s;elves gro&s;sly violating all of them, while they are reviling others for the &s;uppo&s;ed violation, in the bittere&s;t language which rancour, &s;timulated by pride and avarice, can utter.</P>
<P>When great mini&s;ters, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a thou&s;and means of patronizing and rewarding ob&s;equious in&s;truments of their ambition, are willing to corrupt, there will never be wanting needy, unprincipled, and a&s;piring per&s;ons to receive the infection. But can men be really great, really honorable&mdash;can they be patriots and philanthropi&s;ts&mdash;can they be zealous and &s;incere friends to law, order, and religion, who thus be&s;itate not to break down all the fences of honor, truth, and integrity; and render their admini&s;tration of affairs more &s;imilar to the juggling tricks of confederate &s;harpers, than to the grave, ingenuous conduct of &s;tate&s;men, renowned for their wi&s;dom and revered for their virtue? Do men thus exalted, who&s;e conduct is a model, and who&s;e opinion is ora|cular, mean to teach a great nation that con|&s;cience is but a name, and honor a phantom? No books of tho&s;e innovators, whom they per|&s;ecute, contribute to di&s;credit the &s;y&s;tem, which
<PB N="47" REF="028936_0055_0FDD7496315086E8">the&s;e men &s;upport, &s;o much as their own &s;ini&s;ter mea&s;ures of &s;elf-defence.</P>
<P>There is little hope of preventing the cor|ruption of the diurnal papers by any remon|&s;trance addre&s;&s;ed to men, who, entrenched behind wealth and power, &s;corn to yield at the &s;ummons of rea&s;on. There may be more hope in appealing to the readers and encouragers of &s;uch papers. Do they wi&s;h to be deceived? is it plea&s;ant to be mi&s;led by partial, mutilated, and di&s;torted narratives? Is it manly to be|come voluntary dupes? Or is it honorable, is it hone&s;t, to co-operate with any men, for any purpo&s;es, in duping others? No; let the pre&s;s, however it may be perverted by private per&s;ons, to the injury of &s;ociety, be pre&s;erved by the public, by men high in office, the guardians of every valuable in&s;titution, as an in&s;trument of good to the community, as the &s;upport of truth, as the lamp of knowledge.</P>
<P>Though the liberty of the pre&s;s &s;hould be pre&s;erved, yet let it be remembered, that the corruption of the pre&s;s, by high and overbear|ing influence, will be almo&s;t as pernicious to a free country as its de&s;truction. An <HI>imprimatur</HI> on the pre&s;s would &s;pread an alarm which would immediately remove the re&s;traint; but the corruption of the pre&s;s may in&s;inuate it&s;elf unperceived, till the &s;pirit of de&s;poti&s;m, pro|moted by it, &s;hall at la&s;t connive at, or even con&s;ent to, its total abolition.</P>

<P>PERSONS who owe all their pre|eminence to the merit of their forefathers, or ca&s;ual events, which con&s;titute good fortune, are u&s;ually de&s;irous of fixing a &s;tandard of dignity, very different from real worth, and &s;pare no pains to depreciate per&s;onal excel|lence; all &s;uch excellence as is, in fact, the mo&s;t honorable, becau&s;e it cannot exi&s;t without talents or virtues. Birth and riches, fa&s;hion and rank, are in their e&s;timation infinitely more honorable and valauble, than all the pene|trating &s;agacity and wonderful &s;cience of a Newton. Such per&s;ons value Newton more as a knight than as a philo&s;opher; more for the title be&s;towed upon him by Queen Anne, than the endowment given him by God, and im|proved by his own meritorious exertion.</P>
<P>Upon this principle, many men in our times, who wi&s;h to extend and aggrandize that POWER, from who&s;e arbitrary bounty they derive all the honor they are capable of acquiring, en|deavor to throw contempt on PHILOSOPHY. It may indeed be doubted whether they all know the meaning of the word; but they know it implies a merit not derived from
<PB N="49" REF="028936_0057_0FDD749AAFE65058">princes, and therefore they wi&s;h to degrade it. Their fountain of honor, they conceive, has no re&s;emblance, in its nature or efficacy, to the famed fountains of Parna&s;&s;us: it conveys no in&s;piration, except that which di&s;plays it&s;elf in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ide.</P>

Philo&s;ophy and philo&s;ophers have been mentioned by men, who&s;e attainments would only qualify them for di&s;tinction in a ball-room, with expre&s;&s;ions of hatred and contempt due only to thieves, murderers, the very outca&s;ts and refu&s;e of human nature.</P>
<P>The mind is naturally led to inve&s;tigate the cau&s;e of &s;uch virulence, and to a&s;k how has Philo&s;ophy merited this u&s;age from the tongue of factitious grandeur. The re&s;entment ex|pre&s;&s;ed again&s;t Philo&s;ophy is expre&s;&s;ed with a peevi&s;hne&s;s and acrimony that proves it to proceed from the &s;en&s;e of a &s;ore place. How has pride been &s;o &s;everely hurt by philo&s;ophy? It has been expo&s;ed, laid open to the eye of mankind in all its nakedne&s;s. Philo&s;ophy has held the &s;cales, and rejected the coin that wanted weight. Philo&s;ophy has applied the touch&s;tone, and thrown away the counterfeit. Hence the &s;pirit of de&s;poti&s;m is incen&s;ed again&s;t Philo&s;ophy; and if proclamations or cannon|balls
<PB N="50" REF="028936_0058_0FDD749C25E90C30">could de&s;troy her, her perdition would be inevitable and eternal. Folly exclaims aloud, "Let there be no light to detect my paint and tin&s;el." But happily, the com|mand of Folly, however imperial her tone, is not the fiat of Omnipotence. Philo&s;ophy therefore will &s;urvive the anathema; and, &s;tanding on the rock of truth, laugh at the artillery of confederated de&s;pots.</P>
<P>When &s;he de&s;erts truth, &s;he no longer de|&s;erves to be called Philo&s;ophy: and it mu&s;t be owned, that when &s;he has attacked religion, &s;he has ju&s;tly lo&s;t her reputation. But here it is well worthy of remark, that tho&s;e who now mo&s;t bitterly revile her, gave them&s;elves little concern about her, till &s;he de&s;cended to <HI>polities.</HI> She might have continued to argue again&s;t <HI>religion;</HI> and many of her pre&s;ent oppo&s;ers would have joined in her cry with alacrity: but the moment &s;he entered on the holy ground of polities, the ignorant grandees &s;huddered at the profanation, and 'Avaunt, Philo&s;ophy,' was the word of alarm.</P>
<P>Philo&s;ophy, &s;o far from de&s;erving con|tempt, is the glory of human nature. Man approaches by contemplation to what we conceive of cele&s;tial purity and excellence. Without the aid of philo&s;ophy, the ma&s;s of mankind, all over the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">erraqueous globe, would have &s;unk in &s;lavery and &s;uper&s;tition, the natural con&s;equences of gro&s;s ignorance. Men at the very bottom of &s;ociety, have been enabled by the natural talents they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed,
<PB N="51" REF="028936_0059_0FDD749DDA78F270">&s;econded by favorable opportunities, to reach the highe&s;t improvements in philo&s;ophy; and have thus lifted up a torch in the valley, which has expo&s;ed the weakne&s;s and defor|mity of the ca&s;tle on the mountain, from which the oppre&s;&s;ors &s;allied, in the night of darkne&s;s, and &s;pread de&s;olation with impunity. De&s;pots, the meane&s;t, the ba&s;e&s;t, the mo&s;t brutal and ignorant of the human race, would have tram|pled on the rights and the happine&s;s of men unre&s;i&s;ted, if philo&s;ophy had not opened the eyes of the &s;ufferers, &s;hewn them their own power and dignity, and taught them to de&s;pi&s;e tho&s;e giants of power, as they appeared through the mi&s;ts of ignorance, who ruled a va&s;&s;al world with a mace of iron. Liberty is the daughter of Philo&s;ophy; and they who dete&s;t the offspring, do all that they can to vilify and di&s;countenance the mother.</P>
<P>But let us calmly con&s;ider what is the ob|ject of this philo&s;ophy, &s;o formidable in the eyes of tho&s;e who are bigotted to antient abu&s;es, who hate every improvement, and who wi&s;h to &s;ubject the many to the control of an arbitrary few. Philo&s;ophy is ever em|ployed in finding out whatever is GOOD, and whatever TRUE. She darts her eagle eye over all the bu&s;y world, detects error and mi&s;chief, and points out modes of improve|ment. In the multiform &s;tate of human affairs, ever obnoxious to decay and abu&s;e, it is her's to meditate on the means of melioration. She

<HEAD>SECTION VIII. <HI>Of Loyalty, and certain mi&s;taken Ideas of it.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE ma&s;s of the community, on whom the arts of delu&s;ion are chiefly practi&s;ed by politicians, are &s;eldom accurate in the u&s;e of words: and among others which they mi&s;|under&s;tand, and are led, by the &s;atellites of de&s;poti&s;m, to mi&s;apply, is the term, Loyalty.</P>
<P>Loyalty means, in its true &s;en&s;e, a firm and faithful adherence to the law and con&s;titution, of the community of which we are members. If monarchy be a part of that con&s;titution, it certainly means a firm and faithful attachment to the per&s;on of the monarch, as well as to the monarchical form, and all the other branches of the &s;y&s;tem. It is nearly &s;ynonymous with fidelity; but as fidelity may be actuated &s;olely by principles of duty, loyalty &s;eems, in its common acceptation, to include in it al&s;o a &s;entiment of affection. It is the obedience of love, and anticipates compul&s;ion. It is a &s;enti|ment, which all good men will feel, when they live under a good government hone&s;tly admi|ni&s;tered.</P>
<P>But mark the di&s;ingenuity of men impelled by high-church, high tory, or jacobitical prin|ciples. They would limit this liberal compre|hen&s;ive principle, which takes in the whole of
<PB N="56" REF="028936_0064_0FDD74AFED99E3A0">the con&s;titution, and therefore tends to the con&s;ervation of it all, in its full integrity; they would limit it to the <HI>per&s;on of the monarch,</HI> to that part of the whole, which favors, in their opinion, their own purpo&s;es, and the exten&s;ion of power and prerogative, the large&s;&s;es of which they hope to &s;hare in reward for their &s;ycophantic zeal, their &s;lavi&s;h, &s;elfi&s;h, perfidi|ous adulation.</P>
<P>They repre&s;ent this confined loyalty as a religious duty, partaking the nature of divine wor&s;hip. They &s;et up an idol, and command all men, upon their duty, to adore it. The people are not entitled even to attention by the propagators of this inhuman, anti-chri&s;tian idolatry.</P>
<P>Let us con&s;ider a moment the mi&s;chief this artifice has in former times occa&s;ioned to our country. It attached great numbers to the family of the Stuarts, after they had forfeited all right to the crown; to the <HI>per&s;ons</HI> of the Stuarts, and for a long period, hara&s;&s;ed the lawful king and the people of this nation with wars, alarms, &s;editions, and trea&s;ons. Tory zealots &s;hed their blood freely, on the impul&s;e of this unrea&s;onable loyalty, which di&s;regarded the ruling powers of their country e&s;tabli&s;hed by law; and, in promoting the intere&s;t of a di&s;|po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed individual, con&s;idered a whole people, either as a non-entity, or as worthy to be &s;acri|ficed for ONE MAN. Such men, acting in con&s;i&s;tency with their principles of fal&s;e loyalty, would have drenched their country in blood to
<PB N="57" REF="028936_0065_0FDD74AFF2E8D640">re&s;tore an exiled Nero, of the <HI>true-bred,</HI> royal family.</P>
<P>Narrow loyalty, like this, which is but an|other name for bigotry, mu&s;t ever be inimi|cal to a monarch limited by laws, wi&s;hing to govern by them, and owing his &s;eat on his throne to a revolution, to the expul&s;ion of a pre-occupant, and the refu&s;al of a pre|tender's claim. It mu&s;t ever keep alive a doubt of his title. If it a&s;&s;umes the appear|ance of affection for him, it may be &s;u&s;pected as the ki&s;s of Judas. If it &s;hould &s;educe him to extend his power beyond the con&s;titutional limits, it would lead him to de&s;truction; and involve a people in all the mi&s;ery of revolu|tionary di&s;order. Is then &s;uch loyalty a public virtue? In cunning men it is but mean &s;er|vility endeavoring to ingratiate it&s;elf with the prince, for honors and emoluments. In the &s;imple ones, it is &s;illy &s;uper&s;tition. In both, it is injurious to the king of a free country and to the con&s;titution. It confines that atten|tion to one branch, which ought duly to be di&s;tributed among ALL, and to comprehend, in its attachment, that <HI>main root and &s;tock,</HI> from which all the branches grow, the PEOPLE AT LARGE.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s, &s;uch is the &s;ubtle policy of tho&s;e who are actuated by the principles of Tories, Jacobites, royali&s;ts, de&s;pots, (call them by which name you plea&s;e,) that they continue to repre&s;ent every &s;pirited effort in favor of the people's rights, as originating in
<PB N="58" REF="028936_0066_0FDD74B11AE8E2B0">di&s;loyalty. The be&s;t friends to the con&s;titution in its purity, and therefore the be&s;t friends to the limited monarch, are held out, both to public and to royal dete&s;tation, as di&s;affected to the per&s;on of the prince. Every &s;tratagem is u&s;ed to delude the common and unthinking part of the people into a belief, that their only way of di&s;playing loyalty is, to di&s;play a mo&s;t &s;ervile ob&s;equiou&s;ne&s;s to the throne, and to oppo&s;e every popular mea&s;ure. The procurers of addre&s;&s;es, couch them in the mo&s;t unmanly language of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, and approach with a degree of pro&s;tration of &s;entiment, worthier to be received by the great mogul or the Chine&s;e emperor, than the chief magi&s;trate of a free people. The compo&s;ers and pre&s;enters of &s;uch te&s;timonies of loyalty, hoping for knighthood at lea&s;t, if not &s;ome more &s;plendid or &s;ub&s;tan|tial effect of royal gratitude, exhau&s;t the lan|guage of all its &s;ynonymous terms, to expre&s;s their abject &s;ervility. Yet, after all, of &s;uch a nature is their loyalty, that, if a Stuart or a Robe&s;pierre were the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of power, their mean and hollow profe&s;&s;ions of attachment would be equally ardent and importunate. <HI>The powers that be</HI> are the powers which they wor|&s;hip. The proffer of their lives and fortunes is the common &s;acrifice. But to di&s;tingui&s;h their loyalty, they would go farther than the addre&s;&s;ers of the fooli&s;h and unfortunate James, and pre&s;ent their &s;ouls to be di&s;po&s;ed of by their earthly Deity; knowing it to be a <HI>&s;afe</HI> oblation.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="028936_0067_0FDD74B2E95D62D0">
As great re&s;pect is due to the office of the &s;upreme magi&s;trate, &s;o al&s;o is great affection due to his per&s;on, while he conducts him&s;elf with propriety, and con&s;ults the happine&s;s of the people. The mo&s;t decorous language &s;hould be u&s;ed to him, the mo&s;t re&s;pectful behaviour pre&s;erved towards him; every mode adopted of &s;hewing him proofs of love and honor, <HI>on this &s;ide idolatry.</HI> Arduous is his ta&s;k, though honorable.

But I will not pay a limited monarch, at the head of a free people, &s;o ill a compliment, as to treat him as if he were a de&s;pot, ruling over a land of &s;laves. I cannot adopt the &s;pirit of de&s;poti&s;m in a land of liberty; and I mu&s;t reprobate that fal&s;e, &s;elfi&s;h, adulatory loyalty, which, &s;eeking nothing but its own ba&s;e ends of avarice or ambition, and feeling no real attachment either to the per&s;on or the office of the king, contributes neverthe|le&s;s to diffu&s;e by its example, a &s;ervile, abject temper, highly promotive of the de&s;potic &s;pirit.</P>
<P>But the <HI>mini&s;ters</HI> of &s;tate have &s;ometimes pre&s;umed &s;o far on pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of power, as to attempt to make the people believe, that a <HI>loyalty</HI> is due to <HI>them;</HI> that an oppo&s;ition to <HI>their</HI> will is a proof of defective loyalty; a remon&s;trance again&s;t <HI>their</HI> mea&s;ures, a mark of di&s;affection. They have not been un&s;uc|ce&s;sful. The &s;ervile herds who come forward
<PB N="60" REF="028936_0068_0FDD74B7B304EDA8">into public life, &s;olely <HI>to be bought up,</HI> when marketable, are, for the mo&s;t part, more inclin|ed to wor&s;hip the mini&s;ter than the monarch. While it is the <HI>prie&s;t</HI> who divides among the &s;acrificers the fle&s;h of the victim, many attend with devotion at the &s;acrifice; who are more de&s;irous of propitiating the prie&s;t than the Deity. There are many who, if they had it in their power, would make it con&s;tructive trea&s;on to cen&s;ure any mini&s;ter, who&s;e continu|ance in place is nece&s;&s;ary to realize their pro&s;|pects of riches and titular di&s;tinction. Such men wander up and down &s;ociety as &s;pies, and mark tho&s;e who blame the <HI>mini&s;ter,</HI> as per&s;ons to be &s;u&s;pected of di&s;loyalty. They u&s;ually &s;ix on them &s;ome nickname, in order to depre|ciate their characters in the eyes of the people, and prevent them from ever ri&s;ing to &s;uch a degree of public e&s;teem, as might render them competitors for mini&s;terial douceurs. A&s;&s;ocia|tions are formed by &s;uch men, under pretence of patrioti&s;m and loyalty, but with no other real de&s;ign, than that of keeping the mini&s;ter in place, whom they hope to find a bountiful pay-ma&s;ter of their &s;ervices, at the public ex|pence.</P>
<P>True loyalty has no connection with all this meanne&s;s and &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s. True loyalty is manly, while obedient, and re&s;pects it&s;elf, while it pays a voluntary and cheerful deference to au|thority and the per&s;ons inve&s;ted with it. It throws &s;ordid con&s;iderations a&s;ide, and having nothing in view but the general good, bears an
<PB N="61" REF="028936_0069_0FDD74B96CE55110">affection, and &s;hews that affection, to the whole of a &s;y&s;tem e&s;tabli&s;hed for the pre&s;erva|tion of order and liberty. It is not mi&s;guided by pompous names, nor blinded by the glitter of external parade; but values offices and officers in the &s;tate, for the good they actually promote, for the important functions they per|form, for the efficient place they fill, in the finely con&s;tituted machine of a well-regulated community.</P>
<P>Such loyalty, I believe, does abound in England, notwith&s;tanding the calumnies of in|tere&s;ted men, who would mi&s;repre&s;ent and cry down all real patrioti&s;m, that their own coun|terfeit may obtain currency.

<P>May tho&s;e times never come! but yet let us cheri&s;h the true loyalty and explode the fal&s;e; becau&s;e the true is the be&s;t &s;ecurity to limited monarchy and con&s;titutional liberty: while the fal&s;e, by diffu&s;ing a &s;pirit of de&s;poti&s;m, equally inimical to the con&s;titution and to human hap|pine&s;s, is de&s;troying the legal limitations, un|dermining the e&s;tabli&s;hed &s;y&s;tems, and intro|ducing manners and principles at once degrad|ing to human nature, and pregnant with mi&s;ery to nations.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION IX. <HI>On taking Advantage of popular Commotions, accidental Exce&s;&s;es, and foreign Revolutions, to extend Prerogative and Power, and en|croach on the Liberties of the People.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE riots in London, which, to the di&s;grace of magi&s;tracy, and the boa&s;ted vigilance of mini&s;ters, (richly paid as they are, to guard the public &s;afety), arrived from con|temptible beginnings to a formidable magnitude in the year 1780, have been con&s;idered by courtiers, and tho&s;e who are continually labor|ing to exalt prerogative at the expence of liberty, as extremely favorable to their pur|po&s;e. They cau&s;ed an univer&s;al panic. The cowardice, folly, and perhaps wickedne&s;s of certain public functionaries, were the true cau&s;e of the exten&s;ive mi&s;chief; but the exce&s;&s;es of a few mo&s;t wretched rioters, who &s;carcely knew what they were doing; children, women, and drunken per&s;ons, were attributed to the PEO|PLE. Argumente were drawn from the event again&s;t popular characters, popular books, popular a&s;&s;emblies, and in favor of military coercion. Military a&s;&s;ociations in the capital were encouraged, and the bank of England became a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">. Liberty has few votaries in compari&s;on with Property.

<PB N="63" REF="028936_0071_0FDD74BF883D8710">grew under its operation. The Tory and Ja|cobite party exulted over the ruins, and would have rejoiced in building a Ba&s;tille with the dilapidations. "See," &s;aid they, as they triumphed over the &s;cene, "the effects of <HI>power</HI> in the hands of the PEOPLE!"</P>
<P>But the truth is, the <HI>people,</HI> the grand ma&s;s of the community, were not at all concerned in effecting the mi&s;chief; for I cannot call a fortuitous a&s;&s;emblage of boys, beggars, women, and drunkards, the people. The fir&s;t irregu|larities might have been &s;uppre&s;&s;ed by the &s;lighte&s;t exertions of manly &s;pirit. But tho&s;e who were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of efficient places and their emoluments, enjoying the &s;weets of office with|out &s;uffering a &s;en&s;e of its duties to embitter them, di&s;played no &s;pirit, and left it to be fairly inferred that they had it not. The people at large were not to be blamed for the&s;e unfortu|nate events; the whole of the culpability be|longed to the appointed mini&s;ters of the law, in whom the people tru&s;ted and were deceived.

<P>The artful encroachers on liberty were not deceived in calculating the effects re&s;ulting from this total dereliction of duty on the part of the civil magi&s;trate. Almo&s;t immediately a a damp was ca&s;t on the generous ardor, which,
<PB N="64" REF="028936_0072_0FDD74C0F54C4D68">under a Wyvil, a Richmond, a Portland, and a Pitt, was &s;eeking the &s;alvation of the country, in a well-timed and deliberate reform of the hou&s;e of commons. A &s;ew, indeed, remained equally zealous in the vir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ous cau&s;e; but the minds of the many were pal&s;ied by the panic, and &s;eemed ready to acquie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ce under every corruption attended with tranquillity, rather than ri&s;k a reform, which, they were taught to believe, could not be effected without popu|lar commotion.

<P>In a few years the public mind &s;eemed to have relinqui&s;hed its intentions of effecting a &s;peedy reform. It &s;eemed to adopt the phy&s;i|cian's maxim, <HI>Malum bene
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Though this evil is <HI>malum</HI> male <HI>po&s;itum.</HI></NOTE> po&s;itum ne moveto;</HI> and he&s;itated to undertake the removal of a local pain, left it &s;hould throw the morbid matter over the whole habit. The fear of exciting a general inflammation prevented men from probing and cleaning the inveterate ulcer. In the mean time, the &s;ore is growing wor&s;e, and if not &s;topped in its progre&s;s, mu&s;t termi|nate in a mortification.</P>
<P>Thus important and exten&s;ive were the con&s;equences of a popular tumult, dangerous indeed and terrible in it&s;elf, but artfully ex|aggerated and abu&s;ed by intere&s;ted courtiers, for the prevention of parliamentary reform, and the di&s;credit of all popular proceedings.
<PB N="65" REF="028936_0073_0FDD74C276279238">When any appeal to the people was in agita|tion, on any bu&s;ine&s;s whatever, it was &s;uffi|cient to &s;ay, "Remember the riots," and the intended mea&s;ure was immediately relinqui&s;hed. A glorious opportunity for the growth of de&s;|potic opinions! The high-church, and high|government bigots rejoiced as if they had gained a complete victory. They already &s;ang Te Deum.</P>
<P>But in the mid&s;t of their triumphs, as human affairs are &s;eldom long &s;tationary, the French revolution commenced. Every hone&s;t and en|lightened mind exulred at it; but the news was like a death-bell to the ears of the &s;yco|phants. So large, &s;o powerful a part of Europe emancipated from the fangs of de&s;|poti&s;m, bla&s;ted all the budding hopes of tho&s;e who are rather meditating the e&s;tabli&s;hment than the demolition of ab&s;olute rule.

<P>But the morning which ro&s;e &s;o beautifully in the political horizon of France was &s;oon overclouded. The pa&s;&s;ions of leaders, jealous of each other, menaced from within and from

Cruelties, which even de&s;pots might &s;hudder to perpetrate, were the effects of a &s;ituation rendered dangerous in the extreme, and almo&s;t de&s;perate, by the general attack of all neighboring nations. The friends of liberty and humanity wept; but the factors of de&s;pot|i&s;m triumphed once more. "Here," &s;aid they, "we have another in&s;tance of the unfit|ne&s;s of the people for the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of power, and the mi&s;chievous effects of exce&s;&s;ive liberty." Every art which ingenuity can practi&s;e, and influence a&s;&s;i&s;t in its operation, was exerted to abu&s;e and villify the French revolution. A&s;&s;o|ciations were formed to di&s;&s;eminate childi&s;h books, favoring the &s;pirit of de&s;poti&s;m, ad|dre&s;&s;ed to the meane&s;t of the people, who yet had too much &s;en&s;e to be &s;educed by &s;enti|ments, doctrines, and language calculated only for the meridian of the nur&s;ery.

<P>The &s;pirit of de&s;poti&s;m now went forth with greater confidence than it had ever a&s;&s;umed &s;ince the expul&s;ion of the Stuarts.

They boa&s;ted of their princi|ples, and pretended that they alone were friends to law, order, and religion They talked of the laws of England not being &s;evere enoug<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> for the puni&s;hment of &s;edition, and boldly expre&s;&s;ed a wi&s;h that the laws of Scot|land might be adopted in their place. Active promoters of parliamentary reform were now accu&s;ed of trea&s;onable intentions by the very per&s;ons who were once loude&s;t in their invec|tives again&s;t the corruption of the hou&s;e of commons. New&s;papers were hired to calum|niate the be&s;t friends of freedom. Writers appeared in various modes, commending the old government of France; and pouring the mo&s;t virulent abu&s;e on all who promoted or defended its abolition. Prie&s;ts who panted for preferment preached de&s;poti&s;m in their pulpits, and garretteers who hungered after places or pen&s;ions, racked their invention to propagate its &s;pirit by their pamphlets. Fear in the well|meaning, &s;elf-intere&s;t in the knavi&s;h, and &s;y&s;te|matic &s;ubtilty in the great party of tories, cau&s;ed a general uproar in favor of principles and prac|tices ho&s;tile to con&s;titutional liberty.</P>
<P>It is, however, the nature of all violent pa|roxy&s;ms to be of tran&s;ient duration. The

<P>Sen&s;ible men, and true friends to the con|&s;titution, and therefore to the king, who forms &s;o con&s;iderable a part of it, will be on their guard again&s;t fal&s;e alarms excited by courtiers; le&s;t in the fear of &s;ome future evil, from popular commotion, they lay a&s;ide that everwaking vigilance which is nece&s;&s;ary to guard the good in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, their con&s;titutional liberty, from the &s;ecret depredation of the artful &s;poiler, who is always on the watch to encroach on popular rights and privileges.</P>
<P>Riots, tumults, and popular commotions, are indeed truly dreadful, and to be avoided with the utmo&s;t care by the lovers of liberty. Peace, good order, and &s;ecurity to all ranks, are the natural fruits of a free con&s;titution. True patriots will be careful to di&s;courage every thing which tends to de&s;troy them; not only becau&s;e whatever tends to de&s;troy them

By the utmo&s;t attention to pre&s;erving the public peace, true patriots will defeat the malicious de&s;igns of &s;ervile courtiers; but, whatever may hap|pen, they will not de&s;ert the cau&s;e of human nature. Through a dread of licentiou&s;ne&s;s, they will not for&s;ake the &s;tandard of liberty. It is the part of fools to fall upon Scylla in &s;triving to avoid Charybdis. Who but a fool would wi&s;h to re&s;tore the perpetual de&s;poti&s;m of the old French government, through a dread of the tran&s;ient outrages of a Pari&s;ian tumult?

<P>Dr. Price has a pa&s;&s;age &s;o applicable to the pre&s;ent &s;ubject, that I &s;hall beg leave to clo&s;e this &s;ection by the citation of it: and on the mention of his name, I mu&s;t pay a trifling tri|bute to his memory, which is the more nece&s;|&s;ary, as his character has been &s;candalou&s;ly a&s;per&s;ed by tho&s;e who are ever bu&s;y in di&s;|crediting the people and their friends, and who, pretending a love of goodne&s;s and religion, blacken with their foule&s;t calumny tho&s;e who are &s;ingularly remarkable for both, for no other rea&s;on than that, under the influence of good|ne&s;s and religion, &s;uch per&s;ons e&s;pou&s;e the

<P><Q>Licentiou&s;ne&s;s and de&s;poti&s;m are more near|ly allied than is commonly imagined.

<PB N="71" REF="028936_0079_0FDD74D5307FFC30">the&s;e evils, mankind have often run into the other.</HI> But all well-con&s;tituted governments guard equally again&s;t both. Indeed, of the two, the la&s;t is, on &s;everal accounts, the lea&s;t to be dreaded, and has done the lea&s;t mi&s;chief. It may truly be &s;aid, if licentiou&s;ne&s;s has de&s;|troyed its thou&s;ands, de&s;poti&s;m has de&s;troyed its millions. The former having little power, AND NO SYSTEM TO SUPPORT IT, nece&s;&s;a|rily finds its own remedy; and a people &s;oon get out of the tumult and anarchy attending it. But a de&s;poti&s;m, wearing a form of go|vernment, and being armed with its force, is an evil not to be conquered without dreadful &s;truggles. It goes on from age to age, deba&s;|ing the human faculties, levelling all di&s;tinc|tions, and preying on the rights and ble&s;&s;ings of &s;ociety. It de&s;erves to be added, that in a &s;tate di&s;turbed by licentiou&s;ne&s;s, there is an ANIMATION which is favourable to the hu|man mind, and puts it upon exerting its pow|ers; but in a &s;tate habituated to de&s;poti&s;m, all is &s;till and torpid.

<P>THERE is nothing which I can &s;o relactantly pardon in the GREAT ONES of this world, as the little value they entertain for the life of a man. Property, if &s;eized or lo&s;t, may be re&s;tored; and without property, man may enjoy a thou&s;and delightful plea&s;ures of exi&s;tence.

But can the lords of this world, who are &s;o lavi&s;h of the lives of their inferiors, with all their boa&s;t|ed power, give the cold heart to beat again, or relume the light of the eye once dimmed by the &s;hades of death? Accur&s;ed de&s;pots, &s;hew me your authority for taking away that which ye never gave, and cannot give; for undoing the work of God, and extingui&s;hing the lamp of life which was illuminated with a ray from heaven. Where is your charter to privilege murder? You do the work of Satan, who was a de&s;troyer; and your right, if you po&s;&s;e&s;s any, mu&s;t have originated from the father of mi&s;chief and mi&s;ery.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="028936_0081_0FDD74D840609690">
There is nothing &s;o precious as the life of a man. A philo&s;opher of antiquity, who po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed not the religion of philanthropy, who knew not that man came from heaven, and is to return thither; who never heard the doc|trine authenticated, that man is favored with a communication of the divine nature by the Holy Spirit of God; yet, under all the&s;e di&s;|advantages, maintained that HOMO EST RES SACRA, that every HUMAN CREATURE is CONSECRATED to God, and therefore invio|lable by his fellow man, without profanation. All the gold of Ophir, all the geins of Gol|conda, cannot buy a &s;ingle life, nor pay for its lo&s;s. It is above all price.</P>
<P>Yet take a vie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> of the world, and you will immediately be led to conclude, that &s;carcely any thing is viler than human life. Crimes which have very little moral evil, if any, and which therefore cannot incur the vengeance of a ju&s;t and merciful Deity, are puni&s;hed with death at a human tribunal. I mean &s;tate crimes; &s;uch actions, conduct, &s;peeches, as are made crimes by de&s;pots, but are not recogni&s;ed as &s;uch in the decalogue; &s;uch as may proceed from the pure&s;t and mo&s;t virtuous principle, from the mo&s;t enlarged benevolence, from wi&s;dom and unaffected patrioti&s;m; &s;uch as may proceed from mere warmth of temper, neither intending nor accompli&s;hing any mi&s;chief; the mere effects of error, as innocent too in its con&s;equences as its origin. But the de&s;pot is offended or frightened; for guilt trembles at
<PB N="74" REF="028936_0082_0FDD74DDC2844598">the lea&s;t alarm, and nothing but the blood of the accu&s;ed can expiate the offence.</P>
<P>Yet numerous as are the innocent victims of the tribunal, where to offend the &s;tate is the greate&s;t abomination that man can commit, they are lo&s;t and di&s;appear when compared to the myriads &s;acrificed to the demon of wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> De&s;poti&s;m delights in war. It is its element. As the bull knows, by in&s;tinct, that his &s;trength is in his horns, and the eagle tru&s;ts in his talons; &s;o the de&s;pot feels his pui&s;&s;ance mo&s;t, when &s;urrounded by his &s;oldiery arrayed for battle. With the &s;word in his hand, and his artillery around him, he rejoices in his might, and glo|ries in his greatne&s;s. Blood mu&s;t mark his path; and his triumph is incomplete, till death and de&s;truction &s;talk over the land, the har|bingers of his triumphant cavalcade.</P>
<P>We hear much of nece&s;&s;ary wars; but it is certainly true, that a real, ab&s;olute, unavoid|able nece&s;&s;ity for war, &s;uch as alone can render it ju&s;t, has &s;eldom occurred in the hi&s;tory of man. The pride, the wanton cruelty of ab&s;o|lute princes, caring nothing for human life, have in all ages, without the lea&s;t nece&s;&s;ity, involved the world in war; and therefore it is the common cau&s;e of all mankind to aboli&s;h ab&s;olute power; and to di&s;courage, by every lawful means, the &s;pirit that leads to any de|gree of it. No individual, however good, is fit to be tru&s;ted with &s;o dangerous a depo&s;it. His goodne&s;s may be corrupted by the mag|nitude of the tru&s;t; and it is the nature of
<PB N="75" REF="028936_0083_0FDD74DFAC01FDC0">power, uncontrolled by fear or law, to vitiate the be&s;t di&s;po&s;itions. He who would have &s;huddered to &s;pill a drop of blood, in a ho&s;tile conte&s;t, as a private man, &s;hall deluge whole provinces, as an ab&s;olute prince, and laugh over the &s;ubjugated plains which he has fer|tilized with human gore.</P>
<P>What are the chief con&s;iderations with &s;uch men, previou&s;ly to going to war, and at its conclu&s;ion? Evidently the expence of MONEY. Little is &s;aid or thought of the lives lo&s;t, or devoted to be lo&s;t, except as matters of <HI>pecu|niary</HI> value. Humanity, indeed, weeps in &s;ilence and &s;olitude, in the &s;eque&s;tered &s;hade of private life; but is a &s;ingle tear &s;hed in courts, and camps, and cabinets? When men high in command, men of fortune and family, fall, their deeds are blazoned, and they figure in hi&s;tory; but who, &s;ave the poor widow and the orphan, enquire after the very names of the rank and file? There they lie, a ma&s;s of hu|man fle&s;h, not &s;o much regretted by the de&s;pots as the hor&s;es they rode, or the arms they bore. While &s;hips often go down to the bottom, &s;truck by the iron thunderbolts of war, and not a life is &s;aved; the national lo&s;s is e&s;timated by the de&s;pot, according to the weight of metal wa&s;ted, and the magnitude and expence of the wooden ca&s;tle.</P>

<PB N="76" REF="028936_0084_0FDD74E166D38788">heir of immortality. God made no di&s;tinction of per&s;ons; but behold a being, born to a &s;ceptre, though a poor, puny, &s;hivering mor|tal like the re&s;t, pre&s;umes to fell, and let out for hire, the&s;e images of God, to do the work of butchers, in any cau&s;e, and for any pay|ma&s;ter, on any number of unoffending fellow-creatures, who are &s;tanding up in defence of their hearths, their altars, their wives, their children, and their liberty. Great numbers of men, trained to the trade of human butchery, are con&s;tantly ready to be let to hire, to carry on the work of de&s;poti&s;m, and to &s;upport, by the money they earn in this helli&s;h employ|ment, the luxurious vices of the wretch who calls them his property. Can that &s;tate of human affairs be right and proper, which per|mits a mi&s;creant, &s;carcely worthy the name of a man, &s;unk in effeminacy, the &s;lave of vice, often the mo&s;t abominable kind of vice, igno|rant and illiterate, debilitated with di&s;ea&s;e, weak in body as in mind, to have &s;uch domi|nion of hundreds of thou&s;ands, his &s;uperiors by nature, as to let them out for pay, to mur|der the mnocent &s;tranger in cold blood?</P>

<P>What &s;hall we think of the practice of what is called CRIMPING? Is it to be allowed in a free country? Are not men bought, inveigled, or forced by it, as if they were cattle, bea&s;ts of the field or the fore&s;t, and capable of beco|ming the <HI>property</HI> of the purcha&s;er or the cap|tor? If a nation &s;hould behold with patience &s;uch a practice increa&s;ing and encouraged by the great, would there not be rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect, that it had lo&s;t the &s;pirit of freedom, and was preparing to &s;ubmit its neck to the yoke of de&s;poti&s;m? Is not an impre&s;&s;ed &s;ailor or a kid|napped &s;oldier one of the images of God? Is he not entitled to all the rights of nature, and the &s;ociety of which he is a member? Does poverty disfranchize a man, rob him of his rights, and render his <HI>life</HI> a commodity to be bought and &s;old, or thrown away, at the will of a rich man, who is enabled to take advan|tage of his want, and add to the misfortune of indigence the cur&s;e of &s;lavery? Are a few pieces of &s;ilver to be allowed, by connivance, if not by legal permi&s;&s;ion, as the price of blood, when poverty, but not the will, con&s;ents to the &s;ale?</P>
<P>Even if BOXING were ever to become a &s;pectacle patronized by princes, and encouraged by a people, there would be rea&s;on to fear le&s;t MAN, AS MAN, had lo&s;t his value; le&s;t life were e&s;timated of little price: and le&s;t the

<P>The dignity of human nature, in de&s;potical countries, is treated as a burle&s;que. A man is le&s;s dignified than a pampered hor&s;e, and his life infinitely le&s;s valued. But in a land of liberty, like ours, every man &s;hould learn to venerate him&s;elf and his neighbor, as a noble creature, dependent only on God, on rea&s;on, on law. Life, under &s;uch circum&s;tances, is a pearl of great price. Every human being, under &s;uch circum&s;tances, is of equal value in the &s;ight of God. They, therefore, who, in con&s;equence of civil elevation, hold any man's life cheap and vile, unle&s;s he has forfeited his rights by enormous crimes, are guilty of rebel|lion again&s;t God, and ought to be hunted out of &s;ociety; as the wolf, once the native of England's fore&s;ts, was exterminated from the i&s;land.</P>

<P>THE opinion, that the majority of the PEOPLE have no concern in political di&s;|qui&s;itions, is at once in&s;ulting and injurious. They who maintain it, evidently mean to make a &s;eparation in the minds of men, be|tween the government and the nation.

<P>Such an opinion is fit only for a country &s;ubject to ab&s;olute power, and in which the people, con&s;idered only as conquered &s;laves, hold their lives and all their enjoyments at the will of the conqueror.

<P>As to the intellectual abilities of the people, it is certain that &s;ome of the able&s;t &s;tate&s;men, law-givers, and men of bu&s;ine&s;s, have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rigi|nated from that order which is called plebeian.

Ple|beians have arrived at the very fir&s;t rank in all arts and &s;ciences; and there is nothing in po|litics &s;o peculiarly ab&s;tru&s;e or recondite, as to be incomprehen&s;ible by intellects that have pe|netrated into the profounde&s;t depths of philo|&s;ophy.</P>
<P>As to the right of the people to think, let him who denies it, deny, at the &s;ame time, their right to breathe. They can no more avoid thinking than breathing. God formed them to do both; and though &s;tate&s;men often act as if they wi&s;hed to oppo&s;e the will of the Deity, yet happily they want the power. And &s;ince men mu&s;t think, is it po&s;&s;ible to prevent them from thinking of the <HI>government?</HI> upon the right conduct of which depend their liberty, their property, and their lives.

They mu&s;t read no obnoxious papers or pamphlets, and they mu&s;t not utter a complaint, at the hou&s;e where they are compelled to go for refre&s;hment, which the tax prevents them from enjoying at home with their little ones.

The middle and lower ranks, too numerous to be bribed by a mini&s;ter, and almo&s;t out of the reach of court corruption, con&s;titute the be&s;t bulwarks of liberty. They are a natural and mo&s;t efficacious check on the &s;trides of power. They ought therefore to know their con&s;equence, and to pre&s;erve it with unwink|ing vigilance. They have a &s;take, as it is call|ed, a mo&s;t important &s;take, in the country. Let not the overgrown rich only pretend to have a &s;take in the country, and claim from it an ex|clu&s;ive privilege to regard its concerns. The mid|dle ranks have their native <HI>freedom</HI> to pre&s;erve; their birth-right to protect from the dangerous attacks of enormous and overbearing affluence. Ina&s;much as liberty and &s;ecurity are more con|ducive to happine&s;s than exce&s;&s;ive riches, it mu&s;t be allowed, that the poor man's &s;take in the country is as great as the rich man's. If he &s;hould lo&s;e this &s;take, his poverty, which was con&s;oled by the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of his liberty and &s;ecurity, becomes an evil infinitely aggra|vated.

He may &s;oon degenerate to a bea&s;t of burden; for the mind &s;inks with the &s;lavery of the condition. But while a man feels that he is free, and fills a re&s;pectable rank, as a freeman, in the community, he walks with upright port, con&s;cious, even in rags, of com|parative dignity.</P>
<P>While the middle and lower ranks acquaint them&s;elves with their rights, they &s;hould al&s;o

<P>To perform the part of good members of the community, their under&s;tandings mu&s;t be duly enlightened, and they mu&s;t be encouraged, rather than forbidden, to give a clo&s;e attention to all public tran&s;actions. Di&s;agreements in private life are often ju&s;tly called mi&s;under|&s;tandings. It is through want of clear concep|tions that feuds and animo&s;ities frequently happen in public. The <HI>many</HI> are not &s;o mad as they are repre&s;ented. They act hone&s;tly and zealou&s;ly according to their knowledge. Give them fair and full information, and they will do the thing that is right, in con&s;equence of it. But nothing more generally and ju&s;tly offends them, than an attempt to conceal or di&s;tort facts which concern them; an attempt to render them the dupes of intere&s;ted ambition, planning its own elevation on the ruins of their independence.</P>
<P>I wi&s;h, as a friend to peace, and an enemy to all tumultuary and riotous proceedings, that the ma&s;s of the people &s;hould under&s;tand the con&s;titution, and know, that redre&s;s of griev|ances is to be &s;ought and obtained by appeals to the law; by appeals to rea&s;on; without appealing, except in ca&s;es of the very la&s;t ne|ce&s;&s;ity, which &s;eldom occur, to the arm of vio|lence.

<P>To accompli&s;h the&s;e ends, I think too much pains cannot be be&s;towed in teaching them to under&s;tand the true nature of civil liberty; and in demon&s;trating to them, that it is injured by all exce&s;&s;es, whether the exce&s;&s;es originate in courts or cottages.</P>
<P>And &s;urely tho&s;e men are neither friends to their country nor to human nature, who, for the &s;ake of keeping down the lower orders, would object to teaching the people the value of a pure repre&s;entation, free &s;uffrage, a free pre&s;s, and trial by jury.

<P>IS man a rea&s;onable creature? Is he then mo&s;t perfect and happy, when his con|duct is regulated by rea&s;on? If &s;o, then the boa&s;ted age of CHIVALRY was an age of folly, madne&s;s, and mi&s;ery. It was an age in which a romantic imagination triumphed by force over the plaine&s;t and &s;tronge&s;t deci&s;ions of common &s;en&s;e. It was an age in which pride and wanton in&s;olence trampled on the rights and happine&s;s of human nature. To expre&s;s my idea of it in a word, it was an age of QUIXOTISM, in which Europe appeared as one va&s;t country of bedlamites. Yet, wonderful to relate, men have lately ari&s;en, pretending to extraordinary degrees of the di&s;tinctive fa|culty of man, profe&s;&s;ing the mo&s;t unbounded philanthropy, but at the &s;ame time regretting that the age of chivalry is no more.</P>
<P>The truth is, the &s;pirit of chivalry was highly favorable to the &s;pirit of de&s;poti&s;m, Every feudal baron was a petty tyrant, little differing from the chieftain of a banditti. They were ab&s;olute &s;oevereigns over their va&s;&s;als. Their ca&s;tles were fortified palaces, from which they i&s;&s;ued, regardle&s;s of government or law, like lions or tigers from their d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">, to deform
<PB N="89" REF="028936_0097_0FDD7503F01C5478">the land with blood and deva&s;tation. What was the &s;ituation of the PEOPLE, the million, in tho&s;e days of mi&s;chievous folly? It was &s;carcely better than that of the negroes in the i&s;lands of America. And are the&s;e times to be regretted in the pre&s;ent day? Yes, certainly, by tho&s;e who pine at &s;eeing the condition of the multitude meliorated, and who con&s;ider the unfortunate part of their fellow-creatures as a herd of &s;wine.</P>
<P>At this period of Engli&s;h hi&s;tory, &s;laves, natives of England, were bought and &s;old on Engli&s;h ground, ju&s;t in the &s;ame manner as the negroes in Africa. One of the chief articles of export from England, in the time of the Anglo-Saxons, was the SLAVE. Slaves were always appendant to manors, like the &s;tock of cattle on a farm. They were attached to the &s;oil, and were conveyed or de&s;cended with the e&s;tate, under the name of <HI>villains regardant, gleboe ad&s;criptitii.</HI> They were never con&s;ider|ed as <HI>citizens;</HI> they had no vote, no rights; and were in every re&s;pect, in the eye of the great men who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them, like goods, chattels, and bea&s;ts of burden.</P>
<P>As hone&s;t labor was con&s;idered as SLAVISH, &s;o al&s;o was every kind of TRADE. The only cla&s;s e&s;teemed, was that which we &s;hould now call GENTLEMEN or ESQUIRES. And what was their employment? <HI>De&s;truction of their fel|low creatures.</HI> They neither <HI>toiled nor &s;pun;</HI> but they wielded the &s;word, and &s;hed blood under the banners of their chief, whenever
<PB N="90" REF="028936_0098_0FDD75FD7441C308">he thought proper to wage war with an un|offending neighbor. They were, however, honorable men; <HI>all, all honorable</HI> men. But honor will not fill the belly, nor cloathe the back; and pride was obliged to &s;toop for food, raiment, dwellings, and all the comforts and accommodations of life, to the villain and va&s;|&s;al; who were exactly in the rank occupied by modern trade&s;men, mechanics, and arti&s;ans. The <HI>gentleman</HI> of tho&s;e days availed him&s;elf of their labor and ingenuity, and then de&s;pi&s;ed them. The GENTLEMEN of modern days, who ad|mire the age of chivalry, and who adopt tory and arbitrary principles, would be glad to con|&s;ider this u&s;eful and ingenious cla&s;s of citizens in the &s;ame light. <Q><HI>Peri&s;h our commerce, live our con&s;titution.</HI> Peri&s;h the loom, the plough, the hammer, the axe; but flouri&s;h the &s;word. Sink the merchant &s;hip, but let the man of war ride on the waves in all her glory.</Q></P>
<P>Such &s;entiments re&s;emble tho&s;e of the feudal barons, the mo&s;t de&s;potic GENTLEMEN that ever di&s;graced human nature. The old feudal barons, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">owever, could not always find em|ployment for the &s;word at home; and Peter the monk told them they would be rewarded in heaven by waging war on Pale&s;tine. They embarked with the ble&s;&s;ings of the pope on their banners. It was a fortunate event for the de&s;pi&s;ed va&s;&s;als who were left at home. Both commerce and liberty are greatly indebted to the cru&s;ades for their &s;ub&s;equent flouri&s;hing &s;tate. In the ab&s;ence of the tyrants, the trade&s;|men
<PB N="91" REF="028936_0099_0FDD750B31A5F600">and arti&s;ans exerci&s;ed their art and indu&s;try on their own account, and gradually acquired a degree of independence. Many of the barons never returned to oppre&s;s them. Many re|turned, greatly injured in &s;trength, &s;pirit, and property. Con&s;equently they lo&s;t their power. Charters were now &s;old or granted, and Com|merce lifted up her front in defiance of Pride, that, looking down from her ca&s;tle on the &s;hip and manufacturer, de&s;pi&s;ed her lowly occupa|tion, while &s;he envied her opulence. The country was enriched by arts which the nobles deemed vile. The ma&s;s of the people acquired property, and with it, power and independence. The tyranny of the feudal &s;y&s;tem, and the non|&s;en&s;e of chivalry, which endeavored to create a fanta&s;tic merit, independent of virtue and utility, &s;oon vani&s;hed when the human mind was at liberty to think for it&s;elf; and men were emboldened to act freely by a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing &s;kill and property.</P>
<P>But while the human heart is &s;ubject to pride, and fond of power, the &s;pirit of tyranny, which actuated the old barons in feudal times, will manife&s;t it&s;elf, in &s;ome mode or degree, whenever opportunities occur. Commerce was de&s;pi&s;ed under the late monarchy in France; and commerce, we have rea&s;on to think, is looked upon with a jealous eye in England, by tho&s;e who are violently attached to &s;en&s;ele&s;s grandeur.</P>
<P>Men of this de&s;cription are aver&s;e to com|merce, not only from pride, but from policy. They &s;ee commerce enriching and exalting
<PB N="92" REF="028936_0100_0FDD75106A708850">plebeians to a rank in &s;ociety equal to their own; and often furni&s;hing the means of lux|urious enjoyment and &s;plendor, which they them&s;elves, with all the pride of birth and the pre&s;umption of office, cannot &s;upport. Though a war may injure trade, and ruin ma|nufacturing towns, yet it is eagerly engaged in, if it gratifies the revenge of courts, and the pride of nobles. Its ill effects on commerce may be a recommendation of it to tho&s;e who exclaim, <HI>"Peri&s;h commerce, live our con&s;ti|tution."</HI> It reduces that a&s;piring greatne&s;s of the merchant, which treads on the heels of the grandee, and overtops him. It bleeds the body which appears in the eyes of the great to &s;hew &s;ymptoms of plethora. It clips the wings which &s;eem ready to emulate the flight of the eagle. It lops the tree which gives umbrage by its &s;hadow. The favorers of ab&s;olute power would have a nation of gentlemen &s;oldiers, of courtiers, and of titled noblemen; and they view with pain, a nation of gentlemen mer|chants, of men independent both in &s;pirit and fortune, enlightened by education, improved by experience, enriched by virtues and u&s;eful exertion, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing principles of honor founded on hone&s;ty, and therefore quite as &s;crupulous and nice as if they had been bred in idlene&s;s, bloated with the pride of ance&s;try, tyrannically imperious over the active cla&s;&s;es, and at the &s;ame time abject &s;laves to courtly fa&s;hion.</P>
<P>But, as in a commercial nation, it is impo&s;|&s;ible to prevent men of this de&s;cription from &s;ometimes acquiring princely fortunes, it be|comes
<PB N="93" REF="028936_0101_0FDD7512F5D20BB0">a very de&s;irable object, among the poli|ticians attached to arbitrary power, to corrupt the principal commercial hou&s;es, by rai&s;ing in them the &s;pirit of vanity and ambition. They have already acquired money more than &s;uffi|cient for all the purpo&s;es of aggrandizement. The next object is honor; that is, a title. A baronetage is a charming lure to the whole family. Any favor indeed from the court is a feather. A title is now and then judiciou&s;ly be&s;towed. This operates on the ri&s;ing race, and teaches them to undervalue their independ|ence in competition with the &s;mile of a mini|&s;ter. The mini&s;ter, indeed, has means of gratifying the avarice as well as the vanity of the commercial order. Contracts are delicious douceurs to the a&s;piring trader: they not only enrich, but lead to a connection with the powers that be, and pave with gold the road of ambition.</P>
<P>But the &s;un of tory favor which irradiates the tops of the mountain, &s;eldom reaches the vale. The millions of humbler adventurers in commerce and manufacture, who are enriching their country, and accommodating human life, in ten thou&s;and modes that require both virtue and &s;kill, are viewed by the promoters of arbi|trary power with &s;overeign contempt. The truth is, that mo&s;t of the&s;e, notwith&s;tanding the di&s;dain with which they are treated, are &s;ome of the mo&s;t independent members of the community. They con&s;titute a very large por|tion of the middle rank. They are a firm phalanx, and commonly enli&s;ted on the &s;ide of
<PB N="94" REF="028936_0102_0FDD751426CEFB78">liberty. They can &s;carcely be otherwi&s;e; for they have little to hope or fear from tho&s;e who call them&s;elves their &s;uperiors. They perform a work, or vend a commodity, equi|valent to the compen&s;ation they receive; and owe no obligation beyond that which civility or benevolence, towards tho&s;e with whom they negociate, impo&s;es. The cu&s;tomer applies to them for his own convenience. If they be fair traders, they vend their wares at the market price; and if one will not accede to it, they wait patiently for another offer. They do not think them&s;elves bound to make any unmanly &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions to tho&s;e who deal with them for their own advantage.</P>
<P>A numerous body of men like the&s;e, po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ing, in the aggregate, a va&s;t property, and con&s;equently, if they could act in concert, a va&s;t power al&s;o, cannot but be an object of unea&s;ine&s;s to the co-partners in a proud ari&s;to|cracy, wi&s;hing to engro&s;s to them&s;elves the whole world, with all its plea&s;ures, honors, emoluments, and rights. As they cannot de|&s;troy this body, their next endeavor is to vil|ify it, to render it in&s;ignificant, to di&s;courage its attention to public affairs, to le&s;&s;en its profits, and to embarra&s;s its operations by taxes on its mo&s;t vendible productions. They would gladly render a trade&s;man as contemptible in England, as it was in France before the revolution. In France, we all know, under its de&s;potic kings, no virtue, no merit, no &s;ervices to the public or mankind, could wipe off the filthy &s;tain fixed on the character by merchandize. The
<PB N="95" REF="028936_0103_0FDD7515A50A73D0">poore&s;t, mo&s;t villainous and vicious idiot, who partook of noble&s;&s;e, would have been e&s;teemed, in that unhappy period, infinitely &s;uperior to a Gre&s;ham, a Barnard, or a Skinner.</P>
<P>My purpo&s;e in the&s;e remarks is to exhort the mercantile order to pre&s;erve their inde|pendence, by pre&s;erving a ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of their own dignity. I &s;ee with pain and alarm the fir&s;t men in a great city, the metropolis of the world, who&s;e <HI>merchants are princes,</HI> crouding with &s;lavi&s;h &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the mini&s;ter of the day, &s;econding all his artful purpo&s;es in a cor|poration, calling out the military on the &s;lighte&s;t occa&s;ion, at once to overawe the multitude, and at the &s;ame time to annihilate their own civil and con&s;titutional authority. If they would but pre&s;erve their independence, and retain a due attachment to the people, and the rights of their fellow-citizens, their power and con&s;e|quence would be infinitely augmented, and the very mini&s;ter who buys or cajoles them, would hold them in high e&s;timation. Ultimately, perhaps, their pre&s;ent &s;ordid views might be accompli&s;hed with greater &s;ucce&s;s; as they cer|tainly would be, if accompli&s;hed at all, with more honor and &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>In&s;tead of &s;eparating their intere&s;ts, I would &s;ay, let our commerce and our con&s;titution ever flouri&s;h together. Certain I am, that a flou|ri&s;hing commerce, by giving power and con&s;e|quence to the middle and lower ranks of the people, tends more than all the military a&s;&s;ocia|tions to pre&s;erve the genuine &s;pirit of the con|&s;titution.</P>

<PB N="98" REF="028936_0106_0FDD752050EE07B8">in the work of agriculture or manufacture. After viewing the magnificent &s;tables, proceed a little farther, and you &s;ee, on the road-&s;ide, and in the village, wretched hou&s;es, without gla&s;s in the windows; the poor laborer, his wife, and children in rags; &s;carcely able to procure the &s;malle&s;t fire in the colde&s;t weather, threatened with pro&s;ecution if they pick up &s;ticks in the park; and, if they refu&s;e to <HI>endure</HI> extreme cold and hunger, in danger of being hanged, and certain of impri&s;onment. The great man, who &s;pends much of his time in the &s;table and kennel, and who care&s;&s;es the hor&s;es and dogs, conde&s;cends not to enter the cottages. He receives the lowly obei&s;ance of the inhabitants without returning it. Look at yonder corner of his park, and you &s;ee a board with an in&s;cription, threatening all who enter with MAN traps and &s;pring guns. If, tempt|ed by hunger, the poor man &s;hould venture to catch a hare or patridge, the hor&s;e-whip is threatened, and perhaps inflicted in the fir&s;t in&s;tance: and on a repetition of the atrocious crime, he and his whole family are turned out of their cottage; happy if him&s;elf be not im|pri&s;oned, though the bread of the helple&s;s de|pends on his liberty and labor.</P>
<P>This petty tyrant of a village domain &s;hall neverthele&s;s think him&s;elf entitled to repre&s;ent the next borough in Parliament. What can be expected from &s;uch a wretch, but that he &s;hould be as &s;ervilely mean and ob&s;equious to a mini&s;ter, as he is cruel and unfeeling in his

He has &s;hewn already the di&s;po&s;itions of a Nero and Domitian in miniature; and if he could obtain a throne, his &s;ceptre would be a rod of iron.

<P>If no con&s;iderable di&s;trict of a country be without &s;uch overbearing de&s;pots; if they are viewed without abhorrence, and con&s;idered as a&s;&s;uming only the common privileges of coun|try gentlemen; if &s;uch men, availing them|&s;elves of a corrupt &s;tate of repre&s;entation, often procure a &s;hare in the legi&s;lature; is not that country, if there be &s;uch an one, in danger of being over-run with the &s;pirit of de&s;poti&s;m? Are not the YEOMANRY, who are u&s;ually tenants of the&s;e lordly Nimrods, likely to be influenced by them, through fear of lo&s;ing their farms, in their votes, and in all their &s;entiments and con|duct?

<P>Among all that de&s;cription of per&s;ons who have been lately called ARISTOCRATS, proud and &s;elfi&s;h in their nature, Tories and Jacobites in their political principles, it is obvious to re|mark the mo&s;t haughty, overbearing manners in the tran&s;actions of common life, in their do|me&s;tic arrangements, in their plea&s;urable ex|cur&s;ions, their vi&s;its, their conver&s;ation, and general intercour&s;e.

Pride, &s;ervility to courts, and a mutual, though tacit, agreement to treat the PEOPLE with contempt, are among the principal recommendations to it. The grand &s;ecret of its con&s;titution is to claim dignity, di&s;tinction, power, and place, exclu&s;ively, without the painful labor of de&s;erving either by per&s;onal merit, or by &s;ervices to the com|monwealth.</P>
<P>The&s;e people pu&s;h them&s;elves forward to notice at all public places. Though they con|tribute no more than others to the &s;upport of &s;uch places, (for they are <HI>&s;ordidly par&s;imonious</HI>) yet they claim a right to dictate every regula|tion.

<P>Nothing flatters &s;uch per&s;ons more, than to have a number of their fellow-creatures en|gaged as &s;ervants about their <HI>per&s;ons,</HI> with no|thing to do, or with &s;uch employments as MAN, properly &s;o called, could not endure to have done by another.

<P>A court, with all its forms and finery, is the very element of &s;uch per&s;ons. They flutter about it like butterflies in the &s;un&s;hine; and happy he, who, in his way to it, excites the mo&s;t admiration of his gaudy coach and coat in the crowd of St. James's-&s;treet; that crowd, which neverthele&s;s they <HI>&s;corn,</HI> through fear of pollution, to look at, with eyes de&s;tined in a few minutes to enjoy the beatific vi&s;ion of royalty. But as a court is their delight; no wonder that their &s;entiments on political mat|ters are perfectly courtier-like. They are for extending the powers and prerogatives of roy|alty, from a &s;elfi&s;h idea that they can recom|mend

They think the people have little to be&s;tow but bare e&s;teem, or &s;uch offices as are honorable only in proportion as they are well or ill di&s;charged; &s;uch as require virtues and abilities: whereas, a court can be&s;tow on its favorites, without requiring painful virtues, ribbands, garters, &s;tars, and titles, all which gratify &s;uperficial minds by their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ernal finery and di&s;tinction, independently of any idea that they are, or &s;hould be, the public rewards of long and faithful &s;ervices, in promoting the welfare of the community, and the happine&s;s of the human race.</P>

The financier robbed the people. The great (as they are abu&s;ively called) received the &s;tolen goods; and the people, in return for their property thus extorted from them, were at once oppre&s;&s;ed, plundered and de&s;pi&s;ed. If a nobleman, impoveri&s;hed by his enormous vices and &s;illy vanity, married into a rich but ple|beian family, they called this degrading con|duct, the taking DUNG to fertilize their e&s;tates. At the &s;ame time, <HI>pollution</HI> as it was to <HI>marry</HI> the hone&s;t daughter of an hone&s;t merchant, they prided them&s;elves in choo&s;ing for <HI>mi&s;tre&s;&s;es</HI> not only the lowe&s;t, but the mo&s;t vicious per|&s;ons, opera-dancers, and actre&s;&s;es, notorious for pro&s;titution. Such were many of the courtiers, the noble&s;&s;e, and &s;ticklers for arbitrary power, in France; and have there not appeared in other nations, in&s;tances of &s;imilar conduct in per&s;ons of &s;imilar rank, and &s;imilar political principles?</P>
<P>In France, bi&s;hopries were u&s;ually con&s;idered as genteel provi&s;ions for the &s;ons of noble families. Religions con&s;iderations had little influence in the appointment of them. Learn|ing was not a &s;ufficient recommendation.
<PB N="104" REF="028936_0112_0FDD7533AC950E30">BLOOD was the prime requi&s;ite. If by chance a man, with every kind of merit proper for that &s;tation, ro&s;e to a bi&s;hopric, without the recommendation of blood, he was de&s;pi&s;ed by the fraternity, and called a BISHOP OF FORTUNE. I have heard in England &s;uch men as Dr. Wat&s;on, and Dr. Porteus, and Dr. Secker, with all their learning, &s;poken of as men that mu&s;t not think them&s;elves of any political con&s;equence; as men who &s;hould be &s;atsfied with their <HI>good fortune,</HI> and not pre|tend to vie with the NORTHS, and Cornwal|li&s;es, and Kepples. How would &s;uch men have de&s;pi&s;ed JESUS CHRIST and the poor fi&s;hermen! yet they love bi&s;hopries, &s;o far as they contribute to &s;ecular pomp and parade.</P>
<P>A &s;imilar &s;pirit mu&s;t produce &s;imilar conduct. Therefore tho&s;e who would not wi&s;h the man|ners of the French, as they exi&s;ted before the revolution, to prevail in their own country, will check the &s;pirit that gives ri&s;e to &s;uch manners, by every rational means of oppo&s;ition to it.

<P>The ari&s;tocratical in&s;olence is vi&s;ible where one would lea&s;t expect it; where all the par|takers of this frail and mortal &s;tate &s;hould appear in a &s;tate of equality; even at church, in the immediate pre&s;ence of Him who made high and low, rich and poor; and where the gilded and painted ornaments on the walls &s;eem to mock the folly of all human pride.

The fir&s;t rever|ence
<PB N="108" REF="028936_0116_0FDD753DD0E96C08">is paid to per&s;ons of condition around. Tho&s;e who do not bow at the name of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, bend with all lowline&s;s to the lord in the gallery.

<P>Such per&s;ons, con&s;i&s;tently with their arbi|trary principles, are always high-churchmen. Though they may be indifferent to religion, they are zealous for the church.

Upon the head of their de&s;pot, they would but a triple covering, the crown, the mitre, and the helmet. The Devil offered our Sa|viour all the kingdoms of this world and their glory, if he would fall down and wor&s;hip him; and there is rea&s;on to fear, that &s;uch idolaters of the kingdoms of this world and their glory, would apo&s;tatize from him who &s;aid <HI>his king|dom was not of this world,</HI> if the &s;ame evil being were to make them the &s;ame offer. The temporalities and &s;plendors of the church tri|umphant endear it to them; but, if it conti|nued in its primitive &s;tate, or in the condition in which it was when poor fi&s;hermen were its bi&s;hops, they would &s;oon &s;ide, in religious matters, with the <HI>mi&s;creant philo&s;ophers</HI> of France. But while mitres and &s;talls may be
<PB N="109" REF="028936_0117_0FDD753EE3CC0448">made highly &s;ub&s;ervient to the views of a mi|ni&s;ter, and the promoters of arbitrary power and principles, they honor the church, though they know nothing of Chri&s;t; they &s;tickle for the bench, though they abandon the creed. An ally, like the <HI>church,</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of great power, mu&s;t be cheri&s;hed; though the very per&s;ons who wi&s;h to avail them&s;elves of that power, would be the fir&s;t, if that power were in real danger, to que&s;tion its rights, and to accelerate its &s;ubver&s;ion.</P>
<P>There is one circum&s;tance in the conduct of the <HI>Tory</HI> friends to <HI>ab&s;olute &s;way</HI> truly alarming to the champions of liberty. They are always inclined, on the &s;malle&s;t tumult, to call in the military. They would depreciate the civil powers, and break the con&s;table's &s;taff to intro|duce the bayonet. In their opinion, the be&s;t executive powers of government are a party of dragoons. They are therefore con&s;tantly &s;ound|ing alarms, and aggravating every petty di&s;|turbance into a riot or rebellion. They are not for parleying with the many-headed mon|&s;ter; they &s;corn lenient mea&s;ures; and while their own per&s;ons are in perfect &s;afety, boldly command the military to fire. What is the life or the limb of a poor man, in their opinion? Not &s;o much as the life or limb of a favorite pointer or race-hor&s;e. They are always eager to augment the army. They would build barracks in every part of the country, and be glad to &s;ee a free country over-run, like &s;ome of the en&s;la|ved nations of the continent, from ea&s;t to we&s;t,

<P>IT is not unfair to infer the exi&s;tence of &s;imilar principles from &s;imilarity of conduct. In that black page of hi&s;tory which di&s;graces human nature; I mean the records of the Ro|man emperors, in the decline of Roman virtue; we read, that &s;pies and informers were con&s;i|dered as nece&s;&s;ary functionaries of government; that they became favorites at court, and were encouraged by rewards due only to exemplary patrioti&s;m and public &s;ervice. There have been periods al&s;o in the hi&s;tory of England, when &s;pies, informers, fal&s;e witne&s;&s;es, and pre|tended plots, were deemed lawful and u&s;eful expedients by the rulers of the &s;tate. In te&s;ti|mony of this a&s;&s;ertion, we need only call to mind the pretended Popi&s;h plot, with all its
<PB N="112" REF="028936_0120_0FDD7543DFECAF08">villainous circum&s;tances, in the reign of Charles the Second; a reign in many parts of it re&s;em|bling the times of the Roman Tiberius. But at whatever period &s;pies, informers, fal&s;e wit|ne&s;&s;es, and pretended plots are adopted by men in power, to &s;trengthen them&s;elves in office, and de&s;troy virtuous oppo&s;ition, there is rea&s;on to fear, in &s;pite of all profe&s;&s;ions of the con|trary, that the tyrannic &s;pirit of the degenerate Cae&s;ars waits but for opportunities to di&s;play it&s;elf in acts of Neronian atrocity.

<P>But what &s;hall we &s;ay? Have there been no Judas I&s;cariots in modern days?

If &s;uch things have been, is it not time to be alarmed, to guard again&s;t &s;pies, informers, and fal&s;e witne&s;&s;es? And is it not right to expre&s;s, and increa&s;e, if po&s;&s;ible, the public indignation again&s;t both them and their employers?</P>
<P>When men high in office, of reputed abili|ties, and certainly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing exten&s;ive know|ledge, patronize &s;uch mi&s;creants as &s;pies and

They teach men to carry the profligacy of public characters and conduct into the reque&s;tered walks of pri|vate life.

<P>But &s;tate-nece&s;&s;ity is urged in defence of that policy which employs &s;pies and informers. I deny the exi&s;tence of &s;uch nece&s;&s;ity. There are excellent laws, and there are magi&s;trates and officers di&s;per&s;ed all over the kingdom, who are bound to take cognizance of any illegal and injurious practices, and to prevent them by a timely interference. If &s;uch magi&s;trates and officers neglect their duty, it is incumbent on tho&s;e who appointed them, and who are amply paid for their vigilance, to in&s;titute pro&s;ecutions, to puni&s;h and to remove them. The law knows nothing of &s;pies and informers. The only watchmen it recognizes are magi&s;trates, regularly appointed. The whole body of a people, well governed, and con&s;equently con|tented with their governors, are the natural and voluntary guardians again&s;t &s;editions, trea|&s;ons, and con&s;piracies to &s;ubvert the &s;tate.
<PB N="116" REF="028936_0124_0FDD754E050998B8">When &s;pies and informers are called in, it argues a di&s;tru&s;t of the magi&s;trates, and of the whole body of the people.

<P>I have a better opinion of men in power, in our times, corrupting as the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of power is allowed to be, than to believe that any of them would hire a fal&s;e witne&s;s. But let them be a&s;&s;ured, that a hired &s;py and informer will, by an ea&s;y tran&s;ition, become a fal&s;e witne&s;s, even in trials where liberty and life are at &s;take. In trials of le&s;s con&s;equence, there is no doubt but that his con&s;cience will &s;tretch with the occa&s;ion. His object is not truth or ju&s;tice; but filthy lucre; and when he a&s;pires at great rewards, great mu&s;t be his venture. Having once bro|ken down, as a treacherous &s;py, the fences of honor and con&s;cience, nothing but fear will re&s;train him, as a witne&s;s, from overleaping the bounds of truth, ju&s;tice, and mercy. He will rob and murder under the forms of law; and add to the atrocity of blood-guiltine&s;s, the crime of perjury. No man is &s;afe, where &s;uch men are countenanced by officers of &s;tate. They them&s;elves may peri&s;h by his fal&s;e tongue; &s;uffering the vengeance due to their ba&s;e encou|ragement of a traitor to the public, by falling unpitied victims to his di&s;appointed treachery.

<P>AMONG a thou&s;and anecdotes of the frivolity of the governing part of a de&s;potic country, I &s;elect the following, merely as a &s;light &s;pecimen of the trifling di&s;po&s;ition of tho&s;e who, as they pretend, claim their elevated &s;ituations for the GOOD OF MANKIND.</P>
<Q><P>In the &s;ummer of the year 1775, the queen of France, being dre&s;&s;ed in a light-brown &s;ilk, the king good-naturedly ob&s;erved, it was <HI>couleur de puce,</HI> the color of fleas; and in|&s;tantly every lady in the land was unea&s;y till &s;he had dre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf in a &s;ilk gown of a flea color. The rage was caught by the men; and the dyers worked night and day, without being able to &s;upply the demand for flea-color. They nicely di&s;tingui&s;hed between an old and a young flea, and &s;ubdivided even the &s;hades of its body. The belly, the back, the thigh, the head, were all marked by varying tints. This prevailing color promi&s;ed to be the fa&s;hion of the winter. The &s;ilk-mercers found it would hurt their trade. They there|fore
<PB N="120" REF="028936_0128_0FDD75592315E348">pre&s;ented her maje&s;ty with patterns of new &s;attins; who having cho&s;en one, MONSIEUR exclaimed, it was the color of her <HI>maje&s;ty's</HI> HAIR!</P>
<P>Immediately the <HI>fleas</HI> cea&s;ed to be favorites at court, and all were eager to be dre&s;&s;ed in the color of her maje&s;ty's hair. Servants were &s;ent off at the moment from Fontain|bleu to Paris, to purcha&s;e velvets, ratteens, and cloths of this color. The current price of an ell in the morning had been forty livres, and it ro&s;e in the evening to eighty and ninety. The demand was &s;o great, and the anxiety &s;o eager, that &s;ome of her maje&s;ty's hair was actually obtained by bribery, and &s;ent to the Gobelins, to Lyons, and other manufactories, that the exact &s;hade might be caught and re|ligiou&s;ly pre&s;erved.</P></Q>
<P>Such was the little, mean, adulatory &s;pirit of the court of France, and of the people who at that time imitated the court with more than api&s;h mimicry. To &s;hew how little there is of truth and hone&s;ty in &s;uch &s;ervility, be it remem|bered, that the nation &s;o eager to catch the very color of the queen's hair, &s;oon afterwards cut off the head on which it grew. Nothing &s;illy, nothing over&s;trained, can be la&s;ting, be|cau&s;e it wants a &s;olid foundation. Let kings be careful how they confide in court compli|ments and the addre&s;&s;es of corruption. Ma&s;tiffs guard their ma&s;ter and his hou&s;e better than &s;paniels.</P>

While &s;uch a &s;pirit prevails among the great, it is impo&s;&s;ible that the happine&s;s of man can be duly regarded by tho&s;e who claim a right to govern him. Where frivolity and meanne&s;s are general, it is impo&s;&s;ible that the people can be wi&s;e or happy. Gaiety founded on levity or affectation, is not happine&s;s. It laughs and talks, while the heart is either unmoved or dejected. Happine&s;s is &s;erious. The noi&s;e of folly is intended to di&s;&s;ipate thought; but no man would wi&s;h his thoughts to be di&s;|&s;ipated, who finds any thing within him to think of with complacency.</P>
<P>Princes have always &s;omething important to think of, which, it might be &s;uppo&s;ed, would preclude the nece&s;&s;ity of trifling amu&s;ements to kill time. Yet courts have always been re|markable for frivolity. This frivolity is not only contemptible in it&s;elf, unworthy of rational beings, e&s;pecially when executing a mo&s;t mo|mentous tru&s;t, but productive of meanne&s;s, weakne&s;s, and corruption. Long experience has a&s;&s;ociated with the idea of a courtier in de&s;potic courts, duplicity, in&s;incerity, violation of promi&s;es, adulation, all the ba&s;e and mean qualities, rendered &s;till ba&s;er and meaner, by a&s;&s;uming, on public occa&s;ions, the varni&s;h of hypocri&s;y.</P>

<P>Era&s;mus drew from the life. Though a mo&s;t profound &s;cholar, yet he was not merely a &s;cholar. He read the book of the world with as much accuracy as the volumes of his library. I have brought forward this letter, becau&s;e I find it exemplified in the Precepts of Lord Che&s;|terfield, and the Diary of Lord Melcombe. It appears, under the te&s;timony of their own hands, that the&s;e men actually were the cha|racters which Era&s;mus, in a vein of irony and &s;arca&s;m, advi&s;es his court-pupil to become. It appears from them, that many of the per&s;ons, with whom they acted, were &s;imilar. It fol|lows that, if &s;uch men were great, wi&s;e, and
<PB N="125" REF="028936_0133_0FDD7567A08A6608">good men, truth, honor, &s;incerity, friend&s;hip, and patrioti&s;m are but empty names, devi&s;ed by politicians to amu&s;e and delude a &s;ubject and an abject people.</P>
<P>But the people (I mean not a venal mob, employed by a mini&s;ter or by a faction) are not &s;o corrupted. They value truth, honor, &s;incerity, and patrioti&s;m; and in their conduct often di&s;play them in their utmo&s;t purity. Shall courtiers, then, be li&s;tened to, when they repre|&s;ent the people as the &s;wini&s;h multitude, or as venal wretches? Shall courtiers, &s;uch as Lord Melcombe, claim an exclu&s;ive right to direct human affairs? influencing &s;enates to make and unmake laws at plea&s;ure; and to cry havoc, when they plea&s;e, and let &s;lip the dogs of war on the <HI>poor,</HI> either at home or abroad? Shall a whole nation be proud to mimic a court, not only in dre&s;s, amu&s;ements, and all the vanity of fa&s;hion, but in &s;entiments, in morals, in politics, in religion, in no religion, in hypo|cri&s;y, in CRUELTY?</P>
<P>Lord Melcombe and Lord Che&s;terfield were leading men, able men, eloquent men, con&s;i|dered in their day as ornaments of the court and of the nation. But if even they exhibit both precepts and examples of extreme &s;elfi&s;h|ne&s;s, of deceit, and of a total di&s;regard to human happine&s;s, what may we think of their numerous dependents, under-agents, per&s;ons attached to them by places, pen&s;ions, ribbands, titles, expecting favors for them&s;elves, or their natural children, or their cou&s;ins? Can we

Would they a&s;&s;ert liberty, or undergo trouble, lo&s;s, per&s;ecution, in defence of a con&s;titution? They them&s;elves would laugh at you, if you &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e it po&s;&s;ible. They can be con&s;idered in no other light than as vermin, &s;ucking the blood of the people whom they de&s;pi&s;e.</P>
<P>Yet the&s;e, and &s;uch as the&s;e, are the men who are indefatigable in declaiming again&s;t the people, talking of the mi&s;chiefs of popular government, and the danger of admitting the rights of man. The&s;e, and &s;uch as the&s;e, are the &s;trenuous oppo&s;ers of all reform in the repre&s;entation. The&s;e, and &s;uch as the&s;e, call all attempts at innovations, though evidently improvements, &s;editious. The&s;e are the alarm|i&s;ts, who cry out, the church or the &s;tate is in danger, in order to per&s;ecute hone&s;t men, or to introduce the military. The military is their delight, their fortre&s;s; and to compa&s;s their own ba&s;e ends, they will not he&s;itate to bathe their arms in human blood, even up to their very &s;houlders. Their whole object is to ag|grandize a POWER, of which they pant to par|ticipate, and from which alone, de&s;titute as they are of merit and goodne&s;s, they can hope for lucre and the di&s;tinctions of vanity.</P>

Nor can &s;uch minds be ever awakened from their fatal dream, till either the VOICE of an ABUSED people rou&s;e them INTO FEAR, or the &s;tate it&s;elf totter, through the general incapacity, cowardice, and di&s;union of tho&s;e who &s;upport it.</P>
<P>"Whenever, this compelling power, Ne|ce&s;&s;ity, &s;hall appear, then, and not till then, may we hope that our deliverance is at hand.

<P>"There are two manife&s;t rea&s;ons why, in a <HI>degenerate &s;tate,</HI> and a <HI>declining</HI> period, the united voice of a people is, in general, the &s;ure&s;t te&s;t of truth in all e&s;&s;ential matters on which their own welfare depends, &s;o far as the ends of political mea&s;ures are concerned.</P>
<P>"<HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Becau&s;e in &s;uch a period, and &s;uch a &s;tate, the body of a people are naturally the lea&s;t corrupt part of &s;uch a people: for all general corruptions, of whatever kind, begin

<P>"<HI>Secondly,</HI> A &s;till more cogent rea&s;on is, that the general body of the people have not &s;uch a <HI>bias</HI> hung upon their judgment by the prevalence of <HI>per&s;onal</HI> and <HI>particular</HI> intere&s;t, as the GREAT, in all things which relate to &s;tate matters.

<P>"Hence, then, it appears, that the united voice of an uncorrupt PEOPLE is, in general, the &s;afe&s;t te&s;t of POLITICAL GOOD AND EVIL."</P>
<P>Is it not then time to be alarmed for the public good, when great pains are taken to depreciate the people; when the names of Ja|cobin,
<PB N="130" REF="028936_0138_0FDD7578045E2618">democrat, leveller, traitor, and mover of &s;edition, are artfully thrown, by courtiers and their adherents, on every man who has &s;en&s;e and virtue enough to maintain the cau&s;e of liberty; that cau&s;e, which e&s;tabli&s;hed the revolution on the ruins of de&s;poti&s;m, and pla|ced the pre&s;ent family on the throne, as the guardians of a free con&s;titution?

<P>THE people of this land are u&s;ually divided into nobility, gentry, and <HI>commonalty.</HI> The nobility and gentry &s;eem to be e&s;timated as officers in an army; the commonalty, or the whole body of the people, as the rank and file.</P>
<P>There might be no original impropriety in the&s;e appellations; but that of <HI>commonalty</HI> has been often u&s;ed, by ari&s;tocratical up&s;tarts, with in&s;olence. The commonalty comprize the grand ma&s;s of the nation; form the great fabric of the political building; while the GENTRY, after all, are but the carving and gilding, or the
<PB N="132" REF="028936_0140_0FDD757DF7741F08">capitals of the pillars, that add to the &s;upport of the roof, but con&s;titute neither the walls nor the foundation. The commonalty, there|fore, being the main fabric, are worthy, in the eye of rea&s;on, of the highe&s;t e&s;teem, and the fir&s;t degree of a patriot's &s;olicitude. There can be no rational end in our government but the happine&s;s of the whole PEOPLE, King, Lords, and COMMONS.</P>
<P>The commonalty are, beyond all compari&s;on, the mo&s;t numerous order: and as every indi|vidual of them is entitled to comfort and &s;ecu|rity in a well regulated nation, the whole to|gether-mu&s;t demand the greate&s;t attention of the philo&s;opher, the divine, the philanthropi&s;t, of every man of &s;en&s;e, goodne&s;s of heart, and liberality. The pomp and parade, the &s;uper|fluous luxury, the vain di&s;tinctions of the FEW, &s;ink to nothing, compared, in the mind of rea|&s;onable and humane men, with the happine&s;s of the <HI>million.</HI></P>
<P>It is certainly true, that the greate&s;t in&s;tan|ces of virtue and excellence of every kind have originated in the middle order. 'Give me neither poverty nor riches,' was a prayer founded on a knowledge of human nature, and fully ju&s;tified by experience. The middle &s;tation affords the be&s;t opportunities for im|provement of mind, is the lea&s;t expo&s;ed to temptation, and the mo&s;t capable of happine&s;s and virtue.</P>
<P>This opinion has long been received and acknowledged. I could cite, from the &s;ermont
<PB N="133" REF="028936_0141_0FDD757F5F3AE368">of our be&s;t divines on <HI>Agair's Prayer,</HI> many pa&s;&s;age; in confirmation of it. I dwell upon it now, for no other rea&s;on, but becau&s;e it has <HI>lately</HI> been the fa&s;hion, among tho&s;e who are alarmed for their privileges by the French revo|lution, to run down the people, and to cry up that &s;illy &s;pirit of chivalry which e&s;tabli&s;hed the &s;y&s;tems of fal&s;e honor, claiming rank and re&s;pect from &s;ociety, without rendering it any &s;ervice, without po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing any ju&s;t claim to e&s;teem, much le&s;s to public honor, exclu&s;ive privileges, and titular di&s;tinction. The terms <HI>&s;ans culottes, canaille, bourgeoi&s;e,</HI> &s;cum of the earth, <HI>venal wretches,</HI> and the never to be forgotten <HI>&s;wini&s;h multitude,</HI> have been re&s;erved for the people, e&s;pecially tho&s;e among them who have had &s;en&s;e and &s;pirit enough per|&s;onally to oppo&s;e the progre&s;s of de&s;potic prin|ciples and practices. Every thing that malice, urged by the fear of lo&s;ing the ribands, the titles, and the &s;olid pence which a corrupt and corrupting mini&s;ter can be&s;tow, has been thrown out, in new&s;papers hited by the people's money for the purpo&s;e of vilifying the people.</P>
<P>It is time, therefore, that the people &s;hould vindicate their honor. What are the&s;e in&s;olent co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tiers, what the&s;e placemen and pen&s;ioners, who live on the public bounty, that they &s;hould thus in&s;ult tho&s;e who&s;e bread they eat? For the mo&s;t part, they are per&s;ons who, if they were &s;tripped of the fal&s;e &s;plendor of great man|&s;ions, numerous retinues, painted carriages, would appear among the meane&s;t and mo&s;t de&s;|picable
<PB N="134" REF="028936_0142_0FDD75839282C8E8">members of &s;ociety. They indeed are to be pitied and borne with, while they ab&s;tain from iu&s;ulting the people; but when their filly pride pre&s;umes to trample on the ma&s;s of the community, they become de&s;erving of contempt as well as commi&s;eration.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the per&s;ons whom a patriotic Lord de&s;cribes "as giving them&s;elves up to the pur|&s;uit of honors and dignities, as LOVING THE SPLENDOR OF A COURT, and attaching them|&s;elves to the cau&s;e of monarchy, (not from any conviction that monarchy is the mo&s;t favorable to human happine&s;s, not even from per&s;onal attachment to the monarch,) but becau&s;e they &s;ee in the <HI>increa&s;ed power</HI> of the monarch the &s;ource of additional weight and SPLENDOR to tho&s;e (that is, them&s;elves) who &s;urround the throne, and an increa&s;e of value to the favors which the &s;overeign can confer; &s;uch as &s;tars, garters, ribands, and titles."</P>
<P>But is a pa&s;&s;ion, childi&s;h from its vanity, and diabolical in its unfeeling greedine&s;s, to be borne with any longer, when, not content with engro&s;&s;ing the profits of office and the pageantry of &s;tate, it dares to &s;peak of the mid|dle and lower cla&s;&s;es, as beings &s;carcely de&s;erv|ing notice, as mere <HI>nui&s;ances</HI> when not employ|ed in the &s;ervile office of admini&s;tering to ari&s;to|cratic pride.</P>
<P>Virtue is nobility. Per&s;onal merit, u&s;eful, generous, benevolent exertion, the only honor|able di&s;tinction. The trappings which every taylor can make to clothe a poor puny mortal,
<PB N="135" REF="028936_0143_0FDD7584AF0BEE18">add no real dignity. In ages of ignorance, they might &s;trike with awe. Tho&s;e ages are no more. Nor will they ever return, notwith|&s;tanding the efforts of petty de&s;pots, (fearing the lo&s;s of tho&s;e di&s;tinctions which they know they never earned), to keep the people in the gro&s;&s;e&s;t ignorance.</P>
<P>God Almighty, who gives his &s;un to &s;hine with as much warmth and radiance on the cot|tage as on the palace, has di&s;pen&s;ed the glorious privilege of genius and virtue to the poor and middle cla&s;&s;es, with a bounty perhaps &s;eldom experienced in any of the proud pretenders to hereditary or official grandeur. Let us call to mind a few among the worthies who have adorned the ages that have elap&s;ed: Socrates; was he <HI>noble</HI> in the &s;en&s;e of a king at arms? Would he have conde&s;cended to be bedizened with ribands, and &s;tars, and garters? Cicero; was he not a <HI>novus homo?</HI> a man unconnected with patricians, and deriving his glory from the pure&s;t fountain of honor, his own genius and virtue? Demo&s;thenes would have &s;corned to owe his e&s;timation to a pedigree.</P>
<P>Who were the great reformers, to whom we of England and all Europe are indebted for emancipation from the chains of &s;uper&s;tition? ERASMUS and LUTHER; Era&s;mus, as the monks of his day objected to him, laid the egg, and Luther hatched it. But was it Archbi&s;hop Era&s;mus? Lord Luther, Marquis Luther, Sir Martin Luther? Did they, either of them, &s;eek
<PB N="136" REF="028936_0144_0FDD758645431B60">the favor of courts? Were they not among the <HI>&s;wini&s;h multitude?</HI></P>
<P>Thomas Paine contributed much, by his <HI>Common Sen&s;e,</HI> to the happy revolution in Ame|rica. I need not ob&s;erve, that he had nothing of the lu&s;tre of courts or nobility to recommend him. The virulent malice of courtiers and venal &s;cribblers has blackened him as they once blackened Luther, when they a&s;&s;erted of him, that he was actually a <HI>devil incarnate,</HI> di&s;gui&s;ed in the &s;hape of a monk with a cowl. I do not advert to any of his &s;ub&s;equent publications. I only &s;ay, if they are &s;o <HI>contemptible</HI> as they are &s;aid by courtiers and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ri&s;tocrats to be, why not undertake the <HI>ea&s;y</HI> ta&s;k of refuting him? Bloody wars and pro&s;ecutions are no refu|tation.</P>
<P>"Who is this <HI>Luther?</HI>" (&s;aid Margaret, governe&s;s of the Netherlands.) The courtiers around her replied, "He is an ILLITERATE MONK." "Is he &s;o? (&s;aid &s;he.) I am glad to hear it. Then do you, gentlemen, who are not illiterate, who are both learned and numerous, do you, I charge you, write again&s;t this <HI>illiterate monk.</HI> That is all you have to do. The bu&s;ine&s;s is ea&s;y; for the world will &s;urely pay more regard to a great many <HI>&s;cho|lars,</HI> and great men, as you are, than to one poor <HI>illiterate monk.</HI>"</P>
<P>Many did write again&s;t him, and poured forth the virulence of a malice unchecked by truth, and encouraged by crowned heads,
<PB N="137" REF="028936_0145_0FDD7587B88DFB48">But <HI>Luther</HI> prevailed, and we Engli&s;hmen have rea&s;on to celebrate the victory of truth and virtue over corrupt influence and cruel per|&s;ecution.</P>
<P>The greate&s;t &s;cholars, poets, orators, phi|lo&s;ophers, warriors, &s;tate&s;men, inventors and improvers of the arts, aro&s;e from the lowe&s;t of the people. If we had waited till courtiers had invented the art of printing, clock-making, navigation, and a thou&s;and others, we &s;hould probably have continued in darkne&s;s to this hour. They had &s;omething el&s;e to do, than to add to the comforts and conveniencies of or|dinary life. They had to wor&s;hip an idol, with the incen&s;e of flattery, who was often much more &s;tupid than them&s;elves, and who &s;ometimes had no more care or knowledge of the people under him, or their wants, than he had of arts or literature.</P>
<P>The education of the middle cla&s;&s;es is infi|nitely better than the education of tho&s;e who are called <HI>great people.</HI> Their time is le&s;s con&s;umed by that vanity and di&s;&s;ipation which enfeebles the mind, while it precludes oppor|tunity for reading and reflection.

The&s;e are their &s;tars, and the&s;e their coronets. They are for the mo&s;t part attached to their religion. They are temperate, frugal, and indu&s;trious.

<PB N="138" REF="028936_0146_0FDD758943039F28">that <HI>courts</HI> can give, they greatly excel the GREAT, and that particular is SINCERITY. They are in earne&s;t in their words and deeds.

<P>IN proportion as great men refu&s;e to &s;ubmit to rea&s;on, they are inclined to govern by violence.

<P>The diffu&s;ion of a military ta&s;te among all ranks, even the lowe&s;t of the people, tends to a general corruption of morals, by teaching habits of idlene&s;s, or trifling activity, and the vanity of guady dre&s;s and empty parade.</P>

In &s;uch a &s;tate there will be no more &s;ecurity for the tenant of a throne than of a cottage. A junto, that has no regard for either, and is &s;olely actuated by the love of power, its di&s;tinctions and emoluments may, by di&s;tributing di&s;tinctions and emoluments on <HI>many,</HI> and by rai&s;ing the hopes and expectations of <HI>more,</HI> make the ma&s;s of the people them&s;elves (thus corrupted at the very fountain-head) become the in&s;truments of annihilating the be&s;t part of the con&s;titution. A limited monarch, who&s;e throne is founded on the ba&s;is of a peo|ple's affection, and a judicious preference both of his per&s;on and form of government, will be as rea&s;onably anxious as any among the people can be, to guard again&s;t the prevalence of &s;uch corruption, and the &s;ucce&s;s of &s;uch corruptors.

<P>I firmly maintain, that the prevention of this popular degeneracy is to be effected, not by political artifices, not by pro&s;ecutions, not by &s;ycophantic a&s;&s;ociations of placemen, pen|&s;ioners, and expectants of titles and emoluments, but by reforming the manners of the people.

<P>No writings of &s;ceptical or infidel philo&s;o|phers do &s;o much harm to chri&s;tian faith and practice, to religion and morality, as the u&s;ing of CHURCH <HI>revenues</HI> and CHURCH <HI>in&s;truction</HI> as in&s;truments of court corruption.

<P>It is certainly in the power of a well regu|lated government, by rendering the CHURCH effective, and by good examples and &s;incere attachment to virtuous men and virtuous prin|ciples, to correct the levity, effeminacy, and
<PB N="152" REF="028936_0160_0FDD75B326C673E0">want of principle in private life, which leads to the lo&s;s of liberty.

<P>"And if the great principles of religion, honor, and public &s;pirit are weak or lo&s;t among us, what effectual check can there be upon the GREAT, to control their unwarranted pur&s;uit of LUCRATIVE EMPLOYMENTS, for the grati|fication of the&s;e unmanly pa&s;&s;ions?</P>
<P>"In a nation &s;o circum&s;tanced, it is natural to imagine that, next to GAMING and RIOT, the <HI>chief attention</HI> of the GREAT WORLD mu&s;t be turned on the bu&s;ine&s;s of ELECTION JOB|BING, of SECURING COUNTIES, controling, bribing or BUYING BOROUGHS; in a word, on the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a great parliamentary intere&s;t.</P>
<P>"But what an aggravation of this evil would ari&s;e, &s;hould ever tho&s;e of the <HI>highe&s;t rank,</HI> though PROHIBITED BY ACT OF PAR|LIAMENT, in&s;ult the laws, by interfering in elections, by &s;oliciting votes, or procuring others to &s;olicit them, by influencing elections in an avowed defiance of their country, and

<P>Would not this be TREASON <HI>again&s;t the con&s;titution?</HI> a more dangerous and heinous political crime than any that have been pro&s;e|cuted by attornies-general? Does not this directly de&s;troy the democratical part of the &s;y&s;tem, and e&s;tabli&s;h a power, independent both of the monarch and the people? Are not <HI>both,</HI> therefore, intere&s;ted in putting a &s;top to &s;uch gro&s;s violations of law and equity?</P>
<P>"What (continues Dr. Brown) can we &s;up|po&s;e would be the real drift of this illegitimate wa&s;te (among the GREAT) of time, honors, wealth, and labor? Might not the very rea&s;on publicly a&s;&s;igned for it be this: 'that they may &s;trengthen them&s;elves and families, and thus gain a la&s;ting intere&s;t (as they call it) for their dependents, &s;ons, and po&s;teri|ty?'&mdash;Now, what would this imply but a &s;uppo&s;ed <HI>right or privilege</HI> of DEMANDING LUCRATIVE EMPLOYS, as the chief object of their views?&mdash;We &s;ee then, how the political &s;y&s;tem of &s;elf-intere&s;t is at length completed.</P>
<P>"Thus faction is e&s;tabli&s;hed, not on ambi|tion, but on AVARICE: on AVAIRCE and RAPACITY, for the ends of DISSIPATION.</P>
<P>"The great contention among tho&s;e of family and fortune, will be in the affair of ELECTION INTEREST: next to effeminate plea&s;ure and <HI>gaming;</HI> this (for the &s;ame end as gaming) will of cour&s;e be the capital pur&s;uit; this intere&s;t will naturally be regarded as a
<PB N="158" REF="028936_0166_0FDD75C786C48370">kind of <HI>family fund,</HI> for the provi&s;ion of the younger branches.</P>
<P>"In a nation &s;o circum&s;tanced, many high and important po&s;ts, in every public and im|portant profe&s;&s;ion, mu&s;t of cour&s;e be filled by men, who, in&s;tead of <HI>ability</HI> and <HI>virtue,</HI> plead this <HI>intere&s;t</HI> (in elections) for their BEST TI|TLE.</P>
<P>"Thus, in a time when &s;cience, capacity, courage, honor, religion, public &s;pirit are rare, the remaining FEW who po&s;&s;e&s;s the&s;e virtues, will often be <HI>&s;hut out</HI> from the&s;e &s;tations, which they would fill with honor; while every public and important employ will abound with men, who&s;e manners and principles are of the <HI>newe&s;t</HI> fa&s;hion.</P>
<P>"Is not the <HI>parliamentary intere&s;t</HI> of every powerful family continually rung in the ears of its branches and dependents? And does not this inevitably tend to relax and weaken the application of the <HI>young men</HI> of quality and fortune, and render every man, who has reli|ance on this principle, <HI>le&s;s qualified</HI> for tho&s;e very &s;tations, which by this very principle he obtains.

<P>"Where effeminacy and &s;elfi&s;h vanity form the ruling character of a people, then tho&s;e of
<PB N="159" REF="028936_0167_0FDD75CCA03F1C98"><HI>high rank</HI> will be of all others mo&s;t vain, mo&s;t &s;elfi&s;h, mo&s;t incapable, mo&s;t effeminate.</P>
<P>"Such are the effects of the prevailing principle of &s;elf-intere&s;t in <HI>high life.</HI> But if we take into the account all that <HI>de&s;picable train</HI> of political managers, agents, and borough|jobbers, which hang like <HI>leeches</HI> upon the GREAT, nor ever quit their hold till they are full gorged, we &s;hall then &s;ee this reigning evil in its la&s;t perfection. For here, to <HI>inca|pacity</HI> and <HI>demerit,</HI> is generally added INSO|LENCE. Every low fellow of this kind looks upon the man of genius, capacity, and virtue, as his <HI>natural enemy.</HI> He regards him with an evil eye; and hence <HI>undermines</HI> or defames him; as one who thwarts his views, que&s;tions his title, and endangers his <HI>expectations.</HI>"</P>
<P>In another place, the fame author very plainly deduces the corruption of the <HI>youth of the nation,</HI> the young nobility and gentry in particular, from <HI>parliamentary corruption.</HI></P>
<P>"Notwith&s;tanding the privilege ve&s;ted in the commons of commanding the pur&s;es of their con&s;tituents, it is not difficult to point out a &s;ituation, where this privilege would be nothing but a <HI>name.</HI> And as in the la&s;t century the regal and democratic branches by turns bore down the con&s;titution, &s;o, in &s;uch a &s;ituation as is here &s;uppo&s;ed, the real danger, though hidden, would lurk in the <HI>ari&s;tocratic</HI> branch, which would be &s;ecretly bearing down the power both of the king and the people.</P>
<P>"The matter may be explained in a &s;mall
<PB N="160" REF="028936_0168_0FDD75CD864B01F8">compa&s;s. Cannot we put a ca&s;e, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> which the <HI>parliamentary intere&s;t</HI> of the <HI>great nobility</HI> might &s;wallow up the hou&s;e of commons? Members might be elected, indeed; and elec|ted in <HI>form</HI> too. But by whom might they be <HI>really</HI> elected? By the free voice of the people? No impartial man would &s;ay it. It were ea&s;y to &s;uppo&s;e thirty or forty men, who, if wanted, might go nigh to command a majo|rity in the lower hou&s;e. The members might <HI>&s;eem</HI> to be the repre&s;entatives of the people; but would be, in truth, a great part of them, no more than the <HI>commi&s;&s;ioned deputies</HI> of their re&s;pective <HI>chiefs,</HI> who&s;e &s;entiments they would give, and who&s;e <HI>intere&s;ts</HI> they would pur&s;ue.</P>
<P>"Thus, while power would, in appearance, be centering in the lower hou&s;e, it would in reality be lurking in the higher.</P>
<P>"This &s;tate of things might not perhaps re&s;ult from any de&s;ign in the ari&s;tocratic branch to de&s;troy the con&s;titution.

Let us con&s;ider the mo&s;t probable effects.</P>
<P>"The fir&s;t fatal effect which offers it&s;elf to ob&s;ervation is, that the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of &s;uch an increa&s;ing and exorbitant power, which the lords might acquire in the hou&s;e of commons, would de&s;troy all <HI>hone&s;t ambition</HI> in the <HI>younger gentry.</HI> They would know, that the utmo&s;t point they could hope to arrive at would only

The few men of ability and &s;pirit that might be left, &s;eeing this to be the ca&s;e, would naturally betake them&s;elves to &s;uch <HI>private amu&s;ements</HI> as a free mind can hone&s;tly enjoy. All <HI>hope,</HI> and therefore, by degrees, all <HI>de&s;ire</HI> of &s;erving their country, would be extingui&s;hed.</P>
<P>"Thus HONEST ambition would naturally and generally be quenched. But even where am|bition <HI>continued,</HI> it would be <HI>perverted.</HI> Not u&s;eful, but <HI>&s;ervile</HI> talents would be applauded; and the ruling pride would be, not that of free|men, but of &s;laves."</P>
<P>The above remarks were made long before American independence was e&s;tabli&s;hed, the French revolution thought of, or the di&s;cu&s;|&s;ions on the &s;ubject of parliamentary reform became general. The author wrote the pure re&s;ult of impartial ob&s;ervation; and what he wrote de&s;erves the &s;erious attention of all HONEST <HI>men,</HI> all good members of the commu|nity. I will make no comments upon it, but leave it to operate on the mind with its own force.</P>

<P>If the men of Bridgwater, urged perhaps by want, were <HI>venal wretches,</HI> what mu&s;t we think of the Duke of Newca&s;tle and Lord Melcombe? I hope my reader will pau&s;e, and ponder the words of the preceding pa&s;&s;age.

<P>Lord Melcombe's Diary was much read when it fir&s;t came out; but it has &s;ince fallen into neglect. Events, however, have happen|ed in the political world, which render it ex|tremely intere&s;ting at the pre&s;ent period. In con&s;equence of the French revolution, much pains have been taken to decry the people, and extol the ari&s;tocratical part of &s;ociety. The tide has run wonderfully, in con&s;equence of <HI>fal&s;e alarms</HI> and mini&s;terial artifices, in favor of courts and courtiers. The people have been called, not only <HI>venal wretches,</HI> but the &s;wini&s;h multitude. Long and tire&s;ome books have been written to run down the people, as de&s;titute of virtue, principle, of every thing hone&s;t and honorable, and that can give them any right to interfere with the grand my&s;teries of a cabi|net. But he who reads and con&s;iders duly the very &s;triking anecdotes and conver&s;ations in Lord Melcombe's Diary, will &s;ee, that, in order to find venality in its full growth, and &s;urvey &s;ordidne&s;s in its complete &s;tate of abomi|nation, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to turn from low to high life.</P>
<P>The people are often turbulent and indi&s;|creet in their tran&s;actions, but they are always hone&s;t and always generous. They feel &s;trongly for the cau&s;e of humanity and ju&s;tice. They have a noble &s;pirit, which leads them to view meanne&s;s and &s;ini&s;ter conduct with dete&s;tation.
<PB N="168" REF="028936_0176_0FDD75E0EE90AF50">But is there any of this manly independence, this hone&s;t openne&s;s, this regard for the rights and happine&s;s of man, among tho&s;e whom Lord Melcombe, &s;o unfortunately for the great vulgar, has introduced to public notice? There is all the deceit in his own character, which would denominate a man a &s;windler in the com|mercial walks of life. All the tran&s;actions of the junto are conducted with the timidity, &s;ecrecy, duplicity of a ne&s;t of thieves, mutu|ally fearing and fawning, while they hate and de&s;pi&s;e each other from their heart's core.</P>
<P>On the practice of purcha&s;ing votes in bo|roughs, by bartering the cure of &s;ouls, the mo&s;t &s;acred charge, if there be any thing &s;acred in human affairs, I &s;hall expatiate more at large in a future Section.</P>
<P>This Bubb Doddington, after &s;elling him&s;elf, betraying the prince, and offering his &s;ix mem|bers to the be&s;t bidder, was made a lord. He was created Baron of Melcombe Regis, as a reward for &s;uch pro&s;titution of principles as ought to have cau&s;ed him to be branded in the forehead with a mark of indelible infamy.</P>
<P>But can we &s;uppo&s;e that there has been but one Bubb Doddington in this country? one Newca&s;tle? I wi&s;h the &s;uppo&s;ition were founded in probability. It would be the &s;implicity of idioti&s;m to &s;uppo&s;e, that Bubb Doddington has not exhibited in his Diary a picture of para&s;iti|cal courtiers, in all times and countries, where corruption is the main principle of admini&s;tra|tion.</P>

If <HI>&s;uch men</HI> &s;hould, in any country of Europe, influence the councils of princes, and manage the popular a&s;&s;emblies, would there not be rea&s;on to be alarmed for the be&s;t con&s;titution ever devi&s;ed by human wi&s;dom? <HI>Such men</HI> hate the people.

They have a kind of claim, in their own opinion, to court favor; e&s;pecially as they are ready to u&s;e the influence, which their riches give them, in &s;upport of any mini&s;ter for the time being, and in the general exten&s;ion of royal prerogative. Are &s;uch men likely to be independent members of a &s;enate, hone&s;tly following the dictates of their judgment or con&s;cience, and con&s;ulting no intere&s;t but that of MAN in general, and the people in par|ticular, by whom they are deputed? There are no men <HI>greedier</HI> of gain than &s;uch men, and none more attached to tho&s;e vain honors, which a mini&s;ter be&s;tows in order to facilitate the move|ments of his political machine. None will rake

<P>But what is it to me, as an <HI>elector,</HI> that the man who &s;olicits my vote has, by great cun|ning, &s;ordid arts, and in&s;atiable avarice, ac|cumulated great riches? Has wi&s;dom, has vir|tue, has knowledge, has philanthropy increa&s;|ed with his increa&s;ing fortune? Uncommon &s;ucce&s;s, enormous wealth, acquired in the &s;hort &s;pace of half a human life, is a <HI>pre&s;ump|tive</HI> evidence of <HI>little principle</HI> in the means of acquiring, and as little genero&s;ity in the modes of giving or expending it. Perhaps he <HI>inherits</HI> his unbounded riches. What then? His <HI>an|ce&s;tors</HI> were probably knaves or muck-worms. In this ca&s;e, he has not to plead the merit of indu&s;try. His ance&s;tors have left him va&s;t &s;ums of money; when perhaps his own talents would &s;carcely have earned him a penny, or kept him out of the pari&s;h poor-hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s, becau&s;e he is rich, though to|tally de&s;titute of parts and virtue, he &s;tands for|ward boldly as a candidate to repre&s;ent a city or a county. He finds thou&s;ands ready to cla|mour on his &s;ide, and to give him their vote. He can treat bountifully, open hou&s;es, and give away ribands plentifully. Therefore he is con&s;tituted a &s;enator, a national coun&s;ellor,
<PB N="172" REF="028936_0180_0FDD75E9FAFC4BC8">commi&s;&s;ioned to vote away the people's money, and to decide on the mo&s;t important que&s;tions of con&s;titutional liberty.</P>
<P>What can he do but put him&s;elf into har|ne&s;s, and be driven his daily &s;tage, by the po|litical coachman, the prime mini&s;ter? He can|not go alone. He has not &s;en&s;e enough to judge for him&s;elf in the &s;malle&s;t difficulty. He has not &s;pirit enough to pre&s;erve his indepen|dence; therefore he will con&s;ider him&s;elf merely as a puppet, to be moved by the higher pow|ers, at their will; a &s;top-gap, to fill up a place which might be occupied by an abler member, who&s;e virtues and talents might &s;erve the public indeed, but would render him trou|ble&s;ome to tho&s;e who gladly di&s;pen&s;e with all virtuous interference.</P>
<P>Let us &s;uppo&s;e, for argument &s;ake, four &s;uch <HI>poor</HI> creatures (&s;uch I call them, though <HI>rich</HI> in gold) cho&s;en to repre&s;ent the city of London, the grand emporium of the world, and, from the number of its inhabitants, claim|ing a fuller repre&s;entation than any part of the nation. I own the &s;uppo&s;ition is mo&s;t di&s;grace|ful; for it can never happen, one would think, that &s;uch a city &s;hould not &s;upply men of the fir&s;t <HI>abilities,</HI> for a tru&s;t &s;o important and &s;o honorable. But let us &s;uppo&s;e the CITY, from a &s;y&s;tem of manners favored by, and favorable to, mini&s;terial corruption, &s;o far degraded as to choo&s;e four men of very moderate abilities and characters, merely becau&s;e they happen to be rich contractors, and of &s;ycophantic di&s;po|&s;itions,
<PB N="173" REF="028936_0181_0FDD75EBD4DAD630">likely to pur&s;ue their <HI>own</HI> intere&s;t by &s;ervilely obeying the beck of a mini&s;ter.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e them once in for &s;even years. The taverns are now &s;hut up, the <HI>adverti&s;ements,</HI> the canva&s;&s;ing all forgotten, and they commence as arrant courtiers as the meane&s;t tool of power, <HI>put,</HI> by a paltry lord, into a rotten borough of Su&s;&s;ex, Wilt&s;hire, or Cornwall.</P>
<P>But mark the mi&s;chief. As they nominally repre&s;ent the fir&s;t city in the world, the mea|&s;ures which <HI>they</HI> vote for, (becau&s;e they are bidden, and hope for contracts and baronet|ages), are &s;uppo&s;ed, by foreigners at lea&s;t, to have the concurrence of the mo&s;t important part of the Briti&s;h empire. Though the mi|ni&s;ter may de&s;pi&s;e them from his heart, per|&s;onally, yet he avails him&s;elf of that weight which the place they repre&s;ent gives them in the eyes of &s;trangers. "The GREAT <HI>city</HI> is <HI>with</HI> him," (in the only place he pretends to know it, the hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives).</P>
<P>Their ignorance, their meanne&s;s, and their &s;ycophancy, have another effect, highly inju|rious to all plans of con&s;titutional reformation. "Here (&s;ays the courtier) are four men &s;ent by the fir&s;t city in the world. Are they better &s;enators, or more re&s;pectable men, than tho&s;e who are &s;ent from Old Sarum, or any of the boroughs inhabited by beggars, and purcha&s;ed by lords, as a lucrative &s;peculation?" The probability is, (he will &s;ay of them), that, with more <HI>greedine&s;s after gain,</HI> from the &s;or|did habits of their youth, they have le&s;s of the
<PB N="174" REF="028936_0182_0FDD75EBDA606548">accompli&s;hments and liberality of gentlemen. Their eagerne&s;s to rai&s;e their families, renders them more tractable tools in the hands of a &s;kilful mini&s;ter, than tho&s;e who&s;e families are already rai&s;ed, and who, however they may place them&s;elves under the guidance of the peerage, have had an education which ought to have given them enlarged minds and &s;enti|ments of honor.</P>
<P>Thus the friend to de&s;potic principles, and the oppo&s;er of parliamentary reform, draws an argument from the meanne&s;s of rich men, (&s;ent by <HI>great cities</HI> to parliament merely becau&s;e they are rich), again&s;t all improvement of the repre&s;entation. The boroughs, he alleges, &s;end at lea&s;t <HI>gentlemen,</HI> and well-informed men, though in circum&s;tances comparatively indigent; whereas the&s;e great commercial bodies, placing all excellence in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;uperior wealth, depute men as &s;enators, who are unqualified for any department beyond the warehou&s;e or the counting-hou&s;e, who&s;e views are confined, and purpo&s;es <HI>habitually</HI> &s;ordid and felfi&s;h. He urges, that, from the &s;pecimens afforded by great cities, there is no rea&s;on to conclude, that the exten&s;ion of the right of &s;uffrage would render the repre&s;entative body more virtuous or enlightened. He doubts whether it would be favorable to liberty. If great bodies depute men only for their property, &s;ince they who <HI>have</HI> mo&s;t u&s;ually <HI>want</HI> mo&s;t, none will be rea|dier to &s;ell them&s;elves and their con&s;tituents to a mini&s;ter, for a feather or &s;ugar-plumb, than
<PB N="175" REF="028936_0183_0FDD75EBEA44E470">the repre&s;entatives of great bodies, delegated to parliament merely becau&s;e they have inhe|rited or acquired <HI>exce&s;&s;ive riches,</HI> with &s;carcely any ideas beyond the multiplication-table.</P>
<P>Men deputed to parliament, &s;hould certainly be far above want; but I contend that riches, independent of per&s;onal merit, can never be a &s;ufficient recommendation. It is the mo&s;t im|portant tru&s;t that can be repo&s;ed in man. It requires a mo&s;t comprehen&s;ive education, &s;trong natural abilities, and, what is greater than all, a ju&s;t, hone&s;t, upright heart, with a manly firmne&s;s, and an enlarged philanthropy.</P>
<P>Can there be any difficulty in finding, at any time, four men of &s;uch character in the city of London, or two &s;uch in any county of England? Certainly not; e&s;pecially when the corrupting idea &s;hall be exploded, that PRO|PERTY is the be&s;t qualification of a national coun&s;ellor and law-giver. <HI>Able</HI> and <HI>hone&s;t</HI> men are not the mo&s;t inclined to thru&s;t them&s;elves forward, and to <HI>obtrude</HI> them&s;elves, much le&s;s to enter into competition, when all the influence of riches and mini&s;terial favor will be exerted to traduce their character, to fru&s;trate their endeavors, and &s;end them back to private li&s;e with their fortunes injured, and their tranquil|lity di&s;turbed. The electors mu&s;t <HI>&s;earch</HI> for &s;uch men, and draw them from their virtuous ob&s;curity. Thus honored, they will go into the &s;enate with the pure motives of &s;erving their country and mankind, and return with
<PB N="176" REF="028936_0184_0FDD75F0CC832FA0"><HI>clean hands,</HI> &s;ufficiently rewarded by the ble&s;|&s;ings of the people.</P>
<P>The city of London, and all great cities, as well as counties, are to be mo&s;t &s;eriou&s;ly ex|horted to con&s;ider the importance of the tru&s;t they delegate at an election, and to choo&s;e men of known abilities, and experienced attach|ment to the cau&s;e of the people. They &s;hould beware of men, however opulent and re&s;pect|able in private life, who can have no other motive for obtruding on public life, for which they are <HI>unqualified,</HI> but to rai&s;e them&s;elves, and families to fortune and di&s;tinction, by <HI>&s;el|ling their tru&s;t</HI> to a mini&s;ter. Such men can never be friends to liberty and the people. They contribute, by means of their property, to the general &s;y&s;tem of corruption, and, per|haps without knowing it, (for they <HI>know</HI> but little), promote, mo&s;t effectually, the &s;pirit of de&s;poti&s;m.</P>

<P>THE rottenne&s;s of corruption, ori|ginating from mini&s;ters, intoxicated with the love of power, and greedy after the emolu|ments of office, is &s;ometimes found (e&s;pecially under the influence of <HI>fal&s;e alarms</HI>) to pervade the whole ma&s;s of the people, and to infect the very heart of the body politic. The vitals of liberty become tainted, and, without great efforts, a <HI>mortification</HI> may be ju&s;tly appre|hended.</P>
<P>In this corrupt &s;tate, <HI>little de&s;pots,</HI> a&s;piring at court favor, hoping to draw the notice of the mini&s;ter on their faithful endeavors to &s;erve him, ari&s;e in almo&s;t every town and village of the country, and in every &s;treet of a great city. They claim and exerci&s;e a juri&s;diction over cer|tain VASSALS, as they think them, their trade&s;|men, their tenants, and all others, who derive
<PB N="178" REF="028936_0186_0FDD75FBD8360B38">emoluments from them in the way of their bu&s;ine&s;s, or expect their cu&s;tom and counte|nance. If the VASSALS pre&s;ume to act for them&s;elves as MEN and freemen, they lo&s;e their bu&s;ine&s;s, their dwelling places, their farms, and all chance of acquiring a competency. The vengeance of the <HI>little de&s;pots</HI> pur&s;ues them; and frequently quits not the chace, till it has hunted them down to de&s;truction.</P>
<P>Even in the CITY OF LONDON, opulent as it is, and <HI>independent</HI> as it might be, a city which u&s;ed to be the fir&s;t to &s;tand up in defence of liberty, an overbearing influence can find its way to the ob&s;cure&s;t di&s;trict, and in&s;inuate it&s;elf into the blinde&s;t alley. The <HI>Great Merchant or Manufacturer,</HI> who is nece&s;&s;arily connected with many &s;ubordinate traders or workmen, con&s;iders the influence he gains from exten&s;ive connections in bu&s;ine&s;s, as a very valuable and vendible commodity at the <HI>market</HI> of a <HI>mini&s;ter.</HI> Naturally wi&s;hing to make the mo&s;t of his trade, he re&s;olves to treat this connection as a part of his <HI>&s;tock,</HI> and cau&s;e it to bring him an <HI>ample</HI> return. At lea&s;t he will <HI>adventure.</HI> It may be a prize to him, as it has been to many. Much depends on his own prudential management of the com|modity. It may lead to a valuable <HI>contract,</HI> e&s;pecially if kind fortune &s;hould kindle the flames of war; it may open the path to court favors of various kinds; it may ultimately con|fer a &s;eat in the hou&s;e, and perhaps a baronet|tage. This la&s;t honor is highly de&s;irable, as it removes at once the FILTH that naturally
<PB N="179" REF="028936_0187_0FDD75052F459FA0">attaches to the very name of <HI>citizen, dealer</HI> and <HI>chapman.</HI></P>
<P>In the city of London, the majority of <HI>electors,</HI> who &s;end the <HI>few</HI> members of parliament allot|ted to it, are of the <HI>middle,</HI> and indeed of the inferior rank of &s;hopkeepers, rarely ri&s;ing to the dignity of MERCHANTS, who re&s;ide at the hou&s;es with <HI>great gates,</HI> or rather in the <HI>new &s;quares,</HI> two or three miles north-we&s;t of the polluted and polluting <HI>city:</HI> for &s;uch is the in&s;olence of little city DESPOTS who are in a very <HI>great way,</HI> that they commonly <HI>de&s;pi&s;e</HI> the <HI>freedom</HI> of the city where their counting-hou&s;e &s;tands, and where they gain their plumbs. They do not <HI>conde&s;cend</HI> to be FREE of the city. They would con&s;ider it as a degradation from their <HI>gentility</HI> to be LIVERYMEN and members of a city company. Liverymen, indeed! What! <HI>great men,</HI> as <HI>all</HI> BANKERS are, <HI>Ea&s;t India Directors,</HI> u&s;urious <HI>money-lenders,</HI> living magnificently in Portland-place or Portman|&s;quare, or the grand avenues to them, to be LIVERYMEN! Horrid degradation! The very idea is &s;hocking to the <HI>&s;pirit of de&s;poti&s;m.</HI> It is time enough to take up their FREEDOM of the city, when it is nece&s;&s;ary, as candidates, to po&s;&s;e&s;s that qualification. There are too <HI>many votes</HI> to make it <HI>worth while</HI> to be a voter. The&s;e <HI>great</HI> men, therefore, view the electors as &s;ubordinate per&s;ons, whom they may &s;end on an errand to Guildhall to VOTE for the mini&s;ter's candidate, ju&s;t as they would di&s;patch a clerk or porter to the Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e to take
<PB N="180" REF="028936_0188_0FDD75FF1B5CE5E8">a Cu&s;tom-hou&s;e-oath, or to do any JOB con|nected with the <HI>low</HI> trade or manufacture which enables them to a&s;&s;ociate with the fine folk of St. James's.</P>
<P>The <HI>elector</HI> who goes to the hu&s;tings <HI>mu&s;t,</HI> indeed, vote upon his <HI>oath,</HI> that he <HI>has</HI> received and <HI>will</HI> receive no BRIBE. He does not con|&s;ider the lucrative employments and the emo|luments ari&s;ing from the <HI>great man</HI>'s cu&s;tom, which would be lo&s;t on <HI>di&s;obedience,</HI> as a <HI>bribe,</HI> and therefore votes again&s;t his judgment, con|&s;cience, and inclination, without a murmur; e&s;pecially as his daily bread may perhaps de|pend on his ob&s;equiou&s;ne&s;s, and very likely the comfort and &s;ecurity of a wife and large family.</P>
<P>This conduct of the GREAT MEN is not only uncon&s;titutional and affronting to the city, but as truly DESPOTIC in principle as any thing done by the Grand Seignior. It is <HI>mean</HI> al&s;o and ba&s;e to the la&s;t degree; for the great men u&s;ually exert not their influence from friend&s;hip to the mini&s;ter, or to a candidate, or from any regard to a cau&s;e which they think connected with the public good; but &s;olely to &s;erve them|&s;elves, to provide for poor relations, to enrich or to aggrandize an up&s;tart family, already ren|dered contemptible by fungous pride.</P>
<P>The glorious rights and privileges of Eng|li&s;hmen, of which we read and hear &s;o much, are then to be all &s;acrificed to &s;erve a man, who perhaps went out as a <HI>writer</HI> to the Ea&s;t In|dies, and returned in five or &s;ix years, laden with riches; the injured widow and orphan in

<PB N="186" REF="028936_0194_0FDD76110465D2F0">amu&s;e and delude the people with the trappings of royalty. Popery prevailed more by the gaudine&s;s of its prie&s;ts and altars, and the pomp of its proce&s;&s;ions, than from the progre&s;s of conviction. The people, in &s;uch circum&s;tances, have indeed the plea&s;ure of fine &s;ights; but they u&s;ually pay much more dearly for them than for exhibitions at the theatre; and have this mortifying reflection, as a drawback from their plea&s;ure, that the payment is involuntary, and the &s;ight a political delu&s;ion. It in&s;ults their under&s;tandings, while it beguiles them of their rights; and takes from them the earnings of their indu&s;try, while it teaches them to feel their own in&s;ignificance.</P>
<P>But not only de&s;pots, courtiers, and public functionaries, think it proper to &s;trike the vul|gar with awe, by purcha&s;ing finery of the builder, the taylor, and the coach-painter; but the titled and the overgrown rich men, through every part of every community, where family aggrandizement is procurable without public &s;ervices, or private or per&s;onal virtue. Riches, in &s;uch &s;ocieties, confer not only the means of luxurious enjoyment, but of civil &s;uperiority. They a&s;&s;ume a value not naturally their own, and become the <HI>&s;uccedanea</HI> of wi&s;|dom, patrioti&s;m, valor, learning, and benefi|cence. The great object is therefore to make an o&s;tentation of riches, and to keep the peo|ple at a di&s;tance, by dazzling their eyes with the blaze of equipage and magnificence. As all the minuter luminaries gravitate to the &s;un
<PB N="187" REF="028936_0195_0FDD7614F0CE4340">in our &s;olar &s;y&s;tem, &s;o all the&s;e a&s;pirants at di&s;tinction and &s;uperior importance gravitate to royalty. The crown is the glittering orb round which they ambitiou&s;ly revolve. They would all therefore contribute, if they were able, to add new brilliancy, new heat, new influence and powers of attraction to their fountain of glory. They turn to it as the &s;un-flower to the &s;un; and feel their colors brighter, and their leaves invigorated, when a ray of favor falls upon them in a peculiar direction. They can|not turn a moment to the people. The popular climate chills them. The gales from this quarter are as the icy breezes from the frozen regions of the north, where the genial beams of &s;olar influence can &s;carcely penetrate.</P>
<P>It may then be fairly pre&s;umed, that where all orders of the rich are vying with each other to make a &s;plendid appearance, even above their rank and means of &s;upport, the &s;pirit of the times, among the&s;e orders at lea&s;t, is favorable to the increa&s;e of court influence, and there|fore to the &s;pirit of de&s;poti&s;m.</P>
<P>This rivalry in &s;plendor is, in cour&s;e, attend|ed with great expence; an expence, which, by reducing independent fortunes, dimini&s;hes independence of &s;pirit. They who are ruined in &s;econding the purpo&s;es of a court, naturally think them&s;elves entitle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> to indemnity from court favor. They become then, merely tools of the mini&s;ter, and dare not &s;peak or act, in any in&s;tance, again&s;t him, le&s;t they renounce

<P>Thus the rage for out&s;hining others in exter|nals, contributes to ruin both fortune and prin|ciple. Add to this, that the prevalence of pageantry erects, in &s;ociety, a fal&s;e &s;tandard of human excellence. Money becomes the deity. Money is to give con&s;equence, con&s;ideration, power.

How mu&s;t the human mind &s;ink in &s;uch a conjuncture! Its noble&s;t energies cannot give it that e&s;timation with mankind, which money, inherited by a fool, or acquired by a knave, boldly claims and obtains.

Chains of gold and &s;ilver are no le&s;s galling than fetters of iron.</P>
<P>Pageantry has contributed perhaps more than any other cau&s;e to the prevalence of war, the bane of happine&s;s, the di&s;grace of human nature. The grand operations of war, the &s;plendor of arms, the finery of military dre&s;s, have been the amu&s;ements which de&s;pots have
<PB N="190" REF="028936_0198_0FDD771B2B180350">chiefly delighted in, whenever they could behold them in perfect con&s;i&s;tence with their own per&s;onal &s;afety. The pageantry of war dazzles young minds, and &s;upplies both armies and navies with willing victims. The ugline&s;s of &s;laughter, the de&s;olation of fertile plains, the burning of peaceful villages, have all been unnoticed, amid the <HI>pride, pomp, and circum|&s;tance of glorious war.</HI> The ta&s;te for fal&s;e glare and deceitful appearances of happine&s;s and glory, has then been one of the mo&s;t prolific parents of human calamity. It has palliated robbery, and covered foul murder with a glit|tering veil of tin&s;el.</P>
<P>All impo&s;ture is ultimately productive of evil. Pageantry, in a wretched world like this, a&s;&s;umed by infirm mortals doomed &s;hortly to die, cannot but be deceitful. Its object is to put off fal&s;e and counterfeit goods for true, There is nothing in human affairs that will ju&s;|tify or &s;upport that glare of happine&s;s which the pageantry of the rich and great &s;eek to di&s;play. The ma&s;k is too &s;mall and too tran&s;parent to conceal the face of woe, the wrinkles of decay and imperfection. In times of great ignorance, when &s;carcely any could read, and very little communication was pre&s;erved among the dif|ferent orders of &s;ociety, the mummery of courts and courtiers taught the vulgar to believe that the internal organization of beings, &s;o deco|rated externally, mu&s;t be of a &s;uperior nature. Princes and prie&s;ts dre&s;&s;ed them&s;elves in gro|te&s;que garbs, in a kind of ma&s;querade habit, to
<PB N="191" REF="028936_0199_0FDD761BD756A3D0">carry on the delu&s;ion. But the reign of great wigs, fur gowns, hoods, and cloaks, is nearly at its clo&s;e. Gilded coaches, hor&s;es richly capari&s;oned, gaudy hammer-cloths, fine foot|men, endeavor to &s;upply their place; but they have lo&s;t much of their influence; and at la&s;t it will be found, that to obtain the re&s;pect of the people, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to de&s;erve it. No longer will the public admire the poor crea|ture who rides <HI>within</HI> the coach, for a &s;plendor which he owes entirely to the manufacturer of carriages, the painter, the carver, the gilder, the harne&s;s-maker, the hor&s;e-dealer, and the groom.

<P>The pageantry di&s;played by contractors, by placemen, by pen&s;ioners, by commi&s;&s;aries, by all who fatten on the public &s;poils, may ju&s;tly be con&s;idered as an in&s;ult on the people. In times of great pro&s;perity it might be winked at; but in times of di&s;tre&s;s and adver&s;ity, it is offen&s;ive. It an&s;wers no good end.

<P>A due degree of &s;elf-re&s;pect, a dignified behaviour, a demand of what is due to one|&s;elf, attended with a cheerful payment of what is due to others, are highly laudable, and have no connection with that &s;en&s;ele&s;s, &s;ullen, cruel pride, which marks the &s;pirit of de&s;poti&s;m.</P>
<P>This latter fort of pride is totally de&s;titute of feeling for others. It &s;carcely acknowledges the common tie of humanity.

Per&s;ons thus rai&s;ed to civil honors, thus enriched by the long-continued favor of courts, would willingly depreciate all dignity which is derived from GOD and virtue only, unindebted to patents royal. They would create an artifi|cial preference to a di&s;tingui&s;hed few among the human race, which nature is for ever coun|teracting, by giving &s;uperior abilities to tho&s;e who are pu&s;hed down among the de&s;pi&s;ed and neglected many. This conduct is both unju&s;t and unnatural. It cannot be favorable to human happine&s;s, becau&s;e it is adver&s;e to truth, and does violence to the will of God mani|fe&s;ted in the operations of nature. In France it was carried to that extreme which brought it to its termination. There is a tendency to carry it to extremes in all countries where courts predominate. The friend of rea&s;on and of man will therefore endeavor to convince the people, that an ari&s;tocracy, founded on caprice or accident only, without any regard to &s;uperior abilities and virtues, is a fertile cau&s;e of <HI>war,</HI> and all tho&s;e evils which infe&s;t a great part of civil &s;ociety.</P>

<P>THERE is no doctrine &s;o ab&s;urd but pride and &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s will adopt and main|tain it with ob&s;tinacy, if it be conducive to their gratification. Alexander, it is &s;aid, <HI>really</HI> be|lieved him&s;elf a god. The vile&s;t of the Cae&s;ars demanded divine honors. Many in&s;tances are on record of wretched beings, with hardly any thing worthy of <HI>man</HI> about them, forgetting, in con&s;equence of a little elevation above others, that they were mortals; behaving with the wickedne&s;s and cruelty of devils, and at the &s;ame time arrogating the power and dignity of the cele&s;tial nature. It is related of Hanno, the Carthaginian, that he taught &s;tarlings to &s;ay "<HI>Deus Hanno</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hanno is a God.</NOTE>;" and that when a very large number had learned their le&s;&s;on, he turn|ed them loo&s;e into the woods, hoping that they would teach the wild bea&s;ts on the trees to re|peat the &s;ame words, and that thus the divinity of Hanno might be wafted into the remote&s;t regions, and become the wor&s;hip of the uni|ver&s;e. Such conduct appears to re&s;emble the
<PB N="217" REF="028936_0225_0FDD7662EADBA248">the ravings of the poor lunatic, who crowns him&s;elf, as he &s;its in his de&s;olate cell, with a crown of &s;traw, and imagines, while he &s;ways a &s;ceptre of the &s;ame materials, that he is an emperor. But in truth, the pride of de&s;pots, I mean tho&s;e who have all the di&s;po&s;itions of de&s;pots, though they may not have the diadems, di&s;plays many of the &s;ymptoms of downright lunacy. Pride is allowed by the phy&s;icians to have a powerful effect in turning the brain; and though it may not always fit the unhappy &s;ufferer for Bedlam, yet commonly renders him unfit for the offices of &s;ocial life.</P>
<P>Shocking as madne&s;s is, it &s;ometimes behaves in a manner which turns pity into laughter. Can any thing be more ridiculous, than the in|&s;olence of &s;ome per&s;ons, who, having adopted high ari&s;tocratical notions, to corre&s;pond with their high birth, high titles, and high rank, declare that they know not what is meant by the people out of parliament; that they do not acknowledge the political exi&s;tence of the peo|ple, but on the benches of St. Stephen's cha|pel? Individuals of low degree they may know, and employ in their &s;ervice, but they know nothing of the people, as <HI>millions</HI> of MEN, po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ing rights or power. "The con&s;titution (&s;ay they) knows nothing of the people con&s;i|dered as individuals." King, lords, and com|mons con&s;titute the nation; but what is meant by the people they cannot divine. A mob they know, and would always have them di&s;|per&s;ed by the military, as &s;oon as two or three
<PB N="218" REF="028936_0226_0FDD7664EB292220">are gathered together; but the people, as a part of the con&s;titution, they never could di&s;|cover.</P>
<P>Mr. Burke, the great Goryphaeus of ari&s;to|cracy, &s;ays, "As a <HI>people</HI> can have no right to a corporate capacity without <HI>univer&s;al con&s;ent,</HI> &s;o neither have they a right to hold exclu&s;ively any lands in the name and title of a corporation. On the &s;cheme of the pre&s;ent rulers in our neighboring country, regenerated as they are, they <HI>have no more right to the territory called France</HI> than I (Edmund Burke) have. <HI>Who are the&s;e in&s;olent men, calling them&s;elves the French nation,</HI> that would monopolize this fair domain of nature? Is it becau&s;e they &s;peak a certain jargon? Is it their mode of chattering? The crowd of men on the other &s;ide of the Channel, <HI>who have the impudence to call them|&s;elves a</HI> PEOPLE, can never be the lawful exclu&s;ive po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of the &s;oil." How truly laughable to hear an individual, Mr. Edmund Burke, taxing twenty-&s;ix millions of human creatures with IMPUDENCE, for pre&s;uming to call them&s;elves a PEOPLE! I mu&s;t &s;mile at &s;uch ab&s;urdity, while I &s;incerely lament that this ingenious man has mi&s;&s;ed the opportunity of rai&s;ing his family to the peerage, the grand object of &s;o many years indefatigable labor, by a lo&s;s never to be repaired, and in which every feeling heart mu&s;t &s;ympathize. Ambition, what art thou to the feelings of a father, ex|claiming, like David, "O Ab&s;alom, my &s;on, my &s;on!" The great teacher Death &s;hews the

<P>The &s;ubtle writer goes on and ob&s;erves, that "When the multitude (from the context he means a MAJORITY <HI>of the people</HI>) are not under the habitual &s;ocial di&s;cipline of the wi&s;er, mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> expert, and more <HI>opulent,</HI> they can &s;carcely be &s;aid to BE in civil &s;ociety ....

The mind owes to them no &s;ort of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. They are, as they have always been reputed, rebels. They may <HI>lawfully be</HI> FOUGHT WITH and <HI>brought under,</HI> whenever an advantage offers."</P>
<P>What gave ri&s;e to the&s;e elucidations he has told us a few pages before. "The factions now &s;o bu&s;y among&s;t us, in order to dive&s;t men of all love of their country and to remove from their minds all duty with regard to the &s;tate, endeavor to propagate an opinion that the PEOPLE, in forming their <HI>commonwealth,
<PB N="220" REF="028936_0228_0FDD7667DCB95908">have by no means parted with their power over it!" Horrendum dictu!</HI></P>
<P>"Di&s;cu&s;s any of their &s;chemes&mdash;their an&s;wer is&mdash;it is the act of the PEOPLE, and that is &s;uf|ficient!&mdash;The people are ma&s;ters of the com|monwealth; becau&s;e in &s;ub&s;tance they are the commonwealth! The French revolution, &s;ay they, was the act of the majority of the people; and if the majority of any other people, the people of England for in&s;tance, wi&s;h to make the &s;ame change, they have the &s;ame right.&mdash; Ju&s;t the &s;ame, undoubtedly. That is, NONE AT ALL."</P>
<P>Such is the doctrine of this warm parti&s;an to ari&s;tocratical di&s;tinction. But what &s;ay &s;even or eight millions of good people, who wi&s;h nothing, in their interference in politics, but to &s;ecure and extend their own happine&s;s, and to make all others happy within the &s;pheres of their influence? Let them &s;ay what they plea&s;e, their remon&s;trance mu&s;t not be heard. They are political <HI>non-entities;</HI> they are, as pride commonly calls inferiors in private life, NOBODY, or <HI>people whom nobody knows.</HI></P>
<P>But now comes the tax-gatherer. The&s;e non-entities mu&s;t find <HI>real</HI> tangible money to pay for the &s;alaries of places, to pay pen&s;ions, and the intere&s;t of money advanced for the waging of wars, &s;aid to be in defence of law, order, and religion. It will not do to plead that they have no political exi&s;tence. A very con&s;iderable part of their property, the pro|duce of their labor, mu&s;t be annually paid for
<PB N="221" REF="028936_0229_0FDD766873B15A48">the &s;upport of tho&s;e who have the effrontery to &s;ay they are not <HI>vi&s;ible,</HI> as a majority of indi|viduals, in the eye of the con&s;titution.</P>
<P>At a general election, would any candidate for a con&s;iderable city or county dare to advance &s;uch opinions re&s;pecting the in&s;ignificance, or rather non-exi&s;tence, of the people, as have been advanced by borough members, in their zeal for power and prerogative? The <HI>People</HI> would deny the doctrine with a voice loud enough to &s;ilence the mo&s;t ob&s;treperous de|claimer.</P>
<P>Mr. Burke will make no new converts to this opinion. The Tory party had adopted it, previou&s;ly to the in&s;truction of their &s;anguine advocate. It was always one of their principles. The people them&s;elves will certainly reprobate ideas which lead to their political <HI>annihilation,</HI> in <HI>every</HI> re&s;pect, but in the privilege of contri|buting to the public revenue. But one cannot be &s;urpri&s;ed at any wild a&s;&s;ertions of a man who writes under the impul&s;e of pa&s;&s;ion. Anger, inflamed by mortified pride, &s;eems to animate almo&s;t every &s;entence of his late invective. And what are we to think of the WHIGISM of one, who, in the commencement of the alarm concerning French principles, is &s;aid to have propo&s;ed to Mr. Fox to join together (the&s;e are the very words of the propo&s;al) in "FROWN|ING DOWN THE DOCTRINES OF LIBERTY
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Mr. Wyvill's Letter to Mr. Pitt, page 108.</NOTE>." The propo&s;er mu&s;t have no &s;mall opinion of
<PB N="222" REF="028936_0230_0FDD766BF7B58D08">him&s;elf, when he imagined that, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by <HI>one</HI> more, he could <HI>frown down the doctrines of liberty.</HI> Jupiter &s;hook Olympus with a nod; and Burke was to di&s;countenance liberty, and annihilate the political exi&s;tence of a people, with a FROWN.</P>
<Q>Divi&s;um imperium cum Jove, Burkus habet.</Q>
<P>I revere the private virtues of the man. I feel and admire his excellence as a writer. I de|plore the mi&s;take which has led him to gratify the <HI>few</HI> in power, at the expence of millions of his fellow-creatures, who would have re|joiced in &s;uch an advocate again&s;t the influence of the de&s;potic &s;pirit.

Genius &s;hould ever e&s;pou&s;e the cau&s;e of liberty, and of tho&s;e who have no &s;tanding armies, no trea&s;ury, no tribe of dependents, nothing to &s;tand their friend, but a good cau&s;e, which, in a corrupt &s;tate of &s;ociety, is too often defeated by a bad one.</P>
<P>May the people, in all climates which the &s;un views in his daily progre&s;s, prove their po|litical exi&s;tence by their public virtue!

In our own country, we have a king who rules in the hearts of his people, and who would therefore be the fir&s;t to reject the doctrines of Mr. Burke, which tend to &s;ink the people, as a majority of individuals, into a &s;tate of in&s;igni|ficance. May the people claim and pre&s;erve
<PB N="223" REF="028936_0231_0FDD766D41486E20">their rights, in defiance of all overruling influ|ence, and all &s;ophi&s;tical declamation.

<P>IT is an infallible proof of great abi|lities in a writer who e&s;pou&s;es the cau&s;e of the people, when he is cavilled at, written again&s;t, and condemned by the per&s;ons who&s;e de&s;potic principles he has endeavored to expo&s;e and refute. It is a &s;ign that he has touched them to the quick, and left a fore place, the &s;mart of which is continually urging them to mur|mur. Their affected deri&s;ion and contempt of him are but tran&s;parent veils to hide the wri|things of their tortured minds; an awkward ma&s;que to cover the ugly features of impotent revenge, &s;truggling, through pride, to conceal the painful emotions of rage.</P>
<P>It is amu&s;ing to ob&s;erve what mean and little arts are u&s;ed by the&s;e angry per&s;ons, to lower the character of any writer, who&s;e arguments they cannot refute. They hire a venal tool to write his life and crowd it with every fal&s;ehood and calumny which party malice can invent, and popular credulity di&s;&s;eminate. They re|late, without examination into a &s;ingle fact, and decide, without the &s;malle&s;t attention to candor or ju&s;tice. The man is to be hunted
<PB N="225" REF="028936_0233_0FDD7674C4AC3290">down. The mini&s;ter and his creatures cry havoc, and let &s;lip the vermin of corruption. The new&s;papers, in daily paragraphs, di&s;charge the venom of abu&s;e on his name. <HI>Venal cri|tiques</HI> pour their acrimonious cen&s;ure, in general terms, on his compo&s;itions, which they could not equal, and dare not examine with impar|tiality. Nicknames are fa&s;tened on him; and whenever he is &s;poken of, all additions of re|&s;pect are omitted, and, in their place, &s;ome familiar and vulgar abbreviation of his chri&s;tian name is u&s;ed to vilify his &s;urname. Poor arti|fices indeed! for while they expo&s;e the malice and weakne&s;s of tho&s;e who u&s;e them, they leave the arguments and doctrines of the writer rather confirmed than &s;haken by an attack &s;o feeble.</P>
<P>It is not &s;urpri&s;ing, indeed, that <HI>cotempo|rary</HI> writers in favor of the people, whatever their abilities, and however convincing their arguments, are treated with affected contempt, as often as they excite real admiration. Envy always &s;trikes at <HI>living</HI> merit. The policy of the a&s;pirants at arbitrary power unites with envy, to depre&s;s all who are ri&s;ing to public e&s;teem by per&s;onal exertion, by their own virtue, in|dependently of court patronage and hereditary di&s;tinction. But it might be &s;uppo&s;ed that <HI>departed</HI> genius, elevated, by the con&s;piring voice of nations, to the highe&s;t rank, would be &s;urrounded with a &s;anctity which would defend it from profanation. It is not &s;o. The love of power, in the hearts of mean and &s;elfi&s;h
<PB N="226" REF="028936_0234_0FDD767633A78E78">men, acknowledges no reverence for genius. It has no reverential feelings beyond the pur|lieus of a court. The fal&s;e brilliancy of what is called high and fa&s;hionable life, is preferred by it to the permanent lu&s;tre of all &s;olid per|&s;onal virtue.</P>
<P>Mr. Locke, therefore, one of the chief glo|ries of Engli&s;h literature, is to be depreciated, for he wrote on the &s;ide of liberty. Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing <HI>rea&s;on</HI> in greater perfection than mo&s;t men, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e naturally inclined to e&s;pou&s;e the cau&s;e of MAN, without confining his regard to tho&s;e who boa&s;ted adventitious honors, the fanta&s;tic di&s;tinctions of birth, or the fortuitous advan|tages of fortune. The&s;e are few, compared with the millions who con&s;titute the ma&s;s of a commonwealth. His under&s;tanding, greatly elevated above the ordinary &s;tandard, clearly &s;aw, that the purpo&s;es of real philanthropy can be accompli&s;hed &s;olely by improving the condition of the MANY. <HI>They</HI> mu&s;t be taught to know and value their rights. They mu&s;t learn to reverence them&s;elves, by feeling their importance in &s;ociety. Such an improvement of their minds will lead them to act con&s;i&s;t|ently with their dignity as rational creatures, and as members of a community which they love, and the welfare of which they find to depend on their own virtue.</P>
<P>Mr. Locke was certainly &s;timulated to write his book on government by the&s;e philo&s;ophical and philanthropic ideas. In pur&s;uance of tho&s;e ideas, he wi&s;hed to &s;upport, by doctrines favor|able
<PB N="227" REF="028936_0235_0FDD7677D7838418">to general liberty, the REVOLUTION. Let us attend to his own words in his Preface.</P>
<P>"The&s;e papers, (&s;ays he), I hope, are &s;uf|ficient to e&s;tabli&s;h the throne of our great Re&s;torer, our pre&s;ent King William; to make good his title, in the CONSENT OF THE PEO|PLE, which, BEING THE ONLY ONE OF ALL LAWFUL GOVERNMENTS, he has more fully and clearly than any prince in Chri&s;tendom; and to ju&s;tify to the world the people of En|gland, who&s;e love of their ju&s;t and natural rights, with their re&s;olution to pre&s;erve them, &s;aved the nation when it was on the very brink of &s;lavery and ruin."</P>
<P>Mr. Locke's book then tends directly to &s;trengthen the foundation of the throne on which the pre&s;ent royal family is &s;eated. It is equally favorable to the king and the people. Yet becau&s;e it is <HI>at all</HI> favorable to the people and the general cau&s;e of liberty, it is the fa&s;hion, in the ari&s;tocratical circles, to revile it. It is &s;aid to contain the elements of tho&s;e doc|trines which the philo&s;ophers of France have dilated, which gave independence to America, and rendered France a republic. It is &s;aid, very unju&s;tly, to contain the &s;eminal principles of Mr. Paine's matured and expanded tree. Mr. Locke, therefore, the great defender of the Revolution and of King William, is repro|bated by Tory courtiers, and numbered, by the a&s;pirants at enormous power and privileges, to which they have no ju&s;t and natural claim,
<PB N="228" REF="028936_0236_0FDD767BD900AE38">among Lord Auckland's <HI>"mi&s;creants called philo&s;ophers."</HI></P>
<P>Men who undertake to defend any thing contrary to the common &s;en&s;e and common intere&s;t of mankind, u&s;ually hurt the &s;ide they intend to defend, by promoting a <HI>di&s;cu&s;&s;ion,</HI> and calling forth common &s;en&s;e, excited by the common intere&s;t, to defend its own cau&s;e. Thus Sir Robert Filmer's book gave ri&s;e both to Sydney's and Locke's defence of liberty. Thus Mr. Burke's Reflections on France drew forth Mr. Paine's Rights of Man, in which is much excellent matter, mingled with a blame|able cen&s;ure of limited monarchy. Thus Sal|ma&s;ius's mercenary invective again&s;t the repub|licans of England in the la&s;t century, provoked the great Milton, &s;carcely le&s;s eloquent in pro&s;e than in poetry, to defend the right of the people of England to manage, in their own country their own concerns, according to their own judgment and inclination.</P>
<P>Milton and Locke are great names on the &s;ide of liberty. But Milton has been treated coutemptuou&s;ly; and &s;ome have &s;hewn a &s;pirit illiberal enough to detract from his poetry in revenge for his politics. His la&s;t biographer, Dr. John&s;on, who had many early prejudices which his mo&s;t vigorous rea&s;on could not to the la&s;t &s;ubdue, was, by early prejudice, a violent Tory and Jacobite. I think there is rea&s;on to believe, that he would have been ea&s;ily made a convert to popery. I venerate
<PB N="229" REF="028936_0237_0FDD767CEBA92F60">his abilities and virtues; but I cannot help remarking, that his high-church and high-pre|rogative principles led him to &s;peak le&s;s honor|ably of Milton than he mu&s;t have done if he had viewed him through a medium undi&s;co|lored. Milton was a greater man than John|&s;on; and though I think he went too far in his hatred to monarchy and epi&s;copacy, yet, in extenuation, let it be con&s;idered how much monarchy and epi&s;copacy had been abu&s;ed in his time, and how much more friendly to free|dom they both are in our happier age. Milton di&s;covered a noble &s;pirit of independence, and his writings contain &s;ome of the fine&s;t pa&s;&s;ages that ever were written in vindication of civil liberty. They contributed to rai&s;e that &s;pirit which afterwards produced our happy revolu|tion; and I have no doubt but that Milton would have rejoiced under a <HI>limited</HI> monarchy. It is to writings and to a &s;pirit like his mankind are indebted for the limitation. If hone&s;t and able minds like Milton's had not appeared on the part of the people, it is probable that no &s;uch thing as a limited monarch would have been found on the face of the earth; and the family now on the Briti&s;h throne, would have been known only in the petty dyna&s;ties of the German empire.</P>
<P>Free &s;pirits are therefore to be pardoned in &s;ome errors, which the propen&s;ity of human nature to err mu&s;t ever render <HI>venial;</HI> and the general tendency of their writings to make the
<PB N="230" REF="028936_0238_0FDD767E6DB5E780">ma&s;s of mankind free and happy, ought to &s;ecure attention to their doctrines, and honor to their names. The enemies to the &s;pirit of de&s;poti&s;m have &s;een, with pain, the attempts to le&s;&s;en the&s;e great men in the eyes of the world extended to writers of le&s;s renown, but of more recent date. They have &s;een men, <HI>good men in private life,</HI> and philo&s;ophers, who&s;e di&s;cour&s;es and letters have gained the notice and e&s;teem of every enlightened country, re|proached, vilified, per&s;ecuted, and almo&s;t de|&s;troyed, becau&s;e, in con&s;equence of that fine under&s;tanding which had done &s;o much in phi|lo&s;ophy, they made &s;ome di&s;coveries in polities which mu&s;t for ever militate powerfully again&s;t the &s;pirit of de&s;poti&s;m. Voltaire, Rou&s;&s;eau, Raynal, Price, Prie&s;tley, Paine, however dif|ferent their characters, attainments, and abili|ties, are all vilified <HI>together,</HI> (becau&s;e they have written admirably on the &s;ide of liberty), all involved in one indi&s;criminate torrent of oblo|quy. The parti&s;ans of unlimited power would per&s;uade us, not only that they were knaves, but fools.

<HEAD>SECTION XXIX. <HI>Of the De&s;poti&s;m of</HI> INFLUFNCE; <HI>while the Forms of a free Con&s;titution are pre&s;erved.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE words of a great lawyer, in|&s;tructing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he youth of a nation at a celebrated univer&s;ity, mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed to be well con&s;i|dered. Black&s;tone, the grave commentator, after expatiating on the advantages derived from the Revolution, proceeds to remark, that "though the&s;e provi&s;ions have <HI>nominally</HI> and in <HI>appearance,</HI> reduced the &s;trength of the execu|tive power to a much lower ebb than in the preceding period; yet if, on the other hand, we throw into the oppo&s;ite &s;cale the va&s;t acqui|&s;ition of force ari&s;ing from the RIOT ACT, and the annual expedience of a STANDING ARMY; and the va&s;t acqui&s;ition of PERSONAL ATTACH|MENT, ari&s;ing from the magnitude of the <HI>national debt,</HI> and the manner of levying tho&s;e yearly millions that are appropriated to pay the intere&s;t; we &s;hall find that the CROWN has gradually and imperceptibly gained almo&s;t as much INFLUENCE as it has apparently lo&s;t in prerogative."</P>
<P>Black&s;tone, con&s;i&s;tently with the habits of his profe&s;&s;ion, expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf cautiou&s;ly. He &s;ays the Crown has gained <HI>almo&s;t</HI> as much influence as it has apparently lo&s;t in preroga|tive. There are men of great pol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tical judg|ment
<PB N="233" REF="028936_0241_0FDD768A89C10A30">who think that it has gained more. The Hou&s;e of Commons has, in an au&s;picious hour, re&s;olved, and it can never be too often repeated, that the influence of the crown has increa&s;ed, is increa&s;ing, and ought to be dimi|ni&s;hed. Influence is more dangerous than pre|togative. It is a &s;ubtle poi&s;on that acts un&s;een. Prerogative can be re&s;i&s;ted, as a robber; but influence is as an a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in.</P>
<P>Lord Bolingbroke tells us, that "we have lo&s;t the &s;pirit of our con&s;titution; and therefore we bear, from little engro&s;&s;ers of delegated power, what our fathers would not have &s;uf|fered from true proprietors of the royal autho|rity."</P>
<P>Such &s;ugge&s;tions are certainly alarming. They come from high authority, and are abun|dantly confirmed by recent tran&s;actions. The magnitude of the national debt, and the &s;hare that almo&s;t every family in the kingdom, di|rectly or indirectly, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es in the public funds, contribute, more than all other cau&s;es, to in|crea&s;e the influence of the Crown among the ma&s;s of the people. But the debt is &s;till in|crea&s;ing, in con&s;equence of war. Property in the funds is &s;till more widely diffu&s;ed; the in|fluence, in con&s;equence, more extended. Li|berty may be more effectually invaded by the influence of the <HI>&s;tocks,</HI> than it ever was invaded, in the days of the Stuarts, by the abu&s;e of prerogative.</P>
<P>We are happy in a king, who, making the happine&s;s of the people his fir&s;t object, cer|tainly
<PB N="234" REF="028936_0242_0FDD768F1BB3B490">would not avail him&s;elf of any advantages afforded by circum&s;tances, to intrench upon their liberty. But be it remembered, that <HI>mini&s;ters</HI> in this country, with their favorites, often con&s;titute an OLIGARCHY.</P>
<P>This mini&s;terial OLIGARCHY may certainly abu&s;e the influence of the Crown, &s;o as to ren|der it&s;elf virtually &s;uperior to the limited and con&s;titutional monarchy. Should &s;uch ever be the ca&s;e, the <HI>oligarchy</HI> will be a &s;pecies of de&s;|poti&s;m, the more formidable as the more in&s;idi|ous, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the power, but denying the form. By a judicious di&s;tribution of favors, by alluring all the ric<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and great to its &s;ide, either by hope or by fear, it may erect a ram|part, which the independent part of the people, acting from no &s;y&s;tem, and di&s;united, may vainly &s;eek to demoli&s;h. The monarch and the people may join hand in hand, without effect, again&s;t a <HI>mini&s;terial oligarchy,</HI> thus buttre&s;&s;ed by a faction compo&s;ed of rank and wealth, art|fully combined, in the meane&s;t manner, for the ba&s;e&s;t purpo&s;es. Fal&s;e alarms may be &s;pread on the danger of <HI>property</HI> from the dif|fu&s;ion of new principles, &s;o as to drive all who po&s;&s;e&s;s an acre of land, or a hundred pounds in the public funds, within the mini&s;terial pale. <HI>Religion</HI> may be &s;aid to be in danger, in order to bring in the devout and well di&s;po&s;ed. <HI>Order</HI> may be declared in jeopardy, that the weak, the timid, and the quiet may be led, by their fears, to unite with wealth and power. Plots and con&s;piracies are common expedients of
<PB N="235" REF="028936_0243_0FDD769088A6AD08">delu&s;ion. They have been u&s;ed, by profligate mini&s;ters, with &s;uch a total di&s;regard to truth and probability, that they now begin to lo&s;e their effect. But how dreadful, if influence &s;hould ever prevail with JURIES, to gratify the inventors of fal&s;e plots, trea&s;ons, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d con&s;pi|racies, by bringing in verdicts favorable to the views of the villainous fabricators! Engli&s;h juries are indeed &s;till uncorrupted. They are unconnected with courts and mini&s;ters. And the uncorrupt part of our &s;y&s;tem, in ca&s;es of &s;tate trials, is able to prevent the mi&s;chief which would be cau&s;ed by the corrupt part of it. The hone&s;t juries, in the late trials for trea&s;on, have not only done honor to our country and to human nature, but added great &s;trength to the cau&s;e of truth, ju&s;tice, and the con&s;titu|tion.</P>
<P>But it is truly alarming, to hear the verdicts of juries obliqely impeached by GREAT MEN in the <HI>legi&s;lative a&s;&s;emblies.</HI> There has appeared no &s;tronger &s;ymptom of the &s;pirit of de&s;poti&s;m, than the attempts of courtiers and crown law|yers, in the public &s;enate, to vilify juries and their verdicts, given after a more &s;olemn and longer inve&s;tigation than ever took place on &s;imilar trials. Per&s;ons acquitted after &s;uch an ordeal, have been &s;aid to be no more innocent than <HI>acquitted felons.</HI> That the people have borne &s;uch an in&s;ult on their mo&s;t valuable privilege, with patience, is a proof that a tame acquie&s;cence has been produced among them, unknown to their virtuous ance&s;tors. It is to
<PB N="236" REF="028936_0244_0FDD76924560B198">be hoped the in&s;ult will &s;timulate future juries to pre&s;erve their rights with jealous vigilance, and render them impregnable by mini&s;terial influence, directly or indirectly applied. If the men who di&s;approve the verdicts of the virtu|ous juries, on the late occa&s;ions, had them|&s;elves been the jurors, they would have given different verdicts, pronounced the pri&s;oners guilty, and a&s;&s;igned them over to the re&s;ent|ment of irritated, ari&s;tocratic pride. So mighty is the de&s;poti&s;m of influence, that neither ju&s;|tice nor mercy can check it in the brea&s;t of a proud para&s;ite.</P>
<P>There is every rea&s;on to believe, (and the belief is highly con&s;olatory), that juries will long continue to pre&s;erve their integrity; becau&s;e they are indi&s;criminately &s;elected from the <HI>middle</HI> rank and the ma&s;s of the <HI>people.</HI> Influence cannot reach every individual in the millions that con&s;titute a great nation. But we mu&s;t remember that influence is <HI>increa&s;ing;</HI> and that its nature is to diffu&s;e deadly poi&s;on, without giving alarm. Like the air loaded with infection, it &s;ilently and &s;ecretly wafts di&s;ea&s;e into the &s;tronge&s;t abodes of health, and penetrates the ca&s;tle, which is impregnable to the &s;word of the open invader. Therefore, as influence increa&s;es, the jealou&s;y and vigilance of the uninfected part of the community &s;hould increa&s;e in proportion. Though undue influ|ence may never operate on juries, yet is there no danger le&s;t it &s;hould, at &s;ome di&s;tant period, contaminate the minds of judges and
<PB N="237" REF="028936_0245_0FDD7693939058B8"><HI>crown lawyers,</HI> for who&s;e ob&s;equious interpre|tations of law may be held up prizes mo&s;t glit|tering in the eyes of imagination, and mo&s;t alluring to avarice and vanity?</P>
<P>But granting that the foul &s;tain of corruption &s;hould never &s;pot the white robe of <HI>ju&s;tice;</HI> that the religion of an oath &s;hould &s;till be revered, and con&s;cience hold the balance with an even hand; yet is there no danger le&s;t the <HI>de&s;poti&s;m of influence</HI> &s;hould de&s;troy the vitals of a <HI>free con&s;titution,</HI> and leave nothing behind but the form, the <HI>exuviae,</HI> the name? There was a <HI>&s;enate</HI> under the vile&s;t of the Roman em|perors. The Briti&s;h hou&s;e of commons might become, under a <HI>mini&s;terial oligarchy,</HI> the mere levee of a prime mini&s;ter. They might meet merely to <HI>"bow and bow,"</HI> receive their orders and <HI>douceurs,</HI> and then depart in peace.</P>
<P>The <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> &s;tate of the hou&s;e of commons cannot be too generally known; and I there|fore tran&s;cibe the following pa&s;&s;age from the Proceedings of the Society of the Friends of the People.</P>
<P>"The condition of the Hou&s;e of Commons is <HI>practically</HI> as follows:</P>
<P>"Seventy-one <HI>peers</HI> and the <HI>Trea&s;ury</HI> NO<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">I|NATE ninety members, and procure the return of <HI>&s;eventy-&s;even,</HI> which amount to one hundred and &s;ixty-&s;even.

<P><PB N="238" REF="028936_0246_0FDD76946703E270">
So that the peers, the <HI>Trea&s;ury,</HI> and <HI>rich</HI> commoners with influence equal to peers, re|turn three hundred and &s;ix members out of five hundred and thirteen, which is the whole number of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> repre&s;entatives in the Hou&s;e of Commons. The <HI>Scotch</HI> members are not con&s;idered in this part of the Report.</P>
<P>The Society give the names of the different patrons at full length, to authenticate their &s;tatement; and I believe its accuracy and au|thenticity have never been controverted.</P>
<P>After ob&s;erving that <HI>&s;eventy-one</HI> PEERS and the <HI>Trea&s;ury</HI> nominate or procure the return of one hundred and &s;ixty-&s;even members of parliament, who may vote away the <HI>people</HI>'s money, and make laws, with the other branches, to bind many millions, let us remember, that at the commencement of every &s;e&s;&s;ion, the fol|lowing re&s;olutions are entered on the Journals:</P>
<P>"Re&s;olved, that no peer of this realm hath any right to give his vote in the election of any member to &s;erve in parliament. Re&s;olved, that it is a high infringement upon the liberties and privileges of the Commons of Great-Bri|tain, for any lord of parliament, or any lord-lieutenant of any county, to concern them&s;elves in the elections of members to &s;erve for the Commons in Parliament."</P>
<P>The committee of the Friends of the People &s;ay, "they have been the more di&s;po&s;ed to take notice of tho&s;e re&s;olutions, becau&s;e the power of the Hou&s;e of Lords, in matters of
<PB N="239" REF="028936_0247_0FDD7698E92D1B70">election, has been prodigiou&s;ly increa&s;ed, with|in the <HI>la&s;t ten years,</HI> by the creation of <HI>nine peers,</HI> who return, by nomination and influ|ence, no le&s;s than TWENTY-FOUR members to the Hou&s;e of Commons. If, therefore, the interference of the Lords in the election of the Commons be, as the latter uniformly declare, a <HI>high infringement</HI> of their liberties and privi|leges, the Committee mu&s;t report tho&s;e liber|ties to have been of late &s;ubject to the mo&s;t alarming and frequent attacks."</P>
<P>After producing facts that defy denial, I confidently leave every hone&s;t and &s;en&s;ible man in the kingdom, unblinded by prejudice, un|warped by intere&s;t, to determine whether the cau&s;e of liberty is not on the decline, and the &s;pirit of de&s;poti&s;m likely to avail it&s;elf of the general corruption of the ari&s;tocracy, and the tame acquie&s;cence of the people.</P>
<P>I leave the que&s;tion to be determined by &s;uch men, whether it is not po&s;&s;ible that INFLU|ENCE may create a complete <HI>de&s;poti&s;m</HI> in a country, even while the <HI>forms</HI> of a free con|&s;titution are pre&s;erved inviolate?</P>

<HEAD>SECTION XXX. <HI>The Spirit of De&s;poti&s;m delights in War or &s;y&s;tematic Murder.</HI></HEAD>
<P>"THE <HI>people</HI> of England are in|du&s;trious, they are peaceful, they wi&s;h to enjoy the fruits of their indu&s;try without a <HI>war,</HI> and to recover their lo&s;t weight in our mixed frame of government, without the hazards of a <HI>revo|lution.</HI></P>
<P>"It is from the prevalence of <HI>Mr. Burke</HI>'s <HI>politics</HI> alone, among the <HI>upper cla&s;&s;es</HI> of &s;ociety, that the ri&s;e of any <HI>dangerous di&s;affection</HI> in this country is to be apprehended. To the plain &s;en&s;e of Engli&s;hmen, a war commenced with France, on <HI>his</HI> principles, mu&s;t appear to be a war on French liberty, to beat down the equi|table claims of reformation <HI>here,</HI> and <HI>eventually to de&s;troy every valuable right of the people.</HI></P>
<P>"Such will be the &s;u&s;pected motives for plunging this country in a war, in which our <HI>fleets</HI> may be victorious, but in which even our &s;ucce&s;&s;es mu&s;t be ruinous. For views thus wild and chimerical, the nation, who&s;e wounds received in the late war with America are hardly yet clo&s;ed up, mu&s;t prepare to bleed afre&s;h. For objects thus odious and de&s;table, <HI>the indu&s;trious cla&s;&s;es of the people mu&s;t forego their comforts;</HI> the &s;houlders, already galled with taxes, the pernicious con&s;equence of <HI>for|mer</HI>
<PB N="241" REF="028936_0249_0FDD769C6E9F7878">INJUSTICE and FOLLY, mu&s;t &s;ubmit again to new and heavier impo&s;itions.</P>
<P>"They will be cheerfully voted, no doubt, by the <HI>faithful Commons;</HI> but the Commons will no longer enjoy the confidence of the public. Every vote of credit or &s;upply will then increa&s;e the general di&s;gu&s;t; and &s;hould no greater di&s;a&s;ter befal us, the mere pro|traction of the war mu&s;t exhau&s;t the patience of a di&s;abu&s;ed people.</P>
<P>"But what may be the contagious effect of French opinions on a nation <HI>&s;ick of the war of kings,</HI> groaning under an intolerable load of taxes, and hopele&s;s of redre&s;s from men, <HI>whom they will cea&s;e to con&s;ider as repre&s;entatives,</HI> it is needle&s;s to &s;tate. To fore&s;ee it, is ea&s;y; to prevent it, may be impo&s;&s;ible."</P>
<P>Thus far the excellent WYVILL, in a letter to Mr. Pitt, in which he wi&s;ely di&s;&s;uaded him from the unfortunate and di&s;graceful war, of which that mini&s;ter mu&s;t &s;oon repent, though power and repentance do not u&s;ually unite. No di&s;&s;uation could cool Mr. Pitt's heroic ardor, or check his juvenile impetuo&s;ity. War was ha&s;tily commenced. The con&s;equences were foretold, and the prediction is fulfilled.</P>
<P>But to an accurate ob&s;erver it is an alarming proof of the &s;pirit of de&s;poti&s;m, when the GREAT are eager to ru&s;h into <HI>war;</HI> when they li&s;ten to no terms of accommodation, and &s;corn to negociate, in any mode or degree, previou&s;ly to un&s;heathing the dreadful in&s;trument of &s;laughter. If war, in&s;tead of being what it
<PB N="242" REF="028936_0250_0FDD769E6301EA00">has been called, the <HI>ratio ultima,</HI> becomes the <HI>ratio prima regum,</HI> it is a proof that <HI>rea&s;on</HI> has lo&s;t her empire, and force u&s;urped her throne.</P>
<P>FEAR is the principle of all de&s;potic govern|ment, and therefore de&s;pots make war their fir&s;t &s;tudy and delight. No arts and &s;ciences, no|thing that contributes to the comfort or the embelli&s;hment of human &s;ociety, is half &s;o much attended to, in countries where the &s;pirit of de&s;poti&s;m is e&s;tabli&s;hed, as the means of de&s;troying human life. Tigers, wolves, earth|quakes, inundations, are all innocuous to man, when compared with the fierce&s;t of mon&s;ters, the GORY DESPOTS. Fiends, furies, demons of de&s;truction! may the day be near, when, as wolves have been utterly extirminated from England, de&s;pots may be cut off from the face of the whole earth; and the bloody memory of them loaded with the execration of every human being, to whom God has given a heart to feel, and a tongue to utter!</P>
<P>Wherever a particle of their accur&s;ed <HI>&s;pirit</HI> is found, there al&s;o will be found a propen&s;ity to war. In times of peace, the <HI>grandees</HI> find them|&s;elves &s;hrunk to the &s;ize of common mortals. A finer hou&s;e, a finer coach, a finer coat, a finer livery than others can afford, is all that they can di&s;play to the eye of the multitude, in proof of their a&s;&s;umed &s;uperiority. Their POWER is incon&s;iderable. But no &s;ooner do you blow the bla&s;t of war, and put armies under their command, than they feel them&s;elves indeed great and powerful. A hundred thou&s;and
<PB N="243" REF="028936_0251_0FDD76A3F51FFDA8">men, in battle array, with all the in&s;truments of de&s;truction, under the command of a few <HI>grandees,</HI> inferior, perhaps, in bodily &s;trength, to every one of the &s;ubject train, and but little &s;uperior in intellect or courage, yet, holding ALL, on pain of death, in ab&s;olute &s;ubjection; how mu&s;t it elevate the <HI>little de&s;pots</HI> in their own opinion! "This it is to live," (they ex|claim, &s;haking hands with each other), "this is to be great indeed. <HI>Now</HI> we feel our power. Glory be to us on high; e&s;pecially as all our fame and greatne&s;s is perfectly compatible with our per&s;onal &s;afety; for we will not ri&s;que our precious per&s;ons in the &s;cene of danger, but be content with our <HI>extended patronage,</HI> with the delight of commanding the movements of this human machine, and with reading of the blood, &s;laughter, and burnt villages, in the Gazette, at our fire-&s;ide."</P>
<P>All the expence of war is paid by the peo|ple, and mo&s;t of the per&s;onal danger incurred by tho&s;e, who, according to &s;ome, have no political exi&s;tence; I mean the <HI>multitude, told by the head,</HI> like &s;heep in Smithfield. Many of the&s;e trouble&s;ome beings, in human form, are happily got rid of in the field of battle, and more by &s;ickne&s;s and hard&s;hip previous or &s;ub&s;equent to the glorious day of butchery. Thus all makes for the &s;pirit of de&s;poti&s;m. There are, in con&s;equence of a great carnage, fewer <HI>wretches</HI> left to provide for, or to oppo&s;e its will; and all the honor, all the profit, all the <HI>amu&s;ement,</HI> falls to the &s;hare of the <HI>grandees,</HI>
<PB N="244" REF="028936_0252_0FDD76A62AA27590">thus rai&s;ed from the in&s;ignificance and inglo|rious indolence of peace, to have their names blown over the world by the trumpet of Fame, and recorded in the page of hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>But a &s;tate of war not only gives a degree of per&s;onal importance to &s;ome among the great, which they could never obtain by the arts of peace, but greatly helps the cau&s;e of de&s;poti&s;m. In times of peace, the people are apt to be impertinently clamorous for reform. But in war, they mu&s;t &s;ay no more on the &s;ub|ject, becau&s;e of the public danger. It would be ill-timed. Freedom of &s;peech al&s;o mu&s;t be checked. A thou&s;and little re&s;traints on liberty are admitted without a murmur, in a time of war, that would not be borne one moment during the halcyon days of peace. Peace, in &s;hort, is productive of plenty, and plenty makes the people &s;aucy. Peace, therefore, mu&s;t not continue long, after a nation has arrived at a certain degree of pro&s;perity. This is a maxim of De&s;poti&s;m. Political phlebotomy is nece&s;&s;ary in a political plethora. "Bleed them <HI>u&s;que ad deliquium,</HI>" (&s;ays the arbitrary doctor), "and I will undertake that in &s;uture the patient &s;hall be more tractable."</P>

<P>THOSE who have been fortunate enough to have gained po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of honors and profits, under a corrupt &s;y&s;tem, well plea&s;ed with <HI>things as they are,</HI> boldly contend that they cannot be better.

<P>Rewards are offered for the di&s;covery of the longitude at &s;ea. Men are not only allowed but encouraged to pro&s;ecute their enquiries into
<PB N="250" REF="028936_0258_0FDD76B82C98DAD8">all other arts and &s;ciences. But the grand art, the art of government, that is, the art of &s;ecur|ing the civil happine&s;s of millions, is to be con|&s;idered as &s;acred and in&s;crutable. Tho&s;e very millions whom it more immediately intere&s;ts, dare not, if the de&s;pots could prevail, to lift up the awful veil. Racks, gibbets, bow&s;trings, chains, and pri&s;ons, are prepared, in mo&s;t of the kingdoms of the world, to awe the curious, and check the &s;pirit of political improvement. OPTIMISM has long been e&s;tabli&s;hed in the courts of de&s;potic princes. <HI>Whatever is, is right,</HI> &s;ay they; for knowing that they &s;tand on a rotten foundation, they fear that the very fixing of the &s;caffold for repair would precipi|tate the downfall of the whole fabric.</P>
<P>Mankind might, at the clo&s;e of this century, ju&s;tly celebrate a general jubilee; for arbitrary government, in Europe at lea&s;t, has received its death blow by the revolution in France. And it is devoutly to be wi&s;hed, for their own &s;akes, that in limited monarchies, the voice of truth and virtue, calling for the reform of abu&s;es, exi&s;ting evidently as the meridian &s;un, will never be &s;ilenced by the terrors of the law in the hands of crown lawyers, or the &s;abre of dragoons, under the command of a de&s;potic mini&s;ter.</P>
<P>Is it to be believed that governments were brought to <HI>perfection</HI> in early and dark ages, when the minds of the great as well as the little were enveloped in the mi&s;ts of ignorance, and &s;hackled by the chains of &s;uper&s;tition? Is it rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e that they who were nar|row-minded,
<PB N="251" REF="028936_0259_0FDD76B9C1FE6BF8">ill-informed, childi&s;h, and bar|barous in all other parts of knowledge and of conduct, were liberal, wi&s;e, and illuminated in the &s;cience and practice of government; &s;o liberal, &s;o wi&s;e, &s;o illuminated, as to &s;trike out at once a &s;y&s;tem <HI>complete</HI> in all its parts, and &s;uch as could in no &s;ub&s;equent age, in no variety of circum&s;tances, admit of correction, addition, or melioration? Did this wonderful fagacity, approaching to in&s;piration, produce any thing el&s;e, in any other department, which defies all improvement, and challenges the re|&s;pect and veneration of the late&s;t po&s;terity? Rea&s;oning from analogy, we mu&s;t conclude, that men, capable of e&s;tabli&s;hing at once a per|fect &s;y&s;tem of government, mu&s;t have produced <HI>other</HI> inventions for the accommodation and &s;e|curity of life, worthy to be pre&s;erved inviolate, and handed down unaltered, till time it&s;elf be ab&s;orbed in the ocean of eternity. But where &s;hall we look for it? The very que&s;tion implies a doubt of its exi&s;tence; for &s;ingular excel|lence, &s;uch excellence as approaches to per|fection, cannot be concealed, but will &s;hine with its own lu&s;tre and force, ob&s;ervation and wonder. Is the <HI>architecture</HI> of the&s;e paragons of wi&s;dom &s;uperior to the modern, in beauty or convenience? Let us only walk the &s;treets of London, and mark tho&s;e hou&s;es which were &s;pared by the great fire, and which may fairly be &s;uppo&s;ed improvements on the more antient fabrics. We &s;ee them, contrary to every prin|ciple of common &s;en&s;e, with &s;tories projecting
<PB N="252" REF="028936_0260_0FDD76BB59595970">over each other. We &s;ee them ugly, mean, inconvenient. Let us proceed to the north|we&s;t parts of that great town. Take a view of Portland-place. Contra&s;t the &s;ymmetry, the accommodation, the magnificence, with the old edifices of Holborn or Alder&s;gate, and be per|&s;uaded that modern improvements in govern|ment might be as much &s;uperior to the work of antient bunglers, as the elegant buildings of an Adams or a Wyat to the old man&s;ions now converted into inns, in the dirtie&s;t &s;treets, in the mo&s;t decayed di&s;tricts of the metropolis.</P>
<P>Man is a progre&s;&s;ive animal, and his advance towards improvement is a plea&s;urable &s;tate. Hope cheers his path as he toils up the hill that leads him to &s;omething better than he has yet experienced, on its gay &s;ummit gilded with &s;uu&s;hine. The labor of the a&s;cent is a delight. But if he cannot help conceiving, from a &s;en&s;e of grievances which he feels, &s;omething EXCEL|LENT, to which he is prohibited by coercion from approaching, hope &s;ickens, and ill-humor &s;ucceeds to complacency. Hence ari&s;es a di&s;|agreement between the governed and the go|vernors; and the governors being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of pre&s;ent power, u&s;e force and rigor to &s;tifle the murmurs of complaint. Coercion but increa&s;es the ill humor, which often lies latent, like the fires of a volcano, for a con&s;iderable time, but at la&s;t bur&s;ts forth with irre&s;i&s;tible fury. It is wi&s;e, therefore, as well as ju&s;t, in all governors, who have a regard for any thing but their pre|&s;ent and private intere&s;t, to encourage di&s;cu&s;&s;ion,
<PB N="253" REF="028936_0261_0FDD76C0B11E7E50">to &s;eek improvement of the &s;y&s;tem, and to reject no reform propo&s;ed by great numbers, without a cool, a temperate, and a long deli|beration. The rea&s;ons for rejection &s;hould be clearly &s;tated, with the utmo&s;t regard to open and ingenuous behaviour; and tho&s;e who re|main unconvinced, after all, &s;hould not be treated with a&s;perity. Every individual, in a free country, has a right to approve or di&s;ap|prove the &s;y&s;tem under which he lives, without peril or control, while be pre&s;erves the peace. His peaceable deportment and acquie&s;cence in the opinion of others, contrary to his own con|viction, renders him a very meritorious cha|racter. He may be won over by gentlene&s;s; but force only tends to excite the violence which it would imperiou&s;ly repel.</P>
<P>But to tell a man of &s;en&s;e, reading, and re|flection, that he mu&s;t not venture to entertain an opinion on political matters, or the exi&s;ting government, different from that of the mini&s;ter and the herd of courtiers, is an impotent en|deavor to exerci&s;e a de&s;poti&s;m over his mind, again&s;t which nature revolts, and a manly &s;pirit mu&s;t rebel. Such a man can u&s;ually judge of governments, and all the in&s;titutions of &s;ocial life, better than mere men of bu&s;ine&s;s, however high their rank or important their employ|ments; far better than courtiers, occupied in vain ceremonies, and u&s;ually as little able as inclined to enter into deep di&s;qui&s;ition.</P>
<P>Indeed it is difficult to avoid laughing at the extreme ignorance of crowned heads them|&s;elves,
<PB N="254" REF="028936_0262_0FDD76C1F34DE170">in de&s;potic countries, when one contra&s;ts it with the importance they a&s;&s;ume, and the pomp and &s;plendor with which they transfer their royal per&s;ons from place to place. The &s;ight is truly ludicrous. Are the&s;e the men, occupied, as they u&s;ually are, in the meane&s;t trifles and the mo&s;t degrading plea&s;ures, who tell us that the government over which they pre&s;ide, is a perfect &s;y&s;tem, and that the wife&s;t philo&s;opher knows not how to govern man|kind&mdash;that is, to con&s;ult their happine&s;s and &s;ecurity&mdash;&s;o well as them&s;elves, neglected as they have been in youth, and corrupted in manhood by panders to their vices, and flat|terers of their foibles, their pride, and their ambition? There is rea&s;on to believe that many kings, in de&s;potic kingdoms, have been le&s;s well educated, and po&s;&s;e&s;s le&s;s abilities, than a common charity-boy, trained in a pari&s;h &s;chool to read and write. Yet the&s;e are the men who, with their up&s;tart creatures, pre|&s;ume to call philo&s;ophers wretches, and to condemn the Voltaires, the Rou&s;&s;eaus, the Sydneys, the Harringtous, and the Lockes.</P>
<P>There are per&s;ons, even in countries where limited royalty is e&s;tabli&s;hed who are for ever extolling the CONSTITUTION, with all the abu&s;es that have in&s;inuated them&s;elves into it, in terms of extravagant and unqualified prai&s;e. They talk again&s;t better knowledge, and may therefore be &s;u&s;pected of &s;ome &s;ini&s;ter motive. They can &s;ee defects as well as others; but they a&s;&s;ume the wor&s;t of all blindne&s;s, that which is voluntary.</P>
<P><PB N="255" REF="028936_0263_0FDD76C380DE4E28">
The truth is, the&s;e men, for the mo&s;t part, are &s;uch as would not like the <HI>con&s;titution in its purity,</HI> becau&s;e in its purity the con&s;titution is really excellent, and highly favorable to the liberty which they hate. The con&s;titution, in its purity, renders the people of <HI>con&s;equence,</HI> who&s;e political exi&s;tence they are inclined to controvert or deny. But the con&s;titution, in its &s;tate of corruption, is favorable to preroga|tive, to ari&s;tocratical pride and influence, to Tory and jacobi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ical principles; therefore it is, in their eyes, criminal to handle it, to hint at its improvement, to remove a grievance, or reform an abu&s;e.

<P>De&s;poti&s;m is &s;o ugly in its form, and &s;o ho&s;|tile, in its nature, to human happine&s;s, that no wonder tho&s;e who wi&s;h to diffu&s;e its &s;pirit are inclined to check and di&s;courage among the people all political inve&s;tigation.

<P>IN the <HI>&s;chools</HI> of early di&s;cipline, where youth is u&s;ually initiated in the &s;tudies of humanity, men are taught to believe, that vir|tue is founded on <HI>eternal truth,</HI> and that the di&s;tinctions of right and wrong are as clearly definable as tho&s;e between the meridian &s;un&s;hine and the midnight &s;hade. They are told, from the highe&s;t authority, that happine&s;s is to be found in rectitude of conduct; and that under all circum&s;tances, whatever may be the con&s;e|quence, nothing can ju&s;tify the dereliction of integrity. The &s;acred &s;criptures, the antient philo&s;ophers, parental authority, the laws of their country, and the PROCLAMATIONS of kings, all combine to convince them, that morality is founded on the rock of truth, and that governments are <HI>&s;incere</HI> in their profe&s;&s;ions to encourage tho&s;e who do well, and be a ter|ror only to the EVIL.</P>
<P>Why was a national <HI>church</HI> in&s;tituted and &s;upported at a great expence, but to enforce among the people the laws of God, as para|mount
<PB N="257" REF="028936_0265_0FDD76CBB4C5CBD0">to all human laws, and &s;uperceding the wretched devices of &s;tate policy? Government, by entering into a &s;trict alliance with the church, certainly engages to &s;upport the doctrines of Chri&s;tian morality: and it is no le&s;s impious in a king or a mini&s;ter to promote or increa&s;e any public mea&s;ures repugnant to Chri&s;tian mora|lity, than it would be in the bench of bi&s;hops.</P>
<P>When we enter our <HI>libraries,</HI> we find our|&s;elves &s;urrounded with authors, celebrated for ages by the mo&s;t enlightened part of the world, who teach the immutability of truth, enforce the pure&s;t doctrines of morality, and endeavor to found the dignity and happine&s;s of human nature on the ba&s;is of virtue.</P>
<P>But let us leave a moment the &s;chool, the church, the library, and enter a court and a cabinet. There <HI>Machiavelian</HI> ethics prevail; and all that has been previou&s;ly inculcated appears like the tales of the nur&s;ery, calcu|lated to amu&s;e babes, and lull them in the lap of folly. The grand object of coun&s;ellors is to &s;upport and increa&s;e the POWER that appoints to &s;plendid and profitable offices, with little regard to the improvement of human affairs, the alleviation of the evils of life, and the me|lioration of human nature. The re&s;traints of moral hone&s;ty, or the &s;cruples of religon, mu&s;t &s;eldom operate on public mea&s;ures &s;o as to impede the accompli&s;hment of this primary and momentous purpo&s;e. A little <HI>varni&s;h</HI> is indeed u&s;ed, to hide the deformity of Machiaveli&s;m; but it is &s;o very thin, and &s;o ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;hed
<PB N="258" REF="028936_0266_0FDD76CD1CA1F4C0">from the native color, that it contributes, among thinking men, to increa&s;e the dete&s;tation which it was intended to extenuate.</P>
<P>Thus, for in&s;tance, treaties between nations commence with a mo&s;t &s;olemn avowal of good faith, in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Gho&s;t. Great and mighty nations, profe&s;&s;ing Chri&s;tianity, maintaining a church, united mo&s;t intimately with the church, enter into agreements, under this awful &s;anction, and break them without the lea&s;t reluctance, when|ever a <HI>cabinet</HI> mini&s;ter finds it in his inclination, or imagines it his intere&s;t to cau&s;e a rupture. The Father, the Son, and the Holy Gho&s;t are little thought of; but the great object is to &s;trike a blow with advantage, before the ad|ver&s;e nation is on its guard, and while it is relying on the treaty.</P>
<P>Another in&s;tance of <HI>political religion</HI> is con|&s;picuous in the prevailing practice of rendering the emoluments of the church &s;ub&s;ervient to the <HI>mini&s;ter,</HI> in &s;ecuring him a majority, and facili|tating what is called his principal duty, the <HI>management</HI> of the SENATE.</P>
<P>The Roman pontiffs, while in the rank of inferior clergy, and even of cardinals, have exhibited the appearance of great piety, and a religious regard to truth and ju&s;tice; but when advanced to the <HI>triple mitre,</HI> and become, in fact, KINGS, they have u&s;ually become per|fectly &s;ecular in their public conduct at home, and in their eonnections with &s;urrounding na|tions, and have pleaded, in excu&s;e, &s;tate nece&s;|&s;ity.
<PB N="259" REF="028936_0267_0FDD76D39B73A238">But can any <HI>nece&s;&s;ity</HI> ari&s;e to violate the eternal laws of truth and ju&s;tice? Is religion a leaden rule, in the <HI>hands</HI> &s;trong enough to bend it to their various purpo&s;es? Pope JULIUS the Second appears to have been one of the very wor&s;t princes that ever reigned. He delighted in WAR, while he profe&s;&s;ed to be the repre|&s;entative of the Prince of Peace. He was guilty of oppre&s;&s;ion and inju&s;tice; and while he pretended to be feeding the <HI>&s;heep</HI> of Chri&s;t, gave him&s;elf no other concern but how he might &s;ecure the fleece. Yet all his conduct was palliated, by the politicans around him, from the plea of &s;tate nece&s;&s;ity. Morality and religion gave way to the &s;y&s;tem of POLITICAL ETHICS; and he, who ought to have ble&s;&s;ed mankind, and to have preached peace, became their oppre&s;&s;or, de&s;pot, and unrelenting mur|derer. I mention JULIUS only as a &s;triking in&s;tance, and hundreds may be adduced, of the depraved &s;y&s;tem which rules cabinets, and which, for the gratification of the FEW, ren|ders the MANY mi&s;erable. No Machiavels can ever ju&s;tify, in the eyes of God, or of <HI>men</HI> un|influenced by corruption, any politics, howe|ver &s;ubtle and able, which, for the &s;ake of ag|grandizing a <HI>nation,</HI> (an <HI>ab&s;tract idea</HI>), much le&s;s of gratifying a court, renders all the indi|viduals of the <HI>nation</HI> &s;o to be aggrandized, poor, wretched, in&s;ecure, and &s;lavi&s;h.</P>
<P>Let us &s;uppo&s;e a nation entering mo&s;t eagerly, and without li&s;tening one moment to terms of accommodation, into a mo&s;t danger|ous

Will &s;he, pluming her&s;elf upon the love of order and religion, and dete&s;ting the cruelty of the nation with whom &s;he is at war, &s;uffer A&s;ia to be pillaged, and its inhabitants to be &s;laughtered by her own &s;ons; or en|courage the Indians to attack her brethren in North America; or hire mercenaries of Ger|man princes to do the work of death, in a con|te&s;t in which they have no immediate concern? Will &s;he endeavor to <HI>&s;tarve</HI> a <HI>whole</HI> nation, with whom &s;he is at war, not only the rulers and warriors, but infants, women, and old people,
<PB N="261" REF="028936_0269_0FDD76D622D10660">by preventing the importation of <HI>corn?</HI> Will &s;he FORGE a&s;&s;ignats? Will &s;he continue the &s;lave trade?</P>
<P>A conduct like this appears to be not only incon&s;i&s;tent with the pretended defence of <HI>law, order,</HI> and <HI>religion,</HI> but at once proceeding from the &s;pirit of de&s;poti&s;m, and promotive of it. It is certain that a man in private life, acting in this manner, would be thought a bad man, a man de&s;titute of principle, and with whom it would be &s;carcely le&s;s dangerous to be on terms of profe&s;&s;ed friend&s;hip than of open enmity. But actions do not alter their nature with the paucity or multiplicity of the actors; and a <HI>nation</HI> may be guilty of perfidy as atro|cious and contemptible in its nature as an indi|vidual, and infinitely more mi&s;chievous. Cer|tainly the advi&s;ers and abettors of &s;uch conduct do not take the mo&s;t effectual means of recom|mending to mankind that <HI>monarchy</HI> which they wage war to re-e&s;tabli&s;h.

<P>Whatever may be urged by &s;ophi&s;ts or poli|ticians, it is certain that the great eternal laws of truth and ju&s;tice cannot be violated with impunity. The violation may an&s;wer &s;ome fordid and temporary purpo&s;e; but in the end, it mu&s;t be injurious, if not fatal. Truth, like the &s;un in the heavens, is one. The clouds indeed are variegated; but then they are
<PB N="262" REF="028936_0270_0FDD76DDAFB4E7E8">in&s;ub&s;tantial, and of momentary exi&s;tence. So is fal&s;ehood. It can a&s;&s;ume any color. But time cau&s;es the hues to fade; and truth bur&s;ts forth with new effulgence. We &s;ee de&s;poti&s;m gradually withdrawing from the fine&s;t countries of Europe. It mu&s;t depart, at la&s;t, from all, for it is oppo&s;ed by rea&s;on and nature. They who endeavor to render it permanent, labor in vain; but at the &s;ame time, they may detain it a while, and cau&s;e, in the interval, mi&s;ery and CARNAGE.</P>
<P>Let us reject all Machiaveli&s;m, all <HI>political ethics,</HI> that contradict the acknowledged prin|ciples of truth and moral hone&s;ty. There can be no legitimate government which is not foun|ded and &s;upported by &s;y&s;tems of conduct favor|able to the happine&s;s of human creatures&mdash;the great ma&s;s of the people. Good government cannot be formed on the ba&s;is of fal&s;hood and chicanery. Let the government of England ever &s;tand on the &s;quare, &s;olid, upright pede&s;|tals of truth and ju&s;tice, and it mu&s;t defy every &s;hock, but the convul&s;ion of the world's di&s;&s;olution.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION XXXIII. <HI>On trafficking with the</HI> CURE OF SOULS (Cura Animarum,) <HI>for the Purpo&s;e of political,</HI> i. e. moral <HI>Corruption.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE pari&s;h prie&s;ts of a prote&s;tant country, when they are, what they ought to be, and what they would u&s;ually be, if it were not for political influence, CHRISTIAN ORATORS and CHRISTIAN PHILOSOPHERS, are the mo&s;t u&s;eful body of men, con&s;idering their numbers and their power, in the whole community. The good they are able to do is beyond all e&s;ti|mate; but unfortunately, it is a &s;ort of good not always taken into the account of tho&s;e who are in pur&s;uit of more palpable advantages, SOLID GOLD, high &s;tation, and DOMINION OVER THEIR FELLOW CREATURES. The proper bu&s;ine&s;s of the clergy is to mortify this very pride, the indulgence of which is to their courtly patrons, the <HI>&s;ummum bonum,</HI> the chief good of exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>The&s;e per&s;ons, not having time or inclina|tion to attend to religion, or any thing but the pomp and vanity of the world, idolizing them|&s;elves, and unwilling to acknowledge any other Deity, con&s;ider religion and the church merely as &s;tate engines; powerful engines, in con|junction with military force, to pre&s;s down the cla&s;tic &s;pirit of the people. They think, indeed,
<PB N="264" REF="028936_0272_0FDD76E3D7E8AE88">the emolume<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ts attending eccle&s;ia&s;tical functions <HI>too much,</HI> if con&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">idered as recompences for reli|gious &s;ervices, which, in their minds, are no &s;ervices at all, but <HI>&s;carcely enough,</HI> when con|verted into <HI>douceurs</HI> for the bu&s;ine&s;s of corrup|tion, the grand object of modern mini&s;ters.</P>
<P>Ambitions noblemen, therefore, buy bo|roughs, and, like Lord Melcombe, &s;end their myrmidons to the &s;enate; and mini&s;ters pay the expen&s;e of the purcha&s;e, by conferring the highe&s;t eccle&s;ia&s;tical dignities, with &s;tipends of many thou&s;ands a-year, de&s;igned originally to be &s;pent in charity, on the younger brothers, the cou&s;ins, the tutors, or the agents of the&s;e patrician borough-mongers. It is indeed deemed <HI>politic,</HI> now and then, to rai&s;e a very ingenious, learned, and pious man to the MITRE; but &s;el|dom without contriving to promote, at the &s;ame time, the grand bu&s;ine&s;s of corruption. This ingenious, learned, and pious man, <HI>un eveque de la fortune,</HI> is highly &s;atisfied with the dignity and emolument of his office. What need has he of the <HI>patronage</HI> appendant to it? In this age, it were a childi&s;h weakne&s;s, &s;ome|thing &s;imilar to the &s;implicity recommended in the go&s;gel, to give away good things to mode&s;t merit. But, though <HI>he</HI> has no need of the patronage, there are tho&s;e, to whom he is bound, by every tie of gratitude, who want it all. He therefore under&s;tands that the CURE OF SOULS is to be given to per&s;ons whom the prime mini&s;ter may recommend; as the Duke of Newca&s;tle recommended Burroughs and
<PB N="165" REF="028936_0273_0FDD76E91F7B0560">Franklin, whom he had never &s;een or known, to the patronage of the lord chancellor.

<P>Formerly learning was &s;carce among the laity. The clergy engro&s;&s;ed what little there was in the world, and made them&s;elves nece&s;|&s;ary to the &s;tate, not only in eccle&s;ia&s;tical, but political offices and employments. "Before the Reformation," (&s;ays a learned writer), "the canon law was in great u&s;e and e&s;teem, and of great u&s;e; and while the laity were in gene|ral unlettered, or employed in a military life, the king made u&s;e of clergymen, &s;killed in this law, in the offices of the chancery, privy &s;eal, &s;ecretary of &s;tate, in the courts of ju&s;tice, and in emba&s;&s;ies. The king rewarded men thus qualified to do him &s;ervice, with benefices and other eccle&s;ia&s;tical preferments; and the LORD CHANCELLOR or Lord Keeper, in particular, was furni&s;hed with many advow&s;ons, to which, as they became vacant, he might pre&s;ent wor|thy ma&s;ters and clerks in Chancery, who were <HI>then all clergymen;</HI> which advow&s;ons &s;till con|tinue in his gift, though the rea&s;on thereof
<PB N="266" REF="028936_0274_0FDD76EA761D8FB8">hath long cea&s;ed." But <HI>one</HI> rea&s;on having cea&s;ed, <HI>others</HI> may have ri&s;en &s;till more weighty. We have already remarked, more than once, how that prime mini&s;ter, the Duke of Newca&s;tle, u&s;ed the advow&s;ons in the gift of the Chancel|lor. We know how preferment is be&s;towed in Ireland as well as England. We remember the <HI>old manner</HI> of appointment to the provo&s;t|&s;hip of Trinity-college, Dublin.</P>
<P>The excellent divine from whom the la&s;t quo|tation was taken, &s;peaking of clergymen honored and enriched with <HI>two cures of &s;ouls,</HI> proceeds thus: "I do not deny but there are <HI>plurali&s;ts</HI> of great eccle&s;ia&s;tical merit; but I do deny that in general <HI>plurali&s;ts</HI> have greater merit than unali&s;ts, or than many in orders who have no living at all; or that plurali&s;ts in general, become plurali&s;ts for their eccle&s;ia&s;tical merit.</P>
<P>"Read over the li&s;t of plurali&s;ts in England, and &s;ee whether this &s;ort of merit be univer&s;ally, or generally, or COMMONLY, regarded in the <HI>di&s;pen&s;ations</HI> granted them to hold pluralities. See whether the <HI>judge</HI> of this &s;ort of merit hath power, if he were ever &s;o well inclined, to regard it univer&s;ally, or generally, or <HI>com|monly:</HI> &s;ee whether the motive of the patron to pre&s;ent a clerk to a &s;econd living, hath, in one in&s;tance out of twenty, been his eminent eccle|&s;ia&s;tical merit; or whether the &s;ame favor would not have been be&s;towed on the <HI>&s;ame</HI> per&s;on, had his merit <HI>been inferior;</HI> nay, in many ca&s;es, upon the <HI>&s;ame</HI> per&s;on, although in&s;tead of merit
<PB N="267" REF="028936_0275_0FDD76EBDB2F2310">there had been demerit; and very often al&s;o, if not the more likely, if in&s;tead of want of a competence, there had been affluence. See whether the MERIT, which hath been <HI>&s;ometimes</HI> con&s;idered in this ca&s;e, hath not, <HI>in&s;tead of eccle&s;ia&s;tical merit,</HI> been <HI>political opinions, &s;er|viceablene&s;s in elections,</HI> private treaties, dome&s;|tic negociations, and other <HI>mean offices,</HI> below the con&s;ideration and interpo&s;ition of eccle&s;ia&s;|tics, and hurtful to the eccle&s;ia&s;tical character. With &s;ome patrons, there is not one of the&s;e qualifications that is not a &s;tronger motive than parts, and learning, and piety, and prudence, and virtue put together." Thus &s;aid Dr. Newton, the founder and head of a college in Oxford, at a time when the <HI>cure of &s;ouls</HI> was not con&s;idered as &s;o trifling a care as it has been by more recent mini&s;ters, who have &s;eemed ready to &s;acrifice both &s;oul and body to the gaining of a majority in the &s;enate. The CHURCH once pre&s;erved her own dignity with a noble independence; but now &s;he mu&s;t bow, like a lacquey, to the vile&s;t mini&s;ter of &s;tate.</P>
<P>But what is this <HI>cura animarum,</HI> this office of watching over the &s;piritual &s;tate of populous di&s;tricts? Is it not, on the hypothe&s;is that the Chri&s;tian religion is true, the mo&s;t important office that can be undertaken by man on this &s;ide the grave? Is not the power of appointing to that office a tru&s;t mo&s;t &s;acred, if there be any thing &s;acred here below? What is SA|CRILEGE? the &s;tealing of a cu&s;hion or &s;ilver
<PB N="268" REF="028936_0276_0FDD76F1F9CD1E80">chalice from a church? And is it no &s;acrilege to &s;teal the church it&s;elf, and all its emolu|ments, de&s;igned to <HI>prevent</HI> the increa&s;e of cor|ruption, in order to reward and to promote corruption? Is the <HI>cura animarum</HI> to be the la&s;t con&s;ideration in the patron's mind, though the fir&s;t in the eye of rea&s;on and religion? And is all this inju&s;tice, &s;acrilege, impiety, and bla&s;|phemy to be endured, becau&s;e the gift of the &s;tipend, the endowment, the tithes, the fees, <HI>buy an elector,</HI> who <HI>&s;wears,</HI> at the time of giv|ing his vote, that he has not received a bribe? Is it to be wondered, if, under &s;uch abu&s;es, religion &s;hould be on the decline? Do the wri|tings of infidels, or the venal practices of pa|trons, contribute <HI>mo&s;t</HI> to exterminate Chri&s;ti|anity? What has a &s;imilar &s;y&s;tem in France effected, carried indeed to &s;till greater lengths, but &s;till &s;imilar? The greedy rapaciou&s;ne&s;s of court &s;ycophants in England is doing the work of ANTICHRIST, and de&s;troying civil liberty.</P>
<P>But I am chiefly concerned at pre&s;ent to con|&s;ider the u&s;ing the church, or the <HI>cure of &s;ouls,</HI> for the corruption of the <HI>&s;tate</HI> and the <HI>violation</HI> of the <HI>con&s;titution,</HI> as a POLITICAL enormity. It certainly contributes to the &s;pirit of de&s;pot|i&s;m. It naturally tends to make all the youth in the nation, who enter on this &s;acred profe&s;&s;ion, look up to court favor, and not to depend on their own merit or exertions, for promotion. It prevents them from voting freely at elections. It prevents them from preaching freely from the pulpit. Its natural tendency is to make them
<PB N="269" REF="028936_0277_0FDD76F28D27FF08">what they ought particularly to avoid, adu|lators, worldly wi&s;e, para&s;itical, and <HI>acceptors of men's per&s;ons for the &s;ake of advantage.</HI> They mu&s;t know, under &s;uch a &s;y&s;tem, that if they vote according to con&s;cience, or preach or write according to the truth as it is in Je&s;us, they mu&s;t forego all tho&s;e pro&s;pects of ri&s;ing in their profe&s;&s;ion, which, if merit were rewarded, are a &s;timulus to every thing that can benefit human nature. Clerical men, infirm, like others, often &s;ink under this temptation. Few can renounce great temporal advantages for the &s;ake of promoting public good, e&s;pecially when they are &s;ure of per&s;ecution as well as neglect. Now, what mu&s;t be the con&s;equence to liberty, of a whole national clergy rendered expectant on the favor of a court, and a proud ari&s;to|cracy? May we not hear again from the <HI>pulpit,</HI> the doctrines of divine right and pa&s;&s;ive obedi|ence; the &s;ame doctrines in effect, under names le&s;s offen&s;ive to the people? Have we not <HI>lately</HI> heard them?</P>
<P>There is no mode of promoting the purpo&s;es of corruption, and the aggrandizement of tho&s;e who already engro&s;s the pomp of grandeur, more injurious to liberty, and more villanou&s;ly ba&s;e, than that of &s;eizing the appointments and rewards of piety and virtue, to be&s;tow them on tho&s;e, who&s;e worldly wi&s;dom is their chief recommendation, and who &s;eem ready to wor&s;hip God only in the <HI>&s;econd</HI> place, if they wor&s;hip him at all.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION XXXIV. <HI>Of Mr</HI> Hume's <HI>idea, That</HI> ab&s;olute Monarchy <HI>is the ea&s;ie&s;t Death, the</HI> Euthana&s;ia <HI>of the Briti&s;h Con&s;titution.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE very ingenious &s;peculati&s;t, Mr. Hume, &s;eems to wi&s;h as well as think, that as death is unavoidable by the political as well as the animal body, the Briti&s;h con&s;titution may die in the arms of de&s;poti&s;m. His words are, "I would much rather wi&s;h to &s;ee an ab&s;olute monarch than a republic in this i&s;land. Ab&s;o|lute monarchy is the ea&s;ie&s;t death, the true <HI>euthana&s;ia</HI> of the Briti&s;h con&s;titution."</P>
<P>His opinion, that our free government will terminate in de&s;poti&s;m, &s;eems founded on the following argument, which he has in&s;erted in his E&s;&s;ay on the Briti&s;h Government.</P>
<P>"The Briti&s;h &s;pirit and love of liberty, however great, will never be able to &s;upport it&s;elf again&s;t that immen&s;e property which is now lodged in the king, and is &s;till increa&s;ing. Upon a moderate computation, there are near three millions annually at the di&s;po&s;al of the crown. The civil li&s;t amounts to near a mil|lion; the collection of all taxes to another mil|lion; and the employments in the army and navy, along with eccle&s;ia&s;tical preferments, to above a third million. A mon&s;trous &s;um! and what may fairly be computed to be more than
<PB N="272" REF="028936_0280_0FDD76F9F7EA3968">a thirtieth part of the whole income and labor of the kingdom. When we add to this immen&s;e property the increa&s;ing luxury of the nation, our pronene&s;s to corruption, along with the great power and prerogatives of the crown, and the command of &s;uch numerous military forces, there is no one but mu&s;t de&s;pair without EXTRAORDINARY EFFORTS, of being able to &s;upport our free government much longer under all the&s;e di&s;advantages."</P>
<P>But why &s;hould not '<HI>extraordinary efforts</HI>' be made, when the object is extraordinary&mdash; no le&s;s than the pre&s;ervation of human happi|ne&s;s, by the pre&s;ervation of civil liberty? No efforts &s;hould be declined in &s;uch a cau&s;e; nor &s;hould MEN, &s;en&s;ible of their ble&s;&s;ings, and de&s;irous of handing them down as they recei|ved them, &s;ink, with da&s;tardly indolence, into a &s;tate of de&s;pair.</P>
<P>Mr. Hume, with all his penetration, could not fore&s;ee the revolution in France; and how much the e&s;tabli&s;hment of liberty, in that exten&s;ive and enlightened country, would con|tribute to defeat the purpo&s;e of de&s;pots in all the nations of Europe. It is certain that the minds of the <HI>people</HI> in all countries are opened to the light of truth, by the emancipation of four or five and twenty millions of men, from the &s;lavery of prejudice and arbitrary dominion. There is now very little occa&s;ion for that de&s;pair of pre&s;erving the freedom of the Briti&s;h govern|ment, if the people will but be true to their own cau&s;e. De&s;poti&s;m, in its la&s;t &s;truggles,
<PB N="273" REF="028936_0281_0FDD76FBA9EBC7F0">may make great e&s;&s;orts; but even they will exhau&s;t its &s;trengh, and accelerate its di&s;&s;olu|tion. Firmne&s;s and per&s;everance in the people will ultimately triumph over the unnatural exertions of de&s;poti&s;m, driven to madne&s;s by de&s;pair.</P>
<P>The &s;pirit of liberty, it has been &s;aid, is a &s;pirit of jealou&s;y. It ought to be ever-waking and circum&s;pect; for the &s;pirit of de&s;poti&s;m never &s;lumbers, but watches every opportunity to increa&s;e prerogative, and dimini&s;h popular authority. During tho&s;e late alarms which cowardly and &s;elfi&s;h ari&s;tocracy labored to dif|fu&s;e, in its panic fear for its own privileges, many in&s;tances occurred of men who would willingly have &s;acrificed all the boa&s;ted freedom of Engli&s;hmen, to the &s;ecurity which they flattered them&s;elves grandeur, titles, and riches would enjoy under an ab&s;olute government. Their pride was &s;tung to the quick, by the idea of equality, while their avarice trembled for their property, and their cowardice for their per&s;onal &s;afety. They &s;aw &s;pectres in the &s;hapes of Truth, Ju&s;tice, and Liberty, triumph|ing over an en&s;laved and deluded world; they knew that they had little intere&s;t or connection with &s;uch <HI>per&s;onages,</HI> and &s;huddered at their fancied approach. They &s;hrieked with terror; and would gladly have ha&s;tened to the greate&s;t de&s;pot on earth for protection. England had no de&s;pot on the throne to afford them an a&s;ylum; and therefore they placed all their hopes on the <HI>military</HI> arm. War was the cry;
<PB N="274" REF="028936_0282_0FDD76FD1B4B9C20">victory was &s;ure. Ba&s;tiles were already built in imagination, and chains fabricated for the millions that people the provinces of Gaul</P>
<P>Had it been po&s;&s;ible for the&s;e men to prevail, in the moment of their con&s;ternation, the &s;ceptre of England would have been converted by them into an iron rod, and its king into the <HI>grand monarque</HI> of the old French tyranny. De&s;poti&s;m, expelled from France, would have cro&s;&s;ed from Calais to Dover, and been received with open arms by devoted va&s;&s;als, the &s;lavi&s;h alarmi&s;ts of an Engli&s;h ari&s;tocracy. The free government of England might have found at this period, as Mr. Hume prophecies it will here after do, an ea&s;y death in ab&s;olute monarchy.</P>
<P>But though the high <HI>church and king alarm|i&s;ts</HI> did not &s;ucceed at that time, which &s;eemed au&s;picious to their de&s;igns, yet &s;till they continue on their po&s;ts, watching opportunities to infringe on liberty, to &s;educe the people from their love of it, and gradually to reconcile them to arbi|trary rule.</P>
<P>Strange as it is, as a moral phenomenon, that men &s;hould wi&s;h to be &s;laves, yet it is cer|tain, that the tribe of per&s;ons devoted to the pomp and power of uncontrolled royalty, whom I call Tories or Ari&s;tocrats, for want of a more appropriate and preci&s;e appellation, are &s;till extremely zealous to make our KING a far &s;uperior pot<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">tate than he is allowed to be by that REVOLUTION, which gives him all the royal rights he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, and places him on the throne.</P>
<P><PB N="275" REF="028936_0283_0FDD7702927D0840">
Many circum&s;tances favor the wi&s;hes of the&s;e per&s;ons; and nothing oppo&s;es them &s;o much as the French revolution, and tho&s;e liberal opinions on the rights and happine&s;s of man which begin to prevail, wherever courts and mini&s;ters have little influence. Among the circum&s;tances which flatter them mo&s;t with the exten&s;ion of royal power, the elevation of them&s;elves, and the depre&s;&s;ion of the people, is the intere&s;t which almo&s;t every man and woman in the nation po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es in the public funds, and which they are all taught to believe would be depre|ciated, or even annihilated, if the parliament were reformed, the people rein&s;tated in their rights, and the influence of the crown dimi|ni&s;hed.

<P>WHEN advocates addre&s;s each other at the bar, they always adopt the appel|lation of <HI>learned</HI> brother. There certainly is a nece&s;&s;ity for great learning in the profe&s;&s;ion of the long robe. But of what <HI>kind</HI> is the learning required? It is, undoubtedly of a kind very little connected with philo&s;ophy or enlarge|ment of the mind. It is, in its wide&s;t range, confined to local cu&s;toms, and the &s;tatutes of a &s;ingle nation. It pores upon the letter of the law, and &s;carcely dares to contemplate the &s;pirit. It is for the mo&s;t part employed in minute di&s;qui&s;itions, in finding exceptions, in &s;eeking &s;ubterfuges, and often in making the great eternal rules of equity give way to the literal meaning of a narrow and unju&s;t &s;tatute, framed by ignorant men in times little removed from barbari&s;m, and certainly both &s;lavi&s;h and &s;uper|&s;titious.</P>
<P>Is the <HI>education</HI> of profe&s;&s;ional and <HI>practi&s;ing</HI> lawyers particularly calculated to expand the intellect, or to fill the heart with &s;entiments of peculiar honor and genero&s;ity; &s;uch &s;enti|ments as alone can con&s;titute a worthy law|giver,
<PB N="279" REF="028936_0287_0FDD770C1A398BF8">and an all-accompli&s;hed &s;tate&s;man? Is it not confined to particular and minute objects, in&s;tead of taking in the whole horizon of human concernments? A few, and but a few, of tho&s;e who have ri&s;en to the fir&s;t honors and emoluments, have had a truly liberal education. The re&s;t have been trained either in the office of an attorney, or in &s;tudies and exerci&s;es that contribute no more to liberalize or improve the heart, than the copying of in&s;truments, the peru&s;al of &s;tatutes, the knowledge of <HI>forms.</HI> Some of the fine&s;t faculties of the human con|&s;titution, the imagination and &s;entimental affec|tions, have little room for play, where the eye and memory are chiefly concerned; and where the mind is obliged to labor in the trammels of di&s;mal formalities, like the hor&s;e in harne&s;s, dragging a heavy vehicle in the wheel-ruts made by tho&s;e who have gone before, without the liberty of deviation. A hard head, a cold unfeeling heart, with a tenacious memory, are likely to &s;ucceed be&s;t in &s;uch toil, which requires le&s;s of &s;peed than of patient plodding per&s;e|verance.</P>
<P>A dull man, trained in this dull manner, may become a very u&s;eful <HI>lawyer,</HI> and certainly de&s;erving of all the <HI>fees</HI> and emoluments of his profe&s;&s;ion. But does it follow, that he mu&s;t be a &s;tate&s;man, a &s;enator, a cabinet coun&s;ellor, &s;itted to determine on que&s;tions of peace and war, and to con&s;ult and promote the happine&s;s of human nature? A lawyer, by &s;ingular feli|city of genius and di&s;po&s;ition, may be fit for
<PB N="280" REF="028936_0288_0FDD77112ED038F0">the momentous ta&s;k; and I only a&s;k whether his <HI>education,</HI> and the &s;tudies and employments of his profe&s;&s;ion, are &s;uch as to render him <HI>pre-eminently</HI> a &s;tate&s;man, and director of the mea&s;ures of government? Becau&s;e he may, for a fee, plead &s;ucce&s;sfully on any &s;ide, con|duct a trial, and a&s;&s;i&s;t a jury in determining a que&s;tion of <HI>meum</HI> and <HI>tuum</HI> or may be able to expound a &s;tatute, is he <HI>therefore</HI> more likely than all others to <HI>frame</HI> laws of the mo&s;t <HI>bene|ficent</HI> kind, having a view, not to particular ca&s;es only, but to the general welfare? All his &s;tudies of juri&s;prudence have been <HI>merely</HI> for the &s;ake of lucre, and not free and di&s;inte|re&s;ted, like tho&s;e of the general &s;cholar, the philo&s;opher and philanthropi&s;t.</P>
<P>The lawyer has, however, better opportu|nities for <HI>di&s;playing</HI> his knowledge and abilities than the members of other profe&s;&s;ions. Men have recour&s;e to him on matters very dear to their hearts; matters of property. With the &s;agacity of a very moderate intellect, and a knowledge acquired by dint of mere labor and long practice, he may be able to tran&s;act their <HI>pecuniary</HI> bu&s;ine&s;s with &s;kill and &s;ucce&s;s. He becomes, therefore, a favorite with <HI>men of property</HI> in the nation, which, whenever cor|ruption prevails, will contribute much to pu&s;h any a&s;pirant up the ladder of promotion. He &s;oon pants for rewards extraneous to his pro|fe&s;&s;ion. It is not enough to be a judge or chancellor: he mu&s;t be a poor of the realm, a a coun&s;ellor of &s;tate, a chief director in the

<P>Men like the&s;e, emboldened by &s;ucce&s;s, and accu&s;tomed, from their earlie&s;t entrance into active life, to browbeat and overbear, a&s;&s;ume a right to guide the opinions of the &s;enate and the council in the mo&s;t important mea&s;ures of &s;tate. They become, in fact, the rulers of the nation; but owing their elevation to the favor of a <HI>court,</HI> and placing all their expectations of farther honors on its continuance, they become devoted to its purpo&s;es. They are, in fact, &s;till ATTORNIES AND SOLICITORS, ready to exert all their powers of &s;ophi&s;try, and to ex|hau&s;t all their &s;tores of chicanery, to defend the mea&s;ures of the mini&s;ter, by rendering law, as far as they can, a leaden rule. The old peers &s;it in &s;ilent admiration; while men, furni&s;hed with all the &s;ubtleties of practi&s;ing lawyers, long hackneyed and hardened in the paltry bu&s;ine&s;s of private individuals, pre&s;ume to dic|tate peace or war, to impede or prevent &s;alu|tary reform, and keep the church, the army, and the navy under their &s;upreme con|trol. Such is their habitual volubility and con|firmed a&s;&s;urance, that men of more liberal minds, but of le&s;s &s;elf-conceit and le&s;s notoriety, &s;tand in awe of them, and &s;uffer them, with

<P>In con&s;equence of this management, a <HI>whole profe&s;&s;ion,</HI> with few exceptions, extremely bu&s;y both with tongue and pen, is con&s;tantly enli&s;ted in the &s;ervice of a mini&s;ter.

<P>What is the con&s;equence to the <HI>people,</HI> the laborer, the manufacturer, the retail trader, to poor families with many children, women with &s;mall patrimonies, annuitants, dependents, and all the numerous train of per&s;ons who are compelled to live, as the common phra&s;e ex|pre&s;&s;es it, from <HI>hand to mouth?</HI> Their gains or means are <HI>fixed,</HI> and by no means ri&s;e with the ri&s;ing price of nece&s;&s;aries.

He is a <HI>whole&s;ale</HI> farmer, and will breed but few of the animals of the farm-yard, and tho&s;e only for his own family con&s;umption. His children are too proud to carry the productions of the hen-roo&s;t or dairy to the market. He &s;corns &s;uch <HI>little</HI> gains.

The neighboring ru&s;tics, who u&s;ed to be re&s;pectable, though little farmers, are now his day-laborers, begging to be employed by the great man who has engro&s;&s;ed and con&s;olidated half a dozen farms.

<HEAD>SECTION XXXVII. <HI>On the natural Tendency of making Judges and Crown Lawyers, Peers; of tran&s;lating Bi&s;hops and annexing Preferments to Bi&s;hopricks, in what is called,</HI> commendam.</HEAD>
<P>IF there is any part of the con&s;titution of England, in the prai&s;e of which eloquence may employ her mo&s;t glowing colors, without entrenching upon the con&s;ines of truth, it is the JUDICIAL part of it. The purity of public ju&s;tice in England, is unequalled in any country which the &s;un illuminates in his diurnal pro|gre&s;s. The rea&s;on is obvious. The <HI>verdict</HI> is given by juries of men u&s;ually beyond the reach of corruption. No mini&s;terial influence can de&s;cend to all the individuals, in middle and humble life, who may be called upon to &s;it in judgment, and ultimately decide, as jurors, on the property, the fame, and the life, of their fellow-citizens. We have lately had a mo&s;t glorious in&s;tance of the virtue of private citi|zens, exerci&s;ing this mo&s;t important office. The <HI>verdicts</HI> given in the &s;tate trials, in one thou|&s;and &s;even hundred and ninety-four, do <HI>more honor</HI> to the Briti&s;h character, than all the military exploits in the reign of George the Third. Such verdicts make our con&s;titution truly enviable to the nations of Europe. Twelve hone&s;t men, on each of the&s;e trials, proved to
<PB N="293" REF="028936_0301_0FDD77459E185498">the world, that no power, no authority, no terror, nor even the factitious rage of ari&s;to|cratical principles, which had been artfully fo&s;tered, could lead them to &s;werve from the right line of ju&s;tice. They <HI>feared God, but not man;</HI> and po&s;terity will <HI>honor</HI> them, when the names of &s;ubtle politicians, clothed with a brief but lucrative authority, if mentioned at all, &s;hall be mentioned with dete&s;tation. It was well ob&s;erved by a zealous and hone&s;t advocate on the occa&s;ion, that he could not <HI>de&s;pair</HI> of the ca&s;e, when it was brought from the corrupt to the uncorrupt part of the con&s;titution. The days of acquittal were the jubilees of truth, the triumphs of virtue; and, in a time of dejection, revived the hopes of patrioti&s;m and philanthropy.</P>
<P><HI>Official</HI> judges, not having the final determi|nation of the cau&s;e, but feeling the check of the JURIES, commonly conduct them&s;elves, even in <HI>&s;tate trials,</HI> with &s;ome degree of candor and moderation. Indeed, we are &s;o happy as to &s;ee men appointed to this office, in our time, who&s;e tried integrity gives rea&s;on to believe, that, if they were not thus wi&s;ely checked, they would, with <HI>few</HI> exceptions, pre&s;erve impar|tiality.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s, though much has been &s;aid on the independence of judges, and though great prai&s;e is due to our king, who placed them in their offices for life, and not removable at his plea&s;ure, yet it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that there &s;till remain temptations, which might have great
<PB N="294" REF="028936_0302_0FDD7746C9350670">influence on men le&s;s virtuous than our <HI>pre&s;ent</HI> judges are. It is ob&s;erved, that PEERAGES, in modern times, have been be&s;towed, with peculiar bounty, on lawyers; and &s;ome have ventered to &s;ay, that the expectation of this &s;plendid reward may fru&s;trate all endeavors to &s;ecure, e&s;pecially in <HI>&s;tate trials,</HI> the perfect independence of the judges who pre&s;ide. It is not enough that they do not fear <HI>removal</HI> from their dignified office. Their <HI>hopes</HI> may influ|ence, more than their <HI>fears.</HI> They may <HI>hope</HI> to add to opulence the dignity of family di&s;tinc|tion, e&s;cutcheons, coronets, and hereditary &s;eats in the legi&s;lature. If them&s;elves have &s;een too much of the vanity and folly of worldly pomp to admire it, (which, however, is not often the ca&s;e with men who may be great lawyers, with|out any philo&s;ophy or religion,) yet they may have &s;ons, wives, daughters, relatives, and friends, to whom the &s;plendor of life, (as <HI>they</HI> have, po&s;&s;ibly, little <HI>&s;olid</HI> merit,) is valuable in the <HI>highe&s;t</HI> degree. A peerage is therefore, for the mo&s;t part, a very powerful allurement, I will not &s;ay, to di&s;gui&s;e the truth or pervert the law, but ob&s;equiou&s;ly to &s;eek mini&s;terial favor.</P>
<P>When peerages are lavi&s;hed on lawyers high in place, it is a circum&s;tance viewed with &s;ome degree of jealou&s;y by tho&s;e who are willing to guard con&s;titutional liberty with unwinking vigilance. Perhaps it might afford &s;atisfaction to &s;uch men, if judges were by law <HI>excluded</HI> from all higher elevation; if they were indeed <HI>mo&s;t amply</HI> paid and mo&s;t re&s;pectfully revered;
<PB N="295" REF="028936_0303_0FDD7748229B19B0">but, for the &s;ake of preventing the po&s;&s;ibility of a wrong bias, where the happine&s;s of the people is mo&s;t intimately concerned, were pre|vented from viewing a brilliant dazzling coro|net, &s;u&s;pended as their <HI>reward,</HI> over the &s;cales of ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>But here an objector will urge, with &s;erious &s;olicitude, that, as the Hou&s;e of Lords is a court of judicature, in the la&s;t re&s;ort, a court of appeal from every court in the kingdom, it is nece&s;&s;ary that it &s;hould be well &s;upplied with lawyers of eminence.</P>
<P>On this &s;ubject Mr. PALEY &s;ays; "There appears to be nothing in the con&s;titution of the Hou&s;e of Lords; in the education, habits, character, or profe&s;&s;ions of the members who compo&s;e it; in the mode of their appointment, or the right by which they &s;ucceed to their places in it, that &s;hould qualify them for their arduous office; except, <HI>perhaps,</HI> that the ele|vation of their rank and fortune affords a &s;ecu|rity again&s;t the offer and influence of SMALL bribes. Officers of the army and navy, cour|tiers, eccle&s;ia&s;tics; young men who have ju&s;t attained the age of twenty-one, and who have pa&s;&s;ed their youth in the di&s;&s;ipation and pur|&s;uits which commonly accompany the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion or inheritance of great fortunes; country gen|tlemen, occupied in the management of their e&s;tates, or in the care of their dome&s;tic concerns and family intere&s;ts; the GREATER part of the a&s;&s;embly <HI>born to their &s;tation,</HI> that is, placed in it by CHANCE; mo&s;t of the re&s;t advanced
<PB N="296" REF="028936_0304_0FDD7749B54F2010">to the peerage for &s;ervices and from motives <HI>utterly</HI> unconnected with legal erudition;&mdash; <HI>the&s;e men</HI> compo&s;e the tribunal to which the con&s;titution entru&s;ts the interpretation of her laws, and the ultimate deci&s;ion of every di&s;pute between her &s;ubjects!"</P>
<P>From this <HI>very degrading</HI> repre&s;entation of the Hou&s;e of Lords, the Reverend Archdeacon proceeds to ju&s;tify the practice of con&s;tantly placing in it, &s;ome of the mo&s;t eminent and experienced lawyers in the kingdom. He would, I think, with more propriety have argued again&s;t rendering one part of the <HI>legi&s;|lature</HI> a court of ju&s;tice, de&s;igned both to make and execute the laws; becau&s;e every &s;olid politician has agreed in the propriety of keep|ing the legi&s;lative and judicial powers as &s;epa|rate and as di&s;tant from each other as it is po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>I leave this point for the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of future political writers, and &s;atisfy my&s;elf with &s;ug|ge&s;ting, that it is nece&s;&s;ary to the perfect contentment of a people jealous of their liberty and the purity of judicial proceedings, that all temptations whatever &s;hould be removed from the &s;ight of frail human beings, &s;itting in the &s;eat of judgment, which may lead them to court the favor of ruling powers at the expence of ju&s;tice. It is not MONEY alone which BRIBES. Title and rank have more influence on the uni|ver&s;al pa&s;&s;ion, <HI>vanity;</HI> e&s;pecially when avarice has been already gratified with ample &s;alaries and the emoluments of a lucrative profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="297" REF="028936_0305_0FDD774F130BE678">
The con&s;ideration of the <HI>po&s;&s;ible</HI> rewards which may dimini&s;h the independence of <HI>judges,</HI> naturally leads to the con&s;ideration of tho&s;e which may <HI>&s;ecularize</HI> the <HI>bi&s;hops,</HI> and injure the cau&s;e of religion, for <HI>which alone</HI> epi&s;copacy it&s;elf could be e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>
<P>But, as this is a &s;ubject of &s;ome delicacy, I &s;hall u&s;e the authority and words of Dr. Wat&s;on, the pre&s;ent Bi&s;hop of <HI>Llandaff,</HI> who, having been in the minority at the time he wrote upon it, ventured to &s;peak the <HI>whole</HI> truth, with that freedom which becomes an hone&s;t man in every rank, and is particularly expected from a Chri&s;tian bi&s;hop.</P>
<P>"I know," &s;ays Bi&s;hop Wat&s;on, "That many will be &s;tartled. I beg them not to be offended, at the &s;urmi&s;e of the bi&s;hops not being independent in the Hou&s;e of Lords; and it would be ea&s;y enough to weave a <HI>logical cob|web,</HI> large enough and &s;trong enough to cover and protect the conduct of the Right Reverend Bench from the attacks of tho&s;e who di&s;like epi&s;copacy. This, I &s;ay, would be an ea&s;y ta&s;k; but it is far above my ability to eradi|cate from the minds of others (who are, notwith&s;tanding, as well attached to the church e&s;tabli&s;hment as our&s;elves,) a SUSPI|CION THAT THE PROSPECT OF BEING TRANS|LATED <HI>influences the minds</HI> of the BISHOPS too powerfully, and induces them to pay too great an attention to the BECK of a <HI>mini&s;ter.</HI> The &s;u&s;picion, whether well or ill founded, is <HI>di&s;reputable to our order;</HI> and, what is of wor&s;e
<PB N="298" REF="028936_0306_0FDD775079DF6248">con&s;equence, it hinders us from doing that good which we otherwi&s;e might do; for the laity, while they entertain &s;uch a &s;u&s;picion concerning us, will accu&s;e us of avarice and ambition, of making a <HI>gain of godline&s;s,</HI> of <HI>bartering the dignity of our office</HI> for the <HI>chance</HI> of a TRANS|LATION.</P>
<P>"In&s;tead then, (proceeds the Bi&s;hop), of <HI>quibbling</HI> and di&s;puting again&s;t the exi&s;tence of <HI>mini&s;ters influence over</HI> us, or recriminating and retorting the petulance of tho&s;e who accu&s;e us on that account, let us endeavor to remove the evil; or, if it <HI>mu&s;t not</HI> be admitted that this evil has any real exi&s;tence, let us endeavor to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">emove the <HI>appearance</HI> of it.</P>
<P>"The di&s;parity of income and pat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">onage might be made &s;o &s;mall, or &s;o apportioned to the labors, that few bi&s;hops would be di&s;po&s;ed to wi&s;h for tran&s;lations; and con&s;equently the bi&s;hops would, in <HI>appearance</HI> as well as in <HI>reality,</HI> be INDEPENDENT.</P>
<P>"But, in rendering the bi&s;hops indepen|dent, you will reduce the power of the crown in the Hou&s;e of Lords.&mdash;I do not mean to deny this charge; nay, I am willing to admit it in it's full extent.&mdash;The influence of the crown, when exerted by the cabinet over the public coun&s;ellors of the king, is a circum&s;tance &s;o far from being to be wi&s;hed by his true friends, that it is as dangerous to the real intere&s;ts and honor of the crown it&s;elf, as it is odious to the people, and DESTRUCTIVE OF PUBLIC LIBERTY.</P>

<P>"I cannot admit the circum&s;tance of the bi&s;hops being rendered <HI>independent</HI> in the Hou&s;e of Lords, as any real objection to the plan pro|po&s;ed; on the contrary, I think it a very &s;trong argument in its favor; &s;o &s;trong an one that, if there was no other, it would be &s;ufficient to &s;anctify the mea&s;ure."</P>
<P>The corruption of the church for the pur|po&s;e of corrupting the legi&s;lature, is an offence far more injurious to the general happine&s;s of mankind and the intere&s;ts of a Chri&s;tian com|munity, than any of tho&s;e which have bani&s;hed the offenders to Botany Bay, or confined them for years within the walls of the pri&s;on-hou&s;e. Both the corruptors and the corrupted, in this ca&s;e, are more injurious to Chri&s;tianity than all the tribe of &s;ceptics and infidels; than Tin|dal, Toland, Bolingbroke, Hume, Rou&s;&s;eau, Voltaire, and Gibbon. The <HI>common people</HI> do not <HI>read</HI> them, and perhaps could &s;carcely <HI>under&s;tand</HI> them. But the common people <HI>do</HI> read the new&s;papers daily, and &s;ee the names

They mu&s;t therefore entertain a SUSPICION, as the Bi&s;hop of Llandaff expre&s;&s;es it, that reli|gion it&s;elf, as well as its official, opulent, dig|nified &s;upporters, is but an in&s;trument of &s;tate, a tool in the hand of a mini&s;ter. They mu&s;t naturally con&s;ider <HI>venalty</HI> as <HI>doubly</HI> ba&s;e, when clothed in the &s;anctified robes of religion. What has happened in France, in con&s;equence of the corruptions of the church by the &s;tate, ought to afford a &s;triking admonition.</P>
<P>I wi&s;h to point out, in <HI>the&s;e times, writings</HI> of LIVING BISHOPS in favor of Chri&s;tianity, becau&s;e they would be oppo&s;ed with the be&s;t grace again&s;t the writings of LIVING INFIDELS. But, to the reproach of my want of intelligence, I know not the names of the majority, till I find them in the COURT CALENDAR. The printed works of even this <HI>majority</HI> I cannot find, either in the &s;hops or the libraries: the few I do find, even of the <HI>minority,</HI> are not adapted to the wants of the people at large. Their <HI>occa&s;ional</HI> &s;ermons, after they have &s;erved their <HI>day</HI> become, like almanacks, out of date: a collection of old <HI>court calendars</HI> would be nearly as edifying and more entertaining to the multitude.</P>
<P>It is indeed certain, that the archiepi&s;copal mitres received more lu&s;tre than they gave, from the &s;ermons of Dr. Tillot&s;on and Dr. Seeker. It would give me plea&s;ure to place the &s;ermons of LIVING ARCHBISHOPS by their
<PB N="301" REF="028936_0309_0FDD775AE97AFCF0">&s;ide; and I would mention them had they come to my knowledge. The &s;ermons, however, of the <HI>few</HI> living bi&s;hops who are <HI>known</HI> at all to the PUBLIC will, I hope, prove to mankind, that &s;ome among the bi&s;hops, in this happy i&s;le, do not think it a &s;ufficient return for princely revenues, to <HI>vote always with a mini&s;ter,</HI> or to increa&s;e, with lawn &s;leeves, the pageantry of a birth-day. To perform the occa&s;ional duties of ordination, confirmation, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i&s;itation, cannot &s;atisfy the minds of men who receive the honors and emoluments of Durham, WIN|CHESTER, York, or Canterbury. That it is &s;o, is happy; for if ever the prelatical clergy &s;hould be SUSPECTED of becoming merely mini&s;terial in&s;truments; if, for in&s;tance, they &s;hould ever be &s;uppo&s;ed &s;o far &s;ecularized, as to concede to the mini&s;ter that made them bi&s;hops, the right of nominating to all the mo&s;t valuable preferments in their gift, in order to enable <HI>him</HI> the better to corrupt that parlia|ment in which them&s;elves al&s;o have engaged to give a VENAL VOTE; from that time, they would contribute more to the downfal of the church, than all the writings of all the unbe|lievers, from Frederic, late King of Pru&s;&s;ia, to the American Republican, Thomas Paine. The <HI>&s;in of &s;imony</HI> in a private man, who pays a <HI>fair price</HI> for a profitable appointment, with his <HI>own</HI> money, hone&s;tly earned by virtuous indu&s;try, and <HI>does the duties of it,</HI> is as nothing when compared to the <HI>&s;imony</HI> of him who buys a high and important &s;tation, greatly lucrative, with

<P>The bi&s;hops, in their charges, are now founding an alarm. They very ju&s;tly affirm, that the exi&s;tence of Chri&s;tianity is now in dan|ger.

One of the infirmities mo&s;t acknowledged and lamented is, a tendency to ru&s;h from one extreme to another; a pronene&s;s to fall into a <HI>vice,</HI> in the de&s;ire of e&s;caping an <HI>error.</HI> Thus the dete&s;tation of de&s;potion and the love of liberty, both of them rational and laudable, have led many to factious and violent conduct, which neither the occa&s;ion ju&s;tified, nor prudence would <HI>precipitately</HI> adopt, even if the occa&s;ion might appear to ju&s;tify them.</P>
<P>From faction and violence in the cau&s;e of liberty, which di&s;grace the cau&s;e it&s;elf, and give advantage to the favorers of arbitrary power, I <HI>mo&s;t anxiou&s;ly di&s;&s;uade</HI> all who love mankind and their country. Faction and violence are de&s;potic in the extreme. They bring all evils of tyranny, without any con&s;olation, but that they are u&s;ually tran&s;ient; whereas tyranny is durable. They de&s;troy them&s;elves, or are de&s;troyed by force in the hands of a &s;uperior
<PB N="305" REF="028936_0313_0FDD776B002AD8C0">power. In either ca&s;e, much is <HI>lo&s;t</HI> to the cau&s;e of liberty; becau&s;e the per&s;ons who have been betrayed by their pa&s;&s;ions into exce&s;&s;es, were probably <HI>&s;incere;</HI> and if they had been al&s;o <HI>di&s;creet</HI> and moderate would have been effectual as well as zealous promoters of the public good. It is certain, that very hone&s;t men are very apt to be betrayed into violence by their warmth of temper. They mean good, and do ill. They become the in&s;truments of di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate knaves; and are often led into extravagances by the very party again&s;t whom they act, in order that they may be expo&s;ed, and become obnoxious to cen&s;ure.</P>
<P>Wi&s;dom is gentle, deliberate, cautious. Nothing violent is durable. I hope the lovers of liberty will &s;hew the &s;incerity of their attach|ment by the wi&s;dom of their conduct. Tumul|tuary proceedings always exhibit &s;ome appear|ance of in&s;anity. A blow &s;truck with blind violence may in&s;lic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> a wound or a brui&s;e, but it may fall in the wrong place; it may even injure the hand that gives it, by its own ill-directed force.</P>
<P>Man being a rea&s;onable creature, will always &s;ubmit to rea&s;on, if you give time for his pa&s;&s;ions to cool, and wait for the <HI>mollia tem|pora fandi,</HI> the proper opportunities of addre&s;|&s;ing him. A FEW, in the great ma&s;s of man|kind, may be corrupted by views of intere&s;t, by expectations of preferment, by bribes, and by titles. But there are not rewards enough of this kind to corrupt the whole body of any
<PB N="306" REF="028936_0314_0FDD776C29BE0900">people. The great body of the people will follow that which appears to them right, and ju&s;t, and true. Let it be clearly laid before them, and left for their calm con&s;ideration. If it &s;hould &s;o happen, which is very unlikely, that they &s;hould not adopt it, after under&s;tand|ing it, and duly weighing its importance, then they mu&s;t be left to the error of their ways. <HI>Si populus vult decipi, decipiatur.</HI> If the people will be deluded, they mu&s;t be &s;o. Force can|not eradicate error, though it may de&s;troy life. Riot, tumult, turbulence may do great mi&s;|chief, but they carry no conviction.</P>
<P>Inflammatory language at popular meetings is to be avoided; and, indeed, multitudes of the <HI>lowe&s;t</HI> of the people are not to be wantonly convened. Without in the lea&s;t impeaching their rights, it mu&s;t be allowed that their pa&s;|&s;ions are too violent, when heated by colli&s;ion with each other, and their judgments too weak, when not previou&s;ly informed by reading and education, to act wi&s;ely when met in a large body, without authori&s;ed guides, and without &s;trict regulation. A man who is a &s;incere patriot, and not a <HI>mere demagogue</HI> for &s;ini&s;ter purpo&s;es, will be cautious of a&s;&s;embling crowds of the lowe&s;t of the people. Lord George Gordon's unfortnate conduct has left a la&s;ting le&s;&s;on. He, I firmly believe, intended none of that mi&s;chief which en&s;ued; but who can &s;ay to the waves of a troubled &s;ea, "thus far &s;hall ye go, and no farther?" I know, and have already commented on, the advantage taken from tho&s;e
<PB N="307" REF="028936_0315_0FDD776DEFA7C4A0">riots by the friends of high-prerogative doc|rines, for di&s;paraging the <HI>people</HI> at large, not|with&s;tanding the people certainly had no con|cern in them.</P>
<P>Though decidedly a friend to the reform of the Hou&s;e of Commons, I cannot agree with the Duke of Richmond in the propriety of univer&s;al &s;uffrage. I think his idea perfectly Utopian. Sir Thomas More never wrote any thing more vi&s;ionary in his celebrated fiction; Sir Robert Filmer nothing more adver&s;e to <HI>real</HI> liberty. Univer&s;al &s;uffrage, I fear, would cau&s;e univer&s;al confu&s;ion; and the friends of mankind would be inclined to fly for temporary refuge even to the throne of a DESPOT. Per|&s;ons in a &s;tate of <HI>&s;ervitude</HI> could never be expected to give a <HI>free</HI> vote; and vagabonds and paupers would u&s;e their <HI>liberty for a cloke of maliciou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> I wi&s;h the right of &s;uffrage to be extended <HI>as far as it po&s;&s;ibly can,</HI> without endangering public order and tranquillity; but <HI>extreme</HI> ignorance and <HI>extreme</HI> penury cannot with prudence be tru&s;ted with a power which both requires <HI>knowledge</HI> and commands <HI>pro|perty.</HI></P>
<P>But whatever politicians may determine upon this point, I think it certain, that debates upon it connot be held in very large a&s;&s;emblies, into which, not only the lowe&s;t but the vile&s;t of mankind are allowed admi&s;&s;ion, and all the privileges of coun&s;ellors, <HI>de &s;umma rerum,</HI> on matters of the highe&s;t importance, without extreme danger of violating law, and di&s;tur|bing
<PB N="308" REF="028936_0316_0FDD77730E8E5568">that order which is nec&s;&s;ary to comfort and &s;ecurity.</P>
<P>I wi&s;h, therefore, that all preliminary con|&s;ultation on this point, and all points like this, may be conducted by <HI>writing,</HI> by appeals to rea&s;on in the <HI>clo&s;et,</HI> and that a con&s;iderable time may be allowed to cool all intemperate heats; and give <HI>&s;olidity</HI> to the materials of the intend|ed repair. At county meetings or a&s;&s;ociations, I would have the civil power in full force; but never the military. The &s;taff of the con&s;table &s;hould be more coercive than the &s;abre of the dragoon; for the con&s;titution admits the one as its own, but certainly looks at the other with horror. Every tumult, productive of mi&s;chief, gives the friends of arbitrary power an oppor|tunity for introducing the military, of arguing again&s;t all <HI>popular</HI> interference in that very government which the <HI>people</HI> &s;upport by their indu&s;try, and which, according to the law of God, nature, and rea&s;on, they have a right to control by their &s;upreme authority. There may be ca&s;es of the la&s;t nece&s;&s;ity, which I &s;hud|der to think of, in which nothing but the power of the people, acting by force, can maintain or recover their u&s;urped rights. Such mu&s;t occur but &s;eldom. May our country never experi|ence them!</P>
<P>There can be no good rea&s;on a&s;&s;igned why government &s;hould not be, like every thing el&s;e, continually advancing to all the perfection of which it is capable. Indeed, as the hap|pine&s;s of mankind depends more upon well-regulated
<PB N="309" REF="028936_0317_0FDD77747B65FA78">and well-admini&s;tered government, than on any thing &s;ubordinate in life or in arts, there is every rea&s;on for be&s;towing all the time which every pa&s;&s;ing generation can be&s;tow, in bringing government to its utmo&s;t point of attainable perfection. It is the bu&s;ine&s;s and the duty of tho&s;e who now live, as they value their own happine&s;s and the happine&s;s of their po&s;terity, to labor in the reform of abu&s;es, and the farther improvement of every improveable advantage.

No; encouragements are held out for improvement in all arts and &s;ciences, conducive to the comfort and accommodation of human life. What, then, in the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> art, the art of diffu&s;ing happine&s;s throughout nations, &s;hall he who attempts improvement be &s;tigma|tized as an innovator, pro&s;ecuted as a &s;editious intermeddler, and per&s;ecuted with the re&s;ent|ment of tho&s;e who find their advantage in the continuance of error, and the diffu&s;ion of abu&s;e and corruption?

<P>YOU &s;eldom meet with infidelity in a cottage. You find evil and mi&s;ery there, as in palaces; but you do not find infidelity. The poor love the name and religion of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. And they have rea&s;on to love them, if they only con&s;idered the obligations they are under to them for <HI>worldly</HI> comfort, for liberty, for in&s;truction, for a due con&s;ideration in civil &s;ociety.</P>
<P>The rights of man, to mention which is almo&s;t criminal in the eyes of de&s;potical &s;yco|phants, are plainly and irre&s;i&s;tibly e&s;tabli&s;hed in the go&s;pel. There is no doubt but that all his creatures are dear to the Creator and Re|deemer; but yet, from motives of mercy and compa&s;&s;ion, there is an evident predilection for the POOR, manife&s;ted in our Saviour's preaching and mini&s;try. The&s;e are very &s;triking words: "The blind receive their &s;ight, and the lame walk; the l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">pers are clean&s;ed, and the deaf hear; the dead are rai&s;ed up, and the POOR HAVE THE GOSPEL PREACHED TO THEM." The in&s;truction, the con&s;olation, the enlightening of the POOR, are placed with the
<PB N="312" REF="028936_0320_0FDD777EC530A4D0">greate&s;t of his miracles, the recu&s;citation of extingui&s;hed life. Who, indeed, did trouble them&s;elves to care for the <HI>poor,</HI> till JESUS CHRIST &s;et the glorious example? It was a <HI>miraculous</HI> thing, in the eye of the <HI>world,</HI> that a <HI>divine</HI> teacher &s;hould addre&s;s him&s;elf particularly to tho&s;e who could not reward him with a worldly recompence! But he came to de&s;troy that INE|QUALITY among mankind, which enabled the rich and great to treat the poor as bea&s;ts of burden. He him&s;elf cho&s;e the condition of poverty, to &s;hew the rich and proud of how little e&s;timation are the trifles they doat upon, in the eye of him who made them, and who can de&s;troy them at his plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>Let us hear HIM open his divine commi&s;&s;ion. The words are very comfortable, e&s;pecially after reading the hi&s;tories of the tyrants who have br<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i&s;ed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ankind with their rods of iron. We find them in the fourth chapter of St. Luke.</P>
<P>"<HI>And there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet E&s;aias; and when he had opened the book, he found the place wherein it was written:</HI></P>
<P>"THE SPIRIT OF THE LORD IS UPON ME, BECAUSE HE HATH APPOINTED ME TO PREACH THE GOSPEL TO THE POOR; HE HATH SENT ME TO HEAL THE BROKEN|HEARTED, TO PREACH DELIVERANCE TO THE CAPTIVES, AND RECOVERY OF SIGHT TO THE BLIND; TO SET AT LIBERTY THEM THAT ARE BRUISED;</P>
<P><PB N="313" REF="028936_0321_0FDD777F9CC63600">
"TO PREACH THE ACCEPTABLE YEAR OF THE LORD.</P>
<P>"And he clo&s;ed the book, and he gave it again to the mini&s;ter, and &s;at down, and the eyes of all them that were in the &s;ynagogue were fa&s;tened on him.</P>
<P>"And he began to &s;ay unto them, This day is the &s;cripture fulfilled in your ears.</P>
<P>"And all bare him witne&s;s, and wondered at the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth: and they &s;aid, IS NOT THIS JOSEPH's SON?"</P>
<P>&mdash;And &s;oon after, "All they in the &s;yna|gogue were filled with wrath, and ro&s;e up, and thru&s;t him out of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e city, and led him unto the brow of the hill, (whereon their city was built), that they might ca&s;t him down head|long."</P>
<P>Thus their <HI>ari&s;tocratical</HI> prejudices prevailed over the fir&s;t &s;trong feelings of gratitude and grace. The &s;pirit of ari&s;tocracy di&s;played it&s;elf here its in its genuine colors; in pride, cruelty, and violence. Many of the &s;cribes (the law|yers) and phari&s;ees were probably in the &s;yna|gogue, and their influence &s;oon prevailed on the people to &s;hew their impotent malice again&s;t their be&s;t friend and benefactor. In all ages, &s;omething of the &s;ame kind is ob&s;ervable. The proud &s;upporters of tyranny, in which they hope to partake, have always u&s;ed fal&s;e alarms, fal&s;e plots, cunningly-contrived nicknames and watchwords, to &s;et the unthinking people
<PB N="314" REF="028936_0322_0FDD77851A5EBB80">again&s;t tho&s;e who were promoting their great|e&s;t good.</P>
<P>When Chri&s;t began to preach, we read, in the &s;eventh chapter of St. Luke, that the mul|titude and the publicans heard him; but the &s;cribes and the phari&s;ees <HI>rejected</HI> the coun&s;el of God towards them. They, like all per&s;ons of &s;imilar temper and rank, flouri&s;hing by abu&s;es, could not bear <HI>innovation.</HI></P>
<P>The mo&s;t powerful argument they u&s;ed again&s;t him was this que&s;tion:&mdash;HAVE ANY OF THE RULERS AND THE PHARISEES BE|LIEVED IN HIM? In modern times the que&s;|tion would have been, Have any per&s;ons of fa&s;hion and di&s;tinction given countenance to him? Does my lord&mdash;or my lady&mdash;or Sir Harry go to hear him preach?&mdash;Or is he &s;ome|body whom nobody knows?&mdash;Such is the lan|guage of the &s;pirit of de&s;poti&s;m, in all times and countries.</P>
<P>THREE HUNDRED YEARS elap&s;ed, in con|&s;equence of the&s;e prejudices, before the go&s;pel was recognized and received at COURT. And I am &s;orry to &s;ay that the COURT &s;oon cor|rupted its &s;implicity. The pride of life, always prevalent among tho&s;e who a&s;&s;ume to them|&s;elves good things enough to &s;upport and com|fort thou&s;ands of individuals equally de&s;erving, could never brook the doctrines of Chri&s;t, which favored liberty and equality. It there|fore &s;educed the Chri&s;tians to a participation of power and grandeur; and the poor, with
<PB N="315" REF="028936_0323_0FDD7786842C8310">their rights, were often forgotten, in the mo&s;t &s;plendid periods of eccle&s;ia&s;tical pro&s;perity. Many nominal Chri&s;tians have been, and are, as ari&s;tocratical as Herod and the chief prie&s;ts and phari&s;ees of Judea.</P>
<P>But the authority of Je&s;us Chri&s;t him&s;elf mu&s;t have more weight with Chri&s;tians, than all the pomp and parade of the mo&s;t ab&s;olute de&s;pots in Europe, at the head of the fine&s;t troops in the univer&s;e. He taught us, when we pray, to &s;ay, <HI>Our Father.</HI> This alone is &s;ufficient to e&s;tabli&s;h, on an immoveable ba&s;is, the equality of human beings. All are bound to call upon and con&s;ider God as their Father, if they are Chri&s;tians; and, as there are no rights of primogeniture in Heaven, all are equal brothers and &s;i&s;ters, coheirs, if they do not forfeit their hopes, of a ble&s;&s;ed immortality. But the&s;e are doctrines which the great and proud cannot admit. This world is theirs, and they cannot bear that the beggar, the &s;ervant, the &s;lave, &s;hould be their equal. We can hardly &s;uppo&s;e, in imagination, the Empre&s;s of Ru&s;&s;ia, the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, the Emperor of Germany, or any <HI>grandee</HI> with a riband, a garter, or a &s;tar, kneeling down, and from his <HI>heart</HI> acknowledging, in his <HI>prayer,</HI> a poor private in a marching regiment, a poor wretch in a workhou&s;e, or the &s;ervant that rides behind his carriage, a <HI>brother.</HI> So void of rea&s;on and religion is a poor helple&s;s mortal, when dre&s;t in a little brief authority by the
<PB N="316" REF="028936_0324_0FDD778803203F48">folly of tho&s;e who &s;ubmit to be trampled under foot by their equal; a man born of a woman, like them&s;elves, and doomed like them&s;elves after &s;trutting on the &s;tage a few years, to the grave. Our Saviour, with a wi&s;dom far above all the re&s;inement of philo&s;ophy, frequently inculcated the vanity of riches and power, and the real pre-eminence of virtue.</P>
<P>And what &s;ay the <HI>apo&s;tles?</HI> Do they favor tho&s;e who u&s;urp an unnatural and unrea&s;on|able power over their fellow-mortals, for the &s;ake of gratifying their own &s;elfi&s;h vanity and avarice? Let us hear them.</P>
<P>St. Paul, in the fir&s;t chapter of the Fir&s;t Epi&s;tle to the Co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">thians, &s;ays, "You &s;ee your calling, brethren, how that not many wi&s;e men after the fle&s;h, (worldly-wi&s;e men,) not many <HI>mighty,</HI> not many <HI>noble</HI> are called."</P>
<P>In the &s;econd chapter of &s;he Epi&s;tle of St. James, we read,</P>
<P>"Has not God cho&s;en the poor of this world to be heirs of his kingdom?" To which is added,</P>
<P>"The RICH MEN bla&s;pheme that worthy name by which ye are called."</P>
<P>The&s;e pa&s;&s;ages afford a very &s;trong argu|ment of the truth and divinity of the Chri&s;tian religion, for they contain the very doctrines which were foretold &s;everal hundred years be|fore the appearance of Chri&s;tianity. ISAIAH, in his twenty-ninth chapter, &s;peaking of the go&s;pel, and its doctrines and effects, expre&s;sly &s;ays,</P>

"The <HI>meek</HI> &s;hall increa&s;e their joy in the Lord; and the POOR AMONG MEN SHALL REJOICE IN THE HOLY ONE OF ISRAEL."</P>
<P>The inference I would draw from all that has preceded, is, that the middle ranks and the poor, that is, the great majority of man|kind, &s;hould place a due value on the go&s;pel, not only for its religious, but al&s;o its civil and political advantages. It is the GRAND CHAR|TER OF THEIR FREEDOM, their independence, their equality. All the &s;ubtilty of lawyers, all the &s;ophi&s;try of mini&s;terial orators, all the power of all the de&s;pots and ari&s;tocrats in the world, cannot annihilate RIGHTS, given, in|deed by <HI>Nature,</HI> but plainly confirmed by the <HI>Go&s;pel.</HI> The words already cited, are too clear and explicit to admit of mi&s;con&s;truction. JESUS CHRIST came to put an end to unju&s;t inequality in this world, while he revealed the pro&s;pect of another, where the <HI>wicked cea&s;e from troubling, and the weary are at re&s;t.</HI> O ye people, give not the tyrants &s;uch an advantage as to part with your go&s;pel. Pre&s;erve it, watch over it, as the pearl of great price. It is your &s;ecurity for pre&s;ent and future felicity. Other Herods, other Neros may ari&s;e, who will rejoice to &s;ee you voluntarily renounce a &s;y&s;tem which mili|tates again&s;t their diabolical rule; rejoice to &s;ee you give up that which all the per&s;ecution of the ancient Herods and Neros in vain attempted to aboli&s;h by &s;hedding blood.</P>
<P>I think it may be depended on as indi&s;pu|table, that men who endeavor to &s;uppre&s;s all

<P>The &s;pirit of de&s;poti&s;m is remarkably vi&s;ible in the <HI>mau&s;olcum.</HI> There are families who &s;eem to think that their precious bones would be contaminated, even if depo&s;ited in the con&s;e|crated cemeteries of the church, where ple|beians &s;leep, and therefore they erect proud temples in their private domains, where their fathers may rot in &s;tate, unapproached by the vulgar. If they were illu&s;trious inventors of arts and benefactors to mankind, the di&s;tinction might be a ju&s;t compliment to their memory, and a u&s;eful incentive to emulation. But the per&s;ons thus magnificently interred are u&s;ually the mo&s;t in&s;ignificant of the human race; who&s;e very names would not be known a year after their decea&s;e if they were not deeply engraven on the marble.</P>
<P>Many an <HI>alderman,</HI> notorious for the meane&s;t avarice, as little di&s;tingui&s;hed for beneficence as abilities, is decorated with the mo&s;t &s;umptu|ous memorials which the <HI>&s;tone-cutter</HI> can rai&s;e for money; while <HI>Milton</HI> the glory of the nation, a man elevated above the rank of com|mon humanity, had no monumental marble. But all that the herald's office can effect, all that can be done by painting, gilding, and marble, cannot ennoble the greate&s;t favorite of a court, the mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful adventurer in the Fa&s;t Indies, or the mo&s;t opulent contractor and
<PB N="321" REF="028936_0329_0FDD779274065FE8">money-lender, like a Paradi&s;e Lo&s;t. The nabobs find their influence cannot &s;ecure the <HI>e&s;teem</HI> of a few contemporaries, though it may command their votes, much le&s;s of whole nations, and of late po&s;terity. Money, the only god which worldlings wor&s;hip, lo&s;es its omnipotence after the death of its po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or; and even the inheritor often de&s;pi&s;es the man who acquired it. The undertaker, the e&s;cutcheon painter, and the &s;culptor, are however employed to keep up the fal&s;e pageantry of in&s;ignificant opulence; and a hear&s;e, covered over with coats of arms, is u&s;ed for the purpo&s;e of impre&s;|&s;ing the vulgar with a veneration for rank and riches, while, in the minds of men of &s;en&s;e, it excites ridicule, and converts a funeral into a farce.</P>
<P>Indeed the empty parade of pride, and the &s;elf-importance of de&s;poti&s;m it&s;elf, might fur|ni&s;h a laughable entertainment, if it were not productive of mi&s;chief, mi&s;ery, and blood&s;hed. To &s;upport the vanity, exclu&s;ive privileges, and high preten&s;ions of tho&s;e who have little per|&s;onal merit or &s;ervices to recommend them to &s;ociety, it is nece&s;&s;ary to have recour&s;e to mili|tary force and corruption. A &s;y&s;tem of terror and coercion can alone keep down the people, and compel a tame acquie&s;cence under u&s;urped power, abu&s;ed for the purpo&s;es of oppre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P><HI>Standing armies</HI> are therefore the glory and delight of all who are actuated by the &s;pirit of de&s;poti&s;m. They would have no great objec|tion to military government and martial law,
<PB N="322" REF="028936_0330_0FDD7797A89298C0">while power is in their own hands, or in the hands of their patrons. The implicit &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ion of an army, the doctrine, which the mili|tary &s;y&s;tem favors, that men in &s;ubaltern &s;tations are to act as they are bidden, and never to deliberate on the propriety of the command, is perfectly congenial with the &s;pirit of de&s;poti&s;m. The glitter, the pomp, the parade and o&s;ten|tation of war are al&s;o highly plea&s;ing to minds that prefer &s;plendor and pageantry to &s;olid and &s;ub&s;tantial comfort. The happine&s;s, which mu&s;t ever depend on the tranquility of the people, is little regarded, when &s;et in compe|tition with the gratification of per&s;onal vanity. Plumes, lace, &s;hining arms, and other habili|ments of war, &s;et off the <HI>per&s;on</HI> to great advan|tage; and as to the wretches who are &s;lain or wounded, plunged into captivity and di&s;ea&s;e, in order to &s;upport this finery, are they not <HI>paid</HI> for it? Be&s;ides, they are, for the mo&s;t part, in the lowe&s;t cla&s;s, and tho&s;e whom <HI>nobody</HI> knows.</P>
<P>Such is the love of &s;tanding armies, in &s;ome countries, that attempts are made to render even the national militia little different from a &s;tanding army. This circum&s;tance alone is a &s;ymptom of the &s;pirit of de&s;poti&s;m. A militia of <HI>mercenary</HI> &s;ub&s;titutes, under officers entirely devoted to a mini&s;ter, mu&s;t add greatly to a &s;tanding army, from which, in fact, it would differ only in name. Should the <HI>people</HI> be entirely <HI>di&s;armed,</HI> and &s;carcely a mu&s;ket and bayonet in the country but under the manage|ment
<PB N="323" REF="028936_0331_0FDD779CE6F2B018">of a mini&s;ter, through the agency of &s;er|vile lords lieutenant and venal magi&s;trates, what defence would remain, in extremeties, either for the king or the people?</P>
<P>The love of pomp and finery, though ridi|culous in it&s;elf, may thus become injurious to liberty, and therefore to happine&s;s, by increa&s;|ing the <HI>military order</HI> in the time of <HI>peace,</HI> and when mini&s;terial arts have contributed to render that order devoted to purpo&s;es of &s;elfi&s;h aggran|dizement or borough influence. Minds, capa|ble of being captivated with the &s;illy parade of war, are of too &s;oft a texture to gra&s;p the manly principles of true patrioti&s;m. They will u&s;ually prefer the favor of a court, which has many <HI>&s;hining</HI> ornaments to be&s;tow, to the e&s;teem of the people. A heart deeply infected with the &s;pirit of de&s;poti&s;m, de&s;pi&s;es the people too much to be in the lea&s;t &s;olicitous to obtain popular applau&s;e. Prai&s;e is but breath; and often, like the wind, veers about incon&s;tantly; and certainly will de&s;ert a man, who has de&s;erted the virtuous and benevolent conduct which fir&s;t excited it. But ribands, &s;tars, garters, places, pen&s;ions, u&s;ually la&s;t for life; and titles de&s;cend to the late&s;t po&s;terity. Honor, once gained by royal &s;miles, is a part of the family goods and chattels, and goes down, from generation to generation, without requiring to the day of doom, any painful exertion, any meritorious &s;ervices, but leaving its happy po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors to the free enjoyment of idlene&s;s and luxury. No wonder, therefore, that where the &s;elfi&s;h &s;pirit
<PB N="324" REF="028936_0332_0FDD779EE83D8380">of de&s;poti&s;m prevails, a bauble be&s;towed by a court &s;hall outweigh a whole people's plaudits. A coat of arms makes a figure on the e&s;cutcheon and the tomb&s;tone; but not a &s;crap of gilded and painted &s;ilk&mdash;not even a <HI>bloody hand,</HI> can be be&s;towed by the mo&s;t cordial e&s;teem of the low multitude.</P>
<P>Heraldry <HI>it&s;elf,</HI> though a childi&s;h, is a harm|le&s;s vanity; but, but, as conducing very much to the &s;pirit of de&s;poti&s;m, it becomes not only ridiculous, but mi&s;chievous. It makes a di&s;|tinction, on which men plume them&s;elves, without merit and without &s;ervices. Sati&s;|fied with &s;uch a di&s;tinction, they will be le&s;s inclined to acquire merit and to render &s;ervices. They can inherit a coat of arms; or they can buy one; or, which is more compendious &s;till, they can borrow or invent one. It is enough that they are &s;eparated from the <HI>canaille.</HI> The coach, the hall, the church, is crouded with their <HI>atchievements;</HI> there is no occa&s;ion for arduous exertion. They are now rai&s;ed above the vulgar. The work is done. Their name is up; they may &s;lumber in the repo&s;e of u&s;e|le&s;s in&s;ignificance, or move in the re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s of mi&s;chievous activity. The coat of arms is at once a &s;hield for folly, and a banner in the triumph of pride.</P>
<P>But both pride and folly &s;hould be permitted for me to enjoy their baubles unmole&s;ted, if they did not lead to CRUELTY. But pride and folly are the cau&s;es of war; therefore I hate them from my &s;oul. They <HI>glory</HI> in de&s;truction;
<PB N="325" REF="028936_0333_0FDD77A0315201D0">and among the mo&s;t frequent ornaments, even of our churches, (the very hou&s;es of peace,) are hung up on high <HI>trophies</HI> of war. Dead men (them&s;elves &s;ubdued by the univer&s;al con|queror) are repre&s;ented, by their &s;urviving friends, as rejoicing, even in their graves, in the implements of man-&s;laughter. Helmets, &s;words, and blood-&s;tained flags hang over the grave, together with the e&s;cutcheons and mar|ble monuments, emblematical of human fero|city; of tho&s;e actions and pa&s;&s;ions which Chri&s;|tianity repudiates; for as well might oil and vinegar coale&s;ce, as War and Chri&s;tianity.</P>
<P>Spirit of De&s;poti&s;m! I would laugh at all thy extravagances, thy &s;olemn mummery, thy baby baubles, thy airs of in&s;olence, thy finery and frippery, thy impotent in&s;ults over virtue, genius, and all per&s;onal merit, thy &s;trutting, &s;elf-plea&s;ing mien and language! I would con|&s;ider them all with the eye of a Democritus, as affording a con&s;tant farce, an inexhau&s;tible fund of merriment, did they not lead to the malevolent pa&s;&s;ions, which, in their effects, forge chains for men born free, plunder the poor of their property, and &s;hed the blood of innocence.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION XLI. CONCLUSION.</HEAD>
<P>TO meliorate the condition of human nature, can be the only rational end of govern|ment. It cannot be de&s;igned to favor one de&s;cription of men, a MINORITY of men, at the expence of all others; who, having received life from him who alone can give it, received at the &s;ame time a right to enjoy it in liberty and &s;ecurity. This was the charter of God and nature; which no mortal, however elevated by conque&s;t or inheritance, can annul or vio|late without impiety. All government which makes not the advancement of human happine&s;s, and the comfort of the individuals who are &s;ubject to its control, the <HI>prime</HI> purpo&s;e of its operations, partakes of de&s;poti&s;m: and I have always thought that, in governments which boa&s;t of a free con&s;titution, the views, even of &s;tate&s;men and politicians who e&s;pou&s;ed the cau&s;e of liberty, have been too circum&s;cribed. They have been attached to names and families. They &s;eem not to have opened either their eyes or hearts to objects truly great, and affections &s;incerely catholic and philanthropic. I hate to hear public men, who certainly can have no right to their pre-eminence but for the public good, profe&s;&s;ing them&s;elves of the Rockingham Party, the Shelburne Party, the Portland Party,
<PB N="327" REF="028936_0335_0FDD77A592EF61B0">and appearing to forget, in their zeal for a few di&s;tingui&s;hed hou&s;es, the great ma&s;s of the People, the PARTY of human nature. The majority of men are poor and ob&s;cure. To them all party attachments to names and fami|lies, little known as public benefactors, mu&s;t appear at once ab&s;urd and injurious. They are the per&s;ons who &s;tand in mo&s;t need of pro|tection and a&s;&s;i&s;tance from the powerful. The rich, under all governments, have a thou&s;and means of procuring either comfort or defence. It is the ma&s;s, the poor and middling ranks, unknown to, and unknowing courts or kings, who require all the alleviation which men en|lightened by knowledge, furni&s;hed with opu|lence, elevated by rank, can afford to le&s;&s;en the natural evils of life, aggravated by the moral and artificial. Government po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the power of alleviating, and &s;ometimes of removing, that moral and phy&s;ical evil which embitters exi&s;tence. How deplorable, when government becomes &s;o perverted, as to increa&s;e the evil it was de&s;igned to cure. Yet this has been, and is now the ca&s;e on a great part of the globe; in&s;omuch that the learned and judi|cious Dr. Prideaux, who&s;e integrity is as well known as his ability, u&s;ed to &s;ay, "That it was a doubt with him, whether the benefit which the world receives from government, was &s;ufficient to make amends for the calami|ties which it &s;uffers from the follies, mi&s;takes, and mal-admini&s;tration of tho&s;e who manage it."</P>
<P><PB N="328" REF="028936_0336_0FDD77A6AD7E0EA0">
When it is con&s;idered how little the mo&s;t boa&s;ted governments have been able or incli|ned to prevent the greate&s;t calamity of the world, the frequent recurrence of WAR, it is natural to conclude, that there has been &s;ome radical defect or error in all government, hi|therto in&s;tituted on the face of the earth. <HI>Vio|lence</HI> may be u&s;ed where there is <HI>no</HI> government. Governments pretend to direct human affairs by <HI>rea&s;on;</HI> but war is a dereliction of rea&s;on, a renunciation of all that refines and improves human nature, and an appeal to brute force. Man de&s;cends from the heights to which philo|&s;ophers and legi&s;lators had rai&s;ed him in &s;ociety; takes the &s;word, and &s;urpa&s;&s;es the bea&s;ts of the fore&s;t in ferocity. Yet, &s;o far from thinking him&s;elf culpable, he deems his de&s;tructive em|ployment the mo&s;t honorable of all human occupations, becau&s;e governments have politi|cally contrived to throw a glo&s;&s;y mantle, covered with tin&s;el and &s;pangles, over the hor|rors of blood&s;hed and deva&s;tation. If go|vernments, with all their riches and power, all their vaunted arts and &s;ciences, all the my&s;te|erious policy of cabinets, all the wi&s;dom and eloquence of deliberating &s;enates, are <HI>unable</HI> to pre&s;erve the <HI>ble&s;&s;ing of peace,</HI> uninterrupted, du|ring the &s;hort &s;pace of twenty years together, they mu&s;t be dreadfully faulty, either in their con&s;titution or their admini&s;tration. In what con&s;i&s;ts the fault? I think in the &s;elfi&s;h &s;pirit of de&s;poti&s;m, pur&s;uing the &s;ordid or vain-glorious purpo&s;es of the governors, with little regard to
<PB N="329" REF="028936_0337_0FDD77A831656A90">the real, &s;ub&s;tantial happine&s;s of the governed. De&s;poti&s;m, in &s;ome mode or degree, has tran&s;|formed the &s;hepherds of the flock into wolves; has appropriated the fleeces, &s;hed the blood of the innoxious animals, tore down the fences of the &s;heepfold, and laid wa&s;te the pa&s;ture.</P>
<P>Where is the government that has di&s;tribu|ted property &s;o equitably, as that none to whom exi&s;tence has been given &s;hould want the <HI>nece&s;&s;aries</HI> of exi&s;tence; and where helple&s;s age and infirmity, as well as helple&s;s infancy, &s;hould find a pillow to repo&s;e on, and plenty to nouri&s;h it, without &s;upplicating a MAN, <HI>equal</HI> by nature, for the cold &s;canty relief of eleemo|&s;ynary charity? The truth is, power gradually <HI>engro&s;&s;es</HI> property; and the &s;elfi&s;h &s;pirit of de&s;|poti&s;m is ever &s;triving to appropriate all the good, of every kind, which the earth is able to produce.</P>
<P>The truth is, <HI>national glory,</HI> the trappings of a court, the parade of armies, the finery of external appearance, have been the &s;illy objects of <HI>&s;tate</HI> &s;olicitude; while MAN was left to bewail, in the rece&s;&s;es of want and ob&s;cu|rity, that his mother had brought him into a world of woe, without means of comfort or &s;upport, with little other pro&s;pect than to labor without cea&s;ing, to fight tho&s;e who never injured him, and to die prematurely, un|known, and unlamented. All his wretched|ne&s;s has been aggravated by the <HI>in&s;ults</HI> of unfeeling pride; the <HI>neglect</HI> of ari&s;tocratic gran|deur, which, under the &s;pirit of de&s;poti&s;m,
<PB N="330" REF="028936_0338_0FDD77AEFA49F388">mocked by the fal&s;e pageantry of life, tho&s;e who were doomed to feel its real mi&s;ery. The vain pomp and glory of the world, held out the finger of &s;corn to that wretchedne&s;s which it&s;elf contributed to create, and would not relieve.</P>
<P><HI>Three &s;core years and ten,</HI> and tho&s;e often full of labor and &s;orrow, con&s;titute the &s;pace allotted to the life of man in a venerable volume, full of beauty as well as in&s;truction, and worthy of great attention independently of the high authority attributed to it by the reli|gion e&s;tabli&s;hed by the laws of this country. Few and evil are our days, even when they proceed to their natural extent, and are attended with the common portion of health and pro&s;pe|rity. Yet, as if a <HI>&s;uper<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">uity</HI> of years and happine&s;s were lavi&s;hed on men, the chief bu&s;i|ne&s;s of the greate&s;t part of governments on the whole earth has been to abbreviate life, to poi|&s;on and embitter its &s;weete&s;t plea&s;ures, and add new pungency to its angui&s;h. Yet &s;ee the fal&s;e <HI>glitter</HI> of happine&s;s, the pomp and parade which &s;uch governments a&s;&s;ume; ob&s;erve the gravity and in&s;olence of &s;uperiority which their mini&s;ters, their &s;tate&s;men, and their war|riors, a&s;&s;ume, and you would imagine them a commi&s;&s;ioned regency, lord li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">utenants &s;ent by Heaven to rule this lower world, and to rectify all di&s;orders which had e&s;caped the vigilance of the Deity. The time has been when they have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ctually claimed the title of God's vicegerents, and have been literally wor&s;hipped as gods by
<PB N="331" REF="028936_0339_0FDD77AF03CD28E8">the &s;ervile crew of courtiers; men gradually bowed down by de&s;poti&s;m from the erect port of native dignity, and driven by fear to crouch under the mo&s;t degrading of all &s;uper&s;tition, the political idolatry of a ba&s;e fellow-creature.</P>
<P>After all the language of court adulation, the prai&s;es of poets and orators, the &s;tatues and monuments erected to their fame, the malignant con&s;equences of their actions prove them to have been no other than con&s;pirators again&s;t the improvement and happine&s;s of the human race. What were their means of con|ducting their governments, of exerci&s;ing this office of Heaven's vicegerents? Crafty, di&s;|hone&s;t arts, oppre&s;&s;ion, extortion, and above all FIRE and SWORD. They dared to ape the thunder and lightning of Heaven, and, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the machinations of the Grand Adver&s;ary of man, rendered their imitative contrivances for de&s;truction more terrible and deadly than the original. Their imperial robe derived its deep crim&s;on color from human blood; and the gold and diamonds of their diadems were accumulated trea&s;ures wrung from the fami&s;hed bowels of the <HI>poor,</HI> born only to toil for others, to be robbed, to be wounded, to be trodden under foot and forgotten in an early grave. How few, in compari&s;on, have reached the age of three &s;core and ten, and yet, in the mid&s;t of youth and health, their days have been full of labor and &s;orrow. Heaven's vicege|rents &s;eldom be&s;towed a thought upon them, except when it was nece&s;&s;ary either to inveigle
<PB N="332" REF="028936_0340_0FDD77B05E5CDF78">or to force them to take the &s;word and march to &s;laughter. Where God cau&s;ed the &s;un to &s;hine gaily, and &s;eattered plenty over the land, his vicegerents diffu&s;ed famine and &s;olitude. The valley which laughed with &s;corn, they watered with the tear of artificial hunger and di&s;tre&s;s, the plain that was bright with verdure, and gay with flowrets, they dyed red with gore. They operated on the world as the bla&s;t of an ea&s;t wind, as a pe&s;tilence, as a deluge, as a con|flagration. And have they yet cea&s;ed from the earth? Ca&s;t your eyes over the plains of Ru&s;&s;ia, Poland, a great part of Europe, the wilds of Africa, and the gardens of A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">IA, European de&s;poti&s;m has united with oriental, to unparadi&s;e the provinces of India.</P>
<P>Thus, if God, in his wi&s;dom, has thought fit to allot us a <HI>few evils</HI> for the purpo&s;e of di&s;cipline, the OREAT ONES of the world have endeavored to make the <HI>whole</HI> of lire an evil to the de&s;pi&s;ed and neglected MILLION. The world is now old, and may profit by the le&s;&s;ons of Experience. SHE has deci&s;ively declared, that de&s;poti&s;m is the grand &s;ource of human misfortune, the Pandora's box out of which every cur&s;e has i&s;&s;ued, and &s;carcely left even Hope behind. De&s;poti&s;m, in its extreme, is &s;atal to human happine&s;s, and, in all its degrees and modifications, injurious. The &s;pirit of it ought therefore to be &s;uppre&s;&s;ed on the fir&s;t and &s;lighte&s;t appearance. It &s;hould be the endeavor of every good man, <HI>pro virili,</HI> as &s;ar as his be&s;t abilities will extend, to extirpate all
<PB N="333" REF="028936_0341_0FDD77B1EBFA7BE0">arbitrary government from the globe. It &s;hould be &s;wept from the earth, or trampled under foot, from China to Peru. But no power is capable of cru&s;hing the Hydra, le&s;s than the Herculean arm of a whole PEOPLE.</P>
<P>I lay it down as an incontrovertible axiom, that all who are born into the world have a right to be happy in it as the unavoidable evils of nature, and their own di&s;ordered pa&s;&s;ions, will allow. The grand object of all good go|vernment, of all government that is not an u&s;urpation, mu&s;t be to promote this happine&s;s, to a&s;&s;i&s;t every individual in its attainment and &s;ecurity. A government chiefly anxious about the emoluments of office, chiefly employed in augmenting its own power and aggrandizing its ob&s;equious in&s;truments, while it neglects the comfort and &s;afety of individuals in middle or low life, is de&s;potic and a nui&s;ance. It is founded on folly as well as wickedne&s;s, and, like the freaks of in&s;anity, deals mi&s;chief and mi&s;ery around, without being able to a&s;certain or limit its extent and duration. If it &s;hould not be puni&s;hed as criminal, let it be coerced as dangerous. Let the &s;traight wai&s;tcoat be applied; but let MEN, judging fellow men, <HI>always</HI> &s;pare the axe.</P>
<P>For what <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ational purpo&s;e could we enter into life? To vex, torment, and flay each other with the &s;word? To be and to make mi&s;erable? No, by the &s;weet mercy of Heaven! I firmly believe, that the great King of Kings, intended every &s;on and daughter of Adam to
<PB N="334" REF="028936_0342_0FDD77B768030AC0">be as happy as the eternal laws of Nature, un|der his control, permit them to be in this &s;ub|lunary &s;tate. Execrated and exploded be all tho&s;e politics, with Machiavel, or the Evil Be|ing, their author, which introduce &s;y&s;tems of government and manners among the great, incon&s;i&s;tent with the happine&s;s of the majority. Mu&s;t real tragedies be forever acting on the &s;tage of human life? Mu&s;t men go on forever to be tormentors and executioners of men? Is the world never to profit by the experience of ages? Mu&s;t not even <HI>attempts</HI> be made to improve the happine&s;s of life, to improve go|vernment, though all arts and &s;ciences are en|couraged in their progre&s;s to perfection? Mu&s;t the grand art, the &s;ublime&s;t &s;cience, that of meliorating the condition of human nature, be &s;tationary? No; forbid it rea&s;on, virtue, bene|volence, religion! Let the world be made more and more comfortable, to all who are allowed the glorious privilege of &s;eeing the &s;un and breathing the liberal air. Our forefathers were duped by prie&s;ts and de&s;pots, and, through the timidity of &s;uper&s;tition and the blindne&s;s of ignorance, &s;ubmitted to be made artificially mi&s;erable. Let us explode that folly which we <HI>&s;ee;</HI> and let every mortal under the cope of heaven enjoy exi&s;tence, as long as nature will allow the fea&s;t to continue, without any re|&s;traints on liberty but &s;uch as the majority of uncorrupted gue&s;ts unite in agreeing to be &s;alu|tary, and therefore conducive to the general fe&s;tivity. Men are too <HI>&s;erious</HI> in pur&s;uing
<PB N="335" REF="028936_0343_0FDD77B8A3287918">toys, money, titles, &s;tars, ribands, triumphs, any thing that gives a momentary di&s;tinction, and gratifies an unmanly pride. They have embraced a cloud for a godde&s;s. Let them di&s;pel the mi&s;t, rai&s;ed by fal&s;e policy and cruel de&s;poti&s;m. Let them at la&s;t di&s;tingui&s;h real good, from its delu&s;ive appearance. Let them value duly, and pur&s;ue diligently, &s;olid com|fort, health, cheerfulne&s;s, contentment, uni|ver&s;al benevolence, and learn to reli&s;h the &s;weets of nature and &s;implicity. They will then &s;ee happine&s;s in &s;omething be&s;ides the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>gold;</HI> be&s;ides tho&s;e <HI>external</HI> marks of &s;uperiority which rai&s;e them to notice, and di&s;tingui&s;h them from their equals without a difference. Strife and wars will cea&s;e, when men perceive that their highe&s;t happine&s;s is mo&s;t ea&s;ily attainable in a &s;tate of contented tranquillity; their guide, nature, and their guard, innocence.</P>
<P>The principal objects of all rational go|vernment, &s;uch as is intended to promote human happine&s;s, are two; to pre&s;erve <HI>peace,</HI> and to diffu&s;e <HI>plenty.</HI> Such government will &s;eldom tax the nece&s;&s;aries of life. It will avoid WARS; and, by &s;uch humane and wi&s;e policy, render taxes on <HI>nece&s;&s;aries</HI> totally &s;uperfluous. Taxes on <HI>nece&s;&s;aries</HI> are u&s;ually cau&s;ed by war. The poor, however, are not ea&s;ily excited to in&s;urrection. It is a ba&s;e calumny which accu|&s;es them. They are naturally quie&s;cent; in|clined to &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion by their habits, and wil|ling to reverence all their &s;uperiors who behave
<PB N="336" REF="028936_0344_0FDD77BA1AA5DE70">to them ju&s;tly and kindly. They de&s;erve to be u&s;ed well. They de&s;erve confidence. But oppre&s;&s;ion and per&s;ecution may teach them to lift their gigantic arm, and then vain will be re&s;i&s;tance. Let not wars then be wantonly undertaken, which be&s;ides their inju&s;tice and inhumanity, tend more than any thing el&s;e, by increa&s;ing taxes, to compel in&s;urrection. The poor man hears great prai&s;es be&s;towed on the government he lives under, and perpetual panegyrics on the con&s;titution. He knows little of general politics. He judges from the <HI>effects</HI> he FEELS. He knows that malt,
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I heard a great borough-monger of eleven or twelve thou&s;and a-year a&s;&s;ert, while he held a gla&s;s of Madeira in his hand to wa&s;h down a plentiful dinner, that <HI>malt</HI> could not be reckoned among the <HI>nece&s;&s;aries</HI> of the poor laborer, becau&s;e he might drink <HI>water,</HI> which is very <HI>whole&s;ome.</HI></NOTE> lea|ther, candles, &s;oap, &s;alt, and windows, with|out which he cannot exi&s;t in comfort, are &s;o heavily t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ed as &s;ometimes to exclude him from obtaining the &s;canty portion he would require. In return for the defalcations from malt, leather, candles, &s;oap, &s;alt, and win|dows; he &s;ees pen&s;ions, places, rich contract|ors, di&s;graceful, ruinous, and bloody wars. Yet he ri&s;es up early, and goeth forth to his work and his labor, with cheerfulne&s;s. Is he not a worthy, re&s;pectable member of &s;ociety, and de&s;erving of every indulgence? Ought he to be in&s;ulted by approbrious appellations, con|&s;idered as of no political con&s;equence, as po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ing no rights, and little removed from the
<PB N="337" REF="028936_0345_0FDD77C0307FF460">cattle? Suppo&s;e millions of &s;uch men in a country, ought not their wi&s;hes to be con&s;ulted, and a regard for their comfort and &s;ecurity to &s;top the &s;word, while emerging from its &s;cab|bard at the command of a MINISTER?</P>
<P>Great reforms u&s;ually come from the people. They are &s;low to anger, and &s;ubmit in patience. But grievances may become intolerable; and then their energy di&s;plays it&s;elf like a torrent, that has long lain &s;till and placid within the dam, which oppo&s;ed its cour&s;e to a certain point, but could re&s;i&s;t no longer.</P>
<P>If ever any people &s;hould be rou&s;ed to take their own affairs into their own hands, I hope they will refute the calumnies of the proud, by acting with ju&s;tice and mercy. All human creatures are weak and fallible; kings and mini|&s;ters have exhibited remarkable in&s;tances of this common imbecility. Great allowances &s;hould therefore be made for their errors and even <HI>crimes,</HI> which, probably, originated in error. I wi&s;h to &s;ee the Briti&s;h government made as perfect as human ingenuity and virtue can render it; but I would effect reform in it, without injuring the per&s;on or de&s;troying the life of the mo&s;t obnox|ious individual. I would pardon much to hu|man infirmity. Not one drop of blood &s;hould be &s;hed, nor a &s;ingle mite of property violated. No inju&s;tice whatever &s;hould di&s;grace the wi&s;|dom of the people. Compen&s;ations &s;hould be made by the public to all individuals, of all parties and per&s;ua&s;ions, when compelled to relinqui&s;h po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions or privileges lawfully in|herited,
<PB N="338" REF="028936_0346_0FDD77C263511F58">or hone&s;tly acquired. The mo&s;t liberal, expanded genero&s;ity &s;hould vindicate the honor of human nature, too long in&s;ulted. Mini&s;ters and grandees, who form the ari&s;tocracy, either of opulence or nobility, however tyrannical and in&s;olent in the day of their pro&s;perity, &s;hould live out the little &s;pace allotted to man, in a &s;tate of ea&s;e and affluence adapted to their habits and education. I would &s;hew them how truly noble and glorious it is to forgive. And they could not be formidable again&s;t an united people. For how weak, how tran&s;itory is man? Death, <HI>natural,</HI> unprecipitated death, will &s;oon tame the haughtie&s;t &s;pirit that ever &s;welled the fan|cied importance of a crown; and the infirmi|ties attending the approach of death, the gra|dual decays of age, will u&s;ually teach a le&s;&s;on of unfeigned humility.</P>
<P>The people, at pre&s;ent, appear to be &s;unk in a political lethargy. But let not mini&s;ters confide too much in the &s;ymptoms. A calm precedes a &s;torm. Long continued abu&s;es, heavy burdens, and &s;evere grievances, without a dream of hope, may awaken the lion. Then, I think, tho&s;e who have &s;hewn an inclination to &s;et up a power unknown to con&s;titutional freedom, and to render government ho&s;tile to the people, may ju&s;tly fear.</P>
<P>And who, it may be a&s;ked, are they? I am happy in the opportunity of declaring it my opinion, that the KING is not among them. They are men to whom neither the King nor the people are dear. They are, in a word,
<PB N="339" REF="028936_0347_0FDD77C43481FC70">the <HI>oligarchy of borough-mongers,</HI> who&s;e power is founded on an u&s;urpation; and who&s;e a&s;&s;umed SOVEREIGNTY is no le&s;s incon&s;i&s;tent with the real freedom of a king than of a people. A mo&s;t re&s;pectable &s;ociety, not long ago, a&s;&s;erted in a petition to the Hou&s;e of Commons, and offered to prove it at the bar, that <HI>one hun|dred and fifty-four men</HI> nominate and appoint a majority of the Hou&s;e. Has it not been &s;u&s;pected, that a WAR might have been made and &s;upported, to preve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t the annihilation of this oligarchy; by turning the attention of the people from a reform of parliament, and en|deavoring to give a deadly &s;tab to liberty. If the &s;u&s;picion be well founded, this very cir|cum&s;tance is the &s;tronge&s;t argument for reform which has ever been produced. Oceans of <HI>blood,</HI> and <HI>trea&s;ure</HI> enough to relieve all the poor in the nation for many years, lavi&s;hed to e&s;tabli&s;h a de&s;poti&s;m, inimical to the King, the people, and to human nature! We have now reached the &s;ource of the evil, a &s;ource not &s;o concealed as the fountain of the Nile. It is the corruption of boroughs, and the interference of mini&s;ters, peers, placemen, pen&s;ioners, and expectants, in parliamentary elections, which cau&s;es the <HI>&s;pirit of de&s;poti&s;m</HI> to increa&s;e; for nature, rea&s;on, and &s;elf-intere&s;t too, if they were not counteracted by corrupt influence, would revolt at it. The egg would be in&s;tantly cru&s;hed, if it were not con&s;tantly guarded and fo&s;tered in the warm, well-fortified ne&s;t of
<PB N="340" REF="028936_0348_0FDD77CA459707C0"><HI>borough-influence,</HI> directing all mea&s;ures and di&s;po&s;ing of all patronage.</P>
<P>But they are all <HI>honorable</HI> men, who are concerned in this influence. They may no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> be morally wor&s;e or better than others in their &s;ituation. Their &s;ituation renders them poli|tically iniquitous. The world is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> by men, and men by their pa&s;&s;ions, and their &s;uppo&s;ed intere&s;t. But it is the bu&s;ine&s;s of laws to re&s;train them. The people are bound to watch the conduct of all who&s;e conduct is iufluential on their welfare. Unlimited con|fidence &s;hould be given to no man, when the happine&s;s of millions is concerned in the con&s;e|quences of his actions or coun&s;els.</P>
<P>"The common people," &s;ays a &s;en&s;ible author, "generally think that <HI>great</HI> men have <HI>great</HI> minds, and &s;corn <HI>ba&s;e</HI> actions; which judgment is &s;o fal&s;e, that the ba&s;e&s;t and wor&s;t of all actions have been done by <HI>great men.</HI> They have often di&s;turbed, deceived and pil|laged the world; and he who is capable of the <HI>highe&s;t</HI> mi&s;chief is capable of the MEANEST. He who plunders a country of a million of money would, in &s;uitable circum&s;tances, &s;teal a &s;ilver &s;poon; and a conqueror, who &s;tands and pillages a kingdom, would, in an humbler &s;ituation, rifle a portmanteau." I &s;hould not, therefore, choo&s;e to expo&s;e my watch or pur&s;e in a crowd, to tho&s;e men who have plundered Poland, if, in&s;tead of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing a crown of jewels, and the pocket of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive nations, they had been in
<PB N="341" REF="028936_0349_0FDD77CC25D6D420">the circum&s;tances of a <HI>Barrington.</HI> Nor, though men &s;hould be called <HI>honorable,</HI> will it be &s;afe to tru&s;t our liberties to their honor, without &s;ome collateral &s;ecurity; e&s;pecially when we &s;ee them interfering with and control|ling elections, contrary to expre&s;s laws, and contrary not only to the dictates of <HI>honor,</HI> but of common hone&s;ty. They <HI>u&s;urp</HI> a power for the gratification of pride and avarice, which they cannot hold but to the injury of the law|ful and right owners. How differs this in a moral view, from robbery? It differs, in a political view indeed, ina&s;much as it is infi|nitely more injurious to &s;ociety.</P>
<P>The oppo&s;ers of reform, the invaders of the people's rights, are no le&s;s blind and &s;hort|&s;ighted than meanly &s;elfi&s;h. Let them pour their venom on the people, and di&s;pute popu|lar claims to natural right, as much as they plea&s;e; the people mu&s;t at la&s;t triumph, and liberty will in time flouri&s;h all over Europe. Court para&s;ites, and &s;elfi&s;h grandees, will do right to u&s;e a little fore&s;ight; to con&s;ider what <HI>revolutions</HI> may be, by viewing what have been; and not to exa&s;perate mankind too much, le&s;t the irritation &s;hould produce, what God avert, &s;anguinary vengeance.</P>
<P>I take my leave on this occa&s;ion, recom|mending, from the bottom of my heart, to men in power, mea&s;ures of CONCILIATION. Let them come among us with <HI>healing</HI> in their wings. Let them concede with cheerfulne&s;s, whatever cannot be denied without inju&s;tice.
<PB N="342" REF="028936_0350_0FDD77D27537CF50">Let them &s;hew them&s;elves real friends to liberty and man. The Engli&s;h nation is remarkable for genero&s;ity and good-nature.
