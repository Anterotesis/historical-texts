The Author's Friend&s;hip &s;ent the Manu&s;cript cro&s;s the <HI>Atlantick</HI> to my Hands; and having read it, I thought it would be criminal to conceal &s;uch generous Principles, and powerful Motives to his Maje&s;ty's Service, from the Publick, either in <HI>England</HI> or <HI>America.</HI></P>

<Q><BIBL><HI>JER. XLVIII. 10.</HI></BIBL>
<P>Cur&s;ed be he that doth the Work of the Lord deceitfully; and cur&s;ed be he that keepeth back his Sword from Blood.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>NOTHING can be more agreeable to the God of Peace, than to &s;ee univer&s;al Harmony and Bene|volence prevail among his Creatures; and He has laid them under the &s;tronge&s;t Obligations to cultivate a pacific Temper towards one another, both as Individuals, and as Nations. <HI>Follow Peace with all Men,</HI> is one of the principal Precepts of our holy Religion. And the great Prince of Peace has &s;olemnly pronounced, <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed are the Peace-makers.</HI></P>
<P>But when, in this corrupt di&s;ordered State of Things, where the Lu&s;ts of Men are perpetually embroiling the World with Wars and Fightings, and throwing all into Confu&s;ion; when Ambition and Avarice would rob us of our Property, for which we have toiled, and on which we &s;ub&s;i&s;t; when they would en&s;lave the free-born Mind, and compel us meanly to cringe to U&s;urpation and arbitrary Power; when they would tear from our eager Gra&s;p the mo&s;t valuable Ble&s;&s;ing of Heaven, I mean our RELIGION; when they invade our Country, formerly the Region of Tranquillity, ravage our Frontiers, butcher our Fellow-Subjects, or confine them in a barbarous Captivity in the Dens of Savages; when our <HI>earthly</HI> All is ready to be &s;eized by rapacious Hands, and even our <HI>Eternal</HI> All is in Danger by the Lo&s;s of our Religion: when this is the Ca&s;e, what is then the Will of God? Mu&s;t Peace then be main|tained? maintained with our perfidious and cruel Invaders?
<PB N="2" REF="008333_0006_102F326EDC8204F8">maintained at the Expence of Property, Liberty, Life, and every Thing dear and valuable? maintained, when it is in our Power to vindicate our Right, and do our&s;elves Ju&s;tice? Is the Work of Peace then our only Bu&s;ine&s;s? No; in &s;uch a Time even the God of Peace proclaims by his Providence, TO ARMS! Then the <HI>Sword</HI> is, as it were, <HI>con&s;ecrated</HI> to God; and the Art of WAR becomes a Part of our Religion. Then happy is he that &s;hall reward our Enemies as they have &s;erved us.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>P&s;al</HI> cxxxvii. 8.</NOTE> Ble&s;&s;ed is the brave Soldier; ble&s;&s;ed is the Defender of his Country, and the De&s;troyer of its Enemies. Ble&s;&s;ed are they who offer them&s;elves willingly in this Service, and who faithfully di&s;charge it. But on the other Hand, <HI>Cur&s;ed is he that doth the Work of the Lord deceitfully; and cur&s;ed is he that keepeth back his Sword from Blood.</HI></P>
<P>As to the original Reference and Meaning of the&s;e Words, it is &s;ufficient to my Purpo&s;e to ob&s;erve, That the <HI>Moabites,</HI> again&s;t whom this Prophecy was immediately denounced, were a trouble&s;ome and re&s;tle&s;s Nation in the Neighbourhood of the <HI>Jews,</HI> who, tho' often &s;ubdued by them, as <HI>France</HI> has been by <HI>England,</HI> yet upon every Oc|ca&s;ion &s;truggled to recover their Power, and renewed their Ho&s;tilities. By this, and various other Steps, they were arrived to the highe&s;t Pitch of national Guilt, and ripe for Execution. The <HI>Babylonians</HI> were commi&s;&s;ioned for this Work of Vengeance; and they were bound to execute the Commi&s;&s;ion faithfully, under the Penalty of a Cur&s;e. To them this Denunciation was immediately directed, <HI>Cur&s;ed be he that doth the Work of the Lord deceitfully,</HI> or negli|gently; <HI>and cur&s;ed be he that keepeth back his Sword from Blood.</HI> This is expre&s;&s;ed in the Form of an Imprecation, or an authoritative Denunciation of a Cur&s;e: And in this Form it might be u&s;ed, con&s;i&s;tently with Benevolence, by a Prophet &s;peaking as the Mouth of God. But this is not a Pattern for our Imitation, who are peculiarly obliged under the Go&s;pel, to <HI>Ble&s;s, and cur&s;e not,</HI> and to <HI>pray for all Men.</HI> However, it may be pronounced even by our Lips as a Declaration of the righteous Cur&s;e of God again&s;t a da|&s;tardly Refu&s;al to engage in War, when it is our Duty; or
<PB N="3" REF="008333_0007_102F3272D973CAF8">a deceitful negligent Di&s;charge of that Duty, after we have engaged in it. The&s;e are the Crimes that &s;eem intended in my Text; and again&s;t each of the&s;e the tremendous Cur&s;e of JEHOVAH is &s;till in full Force in all Ages, even under the mild and gentle Di&s;pen&s;ation or the Go&s;pel. Cowardice and Treachery are now as execrable as ever.</P>
<P><HI>Cur&s;ed be he that keepeth back his Sword from Blood. &mdash;</HI> This Denunciation, like the Artillery of Heaven, is leveled again&s;t the mean, &s;neaking Coward, who, when God, in the Cour&s;e of his Providence, calls him to Arms, refu&s;es to obey, and con&s;ults his own Ea&s;e and Safety, more than his Duty to God and his Country.</P>
<P><HI>Cur&s;ed be he that doth the Work of the Lord deceitfully.</HI>&mdash; This &s;eems to be leveled again&s;t another Species of Cowards; &s;ly, hypocritical Cowards, who undertake the Work of the Lord, that is, take up Arms; but they do the Work of the Lord <HI>deceitfully,</HI> that is, they do not faithfully u&s;e their Arms for the Purpo&s;es they were taken up. They com|mence Soldiers, not that they may &s;erve their Country, and do their Duty to God, but that they may live in Ea&s;e, Idlene&s;s and Plea&s;ure, and enrich them&s;elves at the public Expence. <HI>Cur&s;ed is he that doth the Work of the Lord deceitfully.</HI> and &s;erves him&s;elf under Pretence of &s;erving his Country.</P>
<P>You, Gentlemen and others, whom I this Day behold with peculiar Plea&s;ure, engaged in the Cau&s;e of your neglected Country, and who have done me the Honour of inviting me to this Service; a Service which I am &s;ure I &s;hould perform to your Satisfaction, if my Preparations and Abilities were proportioned to my Benevolence for you, and my Concern for your Succe&s;s: You are peculiarly inte|re&s;ted in the Remarks I have made upon the Text. And that I may contribute all in my Power both to increa&s;e your Number, and direct you to a proper Conduct in the honourable Character you &s;u&s;tain, I &s;hall lay before you a brief View of the pre&s;ent Circum&s;tances of our Country, from which it will appear, that the War in which we are engaged is a Duty, or THE WORK OF THE LORD;
<PB N="4" REF="008333_0008_102F3274730E6770">and con&s;equently, that we are all obliged, according to our re&s;pective Characters, to carry it on with Vigour, under Penalty of falling under the Cur&s;e of God. And then I &s;hall &s;hew you what is the deceitful Performance of the Lord's Work, or un&s;ea&s;onably keeping back of the Sword from Blood, which expo&s;es to the Cur&s;e.</P>
<P N="1">I. I am to lay before you a brief View of the pre&s;ent Circum&s;tances of our Country, which render the War in which we are engaged the Work of the Lord, which con&s;ecrate Swords as In&s;truments of Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and call us to the dreadful but important Duty of &s;hedding of human Blood, upon Penalty of falling under the tremen|dous Cur&s;e of God.</P>
<P>Need I inform you what Barbarities and Depredations a mongrel Race of Indian Savages and French Papi&s;ts have perpetrated upon our Frontiers? How many de&s;erted or demoli&s;hed Hou&s;es and Plantations! How wide an Extent of Country abandoned! How many poor Families obliged to fly in Con&s;ternation, and leave their All behind them! What Breaches and Separations between the neare&s;t Relations! What painful Ruptures of Heart from Heart! What &s;hocking Di&s;per&s;ions of tho&s;e once united by the &s;tronge&s;t and mo&s;t endearing Ties! Some lie dead, man|gled with &s;avage Wounds, con&s;umed to A&s;hes with out|rageous Flames, or torn and devoured by the Bea&s;ts of the Wilderne&s;s, while their Bones lie whitening in the Sun, and &s;erve as tragical Memorials of the fatal Spot where they fell. Others have been dragged away Captives, and made the Slaves of imperious and cruel Savages. Others have made their E&s;cape, and live to lament their butchered or captivated Friends and Relations. In &s;hort, our Frontiers have been drenched with the Blood of our Fellow-Subjects, through the Length of a thou&s;and Miles; and new Wounds are &s;till opening. We, in the&s;e inland Parts of the Country, are as yet unmole&s;ted, through the immerited Mercy of Heaven. But let us glance a Thought to the We&s;tern Extremities of our Body Politick; and
<PB N="5" REF="008333_0009_102F32760A9E27A8">what melancholy Scenes open to our View! Now, perhaps, while I am &s;peaking; now, while you are &s;ecure and un|mole&s;ted, our Fellow-Subjects there may be feeling the Calamities I am de&s;cribing. Now, perhaps, the &s;avage Shouts and Whoops of Indians, and the Screams and Groans of &s;ome butchered Family, may be mingling their Horrors, and circulating their horrendous Echoes thro' the Wilderne&s;s of Rocks and Mountains. Now, perhaps &s;ome tender delicate Creature may be &s;uffering an invo|luntary Pro&s;titution to &s;avage Lu&s;t; and perhaps debauched and murdered by the &s;ame Hand. Now, perhaps, &s;ome mi&s;erable <HI>Briton</HI> or <HI>Virginian</HI> may be pa&s;&s;ing through a tedious Proce&s;s of Experiments in the infernal Art of Torture. Now &s;ome helple&s;s Children may be torn from the Arms of their murdered Parents, and dragged away weeping and wringing their Hands, to receive their Edu|cation among Barbarians, and to be formed upon the Model of a ferocious Indian Soul.</P>
<P>And will the&s;e Violences cea&s;e without a vigorous and timely Re&s;i&s;tance from us? Can Indian Revenge and Thir&s;t for Blood be glutted? or can French Ambition and Avarice be &s;atisfied? No, we have no Method left, but to repel Force with Force, and give them Blood to drink in their Turn, who have drunk ours. If we &s;it &s;till and do nothing, or content our&s;elves, as alas! we have hitherto, with feeble dilatory Efforts, we may expect the&s;e Barbarities will not only continue, but that the Indians, headed by the French, tho&s;e eternal Enemies of Peace, Liberty and Britons, will carry their Inroads &s;till farther into the Country, and reach even to us. By the De&s;ertion of our remote Settlements, the Frontiers are approaching every Day nearer and nearer to us: And if we cannot &s;tand our Ground now, when we have above an hundred Miles of a thick-&s;ettled Country between us and the Enemy, much le&s;s &s;hall we be able, when our Strength is weakened by &s;o va&s;t a Lo&s;s of Men, Arms and Riches, and we lie expo&s;ed to their immediate Incur&s;ions. Some cry, <Q>Let the Enemy come down to us, and then we
<PB N="6" REF="008333_0010_102F327799A65478">will fight them.</Q> But this is the trifling Excu&s;e of Cowardice or Security, and not the Language of Prudence and Fortitude. Tho&s;e who make this Plea, if the Enemy &s;hould take them at their Word, and make them &s;o near a Vi&s;it, would be as forward in Flight, as they are now backward to take up Arms.</P>
<P>Such, my Brethren, &s;uch, alas! is the pre&s;ent State of our Country: It bleeds in a thou&s;and Veins; and without a timely Remedy, the Wound will prove mortal. And in &s;uch Circum&s;tances, is it not our Duty in the Sight of God; is it not a Work to which the Lord loudly calls us, to take up Arms for the Defence of our Country? Cer|tainly it is; and <HI>Cur&s;ed is he,</HI> who having no Ties &s;uffi|ciently &s;trong to confine him at Home, <HI>keepeth his Sword from Blood.</HI> The mean, &s;neaking Wretch, that can de&s;ert the Cau&s;e of his Country in &s;uch an Exigency; his Coun|try, in the Ble&s;&s;ings of which he &s;hared, while in Peace and Pro&s;perity; and which is therefore intitled to his Sympathy and A&s;&s;i&s;tance in the Day of its Di&s;tre&s;s; that cowardly ungrateful Wretch &s;ins again&s;t God and his Country; and de&s;erves the Cur&s;e of both. Such a Conduct in &s;uch a Conjuncture, is a <HI>moral Evil,</HI> a gro&s;s Wicked|ne&s;s; and expo&s;es the Wretch to the heavy Cur&s;e of God both in this and the eternal World.</P>
<P>And here I cannot but ob&s;erve, that among the various and numberle&s;s Sins under which our Country groans, and which mu&s;t be looked upon as the Cau&s;es of our publick Calamities, by every one that believes a Divine Providence; (a Doctrine &s;o comfortable, and &s;o e&s;&s;ential both in Na|tural and Revealed Religion; an Article in the Creed of Heathens and Mahometans, as well as Jews and Chri&s;tians) I &s;ay among the&s;e various Sins, Cowardice and Security are none of the lea&s;t. He that hath determined the Bounds of our Habitation, hath planted us in a Land of Liberty and Plenty; a Land, till lately, unalarmed with the Terrors of War, and un&s;tained with human Blood: Indeed, all Things con&s;idered, there are but few &s;uch happy Spots upon our Globe. And mu&s;t it not highly
<PB N="7" REF="008333_0011_102F327CB3ED6178">provoke our Divine Benefactor, to &s;ee a People thus di&s;tingui&s;hed with Ble&s;&s;ings, &s;o in&s;en&s;ible of their Worth, &s;o ungrateful for them, and &s;o unacquainted with their own Unworthine&s;s to receive them? What can be more evidential of their undue Apprehen&s;ions of the Worth of the&s;e Ble&s;&s;ings, than their being &s;o little concerned to &s;ecure and recover them? The Generality among us have acted, as if their Intere&s;ts at Stake were &s;o trifling, that it would not be worth While to take Pains, or encounter Dangers, to pre&s;erve them. What greater Evidence can be given of Ingratitude, than a &s;upine Neglect of the&s;e Ble&s;&s;ings, and &s;uch a &s;tupidly tame and irre&s;i&s;ting Re&s;ig|nation of them into bloody and rapacious Hands? And what can be more evidential of a proud In&s;en&s;ibility of our Unworthine&s;s of &s;uch Ble&s;&s;ings, than our being &s;o inapprehen&s;ive of lo&s;ing them, even in the mo&s;t threaten|ing and dangerous Circum&s;tances? Our Countrymen in general have acted, as if Beings of their Importance and Merit might certainly re&s;t in the quiet unmole&s;ted Po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of their Liberty and Property, without any one daring to di&s;turb them, and without their doing any Thing for their own Defence; or as if neither God nor Man could &s;trip them of their Enjoyments. What vain &s;elf-confident Pre&s;umption, what intolerable In&s;olence is this, in a &s;inful Nation, a People laden with Iniquity, who have forfeited every Ble&s;&s;ing, even the Ground they tread upon, and the Air they breathe in; and who live meerly by the immerited Grace, and Bounty of God! Is not Cowardice and Security, or an Unwillingne&s;s to en|gage with all our Might in the Defence of our Country, in &s;uch a Situation, an enormous <HI>Wickedne&s;s</HI> in the Sight of God, and worthy of his Cur&s;e, as well as a &s;candalous da&s;tardly <HI>Meanne&s;s</HI> in the Sight of Men, and worthy of publick Shame and Indignation? Is it not fit that tho&s;e who &s;o contemptuou&s;ly depreciate the rich and unde&s;erved Bounties of Heaven, and who &s;well &s;o in&s;olently with a vain Conceit of their own Importance and Worth, &s;hould be puni&s;hed with the Lo&s;s of the&s;e Ble&s;&s;ings? What Di&s;cipline can be more &s;ea&s;onable or congruous?
<PB N="8" REF="008333_0012_102F327EA9D20E00">May we not &s;uppo&s;e, that Divine Providence has permit|ted our Body Politick to &s;uffer Wound after Wound, and baffled all our languid Efforts, in order to give it Sen&s;ibility, and rou&s;e us to exert our Strength in more vigorous Efforts? Has not the Cur&s;e of God lain heavy upon our Country, becau&s;e we have <HI>done the Work of the Lord deceitfully, and kept back our Swords from Blood?</HI></P>
<P>And &s;hall this Guilt increa&s;e from Year to Year, till we are entirely cru&s;hed with the enormous Load? Shall neither the Fear of JEHOVAH'S Cur&s;e, nor the Love of our Country, nor even the Love of our&s;elves, and our own per&s;onal Intere&s;t, con&s;train us at Length to relieve our ravaged Country, and defend the Ble&s;&s;ings which God has entru&s;ted to our Cu&s;tody, as well as lent to us to enjoy? &mdash; Ble&s;&s;ed be God, and Thanks to you, brave Soldiers for what I now &s;ee. I &s;ee you engaged in this good Cau&s;e; and may the effectual Ble&s;&s;ing of Heaven be upon you, in&s;tead of the Cur&s;e entailed upon Cowar|dice and Treachery! But are there no more to join with you? what! none more in this Crowd? None more in Hanover? Hanover! which I think &s;hould &s;hew it&s;elf worthy of Precedence, and exhibit a brave Example to other Counties: This is what may rea&s;onably be expected, from the Number of our Militia, the high Price of our Staple Commodity, the Frequency and Variety of our religious In&s;tructions; and I may add, from our own former good Conduct in &s;uch an Emergency. Hanover had the Honour of &s;ending out the fir&s;t Company of Volunteers that were rai&s;ed in this Colony.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Under Capt. <HI>Averton,</HI> immediately after Gen. <HI>Braddock</HI>'s Defeat.</NOTE> And are we degenerated &s;o &s;oon?

Or are we now inured and hardened to bad News, &s;o that the Calamities of our Frontiers, which have been growing every Year, have now cea&s;ed to be Objects of our Compa&s;&s;ion?</P>
<P>I am &s;orry to tell you, that the Company now forming, is not yet compleated, though under Officers from among your&s;elves, from whom you may expect good U&s;age;

Ye that would catch at Money, here is a proper Bait for you; ten Pounds for a few Months Service, be&s;ides the u&s;ual Pay of Soldiers. I &s;eriou&s;ly make the Propo&s;al to you, not only as a Subject of the be&s;t of Kings, and a Friend to your Country, but as <HI>a Servant of the mo&s;t High God:</HI> for I am fully per&s;uaded what I am recommending, is his Will; and Di&s;obedience to it may expo&s;e you to his Cur&s;e.</P>
<P>This Propo&s;al is not liable to the Objections that have been urged again&s;t former Mea&s;ures for rai&s;ing Men. You can no longer object, <Q>that you are dragged away

And I hope I may add, you need not object, that you &s;hall be badly u&s;ed: For, GENTLEMEN-OFFICERS, may I not promi&s;e for you, that not one Man in your Company &s;hall be treated with Cruelty or Inju&s;tice, as far as your Authority or Influence can pre|vent? May I not be your Security, that none but the Guilty &s;hall be puni&s;hed, and they only according to the Nature of the Offence? Perhaps &s;ome may object, that &s;hould they enter the Army, their Morals would be in Danger of Infection, and their Virtue would be perpe|tually &s;hocked with horrid Scenes of Vice. This may al&s;o be a Di&s;couragement to Parents to con&s;ent to their Children's engaging in &s;o good a Cau&s;e. I am glad to hear this Objection, when it is &s;incere, and not an empty Excu&s;e: And I wi&s;h I could remove it, by giving you an univer&s;al A&s;&s;urance, that the Army is a School of Religion; and that Soldiers, as they are more expo&s;ed to Death than other Men, are proportionably better pre|pared for it than others. But alas! the Rever&s;e of this is too true; and the Contagion of Vice and Irreligion is perhaps no where &s;tronger than in the Army; where, one would think, the &s;upreme Tribunal &s;hould be always in View, and it &s;hould be their chief Care to prepare for Eternity, on the &s;lippery Brink of which they &s;tand every Moment. But, GENTLEMEN-OFFICERS, I mu&s;t again appeal to you, that as for this Company, you will not Impunity; but will always endeavour to recommend and willingly allow any Form of Vice to be practi&s;ed in it with enforce Religion and good Morals by your Example and Authority, and to &s;uppre&s;s the contrary? May I not give
<PB N="11" REF="008333_0015_102F328A0B5B6CC8">the Public the Satisfaction of &s;uch an A&s;&s;urance concer|ning you, that whatever others do, as for you and your Company any you will &s;erve the Lord? Do you not own your&s;elves bound to this in Honour and Duty? Such a Conduct I can a&s;&s;ure you, will render you popular among the Wi&s;e and Good; tho' perhaps it may ex|po&s;e you to the &s;en&s;ele&s;s Contempt of Fools, who <HI>make a Mock of Sin,</HI> and who e&s;teem it Bravery to in&s;ult that God, <HI>in who&s;e Hand their Breath is, and who&s;e are all their Ways.</HI> Such a Conduct will afford you Plea&s;ure in the Review, when the Terrors of the bloody Field are &s;pread round you, and Death &s;tarts up before you in a thou&s;and &s;hocking Forms. Such a Conduct will be a Source of true Courage, and render you nobly indifferent about Life or Death in a good Cau&s;e. And let me hone&s;tly warn you, that if you do not maintain &s;uch a Conduct, you will bitterly repent it either in Time, or Eternity.</P>
<P>But I return to invite others to join with you in this important Expedition.&mdash;What a Crowd of important Arguments pre&s;s you on every Hand? What can our Legi&s;lature do more, than they have done to engage you? If &s;uch unu&s;ual Encouragement does not prevail upon you to enli&s;t as <HI>Volunteers,</HI> what remains but that you mu&s;t be <HI>forced</HI> to it by Authority? For our Country <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be defended: and if nothing but <HI>Force</HI> can con&s;train you to take up Arms in its Defence, then Force <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be u&s;ed: Per&s;ons of &s;uch a &s;ordid unmanly Spirit, are not to expect the U&s;age of <HI>Freemen.</HI>&mdash;Think what the paternal Care or our Sovereign has done for us: and how many Millions of Money, and Thou&s;ands of Men our Mother-Country has furni&s;hed for our Defence. And &s;hall we do nothing for our&s;elves? Great-Britain, I own, is inte|re&s;ted in our Protection: But can &s;he be as much inte|re&s;ted as our&s;elves?&mdash;Con&s;ider what the brave New-England Men have done, after &s;o many Mortifications and Di&s;appointments, and their Trea&s;ury &s;o much exhau&s;ted.

Let us then, in the Name of the Lord of Ho&s;ts, the God of the Armies of I&s;rael, let us collect our whole Strength, and give one deci&s;ive Blow; and we may humbly hope Victory will be ours.</P>
<P>Every one can complain of the bad Management of our public Undertakings, and lament the general Security and Inactivity that prevails.

<P N="2">II. To &s;hew you, what is that deceitful Performance of the Lord's Work, or un&s;ea&s;onable keeping back the Sword from Blood, which expo&s;es to his Cur&s;e.</P>

But as for you of this Company, may I not pre&s;ume that you will behave in a nobler Manner? Shall not Sobriety, public Spirit, Courage, Fidelity, and good Di&s;cipline be maintained among you? This I humbly recommend to you; and may God enable you to act accordingly!</P>
<P>Thus far have I addre&s;&s;ed you as <HI>Soldiers,</HI> or at lea&s;t as Per&s;ons concerned in your Stations to do all in your Power to &s;ave your Country. But we mu&s;t not part thus. It is po&s;&s;ible we may never meet more, till we mingle with the a&s;&s;embled Univer&s;e before the &s;upreme Tribunal: Therefore, before I di&s;mi&s;s you, I mu&s;t addre&s;s my&s;elf to you as <HI>Sinners,</HI> and as <HI>Candidates for Eternity.</HI> You are concerned to &s;ave your <HI>Souls,</HI> as well as your <HI>Country;</HI> and &s;hould you &s;ave or gain a Kingdom, or even the whole World, and lo&s;e your Souls, your Lo&s;s will be irreparable.</P>
<P>None of you I hope will reply, <Q>I am now a Soldier, and have nothing more to do with Religion?</Q> What! has a Soldier Nothing to do with Religion? Is a Soldier under no Obligations to the God that made him, and that furni&s;hes him with every Ble&s;&s;ing? Is not a Soldier as much expo&s;ed to Death as other Men? May not a &s;oldier be damned for as Sin, as well as other Sinners? And will he be able to dwell with devouring Fire and
<PB N="15" REF="008333_0019_102F329498C71FD8">everla&s;ting Burnings? Are the&s;e Things &s;o? Can any of you be &s;o &s;tupid as to think them &s;o? If not, you mu&s;t own, that even a <HI>Soldier</HI> has as much Concern with Religion, as another. Therefore hear me &s;eriou&s;ly upon this Head.</P>
<P>You are about entering into <HI>the School of Vice:</HI> for &s;uch the Army has generally been. And are any of you already initiated into any of the My&s;teries of Iniquity there prac|ti&s;ed? Mu&s;t I &s;o much as &s;uppo&s;e, that &s;ome of you, who have bravely e&s;pou&s;ed the Cau&s;e of your Country, are addicted to Drunkenne&s;s, Swearing, Whoredom, or any gro&s;s Vice? I cannot now take Time to rea&s;on with you for your Conviction; it may &s;uffice to appeal to your own Rea&s;on and Con&s;cience; Do you do well in indulging the&s;e Vices? Will you approve of it in the hone&s;t Hour of Death? Will this Conduct prove a Source of Courage to you, when the Arrows of Death are flying thick around you, and Scores are falling on every Side? No, you are &s;elf-condemned; and may I not rea&s;onably hope, you will endeavour to reform, what you cannot but condemn? Soldiers indeed, are too commonly addicted to &s;uch Immoralities; but are they the better Soldiers on that Account? Can an Oath or a Debauch in&s;pire them with a rational Fortitude again&s;t the Fears of Death? Would not Prayer and a Life of Holine&s;s better an&s;wer this Purpo&s;e? Their Courage, if they have any, mu&s;t be the Effect, not of Thought, but of the Want of Thought; it mu&s;t be a brutal Stupidity, or Ferocity; but not the rational Courage of a Man or a Chri&s;tian.</P>
<P>Some of you, I doubt not, are happily free from the&s;e gro&s;s Vices; and long may you continue &s;o! But I mu&s;t tell you, this <HI>negative</HI> Goodne&s;s is not enough to prepare you for Death, or to con&s;titute you true Chri&s;tians. The Temper of your Minds mu&s;t be changed by the Power of divine Grace; and you mu&s;t be turned from the Love and Practice of all Sin, to the Love and Practice of univer&s;al Holine&s;s. You mu&s;t become humble, broken|hearted Penitents, and true Believers in Je&s;us Chri&s;t.
<PB N="16" REF="008333_0020_102F32964B046388">You mu&s;t be enabled to live righteou&s;ly, &s;oberly, and and godlily, in this pre&s;ent evil World. This is Religion: This is Religion that will keep you uncorruped in the mid&s;t of Vice and Debauchery: this is Religion, that will befriend you, when Cannons roar, and Swords gleam around you, and you are every Moment expecting the deadly Wound: this is Religion, that will &s;upport you in the Agonies of Death, and a&s;&s;ure you of a happy Immortality.</P>
<P>But are not &s;ome of you con&s;cious, that you are de&s;ti|tute of &s;uch a Religion as this? Then it is high Time for you to think on your Condition in &s;ober Sadne&s;s. Pray to that powerful and gracious Being, who can form your Hearts and Lives after this &s;acred Model. Oh! pray earne&s;tly, pray frequently for this Ble&s;&s;ing: and u&s;e all the Means of Grace in that Manner which your Circum|&s;tances will permit.&mdash;Remember al&s;o, that if you try to pro|long your Life by a da&s;tardly Conduct, your Life will lie under the Cur&s;e of Heaven; and you have little Rea|&s;on to hope, you will ever improve it as a Space for Repentance.&mdash;Remember al&s;o to put your Confidence in God; who keeps the Thread of your Life, and the Event of War, in his own Hand. Devoutly acknowledge his Providence in all your Ways, and be &s;en&s;ible of your Dependance upon it.</P>
<P>And now, to conclude my Addre&s;s to you, as the Mouth of this Multitude, and of your Countrymen in general, I heartily bid you farewel. Farewel, my dear Friends, my brave Fellow-Subjects, the Guardians of your poor ravaged Country. God grant you may return in Safety and Honour, and that we may yet welcome you Home, crowned with Laurels of Victory! Or if any of you &s;hould lo&s;e your Lives in &s;o good a Cau&s;e, may you enjoy a glorious and ble&s;&s;ed Immortality in the Region of everla&s;ting Peace and Tranquility! Methinks I may take upon me to promi&s;e you the Prayers and good Wi&s;hes of Thou&s;ands. Thou&s;ands, whom you leave be|hind, will think of you with affectionate Anxiety, will
<PB N="17" REF="008333_0021_102F17AEECC931D8">wi&s;h you Succe&s;s, and congratulate your Return, or lament your Death. Once more I pour out all my Heart in ano|ther affectionate Farewel. May the Lord pre&s;erve your Going out, and your Coming in, from this Time forth and even for ever more. Amen.</P>
<P>Here I thought to have conclued. But I mu&s;t take up a few Minutes more, to a&s;k this Crowd, is there Nothing to be done by us who &s;tay at Home, towards the Defence of our Country, and to promote the Succe&s;s of the Ex|pedition now in Hand? Shall we &s;in on &s;till impenitent and incorrigible? Shall we live as if we and our Country were <HI>&s;elf-dependent,</HI> and had Nothing to do with the Su|preme Ruler of the Univer&s;e? Can an Army of <HI>Saints</HI> or of <HI>Heroes</HI> defend an obnoxious People, ripe for De&s;truction from the righteous Judgment of God? The Cau&s;e in which the&s;e brave Men, and our Army in general, are engaged, is not &s;o much their own as ours. Divine Providence con&s;iders them not &s;o much in their <HI>private</HI> per&s;onal Character, as in their <HI>publick</HI> Character, as the Repre&s;entatives, and Guardians of their Country; and therefore they will &s;tand or fall, not &s;o much according to their own <HI>per&s;onal</HI> Character, as according to the <HI>publick</HI> Character of the People, who&s;e Cau&s;e they have under|taken. Be it known to you, then, their Succe&s;s depends upon us, even more than upon them&s;elves. Therefore let us all turn every one from his evil Ways. <HI>Let the Wicked for&s;ake his Way, &amp;c.</HI> Let us humble our&s;elves under the mighty Hand of God, which is lifted up over our guilty Heads, that we may be exalted in due Time. I could venture the Reputation of my Judgment and Veracity, that it will never be well with our Country, till there be more of the Fear and Love of God in it, and till the Name of Je&s;us be of more Importance among us. I could pre&s;cribe a Method for our Deliverance, which is at once infallible, and al&s;o cheap and &s;afe, and &s;o far from endangering the Life of any, that it would &s;ecure the everla&s;ting Life of all that comply with it.
<PB N="18" REF="008333_0022_102F329E0BD30210">Ye that complain of the Burden of our publick Taxes; ye that love Ea&s;e, and &s;hrink from the Dangers of War; ye that wi&s;h to &s;ee Peace re&s;tored once more; ye that would be happy beyond the Grave, and live for ever, attend to my Propo&s;al: It is this, A THORO' NATIONAL, REFORMATION.
