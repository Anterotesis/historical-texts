<HEAD>THE <HI>HISTORY</HI> OF THE DAVENPORT FAMILY.</HEAD>
<P>IN the North of England lived a gentle|man and lady of the name of Davenport; they had two boys and two girls. Mrs. Da|venport took care her&s;elf of the education of her daughters, whil&s;t her hu&s;band attended to that of the boys. The&s;e children were very good and dutiful to their parents; and, indeed, it would have been a &s;hame had they been otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>Their names were,

<P>Though their hou&s;e was &s;everal miles di&s;|tant from any town, yet it had the advantage of a very good neighborhood; this, however, did not la&s;t all the year, as mo&s;t of the fami|lies who lived thereabout, &s;pent the winter in London: yet, during this dreary &s;ea&s;on, our little family wi&s;hed not for more &s;ociety than was to be found under their own roof; they were always happy and cheerful within them&s;elves. Mrs. Davenport had a brother, who was a widower, with two daughters: Sophia and Amelia Ea&s;y. Having occa&s;ion to vi&s;it the continent, he begged the favor of his brother and &s;i&s;ter to take care of them during their ab&s;ence from &s;chool at Chri&s;t|mas. This reque&s;t was readily complied with; and, accordingly, when the holidays were nearly arrived, Mr. Davenport &s;et off for London, to convey the&s;e young ladies from thence down to his own hou&s;e. Mary and Caroline expected the arrival of their cou&s;ins
<PB N="5" REF="034505_0005_0FFE09BD27245320">with a deal of plea&s;ure. During the week that Mr. Davenport was ab&s;ent, their lei&s;ure hours were employed in making up new clothes for their dolls, and getting all their playthings in order. At length, the happy day arrived, their papa returned, and intro|duced Sophia and Amelia to them; hoping that they would be good friends, and love one another as &s;i&s;ters.</P>
<P>Sophia Ea&s;y was fourteen years old, Amelia was twelve. They had the misfortune to lo&s;e their mother when they were very young, and having been from that time brought up at one of the fir&s;t &s;chools, great attention had been paid to their French, mu|&s;ic, and other accompli&s;hments, but they were girls of very perver&s;e and wayward di&s;|po&s;itions. Sophia was very proud and unwil|ling to take any advice, haughty to &s;ervants, and impertinent to her &s;uperiors; at &s;chool &s;he had connected her&s;elf with a &s;et of tho&s;e &s;illy girls who laughed at every one <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> knew better than them&s;elves, and tyran<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;|ed
<PB N="6" REF="034505_0006_0FFE097B210B6190">over tho&s;e who would not enter into their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">diculous &s;chemes. Amelia was vain and conceited; &s;he never let &s;lip an opportunity <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> admiring her&s;elf in a looking gla&s;s, and, had the time been allowed her, would with plea&s;|ure have &s;pent the whole morning at her toi|let. Be&s;ides the&s;e foibles, they had each of them contracted a habit of telling fal&s;ehoods. Such were the Mi&s;s Ea&s;ys, and from what I have &s;aid of the little Davenports, my young readers will readily &s;uppo&s;e that they were not much plea&s;ed with their vi&s;itors.</P>
<P>Mr. Davenport read &s;hort prayers to the whole family every night, which were always over by nine o'clock, when the children went to bed. They ro&s;e at &s;ix in &s;ummer, and at eight in winter; though u&s;ed to earlier hours at &s;chool, Sophia and Amelia did not chu&s;e to get out of bed till pa&s;t eleven. Mrs. Davenport took no notice of this the fir&s;t morning, thinking that the journey had fa|tigued them; but the next day when the clock &s;truck eleven, and they had not made their appearance, &s;he went up &s;tairs and gent|ly reproved them, adding, that &s;he hoped
<PB N="7" REF="034505_0007_0FFE09BEADB0C700"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> would not happen again. The moment &s;he quitted the room, "Come," &s;ays Amelia to her &s;i&s;ter, "let us get up, or &s;he will be coming again to pla<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e us." "Let her come," <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">; "we have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> to pretend to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">."</P>

<P>After this they continued their conver&s;ation for a long time, till it was interrupted by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> entrance of Caroline; who, coming towards the bed, and gently undrawing the curtains, "Come, my dear cou&s;ins," &s;aid &s;he, "pray get up; for if you &s;tay up &s;tairs any long|er you will vex mama, and I am &s;ure you would not wi&s;h to do &s;o." "I don't care whether &s;he is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> or not," &s;aid Sophia; "what is it to <HI>her</HI> how long we lay in bed?" This was the fir&s;t time Caroline had ever heard her mama &s;poken of &s;lightingly; it hurt her, and &s;he quickly an&s;wered, <Q>My mama is very good,

"This is a very late hour for breakfa&s;t," &s;aid Mrs. Davenport, as they entered the room; we are a regular family, and it mu&s;t not "happen again." "What," &s;aid Sophia, "are we to get up by <HI>four?</HI>" "I did not &s;ay <HI>four,</HI>" replied Mrs. Davenport, rather di&s;plea&s;ed at her pertne&s;s; "but nine is our breakfa&s;t hour, and tho&s;e who are not down by that tim<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">u&s;t go without." This was &s;poken in &s;o re&s;olute a manner that it totally &s;ilenced her nieces. They &s;oon fin|i&s;hed their breakfa&s;t, and Mary took them to walk in the grounds. The &s;harpne&s;s of the

"Study, do you call it?" &s;aid Mary; "well you can|not imagine how we all like it, for papa teaches us; and we find it very entertaining; however, if you do not like it, we will find out &s;ome other amu&s;ement; will you go up &s;tairs and play with our dolls?" "D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> you take us for babies?" &s;aid Amelia. "I am &s;ure I did not mean to affront you," re|plied Mary; "and I do not know what el&s;e to offer you.&mdash;Stay&mdash;now I think of it, there is a great book of prints in the &s;tudy, will you come and look over them?"

<P>HARRY HEADSTRONG had exceeding kind parents, who were willing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o indulge him in
<PB N="15" REF="034505_0015_0FFE09C9CD216788">every thing that was proper; but he, like a fooli&s;h boy, would never take their advice. His papa one day bought a hor&s;e that was rather unruly, and &s;trictly charged his groom never to let Harry ride it. Harry, however, &s;oon found an opportunity for &s;o doing; for one day when his papa was out, he went into the &s;tables, and finding no groom there, he quickly &s;addled the hor&s;e, and was ju&s;t preparing to mount, when his father returned. "What are you doing there, Sir?" &s;aid he.&mdash;"Only going to ride Crop, papa."&mdash;"Then," replied Mr. Head|&s;trong, "you are <HI>only</HI> going to do what I have expre&s;sly forbid; &s;o pray put off your ride for the pre&s;ent; go into the hou&s;e, and let me not &s;ee your face again to day." The next morning, at breakfa&s;t, Mr. Head&s;trong was &s;o good as not to take any notice of what had happened the pre|ceding day: but this indulgence, far from having the proper effect, only &s;erved to make Harry wor&s;e. His father and mother being obliged to go on a vi&s;it for &s;ome days, where they could not conveniently take him with
<PB N="16" REF="034505_0016_0FFE0988301839B0">them, Mr. Head&s;trong, before his departure, gave him &s;ome very good advice, and above all, de&s;ired him upon no account to get upon Crop's back. Harry a&s;&s;ured him he would not, but no &s;ooner was his father gone, than he went to Dick the groom, and contrived to &s;end him out of the way upon &s;ome me&s;&s;age or other. In the mean time, he mounted Crop, and the moment he was out of the &s;ta|ble yard, &s;et off on a gallop. When he had got about a quarter of a mile from the hou&s;e, he wi&s;hed to turn back again, but he checked the bridle in vain&mdash;<HI>on</HI> Crop went, with &s;uch impetuo&s;ity, that Harry could no longer keep his &s;eat.</P>
<P>Luckily, however, before he quite lo&s;t it, he had time to di&s;engage his feet from the &s;tir|rups, otherwi&s;e he mu&s;t have been dragged a con&s;iderable way; which circum&s;tance would, mo&s;t likely, have proved fatal to him, as the road was very uneven and flinty. His fall de|prived him of his &s;en&s;es, and he lay &s;ome time on the ground before any one pa&s;&s;ed by. At la&s;t a countryman came that way, and placing
<PB N="17" REF="034505_0017_0FFE09CC95BB89A0">him upon &s;ome hay in his cart, carried him to his own cottage. As &s;oon as his wife &s;aw Harry, "Good lack a day!" quoth &s;he, "if this is not '&s;quire Head&s;trong's own &s;on and heir! goodne&s;s me! if he &s;hould die!&mdash;do, there's a good man," &s;aid &s;he to her hu&s;|band, "take Ball, and ride to tow<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> for a &s;ur|geon, <HI>pathecary,</HI> or &s;omething." Tomkin thought Joan's advice was good, &s;o getting on Ball, he trotted away to the next town. Dur|ing his ab&s;ence, Harry came to him&s;elf, but was &s;o brui&s;ed, that he could not move. Mo|ther Joan was a good &s;ort of a woman enough, but was rather inqui&s;itive, and not a little talkative. She make Harry relate the whole adventure, and interrupted him every mo|ment with &s;ome remark or other. At la&s;t, when he had fini&s;hed, &s;he exclaimed, <Q>Good gemini! how could you be &s;o venture&s;ome! 'Tis well for you that you did not break your neck; nay, I don't know but what <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">'ve got &s;ome broken bones as it is. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> will the '&s;quire &s;ay! he will be out of his wits almo&s;t.</Q> Harry &s;uffered &s;o much pain that he hardly knew what the
<PB N="18" REF="034505_0018_0FFE098C550604E0">good woman &s;aid, but lay crying and roar|ing at a great rate. "Oh," &s;ays Joan, <Q>you mu&s;t not be in &s;uch low &s;pirits neither.</Q> She then ran out of the room, and quickly returned with a cup of elder wine made hot with &s;pices. It was lucky for Harry that the &s;urgeon arrived ju&s;t time enough to prevent the do&s;e, for had he taken it, it would have increa&s;ed his fever much, which was already at an alarming height. Mr. Hopkin &s;aid, that none of his bones were broke, but gave it as his opinion, that he ought to be removed to his father's hou&s;e. This was agreed to, and for three weeks he kept his bed, dangerou&s;ly ill. When his father and mother heard of the misfortune, they ha&s;tened back; &s;o that, in&s;tead of &s;taying from home a fortnight, as they had originally intended, they were ab&s;ent but one day.</P>
<P>Any one would &s;uppo&s;e that this accident would have been &s;ufficient to warn <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">rry from di&s;obeying his parents again; indeed it made an impre&s;&s;ion upon him for &s;ome time, but this wore away by degrees, and he be|come
<PB N="19" REF="034505_0019_0FFE09CF60157C58">as bad as ever. At la&s;t he grew &s;o mi&s;chievous, that no gentlemen would &s;uffer their &s;ons to keep company with him, fear|ing they &s;hould follow his bad example. His father kept pi&s;tols in his bed chamber, and they were generally lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ded: Harry was or|dered never to touch them, and that he might have no opportunity of doing it, he was for|bid entering the room. One day, however, when Mr. and Mrs. Head&s;trong, were gone out to dinner, he &s;tole in unperceived by the &s;ervants, and getting one of them down, he pulled the trigger and di&s;charged it. Unhap|pily the pi&s;tol had not been looked at for &s;ome time, and was in &s;o bad a condition that it bur&s;t. The con&s;equence was, that his hand was &s;hattered in &s;o terrible a manner that he was forced to have it cut off. The excrutiat|ing pain he then underwent, made him re|flect &s;eriou&s;ly on his di&s;obedience. Oh! (thought he to him&s;elf) if I had but minded what my father &s;aid to me, I &s;hould never have &s;uffered thus! In fine, this la&s;t accident
<PB N="20" REF="034505_0020_0FFE09905FF23CE8">had &s;o good an effect upon him, that for the future he did every thing his parents de&s;ired him to do, and con&s;equently became a very good boy.</P>

"My dear Charles," &s;aid he one day, <Q>how, when you grow older, will you ever be able to &s;tudy at all, if, whil&s;t young, you make a practice of &s;kipping every page that is not enlivened with an anecdote: You will next get into a habit of never reading any but trifling books, that contain no real in|formation, but only &s;erve to amu&s;e for an hour or two at be&s;t.</Q> Mr. Davenport now entered, and inquired how they had been em|ployed.

<P>The &s;econd dinner bell now rang, and they all went together into the eating room. Af|ter dinner the children all went up into an unfurni&s;hed room that was kept on purpo&s;e for them to run about in, when the weather was bad. Here they amu&s;ed them&s;elves with b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">d man's buff, thread the needle, &amp;c. till a &s;ervant acquainted them that tea was ready.

Sophia and Amelia were half determined not to ri&s;e any earlier than they had hither to done; but recollecting, that by &s;o doing, they might go without their break|fa&s;t, they thought it better to obey, and ac|cordingly were down by half pa&s;t eight. Mrs. Davenport commended their punctuality, but as &s;he had di&s;cernment enough <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> di&s;cov|er the true cau&s;e, it gave her pain to think, that nothing but the fear of puni&s;hment was &s;ufficient to make them act p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">ly.

It to the&s;e we add Harry Lively, the Dav|enport, and their cou&s;ins, we &s;hall find ju&s;t enough to make nine couple. They began dancing at &s;ix o'clock, and would willingly have continued their &s;port till midnight, if Mrs. Davenport had thought proper; but that lady judged ten a better hour for &s;upper, as none of them were above fourteen years old.

You mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible how much more comfortable you are in that &s;itua|tion, than if you had &s;pent the holidays at &s;chool. You, my dear children, have no mother alive: there mu&s;t be many little things to correct in your di&s;po&s;itions, which I have no opportunity of attending to, and which your governe&s;s, having &s;o many more young people under her care, is very likely to overlook. But yet, the&s;e circum&s;tances form no ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters"> for any mi&s;hehaviour of your's, as you have an aunt who is highly ca|pable of directing you, and loves you as if you were her own children.

<P>Though Sophia and Amelia were very glad to hear from their father, they were not al|together plea&s;ed to find that he differed from them in thinking that they were to pay obe|dience to Mrs. Davenport. They were &s;o fooli&s;h as to imagine that &s;he only reproved them for the &s;ake of finding fault, and were inwardly determined to pay <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> more atten|tion to her than they had hitherto done. They kept their re&s;olution; and though Mrs. Dav|enport was always propo&s;ing &s;ome party of
<PB N="29" REF="034505_0029_0FFE09DDD11A0188">plea&s;ure for them, they took no pains to plea&s;e her in return.</P>
<P>As to their getting up early in the morn|ing, though their aunt was continually re|pre&s;enting to them how unwhole&s;ome it is to &s;pend &s;o many hours in bed, they did not heed her, till Mrs. Davenport put her threat in execution of letting them go without their beakfa&s;t, if they were not down by nine o'clock. She was &s;orry to be obliged to have recour&s;e to &s;o har&s;h a method, but finding that a milder one had no effect upon them, thought it her duty to do all &s;he could, to make them follow a cu&s;tom &s;o beneficial to their health. Twelfth Night now came on, and Mrs. Davenport, &s;till indulgent, again invited the young people who were at the dance. Her own maid &s;upplied the place of a pa&s;try-cook, and in&s;tead of &s;ugar figures, which generally con&s;titute the prizes on this occa&s;ion, Mr. Davenport made up &s;everal parcels containing toys, &amp;c. with names pin|ned upon them to an&s;wer to tho&s;e which they

<P>The young people were all much plea&s;ed with their pre&s;ents, and &s;pent the evening very happily in examining them and playing at different games till their &s;eparate carriages arrived.

They were rejoiced to &s;ee her, for they all loved and re&s;pected her greatly, as
<PB N="32" REF="034505_0032_0FFE099FF1BEAE20">&s;he never quitted them without leaving marks of her bounty behind her. It was not for the&s;e vi&s;its alone that they were indebted to her, for &s;he frequently <HI>&s;ent</HI> them clothes, butcher's meat, &amp;c. &amp;c. and in winter they came every other day for &s;oup, which Mrs. Davenport cau&s;ed her &s;ervants to di&s;tribute in quantities according to the number of dif|ferent families. Mary and Caroline, too, of|ten begged of their mama to let them make &s;ome clothes for the younger children, which reque&s;t Mrs. Davenport was ever ready to agree to; and &s;uch great plea&s;ure did they find in this employment, that when they had done any thing worthy of a reward, Mrs. Davenport gave them m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">erials for making a petticoat, gown, &amp;c. for &s;ome little pea&s;ant girl or other. Mary was this day provided with a gown for Madge, their late gardener's daughter, and Caroline with a petticoat; as they had ob&s;erved, the la&s;t time they paid the little girl a vi&s;it, that &s;he was in great want of both the&s;e articles. Now, as I think it ve|ry likely that my young readers wi&s;h to know

<P>When they had all &s;tepped into the car|riage, the &s;ervant put in a bundle containing little Madge's gown and petticoat. "What's this," &s;aid Sophia; "what are you put|ting this in for?"&mdash;"Oh," &s;ays Caroline, that bundle belongs to me and my &s;i&s;ter; it mu&s;t not be left behind upon any ac|count"&mdash;<HI>"Indeed but it &s;hall,"</HI> returned So|phia, "if it is to be placed again&s;t my feet in this manner."&mdash;"Well then." &s;aid Caroline, I will take it up in my lap; pray don't quarrel about it." "Pray, mi&s;s Caroline," &s;aid Amelia (who &s;at upon the &s;ame &s;ide), "don't think I'll permit the na&s;ty bundle to crowd <HI>me</HI> up; is not the coach full enough already, without <HI>bundles?</HI>" Mrs. Davenport ca&s;t an angry look at her nieces,
<PB N="34" REF="034505_0034_0FFE09A2D5070A98">and without &s;aying any thing to them, order|ed "the po&s;tillions <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o drive on.

<P>Mrs. Davenport, however, forbade the &s;er|vant to take it, and turning to her niece, <Q>Here, Amelia, let <HI>me</HI> have it; it takes up but very little room, and even if it were <HI>twice</HI> as big, you ought not to complain; but I hope you will cea&s;e &s;o to do, when you know what it contains.</Q> She then opened it, and di&s;playing the contents, &s;aid, <Q>The&s;e clothes are for a poor little girl who wants them very much this cold weather, as her own are very old and thread-bare; would you then be &s;o uncharitable as to &s;uffer her to remain a week or two longer in this uncomfortable &s;ituation, becau&s;e you cannot &s;ubmit to the &s;mall inconve|nience of being crowded for a little time?

<P>That is very likely, indeed, when coals hereabouts are as <HI>cheap as dirt,</HI> and you cannot &s;tir half a dozen &s;teps without meet|ing with a coal-pit. There is not a &s;ingle cottage that has not a roaring fire in it.</P>

<P>What, madam! your brother Henry? I beg pardon&mdash;I recollect you had no other. Ah! your brother Henry, he u&s;ed to love me dearly&mdash;I remember he had a lit|tle garden of his own&mdash;I marked it out for him&mdash;a pretty little fellow he was, with his little ro&s;y cheeks and hazle eyes; I think I &s;ee him now running towards me, with his brown hair blowing about; "Here Jo&s;eph, Jo&s;eph," cried he, "my papa has been &s;o kind, he has given me leave to have a piece of ground to <HI>my&s;elf,</HI> if <HI>you</HI> will give it me, in one of the kitchen gardens, or any where you plea&s;e out of &s;ight; for my papa &s;ays, he &s;uppo&s;es I &s;hall make fine work of it; and as you like to keep the plea&s;ure-arounds &s;o neat, he thought you would not wi&s;h me to have it thereabouts."

<P>Mrs. Davenport made the old man very happy, by informing him that &s;he expected her brother every week: Jo&s;eph had not &s;een him for near four years; for when Mr. Ea&s;y was la&s;t at Thorne Park, he (the old man) was gone into Wales, to tran&s;act &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s for his landlord, Mr. Davenport.

<P>Mrs. Davenport, upon quitting the hou&s;e, inquired of Joan, whether there was any thing they wanted; adding that till &s;he had an opportunity of calling again, &s;he &s;hould

Jo&s;eph's wife returned her many thanks, &s;aid, they wanted nothing at pre&s;ent, and that if Mr. Ea&s;y would honor them with a vi&s;it, it would give great plea&s;ure to her poor hu&s;band; but, as the &s;ur|pri&s;e might be too much for him in his pre|&s;ent weak &s;tate, begged of Mrs. Davenport to let them know an hour or two beforehand.

The fairy, Ben|evolenta, who pre&s;ided <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> her birth, had fore|told, that if her father <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> mother kept her in the palace after &s;he was two years old, it would prove a great &s;ource of unea&s;ine&s;s to both parties. She perceived that this predic|tion gave them great pain, and in &s;ome mea&s;|ure to mitigate it, propo&s;ed her own habita|tion as a proper a&s;ylum for Melpomene, till &s;uch time as her magical books &s;hould inform her that &s;he might live with her father and mother. The queen acknowledged her&s;elf much obliged to Benevolenta for this offer, but inwardly determined not to profit by it, as &s;he could not imagine where a daughter could be &s;o well &s;ituated as under a father's roof. The king was of the &s;ame opinion with his royal con&s;ort; he had long wi&s;hed for a child, and now when he had got one,
<PB N="64" REF="034505_0064_0FFE0A0DE8B259A8">was in no great hurry to part with it. When Melpomene was a month old, the queen was carried round the city in a car made of ivory and gold, drawn by white hor&s;es, harne&s;&s;ed with white and &s;ilver ribbon, and led by little boys, dre&s;&s;ed in white, and garlands of ro&s;es. Four and twenty g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">s (none older than twelve preceded the carriage, &s;trewing flowers. The queen's hou&s;ehold clo&s;ed the proce&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>When the fe&s;tival was over, the fairy Ben|evolenta took her leave of the king and queen, and taking Melpomene in her arms, ki&s;&s;ed her tenderly, and turning to the queen, "Oh, A&s;teria!" &s;aid &s;he, <Q>have compa&s;&s;ion on this poor babe: &s;acrifice a little &s;elf-gratification to her happine&s;s, and when the de&s;tined hour arrives, con&s;ign her to my care; and though maternal fondne&s;s mu&s;t regret the &s;eparation, be not &s;o weak as to give way to a wi&s;h, which, if gratified, will involve your child in mi&s;ery.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="034505_0065_0FFE0A53432C9B58">
She then waved her wand, and immediate|ly a car appeared in the heavens, drawn by four doves; it de&s;cended, and mounting it, &s;he was pre&s;ently out of &s;ight.</P>
<P>Two years &s;oon pa&s;&s;ed away: Benevolenta appeared in Ro&s;yland, and conjured A&s;teria to confide the prince&s;s to her care. But the queen was inexorable; neither threats or en|treaties could prevail upon her to part with her darling. The king was equally ob&s;tinate, and Benevolenta departed with infinite re|gret. Her enxiety for the fate of the prin|ce&s;s, and natural goodne&s;s of heart, prompt|ed her to take a long and very dangerous journey, in order to con&s;ult a &s;uperior gen|ius, re&s;pecting the po&s;&s;ibility of &s;oftening the rigor of her de&s;tiny. From him &s;he received the following an&s;wer:</P>
<P><Q>If Melpomene had quitted Ro&s;yland at the age of TWO YEARS, her days would have been crowned with bli&s;s. Her ill-judging parents, by their folly, have doom|ed
<PB N="66" REF="034505_0066_0FFE0A10D116AA10">her to future mi&s;ery. But as our be|loved fairy, Benevolenta, has intere&s;ted her&s;elf in the fate of the child, it is decreed that her mi&s;ery will not be ENDLESS.</Q></P>
<P>The fairy was overjoyed upon hearing this decree; and immediately &s;et out for Ro&s;y|land. Upon entering the palace, &s;he ob&s;erv|ed all the attendants countenances filled with di&s;may. She eagerly inquired the cau&s;e, and was told by one of them, that the prince&s;s had that morning been &s;tolen away by an in|vi&s;ible hand. She was making farther inqui|ries re&s;pecting the truth of this intelligence, when &s;he perceived A&s;teria approaching. She appeared half di&s;tracted, &s;taring wildly about her, and calling upon the prince&s;s. Benevolenta ha&s;tily went to meet and em|brace her, but the queen &s;tarting back, ex|claimed, <Q>It is not <HI>&s;he!</HI> Why did you tell me &s;he was found! You all take plea&s;ure in deceiving me, but I do not care&mdash;Benevo|lenta will &s;oon be here, and &s;he will tell me news of her. <HI>She</HI> will not be &s;o cruel.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="034505_0067_0FFE0A54CA056630">
"I am Benevolenta," returned the fairy (&s;hocked at her &s;ituation,) <Q>I am Benevolen|ta, come to give you comfort.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Queen.</HI> YOU Benevolenta!&mdash;No, no! do not think I will believe it. Do you imagine I do not know Benevolenta when I &s;ee her? Benevolenta is by far more kind than you.</P>
<P>The fairy finding it was impo&s;&s;ible to ad|mini&s;ter con&s;olation to the queen in her pre|&s;ent &s;tate of mind, con&s;igned her to the care of her dome&s;tics &s;trictly charging them not to lo&s;e &s;ight of her for one moment. She her&s;elf repaired to the king's apartments, where &s;he found him in all the agonies of &s;or|row. "Oh! my friend," &s;aid he, <Q>in what a &s;ituation do you find me! To what pur|po&s;e was a child granted to my prayers, if I was to be bereft of it &s;o &s;oon?</Q></P>
<P>"Stop!" cried Benevolenta, <Q>when the &s;uperior Powers ble&s;&s;ed thee with a daughter, they conditioned that &s;he was to
<PB N="68" REF="034505_0068_0FFE0A13A096D1B8">quit thy roof at the age of two years, and not to return for a certain &s;pace of time. You have dared to counteract their de&s;igns: you have been told of the con&s;equences that would en&s;ue. This misfortune is but the beginning of the mi&s;ery you have prepar|ed for her. It is your own work; do not arraign the ju&s;tice of the higher powers, be|cau&s;e you have been pre&s;umptuous enough to draw down their anger by di&s;obedience to their commands.</Q></P>
<P>"Oh!" replied the king <Q>do not add to my mi&s;ery by the&s;e ju&s;t reproaches. I have been greatly to blame; and I now, with &s;ufficient weight, feel the puni&s;hment of my errors. But I have &s;till a &s;mall ray of hope left:&mdash;From you I expect &s;uccour&mdash; intercede for me, and</Q>&mdash;</P>
<P>"It is already done," replied the fairy; <Q>I have obtained from the great ALMANZO-ROASTER a promi&s;e, that &s;he will not <HI>always</HI> be unhappy, THAT HER MISERY WILL NOT BE ENDLESS.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="034505_0069_0FFE0A57AA2A3C38">
The king, upon hearing the&s;e la&s;t words, threw him&s;elf at the fairy's feet, and caught hold of her robe. "Benevolenta," &s;aid he; <Q>you have re&s;tored me to life; you have laid me under eternal obligations. Then you <HI>can</HI> give me hopes of my daughter; I &s;hall again have her in my arms, again embrace her! what joy!&mdash;But while I thus anticipate my delights, what may &s;he be enduring!

<P>The&s;e interrogations troubled the fairy. She well knew his conjectures were very well founded; but, fearing to increa&s;e his anxie|ty, totally di&s;couraged them: adding, that &s;he had not the lea&s;t doubt but that the prin|ce&s;s would &s;oon be re&s;tored to him and his be|loved con&s;ort; and, a&s;&s;uring him of her ut|mo&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;tance, vani&s;hed from his &s;ight, and the in&s;tant &s;he found her&s;elf in her own pa|lace,

<HEAD>THE <HI>HISTORY</HI> OF THE DAVENPORT FAMILY.</HEAD>
<P>THE next morning as they were &s;itting at breakfa&s;t, they heard the &s;ound of a car|riage driving up the avenue: They all jump|ed up from the table, and running to the window, with one voice exclaimed, "Here "he is! Here he is!" In an in&s;tant the par|lour door flew open, and Mr. Ea&s;y entered. I &s;hould have much to &s;ay, were I to repeat all that was &s;aid on both &s;ides upon this happy meeting; tho&s;e who have affectionate fath|ers, uncles, and brothers, can ea&s;ily picture to them&s;elves what pa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="034505_0076_0FFE0A1C2091C0D8">
Mr. Ea&s;y was a valuable acqui&s;ition to this little &s;ociety; to a good heart, he joined an excellent under&s;tanding, an improved mind, and elegant manners. He and Mr. Davenport were educated at the &s;ame &s;chool, travelled together, and their di&s;po&s;itions being alike, they formed a friend&s;hip, which increa&s;ed with their years, and which was afterwards &s;trongly cemented by the union of Mr. Ea&s;y's &s;i&s;ter with Mr. Davenport.</P>
<P>Mr. Ea&s;y al&s;o married, but unfortunately lo&s;t his wife two months after the birth of his younge&s;t daughter, who, being a very &s;ick|ly child, did not &s;urvive her mother many weeks.</P>
<P>Sophia and Amelia were very fond of their father, and, indeed, it would have been &s;ing|ular if they had not, as he ever treated them with true paternal tenderne&s;s. 'Tis true, they enjoyed but little of his &s;ociety, as they never &s;aw him, but when he paid them occa|&s;ional vi&s;its at &s;chool; but then he always te&s;tified &s;o much plea&s;ure in being with them, and &s;o affectionately attended to all their little
<PB N="77" REF="034505_0077_0FFE0A6700D0A610">reque&s;ts, that he was as dear to them as if they had always lived together.</P>
<P>After the de&s;cription I formerly gave of the&s;e two &s;i&s;ters, the above may &s;eem extraor|dinary, but then my readers mu&s;t con&s;ider, that their di&s;po&s;itions were &s;uch as could not hear contradiction, and therefore, while Mr. Ea&s;y had no opportunity of thwarting their inclinations, they behaved properly towards him: but it will &s;oon appear, that, from the moment he had occa&s;ion to exert his parental authority, they were no longer the &s;ame af|fectionate children.</P>
<P>This little family had &s;o many intere&s;ting &s;ubjects for conver&s;ation, that when the din|ner bell rang, they were quite &s;urpri&s;ed to find it &s;o late. The evening &s;tole off impercepti|bly, and they all went to bed in high good hu|mour.</P>
<P>The next morning, early, Charles and George took a walk to old Jo&s;eph's cottage, in order to prepare him for a vi&s;it from their uncle in the cour&s;e of the day. The good couple were delighted with this intelligence the old man in particular, who declared he
<PB N="78" REF="034505_0078_0FFE0A1EEF33B998">felt him&s;elf younger for it by four or five years. Before the boys had got half way home, they met Mr. Ea&s;y, who could not re&s;train his impatience to &s;ee his old friend; they join|ed him, and were witne&s;&s;es to a very affecting &s;cene upon their arrival at the cottage, where they &s;taid above an hour, and upon their re|turn home, found breakfa&s;t almo&s;t over. Mr. Ea&s;y acknowledged him&s;elf much obliged to his brother and &s;i&s;ter for their attention to|wards his old friend, adding, that he knew no body more de&s;erving of their charity.</P>
<P>"Pray, Sir," &s;aid Sophia, <Q>why are you &s;o particularly fond of old Jo&s;eph? I know he is a very good man, but he was but a common &s;ervant.</Q></P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Ea&s;y.</SPEAKER>
<P>"A common &s;ervant, my dear Sophia! and is that any rea&s;on why I &s;hould not re&s;pect his virtues?"</P>

<SPEAKER>Sophia.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, papa, but I think there is no occa&s;ion to go and &s;it whole hours with a gardener.</P>

<P>I am &s;orry you are of that opin|ion, I &s;hould by no mean<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> wi&s;h my children to pa&s;s their time in the &s;ervant's hall, or to make confidential friends of them; but I can|not

But, my dear Sophia, where did you get the&s;e &s;trange notions? I am &s;ure your cou&s;ins think very differently; I wi&s;h you would learn from them, that when the lower &s;ort of people fulfil their duty, it is incum|bent upon their &s;uperiors to treat them at all times with affability, and in &s;uch a ca&s;e as this with re&s;pect.</P>

<P>With <HI>re&s;pect,</HI> papa!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mr. Ea&s;y.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, Sophia, with <HI>re&s;pect;</HI> I owe it to Jo&s;eph as being &s;o much older, and con&s;equently, more experienced than my&s;elf; and I don't know a man upon earth more hon|e&s;t and faithful than he is. To be &s;ure, he has neither birth or riches to boa&s;t of, but that does not in the lea&s;t le&s;&s;en his title to re|&s;pect in my opinion.</P>
</SP>
<P>Mr. Ea&s;y being very de&s;irous of going to &s;ee &s;ome improvements that had been lately made on his e&s;tate, which joined to Mr. Da|venport's, and as he wi&s;hed his brother and

<P>Mary, Caroline, Sophia, and Amelia now went to take a walk in the garden, where the following dialogue pa&s;&s;ed between them.</P>

Mary and Caroline perceiving their cou|&s;ins had no inclination to talk with them, took the fir&s;t opportunity of turning down another walk.</P>
<P>"I wi&s;h," &s;aid Mary, "my cou&s;ins were a <Q>little better tempered; I thought we &s;hould have been very happy together, but they will hardly take any notice of us, and then whenever mama gives them any little piece of advice, they only &s;neer and look at each other as if they were determined not to profit by it.</Q></P>

</SP>
<P>The two little Davenports quitted the gar|den, highly di&s;gu&s;ted with the behaviour of their vi&s;itors; but being con&s;cious that they had nothing to reproach them&s;elves with, they &s;oon forgot their anger. Mary had gath|ered a crocus which &s;he &s;at down quietly to copy in water colours, and Caroline took &s;ome ribbon out of her work bag, with which &s;he began to make a watch chain for her brother George, who, together with Charles, had accompanied the chai&s;e on hor&s;eback.</P>
<P>There were large wooden &s;hutters on the out&s;ide of the windows belonging to the room where Mary and Caroline were &s;itting: So|phia and Amelia perceiving the&s;e, agreed to clo&s;e them all on a &s;udden, and by that means prevent their cou&s;ins from pur&s;uing their amu&s;ements in that apartment. They put their &s;cheme in execution, and Mary and Caroline were forced to retire to their own room above flairs. The&s;e childi&s;h ill-natured &s;i&s;ters then began to throw &s;now balls at the windows, nor would they de&s;i&s;t, till they had
<PB N="84" REF="034505_0084_0FFE0A274D57EC90">cracked three or four panes of gla&s;s: this, however, put an end to their pelting, and they ran into the hou&s;e with their dirty clogs on, up the be&s;t &s;tairs, and bouncing again&s;t their cou&s;ins' door, demanded entrance. Receiv|ing no an&s;wer, they called them every abu&s;ive name they could think of, and thumped and kicked as if they had been breaking through the door.</P>
<P>Mary now rang the bell, which communi|cated with the hou&s;ekeeper's room, where Mrs. Davenport's own maid generally &s;at. Mrs. Anne upon coming up, found the Mi&s;s Ea&s;ys had brought chairs and tables out of their own bed chambers, and piled them up in &s;uch a manner, that if the little pri&s;oners had unlocked the door (which opened in|wardly) they would all have tumbled upon them and probably have hurt them much. She attempted to take them down, which irritat|ed Amelia to &s;o great a degree, that &s;he flew at her, and began pinching and thumping her in a threatening tone, commanding her to de&s;i&s;t.</P>
<P>Anne was a good tempered young woman, but had no notion of receiving a blow from any one, e&s;pecially when &s;he was con&s;cious
<PB N="85" REF="034505_0085_0FFE0A7106B51E08">&s;he had given no ju&s;t provocation. She there|fore made not the lea&s;t &s;cruple of returning it. Upon which Sophia, who had all along been encouraging her &s;i&s;ter, ran now to her a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance. The poor maid &s;eeing that &s;he was like|ly to come off the wor&s;t, di&s;engaged her&s;elf from her antagoni&s;ts, and made all the ha&s;te &s;he could down &s;tairs. Sophia and Amelia were pur&s;uing her, when they heard Mrs. Davenport's voice in the hall, who was that moment come home. They turned &s;hort, went up &s;tairs (three &s;teps at a time) into their own room, and locked them&s;elves in.</P>
<P>Anne immediately informed her lady of what had happened, making an apology for the lib|erty &s;he had taken in &s;triking Mi&s;s Amelia, but that &s;he really had done it in her own de|fence. Mrs. Davenport replied, <Q>it was a pity &s;he had been forced to go &s;uch lengths, but &s;he could not blame her for what &s;he had done.</Q> She then de&s;ired her to remove the chairs, &amp;c. and &s;end Mary and Caroline down to her in the library. The little girls obeyed, and were ordered to relate the circum&s;tances of the affray, which they did immediately, but without either ju&s;tifying their own conduct, or
<PB N="86" REF="034505_0086_0FFE0A28D55C9508">condemning that of their cou&s;ins. Their ma|ma had never had any rea&s;on to doubt their veracity; &s;he approved very much of their behaviour, and undertook her&s;elf to &s;ettle the quarrel.</P>
<P>When dinner was &s;erved, Mrs. Davenport &s;ent Mary to tell them, that both dinner bells had rang; but they told her (through the door) that they were not hungry, and did not choo&s;e to come down. Mary whi&s;pered this to her mama, upon which Mrs. Daven|port repeated it to her hu&s;band and brother, who were very de&s;irous to know what had been the matter which &s;he promi&s;ed to in|form them of, when the &s;ervants had with|drawn.</P>
<P>According to her promi&s;e, as &s;oon as the de|&s;ert was upon the table, &s;he related the whole affair, and concluded with &s;aying, that &s;he &s;hould take no notice of them, and that &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed when they were tired of being alone they would come down. "Upon my word," &s;aid Mr. Ea&s;y, <Q>they give them&s;elves great airs; but I'm quite of your opinion, the
<PB N="87" REF="034505_0087_0FFE0A73D114F490">le&s;s notice we take of them the better; they mortify <HI>them&s;elves,</HI> not <HI>us.</HI></Q></P>
<P>"Certainly," &s;aid his brother, <Q>if we &s;end up to them, it will directly confirm them in the opinion they entertain of their own con|&s;equence.</Q></P>
<P>It was therefore &s;ettled, that nobody was to go to them, not even a maid to help them to undre&s;s, or to take them any refre&s;hment.</P>
<P>Tea came up, but &s;till the Mi&s;s Ea&s;ys did not make their appearance.</P>
<P>The following morning, when Ann went up to Mary and Caroline, they inquired if &s;he had &s;een Sophia and Amelia?</P>
<P>"Oh, yes," Ma'am, &s;aid &s;he, <Q>they were down before it was light, tea&s;ing the &s;cul|lion (the only &s;ervant up) for &s;omething to eat; but Bridget, who is not over civil, told them they mu&s;t wait with patience till Mrs. Davies was <HI>&s;tirring,</HI> as &s;he had &s;hut up the larder over night: then they went up a|gain, and began making a mon&s;trous noi&s;e. At &s;even Mrs. Davies gave them &s;ome bread and butter, but they abu&s;ed her, becau&s;e there was no water boiling to make them tea, though &s;he told the dairy maid to give them
<PB N="88" REF="034505_0088_0FFE0A2E289ED590">&s;ome milk, warm from the cow; they are now &s;itting in the breakfa&s;t parlour, be|fore the fire, with their feet on the &s;ender, talking again&s;t every body in the hou&s;e.</Q></P>
<P>I mu&s;t not here omit a good natured action performed by Mary and Caroline.</P>
<P>When they quitted their room, they &s;aw their cou&s;ins' door open, upon which they went in, and found the carpet rolled up in a heap, the bed curtains twi&s;ted round the po&s;ts, the pictures turned with their faces to the wall, and the whole apartment in confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>They knew this would make their mama very angry, and though they had &s;o much rea&s;on to be offended with their cou&s;ins, they immediately began putting every thing in order, to prevent them from getting into far|ther trouble. This took a great deal of time to accompli&s;h, and though they made as much ha&s;te as po&s;&s;ible, the clock &s;truck nine before they had quite fini&s;hed&mdash;they were therefore forced to neglect their morning's ex|erci&s;e, which Mrs. Davenport generally look|ed over, immediately after breakfa&s;t. They were now in a great dilemma; they wi&s;hed much to &s;creen Sophia and Amelia from their

<PB N="90" REF="034505_0090_0FFE0A2FAF1617A8">mama's anger; but it could not now be done, but at the expen&s;e of their own veraci|ty, as Mrs. Davenport would not fail to a&s;k how they had been employing them&s;elves.</P>
<P>They had never deceived their mama in the mo&s;t trivial affair, and therefore re&s;olved to declare the whole truth, and rely upon her indulgence in pardoning the offenders.</P>
<P>They accordingly met her upon the &s;tairs, and begged her, as an indulgence to <HI>them|&s;elves,</HI> not to &s;ay any thing about what had pa&s;&s;ed to their cou&s;ins.</P>
<P>Mrs. Davenport embraced them, and com|mending them for their good nature, promi&s;|ed to attend to their reque&s;t, and all three en|tered the breakfa&s;t room together.</P>
<P>"Here they come," &s;aid the elde&s;t, as they opened the door, "now for a &s;ermon!"</P>
<P>Though Mrs. Davenport di&s;tinctly heard this impertinent &s;peech, &s;he did not chu&s;e to notice it, but &s;at down to the table, and with|out &s;peaking a word to her nieces, ordered Caroline to wring for the tea kettle. So|phia did not offer to move, though &s;he &s;at clo&s;e to the bell; Caroline endeavoured to reach it over her cou&s;in's chair, but finding that
<PB N="91" REF="034505_0091_0FFE0A7969EF1F68">impracticable, &s;he whi&s;pered, <Q>Pray Sophia, move a little;</Q> upon which Sophia with|out ri&s;ing, took hold of her chair with both her hands, and bounced her&s;elf away with &s;uch violence, that &s;he overthrew a &s;creen that &s;tood behind her. Amelia bur&s;t into a loud laugh, but &s;till her aunt took no notice. The hot water was brought in, and Mrs. Dav|enport made tea. She gave a cup to each of the girls, but Sophia and Amelia refu&s;ed it, &s;aying, "they cho&s;e coffee."</P>

<SPEAKER>Mr. Ea&s;y.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wi&s;h you would advi&s;e me what method to pur&s;ue. I &s;ometimes think of taking a hou&s;e in town, and providing a good governe&s;s, for I am convinced that &s;chool is not the place for them: It is impo&s;|&s;ible Mrs. &mdash; can attend to all; a hundred little things mu&s;t pa&s;s unnoticed; on the con|trary, a governe&s;s at home has nothing to do but to attend to them alone, and if &s;he is a &s;en&s;ible woman, &s;he will know how to cor|rect their faults, and at the &s;ame time en|gage their affections.</P>
</SP>
<P>Mr. Davenport approved this plan, but thought it a dangerous one to carry into exe|cution, as &s;o much depended upon their choice of the per&s;on. They talked a long while up|on this &s;ubject: at length, in con&s;equence of a propo&s;al made by Mr. Davenport, it was &s;ettled in the following manner: viz. as Mr. Davenport meant in future to &s;pend the fir&s;t part of every year in town, for the &s;ake of having proper ma&s;ters for his children, there could be no rea&s;on why Sophia and Amelia &s;hould not then leave &s;chool, and live entire|ly with them: by the&s;e means they would have proper attention paid to their educa|tion,
<PB N="95" REF="034505_0095_0FFE0A7F05DC2EE0">without running any hazard what&s;oever.</P>
<P>This &s;cheme was highly plea&s;ing to Mr. Ea&s;y, it rid him at once of all his anxiety, and he felt him&s;elf infinitely obliged to his bro|ther and &s;i&s;ter for this great proof of the &s;in|cerity of their friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>At dinner Sophia and Amelia &s;aid little. Mr. Davenport generally a&s;ked the former to drink a gla&s;s of wine with him, he omitted the compliment that day, but Sophia helped her&s;elf out of the decanter that &s;tood between her and her &s;i&s;ter, who immediately followed her example.</P>
<P>When Mrs. Davenport ro&s;e from table, George followed her out of the room, and a&s;ked leave to have the conclu&s;ion of the fai|ry tale read out before his cou&s;ins went away: his mama told him he might read it to them and his &s;i&s;ters that afternoon: he thanked her for this indulgence, and ran im|mediately to fetch the book. Having called his brother, and found out the place where they had left off, he began as follows:</P>
<P>She, (that is, Benevolenta,) &s;oon found out that Melpomene was in the palace of Horridona, a fairy, who made a common
<PB REF="034505_0096_0FFE0A39903E7280">practice of &s;tealing away children with the cruel de&s;ign of returning them to their pa|rents with perverted minds and unhappy tempers. With this view &s;he indulged them in every wi&s;h, whether innocent or wicked: &s;he threw all &s;orts of temptations in their way, and at the &s;ame time, by her example and advice, eradicated every good principle that might &s;erve to re&s;i&s;t them.</P>
<P>Benevolenta was &s;hocked to find this poor little prince&s;s in &s;o terrible a &s;ituation, and was re&s;olved to u&s;e all po&s;&s;ible means to re|lieve her. She immediately &s;ummoned the powerful genii Boccadindo, and intreated him to a&s;&s;i&s;t her. Boccadindo brought with him the little Fidelio: this amiable little creature had been brought up with the ten|dere&s;t care and attention by a fairy aunt. To a beautiful figure was added the mo&s;t en|gaging di&s;po&s;ition, and the mo&s;t benevolent heart. Hearing from the fairy the &s;ituation of the prince&s;s, he begged her to permit him to exert him&s;elf for her relief "Alas! my child," &s;aid Benevolenta, "her mind, I fear, is already perverted."</P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="034505_0097_0FFE0A81CF3F36A8">
"Let us hope not," &s;aid Boccadindo; <Q>&s;he mu&s;t not be lo&s;t; and if the power of example can be of any &s;ervice to her, &s;he cannot have a better pattern of goodne&s;s than Fidelio.</Q></P>
<P>Fidelio returned the genii thanks for the good opinion he entertained of him, and ki&s;&s;ing the fairy's hand, conjured her to em|ploy him in the undertaking.</P>
<P>Benevolenta expre&s;&s;ed the fears &s;he enter|tained for his own &s;afety, and promi&s;ed to yield to his intreaties, provided the genii would give him a tali&s;man &s;ufficiently pow|erful to repel any rude attacks, the evil coun|&s;els of Horridona might make upon the in|tegrity of his heart.</P>
<P>"Never fear, Madam," replied Boccadin|do, <Q>he has no need of tali&s;mans to pre&s;erve him free from guilt; &s;uch precautions are needle&s;s, his own heart, and the edu|cation he has received, are tali&s;mans of much greater power than any he can be furni&s;hed with.</Q></P>
<P>The fairy now no longer he&s;itated, &s;he gave her con&s;ent to the undertaking, and the
<PB N="98" REF="034505_0098_0FFE0A3E16892E28">genii pre&s;ented Fidelio with a &s;lipper, which, upon putting on his foot, would immediate|ly procure what money, clothes, &amp;c. he might want for his journey.</P>
<P>Fidelio was now tran&s;ported with joy: it had been foretold he would one time or other have it in his power to redeem a prin|ce&s;s from captivity, and by the force of his example to reclaim her from the paths of vice. His generous heart exulted at the idea that the time for the accompli&s;hment of the prophecy was come, and the eagerne&s;s he te&s;tified, proceeded purely from the de&s;ire of doing good, and not from any &s;elfi&s;h views with regard to his own intere&s;t.</P>
<P>Boccadindo now took his leave; Fidelio put on the enchanted &s;lipper, and imme|diately the ground opened beneath him, and a little white hor&s;e appeared, ready bridled and &s;adled. The young prince mounted him, and was pre&s;ently out of &s;ight.</P>
<P>In the mean time the king and queen of Ro&s;yland had i&s;&s;ued a proclamation, prom|i&s;ing honours and riches to that per&s;on who &s;hould bring the prince&s;s &s;afe to their arms. Many were induced to undertake this cau&s;e,

</FIGURE>
<PB N="100" REF="034505_0100_0FFE0A8497E02AD8">by the flattering pro&s;pects before them, but they all returned without any &s;ucce&s;s, not having patience enough to follow the adven|ture, as they were wholly unacquainted with the abode of Horridona.</P>
<P>Fidelio was equally ignorant of the &s;itua|tion of her palace, but by his uncea&s;ing ex|ertions, and unrelenting fortitude, &s;ucceeded at la&s;t in the di&s;covery. He travelled nine|teen days through unfrequented de&s;erts and dreary woods; on the 20th, ju&s;t before &s;un|&s;et, he found him&s;elf in a large plain, at the farther end of which he perceived the palace of Delights, as it was erroneou&s;ly &s;tiled by the owner. The walls were ebony, the porti|cos of &s;olid gold, the window frames and roof of the &s;ame metal. The we&s;tern &s;un &s;hone full upon it, and made it, when con|tra&s;ted with the dark gloom of &s;ome lofty pines that grew on each &s;ide, a mo&s;t beauti|ful object. Fidelio was delighted to behold the end of his journey, and immediately gal|loped towards it. Upon his arrival at the grand entrance, he di&s;mounted, and taking the &s;lipper from one of his &s;addle bags, care|fully depo&s;ited it in his bo&s;om, and telling
<PB N="101" REF="034505_0101_0FFE0AC573F139D8">his little hor&s;e he had no pre&s;ent u&s;e for him, it immediately di&s;appeared. He a&s;cended a flight of ebony &s;teps, with gold ballu&s;trades, and entered a lofty hall, &s;urrounded with a colonnade of ebony pillars, the ba&s;es and chapiters ornamented with gold, and wreaths of gold flowers twi&s;ted round the columns. The dome wore the appearance of the &s;tarry firmament on a fro&s;ty night. Oppo&s;ite the great door was an arch, which &s;erved as an entrance to the bottom of a grand &s;tairca&s;e of &s;olid gold, which led up to a long gallery of white marble, who&s;e walls were inlaid and the floor of different coloured marble; this opened into a &s;uite of apartments, who&s;e elegance was equal to their magnificence. He had already pa&s;&s;ed through twenty-nine rooms, every one varying from the other; he at length came into an octagon one of pea green marble, hung all round with large fe&s;toons of white and red ro&s;es, who&s;e frag|rancy perfumed the apartment&mdash;a &s;mall fountain of &s;cented water ro&s;e in the middle.
<PB N="102" REF="034505_0102_0FFE0A8763366398">There were &s;ix niches, in which were placed alaba&s;ter &s;tatues of exqui&s;ite workman&s;hip. On the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the room to that by which he had entered, was a green &s;ilk cur|tain; upon drawing this a&s;ide, he found him&s;elf in a portico of white marble, which commanded a view of the park and gardens belonging to this beautiful palace. On the north the pro&s;pect was bounded by moun|tains, who&s;e tops were covered with &s;now; the&s;e however, were at &s;o great a di&s;tance, and the intervening country &s;o beautiful, that, far from affording a dreary a&s;pect, they added new charms to the &s;cene. The palace &s;tood upon a lawn of the fine&s;t verdure, wa|tered by a wide river that meandered through the adjacent country, and at length emptied it&s;elf into the &s;ea, which terminated the view on the &s;outh. The flower garden, which was of great extent, was bounded by a colonnade of white marble; this was hollow and tran&s;|parent, &s;o that at night, lamps were lighted in the in&s;ide, and altogether it had a very plea&s;ing effect. A delightful concert was heard on the water, on which a number of boats were &s;ailing. A magnificent bridge
<PB N="103" REF="034505_0103_0FFE0AC8432B7A48">was thrown over it, and the whole pro&s;pect together was &s;o enchanting, that Fidelio for a moment forgot the prince&s;s, and &s;tood wrapt in a&s;toni&s;hment. Whil&s;t he was gaz|ing round with admiring eyes, he ob&s;erved a party of young men and women below, who were making &s;igns to him to come down: he immediately recollected him&s;elf, and ha&s;tened to join them. They paid him a thou&s;and compliments, and offered their &s;ervices in &s;hewing him the beauties of the place. He thanked them for their polite|ne&s;s, and told them he only wi&s;hed to be in|troduced to the fairy. "You may have that plea&s;ure," they replied, "in a few min|utes. She pre&s;ides at our table, and we are in momentary expectation of a &s;um|mons to attend her. You will be per|fectly charmed with her; the beauties of her per&s;on are only rivalled by the brill|iancy of her wit; and when once you have pa&s;&s;ed a few minutes with her, you will never have re&s;olution enough to quit her palace."</P>
<P>While they were yet &s;peaking, a band of martial mu&s;ic &s;truck up, immediately num|bers
<PB N="104" REF="034505_0104_0FFE0A8A33789AF0">of people i&s;&s;ued from all parts of the garden; tho&s;e who were on the water land|ed in great ha&s;te, and the whole multitude eagerly crowded towards a large building that had, till then, e&s;caped Fidelio's ob&s;erva|tion. Tho&s;e with whom he had been con|ver&s;ing joined the re&s;t, and by the force of others pu&s;hing forward, he at la&s;t entered an immen&s;e banquetting hou&s;e, lighted up with a profu&s;ion of lamps; it was, however, kept very cool, the windows being all open and &s;haded with green &s;ilk curtains. In the mid|dle was a table that could be enlarged or con|tracted at plea&s;ure, &s;o that of whatever num|ber the company con&s;i&s;ted, it always appear|ed full. The entertainment was magnificent; the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite viands were &s;erved in great abundance in ma&s;&s;y gold. The com|pany being all a&s;&s;embled, a large folding door was thrown open, and twenty beautiful young girls entered the hall, dancing to the &s;ound of the mu&s;ic above mentioned; they each of them held a large wreath of flowers, with which they formed a &s;ort of triumphal arch for the fairy to pa&s;s through. Soft mu&s;ic was now heard, and Horridona entered, her
<PB N="105" REF="034505_0105_0FFE0ACB0EA8CEC0">train born by a page, who&s;e dre&s;s entirely con&s;i&s;ted of precious &s;tones.</P>
<P>Fidelio was now pre&s;ented to the fairy, who a&s;ked him in an affable tone of voice, "What had led him to her palace?" Total|ly unu&s;ed to deceit, he found it difficult to conceal the true motive of his journey; but knowing how fatal &s;uch an avowal mu&s;t prove to the &s;ucce&s;s of his cau&s;e, he replied with he&s;itation, that it was "curio&s;ity." Horridona expecting him to have launched out in prai&s;e of the edifice and its owner, was not a little di&s;appointed at his an&s;wer. She &s;miled at his confu&s;ion, and turning to his companions, "You mu&s;t in&s;pire this young man," &s;aid &s;he "with a little more courage; our magnificence confounds him; he will like us better when he knows more of us; in the mean time you mu&s;t give him confi|dence; he is by far too ba&s;hful." To &s;ay the truth, Fidelio hung down his head, and look|ed to great di&s;advantage, but he had &s;ufficient cau&s;e to be di&s;concerted. The fairy appeared to him the mo&s;t hideous figure he had ever be|held: independent of the frightfulne&s;s of her per|&s;on, it required but a &s;mall degree of phy&s;iogno|my
<PB N="106" REF="034505_0106_0FFE0A8D015ED098">to di&s;cover in her face that her mind was equally horrible. But now &s;he gave the &s;ig|nal for the commencement of fe&s;tivity. Fi|delio &s;uffered him&s;elf to be led to the table; but although the greate&s;t dainties were offer|ed him by his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ompanions, he could not be prevailed upon to ca&s;te a &s;ingle mor&s;el. His fright had taken away his appetite; he &s;till continued to hang his head, now and then &s;tealing a look at tho&s;e who &s;at next him, many of whom he &s;hortly perceived were en|tertaining them&s;elves with ridiculing his con|fu&s;ed air. Melpomene in&s;tantly ru&s;hed into his mind; he quickly recovered him&s;elf, and ca&s;ting a look of eager inquiry all around him, endeavoured, but in vain, to &s;ee the prince&s;s. His prudence now &s;ugge&s;ted to him, that the only way to get intelligence of her, was to recom|mend him&s;elf to the per&s;on in who&s;e power &s;he was, by conforming in &s;ome degree to the manners of her court.</P>
<P>Clovis and Lydia, who &s;at on each &s;ide of him, congratulated him on the return of his &s;pirits. Young and giddy they had no idea of plea&s;ure exi&s;ting any where but in Horridona's palace. It is true, when fir&s;t
<PB N="107" REF="034505_0107_0FFE0ACDD7394830">they were introduced to her, they were, like Fidelio, &s;tartled at her figure; but as they were then but children, and their principles unfixed, they were &s;oon reconciled to her ap|pearance, and being deceived by the fal&s;e glare of happine&s;s that &s;hone in the fea&s;ts and balls with which &s;he daily entertained them, this horror gradually wore off, and they now con&s;idered her in the &s;ame light as they had de&s;cribed her to Fidelio.</P>
<P>This young prince, no longer embarra&s;&s;ed, gave attention to all that was pa&s;&s;ing. The conver&s;ation (interrupted by loud bur&s;ts of laughter) was &s;uch as I am pur&s;uaded would afford no amu&s;ement to my readers, were it to be repeated. Fidelio could join but little in it: he was even &s;ometimes almo&s;t tempted to &s;top his ears.</P>
<P>The meats being removed, a magnificent de&s;ert, with the mo&s;t curious wines, was plac|ed on the table. In the middle was a tem|ple made of little diamond men and women, carrying ba&s;kets of &s;weetmeats; they march|ed up to the top of the table, knelt to the queen, and then dividing into two parties,
<PB N="108" REF="034505_0108_0FFE0A8FEB59B7A0">pre&s;ented each of the company with a ba&s;ket; meeting at the bottom, they joined hands, and danced back to the temple to the &s;ound of a harp, which was played by a diamond boy &s;itting on the dome of the temple. None of the figures in this curious piece of mechan|i&s;m were more than &s;even inches high. It was near midnight when they quitted the banquetting-room: intoxicated with the li|quors they had been drinking, they reeled after the queen into a large myrtle bower, where they were each pre&s;ented with a goblet filled from a fountain who&s;e water had the proper|ty of recovering tho&s;e who drank it from the effects of intemperance. Here the party &s;epa|rated; &s;ome returned to the palace, and &s;pent the remainder of the night in gaming, others again &s;at down to drink; dances were made in different parts of the gardens, but they were conducted without the lea&s;t deco|rum, and all was riot and confu&s;ion. In the mean time Fidelio, who had left the table at an early hour, had made a di&s;covery that gave him no little joy. Fatigued with the noi&s;e and non&s;en&s;e that prevailed among the com|pany in the hall, he &s;tole away unperceived,
<PB N="109" REF="034505_0109_0FFE0AD09FC842D0">and going into the park which was already il|luminated, rambled about for &s;ome time: at la&s;t he cro&s;&s;ed the river, and directed his cour&s;e towards the wood that fronted the pal|ace. Here he was preparing to re&s;t him&s;elf from the fatigues he had lately undergone, when the voices of &s;ome children caught his ear; he immediately ha&s;tened towards the place from whence they &s;eemed to proceed. He perceived a &s;mall palace of white marble: the portico was lighted up, and the doors being open he entered a hall, where a number of beautiful children were running and jumping about.</P>
<P>Upon &s;eeing Fidelio, they immediately &s;ur|rounded him, and began pulling off the dia|mond fringe with which his mantle was trim|med, others ran away with his &s;word-knot and &s;hoe-ro&s;es; but as there was not finery enough for them all, what little there was, quickly be|came an object of contention. Words were &s;oon &s;ucceeded by blows, and all the mea&s;ures Fidelie took to pacify them were of no effect. Amid&s;t the confu&s;ion of voices, he frequently heard the name of Melpomene pronounced: he &s;oon di&s;covered her to be one of the fore|mo&s;t in the battle. Her little face was di&s;tort|ed with fury, the &s;towers which had ornament|ed
<PB N="110" REF="034505_0110_0FFE0A92B3560378">her dre&s;s, were torn to pieces; roaring and &s;tamping with vehemence, &s;he pleaded her birth as a di&s;tinction that entitled her to the jewels.</P>
<P>The uproar &s;till increa&s;ing, at la&s;t brought &s;ome of their nur&s;es, who, upon &s;eeing the manner in which they were engaged, ran back and immediately returned with a quantity of toys and &s;weetmeats to quiet them. Our young prince now &s;tept forward, and apologi&s;ed for the trouble he had occa&s;ioned. They replied, <Q>it was a pity he had come at all, the children were all of the &s;weete&s;t di&s;po&s;itions in the world, and he was highly blameable in not providing him&s;elf with jewels enough for them all.</Q> It was in vain that Fidelio urged as an excu&s;e, his accidentally coming near the place; they would not li&s;ten to him, and it was not without a great deal of grumbling, and upon con|dition that he brought &s;omething for the chil|dren, that they gave him permi&s;&s;ion to call again.</P>
<P>"Fortunate Fidelio!" &s;aid the young fairy to him&s;elf as he retired from the wood, <Q>you have found the object of your &s;earch.</Q> But this joy was of &s;hort continuance; for when he reflected on the &s;ituation of the unfortunate Melpomene, the pro&s;pect of her deliverance appeared to him at a greater di&s;tance than ever. "Alas!" exclaimed the almo&s;t de&s;perate Fid|elio,
<PB N="111" REF="034505_0111_0FFE0AD38BDCAEA0"><Q>of what pre&s;umption have I not been guilty, in offering my &s;ervice to the queen of Ro&s;yland, towards the recovery of her daugh|ter! Were &s;he in&s;tantly removed to the palace of ALMANZOROASTER, and placed under the guidance and protection of the be&s;t and the mo&s;t powerful of the genii, even there it would require the labour of years to eradicate from her bo&s;om tho&s;e &s;eeds of vice which Horridona has plentifully &s;own, and diligently cultivated. And &s;hall I, who am my&s;elf a child, pretend to combat and to overcome ob&s;tacles which would impede the progre&s;s of Almanzoroa&s;ter, and that too in the habitation of Horridona, in the mid&s;t of dangerous in&s;tructions, and equally danger|ous examples? Can my weak eloquence per|&s;uade her to virtue, when every other hand pre&s;ents a new allurement to plea&s;ure, and every other tongue a fre&s;h incitement to vice? Detained by the united powers of &s;in, folly, and Horridona, what pre&s;umption mu&s;t it be in a child to pretend to break her chains? No, the freedom of Melpomene mu&s;t be effected by a &s;tronger arm than that of the inexperienced Fidelio. And yet,</Q> af|ter a moments recollection within him&s;elf, <Q>with what face can I meet the fairy Benevo|lenta,
<PB N="112" REF="034505_0112_0FFE0A9580CFBBB0">and tell her that I had entered the Pal|ace of Plea&s;ure, but had returned without Melpomene? That I had di&s;covered the prin|ce&s;s, but had not the courage, the genero&s;ity to attempt her deliverance? How can I tell her that I am a coward, unworthy of her confidence, and the good opinion of the genii Boceadindo! It mu&s;t not be; the prophecy <HI>&s;hall</HI> be fulfilled. I &s;wear by the enchanted wand of the mighty Almanzoroa&s;ter, that I will not relinqui&s;h the palace of Horridona till the deliverance is effected by nature or Fidelio.</Q></P>
<P>George was here interrupted by the arrival of &s;ome company to tea, which unluckily prevent|ed the conclu&s;ion of the fairy tale from being read that evening. I &s;ay unluckily, as the book then di&s;appeared, and though &s;earched for the next day in every corner of the hou&s;e, was no where to be found. Many were the conject|ures formed upon this occa&s;ion by the little Dave ports: their mama could ea&s;ily have &s;et them right, as &s;he was privy to the affair.</P>
<P>She had &s;een Sophia &s;teal behind George's chair, and (as &s;he thought unob&s;erved) &s;natch up the book and put it in her pocket. When inquiries after it were made the next day by the children, this good lady was &s;urpri&s;ed to
<PB N="113" REF="034505_0113_0FFE0AD794B9F438">&s;ee with what <HI>&s;ang-froid</HI> Sophia per&s;i&s;ted in de|nying any knowledge of the tran&s;action. Shocked to the la&s;t degree, &s;he forbad any thing farther being &s;aid on the &s;ubject, and di|verted their attention by the introduction of another book, equally entertaining and more in&s;tructive. Mrs. Davenport was unwilling to pain her brother by the knowledge of his daughter's behaviour, and therefore declined taking any notice of it at that time; but no &s;ooner did &s;he retire to her own dre&s;&s;ing room, than &s;he wrote a letter to her governe&s;s, in which &s;he intreated her in the &s;tronge&s;t terms to watch over her pupil during the time &s;he was to remain in Q&mdash;S&mdash;e, and to do her utmo&s;t to eradicate the hateful vice &s;he had contracted.</P>
<P>This letter produced much mortification to Sophia, after her return to &s;chool; for Mrs. S. affi&s;ted by the hint &s;he had received, convicted her in many untruths, for all of which &s;he was puni&s;hed with the greate&s;t &s;everity.</P>
<P>The following day, as the young people were &s;itting together after breakfa&s;t, Harry Lively came in, and informed the Mi&s;s Ea&s;ys, that he was going to ride with his papa to the next town, and that knowing they were to &s;et off the next morning for &s;chool, he came to
<PB N="114" REF="034505_0114_0FFE0A984A7E9D70">inquire if he could execute any commi&s;&s;ions for them. "O yes," &s;aid Sophia, "I want a hundred things, but I &s;uppo&s;e there is no get|ting them in this na&s;ty York&s;hire."&mdash;"Why not, cou&s;ins?" &s;aid Charles; "I wi&s;h you had told me what you wanted, and I think I could have contrived to have got them &s;ome way or other. You may get any thing at York."&mdash;"Yes, indeed fifty miles off; you are none of you &s;o kind as to &s;end &s;o far for any body but your&s;elves."&mdash;"Yes," &s;aid Charles, <Q>they could have come very well with papa's books the other day; but I dare &s;ay, if you will write down what you want, Har|ry will get them for you if they are to be had in the town of&mdash;.</Q></P>
<P>Sophia now taking out her pencil, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Amelia, wrote a long lift of articles, which they de&s;ired Harry Lively not to &s;how to any body, nor would they permit him to read it out.&mdash;"But," &s;aid the poor boy (whil&s;t they were cramming the paper into his wai&s;t|coat pocket,) "I don't know at what &s;hops the&s;e things are &s;old."&mdash;"Poh," cried Sophia, <Q>can't you remember when I tell you, the three fir&s;t are to be had at the haberda&s;hers, the two next at the grocers, the two that come afterwards at the toy &s;hop, the three next at the &s;tationers, and the five la&s;t at the

There, that's all, now go, my dear; make ha&s;te, I dare &s;ay your papa is waiting; but do you hear, you need not go &s;ending all the&s;e things here to-night&mdash;that will be quite fooli&s;h of you&mdash;I &s;hould not wi&s;h to have them before to-morrow; &s;o you need not put your&s;elf out of the way by call|ing here in your way back.

<P>"I'll let you know," replied Harry.&mdash; <Q>No, no, not for the world&mdash;no, I don't want to hear&mdash;if you get them, why, then you'll &s;end them to-morrow, if not, it can't be help't.</Q></P>
<P>A &s;ervant now informed Ma&s;ter Lively, that his papa had called for him, upon which Harry took his leave, not very well plea&s;ed with the &s;ucce&s;s of his vi&s;it; for though his meaning was &s;incere, when he offered his &s;ervices, he had no idea of receiving &s;uch a multiplicity of commi&s;|&s;ions.</P>

<P>"The Copernican &s;y&s;tem con&s;i&s;ts of the &s;un, &s;even primary, twelve &s;econdary planets, and the comets. The &s;even planets, Mercury, Ve|nus, the Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, and the Georgium Sidus, move round the &s;un in orbits, included one within the other, and in the order here u&s;ed in mentioning their names; Mercury being that which is neare&s;t the &s;un. The&s;e &s;even, which revolve round the &s;un as their center, are called primary planets: the
<PB N="119" REF="034505_0119_0FFE0ADEADB6BA70">twelve &s;mall planets revolve round the primary ones as their center, and are at the &s;ame time carried round the &s;un with them; they are there|fore called &s;econdary planets, moons, or &s;atel|lites. The Georgium Sidus is attended by two moons, Saturn by five, Jupiter by four, and the Earth by one. All of the&s;e, except the la&s;t, are invi&s;ible to our naked eye, on account of the &s;mallne&s;s of their &s;ize, and the greatne&s;s of their di&s;tance from us."</P>

<P>Why! becau&s;e the &s;un in the mid|dle of the planetariums is always made of <HI>cop|per,</HI> not of bra&s;s, as Mr. Charles told us.</P>
<P>This new proof of Amelia's &s;elf-conceit and ignorance was &s;o perfectly ridiculous, that the little Davenports could not refrain from laugh|ter. Amelia was highly affronted, and, in an angry tone of voice, in&s;i&s;ted on knowing what was the occa&s;ion of their merriment. Mary apologized for her rudene&s;s, but owned that it was impo&s;&s;ible to help it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Charles.</SPEAKER>
<P>To be &s;ure, it was rude to laugh, but you made &s;uch a droll mi&s;take! I wonder you &s;hould be ignorant that it was &s;o called from Copernicus, a Dane, who lived, if I am not mi&s;taken, in the fifteenth century. The
<PB N="120" REF="034505_0120_0FFE0AA1F190F318">ancients believed that the &s;un was the center of the &s;y&s;tem; but Ptolemy, an Egyptian philo&s;|opher, treated this notion as a fal&s;e one, and &s;uppo&s;ed the earth as the center, and the &s;un and planets de&s;cribing their orbits round it. But this opinion was totally rejected by Coper|nicus, who revived the old &s;y&s;tem, and e&s;tab|li&s;hed it upon firm and indi&s;putable proofs.</P>
</SP>
<P>The conver&s;ation now turned upon another &s;ubject, and they remained without any more di&s;putes till they went up to dre&s;s for dinner. Mrs. Davenport was far from wi&s;hing her chil|dren to give up much of their time to the orna|ment of their per&s;ons, but the always in&s;i&s;ted upon their being very clean and neat. Mary and Caroline had the care of their own clothes, and their mama looked them over from time to time, to &s;ee that they kept them in proper order.</P>
<P>As they were &s;itting at table, during dinner, one of the &s;ervants delivered a note to Sophia, which, upon opening, &s;he found was from Harry Lively; &s;he immediately gue&s;&s;ed the contents, and colouring, crumpled it up, and put it in her pocket.

<P>The contents of the paper that was inclo&s;ed greatly vexed and &s;urpri&s;ed Mr. Ea&s;y: it con|tained a pack of unintelligible names, all calcu|lated to rai&s;e a laugh again&s;t poor Harry.</P>
<P>Mr. Ea&s;y &s;everely reprimanded his daughters for this piece of mi&s;chief: it was a proof, he &s;aid, both of their ingratitude and ill-breeding; he was now convinced that their di&s;po&s;itions would not bear indulgence, and that, for the future, they mu&s;t expect none from him, as he was determined to try what effect &s;everity would have upon them. He accordingly de|&s;ired them to go up into their own apartment immediately, and upon no account, to make their appearance till the hor&s;es were ready the following morning. Sophia and her &s;i&s;ter ne|ver &s;aw their father &s;o angry before; they had no excu&s;e to make for their behaviour, and not wi&s;hing to be farther expo&s;ed before their cou|&s;ins, they in&s;tantly obeyed his commands. Up|&s;tairs they found Ann packing up their clothes; the planetarium lay upon the table, and &s;he was ju&s;t going to put it in their trunk, when So|phia &s;natching it from her, threw it to the other end of the room. "What a fool you
<PB N="124" REF="034505_0124_0FFE0AA6587A9A00">are to let it lie there," &s;aid Amelia. "Mrs. Set|to-rights," meaning Mrs. Davenport, "will &s;py it out, and make mi&s;chief of it; you had better put it out of the window at once."</P>
<P>"A good thought! returned Sophia, open the window, and out it &s;hall go! plannatum, or foolatum, or whatever it is called."</P>
<P>While this &s;cene was pa&s;&s;ing above, Mr. Ea&s;y was lamenting the nece&s;&s;ity there was of treat|ing his daughters with the utmo&s;t rigour: he <HI>had</HI> hoped to have made companions and friends of them very early in life, but they had, by their late behaviour, de&s;troyed his hopes, and he looked forward to nothing but oppo&s;ition to the plans he had formed.</P>
<P>Amelia and Sophia, contrary to their fa|ther's expectation, were punctual to the time appointed for their departure. They were very &s;ulky all breakfa&s;t time; and when they heard that the hor&s;es were put to, ro&s;e up with an eagerne&s;s by no means con&s;i&s;tent either with gratitude or common politene&s;s, as it plainly evinced their impatience to leave tho&s;e rela|tions who had &s;hewed &s;o much true kindne&s;s to|wards them. Mrs. Davenport de&s;ired they would write to her as &s;oon as they had reached Q&mdash;S&mdash;e, that &s;he might know if they had got &s;afe to the end of their journey. They

They jumped into the chai&s;e, hardly taking any leave of their cou&s;ins, who &s;tood amazed at their be|haviour. Mr. Ea&s;y promi&s;ed to return in a few days, and tenderly embracing his &s;i&s;ter and nieces, followed his unpromi&s;ing daughters into the carriage, which drove away immedately.</P>
<P>Mr. Davenport and his &s;ons mounted their hor&s;es at the &s;ame time, meaning to accompany them for a few miles.</P>
<P>When they were all out of &s;ight, Mrs. Daven|port, who had been watching them down the avenue, turned to Mary and Caroline, and ki&s;&s;ing them, &s;aid, "my dear little girls will, I hope, make a proper u&s;e of the &s;cenes they have been witne&s;&s;es to, and carefully avoid the many errors which their cou&s;ins, for want of proper advice, have fallen into."</P>
<P>Mary and Caroline promi&s;ed their mama they would be more attentive than ever to the advice &s;he was &s;o kind as to give them from time to time, and Mary expre&s;&s;ed her happi|ne&s;s at the pro&s;pect there was of her cou&s;ins amendment, when they &s;hould all live toge|ther, as Mrs. Davenport could then pay the &s;ame attention to their morals, as &s;he had done to tho&s;e of her own children.</P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="034505_0127_0FFDC679A5F77B80">
"At pre&s;ent, my dears, "&s;aid Mrs. Daven|port," they &s;eem but little inclined to li&s;ten to any thing for their good. I have endeavoured to be of u&s;e to them, but all to no purpo&s;e: yet I cannot bring my&s;elf to think that their hearts are bad: I rather wi&s;h to &s;uppo&s;e the impropriety of their behaviour proceeds from a childi&s;h heedle&s;&s;ne&s;s that has grown to an a|larming height, by keeping company with girls more fooli&s;h than them&s;elves. However, when we all live together, I &s;hall labour with|out cea&s;ing to correct their faults, and hope one day or other to make them worthy of their father's affection."</P>
<P>Mrs. Davenport then de&s;ired her daughters to put on their hats, and come with her into the grounds. They pa&s;&s;ed through that part of the garden directly under the windows of the bed-room which the Mi&s;s Ea&s;ys had occupied. Caroline perceived &s;omething laying on the gra&s;s, and running to &s;ee what it was, felt mor|tified and &s;urpri&s;ed to find the little planeta|rium entirely &s;poilt. She picked it up, and with tears in her eyes, "&s;ee, mama," &s;aid &s;he, "what the&s;e ill-natured girls have done. My brothers were &s;o happy whil&s;t they were mak|ing it for them, and now &s;ee what it is come to!"&mdash;"Poor Charles," &s;aid Mary, "how &s;or|ry he and his brother will be!"&mdash;"This is
<PB N="128" REF="034505_0128_0FFE0AAD2F087F30">of a piece," replied Mrs. Davenport, "with their behaviour to Harry Lively; this almo&s;t makes me de&s;pair of their amendment. I look upon ingratitude as a great crime, and when carried to this height, it fills me with ap|prehen&s;ion for their future conduct. But do not let your brothers &s;ee this, as I know it will give them pain, and their good nature de&s;erves a better return."&mdash;"I'll take it into my own room, directly, mama," returned Caroline; "to be &s;ure it is now of no u&s;e, but yet it would be a pity to throw it away, &s;o I'll keep it for my brothers' &s;ake, and whenever I look on it, I &s;hall think of their good nature, and remem|ber how ungrateful my cou&s;ins were about it."&mdash;"I would wi&s;h you, my dear girl," &s;aid her mama, "to make u&s;e of every circum&s;tance that may &s;trenghten your affection for Charles and George, but I &s;hould rather wi&s;h you to throw the planetarium away, than that it &s;hould &s;erve to remind you of any unfavourable opinions you may have formed of your cou&s;ins."</P>
<P>"Why, mama," &s;aid Caroline, "to tell you the truth, I was very glad to &s;ee my cou&s;ins at fir&s;t, and I expected to pa&s;s many happy days with them; but they turned out to be &s;uch ill natured girls, and &s;o different from what I and my &s;i&s;ter wi&s;hed them to be, that I really don't care if I never &s;ee them again."</P>

<P>He is &s;o infirm, that every change affects him.</P>
</SP>
<P>They now entered the hou&s;e, and the two little girls went to their &s;tudies.</P>
<P>About the u&s;ual dinner time, a &s;ervant arriv|ed, &s;ent by Mr. Davenport, to let his family
<PB N="132" REF="034505_0132_0FFE0AB1A1D2D040">know he &s;hould not return that night, as old Jo&s;eph was at the point of death, and he could not leave him in that &s;tate. George and Charles likewi&s;e remained at the cottage. Up|on making &s;ome inquiries, Mrs. Davenport found that when her brother &s;topped there in his way to town, Jo&s;eph was very ill, and as he was to pa&s;s through the town where the phy&s;ician lived, he immediately went forward with all diligence, and meant to continue his journey with the &s;ame &s;peed, that he might re|turn as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible to his old friend. The &s;ervant added, the phy&s;ician had &s;ince arrived, and found his patient in a wor&s;e &s;tate than either his ma&s;ter or Mr. Ea&s;y had &s;u&s;pected him to be; in &s;hort, he had declared it to be impo&s;|&s;ible he &s;hould &s;urvive that night.</P>
<P>Mrs. Davenport and her two little girls were &s;en&s;ibly affected with this news: they had no appetite for their dinner, and though they &s;at at table, hardly eat any thing.</P>
<P>There was a large medicine che&s;t in the hou&s;ekeeper's-room, the phy&s;ician was acquaint|ed with its contents, and had de&s;ired a few of the articles to be &s;ent to him at old Jo&s;eph's cot|tage. Mrs. Davenport likewi&s;e &s;ent her hu&s;|band a large wrapping gown, and a great coat to each of her &s;ons, as it was very cold weath|er to &s;it up all night. In the cour&s;e of the
<PB N="133" REF="034505_0133_0FFE0AF231028A10">night old Jo&s;eph breathed his la&s;t. Upon Mr. Ea&s;y's return, he &s;ettled a &s;mall annuity upon the widow and her grand-daughter, and Mr. Davenport placed them in a &s;mall cottage with|in his domains. The Mid&s;ummer holidays Mi&s;s Ea&s;ys &s;pent at &s;chool; Mrs. Davenport's reque&s;t of a letter from them was never com|plied with, a circum&s;tance which gave her no little pain.</P>
<P>Much as &s;he wi&s;hed'to produce a reformation in the&s;e wayward girls, yet &s;he could not help anticipating a little of the anxiety which would attend the execution of her plan; the&s;e reflec|tions would &s;ometimes throw a damp over that mild cheerfulne&s;s for which &s;he was &s;o much admired. But now the time arrived for their long-projected journey, the hou&s;e was al|ready taken in Berkley Square; &s;ome of the &s;ervants were on their way to town, and the day was fixed for the departure of the remain|der of the family. Upon their arrival in town, they &s;ent to inform Mrs. S. the governe&s;s.</P>
<P>Sophia and Amelia, who were not acquaint|ed with Mr. Davenport's intention of pa&s;&s;ing a few months of the winter in town, were not a little &s;urpri&s;ed at the &s;ummons to leave &s;chool. Mrs. Davenport received them with that affec|tion which, though &s;o ill merited on their part,
<PB N="134" REF="034505_0134_0FFE0AB46E0BF6C0">&s;he could not withhold from the children of a brother &s;he &s;o tenderly loved.</P>
<P>Mr. Ea&s;y &s;eldom re&s;ided any length of time together in London, when he did, he had lodg|ings in St. James's &s;treet, but as his brother was now in town, apartments were prepared for him in Berkley &s;quare.</P>
<P>Mrs. Devenport's arrival in town was &s;oon known by her numerous acquaintance, who were all eager to pay their re&s;pect to her; her time was &s;o fully employed in receiving and paying vi&s;its, that &s;he found her&s;elf totally una|ble to pur&s;ue her u&s;ual dome&s;tic employments. She therefore intimated to them, that as &s;he came to London &s;olely for the purpo&s;e of pro|curing ma&s;ters for her children, it was not her intention to launch out into all the di&s;&s;ipations of a gay life. The&s;e hints had a de&s;ired effect, and Mrs. Davenport &s;oon began to find her ac|cu&s;tomed plea&s;ure in in&s;pecting the education of her children. She had engaged a governe&s;s for them, and had taken no &s;mall pains and trouble to procure one in whom &s;he could con|fide.</P>
<P>This was a mortifying &s;troke to Sophia and Amelia; they had at fir&s;t thought their aunt meant to take the care of their education en|tirely upon her&s;elf, without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a governe&s;s. This idea had given them much
<PB N="135" REF="034505_0135_0FFE0AF3C3343C78">plea&s;ure, as they concluded that in London &s;he would find but little time to attend to them.</P>
<P>But how were they undeceived when Mrs. Davenport told them &s;he had engaged Mrs. El|win to be always with them, and to &s;uperin|tend their le&s;&s;ons when &s;he was forced to ab&s;ent her&s;elf from home. Still, however, they were not without hope, this governe&s;s might prove more ignorant than them&s;elves, or if this were not the ca&s;e, perhaps they &s;hould be able to im|po&s;e upon her, coax her into compliance with their idle fits, or el&s;e lead her &s;uch a life as would induce her to leave the &s;ituation. But when this lady came, before &s;he had been one week in the hou&s;e, they found that none of the&s;e &s;chemes were likely to &s;ucceed.</P>
<P>Mrs. Elwin proved to be a per&s;on every way qualified for the charge &s;he had undertaken. Having had much experience in the education of young people, &s;he had acquirrd a degree of penetration that enabled her to di&s;cover the &s;ource of all their actions; and as &s;he never &s;uffered a bad trait to pa&s;s unnoticed, Sophia and Amelia, notwith&s;tanding the plans they had concerted together, began to find it nece&s;&s;ary to attend a little to their behaviour.</P>
<P>Their &s;chool began in the morning at &s;even; eight was their breakfa&s;t hour; from that time till ten, the mu&s;ic ma&s;ter attended Sophia and
<PB N="136" REF="034505_0136_0FFE0AB88073EBC8">Amelia on Mondays, Wedne&s;days and Fridays; Mary and Caroline on the intervening days; on Tue&s;days, Thur&s;days, and Saturdays, whil&s;t their cou&s;ins were employed with their mu&s;ic ma&s;ter, Sophia and Amelia took le&s;&s;ons in drawing.</P>
<P>Mrs. Davenport joined them at ten, when Mrs. Elwin a&s;&s;i&s;ted her in in&s;tructing them in hi&s;tory and geography. At one, the carriage was always ready to &s;et them down in Hyde Park, or if the ground was very damp, to take them airing. At three they returned home to practi&s;e on the harp&s;ichord, and dre&s;s for din|ner, which was &s;erved at four o'clock to Mrs. Elwin and her four pupils. After dinner they read French and Italian, and learnt to dance. At eight they left their governe&s;s, and went to drink tea with the re&s;t of the family with whom they &s;taid till ten, when (after prayers) they went to bed.</P>
<P>Sophia and Amelia were by no means plea&s;|ed with this arrangement of their time; it re|quired too much application to &s;tudy to meet with their approbation, and the opinion they entertained of their new governe&s;s, may be gathered from the following anecdote:</P>
<P>When this lady had been with them about a fortnight, Mrs. Davenport went out of town for a few days; it was during her ab&s;ence that Caro|line
<PB N="137" REF="034505_0137_0FFE0AF913A1C1C0">was one night kept awake by a violent tooth-ache. Upon examining her mouth, Mrs. Elwin found it nece&s;&s;ary to have immediate re|cour&s;e to a denti&s;t; &s;he accordingly ordered the carriage, leaving Mary and the two Mi&s;s Ea&s;ys &s;ome French hi&s;tory to get by heart. In about two hours &s;he returned with Caroline in high &s;pirits, having, upon the lo&s;s of her tooth, found her&s;elf entirely freed from pain. Mary immediately &s;aid her le&s;&s;on perfectly, but her cou&s;ins had only learnt a few lines, and tho&s;e very imperfectly.</P>
<P>Upon inquiry, Mrs. Elwin found that they had been out of the &s;chool-room mo&s;t of the time &s;he was ab&s;ent, and as this was &s;trictly forbid|den, &s;he thought it requi&s;ite to know what they had been about. Ob&s;erving ink upon Sophia's fingers, &s;he knew they mu&s;t have been writing, and in order to di&s;cover what, and to whom, &s;he que&s;tioned them very clo&s;ely; but they both affirmed they had not had a pen in their 05 hands. At this moment one of the hou&s;emaids entered the room with a letter in her hand, which &s;he gave to Sophia, &s;aying at the &s;ame time, "John &s;ays, Ma'am, that the man at the po&s;t-office &s;ays that the letter is above weight, and John wants to know if he is to pay for it."</P>
<P>Mrs. Elwin told the maid &s;he need not wait,

<PB N="139" REF="034505_0139_0FFE0AFA99BE8F98">and taking the paper from Sophia, broke it open: it was addre&s;&s;ed to a young lady who had been her great friend at &s;chool, and con|tained the following lines:</P>

But this does not la&s;t long, for we have little to learn by heart, but a good deal of <HI>de&s;k-work</HI> (as you call it) &s;uch as making extracts from hi&s;tory, copying maps, writing down the lati|tude and longitude of places I never heard of before, and never wi&s;h to do again; then we tran&s;late French and Italian, and the duce knows what all. By the bye, I return you your
<PB N="141" REF="034505_0141_0FFE0AFC2255E2F0">paper of riddles, for I do believe riddles would be a prophanation in this hou&s;e, where we are all &s;o mighty learned. Would you believe it, I had a half an hour's lecture for tying up my garters the other day while we were kneeling at prayers in the &s;chool-room? For my part I thought it a mighty good opportunity, but our good governe&s;s thought otherwi&s;e, and talk|ed &s;o much about what my <HI>duty</HI> was, and how much I ought at tho&s;e times to think of what I was about, that &s;he po&s;itively made me &s;ick.</P>
<P>"Amelia de&s;ires me to tell you to give the inclo&s;ed letter to her croney, Lady Su&s;an T&mdash;, when you &s;ee her, and de&s;ire her not to an|&s;wer it.</P>
<P>I wi&s;h I were in your ca&s;e; you have left &s;chool, and are to <HI>come out</HI> next year; as for me, 'tis true I am younger, but I don't &s;ee why I am not to <HI>come out</HI> at &s;ixteen as well as you; in&s;tead of that, I am to be immured up with the&s;e na&s;ty Davenports till nineteen, when I promi&s;e you I will play &s;ine pranks in &s;pite of pa&s;t lectures. Did you ever &s;ee dumb-bells? They are great lumps of lead inclo&s;ed in leath|er, which we poor nuns are made to hold in our hands, and &s;wing backwards and forwards, to open the che&s;t, as they &s;ay; and this &s;lavi&s;h

</LETTER>
<P>The letter inclo&s;ed in the above was much in the &s;ame &s;train. Mrs. Elwin read them over cooly. The &s;arca&s;ms thrown out again&s;t her gave her much le&s;s pain than the principles from which they proceeded. When &s;he had fini&s;hed the peru&s;al of them, &s;he lei&s;urely folded them up, and put them in her pocket, de&s;iring Sophia and Amelia to fini&s;h their le&s;&s;ons, and forbidding Mary or Caroline to hold any con|ver&s;ation with their cou&s;ins till Mrs. Davenport returned, to whom &s;he intended to refer the matter. Sophia and Amelia looked mighty &s;illy upon this di&s;covery being made of their &s;enti|ments, and &s;till more &s;o, when their aunt came
<PB N="143" REF="034505_0143_0FFE0B0031EFE7B0">home the next day. As they had committed an unpardonable fault in writing letters unknown to Mrs. Elwin, this affair was not to be pa&s;&s;ed over with &s;light admonition; e&s;pecially as Mrs. Davenport had long ob&s;erved that their di&s;po|&s;itions could be wrought on more by &s;everity than gentle means.</P>
<P>They were accordingly &s;entenced to be &s;hut up for a fortnight in &s;eparate rooms, in all which time they were only to be &s;een or &s;poken to by their governe&s;s: nor were they to be idle during this confinement; they read to Mrs. Elwin, and had &s;uch extracts to get by heart, as were calculated to convince them of the im|propriety of their conduct.</P>
<P>Upon the expiration of a fortnight, their annt gave each of them a letter, in an&s;wer to the two that had been intercepted. In the&s;e epi&s;tles (written by Mr. Davenport) arguments were offered that tended to &s;how the ingratitude and folly of turning into ridicule methods taken for our improvement by tho&s;e who are kind en|ough to intere&s;t them&s;elves in our welfare.</P>
<P>Sophia and Amelia were much &s;truck with the&s;e arguments, and I feel peculiar &s;atisfac|tion in a&s;&s;uring my readers their relations had never again any great cau&s;e to be di&s;plea&s;ed
<PB N="144" REF="034505_0144_0FFE0AC276177538">with them. They were not incorrigible, their hearts were at the bottom good, and the happi|ne&s;s of eradicating tho&s;e weeds that had &s;o long choaked up their nobler &s;entiments, fell to the lot of Mrs. Davenport, who well de&s;erved this reward for her care and attention.</P>
