<HEAD>Prelude.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN we &s;peculate on the va&s;t productions of literary pens, we are apt to &s;uppo&s;e that every &s;ub|ject is di&s;cu&s;&s;ed; but we find genius every day expanding, and &s;omething new and intere&s;ting pre&s;ent it&s;elf to view. From philo&s;ophical to &s;enti|mental writers the ob&s;ervation may be equally applied. This, perhaps, may be deemed only a trivial rea&s;on for the publication of the following Letters, the de&s;ign of which is to convey in&s;truction with amu&s;ement.</P>
<P>It may be objected, that there are already a variety of this de&s;cription in circulation. It is true there are;
<PB N="iv" REF="030397_0003_0FE6C585C228D370">but are there not many philo&s;ophical di&s;coveries of the &s;ame nature con|veyed by different pens? Are there not many authors, who relate the &s;ame hi&s;torical facts? many divines who make di&s;qui&s;itions on one the|ological &s;ubject? and &s;hall moral writers be denied this privilege? Al|mo&s;t every author has &s;ome new ideas in his writing; and the language of one may impre&s;s the minds of &s;ome readers, though it may &s;carcely affect the under&s;tandings of others. This, it is hoped, will be con&s;idered a little apology for the pre&s;ent intru|&s;ion: and were not &s;ome apology introduced, &s;en&s;ibility would extort the latent blu&s;h, when the author contemplated tho&s;e &s;hining orna|ments of the age who&s;e writings are
<PB N="v" REF="030397_0004_0FE6C58CD2CBA928">&s;o highly &s;uperior, and ought to per|petuate their memories.</P>
<P>The generous and the candid will pa&s;s over any &s;entiments that may not be entirely congenial with their own; and on the &s;ame principles the author would rely for any inaccura|cy that may occur. The cen&s;ure of vulgar or unfeeling minds, ought ever to be con&s;idered as too in&s;ignificant to be regarded.</P>
<P>The&s;e Tales are original; and if the reader only takes a &s;light per|&s;pective around, there will appear may features in life which bear a perfect re&s;emblance. The author has endeavoured to give a few real copies of &s;ome important tran&s;ac|tions, and from thence drawn ides tending to regulate moral affections,
<PB N="vi" REF="030397_0005_0FE6C58CE103C458">to awaken a love of virtue, and to render civil intercour&s;e more plea&s;|ing.</P>
<P>Happine&s;s is an object of univer&s;al &s;earch; and &s;urely, if any thing can be pointed out that may lead to &s;o de&s;irable and end, it will not lie neg|lected by tho&s;e who are votaries.</P>
<P>Should the&s;e little efforts meet with approbation, the author will feel ample &s;atisfaction.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER I. TO MISS LOUISA HARTLEY.</HEAD>

<P>I HAVE often almo&s;t per&s;uaded my&s;elf, that if it were not for the &s;ingular degree of attachment, which I flatter my|&s;elf
<PB N="10" REF="030397_0008_0FE6C594F08F1378">you feel for me, your patience would are now have been tired with the trifling incidents I have &s;o perpetually heaped upon you in the cour&s;e of my corre&s;pondence: but the candid manner in which you con|tinue to treat my &s;cruples, I confe&s;s in a mea&s;ure abates them. I do not in the lea&s;t di&s;&s;emble, when I tell you, that one of the greate&s;t felicities I enjoy, is having a friend who&s;e mind is &s;o perfectly &s;imilar to my own&mdash;equally as happy to commu|nicate as to receive;&mdash;though I mu&s;t be free enough to add, I wi&s;h the former could be a little more practi&s;ed. Ah, my dear Loui&s;a! were friend&s;hip always contracted on right principles, we &s;hould &s;eldom &s;ee &s;uch revolutions in its profe&s;|&s;ion, nor would our ears be &s;o often offended with its illiberal tendencies. But, alas! what extremes are continually pre&s;ented to our view, merely for want of properly under&s;tanding the term&mdash;or, perhaps, be being too in&s;en&s;ible to its &s;a|cred influences!</P>
<P>We need only take a per&s;pective around us, and innumerable in&s;tances will per|fectly evince the reality of the&s;e reflec|tions
<PB N="11" REF="030397_0009_0FE6C595032E06A0">&mdash;from exce&s;s of profe&s;&s;ed friend|&s;hip, to an equal extreme of actual ha|tred. And what adds to the misfortune &s;till more, is, that it cea&s;es not its ravages, nor is confined to either &s;ex or &s;tation.</P>
<P>The female &s;ex, my dear, of which we have the honour to be a part, too often disfigure the natural delicacy with which they are favoured by Providence, by a propen&s;ity to the&s;e extremes; whil&s;t tho&s;e of the other &s;ex, who are exalted in life, abu&s;e the beneficence of the great Crea|tor, by not cultivating &s;uch feelings as would reflect an honour on their benefac|tor, and afford a la&s;ting &s;ource of peace to them&s;elves.</P>
<P>When we con&s;ider, my dear, that we are created &s;ocial beings, and that it is not repugnant to the fine&s;t principles of rea&s;on, religion, or humanity, to be actuated by &s;ocial principles; we cannot help lamenting, that people &s;hould &s;o de|generate in their ideas as well as in their practice. Nor is it le&s;s unfortunate, that tho&s;e who feel, or <HI>affect to feel,</HI> the plea&s;|ures of <HI>friend&s;hip,</HI> &s;hould be &s;o changea|ble in their profe&s;&s;ion of it. The truth
<PB N="12" REF="030397_0010_0FE6C59642EBF0A8">however is, we are more ready to di&s;cover and magnify error aboard than at home. I cannot help per&s;uading my&s;elf, how particularly unhappy it is for females, that they expo&s;e them&s;elves &s;o frequently to this foible: for if, in their civil inter|cour&s;e with &s;ociety, they are often di&s;cov|ering little incidents to di&s;gu&s;t and <HI>fluctu|ate</HI> their friend&s;hips, it is but too probable they will dive&s;t them&s;elves of every ra|tional &s;entiment, and will equally fluctu|ate in the nearer connexions of life&mdash;even in tho&s;e of <HI>wife</HI> and <HI>mother.</HI> I would forbear&mdash;but examples are too prevalent. Let women &s;tudy them&s;elves, and only think a moment for what they were made; and, if they cannot heal a wound, let them not make it deeper.</P>
<P>Happy, my dear, is it for us, that we are ble&s;t with rea&s;on and &s;en&s;ibility enough, to protect us, in &s;ome degree, from the&s;e extremes; and it would be the highe&s;t ingratitude, were we to deny that we are re&s;trained from exce&s;s by the kind interpo&s;ition of a &s;uperior power.</P>
<P>Though nature has been liberal in be|&s;towing on us active minds, yet it would
<PB N="13" REF="030397_0011_0FE6C59651D333B0">be very irrational to deny the benefits of education. Many a gem continues hidden in the earth, out of the reach of di&s;covery; and there are many capacities capable of the greate&s;t improvement, which, by in|digent circum&s;tances, are hid to the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;or and to the world; &s;ociety is denied the benefit of their &s;ervices; and we have rea&s;on to fear, that many important di&s;|coveries are forever lo&s;t.</P>
<P>I do not mean, however, to awaken gratitude in your brea&s;t for the &s;uperior advantages you have enjoyed; I know you too well to doubt the efficacy of your good &s;en&s;e. But as letters of friend&s;hip &s;ometimes fall into the hands of other friends be&s;ides tho&s;e for whom they were originally intended, &s;o mine may not, perhaps, e&s;cape the eyes of &s;ome, who&s;e minds, for want of cultivation, make but and unplea&s;ing appearance in life.</P>
<P>Rea&s;on and humanity teach us to love our fellow creatures; therefore we &s;hould endeavour to promote their happine&s;s, by communicating &s;uch ideas as may &s;eem mo&s;t calculated for that purpo&s;e. If there are any within the limits of your
<PB N="14" REF="030397_0012_0FE6C59E1A469BB8">acquaintance who corre&s;pond with the portrait I have drawn, that which I write for the amu&s;ement of my dear Loui&s;a, will &s;erve for their information.</P>
<P>To illu&s;trate a virtuous character, I propo&s;e giving you a &s;hort account of my two young friends, Mr. and Mrs. An&s;ell. We contracted an intimate acquaintance with the&s;e amiable people a &s;hort time &s;ince at a watering-place. My mother was &s;o highly plea&s;ed with their conver&s;ation, that &s;he gave them a general invitation to our hou&s;e, whenever they could make it convenient to vi&s;it the metropolis. We little &s;u&s;pected, that they would have made choice of our company, to cheer their drooping &s;pirits, when the hand of death had cau&s;ed them to &s;ink, by depriv|ing them of the con&s;olations of a tender father and kind friend. The hi&s;tory of this good man is &s;o plea&s;ingly interwoven, that I know you will be delighted at the tale; but the length of this epi&s;tle obliges me to po&s;tpone it till my next.</P>
<P>I have tre&s;pa&s;&s;ed, perhaps, on your time and patience too long. Pardon the error, if it is &s;o&mdash;and be a&s;&s;ured that the
<PB N="15" REF="030397_0013_0FE6C59E28715CF0">idea of having an affectionate remem|brance in the bo&s;om of Loui&s;a, will always be an addition to the happine&s;s of</P>

<P>You may well enough, my dear Matilda, conclude with the query, <HI>If it is &s;o</HI>&mdash;an error: but what would you, or the world, think of my judgment, if I reproached you for the length of your epi&s;tles? You di&s;cover too much kind|ne&s;s in communicating to Loui&s;a exam|ples of in&s;truction, ever to &s;uffer an un|generous conclu&s;ion to enter her bo&s;om.</P>
<P>Your ideas of friend&s;hip and edu|cation perfectly coincide with mine. It is certainly under the influence of the lat|ter that the former is mo&s;t likely to have a permanent footing in the human heart. As the faculties of the mind are expanded
<PB N="16" REF="030397_0014_0FE6C59F39185D10">by education, &s;o the judgment becomes le&s;s liable to err. Ob&s;ervation is ever ready to di&s;cern&mdash;but if reflection be ma|ture, we &s;hall counterbalance the errors of our friends with tho&s;e of our own&mdash;and after all, perhaps, the &s;cale will pre|ponderate on the &s;ide where we lea&s;t ex|pected it.</P>
<P>A &s;en&s;ible mind will endeavour to re&s;i&s;t every impediment to its peace; convinced that if anger, re&s;entment, or any other vice interpo&s;e, their baneful effects will be more ea&s;ily traced, both in per&s;on and action, and will produce a more un&s;eemly a&s;pect, than in the profe&s;&s;edly vulgar.</P>
<P>Your incidents, my dear, are not <HI>tri|fling</HI>&mdash;therefore do not wound my &s;en&s;i|bility &s;o much as to repeat the idea. It is not indeed trifling, to aim at promot|ing virtue, and extirpating vice. That man or woman, who is &s;o far employed in the cau&s;e of humanity, as to endeavour to cheer tho&s;e who are &s;inking under the weighty oppre&s;&s;ions of life, and to &s;often the obdurate heart of the haughty oppre&s;|&s;or, is engaged in a de&s;ign that is of too noble a nature to bear the epithet of <HI>trifling.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="030397_0015_0FE6C59F4C916070">
I anticipate &s;omething intere&s;ting in the relation of Mr. and Mrs. An&s;ell; and I con&s;ider my&s;elf greatly indebted to your kindne&s;s for introducing the tale. Precepts accompanied with examples, generally impre&s;s the young mind more than when given &s;eparately: I &s;hall therefore pre&s;ume upon your conjecture, and &s;hew your amu&s;ing letters to others of my young friends&mdash;&s;ome of tho&s;e too, perhaps, of the de&s;cription you have giv|en me. Should their happine&s;s thereby be promoted, we &s;hall feel a mutual reward.</P>
<P>You have liberty to exerci&s;e my pa|tience as much as you plea&s;e, it will not be &s;oon exhau&s;ted; nor will it be deemed a tre&s;pa&s;s. Let us each improve upon the idea, <HI>not to di&s;&s;emble in the pur&s;uit of friend&s;hip.</HI> Be a&s;&s;ured, I am as happy to receive as you are kind to communicate. You mu&s;t, however, acquit me of neglect, in not writing to you oftener. I will do it at a more convenient &s;ea&s;on. But the duty I owe to my aged parent, mu&s;t, for the pre&s;ent, &s;uper&s;ede the nece&s;&s;ity of my writing long letters. His declining &s;tate
<PB N="18" REF="030397_0016_0FE6C5A5B71159E0">of life and health requires &s;o much atten|tion, as to preclude me from a &s;ufficient interval. I know you will excu&s;e me on the ground of duty: but I look forward to days, when my father may enjoy a bet|ter &s;tate of health. In the mean time, I will acknowledge the receipt of your epi&s;tles, either by verbal me&s;&s;ages or con|ci&s;e notes.</P>

<P>LOUISA's affectionate letter I received, and her philo&s;ophical rea&s;oning afforded amu&s;ement.</P>
<P>Agreeably, my dear, to your reque&s;t, I acquit you of neglect, &s;ince you have &s;ugge&s;ted a future period. I will patient|ly wait till tho&s;e intervals arrive, when, by the re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of your father's health, your time and inclination will en|able
<PB N="20" REF="030397_0018_0FE6C5A84B56D118">you to imitate the example of Matil|da. Believe me, I feel a plea&s;ing exulta|tion in the reflection, that I have a friend who will not on any account de&s;ert her duty to her parent. Continue in the exerci&s;e of your plea&s;ing employment. Plea&s;ing, did I &s;ay? Yes;&mdash;indeed it mu&s;t be &s;o; particularly if we look for|ward to the days of infirmity. Where &s;hall we find the child who&s;e feelings are not amply &s;atisfied with the reflection, that age called them into exerci&s;e; and where &s;hall we &s;ee the aged &s;ire, who does not receive the attention of a child, with double the plea&s;ure he would that of an indifferent per&s;on?</P>
<P>I &s;hall now proceed with Mrs. An&s;ell's narrative. We were one day &s;itting to|gether after dinner, bu&s;ily employed with our needle-work, when I ob&s;erved that her &s;pirits appeared very much depre&s;&s;ed. Being under the nece&s;&s;ity of leaving the room a few minutes to give orders in the family, I was prevented from endeavour|ing to inve&s;tigate the cau&s;e. On my re|turn, are I had opened the door, me|thought I heard an echo like the&s;e words,
<PB N="21" REF="030397_0019_0FE6C5A85A2972E0">"O my father! my father!" I imme|diately looked &s;tedfa&s;tly in her face; but &s;he made every effort to conceal her grief, and turned towards the window. A heavy &s;ight, however, &s;oon &s;hook her tender frame, and intere&s;ted my heart in her fa|vour. I accordingly took a &s;ide-glance at her face, and ob&s;erved a tear now and then &s;teal involuntarily down her cheek.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t have been po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of more than bruti&s;h in&s;en&s;ibility, if my feelings on &s;uch an occa&s;ion had not been called into ac|tion. I immediately ran to her, and a&s;k|ed her the cau&s;e of her unea&s;ine&s;s. She begged met not to be frightened, for that &s;he hoped &s;he &s;hould &s;oon recover her&s;elf. I then lent her my &s;melling-bottle, and after &s;ome minutes' pau&s;e &s;he thus con|tinued:</P>
<P>"If I were not convinced, my dear Matilda, of the goodne&s;s of your heart, I &s;hould feel more unea&s;ine&s;s at the trou|ble I have ju&s;t given you; but as I am per|fectly per&s;uaded you are always as ready to &s;hare in the griefs and &s;orrows of your friends as you are in their joys and plea&s;ures, I will not he&s;itate to di&s;clo&s;e
<PB N="22" REF="030397_0020_0FE6C5AFF5BA9F98">the feelings of my bo&s;om. You are ac|quainted, my dear, with the lo&s;s I have lately &s;u&s;tained in the death of my father." Here &s;he &s;obbed, and it was with great difficulty &s;he could go on. "He was," &s;ays &s;he, "an amiable parent, and his virtues will ever be deeply impre&s;&s;ed on my mind. The guardian of my happi|ne&s;s in the years of childhood and youth is no more!&mdash;I need not the&s;e mournful colours with which I am decorated, to keep my &s;en&s;ibility alive; his ab&s;ence is &s;ufficient! But you are already anxious to know &s;omething more particular re|&s;pecting him. I will, therefore, endeav|our to &s;atisfy your curio&s;ity: but I can|not &s;eparate the hi&s;tory of my father from that of my&s;elf&mdash;you mu&s;t therefore take them in connexion.</P>
<P>"My father was the &s;on of a merchant in London; and, being left with a con|&s;iderable fortune, had but little to fear from the frowns, and le&s;s to court from the &s;miles, of the world. He was natu|rally of a delicate turn of mind, and very fond of retirement; in con&s;equence of which, he fled from the bu&s;y croud to a
<PB N="23" REF="030397_0021_0FE6C5B0083F2138">beautiful &s;eat in Hamp&s;hire, which bor|dered on the &s;ea-&s;hore. Here he devoted a great part of his time to reading and &s;tudy. The celebrated works of the an|cient Grecian and Roman authors were familiar to him;&mdash;hi&s;tory and philo&s;ophy were his chief delight; his imaginations were attentively carried to all parts of the world; nor did he &s;uffer &s;carce any thing to e&s;cape his penetrating genius, from the minute&s;t infect to the great globe it&s;elf. From the&s;e acqui&s;itions he had learned to make a proper e&s;timate of men&punc; and to be very impartial in his deci&s;ions on manners.</P>
<P>"But though he had a ta&s;te for a &s;oli|tary life, yet he was not in&s;en&s;ible to the plea&s;ures of friend&s;hip. He made choice of a few &s;elect friends, who&s;e minds in &s;ome degree bore a &s;imilarity to his own. Occa&s;ional vi&s;its took place; at one of which he became enamoured with the &s;i&s;|ter of his ho&s;t.</P>
<P>"His partiality increa&s;ed, from the re|peated di&s;coveries he made of the good|ne&s;s of her heart: nor could he, after a few intervals, cea&s;e to inform her of the
<PB N="24" REF="030397_0022_0FE6C5B117AC5168">impre&s;&s;ion &s;he had made on his mind. She received his care&s;&s;es with a becoming &s;implicity, without immediately &s;tifling his hopes or increa&s;ing his fears. At ev|ery interview he &s;aw &s;omething more en|chanting to animate his prejudices in her favour. A mind po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the greate&s;t tenderne&s;s, a gentle, kind, and affable di&s;|po&s;ition, joined to a good under&s;tanding, were di&s;coveries that operated too pow|erfully to &s;uffer him any longer to re|main in &s;u&s;pen&s;e.</P>
<P>"The next opportunity he a&s;&s;ured her how much happine&s;s he enjoyed in her friend&s;hip; though he was in hopes a greater degree of it was &s;till in re&s;erve for him, by his having a &s;hare in her af|fections. Yet he candidly confe&s;&s;ed, that if the latter were not po&s;&s;ible, he would not he&s;itate to withdraw every preten&s;ion; for, by per&s;i&s;ting, he &s;hould not only de|&s;troy her pre&s;ent peace, but make the re|covery of his own, at lea&s;t for a while, inevitable.</P>
<P>"It were next to impo&s;&s;ible, for a &s;u&s;|ceptible heart not to be captivated with a mind that could make a profe&s;&s;ion of
<PB N="25" REF="030397_0023_0FE6C5B1278BB7E0">e&s;teem in &s;o open and generous a manner. Nor was her reply le&s;s plea&s;ing.</P>
<P>'Your open and manly conduct to|wards me, my dear Sir, added to the be|nevolence with which you are actuated, attract my admiration and e&s;teem. It is true, I have taken but a &s;hort period, in compari&s;on with the generality of the world, to inve&s;tigate your preten&s;ions, and to form an adequate idea of my own de|terminate feelings. I am not, I hope, led to an extreme that will ever be a bane to my peace. I have too much confidence in your good &s;en&s;e, to believe you will put an illiberal con&s;truction on my &s;entiments, when I inform you how much I have &s;e|cretly admired your virtues. You are worthy the favour you a&s;k, and I now candidly avow my attachment. And though it may be deemed a deviation from delicacy in me to declare &s;o early in your favour, yet I can triumph no lon|ger over tho&s;e feelings of your bo&s;om, in which my own are &s;o intimately con|cerned. Take, Sir, my heart, which is your own. I place the firme&s;t reliance on your confidence, and anticipate the
<PB N="26" REF="030397_0024_0FE6C5B3D22B94B0">&s;weets of &s;ocial enjoyment in your affec|tionate &s;ociety. At a proper time, my hand &s;hall follow what you have already in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. Continue the generous character you have hitherto exhibited, and you will be worthy of every feeble effort I can make to con&s;titute your hap|pine&s;s. Let propriety di&s;tingui&s;h our con|duct, and it will be well."</P>
<P>"The artle&s;s and unaffected &s;tyle in which &s;he &s;poke, &s;o powerfully operated on my father, that he exclaimed with a degree of rapture,</P>
<P>'How can I be &s;ilent any longer? Gen|erous woman! I have often beheld thee as one of the be&s;t of thy &s;ex; but now, methinks, thou art the mo&s;t exalted of all.

"After a proper time had elap&s;ed, the day of celebration was fixed on, and they were married.</P>
<P>"Though I have only been able to col|lect a few &s;cattered fragments of their court&s;hip (part of which I obtained from my father) yet I am per&s;uaded they were models of propriety and virtue; and were their example univer&s;ally adopted, it would &s;ave many from being the victims of folly and caprice. I believe you will agree with me, when I read to you two letters which pa&s;&s;ed between them a &s;hort time previous to their marriage, during my father's ab&s;ence from the country."</P>
<P>She then took from her pocket-book the letters, which &s;he told me &s;he &s;hould keep as &s;acred to the late&s;t period of her exi&s;tence, being the only intere&s;ting me|mentos of the kind &s;he had been able to re&s;cue from ob&s;curity.</P>

<P>NEITHER time nor di&s;tance have obliterated from my memory my lovely, my charming Eliza, nor ob&s;truct|ed one tender emotion of my bo&s;om to|wards her. It was with great reluctance I left the deare&s;t object of my &s;oul, and with &s;till greater do I continue &s;o long ab&s;ent. It &s;eems as though time had un|dergone an entire revolution:
<Q>Days &s;eem like weeks, and weeks like months.</Q>
Such is the infatuation which attends the &s;entimental lover!</P>
<P>Would &s;ome winged cour&s;er friendly &s;peed me to thy pre&s;ence, how exqui&s;itely happy mu&s;t I feel in the flight!&mdash;But you will call me enthu&s;ia&s;t. I confe&s;s, indeed, when I am thinking on you, I am often lo&s;t in a plea&s;ing delirium. A few days more will, however, enable me to &s;ettle my bu&s;ine&s;s in town, and I &s;hall then ha&s;|ten to the joy I anticipate.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="030397_0027_0FE6C5B9EDDD93C0">
Happy, doubly happy am I, when I re|flect on the virtues of your mind. It was not, my dear, your per&s;onal charms alone that attracted my notice&mdash;no, it was &s;ome|thing more.</P>
<Q><L>&mdash;Virtue will protect it&s;elf amid&s;t</L>
<L>Ten thou&s;and &s;nares, amid ten thou&s;and woes.&mdash;</L></Q>
<P>Though I de&s;pi&s;e the &s;entiments of that man or woman, who can build their hopes of happine&s;s on &s;hadows that quickly pa&s;s by; I pity the objects who&s;e pa&s;&s;ions are &s;o blindly captivated as to leave them the dupes of their own depravity. It is in|deed po&s;&s;ible for per&s;onal charms to be blended with a mind equally attracting; nor can there, I think, be a more plea&s;ing &s;ight.</P>
<P>Time will naturally furrow the beauties of nature; but the mind mu&s;t bear up un|der every vici&s;&s;itude, that the body may be protected from too &s;trong impre&s;&s;ions. A mind like this, I am happy in believ|ing you are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of. It is highly ne|ce&s;&s;ary you &s;hould be thus armed; per|plexities are natural to the human &s;pecies; and you may, perhaps, hereafter have to
<PB N="30" REF="030397_0028_0FE6C5BFC8E17FA0">contend with many little foibles in me, which at pre&s;ent you are a &s;tranger to. But as I believe our affections are mutual, I am the more ready to conclude we &s;hall equally aim at extenuating the effects of folly on each other's mind. Were I to tell you I expected perfection, I &s;hould di&s;|&s;emble too much from my own per&s;ua&s;ions to gain any credit from one &s;o capable of di&s;tingui&s;hing as your&s;elf. I mu&s;t howev|er in&s;i&s;t, that the degree of excellence you have di&s;covered in the cour&s;e of our ac|quaintance, has rooted an idea in my mind that, unle&s;s I can claim the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of &s;uch excellence for my own, virtue it&s;elf will be the de&s;truction of my peace.</P>
<Q><L>"Then let me hold thee to my heart,</L>

<P>I CANNOT in ju&s;tice to my own feelings deny your reque&s;t; have therefore taken my pen to addre&s;s you previous to your return. But in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of my mind, methinks it is impo&s;&s;ible for me to write in &s;uch a manner as &s;hall contribute to my own &s;atisfaction, or your happine&s;s. You may learn, however,&mdash;you may be convinced in what a &s;acred view I hold your peace: yes, Charles, it is linked with my own con&s;olation;&mdash;it is, in &s;hort, my own peace. And however I may &s;e|cretly blu&s;h at this open confe&s;&s;ion, yet believe me, I feel for you as I never felt for any other per&s;on in my life.</P>
<P>The genero&s;ity and candour with which you dictated your la&s;t, merit all the ap|plau&s;e I can po&s;&s;ibly give them. By pro|tecting me from my own imperfections on
<PB N="32" REF="030397_0030_0FE6C5C273FB8A78">one hand, and warning me of your foibles on the other, you have impo&s;ed a &s;tronger motive for confidence and e&s;teem: nor do I &s;o much fluctuate under pre&s;ent cir|cum&s;tances, as I might, perhaps, if I had not a perfect conviction of the integrity of the man with whom I am &s;ooner or later to be united.</P>
<P>Perplexities are indeed the common lot of humanity; yet I am convinced, that rectitude of conduct, were it more univer|&s;al, would &s;pare many from the troubles they experience. How depraved is the hu|man mind! Though it dreads natural and unavoidable calamities; yet, how &s;wiftly does it fly to tho&s;e unfriendly exce&s;&s;es, which are certain to involve in &s;till great|er difficulties! The reflection, I confe&s;s, is unplea&s;ing&mdash;but not more &s;o, I fear, than it is true.</P>
<P>View the principles which actuate the world in general; and in&s;tead of wonder|ing that life appears &s;o very uncomforta|ble, we mu&s;t be a&s;toni&s;hed that it is not beyond conception wor&s;e. Pride, avarice, with all their horrid attendants, &s;eem to be the moving &s;ources of action; and
<PB N="33" REF="030397_0031_0FE6C5C2870DD8E0">if vice remains at the root, it cannot pro|duce virtue. Such alas! are the propen|&s;ities which are often the means of joining the mo&s;t di&s;affected minds in the conjugal &s;tate, and of in&s;uring to them a life of perpetual mi&s;ery. I hope we &s;hall e&s;cape the&s;e &s;nares, &s;ince a mutual and firm affec|tion will guide us to the altar; nor will one bitter reflection interpo&s;e, to dimini&s;h that &s;ublime peace and tranquillity which will invariably be nurtured in our bo&s;oms. I do not mean, however, to exult over the unfortunate:&mdash;No; objects of di&s;tre&s;s, whatever may be the original cau&s;e of their mi&s;ery, demand the utmo&s;t pity from feeling hearts.</P>
<P>But to be a little more &s;erious with you, my dear Sir! You &s;eem to lay by your &s;teady philo&s;ophical powers, when you &s;tart even the po&s;&s;ibility of <HI>excellency</HI> to be the <HI>de&s;truction</HI> of your <HI>peace.</HI> The compliment you paid me I &s;hould have received with di&s;gu&s;t, as a piece of the mo&s;t offen&s;ive flattery, from any other but your&s;elf;&mdash;but how oppo&s;ite were my feelings, when I &s;hed the &s;ilent tear over your wandering lines! It was not the tear of di&s;dain&mdash;no,
<PB N="34" REF="030397_0032_0FE64B7E2A902DE0">Charles; it was that of pity. I anticipa|ted the penetrating &s;igh which bur&s;t from your heart when you was penning the idea; and lamented the treachery of your rea&s;on, that it &s;hould de&s;ert you at the very moment when the weake&s;s of humanity demanded its a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>Recollect, Sir, a thou&s;and difficulties may yet await us, and finally di&s;&s;olve the union you wi&s;h: one moment does not bring a protection for the next, nor does the evening &s;hade in&s;ure to us the morn|ing light. Were the arm of death to ca&s;t an arrow at my feeble frame, and take me from you and all my friends; would rea&s;on then for&s;ake you, and leave you to dwindle out a mi&s;erable exi&s;tence, de&s;ti|tute of one con&s;olatory moment?&mdash;For|bid it, Heaven! The idea pierces my heart.</P>
<P>It is probable, in the height of your ec&s;ta&s;y, you may have made a very im|proper e&s;timate of my excellence; but, &s;uppo&s;ing it to be a perfect one, would you not triumph at the exchange of virtue which at be&s;t is only in a fluctuating &s;tate, for that cele&s;tial purity and happine&s;s
<PB N="35" REF="030397_0033_0FE6C5C915BFE2E8">which can never change nor decay? Yes, &s;urely you would. I will venture to in|dulge the thought, that in&s;tead of virtue oppo&s;ing your peace, it would produce an harmony which would only clo&s;e with your exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>But in the mid&s;t of all my rea&s;oning, I find it is ea&s;ier to give advice than apply it; and mu&s;t confe&s;s, that I am often lo&s;t in the mo&s;t plea&s;ing anticipations; the&s;e I am continually anxious to realize.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER VI. TO MISS LOUISA HARTLEY.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>LONDON.</HI></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>NOTHING in this world can animate me to pur&s;ue the intere&s;ting hi&s;|tory of Mr. and Mrs. An&s;ell, but the plea&s;ure I have received from it, and the
<PB N="36" REF="030397_0034_0FE6C5CB38EA01E0">de&s;ire of communicating it to my dear Loui&s;a. I know not where it will end, nor am I particularly anxious about it.</P>
<P>Mrs. An&s;ell, after reading the letters, was going on with her narrative, when we were interrupted by the appearance of the &s;ervant with the tea-things. As &s;oon as they were removed &s;he re&s;umed her tale, and related as follows:</P>
<P>"To be as conci&s;e as po&s;&s;ible," &s;aid the excellent woman, "the fir&s;t year produ|ced them a fine boy. It lived only a few months, during which period the world &s;eemed to be neglected by them, as an empty void, and their mutual happine&s;s centered in the dear babe. The next year produced them a girl, which was <HI>your friend.</HI> This happy period too was but &s;hort:&mdash;my mother, after &s;uckling me three months, was &s;eized with a violent cold which &s;ettled on her lungs. The phy&s;icians ordered her to refrain from &s;uckling; but, alas! every effort was in vain&mdash;a ha&s;ty con&s;umption carried her off in about &s;ix weeks.</P>
<P>"My father, rendered di&s;con&s;olate by this adver&s;e &s;troke, was &s;eized with a &s;tu|pefaction.
<PB N="37" REF="030397_0035_0FE6C5CB4D45F300">He &s;aw but few people, and knew not tho&s;e he &s;aw;&mdash;till at length, one of his intimate friends, who had more influence over him than the re&s;t, ventur|ed to rea&s;on with him on his &s;ituation.</P>
<P>"When his recollection was recovered, he remembered that the infant of his dear|e&s;t partner claimed his paternal regard&mdash;and determined from that moment to de|vote the whole of his time to me; and, to palliate his misfortune, to make me (as he termed it) "the exact re&s;emblance of his dear Eliza." How far my fath|er has &s;ucceeded in his wi&s;hes, I am not at liberty to &s;ay: though I may with pro|priety affirm, that no parent ever took more pains to in&s;til the pure&s;t principles of virtue into the mind of a child than him&s;elf.</P>
<P>"A nur&s;e was taken into the hou&s;e, to attend me through my infant days. As I grew, &s;o my father's fondne&s;s increa&s;ed. At the age of four years he began to in|&s;truct my tender mind; and it affords me a &s;ingular degree of plea&s;ure when I rec|ollect his a&s;&s;iduity, and the happine&s;s it gave him.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="030397_0036_0FE6C5D31FA902D0">
"He procured me &s;uch books as he thought would gradually open and plea&s;e my tender mind, fir&s;t carefully peru&s;ing them him&s;elf. He taught me every rel|ative duty; not with an air of au&s;terity, which is too common among parents, but with that &s;erenity and cheerfulne&s;s, which, in&s;tead of agitating the brea&s;t with fearful apprehen&s;ions, in&s;pire the mind with a kind of mode&s;t confidence, and dif|fu&s;e mutual happine&s;s to the &s;ire and the babe. He kept me chiefly under his own eye, yet he thought it ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;a|ry that I &s;hould be introduced a little to &s;ociety, le&s;t a &s;hyne&s;s became habitual, and rendered me a di&s;agreeable companion when nece&s;&s;ity called me more immediate|ly into life. He &s;ought a few young a&s;&s;o|ciates for me, as well that I might copy good examples, as avoid bad ones; and when I remarked any mi&s;conduct in my young friends, as not agreeable to the impre&s;&s;ions I had received, he endeav|oured to &s;tifle the idea of my &s;uperior|ity, by con&s;truing every error into a le&s;&s;on for my future conduct. If I chanced my|&s;elf to deviate from the path in which he
<PB N="39" REF="030397_0037_0FE6C5D32DCB0D90">had in&s;tructed me, he pointed out my fault, and its con&s;equence, with that de|gree of delicacy and tenderne&s;s which is ever a more powerful mean of exciting reformation, than au&s;terity and correction.</P>
<P>"Thus in&s;tructed, the motives which impelled me to love, urged tho&s;e tender fears to offend an honoured father, which &s;pring from gratitude, and which ought to inhabit the brea&s;t of every child.</P>
<P>"My mind, which was rather active, expanded it&s;elf every day; and I &s;oon be|gan to learn the importance of religion and virtue. Young and &s;u&s;ceptible as I was, no wonder if the baits of vice had ea&s;y acce&s;s to my heart. But though I did not enter into tho&s;e unhappy errors which &s;o often en&s;nare the younger, yet I felt &s;uch propen&s;ities to err as co&s;t me ma|ny &s;evere conflicts. Yes, Matilda! I &s;aw the excellence of education, and adored the wi&s;dom of that Providence who had appointed me &s;uch a friend and parent.</P>
<P>"In dome&s;tic exerci&s;es were my youth|ful hours partly employed; my father judging that a knowledge of tho&s;e affairs was as nece&s;&s;ary for a woman, as an ex|ten&s;ive
<PB N="40" REF="030397_0038_0FE6C54D09DD3908">knowledge of the world. At length I arrived to tho&s;e years when a mutual confidence became indi&s;pen&s;able; and he endeavoured by gentle and per&s;ua|&s;ive arguments to di&s;pel every fear that op|po&s;ed it.</P>
<P>"I now reached my twentieth year; and my vanity was often flattered by &s;ev|eral young beaux, who endeavoured to ingratiate them&s;elves in my favour. Though I was at times plea&s;ed with their artifice, yet my rea&s;on kept the a&s;cendan|cy &s;o far ever my heart, as to prevent my becoming a victim to impo&s;ture. I laid every preten&s;ion before my father with &s;implicity, who always advi&s;ed me as an intimate friend, but never urged again&s;t my inclination.</P>
<P>"Mr. An&s;ell was &s;oon after introduced to our hou&s;e by a neighbouring gentleman. At fir&s;t &s;ight of the lovely youth I felt my|&s;elf embarra&s;&s;ed, but was almo&s;t at a lo&s;s to know the rea&s;on. The &s;ilent blu&s;h conveyed powerful ideas to each of our minds; and I then for the fir&s;t time be|gan to think my&s;elf really in love.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="030397_0039_0FE6C5D442CC6E40">
"While the two &s;enior gentlemen were employed in talking over the news of the day, the young &s;tranger addre&s;&s;ed me in an ea&s;y and bewitching manner. Our conver&s;ation turned chiefly upon books and poetry. He appeared &s;o intelligent, that his company became every moment more de&s;irable, and I wi&s;hed him only to give me the mo&s;t di&s;tant hint of his appro|bation. But this he prudently re&s;erved for another opportunity, when both our judg|ments might be more mature. However, he gave me to under&s;tand, that he &s;hould take the liberty of paying us a morning vi&s;it or two during his re&s;idence in the country. Invitations were exchanged on both &s;ides by the old gentlemen, and the two vi&s;itors departed.</P>
<P>"I remained in a &s;ituation better con|ceived than expre&s;&s;ed for the &s;pace of three days, continually wi&s;hing for a &s;econd in|terview: my appetite began to fail, and I was di&s;agreeably hara&s;&s;ed between fluc|tuating hopes and fears. The day came that di&s;&s;ipated my anxiety.</P>
<P>"As I was looking from the window, I &s;aw a young gentleman alight from his
<PB N="42" REF="030397_0040_0FE6C5C906A54B40">hor&s;e, and ha&s;ten towards the door. My heart leaped as it were within me; I felt tho&s;e tender emotions which are familiar to &s;en&s;ible minds in the&s;e &s;ituations.</P>
<P>"My father was gone to vi&s;it &s;ome poor objects who depended chiefly on his genero&s;ity for their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence; we were therefore alone. Mr. An&s;ell approached me with an air of mode&s;t a&s;&s;urance, which rendered him doubly captivating; and af|ter the fir&s;t compliments were over, we employed our&s;elves in a general conver|&s;ation.</P>
<P>"Two hours fled with the utmo&s;t ra|pidity, and he began to think of returning. He gently pre&s;&s;ed my hand, as a prelude to &s;omething more momentous. I antic|ipated his meaning, and fancied my&s;elf an excellent phy&s;iognomi&s;t. The language of his eyes was &s;o very pathetic, that I was ready to grant his reque&s;t before he had given me an opportunity.</P>
<P>"With a &s;mile of tenderne&s;s, he reque&s;t|ed to know if his addre&s;&s;es would be agree|able. I was ready to an&s;wer in the affir|mative;&mdash;but the recollection of duty which I owed my father, together with
<PB N="43" REF="030397_0041_0FE64B7E498B40A8">his generous behaviour toward me, forbad my doing it before I had at lea&s;t con&s;ult|ed him. I therefore told Mr. An&s;ell, that it was impo&s;&s;ible for me to give him a po&s;|itive an&s;wer, till I had obtained paternal approbation. This I articulated in a con|fu&s;ed manner, attended with a blu&s;h that rendered me for the moment very uncom|fortable. He relieved me from this awk|ward &s;ituation by approving of my re&s;olu|tion, and taking his leave, with a promi&s;e to wait on me in the cour&s;e of a few days.</P>
<P>"When my father returned, I acquaint|ed him with the circum&s;tance. He ap|proved of my conduct, and promi&s;ed to inquire into the character and &s;ituation of the young man. He accordingly made inquiries, and received the mo&s;t agreeable intelligence re&s;pecting him.</P>
<P>"As I &s;at one day in my chamber, mu&s;|ing on my &s;ituation&mdash;forming re&s;olutions and breaking them&mdash;my father entered, and &s;hut-to the door. His appearance ad|ded to the confu&s;ion of my mind. I was convinced &s;omething remarkable mu&s;t have hurried him into my apartment. He ob&s;erved my confu&s;ion, and di&s;&s;ipated my
<PB N="44" REF="030397_0042_0FE64B80087EDDA0">apprehen&s;ions by a&s;&s;uming a familiar a&s;|pect, and addre&s;&s;ing me as follows:</P>
<P>'I perceive, my dear, your embarra&s;&s;|ment; but do not let the pre&s;ence of your father di&s;turb the &s;erenity of your heart. Be calm, my love, nor ever di&s;tre&s;s me by doubting my confidence. I feel for you, as every parent ought to feel for a child. Remember, I was once young my&s;elf, and felt tho&s;e propen&s;ities which you are at pre&s;ent acquainted with. I have made in|quiries re&s;pecting Mr. An&s;ell, but find no|thing very flattering in his circum&s;tances. This, however, &s;hall be no ob&s;tacle. He has been unfortunately deprived of a great part of his property by the perfidious ava|rice of his guardian. I am highly plea&s;ed with his character. It is &s;uperior to rank and fortune. Receive his addre&s;&s;es&mdash;and be happy. You are my only child, therefore I cannot bear the idea of part|ing with you. I know you will not object to re&s;ide with me; particularly when I tell you, that the pro&s;pect of your happi|ne&s;s will be a great addition to my own. Do not, however, let me decide for you. You are come to an age in which the laws
<PB N="45" REF="030397_0043_0FE64B8028BDF268">of your country, as well as tho&s;e of hu|manity, leave you to your own choice. Think well, whether your mind be prepar|ed to &s;ubmit to be a wife. In learning to be a child, I will hope you have learned al&s;o to be a parent. Many important tru&s;ts will call your mind into action;&mdash;your real character will now be open to the world&mdash;for in no &s;ituation are the good or bad qualities of a per&s;on &s;o read|ily delineated as in he marriage &s;tate: beauties and deformities are traced with per&s;picuity&mdash;virtues and vices are expo&s;ed to the gazing world, and ridicule and con|tempt, or the mo&s;t di&s;gu&s;ting flattery, will flow from the retro&s;pect. The&s;e it is ne|ce&s;&s;ary you &s;hould be aware of, that you may avoid the &s;crutiny of the one, and be indifferent to the artifice of the other?</P>
<P>"He then held out the letters which I read to you, and continued:</P>
<P>'I pre&s;ent you with the&s;e letters, that you may be acquainted with the motives which united your parents. If you imi|tate the precepts they contain, you will arrive to the &s;ame &s;ummit of happine&s;s we enjoyed; but of what duration it will
<PB N="46" REF="030397_0044_0FE6C543F5FD0798">be, is only in the womb of Providence to determine.'</P>
<P>"Then, with tears of angui&s;h which penetrated my heart, he &s;aid, 'Ours was but &s;hort. The death of your mother was a &s;evere &s;hock to my feelings; and the only con&s;olation left me, was the cer|tainty that &s;he reached a &s;uperior abode of happine&s;s, where I hope one day or other to unite with her forever. In your pur&s;uit after happine&s;s, be prepared to meet the events of Providence with forti|tude: &s;teeled by the influence of relig|ion and virtue, you will feel a diminution of horror, and exhibit an example to the world worthy of imitation.'</P>
<P>"A &s;udden rap at the door put an end to his &s;peech; and I had only time to thank him for his kind intentions before his company was de&s;ired below.</P>
<P>"With tears of gratitude &s;treaming from my eyes, I was again left to my&s;elf. Contending between the pa&s;&s;ions of love and duty, I knew not which to place up|permo&s;t in my bo&s;om. When my judg|ment became a little cool, I re&s;olved to make them in&s;eparable companions. 'I
<PB N="47" REF="030397_0045_0FE6C5440B085F10">mu&s;t,' thought I, 'be ju&s;t, be dutiful and affectionate to my father&mdash;I feel I mu&s;t; though my heart be divided with another. Yes, I will nur&s;e him in his old age; and, as he protected me in the infirmities of infancy, &s;o will be a&s;&s;idu|ous in le&s;&s;ening the pangs of infirmity in his latter days. It is a ble&s;&s;ing to have &s;uch a father, and a privilege to be able to convince him of my e&s;teem by every dutiful office.'</P>
<P>"I was awakened from my reverie by the maid, who came to inform me that Mr. An&s;ell was waiting to &s;ee me. After collecting my &s;cattered &s;en&s;es as much as po&s;&s;ible, I ha&s;tened to the parlour. He ro&s;e to &s;alute me, and informed me that he had obtained permi&s;&s;ion of my father to wait on me, and reque&s;ted my appro|bation to complete his wi&s;hes. This I granted with a &s;mile&mdash;and I can only con|ceive of the feelings of his heart by tho&s;e of my own."</P>
<P>Here, my dear Loui&s;a, we were again interrupted by the &s;ervant, who came to inform us, that the &s;upper was ready; and I think it high time to clo&s;e this epi&s;tle.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER VII. TO MISS LOUISA HARTLEY&mdash;inclo&s;ed with the former.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>LONDON.</HI></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>MY la&s;t letter was rather too late for conveyance: but I think it a favoura|ble circum&s;tance; otherwi&s;e you would, perhaps, have been unplea&s;ingly &s;u&s;pend|ed in anxiety for the completion of Mrs. An&s;ell's hi&s;tory. As &s;oon as the table was cleared of the &s;upper, &s;he concluded as follows:</P>
<P>"The attachment between Mr. An&s;ell and my&s;elf became mutually &s;incere, and my father beheld it with plea&s;ure. I was &s;itting with the latter alone one day, when he addre&s;&s;ed me, as near as I can recollect, in the&s;e words: 'My dear Eliza, I was once vain enough to hope, that your merit would have rai&s;ed you to a di&s;tinction in life, that would have been an honour to my old age; but, upon reflection, I found that my rational moments were &s;ometimes invaded by &s;lights of fancy that flowed from ambition and pride&mdash;imagin|ation
<PB N="49" REF="030397_0047_0FE6C54ADAF0D1F0">at times elevated my mind, as well as my body, to an immen&s;e height; but, alas! a &s;light movement hurried it from the baneful precipice; it returned cha|grined to its former &s;entiments, and folly &s;tared it in the face. I forgot that con|tentment was equally attainable in the middle as in the higher ranks of &s;ociety&mdash;and that a pea&s;ant could boa&s;t of its famil|iar intercour&s;e with a king. Ob&s;ervation however interpo&s;ed, and ridiculed my de|lirium&mdash;I then called my&s;elf a fool, and determined never to be bia&s;&s;ed by &s;uch mo|tives in future. In this re&s;olution I have continued &s;tedfa&s;t, and am happy in the pro&s;pect that you are likely to be united with one, who, though he cannot be&s;tow on you wealth nor titles, yet will watch tenderly over your peace. I long for the morning to dawn when you will both be happy; and I hope you will cultivate tho&s;e principles (however unfa&s;hionable) that are mo&s;t likely to conduce to happine&s;s.'</P>
<P>"Mr. An&s;ell was obliged to return to London&mdash;but as &s;oon as a convenient op|portunity pre&s;ented it&s;elf we were marri|ed, in the pre&s;ence of my father. He liv|ed
<PB N="50" REF="030397_0048_0FE6C68D51235C10">with us fifteen months, and was delight|ed with the conjugal happine&s;s we enjoyed; for which he offered up his tribute of prai&s;e to the Giver of every good gift, who had pre&s;erved him to witne&s;s &s;uch enjoyment." She &s;ighed, and faintly articulated, "I now come to the clo&s;ing period of his ex|i&s;tence. He was taken with a violent cold, which brought on a fever. At intervals he was perfectly &s;en&s;ible: he &s;aw that his end approached; nor did he murmur at his fate. No timidity was to be &s;een on his countenance; no de&s;ire to prolong his days. The con&s;olations of religion animat|ed him with calmne&s;s and compo&s;ure, and taught him to look beyond the grave. He called us to his bed&s;ide, and taking each of us by the hand he &s;aid,</P>
<P>'My dear children, you have now to witne&s;s a &s;cene that humanity in general &s;hudders at. I feel I am ha&s;tening to my exit. The &s;troke I &s;uppo&s;e will be affect|ing to you both. But recollect, we were not &s;ent into this world to live in it for|ever; our probation is but &s;hort&mdash;we wander but a little &s;ea&s;on, and then we retire to a &s;ettled re&s;idence. It is good to

<Q><L>'&mdash;Draw his &s;teady bow,</L>
<L>And throw his quivering dart'&mdash;</L></Q>
I will extort no promi&s;e of tenderne&s;s to each other after my decea&s;e: my confi|dence forbids it, becau&s;e I have beheld your mutual attachment with uninter|rupted plea&s;ure; and were it not that my mind is prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with joys beyond the grave, nature would &s;ubmit with greater reluctance to the fatal blow. It is indeed a con&s;olation, that I leave my daughter in the hands of one who regards her happi|ne&s;s as his own: this reflection dive&s;ts me of every unplea&s;ing apprehen&s;ion, and I retire without a dread to the &s;ilent tomb. I fondly hoped to have enjoyed your &s;oci|ety many years; but the&s;e hopes are de|&s;troyed, and I am &s;upported by a more permanent one&mdash;even that of anticipating an in&s;eparable union. Continue in the exerci&s;e of religious virtue, and train your children up in her paths; and when you come to the clo&s;ing period, terror will yield to tranquillity, and the horrors of death will become the implements of bli&s;s.'</P>
<PB N="52" REF="030397_0050_0FE6C5D74B079BC0">
<P>"Then he pre&s;&s;ed our hands; and while the paternal tear &s;tole gently down his venerable cheek, he continued in a &s;till fainter voice, 'I now take an affec|tionate leave of you. Farewel, my dear children! May you be ble&s;&s;ed; and may the &s;miles of Heaven pro&s;per you!&mdash;I die in peace.'</P>
<P>"Exhau&s;ted with this exertion, he call|ed for a little wine, and after wetting his lips, he laid down and expired without a groan. Mr. An&s;ell and my&s;elf were bath|ed in agonizing tears, and with the mo&s;t &s;orrowful hearts we performed the la&s;t duties. Now &s;ay, Matilda, have I not enough to affect my feelings, to urge my tears? Few &s;uch fathers&mdash;few &s;uch friends!"</P>
<P>Here the &s;weet woman clo&s;ed her nar|rative; and I think &s;he has given us as perfect a hi&s;tory of an upright character as the world can produce. Her father had a generous mind, which made him the friend of virtue, and rendered him great through almo&s;t every action of his life. Magnanimity was con&s;picuous in his latter moments; and the &s;erenity with
<PB N="53" REF="030397_0051_0FE6C5DCF3182788">which he made his exit was a &s;pectacle of grandeur rarely to be equalled: and though his death was a &s;evere &s;troke to &s;urviving relatives, who but the unthink|ing would wi&s;h to have detained him a moment from the peaceful habitation to which he is gone?</P>
<P>Mr. and Mrs. An&s;ell have ju&s;t left us, and are returned to the family man&s;ion in Hamp&s;hire. They have made my fa|ther and &s;elf promi&s;e to vi&s;it them early in the &s;pring; and I confe&s;s I &s;hall be hap|py to embrace the opportunity. I felt a kind of &s;elfi&s;h &s;orrow at parting with them, and know not how to make up the lo&s;s any other way than by hoping again to &s;ee them.</P>
<P>I have taken a deal of trouble in com|mitting the above to paper. You will now be able to imitate my precedent, as I am informed your father gains &s;trength; for which rea&s;on you will have a little more time.

<HEAD>LETTER VIII. TO MISS MATILDA ROBINSON.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>BATH.</HI></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>MY dear Matilda will be a little &s;urpri&s;ed at the date of my letter. Ju&s;t as your la&s;t epi&s;tles arrived we were preparing for our journey, the phy&s;ician having advi&s;ed my father to drink the Bath waters. Perhaps I cannot better
<PB N="53" REF="030397_0053_0FE6C696645BC128">&s;atisfy you for the trouble you have taken, than by informing you that your letters afforded us &s;o much plea&s;ure as made us forget the fatigues of travelling. I am at a lo&s;s where to begin my commendation&mdash;and yet I think you have a prior claim. I admire your patience, and am going in a mea&s;ure to imitate it.</P>
<P>The de&s;cription Mrs. An&s;ell has given you of her father and mother, &s;urpa&s;&s;es every thing of the kind that has come with|in the circle of my knowledge. She might well &s;ay, that "were their example uni|ver&s;ally adopted, it would &s;pare many from becoming the victims of folly and caprice." Such in&s;tances of &s;implicity and candour are &s;eldom to be met with.</P>
<P>I am equally charmed with the charac|ters of the parent and the child. I am affected at their lo&s;s, and feel a tender &s;ympathy for them.</P>
<P>How happy would it be for the world, if parents in general adopted Mr. Elmer's plan! By in&s;tilling principles of virtue in|to the mind of his child, he laid a foun|dation for confidence, and converted that duty to a privilege, which to a mind
<PB N="56" REF="030397_0054_0FE6C5DD08D6B5E8">otherwi&s;e educated would have appeared a ta&s;k. Heaven certainly de&s;igned him for a being of a &s;uperior order: he knew how to combine the father and the friend; and, in&s;tead of acting the tyrant where he had power, he generou&s;ly di&s;dained to op|pre&s;s humanity. Yes, Matilda, I feel a high veneration for tho&s;e characters, who can boldly &s;tep out of the common track, and bid defiance to the prejudices of man|kind, by facilitating the happine&s;s even of a child.</P>
<P>How are the regi&s;ters of marriage con|verted into monuments of di&s;grace! See the parties mo&s;t intimately concerned &s;tanding like a bea&s;t&mdash;neuter. The mi&s;er and the proud &s;ire contract, while the poor victims remain pa&s;&s;ive; and at la&s;t, to ap|pea&s;e the craving appetites of pride, are obliged to &s;ubmit to mi&s;ery and di&s;grace, or, in &s;eeking an a&s;ylum of peace, be abandoned to poverty and wretchedne&s;s. O humanity, how art thou fallen from thy original purity!</P>
<P>In&s;tances of depravity are common in this city. We generally vi&s;it the Pump-room, where he company re&s;ort, every
<PB N="57" REF="030397_0055_0FE6C5E4F8C55B10">morning. Here we are pre&s;ented with a group of figures that at once excite pity and contempt. You can hardly conceive the contra&s;ts that alternately appear be|fore us.</P>
<P>The old and decrepit libertine, unable to &s;upport his &s;teps only a few paces, is obliged to be wheeled in a chair. His countenance is a picture of debauchery; and you may ob&s;erve, amid&s;t all the di&s;|tortions of his features, a de&s;ire to repair the emaciated injuries which his con&s;titu|tion has &s;u&s;tained.</P>
<P>The aged female tottering with infir|mity, though convinced that &s;he is ha&s;ten|ing to her exit, would fain deceive her&s;elf and the world with re&s;pect to the date of her exi&s;tence: &s;he daubs her venerable locks, the colour of which, to a virtuous mind, would reflect an honour and a com|fort, and decks her&s;elf in all the gaudy trap|pings of fa&s;hion; and were it not for tho&s;e unavoidable wrinkles which furrow her brow, and the reeling of her fabric, &s;carce able to &s;upport it&s;elf again&s;t a puff of wind, one would be at a lo&s;s to di&s;tingui&s;h the young and the giddy, from tho&s;e who are ju&s;t ready to &s;tep into the grave.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="030397_0056_0FE6C5E50C163530">
Here the proud coxcomb, whom folly and di&s;&s;ipation have reduced almo&s;t to a &s;tate of dependence, dreads the mo&s;t di&s;|tant idea of poverty, and, like a bird of prey, watches an impetuous moment when he may ru&s;h on the unwary woman, who, by rein&s;tating him in his former po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, too often becomes the partner of his di&s;|grace, with a certain pro&s;pect of mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>Many, too, are the unthinking girls who&s;e happine&s;s centres in flirting about with fops. Aiming to gain the a&s;cendancy over their gallants, they lay a&s;ide the mod|e&s;t veil of delicacy. This affords them only a temporary triumph. At length, mortified by &s;ucce&s;&s;ive di&s;appointment and vexation, they de&s;cend to be the dupes of their own folly, and finally &s;well the annals of infamy.</P>
<P>But you will &s;ay, Are there no charac|ters that de&s;erve a more plea&s;ing de&s;crip|tion?&mdash;Yes, my dear, there are. Here you may &s;ee blended in one, the fair, the gentle, and the amiable&mdash;here the wi&s;e and the prudent&mdash;and here al&s;o the un|fortunate. An in&s;tance of the latter de|&s;cription I will give you.</P>

I was one day walking in the fields, con|templating the beauties of nature, when I &s;aw, &s;eated on a bank under a hedge, a female. Her appearance was pen&s;ive and dejected. I approached her, to con|vince my&s;elf of her &s;ituation. To my &s;urpri&s;e, I beheld a countenance beauti|fully delicate; and though time had given her clothes the marks of poverty, yet it was evident &s;he was a being above the common ranks of &s;ociety. I felt my&s;elf intere&s;ted in her favour. She ob&s;erved me drawing near her, and in all probabil|ity, had I not quickened my pace, would have concealed her di&s;tre&s;s &s;ome time longer.</P>
<P>I endeavoured to appear as cheerful as my feelings would admit, and prudence forbad my inquiring abruptly into the cau&s;e of her di&s;tre&s;s; I therefore a&s;ked her the way to a neighbouring village. She replied with an accent that at once convinced me of my &s;u&s;picions,</P>

'From what part then did you come?' &s;aid I with a &s;mile. She blu&s;hed, and a torrent of tears &s;treamed from her eyes, when &s;he &s;aintly &s;aid,</P>
<P>'I am an unfortunate woman, early exiled from my friends and my&s;elf; but perhaps it were better to hide my misfor|tunes than&mdash;'</P>

<P>'Can you feel then for di&s;tre&s;s?' &s;aid &s;he.</P>
<P>'I can not only feel, but I can be happy al&s;o in being the friend of virtue, and in relieving di&s;tre&s;s. Tell me by what means you are de&s;erted by your friends, and I will endeavour to&mdash;'</P>
<P>'Impo&s;&s;ible, Madam; endeavours will be fruitle&s;s. I, perhaps, &s;hall be con&s;id|ered the aggre&s;&s;or, by fir&s;t de&s;erting them; nor do I wi&s;h to return, till the arbitrary feelings of a mother be reduced to tho&s;e of a friend.'</P>
<P>A mother! Is it po&s;&s;ible that a mother can act the tyrant to &s;uch exce&s;s, as to oblige her daughter to fly from her
<PB N="61" REF="030397_0059_0FE6C5ED835B8EE0">pre&s;ence? By what motives was &s;he ac|tuated?'</P>
<P>'By pride and avarice, Madam. As you &s;eem to be intere&s;ted in my di&s;tre&s;s, I will entru&s;t you with my hi&s;tory. I need not de&s;cend into all the particulars re&s;pecting my parents. It will be &s;uffi|cient to inform you, that I was born in Birmingham.</P>
<P>'My father was concerned in a capital manufactory, and acquired a con&s;iderable fortune by his a&s;&s;iduity. He died in the prime of life, leaving my mother &s;ole ex|ecutrix. And though I was, of four children, the only one that &s;urvived, yet &s;he felt her&s;elf happy in re&s;igning me to the care of a maiden aunt; who, fearing my morals would be either extirpated or corrupted, reque&s;ted as a favour to have me for a companion.</P>
<P>'My mother was as much plea&s;ed at the idea of being relieved from &s;o much trouble, as my aunt was at re&s;cuing the daughter of her brother from certain ruin. I am &s;orry to &s;ay, that the former always delighted more in di&s;&s;ipation and fa&s;hion|able amu&s;ements, than in tho&s;e dome&s;tic
<PB N="62" REF="030397_0060_0FE6C5ED917763C8">concerns which ornament the character of a woman.</P>
<P>'My aunt's general employment was in&s;tructing me in relative duties; nor did &s;he exempt me from tho&s;e accompli&s;h|ments which with prudence are &s;o beau|tifully attracting in our &s;ex. She care|fully endeavoured to encourage &s;uch principles of virtue in my young mind, as &s;he thought would be nece&s;&s;ary to guard me from error.</P>
<P>'At length I was attended by &s;everal young &s;uitors. Age and education had &s;o far matured my under&s;tanding, as to make me prefer the virtuous mind, even though his fortune were contracted, to the man who had habituated him&s;elf to vice. My good aunt approved of my choice; and the &s;anction of my mother only remained to complete my wi&s;hes.</P>
<P>'The addre&s;&s;es of one gentleman, who had a fortune even beyond my expecta|tion, but who&s;e character and conduct had equally rendered him di&s;agreeable&punc; I refu&s;ed. In&s;tead of receiving my an&s;wer as po&s;itive, he immediately ha&s;tened to my mother; thinking that by an offer of
<PB N="63" REF="030397_0061_0FE6C5EEA5676C98">a &s;plendid &s;ettlement he &s;hould ea&s;ily over|come by force, what would be otherwi&s;e inacce&s;&s;ible; and when Mr. Williams, for whom I was partial, applied for the &s;ame favour, he was rejected with con|tempt, and informed, that her daughter had already an admirer more &s;uited to her birth and fortune.</P>
<P>'In a few days I was &s;ummoned to appear before her; and, to my &s;urpri&s;e, was informed that &s;he had given her con|&s;ent to Mr. Green to wait on me, at the &s;ame time prai&s;ing him for his per&s;onal ac|compli&s;hments, and reminding me of the advantages of his &s;uperior fortune; tell|ing me that &s;he expected I would receive his addre&s;&s;es without any he&s;itation.</P>
<P>'I could no longer be &s;ilent; I there|fore told her, I was exceedingly &s;orry that it was not in my power to comply with her wi&s;hes&mdash;for I had conceived a &s;ettled di&s;like to his per&s;on as well as to his char|acter; and that I mu&s;t beg leave to decline the favour &s;he had intended me. At this &s;he threw her&s;elf into a mo&s;t violent pa&s;|&s;ion&mdash;wondering at my ta&s;te&mdash;and threat|ening to de&s;ert me if I did not immediate|ly
<PB N="64" REF="030397_0062_0FE6C5EEB4458FB0">con&s;ent to his propo&s;als.

<P>I DID not intend, my dear, to deprive you of the remaining part of the unfortunate Mi&s;s Blair's hi&s;tory. You have now her continuation. After a &s;hort pau&s;e &s;he related as follows:</P>
<P>'I was di&s;tracted with the heap of mi&s;|fortunes that attended me. To add to the re&s;t&mdash;the next day, before I had re|covered
<PB N="67" REF="030397_0065_0FE6C5F78C643208">my &s;hock, I was mortified by the appearance of Mr. Green. His manner appeared more di&s;gu&s;ting than ever. He began by informing me of his &s;ucce&s;s with my mother. I interrupted him, and beg|ged him at lea&s;t to be &s;ilent for the pre&s;ent on the &s;ubject, as my mind was &s;ufficiently agitated by the affliction that had &s;o re|cently befallen me. After a few inquiries he left me, and promi&s;ed to wait on me again at a more convenient &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>'I was now obliged to attend to the la&s;t duties Lowed my aunt, before I could obey my mother's mandate. You will, perhaps, wonder that my aunt did not provide for me before &s;he died; but this was impo&s;&s;i|ble, as her e&s;tate, which was but &s;mall, became the property of my cou&s;in, the next heir at law. She left me all that &s;he could; which amounted in value to about four hundred pounds, including her clothes and furniture. As &s;oon as I had depo&s;ited her remains, I ha&s;tened to my mother. She &s;uffered me to live in peace a week; when &s;he informed me, Mr. Green had &s;ent a card to acquaint us, that he intended waiting on us in the afternoon,
<PB N="68" REF="030397_0066_0FE6C5F7A0DEB410">and de&s;ired me to conduct my&s;elf towards him as though I approved of his &s;uit.</P>
<P>'I told her, it was impo&s;&s;ible; that I could by no means accept of him. She replied, that in a few days &s;he would &s;ee the ceremony performed; otherwi&s;e I mu&s;t quit her pre&s;ence, nay, her hou&s;e. The latter I preferred, rather than become a legal pro&s;titute. I was convinced, in &s;uch a connexion I could not do ju&s;tice to my own feelings in the character of a wife, nor to him as my hu&s;band.</P>
<P>'My mother previou&s;ly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed her&s;elf of nearly all my clothes, and I had only about fifty pounds left: it did not, how|ever, deter me from my de&s;ign. I have wandered the&s;e &s;ix months, my little trea&s;|ure is nearly exhau&s;ted, and I am at la&s;t arrived at the pitiful condition in which you &s;ee me.'</P>
<P>I then a&s;ked her if I &s;hould write to her mother, and endeavour to &s;often her heart by argument. She con&s;ented to my pro|po&s;al. I immediately took her home to our lodgings, and made her as comforta|ble as I could. The gratitude &s;he di&s;cov|ered at my little attentions increa&s;ed my ardour.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="030397_0067_0FE6C5FD813EF458">
I wrote to her mother; and in four days had a letter to inform me, that &s;he was on the point of death, and only wi&s;h|ed to &s;ee her daughter, that &s;he might confe&s;s the injuries &s;he had done her, and receive her forgivene&s;s; that Mr. Green had died a mi&s;erable victim to vice; and that a letter had been received from Mr. Williams, who was in the We&s;t Indies, but was expected &s;oon to return. This Ac|count I read to her; and &s;uch was the filial tenderne&s;s of her heart, that &s;he immedi|ately &s;wooned away. When &s;he recover|ed her&s;elf, &s;he appeared in a kind of fren|zy at the idea of her mother's death. I procured her every medical a&s;&s;i&s;tance that was nece&s;&s;ary; and when &s;he was able to bear the journey, a&s;&s;i&s;ted her with my pur&s;e.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Blair had only left us a week be|fore I had a letter from her, written in &s;uch a &s;tyle, that I now con&s;ider her ac|quaintance as an acqui&s;ition rarely to be met with. After reciting the death of her mother, with the di&s;agreeable incidents attending it, &s;he concludes,</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="030397_0068_0FE6C5FD8F3E1D68">
'I &s;hould charge my&s;elf with ingrati|tude, were I not to acknowledge your kind interpo&s;ition, when I was &s;inking under a weight of ob&s;curity and di&s;tre&s;s: the rug|ged hand of poverty had nearly deranged my animal &s;y&s;tem. To whom am I in|debted? to whom can I make a return? I know the genero&s;ity of your nature, nor will I di&s;turb it. You feel a recompen&s;e within that &s;prings from a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of doing good: this is all you wi&s;h. I confe&s;s I am happy in claiming a friend|ship with a per&s;on who can delight in be|ing the friend of the oppre&s;&s;ed. My heart dictates more&mdash;but the unhappy cir|cum&s;tances that now attend me forbid it. The death of my mother is a &s;hock to my feelings. I can forget the injuries I receiv|ed from her hand, and hide them under the weakne&s;s of humanity. You will not wait for invitations, but come and &s;ee me when you can make it convenient.&mdash; Adieu, &amp;c.'</P>
<P>The la&s;t accounts I received of this ami|able woman were, that Mr. Williams was arrived from abroad, and that they expect|ed &s;oon to be married.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="030397_0069_0FE6C5FFBA50DD10">
What a contra&s;t do the characters of Mrs. An&s;ell's father, and of the mother whom I have de&s;cribed, pre&s;ent! The for|mer con&s;idered his child had an equal right to the privileges of humanity with him&s;elf; but the latter, poor woman! never gave her&s;elf the trouble to think. She conclud|ed, that the idea of parent was in&s;eparable from u&s;urpation and tyranny; and that peace of mind was only a &s;mall compen&s;a|tion for wealth and titles. In the&s;e, how|ever, &s;he was unfortunately deceived, and no arguments were ever forcible enough to controvert her mi&s;taken ideas, till the near approach of death removed the veil from her bewildered &s;en&s;es. Then it is, in gen|eral, that the human mind begins to feel the importance of truth and equity, and confe&s;s them &s;uperior in quality to fa&s;h|ionable and di&s;&s;ipated notions. How ill calculated was Mrs. Blair for either wife or mother! She di&s;covered a very con|tracted mind, with little education, or le&s;s of its good effects.</P>

<P>REALLY, my dear Loui&s;a, you have acquitted your&s;elf admirably. I return you a thou&s;and thanks for your tale, and &s;hould be happy in a per&s;onal acquaintance with Mi&s;s Blair. I applaud her motives for leaving her mother&mdash; though it was a dangerous experiment. What are not wandering women expo&s;ed to! Many unhappy creatures, by endeav|ouring
<PB N="74" REF="030397_0072_0FE6C6011838B6D0">to avoid one evil, are in&s;en&s;ibly led into &s;nares and temptations which they little &s;u&s;pect. This world is treacherous; and &s;ew females have learned the art of de|fence enough to be always on their guard, when their peaceful hours are likely to be invaded. Inexperienced in the arts of vice them&s;elves, they cannot bear to harbour &s;u&s;picion of others, till at length they are caught in the net, and feel them|&s;elves obliged to bow at the &s;hrine of infa|my. To add to their misfortunes, they are de&s;erted by their neare&s;t friends; and what they &s;ubmitted to in an unguarded moment, they are compelled to continue for a pitiful &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. Lucinda, the daughter of a re&s;pectable citizen, is an eminent in&s;tance of this kind of misfor|tune.</P>
<P>Lucinda had all the advantages that affluence could be&s;tow, at an age when, without a little re&s;traint, it is mo&s;t dan|gerous. She was young, beautiful, and &s;prightly in her imaginations&mdash;but withal virtuous. Her charms attracted a retinue of admirers: each one &s;trove for the con|que&s;t; but all were equally un&s;ucce&s;sful.
<PB N="75" REF="030397_0073_0FE6C604B94FFF40">At length the young Phila&s;ter, who had &s;ome previous knowledge of Lucinda's family, &s;aw her at the play-hou&s;e. He was attracted by the beauty of her per&s;on, and the elegance of her dre&s;s; and being of a genteel appearance, he ea&s;ily introdu|ced him&s;elf to her notice. He was per|fectly ver&s;ed in frivolous conver&s;ation, re|marks on the dre&s;s, &s;cenery, &amp;c. The awkward manner in which &s;he conducted her&s;elf, &s;oon convinced him of the &s;tate of her mind.</P>
<P>When the play was over, he begged leave to attend the young lady and her mother home. The accepted his propo|&s;al; and he had &s;agacity enough to di&s;|cover the further impre&s;&s;ion he had made on the former.</P>
<P>Phila&s;ter was the &s;on of a wealthy knight at the we&s;t end of the town&mdash;but an extravagant libertine&mdash;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of more loquacious &s;en&s;e, than &s;olid virtue. The volubility of his tongue, together with his per&s;onal appearance, were much in his favour; and in a little time he obtain|ed a pa&s;&s;port to the tender heart of Lu|cinda. He was her equal in fortune&mdash;
<PB N="76" REF="030397_0074_0FE6C604CD43BC98">but, owing to an old family di&s;pute, had a difficulty in getting the con&s;ent of par|ents on each &s;ide. Every thing, however, was at length amicably &s;ettled. The time was appointed for the marriage, and the news readily circulated.</P>
<P>Some days before the period arrived, the following note was &s;ent to Lucinda by a young lady, who&s;e fortune was rather contracted, but who&s;e agreeable manners made her beloved by all who had the plea&s;ure of knowing her.</P>
<LETTER LANG="eng">
<HEAD>TO LUCINDA.</HEAD>
<P>"THE news of the day informs me, you are &s;hortly to be united to Phila&s;ter. Be it &s;o&mdash;you are innocent. But feel for me, Madam, when I tell you, that the treachery of the man who is &s;oon to be your hu&s;band has reduced me to &s;hame, has con&s;tituted me wretched. My &s;tate of mind forbids the unfolding my tale of woe: could you know it, you would drop the &s;ympathetic tear. I once anticipated the morn like your&s;elf&mdash;but may you e&s;|cape the mi&s;ery of the unfortunate &mdash;"</P>
</LETTER>
<P><PB N="77" REF="030397_0075_0FE6C60F36EEC650">
Lucinda's father intercepted the above, and in con&s;equence countermanded his former con&s;ent. He made inquiries re|&s;pecting the unfortunate young lady, and found that Phila&s;ter had by promi&s;es &s;edu|ced her, and them de&s;erted her. He pre|&s;ented the note to his daughter, and in|formed her of the particulars he had heard, forbidding her to &s;uffer Phila&s;ter to en|ter her pre&s;ence again, or forfeit his pa|ternal e&s;teem. It did not, however, affect the feelings of the hardened debauchee, nor deter him from villainous purpo&s;es. He had never felt the virtuous influence of love; and in&s;tead of being mortified at the di&s;covery, he con&s;idered it a favoura|ble opportunity to be revenged of a family enemy.</P>
<P>Lucinda, unfortunately, too early in|formed Phila&s;ter of her attachment to him, before &s;he had properly &s;tudied his char|acter or the bent of his inclinations: &s;he had gone too far&mdash;nor would the feelings of her heart permit her to obey her fa|ther's injunction. Fatal love! Unhappy woman! Why did&s;t thou form weapons to appo&s;e thy own peace? Why betray
<PB N="78" REF="030397_0076_0FE6C60F4988EEE8">thy weak credulity, and &s;uffer the mon|&s;ter to increa&s;e in power?</P>
<P>Phila&s;ter found means to get admi&s;&s;ion to her company. He was not at a lo&s;s to ju&s;tify his conduct, nor to reprobate the &s;everity of her father. He made u&s;e of in&s;inuating prote&s;tations, that are too of|ten proof again&s;t rea&s;on. He told her, there was no po&s;&s;ibility of their being ever united but by &s;tealth&mdash;that &s;he mu&s;t elope with him, and depend on his hon|our&mdash;that he &s;hould believe &s;he had no affection for him, unle&s;s &s;he complied im|mediately with his wi&s;hes. This, howev|er, &s;he refu&s;ed&mdash;though with &s;uch a &s;pirit of timidity, that it did not deprive him of the hope of &s;ucceeding in his ba&s;e de&s;ign. He &s;wore to love and con&s;tancy&mdash;painted the horrors to which &s;he mu&s;t expo&s;e him if &s;he per&s;i&s;ted in denying his reque&s;t&mdash;the &s;ea&mdash;the &s;word&mdash;the ball&mdash;with a thou&s;and other terrifying &s;cenes which the humane female trembles at. At la&s;t &s;he thought him &s;incere. Neither the threats of her father, nor the entreaties of her mother, had any weight on her mind. She con&s;ented&mdash;fatal con&s;ent!&mdash;fatal mo|ment!&mdash;&s;he
<PB N="79" REF="030397_0077_0FE6C6105881E530">packed up all her moveables again&s;t the time appointed&mdash;&s;he fled&mdash;and that too with a wretch who had no &s;ooner deprived her of the con&s;olations of virtue, that he retired from her pre&s;ence, and left her a con&s;iderable di&s;tance from home.

<P>In con&s;equence of this unhappy cata&s;|trophe, Lucinda dreaded to return to her parents; &s;he &s;pent all her money; and not till the pinching hand of poverty had
<PB N="80" REF="030397_0078_0FE6C610673356E0">overtaken her did &s;he make know her &s;ituation. The pride of her friends was too great to take a repenting child again to their bo&s;om. She had been guilty of a crime that had di&s;graced her&s;elf and her family, and no pardon was to be ob|tained. A wretched &s;ituation for a &s;en|&s;ible mind!&mdash;Her re&s;ources were entirely &s;topped. Poverty threatened her on one hand, and infamy on the other: to avoid the former, &s;he &s;ubmitted to the latter.</P>
<P>She was &s;oon reduced to tho&s;e unhap|py extremities that attend the mi&s;erable wretches who wander the &s;treets; and ere two months had elap&s;ed, her delicate con&s;titution began to decay. Death &s;tar|ed her in the face. She made it known to her friends.</P>
<P>The idea of death awakened parental tenderne&s;s, and her father ha&s;tened to her lodgings. He entered her mi&s;erable apartment, where he found her &s;urround|ed with a group of wretches&mdash;who, though they were lo&s;t to the common feelings of humanity, yet had &s;en&s;ibility enough to lament her &s;ituation in tears.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="030397_0079_0FE6C6139AF6E888">
She knew his venerable voice, and lifted up her worn-out eye-lids. She &s;aw him approach; and with a &s;hriek, which &s;hook the bed that &s;upported her, &s;he &s;tretched forth her hand, clo&s;ed her eyes, and expired.

<P>"My child, my child! What have I done! Had I taken thee to my bo&s;om, when thou wert fir&s;t &s;educed, I might have prevented thy premature, thy &s;hock|ing end." His repentance, alas! was too late.</P>
<P>An acquaintance who related to me the tale, &s;avoured me with a manu&s;cript of reflections which was found in a box directed to her father. I will tran&s;cribe them for your peru&s;al&mdash;but mu&s;t beg to re&s;erve it for my next. I feel &s;leepy&mdash;a&s;&s;ure your&s;elf I am &s;till</P>

How many females e&s;cape thy puni&s;hment, who are more de&s;erving of it than thy|&s;elf! Many a &s;plendid equipage &s;upports a de&s;picable pro&s;titute, who delights in infamy, but by cunning pre&s;erves her character; and from circum&s;tances un|known, or &s;carcely to be conceived, many deluded creatures are con&s;igned to per|petual di&s;grace. Perhaps they will expe|rience a tran&s;po&s;ition in their feelings hereafter.</P>
<P>Fatal pride, that will not &s;uffer the ex|a&s;perated parent to pardon an unfortunate crime in a child! Though, in a moment of delu&s;ion, her virtue and her rea&s;on for&s;ook her, yet &s;he might have been re&s;|cued from the ruinous con&s;equences that followed. How many of tho&s;e deluded
<PB N="86" REF="030397_0084_0FE6C621F6AAA4E8">wretches might be recovered, were only the hand of pity extended towards them!</P>
<P>The unhappy tale of Lucinda, howev|er, &s;hould be a le&s;&s;on of caution to fe|males, ever to be aware of either too much levity or credulity in their conduct, whil&s;t in the pre&s;ence of the other &s;ex. Nor let the &s;ycophant or the fop&mdash;the &s;ervile or the proud&mdash;nor even the &s;teady&mdash;the brave&mdash;the wi&s;e&mdash;or the prudent, be the &s;ubjects of confidence, till con|vinced of their integrity; but let females remember, that love without rea&s;on is dangerous.</P>
<P>Happy are tho&s;e who are out of the reach of temptation! Let them not tri|umph. Had they been expo&s;ed alike with the unfortunate, their fate, perhaps, would have involved them in the &s;ame calamities. Nor have tho&s;e who re&s;i&s;t the power of temptation a right to exult, &s;ince, were it their rea&s;on, education, or religion, that prevented them from becom|ing victims, they are indebted to &s;ome|thing more than humanity for the&s;e in|e&s;timable ble&s;&s;ings.</P>

<P>We have at la&s;t, my dear, com|plied with the entreaties of our kind friends Mr. and Mrs. An&s;ell, and are ar|rived at this man&s;ion of bli&s;s. Really,
<PB N="89" REF="030397_0087_0FE6C62AB9024CA0">Loui&s;a, you would be delighted if you could imagine the extent of their conju|gal happine&s;s. Nature her&s;elf &s;eems am|bitious to add to their felicity.</P>
<P>The &s;ituation of the hou&s;e is beautiful beyond conception: a ri&s;ing hill which commands an exten&s;ive pro&s;pect over the &s;ea&mdash;a view of the I&s;le of Wight&mdash;and the varying &s;cenes which &s;urround us by land and by &s;ea, make as plea&s;ant an ap|pearance as ever I &s;aw.</P>
<P>In the bottom of yonder dale I &s;ee a le&s;&s;er farm: the pea&s;ant and his family are bu&s;ily employed&mdash;and &s;urely they have enough to excite them to indu&s;try. The field wants the labouring hand to pre&s;erve its cultivation; the cattle depend on their &s;teady care. In the yard are the fowls pecking round the barn; the &s;trag|gling ducks in the pond; the milk-maid milking her cows; and the pigs following the dairy-woman to their trough.</P>
<P>In a further vale I view a lonely cottage &s;urrounded with a &s;mall garden: its poor inhabitant has &s;towed it with vegetables and fruits, and in a corner has placed a few bee-hives: with the&s;e he provides a lit|tle
<PB N="90" REF="030397_0088_0FE6C62ACB5BA378">winter &s;tore, that he may abate the crav|ing appetites of his family, when the rig|our of the &s;ea&s;on prevents his manual ex|erci&s;e, and threatens them with want. A friendly &s;tranger enters the decaying wicket&mdash;he is complimented by a &s;narling cur&mdash;nor dares he approach, till the faith|ful animal is relieved from his tru&s;t by the appearance of his ma&s;ter, or &s;ome of the dome&s;tics.</P>
<P>On one &s;ide is a winding river, with a mill&mdash;on the other, an a&s;cent, in the mid|dle of which is a village church with a &s;pot of ground the receptacle of the dead. There, think I, the hero and the vanqui&s;h|ed have equal claims to di&s;tinction: there the &s;quire has nothing to boa&s;t over his de|pendent tenant: one cannot oppre&s;s, the other has no rea&s;on to murmur. There the philo&s;opher, the divine, and the lib|ertine &s;ink to a common heap; nor can human &s;agacity di&s;tingui&s;h the particles of either. There, tho&s;e whom the &s;miles of Providence have elevated above their fel|lows, re&s;t on the &s;ame mouldering couch with the unfortunate.</P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="030397_0089_0FE6C62BDD058120">
At the top of the a&s;cent are the &s;hatter|ed remains of an an ancient ca&s;tle. At &s;ight of this venerable pile I am lo&s;t in thought. Here the rich and the poor have equally murmured at their hard fate. Misfortunes have followed them alike. How many brave, animated &s;ouls have fallen &s;acrifices in its defence! How many anxious, haple&s;s wives have been deprived of their tender, their endearing hu&s;bands! How many helple&s;s infants have lo&s;t their only &s;upport! How many families have been reduced from poverty to wretchedne&s;s! Ah happier days, that &s;creen the pre&s;ent age from &s;uch woes! Gratitude &s;hould u&s;urp an univer&s;al em|pire in the human heart. Now the &s;trength of the mighty is yielding to the influence of time&mdash;is become a tottering fabric&mdash;But enough.</P>
<P>I believe this &s;cene is calculated to in|&s;pire the mu&s;e. I &s;end the following lines as a continuation, which have flowed from my heart this morning whil&s;t contemplat|ing in an arbour. If I thought you were fond of di&s;covering faults, I would beg you to be favourable in your critici&s;ms.</P>

In addition to the above de&s;cription, our friends have a dear little infant: they unite in telling me it is the &s;weets of mat|rimony. I am ready to believe them, and feel my&s;elf almo&s;t inclined to envy.</P>
<P>How do you think we &s;pend our time? Perhaps it may be called an unfa&s;hionable manner, but I believe you would like it much.</P>
<P>In the morning we ri&s;e about &s;even o'clock, and take a walk, if we have time, in the fields&mdash;otherwi&s;e, in the garden, till eight. After breakfa&s;t, when the du|ties of the family are over, if we have no particular engagement, we again re&s;ume our walk to &s;ome adjacent village, or to vi&s;it one of the lonely cots.</P>
<P>Sometimes we witne&s;s the mo&s;t affecting &s;cenes of poverty and di&s;tre&s;s; and when this is the ca&s;e, our dear friends &s;hew them|&s;elves &s;o very a&s;&s;iduous in le&s;&s;ening afflic|tion, that I begin to think them almo&s;t with|out their equal. They di&s;tribute a cheer|fulne&s;s where ever they go; and the coun|tenances of the poor creatures are &s;o ad|mirably marked with gratitude, that a &s;en|&s;ible mind mu&s;t ever feel it&s;elf amply re|warded
<PB N="94" REF="030397_0092_0FE6C633D90D3158">in admini&s;tering to their nece&s;|&s;ities.</P>
<P>At other times, we have a more plea&s;ing &s;cene. Picture to your&s;elf a group of four, five, or &s;ix children, ri&s;ing in regular gra|dation, and running to the door to meet and welcome us to their ho&s;pitable dwell|ing. Here we are employed a quarter or perhaps half an hour, in inquiring into the conduct and behaviour of each child; that who has the be&s;t character is rewarded with a little book, as a token of approba|tion. By this means each is ambitous to merit the good opinion of Mr. and Mrs. An&s;ell; and it &s;ometimes happens that they have all an equal claim to a pre&s;ent. After vi&s;iting &s;everal of the&s;e cottages of different de&s;criptions, we return home to dinner.</P>
<P>Some mornings we vi&s;it the genteel and re&s;pectable neighbours, and then tho&s;e of the middling rank; for our friends' affa|bility has &s;ecured them the good-will of all.</P>
<P>I ab&s;olutely think that, of every cla&s;s of mankind, to be neither rich nor poor ought to be the mo&s;t preferable, as it is certainly the &s;ituation wherein the human
<PB N="95" REF="030397_0093_0FE6C63536705EF0">mind is mo&s;t capable of enjoyment. The&s;e are the people, who, in general, know the &s;tate of their finances, and the extent of their abilities. And though they cannot boa&s;t of &s;plendid equipages or glittering liveries, yet they have enough to &s;ecure them from the inroads of poverty, or to prevent their being perpetually hara&s;&s;ed by mercenary creditors. Neither extreme to corrode the peace of their bo&s;oms, how thankfully happy ought they to be!&mdash;and yet, alas! how little gratitude is to be &s;een even among them!</P>
<P>We were a few evenings &s;ince at a concert of vocal and in&s;trumental mu&s;ic; where, among a variety of other company, I ob&s;erved two young ladies, who appeared to be &s;i&s;ters; and having a little phy&s;iogn|omical &s;kill, I concluded their di&s;po&s;itions were oppo&s;ite. One of them, whom I &s;uppo&s;ed to be the elde&s;t, was of a &s;our, moro&s;e countenance; &s;he had a brow of contempt, a &s;atirical grin, and a conceit|ed &s;mile. The other had an open coun|tenance, which rather attracted admira|tion.
<PB N="96" REF="030397_0094_0FE6C6354AD715E0">My notice, however, was &s;oon tran&s;|ferred from them to the mu&s;ic; but I de|termined when I returned, if po&s;&s;ible, to make my&s;elf acquainted who they were.</P>
<P>When we are at home, if we have no company, our evenings are employed with the needle. Mr. An&s;ell &s;ometimes reads, of el&s;e we divert our&s;elves with tales. I thought it therefore a favourable oppor|tunity to make my inquiries re&s;pecting the two young ladies I had &s;een at the concert, and of whom I had formed my opinion. Mr. An&s;ell thanked me for the honour I had done him; though he confe&s;&s;ed it was rather an unplea&s;ing ta&s;k to analyze living characters; but as he had a per|&s;onal acquaintance with them, he would endeavour to be impartial in his &s;ketches. He continued thus:</P>
<P>"The names of the ladies you allude to, are Caroline and Sabina. They are daughters of a gentleman who died about fifteen years ago in the neighbourhood; their mother being previou&s;ly dead. Their father was of a proud, imperious di&s;po&s;i|tion, a de&s;pot to all who were nece&s;&s;itated to bend to his power; but their mother
<PB N="97" REF="030397_0095_0FE6C63D6320DFC8">was univer&s;ally beloved and re&s;pected for her amiable manners.</P>
<P>"Caroline and Sabina were left or|phans, when the age of the elde&s;t did not exceed five years, with a fortune of 10,000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> each, under the direction of guardians. It was ea&s;y to di&s;cern even from infancy a contra&s;t in their di&s;po|&s;itions.</P>
<P>"They had an education &s;uited to a &s;uperior rank. All the polite accompli&s;h|ments that could po&s;&s;ibly ornament the &s;ex, they were made acquainted with. But natural inclinations, unfortunately, too often are not to be governed by the&s;e. It is indeed po&s;&s;ible for the mind that has received the poli&s;h of education, to be more ea&s;ily convinced of error than the uncultivated; but it is frequently diffi|cult to regulate actions by moral impre&s;|&s;ions. So it is with Sabina, whom you thought to be the elde&s;t of the two, but who in fact is the younge&s;t. With her exi&s;tence &s;he &s;eems to have received the principles of her father; &s;he is vain enough to believe every one beneath her. It is true, &s;he has a fine per&s;on; but her
<PB N="98" REF="030397_0096_0FE6C63D711B2EA8">unhappy temper having habituated her to di&s;tort her features, that which im|perceptibly &s;tole on her from pride, will never, I fear, for&s;ake her, till the cold hand of death &s;hall di&s;play its irre&s;i&s;tible power.</P>
<P>"If you happen to be in her company, &s;he is ince&s;&s;antly engro&s;&s;ing the conver&s;a|tion to her&s;elf; her lap-dog is a favourite topic; and if you chance to be heedle&s;s of her frivolous chat, &s;he &s;eels her&s;elf mortified; her countenance becomes the tran&s;cript of her mind; &s;he gives you a &s;ullen contemptuous look, and often will flirt out of the room.</P>
<P>"Sabina is now about nineteen years of age. She has had &s;everal admirers of her per&s;on; but as &s;oon as they have penetrated a little into her mind, they feel them&s;elves di&s;gu&s;ted, and for&s;ake her with ridicule. It is true, &s;he has had one gentleman, who would have made a &s;acrifice of him&s;elf if &s;he had only accept|ed him. It was a happy di&s;appointment, could he have thought it &s;o; but the in|fatuation which &s;eizes &s;ome minds is &s;o great, that though they were hang over
<PB N="99" REF="030397_0097_0FE6C63ECFCC6730">a dreadful precipice by the mo&s;t brittle thread, yet would they be uncon&s;cious of danger; they would convert fortunate events into unfortunate ones: in &s;hort, nothing but direful circum&s;tances will awaken them from delu&s;ion, and re&s;cue them from mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>"Sabina would often appoint to meet the young Alphon&s;o, and as often di&s;ap|point him; or, to mortify him &s;till more, &s;he would contrive to invite &s;ome other beau, with whom &s;he would be more familiar. At length his patience was ex|hau&s;ted; he &s;aw no hope of ever attaining the &s;ummit of his wi&s;hes; de&s;pair and vex|ation preyed upon his &s;pirits, and a re&s;olu|tion at once big with horror and di&s;grace haunted his imagination. He went one morning to a river, and threw him&s;elf in; but happily &s;ome labourers coming by whil&s;t he was in the &s;truggles of death, prevented the fatal &s;troke: he was to ap|pearance dead, but immediate recour&s;e being had to medical a&s;&s;i&s;tance he recov|ered.</P>
<P>"Sabina was informed of the event: but in&s;tead of being touched with Alphon|&s;o's
<PB N="100" REF="030397_0098_0FE6C63EE0E572A0">misfortunes, &s;he triumphed in her con&s;equence, that &s;he was capable of being the means of &s;o much mi&s;chief.</P>
<P>"Alphon&s;o, when he grew well, perceiv|ed his mi&s;take, and determined never to have any thing more to &s;ay to a woman, who could trifle with his affections, and expo&s;e him to inconceivable pangs. He now &s;aw, that her heart was formed of too har&s;h materials ever to afford him any con&s;olation in the marriage &s;tate. She was not the lovely woman his ha&s;ty imag|ination had formed her. No traits of del|icate &s;entiment could he now di&s;cover in her mind. It is natural to &s;uppo&s;e, that when he reflected on the recent circum &s;tances of his life, his under&s;tanding mu&s;t be &s;hocked. When his frenzy however was &s;ub&s;ided, and rea&s;on re&s;umed her &s;eat in his heart, he again began to turn his thoughts to &s;ocial life, and made choice of an amiable young lady, who was every way qualified to render him happy.</P>
<P>"Sabina is now an object of pity and contempt. Even her &s;ervants are perpet|ually complaining of her unfeeling beha|viour: &s;he treats them as though they
<PB N="101" REF="030397_0099_0FE6C64724E84DA0">were of the animal kind; and if &s;he thinks they are a moment happy and peaceable in them&s;elves, &s;he will hara&s;s them to &s;uch a degree as to deprive them of the lea&s;t en|joyment. She never regards the entrea|ties of the poor, nor turns an eye of pity to the afflicted. She is unhappy in her|&s;elf, nor can &s;he communicate any thing but unhappine&s;s to tho&s;e around her. Her ambition is unbounded: &s;he envies her &s;uperiors, and de&s;pi&s;es her inferiors. If it were not for the gentle Caroline, it is probable &s;he would be utterly for&s;aken by all. This is the character of Sabina; the latene&s;s of hour obliges me to po&s;tpone that of Caroline till another evening."</P>
<P>I mu&s;t follow Mr. An&s;ell, and break off for the pre&s;ent, re&s;erving the character of Caroline for my next. Mr. and Mrs. An&s;ell unite in kind love; I believe the latter will inclo&s;e a few lines when I write again, to beg the favour of you to return this way to London.

<P>THE following evening Mr. An&s;ell favoured us with his continuation of the contra&s;t.</P>
<P>"In the countenance of Caroline," &s;aid he, "you may ob&s;erve an open, gen|erous and cheerful di&s;po&s;ition; from her infancy &s;he has been beloved by all&mdash;even the noble and the beggar unite in her prai&s;e. She does not, like Sabina, intimi|date with a frown, but engages by her amiable &s;miles. I cannot better de&s;cribe her character, than by de&s;cending into &s;ome of her more retired actions, to which I have been witne&s;s.</P>
<P>"I have &s;een her at a&s;&s;emblies and con|certs, where &s;he has univer&s;ally attracted notice: it did not, however, elevate her above her&s;elf: &s;he pre&s;erved a bewitching decorum.</P>
<P>"In her dre&s;s &s;he always di&s;covers &s;im|ple elegance with ta&s;te; in her manners,
<PB N="103" REF="030397_0101_0FE6C64873C7A938">&s;he has ea&s;e unaccompanied with di&s;gu&s;t|ing freedom; and in her conver&s;ation &s;he betrays no affected airs, but plea&s;es without the lea&s;t oftentation. With &s;uch qualifications, you may &s;uppo&s;e that Car|oline po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the admiration of every one.</P>
<P>"Her pur&s;e is ever ready to a&s;&s;i&s;t the poor; and &s;he takes a delight in retiring at intervals from the more bu&s;y and ani|mating &s;cenes of life, to vi&s;it the hou&s;es of poverty and the beds of affliction.</P>
<P>"I once met her at the hut of &s;ome poor old decrepit people, who were hardly able to &s;upport their exi&s;tence, owing to pov|erty, age, and infirmity. She hearkens to their tales of di&s;tre&s;s; and I have &s;een the commi&s;erating tear of &s;ympathy trick|ling down her cheek, while &s;he bold forth her beneficent hand to relieve their wants.</P>
<P>"I a&s;ked her, if &s;he was not afraid of venturing to vi&s;it tho&s;e decayed hou&s;es, as well from their antiquity, as from the danger of catching di&s;orders? to which &s;he replied,</P>
<P>'Shall I be afraid to vi&s;it my fellow mortals, who are formed of the &s;ame ma|terials with my&s;elf? No: I am too well
<PB N="104" REF="030397_0102_0FE6C64886E58890">per&s;uaded that the cau&s;e of humanity is the cau&s;e of God. Were every one to fly from the beds of the afflicted, what would finally become of the whole human race? Can I live in affluence, and &s;ee the poor dying with hunger? Can I &s;ee them linger to their exit, unregarded like brutes, and not turn an eye of pity to|wards them? No: humanity forbids it, my feelings would upbraid me, and rea|&s;on would condemn me for not being more attentive to its dictates.'</P>
<P>"A &s;ingular in&s;tance has lately come to my knowledge, which eminently di&s;|tingui&s;hes Caroline's compa&s;&s;ionate ten|derne&s;s. A poor man came from a neigh|bouring pari&s;h to that in which &s;he lives, becau&s;e it was more contiguous to his em|ployment. He brought with him his fa|mily, which con&s;i&s;ted of his wife and three children, and provided a &s;mall hou&s;e (or rather hovel) for their reception. They lived in the greate&s;t harmony and affection, and &s;upported them&s;elves as comfortably as it was po&s;&s;ible, out of the little pittance from their joint labour, which &s;eldom ex|ceeded ten &s;hillings a week. The family
<PB N="105" REF="030397_0103_0FE6C64F560B4B98">was increa&s;ing; the poor woman was very far advanced in pregnancy. Of this the over&s;eers had information; and fearing they would become burthen&s;ome to the pari&s;h, came and per&s;ecuted them in the mo&s;t unju&s;tifiable manner&mdash;contrary to every &s;entiment of humanity, and in op|po&s;ition to the &s;acred principles of relig|ion; and in&s;i&s;ted on their leaving the pari&s;h in four days.</P>
<P>"As their little man&s;ion was not of con&s;equence enough to con&s;titute them pari&s;hioners, they had no other choice than to leave the pari&s;h quietly, or to be forcibly dragged like &s;laves or criminals in a cart.</P>
<P>"The good man endeavoured to get his former habitation again, but it had been newly occupied &s;ince he had left it; nor could he meet with a place to &s;helter him&s;elf and family from the weather, in his native pari&s;h. The&s;e unfortunate cir|cum&s;tances had &s;o great an effect on the mind of his wife, that it brought on a pre|mature labour, and had nearly been the means of depriving her helple&s;s infants of a mother's care.</P>

"The amiable Caroline, hearing of the di&s;a&s;ters which had happened to this in|du&s;trious family, fled immediately to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance. She inquired into the partic|ulars; and finding the over&s;eers were the in&s;truments of their mi&s;ery, hurried away to them. She charged them in the mo&s;t delicate manner with inhumanity, painted the di&s;tre&s;s in which they had involved the poor victims of their di&s;plea&s;ure, and rep|robated their conduct in the mo&s;t &s;evere manner. She told them, that from their indu&s;try; there was no pro&s;pect of their becoming burthen&s;ome; and that &s;uch a circum&s;tance ought to have had a little more weight on their minds, and to have encouraged them to lenity.</P>
<P>"By the feeling manner with which &s;he &s;poke, &s;he convinced them that they had done wrong, and they promi&s;ed to permit the poor creatures to remain un|mole&s;ted till the woman was recovered. Caroline di&s;dained their terms, and told them &s;he would become their &s;ecurity.</P>
<P>"She fled again to the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed family, and left them a little money, that they might provide what nece&s;&s;ary comforts
<PB N="107" REF="030397_0105_0FE6C6519461FCB0">the poor woman &s;tood in need of; then ha&s;tened home, and &s;ent &s;ome food for the helple&s;s babes. As &s;oon as they were recovered from this melancholy affliction, Caroline &s;ought a better employment for them. She put them in a &s;mall &s;hop, and collected a &s;um of money; to which &s;he added a loan of twenty pounds, which they were to repay if they &s;ucceeded. With the&s;e helps they purcha&s;ed a &s;tock of goods in the grocery line; from which they had a comfortable &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, and were &s;oon enabled to pay the loan of their kind benefactre&s;s.</P>
<P>"Their hou&s;e now con&s;tituted them pari&s;hioners; and in&s;tead of becoming a burthen them&s;elves, they contributed to the &s;upport of tho&s;e who were already burthen&s;ome. Pro&s;perity attended them in all their undertakings&mdash;and they con|tinued to manife&s;t gratitude and affection to the per&s;on who was the in&s;trument of rai&s;ing them from indigence to comfort.</P>
<P>"Thus we have rea&s;on to believe, that many poor creatures who are now &s;tarving with poverty and oppre&s;&s;ion, many who are treated with deri&s;ion and contempt
<PB N="108" REF="030397_0106_0FE6C651A31EB130">by tho&s;e who are a &s;tep or two above them, if the &s;miles of fortune and provi|dence attended them, would move in a &s;phere very different from that in which they now are, and would become &s;hining ornaments to &s;ociety.</P>
<P>"To the benevolence of Caroline may be added her di&s;tingui&s;hed piety. How amiable does a character appear when ornamented with the&s;e united graces! Where the human mind is thoroughly impre&s;&s;ed with the latter, it will produce eminent in&s;tances of the former; for I maintain, that religion is no more religion, than while it influences to feeling, and charity to fellow creatures in di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>"I think, ladies, you will &s;hare an im|pul&s;e of veneration and affection while I relate an in&s;tance of Caroline's benevolent piety.</P>
<P>"I was entering the hou&s;e of an old woman, who lived about half a mile from ours, was univer&s;ally re&s;pected for her exemplary conduct, and was indebted for her &s;ub&s;i&s;tence to the genero&s;ity of tho&s;e around her; where I heard the echo of a female voice. I had previou&s;ly been in|formed
<PB N="109" REF="030397_0107_0FE6C65A194F33C8">the poor woman was near her end, and made it my bu&s;ine&s;s to go and inquire.</P>
<P>"When I opened the door of the de|cayed apartment, I found the lovely Car|oline in the exerci&s;e of prayer. Ah, me|thought I could have continued days and weeks a &s;pectator of &s;uch devotion; and I think I &s;hall ever remember a &s;entence or two which dropped from her lips.</P>
<P>'&mdash; O thou Eternal Father of the wide Univer&s;e! thou Supreme Judge and Everla&s;ting King! who reigne&s;t through the va&s;t expan&s;e of eternal ages&mdash;who can&s;t call millions and millions of angels to manife&s;t thine unparalleled &s;plendor at the twinkling of an eye!&mdash;Thou to whom kings mu&s;t yield obedience, and princes bow their knees!&mdash;Thou, who had the command of univer&s;al empire, can&s;t di&s;|po&s;e of kingdoms at thy plea&s;ure, and art not to be controlled by the wi&s;dom of &s;enators!&mdash;&s;hall we dare to approach thy cele&s;tial Maje&s;ty? &s;hall we dare to celebrate thy prai&s;e with our feeble tongues, or to a&s;k a ble&s;&s;ing at thy hands? Is it po&s;&s;ible that thou, who can&s;t &s;carcely behold pu|rity in the inhabitants of heaven, &s;hould&s;t
<PB N="110" REF="030397_0108_0FE6C65A2742CBE8">conde&s;cend to the infirmities of mortality? Yes, Lord, thou ha&s;t &s;aid it! The rich and the poor are equal in thine e&s;timation&mdash;Oh! do thou look down on thy poor worm, teach her to be re&s;igned to thy wi&s;dom, animate her &s;oul with &s;ublime pro&s;pects, and, whether &s;he lives or dies, may &s;he be happy, &amp;c.&mdash;'</P>
<P>"The poor afflicted woman heard her with &s;ilent ec&s;tacy&mdash;her &s;oul &s;eemed to be carried to the &s;ummit of glorious immor|tality, contemplating the goodne&s;s of God, and cheerful in the hope of happine&s;s. She took Caroline's hand, and bathed it with grateful tears&mdash;acknowledged the many favours &s;he had received, and expir|ed while &s;he was uttering her ble&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>"To &s;ervants, Caroline is kind and gentle. They all &s;eem plea&s;ed when &s;he is happy, and affected if &s;he is otherwi&s;e. What a contra&s;t in the characters of the two &s;i&s;ters! One is hated and rejected for her pride&mdash;the other beloved and courted for her conde&s;cen&s;ion, affability and kindne&s;s.</P>
<P>"Caroline is now admired by a young gentleman of con&s;iderable property. He
<PB N="111" REF="030397_0109_0FE6C65B4ED61498">is delighted with her charms, and promi&s;es a great addition to her happine&s;s. I have given them both, together with Sabina, an invitation to our hou&s;e to &s;pend the evening, early in next week; you will then, ladies, be able to form your own opinion of them."</P>
<P>Here Mr. An&s;ell fini&s;hed his de&s;cription of the young ladies. I believe I &s;hall wait till I have a per&s;onal interview with them, before I &s;end you the&s;e lines. I &s;hall then, perhaps, give you a further account.</P>

<P>Caroline and Sabina, and the gentle|man who admires the former, have been with us; we have &s;pent a very agreeable evening together, owing to the polite be|haviour of Mr. Milward and the plea&s;ing manner of Caroline. Of Sabina I mu&s;t &s;u&s;pend my judgment, allowing the pic|ture

<P>Mr. Milward is a man of con&s;iderable abilities, and, I think, a very &s;uitable com|panion for the amiable Caroline: integ|rity is the characteri&s;tic of his counte|nance.

<P>My fears are realized! The benevolent, the kind, the attracting Caroline is gone forever. She is gone to the regions of immortal bli&s;s. She is fled to receive eternal honours. My heart bleeds for the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Milward. He is incon&s;olable. It is thought he will not long &s;urvive her.</P>
</LETTER>
<P><PB N="114" REF="030397_0112_0FE6C664ECFB07A8">
Mr. and Mrs. An&s;ell are returned. Gloom is painted in every feature. We all drop tears, tho&s;e &s;ilent tokens of grief, at their recital. Oh! Loui&s;a, your con|ception will be deficient for the &s;cene. My pen is inadequate to the ta&s;k.</P>
<P>"At intervals (&s;aid Mrs. An&s;ell) Car|oline was perfectly &s;en&s;ible. She called for her beloved Milward; and when he ap|proached, &s;he pre&s;&s;ed his hand, and begged him to be compo&s;ed; and when &s;he &s;aw the agonies of his mind, &s;he continued:</P>
<P>'My deare&s;t Friend, I have, perhaps, too much indulged my&s;elf with the plea&s;|ing hopes of being happy in your affec|tions: but 'tis now time to bid adieu to the&s;e fa&s;cinating charms. I am per&s;uaded it cannot be long ere I leave you, and re|tire to yonder world: but till I &s;ee you calm, I cannot yield to the fatal &s;troke with Chri&s;tian dignity. Do not di&s;turb my la&s;t moments. I carry my affection for you to the grave; and I hope to unite with you where we can never part. The eternal goodne&s;s of God decreed this &s;eeming calamity for wi&s;e and better pur|po&s;es. It is our duty mutually to &s;ubmit
<PB N="115" REF="030397_0113_0FE6C66602CF8738">without a murmur to the great demands of Omnipotence. 'Tis he that gave, or ra|ther lent us life: he has a right to di&s;po&s;e of us as he plea&s;es, and a claim to our implicit obedience. Be virtuous, my dear Milward! Let piety di&s;tingui&s;h your con|duct. Remember, that virtue will have its own reward. You will feel tho&s;e con|&s;olations in the hour of departure, which can be derived from no other &s;ource. Let the poor be objects of your concern: &s;uccour them in their di&s;tre&s;s, and en|deavour to abate their oppre&s;&s;ions.'</P>
<P>"She again pre&s;&s;ed his hand; and while they were exchanging the parting ki&s;s, &s;he faintly articulated,</P>
<P>'Farewel! Be comforted, and a&s;&s;ure your&s;elf you will find many friends; I hope, &s;ome too who will be able to miti|gate your &s;orrows, and &s;upply your lo&s;s. Adieu!'</P>
<P>Mr. Milward was too much agitated to make any reply. We perceived it was more than his &s;pirits could &s;upport. He was accordingly prevailed on by Mr. An|&s;ell to leave the room. When he came to the door, he looked back, and then
<PB N="116" REF="030397_0114_0FE6C6661208DDF8">ha&s;tened again to her bed-&s;ide. He gaz|ed with fearful eyes on the expiring object of his faithful love&mdash;&s;tole a few more ten|der embraces, and retired with reluctance from her pre&s;ence. How heart-rending was this &s;cene! Before he had reached another apartment in the hou&s;e, he &s;ighed with violence, and then gave vent to his grief by fainting away. In this in&s;en&s;ible &s;tate he remained a con&s;iderable time. Surely this was unaffected &s;orrow!</P>
<P>The dying Caroline took an affec|tionate leave of tho&s;e around her: &s;he &s;poke tenderly to her &s;i&s;ter&mdash;and when &s;he had recommended us all to the merci|ful kindne&s;s of that God in whom &s;he had repeatedly tru&s;ted, &s;he became a lifele&s;s cor&s;e, and fled beyond pain or &s;orrow. Thus ended the days of an amiable young woman, one who lived as &s;he died&mdash;pious in her life, and re&s;igned in her death&mdash;univer&s;ally beloved, and as univer&s;ally &s;orrowed after.</P>
<P>"The village is already become a &s;pec|tacle of di&s;tre&s;s. Countenances which were once lively, betray inward dejection. Every aged furrow enfolds bitter angui&s;h.
<PB N="117" REF="030397_0115_0FE6C66F869B5478">Tho&s;e who have enjoyed the &s;weets of her friend&s;hip, and tho&s;e who have &s;hared her beneficence, are drooping with de&s;|pair. The tears which have fallen on this occa&s;ion have &s;pread a dimne&s;s on the eyes of all, in&s;omuch that the beauties of &s;pring have no charms&mdash;the fields are become di&s;coloured. The tuneful birds &s;eem to have forgot their cheerful notes&mdash;nor have all the united &s;cenes of nature enough to lull the aching hearts to re|po&s;e" Here Mrs. An&s;ell cea&s;ed.</P>
<P>Thus, Loui&s;a, I have been faithful in penning, as far as my recollection will per|mit, the whole of this affecting event. A young woman in the bloom of life, animat|ed with a pro&s;pect of a happy connexion, is of a &s;udden taken off, and the haple&s;s lover deprived of the plea&s;ures he &s;o fond|ly &s;ought after. But there is a con&s;olation left; &s;he was prepared for either life or death. In both &s;he evinced her virtue and her piety; and I think tho&s;e only who are fit to live, can be fit to die. It &s;hould teach us never to be too anxiou&s;ly concerned for the things of time. Pro&s;|perity
<PB N="118" REF="030397_0116_0FE6C66F94996C18">and adver&s;ity are alike fluctuating. Virtue it&s;elf cannot boa&s;t of a power to re&s;i&s;t the cold impul&s;e of death; and vice is too feeble to fly from its impre&s;s. Youth is not &s;uperior to age: each mu&s;t &s;ubmit, each mu&s;t die.</P>
<P>I need not &s;ay more to excite your &s;en|&s;ibility. Already fancy has painted Loui&s;a bedewing my letter with tears while &s;he reads the melancholy tale: indeed we have all &s;ought relief by this means. Mrs. An&s;ell intends writing a few lines to-mor|row, according to her promi&s;e; but it will be by way of po&s;t&s;cript to what I have already written: for the pre&s;ent, they both join with my mother in kind re&s;pects to your father, and love to your&s;elf.</P>

<P>SINCE I received your la&s;t, we have thought proper to vi&s;it this place: the variegated hue which Spring affords, invited us to partake of her &s;weets by ex|tending our travels.</P>
<P>But ere I go farther, I &s;hould inform you, that &s;ince I wrote to Mrs. An&s;ell, I have laid her kind invitation before my father, and pre&s;&s;ed him to accept of it, as
<PB N="122" REF="030397_0120_0FE6C6755E59F178">it would add con&s;iderably to my happi|ne&s;s, to be favoured with the friend&s;hip and &s;ociety of one whom you have traced through every circum&s;tance of her life, and in whom you have di&s;covered &s;uch amiable qualities. Her actions have alrea|dy excited liberal opinions, and endeared her to all; and need not the feeble pane|gyric of my pen to enhance her merit. In addition to my father's compliments, be &s;o obliging as to pre&s;ent my love, and tell her we &s;hall be at her hou&s;e in about one month. It is our united reque&s;t, that there may be no kind of ceremony in our reception, as we prefer friendly interviews to the modern inconveniences which at|tend vi&s;iting.</P>
<P>I cannot pa&s;s over the tale of Caroline and Sabina in &s;ilence; and yet it were almo&s;t &s;uperfluous to &s;ay more than that it has entirely engaged all my &s;peculative faculties. I have, indeed, bedewed your lines with my tears; and I think the wi&s;e conclu&s;ion of that ancient philo&s;opher Plato, has been thoroughly verified in my feelings&mdash;<HI>that one extreme &s;ucceeds another.</HI> I felt di&s;gu&s;t at the character of Sabina,
<PB N="123" REF="030397_0121_0FE6C678DE6547D0">but it &s;ub&s;ided in pity. All the plea&s;ing enthu&s;ia&s;m of joy and friend&s;hip employed my mind, whil&s;t I contemplated the ami|able Caroline;&mdash;but, alas! the&s;e were &s;oon &s;wallowed up in the mo&s;t exce&s;&s;ive grief. I have rai&s;ed a monument in my heart to her memory&mdash;I have venerated a mind that was every way lovely&mdash;I have &s;ighed at her di&s;&s;olution&mdash;I have rejoiced at her happy exchange.</P>
<P>But will not tho&s;e who have been ble&s;t with her &s;ociety, and admired the beauties of her mind, erect a marble pile to per|petuate her virtues as an example to &s;uc|ceeding ages? Yes, &s;urely they will; and I would gladly contribute to &s;o noble a purpo&s;e. Ah! as I pa&s;&s;ed by the honour|ed &s;pot wherein were depo&s;ited the &s;acred remains of this valuable woman, &s;ympathy would &s;teal the &s;ilent drop from my eyes; my &s;oul would be &s;u&s;pended in thought &mdash;I would &s;eat my&s;elf near her tomb, and methinks I &s;hould contemplate thus:</P>

<L>There re&s;t in peace, thou lovely maid!</L>
<L>There &s;leep in &s;weet repo&s;e;</L>
<L>And though thou moulder with the du&s;t,</L>

<P>You will naturally imagine that I vi&s;|ited all the public places in Bath, before I left it. Yes, Matilda, I did &s;o; but more from curio&s;ity than inclination. I

The ball and concert rooms are elegant indeed; and when they are ornamented by &s;uch crouds of beauties &s;o richly attired, as are &s;ometimes to be &s;een, one cannot help being charmed at the &s;ight. The play-hou&s;e is neat. In &s;hort, the city is compo&s;ed of magnificent buildings, &s;quares, and cre&s;cents. Your la&s;t letter over&s;hadowed my mind with &s;uch gloom, that it deprived me of every reli&s;h for tho&s;e &s;ocial enjoyments. When I &s;ee young folks regardle&s;s of every thing but gaiety and di&s;&s;ipation, I feel a kind of pity for them. I do not wi&s;h to deprive them of rational plea&s;ures&mdash;no; I believe them innocent; but I want them to dive&s;t them|&s;elves of pride&mdash;to con&s;ider they are but creatures&mdash;creatures of a day&mdash;and &s;ome|times of a moment&mdash;that in the mid&s;t of delu&s;ive joys they are expo&s;ed to death.</P>
<P>The human mind wants relaxation; but having once ta&s;ted fancied delights, it can &s;eldom be &s;atisfied, and exce&s;s be|comes dangerous. I think parents &s;hould lay a little more re&s;traint on their children,
<PB N="126" REF="030397_0124_0FE6C681C660F710">than to &s;uffer them to frequent balls. There are perhaps no amu&s;ements more calculated to do mi&s;chief than tho&s;e of dancing. The young females are &s;ur|rounded with beaux who delight in di&s;|&s;ipation, and who &s;carce ever feel a virtu|ous or a generous &s;entiment; but exult in de&s;troying the peace of tho&s;e who fall victims to their villany. In the exerci&s;e I allude to, the body is warmed, the heart is elated, and the imaginations are heat|ed; the con&s;equence of which is, the &s;tripling hero takes advantages of tho&s;e delirious moments&mdash;he ogles and he &s;ighs, and the &s;illy girl hearkens implicitly to his tale. If &s;he e&s;capes the wor&s;er evil, &s;he afterwards feels her&s;elf unable to re&s;i&s;t the powerful impul&s;e of love&mdash;&s;he flies from civil intercour&s;e&mdash;&s;he lingers and dies. A young married gentleman with whom my father is intimate, related the following anecdote:</P>
<P>"When I once," &s;aid he, "returned to London in one of the &s;tage coaches, the company con&s;i&s;ted of two young ladies, a gentleman, and my&s;elf. The gentleman was one of tho&s;e vulgar beings which &s;eem
<PB N="127" REF="030397_0125_0FE6C6831F8B68B0">to be formed to make a variety on the theatre of the world: he uttered but few &s;peeches, and tho&s;e of a cour&s;er &s;ort, dur|ing the journey, but &s;at heedle&s;s of him&s;elf or his company. One of the ladies was young; &s;he was not hand&s;ome, but had &s;omething attracting in her countenance: the other (who was of &s;uperior age, and &s;eemed to be a friendly companion) call|ed her Maria.</P>
<P>"Maria entered the coach with reluc|tance: &s;he wept bitterly; nor could the kind entreaties of the other lady prevail on her to be compo&s;ed. I &s;at oppo&s;ite to her; and before we had left the city &s;he became &s;en&s;ele&s;s. I leaned forward and &s;upported her. In this &s;ituation &s;he con|tinued for &s;ome miles. When &s;he awoke, &s;he a&s;ked pardon for the trouble &s;he had given me. I endeavoured to cheer her &s;pirits by conver&s;ation, but &s;he was too much dejected.</P>
<P>"As we pa&s;&s;ed by &s;ome decayed hou&s;es, &s;he looked out at the window, and &s;ighed. 'Ah!' &s;aid Maria, 'could I but inhabit one of tho&s;e lonely cottages, how happy &s;hould I be! I would gladly exchange &s;ituations.
<PB N="128" REF="030397_0126_0FE6C6832E4542B8">The rays of contentment &s;pread their genial &s;weets&mdash;there their days of poverty are not embittered with pride. Ambition is bounded by manual employments!&mdash;I am unhappy!'&mdash;To which I replied:</P>
<P>'If you knew, Madam, the hard&s;hips which poverty expo&s;es them to, you would be led to different conclu&s;ions. The poor think, if they were rich, &s;orrow and pain would for&s;ake them; but they, perhaps, are equally mi&s;taken with your&s;elf. Every rank in &s;ociety is properly filled: tho&s;e who are now poor, would make but an indifferent figure in a higher &s;phere; and <HI>you</HI> would find it a difficult ta&s;k to &s;upport oppre&s;&s;ion and want.'</P>
<P>"But they are contented," &s;aid &s;he.</P>
<P>'Contentment is equally attainable in every rank. Neither riches nor poverty can con&s;titute the invaluable prize: but the mind that can confine it&s;elf within its own bounds is &s;ure to be in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it. If you &s;ought through the whole &s;y&s;tem of creation, you would find that Provi|dence had di&s;pen&s;ed his ble&s;&s;ings alike. Every one has an inward &s;ource of happi|ne&s;s. The rich &s;hould feel thankful for
<PB N="129" REF="030397_0127_0FE6C68C1DECA118">their mea&s;ure of comforts; the poor be grateful that it is not wor&s;e with them.'</P>
<P>"Maria's heart was too much agitated to continue the conver&s;ation&mdash;&s;he again became convul&s;ed, and continued in al|ternate fits till we reached our journey's end. I inquired of the other lady the cau&s;e of her di&s;order, and found that &s;he had been &s;ome time poorly, and that her parents had permitted her to go to Bath, in compliance with the phy&s;ician's pre|&s;cription, for the benefit of the waters. When &s;he grew better, &s;he frequented the public places of amu&s;ement, and happen|ed to dance with a hand&s;ome young gentle|man, who&s;e genteel deportment engaged her affections: but finding that her charms had not made the tender impre&s;&s;ion &s;he wi&s;hed on his heart, &s;he &s;uddenly gave way to melancholy. Her father and mo|ther hearing that the waters had re&s;tored her (though ignorant of the other circum|&s;tance) reque&s;ted her to return. In obe|dience to their injunctions &s;he complied; but the idea of leaving the object of her love behind had this &s;trange effect on her mind, and I fear will produce a fatal conclu&s;ion."</P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="030397_0128_0FE6C68C2BE0F8A0">
I will not in&s;i&s;t more on the impro|priety of expo&s;ing the credulous girl to temptation; this in&s;tance will perhaps more readily convince, than all the pow|ers of rhetoric.</P>
<P>We left Bath in the morning, and ar|rived at Wells early enough for dinner. My father's curio&s;ity leads him to in&s;pect every venerable pile he pa&s;&s;es by. For my own part, I am at pre&s;ent engaged too much in &s;entiment to attend to the&s;e things.</P>
<P>My father vi&s;ited the Cathedral; after which we pur&s;ued our journey till it be|came late, and then repo&s;ed at an inn on the road. In the morning we &s;et forward again, and reached the town of Dor&s;et to dinner.</P>
<P>At the entrance of this town is a beau|tiful and &s;pacious lawn, where are a va&s;t number of &s;heep continually feeding. I think it an excellent &s;pot for the pencil of an arti&s;t; and if I had time, I &s;hould certainly employ my own pencil.</P>
<P>In the afternoon, after two hours' ride, we approached Weymouth. We have a view of the rolling waves &s;ome miles be|fore
<PB N="131" REF="030397_0129_0FE6C68D42468CD0">we enter the town. The place is &s;o much expo&s;ed to the wind, that it is in|ten&s;ely cold; and I hope our &s;tay will be &s;hort. I &s;hall be more ready to communi|cate at a per&s;onal interview. Believe me, Matilda, I want to &s;ee you after &s;o long an ab&s;ence. Our affections, I believe, &s;till &s;ub|&s;i&s;t uncontaminated under all the changes of life. I &s;hall not have an opportunity of writing to you again before we meet; therefore this letter will clo&s;e my corre&s;|pondence till we &s;hall experience another &s;eparation. Your engagements are not urgent; I mu&s;t beg you to &s;end me a few more lines, and entreat you will not deny my reque&s;t. Adieu.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XVI. TO MISS LOUISA HARTLEY.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>HANTS.</HI></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>A MONUMENT to the mem|ory of Caroline is &s;hortly to be erect|ed, at the &s;ole expen&s;e of her faithful Milward. He thinks it the lea&s;t tribute he can pay her. It is to be of entire mar|ble, and the workmen are bu&s;ily employed about it. A cro&s;s is to be &s;upported by a pillar on each &s;ide, which are to a&s;cend from beautiful pede&s;tals. There are to be &s;everal emblematical figures, which will render it &s;uperbly rich.</P>
<P>I have &s;hewn your lines to Mr. Mil|ward; he is &s;o highly plea&s;ed with them, that he &s;ays they &s;hall follow the epitaph, which runs thus:
<PB N="133" REF="030397_0131_0FE6C69408651BE0">
<Q>Stop, Stranger&mdash;pau&s;e awhile, And read The following Lines: Not Far from hence, Secure from human view, In Yonder &s;ilent Vault, Where cares or troubles never enter; Where &s;oft repo&s;e is ne'er di&s;turb'd, Nor human ills inrade; In yonder dark Retreat, In yonder &s;olitary Cave, Lies unmole&s;ted CAROLINE. Her frame lies mouldering there; But ah! her happy &s;pirit's gone to ble&s;&s;edne&s;s. Peace &s;its &s;miling on her Heavenly brow, And Love cele&s;tial brightens every feature. The village mourn'd her death; It felt the lo&s;s Of Virtue and Benevolence like hers. Her haple&s;s Swain Bore all the agonies of grief; The rais'd this Marble Monument, To tell the gazing throng That Virtue never dies, And Bid the world be virtuous. LINES BY A LADY. There re&s;t in peace, thou lovely maid! &amp;c.</Q></P>

Thus, Loui&s;a, your wi&s;hes will be lit|erally fulfilled. You will pardon me for giving up your lines; I am per&s;uaded your vanity will not be too much flat|tered. It was the reque&s;t of the di&s;con|&s;olate Milward,</P>
<P>I have another &s;ecret to unfold. Mrs. An&s;ell has &s;een the whole of our letters &s;ince our la&s;t &s;eparation. She is ince&s;&s;ant|ly teazing me to give her copies of them, and wi&s;hes me to &s;ubmit them to public view. She thinks the young will be amu&s;|ed, without the danger of having their morals corrupted. I have at length yield|ed to her entreaties, before I have obtain|ed your con&s;ent. I know you cannot ob|ject to it, particularly as Mrs. An&s;ell has promi&s;ed to conceal our real &s;ignatures, and adopt others; and the peru&s;al of gen|uine letters of friend&s;hip, may perhaps be of &s;ervice to many young people.</P>
<P>Before I clo&s;e this corre&s;pondence, give me leave to &s;ay, I have ca&s;t my eyes round my own little circle, and ob&s;erva|tion leads me to conclude that life has its difficulties as well as its plea&s;ures. We ought to be prepared to meet vici&s;&s;itudes
<PB N="135" REF="030397_0133_0FE6C6965596DEE8">with compo&s;ure; and if we e&s;cape the woes of the unfortunate, let us not be in|different to their &s;ighs. The brighte&s;t genius, or the mo&s;t exalted character, will never be di&s;graced by &s;en&s;ibility. We are all fond of pity in misfortune, and &s;hall we deny the troubled &s;oul that &s;ym|pathetic tenderne&s;s we &s;hould con&s;ider an hard&s;hip to be deprived of our&s;elves?</P>
<P>I anticipate our happy meeting; but I fear to be too anxious, le&s;t our plea&s;ures &s;hould be marred by &s;ome unplea&s;ing oc|currence. I need not beg Loui&s;a to con|tinue he affectionate regard for</P>
