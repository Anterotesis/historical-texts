<HEAD>PREFACE TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P><HI>I WAS</HI> a &s;pectator of the &s;cene of di&s;tre&s;s, which I am about to narrate. I was at Mr. Jo&s;eph Metcalf's in Lebanon, and I think no place has &s;uffered more than <HI>his,</HI> and the farms which lie in the direction in which the &s;torm went, as it pa&s;&s;ed from the &s;outhward to the northward.

<P>I have &s;ince endeavoured to obtain as accurate information as po&s;&s;ible, which I mean to lay before the public, in as impar|tial a manner as po&s;&s;ible. I am not one of the &s;ufferers, there|fore I cannot be under any inducement to exaggerate it, from motives of intere&s;t.

<HEAD>ACCOUNT OF A HAIL STORM.</HEAD>
<P>AS I am about to give an account of a hail &s;torm, which happened on the 15th of July, perhaps never equalled &s;ince that in Egypt, according to the Mo&s;aic ac|count, 3290 years &s;ince, I hope my readers will pardon my making a few ob&s;ervations, that will naturally occur to my mind, in giving an account of &s;uch an extraordina|ry phenomenon.</P>
<P>I have wi&s;hed for &s;ome time that a more able pen might be employed on the &s;ubject than mine; but as no one has undertaken it, in any other way than for a public new&s;paper, which will &s;oon be lo&s;t and worn out, &s;o that future generations will have no de&s;cription of it, and tho&s;e who are now children will have nothing to help their memory, and when they come to manhood, will have only a confu&s;ed and bewildered idea of it, by the pre&s;&s;ing de&s;ire of a number of friends, I have undertaken a de&s;cription of it.</P>
<P>Monday, the 15th of July, 1799, the day on which this ever memorable hail &s;torm happened, was very warm; by Farenheit's thermometer, I &s;hould judge it to have been from 90 to 92; but as I had not the benefit of one, I cannot a&s;certain what the degree of heat was.</P>
<P>About one o'clock a cloud pa&s;&s;ed over from the we&s;t. This cloud I ob&s;erved role very high; the drops of rain which fell were uncommonly large, but it was nothing more than a light &s;hower. After this cloud pa&s;&s;ed, it &s;eemed to collect a great quantity of electricity, which produced a continued roar, for &s;ome time, that did not ap|pear to be wholly the effect of lightning. I ob&s;erved to a friend that I thought it was hail, for the cloud appeared like it. I have &s;ince been informed that hail fell from it at Pre&s;ton, &s;everal miles ea&s;t of this, as large as a robin's egg, but in &s;mall numbers. This cloud kept its cour&s;e to the ea&s;tward, till it met the more den&s;e air of the &s;ea, when it appeared to lie without motion. About two
<PB N="6" REF="035405_0004_1004BA0208E6EA58">o'clock, another cloud ro&s;e from the we&s;t, and &s;ettled to the S. E. till it met the &s;ea breeze, which threw it back o|ver the land.</P>
<P>There was no threatening appearance in this cloud; it was attended with &s;ome lightning and thunder, which were at a di&s;tance. About five o'clock a third cloud ap|peared in the W. N. W. attended with lightning and thunder, and looked darker than the former ones. Be|tween &s;ix and &s;even o'clock, that in the &s;outh looked un|commonly black, and moved with great &s;wiftne&s;s, taking its cour&s;e to the northward, preceded by flying clouds of a lead colour, &s;uch as are not uncommon to be &s;een in a heavy thunder &s;torm. The two clouds in the ea&s;t and we&s;t then &s;eemed to move as if to form a junction, whil&s;t that in the &s;outh &s;till kept its cour&s;e with great rapidity, and &s;oon over&s;hadowed us, rolling in various forms, like pillars of &s;moke, and almo&s;t entirely ob&s;cured the light of the &s;un. The heavens &s;eemed clad in &s;ackcloth, and &s;hrouded with darkne&s;s, whil&s;t lightning and thunder wit|ne&s;&s;ed the war of the elements. The appearance was truly frightful; but the &s;cene which &s;oon followed &s;ur|pa&s;&s;ed the &s;cenery. Where &s;hall I find language to paint this in its true colours?</P>
<P>As the painter falls &s;hort of giving a likene&s;s for want of colours, &s;o &s;hall I fail for want of words; for words can only convey &s;uch ideas as have been in our minds; and I conceive that none of my readers, who were not pre&s;ent, ever beheld &s;uch a &s;ublime, grand and awful &s;cene as this pre&s;ented. A few minutes before &s;even the cloud exhib|ited a bra&s;&s;y appearance in the we&s;t. This was immedi|ately followed by the rain, which poured down as if fed by a water &s;pout, and la&s;ted three or four minutes, when hail began to fall, larger than any which I had ever &s;een. They were as large as a turkey's egg, in va&s;t numbers, and many were larger. Terrour now pervaded even the brute creation; every creature &s;ought for &s;helter; but our hou&s;es were &s;carce able to afford us an a&s;ylum from this dreadful &s;torm. The hail, urged on by the rapidity of the wind, &s;oon demoli&s;hed the gla&s;s, and the roar of this tem|pe&s;tuous &s;torm &s;ilenced the loude&s;t thunder, &s;o that it could not be heard. The rain &s;till continued. The lightning was ince&s;&s;ant and &s;eemed to hail mingled with fire. All countenances turned pale, and every heart gathered &s;adne&s;s. The terrific &s;ound of this war of ele|ments;
<PB N="7" REF="035405_0005_1004BA055AF90B68">the air filled with &s;olid &s;ub&s;tances, which cut the leaves, fruit and &s;mall limbs of the trees, whil&s;t continued fla&s;hes of lightning tinged every thing of a livid appear|ance, added horrour to the gloom, and filled every one with a&s;toni&s;hment. It &s;eemed as if the laws of nature were changed, or that the elements had waged war with each other. For the &s;pace of ten or twelve minutes, it pre&s;ented a &s;cene which I cannot de&s;cribe. It appeared, as if the final di&s;&s;olution of all things had now commenc|ed. I expected every thing would be laid pro&s;trate be|fore it. The earth trembled, as if &s;hocked by an earth|quake. Children were crying to their parents for help, whil&s;t they &s;tood the a&s;toni&s;hed &s;pectators of this inde|&s;cribable &s;cene. Every heart &s;eemed to melt like wax before the fire. In &s;hort, nothing could &s;urpa&s;s the &s;en&s;a|tions of a feeling mind on this occa&s;ion. After ten or twelve minutes it abated for a &s;hort &s;pace, when the rain again fell like a torrent, and la&s;ted &s;ome time, attended with &s;harp lightning and heavy thunder. After this a &s;olemn &s;tillne&s;s prevailed during the whole night, which, when compared with the confu&s;ed noi&s;e that had been &s;ounding in our ears, it &s;eemed as if we were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with different &s;en&s;ations, or that all nature was hu&s;hed in &s;i|lence. There was the mo&s;t perfect calm I ever &s;aw. The day following was calm and plea&s;ant; but nothing appeared beautiful; no tuneful bird was left to welcome in the cheerle&s;s day. The inhabitants of the airy regions fell the fir&s;t victims to the relentle&s;s hand of di&s;ordered elements, and were found in the fields and woods, &s;ome dead, others with their wings broken, and not one was to be &s;een or heard unhurt. The &s;mall animals of all kinds, who had no &s;helter, &s;hared the &s;ame fate: among which were fowls, pigs, &amp;c. In many in&s;tances, &s;heep were killed. I &s;aw one that was killed; it appeared as if &s;truck on the top of the head by a hail &s;tone, which beat off the &s;kin two inches in length, and one in breadth.</P>
<P>When the &s;torm fir&s;t began, the cattle &s;hewed the greate&s;t &s;igns of terrour they could expre&s;s. They ran and roared like bullocks, who were going to the &s;laughter, and &s;ought for &s;helter. Some broke out of the fields, and ran to the fir&s;t covert that could be found: tho&s;e who had no &s;helter were cut and brui&s;ed very much.</P>
<P>No per&s;on was killed, for there was no one out but a few minutes. A Mr. John&s;on was a few rods from his
<PB N="8" REF="035405_0006_1004BA07D49A23B0">hou&s;e, and before he could reach it he was knocked down three times; a number of others were knocked down and brui&s;ed very much.</P>
<P>The fields of gra&s;s and grain were not only beaten down, but cut to pieces, and only fit for the hogs and cattle. A gentleman informed me that he reapt or mowed up ten &s;hocks of the be&s;t rye he had, which, on thre&s;hing, produced only three quarts to a &s;hock. Fields of gra&s;s, which were mown but a few hours before the &s;torm com|menced to walk over them, the day following it was difficult to tell which had been mown and which had not. The feeding lands were cut to pieces &s;o that the feed was &s;poiled for &s;ome weeks. In corn fields, which were as good as any I had &s;een this year, and which I was ob&s;erv|ing the &s;ame afternoon, on the day following not a &s;pire was left &s;tanding, and almo&s;t every one cut off with|in four inches of the ground. In fields in general, &s;carce a &s;pire was left, and the indu&s;trious hu&s;bandman imme|diately ploughed his fields, and &s;owed them with buck wheat; this being the only re&s;ource left by which he could obtain &s;omething to &s;upply the calls of nature for him&s;elf and family. Barley, flax, beans, peas, potatoes, gardens, &amp;c. are entirely de&s;troyed.</P>
<P>The trees are cut and brui&s;ed very much. Young fruit trees are almo&s;t, if not entirely de&s;troyed. Peach and Cherry trees &s;uffered mo&s;t; many of them are dead al|ready; others I think will die, a great part of the bark being brui&s;ed or beaten off on that &s;ide toward the &s;outh. Some orchards are almo&s;t &s;tripped of leaves, as well as fruit. Many fruit and fore&s;t trees are blown down. Trees, buildings, and fences are &s;o marked they will re|main, many years, the &s;tanding monuments of the vio|lence of the &s;torm. The bark on large trees begins to grow out, as if &s;carified by the head of an ax. A week or ten days after, the wood lands exhibibited the appear|ance of woods through which large fires have pa&s;&s;ed. The &s;hingles on the hou&s;es are &s;plit to pieces very much. All the gla&s;s on that &s;ide next the &s;torm was broken; and, in many in&s;tances, the &s;a&s;h was not proof again&s;t its vio|lence. Two barns in Bozrah were entirely demoli&s;hed, and one unroofed.</P>
<P>The &s;torm began in the we&s;ternmo&s;t part of Bozrah, in the County of Newlondon, in Connecticut, and took its cour&s;e from S. W. to N. E. was about nine miles in
<PB N="9" REF="035405_0007_1004BA0961CBB3F0">length, and four in width. In its cour&s;e it took the great|e&s;t part of the towns of Bozrah, Franklin, and &s;ome part of Lebanon. The ea&s;t part of the pari&s;h of Go&s;hen, in Lebanon, and the ea&s;t edge of the old town, &s;uffered as &s;everely as any part of the three towns.</P>
<P>I &s;aid this &s;torm began in Bozrah; but I would remark that a few &s;mall hail &s;tones fell from this cloud at Lyme and Ea&s;thaddam, as it pa&s;&s;ed to the northward. It &s;tripped the leaves of corn a little, but the damage was trifling.</P>
<P>When it began in Bozrah, it was very &s;evere, and the hail was nearly as large as in any place where the &s;torm went. When this cloud moved to the north, it moved very quick, till it came nearly over the place where the hail began to fall fir&s;t, when it rolled into the atmo&s;phere, like the &s;moke of buildings on fire.</P>
<P>I &s;tood and viewed the cloud till it over&s;hadowed and almo&s;t deprived us of light. The lightning was almo&s;t one continued blaze, but &s;o high that it did not &s;eem to af|fect the earth; and the thunder roared as if at a di&s;tance, and was nearly one continued peal, till the hail began to fall, when it had to &s;ubmit to &s;uperior &s;ound, as mu&s;ketry are &s;ilenced when a cannonade begins.</P>
<P>Whil&s;t the&s;e movements were taking place, there was but little air, till the hail began to fall, when it blowed with great violence. It blew in the &s;ame direction, that is, from S. W. to N. E. except in one or two in&s;tances, where it whirled &s;o as to break the gla&s;s on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the hou&s;e from that on which the &s;torm had been beating.</P>
<P>But a few &s;econds had elap&s;ed, after the fir&s;t hail &s;tones fell, before they fell as fa&s;t as at any time during the &s;torm. It run in what is called veins. In the we&s;tern part of the extent of the &s;torm the hail were the large&s;t, and fell &s;o as to cover the ground, if they had been &s;trewed equal|ly on it. After this cloud had pa&s;&s;ed four or five miles, the hail gradually decrea&s;ed in numbers and bigne&s;s, till the &s;torm cea&s;ed. In &s;ome places they fell four inches deep. It differed very much in depth, even in places that day in the direction in which it went. In &s;ome places, by travelling forty rods, you might go from where vegeta|tion was in its highe&s;t perfection to where nothing but de&s;olation &s;trewed the face of nature. The two heavie&s;t veins were on the we&s;t and ea&s;t &s;ide of this tract of de&s;|olation.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="035405_0008_1004BA0B87F1DFE0">
The great quantity of rain, which fell during the &s;torm, and a few minutes after, wa&s;hed it into heaps, &s;o that, where it lodged again&s;t walls and fences, it was three or four feet deep, which lay &s;ome time. In the meadow of Benjamin Throop, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> hail &s;tones were taken up on the ninth day after, as large as a mu&s;ket ball. The weather was very hot, during this time. I would not be under|&s;tood that they were wholly uncovered, for they were covered with gra&s;s, which was cut up and wa&s;hed together with them. In &s;ome places the rain fell before the hail, in others the hail fell fir&s;t.</P>
<P>The &s;tate of the air was changed in a few minutes, from being very hot, to the degree of cold that it felt like a hail &s;torm in winter; by means of which many took cold, and injured their health very much. In general, they u&s;ed every precaution, which was in their power; &s;uch as addition of clothing, u&s;e of &s;pirits, building of fires, &amp;c. Notwith&s;tanding all the&s;e precautions, many were &s;eized with cramps and ague fits.</P>
<P>Per&s;ons who vi&s;ited the place twenty four hours after, &s;aid that, in travelling half a mile, it &s;eemed as if they had got into another climate. People who went from the place &s;aid the &s;ame.</P>
<P>When this &s;torm abated, or more properly had pa&s;&s;ed over, the noi&s;e gradually cea&s;ed, like the noi&s;e of an earth|quake. I have ob&s;erved that the earth trembled; whether it was occa&s;ioned by the wind and hail beating on it, or from there being an uncommon quantity of electricity received into it from the cloud, is not for me to &s;ay.&mdash;The jar of it was like that which we feel in a violent thun|der &s;torm.</P>
<P>The hail &s;tones, as I have ob&s;erved, were as large as a turkey's egg, and many were larger. I mea&s;ured &s;ome, which were four inches and a quarter by five and a half in circumference, and were uncommonly hard; the appear|ance of them was like a number of &s;mall ones congealed together, and very rough. Some were of a conical figure; others were &s;haped &s;omewhat like a che&s;nut bur, when open, being notched on the out &s;ide, and appeared as if you had taken a number of &s;mall ones and put them into a large one about half their diameter, which left a &s;mall hollow, or cavity, about the bigne&s;s of the end of a finger on one or both &s;ides. Some were round and &s;mooth as gla&s;s, looked white and clear, like ice that is congealed
<PB N="11" REF="035405_0009_1004BA108019F488">from pure water, in extreme cold weather. The other kind were of the colour of common ice, and of a dirty ca&s;t, e&s;pecially tho&s;e that were large&s;t, and fell fir&s;t.&mdash;Many of the&s;e lumps of ice were &s;haped like a &s;now ball, that is pre&s;&s;ed with a hand, inclining to be round, but not &s;mooth. There were none, which I &s;aw, &s;maller than a mu&s;ketball; and there were more of them that exceeded the bigne&s;s of a &s;mall hen's egg, than there were of that &s;ize, except tho&s;e which were round, and they were not in large numbers. The greate&s;t part of the ice fell in pieces larger than a &s;mall hen's egg, that is, the balance of weight was on that &s;ide.</P>
<P>This is as it appeared where I was, but they were not &s;o large in any other vein, as that which was on the we&s;t edge.</P>
<P>On viewing &s;ome of the large&s;t hail &s;tones, I ob&s;erved black &s;pecks and &s;treaks in them, which, on examining. I found to be &s;pecks of dirt, and leaves of dry gra&s;s, of an eighth of an inch in length, in the middle of the &s;olid ice. This is an ob&s;ervation which perhaps no one has made be&s;ide me. There were a number of per&s;ons pre&s;|ent, and no one ob&s;erved it, till I &s;pake of it to them.&mdash;The mentioning of this circum&s;tance obliges me to make &s;ome ob&s;ervations, to make it plain and obvious to my readers; and, as I am not a philo&s;opher, I hope they will pardon me, if I do not &s;atisfy their minds on this head.&mdash;This &s;torm began with con&s;iderable wind, &s;ome miles to the &s;outhward of the place where the hail fir&s;t fell, that in &s;ome places was attended with a whirl, which would con&s;equently throw tho&s;e light particles of matter into the air to a great height. I would not be under&s;tood that it was a proper whirlwind; it only whirled in &s;ome places, as it does many times in the beginning of a thunder &s;torm, this was what carried them into the clouds. The next thing is to &s;hew what occa&s;ioned the hail to form as it did. When that cloud in the &s;outh moved toward the north, tho&s;e two in the ea&s;t and we&s;t, whether impelled by the more den&s;e air of the &s;ea from the ea&s;t, and the cool breezes from the great lakes in the we&s;t, or from the pow|er of attraction in them&s;elves, I &s;ay from which of the&s;e, or from both operating together, is not for me to determ|ine, the&s;e clouds moved toward each other. They then lay, as I judged, in a direction from that in the &s;outh, about N. E. and N. W. at &s;uch a di&s;tance as nearly to
<PB N="12" REF="035405_0010_1004BA120BD3B1D8">form a right angle, and all &s;eemed to ru&s;h to the centre. That in the ea&s;t moved on, while that in the we&s;t moved with much more force, and at the &s;ame time that in the &s;outh approached us with great rapidity, as if it would bear down all before it, when it met tho&s;e two from the ea&s;t and we&s;t. The&s;e three currents of air meeting each oth|er, it was impo&s;&s;ible for them to have vent any other way than by rolling into the empty &s;pace which was above them.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e three &s;treams of water, of great force, &s;hould meet each other, they would naturally boil into the air to a con&s;iderable height, and that &s;tream which was of the greate&s;t force would &s;till keep its cour&s;e, pre&s;&s;ing the oth|er two into that &s;pace which was void. This I have done to illu&s;trate the idea. The two currents of air from the N. E. and N. W. meeting with that from the &s;outh, which was much &s;tronger than either of the other two, or both of them united, and each being &s;upported by a fre&s;h breeze of wind, it rolled them into the atmo&s;phere, almo&s;t, if not quite, above the circumambient, or &s;urrounding air, when the inten&s;e cold congealed the water, which was in the cloud; and that, when congealed, fell, having a great degree of fro&s;t in them&s;elves, and falling through the great body of water, which lay below, they &s;truck each other and congealed into a &s;olid ma&s;s before they fell to the earth, which occa&s;ioned them to be of &s;uch an uncommon bigne&s;s.</P>
<P>To &s;upport this idea, I &s;hall make &s;ome ob&s;ervations, which I think are in favour of it. The day being uncom|monly warm, the air was expanded very much, which occa&s;ioned the clouds to ri&s;e higher than u&s;ual, and, be|ing forced together, would naturally ri&s;e to a va&s;t height.</P>
<P>Air is of &s;uch a nature that&punc; it may be pre&s;&s;ed to a cer|tain degree, and when it comes to have vent, being of a more ela&s;tic quality than water, it ri&s;es much ea&s;ier, and, con&s;equently, much higher, with the &s;ame force. As water, being put in motion at the bottom, ri&s;es to the &s;ur|face, and boils into the air; &s;o the air, being pent up or pre&s;&s;ed together in &s;ome degree, and then getting vent upward, being crowded on by the &s;ame winds, it mu&s;t ri&s;e far above the &s;urface of the common air, when in a &s;tate of equilibrium, or equal balance. As water ri&s;es above the &s;urface of water in proportion with the force that puts it in motion, at the bottom; &s;o the&s;e clouds mu&s;t ri&s;e above the &s;urface of the common air, in proportion
<PB N="13" REF="035405_0011_1004BA13A67AE420">with the force with which they were &s;upported.&mdash;The&s;e clouds being thrown to a great height, and being deprived of heat, it gave the cold (which is only a le&s;s degree of heat) a greater chance to operate on them.</P>
<P>To &s;trengthen this idea, I would ob&s;erve that the hail &s;tones were larger in the we&s;tern extent of the &s;torm than in the ea&s;tern part of it; that cloud from the we&s;t being &s;upported by a much &s;tronger wind, which would throw it higher into the cold regions, above the reflection of heat.</P>
<P>I &s;hall now make a few ob&s;ervations, for which I am indebted to particular gentlemen, on who&s;e veracity I may rely. Some miles we&s;t of the &s;torm, a number of gentlemen informed me that the wind blew very hard from the we&s;t, when the cloud pa&s;&s;ed from the we&s;tward toward that in the &s;outh.</P>
<P>In Norwich, a few miles ea&s;t, a number of gentlemen informed me, that when the cloud in the ea&s;t moved tow|ard the S. W. that in the &s;outh moved very &s;wift to meet it, and that in the we&s;t coming up, they &s;eemed to roll in|to the air, for &s;ome time, when the other clouds gave way, or rather united, with that in the &s;outh, and rolled on to the northward. The wind blew fre&s;h from the N. E. at that place, all the while the&s;e clouds were forming, and continued &s;o till that from the &s;outh appeared to over|power the other two, when they moved on, attended with &s;harp lightning and heavy thunder.</P>
<P>In Go&s;hen, three or four miles we&s;t, it appeared to roll in a wild, confu&s;ed, di&s;ordered form, exhibiting an ap|pearance that was very &s;ingular; the cloud looked of a per|fect black, and &s;treams of lightning ran in every direction. Spectators viewed it with a degree of anxiety, for tho&s;e who were doomed to feel its violence. The roar was one continued &s;ound, all the time the&s;e clouds were pa&s;&s;|ing. Sometimes the peals of thunder could be di&s;tin|gui&s;hed, at others they could not. I was at Ea&s;thaddam, five days after the &s;torm, a number of per&s;ons informed me that the wind blew heavy from the &s;outh while this was pa&s;&s;ing and continued &s;ome time after it pa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>Major Throop, of Bozrah, a man of ob&s;ervation, &s;ays he &s;tood and viewed it from a north window, and that at one time it fell &s;o fa&s;t it appeared like a bank of hail in the air, and an object could not be di&s;tingui&s;hed at the di&s;|tance of three rods. The hail looked whiter in the la&s;t of
<PB N="14" REF="035405_0012_1004BA158AACFC88">the &s;torm than in the fore part of it. The rain immedi|ately followed, which fell like a &s;olid body of water and wa&s;hed them into heaps.</P>
<P>If the ob&s;ervations which I have made are ju&s;t, I think it will be ea&s;y to account for the particles of matter being in the middle of the&s;e pieces of ice. On cutting them o|pen it was evident, they were a number of &s;mall ones con|gealed together, and the particles of matter appeared to lie between tho&s;e fir&s;t congealed pebbles of ice.</P>
<P>The following is what cannot be a&s;certained, therefore I &s;hall only lay it down as a conjectural idea, which is this, that tho&s;e hail &s;tones were kept in the air for &s;ome time, by whirling. This, perhaps, you will &s;ay is a chi|mera of my own brain, and true, the whole theory which I have advanced is mine, and from my own ob&s;ervation; but, in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, it is not &s;o ea&s;ily demon&s;trated from facts, as the former ones have been; notwith&s;tand|ing this I will make a few remarks on the &s;ubject. When currents of water are forced again&s;t each other they pro|duce whirlpools, eddies &amp;c. When currents of air are for|ced again&s;t each other they produce whirlwinds. The objector will &s;ay, who ever heard of a whirlwind in the air, when there was none on the earth? In an&s;wer to this, I would a&s;k, if they ever &s;aw a whirlpool on the &s;ur|face of the water, when objects lay unmoved and unaf|fected at the bottom? He will then &s;ay, that that conden|&s;ity of air, which forms a rapid whirlwind, would certain|ly &s;ettle to the earth, if it began in the air? In an&s;wer to it, I will &s;tate one propo&s;ition, which is this, &s;uppo&s;e a large tube to be placed &s;o as to have three &s;treams of wa|ter forced into it, would they not boil into the air and run over the top? Place this tube &s;everal feet under water, and would it not produce whirlpools and commo|tions in the water, which was above it, but I think it would not affect the water any great depth below the top of the tube? That there were three currents of air forced to|gether, has been proved. The compre&s;&s;ion of the &s;ur|rounding atmo&s;phere &s;ufficiently &s;upplied the place of a tube. When the&s;e three breezes of wind met, the clouds, filled with water, were driven into the empty &s;pace a|bove, where the air immediately became expanded, by being where there was no &s;urrounding air, to keep it con|den&s;ed, as it had been, and when this rarification, or thinning of the air, took place, tho&s;e heavy particles of water in&s;tnata|neou&s;ly
<PB N="15" REF="035405_0013_1004BA1A962766E8">fell together; and formed into drops before the &s;pace, in which they then were, became cooled &s;o as to give the cold a chance to operate on them; the&s;e drops were no &s;ooner formed, than they were congealed into &s;ol|id ice, and fell into tho&s;e whirlwinds, which were below, that kept them from falling for &s;ome time, and every per|&s;on mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible that the air, in a whirlwind, is very cold, and being fed by this cloud, filled with particles of water, they &s;till kept increa&s;ing, by &s;triking together and freezing. One thing is certain, the&s;e pieces of ice would &s;tick together, &s;o as to lift each other. I took three or four, and put them together, then took hold of one, it would lift the whole as a magnet lifts a bit of &s;teel; this they would do, when but a &s;mall part touched each other. The rea&s;on of this, is that for which I &s;hall not un|dertake to account, but leave it for the reader to make his own comment on it, as he plea&s;es. I will clo&s;e, with making one more remark on the &s;ubject, in order to prove the Hypothe&s;is, which I have advanced, as far as I am capable of doing it, and which is this, that tho&s;e hail &s;tones, which were round fell la&s;t. In my own ob|&s;ervation, I &s;aw none till the la&s;t of the &s;hower. As &s;oon as the &s;torm cea&s;ed, I went out and viewed the hail be|fore the la&s;t &s;hower fell, which followed in about three minutes. The round ones appeared to lie on the top of the piles of hail, as round &s;now lies on the top of the &s;now, after a &s;now &s;torm. My idea, in this re&s;pect, is this, that tho&s;e hail &s;tones were high in the air, when congealed, and met with nothing but the remaining par|ticles of water, through which the others had pa&s;&s;ed, which mu&s;t be cooled to the freezing point, much near|er the earth, than when it began, and would con&s;equent|ly congeal much ea&s;ier, which increa&s;ed them to the &s;ize that I have mentioned. The rain, which fell after the hail, was very cold. It felt like the colde&s;t water I ever &s;aw. In my enquiry on this head, two per&s;ons inform|ed me that the fir&s;t hail &s;tone they &s;aw was round, but &s;mall; not larger than a mu&s;ket ball; and that after this they &s;aw none but tho&s;e rough ones, till the la&s;t of the &s;torm. This is a &s;till farther confirmation of what I laid down, as a rea&s;on for tho&s;e hail&s;tones being round, which fell la&s;t, for tho&s;e which fell fir&s;t would not have any thing but water to pa&s;s, which was not cooled &s;o much as to freeze &s;o ea&s;ily, therefore they were &s;maller than tho&s;e which fell la&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="035405_0014_1004BA1C22FB71C0">
The foregoing hypothe&s;is, which I have advanced, is the re&s;ult of my own ob&s;ervation. I have compiled it, without any kind of a&s;&s;i&s;tance; and whether the argu|ments, which I have laid down, are founded on rea&s;on or not, I leave it for the candid and impartial reader to judge: and, if they are not conclu&s;ive, I hope he will ra|ther pity than cen&s;ure me for my weakne&s;s.</P>
<P>The above &s;torm has laid wa&s;te one of the mo&s;t beautiful and flouri&s;hing parts of the country: a place where the people lived in ea&s;e and plenty, but not in luxury and idlene&s;s. Their cows afforded milk, their fields afforded bread their trees yielded fruit, all the&s;e they had in abun|dance; but the pre&s;ent year will not afford them the mea|gre pittance that the bogs of Ireland, and the inho&s;pitable regions of Iceland afford the wretched inhabitants of their &s;oil. No, not &s;o much as a few potatoes. A great re|ver&s;e of fortune, indeed, to have their &s;ituation changed, from one of the be&s;t to one of the poore&s;t. When win|ter came they u&s;ed to view their granaries filled with grain, their barns filled with hay, their wives and daugh|ters fulfilling what Solomon &s;ays of the indu&s;trious wife, "She layeth her hand to the &s;pindle, and her hands hold the di&s;taff." The pre&s;ent year, their repo&s;itories of earth|ly good, will be to them as lonely as the tombs of their ance&s;tors. They once &s;tretched out their hands to the poor, but now they are empty, and have only to reflect, like the unhappy wretch, who is wrecked on the barren coa&s;t, that once he was in plenty, and then he did to others what he would wi&s;h them to do for him, &s;till hop|ing that the &s;un&s;hine of pro&s;perity will gild the days of his future life, with that plenty, which he has ever re|ceived from the labours of his hands; and that he &s;hall then enjoy, with a refined happine&s;s, (unknown to any but tho&s;e who&s;e feelings have been &s;trung with the tender cords of mi&s;ery and misfortune) that it is good to be in pro&s;perity, and not in adver&s;ity.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent di&s;tre&s;&s;ing &s;torm &s;erves many noble and wi&s;e purpo&s;es; a few of which I &s;hall mention; not that I mean to &s;ay what were the motives in the innate Coun|cils of JEHOVAH for bringing this upon the land, but only &s;uch as it ought to &s;erve us, as the creatures on whom it is &s;ent. In the fir&s;t place, it &s;erves the noble purpo&s;e of trying the charity of the world, of which, I &s;hall &s;peak more at large in the following &s;heets. It
<PB N="17" REF="035405_0015_1004BA1DD2FCCB48">likewi&s;e &s;erves the purpo&s;e of confirming, in &s;ome re|&s;pects, the truth of &s;acred hi&s;tory. There are many things, &s;poken of in the Bible, at which infidelity laughs, and Chri&s;tians look upon them as figures, and no doubt many of them are &s;uch; yet there are many, which have and will be literally fulfilled. The fir&s;t, of which the &s;a|cred writings make mention, is that in Egypt, which hap|pened 1491 years before the Chri&s;tian aera. We find that it &s;mote every thing that was in the field, both man and bea&s;t, and brake every tree of the field; notwith&s;tand|ing all this, there is good ground to believe it was not more &s;evere than the pre&s;ent one, and, by &s;ome things, it &s;eems it was not quite &s;o &s;evere. We read that the wheat and rye were not &s;mitten, becau&s;e they were not grown up, but barley and flax were, for the flax was bowl|ed, and the barley was in the ear; from this circum&s;tance, many have imagined that it happened at the &s;ame time in the year. For the information of tho&s;e, I &s;hall take the liberty to quote a few pa&s;&s;ages from Charles Thomp|&s;on's ob&s;ervations on the productions of Egypt.</P>
<P>"In Egypt they have two harve&s;ts. What is called the &s;pring harve&s;t is from January to May, and a winter harve&s;t about October. For the latter, about March, be|fore the land is overflowed, they &s;ow rice, Indian wheat, and what they call corn of Dama&s;cus, which produces a large cane, and has an ear like millet. At the &s;ame time, they plant &s;ugar cane, for they all require a great deal of water, e&s;pecially rice, which is reaped before the flood is quite gone, and removed to dry ground. The large&s;t crops of this are produced near Damietta and Ro&s;etta. The rice has an ear &s;omewhat like oats, and the grain looks like barley before the hu&s;k is taken off. Their &s;pring corn, and vegetables, are &s;own in November, or &s;omething &s;ooner or later, according as the waters retire, but earlier where it is not overflowed by the river. The&s;e are wheat, which is all bearded, and barley, which has &s;ix rows of grain in one ear, and is u&s;ed chiefly for hor&s;es: as al&s;o flax, lentiles, lupines, and things of the &s;ame nature. The wheat, which they &s;ow at this time of the year, they reap in March and April." <HI>Charles Thomp&s;on's Travels in the years</HI> 1732 <HI>and</HI> 1733, <HI>through Syria, Egypt, and the Holy Land, volume</HI> II.</P>
<P>In regard to this, that &s;o many lives were lo&s;t in that &s;torm and none in this, &s;ome may &s;ay that it was not &s;o
<PB N="18" REF="035405_0016_1004BA1FB11FE998">&s;evere as it was in Egypt. On this I &s;hall make &s;ome ob&s;ervations. Egypt is a low flat country, overflowed by the river Nile, which ri&s;es to a va&s;t height, occa&s;ioned by the great rains, which fall on the mountains in Aby&s;|&s;inia, and Ethiopia, (for it never rains in Egypt) this oc|ca&s;ions it to ri&s;e, and when it is at its height, the dikes are cut, and nearly the whole face of the country is over|flowed.</P>
<P>This country, &s;ays a traveller, at two &s;ea&s;ons affords one of the mo&s;t beautiful pro&s;pects in nature, viz. at the time the flood is at its height, and when the country is in its verdure, after the flood has &s;ub&s;ided. When the flood is at its height, it appears like one continued &s;ea, inter|&s;per&s;ed with villages, which are built on eminences, rai&s;|ed by art, &s;o that nothing can be &s;een, but &s;mall villages, the tops of orange trees, &amp;c. which affords a mo&s;t beauti|ful and picture&s;que appearance. I find no mention made by travellers, of any trees growing in that part of the country, except orange and fig trees, which any per&s;on mu&s;t know, who is acquainted with them, that they would afford but an indifferent &s;helter from a hail &s;torm, like the pre&s;ent one. The orange tree re&s;embles the common pear tree, more than any other, only it grows more &s;len|der and not &s;o high. The fig tree grows &s;omewhat like a &s;umach in the bigne&s;s of its body and limbs. Such trees would afford but an indifferent &s;helter, for man or bea&s;t. The Egyptians, living, as I ob&s;erved, in &s;mall villages, mu&s;t work at a great di&s;tance from their hou&s;es, as men do with us, who work in meadows. Suppo&s;ing this to be the ca&s;e, no wonder all were killed, who were in the field, for it is certain no one could have lived, if he had been obliged to go but a &s;mall di&s;tance in this &s;torm.&mdash;Be&s;ide this, the Egyptians were not u&s;ed to the cold, which would kill them much &s;ooner than it would the hardy &s;ons of America, who are inured to heat and cold, with its various changes; but in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e it was al|mo&s;t too hard for &s;ome con&s;titutions. This &s;torm la&s;ted but a few minutes, and that la&s;ted &s;ome time.</P>
<P>From all the&s;e circum&s;tances, it is no ways &s;trange, that man and bea&s;t both died, allowing that it was not &s;o &s;evere as the pre&s;ent one.</P>
<P>If any of my readers are not &s;atisfied with the de&s;crip|tion, which I have given of Egypt, I wi&s;h them to view the travels of Doctors Pocoke and Shaw, Me&s;&s;rs. Thomp|&s;on, Bruce, and others.</P>

The next that is mentioned in Scripture, happened in the land of Pale&s;tine, forty years after that in Egypt, which was in the year 1451, and is thus recorded in the book of Jo&s;hua, at the Xth chap. and the 11th ver&s;e&mdash;"And it came to pa&s;s as they fled from before I&s;rael and were going down to Beth-horon, that JEHOVAH ca&s;t down great hail &s;tones from heaven upon them unto Aze|kah, and they died: there were more which died with hail &s;tones than they which the children of I&s;rael &s;lew with the &s;word.</P>
<P>In both the&s;e &s;torms many lives were lo&s;t, but I would remark that it is no evidence the &s;torms were more &s;evere. It was the expre&s;s purpo&s;e, for which GOD rained it up|on them. In the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, he did not de&s;ign it for the purpo&s;e of de&s;troying the people, but herbage and fruits of the earth. When judgments an&s;wer the end, for which they are de&s;igned, it is &s;ufficient. One que&s;tion I would a&s;k, and that is, would not the &s;laughter have been great, had the pre&s;ent &s;torm been rained on a flying army, for the &s;pace of a whole day?</P>
<P>I could produce more from the &s;acred pages, but I will now turn to what is called profane hi&s;tory, after making one remark, which is this; there are many things, which are &s;poken in &s;cripture as certain to be fulfilled, which are not more improbable than what has happened before our eyes, and yet even Chri&s;tians doubt of their being ful|filled, and &s;piritualize away the literal meaning of them, which tends greatly to injure the belief in, and reputation of the bible.</P>
<P>Diodorus, a very great hi&s;torian, &s;peaks of hail &s;tones, which weighed a pound and more.&mdash;Philo&s;tori|gus mentions hail, which weighed eight pounds. Tho&s;e writings, left by the philo&s;ophers, who lived in the early ages of the world are very often doubted, and true, we have not &s;o much rea&s;on to give the &s;ame credit to them as we do to tho&s;e which are e&s;teemed the &s;acred oracles of Divine truth; yet we ought to do them the ju&s;tice, to a&s;k our&s;elves whether the &s;ame cau&s;e, which would pro|duce a hail &s;tone of the bigne&s;s of a goo&s;e egg would not produce one of a pound or eight pounds weight, provid|ing the cau&s;e was increa&s;ed in proportion to the effect.</P>
<P>I will now turn to modern hi&s;tory. Arthur Young, a very credible Author, who travelled through France, in the years 1707, 1788, and 1789, in order to make ob&s;erva|tions
<PB N="20" REF="035405_0018_1004BA2626844A60">on the climate, and gain a knowledge of agricul|ture, after &s;peaking of the climate, in the Province of Touraine, Limo&s;in and Bourbonoi&s;e, as being the mo&s;t &s;alubrious, temperate, and healthful places in the world, &s;ays they &s;uffer very much from &s;evere &s;torms of rain and hail.</P>
<P>"Two years ago one violent &s;torm of hail &s;wept a track of de&s;olation, in a belt acro&s;s the whole Kingdom, to the damage of &s;everal millions &s;terling. Such extend|ed ruin is not common, for if it were, the fine&s;t Kingdoms would be laid wa&s;te; but no year pa&s;&s;es without whole pari&s;hes &s;uffering, to a degree of which we have no con|ception, and to the amount of no incon&s;iderable propor|tion of the whole produce of the Kingdom.</P>
<P>"It appears, from my friend Dr. Symonds's paper on the climate of Italy, that the mi&s;chief of hail is dreadful to the utmo&s;t. I have heard it calculated in the South of France, that the damage in &s;ome Provinces amounted to one tenth part of the whole produce of them, on an av|erage. A few days before my arrival at Barbe&s;ieux, there had fallen at the Duke de la Rochefoucault's &s;eat in the Agoumoi&s;e, and &s;ome neighbouring pari&s;hes, a &s;hower of hail, that did not leave a &s;ingle grape on the vines, and cut them &s;o &s;everely as to preclude all hope of a crop the year following, and allowed no well founded expect|ations of any beneficial produce, even the third year. In another place gee&s;e were killed, by the &s;ame &s;torm; young colts were &s;o much wounded that they died after|wards. It is even a&s;&s;erted, that men were killed by it, when unable to obtain any &s;helter. This &s;torm de&s;troyed a cop&s;e of the duke's that were of two years' growth, with &s;uch effects it mu&s;t be obvious to every one, that all &s;orts of corn and pul&s;e mu&s;t be de&s;troyed." This &s;torm happened in the &s;ummer of 1787.&mdash;<HI>Arthur Young's Travels, vol.</HI> II.</P>
<P>The provinces, which I have mentioned, lie near the Pyrennean mountains, between France and Italy.</P>
<P>I will now mention one of a later date. In Augu&s;t 1792, there was a mo&s;t violent tornado and hurricane in the &s;tate of Vermont, which ended in a hail &s;torm. This &s;torm began near Lake Champlain, on Onion river, and took its cour&s;e &s;outh, till it met what is called the Hog|backs, which are high lands on the north of &s;aid river.&mdash;This mountain parted the cloud; part of it went to the
<PB N="21" REF="035405_0019_1004BA27CB5F0E78">S. W. and lo&s;t it&s;elf on the highland, the other took a di|rection about S. E. and increa&s;ed into a violent tornado and hurricane. Where it was confined among the moun|tains it was a proper whirlwind, twi&s;ting off the large&s;t trees in the fore&s;t, in &s;ome places. Where it was not, it took more of a direct line, and was more like a hurricane. On or near the highlands, the tornado became violent, laying pro&s;trate every thing before it. Happily this was in the fore&s;t, where there were no inhabitants. Soon after this, hail &s;tones began to fall, which were as large as hen's eggs. This &s;torm continued fifteen or twenty miles, &s;cattering its icy contents on the towns of Thetford, Lyme, and many other places. The hail &s;tones were rough, like tho&s;e which I have mentioned. This &s;torm was more than 100 miles in length, but abated &s;oon after the hail began to fall; when it came into a more open country. This cloud appeared very black, and the roar was ince&s;|&s;ant. I was not in the &s;torm, but was on a vi&s;it near the place, weere I could view the cloud and hear the roar of it, and had the above information from gentlemen, on who&s;e veracity I could rely.</P>
<P>From the foregoing ob&s;ervations, we &s;ee that tho&s;e who have been vi&s;ited with the late &s;torm are not the only people, who have been doomed to &s;ee their fields de&s;olat|ed by the &s;ame elements, which &s;erve to make them fruit|ful, when kept in perfect uni&s;on with each other.</P>
<P>Tornado at Bozrah, on the 2d of Augu&s;t, 1799.</P>
<P>Friday morning, Augu&s;t 2d, the day was u&s;hered in with a thick clouded atmo&s;phere, which about 10 o'clock A. M. a&s;&s;umed an appearance, as if pregnant with &s;cenes of di&s;tre&s;s, like tho&s;e which happened a few days &s;ince, and very much alarmed tho&s;e, who were &s;pectators of it. The clouds &s;eemed in confu&s;ion, and ru&s;hed to the N. E. The lightning was extremely &s;harp, and in&s;tantly follow|ed with heavy thunder; peal an&s;wered to peal, which kept vibrating in our ears for &s;ome time, attended with heavy rain, and a few &s;mall hail &s;tones fell, of the &s;ize of hail in winter. After the &s;torm, I heard there had been a tornado about three miles di&s;tant I went and viewed it, and obtained as accurate information as I could, from a number of gentlemen, who were men of information.&mdash;It was fir&s;t di&s;covered on the Great Pond (alias) Gardner's Pond, which is in the S. W. part of the town of Bozrah, and took its cour&s;e from S. W. to N. E. and followed
<PB N="22" REF="035405_0020_1004BA29A3A03570">the brook, which runs out of the pond, and is called the pond brook; after it had pa&s;&s;ed about three fourths of a mile it became violent, laying pro&s;trate almo&s;t every thing before it, for three miles and a half, when it went into a heavy grove of wood, at the mouth of the brook, where it empties into Deep river. This grove &s;eemed to break it, &s;o that it did no damage more than 100 or 150 rods to the ea&s;tward of it. It began about three fourths of a mile farther ea&s;t than the hail &s;torm, and left a &s;pace un|touched by either of that width, where they ran parallel with each other. In its width, it was from 60 to 140 rods. The pond on which it began, is &s;urrounded by a country which gradually ri&s;es on every &s;ide, except to the N. E; where the pond brook has its &s;ource. The water of the pond is quite warm; con&s;idering the bigne&s;s of it, which is three miles in length, and about one and a half in breadth. The brook, like all others, is covered on both &s;ides by ri&s;|ing ground.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not undertake to philo&s;ophize on this, but leave it for a more able pen. I &s;hall now mention the effects of it. It pa&s;&s;ed through the centre of the town, which is a beautiful, fertile country, and laid wa&s;te &s;ome of the fin|e&s;t orchards in the country; the trees lay in every direc|tion. I was informed that there were more than &s;ix hun|dred apple trees blown down, and the &s;turdy oak had to yield in its turn. Many buildings were damaged, and &s;ome almo&s;t entirely demoli&s;hed. Mr. Jabez Hough, had one barn unroofed, Mr. Jabez Hough, jun. two barns blown down, and his hou&s;e partly unroofed. Mr. Ebenezer Hough's hou&s;e blown to pieces. Capt. Ran|dall's barn unroofed, and hou&s;e injured; &s;ome of the &s;hin|gles and clapboards were carried &s;everal miles. The greate&s;t damage was their orchards.</P>
<P>The wonderful di&s;plays of Omnipotent power and goodne&s;s to mankind have formed, and been the &s;ubject of mo&s;t of the books which have been written for the ben|efit of them. In vain have many eminent Divines faith|fully laboured in the vineyard of their Ma&s;ter, to con|vince the world of their entire dependence on him, who made man, to reverence and obey his Creator. I &s;ay ma|ny have laboured in vain, becau&s;e man is not convinced of this truth; that the Almighty di&s;pen&s;es his judgments with an equal hand, and di&s;po&s;es of events as he choo&s;es, and giveth not an account of his matters. He &s;aith of
<PB N="23" REF="035405_0021_1004BA2EA6DDBCD0">Pharaoh, "And in very deed, for this cau&s;e have I rai&s;ed thee up, to &s;hew in thee my power; and that my name may be declared throughout all the earth." From this, it is evident that the&s;e things are &s;ent to us, creatures, to make us &s;en&s;ible of our dependance on the former and fa&s;hioner of our mortal bodies. It appears that GOD had u&s;ed means to reclaim the Egpytians from their idolatrous and wicked practices, by &s;ending them a variety of the mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;&s;ing judgments that had ever been &s;ent on the world of mankind; &s;till &s;ending them greater and heavier judgments, and the Egyptians increa&s;ing in wickedne&s;s, not feeling any gratitude to their GOD for the pre&s;erva|tion of their lives in the mid&s;t of &s;uch dangers. It is true they would &s;eem to repent, while they thir&s;ted for water, or were covered with &s;ores, and their kneading troughs filled with filthy vermine and reptiles; but no &s;ooner were they removed, than they returned to their old cour&s;e of wickedne&s;s, and forgot their former trou|bles, for which rea&s;on GOD &s;pake unto them by Mo&s;es, &s;aying; "For now I will &s;tretch out my hand, that I may &s;mite thee and thy people with pe&s;tilence; and thou &s;halt be cut off from the earth. Behold, to morrow about this time, I will cau&s;e it to rain a very grievous hail, &s;uch as hath not been in Egypt &s;ince the foundation thereof, even until now."</P>
<P>Judgments of all kinds, &s;hew us the ab&s;olute omnipo|tence of Deity; yet man is a being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a variety of &s;en&s;es, which &s;erve to convey ideas to his mind, and con&s;equently tho&s;e ideas make the mo&s;t la&s;ting impre&s;|&s;ions, which fall with the greate&s;t weight on his internal &s;en&s;es, and it &s;eems nothing could fall with a greater weight on the &s;en&s;es of the Egyptians than hail, lightning and thunder. For tho&s;e who never &s;aw &s;o much as a &s;hower of rain fall on the earth, to &s;ee the air filled with &s;olid &s;ub&s;tances, that killed and brake every thing on which it fell, and &s;treams of livid fire running on the ground like &s;erpents, and were u&s;hered in with the ele|mental voice of thunder, which was a new and dreadful &s;ound to the Egyptians. What could appear with more &s;olemn pomp, and awful maje&s;ty than this! The giving of the law at Mount Sinai, was not attended with more di&s;plays of omnipotence than the plagues of Egypt.</P>
<P>It is true it requires the &s;ame omnipotent power to produce a &s;pire of gra&s;s, that it does to remove a moun|tain,
<PB N="24" REF="035405_0022_1004BA303303FB78">or to bring into <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> reptile, as the mo&s;t perfect man; yet <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> of the former with calm indiffere<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="3 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> with the lat|ter. The judgment of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> and thunder, it &s;eems, mu&s;t appear as gr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="3 letters"> and fill their minds with as much awe and reverence, as any that could be in|flicted on them. We find that the mo&s;t &s;trong figures of GOD's awful judgments on the world, are repre&s;ented by great hail &s;tones, fire and brim&s;tone. Notwith&s;tanding all this, the Egyptians became hardened under their afflic|tions, which is a &s;tanding monument of the depravity of human nature.</P>
<P>On taking a cur&s;ory view of the &s;ubject, we are apt to &s;ay, what wicked and idolatrous &s;et of men, that &s;hould &s;o long abu&s;e and oppre&s;s the people of GOD, when they &s;aw his immediate hand executing his judgments upon them for their wickedne&s;s; but what is our &s;urprize, when we come to a view of the conduct of the people, who were favoured with as many &s;ignal ble&s;&s;ings, for whom GOD wrought all the&s;e miracles&mdash;dividing the Red Sea for them&mdash;directing them by day and night&mdash;making a covenant with them in the mo&s;t &s;olemn manner. This was a mo&s;t &s;olemn covenant; the preliminaries were drawn up, and then read in the hearing of all the people. They con&s;ent|ed to it: then Mo&s;es took the blood of the &s;acrifice and &s;prinkled it on the people and on the book, thereby &s;eal|ing it in the mo&s;t &s;olemn manner. After all this, no &s;ooner was Mo&s;es ab&s;ent a longer time than u&s;ual, than they went and made a calf&mdash;wor&s;hipped it: and even the high prie&s;t him&s;elf had the wickedne&s;s to go and make this image, in order that the people might wor&s;hip it.</P>
<P>A&s;toni&s;hing &s;tupidity! This was &s;o &s;candalous a tran&s;|action, that Jo&s;ephus (being a&s;hamed of it in his nation) has left it out of his hi&s;tory. Now, which of the two was guilty of the greate&s;t &s;tupidity and wickedne&s;s; the E|gyptians, or the children of I&s;rael? In the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, let us examine our&s;elves&mdash;is not our land corrupted? has not vice become fa&s;hionable among us? are not our hearts corrupted? have we not got an idol &s;et up in them as much as the children of I&s;rael or the Egyptians had? have we not &s;omething be&s;ide the mercy of GOD, and merits of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, by which we mean to be &s;aved? Let us examine our&s;elves, and &s;ee if we offer a pure &s;acrifice up|on the altar? are we not more fond of being thought &s;trict
<PB N="25" REF="035405_0023_1004BA31EB1E2D70">ob&s;erver of external duties, than we are of being friendly to tho&s;e who are in di&s;tre&s;s, thereby making our fellow men more happy? What does the Saviour of mankind &s;ay in this re&s;pect? I was hungry and ye gave me no meat, thir&s;ty, and ye gave me no drink, naked, and ye cloth|ed me not. They &s;aid unto him, when &s;aw we thee hun|gry or thir&s;ty, and did not admini&s;ter unto thee. He &s;aid, in as much as ye have not done it unto the&s;e, ye have not done it unto me? If we cannot feed the hungry, clothe the naked, vi&s;it the &s;ick, &amp;c. if we cannot do this, how can we a&s;k it of him who gives us all things, or are we better than our neighbours? Where is the man who can &s;tand forth and &s;ay to his GOD, I am better than my neighbour? Let not this Phari&s;aic di&s;po&s;ition ari&s;e in our hearts and &s;ay, were tho&s;e eighteen Gallileans on whom the tower Siloam has fallen&mdash;are they &s;inners above all others? I tell you nay! Except ye repent, ye &s;hall all likewi&s;e peri&s;h. To &s;ay this is ingratitude, is a &s;in which I think is predominant in the land at the pre&s;ent day.</P>
<P>Love and charity are wanting, both toward GOD and man. If ye have faith to remove mountains, and have not charity ye are nothing, &s;aith the apo&s;tle. Charity is the bond of perfection. We may practi&s;e all the inter|nal duties in religion, and yet be void of any love to|ward GOD, or our neighbour&mdash;the&s;e are duties which will not co&s;t any thing. When the ble&s;&s;ed Je&s;us &s;aid to the young man, &s;ell what thou ha&s;t and give to the poor, then come and follow me, we find that he went away &s;orrowful, for he had great po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. He had every thing but charity. Except we have charity we cannot be the di&s;ciples of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Had Chri&s;tians more benevolence, charity and kindne&s;s towards each other, it would be well. I have no doubt but Chri&s;tianity would have been more univer&s;ally believed than it is, had it not been for the Chri&s;tian nations treating each other as they have done. There was a coun&s;el of the mo&s;t learned Jews held about one hundred and fifty years &s;ince. When each one had produced the record of his family and took his &s;eat in the council, the &s;crip|tures were read. Then each one brought forward his candidate to be acknowledged as the Me&s;&s;iah. The fir&s;t thing was an examination into their moral characters, and their appearance in the world. A number had been ex|amined,
<PB N="26" REF="035405_0024_1004BA355DC9DAC0">and it was found, their morals were in &s;ome de|gree corrupted. At length the Romi&s;h church brought for|ward Je&s;us Chri&s;t as their candidate, and on examination they con&s;ented that he might be the Me&s;&s;iah, but they &s;aid, where are his followers? and on examining into the behaviour of the church of Rome, and finding what cru|elty they had u&s;ed toward other nations, and what wick|edne&s;s was practi&s;ed by tho&s;e nations who profe&s;&s;ed this religion; they &s;aid, &s;urely this cannot be the Me&s;&s;iah&mdash;and the council broke up, after determining for them|&s;elves, that the Me&s;&s;iah had not come. "Love is made for a law of the moral world as gravitation is of the mate|rial world, and would be as uniformly obeyed, was it not for the Moral agency of man." The pre&s;ent &s;torm af|fords an opportunity of trying charity and putting of it to the te&s;t. When objects of charity pre&s;ent them&s;elves, we are apt to &s;ay they are indolent, idle vagabonds, or they might be as well off as I am, if by fire or &s;ickne&s;s, they are di&s;tre&s;&s;ed and apply for relief&mdash;we &s;ay I have opportunities enough to give away what I have, without giving of it to a &s;tranger; let his neighbours do for him; now his neighbours &s;ay, I have helped him enough be|fore, let people at large do for him; &s;o the poor object is thrown from his neighbour to the &s;tranger, and from the &s;tranger to his neighbour. Again, and he might look for man|na from Heaven as &s;oon as charity from people of &s;uch a di&s;po&s;ition? How many are found among us of this tem|per of mind. In the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, all excu&s;es are taken off. Here are objects enough to afford you all an opportuni|ty of be&s;towing your charity. Here are many who by dint of indu&s;try have lived and &s;upported their families, and now unle&s;s a&s;&s;i&s;tance is afforded them, they mu&s;t &s;ell their lands and eat it up to &s;upport them till another harve&s;t is ready, and when that comes they have neither land nor harve&s;t. Here are others who have more land than enough to &s;upport them, to remedy the wor&s;t of evils, that of coming to poverty, they mu&s;t &s;ell their lands and re|tire into the wilderne&s;s with the little remains of fortune, where they can obtain land enough to &s;upport them&s;elves. They mu&s;t now leave their friends and acquaintance, which is more trying than even death it&s;elf. Deprive man of a friend and in regard to happine&s;s he is below the lowe&s;t of the brutal creation. Perhaps my reader may think I am &s;ome way intere&s;ted in the benevolence of the
<PB N="27" REF="035405_0025_1004BA39705B74A0">public towards the &s;ufferers? But I am not, in any other way, than I &s;ee my fellow men di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, for I am not a &s;ufferer by it. Where is the man who would not wil|lingly &s;pare one dollar out of an hundred, rather than &s;ee any of his fellow men reduced to this nece&s;&s;ity, by an un|avoidable misfortune, to which we are equally expo&s;ed. Now let the man who&s;e heart glows with gratitude for the rich ble&s;&s;ings of an abundant harve&s;t &s;ay what is the &s;ituation of my brother? his fields are like a barren de&s;ert, his cattle are without hay, his wife and children are without bread? Shall my heart exult in this idea, while my brother is in want of &s;uperabundant goods of fortune which I have received from the &s;ame common parent? Have I not &s;omething which I can &s;pare without injury to my&s;elf or family? Let no one &s;ay I pity them and withhold his hand, or &s;ay, I would &s;end them a bu&s;hel of grain if I could, but let him a&s;k his neighbour if he does not wi&s;h to help them. If you do, I will pre&s;ume to &s;ay you will find generous hearted men in every town who will be willing to help make up a load for a hor&s;e or &s;leigh. I fear the di&s;tre&s;s of the poor will be very great before another har|ve&s;t is produced; but from the kindne&s;s and liberality of their neighbours. I flatter my&s;elf they will be helped from a generous public, and if any gentleman &s;hould be &s;o inclined who lives at a di&s;tance, I would recommend Me&s;&s;rs. William Huntington, jun. John Howard and Benjamin B. Fitch, as men with whom they may depo&s;it any thing, and depend that it will be properly di&s;tribut|ed among the &s;ufferers.</P>
<P>It &s;eems GOD has given to &s;ome and taken it from oth|ers, thereby making us his Stewards for each other, and how happy mu&s;t it be for the noble to receive the grate|ful look of the receiver. Whil&s;t his heart glows with gratitude to the giver, give therefore and let the hearts of the giver and receiver rejoice together.</P>
<P>Let it not be &s;aid of America as of Poland, that love and Charity are only known by name.</P>
