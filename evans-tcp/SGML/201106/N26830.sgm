<HEAD>The Par&s;on and the Fowls; or the Maid too cunning for her Ma&s;ter.</HEAD>
<P>A RICH old batchelor, a clergyman in the country, having made choice of a pretty young maid to his hou&s;e-keeper, had ordered upon a certain Sunday, a couple of fowls to be got ready for his dinner, that after he had given his con|gregation a little Chri&s;tian con&s;olation at church, he might come home and re|fre&s;h his tired vitals with a dainty mo|dicum. When the clerk and his looby a&s;&s;i&s;tant, had chimed almo&s;t for about a quarter of an hour, and jogged the &s;hepherd to fodder his &s;heep, and mea|&s;ure his time by the &s;and gla&s;s, his pretty hou&s;ekeeper was left te prepare the cack|lers again&s;t the cu&s;tomary time of his return.</P>
<P>The diligent maid when &s;he thought her gho&s;tly ma&s;ter had been long enough exalted two degrees above the clerk, to get about a quarter of an hour on the right &s;ide of his text, gue&s;&s;ed it a very proper time to lay down the fowls, which &s;he did accordingly. As the tid-bits were
<PB N="4" REF="035716_0003_100654780D39F0C8">running merrily round before a rouzing fire, who &s;hould take the advantage of the par&s;on's ab&s;ence, but his hou&s;e-keepers &s;weet-heart, who by his plea&s;ant and com|ical hoity toities, and other winning ac|compli&s;hments, had &s;o wriggled him&s;elf into her affections, that it is not unrea|&s;onable to think he had as much com|mand of her as her ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>The maid having mi&s;taken the time of day, happened to be a little too early with her cookery, &s;o that the fowls were fully ready, before the par&s;on had given his hungry auditory leave to re|turn home to their puddings and dump|lings. The &s;weet-heart being a fellow of an incomparable &s;tomach, thought it a great pity &s;uch good victuals &s;hould be &s;poiled for want of eating, and very eagerly &s;olicited his loving jug to &s;pare him one of the fowls to &s;top a little hole he had in his appetite, telling, her, one would be &s;ufficient for her ma&s;ter, and that &s;he had wit enough to contrive &s;ome &s;tory or other, hand&s;omely to ex|cu&s;e the matter, and blind him from the true knowledge of what became of it.</P>
<P>The maid being willing to oblige her lover, who &s;he found was &s;o de&s;irous to
<PB N="5" REF="035716_0003_100654780D39F0C8">oblige her on all occa&s;ions, ventured to take up one to &s;ave the longing of her &s;weet-heart, who, being very well pre|pared for &s;uch a nice enterta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nment, gobbled it up with &s;uch expedition that before his benefactre&s;s had wound up the jack, he had not &s;o much as left the claws which the poor cockril u&s;ed to &s;cratch the dunghill withal.</P>
<P>He had no &s;ooner thus di&s;patched his &s;weet-heart's fir&s;t courte&s;y; but he began to be very importunate with her for the &s;econd telling her an excu&s;e was as ea&s;ily made for both as for one; and that &s;he had as good be h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> for a &s;heep as a lamb: till at la&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ding a few melt|ing ki&s;&s;es to h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">enous &s;olicitations, he prevailed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> her to draw the other off the &s;pit, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e might fini&s;h his meal by robbing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> par&s;on of his Sunday's dinner. The &s;econd bird being brought before him, he lo&s;t no time, but drove down the former with the latter, with|out any vi&s;ible abatement of either his &s;peed or his appetite. When he had cleared his di&s;h, and wa&s;hed all down with a cup of the par&s;on's be&s;t beer, he took a thankful leave of his mi&s;tre&s;s,
<PB N="6" REF="035716_0004_10065479950C7D20">who now began to be at her wit's end how to excu&s;e the rudene&s;s &s;he had &s;o fooli&s;hly committed.</P>
<P>As &s;he was thus pondering with her|&s;elf, who &s;hould &s;tep in but the par&s;on and a &s;tranger with him, who coming from another town to hear him preach, the par&s;on thought him&s;elf obliged to invite him home to dinner with him.</P>

When, if you had known him, you might have ea&s;ily di&s;covered by his countenance, he is in one of his old frieks." "Why, what's the matter with him?" &s;ays the country farmer, "he was wondrous civil to me in the church yard, and by
<PB N="7" REF="035716_0004_10065479950C7D20">all means would bring me home to dine with him." "Alas! good Sir," replied the maid, whatever you do, let me advi&s;e you to make the be&s;t of your way out of the hou&s;e, for if you &s;tay, now he is in one of his frenzical humours, he will cer|tainly geld you, and I dare &s;ay he is whetting his knife for the &s;ame purpo&s;e, he has &s;erved too or three &s;o already, though they have had di&s;cretion to keep it &s;ilent becau&s;e they would not be laugh|ed at."

<HEAD>The Lady's Complaint again&s;t the Mer|chant for running away with the Pump.</HEAD>
<P>A Turkey merchant travelling on the road about 20 miles from London, happened to be overtaken by bad weather a little before night, and having no pro&s;|pect of a tavern to have recour&s;e to for &s;helter, being a man of figure, he re&s;olved to beg admittance at the fir&s;t hou&s;e he came to, to avoid the &s;everity of the en|crea&s;ing &s;torm; he had not gallopped on a furlong further, but he came to a pretty neat box, which &s;tood by the high way &s;ide, where he beheld a very beau|tiful lady looking out of a window upon which he rode up to the door, and ap|plying him&s;elf to the lady at the ca&s;e|ment humbly begged her to take pity up|on a di&s;tre&s;&s;ed traveller, and that &s;he would be &s;o kind as to give him a recepti|on till the violance of the &s;torm was blown
<PB N="10" REF="035716_0006_1006547E19BCDE00">over, or abated; the compa&s;&s;ionate lady di&s;cerning him to be a gentleman, &s;oon granted his reque&s;t, and ordered her &s;er|vant to admit her weather-beaten &s;up|plicant, and to take care of his hor&s;e; he had no &s;ooner taken &s;anctuary in his little paradi&s;e, as he thought it, but a rou&s;ing fire was kindled in the parlour, and a cap, nightgown, &s;hirt, &s;lippers, and all conveniences were brought him for &s;hiftng off his wet apparrel, and putting him&s;elf into a more comfortable condition.</P>
<P>When he had thus refre&s;hed his body with a good fire, and a dry garment, he pre&s;ented his &s;ervice to the lady by her waiting maid, and humbly craved leave to pay his re&s;pects to the lady, and that &s;he would honour him with an op|portunity of returning her thanks for the great and charitable obligation &s;he had conferred upon him. No &s;ooner was the me&s;&s;age delivered, but the generous lady very readily ble&s;&s;ed him with her com|pany: after he had attacked her ears with a whole volley of compliments and di&s;charged him&s;elf at her entrance very much like a gentleman, &s;he called for a bottle of canary, and ordered a very agreeable cold entertainment to be
<PB N="11" REF="035716_0006_1006547E19BCDE00">brought in, till &s;omething was provided hot, that might be more acceptable.</P>
<P>By this time the gentleman pre&s;umed &s;o far, as to a&s;k the lady if &s;he was married, who an&s;wered in the negative, further telling him, "That &s;he was obliged to a gentleman, who was her pe|culiar friend for her re&s;idence in that hou&s;e who was gone a long journey into Scotland, and that &s;he did not expect him back this &s;ix weeks; and withal, a&s;|&s;ured him, &s;ince the weather proved &s;o bad, he &s;hould be very welcome to &s;tay all night if it &s;uited with his conveni|ency." The gentleman being a jolly juvenile &s;park, and very amorou&s;ly in|clined, had no power to refu&s;e &s;o kind an invitation from &s;o fair a lady, but made a facetious acknowledgment of her favour, and thankfully accepted of her obliging proffer; and to prevent any mi&s;tru&s;t that, upon more mature deliberation, &s;he might have of his being &s;ome de&s;igning per&s;on, he plucks a letter out of his pocket, directed to him at his hou&s;e in London, from Sir R. J&mdash;, a ju&s;tice of peace in the city, which had been &s;ent him about three days before by the penny po&s;t, the lady
<PB N="12" REF="035716_0007_1006547FF3E1B530">read it over with abundance of attenti|on, making him a compliment when &s;he had done, viz, "That there needed nothing further than his appearance to prove him a gentlemen."</P>
<P>The merchant, as he had good rea|&s;on, believing her to be a lady in keep|ing began to take heart of grace, and to treat her after &s;uch an amorous man|ner, that was &s;ufficient to let her under|&s;tand he expected, as certainly as he lay there that night, that &s;he &s;hould be his bed-fellow; &s;o that when &s;upper was over, having prepared her with a few melting ki&s;&s;es, and other &s;o&s;tening preliminaries, he took the freedom to make her &s;en&s;ible of the unexpre&s;&s;ible happine&s;s he had the hopes of enjoy|ing; to which &s;he &s;eemed neither very aver&s;e, nor vet over forward, but cum|ningly &s;ignified, after a bifarous man|ner, that &s;he wanted &s;ome further in|ducement than barely love and oppor|tunity to bring her to a compliance; upon which, the merchant being an intelligent man &s;oon di&s;covered her meaning, and being clevated by her charms and dalliance to the highe&s;t pitch of de&s;ire, told her that he had no
<PB N="13" REF="035716_0007_1006547FF3E1B530">pre&s;ent about him worthy of her accept|ance; but if at any time, when &s;he came to London, &s;he would give her&s;elf the trouble to &s;end for him to any ta|vern, he would be extremely glad to wait on her, and that he would pre|&s;ent her with fifty guineas to buy her a diamond ring, if &s;he would do him the honour to wear it for his &s;ake. She &s;eemingly took but &s;light notice of his generous offer; but however began to &s;hift off her former coyne&s;s, and liplead him into a pretty good a&s;&s;urance that he had gained the point, and at la&s;t con|de&s;cended &s;o far as to promi&s;e him her &s;avours, which was no &s;ooner done, but a convenient bed of re&s;ignation was ordered to be &s;heeted next to her own chamber, whither he could have an ea&s;y recour&s;e at midnight without the notice e&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">her &s;ervants.</P>
<P>When all things were in readine&s;s, the merchant ha&s;ted to his pillow, thinking every minute an age till the bu&s;ine&s;s was con&s;ummated; when all things were hu&s;h the &s;ervants gone to bed, and the oppor|tunity proved &s;ea&s;onable, the lady was as good as her word, and nothing but
<PB N="14" REF="035716_0008_100654840F0D8FB8">Sallengers Round was reciprocally danced till both parties were rather tired than &s;atisfied. About day break, the lady bade him good morrow and returned to her own bed, leaving her wearied lover to refre&s;h him&s;elf with a little &s;leep after his hard night's Journey, when three or four hours repo&s;e had enabled him to ri&s;e, up he got, and recovering his lo&s;s of &s;pirits with a plentiful cup of mulled Canary he returned the lady abundance of thanks for her compa&s;&s;ionate favours, di&s;charged him&s;elf hand&s;omly of the &s;ervants and &s;o proceeded on his Journey.</P>
<P>About a month after the lady came to town? and according to her lover's directions, made bold to &s;end for him to a certain tavern no great di&s;tance from his own hou&s;e; but the gentleman re|collecting what an extravagant promi&s;e he had made the lady in requital of her favours, thought it the wi&s;e&s;t way to neglect going; accordingly &s;ent back word, "That he was very bu&s;y, and could not po&s;&s;ibly wait on her;" which provoking &s;light, after the pretence of &s;o much kindne&s;s, ju&s;tly kindled in the lady, &s;uch a revengeful indignation, that her nimble wits had &s;oon formed a
<PB N="15" REF="035716_0008_100654840F0D8FB8">project how &s;he &s;hould be even with him, re&s;olving to put her de&s;ign in prac|tice with all expedition.</P>
<P>Accordingly &s;he takes coach, and or|ders the coachman to drive her to Sir Robert J&mdash;, a known Ju&s;tice of Peace, and the very gentleman who &s;ent the letter to the merchant which he had &s;hewn to the lady; Sir Robert being at home and at lei&s;ure &s;he was &s;oon admit|ted to acquaint the ju&s;tice with her bu&s;ine&s;s, who told him that &s;he had a great complaint again&s;t his friend Mr. Hazard. The ju&s;tice &s;eemed much &s;ur|prized that &s;o pretty a lady &s;hould ap|pear as an enemy again&s;t his friend, whom he thought to be a man of un|&s;potted reputation, and de&s;ired to know what &s;he had to charge him with, up|on which the injured lady laid open her grievances thus, "Your friend Mr. Hazard, the merchant, not long &s;ince took of me a very plea&s;ant little tene|ment, which he was to occupy without any let, hindrance, or mole&s;tation, for a certain term agreed on between both parties, in con&s;ideration of the &s;um of fifty guine as, which he was to pay me on demand; and after; he had enjoyed
<PB N="16" REF="035716_0009_10065485ACFD70D8">the premi&s;es with all its appurtenances, the full time of agreement, he quitted the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion very di&s;honourably, and now hides him&s;elf from me, becau&s;e he would not pay me the money." Madam," replied the Ju&s;tice. "I am very &s;orry to hear the&s;e things of a gen|tleman who is my friend, and a per&s;on, that has always enjoyed &s;o fair a char|acter; but however, madam, the&s;e are matters that come within the cognizance of the common law, &s;o that they are not properly within my &s;phere to med|dle with, but this &s;ervice I can do you: if you plea&s;e, madam, I will &s;end for him, and if, upon hearing both &s;ides, I find he has done you wrong I will pur|&s;uade him all that I can to do you ju&s;|tice. The lady approved of this propo&s;al, and thanked him for his civility, according|ly Sir Robert di&s;patched his footman with a me&s;&s;age to Mr. Hazard, which brought him pre&s;ently before his fair accufer. who repeated over her former complaint before the face of the offender; the merchant at fir&s;t was much &s;urpri&s;ed to find him&s;elf &s;ent for upon this occa&s;ion, till perceiving the lady had &s;o wittily couched her ac|cu&s;ation under &s;uch a mode&s;t allegory
<PB N="17" REF="035716_0009_10065485ACFD70D8">and then he thought it be&s;t to acknow|ledge the charge, le&s;t by denying it, he &s;hould provoke the lady to give the ju&s;tice a full explanation of her mean|ing, to his open &s;hame and di&s;honor, &s;o that he confe&s;&s;ed he had taken a tene|ment of her upon &s;uch a con&s;ideration as was alledged. "But Madam," &s;ays he, "you know there was a deep well belong|ing to this tenement, which wanted a pump, whithout which you are &s;en&s;ible the tenement would have been of no u&s;e to me; therefore &s;ince I was at the ex|pence of putting up &s;uch a conveniency, I think it is but ju&s;tice you &s;hould make a rea&s;onable abatement, "But Sir," replied the lady, "you mu&s;t con&s;ider, when you quitted the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, that you took the pump along with you; had you left the pump &s;tanding that I could have had the u&s;e of it when I had &s;een occa&s;ion, I &s;hould now be very willing to allow any deduction; but &s;ince you put up the pump for your own plea&s;ure, and carried it away with you when you left the tenement. I think it but rea&s;on I &s;hould have my full money." "Well Madam," replies the gentleman, "be
<PB N="18" REF="035716_0010_10065487D41E6018">cau&s;e you &s;hall have no ju&s;t rea&s;on to &s;ay I have dealt hardly to a fair lady, I promi&s;e you before I part with you, to pay your full money, and to lend you the pump into the bargain, provided you will take care never to abu&s;e it!" The lady punctually promi&s;ed "it &s;hould never be the wor&s;e of her wearing." So taking leave of Sir Robert, he waited upon the lady to the next tavern, in or|cer to lend her the pump, and pay her the money.</P>

<HEAD>Thirty thou&s;and Pounds bid for a Pair of Band Strings; or the two Precious Stones pre&s;ented to a rich Widow.</HEAD>
<P>A RICH old alderman of the city of London that dealt in the interloping trade to the Ea&s;t-ladies, having a pretty young gentleman to his nephew, who had been bred under him; and being willing to give him an opportunity of rai&s;ing his fortune, &s;ent him abroad as a &s;upercargo, and withal gave him a thou&s;and pounds to improve him&s;elf with the be&s;t directions he could how to ma|nage it to advantage: but the young gentleman, it being his fir&s;t voyage, met
<PB N="19" REF="035716_0010_10065487D41E6018">with &s;uch unexpected lo&s;&s;es and cro&s;&s;es abroad, that he at la&s;t was forced to re|turn home very unfortunate, and was &s;o far from having added to his uncle's benevolence, that he had quite em|bezzled, not only his own &s;tock, but his uncle's cargo; however, making it appear to the old gentleman, it was more owing to misfortune than extra|vagance: he was very kind and fatherly to his kin&s;man, notwith&s;tanding his di&s;|appointment; and having a young bri&s;k widow lady, to whom he was a ca&s;hier, and for whom he &s;ometimes traded, that u&s;ed often to dine with him, he re&s;olved by a &s;tratagem, to try if he could not recommend his nephew as a per&s;on worthy of her affections, and as a gen|tleman proper to become her hu&s;band.</P>
<P>Accordingly to put his project in prac|tice, he provided him&s;elf with a &s;tout hor&s;ewhip, which he conveyed privately under his cloak, and when thus armed for his de&s;ign, he de&s;ired his nephew's company to the tavern, in order to take part of a &s;mall collation. The young gen|tleman, who was always very fond to obey his uncle, &s;hewed him&s;ef ready in an in&s;tant to an&s;wer his reque&s;t; and

<P>They were no &s;ooner entered, but the uncle de&s;ired a private room above &s;tairs, a quart of claret, and tobacco, ordering the drawer not to &s;uffer any body to di&s;|turb them for half an hour, for that they had &s;ome particular bu&s;ine&s;s to|gether, that would require at lea&s;t that time to be di&s;patched in.</P>
<P>When all things were performed ac|cording to order, and the door &s;hut, the old gentleman commanded his nephew to &s;trip to the &s;hirt, that he might &s;ee what linen he wore, for he had been in|formed he was grown &s;uch a na&s;ty lou&s;y &s;loven, that no body would venture to lie with him.

<P>When he was thus &s;tripped to his &s;hirt the cunning old &s;ly boots, the bet|ter to effects his ends puts on his &s;pec|tacles, and fell to peeping about his wri&s;t-bands and collar, as if, in good earne&s;t, he had been looking for ver|mine, "Come, Sirrah," &s;ays he, "now down with your breeches, let me look in the wa&s;teband, for that's the mo&s;t likely harbour to find &s;uch cattle in." "Lord, Sir," &s;ays the young gentleman, "you command me now beyond mode&s;|ty." "I tell you, Sirrah," replies the uncle, "I will &s;ee what condition you are in, and therefore do as I bid you, or it &s;hall be more out of your way than your head is worth." The nephew know|ing his uncle to be a man of better mo|rals than to have any brutal de&s;ign upon him, for fear of di&s;obliging him, con|de&s;cended to his further reque&s;t, which he had no &s;ooner done but the old cuff fell to peeping in the &s;eams and gathers, as earne&s;tly as if he had no other drift, than to &s;ee if he was lou&s;y; but of a &s;udden, as he was thus &s;earching pretend|edly for the creepers, up he &s;tarts, and
<PB N="22" REF="035716_0012_1006548D925377A0">before the other could pluck up his breeches, he lugs out his hor&s;e-whip, &s;eemingly in a pa&s;&s;ion: "Sirrah," &s;ays he, "your breeches hang, I have heard you whored away your money in Spain and Italy, and that you are returned home with &s;uch damnable pox, that the te&s;timonies of your manhood are &s;welled as big, Sirrah, as a couple of Norfolk dumplings, and I am re&s;olved, before you &s;tir, to know the truth of the matters; therefore lug out your Young Smock Smelling Plugtail, that I may &s;ee your condition, or I will jirk your buttocks with this in&s;trument of cor|rection, till I make your teeth chatter in your cod-piece." The young gentle|man believing from his uncle's pa&s;&s;ion, he had really heard what he told him, between fear and anger, gave the old gentleman the liberty of beholding the premi&s;es, that his own eyes might bear witne&s;s of the fal&s;ehood of the&s;e ba&s;e a&s;per&s;ions.</P>
<P>When the uncle beheld all, according to his judgment, in a &s;ound condition, "Now nephew," &s;ays he, "I have a mind to make a bargain with you, what &s;hall I give you for tho&s;e pair of band &s;trings

"I will give thee," replies the uncle twenty thou&s;and pounds for them, and that's more than they are worth, by con&s;iderable," "Ble&s;s me Sir," replies the nephew, "I would not part with them for forty." "Thou extravagant Ur|chin," cries the old dad, "I will give thee thirty thou&s;and for them, and if you will not take that, you may keep them." "In truth, Sir." returns the young one. "not I, I would not part with them for the univer&s;e." "Then thou maye&s;t e'en dre&s;s thy&s;elf," &s;ays the old Chap, "and button up your ware, for I &s;hall not be your purcha&s;er." "Pray Sir," &s;ays the nephew, "now your heat's over, what is you meaning for all this? I am perfectly amazed at the oddne&s;s of your fancy." "Hold your tongue, boy," cries old cru&s;ty, "and &s;it down to thy bottle and thy pipe; when thou ha&s;t that in thy bed, that I have in my head, you will rightly under&s;tand my meaning." He then proceeded to a&s;k his nephew what ready money he had at his command, who told him," About

Having thus delivered his in&s;tructions, they drank off their bottle, and &s;o parted till the time prefixed.</P>
<P>The old gentleman had not been re|turned home above half an hour, but who &s;hould &s;tep in to &s;up with him, but the buxom widow, who being very merry and jocund at table, gave to the old alderman a &s;ea&s;onable opportunity to put her in mind of matrimony, won|dering how &s;o pretty a lady, and &s;o good a fortune, could &s;pend &s;o much of her youth and beauty without the con&s;olation of a good hu&s;band; and withal began to &s;peak much in the prai&s;e of a jolly young nephew of his, who was lately come from the Ea&s;t Indies and had made &s;o pro&s;perous a voyage, that among&s;t the re&s;t of his effects, he had brought over a couple of &s;uch precious

<P>Upon this encouragement the old gen|tleman told her, "He had engaged his nephew to dine with him on that day &s;en'night, and if &s;he would be plea&s;ed to honour them with their company, he &s;hould think him&s;elf greatly obliged to her." The lady upon the aldermans reque&s;t, an&s;wered, "She &s;hould accept of his invitation."

The lady, by that time dinner was over, could not forbear &s;ignifying by her eyes her approbation of his per|&s;on: &s;o that by the old gentleman's management, and his in&s;tructions to his nephew, the matter was &s;ettled in le&s;s than a fortnight, and the wedding kept, though with &s;ome privacy, at the alder|man's own hou&s;e; where they had not bedded above two or three nights, but the bride expecting the co&s;tly pre&s;ent of tho&s;e precious &s;tones the alderman had told her of, took an opportunity one night, when &s;he was fa&s;t locked in the embraces of her bed-fellow, to a&s;k him what was become of tho&s;e delicate rich &s;tones he had brought over with him from beyond &s;ea? "My dear, replied the bridegroom, here they are at your &s;ervice; upon my word the&s;e are the individual jewels my uncle bid me thirty thou&s;and pounds for, but I would not part with them: and upon my word,

By and by they happened to overtake a huge dead ma&s;tiff floating upon the water with his &s;kin off, and his fle&s;h rendered by putrifaction, of as many colours at the rainbow. The waterman looking earne&s;tly upon the &s;tinking carrion, &s;hook his head, and &s;cratched his ears, and &s;hewed all im|aginable &s;igns of his great unea&s;ine&s;s; which the fare ob&s;erving, could do no le&s;s than take notice of, and a&s;king him, "If that dog had ever been his, that he &s;eemed &s;o much concerned at the &s;ight of him." The waterman an&s;wered him, "No, but he could wi&s;h he was his now. and that he would willingly excu&s;e him his fare, if he would be &s;o kind as to let him go back, to take him up in the &s;tern of his boat."

From thence we were con|&s;igned back to a merchant in London; and the day before we &s;ailed, we took on board an old woman, as a pa&s;&s;enger, who for many years had kept a bawdy|hou&s;e in Port-Royal, till &s;he had &s;uc|ce&s;sfully acquired by the indu&s;try of the tail, the value of 2000 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> which &s;he had changed into Spani&s;h gold, and had brought it on board with her in a &s;mall e&s;critoir, being very de&s;irous of &s;pend|ing her latter days in England, that when &s;he died might lay her bones to re&s;t in her own country, we weighed anchor, with the wind at we&s;t and by &s;outh, getting clear of the land without any difficulty; and &s;cudded merrily on till we made Cuba, the I&s;le of Pines, the Cape Florida, and &s;o entered the gulph: But before we got through, (as ill for|tune would have it) a plank happened to &s;tart, and we &s;prung a leak &s;o fa&s;t, that, notwith&s;tanding our pumps, we had four feet water in the hold in le&s;s than an hour's time, &s;o that we had no hopes left of &s;aving our&s;elves, but by

The old woman begged hard that we would take in her box of money, which, on &s;econd thoughts, we yielded to, not knowing how u&s;eful it might prove to us, if we &s;hould chance to be driven on &s;hore among&s;t the Florida In|dians. We were in all but eight hands be&s;ides the old woman, who was as pe|nitent for all her pa&s;t crimes, as an old thief going to the gallows. Thus, ex|po&s;ed to the rage of the mercile&s;s ocean, we depended wholly upon providence to protect us; rowing by turns, keeping on our right cour&s;e, by the direction of our compa&s;s, having nothing but the dread of de&s;truction before our eyes, unle&s;s by &s;ome unexpected miracle pre|vented. The remainder of the day we &s;pent in labour at our oars, till at la&s;t night drew on, having neither &s;hip nor &s;hore in &s;ight from whence to expect &s;afety; but fortune favouring us with little wind and a calm, &s;ea, we thought it nece&s;&s;ary to take &s;o &s;air an opportu|nity

<P>How many hours we continued in this &s;ilence, I cannot tell; at la&s;t one awakes, and finds it &s;o very dark, that he could neither &s;ee moon, &s;tar, &s;ky or boat; nor could he perceive the boat had any motion as was u&s;ual; with that he alarms the re&s;t, who began to rub their eyes, and endeavoured to look about them, but could not &s;o much as &s;ee their hands, "Ble&s;s me, &s;aid, I, it is

"For God's &s;ake, &s;ays the old woman, &s;et me on &s;hore, and give me my box; I care not where I am, if it be but upon dry land." "Prithee, &s;aid I, &s;trike a light that we may &s;ee who and who's together." Which was accor|dingly done, upon which we found our|&s;elves pent up in a little place, but where we could not think nor imagine.

<HEAD>The Lover's fortunate Adventure; or, the young Ones too cunning for the old Ones.</HEAD>
<P>A YOUNG Gentleman of Hackney, known by the name of '&s;quire Suck-bottle, made it his endeavour to procure a match with Sir Thomas Clo&s;epur&s;e's daughter. In a little time he made a con|siderable progre&s;s in his de&s;ign, and had
<PB N="41" REF="035716_0021_100654A1C5F11288">gained both the affections and con&s;ent of the young lady before he had pro|po&s;ed any treaty with her father, who hearing of the intrigue between Suck-bottle and his daughter, was &s;o highly enraged at his clande&s;tine proceedings, that he forewarned him from his hou&s;e, and as a more &s;ecure prevention from the match, confined his daughter clo&s;e pri&s;|oner in her own apartment. The young '&s;quire being deeply concerned at the &s;evere u&s;age of a Roman lover, went by midnight when all things were hu&s;h and &s;ilent, to Clo&s;epu&s;e's habitation where by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a friend, he rai&s;ed a ladder, and mounted him&s;elf upon the leads of the hou&s;e and knowing her lodg|ings, dropped a letter down the chimney, to give her notice he would make her a vi&s;it the next night the &s;ame way him|&s;elf; which letter in the morning the lady found with unexpre&s;&s;ible &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>According to the time prefixed, the '&s;quire, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of two tru&s;ty friends, went in order to accompli&s;h his intrigue. The engine he had prepared to &s;hoot the chimney being a rope and a ba&s;ket, by which means he was con|veyed
<PB N="42" REF="035716_0022_100654A399856AB0">&s;afely through the &s;ooty gulph, at the bottom of which the panting lady was ready to receive him in her joyful<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> arms.</P>
<P>The &s;ignal to be given when his friends &s;hould pull him up, was a jog with the rope. Such a familiarity had already pa&s;&s;ed between them, that they lo&s;t no time in court&s;hip, but prepared them&s;elves for tho&s;e joys to which they ha&s;ted with equal eagorne&s;s. They had no &s;ooner leaped into their downy oli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|&s;ium, but the braces of the ticking be|gan to celebrate the plea&s;ures of the night with their accu&s;tomary mu&s;ic, which was unhappily over heard by her lady mother in the next room, who wa|king her hu&s;band, told him, "She was &s;ure &s;omebody was got to bed to her daughter." Upon which Sir Thomas leaps up in a wonderful ha&s;te, takes the key of his daughter's chamber out of his pocket, which he would not intru&s;t with any but him&s;elf, and gropes his way to the door. The lovers having done with their fir&s;t cour&s;e, and being laid down to take a little breath, hap|pened to hear the old gentleman &s;umb|ling at the key-hole; upon which the
<PB N="43" REF="035716_0022_100654A399856AB0">daughter, through a great pre&s;ence of mind, &s;kips nimbly out of the bed, &s;ets a chair between the bed and the chim|ney, kneels down, and with abundance of &s;eeming fervency fell to prayers; and ju&s;t as her father opened the door &s;oftly, &s;he was in this part of her devo|tion; "I be&s;eech thee make me a com|fort to my father's grey hairs, encrea&s;e his riches, advance him to honour, and may he live to the age of Mathu&s;alem." The old dad was &s;o highly plea&s;ed with his daughter's piety and kind &s;upplica|tions for her aged father, that he took no notice, and would by no means di&s;|turb her, but gently &s;hut the door and returned to his bedfellow, giving her a &s;harp reproof for her evil opinion of their dutiful and godly child.</P>
<P>Having by this &s;tratagem prevented a di&s;covery, the lovers renewed their joys, the old lady her jealou&s;y, who aro&s;e, took the key, and would go her|&s;elf to be &s;atisfied: who entered the chamber with &s;uch &s;ilence, that the bu&s;y lovers heard her not till &s;he &s;tumbled at the chair, and by lucky accident fell into the ba&s;ket, which jogged the rope, and gave the &s;ignal.

An arch unlucky blade who was &s;on to a neighbouring brewer, u&s;ing to take delight in je&s;ting with the female &s;ex, pretended to court her, and made her believe he de&s;igned to make her his wife; carrying on the matter to &s;o great a height, that the morning was appointed on which they were to be married at St. Pancras church, he promi&s;ing to meet her at a certain hour in the church-yard, and to bring the ring and a licence along with him, the whole proceeding being without the knowledge of the father.</P>

The gentleman had not long con|tinued his court&s;hip, but he found &s;uffi|cient rea&s;ons to &s;u&s;pect that he had not only worked him&s;elf into the widows love, but al&s;o into the affections of the daughter; and began to con&s;ider, that the old wo|man was much the better fortune, yet the daughter would prove the more agree|able match, and that what &s;he wanted in fortune would be &s;upplied more to his &s;atisfaction by her youth and beauty be|&s;ides, knowing her to be the only child, thought &s;he mu&s;t come in at la&s;t for the effects of the mother, in ca&s;e that he could but be &s;ubtile enough to divert her from matrimony.

The younger bro|ther, who was a notable &s;harp witted Gentleman and a very, per&s;onable man, reflecting one morning in his bed, upon the foul practice of his brother to gain his ends by di&s;appointing and deceiving the old gentlewoman, began to think it could be no crime in him&s;elf to take the advantage of his brother's fallacy, and at once make his own for|tune, and do ju&s;tice the widow, with|out hindering his brother from effecting his de&s;ign upon the daughter.</P>
<P>Accordingly he re&s;olved to act a cun|ning part, and to neglect no opportunity of ingratiating him&s;elf with the mother, that when &s;he became &s;en&s;ible of his

<PB N="60" REF="035716_0031_100654B752FE8898">but away he po&s;ted in all ha&s;te, to ac|quaint the old gentlewoman, "What a di&s;honourable trick his brother had putupon her, and how undutiful her daughter had been in complying to be a partner in &s;o ba&s;e and treacherous an intrigue." The widow, who had never &s;o much as &s;u&s;pected the integrity of her gallant, was &s;o amazed and &s;o confu&s;ed at the &s;trange tidings, that for a little time &s;he was as &s;tark mad as a raving bed lamite, till her pa&s;&s;ion was pretty well &s;pent, and then the young gentleman, to &s;pur on her revenge, told her, "That his brother's further de&s;ign was to divert her if po&s;&s;ible, from ma|trimony in hopes that her own fortune, upon her death, might de&s;cend to her daughter, &s;o that he &s;hould become at la&s;t ma&s;ter of all her riches, as well as the fortune already &s;ettled upon her daughter, and that this was the main con&s;ideration that induced him to mar|ry her daughter after &s;o many preten|tions to her&s;elf." This &s;ubtle in&s;inuation &s;o inflamed her malice, that &s;he vowed, rather than they &s;hould be one &s;hilling the better for what &s;he had, &s;he would marry a cobler, or any rake hall, that
<PB N="61" REF="035716_0031_100654B752FE8898">&s;he was &s;ure would &s;pend it every groat." To which replied the young gen|tleman, "Madam, a per&s;on of your worth, comeline&s;s and di&s;cretion, can never have occa&s;ion to di&s;po&s;e of your|&s;elf to either a mean man or a &s;pend thrift, could you conceive me to be a per&s;on worthy of &s;o great a happine&s;s as &s;o good a wife, I &s;hould think it a ble&s;&s;ing to my&s;elf and family, that you would give it into my power, to re|pair the injury and di&s;honour which my brother has done you; and I a&s;&s;ure you further, madam, that if you make me your hu&s;band, it will prove a revenge upon him, a ble&s;&s;ing to me and I promi&s;e you, I will do ail that in an hone&s;t gen|tleman lies to make it a happine&s;s to your&s;elf." "Well &s;ays the old gentle|woman, le&s;t time and delay &s;hould make you prove as great a knave as your bro|ther I will &s;eek out for no other hu&s;band nor need any further court&s;hip; but in the revengeful mood I am now in, I will run this minute, headlong to be married."</P>
<P>The young gentleman expre&s;&s;ed his ut|mo&s;t joy for her &s;udden re&s;olution, &s;o im|mediately ordered a coach to be called
<PB N="62" REF="035716_0032_100654BA34DC4D88">and away they went fir&s;t to make out a licence, and then to be married the very &s;ame morning, and at the &s;ame church, and by the &s;ame mini&s;ter who had joined the former couple. As &s;oon as the cere|mony was over, the young bridegroom, by the con&s;ent of his bride, ordered the coachman to drive to the &s;ame tavern where the treacherous pair had provided their wedding dinner, and in they popped upon them ju&s;t as the fir&s;t di&s;h was brought upon the table; the daughter was ready to faint thro' fear, the bridegroom bit his nails through madne&s;s; the mother up|braided the quondum lover with ba&s;e|ne&s;s, her daughter with undutifulne&s;s; the elder brother taxed the younger with treachery, whil&s;t the greate&s;t win|ner &s;miled in his &s;leeve, to think that at one lucky hit he had made his for|tune.</P>
<P>When their pa&s;&s;ions, as well as their victuals, were grown pretty cool, the younge&s;t bridgroom, who was a man of eloquence, made a plea&s;ant &s;peech that unriddled the whole my&s;tery, and went &s;o far in the reconciliation of all differences, that they &s;at down to
<PB N="63" REF="035716_0032_100654BA34DC4D88">victuals, and made one dinner &s;erve for both weddings: The elder brother at la&s;t &s;ubmitting to call the younger father, and the mother acknowledged the elder to be her &s;on. So that by the help of mirth and wine they became all friends: and each lived comfortably for the future, with their own proper mates: and in proce&s;s of time hammered out &s;uch a promi&s;cuous progeny that would puzzle the herald's office properly to di&s;tingui&s;h what relation they were to one another.</P>

<HEAD>The dying wife's revenge; or, The hu&s;|band paid in his own coin.</HEAD>
<P>A FARMER's wife falling danger|ou&s;ly ill, was very importunate with her hu&s;band, that he would grant her the liberty of making a will to di&s;po&s;e of her wearing apparrel. The good man, that his wife might go out of the world with a &s;afe con&s;cience, &s;eem|ed very willing to comply with her re|que&s;t; and that &s;he might be &s;ure every thing &s;hould be bequeathed according to her own directions.

Away went the good man, at his wife's re|que&s;t, to mu&s;ter up the materials; but before he returned had the wit to con|&s;ider it was a hard ca&s;e, that her clothes, which were very neat and good, &s;hould be given to a parcel of go&s;&s;ips, away from her own children; and withal formed a project, as he thought, &s;o to deceive his wife, that &s;he might die in peace, and yet &s;ave her apparel from the thankle&s;s hands of a parcel of tip|pling tittle tattles. When he had thus prepared him&s;elf, he returns with the &s;cribbling in&s;truments to his wife's bed &s;ide, de&s;iring her freely to impart her mind, promi&s;ing that all things &s;hould be perfor med accordingly; upon which &s;he began her in&s;tructions after the following manner, <HI>viz.</HI> "In the fir&s;t place, give unto my beloved friend and neighbour, goody Blowzen, my high crowned hat, and be&s;t red petticoat,

The good man writes, <HI>Tittle tattle for that;</HI> and then defires the next item," La&s;tly, &s;ays &s;he, I give and bequeath my great cla&s;ped Bible, and my Whole Duty of Man to my dame Camwell, for &s;he is a religious woman, of whom I have learned more good over a jug of &s;trong beer, than ever I did of the par&s;on, for all the tithes we have given him; and that is all, I de&s;ire to di&s;po&s;e of from you. "Very well," replies the good man, and again, in&s;tead of the la&s;t item, &s;ets down a <HI>Tittle tattle for that.</HI> Well, wife, &s;ays he, now all things are or|dered according to your mind, I hope, you will die &s;atisfied."

The good man, according to his wife's direction, left the paper in the window; and after he had given her a comfortable word or two, away he went about his bu&s;ine&s;s. No &s;ooner was his back turned, but in came one of her go&s;&s;iping legatees, to pay her a vi&s;it; who entering the chamber, thus acco&s;ted the &s;ick woman, <HI>viz.</HI> "How d'ye now, Neighbour? I hope, by the grace of God, you find your&s;elf on the mending hand." "No, truly.

So the go&s;&s;ip &s;hed a tear or two at parting, and, according to the others reque&s;t, took her leave for the pre&s;ent.

<P>A Jolly Cri&s;pin having a confounded &s;cold to his wife, happened to come home one night, at a late hour very much troubled with a drunken vertigo in his noddle. He had no &s;ooner enter|ed the &s;hop, but his angry help-mate, in a mighty pa&s;&s;ion for his offence, be|gan to &s;pit out &s;uch provoking me&s;&s;es of maundering broth, in the very teeth of her pot valiant &s;pou&s;e, that he &s;wore,

She &s;till per&s;i&s;ted in her termagent &s;pirit, and very ag|gravating words were to&s;&s;ed backwards and forwards, till at la&s;t the difference grew too great for any pre&s;ent recon|ciliation. A chimney &s;weeper coming by, who had pawned his brooms for an evenings draught, over-hearing their cour&s;e compliments, &s;tood a little under the eves to li&s;ten to the fray. The &s;hoe-maker at la&s;t grew &s;o highly en|raged, that he &s;wore he would go out again: and wrenched open the door in &s;pite of his wife's re&s;i&s;tance, out he went, and away he &s;taggered, &s;he baw|ling after him in the&s;e words viz. "Go, and be hang'd, you rogue, &s;ince you will go, and may the devil go with you." The chimney &s;weeper, when he heard the door open &s;kuttled away a little before the &s;hoe-maker, and &s;tepped up into an alley till Cri&s;pin was gone pa&s;t him; then flinging his &s;ooty &s;ack which he had upon his &s;houlder over his head like a hood that he might make the more unu&s;ual figure, he
<PB N="71" REF="035716_0036_100654C3AA35B5B8">trudged after the &s;hoe-maker, till he got ju&s;t upon the heels of him. Cri&s;pin hearing &s;omebody come ratteling after, faced about, and by the light of the &s;tars di&s;covered a &s;trange black mon&s;ter ju&s;t at his very no&s;e. "Who are you?" &s;ays the &s;hoe-maker. "The devil. cries the chimney &s;weeper, "Pray, Mr. De|vil, &s;ays Cri&s;pin, what want you with me?" "Your wife &s;ent me after you, cries the chimney &s;weeper, to fetch you home?" "Home, cries Cri&s;pin, Pray Mr. Devil, to which home; your home or my home?" To your home an&s;wers the chimney &s;weeper. "Then by all the &s;hoes in my &s;hop &s;ays Cri&s;pin, I will not go, except you will fir&s;t carry my wife to your home, and then I'll go home pre&s;ently." "Done &s;ays the chimney &s;weeper, &s;tay you here till I return, and I'll pack her off for you in&s;tantly." "Done cries the &s;hoe-maker, do you perform your work, and I'll perform my word." Away runs the chimney &s;weeper to the &s;hoe-maker's hou&s;e in St. Mar|tins, knocks at the door, to which comes the wife in her &s;mock, expecting it was her hu&s;band: The chimney &s;weeper, for fear of frightning her, pre|&s;ently
<PB N="72" REF="035716_0037_10063C068F5B6580">di&s;covers him&s;elf, and tells her what a trick he had put upon her hu&s;band, and upon what errand her &s;pou&s;e had &s;ent him; and that if &s;he would but fir&s;t let him make him a cuckold, he would engage to make him a good hu&s;band forever after. Upon this condition the wife con&s;ented; and the bu&s;ine&s;s being done with a jirk, he gave her directions how &s;he &s;hould ma|nage the matter, and returned again to &s;hoemaker, who waited with great impatience to hear the &s;ucce&s;s. "Well, &s;ays Cri&s;pin to the devil, as he thought, have you done the bu&s;ine&s;s?" "Ay, ay, &s;ays the chimney &s;weeper, effectually, therefore make ha&s;te home, for I forgot to &s;hut the door after me." How did &s;he behave her&s;elf? &s;ays Cri&s;pin, did &s;he not &s;cold damnably?" "Confoundedly, cries the chimney &s;weeper; &s;he has already put hell in an uproar, and how long we &s;hall be able to keep her there the Lord knows." "Wounds, &s;ays the &s;hoe-ma|ker, good devil, keep her now thou ha&s;t her, for if you let her come back again, I will certainly hang my&s;elf."

<P>Upon the&s;e words out bolts his wife upon him from the clo&s;et, with her hair about her ears like a fury and her &s;mock as black with the chimney &s;weepers &s;muggling her, as if her&s;elf had been the devil crying out "You lie, you rogue, I defy the devil and all his works, I will make you know, Sirrah, there is never a devilin hell can ma&s;ter me, I am &s;et on it; you may &s;ee by

<P>ONE of the judges in king Charles the &s;econd's reign, being in the long va|cation at his country hou&s;e in Hol&s;worth in Suffolk happened upon too &s;erious re|flection on &s;ome little juvenal mi&s;carriages to fall into a deep fit of the hypocondria in&s;omuch that he fancied him&s;elf to be
