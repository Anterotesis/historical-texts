<HEAD>TO THE <HI>CITIZENS</HI> OF THE UNITED STATES:</HEAD>
<P>WHILE candid and informed hi&s;torians and other writers in the chri&s;tian church, confe&s;s and lament the &s;pirit of intolerance which has frequently degraded their religion, it is hoped that the follow|ing invaluable extracts from the works of that excellent man, Thomas Jeffer&s;on, the pre&s;ent Vice Pre&s;ident of the United States, will be an accept|able tribute of re&s;pect for true religion, correct animo&s;ities among &s;ectarians, and extend univer&s;al peace and confidence through our country.</P>
<P>This publication, appeared to be more needful at this time, when the profe&s;&s;ors of chri&s;tianity in the United States, lament that fa&s;ts, prayers and &s;ermons, have been perverted to the purpo&s;es of war, and the animo&s;ities of party.</P>
<P>The truly religious man, impre&s;&s;ed with due reverence for the author of his exi&s;tence and con&s;tant pre&s;erver, invariably obtains re&s;pect, dignity and u&s;efulne&s;s, by avoiding the overtures of hypocri&s;y, and &s;pecious pretexts of piety.</P>
<P><PB N="ii" REF="037706_0003_100F4154F440CCF0">
A&s;&s;uming no dominion over the faith of others, he re&s;pectfully re&s;igns the rites of religion and acts of piety to the acceptance of all men, according to the light they have received, and the dictates of their own con&s;ciences.</P>
<P>To put an end to per&s;ecutions, jealou&s;ies, rancors and delu&s;ions, re&s;ulting from the union of church and &s;tate, by political e&s;tabli&s;hments, has been the aim of tho&s;e who &s;ecured independence and law for us, as a nation, with the aid of our own valour and wi&s;dom.</P>
<P>Upon the pre&s;ervation of the&s;e &s;acred and ine&s;|timable rights, depends a large proportion of our felicity and pro&s;perity at all times.</P>

<HEAD>THE <HI>DIFFERENT RELIGIONS</HI> RECEIVED INTO THE STATE OF <HI>VIRGINIA.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE fir&s;t &s;ettlers in this country were emi|grants from England, of the Engli&s;h church, ju&s;t at a point of time when it was flu&s;hed with com|plete victory over the religious of all per&s;ua&s;ions. Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, as they became, of the powers of making admini&s;tering, and executing the laws, they &s;hew|ed equal intolerance in this country with their Pre&s;byterian brethren, who had emigrated to the northern government. The poor Quakers were flying from per&s;ecution in England. They ca&s;t their eyes on the&s;e new countries as a&s;ylums of civil and religious freedom; but they found them free only for the reigning &s;ect. Several acts of the Virginia a&s;&s;embly of 1659, 1662 and 1693.
<PB N="2" REF="037706_0005_100F415780043238">bad made it penal in parents to refu&s;e to have their children baptized; had prohibited the un|lawful a&s;&s;embling of Quakers; had made it penal for any ma&s;ter of a ve&s;&s;el to bring a Quaker into the &s;tate; had ordered tho&s;e already here, and &s;uch as &s;hould come thereafter, to be impri&s;oned till they &s;hould abjure the country: provided a milder puni&s;hment for their fir&s;t and &s;econd re|turn, but death for their third; had inhibited all per&s;ons from &s;uffering their meetings in or near their hou&s;es, entertaining them individually, or di&s;po&s;ing of books which &s;upported their tenets. If no execution took place here, as did in New-England, it was not owing to the moderation of the church, or &s;pirit of the legi&s;lature, as may be inferred from the law it&s;elf; but to hi&s;torical cir|cum&s;tances which have not been handed down to us. The Anglicans retained full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the country about a century. Other opinions began then to creep in, and the great care of the government of &s;upport their own church, having begotten an equal degree of indolence in its cler|gy, two-thirds of the people had become di&s;&s;ent|ers at the commencement of the pre&s;ent revolu|tion. The laws indeed were &s;till oppre&s;&s;ive on them, but the &s;pirit of the one party had &s;ub&s;id|ed into moderation, and of the other had ri&s;en to a degree of determination which commanded re&s;pect.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent &s;tate of our laws on the &s;ubject of religion is this. The convention of May 1776, in their declaration of rights, declared it to be a truth, and a natural right, that the ex|erci&s;e of religion &s;hould be free; but when they proceeded to form on that declaration the ordi|nance of government, in&s;tead of taking up every principle declared in the bill of rights, and guard|ing
<PB N="3" REF="037706_0006_100F4170DFD1FB18">it by legi&s;lative &s;anction, they pa&s;&s;ed over that which a&s;&s;erted our religious rights, leaving them as they found them. The &s;ame convention, however, when they met as a member of the ge|neral a&s;&s;embly in October, 1776, repealed all <HI>acts of parliament</HI> which had rendered criminal the maintaining any opinions in matters of reli|gion, the forbearing to repair to church, and the exerci&s;ing any mode of wor&s;hip; and &s;u&s;pended the laws giving &s;alaries to the clergy, which &s;u&s;|pen&s;ion was made perpetual in October 1779. Statutory oppre&s;&s;ions in religion being thus wip|ed away, we remain at pre&s;ent under tho&s;e only impo&s;ed by the common law; or by our own acts of a&s;&s;embly. At the common law, <HI>heresy</HI> was a capital offence, puni&s;hable by burning. Its de|finition was left to the eccle&s;ia&s;tical judges, before whom the conviction was, till the &s;tatute of the 1 El. c. 1. circum&s;cribed it, by declaring, that nothing &s;hould be deemed here&s;y, but what had been &s;o determined by authority of the canoni|cal &s;criptures, or by one of the four fir&s;t gene|ral councils, or by &s;ome other council having for the grounds of their declaration the expre&s;s and plain words of the &s;criptures. Here&s;y, thus cir|cum&s;cribed, being an offence at the common law, our act of a&s;&s;embly of October, 1777, c. 17. gives cognizance of it to the general court, by declaring that the juri&s;diction of that court &s;hall be general in all matters at the common law. The execution is by the writ <HI>De hoeretico comburendo.</HI> By our own act of a&s;&s;embly of 1705, c. 30. if a per&s;on brought up in the Chri&s;tian religion denies the being of a God, or the Trinity, or a&s;&s;erts there are more gods than one, or denies the Chri&s;tian re|ligion to be true, or the &s;criptures to be of divine authority, he is puni&s;hable on the fir&s;t offence by in|capacity
<PB N="4" REF="037706_0007_100F415A694CEBF8">to hold any office or employment eccle&s;ia&s;|tical, civil, or military; on the &s;econd by di&s;|ability to &s;ue, to take any gift or legacy, to be guardian, executor, or admini&s;trator, and by three years impri&s;onment without bail. A father's right to the cu&s;tody of his own children being founded in law on his right of guardian&s;hip, this being tak|en away, they may of cour&s;e be &s;evered from him, and put by the authority of a court, into more orthodox hands. This is a &s;ummary view of that religious &s;lavery, under which a people have been willing to remain, who have lavi&s;hed their lives and fortunes for the e&s;tabli&s;hment of their civil freedom.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Furneaux pa&s;&s;im.</NOTE> The error &s;eems not &s;uf|ficiently eradicated, that the operations of the mind, as well as the acts of the body, are &s;ubject to the coercion of the laws. But our rulers can have no authority over &s;uch natural rights only as we have &s;ubmitted to them. The rights of con&s;cience we never &s;ubmitted, we could not &s;ubmit. We are an&s;werable for them to our God. The legitimate powers of government extend to &s;uch acts only as are injurious to others. But it does me no injury for my neighbour to &s;ay there are twenty gods, or no god. It neither picks my pocket nor breaks my leg. If it be &s;aid, his te&s;timony in a court of ju&s;tice cannot be relied on, reject it then, and be the &s;tigma on him. Con|&s;traint may make him wor&s;e by making him a hypo|crite, but it will never make him a truer man. It may fix him ob&s;tinately in his errors, and will not cure them. Rea&s;on and free inquiry are the only effectual agents again&s;t error. Give a loo&s;e to them, they will &s;upport the true religion, by bring|ing
<PB N="5" REF="037706_0008_100F41735FF68A78">every fal&s;e one to their tribunal, to the te&s;t of their inve&s;tigation. They are the natural enemies of error, and of error only. Had not the Roman government permitted free inquiry, Chri&s;tianity could never have been introduced. Had not free inquiry been indulged at the aera of the reformation, the corruptions of Chri&s;tianity could not have been purged away. If it be re&s;trained now, the pre&s;ent corruptions will be protected and new ones en|couraged. Was the government to pre&s;cribe to us our medicine and diet, our bodies would be in &s;uch keeping as our &s;ouls are now. Thus in France the emetic was once forbidden as a medicine, and the potato as an article of food. Government is ju&s;t as infallible too when it fixes &s;y&s;tems in phy&s;ics. Galileo was &s;ent to the inqui&s;ition for affirming that the earth was a &s;phere: the government had declared it to be as flat as a trencher, and Galileo was obliged to abjure his error. This error how|ever at length prevailed, the earth became a globe, and De&s;cartes declared it was whirled round its axis by a vortex. The government in which he lived was wi&s;e enough to &s;ee that this was no que&s;tion of civil juri&s;diction, or we &s;hould all have been involved by authority in vortices. In fact, the vortices have been exploded, and the Newtonian principle of gravitation is now more firmly e&s;tab|li&s;hed, on the ba&s;is of rea&s;on, than it would be were the government to &s;tep in, and to make it an article of nece&s;&s;ary faith. Rea&s;on and experiment have been indulged, and error has fled before them. It is error alone which needs the &s;upport of govern|ment. Truth can &s;tand by it&s;elf. Subject opinion to coercion: whom will you make your inqui&s;itors? Fallible men; men governed by bad pa&s;&s;ions, by private as well as public rea&s;ons. And why &s;ubject it to coercion? To produce uniformity. But is unifor|mity
<PB N="6" REF="037706_0009_100F417A612A7A80">of opinion de&s;irable? No more than of face and &s;tature. Introduce the bed of Procru&s;tes then, and as there is danger that the large men may beat the &s;mall, make us all of a &s;ize, by lopping the former and &s;tretching the latter. Difference of opinion is advantageous in religion. The &s;everal &s;ects perform the office of a cen&s;or morum over each other. Is uniformity attainable? Millions of innocent men, woman, and children, &s;ince the introduction of Chri&s;tianity, have been burnt, tortured, fined, impri&s;oned; yet we have not ad|vanced one inch towards uniformity. What has been the effect of coercion? to make one half the world fools, and the other half hypocrites. To &s;upport roguery and error all over the earth. Let us reflect that it is inhabited by a thou&s;and millions of people. That the&s;e profe&s;s probably a thou&s;and different &s;y&s;tems of religion. That ours is but one of that thou&s;and. That if there be but one right, and ours that one, we &s;hould wi&s;h to &s;ee the 999 wandering &s;ects gathered into the fold of truth. But again&s;t &s;uch a majority we cannot effect this by force. Rea&s;on and per&s;ua&s;ion are the only prac|ticable in&s;truments. To make way for the&s;e, free inquiry mu&s;t be indulged; and how can we wi&s;h others to indulge it while we refu&s;e it our&s;elves. But every &s;tate, &s;ays an inqui&s;itor, has e&s;tabli&s;hed &s;ome religion. No two, &s;ay I, have e&s;tabli&s;hed the &s;ame. Is this a proof of the infallibility of e&s;tabli&s;hments? Our &s;i&s;ter &s;tates of Penn&s;ylvania and New-York, however, have long &s;ub&s;i&s;ted with|out any e&s;tabli&s;hment at all. The experiment was new and doubtful when they made it. It has an&s;wered beyond conception. They flouri&s;h infinitely. Religion is well &s;upported; of vari|ous kinds, indeed, but all good enough; all &s;uf|ficient to pre&s;erve peace and order: or if a &s;ect
<PB N="7" REF="037706_0010_100F4174EDE2BFF8">ari&s;es, who&s;e tenets would &s;ubvert morals, good &s;en&s;e has fair play, and rea&s;ons and laughs it out of doors, without &s;uffering the &s;tate to be troubled with it. They do not hang more malefactors than we do. They are not more di&s;turbed with religious di&s;&s;en&s;ions. On the contrary, their harmony is unparalled, and can be a&s;cribed to nothing but their unbounded tolerance, becau&s;e there is no other circum&s;tance in which they differ from every nation on earth. They have made the happy di&s;covery, that the way to &s;ilence religious di&s;putes, is to take no notice of them. Let us too give this experiment fair play, and get rid, while we may, of tho&s;e ty|rannical laws. It is true, we are as yet &s;ecured again&s;t them by the &s;pirit of the times. I doubt whether the people of this country would &s;uffer an execution for here&s;y, or a three years impri&s;on|ment for not comprehending the my&s;teries of the Trinity. But is the &s;pirit of the people an infal|lible, a permanent reliance? Is it government? Is this the kind of protection we receive in return for the rights we give up? Be&s;ides, the &s;pirit of the times may alter, will alter. Our rulers will become corrupt, our people carele&s;s. A &s;ingle zealot may commence per&s;ecutor, and better men be his victims. It can never be too often repeated that the time for fixing every e&s;&s;ential right on a legal ba&s;is is while our rulers are hone&s;t, and our|&s;elves united. From the conclu&s;ion of this war we &s;hall be going down hill. It will not then be nece&s;&s;ary to re&s;ort every moment to the people for &s;upport. They will be forgotten, therefore, and their rights di&s;regarded. They will forget them|&s;elves, but in the &s;ole faculty of making money, and will never think of uniting of effect a due re&s;|pect for rights. The &s;hackles, therefore, which &s;hall not be knocked off at the conclu&s;ion of this
<PB N="8" REF="037706_0011_100F417CB95959C8">war, will remain on us long, will be made heavier and heavier, till our rights &s;hall revive or expire in a convul&s;ion.</P>

<DIV1 TYPE="Act of the Virginia Assembly">
<HEAD>An <HI>ACT</HI> for establishing <HI>RELIGIOUS FREEDOM,</HI> passed in the Assembly of Virginia, in the be|gining of the year <HI>1786.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WELL aware that Almighty God hath crea|ted the mind free; that all attempts to influence it by temporal puni&s;hments or burdens, or by civil incapacitations, tend only to beget habits of hypo|cri&s;y and meanne&s;s, and are a departure from the plan of the Holy Author of our religion, who be|ing Lord both of body and mind, yet cho&s;e not to propogate it by coercions on either, as was in his Almighty power to do; that the impious pre&s;ump|tion of legi&s;lators and rulers, civil as well as eccle|&s;ia&s;tical, who, being them&s;elves but fallible an un|in&s;pired men have a&s;&s;umed dominion over the faith of others, &s;etting up their own opinions and modes of thinking as the only true and infallible, and as &s;uch endeavouring to impo&s;e them on others, hath e&s;tabli&s;hed and maintained fal&s;e religions over the greate&s;t part of the world, and through all time; that to compel a man to furni&s;h contributions of money for the propogation of opinions which he di&s;believes, is &s;inful and tyrannical; that even the forcing him to &s;upport this or that teacher of his
<PB N="9" REF="037706_0012_100F4177DD8B85B8">own religious per&s;ua&s;ion, is depriving him of the comfortable liberty of giving his contributions to the particular pa&s;tor who&s;e morals he would make his pattern, and who&s;e powers he &s;eels mo&s;t per|&s;ua&s;ive to righteou&s;ne&s;s, and is withdrawing from the mini&s;try tho&s;e temporal rewards, which, pro|ceeding from an approbation of their per&s;onal con|duct, are an additional incitement to earne&s;t and unremitting labours for the in&s;truction of mankind; that our civil rights have no dependance on our re|ligious opinions, more than our opinions in phy&s;ics or geometry; that therefore the pro&s;cribing any citizen as unworthy the public confidence by laying upon him an incapacity of being called to offices of tru&s;t and emolument, unle&s;s he profe&s;s or renounce this or that religious opinion, is depriving him in|juriou&s;ly of tho&s;e privileges and advantages to which in common with his fellow-citizens he has a natural right; that it tends al&s;o to corrupt the prin|ciples of that very religion it is meant to encourage, by bribing, with a monopoly of worldly honours and emoluments, tho&s;e who will externally profe&s;s and conform to it; and though indeed the&s;e are criminal who do not with&s;tand &s;uch temptation, yet neither are tho&s;e innocent who lay the bait in their way; that to &s;uffer the civil magi&s;trate to in|trude his powers into the field of opinion and to re&s;train the profe&s;&s;ion or propogation of principles, on &s;uppo&s;ition of their ill tendency, is a dangerous fallacy, which at once de&s;troys all religious liberty becau&s;e he being of cour&s;e judge of that tendency, will make his opinions the rule of judgment, and approve or condemn the sentiments of others only as they &s;hall &s;quare with or differ from his own; that it is time enough for the rightful purpo&s;es of civil government, for its officers to interfere when principles break out into overt acts again&s;t peace
<PB N="10" REF="037706_0013_100F417F5F2115F0">and good order; and finally, that truth is great and will prevail if left to her&s;elf, that &s;he is the proper and &s;ufficient antagoni&s;t to error, and has nothing to fear from the conflict, unle&s;s by human interpo&s;ition di&s;armed of her natural weapons, free argument and debate, errors cea&s;ing to be danger|ous when it is permitted freely to contradict them.</P>
<P><HI>Be it therefore enacted by the General Assembly,</HI> That no man &s;hall be compelled to frequent or &s;up|port any religious wor&s;hip, place or mini&s;try what|&s;oever, nor &s;hall be enforced; re&s;trained, mo|le&s;ted, or burthened in his body or goods, nor &s;hall otherwi&s;e &s;uffer on account of his religious opinions or belief; but that all men &s;hall be free to profe&s;s, and by argument to maintain, their opinions in matters of religion and that the &s;ame &s;hall in no wi&s;e dimini&s;h, enlarge, or affect their civil capacities.</P>
<P>And though we well know that this a&s;&s;embly, elected by the people for the ordinary purpo&s;es of legi&s;lation only, have no power to re&s;train the acts of &s;ucceeding A&s;&s;emblies, con&s;tituted with powers equal to our own, and that therefore to declare this act irrevocable, would he of no effect in law, yet we are free to declare, and do declare, that the rights hereby a&s;&s;erted are of the natural rights of mankind, and that if any act &s;hall be hereafter pa&s;&s;ed to repeal the pre&s;ent or to narrow its operation, &s;uch act will be an infringement of natural right.</P>
