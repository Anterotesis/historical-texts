<ARGUMENT>
<P>THE following Amendment to the Bill providing the Means of Intercour&s;e between the United States and Foreign Nations, being under con&s;ideration, to wit, In the Section which provides that <Q>the Pre&s;ident &s;hall not allow to any Mini&s;ter <HI>Plenipotentiary</HI> a greater &s;um than at the rate of nine thou&s;and dollars per annum, as a compen&s;ation for all his per&s;onal &s;ervices and other expen&s;es; nor a greater &s;um for the &s;ame than four thou&s;and five hundred dollars per annum, to <HI>a Charg&eacute; des Affaires;</HI></Q> &s;trike out the word <HI>"Plenipotentiary,"</HI> and in&s;ert in lieu thereof the words "to Great-Britain, France or Spain;" &s;trike out the words <HI>"Charg&eacute; des Affaires,"</HI> and in&s;ert in lieu thereof the words "any Mini&s;ter to any other foreign nation:"</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<HEAD><HI>MR. HARPER</HI> DELIVERED THE FOLLOWING SPEECH.</HEAD>
<P>IT was my wi&s;h, and my hope, Mr. Chairman, when this bu&s;ine&s;s was again called up &s;ome days ago, after an intermi&s;|&s;ion of three weeks or more, that we &s;hould at length be per|mitted to come to a deci&s;ion without further debate, on a que&s;tion which had &s;o long occupied the attention of the Hou&s;e, and already, perhaps, exhau&s;ted the patience of the public. I and tho&s;e with whom I think on this occa&s;ion, were willing, for the &s;ake of an early deci&s;ion, to pa&s;s by, unan&s;wered, many things which, though &s;u&s;ceptible, in our opinion, of an ea&s;y refutation, were calculated to make an impre&s;&s;ion to our di&s;advantage. We were even content to leave unnoticed the violent philippic of the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Nicholas) who introduced this motion, and who, in &s;upport of it, has allowed him&s;elf &s;o great a latitude of invective again&s;t its oppo&s;ers and their adherents. We therefore repeatedly called for the que&s;tion, and did all in our power to clo&s;e a debate in which &s;uch immoderate u&s;e had already been made of the indulgence of the Hou&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="033839_0003_0FF9640A90EECEF0">
But it did not &s;o &s;eem good to the gentleman from Penn&s;ylvania (Mr. Gallatin). He ye&s;terday pronounced a di&s;cour&s;e of three hours and an half long, in which he repeated a&s;&s;ertions formerly refuted, and made them the ground of a long train of rea&s;oning; and ad|vanced many new po&s;itions equally untenable, but equally capable, if left undetected and unexpo&s;ed, of mi&s;leading the mind. The&s;e a&s;&s;ertions, which the gentleman from Penn&s;ylvania has not attempted to prove, though they are the ground-works of all his rea&s;onings, were advanced with a boldne&s;s which nothing but a belief that he was to remain unan&s;wered, could have produced. His &s;peech, when prepared in his clo&s;et, was evidently intended for a concluding &s;peech; and hence he has laid down po&s;itions which he knew to be unfounded, with a boldne&s;s whereof even he him&s;elf has heretofore exhibited no example. On the&s;e po&s;itions, he has built a gigantic &s;tructure of argument to &s;upport the pre&s;ent motion; a &s;tructure which, like a va&s;t edifice re&s;ting on loo&s;e blocks, mu&s;t fall and crumble in the du&s;t, as &s;oon as &s;ome per&s;on &s;hall take the trouble to di&s;cover and knock away its frail and temporary props.</P>
<P>It is for this purpo&s;e, that I now ri&s;e once more to tre&s;pa&s;s on the indulgence of the committee. The loo&s;e blocks which &s;upport this edifice I mean to knock away; an operation which requires neither &s;trength nor &s;kill, which may be performed by any per&s;on who &s;tands near enough to di&s;cover the defect; and then it will be &s;een with what &s;peedy ruin a &s;tructure &s;o large, and appearing &s;o &s;olid, when viewed from a di&s;tance, will tumble to the earth.</P>
<P>Though called up, however, Mr. Chairman, by the a&s;&s;ertions of the gentleman from Penn&s;ylvania, I &s;hall not confine my&s;elf wholly to them, but &s;hall incidentally notice &s;uch ob&s;ervations of other gentlemen as may appear reducible to any head of argument. There are &s;ome parts of the la&s;t &s;peech of the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Nicholas) on which, though they appear to have no nece&s;&s;ary con|nection with the &s;ubject, I cannot omit to make &s;ome animadver|&s;ions. Tho&s;e I &s;hall, in the fir&s;t place, &s;ubmit to the committee, and then proceed to other and more important parts of the di&s;|cu&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>The gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Nicholas) perhaps fore&s;eeing that ample retribution of prai&s;e which he has &s;ince received, em|ployed a con&s;iderable part of his la&s;t &s;peech in a mo&s;t pompous pa|negyric on his friend from Penn&s;ylvania (Mr. Gallatin). Had he &s;topt here, Mr. Chairman; had he contented him&s;elf with extolling the virtues and talents of his friend and political a&s;&s;ociate, even at the expen&s;e of every body el&s;e, I &s;hould have been di&s;po&s;ed to pa&s;s it by unnoticed. The gentleman from Virginia, no doubt, enter|tains this exalted opinion of his friend from Penn&s;ylvania, and I &s;hould never deny him the right, or grudge him the plea&s;ure of ex|pre&s;&s;ing it; nor have I any di&s;po&s;ition to detract from the merit of the gentleman from Penn&s;ylvania, or dimini&s;h the reputation which he may be &s;uppo&s;ed to po&s;&s;e&s;s. But the gentleman from Virginia did not &s;top here. Not content with extolling his friend above all that is great and di&s;tingui&s;hed in the country, he went on to impute the wor&s;t of motives, the mo&s;t ba&s;e and contemptible pa&s;&s;ions, to
<PB N="5" REF="033839_0004_0FF96430F7FC4680">tho&s;e who do not partake in his enthu&s;ia&s;tic admiration. He told us that frequent attacks were made, in this Hou&s;e, on the gentleman from Penn&s;ylvania, and that tho&s;e attacks proceeded from envy of his &s;uperior talents, were a tacit acknowledgment of that pre|eminence of ability, which every day's debate rendered more and more con&s;picuous.</P>
<P>Mr. Chairman, I might, I know, be excu&s;ed from taking any part of this ob&s;ervation to my&s;elf per&s;onally; for it will be remem|bered that I have made none of tho&s;e attacks which are &s;poken of on the gentleman from Penn&s;ylvania. Perhaps this has been becau&s;e I have, for my part, never felt that &s;uperiority, never perceived that pre-eminence, from which the attacks are &s;uppo&s;ed to proceed. That the gentleman from Penn&s;ylvania has merit no body will deny, and no body can be le&s;s di&s;po&s;ed to deny it than me; but I confe&s;s that I have never ob&s;erved that &s;uperiority over many other members of this Hou&s;e, much le&s;s over all, whereby the gentleman from Vir|ginia has been &s;o much dazzled. And I would remind that gentle|man, that all greatne&s;s is by compari&s;on, and that the compari&s;on, in ca&s;es of this kind, is generally made, not between a man and his antagoni&s;ts, but between him and his a&s;&s;ociates. Even a ru&s;h-light may &s;eem a re&s;plendent luminary, when compared to a glow-worm; and in a dark room, the &s;malle&s;t &s;park becomes bright and di&s;tin|gui&s;hed. I would &s;ubmit it to the gentleman from Virginia, whe|ther he has not committed &s;ome mi&s;take of this kind. Amid&s;t the thick gloom that is ob&s;erved to re&s;t on a certain de&s;cription of per|&s;ons, a certain cla&s;s of political opinion, in this country, I will not &s;ay in this Hou&s;e, is it to be wondered at, if the glimmerings of &s;en&s;e and capacity which are &s;ometimes emitted from that quarter by the gentleman from Penn&s;ylvania, &s;hould dazzle the eyes of his a&s;&s;o|ciates? But they mu&s;t not judge of the eyes of the community by their own eyes, nor conclude that the brightne&s;s of the &s;un is to be found in tho&s;e fla&s;hes of light which, undi&s;cernable amid&s;t the full blaze of day, are indebted for all their apparent re&s;plendency to the blackne&s;s of that night from who&s;e bo&s;om they are &s;ent forth. Let me advi&s;e the gentleman from Virginia, Mr. Chairman, to forbear his panegyrics. They produce no effect on the deci&s;ion of the Ame|rican public, before which the gentleman from Penn&s;ylvania, with his a&s;&s;ociates, and his opponents, &s;tands to be judged. This judg|ment will be formed on better premi&s;es than the panegyrics or the invectives pronounced in this Hou&s;e. It will place the gentleman from Penn&s;ylvania, and tho&s;e who appear with him on the political &s;cene, in their true po&s;itions; it will not only be impartial, but final and conclu&s;ive; and to it all of us, whatever we may think or &s;ay of our&s;elves, or of each other, mu&s;t implicitly &s;ubmit.</P>
<P>The gentleman from Virginia, having paid this large tribute of flattery to his friend from Penn&s;ylvania, who, to do him ju&s;tice, has not been unmindful of the proper retribution, went on to &s;elect from among his political a&s;&s;ociates another object of enthu&s;ia&s;tic adulation, whom he has extolled in terms &s;till more extravagant, and with al|lu&s;ions &s;till more offen&s;ive. I mean, Sir, the late mini&s;ter to France; and as I &s;hall have occa&s;ion to make &s;ome ob&s;ervations, of no very
<PB N="6" REF="033839_0005_0FF96463D8488998">flattering nature, on the conduct of that gentleman, I beg leave to remark, in the fir&s;t place, that for any thing which I may &s;ay here, I &s;hall not claim the protection of my &s;eat, or &s;helter my&s;elf under its privileges.</P>
<P>The gentleman from Virginia has repre&s;ented the talents and ac|compli&s;hments of this per&s;on, the late mini&s;ter to France, as &s;o pre|eminently &s;uperior, not only to the di&s;tingui&s;hed character (General Pinckney) who was &s;ent to &s;ucceed him, but to every other cha|racter in this country, to any per&s;on who might have been &s;ent, his qualifications as &s;o extraordinary, his &s;ervices as &s;o great, and his conduct as &s;o exemplary, that his recal could be con&s;idered in no other light than as the act of an <HI>a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in.</HI> Yes, Mr. Chairman, the gentleman from Virginia has declared that the recal of the late mi|ni&s;ter to France was the act of an <HI>a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in.</HI> And who is this a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in? It is Wa&s;hington; for by Wa&s;hington this mini&s;ter was recalled; and for this exerci&s;e of his con&s;titutional powers as Pre&s;ident, he is branded by the gentleman from Virginia with the name of <HI>a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. Chairman, were I to give way to the feelings which naturally ari&s;e in the brea&s;t of an American at hearing the epithet <HI>a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in</HI> affixt to the name of Wa&s;hington, I &s;hould apply expre&s;&s;ions to the gen|tleman from Virginia little &s;uitable to the dignity of this place, and little con&s;onant with the re&s;pect which I entertain for his per&s;onal character. But I will repre&s;s them; and in&s;tead of giving vent to a ju&s;t and natural indignation, I will content my&s;elf with repelling this rude, this unlooked-for attack, upon the admini&s;tration of this go|vernment and its late venerable and illu&s;trious chief.</P>
<P>This I am fortunately enabled to do in a manner the mo&s;t ea&s;y and complete; for the late mini&s;ter to France has written a book. <HI>"Oh that mine enemy might write a book!"</HI> was the affecting exclamation of a virtuous and &s;uffering man of old, unju&s;tly accu&s;ed, but con&s;cious of rectitude, and wi&s;hing ardently for an opportunity of confounding his accu&s;ers out of their own mouths! <HI>"Oh that mine enemy might write a book!"</HI> ought al&s;o to be the exclamation of the American govern|ment; which, to u&s;e the expre&s;&s;ion of its late illu&s;trious chief, <Q>requires nothing but a knowledge of the truth to ju&s;tify its mea|&s;ures, and cannot but be de&s;irous of having this truth frankly and fully di&s;played.</Q> The American government has been more for|tunate than Job. His enemies wi&s;ely confined them&s;elves to the &s;trong holds of dark, vague and general abu&s;e. They practi&s;ed the <HI>"Ambiguas in vulgum &s;pargere voces"</HI> of the poet, and wi&s;ely avoided the open field of facts and &s;pecific accu&s;ations. But not &s;o the late mini&s;ter to France. Prompted by that re&s;tle&s;s vanity for which de|magogues of an inferior order are always remarkable, he has ra&s;hly and fooli&s;hly challenged his enemy to combat on the open plain of dates and facts, and has written a book. In this book is to be found the mo&s;t complete ju&s;tification of the Executive for his recal, in every re&s;pect except that it was &s;o long delayed; for the book contains the mo&s;t &s;ingular di&s;play of incapacity, unfaithfulne&s;s and pre|&s;umption, of neglect of orders, forgetfulne&s;s of the dignity, rights and intere&s;ts of his own country, and &s;ervile devotedne&s;s to the go|vernment of the country to which he was &s;ent, that can be found in
<PB N="7" REF="033839_0006_0FF96486222BE4F0">the hi&s;tory of diplomacy. In this book it appears that the late mi|ni&s;ter to France, took every occa&s;ion of thwarting the views of the government by which he was &s;ent, that he forebore to do much that he was ordered, and did much that he was expre&s;sly forbidden; that he, in all ca&s;es, &s;et up his own judgment above the judgment of his government; that he a&s;&s;ured France, <Q>that this country was ready to &s;ubmit to any violation of its rights, to any infractions of its treaties which &s;he might think fit to practi&s;e, and that if &s;he thought the&s;e violations and infractions advantageous to her&s;elf &s;he ought to per&s;i&s;t in them, for in that ca&s;e we &s;hould not only &s;ubmit, but acquie&s;ce with cheerfulne&s;s and plea&s;ure:</Q> that he made a direct attempt to render this country tributary to France, in order to gain her a&s;&s;i&s;tance for accompli&s;hing, by force, objects which our government was then &s;triving to accompli&s;h, and actually did accompli&s;h by amicable negociation: that he did every thing in his power to involve this country in the war again&s;t England, pur|&s;uant to the wi&s;hes and policy of France, and directly contrary, not only to what he knew to be the de&s;ire and determination of our go|vernment, but to the expre&s;s letter of his in&s;tructions. All this, Mr. Chairman, appears from this book, and it is but a &s;mall part of the catalogue which might be pre&s;ented. The book lies before me; its di&s;gu&s;ting pages I will not open to the Hou&s;e; the members no doubt have peru&s;ed it, and to their own recollection I refer for the proof of all that I have advanced. The late mini&s;ter to France &s;tands &s;elf-convicted of every thing &s;hort of &s;elling his country for a price. Of this I do not accu&s;e him, but nothing el&s;e, which his incapacity permitted him to do, has he left undone.</P>
<P>And this, Mr. Chairman, is the man, for recalling whom the epithet of a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in is applied to the name of Wa&s;hington!</P>
<P>[Mr. Nicholas explained, by &s;aying, that he had &s;aid, <Q>that after the full di&s;clo&s;ure of the conduct of Mr. Monroe, he was &s;orry to find that gentlemen thought it nece&s;&s;ary to make in&s;inuations again&s;t him; but that &s;ince gentlemen made it nece&s;&s;ary to give an opinion on the &s;ubject, he had no he&s;itation in declaring, that, in his opinion, the publication had proved that it was in the power of the Executive to have pre&s;erved peace with France, but that they had wantonly thrown it from us. He &s;aid he was con|vinced, that the di&s;covery was a very unplea&s;ant one to gentlemen who had advocated certain mea&s;ures; but he thought it could not be condemned after the attacks made on that gentleman; and that the effect was like the wounds of the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in, who finds his enemy unexpectedly prepared.]</Q></P>
<P>I do not think, (continued Mr. Harper) that the gentleman from Virginia has made the matter better by his explanation. It appears by that very explanation, that he did apply the term <HI>a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in</HI> to Ge|neral Wa&s;hington for having recalled the late mini&s;ter to France; a term which, &s;ome years ago, &s;urely could not have been expected ever to be applied to that name within the United States, much le&s;s within the&s;e walls.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t beg leave, Mr. Chairman, to conclude the&s;e remarks with the declaration wherewith I began them, that I do not intend to
<PB N="8" REF="033839_0007_0FF964AD38686A18">&s;helter my&s;elf under the privileges of my place for any thing that I have &s;aid on this &s;ubject. If the remarks which I have made on his friend &s;hould appear har&s;h to the gentleman from Virginia, let him recollect that he him&s;elf provoked and gave occa&s;ion for them, by declaring that General Wa&s;hington had acted the part of an <HI>a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in.</HI></P>
<P>Having di&s;po&s;ed, Mr. Chairman, of this part of the &s;ubject, I will next advert to the con&s;titutional ground taken by the gentleman from Penn&s;ylvania (Mr. Gallatin). That gentleman prefaced his ob&s;erva|tions, by declaring that the amendment under con&s;ideration went no further than to reduce the &s;alaries of certain mini&s;ters plenipotentiary from 9000 to 4500 dollars; but. unfortunately, he forgot his tenet before he arrived at the middle of his &s;peech, for he &s;oon confe&s;&s;ed that the object of the amendment was to re&s;train and control the Executive in the exerci&s;e of the power of appointing foreign mi|ni&s;ters, which is ve&s;ted in it by the con&s;titution, and having made this acknowledgment, &s;o contradictory to his fir&s;t po&s;ition, the gen|tleman from Penn&s;ylvania proceeded to &s;hew, by the utmo&s;t exertion of powers, that it was right and proper for the Hou&s;e thus to inter|fere, thus to control the Executive, and to u&s;e its power over appro|priations, for effecting that purpo&s;e. Indeed the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Nicholas) at the out&s;et of the bu&s;ine&s;s, expre&s;sly &s;tated this to be the &s;ole object of his amendment. With a candour and openne&s;s characteri&s;tic of his u&s;ual conduct, he avowed that his ob|ject was not to &s;ave money, but to re&s;trict the Pre&s;ident in the ex|erci&s;e of this power. He told us that the diplomatic corps had been improperly encrea&s;ed; that the number of mini&s;ters had been impro|perly extended; that there was danger of a further exten&s;ion, whereby a dangerous executive influence in the Hou&s;e was likely to be produced; and that it was right for the Hou&s;e to interfere, prevent this exten|&s;ion, and bring back the e&s;tabli&s;hment to its original limits; and this he &s;tated to be the object of his amendment. Hence, then, Mr. Chairman, it is manife&s;t, not only from the arguments of the gen|tleman from Penn&s;ylvania, but from the expre&s;s declaration of the mover of this amendment him&s;elf, that the que&s;tion now agitated, is a que&s;tion of power, and not a que&s;tion of money. It is ma|nife&s;tly not a que&s;tion to know whether a mini&s;ter plenipotentiary &s;hall have this, that, or the other &s;alary, but whether this Hou&s;e &s;hall direct the Pre&s;ident where he &s;hall appoint mini&s;ters plenipo|tentiary, where mini&s;ters re&s;ident, and where no mini&s;ters at all. The que&s;tion goes this whole length; for if the Hou&s;e can &s;ay, as the amendment declares it can and ought, that no mini&s;ter plenipotentiary is nece&s;&s;ary at Li&s;bon or Berlin, it can &s;ay, with the &s;ame propriety, and on the &s;ame principles, that no mini&s;ter plenipotentiary is ne|ce&s;&s;ary at London, Paris or Madrid, or that no mini&s;ter is nece&s;&s;ary any where.</P>
<P>That &s;uch is the object of the amendment, that the que&s;tion be|tween us is a que&s;tion of power, and not of money, is further evi|dent from the mode of argument whereby the amendment is &s;uppor|ted. Gentlemen do not pretend that 9000 dollars is too much for a mini&s;ter plenipotentiary at Li&s;bon or Berlin, on that ground we &s;hould chearfully meet them, and agree to a reduction of the &s;alary,
<PB N="9" REF="033839_0008_0FF964D90A503688">if it &s;hould appear to be too high; but they tell us, and attempt to prove, that there is no need of a mini&s;ter plenipotentiary at Li&s;bon or Berlin. In an&s;wer, we alledge, that by the Con&s;titution, the Pre&s;ident and Senate are &s;olely authorized to judge where mini&s;ters of this, that or the other grade ought to be employed, and that this hou&s;e has nothing to do with the bu&s;ine&s;s but fix their &s;alaries, which it is bound to do in a &s;uitable manner. This gentlemen deny; and thus the que&s;tion of power, the &s;ole que&s;tion which has been agita|tated, or is con&s;idered of any importance, ari&s;es between us.</P>
<P>I &s;ay "the only que&s;tion which is con&s;idered as important;" be|cau&s;e the &s;upporters of the amendment have laid no &s;tre&s;s what&s;oever on the que&s;tion of expence. They have, on the contrary, &s;hewn them&s;elves ready to abandon it, for the &s;ake of gaining the lea&s;t ad|ditional chance of &s;upport in the great que&s;tion, the que&s;tion of power. This is manife&s;t from the motion of the gentleman from Marylan (Mr. S. Smith) which was immediately agreed to by the mover of the amendment. By the amendment, as fir&s;t propo&s;ed, mini&s;ters plenipotentiary were to be allowed only at London and Pa|ris. The gentleman from Maryland propo&s;ed, to allow one at Ma|drid al&s;o, becau&s;e he had ob&s;erved that the impropriety of recalling our mini&s;ter from that Court had been particularly in&s;i&s;ted on by &s;ome who oppo&s;ed the amendment. The gentleman from Virginia immediately con&s;ented to modify his amendment, &s;o as to leave a mi|ni&s;ter plenipotentiary at Madrid. From which it would appear mo&s;t evidently, if we did not know it before, that gentlemen care not how many mini&s;ters plenipotentiary there are, nor how much mo|ney is &s;pent in maintaining them, provided the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;en|tatives can obtain the power of controlling and directing the appoint|ment. It is to obtain this power, and not to &s;ave public money, that gentlemen &s;truggle; and provided the principle can but be e&s;tabli&s;h|ed, they are content to have mini&s;ters plenipotentiary as many as any body plea&s;es; for they know that the principle may be as completely e&s;tabli&s;hed in the ca&s;e of one mini&s;ter, as by turning out the whole diplomatic corps.</P>
<P>And notwith&s;tanding all this, the gentleman from Penn&s;ylvania (Mr. Gallatin) tells us that this is merely a que&s;tion about &s;alaries, a que&s;tion of &s;aving 9000 dollars, and wonders how it could lead to a controver&s;y about the con&s;titutional powers of the Pre&s;ident and the Hou&s;e! This proves that the gentleman from Penn&s;ylvania in|tended his &s;peech for a concluding &s;peech, or that he entertains a mo&s;t contemptuous opinion of the under&s;tanding of the Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>I &s;hall, therefore, Mr. Chairman, con&s;ider this amendment as having for its object, and its &s;ole object too, the e&s;tabli&s;hment of this principle: <Q>that the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives, by its power over appropriations, has a right to control and direct the Execu|tive in the appointment of foreign mini&s;ters.</Q> I &s;hall treat the que&s;tion which ari&s;es upon this amendment, as a que&s;tion of power between this Hou&s;e and the Pre&s;ident and Senate, and I &s;hall endea|vour to &s;hew that the amendment, if carried, would be a direct
<PB N="10" REF="033839_0009_0FF965023832D358">breach of the con&s;titution, an alarming u&s;urpation by this branch, on the con&s;titutional powers of the Executive department.</P>
<P>The &s;upporters of this amendment, avowing its object to be the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a control over the appointment of foreign mini&s;ters, contend that this Hou&s;e have a right to exerci&s;e that control, and rely on that part of the Con&s;titution which provides that "no mo|ney &s;hall be i&s;&s;ued from the trea&s;ury without an appropriation by law," As this Hou&s;e, &s;ay gentlemen, mu&s;t concur in pa&s;&s;ing all laws, it follows that it may refu&s;e its a&s;&s;ent to appropriations. In judging whether it will give or refu&s;e this a&s;&s;ent, it mu&s;t be guided &s;olely by its own di&s;cretion, by its own opinion about the nece&s;&s;ity or utility of the object for which an appropriation is wanted. If it &s;hould think this object unnece&s;&s;ary, or hurtful, it is bound in duty to withhold the appropriation. Con&s;equently, it may refu&s;e to ap|propriate for a mini&s;ter to Li&s;bon, Berlin, or any other place, if it &s;hould think &s;uch mini&s;ter, though appointed by the Pre&s;ident and Senate, unnece&s;&s;ary or injurious. This I take to be a fair &s;tate of the argument.</P>
<P>But gentlemen while they lay &s;uch &s;tre&s;s upon this part of the Con&s;titution, &s;eem entirely to forget another part, that part which provides that <Q>the Pre&s;ident, by and with the advice and con&s;ent of the Senate, &s;hall appoint foreign mini&s;ters and con&s;uls.</Q> It will, however, be admitted, that the&s;e two parts of the Con&s;titu|tion are equally authoritative, and mu&s;t both have effect; that the whole in&s;trument, like all other in&s;truments, mu&s;t be taken toge|ther, and &s;o con&s;trued that none of its provi&s;ions may be defeated or rendered nugatory. The&s;e two powers, therefore, the power of ap|pointment in the Pre&s;ident and Senate, and the power of appropria|tion in the Hou&s;e, mu&s;t be reconciled to each other; mu&s;t be made to act as mutual helps, not as mutual ob&s;tructions. How is this to be done? Certainly not by admitting the doctrine of this amend|ment, which would utterly de&s;troy one of the powers; would give the hou&s;e an ab&s;olute control over the appointment of mini&s;ters, and reduce the Pre&s;ident and Senate to the mere power of making a no|mination, which the hou&s;e might refu&s;e or agree to, according to its good plea&s;ure. This is the plain and nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence of ad|mitting the principle, contended for in &s;upport of this amendment, that the hou&s;e, when called on to appropriate for an officer, legally appointed, may, in the fir&s;t place enquire, whether the appoint|ment is nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>Some other way of reconciling the&s;e powers, mu&s;t therefore be found out; and which is it? We contend, Mr. Chairman, that it is thus. An office mu&s;t fir&s;t be authori&s;ed by law; for nobody pre|tends that the Pre&s;ident and Senate can create offices. When the office is thus authori&s;ed, the Pre&s;ident and Senate exerci&s;e their power of appointment, and fill the office. The Hou&s;e of Repre&s;en|tatives then exerci&s;es its con&s;titutional power over appropriations, by providing an adequate compen&s;ation for the officer. In the ex|erci&s;e of this power, they cannot enquire whether the office was ne|ce&s;&s;ary or not; for that has already been determined by the law which authorized it. Neither can they enquire whether the office
<PB N="11" REF="033839_0010_0FF9652847A20E48">was properly filled; for that would be to invade the powers of the Pre&s;ident and Senate, to whom, by the con&s;titution, the right of chu&s;ing the officer is exclu&s;ively referred. What then is their pow|er, and into what may they enquire? They may enquire what is a proper and adequate compen&s;ation for &s;uch an officer? They may fix the amount of his &s;alary: and in fixing it, they mu&s;t be guided by a proper di&s;cretion; by a &s;en&s;e of duty; by the nature of the office, the circum&s;tances of the country, and the public &s;ervice. Thus the con|&s;titution would be reconciled, and each department would act with|in its proper &s;phere. The Pre&s;ident and Senate could make no ap|pointment till the office &s;hould be authori&s;ed by law, con&s;equently there would be no danger of abu&s;e. When they had made the ap|pointment, they could not fix the amount of &s;alary, or order the money to be paid out of the trea&s;ury; another guard again&s;t the dan|ger of abu&s;e. When the appointment &s;hould be duly made, the hou&s;e, on the other hand, would be bound to provide an adequate &s;alary; and could not, by refu&s;ing it, defeat the law and the appoint|ment, becau&s;e they might think the one unnece&s;&s;ary, or the other unwi&s;e, and this principle would be a guard again&s;t any abu&s;e of the powers of the hou&s;e: would prevent it from invading the province of the other departments, and &s;ubverting the principles of the con&s;ti|tution.</P>
<P>Had gentlemen confined them&s;elves within the&s;e limits, had they carried their enquiries no farther than to the adequacy of this or that &s;alary, this debate would never have exi&s;ted. We &s;hould have met them on the ground of &s;ufficiency of &s;alaries, without any reference to con&s;titutional points, or contention about con&s;titutional powers. But this was not their conduct. They expre&s;sly declared, not that the &s;alaries were too high, and ought to be reduced, but that the appointments them&s;elves were unnece&s;&s;ary, and ought to be abridg|ed; and thus they drove us into the con&s;titutional que&s;tion, and compelled us to defend the Executive powers again&s;t their attacks in this hou&s;e.</P>
<P>But, &s;ay gentlemen, is the hou&s;e always bound to appropriate? If the Pre&s;ident &s;hould appoint an hundred mini&s;ters plenipotentiary, mu&s;t the hou&s;e, without enquiry, give money to &s;upport them all? What guard would there then be, they exclaim, again&s;t an enormous and abu&s;ive exten&s;ion of the diplomatic e&s;tabli&s;hment?</P>
<P>To this I an&s;wer, Mr. Chairman, in the fir&s;t place, that we have a &s;ecurity in the re&s;pon&s;ibility of the Pre&s;ident. He is elected by the people, and elected every four years. All the&s;e appointments, tho' &s;anctioned by the Senate, mu&s;t originate with him: and therefore he is particularly, and almo&s;t &s;olely, re&s;pon&s;ible. His character is at &s;take. He is a &s;ingle actor on a mo&s;t con&s;picuous theatre; and all eyes are upon him. He is watched with all the jealou&s;y, which, in this country particularly, is entertained of Executive power. He is watched by the gentlemen them&s;elves who &s;upport this amendment, and who are &s;ufficiently prone to find fault with him and abu&s;e him, even when he acts properly. This he well knows, and con&s;equently will take care to do nothing which may &s;trengthen their hands, by giving them ground for cen&s;ure. Should he act improperly, make
<PB N="12" REF="033839_0011_0FF9654DF7D0F4A8">fooli&s;h or unnece&s;&s;ary appointments, he mu&s;t di&s;gu&s;t his friends and &s;upporters, forfeit the public e&s;teem, and lo&s;e his election. He may be even turned out by impeachment before the time for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> election arrives. The&s;e, I apprehend, are &s;ufficient &s;ecurities <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> wanton mi&s;conduct.</P>
<P>I an&s;wer, in the next place, that if the Pre&s;ident <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> think fit to abu&s;e his powers, it is his own concern, and no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> of this hou&s;e, unle&s;s, indeed, we chu&s;e to impeach him. We are &s;ent here by the people, to exerci&s;e our own powers, and not to watch ever the Pre&s;ident; who, equally with us, derives his powers from the people, and is amenable to them, and not to this hou&s;e, for the ex|erci&s;e of tho&s;e powers. We may, indeed, as individuals, cen&s;ure his conduct, as we may that of any member on this floor, and endea|vour to prevent the people from re-electing him: but, as a body, we have nothing to do with him, or his conduct, but impeach him. If he propo&s;es mea&s;ures to us which we do not approve, we may reject them; in the &s;ame manner as he may reject bills which we &s;end up to him: but we have no more right to prevent him, either directly or indirectly, from making &s;uch appointments as he plea&s;es, than he has to prevent us from pa&s;&s;ing &s;uch votes or re&s;olutions as we plea&s;e. The interference in one ca&s;e is equally uncon&s;titutional as in the other. It has, indeed, become fa&s;hionable, with &s;ome gentlemen on this floor, to con&s;ider this Hou&s;e as "the people," and to &s;peak and act as if the people had delegated to us their general &s;uperintending power over the other departments: but this doctrine is unknown to the con&s;titution, to the utter &s;ubver&s;ion of which it directly leads. It directly leads to that concentration of powers in one popularbody, which it was the main object of the con&s;titution to prevent, and which it was and is the main object of tho&s;e gentlemen to introduce: that concentration whereto this amendment is con&s;idered and intended, by its &s;upporters, as an introductory &s;tep.</P>
<P>I an&s;wer, in the la&s;t place, Mr. Chairman, that if the Pre&s;ident &s;hould appoint an hundred mini&s;ters plenipotentiary, or commit any other &s;uch wanton and fooli&s;h abu&s;e of his power, it would be an extreme ca&s;e, which would &s;peak for it&s;elf, and dictate the line of conduct which this Hou&s;e and the country ought to pur&s;ue. But we never can legi&s;tate on extreme ca&s;es. They mu&s;t be left to &s;ug|ge&s;t and provide their own remedies, when they occur. Suppo&s;e two-thirds of both Hou&s;es, under the influence of &s;ome unaccount|able madne&s;s, &s;hould pa&s;s a law, in ipite of the Pre&s;ident, for build|ing fifty &s;hips of the line, to be given to France in order to augment her navy, or for any other violent purpo&s;e, how ought the Pre&s;ident and the country to act? I do not know: the&s;e would be extreme ca&s;es, and they would carry their own evidence, and the indication of their own remedies, with them. We may as well &s;uppo&s;e extreme ca&s;es of one kind as of another; and however our own &s;elf-love may induce us to think that there is le&s;s danger from us than from the Pre&s;ident and Senate, and that power, however dangerous in their hands, is perfectly &s;afe as &s;oon as it comes into ours, the con&s;titution, and the framers of it, judged otherwi&s;e, and they judged rightly. It is infinitely more dangerous in our hands, when uncontrolled; be|cau&s;e
<PB N="13" REF="033839_0012_0FF96572E86BA030">we have le&s;s per&s;onal re&s;pon&s;ibility, and are far more liable to the influence of pa&s;&s;ion. When, therefore, the&s;e extreme ca&s;es oc|cur, we will act accordingly, and &s;hould they obviou&s;ly require the breach of a law, the nece&s;&s;ity will be univer&s;ally felt and acknow|ledged, and we mu&s;t break it. All that I contend for is, that the pre&s;ent is not an extreme ca&s;e, and that the&s;e appointments being authorized by law, a law mu&s;t be broken before we can defeat the appointments, according to the avowed object of this amendment. I contend that when we undertake to defeat the&s;e appointments, we mu&s;t con&s;ider them as authorized by law, as much as the appoint|ment of a Judge, or a Secretary of the Trea&s;ury; and mu&s;t enquire whether the motives are &s;ufficiently urgent, the ca&s;e &s;ufficiently ex|treme, to induce the nece&s;&s;ity of breaking a law. This is denied by gentlemen who &s;upport the amendment. They contend that the&s;e appointments of foreign mini&s;ters are not to be con&s;idered as com|pletely authorized by law; and con&s;equently that the Hou&s;e may withhold the appropriation without breaking any law. This is the very point in di&s;pute; and to this point I &s;hall direct &s;uch remain|ing ob&s;ervations as &s;eem nece&s;&s;ary to be made on the con&s;titutional que&s;tion.</P>
<P>The que&s;tion then is, Mr. Chairman, from what &s;ource is the office of mini&s;ter plenipotentiary, or any other foreign mini&s;ter de|rived? The officer, we well know, mu&s;t be appointed by the Pre|&s;ident and Senate; but the office and the officer are di&s;tinct things; and before an officer can be appointed, an office mu&s;t exi&s;t; unle&s;s gentlemen are di&s;po&s;ed to admit, as I certainly am not, that the Pre&s;ident and Senate can create offices. The gentleman from Penn&s;ylvania (Mr. Gallatin) well aware that if the office of foreign mini&s;ter could be con&s;idered as legally exi&s;ting previous to the appointment by the Pre&s;ident and Senate, and independently of it, the conclu&s;ion which we contend for would irre&s;i&s;tably follow, has denied this po&s;ition; has denied that the office of foreign mini&s;ter becomes a complete and legal office as &s;oon as the officer is appointed by the Pre&s;ident and Senate.</P>
<P>[Mr. Gallatin explained. He had a&s;&s;erted, he &s;aid, the very con|trary; and had admitted, though he con&s;idered it as a di&s;putable point, that the office was like that of a Judge, and became complete on the appointment by the Pre&s;ident. But he had denied that the Hou&s;e was bound to appropriate for the officer.]</P>
<P>(Mr. Harper continued) I know, Mr. Chairman, what the gen|tleman denied and what he admitted; and it appears by his expla|nation, that I was right in my fir&s;t &s;tatement. The gentleman con|tended, and that was the leading point of his argument, that the office of foreign mini&s;ter was derived from the appointment of the Pre&s;ident; and why did he contend for this? Becau&s;e he knows that the Pre&s;ident cannot erect offices; and con&s;equently if the office of foreign mini&s;ter had no other origin than the appointment of the Pre&s;ident, it could not be con&s;idered as a legally exi&s;ting and com|plete office, until this Hou&s;e had concurred in it. This was the &s;cope and object of the gentleman's argument, and hence his &s;olici|tude to e&s;tabli&s;h the po&s;ition, that the office of foreign mini&s;ter ori|ginates
<PB N="14" REF="033839_0013_0FF8D7357B763E88">in the appointment of the Pre&s;ident. He &s;aid, indeed, that he would admit the&s;e offices to be analogous to tho&s;e of Judges; but he immediately denied it again, by denying that the Hou&s;e was bound by any law to appropriate for the&s;e offices, as they evidently are for Judges; and in denying this, he denied every thing. The gentleman admitted, in form, but denied in &s;ub&s;tance, and con|tended for principles directly at war with his &s;eeming admi&s;&s;ion. The&s;e are complete offices, according to the gentleman, but they were derived from no legal authority, nor is the Hou&s;e bound by any law to appropriate for their &s;upport. That is, they are legal and they are not legal; they are offices, and they are not offices; and that is the amount of the gentleman's admi&s;&s;ion and of his ex|planation. Thus he told the Hou&s;e, on a former occa&s;ion, that he did not di&s;pute the power of the Pre&s;ident and Senate to make trea|ties; he only contended that tho&s;e treaties, when made, were not binding till the Hou&s;e had concurred in them by granting appro|priations: in other words, that the Pre&s;ident and Senate could <HI>make</HI> treaties, which, however, though <HI>made,</HI> were in fact not treaties till ratified by the Hou&s;e; that is, that there might be treaties, which were not treaties. This was the &s;ub&s;tance and amount of that gen|tleman's rea&s;oning on a former occa&s;ion; and it exceedingly re|&s;embles his pre&s;ent argument, as ju&s;t now explained by him&s;elf.</P>
<P>The que&s;tion, therefore, between the gentleman from Penn&s;yl|vania and us, is whether the office of foreign mini&s;ter be derived from the appointment of the Pre&s;ident and Senate, concurred in by this Hou&s;e; or whether it mu&s;t be traced to a higher origin, and con|&s;idered as completely exi&s;ting before the appointment takes place, in the &s;ame manner as the office of Secretary of the Trea&s;ury, or of State, which completely exi&s;ted as &s;oon as the law was pa&s;&s;ed e&s;tab|li&s;hing tho&s;e departments, and before any officer was appointed? We contend for the latter doctrine, and the gentleman from Penn|&s;ylvania for the former. If he be right, it follows that the appoint|ment is incomplete until this Hou&s;e gives its &s;anction; for we well know that the Pre&s;ident and Senate cannot of them&s;elves create an office. If we be right, it follows, that as &s;oon as an appointment is made to fill this office, this Hou&s;e is legally bound to &s;upply an ade|quate &s;alary, in the &s;ame manner as for any other office created by law.</P>
<P>There are two modes, Mr. Chairman, by which an office may exi&s;t; either by law, or by the con&s;tituton; and from one or the other of the&s;e &s;ources the office of foreign mini&s;ter mu&s;t be derived. It is not derived from the Con&s;titution, like the office of Pre&s;ident, Vice-Pre&s;ident, or Speaker of the Hou&s;e; for the con&s;titution &s;peaks of it as already in exi&s;tence. The con&s;titution does not &s;ay there &s;hall be foreign mini&s;ters, and then go on to direct how they &s;hall be appointed, as in the ca&s;e of Pre&s;ident; but con&s;idering the office as already exi&s;ting, it merely directs how it &s;hall be filled. "The Pre&s;ident, it &s;ays, by and with the advice and con&s;ent of the Senate, &s;hall appoint foreign mini&s;ters and con&s;uls." Unle&s;s, then, gentlemen are di&s;po&s;ed to deny that there were foreign mi|ni&s;ters previous to the con&s;titution, they cannot contend that the
<PB N="15" REF="033839_0014_0FF965C2F2AEF5D8">office of foreign mini&s;ter is derived from the con&s;titution. It mu&s;t, therefore, be derived from the law.</P>
<P>But from what law? Not from any act of Congre&s;s; for we know that there is no &s;uch act. Congre&s;s has never done any thing more than to fix &s;alaries for foreign mini&s;ters, and vote money to pay them: And be&s;ides, the con&s;titution, which is previous to all acts of Con|gre&s;s, recognizes the office of foreign mini&s;ter as already exi&s;ting, and directs in what manner the appointments to fill it &s;hall be made. From what law, then, is this office derived? Mr. Chairman, it is derived from the law of nations.</P>
<P>In every civilized &s;tate there are two &s;orts of law, derived from two di&s;tinct &s;ources; the municipal law, and the law of nations. The law of nations, deriving its origin and its force from the con&s;ent of nations them&s;elves, mutually given to each other, is independent of their municipal laws, which have relation to their own internal af|fairs, and depend upon the acts of their re&s;pective governments. The municipal laws of the United States con&s;i&s;t in our acts of Congre&s;s, and are derived from the authority given by the con&s;titution. The law of nations, as it re&s;pects us, has a higher origin, and became bind|ing on us from the moment when we erected our&s;elves into an inde|pendent &s;tate, and entered into the pale of civilized nations. We then gave our con&s;ent to that law, when we began to &s;end and receive amba&s;&s;adors, and to form treaties with other powers. This law, then, became binding on us by our own con&s;ent and our own acts, and this law e&s;tabli&s;hes the office, regulates the duties, and defines the pri|vileges of foreign mini&s;ters. That office, con&s;equently, was e&s;tab|bli&s;hed among us, as &s;oon as we &s;ubmitted our&s;elves to the law of nations. Accordingly we had foreign mini&s;ters before we had a Pre|&s;ident, before we had a Congre&s;s, and before we had a con&s;titution. Even before the fir&s;t articles of Confederation were entered into, we con&s;idered this office as exi&s;ting; for tho&s;e articles do not e&s;tabli&s;h the office, but merely declare how it &s;hall be filled, by whom foreign mi|ni&s;ters &s;hall be &s;ent, by whom they &s;hall be appointed.</P>
<P>The gentleman from Penn&s;ylvania, indeed, has told us that the office of foreign mini&s;ter originated in the appointment of the pre&s;ident and Senate. But where did that gentleman learn that the Pre&s;ident and Senate can create or originate offices? He has &s;aid, that the office becomes compleat when &s;anctioned by an appropriation in this Hou&s;e. But all offices not exi&s;ting by the con&s;titution, mu&s;t be created by law; and where did he learn that this Hou&s;e could concur in a law, by any other means than having a bill before them and pa&s;&s;ing it with the u&s;ual forms? Where did he learn that this Hou&s;e could, in this in|direct way, by voting a &s;um of money, legalize an act not otherwi&s;e legal, and give the force of a law to what otherwi&s;e would not be a law? The gentleman has neither learned this in the con&s;titutien, nor in the proceedings of the Hou&s;e; but though we know not where he learned it, we are well apprized of the purpo&s;e for which he in|troduced it here. That purpo&s;e I have already explained.</P>
<P>It being manife&s;t, then, Mr. Chairman, that the office of foreign mini&s;ter is e&s;tabli&s;hed by the law of nations, it only remains to en|quire
<PB N="16" REF="033839_0015_0FF965E5D5DC6B98">whether that law is complete and binding. Can there be a doubt that it is &s;o within its proper &s;phere? Do not our courts of ju&s;tice acknowledge its exi&s;tence, and yield to its authority as to all objects on which it is calculated to act? Is any aid required from acts of Congre&s;s or other municipal laws, in order to give it efficacy? Certainly not. The&s;e two kinds of law, the law of nations and the municipal law, are each &s;upreme in their re&s;pective &s;pheres. They operate, indeed, upon different objects, and are executed in different modes; but each is complete in its operation. From hence it re&s;ults that an office exi&s;ting by the law of nations, has an exi&s;tence as com|pletely legal, as one which exi&s;ts by act of Congre&s;s: that the office of foreign mini&s;ter is as much a legal office, exi&s;ts as much by the laws of this country, as the office of Chief Ju&s;tice, or Secretary of State; and that when one of the&s;e offices is filled by the appointment of the Pre&s;ident and Senate, the Hou&s;e is under as complete a legal obligation to provide an adequate &s;alary for it, as for the other. This Hou&s;e can no more &s;ay this, that, or the other mini&s;ter plenipotentiary is unne|ce&s;&s;ary, and we will not provide for him, than it can &s;ay, a Chief Ju&s;tice, or a Secretary of State, is unnece&s;&s;ary, and we will not provide for him. It would as much be guilty of a violation of law in one ca&s;e as in the other.</P>
<P>But, Mr. Chairman, if the&s;e conclu&s;ions, and the premi&s;es whereon they are founded, &s;hould be erroneous, if the doctrines of the gentle|man from Penn&s;ylvania &s;hould be correct, &s;till this amendment cannot be &s;upported. It is in direct contradiction with the principles whereon its &s;upporters rely, and is refuted by the very arguments adduced to defend it.</P>
<P>What is the doctrine of the gentleman from Penn&s;ylvania? That the office of foreign mini&s;ter originates with the appointment of the Pre&s;ident, and becomes completely e&s;tabli&s;hed when this Hou&s;e has &s;anctioned it by an appropriation. I &s;tate this to be his doctrine though he did not lay it down in the&s;e expre&s;s words. This is the &s;ub&s;tance, for otherwi&s;e he mu&s;t admit, in direct contradiction to his whole argument, that the office not only originates, as he &s;ays, but al&s;o becomes complete, by the appointment of the Pre&s;ident and Se|nate: in other words, that the Pre&s;ident and Senate can create offices. When the gentleman from Penn&s;ylvania, therefore, told us, that al|though the office of foreign mini&s;ter origina es with the appointment of the Pre&s;ident and Senate, yet the Hou&s;e is not bound to appro|priate a proper &s;alary, as he admits it to be bound in ca&s;e of an office erected by law; the office of Chief Ju&s;tice, for in&s;tance, he told us, in &s;ub&s;tance, that this office, though originating with the appointment of the Pre&s;ident and Senate, remained <HI>inchoate,</HI> did not become a com|plete and legal office, till &s;anctioned by an appropriation in this Hou&s;e. This, Mr. Chairman, is the true doctrine of the gentleman from Penn|&s;ylvania; and it is preci&s;ely analogous to his doctrine of <HI>inchoate trea|ties,</HI> about which we heard &s;o much on a former occa&s;ion. His doc|trine about treaties was this; that a treaty, though made by the Pre|&s;ident and Senate, is but an <HI>inchoate</HI> act, till completed by the a&s;&s;ent and &s;anction of this Hou&s;e. The Hou&s;e, he &s;aid, was in no wi&s;e bound
<PB N="17" REF="033839_0016_0FF8D74A0BD2B7D8">to give this a&s;&s;ent; but when it &s;hould be given, the treaty would then be|come complete. Accordingly, after this Hou&s;e had a&s;&s;ented to the Briti&s;h treaty, by pa&s;&s;ing an appropriation for carrying it into effect, that gentleman told us that the treaty was complete, and had become as much the act of this Hou&s;e as of the Pre&s;ident and Senate. This po|&s;ition he has repeated more than once; and in the debates on the Pre|&s;ident's &s;peech, during the &s;ummer &s;e&s;&s;ion, he laid it down in the mo&s;t emphatic manner. I pre&s;ume, Mr. Chairman, that an "inchoate office" is like an <HI>inchoate treaty,</HI> and may become perfect in the &s;ame manner. The gentleman admits, nay contends, that what he calls an <HI>inchoate</HI> treaty, becomes perfect and binding, to all intents and pur|po&s;es, on this Hou&s;e, and every body el&s;e, as &s;oon as the Hou&s;e gives its &s;anction by an appropriation. Hence it irre&s;i&s;tibly follows, that this <HI>inchoate office</HI> of foreign mini&s;ter, this office originating, according to the gentleman from Penn&s;ylvania, in the appointment of the Pre|&s;ident and Senate, but not binding on the Hou&s;e, and therefore not complete, mu&s;t become complete and binding from the moment when it receives the &s;anction of the Hou&s;e. If not, it never can be complete and binding; mu&s;t always remain an inchoate thing, which would be atmo&s;t manife&s;t ab&s;urdity.</P>
<P>If, therefore, the &s;anction of the hou&s;e can legalize and complete that office of foreign mini&s;ter which originates in the appointment of the Pre&s;ident, this &s;anction has already been given, and the&s;e offices of mini&s;ter plenipotentiary to Li&s;bon and Berlin, which it is the object of this amendment to de&s;troy, have already been legalized and com|pleted by the a&s;&s;ent of this hou&s;e. They are, con&s;equently at this time, according to the principles of gentlemen them&s;elves, completely legal offices; as much &s;o as tho&s;e of Pre&s;ident, Chief Ju&s;tice, or Se|cretary of State; and the&s;e gentlemen, in attempting to de&s;troy them, by withholding an appropriation, are guilty of as direct, and as great an infraction of the law and the Con&s;titution, as if they were to at|tempt to drive the Pre&s;ident of the United States from his office, by refu&s;ing the annual appropriation for payment of his &s;alary. An office mu&s;t either be legal or not legal. If legal, it is equally binding, in whatever mode it became &s;o, whether by the law of nations, an act of Congre&s;s, or the appointment of the Pre&s;ident and Senate, &s;anctioned by this hou&s;e; and there exi&s;ts the &s;ame obligation on the hou&s;e to provide an adequate &s;alary in one ca&s;e as in the other.</P>
<P>Will gentlemen a&s;k when the&s;e offices of mini&s;ter plenipotentiary to Li&s;bon and Berlin, received the &s;anction of this hou&s;e? Le&s;t they &s;hould have forgotten, I will tell them. The fir&s;t received it in May 1796, and the &s;econd from this pre&s;ent Congre&s;s, in June, 1797. It will appear by a reference to the files of the hou&s;e, that on the 28th of May 1796, the Pre&s;ident of the United States &s;ent a me&s;&s;age to the hou&s;e informing it that he had appointed mini&s;ters plenipotentiary to Madrid and Li&s;bon, in&s;tead of mini&s;ters re&s;ident, and that this aug|mentation of the grade would require an additional appropriation. In cen&s;equence of his me&s;&s;age, a bill was pa&s;&s;ed on the fifth of June fol|lowing by which the nece&s;&s;ary appropriation was made. Thus the
<PB N="18" REF="033839_0017_0FF966274574B698">office of mini&s;ter plenipotentiary to Li&s;bon received the expre&s;s &s;anc|tion of this hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Surely we cannot have forgotten what pa&s;&s;ed in this hou&s;e la&s;t June, during the fir&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion of this Congre&s;s. We were informed by the e&s;timates from the department of &s;tate, that 13,500 dollars would be wanted for the &s;alary and outfit of a mini&s;ter plenipotentiary to Ber|lin. A bill was brought in containing this appropriation. The ap|propriation was oppo&s;ed; but, after full di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, it was carried, by a great majority, and the bill pa&s;&s;ed. Thus the office of mini&s;ter ple|nipotentiary to Berlin received the expre&s;s &s;anction of this pre&s;ent Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives.</P>
<P>If the&s;e offices, therefore, were <HI>inchoate</HI> before, according to the doctrine of the Gentleman from Penn&s;ylvania, they became complete, on his own principles, as &s;oon as the&s;e appropriations were con&s;ented to by this hou&s;e; for he has told us over and over, that an <HI>inchoate</HI> treaty becomes complete as &s;oon as this hou&s;e gives its a&s;&s;ent by an act of appropriation; and, by the whole tenor, and the very terms of his argument, he places an inchoate treaty and an inchoate office, on the &s;ame footing: Con&s;equently, he is now bound to appropriate for this office as much as he admits him&s;elf to be bound to appropriate any &s;ums which may &s;till be wanted for carrying into effect a treaty once &s;anctioned by this hou&s;e. And yet that gentleman, and tho&s;e who a|gree with him on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, are content, for the &s;ake of ef|fecting their favourite object, the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a control over Ex|ecutive appointments, to act in direct oppo&s;ition to their own princi|ples, in manife&s;t incon&s;i&s;tency with tho&s;e very doctrines for which, on former occa&s;ions, they have &s;o &s;trenuou&s;ly contended! The truth|s, that they &s;hape their doctrines to the purpo&s;es of the moment; and abandon them, without difficulty, when tho&s;e purpo&s;es require it. When they had re&s;olved to defeat the Briti&s;h treaty in this hou&s;e, they introduced the doctrine of <HI>inchoate.</HI> They alledged that the hou&s;e was under no obligation to carry a treaty into effect, becau&s;e it was only an <HI>inchoate</HI> act till &s;anctioned by this hou&s;e; but they admitted, in the mo&s;t explicit manner, and made it a part of their doctrine of <HI>inchoate,</HI> that when this hou&s;e had given its &s;anction, the treaty became com|plete and obligatory. Now that their object is to turn certain mini|&s;ters plenipotentiary out of office, and to e&s;tabli&s;h a precedent of the control of this hou&s;e over the executive in the exerci&s;e of its con&s;titu|tional functions, they di&s;card their favourite doctrine of <HI>inchoate,</HI> which is no longer adequate to the purpo&s;e. They go farther, and contend that the hou&s;e, by its power over appropriations, has a right to control all the acts, to &s;top all the movements of the other depart|ments: that it may withhold appropriations, in all ca&s;es, according to its own good plea&s;ure or caprice; which the gentlemen dignify with the name of di&s;cretion. There cannot be a doubt that the doctrine now contended for, would enable this hou&s;e to drive the Secretaries, the Judges, and even the Pre&s;ident, from office, by withholding the appropriation for their &s;alaries, if ever they &s;hould become per&s;onally obnoxious to a majority of this hou&s;e. The &s;tep from the pre&s;ent doc|trines to that point, would be far &s;horter than from <HI>inchoate</HI> to the
<PB N="19" REF="033839_0018_0FF9664A1E9F8210">pre&s;ent doctrines; and the right of encroachment being once e&s;tabli&s;h|ed, there will be nothing to &s;et bounds to it, but the good plea&s;ure of the hou&s;e. I have heard it avowed, Mr. Chairman, that the affairs of this country can never pro&s;per until all the pre&s;ent heads of depart|ments &s;hall be driven from office; and I have no doubt that the means of effecting that purpo&s;e, &s;o de&s;irable to the&s;e gentlemen, are intended to be furni&s;hed by this amendment. Should it provail, it will e&s;tab|li&s;h a precedent that may ea&s;ily be extended to that or any other object; and have we rea&s;on to believe, from what we now &s;ee and have witne&s;&s;ed on former occa&s;ions, that the exten&s;ion will not be at|tempted?</P>
<P>Let not gentlemen, therefore, Mr Chairman, accu&s;e us of too much jealou&s;y, when we zealou&s;ly oppo&s;e the&s;e attempts, and charge them with &s;upporting principles which lead to the utter overthrow of the Con&s;titution. I view their principles in that light; and in this view I am fully confirmed by the mo&s;t mature reflection, not only on the con&s;equences of tho&s;e principles, but on the manner in which they have been introduced and &s;upported here.</P>
<P>But, &s;ay gentlemen, what intere&s;t can we have to &s;ubvert the Con&s;ti|tution? Why &s;hould we harbour de&s;igns of overthrowing the Go|vernment, and introducing anarchy and confu&s;ion? Have we not as much at &s;take, as much to lo&s;e, as you? Have we not equally con|curred in the e&s;tabli&s;hment of this Government? And what induce|ment can we have to wi&s;h for its de&s;truction?</P>
<P>Since gentlemen, Mr. Chairman, make this appear to their motives, I mu&s;t be permitted to offer a few ob&s;ervations on that &s;ubject, before I dilate, as it is my intention to do, on the object and tendency of their political &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>As to motives, Mr. Chairman, I have no difficulty in declaring, that I believe the far greater part of the&s;e gentlemen to be actuated by the pure&s;t motives. I do not &s;ay all; becau&s;e I am not bound to an&s;wer for the motives of all. There are &s;ome among them of who&s;e motives I know nothing; but far the greater part of tho&s;e who &s;upport the &s;y&s;tem whereof this amendment is a leading member, are actuated, in my opinion, by motives as pure, I will not &s;ay as my own, becau&s;e perhaps tho&s;e gentlemen may deny me the merit of pure motives, but as tho&s;e of the be&s;t and pure&s;t men in this country: and if I could find &s;ecurity again&s;t the con&s;equences of men's actions in the uprightne&s;s of their intentions, I never &s;hould apprehend harm from the&s;e gentlemen. But, Mr. Chairman, does hi&s;tory, experience, or common &s;en&s;e, in|form us that &s;uch &s;ecurity can be found? Do we not confine lunatics, and keep knives and razors out of the hands of children? Why? Not becau&s;e we are afraid of their intentions, but of their actions; becau&s;e we are ju&s;tly apprehen&s;ive of their doing mi&s;chief without intending it. Is there a de&s;cription of people on earth, who have in&s;pired the world with a firmer confidence in their good intentions, than the Qua|kers? And yet we dread the con&s;equences of &s;ome of their attempts. This &s;ociety, &s;o virtuous, &s;o prai&s;e worthy, and who&s;e in&s;titutions are formed on principles &s;o beneficial and benevolent, have, however, adopted it as part of their creed, have made it a tenet of their religion,
<PB N="20" REF="033839_0019_0FF966690A5DAFC0">that Per&s;onal Slavery ought to be aboli&s;hed; and they go forward with unwearied per&s;everance, to the accompli&s;hment of this object, without regard to ri&s;ks or con&s;equences. In vain do well tell them that their at|tempts, if &s;ucce&s;sful, mu&s;t render the Southern States a new St. Do|mingo, a mournful-&s;cene of ma&s;&s;acre, pillage and conflagration; mu&s;t end in the common de&s;truction of the blacks and whites, the &s;laves and their ma&s;ters. In vain do we hold up to their view the recent and neighbouring example of the French I&s;lands, where &s;imilar maxims have reduced the mo&s;t flouri&s;hing and beautiful provinces to one great Slaughter-pen, have every where mingled the blood and bones of the wretched inhabitants, with the a&s;hes of their dwellings. They an|&s;wer, that they have no intention to produce the&s;e con&s;equences, and do not apprehend them; that it is their duty to proceed, and that the con&s;equences are with God. Suppo&s;e the agents and mi&s;&s;ionaries of this &s;ociety, whom we &s;ee &s;o often attending this Hou&s;e, &s;hould addre&s;s them&s;elves to the gentleman from Virginia who moved this amend|ment, or to his friend from North-Carolina (Mr. Macon) who claim &s;o much indulgence for their &s;y&s;tem on the &s;core of their good inten|tions, and &s;hould &s;ay, <Q>We have the be&s;t po&s;&s;ible intentions: nothing can be more pure than our motives: we mean no doubt to free all your &s;laves, but good, not evil, will re&s;ult from the mea&s;ure: we can have no intere&s;t to produce ma&s;&s;acres, plunder and conflagra|tion throughout your country; and you ought therefore to be per|fectly ea&s;y as to the con&s;equences of our attempts.</Q> Tho&s;e gentle|men might believe all this, and no doubt would believe it, as firmly as I believe them when they make &s;imilar prote&s;tations; but would they think it &s;ufficient rea&s;on for indulging the Quakers in their wi&s;hes; or &s;ufficient &s;ecurity again&s;t the con&s;equences of their &s;y&s;tem? I be|lieve not. I believe tho&s;e gentlemen would act like men of &s;en&s;e, and would &s;ay to the Quakers, <Q>We have no doubts about the purity of your motives; but while we remain per&s;uaded, as we now are, that your plans, however well-intentioned, lead to the mo&s;t direful calamities, not only to us and our families and our country, but al&s;o to the objects of your care, we &s;hall oppo&s;e them with all our might.</Q> This would, no doubt, be the language of the gentlemen, and it would be the language of good &s;en&s;e; and this &s;ame language I now addre&s;s to them.</P>
<P>In fact, Mr. Chairman, does not hi&s;tory teach us there is nothing more common than for men to do mi&s;chief when they mean to do good? Did the L. F. yeties, the Rochefaucalds, the Liencours, the Lameths, and the C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">monts of France, when they fir&s;t taught the doctrines of in&s;urrection, and &s;tirred up the mob to re&s;i&s;t the government, intend to pull down ruin on their country, their families, and them&s;elves? Did they intend to procure their own death or bani&s;hment, and the confi&s;cation of their e&s;tates; to &s;end to the guillotine hundreds of thou&s;ands of the be&s;t citizens, including their own families and friends, to drench the whole country in blood, and transfer the mo&s;t ab&s;olute power into the hands of the vile&s;t of mankind? Certainly they had no &s;uch intentions; and yet we find that the&s;e con&s;equences did re&s;ult from their mea&s;ures; France and the world have groaned and are
<PB N="21" REF="033839_0020_0FF9668770FD0BD0">groaning under the&s;e con&s;equences; nor are they le&s;s real, or le&s;s de|plorable, becau&s;e their authors intended to do good and not mi&s;chief. Fanatics never, or very rarely indeed, intend to do mi&s;chief; and yet all experience proves that no de&s;cription of men is half &s;o mi&s;chievous. They ru&s;h blindly on, without reflection or he&s;itation, and aim di|rectly at the accompli&s;hment of their de&s;igns, without being delayed or turned a&s;ide by any con&s;iderations of the re&s;ult.</P>
<P>This, Mr. Chairman, is the nature, the peculiar characteri&s;tic of all fanatici&s;m, whether religious or political. It hurries on its votaries, with an impetuous and incon&s;iderate fury, which renders them equally deaf to the voice of rea&s;on, and blind to the con&s;equences of their actions. Thus the Quakers ru&s;h forward to the liberation of the blacks; thus the fal&s;ely-named philanthrophi&s;ts of France involved the French colonies in flames and &s;laughter; and thus a &s;et of political fa|natics, in the &s;ame country, in pur&s;uit of their wild and vi&s;ionary theories, put arms into the hands of the mob, taught the populace the doctrine and practice of in&s;urrection, overthrew the government, and were them&s;elves, with their families, their fortunes, and their coun|try, cru&s;hed under its ruins. Their fanatici&s;m impelled them to pull down a &s;tupendous fabrick, the work of fourteen centuries; which by its fall &s;pread death and deva&s;tation over the whole extent of the fine&s;t country on earth.</P>
<P>With the&s;e awful examples before us, &s;hall we tru&s;t fanatic men with power by rea&s;on of their upright motives; or fit regardle&s;s of the con&s;equences of their actions, becau&s;e we are convinced that their in|tentions are pure? So far otherwi&s;e, Mr. Chairman, that, in my opi|nion, their hone&s;ty is an additional rea&s;on for dreading them. Of your cool, calculating, political knaves I am never afraid. Such men are not apt to be much tru&s;ted, and moreover they never do mi&s;chief but when there is &s;omething to be gained by it. They never do mi&s;|chief for mi&s;chief's &s;ake; and being, for the mo&s;t part, men of &s;en&s;e and reflection, you may generally convince them that their own in|tere&s;t lies in avoiding mi&s;chief. But it is the &s;incere, the hone&s;t fanatic whom I dread, and whom I think my&s;elf bound to re&s;train, as I would confine a maniac. His hone&s;ty, his zeal, and his good character, en|able him to in&s;pire confidence and gain pro&s;elytes: the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of upright intentions renders him as bold as he is blind. He ru&s;hes directly forward, without looking to the right hand or the left; pulls down all that &s;tands in his way, regardle&s;s on whom it may fall; de&s;troys a country, in order to make it free; inflicts unheard of cala|mities on the pre&s;ent generation, for the happine&s;s of po&s;terity; and makes experiments on governments and nations, with the &s;ang-froid of an anotomi&s;t de&s;ecting the body of a malefactor. The&s;e are the men of whom I am afraid, and whom I think it my duty, at all times and places to with&s;tand: men who&s;e projects and experiments have brought ruin on other countries, and will bring it on this, unle&s;s they are re|&s;i&s;ted and re&s;trained by the &s;ober and reflecting part of the com|munity.</P>
<P>After all, Mr. Chairman, I am not much afraid of the&s;e men. There was indeed a time when their efforts might have been formi|dable;
<PB N="22" REF="033839_0021_0FF966B642F66858">becau&s;e that phrenzy of revolution which &s;eemed to have been poured out upon the earth like a vial of wrath, which had fallen upon mankind like a plague, did once extend its dreadful influence to this country, where, in a greater or le&s;s degree, it infected every de&s;cription of people, and made them eager for change and ripe for revolution. But it has pa&s;&s;ed away never to return. Fortunately before the di&s;ea&s;e had ri&s;en to its height here, time was given for ob&s;erving its terrible effects el&s;ewhere; and the American people profiting by example, and aided by the peculiar happine&s;s of their &s;ituation, fir&s;t re&s;i&s;ted, and have finally &s;ubdued this dreadful malady, the love of revolution.</P>
<P>In this, I repeat again, they have been aided no le&s;s by their own happy &s;ituation, than by the mournful experience of other coun|tries. For revolutions, Mr. Chairman, are brought about in all countries by three de&s;criptions of men; philo&s;ophers, jacobins, and &s;ans-culottes. They exi&s;t in all countries, and accordingly in all countries are to be found the materials of revolution; but they exi&s;t in different proportions, and according as the&s;e proportions are greater or le&s;s in any country, &s;o is the danger of revolution where|with it is threatened.</P>
<P>The Philo&s;ophers are the pioneers of revolution. They advance always in front, and prepare the way, by preaching infidelity, and weakening the re&s;pect of the people for ancient in&s;titutions. They are, for the mo&s;t part, fanatics, of virtuous lives, and not unfre|quently, of &s;pecious talents. They have always, according to the expre&s;&s;ion of an ancient writer, "Satis eloquence, parum &s;apienti;" eloquence enough, but very little &s;en&s;e. They declaim with warmth on the mi&s;eries of mankind, the abu&s;es of government, and the vices of rulers; all of which they engage to remove, provided their the|ories &s;hould once be adopted. They talk of the perfectibility of man, of the dignity of his nature: and entirely forgetting what he is, de|claim perpetually about what he &s;hould be. Thus they allure and &s;educe the vi&s;ionary, the &s;uperficial, and the unthinking part of mankind. They are for the mo&s;t part hone&s;t, always zealous, and always plau&s;ible: whereby they become exceedingly formidable. Of the three cla&s;&s;es employed in the work of revolution, they are infinitely the mo&s;t to be dreaded; for until they have &s;haken the foundations of order, and infu&s;ed a &s;pirit of di&s;content and innova|tion into the community, neither the jacobins nor the &s;ans-culottes, can produce any con&s;iderable effect. The army cannot find entrance until the&s;e forerunners have corrupted the garri&s;on to open the gates. Of the&s;e men we, in this country, have enough and more than enough.</P>
<P>Of Jacobins we al&s;o have plenty. They follow clo&s;e in the train of the philo&s;ophers, and profit by all their labours. This cla&s;s is compo&s;ed of that daring, ambitious and unprincipled &s;et of men, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing much courage, con&s;iderable talents, but no character, are unable to obtain power, the object of all their de&s;igns, by regular means, and therefore perpetually attempt to &s;eize it by violence. Tyrants when in power, and demagogues when out, they lay in wait for every opportunity of &s;eizing on the government <HI>per fas ant nefas,</HI>
<PB N="23" REF="033839_0022_0FF966D805B5B738">and for this purpo&s;e u&s;e all implements which come to their hands, neglect no means which promi&s;e &s;ucce&s;s. Unable to enter at the door of the &s;heep-fold, they climb in at the windows, and devour the flock. Although they u&s;e the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the philo&s;ophers in gaining entrance, they dread their hone&s;ty, their zeal, and their in|fluence with the public: and accordingly the fir&s;t u&s;e they make of power, when they can obtain it, is to de&s;troy the philo&s;ophers them|&s;elves.</P>
<P>As the philo&s;ophers are the pioneers, the&s;e men are the generals of the army of revolution; but both pioneers and generals are u&s;ele&s;s without an army; and, fortunately, the army does not exi&s;t in this country.</P>
<P>This army is compo&s;ed of the &s;ans-culottes: that cla&s;s of idle, in|digent, and profligate per&s;ons, who &s;o greatly abound in the popu|lous countries of Europe, e&s;pecially the large towns; and being de&s;|titute of every thing: having no home, no families, no regular means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, feel no attachment to the e&s;tabli&s;hed order, which they are always ready to join in &s;ubverting, when they find any one to pay them for their a&s;&s;i&s;tance. The&s;e were the men, who, in the pay of a wealthy jacobin, and under the guidance of fanatic philo|&s;ophers, overturned all order and government in France, and will overturn it in every other country where they exi&s;t in great numbers, and are not oppo&s;ed with great force and uncea&s;ing vigilance. But fortunately for America, there are few &s;ans-culottes among her inha|bitants, very few indeed. Except &s;ome &s;mall portions of rabble in a few towns, the character is unknown among us; and hence our &s;afety. Our people are all, or very nearly all, proprietors of land, &s;pread over a va&s;t extent of country, where they live in ea&s;e and freedom; &s;trangers alike to oppre&s;&s;ion and want. Tho&s;e who re&s;ide in the large&s;t towns are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of property, have homes, families, and regular occupations; and among &s;uch a people the principles of &s;ans-culotti&s;m never did, and never will make much progre&s;s. If a new Duke of Orleans were here, with a Mirabeau for his privy-coun&s;ellor, and an annual revenue of three hundred thou&s;and guineas to &s;upply the means of corruption, he could not rai&s;e a mob &s;ufficient to drive this body from their &s;eats, or over-awe their deli|berations. We have jacobins in plenty, and philo&s;ophers not a few; but while we are free from &s;ans-culottes, and it is probable that the nature of our government, and the abundance of untilled land in our country, will &s;ecure us from them for ages, we need not apprehend great danger. We ought, no doubt, to watch and with&s;tand the enterprizes of the pioneers and generals; but while they remain without troops, they are not much to be dreaded.</P>
<P>Having made the&s;e ob&s;ervations on the purity of gentlemen's mo|tives, ob&s;ervations which were due not only to candour and truth, but to the re&s;pect I feel for their per&s;onal characters, I hold my&s;elf at full liberty to explain the tendency of the pre&s;ent amendment, and of that &s;y&s;tem of policy whereof it is a part; and I mean not to impute any ill intentions to gentlemen, when I declare, and attempt to prove, that this tendency is to the utter &s;ubver&s;ion of the pre&s;ent government. It is my firm and mo&s;t deliberate opinion, that the
<PB N="24" REF="033839_0023_0FF966FBD7016780">amendment new under con&s;ideration, and the principles of that &s;y&s;tem to which it belongs, lead directly to the introduction of anarchy and revolution in this country, and if not &s;teadily oppo&s;ed, mu&s;t &s;ooner or later produce that effect. This opinion it is my pur|po&s;e to &s;upport, by the ob&s;ervations which I am about to offer: and it is by a full convicton of its truth, that I have been induced to confider it as a mo&s;t &s;acred duty, to combat the &s;y&s;tem at all times, and by all the means in my power.</P>
<P>The gentleman from Penn&s;ylvania (Mr. Gallatin) has denied this to be the tendency of his &s;y&s;tem, and contends that our principles, not his, lead to revolution and anarchy. Revolution and anarchy, he tells us, in emphatic language, are the re&s;ults of a &s;y&s;tem of ex|pence, of war, of oppre&s;&s;ion, and of arbitrary &s;way, the la&s;t leaf of that book in which are written the exce&s;&s;es of tyranny. I agree fully with the gentleman in this po&s;ition; but there is another que&s;tion anterior to this, which he has omitted to di&s;cu&s;s. It is by what means tyranny, by what means the exce&s;&s;es of arbitrary government are mo&s;t likely to be produced? This que&s;tion I propo&s;e to di&s;cu&s;s with the gentleman from Penn&s;ylvania; I mean to compare his &s;y&s;|tem, his principles, with our's, and to enquire which of the two is mo&s;t likely to introduce arbitrary government into this country. And I hope to convince, not that gentleman him&s;elf, but the Hou&s;e, that if ever arbitrary government &s;hould exi&s;t here, it mu&s;t owe its exi&s;tence to the &s;y&s;tem of policy which that gentleman &s;upports.</P>
<P>How, let me a&s;k. Mr. Chairman, have the governments of other countries been converted from free into arbitrary governments? By one of two ways; either a military chief, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing little political authority, but hereditary, and having at his di&s;po&s;al the military force of the State, has availed him&s;elf of the frequent wars, whereby neighbouring &s;tates are &s;o frequently afflicted, has augmented that military force, and finally employed it in extending and confirming his own authority; or in &s;tates where no military chief of this de&s;|cription exi&s;ted, popular leaders, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of talents, and actuated by an inordinate ambition, have formed a &s;trong party among the people, have invaded and finally &s;ubverted the authority of the go|vernment, and erected to them&s;elves an ab&s;olute dominion. Every &s;tate that has lo&s;t its liberty &s;ince the foundation of the world to the pre&s;ent day, except in ca&s;es of conque&s;t by a foreign power, has lo&s;t it by one or the other of the&s;e two methods. The fir&s;t is the natural death of free monarchies, the &s;econd of free republics; and both an|cient and modern hi&s;tory furni&s;h many examples of both. It was by the fir&s;t that all the feudal &s;tates were converted into ab&s;olute monarchies except England and Poland, the former of which was protected, by its in&s;ular &s;ituation, from the nece&s;&s;ity, and al&s;o from the con&s;equences, of a great military power in the hands of its chief, and thus pre&s;erved its liberties, while in the latter powerful indi|viduals retained the military force in their own hands, divided it among them&s;elves, kept their chief in &s;ubjection, and at length, by their feuds and civil broils, de&s;troyed the &s;trength of the &s;tate, and delivered it over to be &s;ubdued and divided by the neighbouring powers. It was by the concentration and exerci&s;e of military force in
<PB N="25" REF="033839_0024_0FF967268D434B50">the hands of an hereditary chief, that the Cortes of Spain were bro|ken under Ximines, and the States General of France under Rich|lieu and Mazarine. It was thus that the great princes of Germany became ab&s;olute in their re&s;pective dominions, and that the Ru&s;&s;ian de&s;poti&s;m was founded on the ruins of feudal ari&s;tocracy.</P>
<P>This danger, however, does not exi&s;t in popular governments. They have no great military chief, of hereditary power, who, di&s;|po&s;ing ab&s;olutely of the public force, may u&s;e it for the exten&s;ion of his own authority: and of all republics that ever have exi&s;ted, none ever was &s;o little threatened with danger from that quarter as our's. It is needle&s;s to dwell on the rea&s;ons of this peculiar advantage; for they are obvious to every one. When republics fall, they fall by other means; by gradual inroads on the principles of their govern|ments; by popular encroachments on regular authority; by the con|centration of their powers in &s;ome popular body, where artful, able and a&s;piring demagogues, obtain &s;way, and e&s;tabli&s;h arbitrary power under the name of the people. This is the quarter from which all popular governments have been a&s;&s;ailed, for the mo&s;t part with &s;uc|ce&s;s; and from which our's will be &s;ucce&s;sfully a&s;&s;ailed &s;hould the principles of the gentleman from Penn&s;ylvania ever be adopted. Thus fell Rome under the power of Cae&s;ar; thus fell the republic of England under the power of Cromwell; and thus will fall the United States under &s;ome future Cae&s;ar or Cromwell, unle&s;s a &s;teady oppo|&s;ition be given to the &s;y&s;tem of the gentleman from Penn&s;ylvania, whereof this amendment, let it be repeated, forms a part.</P>
<P>When the examples of the ancient republics was adduced by my friend from Ma&s;&s;achu&s;&s;etts (Mr. Thatcher) the gentleman from Penn|&s;ylvania denied it to be applicable, becau&s;e the government of tho&s;e republics was different from ours. I know, Mr. Chairman, that our government is different from that of Athens or Rome, and I wi&s;h to keep it &s;o. That is the object of all my exertions; of all my zealous oppo&s;ition to motions like the pre&s;ent. To make our government like tho&s;e of Athens or Rome, is in my apprehen&s;ion, the object and tendency of the &s;y&s;tem advocated by the gentleman from Penn&s;ylva|nia. How is this to be effected? By inducing this hou&s;e, &s;ometimes under this, and &s;ometimes under that plau&s;ible pretence, to e&s;tabli&s;h precedents of encroachment on the other departments, to practi&s;e on the&s;e precedents, and extend them further and further, until at length all power &s;hall be concentrated in this hou&s;e, and exerci&s;ed according to the good plea&s;ure of tho&s;e members who can obtain influence here. In Athens, all power was concentrated in the hands of one body, and it was abu&s;ed at the plea&s;ure of tho&s;e who by their eloquence, their wealth, or by any other means, could obtain the confidence and influ|ence the determinations of that body. In Rome, the ca&s;e was &s;ome|what different; but even there, for want of a well fixed balance in her government, the ma&s;s of the people gradually u&s;urped all power, and transferred it to their favourites, or their purcha&s;ers. By pur|&s;uing the principles of the gentleman of Penn&s;ylvania, the &s;ame effect mu&s;t be produced here. This hou&s;e fir&s;t begins the attack on the Pre&s;ident. It controls his appointments, directs his mea&s;ures, gives
<PB N="26" REF="033839_0025_0FF8D78E01D204C8">him orders under the name of advice, and if he refu&s;es to obey them, withholds all the &s;upplies for the &s;ervice of the government. All this is ju&s;tified under the gentleman's doctrine of appropriations. A favourable moment is &s;eized for laying the corner &s;tone, for fixing the principle, and plau&s;ible pretexts are adduced. A treaty is made, and a popular clamour is excited again&s;t it. Advantage is taken of this clamour to refu&s;e an appropriation for carrying the treaty into effect, and thus a precedent of interfering in treaties is attempted to be e&s;ta|bli&s;hed. A foreign mini&s;ter is appointed, the rea&s;ons for who&s;e ap|pointment are capable of being ob&s;cured or mi&s;repre&s;ented. The oc|ca&s;ion is &s;eized to deny an appropriation; and, under the pretence of &s;aving public money, and preventing the expence of an u&s;ele&s;s ap|pointment, an attempt is made to acquire a control over the appoint|ments of officers. The&s;e points being carried, the precedents are &s;oon drawn into practice, and further enterprizes are undertaken in due &s;ea&s;on. Every &s;ucce&s;s gives further &s;trength and boldne&s;s for new a&s;&s;aults, the cannon of every ba&s;tion that is taken, is imme|diately turned on the remaining works: and finally the Pre&s;ident is reduced to the condition of the chief officer of this Hou&s;e, and the heads of departments become the fir&s;t clerks of its committees.</P>
<P>The Pre&s;ident being demoli&s;hed, the party proceeds with new vi|gour, and greater forces, to attack the Senate, which deprived of the &s;upport of the Executive, is &s;peedily overthrown. The Hou&s;e &s;ays to the Senate, <Q>Unle&s;s you conform to our will, we lay our hands on the pur&s;e &s;trings, and &s;top the wheels of government. Should a conte&s;t en&s;ue, we are &s;ure to be uppermo&s;t; for we are the immediate repre&s;entatives of the people; we adore the people; nay we are the people them&s;elves. Therefore beware of a conte&s;t in which you have every thing to lo&s;e, and we are certain of gaining.</Q></P>
<P>The Senate, enfeebled and di&s;mayed, yields by degrees to the&s;e powerful arguments, and this Hou&s;e remains victorious with all power in its hands. It proceeds to appoint a Committee of Exterior Relations, a Committee of Interior Relations, a Committee of Ju&s;|tice, a Committee of Finance; and &s;o on, and a new French Con|vention ari&s;es to view, where principles are &s;et at naught, caprice is law, and the whim of the moment, di&s;po&s;es of all public and pri|vate rights. Then follow confi&s;cations and bani&s;hments, and the long train of tyrannical exce&s;&s;es ever attendant on popular bodies in who&s;e hands the whole powers of government have been concen|trated, from the a&s;&s;emblies of the people at Athens, and the Com|mitiae at Rome, down to the Rump Parliament of England, and the French Convention. Then will the member who &s;hall po&s;&s;e&s;s the mo&s;t art, the greate&s;t eloquence, and the mo&s;t daring &s;pirit of enter-prize, &s;peedily form a party, by means of which he will en&s;lave the Hou&s;e, and rule the country. Should there be &s;everal of equal or nearly equal &s;trength, they will fir&s;t divide the power among them|&s;elves; but their union will be fallacious and &s;hort. They will be employed in attempting to circumvent or undermine each other; divi&s;ions will &s;oon ari&s;e, and mortal quarrels will en&s;ue; till at length the re&s;t will &s;ink beneath the overbearing genius of one, and he will e&s;tabli&s;h his dominion uncontrolled. This is the <HI>liberty</HI> which
<PB N="27" REF="033839_0026_0FF96777CE481CD8">gentlemen, &s;hould their &s;chemes &s;ucceed, will, &s;ooner or later, be&s;|tow on the country, the liberty of a few bold, able, ambitious men to do what they plea&s;e, and of the re&s;t of the community to obey them. This, Mr. Chairman, may be very plea&s;ant liberty for tho&s;e who are to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of power; but for me, and the re&s;t of the community, it has no charms; and I &s;hall, therefore, omit no op|portunity of re&s;i&s;ting its fir&s;t and mo&s;t di&s;tant approaches.</P>
<P>Should any one object, that this &s;tate of things mu&s;t be extremely di&s;tant, I beg him to recollect how &s;hort a &s;pace intervened between the throne of Louis the Sixteenth and the &s;caffold on which he bled; between the ab&s;olute power of Neckar, and the de&s;poti&s;m of Marat; between the &s;plendid fortune of &s;o many di&s;tingui&s;hed families, and the dungeon or the guillotine. Governments like our's, Mr. Chair|man, may be compared to the planetary &s;y&s;tem, who&s;e pre&s;ervation depends entirely on the exact pre&s;ervation of its balance. The exact balance between the centrifugal force and the power of gravitation, retains the planets in their orbits; but &s;hould &s;ome angel of de&s;truc|tion pu&s;h them out of tho&s;e orbits, though in ever &s;o &s;mall a degree, the balance is lo&s;t; one power gains what is taken from the other; and the&s;e immen&s;e bodies, who&s;e beautiful and regular play furni&s;hes the greate&s;t wonder of creation, fly out, and are lo&s;t in boundle&s;s &s;pace, or ru&s;h to the &s;un, with encrea&s;ing and incalculable velo&s;ity, and there are mingled in one mighty ruin. Should the gentleman from Penn&s;ylvania &s;ucceed in his pre&s;ent attempt, he becomes the angel of de&s;truction to our beautiful con&s;titution. He de&s;troys the happy balance of its powers; and the approximation of the different departments, though &s;low and gradual at fir&s;t, would become more rapid as it advanced, and &s;peedily produce that concentration of power in this hou&s;e, which &s;eems to be the object of all that gentleman's labours and cares.</P>
<P>It is this view of the &s;ubject, Mr. Chairman, that &s;timulates me to oppo&s;e this amendment with the utmo&s;t per&s;everance and zeal; not that I apprehend great mi&s;chief from this particular mea&s;ure, could it be viewed &s;ingly and by it&s;elf; but that I regard it as a part of a &s;y&s;tem wholly incompatible with the exi&s;tence of this govern|ment, or the happine&s;s of this country. I regard the gentleman from Penn&s;ylvania and his friends, in the light of an enemy who has com|menced a &s;iege again&s;t the fortre&s;s of the con&s;titution. He proceeds at fir&s;t by cautious &s;teps, and endeavours to make a lodgment by &s;urprize in &s;ome &s;trong and advantageous outwork, from whence he may direct a more efficacious attack again&s;t the citadel it&s;elf. On this advanced ground, in this outwork, I hold it wi&s;e to re&s;i&s;t him; convinced that &s;ucce&s;s here would be the prelude to a bolder and more dangerous a&s;&s;ault; and that all the guns which he can now carry, will immediately be turned upon our remaining fortifications.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t now be allowed, Mr. Chairman, to &s;ay a few words as to the expediency of this mea&s;ure, as to the utility of foreign mini&s;ters. To one &s;ide of the Hou&s;e, to me and tho&s;e with whom I u&s;ually act, it is &s;ufficient to &s;ay that the Pre&s;ident has thought fit to appoint foreign mini&s;ters; for we are convinced, that the right of judging on this &s;ubject, has been given exclu&s;ively to him and the Senate by
<PB N="28" REF="033839_0027_0FF9679E2AFE0AE0">the people of this country, and that when he and the Senate have thought fit to exerci&s;e this right by appointing a mini&s;ter to this or that place, or of this or that grade, nothing is left for this Hou&s;e, but to provide an adequate &s;alary. But other gentlemen hold a different opinion; and content that we may not only enquire how much the &s;alary ought to be, but al&s;o whether the appointment it&s;elf be ne|ce&s;&s;ary. To gentlemen who &s;incerely hold this opinion, I addre&s;s my remaining ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P>The gentleman from Penn&s;ylvania (Mr. Gallatin) has a&s;&s;erted, that mini&s;ters have nothing to do with the intere&s;ts of commerce, except to make commercial treaties; while the care of &s;eeing tho&s;e treaties duly executed, and the commercial rights of individuals properly protected, belongs to Con&s;uls. Hence he infers that foreign mi|ni&s;ters are u&s;ele&s;s; becau&s;e we have no need to form more <HI>commercial</HI> connections, and ought to have no <HI>political</HI> connections, with foreign nations. In order to prove that we ought to make no more com|mercial treaties, he contends that we have received much more harm than good from tho&s;e already made. This is the whole amount of this part of the gentleman's argument, which includes two-thirds of his long and ingenious &s;peech, and it is wholly built on the a&s;&s;er|tion, that <Q>commercial intere&s;ts are managed by con&s;uls, while mi|ni&s;ters have nothing to do with commerce except the making of treaties for its regulation.</Q> This a&s;&s;ertion has been already refuted, and the gentleman from Penn&s;ylvania, though he has made it the ground-work of his whole rea&s;oning, has not attempted to prove it. For this he had very good rea&s;ons; for he well knows it to be wholly unfounded; and therefore he has contented him&s;elf with a&s;&s;erting it and taking it for granted. I &s;ay he well knows it to be unfounded, becau&s;e that gentleman is well read in the law of nations, the writers on which, as well as its maxims and doctrines, we often &s;ee him adduce with much dexterity and learning, when they &s;uit his purpo&s;e. Now, Mr. Chairman, I may, I think, venture to affirm, that there is no &s;tudent in any college, who has read the indexes of &s;ome ele|mentary books on the law of nations, but knows that it is the peculiar bu&s;ine&s;s of mini&s;ters not only to make commercial treaties, but to watch over their execution, and to take care that the commercial rights of their country, under the law of nations as well as under treaties, are pre&s;erved inviolate. This is a bu&s;ine&s;s with which con|&s;uls never interfere, and to which they are wholly inadequate; not only from the nature and powers of their appointment, but al&s;o from their local circum&s;tances and &s;ituation. All this the gentleman from Penn&s;ylvania well knows; and yet he has a&s;&s;erted that every thing re&s;pecting the intere&s;ts of our commerce in foreign countries, except the formation of commercial treaties, can be, and is, tran&s;|acted by con&s;uls, without the interference of mini&s;ters. This a&s;&s;er|tion is the loo&s;e block whereon, for want of a better foundation, he has re&s;ted the whole edifice of his rea&s;onings; and this block I mean to knock away. A very &s;light &s;troke will be &s;ufficient for the purpo&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="033839_0028_0FF967C282A97908">
In what manner, Mr. Chairman, is the ob&s;ervance of a treaty of commerce with any country to be enforced? In what manner are infractions of &s;uch a treaty or of the laws of nations, to be prevented or redre&s;&s;ed? Is it not by applications to the government of that country; by repre&s;entations, by remon&s;trances, by negociations? The gentleman from Penn&s;ylvania will not an&s;wer in the negative. I know he will not. By whom then, and where, are the&s;e applica|tions to be made, the&s;e repre&s;entations, the&s;e remon&s;trances to be pre&s;ented, the&s;e negociations to be carried on? Mu&s;t it be at the &s;eat of government, by agents re&s;iding there; or at the &s;ea-ports of the countries, where the con&s;uls re&s;ide? If the former, the&s;e agents will be mini&s;ters. You may call them by a dif|ferent name, but the thing will be the &s;ame: for a public agent of one country, charged with the management of its affairs, and re&s;iding at the &s;eat of the government of another, is the very definition of a foreign mini&s;ter, by whatever name you may think fit to call him. As the&s;e tran&s;actions are, from their very nature, to be with the government it&s;elf, let us &s;ee whether they could po&s;&s;ibly be managed by con&s;uls.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, con&s;uls, by the e&s;tabli&s;hed law and u&s;age of nations, have no public official character, and cannot be admitted to any intercour&s;e whatever with the governments of the countries where they re&s;ide. We may, if we plea&s;e, exclaim again&s;t this u&s;age, and call it ab&s;urd, or fooli&s;h; but it is the e&s;tabli&s;hed u&s;age of nations, and while it remains &s;o we mu&s;t comform to it. Suppo&s;e, therefore, that any injury &s;hould be done to the commerce of our citizens by French privateers, for in&s;tance, or French municipa|lities, in contravention of our treaty, or again&s;t the law of nations, but under colour of certain acts of the French government. Could redre&s;s be obtained by means of con&s;uls? So far from it, that it could not even be applied for; &s;ince the con&s;uls could have no acce&s;s to the government. And yet the gentleman from Penn&s;ylvania tells us that the intere&s;ts of our commerce in foreign countries can be managed by con&s;uls!</P>
<P>In the next place our con&s;uls in foreign countries, are for the mo&s;t part, natives of the countries where they re&s;ide; with very few ex|ceptions they are mere private merchants; and except in the &s;ingle ca&s;e of the con&s;uls to the Barbary powers, who, according to e&s;tab|li&s;hed u&s;age, are a &s;pecies of mini&s;ters, they receive no &s;alaries. Are men of this de&s;cription adequate to the protection of our commercial intere&s;ts? Can they be expected to po&s;&s;e&s;s the requi&s;ite knowledge for conducting affairs of this kind, or the requi&s;ite influence or weight of character? Will they abandon their own private affairs to attend at a remore capital, and &s;olicit the re&s;titution of ve&s;&s;els, the revocation of injurious orders, or indemnification for improper &s;eizures? If they were qualified for this bu&s;ine&s;s, and willing to undertake it, they certainly would not do &s;o at their own expence. When our con&s;ul at Bourdeaux, Nantes or Mar&s;eilles, for in&s;tance, &s;hould be applied to on any bu&s;ine&s;s which would require an appli|cation to the French government, would he go to Paris, and remain there to fini&s;h the bu&s;ine&s;s at his own expence? Certainly not.
<PB N="30" REF="033839_0029_0FF967DE49C772D0">We mu&s;t pay him, not only his expences, but a compen&s;ation for his time and trouble. As the&s;e applications would frequently oc|cur, he could not go &s;pecially for each one; but mu&s;t remain always there; and we mu&s;t give him a &s;alary &s;ufficient to induce him to do &s;o. He would then be a mini&s;ter in fact, and in expence. He would want nothing of the character but the name, and the capacity of u&s;efulne&s;s. This is the e&s;tabli&s;hment which the gentleman from Penn&s;ylvania wi&s;hes to &s;ub&s;titute in the place of our pre&s;ent diplo|matic appointments. The con&s;uls, in order to perform the duties which he &s;ays ought to be a&s;&s;igned to them, mu&s;t be turned into mini&s;ters; equally expen&s;ive with the pre&s;ent corps, but far le&s;s efficacious.</P>
<P>In the third place, we &s;hould have a multitude of the&s;e new-fa&s;hioned con&s;ul-mini&s;ters; for we have a variety of con&s;uls in each of the great maritime nations of Europe. There is one in every con&s;iderable trading town. In France, for in&s;tance, we have &s;ix or &s;even; perhaps a much great number. Each of the&s;e, upon the plan of the gentleman from Penn&s;ylvania, mu&s;t re&s;ide at Paris; for it would be impo&s;&s;ible for them to be perpetually running backward and for|ward between their re&s;pective &s;ea-ports and Paris, as often as any affair might occur requiring an application to the government. If any gentleman &s;hould doubt of this, let him look at the li&s;t now on the table of between four and five hundred American ve&s;&s;els, carried into the different ports of France, or detained there, contrary to the treaty, and redre&s;s for the capture and detention of which mu&s;t be obtained, if obtained at all, from the French government by means either of a mini&s;ter or of con&s;uls. The con&s;uls, therefore, if they are to do the bu&s;ine&s;s, mu&s;t all re&s;ide at Paris; and in&s;tead of one mi|ni&s;ter we &s;hould have nine or ten; perhaps a greater number. The&s;e ob&s;ervations will apply, with a greater or le&s;s degree of force, to every other country with which we have a con&s;iderable com|merce. And yet the gentleman from Penn&s;ylvania tells us that our commercial relations ought to be left to con&s;uls!</P>
<P>Having &s;een, Mr. Chairman, what the duty of con&s;uls is not, let us now enquire, for a moment, what it is. We &s;hall find them very nece&s;&s;ary agents, though wholly inadequate to the bu&s;ine&s;s u&s;ually committed to mini&s;ters.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, it is their duty to &s;ettle di&s;putes which may ari&s;e between &s;eafaring people of their own nation, arriving in the foreign ports where they re&s;pectively re&s;ide. The&s;e di&s;putes, we know, are apt to ari&s;e between the ma&s;ters of &s;hips and their crews, between the crews them&s;elves, and between the ma&s;ters or crews of different &s;hips; and the&s;e con&s;uls are u&s;ually impowered to terminate them in a manner le&s;s tedious and expen&s;ive than could be done by the local laws of the country.</P>
<P>In the next place, they are to a&s;&s;i&s;t &s;eafaring people of their own country, who may happen to have any di&s;putes with the people of the place; are to make advances to them when in di&s;tre&s;s; and procure redre&s;s for them in all ca&s;es where it can be afforded by the local authorities of their re&s;pective ports.</P>
<P>And la&s;tly, they are to act as agents between the people of their
<PB N="31" REF="033839_0030_0FF9680C404409F8">country, and the mini&s;ter: to inform him of ca&s;es which require his interference with the government, and to facilitate to the &s;ufferers the means of applying to him. They are to be his agents in all the &s;ea-ports; while he is the general and immediate agent of his country with the government. They are to keep him informed of all the ca&s;es which occur in their re&s;pective ports, of violations of treaties or of neutral rights; &s;o that he may be enabled to take the proper &s;teps for obtaining redre&s;s.</P>
<P>The duties of the&s;e agents whom we call con&s;uls, are therefore di&s;tinct from tho&s;e of a mini&s;ter, &s;o nece&s;&s;ary in them&s;elves, and &s;o incapable of being performed except by per&s;ons re&s;iding in the &s;ea|ports, that were all the pre&s;ent con&s;uls, according to the plan of the gentleman from Penn&s;ylvania, to be immediately &s;ent to the ca|pitals, and converted into mini&s;ters under a new name, their place mu&s;t in&s;tantly be &s;upplied by other agents, whom, perhaps, the gentleman would not chu&s;e to call con&s;uls, but who mu&s;t be inve&s;ted with the &s;ame powers, and perform the &s;ame duties. Such is the wi&s;e and notable &s;cheme of the gentleman from Penn&s;ylvania; and thus it is he is to rid us of the expence of mini&s;ters!</P>
<P>Let me be permitted, Mr. Chairman, to propo&s;e another que&s;tion to the gentleman from Penn&s;ylvania. If mini&s;ters have nothing to do with commercial relations except making treaties of commerce, how comes it to pa&s;s that the gentleman is willing for us to have mini&s;ters of the highe&s;t grade with tho&s;e two nations with whom we have treaties of commere, and where, according to him, mini&s;ters can have nothing to do? I mean France and England; with both of which nations we have commercial treaties, and where the gen|tleman con&s;ents to our retaining mini&s;ters plenipotentiary. To be con&s;i&s;tent with him&s;elf he ought to attempt the recal of the&s;e two mini&s;ters, by refu&s;ing an appropriation for their &s;alaries, and to leave untouched tho&s;e of Li&s;bon and Berlin, who may po&s;&s;ibly have &s;ome|thing to do. But this is not the gentleman's object. He has another; which is to e&s;tabli&s;h the principle of controlling the Executive in the exerci&s;e of this part of his con&s;titutional functions, and thus effect a breach in the intrenchments of the con&s;titution; and he will pardon me for con&s;idering this doctrine, about which he has di&s;|cour&s;ed &s;o much, and with &s;uch ingenuity, as a mere pretext to cover his attack.</P>
<P>So much, Mr. Chairman, for the utility of mini&s;ters in general, who appear to me e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary, not merely for making com|mercial treaties, but for protecting the rights of our citizens in fo|rign countries, according to treaties where there are any, and un|der the law of nations, where there are none.</P>
<P>But gentlemen point particularly to the mi&s;&s;ion to Berlin, and triumphantly demand what benefit is to be expected from &s;ending a mini&s;ter to Berlin? What have we to do, &s;ay gentlemen, with the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, or the politics of Germany? To me, Mr. Chair|man, let me repeat it, it is enough that the Pre&s;ident has judged it proper to &s;end a mini&s;ter to Berlin; for to him and the Senate, in my belief, and not to this Hou&s;e, has the con&s;titution con|fided
<PB N="32" REF="033839_0031_0FF96830877FB550">the right to decide on this &s;ubject. But to gentlemen who are not &s;atisfied with this an&s;wer, I will give another, and one which, I promi&s;e my&s;elf, they will find &s;atisfactory. Have gentlemen who object to this mi&s;&s;ion, adverted to the peculiar &s;ituation of Europe at this moment? Have they adverted to our own peculiar &s;ituation? We have a mo&s;t di&s;agreeable di&s;pute with the French republic. France has made peace with the Emperor; and a Congre&s;s is now &s;itting, if not already terminated, to &s;ettle the affairs of Germany, and adju&s;t the balance of Europe. In this congre&s;s intere&s;ts of the utmo&s;t magnitude in them&s;elves, and in the highe&s;t degree important to France, are to be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed; no le&s;s than to de|termine whether France &s;hall extend her borders to the Rhine, or be re&s;tricted to the Meu&s;e; whether more than two millions of &s;ouls, formerly &s;ubjects of the German empire, &s;hall become citizens of the French republic. In this congre&s;s the King of Pru&s;&s;ia is mediator; a youthful monarch, enterpri&s;ing, warlike and ambitious, at the head of three hundred thou&s;and of the fine&s;t troops in Europe, and with a trea&s;ury repleni&s;hed by four years of peace, while the coffers of his neighbours are in a mo&s;t exhau&s;ted condition. With the&s;e advantages, joined to his local po&s;ition, he holds in his hands the balance of France and Germany. Prepared to &s;trike in every direction, he is dreaded and courted by all parties; and e&s;pecially by France, who feels that after Au&s;tria, now exhau&s;ted and de&s;irous of repo&s;e, he is the only power capable of checking her ambitious de&s;igns. Hence &s;he has the greate&s;t po&s;&s;ible intere&s;t to &s;oothe and conciliate him. This monarch po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es all the fine&s;t ports in the Baltic, and a great extent of maritime territory. His predece&s;&s;or, the great Frederick, &s;en&s;ible that commerce a|lone can &s;upply money, the &s;inews of military &s;trength, always felt the greate&s;t &s;olicitude to render his &s;tates commercial; and one of the means by which he hoped to effect this purpo&s;e, was to form connections with commercial nations. This was the &s;pirit of his Go|vernment, and became a &s;tanding maxim in his &s;y&s;tem of policy. Ac|cordingly, having di&s;covered that the United States mu&s;t &s;peedily be|come a great commercial nation, he was among the fir&s;t to form a trea|ty of commerce with us. Is there not rea&s;on to expect that the &s;ame views may be entertained by his &s;ucce&s;&s;or now on the throne? And was it not wi&s;e to do every thing in our power for keeping up a good under&s;tanding with a monarch who has it in his power to &s;erve us &s;o e&s;&s;entially? How is this to be done? By &s;ending a mini&s;ter to his court, renewing our treaty with him which is about to expire, and holding out to him the pro&s;pect of commercial arrangements, not in|jurious to us, but perhaps highly de&s;irable to him, and &s;ufficient to procure his good offices and interference in the adju&s;tment of our dif|ferences with France. Would this interference be unavailing? I apprehend not; for France has too much intere&s;t in keeping well with this monarch to refu&s;e attention to his mediation. His interfe|rence, if he &s;hould chu&s;e to interfere &s;eriou&s;ly, would, on the contra|ry, be more efficacious, in all probability, then fifty &s;hips of the line.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="033839_0032_0FF9684F6CD130B8">
I do not know, Mr. Chairman, that this interference will be ob|tained, or ought much to be expected; but I am fully per&s;uaded that it was wi&s;e to u&s;e the means, to &s;end the mini&s;ter, and make the at|tempt; from which I have no idea that we ought to have been deter|red by the paltry con&s;ideration of &s;aving nine or ten thou&s;and dollars.</P>
<P>But gentlemen con&s;tantly repeat that we ought to have no political connections with the nations' of Europe. This is about as wi&s;e as to &s;ay that a man ought never to have a fever. A fever, no doubt, is a very bad thing, and political connections may al&s;o be bad things; but we already have them, and the que&s;tion is not whether they are good or bad, but how we &s;hall get rid of them. We not only have politi|cal connections, but di&s;putes of a mo&s;t di&s;agreeable nature, growing out of tho&s;e connections. This is atte&s;ted by all the papers on the ta|ble, by various acts of the Hou&s;e, and more &s;trongly &s;till, by the uni|ver&s;al capture and condemnation of our property. It is vain, and fooli&s;h, therefore, to repeat continually that we ought not to have fo|reign connections; but our bu&s;ine&s;s is to enquire how they may be be&s;t got rid of. How is this to be done? I an&s;wer by &s;ettling our pre&s;ent differences, and avoiding new ones. Unle&s;s gentlemen mean to &s;ubmit, and if they do I have nothing to &s;ay to them, having alrea|dy had opportunities, on former occa&s;ions, to &s;ay all that &s;eemed ne|ce&s;&s;ary on that &s;ubject. Unle&s;s they now mean to &s;ubmit, I repeat that the only method of getting rid of tho&s;e foreign connections, about which they &s;o loudly exclaim, is to &s;ettle our pre&s;ent differences in the be&s;t manner we can, and avoid new ones. For this porpo&s;e we mu&s;t employ mini&s;ters; and none could be more wifely employed than the one to Berlin.</P>
<P>This diplomatic intercour&s;e, therefore, about which gentlemen rai&s;e &s;o great an outcry, is perfectly con&s;i&s;tent with a wi&s;h to get rid, as fa&s;t as we can, of foreign connections; and if gentlemen were &s;in|cere in that wi&s;h, it appears to me that in&s;tead of oppo&s;ing the&s;e ap|pointments, they would applaud and &s;upport them. Gentlemen mu&s;t excu&s;e me if I &s;ay that I do not think them &s;incere; that in my opinion foreign relations are merely a &s;talking-hor&s;e, behind which they ad|vance to attack the Admini&s;tration, and the &s;y&s;tem of policy which it has adopted. To foreign relations, and foreign intercour&s;e, in my opinion, gentlemen have no objection, provided tho&s;e relations can be &s;uch as they wi&s;h, and conducted in the manner which they defire. It is again&s;t the nature of the&s;e connections, and not to foreign con|nections in them&s;elves, that the ho&s;tility of gentlemen is directed. For the proof of this po&s;ition, I appeal to the hi&s;tory of the mea&s;ures pur&s;ued by tho&s;e gentlemen &s;ince the commencement of this Govern|ment.</P>
<P>I a&s;k gentlemen, Mr. Chairman, who think with me that the pre|&s;ent attempt ought to be re&s;i&s;ted, whether they can &s;eparate it from that &s;y&s;tem of mea&s;ures which its &s;upporters have &s;o zealou&s;ly and per|&s;everingly pur&s;ued, &s;ince the commencement of the war between France and England? I cannot. I am compelled to view it in connection with that &s;y&s;tem, and it is this connection which makes me dread it.
<PB N="34" REF="033839_0033_0FF96871A7DBCBE0">Viewing it in this connection, the time which is cho&s;en for making the attempt is to me its mo&s;t alarming feature. This exten&s;ion of fo|reign intercour&s;e, which is made the pretext for the pre&s;ent attempt, is not a mea&s;ure of this day. It was adopted in May, 1796, and that was the time for oppo&s;ing it, if the rea&s;ons for the oppo&s;ition were really &s;uch as gentlemen alledge. But no oppo&s;ition, or at lea&s;t none of any cen&s;equence, was made at that time. I have looked over the debate which took place on that occa&s;ion; and I find that although &s;ome objections were made, they re&s;ted on a ground wholly different from that now taken. They were confined to the expediency of the mea&s;ure; but not one word was &s;aid of the danger of Executive influ|ence, or the nece&s;&s;ity of checking Executive patronage. Among o|thers I was mo&s;t &s;truck by the ob&s;ervations of a gentleman from Penn|&s;ylvania (Mr. Findley) which agree preci&s;ely with our pre&s;ent doc|trines, and appear to me &s;o &s;olid and important that I cannot forbear pre&s;enting them to the committee. They are found in the debate of May 30th, 1796, on the exten&s;ion of foreign intercour&s;e, and in the&s;e words:</P>
<P><Q>Mr. Findley &s;aid, that he had voted again&s;t this mea&s;ure in the committee of the whole, and he thought he was right in doing &s;o: but he was now of opinion, that except the Hou&s;e had infor|mation &s;ufficient to convince them that the appropriation was nece&s;|&s;ary, they ought to grant it. He wi&s;hed as much as any one to &s;ave the money of the public; but he believed our government was, in &s;ome degree, obliged to conform to European practices. If we had mini&s;ters plenipotentiary at one court, he did not know where to draw the line. <HI>He believed they &s;hould do be&s;t in leaving the executive to &s;ettle this matter.</HI></Q></P>
<P>The committee, Mr. Chairman, will doubtle&s;s be &s;truck, as I have been, with the contra&s;t between the&s;e &s;entiments and tho&s;e which the &s;ame gentleman, and tho&s;e with whom he acts, have expre&s;&s;ed on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion. The gentleman, no doubt, has good rea&s;ons for his change of opinion, but as I do not know them, I mu&s;t &s;eek for them in the change of our &s;ituation. I &s;hould be &s;orry to &s;ay, or believe, that it is to be found there; but the appearance of the thing to my mind is &s;o &s;ingular, and &s;o alarming, that I cannot conceal it. &mdash;At that time we had no di&s;pute with France; now we have. At that time, the French government had not declared us to be a people divided from our government; now it has. At that time, we were not on the eve of a conflict in which it was to be proved whether the people of this country &s;hall be governed by France, or them&s;elves; now it is to be feared that we are. In this awful, this momentous &s;ituation of our country; when we know that France, in her ho&s;tile mea&s;ures, proceeds on the per&s;ua&s;ion that our people are divided from our government, and this hou&s;e again&s;t the Execu|tive; when we &s;ee mea&s;ures here introduced and pro&s;ecuted with un|equalled zeal, who&s;e plain and direct tendency is to &s;et this hou&s;e at war again&s;t the Executive; to degrade the Pre&s;ident, and hold him up to public view as the enemy of liberty, and unworthy of confidence; can we avoid ob&s;erving, how exactly the&s;e attempts are cal|culated
<PB N="35" REF="033839_0034_0FF96889F83AAB28">to promote the views of France? Can we avoid the im|pre&s;&s;ion of a concert with tho&s;e on the other &s;ide of the water, the impre&s;&s;ion that gentlemen are playing into the hands of a Foreign go|vernment, which is pur&s;uing every ho&s;tile mea&s;ure again&s;t this coun|try? This impre&s;&s;ion I wi&s;h to re&s;i&s;t; but I fear that the public mind will not re&s;i&s;t it; nor can I ea&s;ily re&s;i&s;t it, when I advert to that &s;y&s;tem of alliance with France and war again&s;t England, which was at an early period imported into this country, and has been ever &s;ince pur&s;ued with &s;o much activity and per&s;everance in this hou&s;e.</P>
<P>When I &s;ay this &s;y&s;tem of alliance and war was <HI>imported</HI> into this country, I have no allu&s;ion to any member of this hou&s;e. I have no doubt that it was imported by a member of this government, but not of this hou&s;e; and it was a part of the &s;y&s;tem adopted by the revo|lutioni&s;ts of France, when they re&s;olved to wage war again&s;t all their neighbours, e&s;pecially England, for the purpo&s;e of &s;ubverting the government of their own country, and gratifying their own per&s;onal ambition. This war, we know, was re&s;olved on long before it was declared; and it was then determined that the United States &s;hould engage in it on the part of France. A regular &s;cheme was concerted, according to every appearance, for drawing them into it; the mi&s;&s;i|onary arrived who was to convert us to this new faith; and this mi&s;&s;ionary was a citizen of our own, who was recalled from a public employment in that country, to fill a high official &s;tation here.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Notes by Mr. Harper. For avoiding mi&s;takes, I declare, that in this, and the &s;ucceeding pa&s;&s;ages, I allude to the pre&s;ent Vice-Pre&s;ident of the United States, whom I con&s;ider as the author and &s;ecret mover of this &s;y&s;tem of War again&s;t England, and alliance offen&s;ive and defen&s;ive with France: a &s;y&s;tem which, far from being ahandoned, is, in my opinion, now pu&s;hed with more zeal than ever, by the &s;ame party. Hence all their efforts to keep the country di&s;armed, to deprive the government of the public confidence, and to compel it, by tho&s;e means, to break anew with England, in obedience to the orders of France. For when this breach is once made, they know that a war mu&s;t be the next &s;tep, and then the alliance with France, or rather &s;ubjection to her under the name of an alliance, follows of cour&s;e; an I the&s;e gentlemen would rule the country, under the orders of a French Mini&s;ter, as is now actually the ca&s;e in Holland. I con&s;ider the letter to Mazzie, and Genet's charge about "a language official and a language confidential," joined to the general tenor of this gentleman's conduct, and the book of his friend Mr. Monroe, as full proofs that, an opinion is well founded.</NOTE> Not long after a French Mini&s;ter was &s;ent over to &s;econd his efforts, and he came furni&s;hed with ample in&s;tructions, and fortified with ample means of &s;eduction.</P>
<P>Before this mini&s;terarrived, accounts reached us that the war between England and France was commenced. As we had exten&s;ive and important relations, both of a commercial and political nature, with tho&s;e two nations, it immediately became a que&s;tion, of the greate&s;t importance and &s;olicitude, how we &s;hould act in this critical &s;itua|tion. In the deliberations which took place, on this &s;ubject, in the cabinet of the executive, two very oppo&s;ite opinions immediately appeared; one for war on the &s;ide of France, and the other for a firm neutrality: and there were two men<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The&s;e two men were Jeffer&s;on and Hamilton. The fir&s;t was for war, the &s;econd for neutrality.</NOTE> at that time in the coun|cils of the Pre&s;ident who &s;upported the&s;e two opinions. The ad|vocate of the war &s;y&s;tem, did not venture openly to oppo&s;e the &s;y&s;tem of neutrality, which he knew to be the wi&s;h of the country. To have oppo&s;ed it openly; to have declared, in plain terms, that we ought not to remain neutral, but to engage in the war, with fi|nances
<PB N="36" REF="033839_0035_0FF968A4AA3DCFF0">&s;o deranged, a government &s;o imperfectly e&s;tabli&s;hed, and a condition of affairs &s;o un&s;ettled; would, as he well knew, have di&s;gu&s;ted and alarmed the people, and ruined the project. He there|fore acted with more art and addre&s;s. He laboured to the utmo&s;t to induce the Pre&s;ident not to decide, him&s;elf, upon the que&s;tion of neutrality; but to convene Congre&s;s, and refer the deci&s;ion to them. Why? Becau&s;e it was known that a popular body, like Congre&s;s, was infinitely more &s;u&s;ceptible of enthu&s;ia&s;m, more ea&s;ily wrought on by management and intrigue, more obnoxious to the influence of popular clamour, mobs, and venal pre&s;&s;es, than the cool, delibe|rative councils of the Pre&s;ident. It was al&s;o known that in ca&s;e of a reference to Congre&s;s, the neutral &s;y&s;tem would lo&s;e the aid of its author's talents, who was precluded, by his official &s;tation, for a &s;eat in that body. To this point then the author of the war &s;y&s;tem directed his whole force. He laboured to convince the Pre&s;ident that it did not belong to him to decide the que&s;tion of neutrality; but to Congre&s;s, to whom the con&s;titution required it to be referred; and in this effort, it is well known that he was aided, to the utmo&s;t, by that de&s;cription of people who have, &s;ince that time, omitted no opportunity in their power of hurrying us into a war again&s;t England.</P>
<P>Fortunately, however, the Pre&s;ident &s;aw and avoided the &s;nare. His &s;ound judgment, and penetrating di&s;cernment, enabled him to perceive all the hazards of &s;uch a reference: his good &s;en&s;e prevented him from entertaining a doubt about his con&s;titutional power to de|cide this que&s;tion; and his firmne&s;s enabled him to make, and &s;up|port the deci&s;ion. The proclamation of neutrality accordingly appeared.</P>
<P>It no &s;ooner made its appearance, than the war-party and their chief, rai&s;ed an out-cry again&s;t it from one end of the continent to the other. The French mini&s;ter (Genet) who arrived &s;oon after, remon&s;trated; the popular &s;ocieties formed under his au&s;pices, pub|li&s;hed re&s;olutions; and the venal pre&s;&s;es, the principal of which<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Note by Mr. Harper. The National Gazette, who&s;e editor, Philip Frenan,, was a confidential clerk of Mr. Jeffer&s;on. This paper was the vehicle of all the mo&s;t violent attacks again&s;t the proclamation of neutrality.</NOTE> was under the immediate direction of the author of the war &s;y&s;tem, poured forth abu&s;e again&s;t the proclamation of neutrality, the mi|ni&s;ter who advi&s;ed it, and the Pre&s;ident by whom it was i&s;&s;ued. In &s;hort, Mr. Chairman, no expedient which di&s;appointed intrigue, and an artful, enraged &s;pirit of party could devi&s;e, was omitted for rai&s;ing an univer&s;al popular indignation again&s;t this proclamation of neutrality, and for preparing Congre&s;s to condemn and rever&s;e it. The changes were rung from town to town, from &s;tate to &s;tate, and from one end of the union to the other, on pu&s;illanimity, on na|tional degradation, on ingratitude to France, on &s;ervile &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to England; and this proclamation was furiou&s;ly a&s;&s;ailed, with the very &s;ame weapons which we have &s;ince &s;een employed again&s;t the Briti&s;h treaty, which was ju&s;tly con&s;idered as a part of the &s;ame &s;y&s;tem of neutrality.</P>
<P>The efforts of the friends of war and their chief were, however,
<PB N="37" REF="033839_0036_0FF968B69B05F030">unavailing. The people of America indeed felt a warm, an almo&s;t enthu&s;ia&s;tic partiality for France, whom they con&s;idered as contend|ing for liberty, and on this partiality the party founded &s;trong hopes of &s;ucce&s;s. But the good &s;en&s;e of the people enabled them to di&s;cern that whatever might be their wi&s;hes for the &s;ucce&s;s of France, the intere&s;t of their own country lay in pre&s;erving peace: and they gave, throughout the union, the mo&s;t unequivocal proofs of appro|bation to the proclamation of neutrality. When Congre&s;s met, this &s;entiment had become &s;o &s;trong and univer&s;al, that the war-party did not dare to oppo&s;e it. The proclamation was approved of by Congre&s;s; and the party and their chief once more had a hook put into their no&s;e.</P>
<P>Though a &s;econd time di&s;appointed, they did not, however, lo&s;e courage, nor abandon their &s;chemes. But as a &s;y&s;tem of neu|trality had now been adopted, it was too late to talk of war; and the next &s;tep, therefore, was to explain this neutrality in &s;uch a manner as would render it, in effect, an alliance with France, and a &s;tate of ho&s;tility again&s;t England. This was attempted accordingly; but as the author of the war &s;y&s;tem held an official &s;tation under the exe|cutive, he could not openly appear in it. The French mini&s;ter came forward, and advanced the preten&s;ions, which it was the part of the other per&s;onage to &s;econd and &s;upport in the Pre&s;ident's council. A right was claimed on the part of France to arm, fit, and commi&s;&s;ion &s;hips of war in our ports; to exclude Briti&s;h &s;hips of war under pre|tences which would have applied to every po&s;&s;ible ca&s;e; to inli&s;t crews among our citizens; to rai&s;e armies in our country; and to preclude our courts of ju&s;tice from all cognizance of prizes taken and brought in by ve&s;&s;els acting under French commi&s;&s;ions. It was contended on the part of France, that we ought to re&s;i&s;t, by force, the right claimed by England, and clearly acknowledged by the law of nations, to take the goods of her enemies, when found on board of our neutral ve&s;&s;els. It requires no di&s;cernment, Mr. Chairman, to &s;ee that the&s;e preten&s;ions, had they been agreed to, would have placed the direction of our affairs in the hands of France, and mu&s;t in&s;tantly have induced a &s;tate of war between us and England. This was well un|der&s;tood by the war-party; and therefore, as every body recollects, they aided and &s;upported the French mini&s;ter to the utmo&s;t of their power. The&s;e preten&s;ions, indeed, were repelled by the Pre&s;ident, who adopted a &s;y&s;tem wholly different; a &s;y&s;tem of national independence and fair neutrality: but it is well known to have been adopted con|trary to the opinion, and in &s;pite of the efforts of the chief of this party. When it was adopted, he did indeed defend it, in his official character; but he has taken care to declare<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Notes by Mr. Harper.

<PB N="38" REF="033839_0037_0FF968D25C146290">haranguers exclaimed, the &s;elf-created &s;ocieties re&s;olved, the pre&s;&s;es devoted to the party teemed with abu&s;e; and that in particular which was under the immediate direction of the chief, poured forth one continued torrent of virulent invective. Afraid to attack the head of the executive department him&s;elf, who&s;e tried virtue, who&s;e &s;plendid &s;ervices, who&s;e great and well-earned popularity, could not fail to rou&s;e the public indignation again&s;t any who might impeach the purity of his conduct, all the &s;hafts were levelled at the coun&s;ellor by who&s;e advice the &s;y&s;tem was &s;uppo&s;ed to have been adopted, and by who&s;e talents it was ably &s;upported. It was every where declared, and every where mo&s;t indu&s;triou&s;ly propagated, that this per&s;on had en&s;laved the mind of the Pre&s;ident, and mi&s;led his judgment. Every where, by every pre&s;s and every club, was this per&s;on branded as a &s;peculator, a thief, a plunderer of the public trea&s;ury which was under his &s;uperintendence, a wretch in the pay of England; in fine, the mo&s;t profligate of traitors, the mo&s;t dan|gerous of public enemies. The&s;e calumnies, a&s;&s;erted within the&s;e walls, circulated by members of this Hou&s;e, where indu&s;triou&s;ly wafted from &s;tate to &s;tate, for the purpo&s;e of overwhelming with obloquy and public hatred the author and prop of the neutral &s;y&s;tem, as an e&s;&s;ential &s;tep towards the de&s;truction of the &s;y&s;tem it&s;elf. When the public mind was thought to be &s;ufficiently pre|pared, a direct attack was made on him in this Hou&s;e, for the pur|po&s;e of driving him from his office, &s;o that the Pre&s;ident deprived of his coun&s;els, might the more ea&s;ily be brought to concur in the de&s;igns of the war-party and of France. The charges before circu|lated in a vague and indirect form, were reduced to &s;pecific accu|&s;ations, and brought before this hou&s;e, as the grounds of a vote of impeachment. But although the party had met with &s;ome &s;ucce&s;s while they confined them&s;elves to their &s;trong hold, to the "Am|biguas in vulgum &s;pargere voces" which I mentioned in the begin|ning of my ob&s;ervations, yet when they ventured to fight on the open plain of fact and proof, they were totally routed, when their vague calumnies a&s;&s;umed the &s;hape of re&s;olutions, they were ea&s;ily refuted. Every charge was repelled by a va&s;t majority of this hou&s;e; and the wi&s;e and virtuous &s;tate&s;man to whom his country is &s;o much indebted, ri&s;ing triumphant from the conte&s;t, e&s;tabli&s;hed his fame and his &s;y&s;tem on a ba&s;is more &s;olid than ever. Like &s;ome mighty oak who&s;e roots are more &s;trongly fixt, and new vigour added to its growth, by tho&s;e &s;torms which &s;eem to threaten its overthrow.</P>
<P>Thus the war party were again di&s;comfitted; and in &s;pite of all their efforts, aided by the efforts of the French mini&s;ter, a &s;y&s;tem of fair and impartial neutrality, calculated to pre&s;erve ju&s;tice to all, and keep peace with all, was compleatly e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>
<P>Though beaten, however, Mr. Chairman, they were not &s;ub|dued; nor could they be induced to relinqui&s;h their favourite ob|ject of war and alliance. They waited for a favourable opportunity of renewing the attack, and that opportunity the unju&s;t aggre&s;&s;ions of England on our trade too &s;oon &s;upplied. The&s;e aggre&s;&s;ions, join|ed to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> conte&s;t with that power, and
<PB N="39" REF="033839_0038_0FF968E49534B9E8">the re&s;entments remaining from her former injuries, rai&s;ed a flame of indignation throughout the country, which pervaded all cla&s;&s;es and di&s;tinctions of people, and prepared the public mind for mea&s;ures of ho&s;tility. The occa&s;ion was &s;eized by the war party, and u&s;ed with an activity and zeal which gave them the faire&s;t pro&s;pects of &s;ucce&s;s. The attempts were not direct; becau&s;e in that ca&s;e the people might have been brought to reflect. The great object then as before, was war again&s;t England, and alliance with France; but not one word was &s;aid about war or alliance, words which might have created alarm, and given ri&s;e to he&s;itation. But mea&s;ures were propo&s;ed who&s;e direct and inevitable tendency was to widen the breach with England, and inflame the two countries more and more again&s;t each other. The&s;e mea&s;ures a&s;&s;umed various &s;hapes, to &s;uit the feelings and catch the pa&s;&s;ions of particular individuals, or cla&s;&s;es of men, and were urged with unremitting zeal, and indefatigable in|du&s;try: Sometimes commercial re&s;trictions on the trade of England, were attempted; &s;ometimes the intercour&s;e between the two countries was to be out off, and &s;ometimes confi&s;cation and &s;eque&s;tration were re&s;orted to. Many of our be&s;t citizens, and the firme&s;t friends to peace and neutrality, were impelled by the warmth of the moment, and the in&s;inuations of this party, to favour, and even to propo&s;e or advocate the&s;e mea&s;ures; and nothing was omitted to rai&s;e a &s;torm of popular re&s;entment and public odium, again&s;t all tho&s;e who had the firmne&s;s to with&s;tand them. To &s;peak of negociation, was branded as pu&s;illanimity; to &s;peak of attempts at amicable adju&s;tment, was pro|nounced to be little &s;hort of trea&s;on. Gentlemen for their oppo&s;ition to the&s;e ho&s;tile mea&s;ures, were &s;tigmatized, on this floor, as the agents of England; mobs were hired to burn them in effigy in various towns in the union; the pre&s;&s;es devoted to the war party, a&s;&s;ailed them with continued vollies of calumny; their names were coupled with every di&s;graceful epithet, with every vile accu&s;ation; in the toa&s;ts of clubs, and the re&s;olutions of &s;ocieties; and finally, by all the&s;e means, aided by the continued aggre&s;&s;ions of England, an univer&s;al &s;lame was excited in the country, and the party &s;aw it&s;elf approach rapidly to the mo|ment of its triumph over the &s;y&s;tem of peace and neutrality.</P>
<P>When the country was thus on the point of ru&s;hing down the preci|pice, the Pre&s;ident of the United States, de&s;tined &s;o often to become its &s;aviour, again &s;tretched out his paternal hand, and prevented the fall. Interpo&s;ing the powers of his office, and his immen&s;e per&s;onal popula|rity, between the legi&s;lature and the gulph, at the very brink of which it had almo&s;t arrived, he arre&s;ted its career, and afforded the country time to recover from its delirium. He &s;ent an envoy-extraordinary to make one further attempt at an amicable adju&s;tment of our differences with England, before we &s;hould re&s;olve to terminate them by the &s;word; and by this &s;tep he again broke the mea&s;ures of the war-party.</P>
<P>Their rage was proportioned to their di&s;appointment, and it hurried them into the mo&s;t furious invectives again&s;t the Pre&s;ident, again&s;t the en|voy, and again&s;t all who were under&s;tood to favour the mea&s;ure. E|very
<PB N="40" REF="033839_0039_0FF968F946846948">body remembers, Mr. Chairman, how they accu&s;ed this envoy of being a tool of the Briti&s;h mini&s;try, an enemy to liberty, and even an oppo&s;er of the independence of this country. Every body remem|bers what clamours were rai&s;ed about the uncon&s;titutionality of his appointment; how the clubs toa&s;ted, the orators harangued, and the &s;ocieties re&s;olved. Every body remembers how all the pre&s;&s;es under the influence of this party loudly alledged that the friends of the ne|gociation were a faction devoted to England, and that the Pre&s;ident of the United States, by &s;ending the envoy, had placed him&s;elf at the head of this faction. Every one remembers how the leaders of this party did not refrain from repeating the&s;e accu&s;ations within the walls of this Hou&s;e, and even on this floor. It was in vain that the friends of the mea&s;ure, and of peace, &s;poke to them in language like this. <Q>Let this attempt at negociation be made, and if it fails, we will join you in war. Should England refu&s;e to do us ju&s;tice, when thus peace|ably applied to, we will join you in every mea&s;ure of compul&s;ion. We con&s;ider this as the la&s;t effort at negociation; and &s;o the Pre&s;i|dent has announced it in his me&s;&s;age for nominating the envoy.</Q> No! The&s;e gentlemen now &s;o peaceable, when France repels with contempt, two &s;ucce&s;&s;ive efforts at negociation, and meets all our ad|vances by new mea&s;ures of ho&s;tility, could then be &s;atisfied with no|thing le&s;s than immediate mea&s;ures of coer&s;ion and irritation again&s;t England. A &s;ingle attempt to negociate they reprobated as pu&s;illanim|ity, and the very idea of a compromi&s;e, they treated as a &s;urrender of the rights and honour of the country. When the envoy arrived, and pre&s;ented a memorial, &s;tating all our claims, and urging &s;atisfaction, but urging it in the u&s;ual forms of diplomatic civility, the&s;e forms were converted into a cau&s;e of accu&s;ation, a mo&s;t violent out-cry was rai&s;ed again&s;t this civility, by the very gentlemen who now proclaim their unbounded, and even enthu&s;ia&s;tic approbation of the conduct of the late mini&s;ter to France, who in his fir&s;t addre&s;s to the government of that republic a&s;&s;ured it &s;olemnly and publicly, that this country was ready to &s;ubmit, and to &s;ubmit chearfully, to any infractions of its trea|ties or v&s;olation of its rights, which France might think it for her own advantage to commit!<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Note by Mr. Harper. See Mr. Monroe's book, pages 10 and 34, 35, where this declaration is acknowledged and ju&s;tified.</NOTE> Whence this &s;trange incon&s;i&s;tency, but from an eager de&s;ire of war again&s;t England, and a blind, &s;ervile devotedne&s;s to France? And will gentlemen, after all this, deny that the whole &s;cope of the mea&s;ures, the whole drift of the &s;y&s;tem of their party, has been war again&s;t England and alliance with France?</P>
<P>The envoy, however, continued to negociate, and at length conclud|ed a treaty, whereby ancient differences were adju&s;ted, and the found|ation laid for amity in future. No &s;ooner did this treaty arrive in the country than every artifice was u&s;ed to inflame the public mind, and excite again&s;t it the popular prejudices. Nothing was omitted to de|feat it in the Senate, and when ratified by that body it was attacked by every coffee-hou&s;e politician of the party before it was publi&s;hed, by
<PB N="41" REF="033839_0040_0FF969133885A678">all their pre&s;&s;es, and by the re&s;olutions of all the clubs. When made public, the mo&s;t unheard of means were u&s;ed to overwhelm it with general odium, to rai&s;e an univer&s;al cry again&s;t it, and deter the Pre&s;i|dent from giving it his &s;anction. In every town mobs were a&s;&s;embled, under the more re&s;pectable name of town meetings; tho&s;e of a differ|ent opinion were &s;ilenced by clamour, intimidated by threats, or actu|ally driven away by violence; and all oppo&s;ition or di&s;cu&s;&s;ion being thus prevented, the&s;e a&s;&s;emblages of ignorant and illiterate men, were prevailed upon to vote by acclamation for re&s;olutions which they were incapable of under&s;tanding, and could not even hear.</P>
<P>Thus the appearance of a formidable popular ri&s;ing in various parts of the continent, was exhibited, and the phrenzy caught. It &s;pread wider and wider, and, aided by various auxiliary pa&s;&s;ions, drew into its vortex great ma&s;&s;es of the be&s;t and mo&s;t well intention citizens. The country again &s;eemed on the point of ru&s;hing down the precipice; but fortunately its guardian genius yet pre&s;ided over its affairs. The Pre|&s;ident of the United States again placed him&s;elf in the breach, and re|ceived on his buckler all the &s;trokes aimed at the happine&s;s of the coun|try. He &s;poke to the people; they heard the voice of their father, they li&s;tened and became calm. He ratified the treaty; and the people &s;aid "it is done, and mu&s;t it not be &s;upported," he has done it, and is it not right? They li&s;tened, and were appea&s;ed; they read, and were convinced; they di&s;covered their fir&s;t errors, acknowledged and renounced them:</P>
<P>But not &s;o the party who&s;e object was war again&s;t England at all e|vents. They &s;aw in this treaty the death of their hopes, the final fru&s;tration of all their projects; for this treaty took away all cau&s;e of quarrel between the two countries: and they re&s;olved to make one grand effort for its de&s;truction; which being accompli&s;hed, all the an|cient di&s;putes would be rein&s;tated, with new aggravation; and a rup|ture would be rendered by &s;o much the more certain, as there could be no faith in any new accommodation. To this object they bent their whole force; and this hou&s;e was the place for the attack. When the treaty came before this hou&s;e to be carried into effect, doctrines new to the con&s;titution, and incompatible with its exi&s;tence, were introdu|ced in order to de&s;troy it. The treaty-making power was attempted to be rendered &s;ubject to the control of this hou&s;e; as the power of appointing foreign mini&s;ters is now attempted to be rendered &s;ubject. The treaty was attacked through the &s;ides of the Con&s;titution; a war was &s;ought by the overthrow of our government, and the violation of our plighted faith. But a firm re&s;i&s;tance was given to the&s;e attempts. Enlightened di&s;cu&s;&s;ions &s;pread the truth before the eyes of the people. Warned by the errors into which they had before been drawn, and rou&s;ed by the magnitude of the danger, they ro&s;e in their might, and the party was di&s;mayed, they &s;poke and it trembled; they put forth their hand and touched it, and it &s;unk to the earth.</P>
<P>Thus again, Mr. Chairman, were the projects of the&s;e gentlemen confounded. Thus again were they prevented from effecting their
<PB N="42" REF="033839_0041_0FF96929683C9150">purpo&s;e, &s;o much de&s;ired, of driving this country into a war with England and the fraternal embraces of France.</P>
<P>The remaining hi&s;tory is known. The French, under pretexts &s;o frivolous that not one gentleman on this floor has been found hardy e|nough to defend them, have quarrelled with us on account of this treaty; becau&s;e by terminating our differences with England, it cuts off all hope of our being drawn into the war again&s;t her. In this quar|rel, France, proceeding avowedly on the ground of our being a divi|ded people, oppo&s;ed to our own government, and attached to her, re|pels all our amicable advances, meets them with new injuries, and de|clares that before &s;he will li&s;ten to us, we mu&s;t tread back all our &s;teps, rever&s;e our whole &s;y&s;tem of policy, break our treaty with England, and admit her own con&s;truction of her treaty with us. In this criti|cal and alarming &s;ituation of affairs, the &s;ame de&s;cription of per&s;ons, the &s;ame individuals even. who have &s;o per&s;everingly attempted to bring us into the war again&s;t England according to the views of France, who have &s;o uniformly, and with &s;o much zeal, &s;upported all the pre|ten&s;ions of France, now come forward and make a direct attack on the Executive, the tendency of which nece&s;&s;arily is to divide it from this hou&s;e, when there is the utmo&s;t need of union, and withdraw from it the con&s;idence of the people, when that confidence is more than ever e&s;&s;ential. What is this but a continuation of the &s;ame &s;y&s;tem? And an we be blamed for &s;eeing in this attempt a new effort to throw this country into the arms of France, by rendering the government unable to re&s;i&s;t her; by forcing it, from weakne&s;s, to &s;ubmit to her mandates; to break, in obedience to them, its treaty with England, and &s;ub&s;titute in its place, an alliance offen&s;ive and defen&s;ive with her?</P>
<P>If this be not the object of gentlemen; if it be not their intention thus to &s;erve their country by reducing it to the &s;ituation of Holland, how are we to reconcile their pre&s;ent with their former conduct; their eagerne&s;s for ho&s;tile mea&s;ures formerly, with their tame &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive &s;pirit now; their zealous oppo&s;ition to every thing like negociation formerly, with their equally zealous oppo&s;ition to every thing like re&s;i&s;tance now? If this be not their &s;y&s;tem, then all that I can &s;ay about their pre&s;ent mea&s;ures, contra&s;ted with tho&s;e pur&s;ued by them on a former occa&s;ion, about their former eagerne&s;s for alliance with one foreign nation, and war with another, contra&s;ted with their pre&s;ent declamations again&s;t all &s;orts of foreign connec|tions or intercour&s;e, is to exclaim, in the eloquent language of the gentleman from Penn&s;ylvania, that tho&s;e mea&s;ures form the la&s;t leaf of that book wherein are written the incon&s;i&s;tencies of party.</P>
<P>Whether this &s;y&s;tem of war and alliance, this &s;y&s;tem of fraternity with France, &s;uch as the Dutch now enjoy, and ho&s;tility, under her orders, again&s;t all her enemies; this &s;y&s;tem &s;o &s;teadily pur&s;ued, but &s;o often defeated, &s;hall now at length begin to triumph, I con&s;ider as the que&s;tion now to be decided. It is now to be decided whether an important &s;tep &s;hall be taken towards compelling our government,
<PB N="43" REF="033839_0042_0FF8D7F653DF5B48">thro' debility, to &s;ubmit implicitly to France, towards laying this country, bound hand and foot, at the feet of that haughty, domineer|ing nation. To take this &s;tep, to commence the triumph of the fraternal &s;y&s;tem. I take to be the object, as I know it to be tenden|cy, of the inroad on the executive power attempted by this amend|ment. Hence it is that I oppo&s;e it with the warme&s;t zeal and with all my might; and if my oppo&s;ition &s;hall contribute in the &s;malle&s;t degree to its defeat, I &s;hall neither regret the time I have occupied, nor apologize for the trouble I have given to the Committee.</P>
