<HEAD>AN ORATION.</HEAD>
<P>WHATEVER creates love of our country, and obedience to its laws, cannot be unintere&s;ting to Americans. Impre&s;&s;ed with this &s;entiment, we &s;hall attempt to &s;hew the political importance of Science and Religion, and infer their peculiar nece&s;&s;ity to the youth of America.</P>
<P>An ignorant people, blinded by pa&s;&s;ion, and deluded by the intrigues of ambition, are jealous under the free&s;t government, and di&s;contented under the milde&s;t laws. Animated with enthu&s;i|a&s;tic frenzy, they hurry into tumult and in&s;ur|rection, trample upon law, and &s;et civil authority at defiance. Experience, dreadful experience, has deeply engraven the truth of the&s;e remarks upon the annals of all free governments. Every republic has &s;een and felt the importance of hav|ing the whole circle of &s;ociety illuminated with the beams of &s;cience. Whenever we attain to &s;uch an aera, every one, who&s;e heart feels the lea&s;t glow of &s;en&s;ibility, mu&s;t kneel, and thank the great Parent of nature that he was born an Ameri|can. When we &s;tand upon the eminence of know|ledge, and &s;urvey all the nations that ever &s;hone in the ancient or modern worlds; when we exa|mine
<PB N="4" REF="033633_0003_0FF7AE5542E6DFC8">the complicated principles of their govern|ments, and trace the cau&s;es which gradually rai&s;|ed them to glory, or &s;unk them into ob&s;curity, we &s;hall gaze upon the American Con&s;titution with rapture and a&s;toni&s;hment. Viewing it as the immortal monument of genius and wi&s;dom, as the phaenomenon of the pre&s;ent age, we &s;hall exclaim, <HI>ble&s;t,</HI> thrice <HI>ble&s;t</HI> is America. Ble&s;t indeed, if &s;he always pre&s;erves her rights unimpaired.</P>
<P>This cannot be effected by Science alone. Sci|ence &s;hews the beauty, maje&s;ty and grandeur of our temple; but public virtue only will guard it from profanation. Imagine that di&s;&s;ipation, pro|fligacy and corruption, &s;hould annihilate all man|line&s;s of character, extingui&s;h all public &s;pirit, and <HI>if po&s;&s;ible</HI> all American virtue. How, and by whom, will then be filled tho&s;e public offices, now &s;o dignified with patrioti&s;m and wi&s;dom? Will not all elections be carried on by bribery and venality? Will not every office be di&s;graced by ambition and depravity? Without public &s;upport, will not our Con&s;titution dwindle into mere in&s;ignificance? Amid the general &s;lumber and in&s;en&s;ibility, an American Cae&s;ar &s;tarts up, un&s;heaths the &s;word of civil war, and deluges our country in blood and de&s;olation. Thus the throne of de&s;poti&s;m is erected. Heaven avert the blow! Patrioti&s;m bani&s;h the thought! If ever this time comes, come with it death! But de&s;truction is inevitable, &s;hould we degenerate from the mo|rality of our fathers. Our bark &s;ails upon a boi&s;|terous ocean, convul&s;ed with &s;torms, and if we become inebriated with the poi&s;onous bowls of &s;en&s;uality, it is in&s;tantly da&s;hed to pieces, and we are buried beneath the billows.</P>
<P>The nece&s;&s;ity of morality implies the nece&s;&s;ity
<PB N="5" REF="033633_0004_0FF7AE58CD3A1BC0">of Religion. Without this, in vain &s;hould we boa&s;t of being one of the mo&s;t enlightened nations upon earth. The hand of Science, however, naturally conducts to the altar of Religion. A contemplation of the beauty, harmony and gran|deur pervading the univer&s;e, &s;wells the mind with wonder, and in&s;en&s;ibly hurries it to the object of all adoration: the wi&s;e&s;t men are generally the mo&s;t religious. Religion is the great luminary of America and the world: if extingui&s;hed, all morality is extingui&s;hed; we are involved in night, and changed into daemons of darkne&s;s. Athei&s;m appears: a horrid mon&s;ter, without &s;hape, without &s;ub&s;tance; black he &s;tands as night, fierce as his native hell. See how he tears a&s;under all the tender affections of the &s;oul. The pa&s;&s;ions &s;well into irre&s;i&s;tible torrents, and bear away the props of &s;ociety. Society becomes an agitated ocean, property a &s;hattered bark, and man an exhau&s;ted &s;wimmer amid the contending billows. The&s;e pictures cannot be called delu|&s;ions of the imagination. The aboli&s;hment of Religion in France, produced &s;cenes &s;till more dreadful; &s;cenes, the bare thought of which is &s;ufficient to make the blood of a canibal freeze with horror. Boiling with tyger ferocity, her fanatics plunged the dagger into the hearts of friend, brother, &s;on and parent, with the calm &s;erenity of a &s;mile. Even the tomb afforded no &s;anctuary. Society was converted into a charnel hou&s;e, covered with bones and mutilated car|ca&s;es. We beheld her pri&s;ons echoing with groans, her &s;treets &s;welling with carnage, her rivers reddening with blood, her cities &s;inking in flames. Behold that once flouri&s;hing nation, covered with the funeral pall of de&s;olation! Did
<PB N="6" REF="033633_0005_0FF7AE5B56A374B8">&s;uch horrors ever blacken the hi&s;tory of the mo&s;t abominable &s;uper&s;tition? But Religion is a &s;un, which though it may &s;ometimes generate the clouds of &s;uper&s;tition, yet &s;hines far above them, and re|tains all its native &s;plendour. Religion expands the &s;oul, and warms it with patrioti&s;m and uni|ver&s;al philanthropy. It unnerves the malevolent pa&s;&s;ions, creates and invigorates the &s;ocial affec|tions, and cheri&s;hes all tho&s;e noble &s;entiments of natural relation&s;hip, that lay the foundation of political freedom.</P>
<P>Called by the voice of Religion, Americans, like the children of I&s;rael, fled from oppre&s;&s;ion, and &s;ettled in a land of &s;trangers. When famine and death &s;tared them in the face, heaven inter|po&s;ed, &s;hielded from danger, and long crowned them with pro&s;perity and happine&s;s. When we their &s;ons were falling beneath the &s;word of war, the great God of armies gave us a <HI>Jo&s;hua</HI> to &s;ub|due our foes, and conduct us to victory and glo|ry. Now, when again threatened with de&s;truc|tion, the &s;ame overruling Power has not only pre&s;erved this venerable patriot a &s;econd time to head our armies, but has rai&s;ed up a <HI>Solomon</HI> to direct our councils.</P>
<P>Thus miraculou&s;ly favoured, let our brea&s;ts always glow with piety and devotion to the &s;u|preme Arbiter of nations, and Ruler of the uni|ver&s;e. Then &s;hall the trees of Science and Re|ligion, naturally interweaving their branches, and &s;upporting each other, ri&s;e above the clouds, and over&s;hadow the whole Union. Mild concord &s;hall reign, and &s;ilence the clamour of faction. The hatchet of indu&s;try, wielded by the &s;trong arm of freedom, &s;hall re&s;ound from the &s;hores of the Atlantic to the banks of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi. Ame|ricans
<PB N="7" REF="033633_0006_0FF7AE5CE29516A0">&s;hall become one great family of brothers, all animated with the &s;ame virtue, with the &s;ame patrioti&s;m, with the &s;ame irre&s;i&s;tible ardour for independence.</P>
<P>Such, ye <HI>Youth of America,</HI> is the importance of Science and Religion. Soon, alas! too &s;oon, will our fathers be tran&s;lated to the &s;tarry man|&s;ions of their God. Then will be depo&s;ited in our hands the Con&s;titution framed by their wi&s;|dom, and the independence won by their blood. By us alone can the invaluable legacies be tran&s;|mitted to po&s;terity. Yes, upon us depend the freedom and happine&s;s of millions yet unborn. The voice of our fathers, the voice of po&s;terity, therefore, call upon us always to venerate Science and Religion; and at this awful cri&s;is in parti|cular, they exhort us to cling to them, as to the pillars of our political &s;alvation.</P>
<P>Behold! that fell daemon, Athei&s;m, i&s;&s;ues from night and chaos, demoli&s;hes the government of France, and erects his throne upon its ruins. While he vociferates <HI>liberty</HI> and <HI>equality,</HI> he bran|di&s;hes the thunderbolts of <HI>de&s;poti&s;m,</HI> and &s;tains the charter of freedom with the blood of its mar|tyrs. Un&s;atiated with the &s;poils of one kingdom, with giant &s;trides he encompa&s;&s;es Europe, de|&s;troys the monuments of art, tramples upon the &s;ons of Science, tears down the altars of Religion, and deluges the world in blood. The earth trem|bles, the &s;ky blackens&mdash;the mon&s;ter approaches, and extends his arms to America. She, &s;e|cure in native innocence, averts with &s;corn his foul embrace, and repo&s;es her confidence in hea|ven and the unanimity of her &s;ons. The voice of Science and Religion cries, to arms, to arms. Great WASHINGTON leaves the &s;hades of retire|ment,
<PB N="8" REF="033633_0007_0FF7AE5E6CEFD860">draws the &s;word of death, and points to victory. The indignant &s;hades of WARREN and MONTGOMERY &s;tart from their tombs, point at the wounds of their country, and cry aloud, re|venge for our injured rights! My Brothers, &s;wear to guard from profanation the altars of your Re|ligion and Liberty. Rally with your fathers around the fortre&s;s of independence, and nobly re&s;olve to <HI>defend</HI> it&mdash;or <HI>die.</HI> Alas! &s;hould you fall, your tomb would be the tomb of Science, of Religion, of Liberty, of America, and Man.</P>
