<P>Secondly, we were burthened with a mo&s;t De&s;truc|tive, alarming, and uncon&s;titutional Act of Parliament, (<HI>to wit</HI> the Stamp Act) and that from our Mother Country, the Thoughts of which alarmed every con|&s;iderate Brea&s;t, from the highe&s;t to the lowe&s;t Bank of People: every one calling out for Liberty and Pro|perty: The Con&s;equence of which, was, that by a &s;teady, firm and undaunted Re&s;olution, in Oppo&s;ition to &s;o uncon&s;titutional an Act; we as Freemen held our Right to Freedom, and boldly with&s;tood the Threats, and at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">th were heard by our Mother, our Grievance red<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;&s;ed, and we re&s;tored to our former Liberties.</P>

<PB N="8" REF="041951_0006_101B72D4E556FD90">Tree: My Advice to you is, to collect a Body toge|ther, and to forbid them entering the County Hou&s;e, except &s;uch as are concerned in Kings Bu&s;ine&s;s; let them with the Court proceed on &s;uch Bu&s;ine&s;s, and no farther; let us bear true Allegiance to our Rightful Sovereign, GEORGE the Third, whom God pro&s;per; but not bear Allegiance to a Set of uncharitable and ungrateful L&mdash;yrs; let their Money be deemed a Cur&s;e, their Company a Di&s;grace, their Practice un|warrantable, the very Sight of them an Aggravation; let &s;uch who encourage them, be deemed a public Nu&s;ance, and Enemies to their Country. Tho&s;e L&mdash;yrs, will tell you they do not act of them&s;elves, but that their Clients order them, which may be the Ca&s;e in Part; but con&s;ider their Practice after Judgment,&mdash;they will grant Execution again&s;t a Man's Goods and Chat|tels, Lands and Tenements, ordering the Sheriff to &s;ell them at all Events, let it &s;ell for what it will; the She|riff is thereby obliged to &s;ell, to &s;ave him&s;elf; but be|fore the Sheriff can have Time to make the Money of the Man's E&s;tate, which is due, the L&mdash;yrs will grant what they call a Ca&s;a, for the Re&s;idue; and by the Time that is returnable, they will have an E&s;cape again&s;t the Sheriff, for not confining the Debtor to Goal, and &s;o make a treble Bill of Co&s;t, before the Fir&s;t has had Time to be &s;ettled; when the Whole comes to a Conclu&s;ion, perhaps they have not rai&s;ed Money to pay one Third Part of the Co&s;t; well then, the artful L&mdash;yr, will &s;ay to his Client, I have done all in my Power to &s;erve you, I have been dili|gent in my Bu&s;ine&s;s for you, and am &s;orry Matters have turned out &s;o bad, but you &s;ee I could do no bet|ter; you will be &s;o kind as to pay the Remainder of the Co&s;t; and then the Creditor may think him&s;elf well off it he has not above Fifteen or Twenty Pounds Co&s;t to pay.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="041951_0007_101B72D8EB32AB88">
Now, I would give a Word of Advice to Creditors: You &s;ee by the above Practices of the Gentlemen of the Law, how artful they are a taking your Money from you; yea, more &s;o than the noted Robin Hood, the great Robber; for he would do it to your Face, and let you know what he was about to do; but tho&s;e Gentle|men will take it from you &s;miling, and telling of you a fair and plau&s;ible Story: Note, the above Ca&s;e, per|haps, had the Creditors taken the Debtor's E&s;tate, and made the be&s;t of it, he would have got his Whole Money, and the Debtor left at Freedom; but now you find the Creditor has lo&s;t his Demands, and obliged to pay a con&s;iderable Co&s;t, and the poor Debtor in Con|finement.</P>
<P>So I conclude with this my Advice to you, open your Eyes, and every one &s;ee for him&s;elf and his Friend, is the Prayer, of a Friend to the Public in General.</P>

<P>MY dear Friends and Countrymen, plea&s;e to con|&s;ider the critical and mo&s;t lamentable State our County of Monmouth is in, from the licen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ious Liberties, that the voracious L&mdash;yrs take in their Practices of the Law; and which is wor&s;e, they get their Abominations &s;anctified el&s;ewhere; to the utter undoing of whole Families, <HI>(to wit)</HI> One Per&s;on was &s;ued for Seven Pounds, on a Note; the Per&s;on paid the Sheriff, &pound; 16, the Sheriff told the Per&s;on that the afore&s;aid Sum was not &s;ufficient for Debt and Co&s;t, but mu&s;t have Goods in Execution, which he took to treble the Value of the Debt, be&s;ides the &s;ixteen Pounds; before the Money could be had, an E&s;cape was brought again&s;t the Sheriff, &s;o that the Debt and Co&s;t, with Forty Shillings Intere&s;t, came to Twenty Five Pounds.</P>
<P>Another, Per&s;on was &s;ued upon a Bond in Judg|ment, the Defendent confe&s;&s;ed Judgment, to prevent fur|ther Co&s;t; yet the Co&s;ts in Six Months, amounted to above Fifteen Pounds: Another Per&s;on was &s;ued for Eight Pounds, upon a Book Debt, Judgment and Ex|ecution
<PB N="11" REF="041951_0009_101B72E14CE14D60">were obtained again&s;t &s;aid Per&s;on, and he died inte&s;tate; his Admini&s;trators had Twenty eight or Thirty Pounds Co&s;t to pay to a preying Vulture, when Forty Shillings would have been full enough: Thus have we a Widow left with four or five &s;mall Children, in a lonely Cottage, almo&s;t without Bread to &s;upport Na|ture, or Clothing to keep them from the Extremity of the Cold! What a pretty Article would it have been to them in a Chri&s;tian Land, that the Law &s;hould have &s;ecured the Sum, thus obtained by the above &s;aid Extortion, for the Relief of tho&s;e little innocent Ones? when alas! they have now nothing left but Penury and Want.) To number or &s;um up the Whole of &s;uch Tran&s;actions and Extortions, that are perpetrated under Pretence of Law, is needle&s;s, &s;ince a Letter found at Freehold, in the County of Monmouth, June 21&s;t, 1769, will fully de|mon&s;trate the L&mdash;yrs Abominations, which, if not timely prevented, will be the Ca&s;e of Hundreds of Fa|milies in this County; the&s;e crying and abominable Practices, as is &s;et forth in the afore&s;aid Letter, are at this Time thoroughly known by the major Part of the County. For Heaven's Sake! Can it be thought, that the wi&s;e and merciful Creator, made a few Men to go|vern as Gods, and the re&s;t of Mankind to be governed as Bea&s;ts? The Almighty has form'd us, to get our Bread by the Sweat of our Brow, and he that doth it not, is a u&s;ele&s;s Member, and ought to be turned out of Society, which are the L&mdash;yrs.</P>

And now my brave Countrymen ari&s;e, and let us

<P>THE Petition of the Sub&s;cribers, humbly &s;heweth, Your Petitioners beg Leave to lay before your Honours, the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed State of &s;aid County, &amp;c. Your Honours will readily allow, that &s;uch a Time of Di&s;|tre&s;s, among the Inhabitants, never was, &s;ince this was a County; which Di&s;tre&s;s we conceive, ari&s;es in a great Mea&s;ure, from the irregular U&s;e of the Law, made by tho&s;e Gentleman, called Lawyers, of which many In&s;tances might be numbered, which we think unnece&s;&s;ary, as your Honours are not Strangers to the Proceedings of tho&s;e Gentlemen afore&s;aid; we daily &s;ee their oppre&s;&s;ive Practices increa&s;e; we under&s;tand that there are now between 130 and 150 e&s;cape Writs &s;erved upon our late Sheriff, returnable to this Court, which is enough to alarm the mo&s;t &s;tupid of Mankind: We your Petitioners had thought not to make my Com|plaint, until we had a Legi&s;lative Power to complain to; but as we are at Pre&s;ent deprived of that Power, we are now under the Nece&s;&s;ity of laying our Com|plaints before your Honours; we are of Opinion that unle&s;s there is an immediate Stop put to the Proceedings and abominable Practice of the afore&s;aid Gentlem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n,

We farther pray, that there may be a Stop put to the afore&s;aid Practices, by ma|king a Rule in this Court, that all Proceedings in the Law Way (King's Bu&s;ine&s;s excepted) be &s;topped un|til we your Petitioners, with the remaining Part of this County, have an Opportunity to lay our Grievance<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> before the Legi&s;lative Power; &s;urely your Honours wi&s;ely con&s;idered the Alarms of the Stamp-Act, and &s;toped Proceedings upon the Account of &s;aid Act, to the great Satisfaction of the Public; and &s;hall you not now &s;top Proceedings upon the afore&s;aid Abominations, which are much more alarming?

<P>We your Petitioners pray, that your Honours will after con&s;idering this our Petition, favour us with an An&s;wer thereto, before you admit one Lawyer in, or adjourn the Court; for which, your Petitioners, as in Duty bound, &s;hall ever pray, &amp;c.</P>

Thirdly, I &s;hall now give an Account how Matters were carried on at the Court. The Evening before the Court, there was a Liberty Pole &s;et up, with a Union Flag at the Head of &s;aid Pole. Tue&s;day the 25th of July, it being the fir&s;t Day of the Court, there was no le&s;s than two or three Hundred Liberty Boys, ap|peared under &s;aid Flag, in Defiance of the Gentlemen called La&mdash;yrs; the Court being called, the Court with the Grand-Jury, were admitted peaceably to enter the Court-Hou&s;e, but no La&mdash;yrs were admitted to go in; upon which the Court made Propo&s;als to the Public, with A&s;&s;urances, that they would redre&s;s the Griev|ances of the People, as far as lay in their Power; which in &s;ome Mea&s;ure appea&s;ed the People, but could not fully con&s;ent to make Way for the Lawyers to enter the Court-Hou&s;e. Wedne&s;day the 26th Day of July in the Morning, it was again warmly in&s;i&s;ted upon, by the Court Party, that the Liberty Pole &s;hould be taken down; a Gentleman of &s;aid County, a&s;&s;erted to the People, that the Lawyers had given up the Point, and would not &s;eek for an Opportunity to enter the Court; upon which in Obedience to the Court, the Pole was taken down, and all Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ters appeared quiet; but when the Liberty Boys were in a Manner all di&s;per&s;ed, the Court was called; the Judges coming to the Hou&s;e, in|termixed with the Lawyers, gave &s;ome few of the Liberty Boys Rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect, that the A&s;&s;ertion from the afore&s;aid Gentlemen, was not fully ob&s;erved; upon which they demanded the Rea&s;on of the Lawyers com|ing to enter the Court; but were an&s;wered with a gene|ral Attack from Judges, Sheriff, and Lawyers; who played away &s;o furiou&s;ly, that they &s;oon overcame the &s;mall Number that oppo&s;ed them; they being four to one, and &s;o Judges, Sheriff, and Lawyers entered the Court, &amp;c.</P>

<P>I think it is highly nece&s;&s;ary to ac|quaint the Public, what was the moving Cau&s;e of the Oppo&s;ition made by the Inhabi|tants of &s;aid County, again&s;t the Gentlemen called L&mdash;yrs; at our Court held in &s;aid County, on Tue&s;day the 25th July, the Inhabitants of &s;aid County, having long laboured under great Oppre&s;&s;ion, ari&s;ing from &s;ome of the afore&s;aid Men, of which, I &s;hall mention one In&s;tance, tho' many more of the like Kind might be proved; one of the &s;aid Gentlemen finding that a Shop-keeper, of &s;aid County, was indebted to a Mer|chant in New-York, the &s;aid Gentleman (tho' not wor|thy of that Character) informed the Merchant, that if he did not immediately pu&s;h for his Money, he would be very likely to lo&s;e it; upon which, the Creditor put the Debtor's Bond in the Lawyer's Charge; the Law|yer yer &s;ent to the Debtor that he had &s;uch a Bond, and that if he did not put Bonds and Accounts in his Hands &s;ufficient to di&s;charge the Debt, that he mu&s;t immedi|ately &s;ue him; upon which the Debtor put between 40 and 50 Bills of Accounts, in &s;aid Lawyer's Hands, by an Agreement, that they &s;hould not be &s;ued upon, until after the next Court; but the ungrateful Lawyer, violated the Agreement, and before the Court, granted Writs for all the above cited Bills and Accounts, and al&s;o for the Shop-keeper him&s;elf; this with many &s;uch like Practices might be prov'd.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="041951_0015_101B72F2F06071F8">
The Second Oppre&s;&s;ion ari&s;ing from the &s;aid Gentle|men, is the many unwarrantable Bills of Co&s;ts made by many of them, which was fully prov'd, at the Court afore&s;aid; the Inhabitants under the afore&s;aid Oppre&s;&s;i|ons, were determined to &s;hew the Court, their Di&s;appro|bation of &s;uch Proceedings; upon which the Court, with the Public, agreed upon amicable Terms, and all Animo&s;ities to be laid a&s;ide; but by a mi&s;under&s;tand|ing of &s;ome Per&s;ons, when the Court was called, &s;aid Per&s;ons pretended &s;till to oppo&s;e the &s;aid Lawyers, which cau&s;ed &s;ome con&s;iderable Confu&s;ion for a few Mi|nutes, but when fully under&s;tood by both Sides was al&s;o dropped for the Pre&s;ent; I mention the above Pro|ceedings of the afore&s;aid Gentlemen, and al&s;o the Pro|ceedings of the Court, to &s;hew the Creditors of the People in &s;aid County, that it was not with a De&s;ign to defraud them, but that it was much the contrary. Af|ter the above Commotions, a few Bills of Co&s;ts were laid before the Court, off of which, there were above one Hundred Pounds docked; if my Information be right, there is &s;o much &s;aved for Creditors, and I doubt not, but in the Term of a few Years, it will prove, that there will be many Thou&s;ands of Pounds &s;aved for the U&s;e of Creditors as afore&s;aid.</P>

<P><HI>GENTLEMEN, I being a Spectator at your Court, of July Term la&s;t, and there &s;eeing the great Tumults, that were made in oppo&s;ition to the Gentlemen, called Lawyers, put me to a Con&s;ideration, were the Abo|minations there &s;o much complained of, again&s;t &s;aid Law|yers, might ari&s;e from, upon which I put my&s;elf in the Way of Di&s;cour&s;e, with a worthy Gentleman, who I knew was well ver&s;ed in the Bu&s;ine&s;s of Courts, and what they were erected for, who I &s;hall introduce under the borrowed Name of</HI> Moderator.</P>

<P><HI>WHERE did our Courts of Quarter Se&s;&s;ion, fir&s;t take Ri&s;e from?</HI></P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Moderator.</SPEAKER>
<P>Our gracious Sovereign, Charles the Se|cond. having the Good of his Subjects much at Heart, he with his Council, fir&s;t granted Commi&s;&s;ions for Courts to be held throughout his Dominions, for the Safeguard of his People; &s;o that every County and Shire, &s;hould have Judges, and Courts, among them|&s;elves, to hear and redre&s;s the Grievances of his Peo|ple, to which every Subject had free Recour&s;e, and there to be heard.</P>

<P><HI>Were there any Lawyers to appear in &s;aid Courts, to open the Laws to &s;aid Judges?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Modr.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, their Judges were not deemed worthy of that Honourable Commi&s;&s;ion, until they were fully ver&s;ed in the Law, and likewi&s;e Men that were &s;o well grounded in their Principles, as not to be &s;wayed or controuled by any Solicitor what&s;oever.</P>

<P><HI>What was the Con&s;equences, if they &s;hould be &s;wayed by the Influence of a Solicitor, &s;o as to deviate from the true Intention of &s;aid Courts?</HI></P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Modr.</SPEAKER>
<P>In Honour to &s;o worthy a Commi&s;&s;ion, they were publickly made an Example of, and their Com|mi&s;&s;ions taken from them, and they never deemed worthy of bearing a Commi&s;&s;ion again, under his Ma|je&s;ty.</P>

<P>Yes. our Sovereign's Laws for holding Courts, extend as far as he has any Subjects to hold Courts, and that under the &s;ame Di&s;cipline as they are and were held in England.</P>

<SP>

<P>The Lawyers fir&s;t obtained a Licence from our Governor, to appear in the Courts, to act for the People, there to open the Complainers Cau&s;e to the Court, &s;o that the Court may have a full Apprehen&s;ion of the Complaint to them made, &s;o that they do Ju&s;tice to the Subjects.</P>

<P>Yes, they ought, but where will you bring them to Ju&s;tice, for all of them have &s;wallowed &s;o much of the unrighteous Mammon, that it is hard to find a competent Judge among them, and it is nece&s;&s;ary for the County, that they be brought before a higher Court.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Modr.</SPEAKER>
<P>Surely they ought, but I fear that there is &s;o much acce&s;&s;ary Guilt among tho&s;e that have the Power to bring them there, that they will rather puni&s;h a Do|zen common Men, who would &s;pend their Lives in a good Cau&s;e for their Country, then that there &s;hould one of tho&s;e Extortioners, be openly brought to Ju&s;tice.</P>

<P>Not one whit too hard! was it not fully prov|ed at our la&s;t Court, when the County under the hea|vy burthen of Oppre&s;&s;ion, &s;ought out the be&s;t Means to relieve them&s;elves that they conceived they could do, the Judges would not enter the Court, without they had a Train of Lawyers after them, and that the Judges were the fir&s;t Men that entered into the unhappy Com|bat, in Defence of the Lawyers; and &s;hall we expect, Ju&s;tice from &s;uch Judges, again&s;t Lawyers, that they will fight for? no rea&s;onable Man can expect it.</P>
