<HEAD>A Vi&s;ion of Hell, &amp; a Di&s;covery of &s;ome of the Con&s;ultations &amp; Devices there.</HEAD>
<P>IN the month of May in the Year 1767, in a morning after I had been &s;ome time out of bed, I was mu&s;ing upon the low &s;tate of religion, and the great progre&s;s of vice; I con&s;idered how the Devils would rejoice and triumph in the decay of piety, and in the flood of immorality that threaten|ed to deluge the world.&mdash;While I was thus mu&s;ing, I &s;ell into a &s;ort of trance, I was certainly not a &s;leep; my fancy and imagination were mo&s;t lively, and yet I retained m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> memory and rea&s;on perfectly, I &s;eemed to have a vi&s;ionary view, or clear repre&s;en|tation of hell, or the world of mi&s;erable &s;pirits My mind was &s;trangely enlarged to view and compre|hend things&mdash;Hell, &s;eemed a fire, as large as all this world, &s;urrounded with impenetrable walls: the gate was very wide and was continually open, but guarded by the &s;tronge&s;t and cruele&s;t devils: and the brighte&s;t flame of the hote&s;t fire &s;eemed to &s;tream out of the gate an amazing length: in the mid&s;t of this immen&s;e fire were innumerable devils, and mi&s;era|ble &s;ouls of Adam's race.</P>
<P>I perceived the devils came to this world and re|turned to hell often. They came here to tempt, &s;e|duce, and de&s;troy mankind. and returned to hell to con&s;ult and contrive the mo&s;t effectual methods to ruin &s;ouls. Their greate&s;t malignity was again&s;t God, and Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Their malicious de&s;ire, and cur&s;ed endeavour, was to di&s;honour God, and prevent Chri&s;t having glory among mankind. I perceived their principal de&s;ign in promoting &s;in, and bringing &s;inners to hell, was to di&s;appoint God, reflect di&s;honour on the methods of his grace, and prevent Chri&s;t's being glorified by the &s;alvation of &s;ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s. The devils were much elated with pride, and filled with boa&s;ting, that their empire in this world, was larger than Immanuel's and that they had more &s;ervants and &s;ubjects than he; and that Chri&s;t's laws and authority, were &s;o little regarded.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="042104_0003_101B8B9D64868A48">
The devils held con&s;ultation upon many &s;ubjects. I perceived they had been in deep con&s;ultation upon &s;everal methods to di&s;honour God. But they were ju&s;t entering upon a new &s;ubject, as I had this vi&s;ion of Hell. Two principal devils had then ju&s;t re|turned from this world, to the infernal pit. The one was Moloch, the other Lucifer. The devils a&s;|&s;embled to hear what &s;ucce&s;s, and to con&s;ult upon further mea&s;ures&mdash;The damned &s;ouls were in mul|titudes all around, and as oft as they plea&s;ed, might attend, and hear the debates of the devils, for there was no privacy there.</P>
<P>The con&s;ultation which they held, while I had this vi&s;ion, was concerning the Go&s;pel mini&s;try, and the &s;abbath, or Lord's day. They employed their infernal wi&s;dom in devi&s;ing how they might mo&s;t effectually defeat God's end and de&s;ign in both the&s;e.</P>
<P>I &s;hall give a faithful narrative of their con&s;ulta|tion and determinations. But to make my account the more intelligible, it may be proper <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, to give the names and characters of &s;ome of the p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">cipal devils. I &s;hall mention only &s;ome of the chief. Their names were Belzebub, Lucifer, Moloch, Apollion, Mammon, Dagon, Belial, Baal, and Ni&s;roch.</P>
<P>As to their character, 'tis to be ob&s;erved, that they have all a skill and di&s;po&s;ition to any, and all evil: but yet mo&s;t of them are peculiarly di&s;po&s;ed to promote &s;ome particular &s;in and vice, more than others. Indeed, Belzebub the chief, is &s;o &s;killed in all iniquity, and &s;o bent and di&s;po&s;ed to all that is bad, that there is no devil in hell exceeds him, in any one evil. Lucifer's peculiar character is to act as an angel of light, and induce to evil under a &s;hew or fal&s;e appearance of good. Moloch, is the devil that vehemently tempts, and urges people to all vice in an open, bold, daring manner, leading them to commit &s;in, with impudence, or without &s;hame. Apollion, is the devil of cruelty, who tempts to malice and revenge, and peculiarly delights in the mi&s;ery of mankind. Mammon, is continually tempt|ing men to covetou&s;ne&s;s, and to make this world
<PB N="4" REF="042104_0004_101B8BA011EFDF88">their trea&s;ure and delight. Dagon, is the devil of &s;loth, who tempts men to &s;loth and negligence in religion, and to &s;ink into a dead &s;ullen de&s;pair of any good. Belial, is the devil that tempts to di&s;|obedience and ob&s;tinacy; and has peculiar influence with youth, who di&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">bey their parents. Baal, is an unclean devil, and excites to the indulgence of all &s;orts of fle&s;hly lu&s;ts, and vicious appetites. Ni&s;|roch, is the devil of pride, and is continually tempt|ing and exciting to that &s;in.</P>
<P>Moloch, and Lucifer, being ju&s;t returned from this earth, as I ob&s;erved, and the devils being a&s;|&s;embled, there con&s;ultation &amp; devices were as follows.</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Moloch.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hail, ye principalities and powers: let joy run thro, the vault of hell, &s;uch joy as this horrible pit can allow; for we have great &s;ucce&s;s. Vice abounds; Jehovah is di&s;honoured; his laws are di&s;|regarded; Me&s;&s;iah is di&s;pi&s;ed; we have more &s;ubjects on earth, ye whe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e the go&s;pel is pre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ched, than he has.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belzebub.</SPEAKER>
<P>We feel the heli&s;h joy in all our hearts. But while we boa&s;t in the &s;ucce&s;s there has been, we mu&s;t employ our infernal wi&s;dom in contriving &s;omething farther again&s;t Jehovah, and his govern|ment; for I &s;hall never be ea&s;y, till he is di&s;pi&s;ed or neglected by every rational creature. We mu&s;t try by every diabolical art, to counteract the great de&s;ign of Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Apollion.</SPEAKER>
<P>We &s;hall all heartily join in what is now propo&s;ed, that we may bring millions to bla&s;pheme him in hell to all eternity, in&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d of prai&s;ing him in heaven as he propo&s;es.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belz.</SPEAKER>
<P>The preaching of the go&s;pel, is the dete&s;table means of dimini&s;hing our kingdom. We have long found by &s;ad experience, that <HI>Faith comes by bear|ing,</HI> what they call, the glad tidings of &s;alvation. I wi&s;h we could &s;ome way defeat the hell-hated de&s;ign of a preached go&s;pel, which is &s;o adapted to attract the hearts of &s;inners, and turn them from our intere&s;t.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Apollion.</SPEAKER>
<P>The in&s;titution of the &s;abbath, &amp; the exerci|&s;es of it, are al&s;o hateful means of encroaching upon us, and dimini&s;hing our &s;ubjects; I wi&s;h it was for

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belzebub.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis worthy our angelic wi&s;dom, to enter into a deep con&s;ultation at this time, upon the&s;e two points, viz. how we may fru&s;trate the de&s;ign of the preached go&s;pel, and render u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">le&s;s the &s;abbath-day.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belial.</SPEAKER>
<P>We have all had opportunity to ob&s;erve in ages pa&s;t, that the ob&s;ervance of the &s;abbath, and religion, &s;tand and fall together.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dagon.</SPEAKER>
<P>If we could by &s;loth, or any other way keep people from attending public wor&s;hip, our great end would in a good mea&s;ure be an&s;wered, as to a preach|ed go&s;pel, and the &s;abbath both. I propo&s;e there|fore that we attempt this.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belzebub.</SPEAKER>
<P>My worthy a&s;&s;ociate who &s;poke la&s;t, has propo&s;ed, &s;omething very proper in its place; but I think we ought not to depend upon that alone. Let us lay our &s;cheme deeper and larger; and try in many ways, which I am &s;ure our &s;uperior wi&s;dom can devi&s;e, to defeat the de&s;ign of preaching the go&s;pel and the &s;abbath.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lucifer</SPEAKER>
<P>Excellent propo&s;al! And let us take parti|cular care to cover our de&s;igns as much as po&s;&s;ible, &amp; give them &s;uch a colouring that mankind may think them rational. We never &s;ucceed &s;o well as when we act like angels of light. Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> is a rational crea|ture, and though fallen, has yet that dete&s;table thing they call <HI>Con&s;cience;</HI> which puts the &s;oul into a &s;trange commotion, when &s;in appears in its proper colour. I dread con&s;cience more than any thing in human na|ture, &s;ince the &s;all of man; therefore, in all we do, let us keep our de&s;ign as much as po&s;&s;ible out of &s;ight.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belial.</SPEAKER>
<P>O, Lucifer &s;on of the morning, we all perceive the wi&s;dom of thy advice. and let us attempt what Belzebub has propo&s;ed, and i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> every way po&s;&s;ible, de|feat the fatal tendency of a preached go&s;pel. For we all ob&s;erve, that from the cities, towns, and congre|gations. where the go&s;pel is clearly and faithfully di&s;pen&s;ed, there are fewer &s;ouls come to hell, than from other places. The &s;eats of glory, and felicity in heaven, from which we fell, are filled up from time to time, with human &s;ouls, that go from places where that dete&s;table go&s;pel is clearly exhibited.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mammon.</SPEAKER>
<P>We all knew the difference between the places P&mdash;l, and R&mdash;S. In one of the&s;e the go&s;pel is clearly preached, by that dete&s;table wretch K&mdash;L&mdash;In the other, how little hurt is done to us, where Z&mdash;R. pretends to preach; but his life and doctrine are &s;uch, that we lo&s;e but little by him. Let us therefore, if po&s;&s;ible, prevent a clear, faithful, &s;earching method of preaching.</P>

<SPEAKER>Belz.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think my friend, we are all agreed in the main de&s;ign. Let us now enter upon the propere&s;t means and mo&s;t artful method to accompli&s;h our purpo&s;e. And as AI fear we &s;hall never entirely &s;et a&s;ide the go&s;pel mini&s;try, I think one leading &s;top to accom|pli&s;h our purpo&s;e, is, to induce bad men to enter into the mini&s;try. If people will have preaching, let us put forward tho&s;e that will an&s;wer our own pur|po&s;e, or at m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;t do us but little hurt, &amp; by that means we &s;hall keep out tho&s;e whom we have and &s;ear.</P>

<P>My heart feels peculiar &s;atisfaction when tho&s;e who have the Character of go&s;pel mini&s;ters, are guilty of adultery, drunkenne&s;s, or other &s;candalous &s;ins: it gives a &s;ort of &s;upport and encouragement to vicious per&s;ons, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">inks the hearts of the good, and confirms <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">idels; &s;carce any thing reflects more di&s;honour upon the Son of God, &amp; di&s;grace to his plan of Salvation.</P>

<SPEAKER>Mammon.</SPEAKER>
<P>To promote our de&s;ign, I think we ought to lead all Clergymen, whether good or bad, to expect <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">y their calling) great things in this world, riche<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, honour, ea&s;e, and a &s;tate above the common level of mankind.

<P>Yes. &amp; when they are di&s;appointed, it affords a good occa&s;ion to excite a quarrel between them &amp; their people, and produce &s;uch prejudices, alienations, and breaches, as greatly help our cau&s;e.

<P>Yes. true heart of cruelty! but we have not done yet. There are further mea&s;ures to defeat that detestable &s;cheme of Jehovah, and his Mi&s;&s;i&s;h. Let us proceed.</P>

<SPEAKER>Belial.</SPEAKER>
<P>Proceed we will, my worthy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, I have &s;ome time been waiting to propo&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">

<SPEAKER>Lucifer.</SPEAKER>
<P>The&s;e fal&s;e reports have been very u&s;eful to us. But &s;uch &s;tories will be mo&s;t effectual when they have the plau&s;ible appearance of truth.

<SPEAKER>Apollion.</SPEAKER>
<P>I would add &s;omething here near a kin to what was la&s;t mentioned, viz. to magnify and add to, the real faults of mini&s;ters; make mountains of mole hills, and allow nothing for the frailties of human nature in them, but make people think that their fail|ings unfit them for their calling, and that they may lawfully &s;pread abroad their infirmities. This will pre|judice people, and &s;ink the hearts of mini&s;ters.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belzebub.</SPEAKER>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Moloch.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have this further to propo&s;e, that we &s;hould tempt and &s;tir up parents to talk again&s;t mini&s;|ters, before their children. By this the young ones will be prejudiced, and emboldened to contemn, and &s;peak &s;lightly of them; and &s;o the mini&s;try become u&s;ele&s;s to the ri&s;ing generation, and we know if people are led to undervalue and &s;light divine things till they are ad|vanced in years, there is but little danger of our lo&s;ing them afterwards.</P>

<SPEAKER>Belial.</SPEAKER>
<P>The advice of Moloch is much to the pur|po&s;e. I have often ob&s;erved the effect of it among the young ones, to my great &s;atisfaction. There is G&mdash; D&mdash;of H&mdash;l, has practi&s;ed according to the&s;e &s;ug|ge&s;tions; he repeats over with &s;atisfaction among his children, the fal&s;hoods rai&s;ed and &s;pread abroad con|cerning his mini&s;ter and intimates that he has rea&s;on to believe they are true.

<P>On the contrary; I know &s;ome of tho&s;e dete&s;table fainti&s;h &s;ort of people, who are &s;et to op|po&s;e our kingdom, who will not before their children &s;o much as whi&s;per any thing again&s;t their mini&s;ter, le&s;t the young ones &s;hould be led to &s;light him, and undervalue the advice he gives them.</P>

<P>Ay, I know &s;ome &s;queami&s;h creatures, who if they really think their mini&s;ter is wrong, will not let their children know it, lea&s;t it &s;hould prevent their getting good by his preaching. But we mu&s;t try to defeat this fainti&s;h prudence.</P>

<P>If tho&s;e oppo&s;ers of our intere&s;t &s;hould af|ter all, make bold; open, re&s;olute attempts, to defeat our de&s;ign, and oppo&s;e any practices which we have promoted among mankind. &amp; the vices &amp; vicious cu&s;|toms which we have made to prevail, &amp; we cannot per&s;ecute them in any other way; we mu&s;t ri&s;e a cla|mour and noi&s;e, make our friends talk big and high, blu&s;ter, threaten, and pretend that the&s;e mini&s;ters are going to turn the world up&s;ide down, bring in inno|vations, and &s;trange regulations and practice, to de|prive people of their proper liberties and cu&s;toms.

<P>Yes: I know many that would have been led to oppo&s;e our mea&s;ures, if &s;ome of our bold blu&s;|tering fellows had not &s;cared them.

<P>Stir up &s;ome enthu&s;ia&s;tic, deluded, &s;elf-conceited people to cen&s;ure and condemn the mini&s;|ters of Chri&s;t, as carnal unregenerate men and legal preachers. There are numbers of people who thro' the pride of their bearts, ignorance of them&s;elves, and of the nature of religion, think they are more reli|gious than others: The&s;e may be improved as u&s;e|ful &s;ervants in our cau&s;e; they pretend to great reli|gion and &s;anctity, inward light and experience, &s;o that many people really think they have much reli|gion, and under&s;tand it better than common. The&s;e pretenders mu&s;t be excited to cen&s;ure and condemn mini&s;ters as carnal, unregenerate, legal, and dull; that they have not the &s;pirit, and do not preach by experience; that if they have any grace, they have got away from God; that 'tis unprofitable if not dan|gerous to hear them, yea, that 'tis very dangerous to let awakened per&s;ons hear them.</P>

<P>That is right, thou angel of light. There is in that the appearance of religion, that will readi|ly take with many people who have really &s;ome true religion. They will hearken to the&s;e high pretenders, and thereby be prejudiced again&s;t their mini&s;ters.</P>

<SPEAKER>Lucifer.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have u&s;ed many, who are not our real friends, but the &s;ubjects of Immanuel, as in&s;truments to do us much &s;ervice by this project. They have been led to think their mini&s;ters ignorant and carnal, and cen&s;ure them as &s;uch, and then the whole weight of tho&s;e good people's influence goes again&s;t the mini&s;ter; and other people argue thus, "Surely the mi|ni&s;ter is carnal and legal, becau&s;e &s;uch an one who is undoubtedly pious, cen&s;ures him as carnal, which he would not &s;urely do if the mini&s;ter was &s;piritual."</P>

<P>I find what Lucifer ju&s;t now propo&s;ed, is one of our mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful methods, when there is a revival of religion in the world, &amp; a general concern upon the minds of mankind.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lucifer.</SPEAKER>
<P>This art and method gives me more &s;a|tisfaction, becau&s;e this way we counteract Je&s;us Chri&s;t when he &s;ends his &s;pirit to convince and awaken peo|ple. We hereby undermine and defeat a work of grace, and in the end bring great reproach upon vital religion: It prejudices many, and makes them then think there is nothing in experimental religion, but that all is delu&s;ion or hypocri&s;y; becau&s;e after a while they &s;ee the&s;e high pretenders turn out to have no re|ligion, and often prove vicious.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belial.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have one thing more to propo&s;e concer|ning the go&s;pel mini&s;try, and that is, that we by all means lead mini&s;ters to di&s;pute with, contradict, and cen&s;ure one another; yea, contend, quarrel, anathe|mati&s;e, and excommunicate one another. I think we may have great &s;ucce&s;s in this way: Some of tho&s;e contradictions will tend to unhinge people's minds, e&s;pecially the weak and ignorant; they will be led to think that as one mini&s;ter teaches one thing, and a|nother <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">other, there is no knowing what religion is, be&s;ides it keeps up parties, and illwill, and alienation among mini&s;ters and people both.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belzebub.</SPEAKER>
<P>The &s;abbath is a day that I hate; it has proved the dete&s;table means of depriving us of many thou&s;ans, if not millions of &s;ouls. We have before ob&s;erved, that religion flouri&s;hes or falls in proporti|on as the &s;abbath is ob&s;erved or not.

And I would propo&s;e in the fu&s;t place, that we &s;hould induce &s;ome of our friends on earth by &s;ophi&s;tical arguments, and under a pretence of religion, to &s;hew that there is no &s;abbath by God's appointment under the go&s;pel di&s;pen&s;ation: So that by this means people may not think them&s;elves under obligation to ob&s;erve it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lucifer.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is well propo&s;ed. If in this re&s;pect we can act as angels of light, we &s;hall &s;ucceed in the be&s;t manner; then con&s;cience will not be alarmed with &s;abbath breaking, and I dread con&s;cience above any thing on earth. We have tho&s;e friends among men, &s;ome thro' mi&s;take, and &s;ome thro' de&s;ign, who under a pretence or notion of go&s;pel freedom, pro|claim them&s;elves free from the obligations of the &s;abbath. We mu&s;t influence them to in&s;i&s;t upon this freedom, and under a notion of being very &s;piritual, and holy at all times, reject the &s;abbath as a legal thing, tending to &s;piritual bondage and &s;uper&s;tition.</P>

<P>We have another &s;et of friends the R-g- ns, who be&s;tir them&s;elves with more zeal in our cau&s;e, both again&s;t the mini&s;try and the &s;abbath. We mu&s;t by all means promote and in&s;tigate this &s;et of men: They do much wherever they come, to interrupt people upon the &s;abbath, and prevent the proper exerci&s;es of that day: They will make much oppo|&s;ition, noi&s;e and clamour about the &s;abbath; and will from time to time draw &s;ome to their way of thinking, e&s;pecially the children brought up in their families, will re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ain their parent's notions; and if we gain no more than this by it, we &s;hould exert our &s;elves to promote this &s;ect to the utmo&s;t.</P>

<SP>

<P>I approve of brother Belial's opinion. But if we could lead the&s;e R-g-reens to be a little more &s;ubtil and plau&s;ible, they would do us more &s;ervice, for they have acted &s;o zealou&s;ly for us, that they have in many things gone &s;o contrary to rea&s;on and com|mon &s;en&s;e, that they prevent their doing us &s;o much &s;ervice as otherways they might.</P>

<SPEAKER>Belzebub.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have another thing to propo&s;e re&s;pect|ing the &s;abbath, that is, that we try to keep up as many different &s;entiments about it as we can. This will cau&s;e divi&s;ions, di&s;putes, and confu&s;ion. If peo|ple will have a &s;abbath, let us try to make them dif|fer about the day; &s;ome hold 'tis one day of the week, and others another; and as much as po&s;&s;ible be very confident in their &s;entiments, and cen&s;ure &amp; condemn one another. Where there is much di&s;|pute and contradiction it keeps people's minds un|&s;ettled, and leads &s;ome more carele&s;s ones to think, there is not much in the &s;abbath.</P>

<P>There are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ther temptations which if urged artfully will do much &s;ervice; particularly, that we have &s;everal &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rts of m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n to &s;ettle their accounts and adju&s;t their &s;ecular bu&s;ine&s;s on the &s;abbath.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belzebub.</SPEAKER>
<P>That propo&s;al ought to be attended to.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mammon.</SPEAKER>
<P>This may be done by degrees. We may at fir&s;t make them think &s;omething of this is nece&s;&s;a|ry. And when they once begin, the &s;ame nece&s;&s;ity will lead them to it again and again, till they will not be afraid nor a&s;hamed to make a con&s;tant practice of it: Thus not only lawyers, phy&s;icians, and mer|chants, but many others will &s;pend the day in &s;ettling and adju&s;ting their accounts, and preparing for more publick bu&s;ine&s;s on other days of the week.</P>

<SPEAKER>Baal.</SPEAKER>
<P>I would propo&s;e, that Mammon &s;hould tempt people in the country to walk over their fields and plantations on that day, and view their crops, creatures, fences, and the like. This will be more a|greeable to many than attending public wor&s;hip: And if any &s;hould fault them for not attending the word preached, they can ea&s;ily excu&s;e them&s;elves, by &s;aying, they can read as good a &s;ermon at home as they can hear at church.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Moloch.</SPEAKER>
<P>We mu&s;t by all means promote and in|crea&s;e a practice, which to the joy of my heart, I find we have already had con&s;iderable &s;ucce&s;s in: A prac|tice which I hope to make make very prevalent; I mean going into company, drinking, gaming, and whoring upon the &s;abbath.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Baal.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have prevailed with many, to prefer this day for vi&s;iting their mi&s;tre&s;&s;es and pro&s;ecuting lewd|ne&s;s: And I think I &s;hall in &s;ome places &s;oon make it a principal time for drinking and gaming.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Apollion.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis mo&s;t agreeable to have men &s;pend this day in vain company, drinking, gaming, whor|ing, and &s;uch like practices; becau&s;e they are then not only guilty of the&s;e vices in them&s;elves, but have the additional guilt of &s;abbath braking, and neglect of publick wor&s;hip. &s;o that Jehovah is peculiarly di&s;|honoured, his laws trampled upon, and his go&s;pel di&s;pi&s;ed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lucifer.</SPEAKER>
<P>What cau&s;e have we to rejoice, O ye principalities and powers, that by our wi&s;dom and influence. we can &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully defeat Jehovah and his Son; that we can bring to mere nothing the go&s;|pel mini&s;try and the &s;abbath, and fill the&s;e horrid re|gions with thou&s;ands and millions of Me&s;&s;iah's kin|dred in the &s;lo&s;h, who&s;e cur&s;es and bla&s;phemies are mu&s;ic in our ears Their hearts and tongues are not employed in prai&s;ing Jehovah, and his Chri&s;t, but in accu&s;ing and bla&s;pheming, and &s;hall be &s;o to all eter|nity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belzebub.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thy joy: O Lucifer, is worthy the noble powers of hell. But we have not done with the &s;ab|bath. After all, many will pay &s;ome regard to the day, and attend public wor&s;hip: It remains that we
<PB N="20" REF="042104_0020_101B8BCAE7C76150">con&s;ider how we &s;hall prevent their getting any good on that day.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dagon.</SPEAKER>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, I will, &s;ugge&s;t to them that as the &s;abbath is a day of re&s;t, they may lie in bed late that morning, &amp; indulge their ca&s;e, &s;o that by this means they &s;hall have little or no time for read|ing or praying; &s;carce have time to dre&s;s, in order to &s;hew them&s;elves at church, and after all, be &s;o late that &s;ervice &s;hall be great part over, before they arrive.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ni&s;roch.</SPEAKER>
<P>We mu&s;t by all means induce them to employ their tho'ts and &s;pend much time in dre&s;&s;ing, decking, and adorning them&s;elves. There is L&mdash;. G. and G&mdash;. B. and a thou&s;and others, who &s;carce think of any thing on &s;abbath morning, except of dre&s;&s;ing, and contriving to appear to advantage in public. This is a noble perver&s;ion of the &s;abbath, and con|tradiction of what Me&s;&s;iah requires of them.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Apollion.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nothing I hate wor&s;e, than to &s;ee &s;ome fainti&s;h oppo&s;ers of our kingdom, &s;pend the &s;abbath morning in reading, meditation, and praying for a ble&s;&s;ing on the word to be preached.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ni&s;roch.</SPEAKER>
<P>By what we have propo&s;ed about dre&s;s, &s;everal ends are an&s;wered, as,
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. It prevents reading, hearing, and prayer.</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. It leads them to idolize them&s;elves.</ITEM>
<ITEM>III. It fits them to take the attention of others at church.</ITEM>
<ITEM>IV. It fills them with vanity, and offends their maker, that they are not likely to get much good by preaching.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Moloch.</SPEAKER>
<P>Another thing which we ought by all means to attempt, is, to influence per&s;ons to vain and &s;imple di&s;cour&s;e in going to, and from the hou&s;e of God, and between exerci&s;es of public wor&s;hip. Some my be tempted to talk upon, and contrive frolicks; &s;ome tell &s;tories; &s;ome talk of their farms, oxen, hor&s;es, and the like; &s;ome of their merchandize, and other bu&s;ine&s;s in life, and even innumerable other &s;ubjects.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Apollion.</SPEAKER>
<P>The mind being engaged about tho&s;e things in going to church, will dwell upon them in time of &s;ervice, &s;o as to neglect any attention to the
<PB N="21" REF="042104_0021_101B8BCFDC417988">truths delivered; and we know that no good is got by any preaching that is not attended to.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Baal.</SPEAKER>
<P>May we not to our advantage induce young per&s;ons of different &s;exes, to walk, or fit together, laugh and play, and thus &s;pend the &s;abbath. This is contrary to the holy de&s;ign of the day, and &s;o fills the mind with fin and vanity, and there is not much danger that the con&s;ciences of &s;uch per&s;ons will be &s;truck with any truths of the word preached.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mammon.</SPEAKER>
<P>Some people may be induced to make their a&s;&s;embling on the &s;abbath a &s;ea&s;on to tran&s;act their worldly bu&s;ine&s;s: e&s;pecially they who live di&s;|tant in the country. There is D&mdash;. Q&mdash;. harne&s;&s;es his carriage, takes a &s;on or two, and &s;ometimes a neighbour, and with cheerful chat pa&s;&s;es eight or ten miles to church. There he meets per&s;ons with whom he can do many errands, and tran&s;act much bu&s;ine&s;s. By the opportunity of &s;eeing a number of per&s;ons, he does more wordly bu&s;ine&s;s that day than he could any other way. He attends church two or three hours, and thinks he is a good Chri&s;tian, without knowing what Chri&s;tianity i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">. We mu&s;t try to increa&s;e this practice: This is &s;o contrary to Je|hovah's command of not thinking their own tho'ts, nor finding their own plea&s;ures on his day, that he is provoked to leave them to greater hardne&s;s or wickedne&s;s.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lucifer.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is agreeable advice; I would add this further here, viz That after public wor&s;hip, people who think they dare not allow them&s;elves in vice, &s;hould be induced to vi&s;it friends and neighbours, be cheerful and talk upon common affairs. This will wonderfully help to bani&s;h from the mind any truths that might have &s;ome entrance in the time of hearing. It will al&s;o prevent their looking into the b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ble, or other books, or attending to any private exerci&s;e of wor&s;h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">p, that God requires upon the &s;ab|bath. Many will make the&s;e vi&s;its without &s;cruple of conference, who would be afraid and a&s;hamed to go in to profane company.</P>

<SPEAKER>Belzebub.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have heard your propo&s;als with great
<PB N="22" REF="042104_0022_101B5DEDDA753568">&s;atisfaction; but &s;till &s;omething remains. In the very time of hearing, when the word is preached and inculcated by our enemies, then is the great danger. Mankind have ears to hear, and they are rational creatures; there are &s;uch awakening and affecting truths delivered: Truths that in &s;uch an awful and intere&s;ting manner concern them, that it &s;eems al|mo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible that rational creatures &s;hould be care|le&s;s, and not attend, and be affected; we cannon our|&s;elves but wonder that they are not. Let us there|fore, by all means in the very time of hearing, u&s;e all our art, and throw into their minds, without cea|&s;ing, all &s;orts of evil thoughts, mo&s;t &s;uited to their corrupt nature. If we can &s;hield and &s;ecure the con|&s;cience in the time of hearing, we &s;hall not have much rea&s;on to fear.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Dagon.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can engage for &s;ome. The &s;ermon &s;hall not proceed five minutes, before they &s;hall begin to nod, or lay down their heads and &s;leep &s;ecure; and it &s;hall then be the &s;ame to them, whether the truth's deliver|ed be awakening or not.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Apollion.</SPEAKER>
<P>And let it be thought an affront, or at lea&s;t an unmannerly or impertinent thing, for any to jog or wake a neighbour in this ca&s;e. Many are more a|fraid of offending by awakening others, than of let|ting them come to hell by &s;leeping.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Ni&s;roch.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can engage for numbers. If they &s;leep not, they &s;hall think as little what the preacher &s;ays as if they did. Some &s;hall be fully engaged in viewing the dre&s;s and habits of others: New clothes, &amp; new fa&s;hions will employ their thoughts; others &s;hall think of them&s;elves and their own dre&s;s and finery, and how others view and admire them; others &s;hall be diverted by a roving eye and mind, attending to every thing to be &s;een and heard, except what the preacher &s;ays.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Baal.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can engage for &s;ome, who having hearts and eyes of adulters, &s;hall view the objects of their lu&s;ts, and have no remor&s;e at letting their hearts run freely upon their &s;in even in the hou&s;e of God.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Mammon.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can do much with &s;ome others, by &s;ug|ge&s;ting
<PB N="23" REF="042104_0023_101B8BD41B2EC168">worldly covetous thoughts, &s;o that their hearts &s;hall be far enough from the place they are in, or any thing that the preacher &s;ays.</P>

<SPEAKER>Belzebub.</SPEAKER>
<P>How few will be left to &s;erve Jehovah! Rejoice ye princes of hell. How di&s;appointed &s;hall Me&s;&s;iah be I He and his mini&s;ters may go on to com|plain that they labour in vain, and &s;pend their &s;trength for naught; while we labour with abundant &s;ucce&s;s, we reap a plentiful harve&s;t, &s;ouls flock to hell in mul|titudes: Jehovah's hateful name, his laws, his day, and in&s;titutions are and &s;hall be &s;lighted, profaned &amp; trampled upon.&mdash;Ye noble powers of hell, is not our con&s;ultation now ended? Let us &s;et out our &s;everal ways; walk up and down in the earth, and exert our&s;elves to the utmo&s;t.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Damned Souls.</SPEAKER>
<P>What fools were we! And what fools are others now on earth! to give way to the &s;ugge&s;tions of devils, and the lu&s;ts of our hearts; e&s;pecially when we knew better, and were often warned, and had con|&s;cience to check us!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Belzebub.</SPEAKER>
<P>Fools ye were, and we cannot but won|der at your folly and madne&s;s, when ye had heaven in view, rea&s;on and con&s;cience to a&s;&s;i&s;t you, many in|vitations and motives to influence. We cannot but wonder at the folly of mankind: But &s;ince there are &s;uch fools, by whom we can di&s;honour God, we re|joice, &amp; will u&s;e their folly and wickedne&s;s to de&s;troy them&s;elves and di&s;honour Me&s;&s;iah.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Damned Souls.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! what multitudes of &s;ouls will now come to hell to increa&s;e our torment. Our partners in &s;in, whom we lately left, will &s;oon be here to add <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o our mi&s;ery. Oh, cur&s;ed cruel devils thus to ruin and tor|ment us. Oh, how do we wi&s;h we could e&s;cape hence, if it was but one hour to give notice, to &s;inners on earth, of the many devices of devils, that the poor &s;ouls might not come to this place of torment.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Apollion.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hah, but you are confined &s;afe enough: We have you here, and her<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> we will torment you for ever. Not one of you &s;hall depart a moment, to
<PB N="24" REF="042104_0024_101B8BD7DF803580">give the lea&s;t whi&s;per in the ears of any mortal on earth&mdash;When your companions come hither they &s;hall know and feel what you now do.</P>
</SP>
<P>Ju&s;t at this moment my vi&s;ion vani&s;hed; my trance cea&s;ed; I returned to my&s;elf, and found all had been but a vi&s;ion. Yet &s;ure I was it was a real vi&s;ion, and the views I had were real truths.</P>
<P>And now th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> vi&s;ion I publi&s;h, hoping it may be a warning and do &s;ome good. I know the devils will &s;pite me for it: Becau&s;e I have given notice and warning to poor &s;inners: have let them &s;ee their danger, what &s;nares are laid for them, and in what ways they are like to go to hell. Devil's will hate me for di&s;covering their de&s;igns and and plots; but I fear them not, while I tru&s;t in God. They cannot go beyond their chain: And, oh, that poor &s;inners on earth would &s;hun the Devil's &s;nares, and tru&s;t in God! they would &s;urely find his help and a&s;&s;i&s;tance. If they would re&s;i&s;t the Devil, he would be made to fly from them. Je&s;us Chri&s;t is &s;tronger than Satan, and they that tru&s;t in him &s;hall overcome the evil one.</P>
<P>If I &s;hould hereafter be favoured with any &s;uch like vi&s;ion or di&s;covery of any other of the Devil's de&s;igns, I might probably think it my duty to acquaint the world with it; e&s;pecially if I find mankind make a good u&s;e of what is here offered.</P>
