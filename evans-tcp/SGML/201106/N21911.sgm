<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><HI>I</HI> HAVE &s;een in your paper of this date an ab&s;tract of the Treaty between the United States and Great-Britain, which, though not perfectly correct is nearly &s;o.</P>
<P>As this pablication will probably excite a new&s;paper di&s;cu&s;|&s;ion, it is of importance that the people &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s a full and accurate knowledge of the &s;ubject to which their attention may be drawn, and which I think has already been improperly with|held from them. Le&s;t therefore, the Treaty &s;hould be pre&s;umed more favorable, or be repre&s;ented to be le&s;s &s;o than it really is, I &s;end you herewith a genuine copy, which you may correct your &s;tatement by, or make &s;uch other u&s;e of as you plea&s;e, for the pur|po&s;e of giving to the citizens of America full information re|&s;pecting this momentous bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>

<L>'Tis true that all the time the &s;enate &s;ate,</L>

The old man found him&s;elf in difficulty; and knew no better way to get out than to evade the conver&s;ation. Accordingly, he told the gentleman, that it had given him great pain that they &s;hould differ in &s;entiment&mdash;that in con&s;equence of that pain, he had often prayed to heaven, that if he was wrong, he might be led to think like the gentle|man&mdash;or if the gentleman was wrong, that he might be led to think like Mr. Robin&s;on&mdash;for he could not bear to think different|ly from &s;uch a &s;en&s;ible man, even if that man was wrong in his opinions.&mdash;</NOTE> tried to help him&s;elf by prayer;</L>
