<P>THE Editor flatters him&s;elf that this ab&s;tract of the <HI>Hi&s;tory</HI> of <HI>Ame|rica,</HI> will not be unworthy the ac|ceptance and patronage of his fellow-citizens. The importance of having our children taught &s;o u&s;eful a branch of knowledge, is too obvious to need his feeble recommendation: for 'twill be univer&s;ally acknowledged, that the mind takes a turn in future life, &s;uitable to the tincture it hath re|ceived in youth; I will naturally conclude, that there is not a nece&s;&s;ity to regard, or at lea&s;t to lay any &s;tre&s;s

<P>Conceiving it therefore a matter of great importance to each individual as an inhabitant of any country, that he or &s;he hath a knowledge of the hi&s;tory thereof; and being well per|&s;uaded, that the following is well adapted to the youthful mind, hath excited the pre&s;ent attempt.</P>

<HEAD>THE HISTORY OF AMERICA.</HEAD>
<P>AMERICA, the we&s;tern conti|nent, is &s;ituated between 35 and 145 degrees of we&s;tern longitude, and between 80 north, and 58 &s;outh lati|tude: bounded by the lands and &s;eas about the Artic pole on the north; by the Atlantic ocean on the ea&s;t; by the va&s;t Southern ocean on the &s;outh; and by the Pacific ocean which divides it
<PB N="9" REF="028831_0004_0FDE28B6B5262F98">
from A&s;ia, on the we&s;t. Its comput|ed length, from north to &s;outh, is nine thou&s;and miles, and three thou&s;and miles in breadth.</P>
<P>It is not an improbable conjecture to &s;uppo&s;e this country was fir&s;t peo|pled by the Carthtganians, who were &s;ituate on the north-we&s;t coa&s;t of Afri|ca, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;everal i&s;lands in the Atlantic ocean, where they frequently &s;ent thou&s;ands of men, women, and chil|dren. It is certainly natural to expect that &s;ome of their &s;hips, which were very large, might mi&s;s tho&s;e i&s;lands, and be driven to the we&s;t, beyond their intend|ed port; and if this ever happened, they mu&s;t have been carried to America, which is but three weeks &s;ail from the Canary or Cape de Verd i&s;lands, from whence it was impo&s;&s;ible they &s;hould return to the Ea&s;tern continent, as the trade winds always &s;et again&s;t them, and the u&s;e of the compa&s;s was not known in tho&s;e early ages. Thus this exten|&s;ive

country, and its valuable produc|tions remained unknown to the more enlightened parts of the world, until Chri&s;topher Columbus, a native of Ge|noa, &s;ugge&s;ted the idea that there was another continent beyond the Atlan|tic ocean. But however &s;anguine Co|lumbus might be in his expectations, it appears that his propo&s;als for carrying his bold &s;chemes into execution was treated with cool indifference by the different courts he applied to: and it was not until the expiration of &s;everal years clo&s;e application, that he was to proceed on his voyage. At length the court of Spain began to li&s;ten more favourably to the propo&s;ed undertaking, and Columbus was commi&s;&s;ioned to equip three &s;hips with the title of admiral of the we&s;tern &s;eas: with the&s;e &s;hips he &s;et &s;ail from Palos in Andalu&s;ia the 3d of Augu&s;t A. D. 1492, and arrived at the Canary i&s;lands on the 12th; from thence he &s;ail|ed, September 1&s;t, to the we&s;tward, but

his men began to mutiny, before they had been out fourteen days, imagin|ing he was leading them to certain de|&s;truction; he notwith&s;tanding per&s;uad|ed them to continue the voyage until the 16th, at which time they were con|&s;ulting to throw their admiral overboard and return to their own country, but he had the good fortune at ten o'clock the &s;ame night to &s;ee a light on &s;hore, and the next day made land which proved to be one of the Bahama i&s;lands: from thence he &s;ailed to Cuba and Hi&s;paniola, and from thence back to Europe, having performed his voyage to the new world and back again in &s;even months and eleven days, and was received by the court of Spain with all the honours due to a man that had found out another continent; yet how un&s;table is the fa|vour of princes: this de&s;erving man af|ter bringing &s;uch a large acqui&s;ition to the crown of Spain as a&s;toni&s;hed Eu|rope, was &s;uperceded in his government

AMERICUS VESPUTIUS, a Floren|tine, was &s;ent by the court of Spain to make further di&s;coveries, A. D. 1497; and having made the Canaries, &s;ailed from thence &s;outh-we&s;t 1000 leagues, and arrived at the Carribe i&s;lands in 16 degrees north latitude, and continuing his cour&s;e 900 leagues further, we&s;t, arrived at a country under the tropic of cancer, &s;uppo&s;ed to be &s;ome part of Mex|ico.

After him there were &s;everal other adventuri&s;ts employ|ed by the different courts of Europe; as Seba&s;tian Cabbot, of Italian extraction, who was employed by Henry the &s;eventh of England, to find out a north-we&s;t pa&s;&s;age to China, he departed from En|gland, 1498, and &s;ailed along the north-ea&s;t coa&s;t of America to 67 degrees north latitude, but failed in his attempt. The Engli&s;h, neverthele&s;s, were benefitted by the voyage as they claimed a large tract of country in con&s;equence of the di&s;coveries made by Cabbot, and was called Briti&s;h America, which was di|vided into colonies: of the&s;e we &s;hall treat &s;eparately, under the title of the United Independent States of North America.</P>

NEW-ENGLAND.</HEAD>
<P>NEW-ENGLAND is bounded by Ca|nada on the north, by the Atlantic ocean and Nova-Scotia on the ea&s;t and &s;outh, and by New York on the we&s;t. It is divided into four governments or &s;tates, viz. New Hamp&s;hire, Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts Rhode-I&s;land and Connecticut.</P>
<P>The land next the &s;ea in New Eng|land is generally low, but farther up the country it ri&s;es into hills, and on the north-ea&s;t it is rocky and mountaneous. The north-we&s;t wind blowing over a long tract of frozen country makes the winters exce&s;&s;ive cold; the climate in general healthful and agreeable to Eu|ropean con&s;titutions. Fruit comes to great perfection, particularly peaches, it is not very uncommon to find &s;even or eight hundred peaches on one tree, and &s;even barrels of cyder has been made from one apple tree.</P>

The &s;permaceti whale, and other whales are found on the coa&s;t, of which the New-England people take great numbers. This country was fir&s;t &s;ettled from En|gland. In the year 1619, &s;ome zea|lous di&s;&s;enters of the independent per|&s;ua&s;ion, unea&s;y at being required to conform to the church of England, pur|cha&s;es what was called the Plymouth patent, and obtained another from king James; a number of adventurers, to the amount of 150, embarked in a &s;hip, at Plymouth, which &s;ailed the 6th of Sep|tember, A. D. 1620, and arrived at Cape Cod in New-England, the ninth of November following, where they built a town and called it New Plymouth; and Mr. John Carver was elected their fir&s;t governor. The Indians at this time were &s;o engaged in wars among&s;t them|&s;elves

that the&s;e &s;trangers were &s;uffered to remain pretty quiet, and they having learned from one Quanto, an Indian, who had been to England, what a powerful people the Engli&s;h were. This induced many of the &s;achems the following &s;pring to &s;eek an alliance with them, profe&s;&s;ing them&s;elves &s;ubjects to the crown of En|gland. More &s;hips arriving with plan|ters and provi&s;ions, a colony &s;oon became e&s;tabli&s;hed, but differences ari&s;ing on account of religion had like to have been of fatal con&s;equence. The indepen|dents, who were the mo&s;t numerous, re|fu&s;ing to tolerate any other &s;ect or per|&s;ua&s;ion but their own. Several of the adventurers removed to other parts of the country and others returned home; thus the colony became &s;o weakened that had it not been for the civil war that kept the Indians employed, they would in all probability have been dri|ven out of the country.</P>

who in 1614, built a fort on the we&s;t &s;ide. Captain Argal, returning from an expedition again&s;t the French, on the bay of Funday; commi&s;&s;ioned by &s;ir Thomas Dale, governor of Virginia, paid a vi&s;it to the Dutch on Hud&s;on ri|ver, who, unable to re&s;i&s;t him, prudently &s;ubmitted for the pre&s;ent to the king of England, and under him to the gover|nor of Virginia; but the next year they built a fort on the &s;outh-we&s;t &s;ide of the i&s;land then called Manhattans, now York I&s;land. In 1621, the &s;tates ge|neral determined upon the &s;ettlement of the country, made a grant of it to their We&s;t India company. Wouter Van Twiller arrived at fort Am&s;terdam, now New-York, and took upon him|&s;elf the government, in June, 1621, his &s;tyle in the patents granted by him was thus, "We director and council re&s;id|ing in New Netherlands, under the go|vernment of their high mightine&s;&s;es, the lords &s;tates general of the Uunited Ne+therlands,

The city of New-York is built on an i&s;land, called by the Indians Manhattans: the i&s;land is very narrow, not a mile wide at a medium, and about fourteen miles in length; the South-we&s;t point pro|jects into a fine &s;pacious bay and opens the ocean to full view. The pa&s;&s;age up to New-York from Sandy-Hook is &s;afe, and not above twenty-five miles in length. The city has in reality no na|tural ba&s;on or harbour.

STATE OF NEW-JERSEY.</HEAD>
<P>NEW-JERSY, ea&s;t and we&s;t, were formerly proprietary governments, but the proprietors as the country became more populous grew weary of govern|ing, and di&s;putes often ari&s;ing between their governors and the people, agreed to &s;urrender their power, unto queen Anne, A. D. 1702. Lord Cornbury, &s;on to the great earl of Clarendon, was immediately appointed governor, who&s;e behaviour was &s;o arbitrary, mean and trifling, as drew upon him the hatred of the people: It was not uncommon for him to dre&s;s him&s;elf in a woman's habit and then patrole the fort in which he re|&s;ided. Such freaks of low humour ex|po&s;ed him to the univer&s;al contempt of the people, and their indignation was kindled by his di&s;potic rules, &s;avage bigotry, in&s;atiable avarice, and inju&s;tice, not only to the public but even his pri|vate creditors; for he left &s;ome of his

When the conduct of &s;uch a man is contra&s;ted with the mild admini&s;tration of the pre&s;ent governor, who unites the great qualities of the &s;tate&s;man with the more amiable and endearing virtues of humanity, how it degrades the former, and enhances the virtues of the latter, and dignifies that pre-eminence he hath obtained by his me|rit, and the united approbation of his fellow citizens.

It has a low level coa&s;t, not a hill to be &s;een from St. Au|gu&s;tine to Virginia: the country ri&s;es in|to hills about one hundred miles we&s;t of the coa&s;t; and continues to ri&s;e gradual|ly, to the Appalachian mountains, which are about one hundred and fifty miles from the ocean. They &s;hip off from South-Carolina, yearly, large quantities of rice, deer &s;kins, pitch and tar, to a con&s;iderable amount. Their tar is e&s;|teemed in Europe as good as the Nor|way tar: their chief trade for &s;kins and furs, is with the Creeks and Cherokee Indians. This &s;tate &s;uffered much in the time of the late war, when lord Cornwallis, the mo&s;t enterprizing of|ficer in the Briti&s;h army, reduced the

<P>THIS &s;tate was included with South-Carolina and Georgia in one grant, and was a proprietary govern|ment; but by the di&s;agreement of the parties concerned became &s;ubject to the crown.

It often lurks by the &s;ide of a bank near the river, and there patient|ly waits for &s;ome land animal, coming to drink, be it a man, tyger, bull or dog; it &s;eizes the victim with a &s;pring, and having &s;ecured his prey with teeth and claws, he &s;inks with it to the bot|tom of the river, and it is &s;oon drowned. The tyger, as &s;oon as he is &s;eized by this enemy, immediately turns with great agility and forces his claws in his eyes, while he is plunged by his fierce antagoni&s;t into the water, where he is &s;oon de&s;troyed.

THE LIFE OF GENERAL MONTGOMERY.</HEAD>
<P>GENERAL MONTGOMERY de|&s;cended from a re&s;pectable fami|ly in the North of Ireland, and was born in the year 1737. His attachment to li|bery was innate, and matured by a fine education and an excellent under&s;tand|ing. Having married, and purcha&s;ed an e&s;tate in New-York, he was, from
<PB N="82" REF="028831_0041_0FDE297BB721EFF8">
the&s;e circum&s;tances, as well as from his natural love of freedom, and from a con|viction of the ju&s;tne&s;s of her cau&s;e indu|ced to con&s;ider him&s;elf as an American. From principle, he early embarked in her cau&s;e, and quitted the &s;weets of ea&s;y fortune, the enjoyment of a loved and philo&s;ophical rural life, with the highe&s;t dome&s;tic felicity, to take an active &s;hare in all the hard&s;hips and dangers that at|tend the &s;oldier's life.</P>
<P>Before he came over to America, he had been an officer in the &s;ervice of En|gland, and had &s;ucce&s;sfully fought her battles with the immortal Wolfe at Que|bec, in the war of 1756, on the very &s;pot, where when fighting under the &s;tandard of freedom, he was doomed to fall in arms again&s;t her. No one who fell a martyr to freedom in this unnatu|ral conte&s;t, was more &s;incerely, or more univer&s;ally lamented. And what is ex|traordinary, the mo&s;t eminent &s;peakers in the Briti&s;h parliament, forgetting for
<PB N="83" REF="028831_0041_0FDE297BB721EFF8">
the moment, that he had died in oppo|&s;ing their cruel and oppre&s;&s;ive mea&s;ures, di&s;played all their eloquence in prai&s;ing his virtues and lamenting his fate. A great orator, and a veteran fellow &s;ol|dier of his in the French war of 1756, &s;hed abundance of tears, while he expa|tiated on their pa&s;t friend&s;hip and mutu|al exchange of tender &s;ervices in that &s;ea&s;on of enterpri&s;e and glory.</P>
<P>All enmity to this veteran &s;oldier ex|pired with his life; and re&s;pect to his private character prevailed over all other con&s;iderations. By the orders of Gene|ral Carlton, his remains received eve|ry po&s;&s;ible mark of di&s;tinction from the victors, and was interred in Quebec, on the fir&s;t day of January, 1776, with all the honours due to a brave &s;oldier.</P>

SKETCH OF THE LIFE OF THE LATE NATHANIEL GREENE, Major General of the Forces of the United States of America.</HEAD>
<P>THIS gallant officer, who&s;e death is &s;o generally and &s;o ju&s;tly regret|ted, was born in the town of Warwick, Kent county, Rhode-I&s;land, in or about the year 1741, and was the &s;econd &s;on of a re&s;pectable citizen of the &s;ame name (de&s;cended from &s;ome of the fir&s;t &s;ettlers in the colony,) who was exten&s;ively concerned in lucrative iron-works, the property of which, at his death, (prior to the war) he left to his children.</P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="028831_0046_0FDE299AC3FFC9D8">The &s;ubject of this &s;ketch was en|dowed with an uncommon degree of judgement and penetration, which with a benevolent manner and affable beha|viour, acquired him a number of valua|ble friends, by who&s;e intere&s;t and influ|ence, he was, at an early period of life, cho&s;en a member of the a&s;&s;embly of the then colony of Rhode-I&s;land. This tru&s;t, in which he gave the highe&s;t &s;a|tisfaction to his con&s;tituents; he continu|ed to po&s;&s;e&s;s until, and at the period, when the folly and madne&s;s of England &s;evered a world from her empire.</P>
<P>After the &s;kirmi&s;hes at Lexington and Concord, when a &s;pirit of re&s;i&s;tance &s;pread like wild fire over the continent, Rhode-I&s;land was not deficient in her contributions for the general defence: &s;he rai&s;ed three regiments of militia, the command whereof was given to Mr. Greene, who was nominated brigadier-general. The liberty, &s;afety, and pro&s;|perity of his country being expo&s;ed to
<PB N="93" REF="028831_0046_0FDE299AC3FFC9D8">
imminent danger, the pacific principles of Quakeri&s;m, in which he had been educated, proved in&s;ufficient to combat the ardent &s;pirit of liberty with which his bo&s;om glowed.</P>
<P>He led the troops under his command to Cambridge, and was pre&s;ent at the evacuation of Bo&s;ton, by a force which had in England been vauntingly &s;tated treble the number that would be requi|&s;ite to dragoon America into uncondi|tional &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>General Greene's merit and abilities, as well in council as in the field, were not long unnoticed by Gen. Wa&s;hing|ton, who repo&s;ed in him the utmo&s;t con|fidence, and paid particular deference to his advice and opinion on all occca&s;ions of doubt and difficulty. This excited the jealou&s;y of &s;everal officers of older date and higher rank, who were not wanting in endeavours to &s;upplant him: but in vain&mdash;the commander in chief knew, and prized his worth as it de&s;erv|ed.</P>
<P><PB N="94" REF="028831_0047_0FDE299F21071BD0">He was appointed major-general by congre&s;s, the 26th of Augu&s;t, 1776. Towards the clo&s;e of that year he was at the Trenton &s;urprize, and at the be|ginning of the next, was at the battle of Princetown, two enterprizes not more happily planned than judiciou&s;ly execut|ed, in both of which he highly di&s;tin|gui&s;hed him&s;elf, &s;erving his noviciate under the American Fabius.</P>
<P>At the battle of Germantown, he commanded the left wing of the Ame|rican army, and his utmo&s;t endeavours were excited to retreive the fortune of that day, in which his met with the ap|probation of the commander in chief.</P>
<P>In March, 1778, he was appointed quarter-ma&s;ter-general, which office he accepted under a &s;tipulation that his rank in the army &s;hould not be affected by it, and that he &s;hould retain his right to command in time of action, ac|cording to his rank and &s;eniority. This he exerci&s;ed at the battle of Monmouth,
<PB N="95" REF="028831_0047_0FDE299F21071BD0">
where he commanded the right wing of the army.</P>
<P>About the middle of the &s;ame year, an attack, in conjunction with the French fleet, on the Briti&s;h garri&s;on at Newport, Rhode-I&s;land, being planned, General Sullivan was appointed to the command, under whom Gen. Greene &s;erved. This attempt was un&s;ucces|ful: the French fleet having &s;ailed out of harbour to engage lord Howe's fleet, they were di&s;per&s;ed by a &s;torm, and the Americans were obliged to rai&s;e the &s;iege of Newport, in doing which General Greene di&s;played a great degree of &s;kill in drawing off the army in &s;afety.</P>
<P>After the hopes of the Briti&s;h Gene|rals, to execute &s;ome deci&s;ive &s;troke to the northward, were fru&s;trated, they turned their attention to the &s;outhern &s;tates, as le&s;s capable of defence, and more likely to reward the invaders with ample plunder. A grand expidition was
<PB N="96" REF="028831_0048_0FDE29A613795230">
in con&s;equence, planned at New-York, where the army embarked on or about the 26th day of December, 1779, and landed on the 11th of February, 1780, within thirty miles of Charle&s;ton, which, after a brave defence, was &s;urrendered to &s;ir Henry Clinton, on the twelfth of May.</P>
<P>A &s;eries of ill &s;ucce&s;s followed this unfortunate event: the American arms in South Carolina were in general un|&s;ucce&s;sful, and the inhabitants were obliged to &s;ubmit to the invaders, who&s;e impolitic &s;everity was extremely ill calculated to an&s;wer any of the objects for which the war had been commenced.</P>
<P>Affairs were thus circum&s;tanced, when General Wa&s;hington appointed General Greene to the command of the American forces in the &s;outhern di&s;trict. He arrived at Charlotte, on the &s;econd day of December, 1780, accompanied by General Morgan, a brave officer, who had di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf to the
<PB N="97" REF="028831_0048_0FDE29A613795230">
northward, in the expidetion again&s;t Burgoyne. He found the forces he was to command reduced to a very &s;mall number by defeat and by de&s;ertion. The returns were nine hundred and &s;eventy continentals and one thou&s;and and thir|teen militia; military &s;tores, provi&s;ions, forages and all things nece&s;&s;ary, were if po&s;&s;ible in a more reduced &s;tate than his army. His men were without pay and almo&s;t without cloathing, and &s;up|plies of the latter were not to be had but from a di&s;tance of two hundred miles. In this perilous &s;ituation, he had to op|po&s;e a re&s;pectable and victorious army. Fortunately for him, the conduct of &s;ome of the friends of royalty obliged numbers, otherwi&s;e di&s;po&s;ed, to remain neuter, or take up arms in their own defence. This and the prudent mea&s;ures the general took for removing the innumerable dif|ficulties and di&s;advantages he was &s;ur|rounded with, and for conciliating the affections of the inhabitants, &s;oon brought

together a con&s;iderable force, far inferi|or, however, to that of the Briti&s;h, who e&s;teemed the country perfectly &s;ubjugat|ed.</P>
<P>The happy period at length arrived, when by virtue and bravery of her &s;ons, aided by the bounty of heaven, America compelled her invaders to recognize her independence. Then her armies quitted the tented fields, and retired to cultivate the arts of peace and happine&s;s. Among&s;t the re&s;t, General Greene revi&s;ited his native country, where he proved him&s;elf as valuable a citizen, as the Carolinas had witne&s;&s;ed him a gallant officer. Di&s;&s;en&s;ions and jealou&s;ies had extended their de&s;tructive influence among the Rhode-I&s;landers, and their animo&s;ity had ari&s;en to &s;uch a degree, as to threaten the mo&s;t &s;erious ill con&s;equences: Ge|neral Greene exerted him&s;elf to re&s;tore harmony and peace among&s;t them once more, and was happily &s;ucce&s;sful.</P>
<P>In October, 1785, he &s;ailed to Geor|gia, where he had a con&s;iderable e&s;tate,
<PB N="99" REF="028831_0049_0FDE29AC8A7D3228">
not far di&s;tant from Savanah: here he pa&s;&s;ed away his time, occupied in his dome&s;tic concerns, until the hour of his mortality approached. Walking out one day in June la&s;t, we are told, he was overpowered by the extreme heat of the &s;un, which brought on a di&s;order, that carried him off a few days after, on the 19th of the &s;ame month.</P>
<P>When the melancholy account of his death was arrived at Savannah, the peo|ple were &s;truck with the deepe&s;t &s;orrow.</P>

A SKETCH OF THE LIFE OF ISRAEL PUTNAM, SENIOR MAJOR GENERAL IN THE ARMY OF THE UNITED STATES.</HEAD>
<P>ISRAEL PUTNAM, who, through a regular gradation of promotion be|came the Senior Major General in the army of the United States, and next in rank to General Wa&s;hington, was born at Salem, in the province, now &s;tate of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, on the 7th day of January, 1718. His father, captain Jo&s;eph Putnam, was the &s;on of Mr.
<PB N="104" REF="028831_0052_0FDD1D8E9507A2F0">
John Putnam, who, with two brothers, came from the &s;outh of England, and were among the fir&s;t &s;ettlers of Salem.</P>
<P>When we thus behold a per&s;on, from the humble walks of life, &s;tarting un|noticed in the career of fame, and by an undeviating progre&s;s through a life of honour, arriving at the highe&s;t dignity in the &s;tate; curio&s;ity is &s;trongly excit|ed, and philo&s;ophy loves to trace the path of glory from the cradle of ob&s;curi|ty to the &s;ummit of elevation.</P>
<P>His di&s;po&s;ition was as frank and gene|rous as his mind was fearle&s;s and inde|pendent. He di&s;gui&s;ed nothing; indeed he &s;eemed incapable of di&s;gui&s;e. Per|haps, in the intercour&s;e he was ultimate|ly obliged to have with an artful world, his &s;incerity on &s;ome occa&s;ions, outwent his di&s;cretion. Although he had too much mildne&s;s in his nature to com|mence a quarrel, he had too much &s;en|&s;ibility not to feel, and too much ho|nour not to re&s;ent an intended in&s;ult.
<PB N="105" REF="028831_0052_0FDD1D8E9507A2F0">
The fir&s;t time he went to Bo&s;ton, he was in&s;ulted for his ru&s;ticity by a boy of twice his &s;ize and age; after bearing his &s;arca&s;ms until his patience was worn out, he challenged, engaged and vanqui&s;hed his unmannerly antagoni&s;t, to the great diver&s;ion of a croud of &s;pec|tators. While a &s;trippling, his ambi|tion was to perform the labour of a man, and to excell in athletic diver&s;ions. In that rude, but ma&s;culine age, whenever the village youth a&s;&s;embled, on their u&s;ual occa&s;ions of fe&s;tivity; pitching the bar, running, leaping and wre&s;tling were favourite amu&s;ements. At &s;uch gymna&s;tic exerci&s;es (in which during the heroic times of ancient Greece and Rome, conque&s;t was con&s;idered as the promi&s;e of future military fame) he bore the palm from almo&s;t every ring.</P>
<P>In the year 1739, he removed from Salem to Pomfret, an inland fertile town in Connecticut, forty miles ea&s;t of Hartford: having here purcha&s;ed a con|&s;iderable
<PB N="106" REF="028831_0053_0FDD1D94A6B93540">
tract of land, he applied him|&s;elf &s;ucce&s;sfully to agriculture.</P>
<P>Mr. Putnam, before he attained the twenty-fir&s;t year of his age, married Mi&s;s Pope, daughter of Mr. John Pope, of Salem, by whom he had ten children, &s;even of whom are &s;till living. He lo&s;t the wife of his youth in 1764: &s;ometime after he married Mrs. Gardiner, widow of the late Mr. Gardiner, of Gardiner's I&s;land, by whom he had no i&s;&s;ue: &s;he died in 1777.</P>
<P>Our farmer had to encounter not on|ly the calamities occa&s;ioned by drought in &s;ummer, bla&s;t in harve&s;t, lo&s;s of cattle in winter, but the de&s;olation of his &s;heep-folds by wolves. In one night he had &s;eventy fine &s;heep and goats killed, be&s;ides many lambs and kids wounded: this havock was committed by a &s;he wolf, which, with her annual whelps had for &s;everal years infe&s;ted the vicinity. The young were commonly de&s;troyed by the vigilance of the hun|ters,
<PB N="107" REF="028831_0053_0FDD1D94A6B93540">
but the old one was too &s;agacious to come within reach of gun&s;hot: when clo&s;ely pur&s;ued &s;he would generally fly to the we&s;tern woods, and return the next winter with another litter of whelps.</P>
<P>This wolf at length, became &s;uch an intolerable nui&s;ance, that Mr. Putnam entered into a combination with five of his neighbours to hunt alternately un|til they could de&s;troy her. Two, by rotation, were to be con&s;tantly in pur|&s;uit; having lo&s;t the toes from one foot, by a &s;teel trap, &s;he made one track &s;horter than the other. By this ve&s;tige, the pur&s;uers, recognized in a light &s;now, the route of this pernicious animal. Having followed her to Con|necticut river, and found &s;he had turned back in a direct cour&s;e towards Pomfret, they immediately returned, and by ten o'clock the next morning, the blood hounds had driven her into a den, about three miles di&s;tant from the hou&s;e of
<PB N="108" REF="028831_0054_0FDD1D961281CEE8">
Mr. Putnam. The people &s;oon collect|ed with dogs, guns, &s;traw, fire, and &s;ul|pher, to attack the common enemy. With this apparatus &s;everal un&s;ucce&s;s|ful efforts were made to force her from the den. The hounds came back badly wounded and refu&s;ed to return. The &s;moke of blazing &s;traw had no effect; nor did the fumes of burnt brim&s;tone, with which the cavern was filled, com|pel her to quit the retirement. Weari|ed with &s;uch fruitle&s;s attempts (which had brought the time to ten o'clock at night) Mr. Putnam tried once more to make his dog enter, but in vain: he propo&s;ed to his negro man to go down into the cavern and &s;hoot the wolf; the negro declined the hazardous &s;ervice: then it was, that their ma&s;ter, angry at the di&s;appointment, and declaring that he was a&s;hamed to have a coward in his family, re&s;olved him&s;elf to de&s;troy the ferocious bea&s;t, lea&s;t &s;he &s;hould e&s;cape through &s;ome unknown &s;i&s;&s;ure of the
<PB N="109" REF="028831_0054_0FDD1D961281CEE8">
rock. His neighbours &s;trongly remon|&s;trated again&s;t the perilous enterprize; but he knowing, that wild animals are intimidated by fire, and having provided &s;everal &s;trips of birch-bark, the only combu&s;tible material which he could obtain, that would afford light in this deep and dark&s;ome cave, prepared for his de&s;cent. Having accordingly dive&s;ted him&s;elf of his coat and wai&s;tcoat, and having a long rope fa&s;tened round his legs by which he might be pulled back, at a concerted &s;ignal, he entered head foremo&s;t with the blazing torch in his hand.</P>
<P>The aperture of the den, on the ea&s;t &s;ide of a very high ledge of rocks, is about two feet &s;quare; from thence it de&s;cends obliquely fifteen feet, then run|ning horizontally about ten more, it a&s;|cends gradually &s;ixteen feet towards its termination. The &s;ides of this &s;ubterra|neous cavity are compo&s;ed of &s;mooth and &s;olid rocks, which &s;eem to have been
<PB N="110" REF="028831_0055_0FDD1D97921AB848">
divided from each other by &s;ome former earthquake. The top and bottom are al|&s;o of &s;tone, and the entrance, in winter, being covered with ice, is exceedingly &s;lippery. It is in no place high enough for a man to rai&s;e him&s;elf upright; nor in any part more than three feet in width.</P>
<P>Having groped his pa&s;&s;age to the ho|rizontal part of the den, the mo&s;t terri|fying darkne&s;s appeared in front of the dim circle of light afforded by his torch. It was &s;ilent as the hou&s;e of death: none but mon&s;ters of the de&s;ert had ever before explored this &s;olitary man|&s;ion of horror. He, cautiou&s;ly proceed|ing onward, came to the a&s;cent, which he &s;lowly mounted on his hands and knees, until he di&s;covered the glaring eye-balls of the wolf, who was &s;itting at the extremity of the cavern. Start|led at the &s;ight of fire, &s;he gna&s;hed her teeth and gave a &s;ullen growl. As &s;oon as he made the nece&s;&s;ary di&s;covery, he kicked the rope as a &s;ignal for pulling
<PB N="111" REF="028831_0055_0FDD1D97921AB848">
him out. The people at the mouth of the den, who had li&s;tened with painful anxiety, hearing the growling of the wolf, and &s;uppo&s;ing their friend to be in imminent danger, drew him forth with &s;uch celerity that his &s;hirt was &s;tripped over his head, and his &s;kin &s;everely lace|trated. After he had adju&s;ted his cloaths and loaded his gun with nine buck-&s;hot, holding a torch in one hand and the mu&s;|ket in the other, he de&s;cended the &s;econd time, when, he drew nearer than before, the wolf a&s;&s;uming a &s;till more fierce and terrible appearance, howling, rolling her eyes, &s;napping her teeth, and dropping her head between her legs, was evident|ly in the attitude and on the point of &s;pringing at him. At the critical in&s;tant, he levelled and fired at her head: &s;tun|ned with the &s;hock, and &s;uffocated with the &s;moke, he immediately found him|&s;elf drawn out of the cave; but having refre&s;hed him&s;elf, and permitted the &s;moke to di&s;&s;ipate, he went down the
<PB N="112" REF="028831_0056_0FDD1D992BA0BF38">
third time; once more he came within &s;ight of the wolf, who appearing very pa&s;&s;ive he applied the torch to her no&s;e and perceiving her dead, he took hold of her ears, and then kicking the rope, (&s;till tied round his legs) the people above, with no &s;mall exultation dragged them both out together.</P>
<P>But the time had now arrived which was to turn the in&s;truments of hu&s;band|ry into weapons of ho&s;tility, and to ex|change the hunting of wolves, who had ravaged the &s;heep-folds, for the pur&s;uit after &s;avages who had de&s;olated the frontiers. Mr. Putnam was about thir|ty-&s;even years old, when the war be|tween England and France, which pre|ceeded the la&s;t, broke out in America. His reputation mu&s;t have been favoura|bly known to the government, &s;ince the fir&s;t troops that were levied by Con|necticut. In 1755, he was appointed to the command of a company in Lyman's regiment of provincials: the regiment
<PB N="113" REF="028831_0056_0FDD1D992BA0BF38">
joined the army, at the opening of the campaign, not far di&s;tant from Crown|point. The time for which the colonial troops were to &s;erve, terminated with the campaign. Putnam was re-appoint|ed, and again took the field in 1756.</P>
<P>The active &s;ervices of captain Put|nam, on every occa&s;ion, attracted the admiration of the public, and induced the legi&s;lature of Connecticut to pro|mote him to a majority in 1757.</P>
<P>In the month of Augu&s;t, five hun|dred men were employed under the or|ders of majors Rogers and Putnam, to watch the motions of the enemy near Ticonderoga. Upon being, &s;ometime afterwards, di&s;covered, they concerted mea&s;ures for returning to fort Edward: at the moment of moving, the famous French partizan, Molang, who had been &s;ent with five hundred men to in|tercept our party, was not more than one mile and an half di&s;tant from them; having heard the firing, he ha&s;ted to lay
<PB N="114" REF="028831_0057_0FDD1DB184904DF0">
an ambu&s;cade preci&s;ely in that part of the wood mo&s;t favourable to his project. Major Putnam was ju&s;t emerging from the thicke&s;t, into the common fore&s;t, when the enemy ro&s;e, and with di&s;cor|dant yells and whoops, commenced an attack upon the right of his divi&s;ion. Surprized, but undi&s;mayed, Putnam ha&s;tily returned the fire, and perceiving it would be impracticable to cro&s;s the creek, determined to maintain his ground: in&s;pired by his example, the officers and men behaved with great bravery: &s;ometimes they fought aggre|gately in open view, and &s;ometimes in|dividually under cover; taking aim from behind the bodies of trees, and acting in a manner independent of each other; for him&s;elf having di&s;charged his fu&s;il &s;e|veral times, at length it mi&s;&s;ed fire, while the muzzle was pre&s;&s;ed again&s;t the brea&s;t of a large well proportioned Savage. This warrior, availing him|&s;elf of the indefen&s;ible attitude of his ad|ver&s;ary,
<PB N="115" REF="028831_0057_0FDD1DB184904DF0">
with a tremendous war-hoop &s;prang forward, with his lifted hatchet, and compelled him to &s;urrender; and having di&s;armed and bound him fa&s;t to a tree, returned to the battle.</P>
<P>The intrepid captains, D'Ell and Harman, who now commanded, were forced to give ground for a little di&s;tance, the Savages, conceiving this to be the certain harbinger of victory, ru&s;hed im|petuou&s;ly on, with dreadful and redoubl|ed cries: but our two partizans, col|lecting a handful of brave men, gave the pur&s;uers &s;o warm a reception as to oblige them, in turn to retreat a little beyond the &s;pot where the action fir&s;t commenced: here they made a &s;tand. This change of ground, occa&s;ioned the tree to which Putnam was tied to be directly between the fire of the two par|ties. Human imagination can hardly figure to it&s;elf a more deplorable &s;itua|tion. The balls flew ince&s;&s;antly from either &s;ide, many &s;truck the tree, while
<PB N="116" REF="028831_0058_0FDD1DB2965A7538">
&s;ome pa&s;&s;ed through the &s;leeves and &s;kirts of his coat. In this &s;tate of jeo|pardy, unable to move his body, to &s;tir his limbs, or even to recline his head, he remained more than an hour: &s;o equally ballanced, and &s;o ob&s;tinate the fight. At one moment, while the battle &s;erved in favour of the enemy, a young &s;avage, cho&s;e an odd way of di&s;covering his hu|mor: he found Putnam bound: he might have di&s;patched him at a blow: but he loved better to excite the terrors of the pri&s;oner, by hurling a tomahawk at his head; or rather it &s;hould &s;eem his object was to &s;ee how near he could throw it without touching him; the weapon &s;truck in the tree a number of times at a hairs breadth di&s;tance from the mark. When the Indian had fini&s;hed his amu&s;ement, a French ba&s;-officer (a much more inveterate &s;avage by nature, though de&s;cended from &s;o humane and poli&s;hed a nation) perceiving Putnam, came up to him, and levelling a fu&s;il
<PB N="117" REF="028831_0058_0FDD1DB2965A7538">
within a foot of his brea&s;t, attempted to di&s;charge it; it mi&s;&s;ed fire. Ineffectual|ly did the intended victim, &s;olicit the treatment due to his &s;ituation, by re|peating that he was a pri&s;oner of war. The degenerate Frenchman did not un|der&s;tand the language of honour or na|ture&punc; deaf to their voice, and dead to &s;en&s;ibility, he violently and repeatedly, pu&s;hed the muzzle of his gun again&s;t Putnam's ribs, and finally gave him a cruel blow on the cheek with the butt of his piece: after this da&s;tardly deed he left him.</P>
<P>At length the active intrepedity of D'Ell and Harman, &s;econded by the per&s;evering valour of their followers, pre|vailed; they drove from the field the enemy, who left about ninety dead be|hind them. As they were retiring Put|nam was untied by the Indian who had made him pri&s;oner, and whom he after|wards called ma&s;ter. Having been con|ducted for &s;ome di&s;tance from the place
<PB N="118" REF="028831_0059_0FDD1DB412D05478">
of action, he was &s;tripped of his coat, ve&s;t, &s;tockings and &s;hoes, and loaded with as many of the packs of the woun|ded as could be piled upon him: &s;trong|ly pinioned, and his wri&s;ts tied as clo&s;ely together as they could be pulled with a cord. After he had marched, through no plea&s;ant paths, in this painful man|ner, many miles, the party (who were much fatigued) halted to re&s;t. His hands were now immoderately &s;welled from the tightne&s;s of the ligature; and the pain had become intolerable. His feet were &s;o much &s;cratched that the blood dropped fa&s;t from them. Exhau&s;ted with bearing a burden above his &s;trength, and frantick with torment, exqui&s;ite be|yond endurance; he entreated the Iri&s;h interpreter to implore, as the la&s;t and only grace he de&s;ired of the &s;avages, that they would knock him on the head and take his &s;calp at once, or loo&s;e his hands. A French officer in&s;tantly interpo&s;ing, ordered his hands to be unbound and &s;ome of the packs to be taken off.</P>
<P><PB N="119" REF="028831_0059_0FDD1DB412D05478">By this time, the Indian who cap|tured him, and had been ab&s;ent with the wounded, coming up, gave him a pair of moca&s;ons, and expre&s;&s;ed great indignation at the unworthy treatment his pri&s;oner had &s;uffered.</P>
<P>The &s;avage cheif again returned to the care of the wounded, and the Indians, about two hundred in number, went be|fore the re&s;t of the party to the place where the whole were, that night, to en|camp. They took with them Major Putnam, on whom (be&s;ides innumera|ble other outrages) they had the barba|rity to inflict a deep wound with a to|mahawk, in the left cheek. His &s;uf|ferings were in this place con&s;ummated. A &s;cene of horror, infinitely greater than had ever met his eyes before, was now preparing: it was determined to roa&s;t him alive. For this purpo&s;e, they led him into a dark fore&s;t, &s;tripped him nak|ed bound him to a tree, and piled dry bru&s;h with other fuel, at a &s;mall di&s;+tance,
<PB N="120" REF="028831_0060_0FDD1DB59102B0C8">
in a circle round him. They accompanied their labours, as if for his funeral dirge, with &s;creams and &s;ounds inimitable but by &s;avage voices: then they &s;et the piles on fire; a &s;udden &s;hower damped the ri&s;ing flame. Still they &s;trove to kindle it, until, at la&s;t, the blaze ran fiercely round the circle: Ma|jor Putnam &s;oon began to feel the &s;corching heat. His hands were &s;o tied that he could move his body. He oft|en &s;hifted &s;ides as the fire approached. This &s;ight, at the very idea of which, all but &s;avages, mu&s;t &s;hudder, afforded the highe&s;t diver&s;ion to his inhuman tormen|tors; who demon&s;trated the delirium of their joy by corre&s;pondent yells, dances and ge&s;ticulations. He &s;aw clearly that his final hour was inevitably come: he &s;ummoned all his re&s;olution and com|po&s;ed his mind, as far as his circum|&s;tances would admit, to bid an eternal farewell to all he held mo&s;t dear. To quit the world would &s;carcely have co&s;t

him a &s;ingle pang; but for the idea of home, but for the remembrance of do|me&s;tic endearments, of the affectionate partner of his &s;oul, and their beloved of|&s;pring. His thoughts was ultimately fixed on a happier &s;tate of exi&s;tence, be|yond the tortures he was beginning to endure. The bitterne&s;s of death, even of that death which is accompanied with the keene&s;t agonies, was in a manner pa&s;t; nature, with a feeble &s;truggle, was quitting its la&s;t hold on &s;ublunary things; when a French officer ru&s;hed through the crowd, opened away by &s;cat|tering the burning brands, and unbound the victim. It was Molang him&s;elf, to whom a &s;avage, unwilling to &s;ee another human &s;acrifice immolated, had ran and communicated the tidings. That com|mandant &s;purned and &s;everely repri|manded the barbarians, who&s;e noctur|nal powers and helli&s;h orgies he &s;udden|ly ended. Putnam did not want for feel|ing or gratitude.

<P>The &s;avage approached his pri&s;oner kindly and &s;eemed to treat him with particular affection, but being deter|mined, however, not to lo&s;e his captive he took the moca&s;ons, from his feet and tied them to one of his wri&s;ts; then di|recting him to lie down on his back on the bare ground, he &s;tretched one arm to its full length, and bound it fa&s;t to a young tree; the other arm was extend|ed and bound in the &s;ame manner: his legs were &s;tretched apart and fa&s;tened to two &s;aplings, then a number of tall but &s;lender poles were cut down; which with &s;ome long bu&s;hes, were laid acro&s;s his body, from head to foot: on each &s;ide lay as many Indians as could con|veniently find lodging, in order to pre|vent the po&s;&s;ibility of his e&s;cape. In this di&s;agreeable and painful po&s;ture he re|mained until morning. During this

night, the longe&s;t and mo&s;t dreary con|ceivable, our hero u&s;ed to relate that he felt a ray of cheerfulne&s;s come ca&s;ually acro&s;s his mind, and could not even re|frain from &s;miling when he reflected on this ludicrous groupe for a painter, of which he him&s;elf was the principal fi|gure.</P>
<P>At night, the party arrived at Ticon|deroga, and the pri&s;oner was placed un|der a &s;trong French guard. After hav|ing been examined by the marquis de Montcalm, Major Putnam was con|ducted to Montreal by a French officer, who treated him with the greate&s;t in|dulgence and humanity.</P>
<P>To mention the dangers and difficul|ties that this brave officer underwent both before and after he was taken cap|tive by the &s;avages, is beyond my li|mits, &s;uffice it to &s;ay, that at the expi|ration of ten years from his fir&s;t receiv|ing a commi&s;&s;ion, after having &s;een as much &s;ervice, endured as many had&s;hips,
<PB N="124" REF="028831_0062_0FDD5CAB2CD829E0">
encountered as many dangers, and ac|quired as many laurels as any officer of his rank, with great &s;atisfaction laid a&s;ide his uniform and returned to his plough, which occupation he followed until the fatal day arrived, when ho&s;ti|lities commenced between Great Britain and her colonies, now the United States of America. As he happened to be oft|en at Bo&s;ton, he held many conver&s;a|tions on the&s;e &s;ubjects with General Gage, the Briti&s;h commander in cheif, lord Peircy, colonel Sheriff, colonel Small, and many officers with whom he had formerly &s;erved, who were now at the head quarters. Being often que&s;|tioned&mdash;in ca&s;e the di&s;pute &s;hould pro|ceed to ho&s;tilities, what part he would take, he always an&s;wered, with his coun|try, and, that let whatever might hap|pen, he was prepared to abide the con|&s;equence. Being interrogated,&mdash;whe|ther he, who had been a witne&s;s to the prowe&s;s and victories of the Briti&s;h fleets
<PB N="125" REF="028831_0062_0FDD5CAB2CD829E0">
and armies, did not think them equal to the conque&s;t of a country which was not the owner of a &s;ingle &s;hip, regiment or magazine. He rejoined, that he could only &s;ay, ju&s;tice would be on our &s;ide, and the event with Providence; but that he had calculated, if it required &s;ix years for the combined forces of Eng|land and her colonies to conquer &s;uch a feeble country as Canada, it would at lea&s;t, take a very long time for England alone to overcome her own widely ex|tended colonies, which were much &s;trong|er than Canada: that when men fought for every thing dear, what they believed to be the mo&s;t &s;acred of all cau&s;es, and in their own native land, they would have great advantages over their ene|mies, who were not in the &s;ame &s;itua|tion; and that, having taken into view all circum&s;tances, for his own part, he fully believed that America would not be &s;o ea&s;ily conquered by England as tho&s;e gentlemen &s;eemed to expect. Be|ing

once, in particular, a&s;ked whether he did not &s;eriou&s;ly believe that a well ap|pointed Briti&s;h army of five thou&s;and veterans could march through the whole continent of America? He replied bri&s;k|ly, no doubt, if they behaved civilly and paid well for every thing they wanted, but, after a moments pau&s;e, added&mdash;if they &s;hould attempt it in a ho&s;tile man|ner (though the American men were out of the que&s;tion) the women with their ladles and broom &s;ticks, would knock them all on the head before they had got half way through. This was the tenor of the&s;e amicable interviews.</P>
<P>Thus our hero on hearing of the com|mencement of ho&s;tilities at Lexington (who was ploughing when he heard the news) he left his plough in the middle of the field: unyoked his team, and with|out waiting to change his clothes, &s;et off for the theatre of action, and &s;o continu|ed to act in defence of his country until thea yer 1779, at which time he was ta|ken

with an unu&s;ual torpor in his right hand and foot, which gradually increa&s;|ed upon him, until it deprived him of the u&s;e of his limbs on that &s;ide, and which terminated the carreer of his &s;ervces. He died the 29th September, 1790.</P>
