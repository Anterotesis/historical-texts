<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>_AS I meant to take the &s;horte&s;t cut I could, to expo&s;e the Folly and Ab|&s;urdity of that dete&s;table doctrine, which a&s;&s;erts, that <HI>God creates Sin,</HI> I have not gone the tedious round of attending to, and an&s;wering in a formal manner, all the fallaci|ous arguments which have been advanced, and all the texts of &s;cripture which have been mi&s;applied, in order to &s;upport and uphold it. For be&s;ides a needle&s;s wa&s;te of time, that me|thod would be paying too much honour and re&s;pect to that vile and hateful novelty which, I think, ought to be treated as Mo&s;es treat|ed the Calf which Aaron and the children of I&s;rael made for them&s;elves to wor&s;hip in the wilderne&s;s. And the Scriptures inform us how he dealt with it, viz. <HI>With a laudable zeal and indignation, Mo&s;es took the Calf and burnt it in the fire, and then ground it to pow|der, and &s;trewed it on the water, and made the authors drink of it, however di&s;agreeable to their palate it might be.</HI> And this, I think, is all the apology I need make, for the method I have taken in the following performance.</P>

<HEAD>Old Divinity preferable to modern Novelty. In a LETTER, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>YOU doubtle&s;s remember, that in a late conver|&s;ation you told me that you could not &s;ee but that Mr. Hopkins had proved that &s;in is a created exi&s;tence, as really as any thing el&s;e which does exi&s;t: and that it mu&s;t be &s;o, unle&s;s we hold that a &s;inner has a power to act independent upon God; which mu&s;t be very ab&s;urd to &s;uppo&s;e.</P>
<P>But, my friend, in that conver&s;ation I di&s;covered that you were going &s;o rapidly down the torrent, that friend&s;hip induces me to offer you &s;ome further thoughts on the &s;ubject: and I do it without delay, le&s;t before this arrives, you are plunged in the gulph of error pa&s;t all recovery.</P>
<P>Remember this, that when a propo&s;ition is laid down, which is fal&s;e in its own nature, it is not all the &s;eeming proof in the world that can be offered, will ever make it true; and tho&s;e who undertake it, will have a hard and difficult ta&s;k, and be found in a circum&s;tance &s;omewhat &s;imilar to a man I once read of who undertook &s;o &s;trenuou&s;ly to prove the heathen to be chri&s;tians, that in the i&s;&s;ue it was &s;aid, that he proved him&s;elf to be a heathen. A man
<PB N="5" REF="028849_0003_0FDE24F6136E9048">
who undertakes to prove one error to be a truth, will in truth prove him&s;elf to be guilty of two, if not ten, before he has done.</P>
<P>But as I have not had opportunity to read Mr. Hopkins's &s;y&s;tem, I don't pretend to know preci&s;ely what he has wrote on the &s;ubject; but the general nature of what the advocates for this novelty ad|vance, or can advance, I have heard often enough, and I think the whole may be confuted in the lump: being all but a lump of folly and non&s;en&s;e, to &s;up|po&s;e that &s;in is a thing created.</P>
<P>I would not have you, my friend, take this letter to be a reply to Mr. Hopkins, any more than to others who imbibe the &s;ame &s;entiment, as I find many do, who of late are ready to boa&s;t, and even to triumph, that they have &s;uch a champion and bold advocate for the doctrine as they &s;ay Mr. Hop|kins is. Tho&s;e who have read him, and like his &s;entiments well on this point, &s;ay that he don't keep hid, or act the cowardly part at all; as they own Mr. We&s;t did, when &s;ome years ago he wrote on the &s;ubject.</P>
<P>Doubtle&s;s you remember, Sir, that &s;ome years ago I publi&s;hed a little piece, entitled, <HI>Old Divinity preferable to Modern Novelty.</HI> And one of tho&s;e novelties which I then oppo&s;ed, was this whim&s;ical notion which a&s;&s;erts, that God creates Sin: And I &s;uppo&s;ed I &s;aid enough then, to convince any one who will be governed by Scripture and rea&s;on, that &s;in is not a created exi&s;tence. However, I did not &s;ay every thing then that might have been &s;aid, to evince the folly of that idle whim; Therefore, I &s;hall add a few things further now. And,</P>
<P N="1">1. If we allow that &s;in is a created exi&s;tence, it
<PB N="6" REF="028849_0004_0FDE24F7DCF4E720">
overthrows the doctrine of Adam's fall; and it is never worth while for us to tell any more about it. His fall was no more than any other man's fall, who &s;ins; as we may &s;ee by and by.</P>
<P>According to Old Divinity, there was real truth, and much propriety, in &s;peaking of Adam's fall as &s;omething awfully great and dreadful: For Adam was made originally in the moral image of God, holy and upright, and put under a divine con&s;titu|tion, holy, ju&s;t and good, called the covenant of works; which &s;ecured life to him and his po&s;terity, upon conditions infinitely rea&s;onable and right; but by and according to which, one &s;in forfeited every favour and ble&s;&s;ing: And Adam being left to the freedom of his own will, fell from the &s;tate wherein he was created by &s;inning again&s;t God. And as Adam's holine&s;s, his original righteou&s;ne&s;s, or the moral image of God, in which he was created, was the greate&s;t favour given him by creation; much greater than his own exi&s;tence would or could have been without it, it being ab&s;olutely e&s;&s;ential to his happine&s;s: Therefore, by eating the forbidden fruit, Adam forfeited this, as well as every other favour; and as God was plea&s;ed to take the forfeit|ure at his hands in this re&s;pect, &s;o Adam died &s;piri|tually; and his race are born de&s;titute of original righteou&s;ne&s;s in con&s;equence of that &s;in: So there|by both Adam and his race became mortal; for in Adam all die, &s;o by the di&s;obedience of one man judgment came upon all men to condemnation. O how &s;ad, awful and dreadful, was the fall of Adam indeed!</P>
<P>But I find that the advocates for this novelty which a&s;&s;erts that God creates &s;in, &s;ay that &s;piritual
<PB N="7" REF="028849_0004_0FDE24F7DCF4E720">
death was no part of the penalty with which Adam was threatened, in ca&s;e he &s;hould eat the forbidden fruit: But to an&s;wer wi&s;e ends and purpo&s;es, they &s;ay, God took away Adam's holine&s;s in a way of &s;overeignty, and by his divine power created the radical &s;um of all moral evil, in him, and by his po&s;itive agency produces all the evil volitions that Adam ever exerci&s;ed, or any of his race, from that day to this, or ever will exerci&s;e to the end of the world: And without this, they &s;ay, that neither Adam, nor any of his race, could ever have &s;inned at all. So that according to them, Adam did not fall by &s;inning; for he was down before ever he was guilty of any tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion. He did not fall from the e&s;tate wherein he was fir&s;t created by &s;in|ning again&s;t God: For according to them, God had took him out of the e&s;tate wherein he was fir&s;t created, and put him into another &s;tate infinitely wor&s;e, before he &s;inned. So that Adam was no more to blame for the lo&s;s of his holine&s;s, than an innocent man is to blame for being robbed of a &s;um of money. He met with a great calamity, but was guilty of no crime.</P>
<P>When God created Adam holy, he exerci&s;ed ho|line&s;s: When God took away that holine&s;s, and created &s;in in him, he exerci&s;ed &s;in. So that ac|cording to this novelty, Adam met with a dreadful conver&s;ion;&mdash;was converted from being a very good man, to that of a very bad one; and this effected by the mighty power of God: For Adam was as pa&s;&s;ive in this change, as good converts are in their regeneration.</P>
<P>According to genuine Calvini&s;m, a man is pa&s;&s;ive in his regeneration: That is, mankind in this fallen
<PB N="8" REF="028849_0005_0FDE24FB2A9A9DC0">
&s;tate, are con&s;idered as &s;o entirely depraved and corrupt, there is nothing &s;o good and virtuou&s;ly in|clined in them by nature, as to concur with the divine &s;pirit in producing that ble&s;&s;ed change: But when the change is wrought by divine power and grace, the man becomes active in gracious and holy exerci&s;es. So I may &s;ay, upon their plan, when this dreadful change was a going to be wrought in Adam by divine power, to make a &s;inner of him, there was nothing in his perfectly holy nature &s;o wickedly inclined, as to concur in this awful work; but infinite power was above him, and too &s;trong for him, and when it had overcome every virtuous di&s;po&s;ition, comprized in the moral image of God, and created vicious ones in him in lieu thereof,&mdash; Adam becomes active in &s;inful exerci&s;es, and &s;o a voluntary &s;inner.</P>
<P N="2">2. I ob&s;erve, that if we allow or a&s;&s;ert that &s;in is created, we mu&s;t be led to deny the true definition of &s;in, as given in our catechi&s;m, agreeable to the &s;criptures. Old Divinity a&s;&s;erts, "that &s;in is any want of conformity unto, or tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of the law of God." Now it is evident, that the A&s;&s;em|bly of Divines, which compiled the catechi&s;m, look|ed upon the law of God to be &s;o broad and &s;piritual, that it requires a right &s;tate of heart, a right tem|per of mind, as well as a life rightly conducted. That as a rule, the law enjoins what mankind &s;hould be, as well as what they &s;hould do, viz. That we &s;hould be holy both in heart and life: Therefore they &s;ay, that "&s;in is any want of conformity unto this law,"&mdash;meaning in heart, &s;pirit, temper and di&s;po&s;ition, as to the full extent of all that inward purity and holine&s;s which the law requires. And
<PB N="9" REF="028849_0005_0FDE24FB2A9A9DC0">
what can be more true than this? For if the law of God, as a good and ju&s;t rule, requires of us po&s;itive holine&s;s, in full perfection: then any want of on|formity to this law is &s;in. But the advocates for this novelty &s;ay, want of conformity to the law is <HI>not</HI> &s;in: A mere de&s;titution of holine&s;s is no &s;in. For &s;in, &s;ay they, con&s;i&s;ts in po&s;itive oppo&s;ition to God, and enmity again&s;t him. And they harp much upon this, and triumph in what they &s;ay, as &s;up|po&s;ing it to be demon&s;tration, viz. <HI>That &s;in is not a negative, but a po&s;itive: A negative is nothing; but &s;in, certainly, is &s;omething.</HI> And to prove that &s;in is not a negative, they often bring &s;imilitudes from the brutal and inanimate part of the creation, and &s;ay there is no holine&s;s in this thing, or that, and yet no &s;in; becau&s;e there is no po&s;itive oppo&s;ition to God.</P>
<P>I have often had &s;imilitudes of this nature brought to me, to prove that &s;in is not a negative, viz. Let us &s;uppo&s;e, here is a che&s;t large and capacious enough to hold a good deal of trea&s;ure; but there is no clothes in it&mdash;there is no &s;ilver nor gold in it &mdash;and there is no holine&s;s in it;&mdash;neither, &s;ay they, is there any &s;in in it; becau&s;e there is no po&s;itive enmity to God. But as &s;illy as the &s;imilitude is, if they will prove that that che&s;t always was, and now is, under moral obligations to be brim full of holi|ne&s;s, and then prove, that for that che&s;t to be wholly empty, or entirely de&s;titute of any holine&s;s, is no &s;in, the &s;imilitude would be to their purpo&s;e. But how can it be, my friend, that rational crea|tures, and tho&s;e too who profe&s;s to be &s;agacious and uncommonly di&s;cerning, will allow that we are under moral obligations to be perfectly holy, and
<PB N="10" REF="028849_0006_0FDE25010ADC8098">
then &s;ay entire de&s;titution of it is no &s;in? I &s;ay, how can this be? Why, my friend, I can tell you how it can be, and how it actually does come to pa&s;s, viz. The advocates for this novelty having pre determined that there is no &s;in but what is created: But they, with all their learning, wit and wi&s;dom, cannot make out that a want, or de&s;|titution, is creation; and therefore they have been led to this nece&s;&s;ity, to &s;ay, that want of conformity to the law of God is no &s;in.</P>
<P>I grant that there is po&s;itively &s;uch a thing as &s;in, and yet &s;in is not, properly &s;peaking, a po&s;itive. There mu&s;t be a po&s;itive, which is an original that is right, in order to furni&s;h us with a rule to know what is wrong. If there is nothing antecedently right, there can be nothing wrong; for wrong is the rever&s;e of right: Now right is a po&s;itive, an original; and wrong is the negative of that po&s;itive. Well, then, what is this po&s;itive that is right and truly original? <HI>It is holine&s;s.</HI> The holine&s;s of God is ab&s;olute perfection in him, and the foundation of all moral obligation upon his, and all rational creatures to conform thereunto, as the only right and proper &s;tandard: Therefore, when God com|mands us to be holy, he gives us the rea&s;on for it: Be ye holy, &s;aith he, for I am holy. If God were not holy, we &s;hould not be under any obligations to be holy: Neither &s;hould we have had any rule or &s;tandard of holine&s;s to conform unto. By po&s;i|tive holine&s;s, creatures conform to the rule that is right: and the want of po&s;itive holine&s;s is a devia|tion from that rule. Now, for a rational creature to be holy, is to be right; and not to be holy, is to be wrong; which is &s;in&punc; For a man to be right,
<PB N="11" REF="028849_0006_0FDE25010ADC8098">
&s;uppo&s;es he was made &s;o by creation; but to be wrong, &s;uppo&s;es he came &s;o by degeneration. To be fully right, &s;uppo&s;es holine&s;s in perfection: to be wrong, in any degree &s;uppo&s;es a defection. And for any to a&s;&s;ert, that degeneration and defec|tion is creation, is the fir&s;t born of non-&s;en&s;e: And to &s;ay that degeneration and defection is no &s;in, is no better.</P>
<P>But to remark a little upon this plea they make, &mdash;that &s;in is not a negative, becau&s;e a negative is nothing, and nothing is no &s;in: for &s;in is &s;omething. Now, on &s;uppo&s;ition that &s;uch a thing was po&s;&s;ible, that man could, and really &s;hould, do nothing for a limitted &s;pace of time, yet the law of God re|quiring him po&s;itively to do &s;omething the &s;ame &s;pace, his doing nothing would be his crime, and not his excu&s;e: For if the unprofitable &s;ervant could plead he had done no harm, yet he mu&s;t be condemned, for that he did no good; duty being &s;omething po&s;itive.</P>
<P>If one was to tell me, that he &s;uppo&s;ed that the negative of <HI>being</HI> was nothing,&mdash;non entity, or non-exi&s;tence&mdash;I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e that he was &s;incere. But when I hear men profe&s;&s;edly acquainted with language in divinity, &s;ay, that the negative of po|&s;itive holine&s;s is nothing; that is no &s;in&mdash;his ho|ne&s;ty looks &s;u&s;picious, though perhaps he may be &s;incere being &s;o &s;anguine in the belief that there is no &s;in but what God creates. As the po&s;itive and the negative are the rever&s;e of each other, there is no great difficulty in under&s;tanding what the negative is;&mdash;if we know what the po&s;itive is, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> is the rever&s;e of it.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="028849_0007_0FDE250295779330">But &s;eeing the advocates for this novelty, can't &s;ee any thing criminal in a negative, I will omit the word, and make u&s;e of &s;ome others that may an&s;wer as well: And I may &s;ay, that things in ge|neral have their oppo&s;ites; and we may learn much of the nature of things by their oppo&s;ites. Light and darkne&s;s, life and death, holine&s;s and &s;in, are the oppo&s;ites of each other: So that if a man has no light, he is in darkne&s;s; if he has no life, he is dead; if he has no holine&s;s, he has &s;in, or is a &s;inner.</P>
<P>Now let us &s;uppo&s;e there is a man this hour who has natural life, the next hour he has lo&s;t it entire|ly. The que&s;tion is, whether the man is dead? or whether there is &s;ome creation work to be wrought in order to kill him effectually. Or, we will &s;up|po&s;e, here is a man who has &s;piritual life, or holi|ne&s;s in perfection, as much as Adam had, when he was fir&s;t created; but he &s;oon loo&s;es it entirely, let him loo&s;e it how he will; either by forfeiture, or in a way of divine &s;overeignty, God takes it from him, if he has lo&s;t it: The que&s;tion is, whether he is not &s;piritually dead, in con&s;equence of that lo&s;s without the addition of a creation to kill him in this &s;en&s;e? And is not &s;piritual death a &s;tate of &s;in&punc; Where, then, is there any room for creation to make a holy man become a &s;inner?</P>
<P>The ca&s;e is very different on the other hand&punc; Let us &s;uppo&s;e here is a man &s;piritually dead,&mdash;dead in tre&s;pa&s;&s;es and &s;in; how &s;hall he be quickened and made alive &s;piritually? The &s;cripture is plain,&mdash;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> re&s;urrection power,&mdash;by creating power. And tho&s;e who are quickened with &s;piritual life, are &s;aid to be
<PB N="13" REF="028849_0007_0FDE250295779330">
ri&s;en with Chri&s;t, created anew, &amp;c. But now is a re&s;urrection power, and creating power, nece&s;|&s;ary to be exerted, in order to bring the&s;e quickned &s;ouls back again into a &s;tate of &s;piritual death? No, very far from that; for if it was not for the go&s;pel con&s;titution, and the power of God engaged to pre|vent it, &s;ouls quickned with &s;piritual life, would fall back again, of their own accord, into a &s;tate of &s;piritual death. And to prevent this from actual|ly being the ca&s;e with &s;aints, God, who has began the good work of grace in their hearts, carries it on, and they are kept by the power of God, thro' faith, unto &s;alvation.</P>
<P>Now if Adam, being left to the freedom of his own will, fell into a &s;tate of &s;piritual death, (and the &s;aints who are quickned with &s;piritual life would fall into a &s;tate of &s;piritual death al&s;o, if they were not, by the power of God, kept from it),&mdash;how fooli&s;h mu&s;t the a&s;&s;ertion be, that men can't &s;in, but by the exertion of creating power producing of it? When divine power and grace mu&s;t con&s;tantly be engaged to prevent it.</P>
<P>If the advocates for this novelty will prove that there was and is a wicked Deity who exi&s;ted of a nece&s;&s;ity of nature from all eternity, and that &s;in is e&s;&s;ential to his very nature, or e&s;&s;ence, and that all &s;in in creatures, is created by him, or that he is the great Efficient po&s;itively producing of it, then I will own that &s;in is as truely a po&s;itive and an original as holine&s;s is.</P>
<P N="3">3. If we allow, or a&s;&s;ert, that God produces &s;in by his po&s;itive agency, or that he creates it; then I remark, that &s;in is the gift of God to them who
<PB N="14" REF="028849_0008_0FDE2503FA849B28">
have it. 'As God gave me my exi&s;tence by creation, the powers and faculties of my &s;oul and body, which I am to be thankful for, and improve to his honour and glory: &s;o if God does create &s;in in me, in or|der that I may be furni&s;h'd with ability to exerci&s;e it, then it is as truely the gift of God as my exi&s;t|ence is, or any other thing he gives by creation.' And this is &s;o true and undeniable, that there is no getting from it. Let the advocates for this novelty wrangle and twi&s;t ever &s;o much, they mu&s;t come to it at la&s;t, and own that &s;in is as much the gift of God to them that have it, as faith is, or any other &s;av|ing grace, to tho&s;e who have them. Although I will freely concede if that will oblige them any, that &s;in is not &s;o good a gift as &s;ome other of the gifts of God are, yet as truely his gift.</P>
<P>Now I wi&s;h the&s;e gentlemen who a&s;&s;ert that God creates &s;in, would be &s;o kind as to tell me whether I ought to be thankful to God for this gift, and pray to God for &s;trength to improve it well, that when he has given me one talent of it I may &s;o improve it, as to gain five more. And as you, my friend, &s;eemed to be almo&s;t pro&s;elyted to the &s;entiment, I would a&s;k you what you think an holy &s;oul in the exerci&s;e of grace, who feels di&s;po&s;ed to give God thanks for all his gifts; I &s;ay, what do you think he will do, when in his thank&s;giving he comes to mention the gift of &s;in? wont he he&s;itate and bog|gle here, or what will he do?&mdash;Methinks he will expre&s;s him&s;elf in language like this following, viz. <Q>O Lord God Almighty, I feel my&s;elf overwhelm'd in debt to thee, for thy manifold favours, and have a di&s;po&s;ition, by thy grace, to give thanks to thy great name for all thy gifts of nature, pro|vidence
<PB N="15" REF="028849_0008_0FDE2503FA849B28">
and grace. I give thanks to thee, O my God, for the gift of my exi&s;tence, that thou ha&s;t given me a rational &s;oul, with all its noble pow|ers and faculties. I give thanks to thee for my bodily &s;tructure, with limbs and members &s;o per|fect and entire. I give thanks to thee, O God, for the creatures thou ha&s;t made for my u&s;e and comfort. I give thanks to thee, O Father of all mercies, and God of all grace, for the gift of thy Son to become my Saviour and Redeemer. I give thanks to thee, O God, for the gift of thy &s;pirit, to apply the great &s;alvation to my &s;oul, which Chri&s;t has purcha&s;ed. I thank thee for the gift of regenerating grace, for the gift of faith, for the gift of repentance and pardon; yea, O Lord, I give thanks to thee for the gift of eternal life, which thou ha&s;t promi&s;ed in thy word, to all them that believe. O Lord, every good and perfect gift comes from thee, and they are more than I can enumerate. What &s;hall I render to the Lord for all his benefits? But, O Lord, there are &s;ome who profe&s;s to be teachers in thy name, who tell me that thou do&s;t give &s;in to the children of men by thy creating power; mu&s;t I be thankful to thee for this gift? O no, the holy fervours of my &s;oul, under the influence of thy grace, will not admit of it; what &s;hall I do, then, in this &s;trait? &s;hall I be unthankful to thee for any of thy gifts? this I would not be; but I can't be thankful for the gift of &s;in, but mu&s;t pray that God will never cur&s;e me with &s;uch a gift. O Lord, be not angry with me, if I pray to thee in the words of Daniel to Bel&s;hazar, let thy gifts, of this nature, be to thy&s;elf, and give thy

rewards to another. O no, I cannot pray &s;o, for I love my neighbour as my&s;elf; and by thy grace prevailing in my heart; I love my enemies. Therefore, I cannot pray that God will be&s;tow that devil like gift of &s;in on the wor&s;t enemy I have in the world.</Q></P>
<P>But how do you think, my friend, that a &s;inner, who loves his &s;in, and determines to pur&s;ue the plea|&s;ures of it, as his chief happine&s;s, all the days of his life; I &s;ay, how do you think &s;uch <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> would pray, if he &s;hould &s;peak out the language of his heart, and in the full belief of this novelty that God does create &s;in?&mdash;I think we may naturally &s;uppo&s;e that the language of his heart, fram'd into words, would be as follows: <Q>O Lord God Almighty, as I am told by my teacher, and I firmly believe his doc|trine, that in thy &s;overeigty thou wa&s;t plea&s;ed to take away the holine&s;s originally given to Adam, and did&s;t create &s;in in him, in lieu thereof, and by thy po&s;itive agency did&s;t produce every evil volition in Adam he ever had, and likewi&s;e doth the &s;ame in me, and in all Adam's race, and will continue to do &s;o as long as the children of men exerci&s;e any &s;in; &s;o that in con&s;equence of my being deprav'd and corrupted, by the &s;in which thou ha&s;t created in me, and do&s;t daily produce by thy po&s;itive agency, I delight in wickedne&s;s exceedingly. I roll &s;in as a &s;weet mor&s;el under my tongue, and refu&s;e to let it go. I would not ex|change the plea&s;ures of &s;in, for the rivers of plea|&s;ure which flow at God's right hand forevermore. And if I am not truely thankful to thee, O God, for all thy gifts; yet this darling gift, &s;in, glad|dens me to the heart. And although, by thy
<PB N="17" REF="028849_0009_0FDE250920D906F0">
creating power, thou ha&s;t form'd me for the work and bu&s;ine&s;s of &s;in, and ha&s;t given me a general propen&s;ity that way&punc; yet of my&s;elf I am &s;o weak and feeble, as to works of wickedne&s;s, that I can't get &s;o much as one evil volition excited by all that I can do; no, nor by all the help the devil can afford me.&mdash;Therefore, as &s;in is my delightful element, I &s;incerely pray that God will conde|&s;cend to afford me help herein, and grant &s;uch mea&s;ures of his almighty agency, which will be effectual to produce evil violitions, in thick &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, in me, that I may be very fruitful in ways of &s;in, and abound in the works of wicked|ne&s;s, and herein equal any &s;ervant of the devil on earth. But, O Lord, if in thy divine &s;over|eignty thou art plea&s;ed to withhold tho&s;e influen|ces of thine, which are ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to produce &s;in, and I remain in a great mea&s;ure bar|ren as to fruits of wickedne&s;s; I mu&s;t &s;ubmit to the &s;ad mortification of remaining a little, poor dwarf of a &s;inner.</Q></P>
<P N="4">4. I remark upon this doctrine, which a&s;&s;erts, God doth create &s;in, or produce it by his po&s;itive agency, that no man ever did, will, or can exer|ci&s;e true genuine repentance while he has the full belief of this doctrine plain in his view, and realized before him.</P>
<P>In true repentance, a man acquits God wholly from blame, and takes freely the whole blame to him&s;elf; and if God is &s;o good, kind, and gracious as to pardon him, he don't know how to pardon him&s;elf; his &s;ins appear &s;o unrea&s;onable, and his
<PB N="18" REF="028849_0010_0FDE250A00820140">
crimes &s;o aggravated and heinous. But if I believe God created my &s;in in me, and produced it by his po&s;itive agency, and thereby made me voluntary in the exerci&s;e of &s;in; I cannot take the whole blame to my&s;elf, let my temper of mind, or di&s;po&s;ition, be ever &s;o good and holy. As on the other hand&punc; when God creates good di&s;po&s;itions, and produces gracious and holy tempers in the &s;aints, and there|by makes them voluntary in good and virtuous exer|ci&s;es, they don't take the whole prai&s;e of their own voluntary exerci&s;es to them&s;elves; for they know of right, the principal and chief prai&s;e belongs to the Great Efficient, who produced them. "Not unto us, not unto us, but to thy name, O Lord&punc; be the glory," is their united language. There|fore if a man really believes, that by the creating power of God, exerted upon him, &s;in is produced and he thereby is made a volunteer in the exerci&s;e of it, he mu&s;t counteract his rea&s;on, bribe his judg|ment, and turn fool, in order to take the whole blame to him&s;elf.</P>
<P N="5">5. If we allow, and maintain, that God creates &s;in, I remark, that it has a natural tendency to pre|judice mankind again&s;t &s;ome very important doc|trines of the Bible, more than otherwi&s;e they would be. If you tell &s;inners of the ri&s;ing generation, and in &s;ome places more e&s;pecially, that they mu&s;t be|lieve the depravity of human nature in this fallen &s;tate, that they lie wholly at the mercy of God, and that he has a &s;overeign right to have mercy on whom he will&punc; Tell them of the doctrine of &s;pecial grace, ju&s;tification by faith, the per&s;everance of the &s;aints, and &s;uch like: Then they will immediately
<PB N="19" REF="028849_0010_0FDE250A00820140">
conclude that they con&s;ent to the&s;e things, they mu&s;t go further, and believe, that God does create &s;in; becau&s;e that now-a days there are &s;o many that teach the one, teach the other al&s;o. But thirty or forty years ago there was no &s;uch doctrine held in our country, as all know who lived in that day, and paid any proper attention to divinity. All our Calvini&s;tic divines rejected the idea with abhorrence, that God created &s;in; as is well known, from the fir&s;t &s;ettling of this country, down to Pre&s;ident Edwards and Dr. Bellamy&punc; which two late and no|ted divines, bore an ample te&s;timony again&s;t this vile and pernicious novelty &s;o much imbibed of late; which in the clo&s;e of this letter I &s;hall cite their own words to &s;hew.</P>
<P>But of late, that there are many who have art|fully tried to connect this novelty with the doctrines of grace, cannot be denied, and have prejudiced people again&s;t the truth abundantly. The ri&s;ing generation often &s;ay,&mdash; <Q>What! will God forbid &s;in, and then create it him&s;elf? will he produce it in men by his own po&s;itive agency, and then damn them for it? If you call this one of the doc|trines of grace we will quit them; we don't think that there is any thing wor&s;e, if &s;o bad, in Ar|miniani&s;m, Dei&s;m, nor Univer&s;ali&s;m.</Q> And hence many fly to tho&s;e &s;ectaries for refuge, to &s;hun this vile and abominable doctrine. And the advo|cates for this novelty are eventually driving the country fa&s;t into Dei&s;m, and Univer&s;ali&s;m.</P>
<P N="6">6. If we allow that God creates &s;in, and produ|ces it by his own po&s;itive agency: then I remark, that Mo&s;es, and Paul, and other writers of the
<PB N="20" REF="028849_0011_0FDE250B8CBDE2F8">
&s;criptures, have manife&s;tly &s;landered the devil, by laying that to his charge that he never was guilty of: for if God created &s;in our fir&s;t parents, and in their whole ace, and produces, by his po&s;itive agency, all the evil volitions and exerci&s;es they ev|er have, (as this novelty a&s;&s;erts,) then mankind would have &s;inned, and continue to &s;in, ju&s;t as they did, and do, if there had been no devil in the uni|ver&s;e. And what is it, then, laid to the devil for, that he is the cau&s;e of mens &s;inning?</P>
<P>When Mo&s;es undertook to give us an hi&s;torical account of the &s;in of our fir&s;t parents, in eating the forbidden fruit, he don't &s;o much as hint, that God created their &s;in, or produced it by his own po&s;itive agency. But by divine permi&s;&s;ion, the devil, by &s;ubtilty and craft, deceit and lies, really deceived Eve, and effected the fall of our fir&s;t parents. And Paul &s;ays, "I fear le&s;t by any means, that as the &s;erpent beguiled Eve thro' his &s;ubtilty, &s;o your minds &s;hould be corrupted,' &amp;c. And another writer of &s;cripture &s;ays, after the &s;op &s;atan entered into Judas, and then he was ready, and &s;ought op|portunity to betray his Lord. And Peter &s;ays to Ananias, "why hath &s;atan filled thine heart to lie unto the Holy Gho&s;t?"</P>
<P>Now, why &s;hould there be &s;uch a combination among the in&s;pired writers, to lay this heavy charge upon the devil, as being guilty of influencing and cau&s;ing men to &s;in, if God creates and produces it him&s;elf?&mdash;For my part, I don't think it is right to belie and &s;lander the devil, becau&s;e he is a bad crea|ture: no, give the devil his due: and if he has been &s;landered and charged wrongfully, let him
<PB N="21" REF="028849_0011_0FDE250B8CBDE2F8">
have ju&s;tice done him. And altho' the advocates for this novelty have virtually, and for &s;ub&s;tance, acquitted the devil of this charge, by laying it upon God: yet if their doctrine be true, they ought to &s;ee to it that they procure, in the devil's behalf, a more explicit, public, and honourable acquitance than they have yet given him.</P>
<P N="7">7. If we allow, and maintain, that God creates &s;in then I remark, that it mu&s;t give &s;uch an idea of the character of the ever ble&s;&s;ed God, that is too &s;hocking to admit.</P>
<P>Some have &s;uppo&s;ed, that if God had left Adam in a &s;tate of pure nature, when he was fir&s;t created, and had not put him under any covenant or con&s;ti|tution at all, if he had continued a thou&s;and years in perfect obedience, as he owed all that obedience to God, he could not thereby have brought God into debt to him: &s;o they &s;uppo&s;e God might have annihilated him after a thou&s;and years of perfect ho|line&s;s and happine&s;s, and have done Adam no inju&s;|tice at all. And this point I don't mean to con|trovert: but we know that according to &s;cripture, Adam was not thus left. God was plea&s;ed to put him under a divine con&s;titution, called the covenant of works, the tenor of which was, <HI>do and live, di&s;o|bey and die.</HI> Now in the&s;e circum&s;tances, if God had inflicted the calamity of natural death upon Ad|am, while he continued obedient, it would have been a violation of the con&s;titution on God's part; therefore he infinitely abhorred to do &s;uch a thing. How then could God inflict upon Adam a calamity a thou&s;and times greater than meerly natural death! which he really did if he took away his original
<PB N="22" REF="028849_0012_0FDE250D02622350">
righteou&s;ne&s;s, and created &s;in in him prior to his eating the forbidden fruit? this would have been inflicting death upon his &s;oul a dreadful calamity, when he was guilty of no crime.</P>
<P>Adam's holine&s;s was the true life of his &s;oul, and ab&s;olutely e&s;&s;ential to his happine&s;s. Therefore, to &s;uppo&s;e that God did thus rob, plunder, and I may &s;ay, murder the &s;oul of innocent Adam, is too &s;hocking to admit. Did God create Adam holy, and enjoin it upon him to keep, maintain, and ex|erci&s;e it upon the pain of eternal death? And then in a way of divine prerogative and &s;overeignty, take it away from him, and create and produce &s;in in him, and thereby cau&s;e him to become a voluntary &s;inner, and then plead a right in ju&s;tice to &s;end him to hell, for the very &s;in that he him&s;elf produced? who can po&s;&s;ibly believe this, that is not in a delirium?&mdash;If we could &s;ee a conduct, in any one in&s;tance, among the children of men, any thing &s;imilar hereunto, eve|ry body's indignation would be excited. As for in|&s;tance, and to come as near to it as we can:&mdash;Let us &s;uppo&s;e an earthly King comes to his throne, and is received by all his &s;ubjects with acclamations of joy, and entire loyalty in their hearts; and when he is e&s;tabli&s;hed in his kingdom he promulgates his good and whole&s;ome laws, with a promi&s;e, that if his &s;ubjects will continue in their loyalty and obedi|ence, he will protect them in the enjoyment of all their rea&s;onable liberties and privileges; but if any of them turn rebels and break his laws, they &s;hall be puni&s;hed with death. To this, all his &s;ubjects heartily &s;ay, amen. And thus they live in mutual peace and happine&s;s, and a pro&s;pect of always con|tinuing &s;o.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="028849_0012_0FDE250D02622350">But now, let us &s;uppo&s;e, (for here we can &s;peak only by way of &s;uppo&s;ition, for the thing in reality can't be&punc;)&mdash;but I &s;ay, let us &s;uppo&s;e that this King have an ea&s;y acce&s;s to the hearts of his &s;ubjects, and by the arm of his power takes away the &s;pirit of loy|alty from a number of his &s;ubjects, and creates, and produces in them a &s;pirit of rebellion, and thereby cau&s;es them to be voluntary in their rebellion; which as &s;oon as ever it appears, the king declares they &s;hall be puni&s;hed with death, and brings them upon trial, rebellion is proved again&s;t them, and the &s;entence of death is pa&s;t upon them.</P>
<P>But here we will further &s;uppo&s;e, that one in the capacity of an attorney undertakes to plead for the&s;e condemned rebels, and addre&s;&s;es him&s;elf to the king in the following manner:&mdash;"May it plea&s;e your Ma|je&s;ty, to hear me a few words in the behalf of the&s;e condemned rebels, as you know that I am acquain|ted with the whole affair. The&s;e men were once loyal &s;ubjects, and cordial in their obedience, and would ever have remained &s;o if you had let them alone, and &s;uffer'd them to have acted out their na|tive di&s;po&s;ition: but you know that you took away from them that &s;pirit of loyalty by the arm of your power, and created in them that &s;pirit of rebellion they now have, and you po&s;itively excited and pro|duced every exerci&s;e of it they ever had; and &s;eeing this is undeniably the ca&s;e, I think you ought to mitigate their puni&s;hment, or excu&s;e them entire|ly."&mdash;No, &s;ays the king: 'tis no matter how they came by their rebellious di&s;po&s;itions, rebellion in its own nature, merits death, and hang'd they &s;hall be;&mdash;and puts the &s;entence into execution.&mdash;Now
<PB N="24" REF="028849_0013_0FDE25125D689C38">
in this &s;uppo&s;ed ca&s;e, every body would cry out again&s;t this king, and condemn him for a wicked ty|rant and &s;ubtile knave, that de&s;erved hanging more than any of his rebellious &s;ubjects. And yet this bla&s;phemous novelty charges all this upon God. I wonder its advocates are not a&s;hamed to appear in &s;uch a cau&s;e, which might well make the devil blu&s;h to e&s;pou&s;e per&s;onally; and &s;o he hides behind the curtain, and &s;ets them to do the work for him.</P>
<P N="8">8. If we allow that God creates &s;in, or produces it by his po&s;itive agency, then I remark, that a chri&s;tian has got another, greater, harder, and more difficult piece of work to do than ever was known before. Chri&s;tians always knew that they had got to &s;trive and watch again&s;t &s;in, and all temp|tations leading to it, and hence to maintain a con|&s;tant warfare again&s;t the world, the fle&s;h, and the devil.&mdash; The world, with its alluring charms, will en&s;nare and draw the chri&s;tian into &s;in, if he is not watchful and very much on his guard.</P>
<P>The fle&s;h, that is, corrupt nature, the un&s;ancti|fied part of even regenerate men,&mdash;is a dangerous enemy; and the chri&s;tian mu&s;t be active by the grace of God to crucify the fle&s;h with the affections and lu&s;ts, and thro' the &s;pirit to mortify the deeds of the body; or by this enemy he will be drawn into &s;in.&mdash;The devil, the avowed adver&s;ary of mankind in general, and of true chri&s;tians in particular, is going about as a roaring lion, &s;eeking whom he may devour: and the chri&s;tian &s;oul is called to re&s;i&s;t this adver&s;ary, &s;tedfa&s;t in the faith; and for his encou|ragement, the Apo&s;tle tells him&punc; "Re&s;i&s;t the devil and he &s;hall flee from thee, and &s;atan &s;hall be brui&s;|ed
<PB N="25" REF="028849_0013_0FDE25125D689C38">
under your feet &s;hortly."&mdash;So that the chri&s;tian has a pro&s;pect of getting the victory over the&s;e po|tent enemies, the world, the fle&s;h, and the devil, but, O! what will the poor chri&s;tian do, when he has Infinite Power to re&s;i&s;t, and war again&s;t! when God comes to create &s;in in him, and with his almigh|ty agency determines to produce it, and thereby cau&s;e the chri&s;tian to give his con&s;ent to &s;in. O ca|lamity indeed! prior to the exertion of this creating power, the chri&s;tian had acted in character; &s;in|cerely hated all &s;in, and longed to be entirely deli|vered from it. Yea, he had exerted him&s;elf man|ully, and had got con&s;iderable victory over his &s;pi|ritual enemies, the world, the fle&s;h, and the devil. And he meant and intended, prayed, and hoped, to keep the conque&s;t he had gained, and to gain more and more daily. But, O! alas! for the poor chri&s;|tian; what a dreadful di&s;appointment did he meet with, when the creating power of God was exerted, and the po&s;itive agency of the Mo&s;t High, produ|cing a change in the bias and di&s;po&s;ition of his &s;oul to &s;uch a degree, that it was not all the habits of grace, or principles of love to God and holine&s;s, which were to a good degree prevalent but a little before, that could now prevent the chri&s;tian from yielding and con&s;enting to that which is &s;in! And when the chri&s;tian &s;oul comes to reflect on what he has done, he is ready to wring his hands in de&s;pair, and &s;ay, O, alas! I never can get victory over &s;in, &s;o long as God keeps creating of it in me. I had, and long have had, courage to war again&s;t all the powers of hell; but to &s;trive again&s;t, and re&s;i&s;t the creating power of God, will be entirely fruitle&s;s, if not high|ly pre&s;umptuous.</P>
<P N="9"><PB N="26" REF="028849_0014_0FDE2513CB9CA800">9. The la&s;t remark I &s;hall make upon this novel|ty, which a&s;&s;erts that God creates &s;in, is, that if &s;ome of the warme&s;t advocates for it, who are anx|ious to have it &s;pread, and be univer&s;ally received, will contrive matters &s;o as to &s;end, from among them&s;elves, &s;ome mi&s;&s;ionaries down to the dark re|gions and preach this novelty there to the fallen An|gels: and if they &s;hould happen to be credited, and their doctrine be believed, I doubt not but my con|jecture will prove to be a truth, viz. That it would make the devils rejoice, and &s;et them all a praying, if not prai&s;ing God, with the &s;ame tempers and de|vili&s;h di&s;po&s;itions they now have; it would &s;uit them &s;o well to the very heart.</P>
<P>But my friend, you will &s;ay, that now I am ex|travagant: What! will the devils pray? why yes, when they can have a pro&s;pect of an&s;wering their own ends by it. We read that the devils pray'd, or be&s;ought Chri&s;t that he would &s;uffer them to enter into the herd of &s;wine, that they might drive them head-long into the &s;ea, and thereby prejudice the whole country again&s;t Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>But if you &s;cruple the truth of my conjecture, I will point out to you an in&s;tance wherein we may naturally &s;uppo&s;e the devils will be ready to pray to God, if they can be made to believe that God cre|ates &s;in, or produces it by his po&s;itive agency. You know, &s;ir, that tis the con&s;tant work and bu&s;ine&s;s of the devils, to endeavour to tempt mankind to &s;in, in order to bring them down to de&s;truction.&mdash;There|fore, when they have laid their train of temptations before men, to induce one to commit murder, ano|ther to commit adultery, &amp; others to lie, &s;teal, roo, &amp;c. and as the devils are very de&s;irous of &s;ucce&s;s;
<PB N="27" REF="028849_0014_0FDE2513CB9CA800">
and believing that if God don't create &s;in in the&s;e men in this very juncture, and produce evil voli|tions in them by his po&s;itive agency, &s;o that they will voluntarily comply with their temptations; all their attempts will prove abortive, and their labour will be but in vain. Therefore we may naturally &s;uppo&s;e, that in the belief of this novelty, the de|vils will pray in language like this following, viz.&mdash; <Q>O Lord God of infinite knowledge and power, thou &s;ee&s;t what a train of temptations we have laid before the&s;e men, to induce them to commit the &s;everal abominations we wi&s;h and de&s;ire they might; and thou, O Lord God of infinite power, art able to give us &s;ucce&s;s, and all our labour will be lo&s;t and in vain if thou do&s;t not: as when Chri&s;t's mini&s;ters preach the Go&s;pel, and do their utmo&s;t endeavour to bring &s;inners to repentance and holy exerci&s;es, all their labour will be lo&s;t and in vain, unle&s;s thy divine power does attend, and thou, by thy po&s;itive agency, do&s;t produce holy tempers, di&s;po&s;itions and exerci&s;es: even Paul may plant, and Apollos water to no pur|po&s;e, unle&s;s God will plea&s;e to give the increa&s;e. And &s;o, O Lord, it is with us weak and feeble devils; we need thy help and a&s;&s;i&s;tance, as much as Chri&s;t's mini&s;ters do; and unle&s;s thou wilt be plea&s;ed to afford it, &s;atan may plant, and belze|bub him&s;elf may water in vain, for it is thou, O Lord, only, who art able to give the increa&s;e. And altho' we know thou art determined to build up the kingdom of Chri&s;t in the world, yet thou ha&s;t power enough to build up our kingdom too, and if they are in direct oppo&s;ition the one from the other, no matter for that, for the &s;criptures &s;ay, thou can&s;t do every thing. Now, there|fore,
<PB N="28" REF="028849_0015_0FDE25155BF23878">
O Lord God Almighty, be plea&s;ed to ex|ert thy power, and create &s;in in the&s;e men &s;ev|erally; and by thy po&s;itive agency, cau&s;e them to comply with our temptations, and hell it&s;elf will rejoice with our &s;ort of malicious joy, if we don't in a formal manner keep a day of thank&s;|giving. And what, O Lord, has embolden'd and encourag'd us thus to pray unto thee, in hopes of &s;ucce&s;s, is a novelty lately imbibed in hell, which teaches us that God does in reality create &s;in, and produce it by his po&s;itive agency. This is good news for us: we expect now, our work will be facilitated much; for when a migh|ty auxiliary from heaven will a&s;&s;i&s;t hell, and In|finite Power engage on our &s;ide, we may expect every thing. We need but put the point of the nail where we wi&s;h to have it enter, and one blow &s;truck by Almighty Power will drive it up to the head.&mdash;But, O, alas! while we are thus &s;peak|ing, our faith in this novelty begins to &s;tagger, con&s;idering the ri&s;e of it; for we mu&s;t own that it was invented and propagated by men on earth, which we our&s;elves deceived; and if we our&s;elves &s;hould be deceived by it, the deception would be doubly develi&s;h.</Q></P>
<P>But in as much as the advocates for this novelty pretend in general to have a great veneration for the writings of pre&s;ident Edwards and Dr Bella|my; I &s;hall, (as I &s;aid,) cite a few pa&s;&s;ages from their works, which will &s;hew what they thought of this novelty.</P>

<P>Again he &s;ays, <Q>That there is a great difference between the &s;un's being the cau&s;e of the light|&s;omene&s;s and warmth of the atmo&s;phere, and brightne&s;s of gold and diamonds by its pre&s;ence and po&s;itive influence; and tis being the occa&s;ion of darkne&s;s and fro&s;t, in the night, by its motion, whereby it de&s;cends below the horizon. The motion of the &s;un is the occa&s;ion of the latter kind of events, but it is not the proper cau&s;e, efficient or producer of them. No more is any action of the Divine Being the cau&s;e of the evil of mens wills. Sin is not the fruit of any agency or influ|ence of the Mo&s;t High.</Q>&mdash;(The &s;ame Book page 363, 364.)</P>
<P>From the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages I remark three things:</P>
<P N="1">1 That Mr. Edwards &s;uppo&s;ed, that &s;in did ari&s;e from the creature; that God was not the effi|cient, or producer of it.</P>
<P N="2">2. He &s;uppo&s;ed, that it was a matter of impor|tance, that this &s;hould appear to be the ca&s;e.</P>
<P N="3">3. That it was a &s;ettled point with him that in fact this doth appear to be the ca&s;e.&mdash;And how it ever came to enter into the heart or head of any man, to think otherwi&s;e, is very &s;trange, in one view of the ca&s;e; but not &s;o &s;trange, when we con&s;ider that
<PB N="30" REF="028849_0016_0FDE2516BA437760">
fondne&s;s for novelty, and a plea&s;ing conceit of knowing more than ever was known, &s;timulates ma|ny in the pre&s;ent day, who, in their own view, <HI>leap at &s;tars, but fa&s;ten in the mud.</HI></P>
<P>I have &s;een numbers, of but ordinary abilities, and of but &s;hort opportunities for the &s;tudy of divi|nity, who yet will not he&s;itate to &s;ay, without a blu&s;h, they know more then Pre&s;ident Edwards did; but to attone for their arrogance, they will give him credit in part. They will allow that Mr. Ed|wards was eminent in his day, but it is now a day of greater light: And be&s;ide, &s;ay they, we that come after him, have the benefit of his writings, that when we come to &s;tand upon his &s;houlders, no wonder that we can &s;ee further than he did. But I rather &s;u&s;pect the truth of the ca&s;e lies here; Mr. Edwards was a tall man, and when they pre&s;um'd to clamber up upon his &s;houlders, it carried them &s;o much out of ther proper &s;phere, and higher than their capacities were able to bear, that it cau&s;ed their heads to &s;wim, and their brains to turn, till they were &s;truck with a fit of delirium, and never have come out of it &s;ince. And 'tis no uncommon thing, for people in a delirium, to take a fancy that they know every thing.</P>
<P>I proceed now to cite a pa&s;&s;age from Dr. Bel|lamy's writings upon this point. He is &s;peaking of us as we are now, fallen creatures, and not of Ad|am as he was originally made. And he &s;ays, <Q>God only creates the naked e&s;&s;ence of our &s;ouls, our natural faculties; a power to <HI>think</HI> and will, and to love and hate; and the evil bent of our hearts is not of his making, but is the &s;pontaneous pro|pen&s;ity of our own wills: For we being born de|void
<PB N="31" REF="028849_0016_0FDE2516BA437760">
of the divine image, ignorant of God, and in&s;en&s;ible of his infinite glory, do of our own ac|cord turn to our&s;elves, and to things of time and &s;en&s;e, &amp; to anything that &s;uits a gracele&s;s heart, &amp; there all our affections center; from whence we natively become aver&s;e to God, and to all that is &s;piritually good, and inclined to all &s;in. So that the po&s;itive corruption of our nature, is not any thing created by God.</Q>&mdash;(True Religion deli|neated, page 171).</P>
<P>But after all that has been &s;aid, I &s;uppo&s;e that there are &s;ome that will neither be rea&s;on'd, nor ridicul'd out of their errors; but like tho&s;e &s;poken of by the Prophet, "who hold fa&s;t deceit and re|fu&s;e to let it go." And not only &s;o, but I expect they will put on a cloak of Gravity, and pretend that I have been guilty of a great deal of wicked|ne&s;s, in not treating &s;uch a &s;ubject with more &s;eri|ou&s;ne&s;s.&mdash;To which I an&s;wer,&mdash;</P>
<P N="1">1. That I believe there are more &s;erious and weighty arguments in the foregoing performance, than the advocates for this novelty de&s;ire to &s;ee, or know what to do with.</P>
<P N="2">2. When the prophet Elijah once had a call to have concern with matters and things, (1 Kings 18.27.) which were really ridiculous, he treated them in &s;uch a manner, as was calculated to make their ridiculou&s;ne&s;s appear more glaring; altho' &s;ome might be ready to charge him with levity. And I verily believe this novelty, which charges God with creating &s;in, is as ridiculous as any per&s;on or thing the prophet Elijah had to deal with. And with an hone&s;t mind I have attempted to make it appear.</P>
<P N="3">3. But if the advocates for this novelty, &s;till per|&s;i&s;t that I have been very wicked in the manner of
<PB N="32" REF="028849_0017_0FDE251BE26442A0">
handling this &s;ubject,&mdash;I have this to tell them, viz. That if their doctrine be true, I have not, neither in matter nor manner, committed a whit more &s;in than God created in me, or produced by his po&s;itive agency. And I never will blame any man who commits no more &s;in than what God creates in him: If he is guilty of no other crimes, I think he is very excu&s;able.</P>
<P>But I &s;hall tire your patience, my friend; and therefore &s;hall add no more than this one remark, viz. That execrable mon&s;ter William Beadle, who murdered his family and him&s;elf, with great delib|eration, at Weathersfield, a few years ago, firmly believed that he was po&s;itively influenced by God to do all that: For he had it in contemplation three years, and got fully e&s;tabli&s;hed that he was influen|ced by God to do it, before, it &s;eems, he dare un|dertake it; as appears by his own private writings, made public in the &s;ermon preached at the funeral of his murdered family.</P>
<P>But you will &s;ay, my friend, that he had renoun|ced the chri&s;tian religion, and profe&s;&s;ed to be a Dei&s;t: 'Tis true, he did &s;o; and I think it is as true, that that it is not fitting that any man &s;hould profe&s;s to believe that God, by his po&s;itive agency, does in|fluence men to &s;in; until that they have fir&s;t re|nounced the chri&s;tian religion as Beadle did.</P>
<P>But, my friend, before you fully adopt this no|velty, I wi&s;h you to an&s;wer one que&s;tion that I &s;hall now propo&s;e, viz. That if God does create &s;in, and is the great efficient of it; then, when Chri&s;t &s;ub|dues it in his redeemed people, what truth or &s;en&s;e can there be in &s;aying he de&s;troys the works of the devil,&mdash;when it is manife&s;t, that it is one branch of God's workman&s;hip that he de&s;troys?</P>
