<HEAD>MARTIN LUTHER, THE GREAT REFORMER.</HEAD>
<P>IN the order of time, we come now to treat of a mo&s;t wonderful man, whom GOD rai&s;ed up in the&s;e la&s;t ages of the world, to break the chain of &s;uper&s;tition and &s;piritual &s;lavery, with which the bi&s;hops of Rome and their depend|ents had, for many centuries, ca&s;t over the con&s;ciences of all men. He was an in&s;trument truly prepared for this great work; and yet but a mean and ob&s;cure monk, to &s;hew us, that HE, who ruleth all things, effected him&s;elf the im|portant de&s;ign, in which the greate&s;t prince upon earth would have undoubtedly failed.</P>
<P>The conduct of the dignified clergy through|out all Europe, had long given &s;candal to the world. The bi&s;hops were gro&s;sly ignorant: They &s;eldom re&s;ided in their dioce&s;es, except to riot at high fe&s;tivals: And all the effect their re&s;idence could have, was to corrupt others, by their ill example. Nay &s;ome of them could not &s;o much as write, but employed &s;ome per&s;on, or chaplain who had attained that accompli&s;h|ment, to &s;ub&s;cribe their names for them. They followed the courts of princes, and a&s;pired to the greate&s;t offices. The abbets and monks
<PB N="4" REF="035737_0003_10064E5425FD9218">were wholly given up to luxury and idlene&s;s; and it appeared, by the unmarried &s;tate both of the &s;eculars and regulars, that the re&s;training them from having wives of their own, made them conclude they had a right to all other men's. The inferior clergy were no better; and not having places of retreat to conceal their vices in, as the monks had, they became more public. In &s;um; all ranks of churchmen were &s;o univer&s;ally de&s;pi&s;ed and hated, that the world was very apt to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with preju|dice again&s;t their doctrines, for the &s;ake of the men who&s;e intere&s;t it was to &s;upport them: And the wor&s;hip of God was &s;o defiled with gro&s;s &s;uper&s;tition, that, without great enqui|ries, all men are ea&s;ily convinced, that the church &s;tood in great need of reformation. This was much increa&s;ed when &s;cripture and the books of the fathers were rendered common by the art of printing, and began to be read, in which the difference between the former and later ages of the church very evidently appear|ed. They found, that a blind &s;uper&s;tition came fir&s;t in the room of true piety; and when by its means, the wealth and intere&s;t of the clergy were highly advanced, the popes had upon that e&s;tabli&s;hed their tyranny; under which, not only the meaner people, but even the crowned heads, had long groaned. All the&s;e things concurred to make way for the ad|vancement of the reformation.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="035737_0004_10064E55B046EEB8">
Wickliffe, Hu&s;s, Jerom of Prague, and o|thers, had laid the &s;eeds of the reformation, which Luther nouri&s;hed with great warmth. The &s;candalous extolling of indulgences gave the fir&s;t occa&s;ion to all the contradiction that followed between Luther and the church of Rome; in which if the corruptions and cruelty of the clergy had not been &s;o vi&s;ible and &s;canda|lous, &s;o &s;mall a matter could not have produced &s;uch a revolution: But any cri&s;is will put ill humours into a ferment.</P>
<P>As prote&s;tants, we are certainly much obli|ged to Era&s;mus; yet we are far more obliged, under God, to tho&s;e great in&s;truments of the reformation, viz. Luther, Zuinglius, Oeco|lampadius, Bucer; Melancthon, Cranmer, and others. The greate&s;t enemies of Luther cannot deny, but that he had eminent qualities; and hi&s;tory affords nothing more &s;urpri&s;ing than what he had done: For a &s;imple monk to be able to give popery &s;o rude a &s;hock, that there needed but &s;uch another entirely to overthrow the Romi&s;h church, is what we cannot &s;uffici|ently admire, and marks the hand of providence conducting the whole. It was &s;aid, with rea|&s;on, that Era&s;mus, by his railleries, prepared the way for Luther; and Simon Fontaine the popi&s;h hi&s;torian, complained, that Era&s;mus oc|ca&s;ionally had done more mi&s;chief than Luther; becau&s;e Luther only opened the door wider, after Era&s;mus had picked the lock, and half
<PB N="6" REF="035737_0005_10064E57432B6E90">opened it. Notwith&s;tanding all this, &s;ays Bayle, there mu&s;t have been eminent gifts in Luther to produce &s;uch a revolution as he has done.</P>
<P>Martin Luther was born at I&s;leben, a town in the county of Mansfield, in the circle of Up|per Saxony, on the tenth of November, 1483. His father was called John Luther, or Luder, becau&s;e he was a refiner of metals; for Luder, in the German language, has that &s;ignification: It is agreed that his bu&s;ine&s;s was about the mines; and that he was the chief magi&s;trate of the city of Mansfield. His mother's name was Margaret Lindeman, who was remarkable for her piety.</P>
<P>When Martin Luther was fourteen years of age, he was &s;ent to the public &s;chool of Mag|deburg, where he continued one year, and was then removed to that of Ey&s;enach, where he &s;tudied four years. The circum&s;tances of his parents were at that time &s;o very low, and &s;o in&s;ufficient to maintain him, that he was forced, as Melchior Adam relates, to live by begging his bread. When he had fini&s;hed his grammar &s;tudies, he was &s;ent to the famous &s;chool at Ey&s;enach in Thuringia, for the &s;ake of being among his mother's relations, where he applied him&s;elf very diligently to his books for four years, and began to di&s;cover all that force and &s;trength of parts; that accutene&s;s and penetra|tion, that warm and rapid eloquence, which afterwards were attended with &s;uch amazing
<PB N="7" REF="035737_0006_10064E591325EAA0">&s;ucce&s;s. In the year 1501, he was entered at the univer&s;ity of Erford or Erfurt, in Thurin|gia where he went through a cour&s;e of philo&s;o|phy, and was admitted ma&s;ter of arts, in 1503, being then twenty years old. He was &s;oon af|ter made profe&s;&s;or of phy&s;ic, and ethics: But he chiefly applied him&s;elf to the &s;tudy of the civil law, and intended to advance him&s;elf to the bar, from which he was diverted by an uncom|mon accident. As he was walking in the fields with a friend, he was &s;truck by a thunderbolt, which threw him to the ground, and killed his companion: Whereupon Luther re&s;olved to withdraw from the world, and enter into the order of the hermits of St. Augu&s;tine. He made his profe&s;&s;ion in the mona&s;try of Erfurt, where he took prie&s;t's orders, and celebrated his fir&s;t ma&s;s in the year 1507.</P>
<P>It is reported, that there was an old man in this mona&s;try, with whom Luther had &s;everal conferences upon many theological &s;ubjects, particularly concerning the article of remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins. This article was explained by the old monk to Luther, <Q>That it was the expre&s;s commandment of God, that every man &s;hould believe his &s;ins to be forgiven him in Chri&s;t.</Q> Luther found this interpretation was confirmed by the te&s;timony of St. Bernard, who &s;ays. 'That man is freely ju&s;tified by faith.' He then perceived the meaning of St. Paul, when <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">, We are ju&s;tified by faith.' He
<PB N="8" REF="035737_0007_10064E5DC0F817B8">con&s;ulted the expo&s;itions of many writers upon that apo&s;tle, and &s;aw through the vanity of tho&s;e interpretations, which he had read before the &s;choolmen. He compared the &s;ayings and examples of the prophets, and apo&s;tles.</P>
<P>In 1508, the univer&s;ity of Wittenburg, in the duchy of Saxony, was e&s;tabli&s;hed under the direction of Staupitius, who&s;e good opinion of Luther occa&s;ioned him to &s;end for him from Er|furt to Wittenberg, where he taught philo&s;o|phy; and his lectures were attended by many wi&s;e and learned men. He expounded the lo|gic and philo&s;ophy of Ari&s;totle, in the &s;chools; and began to examine the old theology, in the churches.</P>
<P>In the year 1512, he was &s;ent to Rome, to take up &s;ome controver&s;ies which happened a|mong his order; and he conducted him&s;elf &s;o well as to obtain the character of a prudent man. In &s;hort, he &s;ucceeded in his bu&s;ine&s;s; for which he was made doctor and profe&s;&s;or of divinity, upon his return to Wittenberg. At Rome he &s;aw the pope and court, and had an opportunity al&s;o of ob&s;erving the manners of the clergy; who&s;e ha&s;ty, &s;uperficial, and im|pious way of celebrating ma&s;s, he has &s;everely noted. "I performed ma&s;s, &s;ays he, at Rome; I &s;aw it al&s;o performed by others, but in &s;uch a manner, that I never think of it without the utmo&s;t horror." He often &s;poke afterwards of his journey to Rome, and u&s;ed to &s;ay that
<PB N="9" REF="035737_0008_10064E5F49F96FB0"><Q>He would not but have made it for a thou&s;and florins.</Q> A monki&s;h poet him&s;elf, upon the view of the barefaced iniquity of the popes pre|tended holy city, could not help &s;inging: <Q>If you would live righteou&s;ly, keep clear of Rome: For though her prie&s;ts can licen&s;e every thing el&s;e, they allow of nothing good.</Q></P>
<P>After this, he began to expound the epi&s;tle to the Romans, and the P&s;alms; where he &s;hewed the difference between the law and the go&s;pel. He refuted the error that was then predominant in &s;chools and &s;ermons; that men may merit remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins by their own proper works. As John Bapti&s;t demon&s;trated the Lamb of God which took away the &s;ins of the world: So Luther, &s;hining in the church as a bright &s;tar after an ob&s;cure &s;ky, expre&s;sly &s;hew|ed, that &s;ins are freely remitted for the love of the Son of God, and that we ought faithfully to embrace this bountiful gift.</P>
<P>His life was corre&s;pondent to his profe&s;&s;ion and the&s;e happy beginnings of &s;uch important matter, procured him great authority. How|ever, he attempted no alteration in the ceremo|nies of religion, and interfered in no doubtful opinions: But contented him&s;elf with opening and declaring the doctrine of repentance, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins, of faith, and of true comfort in times of adver&s;ity. His doctrine was gener|ally approved by the learned, who conceived
<PB N="10" REF="035737_0009_10064E60D5AD5CB8">high plea&s;ure to behold Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the pro|phets, and apo&s;tles, to emerge into the light out of darkne&s;s: whereby they began to under|&s;tand the difference between the law and the go&s;pel, between &s;piritual righteou&s;ne&s;s and ci|vil things. Era&s;mus revived learning while Luther was teaching divinity at Wittenberg. The former brought the monks barbarous and &s;ophi&s;tical doctrine into contempt by his elegant work; which induced Luther to &s;tudy the Greek and Hebrew languages, that, by draw|ing the doctrine from the very fountains, he might pa&s;s his judgment with more authority.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t opportunity that this great man had of unfolding to the view of a blinded and delu|ded age, the truth, which had &s;truck his a&s;ton|i&s;hed &s;ight, was offered by a Dominican, who&s;e name was John Tetzel. This bold and enter|pri&s;ing monk had been cho&s;en, on account of his uncommon impudence, by Albert archbi&s;hop of Mentz and Magdeburg, to preach and pro|claim, in Germany, tho&s;e famous indulgences of Leo X. which admini&s;tered the remi&s;&s;ion of all &s;ins, pa&s;t, pre&s;ent and to come, however enormous their nature, to tho&s;e who were rich enough to purcha&s;e them. The frontle&s;s monk executed this iniquitous commi&s;&s;ion not only with matchle&s;s in&s;olence, indecency, and fraud, but even carried his impiety &s;o far as to dero|gate from the all-&s;ufficient power and influence of the merits of Chri&s;t. In de&s;cribing the
<PB N="11" REF="035737_0010_10064E62814A17E8">efficacy of the&s;e indulgences, Tetzel &s;aid among other enormities, that <HI>even had any one ravi&s;h|ed the mother of God, he</HI> (Tetzel) <HI>had where|withal to efface his guilt.</HI> He al&s;o boa&s;ted, that <Q><HI>he had &s;aved more &s;ouls from hell by tho&s;e</HI> IN|DULGENCES, <HI>than</HI> ST. PETER <HI>had converted to Chri&s;tianity by his preaching.</HI></Q> At this, Luther unable to &s;mother his ju&s;t indignation, rai&s;ed his warning voice, and in ninety-five propo&s;itions, maintained publickly at Witten|burg, on the 30th of September, in the year 1517, cen&s;ured the extravagant extortion of the&s;e que&s;tors, and plainly pointed out the Ro|man pontiff as a partaker of their guilt, &s;ince he &s;uffered the people to be &s;educed, by &s;uch delu|&s;ions, from placing their principal confidence in Chri&s;t, the only proper object of their tru&s;t. This was the commencement and foundation of that memorable rupture and revolution in the church, which humbled the grandeur of the lordly pontiffs, and eclip&s;ed &s;o great a part of their glory.</P>
<P>This debate between Luther and Tetzel was, at fir&s;t, a matter of no great moment, and might have been terminated with the utmo&s;t facility, had Leo X. been di&s;po&s;ed to follow the healing method which common prudence mu&s;t have naturally pointed out on &s;uch an occa&s;ion. For after all, this was no more than a private di&s;pute between two monks, concerning the extent of the pope's power with re&s;pect to the
<PB N="12" REF="035737_0011_10064E66C4545E30">remi&s;&s;ion of &s;in. Luther confe&s;&s;ed that the Roman pontiff was clothed with the power of remitting the human puni&s;hments inflicted upon tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors, i. e. the puni&s;hments denounced by the church, and its vi&s;ible head the bi&s;hop of Rome; but he &s;trenuou&s;ly denied that his pow|er extended to the remi&s;&s;ion of the divine pu|ni&s;hments allotted to offenders, either in this pre&s;ent, or in a future &s;tate; affirming, on the contrary, that the&s;e puni&s;hments could only be removed by the merits of Chri&s;t. The doctrine of Tetzel was, indeed, directly oppo&s;ite to the &s;entiments of Luther; for this &s;en&s;ele&s;s or de|&s;igning monk a&s;&s;erted, that all puni&s;hments, pre&s;ent and future, human and divine, were &s;ubmitted to the authority of the Roman pontiff, and came within the reach of his ab&s;ol|ving power.</P>
<P>The &s;entiments of Luther were received with applau&s;e by the greate&s;t part of Germany, which had long groaned under the avarice of the pontiffs, and the extortions of their tax-gatherers, and had murmered grievou&s;ly again&s;t the various &s;tratagems that were daily put in practice, with the mo&s;t front|le&s;s impudence, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o flecce the rich, and to grind the faces of the poor. But the votaries of Rome were filled with horror, when they were infor|med of the opinions propagated by the Saxon reformer; more e&s;pecially the Dominicans, who looked upon their order as in&s;ulted and
<PB N="13" REF="035737_0012_10064E68502A1F60">attacked in the per&s;on of Tetzel. The alarm of controver&s;y was therefore founded, and Tetzel him&s;elf appeared immediately in the field again&s;t Luther, who&s;e &s;entiments he pre|tended to refute in two academical di&s;cour&s;es, which he pronounced on occa&s;ion of his promo|tion to the degree of doctor of divinity. In the year following two famous Dominicans, Syl|ve&s;ter de Prierio and Hog&s;trat, the former a native of Italy, and the latter a German, ro&s;e up al&s;o again&s;t the adventurous reformer, and attacked him at Cologn with the utmo&s;t vehem|ence and ardour. Their example was &s;oon followed by another formidable champion, na|med Eckius, a celebrated profe&s;&s;or of divinity at Ingol&s;tadt, and one of the mo&s;t zeajous &s;up|porters of the Dominican order. Luther &s;tood firm again&s;t the&s;e united adver&s;aries, and was neither vanqui&s;hed by their argnments, nor daunted by their talents and reputation: but an&s;wered their objections and refuted their rea|&s;onings with the greate&s;t &s;trength of evidence, and a becoming &s;pirit of re&s;olution and per&s;eve|rance. At the &s;ame time, however, he ad|dre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf by letters, written in the mo&s;t &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive and re&s;pectful terms, to the Roman pontiff and to &s;everal of the bi&s;hops, &s;hewing them the uprightne&s;s of his intentions, as well as the ju&s;tice of his cau&s;e, and declaring his readine&s;s to change his &s;entiments, as &s;oon as he &s;hould &s;ee them fairly proved to be erroneous.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="035737_0013_10064E69DBDE6E10">
At fir&s;t, Leo X. beheld this controver&s;y with indifference and contempt; but, being informed by the emperor Maximilian I not only of its importance, but al&s;o of the fatal divi&s;ions it was likely to produce in Germany, he &s;ummoned Luther to appear before him at Rome, and there to plead the cau&s;e which he had underta|ken to maintain. This papal &s;ummons was &s;u|per&s;eded by Frederick the wi&s;e, elector of Saxony, who pretended, that the cau&s;e of Luther belonged to the juri&s;diction of a German tribunal, and that it was to be decided by the eccle&s;ia&s;tical laws of the empire. The pontiff yielded to the remon&s;trances of this prudent and magnanimous prince, and ordered Luther to ju&s;tify his intentions and doctrines before cardi|nal Cajetan, who was, at this time, legate at the diet of Aug&s;burg. In this fir&s;t &s;tep the court of Rome gave a &s;pecimen of that temerity and imprudence with which all its negociations, in this weighty affair, were afterwards conducted. For, in&s;tead of reconciling, nothing could tend more to inflame matters than the choice of Caje|tan, a Dominican, and, con&s;equently, the decla|red enemy of Luther, and friend of Tetzel, as judge and arbitrator in this nice and perilous controver&s;y.</P>
<P>Luther, however, repaired to Aug&s;burg, in the month of October 1518, and conferred, at three different meetings, with Cajetan him&s;elf, concerning the points in debate. But had he
<PB N="15" REF="035737_0014_10064E6D0A3937D0">even been di&s;po&s;ed to yield to the court of Rome, this imperious legate was, of all others, the mo&s;t improper to encourage him in the execution of &s;uch a purpo&s;e. The high &s;pirit of Luther was not to be tamed by the arrogant dictates of mere authority: &s;uch, however, were the on|ly methods of per&s;ua&s;ion employed by the haughty cardinal. He, in an overbearing tone, de&s;ired Luther to renounce his opinions, with|out <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">even attempting to prove them erroneous, and in&s;i&s;ted, with importunity, on his confe&s;&s;|ing humbly his fault, and &s;ubmitting re&s;pectful|ly to the judgment of the Roman pontiff. The Saxon reformer could not think of yielding to terms &s;o unrea&s;onable in them&s;elves and &s;o de&s;|potically propo&s;ed; &s;o that the conferrence was ab&s;olutely without effect. For Luther, finding his adver&s;ary and judge inacce&s;&s;ible to rea&s;on and argument, left Au&s;b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rg all of a &s;udden, after having appealed from the pre&s;ent deci&s;ions of the pontiff to tho&s;e which he &s;hould pro|nounce, when better informed; and, in this &s;tep, he &s;eemed yet to re&s;pect the dignity and authority of the bi&s;hop of Rome. But Leo X. on the other hand, let loo&s;e the reins to ambi|tion and de&s;poti&s;m, and carried things to the utmo&s;t extremity; for, in the month of No|vember, this &s;ame year, he publi&s;hed a &s;pecial edict, commanding his &s;piritual &s;ubjects to ac|knowledge his <HI>power of delivering from all the puni&s;hments due to &s;in and tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of every
<PB N="16" REF="035737_0015_100646D2DD7031A0">kind.</HI> As &s;oon as Luther received information of this incon&s;iderate and violent mea&s;ure, he perceived, plainly, that it would be impo&s;&s;ible for him to bring the court of Rome to any rea|&s;onable terms; he therefore repaired to Written|burg, and, on the 28th of November, appealed from the pontiff to a general council.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the Roman pontiff became &s;en&s;ible of the imprudence he had been guilty of in entru&s;ting Cajetan with &s;uch a commi&s;&s;ion, and endeavoured to mend the matter by em|ploying a man of more candour and impartialli|ty, and better acquainted with bu&s;ine&s;s, in order to &s;uppre&s;s the rebellion of Luther, and to engage that reformer to &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and obe|dience. This new legate was Charles Miltitz, a Saxon knight, who belonged to the court of Leo X. and who&s;e lay-character expo&s;ed him le&s;s to the prejudices that ari&s;e from a &s;pirit of party, than if he had been clothed with the &s;plendid purple, or the mona&s;tic frock. He was al&s;o a per&s;on of great prudence, penetrati|on, and dexterity, and every way qualified for the execution of &s;uch a nice and critical commi&s;&s;ion as this was. Leo, therefore, &s;ent him into Saxony to pre&s;ent to Frederick the golden con&s;ecrated <HI>ro&s;e</HI> (which the pontiffs are u&s;ed to be&s;tow, as a peculiar mark of di&s;tinction, on tho&s;e princes, for whom they have, or think proper to profe&s;s, an uncommon friend|&s;hip and e&s;teem), and to treat with Luther,
<PB N="17" REF="035737_0016_10064E6FDF3E6DA8">not only about fini&s;hing his controver&s;y with Tetzel, but al&s;o concerning the methods of bringing about a reconciliation between him and the court of Rome. Nor, indeed, were the negociations of this prudent mini&s;ter entire|ly un&s;ucce&s;sful; for in his fir&s;t conference with Luther, at Altenburg, in the year 1519, he carried matters &s;o far as to per&s;uade him to write a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive letter to Leo X. promi&s;ing to ob&s;erve a profound &s;ilence upon the matters in debate, provided that the &s;ame obligation &s;hould be impo&s;ed upon his adver&s;aries. This &s;ame year in the month of October, Miltitz had a &s;econd conference with Luther in the ca&s;tle of Leiben|werd, and a third the year following, at Lich|tenberg. The&s;e meetings, which were reci|procally conducted with moderation and decency, gave great hopes of an approaching reconciliation; nor were the&s;e hopes ill found|ed. But the violent proceedings of the enemies of Luther, and the arrogant &s;pirit, as well as unaccountable imprudence, of the court of Rome, bla&s;ted the&s;e fair expectations, and kin|dled anew the flames of di&s;cord.</P>
<P>Tetzel, on the other hand, burthened with the iniquities of Rome, tormented with a con|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of his own inju&s;tice and extortions, &s;tung with the approbrious cen&s;ures of the new legate, and &s;eeing him&s;elf equally de&s;pi&s;ed and abhorred by both parties, died of grief and de&s;pair</P>

Had the court of Rome been prudent enough to have accepted of the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion made by Lu|ther, they would have almo&s;t nipped in the bud the cau&s;e of the reformation, or would at lea&s;t, have con&s;iderably retarded its growth and pro|gre&s;s.</P>
<P>One of the circum&s;tances that contributed principally, at lea&s;t by its con&s;equences, to ren|der the emba&s;&s;y of Miltitz ineffectual for the re&s;toration of peace, was a famous controver&s;y of an incidental nature that was carried on at Leip&s;ic, &s;ome weeks &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, in the year 1519. A doctor named Eckius, who was one of the mo&s;t eminent and zealous champions in the papal cau&s;e, happened to differ widely from Carlo&s;tadt, the colleague and companion of Lu|ther, in his &s;entiments concerning Free-will. The fir&s;t conflict was between Carlo&s;tadt and Eckius concerning the powers and freedom of the human will; it was carried on in the ca&s;tle of Plei&s;&s;enburg, in pre&s;ence of a numerous and &s;plendid audience, and was followed by a di&s;|pute between Luther and Eckius concerning the authority and &s;upermacy of the Roman pon|tiff. This latter controver&s;y, which the pre|&s;ent &s;ituation of affairs rendered &s;ingularly nice and critical, was left undecided. Hoffman, at that time rector of the univer&s;ity of Leip&s;ic, and who had been al&s;o appointed judge of the arguments alledged on both &s;ides, refu&s;ed to declare to whom the victory belonged; &s;o that
<PB N="19" REF="035737_0018_10064E72F62EFCA8">the deci&s;ion of this matter was referred to the univer&s;ities of Paris and Erfurt.</P>
<P>Among the &s;pectators of this eccle&s;ia&s;tical combat was Philip Melancthon, at that time, profe&s;&s;or of Greek at Wittenburg, who had not, as yet, been involved in the&s;e divi&s;ions (as in|deed the mildne&s;s of his temper and his elegant ta&s;te for polite literature rendered him aver&s;e from di&s;putes of this nature), though he was the intimate friend of Luther, and approved his de&s;ign of delivering the pure and primitive &s;cience of theology from the darkne&s;s and &s;ub|tility of &s;chola&s;tic jargon.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the religious di&s;&s;en&s;ions in Germany increa&s;ed, in&s;tead of dimini&s;hing. For while Miltitz was treating with Luther in Saxony, in &s;uch a mild and prudent manner as offered the faire&s;t pro&s;pect of an approaching ac|ccommodation, Eckius, inflamed with re&s;entment and fury on account of his defeat at Leip&s;ic, repaired with the utmo&s;t precipitation to Rome, to accompli&s;h, as he imagined, the ruin of Luther. There, entering into a league with the Dominicans, who were in high credit at the papal court, and more e&s;pecially with their two zealous patrons, De Prierio and Cajetan, he earne&s;tly entreated Leo X. to level the thunder of his anathemas at the head of Luther, and to exclude him from the communion of the church. The Dominicans, de&s;irous of reveng|ing the affront that, in their opinion, their
<PB N="20" REF="035737_0019_10064E751382A100">whole order had received by Luther's treat|ment of their brother Tetzel, and their patron Cajetan, &s;econded the furious efforts of Eckius again&s;t the Saxon reformer, and u&s;ed their ut|mo&s;t endeavours to have his reque&s;t granted. The pontiff, overcome by the importunity of the&s;e pernicious councellors, imprudently i&s;&s;ued out a bull again&s;t Luther, dated the 15th of June, 1520, in which forty-one pretended he|re&s;ies, extracted from his writings, were &s;o|lemnly condemned, his writings ordered to be publicly burnt, and in which he was again &s;ummoned, on pain of excommunication, to confe&s;s and retract his pretended errors within the &s;pace of &s;ixty days, and to ca&s;t him&s;elf upon the clemency and mercy of the pontiff.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as the account of this ra&s;h &s;entence, pronounced from the papal chair, was brought to Luther, he thought it was high time to con|&s;ult both his pre&s;ent defence and future &s;ecuri|ty; and the fir&s;t &s;tep he took for this purpo&s;e, was the renewal of his appeal from the &s;entence of the Roman pontiff, to the more re&s;pectable deci&s;ion of a general council. But as he fore|&s;aw that this appeal would be treated with con|tempt at the court of Rome, and that when the time pre&s;cribed for his recantation was elap&s;ed, the thunder of excommunication would be le|velled at his devoted head, he judged it prudent to withdraw him&s;elf voluntarily from the com|munion of the church of Rome, before he was
<PB N="21" REF="035737_0020_10064E7984AA65A0">obliged to leave it by force; and thus to ren|der this new bull of ejection a blow in the air, an exerci&s;e of authority without any object to act upon. At the &s;ame time, he was re&s;olved to execute this wi&s;e re&s;olution in a public manner, that his voluntary retreat from the communion of a corrupt and &s;uper&s;titious church might be univer&s;ally known, before the lordly pontiff had prepared his gho&s;tly thunder. With this view, on the 10th of December, in the year 1520, he had a pile of wood erected without the walls of the Wittenburg city, and there, in pre&s;ence of a prodigious multitude of people of all ranks and orders, he committed to the flames both the bull that had been publi&s;hed again&s;t him, and the decretals and cannons relating to the pope's &s;upreme juri&s;diction. By this he declared to the world, that he was no longer a &s;ubject to the Roman pontiff; and that, of con&s;equence, the &s;entence of excommunication again&s;t him, which was daily expected from Rome, was entirely &s;uperfluous and in&s;ignifi|cant. It is not improbable, that Luther was directed, in this critical mea&s;ure, by per&s;ons well &s;killed in the law, who are generally dex|trous in furni&s;hing a perplexed client with nice di&s;tinctions and plau&s;ible eva&s;ions. Be that as it may, he &s;eperated him&s;elf only from the church of Rome, which con&s;iders the pope as infallible, and not from the church, con&s;idered in a more exten&s;ive &s;en&s;e; for he &s;ubmitted to
<PB N="22" REF="035737_0021_10064E7B0E39DC68">the deci&s;ion of the univer&s;al church, when that deci&s;ion &s;hould be given in a general council lawfully a&s;&s;embled. When this judicious di&s;|tinction is con&s;idered, it will not appear at all &s;urpri&s;ing, that many, even of the Roman ca|tholics, who weighed matters with a certain degree of impartiality and wi&s;dom, and were zealous for the maintainance of the liberties of Germany, ju&s;tified this bold re&s;olution of Lu|ther. In le&s;s than a month after this noble and important &s;tep had been taken by the Saxon reformer, a &s;econd bull was i&s;&s;ued out again&s;t him, on the 6th of January, 1521, by which he was expelled from the communion of the church, for having in&s;ulted the maje&s;ty, and di&s;owned the &s;upremacy, of the Roman pon|tiff.</P>
<P>Such iniquitous laws, enacted again&s;t the per&s;on and doctrine of Luther, produced an effect different from what was expected by the imperious pontiff. In&s;tead of intimidating this bold reformer, they led him to form the project of founding a church upon principles entirely oppo&s;ite to tho&s;e of Rome, and to e&s;tabli&s;h, in it, a &s;y&s;tem of doctrine and eccle&s;ia&s;tical di&s;ci|pline, agreeable to the &s;pirit and precepts of the go&s;pel of truth. This, indeed, was the only re&s;ource Luther had left him; for to &s;ubmit to the orders of a cruel and in&s;olent enemy, would have been the greate&s;t degree of imprudence imaginable; and to embrace, anew, errors that
<PB N="23" REF="035737_0022_10064E7CB377D3B8">he had rejected with a ju&s;t iudignation, and expo&s;ed with the cleare&s;t evidence, would have di&s;covered a want of integrity and principle, worthy only of the mo&s;t abandoned profligate. From this time, therefore, he applied him&s;elf to the pur&s;uit of the truth with &s;till more a&s;&s;idui|ty and fervour than he had formerly done; nor did he only review with attention, and con|firm by new arguments, what he had hitherto taught, but went much beyond it, and made vigorous attacks upon the main &s;trong-hold of popery, the power and juri&s;diction of the Ro|man pontiff, which he overturned from its very foundation. In this noble undertaking he was &s;econded by many learned and pious men, in various parts of Europe; by tho&s;e of the profe&s;&s;|ors of the acadamy of Wittenburg, who had adopted his principles; and in a more e&s;pecial manner by the celebrated Melancthon. And as the fame of Luther's wi&s;dom and Melanc|thon's learning had filled that acadamy with an incredible number of &s;tudents, who flocked to it from all parts, this happy circum&s;tance pro|pagated the principles of the reformation with an amazing rapidity through all the countries of Europe.</P>
<P>Not long after the commencement of the&s;e di|vi&s;ions, Maximilian I. had departed this life, and his grand&s;on Charles V. king of Spain, had &s;ucceeded him in the empire in the year 1519. Leo X. &s;eized this new occa&s;ion of venting and
<PB N="24" REF="035737_0023_10064E7E46B7D558">executing his vengeance, by putting the new emperor in mind of his character as <HI>advocate and defender of the church,</HI> and demanding the exemplary puni&s;hment of Luther, who had rebelled again&s;t its &s;acred laws and in&s;titutions. On the other hand, Frederick the Wi&s;e employ|ed his credit with Charles to prevent the publi|cation of any unju&s;t edict again&s;t this reformer, and to have his cau&s;e tried by the canons of the Germanic church, and the laws of the empire. This reque&s;t was &s;o much the more likely to be granted, that Charles was under much greater obligations to Frederick, than to any other of the German princes, as it was chiefly by his zealous and important &s;ervices that he had been rai&s;ed to the empire, in oppo&s;ition to the pre|ten&s;ions of &s;uch a formidable rival as Francis I. king of France. The emperor was &s;en&s;ible of his obligations to the worthy elector, and was entirely di&s;po&s;ed to &s;atisfy his demands. That, however, he might do this without di&s;plea&s;ing the Roman pontiff, he re&s;olved that Luther &s;hould be called before the council, that was to be a&s;&s;embled at Worms in the year 1521, and that his cau&s;e &s;hould be there publicly heard, before any final &s;entence &s;hould be pro|nounced again&s;t him. When &s;ome of his friends, informed of the violent de&s;igns of the Roman court, and alarmed by the bull that had been publi&s;hed again&s;t him by the ra&s;h pontiff, advi|&s;ed him not to expo&s;e his per&s;on at the diet of
<PB N="25" REF="035737_0024_10064E82F9F67C58">Worms, notwith&s;tanding the imperial &s;afe-conduct (which, in a &s;imilar ca&s;e, had not been &s;ufficient to protect John Hu&s;s and Jerome of Prague from the perfidy and curelty of their enemies), he an&s;wered with his u&s;ual intrepe|dity, that <HI>were he obliged to encounter at Worms as many devils as there were tiles upon the hou|&s;es of that city, this would not deter him from his fixed purpo&s;e of appearing there; that fear, in his ca&s;e, could be only a &s;ugge&s;tion of Satan, who apprehended the approaching ruin of his kingdom, and who was willing to avoid a public defeat before &s;uch a grand a&s;&s;embly as the diet of Worms.</HI></P>
<P>Luther, therefore, appeared at Worms, &s;e|cured again&s;t the violence of his enemies by a &s;afe-conduct from the emperor, and, on the 17th of April, and the day following, pleaded his cau&s;e before that grand a&s;&s;embly with the utmo&s;t re&s;olution and pre&s;ence of mind. The united power of threatnings and entreaties were employed to conquer the firmne&s;s of his purpo&s;e, to engage him to renounce the propo&s;itions he had hitherto maintained, and to bend him to a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the Roman pontiff. But he refu|&s;ed all this with a noble ob&s;tinacy, and decla|red &s;olemnly, that he would neither abandon his opinions, nor change his conduct, until he was previou&s;ly convinced, by the word of God, or the dictates of right rea&s;on, that his opini|ons were erroneous, and his conduct unlawful
<PB N="26" REF="035737_0025_10064E8488E13180">When therefore neither promi&s;es nor threat|nings could &s;hake the con&s;tancy of this magna|nimous reformer, he obtained, indeed, from the emperor the liberty of returning, unmole&s;t|ed, to his home; but after his departure from the diet, he was condemned by the unanimous &s;uffrages both by the emperor and the princes, and was declared an enemy of the holy Roman empire. Frederick, who law the &s;torm ri&s;ing again&s;t Luther, u&s;ed the be&s;t precautions to &s;e|cure him from its violence. For this purpo&s;e he &s;ent three or four per&s;ons, in whom he could confide, to meet him on his return from the diet, in order to conduct him to a place of &s;afety. The&s;e emi&s;&s;aries, di&s;gui&s;ed by ma&s;ks, executed their commi&s;&s;ion with the utmo&s;t &s;e|crecy and &s;ucce&s;s. Meeting with Luther, near Ey&s;enac, they &s;eized him, and carried him into the ca&s;tle of Wertenburg, not, as &s;ome have imagined upon probable grounds, was this done without the knowledge of his Imperial maje&s;ty. In this retreat, which he called his Patmos, the Saxon reformer lay con|cealed during the &s;pace of ten months, and emploved this involuntary lei&s;ure in compo&s;iti|ons that were afterwards u&s;eful to the world.</P>
<P>The active &s;pirit of Luther could not howe|ver, long bear this confinement; he therefore left his Patinos in the month of March, of the year 1522, without the con&s;ent, or even the knowledge, of his patron and protector Frede|rick,
<PB N="27" REF="035737_0026_10064E86147551E8">and repaired to Wittenburg. One of the principal motives that engaged him to take this bold &s;tep, was the information he had re|ceived of the incon&s;iderate conduct of Carlo&s;tadt, and &s;ome other friends of the reformation, who had already excited tumults in Saxony, and were acting in a manner equally prejudicial to the tranquility of the &s;tate, and the true inte|re&s;ts of the church. Luther oppo&s;ed the impe|tuo&s;ity of this imprudent reformer with the ut|mo&s;t fortitude and dignity; and to the&s;e pru|dent admonitions this excellent reformer added the influence of example, by applying him&s;elf with redoubled indu&s;try and zeal, to his German tran&s;lation of the Holy Scriptures, which he carried on with expedition and &s;ucce&s;s, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;ome learned and pious men, whom he con&s;ulted in this great and important undertaking. The event abundantly &s;hewed the wi&s;dom of Luther's advice. For the differ|ent parts of this tran&s;lation, being &s;ucce&s;&s;ively and gradually &s;pread abroad among the people, produced &s;udden and almo&s;t incredible effects, and exterpated, root and branch, the erroneous principles and &s;uper&s;titions doctrines of the church of Rome from the minds of a prodigious number of per&s;ons.</P>
<P>While the&s;e things were tran&s;acting, Leo X. departed this life, and was &s;ucceeded in the pontificate by Adrian VI. a native of Utrecht. This pope, who had formerly been preceptor
<PB N="28" REF="035737_0027_10064E89EB727790">to Charles V. and who owed his new dignity to the good offices of that prince, was a man of probity and candour, who acknowledged inge|niou&s;ly that the church laboured under the mo&s;t fatal di&s;orders, and declared his willingne&s;s to apply the remedies that &s;hould be judged the mo&s;t adapted to heal them. He began his pon|tificate by &s;ending a legate to the diet, which was a&s;&s;embled at Nuremberg in 1522. Francis Cheregato, the per&s;on who was intru&s;ted with this commi&s;&s;ion, had po&s;itive orders to demand the &s;peedy and vigorous execution of the &s;en|tence that had been pronounced again&s;t Luther and his followers at the diet of Worms; but, at the &s;ame time, he was authori&s;ed to declare that the pontiff was ready to remove the abu&s;es and grievances that had armed &s;uch a formidable enemy again&s;t the &s;ee of Rome. The princes of the empire, encouraged by this declaration on the one hand, and by the ab&s;ence of the emperor, who, at this time, re&s;ided in Spain, on the other, &s;eized this opportunity of propo|&s;ing the &s;ummoning a general council in Ger|many, in order to deliberate upon the proper methods of bringing about an univer&s;al refor|mation of the church. They exhibited, at the &s;ame time, an hundred articles, containing the heavie&s;t complaints of the injurious treatment the Germans had hitherto received from the court of Rome, and, by a public law, prohib|ited all innovation in religions matters, until a
<PB N="29" REF="035737_0028_10064E8D004F5498">general council &s;hould decide what was to be done in an affair of &s;uch high moment and im|portance.</P>
<P>The pope Adrian did not long enjoy the plea&s;ure of &s;itting at the head of the church. He died in the year 1523, and was &s;ucceeded by Clement VII. a man of a re&s;erved character, and prone to artifice. This pontiff &s;ent to the imperial diet at Nuremberg, in the year 1524, a cardinal-legate, named Campegius, who&s;e orders, with re&s;pect to the affairs of Luther, breathed nothing but &s;everity and violence, and who inveighed again&s;t the lenity of the German princes in delaying the execution of the decree of Worms, while he carefully avoid|ed the &s;malle&s;t mention of the promi&s;e Adrian had made to reform the corruptions of a &s;uper|&s;titious church. The emperor &s;econded the demands of Campegius by the orders he &s;ent to his mini&s;ter to in&s;i&s;t upon the execution of the &s;entence which had been pronounced again&s;t Luther and his adherents at the diet of Worms. The princes of the empire, tired out by the&s;e importunities and remon&s;trances, changed in appearance the law they had pa&s;&s;ed, but con|firmed it in reality. For while they promi&s;ed to ob&s;erve, as far as was po&s;&s;ible, the edict of Worms, they, at the &s;ame time, renewed their demands of a general council, and left all other matters in di&s;pute to be examined and decided at the diet that was &s;oon to be a&s;&s;embled at
<PB N="30" REF="035737_0029_10064E8E8BA39188">Spire. The pope's legate, on the other hand, perceiving by the&s;e proceedings, that the German princes in general were no enemies to the reformation, retired to Rati&s;bon, with the bi&s;hops and tho&s;e of the princes that adhered to the cau&s;e of Rome, and there drew from them a new declaration, by which they engaged them&s;elves to execute rigorou&s;ly the edict of Worms in their re&s;pective dominions.</P>
<P>While the efforts of Luther towards the re|formation of the church were daily crowned with growing &s;ucce&s;s, and almo&s;t all the nations &s;eemed di&s;po&s;ed to open their eyes upon the light, two unhappy occurrences, one of a fo|reign, and the other of a dome&s;tic nature, con|tributed greatly to retard the progre&s;s of this &s;alutary and glorious work. The dome&s;tic, or internal incident, was a controver&s;y concerning the manner in which the body and blood of Chri&s;t were pre&s;ent in the euchari&s;t, that aro&s;e among tho&s;e whom the Roman pontiff had publicly excluded from the communion of the church, and unhappily produced among the friends of the good cau&s;e the mo&s;t deplorable animo&s;ities and divi&s;ions. Luther and his fol|lowers, though they had rejected the mon&s;trous doctrine of the church of Rome with re&s;pect to the <HI>tran&s;ub&s;tatiation,</HI> or change of the bread and wine into the body and blood of Chri&s;t, were neverthele&s;s of opinion, that the partakers of the Lord's &s;upper received, along with the
<PB N="31" REF="035737_0030_10064E90186BB198">bread and wine, the real body and blood of Chri&s;t. Carlo&s;tadt, who was Luther's colleague, under&s;tood the matter quite other|wi&s;e, and his doctrine, which was afterwards illu&s;trated and confirmed by Zoinglius with much more ingenuity than he had propo&s;ed it, amounted to this: <Q>That the body and blood of Chri&s;t were not <HI>really</HI> pre&s;ent in the euchari&s;t; and that the bread and wine were no more than external <HI>&s;igns,</HI> and <HI>&s;ymbols,</HI> de&s;igned to excite in the minds of Chri&s;tians, the remembrance of the &s;ufferings and death of the divine Saviour, and of the benefits which ari&s;e from it.</Q> This opinion was embraced by all the friends of the reformation in Switzerland, and by a con&s;iderable number of its votaries in Germany. On the other hand, Luther maintained his doctrine, in relation to this point, with the utmo&s;t ob&s;tinacy; and hence aro&s;e, in the year 1524, a tedious and vehement controver&s;y, which not with&s;tanding the zealous endeavours that were u&s;ed to re|concile the contending parties, terminated, at length in a fatal divi&s;ion between tho&s;e who had embarked together in the &s;acred cau&s;e of religion and liberty.</P>
<P>To the&s;e inte&s;tine divi&s;ions were added the horrors of a civil war, which was the fatal ef|fect of oppre&s;&s;ion on the one hand, and of enthu&s;ia&s;im on the other; and, by its unhappy con&s;equences, was prejudicial to the cau&s;e and
<PB N="32" REF="035737_0031_10064E93F736AC90">progre&s;s of the reformation. In the year 1525, a prodigious multitude of &s;editions fanaticks a|ro&s;e like a whirlwind, all of a &s;udden, in dif|ferent parts of Germany, took arms, united their forces, waged war again&s;t the laws, the magi&s;trates, and the empire in general, laid wa&s;te the country with fire and &s;word, and exhibited daily the mo&s;t horrid &s;pectacles of unrelenting barbarity. The greate&s;t part of this furious and formidable mob was compo&s;ed of pea&s;ants and va&s;&s;als, who groaned under hea|vy burthens, and declared they were no longer able to bear the de&s;potic &s;everity of their chiefs; and hence this &s;edition was called the <HI>Ru&s;tic war,</HI> or the war of the pea&s;ants. But no &s;oon|er had the enthu&s;ia&s;t Munzer put him&s;elf at the head of this outrageous rabble, than the face of things changed entirely, and by the in&s;tiga|tion of this man, who had deceived numbers before this time by his pretended vi&s;ions and in&s;pirations, the civil commotions in Saxony and Thuringia were &s;oon directed towards a new object, and were turned into a religious war. The &s;entiments, however, of this &s;edi|tious and di&s;&s;olute multitude were greatly divi|ded, and their demands were very different. Luther, &s;ufficiently defended both his principles and his cau&s;e again&s;t this turbulent &s;ect, by the advice he addre&s;&s;ed to the princes of the em|pire to take arms again&s;t them. And, accord|ingly, in the year 1525, this odious faction
<PB N="33" REF="035737_0032_10064E97299124D0">faction was defeated and de&s;troyed, in a pitched battle fought at Mulhau&s;en; and Munzer, their ringleader, taken, and put to death.</P>
<P>Luther laid a&s;ide the friar's habit in October, 1524; and married Catharine de Bore, a lady of noble de&s;cent, who, with eight other nuns, was taken out of the nunnery at Nimpt&s;chen in 1523, and carried to Wittenburg, by Leo|nard Coppen, of Torgan. Luther vindicated that action, and intended to marry Catharine to Glacious mini&s;ter of Ortamunden, who&s;e per&s;on &s;he di&s;liked; and &s;o Luther married her him&s;elf, on the 13th of June, 1525, without con&s;ulting his friends: But Luther &s;ays, he took a wife in obedience to his father's com|mand. Luther was then forty-two, and his wife was twenty-&s;ix. He was &s;o far from be|ing a&s;hamed of entering into the holy &s;tate of matrimony, that he exorted the elector of Mentz, and the grand ma&s;ter of the Teutonic order, to follow his example; which was done by the latter, notwith&s;tanding, the cen&s;ure of the Romani&s;ts. This grand ma&s;ter was Albert margrave of Brandenburg, for whom that part of Pru&s;&s;ia which belonged to the Teutonic or|der was formed into a &s;ecular duty.&mdash;He em|braced the Lutheran religion, renounced his vow of celibacy, and married Anna Maria of Brun&s;wick. He afterwards conformed to the Aug&s;burg confe&s;&s;ion, and founded an univer|&s;ity at Koning&s;berg, in 1544, that the prote&s;|tant
<PB N="34" REF="035737_0033_10064E98B2F87258">religion might be introduced and e&s;tabli&s;h|ed in Pru&s;&s;ia, and all the profe&s;&s;ors were to be Lutherians. In tho&s;e times, marriage &s;oon became a recommendation among the reformers, and was a certain proof that they had abjured popery; for if a converted clergyman did not marry he cau&s;ed a &s;u&s;picion that he had not renounced the doctrine of celibacy.</P>
<P>Luther was very fond of his wife, and u&s;ed to call her his Catharine. She was hand&s;ome and mode&s;t: But he profe&s;&s;ed him&s;elf, that one great rea&s;on which induced him to marry was, to give an example of the doctrine he preached again&s;t celibacy, and to &s;hew, that he was not afraid or a&s;hamed to do him&s;elf, what he exor|ted and enjoined in others.</P>
<P>While the fanatical in&s;urrection rai&s;ed in Germany, Frederick the wi&s;e elector of &s;axony, departed this life. This excellent prince, who&s;e character was di&s;tingui&s;hed by an uncommon degree of prudence and moderation, had, du|ring his life, been a &s;ort of mediator between the Roman pontiff and the reformer of Witten|burg. The elector John, his brother and &s;uc|ce&s;&s;or, acted in a quite different manner. Con|vinced of the truth of Luther's doctrine, and per&s;uaded that it mu&s;t lo&s;e ground and be &s;oon &s;uppre&s;&s;ed if the de&s;potic authority of the Ro|man pontiff remained undi&s;puted and entire, he, without he&s;itation or delay, a&s;&s;umed to
<PB N="35" REF="035737_0034_10064E9A42615C18">him&s;elf the &s;upremacy in eccle&s;ia&s;tical matters, and founded and e&s;tabli&s;hed a church in his dominions, totally different from the church of Rome, in doctrine, di&s;cipline, and government. To bring this new and happy e&s;tabli&s;hment to as great a degree of perfection as was po&s;&s;ible, this re&s;olute and active prince ordered a body of new laws, relating to the form of eccle&s;ia&s;ti|cal government, the method of public wor&s;hip, and other matters of that nature, to be drawn up by Luther and Melancthon, and promulgated by heralds throughout his dominions in the year 1527. The illu&s;trious example of this elec|or was followed by all the princes and &s;tates of Germany, who renounced the papal &s;upremacy and juri&s;diction; and a like form of wor&s;hip, di&s;cipline, and government was thus introduced into all the churches, which di&s;&s;ented from that of Rome. Hence was an open rupture formed between the German princes, of whom oue party embraced the reformation, and the other adhered to the &s;uper&s;titions of their fore|fathers.</P>
<P>Things being reduced to this violent and troubled &s;tate, the patrons of popery gave inti|mations, that were far from being ambiguous, of their intention to make war upon the Lu|theran party, and to &s;uppre&s;s by force a doc|trine which they were incapable of overturning by argument; and this de&s;ign would certainly
<PB N="36" REF="035737_0035_10064E9C2C8C3490">have been put in execution, had not the trou|bles of Europe di&s;concerted their mea&s;ures. The Lutherans, on the other hand, informed of the&s;e ho&s;tile intentions, began al&s;o to delibe|rate upon the mo&s;t effectual methods of defend|ing them&s;elves again&s;t &s;uper&s;tition armed with violence, and formed the plan of a confedera|cy that might an&s;wer this prudent purpo&s;e. In the mean time the diet a&s;&s;embled at Spire, in the year 1526, at which Ferdinand, the emperors brother, pre&s;ided, ended in a man|ner more favourable to the friends of the refor|mation, than they could naturally expect. The emperors emba&s;&s;adors at this diet were ordered to u&s;e their mo&s;t earne&s;t endeavours for the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of all farther di&s;putes con|cerning religion, and to in&s;i&s;t upon the rigour-ous execution of the &s;entence that had been pronounced at Worms again&s;t Luther and his followers. The greate&s;t part of the German princes oppo&s;ed this motion with the utmo&s;t re&s;olution, declaring, that they could not ex|ecute that &s;entence, nor come to any determi|nation with re&s;pect to the doctrines by which it had been occa&s;ioned, before the whole mat|ter was &s;ubmitted to the cognizance of a gene|ral council lawfully a&s;&s;embled; alledging far|ther, that the deci&s;ion of controver&s;ies of this kind belonged properly to &s;uch a council, and to it alone. This opinion after long and warm
<PB N="37" REF="035737_0036_10064EA0539221C0">debates, was adopted by a great majority, and, at length, con&s;ented to by the whole a&s;&s;em|bly.</P>
<P>Nothing could be more favourable to tho&s;e who had the cau&s;e of pure and genuine Chri&s;ti|anity at heart, than a re&s;olution of this nature. For the emperor was, at this time, &s;o entirely taken up in regulating the troubled &s;tate of his dominions in France, Spain, and Italy, which exhibited, from day to day, new &s;cenes of per|plexity, that, for &s;ome years, it was not in his power to turn his attention to the affairs of Germany in general, and &s;till le&s;s to the &s;tate of religion in particular, which was be&s;et with difficulties, that, to a political prince like Charles, mu&s;t have appeared peculiarly critical and dangerous. Be&s;ides, had the emperor real|ly been po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of lei&s;ure to form, or of power to execute, a plan that might terminate, in &s;avour of the Roman pontiff, the religious di&s;|putes which reigned in Germany, it is evident, that the inclination was wanting, and that Clement VII. who now &s;at in the papal chair, had nothing to expect from the good offices of Charles V. For this pontiff, after the defeat of Francis I. at the battle of Pavia, filled with unea&s;y apprehen&s;ions of the growing power of the emperor in Italy, entered into a confedera|cy with the French and the Venetians again&s;t that prince. And this mea&s;ure inflamed the re&s;entment and indignation of Charles to &s;uch
<PB N="38" REF="035737_0037_10064EA1DB3C80F0">a degree, that he ab<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">li&s;hed the papal authority in his Spani&s;h dominions, made war upon the p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">pe in Italy, laid &s;iege to Rome in the year 1527, blocked up Clement in the ca&s;tle of St. Angelo, and expo&s;ed him to the mo&s;t &s;evere and contumelius treatment. The&s;e critical events, together with the liberty granted by the diet of Spire, were prudently and indu&s;tri|ou&s;ly improved, by the friends of the reforma|tion, to the advantage of their cau&s;e, and to the augmentation of their number. In the mean time, Luther and his fellow-labourers, particularly tho&s;e who were with him at Wit|tenberg, by their writings, their in&s;tructions, their admonitions and coun&s;els, in&s;pired the timorous with fortitude, di&s;pelled the doubts of the ignorant, fixed the principles and re&s;o|lution of the floating and incon&s;tant, and ani|mated all the friends of genuine Chri&s;tianity with a &s;pirit &s;uitable to the grandeur of their undertaking.</P>
<P>But the tranquility and liberty they enjoyed, in con&s;equence of the re&s;olutions taken in the fir&s;t diet of Spare, were not of a long duration. They were interrupted by a new diet a&s;&s;em|bled, in the year 1529, in the &s;ame place, by the emperor, after he had appea&s;ed the commo|tions and troubles which had employed his attention in &s;everal parts of Europe, and con|cluded a treaty of peace with Clement VII. This prince, having now got rid of the burthen
<PB N="39" REF="035737_0038_10064EA3749F6B98">that had, for &s;ome time, overwhelmed him, had lei&s;ure to direct the affairs of the church; and this the reformers &s;oon felt, by a di&s;agree|able experience. For the power, which had been granted by the former diet to every prince, of managing eccle&s;ia&s;tical matters as they thought proper; until the meeting of a general council, was now revoked by a majority of votes. This decree was ju&s;tly con&s;idered as iniquirous and intolerable by the elector of Saxony, the landgrave of He&s;&s;e, and the other members of the diet, who were per&s;uaded of the nece&s;&s;ity of a reformation in the church. Therefore, when the princes and members now mentioned found that all their arguments and remon&s;trances again&s;t this unju&s;t decree made no impre&s;&s;ion upon Ferdinand, nor upon the abettors of the ancient &s;uper&s;titions, they enter|ed a &s;olemn prote&s;t again&s;t this decree on the 19th of April, and appealed to the emperor and to a future council. Hence aro&s;e the denomi|nation of <HI>Prote&s;tants,</HI> which from this period has been given to tho&s;e who renounce the &s;uper&s;titious communion of the church of Rome.</P>
<P>The mini&s;ters of the churches, which had embraced the &s;entiments of Luther, were pre|paring a new emba&s;&s;y to the emperor, when an account was received of a de&s;ign formed by that prince to come into Germany, with a view to terminate, in the approaching diet at Aug&s;burg,
<PB N="40" REF="035737_0039_10064EA518DDFB68">the religious di&s;putes that had produced &s;uch animo&s;ities and divi&s;ions in the empire. Hi|therto, indeed; it was not ea&s;y for the emperor to form a clear idea of the matters in debate, &s;ince their was no regular &s;y&s;tem as yet com|po&s;ed, of the doctrines embraced by Luther and his followers, by which their real opinions, and the true cau&s;es of their oppo&s;ition to the Roman pontiff, night be known with certain|ty. As, therefore, it was impo&s;&s;ible, without &s;ome declaration of this nature, to examine with accuracy, or decide with equity, a matter of &s;uch high importance as that which gave ri&s;e to the divi&s;ions between the votaries of Rome. Luther, in compliance with this order, deliver|ed to the elector, at Torgaw, the &s;eventeen articles, which had been drawn up and agreed on in the conference at Sulzbach in the year 1529; and hence they were called the <HI>Articles of Torgaw.</HI> Though the&s;e articles were deemed by Luther a &s;ufficient declaration of the &s;enti|ments of the reformers, yet it was judged pro|per to enlarge them; and, by a judicious de|tail, to give per&s;picuity to their arguments, and thereby &s;trength to their cau&s;e. It was this con&s;ideration that engaged the prote&s;tant princes, a&s;&s;embled at Coburg and Aug&s;burg, to employ Melancthon in extending the&s;e arti|cles, in which important work he &s;hewed a due regard to the coun&s;els of Luther, and expre&s;&s;ed
<PB N="41" REF="035737_0040_10064EA8404FB258">his &s;entiments and doctrine with the greate&s;t elegance and per&s;picuity.</P>
<P>Charles V. arrived at Aug&s;burg the 15th of June 1530, and on the 20th, the diet was opened. As it was unanimou&s;ly agreed, that the affairs of religion &s;hould be brought upon the carpet before the deliberations relating to the intended war with the Turks, the <HI>prote&s;t|ant</HI> members of this great a&s;&s;embly received from the emperor a formal permi&s;&s;ion to pre&s;ent to the diet, on the 25th of June, an account of their religious principles and tenets. In con&s;e|quence of this, the chancellor of Saxony, read, in the German language, in pre&s;ence of the emperor and a&s;&s;embled princes, the famous confe&s;&s;ion, which has been &s;ince di&s;tingui&s;hed by the denomination of the <HI>Confe&s;&s;ion of Aug&s;|burg.</HI> The princes heard it with the deepe&s;t at|tention and recollection of mind; it confirmed &s;ome in the principles they had embraced, &s;ur|pri&s;ed others, and many, who, before this time, had little or no idea of the religious &s;entiments of Luther, were now not only convinced of their innocence, but were moreover, delighted with their purity and &s;implicity.</P>
<P>The tenor and contents of the confe&s;&s;ion of Aug&s;burg are well known. The &s;tyle that reigns in it is plain, elegant, grave, and per|&s;picuous, &s;uch as becomes the nature of the &s;ubject. The matter was, undoubtedly, &s;up|plied by Luther, who, during the diet, re&s;ided
<PB N="42" REF="035737_0041_10064EAB77888998">Coburg, a town in the neighbourhood of Aug&s;|burg; and, even the form it received from the elegant pen of his colleague, was authori&s;ed in con&s;equence of his approbation and advice. This <HI>confe&s;&s;ion</HI> contains twenty-eight chapters, of which the greate&s;t part are employed in re|pre&s;enting, with per&s;picuity a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d truth, the reli|gious opinions of the prote&s;tants, and the re&s;t in pointing out the errors and abu&s;es that occa&s;ioned their &s;eparation from the church of Rome.</P>
<P>The creatures of the Roman pontiff, who were pre&s;ent at this diet, employed John Fa|ber, afterwards bi&s;hop of Vienna, together with Eckius, and another doctor, named Cochlaeus, to draw up a refutation of this fa|mous confe&s;&s;ion. This pretended refutation having been read publickly in the a&s;&s;embly, the emperor demanded of the prote&s;tant members that they would acquie&s;ce in it, and put an end to their religious debates by an unlimited &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion to the doctri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">es and opinions contained in this an&s;wer. But this demand was far from being complied with. The prote&s;tants declared, on the contrary, that they were by no means &s;atisfied with the reply of their adver&s;aries, and earne&s;tly de&s;ired a copy of it, that they might demon&s;trate more fully its extreme in&s;ufficiency and weakne&s;s. This rea&s;onable reque&s;t was refu&s;ed by the emperor, who, on this occa&s;ion, as well as on &s;everal others, &s;hewed more re|gard
<PB N="43" REF="035737_0042_10064EAD0984A540">to the importunity of the pope's legate and his party, than to the demands of equity, can|dour, and ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>On the 19th day of November, a &s;evere de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ree was i&s;&s;ued out, by the expre&s;s order of the emperor, during the ab&s;en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e of the chief &s;upporters of the prote&s;tant cau&s;e; and, in this decree, every thing was manife&s;tly adapted to deject the friends of religious liberty, if we ex|cept a &s;aint and dubio is promi&s;e of engaging the pope to a&s;&s;emble (in about &s;ix months after the &s;eparation of the diet) a general council.

<P>No &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oner were the elector of Saxony and the confederate princes informed of this deplo|rable i&s;&s;ue of the diet of Aug<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">burg, than they a&s;&s;embled in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rder to deliberate upon the mea|&s;ures that were proper to be taken on this
<PB N="44" REF="035737_0043_10064EAF54EB7030">critical occa&s;ion. In the year 1530, and the year following, they met, fir&s;t at &s;malcald, afterwards at Frankfort, and formed a &s;olemn alliance and confederacy, with the intention of defending vigorou&s;ly their religion and liberties again&s;t the dangers and encroachments with which they were menaced. Amid&s;t the&s;e emo|tions and preparations, which portended an approaching rupture, the elector Palatine, and the elector of Mentz, offered their mediation, and endeavoured to reconcile the contending princes.</P>
<P>Many projects of reconciliation were propo|&s;ed; and after various negociations, a treaty of peace was concluded at Nuremberg, in the year 1532, between the emperor and the pro|te&s;tant princes, on the following conditions; that the latter &s;hould furni&s;h a &s;ub&s;idy for car|rying on the war again&s;t the Turks, and ac|knowledge Ferdinand lawful king of the Ro|mans; and that the emperor, on his part, &s;hould abrogate and annul the edicts of Worms and Aug&s;burg, and allow the Lutherans the free unmole&s;ted exerci&s;e of their religious doctrine and di&s;cipline, until a rule of faith was fixed either in the free general council that was to be a&s;&s;embled in the &s;pace of &s;ix months, or in a diet of the empire.</P>
<P>The religious truce, concluded at Nurem|berg, in&s;pired with new vigour and re&s;olution all the friends of the reformation. It gave
<PB N="45" REF="035737_0044_10064EB35236CFB0">&s;trength to the feeble, and per&s;everance to the bold. Encouraged by it, tho&s;e who had been hitherto only &s;ecret enem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">es to the Roman pon|tiff, &s;purned now his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oke publicly, and refu|&s;ed to &s;ubmit to his imper<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ous juri&s;diction. This appears from the various cities and provinces in Germany, which, about this time, boldly en|li&s;ted them&s;elves under the religious &s;tandard of Luther.</P>
<P>About the beginning of the year 1527. Lu|ther was attacked by a very &s;evere illne&s;s, which brought him near to his grave. He ap|plied him&s;elf to prayer, made a confe&s;&s;ion of his faith, and lamented grievou&s;ly his on worthine&s;s of martyrdom, which he had &s;o of<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">en and &s;o ardently de&s;ired. In this &s;ituation he made a will, for he had a &s;on, and his wife was again with child, in which he recommended his fa|mily to the care of heaven: <Q>Lord God&punc; &s;ays he, I thank thee, that thou woulde&s;t have me poor on earth and a beggar. I have neither hou&s;e, nor land, nor po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, nor money, to leave. Thou ha&s;t given me a wife and children: Take them, I be&s;eech thee, under thy care and pre&s;erve them, as thou ha&s;t pre&s;erved me,</Q> He bequeathed his dete&s;tation of popery to his friends and bre|thren; agreeably to what he often u&s;ed to &s;ay, i. e. Living, I was the plague of the pope; and dying, I &s;hall be his death.</P>
<P>Luther, from about this period, having laid
<PB N="46" REF="035737_0045_10064EB4DED6B6E0">the great foundation of the reformation, was chiefly employed in rai&s;ing and completing the &s;uper&s;tructure. The remainder of his life was &s;pent, in exhorting princes, &s;tates, and univer|&s;ities, to confirm the great work, which had been brought about through him; and in pu|bli&s;hing from time to time &s;uch writings, as might encourage, direct, and a&s;&s;i&s;t them in doing it. The emperor threatened temporal puni&s;hment with armies; and the pope eternal pains with bulls and cor&s;es; but Luther, arm|ed with the intrepidity of grace, over and above his own courageous nature, regarded neither the one nor the other. His friend and a&s;&s;i&s;tant Melancthon could not be &s;o indifferent; for Melancthon had a great deal of &s;oftne&s;s, moderation and diffidence in his con&s;titution, which made him very unea&s;y and alarmed at the&s;e formidable appearances. Hence we find many of Luther's letters were written on pur|po&s;e to comfort him under the&s;e anxieties: <Q>I am (&s;ays he in one of the&s;e letters) much weaker than you in private confl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cts, if I may call tho&s;e conflicts private, which I have with the devil; but you are much weaker than me in public. You are all di&s;tru&s;t in the public cau&s;e; I, on the contrary, am very confident; becau&s;e I know it is a ju&s;t and true cau&s;e, the cau&s;e of God and of Chri&s;t, which need not tremble or be aba&s;hed. But the
<PB N="47" REF="035737_0046_10064EB66800C4B8">ca&s;e is different with me in my private con|flicts, feeling my&s;elf a mo&s;t mi&s;erable &s;inner, and therefore have great rea&s;on to lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">k pale and tremble. Upon this account it is, that I can be almo&s;t an in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ifferent &s;pectator amid&s;t all the no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;y th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e us and b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">llyings of the pa|pi&s;ts; f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r if we fall, the kingdom of Chri&s;t falls with us: And if it &s;h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">uld fall, I had rather fall with Chri&s;t than &s;tand with Cae|&s;ar." So again a little farther: "You, Melancthon, cannot bear the&s;e di&s;orders; and labour to have things tran&s;acted by rea|&s;on, and agreeably to that &s;pirit of calmne&s;s and moderation wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ch your philo&s;ophy dic|tates.

If the cau&s;e be bad, indeed, let us renounce it: But if it be good, why do we make God a liar, who hath promi&s;ed to &s;upport us? Does he make his promi&s;es to the wind, or to his people?</Q></P>
<P>Luther preached his la&s;t &s;ermon at Witten|burg on the &s;eventeenth of January, 1546; and, on the twentythird, &s;et out for I&s;leben, where he was honorable entertained by the count, who e&s;corted him to his apartments with one hundred hor&s;e. Luther attended the bu&s;ine&s;s upon which he came from the twenty-ninth
<PB N="48" REF="035737_0047_10064EB88E38DA98">of January, to the &s;eventeenth of Febru|ary, when he &s;ickened a little before &s;upper of his u&s;ual illne&s;s. This was an oppre&s;&s;ion of humors in the opening of the &s;tomach, with which Melancthon, who was with him, had &s;een him frequently afflicted. His pain increa&s;|ed, and he went to bed, were he &s;lept till mid|night, when he awaked in &s;uch angui&s;h that he found his life was near at an end. He then prayed in the&s;e words: <Q>I pray God to pre|&s;erve the doctrine of his go&s;pel among us; for the pope and the council of Trent have grievous things in hand.</Q> After which, he &s;aid, <Q>O heavenly Father, my gracious God, and Father of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, thou God of all con&s;olation, I give thee hearty thanks that thou ha&s;t revealed to me thy Son Je&s;us Chri&s;t, whom I believe, whom I profe&s;s, whom I love, whom I glorify, and whom the pope and the multitude of the wicked do per&s;ecute and di&s;honour.&mdash;I be|&s;eech thee Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, receive my &s;oul.

<PB N="49" REF="035737_0048_10064EBDAD68F830">count of Mansfield, Melancthon, Ju&s;tus Jonas, and &s;everal other friends, attended him in his la&s;t moments, joining him in prayer, that God would pre&s;erve the doctrine of his go&s;pel among them. Melancthon &s;ays of Luther, that ha|ving frequently repeated his prayers, he was called to God, <Q>unto whom he &s;o faithfully commended his &s;pirit, to enjoy, no doubt, the ble&s;&s;ed &s;ociety of the patriarchs, pro|phets, and apo&s;tles, in the kingdom of God the Father, the Son, and the Holy Gho&s;t.</Q></P>
<P>Luther died on the eighteenth of February, 1546, in the &s;ixty-fourth year of his age. A thou&s;and fables have been invented concerning his death; nor would his enemies forbear pu|bli&s;hing lies on this &s;ubject long after he had left this world. Some have &s;aid, that he died &s;uddenly; others that he killed him&s;elf; and &s;ome have impudently proceeded &s;o far as to give out that he was taken away by the devil. Nor are they people of mean figure and credit, who vent the&s;e calumnies, but the mo&s;t famous writers, as Cochlaeus, Be&s;&s;aeus, Bozius, Fabia|nus, Ju&s;tinian, and Bellarmine. This, &s;ays Bayle, reflects on the whole body of popery; for &s;uch fables ought not to pa&s;s the pre&s;s. He was honourably interred at Wittenberg.</P>
<P>Luther left a widow, three &s;ons, and two daughters. Whil&s;t the troops of Charles V. were at Wittenberg, in the year 1547, the
<PB N="50" REF="035737_0049_10064EBF373CBF40">Spaniards &s;olicited the emperor to pull down Luther's monument, and wanted to dig up his bones; But the emperor had more genero&s;ity and prudence, than to con&s;ent to a procedure &s;o ba&s;e and infamous.</P>
<P>His commentary on the epi&s;tle to the Gala|tians, was his favourite work, which he u&s;ed to call his wife, his Catharine de Bore.</P>
<P>His favourite doctrine was ju&s;tification by faith alone, and not by works, moral, legal, or evangelical: But we mu&s;t do him the ju&s;tice to ob&s;erve, that he perpetually inculcated the ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of good works. According to him, a man is ju&s;tified only by faith; but he cannot be ju&s;tified without works; and where tho&s;e works are not to be found, there is a&s;&s;u|redly no true faith.</P>
<P>It has al&s;o been &s;aid of Luther, that it was a great miracle a poor friar &s;hould be able to &s;tand again&s;t the pope: It was a greater that he &s;hould prevail: And the greate&s;t of all that he died in peace, as well as Era&s;mus, when &s;ur|rounded by &s;o many enemies.</P>
<P>The doctrine of this eminent divine, and great reformer; was &s;oon extended through all Germany, Denmark, Sweden, England, and other countries, under different modifica|tions.</P>
<P>Luther's works were collected after his death, and printed at Wittenberg in &s;even volumes folio.</P>

Our &s;erious readers will, perhaps, be plea&s;ed with the in&s;ertion of &s;ome remarkable &s;ayings and ob&s;ervations of this great man. Era&s;mus confe&s;&s;ed, <Q>that there more &s;olid divinity con|tained in one leaf of Luther's commentaries, than could be found in many prolix treati&s;es of &s;choolmen, and &s;uch kind of authors.</Q> Speaking of the pope's u&s;ing the ma&s;s for de|parted &s;ouls, Luther ob&s;erved, that <Q>he with his ma&s;s was not &s;atisfied to thru&s;t him&s;elf into all corners of the earth, but he mu&s;t needs go tumbling down into the very bo&s;om of hell.</Q></P>
<P>He u&s;ed to call the indulgence-merchants, <HI>pur&s;e thre&s;hers.</HI></P>
<P>There were many plots laid again&s;t his life, which the bloody papi&s;ts &s;ought after by all means. Poi&s;en, daggers, pi&s;tols, were inten|ded; when fire and faggot could not be u&s;ed, through the elector's protection. A Poli&s;h Jew was hired for 2000 crowns to poi&s;on him. <Q>The plot (&s;ays Luther) was di&s;covered to me by the letters of my friends. He is a doctor of phy&s;ic, and dares to attempt any thing; He would go about this bu&s;ine&s;s with incredible craft and agility. He is ju&s;t now apprehended.</Q>&mdash;However, God pre&s;erved him from the malice of his enemies. It &s;hews, however, what papi&s;ts can attempt (&s;ays Mel|chior Adam); and if we wanted further proof of it, the words of Alexander, the pope's legate,
<PB N="52" REF="035737_0051_10064EC260491748">are &s;ufficient. <Q>Though you Germans (&s;aid he), who pay the lea&s;t of all people to the Roman &s;ee, have &s;haken of the pope's yoke; yet we will take care, that ye &s;hall be de|voured with civil wars, and peri&s;h in your own blood.</Q>&mdash;A pious re&s;olution indeed!</P>
<P>When Luther's bold manner of expre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf was cen&s;ured, he replied; <Q>Almo&s;t all men condemn my tartne&s;s of expre&s;&s;ion; but I am of your opinion, (&s;ays he to his friend) that God will have the deceits of men thus powerfully expo&s;ed. For I plainly per|ceive, that tho&s;e things, which are &s;oftly dealt with in our corrupt age, give people but light concern, and are pre&s;ently forgot|ten.&mdash;If I have exceeded the bounds of mo|deration, the mon&s;trous turpitude of the times has tran&s;ported me. Nor do I tran&s;cend the example of Chri&s;t, who, having to do with men of like manners, called them &s;harply by their own proper names, &s;uch as, <HI>an adulte|rous and perver&s;e generation, a brood of vi|pers, hypocrites, children of the devil, who could not e&s;cape the damnation of hell.</HI></Q>&mdash;Era&s;mus, with all his refinement, could own, <Q>That God had &s;ent in Luther a &s;harp phy&s;ci|an, in con&s;ideration of the immen&s;ity of the di&s;ea&s;es, which had infected this la&s;t age of the world.</Q></P>
<P>Luther cau&s;ed the P&s;alms, u&s;ed in wor&s;hip, to be tran&s;lated into German. <Q>We intend

Upon this account, we &s;eek for &s;ome poets: And as you po&s;&s;e&s;s the copiou&s;ne&s;s and elegenoe of the German, which you have greatly cultivated; I would reque&s;t your a&s;&s;i&s;tance in this bu&s;ine&s;s.

<P>He u&s;ed to &s;ay of him&s;elf and the other mini|&s;ters; <Q>We are only planters and waterers, in admini&s;tering the word and &s;acrament; but the increa&s;e is not in our power.</Q></P>

<P>With regard to human learning, he thus expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf; <Q>I am per&s;uaded, that true divinity could not well be &s;upported without the knowledge of letters: Of this we have &s;ad proof, for while learning was decay|ed and in ruins, theology fell too, and lay mo&s;t wretchedly ob&s;cured. I am &s;ure, that the revelation and manife&s;tation of the word of God would never have been &s;o exten&s;ive and glorious as it is, if preparitorily, like &s;o many John Bapti&s;ts &s;moothing the way, the knowledge of lan|guages and good learning had not ri&s;en <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">p among us.&mdash;They are mo&s;t exceedingly mi&s;taken, who imagine, that the knowledge of nature and true philo&s;ophy is of no u&s;e to a divine.</Q></P>
<P>He advi&s;ed, in the ca&s;e of temptations, in this manner; <Q>I would comfort tho&s;e, that are tried in their faith and hope towards God, in this way; fir&s;t, let them avoid &s;olitarine&s;s, keep always in good company, &s;ing the p&s;almns, and conver&s;e upon the holy &s;crip|tures. Secondly, Though it be the mo&s;t difficult point to work upon the mind, yet it is the mo&s;t pre&s;ent remedy, if they can, through grace, per&s;uade them&s;elves, that the&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">evous thoughts are not their own, but Satan's; and that, therefore, they
<PB N="55" REF="035737_0054_10064ECB84E37318">&s;hould earne&s;tly endeavour to turn the heart to other objects, and quit the&s;e evil &s;ugge&s;|tions: For to dwell upon them, or fight with them, or to a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">m to overcome them, or to wait for an end of them; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s only to irri|tate and &s;trengthen them, even to perdition, without relief.</Q></P>
<P>Luther frequently &s;aid; <Q>That a preacher &s;hould take care not to bring three little &s;ly d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">gs<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">int<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> his profe&s;&s;ion; viz.

<P>In private life, Luther was an example of the &s;tricte&s;t virtue. At dinner or &s;upper, he would often dictate matter of preaching to others, or correct the pre&s;s; and &s;ometimes amu&s;e him&s;elf with mu&s;ic, in which he took great delight. Though a large man, he was a very moderate eater and drinker, and not at all delicate in his appetite, for he u&s;ually fed upon he &s;imple&s;t diet. He much delighted in his
<PB N="56" REF="035737_0055_10064ECD4761C540">garden, and was very fond of cultivating it with all kinds of plants. In &s;hort he was never idle.</P>
<P>Though he had not much him&s;elf, he very freely be&s;towed of what he had upon others. A poor &s;tudent, a&s;king money of him, he de&s;i|red his wife to give &s;ome, who excu&s;ing her&s;elf on account of their poverty; he took up a &s;ilver cup and gave it to the &s;cholar, bidding him to &s;ell it to the gold&s;mith, and keep the money f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r his occa&s;ions. When a friend &s;ent him two hundred pieces of gold, he be&s;towed them all on poor &s;cholars. And when the elector gave him a new gown, he wrote in an&s;wer, <Q>That too much was done; for if we receive all in this life, we &s;hall have nothing to hope for in the next.</Q> He took nothing of printers, for his works, to his own u&s;e, &s;aying, <Q>'Tis true I have no money, but am indeed poor; yet I deal in this moderate manner with printers, and take nothing from them for my variety of labours, except &s;ometimes a copy or two.</Q> This, I believe, may be due to me, when other authors, even tran&s;lators, "for every &s;heet have their &s;tipulated price." When he had &s;ome money &s;ent him, he wrote thus to a friend: <Q>I have received by Tauben|heim an hundred pieces of gold; and at the &s;ame time Schart has &s;ent me fifty; &s;o that I begin to fear, le&s;t God &s;hould give me my portion here. But I &s;olemnly prote&s;t, that
<PB N="57" REF="035737_0056_10064ECED2334570">I would not be &s;atisfied from HIM: I will either pre&s;ently return, or get rid of them. For what is &s;o much money to me? I have given half of it to Prior, and made him very happy.</Q></P>
<P>He had great tenderne&s;s for his family. When he &s;aw Magdalen his elde&s;t daughter at the point of death, he read to her this pa&s;&s;age from the xxvith of I&s;aiah: <HI>Thy dead man &s;hall live together with my dead body &s;hall they ari&s;e: Awake and &s;ing, ye that dwell in the du&s;t; for thy dew is as the dew of herbs, and the earth &s;hall ca&s;t out the dead. Come, my peo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">le, enter thou into thy chambers and &s;hut thy doors about thee: Hide thy&s;elf as it were for a little moment, until the indignation be overpa&s;t.</HI><Q>My daugh|ter, do thou enter (&s;ays he) into thy cham|ber with peace: I &s;hall &s;oon be with thee; for God will not permit me to &s;ee the judg|ments, that hang over Germany.</Q> And upon this he poured forth a flood of tears. Yet afterwards, when he attended the funeral, he contained him&s;elf, &s;o as not to appear to weep.</P>
<P>Being once a&s;ked, <HI>Whether we &s;hould know each other in heaven?</HI> he an&s;wered; <Q>How was it with Adam? He had never &s;een Eve; for when God formed her, he was in a deep &s;leep, yet when he a waked and &s;aw her, he did not a&s;k, Who &s;he was? or from whence &s;he came? but immediately &s;aid, that &s;he

Being filled with the Holy Spirit, and endued with the true knowledge of God, he was able to de|termine upon the nat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">re of things.&mdash;In like manner, we &s;hall be perfectly renewed here|after through Chri&s;t; and &s;hall know, with far greater perfection than can be conceived of here, our deare&s;t relations, and indeed whatever exi&s;ts; and in a mode, too, much &s;uper<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">or t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Adam <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> paradi&s;e.</Q></P>
<P>If we would know what was the ground of this wonderful man's magna<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">y, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t cannot be better expre&s;&s;ed than it is by him&s;elf in a letter to Spala<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ia<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s, during the diet of Aug&s;burg; <Q>That kings, and princes, and people, (&s;ays he) rage again&s;t Chri&s;t, the Lord's annoint|ed, I e&s;teem a go<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d &s;ign, and a much better one than <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">f they flattered. For it follows upon this, that he, who dwelleth in hea|ven, laughs them to &s;corn. And if our head laugh, I &s;ee no rea&s;on why we &s;hould weep before the faces of &s;uch beings. He does not laugh for his own &s;ake, but for our's, that we, putting the more tr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">t in h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n, might de&s;pi&s;e their empty de&s;igns; of &s;o great need is faith, that the cau&s;e and ground of it is not to be perceived without faith.

He al&s;o, I make no doubt, will carry on and complete the &s;ame, without and above all our conceptions and cares. I know and am a&s;&s;ured of this, for I re&s;t the whole upon him, who is able to do above all that we can a&s;k or think. Yet our friend Philip Melanc|thon will contrive and de&s;ire, that God &s;hould work according to and within the compa&s;s of his puny notions, that he may have &s;omewhat whereof to glory.

<P>Luther's memorable prote&s;tation, upon the article of ju&s;tification, mu&s;t not be omitted, and with it we &s;hall clo&s;e this account of his life. <Q>I, Martin Luther, an unworthy preacher of the go&s;pel of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, thus profe&s;s and thus believe; that this article, THAT FAITH ALONE WITHOUT WORKS, CAN JUSTIFY BEFORE GOD, &s;hall never be overthrown neither by the emperor, nor by the Turk, nor by the Tartar, nor by the Per&s;ian, nor by the pope, with all his car|dinals, bi&s;hops, &s;acrificers, monks, nuns, kings, princes, powers of the world, nor yet by all the devils in hell. This article &s;hall &s;tand fa&s;t, whether they will or no. This is the true go&s;pel. Je&s;us Chri&s;t redeem|ed us from our &s;ins, and he only. This mo&s;t firm and certain truth is the voice of &s;cripture, though the world and all the de|vils rage and roar. If Chri&s;t alone take
<PB N="61" REF="035737_0060_10064ED545126A88">away our &s;ins, we cannot do this with our works; and as it is impo&s;&s;ible to embrace Chri&s;t but by faith, it is, therefore, equally impo&s;&s;ible to apprehend him by works.

<HEAD>JOHN CALVIN, THE EVANGELIC REFORMER.</HEAD>
<P>THIS eminent reformer was born, on the tenth of July, 1509, at Noyon, a city of France. His parents enjoyed a decent for|tune, and be&s;towed on him a liberal education. In all the branches of literature then known, his &s;tudies were attended with the mo&s;t amazing and rapid &s;ucce&s;s. He was originally de&s;igned for the church, and had actually obtained a benefice; but the light that broke in upon his religious &s;entiments, as well as the preference given by his father to the profe&s;&s;ion of the law, induced him to give up his eccle&s;ia&s;tical vocati|on, which he afterwards re&s;umed in a purer church.</P>
<P>Calvin made great progre&s;s in the civil law; and pur&s;ued his private &s;tudies in the holy Scriptures with equal &s;ucce&s;s. He was incited to the latter by Melchior Wolmar, who was profe&s;&s;or of Greek at Bourges, and &s;ecretly a Lutheran.</P>
<P>While Calvin was &s;tudying the civil law at Bourges, he preached &s;everal &s;ermons in a neighbouring town called Live<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ta: But his father died in 1533; on which account he re|turned
<PB N="63" REF="035737_0062_10064EDB74B06B28">to Paris, in the twenty-third year of his age, with a re&s;olution to make divinity his principal &s;tudy. Soon after he came back to Paris, he became acquainted with all tho&s;e who profe&s;&s;ed the reformed religion; and about this time, he embraced the doctrine of the reformers, and began publickly to teach it.</P>
<P>Calvin was e&s;teemed in the French congrega|tions, as one of the mo&s;t able and be&s;t qualified men to teach and defend the doctrine of the reformation, which had been introduced into that kingdom. His zeal expo&s;ed him to various perils, and the connexion he had formed with the friends of the reformation, whom Francis I. was daily committing to the flames, placed him more than once in imminent danger, from which he was delivered by the good offices of the queen of Navarre. To e&s;cape the impend|ing &s;torms he returned to Ba&s;il, where he publi&s;hed his <HI>Chri&s;tian In&s;titutions;</HI> and prefix|ed to them that famous dedication to Francis I. which has attracted the admiration of &s;ucceeding ages, and which was intended to &s;often the fury of that prince again&s;t the prote&s;tants. The In&s;titution are a body of divinity, containing the doctrines of the Chri&s;tian religion, in a di&s;tinct and ea&s;y method. It was publi&s;hed in 1535, and afterwards tran&s;lated into almo&s;t all the languages of Europe.</P>
<P>When Calvin had publi&s;hed this book, he made a journey into Italy, to wait on the duch|e&s;s
<PB N="64" REF="035737_0063_10064EDD043DA5C8">of Ferrara, the daughter of Lewis XII. She was a prince&s;s of exemplary piety, and a favourer of the reformation. Calvin met with a very gracious reception from her: But the duke of Ferrara would not &s;uffer him to conti|nue long with his duche&s;s; and he returned into France, to &s;ettle his affairs in that kingdom, from whence he prepared to &s;et out for Stra&s;|burgh, or Ba&s;il.</P>
<P>The war had left no other pa&s;&s;age, but through the duke of Savoy's dominions, which obliged them to take that cour&s;e. This &s;eemed a particular direction of Providence, that de|&s;igned him for Geneva, where he was kindly entertained by William Farel, who detained him there, as it were, by an order from a|bove.</P>
<P>Farel was a man of a truly heroic &s;pirit, and u&s;ed a great many arguments to prevail with Calvin to &s;tay and a&s;&s;i&s;t him at Geneva, rather than proceed any farther. Calvin was unwilling to continue there, till Farel &s;aid to him, <Q>Be|hold, I declare to you, in the name of Almigh|ty God, that unle&s;s you will here become fel|low-labourer in the work of the Lord, his cur&s;e will be upon you, for &s;eeking your&s;elf rather than Chri&s;t.</Q> Peter Viret &s;econded Farel, and Calvin then &s;ubmitted to the judg|ment of the pre&s;bytery and magi&s;trates; by who&s;e &s;uffrages, together with the con&s;ent of the people, he was cho&s;en preacher, and
<PB N="65" REF="035737_0064_10064EDEB82379A8">divinity profe&s;&s;or. He complied with the latter, and would have declined the former; but he was obliged to undertake both functions Cal|vin afterwards called Farel his <Q>fellow-labour|er, to whom the Geneve&s;e owed even them|&s;elves; that he was the father of their liberty; and the founder of their church.</Q></P>
<P>Hooker has given a full character of Calvin, as head of the Genevan di&s;cipline. <Q>A founder it had, whom for mine own part, I think in|comparably the wi&s;e&s;t man that ever the French church did enjoy, &s;ince it enjoyed him. His bringing up was in the &s;tudy of the civil law. Divine knowledge he gather|ed not by hearing or reading &s;o much, as by teaching others: For though thou&s;ands were debtors to him, as touching knowledge in that kind; yet he to none, but only to God, the author of that ble&s;&s;ed fountain, the book of life; and of the admirable dexterity of wit, together with the helps of other learning, which were his guides; till being occa&s;ioned to leave France; he fell at length upon Geneva, which city the bi&s;hop and clergy thereof had a little before for&s;aken, as &s;ome do affirm; being of likelihood frighted with the people's &s;udden attempt, for the aboli&s;hment of the popi&s;h religion. At the coming of Calvin thither, the form of their civil regimen was popular, as it continueth to this day; neither king, nor duke, nor
<PB N="66" REF="035737_0065_10064EE1814CDED8">noblemen, of any authority or power over them; but officers cho&s;en by the people, yearly out of them&s;elves, to order all things with public con&s;ent. For &s;piritual govern|ment they had no laws at all agreed upon; but did what the pa&s;tors of their &s;ouls by per&s;ua&s;ion could win them unto. Calvin con&s;idered how dangerous it was, that the whole e&s;tate of that church &s;hould hang &s;till on &s;o &s;lender a thread, as the liking of an ignorant multitude, if it have power to change what&s;oever it&s;elf liketh. Wherefore taking unto him two of the other mini|&s;ters for more countenance of the action, albeit the re&s;t were all again&s;t it, they moved and per&s;uaded the people to bind them&s;elves by &s;olemn oath, <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> never to admit the papacy among&s;t them again: and, <HI>&s;econdly,</HI> to live in obedience unto &s;uch orders, concern|ing the exerci&s;e of their religion, and the form of their eccle&s;ia&s;tical government, as tho&s;e their true and faithful mini&s;ters of God's word, had, agreeable to Scripture, &s;et down to that end and purpo&s;e,</Q> Hence it appears, how extremely fal&s;e and unju&s;t the exclamati|ons of the papi&s;ts again&s;t Calvin are, that he &s;ubverted the government, and turned the &s;tate of Geneva into confu&s;ion; whereas the truth is, the bi&s;hop of Geneva who, like &s;ome other prince-bi&s;hops in Germany, claimed the office of ruler, was expelled long before Calvin's
<PB N="67" REF="035737_0066_10064EE49920C8F8">arrival; and as the government was modelled into its democratic form, previous to his re&s;i|dence, he did not believe that he had any divine authority to alter the civil con&s;titution, if it had been in his power.</P>
<P>This reformation of doctrines had not remo|ved that corruption of manners which had prevailed in Geneva; nor that factious &s;pirit which had &s;o much divided the principal families. Therefore Calvin, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by his colleagues Farel and Caroldus, declared, that as all there remon|&s;trances had proved ineffectuall, they could not celebrate the holy &s;acrament while tho&s;e di&s;or|ders continued. They al&s;o agreed, that they would no longer &s;ubmit to the con&s;titutions that the &s;ynod of Bern had made; and they de&s;ired to be heard in the &s;ynod which was to be held at Zurick.</P>
<P>The church of Geneva made u&s;e of leavened bread in the communion; they had removed the bapti&s;mal fonts out of the churches; and aboli&s;hed all fe&s;tivals except Sundays. But the churches of the canton of Bern di&s;approved of the&s;e three things; and, by an act made in the &s;ynod of Lau&s;anne, required that the u&s;e of unleavened bread, the bapti&s;mal fonts, and the fe&s;tivals &s;hould be re-e&s;tabli&s;hed in Geneva. The&s;e were the regulations with which Calvin refu&s;ed to comply.</P>
<P>The &s;yndics of Geneva &s;ummoned the people in 1538; and Calvin, Farel, and Courant,
<PB N="68" REF="035737_0067_10064EE624A99EC0">pre&s;ented them&s;elves before the council, offer|ing to make good their confe&s;&s;ion of faith. The Syndics favoured the di&s;contented party, and were catholics in their hearts. The coun|cil, under pretence of pre&s;erving the liberties and privileges of the city; and becau&s;e Calvin and his friends would not conform to the cu&s;tom of Bern in celebrating the communion, made an order to enjoin tho&s;e three members to leave the city in three days. When this decree was brought to Calvin he &s;aid, <Q>Truly, if I had &s;erved men, I &s;hould have had an ill reward: But it is well that I have &s;erved him, who doth always perform to his &s;ervants what he hath once promi&s;ed.</Q></P>
<P>Calvin had no maintainance from the city, and lived at his own expence. He went to Ba&s;il, and from thence to Stra&s;burgh, where Bucer and Capito gave him every mark of their e&s;teem. He was al&s;o care&s;&s;ed by Hedio, and other learned men, who procured him permi&s;&s;ion from the magi&s;trates to &s;et up a French church, of which he became the pa&s;tor, and had a com|petant maintainance allowed him there. He was al&s;o made profe&s;&s;or of divinity.</P>
<P>While Calvin was ab&s;ent from Geneva, car|dinal Sadolet wrote an eloquent letter to the inhabitants of that city, to exhort them to re|turn into the bo&s;om of the Romi&s;h church. Calvin an&s;wered that letter in 1539; in which he manife&s;ted his affection for the church of
<PB N="69" REF="035737_0068_10064EE847AD0EB0">Geneva, and di&s;appointed the views which the bi&s;hop of Carpentras had entertained in his fine artful letter to that &s;tate.</P>
<P>The time was now come for e&s;tabli&s;hing the church at Geneva, by recalling Calvin^. The Syndics who had promoted the decree of bani&s;h|ment were dead or bani&s;hed; and the people were not before &s;o willing to be rid of their learned pa&s;tor, as now importunate to obtain him again from them who had given him entertainment, and were unwilling to part with him, if irre&s;i&s;tible &s;olicitations had not been u&s;ed.</P>
<P>One of the town mini&s;ters, who &s;aw in what manner the people were inclined for the recall|ing of Calvin, gave him notice of their affection in this &s;ort. <Q>The &s;enate of two hundred be|ing a&s;&s;embled, they all de&s;ire Calvin. The next day a general convocation; they all cry, we will have Calvin, that good and learned man, the mini&s;ter of Chri&s;t.</Q> When Calvin under&s;tood this he prai&s;ed GOD; and judged it was the call of heaven. He &s;aid, <HI>It is marvellous in our eyes; for the &s;tone which the builders refu&s;ed, was made the head of the corner.</HI> In his ab&s;ence, he had per&s;uaded them, with whom he was able to prevail, that though he more approved of common bread to be u&s;ed in the euchari&s;t; yet they &s;hould rather accept the other, than cau&s;e any trouble in the church about it.</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="035737_0069_10064EECCBC95D50">
The people &s;aw that the name of Calvin in|crea&s;ed every day greater abroad; and that with his &s;ame, their infamy was &s;pread, who had ejected him with &s;uch ra&s;hne&s;s and folly.</P>
<P>He re-entered Geneva, (leaving Brulius to &s;ucceed him in the French church at Stra&s;burgh) on the thirteenth of September, 1541, to the infinite &s;atisfaction of the people and magi&s;tra|cy; and the fir&s;t thing he did was to e&s;tabli&s;h a form of di&s;cipline, and a con&s;i&s;torial juri&s;diction, with power to exerci&s;e canonical cen&s;ures and puni&s;hments, even to excommunication. This di&s;plea&s;ed many, who urged, that it was re&s;to|ring the Roman tyranny: However, the thing was executed; and this new cannon pa&s;&s;ed into a law, in a general a&s;&s;embly of the people, on the twentieth of November, 1541.</P>
<P>He rightly con&s;idered how gro&s;s a thing it was for men of his quality, wi&s;e and grave men, to live with &s;uch a multitude, and to be tenants at will under them, as their mini&s;ters, both him&s;elf and others, had been. For the remedy of this inconvenience, he gave them plainly to under&s;tand, that if he became their teacher again, they mu&s;t be content to admit a com|plete form of di&s;cipline, which both they, and al&s;o their pa&s;tors, &s;hould be &s;olemnly &s;wore to ob&s;erve for ever after. Of which di&s;cipline the principal parts were the&s;e: A &s;tanding eccle&s;i|a&s;tical court to be e&s;tabli&s;hed: perpetual judges in that court to be their mini&s;ters, others of the
<PB N="71" REF="035737_0070_10064EEE53F9D0B8">people annually cho&s;en, twice &s;o many in num|ber as they, to be judges together with them in the &s;ame court: The&s;e two &s;orts to have the care of all men's manners, power of deter|mining all kind of eccle&s;ia&s;tical cau&s;es, and authority to convent, control, and puni&s;h, as far as with excommunication, whoever they &s;hould think worthy, none, either &s;mall or great, excepted.</P>
<P>Both the clergy and laity of Geneva engaged them&s;elves to a perpetual ob&s;ervance of the new in&s;titution made by Calvin, who&s;e inflexible &s;everity, in maintaining the rights of his con|&s;i&s;tory, rai&s;ed him a great many enemies, and occa&s;ioned &s;ome di&s;orders in the city. Howe|ver, he &s;urmounted all oppo&s;ition, and al&s;o governed the prote&s;tants in France, who al|mo&s;t all held the doctrine of Calvin, and recei|ved mini&s;ters from Geneva, who pre&s;ided in their congregations.</P>
<P>Of all the undertakings of Calvin, there was none that involved him in &s;o much trouble, or expo&s;ed him to &s;uch imminent danger, as the plan he had formed, with &s;uch re&s;olution and fortitude, of purging the church by the exclu&s;ion of ob&s;tinate and &s;candalous offenders, and inflicting &s;evere puni&s;hments on all &s;uch as violated the laws, enacted by the church, or by the Con&s;i&s;tory, which was its repre&s;enta|tive. The party at Geneva, which Calvin cal|led the &s;ect of Libertines (becau&s;e they defended
<PB N="72" REF="035737_0071_10064EEFDE8A9A80">the licentious cu&s;toms of ancient times, the erection of &s;lews, and &s;uch like matters, not only by their di&s;cour&s;e and their actions, but even by force of arms), was both numerous and powerful. But the courage and re&s;olution of this great reformer gained the a&s;cendant, and triumphed over the oppo&s;ition of his ene|mies.</P>
<P>Dupin &s;ays, <Q>The doctrine of Calvin con|cerning the &s;acrament, is not fundamentally different from that of the Zuing lians; though he u&s;es very po&s;itive words to expre&s;s the pre&s;ence of the body and blood of Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</Q> The expre&s;&s;ions which are in Calvin's in&s;tituti|ons, and his other writings, might make us believe, that he did not deny the real and &s;ub|&s;tantial pre&s;ence of the body and blood of Chri&s;t in the euchari&s;t: Yet, in other places, he clearly rejects not only tran&s;ub&s;tantiation, but al&s;o his real pre&s;ence; by a&s;&s;erting, that the body of Je&s;us Chri&s;t is really and &s;ub&s;tanti|ally pre&s;ent only in heaven; and that it is united to us only by faith, after a &s;piritual manner, by the incomprehen&s;ible working of the Holy Spirit, which joins things together that are &s;eparated by di&s;tance of place. The&s;e words, <HI>this is my body,</HI> ought to be under&s;tood after a figurative manner, according to his notion; and the &s;ign is there put for the thing &s;ignified, as when it is &s;aid, <Q>The rock is Chri&s;t; the lamb is the pa&s;&s;over; and
<PB N="73" REF="035737_0072_10064EF16E2BA038">circumci&s;ion is the covenant.</Q> The body and blood of Je&s;us Chri&s;t are united to us only by virtue and efficacy; and his flesh, remaining in heaven, infu&s;es life into us from his &s;ub&s;tance: La&s;tly, though the &s;ub&s;tance of the body and blood of Je&s;us Chri&s;t are communicated to us by the &s;acrament of the euchari&s;t, they are not really and &s;ub&s;tantially pre&s;ent there: And though the body and blood of Chri&s;t are there pre&s;ented, and offered to all chri&s;tians, they are not really received, except by the truly faithful, and not by the unworthy.</P>
<P>Calvin differed not &s;o much from Luther in other points of doctrine. He held the &s;ame principles as to imputed righteou&s;ne&s;s, and the certainty of our ju&s;tification, which he exten|ded to an a&s;&s;urance of eternal &s;alvation. He al&s;o added an impo&s;&s;ibility of falling finally from grace; and he a&s;&s;erted the &s;alvation of the chil|dren of believers who die before they have been baptized. He likewi&s;e condemned with more &s;everity than the Lutherians, the invocation of &s;aints; the wor&s;hip and u&s;e of images; vows; celibacy of prie&s;ts; fa&s;ting; holy-days; &s;acri|fice of the ma&s;s; adoration of the euchari&s;t; in|dulgencies; the &s;acraments, except the eucha|ri&s;t and bapti&s;m; and, in general, all the rites and ceremonies of the church, which the Lu|therians had not entirely aboli&s;hed.</P>
<P>The views and projects of this great man were grand and exten&s;ive. For he not only under|took
<PB N="74" REF="035737_0073_10064EF44963B3A8">to give &s;trength and vigour to the ri&s;ing church, by framing the wi&s;e&s;t laws and the mo&s;t &s;alutary in&s;titutions for the maintenance of or|der and the advancement of true piety' but e|ven propo&s;ed to render Geneva the mother, the &s;eminary of all the reformed churches, as Wit|tenberg was of all the Lutheran communities. He laid a &s;cheme for &s;ending forth from this little republic, the &s;uccours and mini&s;ters that were to promote and propagate the prote&s;tant cau&s;e through the mo&s;t di&s;tant nations, and aimed at nothing le&s;s than rendering the gover|ment, di&s;cipline, and doctrine of Geneva the model and rule of imitation to the reformed churches throughout the world. The under|taking was certainly great, and worthy of the exten&s;ive genious and capacity of this emmi|nent man; and, great and arduous as it was, it was executed in part, nay, carried on to a ve|ry con&s;iderable length, by his indefatigable a&s;|&s;iduity and inextingui&s;hable zeal. It was with this view, that, by the fame of his learning, as well as by his epi&s;tolary &s;olicitations and en|couragements of various kinds, he engaged ma|ny per&s;ons of rank and fortune, in France, Italy, and other countries, to leave the places of their nativity, and to &s;ettle at Geneva; while others repaired thither merely out of cu|rio&s;ity to &s;ee a man, who&s;e talents and exploits had rendered him &s;o famous, and to hear the di&s;cour&s;es which he delivered in public. Ano|ther
<PB N="75" REF="035737_0074_10064EF769ED3B08">circum&s;tance, that contributed much to the &s;ucce&s;s of his de&s;igns, was the e&s;tabli&s;hment of an academy at Geneva, which the &s;enate of that city founded at his reque&s;t; and in which be him&s;elf, with his colleague. Theodore Be|za, and other divines of emminent learning and abilities, taught the &s;ciences with the greate&s;t reputation. In effect, the lu&s;tre which the&s;e great men reflected upon this infant &s;eminary of learning, &s;pread its fame through the di&s;tant nations with &s;uch amazing rapidity, that all who were ambitious of a di&s;tingui&s;hed progre&s;s in either &s;acred or profane erudition, repaired to Geneva, and that England, Scotland, France, Italy, and Germany, &s;eemed to vie with each other in the numbers of their &s;tudious youth, that were ince&s;&s;antly repairing to the new aca|demy. By the&s;e means, and by the mini&s;try of the&s;e his di&s;ciples. Calvin enlarged con&s;ide|rably the borders of the reformed church, pro|pagated his doctrine, and gained pro&s;elytes and patrons to his theological &s;y&s;tem, in &s;everal countries of Europe.</P>
<P>Calvin reduced the power of the magi&s;trate, in religious matters, within narrow bounds. He declared the church a &s;eparate and indepen|dent body, endowed with the power of legi&s;la|tion for it&s;elf. He maintained, that it was to be governed, like the primitive church, only <HI>pre&s;hyteries</HI> and <HI>&s;ynods,</HI> that is, by a&s;&s;emblies of elders, compo&s;ed both of the l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rgy and laity;
<PB N="76" REF="035737_0075_10064EF8F931CCC8">and he le&s;t to the civil magi&s;trate little el&s;e than the priviledge of protecting and defending the church, and providing for what related to its external exigencies and concerns. Thus this emminent reformer introduced into the republic of Geneva, and endeavoured to introduce into all the reformed churches throughout Europe, that form of eccle&s;ia&s;tical government, which is called <HI>Pre&s;byterian,</HI> from its neither admit|ting of the in&s;titution of bi&s;hops, nor of any &s;ubordination among the clergy; and which is founded on this principle, that all mini&s;ters of the go&s;pel are, by the law of God, declared to be equal in rank and authority. In con&s;e|quence of this principle, he e&s;tabli&s;hed at Ge|neva a <HI>con&s;i&s;tory,</HI> compo&s;ed of <HI>ruling elders,</HI> partly <HI>pa&s;tors,</HI> and partly <HI>laymen,</HI> and inve&s;t|ed this eccle&s;ia&s;tical body with a high degree of power and authority. He al&s;o convened &s;y|nods, compo&s;ed of the ruling elders of different churches, and in the&s;e con&s;i&s;tories and &s;ynods had laws enacted for the regulation of all mat|ters of a religious nature; and among other things, re&s;tored to its former vigour the anci|ent practi&s;e of <HI>excommunication.</HI> All the&s;e things were done with the con&s;ent of the greate&s;t part of the &s;enate of Geneva.</P>
<P>The ab&s;olute decree of God, with re&s;pect to the future and everla&s;ting condition of the hu|man race, was an e&s;&s;ential tenet in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">reed of Calvin, who inculcated with zeal the fol|lowing
<PB N="77" REF="035737_0076_10064EFAE2C3B050">doctrine: <HI>That God in prede&s;tinating, from all eternity, one part of mankind to ever|la&s;ting happine&s;s, and another to endle&s;s mi&s;ery, was led to make this di&s;tinction by no other mo|tives than his own</HI> GOOD PLEASURE <HI>and</HI> FREE WILL.</P>
<P>Calvin was intimidated at nothing, and &s;et|tled the peace of Geneva. It would be difficult to believe, that in the mid&s;t of violent agitations at home, he could &s;hew &s;o much care, as he did, of the churches abroad, in France, England, Germany, and Poland; and write &s;o many books and letters. But there are inconte&s;table proofs of it; for he lived in continual action, and almo&s;t con&s;tantly with his pen in his hand, e|ven when &s;ickne&s;s confined him to his bed; ari|&s;ing from his zeal for the general good of the churches. He was a man on whom God had confered extraordinary talents, a great deal of wit, an exqui&s;ite judgment, a faithful memo|ry, an able, indefatigable, and elegant pen; an exten&s;ive knowledge, and a great zeal for the truth. But he could not e&s;cape &s;lander abroad, nor oppo&s;ition at home.</P>
<P>He was full thirty years old when he mar|ried Idolette de Bure, the widow of John Stor|deur, a native of Liege, and an Anabapti&s;t, whom he had converted.</P>
<P>As the reformers married to prove their con|ver&s;ion from the papi&s;ts, the latter reproached them, as if they warred again&s;t Rome for the

For notwith&s;tanding I was at liberty to have married under the tyranny of the pope, I voluntarily led a &s;ingle life for many years.</Q></P>
<P>The ordinary labours of Calvin were the&s;e. Every other &s;abbath he preached twice. Mon|day, Tue&s;day, and Wedne&s;day, he read his divinity lectures. Thur&s;day he a&s;&s;i&s;ted in the con&s;i&s;tory for the exerci&s;e of eccle&s;ia&s;tical di&s;cipline. On Friday he read a lecture in ex|po&s;ition of &s;ome difficult places in &s;cripture: Be&s;ides his public writings, and private nego|ciations. God &s;o ble&s;&s;ed his mini&s;try that he was applied and re&s;orted to from all parts of the chri&s;tian world; &s;ome to con&s;ult his advice in matters of religion, and others to hear him preach. This filled the city of Geneva with a great concour&s;e of people: and be&s;ides the e&s;ta|bli&s;hed church, there were al&s;o churches for the Engli&s;h, Spaniards, and Italians.</P>

This odious &s;ect which a&s;&s;umed the denomina|tions of libertines and Spiritual Brethren and &s;i&s;ters, aro&s;e in Flanders, was headed by Poc|ke&s;ius, Ruffus, and Quintin, got a certain foot|ing in France through the favour and protection of Margarett, queen of Navarre, and &s;i&s;ter to Francis I. and found patrons in &s;everal of the reformed churches. Their doctrine, as far as it can be known by the writings of Calvin and its other antagoni&s;ts (for the&s;e fanatics publi&s;hed no account of their tenets that is come to my knowledge), amounted to the following pro|po&s;itions: "That the deity was the &s;ole <HI>opera|ting cau&s;e</HI> in the mind of man, and the imme|diate <Q><HI>author</HI> of all human actions; that, con&s;equently, the di&s;tinction of <HI>good</HI> and <HI>evil,</HI> that had been e&s;tabli&s;hed with re&s;pect to the&s;e actions, were fal&s;e and groundle&s;s, and that men could nor, properly &s;peaking, com|mit &s;in; that religion con&s;i&s;ted in the union of the &s;pirit, or rational &s;oul, with the &s;u|preme Being; that all tho&s;e who had attained this happy union, by &s;ublime contem|plation and elevation of mind, were then allowed to indulge, without exception or re&s;traint, their appetites and pa&s;&s;ions: that all their actions and pur&s;uits were then in|nocent? and that, after the death of the bo|dy, they were to be united to the Deity.</Q></P>
<P>We mu&s;t not confound, as is frequently done,
<PB N="80" REF="035737_0079_10064F0296454370">with the&s;e fanatics, another kind of Libertines, whom Calvin had to combat, and who gave him much trouble and perplexity during the whole cour&s;e of his life and mini&s;try, I mean the libertines of Geneva. The&s;e were rather a cabal of rakes than a &s;ect of fanatics. For they made no pretences to any religious &s;y&s;tem, but pleaded only for the liberty of leading voluptu|ous and immoral lives.</P>
<P>The oppo&s;ition that was made to Calvin did not end here. He had conte&s;ts of another kind to &s;u&s;tain again&s;t tho&s;e who could not reli&s;h his theological &s;y&s;tem, and, more e&s;pecially, his doctrine in relation to <HI>eternal</HI> and <HI>ab&s;olute De|crees.</HI> He however executed his plan of di&s;ci|pline with the utmo&s;t rigour. He excluded ob&s;tinate offenders from the communion of the church, and even procured their bani&s;hment from the city.</P>
<P>The year 1545 was rendered infamous by that cruel and abominable edict which the par|liment of Aquitain i&s;&s;ued again&s;t the poor Wal|den&s;es, whereby the mo&s;t unparalleled barbarities were exerci&s;ed upon tho&s;e unhappy people, without any di&s;tinction of age or &s;ex, even to the very burning of their towns. The Wal|den&s;es, or Vaudois, were a &s;ect e&s;tabli&s;hed by Peter Vaud, or Valdo, a rich merchant of Lyons in France, in 1160, who found out &s;everal errors in the church of Rome, and be|gan a reformation.

<P>Calvin was greatly afflicted for the &s;ufferings of the Walden&s;es, to whom he had wrote con|&s;olatory letters a &s;hort time before, and &s;ent them faithful pa&s;tors for in&s;tructing them in the go&s;pel precepts. He wrote to the reformed in France, to convince them they acted in a per|nicious manner, who pretended it was no &s;in to be pre&s;ent at the popi&s;h &s;ervices, if they kept the true religion in their hearts. He told them, it was an error condemned by the ancient fa|thers: And, becau&s;e &s;ome of them might think him too rigid, he adjoined to his own the opinions of Melancthon, Bucer, and Martyr: whereby the name of the&s;e Nicodemites became obnoxious; for &s;o they were called, who cloaked their errors with his example.</P>
<P>When the emperor hold the diet at Rati&s;bon, in 1541, the nece&s;&s;ity of his affairs compelled him to grant the prote&s;tants the INTERIM; that is, a &s;et form of faith, which might be agreeable to both parties, till a general council &s;hould regulate the points wherein the prote&s;t|ants had abandoned the &s;entiments of the Ro|man church. The emperor wanted to invade the Turki&s;h dominions in Africa: But he lo&s;t half of his army in that fatal expedition, and
<PB N="82" REF="035737_0081_10064F0895C9BE58">returned to Germany, where he renewed his &s;everities again&s;t the prote&s;tants. Calvin a&s;&s;i&s;t|ed Melancthon in writing again&s;t the Interim; while the emperor and the king of England were engaged in a war again&s;t France, which ended in 1546, and was &s;oon followed by the deaths of Henry VIII. and Francis I.</P>
<P>The city of Geneva had been infe&s;ted with the plague, and very unhappy divi&s;ions began there in 1546. Calvin, from the pulpit, ex|claimed again&s;t the wickedne&s;s of the people, who revived the controver&s;y about their privi|leges, and would not &s;uffer their pa&s;tors to di&s;po&s;e of the eccle&s;ia&s;tical goods taken from the Pontificians, as they ought to be. The young people would not &s;uffer them&s;elves to be depri|ved of their &s;ports, taverns, and other places of debauchery. The mini&s;ters in&s;i&s;ted earne&s;tly upon it, both in the council and church, threat|ening the contumacious with excommunication. One of the council accu&s;ed Calvin, that he had taught fal&s;e doctrine for the &s;pace of &s;even years: But the council committed him to pri|&s;on, without the &s;olicitation of Calvin, and enjoined him to perform pennance by carrying a torch in his hand through the city.</P>
<P>Viret's &s;ervant received a letter from Calvin: But, in&s;tead of carrying it to his ma&s;ter, as he was directed, he delivered it to the Syndics, who broke it open, and were not a little di&s;|plea&s;ed at &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages in it, e&s;pecially where
<PB N="83" REF="035737_0082_10064F0A1E4373A8">he told Viret, <Q>that the people of Geneva would govern without GOD; and that he had to do with hypocrites.</Q> Calvin was &s;ent for to an&s;wer this before them; when he ju&s;tified his complaint by the in&s;tance of &s;everal debauched per&s;ons, who were &s;uffered to &s;coff at the word of GOD, and &s;coff at their in&s;truc|tions. He then left the city.</P>
<P><Q>Calvin, (&s;ays a late excellent writer) has been taxed with fiercene&s;s and bigotry: But his meekne&s;s and benevolence were as emi|nent, as the malice of his traducers is &s;hame|le&s;s. I &s;hall give one &s;ingle in&s;tance of his mode&s;ty and gentlene&s;s. While he was a very young man, di&s;putes run high between Luther and &s;ome other reformers, concerning the manner of Chri&s;t's pre&s;ence in the holy &s;acrament. Luther, who&s;e temper was na|turally warm and rough, heaped many hard names on the divines who differed from him on the article of con&s;ub&s;tantiation: and among the re&s;t, Calvin came in for his divi|dend of abu&s;e. Being informed of the har&s;h appellations he received, he meekly replied, in a letter to Bullinger;" 'Tis a frequent &s;aving with me, that, if Luther &s;hould even call me a devil, I hold him not|with&s;tanding in &s;uch veneration, that I &s;hall always own him to be an illu&s;trious &s;ervant of GOD; who, though he abounds in ex|traordinary virtues, is not without con&s;ider|able
<PB N="84" REF="035737_0083_10064F0BA81809C0">imperfections."&mdash;Turretin's opinion of him al&s;o de&s;erves attention. 'John Calvin, (&s;ays he) was a man, who&s;e memory will be ble&s;&s;eed in every &s;ucceeding age. He in|&s;tructed and enlightened, not only the church of Geneva, but al&s;o the whole re|formed world, by his immen&s;e labours. In|&s;omuch, that all the reformed churches are, in the gro&s;s, frequently called by his name.</Q> Thus wrote this candid Arminian, and there|fore an un&s;u&s;pected evidence of all undue par|tiality, &s;o late as the year 1734.</P>
<P>When Calvin returned to Geneva, the &s;e|nate publi&s;hed a decree, empowering the mini|&s;ters to require of every family an account of their faith: And they ordered, that no holy|day &s;hould be ob&s;erved but the &s;abbath.</P>
<P>Calvin, in his writings, every where de|clares, when he treats of the cau&s;e of &s;in, that the name of GOD ought not to be mentioned: Becau&s;e the nature of GOD is perfectly righte|ous and ju&s;t. <Q>How rank a calumny is it then, to charge a man who hath &s;o well de&s;er|ved of the church of GOD, with making GOD the author of &s;in: He teaches, on all occa&s;ions, that nothing can be without the will of GOD. He &s;ays, the wicked actions of men are &s;o ruled by the &s;ecret judgment of GOD, as that he is no ways acce&s;&s;ary to them. The &s;um of what he teaches is, that GOD, in a wonderful manner, and by ways un|known
<PB N="85" REF="035737_0084_10064F0D71856228">to us, directs all things to whatev e end he plea&s;ed. But why GOD wills wha &s;eems to us not &s;uitable to his nature, he acknowledges to be incomprehen&s;ible: And therefore denies that it &s;hould be over curi|ou&s;ly &s;earched into; becau&s;e the judgments of GOD are a va&s;t aby&s;s, and my&s;terious beyond our reach, which ought to be adored with awful reverence. But &s;till he keeps to this principle; that, though the rea&s;on of his council be unknown to us, the prai&s;e of righteou&s;ne&s;s is ever to be given to GOD; becau&s;e his will is the &s;upreme rule of equity.</Q> Let Calvin him&s;elf be heard again&s;t the abu&s;e, which men will attempt in defaming the great doctrine of predi&s;tination. <Q>In all our inqui|ries, (&s;ays he in his In&s;titute,) into predi&s;ti|natination, let us never fail to begin with effectual calling. Again; There are &s;ome who go on, &s;ecurely in &s;in, alledging, that if they are of the number of elect, their vices will not hinder them from going to heaven. Such abomoniable language as this is not the holy bleating of Chri&s;t's &s;heep, but, the im|pure grunting of &s;wine. For we learn from St. Paul, that we are elected to this very end, even to holine&s;s and blamele&s;&s;ne&s;s of life. Now, if &s;anctity of life is the very end, &s;cope, and drift of election it&s;elf; it will follow, that the doctrine of election &s;hould
<PB N="86" REF="035737_0085_10064F101C355428">awaken and &s;pur us on to &s;anctification, in|&s;tead of furni&s;hing us with a fal&s;e plea for idlene&s;s.</Q></P>
<P>Philibert Bertelier, regi&s;ter of the inferior court of ju&s;tice at Geneva, had been &s;u&s;pended from the &s;acrament by the pre&s;bytery, on ac|count of his vicious life: But he applied to the &s;enate to be ab&s;olved; and that body actually ab&s;olved him from the &s;entence. This was oppo&s;ed in the name of the pre&s;bytery, by Cal|vin, who &s;hewed, that the Chri&s;tian magi&s;trate ought to pre&s;erve, not to de&s;troy, the eccle&s;i|a&s;tical con&s;titution. The &s;acrament was to be admini&s;tered within two days. When Calvin came to hear what had pa&s;&s;ed, he &s;oon re&s;olved what to do, and preached again&s;t the contempt of the &s;acrament. He rai&s;ed his voice, lifted up his hands, and &s;aid that he would imitate St. Chry&s;o&s;tom: that he would not oppo&s;e force to force, but that he would rather &s;uffer him|&s;elf to be ma&s;&s;acred, than that his hands &s;hould pre&s;ent the holy my&s;teries to tho&s;e who had been judged unworthy of them. This was a thunderbolt, which confounded the faction of Bertelier; &s;o that it was not thought fit that he &s;hould pre&s;ent him&s;elf to the communion. The next day after the &s;acrament, Calvin, ac|companied by his con&s;i&s;tory, de&s;ired leave of the &s;enate, and of the council of two hundred, to &s;peak to the people about this matter, as it concerned the abrogation of a law made by the
<PB N="87" REF="035737_0086_10064F12C1C097D8">people. This made &s;o great an impre&s;&s;ion on their minds, that it was re&s;olved the Swi&s;s Can|tons &s;hould be con&s;ulted about it; and that the decree of the two hundred &s;hould be &s;u&s;pended; but that none &s;hould &s;ay the ancient regulati|ons had been infringed.</P>
<P>Calvin di&s;patched letters to &s;ome of the prin|cipal pa&s;tors in the Helvetic cities; craving earne&s;tly at their hands to re&s;pect this affair, as a thing whereon the whole &s;tate of religion and piety in that church &s;o much depended, that the cau&s;e of GOD, and all good men, were inevitably certain to be trampled under foot, unle&s;s tho&s;e cities, by their good means, might be brought to give &s;entence with the mini&s;ters of Geneva, when the cau&s;e &s;hould be brought before them. The Swi&s;s pa&s;tors an|&s;wered, that they had heard of tho&s;e con&s;i&s;to|rial laws, and acknowledged them to be godly ordinances, drawing towards the pre&s;cript of the word of God; for which cau&s;e, they did not think it good for the church of Geneva, by innovation, to change the &s;ame, but rather to keep them as they were.</P>
<P>The attempts of Michael Servede or Serve|tus, a Spani&s;h phy&s;ician, were much alarming to tho&s;e who had the cau&s;e of true religion at heart. This man, who has made &s;uch a noi&s;e in the world, was born at Villa Nueva, in the kingdom of Arragon, di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf by the &s;uperiority of his genius and had made a
<PB N="88" REF="035737_0087_10064F144F4C2340">con&s;iderable progre&s;s in various branches of &s;cience. In the years 1531 and 1532, he pub|li&s;hed, in Latin, his <HI>Seven books concerning the errors that are contained in the doctrine of the Trinity,</HI> and his two Dialogues on the &s;ame &s;ubject, in which he attacked, in the mo&s;t au|dacious manner, the &s;entiments adopted by far the greate&s;t part of the Chri&s;tian church, in re|lation to the <HI>Divine Nature,</HI> and a <HI>Trinity</HI> of per&s;ons in the <HI>Godhead.</HI> Some years after this he travelled into France, and, after a variety of adventures, &s;ettled at Vienne in Dauphine, where he applied him&s;elf, with &s;ucce&s;s, to the practice of phy&s;ic. It was here, that, letting loo&s;e the reins of his warm and irregular ima|gination, he invented that &s;trange &s;y&s;tem of theology, which was printed, in a clande&s;tine manner, in the year 1553, under the title of <HI>Chri&s;tianity re&s;tored.</HI> The man &s;eemed to be &s;eized with a pa&s;&s;ion for reforming (in his w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y), and many things concurred to favour his de|&s;igns, &s;uch as the &s;ire of his genius, the extent of his learning, the power of his eloquence, the &s;trength of his re&s;olution, the ob&s;tinacy of his temper, and an external appearance, at lea&s;t, of piety, that rendered all the re&s;t doubly en|gaging. Add to all this, the protection and friend&s;hip of many per&s;ons of weight, in France, Germany, and Italy, which Servetus had ob|tained by his talents and abilities both natural and acquired; and it will appear that &s;ew in|novators
<PB N="89" REF="035737_0088_10064F1625731CC8">have &s;et out with a better pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s. But, notwith&s;tanding the&s;e &s;ignal ad|vantages, all his views were totally di&s;appoint|ed by the vigilance and &s;everity of Calvin, who, when Servetus had e&s;caped from his pri|&s;on at Vienne, and was pa&s;&s;ing through Switz|erland, in order to &s;eek refuge in It<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ly, cau&s;ed him to be apprehended at Geneva, in the year 1553, and had an accu&s;ation of bla&s;phemy brought again&s;t him before the council. The i&s;&s;ue of this accu&s;ation was fatal to Servetus, who, adhering re&s;olutely to the opinions he had embraced, was, by a public &s;entence of the court, declared an ob&s;tinate heretic, and, in con&s;equence thereof, condemned to the flames. For it is ob&s;ervable, that, at this time, the an|cient laws that had been enacted again&s;t here|tics by the emperor Frederic II. and had been &s;o frequently renewed after his reign, were &s;till in vigour at Geneva. It mu&s;t, however, be acknowledged, that this learned and ingeni|ous &s;ufferer was worthy of a better fate; though it is certain, on the other hand, that his f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ults were neither few nor trivial; &s;ince it is well known, that his exce&s;&s;ive arrogance was ac|companied with a malignant and contentious &s;pirit, an invincible ob&s;tinacy of temper, and a con&s;iderable portion of fanatici&s;m.</P>
<P>The author of the memoirs of literature &s;ays, <Q>If the religion of prote&s;tants depended on the doctrine and conduct of the reformers, he
<PB N="90" REF="035737_0089_10064F1B4D5EFD28">&s;hould take care how he publi&s;hed his account of Servetus: But as the prote&s;tant religion is entirely <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">f unded on holy &s;cripture; &s;o the defaults of the reformers ought not to have any ill influence on the reformation. The doctrine of nontoleration, which obtained in the &s;ixteenth century, among &s;ome prote&s;t|ants, was that pernicious error which they had imbibed in the church of Rome: And, I believe, I can &s;ay, without doing any inju|ry to that church, that &s;he is, in a great mea&s;ure, an&s;werable for the execution of Servetus. If the Roman catholics had never put any per&s;on to death for the &s;ake of religi|on; I care &s;ay, that Servetus had never been condemned to die in any prote&s;tant <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i|ty. Let us remember, that Calvin, and all the magi&s;trates of Geneva, in the year 1553, were born and bred up in the church of Rome: This is the be&s;t apology that can be made for them.</Q></P>
<P>The number of &s;trangers vi&s;ibly increa&s;ed in Geneva; and the Engli&s;h were all<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">wed to found a church of their own nation in the city, as the Italians had done before them in 1551, and the Spaniards &s;ome time afterwards: But when Q. Elizabeth came to the throne, and re|vived the prote&s;tant religion, the Engli&s;h thanked the magi&s;trates for their protection, and returned to their own country.</P>
<P>In 1555, a con&s;piracy was form<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d again&s;t the
<PB N="91" REF="035737_0090_10064F1CD7132290">mini&s;ters of Geneva: But it was &s;ea&s;onably di&s;|covered, and the con&s;pirators puni&s;hed; &s;ome being beheaded, and others bani&s;hed. Calvin went to Bern, and defended him&s;elf again&s;t Bol&s;ec, who was bani&s;hed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">r accu&s;ing him of fal&s;e doctrine. Calvin regulated the church of Poland; he comforted the per&s;ecuted in En|gland, and encouraged the affl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ected in France. But, in 1556, a tertian ague &s;eized upon him as he was preaching, which obliged him to quit the pulpit, and it was rumoured abroad that he was dead. He recovered, and went to Franckfort to pacify &s;ome controver&s;ies which had lately &s;prung up in the French church.</P>
<P>The number of youth, who came from all parts to &s;tudy at Geneva, increa&s;ed &s;o much, that the old &s;chool was not large enough to con|tain them. The council therefore re&s;olved to erect a new college for &s;even cla&s;&s;es, and three profe&s;&s;ors of Hebrew, Greek, and philo&s;ophy; be&s;ides divinity lectures, which Calvin read him&s;elf, to whom was joined Theodore Beza, who preached the following week after Calvin. The &s;tatutes of this college were fir&s;t publi&s;hed in St. Peter's church, before the magi&s;trates, mini&s;ters, and &s;cholars, by Calvin, who &s;eemed to con&s;ecrate &s;o body and profitable a founda|tion.</P>
<P>On the &s;ixth of February, 1564, Calvin preached his la&s;t &s;ermon. He was faint, thin, and con&s;umptive. He had for ten years toge|ther
<PB N="92" REF="035737_0091_10064F1E5FFB4180">ab&s;tained from dinners, for he was fre|quently troubled with the head-ach, which his ab&s;tinence only could cure. By &s;training his voice, and u&s;ing of aloes, he brought on the hemorhoids, which at la&s;t proved ulcerous; and he had al&s;o a &s;pitting of blood. When his ague left him, the gout took him in his right leg; then the cholic, and la&s;tly the &s;tone, which he never perceived till a few months be|fore his death.</P>
<P>Though he was tormented with &s;o many violent di&s;ea&s;es, he never uttered a word un|becoming a Chri&s;tian, and &s;o great a divine; only lifting up his eyes to heaven, he u&s;ed to &s;ay, "How long, Lord!" which was an ex|pre&s;&s;ion he con&s;tantly u&s;ed, when he heard of the calamities which afflicted his prote&s;tant brethren, for which he felt more than for any thing that could befal him&s;elf. On the twenty-&s;eventh of March he was carried in his chair to the &s;enate, when he pre&s;ented to them a new rector for the &s;chool; then uncovered his head, and thanked them for all their favours, and particularly for their great care of him in his &s;ickne&s;s: <Q>For I perceive, (&s;aid he), this is the la&s;t time I &s;hall come into this place.</Q> His voice failed him as he &s;poke, and the a&s;&s;em|bly took leave of him in tears.</P>
<P>On the &s;econd of April, which was Ea&s;ter|day, he was carried to the church, where Beza edmini&s;tered to him the &s;acrament. He made
<PB N="93" REF="035737_0092_10064F2034BA2370">his will on the 25th and on the 27th died, <Q>having, by over-much &s;tudy, brought upon him &s;everal di&s;tempers.</Q> He died in the fif|ty fourth year of his age, and was buried the next morning, in the common church-yard of the large palace, according as he had de&s;ired in his will, without any pomp or epitaph.</P>
<P>Burnham, in his Prous Memorials, tran&s;|lates from Melch. Adam, the following ac|count of his la&s;t will and death; he dictated his will to the public notary of Geneva in the&s;e words. <Q>I. John Calvin, mini&s;ter of the word of GOD in the church of Geneva, be|ing &s;o oppre&s;&s;ed and afflicted with divers di&s;ea&s;es, that I conclude the Lord GOD hath appointed &s;hortly to take me out of this world; therefore have determined to make my la&s;t will and te&s;tament in this form fol|lowing:</Q></P>
<Q><P>Fir&s;t, I give thanks to GOD, that, tak|ing pity on me, whom he created and placed in this world, he hath delivered me out of the deep darkne&s;s of idolatry, into which I was plunged; and hath brought me into the light of his go&s;pel, and made me a partaker of the doctrine of &s;alvation, whereof I was mo&s;t unworthy. And he hath not only gently and graciou&s;ly borne with my faults and &s;ins, for which I de&s;erved to be rejected of him and ca&s;t out, but hath treated me with &s;uch meekne&s;s and mildne&s;s, that he
<PB N="94" REF="035737_0093_10064F22DC53A5E0">hath vouch&s;afed to u&s;e my labours in preach|ing and publi&s;hing the truth of his go&s;pel. And I witne&s;s and declare, that I intend to pa&s;s the remainder of my life in the &s;ame faith and religion which he hath delivered to me by his go&s;pel; and not to &s;eek any other aid, or refuge for &s;alvation, than his free adoption; in which alone &s;alvation re&s;teth. And, with my whole heart, I em|brace the mercy which he hath u&s;ed towards me for Je&s;us Chri&s;t's &s;ake; recompen&s;ing my faults with the merit of his death and pa&s;&s;ion, that &s;atisfaction might be made, by his death for all my &s;ins and crimes, and the remembrance of them be blotted out. I witne&s;s al&s;o and declare, that I humbly beg of him, that being wa&s;hed and clean&s;ed in the bl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">od of that highe&s;t Redeemer, &s;hed for the &s;ins of mankind, I mu&s;t &s;tand at his judgment-&s;eat, under the image of my Re|deemer.</P>
<P>Al&s;o I declare, that I have diligently en|deavoured, acc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rding to the mea&s;ure of grace received and the bounty which GOD hath u&s;ed toward<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> me, that I might preach his word hol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ly and purely, as well in &s;er|mons, as in commentaries, and other writ|ings; and interpret his holy &s;criptures faith|fully.</P>
<P>But, alas! that &s;tudy and zeal of mine (if worthy &s;o to be called) have been &s;o remi&s;s

And, unle&s;s the unmea&s;urable bounty of GOD had been pre&s;ent, my &s;tudies had been vain and va|ni&s;hing. For which cau&s;es, I witne&s;s and declare, that I hope for no other help for &s;alvation than this only; that &s;eeing GOD is the father of mercy. I tru&s;t he hath &s;hew|ed him&s;elf a father to me, who acknowledge my&s;elf a mi&s;erable &s;inner.</P>
<P>As for other things, after my departure out of this life. I would have my body com|mitted to the earth, in that order and man|ner which is u&s;ual in this church and city, till the ble&s;&s;ed day of re&s;urrection cometh &amp;c.</P></Q>
<P>To the four &s;yndics, and all the magi&s;trates, who in a body honoured him with a vi&s;it be|fore his death, he &s;poke to the following effect:</P>
<Q><P>Honoured &s;irs, I give you great thanks that you have done me this honour, having not de&s;erved it from you, and that you have &s;o often borne with my infirmities: Which, to me, hath always been an argu|ment of your &s;ingular goodne&s;s for me.</P>
<P>Touching the doctrine you have heard from me, I take GOD to witne&s;s, that I have not ra&s;hly and ungroundedly, but carefully and purely taught the word of GOD intru&s;ted to me: who&s;e wrath I &s;hould

<P>And I te&s;tify this the more willingly, both before God and your&s;elves; becau&s;e, I doubt not but the devil, according to his cu&s;tom will rai&s;e up wicked, light, and gid|dy headed people, to corrupt the &s;incere doc|trine which you have heard from me.</P></Q>

<P>And, continuing his di&s;cour&s;e, he &s;hewed them at large, the danger of pride and &s;ecurity; the great dangers they were al&s;o in from errors in judgment, and corruptions in practice.</P>
<P>Then he prayed to GOD for the increa&s;e of his gifts and ble&s;&s;ings upon them, and for the &s;afety and welfare of the commonwealth. After which, giving his hand to each of them, they took their leave; departing full of &s;orrow, and with many tears, as from their common father.</P>

April 28. The mini&s;ters of Geneva being with him, he &s;pake thus to them&mdash; <Q>Brethren, after my decea&s;e &s;tand fa&s;t in this work of the Lord, and be not di&s;couraged; for the Lord will pre&s;erve this church and commonwealth again&s;t the threatnings of the enemies. When I came fir&s;t to this city, the go&s;pel indeed was preached, but the management of things, with re&s;pect to it, was very trou|ble&s;ome: Many conceiving, that Chri&s;tiani|ty was nothing more than the demoli&s;hing of images. And there were not a few wick|ed per&s;ons, from whom I &s;uffered many things. But the Lord our God &s;o &s;trength|ened and confirmed me, who am not natu|rally bold, that I gave not place to any of their attempts. I profe&s;s, brethren, that I have lived with you in true love and &s;incere charity; and thus I now depart from you. If you have found me any way petti&s;h under my di&s;ea&s;e, I crave your pardon; and give you very great thanks, that you have &s;o borne, on your part, the burden impo&s;ed on me, in the times of my &s;ickne&s;s.</Q></P>
<P>Having thus &s;poken, he gave his hand to each of them, who then took their leave, &s;or|rowing and weeping.</P>
<P>A while after, Calvin hearing that Viret, who was eighty years of age, and &s;ickly, was on his journey to vi&s;it him, wrote thus to &s;tay him.</P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="035737_0097_10064F2E67308C08">
<Q>Farewell, my be&s;t and &s;incere&s;t brother: GOD will have you to out-live me in this world, live mindful of our friend&s;hip; for it has been profitable to the church of GOD here, &s;o the fruit of it tarrieth for us in hea|ven. I would not have you weary your&s;elf for my &s;ake. I hardly draw my breath: And I expect daily when it will wholly fail me. It is enough that I live and die to Chri&s;t, who is gain to his both in life and death. Again farewell." May 11, 1564,</Q></P>
<P>Yet notwith&s;tanding this letter, the good old man came to Geneva; and having folly confered with Calvin, he returned to New|come. After which, Calvin pa&s;&s;ed his re|maining time almo&s;t wholly in prayer, with his eyes towards heaven; while his voice of|ten failed him, by rea&s;on of the &s;hortne&s;s of his breath.</P>
<P>He died as we ob&s;erved before, May the 27th, A. D. 1564, aged fifty-four years, ten mouths, and &s;eventeen days. Beza had but ju&s;t left him when Calvin &s;uddenly altered for death. On which a me&s;&s;enger was di&s;patched after Beza to bring him back; but though Be|za returned pre&s;ently, Calvin, without a &s;igh or groan was fallen a&s;leep in Je&s;us before Beza could reach him.</P>

When he took leave of the peo|ple at Stra&s;burg (as we have mentioned above) to return to Geneva, they would have conti|nued his freedom of the city, and the revenues of a prebend; which had been a&s;&s;igned him; The former he accepted but ab&s;olutely refu|&s;ed the latter.</P>
<P>When his friends would have di&s;&s;uaded him in his &s;ickne&s;s, from dictating, and e&s;pecially from writing, he an&s;wered; <Q>What; would you have me idle when my Lord comes?</Q></P>
<P><Q>It is a &s;trong proof of his not having &s;tu|died to heap up riches, that all his effects, notwith&s;tanding his library were &s;old very dear, as &s;carce amounted to three hundred crowns; &s;o that he might very ju&s;tly, as well as elegant|ly, in order to wipe off this mon&s;trous calum|ny, u&s;e the&s;e words, in the preface to his Commentary on the P&s;alms; <HI>If I cannot in my life time per&s;uade &s;ome people that I am no hoarder of money, I &s;hall convince them at my death.</HI> The &s;enate certainly can witne&s;s for him, that, though his &s;tipend was very &s;mall, he was &s;o far from being un&s;atisfyed with it, that he po&s;itively refu&s;ed the offer of increa|&s;ing it.</Q> This is one of the m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;t extraordinary victories, the magnaminity of grace obtains o|ver nature, even in tho&s;e who are mini&s;tere of he go&s;pel.

<P>The works of Calvin, publi&s;hed at Geneva, comprehended twelve volumes in folio; which the edition of Am&s;terdam, 1667, has reduced to nine. His commentaries upon the Bible are the mo&s;t con&s;iderable part of his works: But he guined mo&s;t honour by his "Chri&s;tian In&s;ti|tution," which was wrote in defence of the prote&s;tant religion, and has been always e&s;teem|ed an incomparable work. This "in&s;titution" has not only appeared in French, but al&s;o in High Dutch, Low Dutch, Italian, Spani&s;h, and Engli&s;h.

<HEAD>CONCLUSION.</HEAD>
<P>AS the hi&s;tory of particular per&s;ons al|ways throws light upon the age in which they lived; it is pre&s;umed, that the preceding Memoirs al&s;o, which relate to emi|nent men in the church of Chri&s;t, from the aera of the reformation (and a great number more might have been produced, if our limits had allowed) not only di&s;cover their own cha|racter, but the characters of the &s;everal times in which they appeared. Pe&s;&s;ibly, therefore, the&s;e accounts, will be not only edifying to the faith, but in&s;tructive to the mind, of our &s;eri|ous readers, and of tho&s;e younger per&s;ons e&s;pe|cially, who wi&s;h to be acquainted with our eccle&s;ia&s;tical hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>The intelligent Chri&s;tian may perceive, that we have &s;tudiou&s;ly avoided any undue predilec|tions to any particular party or profe&s;&s;ion; knowing that the grace of God is confined to no party, and entailed upon no one profe&s;&s;ion of Chri&s;tianity in the world. The&s;e Memoirs, if they prove any thing, abundantly prove this truth. And though the compiler mu&s;t natural|ly have his predilections and pa&s;&s;ions, or he
<PB N="102" REF="035737_0101_10064F3773386D40">would not be a fallen &s;on of fallen Adam; yet he can truly &s;ay, that he has watched over the&s;e infirmities of human nature, and has been above all things de&s;irous, that the glory of God may be &s;een to triumph over the nar|rowne&s;s of men, and that the grace of God in his mo&s;t excellent &s;ervants, may al&s;o appear to be one and the &s;ame ble&s;&s;ing; notwith&s;tanding the prejudices of birth and education; which do indeed &s;trike the mind with much &s;tronger impre&s;&s;ions, than perhaps any of us are readily apt to imagine.</P>
<P>In reviewing the work, our readers may probable perceive, that &s;ome of the following con&s;iderations pre&s;ent them&s;elves to the mind, and that they are ju&s;tified by many particular circum&s;tances in the&s;e Lives.</P>
<P>The reformation of the Prote&s;tant church from popery proceeded chiefly upon, what are ju&s;tly enough called, <HI>The Doctrines of Grace,</HI> in oppo&s;ition to a variety of corrupt opinions, and to a greater variety of anti&s;criptural &s;uper|&s;titions which had been grounded upon them. Tho&s;e doctrines were not <HI>novelties</HI> (as &s;ome of the Papi&s;ts affected to treat them) becau&s;e they were not only as ancient as divine revelation it&s;elf, but were al&s;o maintained more or le&s;s in all ages of the chri&s;tian church; though, for &s;ome centuries before the reformation, but by comparatively a few &s;cattered per&s;ons, who
<PB N="103" REF="035737_0102_10064F38FB367E38">&s;hone as &s;tars amid&s;t the gloom of darkne&s;s which generally pervaded Europe.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t con&s;iderable <HI>body</HI> of people profe&s;|&s;ing &s;criptural and un&s;ophi&s;ticated divinity, were the Albigen&s;es in the &s;outh of France, and the Walden&s;es in Piedmont. The latter name, however, became the general one, up|on the great &s;pread of their doctrine, which was one and the &s;ame, after the junction of the pious Peter Waldo or Valdo, about the year 1170, from whom this appellation was taken. From the&s;e real chri&s;tians, living for the mo&s;t part in mountainous and almo&s;t inacce&s;&s;ible places becau&s;e of their enemies, was derived the primary root of all the &s;ub&s;equent refor|mations. Their origin is carried up very high into the pure&s;t ages of the church. It is cer|tain that a Romi&s;h council at Tours in 1163 condemned them as maintainers of an here&s;y, LONG SINCE &s;prung up in the territory of Thoulou&s;e, i. e. among tho&s;e called Albigen|&s;es. "This &s;ect," &s;ays Cave, from Reineri|us, (a monki&s;h adver&s;ary, who wrote again&s;t them about the year 1254) <Q>&s;oon increa&s;ed to an immen&s;e number of followers, and pre|vailed every where; and &s;ome have affirmed, that it exi&s;ted in the days of Pope Sylve&s;ter, (i. e. in the year 314) or rather from the Apo&s;tolic age it&s;elf, and that there is no country in Europe into which it hath not extended it&s;elf.</Q> It is not improbable, that
<PB N="104" REF="035737_0103_10064F3A8BB4B828">they were de&s;cendents of tho&s;e excellent chri|&s;tians, who wrote from Lyons in France the very remarkable Epi&s;tle to the A&s;ian churches, in the &s;econd century after Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>They continued likewi&s;e, as well as &s;pread; for when Luther and the other reformers ap|peared in the &s;ixteenth century, the de&s;cen|dants of the&s;e per&s;ecuted people (who were called by abundance of nick-names) held a cor|dial corre&s;pondence with them, a&s;toni&s;hed on both &s;ides to find the clo&s;ene&s;s of their &s;imilari|ty. Hence Gretzer the Je&s;uit called them, 'the great ance&s;tors of the Calvini&s;ts.' Of the mo&s;t remarkable <HI>individuals,</HI> who &s;upported the great truths of the go&s;pel, with more or le&s;s clearne&s;s, from the days of the fathers, &s;everal re&s;pectable names may be adduced in &s;ucce&s;&s;ive ages; but in this place we cannot give even their names, though their hi&s;tory de&s;erves the ample&s;t con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>Ble&s;&s;ed be God! his truth &s;hall &s;tand to the end of the world, and his go&s;pel till the la&s;t of the redeemed is ready for glory. There is a SPIRITUAL CHURCH, con&s;i&s;ting of Chri&s;t's faithful people, and of them only, gathered, perhaps, out of all denominations; and this church, founded on the everla&s;ting Rock, is impregnable to every a&s;&s;ault of its enemies. No weapon, formed again&s;t it, can pro&s;per. This con&s;ideration &s;hould afford every true believer great con&s;olation, under all dark appearances
<PB N="105" REF="035737_0104_100646D7552D95C8">either in vi&s;ible churches or in the world. 'Tis God's cau&s;e, and not man's: the arm, there|fore, which &s;upports it, is omnipotent and di|vine. <HI>The</HI> LORD <HI>of</HI> HOSTS <HI>is with us</HI> (may this <HI>church of the fir&s;t-born</HI> triumph;) <HI>the God of Jacob is our refuge!</HI></P>
<P>And may God, who&s;e goodne&s;s extends from age to age, and who&s;e favour is the life of &s;ouls, ble&s;s and unite this HOLY CHURCH at all times in &s;pirit and in truth, that it may be e&s;tabli&s;hed and pro&s;per upon earth, and that many of all nations may flow unto it. May di&s;cord and every work of the fle&s;h be far removed from among brethren, and may they love, and &s;tu|dy to love more and more, all of all denomina|tions, who love our lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t in &s;in|cerity. May the &s;alvation of the redeemed &s;pread farther and wider by all manner of holy means; till the kingdoms of the world become the kingdoms of the Lord, and of his Chri&s;t, and till every tongue &s;hall confe&s;s with joy, THE LORD GOD OMNIPOTENT REIGNETH!
