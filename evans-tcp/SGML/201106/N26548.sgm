<HEAD>THE SHEPHERD OF SALISBURY PLAIN</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">PART I.</HEAD>
<P>MR. JOHNSON, a very worthy charitable gentle|man, was travelling &s;ome time ago acro&s;s one of tho&s;e va&s;t plains which are well known in Wilt&s;hire. It was a fine &s;ummer's evening, and he rode &s;lowly that he might have lei&s;ure to admire God in the works of his creation; for this gentleman was of opinion, that a walk or a ride was as proper a time as any to think a|bout good things, for which rea&s;on, on &s;uch occa&s;ions, he &s;eldom thought &s;o much about his money, or his trade, or public news, as at other times, that he might with more ea&s;e and &s;atisfaction enjoy the pious thoughts which the vi&s;ible works of the great Maker of heaven and earth are intended to rai&s;e in the mind.</P>
<P>His attention was all of a &s;udden called off by the barking of a &s;hepherd's dog, and looking up he &s;pied one of tho&s;e little huts, which are here and there to be &s;een on the&s;e great Downs; and near it was the &s;hepherd him&s;elf bu&s;ily employed with his dog in collecting toge|ther his va&s;t flock of &s;heep. As he drew nearer he per|ceived him to be a clean, well looking, poor man, near fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ty years of age. His coat, though at fir&s;t it had pro|bably been of one dark colour, had been in along cour&s;e of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;o often patched with different &s;orts of clo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h,
<PB N="4" REF="035296_0003_1001BF872A9C5EF8">that it was now become hard to &s;ay which had been the orginal colour. But this, while it gave a plain proof of the &s;hepherd's poverty, equally proved the exceeding neatne&s;s, indu&s;try and good management of his wife.&mdash; His &s;tockings no le&s;s proved her good hou&s;e wifery, for they were entirely covered with darns of different co|loured wor&s;ted, but had not a hole in them; and his &s;hirt, though nearly as coar&s;e as the &s;ails of a &s;hip, was as white as the drifted &s;now, and nearly mended where time had either made a rent, or worn it thin. This is a rule of judging, by which one &s;hall &s;eldom be deceived. If I meet with a laborer hedging, ditching, or mend|ing the highways with his &s;tockings and &s;hirt tight and whole, however mean and bad his other garments are, I have &s;eldom failed, on vi&s;iting his cottage, to find that al&s;o clean and well ordered, and his wife notable, and worthy of encouragement. Whereas a poor woman, who will be lying a-bed, or go&s;&s;ipping with her neigh|bors, when &s;he ought to be fitting out her hu&s;band in a cleanly manner, will &s;eldom be found to be very good in other re&s;pects.</P>
<P>This was not the ca&s;e with our &s;hepherd; and Mr. John&s;on was not more &s;truck with the decency of his mean and frugal dre&s;s, than with his open hone&s;t counte|nance, which bore &s;trong marks of health, cheerfulne&s;s, and &s;pirit.</P>
<P>Mr. John&s;on, who was on a journey, and &s;omewhat fearful from the appearance of the &s;ky, that rain was at no great di&s;tance, acco&s;ted the &s;hepherd with a&s;king what &s;ort of weather he thought it would be on the morrow.&mdash;"It will be &s;uch weather as plea&s;es me," an|&s;wered the &s;hepherd. Though the an&s;wer was delivered in the milde&s;t and civile&s;t tone that could be imagined, the gentleman thought the words them&s;elves rather rude and &s;urly, and a&s;ked him how that could be, "Becau&s;e," replied the &s;hepherd "it will be &s;uch weather as &s;hall plea&s;e God, and whatever plea&s;es hun always plea&s;es <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ic."</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="035296_0004_1001BF8E4FD9FBC0">
Mr. John&s;on, who delighted in good men and good things, was very well &s;atisfied with his reply: for he ju&s;tly thought, that though an hypocrite may ea&s;ily con|trive to appear better than he really is to a &s;tranger; and that no one &s;hould be too &s;oon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">alted, merely for hav|ing a few good words in his mouth; yet as he knew that "out of the abundance of the heart the mouth &s;peaketh," he always accu&s;tomed him&s;elf to judge fa|vorably of tho&s;e who had a &s;erious deportment and &s;o|lid manner of &s;peaking. "It looks as if it proceeded from a good habit," &s;aid he, "and though I may now and then be deceived by it, yet it has not often happened to me to be &s;o. Whereas, if a man acco&s;ts me with an idle, di&s;&s;olute, vurgar, indecent, or profane expre&s;&s;ion, I have never been deceived in him, but have generally, on enquiry, found his character to be as bad as his language gave me room to expect."</P>
<P>He entered into conver&s;ation with the &s;hepherd in the following manner. Yours is a trouble&s;ome life, hon|e&s;t friend, &s;aid he. To be &s;ure, &s;ir, replied the &s;hepherd, it is not a very lazy life; but it is not near &s;o toil&s;ome as that which my GREAT MASTER led for my &s;ake, and he had every &s;tate and condition of life at his c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ce, and cho&s;e a hard one, while I only &s;ubmit to the lot that is appointed me. You are expo&s;ed to great cold and near, &s;aid the gentleman; true, &s;ir, &s;aid the &s;hepherd; but then I am not expo&s;ed to great temptations; and &s;o throwing one thing again&s;t another, God is plea&s;ed to contrive to make things more equal than we poor, ignorant, &s;hort-&s;ighted creatures are apt to think. David was happier when he kept his father's &s;heep on &s;uch a plain as this, and &s;inging &s;ome of his own p&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ms, perhaps, than <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">r he was when he became king of I&s;rac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and Judah.

<P>You think then, &s;aid the gentleman, that a laborious life is a happy one. I do, &s;ir, and more &s;o e&s;pecially, as it expo&s;es a man to fewer &s;ins. If King Saul had con|tinued a poor laborious man to the end of his days, he might have lived happy and hone&s;t, and died a natural death in his bed at la&s;t, which you know, &s;ir, was more than he did. But I &s;peak with reverence, for it was di|vine Providence over-rul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> all that, you know, &s;ir, and I do not pre&s;ume to make compari&s;ons. Be&s;ides, &s;ir, my employment has been particularly honored&mdash;Mo&s;es was a &s;hepherd in the plains of Midian. It was to "&s;hep|herds keeping then flocks by night," that the angels appeared in Bethlehem, to tell the be&s;t news, the glad|de&s;t tidings, that ever were revealed to poor &s;inful men: often, and often has the thought warmed my poor heart in the colde&s;t night, and filled me with more joy and thankfulne&s;s than the be&s;t &s;upper could have done.</P>
<P>Here the &s;hepherd &s;topped, for he began to feel that he had made too free, and had talked too long. But Mr. John&s;on was &s;o well plea&s;ed with what he &s;aid, and with the cheerful contented manner in which he &s;aid it, that he de&s;ired him to go on freely, for that it was a plea&s;ure to him to meet with a plain man, who, without any kind of learning but what he had got from the Bible, was able to talk &s;o well on a &s;ubject in which all men, high and low, rich and poor, are equally concerned.</P>
<P>Indeed I am afraid I make too bold, &s;ir, for it better becomes me to li&s;ten to &s;uch a gentleman as you &s;eem to be, than to talk in my poor way; but as I was &s;ay|ing, &s;ir, I wonder all working men do not derive as great joy and delight as I do from thinking how God has honored po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ty!&mdash;Oh! &s;ir, what great, or rich, or mighty men have had &s;uch honor put on them, or their condition, as &s;hepherds, tent-makers, fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">herm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n, and car|penters have had!</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="035296_0006_1001BF98E2731F50">
My hone&s;t friend, &s;aid the gentleman, I perceive you are well acquainted with &s;cripture. Yes, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">r, pretty w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ll, ble&s;&s;ed be God! through his mercy I learnt to read when I was a little boy; though reading was not &s;o com|mon when I was a child, as, I am tol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, thro' the good|ne&s;s of Providence, and the genero&s;ity of the rich, it is likely to become now-a-days. I believe there is no day for the la&s;t thirty years, that I have not peeped at my Bible. If we can't find time to read a chapter, I defy any man to &s;ay he can't find time to read a ver&s;e; and a &s;ingle text, &s;ir, well followed and put in practice every day, would make no bad figure at the year's end; three hundred and &s;ixty-five texts, without the lo&s;s of a mo|ment's time, would make a pretty &s;tock, a little golden trea&s;ury, as one may &s;ay, from new-year's day to new-year's day; and if children were brought up to it, they would look for their text as naturally as they do for their breakfa&s;t. No laboring man, it is true, has &s;o much lei&s;ure as a &s;hepherd, for while the flock is feed|ing, I am obliged to be &s;till, and at &s;uch times I can now and then tap a &s;hoe for my children or my&s;elf, which is a great &s;aving to us, and while I am doing that I repeat a bit of a chapter, which makes the time pa&s;s plea&s;antly in this wild &s;olitary place. I can &s;ay the be&s;t part of the Bible by heart, I believe I &s;hould not &s;ay the be&s;t part, for every part is good, but I mean the grea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;t part.&mdash;I have led but a lonely life, and have often had but lit|tle to eat, but my Bible has been meat, drink, and com|pany to me, as I may &s;ay, and when want and trouble had come upon me, I don't know what I &s;hould have done indeed, &s;ir, if I had not had the promi&s;es of this book for my &s;tay and &s;upport.</P>
<P>You have had great difficulties then? &s;aid Mr. John|&s;on. Why, as to that, &s;ir, not more than neighbors fare, I have but little cau&s;e to complain, and much to be thankful, but I have had &s;ome little &s;truggles, as I will leave you to judge.&mdash;I have a wife and eight children,
<PB N="8" REF="035296_0007_1001BF9C833B4D10">whom I bred up in that little cottage which you &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e un|der the hill about hal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> mile off. What, that with the &s;moke coming out of the chimney, &s;aid the gentleman. O no, &s;ir, replied the &s;hepherd &s;miling, we have &s;eldom &s;moke in the evening, for we have little to cook, and firing is very dear in the&s;e parts. It is that cottage which you &s;ee on the left hand of the church, near that little tuft of hawthorns. What, that hovel with only one room above and one below, with &s;carcely any chimney, how is it po&s;&s;ible you can live there with &s;uch a fami|ly! O! it is very po&s;&s;ible and very certain too, cried the &s;hepherd. How many better men have been wor&s;e lodged! how many good chri&s;tians have peri&s;hed in pri&s;ons and dungeons, in compari&s;on of which my cot|tage is a pal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ce. The hou&s;e is very well, &s;ir, and if the rain did not &s;ometimes beat down upon us through the thatch when we are a-bed, I &s;hould not de&s;ire a better; for I have health, peace, and liberty, and no man maketh me afraid.</P>
<P>W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ll, I will certainly call on you before it be long; but how can you contrive to lodge &s;o many children?&mdash;We do the be&s;t we can, &s;ir. My poor wife is a very &s;ickly woman, or we &s;hould always have done tolerably well. There are no gentry in the pari&s;h, &s;o that &s;he has not met with any great a&s;&s;i&s;tance in her &s;ickne&s;s. The good curate of the pari&s;h, who lives in that pretty par|&s;onage in the valley, is very willing, but not very able to a&s;&s;i&s;t us on the&s;e trying occa&s;ions, for he has little e|nough for him&s;elf and a large family into the bargain. Yet he does what he can, and more than many richer men do, and more than he can well afford. Be&s;ides that, hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> prayers and good advice we are always &s;ure of, and we are truly thankful for that, for a man mu&s;t give, you know, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ir, according to what he hath, and not according to w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">at he hath not.</P>
<P>Are you in any di&s;tre&s;s at pre&s;ent? &s;aid Mr. John|&s;on. No, &s;ir, thank God, replied the &s;hephered. I g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t my

Only! &s;aid the gentleman, that is a heavy burden. Not at all; God fits the back to it.&mdash;Tho' my wife is not able to do any out of door work, yet &s;he breeds up our children to &s;uch habits of indu&s;try that our little maids, before they are &s;ix years old can fir&s;t get a halfpenny, and then a penny a-day by knit|ting. The boys who are too little to do hard work, get a trifle by keeping the birds off the corn; for this the farmers will give them a penny or twopence, and now <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nd then a bit of bread and chee&s;e into the bargain.&mdash;When the &s;ea&s;on of crow-keeping is over, then they glean or pick &s;tones; any thing is better than idlene&s;s, &s;ir, and if they do not get a farthing by it, I would make them do it ju&s;t the &s;ame, for the &s;ake of giving them early habits of labor.</P>
<P>So you &s;ee, &s;ir, I am not &s;o badly off as many are; nay, it it were not that it co&s;ts me &s;o much in 'Peteca|ry's &s;tuff for my poor wife, I &s;hould reckon my&s;elf well off. Nay, I do reckon my&s;elf well off, for ble&s;&s;ed be God, he has granted her li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e to my prayers, and I would work my&s;elf to a 'nato<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">y, and live on one meal a-day to add any comfort to her valuable life; indeed I have of|ten done the la&s;t, and thought it no great matter nei|ther.</P>
<P>While they were in this part of the di&s;cour&s;e, a &s;ine p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">mp cherry-check little gul ran up out of breath, with a &s;ame on her young happy face, and, without taking any notice of the gentleman, cried out with great joy&mdash;Look here, father, only &s;ee how much I have got to|day! Mr. John&s;on was much &s;truck with her &s;implicity, but puzzled to know what was the occation of this great joy. On looking at her he perceived a &s;mall quan|tity of coar&s;e wool, &s;ome of which had found its way through the holes of her clean, but &s;canty and ragged wooll<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n apron.

Molly, now made a curt&s;ey down to the very ground; while Mr. John&s;on equired into the cau&s;e of the mu|tual &s;atisfaction which both father and daughter had ex|pre&s;&s;ed, at the unu&s;ual good fortune of the day.</P>
<P>Sir, &s;aid the &s;hepherd, poverty is a great &s;harpener of wits.&mdash;My wife and I cannot endure to &s;ee our children (poor as they are) without &s;hoes and &s;tockings, not on|ly on account of the pinching cold which cramps their poor little limbs, but becau&s;e it degrades and deba&s;es them; and poor people, who have but little regard to ap|pearances, will &s;eldom be found to have any great re|gard for hone&s;ty and goodne&s;s; I don't &s;ay this is al|ways the ca&s;e, but I am &s;ure it is &s;o too often. Now &s;hoes and &s;tockings being very dear, we could never af|ford to get them without a little contrivance. I mu&s;t &s;hew you how I manage about the &s;hoes, when you con|de&s;cend to call at our cottage, &s;ir; as to &s;tockings, this is one way we take to help get them. My young ones who are too little to do much work, &s;ometimes wander at odd hours over the hills for the chance of finding what little wool the &s;heep may drop when they rub them|&s;elves, as they are apt to do, in the bu&s;hes<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This piece of frugal indu&s;try is not imaginary, but a real fact, as is the character of the &s;hepherd, and his uncommon knowledge of the &s;criptures.</NOTE> The&s;e &s;cat|tered bits of wool the children pick out of the brambles, which, I &s;ee, have torn &s;ad holes in Molly's apron to|day; they carry this wool home, and when they have got a pretty parcel together, their mother cards it; for &s;he can &s;it and card in the chimney corner, when &s;he is not able to wa&s;h, or work about hou&s;e. The bigge&s;t, girl then &s;pins it; it does very well for us, without dye|ing, for poor people mu&s;t not &s;tand for the colour of
<PB N="11" REF="035296_0010_1001BFACE0960698">their &s;tockings. After this our little boys knit it for them&s;elves, while they are employed in keeping crows in the fields, and after they get home at night. As for the knitting the girls and their mother do, that is chief|ly for &s;ale, which helps to pay our rent.</P>
<P>Mr. John&s;on lifted up his eyes in &s;ilent a&s;toni&s;hment at the &s;hifts which hone&s;t poverty can make rather than beg or &s;teal, and was &s;urpri&s;ed to think how many ways of &s;ub&s;i&s;ting there are which tho&s;e who live at their ea&s;e little &s;u&s;pect. He &s;ecretly re&s;olved to be more attentive to his own petty expen&s;es than he had hither|to been, and to be more watchful that nothing was wa&s;t|ed in his family.</P>
<P>But to return to the &s;hepherd. Mr. John&s;on told him, that as he mu&s;t needs be at his friend's hou&s;e, who lived many miles off, that night, he could not, as he wi&s;hed to do, make a vi&s;it to his cottage at pre&s;ent.&mdash;But I will certainly do it, &s;aid he, on my return, for I long to &s;ee your w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> and her nice little family, and to be an eye-witne&s;s of her neatne&s;s and good manage|ment. The poor man's tears &s;tarted into his eyes on hearing the commendation be&s;towed on his wife; and wiping them off with the &s;leeve of his coat, for he was not worth a handkerchief in the world, he &s;aid&mdash;Oh! &s;ir, you ju&s;t now, I am afraid, called me an humble man, but indeed I am a very proud one. Proud! exclaimed Mr. John&s;on, I hope not&mdash;Pride is a g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters"> &s;in, and as the poor are liable to it as well as the rich, &s;o good a man as you &s;eem to be, ought to guard again&s;t it, Sir, &s;aid he, you are right but I am not proud of my&s;elf, God knows, I have nothing to be proud of. I am a poor &s;inner, but, indeed, &s;ir, I am proud of my wife:&mdash;She is not only the mo&s;t tidy, notable woman on the Plain, but &s;he is the kinde&s;t wife and mother, and the mo&s;t contented, thankful chri&s;tian that I know. La&s;t year I thought I &s;hould have lo&s;t her in a violent fit of the rheumati&s;m, caught by going to work too &s;oon af|ter
<PB N="12" REF="035296_0011_1001BFAF32171308">her lying in, I fear; for it is but a bleak coldi&s;h place, as you may &s;ee, &s;ir, in winter, and &s;ometimes the &s;now lies &s;o long under the hill, that I can hardly make my&s;elf a path to get out and buy a few nece&s;&s;aries in the next village; and we are afraid to &s;end out the children, for fear they &s;hould be lo&s;t when the &s;now is deep. So, as I was &s;aying, the poor &s;oul was very bad indeed, and for &s;everal weeks lo&s;t the u&s;e of all her limbs except her hands: a merciful Providence &s;pared her the u&s;e of the&s;e, &s;o that when &s;he could not turn in her bed, &s;he could contrive to patch a rag or two for her family. She was always &s;aying, had it not been for the great goodne&s;s of God, &s;he might have had the pal&s;y in&s;tead of the rheu|mati&s;m, and then &s;he could have done nothing&mdash;but nobody had &s;o many mercies as &s;he had.</P>
<P>I will not tell you what we &s;uffered during that bit|ter weather, &s;ir, but my wife's faith and patience dur|ing that trying time, were as good a le&s;&s;on to me as any &s;ermon I could hear, and yet Mr. Jenkins gave us very comfortable ones too, that helped to keep up my &s;pirits.</P>
<P>One Sunday afternoon, when my wife was at the wor&s;t, as I was coming out of church, for I went one part of the day, and my elde&s;t daughter the other, &s;o my poor wife was never left alone. As I was coming out of church, I &s;ay, Mr. Jenkins, the mini&s;ter, called out to me, and a&s;ked me how my wife did, &s;aying, he had been kept from coming to &s;ee her by the deep fall of &s;now, and, indeed, from the par&s;onage-hou&s;e to my hovel it was quite impa&s;&s;able. I gave him all the particulars he a&s;ked, and, I am afraid, a good many more, for my heart was quite full. He kindly gave me a &s;hilling, and &s;aid, he would certainly try to pick out his way and come and &s;ee her in a day or two.</P>
<P>While he was talking to me, a plain farmer-looking gentleman in boots, who &s;tood by, li&s;tening to all I &s;aid, but &s;eemed to take no notice. It was Mr. Jenkins's wife's father, who was come to pa&s;s the Chri&s;tmas ho|lidays
<PB N="13" REF="035296_0012_1001BFB44849F6A8">at the par&s;onage hou&s;e. I had always heard him &s;poken of as a plain frugal man, who lived clo&s;e him&s;elf, but was remarked to give away more than any of his &s;how-away neighbors.</P>
<P>Well! I went home with great &s;pirits at this &s;ea&s;on|able and unexpected &s;upply; for we had tapped our la&s;t &s;ixpence, and there was little work to be had on ac|count of the weather. I told my wife I was not come back empty-handed. No, I dare &s;ay not, &s;ays &s;he, you have been &s;erving a ma&s;ter "who filleth the hungry with good things, though he &s;endeth the rich empty a|way." True, Mary, &s;ays I; we &s;eldom fail to get good &s;piritual food from Mr. Jenkins, but to-day he has kind|ly &s;upplied our bodily wants. She was more thankful when I &s;howed her the &s;hilling, than, I dare &s;ay, &s;ome of your great people are when they get a hundred pounds.</P>
<P>Mr. John&s;on's heart &s;mote him when he heard &s;uch a value &s;et upon a &s;hilling; &s;urely, &s;aid he to him&s;elf, I will never wa&s;te another; but he &s;aid nothing to die &s;hepherd, who thus pur&s;ued his &s;tory.</P>
<P>Next morning before I went out, I &s;ent part of the money to buy a little ale and brown &s;ugar to put into her water-gruel, which you know, &s;ir, made it nice and nouri&s;hing. I went out to cleave wood in a farm-yard, for there was no &s;tanding out on the plain, after &s;uch a &s;now as had fallen in the night. I went with a lighter heart than u&s;ual, becau&s;e I had l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">t my poor wife a lit|tle better; and comfortably &s;upplied for this day, and I now re&s;olved more than ever to tru&s;t in God for the &s;upplies of the next. When I came back at night, my wife fell a crying as &s;oon as &s;he &s;aw me. This I own I thought but a bad return for the ble&s;&s;ings &s;he had &s;o lately received, and &s;o I told her. O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;aid &s;he, it is too much, we are too rich, I am now frightened, not le&s;t we &s;hould have no portion in this world, but for fear we &s;hould have our whole portion in it. Look here,
<PB N="14" REF="035296_0013_1001A30610126528">John! So &s;aying &s;he uncovered the bed whereon &s;he lay, and &s;hewed two warm, thick, new blankets. I could not believe my own eyes, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> becau&s;e when I went out in the morning, I had left her with no other covering than our little old thin blue rug. I was &s;till more a|mazed when &s;he put half a crown into my hand, telling me &s;he had had a vi&s;it from Mr. Jenkins and Mr. Jones, the latter of whom had be&s;towed all the&s;e good things upon us. Thus, &s;ir, have our lives been crowned with mercies. My wife got about again, and I do believe, under Providence, it was owing to the&s;e comforts; for the rheumati&s;m, &s;ir, without blankets by night and flan|nel by day, is but a baddi&s;h job, e&s;pecially to people who have little or no fire. She will always be a weakly bo|dy; but, thank God, her &s;oul pro&s;pers, and is in health. But I beg your pardon, &s;ir, for talking on at this rate.&mdash;Not at all, not at all, &s;aid Mr. John&s;on, I am much plea&s;ed with your &s;tory, you &s;hall certainly &s;ee me in a few days. Good night. So &s;aying, he &s;lipped a crown into his hand and rode off. Surely, &s;aid the &s;hepherd, <HI>goodne&s;s and mercy have followed me all the days of my life,</HI> as he gave the money to his wife when he got home at night.</P>
<P>As to Mr. John&s;on he found abundant matter for his thoughts during the re&s;t of his journey. On the whole he was more di&s;po&s;ed to envy than to pity the &s;hepherd. I have &s;eldom &s;een, &s;aid he, &s;o happy a man. It is a &s;ort of happine&s;s which the world could not give, and which, I plainly &s;ee, it has not been able to take a|way. This mu&s;t be the true &s;pirit of religion. I &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e more and more, that true goodne&s;s is not merely a thing of words and opinions, but a living principle brought into every common action of a man's life.

<HEAD>THE SHEPHERD OF SALISBURY PLAIN.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">PART II.</HEAD>
<P>I AM willing to hope that my readers will not be &s;orry to hear &s;ome farther particulars of their old acquaint|ance <HI>the Shepherd of Sali&s;bury Plain.</HI> They will call to mind that at the end of the fir&s;t part, he was return|ing home full of gratitude for the favors he had receiv|ed from Mr. John&s;on, whom we left pur&s;uing his jour|ney, after having promi&s;ed to make a vi&s;it to the &s;hep|herd's cottage.</P>
<P>Mr. John&s;on, after having pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome time with his friends, &s;at out on his return to Sali&s;bury, and on the Saturday evening reached a very &s;mall inn, a mile or two di&s;tant from the &s;hepherd's village; for he never travelled on a Sunday. He went the next morning to the church neare&s;t the hou&s;e, where he had pa&s;&s;ed the night; and after taking &s;uch refre&s;hment as he could g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t at that hou&s;e, he walked on to find out the &s;hep|herd's cottage. His rea&s;on for vi&s;iting him on a Sun|day was chiefly, becau&s;e he &s;uppo&s;ed it to be the only day which the &s;hepherd's employment allowed him to pa&s;s at home with his family, and as Mr. John&s;on had been &s;truck with his talk, he thought it would be nei|ther unplea&s;ant nor unprofitable to ob&s;erve how a man, who carried &s;uch an appearance of piety, &s;pent his Sun|day; for though he was &s;o low in the world, this gen|tleman
<PB N="17" REF="035296_0016_1001BFD20FA45948">was not above entering very clo&s;ely into his cha|racter, of which he thought he &s;hould be able to form a better judgment, by &s;eeing whether his practice at home kept pace with his profe&s;&s;ions abroad: for it is not &s;o much by ob&s;erving how people talk, as how they live, that we ought to judge of their characters.</P>
<P>After a plea&s;ant walk Mr. John&s;on got within &s;ight of the cottage, to which he was directed by the clump of hawthorns and the broken chimney. He wi&s;hed to take the family by &s;urpri&s;e; and walking gently up to the hou&s;e he &s;tood awhile to li&s;ten. The door being half open, he &s;aw the &s;hepherd, (who looked &s;o re&s;pec|table in his Sunday coat, that he &s;hould hardly have known him) his wife, and their numerous young fami|ly, draw round their little table, which was covered with a clean though very coar&s;e cloth. There &s;tood on it a large di&s;h of potatoes, a brown pitcher, and a piece of coar&s;e loaf. The wife and children &s;tood in &s;ilent at|tention, while the &s;hepherd, with uplifted hands and eyes, devoutly begged the ble&s;&s;ing of heaven on their homely fare. Mr. John&s;on could not help &s;ighing to reflect, that he had &s;ometimes &s;een better dinners eaten with le&s;s appearance of thankfulne&s;s.</P>
<P>The &s;hepherd and his wife then &s;at down with great &s;eeming cheerfulne&s;s, but the children &s;tood; and while the mother was helping them, little fre&s;h-coloured Mol|ly, who had picked the wool from the bu&s;hes with &s;o much delight, cried out, "Father, I wi&s;h I was big e|nough to &s;ay grace, I am &s;ure I &s;hould &s;ay it very heart|ily to-day, for I was thinking what mu&s;t <HI>poor</HI> people do who have no &s;alt to their potatoes, and do but look our di&s;h is quite full."&mdash;"This is the true way of thinking, Molly," &s;aid the father, "in whatever concerns bodily wants, and bodily comforts, it is our duty to compare our own lot with the lot of tho&s;e who are wor&s;e off, and this will keep us thankful. On the other hand, when|ever we are tempted to &s;et up our own wi&s;dom or good|ne&s;s,
<PB N="18" REF="035296_0017_1001BFD676BFBF40">we mu&s;t compare our&s;elves <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> tho&s;e who are wi&s;er and better, and that will keep u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">ble." Mol|ly was now &s;o hungry, and found the potatoes &s;o good, that &s;he had no time to make any more remarks; but was devouring her dinner very heartily, when the bark|ing of the great dog drew her attention from her tren|cher to the door, and &s;pying the &s;tranger, &s;he cried out, "Look father, &s;ee here, if yonder is not the good gen|tleman!" Mr. John&s;on finding him&s;elf di&s;covered, im|mediately walked in, and was heartily welcomed by the hone&s;t &s;hepherd, who told his wife that this was the gen|tleman to whom they were &s;o much obliged.</P>
<P>The good woman began, as &s;ome very neat people are rather too apt to do, with making many apologies that her hou&s;e was not cleaner, and that things was not in fitter order to receive &s;uch a gentleman. Mr. John&s;on, how|ever, on looking round, could di&s;cover nothing but the mo&s;t perfect neatne&s;s. The trenchers on which they were eating were almo&s;t as white as their linen; and, notwith&s;tanding the number and &s;mallne&s;s of the chil|dren, there was not the lea&s;t appearance of dirt or litter. The furniture was very &s;imple and poor, hardly indeed amounting to bare nece&s;&s;aries. It con&s;i&s;ted of four brown wooden chairs, which, by con&s;tant rubbing, were be|come as bright as a looking-gla&s;s; an iron pot and ket|tle; a poor old grate which &s;carcely held a handful of coals, and out of which the little fire that had been in it appeared to have been taken, as &s;oon as it had an&s;wered the end for which it had been lighted, that of boiling their potatoes. Over the chimney &s;tood an old fa&s;hion|ed broad bright candle&s;tick, and a &s;till brighter &s;pit; it was pretty clear that this la&s;t was kept rather for orna|ment than u&s;e. An old carved elbow chair, and a che&s;t of the &s;ame date, which &s;tood in the corner, were con|&s;idered as the mo&s;t valuable part of the &s;hepherd's goods, having been in his family for three generations. But all the&s;e were lightly e&s;teemed by him, in compari&s;on of a|nother
<PB N="19" REF="035296_0018_1001BFDA9175C9A0">po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, which added to the above, made up the whole of what he had inherited from his father; and which la&s;t he would not have parted with, if no other could have been had, for a king's ran&s;om: this was a large old Bible, which lay on the wind<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">w &s;eat, neatly covered with brown cloth, variou&s;ly pat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ed.

On the clean white walls were pa&s;ted a hymn on the crucifix|ion of our Saviour, a print of the prodigal &s;on, the &s;hep|herd's hymn, and a <HI>New Hi&s;tory of a True Book.</HI></P>
<P>After the fir&s;t &s;alutations were over, Mr. John&s;on &s;aid, that if they would go on quietly with their dinner he would &s;it down. Though a good deal a&s;hamed, they thought it more re&s;pectful to obey the gentleman, who having ca&s;t his eye on their &s;lender provitions, gently re|baked the &s;hepherd for not having indulged him&s;elf, as it was Sunday, with a mor&s;el of bacon to reli&s;h his po|tatoes. The &s;hepherd &s;aid nothing, but poor Mary co|loured and hung down her head, &s;aying, "indeed, &s;ir, it is not my fault, I did beg my hu&s;band to allow him&s;elf a bit of meat to-day out of your honor's bounty; but he was too good to do it, and it is all for my &s;ake."&mdash;The &s;hepherd &s;eemed unwilling to come to an explana|tion, but Mr. John&s;on de&s;ired Mary to go on. So &s;he continued, "you mu&s;t know, &s;ir, that both of us, next to a &s;in, dread a debt, and indeed, in &s;ome ca&s;es, a debt is a &s;in; but with all our care and p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ins we have never been able quite to pay off the doctor's bill, for that bad fit of the rheumati&s;m which I had la&s;t winter. Now when you were plea&s;ed to give my hu&s;band that kind pre&s;ent the other day, I heartily de&s;ired him to buy a bit of meat for Sunday, as I &s;aid before, that he might have a little ref<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;hment for him&s;elf out of your kindne&s;s.&mdash;But an&s;wered he, Mary, it is never out of my mind long together that we &s;till owe a few &s;hillings to the doctor,
<PB N="20" REF="035296_0019_1001BFDC173E8FC0">(and thank God it is all we did owe in the world.)&mdash;Now if I carry him this money directly, it will not on|ly &s;hew him our hone&s;ty and our good will, but it will be an encouragement to him to come to you another time in ca&s;e you &s;hould be taken once more in &s;uch a bad &s;it; for I mu&s;t own, added my poor hu&s;band, that the thought of your being &s;o terribly ill without any help, is the only misfortune that I want courage to face."</P>
<P>Here the grateful woman's tears ran down &s;o fa&s;t that &s;he could not go on. She wiped them with the corner of her apron, and humbly begged pardon for making &s;o free. "Indeed, &s;ir," &s;aid the &s;hepherd, "tho' my wife is full as unwilling to be in debt as my&s;elf, yet I could hardly prevail on her to con&s;ent to my paying this money ju&s;t then, becau&s;e, &s;he &s;aid, it was hard I &s;hould not have a ta&s;te of the gentleman's bounty my|&s;elf. But for once, &s;ir, I would have my own way.&mdash;For you mu&s;t know, as I pa&s;s be&s;t part of my time a|lone, tending my &s;heep, 'tis a great point with me, &s;ir, to get comfortable matter for my own thoughts; &s;o that 'tis rather &s;elf-intere&s;t in me to allow my&s;elf no plea&s;ures and no practices that won't bear thinking on over and over. For when one is a good deal alone, you know &s;ir, all one's bad deeds do &s;o ru&s;h in upon one, as I may &s;ay, and &s;o torment one, that there is no true comfort to be had but in keeping clear of wrong doings, and fal&s;e plea&s;ures; and that I &s;uppo&s;e may be one rea&s;on why &s;o many folks hate to &s;tay a bit by them&s;elves. But as I was &s;aying, when I came to think the matter over on the hill yonder, &s;aid I to my&s;elf, a good dinner is a good thing I grant, and yet it will be but cold comfort to me a week after, to be able to &s;ay&mdash;to be &s;ure I had a nice &s;houlder of mutton la&s;t Sun|day for dinner, thanks to the good gentleman, but then I am in debt&mdash;I <HI>had</HI> a rare dinner, that's certain, but the plea&s;ure of that has long been over, and the debt &s;till remains&mdash;I have &s;pent the crown, and now if my poor wife &s;hould be taken in one of tho&s;e fits again, die

This thought &s;ettled all; and I &s;et off directly and paid the crown to the doctor with as mu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h cheerfulne&s;s as I &s;hould have felt on &s;itting down to the fatte&s;t &s;houlder of mutton that ever was roa&s;ted. And if I was contented at the time, think how much more happy I have been at the remembrance! O &s;ir, there are no plea&s;ures worth the name but &s;uch as bring no plague or penitence after them."</P>
<P>Mr. John&s;on was &s;atisfied with the &s;hepherd's rea|&s;ons; and agreed, that though a good dinner was not to be de&s;pi&s;ed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">et it was not worthy to be compared with <HI>a contented mind, which</HI> (as the Bible truly &s;ays) <HI>is a continual fea&s;t."</HI> "But come," &s;aid the good gen|tleman, "what have we got in this brown mug?"&mdash;"As good water," &s;aid the &s;hepherd, "as any in the king's dominions. I have heard of countries beyond &s;ea in which there is no whole&s;ome water; nay, I have been my&s;elf in a great town not far off where they are obliged to buy all the water they get, while a good Pro|vidence &s;ends to my very door a &s;pring as clear and fine as Jacob's well. When I am tempted to repine that I have often no other drink, I call to mind, that it was nothing better than a cup of cold water which the wo|man of Samaria drew for the greate&s;t gue&s;t that ever vi|&s;ited this world."</P>
<P>"Very well," replied Mr. John&s;on; "but as your hone&s;ty has made you prefer a poor meal to being in debt, I will at lea&s;t &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nd and get &s;omething for you to drink. I &s;aw a little public hou&s;e ju&s;t by the church, as I came along. Let that little ro&s;y-faced fellow fetch a mug of beer."</P>
<P>So &s;aying he looked full at the boy, who did not of|fer to &s;tir; but ca&s;t an eye at his father to know what he was to do. "Sir," &s;aid the &s;hepherd, "I hope we &s;hall not appear ungrateful if we &s;eem to refu&s;e your fa|vo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> my little boy would, I am &s;ure, fly to &s;erve you
<PB N="22" REF="035296_0021_1001BFE85A59F8C0">on any other occa&s;ion. But, good &s;ir, it is Sunday, and &s;hould any of my family be &s;een at a public hou&s;e on a Sabbath-day, it would be a much greater grief to me than to drink water all my life. I am often talking a|gain&s;t the&s;e doings to others, and if I &s;hould &s;ay one thing and do another, you can't think what an advan|tage it would give many of my neighbors over me, who would be glad enough to report that they caught the &s;hepherd's &s;on at the ale-hou&s;e, without explaining how it happened. Chri&s;tians, you know, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, mu&s;t be doubly watchful, or they will not only bring di&s;grace on them|&s;elves, but what is much wor&s;e, on that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ly name by which they are called."</P>
<P>"Are you not a little too cautious, my hone&s;t friend?" &s;aid Mr. John&s;on. "I humbly a&s;k your pardon, &s;ir," replied the &s;hepherd, "if I think that is impo&s;&s;ible. In my poor notion I no more under&s;tand how a man can be too cautious, than how he can be too &s;trong, or too healthy."</P>
<P>"You are right, indeed," &s;aid Mr. John&s;on, "as a general principle, but this &s;truck me as a very &s;mall thing." "Sir," &s;aid the &s;hepherd, "I am afraid you will think me very bold, but you encourage me to &s;peak out." "'Tis what I wi&s;h," &s;aid the gentleman.&mdash;"Then, &s;ir," re&s;umed the &s;hepherd, "I doubt if, where there is a temptation to do wrong, any thing can be called &s;mall; that is, in &s;hort, if there is any &s;uch thing as a &s;mall wilful &s;in. A poor man, like me, is &s;eldom called out to do great things, &s;o that it is not by a few great deeds his character can be judged by his neighbors, but by the little round of daily cu&s;toms he allows him&s;elf in."&mdash;While they were thus talking, the children, who had &s;tood very quietly behind, and had not &s;tirred a foot, now began to &s;camper about all at once, and in a moment r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n to the window-&s;eat to pick up their little old hats. Mr. John&s;on looked &s;urprized at this di&s;turbance; the &s;hepherd a&s;ked his pardon, tell|ing
<PB N="23" REF="035296_0022_1001BFEF0FBD30A8">him it was the &s;ound of the church bell which had been the cau&s;e of their rudene&s;s: for their mother had brought them up with &s;uch fear of being too late for church, that it was but who could catch the fir&s;t &s;troke of the bell, and be fir&s;t ready. He had always taught them to think that nothing was more indecent than to get into church after it was begun; for as the &s;ervice opened with an exhortation to repentance, and a con|fe&s;&s;ion of &s;in, it looked very pre&s;umptuous not to be ready to join in it&mdash;it looked as if people did not feel them&s;elves to be &s;inners. And though &s;uch as lived at a great di&s;tan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> might plead difference of clocks as an excu&s;e, yet tho&s;e who lived within the &s;ound of the bell, could pretend neither ignorance nor mi&s;take.</P>
<P>Mary and her children &s;et forward. Mr. John&s;on and the &s;hepherd followed, taking care to talk the whole way on &s;uch &s;ubjects as might fit them for the &s;olemn duties of the place to which they were going. "I have often been &s;orry to ob&s;erve," &s;aid Mr. John&s;on, "that many who are reckoned decent, good kind of people, and who would on no account neglect going to church, yet &s;eem to care but little in what frame or temper of mind they go thither. They will talk of their worldly concerns till they get within the door, and then take them up again the very minute the &s;ermon is over, which makes me ready to fear they lay too much &s;tre&s;s on the mere form of going to a place of wor&s;hip. Now, for my part, I always find that it requires a little time to bring my mind into a &s;tate fit to do any <HI>common</HI> bu|&s;ine&s;s well, much more this great and mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary bu&s;ine&s;s of all." "Yes &s;ir," &s;aid the &s;hepherd, "and t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">en I think too how bu&s;y I &s;hould be in preparing my mind, if I was going into the pre&s;ence of a great gen|tleman, or a lord, or the king; and &s;hall the King of Kings be treated with le&s;s re&s;pect?

<P>After &s;ervice, Mr. Jenkins, the clergyman, who was well acquanted with the character of Mr. John&s;on, and had a great re&s;pect for him, acco&s;ted him with much ci|vility; expre&s;&s;ing his concern that he could not enjoy ju&s;t now &s;o much of his conver&s;ation as he wi&s;hed, as he was obliged to vi&s;it a per&s;on at a di&s;tance, but hoped to have a little talk with him before he left the village.&mdash;As they walked along together, Mr. John&s;on made &s;uch enquiries about the &s;hepherd, as &s;erved to confirm him in the high opinion he entertained <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">f his piety, good &s;en&s;e, indu&s;try, and &s;elf-denial. They parted, the cler|gyman promi&s;ing to call in at the cottage in his way home.</P>
<P>The &s;hepherd, who took it for granted that Mr. John|&s;on was gone to the par&s;onage, walked home with his wife and children, and was begining in his u&s;ual way to catechi&s;e and in&s;truct his family, when Mr. John&s;on came in, and in&s;i&s;ted that the &s;hepherd &s;hould go on with his in&s;tructions, ju&s;t as if he were not there.&mdash;This gentleman, who was very de&s;irous of being u&s;eful to his own &s;ervants and workmen in the way of reli|gious in&s;truction, was &s;ometimes &s;orry to find that tho' he took a good deal of pains, they did not now and then quite under&s;tand him, for though his meaning was very good, the language was not always very plain; and though the <HI>things</HI> he &s;aid were not hard to be under|&s;tood, yet the <HI>words</HI> were, e&s;pecially to &s;uch as were very ignorant. And he now began to find out, that if people were ever &s;o wi&s;e and good, yet if they had not a &s;imple, agreeable, and familiar way of expre&s;&s;ing them|&s;elves, &s;ome of their plain hearers would not be much the better for them. For this rea&s;on he was not above li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tening to the plain humble way in which this hone&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">n caught his family, for though he knew that he him|&s;elf had many advan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ages over the &s;hepherd, had more
<PB N="25" REF="035296_0024_1001BFF7674E2DF8">learning, and could teach him many things, yet he was not too proud to learn even of &s;o poor a man, in any point where he thought the &s;hepherd might have the ad|vantage of him.</P>
<P>This gentleman was much plea&s;ed with the know|ledge and piety he di&s;covered in the an&s;wers of the children; and de&s;ired the &s;hepherd to tell him how he contrived to keep a &s;en&s;e of divine things in his own mind and in that of his family with &s;o little lei&s;ure and &s;o little reading. "O as to that, &s;ir," &s;aid the &s;hepherd, "we do not read much except in one book to be &s;ure; but by hearty prayer for God's ble&s;&s;ing on the u&s;e of that book, what little knowledge is needful &s;eems to come of cour&s;e, as it were. And my chief &s;tudy has been to bring the fruits of the Sunday reading into the week's bu&s;ine&s;s, and to keep up the &s;ame &s;en&s;e of God in the heart, when the bible is in the cupboard as when it is in the hand. In &s;hort to apply what I read in the book, to what I meet with in the field."</P>
<P>"I don't quite under&s;tand you," &s;aid Mr. John&s;on, "Sir," replied the &s;hepherd, "I have but a poor gift at conveying the&s;e things to others, though I have much comfort from them in my own mind; but I am &s;ure that the mo&s;t ignorant and hard working people, who are in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">arne&s;t about their &s;alvation, may help to keep up de|vout thoughts and good affections during the week, though they have harely any time to look at a book.&mdash;And it will help them to keep out bad thoughts too, which is no &s;mall matter.

<P>"You are happy," &s;aid Mr. John&s;on, "in this reti|red life by which you e&s;cape the corruptions of the world." "Sir," &s;aid the &s;hepherd, "I do not e&s;cape the corruptions of my own evil nature. Even there on that wild &s;olitary hill, I can find out that my heart is prone to evil thoughts. I &s;uppo&s;e, &s;ir, that different &s;tates have different temptations. You great folks that live in the world, perhaps are expo&s;ed to &s;ome, of which &s;uch a poor man as I am, know nothing. But to one who leads a lonely life like me, evil thoughts are a chief be&s;etting &s;in; and I can no more with&s;tand the&s;e with|out the grace of God, than a rich gentleman can with|&s;tand the &s;nares of evil company, without the &s;ame grace. And I feel that I &s;tand in need of God's help continually, and if he &s;hould give me up to my own evil heart I &s;hould be lo&s;t."</P>
<P>Mr. John&s;on approved of the &s;hepherd's &s;incerity, for he had always ob&s;erved that where there was no hu|mility, and no watchfulne&s;s again&s;t &s;in, there was no re|ligion, and he &s;aid that the man who did not feel him|&s;elf to be a &s;inner in his opinion, could not be a chris|tian.</P>

Ju&s;t as they were in this part of their di&s;cour&s;e, Mr. Jenkins, the clergyman came in. After the u&s;ual &s;alu|tations, he &s;aid, "Well Shepherd, I wi&s;h you joy; I know you will be &s;orry to gain any advantage by the death of a neighbor; but old Wil&s;on my clerk, was &s;o infirm, and I tru&s;t &s;o well prepared, that there is no rea|&s;on to be &s;orry for his death.

<P>"No great matter, &s;ir," cried the &s;hepherd, "in|deed it is a great thing to me; it will more than pay my rent. Ble&s;&s;ed be God for all his goodne&s;s." Mary &s;aid nothing, but lifted up her eyes full of tears in &s;ilent gratitude.</P>
<P>"I am glad of this little circum&s;tance," &s;aid Mr. Jenkins, "not only for your &s;ake, but for the &s;ake of the office it&s;elf.

<P>Mr. John&s;on now inquired of the clergyman, whe|ther there were many children in the pari&s;h. "More than you would expect," replied he "from the &s;eem|ing &s;mallne&s;s of it, but there are &s;ome little hamlets which you do not &s;ee." "I think," returned Mr. John|&s;on, "I recollect that in the conver&s;ation I had with the &s;hepherd on the hill yonder, he told me you had no Sunday &s;chool." "I am &s;orry to &s;ay we have none," &s;aid the mini&s;ter; "I do what I can to remedy this misfortune by public chatechi&s;ing; but having two or three churches to &s;erve, I cannot give &s;o much time as I wi&s;h to private in&s;truction; and having a large fami|ly

<HEAD>THE HISTORY OF <HI>TOM WHITE,</HI> THE POSTILION.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">PART I.</HEAD>
<P>TOM WHITE, was one of the be&s;t drivers of a po&s;t-chai&s;e on the Bath road.&mdash;Tom was the &s;on of an hone&s;t laborer at a little village in Wilt&s;hire: he was an active indu&s;trious boy, and as &s;oon as he was big enough he left his father, who was burthened with a numerous family, and went to live with Farmer Hod|ges, a &s;ober worthy man in the &s;ame village. He drove the waggon all the week, and on Sundays, though he was now grown up, the farmer required him to attend the Sunday &s;chool, carried on under the in&s;pection of Dr. Shepherd, the worthy vicar, and always made him read his Bible in the evening, after he had &s;erved his bea&s;ts, and would have turned him out of his &s;ervice if he had even gone to the alchou&s;e for his own plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>Tom, by earring &s;ome waggon-loads of faggots to the Bear Inn at Devizes, &s;oon made many acquaintan|ces in the &s;table-yard. He compared his own cotter's frock, and &s;hoes thick &s;et with nails, with the &s;mart red j<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cket and tight boots of the po&s;t-boys, and grew a|&s;ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">l of his own homely dre&s;s; he was re&s;olved to drive a chai&s;e, to g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t money, and to &s;ee the world.&mdash;
<PB N="32" REF="035296_0031_1001C01AA4C642C8">Fooli&s;h fellow! he never con&s;idered, that, though it is true, a waggoner works hard all day, yet he gets a qui|et evening, and undi&s;turbed re&s;t at night. However as there mu&s;t he chai&s;e-boys as well as plough-boys, there was no great harm in the change. The evil company to which it expo&s;ed him, was the chief mi&s;chief. He left farmer Hodges though not without &s;orrow at quit|ting &s;o kind a ma&s;ter, and got him&s;elf hired at the Black Bear.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the temptations to which he was now expo&s;ed, Tom's good education &s;tood by him for &s;ome time. At fir&s;t he was frightened to hear the oaths and wicked words which are too often uttered in a &s;ta|ble-yard. However, though he thought it wrong, he had not the courage to reprove it, and the next &s;top to being ea&s;y at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">eing others &s;in, is to &s;in our&s;elves. By degrees he began to think it manly, and a mark of &s;pi|rit in others to &s;wear; though the force of good habit was &s;o &s;trong, that at fir&s;t when he &s;wore him&s;elf it was with &s;ear and in a low voice. But he was &s;oon laughed out of his &s;heepi&s;hne&s;s, as they called it; and though he never became &s;o prophane and bla&s;phemous as &s;ome of his companions, (for he never &s;wore in cool blood or in mirth as &s;o many do,) yet he would too often u&s;e a dreadful bad word when he was in a pa&s;&s;ion with his hor&s;es. And here I cannot but drop a hint on the great folly as well as wickedne&s;s of being in a great rage with poor bea&s;ts, who not having the gift of rea&s;on, cannot be moved like human creatures, with all the wicked words that are &s;aid to them; but who unhappily ha|ving the gift of feeling, &s;uffer as much as human crea|tures can do, at the cruel and unnece&s;&s;ary beatings given them. He had been bred up to think that drunken|ne&s;s was a great &s;in, for he never &s;aw farmer Hodges drunk in his life, and where a farmer is &s;ober, his men are le&s;s likely to drink, or if they do, the ma&s;ter can re|prove them with the better grace.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="035296_0032_1001C01EC5E8CD58">
Tom was not naturally fond of drink, yet for the &s;ake of being thought merry company, and a hearty fellow, he often drank more than he ought. As he had been u&s;ed to go to church twice on a Sunday whole he lived with the farmer, who &s;eldom u&s;ed his hor&s;es on that day except to carry his wife to church behind him, Tom felt a little unea&s;y when he was &s;ent the very fir&s;t Sunday a long journey with a great family; for I can|not conceal the truth, that too many gentlefolks will travel when there is no nece&s;&s;ity for it on a Sunday, and when Monday would an&s;wer the end ju&s;t as well. This is a great grief to all good and &s;ober people, both rich and poor. However he kept his thoughts to him|&s;elf, though he could not now and then help thinking how quietly things were going on at the farmer's, who&s;e waggoner on a Sunday led as ea&s;y a life as if he had been a gentleman. But he &s;oon lo&s;t all thoughts of this kind, and did not know a Sunday from a Monday. Tom went on pro&s;perou&s;ly, as it is called, for three or four years, got plenty of money, but &s;aved not a &s;hil|ling. As &s;oon as his hor&s;es were once in the &s;table, whoever would might &s;ee them fed for Tom.&mdash;He had other fi&s;h to fry.&mdash;Fives, cards, cudgel playing, laying wagers, and keeping loo&s;e company, each of which he at fir&s;t di&s;liked, and then practi&s;ed, ran away with all his money, and all his &s;pare time; and though he was generally in the way as &s;oon as the hor&s;es were ready, (becau&s;e if there was no driving there was no pay,) yet he did not care whether the carriage was clean or the hor&s;es looked well, if the harne&s;s was whole, or the hor|&s;es were &s;hod. The certainty that the gains of to-mor|row would make up for the extravagance of to-day, made him quite thoughtle&s;s and happy, for he was young, active, and healthy, and never fore&s;aw that a rainy day might come, when he would want what he now &s;quan|dered away.</P>
<P>One day being a little flu&s;tered with liquor as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e was
<PB N="34" REF="035296_0033_1001A32C1DA4CA78">driving his return chai&s;e through Brentford, he &s;aw ju&s;t before him another empty carriage, driven by one of his acquaintances: he whipped up his hor&s;es, re&s;olving to out&s;trip the other, and &s;wearing dreadfully that he would be at the Red Lyon fir&s;t&mdash;for a pint&mdash;done, cried the other&mdash;a wager.&mdash;Both cut and &s;purred the poor bea&s;ts with the u&s;ual fury, as if their credit had been really at &s;take, or their lives had depended on this fool|i&s;h conte&s;t. Tom's chai&s;e had now got up to that of his rival, and they drove along-&s;ide of each other with great fury and many imprecations. But, in a narrow part, Tom's chai&s;e being in the middle, with his antag|oni&s;t on one &s;ide, and a cart driving again&s;t him on the other, the hor&s;es reared, the carriages got entangled, Tom roared out a great oath to the other to &s;top, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> either could not, or would not do, but returned a hor|rid imprecation that he would win the wager if he was alive. Tom's hor&s;es took fright, and he was thrown to the ground with great violence. As &s;oon as he could be got from under the wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">s, he was taken up &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;e|le&s;s; his leg was broke in two places, and his body much brui&s;ed. Some people whom the noi&s;e had bro't together, put him into the po&s;t-chai&s;e, in which the wag|goner kindly a&s;&s;i&s;ted, but the other driver &s;eemed care|le&s;s and indifferent, and drove off, ob&s;erving with a bru|tal coolne&s;s, "I am &s;orry I have lo&s;t my pint; I &s;hould have beat him hollow, had it not been for this <HI>little ac|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">at.</HI>" Some gentlemen who came out of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">n, af|ter reprimanding this &s;avage, inquired who he was, wrote to inform his ma&s;ter, and got hun di&s;charged: re&s;olving that neither they, nor any of their friends, would ever employ him, and he was long out of place.</P>
<P>Tom was taken to one of tho&s;e excellent ho&s;pitals with which London abounds. His agonies were dread|ful, his leg was &s;et, and a high fever came on. As &s;oon as he was left alone to reflect on his condition, his fir&s;t thought was that he &s;hould die, and his horror was in|conceivable.&mdash;"Alas!"
<PB N="35" REF="035296_0034_1001C02C6488E7C0">&s;aid he, "what will become of my poor &s;oul? I am cut off in the very commi&s;&s;ion of three great &s;ins:&mdash;I was dr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">k, I was in a horrible pa&s;&s;ion, and I had oaths and bla&s;phemies in my mouth."&mdash;He tried to pray, but he could not, his mind was all di&s;traction, and he thought he was &s;o very wicked that God would not forgive him: "becau&s;e," &s;ays he, "I have &s;inned again&s;t light and knowledge, and a &s;ober e|ducation, and good examples, and I de&s;erve nothing but puni&s;hment."&mdash;At length he grew light-headed, and there was little hopes of his life. Whenever he came to his &s;en&s;es for a few minutes, he cried out, "O that my old companions could now &s;ee me, &s;urely they would take warning by my &s;ad &s;ate, and repent before it is too late."</P>
<P>By the ble&s;&s;ing of God, on the &s;kill of the &s;urgeon, and the care of the nur&s;es, he however grew better in a few days. And here let me &s;top to remark, what a mer|cy it is that we live in a chri&s;tian country, where the poor, when &s;ick, or lame, or wounded, are taken as much care of as any gentry; nay, in &s;ome re&s;pects, more, becau&s;e in ho&s;pitals and infirmaries there are more doctors and &s;urgeons to attend, than mo&s;t private gentle-folks can afford to have at their own hou&s;es, whereas <HI>there never was an ho&s;pital in the whole heathen world.</HI> Ble&s;&s;ed be God for this, among the thou&s;and other excellent fruits of the CHRISTIAN RELIGION!</P>
<P>It was eight weeks before Tom could be taken out of bed. This was a happy affliction; for this long &s;ick|ne&s;s and &s;olitude gave him time to reflect on his pa&s;t life. He began &s;eriou&s;ly to hate tho&s;e darling &s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s which had brought him to the brink of ruin. He could now pray heartily; he confe&s;&s;ed and lamented his iniquities with many tears, and began to hope that the mercies of God, through the merits of a Redeemer, might yet be extended to him on his &s;incere repentance. He re&s;olved never more to return to the &s;ame evil cour&s;es, but he
<PB N="36" REF="035296_0035_1001C032C85291C8">did not tru&s;t in his own &s;trength, but prayed that God would give him grace for the future, as well as p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters"> for the pa&s;t. He remembered, and he was hu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the thought, that he u&s;ed to have &s;hort fits of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> and to form re&s;olutions of amendment, in his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">d thoughtle&s;s days, and often when he had a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ache after a drinking bout, or had lo&s;t his money a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">l-fours, he vowed never to drink or play again. But as &s;oon as his head was well or his pockets recruited, he forgot all his re&s;olutions. And how &s;hould it be otherwi&s;e? for he tru&s;ted in his own &s;trength, he never prayed to God to &s;trengthen him, nor even avoided the next tempta|tion.</P>
<P>The ca&s;e was now different. Tom began to find that <HI>his &s;trength was perfect weakne&s;s,</HI> and that he could do nothing without the divine a&s;&s;i&s;tance, for which he pray|ed heartily and con&s;tantly. He &s;ent home for his Bible, and Prayer-book, which he had not opened for two years, and which had been given him when he left the Sunday &s;chool. He &s;pent the chief part of his time in reading them, and thus derived great comfort, as well as great knowledge. The &s;tudy of the Bible filled his heart with gratitude to God, who had not cut him off in the mid&s;t of his &s;ins, but given him &s;pace for repent|ance; and the agonies he had lately &s;uffered with his broken leg increa&s;ed his thankfulne&s;s, that he had e&s;cap|ed the more dreadful pain of eternal mi&s;ery. And here let the remark what encouragement this is for rich peo|ple to give away Bibles and good books, and not to lo&s;e all hope, though for a time they &s;ee little or no good effect from it. According to all appearance, Tom's were never likely to do him any good, and yet his generous benefactor, who had ca&s;t his bread upon the waters, found it after many days, for this Bible which had lain untouched for years, was at la&s;t made the means of h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> reformation. God will work in his own good time.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as he got well, and wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> di&s;charged from the
<PB N="37" REF="035296_0036_1001C0367507F938">ho&s;pital, Tom began to think he mu&s;t return to get his bread. At fir&s;t he had &s;ome &s;cruples about going back to his old employ; but, &s;ays he, &s;en&s;ibly enough, gen|tlefolks mu&s;t travel, travellers mu&s;t have chai&s;es, and chai&s;es mu&s;t have drivers; it is a very hone&s;t calling, and I don't know that goodne&s;s belongs to one &s;ort of bu&s;ine&s;s more than another: and he who can be good in a &s;tate of great temptation, provided the calling be lawful, and the temptations are not of his own &s;eeking, and he be diligent in prayer, may be better than another man for aught I know; and <HI>all that belongs to us is to do our duty in that &s;tate of life in which it &s;hall plea&s;e God to call us.</HI> Tom had rubbed up his catechi&s;m at the ho&s;pital, and it is a pity that people don't look at their catechi&s;m &s;ometimes when they are grown up; for it is full as good for men and w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">en as it is for chil|dren; nay, better, for though the an&s;wers contained in it are intended for children to <HI>repeat,</HI> yet the duties en|joined in it are intended for men and women to put in <HI>practice.</HI></P>
<P>Tom now felt grieved that he was obliged to drive on Sundays. But people who are in earne&s;t, and have their hearts in a thing, can find helps in all ca&s;es. As &s;oon as he had &s;et down his company at their &s;tage, and had &s;een his hor&s;es fed, &s;ays Tom, "A man who takes care of his hor&s;es will generally think it right to let them re&s;t an hour or two at lea&s;t. In every town it is a chance but there may be a church open during part of that time. If the prayers &s;hould be over, I'll try hard for the &s;ermon; and if I dare not &s;tay to the &s;ermon, it is a chance but I may catch the prayers; it is worth trying for, however; and as I u&s;ed to make nothing of making a pu&s;h, for the &s;ake of getting an hour to gamble, I need not grudge to take a little pains extraordinary to &s;erve God. By this watchfulne&s;s he &s;oon got <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o know <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> hours of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">vice at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ns on the road he tra|v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">, and while the hor&s;es <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> I can went to church;
<PB N="39" REF="035296_0037_1001C03A9E03F9A8">and it became a favorite proverb with him, that <HI>prayers and provender hinder no man's journey.</HI></P>
<P>At fir&s;t his companions wanted to laugh and make &s;port of this; but when they &s;aw that no lad on the road was up &s;o early or worked &s;o hard as Tom; when they &s;aw no chai&s;e &s;o neat, no gla&s;&s;es &s;o bright, no har|ne&s;s &s;o tight, no driver &s;o diligent, &s;o clean, or &s;o civil, they found he was no &s;ubject to make &s;port at. Tom indeed was very careful in looking after the linch pine, in never giving his hor&s;es too much water when they were hot; nor, whatever was his ha&s;te, would be ever gallop them up hill, &s;trike them acro&s;s the head, or when tired, cut and &s;la&s;h them in driving on the &s;tones, as &s;oon as he got into a town, as &s;ome fooli&s;h fellows do. What helped to cure Tom of the&s;e bad practices, was that remark he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> with in the Bible, that <HI>a good man is merciful to his bea&s;t.</HI> He was much moved on reading the prophet Jonah, to ob&s;erve what compa&s;&s;ion the great God of heaven and earth had for poor bea&s;ts: for one of the rea&s;ons there given, why the Almighty was unwilling to de&s;troy the great city of Ninevah was, <HI>becau&s;e there was much cattle in it.</HI> After this, Tom never could bear to &s;ee a wanton &s;troke inflicted.</P>
<P>Tom &s;oon grew rich for one in his &s;tation; for eve|ry gentleman on the road would be driven by no other l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> if <HI>careful Tom</HI> was to be had. Being diligent, he <HI>got</HI> a great deal of money; being frugal, he <HI>&s;pent</HI> but little; and having no vices, he <HI>wa&s;ted</HI> none. He &s;oon found out that there was &s;ome meaning in that text which &s;ays, that <HI>Godline&s;s hath the promi&s;e of the lif<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> that now is, as well as of that which is to come:</HI> for the &s;ame principles which makes a man &s;ober and hone&s;t, have al&s;o a natural tendency to make him healthy and rich; while a d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters"> and a &s;pendthrift <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> hardly es|cape being &s;ick, and a beggar in the end.

<P>After a few years Tom begged a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ay, and made
<PB N="39" REF="035296_0038_1001C03F806B5C60">a vi&s;it to his native village: his good character had got thither before him. He found his father was dead, but during his long illne&s;s Tom had &s;upplied him with mo|ney, and by allowing him a trifle every week, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">d had the hone&s;t &s;atisfaction of keeping him from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> pari&s;h. Farmer Hodges was &s;till living, but being grown old and infirm, he was de&s;irous to retire from bu&s;ine&s;s. He retained a great regard for his old &s;ervant, Tom; and finding he was worth money, and knowing he knew &s;omething of country bu&s;ine&s;s, he offered to let him a &s;mall farm at an ea&s;y rate, and promi&s;ed his a&s;&s;i&s;tance in the management for the fir&s;t year, with the loan of a &s;mall &s;um of money, that he might &s;et out with a pretty &s;tock. Tom thanked h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> with tears in his eyes, went back and took a hand&s;ome leave of his ma&s;ter, who made him a pre&s;ent of a hor&s;e and cart, in acknowledgement of his long and faithful &s;ervices; for, &s;ays he, "I have &s;aved many hor&s;es by Tom's care and attention, and I could well afford to do the &s;ame by every &s;ervant who did the &s;ame by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e; and &s;hould be a richer man at the end o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> every year by the &s;ame genero&s;ity, provided I could meet with ju&s;t and faithful &s;ervants who de&s;erved the &s;ame rewards."</P>
<P>Tom was &s;oon &s;ettled in his new farm, and in le&s;s than a year had got every thing neat and decent about him. Farmer Hodges' long experience and friendly advice, joined to his own indu&s;try and hard labor, &s;oon bro't the farm to great perfection. The regularity, &s;obriety, peaceablene&s;s, and piety of his daily life, his con&s;tant attendance at church twice every Sunday, and his de|cent and devout behavior when there, &s;oon recommend|ed him to the notice of Dr. Shepherd, who was &s;till li|ving, a pattern of zeal, activity, and benevolence to all pari&s;h prie&s;ts. The Dr. &s;oon begun to hold up Tom, or as we mu&s;t now more properly ter<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> him, Mr. Tho|mas White, to the imitation of the whole pari&s;h, and the frequent and conde&s;cending conver&s;ation of this

<P>Farmer White &s;oon found out that a dairy could not well he carried on without a mi&s;tre&s;s, and beg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> to think &s;eriou&s;ly of marrying; he prayed to God to direct him in &s;o important a bu&s;ine&s;s. He knew that a taw|dry, vain, dre&s;&s;y girl, was not likely to make good chee&s;e and butter, and that a worldly and ungodly woman would make a &s;ad wife and mi&s;tre&s;s of a family. He &s;oon heard of a young woman of excellent character, who had been bred up by the vicar's lady, and &s;till lived in the family as upper maid. She was prudent, &s;ober, in|du&s;trious, and religious. Her neat, mode&s;t, and plain appearance at church, (for &s;he was &s;eldom &s;een any where el&s;e out of her ma&s;ter's family) was an example to all per&s;ons in her &s;tation, and never f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lled to recommend her to &s;trangers, even before they had an opportunity of knowing the goodne&s;s of her character.

<P>This worthy gentleman, though &s;orry to lo&s;e &s;o va|luable a member of his little family, did not &s;cruple a moment about parting with her, when he found it would be &s;o greatly to her advantage.

<P>"Sir," &s;aid Farmer White, "I humbly thank you for all your kind in&s;tructions, of which I &s;hall &s;tand more in need than ever, as I &s;hall have more duties to fulfil. I hope the remembrance of my pa&s;t offences will keep me humble, and the &s;en&s;e of my remaining &s;in will keep me watchful.

<HEAD>THE WAY TO PLENTY; OR THE SECOND PART OF <HI>TOM WHITE.</HI></HEAD>
<P>TOM WHITE, as we have &s;hewn in the fir&s;t pass of this hi&s;tory, from an idle po&s;t-boy was become a re&s;pectable farmer. God had ble&s;&s;ed has indu&s;try, and he had pro&s;pered in the world, He was &s;ober and tem|perate, and, as was the natural con&s;equence, he was ac|tive and healthy. He was indu&s;trious and frugal, and he became pro&s;perous in his circum&s;tances. This is in the ordinary cour&s;e of providence. But it is not a certain and nece&s;&s;ary rule. <HI>God maketh his &s;un to &s;hine on the ju&s;t and the unju&s;t.</HI> A man who u&s;es every hone&s;t means of thrift and indu&s;try, will, in mo&s;t ca&s;es, find &s;ucce&s;s attend his labors. But &s;till the <HI>race is not always to the &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ift, nor the battle to the &s;trong.</HI> God is &s;ometimes plea&s;ed, for wi&s;e ends, to di&s;appoint all the worldly hope, of the mo&s;t upright man. His corn may be &s;mitten by a blight. His barns may be con&s;umed by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e. His cat|tle may be carried off by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">per. And to the&s;e and other mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ortun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">, he is as liable as the &s;pend thrift or the knave, Succe&s;s is the <HI>common</HI> reward <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> indu&s;try, but if it were its <HI>con&s;tant</HI> reward, the in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">rious would be tempted to look no further than the pre&s;ent &s;tate. They
<PB N="47" REF="035296_0046_1001C05A5CD09258">would lo&s;e one &s;trong ground of their faith. It would &s;et a&s;ide the &s;cripture &s;cheme. This world would be looked on as a &s;tate of reward, in&s;tead of a &s;tate of trial, and we &s;hould forget to look to a day of final retribu|tion.</P>
<P>Farmer White never took it into his head, that be|cau&s;e he paid his debts, worked early and late, and ate the bread of carefulne&s;s, he was therefore to come into no <HI>misfortune like other folk,</HI> but was to be free <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">om the common trials and troubles of life. He knew that pro&s;perity was far from being a &s;ure mark of God's fa|vor, and had read in good books, and e&s;pecially in the Bible, of the great poverty and afflictions of the be&s;t of men. Though he was no great &s;cholar, he had &s;en&s;e e|nough to ob&s;erve, that a time of public pro&s;perity was not always a time of public virtue; and he thought that what was true of a whole nation might be true of one man. So the more he pro&s;pered the more he prayed that pro&s;perity might not corrupt his heart. And when he &s;aw lately &s;igns of public di&s;tre&s;s coming on, he was not half &s;o much frightened as &s;ome others were, becau&s;e he thought it might do us good in the long run; and he was in hopes that a little poverty might bring on a lit|tle penitence. The great grace he labored after was that of a cheerful &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. He u&s;ed to &s;ay, that if the Lord's Prayer had only contained tho&s;e four little words THY WILL BE DONE, it would be worth more than the bigge&s;t book in the world without them.</P>
<P>Dr. Shepherd, the worthy vicar, (with whom the far|mer's wife had formerly lived as hou&s;ekeeper) was very fond of taking a walk with him about his grounds, and u&s;ed to &s;ay, that he learnt as much from the farmer as the farmer did from him. If the doctor happened to ob|&s;erve, I am afraid the&s;e long rains will &s;poil this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ne piece of outs, the farmer would an&s;wer, "but then, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 words"> how good it is for the gra&s;s." If the doctor &s;eat|ed
<PB N="48" REF="035296_0047_1001C05E66724900">&s;ure the rye would turn out well. When gra&s;s failed, he did not doubt but turnips would be plenty. Even for floods and inundations he would find out &s;ome way to ju&s;tify Providence. "'Tis better," &s;aid he "to have our lands a little overflowed, than that the &s;prings &s;hould be dried up, and our cattle faint for lack of wa|ter." When the drought came, he thanked God that the &s;ea&s;on would be healthy; and high winds, which frightened others, he &s;aid &s;erved to clear the air. Who|ever or whatever was wrong, he was always &s;u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> that Providence was in the right. And he u&s;ed to &s;ay, that a man with ever &s;o &s;mall an income, if he had but fru|gality and temperance, and ca&s;t off all vain de&s;ires, was richer than a lord who was tormented by vanity and covetou&s;ne&s;s. When he &s;aw others in the wrong, he did not however abu&s;e them for it, but took care to a|void the &s;ame fault. He had &s;en&s;e and &s;pirit enough to break through many old but very bad cu&s;toms of his neighbors. "If a thing is wrong in it&s;elf," (&s;aid he one day to Farmer Hodges) "a whole pari&s;h doing it can't make it right. And as to it's being an old cus|tom, why if it be a good one I like it the better for be|ing old, becau&s;e it has the &s;tamp of ages and the &s;anc|tion of experience on its worth. But if it be old as well as bad, that is another rea&s;on for my trying to put an end to it, that we may not mi&s;lead our children as our fathers have mi&s;led us."</P>

<HEAD>THE ROOF-RAISING.</HEAD>
<P>Some years after he was &s;ettled, he built a large new barn. All the workmen were looking forward to the u&s;ual holiday of roof-rai&s;ing. On this occa&s;ion it was a cu&s;tom to give a dinner to the workmen, with &s;o much liquor after it that they got &s;o drunk that they not only lo&s;t the remaining half day's work, but they were not always able to work the next day.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="035296_0048_1001A34291EF7DE0">
Mrs. White provided a plentiful dinner for roof-rai&s;ing, and gave each man his mug of beer. After a hearty meal they began to grow clamorous for more drink. The farmer &s;aid, "My lads, I don't grudge you a few gallons of ale merely for the &s;ake of &s;aving my liquor, though that is &s;ome con&s;ideration; but I ne|ver will, knowingly, help any man to make a bea&s;t of him&s;elf. I am re&s;olved to break through a bad cu&s;tom. You are now well refre&s;hed. If you will go cheerfully to your work, you will have half a day's pay to take on Saturday night more than you would if this afternoon were wa&s;ted in drunkenne&s;s. For this your families will be the better: whereas, were I to give you more liquor when you have already had enough, I &s;hould help to rob them of their bread. But I wi&s;h to &s;hew you, that I have your good at heart full as much as my own profit. If you will now go to work, I will give you all another mug at night, when you leave off.&mdash;Thus your time will be &s;aved, your families helped, and my ale will not go to make rea&s;onable creatures wor&s;e than brute bea&s;ts."</P>
<P>Here he &s;topped.&mdash;"You are in the right on't, mas|ter," &s;aid Tom the thatcher. "You are a hearty man, farmer," &s;aid John Plane the carpenter." "Come a|long, boys," &s;aid Tim Brick the ma&s;on; &s;o they all went merrily to work, fortified with a good dinner.&mdash; There was only one drunken &s;urly fellow who refu&s;ed, that was Dick Guzzle, the &s;mith. Dick never works above two or three days in the week, and &s;pends the others at the Red Lion. He &s;wore, that if the farmer did not let him have as much liquor as he liked at roof-rai&s;ing, he would not &s;trike another &s;troke, but would leave the job unfini&s;hed, and he might get hands where he could. Farmer White took him at his word, and paid him off directly: glad enough to get rid of &s;uch a &s;ot, whom he had only employed from pity to a large and almo&s;t &s;tarving family. When the men came for
<PB N="50" REF="035296_0049_1001C06B9D6880E0">their mug in the evening, the farmer brought out the remains of the cold gammon: they made a hearty &s;up|per, and thanked him for having broke through a fool|i&s;h cu&s;tom, which was afterwards much left off in that pari&s;h, though Dick would not come into it, and lo&s;t mo&s;t of his work.</P>
<P>Farmer White's laborers were often complaining, that things were &s;o dear that they could not buy a bit of meat. He knew it was partly true, but not entirely, for it was before the&s;e very hard times. One morn|ing he &s;tept out to &s;ee how an outhou&s;e which he was thatching went on. He was &s;urprized to find the work at a &s;tand. He walked over to the thatcher's hou&s;e. "Tom," &s;aid he, "I de&s;ire that piece of work may be fini&s;hed directly. If a &s;hower comes my grain will be &s;poiled." "Indeed, ma&s;ter, I &s;han't work to|day, nor to-morrow, neither," &s;aid Tom. "You for|get that 'tis Ea&s;ter Monday, and to-morrow is Ea&s;ter Tue&s;day. And &s;o on Wedne&s;day I &s;hall thatch away ma&s;ter. But 'tis hard if a poor man who works all the year, may not enjoy the&s;e few holidays."</P>
<P>"Tom," &s;aid the farmer, "when the&s;e days were fir&s;t put into our prayer-book, the good men who did it, little thought that the time would come when <HI>holy-day</HI> &s;hould mean <HI>drunken-day.</HI> How much do&s;t think now I &s;hall pay thee for this piece of thatch?" "Why you know ma&s;ter you have let it to me by the great. I think between this and to-morrow night, as the wea|ther is &s;o fine, I could clear about four &s;hillings, after I had paid my boy. But thatching does not come often, and other work is not &s;o profitable." "Very well, Tom; and how much now do you think you may &s;pend in the&s;e two holidays?" "Why ma&s;ter, if the ale is plea&s;ant, and the company merry, I do not expect to get off for le&s;s than three &s;hillings." "Tom, can you do pounds, &s;hillings, and pence?" "I can make a little &s;core, ma&s;ter, behind the kitchen door with a bit of chalk, which is as much as I want." "Well, Tom,
<PB N="51" REF="035296_0050_1001C0700690C940">add the four &s;hillings you would have earned, to the three you intend to &s;pend, what does that make?" "Let me &s;ee! three and four make &s;even. Seven &s;hillings, ma&s;ter." "Tom, you often tell me the times are &s;o bad that you can never buy a bit of meat. Now here is the co&s;t of two joints at once; to &s;ay nothing of the &s;in of wa&s;ting time and getting drunk." "I never once thought of that," &s;aid Tom. "Now Tom," &s;aid the farmer, "if I were you, I would &s;tep over to Butcher Jobbin's, buy a &s;houlder of mutton, which being left from Saturday's market you will get a little cheaper.&mdash; This I would make my wife bake in a deep di&s;h full of potatoes. I would then go to work, and when the din|ner was ready I would go and enjoy it with my wife and children; you need not give the mutton to the chil|dren&mdash;the potatoes will have all the gravy, and be ve|ry &s;avory for them." "Aye, but I've got no beer mas|ter, the times are &s;o hard that a poor man can't afford to brew a drop of drink now as we u&s;ed to do."</P>
<P>"Times are bad, and malt is very dear, Tom, and yet both don't prevent your throwing away &s;even &s;hil|lings in keeping holiday. Now &s;end for a quart of ale, as it is to be a fea&s;t; and you will even then be four &s;hllings richer than if you had gone to the public hou&s;e. I would put by the&s;e four &s;hillings, till I could add a couple to them; with this I would get a bu&s;nel of malt, and my wife &s;hould brew it, and you may take a pint at home of a night, which will do you more good than a gallon at the Red Lion." "I have a great mind to take your advice, ma&s;ter, but I &s;hall be made &s;uch fun of at the Lion; they will &s;o laugh at me if I dont go." "Let tho&s;e laugh that win, Tom." "But, ma&s;ter, I have got a friend to meet me there."&mdash;"Then a&s;k your friend to come and eat a bit of your cold mutton at night, and here is &s;ixpence for another pot, if you will pro|mi&s;e to brew a &s;mall ca&s;k of your own." "Thank you, ma&s;ter, and &s;o I will; and I won't <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o to the Lion.&mdash;
<PB N="52" REF="035296_0051_1001C07832FF3CA0">Come boy, bring the helm, and fetch the ladder." And &s;o Tom was upon the roof in a twinkling.</P>

<HEAD>THE SHEEP-SHEARING.</HEAD>
<P>Dr. Shepherd happened to &s;ay to Farmer White one day, "that there was nothing he di&s;liked more than the manner in which &s;heep-&s;hearing and harve&s;t-home were kept by &s;ome in his pari&s;h. What, &s;aid the good doc|tor, ju&s;t when we are ble&s;t with the&s;e natural riches of our land, the fleece of our flocks; when our barns are crowned with plenty, and we have reaped the fruits or the earth in due &s;ea&s;on; is that very time to be &s;et a|part for ribaldry, and riot, and drunkenne&s;s? Do we thank God for his mercies by making our&s;elves unwor|thy and unfit to enjoy them?"</P>
<P>"I thank you for the hint, &s;ir," &s;aid the farmer, "I am re&s;olved to rejoice, though, and others &s;hall rejoice with me, and we will have a merry night on't."</P>
<P>So Mrs. White dre&s;&s;ed a very plentiful &s;upper of meat and pudding; and &s;pread out two tables. The farmer &s;at at the head of one, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e of the neighbors, and all his work-people. At the other &s;at his wife, with two long benches on each &s;ide of her.&mdash; at the&s;e &s;at all the old and infirm poor, e&s;pecially tho&s;e who lived in the work-hou&s;e, and had no day of fe&s;tivi|ty to look forward to in the whole year but this. On the gra&s;s, in the little court, &s;at the children of his la|borers, and of the other poor, who&s;e employment it had been to gather flowers, and dre&s;s and adorn the horns of the ram; for the farmer did not wi&s;h to put an end to any old cu&s;tom, if it was innocent. His own chil|dren &s;tood by the table, and he gave them plenty of pudding, which they carried to the children of the poor, with a little draught of cider to every one.</P>
<P>This fea&s;t, though orderly and decent, was yet hearty and cheerful. Dr. Shepherd dropped in with a good deal of company he had at his hou&s;e, and they were
<PB N="53" REF="035296_0052_1001C07AA58DD0B8">much plea&s;ed. When the doctor &s;aw how the aged and the infirm poor were enjoying them&s;elves, he was much moved; he &s;hook the farmer by the hand, and &s;aid, "But thou, when thou make&s;t a fea&s;t, call the blind, and the lame, and the halt; they cannot recom|pen&s;e thee, but thou &s;halt be recompen&s;ed at the re&s;ur|rection of the ju&s;t."</P>
<P>"Sir," &s;aid the farmer, "'tis no great matter of ex|pen&s;e&mdash;I kill a &s;heep of my own; potatoes are as plen|ty as blackberries, with people who have a little fore|thought. I &s;ave much more cider in the cour&s;e of a year, by never allowing any carou&s;ing in my kitchen or drunkenne&s;s in my fields, than would &s;upply many &s;uch fea&s;ts as the&s;e, &s;o that I &s;hall be never the poorer at Chri&s;tmas. It is cheaper to make people happy, &s;ir, than to make them drunk. The doctor and the ladies conde&s;cended to walk from one table to the other, and heard many merry &s;tories, but not one profane word, or one indecent &s;ong: &s;o that he was not-forced to the painful nece&s;&s;ity either of reproving them, or leaving them in anger. When all was over they &s;ung the &s;ix|ty-fifth p&s;alm, and the ladies all joined in it; and when they got home to the vicarage to tea, they declared they liked it better than any concert.</P>

<HEAD>THE HARD WINTER.</HEAD>
<P>In the famous cold winter of the pre&s;ent year, 1795, it was edifying to &s;ee how patiently Farmer White bore that long and &s;evere fro&s;t. Many of his &s;heep were frozen to death, but he thanked God that he had &s;till many left. He continued to find in-door work, that his men might not be out of employ. Mrs. White was &s;o con&s;iderate, that ju&s;t at that time &s;he le&s;&s;ened the number of her hogs, that &s;he might have mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e whey and &s;kim-milk to a&s;&s;i&s;t poor familes.&mdash;Nay, I have known her live on boiled meat for a long time toge|ther, in a &s;ickly &s;ea&s;on, becau&s;e the pot-liquor made
<PB N="54" REF="035296_0053_1001C082EAF49CD0">&s;uch a &s;upply of broth for the &s;ick poor. As the &s;pring came on, and things grew wor&s;e, &s;he never had a cake, a pye, or a pudding in her hou&s;e; though &s;he u&s;ed to have plenty of the&s;e good things, and will again, I hope, when the pre&s;ent &s;carcity is over; though the &s;ays &s;he never will u&s;e &s;uch white flour again, even if it &s;hould come down to five &s;hillings a bu&s;hel.</P>
<P>All the pari&s;h now began to murmur. Farmer Jones was &s;ure the fro&s;t had killed the wheat. Farmer Wil|&s;on &s;aid the rye would never come up. Brown, the malt&s;ter, in&s;i&s;ted the barley was dead at the root. But|cher Jobbins &s;aid beef would be a &s;hilling a pound. All declared there would not be a hop to brew with. The orchards were all blighted, there would not be apples enough to make a pye: and as to hay, there would be none to be had for love nor money.&mdash;"I'll tell you what," &s;aid Farmer White, "the &s;ea&s;on is dreadful.&mdash;The crops are unpromi&s;ing ju&s;t now; but 'tis too early to judge. Don't let us make things wor&s;e than they are. We ought to comfort the poor, and you are dri|ving them to de&s;pair. Don't you know how much God was di&s;plea&s;ed with the murmurs of his cho&s;en people? And yet, when they were tired of manna he &s;ent them quails; but all did not do. Nothing &s;atisfies grum|blers. We have a promi&s;e on our &s;ide, that there &s;hall be &s;eed time and harve&s;t time to the end. Let us then hope for a good day, but provide again&s;t an evil one. Let us rather prevent the evil before it comes upon us, than &s;ink under it when it comes. Grumbling cant help us. Activity can. Let us &s;et about planting potatoes in e|very nook and corner, in ca&s;e the corn <HI>&s;hould</HI> fail, which, however, I don't believe. Let us mend our manage|ment before we are driven to it by actual want. And if we allow our hone&s;t laborers to plant a few potatoes for their families in the head-lands of our ploughed fields, or other wa&s;te bits of ground, it will do us no harm, and be a great help to them."</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="035296_0054_1001C087B7C6EE40">
The farmer had many temptations to &s;end his corn at an extravagant price to a <HI>certain &s;ea-port town;</HI> but as he knew that it was intended to export it again&s;t law, he would not be tempted to encourage unlawful gain; &s;o he thre&s;hed out a &s;mall mow at a time, and &s;old it to the neighboring poor far below the market price. He &s;erved his own workmen fir&s;t. This was the &s;ame to them as if he had rai&s;ed their wages, and even better, as it was a benefit of which their families were &s;ure to partake. If the poor in the next pari&s;h were more di&s;tre&s;&s;ed than his own, he &s;old to them at the &s;ame rate. "For," &s;aid he, "there is no di&s;tinction of pari&s;hes in heaven; and though charity begins at home, yet it ought not to end there."</P>
<P>He had been u&s;ed in good times now and then to catch a hare or a partridge, as he was qualified. But he now re&s;olved to give up that plea&s;ure. So he parted from a couple of &s;paniels he had; for he &s;aid he could not bear that his dogs &s;hould be eating the meat or the milk, which &s;o many men, women, and children wanted.</P>

<P>One day, it was about the middle of la&s;t July, when things &s;eemed to be at the deare&s;t, and the rulers of the land had agreed to &s;et the example of eating nothing but coar&s;e bread.

Mrs. White, of cour&s;e, was at church, and com|mended it mightily. Next morning the doctor took a walk over to the farmer's, in order to &s;ettle further plans for the relief of the pari&s;h. He was much &s;urpri&s;ed to meet Mrs. White's little maid Sally with a very &s;mall wheat loaf, which &s;he had been buying at a &s;hop. He &s;aid nothing to the girl, as he never thought it right to expo&s;e the faults of a mi&s;tre&s;s to her &s;ervant, but walked on, re&s;olving to give Mrs. White a &s;evere lecture for
<PB N="56" REF="035296_0055_1001C093343FCF08">the fir&s;t time in his life. He &s;oon changed his mind, for on going into the kitchen the fir&s;t per&s;on he &s;aw was Tom the thatcher, who had had a &s;ad fall from a ladder; his arm, which was &s;lipped out of his &s;leeve, was &s;well|ed in a frightful manner. Mrs. White was &s;tanding at the dre&s;&s;er making the little wheat loaf into a poultice, which &s;he laid upon the &s;welling in a large clean old cloth.</P>
<P>"I a&s;k your pardon, my good Sarah," &s;aid the doc|tor, "I ought not, however appearances were again&s;t you, to have &s;u&s;pected that &s;o humble and prudent a woman as you are, would be led either to indulge any daintine&s;s of your own, or to fly in the face of your bet|ters, by eating white bread while they are eating brown. Whenever I come here I &s;ee it is not needful to be rich in order to be charitable. A bountiful rich man would have &s;ent Tom to a &s;urgeon, who would have done no more for him than you have done; for in tho&s;e inflam|mations the mo&s;t &s;kilful &s;urgeon could only apply a poultice. Your kindne&s;s in dre&s;&s;ing the wound your|&s;elf will, I doubt not, perform the cure at the expen&s;e of that threepenny loaf and a little hog's lard. And I will take care that Tom &s;hall have a good &s;upply of rice from the &s;ub&s;cription." "And he &s;han't want for &s;kim milk," &s;aid Mrs. White; and was he the be&s;t lord in the land, in the &s;tate he is in, a di&s;h of good nice milk would be better for him than the nice&s;t meat.</P>

<HEAD>THE PARISH MEETING.</HEAD>
<P>On the tenth of Augu&s;t the ve&s;try held another meet|ing, to con&s;ult on the be&s;t method of further a&s;&s;i&s;ting the poor. The abundant crops now cheered every heart. Farmer white had a mind to be a little jocular with his de&s;ponding neighbors. "Well, neighbor Jones," &s;aid he, "all the wheat was killed, I &s;uppo&s;e. The barley all dead at the root." Farmer Jones looked &s;heepi&s;h, and &s;aid, "to be &s;ure the crops had turned out better
<PB N="57" REF="035296_0056_1001A3519F1E4730">than he thought." "Then," &s;aid Dr. Shepherd, "let us learn to tru&s;t Providence another time."</P>
<P>Among other things, they agreed to &s;ub&s;cribe for a large quantity of rice, which was to be &s;old out to the poor at a very low price, and Mrs. White was &s;o kind as to undertake the trouble of &s;elling it. After this day's work was over, all who wi&s;hed to buy at the&s;e reduced rates were ordered to come to the farm on the Tue&s;day evening. Dr. Shepherd dropped in at the &s;ame time, and when Mrs. White had done weighing her rice, the doc|tor &s;poke as follows:</P>
<P>"My hone&s;t friends, it has plea&s;ed God to vi&s;it this land with a &s;carcity, to which we have been little ac|cu&s;tomed. There are &s;ome idle evil-minded people who are on the watch for public di&s;tre&s;&s;es, not that they may humble them&s;elves under the mighty hand of God, (which is the true u&s;e to be made of all troubles) but that they may benefit them&s;elves by di&s;turbing the pub|lic peace. The&s;e people, by riot and drunkenne&s;s, dou|ble the evil which they pretend to cure. Riot will com|plete our misfortunes, while peace, indu&s;try, and good management, will go near to cure them. Bread, to be &s;ure, is uncommonly dear. Among the various ways of making it cheaper, one is to reduce the quality of it, a|nother, to le&s;&s;en the quantity we con&s;ume. If we can|not get enough of coar&s;e wheaten bread, let us make it of other grain. Or let us mix one half of potatoes, and one half of wheat. This la&s;t is what I eat in my own family. It is plea&s;ant and whole&s;ome. Our ble&s;&s;ed Sa|viour ate barley bread you know, as we were told in the la&s;t month's Sunday Reading of the Cheap Repo&s;itory, which I hope you have all heard, as I de&s;ired the mat|ter of the Sunday &s;chool to read it ju&s;t after evening &s;ervice, when I know many of the parents are apt to call in at the &s;chool. This is a good cu&s;tom, and one of tho&s;e little books &s;hall be often read at that time.</P>
<P>"My good women, I truly feel for you at this time
<PB N="58" REF="035296_0057_1001C09CF5A229E0">of &s;carcity; and I am going to &s;hew my good will, as much by my advice as my &s;ub&s;cription. It is my duty, as your friend and mini&s;ter, to tell you, that one half of your pre&s;ent hard&s;hips is owing to BAD MANAGEMENT. I often meet your children without &s;hoes and &s;tockings, with great luncheons of the very white&s;t bread, and that three times a day. Half that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">antity, and &s;till le&s;s-if it were coar&s;e, put into a di&s;h of good onion or leek por|ridge, would make them an excellent breakfa&s;t. Many too of the very poore&s;t of you eat your bread hot from the oven; this makes the difference of one loaf in five; I a&s;&s;ure you it is what I cannot afford to do. Come, Mrs. White, you mu&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;t me a little. I am not very know|ing in the&s;e matters my&s;elf; but I know that the rich would be twice as charitable if the poor made a better u&s;e of their bounty. Mrs. White do give the&s;e poor women a little advice how to make their pittance go farther than it now does. When you lived with me you were famous for making us nice, cheap di&s;hes, and I dare &s;ay you are not le&s;s notable now you manage for your&s;elf."</P>
<P>"Indeed, neighbors," &s;aid Mrs. White, "what the good doctor &s;ays is very true. A halfpenny worth of oatmeal or groats, with a leek or onion, out of your own garden, which co&s;ts nothing, a bit or &s;alt, and a little coar&s;e bread, will breakfa&s;t your whole family. It is a great mi&s;take at any time to think a bit of meat is &s;o ruinous, and a great load of bread &s;o cheap. A poor man gets &s;even or eight &s;hillings a week; if he is care|ful he brings it home. I dare not &s;ay how much of this goes for tea in the afternoon, now &s;ugar and butter are &s;o dear, becau&s;e I &s;hould have you all upon me, but I will &s;ay that too much of this little goes even for bread, from a notion that it is the harde&s;t fare. This, at all times, but particularly now, is bad management. Dry pea&s;e, to be &s;ure, have been very dear lately! but now they are plenty enough. I am certain then, that if a &s;hil|ling
<PB N="59" REF="035296_0058_1001A359169C6BF0">or two of the &s;even or eight was laid out for a bit of coar&s;e beef, a &s;heep's head, or any &s;uch thing, it would be well be&s;towed. I would throw a couple of pound of this into the pot, with two or three handfuls of grey pea&s;e, an onion, and a little pepper. Then I would throw in cabbage, or turnip, and carrot, or any garden &s;tuff that was mo&s;t plenty; let it &s;tew two or three hours, and it will make a di&s;h fit for his maje&s;ty. The work|ing man &s;hould have the meat, the children don't want it, the &s;oup will be thick and &s;ub&s;tantial, and requires no bread.</P>

<HEAD>RICE MILK.</HEAD>
<P>"You who can get &s;kim milk, as all our workmen can, have a great advantage. A quart of this, and a quarter of a pound of the rice you have ju&s;t bought, a little bit of all-&s;pice, and brown &s;ugar, will make a dain|ty and cheap di&s;h."</P>
<P>"Ble&s;s your heart!" muttered Amy Grumble, who looked as dirty as a cinder-wench, with her face and fingers all daubed with &s;nuff; "rice milk indeed; it is very nice, to be &s;ure, for tho&s;e who can dre&s;s it, but we have not a bit of coal; rice is of no u&s;e to us without firing." "And yet," &s;aid the doctor, "I &s;ee your tea-kettle boiling twice every day, as I pa&s;s by the poor-hou&s;e, and fre&s;h butter at eleven pence a pound on your &s;helf." "O dear, &s;ir," cried Amy, "a few &s;ticks &s;erve to boil the tea-kettle." "And a few more," &s;aid the doctor, "will boil the rice milk, and give twice the nouri&s;hment at a quarter of the expen&s;e."</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>RICE PUDDING.</HEAD>
<P>"Pray Sarah," &s;aid the doctor, "how did you u&s;e to make that pudding my children were &s;o fond of? And I remember, when it was cold, we u&s;ed to have it in the parlour for &s;upper." "Nothing more ea&s;y," &s;aid Mrs. White. "I put half a pound of rice, two quarts of &s;kim
<PB N="60" REF="035296_0059_1001C0A98E575360">milk, and two ounces of brown &s;ugar." "Well," &s;aid the doctor, "and how many will this dine?" "S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ven or eight, &s;ir." "Very well, and what will it co&s;t?" "Why, &s;ir, it did not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o&s;t you &s;o much, becau&s;e we baked it at home, and I u&s;ed our own milk; it will not co&s;t above &s;even pence to tho&s;e who pay for both. Here too bread is &s;aved."</P>
<P>"Pray, Sarah, let me put in a word," &s;aid Farmer White. "I advi&s;e my men to rai&s;e each a large bed of par&s;nips. They are very nouri&s;hing, and very profit|able. Six penny worth of &s;eed, well &s;owed, and trod in, will produce more meals than &s;our &s;acks of potatoes; and what is material to you who have &s;o little ground, it will not require more than an eight part of the ground which the four &s;acks will take. Par&s;nips are very good the &s;econd day warmed in the frying-pan, and a little ra&s;her of pork or bacon will give them a nice flavour."</P>
<P>Dr. Shepherd now &s;aid, "as a proof of the nouri&s;h|ing quality of par&s;nips, I was reading in a hi&s;tory book this very day, that the American Indians make a great part of their bread of par&s;nips, though Indian corn is &s;o famous; it will make a little variety too."</P>
<P>"I remember," &s;ays Mrs. White, "a cheap di&s;h, &s;o nice that it makes my mouth water. I peel &s;ome raw potatoes, &s;lice them thin, put the &s;lices into a deep fry|ing-pan, or pot, with a little water, an onion, and a bit of pepper. Then I get a bone or two of a brea&s;t of mut|ton, or a little &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ip of &s;alt pork, and put into it. Cover it down clo&s;e, keep in the &s;team, and let it &s;tew for an hour."</P>
<P>"You really get me an appetite, Mrs. White, by your dainty receipts," &s;aid the doctor. "I am re&s;olved to have this di&s;h at my own <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">." "I could tell you another very good di&s;h, and &s;till cheaper," an&s;wered &s;he. "Come, let us have it," <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ed the doctor. "I &s;hall write <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> down as &s;oon as I get <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, and I will favor any body with a copy of the&s;e re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ipts who w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">all at

<P>"Take two or three pickled herrings, put them into a &s;tone jar, fill it up with potatoes, and a little water, and let it bake in the oven till it is done. I would give one hint more," added &s;he; "I have taken to u&s;e no|thing but potatoe &s;tarch; and though I &s;ay it, that &s;hould not &s;ay it, nobody's linen in a common way looks better than ours."</P>
<P>The Doctor now &s;aid, "I am &s;orry for one hard&s;hip which many poor-people labor under, I mean the diffi|culty of getting a little milk. I wi&s;h all farmer's wives were as con&s;iderate as you are, Mrs. White. A little milk is a great comfort to the poor, e&s;pecially when their children are &s;ick. And I have known it an&s;wer to the &s;eller as well as to the buyer, to keep a cow or two on purpo&s;e to &s;ell it out by the quart."</P>
<P>"Sir," &s;aid Farmer White, "I beg leave to &s;ay a word to the men, if you plea&s;e, for all your advice goes to the women. If you will drink le&s;s gin you may get more meat. If you ab&s;tain from the alehou&s;e you may, many of you, get a little one-way beer at home." "Aye, that we can, Farmer," &s;ays poor Tom the thatcher, who was now got well. "Ea&s;ter Monday for that&mdash;I &s;ay no more.&mdash;A word to the wi&s;e." The farmer &s;miled and went on. "The number of public hou&s;es in many a pari&s;h brings on more hunger and rags than all the tax|es in it, heavy as they are. All the other evils put to|gether hardly make up the &s;um of that one. We are now rai&s;ing a fre&s;h &s;ub&s;cription for you. This will be our rule of giving. We will not give to &s;ots, gamblers, and &s;abbath-breakers. Tho&s;e who do not &s;et their young children to work on week days, and &s;end them to &s;chool on Sundays, de&s;erve little favor. No man &s;hould keep a dog till he has more food than his family wants. If
<PB N="62" REF="035296_0061_1001C0B2B1C539E8">he feeds them at home they rob his children; if he &s;tarves them, they rob his neighbors. We have heard in a neighboring city that &s;ome people carried back the &s;ub&s;cription loaves becau&s;e they were too coar&s;e; but we hope better things of you." Here Betty Plane beg|ged, with all humility, to put in a word. "Certainly," &s;aid the doctor, "we will li&s;ten to all mode&s;t complaints, and try to redre&s;s them." "You were plea&s;ed to &s;ay, &s;ir," &s;aid &s;he, "that we might find much comfort from buying coar&s;e bits of beef. And &s;o we might, but you do not know, &s;ir, that we can &s;eldom get them, even when we had the money, and times were not &s;o bad." "How &s;o, Betty?" "Sir, when we go to butcher Job|bins for a bit of &s;hin, or any other lean piece, his an&s;wer is, 'you can't have it to-day. The cook at the great hou&s;e has be&s;poke it for gravy, or the doctor's maid (begging your pardon, &s;ir,) has ju&s;t ordered it for &s;oup.' Now, &s;ir, if &s;uch kind gentlefolks were aware that this gravy and &s;oup not only con&s;ume a great deal of meat, (which, to be &s;ure, tho&s;e have a right to u&s;e who can pay for it) but that it takes away tho&s;e coar&s;e pieces which the poor would buy, if they bought at all, I am &s;ure they would not do it. For indeed the rich have been very kind, and I don't know what we &s;hould have done without them."</P>
<P>"I thank you for the hint, Betty," &s;aid the doc|tor, "and I a&s;&s;ure you I will have no more gravy &s;oup.&mdash;My garden will &s;upply me with &s;oups, that are both whole&s;omer and better: and I will an&s;wer for my lady at the great hou&s;e that &s;he will do the &s;ame.

Tho&s;e who have been &s;een aiding or abetting any RIOT, any attack on butchers, bakers, wheat mows, mills, or millers, we will not relieve. With the quiet contented, hard-work|ing man I will &s;hare my la&s;t mor&s;el of bread. I &s;hall only add, that though it has plea&s;ed God to &s;end us this vi&s;itation as a puni&s;hment, yet we may convert this &s;hort trial into a la&s;ting ble&s;&s;ing, if we all turn over a new leaf. Pro&s;perity had made mo&s;t of us carele&s;s. The thoughtle&s;s profu&s;ion of &s;ome of the rich, could only be exceeded by the idlene&s;s and bad management of &s;ome of the poor. Let us now at la&s;t adopt that good old maxim, EVERY ONE MEND ONE. And may God add his ble&s;&s;ing!"</P>
<P>The people now cheerfully departed with their rice, re&s;olving, as many of them as could get milk, to put one of Mrs. White's receipts in practice that very night; and a rare &s;upper they had.</P>
<P>I hope &s;oon to give a good account how this pari&s;h improved in ea&s;e and comfort, by their improvement in frugality and good management.</P>

<HEAD>THE LIFE OF <HI>WILLIAM BAKER.</HI> BY THE REV. MR. GILPIN.</HEAD>
<P>WILLIAM BAKER was born in the year 1710, in the pari&s;h of Boldre, near Lymington, in Hamp&s;hire. His father dying when he was two years old, left him and a &s;i&s;ter to the care of his widow; who by taking in wa&s;hing, maintained her two children with|out any relief from the pari&s;h.&mdash;In the&s;e days &s;uch in|du&s;try would exceed belief.</P>
<P>At &s;even years of age young Baker began that life of labor, which he continued through the &s;pace of &s;eventy years afterwards. He worked fir&s;t for a penny a day in the vicarage garden; but &s;oon thought him&s;elf equal to more profitable labor. He u&s;ed to &s;ay he always con&s;i|dered him&s;elf as a poor friendle&s;s lad; and from the be|ginning depended only on him&s;elf.</P>
<P>In the mean time his mother grew old and infirm.&mdash;Her legs &s;welled, and &s;he could no longer &s;tand at her wa&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> tub. But nothing hurt her like the thoughts of going to the poor-hou&s;e, or living on alms.</P>
<P>Her &s;on was now about eighteen. He was healthy and &s;trong; and a&s;&s;ured his mother, that while he was able to work for her, &s;he &s;hould be obliged to nobody, He took a little cottage therefore on the edge of the for|e&s;t;
<PB N="65" REF="035296_0064_1001C0BD432004B0">carried her to it; and got into the &s;ervice of a far|mer in the neighborhood, as a day laborer. His mother lived nine years after this; during which time he main|tained her with great cheerfulne&s;s, and kindne&s;s: nor had &s;he ever a&s;&s;i&s;tance from any other per&s;on. He de|nied him&s;elf every little indulgence which young fellows of that age often take, that he might maintain his mo|ther.&mdash;We do not often &s;ee &s;uch an in&s;tance of goodne&s;s in a poor lad. It marked his character as &s;omething un|common. He might, if he had plea&s;ed, have had her maintained by the pari&s;h.</P>
<P>About the time of his mother's death he thought of marrying. At a little di&s;tance from him, under the hill, lived a laborer of the name of Brooks. His daughter Joanna was the per&s;on whom Baker fixed on for a wife; and no objection being made, he married her, and bro't her to his cottage. Joanna had lived under a careful mother, ju&s;t in the way in which he him&s;elf had always lived; and with the &s;ame notions of indu&s;try and fru|gality. She entered therefore into all her hu&s;band's in|tentions. What he gained, &s;he put to the be&s;t u&s;e.&mdash;"We both pulled the rope," he u&s;ed to &s;ay "by the &s;ame end; and &s;o we compa&s;&s;ed many things which they cannot do, who pull at different ends."</P>
<P>In the mean time, his family increa&s;ed; and his in|du&s;try increa&s;ed with it. He now never worked "by the day," if he could help it; but took the harde&s;t "ta&s;k|work" he could get, by which the mo&s;t money was to be earned. And that he might "never" be idle, he took, at a &s;mall rent, of Mrs. John Burrard, of Lyming|ton, a piece of rough ground, about nine or ten acres, on which he might employ his lei&s;ure. Many a time he was &s;een working in it before &s;un-ri&s;e; and if his day's work had not been hard, in an evening by moon-light. In a few years he made it worth much more, than when he took it; and he found it of great u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e to his family in furni&s;hing him &s;ometimes with a crop of potatoes&mdash;or a
<PB N="66" REF="035296_0065_1001C0C5B2556FE0">little corn&mdash;or a few loads of hay; which enabled <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> to keep two or three cows, and as many fore&s;t-colts.&mdash;Some years after, his good landlady died; and this piece of land fell into the hands of Mr. Brailsfield, of Kenti&s;h town; who finding it was tenanted by a man, who had taken &s;o much pains to improve it, promi&s;ed neither to rai&s;e his rent nor to take it from him; which I mention to his honor.&mdash;Thus a kind of providence ble&s;&s;ed all Baker's de&s;igns; and he was richer than many a man who is born to thou&s;ands. There are few men, who may not live comfortably, if they live "according to their &s;tation:" and if they "do not," the highe&s;t &s;tations will not &s;ecure from difficulties. I have often heard Ba|ket &s;ay, he never knew what want was: but then he never relaxed his u&s;ual frugality. When wheat was dear, to make all ends meet, he lived on barley; and when he could not with convenience compa&s;s a bu&s;hel of malt, he contented him&s;elf with milk, or water.</P>
<P>He had now &s;ive children, who were a con&s;tant claim upon all his indu&s;try and frugality. But he had other claims. He had been kind to his &s;i&s;ter, though her be|havior did not entirely plea&s;e him: and he was now call|ed on from a quarter, he did not expect. His wife's fa|ther, grown old, applied to him for a&s;&s;i&s;tance. Of this man he never had a high opinion; but for his mother-in-law he had always the greate&s;t e&s;teem. "She was as good a woman," he u&s;ed to &s;ay, "as his wife; and could not &s;ay more for any woman on earth." However, tho' he could not pretend, with the incumbrance of &s;o large a family, to maintain them entirely, he agreed with the over&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ers of the pari&s;h, that if they would pay them a &s;hilling a week, he would do the re&s;t.

About the time that his children were pretty well grown up, a fortunate circum&s;tance happened. He re|ceived a legacy of &s;eventy pounds, and a clock. This money came very happily to &s;ettle &s;ome of his children. "They had it all," he &s;aid, "among them: he never had a belly full of meat out of it him&s;elf." The clock alone he kept. A clock was the only piece of furniture he e|ver coveted; and he always intended, if it &s;hould be in his power, to have purcha&s;ed one; though, it is proba|ble, if a clock had not been thus thrown in his way, he would always have found &s;omething more u&s;eful for the employment of his money.</P>
<P>Nor was he kind only to his relations, as he got for|ward in the world, he was very friendly among his neigh|bors, and lent many a little &s;um to a&s;&s;i&s;t them in their di&s;tre&s;&s;es, But as he was a very &s;hrewd, intelligent man, he lent only where he &s;aw his money could be of u&s;e; to the &s;pendthrift he would lend nothing, nor to any man who frequented an alehou&s;e. So judicious was he in the&s;e loans, that although he helped many a man out of a difficulty, I have heard him &s;ay, he never lo&s;t a far|thing by lending money in his life. Often indeed he re|ceived the worth of what he had lent in a little corn, a pig, a calf, or &s;omething that was more convenient for the borrower to pay with than money.</P>
<P>He was now advancing into years, and his good Joan|na began to feel the effects of age more than he did.&mdash;Her ailment was a mere decay of nature; but &s;he was &s;o entirely weakened, that &s;he could do nothing for her|&s;elf. Her hu&s;band hired a woman into the hou&s;e to at|tend her near &s;even years, in which &s;he continued in this helple&s;s &s;tate, Every thing he could do, he did for a wo|man, "who," he &s;aid, "had been kinder to every bo|dy than her&s;elf. In the year 1776 &s;he died, and left him greatly afflicted for the lo&s;s or a faithful friend, who had followed clo&s;e by his &s;ide, through all his laborious life, for the &s;pace of forty years. I have &s;een him &s;peak of
<PB N="68" REF="035296_0067_1001C0CEC86B9420">her with tears in his eyes, and agitation in all he &s;aid, at the age of eighty.</P>
<P>He had now the world, in a manner, to begin again. His children were all married, or di&s;per&s;ed; and he had nobody with him, on who&s;e arm he could lean in des|cending the hill. He thought the wife&s;t thing he could do, was to draw his little matters into as &s;mall a com|pa&s;s as he could, and rid him&s;elf, as much as po&s;&s;ible, of the cares of the world. Accordingly he &s;old his cows, and hor&s;es, and a little tenement or two, which he had purcha&s;ed, and brought one hundred and ten pounds to a friend to put to &s;ome u&s;e. "For as I cannot now," &s;aid he, "work my&s;elf, I mu&s;t make my money," as he phra&s;ed it, "work for me." His friend made him un|der&s;tand, as well as he could, what was meant by the funds, and advi&s;ed him to put his money into con&s;oli|dated annuities for twenty-eight years from January, 1780. As this tran&s;action was in the year 1782, when the funds were low, he was made to under&s;tand, that the intere&s;t would be con&s;iderable, (about eight pounds a year) but that the whole would be lo&s;t if he &s;hould live twenty-&s;ix years. However, as he did not look for|ward to that time, he took his friend's advice. Be&s;ides this property, he had two or three other little &s;ums put out to intere&s;t in private hands; and a little tenement, which he re&s;erved for him&s;elf to live in; with two or three patches of ground, which lay near him, and &s;erv|ed to employ him.</P>
<P>He had a good opinion of the charitable &s;ocieties or clubs, as they are called, in the &s;everal pari&s;hes around him; but he thought them u&s;eful chiefly to tho&s;e, who could not depend upon them&s;elvs. If young fellows could depend on them&s;elves, and lay the &s;ame money by, without breaking into it, he thought it might gene|rally be more u&s;eful to them. Four pence a week would amount to near a pound in the year. At harve&s;t &s;ome little matter might be added to it. And if this practice
<PB N="69" REF="035296_0068_1001C0D400D804C8">were begun early in life, in a few years, it might amount to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">table &s;upport in &s;ickne&s;s, or old age. "But few young fellows," &s;aid he, "looked forward to tho&s;e times. Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y never thought of more than of living from hand to mouth."</P>
<P>His manner now of &s;pending his time, was &s;omewhat different from what it u&s;ed to be. He worked only a little, every morning, in his grounds, or in his garden, or in precuring fuel. The re&s;t of his time he &s;pent in reading and a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">votion. He had always been a &s;erious me, but a bu&s;y life had never allowed him much time for any thing but bu&s;ine&s;s. He had now gotten above the world&mdash;had his time much to him&s;elf&mdash;and &s;pent a great part of it in reading the Bible, which was the on|ly book he did read. He had the u&s;e of his eyes to the la&s;t, and generally, though by him&s;elf, read out, which he thought made the more impre&s;&s;ion on his memory. Oftener than once, as I have approached his lonely cot|tage, I have thought I heard voices, but when I enter|ed the old man was &s;itting alone, with his Bible before him. He had as &s;trong natural parts as I almo&s;t ever met with, and ea&s;ily under&s;tood, not only the general meaning and intention of the go&s;pel, but many of the mo&s;t difficult pa&s;&s;ages in it. What our Saviour &s;aid, he tho't, was very ea&s;y, and much of what St. Paul &s;aid. And he told me, he had a very good book of prayers, in his phra&s;e, "for all intents and purpo&s;es."</P>
<P>As he grew more and more infirm, his friends tho't it comfortle&s;s for him to live entirely by him&s;elf, and endeavored to per&s;uade him to get &s;ome good old wo|man to live with him, who might take care of his hou&s;e, and likewi&s;e of him, if any thing &s;hould ail him. "Aye," &s;aid he, "if I could get &s;ome good old woman&punc; but where is &s;he to be &s;ound?" He had tried the experi|ment, he &s;aid, but had no encouragement to try it again. People would not, he added, live now as he lived. Per|haps he had bad luck in his choice, but he found, that a
<PB N="70" REF="035296_0069_1001A3757763E6B0">woman now would &s;pend as much in junketting in one day, as would &s;erve him for two. Then, he &s;aid, there was &s;uch con&s;tant go&s;&s;ipping, and noi&s;e in his hou&s;e, that he could never have his time at his own di&s;po&s;al.&mdash;In &s;hort, he was obliged to live as they cho&s;e, not as he cho&s;e him&s;elf. Then fetching a deep &s;igh, he would &s;ay, "His good Joanna had &s;poiled him for living with any other woman."</P>
<P>It was then propo&s;ed to him to live with one of his daughters, who was married in the neighborhood. He had thought of that, he &s;aid, but an old man was always giving offence to one or another, and one or another was always giving offence to him. Be&s;ides, he &s;aid, his daughter had &s;everal children, and &s;o much noi&s;e did not &s;uit his quiet way of living. He could now, at his own ea&s;e, follow his own inclination. In &s;hort, it appeared, that while he lived, he wi&s;hed to live entirely to him|&s;elf; and that it was very indifferent to him when, and where, and how he died.</P>
<P>The de&s;titute condition, however in which he lived, laid him open to the depredations of a di&s;hone&s;t neigh|borhood. Many little thefts, when he was watched out of his hou&s;e, were committed. Among other things his pewter flaggon was &s;tolen. It hung over his dre&s;&s;er, and contained all his little &s;ecurities, and promi&s;&s;ory notes.&mdash;He had, however, with his u&s;ual &s;agacity, placed his money in &s;uch &s;afe hands, that he had, on this occa&s;ion, no lo&s;s.</P>
<P>But among the petty thefts, which were committed in his hou&s;e, was a robbery of a very &s;erious nature.&mdash;On the day before Lymington fair the old man had re|ceived &s;ome intere&s;t money (about five guineas) to pur|cha&s;e a few nece&s;&s;aries. This being probably known, two men, at midnight, broke into his hou&s;e. His fa&s;ten|ing indeed was only &s;uch as a good &s;hake might ea&s;ily <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">lodge. They &s;oon entered, and one of them pre&s;&s;ing a bol&s;ter over his face, pinned him down with his knee,
<PB N="71" REF="035296_0070_1001C0D80FA3A598">while the other &s;ought for the money, which was pre|&s;ently found. I heard him &s;peak of the tran&s;action the next day, and his behaviour rai&s;ed him in my opinion. He &s;poke with the caution of an hone&s;t man. The thieves had a dark lantern, he &s;aid, with them, and he thought he could &s;wear to one of them, but he dur&s;t not venture it, where a man's life and character were con|cerned.</P>
<P>From &s;everal circum&s;tances, however, it became more probable, that the man, whom Baker &s;u&s;pected, was guilty. And indeed he him&s;elf &s;oon after confirmed the &s;u&s;picion; for as the neighbors began more to talk of the thing, and to lay facts together, he thought it pru|dent to leave the country.&mdash;Indeed if wicked men would only con&s;ider before hand the many circum&s;tances that lead to di&s;covery, and the almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ibility of provid|ing again&s;t them all, they would be more cautious, on the mere principles of prudence, in committing any des|perate wickedne&s;s. One circum&s;tance which tended to &s;ix the &s;u&s;picion of the fact on this man, was, that a child accidentally mentioned having &s;een a cut chee&s;e in his hou&s;e the day after the robbery. Baker had lo&s;t a cut chee&s;e, and it was well known the man had no chee&s;e in his hou&s;e before. The other per&s;on too was &s;u&s;pect|ed; but if either of them had been taken up, it would, mo&s;t probably, have di&s;covered both: for a knave can|not be depended on. And, indeed, it is probable, that both would have been di&s;covered, had it not been for the the old man's &s;cruples.&mdash;I mention all the&s;e circum&s;tan|ces, to &s;hew that, in fact, it requires more care and cau|tion to commit a wicked action than mo&s;t men po&s;&s;e&s;s. It is, indeed, l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;s difficult to be Indu&s;trious, and by that means to make a wicked action unnece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding, however, the old man was thus &s;o frequently preyed on by wicked people, he &s;till continu|ed to live alone. As to any farther lo&s;&s;es, he had one w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">, he &s;aid or preventing them, and that was, to keep
<PB N="72" REF="035296_0071_1001C0DD56848E90">nothing about him that was worth <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tealing. He fa&s;ten|ed, therefore, the old bolt upon his door, and went to &s;leep in his lonely cottage as quietly as if he had b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">n in a ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>Though he had now enough before him, he continu|ed &s;till to live with his u&s;ual frugality. Many of his neighbors thought he might have indulged his age a lit|tle more, as he had the means to do it; and as they them&s;elves probably would have done in the &s;ame cir|cum&s;tances, by which they might have &s;pent all they had laid up for their old age, not knowing how long God might have lengthened out their lives. He lived, how|ever, as he had been accu&s;tomed to live, in the be&s;t of his days; for in many parts of his life he had been put to &s;hifts. He had always good chee&s;e in his hou&s;e, and good bread which was his common food. He u&s;ed to brew al&s;o now and then a bu&s;hel of malt; &s;o that he was &s;eldom without a little ca&s;k of beer. His garden produced him plenty of cabbages, which was the only plant he reared; and every year he bought at Lyming|ton fair a &s;ide of bacon, a bit of which he would now and then put into his pot with a cabbage. Fre&s;h meat he never ta&s;ted, nor were butter and tea among his neces|&s;aries. On this provi&s;ion he never had a day's &s;ickne&s;s; and even at tho&s;e times when his food was le&s;s nouri&s;h|ing, he was able to do every thing to which the &s;trength of man is equal&mdash;What can the art of cookery do more?</P>
<P>He was now near eighty; his limbs began to fail; and he was &s;ubject to rheumatic pains, which &s;eized his right leg, and made exerci&s;e very trouble&s;ome to him.&mdash;Notwith&s;tanding, however, this infirmity, and his liv|ing a mile from the church, he rarely mi&s;&s;ed taking a painful walk to it every Sunday. The weather mu&s;t have been very bad to prevent him. And though he was now become very deaf, he did not think even that a rea|&s;on for keeping from church&mdash;What an example did he &s;et to tho&s;e, who, though in perfect health, in&s;tead of
<PB N="73" REF="035296_0072_1001C0DF37AC1B10">making the &s;abbath a day for obtaining in&s;truction, and begging God's ble&s;&s;ing on the week, profane it by mak|ing it a day of pa&s;time, and often a day of drinking and other wickedne&s;s. He was con&s;tant al&s;o at the &s;acra|ment, which he always e&s;teemed a part of his duty.</P>
<P>He was confined to his hou&s;e about &s;ix weeks before he died. His illne&s;s was a mere decay of nature. His legs &s;welled, and his con&s;titution was broken up. He now &s;ubmitted to have &s;omebody live in his cottage with him. He was pre&s;&s;ed to &s;end for a phy&s;ician, as he had the means to pay him, but he was re&s;olute again&s;t it.&mdash;"If you could find me a doctor," &s;aid he, "who would tell me at once, I can do you good&mdash;or I cannot do you good, I would &s;end for him; but el&s;e, why &s;hould I &s;end for a man to be paid for giving me phy&s;ic, when I can|not take victuals?"&mdash;In &s;hort, he knew he was dying, and wi&s;hed to die with as little mole&s;tation as he could.</P>
<P>He kept his bed about three days; and was &s;en&s;ible to the la&s;t. He was in con&s;iderable pain, but he bore it with that firmne&s;s and manline&s;s with which he had &s;up|ported all the hard duties of a con&s;tant life of indu&s;try. He died on the 15th day of May, 1791, and de&s;ired that the 51&s;t p&s;alm might be &s;ung before his corp&s;e, as he was carried through the church-yard to his grave. The tho't was new, and the decency and propriety of it had a good effect.</P>
<P>On his death his effects amounted to about four hun|dred pounds. That a man, in the lowe&s;t &s;tation, with a con&s;tant attention to money, &s;hould, in the cour&s;e of a long life, rai&s;e that &s;um, or a greater, is not wonderful: but that a man, in the lowe&s;t &s;tation, &s;hould leave &s;uch a &s;um behind him, after di&s;charging all the offices of life with uprightne&s;s and propriety, is &s;uch an example of an independent &s;pirit, and of the force of indu&s;try and frugality, as de&s;erves to be recorded for the benefit of others.&mdash;The following in&s;cription &s;tands over his grave in Boldre church-yard.</P>

<P>IT is the happine&s;s of our religion, that all mankind, poor and rich, are equally able to plea&s;e God. The lowe&s;t may be as acceptable in his Maker's &s;ight as the highe&s;t; nor are any man's &s;ervices &s;o mean, as to be overlooked by his great Ma&s;ter. Before chri&s;tianity, in|deed, men were apt to think, that &s;uch only as had the powerful means of doing good, could obtain the favor of God, and that low people could do little to plea&s;e him. But the go&s;pel informs us, that God does not regard <HI>the action</HI> without <HI>the heart,</HI> from which the action pro|ceeds; and that the <HI>willing mind,</HI> though unaccompa|nied by the action, is as plea&s;ing in God's fight, as the <HI>action it&s;elf.</HI> So that, you &s;ee, the rich and poor are all equally in God's favor. Let each of us only do his du|ty in his proper &s;tation, <HI>as to the L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rd, and not unto man</HI>
<PB N="75" REF="035296_0074_1001C0EEC9F149C0">&mdash;that is, with a de&s;ire to plea&s;e God, who has placed us in our &s;everal &s;tations, and the lowe&s;t of us &s;hall be among&s;t tho&s;e, to whom the text is applied: <HI>Well done, good and faithful &s;ervant; thou ha&s;t been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.</HI></P>
<P>But now, my brethren, among the duties of our &s;e|veral &s;tations, there are &s;ome, which equally belong both to rich and poor; and there are &s;ome which belong to one &s;tation rather than the other.&mdash;Let me explain my meaning to you.</P>
<P>Among the&s;e duties, which belong to both, may be reckoned tho&s;e duties which we owe to God&mdash;love, tru&s;t, reverence, prayer. Such al&s;o are the duties of reading, and meditating on &s;cripture&mdash;of ob&s;erving the &s;abbath &mdash;of faith in our Redeemer&mdash;of attending the Lord's Supper. Such al&s;o are humility&mdash;hone&s;ty&mdash;a de&s;ire to &s;erve our neighbor, as far as we can&mdash;the care of our families&mdash;and other duties that might be mentioned.&mdash; All the&s;e are equally required from the poor and rich; becau&s;e the poor may perform them as well as the rich.</P>
<P>But there are other duties which are <HI>not thus equally</HI> required. As the rich man abounds in the things of this world, it is required of him to be <HI>generous and cha|ritable;</HI> becau&s;e God hath enabled him to be &s;o. But as the poor man cannot be generous and charitable, like the rich man, it is rather required of him to be <HI>indus|trious</HI> and <HI>frugal.</HI></P>
<P>On the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, therefore, I &s;hall make the duties of <HI>indu&s;try</HI> and <HI>frugality</HI> the &s;ubject of my dis|cour&s;e. I mention them together, becau&s;e they mu&s;t al|ways keep company, to be of any u&s;e. <HI>Frugality</HI> can do little without <HI>indu&s;try:</HI> and <HI>indu&s;try</HI> as little with|out <HI>frugality.</HI>&mdash;I &s;hall give you the chief rea&s;ons, which &s;hould incline you to the practice of the&s;e duties.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, I would have you con&s;ider what the &s;cripture &s;ays on this &s;ubject. It is often touched upon;
<PB N="76" REF="035296_0075_1001C0F3B3176FF0">but one of the mo&s;t remarkable pa&s;&s;ages is that of St. Paul to the The&s;&s;alonians. <HI>When we were with you, this we commanded you, that if any would not work, neither &s;hould he eat: for we hear there are &s;ome among you which walk di&s;orderly, working not at all. Now &s;uch we command, and exhort by our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, that with quietne&s;s they work, and eat their own bread.</HI> &mdash;Now this command that we &s;hould all <HI>eat our own bread</HI> is plainly founded on this rea&s;on, that nobody has a right to eat the bread of others, if he be able to pro|cure his own.&mdash;In &s;ome ca&s;es, no doubt, the pari&s;h al|lowance is a nece&s;&s;ary relief&mdash;as when the father of a family is taken off, while his children are yet young&mdash; or when a family, perhaps, is greatly vi&s;ited by &s;ickne&s;s &mdash;or when a family is uncommonly large. But how many are there who &s;hamefully run to the pari&s;h for relief, without any nece&s;&s;ity of this kind? The&s;e are people who either want <HI>indu&s;try</HI> in providing for their families&mdash;or <HI>frugality,</HI> in not making the be&s;t u&s;e of what they provide. They frequent the ale-hou&s;e, or they &s;pend what they have in good eating, or in other things, which are not nece&s;&s;ary. Let them con&s;ider how directly they break a &s;cripture command, by <HI>eating o|ther men's bread for nought,</HI> and by <HI>becoming charge|able</HI> without nece&s;&s;ity.</P>
<P>It may be hoped, that with chri&s;tians a &s;cripture com|mand may have &s;ufficient weight. However, I &s;hall en|deavor to &s;hew you more at large, on what <HI>rea&s;on</HI> this <HI>&s;cripture command</HI> is founded.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, how de&s;irable is it to &s;ee your lit|tle habitations as clean, neat, and well furni&s;hed as any of your neighbors&mdash;to &s;ee your children decently cloth|ed &mdash;to give them what little education you can&mdash;to have them taught to read, which may be a comfort to them during their lives&mdash;to have them taught to &s;pin and work, which may give them early habits of dili|gence. But all this cannot be done without great indus|try
<PB N="77" REF="035296_0076_1001C0F871F5EEA8">and frugality in the parent.&mdash;You have a choice, therefore, before you, whether it is better to do all this&mdash; at lea&s;t to do it in the be&s;t manner you can&mdash;or to idle away your time, or &s;pend your money in drinking at ale|hou&s;es? How often are the children of idle parents &s;ent to poor-hou&s;es, where their fathers' &s;ins are vi&s;ited up|on them in all the wretchedne&s;s, mi&s;ery, and neglect which the poor little &s;ufferers are too often obliged to undergo.&mdash;Much have tho&s;e parents to an&s;wer for!&mdash;I have my&s;elt heard &s;ome of the&s;e idle parents alledge, that, as they made their money them&s;elves, they had a right to &s;pend it as they plea&s;ed.&mdash;To tell &s;uch people, that no man has a farther right to any thing, which God has given him, than to make a proper u&s;e of it, would be to little purpo&s;e, yet &s;urely they mu&s;t &s;ee the force of this, that if they marry, and have families, their families &s;hould be con&s;idered as a part of them&s;elves, and have &s;urely a right not only to their maintenance, but to the be&s;t in|&s;truction and care their parents can be&s;tow. Who is the proper per&s;on to take care of the children but the parent?</P>
<P>I would have you con&s;ider farther, that <HI>indu&s;try</HI> and <HI>frugality</HI> are virtues which have a particular tendency to keep you out of the way of temptation and mi&s;chief.

<P>Such was the life of our very re&s;pectable neigh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">
<PB N="80" REF="035296_0079_1001C10425D25F80">who&s;e remains lie before us. His &s;tation in life, you know, was only that of a common day-laborer: but, as far as I could judge, he &s;et ju&s;t &s;uch an example in that &s;tation: and behaved exactly as he ought to have done. He had that generous independent &s;pirit, which I have been recommending to you, that &s;corned to live upon the labors of others; and &s;eemed to lay it down as a principle from the beginning of his life, to be obliged, under God, only to his own labor. By this alone he bred up a large family, without receiving a &s;ingle far|thing from the pari&s;h. But this could not have been done without great indu&s;try, and frugality. He worked hard; he lived hard: denying him&s;elf every indulgence in eating and drinking, that he might not be a burden to others.&mdash;When his family was off his hands, he tho't, for the &s;ame rea&s;on, it was proper for him to lay up a little for his old age. While he <HI>could,</HI> therefore, he con|tinued &s;till to work; and lived in the &s;ame hard man|ner; which was now become quite ea&s;y; and habitual to him.&mdash;It plea&s;ed God to ble&s;s his labor; he laid up &s;o much as maintained him, during his old age; and he has left &s;omething behind him to be a comfort to his children, if they make a right u&s;e of it. He never could be &s;aid to be wholly pa&s;t his labor. Till within a few weeks of his death, he every day worked a little; and it became an agreeable amu&s;ement to him. He had, all his life, been u&s;ed to laborious working. Many a time I have heard him &s;ay, that, in general, laborers now did not know what it was to work: and I have heard others &s;ay, who knew him better than I did, that he would have done as much in one day, as many people, do in two.</P>
<P>I have heard &s;ome of his neighbors tax him with be|ing a mi&s;er and covetous; and &s;ay, that as he might have lived more comfortably in his old age, his hard living could be owing only to a covetous temper. He might it is true, have lived more comfortable in his old age, as
<PB N="81" REF="035296_0080_1001A37BC5D96408"><HI>they</HI> may think, who accu&s;e him&mdash;and who are fonder of indulgence than he was: but he could not have lived more comfortably to him&s;elf, than he did: and I am per&s;uaded no man had ever le&s;s of the mi&s;er in his heart, But let me defend the character of my good old neigh|bor in this particular: let me &s;hew you the difference between his temper, and that of a mi&s;er.</P>
<P>A mi&s;er hoards money for <HI>its own &s;ake.</HI> He does not con&s;ider the u&s;e it is to an&s;wer; not indeed puts it to any u&s;e at all. Hoarding it up is all he has in view. He <HI>loves money.</HI> You remember an in&s;tance of a per&s;on, not many years ago in this pari&s;h, who expired gra&s;ping his pur&s;e, under his bed-cloths, to his heart. Perhaps he meant to &s;ecure it, if he &s;hould recover; but it plainly appeared to be his fir&s;t care; and if any &s;hould charge him with a love of money, I &s;hould not know how to defend him.</P>
<P>With covetou&s;ne&s;s, or a love of money, there is often mixed&mdash;indeed, I believe generally, a little knavery. If he who <HI>loves money</HI> do not openly cheat, he has many, ways of practi&s;ing little under-hand, dirty tricks, which an upright man would hardly call hone&s;t.&mdash;I give you the be&s;t &s;ide of him, for the mi&s;er is generally a very wicked character. The apo&s;tle indeed tells us, that the <HI>love of money is the root of all evil.</HI></P>
<P>Had our worthy decea&s;ed neighbor the&s;e &s;igns of a mi&s;er about him? As to his integrity, I dare take up|on me to &s;ay, a more upright, hone&s;t man never lived. Many di&s;hone&s;t practices, I have heard of in the pari&s;h &mdash;many little knavi&s;h tricks, I have &s;een, to take advan|tages, and get money, but I never heard of one action in the whole long life of our decea&s;ed neighbor, that was not fair, and hone&s;t, and upright in the highe&s;t degree: and I doubt not but you can all join with me in bear|ing this te&s;timony. So far then you will allow, that no|thing of the temper of a mi&s;er yet appears. How &s;hould there? there was no foundation for it. He had no love
<PB N="82" REF="035296_0081_1001C1096C6AF8C0">for money, merely for its own &s;ake, but as it might be the means of carrying him independently to the end of his life&mdash;and if he did not &s;pend it all, that the remain|der might be of &s;ome little u&s;e to his family. I have known him to do what in his circum&s;tances were even generous things. Where he thought it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;pend his money, he &s;pent it freely. He lived hard indeed, but whom did that hurt? It enabled him to do many a kind thing; but nobody ever &s;uffered from it but him&s;elf. It is not <HI>living hard,</HI> it is not <HI>laying up money,</HI> that makes a man a mi&s;er; but it is the intention with which he lives hard&mdash;it is the intention with which he lays up the money. Our late neighbor's intention was merely that of an independent &s;pirit, which could not bear to be &s;up|ported by other people's labor. He lived hard him&s;elf, le&s;t, if he had indulged him&s;elf, he &s;hould afterwards have been obliged to live on the labors of others.&mdash;And is there any thing in this like a love for money? He had no love for money that interfered, I dare take upon me to &s;ay, with any one duty that belonged to his &s;tation. How little he valued it for its own &s;ake, I had many op|portunities of &s;eeing, as mo&s;t of his money pa&s;&s;ed thro' my hands. Some years ago, you remember his hou&s;e was broken open: he mentioned his lo&s;s to me, not like a rai&s;er, but as far as his money was concerned, with chri&s;tian indifference. His chief di&s;tre&s;s was for tho&s;e, who had done the deed. To him, he &s;aid, they had done little injury. By the ble&s;&s;ing of God, he doubted not but he had enough to &s;upport him while he lived; and it was owing, I believe, more to his lenity and &s;cruple<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> than to the want of evidence, that the thieves were not convicted. So far from having any thing covetous about him, he appeared always to me entirely di&s;engaged from, all worldly thoughts, &s;trongly impre&s;&s;ed with a &s;en&s;e o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> religion, and ready to leave all behind him with the ut|mo&s;t indifference, and begin his great journey to eter|nity at a moment's warning, whene<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> it &s;hould p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">

<P>Thus, through a very long life he pa&s;&s;ed innocently, religiou&s;ly, inoffen&s;ively, and quietly to that grave, to which we now con&s;ign him.

<HEAD>THE TWO SOLDIERS.</HEAD>
<P>TWO &s;oldiers, Robert Wells and I&s;aac Clark, had obtained a three month's furlow from their col|onel, to vi&s;it their relations and friends in a very di&s;tant part of England. On their return to join their regiment, which was quartered at Glouce&s;ter, having travelled till they were weary, they propo&s;ed lying by for the night, at a little alehou&s;e called the Green Dragon, near the road-&s;ide.</P>
<P>Wells ob&s;erving the hou&s;e was pretty much throng|ed with company, propo&s;ed to his companion to journey on to the next, where they might &s;pend the night in more quiet, than the pre&s;ent pro&s;pect of things offered at the Green Dragon.</P>
<P>I'll not &s;tir a &s;tep further to-night, &s;aid Clark, for where there is good company and good liquor, there I'll make my head-quarters; &s;o throwing his knap&s;ack on the hor&s;e-block, down he &s;at him&s;elf.</P>
<P>The Green Dragon was famous for brewing the be&s;t ale in tho&s;e parts, and of cour&s;e became the general ren|dezvous of all the five-players, and &s;kittle-players in the country; &s;o very famous indeed was the liquor, that it introduced beggary and famine among&s;t the wives and children in all the neighboring cottages.</P>
<P>A &s;ilver-laced hat had been bowled for that evening, and the prize was won by a young farmer, who &s;pying our travellers, &s;wore a tremendous oath they &s;hould drink a bumper to the king's health.</P>
<P>After they had drunk plentifully, Wells twiched his comrade by the &s;houlder, and propo&s;ed that they &s;hould
<PB N="85" REF="035296_0084_1001C119875096D0">proceed on their march, now they had been refre&s;hed with a friendly mug; Clark, with an oath, refu&s;ed to comply, again repeating "the &s;oldier's be&s;t head-quar|ters was at the head of the beer barrel;" it &s;hall never be &s;aid, Wells, that I&s;aac Clark was a &s;tarter, where the li|quor was found, and the company good.</P>
<P>The liquor is very good &s;ure enough, &s;aid Wells, who was naturally a very &s;ober fellow, but enough is as good as a fea&s;t: and as to the company, I never be|held a wor&s;e &s;et of drunken, &s;wearing rebrobates in my life, for which rea&s;on let us on, for if we cannot make them better, they may make us wor&s;e.</P>
<P>Thou art always for preaching Bob, &s;aid Clark, as if a body were going to die; why I was never In better health in my life; and 'tis time enough to be &s;orry for one's &s;ins, when the la&s;s gla&s;s is out, &s;o halloo Tap, bring us another pot.</P>
<P>Thus in &s;pite of the per&s;ua&s;ions of poor Wells, he went on calling for another mug, and another till he was as drunk as a bea&s;t; and his brains whirled round like the vanes of a wind-mill. Unhappily in &s;ome degree, Wells fell into the &s;ame error; but unaccu&s;tomed to take more than his pint, and being quite overcome with fa|tigue, he felt him&s;elf extremely di&s;ordered, and &s;tag|gering into the fre&s;h air; he fell flat on the gra&s;s plat, where he lay in a dead &s;leep all night; nor did he awake till the day was pretty far advanced; when his teeth chattered in his head, and his limbs &s;hivered with cold, for the night was damp and mi&s;ty. As &s;oon as he was able to &s;tand, he &s;taggered in &s;earch of Clark, whom he found in a &s;till more deplorable &s;tate, for he had continu|ed drinking till he was as mad as the re&s;t of his compa|nions: They grew quarrel&s;ome at length, and each took offence at the other, till words proceeded to blows, and Move ended in blood; for a very profligate young but|cher, &s;truck his neighbor the &s;hoemaker &s;uch a violent blow acro&s;s the head with a quart pot, that his &s;kull was

<P>Our travellers left the Green Dragon, Clark's head was &s;till too confu&s;ed with liquor to permit him to think; but Wells, who was now quite come to him&s;elf, was overcome with &s;hame; and inwardly vowed, that if the entertainment he met with at the Dragon was called a merry making, he would never de&s;ire to be merry again for the re&s;t of his days; for what good have we obtain|ed by it, &s;aid he, but empty pockets, bloody no&s;es, ach|ing bones, and the rod of ju&s;tice hanging over our heads? Be&s;ides what is &s;till wor&s;e, muttered he to him&s;elf, by being overtaken in liquor, we have lo&s;t our rea&s;on, which was the gift of God, and was given man as a precious token of his favor, to di&s;tingui&s;h him from the brute-bea&s;t that peri&s;heth.</P>
<P>Clark as they journeyed on, was &s;piteful, &s;ullen, and &s;ulky: Now and then muttering, that &s;pite of the pa&s;t he would get good ale wherever it was to be had.</P>
<P>And I, &s;aid Wells, would make a vow to drink wa|ter for the re&s;t of my days, rather than ever make my|&s;elf a bea&s;t again, for I have a character to maintains and a &s;oul to be &s;aved.&mdash;And I'll tell thee Bob what is my de&s;ign, rejoined Clark, to &s;wim in &s;trong beer when|ever I can find it, if poverty and death both &s;tared me in the face.</P>

Why, I would rather &s;pend the next night in bat|tle, for there I &s;hould be performing my duty to my king and country, than in another &s;uch a riot at the Green Dragon.</P>
<P>Thou art a wi&s;h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> wa&s;hy fellow, replied Clark, thou with never die GAME, if for every little offence thou art &s;o plagued with qual<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">s of con&s;cience: I am acre-mined to live my own way, both, come on't what will. Then take my word for it, &s;aid Wells, thy ruin is nor far off; for though in a fit of bravery thou maye&s;t no|pear to &s;nake off the fear of God, the Devil may give up thy indentures at the la&s;t, and the law may take hold of thee in the mean time.</P>
<P>Then coming to a fine &s;tream of water, Wells &s;toop|ed down, and taking up &s;ome in his hat, drank plenti|fully of it, &s;aying it cooled the fever in his &s;tomach.&mdash; Clark &s;aid he was feveri&s;h al&s;o, but he &s;hould cool his think with a gla&s;s of be&s;t Holland's at the next alehou&s;e, which they &s;aw at &s;ome di&s;tance on the &s;ide of the bill.</P>
<P>There, however, they agreed to &s;top: After having made a plentiful breakfa&s;t, they called for their bill, when, to their great di&s;may, they found their pockets entirely emptied of ca&s;h, except two &s;hillings and a few halfpence, each having lo&s;t between two and three gui|neas, which had been given them by their friends to de|fray the expen&s;es of their journey.</P>
<P>By what means they had been &s;tripped of their ca&s;h, they could not imagine; whether the landlord had made
<PB N="88" REF="035296_0087_1001BF6955257F78">free with their pockets to pay him&s;elf, or that it had &s;lip|ped out in the general &s;cuffle; they were greatly dis|mayed, however, by their misfortune, for they had more than fifty miles to travel, and not more than ten pence left after the pre&s;ent expen&s;es were di&s;charged; and when the night came on, they were compelled to &s;eek the mo&s;t comfortable lodging they could find under a hay-&s;tack.</P>
<P>We ought not to complain of our hard fate, &s;aid Wells, &s;ince what we are about to &s;uffer is but part of the puni&s;hment due to our folly. With &s;obriety, and good management, our money would have enabled us to travel comfortably, and at the end of our journey we &s;hould have had plenty to &s;pare, to have given a treat to our comrades, who have been often kind to us on a like occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>I'll never return to the regiment to be laughed at, &s;aid Clark mutteringly: I am almo&s;t fami&s;hed to death &mdash;I'll de&s;ert. Prithee I&s;aac, &s;aid Wells, look well to thy words, and before thou art tempted to commit a great &s;in, a&s;k thy&s;elf, how thou &s;halt like to bear the puni&s;h|ment when thou art &s;ound out: and if thou &s;houlde&s;t e&s;cape being brought to ju&s;tice while on earth, it will find thee out in the day of judgment. Take my word for it, he is the only free, and, I may add, happy man, who is always doing the work of Him who made him. Talk no more of de&s;ertion then, dear I&s;aac, let us cear our misfortune like men, and as our catechi&s;in &s;ays, pati|ently re&s;olve to do "our duty in that &s;tate of life unto "which it hath plea&s;ed God to call us."</P>
<P>When I was a child, Bee, &s;aid Clark, I never learnt my catechi&s;m; learning, which I have heard thee &s;ay, has kept thee out of &s;o many &s;crapes, I hated; for I was a boy of &s;pirit, I loved boxing, five-playing&mdash;and rob|bing of orchards a deal better th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> my book.</P>

Think no more of de&s;erting then, thou ha&s;t taken the king's money, and a &s;trong oath to &s;erve him faithfully, take care, then, that thy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">d coat be not &s;tained with black &s;pots. Con&s;ider we are all GENTLEMEN &s;oldiers, then let us not di&s;grace our&s;elves by carrying the bloody marks of the rod of correction on our backs; if thou art re&s;olved to behave &s;o as to de&s;erve puni&s;hment, don't murmur again&s;t the laws which mu&s;t inflict it. The laws, I&s;aac, are only made to protect hone&s;t men from the &s;nares of villians. &mdash;Courage man, don't de&s;pair of finding a breakfa&s;t in the morning; mayhap we may meet with &s;ome good, charitable, well di&s;po&s;ed people, to whom we will relate our misfortune, and our di&s;grace, for I &s;han't be a&s;ham|ed to a&s;k for bread, now my folly has reduced me to a&s;k for it.</P>
<P>This is fine talking, replied Clark, do as thou wilt, Bob, but my pride is above it; in this beggarly &s;tarv|ed condition I'll never join the regiment, to be &s;neered and jeered at by every one; &s;o I am re&s;olved to have my own way for once.</P>
<P>Then remember, I&s;aac, it is a dangerous thing for a man to give him&s;elf up to the evil of his ways: I am only talking to thee for thy good, and &s;ince thou art de|termined to have thy own way in every thing, I will only further advi&s;e thee to think, how thou can'&s;t bear puni&s;h|ment before thou committe&s;t a &s;in which will &s;ooner or later bring down the vengeance of the law again&s;t thee. Have a good heart man, pluck up, that we may be able
<PB N="90" REF="035296_0089_1001BF6D9297B848">to begin our march by break of day; and, as I &s;aid be|fore, we may meet with &s;ome kind a&s;&s;i&s;tance on the road; this is a charitable land, I&s;aac, and there are few people in it who are not ready to relieve di&s;tre&s;s, when it is known to be real; and if we &s;hould be repul&s;ed at a &s;urly door, we mu&s;t not be angry, and unforgiving, &s;ince the kind hearts of the wealthy are &s;o often impos|ed upon, by fal&s;e &s;tories of misfortunes, that it often &s;huts up their bowels of compa&s;&s;ion, when real mi&s;ery &s;tands before them.&mdash;Man's nature, Clark, becomes &s;u&s;picious, when it has often been impo&s;ed upon.</P>
<P>My pride now is to meet our regiment before the time of our furlow is expired; it will give us great cre|dit with our colonel, who is the very be&s;t of men, and who, &s;eeing that we have made a generous u&s;e of the power intru&s;ted to us, will not be afraid to indulge us again, at a &s;it time. For &s;even years that I have been in the regiment, I have never received an ill word, or an unkind look from my officers, becau&s;e I always made it my plea&s;ure to do my duty.</P>
<P>My plea&s;ure then, replied Clark, is to have my own way; I don't care a ru&s;h for any man, I don't care for the general, I don't care for the colonel, nor I don't care for the captain&mdash;&s;o I have made up my mind as to that matter&mdash;I'll have food whil&s;t I can eat it&mdash;drink when I can get it&mdash;and money and plea&s;ure wherever I can find them.</P>
<P>Clark, thou do&s;t make me tremble &s;adly, &s;aid Wells, to hear thee talk &s;o de&s;perately; do turn thy thoughts to|wards God, for there &s;eems to be a &s;trong temptation upon thee&mdash;humble thy&s;elf before him, tell him thou art a mi&s;erable &s;inner, and beg his mercy to a&s;&s;i&s;t thee in thy di&s;tre&s;s&mdash;don't go on adding &s;in to &s;in; we have been both guilty of an heinous fault; let us take this les|&s;on of in&s;truction out of it, and re&s;olve to do &s;o no more. My father was an hone&s;t laborer, and he u&s;ed to tell all his children, that drunkenne&s;s was &s;ure to bring three
<PB N="91" REF="035296_0090_1001BF6FA09F5568">evils to every laboring man, namely.&mdash;&s;ickne&s;s, hunger, and rags; be&s;ides no &s;in makes the heart &s;o hard as drunkenne&s;s. A drunkard is without pity, &s;ince he can behold his wife and children dying of famine, becau&s;e his own bea&s;tly appetite mu&s;t have its fill of liquor at the village alehou&s;e.</P>
<P>Thou <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rt preaching to a deaf man, interrupted Clark, I'll have my own way I tell thee again and again; it is time enough to rail again&s;t plea&s;ure, when one has no power left to enjoy it.</P>
<P>Thou wilt live to repent thy &s;ayings, take my word for it, &s;aid Wells; for my part I would rather eat a hard cru&s;t for my dinner, than dine with the officers on roa&s;t beef and plum pudding, if I mu&s;t do dirty work to ob|tain it. I would dine with any man, &s;aid Clark, who would give me a dinner, and drink with any man that would offer me his cup, though, perhaps, he did expect a little underhand bu&s;ine&s;s of me in return; I am re|&s;olved to &s;erve my&s;elf, Bob, and there's an end of my chapter.</P>
<P>And a &s;orrowful ending it is, an&s;wered Wells, and &s;o good night; drawing &s;ome of the loo&s;e hay about him, and placing his knap&s;ack under his head for a pillow: I &s;hall &s;ay my prayers, I&s;aac, for if I am taken off in my &s;leep, it is a good thing for a man to have had his la&s;t waking thoughts employed on the goodne&s;s of God.</P>
<P>Wells &s;lept &s;weetly, till the ri&s;ing &s;un &s;hining on his face awakened him: he called aloud to his companion, telling him it was time to prepare for their journey; he called again and again, but &s;till no an&s;wer was made him; he then ro&s;e to go in &s;earch of him, but he was no where to be found.</P>
<P>After waiting his return for near an hour, and find|ing he did not appear, he &s;et forward on his journey; after travelling &s;ome miles he began to find hunger very keen, and &s;eeing a low farm hou&s;e at a di&s;tance, he &s;truck acro&s;s a field and made up to it. Wells rapped at the
<PB N="92" REF="035296_0091_1001BF73488EEB00">door, which being opened by the mi&s;tre&s;s of the hou&s;e, he very mode&s;tly a&s;ked her to give him a cup of whey, or a draught of &s;mall beer, for he was a good deal dis|&s;tre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>Di&s;tre&s;&s;ed&mdash;aye, to be &s;ure, &s;aid &s;he, the times are &s;o hard, the world is full of di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>The hardne&s;s of the times, ma'am, &s;aid Wells, has nothing to do with my di&s;tre&s;s, &s;ince it is all the con&s;e|quence of my own folly.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t be an extraordinary man, Ma&s;ter Soldier, &s;aid Mrs. Jenkins, to confe&s;s that your own crimes have brought you to hunger.</P>
<P>I tell you nothing but the truth, &s;aid Wells, and hungry as I am, I would not impo&s;e a lie upon you, to obtain the be&s;t mouthful in your hou&s;e; people in general rail at the badne&s;s of the times, when nine times out of ten they owe their mi&s;ery to their extravagance; two nights ago my fellow traveller, and my&s;elf, accidently fell into bad company, we got drunk, and we lo&s;t our money; I have a journey of more than forty miles to make, and I have not a &s;ixpence left to furni&s;h me with provi&s;ions.</P>
<P>Follow me to the kitchen, &s;aid the good woman, and I will give you the be&s;t my hou&s;e affords; I love a &s;ol|dier to my heart, becau&s;e he fights for my country; but when I find a &s;oldier to be a chri&s;tian, I love him to my &s;oul, becau&s;e our country may &s;tand a better chance to be pre&s;erved from the enemy in time of war, if our &s;ol|diers are chri&s;tians; and &s;ince, my hone&s;t friend, you ha'n't the courage to tell a lie to God, I'm certain &s;ure you'll never fail in doing your duty towards your coun|try.</P>
<P>Wells now fed heartily on &s;ome cold pork and cab|bage, and drank prudently of an excellent mug of cy|der that &s;tood before him.</P>
<P>After &s;ilently thanking the Giver of all good for a ble&s;&s;ing &s;o little expected, and &s;o little de&s;erved, he was about to take his leave of his kind ho&s;te&s;s, when a hu&s;t|ling
<PB N="93" REF="035296_0092_1001C0B99514AAE0">was heard in the pa&s;&s;age, and &s;oon after the room was filled by a croud of people, in the mid&s;t of whom Wells &s;aw his unfortunate comrade Clark, with his hands tied behind him. His heart now mi&s;gave him, and it was as clear to him as the light, before it was ex|plained to him, that Clark had been as good as his word, and would have his own way let come on't what would. He was as pale as death, his jaws trembled, and the tears ran down his cheeks.</P>
<P>The farmer now explained to his wife that they had taken the villain who la&s;t night would have robbed the po&s;t-chai&s;e, but was prevented by a gentleman within it, who let fly a brace of pi&s;tols at him, which made him keep his di&s;tance; that early this morning, as he was riding to market, he him&s;elf had been attacked by him, before it was light, but &s;ome of the neighbors coming to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, they determined to pur&s;ue the rogue, and came up with him about two miles off, as he was entering an alehou&s;e. I have &s;ent to the &s;quire's, added the farmer, to adverti&s;e the gentleman who is at his hou&s;e, that the robber is taken, and I hope he will &s;oon be here.</P>
<P>Here poor Clark wept bitterly: Ah! Bob, Bob! &s;aid he, &s;pying Wells, had I taken thy kind advice, I &s;hould never have been brought to this&mdash;I &s;hould have lived like a man, and died like a chri&s;tian, but Lord have mer|cy upon me, what have I brought my&s;elf to! I have brought my life into danger, and may be have ruined my own &s;oul.</P>
<P>Hone&s;t Wells was grieved at heart: O I&s;aac! cried he, could I have pre&s;erved thee from &s;uch a grievous misfortune, I would have &s;hared my la&s;t mor&s;el with thee; my prayers are now all I can offer thee, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y prayer only thou can'&s;t &s;erve thy&s;elf, for the prayer of a penitent, even when offered up in a pri&s;on, may be ac|cepted: If by timely repentance, I&s;aac thou can'&s;t win the favor of Heaven, thou wilt find comfort under every affliction.</P>
<P><PB N="94" REF="035296_0093_1001BF766A001EF8">
Here the gentleman arrived who&s;e carriage had been &s;topped the preceding evening: Clark no &s;ooner caught a glimp&s;e of him than he knew him to be his own colo|nel. A man whom every per&s;on in the regiment loved and honored as a parent, O my gracious father! ex|claimed Clark, &s;eeing this honorable gentleman enter, my puni&s;hment is already greater than I can bear, if I have offended the man I would die to &s;erve. He then faint|ed away, but a little warm ale being given him, he &s;oon recovered, when the noble colonel &s;poke &s;o mildly, and kindly to him, that Mrs. Jenkins put her apron to her eyes.</P>
<P>Here Wells related to the colonel what had pa&s;&s;ed, he &s;hook like an a&s;pen leaf, when he came to relate the &s;orrowful adventures which befel them at the Green Dragon, and all the grief and affliction which had be|fallen him in con&s;equence <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"></P>
<P>When Wells had fini&s;hed his &s;tory&mdash;your father, Clark, &s;aid the colonel, could not feel more concern at your pre&s;ent &s;ituation than I do: I have always regard|ed every man in my regiment as my &s;on, for I have al|ways tried to win their affection by kindne&s;s rather than inforce their obedience by &s;everity. A man of true cour|age, Clark, abhors the thought of a ba&s;e action, but if he lives without principle in his heart, he mu&s;t not be &s;urpri&s;ed, if &s;ooner or later he is betrayed by his pa&s;&s;ions into the blacke&s;t &s;ins; and if he is taken in the com|mi&s;&s;ion of a crime he mu&s;t expect to pay the penalty of the law.</P>
<P>Poor Clark groaned and wept bitterly, while the col|onel thus continued&mdash;I am thankful that I wounded no man, when I fired my pi&s;tol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> on being &s;topped la&s;t night in my carriage. As the night was much too dark for me to be able to give evidence as to the identity of the per&s;on who &s;topped me, you may expect, Clark, that no bill of indictment will be preferred again&s;t you by me; it is a mo&s;t dreadful thing for any man to take an oath,
<PB N="95" REF="035296_0094_1001A2FAE510F7C8">when he is not po&s;itive as to the fact he is going to &s;wear to: the farmer, I fear, from having &s;ecured your per&s;on, has certain evidence to bring again&s;t you, but that is a bu&s;ine&s;s in which I have no right to interfere, as your examination mu&s;t take place before a neighbor|ing ju&s;tice of the peace. Whether the fact be, or be not proved again&s;t you, here is a title to &s;upport you, in ca&s;e you &s;hould get your di&s;charge, that you may not plead your wants as an excu&s;e for committing &s;uch a dreadful outrage again&s;t &s;ociety. After what is pa&s;t it will be highly improper to admit you again into the re|giment; in future <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">arn to labor with diligence, live &s;o|berly, then you will live hone&s;tly; be &s;teady and con|&s;tant in attending on all the duties which your church enjoins you&mdash;learn to fear God, honor the king, and be ju&s;t to your neighbor.</P>
<P>Tears now filled the eyes of all pre&s;ent, Mrs. Jenkins &s;obbed aloud, and every one declared, they had never heard &s;o moving a &s;ermon in their born days; they all &s;aid, what a fine thing &s;cholar&s;hip was when applied to chri&s;tian u&s;es, and what a pity it was the noble colonel could not be made a bi&s;hop.</P>
<P>The colonel conde&s;cended to &s;peak to Wells as kind|ly as if he had been his equal. As for you, hone&s;t Ro|bert, &s;aid he, your &s;teady conduct has long been the &s;ub|ject of my ob&s;ervation, and my prai&s;e among&s;t all my brother officers; the &s;obriety of your life, and your re|gularity at church makes you always ready in the per|formance of your duty. I have long had it in my tho'ts to procure you &s;ome promotion, without being able to obtain the means. An occa&s;ion has pre&s;ented it&s;elf in your ab&s;ence: Serjeant Jeffer&s;on is dead, and I have re|&s;erved his place for you. I know you can both write and ca&s;t accounts well: In this po&s;t I doubt not but you will exerci&s;e power with as much humility, as you have hitherto practi&s;ed obedience with cheerfulne&s;s; and &s;ince this little affray has cau&s;ed you much di&s;appoint|ment,
<PB N="96" REF="035296_0095_1001C0C99DA3CC90">and much delay on your journey, I will pay your fare, and your expen&s;es in the &s;tage-coach, which I find will pa&s;s this afternoon, that agreeably to your intentions you may join the regiment before the time of your fur|low is expired, in order that your conduct may &s;tand as an example to your comrades, that having been intru&s;t|ed with power, you had too high a &s;en&s;e of duty to a|bu&s;e it.</P>
<P>What makes the end of this little &s;tory very moving, and very in&s;tructive is, that while Wells, for his hone&s;ty and good conduct, was enabled by his colonel to fini&s;h his journey by the coach; at the very moment in which he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">unted the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ox, he &s;aw his unfortunate comrade, Clark, with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> hands tied behind him, carried off to the county <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ol, to take his trial at<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">e next a&s;&s;izes, &s;ore|ly lamenting his unhappy fate, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> the wilful ob&s;tinacy that made him deaf to the excellent advice of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ood a friend.</P>

<HEAD>THE HISTORY OF CHARLES JONES, THE FOOTMAN.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>WRITTEN BY HIMSELF.</BYLINE>
<P>MY Father, George Jones, commonly called Black George, on account of his &s;warthy com|plexion, was one of the mo&s;t indu&s;trious men in the whole village.&mdash;His cottage, which was his own, and partly built by his own hands, &s;tands on the Common, about a &s;tone's ca&s;t from the road, near the great oak-tree, in the pari&s;h of King's Charle&s;|ton, in &s;omer&s;et&s;hire.&mdash;The lord of the manor having granted him leave to inclo&s;e a bit of the common for a garden, my father had got a thriving young orch|ard, and a long &s;trip of potatoes, be&s;ides his cottage, all the produce of his own indu&s;try. It u&s;ed to be a favorite &s;aying with him, that no man, to whom God had given two hands, had ever need to want. "For my part, &s;ays he, I never knew what want was.&mdash; When I am &s;ick, the club &s;upports me; and when I am well. I warrant I'll &s;upport my&s;elf." My mo|ther, be&s;ides being equally indu&s;trious, was much more religious, and therefore much happier. She was as good and as &s;weet tempered a woman as any in the world, be the next where &s;he will. For con|&s;tancy at her place of wor&s;hip, civility to her neigh|bors, cleanline&s;s in her own per&s;on, her hou&s;e, and her children, &s;he had not her fellow. But the mo&s;t remarkable thing in her (I am afraid a very uncom|mon thing) was her &s;teady and uninterrupted practice of family prayer. It mu&s;t have been a hard day's
<PB N="4" REF="035296_0098_1001BF88B80913D8">work indeed that hindered her from her prayers.&mdash; At &s;ix in the morning, and eight in the evening, as regularly as ever the hour came, &s;he always knelt down, with her children round her (four of us) and read with great &s;olemnity and devotion, a &s;hort form given her by the clergyman, which concluded with the Lord's prayer, in which we all joined. And &s;he u&s;ed to &s;ay after &s;he had fini&s;hed&mdash;"Now I can go to bed o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters"> work in peace; for now we may hope God will protect us."&mdash;I am &s;orry to &s;ay my father &s;el|dom joined with us. He u&s;ed to pretend he was bu|&s;y or tired; and yet it would not have detained him long neither, for we were never more than &s;ix min|utes about it, and &s;urely twelve minutes a day (&s;ix in the morning &amp; &s;ix in the evening) is no great time to give to God. One thing has often &s;truck me, that if any thing went wrong, and ruffled my dear mother's temper, or made her unea&s;y, the prayers &s;eemed to &s;et it all to rights. When &s;he had been to prayers, all her grief &s;eemed to be fled away. And, indeed, I ob&s;erved the &s;ame thing with re&s;pect to my father; if he ever did join with us, it always &s;eemed &s;omehow to compo&s;e and &s;weeten his mind, and make him a great deal kinder to my mother and us.</P>
<P>As my father and mother were very indu&s;trious them&s;elves, they were very de&s;irous to make their children &s;o; every child was employed, as &s;oon as he was able, in &s;omething or other. At about thir|teen years of age, my employment had been for &s;ome time to weed in the par&s;on's garden, and run of er|rands for him. At fourteen he took me into his hou&s;e, and not a little proud was I at obtaining the title of his "little footman." The morning I left my father's cottage, my dear mother, who was as kind as &s;he was good, appeared to be very much af|fected; &s;he &s;aid &s;he could not commit me to the wide world, without fir&s;t committing me to God, who go|verned
<PB N="5" REF="035296_0099_1001BF8B03685C38">it; and then &s;he knelt down with me by her &s;ide, and prayed, "Gracious Lord, be plea&s;ed to have mercy on my dear boy. To thy care I commend him. Guard him, I be&s;eech thee, in the many temp|tations he is now beginning to encounter. May he with &s;olid piety and hone&s;t diligence do his duty in that &s;tate of life in which it hath plea&s;ed thee to place him." She then gave me her ble&s;&s;ing, put a Te&s;ta|ment into my pocket, bid me fear God, and always act for my ma&s;ter as I would do for my&s;elf.</P>
<P>In my new &s;ituation there were, to be &s;ure, &s;ome &s;ew things di&s;agreeable. My mi&s;tre&s;s was peevi&s;h and fretful; the cook violent and pa&s;&s;ionate. But what &s;ervice is there, or indeed, what &s;ituation in life, how&s;oever much above &s;ervitude, in which there is not &s;omething unplea&s;ant. Every &s;tate has its trials: &s;ervants have theirs; but if they cannot learn to put up with &s;ome little inconveniences, they may charge their places every year of their lives, and ne|ver be &s;atisfied after all. This is a le&s;&s;on I have learnt by long experience.</P>
<P>Though, by God's ble&s;&s;ing, I had received a more religious education than mo&s;t children, it yet &s;oon appeared that I had many faults, which it was nece&s;&s;a|ry for me to be corrected of before I could become a good &s;ervant. At fir&s;t, when I was &s;ent upon an er|rand, I was much given to loitering. I was then too young to con&s;ider that by loitering in errands, I was wa&s;ting what was not my own, my ma&s;ter's time.&mdash; Be&s;ides this fault, as every thing which I &s;aw and heard in my ma&s;ter's hou&s;e, was &s;uch as I had never &s;een and heard before. I was too apt to talk of it to my old play-fellows, or at the village &s;hop. But as &s;oon as ever I became a little older, I began to reflect that this was very wrong. One Sunday evening, whon I had leave to go home to &s;ee my parents, I was beginning to tell my mother how there had been
<PB N="6" REF="035296_0100_1001BF906729A280">a great uproar at the par&s;onage the day before about &mdash;. Here &s;he put her hand upon my lips, and &s;aid, "Charles, not a word more of what has pa&s;&s;ed at the par&s;onage. What&s;oever happens in your ma&s;ter's hou&s;e is never to be &s;poken of out of your ma&s;ter's doors. A tale-bearing &s;ervant is always an unfaith|ful &s;ervant; he betrays the tru&s;t which his ma&s;ter puts in him."</P>
<P>My mother's vehemence &s;urprized me a little, but it made &s;o much impre&s;&s;ion upon me that I was pret|ty well broken of the fault from that very time. Into how many &s;crapes has this talkative temper brought many &s;ervants of my acquaintance! There was poor Nick Jarrett, the Squire's under footman, that lo&s;t his place, a new &s;uit of black broad cloth, and a lega|cy of five pounds, which he would &s;oon have had by rea&s;on of his ma&s;ter's death, only for &s;aying at a neigh|bor's hou&s;e, that his mi&s;tre&s;s &s;ometimes fell a&s;leep while the &s;quire was reading to the family on a Sun|day night.</P>
<P>Nick and I were at one time rather too intimate; I remember one day, when I was about &s;ixteen, hav|ing attended my ma&s;ter to the Squire's hou&s;e, Nick prevailed on me after dinner to play with him at pitch and to&s;s. I was worth at that time five &s;hillings and two-pence, more money than I had ever po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed before in my life. In about two hours Nick reduced me to my la&s;t &s;hilling. But though it was a heavy &s;troke at the time; yet it proved in the end a happy event, for, by my mother's per&s;ua&s;ions, I re&s;olved thencefor|ward never to game again as long as I lived, which re&s;olution, by God's grace, I have hitherto happily kept. I wi&s;h from my heart that all other &s;ervants would re&s;olve the &s;ame. The practice of card-play|ing, &s;o common among&s;t &s;ervants in large families, is the wor&s;t cu&s;tom they could po&s;&s;ibly fall into.&mdash;My poor brother Tom &s;uffered enough for it. One day,
<PB N="7" REF="035296_0101_1001BF96E44EB550">having received in the morning a quarter's wages, he lo&s;t the whole of it before night at All-fours; and what was the con&s;equence?&mdash;Why, from that very time, he took to tho&s;e practices of cheating his ma&s;ter which ended in his ruin. How much better would it be for all &s;ervants, if in&s;tead of wa&s;ting their lei&s;ure in card-playing, they would amu&s;e them&s;elves in read|ing &s;ome godly book, or improve them&s;elves in writing or cyphering. It was by this means, for I was nev|er taught to write, that I qualified my&s;elf for the place of Bailiff, which I now fill.</P>
<P>I remember Nick u&s;ed to &s;ay, "Whil&s;t my ma&s;ter plays cards in the parlour, why &s;hould&s;t thou be &s;o &s;queami&s;h as not to play in the kitchen." But Nick did not con&s;ider that his ma&s;ter being rich, and play|ing for &s;mall &s;ums, his lo&s;&s;es laid him under no temp|tation of di&s;hone&s;ty in order to repair them; be&s;ides, the Squire could read and write at any time, whereas this was our only lei&s;ure time, and if we did not im|prove our&s;elves than we never could; what might be comparatively innocent in him, might be ruinous to us. And even if my ma&s;ter be a profe&s;&s;ed gambler, that is no rea&s;on I &s;hould be &s;o too. A &s;ervant is to do what is right, let his ma&s;ter do what he will. If a ma&s;ter &s;wears and gets drunk, and talks at table with indecency, or again&s;t God and religion, to God he mu&s;t account for it, and a &s;orry account it will be I doubt; but his example will not excu&s;e our crimes, though it will aggravate his. We mu&s;t take care of our own &s;ouls, whether our ma&s;ters take care of theirs or not.</P>
<P>But to return to my hi&s;tory; I am a&s;hamed to &s;ay that I was guilty more than once in the earlier part of my &s;ervitude, of the &s;hocking and dete&s;table crime of lying in order to excu&s;e or &s;creen my faults.&mdash; Happily I was cured of it in the following manner: Having been one day ordered to carry a bottle of
<PB N="8" REF="035296_0102_1001BF9A9A73BA80">wine to a &s;ick man, one of my ma&s;ter's pari&s;hioners, I accidentally broke the bottle, and of cour&s;e, lo&s;t the wine. What was to be done? Should I confe&s;s my misfortune and acknowledge my carele&s;&s;ne&s;s, or conceal it by a lie? After &s;ome deliberation, I re&s;ol|ved upon the lie. I therefore had made up my &s;tory, "how the poor man &s;ent his duty to my ma&s;ter, and thanked him a thou&s;and times, and that he was a lit|tle better, and that his wife &s;aid &s;he thought this wine would &s;ave his life." Being thus prepared, as I was returning home, I met a pedlar, of whom I bought for a penny a little book, containing a &s;tory of a woman at Devizes, who was &s;truck dead on the &s;pot for tel|ling a lie. To be &s;ure it was heaven that &s;ent the pedlar to me, to &s;ave me from the &s;in I was going to commit. "If this woman was &s;truck dead for a lie," &s;aid I to my&s;elf, "why may not I?"&mdash;I therefore went directly home, and made a confe&s;&s;ion of my neg|ligence and misfortune. And it was well for me I did; for the &s;ick man, who&s;e duty and thanks I had wickedly intended to carry my ma&s;ter, was dead, as I under&s;tood afterwards, three hours before the bot|tle was broken. From this time, therefore, I began to &s;ee what I am now fully convinced of, that be&s;ides the &s;infulne&s;s of lying, it was always more for the intere&s;t and la&s;ting comfort of &s;ervants, to con&s;e&s;s the truth at once, than to conceal a fault by fal&s;|hood. When a &s;ervant has told a lie, he is always in danger of its being found out, and &s;ooner or later it generally is &s;ound out, and then his character is rumed. Whereas, if he confe&s;&s;es the truth at once, he probably e&s;capes without any anger at all, or it wor&s;t it is &s;oon over, and the fault it&s;elf is forgotten.</P>
<P>Having now lived &s;even years at the par&s;onage, &amp; being twenty-one years of age, my ma&s;ter called me one day into his &s;tudy, where he &s;pent a good deal of his time, and &s;aid to me, "Charles, you have lived
<PB N="9" REF="035296_0103_1001A2FCE56F5408">with me a con&s;iderable time, and it has been always with much plea&s;ure that I have remarked the decen|cy, &s;obriety and diligence of your conduct. Tho&s;e few faults which you have, farther experience and more years will I doubt not, cure. You are now qualified for a better place than mine, and are enti|tled to higher wages than it is in my power to give. I have therefore recommended you to a friend of mine in London, for which place you are to &s;et out, if you approve it, in a month. But I &s;hould think it a crime to di&s;mi&s;s you to a &s;ituation &s;o full of temp|tations, without giving you &s;ome little advice. Li&s;|ten, therefore, my dear Charles, to what I &s;hall &s;ay as I mean it only for your good. In the fir&s;t place fear God, and then you will never have any occa&s;ion to be afraid of man. Act always as in his pre&s;ence. Never enter or quit your bed without prayer. Do always for your ma&s;ter, as you would your ma&s;ter, if you were to change places, &s;hould do for you. En|deavour to get a pious friend, but avoid, as you would the plague, all wicked company. Be cautious of too great familiarity with your female fellow-&s;ervants; an unlawful intercour&s;e of this kind will ruin you, body and &s;oul. Flee from an ale-hou&s;e as you would from the Devil; if you once get into it, you will never be out of it. Keep your money and your money will keep you. Here, Charles, is a bible for you; the more you read it, the more you will love it, and the more you love it, the better you will be and the hap|pier. I have written &s;ome directions for you in the fir&s;t page of it. God! le&s;s you; and when my race which is now drawing to its end, &s;hall fini&s;h, may we meet in heaven." My ma&s;ter's kindne&s;s &s;o affected me, that I could not an&s;wer him for tears. I was indeed very glad of going to &s;o fine a place as Lon|don, though, at the &s;ame time. I could not leave a hou&s;e where I had been treated more like a child
<PB N="10" REF="035296_0104_1001BF9E1D3416E8">than a &s;ervant, without great regret. I &s;hall not at|tempt to de&s;cribe my parting with my mother. No de&s;cription, I am &s;ure, could do ju&s;tice to the &s;olemn and affectionate manner in which &s;he exhorted me to be pious and ju&s;t, and recommended me to God in prayer. Her la&s;t words I &s;hall never forget. "I know my dear &s;on," &s;aid &s;he, "that you love me ten|derly, and that you would not give me unnece&s;&s;ary pain on any account. Remember then, that whenever you do any wrong thing, you are planting a dagger in your mother's heart." With the&s;e words, her eyes brim full of tears, and her hands lifted up in &s;ilent prayer, to God &s;he turned away from me and went into the cottage.</P>
<P>And now, reader, you find me in the great and dangerous city of London, in the &s;ervice of a very wealthy ma&s;ter, who kept twelve &s;ervants be&s;ides my|&s;elf. If country people knew London as well as I do, how cautious they would be of exchanging their &s;afe and peaceful &s;ituations in the country, for the pe|rils and temptations of a great city. How many young fellows have I known, who lived hone&s;tly and happily in their native place, come up to London in hopes of higher wages, and there forfeit their integ|rity, their peace of mind, their health, their charac|ter and &s;ouls. Workmen in particular are very fond of getting into large cities, becau&s;e they think their labour will turn to better account there than in their own villages. They do not con&s;ider that in a city they mu&s;t give as much for a filthy room in a filthy hou&s;e, inhabited by half a dozen families, &s;ituated in a clo&s;e, &s;moky, dirty, &s;treet, as in the country would pay the rent of a cottage and a garden. They do not con&s;ider the dearne&s;s of provi&s;ions in a city, the temptations they are under from bad women, wicked company, and the great number of ale-hou&s;es. In &s;hort, I am fully per&s;uaded that a laborer in the
<PB N="11" REF="035296_0105_1001BFA2DB11B7D0">country, on a &s;hilling a day, is better off than one in the city on two &s;hillings.</P>
<P>When I came to my place, I found every thing for the fir&s;t three or four days very &s;mooth and very plea&s;ant, plenty of provi&s;ions, plenty of drink, little work, and a very merry &s;ervant's hall. But &s;oon the face of things, with re&s;pect to me, changed very much, and I underwent a &s;everer temptation than I ever experienced before or &s;ince in my life. I had always hitherto been taught to con&s;ider that &s;obriety and diligence, and piety were virtues. I therefore never &s;wore, I never got drunk, I never gamed, I went to church as often as I could, I &s;aid my prayers night and morning, and on Sunday at lea&s;t, if not on other days, I read a little in my good old ma&s;ter's bi|ble. But here I &s;oon found that all this was the wor&s;t vice I could be guilty of. As &s;oon as they found me out, it &s;eemed to be a trial of &s;kill among&s;t them who &s;hould plague me mo&s;t. One called me the Par&s;on; another, Methodi&s;t; a third, a conceited Prig; a fourth, a canting Hypocrite. If I went into any o|ther gentleman's kitchen it was all the &s;ame; my character always &s;lew before me, and many were the je&s;ts and laughs rai&s;ed both at home and abroad at my expen&s;e. In &s;hort, during three months, my life was a con&s;tant &s;tate of anxiety and torment; &s;o that at la&s;t I was almo&s;t tempted, God forgive me for the thought, to do as they did, and forfeit my everla&s;ting &s;oul in order to avoid pre&s;ent unea&s;ine&s;s. But while things were in this &s;tate, I felt my&s;elf greatly and unexpectedly relieved one Sunday morning, by a &s;er|mon which I happened to hear from our pari&s;h min|i&s;ter, on the following text&mdash;<HI>Blessed are ye when men shall revile you and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil of you falsely for my sake, for great is your reward in heaven.</HI> The excellent di&s;|cour&s;e which this pious man delivered on the&s;e words
<PB N="12" REF="035296_0106_1001BFAA62A045E8">was &s;o exactly &s;uited to my circum&s;tances and feel|ings, that it &s;eemed as if it had been addre&s;&s;ed &s;olely to me; and it plea&s;ed God &s;o to apply what had been &s;aid to my heart and under&s;tanding, that I not only determined to bear in <HI>future</HI> the &s;neers and &s;coffs of my fellow-&s;ervants, with patience and forti|tude, but even tho&s;e very &s;neers which I formerly con&s;idered as my heavie&s;t calamity, were now no longer grievous. From this time, therefore, my un|ea&s;ine&s;s was pretty well at an end. And I earne&s;t|ly recommend it to all other &s;ervants, who have been &s;o happy as to acquire &s;ober and virtuous habits, not to &s;uffer them&s;elves to be laughed out of their &s;obri|ety and virtue, by the je&s;ts and ridicule of their fel|low-&s;ervants. They may depend upon it that their cau&s;e is a good one, and though they &s;uffer for it at fir&s;t, they will finally triumph. In a &s;hort time all my per&s;ecution was at an end. "To be &s;ure," &s;aid the coachman one day to the cook, "Charles is a lit|tle too religious, but upon my word I don't think he is any the wor&s;e for it. Mayhap it might be better for us if we were more like him. I don't &s;ee but that he is as humble, friendly and worthy a fellow as any a|mong&s;t us. For my part I &s;hall laugh at him no lon|ger." This &s;peech which I happened accidentally to overhear, gave me great plea&s;ure, and I &s;oon found by the agreeable change in my fellow-&s;ervants' conduct towards me, that the coachman had expre&s;|&s;ed the opinion of the whole hall. It is true I did every thing to obtain their good-will, that lay in my power. I was as civil and obliging to every one a|mong them, as I po&s;&s;ibly could. Was any thing to be done? If nobody el&s;e would do it, I never &s;topped to con&s;ider whether it belonged to my place or not, but did it out of hand. If any body took it into his head to fall out with me, I generally di&s;armed him of
<PB N="13" REF="035296_0107_1001A2FE9B728128">his wrath by &s;aying nothing. If any little quarrels or misfortunes, or mi&s;conduct, happened in the hall, I always endeavoured to hu&s;h it up, and never car|ried any tales to the ma&s;ter, unle&s;s when I &s;aw any body wronging him, and then I thought it my duty, or unle&s;s the thing was very bad indeed. In &s;hort by pur&s;uing always this line of conduct, I found my &s;itu|ation very comfortable and agreeable. My ma&s;ter treated me with great confidence and kindne&s;s: my fellow-&s;ervants with great friendline&s;s and re&s;pect.</P>
<P>In about two years time, the footman that u&s;ed to go to market being turned away for drunkenne&s;s, which vice &s;oon proved his ruin, my ma&s;ter told me that as he believed I was an hone&s;t and careful young man, and perceiving that I could write and keep an account, he &s;hould in future employ me in marketing. To market, therefore, I went every day, and as I had now a good deal of my ma&s;ter's money always in my hands, I prayed heartily to God that he would be plea&s;ed to pre&s;erve me under the temptation to which this expo&s;ed me. My fir&s;t exploit in this way was the purcha&s;e of ten &s;hillings worth of fruit at a fruit|erer's. When I had fini&s;hed my bargain and was coming out of the &s;hop, the fruiterer &s;lipped a &s;hilling into my hand. As I had never to the be&s;t of my re|collection, &s;een him before, I was &s;omewhat &s;urpri|zed at his genero&s;ity; but fortunately had the pre|&s;ence of mind to a&s;k him whether he had charged his fruit the higher on account of this pre&s;ent to me. "Why young man," &s;aid he, "that is an hone&s;t que&s;|tion, and I will give you an hone&s;t an&s;wer. The fact is, that as we know that gentlemen of your cloth expect &s;ome complement from the trade&s;men they deal with, we are obliged in our own defence, to charge our articles the higher on that account to their ma&s;|ters." "And &s;o," &s;aid I, "the money you give us, comes finally from the pockets of our ma&s;ters?"&mdash;
<PB N="14" REF="035296_0108_1001BFB1A9CD08D8">To be &s;ure it does." "Why then," &s;aid I, "I will take your &s;hilling, but &s;hall charge my ma&s;ter only nine &s;hillings." And this method I con&s;tantly pur|&s;ued in the like ca&s;e ever after; for I think the above mentioned practice of footmen, which, however, I hope is not very common with them, is ju&s;t the &s;ame thing in con&s;cience as if they &s;hould rob their ma&s;|ter's bureau.</P>
<P>One Monday morning, having &s;ettled my account for the la&s;t week with my ma&s;ter, I found that he had made a mi&s;take again&s;t him&s;elf of twenty &s;hillings. As &s;oon as I di&s;covered it, I &s;aid to my&s;elf, here now is an opportunity of getting twenty &s;hillings without any ri&s;k of detection: but God forbid that I &s;hould do it, as it would ruin my peace of mind, &amp; de&s;troy my &s;oul. I therefore pointed out the error to my ma&s;ter the fir&s;t opportunity. "Charles," &s;aid he, "you are right, the mi&s;take is obvious, I acknowledge I made it purpo&s;ely to try your hone&s;ty. You &s;hall find that this affair will turn out, before long, to your advan|tage." Now, though I do not think it quite fair for ma&s;ters to lay this kind of trap for their &s;ervants' in|tegrity, yet as I know by experience they &s;ometimes do it, we mu&s;t be doubly on our guard. Indeed di&s;hon|e&s;ty is never &s;afe; it always will out &s;omehow or o|ther. I have &s;een &s;urpri&s;ing in&s;tances of the di&s;cov|ery of it, when it, &s;eemed to have been com|mitted with &s;uch cunning as to be impo&s;&s;ible to be detected. One day, as I was going to market, I met Sir Robert S's butler, who told me, that having long ob&s;erved my &s;obreity and diligence, he was hap|py to have it now in his power to offer me a place in his ma&s;ter's family where my wages &s;hould be rai&s;ed two guineas a year. I thanked him, and told him he &s;hould have his an&s;wer next evening. In the mean time, I called upon a pious and worthy friend, whom I con&s;ulted in all difficulties, and a&s;ked his o|pinion.
<PB N="15" REF="035296_0109_1001BFB713D1F1B0">After mature deliberation, he &s;aid, "Charles don't go. When you are once got into a good place, &s;tick to it like a le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">h. The rolling &s;tone gets no mo&s;s. The more years you continue in one &s;ervice, the more you are re&s;pected by your ma&s;ter and all the world. A good, family con&s;iders an old &s;ervant as one of them|&s;elves, and can no more &s;ee him want than a near rela|tion. Whereas &s;ervants that are continually roving from place to place, have no friend in di&s;tre&s;s, and &s;el|dom get a provi&s;ion for old age." Happy it was for me that I followed this good advice. If I had not I &s;hould probably been nothing more than a poor footman all my life.</P>
<P>But before I bring my own &s;tory to an end, I mu&s;t beg my reader's patience, to li&s;ten to the &s;ad fate of my poor brother Tom. Alas! poor Tom, he was a great favorite in our kitchen, becau&s;e he &s;ung the be&s;t &s;ong, and told the merrie&s;t tale, and paid his card money the mo&s;t f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ly of any gentleman footman about town. And then he &s;wore &s;o much like a gentleman, and was &s;o com|plai&s;ant to the ladies, and pu&s;hed about the &s;trong beer &s;o merrily that he was, &s;aid our &s;ervants, the mo&s;t argee|able company in the world. And yet all tho&s;e enter-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ning qualities did not pre&s;erve my poor brother from the mo&s;t di&s;tre&s;sful &s;tate of di&s;tre&s;s and ruin. One mor|ning he came to me about ten o'clock with a very woe|ful face, which was a thing very unu&s;ual for him, and told me that he had ju&s;t been turned away from his place without a character, and that he had no money, many debts, and no real friends, and what was wor&s;e than all, that he was laboring under di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>Tom grew wor&s;e every day, and was at length given over. In the morning of that day, while I was &s;itting at his bed-&s;ide, who &s;hould come in but my dear mother. She had walked 130 miles, except now and then a li&s;t in the waggon, to attend upon &amp; comfort her unde&s;erving &s;on. When &s;he &s;aw him, pale and emaciated, and his
<PB N="16" REF="035296_0110_1001BFB8B2C26E38">face half con&s;umed by di&s;ea&s;e, it &s;o &s;hocked her that &s;he &s;ainted away. As &s;oon as &s;he recovered, and was a little relieved by a plentiful flood of tears, &s;he &s;aid, "my dear Tom, I am come to take care of thee, and make thee better if I can." "Alas! mother," an&s;wered he, putting his clay-cold hand into her's, "it is all too late. I have but a few hours to live. It is by neglecting your advice that I am brought to this. Gaming and drink, and bad company, and bad women, have been my ruin. O! what will become of my &s;oul! If I could but live my life over again." Here he was &s;eized with a &s;udden fit, and though he lived &s;ome hours, he never &s;poke after, and died that evening in my mother's arms.</P>
<P>After recounting the &s;orrowful hi&s;tory of my unhappy brother, I mu&s;t now ha&s;ten to conclude my own. A|bout a twelvemonth after the offer of a place in Sir Ro|bert S&mdash;'s family, my ma&s;ter, in con&s;ideration, as he &s;aid, of my faithful &s;ervices, made me his butler. He was indeed &s;o kind and friendly to me on all occa&s;ions, that I found it nece&s;&s;ary to be extremely cautious le&s;t I &s;hould grow proud, or &s;aucy, or familiar, which &s;ome &s;ervants, when they live long in a place, and find them|&s;elves in favor, are apt to do. After enjoying this po&s;t about &s;ix years, our family being now removed into the country, I made acquaintance with a farmer's daugh|ter living near the great hou&s;e, whom, on account of her religious and indu&s;trious principles, and her amia|ble and cheerful temper, I wi&s;hed to make my wife. She was no flaunter in fine cloaths, none of your dancing, flirting, forward la&s;&s;es, that run about to chri&s;tenings, and revels, and hops, that will ruin a man before he knows where he is; but a pious, &s;ober, &s;tay-at-home, indu&s;trious young woman; el&s;e I am &s;ure any body might have had her for me. As I had never been guil|ty of any unnece&s;&s;ary expen&s;e, for nobody will call that unnece&s;&s;ary which I &s;ent yearly to my parents, my &s;ay|ings, the intere&s;t being added yearly to the principal in
<PB N="17" REF="035296_0111_1001BFBB39AB8CC0">the hands of my ma&s;ter, amounted to 200 pounds. And as Fanny's father promi&s;ed to give her another hundred, I thought we might with this take a &s;mall farm, and maintain our&s;elves comfortably and decently. I therefore communicated the affair to my ma&s;ter.&mdash; "Charles," &s;aid he, "though I am loth to part with &s;o good a &s;ervant, yet I think it an act of gratitude due to you for your long and faithful &s;ervices, to con&s;ent to a|ny thing which may be for your welfare. But I do not think it nece&s;&s;ary to part at all. I am at pre&s;ent in want of a bailiff. You may, if you approve it, undertake that office and &s;till retain your pre&s;ent wages. Your father-in-law, who is an experienced farmer, will in&s;truct and a&s;&s;i&s;t you in the duties of it. I will, be&s;ides, let you a &s;mall farm on an advantageous lea&s;e, which you may make the mo&s;t of for your&s;elf.</P>
<P>To this kind and generous offer I joyfully a&s;&s;ented. And Fanny and my&s;elf have now lived together &s;ix years in the farm-hou&s;e, near the park-gate, happy and pro&s;perous. My father being dead, and my brother and &s;i&s;ter &s;ettled, my mother, who is now very old, lives with me, and by her example and exhortation, I find a &s;en&s;e or religion &s;ink deeper and deeper into my &s;oul everyday; and, indeed, I am firmly convinced by long experience, that there is nothing in this world can make us truly happy but that.</P>
<P>I addre&s;s this little book, which I wrote by little and little in the long evenings of the la&s;t hard winter, to all footmen. I hope they will not be angry with my well-meant endeavours, but take kindly what is intend|ed only for their good.</P>

<P>ATTEND, ye young men, who are about to enter into trade, for to you I write my &s;tory. I was bound apprentice to a re&s;pectable trad&s;eman in Cheap|&s;ide. My ma&s;ter, Mr. Vincent, had acquired <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">very f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">r character, whil&s;t he was making a comfortable for|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ne. His wi&s;e was a dre&s;&s;y, fla&s;hy woman, who liked vi&s;iting and jaunting more than taking care of her family, whil&s;t my ma&s;ter was plodding late at night in the compt|ing hou&s;e, Mrs. Vincent and her daughters were either making parties abroad, or giving entertainments at home. As we kept no footman, I was allowed when the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">hop was &s;hut, to run from one public place to another to call a coach, to bring Mrs. Vincent and her daugh|ters home. To lounging about the purlieus of a play|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">&s;e I owe my ruin. I was generally allowed to be a hand&s;ome well-made young man; this unfortunately <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ew upon me the notice of a &s;et of tho&s;e wretched wo|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">n, who nightly croud the theatres; I &s;hould have been delighted with the notice they took of me, had not my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">ty whi&s;pered me that Mi&s;s Vincent was in love with me. This &s;u&s;picion was &s;ully confirmed to me by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Porter, an elder apprentice, but for who&s;e wicked <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> I might have lived happily, and died virtuou&s;tly.</P>
<P>The idea that Mi&s;s Vincent was in love with me at once completed me for the coxcomb: I now neglected my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">e&s;s, and to dre&s;s out my per&s;on became the on|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> object of my thoughts: I began to commit little frauds on my ma&s;ter, in order to obtain money to dre&s;s <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">; for ever &s;ince Potter had laughed me out of my religion every principle of moral hone&s;ty &s;at loo&s;ely up|on me.</P>

We young me indeed were &s;ent to church; but as we had no examples &s;et us by the heads of the family going thither them&s;elves, Potter and I generally hired a gig and da&s;hed away from one tea-drinking place to another; the&s;e &s;cenes &s;oon made me lo&s;e all re&s;pect for virtue and religion. It was at the Dog and Duck I fir&s;t &s;aw the infamous Mi&s;s We&s;t; &s;he was many years older than my&s;elf: her per&s;on was as love|ly as her heart was wicked. She was no &s;ooner infor|med that I was to come into po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of 3000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> the day I came of age, than &s;he made u&s;e of all her deceitful arts to en&s;nare both my &s;oul and body, as &s;he often promp|ted me to defraud my ma&s;ter to &s;upply her extrava|gance. My attachment to Mi&s;s Vincent was now on 01 the decline, for Mi&s;s We&s;t had &s;o far wrought upon my vanity, as to make me belive that &s;o hand&s;ome a young fellow as I was, &s;hould look higher than a trade&s;man's daughter, from that moment I treated Mi&s;s Vincent with the mo&s;t marked neglect, although I &s;aw my conduct cut her to the heart; yet, at the &s;ame time was I ba&s;e enough to borrow money of her, which I wantonly &s;quandered away on Mi&s;s We&s;t.</P>
<P>When Potter's apprentice&s;hip expired, in&s;tead of im|proving his fortune by throwing it into trade, he plung|ed at once into all the vices of the town. He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a plau&s;ible kind of prate, which cau&s;ed him to be ap|pointed Chairman to our Club, which was chiefly com|po&s;ed of clerks and apprentice boys. Potter's principal excellence con&s;i&s;ted in &s;inging a merry &s;ong, telling an indecent &s;tory, and teaching his heaters to laugh at mo|rality, and &s;et all religion at defiance; &s;er religion, he maintained, was only an old woman's tale, invented by cunning heads to keep children and fools in order.</P>
<P>There was an hone&s;t old porter lived in our family,
<PB N="20" REF="035296_0114_1001BFC626671DA0">who for &s;ome time had &s;et him&s;elf to watch my conduct, and at length he made &s;uch a faithful report of it to my ma&s;ter, that he gave up my indentures, and turned me out of doors.</P>
<P>I was too much delighted with my liberty to feel any &s;en&s;e of &s;hame at the means by which I obtained it.</P>
<P>I was &s;orry, however, to break off entirely with Mi&s;s Vincent, for I &s;till had a lurking affection for her; I told Potter &s;o: his inventive genius &s;oon laid a plan whereby I might get her into my power, and take a complete revenge on her whole family at the &s;ame time. This was by writing her a letter, &s;etting forth the vio|lence of my love, the unmerited di&s;grace I had received from her family, and at the &s;ame time reque&s;ting her to grant me a private meeting, in order that I might ju&s;|tify my conduct to her, as otherwi&s;e I feared the vio|lence of my pa&s;&s;ion would drive me to a fit of de&s;pair.</P>
<P>This poor imprudent girl met me at the time and place appointed. I will not here &s;hock my readers with rela|ting the vile &s;tratagems I made u&s;e of to complete the ruin of this young lady, nor the tremendous oaths I &s;wore to repair her wrongs by marriage, as &s;oon as I came of age, which would be in a very few months; this &s;omewhat abated her &s;orrow for the very indi&s;creet &s;tep &s;he had taken.</P>
<P>The day I became of age, I went down into the coun|try. My friends having been apprized of my profligate life, received me very coldly. I practi&s;ed the deepe&s;t hypocri&s;y on my good mother, to make her believe I was quite a reformed man, in order to wheedle her out of a &s;um of money, telling her at the &s;ame time, I had an im|mediate pro&s;pect of entering into a very profitable con|cern with a partner of great re&s;pon&s;ibility, if I could but increa&s;e my capital.</P>
<P>"Frank," &s;aid &s;he, with firmne&s;s, "there is no tru&s;|ting to your promi&s;es; as long as your conduct de&s;erved my love, you ever &s;ound me an indulgent mother; but you &s;hall never have cau&s;e to &s;ay, I acted towards you
<PB N="21" REF="035296_0115_1001BFC88AF4E6B0">like a weak woman, by robbing my virtuous children, to &s;upply the wanton extravagance of a profligate &s;on.&mdash;Your wicked life, Frank, has nearly broken my heart, but it &s;hall not &s;hake my ju&s;tice." The well known &s;teadine&s;s of my mother's temper convinced me at once &s;he was not further to be impo&s;ed upon by the fallacy of my arguments.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as I had &s;ettled my bu&s;ine&s;s, I returned to London to Mi&s;s Vincent, who had waited for me with the utmo&s;t patience, fully expecting I was come to ful|fil my promi&s;e of marriage to her. "I can &s;truggle with want, dear Frank," &s;aid &s;he, "but I will never con&s;ent to live in &s;hame." Nothing I am certain hardens the heart like vice, for although this poor young creature was brought into a very trying &s;ituation by the pro&s;pect of her &s;oon becoming a mother, I &s;wore I would never make <HI>her</HI> my <HI>wife,</HI> who had di&s;graced her&s;elf by living with me as a <HI>mistress.</HI> On hearing this, in all the ten|der agonies of grief, &s;he urged me to repair the wrongs I had done her, reminding me at the &s;ame time, of the wicked arts I had made u&s;e of to beguile her of her innocence, and then with cla&s;ped hands and &s;treaming eyes, &s;he threw her&s;elf on her knees before me, be&s;eech|ing me to pity the agonies which rent her &s;oul, yet &s;till my hardened nature was untouched by her &s;orrow; again I &s;olemnly &s;wore I never would marry her.</P>
<P>Through exce&s;s of grief &s;he fainted away, in which pitiable &s;tate I left her to the care of a &s;ervant, went out and &s;pent the re&s;t of the evening with Mi&s;s We&s;t, who&s;e flinty heart turned into ridicule the &s;orrowful tale I related to her.</P>
<P>On returning to my lodgings the next morning, I was informed Mi&s;s Vincent had left them without leaving behind her the lea&s;t information where &s;he was to be found, and much did I rejoice when I heard it, that &s;he had taken her&s;elf off &s;o quietly.</P>
<P>I now lavi&s;hed my money as though it would never have an end. By all I was e&s;teemed the mo&s;t noble &s;pi|rited
<PB N="22" REF="035296_0116_1001BFCEDF7957B0">fellow in the world, and even little wits would be &s;ilent in my pre&s;ence, becau&s;e I was &s;ure to pay for the wine upon which they were to riot. My ca&s;h at length beginning to run low, as I had been all along drawing from the principal, I advi&s;ed with Potter how to get furni&s;hed with future &s;upplies. He advi&s;ed the gaming table as a never failing friend, &s;aying, it had long &s;ince been the only re&s;ource from whence he derived his &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence.</P>
<P>I took his advice and for &s;ome months was &s;o &s;ucce&s;&s;|ful, that I began to da&s;h away in higher life at the We&s;t end of the town.&mdash;I bought an elegant phaeton, which I drove every Sunday in Hyde Park, with Mi&s;s We&s;t by my &s;ide. One day as I was driving furiou&s;ly through Temple Bar, I had the misfortune to overturn a poor man with a heavy load on his back; on his get|ting up, I perceived him to be Mr. Vincent's old por|ter, to whom I formerly owed my di&s;grace.</P>
<P>"Ah! ah! what, is it you young hopeful?" cried he, on &s;eeing to whom he owed his misfortune, "well, he mu&s;t needs go whom the devil drives; thy prancing nags may die a natural death, ma&s;ter Frank, but veri|ly, I think 'tis more than thou wilt, boy, for if thou die&s;t in thy &s;hoes, the gallows will be robbed of its due. What is become of poor Patty Vincent, thou profli|gate dog, ha&s;t thou broken her heart, as thou ha&s;t that of her poor afflicted parents!"</P>
<P>The &s;udden recollection of that unfortunate girl cau|&s;ed &s;uch a &s;wimming in my head, that the reins dropt from my hands, my hor&s;es took fright, and it was al|mo&s;t a miracle that I get home alive.&mdash;The porter's words had made &s;uch an impre&s;&s;ion on my mind that I could not &s;hake them off. Soon after, Potter calling upon me, I told him of my interview with the old por|ter, and al&s;o the effect it had on me. "Frank," &s;aid he, "if a fellow of thy &s;pirit can be thus ea&s;ily over|come by qualms of con&s;cience, let us in&s;tantly adjourn to the tavern, &s;ince good wine is the be&s;t remedy in the
<PB N="23" REF="035296_0117_1001BFD427033690">world to drown all unea&s;y recollections in." I gladly accepted his propo&s;al: we called a coach, and off we went. He no &s;ooner &s;aw my &s;pirits inflamed with wine, than he drew me to the gaming table, where, before morning, I lo&s;t every &s;hilling I had in the world; I ap|plied to Potter to lend me 50 guineas, as he had won more than 200 of me.</P>
<P>Laughing heartily, he told me, it had ever been a maxim with him, never to lend his money to a man who had not prudence to keep his own; "but, harkee, Frank," &s;aid he, "I'll give thee my be&s;t advice gratis: &s;uch a noble &s;pirited young fellow as thou art, needs ne|ver be at a lo&s;s for money while he can &s;nap a trigger, and the highway is left open for him to practi&s;e upon. Men who follow the &s;ame cour&s;e of plea&s;ure, are the la&s;t people in the world to help each other in the hour of di&s;tre&s;s; virtuous men, Frank, only feel for the wants of their friends, and they alone find plea&s;ure in reliev|ing them." He then whi&s;tled him&s;elf off.</P>
<P>When I got home, I &s;at revolving in my mind how to get my&s;elf out of my pre&s;ent difficulties, when in a fatal moment, Satan whi&s;pered in my ears the word FORGERY. At fir&s;t I &s;tarted at the thought, but my poverty was clamorous, my pride &s;tartled at di&s;grace, although my con&s;cience did not &s;hudder at the crime. I know I could copy Mr. Vincent's hand exactly, I &s;natched up the pen to draw a bill upon him for 500 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> but a cold &s;hivering &s;eizing me, it dropt from my fin|gers, a &s;trong &s;en&s;e of my guilt now overtook me, I tore what I had written to pieces, and exclaimed, I am a free man again; and for a moment felt thankful that I had been enabled to re&s;i&s;t the violence of temptation. I &s;at pondering, however, how I &s;hould maintain my&s;elf; again I was a&s;&s;aulted with the dread of poverty, and again I &s;natched up the pen, drew the fatal bill, and in|&s;tantly went and got it accepted.</P>
<P>But the moment I &s;ought to take re&s;t at night on my pillow, I felt as if all the horrors of hell had &s;eized me.
<PB N="24" REF="035296_0118_1001BFD865F56070">I jumped out of bed in my &s;leep, and was going to throw my&s;elf out of the window, having dreamt that I was apprehended, the people of the hou&s;e, awakened by my cries, ran into the room, concluding &s;ome villains had broken in, and were going to murder me.</P>
<P>I never afterwards went into the &s;treet, but my fears told me I was the &s;ubject of conver&s;ation of all the peo|ple I met. Once I happened to hear one man &s;ay to another, pointing to a third, "that's he, that's he," I took to my heels, concluding that I my&s;elf was meant, and ran from one &s;treet to another, without knowing whither, till my &s;ight failed me, and, through lo&s;s of breath, I dropped down in a fit. Some humane people however, recovered me, and put me into a hackney coach which carried me home.</P>
<P>One day, a &s;udden gu&s;t of wind blew open my cham|ber door, again I concluded the officers were coming to take me. Snatching up the poker to defend my&s;elf, I &s;wore I would not be taken alive, when turning about &s;uddenly, I caught a glimp&s;e of my&s;elf in the gla&s;s, my eyes looked wild, my lips quivered, my jaws dropped, my teeth chattered, and my body &s;hook, as though the la&s;t agonies of death were upon me. On finding I was once more become the dupe of my fears, my &s;pirits ral|lied again, I dre&s;&s;ed and went to the play; there I met Sally We&s;t, whom I had not &s;een for &s;ome weeks; for, to &s;ay the truth, I dreaded to meet an old acquaintance from the time I committed the forgery: after the play, we went off together to &s;up at a tavern&punc; we had not been there a quarter of an hour when &s;he made an ex|cu&s;e for quitting the room; in about ten minutes &s;he returned to me, expre&s;&s;ing in the tendere&s;t terms the &s;atisfaction &s;he had to &s;ee me again.</P>
<P>We were, as I believed, ju&s;t going to &s;et down to &s;upper, when the waiters came in followed by two of Sir John Fielding's men. Immediately with the great|e&s;t coolne&s;s, Mi&s;s We&s;t aro&s;e, and laying her hand on my &s;houlder exclaimed, "the Phili&s;tines be upon thee
<PB N="25" REF="035296_0119_1001BFE12B7FB630">Samp&s;on. Gentlemen," continued &s;he to the officers, "this is my good friend Mr. Francis H&mdash;of whom you have been &s;ometime in &s;earch. Perhaps, Frank," continued &s;he, "you do not know that your forgery is di&s;covered, and that 100 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> reward is offered for taking you, when I left the room ju&s;t now it was to write a note to the&s;e gentlemen, &s;ignifying to them where you were to be found; I &s;ee you are terrified, but hear me for the la&s;t time perhaps, and you will the le&s;s wonder at my conduct. Early in life, Frank, I was betrayed to ruin, by a ba&s;e de&s;igning man; my reputation once bla&s;ted, I was de&s;erted by all the virtuous part of my own &s;ex; by having had examples always before my eyes, I &s;oon became hardened in &s;in and abandoned to &s;hame. I have lately contracted debts; if they are not immediately di&s;charged I &s;hall be &s;ent to a jail; this jail I know not how to avoid but by &s;ending you thither in my &s;tead; as the reward offered for taking you will ju&s;t &s;et me free from my creditors."</P>
<P>I was &s;truck motionle&s;s with terror, and fainted away on the officers approaching to tie my hands behind me; nor had I the lea&s;t recollection of what pa&s;&s;ed, till I found my&s;elf &s;afe locked in my pri&s;on. About a week after this, the keeper came to tell me, there was a pri|&s;oner lately brought in who was very de&s;irous of &s;eeing me, and as &s;he appeared an object of great pity, he offer|ed to conduct me to her. On entering the chamber, I &s;aw a young woman very &s;habbily dre&s;&s;ed, lying on a mi&s;erable bed, in a very weak condition.</P>
<P>"Do&s;t thou not know me, Frank?" &s;aid &s;he, in a hol|low broken voice. Ha&s;t thou lo&s;t all recollection of Patty Vincent." I felt in&s;tantly as if &s;truck with a thunderbolt. "Merciful Heaven!" cried I, falling on my knees by the bed&s;ide; "I am unable to bear the puni&s;hment my crimes have brought upon me! O God of mercy &s;upport my troubled &s;oul." She kindly urged me to be comforted, &s;aid &s;he wi&s;hed not to &s;ee me to re|proach me for the evils I had brought upon her, but on|ly
<PB N="26" REF="035296_0120_1001BFE582F051C0">to tell me with her la&s;t breath that &s;he forgave me.&mdash;"It is not an hour &s;ince, Frank," continued &s;he, "that I heard you was my fellow-pri&s;oner, and what is wor&s;e at my father's &s;uit. I will not reproach you, Frank, I tell you again, for all the mi&s;eries you have brought up|on me, becau&s;e you are a pri&s;oner and in chains. If my breath will hold out, I will endeavor to give you a &s;hort hi&s;tory of my&s;elf &s;ince we parted. On your refu|&s;ing to make me your lawful wife, I quitted your lodg|ings, re&s;olving by my labor to eat the bread of indu&s;try rather than follow a cour&s;e of vice for a wretched &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence. I hired a garret in Holborn, where I applied for needle-work, and &s;oon obtained it. In about three months after our &s;eparation, my infant came into the world, I &s;old my cloaths for my &s;upport during my con|finement, but that re&s;ource &s;oon failed me. My health and &s;trength declined, I was &s;eized with a con&s;tant fe|ver and cough, and quite unable to &s;upply the &s;canty mor&s;el of bread for the day, yet re&s;olved to die rather than afflict my dear parents with the knowledge of my mi&s;ery. At length being too weak to labor, I contract|ed &s;everal &s;mall debts, for which I was &s;eized and brought hither. I have however &s;ince been prevailed upon to &s;end my poor half-furni&s;hed baby to my parents, hoping they will afford her that bread which her dying mother dared not a&s;k for her&s;elf." Ob&s;erving I was &s;peechle&s;s with agony, poor Patty went on. "I did not wi&s;h to &s;ee you, Frank, to afflict you, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">i&s;h only to warn you with my dying breath to repe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t the evil of your ways, and humble your &s;oul before God.

<P>Here &s;he was interrupted by the unexpected entrance of Mr. and Mrs. Vincent. O ye, who &s;hall hereafter read my &s;tory, drop a tear of pity at the agony I now endured! They no &s;ooner beheld their child, than each by turns tenderly embraced her, a&s;&s;uring her of their forgivene&s;s, and gently chid her, for having concealed her&s;elf &s;o long, adding, that as a penitent child they would mo&s;t gladly have received her, though they would have &s;hunned her, if they found her living in pro&s;perous wickedne&s;s. She thanked them and &s;aid,</P>
<P>"Mourn not for my death, my deare&s;t parents, but rather rejoice that I die penitent for my tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, and &s;ince I have received your ble&s;&s;ing and forgivene&s;s I have but one favor more to a&s;k in life, which is, that you, my kind father, will extend your pity towards that young man," pointing to me. "O &s;ave him, if po&s;&s;ible, from an ignominious death, and remember, that my child is al&s;o his. My bu&s;ine&s;s in life is done, and now, O Heavenly Father! receive my &s;pirit, and pardon my &s;in, through Je&s;us Chri&s;t my Redeemer." Here her &s;peech failed her, and after a few convul&s;ive &s;truggles &s;he expired.</P>
<P>Great Heaven! is there any puni&s;hment for me to &s;uffer hereafter beyond what I endured at the mo|ment? A dead &s;ilence &s;ucceeded for &s;ome time, my groans only were heard. As &s;oon as Mr. Vincent had &s;omewhat recovered the &s;hock, he rai&s;ed him&s;elf from the body of his child, and &s;poke to me as follows:</P>
<P>"Behold, O young man, the calamities which thy crimes have brought on my family! Behold, my depart|ed child lying on the bo&s;om of her fainting mother; yet I am not in&s;en&s;ible to the agonies which rend thy &s;oul, and &s;orry am I to add to them, by telling thee, thy ex|cellent mother went out of her &s;en&s;es, on hoaring thou had&s;t committed a crime, by which thou had&s;t forfeited
<PB N="28" REF="035296_0122_1001BFEAB52CEE28">thy life to the laws of thy country. O Frank! Frank! what deep di&s;tre&s;s can one profligate child bring on whole families! Thy crimes, alas! have brought on thy own de&s;truction, for I fear it will not be in my power to be|friend thee on thy trial, much as I am di&s;po&s;ed to do it in con&s;ideration of thy relations. Too late, Frank, thou mu&s;t now &s;ee, how fatal an exce&s;&s;ive love of plea|&s;ure mu&s;t prove to a young trade&s;man. Hone&s;t indu&s;try is generally a &s;ure road to wealth; as a &s;ober, religious life is to happine&s;s. To thy co&s;t thou mu&s;t already have experienced, that the wicked can have no depen|dence upon each other, &s;ince thou art betrayed and brought to &s;hame, by tho&s;e very friends who fir&s;t led thy youth a&s;tray."</P>
<P>"O Sir," cried I, "few and evil have been my days, but the great God above, who knoweth the &s;ecrets of all hearts, can alone judge of the &s;orrows of mine; it is not, Sir, the puni&s;hment of death which I fear, but the ju&s;t vengeance of offended Heaven, which mu&s;t follow it; for though a very young man, I am a very old &s;in|ner. Alas! my dear, and honored mother, is it then true, that the crimes of your own child have robbed you of your &s;en&s;es? And yet the merciful hand of God has hitherto withheld his vengeance from &s;triking me dead. To whom &s;hall I fly for mercy and pity in my di&s;tre&s;s? From the law I cannot expect it, and from the offended Maje&s;ty of high Heaven I dare not hope it, &s;ince my pre&s;ent puni&s;hment is but the certain wages of my &s;in." Here I am told I fell into &s;trong convul|&s;ion fits, and in that condition was conveyed to my cell.</P>
<P><HI>Written the night before my execution.</HI></P>
<P>It is a month &s;ince I was put on my trial, and my guilt being fully proved by the court, I am condemned to hang by the neck till I am <HI>Dead! Dead! Dead!</HI></P>
<P>O, ye thoughtle&s;s young men who have for&s;aken the God of Heaven to follow after the enticing plea&s;ures of
<PB N="29" REF="035296_0123_1001A30AD9103E98">this world, attend to my words, as to tho&s;e of a man &s;peaking to you from the grave, &s;ince the dawn of that day is now breaking on the world, in which I &s;hall be numbered with the dead. Although, at the in&s;tant I write, I am in all the prime of youth, and all the vigor of health, I &s;hall this day die a ju&s;t victim to the broken laws; and my precious &s;oul may be con&s;igned over to everla&s;ting torments, unle&s;s the great judge of all things will be graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to accept my &s;orrow for my &s;in, through a gracious Redeemer.</P>
<P>My days are numbered, my hours are few, and the &s;olemn tolling bell will &s;oon be &s;ummoning me to meet my God in judgment. The convul&s;ive &s;truggles of death are already upon me before I reach the gallows, whereon I mu&s;t &s;hortly hang as a warning &s;pectacle to gaping thou&s;ands, and from whence I mu&s;t &s;hoot the great gulph which parts TIME from ETERNITY!</P>
<P>O, ble&s;&s;ed Lord, have mercy on my &s;oul!</P>

<HEAD>THE STORY OF POOR TRICKET, THE <HI>GAMESTER.</HI></HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Slewing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ow he fir&s;t lo&s;t his place by gaming, and then had well nigh been the death of his wife through the &s;ame cau&s;e, and how, la&s;tly, his gaming was the occa&s;ion of his being tran&s;ported as a convict to Bota|ny Bay.</HEAD>
<P>"I CAN'T, for my life, imagine (&s;aid Mr. Smith to his oppo&s;ite neighbor, Mr. Tom&s;on) what tho&s;e fellows can be about on the top of my hou&s;e.&mdash;They have been the&s;e two days employed there in re|pairing the damage done by the high wind t'other night; a job which I think might have been done in a very few hours." Step over the way to my door," &s;aid Tom&s;on "and I will pre&s;ently explain to you why the job is &s;o long in hand." Smith did &s;o&mdash;" turn about and look up," &s;aid Tom&s;on, "and you will &s;ee the two men &s;itting over again&s;t each other on the ridge of your hou&s;e."&mdash;"Why they are playing at cards!" &s;aid Smith&mdash;"no wonder my bu&s;ine&s;s is &s;o long in doing." Away went Smith to the ma&s;ter bricklayer to com|plain of his men. The ma&s;ter was very angry, as he well might be, and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the idle fellows from his &s;ervice; and as he made known the &s;tory, the men found no one willing to employ them, &s;o they had full lei&s;ure for their gaming, and Bet&s;worth lo&s;t all his money with Tricket&mdash;Bet&s;worth's wife in vain a&s;ked him for ca&s;h, provi&s;ions were &s;carce, and they had lived on &s;hort commons &s;everal days.</P>
<P>On Saturday Bet&s;worth had no wages to receive, never|thele&s;s,
<PB N="31" REF="035296_0125_1001BFF2563AFE88">he de&s;ired his wife would get a bit of meat for a hot Sunday's dinner; "for" &s;aid he, "we have lived hardly enough this week, and I &s;hall a&s;k my friend Tricket to eat a bit with us." The wife &s;aid nothing, but when her hu&s;band and Tricket came in to dinner on Sunday, &s;he laid the cloth, and &s;et upon the table a di&s;h with a cover. "What ha&s;t thou got under thy co|ver, wife?" &s;aid Bet&s;worth, "&s;omething nice I hope." "As good as I could get," &s;aid the wife, "had you brought me money you &s;hould have had &s;omething bet|ter." Upon this he lifted up the cover and behold! the di&s;h contained nothing but &s;ome dirty old cards &s;catter|ed about it! "Is this," &s;aid Bet&s;worth, "what you pro|vide for me and my friend?" "It is all that you and your friend have left us," &s;aid &s;he; "I have nothing to eat my&s;elf, and the&s;e are the only tools you work with to provide for my maintenance and your own." "Bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n the cards," &s;aid Bet&s;worth, "they have been the ruin of me: forgive me wife, I de&s;erve a more bitter reproof." "Tricket," added he, "my poor Molly has &s;erved us rightly enough; for my part, I am re&s;olved to go to my ma&s;ter to-morrow, confe&s;s my fault, and try to get his work again; and I hope God will pardon me for the di&s;tre&s;s I have brought upon my family by my love of gaming; and that he will mercifully &s;trengthen me to re&s;i&s;t every temptation to return to &s;uch a horrid practice."&mdash;Tricket did not reli&s;h the je&s;t, but went &s;urlily out of the hou&s;e. Bet&s;worth, however, is &s;aid to have taken a hint from this little trick of his wife, and, as far as I have heard, he has never &s;ince been found among&s;t the Game&s;ters.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t now proceed to tell you &s;omething more of Tricket, who continued his evil practices, and who is the only one of the&s;e two Game&s;ters who&s;e hi&s;tory I mean to &s;peak of any farther.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="035296_0126_1001BFF965D30F48">
Having lo&s;t his former gull whom he tried once or twice to draw into another game, by &s;aying that the man wanted &s;pirit, Tricket happened to light upon a &s;econd brother game&s;ter, whom he hoped to drain as he had done Bet&s;worth; but either through a &s;ad run of ill-luck, or, as I rather think, by his being not a lit|tle cheated, he &s;oon lo&s;t every farthing of his former boo|ty, and he had nothing now left for him to &s;take at the next gaming party, except what little he could get by &s;tripping his poor wife of the earnings of her hard la|bor.&mdash;She had two children of four and five years of age, for whom, as well as her&s;elf, &s;he contri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed to get bread by taking in wa&s;hing.</P>
<P>She bore with patience her hu&s;band's &s;pending all he got upon his own plea&s;ures, and leaving her to &s;hift for her&s;elf; but when he came home and tore from her what &s;he had worked &s;o hard for, &s;he could not help weeping and complaining, though her complaints were mild and far from the language of &s;colding; but her brutal hu&s;|band, in&s;tead of being moved by her tears, only made them a pretence for running from her to the ale-hou&s;e; "&s;ince," as he &s;aid, "he could not have comfort at home."</P>
<P>One of the families for which &s;he wa&s;hed would of|ten carele&s;sly make her wait a month or two for the payment of her bills, in&s;tead of di&s;charging them week|ly, when &s;he brought home the linen. This is a cruel incon&s;ideratency, and very contrary to the merciful &s;pi|rit of the law of God, which forbids to keep back the hire of the laborer. The truth is, per&s;ons who&s;e only &s;upport is hard labor, can &s;eldom do more than live from hand to mouth, and whil&s;t their pay is kept back by a thoughtle&s;s cu&s;tomer, they are likely enough to be &s;tarving for the want of it.</P>
<P>It happened that &s;he had ju&s;t received a wa&s;hing bill of &s;ix weeks &s;tanding, which &s;he had long been &s;ighing
<PB N="33" REF="035296_0127_1001A31AF9D5C170">for, and was counting her money, when her hu&s;band came home in a terrible humour, declared he had not a farthing in the world, and laid his violent hands on this money, every &s;hilling of which he carried off.&mdash;She &s;creamed after him, begging that he would leave her &s;ome of it at lea&s;t, or how could &s;he get bread for her children? But he was quickly out of hearing, and ha&s;tily returned to his play-mate, who waited for him at the ale-hou&s;e. Tricket's cruelty &s;truck his wife to the heart; &s;he &s;at down in dumb de&s;pair and could not ea&s;e her full heart by weeping; the children looked up in her face with terror, and &s;oon began to cry, and to tell her they were hungry; this gave a free pa&s;&s;age to her tears; &s;he hugged them both to her brea&s;t, and told them that they &s;hould have all the food their cruel father had left them: &s;he brought out the remainder of her loaf, and divided it between them; for her part, &s;he could &s;wallow none.</P>
<P>By being obliged to tru&s;t her cu&s;tomers, &s;he had been reduced to borrow a little from her landlady, and &s;he owed &s;ome rent be&s;ides, &s;o that &s;he was a&s;hamed to ap|ply to her again, and &s;he had not &s;ix-pence in the world to &s;upply food, or to buy &s;oap for her wa&s;hing. He who &s;hould a&s;&s;i&s;t her was her wor&s;t enemy, and, carele&s;s of her wants, took from her the fruits of her indu&s;try to throw it away in gaming and drinking.</P>
<P>This barbarous treatment hurt her the more becau&s;e, with all his faults, &s;he retained more affection for him than he de&s;erved; and had often cheerfully &s;upplied his extravagance with a &s;hare of what &s;he got, when &s;he could do it without &s;tarving her&s;elf and her children.&mdash;But now provi&s;ions were &s;o dear that &s;he found it not ea&s;y to get nece&s;&s;aries even by working early and late at her laborious bu&s;ine&s;s. No money could &s;he get from her hu&s;band, and this day his antagoni&s;t had refu&s;ed to play with him any longer upon tick; and the alehou&s;e-keeper,
<PB N="34" REF="035296_0128_1001C000499E3FF0">at who&s;e hou&s;e this gaming commonly went on, would draw no more beer without pre&s;ent pay. His character was become &s;o bad, that he could not get em|ployed when nece&s;&s;ity would have urged him to work. In this &s;ituation he had come home de&s;perate and pro|voked at his ill-fortune, when he found his wife with two guineas and a good deal of &s;ilver before her. The &s;ight of this money renewed his hopes, and his eager|ne&s;s for trying once more to recover his lo&s;ings. With this only object in view, he flew like a vulture on his prey, and without a thought of the di&s;tre&s;sful &s;tate of tho&s;e who &s;hould have been dear to him as his life, &s;natched from them all the means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. Thus does gaming harden the heart and &s;wallow up every good affection! whil&s;t the hateful pa&s;&s;ions of avarice and envy are continually fed and &s;trengthened by it!</P>
<P>Poor Mrs. Tricket, cold and fa&s;ting, put her chil|dren to bed and, &s;at weeping over them whil&s;t her hu&s;band &s;pent his hours in greedy wi&s;hes, hopes, and fears; in rage, in oaths, and cur&s;es, over his cards, with the tankard at his &s;ide, often drained by the thir&s;ty pa&s;|&s;ion burning in his &s;tomach, and raging in his mind.&mdash;At pa&s;t midnight he came &s;taggering home, and found his wife &s;itting up for him, pale and &s;hivering, and her face &s;welled with weeping.&mdash;"I thought you had left us for good and all," &s;aid &s;he, "left us to peri&s;h; how could you be &s;o barbarous as to rob me of all, and leave me without a penny in the hou&s;e?&mdash;I be&s;eech you to give me back &s;ome of that money, which was all I had in the world, unle&s;s you do indeed de&s;ire to &s;ee me and your children die with want." "If that was your <HI>all,</HI>" he replied, "<HI>die you must;</HI> for it is every penny gone, and more after it than I &s;hall ever be able to pay." So &s;aying, he turned his pockets in&s;ide out, to &s;hew her they were perfectly empty. At this &s;ight the poor wo|man, who&s;e &s;pirits were before nearly exhau&s;ted with grief and fa&s;ting, fell in a fainting fit at his feet; as he
<PB N="35" REF="035296_0129_1001C0047AA20280">had never &s;een her &s;o before he thought &s;he was dead, and alarmed the hou&s;e with his cries; though he was much in liquor, and his mind almo&s;t di&s;tracted, yet the idea of having been the cau&s;e of her death &s;truck him with horror. The children, awakened by his out-cry, &s;tarted up, and &s;eeing her on the floor, cried, "Mam|my! Mammy!" with all their might.</P>
<P>This dreadful noi&s;e awakened both the landlady, who &s;lept above &s;tairs, and al&s;o a widow lady, who lodged on the fir&s;t floor, but before either of the&s;e could run down &s;tairs, Tricket was at their doors, crying in a hor|rible tone, "My wife! my wife! come to her if you have any pity! I have killed her! help! help!" He then ran back, and found her lying where he had left her, and the two children on the ground with her, ki&s;|&s;ing her cold hands and face, &s;obbing and drowning her with their tears. The lady and landlady reached Trick|et's room at the &s;ame in&s;tant, and looked with amaze|ment on this wretched groupe, whil&s;t the man cried out, "See! &s;ee! what I have done!&mdash;I have murdered my wife!" "Sure you could not be &s;uch a mon&s;ter, &s;aid the lady, "how have you murdered her? where is her wound? help to rai&s;e her up, and let us &s;ee the hurt." They then lifted her up, and perceived returning life in her. "Where is your hurt my poor dear creature?" &s;aid the landlady; "where did that inhuman villain &s;trike you?" The poor woman looked wildly: "what do you mean?" &s;aid &s;he, "he did not &s;trike me, tho' I almo&s;t wi&s;h he had to the heart." Her hu&s;band, now, with the mo&s;t lively joy and gratitude, thanked God that &s;he was alive, and on his knees begged her for|givene&s;s. She a&s;&s;ured him, as well as her weakne&s;s would allow, that &s;he forgave him all.</P>
<P>The good women now ha&s;tened to make a fire, and to warm her bed, for they found &s;he &s;hivered violently; when they had put her into it, the lady brought her a gla&s;s of warm wine and water, &s;ome of which &s;he pre|vailed
<PB N="36" REF="035296_0130_1001C00664D926B8">on her to &s;wallow.&mdash;Tricket, who&s;e angui&s;h had taken off his intoxication, put his children again into their little bed; he gazed upon them and their mother by turns; whil&s;t his heart was wrung with the &s;en&s;e of their wants and his own wickedne&s;s. His wife fell a&s;leep &s;oon after the refre&s;hment &s;he had taken; but in a few hours awoke in a burning fever.&mdash;Tricket watched by her &s;ide: when he felt her hand and head as hot as fire, his fears returned, and he ran out of the hou&s;e to fetch an apothecary; though he recollected that he had nothing to pay for help, or even nece&s;&s;ary food for her: however, he went into the &s;treet, taking a club &s;tick in his hand, and had not gone half way to the apothecary's, when, on turning a corner, he &s;aw a gentleman, walking alone before him. Tricket at that moment looking round the &s;treet, &s;aw no creature near. Suddenly it darted into his mind, that he might now get bread for his wife and children, and that he could e&s;cape home again before any one could detect him; he &s;topt not for recollection, but &s;triking the gentleman with all his force on the back of his head, felled him to the ground, and was rifling his pockets, when a watch|man, turning the &s;ame corner Tricket had done, ran up, winding his rattle as he ran.</P>
<P>Tricket tried to e&s;cape; but the rattle brought watch|men from &s;o many quarters, that he was &s;oon &s;ecured; whil&s;t &s;ome of them conveyed him to the round-hou&s;e, others a&s;&s;i&s;ted the gentleman to ri&s;e; having been only &s;tunned, he &s;oon recovered his &s;peech, and directed the men to lead him to his hou&s;e, which was not far off.&mdash;There they a&s;ked him whether he was robbed? and on examining his pockets, he found that he had lo&s;t his watch, and his pur&s;e, both of which he particularly de|&s;cribed. The watch he could &s;wear to, if he &s;aw it; and he told the colour of the pur&s;e, and what money it contained, of which he gave the watchmen a memo|randum.&mdash;They then returned to the round-hou&s;e,
<PB N="37" REF="035296_0131_1001C00B4F7EE370">where, on &s;earching the pri&s;oner, the watch and pur&s;e were found upon him.&mdash;He would not an&s;wer any of their que&s;tions, but remained in gloomy &s;ilence.</P>
<P>When the day was more advanced, they carried him before a Ju&s;tice of the Peace, and gave in their infor|mation. Tricket was now obliged to &s;peak; and &s;ee|ing clearly that he mu&s;t be convicted, he bur&s;t into an agony of grief, and confe&s;&s;ed the whole; but he plead|ed the di&s;tre&s;s to which his wife and family were redu|ced, which alone, he &s;aid, "had led him to this ra&s;h action:" and he repeatedly ob&s;erved, that &s;ince he was driven to it by <HI>necessity,</HI> he hoped that both his Wor|&s;hip and the Gentleman would let him go: and he prote&s;ted that, till the fatal moment when he &s;aw the Gentleman, and thought he might re&s;cue his wife from death, and his children from &s;tarving, he had never en|tertained a thought of committing &s;uch a crime.</P>
<P>In an&s;wer to this &s;peech of Tricket, the Ju&s;tice (who was well acquainted with Tricket's whole character and hi&s;tory) remarked, "that although the crime in que&s;tion, was committed on the &s;udden, and though it aro&s;e out of the man's di&s;tre&s;s, yet, that di&s;tre&s;s had been brought upon him evidently by gaming." "My friend," &s;aid he, "you have gone from one &s;tep to ano|ther, as almo&s;t every other per&s;on has done, that has been brought before me. Fir&s;t, when you were in a good place you were negligent of your work through the love of gaming; and when for this cau&s;e you lo&s;t your employment, you then took to gambling more de&s;perately than ever, through a nece&s;&s;ity which you brought upon your&s;elf. Your nece&s;&s;ities next led you to take from your wife her little earnings, and when you had thus nearly driven her to di&s;traction, then it was that you began to feel for the wants of your wife and children; and thus you were driven by another ne|ce&s;&s;ity of your own making to rob on the highway for her relief.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="035296_0132_1001C00FA1DD8670">
"I cannot help therefore tracing your crime entirely to your gaming, for it is this which has brought you into temptation; and no man can tell when he has once tre&s;pa&s;&s;ed, as you have done, to what lengths the De|vil at one time or other may &s;uddenly drive him. In|&s;tead, therefore, of excu&s;ing your&s;elf, let me advi&s;e you to con&s;ider how happy for you it is, that the gentleman whom you &s;truck is not killed; for in that ca&s;e you would have been brought before me, not for the rob|bery and a&s;&s;ault only, but for murder.</P>
<P>Poor Tricket was much affected by the&s;e remarks, and did not utter a word more in the way of excu&s;e for his crime; but he begged and prayed the Gentleman, for his dear wife's &s;ake, not to hang him. Upon which the Ju&s;tice interfered, and told Tricket, that "as to the nature of his puni&s;hment, that mu&s;t depend upon circum&s;tances that would appear on the trial;" and he immediately bound the Gentleman over to pro&s;ecute.</P>
<P>While this &s;cene was pa&s;&s;ing at the Ju&s;tice's, poor Mrs. Tricket was left in a doleful ca&s;e. She was told by her hu&s;band, when he went away, that he was only going to run to the apothecary's, in order to bring &s;ome help to her, and that he would be back in&s;tantly; two hours pa&s;&s;ed and &s;he heard nothing of him: &s;he began to &s;u&s;pect &s;omething dreadful, and her mind gr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">w &s;o agitated, that her brain &s;eemed on fire, and her &s;en&s;es for&s;ook her.&mdash;It happened that a gentleman who had been pre&s;ent at the Ju&s;tice's (having been drawn thi|ther by the croud) called, from motives of humanity, in the cour&s;e of the day to inquire into the &s;tate of Tric|ket's family; and he was the fir&s;t per&s;on who brought intelligence of the horrible event that had taken place. As Mrs. Tricket was &s;o ill, the only &s;tep that could be taken at pre&s;ent, was to bring the apothecary to her; who, by laying on a bli&s;ter, and giving her proper me|dicines, abated the fever, and took off the delirium: but as her rea&s;on returned, her anxiety about her hus|band
<PB N="39" REF="035296_0133_1001C0011C9E3671">returned al&s;o, and &s;he ince&s;&s;antly begged to know what was become of him. Still it was thought that the dreadful truth mu&s;t not be told her, le&s;t it &s;hould bring back her di&s;traction; and it was not till three days af|ter, when the apothecary declared her to be much bet|ter, that the &s;ad condition of her hu&s;band was revealed to her.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner was this affecting di&s;covery made to Mrs. Tricket, than &s;he grew eager to get out of bed, to go to her hu&s;band in the pri&s;on; but her weakne&s;s made it impo&s;&s;ible.&mdash;It was with great difficulty that &s;he was kept in the hou&s;e after &s;he was able to ri&s;e; and the fir&s;t moment that &s;he could extort from the apothecary permi&s;&s;ion to &s;tir out, &s;he put her&s;elf into a coach (for &s;he had not &s;trength to walk) and leaving her children in the care of her humane landlady, arrived at the pri|&s;on. The &s;ight of her threw Tricket into an agony, yet he was glad to &s;ee her alive, and by degrees was &s;oothed and comforted by her kindne&s;s and affection.&mdash;She entreated him with many tears, to make his peace with God by &s;incere repentance, and to tru&s;t in his mercy for forgivene&s;s. She then, through her natural fondne&s;s and partiality for her hu&s;band, endeavored to find out &s;ome circum&s;tances of mitigation; and parti|cularly remarked, "that &s;ince it was his affection for her and for his &s;tarving family, that had put him on this ra&s;h action, &s;he hoped that when the trial came on, the Judge would &s;hew mercy to him." "Oh! If that could be," &s;aid Tricket, "I think I &s;hould never again fall into my former vices; but I dare not hope it; the rob|bery is fully proved, and it is no thanks to me, as his wor&s;hip very ju&s;tly ob&s;erved, that murder was not al&s;o the con&s;equence of my villainous action; my trial &s;oon comes on; prepare your mind for the &s;ad &s;entence, and pray for me that I al&s;o may be prepared for a more aw|ful trial after death." She now fell on her knees, and he knelt by her, and both implored forgivene&s;s at
<PB N="40" REF="035296_0134_1001C01894F3EFF8">the throne of Grace, with &s;uch feelings of contrition, that they ro&s;e up, hoping that their prayers had been heard through the great Saviour of mankind: and their minds now became more calm and more re&s;igned to the event, whatever it might be.</P>
<P>Tricket was convicted at the next a&s;&s;ines on the cleare&s;t evidence, and &s;entenced to death; but &s;ome fa|vorable circum&s;tances in his ca&s;e were reported to his Maje&s;ty by the Judge, and the &s;entence was in con&s;e|quence changed from death to tran&s;portation.</P>
<P>The fear of death at fir&s;t made even Botany Bay ap|pear a deliverance, but when he was to depart thither, bitter indeed was the affliction of his faithful wife; for &s;ince he had appeared a penitent, &s;he had become &s;o much endeared to him, that all his pa&s;t injuries being quite forgotten, his leaving her was wor&s;e than death.</P>
<P>She was earne&s;tly de&s;irous to go with him, but find|ing that &s;he could not be allowed to take her children, &s;he tho't it her duty not to for&s;ake them; at lea&s;t un|der the pre&s;ent circum&s;tances, nor indeed would he con&s;ent to her departure. The excellency of Mrs. Tricket's character was the occa&s;ion of rai&s;ing her up many friends, who furni&s;hed her with work, and who a&s;&s;i&s;ted both in educating and apprenticing her chil|dren.</P>
<P>Her mind was re&s;tored in &s;ome mea&s;ure to peace and tranquillity; and &s;he found that they who faithfully do their own duty, and put their tru&s;t in God are not for|&s;aken by him, however unhappy they may be in their outward circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>Such is the &s;ad &s;tory of poor Tricket, the Game&s;ter! Let each reader lay to heart the dreadful con&s;equences of Gambling; for by fir&s;t bringing a man to want, it will harden his heart even again&s;t his mo&s;t beloved wife and children; and who knows whether it may not al&s;o drive him to tho&s;e criminal acts, for which his very life may be ju&s;tly forfeited to the laws of his country.</P>

<HEAD>BETTY BROWN, THE St. GiLES's ORANGE GIRL: WITH SOME ACCOUNT OF Mrs. SPONGE, THE MONEY LENDER.</HEAD>
<P>BETTY Brown, the Orange Girl, was born nobo|dy knows where, and bred nobody knows how. No girl in all the &s;treets of London could drive a barrow more nimbly, avoid pu&s;hing again&s;t pa&s;&s;engers more dexterou&s;ly, or cry her "Fine China Oranges" in a &s;hriller voice.&mdash;But then &s;he could neither &s;ew, nor &s;pin, nor knit, nor wa&s;h, nor iron, nor read, nor &s;pell. Betty had not been always in &s;o good a &s;itua|tion as that in which we now de&s;cribe her. She came into the world before &s;o many good gentlemen and la|d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">es began to con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ern them&s;elves &s;o kindly that the poor might have a little learning. There was no charitable Society then, as there is now, to pick up poor friend|le&s;s children in the &s;treets, and put them into a good hou&s;e, and give them meat, and drink, and lodging, and learning, and teach them to get their bread in an hone&s;t way into the bargain. Whereas, this now is often the ca&s;e in London, ble&s;&s;ed be God for all his m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rcies.</P>
<P>The longe&s;t thing that Betty can remember is, that &s;he u&s;ed to crawl up out of a night cellar, &s;troll about the &s;treets, and pick cinders from the &s;cavenger's carts. Among the a&s;hes &s;he &s;ometimes found &s;ome ragged gauze and dirty ribbons; with the&s;e &s;he u&s;ed to dizen her&s;elf out and join the merry bands on the fir&s;t of May. This was not however quite fair, as &s;he did not law|fully belong either to the female dancers who foot it gaily round the garland, or to the footy it be, who, on
<PB N="42" REF="035296_0136_1001C020D19841D8">this happy holiday, forget their whole years toil; &s;he often, however, got a few &s;craps, by appearing to be|long to both parties.</P>
<P>Betty was not an idle girl; &s;he always put her&s;elf in the way of doing &s;omething.&mdash;She would run of er|rands for the footmen, or &s;weep the door for the maid of any hou&s;e where &s;he was known; &s;he would run and fetch &s;ome porter, and never was once known ei|ther to &s;ip a drop, or &s;teal the pot. Her quickne&s;s and fidelity in doing little jobs, got her into favor with a lazy cook-maid, who was too apt to give away her ma&s;ter's cold meat and beer, not to tho&s;e who were mo&s;t in want, but to tho&s;e who waited upon her, and did the little things which &s;he ought to have done her|&s;elf.</P>
<P>The cook, who found Betty a dextrous girl, &s;oon employed her to &s;ell ends of candles, pieces of meat and chee&s;e, and lumps of butter, or any thing el&s;e &s;he could crib from the hou&s;e. The&s;e were all carried to her friend Mrs. Sponge, who kept a little &s;hop, and a kind of eating hou&s;e for poor-working people, not far from the Seven Dials. She al&s;o bought as well as &s;old many kind of &s;econd hand things, and was not &s;crupulous to know whether what &s;he bought was hone&s;tly come by, provided &s;he got it for a &s;ixth part of what it was worth. But if the owner pre&s;umed to a&s;k for its real value, &s;he had &s;udden qualms of con&s;cience, &s;u&s;pected the things were &s;tolen, and gave her&s;elf airs of hone&s;ty, which often took in poor &s;illy people, and gave her a &s;ort of half reputation among the needy and the igno|rant, who&s;e friend &s;he pretended to be.</P>
<P>To this artful woman Betty carried the cook's pil|ferings, and as Mrs. Sponge would give no great price for the&s;e in money, the cook was willing to receive payment for her eatables in Mrs. Sponge's drinkables; for &s;he dealt in all kinds of &s;pirits. I &s;hall only ju&s;t re|mark
<PB N="43" REF="035296_0137_1001C0240DEB1858">here, that one receiver, like Mrs. Sponge, makes many pilferers, who are t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">pted to the&s;e petty thieve|ries, by knowing how ea&s;y it is to di&s;po&s;e of them as &s;uch iniquitous hou&s;es.</P>
<P>Betty was faithful to both her employers, which is ex|traordinary, con&s;idering the greatne&s;s of the tempta|tion, and her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tter ignorance of good and evil. One day, &s;he ventured to a&s;k Mrs. Sponge if &s;he could not a&s;|&s;i&s;t her to get into a more &s;ettled way of life. She told her, that when the ro&s;e in the morning, &s;he never knew where &s;he &s;hould lie at night, nor was &s;he ever fare of a meal before hand. Mrs. Sponge a&s;ked her what &s;he thought her&s;elf &s;it for. Betty with fear and trem|bling, &s;aid, there was one trade for which &s;he thought her&s;elf qualified, but &s;he had not the ambition to look &s;o high. It was far above her humble views. This was to have a barrow, and &s;ell fruit, as &s;everal other of Mrs. Sponge's cu&s;tomers did, whom &s;he had often looked at with envy.</P>
<P>Mrs. Sponge was an artful woman. Bad as &s;he was &s;he was always aiming at &s;omething of a character, this was a great help to her trade. While &s;he wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ched <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eenly to make every thing turn to her own profit, &s;he had a fal&s;e fawning way of &s;eeming to do all &s;he did out of pity and kindne&s;s to the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed; and &s;he &s;eldom committed an extortion, but &s;he tried to make the per|&s;on &s;he cheated believe them&s;elves highly obliged to her kindne&s;s. By thus pretending to be their friend, &s;he gained their con&s;idence, and &s;he grew rich her&s;elf whi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> they tho't &s;he was only &s;hewing favor to them. Va|rious 07 were the arts &s;he had of getting rich. The mo|ney &s;he got by grinding the poor, &s;he &s;pent in the mo&s;t laxurious living; and, while &s;he would haggle with her hungry cu&s;tomers for a farthing, &s;he would &s;pend pounds on the mo&s;t co&s;tly delicacies for her&s;elf.</P>
<P>Mrs. Sponge, laying a&s;ide that haughty look and voice, well known to &s;uch as had the mi&s;fortune to be
<PB N="44" REF="035296_0138_1001C027C2CD9EF0">in her debt, put on the hypocritical &s;mile and &s;oft tone, which &s;he always a&s;&s;umed when &s;he meant to take in her dependents. "Betty" &s;aid &s;he, "I am re&s;olved to &s;tand your friend. The&s;e are &s;ad times to be &s;ure.&mdash;Money is money now. Yet I am re&s;olved to put you into a hand&s;ome way of living. You &s;hall have a bar|row, and well furni&s;hed too." Betty could not have felt more joy or gratitude, if &s;he had been told that &s;he &s;hould have a coach. "O, madam," &s;aid Betty, "It is impo&s;&s;ible. I have not a penny in the world towards helping me to &s;et up." "I will take care of that," &s;aid Mrs. Sponge; "only you mu&s;t do as I bid you. You mu&s;t pay me intere&s;t for my money. And you will, of cour&s;e be glad al&s;o to pay &s;o much every night for a nice hot &s;upper which I get ready, quite out of kindne&s;s, for a number of poor working people. This wll be a great comfort for &s;uch a friendle&s;s girl as you, for my victuals and drink are the be&s;t; and my company the merrie&s;t of any hou&s;e in all St. Giles's." Betty thought all this only &s;o many more favors, and courte&s;ying to the ground, &s;aid, "to be &s;ure, Ma'am, and thank you a thou&s;and times into the bargain."</P>
<P>Mrs. Sponge knew what &s;he was about. Betty was a lively girl, who had a knack at learning any thing; and &s;o well looking through all her dirt and rags, that there was little doubts &s;he would get cu&s;tom. A bar|row was &s;oon provided, and five &s;hillings was put into Betty's hands. Mrs Sponge kindly conde&s;cended to go to &s;hew her how to buy the fruit, for it was a rule with this prudent gentlewoman, and one from which &s;he ne|ver departed, that no one &s;hould cheat but her&s;elf.&mdash;Betty had never po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;uch a &s;um before.&mdash;She grudged to lay it out all at once, and was ready to fan|cy &s;he could live upon the capital. The crown, how|ever, was laid out to the be&s;t advantage.&mdash;Betty was carefully taught in what manner to cry her Oranges: and received many u&s;eful le&s;&s;ons how to get off the bad
<PB N="45" REF="035296_0139_1001C029AFF8E628">with the good, and the &s;tale with the fre&s;h.&mdash;Mrs. Sponge al&s;o lent h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> few bad &s;ixpences, for which &s;he ordered her to bring <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">me good ones at night. Betty &s;tared. Mrs Sponge &s;aid, "Betty, tho&s;e who would get money, mu&s;t not be too nice about trifles. Keep one of the&s;e &s;ixpences in your hand, and if an ignorant young cu&s;tomer gives you a good &s;ixpence, do you im|mediately &s;lip it into your other hand, and give him the bad one, declaring that is the very one you have ju&s;t received, and that you have not another &s;ixpence in the world. You mu&s;t al&s;o learn how to treat different &s;orts of cu&s;tomers. To &s;ome you may put off with &s;afety, goods which would be quite un&s;aleable to others. Ne|ver offer bad fruit, Betty, to tho&s;e who know better: never wa&s;te the good on tho&s;e who may be put off with wor&s;e; put good Oranges at top and the mouldy ones under."</P>
<P>Poor Betty had not a nice con&s;cience, for &s;he had n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|er learnt that grand but &s;imple rule of all moral obliga|tion, "Never do that to another which you would not have another do to you."&mdash;She &s;et off with her bar|row as proud and as happy as if &s;he had been &s;et up in the fine&s;t &s;hop in Covent Garden. Betty had a &s;ort of natural good nature, which made her unwilling to im|po&s;e, but &s;he had no principle which told her it was a &s;in. She had &s;uch good &s;ucce&s;s, that when night came, &s;he had not an Orange left. With a light heart, &s;he drove her empty barrow to Mrs. Sponge's door. She went in with a merry face, and threw down on the coun|ter every farthing &s;he had taken, "Betty" &s;aid Mrs. Sponge, "I have a right to it all, as it was got by my money. But I am too generous to take it.&mdash;I will therefore only take &s;ixpence for this day's u&s;e of my five &s;hillings. This is a mo&s;t rea&s;onable intere&s;t, and I will lend you the &s;ame &s;um to trade with to-morrow, and &s;o on; you only paying <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ixpence for the u&s;e of it every night which will be a great bargain to you.&mdash;
<PB N="46" REF="035296_0140_1001C02E0EA7F400">You mu&s;t al&s;o pay me my price every night for your &s;upper, and you &s;hall have an excellent lodging above &s;tairs; &s;o you &s;ee every thing will now be provided for you in a genteel manner, through my genero&s;ity."</P>
<P>Poor Betty's gratitude blinded her &s;o completely that &s;he forgot to calculate the va&s;t proportion which this generous benefactre&s;s was to receive out of her little gains. She thought her&s;elf a happy creature, and went in to &s;upper with a number of others of her own cla&s;s. For this &s;upper, and for more porter and gin than &s;he ought to have drank, Betty was forced to pay &s;o high, that it eat up all the profits of the day, which added to the daily intere&s;t, made Mrs. Sponge a rich return for her five &s;hillings.</P>
<P>Betty was reminded again of the gentility of her new &s;ituation, as &s;he crept up to bed in one of Mrs. Sponge's garrets, five &s;tories high. This loft, to be &s;ure, was &s;mall, and had no window, but what it wanted in light was made up in company, as it had three L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ds, and thrice as many lodgers. Tho&s;e gentry had one night in a drunken frolic, broke down the door, which h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ppi|ly had never been replaced; for &s;ince that time, the lodgers had died much &s;eldomer of infectious di&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|pers. For this lodging, Betty paid twice as much to her good friend as &s;he would have done to a &s;tranger. Thus &s;he continued, with great indu&s;try and a th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ing trade, as poor as on the fir&s;t day, and not a bit nearer to &s;aving money enough even to buy her a pair of &s;hoes, though her feet were nearly on the ground.</P>
<P>One day, as Betty was driving her barrow through a &s;treet near Holborn, a lady from a window called out to her that &s;he wanted &s;ome Oranges. While the &s;er|vant went to fetch a plate, the lady entered into &s;ome talk with Betty, having been &s;truck with her hone&s;t countenance and civil manner. She que&s;tioned her as to her way of life, and the profit of her trade&mdash;and Betty, who had never been &s;o kindly treated before by
<PB N="47" REF="035296_0141_1001C03032368DA0">&s;o genteel a per&s;on, was very communicative. She told her little hi&s;tory as far as &s;he knew it, and dwelt much on the genero&s;ity of Mrs. Sponge, in keeping her in her hou&s;e, and tru&s;ting her with &s;o large a capital as five &s;hillings. At fir&s;t it &s;ounded like a very good natured thing, but the lady, who&s;e hu&s;band was one of the Ju&s;|tices of the new Police, happened to know more of Mrs. Sponge than was good, which led her to enquire &s;till further. Betty owned, that to be &s;ure it was not all clear profit, for that be&s;ides that the high price of the &s;upper and bed ran away with all &s;he got, &s;he paid &s;ixpence a day for the u&s;e of the five &s;hillings. "And how long have you done this," &s;aid the lady? "About a year Madam."</P>
<P>The lady's eyes were at once opened. "My poor girl," &s;aid &s;he, "do you know that you have already paid for that &s;ingle five &s;hillings the enormous &s;um of 7<ABBR>l.</ABBR> 10<ABBR>s.</ABBR>? I believe it is the mo&s;t profitable five &s;hillings Mrs. Sponge ever laid out." "Oh, no, Madam," &s;aid the girl, "that good gentlewoman does the &s;ame kind|ne&s;s to ten or twelve other poor friendle&s;s creatures like me." "Does &s;he &s;o?" &s;aid the lady, "then I never heard of a better trade than this woman carries on, un|der the ma&s;k of charity, at the expence of her poor fel|low-creatures."</P>
<P>"But Madam," &s;aid Betty, who did not comprehend this lady's arithmetic, "what can I do? I now contrive to pick up a mor&s;el of bread without begging or &s;teal|ing. Mrs. Sponge has been very good to me, and I don't &s;ee how I can help my&s;elf."</P>
<P>"I will tell you" &s;aid the lady. "If you will fol|low my advice, you may not only maintain your&s;elf ho|ne&s;tly, but independently. Only oblige your&s;elf to live hard for a little time, till you have &s;aved five &s;hillings out of your own earnings.&mdash;Give up that expen&s;ive &s;upper at night, drink only one pint of porter, and no gin at all. As &s;oon as you have &s;craped together the
<PB N="48" REF="035296_0142_1001C03902912E48">five &s;hillings, carry it back to your fal&s;e friend, and if you are indu&s;trious, you will at the end of the year have &s;aved &s;even pounds ten &s;hillings. If you can make a &s;hift to live now, when you have this heavy intere&s;t to pay, judge how things will mend when your capital becomes your own.&mdash;You will put &s;ome cloaths on your back, and by leaving the u&s;e of &s;pirits, and the company in which you drink them, your health, your morals, and your condition will mend."</P>
<P>The lady did not talk thus to &s;ave her money. She would gladly have given the girl the five &s;hillings; but &s;he thought it was beginning at the wrong end. She wanted to try her. Be&s;ides, &s;he know there was much more plea&s;ure as well as honor in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing five &s;hillings of one's own &s;aving than of another's giving.&mdash;Betty promi&s;ed to obey. She owned &s;he got no good by the company or the liquor at Mrs. Sponge's. She promi|&s;ed that very night to begin &s;aving the expence of the &s;upper, and that &s;he would not ta&s;te a drop of gin till &s;he had the five &s;hillings before hand. The lady, who knew the power of good habits, was contented with this, thinking, that if the girl could ab&s;tain, for a certain time, it would become ea&s;y to her.&mdash;She therefore at pre&s;ent &s;aid little about the &s;in of drinking.</P>
<P>In a very few weeks, Betty had &s;aved up the five &s;hillings.&mdash;She went to carry back this money with great gratitude to Mrs. Sponge. This kind friend be|gan to abu&s;e her mo&s;t unmercifully. She called her many hard names not fit to repeat, for having for&s;aken the &s;upper, by which &s;he &s;wore &s;he got nothing at all; but as &s;he had the charity to dre&s;s it for &s;uch beggarly wretches, &s;he in&s;i&s;ted they &s;hould pay for it whether they ate it or no. She al&s;o bro't in a heavy &s;core for lodg|ing, though Betty had paid for it every night, and giv|en notice of her intending to quit her. By all the&s;e fal&s;e pretences, &s;he got from her not only her own five &s;hillings, but all the little capital with which Betty was
<PB N="49" REF="035296_0143_1001C03CE3C1A7F0">going to &s;et up for her&s;elf. As all was not &s;ufficient to an&s;wer her demands, &s;he declared &s;he would &s;end her to pri&s;on, but while &s;he went to call a con&s;table, Betty contrived to make off.</P>
<P>With a light pocket and a heavy heart, &s;he went to the lady, and with many tears, told her &s;ad &s;tory. The lady's hu&s;band, the Ju&s;tice, conde&s;cended to li&s;ten to Betty's tale. He &s;aid Mrs. Sponge had long been up|on his books as a receiver of &s;tolen goods. Betty's evi|dence &s;trengthened his bad opinion of her.&mdash;"This pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ty &s;y&s;tem of u&s;ury," &s;aid the gentleman, "may be thought trifling, but it will no longer appear &s;o, if you reflect, that if one of the&s;e female &s;harpers po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a capital of &s;eventy &s;hillings, or 3 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> 10 <ABBR>s.</ABBR> with fourteen &s;teady regular cu&s;tomers, &s;he can realize a fixed income of 100 guineas a year. Add to this the influence &s;uch a loan gives her over the&s;e friendle&s;s creatures by com|pelling them to eat at her hou&s;e, or lodge or buy li|quors, or by taking their pawns, and you will &s;ee the extent of the evil. I pity the&s;e poor victims: You, Betty, &s;hall point out &s;ome of them to me. I will en|deavor to open their eyes on their own bad manage|ment. It is one of the greate&s;t acts of kindne&s;s to the poor to mend their oeconomy, and to give them right views of laying out their little money to advantage.&mdash;The&s;e poor blinded creatures look no farther than to be able to pay this heavy intere&s;t every night, and to obtain the &s;ame loan on the &s;ame hard terms the next day. Thus are they kept in poverty and bondage all their lives; but I hope as many as hear of this will get on a better plan, and I &s;hall be ready to help any who are willing to help them&s;elves." This worthy Magi&s;|trate went directly to Mrs. Sponge's with proper offi|cers, and he got to the bottom of many iniquities. He not only made her refund poor Betty's money, but committed her to pri&s;on for receiving &s;tolen goods, and
<PB N="50" REF="035296_0144_1001A32DC419D5D0">various other offences, which may perhaps make the &s;ubject of another hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>Betty was now &s;et up in trade to her hearts content. She had found the benefit of leaving off &s;pirits, and &s;he re&s;olved to drink them no more.&mdash;The fir&s;t fruits of this re&s;olution was, that in a fortnight &s;he bought her a new pair of &s;hoes, and as there was now no deduc|tion for intere&s;t or for gin, her earnings became con&s;i|derable. The lady made her a pre&s;ent of a gown and a hat, on the ea&s;y condition that &s;he &s;hould go to church. She accepted the terms, at fir&s;t, rather as an act of obe|dience to the lady, than from a &s;en&s;e of a higher duty. But &s;he &s;oon began to go from a better motive. This con&s;tant attendance at church, joined to the in&s;tructions of the lady, opened a new world to Betty. She now heard, for the fir&s;t time, that &s;he was a &s;inner; that God had given a law which was holy, ju&s;t, and good; that &s;he had broken this law; had been a &s;wearer, a &s;abbath-breaker, and had lived without God in the world. All this was &s;ad news to Betty; &s;he knew indeed that there were &s;inners, but &s;he thought they were only to be &s;ound in the pri&s;ons or at Botany Bay, or in tho&s;e mournful carts which &s;he had &s;ometimes fol|lowed with her barrow, with the unthinking croud, to Tyburn. She was mo&s;t &s;truck with the great truths revealed in the &s;cripture, which were quite new to her. She was de&s;irous of improvement, and &s;aid &s;he would give up all the profits of her barrow, and go into the harde&s;t &s;ervice, rather than live in &s;in and ignorance.</P>
<P>"Betty," &s;aid the lady, "I am glad to &s;ee you &s;o well di&s;po&s;ed, and will do what I can for you. Your pre&s;ent way of life, to be &s;ure, expo&s;es you to much danger; but the trade is not unlawful in it&s;elf, and we may plea&s;e God in any calling, provided it be not a di&s;|hone&s;t one. In this great town there mu&s;t be barrow-women to &s;ell fruit. Do you, then, in&s;tead of for&s;a|king your bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;et a good example to tho&s;e in it,
<PB N="51" REF="035296_0145_1001C04553217DD0">and &s;hew them, that though a dangerous trade, it need not be a bad one. Till Providence points out &s;ome &s;afer way of getting your bread, let your companions &s;ee, that it is po&s;&s;ible to be good even in this. Your trade being carried on in the open &s;treet, and your fruit bought in an open &s;hop, you are not &s;o much obliged to keep &s;inful company as may be thought. Take a garret in an hone&s;t hou&s;e, to which you may go home in &s;afety at night. I will give you a bed and a few ne|ce&s;&s;aries to furni&s;h your room; and I will al&s;o give you a con&s;tant Sunday's dinner. A barrow woman, ble&s;&s;ed be God and our good laws, is as much her own mi&s;|tre&s;s on Sundays as a Duche&s;s; and the Church and the Bible are as much open t&oacute; her.&mdash;You may &s;oon learn all that &s;uch as you are expected to know.&mdash;A barrow woman may pray as heartily morning and night, and &s;erve God as acceptably all day, while &s;he is car|rying on her little trade, as if &s;he had her whole time to &s;pare.</P>
<P>To do this well, you mu&s;t mind the following <HI>rules for Retail Dealers:</HI></P>
<P>Re&s;i&s;t every temptation to cheat.</P>
<P>Never impo&s;e bad goods on fal&s;e pretences.</P>
<P>Never put off bad money for good.</P>
<P>Never u&s;e prophane or uncivil language.</P>
<P>Never &s;wear your goods co&s;t &s;o much, when you know it is fal&s;e. By &s;o doing you are guilty of two &s;ins in one breath, a lie and an oath.</P>
<P>To break the&s;e rules, will be your chief temptation. God will mark how you behave under them, and will reward or puni&s;h you accordingly.&mdash;The&s;e tempta|tions will be as great to you as higher trials are to higher people; but you have the &s;ame God to look to for &s;trength to re&s;i&s;t them as they have.&mdash;You mu&s;t pray to him to give you this &s;trength. You &s;hall attend a Sunday School, where you will be taught the&s;e good
<PB N="52" REF="035296_0146_1001A332000C44A0">things, and I will promote you as you &s;hall be found to de&s;erve.</P>
<P>Poor Betty here bur&s;t into tears of joy and gratitude, crying out, "What, &s;hall &s;uch a poor friendle&s;s crea|ture as I be treated &s;o kindly, and learn to read the word of God too? Oh, Madam, what a lucky chance brought me to your door." "Betty," &s;aid the lady, "what you have ju&s;t &s;aid, &s;hews the need you have of being better taught; there is no &s;uch thing as chance, and we offend God when we call that luck or chance which is brought about by his will and plea&s;ure. None of the events of your life have happened by chance&mdash;but all have been under the direction of a good and kind Providence. He has permitted you to experience want and di&s;tre&s;s, that you might acknowledge his hand in your pre&s;ent comfort and pro&s;perity. Above all, you mu&s;t ble&s;s his goodne&s;s in &s;ending you to me, not only becau&s;e I have been of u&s;e to you in your worldly af|fairs, but becau&s;e he has enabled me to &s;hew you the danger of your &s;tate from &s;in and ignorance, and to put you in a way to know his will and to keep his command|ments.</P>
<P>How Betty, by indu&s;try and piety, ro&s;e in the world, till at length &s;he came to keep a hand&s;ome Sau&s;age &s;hop near the Seven Dials, and was married to an ho|ne&s;t Hackney Coachman, may be told at &s;ome future time, in a Second Part.</P>

<HEAD>BLACK GILES, THE POACHER;</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">With &s;ome account of a Family who had rather live by their Wits than their Work.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">PART I.</HEAD>
<P>POACHING GILES lived on the borders of one of tho&s;e great Moors in Somer&s;et&s;hire. Giles, to be &s;ure, has been a &s;ad fellow in his time; and it is none of his fault if his whole family do not end either at the gallows or at Botany Bay. He lives at the Mud Cottage with the broken windows, &s;tuffed with dirty rags, ju&s;t beyond the gate which divides the upper from the lower Moor. You may know the hou&s;e at a good di&s;tance by the ragged tiles on the roof, and the loo&s;e &s;tones which are ready to drop out from the chimney; though a &s;hort ladder, a hod of mortar, and half an hour's lei&s;ure time would have prevented all this, and made the little dwelling tight enough. But as Giles had never learnt any thing that was good, &s;o he did not know the value of &s;uch u&s;eful &s;ayings as, that "a tile in time &s;aves nine."</P>
<P>Be&s;ides this, Giles fell into that common mi&s;take, that a beggarly looking cottage, and filthy ragged chil|dren rai&s;ed mo&s;t compa&s;&s;ion, and of cour&s;e drew mo&s;t charity. But as cunning as he was in other things, he was out in his reckoning here; for it is neatne&s;s, hou&s;e|wifery, and a decent appearance, which draws the kindne&s;s of the rich and charitable, while they turn a|way di&s;gu&s;ted from filth and lazine&s;s; not out of pride, but becau&s;e they &s;ee that it is next to impo&s;&s;ible to
<PB N="54" REF="035296_0148_1001A3373895FE10">mend the condition of tho&s;e who degrade them&s;elves by dirt and &s;loth.</P>
<P>The common on which Giles's hovel &s;tands is quite a deep mar&s;h in a wet winter, but in &s;ummer it looks green and pretty enough. To be &s;ure it would be ra|ther convenient when one pa&s;&s;es that way in a car|riage, if one of the children would run out and open the gate, as it would &s;ave the po&s;t boy from getting off, which is not very &s;afe for the people within the chai&s;e; but in&s;tead of any one of the&s;e children running out as &s;oon as they hear the wheels, which would be quite time enough, what does Giles do, but &s;et all his ragged brats, with dirty faces, matted locks, and naked &s;eet and legs, to lie all day upon a &s;and bank hard by the gate, waiting for the &s;lender chance of what may be picked up from travellers. At the &s;ound of a carriage, whole coveys of the&s;e little &s;care-&s;erows &s;tart up, ru&s;h to the gate and all at once thru&s;t out their hats and aprons; and for fear this, together with the noi&s;e of their clam|orous begging, &s;hould not &s;ufficiently frighten the hor&s;es, they are very apt to let the gate &s;lap ful! again&s;t you, be|fore you are half way through, in their eager &s;cuffle to &s;natch from each other the half-pence which you may have thrown out to them. I know two ladies who were one day very near being killed by the&s;e abominable tricks.</P>
<P>Thus five or &s;ix little idle creatures, who might be earning a trifle by knitting at home; who might be u&s;eful to the public by working in the field, and who might a&s;&s;i&s;t their families by learning to get their bread twenty hone&s;t ways, are &s;uffered to lie about all day, in the hope of a few chance half-pence, which after all, they are by no means &s;ure of getting. Indeed, when the neighboring gentlefolks found out that opening the gate was the family trade, they &s;oon left off giving any thing. And I my&s;elf, though I u&s;ed to take out a pen|ny ready to give, had there been only one to receive it, when I &s;ee a whole family e&s;tabli&s;hed in &s;o beggarly a
<PB N="55" REF="035296_0149_1001C0580EEE4BD0">trade, quietly put it back again into my pocket, and give nothing at all.&mdash;And &s;o few travellers pa&s;s that way, that &s;ometimes, after the whole family have lo&s;t a day, their gains do not amount to two-pence.</P>
<P>As Giles had a far greater ta&s;te for living by his wits than his work, he was at one time in hopes that his children might have got a pretty penny by tumbling for the diver&s;ion of travellers, and he &s;et about training them in that indecent practice; but unluckily, the Moors being level, the carriages travelled fa&s;ter than the children tumbled.&mdash;He envied tho&s;e parents who lived on the London road, over the Wilt&s;hire Dowas, which being very hilly, enables the tumbler to keep pace with the traveller, till he &s;ometimes extorts from the light and the unthinking, a reward in&s;tead of a re|proof. I begleave, however, to put all gentlemen and ladies in mind that &s;uch tricks are a kind of apprentice|&s;hip to the trades of begging and thieving.</P>
<P>Giles, to be &s;ure, as his children grew older, began to train them to &s;uch other employments as the idle ha|bits they had learned at the gate very properly qualified them for. The right of Common, which &s;ome of the poor Cottagers have in that part of the country, and which is doubtle&s;s a con&s;iderable advantage to many, was converted by Giles into the means of corrupting his whole family, for his children, as &s;oon as they grew too big for the trade of begging at the gate, were pro|moted to the dignity of thieving on the Moor. Here he kept two or three a&s;&s;es, mi&s;erable beings, which, if they had the good fortune to e&s;cape death by &s;tar|ving, did not fail to meet with it by beating. Some of the bigge&s;t boys were &s;ent out with the&s;e lean and galled animals to carry &s;and or coals about the neighboring towns. Both &s;and and coals were often &s;tolen before they got them to &s;ell, or if not, they always took care to cheat in &s;elling them. By long practice in this art, they grew &s;o dextrous, that they could give a pretty
<PB N="56" REF="035296_0150_1001C05C58A9C438">good gue&s;s how large a coal they could crib out of ev|ery bag before the buyer would be likely to mi&s;s it.</P>
<P>All their odd time was taken up under the pretence of watching the&s;e a&s;&s;es on the Moor, or running after five or &s;ix half &s;tarved gee&s;e; but the truth is, the&s;e boys were only watching for an opportunity to &s;teal an odd goo&s;e of their neighbor's. They u&s;ed al&s;o to pluck the quills or the down from the&s;e poor live creatures, or half milk a cow before the farmer's maid came with her pail. They all knew how to calculate to a minute what time to be down in a morning to let out their lank, hungry bea&s;ts, which they had turned over night into the farmer's field, to &s;teal a little good pa&s;ture. They contrived to get there ju&s;t time enough to e&s;cape being caught in replacing the &s;takes they had pulled out for the cattle to get over. For Giles was a prudent, long|headed fellow, and wherever he &s;tole food for his colts, took care never to &s;teal &s;takes from the hedges at the &s;ame time. He had &s;en&s;e enough to know that the gain did not make up for the danger; he knew that a loo&s;e faggot, pulled from a neighbor's pile of wood after the family were gone to bed, an&s;wered the end better, and was not half the trouble.</P>
<P>Among the many trades which Giles profe&s;&s;ed, he &s;ometimes practi&s;ed that of a rat-catcher; but he was addicted to &s;o many tricks that he never followed the &s;ame trade long. Whenever he was &s;ent for to a farm|hou&s;e, his cu&s;tom was to kill a few of the old rats, al|ways taking care to leave a little &s;tock of young ones alive &s;ufficient to keep up the breed; for &s;aid he, "If I were to be &s;uch a fool as to clear a hou&s;e or a barn at once, how would my trade be carried on?" And where any barn was over&s;tocked, he u&s;ed to borrow a few from thence, ju&s;t to people a neighboring granary which had none; and he might have gone on till now, had he not unluckily been caught one evening emptying his cage of young rats under Par&s;on Wil&s;on's barn door.</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="035296_0151_1001C061B9F34038">
This worthy Mini&s;ter, Mr. Wil&s;on, u&s;ed to pity the neglected children of Giles as much as he blamed the wicked parents. He one day picked up Dick, who was far the be&s;t of Giles's bad boys. Dick was loiter|ing about in a field behind the Par&s;on's garden in &s;earch of a hen's ne&s;t, his mother having ordered him to bring home a few eggs that night by hook or by crook, as Giles was re&s;olved to have &s;ome pan-cakes for &s;upper, though he knew that eggs were a penny a piece. Mr. Wil&s;on had long been de&s;irous of &s;natching &s;ome of this vagrant family from ruin, and his chief hopes were bent on Dick, as the lea&s;t hackneyed in knavery. He had once given him a new pair of &s;hoes, on his promi&s;ing to go to &s;chool next Sunday; but no &s;ooner had Ra|chel, the boy's mother, got the &s;hoes into her clutches, than &s;he pawned them for a bottle of gin, and ordered the boy to keep out of the Par&s;on's &s;ight, and to be &s;ure to play his marbles on Sundays for the future, at the other end of the pari&s;h, and not near the Church-yard. Mr. Wil&s;on, however, picked up the boy once more, for it was not his way to de&s;pair of any body. Dick was ju&s;t going to take to his heels, as u&s;ual, for fear the old &s;tory of the &s;hoes &s;hould be brought forward; but find|ing he could not get off, what does he do but run into a little puddle of muddy water which lay between him and the Par&s;on, that the &s;ight of his naked feet might not bring on the dreaded &s;ubject.&mdash;Now it happened that Mr. Wil&s;on was planting a little field of beans, &s;o he thought this a good opportunity to employ Dick; he told him he had got &s;ome pretty ea&s;y work for him. Dick did as he was bid; he willingly went to work, and readily began to plant his beans with di&s;patch and regularity, according to the directions given him.</P>
<P>While the boy was bu&s;ily at work by him&s;elf, Giles happened to come by, having been &s;kulking round the back way, to look over the Par&s;on's garden wall, to &s;ee if there was any thing worthy climbing over for on
<PB N="58" REF="035296_0152_1001C06372A7C600">the en&s;uing night. He &s;pied Dick, and began to rate him for working for the &s;tingy old Par&s;on, for Giles had a natural antipathy to whatever belonged to the Church. "What has he promi&s;ed thee a day?" &s;aid he, "little enough, I dare &s;ay." "He is not to pay me by the day," &s;aid Dick, "but &s;ays he will give me &s;o much when I have planted this peck, and &s;o much for the next." "Oh, oh! that alters the ca&s;e," &s;aid Giles. "One may, indeed, get a trifle by this &s;ort of work.&mdash; Come, give me a handful of the beans. I will teach thee how to plant when thou art paid for planting by the peck. All we have to do in that ca&s;e is to di&s;patch the work as fa&s;t as we can, and get rid of the beans with all &s;peed; and as to the &s;eed coming up or not, that is no bu&s;ine&s;s of ours; we are paid for planting, not for growing. At the rate thou goe&s;t on, thou would&s;t not get &s;ix-pence to night. Come along, bury away." So &s;aying, he took his hat full of the &s;eed, and where Dick had been ordered to &s;et one bean, Giles buried a dozen. So the beans were &s;oon out. But though the peck was emptied, the ground was unplanted. But cunning Giles knew this could not be found out till the time when the beans might be expected to come up, "and then, Dick," &s;aid he, "the &s;nails and the mice may go &s;hares in the blame; or we can lay the fault on the rooks or the blackbirds." So &s;aying, he &s;ent the boy into the Par&s;onage to receive his pay, taking care to &s;ecure about a quarter of the peck of beans for his own colt he put both bag and beans into his own pocket to carry home, bidding Dick tell Mr. Wil&s;on that he had planted his beans and lo&s;t the bag.</P>
<P>In the mean time Giles's other boys were bu&s;y in emptying the ponds and trout &s;treams in the neighbor|ing manor. They would &s;teal away the carp and tench when they were no bigger than gud<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eons; by this un|timely depredation they plundered the owner of his pro|perty, without enriching them&s;elves. But the plea&s;ure

<P>Giles's boys had never &s;een the in&s;ide of a church &s;ince they were chri&s;tened, and the father thought he knew his own intere&s;t better than to force them to it; for church time was the &s;ea&s;on of their harve&s;t. Then the hens' ne&s;ts were &s;earched, a &s;tray duck was clap|ped under the &s;mock frock, the tools which might have been left by chance in a farm yard, were picked up, and all the neighboring pigeon-hou&s;es were thinned, &s;o that Giles u&s;ed to boa&s;t to his wife, that Sunday was to them the mo&s;t profitable day in the week. With her it was certainly the mo&s;t laborious day, as &s;he always did her wa&s;hing and ironing on the Sunday morning, it being, as &s;he &s;aid, the only lei&s;ure day &s;he had, for on oth|er days &s;he went about the country, telling fortunes, and &s;elling dream-books, and wicked &s;ongs. Neither her hu&s;band's nor her children's cloaths were ever mended, and if Sunday, her idle day, had not come a|bout once in every week, it is likely they would never have been wa&s;hed neither. You might, however, &s;ee her as you were going to church, &s;moothing her own rags on her be&s;t red cloak, which &s;he always u&s;ed for her ironing cloth on Sundays, for her cloak when &s;he tra|velled, and for her blanket at night; &s;uch a wretched manager was Rachel! among her other articles of trade
<PB N="60" REF="035296_0154_1001C0690E4EB458">one was to make and &s;ell pepper-mint, and other di&s;til|led waters.&mdash;The&s;e &s;he had the cheap art of making without trouble, and without expen&s;e, for &s;he made them without herbs and without a &s;till. Her way was to fill &s;o many quart bottles with plain water, putting a &s;poonful of mint water in the mouth of each; the&s;e &s;he corked down with ro&s;in, carrying to each cu&s;tomer a phial of real di&s;tilled water to ta&s;te, by way of &s;ample. This was &s;o good that her bottles were commonly bought up without being opened; but if any &s;u&s;picion aro&s;e, and &s;he was forced to uncork a bottle, by the few drops of di&s;tilled water lying on the top, &s;he even then e&s;caped detection, and took care to get out of reach before the bottle was opened a &s;econd time. She was too prudent ever to go twice to the &s;ame hou&s;e.</P>
<P>There is hardly any petty mi&s;chief that is not con|nected with the life of a poacher.&mdash;Mr. Wil&s;on was a ware of this; he was not only a pious clergyman, but an upright ju&s;tice. He u&s;ed to &s;ay that people who were truly con&s;cientious, mu&s;t be &s;o in &s;mall things as well as in great ones, or they would de&s;troy the effect of their own precepts, and their example would not be of general u&s;e. For this rea&s;on he never would accept of a hare or a partridge from any unqualified per&s;on in his pari&s;h. He did not content him&s;elf with &s;huffling the thing off by a&s;king no que&s;tions, and pretending to take it for granted in a general way, that the game was fair|ly come at; but he u&s;ed to &s;ay that by receiving the booty, he connived at a crime; made him&s;elf a &s;harer in it, and if he gave a pre&s;ent to the man who brought it, he even tempted him to repeat the fault.</P>
<P>One day poor Jack We&s;ton, an hone&s;t fellow in the neighborhood, whom Mr. Wil&s;on had kindly vi&s;ited and relieved in a long &s;ickne&s;s, from which he had but ju&s;t recovered, was brought before him as he was &s;itting on the ju&s;tice's bench; Jack was accu&s;ed of having knocked down a hare, and of all the birds in the air, who
<PB N="61" REF="035296_0155_1001C06D4D6B1EA0">&s;hould the informer be but Black Giles, the poacher? Mr. Wil&s;on was grieved at the charge, he had a great regard for Jack, but he had a &s;till greater regard for the law. The poor fellow pleaded guilty. He did not deny the fact, but &s;aid he did not con&s;ider it a crime, he did not think game was private property, and he owned he had a &s;trong temptation for doing what he had done which he hoped would plead in his excu&s;e. The ju&s;|tice de&s;ired to know what this temptation was. "Sir," &s;aid the poor fellow, "you know I was given over this &s;pring in a bad fever. I had no friend in the world but you, Sir, under God you &s;aved my life by your charita|ble relief; and I tru&s;t al&s;o you may have helped to &s;ave my &s;oul by your prayers and your good advice. I know I can never make you amends for all your good|ne&s;s, but I thought it would be &s;ome comfort to my full heart if I could but once give you &s;ome little token of my gratitude. So I had trained a pair of nice turtle doves for Madam Wil&s;on, but they were &s;tolen from me, Sir, and I do &s;u&s;pect Black Giles &s;tole them. Ye&s;|terday morning, Sir, I was crawling out to my work, for I am &s;till but very weak, a fine hare ran acro&s;s my path. I did not &s;tay to con&s;ider whether it was wrong to kill a hare, but I felt it was right to &s;hew my grati|tude; &s;o, Sir, without a moment's thought, I did knock down the hare which I was going to carry to your wor&s;hip, becau&s;e I knew Madam was fond of hare. I am truly &s;orry for my fault, and will &s;ubmit to whatev|er puni&s;hment your wor&s;hip may plea&s;e to inflict."</P>
<P>Mr. Wil&s;on was much moved with this hone&s;t con|fe&s;&s;ion, and touched with the poor fellow's gratitude. What added to the effect of the &s;tory, was the weak condition and pale &s;ickly looks of the offender. But this worthy ju&s;tice never &s;uffered his feelings to bias his integrity&punc; he knew that he did not &s;it on that bench to indulge pity, but to admini&s;ter ju&s;tice. And while he was &s;orry for the offender he would not ju&s;tify the
<PB N="62" REF="035296_0156_1001C074AF078148">offence. "John" &s;aid he, "I am &s;urpri&s;ed that you could for a moment forget that I never accept any gift which cau&s;es the giver to break a law. On Sunday I teach you from the pulpit the laws of God, who&s;e min|i&s;ter I am. At pre&s;ent I fill the chair of the magi&s;trate, to enforce and execute the laws of the land. Between tho&s;e and the others there is more connection than you are aware. I thank you, John, for your affection to me, and I admire your gratitude; but I mu&s;t not allow ei|ther affection or gratitude to be brought as a plea for a wrong action. It is not your bu&s;ine&s;s nor mine, John, to &s;ettle whether the game laws are good or bad. Till they are repealed we mu&s;t obey them. Many, I doubt not, break the&s;e laws through ignorance, and many I am certain, who would not dare to &s;teal a goo&s;e or a tur|key, make no &s;cruple to knock down a hare or a par|tridge. You will hereafter think your&s;elf happy that this your fir&s;t attempt has proved un&s;ucce&s;sful, as I tru&s;t you are too hone&s;t a fellow ever to intend to turn poach|er. With poaching much moral evil is connected; a habit of nightly depredation; a cu&s;tom of prowling in the dark for prey produces, in time, a di&s;reli&s;h for ho|ne&s;t labor. He who&s;e fir&s;t offence was committed without much thought or evil intention, if he happen to &s;ucceed a few times in carrying off his booty undi&s;cov|ered, grows bolder and bolder; and when he fancies there is no &s;hame attending it, he very &s;oon gets to per|&s;uade him&s;elf that there is al&s;o no &s;in. While &s;ome people pretend a &s;cruple about &s;tealing a &s;heep, they partly live by plundering of warrens. But remember that the warrener pays a high rent, and that therefore his rabbits are as much his property as his &s;heep. Do not then deceive your&s;elves with the&s;e fal&s;e di&s;tinctions. All property is &s;acred, and as the laws of the land are intended to fence in that property, he who brings up his children to break down any of the&s;e fences, brings them up to certain &s;in and ruin. He who begins with
<PB N="63" REF="035296_0157_1001A34B6CDF80C8">robbing orchards, rabbit warrens, and fish ponds, will probably end with hor&s;e-&s;tealing or highway robbery. Poaching is a regular apprentice&s;hip to bolder crimes. He whom I may commit as a boy to &s;it in the &s;tocks fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> killing a patridge, may be likely to end at the gallows for killing a man.</P>
<P>"Ob&s;erve, you who now hear me, the &s;trictne&s;s and impartiality of ju&s;tice. I know Giles to be a worthle&s;s fellow, yet it is my duty to take his information; I know Jack We&s;ton to be an hone&s;t youth, yet I mu&s;t be obliged to make him pay the penalty. Giles is a bad man, but he can prove this fact; Jack is a worthy lad, but he has committed this fault: I am &s;orry for you, Jack; but do not let it grieve you that Giles has played wor&s;e tricks a hundred times, and yet got off, while you were detected in the very fir&s;t offence, for that would be grieving becau&s;e you are not &s;o great a rogue as Giles. At this moment you think your good luck is very unequal; but all this will one day turn out in your favor. Giles is not the more the favorite of heaven becau&s;e he has hitherto e&s;caped Botany Bay, or the Hulks; nor is it any mark of God's di&s;plea&s;ure a|gain&s;t you, John, that you were found out in your very fir&s;t attempt."</P>
<P>Here the good ju&s;tice left off &s;peaking, and no one could contradict the truth of what he had &s;aid. We&s;ton humbly &s;ubmitted to his &s;entence, but he was very poor, and knew not where to rai&s;e the money to pay his &s;ine. His character had always been &s;o fair, that &s;everal far|mers pre&s;ent kindly agreed to advance a trifle each to prevent his being &s;ent to pri&s;on, and he thankfully pro|mi&s;ed to work out the debt. The ju&s;tice him&s;elf, tho' he could not &s;often the law, yet &s;howed We&s;ton &s;o much kindne&s;s, that he was enabled, before the year was out, to get out of this difficulty. He began to think more &s;eriou&s;ly than he had ever yet done, and grew to abhor poaching, not merely from fear, but from principle.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">With the Hi&s;tory of the Widow Brown's Apple Tree.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">PART II.</HEAD>
<P>I THINK my readers got &s;o well acquainted, la&s;t month, with Black Giles the Poacher, that they will not expect this month to hear any great good either of Giles him&s;elf, his wife Rachel, or any of their family. I am &s;orry to expo&s;e their tricks, but it is their fault, not mine. If I pretend to &s;peak about peo|ple at all I mu&s;t tell the truth. I am &s;ure if folks would but turn about and mend, it would be a thou&s;and times plea&s;anter to me to write their hi&s;tories; for it is no comfort to tell of any body's faults. If the world would but grow good, I &s;hould be glad enough to tell of it; but till it really becomes &s;o, I mu&s;t go on de&s;cribing it as it is; otherwi&s;e, I &s;hould only mi&s;lead my readers, in&s;tead of in&s;tructing them.</P>
<P>As to Giles and his boys, I am &s;ure old Widow Brown has good rea&s;on to remember their dexterity.&mdash;
<PB N="65" REF="035296_0159_1001C0804E30C448">Poor woman! &s;he had a fine little bed of onions in her neat and well-kept garden; &s;he was very fond of her onions, and many a rheumati&s;m has &s;he caught by kneel|ing down to weed them in a damp day, notwith&s;tand|ing the little flannel cloak and the bit of an old mat which Madam Wil&s;on gave her, becau&s;e the old woman would needs weed in wet weather. Her onions &s;he al|ways carefully trea&s;ured up for her winter's &s;tore; for an onion makes a little broth very reli&s;hing, and is indeed the only &s;avory thing poor people are u&s;ed to get. She al&s;o had a &s;mall orchard, containing about a dozen ap|ple trees, with which, in a good year, &s;he has been known to make a couple of barrels of cider, which &s;he &s;old to her landlord towards paying her rent, be&s;ides, having a little keg which &s;he was able to keep back for her own drinking. Well! would you believe it, Giles and his boys marked both onions and apples for their own; in|deed, a man who &s;tole &s;o many rabbits from the warren was likely enough to &s;teal onions for &s;auce. One day, when the widow was abroad on a little bu&s;ine&s;s, Giles and his boys made a clear riddance of the onion bed; and when they had pulled up every &s;ingle onion, they then turned a couple of pigs into the garden, who allu|red by the &s;mell, tore up the bed in &s;uch a manner, that the widow, when &s;he came home, had not the lea&s;t doubt but the pigs had been the thieves. To confirm this opinion, they took care to leave the little hatch half open at one end of the garden, and to break down a bit of a fence at the other end.</P>
<P>I wonder how any body can find in his heart not to pity and re&s;pect poor old widows. There is &s;omething &s;o forlorn and helple&s;s in their condition, that me thinks it is a call on every body, men, women and children, to do them all the kind &s;ervices that fall in their way.&mdash;Surely their having no one to take their part, is an addi|tional rea&s;on for kind hearted people not to hurt and oppre&s;s them. But it was this very rea&s;on which led Giles to do this woman an hurt.</P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="035296_0160_1001C084A5EE6360">
It happened unluckily for this poor widow that her cottage &s;tood quite alone. On &s;everal mornings toge|ther (for roguery gets up much earlier than indu&s;try,) Giles and his boys &s;tole regularly into her orchard, fol|lowed by their Jack A&s;&s;es. She was &s;o deaf that &s;he could not hear the a&s;&s;es if they had brayed ever &s;o loud, and to this Giles tru&s;ted; for he was very cautious in his rogueries; &s;ince he could not otherwi&s;e have con|trived to keep out of pri&s;on; for though he was almo&s;t always &s;u&s;pected, he had &s;eldom been taken up, and ne|ver convicted. The boys u&s;ed to fill their bags, load their a&s;&s;es, and then march off; and if in their way to the town where the apples were to be &s;old, they chan|ced to pa&s;s by one of their neighbors who might be likely to &s;u&s;pect them, they then all at once began to &s;cream out, "buy my coal!&mdash;buy my &s;and!"</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the trees in her orchard, poor Widow Brown had in her &s;mall garden one apple-tree particularly &s;ine; it was a Red&s;treak, &s;o tempting and &s;o lovely, that Giles's family had watched it with longing eyes, till at la&s;t they re&s;olved on a plan for carrying off all this &s;ine fruit in their bags. But it was a nice point to manage. The tree &s;tood directly under her chamber-window, &s;o that there was &s;ome danger that &s;he might &s;pie them at the work. They therefore determined to wait till the next Sunday morning, when they knew &s;he would not fail to be at church. Sunday came, and during &s;ervice Giles attended. It was a lone hou&s;e, as I &s;aid before, and the re&s;t of the pari&s;h were &s;afe at church. In a trice the tree was cleared, the bags were filled, the a&s;&s;es were whipt, the thieves were off, the coa&s;t was clear, and all was &s;afe and quiet by the time the &s;ermon was over.</P>
<P>Unluckily, however, it happened that this tree was &s;o beautiful and the fruit &s;o &s;ine, that the people as they u&s;ed to pa&s;s to and from church, were very apt to &s;top and admire Widow Brown's Red&s;treaks; and &s;ome of the farmers rather envied her, that, in that &s;carce &s;ea&s;on,
<PB N="67" REF="035296_0161_1001C08BDE2FF760">when they hardly expected to make a pye out of a large orchard, &s;he was likely to make cider from a &s;ingle tree. I am afraid, indeed, if I mu&s;t &s;peak out, &s;he her&s;elf rather &s;et her heart too much upon this tree, and had felt as much pride as gratitude to a good providence for it; but this failing of her's was no excu&s;e for Gil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s. The covetou&s;ne&s;s of this thief had for once got the bet|ter of his caution; the tree was too completely &s;tripped though the younge&s;t boy Dick did beg hard that his fa|ther would leave the poor old woman enough for a few dumplings, and when Giles ordered Dick in his turn to &s;hake the tree, the boy did it &s;o gently that hardly any apples fell, for which he got a good &s;hake of the &s;tick with which the old man was beating down the apples.</P>
<P>The neighbors, on their return from church, &s;topped as u&s;ual, but it was not, alas! to admire the apples, for apples there were none left; but to lament the robbery and con&s;ole the widow: meantime the Red &s;treaks were &s;afely lodged in Giles's hovel, under a few bun|dles of hay which he had contrived to pull from the farmers mow the night before, for the u&s;e of his jack|a&s;&s;es. Such a &s;tir, however, began to be made about the widow's apple-tree, that Giles, who knew how much his character laid him open to &s;u&s;picion, as &s;oon as he &s;aw the people &s;afe in church again in the afternoon, ordered his boys to carry each a hatful of the apples, and thru&s;t them in at a little ca&s;ement window which happened to be open in the hou&s;e of Samuel Price, a very hone&s;t carpenter in that pari&s;h, who was at church with his whole family. Giles's plan, by this contri|vance, was to lay the theft on Price's &s;ons, in ca&s;e the thing &s;hould come to be further enquired into. Here Dick put in a word, and begged and prayed his father not to force them to carry the apples to Price's. But all that he got by his begging, was &s;uch a knock as had nearly laid him on the earth.&mdash;"What, you cowardly ra&s;cal," &s;aid Giles, "you will go and peach I &s;uppo&s;e,
<PB N="68" REF="035296_0162_1001C08EEEC530B8">and get your father &s;ent to gaol." Poor Widow Brown, though her trouble had made her &s;till weaker than &s;he was, went to church again in the afternoon; indeed &s;he rightly thought that trouble was a new rea|&s;on why &s;he ought to go. During this &s;ervice &s;he tried with all her might not to think of her Red&s;treaks, and whenever they would come into her head &s;he took up her prayer book directly, and &s;o &s;he forgot them a little, and indeed &s;he found her&s;elf much ea&s;ier when &s;he came out of the church than when &s;he went in. Now it happened oddly enough, that on that Sunday, of all the Sundays in the year, &s;he &s;hould call in to re&s;t a lit|tle at Samuel Price's, to tell over again the lamentable &s;tory of the apples, and to con&s;ult with him how the thief might be brought to ju&s;tice. But, O reader! gue&s;s if you can, for I am &s;ure I cannot tell you, what was her &s;urpri&s;e, when on going into Samuel Price's kitch|en &s;he &s;aw her own Red&s;treaks lying in the window! The apples were of a &s;ort too remarkable for color, &s;hape, and &s;ize to be mi&s;taken. There was not &s;uch another tree in the pari&s;h. Widow Brown immediate|ly &s;creamed out, "la&s;s-a-day! as &s;ure as can be here are my Red&s;treaks; I could &s;wear to them in any court." Samuel Price who believed his &s;ons to be as hone&s;t as him&s;elf, was &s;hocked and troubled at the &s;ight. He knew he had no Red&s;treaks of his own; he knew there were no apples in the window when he went to church. He did verily believe them to be the widow's. But how they came there he could not po&s;&s;ibly gue&s;s. He called for Tom, the only one of his &s;ons who now liv|ed at home. Tom was at the Sunday &s;chool, which he had never once mi&s;&s;ed &s;ince Mr. Wil&s;on the mini&s;ter had &s;et up one in the pari&s;h. Was &s;uch a boy likely to do &s;uch a deed?</P>
<P>A croud was by this time got about Price's door, a|mong which was Giles and his boys, who had already taken care to &s;pread the news that Tom Price was the
<PB N="69" REF="035296_0163_1001A34D5F0596E0">thief. Mo&s;t people were unwilling to believe it. His character was very good, but appearances were &s;trong|ly again&s;t him. Mr. Wil&s;on, who had &s;taid to chri&s;ten a child, now came in. He was much concerned that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Price, the be&s;t boy in his &s;chool, &s;hould &s;tand ac|cu&s;ed of &s;uch a crime. He &s;ent for the boy, examined and cro&s;s examined him. No marks of guilt appeared. But &s;till though he pleaded <HI>not guilty,</HI> there lay the Red&s;treaks in his father's window. All the idle fellows in the place, who were likely to have committed &s;uch a theft them&s;elves, fell with great vengeance on poor Tom. The wicked &s;eldom give any quarter. "This is one of your &s;anctified ones!" cried they. "This was all the good that Sunday &s;chools did! For their parts they never &s;aw any good come by religion. Sunday was the only day for a little pa&s;time, and if poor boys mu&s;t be &s;hut up with their godly books when they ought to be out taking a little plea&s;ure, it was no wonder they made them&s;elves amends by &s;uch tricks." Another &s;aid, he &s;hould like to &s;ee Par&s;on Wil&s;on's righteous one well whipped. A third hoped he would be clapped in the &s;tocks for a young hypocrite as he was, while old Giles, who thought to avoid &s;u&s;picion by being more violent than the re&s;t, declared, that "he hoped the young dog would be tran&s;ported for life."</P>
<P>Mr. Wil&s;on was too wi&s;e and too ju&s;t to proceed a|gain&s;t Tom without full proof. He declared the crime was a very heavy one, and he feared that heavy mu&s;t be the puni&s;hment. Tom, who knew his own inno|cence, earne&s;tly prayed to God that it might be made to appear as clear as the noon-day, and very fervent were his &s;ecret devotions on that night.</P>
<P>Black Giles pa&s;&s;ed his night in a very different man|ner. He &s;et off as &s;oon as it was dark with his &s;ons and their jack-a&s;&s;es laden with their &s;tolen goods. As &s;uch a cry was rai&s;ed about the apples, he did not think it &s;afe to keep them longer at home, but re&s;olved to go
<PB N="70" REF="035296_0164_1001C09125B0C9D8">and &s;ell them at the next town; borrowing without leave, a lame colt out of the moor to a&s;&s;i&s;t in carrying off his booty.</P>
<P>Giles and his elde&s;t &s;ons had rare &s;port all the way in thinking, that while they were enjoying the profit of their plunder, Tom Price would be whipped round the market place at lea&s;t, if not &s;ent beyond &s;ea. But the younger boy, Dick, who had naturally a tender heart, though hardened by his long familiarity with &s;in, could not help crying when he thought that Tom Price might perhaps be tran&s;ported for a crime which he him|&s;elf had helped to commit. He had no compunction a|bout the robbery, for he had not been in&s;tructed in the great principles of truth and ju&s;tice. Nor would he, therefore, perhaps, have had much remor&s;e about accu|&s;ing an innocent boy. But tho' utterly devoid of prin|ciple, he had &s;ome remains of natural feeling and of gratitude. Tom Price had often given him a bit of his own bread and chee&s;e; and once, when Dick was like to be drowned, Tom had jumped into the pond with his clothes on, and &s;aved his life when he was ju&s;t &s;ink|ing: the remembrance of all this made his heart heavy. He &s;aid nothing: as he trotted barefoot after the a&s;&s;es, he heard his father and brothers laugh at having out|witted the godly ones; and he grieved to think how poor Tom would &s;uffer for his wickedne&s;s, yet fear kept him &s;ilent; they called him &s;ulky dog, and la&s;hed the a&s;&s;es till, they bled.</P>
<P>In the mean time Tom Price kept up his &s;pirits as well as he could. He worked hard all day, and prayed heartily night and morning. "It is true," &s;aid he to him&s;elf, "I am not guilty of this &s;in; but let this ac|cu&s;ation &s;et me on examining my&s;elf, and truly repent|ing of all my other &s;ins, for I found enough to repent of, though I thank God I did not &s;teal tho&s;e apples."</P>
<P>At length Sunday came. Tom went to &s;chool as u|&s;ual. As &s;oon as he walked in there was a deal of
<PB N="71" REF="035296_0165_1001C09700099CF0">whi&s;pering and laughing among the wor&s;t of the boys; and he overheard them &s;ay, "who would have thought it? This is ma&s;ter's favorite! This is Par&s;on Wil&s;on's &s;ober Tommy! We &s;han't have Tommy thrown in our teeth again if we go to get a bird's ne&s;t, or gather a few nuts of a Sunday." "Your demure ones are always hypocrites," &s;ays another. "The &s;till &s;ow &s;ucks all the milk," &s;ays a third.</P>
<P>Giles's family had always kept clear of the &s;chool.&mdash;Dick, indeed, had &s;ometimes wi&s;hed to go, not that he had much &s;en&s;e of &s;in, or de&s;ire after goodne&s;s, but he thought if he could once read, he might ri&s;e in the world, and not be forced to drive a&s;&s;es all his life.&mdash;Through this whole Saturday night he could not &s;leep. He longed to know what would be done to Tom. He began to wi&s;h to go to &s;chool, but he had not courage; &s;in is very cowardly; &s;o on the Sunday morning he went and &s;at him&s;elf down under the church wall. Mr. Wil&s;on pa&s;&s;ed by. It was not his way to reject the mo&s;t wicked, till he had tried every means to bring them e|ver, and even then he pitied and prayed for them. He had indeed long left off talking to Giles's &s;ons; but &s;ee|ing Dick &s;itting by him&s;elf, he once more &s;poke to him, de&s;ired him to leave off his vagabond life, and go with him into the &s;chool. The boy hung down his head, but made no an&s;wer. He did not, however, either ri&s;e up and run away, or look &s;ulky, as he u&s;ed to do. The Mini&s;ter de&s;ired him once more. "Sir," &s;aid the boy, "I can't go; I am &s;o big I am a&s;hamed." "The big|ger you are the le&s;s time you have to loo&s;e." "But, Sir, I can't read." "Then it is high time you &s;hould learn." "I &s;hould be a&s;hamed to begin to learn my letters."&mdash;"The &s;hame is not in beginning to learn them, but in being contented never to know them." "But, Sir, I am &s;o raggod!" "God looks at the heart, and not at the coat." "But, Sir, I have no &s;hoes and &s;tockings." "So much the wor&s;e. I remember who gave you
<PB N="72" REF="035296_0166_1001C098A529A048">both," (here Dick coloured.) "It is bad to want &s;hoes and &s;tockings; but &s;till if you can drive your a&s;&s;es a do|zen miles without them, you may certainly walk to &s;chool without them." "But, Sir, the good boys will hate me, and won't &s;peak to me." "Good boys hate nobody, and as to not &s;peaking to you, to be &s;ure they will not keep you company while you go on in your pre&s;ent evil cour&s;es; but as &s;oon as they &s;ee you wi&s;h to re|form, they will help you, and pity you, and teach you, and &s;o come along." Here Mr. Wil&s;on took this dirty boy by the hand, and gently pulled him forward, kindly talking to him all the way.</P>
<P>How the whole &s;chool &s;tared to &s;ee Dick Giles come in! No one, however, dared to &s;ay what he thought. The bu&s;ine&s;s went on, and Dick &s;lunk into a corner, partly to hide his rags, and partly to hide his &s;in, for la&s;t Sundays tran&s;action &s;at heavy at his heart, not be|cau&s;e he had &s;tolen the apples, but becau&s;e Tom Price had been accu&s;ed. This, I &s;ay, made him &s;link behind. Poor boy! he little thought there was One &s;aw him who &s;ees all things, aad from who&s;e eye no hole nor corner can hide the &s;inner.</P>
<P>It was the cu&s;tom in that &s;chool for the ma&s;ter, who was a good and wi&s;e man, to mark down in his pocket book all the events of the week, that he might turn them to &s;ome account in his Sunday evening in&s;truc|tions, &s;uch as any u&s;eful &s;tory in the new&s;paper, any account of boys being drowned as they were out in a plea&s;ure boat on Sundays; any &s;udden death in the pa|ri&s;h, or any other remarkable vi&s;itation of Providence, in&s;omuch, that many young people of the place, who did not belong to the &s;chool, and many parents al&s;o, u&s;ed to drop in for an hour on a Sunday evening, when they were &s;ure to hear &s;omething profitable. The Mi|ni&s;ter greatly approved this practice, and often called in
<PB N="73" REF="035296_0167_1001C09B52D22168">him&s;elf, which was a great &s;upport to the ma&s;ter, and encouragement to the people.</P>
<P>The ma&s;ter had taken a deep concern in the &s;tory of widow Brown's apple-tree. He could not believe Tom Price was guilty, nor dared he pronounce him innocent; but he re&s;olved to turn the in&s;tructions of the pre&s;ent evening to this &s;ubject. He began thus; "My Dear boys, however light &s;ome of you may make of robbing an orchard, yet I have often told you there is no &s;uch thing as a little &s;in, if it be wilful or habitu|al. I wi&s;h now to explain to you al&s;o, that there is hardly &s;uch a thing as a &s;ingle, &s;olitary &s;in. You know I teach you not merely to repeat the commandments as an exerci&s;e for your memory, but as a rule for your conduct. If you were to come here only to learn to read and &s;pell on a Sunday, I &s;hould think that was not employing God's day for God's work; but I teach you to read that you may by this means come &s;o to un|der&s;tand the Bible and the Catechi&s;m, as to make every text in the one, and every que&s;tion and an&s;wer in the other, to be &s;o fixed in your hearts, that they may bring forth the fruits of good living.</P>

<P>I will put the ca&s;e. Some wicked boy has robbed widow Brown's orchard. (Here the eyes of every one were turned on poor Tom Price, except tho&s;e of Dick Ciles, who fixed his on the ground.) I accu&s;e no one, continued the ma&s;ter, Tom Price is a good boy, and was not mi&s;&s;ing at the time of the robbe|ry; the&s;e are two rea&s;ons why I pre&s;ume he is inno|cent; but whoever it was, you allow that by &s;tealing the&s;e apples he broke the eighth commandment.</P>

<P>"I will now go one &s;tep further. If the thief, to all his other &s;ins, has added that of accu&s;ing the innocent to &s;ave him&s;elf, if he &s;hould break the ninth command|ment, by <HI>bearing false witness against a harmless neighbor,</HI> SIX COMMANDMENTS ARE BROKEN FOR AN APPLE!

<P>It would have done your heart good to have &s;een the joy of the ma&s;ter, the mode&s;t blu&s;hes of Tom Price, and the &s;atisfaction of every hone&s;t boy in the &s;chool.&mdash;All &s;hook hands with Tom, and even Dick got &s;ome portion of pity. I wi&s;h I had room to give my readers the moving exhortation which the ma&s;ter gave. But while Mr. Wil&s;on left the guilty boy to the manage|ment of the ma&s;ter, he thought it became him, as a Mi|ni&s;ter and a Magi&s;trate, to go to the extent of the law in puni&s;hing the father. Early on the Monday morn|ing he &s;ent to apprehend Giles; in the mean time, Mr. Wil&s;on was &s;ent for to a gardener's hou&s;e, two miles di&s;tant, to attend a man who w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s dying. This was a duty to which all others gave way in his mind. He &s;et out directly, but what was his &s;urpri&s;e on his arrival to &s;ee, on a little bed, on the floor, poaching Giles lying in all the agonies of death! Jack We&s;ton, the &s;ame poor
<PB N="76" REF="035296_0170_1001C0A5DAE3F110">young man again&s;t whom Giles had informed for kill|ing a hare, was kneeling by him, offering him &s;ome broth, and talking to him in the kinde&s;t manner. Mr. Wil&s;on begged to know the meaning of all this, and Jack We&s;ton &s;poke as follows:</P>
<P>"At four this morning, as I was going out to mow, pa&s;&s;ing under the high wall of this garden, I heard a mo&s;t di&s;mal moaning. The nearer I came, the more di&s;mal it grew. At la&s;t, who &s;hould I &s;ee but poor Giles groaning and &s;truggling under a quantity of bricks and &s;tones, but not able to &s;tir. The day before he had marked a fine large not on this old wall, and re&s;olved to &s;teal it, for he thought it might do as well to ketch par|tridges as to pre&s;erve cherries; &s;o, Sir, &s;tanding on the very top of this wall, and tugging with all his might to loo&s;en the net from the hooks which fa&s;tened it, down came Giles, net, wall and all, for the wall was gone to decay. It was very high indeed, and poor Giles not only broke his thigh, but has got a terrible blow on his brain, and is brui&s;ed all over like a mummy. On &s;ee|ing me, Sir, poor Giles cried out, 'O Jack! I did try to ruin thee by lodging that information, and now thou wilt be revenged by letting me lie here and peri&s;h.'&mdash;God forbid, Giles, cried I: thou &s;halt &s;ee what &s;ort of revenge a Chri&s;tian takes. So, Sir, I &s;ent off the gar|dener's boy to fetch a &s;urgeon, while I &s;campered home and brought on my back this bit of a hammock, which is indeed my own bed, and put Giles upon it, we then lifted him up bed and all, as tenderly as if he had been a gentleman, and brought him in here. My wife has ju&s;t brought him a drop of nice broth, and now, Sir, as I have done what I could for his poor peri&s;hing body, it was I who took the liberty to &s;end to you to come to try to help his poor &s;oul, for the Doctor &s;ays he can't live."</P>
<P>Mr. Wil&s;on could not help &s;aying to him&s;elf, "Such an action as this is worth a whole volume of comments
<PB N="77" REF="035296_0171_1001C0AB741B2838">on that precept of our ble&s;&s;ed Ma&s;ter, 'Do good to them that hate you." Giles's dying groans confirmed the &s;ad account We&s;ton had ju&s;t given. The poor wretch could neither pray him&s;elf nor attend to the Mini&s;ter. He could only cry out, "Oh Sir, what will become of me? I don't know how to repent. Oh my poor wicked children! Sir, I have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ed them all up in &s;in and ignorance. Have mercy on them, Sir; let me not meet them in the place of torment to which I am going."&mdash;He langui&s;hed a few days and died in the greate&s;t mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>Except the&mdash;Mini&s;ter and Jack We&s;ton, no one came to &s;ee poor Giles, be&s;ides Tom Price, who had been &s;o &s;adly wronged by him. Tom often brought him his own rice milk or apple dumpling, and Giles, ignorant and depraved as he was, often cried out, that he thought now there mu&s;t be &s;ome truth in religion, &s;ince it taught even a boy to <HI>deny himself</HI> and to <HI>forgive an injury.</HI>&mdash;Mr. Wil&s;on the next Sunday made a moving di&s;cour&s;e on the danger of what are called "petty offences."&mdash;This, together with the awful death of Giles, produ|ced &s;uch an effect, that no Poacher has been able to &s;hew his head in that pari&s;h ever &s;ince.</P>

<HEAD>SOME NEW THOUGHTS FOR THE NEW-YEAR.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Showing how Mr Thrifty the gre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t Mercer, &s;ucceeded in his Trade by always examining his Books &s;oon after Chri&s;tmas, and how Mr. Care|le&s;s, by negrecting this rule, let all his a&s;&s;ai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s run to ruin before he was aware of it. After which &s;ome Chri&s;tian help is offered to all tho&s;e per&s;ons, high-or low, who have a mind to examine into the account of their own lives during the la&s;t year.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN Mr. Thrifty (who keeps that great Mer|cer's &s;hop in London, which has been getting
<PB N="78" REF="035296_0172_1001C0B4A42A6858">on &s;o famou&s;ly of late) was once a&s;ked to dine two days after Chri&s;tmas by his neighbor Carele&s;s (who I have heard by-the-by has been &s;ince made bankrupt.) Thrif|ty an&s;wered, that it was quite impo&s;&s;ible to dine out then, for that he was &s;ettling his Chri&s;tmas accounts, "which," added he, "mu&s;t not be neglected for the world, for I &s;hould never know where I was; I &s;hould not under&s;tand whether I was going forward or back|ward, getting rich or growing ever &s;o poor, if I was to neglect ca&s;ting up and balancing and examining into every thing at Chri&s;tmas."&mdash;"Why to be &s;ure," an&s;wered Carele&s;s, "you have a large bu&s;ine&s;s Mr. Thrifty, and a large bu&s;ine&s;s mu&s;t be looked after."&mdash;"'Tis by my looking after it that it has become &s;o large," returned Thrifty, with a look of great &s;hrewd|ne&s;s, "and if I were not to look after it &s;till, it would &s;oon grow little again I warrant you."</P>
<P>I am per&s;uaded that my readers and I &s;hall one and all of us allow, that this was a very right ob&s;ervation of Mr. Thrifty's, and yet I doubt whether we &s;hall e|qually agree in the following remark, though it has near|ly the &s;ame foundation; namely, that if we hope to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ved from ruin in the next world, and to &s;ucee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d in our everla&s;ting intere&s;ts, it is nece&s;&s;ary that we &s;hould u&s;e the very &s;ame kind of diligence in examining the &s;tate <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;ouls, which Mr. Thrifty u&s;ed in examining the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ate of his worldly bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>There is al&s;o a manner of deceiving our&s;elves in our religious concerns, which is very like that in which they who fail in bu&s;ine&s;s are apt to be deceived. No <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">n mean's entirely and at all times to neglect his &s;oul; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, he merely puts off his &s;elf-examination, or he is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e and &s;lovenly about it. Mr. Carele&s;s u&s;ed always to be of opinion, that a regular yearly balancing of his books was not nece&s;&s;ary. He thought that he could form a pretty fair general gue&s;s at the &s;tate of his af|fairs, without taking all the trouble that Mr. Thrifty
<PB N="79" REF="035296_0173_1001A361ACD4BEE0">took in going particularly into them. It proved, how|ever, when Mr. Carele&s;s broke, that the few goods he had to &s;hew had been mo&s;t &s;trangely over-valued, and on the other hand, that the debts he owed amounted to about five times the &s;um he expected. Now I am per|&s;uaded, that tho&s;e of my readers who never examine their hearts, will, on the day of judgment, find them&s;elves as much mi&s;taken, in re&s;pect to the worth of their &s;up|po&s;ed virtues as well as the number of their &s;ins (which are like &s;o many debts due to God) as ever Mr. Care|le&s;s was, and the only way of recovering from their danger, will be to do immediately what the friends of Mr. Carele&s;s advi&s;ed him to do the Chri&s;tmas before he broke&mdash;I mean to look their affairs fully in the face, to take in&s;tant mea&s;ures for getting at a true and ju&s;t e&s;ti|mate of them, and then to adopt &s;ome wi&s;e and pru|dent plan for their effectual relief.</P>
<P>I will add one other ob&s;ervation. This Mr. Care|le&s;s, as I have heard, did not break through any violent mi&s;conduct: he never was guilty of any &s;candalous and immediately ruinous tran&s;actions like &s;ome others, but then he was inattentive to his bu&s;ine&s;s, and by this mere inattention he was year after year dropping down, with|out being aware of it, into &s;ure and certain ruin: he never could be per&s;uaded to look carefully into his af|fairs, which was owing at fir&s;t to idlene&s;s, and latterly to this additional cau&s;e, that a certain kind of fearful|ne&s;s and fal&s;e &s;hame had got about him, in&s;omuch, that when &s;ome friends of his, who perceived his ignorance of book-keeping, offered, on the Chri&s;tmas before he broke, to lend him &s;ome a&s;&s;i&s;tance, he ab&s;olutely decli|ned it, which was con&s;idered always as one of the mo&s;t unpardonable parts of his whole conduct.</P>
<P>I propo&s;e now, after the example of the&s;e friends of Mr. Carele&s;s, to hold out to my readers &s;ome a&s;&s;i&s;tance in entering into that &s;elf-examination which I am here pre&s;&s;ing upon them, and if they think proper to neglect
<PB N="80" REF="035296_0174_1001C0C2DDC54EB0">the help that is offered them, I can only &s;ay, that I think they really &s;o much re&s;emble Mr. Carele&s;s, that they ought to come forward and take his part, and to defend his character from tho&s;e &s;evere cen&s;ures which I am told that his neglect of a like offer has every where brought upon him.</P>
<P>But let me fir&s;t add a &s;ew more words to prove that the kind of comperi&s;on which I have &s;poken of, is real|ly a ju&s;t one; for many people &s;eem by no means to be convinced, that a man may be ruined in his &s;oul by mere neglect, in the &s;ame manner as he may in his trading bu&s;ine&s;s.&mdash;I will venture to ob&s;erve on this head, that neglect is apt to bring on ruin not in a mer|cer's &s;hop only, but even in every thing. Name me now, if you can, any trade or profe&s;&s;ion in life which can thrive without diligence. Has not God &s;o made the world, as to &s;hew that man mu&s;t be diligent, and that it is at his peril to be neglectful? There is no bu|&s;ine&s;s that will do it&s;elf; moreover, if a man be ever &s;o diligent in one thing, but quite neglectful of another, he is &s;ure to feel the con&s;equence even of this partial carele&s;&s;ne&s;s. If a farmer was to look well to his labor|ers in the field, but not to mind his marketing; or if trader Thrifty was to be always bringing up his books in the counting-hou&s;e, but was never to go forward in|to the &s;hop and wait upon his cu&s;tomers, do you think he would not &s;uffer by it?&mdash;So if a man minds this world only, and never thinks of the next, the bu&s;ine&s;s of the next world will certainly not be done, as he will find hereafter to his co&s;t. Some men, if any one &s;hould enquire into the &s;tate of their &s;ouls, and &s;hould a&s;k <HI>for a reason of the hope that is in them,</HI> would merely an|&s;wer in general, that God is merciful, and that Chri&s;t died for them, and add the like general rea&s;ons, which any man in Chri&s;tendom may give as well as they; and if you were to pre&s;s them further, they could only &s;ay, "I know not much about the matter, I hope well, I tru&s;t
<PB N="81" REF="035296_0175_1001A367F5FFDA40">God with my &s;oul: I &s;hall fare as well as other men do: I thank God I never made any doubt of my Salvation." Now what do all &s;uch kind of &s;ayings di&s;cover, but a wilful neglect of their Salvation? It is as if a &s;hip|ma&s;ter &s;hould let his ve&s;&s;el alone and &s;ay, "I will ven|ture it among the rocks, and waves, and winds: I will tru&s;t God with it: it will fare as well as other ve&s;&s;els." I &s;ay, what horrible abu&s;e of God's mercy is this! He commands us to give diligence to make our calling and election &s;ure, and in this way of diligence tru&s;t him.</P>
<P>It may further be added, that in general we find in all our affairs in this life, that whatever is mo&s;t import|ant, requires the highe&s;t degree of care and diligence: ought we not, therefore, to fear lea&s;t negligence &s;hould prove the mo&s;t fatal of all in the concerns of the immort|al &s;oul, which are certainly the greate&s;t of our concerns? What care is nece&s;&s;ary to keep alive our body: it mu&s;t be daily fed, and clothed, and cheri&s;hed, and provided for in a va&s;t variety of ways; and it is not nece&s;&s;ary to lay violent hands upon it in order to de&s;troy it. If due care be not taken of it, it peri&s;hes of cour&s;e. So it is with a man's &s;oul; it is certainly peri&s;hing if its inter|e&s;ts are neglected and forgotten by him, and it may be as effectually de&s;troyed without any great &s;in, as the body may without any great blow.</P>
<P>Once more I beg leave to add, that it is no proof our &s;ouls are &s;afe, that we feel at pre&s;ent no harm or in|convenience from our neglect of them. Mr. Carele&s;s felt no inconvenience from <HI>his</HI> neglect at the time when he a&s;ked Thrifty to dinner. His bankruptcy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ame up|on him quite like a thunder-clap: his things, indeed, were in confu&s;ion before, but the &s;ame idlene&s;s which kept him from examining them, kept him from know|ing beforehand the mi&s;ery that awaited him. I appre|hend, therefore, that the cheerfulne&s;s of which &s;ome thoughtle&s;s and irreligious people make their boa&s;t, is no proof of their &s;afety, but is merely like the gaiety of
<PB N="82" REF="035296_0176_1001C0CCB2E017F8">Mr. Carele&s;s on the day when he was making merry with his company, in&s;tead of ca&s;ting up his books and minding the main chance, as it is called.</P>
<P>But I mu&s;t ob&s;erve further, that there is one great error which a va&s;t number of people fall into, and by which they are apt to be made very ea&s;y under the mo&s;t complete neglect of their &s;ouls. The mi&s;take I mean is the following one&mdash;they are diligent, as they call it, at their duty: thus, for in&s;tance, they dig hard, if digging is their bu&s;ine&s;s; they write and ca&s;t accounts, and keep &s;hop diligently, if they are clerks or &s;hop|keepers; or they do their exerci&s;e bri&s;kly, and follow orders readily, if they are &s;oldiers or &s;ailors, and having done this their daily work, they think they have done all that can be required of them. Religion they po&s;&s;i|bly allow to be a good thing, but this they &s;ay is re|ligion: nay, to do their work well, is the be&s;t &s;ort of religion, and they de&s;ire to know no other. Let us now combat this error, which has a very fair appearance, and which has al&s;o &s;ome mixture of truth with it.</P>
<P>Pre&s;uming my readers to believe the Bible, I will here, in the fir&s;t place, quote Scripture on the &s;ubject. If to labor merely in our calling, is one and the &s;ame thing as to labor for our &s;ouls, how comes our Saviour to have u&s;ed for in&s;tance &s;uch expre&s;&s;ions as the following? <HI>Labor not for the meat that perisheth, but for the meat which endureth to everlasting life.</HI> I grant our Saviour does not hereby mean, that we ought not in any &s;en&s;e to labor for the <HI>meat that perisheth,</HI> but he certainly mu&s;t mean that we ought not to labor for this only, nor even for this chiefly; he mu&s;t al&s;o mean, that there is a duty called by him "laboring for everla&s;ting life," which is a di&s;tinct thing from laboring to &s;upport our bodies; for if the&s;e things were not di&s;tinct, he would not have mentioned them &s;o di&s;tinctly. Again our Saviour &s;peaks of a man who had been <HI>filling his garners and laying up goods for many years,</HI> who evidently, therefore, was
<PB N="83" REF="035296_0177_1001C0D6259C4BC0">a very diligent man in his bu&s;ine&s;s, and yet this is the very man who is pointed out as one who&s;e &s;oul had been neglected: for it is &s;aid, <HI>Thou fool, this night shall thy soul be required of thee.</HI> I will add another remarkable &s;aying of our Saviour on the &s;ame &s;ubject. He de&s;cribes the general invitation to attend to the Go&s;pel by comparing it to "a Marriage Supper," to which, &s;aid he, when men were a&s;ked to come, <HI>they all with one consent be|gan to make excuse, for one went to his farm, another to his merchandize. One said, I have bought a yoke of oxen, and I must needs go and prove them, and another said, I have married a wife, and therefere I cannot come.</HI> Nothing can prove more plainly than this par|able the point we are now urging; for it &s;hews, that attention to our worldly bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;o far from being the &s;ame thing as attention to religion, is often the main hindrance to it. I am going to my farm, &s;aid the men in Chri&s;t's time, and therefore I cannot attend to the Go&s;pel. I am going to my farm, &s;ay the&s;e men now; but they have the face even to pretend that this is the &s;ame thing as attending to the Go&s;pel, than which, no|thing can be more contrary to our Saviour's declaration. Our Saviour ends his parable by a&s;&s;uring all the people who put him off by any &s;uch excu&s;es, that <HI>none of those men that were bidden shall taste of his Supper;</HI> which is as if he had &s;aid, "You who give no attention to the Go&s;pel, &s;hall have no &s;hare in the benefits of it. You have been invited indeed, but &s;ince you do not come, you &s;hall never ta&s;te of its &s;alvation."</P>
<P>And indeed it &s;eems quite agreeable to rea&s;on to &s;up|po&s;e, that God, who has made man to con&s;i&s;t both of body and mind, is not likely to be &s;atisfied with his mere bodily labor, but that he mu&s;t require the affections of the mind to be given to Him al&s;o. If mere diligence in our calling is all in all, I &s;ee not why a man may not be allowed even to deny the being of God: for an Athei&s;t may very po&s;&s;ibly be led to mind his bu&s;ine&s;s
<PB N="84" REF="035296_0178_1001C0DA77BFAAE0">tolerably well from mere worldly motives, and ju&s;t in like manner &s;ome per&s;ons who call them&s;elves Chri&s;|tians, may be induced to go on regularly with their work, all the while forgetting God as much as if they were down-right Athei&s;ts.</P>
<P>Having thus proved, as I tru&s;t, the nece&s;&s;ity of attend|ing to the intere&s;ts of the &s;oul, and having al&s;o &s;hewn that it is not &s;ufficient to carry on our worldly bu&s;ine&s;s merely on worldly principles, I &s;hall proceed to the main point which is before us, namely, to offer the reader &s;ome help towards a &s;erious examination of his conduct during the la&s;t year; and I tru&s;t that what will be fur|ther &s;aid, will throw much additional light on the ge|neral &s;ebject.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, then, I de&s;ire the reader &s;eriou&s;ly to a&s;k him&s;elf, <HI>What has been the ordinary ground and motive of his actions during the last year?</HI> You pro&s;e&s;s, I doubt not, to believe in God, and you expect hereafter to be judg|ed by Him; but have you in the la&s;t year made it the leading motive of all your actions, to endeavor to plea&s;e Him? It is in vain to think that you have plea&s;ed Him, if you have not intended to plea&s;e Him. How is it that we judge in ca&s;es that ari&s;e between a man and his fel|low creatures? I believe a wi&s;e, for in&s;tance, would not much thank her hu&s;band for doing her a kindne&s;s, if &s;he thought he never intended her a kindne&s;s, and had her not at all in his thoughts when he did it. Her hu&s;band's affection is the thing &s;he chiefly wants, and the kind action is only &s;o far plea&s;ing to her, as it is a &s;ymptom of this affection in the mind. Now all this is extremely rea&s;onable; there is &s;ome nicety, I grant, in the di&s;tinction, but it is a nicety we all very well under|&s;tand in our own ca&s;e, and we have no right, therefore, to &s;ay that we cannot under&s;tand it when God is con|cerned. <HI>My son</HI> (&s;aith God to us in the Scripture) <HI>give me thine heart.</HI> And again, <HI>Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and all thy soul, and
<PB N="85" REF="035296_0179_1001C0E49700CF28">all thy strength;</HI> this is the fir&s;t and great command|ment. Di&s;regarding this claim, we toil, we dig, we labor for our daily bread, without almo&s;t thinking of God in it, and at the year's end we expect him to ac|cept this bodily &s;ervice (though performed with a mere view to our own worldly benefit) in&s;tead of the affec|tions he has required of us.</P>
<P>Now as this is a very great and awful &s;ubject, and as it is one on which every thing el&s;e that we &s;hall add will be made to re&s;t, let us endeavor to lead the reader to dwell very &s;eriou&s;ly upon it. God is that being in who&s;e character is to be found every po&s;&s;ible perfection: He is mo&s;t great and glorious, and holy, and excellent, and bountiful, and benevolent; and he is al&s;o full of compa&s;&s;ion and tender mercy. Has any fellow-creature a claim to our regard? God has a &s;till clearer and more undoubted claim; and if we refu&s;e to pay regard to God, we may on much the &s;ame ground refu&s;e to honor our father, to love our neare&s;t relations, and to render thanks to all our earthly benefactors. They that never think of God, may, on a like principle, excu&s;e them&s;elves from ever thinking of them al&s;o: for is He not our Benefac|tor? Is He not our Father? Is it not He that &s;ends us tho&s;e very friends who are &s;uch comforts to us, and who be&s;tows upon us all our ble&s;&s;ings? Endeavor now to count all His mercies to you during the pa&s;t year. Number fir&s;t all the ble&s;&s;ings that have come to you by the means of friends, and all your various family com|forts; the&s;e all have proceeded originally from God: Think next of the &s;ucce&s;s which you may have had in your calling. It is not your own hand that has gotten you the guineas which perhaps you have been lately numbering&mdash;It is the Lord. Think next of the health you have had, and the degree of freedom from bodily pain. It is God al&s;o that defends us <HI>from the noisome pestilence, from the arrow that flieth by night, and from the pestilence that walketh at noon-day.</HI> Again, think
<PB N="86" REF="035296_0180_1001C0E6872FEF70">of the dangers of other kinds which you may in the la&s;t year have e&s;caped, whether from &s;ecret enemies or open violence: the dangers to your per&s;on, to your proper|ty, and to your reputation. Why is it that you are alive and well, and in &s;o much &s;ecurity, at the year's end? It is becau&s;e the Lord hath been with you by night and by day, to watch over you, and guard and protect you, and keep you from evil. To the&s;e mer|cies, if you add your own particular and &s;pecial mer|cies, and if you add, moreover, all the infinite ble&s;&s;ings of the go&s;pel, &s;uch as the promi&s;e of the forgivene&s;s of &s;ins, through Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and the hope of everla&s;t|ing life, &s;urely you mu&s;t own that the Lord's goodne&s;s is va&s;t and un&s;peakable, and that his mercies are over all his works, and that they are more in number than the hairs of your head, and as the &s;ands on the &s;ea|&s;hore, innumerable. Do you not now, therefore, be|gin to &s;ee the nature of your obligation to him, and the rea&s;onablene&s;s of endeavoring to plea&s;e a Being who is thus great and good al&s;o? What becomes, then, of that ob&s;ervation, &s;o plau&s;ible to an irreligious mind, namely, that if we have but done our work regularly, we have fulfilled our duty, even though God has not been thought of in it? Surely it is an ob&s;ervation full of ba&s;ene&s;s and ingratitude. I believe no man, who loves his family and friends, forbears to think of them now and then, while his hand is at its labor; and why are not our thoughts to a&s;cend in like manner to God, as the great father of mercies, while the day's bu&s;ine&s;s is going forward; and why may not the de&s;ire to plea&s;e Him well in all things, form the very motive and &s;pur to all our indu&s;try? Has this, then, been the ground and motive of your diligence during the la&s;t year? This is the fir&s;t que&s;tion that is propo&s;ed to you.</P>
<P>When this duty of regarding God in all things is well &s;ettled and under&s;tood (a duty which, by-the-by, is of all duties the &s;tronge&s;t and cleare&s;t) then it be|comes
<PB N="87" REF="035296_0181_1001C0EC7A2A84A8">ea&s;y to prove a number of further points, which are apt otherwi&s;e to be neglected; as for in&s;tance, <HI>the obliga|tion to worship God in public and in secret.</HI> If we &s;eel that regard to God which has been &s;poken of, we &s;hall be naturally, as it were, di&s;po&s;ed to pray to him. If we feel the obligations that have been mentioned, we &s;hall be ready to kneel down and thank him; and if we are &s;en&s;ible that it is He who not only &s;upplies our wants, but al&s;o forgives us our &s;ins, and likewi&s;e that it is by Him alone, as the Scripture tells us, that we are enabled to think a good thought, and to fulfil any one duty aright, it follows that we &s;hall be con|tinually enlarging our petitions to Him, and that we &s;hall call upon Him daily for all the&s;e important and indi&s;p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n&s;ible ble&s;&s;ings. Have you then been thus lead|ing a life of dependance on God, and truly devout pray|er to Him, both in the public congregation, in your fa|mily, and in &s;ecret, during the la&s;t year?</P>
<P>When this duty to God is well under&s;tood, then the &s;in of <HI>neglecting the Sabbath</HI> begins to &s;eem very plain al&s;o. This is that day which has been mercifully &s;et apart for religious u&s;es, it therefore is the day for more particular and earne&s;t prayer in private and in public, and al&s;o for more regular &s;elf-examination than can always take place on other days; and it may be re|marked, that as on every Sunday we ought to call our|&s;elves to account for our behaviour during the week, &s;o at the year's end it may be proper to take our&s;elves to ta&s;k for all our conduct on the Sabbaths; for if they have been neglected, it is more than probable that our whole duty has been neglected by us.</P>
<P>We will next &s;peak of <HI>reading the Scriptures.</HI> The difu&s;e of this practice ari&s;es from the &s;ame cau&s;e which we have before referred to, namely the want of a due regard to God. Many of tho&s;e who are mo&s;t negli|gent in this point, neverthele&s;s acknowledge the Bible to be the word of God. It is plain therefore that the
<PB N="88" REF="035296_0182_1001C0F602801748">negligence of the&s;e per&s;ons mu&s;t ari&s;e from their feeling no de&s;ire to know what is the will of their Heavenly Father; for if they felt a de&s;ire to know his will, they certainly would take all means of knowing it. If a &s;er|vant had got a letter directed to him which he believ|ed to be from his ma&s;ter, and was zealous to do his mas|ter's will, do you think he would not be eager to open and read the letter? And if we are earne&s;t in like man|ner to know and do the will of God, &s;hall we not be eager to open and read the &s;criptures? I believe it is the excu&s;e of &s;ome that the &s;criptures are difficult to be under&s;tood, and that their meaning in many places is doubtful; to which I an&s;wer, that &s;o is the meaning of all books more or le&s;s to &s;ome kind of per&s;ons. The ob|jection proves only at the mo&s;t, that you &s;hould read for the pre&s;ent tho&s;e parts of them which are more ea&s;y, and which have the mo&s;t manife&s;t tendency to do you good. In fact, however, it is the want of a deep con|cern about the &s;alvation of our &s;ouls, (which is the chief &s;ubject the bible treats of) that cau&s;es it to appear &s;o difficult, as well as in&s;ipid and unimproving as it does to &s;ome people.</P>
<P>We have &s;poken hitherto only of religious duties.&mdash;We will now &s;ay &s;omething of the ordinary duties of life, and if we de&s;cribe them truly, it will immediately appear that even the&s;e are not likely to have been ful|filled in any re&s;pect as they ought, unle&s;s there has been a religious principle for the foundation.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, how have you performed the duties of your own calling in the la&s;t year? Here it may perhaps be an&s;wered by &s;ome people, "We have no calling, for we are able through the money which we have &s;aved, or which our fathers have &s;aved for us, to live without work. We have therefore had nothing to do; we are independent per&s;ons." What, then, are you independ|ent of God? It is the bu&s;ine&s;s of religion to put an end to this fancied right to independence, and to &s;ubject e|every thought, word, and action, to the will of a &s;uperior,
<PB N="89" REF="035296_0183_1001C0FCF6586638">to the will I mean of a &s;trict and holy God. What a ble&s;&s;ing to &s;ociety is religion when con&s;idered in this view! It turns all tho&s;e per&s;ons who are otherwi&s;e the drones of the community, into &s;ome of the mo&s;t for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> able people in it. O, how many troubles and mi&s;eries are there in this land, which, if a few more of our inde|pendent ladies and gentlemen would be &s;o good as to turn Chri&s;tians, (I mean zealous Chri&s;tians!) would pre&s;ently be relieved. What a great number of poor cottagers are there who drag on life both in wickedne&s;s and mi&s;ery, for the want of being overlooked, and in|&s;tructed, and advi&s;ed, and now and then a&s;&s;i&s;ted by their &s;uperiors who dwell near them? Here perhaps a whole pari&s;h is neglected through want of a Chri&s;tian pari&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> officer; there the accounts of an ho&s;pital need examin|ing, or a work hou&s;e is given up to vice and ruin; here a u&s;eful club wants a trea&s;urer or patron, or a declining charity &s;chool is without an in&s;pector, or a new &s;chool ought to be &s;et up? here again a private quarrel is rag|ing which the interference of a &s;uperior, if he &s;hould al&s;o be a Chri&s;tian, might pre&s;ently heal. What innu|merable opportunities al&s;o has an independent per&s;on of di&s;tributing religious books, or conveying &s;erious ad|vice to tho&s;e whom Providence has placed under his in|fluence. Now the&s;e are the employments which con|&s;titute the calling of independent people. Chri&s;tianity brings them to a &s;trict &s;en&s;e of their re&s;pon&s;ibility in the&s;e and many other like points, and at the &s;ame time enlarge their hearts in love to all their fellow creatures.</P>
<P>Well then, have you followed this your Chri&s;tian calling, and followed it diligently during the la&s;t year? Oh! no, you are one of tho&s;e perhaps who have &s;pent the whole year in &s;ome triffling employment, merely to gratify your own ta&s;te, or to plea&s;e your own vanity. The&s;e are the things which have formed your chief calling, and while the vices of the poor have been dread|fully increa&s;ing in your pari&s;h, and the groans of the
<PB N="90" REF="035296_0184_1001C1069E863968">mi&s;erable have been almo&s;t reaching your door, you have been &s;pending your little independent income on your&s;elf and fancying that all was well.</P>
<P>But let us next addre&s;s the more laboring part of the community, and if they will allow us to examine them clo&s;ely, I believe it will equally appear, that a Chris|tian principle is nece&s;&s;ary in their ca&s;e, in order to carry them through their bu&s;ine&s;s with real faithfulne&s;s and integrity. Fir&s;t, have none of you been on the whole very idle during the la&s;t year? Are there none who have &s;lackened in their work becau&s;e they thought the Pari&s;h mu&s;t relieve them whenever thier idlene&s;s &s;hould have brought them to want? Are there none who have cho&s;en rather to burthen &s;ome charitable friend than to buckle heartily to their work? And has every one of you been as diligent ju&s;t after he had got a week's wa|ges in hand as before? Now, Chri&s;tianity will have led you to work at all times, not on Saturday only, but on Monday al&s;o, making con&s;cience of habitual diligence; nay, you will have been ready (as the apo&s;tle exhorts) <HI>to work with your hands in the things that are good that you may have to give to him that needeth.</HI> And how have you employed both your time and thoughts when the regular hours of work has been over? <HI>Which of you, says</HI> Chri&s;t, <HI>having a servant ploughing or feed|ing cattle will say unto him by and by, when he is come from the field, go and set thou down to meat, and will not rather say to him, make ready wherewith I may sup, and gird thyself and serve me.</HI> Thus does our Sa|viour teach us that we are all (rich indeed as well as poor) like &s;o many &s;ervants, who when we have done &s;erving our ma&s;ter in the field, mu&s;t then go and &s;erve him in the hou&s;e. The Chri&s;tian laborer therefore is one who has no &s;ooner done &s;erving Chri&s;t by his ordin|ary calling abroad, than he proceeds next to &s;erve the &s;ame ma&s;ter by his chri&s;tian conduct at home, by u&s;eful conver&s;ation with his children, by reading a portion of
<PB N="91" REF="035296_0185_1001C10AF5C91AA0">&s;cripture to them, and by uniting with them in prayer to the great Father of Mercies for a ble&s;&s;ing on all the family before they lie down to re&s;t.</P>
<P>Again, a&s;k your&s;elf whether you may not have been more or le&s;s an <HI>eye-servant?</HI> If you are a common gar|dening man, have you not worked harder when the head gardener was in the garden, than when he was out of it? And if a clerk or apprentice, have you not made more &s;peed when your employer has happened to come into the &s;hop or counting-hou&s;e? If a footman, have you been as faithful and diligent, have you ri&s;en as car|ly, worked as &s;teadily, gone your errands as nimbly, and turned your hand to any thing wanted of you, as readily as if your ma&s;ter had &s;tood by watching you? Now, if you are a Chri&s;tian &s;ervant, you will have done every thing, under the impre&s;&s;ion that One who is far greater than your earthly ma&s;ter, has been always at hand ob&s;erving you. <HI>Servants,</HI> &s;ays the Apo&s;tle, <HI>obey your masters, not with eye-service as men-pleasers, but as the servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart.</HI></P>
<P>The idlene&s;s and eye-&s;ervice which have been &s;poken of, nece&s;&s;arily imply al&s;o &s;ome inju&s;tice to your employ|er: You have agreed with him to give him &s;o much work for &s;o much pay; but if you have &s;ecretly wa&s;ted in idlene&s;s, or turned to your own u&s;e, a part of that time which you engaged to give your ma&s;ter, you have then robbed him of his due; you have as much wronged your ma&s;ter, as your ma&s;ter would have wronged you, if he had &s;ecretly taken back a part of the wages he had profe&s;&s;ed to give you, or had knowingly mi&s;counted the money in his own favor while he was paying you.</P>
<P>Again, there are many kinds of di&s;hone&s;ty which are practi&s;ed almo&s;t without reflection, and with a very quiet con&s;cience, becau&s;e cu&s;tom is &s;uppo&s;ed to author|ize them; the new-year, therefore, &s;eems a very pro|per time for examining into the&s;e points. It may in
<PB N="92" REF="035296_0186_1001C1100A1B7A88">general be &s;u&s;pected, that all profits or <HI>privileges,</HI> as they are called, which are carefully concealed, have &s;omething di&s;hone&s;t in them, for if they are quite hon|e&s;t, why &s;hould they not be public? The difficulty of breaking through the&s;e cu&s;toms, is often much increa&s;ed by a certain fal&s;e &s;hame, which makes people afraid of doing it, lea&s;t they &s;hould thereupon be charged with pretending to be better than their neighbors. Religion, however, tends to cure this fal&s;e &s;hame, for when a deep concern about the &s;alvation of the &s;oul ari&s;es, a man is carried above all tho&s;e little feelings which &s;o often interfere with his duty, and being obliged to turn over a new leaf in many great points, he takes the op|portunity of rectifying a thou&s;and &s;maller inadverten|cies, which many men of the world, though accounted moral, never think of doing, becau&s;e they have no motive &s;trong enough to put them upon any kind of change.</P>
<P>We &s;hall now name a few more &s;ubjects for &s;elf-ex|amination, which we &s;hall not do with much particu+larity; &s;ince the reader's own mind may enlarge upon them.</P>
<P>How have you behaved through the la&s;t year in re&s;|pect to relative duties? It may not be ami&s;s, at this time of the year, to recollect the names of our rela|tions and connections, one by one, and then to a&s;k our+&s;elves, who is there of the&s;e whom I have either hurt by my mi&s;conduct, or neglected, through idlene&s;s or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ret di&s;like; who is there of them whom I have put off by a little outward complai&s;ance, when I ought to have been affectionate and kind?

The duty &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between near connections, &s;uch as hu&s;bands and wives, or parents and children, ought to form at this rea&s;on of year a
<PB N="93" REF="035296_0187_1001C1145DA946E8">very great &s;ubject of &s;elf-examination, and that which our Chri&s;tian duty dictates, will be found to contribute exceedingly to increa&s;e our private happine&s;s.</P>
<P>Have you al&s;o in the la&s;t year been temperate, &s;ober, and cha&s;te, as the Scriptures require? Have you not allowed your&s;elf to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ive in any of tho&s;e vices of which the Scripture &s;ays, that <HI>they which do such things, shall not inherit the kingdom of God.</HI> Again, have you been combating with all your evil tempers in the la&s;t year, and what has been your &s;ucce&s;s in the conflict? Every man has &s;ome particular infirmity. Some are apt to be &s;tubborn and &s;elf-willed, others weak and yield|ing.&mdash;Some are bold and forward, others too fearful and a&s;hamed. Some are &s;leepy and inactive, others are too bu&s;y and prone to meddle even in what does not con|cern them. Some are too &s;ilent, and others as much too talkative. Some have affections that are continu|ally betraying them into inconveniences if not dangers, and &s;ome have an ungracious and di&s;agreeable har&s;hne&s;s with which they ought to contend. Some al&s;o have much natural pride, or a &s;trong turn to vanity. Now if you are u&s;ed to &s;earch out your faults, you will have long &s;ince known in &s;ome mea&s;ure, which of the&s;e may be yours, and you will be glad to be reminded at the year's end that you ought to enquire how far you have gained ground on that &s;in which has mo&s;t ea&s;ily be&s;et you.</P>
<P>We will only mention further, have you been ob&s;er|vant of the hand of Providence in all the events that have come acro&s;s you in the la&s;t year? Have you referred your &s;ickne&s;s or your health, you lo&s;&s;es in trade or your &s;ucce&s;&s;es, as well as all the deaths in your family, and among your friends, together with every other inci|dent of the year, to a Divine Providence, which has ordered all things that have befallen you. And have you con&s;idered the affronts and injuries of men, the hard&s;hips you have &s;uffered, the national calamities al|&s;o, of which you may have born<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> your part in the &s;ame re|ligious

<P>And la&s;tly, while you are now recollecting all the e&s;|capes and deliverances you have experienced, as well as the affecting deaths and changes which you have perhaps witne&s;&s;ed during the la&s;t twelvemonth in your family, are you led thereby to meditate on the uncer|tainty of your own future life, and on the coming of that awful day, when <HI>we must all appear before the Judgment Seat of Christ, to give an account of the things done in the body,</HI> and when both you and <HI>all that are in their graves shall come forth, they that have done good to the resurrection of life, and they that have done evil to the resurrection of damnation.</HI></P>
<P>To this &s;ubject of &s;elf-examination, which is now clo&s;ed, one important remark &s;hall be added. Perhaps &s;ome reader will have been ready to reply to &s;ome of the &s;trict que&s;tions which have been put to him, "Why at this rate who can be &s;aved? If all this be nece&s;&s;ary for &s;alvation, I mu&s;t de&s;pair and give up the point."&mdash;We would reque&s;t every &s;uch de&s;ponding reader to turn this tract to the following u&s;e: let him avail him|&s;elf of it in the fir&s;t place in order to alarm his fears, and to do away that fal&s;e notion of innocence, which men who never examine them&s;elves are apt to tru&s;t to as the ground of their &s;alvation, and when what he has read has thus convinced him of his exceeding guilt, let it then &s;end his thoughts to that Saviour of the world <HI>whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">emission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God.</HI> Let him proceed to think deeply and often on that in&s;tructive &s;ubject of <HI>his being justified freely by God's grace, through the redemption that is in Jesus Christ:</HI> a &s;ubject the powerful force of which in turn|ing
<PB N="95" REF="035296_0189_1001BF7F893EDA10">the whole heart to God, the reader has perhaps not yet taken into his calculation. Encouraged by the pardon of which this doctrine a&s;&s;ures him if he is peni|tent, and accepting mo&s;t heartily and thankfully its free and unde&s;erved &s;alvation, let him then account him&s;elf to be not his own, but bought with a price, and let him live no longer to him&s;elf, but to him that hath di|ed for him. A heart warmed with gratitude to Chri&s;t will &s;tand in place of a thou&s;and arguments; it will make that labor more plea&s;ant which otherwi&s;e &s;eems intolerable: and it will cau&s;e all tho&s;e duties, which we &s;eemed to de&s;cribe with &s;o much &s;trictne&s;s, to ap|pear now no more than a ju&s;t and rea&s;onable &s;ervice.</P>

<HEAD>A <HI>TRUE EXAMPLE</HI> OF THE INTERPOSITION OF PROVIDENCE, IN THE DISCOVERY AND PUNISHMENT OF MURDER.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By that famous Magi&s;trate, Mr. Ju&s;tice Fielding.</BYLINE>
<P>IN Liece&s;ter&s;hire, not far from Lutterworth, lived a Miller, who having a grudge again&s;t a man, had murdered him in his Mill, and privately buried him in his Garden. Not long after he had committed this horrible crime, the Miller found means to change his place of abode, and &s;ettled in another country, a great way off. Here he lived a long time, believing that his villainy would never be di&s;covered; but this hardened
<PB N="97" REF="035296_0191_1001C127B96D5AE0">wretch did not reflect, that though no fellow-creature &s;aw him, God did, and that though God is patient and long-&s;uffering, he &s;eldom fails to bring wicked actions to light in this world, and never fails to puni&s;h them in the next. Twenty years had now pa&s;&s;ed over his head in &s;afety, and he thought he might, without any danger, venture to return to vi&s;it &s;ome old friends in the village where he had formerly lived. All is now &s;afe, thought he, and it is impo&s;&s;ible the old &s;tory &s;hould be ever brought to light.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t at the very time while he was on this vi&s;it in his native village, by the Providence of God, the Miller who had pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Mill, having occa&s;ion to dig uncommonly deep in his Garden found the bo|dy, or rather the bones of the murdered man. The neighbors then recollected that about twenty years ago, a man had been mi&s;&s;ing in the Pari&s;h, and was never heard of after. Some likewi&s;e recollected who was then owner of the mill, and that very miller being now in the pari&s;h, they all ran to the hou&s;e where he was, and &s;urrounding it, call<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> on him as the murderer of the per&s;on who&s;e bones had been thus providentially di&s;co|vered. The wretched miller was &s;o &s;hocked and con|founded with the &s;udden and general accu&s;ation: and con&s;cience, which had &s;lept for twenty years, was now &s;o horribly &s;tung, that he &s;oon confe&s;&s;ed the fact, was tried, found guilty, and executed according to his ju&s;t de&s;erts.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="observations">
<HEAD>The following observations of this wise and famous Ma|gistrate, being unhappily, just as well suited to the present time, as the time when that great man wrote them, I hope they may be useful to my readers.</HEAD>
<P>That the mo&s;t dreadful crime of murder, hath of late years increa&s;ed in a very deplorable degree in this king|dom, is a fact which every man mu&s;t confe&s;s, and which every good man mu&s;t very bitterly lament. Till this age, indeed, cruel and qloody actions were &s;o
<PB N="98" REF="035296_0192_1001A37D9D1F6608">&s;eldom heard of in England, that when they happened they appeared as prodigies, and rai&s;ed not only the a&s;|toni&s;hment, but the abhorrence of the people. Murder is but very lately begun to be common among us.</P>
<P>For my part, I &s;incerely declare I can di&s;cover no more than one cau&s;e of the horrid evil of which I am complaining&mdash;One indeed, perfectly capable of produ|cing every mi&s;chief, and which hath more than all other cau&s;es, contributed to produce, and to increa&s;e all the evils with which the public is at pre&s;ent extremely af|flicted.</P>
<P>My &s;en&s;ible reader will pre&s;ently gue&s;s what I mean. I mean that general neglect, I fear I may &s;ay con|tempt of Religion, which hath within the&s;e few years, &s;o fatally over&s;pread this whole kingdom, till it has reached the very lowe&s;t ranks of men? It cannot be otherwi&s;e, for when we think of the &s;olemn threatnings of Almighty God again&s;t the crime of Murder, how is it po&s;&s;ible to think that a creature, who believes that there is a God, &s;hould, unle&s;s he be a fool or a mad|man, thus audaciou&s;ly fly in the face of that awful be|ing, in who&s;e words we mu&s;t be a&s;&s;ured is all truth, and in who&s;e right hand is all power.</P>

<HEAD>THE TOUCH STONE; OR, THE WAY TO KNOW A TRUE CHRISTIAN.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Being a de&s;cription of the character of our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour, with an enquiry whether we are like Him. To which is added, an Appeal fir&s;t to INFIDELS, and then to Per&s;ons who call them&s;elves by the Name of CHRISTIANS.</HEAD>
<P>IN this Chri&s;tian Country, or at lea&s;t among the more Chri&s;tian part of it, the duty of imitating him by who&s;e name we call our&s;elves, is a point which mu&s;t be allowed to be clear. I think it mu&s;t al&s;o be admitted by all who con&s;ider them&s;elves as Chri&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">s, that in proportion as a man differs from his Saviour, and turns away from the con&s;ideration of his character and conduct, in the &s;ame proportion does he depart from true goodne&s;s, and betray the un&s;oundne&s;s of his whole Chri&s;tian profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>We &s;hall proceed, without further preface, to &s;peak of a few of tho&s;e tempers and di&s;po&s;itions which mo&s;t remarkably di&s;tingui&s;hed our ble&s;&s;ed Lord, and they &s;hall be the following.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t. He was remarkable for his <HI>conde&s;cen&s;ion and humility,</HI> and for his indifference to worloly prai&s;e.&mdash;He &s;ought not honor from men: he never aimed at earthly di&s;tinction or &s;uperiority, but &s;ubmitted willing|ly to be con&s;idered as one of the meane&s;t of the people.
<PB N="100" REF="035296_0194_1001C3059BA00580">No lofty high minded thoughts, no a&s;piring de&s;ires were harbored in his brea&s;t. He made him&s;elf <HI>of no reputation</HI> and appeared as the &s;ervant of all. It was mo&s;t wonderful conde&s;cen&s;ion in Chri&s;t, who is &s;poken of in Scripture as <HI>coming down from Heaven,</HI> and as having partaken in <HI>the glory of the Father before the world was,</HI> even to vi&s;it this world at all. It was &s;till greater conde&s;cen&s;ion to vi&s;it us in the character of a man like our&s;elves, but the conde&s;cen&s;ion is increa&s;ed to a &s;till more a&s;toni&s;hing pitch, by appearing among us even as the poore&s;t and mo&s;t de&s;pi&s;ed of mankind. He was de&s;titute of &s;uch common conveniencies as even the lowe&s;t have. <HI>The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have ne&s;ts, but the Son of Man had not where to lay his head.</HI> We find him conde&s;cending to wa&s;h his di&s;ciples' feet, and al&s;o warning them not to con&s;i|der them&s;elves as true believers in him if they <HI>&s;ought honor one of another:</HI> at another time we find him ad|moni&s;hing them to be <HI>poor in &s;pirit,</HI> and at another <HI>not to chu&s;e the highe&s;t place,</HI> but willingly and contented|ly to take the lowe&s;t till they &s;hould be called up high|er, a&s;&s;uring them that it was a maxim in his kingdom, <HI>that every one that exalteth him&s;elf &s;hall be aba&s;ed, but he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> humbleth him&s;elf &s;hall be exalted.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly. Our Saviour was al&s;o endued with the greate&s;t <HI>meekne&s;s and patience.</HI> No ha&s;tine&s;s of &s;pirit; no ra&s;h anger or re&s;entment was found in him. His &s;oul was meek and gentle as a lamb: all the trials, af|fronts, and injuries which he met with were &s;ubmitted to by him patiently, without the lea&s;t murmuring or repining. <HI>He gave his back to the &s;miters, and his cheeks to them that plucked off the hair. He hid not his face from &s;hame and &s;pitting. He was oppre&s;&s;ed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth. He was brought as a lamb to the &s;laughter, and as a &s;heep before his &s;hearers is dumb, &s;o he opened not his mouth.</HI> St. Peter tells us, that <HI>when he was reviled, he reviled
<PB N="101" REF="035296_0195_1001C1351A1110B0">not again, when he &s;uffered he threatened not, but com|mitted him&s;elf to him that judgeth righteou&s;ly,</HI> and his own admonition to his followers is, <HI>take my yoke upon you and learn of me, for I am meek and lowly in heart, and ye &s;hall find re&s;t for your &s;ouls.</HI> When his enemies treated him with the greate&s;t unkindne&s;s and cruelty, he returned them good for evil, and &s;ought to promote their happine&s;s and &s;alvation. So far was his mind from harboring any malice or revenge, that he prayed even for his murderers, and recommended them to the Di|vine Mercy, &s;aying. <HI>Father forgive them, for they know not what they do.</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly. The mind of Chri&s;t was al&s;o filled with the tendere&s;t <HI>compa&s;&s;ion and love.</HI> This was manife&s;ted throughout his whole conduct, by the kind attention he &s;hewed both to the bodies and &s;ouls of men. <HI>He went about doing good,</HI> relieving the helple&s;s, healing the di&s;ea&s;ed, and comforting the afflicted. He al&s;o in|&s;tructed the ignorant, and <HI>gave light to them that &s;at in darkne&s;s and in the &s;hadow of death.</HI> The poor guil|ty &s;inner found him a friend indeed. We never read of any &s;inner turning from his &s;ins, and calling upon Chri&s;t, without receiving an an&s;wer of peace, &s;o that our Saviour &s;hewed by his conduct that he came, as he him&s;elf expre&s;&s;es it, <HI>to &s;eek and to &s;ave that which was lo&s;t.</HI> He is repre&s;ented in Scripture as one who was al|ways laboring to promote the Salvation of tho&s;e around him; and when men would not hearken to his words, but determined &s;till to go on in their &s;ins, his &s;oul piti|ed them, and he was <HI>grieved for their hardne&s;s of heart</HI> How fully does his pathetic lamentation over devoted Jeru&s;alem &s;peak the compa&s;&s;ionate affection of his mind! <HI>O Jeru&s;alem! Jeru&s;alem! thou that kille&s;t the Pro|phets, and &s;tone&s;t them that are &s;ent unto thee; how of|ten would I have gathered thy children together, even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wing, and ye would not.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="035296_0196_1001A38908DDFD30">
But his love was &s;hewn mo&s;t eminently in his laying down his life for us: as he &s;peaks, <HI>greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.</HI> This great in&s;tance of love he &s;hewed, yet this was not all: He laid down his life for his <HI>enemies.</HI> St. Paul &s;ays, <HI>when we were yet without &s;trength</HI> (or when we had fallen, &s;o as to be utterly helple&s;s and ru|ined) <HI>in due time Chri&s;t died for the ungodly. For &s;carcely for a righteous man would one die, yet perad|venture for a good man &s;ome would even dare to die.&mdash;But God commendeth his love towards us, in that while we were yet &s;inners, Chri&s;t died for us.</HI> Herein is love beyond example. We read of &s;ome who have been induced to die for their country or their friends, but where have we heard or read of any one, except Je|&s;us Chri&s;t, who has willingly died for his enemies; for tho&s;e who offended and cruelly injured him.</P>
<P>Fourthly. Chri&s;t was remarkable for the mo&s;t per|fect <HI>obedience and re&s;ignation to the will of God.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I came down from heaven,</HI> he &s;aith, <HI>not to domine own will, but the will of him that &s;ent me. And I mu&s;t work the work of him that &s;ent me while it is day, the night cometh when no man can work.</HI> At twelve years old we find him diligently employed in pur&s;uing the great object for which God &s;ent him into the world, rea|&s;oning with and que&s;tioning the Jewi&s;h Doctors in the Temple. When his mother enquired of him concern|ing the rea&s;on of his conduct, his an&s;wer was, <HI>Wi&s;t ye not thut I mu&s;t be about my Father's bu&s;ine&s;s.</HI> He was more intent on obeying God than on receiving his dai|ly food. <HI>I have meat to eat,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>which the world knows not of,</HI> and immediately after he adds, <HI>my meat is to do the will of God, and to fini&s;h the work which he hath given me to do.</HI> And as he was active in per|forming, &s;o was he always patient in &s;uffering what|ever God required. All the &s;evere trials and afflictions which Chri&s;t endured, were endured without reluctance
<PB N="103" REF="035296_0197_1001C138790F3D20">or repining, becau&s;e he knew that they came upon him by Divine appointment. Even when his la&s;t bitter &s;uf|ferings drew near, and his human nature &s;huddered at the pro&s;pect of them, hear with what obedient re&s;igna|tion he prayed: <HI>Now is my &s;oul troubled, and what &s;hall I &s;ay, Father, &s;ave me from this hour; but for this cau&s;e came I unto this hour. Father, glorify thy name. Father, if thou be willing, remove this cup from me; neverthele&s;s, not my will but thine be done.</HI></P>
<P>If there were room to enlarge on this &s;ubject, we might proceed to &s;peak of our Saviour's &s;potle&s;s puri|ty, of his un&s;haken faith and tru&s;t in God, of his no|ble courage in the cau&s;e of truth, and al&s;o of his ardent devotion, as well as many other &s;hining excellencies in his character; but it is the le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary, becau&s;e they are partly implied in the tempers already treated of.</P>
<P>And now let me put a very &s;imple que&s;tion to the reader. Who are they that are the true di&s;ciples of this Je&s;us Chri&s;t? The an&s;wer is ea&s;y. The true di&s;ciples are tho&s;e undoubtedly who mo&s;t nearly re&s;emble that character of Chri&s;t which has been &s;poken of. Tho&s;e are not the true Chri&s;tians who merely call them&s;elves &s;uch. Again, tho&s;e are not the true Chri&s;tians, who, though they believe and affirm the Bible to be true, yet never read it, and know nothing of what is contained in it. Again, tho&s;e are not the true Chri&s;tians, who, though they may read the Bible, and though they can prove by argument that it is no impo&s;ture, are never|thele&s;s no better for all this knowledge. Again, they are not the true Chri&s;tians who have had Chri&s;tian bap|ti&s;m, who attend at Chri&s;tian wor&s;hip, and receive ev|ery month the Chri&s;tian Sacrament, and who are or|thodox even in their Creed, and can &s;ee the errors into which other men fall on the&s;e &s;ubjects; for a man may &s;till want the main thing which Chri&s;tianity con&s;i&s;ts in, I mean he may want a re&s;emblance to Chri&s;t in his turn of character, and temper, and &s;pirit. But in order to
<PB N="104" REF="035296_0198_1001C13A33EAB1F8">bring this whole &s;ubject more di&s;tinctly home to the reader, let us again briefly touch on the &s;everal tempers that were &s;poken of.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, then your Saviour was remarkable for his con|de&s;cen&s;ion, humility, and indifference to worldly prai&s;e. Are you di&s;tingui&s;hed by the &s;ame di&s;po&s;itions?&mdash;Are you willing to drop down from your rank in life, as Chri&s;t did from his cele&s;tial dignity? Are you content|ed al&s;o with a low e&s;tate as he was? And is your heart deadened like his to the de&s;ire of worldly prai&s;e and re|putation? Is this, I &s;ay, your character? Or, on the contrary, are you one of tho&s;e Chri&s;tians who make a point of not &s;tooping to any employment that is judged beneath them, and who are continually aiming at high acquaintance, who&s;e great anxiety is al&s;o to fare plenti|fully in this world, and who, in &s;hort, are in full chace of wealth, as well as reputation, honor, and preferment? This is one te&s;t by which you are to judge whether you are a Chri&s;tian.</P>
<P>Secondly. We &s;poke of the meekne&s;s and patience of Chri&s;t. When he was <HI>reviled, he reviled not again.</HI> His &s;oul, as we ob&s;erved, was meek and gentle as a lamb. Is this al&s;o your character? Has your natural temper, if it is ha&s;ty, been brought under, &s;o that af|fronts and injuries do not much ruffle you? Are you not made violent in your &s;pirit by the violence of tho&s;e who are oppo&s;ed to you? How do you feel, for in&s;tance, towards men of an oppo&s;ite nation, or of a contrary party to you in politics, or of another &s;ect in religion? Chri&s;t died for his enemies; how do you feel towards all your enemies? Do you bear the evils of life al&s;o as Chri&s;t did, without murmuring and complaining, &s;ub|mitting cheerfully to a hard and humble lot, if it be the will of your heavenly Father?</P>
<P>Thirdly. Chri&s;t was full of tender compa&s;&s;ion, and love, both to the bodies and &s;ouls of men. How &s;tands the likene&s;s in the&s;e particulars? For in&s;tance, what
<PB N="105" REF="035296_0199_1001C13EF2D95580">part of your time and money do you give to the relief of men's bodily di&s;tre&s;&s;es? Is your character that of a father to the fatherle&s;s, a vi&s;itor of the &s;ick, a benefac|tor to the poor, and a comforter of the afflicted? Do you like your Saviour, <HI>go about doing good?</HI> How do you act al&s;o to tho&s;e who are of bad character in the world, and who have tre&s;pa&s;&s;ed, as &s;ome judge, pa&s;t all forgivene&s;s? Does your benevolence embrace even the&s;e outca&s;ts al&s;o? It was one of the reproaches ca&s;t on Chri&s;t by the Phari&s;ees, that he &s;tooped too low in this re&s;pect, and that he &s;eemed to take the part of wicked and unde&s;erving people. <HI>Behold!</HI> &s;aid they, <HI>a friend to publicans and &s;inners,</HI> and again, <HI>this woman is a &s;in|ner.</HI> Are you in like manner a friend to the mo&s;t dis|creditable kind of &s;inners? Is the idea of their unwor|thine&s;s no argument with you for declining an opportu|nity of doing them good? Do you take their part and not de&s;pair of them, notwith&s;tanding the &s;neers of &s;ome unchri&s;tian people? Or, on the contrary, does the dread of &s;uffering in your own reputation continually check you in the ju&s;t exerci&s;e of your beneficence?</P>
<P>But the love of Chri&s;t had re&s;pect chiefly to the &s;ouls of men. Are you chiefly concerned about their &s;ouls al|&s;o? Do you do what in you lieth to promote men's e|ternal intere&s;ts? Do you labor to enlighten, to in&s;truct, to invite, and to warn men with all earne&s;tne&s;s, as Chri&s;t did? and do you weep over the cau&s;e of impenitent &s;inners, as your Saviour wept over Jeru&s;alem? Or, on the contrary, are you one of tho&s;e who make light of men's &s;piritual intere&s;ts, who &s;eem almo&s;t to forget that their fellow-creatures have immortal &s;ouls, and who at the utmo&s;t can only be prevailed on to &s;hew a little hu|manity to their bodies?</P>
<P>Fourthly. Chri&s;t was remarkable for his obedience and re&s;ignation to the will of God. He evidently liv|ed only for the purpo&s;e of doing the will of his Hea|venly Father. Is this the propo&s;ed end of your living?
<PB N="106" REF="035296_0200_1001A3E0CF57B818">Do you con&s;ider all your employments in this life as the fulfilling of a work which God hath given you to do, and do you labor to know his will in order to your thus fulfilling it? Or, on the contrary, are you one of tho&s;e who never think of God's will, but go their own way and &s;ay, they have a right to plea&s;e them&s;elves pro|vided they commit no great crime again&s;t their neigh|bor. And again, when cro&s;&s;es or troubles come upon you, do you bear them with re&s;ignation, con&s;idering them to be &s;ent by God, or are you impatient until they are removed, rever&s;ing on &s;uch occa&s;ions the language of your Saviour and &s;aying, "not thy will, O Lord! but mine be done."</P>
<P>On the &s;ubject of our Saviour's holine&s;s and purity, his un&s;haken faith and tru&s;t in God, his boldne&s;s in the cau&s;e of truth, and his ardent devotion, as well as his other excellencies, we will not attempt to enter here.&mdash;Let it be remembered, however, that it is the part of a true Chri&s;tian to trace out the whole character of his Saviour and to imitate him in every one of tho&s;e points in which the Scriptures &s;et him forth as an example.</P>
<P>And now let us make an appeal in a few words to two or three different de&s;criptions of people. And fir&s;t to the downright Infidel. You are one who di&s;be|lieve in Chri&s;t, but are you one that has duly weighed and con&s;idered his character? What is the fault you find in it? When the unbelieving Jews once took up &s;tones to ca&s;t at J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;us, he an&s;wered them by &s;aying, <HI>Many good works have I &s;hewed you from my Father, and for which of the&s;e good works do you &s;tone me?</HI> And &s;o it may be &s;aid to you now. Many excellencies in Chri&s;t's character have been &s;et before you, and for which of the&s;e is it that you di&s;believe in him? Surely you cannot deny that there is &s;omething very excellent and unimpeachable, &s;omething very pure and holy, &s;ome|thing al&s;o very original, &s;omething in &s;hort that looks very like divine in the character that has been &s;poken of, nor

But let us not confine our ob&s;ervations <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> immoral Chri&s;tians only. You are certainly a promoter of infidelity if you do but fail of having that peculiar temper and turn of mind which has been de&s;cribed. I will &s;uppo&s;e now that you are a decent moral per&s;on&mdash;but mu&s;t we not own that &s;o al&s;o are many of the infidels&mdash;honorable&mdash;&s;o are the infidels&mdash;humane, perhaps hand&s;ome in your conduct, and very re&s;pectable&mdash;but &s;o al&s;o are many of the infidels. If this then be all, you have nothing in your character but what is common both to you and them, and an infidel at this rate is ju&s;t as good as a Chris|tian; and if as good he mu&s;t be as &s;afe al&s;o&mdash;&s;urely then there is no need of Chri&s;tianity: and if there is no need of it there ari&s;es a &s;trong &s;u&s;picion al&s;o that there is no truth in it; for to &s;uppo&s;e Chri&s;tianity to be true, and &s;ent of God, as it profe&s;&s;es to be, while neverthele&s;s there is no need of it, and while the followers of it are no better than the unbelievers, is to &s;uppo&s;e that God acts fooli&s;hly and in vain, which &s;uppo&s;ition is it&s;elf a kind of infidelity, and is an approach even to Athei&s;m. It follows, therefore, that in order to defend the truth of Chri&s;tianity, it is nece&s;&s;ary to exclude out of the pale of the true Chri&s;tian Church every &s;uch merely decent Chri&s;tian as I have been &s;peaking of, &s;aying to him (as all &s;erious Chri&s;tians indeed are u&s;ed to do) that you have no &s;hare in the privileges of the Go&s;pel any more than the unbelievers, and if <HI>he that believeth not &s;hall be condemned,</HI> then you, it is to be &s;eared, are involved in the &s;ame condemnation.</P>
<P>We cannot help ob&s;erving that Chri&s;tians of this merely decent cla&s;s, e&s;pecially if po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a little or|thodoxy al&s;o, are not &s;eldom the per&s;ons who cry out

<P>Let us next addre&s;s another cla&s;s of per&s;ons, I mean tho&s;e who are very remarkable for their attachment to certain Chri&s;tian doctrines, and are very zealous for what they call the Go&s;pel. Some of the&s;e perhaps carry their zeal for doctrines &s;o far, that they feel but little intere&s;t in any thing that can be &s;aid concerning the example of Chri&s;t, and are ready to turn away from what they call &s;o merely moral a le&s;&s;on. They de&s;ire to hear of nothing el&s;e than the <HI>blood and righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t,</HI> and his atonement, and grace, and interce&s;&s;ion. But has not the &s;ame Scripture which &s;peaks on the&s;e &s;ub|jects &s;aid al&s;o, <HI>Let the &s;ame mind be in you which was al&s;o in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, and that Chri&s;t hath &s;et us an ex|ample that we &s;hould tread in his &s;teps:</HI> and again, <HI>that he that &s;aith he abideth in Him ought him&s;elf &s;o to walk even as He walked:</HI> and again, <HI>that if any man have not the Spirit of Chri&s;t,</HI> (which certainly mu&s;t include the temper or Chri&s;t) <HI>he is none of His.</HI> A plain Scrip|tural declaration of the character of Chri&s;t, and an ap|peal to tho&s;e texts which a&s;&s;ert the nece&s;&s;ity of being like Him in our own character and conduct, may be of admirable u&s;e in pulling down the vain confidence of the enthu&s;ia&s;t, in rectifying many errors of the bigot, in expo&s;ing the &s;inful pa&s;&s;ions of &s;ome who pretend that they are magnifying Chri&s;t, in proving in &s;hort the faith of all, and in calming many political as well as religious controver&s;ies of the Chri&s;tian Church.</P>
<P>But once more. There are &s;ome who think indeed that they copy after Chri&s;t, and that they copy him the more becau&s;e they make light of doctrines and be&s;tow
<PB N="110" REF="035296_0204_1001C152C2EB3910">their whole attention upon practice. But what is their practice? Are they clo&s;e and real imitators of all the&s;e holy tempers of Je&s;us? I fear tho&s;e who neglect or per|vert the doctrinal parts of Scripture in order to &s;uit their own creed, are prone equally to forget or lower what is practical in Scripture in order to &s;uit their own prac|tice: many take, for in&s;tance, only a part of Chri&s;t's example in&s;tead of the whole of it, and even what they take they lower and deprive of all the &s;pirit that is in it before they can agree to it: thus they may po&s;&s;ibly im|itate Chri&s;t's benevolence to the bodies of men, but e|ven this is done only in &s;ome &s;mall degree, for they can|not be &s;aid to <HI>go about doing good,</HI> as Chri&s;t did, making their benevolence their bu&s;ine&s;s, and quitting their home, like him, in &s;earch of wretched people; and as to Chri&s;t's benevolence to the <HI>&s;ouls</HI> of men, they hardly think of it, and are altogether oppo&s;ite to him in that particular: thus many al&s;o may con&s;ider a certain degree of re&s;igna|tion to Providence in a time of calamity to be a branch of Chri&s;tian duty, and may fancy they follow Chri&s;t's example in this re&s;pect, while in fact perhaps they are much more influenced by an idea of it's being nece&s;&s;a|ry to &s;ubmit to their fate; and as to that other temper of Chri&s;t which we coupled with willingne&s;s to &s;uffer. I mean a willingne&s;s al&s;o to <HI>do</HI> the whole will of our Heavenly Father. Here they mo&s;t l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mentably fail: for do they look upon the doing of God's will, as Chri&s;t did, to be more nece&s;&s;ary, as it were, than their daily meat, and do they count their time, their money, and their labor, lo&s;t except as it is devoted to God's &s;ervice, and employed for His glory?

<HEAD>ONESIMUS; OR, THE RUN-AWAY SERVANT CONVERTED <HI>A TRUE STORY,</HI> SHEWING What a wonderful Improvement in his Condition O|NESIMUS experienced after he became a Chri&s;tian.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">TO WHICH IS ADDED, An affectionate Adddre&s;s to all tho&s;e unhappy Per&s;ons, both Men and Women, who, like ONESIMUS, have left their Home, and have got into a bad Way of living, and who have al&s;o a Mind to hear how they may get out.</HEAD>
<P>ONESIMUS was a &s;ervant (or &s;lave) in the hou&s;e of one Philemon. This Philemon &s;eems to have been remarkable for being a good Chri&s;tian, for the Apo&s;tle Paul particularly mentions his <HI>love and faith to<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">s the Lord Je&s;us, and towards all &s;aints.</HI> It is plain then that One&s;imus mu&s;t have had great advanta|ges by living in the hou&s;e of &s;uch a ma&s;ter; and one would think that he mu&s;t have been a good Chri&s;tian al&s;o. No, he was far otherwi&s;e. He was quite in&s;en|&s;ible of his advantages. Although there is &s;aid to have been <HI>a Church,</HI> that is, a collection of wor&s;hipping Chri&s;tians, in Philemon's hou&s;e, yet One&s;imus &s;eems to have been not at all the better for it. He received no doubt the in&s;tructions, he attended regularly at the fa|mily prayers, he al&s;o beheld daily the bright example of Philemon, and yet his heart continued to be hardened.
<PB N="113" REF="035296_0207_1001C15FF89E8D78">I &s;hould think it probable that One&s;imus was very blind and ignorant re&s;pecting religion, and al&s;o very carele&s;s about it, &s;o that all the &s;piritual in&s;truction he received would go in at one ear, as the &s;aying is, and go out at the other. In the mean time, temptations of various kinds would probably come upon him, and thus he would advance from bad to wor&s;e, for one &s;in common|ly leads on to another, and at length his heart being dreadfully hardened, he would be ready for almo&s;t any wickedne&s;s. It &s;eems by St. Paul's account, that he became an unfaithful &s;ervant, and actually robbed his ma&s;ter, and that he then ran away (perhaps then taking his booty with him) to the great city of Rome, where it would be ea&s;y for One&s;imus to conceal him&s;elf, ju&s;t as it is ea&s;y for a man who has played the villain &s;ome|where at a di&s;tance in this country, to lie hid in London now.</P>
<P>If the pre&s;ent &s;tory were to &s;top here, where then, it might be &s;aid is the u&s;e of having all the&s;e family prayers and this <HI>Church in the hou&s;e?</HI> Why the very &s;ervants you in&s;truct will &s;till cheat you ju&s;t as much as if they were not in&s;tructed, and it is as well therefore to leave them to go their own way, without trying to make them religious. I will not &s;top to reply to this ob&s;er|vation here, becau&s;e, as we go on with the &s;tory, the an&s;wer will be plain enough.</P>
<P>What I have next to remark of One&s;imus, is, that when he got to Rome, he went to hear the Apo&s;tle preach. We are not told the rea&s;on of his fir&s;t attend|ing on the Apo&s;tle. It is not improbable, however, that &s;ome qualm of con&s;cience might put him upon this vi&s;it. Methinks I &s;ee him for a few days o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> weeks rioting in vice, &s;pending freely the handful of plunder which he had carried off, and as his pocket grows low, becoming low in &s;pirits al&s;o. At length his la&s;t &s;hilling is gone. Alas! he has no Chri&s;tian ma&s;ter to &s;upport him, no friend to pity him&mdash;and now having fir&s;t doubt|ed
<PB N="114" REF="035296_0208_1001A395698C1FA8">po&s;&s;ibly whether to plunge into &s;ome new crime in order to relieve his growing di&s;tre&s;&s;es, he bethinks him|&s;elf of what he had once &s;o carele&s;sly hear<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> in Phile|mon's hou&s;e, and &s;ays within his heart "well, there can be no comfort, no hope, no chance of deliverance for me now, but from the Go&s;pel." I think it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s al&s;o po&s;&s;i|ble that he might have occa&s;ionally overheard the name of Paul mentioned while he was waiting at Philemon's table, and when pricked in his con&s;cience at Rome.&mdash; Paul therefore is the man to whom he would naturally fly for relief.</P>
<P>Let no ma&s;ter then de&s;pair of being an in&s;trument of good to his &s;ervants, even though for a time he &s;hould &s;ee no fruit of his labors. I am per&s;uaded there has been many a footman, or &s;table boy, or other &s;ervant, both male and female, who has continued thoughtle&s;s and profane during the whole time of re&s;idence in a re|ligious ma&s;ter's hou&s;e, and who neverthele&s;s has been &s;truck to the heart afterwards, and has profited materially in the end, by &s;ome hint which appeared to have no ef|fect at the time of receiving it.</P>
<P>But we are next to &s;peak of a new &s;cene which pre|&s;ents it&s;elf. One&s;imus is converted to Chri&s;tianity un|der Paul's mini&s;try. The &s;inner is convicted of his &s;in. Through God's mercy the run-away is arre&s;ted in his mad and-wicked cour&s;e. The poor guilty wretch of cour&s;e cofne&s;&s;es to Paul his guilt, and through the infi|nite grace of God in Chri&s;t he obtains pardon, and the hope of eternal life.</P>
<P>Here then is a &s;triking proof of the provi&s;ion of mer|cy which there is in the Go&s;pel. A run-away &s;lave and a thief may become a partaker of it: God can grant even to the vile&s;t and mo&s;t mi&s;erable &s;inner re|pentance unto life; and it is proper therefore, that all &s;hould pray to God for a heart to repent, and that no one &s;hould de&s;pair.</P>
<P>It is plain from many &s;igns that the repentance of
<PB N="115" REF="035296_0209_1001C166DD175F58">One&s;imus was &s;incere. In the fir&s;t place I think we may take Paul's word that it was &s;o, for Paul would not have &s;poken &s;o decidedly as he did, if he had not fir&s;t enquired into the ca&s;e. No; I will warrant you Paul examined One&s;imus very clo&s;ely, for Paul's charity did not con&s;i&s;t in believing in a good-natured way that ev|ery one was a Chri&s;tian who &s;aid that he was &s;o; on the contrary, Paul's charity led him to be careful and jealous le&s;t he &s;hould comfort his flock with a fal&s;e hope, or &s;hould flatter the per&s;on of any one. It made him therefore exceedingly particular in examining the &s;tate of men's &s;ouls: and hence it comes to pa&s;s that the words of Paul have &s;o much weight whenever he pronounces any one to be a Chri&s;tian.</P>
<P>But the &s;incerity of One&s;imus's repentance is &s;till further proved by a circum&s;tance which is di&s;tinctly men|tioned; I mean by his readine&s;s to take Paul's advice when he bids him to go back again to his injured ma&s;ter. Now a fal&s;e penitent would differ from One&s;imus in this particular. A fal&s;e penitent would make a thou|&s;and objections to &s;uch a mea&s;ure. "What," he would &s;ay "mu&s;t I go back to my ma&s;ter whom I have wrong|ed? I dare not &s;hew my face before him, nor before my fellow-&s;ervants. I &s;hall &s;ink into the earth when I &s;ee them. Be&s;ides, where is the nece&s;&s;ity for returning? I am willing to repent indeed, but may I not repent at Rome? Surely I may be allowed to remain here in my pre&s;ent ob&s;curity, for the di&s;grace of &s;eeing my ma&s;ter and all my old friends again is more than I can bear, but I will bear any thing el&s;e; I will live hard and work hone&s;tly, and I will be very &s;orry for my &s;in, and I will continue to attend Paul's preaching. Surely this will &s;uffice." "But go back again in the fir&s;t place to your ma&s;ter," &s;ays Paul. "Go and own to him what you have done; away with all this pride and evil &s;hame which is about you. Submit to the di&s;grace you have brought on your&s;elf, and try to repair the evil you have
<PB N="116" REF="035296_0210_1001C16D5FD94E18">done as well as you can, by working hard for Philemon in the time to come: endeavor to earn <HI>for</HI> him as much money as you have &s;tolen <HI>from</HI> him, and be not afraid of Philemon's wrath, for I will give you a letter to him. This is the proof I require of your &s;incerity."</P>
<P>How wi&s;e and judicious was this advice of Paul to One&s;imus! <HI>Whom,</HI> &s;ays he in the letter <HI>I have &s;ent a|gain,</HI> that is, whom I have &s;ent back again in order that he may confe&s;s his whole fault to you, and return into your &s;ervice. The confe&s;&s;ion of the &s;in again&s;t Philemon was better in this ca&s;e than any general con|fe&s;&s;ion of faith, or than any plau&s;ible tale of One&s;imus's conver&s;ion; and &s;o it may be ob&s;erved in other ca&s;es, that a readine&s;s to go back at all hazards, and to ac|knowledge our crime to the per&s;on we have offended, and to repair it as well as we are able, is the fir&s;t proof of &s;incerity that &s;hould be required; whereas an unwil|lingne&s;s to return implies much remaining pride of heart, a very &s;inful &s;ort of &s;hame, a di&s;regard to &s;trict hone&s;ty, and a fear of con&s;equences that is incon&s;i&s;tent with that faith and tru&s;t in God which accompany true repentance.</P>
<P>One&s;imus, as I have &s;aid, con&s;ented to return; and let us not &s;uppo&s;e that he is now to be pitied on that account, or that any great mi&s;eries were in con&s;equence about to fall upon his head. No, let us congratulate him rather on his right re&s;olution, for I will warrant you, that after the fir&s;t affecting &s;cene was over, he would be much the happier for it, and let us remember al&s;o, that we are to con&s;ider him now as a Chri&s;tian, who has got among Chri&s;tian people, and that he de|parts bearing in his hand that letter of St. Paul to Phil|emon, which I have &s;poken of, and which forms one of the &s;hort Books or Epi&s;tles of the New Te&s;tament.&mdash; How kind, how affectionate, how conde&s;cending does every part of this Epi&s;tle appear, when carefully exami|ned! It is a &s;pecimen of the Chri&s;tian &s;pirit, and we
<PB N="117" REF="035296_0211_1001C172698F6780">&s;hall therefore now turn from One&s;imus's character to the contemplation of that of Paul, which we have here a fine opportunity of con&s;idering.</P>
<P>Paul was now grown extremely old, and he had &s;uf|fered much in the cau&s;e of the Go&s;pel. He was at this very time a pri&s;oner, and it was while in pri&s;on and in bonds that he had preached &s;o effectually to One&s;imus. It is likewi&s;e remarkable that not only One&s;imus the &s;lave, but that Philemon the ma&s;ter al&s;o, to whom the letter was addre&s;&s;ed, had been converted through Paul's mini&s;try. Thus, therefore, this venerable Saint was able to write with the authority that belonged to him both as an apo&s;tle, as an old man, and as Philemon's father in Chri&s;t, as the father in like manner of One&s;i|mus, and as a chief &s;ufferer, who was &s;oon al&s;o to prove a noble martyr, in the cau&s;e of their common Sa|viour.</P>
<P>What then is the ground which he may be &s;uppo&s;ed to take in order to per&s;uade Philemon to &s;pare the poor converted &s;lave that is &s;ent back to him? The ground he takes is this: He forbears, he &s;ays, from that exer|ci&s;e of his authority which &s;uch a one as he might u&s;e; he hints, in a mo&s;t affecting manner, how Philemon him&s;elf had owed the life of his very &s;oul to the apo&s;tle, and he then entreats Philemon, for love's &s;ake, to com|ply with the earne&s;t reque&s;t that is made to him, briefly intimating al&s;o the worldly profit which Philemon would derive from having now a Chri&s;tian &s;ervant in&s;tead of an unbelieving one. But let us quote the apo&s;tle's own words&mdash;<HI>wherefore,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>though I might be bold in Chri&s;t to enjoin thee that which is convenient, yet, for love's &s;ake, I rather be&s;eech thee, being &s;uch a one as Paul the aged, and now al&s;o a pri&s;oner of Je&s;us Chri&s;t; I be&s;eech thee for my &s;on One&s;imus, whom I have be|gotten in my bonds, which in times pa&s;t was to thee un|profitable, but is now profitable to thee and to me, whom I have &s;ent again, thou therefore receive him that is
<PB N="118" REF="035296_0212_1001C174E2A81200">mine own bowels.</HI> And then he adds, <HI>Thou therefore receive him not now as a &s;ervant, but above a &s;ervant, a brother beloved, e&s;pecially to me, but how much more unto thee both in the fri&s;h and in the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>What an a&s;toni&s;hing difference does Chri&s;tianity make in men! What a kind of &s;pirit do we here trace! How &s;trange al&s;o mu&s;t all this love and conde&s;cen&s;ion &s;eem to &s;ome people! A man of the world, who&s;e &s;er|vant had robbed him and run away, would never be|lieve Chri&s;tianity could convert the man, and would di&s;dain to receive &s;uch a kind of letter as I have de&s;cri|bed. I am per&s;uaded al&s;o my readers will agree, that a worldly corre&s;pondent, though naturally ever &s;o hu|mane, would be very far from writing &s;uch a kind of letter as this; and certainly an unrepenting and world|ly minded flave would ill de&s;erve to have it written.&mdash; But how affectionately does Paul &s;till proceed&mdash;<HI>If,</HI> &s;ays Paul, <HI>thou count me therefore a partner, receive him as my&s;elf. If he hath wronged thee, or oweth thee ought, put that on mine account. I Paul have written in with mine own hand, I will repay it. Albeit, I do not &s;ay to thee how thou owe&s;t to me thine own &s;elf be&s;ides.</HI></P>
<P>And now let it be remarked, what a happy influence had Chri&s;tianity on the whole condition of this poor wretched run-away. He was &s;inking, no doubt, into the lowe&s;t infamy as well as poverty and woe when he fir&s;t waited on Paul: he was living, I dare &s;ay, among the dregs of the people at Rome; and if he had remain|ed unconverted, if either he had not gone to Paul, or if having gone to him, he had again hardened his heart, and returned to his former wickedne&s;s, he would prob|ably have ended his days on the Crucifix or Gibbet, or at lea&s;t he would have &s;oon peri&s;hed through want, un|known and unregarded, for he would have been &s;wept away among the thou&s;ands whom the vice and wicked|ne&s;s of every great city are continually &s;ending to an untimely grave: A guilty con&s;cience al&s;o would have
<PB N="119" REF="035296_0213_1001C17A25978CE8">haunted him in his la&s;t hours, and after death he mu&s;t have &s;tood before an offended God, and at la&s;t he mu&s;t have had his portion in that place where <HI>there is weep|ing, and wailing, and gna&s;hiug of teeth.</HI></P>
<P>How happy then I &s;ay, how tran&s;porting was the change! The pride of his heart being fir&s;t &s;ubdued through that ble&s;&s;ed Go&s;pel which was made known to him, he returns to his ma&s;ter. This was a great &s;tep. He returns to &s;lavery indeed, but to a &s;lavery no doubt that was extremely mild, and that &s;carcely de&s;erved the name; for he is immediately received even as a brother into the family from whence he had fled as a culprit, and the &s;ame epi&s;tle of Paul which introduced him to Philemon, would now recommend him, no doubt, to many members of the Church at Colu&s;&s;us, with whom he would become united in the bonds of Chri&s;tian love. Nay, if we believe the report of hi&s;tory, his good con|duct as a &s;lave &s;oon afterwards gained him his liber|ty, and he even ro&s;e, as &s;ome have &s;uppo&s;ed (though of this there may be a certain degree of doubt) to the &s;ituation of a Mini&s;ter or Teacher of the infant Chris|tian Church.</P>
<P>But whatever his condition may have been during the remainder of his days on earth (and it is indeed com|paratively of little moment) of this at lea&s;t we are &s;ure, that his everla&s;ting happine&s;s was &s;ecured, and that he is now numbered among the company or tho&s;e <HI>who have wa&s;hed their garments, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb;</HI> who&s;e offences in this life are pardoned through the merits of Chri&s;t, and who are <HI>&s;tanding before the throne of God.</HI> There the great apo&s;tle Paul, and his excellent friend. Philemon, and there al&s;o the converted &s;lave One&s;imus, unite with one voice in that triumphant &s;ong (God grant that each of us may one day join in it) <HI>unto him that hath loved us, and wa&s;hed us from our &s;ins in his own blood, and hath made us Kings and Prie&s;ts unto God and the Father,
<PB N="120" REF="035296_0214_1001C17F5661DFA8">unto him be Glory and Dominion for ever and ever.&mdash;Amen.</HI></P>

<HEAD>An Application of the above Story to the ca&s;e of tho&s;e unhappy Men and Women, who, like One&s;imus, have le&s;t their home and have got into a bad way of life.</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;tory which we have related, may be u&s;eful to per&s;ons of every cla&s;s, but there is a very particular application of it which may be made to tho&s;e who, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, re&s;emble the run-away and unconverted One&s;imus.</P>
<P>I mean now, therefore, to addre&s;s my&s;elf to tho&s;e who, through &s;ome fal&s;e &s;tep in life, and perhaps by adding one piece of mi&s;conduct to another, have &s;allen into any very di&s;tre&s;sful and di&s;graceful circum&s;tances. I addre&s;s my&s;elf more e&s;pecially to tho&s;e unhappy wo|men, who, like One&s;imus, have run away from their proper home, where once perhaps they may have heard &s;omething of the Go&s;pel, though they did not attend to it, and who are now ruined in their character, who are al&s;o plunged by their growing nece&s;&s;ities into a life of open and allowed &s;in, and are peri&s;hing both as to body and &s;oul, either in our great towns, or among the dregs of the people of our metropolis.</P>
<P>I would entreat &s;uch per&s;ons to con&s;ider a little the ca&s;e of this poor One&s;imus, at the time he was plunged, as I have &s;uppo&s;ed him to have been, in the debauche|ries of Rome, and when he mu&s;t be viewed as a run|away, and even a thief and a vagabond. Methinks he re&s;embled, in a few leading particulars, what &s;ome of you may be at pre&s;ent. Now it happened that One&s;i|mus went one day to hear Paul preach. What if you were for once in your lives, to do the &s;ame? I mean, what if you were to go and hear the preaching of &s;ome faithful and zealous Mini&s;ter of Chri&s;t, &s;ome follower of Paul the Apo&s;tle? I would advi&s;e you, if you think of doing it at all, to go on the very next Sabbath.&mdash;
<PB N="121" REF="035296_0215_1001C180F79EFBB0">One&s;imus, by hearing Paul preach, was delivered out of all his troubles, for he was effectually converted to Chri&s;tianity; and who knows whether if you pur&s;ue the &s;ame means, it may not plea&s;e God to &s;ave you both body and &s;oul, in the &s;ame manner, Indeed, I can hardly imagine any other way than that which One|&s;imus actually took, by which he could have been re|covered; and, depend upon it, if ever you e&s;cape, and are re&s;tored to peace, to happine&s;s, and to &s;ociety, it mu&s;t be by the &s;ame mighty power of the Go&s;pel.&mdash; Would to God, that &s;ome unhappy creature, who reads this tale, and who has imitated One&s;imus in his wan|derings, might imitate him al&s;o in his repentance.&mdash; Would to God, that &s;ome lo&s;t &s;heep might thus be brought back into the &s;old of Chri&s;t. Would to God, that &s;ome Prodigal Son, for in&s;tance, might be per&s;ua|ded, like the Prodigal in the Go&s;pel, to repent, and re|turn to his father's hou&s;e; or that &s;ome woman, who is a &s;inner, while &s;he is reading this tale, might find her eyes begin to &s;tream with tears, like the Magdalen, who wept &s;o plentifully at the feet of our Saviour, and might, like her, attain to a comfortable and well ground|ed hope, that <HI>her &s;ins, which are many,</HI> are forgiven her.</P>
<P>"But what can we do," methinks I hear a whole multitude of &s;uch per&s;ons reply, "We long to be re&s;to|red to all the comforts you &s;peak of; we are charmed at the very mention of &s;uch happine&s;s, but we know not how to get po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it." I an&s;wer, do then in all re&s;pects like One&s;imus. Take example as far as your ca&s;e will allow, from all the various circum&s;tances which may be &s;uppo&s;ed to have belonged to his tale.&mdash; Fir&s;t of all, he attended Paul's preaching, after which, I &s;uppo&s;e, he called on the Apo&s;tle, and told him his &s;tory. The Apo&s;tle, indeed, was a poor man him&s;elf, and a pri&s;oner al&s;o; &s;o that a little good advice (which, however, is a very valuable thing) was all that could
<PB N="122" REF="035296_0216_1001C18377EDC790">be got from him; except, indeed, that Paul being ac|quainted with a number of good Chri&s;tians, among whom there might be &s;ome rich ones al&s;o, he was able to give One&s;imus a letter of introduction, if he thought proper. The &s;ame thing, perhaps, may happen now. If you will call on &s;ome Mini&s;ter of the Go&s;pel, after having for a while attended his preaching, provided he judges you to be truly penitent, he will be induced, perhaps, if poor him&s;elf, to give you a recommenda|tion to &s;ome Chri&s;tian friend of his, to &s;ome capital hou&s;e-keeper, like Philemon.</P>
<P>But, &s;hall I tell you what will be his difficulty? A &s;u&s;picion will immediately ari&s;e about your &s;incerity, and the removal of this &s;u&s;picion is the great thing which you mu&s;t aim at. One&s;imus &s;ucceeded in re|moving this &s;u&s;picion from the mind of Paul; for if he had not, I am &s;ure Paul would never have written &s;uch a letter as he did to Philemon.</P>
<P>Let me, then, clo&s;e with a little advice as to this point, I mean as to the manner in which you mu&s;t give proof of your &s;incerity.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, when you confe&s;s your faults to any one of whom you a&s;k help, do not confe&s;s them by halves. I have known &s;ome per&s;ons acknowledge a &s;ew things which they have done wrong, and which, indeed, they could not hide, while they have been mightily re&s;erved upon other points. They have left out half their &s;tory. They have thought, perhaps, to &s;pare them&s;elves here|by, but, in fact, it has commonly proved, that what was concealed was afterwards di&s;covered, and they have been rejected, not at all on account of any unwilling|ne&s;s to help them, though hitherto ever &s;o wicked, but on account of its continuing &s;till to be impo&s;&s;ible to put any tru&s;t in them. One&s;imus, I warrant you, confes|&s;ed his whole &s;in to Paul, and was not detected after|wards in any little re&s;ervations, or excu&s;es, or fal&s;e co|lorings.</P>
<P><PB N="123" REF="035296_0217_1001C1889D79F1B8">
Again, draw nearer and nearer to religion. Read the Scriptures. Avoid bad company. Attend diligent|ly on the preaching of the Go&s;pel; and endeavor to make acquaintance with tho&s;e who attend al&s;o, and who, however poor, are religious. One&s;imus had be|come one among the little &s;ociety of the <HI>Saints which were at Rome,</HI> at the time when Paul wrote &s;o confi|dently of his &s;incerity.</P>
<P>Again, put away your pride and fal&s;e &s;hame; very forlorn and wicked people are often very proud, and this pride works in a thou&s;and ways, &s;o as to hinder their deliverance. One&s;imus &s;ubmitted to go back to his old ma&s;ter, notwith&s;tanding all the &s;hame that at|tended his return; and you mu&s;t &s;hew &s;omething of the &s;ame temper, if you expect any one who under&s;tands the human heart, &s;o as all Chri&s;tians do, to put confi|dence in your &s;incerity.</P>
<P>Again, put your tru&s;t in Crod. Dare to fulfil your pre&s;ent duty; and do not rea&s;on too much about con&s;e|quences. God has all events, and he has likewi&s;e all hearts in his hand; and he can and will make a way for your e&s;cape, as he did for that of One&s;imus, if you re|&s;elve fully to fear him, and put your tru&s;t in him.</P>
<P>Again, determine on a life of indu&s;try; tor all idle|ne&s;s in you mu&s;t be di&s;hone&s;ty. One&s;imus went and worked even as a &s;lave. I hope you have no objection to go and work any where as a &s;ervant, and to accept even the lowe&s;t &s;ervice. I hope too, you de&s;ire to be a very diligent and profitable &s;ervant. <HI>One&s;imus,</HI> as St. Paul ob&s;erves, <HI>had been once unprofitable, but was now profitable.</HI> He became a mo&s;t valuable hard-work|ing man when he became a Chri&s;tian.</P>
<P>But, above all things, take care to be what you wi&s;h to appear; take care, I mean, to be a mo&s;t &s;incere and true penitent. It is a &s;mall matter to &s;eem &s;incere in the &s;ight of your fellow creatures, when you are not &s;o in the &s;ight of God. The heart is deceitrul. Enter, there|fore,
<PB N="124" REF="035296_0218_1001C18A8C09F478">deeply into this matter. Con&s;ider your own weakne&s;s in times pa&s;t; fly from temptation; be often on your knees al&s;o confe&s;&s;ing your &s;ins, and praying to God to &s;trengthen you by his Holy Spirit; pray to him in &s;hort, <HI>to &s;earch and to try you, to prove you, and ex|amine your ways, to look well if there be any way of wickedne&s;s in you, and to lead you in the way everla&s;ting.</HI></P>
<P>And now, are you &s;till out of &s;pirits and de&s;ponding? Do you &s;till think there is no friend to pity you, no help near you, and that no Mini&s;ter, if you &s;hould go to him, will take notice of your ca&s;e? I will add ano|ther hint on this &s;ubject. When One&s;imus fir&s;t went to Paul, I dare &s;ay be l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">le expected to get &s;uch a kind letter as he obtained. Shall I then explain to you what was the cau&s;e which made Paul conde&s;cend &s;o readily to this poor, repenting &s;inner. It was this. Paul was once a great &s;inner him&s;elf; he could remember a time, when (though he never <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> as a thief or a run-away) yet he was a hinderer of the Go&s;pel, and even a per&s;ecutor al&s;o. But Paul had obtained mercy, and now it became the happine&s;s of his life to tell of the grace of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. <HI>Unto me,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>who am le&s;s than the lea&s;t of all Saints, is this grace given that I &s;hould preach a|mong the Gentil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s the un&s;earchable riches of Chri&s;t.&mdash;</HI> He thought it the greate&s;t honor in the world to be al|lowed to publi&s;h among the vile&s;t Gentiles, the &s;alva|tion of the ble&s;&s;ed Je&s;us. So is it al&s;o now. The very be&s;t men on earth, whether Chri&s;tian Mini&s;ters, or Chri&s;tian People, like Paul, owe all to mercy, and they long therefore to commend you to the &s;ame mercy, and to &s;tretch out their hand for your relief.</P>
<P>Learn, then, to under&s;tand the true hindrance to your recovery. It is not that there are no Chri&s;tians who will help you. It is not there are no means of de|liverance for you, for we have &s;hewn you that "if there is a will there is a way." It is not that you are driven i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">to &s;in by an irre&s;i&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> fate, for God is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">bove fate,
<PB N="125" REF="035296_0219_1001A39E690A5900">and God drives no man into &s;in. It is, in &s;hort, your own fault, and your own fault alone. E&s;cape, then, immediately. Give no &s;leep to your eyes, nor &s;lumber to your eye-lids, till you have taken &s;ome &s;tep towards your recovery. Remember, in &s;hort, that if One&s;imus e&s;caped, &s;o may you; and that if you u&s;e not the &s;ame means, this very &s;tory of One&s;imus will ri&s;e up in judgment again&s;t you.</P>

<P>A Great man u&s;ed to &s;ay that he never &s;aw a crim|inal dragged to execution without a&s;king him&s;elf, "Who knows whether this poor fellow may not, on the whole, be guilty of le&s;s &s;in than I am?" This is a que&s;tion which it would be well if we would all of us put to our&s;elves, when we &s;ee any of our fellow-creatures puni&s;hed; for I am per&s;uaded, that many of us have &s;ins, which all things con&s;idered, de&s;erve the rod ju&s;t as much as the &s;ins of tho&s;e people who endure cha&s;ti&s;ement for them. I am &s;orry to add, that in gene|ral, we are &s;o far from putting to our&s;elves any &s;uch que&s;tion as I have &s;poken of, that we do what is di|rectly the contrary. We contrive to prai&s;e, in&s;tead of taking occa&s;ion to blame our&s;elves, when we &s;ee ano|ther in fault. We immediately &s;ay, "Well, I thank

<P>Never was this temper better expo&s;ed, or the evil of it reproved, than in the ca&s;e of which I am now going to &s;peak; I mean on the occa&s;ion of the Scribes and Phari&s;ees bringing before our Saviour the woman taken in adultery.</P>
<P>We read, that <HI>as Chri&s;t was teaching in the temple, they brought to him this woman, and &s;et her in the mid&s;t, &s;aying to him, Ma&s;ter, this woman was taken in adultery.</HI> Now, &s;ince adultery is certainly a mo&s;t dreadful &s;in, we might at fir&s;t view be ready to prai&s;e the&s;e men, and al&s;o to &s;ay, "<HI>What holy and good peo|ple mu&s;t the&s;e be! wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t haters of &s;in! what friends to God and religion! they, to be &s;ure, mu&s;t be quite pure and perfect!</HI> Alas! how &s;hould we be mi&s;taken if we were to judge thus of them!

<P>How common is it for people, now-a-days, in &s;ome re&s;pects, to imitate the&s;e Scribes and Phari&s;ees! What curio&s;ity have &s;ome men, in the fir&s;t place, to di&s;cover,
<PB N="127" REF="035296_0221_1001C198534482A8">and then to publi&s;h all the faults and infirmities of their neighbors! Some there are, who &s;pend half their lives in li&s;tening to, and repeating all the &s;candal that is pas|&s;ing. When they hear of a man that has been overta|ken by a &s;in, or of a woman that has lo&s;t her reputa|tion, one would think that they had heard one of the be&s;t pieces of news that had ever reached their ears; for how does conver&s;ation run on, and the &s;pirits ri&s;e, and the wit abound, when the fall of a fellow-crea|ture is the topic of the company! The Scribes and Phari&s;ees brought this woman forth, and &s;et her in the mid&s;t.

<P>The words u&s;ed by the Scribes and Phari&s;ees, when they brought this woman to Chri&s;t, were the follow|ing: Said they, <HI>Mo&s;es in the law commanded us, that &s;uch &s;hould be &s;toned, but what &s;aye&s;t thou?</HI> The de&s;ign evidently was to put a difficulty in the way of Chri&s;t, and, if po&s;&s;ible, to &s;et him and Mo&s;es at variance; for if, on the one hand, Chri&s;t &s;hould &s;ay that the woman ought to be relea&s;ed, this would be contradicting Mo|&s;es, and Chri&s;t would then have been called a fal&s;e Prophet; but if, on the other hand, Chri&s;t &s;hould or|der her to be &s;toned, this they might think would di|mini&s;h &s;omething from the mercifulne&s;s of his character as a Savior, and would hurt his credit with the people;
<PB N="128" REF="035296_0222_1001C19E128EFA00">&s;o that, in either ca&s;e, the Scribes and Phari&s;ees would be gratified. What a crafty que&s;tion, therefore, was this! Let us now &s;ee how very prudently our Saviour an&s;wered it.</P>
<P>At fir&s;t, he appeared as if he took no notice of what was &s;aid to him (for when wicked men bring their ac|cu&s;ations again&s;t others merely to indulge their own malice, it is often be&s;t not to lend an ear to them) but our Saviour, &s;tooping down, wrote with his finger on the ground. The Scribes and Phari&s;ees now thought they had puzzled him, and they therefore pre&s;&s;ed their que&s;tion again with great earne&s;tne&s;s. Ah! how little did they know of the true character of Chri&s;t, for he under&s;tood all their thoughts, through that divine pow|er which belonged to him, and his &s;ilence, in fact, was only intended to draw the&s;e his enemies on into a diffi|culty, and to make his own an&s;wer the more remark|able. Our Saviour, after &s;ome time, rai&s;ed him&s;elf from the ground, and &s;aid to them, <HI>he that is without &s;in among you, let him fir&s;t ca&s;t a &s;tone at her.</HI></P>
<P>What a heart-&s;earching an&s;wer was this&mdash;and, at the &s;ame time, what an unexpected one! They that had ju&s;t now been accu&s;ers, were hereby accu&s;ed in their turn. It was as if our Saviour had &s;aid, "You have brought me a woman taken in adultery, and you &s;eem to have been very eager in doing it, and you pretend that you merely want to know what ought to be done with her; I, however, &s;ee into your hearts, and becau&s;e I know that your motives are corrupt, I &s;hall not an|&s;wer you in the manner in which you expect; Mo&s;es as you ob&s;erve, commanded the adulterer to be &s;toned: be it &s;o; go then, if you plea&s;e, and &s;tone this woman; but take this hint with you, that it becomes tho&s;e who are the mo&s;t forward in blaming others to be particu|larly free from blame them&s;elves. Let him, therefore, take the lead in puni&s;hing her, who, by being free from fault him&s;elf, has the be&s;t right to inflict the puni&s;h|ment:

<P>And now, behold the mighty force of a few words&mdash;<HI>they which heard it being convicted by their own con&s;ciences, went out one by one, beginning with the el|de&s;t, even unto the lea&s;t; and Je&s;us was left alone, and the woman &s;tanding in the mi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;t.</HI> What, are the&s;e god+ly per&s;ons gone? all gone? And is the bu&s;ine&s;s on which they came left unfini&s;hed? It is even &s;o. The criminal alone remains, and her accu&s;ers are fled; nor have they fled without rea&s;on, for they had now begun to perceive that there was one ready to accu&s;e them in their turn, and that <HI>all things were naked and open be|fore him with whom they had to do.</HI> Oh, if it had pleas|ed our Saviour to bring to light all the hidden circum|&s;tances of their lives, and to publi&s;h on the &s;pot every &s;ecret &s;in they had committed, how would they have had to blu&s;h before all the people! They thought it prudent, therefore, to make the be&s;t of their way out of the Temple, leaving our Saviour either to condemn or acquit the woman as he might think proper.</P>
<P>Reader, when&s;oever you &s;eem tempted to be &s;evere on any crime or failing of your neighbor, call to mind what pa&s;&s;ed between our Lord and the&s;e Phari&s;ees; they were &s;o bu&s;y in bringing to light the &s;in of another, that they had forgot that they had any &s;ins of their own&mdash;they reflected not that they were &s;ome of the mo&s;t unfit men in the world to take up the office of accu&s;ers, nor do they &s;eem to have ever con&s;idered what was likely to become of them&s;elves hereafter, when God &s;hould call them to judgment. And this is a common evil: God has given to every man his work; each has an evil heart of his own, which he ought to look to; each, if not guilty of open crimes, has many a &s;ecret
<PB N="130" REF="035296_0224_1001C1AA9535BFA0">&s;in that he ought to repent of: in&s;tead of which, every one is be&s;towing his attention on his neighbor's faults, without giving any heed to his own. We are all natu|rally apt to entertain a very good opinion of our&s;elves, but a &s;trict examination of our ways might chance to &s;poil that good opinion, and we are therefore very back|ward in entering upon the ta&s;k. On the contrary, we are very ready to blame our neighbor, for, in propor|tion as we blacken his character, we cau&s;e our own to appear in a favorable light.</P>
<P>But how very fooli&s;h, as well as vain, is all this &s;elf-deceit! We may hide our &s;ins, for a while, both from our&s;elves and from others al&s;o; ju&s;t as the Phari&s;ees concealed their true character, till our Saviour &s;ent them this rebuke; <HI>&s;oon, however, a day will come when all that has been kept &s;ecret &s;hall be brought to light;</HI> and even now, let me remark, that the &s;ame divine per|&s;on, who, by a few words, confounded the&s;e hypocrites, has his eye upon us; <HI>for the Lord knoweth our down-&s;itting and our up-ri&s;ing, and under&s;tandeth our thoughts long before; he is about our path, and about our bed, and e&s;pieth out all our ways. From him the darkne&s;s cannot hide us, for the darkne&s;s is no darkne&s;s to him, but the night is as clear as the day.</HI> Before him lies the hi&s;tory of our whole lives, in which is noted every thing that we have ever &s;aid, every thing that we have ever done, and every thing al&s;o that we have ever tho't or imagined in our minds. And now, if the &s;ame Je|&s;us &s;hould again appear in the Temple, and reprove us as he did the Phari&s;ees, awakening in like manner our con&s;ciences, and &s;etting them to condemn us, who is there among us that could abide it? If he &s;hould pub|li&s;h among the croud of our fellow-creatures &s;tanding round us, all the &s;ecret &s;ins of our lives, or &s;hould draw them up in the form of an accu&s;ation again&s;t us, and &s;hould require us to &s;tand by and hear the long indict|ment read, who is there, I &s;ay, who could &s;tay to hear
<PB N="131" REF="035296_0225_1001C1B0E5D7B6B0">it to the end!&mdash;Who is there, who would not be glad to e&s;cape from his pre&s;ence, and leave him again alone in the Temple!</P>
<P>Nor let us forget that, although Chri&s;t walketh not on earth as he once did, and though he is not pre&s;ent to reprove us with an audible voice, as he did the Pha|ri&s;ees, yet he &s;till &s;peaks to us by our con&s;ciences, and al&s;o by the &s;till voice of his Holy Spirit, which &s;triveth with us: and great is the power of con&s;cience, when once awakened, and &s;et to work by the power of God's Holy Spirit; for then nothing can with&s;tand it; from the moment when it is truly alarmed it begins to di&s;co|ver a man to him&s;elf, and it will then find him &s;o much employment at home, that he will have little lei&s;ure and le&s;s inclination to turn accu&s;er of his brethren. Go now into the chamber of him whom &s;ickne&s;s and &s;orrow have brought low, and have filled with a deep &s;en&s;e of &s;in; &s;ee with what readine&s;s he confe&s;&s;es his iniquity, and with what earne&s;tne&s;s he prays for pardon; &s;ee how en|tirely he is taken up by the affairs of his own &s;oul, and how he is laboring to make his peace with God. Tell him that &s;ome neighbor has fallen into a dreadful &s;in, and how, think you, will be be affected by it? Why, he will lament, pity, and pray for the per&s;on. But if you &s;hould try after the manner of &s;ome profane people to rai&s;e a joke at the expence of the unhappy &s;inner, hoping to divert the &s;ick per&s;on with the &s;ubject, me|thinks he would turn from you as from a man not fit for him to talk with, and he would probably beg you to go out of the room. To proceed one &s;tep farther. Sup|po&s;e the la&s;t day to be now come. Imagine that you &s;ee the Judge upon the Throne, the generations of mankind a&s;&s;embled before him, and the books opened, out of which we are all to be judged. Who, in that &s;ituation, would have any di&s;po&s;ition to revile, or laugh at the &s;ins of his neighbor, or would have any heart to be &s;evere upon him? Who is there who&s;e thoughts
<PB N="132" REF="035296_0226_1001C1B6271F8C78">would not be employed entirely upon his own ca&s;e?&mdash;Who would not be anxious to obtain his own pardon; who, in &s;hort, would not leave God to deal as he tho't fit with others, hoping and praying that they al&s;o, if po&s;&s;ible, might obtain mercy? To this temper, there|fore, it is plain that &s;ickne&s;s may &s;oon bring us, and to this temper, may God grant that we may all be brought before it is too late, &s;ince death and judgment will mo&s;t a&s;&s;uredly bring us to it at la&s;t.</P>
<P>Our Saviour having thus di&s;patched the Phari&s;ees, the woman alone remains: &s;he was detained in the Tem|ple by the &s;ame cau&s;e which made the others depart&mdash;I mean con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of guilt. This kept her fixed to the &s;pot even after her accu&s;ers were gone, expecting now to hear her &s;entence pronounced by Chri&s;t; who, at length, rai&s;ed him&s;elf from the ground, on which he had been writing, &s;ays to the woman, <HI>where are tho&s;e thine accu&s;ers? Hath no man condemned thee? She &s;aid, no man, Lord. And Je&s;us &s;aid unto her, neither do I condemn thee; go, and &s;in no more.</HI></P>
<P>Let us not be led by this la&s;t &s;peech of Chri&s;t, to &s;up|po&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">t he meant either to make light of the &s;in, or to &s;ay any thing again&s;t the law of God. No, let us take occa&s;ion rather in this place to remark how very dreadful a crime adultery is con&s;idered by our Creator, &s;ince he ordered it in the Old Te&s;tament to be puni&s;h|ed even with death. This puni&s;hment, however, was not to be inflicted, except after regular proof; an accu|&s;er and &s;ufficient witne&s;&s;es mu&s;t come forward in every &s;uch ca&s;e; the proper Judge or Magi&s;trate mu&s;t al&s;o hear the cau&s;e, and mu&s;t him&s;elf pronounce the &s;entence. If all the&s;e nece&s;&s;ary rules had been complied with, Chri&s;t would not have thought of &s;topping the due cour&s;e of law, for he was not u&s;ed to meddle with the civil power, nor is there any in&s;tance of his &s;howing forth his mercy by &s;aving a criminal out of the hands of public ju&s;tice. In the pre&s;ent in&s;tance no kind of trial
<PB N="133" REF="035296_0227_1001C1BE10939760">had been had; on the contrary, the accu&s;ers and wit|ne&s;&s;es were all fled; this woman, therefore, not being accu&s;ed by tho&s;e who&s;e office it was to accu&s;e her, was not accu&s;ed by Chri&s;t neither, who&s;e office it certainly was not. On another occa&s;ion, when Chri&s;t was ap|pealed to by one who &s;eems to have been wronged in his property, he made an&s;wer, <HI>man, who made me a judge and a divider.</HI> Our Saviour came into the world not to &s;ettle di&s;putes about property, nor to meddle in ca&s;es of common criminal ju&s;tice; he left all &s;uch things as the&s;e to be managed by the per&s;ons whom the &s;tate appointed for the purpo&s;e. He came to be a Saviour, he came to pardon &s;ins committed again&s;t God, for which he made atonement by his death, and in his life time he taught men how to obtain this &s;alvation, name|ly, by repenting and believing in him, and re&s;olving to <HI>&s;in no more.</HI></P>
<P>In full agreement with the&s;e ends of his coming into the world, he, in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, leaves the law of Mo&s;es ju&s;t as it was, neither condemning nor yet ac|quitting the woman; but as the publi&s;her of the Go&s;pel of the grace of God, and, as the author of everla&s;ting Salvation, he comforts, with the hope of pardon, the wretched per&s;on whom the malicious Phari&s;ees had bro't before him, and he directs her how to e&s;cape, not the more puni&s;hment of the law, but the more bitter pains of eternal death. <HI>Go,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>and &s;in no more.</HI> It is as if he had &s;aid, "Be not concerned about the accu&s;a|tion before the magi&s;trate, which has been brought a|gain&s;t you, for your accu&s;ers indeed are gone.

<HEAD>THE GRAND ASSIZES; OR, <HI>GENERAL GAOL DELIVERY.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THERE was in a certain country a great king, who was al&s;o a judge. He was very merciful, but he was al&s;o very ju&s;t; for he u&s;ed to &s;ay that ju&s;tice was the foundation of all goodne&s;s. His &s;ubjects were apt enough, in a general way, to extol his merciful temper, and e&s;pecially tho&s;e &s;ubjects who were always committing crimes which made them liable to be pu|ni&s;hed by his ju&s;tice. This la&s;t quality they con&s;tantly kept out of &s;ight, till they had cheated them&s;elves into a notion that he was too good to puni&s;h at all.</P>
<P>Now it happened a long time before, that this whole people had broken their allegiance, and had forfeited the king's favor, and had al&s;o fallen from a very pro&s;pe|rous &s;tate in which he had placed them, having one and all become bankrupts; but when they were over head and ears in debt, and had nothing to pay, the king's &s;on mo&s;t generou&s;ly took the whole burthen of the debts on him&s;elf; and, in &s;hort, it was propo&s;ed that all their affairs &s;hould be &s;ettled, and their very crimes forgiven, (for they were criminals as well as debtors) provided only they would &s;hew them&s;elves to be &s;orry for what they had done them&s;elves, and be thankful for what was done for them. I &s;hould however remark, that a book was al&s;o given them, in which a true and faithful account of their own rebellion was written; and of the manner of obtaining the king's pardon, together with a variety of directions for their conduct in time to come;
<PB N="136" REF="035296_0230_1001A3A1B44437F0">and in this book it was particularly mentioned, that after having lived a certain number of years in a part of the &s;ame king's country, and under his eye and juri&s;diction, there &s;hould be a Grand A&s;&s;ize, when every one was to be publicly tried for his pa&s;t behavior, and after this trial was over, certain heavy puni&s;hments were to be inflicted on tho&s;e who &s;hould have &s;till per&s;i&s;ted in their rebellion, and certain high premiums were to be be|&s;towed as a gracious reward upon the obedient.</P>
<P>It may be proper here to notice, that this king's court differed in &s;ome re&s;pects from our courts of jus|tice, being indeed a &s;ort of court of appeal, to which que&s;tions were carried after they had been imperfectly decided in the common courts. And although with us all criminals are tried (and very pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> my opin|ion) by a jury of their peers, yet in this king's country the mode was very different; for, &s;ince every one of the people had been in a certain &s;en&s;e criminals, the king did not think it fair to make them judges al&s;o. It would, indeed, have been impo&s;&s;ible to follow in all re&s;pects, the cu&s;toms which prevail with us, for the crimes with which men are charged in our courts are mere "overt acts," as the lawyers call them, that is, acts which re|gard the outward behavior; &s;uch as the acts of &s;triking, maiming, &s;tealing, and &s;o forth. But in the king's court it was not merely outward &s;ins, but &s;ins of the heart al&s;o which were to be puni&s;hed. Many a crime, therefore, which was never heard of in the court of king's-bench, or at the Old Baily, was here to be bro't to light, and was re&s;erved for this great day. Among the&s;e were pride, and oppre&s;&s;ion, and envy, and malice, and revenge, and covetou&s;ne&s;s, and &s;ecret vanity of mind, and evil thoughts of all &s;orts, and all evil wi&s;hes and de&s;ires. When covetou&s;ne&s;s, indeed, put men on committing robbery, or when malice drove them to an not of murder, then the common courts immediately judged the criminal, without waiting for the&s;e Great
<PB N="137" REF="035296_0231_1001C1CE5BE97648">A&s;&s;izes; neverthele&s;s &s;ince even a thief and murderer would now and then e&s;cape in the common courts, for want of evidence, or through &s;ome fault or other of the judge of jury, the e&s;cape was of little moment to the poor criminal, for he was &s;ure to be tried again by this great king; and even though the man &s;hould have been puni&s;hed in &s;ome &s;en&s;e before, yet he had now a farther puni&s;hment to fear, unle&s;s, indeed he was one of tho&s;e, who had obtained (by the means I before &s;poke of) this great king's pardon. The &s;ins of the heart, however, were by far the mo&s;t numerous &s;ort of &s;ins, which were to come before this great tribunal; and the&s;e were to be judged by this great king in per&s;on, and by none but him&s;elf; becau&s;e he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a certain power of getting at all &s;ecrets.</P>
<P>I once heard of a certain king of Sicily, who built a whi&s;pering gallery in the form of an ear, through which he could hear every word that his rebellious &s;ubjects uttered, though &s;poken ever &s;o low. But this &s;ecret of the king of Sicily was nothing to what this great king po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed; for he had the power of knowing every tho't which was conceived in the mind, though it never broke out into words, or proceeded to actions.</P>
<P>Now you may be ready to think, perhaps, that the&s;e people were wor&s;e off than any others, becau&s;e they were to be examined &s;o clo&s;ely, and judged &s;o &s;trictly. Far from it: the king was too ju&s;t to expect bricks with|out giving them &s;traw; he gave them, therefore, every help that they needed. He gave them a book of direc|tions, as I before ob&s;erved; and becau&s;e they were na|turally &s;hort-&s;ighted, he &s;upplied them with a gla&s;s for reading it, and thus the mo&s;t dim-&s;ighted might &s;ee, if they did not wilfully &s;hut their eyes; but though the king <HI>invited</HI> them to open their eyes, he did not <HI>compel</HI> them; and many remained &s;tone blind all their lives with the book in their hand, becau&s;e they would not u&s;e the gla&s;s, nor take the proper means for reading and
<PB N="138" REF="035296_0232_1001C1D0DA4D13F8">under&s;tanding all that was written for them. The humble and &s;incere learnt in time to &s;ee even that part of the book which was lea&s;t plainly written; and it was ob&s;erved that the ability to under&s;tand it depended more on the heart than the head; and evil di&s;po&s;ition blinded the &s;ight, while humility operated like an eye-&s;alve.</P>
<P>Now it happened that tho&s;e who had been &s;o lucky as to e&s;cape the puni&s;hment of the lower courts, took it into their heads that they were all very good &s;ort of people, and of cour&s;e very &s;afe from any danger at this Great A&s;&s;ize. This grand intended trial, in|deed, had been talked of &s;o much, and put off &s;o long, (for it had &s;eemed long at lea&s;t to the&s;e &s;hort-&s;ighted peo|ple) that many per&s;uaded them&s;elves that it would never take place at all; and far the greater part were living away therefore without ever thinking about it; they went on ju&s;t as if nothing at all had been done for their be|nefit; and as if they had no king to plea&s;e, no king's &s;on to be thankful to, no book to guide them&s;elves by, and as if the A&s;&s;izes were never to come about.</P>
<P>But with this king <HI>a thou&s;and years were as one day, for he was not &s;lack concerning his promi&s;es, as &s;ome men count &s;lackne&s;s.</HI> So at length the &s;olemn period ap|proached. Still, however, the people did not prepare for the &s;olemnity, or rather, they prepared for it much as &s;ome of the people in our towns are apt to prepare for the A&s;&s;ize times; I mean by balls and fea&s;tings, and they &s;aw their own trial come on with as little concern as is felt by the people in our &s;treets, when they &s;ee the judge's proce&s;&s;ion enter the town, who indeed comfort them&s;elves that it is only tho&s;e in the pri&s;ons who are guilty.</P>
<P>But when at la&s;t the day came, and every man found that he was to be judged for him&s;elf, and that &s;ome how or other, all his &s;ecrets were brought out, and that there was now no e&s;cape, things began to take a more &s;eri|ous turn. Some of the wor&s;t of the criminals were
<PB N="139" REF="035296_0233_1001C1D780283CC8">got together debating in an outer court of the Grand Hall, and there they pa&s;&s;ed their time, not in compunc|tion with tears, not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> comparing their lives with what was required in that book which had been given them, but in comparing them&s;elves with &s;uch as had been &s;till more notorious offenders.</P>
<P>One who had grown wealthy by rapine and oppres|&s;ion, but had contrived to keep within the letter of the law, in&s;ulted a poor fellow as a thief, becau&s;e he had &s;tolen a loaf of bread. "You were far wickeder than I was," &s;aid a citizen to his apprentice, "for you drank and &s;wore at the alehou&s;e every Sunday night." "Yes," &s;aid the poor fellow, "but it was your fault that I did &s;o, for you took no care of my &s;oul, but &s;pent all your Sabbaths in jaunting abroad or in rioting at home; I might have learnt, but there was no one to teach me; I might have followed a good example, but I &s;aw only bad ones. I &s;inned again&s;t le&s;s light than you did." A drunken journeyman, who had &s;pent all his wages on gin, took comfort that he had not &s;p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> a great e&s;tate in bribery at elections, as the lord o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> manor had done, while a perjured elector boa&s;ted that he was no drunkard, like the journeyman.</P>
<P>I have not room to de&s;cribe the awful pomp of the court, nor the terrible &s;ounding of the trumpet which attended the judge's entrance, nor the &s;itting of the judge, nor the opening the books, nor the crouding of the millions, who &s;tood before him. I &s;hall pa&s;s over the multitudes who were tried and condemned to dun|geons, and chains, and fire, and to perpetual bani&s;h|ment from the pre&s;ence of the king, which always &s;eem|ed to be the &s;adde&s;t part of the &s;entence. I &s;hall only notice further, a few who brought &s;ome plea of merit, and claimed a right to be rewarded by the king, and e|ven deceived them&s;elves &s;o far as to think that his own book of laws would be their ju&s;tification.</P>

Now it proved that this man had not only avoided covetou&s;ne&s;s, but that he had even left his wife and children in want through his exce&s;&s;ive prodigality.

<P>A poor di&s;ea&s;ed blind cripple, from the very Ho&s;pital which this great man had built, then fell pro&s;trate on his face, crying out, <HI>Lord be merciful to me a &s;inner!</HI> on which the Judge, to the &s;urprize of all, &s;aid, <HI>well done good and faithful &s;ervant.</HI> The poor man repli|ed, "Lord, I have done nothing!"

<HEAD>BEAR YE ONE ANOTHER'S BURTHENS; OR, THE VALLEY OF TEARS. <HI>A VISION.</HI></HEAD>
<P>ONCE upon a time methought I &s;et out upon a long journey, and the place through which I travelled appeared to be a dark Valley, which was cal|led the Valley of Tears. It had obtained this name not only on account of the many &s;orrowful adventures which poor pa&s;&s;engers commonly meet with in their journey through it, but al&s;o becau&s;e mo&s;t of the&s;e tra|vellers entered it weeping and crying, and left it in ve|ry great pain and angui&s;h. This va&s;t valley was full of people of all colors, ages, &s;izes, and de&s;criptions.&mdash; But whether white or black, or tawney, all were tra|velling the &s;ame road; or, rather, they were taking different little paths which all led to the &s;ame common end.</P>
<P>Now it was remarkable, that notwith&s;tanding the
<PB N="144" REF="035296_0238_1001C1F1BA4F1408">different complexions, ages, and tempers of this va&s;t variety of people, yet all re&s;embled each other in this one re&s;pect, that each had a burthen on his back which he was de&s;tined to carry through the toil and heat of the day, until he &s;hould arrive by a longer or &s;horter cour&s;e at his journey's end. The&s;e burthens would in general have made the pilgrimage quite intolerable, had not the Lord of the Valley, out of his great compa&s;&s;ion for the&s;e poor Pilgrims, provided among other things the following means for their relief.</P>
<P>In their full view over the entrance of the Valley there were written in great letters, the following words:
<Q>Bear ye one another's Burthens.</Q></P>
<P>Now I &s;aw in my vi&s;ion that many of the travellers hurried on without &s;topping to read this in&s;truction, and others, though they had once read it, yet paid little or no attention to it. A third &s;ort thought it very good advice for other people, but very &s;eldom applied it to them&s;elves. In &s;hort, I &s;aw that too many of tho&s;e people were of opinion that they had burthens enough of their own, and that there was therefore no occa&s;ion to take upon them tho&s;e of others; &s;o each tried to make his own load as light, and his own journey as plea&s;ant as he could, without &s;o much as once ca&s;ting a thought on a pool over-loaded neighbor. Here, however, I have to make a rather &s;ingular remark, by which I &s;hall plainly &s;hew the folly of the&s;e &s;elfi&s;h people. It was &s;o ordered and contrived by the Lord of this valley, that if any one &s;tretched out his hand to lighten a neighbor's burthen, in fact he never failed to find that he at that moment al&s;o lightened his own. Be&s;ides, the obliga|tion to help each other, and the benefit of doing &s;o were mutual. If a man helped his neighbor, it commonly happened that &s;ome other neighbor came by-and-by and helped him in his turn; for there was no &s;uch thing as what we call <HI>independence</HI> in the whole valley. Not
<PB N="145" REF="035296_0239_1001C1F71131D330">one of all the&s;e travellers, however &s;tout and &s;trong, could move on comfortably without a&s;&s;i&s;tance, for &s;o the Lord of the Valley, who&s;e laws were all of them kind and good, had expre&s;sly ordained.</P>
<P>I &s;tood &s;till to watch the progre&s;s of the&s;e poor way|faring people, who moved &s;lowly on, like &s;o many tick|et porters, with burthens of various kinds on their backs; of which &s;ome were heavier, and &s;ome were lighter, but from a burthen of one kind or other, not one traveller was entirely free.</P>

<P>A &s;orrowful widow, oppre&s;&s;ed with the burthen of grief for the lo&s;s of an affectionate hu&s;band, would have been bowed down by her heavy load, had not the &s;ur|viving children with great alacrity &s;tepped forward and &s;upported her.

I peeped into his pack and &s;aw it was made up of many &s;ad articles; there was poverty, oppre&s;&s;ion, &s;ickne&s;s, debt, and what made by far the heavie&s;t part, undutiful children. I was wondering how it was that he got on even &s;o well as he did, till I &s;pied his wife, a kind, meek, Chri&s;tian woman, who was doing her ut|mo&s;t to a&s;&s;i&s;t him. She quietly got behind, gently laid her &s;houlder to the burthen, and carried a much larger proportion of it than appeared to me when I was at a di&s;tance. She not only &s;u&s;tained him by her &s;trength, but cheered him by her coun&s;els.

<HEAD>THE KIND NEIGHBOR.</HEAD>
<P>An infirm blind woman was creeping forward with a very heavy burthen, in which were packed &s;ickne&s;s and want, with numberle&s;s other of tho&s;e raw materials, out of which human mi&s;ery is worked up. She was &s;o weak that &s;he could not have got on at all, had it not been for the kind a&s;&s;i&s;tance of another woman almo&s;t as poor as her&s;elf; who, though &s;he had no light burthen of her own, cheerfully lent an helping hand to a fellow traveller who was &s;till more heavily laden. This friend had indeed little or nothing to give, but the very voice of kindne&s;s is &s;oothing to the weary. And I remarked in many other ca&s;es, that it was not &s;o much the degree of the help afforded, as the manner of helping that lightened the burthens. Some had a coar&s;e, rough, clum&s;y way of a&s;&s;i&s;ting a neighbor, which, though in fact it might be of real u&s;e, yet &s;eemed, by galling the travellers, to add to the load it was intended to lighten; while I ob&s;erved in others that &s;o cheap a kindne&s;s as a mild word, or even an affectionate look, made a poor burthened wretch move on cheerily. The bare feeling that &s;ome human being cared for him, &s;eemed to light|en the load. But to return to this kind neighbor. She had a little old book in her hand, the covers of which were worn out by much u&s;e. When &s;he &s;aw the blind woman ready to faint, &s;he would read her a few words out of this book, &s;uch as the following&mdash;<HI>ble&s;&s;ed are the poor in &s;pirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.&mdash;Ble&s;&s;ed are they that mourn, for they &s;hall be comforted.

<HEAD>THE NEGROES.</HEAD>
<P>I now &s;pied a &s;warm of poor black men, women, and children, a multitude which no man could number; the&s;e groaned and toiled, and &s;weated, and bled under far heavier loads than I had yet &s;een. But for a while no man helped them; at length a few white travellers were touched with the &s;orrowful &s;ighing of tho&s;e mil|lions, and very heartily did they pat their hands to the burthens; but their number was not quite equal to the work they had undertaken. I perceived, however, that they never lo&s;t &s;ight of tho&s;e poor heavy-laden wretches, and as the number of the&s;e generous helpers encrea&s;ed, I felt a comfortable hope, that before all the blacks got out of the Valley, the whites would fairly divide the burthen, and the loads would be effectually lightened.</P>
<P>Among the travellers, I had occa&s;ion to remark, that tho&s;e who mo&s;t kicked and &s;truggled under their bur|thens, only made them &s;o much the heavier; for their
<PB N="148" REF="035296_0242_1001C208D2724A40">&s;houlders became extremely galled by tho&s;e vain &s;trug|gles. The load, if borne patiently, would in the end have turned even to the advantage of the bearers, (for &s;o the Lord of the Valley had kindly decreed) but as to the&s;e grumblers, they had all the &s;mart and none of the benefit. But the thing which made all the&s;e burthens &s;eem &s;o very heavy was, that in every one without ex|ception, there was a certain <HI>inner pacquet,</HI> which mo&s;t of the travellers took pains to conceal, and carefully wrap up; and while they were forward enough to complain of the other part of their burthens, few &s;aid a word about this; though in truth it was the pre&s;&s;ing weight of this <HI>&s;ecret pacquet</HI> which &s;erved to render the general burthen &s;o intolerable. In &s;pite of all their caution, I contrived to get a peep at it; I found in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ach that this pacquet had the &s;ame <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">bel: the word SIN was written on all as a general title, and in ink &s;o black that they could not wa&s;h it out. I ob&s;erved that mo&s;t of them took no &s;mall pains to hide the writing; but I was &s;urpri&s;ed to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e that they did not try to g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t rid of the load but the label.

<P>I &s;aw with plea&s;ure, however, that &s;ome who had long labored heartily to get rid of this inward pacqu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t at length found it much dimini&s;hed, and the more this pacquet &s;hrunk in &s;ize, the lighter was the other part of their burthens al&s;o.</P>
<P>Then, methought, all at once, I heard a voice as it had been the voice of an angel, crying out and &s;aying, "Ye unhappy Pilgrims, why are ye troubled about the burthen which ye are doomed to bear through this Val|ley of Tears? Know ye not that as &s;oon as ye &s;hall

<P>NOW I had a &s;econd vi&s;ion of what was pa&s;&s;ing in <HI>the Valley of Tears.</HI> Methought I &s;aw again the &s;ame kind of travellers whom I had &s;een in the former part, and they were wandering at large through the &s;ame va&s;t wilderne&s;s.

But as he did not cau&s;e to lavi&s;h his favors where there &s;eemed no di&s;po&s;ition to receive them, he would not be&s;tow any of his oil on &s;uch as did not think it worth a&s;king for. <HI>A&s;k and ye &s;hall have,</HI> was the rule he laid down for them. Many were prevented from a&s;king through pride, for they thought they had light enough already, preferring the feeble glimmerings of their own lamp to all the light from the king's trea&s;ury. Yet it was ob&s;erved of tho&s;e who rejected it, as think|ing they had enough, that hardly any acted up to what even their own light &s;hewed them. Others were deter|red from a&s;king, becau&s;e they were told that it not only pointed out the dangers and difficulties of the road, but by a certain reflecting power, it turned inward on them&s;elves, and revealed to them ugly &s;ights in their own hearts, to which they rather cho&s;e to be blind; for tho&s;e travellers <HI>cho&s;e darkne&s;s rather than light, becau&s;e their deeds were evil.</HI> Now it was remarkable that the&s;e two properties were in&s;eparable, and that the lamp would be of little outward u&s;e, except to tho&s;e who u&s;ed it as an internal reflector. A threat and a promi&s;e al&s;o never failed to accompany the offer of this light from the king, a promi&s;e that to tho&s;e who improved what they had, <HI>more &s;hould be given, and a threat that from tho&s;e who did not u&s;e it wi&s;ely, &s;hould be taken away even what they had.</HI></P>
<P>I ob&s;erved that when the road was very dangerous, when terrors and difficulties and death be&s;et the faithful traveller, then on their fervent importunity, the king voluntarily gave large and bountiful &s;upplies of light, &s;uch as in common &s;ea&s;ons never could have been ex|pected;

<P>Though many cho&s;e to depend entirely on their own lamp, yet it was ob&s;erved that this light was apt to go out if left to it&s;elf. It was ea&s;ily blown out by tho&s;e violent gu&s;ts which were perpetually howling through the wilderne&s;s, and indeed it was the natural tendency of that unwhole&s;ome atmo&s;phere to extingui&s;h it, ju&s;t as you have &s;een a candle go out when expo&s;ed to the vapours and foul air of a damp room. It was a melan|cholly &s;ight to &s;ee multitudes of travellers heedle&s;sly pacing on, boa&s;ting that they had light enough, and de&s;pi&s;ing the offer of more. But what a&s;toni&s;hed me mo&s;t of all was, to &s;ee many, and &s;ome of them too ac|counted men of fir&s;t rate wit, actually bu&s;y in blowing out their own light, becau&s;e while any &s;park of it re|mained, it only &s;erved to torment them, and point out things which they did not wi&s;h to &s;ee. And having once blown out their own light, they were not ea&s;y till they had blown out that of their neighbor's al&s;o; &s;o that a good part of the wilderne&s;s &s;eemed to exhibit a &s;ort of univer&s;al <HI>blindman's buff,</HI> each endeavoring to catch his neighbor, while his own voluntary blindne&s;s expo&s;ed him to be caught him&s;elf, &s;o that each was ac|tually falling into the &s;nare he was laying for another, till at length, as &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s is the natural con&s;equence of blindne&s;s, "catch he that catch can," became the gen|eral cry throughout the wilderne&s;s.</P>
<P>Now I &s;aw in my vi&s;ion that there were &s;ome others who were bu&s;y in &s;trewing the mo&s;t gaudy flowers over the numerous bogs, precipices, and pit-falls with which the wilderne&s;s abounded, and thus making danger and death look &s;o gay, that poor thoughtle&s;s creatures &s;eem|ed to delight in their own de&s;truction. Tho&s;e pit-falls did not appear deep or dangerous, becau&s;e over them were rai&s;ed gay edifices with alluring names, in which
<PB N="252" REF="035296_0246_1001C21DF7F370C8">were &s;inging men and &s;inging women, and dancing, and fea&s;ting, and gaming, and drinking, and jollity, and madne&s;s. But though the &s;cenery was gay, the footing was un&s;ound. The floors were full of holes through which the unthinking merry-makers were con|tinually &s;inking. Some tumbled through in the middle of a &s;ong, many at the end of a fea&s;t, and though there was many a cup of intoxication wreathed with flowers, yet there was always poi&s;on at the bottom. But what mo&s;t &s;urpri&s;ed me was, that though no day pa&s;&s;ed over their heads in which &s;ome of tho&s;e merry-makers did not drop through, yet their lo&s;s made little impre&s;&s;ion on tho&s;e who were left. Nay, in&s;tead of being awa|kened to more circum&s;pection and &s;elf-denial by the continual dropping off of tho&s;e about them, &s;everal of them &s;eemed to borrow from thence an argument of a direct contrary tendency, and the very &s;hortne&s;s of the time was only urged as a rea&s;on to u&s;e it more &s;edulous|ly for the indulgence in &s;en&s;ual delights. <HI>Let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die. Let us crown our|&s;elves with ro&s;e-buds before they are withered.</HI> With the&s;e and a thou&s;and other &s;uch little mottos, the gay garlands of the wilderne&s;s were decorated. Some ad|mired poets were &s;et to work to put the mo&s;t corrupt &s;entiments into the mo&s;t harmonious tunes; the&s;e were &s;ung without &s;cruple, chiefly indeed by the loo&s;er &s;ons of riot, but not &s;eldom al&s;o by the more orderly daugh|ters of &s;obriety, who were not a&s;hamed to &s;ing to the &s;ound of in&s;truments, &s;entiments &s;o corrupt and immo|ral, that they would have blu&s;hed to &s;peak or read them; but the mu&s;ic &s;eemed to &s;anctify the corruption, e&s;pe|cially &s;uch as was connected with love or drinking.</P>
<P>Now I ob&s;erved that all the travellers who had &s;o much as a &s;park of light left, &s;eemed every now and then, as they moved onwards, to ca&s;t an eye, though with very different degrees of attention, towards the <HI>happy land,</HI> which they were told lay at the end of their
<PB N="153" REF="035296_0247_1001C22542281FC0">journey; but as they could not &s;ee very far forward, and as they knew there was a <HI>dark and &s;hadowy valley</HI> which mu&s;t needs be cro&s;&s;ed before they could attain to the <HI>happy land,</HI> they tried to turn their attention from it as much as they could. The truth is, they were not &s;ufficiently apt to con&s;ult a map which the king had given them, and which pointed cut the road to the hap|py land &s;o clearly, that <HI>the way-faring men, though &s;imple, could not err.</HI> This map al&s;o defined very cor|rectly the boundaries of the <HI>happy land</HI> from the <HI>land of mi&s;ery,</HI> both of which lay on the other &s;ide of the <HI>dark and &s;hadowy valley;</HI> but &s;o many beacons and light-hou&s;es were erected, &s;o many clear and explicit directions furni&s;hed for avoiding the one country and attaining the other, that it was not the king's fault, if even one &s;ingle traveller got wrong. But I am incli|ned to think that in &s;pite of the map, and the king's word, and his offers of a&s;&s;i&s;tance to get them thither, that the travellers in general did not heartily and truly believe after all, that there was any &s;uch country as the <HI>happy land;</HI> or at lea&s;t, the paltry and tran&s;ient plea|&s;ures of the wilderne&s;s &s;o be&s;otted them, the thoughts of the <HI>dark and &s;hadowy valley</HI> &s;o frightened them, that they thought they &s;hould be more comfortable by ban|i&s;hing all thought and foreca&s;t.</P>
<P>Now I al&s;o &s;aw in my dream, that there were two roads through the wilderne&s;s, one of which every tra|veller mu&s;t needs take. The fir&s;t was narrow and dif|ficult, and rough, but it was infallibly &s;afe. It did not admit the traveller to &s;tray either to the right hand or the left, yet it was far from being de&s;titute of real com|forts or &s;ober plea&s;ures. The other was a <HI>broad and tempting way,</HI> abounding with luxurious fruits and gaudy flowers to tempt the eye, and plea&s;e the appe|tite. To forget this dark valley, through which every traveller was well a&s;&s;ured he mu&s;t one day pa&s;s, &s;eem|ed indeed the object of general de&s;ire. To this grand
<PB N="154" REF="035296_0248_1001C22A88883440">end, all that human ingenuity could invent was indus|triou&s;ly &s;et to work. The travellers read, and they wrote, and they painted, and they &s;ung, and they dan|ced, and they drank as they went along, not &s;o much becau&s;e they all cared for the&s;e things, or had any real joy in th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">, as becau&s;e this re&s;tle&s;s activity &s;erved to divert their attention from ever being fixed on the <HI>dark and &s;hadowy valley.</HI></P>
<P>The king, who knew the thoughtle&s;s temper of the travellers, and how apt they were to forget their jour|ney's end, had thought of a thou&s;and little kind atten|tions to warn them of their dangers. And as we &s;ome|times &s;ee in our gardens written on a board in great let|ters, BEWARE OF SPRING GUNS&mdash;MAN TRAPS ARE SET HERE; &s;o had this king cau&s;ed to be written and &s;tuck up before the eyes of the travellers, &s;everal like notices and cautions, &s;uch as <HI>broad is the way that leadeth to de&s;truction&mdash;Take heed le&s;t ye al&s;o peri&s;h&mdash;Woe to them that ri&s;e up early to drink wine&mdash;The plea|&s;ures of &s;in are but for a &s;ea&s;on,</HI> &amp;c. Such were the notices directed to the <HI>broad-way</HI> travellers, but they were &s;o bu&s;ily engaged in plucking the flowers, &s;ome|times before they were blown, and in devouring the fruits, often before they were ripe, and in loading them&s;elves with <HI>yellow-clay,</HI> under the weight of which millions peri&s;hed, that they had no time &s;o much as to look at the king's directions. Many went wrong be|cau&s;e they preferred a merry journey to a &s;afe one, and were terrified by certain notices, chiefly intended for the <HI>narrow-way</HI> travellers, &s;uch as, <HI>ye &s;hall weep and lament, but the world &s;hall rejoice;</HI> but had the&s;e fool|i&s;h people allowed them&s;elves time or patience to read to the end, which they &s;eldom would do, they would have &s;een the&s;e comfortable words added, <HI>but your &s;or|row &s;hall be turned into joy,</HI> al&s;o, <HI>your joy no man ta|keth from you, and they that &s;ow in tears &s;hall reap in joy.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="155" REF="035296_0249_1001C23041C7A870">
Now I al&s;o &s;aw in my dream, that many travellers who had a &s;trong dread of ending at the <HI>land of mi&s;ery,</HI> walked up to the <HI>Strait Gate,</HI> hoping that though the entrance was narrow, yet if they could once get in, the road would widen; but what was their grief when on looking more clo&s;ely, they &s;aw written on the in&s;ide, <HI>narrow is the way;</HI> this made them take fright, they compared the in&s;criptions with which the whole way was lined, &s;uch as, <HI>be ye not conformed to this world&mdash; deny your&s;elves&mdash;take up your cro&s;s,</HI> with all the tempt|ing plea&s;ures of the wilderne&s;s. Some indeed recollect|ed the &s;ine de&s;criptions they had read of the <HI>happy land, the golden city, and the rivers of plea&s;ures,</HI> and they &s;ighed: but then, tho&s;e joys were di&s;tant, and from the faintne&s;s of their light, they &s;oon got to think that what was remote might be uncertain, and while the pre&s;ent good increa&s;ed in bulk by its nearne&s;s, the di&s;tant good receded, dimini&s;hed, di&s;appeared! Their faith failed, they would tru&s;t no farther than they could &s;ee; they drew back and got into the <HI>broad-way,</HI> taking a com|mon but &s;ad refuge in the number and gaiety of their companions. When the&s;e &s;aint-hearted people, who yet had &s;et out well, turned back, their light was quite put out, and then they became wor&s;e than tho&s;e who had made no attempt to get in. <HI>For it is impo&s;&s;ible,</HI> that is, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> is next to impo&s;&s;ible, <HI>for tho&s;e who were once enlightened, and have ta&s;ted of the heavenly gift, and the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come, if they fall away, to renew them again to repen|tance.</HI></P>
<P>A few hone&s;t humble travellers not naturally &s;tron|ger than the re&s;t, but &s;trengthened by their tru&s;t in the king's word, came up by the light of their lamps, and meekly entered in at the <HI>Strait Gate;</HI> as they advan|ced farther they f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> lo&s;s heavy, and though the way did not in reality grow wider, yet they grew reconci|led to the narrowne&s;s of it, e&s;pecially when they &s;aw
<PB N="156" REF="035296_0250_1001C23441E22D80">the walls here and there &s;tudded with certain jewels cal|led <HI>promi&s;es,</HI> &s;uch as <HI>he that endureth to the end &s;hall be &s;aved.</HI> And <HI>my grace is &s;ufficient for you.</HI> Some when they were almo&s;t ready to faint, were encouraged by &s;eeing that many niches in the <HI>narrow-way</HI> were filled with &s;tatues and pictures of Saints and Martyrs, who had borne their te&s;timony at the &s;take, that the <HI>narrow-way</HI> was the &s;afe way; and the&s;e travellers, in&s;tead of &s;inking at the &s;ight of the painted wheel and gibbet, the &s;word and the furnace, were animated by the&s;e words written under them, <HI>tho&s;e that wear white robes came out of great tribulation,</HI> and <HI>be ye followers of tho&s;e, who, through faith and patience, inherit the promi&s;es.</HI></P>
<P>In the mean time there came a great multitude of travellers, all from <HI>Laodicea;</HI> this was the large&s;t party I had yet &s;een; the&s;e were <HI>neither hot nor cold,</HI> they would not give up future hope, they could not endure pre&s;ent pain; &s;o they contrived to deceive them&s;elves by fancying that they re&s;olved to keep the <HI>happy land</HI> in view, yet that there needs mu&s;t be many different ways which led to it, no doubt all equally &s;ure, with|out being all equally rough; &s;o they &s;et on foot little contrivances to attain the end without u&s;ing the means, and &s;oftened down the &s;pirit of the king's directions to fit them to their own practice. Sometimes they would &s;plit a direction in two, and only u&s;e that half which &s;uited them. For in&s;tance, when they met with the following rule, <HI>Tru&s;t in the Lord and be doing good,</HI> they would take the fir&s;t half, and make them&s;elves ea&s;y with a general &s;ort of tru&s;t, that through the mercy of the king all would go will with them, though they them&s;elves did nothing; and on the other hand, many made &s;ure that a few good works of their own would do their bu&s;ine&s;s, and carry them &s;afely to the <HI>happy land,</HI> though they did not tru&s;t in the Lord, nor place any faith in his word. Thus, &s;ome peri&s;hed by a lazy
<PB N="157" REF="035296_0251_1001C23C96D48F08">faith, and others by a working pride. A large party of <HI>Phari&s;ees</HI> now appeared, who had &s;o neglected their lamp that they did not &s;ee their way at all, though they fancied them&s;elves to be full of light; they kept up ap|pearances &s;o well, as to delude others, and mo&s;t effectu|ally to delude them&s;elves with a notion that they might be found in the right way at la&s;t. In this dreadful delu|&s;ion they went on to the end, and till they were finally plunged in the dark valley, never di&s;covered the horrors which awaited them on the di&s;mal &s;hore. It was rema|kable that while the&s;e Phari&s;ees were often boa&s;ting how bright their light burnt, in order to get the prai&s;e of men, the humble travellers, who&s;e &s;teady light &s;hew|ed their good works to others, refu&s;ed all commendation, and the brighter their light &s;hined before men, &s;o much the more they in&s;i&s;ted that they ought to glorify not them&s;elves, but <HI>their Father which is in Heaven.</HI></P>
<P>I now &s;et my&s;elf to ob&s;erve what was the particular let, mole&s;tation, and hindrance, which ob&s;tructed parti|cular travellers in their endeavors to enter in at the Strait Gate. I remarked a huge portly man who &s;eem|ed de&s;irous of getting in, but he carried about him &s;uch a va&s;t provi&s;ion of bags full of gold, and had on &s;o ma|ny rich garments which &s;tuffed him out &s;o wide, that though he pu&s;hed and &s;queezed, like one who had really a mind to get in, yet he could not po&s;&s;ibly do &s;o. Then I heard a voice crying, <HI>woe to him that loadeth him&s;elf with thick clay.</HI> The poor man felt &s;omething was wrong, and even went &s;o far as to change &s;ome of his more cumber&s;ome vanities into others which &s;eemed lo&s;s bulky, but &s;till he and his pack were much too wide for the gate. He would not however give up the matter &s;o ea&s;ily, but began to throw away a little of the coar&s;er part of his baggage, but &s;till I remarked that he threw away none of the vanities which lay near his heart. He tried again, but it would not do; &s;till his
<PB N="158" REF="035296_0252_1001C243E31E0D20">read the&s;e words, <HI>how hardly &s;hall tho&s;e who have riche<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> enter into the kingdom of God.</HI> The poor man &s;ighed to find it was impo&s;&s;ible to enjoy his fill of both worlds, <HI>and went away &s;orrowing.</HI> If he ever afterwards ca&s;t a thought towards the <HI>happy land,</HI> it was only to regret that the road which led to it was too narrow to admit any but the meagre children of want, who were not &s;o incumbered by wealth as to be too big for the pa&s;&s;age. Had he read on he would have &s;een that <HI>with God all things are po&s;&s;ible.</HI></P>
<P>Another advanced with much confidence of &s;ucce&s;s, for having little worldly riches or hono<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">, the gate did not &s;eem &s;o &s;trait to him. He got to the thre&s;hold tri|umphantly, and &s;eemed to look back with di&s;dain on all that he was quitting. He &s;oon found, however, that he was &s;o bloated with pride, and &s;tuffed out with &s;elf-&s;ufficiency, that he could not get in. Nay, he was in a wor&s;e way than the rich man ju&s;t named; for <HI>he</HI> was willing to throw away &s;ome of his outward luggage, whereas this man refu&s;ed to part with a grain of that vanity and &s;elf-applau&s;e which made him too big for the way. The &s;en&s;e of his own worth &s;o &s;welled him out, that he &s;tuck fa&s;t in the <HI>gateway,</HI> and could neither get in nor out. Finding now that he mu&s;t cut off all tho&s;e big thoughts of him&s;elf if he wi&s;hed to be reduced to &s;uch a &s;ize as to pa&s;s the gate, he gave up all thoughts of it. He &s;corned that humility and &s;elf-denial which might have &s;hrunk him down to the proper dimen&s;ions; the more he in&s;i&s;ted on his own qualifications for en|trance, the more impo&s;&s;ible it became, for the bigger he grew. Finding that he mu&s;t become quite another manner of man before he could hope to get in, he gave up the de&s;ire; and I now &s;aw that though when he &s;et his face towards the <HI>happy land</HI> he could not yet an inch forward, yet the in&s;tant he made a motion <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">turn back into the world, his &s;peed became rapid enough, and he &s;oon got back into the <HI>broaa-way.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="159" REF="035296_0253_1001C249E74E5508">
Many, who fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> a time were brought from their u&s;ual bulk by &s;ome affliction, &s;eemed to get in with ca&s;e.&mdash;They now thought all their difficulties over, for having been &s;urfeited with the world, during their late di&s;ap|pointment, they turned their backs upon it willingly e|nough. A fit of &s;ickne&s;s perhaps, which is very apt to reduce, had for a time brought their bodies into &s;ubjec|tion, &s;o that they were able ju&s;t to get in at the <HI>gateway;</HI> but as &s;oon as health and &s;pirits returned, the way grew narrower and narrower to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">em; they could not get on, but turned &s;hort, and got back into the world. I &s;aw many attempt to enter who were &s;topt &s;hort by a large burthen of worldly cares; others by a load of idolatrous attachments; but I ob&s;er<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed that nothing proved a more complete bar than that va&s;t bundle of prejudices with which multitudes were loaded. Others were fatally ob|&s;tructed by loads of bad habits which they would not lay down, though they knew it prevented their entrance. Some few, however, of mo&s;t de&s;criptions, who had kept their light alive, by craving con&s;tant &s;upplies from the king's trea&s;ury, got through at la&s;t by a &s;trength which they felt not to be their own. One poor man, who carried the large&s;t bundle of bad habits I had &s;een, could not get on a &s;tep; he never cea&s;ed, however, to implore for light enough to &s;ee where his mi&s;ery lay; he threw down one of his bundles, then another, but all to little purpo&s;e; &s;till he could not &s;tir. At la&s;t &s;triving as if in an agony, (which is the true way of entering) he threw down the heavie&s;t article in his pack; this was <HI>&s;elfi&s;hne&s;s;</HI> the poor fellow felt relieved at once, his light burnt brightly, and the re&s;t of his paok was as nothing.</P>
<P>Then I heard a great noi&s;e as of carpenters at work. I looked what this might be, and &s;aw many &s;turdy tra|vellers, who finding they were too bulky to get through, took it into their heads not to reduce them&s;elves, but to widen the gate; they hacked on this &s;ide, and hewed on that; but all their hacking, and hewing, and hammering,
<PB N="160" REF="035296_0254_1001C24ECE35BDB8">was to no purpo&s;e, they got only their labor for their pains; it was po&s;&s;ible they might have reduced them|&s;elves, but they could not widen the way.</P>
<P>What grieved me mo&s;t was to ob&s;erve that many who had got on &s;ucce&s;sfully a good way, now &s;topped to re&s;t, and to admire their own progre&s;s. While they were thus valuing them&s;elves on their attainments, their light dimini&s;hed.

<HEAD>THE COTTAGE COOK; OR, MRS. JONES's <HI>CHEAP DISHES;</HI></HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Shewing the Way to do much Good with a little Money.</HEAD>
<P>MRS. JONES was a great merchant's lady. She was liberal to the poor, but as &s;he was too much taken up with the world, &s;he did not &s;pare &s;o much of her time and thoughts about doing good as &s;he ought, &s;o that her money was often ill be&s;towed. In the late troubles, Mr. Jones, who had lived in a grand manner, failed, and he took his misfortunes &s;o much to heart that he fell &s;ick and died. Mrs. Jones retired on a very nar|row income to t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> &s;mall village of We&s;ton, where &s;he &s;eldom went out except to church. Though a pious woman &s;he was too apt to indulge her &s;orrow; and tho' &s;he did not neglect to read and pray, yet &s;he gave up a great part of her time to melancholy thoughts, and grew quite inactive. She well knew how &s;inful it would be for her to &s;eek a cure for her grief in worldly plea|&s;ures, which is a way many people take under afflictions, but &s;he was not aware how wrong it was to weep away that time which might have been better &s;pent in drying the tears of others.</P>
<P>It was happy for her that Mr. Simp&s;on, the vicar of We&s;ton, was a pious man. One Sunday he happened to preach upon the good Samaritan. It was a charity &s;ermon, and there was a collection at the door. He called on Mrs. Jones after church, and found her in tears. She told him &s;he had been much moved by his di&s;cour&s;e, and &s;he wept becau&s;e &s;he had &s;o little to give
<PB N="162" REF="035296_0256_1001A3B607C72A48">to the plate; for though &s;he felt very keenly for the poor in the&s;e dear times, yet &s;he could not a&s;&s;i&s;t them. "Indeed fir," added &s;he, "I never &s;o much regretted the lo&s;s of my fortune, as this afternoon, when you bade us <HI>go and do likewi&s;e."</HI> "You do not," replied Mr. Simp|&s;on, "enter into the &s;pirit of our Saviour's parable, if you think you cannot <HI>go and do likewi&s;e</HI> without being rich. In the ca&s;e of the Samaritan you may ob&s;erve, that charity was afforded more by kindne&s;s, and care, and medicine, than by money. You, Madam, were as much concerned in my &s;ermon, as Sir John with his great e&s;tate; and, to &s;peak plainly, I have been &s;ome|times &s;urpi&s;ed that you &s;hould not put your&s;elf in the way of being more u&s;eful."</P>
<P>"Sir," &s;aid Mrs. Jones, "I am grown &s;hy of the poor &s;ince I have nothing to give them." "Nothing Ma|dam," replied the clergyman, "do you call your time, your talents, your kind offices nothing? I will venture to &s;ay that you might do more good than the riche&s;t man in the pari&s;h could do by merely giving his money. In|&s;tead of &s;itting here, brooding over your misfortunes, which are pa&s;t remedy, be&s;tir your&s;elf to find out ways of doing much good with little money; or even without any money at all. You have lately &s;tudied oeconomy for your&s;elf. In&s;truct your poor neighbors in it. They want it almo&s;t as much as they want money. You have influence with the few rich per&s;ons in the pari&s;h. Exert that influence. Betty, my hou&s;ekeeper, &s;hall as|&s;i&s;t you in any thing in which &s;he can be u&s;eful. Try this for one year, and if you then tell me that you &s;hould have better &s;hewn your love to God and man, and been a happier woman had you continued gloomy and inac|tive, I &s;hall be much &s;urpri&s;ed."</P>
<P>The &s;ermon and this di&s;cour&s;e made &s;o deep an im|pre&s;&s;ion on Mrs. Jones, that &s;he formed a new plan of life, and &s;et about it at once, as every body does who is in earne&s;t. Her chief arm was the happine&s;s of her poor
<PB N="163" REF="035296_0257_1001C25E68FFBA40">neighbors in the next world; but &s;he was al&s;o very de|&s;irous to promote their pre&s;ent comfort. The plans &s;he pur&s;ued with a view to the latter object &s;hall be explain|ed in this little book. Mrs. Jones was much re&s;pect<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d by all the rich per&s;ons in We&s;ton who had known her in her pro&s;perity. Sir John was thoughtle&s;s, lavi&s;h, and indolent. The 'Squire was over-frugal, but active, &s;ober, and not ill-natured. Sir John loved plea&s;ure, the 'Squire loved money. Sir John was one of tho&s;e popular &s;ort of people who get much prai&s;e and yet do little good; who &s;ub&s;cribe with equal readine&s;s to a cricket match or a charity &s;chool; who take it for granted that the poor are to be indulged with bell-ringing and bonfires, and to be made drunk at Chri&s;tmas; this Sir John called be|ing kind to them; but he thought it was folly to teach them, and madne&s;s to think of reforming them.&mdash;He was, however, always ready to give his guinea; but I que&s;tion whether he would have given up his hunting and his gaining to have cured every grievance in the land. On the other hand, the 'Squire would a&s;&s;i&s;t Mrs. Jones in any of her plans if it co&s;t him nothing; &s;o &s;he &s;hew|ed her good &s;en&s;e by never a&s;king Sir John for advice, or the 'Squire for &s;ub&s;criptions, and by this prudence gained the full &s;upport of both.</P>
<P>Mrs. Jones re&s;olved to &s;pend two or three days in a week in getting acquainted with the &s;tate of the pari&s;h, and &s;he took care never to walk out without a few little good books in her pocket to give away. She found that among the numerous wants &s;he met with, no &s;mall &s;hare was owing to bad management or to indi&s;po&s;ition. She was &s;truck with the &s;mall &s;ize of the loaves. Wheat was now not very dear, and &s;he was &s;ure a good deal of blame re&s;ted with the baker. She &s;ent for a &s;hilling loaf to the next great town where the mayor often &s;ent to the bakers' &s;tops to &s;ee that the bread was prop<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r weight. She weighed her town loaf again&s;t her coun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ry loaf, and found the latter two pounds lighter than it
<PB N="164" REF="035296_0258_1001C26325FAEE50">ought to be. This was not the &s;ort of grievance to carry to Sir John; but luckily the 'Squire was al&s;o a magi&s;trate, and it was quite in his way. He told her he could remedy the evil if &s;ome one would lodge the in|formation again&s;t the baker.</P>
<P>She dropt in on the black&s;mith. He was at dinner. She enquired if his bread was good. "Aye, good enough mi&s;tre&s;s, for you &s;ee 'tis as white as your cap, if we had but more of it. Here's a &s;ixpenny loaf, you might take it for a penny roll!" He then heartily cur&s;ed Crib the the baker and &s;aid he ought to be hanged. Mrs. Jones now told him what &s;he had done, how &s;he had detected the fraud, and a&s;&s;ured him the evil &s;hould be redre&s;&s;ed on the morrow, provided he would appear and inform. "I inform!" &s;aid he with a &s;hocking oath, "hang an informer! I &s;corn the office." "You are nice in the wrong place, friend," replied Mrs. Jones, "for you do not &s;corn to abu&s;e the baker, nor to be in a pa&s;&s;ion, nor to &s;wear, though you &s;corn to redre&s;s a public injury, and to increa&s;e your children's bread. Let me tell you, there is nothing in which you ignorant people mi&s;take more than in your notions about <HI>informers.</HI> Informing is the lawful way of obtaining redre&s;s, and though it is a mi&s;chievous and a hateful thing to go to a ju&s;tice about every trifling matter, yet laying an information on im|portant occa&s;ions, without malice or bitterne&s;s of any kind, is what no hone&s;t man ought to be a&s;hamed of.&mdash;The &s;hame is to commit the offence, not to inform a|gain&s;t it. I, for my part, &s;hould p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rhaps do right if I not only informed again&s;t Crib for making light bread, but again&s;t you for &s;wearing at him." "Well but ma|dam," &s;aid the &s;mith, a little &s;oftened, "don't you think it a &s;in and a &s;hame to turn informer?" "So far from it when a man's motives are good," &s;aid Mrs. Jones, "that in &s;uch clear ca&s;es as the pre&s;ent, I think it a du|ty and a virtue. If it is right that there &s;hould be laws, it mu&s;t be right that they &s;hould be put in exe|cution;
<PB N="165" REF="035296_0259_1001C26863916090">but how can this be, if people will not inform the magi&s;trates when they &s;ee the laws broken? An informer by trade is commonly a knave; a ra&s;h, mali|cious, or pa&s;tionate informer is a fire-brand, but hone&s;t and prudent informers are almo&s;t as u&s;eful members of &s;ociety as the judges of the land. If you continue in your pre&s;ent mind on this &s;ubject, do not you think that you will be an&s;werable for the crimes you might have prevented by informing, and be a &s;ort of accom|plice of the villains who commit them?"</P>
<P>"Well madam," &s;aid the &s;mith, "I now &s;ee plainly enough, that there is no &s;hame in turning informer when my cau&s;e is good." "And your motive right, always mind that," &s;aid Mrs. Jones. Next day the &s;mith attended, Crib was fined in the u&s;ual penalty, his light bread was taken from him, and given to the poor. The ju&s;tices re&s;olved henceforward to in&s;pect the ba|kers in their di&s;trict; and all of them, except Crib, and &s;uch as Crib, were glad of it, for hone&s;ty never dreads a trial. Thus had Mrs. Jones the comfort of &s;eeing how u&s;eful people may be without expence; for if &s;he could have given the poor 50 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> &s;he would not have done them &s;o great or &s;o la&s;ting a benefit, and the true light in which &s;he had put the bu&s;ine&s;s of <HI>informing,</HI> was of no &s;mall u&s;e.</P>
<P>There were two &s;hops in the pari&s;h, but Mrs. Sparks at the Cro&s;s had not half &s;o much cu&s;tom as Wills at the Sugar Loaf, though &s;he &s;old her goods a penny in a &s;hilling cheaper, and all agreed that they were much better. Mrs. Jones a&s;ked Mrs. Sparks the rea&s;on.&mdash;"Madam," &s;aid the &s;hop-keeper, "Mr. Wills will give longer tru&s;t. Be&s;ides this, his wife keeps &s;hop on a Sunday morning while I am at Church." Mrs. Jones reminded Mr. Simp&s;on to read the King's proclamation again&s;t vice and immorality next Sunday at Church, and prevailed on the 'Squire to fine any one who &s;hould keep open &s;hop on a Sunday. She al&s;o put the people
<PB N="166" REF="035296_0260_1001C26C736FE090">in mind that a &s;hop-keeper, who would &s;ell on a Sun|day, would be more likely to cheat them all the week, than one who went to Church.</P>
<P>She al&s;o labored hard to convince them how much they would le&s;&s;en their di&s;tre&s;s if they would contrive to deal with Mrs. Sparks for ready money, rather than with Wills on long credit; tho&s;e who li&s;tened to her, found their circum&s;tances far more comfortable at the year's end, while the re&s;t, tempted, like &s;ome of their betters, by the plea&s;ure of putting off the evil day of payment, like them at la&s;t found them&s;elves plunged in debt and di&s;tre&s;s. She took care to make a good u&s;e of &s;uch in&s;tances in her conver&s;ations with the poor, and by per&s;everance, &s;he at length brought them &s;o much to her way of thinking, that Wills found it to be his intere&s;t to alter his plan, and &s;ell his goods on as good terms and as &s;hort credit as Mrs. Sparks &s;old hers.&mdash;This compleated Mrs. Jones's &s;ucce&s;s, and &s;he had the &s;atisfaction of having put a &s;top to three or four great evils in the pari&s;h of We&s;ton, without &s;pending a &s;hil|ling in doing it.</P>
<P>Be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ty Smart and Jenny Ro&s;e were thought to be the two be&s;t managers in the pari&s;h. They both told Mrs. Jones that the poor would get the coar&s;e pieces of meat cheaper, if the gentlefolks did not buy them for &s;oups and gravy. Mrs. Jones thought there was rea&s;on in this. So away &s;he went to Sir John, the 'Squire, the Surgeon, the Attorney, and the Steward, the only per|&s;ons in the pari&s;h who could afford to buy co&s;tly things. She told them if they would all be &s;o good as to buy only prime pieces, which they could very well afford, the coar&s;e and cheap joints would come more within the reach of the poor. Mo&s;t of the gentry readily con&s;ent|ed. Sir John cared not what his meat co&s;t him, but told Mrs. Jones in his gay way, that he would eat any|thing, or give any thing, &s;o that &s;he would not teize him with long &s;tories about the poor. The 'Squire
<PB N="167" REF="035296_0261_1001C2708D354190">&s;aid he &s;hould prefer vegetable &s;oups becau&s;e they were cheaper, and the Doctor becau&s;e they were whole&s;omer. The Steward cho&s;e to imitate the 'Squire; and the At|torney found it would be quite ungenteel to &s;tand out. So gravy &s;oups became very unfa&s;hionable in the pari&s;h of We&s;ton; and I am &s;ure if rich people did but think a little on this &s;ubject, they would be as unfa&s;hionable in many other places.</P>
<P>When wheat grew cheaper, Mrs. Jones was earne&s;t with the poor women to bake large brown loaves at home, in&s;tead of buying &s;mall white ones at the &s;hop. Mrs. Betty had told her that baking at home would be one &s;tep towards re&s;toring the good old management. Only Betty Smart and Jenny Ro&s;e baked at home in the whole pari&s;h, and who lived &s;o well as they did? Yet the general objection &s;eemed rea&s;onable. They could not bake without yea&s;t, which often could not be had, as no one brewed but the great folks and the public hou&s;es. Mrs. Jones found, however, that Be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ty and Jenny contrived to brew as well as to bake. She &s;ent for the&s;e women, knowing that from them &s;he could get truth and rea&s;on. "How comes it," &s;aid &s;he to them, "that you two are the only poor women in the pari&s;h who can afford to brew a &s;mall ca&s;k of beer? Your hus|bands have not better wages than other men." "True Madam," &s;aid Betty, "but they never &s;et foot in a pub|lic hou&s;e. I will tell you the truth. When I fir&s;t mar|ried, our John went to the Checquers every night, and I had my tea and fre&s;h butter twice a day at home.&mdash;This &s;lop, which con&s;umed a deal of &s;ugar, began to <HI>rake</HI> my &s;tomach &s;adly, as I had neither meat nor milk; at la&s;t (I am a&s;hamed to own it) I began to take a drop of gin to quiet the pain, till in time I looked for my gin as regularly as for my tea. At la&s;t the gin, the ale|hou&s;e, and the tea, began to make us both &s;ick and poor. I had like to have died with my fir&s;t child.&mdash;Par&s;on Simp&s;on then talked &s;o finely to us that we re|&s;olved,
<PB N="163" REF="035296_0262_1001C2746C75A720">by the grace of God, to turn over a new leaf, and I promi&s;ed John if he would give up the Checquers I would break the gin-bottle, and never drink tea in the afternoon, except on Sundays when he was at home with me. We have kept our word, and both our eat|ing and drinking, our health and our con&s;ciences are the better for it. Though meat is &s;adly dear, we can buy two pounds of fre&s;h meat for le&s;s than one pound of fre&s;h butter, and it gives five times the nouri&s;hment.&mdash;And dear as malt is, I contrive to keep a drop of drink in the hou&s;e for John, and John will make me drink half a pint with him every evening, and a pint a day when I am a nur&s;e."</P>
<P>As one good deed as well as one bad one brings on another, this conver&s;ation &s;et Mrs. Jones on enquiring why &s;o many ale-hou&s;es were allowed. She did not chu&s;e to talk to Sir John on this &s;ubject, who would only have &s;aid, "let them enjoy them&s;elves poor fel|lows; if they get drunk now and then they work hard." But tho&s;e who have this fal&s;e good-nature, forget, that while the man is <HI>enjoying him&s;elf,</HI> as it is called, his wife and children are ragged and &s;tarving. True chris|tian good-nature never indulges one at the co&s;t of ma|ny, but is kind to all. The 'Squire, who was a friend to order, took up the matter. He con&s;ulted Mr. Simp|&s;on. "The Lion," &s;aid he, "is nece&s;&s;ary. It &s;tands by the road &s;ide: travellers mu&s;t have a re&s;ting place. As to the Checquers and the Bell they do no good but much harm." Mr. Simp&s;on had before made many at|tempts to get the Checquers put down; but unluckily, it was Sir John's own hou&s;e, and kept by his late butler. Not that Sir John valued the rent, but he had a fal&s;e kindne&s;s which made him &s;upport the cau&s;e of an old &s;ervant, though he knew he kept a di&s;orderly hou&s;e.&mdash;The 'Squire, however, now took away the licence from the Bell. And a fray happening &s;oon after at the Checquers (which was near the Church) in time of di|vine
<PB N="169" REF="035296_0263_1001C277C87AEDD0">&s;ervice, Sir John was obliged to &s;uffer the hou&s;e to be put down as a nui&s;ance. You would not believe how many poor families were able to brew a little ca&s;k when the temptations of tho&s;e ale-hou&s;es were taken out of their way. Mrs. Jones, in her evening walks, had the plea&s;ure to &s;ee many an hone&s;t man drinking his whole&s;ome cup of beer by his own fire &s;ide, his ro&s;y children playing about his knees, his clean, cheerful wife &s;inging h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r younge&s;t baby to &s;leep, rocking the cradle with her foot, while with her hands &s;he was ma|king a dumpling for her kind hu&s;band's &s;upper. Some few, I am &s;orry to &s;ay, though I don't chu&s;e to name names, &s;till preferred getting drunk once a week at the Lion, and drinking water at other times.</P>
<P>The good women being now &s;upplied with yea&s;t from each other's brewings, would have baked, but two difficulties &s;till remained. Many of them had no ovens, for &s;ince the new bad management had crept in, many cottages have been built without this convenience. Fuel was al&s;o &s;carce at We&s;ton. Mrs. Jones advi&s;ed the building a large pari&s;h oven. To this oven, at a certain h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">, three times a week, the elder children carried the loaves which their mothers had made at home, and paid a half-penny, or a penny, according to their &s;ize, for the baking.</P>
<P>Mrs. Jones found that no poor woman in We&s;ton could buy a little milk, as the farmers' wives did not care to rob their dairies.&mdash;This was a great di&s;tre&s;s, e&s;pecially when the children were &s;ick. So Mrs. Jones advi&s;ed Mrs. Sparks at the Cro&s;s, to keep a couple of cows, and &s;ell out the milk at half-penny worths. She did &s;o, and found, that though this plan gave her &s;ome additional trouble, &s;he got full as much by it as if &s;he had made chee&s;e and butter. She al&s;o &s;old rice at a cheap rate, &s;o that with the help of the milk and the public oven, a fine rice pudding was to be had for a trifle.</P>
<P><PB N="170" REF="035296_0264_1001C27B8AF80778">
The girls' &s;chool in the pari&s;h was fallen into ne|glect, for though many would be &s;ub&s;cribers, yet no one would look after it. I wi&s;h this was the ca&s;e at We&s;ton only. It was not in Mr. Simp&s;on's way to &s;ee if girls were taught to work. This is ladies' bu&s;i|ne&s;s. Mrs. Jones con&s;ulted her coun&s;ellor, Mrs. Bet|ty, and they went every Friday to the &s;chool, where they invited mothers as well as daughters to come, and learn to cut out to the be&s;t advantage. Mrs. Jones had not been bred to the&s;e things, but by means of Mrs. Cooper's excellent cutting out book, &s;he &s;oon became mi&s;tre&s;s of the whole art. She not only had the girls taught to make and mend, but to wa&s;h andiron too. She al&s;o allowed the mother or elde&s;t daughter of every family to come once a week and learn how to dre&s;s <HI>one cheap di&s;h.</HI> One Friday, which was cooking day, who &s;hould pa&s;s by but the 'Squire, with his gun and his dogs.&mdash; He looked into the &s;chool for the fir&s;t time. "Well, madam," &s;aid he, "what good are you doing here?&mdash; What are you girls learning and earning? Where are your manufactures? Where is your &s;pinning and your carding?" "Sir," &s;aid &s;he, "this is a &s;mall pari&s;h, and you know ours is not a manufacturing country; &s;o that when the&s;e girls are women, they will not be much employed in &s;pinning. However, we teach them a lit|tle of it, and more of knitting, that they may be able to get up a &s;mall piece of hou&s;ehold linen once a year, and provide the family with &s;tockings, by employing the odds and ends of their time in the&s;e ways. But there is a manufacture which I am carrying on, and I know of none within my own reach which is &s;o valua|ble." "What can that be," &s;a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d the Squire. "To MAKE GOOD WIVES FOR WORKING MEN," &s;aid &s;he, "Is not mine an excellent &s;taple commodity?

"Sir," replied Mrs. Jones, "I have lately got ac|quainted with Mrs. White, who has given us an ac|count of her cheap di&s;hes, and wi&s;e cookery, in one of the cheap Repo&s;itory little books. Mrs. Betty and I have made all her di&s;hes, and very good they are, and we have got &s;everal others of our own. Every Friday we come here and dre&s;s one.

<P>"Pray, Mrs. Betty," &s;aid the Squire, "oblige me with a ba&s;on of your &s;oup." The Squire found it &s;o good after his walk, that he was almo&s;t &s;orry he had promi&s;ed to buy no more legs of beef, and declared a|gain, that not one &s;heep's head &s;hould ever go to his kennel again. He begged his cook might have the re|ceipt, and Mrs. Jones wrote it out for her. She has al&s;o been &s;o obliging as to favor me with a copy of all her receipts.

<HEAD>THE SUNDAY SCHOOL.</HEAD>
<P>I Promi&s;ed in the Cottage Cook to give &s;ome ac|count of the manner in which Mrs. Jones &s;et up her &s;chool. She did not much fear being able to rai&s;e the money, but money is of little u&s;e, unle&s;s &s;ome per&s;ons of &s;en&s;e and piety can be found to direct the&s;e in&s;titu|tions. Not that I would di&s;courage tho&s;e who &s;et them up even in the mo&s;t ordinary manner, or from mere views of worldly policy. It is &s;omething gained to re&s;|cue children from idling away their &s;abbath in the fields or the &s;treets. It is no &s;mall thing to keep them from tho&s;e tricks to which a day of lei&s;ure tempts the idle and the ignorant. It is &s;omething for them to be taught to read; it is much to be taught to read the Bible, and much indeed to be c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rried regularly to church. But all this is not enough. To bring the&s;e in&s;titutions to an|&s;wer their highe&s;t end can only be effected by God's ble&s;&s;ing on the following means, the choice of able teachers, and a diligent attention in &s;ome pious gentry to vi&s;it and in&s;pect the &s;chools.</P>

<HEAD>ON RECOMMENDATIONS.</HEAD>
<P>Mrs. Jones had one talent that eminently qualified her to do good, namely, judgment; this even in the gay part of her life had kept her from many mi&s;takes, but though &s;he had &s;ometimes been deceived her&s;elf, &s;he was very careful not to deceive others, in recom|mending people to fill any office either through &s;elfi&s;h|ne&s;s or fal&s;e kindne&s;s. She u&s;ed to &s;ay, "there is al|ways &s;ome one appropriate quality which every per&s;on mu&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;s, in order to fit them for any particular em|ployment.
<PB N="175" REF="035296_0269_1001C294E4721400">Even in this quality," &s;aid &s;he to Mr. Simp&s;on, the clergyman, "I do not expect perfection; but if they are de&s;titute of this, whatever good quali|ties they may po&s;&s;e&s;s be&s;ides, though they may do for &s;ome other employment, they will not do for this. If I want a pair of &s;hoes, I go to a &s;hoemaker; I do not go to a man of another trade however ingenious he may be, to a&s;k him if he cannot <HI>contrive</HI> to make me a pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">r of &s;hoes. When I lived in London, I learnt to be much on my guard as to recommendations. I found people often wanted to impo&s;e on me &s;ome one who was a burthen to them&s;elves. Once I remember when I undertook to get a matron for an ho&s;pital, half my ac|quaintance had &s;ome one to offer me. Mrs. Gib&s;on &s;ent me an old cook whom &s;he her&s;elf had di&s;charged for wa&s;ting her own provi&s;ions, yet &s;he had the con|&s;cience to recommend this woman to take care of the provi&s;ions of a large community. Mrs. Grey &s;ent me a di&s;carded hou&s;ekeeper who&s;e con&s;titution had been ruined by &s;itting up with Mrs. Grey's gouty hu&s;band, but who &s;he yet thought might do well enough to un|dergo the fatigue of taking care of an hundred poor &s;ick people. A third friend &s;ent me a woman who had no merit but that of being very poor, and it would be charity to provide for her. The truth is, the lady was obliged to allow her a &s;mall pen&s;ion till &s;he could get her off her own hands by turning her on tho&s;e of oth|ers."</P>
<P>"It is very true madam," &s;aid Mr. Simp&s;on, "the right way is always to prefer the good of the many to the good of one; if indeed it can be called doing good to any one to place them in a &s;tation in which they mu&s;t feel unhappy, by not knowing how to di&s;charge the duties of it. I will tell you how I manage. If the per&s;ons recommended are objects of charity, I private|ly &s;ub&s;cribe to their wants; I pity and help them, but I never promote them to a &s;tation for which they are
<PB N="176" REF="035296_0270_1001C29C19BA6148">unfit, and thus hurt a whole community to help a dis|tre&s;&s;ed individual."</P>
<P>Thus Mrs. Jones re&s;olved, that the fir&s;t &s;tep to|wards &s;etting up her &s;chool &s;hould be to provide a &s;uit|able mi&s;tre&s;s. The ve&s;try were &s;o earne&s;t in recom|mending one woman that &s;he thought it worth looking into. On enquiry, &s;he found it was a &s;cheme to take a large family off the pari&s;h; they never con&s;idered that a very ignorant woman, with a family of young chil|dren, was not fit for a &s;chool, all they con&s;idered was that the profits of the &s;chool might enable her to live without pari&s;h pay. Mrs. Jones refu&s;ed another, tho' &s;he could read well and was decent in her conduct, be|cau&s;e &s;he u&s;ed to &s;end her children to the &s;hop on Sun|days. And &s;he objected to a third, a very &s;en&s;ible wo|man, becau&s;e &s;he was &s;u&s;pected of making an outward profe&s;&s;ion of religion a cloak for immoral conduct.&mdash; Mrs. Jones knew &s;he mu&s;t not be too nice neither, &s;he knew &s;he mu&s;t put up wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">h many faults at la&s;t.&mdash; "I know," &s;aid &s;he to Mr. Simp&s;on, "the imperfec|tion of every thing that is human. As the mi&s;tre&s;s will have much to bear with from the children, &s;o I expect to have &s;omething to bear with in the mi&s;tre&s;s, and &s;he and I mu&s;t &s;ubmit to our re&s;pective trials, by thinking how much God has to bear with in us all. But there are three things which a mi&s;tre&s;s mu&s;t not be without, <HI>good-&s;en&s;e, activity,</HI> and <HI>piety.</HI> Without the fir&s;t &s;he will mi&s;lead others, without the &s;econd &s;he will neglect them, and without the third, though &s;he may civilize, yet &s;he will never chri&s;tianize them."</P>
<P>Mr. Simp&s;on &s;aid, "he really knew but of one per|&s;on in the pari&s;h who was fully likely to an&s;wer her purpo&s;e: this," continued he "is no other than my hou&s;e-keeper, Mrs. Betty Crew. It will indeed be a great lo&s;s to me to part from her; and to her it will be a far more fatiguing life than &s;he at pre&s;ent leads. But ought I to put my own per&s;onal comfort, or ought
<PB N="177" REF="035296_0271_1001C2A148AC90D8">Betty to put her own ea&s;e and quiet in competition with the good of above an hundred children? This will appear &s;till more important if we con&s;ider the good done, not as <HI>fruit</HI> but <HI>&s;eed;</HI> if we take into the account how many yet unborn may become chri&s;tians, in con|&s;equence of our making the&s;e children chri&s;tians. For how can we calculate the number which may be here|after trained for heaven, by tho&s;e very children we are going to teach, when they them&s;elves &s;hall become pa|rents, and you and I are dead and forgotten? To be &s;ure, by parting from Betty, my pea&s;e &s;oup will not be quite &s;o well flavored, nor my linen &s;o neatly got up; but the day is fa&s;t approaching when all this will &s;igni|fy but little; but it will not &s;ignify a little whether one hundred immortal &s;ouls were the better from my ma|king this petty &s;acrifice. Betty Crew is a real chris|tian, has excellent &s;en&s;e, and had a good education from my mother. She has al&s;o had a little &s;ort of train|ing; for when the poor children come to the par&s;on|age for the broth on a Saturday evening, Betty is u&s;ed to appoint them all to come at the &s;ame time, and after &s;he has filled their pitchers, &s;he ranges them round her in the garden, and examines them in their catechi&s;m. She is ju&s;t and fair in dealing out the broth and beef, not making my favour to the parents depend on the &s;kill of their children. But her own old caps, and rib|bons, and ca&s;t off cloaths, are be&s;towed as little re|wards on the be&s;t &s;cholars. So that taking the time &s;he &s;pends in working for them, and the things &s;he gives them, there is many a lady who does not exceed Betty in acts of charity; this I mention to confirm your notion, that it is not nece&s;&s;ary to be rich in order to do good; a religious upper &s;ervant has great opportunities of this &s;ort."</P>
<P>My readers, I tru&s;t, need not be informed, that this is that very Mrs. Betty Crew, who a&s;&s;i&s;ted Mrs. Jones in teaching poor women to cut out linen and cook
<PB N="178" REF="035296_0272_1001C2A769F374C8">cheap di&s;hes, as related in the Cottage Cook. Mrs. Jones in the following week got together as many of the mothers as &s;he could, and &s;poke to them as fol|lows:</P>

<HEAD>Mrs. Jones's Exhortation.</HEAD>
<P>My good women, on Sunday next I propo&s;e to open a &s;chool for the in&s;truction of your children.&mdash; Tho&s;e among you who know what it is to be able to read your Bible will, I doubt not, rejoice that the &s;ame ble&s;&s;ing is hold out to your children. You who are <HI>not</HI> able your&s;elves to read what your Saviour has done and &s;uffered for you, ought to be doubly anxious that your children &s;hould reap a ble&s;&s;ing which you have lo&s;t.&mdash; Would not that mother be thought an unnatural mon|&s;ter who &s;hould &s;tand by and &s;natch out of her child's mouth the bread which a kind friend had ju&s;t put into it? But &s;uch a mother would be merciful compared with her who &s;hould rob her children of the opportu|nity of learning to read the word of God when it is held out to them. Remember, that if you &s;light the pre&s;ent offer, or if after having &s;ent your children a few times you &s;hould afterwards keep them at home under vain pretences, you will have to an&s;wer for it at the day of judgment. Let not your poor children <HI>then</HI> have cau&s;e to &s;ay, "my fond mother was my wor&s;t en|emy. I might have been bred up in the fear of the Lord, and &s;he oppo&s;ed it for the &s;ake of a little paltry plea&s;ure, for an idle holiday, I am now brought to the gates of hell." My dear women, which of you could bear to &s;ee your darling child condemned to everla&s;ting de&s;truction? which of you could bear to hear him ac|cu&s;e you as the cau&s;e of it? Is there any mother here pre&s;ent who will venture to &s;ay, 'I will doom the child I bore to &s;in and hell, rather than put them or my&s;elf to a little pre&s;ent pain by curtailing their evil inclina|tions, I will let them &s;pend the Sabbath in ignorance and idlene&s;s in&s;tead of &s;ending them to &s;chool!' Let

<P>When Mrs. Jones had done &s;peaking, mo&s;t of the women thanked her for her good advice, and hoped that God would give them grace to follow it; promi|&s;ing to &s;end their children con&s;tantly. Others, who were not &s;o well di&s;po&s;ed, were yet afraid to refu&s;e, af|ter the &s;in of &s;o doing had been &s;o plainly &s;et before them. The wor&s;t of the women had kept away from this meeting, re&s;olving to &s;et their faces again&s;t the &s;chool. Mo&s;t of them who were pre&s;ent, as &s;oon as they got home &s;et about providing their children with what little decent apparel they could rai&s;e. Many a willing mother lent her tall daughter her hat, be&s;t cap, and white handkerchief, and many a grateful father &s;pared his linen wai&s;tcoat and better mo&s;t hat to induce his grown up &s;on to attend: for it was a rule with wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ch Mrs. Jones began, that &s;he would not receive the younger children out of any family who did not &s;end their elder ones.

<HEAD>SUBSCRIPTIONS.</HEAD>
<P>Mrs. Jones was very de&s;irous of getting the help and countenance of the farmers and trades-people, who&s;e duty &s;he thought it was to &s;upport a plan calcu|lated to improve the virtue and happine&s;s of the pari&s;h. Mo&s;t of them &s;ub&s;cribed, and promi&s;ed to &s;ee that
<PB N="180" REF="035296_0274_1001C2B4EA5F9860">their workmen &s;ent their children. She met with lit|tle oppo&s;ition till &s;he called on farmer Ho&s;kins. She told him as he was the riche&s;t farmer in the pari&s;h, &s;he came to him for a hand&s;ome &s;ub&s;cription. "Sub&s;crip|tion!" &s;aid he, "it is nothing but &s;ub&s;criptions I think; a man had need be made of money." "Farmer," &s;aid Mrs. Jones, "God has ble&s;&s;ed you with abundant pros|perity, and he expects you &s;hould be liberal in propor|tion to your great ability." "I do not know what you mean by ble&s;&s;ing," &s;aid he; "I have been up early and late, lived hard while I had little, and now when I thought I had got forward in the world, what with tythes and &s;ub&s;criptions it all goes I think." "Mr. Ho&s;kins," &s;aid Mrs. Jones, "this is but an ungrateful return for all your ble&s;&s;ings." "You are again at your ble&s;&s;ings," &s;aid the Farmer, "but let every one work as hard as I have done and I dare &s;ay he will do as well. It is to my own indu&s;try I owe what I have. My crops have been good becau&s;e I minded my ploughing and &s;owing." "Oh, farmer!" cried Mrs. Jones, "you forget who&s;e &s;uns and &s;howers make your crops to grow; but I do not come here to preach but to beg." "Well, madam, what is it now? Flann<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l or French? or weavers, or a new church, or large bread, or cheap rice? or what other new whim-wham for getting the money out of one's pocket?" "I am going to e&s;tabli&s;h a Sunday &s;chool, farmer, and I come to you as one of the principal inhabitants, hoping your example will &s;pur on the re&s;t to give." "Why then," &s;aid the far|mer, "as one of the principal inhabitan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s, I will give nothing, hoping it will &s;pur on the re&s;t to refu&s;e. Of all the fooli&s;h inventions, and new fangled devices to ruin the country, that of teaching the poor to read is the very wor&s;t." "And I, farmer, think that to teach good principles to the lower cla&s;&s;es is the mo&s;t likely way to &s;ave the country. Now in order to this we mu&s;t teach them to read," "Not with my con&s;ent nor
<PB N="181" REF="035296_0275_1001C2BEB08687F8">my money," &s;aid the farmer, "for I know it always does more harm than good." "So it may," &s;aid Mrs. Jones, "if you only teach them to read and then turn them adrift to find out books for them&s;elves. There is a pronene&s;s in the heart to evil which it is our duty to counteract, and which I &s;ee you are promoting. Only look round your own kitchen, I am a&s;hamed to &s;ee it hung round with loo&s;e &s;ongs and ballads. I grant in|deed, it would be better for your men and maids, and even your daughters, not to be able to read at all than to read &s;uch &s;tuff as this. But if when they a&s;k for bread you will give them a &s;tone, nay wor&s;e, a &s;erpent, yours is the blame." Then taking up a penny book which had a very loo&s;e title, &s;he went on, "I do not wonder if you, who read &s;uch books as the&s;e, think it &s;afer that people &s;hould not read at all." The farmer grinned, and &s;aid "it is hard if a man of my &s;ub&s;tance may not divert my&s;elf; when a bit of fun co&s;ts only a penny, and a man can &s;pare that penny, there is no harm done. When it is very hot, or very wet, and I come in to re&s;t and have drank my mug of cider, I like to take up a bit of a je&s;t book or a comical &s;tory to make me laugh." "Oh, Mr. Ho&s;kins," replied Mrs. Jones, "when you come in to re&s;t from a burning &s;un or &s;how|er, do you never think of him who&s;e &s;un it is that is ri|pening your corn? or who&s;e &s;hower is filling the ear or cau&s;ing the gra&s;s to grow? I could tell you of &s;ome books which would &s;trengthen &s;uch thoughts, whereas &s;uch as you read only &s;erve to put them out of your head." Mrs. Jones having taken pains to let Mr. Hos|kins know, that all the genteel and wealthy people had &s;ub&s;cribed, he at la&s;t &s;aid, "Why, as to the matter of that I do not value a crown; only I think it might be better be&s;towed, and I am afraid my own workmen will fly in my face if once they are made &s;cholars, and that they will think them&s;elves too good to work."&mdash;"Now "Now you talk &s;oberly and give your rea&s;ons," &s;aid
<PB N="182" REF="035296_0276_1001A3C61D413E18">Mrs. Jones, "weak as they are, they de&s;erve an an|&s;wer. Do you think that either man, woman, or child ever did his duty the wor&s;e, only becau&s;e he knew it the better?" "No, perhaps not." "Now the whole ex|tent of learning which we intend to give the poor, is only to enable them to read the Bible, a book in which every duty is explained, every doctrine brought into practice, and the brighte&s;t truths made level to the meane&s;t under&s;tanding. The knowledge of that book and its practical influence on the heart is the be&s;t &s;ecu|rity you can have both for the indu&s;try and obedience of your &s;ervants. Now can you think any man will be the wor&s;e &s;ervant for being a good chri&s;tian?" "Per|haps not." "Are not the duties of children, of &s;erv|ants, and the poor expre&s;sly &s;et forth in the Bible?"&mdash;"Yes." "Do you think any duties are likely to be &s;o well performed from any human motives, &s;uch as fear or prudence, as from the&s;e religious motives which are backed with the &s;anctions of rewards and puni&s;hments, of heaven or hell? Even upon your own principles of worldly policy, do you think a poor man is not le&s;s like|ly to &s;teal a &s;heep or a hor&s;e, who was taught when a boy, that it was a &s;in to rob a hen roo&s;t or an orchard? Will your property be &s;ecured &s;o effectually by the &s;tocks on the green, as by teaching the boys in the &s;chool, that <HI>for all the&s;e things God will bring them into judgment?</HI> Is a poor fellow who can read his Bible &s;o likely to &s;leep or to drink away his few hours of lei&s;ure as one who <HI>cannot</HI> read? He may, and he often does make a bad u&s;e of his reading, but I doubt he would have been as bad without it. And the hours &s;pent in learning to read will always have been among the mo&s;t harmle&s;s ones of his life."</P>
<P>"Well madam," &s;aid the farmer, "if you do not think that religion will &s;poil my young &s;ervants, I do not care if you do put me down for half a guinea. What has farmer Dob&s;on given?" "Half a guinea," &s;aid
<PB N="183" REF="035296_0277_1001C2C91F8EA0E8">Mrs. Jones. "Well," cried the farmer, "it &s;hall ne|ver be &s;aid I did not give more than he, who is only a renter. Dob&s;on give half a guinea? Why he wears his coat as thread-bare as a laborer." "Perhaps," re|plied Mrs. Jones, "that is one rea&s;on why he gives &s;o much." "Well, put me down a guinea," cried the farmer. "As &s;carce as guineas are ju&s;t now, I'll never be put upon the &s;ame footing with Dob&s;on nei|ther." "Yes, and you mu&s;t exert your&s;elf be&s;ides in in&s;i&s;ting that your workmen &s;end their children, and of|ten look into the &s;chool your&s;elf to &s;ee if they are there, and reward or di&s;courage them accordingly," added Mrs. Jones, as &s;he took her leave. The farmer in&s;i&s;t|ed in waiting on her to the door. When they got in|to the yard, they &s;pied Mr. Simp&s;on, who was &s;tand|ing near a little group of females, con&s;i&s;ting of the farmer's two young daughters, and a couple of ro&s;y dairy maids, and old blind fidler, and a woman who led him. The woman had laid a ba&s;ket on the ground, out of which &s;he was dealing &s;ome &s;ongs to the girls, who were kneeling round it, and eagerly picking out &s;uch who&s;e titles &s;uited their ta&s;tes. On &s;eeing the clergyman come up, the fiddler's companion (for I am &s;orry to &s;ay &s;he was not his wife) pu&s;hed &s;ome of the &s;ongs to the bottom of the ba&s;ket, turned round to the company, and in a whining tone, a&s;ked "if they would plea&s;e to buy a godly book." Mr. Simp&s;on &s;aw thro' the hypocri&s;y at once, and in&s;tead of making any an|&s;wer, took out of one of the girl's hands, a &s;ong which the woman had not been able to &s;natch away. He was &s;hocked and grieved to &s;ee that the&s;e young girls were about to read, to &s;ing, and to learn by heart &s;uch rib|aldry, as he was a&s;hamed even to ca&s;t his eyes on. He turned about to the girl and gravely, but mildly &s;aid, "young woman, what do you think &s;hould be done to a per&s;on who &s;hould be found carrying a box of poi&s;on round the country, and leaving a little at every hou&s;e?".
<PB N="184" REF="035296_0278_1001C2D1DF53A358">The girls all agreed that &s;uch a per&s;on ought to be hanged; "that the &s;hould," &s;aid the farmer, "if I was upon the jury." The fiddler and his woman were of the &s;ame opinion, declaring <HI>they</HI> would not do &s;uch a wicked thing for the world, for if they were poor they were hone&s;t. Mr. Simp&s;on, turning to the other girl, &s;aid, "which is of mo&s;t value, the &s;oul or the body?" "The &s;oul &s;ir;" &s;aid the girl. "Why &s;o?" &s;aid he, "becau&s;e &s;ir, I have heard you &s;ay in the pulpit, the &s;oul is to la&s;t for ever." Then cried Mr. Simp&s;on, in a &s;tern voice, turning to the fiddler's woman, "are not you a&s;hamed to &s;ell poi&s;on for that part which is to la&s;t for ever? poi&s;on for the &s;oul?" "Poi&s;on!" &s;aid the terrified girl, throwing down the book, and &s;hudder|ing as people do who are afraid they have touched &s;omething infectious. "Poi&s;on!" echoed the farmer's daughters, recollecting with horror the rat&s;bane which Lion, the old hou&s;e dog had got at the day before, and after eating which, they had &s;een him drop down dead in convul&s;ions. "Yes," &s;aid Mr. Simp&s;on to the woman, "I do again repeat, the &s;ouls of the&s;e in|nocent girls will be poi&s;oned, and may be eternally ru|ined by this vile tra&s;h which you carry about."</P>
<P>"I now &s;ee," &s;aid Mrs. Jones to the farmer, "the rea&s;on why you think learning to read does more harm than good. It is indeed far better that they &s;hould ne|ver know how to tell a letter, unle&s;s you keep &s;uch tra&s;h as this out of their way, and provide them with what is good or what is harmle&s;s. Still this is not the fault of reading, but the abu&s;e of it. Wine is &s;till a good cordial, though it is too often abu&s;ed to the pur|po&s;e of drunkenne&s;s.</P>
<P>The farmer &s;aid that neither of his maids could read their horn book, though he owned he often heard them &s;inging that &s;ong which the par&s;on had thought &s;o bad, but for his part it made him as merry as a nightingale.</P>
<P>"Yes," &s;aid Mrs. Jones, "as a proof that it is not
<PB N="185" REF="035296_0279_1001A3C8065BCEC0">merely being able to read which does the mi&s;chief. I have often heard as I have been cro&s;&s;ing a hay-field, young girls &s;inging &s;uch indecent ribaldry as has driven me out of the field, though I well knew they could not read a line of what they were &s;inging, but had caught it from others. So you &s;ee you may as well &s;ay the me|mory is a wicked talent becau&s;e &s;ome people mi&s;apply it, as to &s;ay that reading is dangerous, becau&s;e &s;ome folks abu&s;e it."</P>
<P>While they were talking, the fiddler and his woman were trying to &s;teal away, but Mr. Simp&s;on &s;topped them and &s;aid, "woman, I &s;hall have &s;ome farther talk with you. I am a magi&s;trate as well as a mini&s;ter, and if I know it, I will no more allow a wicked book to be &s;old in my pari&s;h than a do&s;e of poi&s;on." The girls threw away all their &s;ongs, thanked Mr. Simp&s;on, beg|ged Mrs. Jones would take them into her &s;chool after the had done milking in the evenings, that they might learn to read only what was proper. They promi&s;ed they would never more deal with any but &s;ober, hone&s;t hawkers, &s;uch as &s;ell good little books, chri&s;tmas car|rols, and harmle&s;s &s;ongs, and de&s;ired the &s;iddler's wo|man never to call there again.</P>
<P>This little incident afterwards confirmed Mrs. Jones in a plan &s;he had before &s;ome thoughts of putting in practice. This was, after her &s;chool had been es|tabli&s;hed a few months, to invite all the well-di&s;po&s;ed grown-up youth of the pari&s;h to meet her at the &s;chool an hour or two on a Sunday evening, after the nece&s;&s;a|ry bu&s;ine&s;s of the dairy and of &s;erving the cattle was over. Both Mrs. Jones and her agent had the talent of making this time pa&s;s &s;o agreeably by their manner of explaining &s;cripture, and of impre&s;&s;ing the heart by &s;erious and affectionate di&s;cour&s;e, that in a &s;hort time the evening &s;chool was nearly filled with a &s;econd com|pany after the younger ones were di&s;mi&s;&s;ed. In time, not only the &s;ervants, but the &s;ons and daughters of
<PB N="186" REF="035296_0280_1001C2DAAB9C90E8">the mo&s;t &s;ub&s;tantial people in the pari&s;h attended. At length, many of the parents, plea&s;ed with the improve|ment &s;o vi&s;ible in the young people, got a habit of drop|ping in, that they might learn how to in&s;truct their own families. And it was ob&s;erved that as the &s;chool filled, not only the fives-court and public hou&s;e were thinned, but even Sunday go&s;&s;iping and tea vi&s;iting de|clined. Even Farmer Ho&s;kins, who was at fir&s;t angry with his maids for learning of tho&s;e <HI>merry</HI> &s;ongs as he called them, was &s;o plea&s;ed by the manner in which the p&s;alms were &s;ung at the &s;chool, that he promi&s;ed Mrs. Jones to make her a pre&s;ent of half a &s;heep to|wards her fir&s;t May-day fea&s;t. Of this fea&s;t &s;ome ac|count &s;hall be given hereafter, and the reader may ex|pect &s;ome further account of the Sunday School next month in the Hi&s;tory of He&s;ter Wilmot.</P>

<HEAD>THE HISTORY OF HESTER WILMOT; OR, THE SECOND PART OF THE <HI>SUNDAY SCHOOL.</HI></HEAD>
<P>HESTER WILMOT was born in the pari&s;h of We&s;ton, of parents who maintained them&s;elves
<PB N="187" REF="035296_0281_1001C2DF95C6F380">by their labor, they were both of them ungodly, it is no wonder therefore they were unhappy. They lived badly together, and how could they do otherwi&s;e, for their tempers were very different, and they had no re|ligion to &s;mooth down this difference, or to teach them that they ought to bear with each other's faults. Re|becca Wilmot was a proof that people may have &s;ome right qualities, and yet be but bad characters. She was clean, notable, and indu&s;trious. Now I know &s;ome folks fancy that the poor who have the&s;e qualities, need have no other; but this is a &s;ad mi&s;take, as I am &s;ure every page in the Bible would &s;hew; and it is a pity people do not con&s;ult it oftener. Rebecca was of a vi|olent ungovernable temper; and that very neatne&s;s which is in it&s;elf &s;o plea&s;ing, in her became a &s;in, for her affection to her hu&s;band and children was quite lo&s;t in an over anxious de&s;ire to have her hou&s;e reckoned the nice&s;t in the pari&s;h. Rebecca was al&s;o a proof that a poor woman may be as vain as a rich one, for it was not &s;o much the comfort of neatne&s;s, as the prai&s;e of neatne&s;s which &s;he coveted. A &s;pot on her hearth, or a bit of ru&s;t on a bra&s;s candle&s;tick would throw her in|to a violent pa&s;&s;ion. Now it is very right to keep the hearth clean and the candle&s;tick bright, but it is very wrong &s;o to &s;et one's affections on a hearth or a candle|&s;tick as to make one&s;elf unhappy if any trifling accident happens to them; and if Rebecca had been as careful to keep her heart without &s;pot or her life without blem|i&s;h, as &s;he was to keep her fire-irons free from either, &s;he would have been held up in this hi&s;tory, not as a warning, but a pattern, and in that ca&s;e her nicety would have come in for a part of the prai&s;e. It was no fault in Rebecca but a merit, that her oak table was &s;o bright you could almo&s;t &s;ee to put your cap on init; but it was no merit but a fault that when John, her hus|band, laid down his cup of beer upon it &s;o as to leave a mark, &s;he would fly out into &s;o terrible a pa&s;&s;ion that
<PB N="188" REF="035296_0282_1001C2E3C3ECD648">all the children were forced to run to corners; now poor John having no corner to run to, ran to the al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">-hou&s;e, till that which was at fir&s;t a refuge, too &s;oon be|came a plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>Rebecca never wi&s;hed her children to learn to read becau&s;e &s;he &s;aid it would only &s;erve to make them lazy, and &s;he her&s;elf had done very well without it. She would keep poor He&s;ter from church to &s;tone the &s;pace under the chairs in fine patterns and whim-whams. I don't pretend to &s;ay there was any harm in this little decoration, it looks pretty enough, and it is better to let the children do that than do nothing. But &s;till the&s;e are not things to &s;et one's heart upon, and be&s;ides, Re|becca only did it as a trap for prai&s;e; for &s;he was &s;ulky, and di&s;appointed if any ladies happened to call in and did not &s;eem delighted with the flowers which &s;he u&s;ed to draw with a burnt &s;tick on the white wa&s;h of the chimney corners. Be&s;ides all this finery was often done on a Sunday, and there is a great deal of harm in do|ing right things at a wrong time, or in wa&s;ting much time on things which are of no real u&s;e, or in doing any thing at all out of vanity. Now I beg that no lazy &s;lat|tern of a wife will go and take any comfort in her dirt from what is here &s;aid again&s;t Rebecca's nicety; for I believe that for one who makes her hu&s;band unhappy through neatne&s;s, twenty do &s;o by dirt and lazine&s;s.&mdash;All exce&s;&s;es are wrong, but the exce&s;s of a good quali|ty is not &s;o common as the exce&s;s of a bad one.</P>
<P>John Wilmot was not an ill-natured man, but he had no fixed principle. In&s;tead of &s;etting him&s;elf to cure his wife's faults by mild reproof and a good exam|ple, he was driven by them into &s;till greater faults him|&s;elf. It is a common ca&s;e with people who have no religion, when any cro&s;s accident befals them, in&s;tead of trying to make the be&s;t of a bad matter, in&s;tead of con&s;idering their trouble as a trial &s;ent from God to purify them, or in&s;tead of con&s;idering the faults of o|thers
<PB N="189" REF="035296_0283_1001C2E8F3860870">as a puni&s;hment for their own &s;ins, what do they do but either &s;ink down at once into de&s;pair, or el&s;e run for comfort into evil cour&s;es. Drinking is the common remedy for &s;orrow, if that can be called a re|medy, the end of which is to de&s;troy &s;oul and body.&mdash;John now began to &s;pend all his lei&s;ure hours at the Bell. He u&s;ed to be fond of his children, but when he found he could not come home in quiet and play with the little ones, while his wife dre&s;&s;ed him a bit of hot &s;upper, he grew in time not to come home at all. He who has once taken to drink can &s;eldom be &s;aid to be guilty of one &s;in only; John's heart became hardened. His affection for his family was lo&s;t in &s;elf-indulgence. Patience and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion on the part of his wife might have won much upon a man of John's temper, but in&s;tead of trying to reclaim him, his wife &s;eemed rather to de|light in putting him as much in the wrong as &s;he could, that &s;he might be ju&s;tified in her con&s;tant abu&s;e of him. I doubt whether &s;he would have been as much plea&s;ed with his reformation as &s;he was with always talking of his faults, though I know it was the opinion of the neighbors, that if &s;he had taken as much pains to reform her hu&s;band by reforming her own temper, as &s;he did to abu&s;e him and expo&s;e him, her endeavors might have been ble&s;&s;ed with &s;ucce&s;s. Good people, who are try|ing to &s;ubdue their own faults, can hardly believe that the ungodly have a &s;ort of &s;avage &s;atisfaction in trying, by the indulgence of their own evil tempers, to le&s;&s;en the happine&s;s of tho&s;e with whom they have to do.&mdash;Need we look any farther for a proof of our own cor|rupt nature, when we &s;ee mankind delight in &s;ins which have neither the temptation of profit or plea&s;ure, &s;uch as plaguing, vexing, or abu&s;ing each other.</P>
<P>He&s;ter was the elde&s;t of their five children, &s;he was a &s;harp, &s;en&s;ible girl, but at fourteen years old &s;he could not tell a letter, nor had &s;he ever been taught to bow her knee to him who made her, for John's or rather
<PB N="190" REF="035296_0284_1001C2EE714FF278">Rebecca's hou&s;e, had &s;eldom the name of God pro|nounced in it, except to be bla&s;phemed.</P>
<P>It was ju&s;t about this time, if I mi&s;take not, that Mrs. Jones &s;et up her Sunday &s;chool, of which Mrs. Betty Crew was appointed mi&s;tre&s;s, as was related la&s;t month. Mrs. Jones finding that none of the Wilmots were &s;ent to &s;chool, took a walk to Rebecca's hou&s;e, and civilly told her &s;he called to let her know that a &s;chool was opened to which &s;he de&s;ired her to &s;end her children on the Sunday following, e&s;pecially her elde&s;t daughter He&s;ter. "Well," &s;aid Rebecca, "and what will you give her if I do?" "Give her!" replied Mrs. Jones, "that is rather a rude que&s;tion, and a&s;k|ed in a rude manner: however, as <HI>a &s;oft an&s;wer turn|eth away wrath,</HI> I a&s;&s;ure you that I will give her the be&s;t of learning; I will teach her to <HI>fear God and keep his commandments."</HI> "I would rather you would teach her to fear me, and to keep my hou&s;e clean," &s;aid this wicked woman. "She &s;han't come, however, unle&s;s you will pay her for it." "Pay her for it," &s;aid the la|dy, "will it not be reward enough that &s;he will be taught to read the word of God without any expence to you? For though many gifts both of books and cloathing will be given the children, yet you are not to con&s;ider the&s;e gifts &s;o much in the light of payment as an expre&s;&s;ion of good will in your benefactors." "I &s;ay," interrupted Rebecca, "that He&s;ter &s;han't go to &s;chool. Religion is of no u&s;e that I know of, but to make people hate their own fle&s;h and blood; and I &s;ee no good in learning but to make folks proud, and lazy, and dirty. I cannot tell a letter my&s;elf, and, though I &s;ay it that &s;hould not &s;ay it, there is not a notabler wo|man in the pari&s;h." "Pray," &s;aid Mrs. Jones mildly, "do you think that young people will di&s;obey their pa|rents the more for being taught to fear God?" "I don't think any thing about it," &s;aid Rebecca, "I &s;han't let her come, and there's the long and &s;hort of the mat|ter.
<PB N="191" REF="035296_0285_1001C2F61F752D48">He&s;ter has other fi&s;h to fry; but you may have &s;ome of the&s;e little ones if you will?" "No," &s;aid Mrs. Jones, "I will not; I have not &s;et up a nur&s;ery but a &s;chool. I am not at all this expence to take cry|ing babes out of the mother's way, but to in&s;truct rea|&s;onable b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ings. And it ought to be a rule in all &s;chools not to take the trouble&s;ome young children unle&s;s the mother will try to &s;pare the elder ones, who are capa|ble of learning." "But," &s;aid Rebecca, "I have a young child which He&s;ter mu&s;t nur&s;e while I dre&s;s dinner. And the mu&s;t iron the rags, and &s;cour the irons, and dig the potatoes, and fetch the water to boil them." "As to nur&s;ing the child, that is indeed a nece&s;&s;ary duty, and He&s;ter ought to &s;tay at home part of the day to enable you to go to church; and families &s;hould relieve each other in this way, but as to all the re&s;t they are no rea|&s;ons at all, for the irons need not be &s;coured &s;o often, and the rags &s;hould be ironed and the potatoes dug, and the water fetched on the Saturday, and I can tell you that neither your mini&s;ter here, nor your judge hereaf|ter, will accept of any &s;uch excu&s;es."</P>
<P>All this while He&s;ter &s;taid behind, pale and trem|bling, le&s;t her unkind mother &s;hould carry her point&mdash;She looked up at Mrs. Jones with &s;o much love and gratitude as to win her affection, and this good lady went on trying to &s;often this har&s;h mother. At la&s;t Re|becca conde&s;cended to &s;ay, "well, I don't know but I may let her come now and then when I can &s;pare her, provided I find you make it worth her while." All this time &s;he had never a&s;ked Mrs. Jones to &s;it down, nor had once bid her young children be quiet, though they were crying and &s;qualling the whole time. Rebecca fancied this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">dene&s;s was the only way &s;he had of &s;hew|ing &s;he thought her&s;elf as good as her gue&s;t, but Mrs. Jones never lo&s;t her temper. The moment &s;he went out of the hou&s;e, Rebecca called our loud enough for her to hear, and ordered He&s;ter to get the &s;tone and a
<PB N="192" REF="035296_0286_1001C2F8EF1DCC50">bit of &s;and to &s;crub out the prints of that dirty woman's &s;hoes. He&s;ter, in high &s;pirits, cheerfully obeyed, and rubbed out the &s;tains &s;o neatly, that her mother could not help lamenting that &s;o handy a girl was going to be &s;poiled by being taught godline&s;s, and learning, and &s;uch non&s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>Mrs. Jones, who knew the world, told her agent, Mrs. Crew, that her grand difficulty would ari&s;e not &s;o much from the children as the parents. "The&s;e," &s;aid &s;he, "are apt to fall into that &s;ad mi&s;take, that becau&s;e their children are poor and have little of this world's goods, the mothers mu&s;t make it up to them in fal&s;e in|dulgence. The children of the gentry are much more reproved and corrected for their faults, and bred up in far &s;tricter di&s;cipline. He was a King who &s;aid, <HI>chas|ten thy &s;on, and let not thy rod &s;pare for his crying.</HI>&mdash;But the more vicious the children are, you mu&s;t re|member the more they &s;tand in need of your in&s;truction. When they are bad, comfort your&s;elf with thinking how much wor&s;e they would have been but for you; and what a burthen they would become to &s;ociety if the&s;e evil tempers were to receive no check." The great thing which enabled Mrs. Crew to teach well, was, the deep in&s;ight &s;he had got into the corruption of human nature. And I doubt if any one can make a thoroughly good teacher of religion and morals who wants this ma&s;ter-key to the heart. Others, indeed, may teach knowledge, decency, and good manners.&mdash;Mrs. Crew who knew that out of the heart proceed lying, theft, and all that train of evils which begin to break out even in young children, applied her la|bors to correct this root of evil. But though a diligent, &s;he was an humble teacher, well knowing that unle&s;s the grace of God ble&s;&s;ed her labors, &s;he &s;hould but la|bor in vain.</P>
<P>He&s;ter Wilmot never failed to attend the &s;chool, whenever her perver&s;e mother would give her leave,
<PB N="193" REF="035296_0287_1001A3D7DC06A308">and her delight in learning was &s;o great, that &s;he would work early and late to gain a little time for her book. As &s;he had a quick capacity, &s;he learned &s;oon to &s;pell and read, and Mrs. Crew ob&s;erving her diligence, u&s;ed to lend her a book to carry home, that &s;he might pick up a little at odd times. It would be well if teachers would make this di&s;tinction. To give or lend books to tho&s;e who take no delight in them is an u&s;ele&s;s ex|pen&s;e; while it is kind and right to a&s;&s;i&s;t well di&s;po&s;ed young people with every help of this &s;ort. Tho&s;e who love books &s;eldom hurt them, while the &s;lothful who hate learning, will wear out a book more in a week than the diligent will do in a year. He&s;ter's way was to read over one que&s;tion in her catechi&s;m, or one ver&s;e in her hymn book, by fire-light before &s;he went to bed; this &s;he thought over in the night, and when &s;he was dre&s;&s;ing her&s;elf in the morning &s;he was glad to find &s;he always knew a little more than &s;he had done the morn|ing before. It is not to be believed how much tho&s;e people will be found to have gained at the end of a year, who are accu&s;tomed to work up all the little odd ends and remnants of time; who are convinced that minutes are no more to be wa&s;ted than pence. Nay, he who finds he was wa&s;ted a &s;hilling may by diligence hope to fetch it up again; but no repentance or indus|try can ever bring back one wa&s;ted hour. My good young reader, if ever you are tempted to wa&s;te an hour, go and a&s;k a dying man what he would give for that hour which you are throwing away, and according as he an&s;wers, &s;o do you act.</P>
<P>As her mother hated the &s;ight of a book, He&s;ter was forced to learn out of &s;ight: it was no di&s;obedience to do this, as long as &s;he wa&s;ted no part of that time which it was her duty to &s;pend in u&s;eful labor. She would have thought it a &s;in to have left her work for her book; but &s;he did not think it wrong to &s;teal time from her &s;leep, and to be learning an hour before the re&s;t of the
<PB N="194" REF="035296_0288_1001C131DF82D178">family were awake. He&s;ter would not neglect the wa&s;hing-tub, or the &s;pinning-wheel, even to get on with her catechi&s;m; but &s;he thought it fair to think over her que&s;tions, while &s;he was wa&s;hing and &s;pin|ning. In a few months &s;he was able to read fluently in St. John's go&s;pel, which is the ea&s;ie&s;t. But Mrs. Crew did not think it enough that her children could read a chapter, &s;he would make them under&s;tand it al|&s;o. It is in a good degree owing to the want of reli|gious knowledge in teachers that there is &s;o little reli|gion in the world. Unle&s;s the bible is laid open to the under&s;tanding, children may read from Gene&s;is to the Revelation, without any other improvement than bare|ly learning how to pronounce the words. Mrs. Crew found that there was but one way to compel their at|tention: this was by obliging them to return back again to her the &s;en&s;e of what &s;he had read to them, and this they might do in their own words, if they could not re|member the words of &s;cripture. Tho&s;e who had weak capacities would, to be &s;ure, do this but very imperfect|ly; but even the weake&s;t if they were willing would retain &s;omething. She &s;o managed that &s;aying the cat|echi&s;m was not merely an act of the memory, but of the under&s;tanding; for &s;he had ob&s;erved formerly, that tho&s;e who had learned the catechi&s;m in the common formal way, when they were children, had never under&s;tood it when they became men and women, and it remained in the memory without having made any impre&s;&s;ion on the mind. Thus this fine &s;ummary of the chri&s;tian re|ligion is con&s;idered as little more than a form of words, the being able to repeat which, is a qualification for being confirmed by the bi&s;hop, in&s;tead of being con&s;i|dered as really containing tho&s;e grounds of chri&s;tian faith and practice, by which they are to be confirmed chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>Mrs. Crew u&s;ed to &s;ay to Mrs. Jones, "tho&s;e who teach the poor mu&s;t indeed give line upon line, precept
<PB N="195" REF="035296_0289_1001C30947D5B4F0">upon precept, here a little and there a little, as they can receive it. So that teaching mu&s;t be a great grievance to tho&s;e who do not really make it a labor of love. I &s;ee &s;o much levity, ob&s;tinacy, and ignorance, that it keeps my own forbearance in continual exerci&s;e, &s;o that I cru&s;t I am getting good my&s;elf while I am doing good to others. No one, madam, can know till they try, that after they have a&s;ked a poor untaught child the &s;ame que&s;tion nineteen times, they mu&s;t not lo&s;e their temper, but go on and a&s;k it the twentieth. Now and then, when I am tempted to be impatient, I correct my&s;elf, by thinking over that active proof which our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour requires of our love to him when he &s;ays, <HI>feed my lambs.</HI></P>
<P>He&s;ter Wilmot had never been bred to go to church, for her father and mother had never thought for going them&s;elves, unle&s;s at a chri&s;tening in their own family, or at a funeral of their neighbors, both of which they con&s;idered merely as opportunities for good eating and drinking, and not as offices of religion.</P>
<P>As poor He&s;ter had no comfort at home, it was the le&s;s wonder &s;he delighted in her &s;chool, her bible and church, for &s;o great is God's goodne&s;s, that he is pleas|ed to make religion a peculiar comfort to tho&s;e who have no other comfort. The God who&s;e name &s;he had &s;eldom heard but when it was <HI>taken in vain,</HI> was now revealed to her as a God of infinite power, jus|tice, and holine&s;s. What &s;he read in her bible, and what &s;he felt in her own heart, convinced her &s;he was a &s;inner; and her catechi&s;m &s;aid the &s;ame.

<PB N="196" REF="035296_0290_1001A3DF444A6768">which &s;he was bound to perform. She was &s;ad|ly puzzled to know how this was to be done, till &s;he met with the&s;e words in her bible. <HI>My grace is &s;uffi|cient for thee.</HI> But &s;till &s;he was at a lo&s;s to know how this grace was to be obtained. Happily Mr. Simp&s;on preached on the next Sunday from this text, <HI>A&s;k and ye &s;hall have,</HI> &amp;c. In this &s;ermon was explained to her the nature, the duty, and the efficacy of prayer. After this &s;he opened her heart to Mrs. Crew, who taught her the great doctrines of Scripture in a &s;erious, but plain way. He&s;ter's own heart led her to a&s;&s;ent to that humbling doctrine of the catechi&s;m, that <HI>we are by na|ture born in &s;in;</HI> and truly glad was &s;he to be relieved by hearing or <HI>that &s;piritual grace by which we have a new birth unto righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> Thus her mind was no &s;ooner humbled by one part, than it gained comfort from another. On the other hand, while &s;he was re|joicing in a <HI>lively hope of God's mercy through Chri&s;t,</HI> her mi&s;tre&s;s put her in mind that that was the only true repentance, <HI>by which we for&s;ake &s;in.</HI> Thus the cate|chi&s;m explained by a pious teacher was found to contain <HI>all the articles of the chri&s;tian faith.</HI></P>
<P>Mrs. Jones greatly di&s;approved the practice of turn|ing away the &s;cholars, becau&s;e they were grown up&mdash; "Young people," &s;aid &s;he, "want to be warned at &s;ix|teen more than they did at &s;ix, and they are commonly turned adrift at the very age when they want mo&s;t in|&s;truction; when dangers and temptations mo&s;t be&s;et them. They are expo&s;ed to more evil by the lei&s;ure of a Sunday evening than by the bu&s;ine&s;s of the whole week: but then religion mu&s;t be made plea&s;ant, and in&s;truction mu&s;t be carried in a kind, and agreeable, and familiar way. If they once di&s;like the teacher they will &s;oon get to di&s;like that is taught, &s;o that a mas|ter or mi&s;tre&s;s is in &s;ome mea&s;ure an&s;werable for the future piety of young per&s;ons, ina&s;much as that piety depends on their manner of making religion plea&s;ant as
<PB N="197" REF="035296_0291_1001C311F77F1B88">well as profitable." To attend Mrs. Jones's evening in&s;tructions was &s;oon thought not a ta&s;k but a holiday. In a few months it was reckoned a di&s;advantage to the character of any young per&s;on in the pari&s;h to know they did not attend the evening &s;chool. At fir&s;t, indeed, many of them came only with a view to learn to &s;ing p&s;alms; but, by the ble&s;&s;ing of God, they grew fond of in&s;truction, and &s;ome of them became truly pious&mdash; Mrs. Jones &s;poke to them one Sunday evening as fol|lows: "My dear young women, I rejoice at your im|provement; but I rejoice with trembling. I have known young people &s;et out well, who afterwards fell off. The heart is deceitful. Many like religious know|ledge, who do not like the &s;trictne&s;s of a religious life. I mu&s;t therefore watch whether tho&s;e who are diligent at church and &s;chool are diligent in their daily walk.&mdash; Whether tho&s;e who &s;ay they believe in God, really o|bey him. Whether they who profe&s;s to love Chri&s;t keep his commandments. Tho&s;e who hear them&s;elves commended for early piety, may learn to re&s;t &s;atisfied with the prai&s;e of man. People may get a knack at re|ligious phra&s;es without being religious; they may even get to frequent places of wor&s;hip as an amu&s;ement, in order to meet their friends, and may learn to delight in a &s;ort <HI>&s;piritual go&s;&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">p,</HI> while religion has no power in their hearts.

<P>HESTER Wilmot, I am &s;orry to ob&s;erve, had been by natures peevi&s;h and lazy, &s;he would now and then &s;light her work, and when her mother was very unrea&s;onable &s;he was too apt to return her a &s;aucy an&s;wer, but when &s;he became acquainted with her own heart, and with the Scriptures, the&s;e evil tempers were in a good mea&s;ure &s;ubdued, for &s;he now learnt to imitate, not her violent mother, but <HI>him who was meek and lowly.</HI> When &s;he was &s;colded for doing ill, &s;he prayed for grace do better; and the only an&s;wer &s;he made to her mother's charge, "that religion only &s;erved to make people lazy," was to &s;trive to do twice as much work, in order to prove that it really made them diligent.&mdash; The only thing in which &s;he ventured to di&s;obey her mother was, that when &s;he ordered her to do week-days' work on a Sunday, He&s;ter cried, and &s;aid, "&s;he did not dare di&s;obey God," but to &s;how that &s;he did not wi&s;h to &s;ave her own labor, &s;he would do a double portion of work on the Saturday night, and ri&s;e two hours earlier on the Monday morning.</P>

Once when &s;he had worked very hard, her mother told her &s;he would treat her with a holiday the following Sabbath, and take her a fine walk to eat cakes and drink ale <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t We&s;ton fair, which, though it was profe&s;&s;ed to be kept on the Monday, yet, to the di&s;grace of the village, always began on the Sunday evening. Rebecca, who would on no account have wa&s;ted the Monday, which was a working day, in idlene&s;s and plea&s;ure, thought &s;he had a very good right to enjoy her&s;elf at the fair on the Sunday evening, as well as to take her children.&mdash; He&s;ter earne&s;tly begged to be left at home, and her mo|th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> in a rage, went without her.

And though &s;he &s;ecretly prayed to God that this &s;ickne&s;s might change her mo|ther's heart, yet &s;he never once reproached her, or put her in mind, that it was caught by indulging in a &s;in|ful plea&s;ure. Another Sunday night her father told Hes|ter, he thought &s;he had been at &s;chool long enough for him to have a little good of her learning, &s;o he de&s;ired &s;he would &s;tay at home and read to him. He&s;ter cheer|fully ran and fetched her Te&s;tament, but John fell a laughing, called her a fool, and &s;aid, "it would be time enough to read the Te&s;tament to him when he was go|ing to die, but at pre&s;ent he mu&s;t have &s;omething mer|ry." So &s;aying, he gave her a &s;ong-book which he had picked up at the B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ll. He&s;ter having ca&s;t her eyes over it, refu&s;ed to read it, &s;aying, "&s;he did not dare offend God by reading what would hurt her own &s;oul." John called her a canting hypocrite, and &s;aid, he would put the Te&s;tament in the &s;ire, for that there was not a more merry girl than the was before &s;he became religious.&mdash; Her mother, for once, took her part, not becau&s;e &s;he thought by her daughter in the right, but becau&s;e &s;he was
<PB N="200" REF="035296_0294_1001C16BD40411B8">glad of any pretence to &s;hew her hu&s;band was in the wrong; though &s;he her&s;elf would have abu&s;ed He&s;ter for the &s;ame thing if John had taken her part. John, with a &s;hocking oath, abu&s;ed them both, and went off in a violent pa&s;&s;ion. He&s;ter, in&s;tead of &s;aying one undu|tiful word again&s;t her father, took up a p&s;alter in order to teach her little &s;i&s;ters, but Rebecca was &s;o provoked at her for not joining her in her abu&s;e of her hu&s;band, that &s;he changed her humor, &s;aid John was in the right, and He&s;ter a perver&s;e hypocrite, who only made reli|gion a pretence for being undutiful to her parents.&mdash;He&s;ter bore all in &s;ilence, and committed her cau&s;e to 02 him who judgeth righteou&s;ly. It would have been a great comfort to her if &s;he had dared to go and open her heart to Mrs. Crew, and to have joined in the reli|gious exerci&s;es of the evening at &s;chool. But her mo|ther refu&s;ed to let her, &s;aying, it would only harden her heart in mi&s;chief. He&s;ter &s;aid not a word, but after having put the little ones to bed, and heard them &s;ay their prayers out of &s;ight, &s;he went and &s;at down in her own little lo&s;t, and &s;aid to her&s;elf, "it would be plea&s;ant to me to have taught my little &s;i&s;ters to read, I thought it was my duty, for David has &s;aid, <HI>Come yo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> children, hearken unto me, I will teach you the fear of the Lord.</HI> It would have been &s;till more plea&s;ant to have pa&s;&s;ed the evening at &s;chool, becau&s;e I am &s;till ig|norant, and fitter to learn than to teach; but I cannot do either without flying in the face of my mother; God fees fit to-night to change my plea&s;ant duties into a pain|ful trial. I give up my will, and I &s;ubmit to the will of my father; but when he orders me to commit a known &s;in then I dare not do it, becau&s;e, in &s;o doing, I mu&s;t di&s;obly my Father which is in heaven." Now it &s;o fell out that this di&s;pute happened on the very Sun|day next before Mrs. Jones's yearly fea&s;t. On May|day all the &s;chool attended her to church, each in a &s;tuff gow of their own earning, and a cap and white apron
<PB N="201" REF="035296_0295_1001C16F59949580">of her giving. After church there was an examination made into the learning and behaviour of the &s;chools; tho&s;e who were mo&s;t perfect in their chapters, and brought the be&s;t character for indu&s;try, humility, and &s;obriety, received a bible, or &s;ome other good book.</P>
<P>Now He&s;ter had been a whole year hoarding up her little &s;avings in order to be ready with a new gown on the May-day fea&s;t. She had never got le&s;s than two &s;hillings a week by her &s;pinning, be&s;ides working for the family, and earning a trifle by odd jobs. This mo|ney &s;he faithfully carried to her mother every Saturday night, keeping back, by con&s;ent, only two pence a week towards the gown. The &s;um was compleat, the pattern had long been &s;ettled, and He&s;ter had only on the Monday morning to go to the &s;hop, pay her money, and bring home her gown to be made. Her mother happened to go out that morning early to iron-in a gentleman's family, where &s;he u&s;ually &s;tayed a day or two, and He&s;ter was bu&s;y putting the hou&s;e in order before &s;he went to the &s;hop.</P>
<P>On that very Monday there was to be a meeting at the Bell of all the idle fellows in the pari&s;h. John Wil|mot of cour&s;e was to be there. Indeed he had accepted a challenge of the black&s;mith to a batch at all-fours.&mdash;The black&s;mith was flu&s;h of money, John thought him&s;elf the be&s;t player; and that he might make &s;ure of winning, he re&s;olved to keep him&s;elf &s;ober, which he knew was more than the other would do. John was &s;o u&s;ed to go upon tick for ale, that he got to the door of the Bell before he recollected that he could not keep his word with the gambler without money, and he had not a penny in his pocket, &s;o he &s;ullenly turned home|wards. He dared not apply to his wife, as he knew he &s;hould be more likely to get a &s;cratched &s;ace than a &s;ix|pence from her; but he knew that He&s;ter had receiv|ed two &s;hillings for her la&s;t week's &s;pinning on Satur|day, and perhaps &s;he might not yet have given it to her
<PB N="202" REF="035296_0296_1001C177304E8420">mother. Of the hoarded &s;um he knew nothing. He a&s;ked her if &s;he could lend him half a crown and he would pay her next day. He&s;ter plea&s;ed to &s;ee him in good humor after what had pa&s;&s;ed the night before, ran up and fetched down her little box, and, in the joy of her heart that he now de&s;ired &s;omething &s;he could com|ply with without wounding her con&s;cience, cheerfully poured out her whole little &s;tock upon the table. John was in raptures at the &s;ight of three half-crowns and a &s;ix-pence, eagerly &s;eized it, box and all, together with a &s;ew hoarded halfpence at the bottom, though he had only a&s;ked to borrow half a crown. None but one who&s;e heart was hardened by a long cour&s;e of drunkenne&s;s could have taken away the whole, and for &s;uch a purpo&s;e. He told her &s;he &s;hould certainly have it again next morning, and indeed intended to pay it, not doubting but he &s;hould double the &s;um. But John over-rated his own &s;kill or luck, for he lo&s;t every farthing to the black&s;mith, and &s;neaked home before midnight, and quietly walked up to-bed. He was quite &s;ober, which He&s;ter thought a good &s;ign. Next morning &s;he a&s;ked him in a very humble way for the money, which &s;he &s;aid &s;he would not have done, but that if the gown was not bought directly, it would not be ready in time for the fea&s;t. John's con&s;cience had troubled him a little for what he had done, for when he was not drunk he was not ill-natured, and he &s;tammered out a broken ex|cu&s;e, but owned he had lo&s;t the money, and had not a farthing left. The moment He&s;ter &s;aw him mild and kind, her heart was &s;o&s;tened, and &s;he begged him not to vex; adding that &s;he would be contented never to have a new gown as long as &s;he lived, if &s;he could have the comfort of always &s;eeing him come home as &s;ober as he was la&s;t night. For He&s;ter did not know that he had refrained from getting drunk, only that he might gamble with a better chance of &s;ucce&s;s, and that when a game&s;ter keeps him&s;elf &s;ober, it is not that he may
<PB N="203" REF="035296_0297_1001C17CF58BFA30">practi&s;e a virtue, but that he may commit a wor&s;e crime. "I am indeed &s;orry for what I have done," &s;aid he, "you cannot go to the fea&s;t, and what will Madam Jones &s;ay?" "Yes, but I can," &s;aid He&s;ter, "for God looks not at the gown, but at the heart, and I am &s;ure he &s;ees mine full of gratitude at hearing you talk &s;o kindly; and if I thought my dear father would change his pre&s;ent evil cour&s;es, I &s;hould be the happi|e&s;t girl at the fea&s;t to-morrow." John walked away mournfully, and &s;aid to him&s;elf, "&s;urely there mu&s;t be &s;omething in religion &s;ince it can thus change the heart. He&s;ter was a pert girl, and now &s;he is as mild as a lamb. She was an indolent girl, and now &s;he is up with the lark. She was a vain girl, and would do any thing for a new ribbon; and now &s;he is contented to go in rags to a fea&s;t at which every one el&s;e will have a new gown. She deprived her&s;elf of the gown to give me the mo|ney, and yet this very girl, &s;o dutiful in &s;ome things, would &s;ubmit to be turned out of doors, rather than read a loo&s;e book at my command, or break the Sab|bath. I do not under&s;tand this, there mu&s;t be &s;ome my&s;tery in it." All this he &s;aid as he was going to work. In the evening he did not go to the Bell, whe|ther it was owing to his new thoughts or to his not having a penny in his pocket, I will not take upon me po&s;itively to &s;ay, but I believe it was a little of one, and a little of the other.</P>
<P>As the pattern of the intended gown had long been &s;ettled in the family, and as He&s;ter had the money by her, it was looked on as good as bought, &s;o that &s;he was tru&s;ted to get it brought home and made in her mother's ab&s;ence. Indeed, &s;o little did Rebecca care about the &s;chool, that &s;he would not have cared any thing about the gown, if her vanity had not made her wi&s;h that her daughter &s;hould be the be&s;t dre&s;t of any girl at the fea&s;t. Being from home as was &s;aid before, &s;he knew nothing of the di&s;appointment. On May|day
<PB N="204" REF="035296_0298_1001C18D0EB3EA80">morning, He&s;ter, in&s;tead of keeping from the fea&s;t becau&s;e &s;he had not a new gown, or meanly inventing any excu&s;e, dre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf out as neatly as &s;he could in her poor old things, and went to join the &s;chool in or|der to go to church. Whether He&s;ter had formerly in|dulged a little pride of heart, and talked of this gown rather too much, I am not quite &s;ure, certain it is, there was a great hue and cry made at &s;eeing He&s;ter Wilmot, the neate&s;t girl, the mo&s;t indu&s;trious girl in the &s;chool, come to the May-day fea&s;t in an old &s;tuff gown, when every other girl was &s;o creditably dre&s;&s;. Indeed, I am &s;orry to &s;ay, there were two or three much too &s;mart for their &s;tation, and who had dizened them&s;elves out in very improper finery, which Mrs. Jones made them take eff before her. "I mean this fea&s;t," &s;aid &s;he, "as a re|ward of indu&s;try and piety, and not as a trial of &s;kill who can be fine&s;t, and outvie the re&s;t in &s;how. If I do not take care my fea&s;t will become an encouragement, not to virtue, but to vanity. I am &s;o great a friend to decency of apparel, that I even like to &s;ee you deny your appetites that you may be able to come decently dre&s;&s;er to the hou&s;e of God. To encourage you to do this, I like to &s;et apart this one day of innocent plea&s;ure again&s;t which you may be preparing all the year, by laying a|&s;ide &s;omething every week towards buying a gown out of your little &s;avings. But let me tell you, that meek|ne&s;s and an humble &s;pirit is of more value in the &s;ight of God and good men than the gaye&s;t cotton gown, or the brighte&s;t pink ribbon in the pari&s;h."</P>
<P>Mrs. Jones, for all this, was as much &s;urpri&s;ed as the re&s;t at He&s;ter's mean garb: but &s;uch is the power of a good character that &s;he gave her credit for a right in|tention, e&s;pecially as &s;he knew the unhappy &s;tate of her family. For it was Mrs. Jones's way (and it is not a bad way) always to wait, and enquire into the truth, before &s;he condemned any body of good character, tho' appearances were again&s;t them. "As we cannot judge
<PB N="205" REF="035296_0299_1001C19059303E00">of people's motives," &s;aid &s;he, "we may, from igno|rance, condemn their be&s;t actions, and approve of their wor&s;t." It will be always time enough to judge unfa|vorably, and let us give others credit as long as we can and then we in our turn may expect a favorable judg|ment from others." He&s;ter was no more proud of what &s;he had done for her father, than &s;he was humbled by the meanne&s;s of her garb, and though Betty Stiles, one of the girls, who&s;e finery had been taken away, &s;neered at her, He&s;ter never offered to clear her&s;elf by expo&s;ing her father, though &s;he thought it right &s;ecretly to inform Mrs. Jones of what had pa&s;t. When the examination of the girls began, Betty Stiles was a&s;ked &s;ome ques|tions on the fourth and fifth commandments, which &s;he an&s;wered very well. He&s;ter was a&s;ked nearly the &s;ame que&s;tions, and though &s;he an&s;wered them no better than Betty had done, they were all &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee Mrs. Jones ri&s;e up and give a hand&s;ome bible to He&s;ter, while &s;he gave nothing to Betty. This girl cried out rather pertly, "Madam, it is very hard that I have no book, I was as perfect as He&s;ter." "I have often told you," &s;aid Mrs. Jones, "that religion is not a thing of the tongue b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> of the heart. That girl gives me the be&s;t proof that &s;he has learned the fourth commandment to good purpo&s;e, who per&s;i&s;ts in keeping holy the &s;abbath day, though commanded to break it by a parent whom &s;he loves. And that girl be&s;t proves that &s;he keeps the fifth, who gives up her own comfort and cloathing, and credit, to honor and obey her father and mother, even though they are not &s;uch as &s;he could wi&s;h. Bet|ty Stiles, though &s;he could an&s;wer the que&s;tions &s;o rea|dily, went a nutting la&s;t Sunday when &s;he &s;hould have been at &s;chool, and refu&s;ed to nur&s;e her &s;ick mother when &s;he could not help her&s;elf."</P>
<P>Farmer Ho&s;kins, who &s;tood by, whi&s;pered to Mrs. Jones, "Well, Madam, now you have convinced even one of the benefit of religious in&s;truction, now I &s;ce
<PB N="206" REF="035296_0300_1001C195F1D35730">there is a meaning to it. I thought it was in at one ear and out at the other, and that a &s;ong was as well as a p&s;alm; but now I have found that the proof of the pudding is in the eating.

<P>The plea&s;ure He&s;ter felt in receiving a new bible, made her forget that &s;he had on an old gown. She walked to church in a thankful frame; but how great was her joy, when &s;he &s;aw, among a number of work|ing men, her own father going into church. As &s;he pa&s;t by him &s;he ca&s;t on him a look of &s;o much joy and affection, that it brought tears into his eyes, e&s;pecially when he compared her mean dre&s;s with that of the o|ther girls, and thought who had been the cau&s;e of it.&mdash;John, who had not been at church for &s;ome years, was deeply &s;truck with the &s;ervice. The confe&s;&s;ion with which it opens went to his heart. He felt, for the fir&s;t time, that he was <HI>a mi&s;erable &s;inner, and that there was no health in him.</HI> He now felt compunction for &s;in in general, though it was only his ill beh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">vi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">r to his daughter which had brought him to church. The &s;er|mon was &s;uch as &s;erved to &s;trengthen the impre&s;&s;ion which the prayers had made, and when it was over, in&s;tead of joining the ringers (for the belfry was the only part of the church John liked, becau&s;e it u&s;ually led to the ale-hou&s;e) he quietly walked back to his work. It was indeed the be&s;t day's work he ever made. He could not get out of his head the whole day the fir&s;t words he had heard at church. <HI>When the wicked man turneth away from his wickedne&s;s, and doth that which is lawful and right, he &s;hall &s;ave his &s;oul alive.</HI> At night, in&s;tead of going to the Bell, he went home, in|tending to a&s;k He&s;ter to forgive him; but as &s;oon as he got to the door, he heard Rebecca rating his daugh|ter
<PB N="207" REF="035296_0301_1001C19AC63B4A88">for having brought &s;uch a di&s;grace on the family as to be &s;een in that old rag of a gown, and in&s;i&s;ted on knowing what &s;he had done with the money. He&s;ter tried to keep the &s;ecret, but her mother declared &s;he w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">uld turn her out of doors if &s;he did not tell the truth. He&s;ter was at la&s;t forced to confe&s;s &s;he had given it to her father. Unfortunately for poor John, it was at this very moment he opened the door. The mother now di|vided her fury between her guilty hu&s;band and her in|nocent child, till from words &s;he fell to blows. John defended his daughter, and received &s;ome of the &s;trokes intended for the poor girl. This turbulent &s;cene part|ly put John's good re&s;olutions to flight, though the pa|tience of He&s;ter did him almo&s;t as much good as the &s;ermon he had heard. At length the poor girl e&s;caped up &s;tairs, not a litte brui&s;ed, and a &s;cene of much vio|lence pa&s;&s;ed between John and Rebecca. She declared &s;he would not &s;it down to &s;upper with &s;uch a brute, and &s;et off to a neighbor's hou&s;e, that &s;he might have the plea&s;ure of abuting him the longer. John, who&s;e mind was much di&s;turbed, went up &s;tairs without his &s;upper. As he was pa&s;&s;ing by He&s;ter's little room he heard her voice, and as he concluded &s;he was venting bitter complaints again&s;t her unnatural parents, he &s;top|ped to li&s;ten, re&s;olving to go in and comfort her. He &s;topped at the door, for by the light of the moon he &s;aw her kneeling by her bed&s;ide, and praying &s;o earne&s;tly that &s;he did not hear him. As he made &s;ure &s;he could be praying for nothing but his death, what was his &s;ur|pri&s;e to hear the&s;e words, "O Lord, have mercy upon my dear father and mother, teach me to love them, to pray for them, and do them good, make me more du|tiful, and more patient, that, adorning the doctrine of God, my Saviour, I may recommend his holy religion, and my dear parents may be brought to love and fear thee."</P>
<P>Poor John, who would never have been hard hearted
<PB N="208" REF="035296_0302_1001C1A025A3C5D0">if he had not been a drunkard, could not &s;tand this, he fell down on his knees, embraced his child, and beg|ged her to teach him how to pray. He prayed him&s;elf as well as he could, and though he did not know what words to u&s;e, yet his heart was melted; he owned he was a &s;inner, and begged He&s;ter to fetch the prayer-book, and read over the confe&s;&s;ion with which he had been &s;o much &s;truck at church. This was the plea&s;ant|e&s;t order &s;he had ever obeyed. Seeing him deeply af|fected with a &s;en&s;e of &s;in, &s;he pointed out to him the Saviour of &s;inners; and in this manner &s;he pa&s;t &s;ome hours with her father, which were the happie&s;t of her life; &s;uch a night was worth a hundred cotton, or even &s;ilk gowns. In the cour&s;e of the week He&s;ter read o|ver the confe&s;&s;ion, and &s;ome other prayers to her fa|ther &s;o often that he got them by heart, and repeated them while he was at work. And at length he took courage to kneel down and pray before he went to-bed From that time he bore his wife's ill-humor much bet|ter than he had ever done, and, as he knew her to be neat and notable, and &s;aving, he began to think, that if her temper was not quite &s;o bad, his home might &s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">l become as plea&s;ant a place to him as ever the Bell had been; but unle&s;s &s;he became more tractable h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e did not know what to do with his long evenings after the little ones were in bed, for he began once more to delight in playing with them. He&s;ter propo&s;ed that &s;he &s;hould teach him to read an hour every night, and he con&s;ent|ed. Rebecca began to &s;torm from the mere trick &s;he had got of &s;torming; but finding that he now brought home all his earnings, and that &s;he got both his mo|ney and his company (for &s;he had once loved him) &s;he began to reconcile her&s;elf to this new way of life. In a few months John could read a p&s;alm; in learning to read it he al&s;o got it by heart, and this proved a little &s;tore for private devotion, and while he was mowing be could call to mind a text to cheer his labor. Henow
<PB N="209" REF="035296_0303_1001C1A5948B5E70">went con&s;tantly to church, and often dropped in at the &s;chool on a Sunday evening to hear their prayers. He expre&s;&s;ed &s;o much plea&s;ure at this, that one day He&s;ter ventured to a&s;k him if they &s;hould &s;et up family prayer at home. John &s;aid he &s;hould like it mightily, but as he could not yet read quite well enough, he de&s;ired Hes|ter to try to get a proper book, and begin next Sunday night. He&s;ter had bought of a pious hawker for three half-pence the book of prayers, printed for the cheap Repo&s;itory, by Mr. Mar&s;hall, Queer-&s;treet, Cheap-&s;ide.</P>
<P>When He&s;ter read the exhortation at the beginning of this little book, her mother who &s;at in the corner; and pretended to be a&s;leep, was &s;o much &s;truck that &s;he could not find a word to &s;ay again&s;t it. For a few nights indeed, &s;he continued to &s;it &s;till, or pretended to rock the young child while her hu&s;band and daughter were kneeling at their prayers. She expected John would have &s;colded her for this, and &s;o perver&s;e was her tem|per, that &s;he was di&s;appointed at his finding no fault with her. Seeing at la&s;t that he was very patient, and that though he prayed fervently him&s;elf, he &s;uffered her to do as &s;he liked, &s;he loft the &s;pirit of oppo&s;ition for want of &s;omething to provoke it. As her pride be|gan to be &s;ubdued, &s;ome little di&s;po&s;ition to piety was awakened in her heart. By degrees &s;he &s;lid down on her knees, though at fir&s;t it was behind the cradle or the clock, or in &s;ome corner where &s;he thought they would not &s;ee her. He&s;ter rejoiced even in this out|ward change in her mother, and prayed that God would at la&s;t be plea&s;ed to touch her heart as he had done that of her father.</P>
<P>As John now &s;pent no idle money, he had &s;aved up a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">trifle by working over-hours, this he kindly offered to He&s;ter to make up for the lo&s;s of her gown. In&s;tead of accepting it, He&s;ter told him, that as &s;he her&s;elf was young and healthy, &s;he &s;hould &s;oon be able to clothe
<PB N="210" REF="035296_0304_1001C1AD51F25088">her&s;elf out of her own &s;avings, and begged him to make her mother a pre&s;ent of this gown, which he did. It had been a maxim of Rebecca, that it was better not to go to church at all tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> go in an old gown. She had, however, &s;o far conquered this evil notion, that &s;he had lately gone pretty often. This kindne&s;s of the gown touched her not a little, and the fir&s;t Sunday &s;he put it on, Mr. Simp&s;on happened to preach from this text, <HI>God re&s;i&s;teth the proud, but giveth grace to the humble.</HI> This &s;ermon &s;o affected Rebecca that &s;he ne|ver once thought &s;he had her new gown on, till &s;he came to take it off when &s;he went to-bed, and that ve|ry night, in&s;tead of &s;kulking behind, &s;he knelt down by her hu&s;band.</P>
<P>There was one thing &s;unk deep in Rebecca's mind, &s;he had ob&s;erved that &s;ince her hu&s;band had grown re|ligious he had been &s;o careful not to give her any of|fence, that he was become &s;crupulou&s;ly clean; took off his dirty &s;hoes before he &s;at down, and was very cautious not to &s;pill a drop of beer on her &s;hining table. Now it was rather remarkable, that as John grew more neat, Rebecca grew more indifferent to neatne&s;s. But both the&s;e changes aro&s;e from the &s;ame cau&s;e, the growth of religion in their hearts. John grew cleanly from the fear of giving pain to his wife, while Rebecca grew indifferent from having di&s;covered the &s;in and va|nity of an over anxious care about tri&s;t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s.</P>
<P>He&s;ter continues to grow in grace and in knowledge. La&s;t chri&s;tmas-day &s;he was appointed an under teacher in the &s;chool, and many people think that &s;ome years hence, if any thing &s;hould happen to Mrs. Crew, Hes|ter may be promoted to be head mi&s;tre&s;s.</P>

<HEAD>ON THE SACRAMENT OF THE LORD's SUPPER.</HEAD>
<P>HOW comes it that &s;o many per&s;ons who go re|gularly to public wor&s;hip, neverthele&s;s do not attend at the Sacrament? Are they right or wrong in turning their backs on this &s;olemn ordinance? It is a que&s;tion well worth con&s;idering, and it is the intention of this tract to clear up, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, this impor|tant &s;ubject.</P>
<P>I believe the principal rea&s;on which many people have to give for not receiving the Sacrament is, that they are afraid of it. "I think it an awful thing," &s;ay they, "to receive the Sacrament. I am fearful le&s;t I &s;hould eat and drink my own damnation." To &s;uch per&s;ons we reply, have you ever enquired into the real meaning and nature of what you &s;o much dread? Read the pre&s;ent tract. Learn to under &s;tand what the acra|ment of the Lord's Supper is, and when you know, then decide whether you will receive it or not. Let me here remark al&s;o, that the phra&s;e of <HI>eating and drinking our own damnation</HI> is a phra&s;e extremely mi&s;under&s;tood. It is borrowed from the Apo&s;tle Paul, but when the Apo&s;tle u&s;ed it he applied it to certain Corinthians who got drunk at the Sacrament; and it is material al&s;o to ob&s;erve, that by the word "damnation" the Apo&s;tle meant "condemnation," and you will find, if you will read the pa&s;&s;age that he alluded chiefly to certain judg|ments in this world which the Corinthians brought upon them, &s;o that even in their ca&s;e he did not mean
<PB N="212" REF="035296_0306_1001C1B8B9773A38">to declare, that there would be no room for repentance in this world, and no &s;alvation in the next. It mu&s;t be owned in like manner, or rather it ought to be &s;olemn|ly in&s;i&s;ted on, that every one who now communicates unworthily, encrea&s;es his guilt rather than promotes his &s;alvation; but &s;till be does not &s;in pa&s;t all po&s;&s;ibility of forgivene&s;s; and let it be remembered, that a man may &s;in not only by communicating unworthily, but al&s;o by refu&s;ing to communicate.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>On the manner in which Chri&s;t appointed the Sacra|ment of the Lord's Supper.</HEAD>
<P>The be&s;t means of knowing what is the true nature of the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper, is to enquire into all that pa&s;&s;ed when our Saviour appointed it.&mdash;We read, with little difference of terms, in &s;everal of the Evangeli&s;ts, that our Saviour, <HI>on the &s;ame night on which he was betrayed, being at &s;upper with his dis|ciple<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, took bread and gave thanks, and brake it and gave unto them, &s;aying, this is my body which is giv|en for you. This do in remembrance of me. Likewi&s;e al&s;o, the cup after &s;upper, &s;aying, this cup is the New Te&s;tament in my blood which is &s;hed for you.</HI> The A|po&s;tle Paul further ob&s;erves, <HI>For as often as ye eat this bread and drink this cup, ye do &s;hew the Lord's death till be come.</HI> From this &s;hort and &s;imple account, which is nearly all that Scripture &s;ays on the &s;ubject, we are to collect what was our Saviour's intention in ap|pointing this Sacrament.</P>
<P>Now I think we are to under&s;tand, that he thereby meant to command all chri&s;tians to meet together, from time to time, and to partake of bread and wine, in or|der to keep up among them the remembrance of this his la&s;t &s;upper with his di&s;ciples, and of the &s;ufferings and death of Chri&s;t, which immediately followed. <HI>Take eat,</HI> &s;aid he, after having broken the bread, <HI>this is my body.</HI> That is, this broken bread is to remind you of my
<PB N="213" REF="035296_0307_1001C1BBE231C4D8">body broken for your &s;ake. And &s;peaking of the cup, he &s;aid, <HI>Drink ye all of this, for this is my blood of the New Te&s;tament which is &s;hed for many for the remis|&s;ion of &s;ins.</HI> That is, this cup is to remind you of my blood being &s;hed for the pardon (or remi&s;&s;ion) of &s;ins. <HI>Do this in remembrance of me.</HI> The&s;e la&s;t mentioned words may be under&s;tood both as an entreaty and as a command. Chri&s;t, your Saviour, entreats you thus to remember him. Chri&s;t, al&s;o, who is your Judge and Lord, commands you to do it. The command is as plain as any other command of Scripture, and he who di&s;obeys one command of Chri&s;t, may, with much the &s;ame rea&s;on, di&s;obey every other. It is, in &s;hort, as if our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour had &s;aid, "I am now about to die for your &s;ins, and to ri&s;e again for your ju&s;tification, and I make it my la&s;t and dying reque&s;t that you, and all my di&s;ciples will accu&s;tom your&s;elves to meet toge|ther, and to partake of bread and wine, as we have now done, in token of your bearing in mind, my pain|ful and bloody death, and in token al&s;o of your believ|ing that I, who am now about to be crucified, &s;hall hereafter come again, according to my promi&s;e, in pow|er and great glory." <HI>For as often as ye eat this bread and drink this cup, ye do &s;hew the Lord's death till he come.</HI></P>

<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>What it is to receive the Sacrament unworthily.</HEAD>
<P>Fir&s;t then, I think it is plain that to receive it igno|rantly, is to receive it unworthily. This may very pro|perly be called <HI>not di&s;cerning the Lord's body.</HI> Gro&s;s ignorance or error concerning the nature of the Sacra|ment, evidently &s;hews a man to be unfit at pre&s;ent to receive it, and gro&s;s ignorance of the doctrines of chri&s;tianity is in like manner a di&s;qualification. This ignorance, however, is that which &s;hould immediately be cured. Every per&s;on who is come to years of di&s;cre|tion &s;hould be afraid of remaining a &s;tranger to the
<PB N="214" REF="035296_0308_1001A3A02CB5FBE0">Lord's table. He &s;hould lo&s;e no time in enquiring into the nature of it, and when he under&s;tands it, he is no more to be excu&s;ed for ab&s;enting him&s;elf from it, than he is for ab&s;enting him&s;elf from the common public wor&s;hip.</P>
<P>But next I would ob&s;erve, that to receive the Sacra|ment in any re&s;pect, lightly and carele&s;sly, is to receive it unworthily. Some receive the Sacrament as a thing of cour&s;e as &s;oon as ever they arrive at a certain age; and at this &s;ame age perhaps they go and plunge them|&s;elves into all the vanities and follies of the world, if not into its vices al&s;o. Some receive it becau&s;e they have a grave character to &s;upport; &s;ome becau&s;e they are expected to receive it, and are a&s;hamed to refu&s;e to do &s;o, having, for in&s;tance, a brother or a &s;i&s;ter who receives it from whom they do not care to differ; &s;ome from mere zeal for their own church, of which they &s;hew them&s;elves &s;teady members by receiving the Sa|crament according to the forms which it has appoint|ed: &s;ome from a confu&s;ed mixture of &s;everal of the a|bovementioned motives; and &s;ome for the mere pur|po&s;e of qualifying them&s;elves for a place under govern|ment. Thus, while many &s;eriou&s;ly di&s;po&s;ed per&s;ons need to be encouraged to come to the Lord's table much more than is their cu&s;tom, it is to be feared al&s;o, that there are not a few of our communicants who in one way or other receive the Sacrament very unworthily.</P>
<P>Again, to receive the Lord's Supper &s;uper&s;titiou&s;ly is to receive it in &s;ome mea&s;ure unworthily. Now a man receive it &s;uper&s;titiou&s;ly who thinks there is &s;ome charm or unaccountable virtue in it, and who is not content with believing the Sacrament to be a means of grace, in the &s;ame manner as prayer or the reading of the Scriptures, or attendance on public wor&s;hip. The papi&s;ts go &s;o far as to adore the elements of bread and wine, which they al&s;o fancy that the prie&s;t is able, by con&s;ecration, to turn into the real and literal body and
<PB N="215" REF="035296_0309_1001C1C514419BA0">blood of Chri&s;t; and there are &s;ome Prote&s;tants who have not entirely e&s;caped from the &s;ame error; for they fancy that there is &s;ome dark and my&s;tical meaning in the Sacrament, which, however, they cannot explain; and they are not aware that it is that plain and &s;imple thing which we have de&s;cribed it to be. I am &s;orry to add that &s;ome &s;uper&s;titious prote&s;tants imitate the pa|pi&s;ts in another re&s;pect. They think they have done a very meritorious deed when they have received the Sa|crament; they have gone through what they call their religious duty, and in con&s;ideration of this they fancy that they have now obtained a right to employ them|&s;elves in any manner they think &s;it, and away therefore they go from the Lord's table into the world with minds full of ambition or pride, or covetou&s;ne&s;s, and the very Sacrament which they have attended &s;erves to confirm them in the neglect of daily and habitual repentance, and to give a dangerous and fal&s;e peace to their con&s;ciences, There are per&s;ons of this de&s;cription who prepare them|&s;elves po&s;&s;ibly with much &s;olemnity for the day of re|ceiving the Sacrament, and who even attend the &s;er|vice with a face of great &s;anctity and &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s. It mu&s;t, neverthele&s;s, be laid down as a maxim, that whenever any one's life is quite at variance with every thing he profe&s;&s;es at the Lord's table, that per&s;on mu&s;t be con&s;idered as a mere hypocrite and &s;elf-deceiver, and as one of the wor&s;t and mo&s;t unworthy &s;ort of commu|nicants.</P>

<HEAD>On the &s;elf-examination that is proper before we deter|mine to receive the Sacrament.</HEAD>
<P>St. Paul, after reproving the Corinthians for their profanation of the Lord's Supper, ob&s;erves, <HI>but let a man examine him&s;elf, and &s;o let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup.</HI> In the catechi&s;m of the church of England we are in&s;tructed, what it is that may now be particularly required of communicants; namely,
<PB N="216" REF="035296_0310_1001C1CA5FA82810">"that they &s;hould examine them&s;elves whether they re|pent them truly of their former &s;ins, &s;tedfa&s;tly purpos|ing to lead a new life; whether they have a lively faith in God's mere, through Chri&s;t, with a thankful re|membrance of his death, and whether they are in chari|ty with all men!" Let every one then examine him|&s;elf on the&s;e &s;ever I heads, and more e&s;pecially when he is for the fir&s;t time about to communicate. Here, how|ever, while we warn the carele&s;s not to be too &s;light in their &s;elf-examination, let us al&s;o caution the &s;erious not to be too &s;evere.

<HEAD>On the di&s;po&s;itions which we &s;hould feel at the time of communicating.</HEAD>
<P>The Lord's Supper was ordained "for a continual remembrance of the &s;acrifice and death of Chri&s;t, and of the benefits which we receive thereby." The bene|fits which we receive from the death of Chri&s;t, are therefore one of the chief &s;ubjects on which we &s;hould reflect when we are approaching the table of the Lord
<PB N="217" REF="035296_0311_1001C1CC19A68B28">We &s;hould con&s;ider that we are now about to comme|morate the death of that Savior who died for us, <HI>the ju&s;t for the unju&s;t, that he might bring us to God: who was wounded for our tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, and brui&s;ed for our iniquities, and the cha&s;ti&s;ement of our peace was upon him, and by his &s;tripes we are healed.

Humility, meekne&s;s, patience to|wards others, loving kindne&s;s and charity, a di&s;po&s;ition to forgive injuries and to take reproofs without anger, contentment with our lot, and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion under the af|flicting hand of Providence, all the&s;e are tempers which cannot fail to ari&s;e out of an habitual &s;en&s;e of our un|worthine&s;s, and they are the tempers therefore which become a communicant; nor is there any doubt that every &s;incere communicant will find the&s;e tempers en|crea&s;e in him through his frequent attendance at the Lord's table.</P>
<P>Again, we are &s;uppo&s;ed by another part of the &s;er|vice mo&s;t humbly to declare, "We do mo&s;t earne&s;tly repent, and are heartily &s;orry for the&s;e our mi&s;doings. The remembrance of them is grievous unto us, the bur|thens of them is intolerable." But how fal&s;e and hypo|critical &s;hould we &s;u&s;pect our&s;elves to have been in the&s;e words, if we &s;eldom afterwards feel any &s;orrow for our &s;ins, if we neglect the duty of habitual repentance, and if we pretend that Chri&s;t with &s;ave us, or that the mere Sacrament will &s;ave us, without our feeling in our hearts any great hatred of iniquity. Let us therefore never think after we have pronounced tho&s;e words, that &s;in can be counted too great an evil, that temptations to &s;in can be too much avoided, that repentance can ev|er be too deep or &s;erious, or that things in this re&s;pect can, as the world imagine, be ever carried too far.</P>
<P><PB N="219" REF="035296_0313_1001C1D59092C858">
Once more&mdash;we are &s;uppo&s;ed at the end of the &s;er|vice each of us to declare, "and here we offer and pre|&s;ent unto thee our&s;elves, and &s;ouls and bodies, to be a rea&s;onable, holy, and lively &s;acrifice unto thee." Do we then indeed and in truth thus devote our&s;elves to God? To have &s;aid the&s;e words, and to have repeated them again and again at the Sacrament, is to have done little. By the&s;e words it is meant, not only that a &s;o|lemn &s;ervice &s;hould be performed, and that a moment|ary feeling &s;hould be expre&s;&s;ed, but it is intended al&s;o to imply that we purpo&s;e actually to employ all our pow|ers and faculties, whether of body or of &s;oul, our time, our wealth, our abilities, and our influence in the cau&s;e of our Maker and our Redeemer; for <HI>we are not our own, but are bought with a price;</HI> a life really laid out in the &s;ervice of God is therefore to be expected in a com|municant. To redeem each precious moment of our time by employing it in whatever is our mo&s;t proper and mo&s;t urgent work, to &s;hake off our natural indo|lence and &s;loth, and to go from the Lord's table into &s;cenes of diligence and u&s;efulne&s;s: thus to join together the love of God and of man, and to be active as well as to be devout, is to be con&s;i&s;tent in our character as chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>If then we have attended at the table of the Lord, <HI>let us not forget to do good, and to di&s;tribute;</HI> for the&s;e al|&s;o are <HI>&s;acrifices with which God is well plea&s;ed.</HI> Let us not only pour out our hearts in prayer, but let us al|&s;o employ our active powers in the Lord's &s;ervice. <HI>Let us be &s;tedfa&s;t, immoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord.</HI> Let us <HI>keep under our body, and bring it into &s;ubjection.</HI> Let us command our pa&s;&s;ions, and re&s;train our tongues. Let us al&s;o be punctual in our engagements, upright, exemplary Let us be <HI>zeal|ou&s;ly affected in every good cau&s;e;</HI> and while we <HI>vi&s;it the fatherle&s;s and widows in their affliction,</HI> let us take equal care that <HI>we keep our &s;elves un&s;potted from the world.</HI></P>

<HEAD>THE HISTORY OF MR. FANTOM, THE NEW FASHIONED PHILOSOPHER, AND HIS MAN WILLIAM.</HEAD>
<P>MR. FANTOM was a retail trader in the city of London. As he had no turn to any expen&s;ive vices, he was reckoned a &s;ober, decent man, but he was covetous and proud, &s;elfi&s;h and conceited. As &s;oon as he got forward in the world, his vanity began to dis|play it&s;elf, but not in the ordinary method of making a figure, and living away; but &s;till he was tormented with a longing de&s;ire to draw public notice, and to di&s;tin|gui&s;h him&s;elf. He felt a general &s;en&s;e of di&s;content at what he was, with a general ambition to be &s;omething which he was not; but this de&s;ire had not yet turned it|&s;elf to any particular object. It was not by his money he could hope to be di&s;tingui&s;hed, for half his acquaint|ance had more, and a man mu&s;t be rich indeed, to be noted for his riches in London. Mr. Fantom's mind was a prey to vain imaginations. He de&s;pi&s;ed all tho&s;e little acts of kindne&s;s and charity which every man is called to perform every day, and while he was contriv|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> grand &s;chemes which lay quite out of his reach, he
<PB N="221" REF="035296_0315_1001C1DC552690E8">neglected the ordinary duties of life which lay directly before him.</P>
<P>About this time he got hold of a famous little book written by the new philo&s;opher, who&s;e pe&s;tilent doc|trines found a ready entrance into Mr. Fantom's mind; a mind at once &s;hallow and inqui&s;itive, &s;peculative and vain, ambitious and di&s;&s;atisfied. As almo&s;t every book was new to him, he fell into the common error of tho&s;e who begin to read late in life, that of thinking that what he did not know him&s;elf was equally new to o|thers; and he was apt to fancy that he and the author he was reading were the only two people in the world who knew any thing. This book led to the grand di&s;covery; he had now found what his heart panted after, a way to <HI>di&s;tingui&s;h him&s;elf.</HI> To &s;tart out a full grown philo&s;o|pher at once, to be wi&s;e without education, to di&s;pute without learning, and to make pro&s;elytes without ar|gument, was a &s;hort cut to fame; which well &s;uited his vanity and his ignorance. He rejoiced that he had been &s;o clever as to examine for him&s;elf, pitied his friends who took things upon tru&s;t, and was re&s;olved to a&s;&s;ert the freedom of his own mind. To a man fond of bold novelties and daring paradoxes, &s;olid argument would be flat, and truth would be dull, merely becau&s;e it is not new. Mr. Fantom believed, not in propor|tion to the &s;trength of the evidence, but to the impu|dence of the a&s;&s;ertion. The trampling on holy ground with dirty &s;hoes, the &s;mearing the &s;anctuary with filth and mire, the calling prophets and apo&s;tles by the mo&s;t &s;currilous names, was new, and da&s;hing, and dazzling. Mr. Fantom now being &s;et free from the chains of &s;lavery and &s;uper&s;tition, was re&s;olved to &s;how his zeal in the u&s;ual way, by trying to free others, but it would have hurt his vanity had he known that he was the convert of a man who had written only for the vulgar, who had invented nothing, no, not even one idea of original wickedne&s;s; but who had &s;tooped to rake up
<PB N="222" REF="035296_0316_1001C1E273534070">out of the kennel of infidelity, all the loath&s;ome dregs and offal dirt, which politer unbelievers had thrown a|way as too gro&s;s and offen&s;ive for their better bred rea|ders.</P>
<P>Mr. Fantom, who con&s;idered that a philo&s;opher mu&s;t &s;et up with a little &s;ort of &s;tock in trade, now pick|ed up all the common place notions again&s;t chri&s;tianity, which have been an&s;wered a hundred times over: the&s;e he kept by him ready cut and dried, and brought ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> in all companies with a zeal which would have done honor to a better cau&s;e, but which the friends to a bet|ter cau&s;e are not &s;o apt to di&s;cover. He &s;oon got all the cant of the new &s;chool. He talked of narrowne&s;s, and ignorance, and bigotry, and prejudice, and prie&s;t ca&s;t, on the one hand; and on the other of public good, the love of mankind, and liberality, and candor, and tole|ration, and above all, benevolence. Benevolence, he &s;aid, made up the whole of religion, and all the other parts of it were nothing but cant, and jargon, and hy|pocri&s;y. Finding, however, that he made little im|pre&s;&s;ion on his old club at the Cat and Bagpipes, he grew tired of their company, yet there was one mem|ber who&s;e &s;ociety he could not re&s;olve to give up, tho' they &s;eldom agreed, as indeed no two men in the &s;ame cla&s;s and habits of life could le&s;s re&s;emble each other.&mdash; Mr. Trueman was an hone&s;t, plain, &s;imple hearted trade&s;man of the good old cut, who feared God and followed his bu&s;ine&s;s, he went to church twice on Sun|days, and minded his &s;hop all the week, &s;pent frugally, gave liberally, and &s;aved moderately.</P>
<P>Mr. Fantom re&s;olved to retire for a while into the country, and devote his time to his new plans, &s;chemes, theories, and projects for the public good. A life of talking, and reading, and writing, and di&s;puting, and teaching, and pro&s;elyting now &s;truck him as the only life, &s;o he &s;oon &s;et out for the country with his family, to which was now added his new footman, William
<PB N="223" REF="035296_0317_1001C1E7D4F79D60">Wil&s;on, whom he had taken with a good character out of a &s;ober family. He was no &s;ooner &s;ettled than he wrote to invite Mr. Trueman to come and pay him a vi&s;it, for he would have bur&s;t if he could not have got &s;ome one to whom he might di&s;play his new knowledge. He knew that if on the one hand, Trueman was no &s;cholar, yet on the other he was no fool, and though he de&s;pi&s;ed his prejudices, yet he thought he might be made a good decoy duck, for if he could once bring Trueman over, the whole club at the Cat and Bag|pipes might be brought to follow his example, and thus he might &s;ee him&s;elf at the head of a &s;ociety of his own pro&s;elytes, the &s;upreme object of a philo&s;opher's ambition. Trueman came accordingly. He &s;oon found that however he might be &s;hocked at the impious doc|trines his friend maintained, yet that an important les|&s;on might be learnt even from the wor&s;t enemies of truth; namely, an ever-wakeful attention to their grand object. If they &s;et out with talking of trade or poli|tics; of private news or public affairs, &s;till Mr. Fan|tom was ever on the watch to hitch in his darling doc|trines; whatever he began with, he was &s;ure to end with a pert &s;quib at the Bible, a vapid je&s;t on the cler|gy, the mi&s;eries of &s;uper&s;tition, and the ble&s;&s;ings of philo&s;ophy. "Oh!" &s;aid Trueman to him&s;elf, "when &s;hall I &s;ee chri&s;tians half &s;o much in earne&s;t? Why is it that almo&s;t all zeal is on the wrong &s;ide?"</P>
<P>"Well, Mr. Fantom," &s;aid Trueman next day at breakfea&s;t, "I am afraid you are leading but an idle &s;ort of life here." "Sir," &s;aid Fantom, "I now begin to live to &s;ome purpo&s;e; I have indeed lo&s;t too much time, and wa&s;ted my talents on a little retail trade, in which one is of no note; one can't di&s;tingui&s;h one's &s;elf." "So much the better," &s;aid Trueman, "I had rather not di&s;tingui&s;h my&s;elf, unle&s;s it was by leading a better life than my neighbors. There is nothing I &s;hould dread more than being talked about. I dare &s;ay now heaven is in a good mea&s;ure filled with people
<PB N="224" REF="035296_0318_1001C1EE7285F1D8">who&s;e names were never heard out of their own &s;treet or village. So I beg leave not to di&s;tingui&s;h my&s;elf." "Yes, but one may if it is only by &s;igning one's name to an e&s;&s;ay or a paragraph in a new&s;paper," &s;aid Fan|tom. "Heaven keep John Trueman's name out of a new&s;paper," interrupted he in a fright, "for it mu&s;t either be found in the Old Bailey or the Bankrupt Li&s;t, unle&s;s indeed, I were to remove &s;hop, or &s;ell off my old &s;tock." "But in your pre&s;ent confined &s;ituation you can be of no u&s;e," &s;aid Fantom. "That I deny," interrupted the other. "I have filled all the pari&s;h of|fices with &s;ome credit. I never took a bribe at an elec|tion, no, not &s;o much as a treat; I take care of my apprentices, and don't &s;et them a bad example by run|ning to plays and Sadler's Wells in the week, or jaun|ting about in a gig all day on Sundays; for I look up|on it that the country jaunt of the ma&s;ter on Sundays expo&s;es his &s;ervants to more danger than their whole week's temptations in trade put together."</P>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fantom.</SPEAKER>
<P>I once had the &s;ame vulgar prejudices about the church and the &s;abbath, and all that antiquated &s;tuff. But even on your own narrow principles, how can a thinking being &s;pend his Sunday better (if he mu&s;t lo&s;e one day in &s;even by having any Sunday at all) than by going into the country to admire the works of nature.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Trueman.</SPEAKER>
<P>I &s;uppo&s;e you mean the works of God; for I never read in the bible that nature made any thing. I &s;hould rather think that &s;he her&s;elf was made by him who made all things; by him, who, when he &s;aid, <HI>thou &s;halt not murder,</HI> &s;aid al&s;o, <HI>thou &s;halt keep holy the &s;ab|bath day.</HI> But now do you really think that all that multitude of coaches, chariots, chai&s;es, vis-a-vis, boo|by-hutches, &s;ulkies, &s;ociables, phaetons, gigs, curri|cles, cabrioles, chairs, &s;tages, plea&s;ure-carts and hor&s;es, which crowd our roads; all tho&s;e country hou&s;es with|in reach, to which the London friends pour in to the gorgeous Sunday fea&s;t, which the &s;ervants are kept
<PB N="225" REF="035296_0319_1001C1F55FB30D20">from church to dre&s;s; all tho&s;e public hou&s;es under the &s;igns of which you read the&s;e alluring words, AN OR|DINARY ON SUNDAYS; I &s;ay, do you believe that all tho&s;e hou&s;es and carriages are crammed with philo&s;o|phers who go on Sundays into the country to admire the works of nature as you call it? Indeed, from the reeling gait of &s;ome of them when they go back at night, one might take them for a certain &s;ect called the <HI>tipling</HI> philo&s;ophers. Then in an&s;wer to your charge, that a little trade&s;man can do no good, I mu&s;t tell you that I belong to the &s;ociety for relieving pri&s;oners for &s;mall debts, and to the &s;ick man's friend, and to.&mdash;</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Trueman.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then they are better &s;uited to petty men of petty fortune. I had rather have an ounce of real good done with my own hands, and &s;een with my own eyes, than &s;peculate about doing a ton in a wild way, which I know can never be brought about.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fantom.</SPEAKER>
<P>I de&s;pi&s;e a narrow field. Oh, for the reign of univer&s;al benevolence! I want to make all mankind good and happy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Trueman.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dear me! &s;ure that mu&s;t be a whole&s;ale &s;ort of a job; had not you better try your hand at a town or a pari&s;h fir&s;t?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fantom.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, I have a plan in my head for relieving the mi&s;eries of the whole world. Every thing is bad as it now &s;tands. I would alter all the laws, and do away all the religions, and put an end to all the wars in the world. I would every where redre&s;s the inju&s;tice of for|tune, or what the vulgar call providence. I would put an end to all puni&s;hments, I would not leave a &s;ingle pri&s;oner on the face of the globe. This is what I call doing things on a grand &s;cale. "A &s;cale with a ven|geance," &s;aid Trueman. "As to relea&s;ing the pri&s;on|ers, however, I don't &s;o much like that, as it would be plea&s;ing a few rogues at the expence of all hone&s;t men;
<PB N="226" REF="035296_0320_1001C1F9EE5E0E60">but as to the re&s;t of your plan, if all chri&s;tian countries would be &s;o good as to turn chri&s;tians, it might be help|ed on a good deal. There would be &s;till mi&s;ery enough left indeed, becau&s;e God intended this world &s;hould be earth and not heaven. But &s;till, bani&s;hing irreligion from the world would be like &s;triking off all the pounds from an over charged bill; and all the troubles which would be left, would be reduced to mere &s;hillings, pence, and farthings, as one may &s;ay."</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fantom.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your project would rivet the chains which mine is de&s;igned to break.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Trueman.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, I have no projects. Projects are in general the offspring of re&s;tle&s;sne&s;s, vanity, and idle|ne&s;s. I am too bu&s;y for projects, too contented for theories, and I hope, have too much humility for a phi|lo&s;opher. The utmo&s;t extent of my ambition at pre|&s;ent is, to redre&s;s the wrongs of a pari&s;h 'prentice who has been cruelly u&s;ed by his ma&s;ter; indeed, I have a|nother little &s;cheme, which is to pro&s;ecute a fellow in our &s;treet who has let a poor wretch in a work-hou&s;e, of which he had the care, peri&s;h through neglect, and you mu&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;t me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fantom.</SPEAKER>
<P>The pari&s;h mu&s;t do that, as to me I own that the wrongs of the Poles and South Americans &s;o fill my mind, as to leave me no time to attend the pet|ty &s;orrows of work-hou&s;es and pari&s;h 'prentices. It is provinces, empires, continents, that the benevolence of the philo&s;opher embraces; every one can do a little pal|try good to his next neighbor.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Trueman.</SPEAKER>
<P>Every one can, but I don't &s;ee every one does. If they would, indeed, your bu&s;ine&s;s would be ready done to your hands, and your grand ocean of be|nevolence would be filled with the drops which private charity would throw into it. I am glad, however, you are &s;uch a friend to the pri&s;oners, becau&s;e I am ju&s;t now getting a little &s;ub&s;cription from our club, to &s;et free your poor old friend, Tom Saunders, a very hone&s;t
<PB N="227" REF="035296_0321_1001C2010606EC48">brother trade&s;man, who fir&s;t got into debt and then in|to gaol, through no fault of his own, but merely thro' the pre&s;&s;ure of the times. We have each of us allow|ed a trifle every week towards maintaining Tom's young family &s;ince he has been in pri&s;on, but we think we &s;hall do much more &s;ervice to Saunders, and indeed in the end lighten our own expence, by paying down at once a little &s;um to re&s;tore to him the comforts of life and put him in a way of maintaining his family a|gain. We have made up the money all except five guineas, I am already promi&s;ed four, and you have no|thing to do but to give me the fifth. And &s;o for a &s;in|gle guinea, without any of the trouble, the meetings, and the looking into his affairs, which we have had, you will at once have the plea&s;ure (and it is no &s;mall one) of helping to &s;ave a worthy family from &s;tarving, of redeeming an old friend from gaol, and of putting a little of your boa&s;ted benevolence into action. Realize! ma&s;ter Fantom, there is nothing like realizing. "Why hearkee, Mr. Trueman," &s;aid Fantom &s;tammering, and looking very black, "don't think I value a guinea; no Sir, I de&s;pi&s;e money, 'tis tra&s;h, 'tis dirt, and be|neath the regard of a wi&s;e man. 'Tis one of the un|feeling inventions of artificial &s;ociety. Sir I could talk to you for half a day on the abu&s;e of riches, and on my own contempt of money.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Trueman.</SPEAKER>
<P>O pray don't give your&s;elf the trouble, it will be an ea&s;ier way by half of proving both, ju&s;t to put your hand in your pocket and give me the guinea without &s;aying a word about it; and then to you who value time &s;o much and money &s;o little, it will cut the matter &s;hort. But come now (for I &s;ee you will give nothing) I &s;hould be mighty glad to know what is the &s;ort of good you do your&s;elves, &s;ince you always ob|ject to what is done by others. "Sir," &s;aid Mr. Fan|tom, "the object of a true philo&s;opher is to diffu&s;e light
<PB N="228" REF="035296_0322_1001C2046345C900">and knowledge. I wi&s;h to &s;ee the whole world enlight|ened."</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Trueman.</SPEAKER>
<P>Amen! if you mean with the light of the go&s;pel. But if you mean that one religion is as good as another, and that no religion is the be&s;t of all; in &s;hort, if you want to make the whole world philo&s;o|phers, why they had better &s;tay as they are. But as to the true light, I wi&s;h it to reach the very lowe&s;t, and I therefore ble&s;s God for charity &s;chools, as in&s;truments of diffu&s;ing it.</P>
<P>Fantom, who had no rea&s;on to expect that his friend was going to call upon him for a &s;ub&s;cription on this ac|count, ventured to prai&s;e them, &s;aying, "I am no en|emy to the&s;e in&s;titutions. I would indeed change the object of in&s;truction, but I would have the whole world in&s;tructed."</P>
<P>Here Mrs. Fantom, who with her daughter had qui|etly &s;at by at their work, ventured to put in a word, a liberty &s;he &s;eldom took with her hu&s;band, who in his zeal to make the whole world free and happy, was too prudent to include his wife. "Then my dear," &s;aid &s;he, "I wonder you don't let your own &s;ervants be taught a little. The maids can &s;carcely tell a letter, or &s;ay the Lord's prayer; and you know you won't allow them time to learn. William too has never been at church &s;ince we came out of town. He was at fir&s;t very orderly and obedient, but now he is &s;eldom &s;ober of an evening, and in the morning when he &s;hould be rubbing the tables in the parlor, he is generally lolling upon them and reading your little manual of the new philo&s;ophy." "Mrs. Fantom," &s;aid her hu&s;band an|grily, "you know that my labors for the public good, leave me little time to think of my own family. I mu&s;t have a great field, I like to do good to hundreds at once."</P>
<P>"I am very glad of that papa," &s;aid Mi&s;s Polly, "for then I hope you won't refu&s;e to &s;ub&s;cribe to all tho&s;e
<PB N="229" REF="035296_0323_1001C206940BAB08">pretty children at the Sunday &s;chool as you did ye&s;terday, when the gentleman came a begging, becau&s;e that is the very thing you were wi&s;hing for; there are two or three hundred to be done good to at once."</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Trueman.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well Mr. Fantom, you are a wonderful man to keep up &s;uch a &s;tock of benevolence at &s;o &s;mall an expence. To love mankind &s;o dearly and yet avoid all opportunities of doing them good; to have &s;uch a noble zeal for the millions, and to feel &s;o little compas|&s;ion for the units; &s;urely none but a philo&s;opher could indulge &s;o much philanthropy and &s;o much frugality at the &s;ame time.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Fantom.</SPEAKER>
<P>I de&s;pi&s;e the man who&s;e benevolence is &s;wal|lowed up in the narrow concerns of his own family, or pari&s;h, or country.</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Well, now I have a notion that 'tis as well to do one's own duty as that of another man, and to do good at home as well as abroad, and I had as lieve help Tom Saunders to freedom as a Pole or a South American, though I &s;hould be very glad to help them too, but one mu&s;t begin to love &s;omewhere, and to do good &s;omewhere; and I think 'tis as natural to love one's own family and to do good in one's own neigh|borhood as to any body el&s;e. And if every man in eve|ry family, pari&s;h, and county, did the &s;ame, why! all the &s;chemes would meet, and the end of one pari&s;h where I was doing good, would be the beginning of ano|ther, where &s;omebody el&s;e was doing good; &s;o my &s;chemes would jut into my neighbors, and all would fit with a &s;ort of dove-tail exactne&s;s.</P>
<P>Here they were told dinner was on table. "Don't think," &s;aid Mr. Fantom, "that you have the be&s;t of the argument, becau&s;e you happen to have the la&s;t word. We will fini&s;h our talk &s;ome other time." So &s;aying they went in to dinner.</P>
<P>When t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> &s;at down, Mr. Fantom was not a little out of humor, to &s;ee his table in &s;ome di&s;order. Wil|liam
<PB N="230" REF="035296_0324_1001C20C72EAD9E0">was al&s;o rather more negligent than u&s;ual. If the company called for bread, he gave them beer, and he took away the clean plates, and gave them dirty ones. Mr. Fantom &s;oon di&s;covered that his &s;ervant was very drunk; he flew into a violent pa&s;&s;ion, and ordered him out of the room, charging that he &s;hould not appear in his pre&s;ence in that condition. William obeyed; but having &s;lept an hour or two, and got about half &s;ober, he again made his appearance. His ma&s;ter gave him a &s;evere reprimand, and called him an idle, drunken, vicious fellow. "Sir," &s;aid William, very pertly, "if I do get drunk now and then, I only do it for the good of my country, and in obedience to your wi&s;hes." Mr. Fantom, thoroughly provoked, now began to &s;cold him in words not fit to be repeated, and a&s;ked him what he meant. "Why, Sir," &s;aid William, "you are a philo&s;opher you know, and I have often over|heard you &s;ay to your company, that private vices are public benefits, and &s;o I thought that getting drunk was as plea&s;ant a way of doing good to the public as any, e&s;pecially when I could oblige my ma&s;ter at the &s;ame time."</P>
<P>"Get out of my hou&s;e," &s;aid Mr. Fantom, in a great rage. "I do not de&s;ire to &s;tay a moment longer, &s;o pay me my wages." "Not I, indeed," replied the ma&s;ter, "nor will I give you a character, &s;o never let me &s;ee your face again." William took his ma&s;ter at his word, and not only got out of the hou&s;e, but out of the country too as fa&s;t as po&s;&s;ible. When they found he was really gone, they made a hue-and-cry, in order to detain him till they had examined if he had left eve|ry thing in the hou&s;e as he had found it. But William had got out of reach, knowing he could not &s;tand &s;uch a &s;crutiny. On examination, Mr. Fantom found that all his port was gone, and Mrs. Fantom mi&s;&s;ed three of her be&s;t new &s;poons. William was pur&s;ued, but without &s;ucce&s;s, and Mr. Fantom was &s;o much dis|compo&s;ed,
<PB N="231" REF="035296_0325_1001C2127AB37358">that he could not for the re&s;t of the day talk of any thing but his wine and his &s;poons, nor harangue on any project but that of recovering both by bringing William to ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>Some days pa&s;t away, in which Mr. Fantom having had time to cool, began to be a&s;hamed that he had been betrayed into &s;uch ungoverned pa&s;&s;ion. He made the be&s;t excu&s;e he could, &s;aid no man was perfect, and though he owned he had been too violent, yet he &s;till hoped William would be brought to the puni&s;hment he de&s;erved. "In the mean time," &s;aid Mr. Trueman, "&s;eeing how ill philo&s;ophy has agreed with your man, &s;uppo&s;e you were to &s;et about teaching your maids a lit|tle religion?" Mr. Fantom coolly replied, "that the impertinent retort of a drunken footman could not &s;poil a &s;y&s;tem." "Your &s;y&s;tem, however, and your own behavior," &s;aid Trueman, "have made that footman a &s;coundrel; and you are an&s;werable for his offences."&mdash; "Not I, truly," &s;aid Fantom, "he has &s;een me do no harm; he has neither &s;een me cheat, gamble, nor get drunk: and I defy you to &s;ay I corrupt my &s;ervants. I am a moral man, Sir." "Mr. Fantom," &s;aid True|man, "if you were to get drunk every day, and game every night, you would indeed endanger your own &s;oul, and give a dreadful example to your family; but great as tho&s;e &s;ins are, and God forbid that I &s;hould attempt to le&s;&s;en them, &s;till they are not wor&s;e, nay, they are not &s;o bad as the pe&s;tilent doctrines with which you infect your hou&s;e and your neighborhood. A bad action is like a &s;ingle murder, but a wicked principle is throwing lighted gun powder into a town, it is poi&s;oning a river; there are no bounds, no certain|ty, no end to its mi&s;chief. The ill effects of the wor&s;t action may cea&s;e in time, and the con&s;equences of your example may end with your life; but &s;ouls may be bro't to perdition by a wicked principle, after the author of it has been dead for ages.</P>

<P>You take all your notions of the Deity from the vulgar views your bible gives you of him.&mdash;"To be &s;ure I do," &s;aid Trueman, "can you tell me any way of getting a better notion of him?

</SP>
<P>Some weeks after a letter was brought to Mr. Fan|tom from his late &s;ervant William, who had been turn|ed away for drunkenne&s;s, as related in the former part of this hi&s;tory, and who had al&s;o robbed his ma&s;ter of &s;ome wine and &s;ome &s;poons. Mr. Fantom glancing his eye over the letter &s;aid, "it is dated from Chelmsford jail; that ra&s;cal is got into pri&s;on. I am glad of it with all my heart, it is the fitte&s;t place for &s;uch &s;coundrels. I hope he will be &s;ent to Botany Bay, if not hanged." "O ho! my good friend," &s;aid Trueman, "then I find that in aboli&s;hing all pri&s;ons you would ju&s;t let one &s;tand for the accommodation of tho&s;e who &s;hould hap|pen to rob <HI>you.</HI>" Mr. Fantom drily ob&s;erved, that he was not fond of jokes, and proceeded to read the let|ter. It expre&s;&s;ed an earne&s;t wi&s;h that his late ma&s;ter would conde&s;cend to pay him one vi&s;it in his dark and doleful abode, as he wi&s;hed to &s;ay a few words to him before the dreadful &s;entence of the law, which had al|ready been pronounced, &s;hould be executed."</P>
<P>"Let us go and &s;ee the poor fellow," &s;aid Trueman, "it is but a morning's ride. If he is really &s;o near his end, it would be cruel to refu&s;e him." "Not I truly," &s;aid Fantom, "he de&s;erves nothing at my hands but the halter he is likely to meet with. Such port as is
<PB N="234" REF="035296_0328_1001C222C98E4DE8">not to be had for money, and the &s;poons part of my new dozen." "As to the wine," &s;aid Trueman, "I am afraid you mu&s;t give that up, but the only way to get any tidings of the &s;poons is to go and hear what he has to &s;ay; I have no doubt but he will make &s;uch a confe&s;&s;ion as may be very u&s;eful to others, which, you know, is one grand advantage of puni&s;hments; and be|&s;ides, we may afford him &s;ome little comfort." "As to comfort he de&s;erves none from me," &s;aid Fantom, "and as to his confe&s;&s;ions they can be of no u&s;e to me, but as they give me a chance of getting my &s;poons, &s;o I don't much care if I do take a ride with you."</P>
<P>When they came to the pri&s;on Mr. Trueman's ten|der heart &s;unk within him. He deplored the corrupt nature of man, which makes &s;uch rigorous confine|ment needful, not merely for the puni&s;hment of the of|fender, but for the &s;afety of &s;ociety. Fantom, from mere trick and habit, was ju&s;t preparing a &s;peech on general benevolence, and the cruelty of impri&s;onment, till the recollection of his old port and his new &s;poons cooled his ardor, and he went on without &s;aying a word. When they reached the cell where the unhap|py William was confined, they &s;topped at the door.&mdash;The poor wretch had thrown him&s;elf on the ground as well as his chains would give him leave. He groaned piteou&s;ly, and was &s;o &s;wallowed up wich a &s;en&s;e of his own mi&s;eries, that he neither heard the door open, nor <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the gentlemen. He was attempting to pray, but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> an agony which made his words hardly intelligible. Thus much they could make out&mdash;"God be merciful to me a &s;inner&mdash;the chief of &s;inners!" then &s;uddenly attempting to &s;tart up, but prevented by his irons, he roared out, "O God! thou can&s;t <HI>not</HI> be merciful to me for I have denied thee; I have ridiculed my Sa|viour who died for me; I have derided his word, I have re&s;i&s;ted his &s;pirit. I have laughed at that heaven which is &s;hut again&s;t me, I have denied tho&s;e torments
<PB N="235" REF="035296_0329_1001C22840F17098">which await me. To-morrow! to-morrow! O for a longer &s;pace for repentance, O for a &s;hort reprieve from hell." Mr. Trueman wept &s;o loud that it drew the attention of the criminal, who now lifted up his eyes, and ca&s;t on his late ma&s;ter a look &s;o dreadful, that Fantom wi&s;hed for a moment that he had given up all hope of the &s;poons rather than have expo&s;ed him&s;elf to &s;uch a &s;cene. At length the poor wretch, &s;aid, in a voice that would have melted a heart of &s;tone, "O Sir, are you there? I did wi&s;h to &s;ee you before my dread|ful &s;entence is put in execution. O Sir! to-morrow, to-morrow! But I have a confe&s;&s;ion to make to you." This revived Mr. Fantom, who again ventured to glance a hope at the &s;poons. "Sir," &s;aid William, "I could not die without making my confe&s;&s;ion." "Aye, and re&s;titution too I hope," replied Fantom. "Where are my &s;poons?"&mdash;"Sir, they are gone with the re&s;t of my wretched booty. But O Sir! the&s;e &s;poons make &s;o petty an article in my black account that I hardly think of them. Murder, Sir, murder is the crime for which I am ju&s;tly doomed to die. O Sir! Who can dwell with everla&s;ting burnings?" As this was a ques|tion which even a philo&s;opher could not an&s;wer, Mr. Fantom was going to &s;teal off, e&s;pecially as he now gave up all hope of the &s;poons: but William called him back. "Stay, Sir, &s;tay, I conjure you, as you will an&s;wer it at the bar of God. You are the cau&s;e of my being about to &s;uffer a &s;hameful death. Yes, Sir, you made me a drunkard, a thief, and a murder|er." "How dare you, William," cried Mr. Fantom, with great emotion, "accu&s;e me with being the cau&s;e of &s;uch horrid crimes?" "Sir," an&s;wered the criminal, "from you I learnt the principles which lead to tho&s;e crimes. By the grace of God I &s;hould never have fal|len into &s;ins de&s;erving of the gallows if I had not often overheard you &s;ay there was no hereafter, no judgment, no future reckoning, O Sir! there is a hell, dreadful,
<PB N="236" REF="035296_0330_1001C22CC01EF5C8">inconceivable, eternal!" Here through the exce&s;s of angui&s;h, the poor fellow fainted away. Mr. Fantom, who did not at all reli&s;h this &s;cene, &s;aid to his friend, "well Sir, we will go if you plea&s;e, for you &s;ee there is nothing to be done."</P>
<P>"Sir," replied Mr. Trueman, mournfully, "you may go if you plea&s;e, but I &s;hall &s;tay, for I &s;ee there is a great deal to be done. "What," rejoined the other, "do you think it po&s;&s;ible his life can be &s;aved?" "No, indeed," &s;aid Trueman, "but I hope it is po&s;&s;ible his &s;oul may be &s;aved." I don't under&s;tand the&s;e things," &s;aid Fantom, making towards the door. "Nor I nei|ther", &s;aid Trueman, "but as a fellow &s;inner I am bound to do what I can for this poor fellow. Do you go home Mr. Fantom, and fini&s;h your treati&s;e on uni|ver&s;al benevolence, and the ble&s;&s;ed effects of philo&s;ophy; and hark ye, be &s;ure you let the fronti&s;piece of your book repre&s;ent <HI>William on the gibbet;</HI> that will be what our par&s;on calls a <HI>practical illu&s;tration.</HI> You know I hate theories; this is <HI>realiving;</HI> this is philo&s;ophy made ea&s;y to the meane&s;t capacity."</P>
<P>Mr. Fantom &s;neaked off to fini&s;h his work at home, and Mr. Trueman &s;taid to fini&s;h his in the pri&s;on. He pa&s;&s;ed the night with the wretched convict, he prayed with him and for him, and read to him the penitential p&s;alms, and &s;ome portions of the go&s;pel. But he was too humble and too prudent a man to venture out of his depth by arguments and con&s;olations which he was not warranted to u&s;e. This he left for the mini&s;ter.&mdash;But he pre&s;&s;ed on William the great duty of making the only amends now in his power to tho&s;e whom he had led a&s;tray. They then drew up the following paper which Mr. Trueman got printed, and gave away at the place of execution.</P>

<HEAD>The la&s;t words, confe&s;&s;ion, and dying &s;peech of <HI>WIL|LIAM WILSON,</HI> who was executed at Chelms|ford for murder.</HEAD>
<P>I was bred up in the fear of God, and lived with credit in many &s;ober families, in which I was a faithful &s;ervant. But being tempted by a little higher wages, I left a good place to go and live with Mr. Fantom, who, however, made good none of his fine promi&s;es, but proved a hard ma&s;ter. In his &s;ervice I was not al|lowed time to go to church. This troubled me at fir&s;t, till I overheard my ma&s;ter &s;ay, that going to church was a &s;uper&s;titious prejudice, and only meant for the vulgar. Upon this I re&s;olved to go no more; for I thought there could not be two religions, one for the ma&s;ter, and one for the &s;ervant. Finding my ma&s;ter never prayed, I too left off praying, this gave Satan great power over me, &s;o that I from that time fell into almo&s;t every &s;in. I was very unea&s;y at fir&s;t, and my con&s;cience gave me no re&s;t; but I was &s;oon reconciled by overhearing my ma&s;ter and another gentleman &s;ay, that death was only a long &s;leep, and hell and judgment were but an invention of prie&s;ts to keep the poor in or|der. I mention this as a warning to all ma&s;ters and mi&s;tre&s;&s;es to take care what they conver&s;e about while &s;ervants are waiting at table. They cannot tell how many &s;ouls they have &s;ent to perdition by &s;uch loo&s;e talk. The crime for which I die is the natural con&s;e|quence of the principles I learnt of my ma&s;ter. A rich man, indeed, who throws off religion, may e&s;cape the gallows, becau&s;e want does not drive him to commit the crimes which lead to it; but what &s;hall re&s;train a needy man, who has been taught that there is no dread|ful reckoning? Oh, my dear fellow &s;ervants! take warning by my &s;ad fate, never be tempted away from a &s;ober &s;ervice for the &s;ake of a little more wages.

<P>Mr. Trueman would never leave this poor penitent till he was launched into eternity, but attended him with the mini&s;ter in the Cart. This pious mini&s;ter never cared to tell what he thought of William's &s;tate.&mdash;When I ventured to mention my hope, that though his penitence was late yet it was &s;incere, and &s;poke of the dying thief on the cro&s;s as a ground of encouragement, the mini&s;ter, with a very &s;erious look, made me this an&s;wer, "Sir, that in&s;tance is too often brought for|ward on occa&s;ions to which it does not apply: I do not choo&s;e to &s;ay any thing to your application of it in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, but I will an&s;wer you in the words of a good man &s;peaking of the penitent thief."

<P>THE olde&s;t man living at Compton-A&s;hby, can|not call to mind &s;uch another hubbub as that which happened there &s;ome months ago, on the com|mon, ju&s;t before the poor-hou&s;e door. A number of men, women, and children, had formed a ring round one farmer Ru&s;&s;el, a &s;ullen, down-looking fellow, whom no one loved and every one feared; for his love of mo|ney had led him to be hard-hearted, and his power over the poor had made him in&s;olent. Never was there &s;uch a hi&s;&s;ing and hooting, and hallooing heard. Many of the&s;e people had been grievou&s;ly oppre&s;&s;ed by the far|mer, and now they had him in their power, they &s;eem|ed re&s;olved to &s;hew him little mercy.</P>
<P>Betty Jobbins beat the frying-pan with the key of the door, Sally Gore pounded the pe&s;tle and mortar, Nelly Shep&s;ton rung the warming-pan, Dick Devon|&s;hire blew the Ram's-horn, whil&s;t Nick Stafford and others gingled the &s;heeps' bells. It &s;o happened that one Mr. Britton rode up at the in&s;tant to enquire what was the matter, of two poor women who were &s;itting in the porch of the poor-hou&s;e. One of them, Amy Talbot, &s;eemed to be about &s;ixty years of age, but time
<PB N="240" REF="035296_0334_1001C23EC2231E80">had not cured Amy of go&s;&s;iping, or taught her to mend her cloaths. As &s;he had no turn for indu&s;try in her youth, &s;he &s;oon eat and drank up the little property left her by her parents, which might now have afforded her a comfortable maintenance; but no, Amy's tongue was always abu&s;ive and always bu&s;y, whil&s;t her fingers were &s;eldom employed. Wherever there was a go&s;&s;ip|ing in the pari&s;h, thither ran Amy with her rags flying about her, like a &s;care-crow in a cherry tree. Her &s;kin which was quite tawny, was never wa&s;hed; her hair had worked it&s;elf thro' the holes of her mob, half the bor|der of which was lo&s;t, and the flaps of it were always flying behind her; the pigs had one day eaten a hole thro' her hat as it lay on the ground, and a piece of it now hung over her eye like a black patch, her petticoats were all tatters, and her gown reached but little below her knees; it had been torn away bit by bit, till it was ravelled out to the above dimen&s;ions; her &s;tockings had no feet, and her feet were &s;lipped into a mi&s;erable pair of &s;hoes, which &s;he had not taken the trouble to draw up at heel, even when they were new; in one hand &s;he clenched her rags together, whil&s;t with the other, &s;he held a &s;hort pipe in her mouth re&s;ting her elbow on her knee, as &s;he &s;at cro&s;s-legged.</P>
<P>The other poor woman who&s;e name was Ap&s;ley, was of a very different ca&s;t from Amy; &s;he was the picture of cleanline&s;s and good hou&s;ewifery; &s;he was mending her apron, which though very coar&s;e, was as white as the driven &s;now; this good woman never &s;at at the door to take the air, but &s;he was doing &s;ome|thing; "it is a duty," &s;he would &s;ay, "to turn our time to the be&s;t account we can," and when her other employment was over &s;he would read a chapter in her bible. Mr. Britton a&s;ked her what occa&s;ioned the up|roar, and at the &s;ame time &s;lipped half a crown into her hand, giving afterwards a few half-pence to Amy, which he thought was more than &s;uch a dirty woman de&s;erved.</P>

Then &s;he fell to hooting and hi&s;&s;ing, till &s;he foamed at the mouth again; which having wiped off with the corner of her gown, &s;he &s;aid, "now Sir, I'll tell you: that fellow's &s;tomach has been well filled with every thing of the be&s;t, whil&s;t he has &s;tarved we poor almo&s;t to death, but 'tis likely to come home to him at la&s;t, and he may chance to &s;wing for it, and then we &s;hall all be revenged of him," and again &s;he fell to clapping her hands.</P>
<P>"Prithee Amy," replied dame Ap&s;ley very camly, "don't give way to &s;uch evil tempers; we have been hardly u&s;ed by the farmer to be &s;ure, but if we are chri&s;tians, we mu&s;t learn to forget and forgive." "If ever I forgive the villain," cried Amy, knocking the du&s;t out of her pipe, "may I never get another quar|tern of tobacco; revenge is &s;weet, Sir, revenge is &s;weet."</P>
<P>"To an unchri&s;tian temper I grant it is," &s;aid Mr. Britton, "but revenge is the wor&s;t pa&s;&s;ion that can en|ter the human brea&s;t, it is the very &s;pirit of Satan."</P>
<P>"It is a very fine remark truly, Sir," &s;aid dame Ap|&s;ley, "for to my thinking, a man who is always nurs|ing up an evil pa&s;&s;ion in his bo&s;om, is as if he cheri&s;h|ed a &s;erpent there, which mu&s;t &s;ting him to death at la&s;t; yet, Sir, I mu&s;t be bold to &s;ay, much as I want money, I would not accept of &s;h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">mer Ru&s;&s;el's fortune, if I mu&s;t take up the heavy burden of his crimes into the bargain." "Ah! dame, dame," interrupted Amy,
<PB N="242" REF="035296_0336_1001C24759317A68">"preach as you plea&s;e, I am glad at heart 'tis come home to the villain at la&s;t, things can't go on wor&s;e with us."</P>
<P>"Nor perhaps much better," an&s;wered dame Ap|&s;ley, "for, after all, 'tis a very unthankful office to have much to do with poor people, e&s;pecially if they have not the fear of God before their eyes; becau&s;e then they are abu&s;ive, and ungrateful to tho&s;e who are guar|dians over them; for the matter of that, Amy, have we not &s;everal old people in this poor hou&s;e, who have been drunken, idle, bla&s;pheming people all their lives; and though we live &s;o near to the church, not one of them has &s;een the in&s;ide of it for many years pa&s;t, unle&s;s when there has been Chri&s;tmas gifts' money to be giv|en away; but I think if I were the par&s;on, Amy, eve|ry Lord's day I would drive the whole po&s;&s;e into church before me, if they were able to &s;et one foo before anothe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">." "My good woman," &s;aid Mr. Brit|ton, "I am mightily plea&s;ed to &s;ee how u&s;efully you employ your time, for you have continued your work ever &s;ince we have been chatting together." "Time, Sir, is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he gift of God, and I mu&s;t account to him for it; be&s;ides, Sir, often when I am bu&s;ily employed at my needle, I can ponder on &s;ome text of &s;cripture; and I can &s;ay with king David, <HI>As for me, when I am poor and in heavine&s;s, thy help, O God, &s;hall lift me up.</HI> Now, Sir, although I am very poor, that is no rea&s;on why I &s;hould not be very clean; if my clothing be coar&s;e, that is no excu&s;e for its being ragged, and if I am lame in my feet, that is no cau&s;e for my fingers being idle; be&s;ides, Sir, a &s;titch in time &s;aves nine, and I frequently get a &s;hilling by mending &s;tays, or quilt|ing of &s;ervants' petticoats, when my health will per|mit."</P>
<P>"Ah! well," interrupted Amy, "I never had the heart to work unle&s;s I were better paid for it. But I &s;ay, dame, I will &s;ay, that I am glad at heart farmer Rus|&s;el
<PB N="243" REF="035296_0337_1001C24D418C7048">is in hold at la&s;t; <HI>live</HI> and <HI>let live,</HI> is my notion of the thing; but no, he went on from day to day, crib|bing and &s;craping &s;omething out of every body; and no &s;ooner did he get a little uppi&s;h in the world, than he took no more account of poor we, than if we had been &s;o many hedge-hogs, for all he was born and bred a|mong&s;t us; but for the matter of that, he han't been much kinder to his own family, for you mu&s;t know, Sir, his bitter temper cau&s;ed his only &s;on to run away from him, nor has any tale or tidings ever been heard of him." Here again Amy began hi&s;&s;ing and hooting the farmer, in&s;omuch that Mr. Britton began to think he &s;hould never get at the end of the &s;tory.</P>
<P>"Now, Sir," cried Amy at la&s;t, whil&s;t &s;he filled her pipe, "now I have got breath again, I'll tell you all how and about it. You mu&s;t know la&s;t hard winter. Sir, when bread was &s;o dear, and coals were &s;o &s;carce, farmer Ru&s;&s;el would not let the pari&s;h be at the expence of mending the thatch on our hou&s;e, &s;o that when the &s;now melted it ran in &s;treams down on dame's bed, by which &s;he lo&s;t the u&s;e of her limbs, and &s;he has hob|bled with crutches ever &s;ince: yet &s;he, fooli&s;h woman, &s;eldom complains: but off &s;he goes to her Bible for comfort, as another body would to a gla&s;s of gin, or a pot of beer, when <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ings go ami&s;s."</P>
<P>"The troubles of life," &s;aid dame Ap&s;ley, "are but as &s;hadows which pa&s;s away; but the chri&s;tian's re&s;t will be eternal: and certain I am, Sir, my weak nature would often have given way to &s;inful murmurings, but for the gracious promi&s;e of better things in the life to come. O! Sir," continued &s;he, "I have found it much more for my &s;oul's good, to ble&s;s Heaven for what I have, than to murmur for what I have not; though, to be &s;ure, I have &s;een better days," wiping her eyes with the corner of her apron.</P>
<P>"Indeed has &s;he, Sir," cried Amy, "for dame's hus|band was a man well to pa&s;s in the world; he rented a
<PB N="244" REF="035296_0338_1001C252B28A9170">&s;mall farm, and was accounted one of the mo&s;t indus|trious men in the country; and as to dame her&s;elf, up early and down late was her maxim: when all of a &s;ud|den comes that &s;ame knavi&s;h &s;coundrel there, farmer Ru&s;&s;el, and takes farmer Ap&s;ley's e&s;tate over his head, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">o was &s;oon after obliged to take up with day-labor|ing to maintain his family. by-and-by &s;ickne&s;s came on, want followed next, farmer Ru&s;&s;el &s;eized farmer Ap&s;ley's goods for a little debt, and at the end of a long fit of &s;ickne&s;s, he and his whole family were brought here to the poor-hou&s;e, where the man &s;oon after died of a broken heart; and yet, Sir, dame is for forgiving the farmer all this."</P>
<P>"That I do," replied &s;he, "&s;ince my ble&s;&s;ed Saviour not only forgave his enemies, but prayed to his Heaven|ly Father to forgive them al&s;o; and I &s;hould read my Bible to little profit, Amy, if I learnt nothing from &s;o bright an example; but, good Sir," &s;aid &s;he, turning to Mr. Britton, "your patience mu&s;t be quite tired, not to be yet made acquainted with all the hubbub yonder: but mo&s;t folks are &s;o fond of telling their own &s;tories, that they do not think of other people. There is, Sir, a poor &s;oldier found dead this morning, in the next pa|ri&s;h, and it is thought that farmer Ru&s;&s;el has had &s;ome concern in the matter, &s;o the people are now going to carry him before a ju&s;tice to be examined."</P>
<P>"And I hope he will be hanged, I hope he will be hanged," cried Amy, clapping her hands;&mdash;"and I hope he will live to repent," cried dame Ap&s;ley, wiping her eyes. Mr. Britton's curio&s;ity was now rai&s;ed, and he attended the mob to the ju&s;tice's.</P>
<P>Ju&s;tice Carter was an upright gentleman, ju&s;t &s;uch a man as a ju&s;tice of the peace ought to be. Before he admini&s;tered an oath to an ignorant per&s;on, "Think a moment, my friend," he would &s;ay, "before you ki&s;s this book, whether you can &s;tand to the tru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> what you are going to &s;wear, when you are called to be jud|ged
<PB N="245" REF="035296_0339_1001C257EE8B4C68">for it, before the God of Heaven and earth." No temptation could ever prevail on his wor&s;hip unju&s;tly to favor any man: the laws, he &s;aid, mu&s;t take their cour&s;e; if they were found &s;evere, he did not make them: it was his duty to admini&s;ter them.</P>
<P>"And, plea&s;e your wor&s;hip," cried one Jones, who &s;eemed to be the ring-leader of the mob, "we all hope that you will now take revenge for us on the farmer, for all the &s;piteful tricks he has played us."</P>
<P>"I &s;hould make but an ill u&s;e of power, Jones," re|plied the ju&s;tice, "If I were to do any thing from heat or pa&s;&s;ion; if the law acquits farmer Ru&s;&s;el, I &s;hall rea|dily di&s;mi&s;s him."</P>
<P>"Well, to be &s;ure," cried the people all in a breath, "your wor&s;hip mu&s;t be a very fine chri&s;tian, to forget and forgive at this rat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> for, to our certain knowledge, the farmer has been a plague to you your&s;elf the&s;e ten years, &s;neering at you many times, and &s;aying that nei|ther you nor the l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> could take hold of him." "Now, do not you &s;ee," replied the ju&s;tice, "that all that has nothing to do with the pre&s;ent matter?"</P>
<P>Then turning over a great book, as big as a church bible, the witne&s;s was called, who depo&s;ed upon oath, that the la&s;t evening, ju&s;t between light and dark, he &s;aw farmer Ru&s;&s;el dragging a &s;oldier-like looking man over Compton bridge, clear out of his own pari&s;h into the next, that he there laid him down by the &s;ide of a ditch; that at fir&s;t he, the witne&s;s, believed the man to be dead; but that, in a &s;hort time, he found the poor fellow had only &s;ainted through weakne&s;s; that the wit|ne&s;s had lent the poor &s;oldier all the a&s;&s;i&s;tance in his power; but that he was obliged &s;oon after to follow his cattle."</P>
<P>Here the witne&s;s's evidence clo&s;ed. "And could you," &s;aid the ju&s;tice to farmer Ru&s;&s;el, "drag a poor traveller out of your pari&s;h in this barbarous manner? In order to &s;ave your own pari&s;h a trifling expence, you
<PB N="246" REF="035296_0340_1001C259E76BACC0">did not &s;cruple to ri&s;k the life of this poor traveller.&mdash; You thought, indeed, that the darkne&s;s concealed you; but remember, though it &s;eemed dark, yet the broad eye of the Almighty was upon you."</P>
<P>The farmer then in a &s;urly tone replied, "that the man had no bu&s;ine&s;s in his pari&s;h, and that as for him&s;elf, no one could &s;ay he was unkind to the poor, for he paid three times as much to the poor-rates as any man in the pari&s;h, (the lord of the manor only excepted.)"&mdash; "And rea&s;on good," cried ragged Amy, who had fol|lowed the mob; "becau&s;e you are the greate&s;t renter in it; for by di&s;hone&s;t practices you have got all the &s;mall farms into your own hands; but, farmer, no one has heard you ever gave a penny out of your own pock|et to the poor, when the laws did not compel you, &s;o no thanks for your charity. And plea&s;e your wor&s;hip, e|very one here knows, that whenever a kind gentleman and lady &s;ent a few &s;hillings to be divided among&s;t us, if the farmer heard of it he would &s;top our pay till it was gone."</P>
<P>Both the ju&s;tice and Mr. Britton quite &s;h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">delered a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> this act of cruelty, and every one pre&s;ent hoped his wor|&s;hip would not &s;ail to take ample revenge on the far|mer.</P>
<P>"My friends," &s;aid the ju&s;tice again, "if my brea&s;t harbored revenge again&s;t any man, I &s;hould be unfit for a magi&s;trate; did you never &s;ee the picture of ju&s;tice painted in my great hall? &s;he is there repre&s;ented as holding a pair of &s;cales with the balance quite even."</P>
<P>The ju&s;tice wi&s;hing to know &s;ome more circum&s;tan|ces about the man's death, the whole po&s;&s;e now moved off to the place where the corp&s;e lay, attended by Mr. Britton; by the way they accu&s;ed the farmer of every crime; &s;ome of which he had not, and others which he had committed. "Ah!" &s;aid one, "who &s;old eider for the very be&s;t, when it was proved it had been half filled up with water?" "Who," &s;aid another, "&s;old his
<PB N="247" REF="035296_0341_1001C25CE274F028">hay-ricks, all warranted good, and when they were cu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> open they were found crammed with mu&s;ty &s;tuff, fit only for littering cattle?" "And who," cried a third, "carried the be&s;t &s;amples of wheat to the market, and afterwards &s;obbed the buyer off with the very wor&s;t?" "And who," bawled out a fourth, "turned his own child out of doors, and mayhap murdered him, for no tidings have been heard of him &s;ince?"</P>
<P>Much after this ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ner they went on, and &s;oon af|ter the coroner pronounced a verdict of <HI>natura<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> death,</HI> no marks of violence being found upon the body.&mdash; The farmer now brightened up at once, and &s;ticking his hands in his wai&s;tcoat pockets, ca&s;t a malignant grin of triumph on all around him: "Now touch me if you dare," cried he, "but if my name be Ru&s;&s;el, I'll have my revenge of every man and woman's child of you; and I'll &s;pend a thou&s;and pounds at law, but I'll be a match for &s;ome of you.

Poor Ho&s;kins turned as pale as death, well knowing the farmer's unforgiving temper.</P>
<P>Here &s;ome one &s;earching the pockets of the decea&s;ed, was &s;urprized to find in them a letter, not &s;ealed, direct|ed to farmer Ru&s;&s;el, of Compton A&s;hby. The letter was offered to the farmer, but he refu&s;ed to take it, ha|ving always thought it unlucky to touch any thing be|longing to the dead.

<P>Many tears were &s;hed whil&s;t Mr. Britton read the letter. "My good friends," &s;aid he, when he had fi|ni&s;hed it, "let me now give you a word of advice:&mdash; Whenever a &s;ick and poor traveller (and e&s;pecially when a brave Briti&s;h &s;oldier or &s;ailor, who has &s;hed, his blood in fighting for you in foreign parts, and is perhaps e&s;caped from an enemy's pri&s;on) knocks at your door to a&s;k for charity, do not refu&s;e him a cup of beer, or a plentiful &s;lice of bread and chee&s;e; to you who abound it is little, to him it may be much; and henceforward let us all learn to look upon every man in di&s;tre&s;s as a child or a brother; and let us do by him as we would wi&s;h to be done by, if we were in his condition. As for you, farmer Ru&s;&s;el," continued he "no reproof from me is wanting, for the event that has happened is of it&s;elf the mo&s;t bitter of all reproofs."</P>
<P>"O my &s;on! my &s;on!" at length cried the farmer, (wringing his hands, and tearing his hair with grief) "my own cur&s;es have brought on my own de&s;truction! Wretch! wretch! that I am!" (here attempting to ri&s;e, he &s;unk down by the body of his &s;on, and then fell into

<P>The farmer's waggon now arrived to carry him home, and it was a mo&s;t moving &s;ight, to &s;ee it followed by the corp&s;e of his &s;on.

<P>"Of what u&s;e to me is all the riches in the world, now the afflicting hand of heaven is upon me? My pun|i&s;hment is great, great al&s;o has been my crime.

Rachel was al&s;o a famous interpreter of dreams, and could di&s;tingui&s;h exactly between the fate of any two per&s;ons who happened to have a mole on the right or the left cheek. She had a cunning way of getting her&s;elf off when any of her prophecies failed. When &s;he explained a dream according to the natural appear|ance of things, and it did not come to pa&s;s; then &s;he would get out of that &s;crape by &s;aying, that "this &s;ort of dreams went by contraries." Now of two very op|po&s;ite things the chance always is that one of them may turn out to be tru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, &s;o in either ca&s;e &s;he kept up the cheat.</P>
<P>Rachel in one of her rambles &s;topped at the hou&s;e of Farmer Jenkins. She contrived to call when &s;he knew the ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e was from home, which indeed was her u&s;ual way. She knocked at the door; the maids being out hay-making, Mrs. Jenkins went to open it her&s;elf. Rachel a&s;ked her if &s;he would plea&s;e to let her light her pipe? This was a common pre|tence, when &s;he could find no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">er way of getting into a hou&s;e. While &s;he was filling her pipe, &s;he looked at Mrs. Jenkins and &s;aid, &s;he could tell her &s;ome good fortune. The farmer's wife, who was a very inoffen|&s;ive, but a weak and &s;uper&s;titious woman, was curi|ous to know what &s;he meant. Rachel then looked a|bout very carefully, and &s;hutting the door with a mys|terious air, a&s;ked her if &s;he was &s;ure nobody would hear them. This appearance of my&s;tery was at once de|lightful and terrifying to Mrs. Jenkins, who bid the cunning woman &s;peak out. "Then," &s;aid Rachel, in a &s;olemn whi&s;per, "there is to my certain knowledge a pot of money hid under one of the &s;tones in your cel|lar." "Indeed," &s;aid Mrs. Jenkins, "it is impo&s;&s;ible, for now I think of it, I dreamt la&s;t night I was in pri|&s;on for debt." "Did you indeed?" &s;aid Rachel, "that is quite &s;urpri&s;ing. Did you dream before twelve o'clock or after?" "O it was this morning, ju&s;t be|fore
<PB N="253" REF="035296_0347_1001C28787000DA0">I awoke. "Then I am &s;ure it is true, for morn|ing dreams always go by contraries," cried Rachel.&mdash; "How lucky it is you dreamt it &s;o late." Mrs. Jen|kins could hardly contain her joy, and a&s;ked "how the money was to be come at." "There is but one way," &s;aid Rachel, "I mu&s;t go into the cellar. I know by my art under which &s;tone it lies, but I mu&s;t not tell." They then both went down into the cellar, but Rachel refu&s;ed to point at the &s;tone unle&s;s Mrs. Jenkins would put five pieces of gold into a ba&s;on and do as &s;he direct|ed. The &s;imple woman in&s;tead of turning her out of doors for a cheat, did as &s;he was bid. She put the gui|neas into a ba&s;on which &s;he gave into Rachel's hand.&mdash; Rachel &s;trewed &s;ome white powder over the gold, mut|tered &s;ome barbarous words, and pretended to perform the black art. She then told Mrs. Jenkins to put the ba&s;on quietly down within the cellar; telling her that it &s;he offered to look into it, or even to &s;peak a word, the charm would be broken. She al&s;o directed her to lock the cellar door, and on no pretence to open it in le&s;s than forty-eight hours. "If," added &s;he, "you clo&s;ely follow the&s;e directions, then, by the power of my art, you will find the ba&s;on conveyed to the very &s;tone under which the money lies hid, and a fine trea|&s;ure it will be." Mrs. Jenkins who believed every word the woman &s;aid, did exactly as &s;he was told, and Rachel took her leave with a hand&s;ome reward.</P>
<P>When farmer Jenkins came home he de&s;ired his wife to draw him a cup of eider; this &s;he put off doing &s;o long that he began to be di&s;plea&s;ed. At la&s;t &s;he beg|ged he would drink a little beer in&s;tead. He in&s;i&s;ted on knowing the rea&s;on, and when at la&s;t he grew angry, &s;he told him all that had pa&s;t; and owned that as the pot of gold happened to be in the cider cellar, &s;he did not dare open the door, as &s;he was &s;ure it would break the charm. "And it would be a pity you know," &s;aid &s;he, "to lo&s;e a good fortune for the &s;ake of a draught of cider."&mdash;
<PB N="254" REF="035296_0348_1001C28C180AA1F0">The farmer, who was not &s;o ea&s;ily impo&s;ed upon, &s;us|pected a trict. He demanded the key, and went and opened the cellar door. He found the ba&s;on, and in it five round pieces of tin covered with powder. Mrs. Jenkins bur&s;t out a crying; but the farmer thought of nothing but of getting a warrant to apprehend the cunning woman. Indeed &s;he well proved her claim to that name, when &s;he in&s;i&s;ted that the cellar door might be kept locked till &s;he had time to get out of the reach of all pur&s;uit.</P>
<P>Poor Sally Evans! I am &s;ure &s;he rued the day that ever &s;he li&s;tened to a fortune teller! S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lly was as harm|le&s;s a girl as ever churned a pound of butter; but Sal|ly was ignorant and &s;uper&s;titious. She delighted in dream-books, and had con&s;ulted all the cunning wo|men in the country to tell her whether the two moles on her cheek denoted that &s;he was to have two hus|bands, or only two children. If &s;he picked up an old hor&s;e-&s;hoe going to church &s;he was &s;ure that would be a lucky week. She never made a black-pudding with|out borrowing one of the Par&s;on's old wigs to hang in the chimney, firmly believing there were no other means to pre&s;erve them from bur&s;ting. She would ne|ver go to bed on Mid&s;ummer eve without &s;ticking up in her room the well known plant called Mid&s;ummer|man, as the bending of the leaves to the right or to the left, would not fail to tell her whether Jacob, of whom we &s;hall &s;peak pre&s;ently, was true or fal&s;e. She would rather go five miles about than pa&s;s near a church yard at night. Every &s;eventh year &s;he would not eat beans becau&s;e they grew downward in the pod, in&s;tead of up|ward; and &s;he would rather have gone with her gown open than have taken a pin of an old woman, for fear of being bewitched. Poor Sally had &s;o many unlucky days in her calendar, that a large portion of her time became of little u&s;e, becau&s;e on the&s;e days &s;he did not dare &s;et about any new work. And &s;he would have
<PB REF="035296_0349_1001C290DFB30550">refu&s;ed the be&s;t offer if made to her on a Friday, which &s;he thought &s;o unlucky a day that &s;he often &s;aid what a pity it was there were any Friday in the week! Sally had twenty pounds left her by her grandmother. She had long been courted by Jacob, a &s;ober lad, with whom &s;he lived fellow-&s;ervant at a creditable farmer's. Hone&s;t Jacob, like his name&s;ake of old, thought it lit|tle to wait &s;even years to get this dam&s;el to wife, be|cau&s;e of the love he bore her, for Sally had promi&s;ed to marry him when he could match her twenty pounds with another.</P>
<P>Now there was one Robert, a rambling, idle young gardener, who, in&s;tead of &s;itting down &s;teadily in one place, u&s;ed to roam about the country, and do odd jobs, where he could get them. No one under&s;tood any thing about him, except that he was a down-look|ing fellow, who got his bread nobody knew how, and never had a penny in his pocket. Robert, who was now in the neighborhood, happened to hear of Sally Evans and her twenty pounds. He conceived a long|ing de&s;ire for the latter. So he went to his old friend Rachel, told her all he had heard of Sally, and promi&s;ed if &s;he could bring about a marriage between them, &s;he &s;hould go &s;hares in the money.</P>
<P>Rachel undertook the bu&s;ine&s;s. She &s;et off to the farm-hou&s;e and fell to &s;inging one of her mo&s;t enticing &s;ongs ju&s;t under the dairy window. Sally was &s;o &s;truck with the pretty tune, which was unhappily u&s;ed to &s;et off &s;ome very loo&s;e words, that &s;he jumped up, dropped the &s;kimming di&s;h into the cream and ran out to buy the &s;ong. While &s;he &s;tooped down to rummage the bas|ket for the&s;e &s;ongs which had the mo&s;t tragical pictures, for Sally had a tender heart and delighted in whatever was mournful, Rachel looked &s;tedfa&s;tly in her face, and told her &s;he knew by her art that &s;he was born to good fortune, but advi&s;ed her not to throw her&s;elf a|way. "The&s;e two moles on your check," added &s;he,
<PB N="256" REF="035296_0350_1001C2929FE8D6A8">"&s;hew you are in &s;ome danger." "Do they denote hu&s;bands or children?" cried Sally, &s;tarting up and letting fall the &s;ong of the children in the wood; "hus|bands," muttered Rachel, "Alas! poor Jacob!" &s;aid Sally mournfully, "then he will die fir&s;t, wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">'t he?" "Mum for that," quoth the fortune teller, "I will &s;ay no more." Sally was impatient, but the more cu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o&s;i|ty &s;he di&s;covered, the more my&s;tery Rachel affected.&mdash; At la&s;t &s;he &s;aid, "if you will cro&s;s my hand with a piece of &s;ilver I will tell you your fortune. By the power of my art I can do this three ways; by cards, by the lines of your hand, or by turning a cup of tea grounds: which will you have?" "O, all! all!" cried Sally, looking up with reverence to this &s;un-burnt oracle of wi&s;dom, who knew no le&s;s than three different ways of diving into the &s;ecrets of futurity. Alas! per&s;ons of better &s;en&s;e than Sally have been &s;o taken in; the more is the pity! The poor girl &s;aid &s;he would run up &s;tairs to her little box where &s;he kept her money tied up in a bit of an old glove, and would bring down a bright queen Ann's &s;ix-pence very crooked. "I am &s;ure," ad|ded &s;he, "it is a lucky one, for it cured me of a very bad ague la&s;t &s;pring, by only laying it nine nights un|der my pillow without &s;peaking a word. But then you mu&s;t know what gave the virtue to this &s;ix-pence was, that it had belonged to three young men of the name of John; I am &s;ure I had work enough to get it. But true it is, it certainly cured me. It mu&s;t be the &s;ix|pence you know, for I am &s;ure I did nothing el&s;e for my ague, except indeed taking &s;ome bitter &s;tuff every three hours, which the doctor called bark. Indeed I lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t my ague &s;oon after I took it, but I am &s;ure it was owing to the crooked &s;ix-pence, and not to the bark. And &s;o, good woman, you may come in if you will for there is not a &s;oul in the hou&s;e but me." This was the very thing which Rachel wanted to know.</P>
<P>W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">le Sally was above &s;tairs untying her glove, Ra|chel <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;ipped into the parlor, took a &s;mall &s;il<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">er cup from
<PB N="257" REF="035296_0351_1001C299C87089A8">the beaufet, and clapped it into her pocket. Sally ran down lamenting &s;he had lo&s;t her &s;ix-pence, which &s;he verily believed was owing to her having put it into a left glove in&s;tead of a right one. Rachel comforted her by &s;aying, that if &s;he gave her two plain ones in|&s;tead, the charm would work ju&s;t as well. Simple Sal|ly thought her&s;elf happy to be let off &s;o ea&s;ily, never calculating that a &s;mooth &s;hilling was worth two crook|ed &s;ix-pences. But this &s;kill was a part of the black art in which Rachel excelled. She took the money and began to examine the lines of Sally's left hand. She bit her withered lip, &s;hook her head, and bade her poor dupe beware of a young man, who had black hair.&mdash;"No ind<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ed," cried Sally, all in a fright, "you mean black eyes, for our Jacob has got brown hair, 'tis his eyes that are black." "That is the very thing I was going to &s;ay," muttered Rachel, "I meant eyes though I &s;aid hair, for I know his hair is as brown as a ches|nut, and his eyes are as black as a &s;loe." "So they are, &s;ure enough," cried Sally, "how in the world could you know that?" forgetting that &s;he her&s;elf had ju&s;t told her &s;o. And it is thus that the&s;e hags pick out of the credulous all which they afterwards pretend to reveal to them. "O, I know a pretty deal more than that," &s;aid Rachel, but you mu&s;t be aware of this man. "Why &s;o," cried Sally with great quickne&s;s. "Becau&s;e," an&s;wered Rachel, "you are fated to marry a man worth a hun|dred of him, who has blue eyes, light hair, and a &s;toop in the &s;houlders." "No, indeed, but I can't," &s;aid Sally, "I have promi&s;ed Jacob, and Jacob I will mar|ry." "You cannot child," returned Rachel, in a &s;o|lemn tone; "it is out of your power; you are fated to marry the grey eyes and light hair." "Nay, indeed," &s;aid. Sally, &s;ighing deeply, "if I am fated, I mu&s;t; I know there is no re&s;i&s;ting one's fate." This is a com|mon cant with poor deluded girls, who are not aware that they them&s;elves make their fate by their folly, and
<PB N="258" REF="035296_0352_1001C29F1D36FD18">then complain there is no re&s;i&s;ting it. "What can I do?" &s;aid Sally. "I will tell you that too," &s;aid Ra|chel. "You mu&s;t take a walk next Sunday afternoon to the church-yard, and the fir&s;t man you meet in a blue coat, with a large po&s;y of pinks and &s;outhernwood in his bo&s;om, &s;itting on the church-yard wall, about &s;even o'clock, he will be the man." "Provided," &s;aid Sally, much di&s;turbed, "that he has grey eyes, and &s;toops." "O, to be &s;ure," &s;aid Rachel, "otherwi&s;e it is not the right man." "But if I &s;hould mi&s;take," &s;aid Sally, "for two men may happen to have a coat and eyes of the &s;ame color?" "To prevent that," re|plied Rachel, "if it is the right man the two fir&s;t let|ters of his name will be R. P. This man has got mo|ney beyond &s;ea." "O I do not value his money," &s;aid Sally, with tears in her eyes, "for I love Jacob better than hou&s;e or land; but if I am fated to marry another, I can't help it. You know there is no &s;truggling a|gain&s;t my fate."</P>
<P>Poor Sally thought of nothing, and dreamt of noth|ing all the week but the blue coat and the grey eyes.&mdash;She made a hundred blunders at her work. She put her rennet into the butter-pan, in&s;tead of the chee&s;e tub.&mdash;She gave the curd to the hog<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> and put the whey into the vats. She put her little knife out of her pocket for fear it &s;hould cut love, and would not &s;tay in the kit|chen, if there was not an even number of people, le&s;t it &s;hould break the charm. She grew cold and my&s;terious in her behavior to faithful Jacob, whom &s;he truly lov|ed. But the more &s;he thought of the fortune-teller, the more &s;he was convinced that brown hair and black eyes were not what &s;he was fated to marry, and there|fore though &s;he trembled to think it, Jacob could not be the man.</P>
<P>On Sunday &s;he was too unea&s;y to go to church; for poor Sally had never been taught that her being unea|&s;y was only a fre&s;h rea&s;on why &s;he ought to go thither.
<PB N="259" REF="035296_0353_1001C2A304DE7D90">She &s;pent the whole afternoon in her little garret, dres|&s;ing in all her be&s;t. Fir&s;t &s;he put on her red ribbon, which &s;he had bought at la&s;t Lammas fair; then &s;he re|collected that red was an unlucky color, and changed it for a blue ribbon, tied in a true lover's knot; but &s;uddenly calling to mind that poor Jacob had bought this knot for her of a pedlar at the door, and that &s;he had promi&s;ed to wear it for his &s;ake, her heart &s;mote her, and &s;he laid it by, &s;ighing to think &s;he was not fated to marry the man who had given it to her. When &s;he had looked at her&s;elf twenty times in the gla&s;s, for one vain action always brings on another, &s;he &s;et off, trembling and quaking every &s;tep &s;he went. She walk|ed eagerly towards the church-yard, not daring to look to the right or left, for fear &s;he &s;hould &s;py Jacob, who would have offered to walk with her. As &s;oon as &s;he came within fight of the wall, &s;he &s;pied a man &s;itting upon it. Her heart beat violently. She looked again; but alas! the &s;tranger not only had on a black coat, but neither hair nor eyes an&s;wered the de&s;cription. She happened to ca&s;t her eyes on the church-clock, and found &s;he was two hours before her time. This was &s;ome comfort. She walked away and got rid of the two hours as well as &s;he could, paying great attention as &s;he went not to walk over any &s;traws which lay acro&s;s. While the clock was &s;triking &s;even &s;he returned to the church-yard, and, O! the wonderful power of fortune tellers! there &s;he &s;aw him! there &s;at the very man! his hair as light as flux, his eyes as blue as buttermilk, and his &s;houlders as round as a tub. Every tittle agreed to the very no&s;egay in his wai&s;tcoat button-hole. At fir&s;t indeed &s;he thought it had been &s;weethrier, and glad to catch at a &s;traw, whi&s;pered to her&s;elf, it is not he, and I &s;hall marry Jacob &s;till; but on looking again &s;he &s;aw it was &s;outhernwood plain enough, and that all was over. The man acco&s;ted her with &s;ome very non|&s;entical, but too acceptable compliments. Sally was
<PB N="260" REF="035296_0354_1001C2A9B8D1F988">naturally a mode&s;t girl, and but for Rachel's wicked arts, would not have talked with a &s;trange man; but how could &s;he re&s;i&s;t her fate you know? After a little di&s;cour&s;e, &s;he a&s;ked him, with a trembling heart, what might be his name? "Robert Price, at your &s;ervice," was the an&s;wer. "Robert Price! that is R. P. as &s;ure as I am alive, and the fortune-teller was a witch! It is all out! it is all out! O the wonderful art of fortune-tellers!"</P>
<P>The little &s;leep &s;he had that night was di&s;turbed with dreams of graves, and gho&s;ts, and funerals; but as they were morning dreams, &s;he knew tho&s;e always went by contra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ies, and that a funeral denoted a wedding.&mdash;Still a &s;igh would now and then heave, to think that in that wedding Jacob could have no part. Such of my readers as know the power which &s;uper&s;tition has over the weak and credulous mind, &s;carcely need be told, that poor Sally's unhappine&s;s was &s;oon compleated.&mdash;She forgot all her vows to Jacob; &s;he at once for&s;ook an hone&s;t man whom &s;he loved, and con&s;ented to mar|ry one of whom &s;he knew nothing, from a ridiculous notion that &s;he was compelled to do &s;o by a decree which &s;he had it not in her power to re&s;i&s;t. She married this Robert Price, the &s;trange gardener, whom &s;he &s;oon found to be very worthle&s;s, and very much in debt.&mdash;He had no &s;uch thing as "money beyond &s;ea," as the fortune-teller had told her; but he had another wife there. He got immediate po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ien of Sally's 20 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> Ra|chel put in for her &s;hare, but he refu&s;ed to give her a farthing, and bid her get away or he would have her taken up on the vagrant act. He &s;oon ran away from Sally, leaving her to bewail her own weakne&s;s; for it was that indeed, and not any irre&s;i&s;tible fate which had been the cau&s;e of her ruin. To compleat her mi&s;ery, &s;he her&s;elf was &s;u&s;pected of having &s;tolen the &s;ilver cup which Rachel had pocketed. Her ma&s;ter, however, would not pro&s;ecute her, as &s;he was falling into a deep

<P>Rachel, whenever &s;he got near home, u&s;ed to drop her trade of fortune-teller, and only dealt in the wares of her ba&s;ket. Mr. Wil&s;on, the clergyman, found her one day dealing out &s;ome very wicked ballads to &s;ome children. He went up with a view to give her a repri|mand; but had no &s;ooner begun his exhortation than up came a con&s;table, followed by &s;everal people.&mdash;"Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> &s;he is, that is &s;he, that is the old witch who tricked my wife out of the five guineas," &s;aid one of them. "Do your office con&s;table, &s;eize that old hag. She may tell fortunes and find pots of gold in Taunton gaol, for there &s;he will have nothing el&s;e to do." This was that very farmer Jenkins, who&s;e wife had been cheated by Rachel of the five guineas. He had taken pains to trace her to her own pari&s;h: he did not &s;o much value the lo&s;s of the money, but he thought it was a duty he owed the public to clear the country of &s;uch vermin. Mr. Wil&s;on immediately committed her. She took her trial at the next a&s;&s;izes, when &s;he was &s;entenced to a year's impri&s;onment.

It is fooli&s;h, becau&s;e they are them&s;elves as ignorant as tho&s;e whom they pretend to teach, and it is &s;inful, becau&s;e it is pry|ing into that futurity which God, as kindly as wifely, hides from men.

<P>WE all of us are taught to &s;ay the ten command|ments, but there are few of us I am afraid who

<P>We read in the 20th chapter of Exodus (from whence the commandments are taken) that God &s;pake all the&s;e words, &s;aying, <HI>I am the Lord thy God, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt, and out of the hou&s;e of bondage.</HI> God was here &s;peaking to the Jews, who were of old his favorite people. The ten commandments were fir&s;t given to them, and through them to us. We mu&s;t not wonder, therefore, if we find a few expre&s;&s;ions which mited the Jews better than they will &s;uit us.&mdash;Let us now proceed to the explanation.</P>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="commandment">
<HEAD><HI>FIRST COMMANDMENT.</HI> Thou &s;halt have no other Gods but me.</HEAD>
<P>This means that we mu&s;t have, or chu&s;e to our&s;elves, the one true and only God of the Scriptures. Now in order to know who this God of the Scriptures is, it is plain that we mu&s;t read the Scriptures, and e&s;pecially the New Te&s;tament. He was the God who appeared to Mo&s;es, at Mount Sinai, and gave him all the&s;e com|mandments. He was the God of Abraham, I&s;aac, and Jacob, and all the prophets and holy men that lived on the earth. He afterwards was &s;till more plainly made known as the God and Father of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t whom he &s;ent into the world to die for our &s;ins, and he now &s;ends his holy &s;pirit into the hearts of tho&s;e who call upon him. It would take too much time to enter here fully into the character of God; let us therefore only repeat &s;hortly a few of the many things which the Scriptures have &s;aid concerning him. He is <HI>the high and lofty one who inhabiteth eternity. From ev|erla&s;ting to everla&s;ting he is God.</HI> He is the <HI>Almighty. His wi&s;dom is infinite: the light and the darkne&s;s are
<PB N="264" REF="035296_0358_1001C2C146D659D8">both alike to him. He &s;earcheth the hearts of all the children of men. By him actions are weighed</HI>&mdash;yea, he <HI>judgeth the &s;ecrets of men's hearts. Our God &s;hall bring every work into judgment, whether it be good or whe|ther it be evil,</HI> for <HI>he hath appointed a day in which he will judge the world in righteou&s;ne&s;s by that man whom he hath ordained;</HI> and <HI>then the wicked &s;hall go away into everla&s;ting puni&s;hment, but the righteous into life eternal.</HI> He is at the fame time a God of compa&s;&s;ion and of tender mercy. What can more &s;trongly prove it than his &s;ending Chri&s;t to die for us, and to offer &s;alvation to us. <HI>God is love. Not that we loved him,</HI> &s;ays the Apo&s;tle, <HI>but that he loved us, and &s;ent his Son to be a propitiation for our &s;ins.</HI> He de&s;cribed him&s;elf to Mo&s;es as being <HI>the Lord, the Lord God, merciful and gracious, long-&s;uffering, and of great goodne&s;s, keeping mercy for thou&s;ands;</HI> yet at the &s;ame time he will by no means excu&s;e or clear the unrepenting and the guilty. Moreover let us remark that he is the God of nature and providence; he made the world and he now governs it. <HI>Not a &s;parrow falls to the ground without his no|tice.</HI> He orders the events of nations and of individu|als. He doth all things both in heaven above and in earth below, <HI>according to the council of his own will,</HI> being righteous in all his ways, and holy in all his works.</P>
<P>Now, therefore, let us &s;eriou&s;ly apply this &s;ubject to our&s;elves, and fir&s;t as to our knowledge of God.&mdash; Is it then in the God of the Scriptures that we believe, or in &s;ome fal&s;e kind of Supreme Being who&s;e charac|ter is more &s;uited to our inclinations, and more indul|gent to our &s;ins? Do we believe in a God who will inflict puni&s;hment on the di&s;obedient, as well as &s;hew mercy to them that love him and keep his command|ments&mdash;who on the one hand is ready to pardon, and <HI>willeth all men to be &s;aved,</HI> and who on the other will &s;urely condemn <HI>the unbelieving,</HI> as well as <HI>plentifully
<PB N="265" REF="035296_0359_1001C2C3B2F9BA78">reward every wicked doer?</HI> Oh! how do men often mi&s;take the whole character of God; &s;ome in one way &s;ome in another, according to their various tempers, pa&s;&s;ions, intere&s;ts, prejudices, and conceits.</P>
<P>But having learned to know God aright, do we in the next place al&s;o reverence him, and fear him, and tru&s;t him, and love him and &s;erve him? Do we carry about with us at all times, a holy reverence and regard to God? And as to our fear of God, I would a&s;k, is it greater in us than our fear of man? When men re|quire or expect us to do a thing which God has com|manded us not to do, whom do we obey, God or man? that is the que&s;tion. In vain do we flatter our&s;elves that we keep the fir&s;t commandment if the fear of man is greater in us than that of God. Do we tru&s;t him al|&s;o? Do we tru&s;t him, for in&s;tance, both in our pro&s;pe|rity and in our adver&s;ity, and whatever befals us do we &s;ay that it is the Lord who hath done it, looking for|ward at the fame time to his help in all the future cir|cum&s;tances of our lives; or are we tru&s;ting in our&s;elves and in an arm of fle&s;h?</P>
<P>And here, above all, let us examine whether we love God: Do we love him as our Saviour, in &s;peaking of this commandment, expre&s;sly &s;ays that we ought to do. I mean, do we love him <HI>with all our heart, and &s;oul, and &s;trength:</HI> Do we love him more than we love our wealth, our plea&s;ure, our intere&s;ts, our earthly friends, or any worldly things whatever? <HI>Whom have I in heaven but thee,</HI> &s;aid the pious p&s;almi&s;t, <HI>and there is none upon earth that I de&s;ire in compari&s;on of thee.</HI> Do our hearts cleave to God as our be&s;t and mo&s;t de&s;irable portion? Is his favor all in all with us, and do we therefore &s;eek it carne&s;tly by prayer, and by all the means through which the Scriptures teach us that it is to be ob|tained? And to crown all, do we obey him and dili|gently &s;erve him? <HI>If ye love me,</HI> &s;aid Chri&s;t, <HI>keep my commandments</HI> When we &s;ay that we love a per&s;on, and
<PB N="266" REF="035296_0360_1001C2C6B5690110">yet refu&s;e to do the things he de&s;ires us, it is loving him in word only, not in deed, or in truth. Nor is it one commandment only that we mu&s;t obey. If a man <HI>keepeth the commandments of God, and yet offendeth in one point, he is guilty of all;</HI> for the &s;ame God that &s;aith, <HI>thou &s;halt not commit adultery,</HI> &s;aid al&s;o <HI>thou &s;halt not &s;teal.</HI> Nothing more plainly proves men to be hol|low and in&s;incere in their whole religion than their pro|fe&s;&s;ing to &s;erve God indeed in &s;ome things, but refu&s;ing to do it in others. Such men do not truly &s;erve God at all.</P>
<P>Such is the fir&s;t commandment. It &s;ays, <HI>thou &s;halt have none other Gods but me:</HI> that is, thou &s;halt &s;et up no God in oppo&s;ition to me, neither thy lu&s;ts nor thy pa&s;&s;ions, neither the world nor the fle&s;h, nor yet any of the fal&s;e Gods whom men's own imaginations have formed to them&s;elves, nor whom the heathen fall down and wor&s;hip.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="commandment">
<HEAD><HI>SECOND COMMANDMENT.</HI> Thou &s;halt not make to thy&s;elf any graven image, nor the likene&s;s of any thing that is in the heaven above, or in the earth beneath, or in the waters under the earth. Thou &s;halt not bow down to them, nor wor&s;hip them; for I the Lord thy God am a jealous God, and vi&s;it the &s;ins of the fathers upon the children, unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me: and &s;hew mercy unto thou&s;ands of them that love me, and keep my commandments.</HEAD>
<P>This commandment was directed more particularly to the Jews. God had &s;eparated them from the &s;ur|rounding nations, who were idolatrous, and had made a covenant with them, that they &s;hould not make to them|&s;elves Gods, &s;uch as their neighbors wor&s;hipped, but that he &s;hould be their God, and they &s;hould be his people. He &s;ays in this commandment, that he is a jealous God, that is, jealous of his honor. It is &s;aid in
<PB N="267" REF="035296_0361_1001C2CE63876DB0">another place, <HI>my glory will I not give to another, nei|ther my prai&s;e to graven images.</HI> He will have no ri|vals in any re&s;pect. The declaration, that he would vi&s;it the &s;ins of the fathers upon the children even to the third and fourth generation, is to be under&s;tood as a part of that national covenant which God made with the Jews. If the fathers wor&s;hipped and &s;erved him, then the children al&s;o would continue to have him in like manner, for their God: but if the fathers went a|&s;tray, and did as the heathen, then al&s;o the children for generation after generation were to be involved in the con&s;equences. Somewhat in like manner indeed it of|ten happens now, that children &s;uffer through the crimes of their parents, which &s;hould be an argument with all parents both to avoid &s;inning them&s;elves, and to take care le&s;t they draw their children into &s;in and mi&s;ery al&s;o.</P>
<P>Let us then abhor this &s;in of idolatry. It was one into which the Jews were continually falling; and let it be our prayer, as well as our endeavor, that all the nations of the earth, who are now &s;unk in idolatry, may be recovered out of it; for it is a &s;in highly offen|&s;ive to God.</P>
<P>Let us our&s;elves keep at the greate&s;t di&s;tance from this &s;in, and for this purpo&s;e it &s;eems prudent not even to adorn our churches with images, le&s;t any of the peo|ple who &s;ee them there, forgetting that God is a &s;pirit, &s;hould pay undue honor to the repre&s;entation.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="commandment">
<HEAD><HI>THIRD COMMANDMENT.</HI> Thou &s;halt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain, for the Lord will not hold him guiltle&s;s who ta|keth his name in vain.</HEAD>
<P>To take the name of God in vain is, in the &s;trong|e&s;t and wor&s;t &s;en&s;e of the words, to call on God to witne&s;s a thing that is fal&s;e, or in other words, to take a fal&s;e oath. In many ca&s;es men are required by law to
<PB N="268" REF="035296_0362_1001C2D4130F6118">make oath of the truth of what they &s;ay. Now what &s;olemnity and fear of God &s;hould there be in our minds on &s;uch occa&s;ions! The judge and the jury indeed may po&s;&s;ibly not find us out, but <HI>the Lord our God will not hold us guiltle&s;s if we thus dreadfully take his name in vain.</HI></P>
<P>We may here remark by the way, that it is this fear of God therefore, which is the chief &s;ecurity of the lives and properties of people in &s;ociety. Now I think it cannot be too &s;trongly in&s;i&s;ted on, that it is a very &s;o|lemn thing to call on God to witne&s;s any thing we are at but to utter, and that therefore, all restle&s;sne&s;s and in con&s;ideration in taking eaths, even though the oaths &s;hould not be fal&s;e, are very &s;inful. There are &s;ome who take cu&s;tom-hou&s;e oaths in a very &s;lovenly manner, and who &s;ay, "O it is only a cu&s;tom-hou&s;e oath."&mdash; Others take oaths of office ju&s;t as lightly, and I believe there are &s;ome who now and then take oaths of a grave and &s;olemn nature in their pa&s;times and in mere &s;port. But let all &s;uch weigh well tho&s;e awful words, <HI>the Lord will not hold him guiltle&s;s that taketh his name in vain.</HI></P>
<P>The next practice we &s;hall &s;peak of is that of com|mon &s;wearing, a &s;in which has not the excu&s;e which mo&s;t other &s;ins have, of &s;ome pre&s;ent plea&s;ure or profit having tempted the per&s;on to it. That awful name which angels reverence and adore, and which all good men cannot hear without a peculiar emotion, is t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">fied with, and in that &s;en&s;e, taken in vain by a great part of our fellow-creatures almo&s;t every hour of every day.&mdash; Some add cur&s;ing to this profane mention of the name of God, and often of the mo&s;t horrid kind, and, per|haps, when they cur&s;e and &s;wear, do not know that they me doing it, which they think is an excu&s;e, but which ought other to be con&s;idered as a proof to what an awful pa&s;s the habit has gone. Others, equally without knowing i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, u&s;e the name of God to expre&s;s
<PB N="269" REF="035296_0363_1001C2D678C26158">their &s;urpri&s;e, or to make their conver&s;ation, as they think, more entertaining. Ah! how dreadful will it be for &s;uch per&s;ons to have all the&s;e words brought a|gain&s;t them, as &s;o many unexpected &s;ins, on the day of judgment.</P>
<P>But it is nece&s;&s;ary to be &s;till more plain and particu|lar on this head, for the very per&s;ons who are mo&s;t guilty of this &s;in oftentimes cannot, or will not under|&s;tand that what is &s;aid is addre&s;&s;ed per&s;onally to them. To prove the ju&s;tice of what we are about to add, I would here fir&s;t call to my render's recollection what our Saviour him&s;elf has ob&s;erved on the &s;ubject of this commandment. <HI>Ye have heard,</HI> &s;aid he, <HI>how it hath been &s;aid by them of old time, thou &s;halt not for &s;wear thy&s;elf, but &s;hall perform unto the Lord thine oaths; but I &s;ay unto you, &s;wear not at all, neither by heaven, for it is God's throne, nor by the earth, for it is his foot|&s;tool.</HI> To &s;ay by heavens, or good heavens (the very expre&s;&s;ion which &s;ome people u&s;e now) is thus expre&s;s|ly forbid by our Saviour. But not only this one phra&s;e which happened to be the one in common u&s;e in Chri&s;t's time, but all others of a like kind are of cour&s;e by the &s;ame precept forbidden. It is painful to mention the various ways of being profane, which irreligious men from time to time have invented; but for the &s;ake of being under&s;tood, it &s;eems nece&s;&s;ary here in &s;ome de|gree to do &s;o. I would ob&s;erve therefore, that &s;uch phra&s;es as the following: "Ble&s;s me," meaning Lord ble&s;s me, "Mercy on me," meaning Lord have mercy on me, "By Jove," meaning by the heathen God Jove or Jupiter, "Upon my &s;oul," "Faith," and a variety of others appear all to be forbidden. <HI>Let your communication,</HI> &s;ays Chri&s;t, <HI>be yea, yea, nay, nay,</HI> that is, let your a&s;&s;ertions be plain and &s;imple, and not pro|fane or violent. Let them con&s;i&s;t as much as po&s;&s;ible in a &s;imple yes and no; <HI>for what&s;oever is more than this cometh of evil.</HI> Sin begins whenever we depart
<PB N="270" REF="035296_0364_1001C2D824C09D78">from this &s;implicity and purity of &s;peech, and it &s;eems even to be declared, that all tho&s;e profane expre&s;&s;ions which our Saviour alludes to, come from the wicked one.</P>
<P>We will clo&s;e this &s;ubject with two remarks&mdash;the fir&s;t is, beware of all violence and pa&s;&s;ion. Men &s;wear often through pa&s;&s;ion. To cure men's pa&s;&s;ion is there|fore to take away one cau&s;e of their &s;wearing; nay, re|member al&s;o that even all violent affirmations, all ap|peals to God or to religion which are needle&s;s, are of|fences again&s;t our Saviour's rule. It is a rule which calls us all to peculiar &s;implicity and &s;elf-command, in our conver&s;ation. Be calm, therefore; be not loud and boi&s;terous, but mild and gentle in your &s;peech, and in order to keep your tongue, learn al&s;o to keep your heart.&mdash;Learn, therefore, in &s;hort, tho&s;e doctrines of the go&s;pel which go to the correction of the heart.</P>
<P>My la&s;t ob&s;ervation is, be &s;erious. The world is full of people, who in one way or other are taking God's name in v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">in, and who do it, as was ob&s;erved before, with|out thinking of it; and the rea&s;on of it is, they are not &s;erious. They have no awe of the divine maje&s;ty, or of the divine pre&s;ence. They have not felt the power of religion in their hearts. They have no reverence for God and divine things, and hence it is that they &s;peak &s;o lightly of them. In vain do we multiply di|rections, not to u&s;e this or the other word, becau&s;e it is profane; a profane mind will be ever coining new words in&s;tead of the old ones which are forbidden, and will betray a per&s;on into profanene&s;s a hundred times a day without his being once a ware of it.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="commandment">
<HEAD><HI>FOURTH COMMANDMENT.</HI> Remember that thou keep holy the Sabbath-day. Sin days &s;halt thou labor, and do all that thou ha&s;t to do.&mdash;But the &s;eventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God: in it thou &s;halt do no manner of work, thou, nor
<PB N="271" REF="035296_0365_1001A3CF2E451BA8">thy &s;on, nor thy daughter, thy man-&s;ervant, thy maid|&s;ervant, nor thy cattle, nor thy &s;tranger that is within thy gates. For in &s;ix days the Lord made heaven and earth, the &s;ea, and all that in them is, and re&s;ted the &s;eventh day, wherefore the Lord ble&s;&s;ed the &s;eventh day, and hall<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">wed it.</HEAD>
<P>In the New Te&s;tament we find our Saviour ob&s;erving that <HI>the Sabbath was made for man, and not man for the Sabbath,</HI> that is, the Sabbath was made to be a benefit to man, and not a burthen to him. We who are chri&s;tians &s;hould peculiarly rejoice in it as a bene|fit. What a ble&s;&s;ing is it, in particular to the poor of this country, that there is one day in &s;even on which they may re&s;t from their work, and pa&s;s the day with their families in wor&s;hipping and prai&s;ing God, and in con&s;idering over all his m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rcies, as well as in exac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">in|ing into the manner in which they have been per&s;o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">n|ing their own weekly duties. The very brutes, in p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rt, &s;hare in the benefit, for this commandment mercifully provides a day of re&s;t for the ox and the a&s;s al&s;o.</P>
<P>It is proper here to remark, that &s;ome alteration has taken place in re&s;pect to the Sabbath, &s;ince this com|mandment was given. The day has been changed, for we keep now not the &s;eventh day of the week, which is Saturday, but the fir&s;t, which is Sunday, becau&s;e our Lord ro&s;e from the dead on the Sunday, and the name of the <HI>Lord's day</HI> has for that rea&s;on been given to it. We therefore unite two purpo&s;es together, for we both re&s;t every &s;eventh day as the Jews did, in im|itation of God, who made the world in &s;ix days, and then re&s;ted or cea&s;ed from his work on the &s;eventh, and we al&s;o commemorate the glorious re&s;urrection of our Lord and Saviour Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who, as on this day was rai&s;ed from the dead, after having died for our &s;ins and obtained eternal redemption for us.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the difference in the day it is natural that there &s;hould now ari&s;e &s;ome circum&s;tances of difference
<PB N="272" REF="035296_0366_1001C2E18DCBDC40">in the manner of keeping Sunday. The Jews, who often indeed mi&s;interpreted their own law, thought it wrong to pluck &s;o much as an ear of corn, or to heal a per&s;on of his di&s;ea&s;e on the Sabbath day, and in many other points they were extremely &s;trict. But we have been taught by our Saviour, that this commandment ought not to be con&s;trued &s;o &s;everely by us, and it is now generally agreed among the mo&s;t &s;erious chris|tians, that both works of mercy, and al&s;o works of ne|ce&s;&s;ity are perfectly lawful on the Sabbath-day.</P>
<P>But let us next endeavor to explain di&s;tinctly in what manner it &s;eems to us that a chri&s;tian Sabbath ought, under our pre&s;ent circum&s;tances, to be kept.</P>
<P>And fir&s;t, it &s;hould be con&s;idered by us as a day of re&s;t from our common labor. The very laws of the land require this, by forbidding &s;hops to be opened, and common employments to be followed on the Lord's day, and all magi&s;trates are obliged by their oath, to &s;ee the laws of their country executed in this re&s;pect. Eve|ry individual therefore is bound to ab&s;tain from the open violation of the Sabbath provided he reverences the laws or the public religion of his country, even &s;uppo&s;ing that he is not a chri&s;tian him&s;elf.</P>
<P>But chri&s;tians are called upon to keep the Sabbath holy in a much higher &s;en&s;e. The word holy means &s;eparate or &s;etapart from others, in order to a religious u&s;e. We &s;hould therefore con&s;ider the Sabbath as a different day from other days, and &s;hould carry that feeling habitually about with us through all the hours of it. Even if nece&s;&s;ity &s;hould oblige us to do &s;ome things which make a part of our common work, yet even then we &s;hould endeavor to bear in our minds all the while that it is the Sabbath. I urge this learing in mind that it is the Sabbath, becau&s;e I know that if this &s;entiment is in the heart needle&s;s work will be generally avoided, but that without this a man will not ea&s;ly be kept from breaking <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e Sabbath in one way or other.</P>
<P><PB N="273" REF="035296_0367_1001C2E62B5F8FB8">
Remember then that all common work, which can as well be &s;hifted to the Saturday or the Monday, be|comes &s;inful if done on the Sunday. Cleanline&s;s mu&s;t no doubt be attended to on the Sunday, but this is to be done by the preparation of Saturday. Our food mu&s;t be got ready; but this may be managed with very little trouble even in the large&s;t families, if there is but a dis|po&s;ition to &s;pare all kinds of labor on the Sabbath-day. There are many hou&s;es, I grant, which mu&s;t not be le&s;s quite empty during civine &s;ervice; but it is in ge|noral enough if one per&s;on is le&s;t at home, who may take turns with others, &s;o that the fan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e individual need not always be hindered from attending public wor&s;hip. There &s;hould be an univer&s;al agreement among mas|ters and &s;ervants, and among &s;ervants al&s;o with one another, each not only to ob&s;erve the S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">bbath him&s;elf, but to promote the ob&s;ervation of it among tho&s;e around him.</P>
<P>But now, to &s;peak of what is &s;till more material.&mdash;It It is of little u&s;e to ab&s;tain from bodily work, if the frame of mind is quite incon&s;i&s;tent with a due attention to the Sabbath. This would be a formal and Jewi&s;h Sab|bath indeed. To comply with the form, but to ne|glect the &s;pirit, is no true keeping of the chri&s;tian Sab|bath. It &s;hould even be remembered that if Jewi&s;h forms are in &s;ome re&s;pects left off, it becomes us to be the more careful to attend to the &s;ub&s;tance; for we are now placed under a di&s;pen&s;ation, in which all is expect|ed to be <HI>&s;pirit and life.</HI></P>
<P>The Sabbath, as was ob&s;erved before, was made for man. It was made for his good, and more e&s;pecially for his &s;piritual good. Whatever therefore tends to our &s;piritual benefit is fit employment for the Sabbath. Public wor&s;hip has been appointed on this principle, in all chri&s;tian countries. But it is nece&s;&s;ary that we &s;hould not only be &s;een attending in our places, but that our minds al&s;o &s;hould be engaged in the &s;ervice. In
<PB N="274" REF="035296_0368_1001C2EBE3B5FF90">prayer we &s;hould feel our need of the mercies we im|plore; in the confe&s;&s;ion of &s;in, we &s;hould be affected with a &s;en&s;e of our unworthine&s;s, and in offering up our thank&s;givings to God, we &s;hould pour out our whole hearts before him. And when we hear the Scrip|tures read, and the go&s;pel of Je&s;us Chri&s;t preached to us, we &s;hould li&s;ten with an attentive ear, and receive the truth into an hone&s;t and good heart. When we are returning from the &s;ervice, we &s;hould not di&s;cour&s;e as many are apt to do, about light and trifling things; but we &s;hould call up the &s;ubject which we may have been hearing of at church.

<P>Such are the occup<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tions which become a chri&s;tian on the Sunday, and uniting, as they naturally do, with the exerci&s;e of the &s;ocial affections, they may well employ the whole of this &s;acred &s;ea&s;on; for that is a poor motley incon&s;i&s;tent Sabbath indeed of which one little part on|ly is &s;pent at church, <HI>in building our&s;elves up in our mo&s;t holy faith,</HI> while the re&s;t is given up to &s;uch em|ployments as tend to pull down what we have been building up, and to promote forgetfulne&s;s of all that we have been hearing.

<P>THE Sacrament of Bapti&s;m, like that of the Lord's Supper, was appointed by Je&s;us Chri&s;t him&s;elf and no doubt for the wi&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;t purpo&s;es.

It is true the form of Bapti&s;m is &s;till continued among us. Pa|rents appear, almo&s;t with o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e con&s;ent, to bring their children to be baptized; but for what purpo&s;e do they bring them? Is it becau&s;e they really wi&s;h to pledge their children, and to pledge them&s;elves afre&s;h, to fight under the banners of Chri&s;t? Oh, no; for there are many who hardly once think of Chri&s;t in the matter. I appeal to the common ob&s;ervation of my readers, whe|ther the day of baptizing a child is not by many parents made to be little el&s;e than a day of extraordinary fea&s;t|ing, a day of vanity and o&s;tentation, a day at lea&s;t of n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">re worldly joy, on which, when the clergyman ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">
<PB N="277" REF="035296_0371_1001C2FB3763E6B0">done his office, not a word is to be heard of that <HI>king|dom of heaven</HI> whereof the child is now &s;aid to be a <HI>par|taker,</HI> nor of tho&s;e holy ends for the &s;ake of which bapti&s;m was appointed by Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>Godfathers and godmothers al&s;o have learnt, as well as parents, to be very incon&s;iderate about this &s;acred ordinance. They promi&s;e, indeed, in the face of God and of the church, <HI>to renounce,</HI> in the child's name, <HI>this wicked world, with all the &s;inful lu&s;ts of the fle&s;h,</HI> and they al&s;o are under&s;tood expre&s;sly to undertake that the child &s;hall be taught not only <HI>the Creed, the Lord's Prayer, and the Ten Commandments,</HI> but al&s;o, <HI>all oth|er things which a chri&s;tian ought to know and believe for his &s;oul's health;</HI> and yet the mo&s;t of them have no &s;ooner made this vow than they think they have done with it; they reflect not whether the parent be a per|&s;on who is likely to pay that attention to the child's &s;oul for which they have been engaging, nor do they ever afterwards be&s;tow a &s;ingle thought on its religious education them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Some there are, indeed, who do not act quite &s;o ab|&s;urdly about bapti&s;m, nor think quite &s;o lightly of it as many others, and yet are far from turning it to a truly religious u&s;e; they are aware, in part, of the profana|tion of it which is &s;o common, but they have not the courage to differ from the general cu&s;tom. They dare not refu&s;e, for in&s;tance, to &s;tand godfather or godmo|ther when&s;oever &s;ome one expects or reque&s;ts it of them. To do &s;o is a bad cu&s;tom, they allow, but &s;ince it is a cu&s;tom they mu&s;t comply with it. Ah, how little do they reflect, that in that very vow which in the child's name they are about to take, there is contained a pro|mi&s;e <HI>to renounce the world;</HI> in which promi&s;e the re|nunciation of its &s;inful cu&s;toms is no doubt included; and I therefore a&s;k &s;uch per&s;ons, whether the cu&s;tom of undertaking, lightly, the duty of godfathers and godmo|thers,
<PB N="278" REF="035296_0372_1001C2FE48115690">is not one of tho&s;e &s;inful cu&s;toms which the very ceremony of bapti&s;m pledges them to renounce.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, then it mu&s;t be acknowledged, that bapti&s;m is on all &s;ides neglected and profaned, and that it is be|come now little, el&s;e than a convenient ceremony, by which people be&s;tow a name upon their children.</P>
<P>But is this all that was intended by it? It &s;urely needs no argument to prove, that it was never meant by the founder of it to &s;erve merely as a national cere|mony, by which we were to regi&s;ter ages, or to give names to our children. It cannot be that a Sacrament ordained by him who died for us, enjoined upon his di&s;ciples nearly in his la&s;t words, and emphatically ur|ged upon us in tho&s;e remarkable expre&s;&s;ions, <HI>he that believeth and is baptized, &s;hall be &s;aved.</HI> I &s;ay, it can|not be that a Sacrament thus &s;olemnly appointed can de&s;erve to be lightly treated. Depend upon it, it can|not be made light of without affronting him who was the founder of it. It cannot be made light of without making light of Chri&s;t; without making light of him who is the hope of fallen man, and the only Saviour of our &s;ouls.</P>
<P>Let us then proceed reverently to enquire what is the true meaning and nature of it.</P>
<P>And here I would fir&s;t remark, that long before bapti&s;m was appointed there prevailed among the Jews the ceremony of circumci&s;ion, which had nearly the &s;ame u&s;e and de&s;ign. Abraham was the fir&s;t per&s;on on whom circumci&s;ion was enjoined. Abraham was cal|led by the divine goodne&s;s from a &s;tate of ignorance and idolatry, he was ble&s;&s;ed al&s;o with many great and glorious promi&s;es; he was made the father of the faith|ful, and was him&s;elf adopted into the family of God; in token whereof circumci&s;ion was required of him as a &s;ign, the &s;ame thing being required al&s;o of his children the Jews, who became the peculiar people of God; not that the mere &s;ign or ceremony could bring any one
<PB N="279" REF="035296_0373_1001C300112F5E48">into God's favor, for the apo&s;tles tell the Jews, that if they did not al&s;o <HI>keep the law, verily their circumci|&s;ion was made uncircumci&s;ion.</HI> And again it is &s;aid, <HI>for in Chri&s;t Je&s;us neither circumci&s;ion availeth any thing nor uncircumci&s;ion, but a new creature.</HI> The being <HI>a new creature</HI> was therefore the great point: and cir|cumci&s;ion &s;eems to have been intended to repre&s;ent to men in tho&s;e early ages, that new and holy &s;tate into which they mu&s;t be brought in order to their being in|troduced into the favor of God, uncircumci&s;ion repre|&s;enting on the other hand that &s;inful condition in which we are born, and in which we all naturally are, accord|ing to that expre&s;&s;ion of the apo&s;tle, <HI>and you who were dead in your &s;ins, and in the uncircumci&s;ion of your fle&s;h yet now hath he reconciled.</HI></P>
<P>Having thus made it appear what circumci&s;ion meant of old, let us next &s;hew from the &s;ame word of God what bapti&s;m &s;ignifies now.</P>
<P>When Nicodemus came to Je&s;us by night in order to enquire (as it &s;eems) into the nature of that new re|ligion of which he had heard, Je&s;us &s;ays to him, <HI>verily, verily, I &s;ay unto you, except a man be born again, he cannot &s;ee the kingdom of God.</HI> Nicodemus not under|&s;tanding what was &s;poken, our Saviour declares again, <HI>except a man be born of water and of the &s;pirit he can|not &s;ee the kingdom of God.</HI> What is it to be born of water and the &s;pirit? The an&s;wer I think will be found ea&s;y, e&s;pecially if we take advantage of the information given us in other parts of Scripture. Water, we there find, is the &s;ign ordered to be u&s;ed in bapti&s;m on ac|count of its clean&s;ing whatever is dirty or defiled; the holy &s;pirit however is the thing &s;ignified by the water; for as it is the bu&s;ine&s;s of water to clean&s;e the defile|ment of the body, &s;o it is the office of the Holy Spirit to clean&s;e the corruption of the heart of man. The mean|ing, therefore, of our Saviour's &s;peech to Nicodemus
<PB N="280" REF="035296_0374_1001C307458446F8">&s;eems to be as follows, "Except a man be renewed, or born again, and not by the outward bapti&s;m of water only, but al&s;o by the effectual inward bapti&s;m or puri|fication of the Holy Spirit&mdash;<HI>except a man be</HI> thus <HI>born, both of water and of the &s;pirit,</HI> he cannot &s;ee (that is, he cannot rightly under&s;tand, nor is he qualified to en|ter into) the kingdom of God. <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed,</HI> &s;ays our Sa|viour, <HI>are the pure in heart, for they &s;hall &s;ee God.</HI> It is our hearts then, and not our bodies only, that mu&s;t be baptized and purified. We are naturally corrupt, indi&s;po&s;ed to &s;erve God, and to obey his will and com|mandments. <HI>We are all,</HI> &s;ays Scripture, <HI>gone out of the way. Behold,</HI> &s;ays David, <HI>I was born in &s;in and &s;hapen in iniquity, and in &s;in did my mother conceive me. And you,</HI> &s;ays the apo&s;tle, <HI>hath he quickened who were dead in tre&s;pa&s;&s;es and &s;ins wherein in times pa&s;t ye walked according to the cour&s;e of this world&mdash;and were by nature the children of wrath even as others.</HI>&mdash;We are therefore exhorted not to be conformed to this pre&s;ent world, but to be transformed in the renewing of our minds. And the Scripture accordingly &s;peaks of true chri&s;tians as <HI>being clean&s;ed by the wa&s;hing of re|generation and renewing of the Holy Gho&s;t,</HI> and of their being <HI>wa&s;hed and clean&s;ed, and ju&s;tified in the name of the Lord Je&s;us, and by the Spirit of our God.</HI> The nece&s;&s;ity then of his death unto &s;in and new birth unto righteou&s;ne&s;s is plain and evident; for how can an unholy creature obtain the favor of a holy God, and become fitted for a holy heaven, without undergoing this change &s;o ju&s;t, &s;o rational is that &s;aying of our Saviour, <HI>ye mu&s;t be born again.</HI></P>
<P>There are many other pa&s;&s;ages of Scripture which equally &s;hew that to be a chri&s;tian is to undergo a great change in the natural di&s;po&s;ition of our minds, and al|&s;o that bapti&s;m is intended to &s;et forth to us this change. <HI>As many of you,</HI> &s;ays St. Paul, <HI>as have been baptized into Chri&s;t have put on Chri&s;t;</HI> that is, ye have put on
<PB N="281" REF="035296_0375_1001C30B8656DD20">the &s;ame di&s;po&s;itions that were in your Saviour, &s;uch as his humility, meekne&s;s, love to God and man, devo|tion, heavenly-mindedne&s;s; and again, <HI>for we are bu|ried by bapti&s;m into his death, that, like as Chri&s;t was rai&s;ed from the dead by the glory of the Father, even &s;o we al&s;o &s;hould walk in newne&s;s of life.</HI> When Paul him&s;elf fir&s;t became a chri&s;tian, Ananias &s;aid to him, <HI>ari&s;e and be baptized, and wa&s;h away thy &s;ins.</HI> Ana|nias does not merely &s;ay, <HI>ari&s;e and be baptized.</HI> No, the&s;e words are introductory to the words that follow. And &s;o is it in our ca&s;e. <HI>Wa&s;h away thy &s;ins,</HI> is an addition which we al&s;o mu&s;t make to our form of bap|ti&s;m. Nay, I will venture to remark, that bapti&s;m without this is not only u&s;ele&s;s, but it is even wor&s;e than u&s;ele&s;s. It does but aggravate our guilt; ju&s;t as in the ca&s;e of any other promi&s;e, he who promi&s;es, but does not perform, not only makes his promi&s;e void, but is even in a wor&s;e ca&s;e than if he had never made any promi&s;e at all.</P>
<P>The ble&s;&s;ings of the go&s;pel, it is true are, on that part of God, conveyed over to us in bapti&s;m, but they are conveyed over to us only on the &s;uppo&s;ition, that we al&s;o on our &s;ide repent earne&s;tly of our &s;ins, have faith in Chri&s;t, become regenerate, or born again, and walk in newne&s;s of life. If all the&s;e things are left undone, and are forgotten by us, our bapti&s;m is then like an a|greement as yet unfulfilled. It is like a contract or bar|gain, which has been made, but which one of the par|ties has afterwards rendered void, through his having ne|glected to fulfil &s;omething that he promi&s;ed in the very body of the deed. The other party is therefore let loo&s;e of cour&s;e. For let not the reader &s;uppo&s;e that there is any charm in bapti&s;m, and that on the &s;aying over of certain words by a regular prie&s;t, the gates of heaven fly open to him, his heart being now renewed and made regenerate of cour&s;e. Let not any one, I &s;ay, pre&s;ume to &s;take his &s;alvation on the truth of &s;o ab&s;urd a &s;uppo|&s;ition
<PB N="282" REF="035296_0376_1001C30D397EE328">as this. A per&s;on is admitted, I grant, at the time of bapti&s;m into the church of Chri&s;t, but it is only into the vi&s;ible church; for an outward form can only admit into the outward church; and it is al&s;o in the way of charity &s;uppo&s;ed (according to the form now in u&s;e in the church of England) that the baptized per&s;on both does and will fulfil his part, &s;o as to avail him&s;elf of the chri&s;tian privileges held out to him.</P>
<P>Let us then beware of this as well as every other er|ror, and as the Jews were continually warned by Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles not to tru&s;t in the form of circumci&s;ion, but to remember the thing &s;ignified, &s;o let us take warn|ing not to tru&s;t in the form of bapti&s;m, but to remem|ber what bapti&s;m &s;ignifies; for <HI>he is not a Jew,</HI> &s;ays the apo&s;tle, <HI>who is one outwardly;</HI> and in like manner, he is not a chri&s;tian who is one outwardly, <HI>neither is circumci&s;ion</HI> (nor bapti&s;m neither) <HI>that which is out|ward in the fle&s;h, but it is that of the heart and of the &s;pirit, and not in the letter, who&s;e prai&s;e is not of man but of God.</HI></P>
<P>It is proper that &s;omething &s;hould here be added, con|cerning the particular expre&s;&s;ions which our Saviour u&s;ed when he appointed the ordinance of bapti&s;m. When he had now fini&s;hed his work, when he had died for our &s;ins on the cro&s;s, and had al&s;o ri&s;en again, and was about to a&s;cend into heaven, <HI>go ye,</HI> &s;aid he to his di&s;ci|ples, <HI>into all the world, and preach the go&s;pel to every creature! Go ye and baptize them in the name of the Fa|ther, the Son, and the Holy Gho&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>In the &s;ame &s;acred names of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Gho&s;t (or Spirit) all chri&s;tians are now bapti|zed. Let us therefore clo&s;e the pre&s;ent &s;ubject, by en|deavoring to explain, in an ea&s;y and familiar manner, what it is that a true chri&s;tian, who is baptized, may be &s;uppo&s;ed to mean by each of the&s;e three &s;triking expres|&s;ions.</P>
<P>To be baptized into the&s;e three &s;acred names may
<PB N="283" REF="035296_0377_1001C30F3221D8D8">be con&s;idered then as &s;aying, in the fir&s;t place, "I be|lieve in God, the Father Almighty, who made and who now governs the world, and orders all things by his continual providence." It is to &s;ay, "I believe in that God of whom the Scriptures &s;peak, and not in tho&s;e fal&s;e gods which vain men have imagined to them&s;elves, whether they be gods of wood and &s;tone, or gods whom their own rea&s;on hath &s;et up in oppo&s;ition to the one true and only God of the Scriptures." It is to &s;ay &s;econdly&mdash;"I believe al&s;o in Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who is the Son of God, and who for us men and our &s;alvation came down from heaven, who was crucified, dead, and buri|ed, and who on the third day ro&s;e again from the dead and a&s;cended into heaven. I renounce, therefore, the vain hope of being my own Saviour; I own my guilt and unworthine&s;s. I tru&s;t in the merits of my Saviour's death, and in his power to &s;ave that immortal &s;oul which I have committed to him." It is to &s;ay thirdly&mdash;"I be|lieve al&s;o in the Holy Gho&s;t. I believe in the miracles which he wrought in the days of the apo&s;tles, whereby he te&s;tified of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. I believe in him al&s;o as my &s;anctifier. I depend on his help for that change in my corrupt nature of which I feel the need, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">nd while I am &s;triving earne&s;tly again&s;t my &s;ins, I implore the grace of this Holy Spirit, without which I know that I can do no|thing." It is to &s;ay al&s;o, that "I believe in him as my comforter. I draw my be&s;t con&s;olations not from the world, nor from the ordinary &s;atisfactions of this life, &s;till le&s;s from the indulgence of my pride or of my pas|&s;ions; but my highe&s;t comfort &s;prings from tho&s;e holy doctrines of the go&s;pel which the Divine Spirit has, I tru&s;t, impre&s;&s;ed on my heart; and from that humble per&s;ua&s;ion which he hath given me, that, for the &s;ake of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, God even now admits me into his fa|vor, and will hereafter receive me into his glory.</P>
<P>Such is the true meaning of our being baptized into the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Gho&s;t.
<PB N="284" REF="035296_0378_1001C316B60F7658">It is to renounce the Devil and all his works, the pomps and vanities of this wicked world, and all the &s;inful lu&s;ts of the fle&s;h, &s;o as no longer to follow nor be led by them. It is to chu&s;e in&s;tead of the&s;e, and as it were in defiance of them, and in direct oppo&s;ition to them, that Father, Son, and Holy Spirit which have been &s;poken of. It is to profe&s;s to live all our days in this faith, per&s;evering in it through all the changes and chances of this mortal life, in &s;pite of all the revolutions which may happen in the faith of our own country, or in that of &s;urrounding nations. It is to determine to hold fa&s;t this faith, into what&s;oever new place we go, and among what|&s;oever company we may chance to dwell, amid&s;t the &s;coff of infidels, amid&s;t the gain&s;aying of heretics, a|mid&s;t all the di&s;couragements or per&s;ecutions that may ri&s;e up again&s;t it in the world, amid&s;t the evil example of degenerate and corrupt chri&s;tians, and amid&s;t the united enmity and oppo&s;ition of all wicked men. And la&s;tly, to take on our&s;elves the chri&s;tian name in bap|ti&s;m is to profe&s;s that in this faith having lived, in this faith we tru&s;t we &s;hall not be afraid to die, &s;ince we are well per&s;uaded that we &s;hall not be a&s;hamed of having confe&s;&s;ed this faith on the great judgment day.</P>

<HEAD>Addre&s;s to tho&s;e Parents who are about to bring a Child to be Baptized.</HEAD>
<P>A general que&s;tion might indeed be a&s;ked&mdash;"But why &s;hould infants be baptized at all? Why &s;hould they be made to promi&s;e that which, on account of their tender age, they cannot perform."

Bapti&s;m you have ju&s;t &s;een is a &s;olemn thing.&mdash;It is not that light matter which &s;ome people make of it. Indeed, the manner in which parents are u&s;ed to bring their children to be baptized, may &s;erve as a te&s;t or proof by which we may try the reality of their whole religion. They who treat chri&s;tian bapti&s;m lightly, we may depend upon it, are altogether light and giddy peo|ple; nor is this all; to be light and giddy in a ca&s;e of this &s;ort, is to be profane and wicked al&s;o.</P>
<P>There is &s;omething indeed particularly aggravated in the guilt of tho&s;e parents who come in a trifling &s;pirit to attend their child's bapti&s;m. When the mother has ju&s;t e&s;caped from the pains and perils of child-birth; when the father has had the life of his beloved wife pre|&s;erved to him, and when they both are made the hap|py parents of a living infant, then is the time for com|ing and offering up to God, who is the deliverer, and in the name of Chri&s;t, who is their Saviour, their deli|cate and tender offspring. Is this then the time for light and giddy mirth? or for luxury, and vanity, and o&s;ten|tation? or for giving way to the evil cu&s;toms of an un|thinking
<PB N="286" REF="035296_0380_1001C31F9F455F00">world? and above all, is this a time for pro|faning one of the mo&s;t &s;acred ordinances of Chri&s;t? No; it is the time rather for the parents to think of their &s;ins, and to examine into all the errors of their own pa&s;t life. And as the right education of their new-born in|fant will now become the object of their thought, it ought certainly to occur to them, and to impre&s;s it&s;elf very &s;trongly on their mind, that an immortal being is now committed to their care, a being who&s;e &s;oul is like|ly to be &s;aved or lo&s;t, according as it receives from them a good or a bad education, influence, and example.&mdash;To have brought an immortal being into the world is, to every con&s;iderate mind, in it&s;elf no light matter; and for the parents to be the means not of &s;aving, but of damning the child to which they have given birth, is a thought too horrible to be borne. Many, therefore, who neglect their own &s;ouls cannot endure the idea of neglecting the &s;ouls of their children, and they are for doing &s;omething at lea&s;t towards what they call, the right education of their offspring; but let all parents remember that if they are light and profane, in&s;tead of being &s;erious and devout in pre&s;enting their child to God in bapti&s;m, the child is then introduced into life by an act which amounts to a &s;olemn mockery of God. And alas, is there not then too much rea&s;on to fear le&s;t (to borrow &s;ome words of the church of England &s;ervice) "the child &s;hould lead the remainder of his life, but too truly, according to this beginning."</P>
<P>But now to be more particular. Fir&s;t, then, before the time of bapti&s;m comes, be &s;ure that you offer up to God in &s;ecret the mo&s;t fervent prayers on the behalf of your infant. What is bapti&s;m? It is a Sacrament ap|pointed by Chri&s;t, in order to remind us that the natu|ral hearts both of parents and children need to be bap|tized or clean&s;ed by God's Holy Spirit; and how is this gift of the Holy Spirit to be obtained? By prayer; for God hath &s;aid, he will give his Holy Spirit to them that
<PB N="287" REF="035296_0381_1001C321DBD15680">a&s;k it. As then by prayer you are to &s;eek this gift for your&s;elf, &s;o are you to &s;eek it for your children al&s;o.&mdash;Pray then, I &s;ay, that God will give to your child <HI>that thing which by nature he cannot have;</HI> that he will en|dow him not only with kind and amiable tempers, but al&s;o with the &s;till greater gift of his heavenly grace.&mdash;Pray that he may not only be re&s;pectable, &s;o as to do credit to his family, in the eyes of men, but that he may have the fear of God al&s;o in his heart. Pray that he may be e&s;tabli&s;hed in the faith of Chri&s;t, and that he may be one of tho&s;e who &s;hall one day fight manfully under Chri&s;t's banners again&s;t Sin, the World and the Devil, and who &s;hall not be a&s;hamed to confe&s;s the faith of Chri&s;t crucified in the mid&s;t of a proud, a carele&s;s, and a wicked world.</P>
<P>Let me remark next, in re&s;pect to godfathers and godmothers, that it will be your endeavor if you are at all impre&s;&s;ed with the important nature of bapti&s;m, to chu&s;e them from among the mo&s;t religious per&s;ons of your acquaintance, and not merely from among tho&s;e who may be mo&s;t likely to help foward your child in his worldly intere&s;t; for, in a ca&s;e of this &s;ort, you mu&s;t ca&s;t a&s;ide the principle of worldly policy, and you may al&s;o have to act again&s;t the rules of civility, and common cu&s;tom. It is probable, indeed, if you have hitherto been a thoughtle&s;s, irreligious per&s;on, that your religious friends, if you have any, will be very &s;hy of &s;tanding godfathers or godmothers to your children. In order then to take away their objections, explain to them how &s;eriou&s;ly you now intend to bring up your offspring. A&s;&s;ure them that you account bapti&s;m a ve|ry &s;olemn thing, that you wi&s;h them to undertake for the religious education of your child on &s;erious princi|ples, and al&s;o that you &s;hall be glad to take advice from them from time to time on this &s;ubject.</P>
<P>In the next place, on the day of bapti&s;m, be careful to avoid all extravagant fea&s;ting and &s;hew, as well as
<PB N="288" REF="035296_0382_1001C32450C61910">levity. Do not prepare a va&s;t expen&s;ive dinner, but a decent and moderate meal, and beware of inviting a croud of irreligious people to be your gue&s;ts. Do not dre&s;s out the little infant in expen&s;ive finery, but re|member that you are about to dedicate him to one, who, when he gave a fea&s;t to his followers, was plea&s;ed to offer them nothing but a few fi&s;hes and barley-bread, who had not him&s;elf a hou&s;e where to lay his head, and who, when he was nearly of the age of your child, was laid even in a manger.</P>
<P>And when the day of bapti&s;m is over, begin imme|diately to prepare for the good education of your child, by taking all tho&s;e &s;teps which now become you. If there is any thing in your character and conduct which will reflect blame on you in the eyes of your offspring, and thus le&s;&s;en their reverence for you, endeavor to cor|rect all &s;uch things now. Are there any wrong habits which you are living in, be &s;ure to change them now. Have you any friends, who&s;e principles are &s;uch as to make them dangerous companions for your child, part them from all &s;uch friends now, and begin immediately to form &s;uch connections, and to e&s;tabli&s;h &s;uch religious cu&s;toms in your family, as may be of &s;erious u&s;e to your children.</P>
<P>Above all, la&s;tly, take this occa&s;ion of examining whether you have ever yet fulfilled your own vow in bapti&s;m; for if you have not, it is in vain to expect that you will do your duty religiou&s;ly by your children. Examine, then, whether the great end of bapti&s;m has been fulfilled in you; whether you have ever repented of your &s;ins, have turned to God, have learnt to deny the &s;inful inclinations of your heart, have refu&s;ed to fol|low the evil cu&s;toms of the world, and have become holy, as your profe&s;&s;ion of chri&s;tianity requires you to be. Examine, in &s;hort, whether you have got a chris|tian name only, or a chri&s;tian nature al&s;o. If you can|not an&s;wer the&s;e que&s;tions &s;atisfactorily, do not run a|way
<PB N="289" REF="035296_0383_1001C3279E6FE2A8">from the &s;ubject altogether, but rather take the opportunity which the affecting circum&s;tance of a child's birth affords you of con&s;idering over all your own ways and let the &s;ea&s;on of your child's being born into a new world be the &s;ea&s;on of your own death unto &s;in, and new birth unto righteou&s;ne&s;s.</P>

<HEAD>THE <HI>Servant Man turned Soldier;</HI> OR, THE FAIR WEATHER CHRISTIAN A PARABLE.</HEAD>
<P>WILLIAM was a lively young &s;ervant who lived in a great but very irregular family. His place was, on the whole, agreeable to him, and &s;uited to his gay thoughtle&s;s temper. He found a plentiful table and a good cellar. There was indeed a good deal of work to be done, though it was performed with much di&s;or|der and confu&s;ion. The family in the main were not unkind to him, though they often contradicted and cros|&s;ed him, e&s;pecially when things went ill with them&s;elves. This, William never much liked, for he was always fond of having his own way. There was a merry, or rather a noi&s;y and riotous &s;ervant's hall; for di&s;order and quarrels are indeed the u&s;ual effects of plenty and unre&s;trained indulgence. The men were &s;mart but idle, the maids were &s;howy, but licentious, and all did pret|ty much as they liked for a time, but the time was com|monly &s;hort. The wages were reckoned high, but
<PB N="290" REF="035296_0384_1001C3298B98AC78">they were &s;eldom paid, and it was even &s;aid by &s;ober people, that the ma&s;ter was in&s;olvent, and never fulfil|led any of his flattering engagements, or his mo&s;t po&s;i|tive promi&s;es; but &s;till, notwith&s;tanding his real pover|ty, things went on with ju&s;t the &s;ame thoughtle&s;sne&s;s and &s;plendor, and neither ma&s;ter or &s;ervants looked be|yond the jollity of the pre&s;ent hour.</P>
<P>In this unruly family there was little church-going, and &s;till le&s;s praying at home. They pretended, indeed, in a general way, to believe in the bible, but it was on|ly an outward profe&s;&s;ion, few of them read it at all, and even of tho&s;e who did read it &s;till fewer were governed by it. There was indeed a bible lying on the table in the great hall, which was kept for the purpo&s;e of ad|mini&s;tering an oath, but was &s;eldom u&s;ed on any other occa&s;ion, and &s;ome of the heads of the family were of opinion that this was its only real u&s;e, as it might &s;erve to keep the lower parts of it in order.</P>
<P>William, who was fond of novelty and plea&s;ure, was apt to be negligent of the duties of the hou&s;e. He u&s;ed to &s;tay out on his errands, and one of his favorite a|mu&s;ements was going to the parade to &s;ee the &s;oldiers exerci&s;e. He &s;aw with envy how &s;martly they were dre&s;&s;ed, li&s;tened with rapture to the mu&s;ic, and fancied that a &s;oldier had nothing to do but to walk to and fro in a certain regular order, to go through a little ea&s;y exerci&s;e, in &s;hort, to live without fighting, fatigue, or danger.</P>
<P>"Oh!" &s;aid he, whenever he was affronted at home, "what a fine thing it mu&s;t be to be a &s;oldier! to be &s;o well dre&s;&s;ed, to have nothing to do but to move to the plea&s;ant &s;ound of fife and drum, and to have &s;o many people to come to look at one, and admire one. O it mu&s;t be a fine thing to be a &s;oldier!"</P>
<P>Yet when the vexation of the moment was over, he &s;ound &s;o much ea&s;e and diver&s;ion in his ma&s;ter's hou&s;e, &s;o &s;uited to his low ta&s;te and &s;en&s;ual appetites, that he
<PB N="291" REF="035296_0385_1001C32B8DE3FFF0">thought no more of the matter. He forgot the glories of a &s;oldier, and eagerly returned to all the mean gra|tifications of the kitchen. His evil habits were but lit|tle attended to by tho&s;e with whom he lived; his faults, among which were lying and &s;wearing, were not often corrected by the family, who had little objection to tho&s;e &s;ins which only offended God, and did not much affect their own intere&s;t or property. And except that William was obliged to work rather more than he li|ked, he found little, while he was young and healthy, that was very di&s;agreeable in this &s;ervice. So he went on, &s;till thinking, however, when things went a little cro&s;s, "what a fine thing it was to be a &s;oldier!" and at la&s;t one day as he was waiting at dinner, he had the misfortune to let fall a china di&s;h, and broke it all to pieces. It was a curious di&s;h, much valued by the fa|mily, as they pretended; this family were indeed apt to &s;et a fal&s;e fanta&s;tic value on things, and not to e&s;timate them by their real worth. The heads of the family, who had generally been rather patient and good-hu|mored with William, as I &s;aid before, for the&s;e vices, which, though offen&s;ive to God, did not touch their own pocket, now flew out into a violent pa&s;&s;ion with him, called him a thou&s;and hard names, and even threat|ened to hor&s;ewhip him for his &s;hameful negligence.</P>
<P>William, in a great fright, for he was a &s;ad coward at bottom, ran directly out of the hou&s;e, to avoid the theatened puni&s;hment, and happening ju&s;t at that very time to pa&s;s by the parade where the &s;oldiers chanced to be then exerci&s;ing, his re&s;olution was taken in a mo|ment. He in&s;tantly determined to be no more a &s;lave, as he called it; he would return no more to be &s;ubject to the humours of a tyrannical family; no, he was re|&s;olved to be free, or, at lea&s;t, if he mu&s;t &s;erve, he would &s;erve no ma&s;ter but the King.</P>
<P>William, who had now and then happened to hear, from the accidental talk of the &s;oldiers, that tho&s;e who
<PB N="292" REF="035296_0386_1001A38FDEB63690">&s;erved the <HI>great family</HI> he had lived with, were &s;laves to their tyranny and vices, had al&s;o heard, in the &s;ame ca&s;ual manner, that the &s;ervice of the <HI>King</HI> was <HI>perfect freedom.</HI> Now he had taken it into his head to hope that this might be a freedom to do evil, or at lea&s;t to do nothing, &s;o he thought it was the only place in the world to &s;uit him.</P>
<P>A &s;ine likely young fellow as William was, had no great difficulty to get enli&s;ted. The few forms were &s;oon &s;ettled, he received the bounty-money as eagerly as it was offered, took the oaths of allegiance, and was joined to the regiment, and heartily welcomed by his new comrades. He was the happie&s;t fellow alive. All was &s;mooth and calm. The day happened to be very fine, and therefore William always reckoned upon a fine day. The &s;cene was gay and lively, the mu&s;ic cheer|ful, he found the exerci&s;e very ea&s;y, and he thought there was little more expected from him.</P>
<P>He &s;oon began to flouri&s;h away in his talk; and when he met with any one of his old fellow-&s;ervants, he fell a prating about marches, and counter-marches, and blockades, and battles, and &s;ieges, and blood, and death, and triumphs, and victories, all at random; for the&s;e were words and phra&s;es he had picked up without at all under&s;tanding what he &s;aid. He had no knowledge, and therefore he had no mode&s;ty; he had no experience, and therefore he had no fears.</P>
<P>All &s;eemed to go on &s;wimmingly, for he had as yet no trial. He began to think with triumph what a mean life he had e&s;caped from in the old quarrel&s;ome family, and what a happy honorable life he &s;hould have in the army. <HI>O, there was no life like the life of a &s;oldier.</HI></P>
<P>In a &s;hort time, however, war broke out, his regi|ment was one of the fir&s;t which was called out to actual and hard &s;ervice. As William was the mo&s;t raw of all the recruits, he was the fir&s;t to murmur at the diffi|culties and hard&s;hips, the cold and hunger, the fatigue
<PB N="293" REF="035296_0387_1001C14307DC0620">and danger, of being a &s;oldier. O what watchings, and perils, and trials, and hard&s;hips, and difficulties, he now thought attended a military life! "Surely," &s;aid he, "I could never have &s;u&s;pected all this mi&s;ery, when I u&s;ed to &s;ee the men on the parade in our town."</P>
<P>He now found, when it was too late, that all the field-days he u&s;ed to attend, all the evolutions and exer|ci&s;es which he had ob&s;erved the &s;oldiers to go through in the calm times of peace and &s;afety, were only meant to fit, train, and qualify them, for the actual &s;ervice which they were now &s;ent out to perform by the command of the <HI>King.</HI></P>
<P>The truth is, William often complained when there was no real hard&s;hip to complain of; for the common troubles of life fell out pretty much alike to the <HI>great family</HI> which William had le&s;t, and to the &s;oldiers in the <HI>King's army.</HI> But the &s;pirit of obedience, di&s;cipline, and &s;elf-denial of the latter, &s;eemed hard&s;hips to one of William's loo&s;e turn of mind. When he began to murmur, &s;ome good old &s;oldier clapped him on the back, &s;aying, "cheer up lad, it is a kingdom you are to &s;trive for; if we faint not, henceforth there is laid up for us a great reward, we have the <HI>King's</HI> word for it man."&mdash;William ob&s;erved that to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> who truly believed this, their labors were as nothing, but he him&s;elf did not at the bottom believe it; and it was ob&s;erved of all the &s;oldiers who failed, the true cau&s;e was that they did not really believe the <HI>King's</HI> promi&s;e. He was &s;urprized to &s;ee the then &s;oldiers, who u&s;ed to blu&s;ter, and boa&s;t, and deride the a&s;&s;aults of the enemy, now began to fall away; while &s;uch as had faithfully obeyed the <HI>King's</HI> orders, and believed in his word, were &s;u&s;tained in the hour of trial. Tho&s;e who had tru&s;ted in their own &s;trength, all fainted in the &s;lighte&s;t attack, while tho&s;e who had put on the armour of the <HI>King's</HI> providing, <HI>the &s;word,</HI> and <HI>the &s;hield,</HI> and <HI>the helmet,</HI> and <HI>the brea&s;t|plate,</HI> and who&s;e <HI>feet were &s;hod</HI> according to order, now
<PB N="294" REF="035296_0388_1001C14B96841D48">endured hard&s;hips as good &s;oldiers, and were enabled to <HI>fight the good fight.</HI></P>
<P>An engagement was expected immediately. The men were ordered to prepare for battle. While the re&s;t of the corps were &s;o preparing, William's whole thoughts were bent on contriving how he might de&s;ert. But, alas! he was watched on all &s;ides, he could not po&s;&s;ibly devi&s;e any means to e&s;cape. The danger increa&s;ed eve|ry moment&mdash;the battle came on. William, who had been &s;o &s;ure and confident before he entered, flinched in the moment of trial; while his more quiet and le&s;s boa&s;t|ful comrades, prepared boldly to do their duty. William looked about on all &s;ides, and &s;aw that there was no eye upon him, for he did not know that the <HI>King's</HI> eye was every where at once. He at la&s;t thought he &s;pied a chance of e&s;caping, not from the enemy, but from his own army. While he was endeavoring to e&s;cape, a ball from the oppo&s;ite camp took off his leg. As he &s;ell, the fir&s;t words which broke from him were, "while I was in duty I was pre&s;erved, in the very act of de&s;ert|ing I am wounded." He lay expecting every moment to be trampled to death, but as &s;oon as the confu&s;ion was a little over, he was taken off the field by &s;ome of his own party, laid in a plac<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;afety, and left to him&s;elf, after his wound was dre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters"></P>
<P>The &s;kirmi&s;h, for it proved nothing more, was &s;oon over. The greater part of the regiment e&s;caped in &s;afety, while the few who fell, rejoiced that they fell in their duty. William in the mean time &s;uffered cruelly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">oth in mind and body. To the pains of a wounded <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ldier, he added the di&s;grace of a coward, and the infa|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y of a de&s;erter. "O," cried he, "why was I &s;uch a fool as to leave the <HI>great family</HI> I lived in, where there was meat and drink enough and to &s;pare, only on ac|count of a little quarrel? I might have made up that with them as we had done our former quarrels. Why did I leave a life of ea&s;e and plea&s;ure, where I had only
<PB N="295" REF="035296_0389_1001C150A4A84ED0">a little rub now and then, for a life of daily di&s;cipline, and con&s;tant danger? Why did I turn &s;oldier? O, what a mi&s;erable animal is a &s;oldier!"</P>
<P>As he was &s;itting in this weak and di&s;abled condition, uttering the above complaints, he ob&s;erved a venerable old officer, with thin grey locks on his head, and on his face deep wrinkles engraved by time, and many an ho|ne&s;t &s;car inflicted by war&punc; William had heard this old officer highly commended for his extraordinary courage and conduct in battle, and in peace he u&s;ed to &s;ee him cool and collected, devoutly employed in reading and praying, in the interval of more active duties. He could not help comparing this officer with him&s;elf. "I," &s;aid he, "flinched and drew-back, and would even have de|&s;erted in the moment of peril; and now, in return, I have no con&s;olation in the hour of repo&s;e and &s;afety. I would not fight then, I cannot pray now. O, why would I ever think of being a &s;oldier?" He then began afre&s;h to weep and lament, and he groaned &s;o loud that he drew the notice of the officer, who came up to him, kindly &s;at down by him, took him by the hand, and enquired with as much affection as if he had been his brother, what was the matter with him, and what particular dis|tre&s;s, more than the common fortune of war, it was which drew from him &s;uch bitter groans? "I know &s;ome|thing of &s;urgery," added he, "let me examine your wound, and a&s;&s;i&s;t you with &s;uch little comforts as I can."</P>
<P>William at once &s;aw the difference between the &s;ol|diers in the <HI>King's</HI> army, and the people in the <HI>great family;</HI> the latter commonly withdrew their kindne&s;s in &s;ickne&s;s and trouble, when mo&s;t wanted, which was ju&s;t the very time when the others came forward to as|&s;i&s;t. He told the officer his little hi&s;tory, the manner of his living in the <HI>great family,</HI> the trifling cau&s;e of his quarrelling with it, the &s;light ground of his entering into the <HI>King's</HI> &s;ervice. "Sir," &s;aid he, "I quarrelled with the family, and I thought I was at once fit for the
<PB N="296" REF="035296_0390_1001C154F4076D70">army: I did not know the qualifications it required.&mdash;I had not reckoned on di&s;cipline, and hard&s;hips, and &s;elf-denial. I liked well enough to &s;ing a loyal &s;ong, or drink the King's health, but I find I do not reli&s;h work|ing and fighting for him, though I ra&s;hly premi&s;ed even to lay down my life for his &s;ervice if called upon, when I took the bounty money and the oath of allegiance.&mdash;In &s;hort, Sir, I find that I long for the ea&s;e and &s;loth, the merriment and the fea&s;ting, of my old &s;ervice; I find I cannot be a &s;oldier, and, to &s;peak truth, I was in the very act of de&s;erting, when I was &s;topped &s;hort by the cannon ball. So that I feel the guilt of de&s;erting, and the mi&s;ery of having lo&s;t my leg into the bargain."</P>
<P>The officer thus replied, "your &s;tate is that of every worldly irreligious man. The <HI>great family</HI> you &s;erved is a ju&s;t picture of the WORLD. The wages the world promi&s;es to tho&s;e who are willing to do its work, are high, but the payment is attended with much di&s;appoint|ment; nay, the world, like your great family, is in it|&s;elf in&s;olvent, and in its very nature incapable of making good the promi&s;es, and of paying the high rewards which it holds out to tempt its credulous followers. The un|godly world, like your family, cares little for church, and &s;till le&s;s for prayers; and con&s;iders the bible rather as an in&s;trument to make an oath binding, in order to keep the vulgar in obedience, than as containing in it|&s;elf a perfect rule of faith and practice, and as a title-deed to heaven. The generality of men love the world as you did your &s;ervice, while it &s;miles upon them, and gives them ea&s;y work, and plenty of meat and drink; but as &s;oon as it begins to cro&s;s and contradict them, they get out of humour with it, ju&s;t as you did with your &s;ervice. They then think its drudgery hard, its rewards low. They find out that it is high in its ex|pectations from them, and &s;lack in its payments to them. And they begin to fancy (becau&s;e they do not hear re|ligious people murmur as they do) that there mu&s;t be

The world, which takes no account of their deeper &s;ins, at length brings them into di&s;credit for &s;ome act of imprudence, ju&s;t as your family overlooked your lying and &s;wearing, but threatened to drub you for breaking a china di&s;h; &s;uch is the judg|ment of the world, it particularly bears with tho&s;e who only break the laws of God, but &s;everely puni&s;hes the &s;malle&s;t negligence by which property is injured. The world &s;ooner pardons the breaking ten commandments of God, than even a china di&s;h of its own.</P>
<P>"After &s;ome cro&s;s or oppo&s;ition, worldly men, as I &s;aid before, begin to think how much content and cheerful|ne&s;s they remember to have &s;een in religious people.&mdash;They therefore begin to fancy that religion mu&s;t be an ea&s;y and delightful as well as a good thing. They have heard that <HI>her ways are ways of plea&s;antne&s;s, and all her paths are peace;</HI> and they per&s;uade them&s;elves that by this is meant worldly plea&s;antne&s;s and &s;en&s;ual peace. They re&s;olve at length to try it, to turn their back up|on the world, to engage in the &s;ervice of God and turn chri&s;tians; ju&s;t as you re&s;olved to leave your old &s;er|vice, to enter into the &s;ervice of the King and turn &s;ol|dier. But as you quitted your place in a pa&s;&s;ion, &s;o they leave the world in a huff. They do not count the co&s;t. They do not calculate upon the darling &s;ins, the habitual plea&s;ures, the ea&s;e and vanities, which they un|dertake by their new engagements to renounce, any more than you counted what indulgencies you were go|ing to give up, when you quitted the luxuries and idle|ne&s;s of your place to enli&s;t in the &s;oldier's warfare.&mdash;They have, as I &s;aid, &s;een chri&s;tians cheerful, and they mi&s;took the ground of their cheerfulne&s;s; they fancied it aro&s;e, not becau&s;e through grace they had conquered difficulties, but becau&s;e they had no difficulties in their pa&s;&s;age. They fancied that religion found the road &s;mooth, whereas it only helps to bear with a rough road without complaint. They do not know that the&s;e chris|tians
<PB N="298" REF="035296_0392_1001C161DD1CBE58">are of good cheer, not becau&s;e the world is free from tribulation, but becau&s;e Chri&s;t, their captain, has <HI>overcome the world.</HI> But the irreligious man, who has only &s;een the out&s;ide of a chri&s;tian in his worldly inter|cour&s;e, knows little of his &s;ecret conflicts, his trials, his &s;elf-denials, his warfare with the world without, and with his own corrupt de&s;ires within.</P>
<P>The irreligious man quarrels with the world, on &s;ome &s;uch occa&s;ion as you did with your place. He now puts on the outward forms and ceremonies of religion, and a&s;&s;umes the badges of chi&s;tianity, ju&s;t as you were &s;truck with the &s;hows of a field day; ju&s;t as you were plea&s;ed with the mu&s;ic and the marching, and put on the cock|ade and the red coat. All &s;eems &s;mooth for a little while. He goes through the outward exerci&s;es of a chri&s;tian, a degree of credit attends his new profe&s;&s;ion, but he never &s;u&s;pects there is either difficulty or di&s;cipline attending it; he fancies religion is a thing for talking about, and not a thing of the heart and the life. He never &s;u&s;pects that all the p&s;alm-&s;inging he joins in, and the &s;ermons he hears, and the other means he is u&s;ing, are only as the exerci&s;es and the evolutions of the &s;oldiers, to fit and prepare him for actual &s;ervice; and that the&s;e means are no more religion it&s;elf, than the exerci&s;es and evo|lutions of your parade were real warfare.</P>
<P>At length &s;ome trial ari&s;es. This nominal chri&s;tian is called to differ from the world in &s;ome great point; &s;omething happens which may &s;trike at his comfort, or his credit, or &s;ecurity. This cools his zeal for religion, ju&s;t as the view of an engagement cooled your courage as a &s;oldier. He finds he was only angry with the world, he was not tired of it. He was out of humor with the world, not becau&s;e he had &s;een through its vanity and emptine&s;s, but becau&s;e the world was out of humor with him. He finds that it is an ea&s;y thing to be a fair weather chri&s;tian, bold where there is nothing to be done, and confident where there is nothing to be fear|ed

<P>EVER &s;ince &s;in entered into the world and death by &s;in, this earth has been a va&s;t grave-yard, or burying place for her children. In every age, and in every country, that &s;entence has been executing, <HI>Du&s;t thou art, and unto du&s;t thou &s;halt return.</HI> Mankind at fir&s;t con&s;i&s;ted only of one pair, but how inconceiva|bly numerous are now the &s;ons of Adam!

How many, then, mu&s;t be the millions that have appeared on the earth in the long run of near &s;ix thou&s;and years!&mdash;Let imagination cal lup this va&s;t army; infants that have ju&s;t lived to &s;ee the light, multitudes of the young and middle aged, and all the old and grey-headed al&s;o&mdash;per&s;ons of all countries and of &s;ucce&s;&s;ive generations&mdash;let them all pa&s;s in review before us, and now va&s;t and a&s;toni&s;hing is the multitude! If the po&s;terity of one man, Abraham, by one of his &s;ons was, according to the language of divine promi&s;e, <HI>as the &s;tars of heaven and as the &s;and by the &s;ea-&s;hore, innumerable,</HI> who can compute the multitudes that have &s;prung from all the different patriarchs? Who can number the long line of children that have proceeded from Adam, and all the fa|milies of the earth that have &s;prung from the loins of Noah! But what is now become of this va&s;t and in|conceivable
<PB N="301" REF="035296_0395_1001C36B368C7658">ho&s;t?

There has hardly, perhaps, been one moment of time, during the &s;pace of many thou&s;and years, in which one per&s;on or other has not been dropping into the grave: and in &s;ome &s;ea&s;ons, through the &s;word of war, the devouring pe&s;tilence, or rather vi&s;itations of God, thou&s;ands have been mowed down at once, and have formed one undi&s;tingui&s;hed heap of dead. The greater part of mankind beyond compari&s;on, are now &s;leeping under ground. There lies beauty, mouldering into du&s;t, a prey to the vile&s;t worms; there lies the mean and humble beggar; and there lies the head that once wore a crown. There lie the mighty giants, the Samp&s;ons, and the Cae&s;ars of the world. There lie the wi&s;e and the learned, as weak and helple&s;s as the fool. There lie &s;ome with whom we our&s;elves have conver&s;ed, and who were once our dear friends and our companions; and there lie our fathers and mothers; and there perhaps al&s;o lies a ten|der wife or hu&s;band, a child, a &s;i&s;ter, or a brother.</P>
<P>And &s;hall they lie there always? Shall this body, that curious worman&s;hip of God, <HI>&s;o fearfully and wonder|fully made,</HI> continue always in the&s;e ruins, and &s;hall it never be re&s;tored?

But what has he declared to be his intention in this ca&s;e? for on this the matter turns; and it is a point which is fully revealed in the Scriptures. <HI>The hour is coming,</HI> &s;ays that &s;acred book, <HI>when all that are in the grave &s;hall hear the voice of the Son of Man, and &s;hall come forth; they that have done well, to the re&s;urrec|tion of life; and they that have done evil, to the re&s;ur|rection

<P>Let us now realize the maje&s;ty and terror of this tre|mendous day.

This call will be as effectual in rai&s;ing each of the &s;ons of men as ever that call of Chri&s;t was, <HI>Lazarus, come forth.</HI> O, what a &s;urpri&s;e will it be to the thoughtle&s;s world! Should this alarm bur&s;t over our heads this moment, with what terror would it &s;trike many a one who read this de&s;cription of it? How dreadful, then, will be the &s;urpri&s;e and con|&s;ternation when this event &s;hall actually come to pa&s;s!

<P>But for what purpo&s;e &s;hall they ri&s;e?

And the&s;e &s;hall go away into everla&s;ting puni&s;hment, and the righteous into life eternal. And I &s;aw,</HI> &s;ays the apo&s;tle, <HI>the dead, &s;mall and great &s;tand before God; and the books were open|ed, and the dead were judged out of tho&s;e things which were written in the books according to their works; and the &s;ea gave up the dead that were in it, and death and hell</HI> (that is the place of departed &s;pirits) <HI>delivered up the dead which were in them, and they were judged every man according to their works, and who&s;oever was not found written in the book of life was ca&s;t into the lake of fire. And I &s;aw,</HI> continues the &s;ame apo&s;tle, <HI>a new heaven and a new earth, for the fir&s;t heaven and the fir&s;t earth were pa&s;&s;ed away. And I heard a great voice out of heaven, &s;aying, behold the Tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and
<PB N="304" REF="035296_0398_1001C373E2F28880">there &s;hall be no more death, nor &s;orrow, nor crying, for the former things are pa&s;&s;ed away. And he that &s;at on the throne &s;aid, behold, I make all things new.</HI> In like manner we are told in another place, that <HI>the heavens and the earth are but kept in &s;tore until the day of de&s;truction and perdition of ungodly men;</HI> and that when this <HI>great and terrible day of the Lord</HI> &s;hall come, then <HI>the very elements &s;hall melt with &s;ervent heat&mdash;the earth al&s;o, and all the works thereof &s;hall be burnt up&mdash;the heavens &s;hall depart as a &s;croll&mdash;they all &s;hall wax old as doth a garment, and as a ve&s;ture &s;hall be changed;</HI> and there &s;hall then he <HI>new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteou&s;ne&s;s.</HI> Well might the apo&s;tle &s;ay, <HI>Seeing then that all the&s;e things &s;hall be di&s;&s;olved, what manner of per&s;ons ought we to be in all holy conver&s;ation and godline&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>There are many things &s;poken of in Scripture that &s;hall follow the grand &s;cene of the re&s;urrection, which remain to be de&s;cribed; but we &s;hall &s;peak in this place only of one further point, and that is of the per&s;on who is to be our judge. It will be Je&s;us Chri&s;t, <HI>for the Father,</HI> &s;ays the Scripture, <HI>judgeth no man, for God hath committed all judgment to the Son, becau&s;e he is the Son of Man. This &s;ame Je&s;us,</HI> &s;aid the angels, ju&s;t after his re&s;urrection, <HI>which is taken up from you into heaven, &s;hall &s;o come in like manner as ye have &s;een him go into heaven.</HI> Once he was <HI>de&s;pi&s;ed and rejected of men; he was led as a lamb to the &s;laughter, and as a &s;heep before his &s;hearers is dumb, &s;o he opened not his mouth;</HI> he was <HI>mocked, and buffeted, and &s;pit upon;</HI> he was him&s;elf arraigned before the bar of Pontius Pi|late, and he was hung upon the Cro&s;s as if he was the vile&s;t malefactor, the whole multitude having joined in the cry, crucify him, crucify him.

<P>There are other per&s;ons who oblige them&s;elves daily to &s;ay over the Lord's prayer only, and perhaps al&s;o the belief. This is often done in a very formal and &s;uper|&s;titious manner. The Lord's prayer is undoubtedly a mo&s;t excellent pattern for our daily prayers, but it does not appear to have been given by Chri&s;t as the only form of prayer that was to be u&s;ed; and it is worthy of remark that when he uttered it, he took occa&s;ion to warn his di&s;ciples again&s;t the vain repetitions u&s;ed in prayer by the Phari&s;ees. It is to be feared that even the Lord's prayer has become a vain repetition in the&s;e days, not through any fault in the prayer it&s;elf, but through the unthinking, and perhaps, over frequent way in which &s;ome people u&s;e it.

The ma&s;ter of a family (or the mi&s;tre&s;s in his ab&s;ence) by devoutly reading a morning and eve|ning prayer to his family, in&s;tructs both his children and &s;ervants in their duty, accu&s;toms them to prayer, makes an open profe&s;&s;ion of his own religion, brings him&s;elf under an obligation to ob&s;erve a con&s;i&s;tent, that is, a religious conduct during the day; and above all let it be remarked, he draws down the ble&s;&s;ing of God on him&s;elf and his hou&s;ehold. Four prayers are here offered to ma&s;ters and mi&s;tre&s;&s;es of families, and they who have not yet been u&s;ed to family prayer, have now therefore, an opportunity of beginning this good cus|tom, and in doing it may God grant them his bles|&s;ing!</P>

<HEAD>General Directions, appli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">le chiefly to the ca&s;e of private Prayer.</HEAD>
<P>Fir&s;t, before you proceed to your private prayers, endeavor to compo&s;e your thoughts, and then ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters">e your&s;elf for a few moments. A&s;k your&s;elf in the morn|ing, for in&s;tance, what are likely to be the duties and trials of the day that is before you, and in the evening reflect what have been the &s;ins of the day pa&s;t. By do|ing &s;o, you will be enabled to apply the words of your prayer more particularly to your own ca&s;e, and po&s;&s;i|bly al&s;o you may thus be led to add a few words of your own to what you have got by heart, and by degrees you may thus be inclined to enlarge your daily petition more and more in your own words, and thus you may learn to pray in &s;pirit and in truth.</P>
<P>Secondly, when about to pray, endeavor to lift up your heart to God for the help of his Holy Spirit; for the Scripture t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">lls us, that it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>the H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> Spirit that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters">th our infir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">rities,</HI> Many p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">op<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e comp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ain or great
<PB N="309" REF="035296_0403_1001C37E08C51E00">coldne&s;s and indifference while engaged in prayer, and there are few who are not con&s;cious of this in a great|er or le&s;s degree. Let all them begin, by imploring God's Holy Spirit to a&s;&s;i&s;t them in praying as they ought. There cannot be a better introduction to every kind of prayer, than a few &s;ecret words fir&s;t uttered to this effect from the heart.</P>
<P>Thirdly, beware of wandering thoughts when enga|ged in prayer. To this end let every &s;truggle be made, and let it be &s;eriou&s;ly impre&s;&s;ed upon you, that God is now pre&s;ent in an e&s;pecial manner, and that all ab&s;ence of mind which is allowed and indulged is a great affront to his maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>Fourthly, but be&s;ides being attentive, take care that you are al&s;o &s;incere in your prayer. A&s;k your&s;elf often whether you mean what you &s;ay while you are praying and whether you &s;incerely and earne&s;tly wi&s;h the thing that you a&s;k. Accu&s;tom your&s;elf not to attend to the mere &s;ound of your words, but to the &s;en&s;e; and if you do not well under&s;tand any part of the prayers here of|fered you, endeavor to get what is difficult explained before you repeat it. Some per&s;ons have been known to &s;ay prayers day by day, almo&s;t every word of which they have contradicted by their whole conver&s;ation and conduct. What a terrible hypocri&s;y is this! A man's prayers may either be the greate&s;t ble&s;&s;ing to him or the mo&s;t grievous &s;in, according to the manner in which he performs them.</P>
<P>Fifthly, endeavor not only to be &s;incere in your prayers at the moment when you offer them, but en|deavor al&s;o, that the &s;ame &s;pirit which animates your prayers, may animate your whole life. To this end, examine your life often by means of your prayers. Try whether all your maxims in life, your common &s;peech, and your &s;everal tempers, as well as your open conduct agree with the prayers which you u&s;e. The &s;incerity which God requires of you is not a momentary &s;ince|rity,
<PB N="310" REF="035296_0404_1001C382F94DFBA0">it is not a &s;hort lived and changeable feeling which is forgotten when you go into the world. The remem|brance of what you have been praying for in the morn|ing &s;hould follow you into the field or the &s;hop, and &s;hould influence your conduct all the day long.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, con&s;ider whether God an&s;wers your pray|ers. If you pray aright, depend upon it your prayers will be heard and an&s;wered; your tempers will be &s;ub|dued, your temptations weakened, and your whole mind will be rendered pious if you really pray that it may be &s;o; and if this be not the ca&s;e, you may rea&s;ona|bly &s;u&s;pect that your prayers have not been &s;uch as they ought. If you pray aright, depend upon it, you will improve in every re&s;pect; you will gain more humili|ty, more tenderne&s;s of con&s;cience, more fear of God, more plea&s;ure in his wor&s;hip, and more happine&s;s in his &s;ervice, and al&s;o more confidence in Chri&s;t, and probably more hope of &s;alvation in proportion to the earne&s;tne&s;s and &s;incerity of your prayers to God to this effect, for the&s;e are all the gifts of that holy &s;pirit which God hath promi&s;ed to them that a&s;k it.</P>

<P>O Lord God Almighty, who ha&s;t &s;afely brought us to the beginning of this day, we thank thee for thy merciful pre&s;ervation of us through the pa&s;t night.&mdash;We al&s;o thank thee for all thy goodne&s;s to us, for our health and &s;trength, and food and raiment, and friends and benefactors.

<P>We further be&s;eech thee to ble&s;s all our relations, friends, and connections; take both them and us un|der thy protection this night.

<P>O Lord God Almighty, Father of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, we ble&s;s thy name for all thy mercies vouch&s;af|ed unto us the children of men.</P>
<P>We thank thee, O Lord, for all the ble&s;&s;ings of this life, but e&s;pecially we prai&s;e thee for giving us thy ho|ly word, for &s;ending to us the mini&s;ters of thy go&s;pel, and for appointing the Sabbath to be a &s;ea&s;on of re&s;t for our bodies, and to be a day on which we may al&s;o at|tend to the &s;alvation of our immortal &s;ouls.</P>
<P>O Lord, grant we be&s;eech thee, that we may right|ly u&s;e the religious opportunities which we enjoy.&mdash;Pre&s;erve us from thoughtle&s;&s;ne&s;s and inattention dur|ing thy public wor&s;hip. In prayer may we feel our need of the mercies we implore. In the confe&s;&s;ion of &s;in, may we be affected with the &s;en&s;e of our unworthi|ne&s;s, and in offering up thank&s;givings to God, may we pour out our whole hearts before thee. We pray al&s;o, that when we &s;hall hear thy word read, and the go&s;pel of Je&s;us Chri&s;t preached to us, we may li&s;ten with an attentive ear, and receive thy truth into an hone&s;t and good heart.</P>
<P><PB N="321" REF="035296_0415_1001C35F89CE3548">
And we be&s;eech thee to pre&s;erve in us a right frame of mind throughout the day that is now before us.&mdash;May we remember that this is the day on which our Saviour ro&s;e from the dead, having by his death ob|tained eternal redemption for us. May we therefore think of our a&s;cended Lord, and may we put away from us all folly and vanity, as well as vice and wickedne&s;s, and all eager de&s;ires after the things of this life, and all anger and pa&s;&s;ion, and envy, and malice, and what&s;oe|ver el&s;e is either un&s;uitable to this &s;acred day, or is un|becoming the followers of Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>O Lord, we lament that in pa&s;&s;ing through the week we are &s;o often entangled by the cares of this life, and overpowered by temptations which come upon us un|awares. But we pray thee now to call away our tho'ts from earthly things, and to fix them on tho&s;e un&s;peak|able joys which are at thy right hand for evermore.&mdash;We pray thee on this day to &s;trengthen our faith, to encrea&s;e our hope, and to fill our hearts with love to thee, and with fervent charity towards our neighbor. Help us al&s;o to repent of our &s;ins, examining carefully our conduct during the week, and thus may we learn to amend our lives, and to run with patience the race that is &s;et before us.</P>
<P>And, together with the&s;e prayers for our&s;elves, we offer up our &s;upplications in behalf of all chri&s;tian con|gregations. Give thy grace to all the mini&s;ters of thy go&s;pel, and enable them every where this day to preach thy word with faithfulne&s;s to the &s;ouls of men. Make thy go&s;pel effectual, to pull down the pride of the high minded, to alarm the carele&s;s, and convince the waver|ing, to encourage them that are as yet weak in faith, and to give peace and con&s;olation to every troubled heart.</P>
<P>And, O Lord, we be&s;eech thee, to &s;end thy go&s;pel to the nations which now &s;it in darkne&s;s. Put an end to all fal&s;e religion, and idolatry, and ignorance, and

<P>We offer up the&s;e our prayers, in the name of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, our only Lord and Saviour.</P>

<HEAD>Prayer for a Family on Sunday Evening.</HEAD>
<P>O Lord God Almighty, Father of Mercies we be|&s;eech thee, for Chri&s;t's &s;ake, to hear the prayers which we are now about to offer up unto thee.</P>
<P>We pray thee, O Lord, to give thy ble&s;&s;ing to the in&s;truction which we have this day heard, and to grant that it may be &s;o grafted inwardly in all our hearts, as to bring forth in us the fruits of good living, to the prai&s;e and glory of thy name. Pardon al&s;o what&s;oever thou ha&s;t &s;een ami&s;s in our wor&s;hip and &s;ervices on this day.</P>
<P>And accept, O Lord, our humble confe&s;&s;ion of all tho&s;e great and manifold &s;ins, which, from time to time both in thought, word, and deed, we have committed again&s;t thee: for we have left undone tho&s;e things which we ought to have done, and we have done tho&s;e things which we ought not to have done, and there is no health in us. We have &s;inned, O Lord, by our pride and vanity, by our indulgence of many &s;inful pa&s;&s;ions, by our fretfulne&s;s, impatience, and di&s;content, by our e|mulation, our ambition, and our covetou&s;ne&s;s. We have &s;inned al&s;o by our &s;loth and negligence, by our forgetfulne&s;s of many duties of our calling, by our too great love of this pre&s;ent world, and by our carele&s;sne&s;s in following many of tho&s;e evil customs which we have found in it. More e&s;pecially we have &s;inned by our inattention to thy written word, to thy preached go&s;pel and to all the means of thy grace.</P>
<P>For the&s;e, and all our numberle&s;s offences, we here
<PB N="323" REF="035296_0417_1001A4332DEBF370">implore thy pardon and forgivene&s;s, in the name of Je|&s;us Chri&s;t; at the &s;ame time we thank thee for &s;o mer|cifully providing the Saviour for us, who came down from heaven and died for our &s;ins, and who now &s;itteth at thy right hand making interce&s;&s;ion for us.</P>
<P>We al&s;o be&s;eech thee, for Chri&s;t's &s;ake, to grant unto us the help of thy holy &s;pirit, that we may now for&s;ake every evil way, and may amend our lives according to thy holy word. O Lord, pre&s;erve us through the en|&s;uing week from &s;inning again&s;t thee. Save us from the world, the fle&s;h, and the devil. Carry us through all our temptations and dangers. Fit us for what&s;oever duties are before us, and when we have fulfilled thy will on earth, receive us to thine eternal kingdom, through Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>And the &s;ame things which we have been imploring for our&s;elves, we humbly a&s;k in behalf of our dear friends and relations. Grant unto them pardon of their &s;ins, an humble faith in Je&s;us Chri&s;t their Lord, and grace to walk in the way of thy commandments. Be merciful to the land in which we live. Ble&s;s our king and all in authority. Give thine e&s;pecial grace to the mini&s;ters of thy go&s;pel, that they may both preach thy true and lively word, and may al&s;o be examples to their flock of all virtue and goodne&s;s. Let thy ble&s;&s;ing al&s;o de&s;cend on all the faithful followers of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. Save them from the temptations which are in the world: &s;trengthen their faith and hope, and unite them in the bonds of chri&s;tian charity with each other; and have pity on all tho&s;e who neglect thy go&s;pel, and profane thy Sabbaths, and live as if there was no God in the world. Convince them of their &s;ins before it is too late, and incline them to &s;eek for mercy, through that Saviour who&s;e grace they now de&s;pi&s;e. And O Lord, deliver every one of us from all hardne&s;s of heart and contempt of thy word and commandments. Make us to lie down this night thankfull for the opportunities of
<PB N="324" REF="035296_0418_1001C3665B848288">in&s;truction which we have enjoyed, and for all the bles|&s;ings of the go&s;pel. And may the peace of God, which pa&s;&s;eth all under&s;tanding, keep our hearts and minds in the knowledge and fear of God, and of his Son Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</P>
