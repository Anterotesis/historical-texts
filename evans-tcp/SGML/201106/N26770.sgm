<P>THE following Pro&s;pectus in|culdes that cour&s;e, and tho&s;e principles, to which I have adhered, with as much inflexi|bility as the nature of my cla&s;s, and the wi&s;h|es of parents would permit. I have formed no hypothe&s;is; I have hazarded no conjecture. Long reflection on the nature, de&s;tination and happine&s;s of man, matured by the influence of experience, has affixed to it, with me, its &s;eal of <HI>&s;low</HI> approbation. I now &s;ubmit it to the examination of parents in general, as a map of that country, through which both pupil and preceptor mu&s;t travel together, to the temple of u&s;eful knowledge. In paths diver|&s;ified like the&s;e, I &s;hall continue to walk, &s;o long as the intere&s;ts of my ri&s;ing offspring &s;hall ju&s;tify my per&s;everence. The period of the contract I made expre&s;sly with &s;ome of you, and virtually with all, on my arrival in this city, being expired, I &s;hall not lo&s;e this opportunity of ob&s;erving, that your &s;trict punctuality is entitled to the public avowal of my gratitude

<P>WERE I a&s;ked what principle in human power was calculated to produce the greate&s;t effects on the dignity, u&s;efulne&s;s and happine&s;s of man, I &s;hould an&s;wer&mdash;<HI>EDUCATION.</HI></P>
<P>Happily, we live in the clo&s;e of a century, in which its in|fluence is no longer a problem &s;eeking for &s;olution, but an axiom that commands a&s;&s;ent&mdash;Man has not lived in vain&mdash;Millions of <HI>individuals</HI> are rendered invi&s;ible by the &s;hades of death, but the hi&s;tory of the <HI>&s;pecies</HI> has given energy and duration to the mo&s;t momentous truths. The progre&s;s of nations has marked the pow|er of education in characters which challenge time to obliterate: but it is the prerogative of civilization to appreciate its value. "Knowledge," &s;ays Bacon, "is power;" and it belongs to the century who&s;e twilight now &s;kirts our horizon, to convert this knowledge to the <HI>amelioration of the &s;pecies.</HI> We have the in|&s;trument within our gra&s;p: dark, di&s;&s;olute and guilty, will be that nation that has not virtue to u&s;e it. It is no longer nece&s;|&s;ary for the man of reflection to enquire what conferred on Athens and on Rome its ancient celebrity? what gave duration to the &s;tate of Sparta? what di&s;tingui&s;hed Egypt for its litera|ture and its &s;cience, when Greece and Rome ranked with bar|barians?
<PB N="10" REF="035626_0007_100611432B6E7820">why has the &s;un &s;et &s;o long on Africa and the Ea&s;t? what con&s;titutes the difference between England in the days of Cae&s;ar, and at the clo&s;e of the eighteenth century? Had New|ton pa&s;&s;ed his days in the country of the Hottentots, or Locke vegetated in the wigwams of the natives of this continent, what a tremendous cha&s;m would have appeared in the pyramids of phy&s;ical and moral &s;cience! The di&s;tinction which annihilates all others between the &s;ame nation at different periods, and different nations at the &s;ame period; between different in|dividuals of the &s;ame community, and the &s;ame per&s;on at dif|ferent times,&mdash;is <HI>Cultivation:</HI> but who does not perceive that this keeps pace with education?&mdash;is accelerated by it, or re|tarded by the want of it? De&s;titute of a liberal education, how &s;hall our youth move with dignity where &s;cenes of u&s;efulne&s;s open?&mdash;how, where education alone qualifies?&mdash;how, where education alone is re&s;pected?&mdash;how fill the offices of a republi|can government, or take that lead in the active departments of life which manly &s;en&s;e, poli&s;hed by culture, and dignified by integrity, is alone entitled to? Can hone&s;ty of intention, how|ever honourable, compen&s;ate for the errors of incapacity? What but the advantages of education can prevent the gloomy irk&s;ome|ne&s;s ru&s;tic &s;olitude, or the fruitle&s;s wi&s;hes of advancing decre|pitude?&mdash;But I arre&s;t my pen. All civilized nations now perceive its influence; all ranks de&s;ire to &s;ecure its advantages; and no man forms an exception to this ob&s;ervation, but he who is a &s;lave to the mo&s;t puerile inattention, or fallen into the &s;tupor of gro&s;s depravity.</P>
<P>The man of property is compelled to regard it as a mine of exhau&s;tle&s;s value; and the creature of a title feels that <HI>without</HI> it he is a phantom in creation! The numbers of Horace, the phi|lo&s;ophy of Ari&s;totle, and the code of Lycurgus harmonize here. I rejoice that the citizens of this and other republics join the chorus. The con&s;titutions of America favour a cour&s;e of lib|eral education&mdash;its legi&s;latures encourage it: and while the fatigued &s;pirit of a Wa&s;hington roares from the theatre of pub|lic action, exclaiming with Horace,
<Q>"Quid leges &s;ine moribus vanoe proficiunt?"</Q>
Adams re-echoes in his inaugural oration,
<Q><L>"Doctrina &s;ed vim promovet in&s;itam</L>
<L>"Vectique cultus pectora voberant."</L>
<BIBL>HOR. Lib. Car. 4. Ode 4.</BIBL></Q>
Men like the&s;e know that education <HI>alone</HI> can &s;upply this re|public with citizens formed to <HI>&s;ubstdination.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="035626_0008_1005EDEBE6777150">
What then, it may be a&s;ked, is the <HI>end</HI> which education pro|po&s;es? I an&s;wer, to render our youth mo&s;t <HI>u&s;eful</HI> to them&s;elves, and to the &s;tate of which they are members; and by availing our&s;elves of the knowledge of the nature of man, to &s;ecure for them the greate&s;t quantity of happine&s;s in the mo&s;t expeditious manner. It is thus that education anticipates and avails it&s;elf of the &s;low fruits of experience; and &s;uch is its widely extend|ed influence, that the liberal in&s;truction of the rich will a&s;&s;ur|edly better the condition of the poor; while the education of the poorer ranks will, for the mo&s;t u&s;eful purpo&s;es, enable them to mea&s;ure foot&s;teps with the mo&s;t opulent.</P>
<P>As a mean to this end, education includes an attention to the health, the under&s;tanding, and the morals, It divides it&s;elf in|to three parts: 1. <HI>phy&s;ical;</HI> 2. <HI>moral;</HI> 3. <HI>intellectual.</HI> To conduct tuition therefore upon the large&s;t &s;cale, would require that a tutor &s;hould be attentive to the health, agility, addre&s;s, and activity of the body: that he &s;hould know and attend to the influence of the elements, nouri&s;hment, cloathing, lodg|ing, exerci&s;es, and pa&s;&s;ions: that he &s;hould accu&s;tom the &s;tu|dents to the various recreations of running, leaping, dancing, wre&s;tling, carrying burdens, playing at tennis, <HI>&amp;c. &amp;c.</HI> The <HI>moral</HI> part would require from him a regular training to the various per&s;onal and &s;ocial virtues. Beyond mere lectures on morality, the tutor &s;hould contrive &s;uch occa&s;ions as would bring every le&s;&s;on into action: a particular attention &s;hould be given to the biography of men in every &s;ituation of active life; and I will add, altho' gloomy &s;ceptici&s;m, wide-&s;preading infidel|ity, and de&s;olating profligacy, &s;hould arraign me at their bar, <HI>He &s;hould know how to impre&s;s his pupils with ju&s;t ideas of the moral character of the God of the univer&s;e, his government over all objects and events, and the exalted de&s;tiny of the whole human race.</HI> This, taught free from every thing extraneous, incidental, &s;ectarian or puerile, will furni&s;h &s;uch motives, excite &s;uch af|fections, impel to &s;uch actions, as will &s;ecure a love of <HI>ju&s;tice</HI> in the magi&s;trate, and of <HI>law</HI> in the citizen. From &s;uch principles, a &s;pirit of &s;ubordination will ari&s;e, &s;pontaneous as the fountain, diffu&s;ive as light, and harmonious as the &s;olar &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>To cultivate the under&s;tanding of young people, is the pre|ci&s;e object of a <HI>day-&s;chool.</HI> It is not po&s;&s;ible from the nature of &s;uch an in&s;titution, or any thing analagous to it, that a tutor &s;hould be able to give more than an indirect and &s;ubordinate atten|tion to either the health or morals of his pupils. The in&s;tant they leave the cla&s;s-room, all re&s;pon&s;ibility on the part of their tutor is at an end; they then enter under the &s;ole juri&s;diction of their pa|rents,
<PB N="12" REF="035626_0009_10061144B15374E8">and are amenable alone to them for any mi&s;conduct. To unite all the advantages of phy&s;ical, moral and intellectual educa|tion, would require that a tutor &s;hould be the companion of his cla&s;&s;es. This is done to the be&s;t effect in &s;mall &s;elect boarding &s;chools. When in England, I put my pupils under &s;uch regula|tions, as rendered it impo&s;&s;ible for them to lo&s;e much time. Hours of recreation were occupied in amu&s;ements conducive to health; and the internal police of the &s;eminary was regulated by a &s;mall code of laws, rendered effectual by corporal confinement, of longer or &s;horter duration.</P>
<P>That the minds of youth &s;hould be prepared for the future &s;cenes of active life, by a <HI>fixed cour&s;e of liberal education,</HI> is al|lowed and acted upon by all orders in &s;ociety. What branches &s;hall enter into this cour&s;e, has &s;uffered more or le&s;s fluctuation, according to the variations of opinion, the progre&s;s of ta&s;te, or the pre&s;&s;ure of nece&s;&s;ity. Hence the different degrees of atten|tion paid to certain arts, &s;ciences and languages, in the &s;ame or different ages. Milton publi&s;hed a cour&s;e of education in 1650: it appears to be for boys from the age of 12 to 20. His ideas on the order in which the branches of education &s;hould &s;ucceed each other, are founded on a ju&s;t theory of the mind. When he complains that "youth learned <HI>mere words, ragged notions and babblements,"</HI> does he not forcibly characteri&s;e the educa|tion of our expiring century? Gaillard, who publi&s;hed in 1678, particularly recommends the &s;tudy of logic, ethics, and lan|guages. A di&s;tingui&s;hed writer of the pre&s;ent day, who has been much employed in qualifying young gentlement for active life, branches his cour&s;e into the following articles: Religion, na|tural philo&s;ophy, natural hi&s;tory, agriculture, architecture, fortification, &s;cience of government, and navigation. Da|vid Williams, a &s;tar of no de&s;picable magnitude in the hemi|&s;phere of literature, and who about the year 1773, brought forward his plan of education, founded on that given by Come|nius, who was invited to England to reform its &s;chools, particu|larly recommends an attention to writing, drawing, the ma|thematics, logic, civil hi&s;tory, ethics, compo&s;ition, botany, natural hi&s;tory in general, and the Latin, Greek, and French languages.</P>
<P>Without enquiring why certain objects are enumerated in, or excluded from the above-cited cour&s;es, I &s;hall mark out &s;uch a one, as I hope will be found &s;uited to <HI>this age and country&mdash;com|prehen&s;ive, u&s;eful, practicable, and preparatory to either of the pro|fe&s;&s;ions, or any department of active life.</HI> As a parent deeply anxious to quality my <HI>own</HI> children for the chequered &s;cenes of
<PB N="13" REF="035626_0010_100611463A5862D8">life, I a&s;k my&s;elf, upon what <HI>principles</HI> ought their cour&s;e of education to be founded? Can I bear that an object of &s;uch known and mighty influence, &s;hould be left to the irregular caprice or undi&s;cerning prejudice of <HI>cu&s;tom?</HI>&mdash;that they &s;hould be merely fitted to move in the lower walks of life, and not rather to a&s;cend the more extended &s;pheres, if circum&s;tances invite them to it? Am I willing to &s;ub&s;titute the &s;howy for the &s;olid?&mdash; branches almo&s;t ob&s;olete, or who&s;e utility is confined and acci|dental, for &s;uch as I know the momentary occurrences of life call for?&mdash;&s;uch as can never become u&s;ele&s;s&mdash;&s;uch as will enable them to qualify them&s;elves for any department, that inclination, nece&s;&s;ity, the hand of friend&s;hip, pro&s;pect of reputation, hope of gain, or ardent love of public good, may ju&s;tify their pur&s;uing? Though it belongs not me, at this di&s;tance to know, or deter|mine their future &s;ituations, I will have them furni&s;hed with &s;uch materials as will &s;upport whatever &s;uper&s;tructure prudence &s;hall require hereafter to be rai&s;ed. In determining this que&s;tion of <HI>utility,</HI> I perceive that I ought to have them educated in tho&s;e branches which are mo&s;t frequently called into action; &s;uch as will facilitate their acquaintance with others, and be they me|chanics, trade&s;men, merchants, profe&s;&s;ional characters, or living in ea&s;y independence, their tutor &s;hall pre&s;ent them with &s;uch keys as will open any of the doors of &s;cience. With &s;uch re&s;o|lutions, ari&s;ing out of the mo&s;t precious cares of the heart, what are tho&s;e particular advantages I am eager to &s;ecure my offspring by entering them into a cour&s;e of education, who&s;e principles I have now determined on? I an&s;wer, that as I do not &s;end my &s;on to a &s;chool that he may forget the mo&s;t important years of his exi&s;tence, I propo&s;e to my&s;elf a &s;erious object.</P>
<P N="1">1. I wi&s;h as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible that he &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s a di&s;tinct articulation; an authorized pronunciation; a well-placed accent; a varied, but ju&s;t empha&s;is; a plea&s;ing modulation; a well-timed cadence, with every other attainment nece&s;&s;ary to the u&s;ual pur|po&s;es of <HI>reading</HI> or <HI>&s;peaking.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. That he &s;hould be capable of &s;electing and arranging his words in &s;uch a manner, as to avoid &s;oleci&s;ms, barbari&s;ms, ambiguities and vulgarities, with every other &s;pecies of <HI>gram|matical</HI> inaccuracy.</P>
<P N="3">3. That he &s;hould <HI>write</HI> our u&s;ual literal characters wit pro|portion, per&s;picuity and di&s;patch.</P>
<P N="4">4. That he &s;hould manage numbers with ca&s;e and correctne&s;s for the common purpo&s;es of civil life.</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="14" REF="035626_0011_10061148E4D0ED40">
5. That when he has occa&s;ion to record any thing, he &s;hould be capable of doing it with the greate&s;t po&s;&s;ible expedition.</P>
<P N="6">6. That he &s;hould be acquainted with the mo&s;t &s;triking facts of ancien: and modern <HI>hi&s;tory.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. That he &s;hould know the <HI>time</HI> when they happened.</P>
<P N="8">8. That he &s;hould know the <HI>place</HI> where they happened.</P>
<P N="9">9. That he &s;hould be able to rea&s;on on quantity, mea&s;ure, exten&s;ion; calculate on the&s;e with expedition; and thus be pre|pared to concentrate his attention with effect on a&s;tronomy, na|tural philo&s;ophy, architecture, &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P N="10">10. That he &s;hould come into life fitted to take a compre|hen&s;ive view of whatever may be the &s;ubject of his reflections; know how to avoid fal&s;e judgments and inconclu&s;ive rea&s;onings, and be able to methodize his thoughts for the purpo&s;es of &s;o|cial communication.</P>
<P N="11">11. That he &s;hould have his ta&s;te formed and refined by an acquaintance with the laws and kinds of &s;tyle; the &s;ources of in|vention; the u&s;es of figurative language; and be able to expre&s;s him&s;elf on any &s;ubject with ea&s;e, propriety and force.</P>
<P N="12">12. I wi&s;h him not to be ignorant of the de&s;ign of his moral powers; the mo&s;t frequent &s;prings of human actions, with their probable con&s;equences.</P>
<P N="13">13. That he &s;hould be qualified to become an enlightened and good citizen; under&s;tand the nature, de&s;ign and kinds of govern|ments, and the reciprocal duties of the governors and the governed.</P>
<P N="14">14. Finally, That he &s;hould have &s;uch an acquaintance with the dead and living languages, as will qualify him for any pro|fe&s;&s;ion, employ his lei&s;ure by drinking from the original &s;ources of information, or at him to hold a communication with modern nations for the purpo&s;es, of &s;cience, commerce or recreation.</P>
<P>To obtain the&s;e advantages, would require that a tutor &s;hould &s;uperintend the education of his pupils through the following acts, &s;cience, and languages: Reading, Engli&s;h grammar, elo|cution, writing, arithmetic of integers, vulgar and decimal fraction, &s;hort hand, hi&s;tory, chronology, geography and the u&s;e of the globes, The following branches of &s;imple mathematics;</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="035626_0012_1006114B51CFB140">
Men&s;uration, geometry, trigonometry and algebra, general principles, including logic, rhetoric and compo&s;ition, ethics and the &s;cience of government. La&s;tly, The Latin, Greek and French languages. Such is the cour&s;e through which I doubt not men of enlarged minds would wi&s;h their children, by natu|ral and ea&s;y &s;teps to be conducted; &s;uch is the cour&s;e through which I offer to conduct them. If it will not perfect them, no plan of education is de&s;igned to do it. I have been &s;olely led to this &s;election, by a &s;entiment of general utility. It does not <HI>include an object but what has important u&s;es to a young gentlemen, whatever be his particular de&s;tination in life, and that as long as life &s;hall la&s;t.</HI> Whatever bye-path I may wi&s;h to conduct my &s;on through in any future period, this is the high road he &s;hould fir&s;t be familiar with, and on which I would accustom him to exerci&s;e him&s;elf. To be a phy&s;ician, a legal character, an officer of government, or a theologian, would require that he &s;hould a&s;cend this &s;cale in regular gradation; and without &s;uch a previous progre&s;s, he will in all probability &s;oon de&s;cend not to ri&s;e again. With &s;uch qualifications as a proper &s;tudy of this cour&s;e will give him, I doubt not but any young gentleman would &s;oon <HI>fit him&s;elf for any particular department.</HI> And &s;uch a cour&s;e begun early in life, conducted with order, per&s;everence and talent, may be fini&s;hed &s;ufficiently early to enter into any &s;cene of ac|tive life. Like the &s;trong current of a wide navigable river, it ea&s;ily conducts them to other diverging &s;treams, and all fall at la&s;t into tho&s;e great waters, on which men navigate for honour, profit or plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>Having delineated the parts of a liberal education, that pa|rents my be at no lo&s;s to conceive how I would proceed in &s;e|curing them, I &s;hall thew what is the mo&s;t ea&s;y, expeditious, plea&s;ant and &s;ucce&s;sful method of doing this. I give the follow|ing as the re&s;ult of my own ob&s;ervation. The&s;e various branches &s;hould be taught by &s;eparate cla&s;&s;es, at particular hours allotted for the objects of each cla&s;s. Upon the u&s;ual plan of day-&s;chools, a great number of young gentlement are a&s;&s;embled in the &s;ame room, at the &s;ame time; who learning a variety of different branches, nece&s;&s;arily di&s;tract each other's attention, when in fact they ought to a&s;&s;i&s;t it. The explanation which it is requi&s;ite for the profe&s;&s;or to give upon one &s;ubject, weakens and calls off the attention of tho&s;e who pur&s;ue another. The attention of the tutor is kept perpetually on the &s;tretch; having to an&s;wer in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion que&s;tions upon topics totally unconnected with each other, his mind is more di&s;tracted, and his temper more tried: be&s;ides, are not habits of a de&s;ultory nature unavoidably formed in young men, from the nece&s;&s;ity which &s;uch a practice re|duces
<PB N="16" REF="035626_0013_1006114E919A35D8">every tutor to, of hearing &s;everal different cla&s;&s;es at the &s;ame time? It is equally impo&s;&s;ible for him to make tho&s;e re|marks, which are nece&s;&s;ary to correct the ta&s;te or enlarge the mind.</P>
<P>On the contrary, I pre&s;ume it will be evident, that where a definite number a&s;&s;emble to attend to the &s;ame object, at the &s;ame meeting, according to the plan I am going to lay down, none of the&s;e di&s;advantages can take place. I will &s;uppo&s;e then, the tutor provided with the be&s;t text books the country will afford, for the branches of this cour&s;e. At the clo&s;e of the period allotted to each cla&s;s, let him explain a part of the ele|mentary treati&s;e; let every pupil be obliged to commit this to memory, in readine&s;s for the next meeting; let them repeat it memoritor, or give the ideas in their own language; let them be obliged to prove that they under&s;tand principles, by giving diver|&s;ified examples in conver&s;ation and writing. This exerci&s;e will add new force to the memory by enlightening the under&s;tanding. At &s;hort &s;tated intervals there &s;hould be a regular clo&s;e examina|tion of the whole learnt within that period. The &s;ciences &s;hould be in&s;tilled by the Socratic mode of conver&s;ation and memory; the arts by numerous exerci&s;es to form the requi&s;ite habits; the rea&s;on of every practice &s;hould be &s;crupulou&s;ly pointed out, and the tutor &s;hould never de&s;i&s;t, till the &s;cholar has given proof of <HI>real knowledge.</HI> By proceeding on &s;uch a plan, the evils of our common day-&s;chools will be obviated, and the time requi&s;ite for any particular branch may be calculated. When a wi&s;e man undertakes a journey, he fir&s;t determines upon the mo&s;t expeditious way of arriving at the end, and &s;ecuring the object of it. If a guide be nece&s;&s;ary, he will chu&s;e one who is be&s;t acquainted with the road.</P>
<P>Such is the method in which I think education &s;hould be con|ducted. But aware of the force of prejudice and the reluctance parents would feel to their children not being employed the whole of the day, under the eye of a tutor, I propo&s;e to execute the above cour&s;e by a morning and afternoon &s;chool, as at pre|&s;ent; and to divide into 5 Cla&s;&s;es.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="curriculum">
<HEAD>CLASS I.</HEAD>
<P>Will include the art of reading different &s;pecies of pro&s;e and poetry, elocution, writing, and the grammar of the Engli&s;h language. This will &s;uit children from 6 to 8 or 10 years of age. As all knowledge begins with particular facts, and chil|dren are univer&s;ally mo&s;t intere&s;ted by them, their books will
<PB N="17" REF="035626_0014_1006115048760FB8">relate to natural hi&s;tory, civil and religious biography, proper|ties of things, cu&s;toms, moral principles as taught by fables and other &s;pecies of writing accommodated to their tender age. To the art of reading will &s;ucceed the Engli&s;h grammar. As lan|guage is not only a mean of mental improvement, but of &s;ocial communication, and, on a knowledge of our <HI>own,</HI> mu&s;t be found|ed that of the Latin, Greek and modern languages, a more than ordinary attention will be given to this. We can <HI>only go from the known to the unknown.</HI> Spelling will be connected with this. The art of writing will begin with the &s;imple&s;t principles. I have nothing to add to the catechi&s;m on this &s;ubject already before the public. Terms, 8 dollars per quarter; 5 dollars entrance.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="curriculum">
<HEAD>CLASS II.</HEAD>
<P>Will include arithmetic of integers, fractions vulgar and decimal, book-keeping, &s;hort-hand, geography and u&s;e of the globes, hi&s;tory and chronology. Terms, 12 dollars per quar|ter; 5 dollars entrance.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="curriculum">
<HEAD>CLASS III.</HEAD>
<P>Will include men&s;uration, geometry, trigonometry and al|gebra. Terms, 15 dollars per quarter; 5 dollars entrance.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="curriculum">
<HEAD>CLASS IV.</HEAD>
<P>Will be taught general principles, including logic, rhetoric, compo&s;ition, moral philo&s;ophy, and the nature of political con&s;ti|tutions.&mdash;As there is a gradation in &s;cience and in our own powers, &s;o &s;hould there be in our manner of teaching. The ea&s;ie&s;t branches &s;hould be &s;ucceeded by the more difficult. The dead languages &s;hould follow our own, and general principles an acquaintance with particular facts. Natural and civil hi&s;tory, biography and natural philo&s;ophy, are the proper materials of ju&s;t thinking. Terms, 15 dollars per quarter; 5 dollars entrance.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="curriculum">
<HEAD>CLASS V.</HEAD>
<P>Will con&s;i&s;t only of tho&s;e who learn the Latin, Greek, and French languages.&mdash;15 dollars per Quarter; 5 dollars entrance.</P>
<P>Much has been written to abbreviate the time u&s;ually devot|ed to languages. Men of literature have complained with ju&s;tice:
<PB N="18" REF="035626_0015_10061152A51A0C00">but more remains to be done. Among&s;t the grammarians who have wi&s;hed to remedy this evil, may be ranked Cowley and Lewis, Milton and Vo&s;&s;ius, Clarke and Hoadly, John&s;on and Lowe: Tanaquil Faber and Philips, have publi&s;hed &s;ome judicious ob&s;ervations on their method of teaching the learned languages. Per&s;ons are not yet agreed which of the&s;e &s;hould be taught fir&s;t. Some have recommended the Hebrew. David Williams and Gregory Sharp, the Greek. But European cu&s;tom begins with the Latin; and there is not doubt but any modern lan|guage may be learnt without either, though not to that advan|tage. Leaving the&s;e remarks as extraneous to my &s;ubject, I &s;hall ob&s;erve, that the only objects any man can propo&s;e to him&s;elf in learning either dead or living languages, are the three following. 1. To &s;eize with preci&s;ion the ideas the authors meant to convey. 2. To be able to compo&s;e in the language with grammatical propriety. Or, 3. To be able to &s;peak in them for the different purpo&s;es of &s;ocial communication. The object of the Greek and the Latin is <HI>now</HI> u&s;ually confined to the fir&s;t. That of the modern, as the French, frequently include all three. The only means yet di&s;covered for attaining the&s;e &s;everal objects are reduced to the four following. 1. By accu&s;toming the eye to receive impre&s;&s;ions from the con&s;tant peru&s;al of authors in tho&s;e languages. 2. By impre&s;&s;ions made on the ear in conver&s;ation, or reading an author aloud: thus good reading becomes an aux|iliary to ju&s;t pronunciation, and the meaning of a language &s;teals in by the ear. 3. By exerci&s;ing our&s;elves in compo&s;ing mentally or by writing. This renders our knowledge of the con&s;truction of a language more definite, and enables us to corre&s;pond with others. 4. By daily conver&s;ation in the language. In general, we neither learn to &s;peak dead languages, nor hear them &s;poken; our object is either to under&s;tand or compo&s;e; we therefore u&s;ually learn them by impre&s;&s;ions on the eye, or by writing exerci&s;es.</P>
<P>This cla&s;s will begin with the grammar of the Latin language; a knowledge of which will be much facilitated by a previous ac|quaintance with that of the Engli&s;h. Every grammar nece&s;&s;arily con&s;i&s;ts of the mo&s;t <HI>ab&s;tract</HI> ideas: hence children never under|&s;tand them without much labour, and are generally aver&s;e to them. Few parts of learning have been le&s;s productive to young men than that of languages. The rea&s;on is evident; exerci&s;es of memory do not infer tho&s;e of the judgment; and boys u&s;ually be|come wordy parrots and mere prating machines! A good tutor will be able to remedy this <HI>Vox et praeterea nihil.</HI> After having commit|ted &s;ome &s;hort, clear and comprehen&s;ive grammar to memory, the pupil &s;hould be able to give a rational an&s;wer to every que&s;|tion in his own words. Knowledge has its characteri&s;tics, and a
<PB N="19" REF="035626_0016_10061155202B1798">man of &s;en&s;e will &s;oon perceive whether his pupils have gained the object of their labour. The vocabulary will give a copiou&s;|ne&s;s of words. Exerci&s;es in the fir&s;t three parts of grammar may begin in Sententiae Pueriles, or any book con&s;i&s;ting of &s;hort pe|riod and ea&s;y con&s;truction. To this &s;hould &s;ucceed a cour&s;e of <HI>pro&s;e</HI> writers, due attention being paid to the nature of the &s;tyle; &s;uch as Eutropius, Florus, Cornelius Nepos, Cae&s;ar, Quintus Curtiss, and Ju&s;tin. The <HI>idioms</HI> of the language &s;hould be carefully pointed out. The <HI>Roman Hi&s;tory</HI> in Engli&s;h, Ken|net's Roman Antiquities, Plutarch's Lives and Ancient Geogra|phy, well dige&s;ted. Whil&s;t the&s;e authors are analized by the application of the grammatical rules, Latin exerci&s;es &s;hould be written for the &s;ame purpo&s;e. In &s;ome of the colleges of France they make u&s;e of a book, entitled, "Les Racines dela langue Latine," which will enable a &s;cholar to decompo&s;e the lan|guage. Hermes Anglo-Latinus is an excellent little book, and Au&s;onius Ropma de Differentiis verborum, would be a valuable acqui&s;ition, to our &s;chools. In tran&s;lating, the complete &s;en&s;e of the writer &s;hould be given, without the tire&s;ome and inju|rious method of taking every word &s;eparately; and the con|&s;truction in no ca&s;e be forced. As &s;oon as the tutor perceives that the knowledge of con&s;truction, idiom, hi&s;tory, &amp;c. is &s;ufficiently advanced, he may permit a le&s;s literal tran&s;lation. I am decidedly of opinion, that a young gentleman &s;hould be con&s;iderably <HI>advanced in tran&s;lating pro&s;e before he attempts poetry.</HI> The pro&s;ody of pro&s;e &s;hould be taught before that of poetry; and each may be learnt by a few di&s;tinct exerci&s;es, without that con&s;umption of time which the reading every le&s;&s;on mu&s;t occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>While a pupil is applying his knowledge of <HI>figurative</HI> &s;yntax by reading of Phoedrus, or Ovid, he &s;hould be taught the theo|ry of ver&s;ification; the mythology of the Romans, from Tooke's Pantheon or Spence's Polymetis; learn a &s;hort treati&s;e on the figures of rhetoric, and ply his Gradus ad Parnassum. The&s;e will facilitate his knowledge of Virgil, Horace, Terence, Martial, Catullus, Ber&s;ius, and Juvenal. His cour&s;e in pro&s;e will clo&s;e with different treati&s;es of Cicero, Suetonius, Livy, and Tacitus. If found nece&s;&s;ary, the profe&s;&s;or may introduce &s;ome other au|thors in the two &s;pecies of compo&s;ition; but I pre&s;ume the cour&s;e already marked out, will be found amply &s;ufficient to qualify any young gentleman to apply the Roman language to any purpo&s;e his future circum&s;tances may require. To conver&s;e, if nece&s;&s;ary, with learned foreigners, will be by no means diffi|cult, as I found my&s;elf during my re&s;idence in France.</P>

<HEAD>The GREEK COURSE</HEAD>
<P>Should be conducted on the &s;ame principles, in which the pu|pil will read his Greek Te&s;tament, Potter's Antiquities, Xeno|phon's Cyropaedia and Memorabilia, Demoithenes and Thuci|dides, Longinus, Demetrius, Phalerius, Lucian, Pindar, Ho|mer, Euripides and Sophocles.</P>

<HEAD>The FRENCH LANGUAGE</HEAD>
<P>Mu&s;t be learnt by each of the four methods already pointed out. Its acqui&s;ition will be rendered ea&s;y, together with that of the Italian, Portugue&s;e and Spani&s;h, by an accurate knowledge of the Latin.</P>

<DIV2 TYPE="instructions">
<P>The reader will perceive, that to every qualification which a wi&s;e and liberal &s;y&s;tem of education aims to &s;ecure, there cor|re&s;ponds &s;ome particular branch of knowledge. This un&s;ecured, time, labour and expence, may be pronounced wholly and eter|nally lo&s;t. To prevent &s;o fatal, and I am &s;orry to add &s;o common an evil, every tutor &s;hould lay down &s;uch a code of <HI>Laws,</HI> as, with the vigorous co-operation of parents, will give him the highe&s;t probability of &s;ucce&s;s. The&s;e laws &s;hould fix the attention, promote order, pre&s;erve &s;ilence, inculcate manners, and infu&s;e a &s;pirit of enquiry and the love of truth. A day-&s;chool, con|ducted on &s;uch principles, will indirectly form youth to the mo&s;t important virtues.</P>
<P>Every young gentleman &s;hould have a place a&s;&s;igned for him|&s;elf, his hat, books, &amp;c. This will prevent de&s;ultory, di&s;or|derly carele&s;s habits, and a litigious &s;pirit. No pupil &s;hould be permitted to play in the cla&s;s-room with his fellow. The place &s;hould be &s;acred to mental cultivation, and &s;o impre&s;s the &s;cholar the moment he enters.</P>
<P>No one &s;hould be permitted to offend again&s;t the law of man|ners; mutual rudene&s;s engenders mutual animo&s;ity. Two pupils &s;hould not be allowed to come before the tutor at the &s;ame time, except they are in the &s;ame cla&s;s: this is a needle&s;s con|&s;umption of time. No one &s;hould be permitted to leave his &s;eat without a rea&s;onable cau&s;e, conver&s;e on any &s;ubject but his &s;tu|dies, nor learn any le&s;&s;on with an audible voice.</P>
<P>Two pupils &s;hould not be ab&s;ent at the &s;ame time, and no one out of the cla&s;s-room more than five minutes.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="035626_0018_1006115A0216B6B8">
Every pupil &s;hould have a regular portion of labour a&s;&s;igned him for every evening.</P>
<P>Every pupil &s;hould keep a weekly account of his progre&s;s. Every cla&s;s &s;hould go through a weekly, monthly, and quar|terly examination.</P>
<P>All indecorum, ari&s;ing from reproachful names, and mutual blows, &s;hould be con&s;idered as interruptions to the cour&s;e of education.</P>
<P>Every pupil, who, after repeated admonition and due report made to his parents, continues to fru&s;trate the de&s;ign of the meeting, by indolence, impudence, ob&s;tinacy or moro&s;ene&s;s, ought to be expelled the cla&s;s-room.</P>
<P>Corporal puni&s;hment for the youth of either &s;ex, in a day-&s;chool properly regulated, is &s;eldom nece&s;&s;ary, and as &s;eldom effectual. The corporal puni&s;hment of beating, for want of memory, di&s;cernment, accidental inattention or mere inadvert|ence, is <HI>contemptible.</HI> The corporal puni&s;hment of flogging, is <HI>&s;ervile, immode&s;t, execrable;</HI>&mdash;but too often the deba&s;ing re|fuge of groveling pedagogues! Even Horace complains of one Orbilius, whom he &s;urnames <HI>Plago&s;us,</HI> his &s;choolma&s;ter, who ac|cording to Domitius Mar&s;us, communicated knowledge by the <HI>ferula et &s;cutica:</HI> no wonder that Suetonius &s;hould denominate him a <HI>&s;our man.</HI> No remedy can equally apply to all: puni&s;h|ments of &s;hame and neglect have often been found more power|ful than any other. I am &s;orry to add, that until our children are brought up with <HI>more rational ideas of liberty and independence,</HI> the apprehen&s;ion of &s;ome puni&s;hment is rendered nece&s;&s;ary. Want of delicacy generates impertinerce; delu&s;ive and un&s;ub|&s;tantial ideas of con&s;equence lead to in&s;olence, and any opinions of liberty, of <HI>which ju&s;tice to all mankind is not the &s;oul, produce the two mo&s;t tremendous evils,</HI> that can bla&s;t the comforts of a &s;ocial &s;tate,&mdash;<HI>ruthle&s;s tyranny, and de&s;olating anarchy.</HI> If in any ca&s;e, puni&s;hment by blows be found indi&s;pen&s;able, it is for &s;ullen &s;tubbornne&s;s, imperious contempt, and fixed rebellion; but a pro|fe&s;&s;or, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of that addre&s;s which a know ledge of the human mind will ever give, will &s;eldom be under the nece&s;&s;ity of u&s;ing any violent remedy. To bring this Pro&s;pectus to a conclu&s;ion&mdash;</P>
<P>If education be that in&s;trument of intellectual and moral per|fection, which the God of nature has put into our hands,&mdash;if its influence upon the whole of human happine&s;s be now con|&s;idered by all civilized nations of an evidence equal to intuition,
<PB N="22" REF="035626_0019_1005EDE8F1B37ED8">rendered &s;o, by the fatal experience of &s;o many ages, whence that deathly &s;tupor that has benumbed the faculties of man? Why has its commanding energy been &s;o little felt in &s;ociety? I an&s;wer, To the culpable carele&s;&s;ne&s;s, or bu&s;y engagements of parents, has been long united &s;hameful ignorance in tho&s;e who &s;uperintend the tuition of youth. The mo&s;t important branch of knowledge, and that which can alone render education omni|potent, is the lea&s;t cultivated, I mean, the <HI>Theory of the Mind.</HI> The di&s;re&s;pect with which the generality of teachers are treated, and the pittance of pecuniary emolument which ari&s;es from the profe&s;&s;ion, di&s;courage characters be&s;t qualified from embarking in it. Hence it becomes the <HI>refuge of indigence or the re&s;ort of bankruptcy.</HI> The ancients po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed more practical wi&s;dom; it was with them a calling of honour. Their nobles taught gratuitou&s;ly, and the expence of a tutor was a &s;econdary con&s;ideration. From the ignorance already mentioned, have ari&s;en books of all kinds the lea&s;t adapted to the juvenile mind, and methods directly &s;ub|ver&s;ive of the object of all education. Let the&s;e evils be correct|ed; let profe&s;&s;ors be &s;ought, who know how to render truth de|&s;irable and virtue lovely,&mdash;who to the knowledge of man, unite the dignity of moral character,&mdash;who can in&s;pire a pupil with the emulation of him&s;elf, unalloyed by the knawing envy of another,&mdash; who can conciliate affection, &s;upport authority, and habituate to &s;ubordination,&mdash;who can be &s;evere without &s;ullenne&s;s, and familiar without degradation,&mdash;who can repre&s;s in&s;olence, fix caprice, invigorate attention, and di&s;tingui&s;h the faults of levity from the criminality of vice,&mdash;who, mindful of the maxim of Horace, with a &s;light alteration, <HI>"Puerum rege; qui ni&s;i paret imperat,"</HI> can &s;upport authority without tyranny; while that of Seneca, <HI>"Si vis amari, ama,"</HI> teaches him to in&s;pire love without hypocri&s;y. I repeat it; let &s;uch men be &s;ought, and receive a compen&s;ation equal to the talents requi&s;ite for &s;uch an ardous undertaking: the dawn of a new aera will appear&mdash;magi&s;trates will have le&s;s crimes to puni&s;h&mdash;parents le&s;s follies to bewail&mdash;good governments le&s;s in&s;urrections to fear, and the lower cla&s;&s;es le&s;s vices to copy after. Super&s;tition, no longer nouri&s;hed by ignorance, will die to the root. Each &s;ex will be better fitted to be parents, and that ma&s;s of moral and political evil, which has mi&s;erably oppre&s;&s;ed man-kind for ages, gradually mouldering away, we &s;hall &s;ee man voluntarily ari&s;e to that health, innocence, and enjoyment, which a wi&s;e &s;y&s;tem of education and ju&s;t government, will infallibly crown him with.</P>
