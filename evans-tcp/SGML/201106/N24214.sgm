<Q><BIBL>REVELATION xi. 6.</BIBL>

<P>ALREADY I hear the objection, "What proper employment has the &s;peaker here in the&s;e deep waters, where &s;o many have &s;ounded and found no bottom?" But &s;uch an objector would do well to con&s;ider, that the book before us is the book of reve|lation, and not of concealment. In the time of the prophet Daniel, it was clo&s;ed up and &s;ealed with &s;even &s;eals, and &s;o was to continue till the time of the end. Behold now is the time of the end, and one &s;eal is taken off after another by the wondrous works of Di|vine Providence! And even the &s;eventh &s;eal
<PB N="6" REF="032007_0004_0FF09E90C8D06C88">is now opening by the concurrent explana|tion of pre&s;ent expo&s;itors. Hence the knowl|edge of this part of &s;cripture increa&s;es from age to age. The book of Revelation was not put into our hands for no purpo&s;e: It is a greater benefit to us than to tho&s;e in former ages: It was written more e&s;pecially for our learning on whom the ends of the world are come: And he is pronounced ble&s;&s;ed, who reads and hears the words of this prophecy, (Rev. i. 3) and keeps the &s;ayings which are written therein, which fairly implies that we &s;hould labour to under&s;tand what we read and hear. But on the other hand, we &s;hould be careful to maintain Chri&s;tian mode&s;ty, and not pronounce, too po&s;itively where there is but feeble evidence; and a &s;en&s;e of our mental imbecility &s;hould be joined with a &s;pirit of prayer, that Chri&s;t, would open our under&s;tandings to under&s;tand the &s;criptures. Infinite Mercy grant this humility and light, while it is con&s;idered,</P>
<P>Who the&s;e are, which have power to &s;hut heaven and to &s;mite the earth.</P>
<P>What tho&s;e plagues are with which they &s;mite the earth. And</P>
<P>What is meant by their &s;miting the earth as often as they will.</P>
<P N="1">1. Who are the&s;e which have power to &s;hut heaven, and to &s;mite the earth?</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="032007_0005_0FF09E5FD5EBE870">
We fine by the chapter that they are two prophets, two witne&s;&s;es, two candle&s;ticks, and two olive trees, which &s;tand before the God of the earth. And here we mu&s;t re|member that the &s;cripture is the interpreter of it&s;elf: There are, perhaps, few pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture, which have not a key for them, if we can tell where to find it and how to improve it. Let us then inquire whether a key may not be found for the particular pa&s;&s;age in view. The&s;e two witne&s;&s;es are the two candle&s;ticks, &s;ays the context: But what are the two candle&s;ticks? is the next inquiry. Look in Zech. iv. 2, 6. 'And he &s;aid unto me, What &s;ee&s;t thou? And I &s;aid, I have looked, and behold a candle&s;tick all of gold, with a bowl upon the top of it, and his &s;even lamps thereon, and &s;even pipes to the &s;even lamps which are upon the top thereof; and two olive trees by it, one on the right &s;ide of the bowl, and the other on the left &s;ide thereof. So I an&s;wered and &s;pake to the angel, What are the&s;e, my lord? Then he an&s;wered and &s;pake unto me &s;aying. <HI>This is the word of the Lord, &amp;c.'</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">To Zerubbabel. But of the &s;ame nature is the in&s;pired &s;cripture.</NOTE> i. e. <HI>this candle|&s;tick, with the things, which accompany it, is the word of the Lord.</HI> The word of the Lord, we know, is the in&s;pired &s;cripture. There|fore this candle&s;tick mu&s;t be, that which is now the in&s;pired &s;cripture, and &s;o the two candle&s;ticks mu&s;t be the two &s;criptures, the old Te&s;tament and the New. Zechariah
<PB N="8" REF="032007_0006_0FF09E9377697C60">&s;aw but one candle&s;tick; for in his time there was but one Te&s;tament revealed; but John di&s;covers two; for then both Te&s;taments were revealed; both candle&s;ticks were light|ed up.</P>
<P>The two olive trees may <HI>perhaps</HI> &s;ignify Jo&s;hua and Zerubbabel, as types of the law and go&s;pel. For as Jo&s;hua and Zerubbabel were two great in&s;truments in the hand of Chri&s;t to build the &s;econd temple; &s;o are the law and go&s;pel for building the antitype of the &s;econd temple, which is the church of the living God, built on the <HI>foundation of the apo&s;tles and prophets.</HI></P>
<P>Oil is the &s;cripture emblem of the effu&s;ions of the Spirit. And as the oil of the two olive trees was poured into the bowl of the candle&s;tick and lighted up all the &s;even lamps; &s;o all the e&s;&s;ential &s;piritual truths, which partake of the nature both of the law and go&s;pel, were by the Holy Spirit poured into one Old Te&s;tament, and con&s;tituted a perfect light. For though the Old Te&s;ta|ment was a light &s;hining in a dark place, yet it was a perfect one; it contained both the law and the go&s;pel; it contained all that was nece&s;&s;ary to practi&s;e or believe in order to &s;alvation; and both Te&s;taments &s;ub&s;tantially contain no more. While Zechariah &s;aw one candle&s;tick, he beheld two olive trees, and while John &s;aw two candle&s;ticks, he beheld <HI>no more</HI> than two olive trees.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="032007_0007_0FF09E6164813ED0">
As to the &s;even lamps, &s;even we know is the number of perfection. The Lamb has &s;even eyes and &s;even horns, perfect wi&s;dom and perfect power. So the&s;e &s;even lamps &s;ignify the perfect light of the &s;criptures; for thy word, &s;ays David, is a light unto my feet and a lamp to my path, and the law of the Lord is perfect, converting the &s;oul.</P>
<P>That the&s;e two witne&s;&s;es, prophe&s;ying in &s;ackcloth, mu&s;t &s;ignify the Old and New Te&s;tament, will further appear, if we con&s;id|er the main de&s;ign of this book of Revelation, which was to &s;upport and comfort the church wading through Pagan and Popi&s;h per&s;ecu|tions, and to promi&s;e her a complete deliver|ance from all her dangers. Now, one of the greate&s;t dangers to which the church was ex|po&s;ed in tho&s;e dark times, was that of lo&s;ing the Bible: It was in imminent danger not only of being gro&s;sly corrupted, but wholly extirpated from the earth. The Bible is the good man's book, better to him than thou|&s;ands of gold and &s;ilver. What would have become of the woman of Sarepta in the time of famine in I&s;rael, if Elijah had not been there to feed her with oil? and what would have become of the woman in the wilderne&s;s in the time of Popi&s;h famine, if the&s;e two prophets had not been there to feed her with the oil of the &s;anctuary? Therefore, is it not highly rea&s;onable to expect that a few ver&s;es, at lea&s;t, of this prophecy &s;hould be &s;et apart to give promi&s;es of &s;ecurity to a book &s;o
<PB N="10" REF="032007_0008_0FF09E9502973928">precious to the church, and which Chri&s;t fore&s;aw would be expo&s;ed to &s;uch imminent danger; but if no &s;uch particular promi&s;es are found in this eleventh chapter, they are not found at all in the whole book of Reve|lation.</P>
<P>Again; we have further confirmation of what is now advanced, by con&s;idering how unnaturally this prophecy is explained by tho&s;e who have fixed a different meaning to it. Some have &s;uppo&s;ed, that go&s;pel mini&s;|ters and magi&s;trates, others that true Chri&s;|tians in general, and the Walden&s;es in par|ticular, are intended by the&s;e witne&s;&s;es. But what key does the &s;cripture afford for this explanation? And, if there is none, what is this but a mere conjectural glo&s;s? Neither common Chri&s;tians, mini&s;ters nor magi&s;|trates are ever called prophets in other parts of &s;cripture: And why &s;hould there be ex|actly two prophets and no more for one thou|&s;and two hundred and &s;ixty years? Why not rather one hundred and forty-four thou|&s;and, be&s;ide a great multitude? for this is is the enumeration of common Chri&s;tians in other parts of this book. If the number <HI>two</HI> &s;ignify only a &s;mall indefinite number, and their re&s;urrection is the multiplication of their number, as &s;o many &s;uppo&s;e, &s;ome rea|&s;on ought to be a&s;&s;igned why, at lea&s;t, as many as three witne&s;&s;es do not appear after their re&s;urrection; but this chapter mentions
<PB N="11" REF="032007_0009_0FF09E6385EA4458">no more than two after their re&s;urrection, at well as, before.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, the powers a&s;cribed to the&s;e two witne&s;&s;es are very unnaturally applied to common Chri&s;tians or go&s;pel mini&s;ters. When. did the Walden&s;es or other Chri&s;tians ever &s;hut up heaven? When did they turn the waters into blood? When did fire pro|ceed out of their mouths to devour their en|emies? Or what have they done to which the&s;e mighty works may be compared by any proper figure of &s;peech? To evade the force of this argument, it has been an&s;wered that <HI>the &s;aints may be &s;aid to inflict the&s;e plagues on the earth by praying that God would be avenged on their enemies;</HI> but this an&s;wer is by no means &s;atisfactory. When did they ever pray that heaven might be &s;hut up, or that the waters might be turned into blood, in what &s;en&s;e &s;oever the&s;e, plagues may be un|der&s;tood? Never. This con&s;truction there|fore is quite unnatural, and a&s;&s;igns tho&s;e powers to magi&s;trates, mini&s;ters and other Chri&s;tians, which can in no &s;en&s;e belong to them by any figure of &s;peech which the Bi|ble el&s;ewhere u&s;es. Yet the&s;e miraculous powers are very applicable to prophets, and con&s;equently to the two Te&s;taments, which contain the voice of all the prophets &s;ince the world began.</P>
<P>The death and re&s;urrection of the&s;e wit|ne&s;&s;es remarkably agree with the treatment which the two Te&s;taments have &s;uffered from
<PB N="12" REF="032007_0010_0FF09E97804AC888">the oppo&s;ition of their enemies, and their glorious triumph over them. 'When they &s;hall have fini&s;hed their te&s;timony (in &s;ack|cloth) the bea&s;t, which a&s;cendeth out of the bottomle&s;s pit, &s;hall make war again&s;t them, and &s;hall overcome them, and kill them.' Rev. xi. 7. That is, the antichri&s;tian party in a large and general council at Ba&s;il, in 1437, formed a decree, that it was the bu&s;i|ne&s;s of <HI>the church</HI> to determine in what man|ner the wor&s;hip of God &s;hould be carried on. This blow, to &s;peak &s;igurately, took away the very life of the &s;criptures, and all that for which they excel every other book in the world. At that time, the four antichri&s;tian parties, which had been at variance by means of three cotemporary Popes and a difference with re&s;pect to communion, were reconciled; as Pilate and Herod were at the crucifixion of our Lord. This union is here expre&s;&s;ed by their making merry, and &s;ending gifts one to another. 'And they &s;uffered not their dead bodies to be put in graves;' that is, <HI>They would not &s;uffer them to be buried wholly out of their &s;ight.</HI> To bury a decea&s;ed per&s;on is to manife&s;t re&s;pect for him, and peculiar &s;orrow for the calamity which has befallen him: Therefore, the meaning of the figure may be this; <HI>The Papi&s;ts would not &s;uffer any one to pay that re&s;pect to the &s;criptures which was due, or even to mourn for the bold impiety which they had committed!</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Fox's Acts and Mon. Vol. I. page 909. Gla&s;s on the Wit|ne&s;&s;es, page 442. Mo&s;heim's Eccle&s;ia&s;t. Hi&s;t. Vol. II cent. 15.</NOTE> <HI>Three days and
<PB N="13" REF="032007_0011_0FF09E65239CAF18">an half they remained in this condition, then ro&s;e and &s;tood on their feet.</HI> About three years and an half after this Popi&s;h decree, the te&s;timony of &s;cripture was revived and appeared anew, in the reformation formed by the Bohemian brethren, after they had &s;eparated from the Calixtines. Soon after this, the voice was heard, 'Come up hither. And they a&s;cend|ed up to heaven in a cloud, and their ene|mies beheld them;' i. e. the Greeks flying from Con&s;tantinople brought the knowledge of the &s;criptures into the We&s;t, and about the &s;ame time the two Te&s;taments were publick|ly printed in Germany, and by Prote&s;tant protection a&s;cended up out of the reach of their enemies, as much as if they had gone up to heaven, &s;o that the Papi&s;ts could not command them any longer from that day to this.</P>
<P>Finally, It is the part of a witne&s;s to te&s;tify for or again&s;t any per&s;on or thing. Chri&s;t plainly tells us, that the &s;criptures are his witne&s;&s;es, when he &s;ays, 'Search the &s;crip|tures, for in them ye think ye have eternal life, and they are they which <HI>te&s;tify</HI> of me.</P>
<P N="2">II. What are tho&s;e plagues with which they &s;mite the earth?</P>
<P>Smiting the earth here may mean no other than the voice of their prophecy, declaring that certain plagues &s;hall afflict mankind. As by a common figure of &s;peech any one may
<PB N="14" REF="032007_0012_0FF09E99682081B8">be &s;aid to puni&s;h another, when he denoun|ces that &s;entence of puni&s;hment again&s;t him, which is connected with the event; &s;o the&s;e two prophets, by denouncing certain plagues again&s;t the earth, may be properly &s;aid to &s;mite the earth with the&s;e plagues. Thus the prophet Eli&s;ha &s;mote Gehazi by denoun|cing again&s;t him that plague of lepro&s;y, which &s;hould cleave to him and his &s;eed forever. So the prophet Elijah &s;mote the two captains and their fifties. 'If I be a man of God,' he &s;ays, 'let fire come down from heaven and con&s;ume thee and thy fifty.' Therefore the plagues with which the witne&s;&s;es &s;mite the earth, are temporal, &s;piritual and eternal. All temporal judgments, earthquakes, &s;word, famine, pe&s;tilence and bea&s;ts of the earth are inflicted on mankind by the&s;e two witne&s;&s;es declaring the exi&s;tence of them by the voice of their prophecy.</P>
<P>In the &s;ame manner they &s;mite the earth with &s;piritual judgments; a &s;eared con&s;cience, a blinded mind, and an awful &s;terility under the means of grace. I&s;a. vi. 9, 10. 'Go and tell this people, Hear ye indeed, but under|&s;tand not; &s;ee ye indeed, but perceive not. Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and &s;hut their eyes: left they &s;ee with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and under&s;tand with their heart, and convert and be healed.' With this &s;piritual calamity were the unbelieving Jews &s;mitten at Rome, while 'they heard Paul per&s;uading
<PB N="15" REF="032007_0013_0FF09E670D3CCB40">them the things concerning Je&s;us from morn|ing to evening, both out of the law and out of the prophets.' Paul then quoted the pa&s;|&s;age now mentioned, as mo&s;t &s;olemnly appli|cable to their &s;piritual condition.</P>
<P>Of this &s;ort are the plagues &s;poken of in the text. They are evidently of a &s;piritual nature, becau&s;e no &s;uch plagues have ever been literally inflicted on mankind &s;ince the apo&s;tolic age. Heaven has not been &s;hut up one thou&s;and two hundred and &s;ixty years, nor the waters turned into blood in a literal &s;en&s;e; but in a &s;piritual &s;en&s;e how awfully manife&s;t have been the&s;e plagues in the Chri&s;|tian world! There has been a great and ter|rible famine in the Chri&s;tian world; not of bread and water, but of hearing the word of the Lord for one thou&s;and two hundred and &s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ty years: That is, from nearly the end of the &s;econd century<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Then the &s;cripture doctrine began to be explained by Gentile philo&s;ophy, and to be united with tradition as the rule of faith. And after printing was invented, in 1440, &s;chola&s;tic divinity be|gan to &s;ail.</NOTE> to nearly the middle of the fifteenth.</P>
<P>A lively type of this was the famine in I&s;|rael in the days of Elijah, and a lively type was Elijah, as well as Mo&s;es, of the&s;e two prophets. While Jezebel, the type of the Romi&s;h mother of harlo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s, was promoting idolatry and killing the &s;aints, Elijah's word &s;hut up heaven. 'As the Lord God of I&s;rael liveth,' he &s;ays, 'before whom I &s;tand, there &s;hall not be rain nor dew the&s;e years but ac|cording
<PB N="16" REF="032007_0014_0FF09E9B6DF4B988">to my word.' 'The&s;e years;' what years? Three years and an half. Our Lord tells us, Luke iv. 25. that 'In the days of Elias the heaven was &s;hut up three years and &s;ix months, and great famine was throughout all the land:' And the apo&s;tle James &s;ays, that 'Elias prayed earne&s;tly that it might not rain, and it rained not on the earth by the &s;pace of three years and &s;ix months.' This &s;pace of time is taken great notice of in &s;cripture prophecy. Three years and &s;ix months are ju&s;t the &s;ame as one thou&s;and two hundred and &s;ixty days, and ju&s;t the &s;ame as forty-two months, and ju&s;t the &s;ame as a time, times and an half: for a time is a year, times are two years, and half a time is half a year. The &s;ame is expre&s;&s;ed by a time, times, and the dividing of time. That is, three years and an half, which are half &s;even. Seven is the number of perfection, half &s;ever is half perfection, which is utter imperfection: and as God has mea&s;ured the duration of his own perfect works by the number &s;even, &s;o he has &s;een fit to mea&s;ure the duration of the&s;e imperfect and wicked works of men with their &s;ad con&s;equences by ju&s;t half this number. And as Elijah by his word &s;hut up heaven and cau&s;ed a great famine in I&s;rael for three years and an half; &s;o the two witne&s;&s;es by the word of their prophecy have &s;piritual|ly &s;hut up heaven, and cau&s;ed a great famine upon the Chri&s;tian world, for three prophet|ical years and an half. And as in the time
<PB N="17" REF="032007_0015_0FF09E6946892050">of famine in I&s;rael the prophet Elijah fed the woman of Sarepta with oil; &s;o the&s;e two wit|ne&s;&s;es in the time of Popi&s;h famine have fed the woman in the wilderne&s;s with &s;piritual oil, that &s;he through faith and comfort of the &s;criptures might have hope. She had 'a place prepared her of God, where <HI>they</HI> &s;hould feed her;' that is, where the&s;e two prophets &s;hould 'feed her a thou&s;and two hundred and three&s;core days.'</P>
<P>Thus it appears, that not a literal, but a &s;piritual famine was inflicted upon the earth by the&s;e two prophets in the days of Popery; in con&s;equence of which the waters were turned into blood. To explain which we mu&s;t con&s;ider what tho&s;e ble&s;&s;ings are, which are in the &s;ame manner u&s;eful to our &s;pirit|ual life as waters are to our natural life.</P>
<P>As there are rivers in the world, the &s;treams of which delight and refre&s;h the body; &s;o 'there is a river, the &s;treams of which make glad the city of God.' In the latter flow the waters mentioned in the text: and the&s;e waters mu&s;t &s;ignify, either the in|ward joys and graces of the true Chri&s;tian, or the external ordinances and means of grace; but they cannot &s;ignify the former, they cannot &s;ignify the inward joys and graces of the true Chri&s;tian: for the&s;e, in what|ever &s;ouls they re&s;ide, are never turned into blood; but are in them, a well of water &s;pringing up unto everla&s;ting life. There|fore the waters of the text can &s;ignify noth|ing
<PB N="18" REF="032007_0016_0FF09E9DF2CB1CE0">el&s;e but the outward ordinances and means of grace.</P>
<P><HI>But how were the&s;e turned into blood?</HI> Con|&s;ider what the &s;ad effect was, when Mo&s;es in Egypt turned the waters into blood, to which this pa&s;&s;age undoubtedly alludes. By this change, the waters of Egypt were rendered not only u&s;ele&s;s, but exceedingly injurious, and tended rather to aggravate their thir&s;t than a&s;&s;uage it. So that flood of errors and &s;uper&s;tition into which the true doctrines and ordinances of the go&s;pel were changed in the days of Popery and by the word of prophecy, was not only u&s;ele&s;s, but exceedingly injuri|ous to the &s;ouls of men. As good water is very nece&s;&s;ary and comfortable to the body, but when turned to blood, becomes exceed|ingly hurtful to the body; &s;o the true doc|trines and ordinances of the go&s;pel are very nece&s;&s;ary and comfortable to the &s;oul; but, when turned to &s;uper&s;tition and lies, become exceedingly hurtful to the &s;oul. Among the Heathen and among the Papi&s;ts, the truth of God was changed into a lie; and what was the con&s;equence? 'They wor&s;hipped and &s;erved the creature more than the Creator, who is over all, God ble&s;&s;ed forever.' By this time it is ea&s;y to &s;ee how naturally the change of waters into blood repre&s;ents the change of truth into a lie, and of genuine doctrines into vile &s;uper&s;titions: And that this plague was inflicted by the two witne&s;&s;es, appears from I&s;a. lxvi. 4, and from 2 The&s;&s;.

<P N="3">III. What is meant by their &s;miting the earth as often as they will?</P>
<P>This may &s;ignify the e&s;tabli&s;hed and infal|lible connexion between the voice of proph|ecy and the event. It was a marvellous di&s;|play of power given to the prophet Elijah, when he only &s;pake the word and down came the fire from heaven and devoured his ene|mies. A lively and &s;olemn apprehen&s;ion of this had the third captain with his fifty, when he fell upon his knees and begged for mercy. He was apprehen&s;ive that the prophet could, if he would, utterly con&s;ume him with all his armed fifty, and his apprehen&s;ion was ju&s;t: for the will of that prophet, under divine in|&s;piration, was the will of God. The &s;ame power and will have the two prophets now
<PB N="20" REF="032007_0018_0FF09EA0222B2588">treated of. But how unnatural is it to rep|re&s;ent the two Te&s;taments as having exerci&s;es of will, &s;ays the objector. But why more unnatural than to repre&s;ent them as &s;peaking and hearing a voice, as the &s;cripture it&s;elf does? Yet the latter is no more true or nat|ural, when viewed in a literal &s;en&s;e, than the former, but in figurative language how ea&s;y is the tran&s;ition from an intelligent voice to a will dictating that voice. Therefore, as the language of &s;cripture may be properly called the voice of the &s;cripture, &s;o the &s;en&s;e of that language may be properly called the will of the &s;cripture, being God's will and the will of all the in&s;pired prophets. There|fore the meaning of the la&s;t clau&s;e of the text &s;eems to be, that whatever plagues the two Te&s;taments denounce &s;hall certainly and in|fallibly come to pa&s;s. The word of the Lord endureth forever: heaven and earth &s;hall pa&s;s away before one jot or tittle of it &s;hall fail. The will of the&s;e two witne&s;&s;es is the will of God: therefore, whatever threaten|ings they denounce again&s;t the finally im|penitent &s;hall &s;urely be accompli&s;hed. Their word has alreadly de&s;troyed a multitude of &s;inners; it has brought a deluge upon the old world, fire on Sodom, blood and famine on Jeru&s;alem, and utter ruin on Babylon; and the &s;ame voice of the&s;e prophets has &s;cat|tered the Jews over the earth: and &s;o, where-ever the&s;e two prophets &s;peak again&s;t their enemies, they &s;mite; every threatening is
<PB N="21" REF="032007_0019_0FF09E6DBA979E58">a blow, every word a wound. The everla&s;t|ing mountains &s;hall be &s;cattered, and the per|petual hills &s;hall bow; but forever, O Lord, thy word is &s;ettled in heaven.</P>
<P>A few inferences &s;hall clo&s;e the &s;ubject.</P>
<P N="1">1. Is the power and authority of the&s;e witne&s;&s;es &s;o very great in the world? How dangerous then the condition of all tho&s;e who de&s;pi&s;e and ridicule them, and call in que&s;|tion their veracity! Many &s;uch bold objects of Chri&s;tian compa&s;&s;ion may now be ob&s;erved in the world. As Jannes and Jambres with|&s;tood Mo&s;es by endeavouring to repre&s;ent him as an impo&s;tor, &s;o do the&s;e men al&s;o re|&s;i&s;t the truth by endeavouring to repre&s;ent as impo&s;tors the&s;e two anointed ones, which &s;tand before the God of the earth. But they &s;hall proceed no further than the bounds allotted them by the&s;e very prophets, whom they de&s;pi&s;e, and who&s;e never-failing predic|tions a&s;&s;ure us, that there mu&s;t come mockers to grieve the godly in the la&s;t times. Like Jannes and Jambres ere long their mouths will be &s;topped, and their folly will be mani|fe&s;t unto all men, as theirs al&s;o was. How &s;wiftly the day approaches which &s;hall burn as an oven, and all the&s;e proud, go&s;pelized infidels &s;hall be as &s;tubble, and the day that cometh &s;hall burn them up, that it &s;hall leave them neither root nor branch! For, ob&s;erve the context, 'If any man will hurt them, fire proceedeth out of their mouths and devour|eth their enemies; and if any man will hurt
<PB N="22" REF="032007_0020_0FF09EA2812E2790">them, he mu&s;t in this manner be killed.'<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Here is another evident allu&s;ion to the prophet Elijah; fig|uratively &s;peaking, fire proceeded out of his mouth when he con|&s;umed the two captains and their fifties.</NOTE> The threatening is repeated, as Pharaoh's dream was, to &s;hew, perhaps, that the proph|ecy is certain, and the plague foretold is &s;ure.</P>
<P>And what is this plague? what is this fire? It is the fire which &s;hall burn the world, the fire of hell; the fire which &s;hall burn the bea&s;t and the fal&s;e prophet.</P>
<P>If any man will hurt them, i. e. if any man &s;hall take away part from the prophecy of this book,&mdash;and much more, if he take away all, 'God will take away his part out of the book of life;' 'and who&s;oever was not found written in the book of life, was ca&s;t into the lake of fire.' This is the fire which proceedeth out of their mouths: for it is the mouth of the &s;cripture which denounceth that fire,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">I will make my words in thy mouth fire, &s;aith the Lord to the prophet, Jeremiah, chap. v. 14.

<P N="2">2. How terrible is the condition of all tho&s;e who &s;uffer tho&s;e &s;piritual plagues, with which the&s;e prophets &s;mite the earth: &s;piritual fam|ine, &s;piritual barrenne&s;s and mortality of &s;oul under the means of grace! What greater cur&s;e than the &s;ig-tree cur&s;ed! 'Let no man eat fruit of thee hereafter forever.' They have eyes and eye-&s;ight, ears and hearing, and yet they neither &s;ee nor hear; they grope at noon-day as in the night, and &s;tagger with their eyes open like a drunken man. Let

It is the very nature of &s;in to darken the mind and hold a fal&s;e picture of things continually before our eyes. Hence follows &s;peculative darkne&s;s with re&s;pect to moral things. The righteous providence of God often gives men over to a bad faith as the puni&s;hment of a bad heart. Such was the puni&s;hment of the ancient heathen: 'Be|cau&s;e, that when they knew God,' &s;ays Paul, 'they glorified him not as God; and did not like to retain him in their knowledge; he gave them up to uncleanne&s;s, to vile affections, to a reprobate mind; who changed the truth of God into a lie.' Such was the puni&s;hment of the Jews, cut off for unbelief: The vail is yet on their hearts, while Mo&s;es is read be|fore them. Such was the puni&s;hment of the Chri&s;tians after the pure and glorious go&s;pel had &s;hone before them; heaven was &s;hut up over them, as already &s;hewn, and their waters turned into blood; and I think the &s;cripture tells us,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rev. xvi. 13, 14.</NOTE> that the Chri&s;tian world &s;hall be &s;mitten once more with &s;piritual plagues, with &s;trong delu&s;ion, infidelity and fal&s;e religion. And if &s;o, though the pre&s;ent age is very corrupt, the next will, doubtle&s;s, be more &s;o, both in principle and practice: for the day of the Lord is at hand, and upon the wicked God &s;hall rain &s;nares, and then fire and brim|&s;tone.</P>

And what the Papi&s;ts have done, has already been ob&s;erved. Yet the witne&s;&s;es are &s;till alive, they have ri&s;en and a&s;cended, and their enemies have beheld them with grief and di&s;appointment. The Popi&s;h famine, there|fore, is nearly ended.

<HEAD>A DISSERTATION ON THE INTRODUCTION AND GLORY OF THE <HI>MILLENNIUM.</HI></HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="introduction">
<HEAD>PRELIMINARIES.</HEAD>
<P>THE works of God are a perfect beauty: Light and &s;hade, angel and devil; all are nece&s;&s;ary to con&s;titute this perfection. All his works prai&s;e him: the wrath of man and the rage of elements: every crea|ture is thus engaged in heaven and earth and under the earth and in the &s;ea. As for God, his way of providence is perfect. He is wonderful in coun&s;el and excellent in work|ing. Nothing is made,&mdash;nothing is done in vain through all the immen&s;ity of &s;pace and duration.</P>
<P N="2">2. All beauty is con&s;tituted by harmony or &s;imilarity in variety; &s;uch is the beauty of the natural world. It is full of re&s;em|blances, full of imitations amid&s;t infinite va|riety.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="2" REF="032007_0026_0FF09EA668A9D5F8">
3. The natural world re&s;embles the &s;pir|itual world; otherwi&s;e there could be no &s;uch thing as metaphor, type, allegory, or any compari&s;on between matter and mind.</P>
<P N="4">4. As the works of providence are not le&s;s beautiful than the works of creation, &s;o they are not le&s;s con&s;picuous for &s;imilarity in variety. The annual revolutions, varied in re&s;pects innumerable, all have their days and nights, &s;ummer and winter, &s;eed-time and harve&s;t.</P>
<P>The &s;ame con&s;titutes the beauty of ages; one order of events in one age of the world is a lively picture of another order of events in another age of the world. Hence the propriety of many types in the Old Te&s;ta|ment of per&s;ons and things, cities, nations and countries. Hence al&s;o appears the rea|&s;on why &s;o many prophecies in &s;cripture have &s;everal a&s;pects to &s;everal different periods of time, as ever has been allowed by the mo&s;t learned expo&s;itors.</P>
<P>A &s;ingle &s;entence in prophecy predicts an event or period of events, with all its types and antitypes. Canaan was an image of the go&s;pel re&s;t, and the go&s;pel re&s;t is an image of the Millennium, and the Millennium will be an image of heaven. Therefore the promi&s;e of Canaan to Abraham was a promi&s;e and proph|ecy of all the&s;e Canaans and all the&s;e periods of duration. And it is manife&s;t that the prophecies, in general, of the Old Te&s;tament which predict the Chri&s;tian di&s;pen&s;ation, do
<PB N="3" REF="032007_0027_0FF09E76734F3930">in the &s;ame language, the &s;ame &s;entences pre|dict the Millennium, having an a&s;pect to both the&s;e happy periods. 'The thing which hath been, it is that which &s;hall be, and that which is done, is that which &s;hall be done, and there is no new thing under the &s;un.'</P>
<P N="5">5. Gods, in his infinite love and mercy, has &s;ent us, for in&s;truction, a pre&s;ent from heaven, a map of his works, pa&s;t, pre&s;ent, and to come. Ble&s;&s;ed are tho&s;e eyes which can properly &s;urvey it, and tho&s;e humble hearts which can be thankful for it! On a map of the globe, cities, mountains, lakes and rivers in all countries, are di&s;tingui&s;hed by &s;imilar notations. By ob&s;erving then in what manner any known country is deline|ated, we may under&s;tand too the geography of others which are unknown: So on this map of ages, by properly ob&s;erving the de|lineation of any order of events already known to us, we are the better prepared to judge of the like order of events which are yet future.</P>
<P N="6">6. Small maps of the globe give only &s;ome general ideas of its various regions: So the map before us, though perfectly accurate, is very &s;mall, and affords but a general idea of the &s;tupendous and glorious events which &s;hall be accompli&s;hed hereafter.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I. THE PLAN OF THE SUBJECT PROPOSED AND EXPLAINED.</HEAD>
<P>A COMPENDIOUS map of the globe pre&s;ents only principal objects, while the innumerable &s;maller are under&s;tood to be in connexion with them.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Bible, the mo&s;t excellent of books, continually pre&s;ents to our view the mo&s;t ex|cellent of God's works, that of Redemption, while it teaches, that all other works are &s;ub|&s;ervient to it.</P>
<P N="3">3. This work of redemption is commen|&s;urate with time, and will not be fini&s;hed till Chri&s;t delivers up the kingdom to the Father. It is he who carries on this mo&s;t glorious work in his triple capacity of Prophet, Prie&s;t and King.</P>
<P N="4">4. Accordingly, the Bible has di&s;tingui&s;h|ed the order of the work of redemption by three general di&s;pen&s;ations of grace, which &s;eem to be re&s;pon&s;ive to the&s;e three offices. The fir&s;t di&s;pen&s;ation was peculiarly prophet|ical; all the types were &s;o many prophecies, and the prophecies of the New Te&s;tament are little more than the expo&s;ition of tho&s;e which are found in the O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d.</P>
<P>The &s;econd di&s;pen&s;ation is peculiar for the exhibition of Chri&s;t's prie&s;tly character, not only in his own per&s;on, but in his people:
<PB N="5" REF="032007_0029_0FF09E78609654B8">Every martyr is a prie&s;t, and every martyr|dom a &s;acrifice, by Phil. ii. 17; and the martyrdoms, under our di&s;pen&s;ation, are more numerous than tho&s;e under the old by a thou&s;and to one. Chri&s;t introduced our di&s;pen&s;ation by the voluntary &s;acrifice of him|&s;elf, and &s;till continues to di&s;tingui&s;h it from the old by his work of interce&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Accordingly, the third di&s;pen&s;ation will be peculiar for the exhibition of Chri&s;t's kingly character, not only in his own per&s;on, but in his people, as appears by Rev. v. 10, xx. 4. 'And ha&s;t made as unto our God kings and prie&s;ts, and we &s;hall reign on the earth.&mdash; They lived and reigned with Chri&s;t a thou|&s;and years.'</P>
<P N="5">5. The fir&s;t di&s;pen&s;ation was an image of the &s;econd, as appears from all the types of the Old Te&s;tament: The fir&s;t had a Babylon and a vile per&s;on to afflict the church; and &s;o has the &s;econd. In like manner the &s;ec|ond is an image of the third, as appears in that, by the conce&s;&s;ion of the be&s;t commenta|tors, the mo&s;t important events of both are predicted by the &s;ame &s;entences of prophecy.</P>
<P N="6">6. The three di&s;pen&s;ations mu&s;t have three revelations or witne&s;&s;es; the Old Te&s;tament, the New Te&s;tament, and the more immediate teaching of Chri&s;t him&s;elf. The pre&s;ent rev|elation explains the old, and the third will explain both. And will not Chri&s;t then ap|pear as the Logos far more gloriou&s;ly than ever he did before? It does in a mea&s;|ure
<PB N="6" REF="032007_0030_0FF09E7A6CCC5688">appear by Rev. xi. 6, that Mo&s;es and Elijah, two eminent prophets, are u&s;ed by the Holy Gho&s;t as types of our two Te&s;taments. Mo&s;es turned the waters into bloody, and Elijah &s;hut up heaven. The Old Te&s;tament wor&s;hip &s;eems to have been a rod in the hand of him who cho&s;e their delu&s;ions to turn the waters of the Chri&s;tian world into blood, as already explained in the preceding &s;ermon. Popery in part is the mi&s;improvement of Old Te&s;tament wor&s;hip. Elijah cured the people of idolatry; and for this purpo&s;e the New Te&s;tament rather than the Old is re|markably calculated. Hence, perhaps, it was, that when the three di&s;ciples beheld on the mount the repre&s;entation of Chri&s;t's fu|ture glory; the truth of which the Te&s;ta|ments unitedly confirm, Mo&s;es and Elias, rather than other prophets, appeared in har|monious conver&s;e with Je&s;us.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Peter, relating what he &s;aw on the holy mount, &s;ays, <HI>(hai echomen beb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">ron ton propheti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">on logon)</HI> we have more firm the prophetic word.</NOTE></P>
<P>The words which Daniel heard, but un|der&s;tood not, (Dan. xii. 8, 9) were clo&s;ed up and &s;ealed till the time of the end, and then this &s;ealed book was opened to John, by a new revelation from heaven. But when John had a &s;imilar vi&s;ion, he had &s;imilar in|&s;truction. 'Seal up tho&s;e things which the &s;even thunders uttered, and write them not:' We mu&s;t therefore expect a new revelation to explain what the &s;even thunders uttered. As the &s;ealed words which Daniel heard
<PB N="7" REF="032007_0031_0FF09E7BFA7D30B8">were not explained but by a new revelation; &s;o we have no rea&s;on to expect that the &s;ealed voices of the &s;even thunders will be explain|ed but by a new di&s;pen&s;ation and a new rev|elation from heaven.</P>
<P N="7">7. Each di&s;pen&s;ation mu&s;t conclude by a day of judgment, &s;evering the wicked from the ju&s;t. Thus ended the fir&s;t di&s;pen&s;ation; the Jewi&s;h nation were de&s;troyed, while the Chri&s;tians, by believing and obeying Chri&s;t's word, all marvellou&s;ly e&s;caped, a Dr. New|ton tells us out of &s;everal hi&s;torians.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">We do not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ad, any where, that &s;o much as one of them peri&s;hed in the d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">tion of Jeru&s;al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">m. <HI>Di&s;&s;ertation on the P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ph<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ol.

To both the&s;e days of judgment the prophecy of our Saviour refers, in the xxivth. of Matthew, and xxi&s;t of Luke, which &s;hews that the former repre&s;ented the latter. The end of the next di&s;pen&s;ation will be the univer&s;al judgment, when all &s;in will be &s;ev|ered from holine&s;s, and all the wicked from the ju&s;t, to a&s;&s;ociate no more forever; who|&s;oever is not written in the book of life &s;hall then be ca&s;t into the lake of fire.</P>
<P N="8">8. Accordingly there mu&s;t be three re&s;|urrections. At the end of the la&s;t di&s;pen&s;a|tion, there was a re&s;urrection of Chri&s;t and many of the &s;aints. At the end of the pre&s;|ent, there will be a re&s;urrection of many

<P>The fir&s;t of the&s;e re&s;urrections gave death a wound; the &s;econd will give this enemy a deeper wound, and the third will utterly de|&s;troy him. 'For as in Adam all die,' &s;ays Paul, '&s;o in Chri&s;t &s;hall all be made alive. But every man in his own order, Chri&s;t the fir&s;t fruits, afterward they who are Chri&s;t's at his coming.

<P>To all the&s;e three periods that may refer in Mal. iv. 1. 'Behold, the day cometh that &s;hall burn as an oven; and all the proud, yea, all they that do wickedly, &s;hall be as &s;tubble: and the day that cometh &s;hall burn

<P N="10">10. As there are no more than three offi|ces of Chri&s;t revealed in his word; &s;o, by Art. 4th, we are not to expect more than three di&s;pen&s;ations.</P>
<P>It will not be denied that the Millennium, or third di&s;pen&s;ation, will, if po&s;&s;ible, as much excel the pre&s;ent for the exten&s;ivene&s;s of its ble&s;&s;ings, as the pre&s;ent excels the for|mer; and if &s;o, it is certain that all the globe 'will be full of the knowledge of the Lord as the waters cover the &s;ea:' and con&s;e|quently the third day of judgment mu&s;t be the day of univer&s;al judgment, and the &s;tate of all mankind mu&s;t then be &s;uch as cannot admit of another antitype or fourth di&s;pen|&s;ation.</P>
<P>Three di&s;pen&s;ations afford a natural con|&s;truction for that in Matt. xiii. 33. 'The kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven, which a woman took and hid in <HI>three</HI> mea&s;ures of meal, till the whole was leavened.' Jehovah him&s;elf is Trinity in unity, and his works are what they are, becau&s;e He is what He is. The work of mediation is a divine, mo&s;t glorious and perfect work: and "in every divine, complete work," &s;ays the famous Swedenborg, "there is a <HI>Trine,</HI> which is called fir&s;t, middle and la&s;t. From this ground it is, that by <HI>three</HI> in the &s;piritual &s;en&s;e of the word is meant what is complete and perfect. And whereas this is the &s;igni|fication

<HEAD>CHAP. II. THE MILLENNIUM A NEW GENERAL DIS|PENSATION OF GRACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE po&s;itive in&s;titutions, which the Old Te&s;tament church received in different peri|ods, may perhaps be called particular di&s;pen|&s;ations, in di&s;tinction from the whole of them included in the Mo&s;aic economy. For they were all of one general nature; all were pro|phetical and typical, all were a &s;hadow of good things to come; and in tho&s;e ages no in&s;titution was aboli&s;hed, when a new one was introduced. Therefore all the Old Te&s;|tament economy was one general di&s;pen&s;a|tion of grace. The pre&s;ent &s;tate of the church is allowed to be another general di&s;|pen&s;ation, clearly di&s;tinct from the former. It is now to be con&s;idered, whether there will not be a new di&s;pen&s;ation; <HI>a new order of things,</HI> with re&s;pect to the church and re|ligion, as clearly di&s;tinct from the pre&s;ent as the pre&s;ent is from that of the Jews.</P>
<P>Under the old di&s;pen&s;ation, the Jews had a Millennium in pro&s;pect as well as we. They were in con&s;tant expectation of a glorious time, in which holine&s;s and happine&s;s &s;hould be general, if not univer&s;al; but they con|&s;idered that glorious time only as the con|tinuation of their own di&s;pen&s;ation, and ex|pected that the nations would embrace their
<PB N="12" REF="032007_0036_0FF09EAE0E62DC80">religion and their kind of government; that all fle&s;h would wor&s;hip at their temple, from one <HI>new moon</HI> to another, and from one <HI>&s;ev|enth day</HI> Sabbath to another. They expected as a nation to have a portion in this promi&s;ed glory with the re&s;t of mankind. And in gen|eral it appears, that both the righteous and the wicked among them had the &s;ame lead|ing &s;entiments on this &s;ubject. The nature of our di&s;pen&s;ation was doubtle&s;s as well known to the Apo&s;tles when Chri&s;t aro&s;e as to any of the pious Jews; and yet they a&s;k, 'Lord, wilt thou at this time re&s;tore again the kingdom to I&s;rael?' Of the like nature are the views and expectations of Chri&s;tians in general at this day. <HI>The Millennium is at hand,</HI> &s;ay we, <HI>to make our po&s;terity happy, and all nations happy, under the imperfect govern|ment of mere men, by their embracing the exter|nals as well as the internals of our religion; the Millennium will be a glorious continuance of our own di&s;pen&s;ation.</HI></P>
<P>Now, &s;ince the&s;e our expectations &s;o near|ly re&s;emble tho&s;e of the Jews, it is certainly a matter of importance to inquire whether they have any better foundation in the word of prophecy. It is from the &s;ame Old Te&s;|tament prophecy that both Jews and Chri&s;|tians have formed the&s;e &s;imilar ideas of their two Millenniums. And how plainly do the&s;e prophecies declare, that the promi&s;ed glory &s;hall be introduced by a day of judgment; 'A day which &s;hall burn as an oven;' by a
<PB N="13" REF="032007_0037_0FF09E8237780ED8">re&s;urrection, and by the coming of Chri&s;t to take vengeance on his enemies<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I&s;a. lxvi. 15&mdash;20. Mal. iv. 1.

The&s;e and &s;imilar pa&s;&s;ages, we &s;ay, are figurative; but may not a Chri&s;tian as effectually deceive him|&s;elf by a con&s;truction of prophecy too figur|ative, as a Jew by a con&s;truction too literal?</P>
<P>Now, if it can be proved that there will be imperfect holine&s;s and death among man|kind in the Millennium; that the Sun of righteou&s;ne&s;s will per&s;onally appear in the morning of that day; that there will then be a partial conflagration and a re&s;urrection; the inference is nece&s;&s;ary, that there will be a new di&s;pen&s;ation or order of things with re&s;pect to the church, as di&s;tinct from the pre&s;ent as the pre&s;ent is from that of the Jews. Therefore, to obtain evidence of the&s;e prop|o&s;itions mu&s;t be the attempt of the follow|ing &s;ections.</P>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD><HI>SECTION I.</HI> There will be a State of Imperfection among Mankind in the Millennium.</HEAD>
<P>THOUGH the prophecy of the new heav|ens and earth &s;eems to have ultimate refer|ence to the perfect &s;tate of glory; yet, by the general con&s;ent of expo&s;itors, it includes
<PB N="14" REF="032007_0038_0FF09EAFA2504570">the Millennium, that brighte&s;t image or the heavenly &s;tate, which will ever exi&s;t in the world. As the works of creation from one day to another were more and more ex|cellent, and proceeded from inferior to &s;u|perior exhibitions of God's character; &s;o do the works of providence, and particularly tho&s;e of redemption. As the pre&s;ent &s;tate of the church far exceeds that of the Jews; &s;o the millennial &s;tate will far exceed the pre&s;ent, and form the nexus between earth and heaven, as &s;oon may appear more clearly.</P>
<P>But &s;till there will be imperfect &s;aints in that time, and multitudes of bold tran&s;gre&s;|&s;ors at the conclu&s;ion of that time: For,</P>
<P N="1">1. In the de&s;cription of the new earth, (I&s;a. lxv. 20) we plainly read of &s;in and death; that 'the child &s;hall <HI>die</HI> an hun|dred years old;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is not foretold as a cur&s;e, but as a ble&s;&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ng, as appears from its connexion with the preceding &s;entence which predicts longevity as a ble&s;&s;ing.

Why? 'For the child &s;hall die at hundred years old.'</NOTE> but the &s;inner, an hundred years old, &s;hall be accur&s;ed.' And Rev. xxii. 2, that 'the leaves of the tree (of life) were for the <HI>healing</HI> of the nations.' This &s;entence is not hi&s;tory, but prophecy, and therefore we explain it mo&s;t naturally when we con&s;ider it as referring, not to that which &s;hall then be pa&s;t, but to that which &s;hall exi&s;t in the time here predicted. Dr. Gill upon this pa&s;&s;age, labouring to vindicate the millennari|an hypothe&s;is, endeavours to avail him&s;elf of
<PB N="15" REF="032007_0039_0FF09E85909DB920">the original, and &s;ays, "That the Greek here &s;hould be rendered <HI>pre&s;erving</HI> in&s;tead of <HI>healing;</HI>" but the an&s;wer is, that <HI>healing</HI> is the mo&s;t natural con&s;truction of the Greek word THERAPEIAN, and the other con&s;truction would confound the u&s;e of the leaves with the u&s;e of the fruits. Be&s;ides, here is an evident allu&s;ion to Ezek. xlvii. 12, pre|dicting undoubtedly the &s;ame period and the &s;ame events; 'The fruit thereof &s;hall be for meat, and the leaf thereof for medicine.'<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">itheruphah</HI> from <HI>Rapha,</HI> &s;ignifying invariably <HI>to heal,</HI> never to pre&s;erve, according to Buxtorf.

<P N="2">2. The prediction 'that the kings (or civil powers) of the earth &s;hall bring their glory and honour into the New Jeru&s;alem,' &s;eems not con&s;i&s;tent with a &s;tate of univer&s;al perfection.</P>
<P N="3">3. When Satan &s;hall be loo&s;ed at the ex|piration of the thou&s;and years, 'he &s;hall go out to deceive the nations which <HI>are</HI> in the four quarters of the earth.' Rev. xx. 8; but they are not the wicked rai&s;ed from the dead, as &s;ome Millennarians believe; for when the wicked &s;hall ri&s;e again, they will not be de|ceived, but undeceived. The re&s;urrection of the wicked is &s;poken of afterwards, ver&s;e 12, 13, with its &s;olemn con&s;equences.

<HEAD><HI>SECTION II.</HI> The Millennium introduced by Chri&s;t's per&s;onal Appearance.</HEAD>
<P>IT was the ancient opinion, that the whole thou&s;and years will be the day of judgment; in the morning whereof &s;hall be the coming of Chri&s;t in flaming fire, and the particular judgment of antichri&s;t; and in the evening whereof &s;hall be the univer&s;al judgment. In the Millennium, Chri&s;t 'will <HI>judge</HI> among the nations, and rebuke many people.' 'He &s;hall judge the living as well as the dead at his appearing and kingdom.' 2 Tim. iv. 1. So that the whole Millennium may be properly termed <HI>the day</HI> of judgment, and perhaps thou&s;ands of years &s;ucceeding it.</P>
<P>Now the inquiry is, Whether Chri&s;t will not per&s;onally appear when this great day of judgment &s;hall commence? For the &s;olution of which the following arguments are &s;ub|mitted to the contemplation of the candid and deliberate Chri&s;tian.</P>
<P N="1">1. If this &s;olemn appearance is to be at the conclu&s;ion of the Millennium, it would be
<PB N="17" REF="032007_0041_0FF09E872A424490">natural to expect that &s;ome prophecy of that happy time would conclude by &s;ome plain and particular de&s;cription of Chri&s;t as com|ing from heaven in the clouds, or in &s;ome other manner: For the &s;eries of a particular prophecy is ordinarily parallel with that of its accompli&s;hment; but we no where find, either in the Old Te&s;tament or New, any &s;uch de&s;cription at the conclu&s;ion of &s;uch a prophecy. The account of the Millennium in Rev. xxth. though conci&s;e is very particu|lar: And fir&s;t, an angel comes down from heaven 'having the key of the bottomle&s;s pit.' "This angel is Chri&s;t," &s;ays Dr. More: "it is he who has the key of the bottomle&s;s pit; it is he who has the keys of hell and of death." At the conclu&s;ion of this chapter, Chri&s;t appears on a throne; but there is no mention of his coming from heaven in any manner whatever.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e prophecies of the Old Te&s;tament, which mo&s;t clearly predict the coming of Chri&s;t, and the Millennium, plainly repre|&s;ent the former, not as that which &s;hall &s;uc|ceed, but as that which &s;hall introduce the latter. The de&s;cription of the new heavens and earth, I&s;a. lxvth. and lxvith. chapters, is con&s;idered by the be&s;t commentators as a prophecy of our go&s;pel glory and that of the Millennium, and the former as the figure of the latter. And in chap. lxvi. 14&mdash;17, how plainly it appears, that the future glory is in|troduced by the coming of the Lord with fire,
<PB N="18" REF="032007_0042_0FF09EB290DF32D8">and with his chariots or clouds ('for he maketh the clouds his chariots.' P&s;a. civ. 3) 'to render his anger with fury, and his re|buke with flames of fire.' Now, &s;ince it is allowed that our go&s;pel glory typifies the Millennium, and that the de&s;truction of the Jewi&s;h world typifies the de&s;truction of the Chri&s;tian world; with equal propriety may we con&s;ider the fir&s;t coming of Chri&s;t as a type or repre&s;entation of his &s;econd coming. His fir&s;t coming was with a 'fan in his hand thoroughly to purge his floor, and gather his wheat into his garner, and to burn the chaff with fire unquenchable.' Matt. iii. 12. And &s;uch will be the bu&s;ine&s;s of his &s;econd coming. Here then is a &s;olemn and glorious prediction with a double a&s;pect; to the fir&s;t coming of Chri&s;t to de&s;troy the Jewi&s;h world and introduce our di&s;pen&s;ation; and to the &s;econd coming of Chri&s;t to de&s;troy the Chri&s;|tian world and introduce the Millennium, the former being a type of the latter. We have &s;een in what order the type has been fulfilled: What doubt then can remain of the completion of the antitype in the &s;ame order?</P>
<P>So in Zech. xiv. we have a clear prophecy of the Millennium <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s introduced by the com|ing of Chri&s;t, ver&s;e 5. 'The Lord my God &s;hall come, and all the &s;aints with thee.' Whenever the &s;cripture el&s;ewhere mentions Chri&s;t's coming with his &s;aints, it is ever al|lowed to &s;ignify his per&s;onal coming: Here
<PB N="19" REF="032007_0043_0FF09E899F9D2F78">then the &s;ame phra&s;e, other things being equal, &s;hould have the &s;ame acceptation. Be&s;ides, it is a maxim with divines, that the literal &s;en&s;e of &s;cripture &s;hould always be pre|ferred to a &s;en&s;e merely figurative, when it does not oppo&s;e the analogy of faith. Other &s;uch prophecies there are, which, for brevity's &s;ake, are omitted; but which the reader may examine as opportunity may occur.</P>
<P N="2">2. It is holden by all expo&s;itors, that the &s;eventh vial will introduce the Millennium. The &s;ixth vial gives warning of that coming of Chri&s;t, which &s;hall be as a thief, and which &s;hall put the unwatchful to &s;hame, Rev. xvi. 15. 'Behold, I come as a thief; ble&s;&s;ed is he who watcheth and keepeth his garments, le&s;t he walk naked, and they &s;ee his &s;hame.' Whenever the &s;cripture el&s;e|where mentions Chri&s;t's coming as a thief, it always means his per&s;onal coming. Now, if Chri&s;t will not per&s;onally appear till the conclu&s;ion of the thou&s;and years, no rea&s;on can he a&s;&s;igned why this &s;olemn warning &s;hould be fixed under the &s;ixth vial rather than under the &s;eventh; but if Chri&s;t &s;hould appear in the morning of that day, the warn|ing can be no where &s;o properly fixed as where we find it. q. d. <HI>One more vial, and then I come. Now if ever, O Chri&s;tians, watch and keep your garments, le&s;t you walk naked, and they &s;ee your &s;hame.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. At the marriage of the Lamb, Rev. xix. 7, all agree, the Millennium will commence.
<PB N="20" REF="032007_0044_0FF09EB6376F96E0">But in Matt. xxv. 6, the repre&s;entation is, that when Chri&s;t &s;hall come as a bridegroom, he will come per&s;onally.

<P N="4">4. Tho&s;e &s;criptures which repre&s;ent the millennial &s;tate as the <HI>kingdom</HI> of Chri&s;t, de|&s;cribe it in &s;uch a manner as affords clear ev|idence that the world will then be favoured with Chri&s;t's per&s;onal pre&s;ence. This is David's kingdom, &s;o frequently predicted by the prophets; by Jer. xxxiii. 15, 'I will rai&s;e unto David a righteous Branch, and a King &s;hall reign and pro&s;per, and &s;hall exe|cute judgment and ju&s;tice in the earth;' and by Ezek. xxxiv. 23, 24, and xxxvii. 24, 'David my &s;ervant &s;hall be king over them (my people.) A prince over them, and a prince <HI>among</HI> them.' Such is the de&s;cription of Chri&s;t's future kingdom in Zech. xiv. 9, compared with ver&s;e 5th, and in Dan. vii. and 2 Tim. iv. 1. And the time when the kingdoms of this world &s;hall become the king|doms of our Lord, Rev. xi. 15, 18, will be the time when the dead &s;hall be judged, and Chri&s;t will de&s;troy them who de&s;troy the

The com|ing of the faints is mentioned in ver&s;e 13; 'I &s;aw in the night vi&s;ions, and, behold, one <HI>like</HI> the Son of Man came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of Days, and they brought him near before him.'</P>
<P>Some have &s;uppo&s;ed that this Ancient of Days is God the Father, and con&s;equently that the 13th ver&s;e predicts Chri&s;t's a&s;cen&s;ion to him; but this explanation cannot be the true one: for, 1. This de&s;cription of the Ancient of Days does not re&s;emble any de|&s;cription of the Father, which the &s;cripture el&s;ewhere affords; yet it is very &s;imilar to that of Chri&s;t in the f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">&s;t chapter of the Rev|elation. 2.

Therefore the time, when the Ancient of Days and one like the Son of Man &s;hall come, cannot be the time of Chri&s;t's a&s;cen|&s;ion: for the a&s;cen&s;ion of Chri&s;t took place long before the little horn had exi&s;tence, and hence it appears that the Ancient of Days can be no other but He, 'who&s;e goings forth have been from of old, from everla&s;ting.' The Son of Man too, in ver&s;e 13, &s;ignifies Chri&s;t. "From hence <HI>the Son of Man</HI> came to be a known phra&s;e for the Me&s;&s;iah among the Jews, and from hence it was taken and u&s;ed &s;o frequently in the go&s;pels" for this acceptation. Yet <HI>this one like</HI> the Son of Man, which Daniel &s;aw, mu&s;t be the people of the &s;aints, as appears from his being brought to the Ancient of Days, and from the explana|tion of this vi&s;ion in the la&s;t of the chapter. To this one <HI>like</HI> the Son of Man,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Chebar, <HI>one like the Son of Man,</HI> is a noun &s;ingular; &s;o is g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">am Chadhi&s;t, <HI>the people of the &s;aints.</HI> A confirming evidence of the propriety of this expo&s;ition. It is u&s;ual for the &s;cripture to &s;peak of a &s;ociety of per&s;ons under the character of one: The man of &s;in is a great number of per&s;ons.</NOTE> &s;ays the vi&s;ion, was given dominion and glory and a kingdom; and accordingly the explanation &s;ays, The kingdom and dominion, and great|ne&s;s of the kingdom under the whole heaven, was given to the people of the &s;aints of the Mo&s;t High. It is holden by all Prote&s;tants, that the bea&s;t with the little horn is the Ro|man bea&s;t with Popi&s;h power: and here we are taught that, when the Ancient of Days

<P>That this is the per&s;onal appearance of Chri&s;t and of the &s;aints, appears from the harmony of this de&s;cription with tho&s;e pa&s;|&s;ages, which are allowed by all to &s;ignify their per&s;onal coming. Tho&s;e texts, which con|fe&s;&s;edly predict this &s;olemn event, repre&s;ent it as attended with fire and an innumerable company of &s;aints and angels: And here we read that 'His throne was as the fiery flame, and his wheels as burning fire. A fiery &s;tream i&s;&s;ued and came forth from before him; thou&s;and thou&s;ands mini&s;tered unto him, and ten thou&s;and times ten thou&s;and &s;tood before him.' Here too one like the Son of Man comes with the clouds, ver&s;e 13. And where does the &s;cripture &s;peak of Chri&s;t or his &s;aints coming with the clouds, without intending their per&s;onal coming?</P>
<P>Indeed, it &s;eems impo&s;&s;ible to conceive how a mere figurative con&s;truction can be fixed on this pa&s;&s;age which would render the &s;en&s;e ea&s;y and natural. What &s;piritual behaviour &s;hall appear in the &s;aints hereafter, or what &s;hall be done to them, which may be com|pared to their collecting and meeting Chri&s;t in the clouds, by any figure of &s;peech which the &s;cripture u&s;es? But, if we allow this pa&s;|&s;age
<PB N="27" REF="032007_0051_0FF09F11DE4494B8">to &s;peak for it&s;elf, how exactly it accords with other &s;criptures, which declare that 'the &s;aints &s;hall be one;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John xvii. 21.</NOTE> &s;hall be caught up to|gether in the clouds,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">1 The&s;&s;. iv. 17.</NOTE> to meet the Lord in the air, and that by the in&s;trumentality of an|gels, who &s;hall gather the elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.'<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Matt. xxiv. 31.</NOTE> Be&s;ides, it is granted by all, that the fulfilment of Daniel's prophecy extends to the <HI>time</HI> of Chri&s;t's per&s;onal coming.

Mu&s;t we &s;uppo&s;e that an event of &s;uch infinite concernment to mankind; to which all the preceding events are &s;ub&s;ervient, and to which the prophecy extends; &s;hould be wholly omitted in this prophecy? By no means. Therefore this coming of Chri&s;t and the &s;aints mu&s;t need<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> be per&s;onal, and that which &s;hall de&s;troy Popery and the Chri&s;tian world.</P>
<P N="9">9. The principal events of the above prophecy are briefly predicted, with an evi|dent allu&s;ion thereto, in the &s;econd epi&s;tle to the The&s;&s;alonians. The fir&s;t chapter men|tions the future revelation of Chri&s;t in flam|ing fire; and as the &s;ubject continues to the next, the Apo&s;tle exhorts them not to be &s;haken in mind, or di&s;couraged, as though Chri&s;t would not appear at all, if he did not
<PB N="28" REF="032007_0052_0FF09EBE613CF4F8">appear in a few years: 'Now we be&s;eech you, brethren, by the coming of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and by our gathering together unto him, that ye be not &s;oon &s;haken in mind, neither by &s;pirit nor by word nor by letter as from us, as that the day of Chri&s;t is at hand. Let no man deceive you by any means.' Then he tells them what &s;hall be fir&s;t; not a Millennium, but a falling away, and the revelation of that Wicked one, 'whom the Lord &s;hall con&s;ume by the Spirit of his mouth, and de&s;troy by the brightne&s;s of his coming.' Here <HI>the coming of Chri&s;t,</HI> or a like phra&s;e, is three times u&s;ed in the com|pa&s;s of a very few ver&s;es. The two fir&s;t ver&s;es which have this phra&s;e, are allowed to &s;ignify that coming of Chri&s;t which &s;hall be per&s;onal; and when it is here mentioned the third time, the &s;ame &s;ubject is continued; and the plain de&s;ign of the &s;ubject is to &s;atisfy the minds of Chri&s;tians re&s;pecting <HI>the time</HI> of Chri&s;t's <HI>per&s;onal</HI> coming. Therefore, when this phra&s;e is here u&s;ed the third time, a figurative &s;en&s;e mu&s;t not be admitted without &s;ome bet|ter rea&s;on than merely to &s;upport an hypoth|e&s;is. Such a con&s;truction is unnatural; a perplexity of language without a beauty, and oppo&s;ite to the Apo&s;tle's de&s;ign, as before ob|&s;erved, leaving the mind of the Chri&s;tian as much in the dark as ever with re&s;pect to the time of Chri&s;t's per&s;onal coming.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The argument of Mr. Spalding on this pa&s;&s;age, page 6, appears to the writes worthy of particular notice. "The Apo&s;|tle is here di&s;cour&s;ing," he &s;ays, "concerning the proper coming of Chri&s;t and u&s;ed the &s;ame word, tees parou&s;ias, coming, to con|vey &s;uch an idea in the fir&s;t ver&s;e; and no &s;ign being given of the variation of its meaning, is could not be u&s;ed to convey a dif|ferent idea in the eighth ver&s;e, and be intelligible: for if the &s;ame di&s;tingui&s;hing mark of the difference, they can give no in|&s;truction. Paul did not u&s;e words in this manner. Nothing can be more unwarranted from the &s;tyle of his writings, than to &s;up|po&s;e he u&s;ed the word <HI>coming,</HI> in the fir&s;t ver&s;e, for the proper com|ing of Chri&s;t, and in a few following ver&s;es before he left the &s;ub|ject, without the lea&s;t intimation of varying its meaning, u&s;ed it again, for his word or Spirit, or for &s;ome event of Divine Provi|dence, we know not what." Can this rea&s;oning be fairly an|&s;wered?</NOTE> "It was
<PB N="29" REF="032007_0053_0FF09F05B5745B50">a point of great importance," &s;ays Dr. New|ton, in favour of this comment, "for the The&s;&s;alonians not to be mi&s;taken in this par|ticular: becau&s;e if they were taught to be|lieve that the coming of Chri&s;t was at hand, and he &s;hould not come according to their expectation, they might be &s;taggered in their faith; and finding part of their creed to be fal&s;e, might be ha&s;ty enough to conclude that the whole was &s;o. The Apo&s;tle therefore cautions them in the &s;tronge&s;t manner again&s;t this delu&s;ion, and a&s;&s;ures them that other memorable events will take place before the coming of our Lord." Doubtle&s;s then this pa&s;&s;age means as it &s;peaks, when it declares that Chri&s;t will de&s;troy the man of &s;in by the brightne&s;s of his coming. So the phra&s;e was explained by Ju&s;tin Martyr: "Chri&s;t &s;hall appear from heaven in glory," he &s;ays, "when the man of apo&s;ta&s;y, &s;peaking great things again&s;t the Mo&s;t High, &s;hall vex us Chri&s;|tians."<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Dialogue with Tripho, page 336.</NOTE></P>

Thus it appears, that the commencement of the Millennium will be rendered glorious by Chri&s;t's per&s;onal pre&s;ence. And accord|ingly, as this &s;olemn and happy &s;cene ap|proaches, the &s;igns of Chri&s;t's coming begin to appear. Nothing can be more vi&s;ible than the following &s;igns of Chri&s;t's coming in the moral world.</P>
<P>Dei&s;m, which laughs at the idea of a God in human form appearing in the clouds, was &s;carcely known formerly in Chri&s;tendom; but now it is come, and come it mu&s;t, to con|firm what it denies, that Peter was a prophet, and Chri&s;t is at hand. 2 Pet. iii. 3, 4. 'There &s;hall come in the la&s;t days &s;coffers, walking after their own lu&s;ts, and &s;aying, Where is the promi&s;e of his coming?' Paul &s;ays, 2 Tim. iii. 'In the la&s;t days perilous times &s;hall come; for men &s;hall be bla&s;phem|ers, ever learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth, men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning the faith; for as Jannes and Jambres with&s;tood Mo&s;es, &s;o do the&s;e men al&s;o re&s;i&s;t the truth.' Jannes and Jam|bres with&s;tood Mo&s;es by endeavouring to rep|re&s;ent him as an impo&s;tor; &s;o do the&s;e men al&s;o re&s;i&s;t the truth by endeavouring to rep|re&s;ent all the prophets as impo&s;tors. It is here predicted too that men &s;hall be 'lovers of their own &s;elves,' which may &s;ignify that the expre&s;&s;ions of &s;elf-love &s;hould abundantly prevail. And, not to mention the abounding of &s;elfi&s;h practices, was there ever an age in
<PB N="31" REF="032007_0055_0FF09EFB319A3630">which &s;elfi&s;h religion was &s;o boldly taught as in this? Was there ever an age, in which there were half &s;o many teachers highly e&s;|teemed, 'who make &s;ad the hearts of the righteous, whom God has not made &s;ad, and &s;trengthen the hands of the wicked; that he &s;hould not turn from his evil way by promi&s;|ing him life.' The&s;e liberal &s;entiments tend to produce liberal conduct, carnal &s;ecurity and licentious practices. Therefore they mu&s;t prevail, and undoubtedly will, more and more, over all the Chri&s;tian world! For it is nece&s;&s;ary when Chri&s;t &s;hall appear, that he &s;hould find the world in ju&s;t juch carnal &s;ecurity as the&s;e &s;entiments mo&s;t evidently produce; that he &s;hould find the world re|lieved from the terror of that old fiction of eternal puni&s;hment, which frighted the Pop|i&s;h ages. 'As in the days that were before the flood, they were eating and drinking, and marrying and giving in marriage, until the day that Noah entered into the ark, and knew not until the flood came, and took them all away; &s;o &s;hall the coming of the Son of Man be.' Matt. xxiv. 38, 39.</P>
<P>Another &s;ign of Chri&s;t's coming, which now appears, is a general belief of the con|trary. The Chri&s;tians in general believe that Chri&s;t will appear &s;ome time or other, but not quickly. They expect fir&s;t a long thou&s;and years, happy years. Already they &s;ee Popery declining, knowledge and liberty prevailing, and pre&s;ently they expect to &s;ee
<PB N="32" REF="032007_0056_0FF09EC2E5E2F1B0">religion too prevailing every where through the Chri&s;tian world; not con&s;idering that the prevalence of knowledge and liberty too, the latter being the effect of the former, loudly announce that 'the day of the Lord is at hand:' for 'even to the time of <HI>the end</HI> many &s;hall run to and fro, and knowledge &s;hall be increa&s;ed.' Dan. xii. 4.</P>
<P>The ancient Chri&s;tians, it is well known, cheri&s;hed no &s;uch opinion as that which is now oppo&s;ed. Polycarp, a di&s;ciple of St. John, intimately conver&s;ant with him, and who doubtle&s;s knew that apo&s;tle's opinion of his own revelation; expre&s;sly taught that Chri&s;t would introduce the Millennium by his per&s;onal appearance. So did Ju&s;tin Mar|tyr, &s;o did all the mo&s;t eminent ancient fa|thers, as Dr. Hammond, a zealous oppo&s;er of the millennarians, was forced to acknowl|edge. But as Popery prevailed, this opin|ion failed; and as Popery in the &s;ixteenth century failed, this opinion prevailed. But now again it is almo&s;t entirely exploded, and the general cry is, Peace and &s;afety&mdash;Salva|tion for all men&mdash;brighter days are approach|ing than were ever enjoyed heretofore&mdash;to|morrow &s;hall be as this day, and much more abundantly. We are come to the age of rea|&s;on. If ever there was a cry of peace and &s;afe|ty in any age of the world, there is now; but what faith the word of prophecy? 'When they &s;hall &s;ay, <HI>Peace and &s;afety,</HI> then &s;udden de|&s;truction cometh upon them, as pain upon a
<PB N="33" REF="032007_0057_0FF09F07F2A7BE30">woman with child, and they &s;hall not e&s;cape.' The &s;cripture mu&s;t be fulfilled, Chri&s;t mu&s;t come as a thief, and at an hour when men in general have no expectation of him.</P>
<P>What is the &s;tate of the Chri&s;tian world in gen|eral at this day, but a &s;ign of Chri&s;t's coming? The Chri&s;tian world in the&s;e la&s;t days, is the antitype of the Jewi&s;h world in their la&s;t days, as Pre&s;ident Edwards has ju&s;tly ob&s;erved.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"God in his providence now &s;eems to be <HI>acting over again the &s;ame part which he did a little before Chri&s;t came.</HI> The age wherein Chri&s;t came into the world, was an age wherein learning greatly prevailed, and was at a greater height than ever it had been before; and yet wickedne&s;s never prevailed more than then. So now, learning is at a great height at this day in the world, far beyond what it was in the age when Chri&s;t appeared; and now the world, by their learning and wi&s;dom, do not know God. They are mi&s;|erably deluded; &s;tumble and fall in matters of religion, as in mid|night darkne&s;s. Tru&s;ting to their learning, they grope in the day time as in the night; run into <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> manner of corrupt opinions and pernicious and fooli&s;h errors.

<P>'The wicked &s;hall do wickedly and none of them &s;hall under|&s;tand;' they &s;hall not di&s;cern the &s;igns of the times.</P></NOTE> The Jews of that time had much more knowl|edge than their ance&s;tors; and how much more enlightened is the pre&s;ent age than any former one! The Jews had many among them who maintained the form of godline&s;s, but denied the power; and how many of this &s;ort have we! The Jews had many Sad|ducees or infidels among them; &s;o have we. The Jews could not get evidence enough that Je&s;us was the Chri&s;t. 'How long do&s;t thou make us to doubt? if thou be the Chri&s;t, tell us <HI>plainly.</HI>' Our Dei&s;ts labour under the
<PB N="34" REF="032007_0058_0FF09EC4C1977498">&s;ame difficulty: "I remember," &s;ays Paley, "hearing an unbeliever &s;ay, that if God had given a revelation, he would have written it in the &s;kies." The Jews &s;aid, 'If we had lived in the days of our fathers, we would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the prophets.' Such is the lan|guage of modern catholici&s;m. There were tho&s;e among the Jews who compa&s;&s;ed &s;ea and land to make one pro&s;elyte, without promot|ing true piety, as our Je&s;uits have done in China, India, and other parts of the globe. And yet there were remarkable revivals of religion among the Jews by the mini&s;try of John, of Chri&s;t and his apo&s;tles. So there are now among us. The dawn of our di&s;|pen&s;ation appeared in that day among the Jews. The light then was not clear nor dark; but it was one (remarkable) day known <HI>to the Lord,</HI> (not to men in general) not day nor night. So the dawn of the Mil|lennium now appears with us; a light not clear nor dark; a day known to the Lord, not to men in general, for they do not di&s;|cern this time.</P>
<P>The mini&s;try of John was a lively repre|&s;entation of what has been performed among Chri&s;tians in the three la&s;t centuries. John was Elias. And the Bible, revived by the invention of the pre&s;s, and improved by the Prote&s;tant mini&s;try, is our Elias. The glo|rious effects are as if Elias had vi&s;ited the world again to cure the people of idolatry.

All tho&s;e nations of &s;inners, which have here|tofore enjoyed and rejected the go&s;pel, &s;hall now be as Sodom and be made like unto Go|morrah,

And thus the prov|idence of God toward the church has been my&s;terious. He has &s;uffered &s;in to practi&s;e and pro&s;per for a time, times and an half. This has been one great part of the my&s;tery of God; a my&s;tery no doubt to angels as well as men. But now the my&s;tery of God &s;hall be fini&s;hed, when the Millennium &s;hall commence, and the &s;eventh angel &s;hall begin to &s;ound.

<P>When Daniel had a &s;imilar vi&s;ion, (chap. xii. 7) he heard the man clothed in linen &s;wear by Him that liveth forever, that 'when he,' i. e. the man of &s;in, '&s;hall have accom|pli&s;hed to &s;catter the power of the holy peo|pley, <HI>all the&s;e things,</HI>' i. e. all the per&s;ecutions of the church, <HI>&s;hall be fini&s;hed.</HI> Hence the propriety of the &s;en&s;e which our tran&s;lators have given to the phra&s;e, CHRONOS OUK ESTAI ETI,<HI>time &s;hould be no longer.</HI> To ren|der it <HI>the time &s;hall not be yet,</HI> gives to the ar|ticle <HI>the</HI> the force of a relative; but there is

How maje&s;tic the po&s;ture of the angel! How terrible his voice as when a lion roareth! How &s;olemn the oath! All to command the greate&s;t at|tention to &s;omething he is about to utter.

<P>The commencement of the &s;eventh trumpet, the &s;eventh vial and the de&s;cent of New Jeru&s;a|lem, all &s;ynchronize by Mr. Mede's Table.

<HEAD><HI>SECTION III.</HI> The next Conflagration not univer&s;al.</HEAD>
<P>WHAT a &s;olemn de&s;cription is that in 2 Pet. iii. 10! 'The day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night, in which the heavens &s;hall pa&s;s away with a great noi&s;e, the elements &s;hall melt with fervent heat, and the earth with the works that are therein &s;hall be burnt up.' That this conflagration will be &s;uch literally, is manife&s;t in that the apo&s;tle does not appear to &s;peak in figura|tive language; but with that familiarity of &s;tyle, which is always proper for an epi&s;tle. It is univer&s;ally allowed that the deluge was &s;uch literally, and here in a familiar letter Peter tells his brethren, that as the old world was de&s;troyed by water, &s;o the pre&s;ent world will be de&s;troyed by fire. 'The elements &s;hall melt with fervent heat;' that is, the pre&s;ent &s;tate of the elements will be in &s;ome manner changed with fervent heat. The pre&s;ent &s;tate of the aerial heavens (above which the P&s;almi&s;t repre&s;ents the waters to be) will then be di&s;&s;olved and pa&s;s away. A tran&s;i|tion perhaps not much unlike that of the air and elements in the land of the four cities when fire and brim&s;tone rained upon them. 'The earth al&s;o and the works which are therein &s;hall be burnt up,' as the land of the plain and the works of it once were. But the prophecy of the con&s;lagration, like other
<PB N="42" REF="032007_0066_0FF33B5CD19E0E38">prophecies, may have different periods of ful|filment, one at the beginning, the other at the conclu&s;ion of the Millennium.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">When John had a vi&s;ion of the final judgment, (Rev. xx. 11 to 15) he &s;ays, 'I &s;aw a great white throne and him that &s;at on it, from who&s;e face the earth and the heaven fled away; and there was no place found for them. Then probably Chri&s;t will appear in &s;uch maje&s;ty and glory as never &s;hall have been &s;een before. Of that glory this attending his per&s;onal coming may be viewed as a prerepre&s;entation.</NOTE></P>
<P>Dr. Hopkins and &s;everal others have ob|&s;erved and proved, that Ezekiel's prophecy of Gog and Magog has two periods of ac|compli&s;hment; the fir&s;t introducing, and the other concluding the Millennium. Now that the fir&s;t Gog and Magog will be de&s;troyed by fire, is evident not only from Ezek. xxxviii. 22, but from the <HI>time</HI> of their de&s;truction be|ing that in which the Millennium &s;hall com|mence, and then, as already &s;hewn, Chri&s;t will appear in flaming &s;ire, taking vengeance. It is al&s;o very evident from Rev. xx. 9, that the la&s;t Gog and Magog will be devoured by &s;ire. Therefore, as there will be two Gogs at two different periods; &s;o there will be two fires at two different periods to devour them. The fir&s;t fire, a partial; the la&s;t, a complete fulfilment of the above &s;olemn pre|diction. The &s;ame prophecy we find in Mal. iv. 1. 'Behold, the day cometh which &s;hall burn as an oven, and all the proud, and all they who do wickedly, &s;hall be as &s;tubble.' Nothing could appear merely in the&s;e words, when fir&s;t written, to &s;how that they ever would have more than one period of accom|pli&s;hment;
<PB N="43" REF="032007_0067_0FF09F0000F51248">yet the oppo&s;ite is maintained by the mo&s;t approved expo&s;itors. This text was undoubtedly fulfilled in part when the Jew|i&s;h polity and di&s;pen&s;ation were de&s;troyed; but now, when the Millennium &s;hall com|mence, it will be accompli&s;hed far more ex|ten&s;ively, and at the la&s;t period its fulfilment will be complete.</P>
<P>That then next conflagration will not be univer&s;al, appears by Sect. I. which implies the continued propagation of mankind in the Millennium, i. e. after the world &s;hall have been de&s;troyed by fire. Now, if that fire &s;hould be univer&s;al, how will any part of our &s;pecies be pre&s;erved unle&s;s by a miracle? But the &s;cripture &s;peaks of no pre&s;erving miracle in that day, but that which &s;hall change the &s;aints, tran&s;mit them to the clouds and to im|mortality, in which &s;tate they neither marry nor are given in marriage; but are as the angels of God in heaven.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">That God and Magog will be the degenerate po&s;terity of other and a very &s;ordid repre&s;entation of their condition.</NOTE> It is mo&s;t ra|tional therefore to &s;uppo&s;e, that a part of our &s;pecies will be pre&s;erved without a mira|cle, and con&s;equently that the fire will not be univer&s;al. And does not the &s;cripture clearly foretel &s;uch a pre&s;ervation, and that not of one or two families, but of whole na|tions?</P>
<P>When Peter had fini&s;hed his de&s;cription of the con&s;lagration, he adds, 'Neverthele&s;s we, <HI>according to his promi&s;e,</HI> look for new heav|ens

Therefore no doubt the apo&s;tle Peter and the prophet I&s;aiah both &s;peak of the &s;ame new earth,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">With perhaps this difference, this prophecy of I&s;aiah <HI>may have</HI> an a&s;pect to the new and more happy &s;tate of civil &s;ociety occa|&s;ioned by our go&s;pel, as a figure of the real new earth &s;o plainly predicted by the apo&s;tle Peter.</NOTE> and con&s;equently of the &s;ame fire as that which &s;hall immediately precede and be the occa&s;ion of it. The prophet having de&s;crib|ed the ble&s;&s;ings of the new earth, proceeds to tell how they &s;hall be introduced: 'For behold the Lord will come with fire, and with his chariots, like a whirlwind, to render his anger with fury, and his rebuke with flames of fire.' I&s;a. lxvi. 15. This text, as appears by the connexion, was fulfilled only in the type by the fir&s;t per&s;onal coming of Chri&s;t, and the con&s;equent ruin of the Jews. The far more &s;olemn and exten&s;ive fulfilment is yet future, when the Chri&s;tian di&s;pen&s;ation and world &s;hall be fini&s;hed, and as much of the globe as the &s;cripture terms <HI>the whole earth,</HI> and <HI>the whole world,</HI> will be de&s;troyed by real fire from heaven. 'For by fire and by his &s;word will the Lord plead with <HI>all fle&s;h;</HI>' ver&s;e 16. Yet not <HI>all</HI> in the unlimited &s;en&s;e; for ob&s;erve what follows.

This was fulfilled in the type, when tho&s;e who e&s;caped the Jewi&s;h de&s;truction pro|pagated the go&s;pel among the nations; and as the be&s;t commentators allow that the pre|dictions in general of this chapter have a &s;econdary a&s;pect to a period yet future, what rea&s;on, which would not beg the que&s;tion, can be offered why this pa&s;&s;age, as well as the re&s;t, may not look to the &s;ame future pe|riod? Tar&s;hi&s;h, Pul, and other nations here mentioned, were Pagans, unacquainted with the Jewi&s;h go&s;pel; but when the Jewi&s;h economy and nation were de&s;troyed, a brighter go&s;pel &s;hone upon the&s;e nations than was ever enjoyed before.</P>
<P>And there are nations now on the globe which we may venture to call the antitype of Tar&s;hi&s;h, Pul and Lud. They are Pagans, unacquainted with our go&s;pel, &s;o have a re|lation to us &s;imilar to that which we once had to the Jews. And when our economy and world &s;hall be de&s;troyed, then will be their time of love. Then the i&s;les afar off, New Holland, New Guinea, Otaheite, Owhy|hee, and other dark regions, which have not heard God's fame, nor &s;een his glory, &s;hall enjoy a far brighter glory than was ever en|joyed before.

So in the end of our Chri&s;tian world, the wicked will be &s;ev|ered from the ju&s;t, and ca&s;t into a furnace of fire, and the next world, as pre&s;ently may appear more clearly, will be filled with &s;uch go&s;pel glory as never was enjoyed be|fore. Behold here the wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s of God! That part of the human race, who wait longe&s;t for the go&s;pel, enjoy its bright|e&s;t glory, when it appears.

Our knowledge, and con&s;equently our guilt, is far greater than that of the Jews. In my&s;tical Babylon will be found the blood of all tho&s;e who were &s;lain upon the earth. The Chri&s;tians have &s;lain many more &s;aints than the Jews. And in&s;tead of pitying the heathen, and exerting our utmo&s;t to illuminate them and diffu&s;e the pure go&s;pel among them; we have cheat|ed and robbed them, en&s;laved and murdered them.

<HEAD><HI>SECTION IV.</HI> The Millennium introduced by the Corporeal Re&s;|urrection of the Saints.</HEAD>
<P>NO part of &s;cripture more clearly de&s;cribes the Millennium, its manner of beginning and ending, than the xxth. of Revelation. Here the plain account is, that One, having the key of hell and of death, will <HI>come down</HI> from heaven, free the nations from deception, and rai&s;e the &s;aints from the dead, who &s;hall reign with Chri&s;t on the earth a thou&s;and years; that the re&s;t of the dead &s;hall not live again till the thou&s;and years are fini&s;hed, and then will follow the general re&s;urrection and judg|ment; all which is very plain and intelligi|ble on the truth of the &s;cheme under pre&s;ent inquiry. But on the truth of the contrary, the chapter is exceedingly difficult to under|&s;tand. We find, by ver&s;e 4th. this happy pe|riod introduced by the re&s;urrection of the &s;aints. 'I &s;aw thrones, and they &s;at upon them, and judgment was given unto them. And I &s;aw the &s;ouls of them who, were be|headed for the witne&s;s of Je&s;us and for the word of God, and who had not wor&s;hipped the bea&s;t, neither his image, neither had re|ceived his mark upon their foreheads nor in their hands, and they lived and reigned with Chri&s;t a thou&s;and years.' That this fir&s;t re&s;|urrection is not figurative, but literal, may appear by the following arguments.</P>

1. In whatever &s;en&s;e we under&s;tand this chapter, whether literally or allegorically, it is certain here is no account of two &s;orts of death and re&s;urrection, in tho&s;e ver&s;es which <HI>expre&s;sly</HI> mention a re&s;urrection, as &s;o many have imagined; but the plain repre&s;entation is, that two &s;orts of <HI>per&s;ons,</HI> who were dead in the &s;ame &s;en&s;e, &s;hould revive at two differ|ent periods of time. This mu&s;t appear to any one who properly and attentively con&s;id|ers this phra&s;e, <HI>'the re&s;t of the dead.'</HI> If this pa&s;&s;age is con&s;trued to &s;ignify two &s;orts of death and re&s;urrection, the nece&s;&s;ary para|phra&s;e would be wor&s;e than tautology. <HI>I &s;aw tho&s;e who had the temper of the martyrs, and they received this temper of mind and reign|ed in a &s;uffering &s;tate a thou&s;and years; that is, &s;ome reigned twenty, others forty, &s;ixty or an hundred years, till the thou&s;and were expired. But</HI> the re&s;t <HI>of the dead, con&s;i&s;ting of</HI> both &s;orts, <HI>lived not again until the thou&s;and years were fulfilled.</HI> The above con&s;truction cannot admit of a better paraphra&s;e, and is it not quite unintelligible?<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the time of the American war there were once in the ho&s;pital at Cambridge, about forty &s;ick per&s;ons.

<P>But &s;ome, expo&s;itors, who appear &s;en&s;ible of this difficulty, have recour&s;e to another in|vention in order to turn this plain and ea&s;y account of the re&s;urrection into allegory. The martyrs, they &s;ay, will live again in the revival and flouri&s;hing of that cau&s;e which they e&s;pou&s;ed, and which had been a long time dead among a world of enemies, who
<PB N="55" REF="032007_0079_0FF09F1406089610">will now die in their turn, in that their cau&s;e will die: For Satan will now deceive the nations no more for a thou&s;and years: and then he will deceive again, and &s;o the&s;e old enemies of religion will live again in the revival of their cau&s;e, while the martyrs in heaven will die again in their cau&s;e: Briefly, the righteous and the wicked will live and die by turns. As if John had &s;aid, <HI>I &s;aw the &s;ouls of them who were beheaded, and they revived in that their cau&s;e revived. I &s;aw thrones and they &s;at upon them in that their cau&s;e &s;at upon them; but the re&s;t of tho&s;e who were dead, with re&s;pect to an oppo&s;ite cau&s;e, lived not again in that cau&s;e till the thou&s;and years were fini&s;hed.</HI> But here is not all the difficulty. What a needle&s;s repetition does this com|ment fix on this part of the chapter! What is the expul&s;ion of darkne&s;s, but the effu&s;ion of light? and what is the ligation of Satan and undeceiving of the nations, in ver&s;e 1 to 3, but the revival of the martyrs' cau&s;e? If &s;o, the account of the re&s;urrection in ver&s;e 4th. tells nothing more than what was ju&s;t told us before. The preceding ver&s;es declare plainly that the martyrs &s;hall revive in their cau&s;e, i. e. that their cau&s;e &s;hall revive; and the 4th. ver&s;e only repeats the &s;ame thing in another manner. Now it is u&s;ual for the word of prophecy to repre&s;ent the &s;ame thing differently in different vi&s;ions; but where do we find different repre&s;enta|tions of the &s;ame event in the &s;ame vi&s;ion
<PB N="56" REF="032007_0080_0FF09EFCEFBDAA18">and almo&s;t in the &s;ame ver&s;e? Be&s;ides, how unin&s;tructive is the text rendered by this comment! If the cau&s;e of the righteous flouri&s;hes and triumphs over all a thou|&s;and years, what per&s;on need be told that the cau&s;e of the wicked will <HI>not</HI> flouri&s;h for that thou&s;and years? Again, If the fir&s;t re&s;urrection be only the revival of the martyrs in their cau&s;e; then the revival of the wicked in their cau&s;e after the Millen|nium, by the loa&s;ing of Satan, will be the <HI>&s;econd</HI> re&s;urrection. Why then does not the chapter call it a re&s;urrection, as well as the other, the &s;ame &s;ubject being continued? Why was this omi&s;&s;ion? why this &s;udden, unnatural tran&s;ition from one kind of alle|gory to another? Such a mon&s;ter in lan|guage &s;hould never be imputed to the &s;crip|ture without &s;ome better rea&s;on than merely the vindication of that hypothe&s;is, which puts the coming of Chri&s;t far off. It may be ar|gued that the fir&s;t re&s;urrection mu&s;t be figur|ative, becau&s;e it is here &s;aid that the <HI>&s;ouls</HI> of tho&s;e, who were beheaded, lived; not their bodies. But how often do the &s;crip|tures &s;peak by a &s;ynedoche like this! 'Every living &s;oul died in the &s;ea,' means that every living body died in the &s;en. Chri&s;t's '<HI>&s;oul</HI> was not left in hell:' His body was not left in the grave. 'O let me e&s;cape thither,' &s;ays Lot, 'and <HI>my &s;oul</HI> &s;hall live:' My body &s;hall live. And thus the &s;ouls of the martyrs liv|ed, i. e. their bodies lived again. There|fore
<PB N="57" REF="032007_0081_0FF09F018A13D580">this pa&s;&s;age mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily mean that two &s;orts of per&s;ons, righteous and wicked, who were dead in the &s;ame &s;en&s;e and at the &s;ame time, revived at two different periods. The righteous fir&s;t and the re&s;t after many days, even a thou&s;and years. Accordingly the prophet I&s;aiah, predicting this very time, tells us, (chap. xxiv. 21, 22, 23) that the Lord 'will puni&s;h the ho&s;ts of the high ones, which are on high, and the kings of the earth upon the earth, and they &s;hall be gathered together as pri&s;oners are gathered in the pit, and be &s;hut up in pri&s;on, and after <HI>many days</HI> &s;hall they be vi&s;ited.' That <HI>then</HI> the moon &s;hall be con|founded and the &s;un a&s;hamed, when the Lord &s;hall reign in mount Zion and in Jeru&s;alem and before his ancients gloriou&s;ly.' Jeru&s;a|lem which is above &s;hall come down; the ancient prophets and &s;aints will de&s;cend from heaven, a&s;&s;ume their bodies, and Chri&s;t will reign before them gloriou&s;ly in mount Zion and Jeru&s;alem: that is, in New Jeru&s;alem, the true glorified church collected from all preceding ages.</P>
<P N="2">2. It is allowed by all, that the &s;econd event, which this chapter calls a re&s;urrection, mu&s;t be under&s;tood literally. Therefore, other things being aqual, the fir&s;t mu&s;t be under&s;tood &s;o too. That the account of Sa|tan's being bound and loo&s;ed is figurative, is freely granted, and the figure appears at fir&s;t view; but this is no proof that the account of the fir&s;t re&s;urrection is figurative where
<PB N="58" REF="032007_0082_0FF09EDEC17277D8">the contrary appears at fir&s;t view. If this ac|count be an allegory, as &s;o many imagine; then the other re&s;urrection, in the conclu|&s;ion of the chapter, is entirely another &s;ub|ject, and has no very immediate relation to any preceding part of the chapter. But if we can allow the account of the fir&s;t re&s;ur|rection to mean as it &s;peaks, a plain and im|mediate relation appears between one part of the chapter and the other, and an ea&s;y, beau|tiful connexion, both of the &s;tyle and &s;ubject, is con&s;picuous through the whole.</P>
<P N="3">3. It will not be denied, that one great de&s;ign of this chapter and of this whole proph|ecy, was to &s;upport and comfort the church under her &s;ore trials of Pagan and Popi&s;h per|&s;ecutions. Now this great de&s;ign is certainly mo&s;t favoured by the explanation for which this &s;ection is pleading: It could not be &s;o comfortable to the martyrs, when they were going to the &s;take, to believe that only their cau&s;e would revive, as to believe that both they and their cau&s;e would revive together. The martyrs have here a precious promi&s;e that, if they will lo&s;e their lives for Chri&s;t's &s;ake, they &s;hall &s;ave them; that, if they will &s;uffer for Chri&s;t, they &s;hall reign with him. If they will die faithfully, they &s;hall live again and reign gloriou&s;ly. And accordingly we are told in hi&s;tory, that a multitude of mar|tyrs under&s;tood this promi&s;e literally, and were greatly comforted by it. And here we may &s;ee how unrea&s;onably &s;ome expo&s;itors
<PB N="59" REF="032007_0083_0FF09F0334BCCF08">have u&s;ed the promi&s;e of Elias, the manner of its fulfilment, as a key to this prophecy, by &s;aying that John had the &s;pirit of Elias. The ca&s;e of that prophet, and that of the martyrs were very di&s;&s;imilar. The promi&s;e of Elias was a promi&s;e to the Jews; not to that proph|et him&s;elf: for he had a&s;cended to heaven long before it was revealed. But the fir&s;t re&s;urrection was a promi&s;e, not only to the church in general, but to the martyrs of Je&s;us in particular, who have been chiefly born &s;ince this promi&s;e was revealed, and who &s;tood in peculiar need of &s;uch a clear and &s;pecial manife&s;tation of divine love, as the literal &s;en&s;e of this promi&s;e affords.</P>
<P N="4">4. The &s;ame literal &s;en&s;e is confirmed by &s;everal other pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture. In I&s;a. xxiv. to xxvi. the re&s;urrection of the &s;aints is evi|dently mentioned as one of tho&s;e happy events which &s;hall con&s;titute the glory of the Millennium. Tho&s;e chapter declare, that when 'the Lord &s;hall make unto all people a fea&s;t of fat things, and &s;hall de&s;troy the veil which is &s;pread over all nations, he will &s;wallow up death in victory.' And that this victory is not figurative, but literal, ap|pears from the apo&s;tle's quoting this pa&s;&s;age, and expre&s;sly declaring that it will be ful|filled in the corporeal re&s;urrection of the &s;aints. 1 Cor. xv. 54. <HI>Then</HI> &s;hall be brought to pa&s;s the &s;aying that is written, 'Death is &s;wallowed up in victory.' And when Paul &s;peaks of the re&s;urrection of
<PB N="60" REF="032007_0084_0FF09EE04DE22748">Chri&s;t as a proof of ours, he has doubtle&s;s in view that in I&s;a. xxvi. 19. 'Thy dead men &s;hall live, together with my dead <HI>body</HI> &s;hall they ari&s;e. Awake! and &s;ing, ye who dwell in du&s;t! for thy dew is as the dew of herbs, and the earth &s;hall ca&s;t out her dead.' And the &s;ame prophecy declares, that the wicked &s;hall <HI>not</HI> then be rai&s;ed: 'O Lord, other lords be&s;ides thee have had dominion over us. They are dead, they &s;hall not live: they are decea&s;ed, they &s;hall not ri&s;e.' I&s;a. xxvi. 13, 14. That is, they &s;hall not ri&s;e <HI>at pre&s;ent:</HI> for 'they &s;hall be &s;hut up in pri&s;on, and after <HI>many days</HI> &s;hall they be vi&s;ited.'<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This explanation is not new. This prophecy of I&s;aiah was under&s;tood in the &s;ame light by a number of ancient expo&s;itors, both Jews and Chri&s;tians.&mdash;<HI>See Mather's Di&s;&s;ertation, p.</HI> 16.</NOTE> Chap. xxiv. 22. In chap. xxxv. which predicts the Millennium, we read that 'the ran&s;omed of the Lord (from the grave) &s;hall return and come to Zion with &s;ongs, and everla&s;ting joy &s;hall be upon their heads: they &s;hall obtain joy and gladne&s;s, and &s;orrow and &s;ighing &s;hall flee away.' But &s;orrow and &s;ighing will not flee away till the re&s;urrection. And in chap. lxvi. 14, the prophet, foretelling the &s;ame future glory, declares, that when the &s;aints &s;hall &s;ee it, not only will their hearts rejoice, but their <HI>bones</HI> al&s;o '&s;hall flouri&s;h like an herb.'</P>
<P>The departed &s;aints are perfectly holy and much more happy than they were on earth; but &s;till the marks of God's di&s;plea&s;ure for

'The Lord hath put away thy &s;in,' &s;ays Nathan to David, 'but the child &s;hall die, and the &s;word &s;hall not de|part from thy hou&s;e.' The &s;ad con&s;equence of &s;in, which &s;erves to keep it in memory, &s;hall yet continue with you. Such is the ca&s;e of every departed &s;aint: his &s;in is forgiven, but not wholly blotted out; and &s;uch his ca&s;e will continue till the re&s;urrection, by which all the marks of God's di&s;plea&s;ure for &s;in will be wiped off from his people forever. Hence we have that in Acts iii. 19.&mdash;21. 'Re|pent and be converted that your &s;ins may be blotted out:' When? 'When the times of refre&s;hing &s;hall come from the pre&s;ence of the Lord: And he &s;hall &s;end Je&s;us, which before was preached unto you, whom the heavens mu&s;t receive till the times of the re&s;|titution of all things.'</P>
<P>The&s;e pa&s;&s;ages afford much confirming evi|dence, that there will be a bodily re&s;urrection in the Millennium, and that the dead in Chri&s;t will ri&s;e long before the wicked. And why this &s;lowne&s;s of heart to receive the&s;e com|forts, which the prophets have &s;poken? Would &s;uch a di&s;tinction be &s;trange or new? We have no account in &s;cripture that any wicked man ever yet ro&s;e from the dead; but many of the &s;aints have ri&s;en already; why then &s;hould it be thought a thing incredible that many more &s;aints may ri&s;e long before the re&s;urrection of the wicked?</P>

'The man clothed in linen, which was upon the waters of the river, held up his his right hand and his left hand to heaven, and &s;ware by Him who liveth forever, that it &s;hall be for a time, times and an half, and when he (the vile per&s;on) &s;hall have accom|pli&s;hed to &s;catter the power of the holy peo|ple, all the&s;e things &s;hall be fini&s;hed.' Parallel to this was the vi&s;ion of John, Rev. x. 5 to 7. 'And the angel which I &s;aw &s;tand upon the &s;ea and upon the earth, lifted up his hand to heaven, and &s;ware by Him who liveth for|ever and ever, that time &s;hall be no longer.' But in the days of the voice of the &s;eventh angel, when he &s;hall begin to &s;ound, the my&s;tery of God &s;hall be fini&s;hed, as he hath &s;poken to his &s;ervants the <HI>prophets;</HI>' and to the prophet Daniel among the re&s;t. According|ly, when the &s;eventh angel &s;hall &s;ound, 'God will judge the dead, and give reward unto his &s;ervants the prophets, to the &s;aints and to them who fear his name, both &s;mall and great.' And what can this reward be, but Daniel's lot, and the recompen&s;e which Chri&s;t has promi&s;ed to the charitable 'at the re&s;ur|rection of the ju&s;t?' And that this judgment and reward will be at the <HI>beginning,</HI> as well as at the conclu&s;ion of the Millennium, appears by carefully con&s;idering, that when 'the &s;eventh angel &s;hall <HI>begin</HI> to &s;ound, time &s;hall be no longer, and the my&s;tery of God &s;hall be fini&s;hed.

<P>To what has now been offered, there are &s;ome objections worthy of particular notice.</P>
<P N="1">1. When our Lord was examined by the high prie&s;t whether he was the Son of God, 'Je&s;us &s;aith unto him, Thou ha&s;t &s;aid; nev|erthele&s;s, I &s;ay unto you, hereafter &s;hall ye &s;ee the Son of Man &s;itting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heav|en.'

How then will he &s;ee the Son of Man coming in the clouds of heaven?</HI> To which it may be replied, that, be&s;ides the impo&s;&s;ibil|ity of knowing the high prie&s;t's character when he died, and that of others pre&s;ent at this examination; it &s;hould be carefully no|ted that only the fir&s;t part of this wer&s;e &s;eems to have been addre&s;&s;ed to the high prie&s;t <HI>in particular:</HI> the latter part &s;eems to be ad|dre&s;&s;ed to the Jews as a nation.

<P N="2">2. If there &s;hould be a re&s;urrection before the de&s;truction of the globe, how is it true that 'Man lieth down and ri&s;eth not again till the heavens be no more?' Job xiv. 12. The an&s;wer is,

<ITEM>3. Suppo&s;e any of the Jews in Old Te&s;tament times had been of opinion that there would be a bodily re&s;|urrection of <HI>many</HI> &s;aints at the end of their di&s;|pen&s;ation, and con&s;equently before the final ruin of the globe;</ITEM>
</LIST> this objection would have been as forcible again&s;t that opinion, as it is now again&s;t the opinion that many more &s;aints will ri&s;e at the end of our di&s;pen&s;ation. So when Chri&s;t declared, John v. 28, 29, 'The hour is coming when <HI>all</HI> that are in their graves &s;hall hear his voice, and come forth,' his words would <HI>then</HI> as fairly have proved that no &s;aint would ri&s;e when he aro&s;e; as they will now prove that no &s;aint will ri&s;e at the time of the fir&s;t re&s;urrection. The word <HI>hour</HI> is &s;ometimes u&s;ed for time in|definitely. The ten horns received power as

<P>The objection taken from Matt. xxv. 30 to 46 mu&s;t vani&s;h, when it is con&s;idered that it does not there appear to have been our Saviour's de&s;ign to mea&s;ure periods, but only in general to &s;how what a &s;olemn di&s;tinction between the righteous and the wicked will be the con&s;equence of his &s;econd coming. We &s;hould al&s;o remember, that 'one day is with the Lord as a thou&s;and years, and a thou&s;and years as one day.'</P>
<P>When we read too that in Dan. xii. 2, it &s;eems as if all would be rai&s;ed at the &s;ame time. 'And many of them who &s;leep in the du&s;t of the earth &s;hall awake, &s;ome to ever|la&s;ting life, and &s;ome to &s;hame and everla&s;t|ing contempt.' But even here the revival of the righteous is mentioned fir&s;t, as it is in every other text where both are mentioned together, which affords prevailing evidence that the re&s;urrection of the righteous will be fir&s;t in the order of time. But how long fir&s;t? Daniel's prophecy here does not &s;ay; but the Revelation &s;ays it will be a whole day fir&s;t: and the Revelation is exegetical of the book of Daniel.

<P>INFERENCES.</P>
<P N="1">1. Hence it appears that the Millennium is yet future. There has been no corporeal re&s;urrection &s;ince this prophecy was revealed. The capture of Con&s;tantinople by Mahomet the Second, in the year 1453, with the con|&s;equent ruin of the Greek empire, has ap|peared to &s;ome expo&s;itors like Satan let loo&s;e to deceive the nations. Hence their Millen|nium begins in the year 453. But what was the condition and behaviour of mankind in that intermediate time? Are they di&s;tingui&s;h|ed in genuine hi&s;tory from other ages by knowledge, piety, peace and happine&s;s? Noth|ing more remote. Who without pain can read the mi&s;eries of our fellow creatures in the fifth and &s;ixth centuries by the fall of the we&s;tern empire, when the Barbarians, with|out compa&s;&s;ion to age or &s;ex, carried fire and &s;word, ma&s;&s;acre and de&s;peration among the people wherever they went? What va&s;t de&s;olation afflicted the world in the &s;eventh and eighth centuries, by the conque&s;t of the Saracens extending far and wide; from It|aly to the river Niger, in Africa; from Por|tugal
<PB N="68" REF="032007_0092_0FF09EED30BF4750">to the remote&s;t Indies. Before them was the garden of the Lord; behind them a de&s;olate wilderne&s;s. And what were the ninth, tenth and eleventh centuries, but the midnight of Popi&s;h delu&s;ion? Then, if ever, the man of &s;in &s;at in the temple of God, and the hou&s;e of prayer became a den of thieves. The twelfth, thirteenth and four|teenth centuries are well known to be di&s;tin|gui&s;hed by the mo&s;t exten&s;ive and bloody per&s;ecutions of the Petrobru&s;&s;ians, Walden&s;es, and Lollards, that ever di&s;graced the human nature. "It is enough to make the blood run cold to read of the horrid murders and deva&s;tations of the&s;e times! how many poor innocent Chri&s;tians were &s;acrificed to the blind fury and malice of their enemies! It is computed that in France alone were &s;lain a million." While the &s;word of the fierce Othman (horrid argument) was propagating a fal&s;e religion by pouring blood and deva&s;|tation through the ea&s;tern empire. What melancholy ages were the&s;e! What kind of reign upon earth had the &s;aints in this dread|ful Millennium! And what matter of won|der it is, than men eminent for knowledge in divinity and hi&s;tory, &s;hould ever attempt to vindicate this hypothe&s;is! A clear manife&s;ta|tion how nece&s;&s;ary it is that the mind &s;hould be influenced, not by great names, but great arguments, in all our inquiries for the mean|ing of prophecy, as well as every other part of the &s;acred &s;criptures.</P>

2. The fir&s;t re&s;urrection will not be merely that of the martyrs, as &s;ome have &s;up|po&s;ed, but of others who have not wor&s;hipped the bea&s;t. The propriety of mentioning the martyrs here <HI>expre&s;sly</HI> is ea&s;y to be &s;een. Other &s;aints in general are not in &s;uch pecu|liar need of comfort from this promi&s;e as the martyrs were. And perhaps too the reign of the martyrs will be, in &s;ome re&s;pects, more glorious than that of mo&s;t other &s;aints. But there is evidence that many and perhaps all the &s;aints who &s;hall then have lived, will have a part in the fir&s;t re&s;urrection: for then Chri&s;t will appear in the clouds, as already &s;hewn; and 'When Chri&s;t, who is our life, &s;hall ap|pear,' &s;ays Paul, 'then &s;hall <HI>ye</HI> al&s;o appear with him in glory;' that is, in a &s;tate of glory in the clouds; 'and &s;o &s;hall we ever be with the Lord.' Chri&s;t will come with all his &s;aints; 'He will then &s;end his angels with a great &s;ound of a trumpet, and they &s;hall gather together his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.' Matt. xxiv. 31. And when Paul treats of the fir&s;t re&s;urrection, he &s;ays, 'We &s;hall <HI>all</HI> be changed in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the la&s;t trump (for the trumpet &s;hall &s;ound) and the dead &s;hall be rai&s;ed incorrupt|ible, and we &s;hall be changed.'</P>
<P>But when we con&s;ider how numerous mankind will be in the Millennium, it may may be a&s;ked, How will there be room on the globe for &s;uch a multitude of glo|rified
<PB N="70" REF="032007_0094_0FF09EE1EDFEEED0">bodies? But he who is able to rai&s;e the&s;e bodies is doubtle&s;s able to find room for them. Many of them may be employed alter|nately in other parts of the univer&s;e, and open &s;uch opulent &s;ources of communication from the numerous i&s;lands of the ethereal ocean, as will cau&s;e the next di&s;pen&s;ation as much to exceed the pre&s;ent with re&s;pect to knowledge, as the pre&s;ent exceeds the former.

More|over, he who can rai&s;e the dead, can &s;ay to the deep, Be dry. Though the prophecy of the new earth has ultimate reference to that mo&s;t glorious &s;tate of the church which &s;hall &s;ucceed the Millennium; yet many of the be&s;t commentators allow, it will be fulfilled in part when that happy period &s;hall corn|mence. Therefore that in Hag. ii. 6, and Rev. xxi. 1, may is part be fulfilled literally, as well as my&s;tically, for any thing which yet appears to the contrary. And if only one third part of the &s;ea &s;hould become land, it would furni&s;h nearly as much room for in|habitants as there now is on the whole &s;ur|face of the globe.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">To what purpo&s;e are all the arguments from the laws of nature in oppo&s;ition to the doctrine of the n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">w earth, unle&s;s our philo&s;ophers could know what the lave, of the new nature of the new earth &s;hall be.</NOTE></P>

3. Hence it appears agreeable to the ultimate de&s;ign of this whole chapter, that the Millen|nium will be a third general di&s;pen&s;ation of grace, a new order of things with re&s;pect to the church militant, as di&s;tinct from the pre&s;|ent, as the pre&s;ent is from that of the Jews. It has now been &s;hewn, that the fir&s;t re&s;ur|rection will be attended with Chri&s;t's per&s;onal appearance in flaming fire, and the inference is nece&s;&s;ary that there will be a miraculous manife&s;tation of things which were never be|fore exhibited to the world. But more will be offered to confirm this in the next chapter.</P>
<P N="4">4. Hence it is probable, that the thou&s;and years will only be literally &s;uch. The fir&s;t and &s;econd re&s;urrection, with the chapter in general, have a literal meaning, as already has been &s;hewn. Therefore the thou&s;and years, other things being equal, mu&s;t be con|&s;idered as having the &s;ame acceptation. Three hundred and &s;ixty-five thou&s;and years are out of all proportion, as Dr. Hopkins has ju&s;tly ob&s;erved.</P>
<P>The week of days and the week of years, among the Jews, are allowed to be analogous to the duration of the globe; but the &s;eventh day is no longer than any other day of the week.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t di&s;pen&s;ation continued four thou|&s;and years; the &s;econd two thou&s;and nearly. Therefore the third di&s;pen&s;ation, continuing only one thou&s;and years, has the &s;ame pro|portion to the &s;econd as the &s;econd has to the fir&s;t: As two are to four, &s;o is one to two.</P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="032007_0096_0FF09EF7230CABE8">
In that day it is allowed, that the imper|fect &s;aints will have far greater degrees of holine&s;s than the imperfect &s;aints have at pre&s;ent, or ever had heretofore. And there|fore &s;in and its con&s;equences will appear far more dreadful to them than they appear now to us. And hence their de&s;ires and prayers will be earne&s;t for that far more glorious &s;tate of the church beyond them, in which the prediction of the new heavens and earth will have its complete accompli&s;hment, and in which the whole church, collected from all ages and nations, &s;hall appear without &s;pot or wrinkle; &s;in, &s;orrow and death being en|tirely bani&s;hed forever.</P>
<P>The&s;e con&s;iderations mu&s;t afford &s;ome de|gree of evidence that the Millennium, though a very bright and glorious day, will not con|tinue, and that it is not a thing de&s;irable, on the whole, that it &s;hould continue longer than literally a thou&s;and years.</P>
<P>When any particular &s;aint enjoys the lively exerci&s;e of grace, he is far more happy than he was before; yet he forgets the things which are behind, and the future perfect day is more earne&s;tly de&s;ired than cover: So it will be with the church militant in the Millenni|um. Her de&s;ires for the perfect day will be more earne&s;t than ever before in any former age. Therefore, comparing future time with the pa&s;t, it does not appear rational to imag|ine that three hundred and &s;ixty-five thou|&s;and years will be &s;uffered to elap&s;e before the&s;e earne&s;t de&s;ires &s;hall be gratified.</P>

<P N="1">1. The di&s;tinction between the pre&s;ent and former di&s;pen&s;ation, chiefly con&s;i&s;ts in our having a new and more glorious revela|tion, which abrogates the old po&s;itive in&s;titu|tions; and, be&s;ides affording new di&s;coveries,

As much di&s;tinction and a &s;imilar one there will be, we may rationally &s;uppo&s;e, between our di&s;pen&s;ation and the Millennium: for it is not improbable that our po&s;itive in|&s;titutions will be then aboli&s;hed: We have not the lea&s;t evidence that bapti&s;m will con|tinue longer than to the end of <HI>this</HI> world. Matt. xxviii. 20. Nor that the Lord's Sup|per will continue any longer than till the coming of Chri&s;t. 1 Cor. xi. 26. And what nece&s;&s;ity will there be of &s;uch a token to keep in memory an ab&s;ent Friend when he &s;hall be pre&s;ent?</P>
<P N="2">2. It will not he denied that &s;everal an|cient prophecies do, in the &s;ame &s;entences, predict both the pre&s;ent di&s;pen&s;ation and the Millennium, and the former as the type of the latter. And the propriety of viewing them in this light plainly appears by pre|lim. 4. Tho&s;e prophecies could afford no more evidence to the Jews that their di&s;pen|&s;ation would be &s;ucceeded by another, than they now afford that our di&s;pen&s;ation will be &s;ucceeded by another. We have &s;een what their fulfilment was in the type, and hence may infer that their fulfilment will be &s;imilar in the antitype.</P>
<P N="3">3. Under the Jewi&s;h economy the ark of the te&s;tament was placed in the inner taber|nacle, <HI>never to be &s;een</HI> by any one, except the high prie&s;t, through that di&s;pen&s;ation. 'The Holy Gho&s;t this &s;ignifying,' &s;ays Paul, 'that

Therefore, to open or make manife&s;t the way into the holy of holies, and con&s;equently to bring the ark of the te&s;tament into view, required a new di&s;|pen&s;ation. Heb. ix. 1&mdash;10. Hence it ap|pears, that for any prophet to predict that the ark of the te&s;tament <HI>&s;hall be &s;een,</HI> is im|plicitly the &s;ame as to predict a new di&s;pen&s;a|tion. But when the &s;eventh angel &s;ounded, there were great voices in heaven, &s;aying, 'The kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord and of his Chri&s;t. And the temple of God was opened in heav|en; <HI>and there was &s;een</HI> in his temple the ark of his te&s;tament.'

And how will both the&s;e now be perfectly under&s;tood without the third volume at his &s;econd coming? What a large and valuable portion of &s;cripture is yet under a veil, which the mo&s;t elaborate, ingenious and learned commentaries have never taken off!

<P>WHEN the apo&s;tle Peter had fini&s;hed his &s;olemn de&s;cription of the conflagration, he comforts believers with the promi&s;e of new heavens and a new earth. 2 Pet. iii. 13.

That word of prophecy, which is like &s;ilver &s;even times tried, is not only fulfilled in different periods, but &s;ometimes in different &s;en&s;es. 'The de&s;art &s;hall rejoice and blo&s;&s;om as the ro&s;e.' I&s;a. xxxv. 4. 'I will give&mdash;to thy &s;eed&mdash;the land of Canaan.' Gen. xvii. 8. The&s;e and &s;everal other pa&s;&s;ages &s;eem to have a literal as well as &s;piritual fulfillment. The &s;ame may be ob&s;erved of the fir&s;t prophecy after the apo&s;ta&s;y re&s;pecting the enmity between the &s;eed of the woman and the &s;eed of the &s;erpent: It is now as clearly fulfilled in the literal as in the &s;piritual &s;en&s;e. Therefore, if it were proved that the above promi&s;e of a new world has a &s;piritual a&s;pect, it would by no means follow that there will not be al&s;o a literal fulfilment of it.</P>
<P>As God is one, &s;o his works are one. A glorious uniformity of de&s;ign is con&s;picuous through the whole of them. It is a great beauty in the works of our Creator, that, amid&s;t all their variety, one &s;pecies, of created exi&s;tence repre&s;ents another, and one period of events repre&s;ents another. Hence <HI>the much in a little</HI> of the word of prophecy. Accord|ingly the pre&s;ent &s;tate of the natural world re&s;embles that of the moral. Now what great ab&s;urdity is there in &s;uppo&s;ing that the works of the &s;ame God will in future time be &s;imilar to what they have been in time
<PB N="80" REF="032007_0104_0FF09F23F05C8610">pa&s;t? that the future &s;tate of the moral world will be repre&s;ented by the future &s;tate of the natural? that as, by what has been proved, there will be a great miraculous change for the better in the moral world, &s;o there will be the like in the natural? Why is the renovation of the earth after its ruin any more incredible than the renovation of our own earth after the ruin of our bodies? Why then may not the above promi&s;e mean as it &s;peaks; e&s;pecially &s;ince it is a maxim with divines, that the literal &s;en&s;e &s;hould always be preferred to the figurative, when it does not oppo&s;e the analogy of faith.</P>
<P>It is proved that the former part of this chapter treats of a literal deluge and a literal conflagration. And now when it treats of a new earth, mu&s;t another &s;ubject pre&s;ent it|&s;elf to view all at once, or a mo&s;t unnatural tran&s;ition from the literal to the figurative? Certainly not without &s;ome better rea&s;on than the &s;upport of that hypothe&s;is, which has al|ready been &s;hewn to be erroneous.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"The general rule of interpretation is not to recede from the literal &s;en&s;e unle&s;s there be a nece&s;&s;ity from the &s;ubject matter.

I be &s;econd rule is the u&s;e of the &s;ame words in the con|text. Saint Peter had u&s;ed the &s;ame phra&s;e of heavens and earth twice before in the &s;ame chap <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">: The old heavens and earth, ver. 5; The pre&s;ent heavens and earth, ver&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">: and now he u&s;es it again, ver&s;e 13. The new heavens and earth. Have we not then rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e that he takes it here in the &s;ame &s;en&s;e that he had done twice before, for real, material heavens and earth? There is no mark &s;et of a new lignification, nor why were &s;hould alter the &s;en&s;e of the words. The very form of the words and the manner of their dependence up|on the context, lead us to a literal &s;en&s;e: 'Neverthele&s;s,' &s;ays the apo&s;tle, '<HI>we expect new heavens,</HI>' &amp;c. Why neverthele&s;s? i. e. notwith&s;tanding the di&s;&s;olution of the pre&s;ent heavens and earth. The apo&s;tle fore&s;aw that what he had &s;aid might rai&s;e a doubt in their minds whether all things would not be at an end; to obvi|ate this he tells them, <HI>notwith&s;tanding</HI> that wonderful de&s;olation that I have de&s;cribed, we do, according to God's promi&s;e, expect new heavens and a new earth.

<PB N="81" REF="032007_0105_0FF09F2C2B03D358">that the new earth only means the abun|dant righteou&s;ne&s;s of that day, is refuted by the very words of this promi&s;e, which plainly di&s;tingui&s;h the new earth from the righteou&s;|ne&s;s which &s;hall dwell in it. 'We look for new heavens and a new earth <HI>wherein dwell|eth</HI> righteou&s;ne&s;s.' So in I&s;a. lxvi. 22, the new heavens and earth are clearly di&s;tingui&s;hed from the church which &s;hall flouri&s;h in that day: 'As the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make, &s;hall remain before me, &s;o &s;hall <HI>your &s;eed and your name</HI> remain.' And in Rom. viii. 19, which by an emphati|cal pro&s;opopoeia repre&s;ents the whole creation as waiting and groaning for this renovation, the &s;ame di&s;tinction is manife&s;t. 'And not only <HI>they,</HI> but <HI>we our&s;elves</HI> al&s;o, groan within our&s;elves, waiting for the adoption, even the redemption of our body.'</P>
<P>The&s;e pa&s;&s;ages plead for the literal &s;en&s;e of this glorious prediction of the new heavens and earth. And how agreeable is this con|&s;truction to what is known to be God's man|ner of working both in the natural and moral
<PB N="82" REF="032007_0106_0FF097FA20562708">world. The mo&s;t &s;alubrious air, the cheer|fulle&s;t &s;un, the pure&s;t &s;ky, are often the im|mediate con&s;equence of the mo&s;t violent &s;torms. The pre&s;ent beautiful creation ro&s;e from chaos. And in the moral world the greate&s;t good often &s;ucceeds the greate&s;t evil. 'In the place where it was &s;aid, Ye are not my people, there &s;hall they be called, The children of the living God.' So this part of the creation which, is now &s;ubject to vanity and the cur&s;e, and re&s;erved unto fire again&s;t the day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men, it is not unrea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e, will thenceforward be the &s;ubject of re&s;titution and the mo&s;t glorious exhibitions of mercy. But, though the aerial heavens in that time may become much more &s;alutary and pro|ductive of longevity than ever before over all the globe, on which account, as well as on account of the new &s;tate of things in general, the whole globe may be &s;aid to be new; yet there is no difficulty in the hypothe&s;is that the next re&s;titution will be only partial, only the commencement of that which &s;hall be complete at the final judgment. The cur&s;e which afflicts the earth for man's &s;ake, &s;eems to have had two periods of fulfilment; the fir&s;t immediately after the apo&s;ta&s;y; the &s;ec|ond at the deluge.

<P><PB N="83" REF="032007_0107_0FF09F4550EDB1C8">
The new &s;piritual creation has two periods of accompli&s;hment: The fir&s;t, that of regen|eration; the &s;econd, that of perfection. And the human &s;oul in the intermediate time is the &s;ubject of the wide&s;t extremes. It has been proved too, that the prophecies of Gog and Magog&mdash;of the re&s;urrection and confla|gration &mdash;have yet two periods of accompli&s;h|ment.</P>
<P>When all the&s;e things are con&s;idered, we are not without evidence that there mu&s;t be a &s;econd period to fulfil all the happine&s;s pre|dicted of the new heavens and earth.</P>
<P>What this new earth will be, we know not any more than we know what our bodies will be; but doubtle&s;s a glorified earth will be a &s;uitable man&s;ion for glorified bodies, and con&s;equently for that New Jeru&s;alem which &s;hall come down from God out of heaven.</P>
<P>This new earth will be the land of I&s;rael, the antitype of Canaan, and a mo&s;t glorious fulfilment of the promi&s;e to Abraham, 'that he &s;hould be heir of the world through the righteou&s;ne&s;s of faith.' This will be the in|heritance of the meek, Matt. v. 5; and of tho&s;e children who obey their parents in the Lord, Eph. vi. 1&mdash;3, and thereby become the true children of Abraham. The apo&s;tle, to encourage the true obedience of children, in&s;tead of the type, pre&s;ents to their view the antitype; in&s;tead of &s;aying, 'Thy days &s;hall be long upon the land,' he &s;ays, 'Honour thy father and thy mother, which is the fir&s;t

Not the pre&s;ent earth: for here obedient children in general live no longer than others; but on the new earth, of which Abraham's &s;piritual children are heirs, and which is the antitype of the land given to obedient children by the fifth com|mandment.</P>
<P>To this land of the &s;piritual I&s;rael, it &s;eems, Rachel's children will return, tho&s;e babes of Bethlehem, who were &s;lain by the cruelty of Herod. The thirty fir&s;t chapter of Jeremiah contains a prophecy of the Millennium, or of the next di&s;pen&s;ation, as well as this; and in ver&s;e 15, 16, 17, we have the&s;e words&mdash;'A voice was heard in Rama, lamentation and bitter weeping; Rachel weeping for her children, refu&s;ed to be comforted for her children, becau&s;e they are not. Thus &s;aith the Lord, Refrain thy voice from weeping, and thine eyes from tears: for thy work &s;hall be rewarded, and they &s;hall come again from the land of the enemy, and there is hope in thine end, &s;aith the Lord, that thy children &s;hall come again to their own bor|ders.' The &s;ame pious parents in Beth|lehem, who&s;e affliction is here predicted, are here exhorted to patience and re&s;ignation, and are comforted too with the glorious prom|i&s;e that their children &s;hall return to their own borders, i. e. to the antitype of their own bor|ders. They &s;hall come again from the land

<P>The New Te&s;tament prophecy, which is the greate&s;t expo&s;itor of the Old, knows of no other land of I&s;rael below the third heaven but the new earth.

<P>ANOTHER great event which will &s;erve to con&s;titute the glory of the Millennium, is the &s;alvation of the Jews. That they will yet embrace the Chri&s;tian faith is very man|ife&s;t, not only from &s;everal pa&s;&s;ages in the
<PB N="86" REF="032007_0110_0FF09F2EA3D7C800">Old Te&s;tament, but from Rom. xi. and 2 Cor iii. 16. By an eye of faith they will fir&s;t look on him whom they have pierced and mou and then be brought into the land of I&s;rael. The prophets repre&s;ent their gracious return as the happy <HI>con&s;equence</HI> of their repentance and humiliation in their &s; tate of captivity and di&s;per&s;ion, as appears from Levit. xxvi. 40 to 45.

<P>Though infidelity and all manner of wick|edne&s;s will doubtle&s;s continue to prevail among us to the end; yet, from what has been &s;hewn, we may expect that, by remark|able revivals here and there, God will call in his elect at different times, till at length the Jews will embrace the truth as it is in Je&s;us. And when the&s;e natural branches &s;hall be graffed in again, the wild olive branches &s;hall be broken off. As the Jews in general were given over to infidelity and fal&s;e religion when we were converted; &s;o the Chri&s;tians in general will be given over to infidelity and fal&s;e religion when the Jews &s;hall be con|verted.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">And yet their conver&s;ion will be as life from the dead to the greate&s;t part of mankind: For Chri&s;tendom is but &s;mall part of the globe.</NOTE> This appears not only by Chap II.

<P>The injurious treatment which the Jews have received from the Chri&s;tians, and from that church in particular to whom this epi&s;tle was directed, plainly manife&s;ts how nece&s;&s;ary this admonition was. The Gentile Chri&s;tians in general have not continued in that good|ne&s;s of God which has &s;o wonderfully di&s;tin|gui&s;hed them from the Jews. They have been high-minded, and boa&s;ted again&s;t the natural branches. In&s;tead of pitying them, and u&s;ing the be&s;t means for removing their prejudices, we have de&s;pi&s;ed them, and in many in&s;tances not allowed them the com|mom privilege of citizens. They have been a reproach and a proverb, a taunt and a cur&s;e among us; yea, we have plundered and per|&s;ecuted them from age to age. What then are we to expect but the dreadful accompli&s;h|ment of the above &s;olemn threatening, that the greate&s;t part of the Chri&s;tian world will in that day be given over to infidelity and fal&s;e religion, to hardne&s;s of heart and blind|ne&s;s of mind?</P>
<P>Hence al&s;o we may expect, that when the Jews &s;hall become true believers, the Chri&s;tian Gentiles will become their enemies and furious per&s;ecutors; and as, when the Gen|tiles fir&s;t believed, &s;ome Jews united with them &s;o, when the Jews &s;hall believe, &s;ome

<P>Here will be the la&s;t per&s;ecution of our di&s;|pen&s;ation, Gog and Magog; the battle of the great day of God Almighty.

Chri&s;t will fir&s;t appear, then the dead &s;hall ri&s;e, and then the living &s;aints will be changed. 1 The&s;&s;. iv. 16, 17.

In this manner will the dead and living of the true I&s;rael be gathered from the four winds and be brought into their own land, that is, into the new earth, the glorious antitype of ancient Canaan. And according|ly the dead, as well as the living, have re|ceived a promi&s;e, that they &s;hall return into the land of I&s;rael. I&s;a. xxxv. 10. 'The ran&s;omed of the Lord &s;hall return and come to Zion with &s;ongs, and everla&s;ting joy &s;hail be upon their heads; they &s;hall obtain joy and gladne&s;s, and &s;orrow and &s;ighing &s;hall flee away.'

Both kinds of re&s;urrection are mentioned by our Lord in the &s;ame di&s;cour&s;e. John v. 25, 28, 29. This is univer&s;ally acknowledged; and &s;ee how he expre&s;&s;es him&s;elf in order to be under&s;tood: 'Verily, verily, I &s;ay unto you, The hour is coming and now is, when the dead &s;hall hear the voice of the Son of God, and they that hear &s;hall <HI>live.</HI>' This is the &s;piritual re&s;urrection. 'Marvel not at this; the hour is coming in the which all that are <HI>in the graves</HI> &s;hall hear his voice, and <HI>come forth;</HI> they who have done good unto the re&s;urrection of life, and they who have done evil unto the re&s;urrection of damnation.' Here Chri&s;t plainly means the corporeal re&s;|urrection, and his manner of expre&s;&s;ion is ju&s;t like that of the prophet in the pa&s;&s;age be|fore us.</P>
<P N="3">3. Though this prophecy refers to the whole &s;piritual I&s;rael, it is evident that one &s;pecial de&s;ign of it was to comfort tho&s;e pious captives, who &s;aid, Our hope is lo&s;t, we are <HI>cut off</HI> for <HI>our parts,</HI> and to convince them that <HI>their</HI> hope was <HI>not</HI> lo&s;t, and that they were <HI>not</HI> wholly cut off for <HI>their parts.</HI> But if only a &s;piritual re&s;urrection is here intend|ed, the prophecy leaves them as it finds them, without any more hope, as to <HI>their own ca&s;e,</HI> than they had before. For the prophet only
<PB N="92" REF="032007_0116_0FF09F6C81ABA490">to tell the&s;e captives that there will be a great reformation among mankind &s;ome time or other, was certainly not the mo&s;t direct meth|od to convince them that <HI>their</HI> hope was not lo&s;t and that <HI>they</HI> were not cut off <HI>for their parts.</HI> But if this prediction be literal, it &s;peaks directly to their ca&s;e, and is full of con&s;olation for tho&s;e who were to die in that grievous captivity.</P>
<P N="4">4. This chapter is evidently parallel with the xxth. of Revelation. Both chapters predict the re&s;urrection of God's people. Both have a &s;imilar de&s;ign. Both are intended to give con&s;olation to per&s;ons in a &s;imilar condition. The former to comfort tho&s;e who died in the captivity of Affyria and Babylon; the latter to comfort tho&s;e who died in my&s;tical Baby|lon. And as, in the book of Ezekiel, the prophecy of Gog and Magog is next in order to that of the re&s;urrection and David's reign over the land of I&s;rael; &s;o, in the book of Revelation, the prophecy of Gog and Magog is next in order to, that of the re&s;urrection and Chri&s;t's reign over the new earth. The&s;e con&s;iderations afford evidence that the proph|et Ezekiel here foretels the very &s;ame re&s;ur|rection as that in the xxth. of Revelation. And as the latter has already been &s;hewn to be literal in Chap. II. Sect. 4, it is certainly mo&s;t rational to under&s;tand the former in the &s;ame light.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ezekiel in the prophecy of Gog and Magog has in view the type and antitype; but John only the antitype.</NOTE></P>

The prophet in the latter part of this chap|ter &s;eems to foretel the perfect union of God's people of I&s;rael and Judah, and perhaps of Jews and Gentiles, as their antitype; repre|&s;ented by two &s;ticks, which became one in his hand, that the glorious church, thus unit|ed, &s;hall have David for their king, and the land of I&s;rael for their habitation; but here David is Chri&s;t, and con&s;equently the land of I&s;rael mu&s;t be the land of Chri&s;t, the new earth on which Chri&s;t will reign with his &s;aints a thou&s;and years,</P>
<P>Thus it appears that, not the type, but the antitype; not the old Canaan in its pre&s;ent or former &s;tate, but the New Canaan, far more excellent and glorious, is re&s;erved for the Jews, in common with other believers, when they &s;hall have embraced the true Me&s;|&s;iah.

<P>The &s;ame Old Te&s;tament prophecies which have been &s;uppo&s;ed to predict the return of the Jews to their old land do as plainly predict the return of their ancient ceremo|nial

<P N="1">1. Hence it appears probable, that the true go&s;pel church at the coming of Chri&s;t will con&s;i&s;t chiefly of Jews. Their conver|&s;ion will afford another important argument in favour of divine revelation; but the Chri&s;|tian infidels will not regard it at all. The Bible will &s;till be ridiculed, and the doctrine of Chri&s;t's coming in particular. And many of tho&s;e who &s;hall believe it, will con&s;ider it far di&s;tant, and place it beyond the Millennium. Though the knowledge of &s;cripture among the pious will be greatly increa&s;ed, as well as every other branch of knowledge in the world, &s;till 'the wicked &s;hall do wickedly, and none of them &s;hall under&s;tand; but the wi&s;e &s;hall under&s;tand.'

<P N="2">2. Hence, perhaps, we may find what is, intended by the fulne&s;s of the Jews and ful|ne&s;s of the Gentiles, Rom. xi. 12 and 25. The fulne&s;s of the Jews mu&s;t be the fulne&s;s of the elect among the Jews. This will read|ily be granted. And the fulne&s;s of the Gen|tiles mu&s;t in this ver&s;e &s;ignify the fulne&s;s of the elect among <HI>our Chri&s;tian and Mahometan Gentiles,</HI> and not among the millennial Gen|tiles, as &s;ome might imagine: For 'blindne&s;s in part,' &s;ay, Paul, 'is happened to I&s;rael, until the fulne&s;s of the Gentiles be come in.'<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"It cannot be denied but that &s;ome of Paul's expre&s;&s;ions are like unto what is in Luke's go&s;pel, and why may not this allude to that in Luke xxi. 24? 'Jeru&s;alem &s;hall be trodden down of the Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled,' i. e. un|til the times be fulfilled when the fourth monarchy &s;hall come to its ruin. See a like phra&s;e Jer. xxvii. 7. When the four mon|archies of the Gentiles are fini&s;hed, then ends the time of the Gentiles,"&mdash;<HI>Mather's Doctrine of the Jews' Conv. Chap.</HI> 2.</NOTE> But this blindne&s;s in part, it is allowed, will continue no longer than till about the time when the Millennium &s;hall commence, and con&s;equently this fulne&s;s of the Gentiles will take place about the &s;ame time; but &s;urely the fulne&s;s of all the nations on the globe will not take place till a thou&s;and years af|terwards. Our Lord predicted that Jeru&s;a|lem
<PB N="96" REF="032007_0120_0FF09F5398E71388">&s;hould be trodden down of the Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled. Luke xxi. 24. The times of the Gentiles will be fulfilled 'when time &s;hall be no long|er;' that is, when our Chri&s;tian day of grace &s;hall be fini&s;hed, and con&s;equently when the fulne&s;s of our Gentiles &s;hall come in, and not when the thou&s;and years &s;hall be fini&s;hed: For then Jeru&s;alem would be trodden down of the Gentiles through the thou&s;and years, which all deny who either maintain or oppo&s;e the millenarian doctrine.</P>
<P>Here then is another proof that the fulne&s;s of the Gentiles in the above pa&s;&s;age is the fulne&s;s of <HI>our</HI> Gentiles, who enjoy the pre&s;ent go&s;pel di&s;pen&s;ation. The elect number of the Jews and of the Chri&s;tian Gentiles will of the ungodly will be con&s;igned to ruin. And yet the fulne&s;s of the Jews will be the riches of the Gentiles and life from the dead to the Gentiles. Becau&s;e, not only will the &s;alvation of <HI>our</HI> elect Gentiles be then com|pleted, but this event will be followed by the conver&s;ion of all the Pagan Gentiles to a far more glorious go&s;pel than was ever enjoyed in any preceding age of the world.</P>
<P N="3">3. How often &s;hould the conver&s;ion of the Jews be the &s;ubject of prayer! It is our indi&s;pen&s;able duty to pray for all men now living, if peradventure God will give them repentance to the acknowledgment of the truth. Paul prayed for the Jews even after
<PB N="97" REF="032007_0121_0FF09F55A66C74D0">they were rejected: 'My heart's de&s;ire,' he &s;ays, 'and prayer to God for I&s;rael is, that they may be &s;aved.' But at the pre&s;ent time the &s;aints have peculiar encouragement to pray for their conver&s;ion. It is a glorious even &s;wiftly approaching. From what has been ob&s;erved, it mu&s;t precede the coming of Chri&s;t, and may be expected within a few years. Before Chri&s;t's coming they will &s;ay, 'Ble&s;&s;ed is he who cometh in the name of the Lord;' but they will not &s;ay this before their conver&s;ion.</P>
<P>We now &s;ee the dawn of the Millennium; a day neither clear nor dark, and delu&s;ion and wickedne&s;s will make it &s;till darker. 'But it &s;hall come to pa&s;s, that at the evening time it &s;hall be light;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There was dawn of our di&s;pen&s;ation before &s;unri&s;e; a day among the Jews neither clear nor dark, by John's mini&s;try and that of our Saviour.

Then was fulfilled that in Zech. xiv. 6, 7. The &s;ame production now begins to have a &s;econdary accompli&s;hment: the dawn of the next di&s;pen&s;ation vi&s;iting us before the &s;econd appearance of the S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n of Righteou&s;ne&s;s.</NOTE> with the Jews fir&s;t and then with the Pagans. Therefore, &s;ince mul|titudes who bear the name of Chri&s;tians, mu&s;t and will reject the power and purity of the go&s;pel, how joyfully, how thankfully &s;hould every true &s;aint embrace the encouragement in favour of the Jews which the promi&s;es af|ford, and improve it by frequent and fervent prayer for their &s;peedy reformation; that the veil may be removed from their heart, while
<PB N="98" REF="032007_0122_0FF09F40337DD6C8">Mo&s;es is read before them; that they may truly accept of the puni&s;hment of their ini|quities, which divine ju&s;tice has inflicted upon them for &s;o many ages, that &s;o the true peo|ple of God, Jews and Gentiles, may con&s;ti|tute one go&s;pel church, and dwell together in the glorious land of the &s;piritual I&s;rael.

<HEAD><HI>SECTION. IV.</HI> The Third Di&s;pen&s;ation a glorious Exhibition of Chri&s;t's Kingly Character.</HEAD>
<P>THE doctrine of Chri&s;t's per&s;onal reign with his &s;aints on the earth is the nece&s;&s;ary inference from the preceding rea&s;oning, e&s;|pecially that in Sect. 2 and 4, of Chap. II. All who maintain that Chri&s;t will appear per|&s;onally when the thou&s;and years &s;hall com|mence, and that the fir&s;t re&s;urrection will be corporeal, freely allow and believe that Chri&s;t's per&s;onal reign will be the happy con&s;equence.
<PB N="99" REF="032007_0123_0FF09F6E8E733030">It is acknowledged by all, that when Chri&s;t &s;hall come to the earth, he will continue here till the long day of judgment &s;hall be fini&s;hed; and that the &s;aints will be rai&s;ed and contin|ue here with him through all that time: And while they continue here, they will certainly reign here, as their triumphant &s;ong declares, Rev. v. 10. 'And ha&s;t made us unto our God kings and prie&s;ts, and we &s;hall reign on the earth.' Therefore the &s;ame &s;criptures which prove that their re&s;urrection &s;hall take place, and that Chri&s;t will per&s;onally appear when the Millennium &s;hall commence, do necce&s;&s;arily prove their millennial reign.</P>
<P>But, &s;ince this doctrine is con&s;idered by many as very unrea&s;onable, it is nece&s;&s;ary to take partitular notice of the arguments which are offered again&s;t it. There are &s;ev|eral in Dr. Hopkins's Treati&s;e on the Millen|nium; the con&s;ideration of which, how much &s;oever that excellent performance is to be e&s;teemed, cannot be omitted: One is taken from Col. iii. 4, 'When Chri&s;t who, is our life &s;hall appear, then &s;hall ye al&s;o appear with him in glory.' "Appearing with Chri&s;t in glory," &s;ays the Doctor, "means appearing with him in heaven, as that is the place of glory."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sy&s;tem of Divinity, Vol. II. p. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">29&mdash;231</NOTE></P>
<P>But the earth will be the place of glory, it may be an&s;wered, 'when the Son of Man &s;hall come in his glory,' and 'all the earth &s;hall be filled with his glory.' The Doc|tor him&s;elf &s;ays, that "when Chri&s;t &s;hall
<PB N="100" REF="032007_0124_0FF09F7086DF23D8">come per&s;onally, he will appear, and the &s;aints with him, &s;omewhere near the earth, and that here they may continue to judge the world many thou&s;and years." But how then is it true, that when Chri&s;t &s;hall appear, the &s;aints &s;hall appear with him in heaven?</P>
<P>To &s;how how contrary it is to all rea&s;on that Chri&s;t will come per&s;onally on the earth, the Doctor offers the following arguments:</P>
<P N="1">1. "He is in the mo&s;t convenient and agreeable &s;ituation to govern the world and take care of his church."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Treati&s;e on the Millennium, p. 46&mdash;50.</NOTE></P>
<P>And he will be in the mo&s;t convenient &s;it|uation for the&s;e purpo&s;es after his &s;econd com|ing, which &s;ituation the Doctor allows, will be &s;omewhere near the earth, and that for many thou&s;and years.</P>
<P N="2">2. "It does not appear agreeable to his &s;tation and office, as King and Head over all things, for him to de&s;cend in the human na|ture and erect a throne on earth, which, &s;o far as can be conceived, would be no advan|tage to his per&s;on, de&s;ign, and work, but very much to the contrary."</P>
<P>And yet the Doctor &s;ays, that "Chri&s;t will de&s;cend and erect a throne &s;omewhere near the earth, and may judge mankind here many thou&s;and years." And Job &s;ays, 'I know that my Redeemer liveth, and that he &s;hall &s;tand at the latter day <HI>upon</HI> the earths.' Where then is the difficulty of &s;uppo&s;ing that one of the&s;e many thou&s;and years will be im|proved for judging the living? Why is it
<PB N="101" REF="032007_0125_0FF09F60706B5AF0">"contrary to all rea&s;on," that all nations &s;hould enjoy a theocracy hereafter, any more than that one nation &s;hould have enjoyed this kind of government heretofore? And why will it be a greater di&s;advantage to Chri&s;t's per&s;on, de&s;ign or work, for him to be a glorious King on the earth for a thou&s;and years, than it was for him to have been a poor &s;ervant on the earth for thirty years. Angels and the ju&s;t made perfect, are now fully &s;atisfied. that Chri&s;t is infinitely ju&s;t and righteous; but when he &s;hall have governed a world of nations for &s;everal ages without failing of per|fect rectitude in a &s;ingle in&s;tance, how much more firmly will his character, as Judge, be e&s;tabli&s;hed in the view of all! How much more clearly and joyfully will the &s;aints at la&s;t behold his qualifications for that infinitely &s;olemn bu&s;ine&s;s which &s;hall then follow, of judging the wicked and determining the final condition of the whole human race! How will the happy myriads &s;hout with loud voices, 'Worthy is the Lamb who has reigned, to receive power and riches and wi&s;dom and &s;trength, and to reward every man according to his works:' (for in righteou&s;ne&s;s hath he ruled the world) and ju&s;tice and judgment are the habitation of his throne.</P>
<P>Hitherto God, in his manner of working, has ever proceeded from inferior to &s;uperior di&s;plays of his character. How then can it be "contrary to all rea&s;on" to imagine, that the <HI>inferior</HI> di&s;plays of his character, <HI>as Judge,</HI> will precede the employment of that mo&s;t
<PB N="102" REF="032007_0126_0FF09F6AF0E351E0">&s;olemn tribunal which can be conceived of in the aniver&s;e. When the&s;e things are con|&s;idered, how will Chri&s;t's per&s;onal reign be any di&s;advantage at all to his per&s;on, de&s;ign or work? Some have con&s;idered the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> coming of Chri&s;t as a great di&s;advantage to his per|&s;on, and of cour&s;e have denied that there was ever &s;uch an event; but the truth is, we are poorly able to determine, till Chri&s;t has told us, what is mo&s;t for the advantage of his per|&s;on, de&s;ign or work.</P>
<P N="3">3. "He is now in the be&s;t &s;ituation to be adored and wor&s;hipped by his church on earth, though they now do not &s;ee him; yet believing and loving him, they rejoice with joy un&s;peakable and full of glory. And it would not tend to increa&s;e this faith, love and joy, to have him come from heaven and live in &s;ome place on earth in his human na|ture; but the contrary: For but few, com|pared with the whole inhabitants of the world, could have acce&s;s to him or &s;ee him more than they now do. And when the human nature is in heaven, all may equally have <HI>ac|ce&s;s</HI> to him;" that is, <HI>&s;piritual</HI> acce&s;s, and &s;uch acce&s;s all may equally have too when the human nature is upon earth. Chri&s;t's human nature has been once on the earth al|ready. And <HI>then</HI> all had equal acce&s;s to his &s;piritual pre&s;ence, and &s;ome had peculiar ac|ce&s;s to his bodily pre&s;ence, and &s;uch the ca&s;e may be hereafter. And though Chri&s;t is now, and always will be, "in the be&s;t &s;itua|tion to be adored;" yet this be&s;t &s;ituation,
<PB N="103" REF="032007_0127_0FF09F5A08452C18">the Doctor allows, will not always be in heaven; but will yet be, for a long time, &s;omewhere near the earth. And though ma|ny &s;aints, in that day, &s;hould not &s;ee him with bodily eyes, it does not follow that they would enjoy a le&s;s degree of faith, love and joy, than if he were to continue in heaven without their &s;eeing him. His bodily ab&s;ence from their &s;ight will not hinder their being far more happy under his glorious government than they could be in this world without it.</P>
<P>If the tendency of Chri&s;t's per&s;onal pre&s;|ence is to render the &s;aints on earth lets holy and happy, certainly the apo&s;tles had rea&s;on to mourn, while the bridegroom was with them. Strange, that the be&s;t &s;ociety near, the be&s;t in&s;truction and the be&s;t government, &s;hould tend to make the &s;aints le&s;s holy and happy than if they were without them!</P>
<P N="4">4. "It does not appear to be any advan|tage to the departed &s;aints to come to live a thou&s;and years in this world before the gen|eral re&s;urrection. So far as can be conceiv|ed, it would be no addition, but a diminution to their happine&s;s; a degradation, which on no account can be de&s;irable to the &s;pirits of the ju&s;t now made perfect in heaven: they could not know or enjoy &s;o much of the pro&s;|perity and happine&s;s of the church in the &s;al|vation of men, were they to live in bodies on earth in that time. Such a change of place could be no privilege or reward; but rather a calamity."</P>
<P><PB N="104" REF="032007_0128_0FF09F342C1746F8">
But why will &s;uch a change from heaven to <HI>the new earth</HI> be a greater calamity at the commencement of the Millennium than it would be at the end of it, when, according to the Doctor's opinion, the &s;aints will begin to live &s;omewhere near the earth many thou|&s;and years? And how does it appear that they could not know or enjoy &s;o much of the pro&s;perity of the church militant, were they to live in bodies at that time?

<P>The long ce&s;&s;ation of miracles among the Jews before the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> coming of Chri&s;t, was no proof that no more would ever be &s;een.

<P>Therefore, for any thing which yet appears to the contrary, it is agreeable to rea&s;on that Chri&s;t &s;hould quickly and per&s;onally appear and reign with the faints on the earth.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Doctor &s;ays, that "this phra&s;e, 'Ble&s;&s;ed and holy is he that hath part in the fir&s;t re&s;urrection,' implies that he <HI>only</HI> is ble&s;&s;ed who hath part in the fir&s;t re&s;urrection."

<P>The happy New Jeru&s;alem, it is rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e, will be a &s;ociety entirely di&s;tinct fom the church militant, or 'the nations of them who are &s;aved,' who will not then walk in New Jeru&s;alem, but only 'in the light of it.'<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The citizens of New Jeru&s;alem or church triumphant in that time may be capable of appearing to the church militant or di&s;|appearing at plea&s;ure, as Chri&s;t was after his re&s;urrection, and may he again after his &s;econd coming.

<P><PB N="108" REF="032007_0132_0FF09F520E908FB8">
But New Jeru&s;alem, it may be an&s;wered, is now in exi&s;tence, and dogs, and &s;orcerers, are without it now, as much as they will be in that future time; yet the church militant are now without it too: And &s;uch will be their ca&s;e in that day. This pa&s;&s;age declares not that <HI>only</HI> the wicked are without that city; but the plain meaning of it is, that no finally impenitent &s;inner &s;hall have a part in the ble&s;&s;edne&s;s of that city, as no &s;uch one now &s;hall ever go to heaven.</P>
<P>In oppo&s;ing the doctrine of Chri&s;t's per|&s;onal reign, Mr. Poole's continuators have an objection like this: 'If Chri&s;t &s;hould live on earth through the Millennium, the &s;aints who &s;hall die in that time will not go to Chri&s;t.' But is not this a great mi&s;take? They certainly will go to Chri&s;t when they die; even if he &s;hould reign on the earth. Already Chri&s;t has lived upon earth more than thirty years. And in that time the &s;aints who died went to Chri&s;t: for the Son of Man was then in heaven; and there too he will be through the thou&s;and years. 'This day &s;halt thou be with me in paradi&s;e:' Glo|rious promi&s;e! But Chri&s;t's bodily pre&s;ence was not in paradi&s;e that day. And we have not the lea&s;t evidence that departed &s;aints now enjoy Chri&s;t's bodily pre&s;ence any more than if this bodily pre&s;ence was now on the earth: That &s;ublime felicity is doubtle&s;s re|&s;erved for the re&s;urrection.</P>
<P>But it may be a&s;ked, How will the doctrine of Chri&s;t's per&s;onal reign agree with his &s;itting
<PB N="109" REF="032007_0133_0FF09F4223179CB0">on the right hand of God, and interceding for his people till his enemies be made his foot|&s;tool? But the an&s;wer is, When Chri&s;t &s;hall appear the &s;econd time, he will de&s;troy Gog and Magog, as already has been &s;hewn. He will de&s;troy them, who de&s;troy the earth. And the &s;pared nations will cheerfully &s;ub|mit unto him. In &s;ome part of that day, it &s;eems, all will be &s;aints, perfect or imperfect. Then 'to the name of Je&s;us every knee &s;hall bow, and every tongue &s;hall &s;wear, of things in heaven and things in earth and things <HI>un|der the earth;</HI>' that is, there will be cordial and univer&s;al &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to Chri&s;t <HI>all round the globe.</HI> Then doubtle&s;s, yea and before, his enemies will be made his foot&s;tool.</P>
<P>But if '&s;itting on the right hand of God' means the &s;ame as '&s;itting on the right hand of power,' which probably no one will deny, then he will &s;till &s;it on the right hand of God when he &s;hall appear in this world: For he tells the Jews expre&s;sly, Matt. xxvi. 64, 'Hereafter ye &s;hall &s;ee the Son of Man &s;it|ting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.' And if he can ap|pear at God's right hand one hour in this world, then doubtle&s;s he can appear in this exalted &s;tation a thou&s;and years in the &s;ame world.</P>
<P>And as to his interce&s;&s;ion, will not that work be fini&s;hed at his &s;econd coming, even if another di&s;pen&s;ation &s;hould follow? Did Chri&s;t carry on the work of interce&s;&s;ion in
<PB N="110" REF="032007_0134_0FF09F4D44739278">the time of the prophetical di&s;pen&s;ation? No. Is not our di&s;pen&s;ation peculiar for the exhi|bition of Chri&s;t's prie&s;tly character? Be &s;ure it is: 'The way into the holie&s;t of all' is now made manife&s;t, and Chri&s;t now intercedes for his elect, and why not for all his elect of each di&s;pen&s;ation, of the future as well as the pa&s;t? But &s;uppo&s;e this work of interce&s;&s;ion &s;hould continue through the Millennium, why may it not continue upon earth? Chri&s;t has once interceded for his people already on the earth. John xvii. Why then may he not in|tercede for them on earth hereafter?</P>
<P>But on the whole, the greate&s;t of all ob|jections to this doctrine among the faints &s;eems to be that of the heart. The &s;aints, in the exerci&s;e of grace, do not love to live in this world again. They had rather be in heaven; and no wonder; earth is a tire&s;ome place, full of &s;in and &s;orrow. But a new earth with Chri&s;t, and a heaven upon it, will not be tire&s;ome, but ineffably delightful. Heaven is not con&s;tituted by locality, but by perfect holine&s;s and happine&s;s.</P>
<P>There objections now con&s;idered, a few ar|guments directly proving this doctrine &s;hall clo&s;e this part of the Section.</P>
<P>The prophet Zechariah declares, (chap. xiv. 5, 9) that, 'when the Lord his God &s;hall come with all the &s;aints, the Lord &s;hall be King over all the earth: In that day there &s;hall be one Lord and his name one.' Hitherto this world has had many &s;upreme
<PB N="111" REF="032007_0135_0FF09F5814DCBA90">rulers or lords; but in that day there &s;hall be only one &s;upreme ruler: Abraham's &s;eed &s;hall po&s;&s;e&s;s the whole. 'There &s;hall be one Lord and his name one.' Then will be ful|filled that of the prophet I&s;aiah; 'He &s;hall judge among the nations and rebuke many people.' The terms <HI>judge</HI> and <HI>rebuke</HI> mean &s;omething more than merely the effu&s;ions of the Spirit on mankind, and &s;omething too be|&s;ides eccle&s;ia&s;tical government, as appears from what follows: 'They &s;hall beat their &s;words into plough&s;hares and their &s;pears in|to pruning-hooks; nation &s;hall not lift up &s;word again&s;t nation, neither &s;hall they learn war any more.' The de&s;ign of eccle&s;ia&s;tical government is the &s;upport of the Chri&s;tian character: The de&s;ign of civil government is the pre&s;ervation of life, peace and proper|ty. It is the latter which is here mentioned as the happy effect of Chri&s;t's judging among the nations and rebuking many people. And, as if it was a thing difficult for men to be|lieve, we have the &s;ame almo&s;t verbatim, in Mic. iv. 3, 4.</P>
<P>Chri&s;t judging 'the living and the dead at his appearing and <HI>kingdom,</HI>' (2 Tim. iv. 1) implies that he will erect a kingdom on earth when he &s;hall appear.

<P>The time when the kingdoms of this world &s;hall become the kingdoms of our Lord, is expre&s;sly declared to be the time of the dead, that they &s;hould be judged, and that God &s;hould give reward unto his &s;ervants, the prophets. And it has been &s;hewn how we are to under&s;tand that in I&s;a. xxxv. 10, Dan. chap. vii. and Rev. xx. which &s;o plainly &s;peak of the &s;aints reviving and appearing with the clouds, their reigning and Chri&s;t's reigning before them a thou&s;and years, in which 'the kingdom and dominion and greatne&s;s of the kingdom (not above, not in the third heaven, but) <HI>under</HI> the whole heav|en, &s;hall be given to the people of the &s;aints of the Mo&s;t High.'</P>

Another argument is the third petition of the Lord's prayer; 'Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.'

<P>Thus it appears, that the crown of Chri&s;t will be as con&s;picuous in this world as the cro&s;s once was, will put down all rule and all authority and power: And then will be manife&s;t, as never before, this glorious truth, 'The earth is the Lord's and the fulne&s;s thereof, the world, and they who dwell therein.'</P>
<P>INFERENCES.</P>
<P N="1">1. Hence we may expect that the church militant in the Millennium will have much more knowledge of he heavenly life than the pre&s;ent di&s;pen&s;ation affords. We are now po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of much more light re&s;pecting our future &s;tate than was ever enjoyed under the fir&s;t di&s;pen&s;ation. Many prophets and wi&s;e men de&s;ired to &s;ee the things which we &s;ee, but could not &s;ee them. They enjoyed &s;ome degree of light re&s;pecting the future life of man, yet it was a light &s;hining in a dark place!

They will be as God, perfectly holy as God is, and free from error: and before the feeble church militant they &s;hall be as the angel of the Lord to in&s;truct and govern them, as already has been ob&s;erved.

<P N="2">2. Ob&s;erve the glorious contra&s;t between the be&s;t government contrived by human wi&s;dom, and that which King Je&s;us &s;hall con|trive by his infinite wi&s;dom.

<HEAD>MISCELLANEOUS CONCLUSION.</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;ubject of this Differtation, in what light &s;oever the reader may view it, is unde|niably of great importance. The time here treated of is at hand; and the pre&s;ent revo|lutions and concu&s;&s;ion of nations loudly &s;o|licit our attention thereto. The man of &s;in has become old; grey hairs are here and there upon him. He cannot live long, and therefore it cannot be matter of indifference how we are to under&s;tand tho&s;e prophecies which predict the manner and circum&s;tances of his death. It cannot be matter of indiffer|ence or mere &s;peculation whether the Judge &s;tands far off or before the door.</P>
<P>But important as the &s;cheme is, if true, it mu&s;t not be generally received in the&s;e la&s;t days: For if &s;uch a belief &s;hould become general, there would be a general expecta|tion of Chri&s;t's coming. But it has been &s;hewn, that Chri&s;t will come in a day when men in general look not for him, and in an hour that they are not aware of. The opin|ion which has been &s;o common ever &s;ince the fourth century (an age remarkable for the prevalence of error) will doubtle&s;s con|tinue &s;o to the end, that the &s;cripture may be fulfilled.</P>
<P>If &s;ome things now advanced be true, a time of trouble for the church is ha&s;tening;
<PB N="117" REF="032007_0141_0FF09F43ADC20CE0">a bitter cup which &s;he mu&s;t drink at the hand of illuminated &s;inners. The liberality of &s;entiment every where prevailing at this day, is no evidence of the contrary at all. Tran|&s;itions from one extreme to another among mankind, are no &s;trange events.</P>
<P>The next generation, it is highly probable, will be more corrupt than this, both in prin|ciple and practice. And the hearts of all mu&s;t be revealed &s;ooner or later; every &s;ort of men mu&s;t be known. We know what method was taken to manife&s;t the hearts of the liberal Jews; and Divine Wi&s;dom will certainly find &s;ome method hereafter, clearly to manife&s;t that the <HI>greate&s;t</HI> catholici&s;m of an unregenerate man, is entirely con&s;i&s;tent with inveterate enmity again&s;t the true religion. But in all this futur e trouble, the church will be &s;upported and comforted. They who know their God will be &s;trong, and do ex|ploits, and the gates of hell &s;hall not prevail again&s;t them. The conver&s;ion of the Jews will afford matter of abundant joy to the precious, believing remnant of the Gentiles. It will &s;erve to &s;trengthen their faith, and pre|&s;ent to their view a &s;weet pro&s;pect of their &s;peedy and perfect deliverance from all the oppo&s;ition of earth and hell.
