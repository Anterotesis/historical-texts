<HEAD>THE CASE OF THE GEORGIA SALES ON THE MISSISSIPPI CONSIDERED &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THE Opinion of coun&s;el is required on the following points.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. Whether any claims of the United States can affect the purcha&s;es of land made from the &s;tate of Georgia in 1795, by the Upper Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi and Georgia Companies or either of them?</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. Whether tho&s;e purcha&s;es can be affected by the Act of the Georgia legi&s;lature pa&s;&s;ed Febru|ary 3, 1796, and commonly called the Repeal|ing Act?</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>In an&s;wering the fir&s;t of the&s;e que&s;tions it will be proper to con&s;ider the claims of the United States under two points of view; fir&s;t as they re|&s;pect the &s;tate of Georgia it&s;elf; and &s;econdly, as they re&s;pect the purcha&s;ers under the &s;tate. For, though in general, purcha&s;ers &s;tand, as to all legal intents, in the &s;ame &s;ituation with the &s;eller, there may be particular circum&s;tances which will create a wide difference between them. It will be proper to enquire whether the&s;e lands or any part of them belonged to the United States at the time of the
<PB N="2" REF="035588_0004_1005F742584C2760">&s;ale? and, in that ca&s;e, whether it was attended or preceded by any conduct on their part, which will render it valid again&s;t them in the eye of the law?</P>
<P>In di&s;cu&s;&s;ing the que&s;tion "Whether any part of the&s;e lands belonged to the United States at the time of the &s;ale" we mu&s;t carry back our at|tention to the fir&s;t di&s;covery of North-America, and take a review of the various public acts by which the rights of &s;oil and jurisdiction, to that part of it where the lands in que&s;tion lie, have been affected from that period to the pre&s;ent time. Such other tran&s;actions as it may be nece&s;&s;ary to recur to in other parts of the inve&s;tigation, though they have no immediate relation to this point, will, for the &s;ake of per&s;picuity, be noticed in the order in which they occurred.</P>
<P>It was a principle admitted by all the European nations in the e&s;tabli&s;hment and regulation of their American colonies, that prior di&s;covery, accom|panied by actual occupation, and, in &s;ome ca&s;es, without it, ve&s;ted the right of &s;oil and juri&s;diction. Spain thus acquired her exten&s;ive dominions in South-America; and by the &s;ame &s;ide &s;he laid claim to Florida in the &s;outhern parts of the North-American continent. England, al&s;o, by virtue of di&s;coveries made under her flag in the reign of Henry VII. claimed the whole extent of North-America from Florida to Hud&s;on's bay. The boundary between her di&s;coveries and Florida re|mained for a long time uncertain, and was fre|quently the &s;ubject of di&s;pute between the two crowns. She claimed, however, as far &s;outh as the latitude twenty-nine; and Spain at length ce|ded Florida to her, which put an end to the con|tention.</P>
<P>England made &s;ettlements, at a very early pe|riod, in the northern and middle parts of this ex|ten&s;ive
<PB N="3" REF="035588_0005_1005F744F3A75F98">region, and erected governments which now compo&s;e the &s;tates from Virginia to New-Hamp&s;hire, inclu&s;ive. The&s;e governments were of two kinds, royal and proprietary. In the former the right of &s;oil and juri&s;diction remained in the crown; and their boundaries, though de&s;cribed by its letters patent, were &s;ubject to alteration at its plea&s;ure: for, as it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the rights of &s;oil and government, and delegated them to its gover|nors, during plea&s;ure, it might di&s;po&s;e of them in what manner and to whom it thought fit, might al|ter, extend, or abridge the delegation as its incli|nation or policy might dictate. In the latter, the proprietary governments, the right of &s;oil as well juri&s;diction was ve&s;ted in the proprietors. Their charters were in the nature of grants, and their li|mits being fixed by the&s;e charters could not be al|tered but by their own con&s;ent. This di&s;tinction is particularly noticed here, becau&s;e in the pro|gre&s;s of the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion it will appear to be of very great importance.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t of the governments were at fir&s;t proprie|tary; but, in progre&s;s of time, the greater part of them, either by the forfeiture or &s;urrender of the charters, became royal.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t of the&s;e charters, under which any &s;et|tlement took place, was given by Queen Elizabeth to Sir Walter Raleigh in the year 1584<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hazard's collection, 33.</NOTE>. Like the previous charters from her and Henry VII. to Cabot, Sir Humphrey Gilbert and others<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. 9, 11, 24.</NOTE>, it was merely a commi&s;&s;ion to di&s;cover any countries not occupied by Chri&s;tian people, to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of them, and form &s;ettlements under the allegiance of the crown of England. It al&s;o prohibited any other per&s;ons from &s;ettling within two hundred
<PB N="4" REF="035588_0006_1005F7468572E9A8">miles of any place where he &s;hould <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span">, "within &s;ix years." Under this charter he made two &s;ettlements: one &s;outh of the Che&s;a|peake, compo&s;ed of about one hundred per&s;ons, who arrived in June 1585, and returned to Eng|land in the June following: the other near the mouth of James' river, and con&s;i&s;ting of about the &s;ame number of &s;ettlers, who arrived in the year 1587, and continued there. In the title of the charter it is &s;aid that it &s;hall continue in force for &s;ix years, and no more; but in the body of it there is no limitation. In the year 1603<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">State trials, vol. i. p. 186.</NOTE>, how|ever, it was forfeited by the attainder of &s;ir Wal|ter Raleigh, for trea&s;on, and the right re-ve&s;ted in the crown.</P>
<P>In the year 1606, James I. by his letters pa|tent dated April 10<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Hazards col. 50.</NOTE>, gave permi&s;&s;ion to two com|panies to form &s;ettlements on any part of the coa&s;t of North-America, between latitudes 34 and 45. The&s;e companies were denominated the fir&s;t and &s;econd colonies of Virginia: The fir&s;t was to make its &s;ettlements between 34 and 41 degrees of lati|tude, the &s;econd between 38 and 45. Neither was to &s;ettle within two hundred miles of any place previou&s;ly &s;ettled by the other. Each was to po&s;&s;e&s;s all the lands along the coa&s;t fifty miles in both directions from the place of its fir&s;t &s;ettle|ment, one hundred miles back into the country, and all the i&s;lands within one hundred miles of the coa&s;t. A council was appointed for the go|vernment of each colony, and it was provided that all the lands contained within the above mention|ed limits &s;hould, on petition to the crown, be grant|ed to &s;uch per&s;ons as the re&s;pective councils &s;hould recommend.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="035588_0007_1005F748ED9B6E28">
It does not appear that any &s;uch grants were ever made; but James I. by letters patent, dated May 23, 1609<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hazardss col. 58.</NOTE>, &s;eparated the fir&s;t colony from the &s;econd, and, on the petition of the per&s;ons compo&s;ing it, erected them and a number of o|thers into a corporation under the name of "The trea&s;urer and a company of adventurers and plan|ters of the city of London, for the fir&s;t colony of Virginia." All the lands along the coa&s;t, two hundred miles &s;outh, and an equal di&s;tance north, of point Comfort, and extending we&s;t to the South-Sea, with the i&s;lands within one Hundred miles of the coa&s;t, were granted to this company, commonly called the London company, and their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, in fee &s;imple; in tru&s;t however, to be di&s;tributed among &s;ettlers: and the powers of go|vernment were ve&s;ted in two councils, one in Eng|land, and one in America.</P>
<P>Point Comfort being about latitude 36, 30, the limits of this charter mu&s;t have extended &s;outh to about latitude 33. It is not ea&s;y to determine whether the government erected by it ought to be con&s;idered as royal or proprietary; but it has more the appearance of the former.</P>
<P>On the 12, of March 1612<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. 72.</NOTE>, James I. granted another charter to the London company, which confirms the former, and adds to their territories all the i&s;lands within 300 leagues of the lands for|merly granted to them, and between the 30, and 41, degrees of latitude.</P>
<P>The company continued to exerci&s;e the powers of government, and di&s;po&s;e of the rights of &s;oil, within the limits allotted to them, till about the year 1624, when the affairs of the colony appear|ing to be badly conducted, their charters were
<PB N="6" REF="035588_0008_1005F74B7A0973D0">forfeited by quo warranto<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hazard's col. 83.89.</NOTE>, and the government with all the rights of &s;oil and juri&s;diction taken into the hands of the crown. By this re&s;umption Virginia became, if it were not &s;o before, a royal government; and its boundaries became liable to abridgment or alteration of the plea&s;ure of the monarch.</P>
<P>The rights of &s;oil and juri&s;diction in all the lands &s;outh of the Che&s;apeake, not actually appropri|ated being thus re-ve&s;ted in the crown, king Charles I. made a grant to &s;ir Robert Heath, his attorney general, extending from the 30, to the 36, degree of latitude north<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Att. gen. report, 28.</NOTE>. This grant was ever afterwards con&s;idered as void, but whether by &s;urrender, nor u&s;er, or in what other manner, does not appear.</P>
<P>The next grant of this country was by Charles II. to lord Clarendon and others bearing date March 24, 1662. It included "all that territo|ry or tract of ground &s;ituate, lying and being, within his &s;aid maje&s;ty's dominions in America, extending from the north end of the i&s;land called Lucker i&s;land, which lyeth in the northern Vir|ginia &s;eas, and within &s;ix and thirty degrees of the northern latitude, and to the we&s;t as far as the South-Seas, and &s;o &s;outherly as far as the river St. Matthias which bordereth upon the coa&s;t of Flo|rida, and within one-and-thirty degrees of nor|thern latitude, and &s;o within a direct line as far as the South-Seas afore&s;aid." The&s;e grantees were afterwards called "Lords Proprietors," and the country contained within their boundaries was erected by the charter into a province, under the name of "Carolina." Exten&s;ive immunities were conferred on &s;ettlers, and the rights of &s;oil and
<PB N="7" REF="035588_0009_1005F74EF152F400">government, were ve&s;ted in the proprietors in fee &s;imple.</P>
<P>By another charter from Charles II. bearing date June 30, 1664, the former was confirmed, and its limits extended from latitude 36, 30 to latitude 29 inclu&s;ive, and from tho&s;e points due we&s;t to the South-Sea.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Att. gen. report, 47.</NOTE></P>
<P>On the 25, of July 1726, the lords proprietors by deed duly executed, &s;urrendered to the crown all their rights under the&s;e charters<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. 44.72.</NOTE>, lord Carteret alone one of the number, retained his &s;hare, and it was afterwards &s;eparately alloted to him in the northern parts of the province. The &s;urrender was accepted and confirmed by act of parliament, and by virtue of it Carolina became a royal go|vernment. It was afterwards divided into two provinces, called North and South-Carolina, by a line beginning at the north end of long Bay, and running thence north-we&s;t to the latitude 35, and thence due we&s;t to the South-Sea; lord Carteret, better known by the name of lord Granville, had his part laid off in North-Carolina</P>
<P>George II. by letters patent bearing date on the 9, of June 1732<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. 91.97.</NOTE>, erected lord Dereival James Og|lethorpe and others, into a corporation under the title of the <Q>Tru&s;tees for e&s;tabli&s;hing the colony of Georgia in America,</Q> and granted to them and their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, in tru&s;t for future &s;ettlers, all tho&s;e lands countries and territories, &s;ituate, lying and being, in that part of South-Carolina in Ame|rica, which lies from the northern &s;tream of a ri|ver, there commonly called the Savannah, all along the &s;ea coa&s;t to the &s;outhward unto the mo&s;t &s;outhern &s;tream of a certain other great water or river called the Alatamaha, and we&s;tward from
<PB N="8" REF="035588_0010_1005F75173AE5CA8">the heads of the &s;aid river, re&s;pecttively, in direct lines to the South Seas. This country was erect|ed into a province called "Georgia," and power was given to the tru&s;tees for twenty-one years to frame laws and regulations for its government; after which all the rights of &s;oil and juri&s;diction were to ve&s;t in the crown.</P>
<P>Under this charter Oglethorpe took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the country for the tru&s;tees and made &s;everal &s;ettlements: and in the year 1752, the tru&s;tees by deed duly executed, &s;urrendered their charter to the crown<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Att gen. report, 97.</NOTE>, Georgia therefrom bcame a royal government.</P>
<P>By the treaty of Paris in 1763, Spain ceded to Great-Britain, Florida, Pen&s;acola, and, in general, all that &s;he held in North-America ea&s;t and &s;outh|ea&s;t of the river Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi: and a line drawn down that river from its &s;ource to the &s;&eacute;a, was e&s;tabli&s;h|ed as the we&s;tern boundary of the Briti&s;h domi|nions<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See an extract from the treaty, appendix, No. 1</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Soon after this ce&s;&s;ion the Briti&s;h government, by a proclamation for the regulation of its colo|nies being dated October 7, 1763, errcted Florida into two governments called Ea&s;t and We&s;t Florida. They were divided from each other by the Ape|latchicola river; and the latter was bounded by the gulph of Mexico on the &s;outh, on the we&s;t by lakes Pontchartrain and Maurepas, and the river Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi, and on the north by a line drawn from that part of the river Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi which is inter&s;ect|ed by latitude 31, due ea&s;t to the Apilachicola. The northern boundary of Ea&s;t Florida was a line drawn from the confluence of the Chatahocchee and Flint rivers, where they form the Apilachi|cola,
<PB N="9" REF="035588_0011_1005F753064F5370">to the head of the St. Mary's, and down it to the &s;ea.</P>
<P>Di&s;putes in the mean time having ari&s;en be|tween the governments of South-Carolina and Georgia, about the lands, lying between the Ala|tamoha and St. Mary's, they were, by this pro|clamation, annexed to Georgia<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the proclamation, Appendix, No. 2.</NOTE>, who&s;e &s;outhern boundary, &s;tretching only to the Alatamoha by its original charter, was thus extended to the ri|ver St. Mary's.</P>
<P>The proclamation al&s;o contains a clau&s;e, "Re|&s;erving under the &s;overeignty, protection and domi|nion of the crown, for the u&s;e of the Indians, all the land and territories not included within the li|mits of the governments thereby erected, or with|in the limits of the territory granted to the Hud|&s;ons Bay company; <HI>as al&s;o all the lands and territo|ries lying to the we&s;tward of the &s;ources of the rivers which fall into the &s;ea from the we&s;t and north-we&s;t,"</HI> and it forbids "the governors of all the colonies to grant warrants of &s;urvey, or pa&s;s patents, for any lands beyond the heads of the&s;e rivers, till the further plea&s;ure of the crown &s;hould be known."</P>
<P>When the fir&s;t Briti&s;h governor took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of We&s;t Florida he found its limits to the north &s;o contracted as to cut him off from the mo&s;t fertile and healthy lands, and even to exclude from his province &s;ome very con&s;iderable &s;ettlements, which had been formed under it, and made part of it, while &s;ubject to Spani&s;h government. He made a repre&s;entation of the&s;e circum&s;tances to the crown<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. No. 3.</NOTE>. It was referred to the board of trade and plantations; and by their advice the province was extended to the north, "By a line drawn from the north of the Yazoo river where it unites
<PB N="10" REF="035588_0012_1005F75678CDCF20">with the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi, due ea&s;t to the Apilachicola." This exten&s;ion, which took place before the year 1770, was not made by proclamation, but by in|&s;tructions to the governors of that province, and their commi&s;&s;ions<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See appendix No. 4. An extract from the in&s;tructions to governor Che&s;|ter. It is not known that any copy of any other of the&s;e in&s;tructions or com|mi&s;&s;ions exi&s;t in America. See al&s;o Att. gen. report, 21.</NOTE>. They went on to exerci&s;e ju|ri&s;diction and grant lands in the country thus an|next to their government, till it was ceded to the United States by Great-Britain, at the peace of 1783.</P>
<P>When the Briti&s;h colonies, including South-Carolina and Georgia, di&s;&s;olved their connection with the mother country in the year 1776, and erected them&s;elves into independent &s;tates, they agreed that each &s;hould hold by its former limits; that each &s;tate &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s the &s;ame extent of territory that had belonged to it while a colony. This indeed was not readily contented to: for as the limits of &s;everal colonies, as Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, Connecticut, New-York, Penn&s;ylvania, Virginia, North-Carolina, South-Carolina and Georgia, in|cluded a great extent of un&s;ettled country, while others, as New-Hamp&s;hire, Rhode-I&s;land, Jer&s;ey, Delaware, and Maryland, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed little or none, the latter contended that the&s;e un&s;ettled lands &s;hould be con&s;idered as a common property among all the &s;tates, and appropriated for their mutual benefit; and &s;ome of them, particularly Mary|land, refu&s;ed to accede to the union, until &s;ome of tho&s;e &s;tates which po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the mo&s;t exten&s;ive limits, &s;hould relinqui&s;h a part of their claims for this purpo&s;e. This was at length done; Ma&s;&s;a|chu&s;etts, Connecticut, New-York, and Virginia, made relinqui&s;hments, retaining however very con&s;iderable portions of the land in que&s;tion. The
<PB N="11" REF="035588_0013_1005F758D59A0398">articles of confederation were then ratified, leaving all tho&s;e &s;tates which had made no relinqui&s;hment in the quiet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the whole territory com|prized within their ancient limits. Of this number was Georgia; which was &s;o far from relinqui&s;hing, that on February 7, 1783 &s;he pa&s;&s;ed an act a&s;&s;erting that her juri&s;diction and right of &s;oil extended "over all the country between the Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi, the Atlantic, the &s;outhern boundary of the United States as e&s;tabli&s;hed by the treaty of peace, and the Southern boundary of North-Carolina.</P>
<P>By another act pa&s;&s;ed February 7, 1785 &s;he pro|ceeded to exerci&s;e the rights which &s;he had thus a&s;&s;erted. It was thereby enacted "That all the country contained within a line to be drawn down the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi from where it receives the Yazoo, till it inter&s;ects the 31&s;t degree of North latitude, then due ea&s;t as far as the lands might be found to reach which had at any time been relinqui&s;hed by the In|dians, then along the line of relinqui&s;hment to the river Yazoo, and down it to its mouth, &s;hould be erected into a county called Bourbon, and that when the land-office &s;hould be opened, all per&s;ons previou&s;ly &s;ettled there &s;hould have the right of pre|emption at one fourth of a dollar per acre."</P>
<P>Under this act, commonly called the Bourbon county act, no &s;ettlements were ever made. The relinqui&s;hment of land which is &s;poken of in it took place at Mobile in May 1777, by virtue of a treaty between the Choctaw nation, to whom that country then belonged, and the Briti&s;h &s;uperinten|dant of Indian affairs, and was confirmed by the treaty between tho&s;e Indians and the United States held at Hopewell on the 3d of January 1786. It extended from the mouth of the Yazoo 110 miles
<PB N="12" REF="035588_0014_1005F75A637D7AD0">down the Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi; at the upper end it was 15, at the lower 60 miles broad.</P>
<P>About the &s;ame time a di&s;pute aro&s;e between the &s;tates of South-Carolina and Georgia re&s;pecting their boundaries. South-Carolina contended that as the original boundaries of Georgia were the ri|vers Savannah and Alatahama, and lines drawn due we&s;t from their &s;ources to the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi, all the land lying &s;outh of the Alatamaha and of a line drawn due we&s;t from its &s;ource to the Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi, as far as to the northern boundary of the Floridas, con|tinued to be a part of the province of South Caro|lina, out of which Georgia was taken: and that when the Briti&s;h crown, by its proclamation of Oc|tober 7, 1763, annexed to Georgia, "all the lands lying between the rivers Alatemaha and St. Ma|ry's" it meant only the lands actually between tho&s;e rivers below their &s;ources, and not &s;uch as lay above tho&s;e &s;ources, and between lines drawn from them re&s;pectively we&s;t to the Mi&s;&s;i&s;ippi; which tracts of country, of cour&s;e, even after the pro|clamation, &s;till continued a part of South Carolina. Georgia, on the contrary, maintained that when the proclamation annexed to its governmeet "all the lands lying between the rivers Alatamaha and St. Mary's it meant to include not merely the tract of country which lay between tho&s;e rivers, below their &s;ources, but al&s;o the whole territory held by the Briti&s;h crown between the north|ern boundaries of the Floridas, as e&s;tabli&s;hed by the &s;ame proclamation, and the ancient &s;outh|ern line of Georgia. This di&s;pute was referred to congre&s;s under the articles of confederation by a petition from South-Carolina<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Journals of Con. vol. x. p. 190.</NOTE>. A court was ap|pointed, and a day fixed for a hearing between the two &s;tates. But they afterwards agreed to with|draw

<P>On the 21&s;t of December 1789, the legi&s;lature of Georgia pa&s;&s;ed an act for &s;elling all this country from the mouth of Coles creek, which is a little a|bove the Natches, to latitude 35, and from the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi to the Donbigby. Two companies were to be the purcha&s;ers, one called the South-Caroli|na, the other the Virginia Yazoo company; and they were allowed a pre-emption of two years, on their making the &s;tipulated payments, within which periods they were to receive grants.

<P>On the &s;eventh of January 1795, the legi&s;lature of Georgia pa&s;&s;ed an act for &s;elling parts of the territory on the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi, above latitude 31, to &s;e|veral companies, one of which was called the Up|per Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi, and another the Georgia company. The&s;e are the companies who&s;e rights are the &s;ub|ject of the pre&s;ent inve&s;tigation. The land allotted to the fir&s;t was directed to be bounded by a line "Beginning at the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi river where the northern boundary line of this &s;tate (Georgia) &s;trikes the &s;ame: thence along the &s;aid boundary line due ea&s;t to the Tene&s;&s;ee river; thence along the &s;aid Tene&s;&s;ee river to the mouth of Bear Creek'; thence up Bear Creek, to where the parrallel of latitude twenty-five Briti&s;h &s;tatute miles &s;outh of the northern boundary afore&s;aid &s;trikes the &s;ame; thence along the &s;aid la&s;t mentioned parrallel of latitude, acro&s;s Tombigby or twenty mile creek, due we&s;t to the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi river; thence up the middle of the &s;aid river to the beginning." The boundaries of the Georgia company were a line, "beginning on the Mobile Bay, where the latitude 31, degrees north of the equator inter&s;ects the &s;ame, and running up the &s;aid Bay to the mouth of the lake Ten&s;aw; thence up the &s;aid lake Ten|&s;aw to the. Alabama river, including currys and all other i&s;lands therein; thence up the Alabama to the junction of the Coo&s;a and Danfu&s;kee rivers;

<P>It was provided that the companies &s;hould each make a certain depo&s;it of money, on account of the purcha&s;e money of the lands, in the trea&s;ury of the &s;tate; and that on their producing receipts from the trea&s;urer for the&s;e depo&s;its, the govern|or &s;hould give them grants, taking at the &s;ame time mortgages of the lands to &s;ecure the re|maining payments, which were to be made on or before the fir&s;t of November following. In ca&s;e of failure in the&s;e payments, the mortgages were to be in&s;tantly foreclo&s;ed, the fir&s;t payments to be for|feited, and the grants to become void. It was al&s;o provided "That the lands to be conveyed by vir|tue of the act &s;hould be free from taxation till the inhabitants of them &s;hould come to be repre&s;ent|ed in the legi&s;lature of the &s;tate<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the act. Appendix No. 11.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The depo&s;its were made accordingly, and the grants pa&s;&s;ed in pur&s;uance of the act. Before the fir&s;t of November, the final payments were completed, and the mortgages taken up. The companies afterwards proceeded to &s;ell parts of this land to various per|&s;ons in New-York, Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts, South-Caroli|na, and el&s;ewhere, for valuable con&s;iderations.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be remarked that previous to this act, the various companies had made formal propo&s;als
<PB N="16" REF="035588_0018_1005F764C75551C0">to the legi&s;lature for the purcha&s;e of the lands; which were accepted and a bill pa&s;&s;ed thro' both hou&s;es accordingly. But the governor, judging the&s;e terms not &s;ufficiently advantageous to the &s;tate, refu&s;ed his a&s;&s;ent to the bill, and &s;tated his objections at large. Another bill was immediately framed &s;o as to obviate the mo&s;t material of the&s;e objections. It was pa&s;&s;ed, and received his &s;anc|tion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See appendix No. 2. clau&s;e of the repealing act, which recites the&s;e facts.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The whole &s;um of money paid into the trea&s;ury of Georgia, on account of the&s;e purcha&s;es, was five hundred thou&s;and dollars. Of this &s;um one hundred thou&s;and dollars were appropriated by laws of the &s;tate di&s;tinct from the abovementioned act, and per&s;uant to tho&s;e appropriations were ac|tually expended in the cour&s;e of the year 1795<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See appendix No. 3.

<P>From this view of the &s;ubject it &s;eems &s;ufficient|ly clear that no part of this country, above a line drawn due ea&s;t from the mouth of the Yazoo to the Apalachicola, belonged to the United States,
<PB N="17" REF="035588_0019_1005F76750AB97E8">at the time of the &s;ale. This it is believed will appear, in a &s;atisfactory manner, from an atten|tive examination of their claim, under all the points of view in which it &s;eems capable of being pre&s;ented.</P>
<P>There are but three foundations on which the claims of the United States, in this country can re&s;t.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place it may be contended, that tho&s;e clau&s;es in the proclamation of 1763, by which the &s;ale and &s;ettlement of land in the colo|nies were re&s;tricted to the heads of the rivers fal|ling into the Atlantic, from the we&s;t north-we&s;t, did in fact curtail the extent of the colonies, and reduce them from the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi to a line drawn from north-ea&s;t to &s;outh-we&s;t, thro' the heads of tho&s;e rivers: and that this line having thus become their we&s;tern boundary, all the lands beyond it mu&s;t be con&s;idered as wa&s;te territories of the crown, not &s;ubject to any colonial juri&s;diction; in which ca&s;e they mu&s;t have been ve&s;ted in the United States by the ce&s;&s;ion from Great-Britain in the treaty of peace.</P>
<P>In order to decide how far this principle is well-founded; it will be proper to advert to the words of the proclamation it&s;elf; to the manner in which the Briti&s;h government acted under it before the revolution: and to the con&s;truction which it has received from the &s;everal &s;tates, and the govern|ment of the United States, &s;ince they became in|dependant.</P>
<P>From a careful review of the proclamation it|&s;elf, and a compari&s;on of the various parts with each other, it &s;eems evident that the clau&s;es in que&s;tion were intended, not as a re&s;triction of the territorial limits of the colonies, but <HI>an in&s;truc|tion to the governors re&s;pecting the time, place, and manner, of granting lands and making &s;ettlements.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="035588_0020_1005F76A8D0CCA30">
The proclamation appears to have had five ob|jects in view. 1. To erect certain new govern|ments compo&s;ed of the territories which Great-Britain had recently acquired by her treaties of peace, with France and Spain. 2. To annex cer|tain additional territories to &s;ome of the govern|ments, then exi&s;ting. 3. To reward the land and naval forces of Britain, which had &s;erved in Ame|rica during the war, by an allotment of land in the colonies. 4. To protect the Indians in the &s;afe and quiet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;uch lands as it was thought proper to re&s;erve for their u&s;e and: 5. To regulate trade between them and the coloni&s;ts. There is no hint of an intention to re&s;trict the li|mits of the colonies by a line drawn thro' the heads of the rivers, or in any other manner. Had that been the intention of the Briti&s;h government, it would probably have been expre&s;sly declared; it having always been its practice to make alterations in the boundaries of its provinces in a very expre&s;s and &s;olemn manner, and u&s;ually in con&s;equence of repre&s;entations from the board of trade and plantations. This was the ca&s;e in the exten&s;ion of Georgia to the river St. Mary's, by this very proclamation, and of We&s;t Florida, to the mouth of the Yazoo afterwards; both which took place in con&s;equence of recommendations from the board of trade<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Act. gen. report 135, 133. And appendix No. 2. &amp; 3.</NOTE>. It being intended al&s;o to extend the governments of Novia Scotia, and Newfound|land, the exten&s;ions were made by this proclama|tion in the mo&s;t expre&s;s and formal manner. It does not therefore &s;eem in the lea&s;t degree proba|ble, that &s;o important a mea&s;ure as the cutting off one half of all the colonies, tho&s;e at lea&s;t which were royal governments, if intended, &s;hould have
<PB N="19" REF="035588_0021_1005EBE79E18A6A0">been left to mere implication; to expre&s;&s;ions, which even taken &s;ingly, many bear a very dif|ferent import.</P>
<P>The clau&s;es which contain tho&s;e expre&s;&s;ions, are confined to the fourth object of the proclamation, which they appear to have had &s;olely in view, viz. "To protect the Indians, in the, &s;afe and quiet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;uch lands as it was thought proper to re&s;erve for their u&s;e." They are introduced by a preamble, which &s;tates, "That it was ju&s;t and rea&s;onable, and e&s;&s;ential to the intere&s;ts and &s;ecu|rity of the Briti&s;h government and its colonies, that the &s;everal nations or tribes of Indians with whom it was connected, and who lived under its protec|tion, &s;hould not be di&s;turbed or mole&s;ted in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of &s;uch parts of its dominions and terri|tories, as not having been ceded to, or purcha&s;|ed by it, were re&s;erved to them or any of them, <HI>as their hunting grounds."</HI> In order to prevent this di&s;turbance and mole&s;tation, various mea&s;ures, are adopted. Fir&s;t the governors of Quebec, Ea&s;t Flori|da, and We&s;t Florida, the three new governments, are forbidden to grant any warrants of &s;urvey, or patents for lands, beyond the bounds of their re|&s;pective governments." Secondly the governors of the other colonies are forbidden, <HI>"For the pre|&s;ent</HI> and <HI>until the further plea&s;ure</HI> of <HI>the crown &s;hould be known,</HI> to grant warrants of &s;urvey or pa&s;s pa|tents for any lands <HI>beyond the heads or &s;ources</HI> of <HI>any</HI> of <HI>the rivers, which fall into the Atlantic ocean, from the we&s;t, or north-we&s;t;</HI> or upon any lands, which not having been ceded to, or purcha&s;ed by the crown, were re&s;erved to the Indians or any of them." Thirdly all the lands not included within the limits of the three new governments, or of the Had&s;ons Bay Company; and "all the lands and territories lying to the we&s;tward of the &s;ources of
<PB N="20" REF="035588_0022_1005F76E653AC300">the rivers, which fall into the &s;ea from the we&s;t and north-we&s;t," were declared to be re&s;erved, <HI>for the pre&s;ent,</HI> under the &s;overeignty, protection, and dominion of the crown, for the u&s;e of the Indians. And all per&s;ons were forbidden from making any purcha&s;es or &s;ettlements, or taking po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of any lands within tho&s;e re&s;ervations. Fourthly, all per|&s;ons, who, either wilfully or inadvertently, had &s;eated them&s;elves upon any of the land &s;o re&s;erv|ed, or upon any other land which, not having been ceded to or purcha&s;ed by the crown, were &s;till re|&s;erved for the Indians, were ordered immediately to remove. And fifthly, it was provided that in future "no private per&s;on &s;hould pre&s;ume to make any purcha&s;e from the Indians of any lands re&s;erv|ed to them <HI>within tho&s;e parts of the colonies where the crown had allowed &s;ettlement,</HI> but that if the Indi|ans &s;hould at any time be inclined to &s;ell &s;uch lands they &s;hould be purcha&s;ed only for the crown and in its name, at &s;ome public meeting of the Indians held for that purpo&s;e, by the governor of the co|lony re&s;pectively within which they lay. And in ca&s;e they &s;hould lie within the limits of any pro|prietaries, then conformable to &s;uch in&s;tructions as the crown or the proprietaries &s;hould give."</P>
<P>On the&s;e regulations it is ob&s;ervable, in the fir&s;t place, that they are all parts of a &s;y&s;tem the avow|ed object and &s;cope of which was to protect the In|dians, not to alter or abridge the limits of colo|nies. To this object all of them were important; nor was that which re&s;pected the lands we&s;t of the heads of the rivers le&s;s &s;o than any of the others. As tho&s;e lands lay at a great di&s;tance from the &s;et|tled parts of the colonies, they were beyond the reach of protection from the colonial governments; and it was therefore important that they &s;hould, while re&s;erved for the Indians, be taken under the
<PB N="21" REF="035588_0023_1005F771F2546E10">immediate protection of the crown, which po&s;&s;e&s;&s;|ing a military force upon the frontiers could more readily and effectually repel tho&s;e inroads and in|croachments which it was the object of this &s;y&s;tem to prevent. The lands below the &s;ources of the rivers on the contrary, being nearer to the &s;eats of the colonial governments, might derive the nece&s;&s;a|ry protection from that &s;ource.</P>
<P>As to the terms "&s;overeignty and dominion of the crown" which are applied to the lands above the heads of the rivers, they mean nothing; for all parts of the colonies were equally under the &s;ov|reignty and dominion of the crown, the proprieta|ry governments excepted. Even they were &s;o to many intents, and where they were exempted from &s;overeignty by their charters, it was not in the power of the crown to bring them under it again by a proclamation.</P>
<P>It is to be remarked, in the &s;econd place, that this "&s;overeignty, protection, and dominion" were only to be "for the pre&s;ent" and while the lands were "re&s;erved for the u&s;e of the Indians." It was therefore a temporary regulation; not a per|manent change in the limits of a province, and was to cea&s;e as &s;oon as the Indians &s;hould think fit to relinqui&s;h the lands, and the crown to permit the &s;ettlement of them. They were then to be under the government of that colony within who&s;e limits they lay; to form part of it as before.</P>
<P>The &s;ame remark is applicable to the prohibition again&s;t granting warrants or patents for lands a|bove the heads of the rivers. It was only for the pre&s;ent" that they were prohibited: which &s;hows that the prohibition was a temporary regulation on|ly, the lands &s;till continuing a part of the colonies re&s;pectively to which they belonged before, and the governors of which, when the prohibition &s;hould
<PB N="22" REF="035588_0024_1005F77384045DB8">be removed, would go on to grant the lands as formerly.</P>
<P>It is remarkable in the third place, that the pro|clamation &s;peaks of "lands re&s;erved for the Indi|ans within tho&s;e parts of the colonies where the crown had thought proper to allow &s;ettlement" and tho&s;e lands whenever the Indians &s;hould be di&s;po&s;|ed to &s;ell them, were to be purcha&s;ed by the go|vernors in the name of the crown and for its u&s;e. Settlements were therefore permitted in parts of the colonies where the lands had been re&s;erved for the Indians! This could apply only to lands be|low the heads of the rivers which had not been purcha&s;ed or ceded; for above the heads of the rivers &s;ettlement was ab&s;olutely prohibited; and it proves that "to re&s;erve lands far the Indians," did not take them out of the limits of the colony. There were al&s;o <HI>parts of the colonies</HI> where &s;ettlement was forbidden. This could apply only to the lands above the heads of the rivers; for below them, &s;et|tlement was permitted, provided the land was pre|viou&s;ly purcha&s;ed from the Indians. Con&s;equent|ly the lands above the heads of the rivers, though re&s;erved for the Indians under the &s;pecial protec|tion of the crown, and forbidden to be &s;ettled without its expre&s;s licen&s;e, were neverthele&s;s con|&s;idered as "parts of the colonies," within who&s;e former limits they lay.</P>
<P>The difference made by the proclamation be|tween the lands above, and tho&s;e below the heads of the rivers, &s;eems to be this, that both continu|ing to be part of the colonies, the latter might be &s;ettled whenever they could be purcha&s;ed from the Indians conformably the e&s;tabli&s;hed regula|tions: whereas the former, however willing the Indians might be, could not be &s;ettled or purcha&s;ed without the expre&s;s permi&s;&s;ion of the crown: the
<PB N="23" REF="035588_0025_1005F776E7ECBBD0">rea&s;ons of which di&s;tinction have been hinted at above, and indeed are &s;ufficiently obvious.</P>
<P>It is to be ob&s;erved in the la&s;t place, that the&s;e provi&s;ions extend to all the colonies, both royal and proprietary: &s;ome of which la&s;t de&s;cription, particularly Penn&s;ylvania, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed exten&s;ive terri|tories beyond the heads of the rivers, which fall into the Atlantic from the we&s;t and north-we&s;t. Although the crown might, and frequently did, execute a general &s;uperintending power over the proprietary governments, as well as its other colo|nies might regulate their trade, protect the Indians, and pre&s;cribe the manner in which lands &s;hould be purcha&s;ed or &s;ettled; it certainly neither had, or, claimed a right to alter, much le&s;s curtail their limits. This is evident from the whole tenor of its conduct, re&s;pecting the colonies, as well as from the nature of the proprietary charters them|&s;elves; which being in the nature of grants inve&s;t|ed the proprietors with the right of &s;oil. This right the crown could no more take from them then it could deprive indiviuals of any other pro|perty which they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed and accordingly we have &s;een that it never meddled with the Virginia ter|ritory until the company's charter had been legal|ly vacated by a quo warranto. Nor was it till af|ter the council of Plymouth<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Hazard's col. vol. i. p. 390. al&s;o act p. 11, 12, 13.</NOTE>, the lords proprietors of Carolina, and the tru&s;tees of Georgia, had re|&s;pectively &s;urrendered their charters, that the crown proceeded to make any di&s;po&s;ition of their territories. It can hardly be pre&s;umed that it would &s;o &s;uddenly have departed from its con&s;tant maxims of conduct, and from the known princi|ples of its laws, as to attempt regulations by which the proprietary government of Penn&s;ylvania would have been deprived at once of nearly half its ter|ritories.
<PB N="24" REF="035588_0026_1005F7796350C580">Yet this mu&s;t have been the effect of the clau&s;es in que&s;tion had they been con&s;idered as a re&s;triction of limits, rather than temporary in&s;truc|tion to the governors.</P>
<P>It is moreover an invarible rule in the expo&s;i|tion of legal acts, that in ca&s;e of ambiguity any con&s;truction by which they can be rendered con&s;i&s;|tent with right is to be preferred. But to con&s;ider the&s;e clau&s;es as a re&s;triction of boundary, would render them directly repugnant to the plain and acknowledged rights of the proprietary govern|ments. Whereas to regard them merely as in|&s;tructions to the governors re&s;pecting the time and manner of making &s;ettlements, will reconcile them equally to the rights of the proprietors and of the crown: and this is the intention with which the proclamation, con&s;idered in it&s;elf, and taken un|der all the&s;e points of view, appears to have been made</P>
<P>The con&s;truction thus obviou&s;ly deducible from the words and tenor of the in&s;trument it&s;elf, is &s;trongly &s;upported by the conduct of the Briti&s;h government, before the revolution. It mu&s;t here be repeated and con&s;tantly keep in view, that the&s;e provi&s;ions extended, not only to South-Carolina, and Georgia, but to all the colonies who&s;e terri|tories lay above and below the heads of the rivers, falling in the Atlantic from the we&s;t and north|we&s;t of this number, were New-York, Penn&s;ylva|nia, Virginia, and North-Carolina; be&s;ides South-Carolina, and Georgia. It is perfectly well known that between the proclamation of 1763, and the revolution, at a time when the Briti&s;h go|vernment &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ted in Virginia, &s;he extended her &s;ettlements beyond the heads of the rivers, falling into the Atlantic. Many of the &s;ettlements or Pol&s;ton, New River, Greenbriar, and other waters falling into the Ohio, were of this de&s;crip|tion,
<PB N="25" REF="035588_0027_1005F77AF28FA250">and they were made not only with the per|mi&s;&s;ion, but under the authority, of the Briti&s;h go|vernment. It is not known at what time the grants of land were made under which the&s;e &s;et|tlements took place but it is perfectly certain that the &s;ettlements them&s;elves were always con&s;idered, as well after the proclamation as before, as being part of Virginia and that the laws were admini&s;tered in them, under the authority, and in the name of its colonial government. This, it is mo&s;t evident, could not have been the ca&s;e, had the proclama|tion of 1763, been con&s;idered as curtailing the co|lonies, and re&s;tricting them to a line drawn thro' the heads of the rivers. In that ca&s;e the&s;e &s;ettle|ments, &s;o far from going on and increa&s;ing under the government of Virginia, mu&s;t have been cut off from the colony; and the exerci&s;e of authority there by its governor, would have been regarded as an act of u&s;urpation. But his we know was not the ca&s;e. If Virginia was not curtailed neither were the other colonies; for the clau&s;es in que&s;tion apply equally to them all. From whence it is mo&s;t evident that the crown con&s;idered, and intend|ed the&s;e clau&s;es as no more then a temporary in|&s;triction to its governors about the time and man|ner of making &s;ettlements; the extent and boun|daries of the colonies, when it &s;hould permit &s;et|tlements, remaining &s;till the &s;ame.</P>
<P>It is equally clear that the &s;ubject has always been viewed in the &s;ame light by the &s;tates them|&s;elves &s;ince the revolution, and by the government of the United States. Not to &s;peak of Georgia, which, as we have already &s;een, pa&s;&s;ed an act in 1783, to declare and e&s;tabli&s;h her territorial li|mits, it is well known, that South-Carolina grant|ed large grantees of land thro' all the country from the mountains to the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi, which grants &s;he afterwards vacated, not becau&s;e &s;he had
<PB N="26" REF="035588_0028_1005F77E93D502D8">no right to make them, but becau&s;e the land had not been purcha&s;ed from the Indians. She after|wards ceded her claim to the United States. North-Carolina too opened a land-office in 1784, and granted &s;everal millions of acres between the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi, and the heads of the rivers which fall into the Atlantic. She afterwards ceded the terri|tory to the United States, &s;ubject to the&s;e grants; and &s;ubject to them it was accepted; nor was the validity of the grants, except &s;o far as related to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ory right of the Indians, ever been di&s;|puted. Indeed the whole &s;tate of Tene&s;&s;ee is held by this very tenure. Before the ce&s;&s;ion this county was con&s;idered as part of North-Carolina, as &s;uch was governed, and as &s;uch had a repre&s;en|tative in the Congre&s;s of the United States. In the &s;ame manner, Virginia &s;old the whole Kentucky country, and then erected it into a &s;tate; it having remained in the mean time, under her laws, and a part of her &s;tate for many years; many and exten|&s;ive di&s;tricts, which &s;till con&s;titute parts of Virginia, and as &s;uch &s;end members to Congre&s;s, lie beyond the heads of the rivers which fall into the Atlan|tic. All the&s;e &s;ettlements, grants, and ce&s;&s;ions, have proceeded upon the principle that the we&s;tern limits of the colonies were not altered by the pro|clamation of 1763. Otherwi&s;e all the grants of North-Carolina in Tene&s;&s;ee, and of Virginia in Kentucky, would be illegal; and a very con&s;ider|able part of the territory &s;till claimed and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the latter &s;tate, mu&s;t be lopt off from her.</P>
<P>Until therefore it &s;hall be &s;hewn that the clau&s;es in que&s;tion apply exclu&s;ively to South-Carolina, and Georgia, or that the &s;ame rules of con&s;truction which have been univer&s;ally adopted and admitted, with re&s;pect to the other &s;tates, ought not to ap|ply to them likewi&s;e, it &s;eems perfectly clear that
<PB N="27" REF="035588_0029_1005F78101190568">whether we regard the proclamation of 1763, it&s;elf the acts of the Briti&s;h governments under it, or the con&s;truction which has been given to it by own governments &s;ince the revolution, it cannot be con&s;idered as having curtailed the we&s;tern boun|dary of tho&s;e &s;tates.</P>
<P>From whence it re&s;ults that the United Stares, can found no claim to the lands in que&s;tion, on this proclamation.</P>
<P>Their claim however, to the&s;e lands, or a part of them, is &s;upported on another principle which mu&s;t be next examined. It is &s;aid that altho' Ca|rolina, originally extended as far &s;outh as Florida, yet when the proprietors &s;urrendered their charter, and the&s;e territories became re-ve&s;ted in the crown, the &s;outhern limits of that province were re&s;trict|ed by the e&s;tabli&s;hment of Georgia: that the ri|vers Savannah, and Alatamaha, having been fit as the limits of Georgia, all the lands &s;outh o &s;t were cut off from the government of South-Caro|lina, and continued to be wa&s;te territories of the crown, till part of them were annext to Georgia by the proclamation of &s;ixty three: that this pro|clamation however, extending only to the lands, "between the Alatamaha, and the St. Mary's," could not include the territory which lay above the heads of tho&s;e rivers; and that this territory there|fore continued to be wa&s;te land, not annext to any government, nor part of any colony, till the treaty of peace, by which it was ve&s;ted in the United &s;tates By this preten&s;ion, if e&s;tabli&s;hed, they would gain all the country, bounded by the Floridas, the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi, and a line drawn from the head of the St. Mary's, to that of the Alatamaha, and from thence due we&s;t to the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi.</P>
<P>Nothing can be more uncertain than the lati|tude of this la&s;t line. If the po&s;ition of the &s;ources,
<PB N="28" REF="035588_0030_1005F7828F97CE58">of the Alatamaha were known, which is very far from being the ca&s;e, it would &s;till be very diffi|cult to a&s;certain what ought to be con&s;idered as the head of the river: whether the place where it takes the name of the Alatamaha, its nighe&s;t &s;ource from the &s;ea, or its mo&s;t &s;outhern &s;ource, be intended by the charter as the place from where the we&s;t line is to be drawn. It has been thought that the mo&s;t Southern &s;ource is meant; but this is far from being fully ju&s;tified by the words of the char|ter, which evidently refer to the mo&s;t &s;outhern <HI>mouth</HI> of the river; it being known to enter the &s;ea by &s;everal channels. The words are, "From the mo&s;t northern &s;tream, of a river, there com|monly called the Savannah, all along the &s;ea coa&s;t, to the &s;outhward, to the mo&s;t &s;outhern &s;tream of a certain other great water or river, called the Alatamaha, and we&s;tward, from the heads of of the &s;aid rivers re&s;pectively to the South-Sea." It: &s;eems probable however, that the <HI>highe&s;t &s;ource from the &s;ea,</HI> was the point from whence the we&s;t line was intended to be drawn: and tho' this &s;ource will remain for a long time uncertain, even &s;hould the claim be e&s;tabli&s;hed, yet it may be af|firmed not to lie &s;o far north, as to affect the pur|cha&s;e of the upper Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi company, who&s;e mo&s;t &s;outhern extent is no more than twenty-five miles &s;outh of the north boundary of Georgia.</P>
<P>The claim however, could certainly include a great, perhaps far the greater part of the Geor|gia company's purcha&s;e.</P>
<P>This claim re&s;ts on two que&s;tions. 1. Whether the lands &s;outh of Georgia, continued to be a part of South-Carolina, after the former colony was erected? 2. Whether the whole of them were an|next to Georgia, by the proclamation of 1763, or that part only which lay below the heads of the Alatamaha, and St. Mary's. If they continued to
<PB N="29" REF="035588_0031_1005F7851F086988">be part of South-Carolina, the ce&s;&s;ion of that &s;tate, by the convention of Beaufort, ve&s;ted in Georgia &s;uch parts of them as were not affected by the pro|clamation of 1763. If they were all affected by that proclamation, then the right of Georgia was complete independantly of the ce&s;&s;ion from South-Carolina.</P>
<P>As to the fir&s;t point, it is to be regretted that more &s;atisfactory documents for the inve&s;tigation of it, cannot be re&s;orted to. The papers mo&s;t likely to decide it with ab&s;olute certainty, are the commi&s;&s;ions and in&s;tructions, given to the govern|ors of South-Carolina, between the years 1732, when the colony of Georgia, was erected and 1763, the date of the proclamation. Tho&s;e docu|ments no doubt exi&s;t in the office of trade, and plantations in London. An official enquiry was made from a gentleman having acce&s;s to the re|cords of that office, and he furni&s;hed &s;ome extracts and copies; but others of a very important nature were omitted. From &s;uch documents however, as can be recurred to the following points &s;eem to be &s;atisfactorily e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t that after the &s;urrender of their charter by the Lords Proprietors, the juri&s;diction of the Royal governors of South Carolina extended over the whole country which had been included in that charter</P>
<P>It appears by a repre&s;entation from the board of trade and plantations to the king, on the 1&s;t of December 1727 that a fort was at that time kept up on the Alatamaha river under the government of South Carolina, and had been for &s;ome years; and the continuation of it under the &s;ame authority is advi&s;ed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Att. gen. rep ort, 30.</NOTE>. And on the 10th of June, 1730; the governor of South Carolina was in&s;tructed to lay out Town&s;hips and grant lands on the Alata|meha<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. 70.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="035588_0032_1005F7879A2E6480">
Secondly that when the Colony of Georgia was erected the country of which it was compo&s;ed was con&s;idered by the Briti&s;h government as part of South-Carolina.</P>
<P>Lord Percival, Oglethorpe and others who fir&s;t projected the Georgia &s;cheme, petitioned the crown for a grant of land <HI>in South-Carolina,</HI> for that purpo&s;e<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Att. gen. rep. 84.</NOTE>. In the reports of the board of trade on this petition, Georgia is called "the colony to be e&s;tabli&s;hed; in South-Carolina<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. 87</NOTE>." After the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the colony the command of its militia was to <HI>remain</HI> with the governor of South-Carolina.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. 912</NOTE>Even in the charter, the lands to be in|cluded are de&s;cribed as "lying and being in that part of South-Carolina in America which lies &amp;c."<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. 91.</NOTE>. Lord Granville's part of South-Carolina not having, at that time, been &s;eparately allotted to him, his right in this country as one of the pro|prietors, was admitted &s;till to exi&s;t; and according|ly the charter granted only &s;even eighths of the land to the tru&s;tees<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. 100.</NOTE>, to whom Lord Grenville afterwards conveyed his eighth. And in an in|&s;truction to the Governor of South-Carolina, of a date &s;ub&s;equent to the charter, Georgia is mention|ed as "a Colony &s;ettled within the bounds of the province of South-Carolina" and the governor of that province is in&s;tructed to regi&s;ter the charter among its records<NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">Ibid. 95.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Thirdly, that after the e&s;tabli&s;hment of Georgia the lands &s;outh of its &s;outhern boundary &s;till re|mained, and were con&s;idered by the crown as be|ing, under the juri&s;diction of South-Carolina, and of con&s;equence a part of that province.</P>
<P>It apperas by a repre&s;entation from the governor of Georgia, dated October 17th 1761, that there
<PB N="31" REF="035588_0033_1005F78AF6BC92C0">was then, and long had been a military po&s;t kept up on Cumberland I&s;land, far &s;outh of the Alata|maha, "under the direction and authority of the governor of South-Carolina<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Att. gen Rep. 111.</NOTE>". The governor of South-Carolina too, in a letter to the board of trade dated Augu&s;t 17th 1763, affirms that there was then, and had been for many years, a po&s;t to the &s;outh|ward of the Alatamaha garri&s;oned by detachments from that province<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. 118.</NOTE>. But this point is more &s;trongly confirmed by the proceedings which took place with re&s;pect to certain lands lying &s;outh of the Alatamaha and granted by the governor of South-Carolina in the year 1762. The&s;e grants being complained of by the governor of Gorgia, the board of trade and plantations reproved the governor of South-Carolina for making them; not on the ground of his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing no juri&s;diction, but becau&s;e "the making of grants for lands in that country was contrary to the intentions of the crown, and might not only embarra&s;s the execution of tho&s;e arrangements which would probably be|come nece&s;&s;ary from the ce&s;&s;ion of Florida, but in|terfere al&s;o with the mea&s;ures about to be taken for the exten&s;ion of Gorgia<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. 115.</NOTE>. The governor ju&s;tified his conduct by alledging that his province &s;till extended as far &s;outh as the limits fixt by the charter of Carolina to the lords proprietors, except as to &s;uchland as had been expre&s;sly included with|in the charter of Georgia<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. 117.</NOTE>. In a &s;ub&s;equ&eacute;nt re|pre&s;entation from the board of trade to the crown they &s;eem to admit that the&s;e grants were made "conformably to the governors in&s;tructions<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. 144.</NOTE>." And they expre&s;sly recommend that an act of the Georgia legi&s;lature, pa&s;&s;ed after that province had been extended to the St. Marys and tending to
<PB N="32" REF="035588_0034_1005F78D9EECB7B0">&s;ubject the grantees of tho&s;e lands to improper conditions, &s;hould not receive the royal a&s;&s;ent<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Att. gen. Rep. 141</NOTE>. Tran&s;cripts of tho&s;e grants were afterwards ordered by the crown to be regi&s;tered in Georgia<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. 144.</NOTE>. And the grants them&s;elves thus virtually confirmed, have ever &s;ince been, and &s;till are, con&s;idered as valid.</P>
<P>All the&s;e proceedings mu&s;t have been founded on the principle that the lands &s;outh of the South|ern boundary of Georgia, as fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hed by its charter, continued to be a part of South-Carolina till the proclamation of 1763, annext them or part of them at lea&s;t, to the former province.</P>
<P>How indeed could they cea&s;e to be &s;o? nothing is more clear then that all this country was includ|ed within the province of South-Carolina at and before the e&s;tabli&s;hment of Georgia. This has been abundantly proved<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Sapaa. p. 55, 56 57,</NOTE>. But the charter of Georgia could affect tho&s;e lands only which were included within its limits; nor was that province ever under&s;tood, either by its own governors or the crown, to extend further<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">See Att. gen. rep. 111, 105.115.135.140.</NOTE>. All the re&s;t of the country, of cour&s;e, remained as it was before, until a further de&s;po&s;ition of it was made by &s;ome new act of the crown. It is not pretended that any &s;uch acts took place till the proclamation of 1763<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. 18 117.</NOTE>. The circum&s;tance of this country being &s;epa|rated from the re&s;t of Carolina by the intervening province of Georgia does not alter the ca&s;e: for it is by no means nece&s;&s;ary, nor does it always happen, that all the territories of a government &s;hould lie adjoining. The province of Maine we know, un|der the royal government was, and at this day continues to be, a part of Ma&s;&s;achu&s;&s;etts, tho' New-Hamp&s;hire lies between them; and Connecti|cut
<PB N="33" REF="035588_0035_1005F78F4F6B4BD0">by virtue of her charter, which extended we&s;t to the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi, claims and actually holds, lands on lake Erie, notwith&s;tanding that New-York, New-Jer&s;ey, and Penn&s;ylvania intervene.</P>
<P>There are however two pa&s;&s;ages which might &s;eem at fir&s;t view to contradict this opinion; but it is believed that on examination they will apppear in a different light.</P>
<P>In a report to the crown by the board of trade and plantations, on which the proclamation of 1763 was founded, it is &s;tated "that a large tract of land lying between the North boundary of Ea&s;t Florida and the river Alatamaha, <HI>which had hi|herto been unoccupied as to any permament &s;ettlement,</HI> remained to be put under &s;ome proper e&s;tabli&s;h|ment<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Att. gen. rep. 135.</NOTE>".</P>
<P>On this pa&s;&s;age it is to be ob&s;erved that <HI>occupation</HI> and <HI>right</HI> are di&s;tinct things; &s;o that the circum|&s;tance of this country's not having been occupied by South-Carolina, would by no means prove that it was not under the juri&s;diction, did not from part, of that province. It is not &s;aid, moreover, that this country had not been occupied at all; that would have been contrary to the fact; for as we have &s;een, a po&s;t had been kept up in it and gar|ri&s;oned from South-Carolina; but that it had not been occupied <HI>as to permament &s;ettlement.</HI> But it is a well known principle of law that a legal po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion where nece&s;&s;ary, may be maintained without a permanent &s;ettlement. Had actual po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion in this ca&s;e been nece&s;&s;ary, which may well be doubt|ed, the continued occupation by a military po&s;t would have been &s;ufficient.</P>
<P>The board of trade is &s;aid to have laid the above-mentioned grants before the crown lawyers, for an opinion on their validity, and to have alledged at the &s;ame time "that the province of South-Carolina
<PB N="34" REF="035588_0036_1005F792A8591A00">did not appear, at any time, either when under the government of the proprietors, or &s;ince it had been in the hands of the crown, to have ex|erci&s;ed any juri&s;diction in the country &s;outh of the Alatamaha, or taken any po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Att. gen. rep. 20.</NOTE></P>
<P>It is to be remarked in the fir&s;t place, that the crown lawyers did not give an opinion, at lea&s;t not an unfavourable one, on the &s;ubject of the&s;e grants: from whence it may be inferred that after an ex|amination of the &s;ubject, they did not concur in the objections of the board. Secondly, that the a&s;&s;ertion of the board, even if true, amounts to nothing; the right to po&s;&s;e&s;s, and the exerci&s;e of that right, being things altogether di&s;tinct. And thirdly, that the a&s;&s;ertion is not true; it being evi|dent from the documents already adduced that the province of South-Carolina had always maintained po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that country, at lea&s;t till the year 1762, by a military po&s;t.</P>
<P>It &s;eems therefore clearly to re&s;ult from all the&s;e con&s;iderations that the country &s;outh of the Alata|maha not only was a part of South-Carolina pre|viou&s;ly to the e&s;tabli&s;hment of Georgia, but conti|nued to be &s;o afterwards until the proclamation of 1763. The facts &s;tated indeed relate wholly to the country near the &s;ea coa&s;t, becau&s;e that alone hav|ing been &s;ettled by the Engli&s;h or even known to them, the interior parts were never expre&s;sly con|templated by the acts of their government. But the principles on which tho&s;e acts were founded apply equally to every part of the territory &s;outh of the ancient &s;outhern boundary of Georgia. South-Carolina could claim near the coa&s;t in virtue only of her charter, and that charter gave an equal claim to all the land contained within its limits and not included in tho&s;e of Georgia. The right therefore which they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed on the &s;hores of the
<PB N="35" REF="035588_0037_1005F79505725920">Atlantic before the year 1763, extended equally to the banks of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi, and by her ce&s;&s;ion at Beaufort in 1788, was completely ve&s;ted in the &s;tate of Georgia.</P>
<P>As to the &s;econd point, whether the proclama|tion of 1763, annexed to Georgia all the land ly|ing between her ancient &s;outhern boundary and the northern limits of the Floridas, or &s;uch part only as actually lay between the Alatamaha and St. Mary's below their &s;ources? the dici&s;ion of it, if now nece&s;&s;ary, might be attended with &s;ome dif|ficulty. The words of the proclamation are "We have al&s;o, with the advice of our privy council afore&s;aid, annexed to our province of Georgia, all the lands lying between the rivers Alatamaha and St. Mary's<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Att. gen rep. 38.</NOTE>." Nothing el&s;e is &s;aid on the &s;ubject. From the&s;e expre&s;&s;ions, and &s;ome others u&s;ed by the board of trade and plantations in different com|munications<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid. 135.140.</NOTE>to the crown on this matter, it would &s;eem that tho&s;e lands only which lay below the heads of the rivers were contemplated. But this point &s;eems to have been decided, as far as relates to the United States, by the government it&s;elf. In a report from the Secretary of State, intended as the ba&s;is of in&s;tructions to our commi&s;&s;ioners for treating with Spain, the latitude 31, is in&s;i&s;ted on as the &s;outhern boundary of Georgia "e&s;tabli&s;hed between that province and Florida by the procla|mation of 1763<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Appendix, No. 9. An extract from the repre&s;entation.</NOTE>." And in the repre&s;entation made by our commi&s;&s;ioners December 17th 1793, the &s;ame thing is repeated, and urged to the court of Spain as the foundation of our right.<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">The &s;ame principle is repeated, and urged on the court of Spain, by Mr Pinckney, the American mini&s;ter for negociating the la&s;t treaty with that power, &s;o lately as Augu&s;t 10th, 1795, &s;everal months after the &s;ales in que&s;tion had been formally notifie to the government. See app. No. 16.

<PB N="36" REF="035588_0038_1005F79694080D40">perhaps be thought doubtful how far the&s;e decla|tions would preclude the government in a court of law; but we can hardly &s;uppo&s;e that it would con|tend for a principle formally and expre&s;sly contra|dicted by its own &s;olemn acts; which it mu&s;t do were it to urge a claim again&s;t the &s;tate of Geor|gia for any of the&s;e lands, founded on a &s;uppo&s;i|tion that the whole of them, down to the Mi&s;&s;i&s;|&s;ippi and the latitude 31, were not annexed to that &s;tate by the proclamation in que&s;tion.</P>
<P>The third and only remaining ground on which the United States can re&s;t their claim to a part of this territory, is the exten&s;ion of We&s;t Florida after the year 1763.</P>
<P>It is contended that the Briti&s;h crown having previou&s;ly to the year 1770, and while all the co|lonies were &s;ubject to its dominion, extended We&s;t Florida up to the mouth of the Yazoo and a line drawn due left from thence to the Apilachi|cola, by in&s;tructions and commi&s;&s;ions to its go|vernors, all the county between that line and the latitude 31, cea&s;ing to belong either to South-Ca|rolina or Georgia, became a part of We&s;t Florida, and being thus placed without the juri&s;diction of any &s;tate in the Union, was ceded, by the treaty of peace, to the United States.</P>
<P>Nothing can be more certain than the principle that all the lands ceded by Great Britain in the treaty of peace, and not included within the limits of any &s;tate, became ve&s;ted in the United States. Nor can there be any doubt that as both Carolina and Georgia were royal governments in the year 1770, the crown had a right at that time to alter, abridge, or extend their limits at its plea&s;ure; to take parts of their territories and annex them to old governments or erect them into new ones. It was by the exerci&s;e of this right that after Virginia became a royal government in 1624,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Supra, p. 9, 10.</NOTE> part of its
<PB N="37" REF="035588_0039_1005F79944E0B3F8">territory, all &s;outh of the latitude 36, 30, was included in the grant of Carolina: that after the &s;urrender by the lords proprietors, Carolina it&s;elf was divided into two governments, and Georgia carved out of one of them; and that the country &s;outh of the fir&s;t boundary e&s;tabli&s;hed for Georgia was afterwards annexed to that province.</P>
<P>As to the mode of exerci&s;ing this right there may be more room for doubt. It may be &s;aid that when the limits of a province had been fixed by a procla|mation or charter, which are public and &s;olemn acts, they ought not to be altered, and could not legally, by acts of <HI>a le&s;s &s;olemn</HI> nature; &s;uch as commi&s;&s;ions or in&s;tructions. But this objection does not &s;eem to have any weight; becau&s;e tho' commi&s;&s;ions and in&s;tructions, e&s;pecially the for|mer, were not publi&s;hed in the &s;ame manner with proclamations, they were neverthele&s;s publi&s;hed, and with circum&s;tances of &s;ufficient notority; being entered of record not only in the office of trade and plantations, but al&s;o in the provinces; where they were moreover publicly read. They received in|deed a greater degree of publicity than charters, which were recorded only, without being promul|gated in any manner. As to authenticity, the&s;e commi&s;&s;ions were acts of the king in council, un|der the great &s;eal, as well as proclamations or let|ters patent, and therefore of equal authority. As the crown, be&s;ides, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the right of altering boundaries it might certainly exerci&s;e that right in whatever manner it thought fit: and indeed the extent of the royal colonies depended, in many in&s;tances, on the commi&s;&s;ions to governors, and was regulated by them. Of this Virginia, Caro|lina, and Georgia, are examples; which after they became royal governments, were continued according to their ancient limits, not by new let|ters
<PB N="38" REF="035588_0040_1005F79C977E1960">patent, but merely by the commi&s;&s;ions to their re&s;pective governors.</P>
<P>It therefore &s;eems undeniable, that by this ex|ten&s;ion of Florida, the territory which it affected was entirely cut off from Georgia, or South-Ca|rolina, to which ever of them it belonged, and rendered completely a part of Florida; from which it nece&s;&s;arily follows that this territory was ceded by the treaty of peace to the United States, not to Georgia, and ve&s;ted in them.</P>
<P>As the mouth of the Yazoo, however, lies in latitude 32, 30<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the appendix, No. 6.&mdash;an extract from the repre&s;entation of Purcell, who &s;urveyed that country, under the authority of the Briti&s;h government.</NOTE>, or thereabout, it is clear that this claim of the United States does not affect the upper Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi commpany's purcha&s;e, which cannot extend further &s;outh than latitude 34, "30". But a very con&s;iderable part of the Geor|gia company's purcha&s;e, will lie below a line to be drawn due ea&s;t from the mouth of the Yazoo. Its &s;outhern boundary between the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi and Donbigby, is higher up than that line; namely in latitude 32, 40, but between the Donbigby and Alabama, it extends down nearly to latitude 31. In this quarter con&s;equently, a great part of its lands are included in the claim of the United States.</P>
<P>How far is this claim &s;till valid again&s;t the com|pany? Admitting that the&s;e lands belonged to the United States at the time of the &s;ale, was it attend|ed or preceded by any conduct on their part which will render it valid again&s;t them, in the eye of the law? This was the &s;econd point propo&s;ed for ex|amination.</P>
<P>On this point two que&s;tions ari&s;e which ought to be di&s;tinctly con&s;idered: fir&s;t whether the con|duct of the United States re&s;pecting this territory at the &s;ale, and previous to it, was &s;uch as, if
<PB N="39" REF="035588_0041_1005F79F288B7888">per&s;ued by an individual under &s;imilar circum&s;tan|ces, would have rendered the &s;ale binding on him? and &s;econdly whether the &s;ame principles will ap|ply to the government?</P>
<P>As to the fir&s;t, there is no rule better e&s;tabli&s;hed in the courts of equity than this, that whoever, knowingly and without con&s;traint, acquie&s;ces in a di&s;po&s;ition of his property, for a valuable con&s;i|deration, by a per&s;on who pretended and appear|ed to have the right, &s;hall be bound by the di&s;po&s;i|tion: it being a maxim of law, "That &s;ilence im|plies content; and that he who does'not forbid an act when he has a right, and an opportunity to do &s;o, orders it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Equi. ca. abr. 357.&mdash;ca&s;e of Hanning, v. Ferrets.</NOTE>." This rule rule has been long ad|mitted in the courts of equity, and is abundantly &s;upported by the authorities cited at the bottom<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Hud&s;den, v. Cheney, 2. Vern. 150.&mdash;Raw, v. Pole, 2 Vern. 239.&mdash;Ibbot&s;on, v. Rhodes, 2. Vern. 554.&mdash;Berrisford, v. Milward.&mdash;Barpard, Chan. 101, 102.&mdash;Peter, v. Ru&s;&s;el, 2.

<P>But he mu&s;t acquie&s;e "knowingly," that is he mu&s;t under&s;tand the nature of the act about to be done: for he is bound on the principle of having a&s;&s;ented; and a per&s;on cannot a&s;&s;ent to what he did not know. He mu&s;t al&s;o acquie&s;e, "without con&s;traint," for there can be no a&s;&s;ent where there is not freedom.</P>
<P>And the per&s;on who makes the di&s;po&s;ition, mu&s;t not only claim a right, but appear to po&s;&s;e&s;s it; for whoever &s;hould make a purcha&s;e from one who neither claimed, nor appeared to po&s;&s;e&s;s, a right to &s;ell, could blame none but him&s;elf, and mu&s;t &s;u&s;tain the lo&s;s as a puni&s;hment for his own folly.</P>
<P>But if the owner &s;hould not only acquie&s;e in the

This principle al&s;o is fully e&s;tabli&s;hed by the authorities already cited.</P>
<P>Let the&s;e rules be applied to the acts of the &s;tate of Georgia and the conduct of the United States re&s;pecting this territory, previou&s;ly to the &s;ale in que&s;tion. It will appear that the latter not only acquie&s;ed, but encouraged: that they not only &s;aw in &s;ilence all the acts of owner&s;hip exerci&s;ed by Georgia over this land, all her acts preparatory to the &s;ale, and the &s;ale it&s;elf, but by their own proceedings gave colour and &s;anction to her ti|tle.</P>
<P>As early as the year 1783, Georgia began to a&s;&s;ert her claim to the&s;e lands. In that year &s;he pa&s;&s;ed an act declaring them to lie within her char|ter-limits, and holding out encouragement to per|&s;ons to &s;ettle on them<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See the act, p. 19.</NOTE>. To this proceeding the United States made no objection.</P>
<P>In 1795, knowing that the Indian claims had been extingui&s;hed in a tract of land on the Mi&s;|&s;i&s;&s;ippi, below the mouth of the Yazoo, and be|lieving that extingui&s;hment, as it was within the limits &s;he claimed, to have enured to her benefit, &s;he erected that tract into a county, and offered new encouragement to &s;ettlers. She moreover, at the &s;ame time, declared her intention of open|ing a land office for the &s;ale of the lands<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid p. 19, 20.</NOTE>. To this proceeding the United States made no ob|jection.</P>
<P>Sometime afterwards a di&s;pute aro&s;e between the two &s;tates, South-Carolina, and Georgia, about
<PB N="41" REF="035588_0043_1005F7A349BB8FD8">this territory, and it was referred to congre&s;s; which thus received expre&s;s notice of the claims of tho&s;e &s;tates, but made no objection to them, al|ledged no right in it&s;elf. This di&s;pute was after|wards &s;ettled, and South-Carolina ceded her claims to Georgia. The act of ce&s;&s;ion was com|municated to congre&s;s; and congre&s;s made no ob|jection<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See act p. 23.</NOTE>; &s;o far indeed was &s;he from objecting that on the 20th of October, 1787, after this ce&s;&s;ion had been communicated to her, &s;he made a public, and formal requi&s;ition, on the &s;tate of Georgia; for a ce&s;&s;ion of her territory<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ibid, p. 24.&mdash;See al&s;o the Pre&s;ident's proclamation again&s;t James, v. Fallon, in 1790.</NOTE>. This act, done under a complete knowledge of all the circum&s;tan|ces, was a very &s;trong recognition of the right of that &s;tate.</P>
<P>In 1789, Georgia, pa&s;&s;ed an act for the &s;ale of the&s;e lands to certain companies; one of the com|panies attempted a &s;ettlement and &s;ent an agent; all this was known to the government of the Unit|ed States, which i&s;&s;ued a proclamation again&s;t cer|tain acts of the agent, but &s;aid not a word again&s;t the &s;ale, or about any right of the United States, to the land<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Jour. of Congre&s;s, vol, 12. p. 21. &mdash;And appendix No. 15. the re&s;olution it&s;elf.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Two years after this the government of the U|nited States, being engaged in a di&s;pute with Spain about this country, expre&s;sly declared, in an of|ficial repre&s;entation, that it belonged to Georgia by virtue of her charters, and the proclamation of 1763, and re&s;ted their claim to it as part of their territories, intirely on her title.</P>
<P>What higher &s;anction to a title could an indivi|dual, or a government hold out? What &s;tronger acknowledgment than this long acquie&s;cence, fol|lowed by this expre&s;s declaration, when the &s;ubject
<PB N="41" REF="035588_0044_1005F7A69ADC8A88">
<GAP DESC="duplicate" EXTENT="1 page">
<PB N="42" REF="035588_0045_1005F7A90142A1C0">had been &s;o often di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, the claim &s;o often re|newed? The government not only &s;uffer Geor|gia repeatedly to &s;ay, "This is my land," with|out contradicting her; to &s;ell it once without in|terpo&s;ing; but, not content with this tacit acqui|e&s;cence, joins in the a&s;&s;ertion, and lays in a &s;o|lemn act, "This is the land of Georgia." The que&s;tion may be repeated, what &s;tronger encou|ragement can be given to purcha&s;ers?</P>
<P>Even after the la&s;t &s;ale had been made, of which the government was formally notified by the go|vernor of Georgia, no &s;ufficient &s;teps were taken to warn the purcha&s;ers of their danger, and pre|vent them from completing the payment. When the government received this notice only, fifty thou&s;and dollars out of five hundred thou&s;and had been paid. The re&s;t was not due till &s;ome months af|ter. Even then the government &s;et up no claim, made no interference. It merely held up the idea that it might po&s;&s;ibly po&s;&s;e&s;s a right, by directing its law officers to in&s;titute an enquiry into the title of Georgia. Even this idea they did not plainly intimate, much le&s;s expre&s;sly declare. Their re|&s;olution directs the Attorney general, "To col|lect, dige&s;t, and report, <HI>to the next congre&s;s,</HI> the charters treaties, and other documents, relative to, and explanatory, of the title to the lands &s;ituate in the &s;outhwe&s;tern parts of the United States, and claimed by certain companies under a law of the &s;tate of Georgia." How was it to be under&s;tood from this proceeding that the government claimed the land! with what ju&s;tice could purcha&s;ers, who contracted under the &s;trong previous a&s;&s;urances, which have been &s;tated and after this la&s;t tran&s;action paid their money, be called upon for the purcha&s;|ed property, by that very party which had thus led them into the contract?</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="035588_0046_1005F7AA927BEF00">
But was the government apprized of their right? Was it unknown to the purcha&s;ers them|&s;elves? The&s;e two que&s;tions de&s;erve to be con&s;i|dered.</P>
<P>As to the fir&s;t, it is to be ob&s;erved that every per&s;on is pre&s;umed in law to be acquainted with his own rights. This principle is founded on the be&s;t rea&s;ons. If a per&s;on, having a right to land, &s;hould &s;tand &s;ilently by, and &s;ee it &s;old, and then be permited to reclaim it under pretence, that he was ignorant of his title, a pretence which it would frequently be impo&s;&s;ible to di&s;prove, the greate&s;t frauds might be committed. It would therefore be pre&s;umed by the courts that he knew his own title, unle&s;s he gave very good proof to the con|trary, and he would be bound by the &s;ale. Mo&s;t of the deci&s;ions indeed have been in ca&s;es where the party was expre&s;sly &s;tated to have been acquaint|ed with his own title; but there are &s;ome where this does not appear; and in one<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Hud&s;den, v. Cheney, 2. Vern. 150.</NOTE>, the owner, who was a woman, declared on oath that &s;he was ignorant of her right: yet as &s;he was pre&s;ent at the &s;ale, and did not object, &s;he was decreed to be bound. This mu&s;t have been on the prin|ciple that every one is pre&s;umed to under&s;tand his own rights.</P>
<P>This principle however, could apply only in ca&s;es where the party had a rea&s;onable opportuni|ty of knowing them; for if he were in circum|&s;tances which rendered that knowledge impo&s;&s;ible he could not, on any principle of ju&s;tice, be con|&s;idered as having con&s;ented to their alienation. In the abovementioned ca&s;e the woman, tho' ig|norant of her title, was in a &s;ituation which ena|bled
<PB N="44" REF="035588_0047_1005F7AD0DC567E8">her to become acquainted with it by proper attention and enquiry<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See al&s;o the ca&s;e of Hobbs, v. Norton, 1. Equi. la. Abr. 356.</NOTE>. And the United States al&s;o might ea&s;ily have acquired the mo&s;t complete knowledge of their claim to the land in que&s;tion.</P>
<P>In ca&s;es moreover, of mere &s;ilent acquie&s;cence, a party might perhaps be allowed to di&s;prove his own knowledge. Even this would be very doubt|ful. But where he had given po&s;itive and expre&s;s confirmation to the right of the &s;eller, and had thus encouraged the purcha&s;er to buy, he could never be allowed to claim the property in contra|diction to his own declarations. Silence about his right might be occa&s;ioned, and therefore, perhaps, excu&s;ed, by ignorance of it; but that ignorance could never be a &s;ufficient inducement, or a ju&s;ti|fication, for his declaring the right to be in ano|ther. If he cho&s;e ignorantly to make &s;uch a de|claration, he him&s;elf, not the innocent purcha&s;er, mu&s;t abide the con&s;equence<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See the above acted ca&s;e of Hobbs, v. Norton.</NOTE>. In this predica|ment is the government of the United States; which not content with &s;ilently acquie&s;cing in the acts of Georgia, has made the &s;tronge&s;t declara|tions in favour of her right.</P>
<P>And la&s;tly there is good rea&s;on to believe that the government was actually apprized of its right to this land. The exten&s;ion of Florida, took place in 1770. In 1777 the Indian claims in the Na|tehez di&s;trict, which lies within the limits of this exten&s;ion, were extingui&s;hed by the Briti&s;h govern|ment. At the treaty held at Hopewell, in 1786, between the United States and the Chacktaws, the former, in order to preclude the Indians from the Natehez di&s;trict, availed them&s;elves of this extin|gui&s;hment:
<PB N="45" REF="035588_0048_1005F7B065112E78">and as for obvious rea&s;ons, they could not have &s;uppo&s;ed it to have been made for the benefit of any other government than Florida, Georgia having then declared it&s;elf independent, it was notice to them that the Briti&s;h had extended the juri&s;diction of that province. Their claim is founded on this exten&s;ion; of which if they did not in this manner receive complete notice, they had &s;uch intimation at lea&s;t, as not only made it incumbent on them to enquire fully into the bu&s;i|ne&s;s<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the ca&s;e of Hoobs, and Norton.</NOTE>, but pointed out the &s;ource from whence all nece&s;&s;ary information might be drawn.</P>
<P>But it may be a&s;ked, if the government was apprized of the&s;e circum&s;tances, why did it omit to urge them in its negociations with Spain? The rea&s;on is obvious. To have urged them would have defeated its own claim. It could claim this country as part of the United States, on the ground only that it was not a part of Flo|rida. To have &s;hewn that it had become a part of that province before the treaty of peace, would have e&s;tabli&s;hed the claim of Spain; for Florida was ceded to her previou&s;ly to the defini|tive treaty between Great-Britain, and us; and it is on the definitive treaty that our claim re&s;ted. It was the bu&s;ine&s;s of our government therefore to keep this matter out of view; and fortunately for us, it &s;eems to have been unknown to the Spani|ards. Certainly it was much wi&s;er to retain this country, as part of the United States, even at the expence of giving it to Georgia, than to yield it to Spain. If our government cho&s;e to pur&s;ue that cour&s;e, and by its conduct and a&s;&s;ertions individu|als have been induced, confiding in its authority, to regard Georgia as the owner of the&s;e lands and to purcha&s;e from her, with what ju&s;tice could the United States now attempt to deprive them of the
<PB N="46" REF="035588_0049_1005F7B2D36A4E70">property? Is government, contrary to every rule of law, to take advantage of its own acts in order to injure others, and to puni&s;h them for having con|fided in its &s;olemn declarations?</P>
<P>But were not the purcha&s;ers them&s;elves acquaint|ed with this right, or at lea&s;t bound to take notice of it? And in that ca&s;e did they not purcha&s;e at their own ri&s;k? The an&s;wer to this al&s;o is obvious. Had the United States been acquie&s;cent, had they remained &s;ilent and pa&s;&s;ive only, the purcha&s;ers might have been con&s;idered, perhaps, as taking at their own ri&s;k: but when Georgia openly claimed and exerci&s;ed the right, and the United States not only made no objection but aided the claim by their po&s;itive declarations, the purcha&s;ers were bound to look no further. Even had the claim of the government been matter of record<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the ca&s;e of Arnot v. Bi&s;coe, 1. Veg. 96.</NOTE>, or had they been expre&s;sly informed of its exi&s;|tence<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ca&s;e of Hobbs, v. Norton ante.</NOTE>, yet would their purcha&s;e have been valid under the&s;e circum&s;tances of encouragement, by the government it&s;elf.</P>
<P>It &s;eems clear therefore, that as the party &s;elling not only claimed the right, but had the appear|ance of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing it, which appearance was con|firmed by the acquie&s;cence, and even the expre&s;s declaration of the true owners, this &s;ale, in the ca&s;e of an individual, would be completely valid and binding in law.</P>
<P>But will the &s;ame rules apply to a government? This is the point next to be examined.</P>
<P>In the Engli&s;h law, from which mo&s;t of our maxims of juri&s;prudence are derived, it is a re|ceived principle that the king who repre&s;ents the government, and in whom the public property is legally ve&s;ted, can be made ameanable to no kind of proce&s;s; that to him no fraud, no improprie|ty,
<PB N="47" REF="035588_0050_1005F7B461BB7B98">no negligence even, can be imputed. Yet if he &s;hould do a wrongful act, as making an im|proper grant, for in&s;tance, the court of Chancery would give redre&s;s to the party injured, and even &s;et a&s;ide the grant, if nece&s;&s;ary, on the ground that the king had been deceived. This proves two things; fir&s;t that the acts of government are &s;ubject to the rules of law and ju&s;tice, although the go|vernment it&s;elf cannot be brought to an&s;wer in a Legal proce&s;s: And &s;econdly, that the inability of the government to do wrong is a mere fiction, which the judicial power explains a way in favour of ju&s;tice, whenever it can. They will not &s;ay that the act was done thro' negligence or an improper intention, but through deception; yet if in fact wrongful, they will &s;et it a&s;ide, whenever it is of &s;uch a nature as to be &s;ubjected to their controul.</P>
<P>This being the ca&s;e even in England, who&s;e monarchieal government is &s;uppo&s;ed to require a &s;acred inviolability in the chief Magi&s;trate, the &s;ame maxims &s;hould obtain more readily and in greater extent among us, as being far more con|genial to the nature and principles of our govern|ment. Accordingly we find that the idea of &s;ub|jecting the acts of government to the rules of ju|dicial dici&s;ion is perfectly familiar in our con&s;ti|tutions. Our courts make no difficulty of declar|ing Ligi&s;lative acts void, even tho&s;e of the Union, where they are contrary to the Con&s;titution. This is founded on the principle that the ligi&s;latures in making &s;uch acts, have exceeded their autho|rity. Why &s;hould not the acts of government in other in&s;tances al&s;o, be &s;ubjected to the rules of law and the maxims of ju&s;tice? Why &s;hould not this &s;alutary controul of the judicial power, be ex|tended to all ca&s;es where the acts complained of
<PB N="48" REF="035588_0051_1005F7B7E1F54878">can be brought within its reach? There &s;eems to exi&s;t, be good rea&s;on to the contrary. Our go|vernment po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es land which it is in the practice of &s;elling to individuals; and it appoints agents for that purpo&s;e, with proper powers and in&s;truc|tions. If after one of the&s;e agents had made a &s;ale per&s;uant to his powers, the government &s;hould attempt to reclaim the land or &s;ell it again, would not the judicial power protect the title of the fir&s;t purcha&s;er? Would it not enquire into the validity of the &s;econd &s;ale whenever it became the &s;ubject of litigation, and declare it void, even if made by an expre&s;s law? There &s;eems no doubt on this head. If then the judicial power would enforce the rules of law and ju&s;tice as to one mode of di&s;po&s;ing of property by the govern|ment, why &s;hould it not equally enforce them as to other modes? And we know that a per&s;on may as effectually di&s;po&s;e of his Land by &s;tanding by, while another &s;ells it, as by &s;elling it him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, there does not &s;eem to be any rea&s;on why the &s;ame rules which have been e&s;ta|bli&s;hed on this &s;ubject re&s;pecting individuals &s;hould not equally apply to the acts of government. From whence it would re&s;ult that the United States, having not only acquie&s;ced in all the acts of owner&s;hip exerci&s;ed by the State of Georgia over this Land, and in the ultimate &s;ale of it, but al&s;o &s;upported and given colour to the right of that State by expre&s;s declarations in its favour, will be bound by the &s;ale. This opinion however cannot be po&s;itively pronounced. The matter is attended by many difficulties; and the dici&s;ion, in &s;ome of its mo&s;t important parts, re&s;ts not on authority, but on rea&s;onings, the force of which mu&s;t be judged of in the courts. There perhaps a very different view of the &s;ubject may may be entertained.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="035588_0052_1005F7BA8CDA63D8">
The claims of the United States, which opened the fir&s;t, and far the mo&s;t exten&s;ive field of enqui|ry, having been thus &s;urveyed, the repealing act of Georgia now pre&s;ents it&s;elf for con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>This act it is to be ob&s;erved in the fir&s;t place does not profe&s;s to <HI>repeal</HI> the act of January 7th 1795, but declares it void. The rea&s;ons for this mode of proceeding are obvious. The act of January 7th had produced its whole effect. The &s;ales which it directed had been completely made, the money paid, and grants pa&s;&s;ed. It could not therefore have been at all affected by a repeal: for it is a well known principle that to repeal a law, far from undoing what has already been done under it, can only prevent its future operation. In or|der to de&s;troy the&s;e &s;ales therefore&mdash;which was the object aimed at by the legi&s;lature&mdash;it was ne|ce&s;&s;ary to do &s;omething more than repeal the law it was nece&s;&s;ary to declare it originally void.</P>
<P>A &s;ingle ob&s;ervation, which pre&s;ents it&s;elf here, might decide the que&s;tion on this repealing law It is this; that the force, validity or meaning of a legi&s;lative act is purely a judicial que&s;tion, and altogether beyond the province of the legi&s;lature It is the province of the legi&s;lative power to make laws, to give them their exi&s;tence; but to ex|pound and enforce them belongs to the judiciary. The judicial power is to declare what the law <HI>is;</HI> the legi&s;lative, what it <HI>&s;hall be.</HI> The legi&s;lature therefore may repeal one of its own acts; that is, may declare that it &s;hall not hereafter be law: but &s;hould it go further, and declare that it is void, that it is not now law, it &s;teps beyond its powers; and its proceedings become null.</P>
<P>This is a fundamental principle of all our con&s;ti|tutions, which declare that the judicial and legi&s;la|tive powers &s;hall be di&s;tinct and &s;eparate. It re&s;ults
<PB N="50" REF="035588_0053_1005F7BC1BF8FAF0">al&s;o from the very exi&s;tence of a written con&s;titu|tion; which, by its nece&s;&s;ary operation, pre&s;cribes limits to the legi&s;lative body, and confides the pro|tection and maintainance of tho&s;e limits to the ju|dicial power. As well might the legi&s;lature try cau&s;es, or hear appeals, as attempt to expound, enforce, or declare void one of its own acts; ex|cept &s;o far as might relate to the <HI>future</HI> operation of &s;uch act. Its validity, &s;o far as might relate to its former operation, to acts already done under its authority, is a que&s;tion which the courts of ju&s;|tice alone not the legi&s;lature are competent to decide.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;ales moreover were contracts, made with the utmo&s;t &s;olemnity, for a valuable con&s;ideration, and carried deliberately into complete execution. It is an invariable maxim of law and of natural ju&s;tice, that one of the parties to a contract can|not by his own act, exempt him&s;elf, from its obli|gation. A contrary principle would break down all the ramparts of right, di&s;olve the bonds of pro|perty, and render good faith, to enforce the ob&s;erv|ance of which is the great object of civil in&s;titu|tions, &s;ub&s;ervient to the partiality, the &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, and the unju&s;t caprices of every individual. There is no rea&s;on why governments, more than private per&s;ons, &s;hould be exempt from the opera|tion of this mixim; nor are they con&s;idered as ex|empt by our con&s;titution or our laws. The &s;tate of Georgia, being a party to this contract, could no more relieve it&s;elf from the obligation, by any act of its own, than an individual who had &s;igned a bond could relieve him&s;elf from the nece&s;&s;ity of pay|ment there were &s;ufficient grounds for relief in either ca&s;e, the &s;tate or the individual mu&s;t re&s;ort to the courts of ju&s;tice, where it would be afforded: but the acts of the one and the other for relieving them&s;elves would be equally and e&s;&s;entially negatory.</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="035588_0054_1005F7BE9EC895B0">
The act of Georgia therefore can have no legal effect.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Is &s;atisfactory to find this opinion corroborated by that of a very emi|nent Lawer in Newyork who was &s;ometime ago con&s;ulted on this point&mdash; See Col Hamilton's opinion; apendix No 17.</NOTE> It can be regarded only as a declara|tion &s;tating the grounds on which that &s;tate con|ceives it&s;elf intitled to relief from the contract in que&s;tion. As &s;uch a declaration however, from &s;o re&s;pectable a body as the legi&s;lature of a &s;tate, cannot fail to make a &s;trong impre&s;&s;ion, it will be not improper to examine the&s;e grounds a little more minutely, in order that a better judgment may be formed about their &s;ufficiency.</P>
<P>The &s;ales are declared void by this act, on two grounds. Fir&s;t that the legi&s;lature had not con|&s;titutional power to make them. Secondly that in pa&s;&s;ing the act for that purpo&s;e, it was influen|ced by fraudulent and corrupt motives.</P>
<P>As to the fir&s;t, it is not improper to repeat that it is purely an object of judicial enquiry. Had the &s;tate of Georgia, as it might have done, filed a bill in the &s;upreme federal court again&s;t the purcha&s;ers, to &s;et a&s;ide the &s;ales, one object of enquiry in that court would have been whether they they were made by &s;ufficient authority: and if it had found that they were not, they mu&s;t have been &s;et a&s;ide. But who ever heard till this act was pa&s;&s;ed, that the legi&s;latures under our con&s;ti|tutions have not power to &s;ell the public proper|ty, or give it away? This has always been con&s;i|dered as one of the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential branches of le|gi&s;lative authority. It has been exerci&s;ed by every legi&s;lature in the Union; and by that of Georgia, in numerous in&s;tances. If the legi&s;lature has a right to di&s;po&s;e of the public lands, which cannot be deni|ed, it may di&s;po&s;e of them in what quantities and
<PB N="52" REF="035588_0055_1005F7C04A7E7A48">on what conditions it thinks fit: for the right be|ing unre&s;tricted, &s;o mu&s;t be its exerci&s;e.</P>
<P>The &s;econd ground, the ground of fraud and corruption, was equally a &s;ubject of judicial inqui|ry. There cannot be a doubt that if a legi&s;lative body in making a contract, has been impo&s;ed on, it will, equally with an individual, be intitled to relief; but, like an individual, it mu&s;t &s;eek this relief in a court of ju&s;tice. In a bill filed in this ca&s;e for &s;etting a&s;ide the &s;ales, the allegation of fraud would have been enquired into, and, if &s;up|ported by proper proof, would no doubt have been a &s;ufficient ground for relief. This cour&s;e the &s;tate might have pur&s;ued. In this manner it might have obtained whatever remedy it is inti|tled to in law and ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>But what is the nature of the fraud complained of; and by what proof is the charge &s;upported?</P>
<P>The act does not pretend that the legi&s;lature which made the&s;e &s;ales was deceived, was impo&s;ed on; but that &s;ome individuals among them were corrupted. Do the circum&s;tances alledged a|mount to corruption? Can the motives of indivi|dual members be enquired into, in order to inva|lidate the acts of a legi&s;lative body?</P>
<P>It is alledged by the act "That a majority of tho&s;e members of the legi&s;lature who voted in favour of the &s;ales, were engaged in the purcha&s;e." There are various other vague and general charges, but this is the only &s;pecific fact alledged. It is not even pretended that a majority of the legi&s;lature was concerned, but only "A majority of tho&s;e who voted for the &s;ales." Admitting this to be true, was it an act of corruption? It might be con|&s;idered perhaps as an impropriety; but on what ground can it be &s;tigmatized as corrupt? It is not &s;tated that tho&s;e per&s;ons were bribed; that
<PB N="53" REF="035588_0056_1005F7C3C87B10F8">they were to receive money for their votes, or even to have part of the land without paying for it; but &s;imply that they were concerned in the purcha&s;e. But are there no other than corrupt motives which could induce a member to vote for a &s;ale of public property, in which he him&s;elf was concerned? Might he not regard the &s;ale, e&s;pe|cially as it was of lands, the benefit of which to the public depends on their being cultivated, as advantageous to the &s;tate as well as to the purcha|&s;ers? Might it not in fact be &s;o? It is a rule of law that if an act can be fairly accounted for on proper motives, corrupt ones &s;hall not be pre&s;umed.</P>
<P>But it is believed that a legi&s;lative act can never be invalidated on account of the motives from which it may have been agreed to by individual members: that tho&s;e motives can never be brought into que&s;tion. Could &s;uch enquiries be in&s;tituted where could be the end of them? By what mode of proof &s;hould they be conducted? What a door would be opened to fraud and uncertainty of every kind! The very foundations of legi&s;lative authori|ty would be &s;haken; and all its acts might be nul|lified by the fraud or the artifices of individuals. If the legi&s;lature, con&s;idered as an individual, have been impo&s;ed on, like an individual it may be re|lieved: if it have exceeded the bounds of its au|thority, its acts are null; but the motives of its members can never be que&s;tioned without &s;triking at the root of law, and introducing &s;cenes of con|fu&s;ion a thou&s;and times more intolerable, then any evils which it could intended to remedy.</P>
<P>The proofs of this corruption, which come next to be con&s;idered, are &s;tated by the act under four heads: affidavits; pre&s;entments of grand juries; petitions and remon&s;trances; and the circum&s;tance
<PB N="54" REF="035588_0057_1005F7C71112D980">of a larger &s;um having been rejected for the &s;ame property.</P>
<P>It is well known that the pre&s;entments of a grand jury are never admitted as evidence in courts of ju&s;tice. Even the te&s;timony on which they are founded is, for the mo&s;t part, of &s;uch a nature that it could not be received there. They &s;erve as the foundations of enquiry, but never as proof of a fact. Such of the pre&s;entments in que&s;tion as have been &s;een, even if they were admitted as evi|dence, would prove nothing; for they either de|nounce the &s;ales in general terms, as injurious to the public and improperly obtained, or merely &s;tate the fact of &s;ome members having been con|cerned, or reque&s;ted to be &s;o, in the purcha&s;e.</P>
<P>Still le&s;s can remon&s;trances and petitions be re|lied on in the deci&s;ion of legal rights. The means by which they are frequently obtained, and the &s;light grounds whereon they &s;ometimes re&s;t, are too well known to need any ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P>As to the rejection of a larger offer, it may have been a very wi&s;e &s;tep. The &s;ecurity may have been deemed in&s;ufficient. The offer may have been con&s;idered as delu&s;ive. It is not known by the coun&s;el much le&s;s in&s;inuated, that this was the ca&s;e; but it is &s;ufficient that it may have been &s;o con&s;idered by the legi&s;lature, and therefore may have furni&s;hed them with a very upright tho' perhaps ill-judged motive, for their rejection. The fact is that the offer was made by only four or five individuals; while the companies who purcha&s;ed con&s;i&s;ted of a very con&s;iderable num|ber. The latter al&s;o paid a large &s;um in advance, which it is not under&s;tood that the former propo&s;ed. Under the&s;e circum&s;tances, &s;urely it is not nece&s;&s;a|ry to re&s;ort to corrupt motives for the preference.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="035588_0058_1005F7C89D633180">
On the &s;ubject of the affidavits, all of which have been carefully examined, &s;everal important ob&s;ervations occur.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place they were ex parte; taken in private, before a committee of the hou&s;e of repre|&s;entatives; the witne&s;&s;es not confronted with tho&s;e per&s;ons again&s;t whom their te&s;timony was to ope|rate; not &s;ubjected to cro&s;s-examination. The admi&s;&s;ion of te&s;timony taken in this manner is no le&s;s contradictory to the practice of every court known to the American con&s;titutions, than to the plain principles of natural ju&s;tice. Had tho&s;e wit|ne&s;&s;es been cro&s;s-examined, it is impo&s;&s;ible to tell what circum&s;tances might have appeared to give a different complexion to the whole ca&s;e. In te&s;ti|mony too not delivered from the mouth of the witne&s;s him&s;elf, but taken in writing and taken by one &s;ide only, it is natural to pre&s;ume that what|ever makes in favour of that &s;ide will be more par|ticularly dwelt on, and more &s;trongly expre&s;&s;ed; while &s;uch parts as &s;eem oppo&s;ed to it are apt to be either omitted or &s;tated imperfectly. This ari&s;es from the natural imperfection of the human mind, from the effect of our pa&s;&s;ions on our under&s;tand|ing and our conduct. Hence has re&s;ulted a rule which is invariably ob&s;erved in all our courts; that te&s;timony is never admitted, unle&s;s both par|ties have had an opportunity of joining in the ex|amination.</P>
<P>In the ca&s;e of the&s;e affidavits it is affirmed that the examining committee refu&s;ed to take down material parts of the te&s;timony actually given by the witne&s;&s;es, and tending to exculpate the mem|bers accu&s;ed of corruption.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Affidavits of Flourney v. Clayton.</NOTE> In the uncertainty that there is, whether this fact may not have been
<PB N="56" REF="035588_0059_1005F7CB1C810AF8">mi&s;under&s;tood, the re&s;pect due to &s;uch a body as the committee of a legi&s;lative a&s;&s;embly repre&s;&s;es tho&s;e remarks to which, of true, it mu&s;t give ri&s;e.</P>
<P>But the evidence it&s;elf, if properly taken, is li|able to many &s;trong objections.</P>
<P>In &s;ome in&s;tances it is contradictory<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Affidavits of James Tyroll, and Ru&s;&s;el Jones.</NOTE> and con|jectural<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">De. and Philip Clayton and John Thomas.</NOTE>? It depends in a great degree on hear|&s;ay<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Affidavids throughout</NOTE>, which the be&s;t known rules of law, and the dictates of common ju&s;tice, concur in rejecting. It con&s;i&s;ts almo&s;t wholly of the confe&s;&s;ions of members made, not to the legi&s;lature or the com|mittee, but to the witne&s;&s;es, about the impropriety of their own conduct; and finally the whole &s;cope of it is to prove that certain members, who voted for the law, were actuated by corrupt motives; a point which it has been &s;hewn, can never be en|quired into for the purpo&s;e of invalidating a le|gi&s;lative act.</P>
<P>It is worthy of remark al&s;o that the members who appear by the&s;e affidavits to have been con|cerned in the contract, were to pay their portion of the purcha&s;e money.<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">See affidavits of van Allen, Rains, and Lucas.</NOTE> There is indeed one in|&s;tance of the contrary; but it is proved by the hear&s;ay confe&s;&s;ion, not of the member him&s;elf, but of a per&s;on who declared him&s;elf to be one of the purcha&s;ers<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Do. of James M. Niel.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>This te&s;timony therefore, whether its &s;ub&s;tance be regarded or the manner of its being taken, ap|pears equally defective.</P>
<P>But if it were le&s;s &s;o, if the proofs of corrup|tion in the legi&s;lature were not only admi&s;&s;ible but &s;trong, they would be greatly counter balanced by the conduct of the governor. He has never
<PB N="57" REF="035588_0060_1005F7CE816573D0">been accu&s;ed, or even &s;u&s;pected, of corruption. It can hardly be conceived, that, pure him&s;elf, he would have aided the corruption of others; would have &s;anctioned an act which he knew to have originated in motives &s;o flagitious. Had the&s;e practices exi&s;ted, it is next to impo&s;&s;ible that they &s;hould have e&s;caped his knowledge; for he was not only on the &s;pot, and well acquainted with all the actors in this bu&s;ine&s;s, but lived in the clo&s;e&s;t connection and intimacy with &s;ome of its warme&s;t oppo&s;ers<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A Leading member of the Senate, who was the governor's &s;on-in-law and lived in his hou&s;e was one of the mo&s;t &s;trenuous in oppo&s;ition.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>It cannot be pretended that the governor coun|tenanced this act through deference of the Legi&s;|lature; for the &s;ame motive would have led him to concur in the fir&s;t bill which however was rejected. He mu&s;t therefore have a&s;&s;ented to the &s;econd, be|cau&s;e he found it free from tho&s;e objections which had operated again&s;t the fir&s;t; and con&s;idered it as conducive to the public good. Why may not the legi&s;lature be concieved to have acted from the &s;ame motives? Mu&s;t corruption be re&s;orted to in order to find a rea&s;on for their doing an act, which the governor, equally enlightened with them, was led to by a &s;en&s;e of duty?</P>
<P>Thus it &s;eems clear that the legi&s;lature of Geor|gia was wholly incompetent to &s;et a&s;ide this act, even had there been &s;ufficient grounds; becau&s;e this is a judicial, not a legi&s;lative function, and becau&s;e the &s;ale was a contract to which the &s;tate it&s;elf was a party: that had the legi&s;lature been competent, the evidence on which it proceeded was not only inconclu&s;ive, but altogether inadmi&s;&s;ible: And that, &s;ince to di&s;po&s;e of the public land is one of the mo&s;t undeniable powers of the legi&s;lature, and
<PB N="58" REF="035588_0061_1005F7D11992D060">the motives of members, even if corrupt, which in this ca&s;e is far from being e&s;tabli&s;hed, cannot be alledged again&s;t the validity of a legi&s;lative act, there was no ground, either of uncon&s;titu|tionality or corruption, upon which, even in a competent tribunal, this act could have been de|clared void.</P>
<P>It is proper to add that even if this contract could be &s;et a&s;ide, an essential condition of doing &s;o mu&s;t be the repayment of the purcha&s;e money. It is one of the mo&s;t obvious improprieties in the re|pealing act, that it attempts to de&s;troy the purcha&s;e without making the lea&s;t provi&s;ion, or even &s;tipu|lation, for their repayment<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See note page 31.</NOTE>. If, as it has been a&s;&s;erted, the legi&s;lature which pa&s;&s;ed the repealing act made an appropriation of part of this money, it was a complete confirmation, as far as depend|ed on them, of the contract which they avowed an intention of annulling<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See the ca&s;e of Cole v. Gibbons. P. W.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>From this view of the two points &s;ubmitted, taken under all tho&s;e a&s;pects which were declared important, the under&s;igned coun&s;el is led to the following conclu&s;ion, which he certifies as his opi|nion: 1. That the United States never had a right to any part of the lands in que&s;tion, above a line drawn due ea&s;t from the mouth of the Ya|zoo: 2. That, under circum&s;tances of the ca&s;e, they will probably be con&s;idered, in the courts of equity, as bound by the &s;ales which have been made by the &s;tate of Georgia below that line: And 3. That the title of the purcha&s;ers, either above or below, can in no degree be affected by the repealing act of that State.</P>

<HEAD><HI>No. XIII. AUGUSTA, January 28.</HI> To the Pre&s;ident and Fellow-Citizens of the Senate.</HEAD>
<P>The Senate and hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives are now con|&s;titutionally convened for legi&s;lative deliberations, and at
<PB N="92" REF="035588_0095_1005F822A61BF370">a time too when the minds of our fellow-Citizens are, and have been for &s;ome time pa&s;t more engaged in di&s;cu&s;&s;ing the conduct of the la&s;t legi&s;lature on the &s;ubject of the act for di&s;po&s;ing of part of our We&s;tern Territory to certain companies, than perhaps has ever been experienced &s;ince this State a&s;&s;umed rank with her &s;i&s;ter States&mdash;it will, no doubt be among&s;t the mo&s;t important matters that may engro&s;s your attention to enquire on what ground this act was founded, and if a con&s;titutional and legal remedy can applied to calm the minds of our fellow citizens on this intere&s;ting &s;ubject: in my opinion it requires and I flat|ter my&s;elf will receive your mo&s;t &s;erious delibiration, whe|ther a law can be con&s;titutionally made to repeal another that has been fully carried into effect, as the one now in que&s;tion, the companies having paid into the trea&s;ury the whole of the purcha&s;e money, and cancelled their mort|gages; and whether, if repealed the remedy may not be even wor&s;e than the di&s;ea&s;e. But if a law can be devi&s;ed that will con&s;titutionally repeal the one referred to, and guard again&s;t future murmurs and well grounded com|plaints again&s;t the repeal, I have no doubt but the man you may honour with the appointment of the chief Magi&s;trate, will readily deem it a duty cheerfully to coperate.</P>
<P>It is a matter much to be regretted (con&s;idering the un|favourable light the act for di&s;po&s;ing of our We&s;tern Ter|ritory has been viewed in) that the &s;pirit of party re&s;ent|ment and per&s;onal reflections &s;hould have ran &s;o high in many in&s;tances; the public mind has been inflamed by un|fair repre&s;entations, and our new&s;papers have teemed with per&s;onal abu&s;e and invective&mdash;this I remark from having experienced the public &s;lander; endeavours have been made to calumniate my character by fal&s;e reports, &s;uch as that the motives which induced me to give my a&s;&s;ent to the &s;econd act, proceeded from private intere&s;t, regardle&s;s of the &s;acred duty I owed to the &s;tation I filled, and the rights, and intere&s;ts, of my fellow-citizens&mdash;con&s;cious of the purity of my intentions, and &s;upported by the Ju&s;tice and integrity of my actions, I have treated with &s;ilent contempt tho&s;e ba&s;e and malicious reports, and I now defy the blacke&s;t and the mo&s;t per&s;evering malice aided by di&s;appointed avarice, to produce one &s;ingle evidence of my ever having been intere&s;ted in the &s;ale to the a|mount of one &s;ingle farthing: but whil&s;t I treated with
<PB N="93" REF="035588_0096_1005F8246ECC6860">neglect tho&s;e reports &s;o injurious to my character I feel it a re&s;pect due to you and a duty I owe to my reputa|tion to give you a candid and fair &s;tatement of the mo|tives which actuated me on a &s;ubject which has &s;o much di&s;turbed the citizens of Georgia. On the 25th day of De|cember, 1794, an act for di&s;po&s;ing of part of our We&s;t|ern Territory to four companies, was pre&s;ented to me for my concurrence; after the mo&s;t mature reflection my judgment was capable of, I thought it my duty to refu&s;e my a&s;&s;ent, and a&s;&s;igned my rea&s;ons, which I flattered my|&s;elf would have po&s;tponed any further legi&s;lative proceed|ings in the law, until the next meeting of the hou&s;e: but in that I was mi&s;taken. The fir&s;t idea that occurred to &s;ome of the members when the bill was returned with re|marks, was that I &s;hould be impeached for an uncon&s;titution|al act&mdash;yet the more cool reflection of the hou&s;e terminated in appointing a committee to confer with me on my ob|jections and to know if it was in the power of the legi&s;|lature to frame a bill for the &s;ale of the land which would meet my concurrence. On the conference I was led to believe that the committee was convinced, my rea&s;ons for rejecting the law did not proceed from "Executive ar|rogance, or from a wi&s;h to bring into action a power heretofore dormant in our proceedings, or from a propen|&s;ity in me to do an act of &s;o great re&s;pon&s;ibility; but from a conviction that it would tend to the real intere&s;t of the State&mdash;the reflecting mind will ea&s;ily perceive how much the re&s;pon&s;ibility would be enhanced by rejecting a bill that the legi&s;lature might pa&s;s for the &s;ale of the lands; after being in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of my remarks, even &s;up|po&s;ing it to be &s;imilar to the fir&s;t: but when it appears that three of the mo&s;t important objections I had made to the fir&s;t law were removed, I think there is no man of cool di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate reflection that would have refu&s;ed his a&s;&s;ent to it for any rea&s;ons &s;hort of a clear proof of corruption in its pa&s;&s;age through the legi&s;lature, <HI>and no &s;uch infor|mation ever came to my knowledge.</HI></P>
<P>After all the popular clamour the law has occa&s;ioned, I &s;hould depart from my u&s;ual candour to &s;ay I have e|ver blamed my&s;elf either for an error of the head or a corruption of the heart, and on a &s;imilar occa&s;ion &s;hould feel my&s;elf perfectly ju&s;tified in pur&s;uing a &s;imilar con|duct: Much has been &s;aid about una&s;certained millions
<PB N="94" REF="035588_0097_1005F82884B9CEF0">of acres being &s;old and that more than fifty millions of a|cres are di&s;po&s;ed to the companies by that act: after having thought it my duty to act on the &s;econd bill. I ordered the Surveyor General to furni&s;h me with as accurate a map of the country contemplated to be &s;old, as any documents he had or could procure would afford&mdash;this was done, and is now on the file of the Executive, from which it will ap|pear there was no more than twenty-nine million 400,000 acres in the whole agregate the fir&s;t law had in view, and one fourth of that quantity is now re&s;erved to the State and &s;ubject to her di&s;po&s;ition. This is a true &s;tate of facts, &s;o far as they have come to my knowledge, and if it may afford you any u&s;eful hints in your deliberations, it will give me plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>The &s;um of 500,000 dollars has been paid into your Trea&s;ury in terms of the act, 50,000 of which has been realized in &s;ix per cent &s;tock of the United States, the in|tere&s;t ari&s;ing therefrom &s;ince the purcha&s;e, amounting to 2201 dollars 29 cents has been paid into your Trea&s;ury as al&s;o the intere&s;t ari&s;ing from the ballance due to this State on the final &s;ettlement with the United States, a|mounting to 689 dollars 58 cents, and the Trea&s;urer's re|ceipts for the original certificates, &s;tanding on the books of the loan office of the United States, are filed in the office of the cheque or the Trea&s;ury&mdash;the &s;um of 30,000 dol|lars &s;tand appropriated for extingui&s;hing the Indian claims to the land between the Oconee and Oakmulgee rivers, and 20,000 dollars have been applied to paying the members of the a&s;&s;embly, the members of the convention, and other creditors of the &s;tate; 400,000 dollars remain now in your Trea&s;ury &s;ubject to the appropriation of the pre&s;ent Legi&s;lature.</P>

<P N="4">4th.

<PB N="98" REF="035588_0101_1005F85A0E1890F8">for that purpo&s;e was but thirty thou&s;and dollars, and funds to a greater amount were then in the trea&s;ury unappropriated: And becau&s;e no &s;tate or nation is ju&s;tifi|ed in wantonly di&s;&s;ipating its property or revenues, and a legal alienation of which can only take place from the mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing nece&s;&s;ity; and the territory attempted to be di&s;po&s;ed of, was the &s;aid u&s;urped law valid, was wantonly di&s;&s;ipated, it being di&s;po&s;ed of for the trifling &s;um of five hundred thou&s;and dollars, a &s;um not adequate to the anu|al quit rents &s;uch lands were charged with previou&s;ly to the revolution of the briti&s;h King; which wanton di&s;&s;i|pation cannot be for the good of the &s;tate.</P>
<P N="5">5th.

<P N="6">6th.

<P N="5"><PB N="99" REF="035588_0102_1005F830633A3810">

<P>And whereas the &s;aid u&s;urped law pa&s;&s;ed on the &s;eventh day of January, one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and ninety-five, is al&s;o repugnant to the afore cited &s;ixteenth &s;ection, in as much as it is repugnant to the &s;eventeenth or &s;ub&s;e|quent &s;ection of the &s;aid fir&s;t article, which declares: They (the legi&s;lature) &s;hall have power to alter the boun|daries of the pre&s;ent counties, and to lay off new ones, as well out of the counties already laid off, as out of the other territory belonging to the &s;tate.

<P>And whereas in and by the articles of confederation en|tered into and finally ratified on the fir&s;t of March, one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and eighty one, by the then thir|teen &s;tates of America, the territory within the limits of each of the &s;aid &s;tates is to each of them re&s;pectively con|firmed and guaranteed, fir&s;t by the &s;econd article, to wit, "Each &s;tate retains its &s;overeignty, freedom, and inde|pendence, and power, juri&s;diction and right, which is not by the confederation expre&s;&s;ly delegated to the United States in Congre&s;s a&s;&s;embled."

<P>And whereas in and by the definitive treaty of peace &s;igned at Paris on the third of September, one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and eighty-three, the boundaries of the United.

<P>And whereas dive&s;ted of all fundamental and con&s;titu|tional authority which the &s;aid u&s;urped act might be de|clared by its advocates, and tho&s;e who claim under it, to be founded on, fraud has been practi&s;ed to obtain it, and the grant under it. And it is a fundamental principle both of law and equity, that there cannot be a wrong without a remedy, and the &s;tate and the citizens thereof have &s;uf|fered a mo&s;t grievous injury in the barter of their rights by the &s;aid u&s;urped act and grants, and there is no court exi&s;ting if the dignity of the &s;tate would permit her entering one, for the trial of fraud and collu|&s;ion of individuals, or to conte&s;t her &s;overeignty with them, whereby the remedy for &s;o notorious an injury could be obtained: and it can no where better lay than with the repre&s;entatives of the people cho&s;en by them, af|ter due promulgation by the grand juries of mo&s;t of the counties of the &s;tate, of the means practi&s;ed, and by the remon&s;trances of the people to the convention, held on the tenth day of May, one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and ninety-five, &s;etting forth the atrocious &s;peculation, cor|ruption and collu&s;ion, by which the &s;aid u&s;urped act and grants were obtained.</P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="035588_0106_1005F83AFAFBD2B0">
And whereas the &s;aid petitions and remon&s;trances of the good people compo&s;ing the &s;tate, to the &s;aid late conven|tion held at Loui&s;ville on the &s;aid tenth day of May, one thou&s;and &s;even hundred and ninety-five, produced a re|&s;olution of that body in the following words: "<HI>Re&s;olved,</HI> That it is the opinion of this convention, from the num|bers, re&s;pectability, and ground of complaint &s;tated in the &s;undry petitions laid before them, that this is a &s;ub|ject of importance meriting legi&s;lative deliberation. <HI>Or|dered therefore,</HI> That &s;uch petitions be pre&s;erved by the Secretary, and laid before the next legi&s;lature at their en|&s;uing &s;e&s;&s;ion."

<P>Re&s;olved that it be, and hereby is, repre&s;ented to the &s;tates of North-Carolina and Georgia, that the lands which have been ceded by the other &s;tates in compliance
<PB N="107" REF="035588_0110_1005F8441596B008">with the recommendations of this body, are now &s;elling in large quantities for public &s;ecurities; that the deeds of ce&s;&s;ion from the different &s;tates have been made without annexing an expre&s;s condition that they &s;hould not ope|rate till the other &s;tates, under like circum&s;tances made &s;imilar ce&s;&s;ion; and that congre&s;s have &s;uch faith in the ju&s;tice and magnanimity of the &s;tates of North-Carolina and Georgia, that they only think it nece&s;&s;ary to call their attention to the&s;e circum&s;tances, not doubting but upon con&s;ideration of the &s;ubject, they will feel tho&s;e obliga|tions which will induce &s;imilar ce&s;&s;ions, and ju&s;tify that confidence which has been placed in them.</P>

<HEAD>No. XVII. CASE.</HEAD>
<P>The legi&s;lature of the &s;tate of Georgia by an act of the 7th January 1795, directed a &s;ale to be made of a certain
<PB N="108" REF="035588_0111_1005F848737EB958">tract of land, therein de&s;cribed to James Gunn, and others, by the name of the Georgia company; upon certain con|ditions therein &s;pecified. The &s;ale was made pur&s;uant to the act: the conditions of &s;ale were performed by the pur|cha&s;ers, and a regular grant made to them accordingly of the &s;aid tract of land. Sub&s;equent thereto, the &s;aid legi&s;|lature has pa&s;&s;ed an act, whereby on the &s;ugge&s;tion of un|con&s;titutionality for various rea&s;ons (prout the act) and al&s;o of fraud and corruption in application to the legi&s;la|tive body, the fir&s;t act, and the grants thereupon; are declared null and void.</P>
<P>On the foregoing ca&s;e, the opinion of coun&s;el is de|&s;ired, whether the title of the grantees and their a&s;&s;igns, the latter being <HI>bonafide,</HI> purcha&s;ers of them for valuable con&s;iderations be valid; or whether the la&s;t mentioned act be of force to annul the grant?</P>
<DIV3 TYPE="answer">
<HEAD>ANSWER.</HEAD>
<P>Never having examined the title of the &s;tate of Geor|gia to the lands in que&s;tion, I have no knowledge whe|ther that &s;tate was it&s;elf entitled to them and in capacity to make a valid grant. I can therefore have no opinion on this point.&mdash;But a&s;&s;uming it in the argument as a fact, that the &s;tate of Georgia had at the time of the grant a good title to the land, I hold that the revocation of it is void, and that the grant is &s;till in force.</P>
<P>Without pretending to judge of the original merits or demerits of the purcha&s;ers, it may be &s;afely &s;aid to be a contravention of the fir&s;t principles of natural ju&s;tice and &s;ocial policy, without any judicial deci&s;ion of facts, by a po&s;itive act of legi&s;lature, to revoke a grant of property re|gularly made for valuable con&s;ideration, under legi&s;la|tive authority, to the prejudice even of third per&s;ons on every &s;uppo&s;ition innocent of the alledged fraud or cor|ruption; and it may be added that the precedent is new of revoking a grant on the &s;ugge&s;tion of corruption of a legi&s;lative body.&mdash;Nor do I perceive &s;ufficient ground for the &s;ugge&s;tion of uncon&s;titutionality in the fir&s;t act.</P>
<P>In addition to the&s;e general con&s;iderations, placing the revocation in a very unfavourable light, the con&s;titu|tion of the United States, article fir&s;t, &s;ection tenth declares that no &s;tate &s;hall pa&s;s a law impairing the obli|gations of contract. This mu&s;t be equivalent to &s;aying
<PB N="109" REF="035588_0112_1005F84A09EE6778" MS="y">no &s;tate &s;hall pa&s;s a law revoking, invalidating, or altering a contract. Every grant from one to another, whether the grantor be a &s;tate or an individual, is virtually a contract that the grantee &s;hall hold and enjoy the thing granted a|gain&s;t the grantor, and his repre&s;entatives. It therefore appears to me that taking the terms of the con&s;titution, in their large &s;en&s;e, and giving them effect according to the general &s;pirit and policy of the provi&s;ions: the Revoca|tion of the grant by the act of the legi&s;latiure of Georgia, may ju&s;tly be con&s;idered as contrary to the con&s;titution of the United States, and therefore null. And that the courts of the United States in ca&s;es within their juri&s;diction will be likely to pronounce it &s;o.</P>
