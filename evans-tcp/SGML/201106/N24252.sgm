<P>THE abundant diffidence and anxiety, which, at all times, &s;o ju&s;tly belong to me, are, at the pre|&s;ent, partly lo&s;t in the flow of &s;ympathetic joy and gratitude, which animate my heart to felicitate you on this happy meeting. While &s;ome of our fellow-creatures are roaming in the gloomy fore&s;t as bea&s;ts of prey; or, in wild enthu&s;ia&s;m and dark &s;uper&s;ti|tion, celebrating the rites of idol and unknown gods; or exulting, with barbarous plea&s;ure, in the excruciating torture of captive enemies: while mill|ions are draging out a mi&s;erable exi&s;tence in the dreary countries of ignorance and de&s;poti&s;m, or more awfully bleeding under the cur&s;ed la&s;h of &s;lave|ry; and others, with unfeeling hearts, wantonly rioting upon the&s;e &s;ufferings of their brother-crea|tures, and the bounties of Heaven: while thou|&s;ands are armed with the implements of death in order
<PB N="6" REF="032062_0006_0FF109DD8DDC85E0">to cut and mangle the bodies of their fellow-men, and to &s;hed each others blood, and whole nations are experiencing all the horrors of war: we, my Friends, in the ample enjoyment of national liberty, pro&s;per|ity and peace, are, this day convened by an occa|&s;ion connected with every thing great and valuable to man. This day, by the munificience of an all-wi&s;e and directing Providence, we celebrate the Ded|ication of a literary in&s;titution: an in&s;titution, which, by the grace of God, we would &s;acredly con&s;ecrate to literature, virtue, and the true dignity of man. Every circum&s;tance of the occa&s;ion is calcu|lated to touch the mo&s;t noble feelings of our nature; to &s;ublime our hearts to the throne of God on the &s;wift wings of gratitude and love. And while the occa&s;ion irre&s;i&s;tibly claims a tribute of gratitude to the Father of lights and God of all grace; at the &s;ame time, it claims more irre&s;i&s;tibly, if po&s;&s;ible, our mo&s;t ardent prayers; that the God of &s;cience, order and virtue, would enable and di&s;po&s;e us ever to hold in view the &s;ublime objects to which our in&s;titution is, this day, &s;olemnly con&s;ecrated; and that tho&s;e, who are more immediately concerned, may be en|dowed from on high, with all that wi&s;dom and for|titude, which, from time to time, may be nece&s;&s;ary to direct the in&s;titution in the ways of truth and vir|tue. Neither can tho&s;e, who are intimately concern|ed in the pro&s;perity of the Academy, re&s;t its con&s;e|cration to knowledge and virtue, on thank&s;giving
<PB N="7" REF="032062_0007_0FF109E180087BE0">and prayer alone; they will be con&s;trained, from the powerful voice of duty and intere&s;t, to co-operate with the all-bountiful hand of Providence, by their mo&s;t ardent re&s;olutions, and &s;pirited exertions.</P>
<P>THUS congratulating each other on the opening of our promi&s;ing Seminary, and, together with thank&s;giving, by prayer and pious re&s;olutions, &s;a|credly dedicating it to literature and morality, our minds are naturally arre&s;ted by the great, the all-intere&s;ting &s;ubject of Education&mdash;Here the import|ance of education, at once, opens upon our view a wide field, rich with many of the mo&s;t intere&s;ting particulars.</P>
<P>EXPATIATING in this delightful field, the objects which education ought to embrace fir&s;t catch out at|tention. The&s;e objects, I conceive, are, principally. Literature and Morality: by the former to inform and direct the under&s;tanding; by the latter to melior|ate the heart, to conform the affections, will, and conduct to the rules of rectitude, or will of our Ma|ker and great Moral Governor.</P>
<P>WHATEVER might have been the rea&s;on, either &s;ome deficiency in tho&s;e who have been employed in conducting youth, or an idea that the heart is unal|terable otherwi&s;e than by an immediate miracle of the Divine hand, or &s;ome other rea&s;on, it is a mel|ancholy truth, that the morality of youth has not been con&s;idered, &s;o much as their literature, the province of the in&s;tructor. While unwearied pains
<PB N="8" REF="032062_0008_0FF109E3C5BB1250">have been taken to give learning to youth, to give them &s;kill in the arts, and knowledge in the &s;ciences; the habitudes of the heart, their di&s;po&s;itions, ta&s;tes, and &s;entiments, on which moral character is grafted, have been too much neglected. There is doubtle&s;s great connection between truth and virtue, between the under&s;tanding and the moral habitudes of the &s;oul; &s;o that by informing the under&s;tanding there is &s;trong probability that the morality will be im|proved: yet it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed that this connection is not an in&s;eperable one; &s;ince we have the unhap|pine&s;s, &s;ometimes, to &s;ee gentlemen of the fir&s;t learn|ing and abilities, the lowe&s;t &s;unk in depravity and vice. We have the unhappine&s;s, &s;ometimes, to &s;ee &s;ouls widely expanded in knowledge, awfully macu|lated with the dark &s;hades of vice; angels in under|&s;tanding, devils in conduct. Hence we &s;ee educa|tion, which is de&s;igned to prepare youth for the &s;equel of life, to render them u&s;eful, re&s;pectable, and happy, will be immen&s;ely deficient, unle&s;s it be profe&s;&s;edly extended to their morality, as well as their literature. The con&s;titution of human nature proves the propriety and importance of doing this. The prominent principles of our nature are tho&s;e of Imitation and Habit. Youth are ever learning to do what they &s;ee others around them doing, and the&s;e imitations grow into habits. Fact and experience prove to us that every function of the body, every faculty and capacity of the mind are, more or le&s;s,
<PB N="9" REF="032062_0009_0FF109E553D12690">affected and directed by imitation and habit. How infinitely important then is it, in early youth, when every power, and capacity is pliable, and &s;u&s;ceptible of any direction or impre&s;&s;ion, &s;o to manage educa|tion, that imitation may turn the young mind to virtue as well as knowledge, and habit confirm him in both. Not only then are we to educate our youth in arts and &s;ciences, but al&s;o, as &s;aith the Apo&s;tle, <HI>in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>BEING &s;o convinced of its con&s;equence, I can|not forbear adding Manner, as another object which education ought to embrace. Tho' the head be filled with &s;cience, and the heart with &s;entiment, though knowledge and virtue mark every trait of the charac|ter, con&s;traint and aukwardne&s;s of manner will, in a mea&s;ure, render the per&s;on forbiding and repul&s;ive, le&s;&s;on his influence, and detract from his u&s;efulne&s;s. Hence while education &s;trives to form the mind to learning and virtue, it will not fail to embelli&s;h both with the ornaments of ea&s;e and grace of manner. One ble&s;&s;ed with &s;uch an education, will command that influence which his &s;ub&s;tantial acquirements ju&s;tly challenge, and will diffu&s;e, wherever he goes, light, virtue, love and joy.</P>
<P>HAVING pointed at the great objects which edu|cation ought to embrace, the importance of it will more fully appear by opening our eyes upon that dignity and happine&s;s which the Creator de&s;igned for the hu|man race. When we analize man, raptures of &s;ol|emn
<PB N="10" REF="032062_0010_0FF109E721986B08">joy and gratitude mu&s;t fill our hearts to &s;ee what greatne&s;s, &s;ublimity, glory and happine&s;s our faith|ful Creator de&s;igned for him! The erect po&s;ture, the curious and wonderful &s;tructure, and the com|manding countenance of man, all indicate the &s;upe|rior powers of his &s;oul. As an intellectual being, how wonderful is man! Through his &s;en&s;es, as &s;o many windows to his dark body, the knowledge of the ma|terial world is beamed upon his mind. By reflecting on the powers and operations of his own mind, he ri&s;es to a knowledge of the &s;piritual world, of angels, of God. By di&s;cernment and rea&s;oning he &s;ees the agreement and di&s;agreement of his ideas; the broad effulgence of knowledge and truth illumine and ex|pand his &s;oul. Curio&s;ity urges his ardent pur&s;uits of knowledge, and, through an equi&s;ite &s;en&s;e of truth, his feelings are enraptured with her view. By mem|ory he calls from oblivion &s;cenes that are pa&s;t; from experience corrects his errors, and reenjoys the de|lights of life. His imagination wings his &s;oul with fire; traver&s;es all that is grand and &s;ublime in the univer&s;e; a&s;cends the &s;kies, &s;urveys the &s;hining orbes and bright intelligencies of immen&s;ity, and, from nature, ri&s;es to nature's God. As an active and moral being, &s;till more wonderful is man! His body, formed to a variety of operation, is pliable and en|ergetic; his mind is quick and powerful as the elec|tric &s;park. His &s;oul is winged with the mo&s;t animating pa&s;&s;ions. De&s;ire of happine&s;s and aver&s;ion to mi&s;ery,
<PB N="11" REF="032062_0011_0FF109EBDB25EF98">love and hatred, hope and fear, rou&s;e all the faculties of man, and command his greate&s;t, noble&s;t exertions. Implanted in the heart is con&s;cience, the monitor of Heaven, as by the hand of God, diffu&s;ing peace and joy through the virtuous &s;oul; and puni&s;hing vice by the torture of remor&s;e, and the awful forebodings of guilt. Thus endowed, man has the honour of be|ing made capable of religion; of ri&s;ing to a knowledge of the invi&s;ible God, the Creator and Governor of the univer&s;e, of his attributes and will; capable of the &s;ublime affections of piety, of gratitude and love, adoration and obedience. To complete the dignity and happine&s;s of man, God hath con&s;tituted him a free and moral agent; while &s;upporting, delegated to his mind an ample, an unembarra&s;&s;ed power to di|rect all his active faculties. So exalted is the human race in the &s;cale of beings, that while the Creator, of his other works &s;aid, They were very good; of man He &s;aith, In the image of God created He him! If we, for a moment, look without us, we &s;hall be &s;till farther convinced of the dignity and happine&s;s de|&s;igned for our race. Man is con&s;tituted king of earth. Hence the revolving &s;ea&s;ons, the air and fouls of heaven, the va&s;t ocean and its inhabitants, and the cattle upon a thou&s;and hills, all be&s;peak his glory. But if we ju&s;t glance an eye of faith into our holy re|ligion, what has hitherto been &s;aid of human great|ne&s;s dwindles to a point. Here we find <HI>life and im|mortality,</HI> beyond the grave, <HI>brought to light.</HI>
<PB N="12" REF="032062_0012_0FF109EE2E3B4420">Here we find, <HI>Eye hath not &s;een, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things,</HI> the dignity and happine&s;s, <HI>which God hath prepared for</HI> the virtuous. And, what is more than all, that all the human race might be rai&s;ed to this invi&s;ible height of perfection, the ble&s;&s;ed Emmanuel, the only Son and image of God, left his throne in heaven for a humble re&s;idence on earth; a&s;&s;umed humanity, and even died to di&s;embarra&s;s us from tho&s;e depravities, which might &s;ully our glory.</P>
<P>SUCH are the greatne&s;s and value of human na|ture, and &s;uch her powers and capacities. But where, in this world, is much of all this known, or realized and enjoyed? The experience of fact replies, only there, where have been enjoyed the ble&s;&s;ings of ed|ucation. All the&s;e intellectual, active, and moral powers and capacities, experience &s;hows us, are under the influence of the great principles of IMITATION and HABIT, which Deity, for the wi&s;e&s;t purpo&s;es, implanted in our nature; and hence, by the powerful hand of a well-directed education, and due attention, may be va&s;tly heightened and improved; or, by ne|glect and vicious indulgence depre&s;&s;ed, enervated, if not finally de&s;troyed. Let us, for a moment, look at the &s;avage of the wilderne&s;s natively po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of all this dignity and value of nature, but untouched by the moulding hand of education. De&s;titute of all the arts of civilized life, he roves a naked animal in the uncultivated fore&s;t. His intellectual powers ly|ing
<PB N="13" REF="032062_0013_0FF109F02AA45608">unexerci&s;ed and undirected, his ideas, his lan|guage, and his knowledge are confined within the &s;mall compa&s;s of his cha&s;e. His pa&s;&s;ions undi&s;ci|plined, are ungovernable, impetuous, and awful. Ignorant of his own origin and value, of God and religion, he adores the &s;un and &s;tars, and bends his knee to the rude image formed by his own un&s;kilful hand. And not only is the heart, which embraces the whole family of man, con&s;trained to weep over millions of the human race, who, through the de|ficiency of education, are low &s;unk in barbarity; but even in civilized life, where the means of educa|tion, and the light of religion are enjoyed, even among the highly privileged Americans, the tear of humanity is frequently &s;tarted, to &s;ee many of our brethren, &s;ome of whom the mo&s;t excellent of na|ture's works, through the neglect of education, and by bad example, in a &s;ituation almo&s;t as pitiable as that of the roving Tartar. How infinitely different is the character of him, whom a well-conducted edu|cation, and due attention, and the grace of God, have brought upon the &s;tage of action! In him all the noble powers and capacities of human nature are improved and exalted, and &s;till progre&s;&s;ing. Truth and knowledge illumine and expand his mind. His under&s;tanding is broad as the heavens. Swayed by rea&s;on, his imagination and his pa&s;&s;ions are calm, and regular as the heavenly orbs. Un&s;hackled by &s;uper&s;tition, his candour is diffu&s;ive as the light. His
<PB N="14" REF="032062_0014_0FF109F283BF07B8">con&s;cience unhurt by the Torpedo of vice, is tender and delicate as the &s;en&s;itive plant. Freed from pre|judice, his faith, founded on evidence, is firm as the overla&s;ting mountains. Flowing from conviction, his morality is &s;teady as the &s;un in his cour&s;e. His zeal and devotion, being according to knowledge, are, without enthu&s;ia&s;m, uniform, rational, &s;ublime. Such an one is dignified and happy in him&s;elf, hon|ourable to his connections, u&s;eful to the world, loved, and re&s;pected by all, ble&s;&s;ed of Heaven, and pre|paring for the &s;ociety of angels in the city of God.</P>
<P>BUT the field of the importance of education is not yet fully explored. Widening our view upon nations, &s;till greater objects arre&s;t our attention. What but the ble&s;&s;ings of education rai&s;e the impro|ved and civilized nations of Europe &s;o far above the roving tribes of Africa? Tho' the arts of civilized life may originate from nece&s;&s;ity, yet it is by the im|provements of knowledge that their principles are in|ve&s;tigated, without which they never will be carried to any con&s;iderable perfection. The principles un|folded by mechanical philo&s;ophy have given birth to all that variety of machinery by which labour is abridged, and the arts of life improved. Commerce very much owes her exi&s;tence to the advancement of &s;cience. By this means the va&s;t ocean is navigated, the mo&s;t di&s;tant nations, which it flows between, made acquainted with each other, and their various productions exchanged to the advantage of both. In
<PB N="15" REF="032062_0015_0FF109F5E4AD9278">&s;hort, "in civilized life every thing is effected by art and &s;kill," both which, in a great mea&s;ure, are the gifts of education&mdash;"Whence, by the way, a per&s;on who is provided with neither, (and neither can be acquired without exerci&s;e and in&s;truction) will be u&s;ele&s;s; and he that is u&s;ele&s;s will generally be, at the &s;ame time, mi&s;chievous to the community. So that to &s;end an uneducated child into the world is in|jurious to the re&s;t of mankind; it is little better than to turn out a mad dog, or a wild bea&s;t into the &s;treets."</P>
<P>BUT the infinite importance of education, in a national view, appears in &s;till brighter colours, from this eternal truth, That the mode of government in any nation, will always be moulded by the &s;tate of education. The throne of tyranny is founded on ig|norance. Literature and liberty go hand in hand. Every ray of knowledge which darts through the dark cloud of ignorance that re&s;ts on an in&s;laved nation, threatens death to the de&s;pot. The dark ages of goth|eci&s;m opened an ample field for eccle&s;ia&s;tical tyranny. While the Pope of Rome and his &s;atellites e&s;tabli&s;hed, in the ignorant minds of Europe, the doctrine of the Pope's infallibility, that he was Peter's &s;ucce&s;&s;or, vicegerent of Chri&s;t, and held the keys of heaven, the kings of Europe trembled before him, and laid their trea&s;ures at his feet. As the &s;un of &s;cience has been ri&s;ing upon Europe, the papal throne has been melting; and the pro&s;pect now is, that his holine&s;s will &s;oon be no more. In tho&s;e dark ages al&s;o, the ridiculous
<PB N="16" REF="032062_0016_0FF0D388CA2D31B0">doctrine of the divine right of kings being in&s;tilled into the ignorant mind, the authority of de&s;pots became the authority of God, and their &s;ubjects prepared tamely to &s;uffer every indignity. But as the increa&s;e of knowledge has gradually given tho&s;e na|tions better notions of the equal rights of men, ty|ranny has been proportionally declining. Let general information, and a ju&s;t knowledge of the rights of man be diffu&s;ed through the great bulk of the people in any nation, and it will not be in the power of all the combined de&s;pots on earth to en&s;lave them. Of this truth France may be an example. Of the influence of education on government, the hi&s;tory of our own nation affords us a mo&s;t happy &s;pecimen. Convinced of the va&s;t con&s;equence of literature our pious ance&s;tors gave the earlie&s;t attention to the edu|cation of their youth. By this means, information was generally diffu&s;ed through the Colonies, and many of our citizens were profound in &s;cience, the rights of man, the hi&s;tories of nations, and political wi&s;dom. Thus guarded, vain were the attempts of Britain to oppre&s;s us. Separation was the con&s;e|quence; independence the i&s;&s;ue. Guided by the &s;ame potent hand of literature, our lives are crowned with a government which &s;ecures to us all the ble&s;&s;ings of &s;ociety, and civil liberty. That we may tran&s;mit to po&s;terity our happy government pure and uncor|rupted, let the glories of education ever be our theme.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="032062_0017_0FF109FA8B5BBED0">
WERE it not unnece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay more on this head, the ine&s;timable value of education would &s;till va&s;tly magnify by viewing its connection with our holy religion.</P>
<P>THOUGH at fir&s;t, chri&s;tianity was miraculou&s;ly &s;ent from heaven to earth, by the hand of a glorious mediator, the continuation and propagation of it, in the world, depends, under Providence, almo&s;t entire|ly on education. "Chri&s;tianity is an hi&s;torical reli|gion, founded on facts which are related to have pa&s;&s;|ed, upon di&s;cour&s;es which were held, and letters which were written, in a remote age, and di&s;tant country. The records of the&s;e things are pre&s;erved in languages, which have long cea&s;ed to be &s;poken in any part of the world." Obvious it is then that education, and mo&s;t probably the clergy, are nece&s;|&s;ary to perpetuate the evidences of our holy religion, and to interpret tho&s;e ancient writings, in which this religion is contained.</P>
<P>NOT to dwell longer on this mo&s;t copious head; filled with the infinite con&s;equence of education to man, the mind is naturally turned, and mo&s;t power|fully excited to con&s;ider the way and means by which it may be mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sfully advanced.</P>
<P>ONE of the mo&s;t important particulars is, that the great work of education be begun in early life. As &s;oon as the powers and capacities of the mind begin to unfold, the directing and fo&s;tering hand of educa|tion &s;hould be applied. The time of human life is
<PB N="18" REF="032062_0018_0FF109FCDA55DA10">too &s;hort and valuable to &s;uffer a moment of it to pa&s;s away without improvement. Be&s;ide, the work of acquiring a good education, filling the mind with knowledge, and moulding it into virtuous habits, is a work of va&s;t labour. Life is &s;hort; &s;cience and improvement infinite.</P>
<P>NOT only &s;o, but &s;uch is the con&s;titution of nature, the young mind can not be &s;tationary. The great principles of imitation and habit will operate. Hence, if the &s;kilful hand of education does not, as its faculties unfold, turn the mind right, by direct|ing the&s;e principles, they will, through bad example and indulgence, turn it wrong. And, what is more, the turn, which the young mind receives while it is tender and pliable, and its powers and capacities are unfolding and maturing, is very &s;tubborn, and, probably, will, in a mea&s;ure, continue until, and, awful thought! beyond death. Perhaps under five years of age, &s;ome impre&s;&s;ions and principles are &s;et upon the mind and manners of the child, which he will carry through life. Experience has, long &s;ince, drawn this ob&s;ervation into a decided maxim. A great poet expre&s;&s;es thus:
<Q><L>"Tis education forms the common mind;</L>
<L>"Ju&s;t as the twig is bent, the tree's inclin'd."</L></Q>
And one, who, for almo&s;t three thou&s;and years, has been renowned for his &s;uperior wi&s;dom, has left us this all-intere&s;ting maxim, in &s;till more deci&s;ive terms. <HI>Train up a child in the way he &s;hould go;
<PB N="19" REF="032062_0019_0FF109FFE3C10F98">and when he is old, he will not depart from it.</HI> Up|on the&s;e principles it is that we &s;o urgently recom|mend early education. Upon the&s;e principles it al&s;o is, that a late education is encumbered with many embarra&s;&s;ments. Entering late upon education, the Scholar not only has his learning to obtain, but bad habits and erroneous prejudices to correct. Very few have abilities adequate to the arduous ta&s;k. Though &s;uch an one may become accurate in theory, it is lucky if his old habits do not cau&s;e him to blun|der in practice. Though his knowledge may be fine, he is very liable to have his manner con&s;trained, and his execution bad.</P>
<P>FEMALE education is another particular very e&s;&s;ential as a means to its general, and far advance|ment.</P>
<P>WE have &s;een, education ought to begin with the beginnings of under&s;tanding. At this eventful period of life, the little folks are in the arms of their mothers. Has the mother been well educated, is the tender parent a good preceptre&s;s, the fortunate child is at the be&s;t &s;chool in the univer&s;e, while in its mother's lap. As the faculties of the young mind expand, &s;he will with a delicate and &s;kilful hand nur|ture and direct it to knowledge and virtue. The pupil being con&s;tantly with, and &s;trongly attached to the mother, will a&s;&s;ume her as an example of per|fection, and imitate her every look, word, and ge&s;|ture. The&s;e imitations will &s;oon grow into habits,
<PB N="20" REF="032062_0020_0FF10A016E8A8530">and probably fix traits upon the child's mind, &s;peech, and manners, which will be durable as life. Hence the maxim, as is the parent &s;o is the child; and hence the inconceivable con&s;equence of female educa|tion.</P>
<P>BESIDE, &s;uch is the happy con&s;titution of nature, that wherever Ladies are highly improved by a well directed and refined education, there the gentlemen will &s;oon become &s;o. It is an aphori&s;m, which it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed carries much truth with it, that the fair part of creation rule the world. Would they, guided by the wi&s;e dictates of a virtuous edu|cation, give their approbation only to tho&s;e who were, (con&s;idering their circum&s;tances) duly in|formed and virtuous, we might venture to affirm, &s;carcely an uneducated, irregular man would be &s;een in &s;ociety. Permit me then, Ladies, to &s;ay, on you it very much re&s;ts to fix the boundaries of human im|provement. The Creator hath put it in your power to reform the world. Let not the idle, di&s;&s;ipated cha|racter &s;hare your care&s;&s;es, and the work is done. Doing this, you will have the honour of doing more than all the magi&s;trates, morali&s;ts, and preachers in the world.</P>
<P>WHEN we con&s;ider the dignity, value, and happine&s;s a good education adds to the human mind, how &s;urpri&s;ing it is that, in this, one half of the human race have been &s;o ba&s;ely neglected!&mdash;e&s;peci|ally when we con&s;ider how a refined education in
<PB N="21" REF="032062_0021_0FF10A03CB5CA930">them reforms the world. This doubtle&s;s is a trait of barbarity. In the &s;avage &s;tate, where &s;trength is honour, the delicate female is depre&s;&s;ed far below the dignity of her rank. As civilization and im|provement advance in families or nations, female education gains ground, Ladies a&s;&s;ume their proper rank, and command re&s;pect. Happy am I to ob&s;erve this trait of barbarity in our country, rapidly wearing away. May that glorious era &s;oon commence, when a virtuous and refined education &s;hall adorn the fair daughters of America&mdash;then di&s;&s;ipated gallantry &s;hall be bani&s;hed &s;ociety, and mode&s;t virtue be triumphant.</P>
<P>IT is obvious to ob&s;erve, that Good In&s;truction is another very e&s;&s;ential particular in the means of advancing education.</P>
<P>IT is as ea&s;y for the &s;cholar to learn right as wrong. Let him be taught right, and his learning will be &s;o of cour&s;e. Whether he be &s;o or not, the &s;cholar, as he ought, thinks his teacher is right; follows his precepts, and copies his example. On the&s;e truths the following general rule is erected for the election of In&s;tructors: Such a character, as you would wi&s;h your child to be, choo&s;e for his in|&s;tructor. Would you wi&s;h your child to be a blun|derer and a gue&s;&s;er in learning, without points or ac|curacy; thus let his in&s;tructor be, and the work is done. Would you wi&s;h him vulgar in his diction, horrid in his pronunciation, and aukward in his manners; then choo&s;e an in&s;tructor of &s;uch a mould.
<PB N="22" REF="032062_0022_0FF10A062445C828">But, as better &s;uited to this enlightened age, in which we have the happine&s;s of living, do you wi&s;h, as I am per&s;uaded you do, to have your children right and accurate in their learning, ea&s;y and graceful in their manners, and &s;entimental and regular in their morals, then choo&s;e for their In&s;tructor, a &s;cholar, and gentleman, and a chri&s;tian, and your ardent and no|ble wi&s;hes, by the ble&s;&s;ings of Heaven, will be grati|fied.</P>
<P>IT is mo&s;t painful and gloomy to the patriot and philanthropi&s;t, to ob&s;erve, that the in&s;tuction of our youth has, through mi&s;take, or deficiency of patron|age, too generally fallen into inadequate hands. But we are animated, happy in the con&s;ideration, that the good &s;en&s;e of the people is now rapidly correcting this mi&s;take. Raptures of enthu&s;ia&s;m fill our hearts in anticipating the golden era, when So|crate&s;es &s;hall again be &s;chool-ma&s;ters.</P>
<P>BUT in addition to good in&s;truction, there mu&s;t be great attention and exertion on the part of the &s;cholar.</P>
<P>WHERE the work to be performed is great, the time to perform it in &s;hort, and the reward ample, every po&s;&s;ible exertion is naturally called into act. This, my young Friends, is your &s;ituation, who are making the fir&s;t advances in education. Your object, as you have already &s;een, is mo&s;t great and noble: it is the improvement of your natures in every thing amiable, virtuous, and prai&s;e-worthy; that you may
<PB N="23" REF="032062_0023_0FF10A086319E2B8">be &s;atisfied with, and happy in your&s;elves, joy to your parents, honor to your in&s;tructors, u&s;eful in this world, and happy in the next. To obtain that good education, which &s;ecures the&s;e great objects, is an amazing work: a work which calls for your greate&s;t attention, care, re&s;olution, indu&s;try, and mo&s;t ardent prayers. Many difficulties are to be encountered, many &s;elf-denials a&s;&s;umed. The hill of a literary and virtuous education is, in &s;ome parts, &s;teep, crag|gy, and laberious. But be not di&s;courage; its a&s;&s;ent is more ea&s;y as you advance, and its &s;ublime &s;ummit is irradiated with a broad effulgence of glo|ry. On this &s;ummit fix your eyes, and no exertions will &s;eem too great, no attention tedious.</P>
<P>ESPECIALLY will this laborious attention be urged upon you, by the con&s;ideration of the &s;hort|ne&s;s of youth. When the age of manhood arrives, as it &s;oon will, the great objects of life, profe&s;&s;ion, dome&s;tic e&s;tabli&s;hment and cares, duties to your country, and extended connections will crowd up|on you, and command your attention. The age of youth, when the mind is free from all the&s;e cares, is the time which God hath appointed to obtain education, and prepare for manhood. This time is too &s;hort and precious to &s;quander a moment of it, in u&s;ele&s;s trifles and amu&s;ements. It is a mi&s;take that youth is the age for idlene&s;s and diver&s;ion: it is the age for education, on which depend your fu|ture pro&s;perity, and greatne&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="032062_0024_0FF10A09FA95A288">
I have re&s;erved for the la&s;t place, one of the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential means to the promotion of literature, I mean, that of the encouragement and patronage of Government, and gentlemen of di&s;tinction and a|bility.</P>
<P>HONOUR and profit are objects which have a very commanding influence on the minds of men. Let the government of a nation, and its able cha|racters, who have the&s;e to be&s;tow, amply confer them on teachers, and virtuous literary merit; and that nation will &s;oon become di&s;tingui&s;hed in ed|ucation&mdash;Gentlemen of the fir&s;t character and abili|ties will a&s;pire to the noble profe&s;&s;ion of in&s;tructing youth&mdash;Youth will be animated, enthu&s;ia&s;tic in their attention, and thou&s;ands of citizens emulous in the cour&s;e of improvement. The golden ages of literature, which are immortalized on the page of hi&s;tory, in Greece, Rome, Florence, France and Eng|land, all are replete with facts which te&s;tify to us the va&s;t con&s;equence of this encouragement and patron|age. But we need not go to di&s;tant ages and na|tions for the proof of this; our own pro&s;perous coun|try affords us a &s;ufficient one. Tho&s;e States in the Union are the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed for the general dif|fu&s;ion of information, where the Legi&s;lature of the State and able individuals have been the mo&s;t active and liberal in their encouragement and patronage. I pre&s;ume we &s;hall not injure our &s;i&s;ter &s;tates if we &s;ay Ma&s;&s;achu&s;etts ju&s;tly claims a rank among tho&s;e
<PB N="25" REF="032062_0025_0FF10A0BAB8AD5D8">of this de&s;cription. Numerous, noble and di&s;tin|gui&s;hed are the monuments of her exertion in the glo|rious cau&s;e of education. On the&s;e we might exhau&s;t the language of panegyric; but the recent in&s;tance of the liberal patronage of literature, which ornaments Bri&s;tol County, and felicitates our pre&s;ent meeting, more immediately commands out gratitude, and claims a tribute of acknowledgment. The voice of duty is, let the magnanimous &s;entiments of patrioti&s;m be a grateful return&mdash;The voice of duty al&s;o calls for a grateful tribute to the noble patronage of individ|uals, with whom the Government have intru&s;ted their character and liberal depo&s;ite&mdash;And, I pre|&s;ume, with my own, I &s;hall gratify the feelings of my audience, if I add, as another claim of our grati|tude, the &s;pirited, but, di&s;intere&s;ted exertions of a di&s;tingui&s;hed character,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">General <HI>DAVID COBB,</HI> who removed from <HI>Taunton</HI> is <HI>Gould&s;bury,</HI> in the <HI>Province of Maine,</HI> a few weeks before the Academy was opened.</NOTE> who now ble&s;&s;es ano|ther clime.</P>
<P>PERMIT me to &s;ay Gentlemen, by accepting the honourable appointment of Tru&s;tees to our infant Seminary, you accept a great and Solemn tru&s;t. The expectations of the community are ju&s;tly upon you. On you it re&s;ts to manage the In&s;titution, that it may, under your au&s;pices, effect the all-important objects for which God, and our Legi&s;lature de&s;igned it; the diffu&s;ion of knowledge and virtue, among our fellow citizens. Your ta&s;k is arduous, your re|&s;pon&s;ibility is great; but the dignity of the object, will not fail to animate the generous heart with re&s;o|lution,
<PB N="26" REF="032062_0026_0FF10A0E0FD10AB0">zeal, and unremitting per&s;everance. With &s;uch an object in view, you have on your &s;ide the good wi&s;hes and ardent prayers of all the virtuous; you have on your &s;ide, the Providence of that God, who is the great Father of Lights, and Conductor of the Univer&s;e. Per&s;evere then with the &s;ame &s;pirited, noble exertions with which you have begun; that Bri&s;tol Academy may, in the diffu&s;ion of literature and morality, be a great and permanent ble&s;&s;ing to the county and community, and hold an honourable rank among the flouri&s;hing Seminaries which adorn and ble&s;s our country.</P>
<P>IMPRESSED with grateful &s;entiments for the at|tention and candour of this large and re&s;pectable au|dience, and convinced of the infinite con&s;equence of education to us all, I cannot but beg leave, in the clo&s;e of our &s;ubject, again to call your atten|tion to it. It is from the want of education, that, notwith&s;tanding the native dignity of human nature, millions of our race are now low &s;unk in barbarity; clothed with the unwrought &s;kins of animals, &s;ub|&s;i&s;ting, as bea&s;ts of prey, by the precarious events of the cha&s;e, covered with little el&s;e than the canopy of heaven, expo&s;ed to all the elements of nature, ho&s;tile, and awfully cruel in their di&s;po&s;itions, ignor|ant of their origin, or de&s;tination, of the one only living and true God, and the Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, wor&s;hiping idols, and living and dying but a little exalted above the bea&s;ts of the fore&s;t. It is from the want of education, and &s;o of a ju&s;t knowledge of the rights of man, that almo&s;t the whole of the human race have, from their fir&s;t creation to the pre|&s;ent
<PB N="27" REF="032062_0027_0FF10A1121D41478">day, been draging out exi&s;tence under the iron &s;ceptres of tyrants and de&s;pots, and bleeding under the cur&s;ed la&s;h of &s;lavery. It is from the want of education, or from an erroneous one, that the pure re|ligion of Je&s;us has been &s;o ba&s;ely maculated, and de|ba&s;ed with &s;uper&s;tition and ab&s;urdity. The kingdom of antichri&s;t was laid in ignorance; and by this the Pope of Rome, for more than a thou&s;and years, &s;way|ed the horrid &s;ceptre of eccle&s;ia&s;tical tyranny, over all the nations of Chri&s;tendom. It is from the want of a right education, that we have the humiliation and great unhappine&s;s, to &s;ee many of our fellow citizens inveloped in darkne&s;s and prejudice; many wretch|ed between the demands of idlene&s;s and poverty; many mo&s;t &s;hockingly deba&s;ed in the corruptions of ob&s;cenity; many, for their outrages on &s;ociety, draging the chain in the horrid dungeon, or &s;u&s;pended on the &s;hameful gallows; many devoted to di&s;&s;ipation, and the gratification of ungovernable appetites and pa&s;&s;ions. In &s;hort, it &s;eems not too much to &s;ay, that almo&s;t all the vices and evils of life may be traced back either to the want of an education, or an erro|neous one.</P>
<P>BUT how refulgent is the contra&s;t of a right education! By this all the dignified faculties of man are improved, and directed towards that exalted &s;tate of perfection and happine&s;s for which the Creator de&s;igned him. By this he becomes con&s;cious of his own dignity, and ri&s;es into &s;elf-&s;atisfaction, and enjoyment. By this he becomes u&s;eful to the world, a crown of glory to his friends, and re&s;pected and loved by all. By this he becomes acquainted with
<PB N="28" REF="032062_0028_0FF10A136ADCC358">the wonderful works of God, which are every where &s;pread around him&mdash;and by this he becomes ac|quainted with our holy religion, is impre&s;&s;ed with its precepts, and directed to heaven. By education nations enjoy all the ble&s;&s;ings of &s;ociety. Agri|culture, manufactures, and commerce, which ble&s;s mankind with all the nece&s;&s;aries and conveniencies of life, are perfected by the all-powerful hand of edu|cation. By this al&s;o the government of a nation is moulded, and its citizens ri&s;e to a knowledge of the rights of man, and the enjoyment of civil liberty. In &s;hort, by this only, a nation is made happy at home, and re&s;pectable abroad.</P>
<P>SUCH then, my friends, being the immen&s;e value of education, let all embark in its cau&s;e. Let government, and able individuals offer their patro|nage and encouragement. Let parents exhau&s;t their tendere&s;t affections in this glorious work. Let teachers realize and carefully di&s;charge the amazing re&s;pon&s;ibility which lies upon them. Let both &s;exes equally &s;hare in tho&s;e exertions; let them be begun early, and no time be lo&s;t. Let youth be impre&s;&s;ed with the value of a good education, and the la|borious attention nece&s;&s;ary to acquire it. Let their exertions be mea&s;ured by the greatne&s;s and value of the work, and the brevity and value of the morn|ing of life, and corre&s;pondent to the anxious wi&s;hes, prayers and exertions of their parents and in&s;truc|tors. As all of us are equally intere&s;ted in the great and common cau&s;e, let us, in heart and hand, unite to advance it, and the ble&s;&s;igns of God will attend us.</P>
