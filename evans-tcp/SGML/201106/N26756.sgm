<HEAD>TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE observations contained in the fol|lowing pages, are solemnly addressed to your conscience and to your judgment. My object is to demonstrate to the people, and to you, that the constitution of the Unit|ed States, has been violated. The argu|ments which are used to effect this demon|stration, are derived from the first and purest principles of political science, and are exhibited in that plain form, which truth alone can centure to assume.</P>
<P>If, Sir, these arguments shall excite in your mind, a doubt concerning the power of Congress, to define and punish libels, my purpose will be accomplished. The virtu|ous servant, of a free people, will not per|form a single act of power, unless be is <HI>ab|&s;olutely
<PB N="2" REF="035605_0004_1005FCFC07032A80">&s;ure,</HI> that be is authorised to per|form it, by that charter whose sacred pre|cepts he has pledged himself to God and to his Country to observe. If, relying too much on the decision of an angry and agitated as|sembly, he has hastily given his assent to a measure, of which his judgment now com|pels him to question the propriety, disdain|ing all considerations, but those of truth and justice, he will come forward with the firmness which belongs to virtue, and ac|knowledge to the world, the real situation of his mind. In doing this, he will exhi|bit to mankind, an instance of rectitude and candor, which it has been seldom if ever their fortune to behold; and by this glorious homage, voluntarily offered to rea|son and to truth, he will promote the cause of liberty and virtue, and render his own name immortal. He will dispel solicitude and sorrow from the bosoms of thousands, whose patriotism is as pure as his own, and still the tumult that is now rising in the country, and which threatens to over|whelm the union with ruin and confusion.</P>
<P>I will not offend you, Sir, by saying that on this subject, you <HI>mu&s;t</HI> entertain <HI>&s;ome doubt.</HI> It is possible that you may be <HI>ab|&s;olutely &s;ure,</HI> that the Congress of the Uni|ted States does possess a power, which certainly is not expressly given, nor can be
<PB N="3" REF="035605_0005_1005FCFD926EF2C8">shewn to be necessary to carry any given power into effect. It is possible, that you may be <HI>ab&s;olutely</HI> sure, that you are in the right, although forty of the representatives of the people, equal at least in talents and integrity, and almost equal in numbers to their opponents, have told you that you are in the wrong. It is possible that you may retain this absolute conviction, in spite of the solemn decision of the respectable legis|latures of Kentucky and Virginia. All this is possible, and if you shall say either by your words or actions, that it is actually the case. I shall not hesitate to believe you; but this belief will be accompanied with won|der, and the most profound regret.</P>
<P>Yet, Sir, however clear your opinion, how|ever decided your conviction may be, on this great constitutional question, there is one point in which we must all agree. It is a truth, which cannot be denied, a truth sup|ported by facts, as notorious as they are alarming, that the sedition bill is in the highest degree dangerous and inexpedient. In this part of the world it is justly regarded as an attack on the liberty of the press, and has roused the attention of the most su|pine. It has inflamed that spirit of suspi|cion and discontent, which, unfortunately for the people, has been already too power|fully excited, and has a direct and obvious
<PB N="4" REF="035605_0006_1005FD0035C048D0">tendency to produce the very crime which it professes to punish. God forbid that I should say, that such was the object for which the law was made. If I entertain|ed an opinion so dishonorable to my country|men, so disgraceful to humanity, my soul would sink with horror and despair. But I cannot despair. Truth, liberty, and virtue, must prevail in America, and I therefore, believe, that the servants of the people, will not continue a law, merely because it has passed, when they know, when they see, that the evil which it has already produced, in|finitely outweighs all the good which they expected to obtain.</P>

<HEAD>AN ESSAY ON THE LIBERTY OF THE PRESS.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">PART I. TO THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES.</HEAD>
<P>IT is the object of the following addre&s;s to demonstrate, that &s;o much of the late act of Congre&s;s, commonly called the Se|dition Bill, as relates to libels, is <HI>not warranted</HI> by the Constitution of the Uni|ted States; and that &s;o much thereof as relates to <HI>printed</HI> libels, is <HI>expressly for|bidden</HI> by it. To the&s;e two points, my ob&s;ervations will be exclu&s;ively confined.</P>
<P>The following principles, it is pre&s;umed, will be conceded. If the reader denies or doubts their truth, he need not proceed.
<PB N="6" REF="035605_0008_1005FD0357E34BA0">The whole argument is founded on a &s;up|po&s;ition that they are true.</P>
<P N="1">I. That all power originally belongs to the people.</P>
<P N="2">II. That the powers of government are powers granted by the people.</P>
<P N="3">III. That the individuals selected from the ma&s;s of the people, to administer the government, po&s;&s;e&s;s no powers, general or &s;pecial, but tho&s;e which are either ex|pre&s;sly delegated or are <HI>necessary</HI> to carry a power expre&s;sly delegated into effect.</P>
<P N="4">IV. That it has frequently happened in the cour&s;e of human affairs, and may again happen, that the individuals thus &s;elected may abu&s;e the power entrusted to them, and may u&s;urp more power than was meant to be entrusted to them.</P>
<P N="5">V. That one abu&s;e does not justify a|nother, and that the u&s;urpations of Con|gre&s;s cannot be vindicated by the en|croachments of the State Legi&s;latures.</P>
<P N="6">VI. That the deci&s;ion of a constitu|tional question, ought not, in any man|ner, to be affected by the conduct of France, or the opinions of Mr. Jeffer&s;on, or any other man, or men, in the world, but &s;hould rest on the immutable princi|ples of rea&s;on and of truth.</P>
<P>It is on the ground of this last postu|late, that no an&s;wer is given to the <HI>argu|ments,</HI>
<PB N="7" REF="035605_0009_1005FD0840ECB1C0">founded on opinions and writings a&s;cribed to Mr. Jeffer&s;on, and to others; and on the &s;ame ground, the aid which might be obtained from the writings and &s;peeches of Publius and other distingui&s;h|ed federalists, in &s;upport of the po&s;ition now meant to be establi&s;hed, is totally rejected. It is the purpo&s;e of the pre&s;ent addre&s;s, not to a&s;certain what <HI>particular</HI> individuals <HI>have</HI> thought, but what <HI>all</HI> men <HI>ought</HI> to think, concerning the pow|ers of the government, and the freedom of the pre&s;s.</P>
<P N="1">1. If all power originally belongs to the people, tho&s;e who exerci&s;e any por|tion of power, must derive their authori|ty from the people, and can po&s;&s;e&s;s no power, that is not given, expre&s;sly, or by fair and nece&s;&s;ary implication. To a&s;certain the preci&s;e portion of power, which they have granted, we must re&s;ort to the instruments or writings by which their intention to grant power is expre&s;&s;|ed. The&s;e instruments are the Constitu|tions of the &s;everal States, formed at a time when they were independent &s;ove|reignties, and the Federal Constitution, which unites all the States.</P>
<P>The State Constitutions preceded by &s;everal years, the formation of the Fede|ral Compact. By the&s;e Constitutions go|vernments
<PB N="8" REF="035605_0010_1005FD0A848ED308">were organized, and the Le|gi&s;latures were intrusted with a <HI>general</HI> power to do what they might think the public good required. This power had been exerci&s;ed in all the States, and the regulations, which it was thought the public good required, had been adopted. The rights of per&s;ons and things, public and private wrongs, which furni&s;h all the materials for local and municipal law, had been accurately defined, and were well understood. <HI>Adequate provision mas made to secure reputation</HI> as well as liberty and life. Still, however, a Federal Govern|ment was deemed e&s;&s;ential, to the peace and happine&s;s of the people of America; not becau&s;e the State institutions were defective and required amendment, not becau&s;e liberty was in danger, or becau&s;e character was not &s;ufficiently guarded from defamation, but becau&s;e there were many important &s;ubjects on which the State Legi&s;latures could not act with ef|fect. They could not make effectual pro|vi&s;ion for paying the public debt, nor re|gulate Commerce, nor borrow money on the credit of the United States, nor esta|bli&s;h a &s;ystem of general defence. The&s;e were the great objects which could not be attained, but by means of a Federal Government, and for the attainment of
<PB N="9" REF="035605_0011_1005FD0C32DB93B8">the&s;e objects a Federal Government was instituted. The powers therefore delega|ted to this government were &s;pecial and limited, and from the state of things could not have been otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>Nothing can be more obvious, and no|thing has been more generally admitted, than the distinction, between the princi|ple which is the ba&s;is of the State go|vernments, and that which forms the ba&s;is of the Federal Constitution. To the State governments, general powers of le|gi&s;lation are granted, and they may legi&s;|late on all &s;ubjects, except tho&s;e on which they are expre&s;sly forbidden to act. To the Federal Government, &s;pecific powers only are given, and Congre&s;s can legi&s;|late on tho&s;e &s;ubjects only on which they are expre&s;sly authori&s;ed to act. The State governments po&s;&s;e&s;s all powers, be|longing to the people, except tho&s;e ex|pre&s;sly withheld: the general govern|ment po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es tho&s;e powers only which are expre&s;sly granted, or are nece&s;&s;ary to carry a power expre&s;sly granted into ef|fect. When therefore a doubt ari&s;es con|cerning the con&s;titutionality of a Con|gre&s;&s;ional law, the fir&s;t que&s;tion ought re|gularly to be, is the power to pa&s;s this law expre&s;sly granted to Congre&s;s? If it be not expre&s;sly granted in plain words
<PB N="10" REF="035605_0012_1005FD0F672E0B68">for that purpo&s;e, the next que&s;tion mu&s;t be&mdash;Is this law nece&s;&s;ary to carry any power expre&s;sly granted into effect? If it be not nece&s;&s;ary, there is an end of all doubt or difficulty on the &s;ubject, and the law is ab&s;olutely void.</P>
<P>Let the Sedition bill be brought to the test of an examination on the&s;e principles, and the re&s;ult will be, that tho&s;e clau&s;es in it, which puni&s;h in&s;urrection or <HI>actual</HI> op|po&s;ition to the authori&s;ed mea&s;ures of go|vernment, will be found warranted by the terms and meaning of the federal compact; becau&s;e the be&s;t laws would be of no avail, unle&s;s Congre&s;s po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a power to pu|ni&s;h tho&s;e who oppo&s;ed their execution. The power of puni&s;hing acts of oppo&s;ition to the laws, therefore, being nece&s;&s;ary, to carry the laws them&s;elves into due opera|tion, is readily conceded to belong to Congre&s;s. But the inquiry pur&s;ued far|ther, on the &s;ame principles, will terminate in a conviction, that &s;o much of the Se|dition Bill as relates to libels on the go|vernment, or the individuals belonging to it, is not within the words or meaning of the Con&s;titution. It will not be &s;aid that the power of puni&s;hing libels is expre&s;sly given. Several offences are enumerated which may be defined and puni&s;hed by the general government; but libels are not in|cluded.
<PB N="11" REF="035605_0013_1005FD10F1D8F4B0">If then the power of puni&s;hing li|bels is not expre&s;sly given, it cannot be ex|erci&s;ed, unle&s;s it can be &s;hewn to be <HI>neces|sary</HI> to carry &s;ome given powers into effect. What is the power expre&s;sly given, which is carried into effect, or is in any &s;hape aided in its operation, by the power of puni&s;hing libels. Plain as this que&s;tion is, it never has been an&s;wered. In fact it can|not be an&s;wered. Gallatin propounded it at the last &s;e&s;&s;ion to the advocates of the Sedition Bill, with his u&s;ual per&s;picuity; but neither the eloquence of Otis, nor the ingenuity of Harper could be brought to encounter it!</P>
<P>One ca&s;e more will completely illu&s;trate the doctrine here inculcated. In 1792 Congre&s;s pa&s;&s;ed a law puni&s;hing with death per&s;ons concerned in robbing the mail, or &s;tealing letters from the po&s;t of|fice. If the enumerated powers of the government be examined, it will be found that the power to pa&s;s &s;uch a law is not expre&s;sly granted&mdash;&s;till however it is war|ranted by the Con&s;titution, becau&s;e it is nece&s;&s;ary to carry into effect the general power expre&s;sly granted to Congre&s;s, to e&s;tabli&s;h po&s;t offices and po&s;t roads.</P>
<P>The po&s;ition, that Congre&s;s can exer|ci&s;e no power that is not given expre&s;sly, or by <HI>necessary</HI> implication, tho' manife&s;t|ly
<PB N="12" REF="035605_0014_1005FD1354CA1138">re&s;ulting from the nature of a federal compact, and &s;upported by every fair and rational con&s;truction of the con&s;titution, has, from exce&s;s of caution, been expre&s;s|ly recognized by the 12th article of the Amendments, which declares, <Q>that powers not delegated to the United States by the Con&s;titution, nor prohi|bited by it to the States, are re&s;erved to the States re&s;pectively or to the peo|ple.</Q></P>
<P>Solid as the foregoing principle is, and &s;olemn as its recognition has been by the people of America, it has been boldly de|nied by &s;ome, and artfully evaded by others. It has been &s;trenuou&s;ly contend|ed, that Congre&s;s had power to adopt all mea&s;ures which they might think condu|cive to the general welfare. Mr. S. from South-Carolina was the fir&s;t who openly proclaimed it as his opinion, that con&s;tituti|onality and expediency were convertible terms.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who advocate this doctrine, en|deavour to vindicate their conduct by re|&s;orting to the preamble, and to the 8th Section of the fir&s;t Article of the Con&s;ti|tution of the United States.</P>
<P>But before the arguments drawn from the&s;e &s;ources are noticed, it is proper to ob&s;erve, that all rea&s;oning on any propo&s;i|tion,
<PB N="13" REF="035605_0015_1005FD14DFEDC460">may be reduced into the form of a &s;yllogi&s;m; and if the first and &s;econd terms be true, and the conclu&s;ion correct|ly stated, the demonstration &s;ought for is obtained; and according to all the rules of logic, and the plain dictates of common &s;en&s;e, principles from which a different conclu&s;ion is deduced, cannot be true.</P>
<P>The propo&s;ition here maintained is, that &s;o much of the Sedition Bill as pre|&s;cribes a puni&s;hment for libels is not war|ranted by the Federal Constitution.</P>
<P>To demon&s;trate this propo&s;ition to be true. I have recour&s;e to the following &s;yllogi&s;m.</P>
<P N="1">1. Congre&s;s po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es no power unle&s;s it be expre&s;sly given, or nece&s;&s;ary to carry a given power into effect. See the 1&s;t, 2d, and 3d postulates.</P>
<P N="2">2. The power of pre&s;cribing a puni&s;h|ment for libels is not expre&s;sly given, nor nece&s;&s;ary to carry a given power into effect.</P>
<P N="3">3. Conclu&s;ion. Therefore &s;o much of the Sedition Bill as pre&s;cribes a puni&s;h|ment for libels, is not warranted by the Federal Con&s;titution.</P>
<P>Upon principles of fair and logical rea|&s;oning, tho&s;e who advocate the con&s;tituti|onality of the Sedition Bill, mu&s;t admit the conclu&s;ion here &s;tated, unle&s;s they controvert the truth of the fir&s;t or &s;econd terms of the foregoing &s;yllogi&s;m.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="035605_0016_1005FD18EA6A9CB0">
The truth of the first term is controver|ted by &s;ome on the ground of the pream|ble to the Constitution&mdash;the words are, <Q>We the people of the United States, <HI>in order</HI> to form a more perfect union, establi&s;h justice, in&s;ure domestic tran|quillity, provide for the common de|fence, promote the general welfare, and &s;ecure the ble&s;&s;ings of Liberty to our|&s;elves and our posterity, <HI>do ordain and establish this Constitution,</HI> for the Uni|ted States of America.</Q></P>
<P>From the language of this preamble, it has been contended, that Congre&s;s have a power, expre&s;sly granted, to pa&s;s any laws which in their opinion may tend to pro|vide for the common defence, or promote the general welfare.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Sewall's Speech on the Sedition Bill.</NOTE></P>
<P>The &s;ame inference has been drawn from the 8th Section of the 1st article of the Constitution, which declares, <Q>that Congre&s;s &s;hall have power to lay and coHect taxes, duties, exci&s;es, and im|posts to pay the debts and provide for the common defence and general wel|fare of the United States.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Otis and Bayard's Speeches on the Alien Bill.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>Arguments are &s;ometimes brought for|ward in di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, the refutation of which requires more patience than &s;kill&mdash;of this de&s;cription is the argument now stated.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="035605_0017_1005FD1A7452AF10">
As to the Preamble. The &s;pecial reply to this argument is, that the preamble to a statute or constitution, which is the &s;upreme statute, is no part of it. This is not mentioned as a principle of common law, but as a principle of common &s;en&s;e; a preamble states the general objects of the law of the constitution, and the arti|cles which follow pre&s;cribe the means by which, and by which only, the attainment of the&s;e objects is to be pur&s;ued; the preamble can neither enlarge nor restrain the body of the act; it is in fact, nothing more than a declaration of objects; the constitution or law, is a &s;pecification of means. The preamble to the Constitution therefore &s;ays, in &s;ubstance, <Q>We the people of the United States in order to promote the general welfare, <HI>do ordain this</HI> Constitution:</Q>&mdash;that is, <Q>we do ordain this Constitution, in order to promote the general welfare.</Q> Lan|guage cannot be more plain. The Con|stitution is unequivocally announced as the instrument or mean by which the ge|neral welfare is to be promoted.</P>
<P>As to the 8th Section of the 1st article. The &s;pecial reply to the argument founded on this &s;ection is, that the plain, gram|matical meaning of the &s;entence, even ta|ken by it&s;elf, and without any reference
<PB N="16" REF="035605_0018_1005FD1D036C4C08">to the uniform tenor of the Constitution, forbids the inference before mentioned. The Constitution by the words of this Section, meant to give not a general pow|er to provide for the general good of the union, but the &s;pecial power of laying and collecting taxes and duties, <HI>for the pur|pose</HI> of paying the debts and providing for the general welfare. According to this construction, a &s;pecial power is given for a general purpo&s;e, in other words for the general good, which is in truth the pur|po&s;e for which all power is granted; but according to the construction contended for by the advocates of the Sedition Bill, the &s;ame &s;entence which gives a &s;pecial power, al&s;o gives a general power, which renders the &s;pecial delegation of power u&s;ele&s;s. Which of the&s;e two construc|tions is the most rational, is a question that is not &s;uppo&s;ed to be in the &s;mallest degree doubtful.</P>
<P>It &s;eems clear then that a fair construc|tion of the preamble, and of the 8th &s;ec|tion of that article, con&s;idered in them|&s;elves, does not warrant the doctrine maintained by the friends of the Sedition Bill, that Congre&s;s po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a general power to provide for the welfare of the Union. This doctrine appears not only not warranted by the particular clau&s;es
<PB N="17" REF="035605_0019_1005FD207812E390">relied on, but ab&s;urd, when the&s;e clau&s;es are taken into view with all the other clau&s;es of the Constitution.</P>
<P>It has been already &s;tated, that in each of the &s;everal &s;tates, the local and muni|cipal regulations which were thought ex|pedient had been adopted. With the&s;e the people were &s;atisfied. When, there|fore, a federal government was deemed <HI>necessary</HI> by the people, it would not be their intention or wi&s;h that the federal government &s;hould make laws on any &s;ub|ject, on which &s;atisfactory laws were al|ready made, or might be made, at the di&s;|cretion of their repre&s;entatives. A federal con&s;titution <HI>could not be necessary</HI> for any purpo&s;e completely within the reach of &s;tate legi&s;lation: and, therefore, general powers could not be intended to be gi|ven.</P>
<P>It is a &s;ound principle, that all parts of a law or writing are to be taken together, and that &s;uch a con&s;truction ought to be adopted, if po&s;&s;ible, as will allow every part &s;ome meaning and operation. Now, if the preamble, or the 8th &s;ec. of the 1&s;t article, confers on Congre&s;s a general power to do what they may think right; tho&s;e parts of the con&s;titution which dele|gate &s;pecial powers are unmeaning and without operation. On the other hand, if
<PB N="18" REF="035605_0020_1005FD22D2C22790">the preamble be regarded in its true light; as a declaration of objects; and if the 8th Section of the 1&s;t article be con&s;idered as only giving a &s;pecial power for a general purpo&s;e, every other clau&s;e and &s;entence of the con&s;titution, will have a meaning and effect. This latter con&s;truction, there|fore, <HI>must</HI> be adopted.</P>
<P>Again, if Congre&s;s po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a general power to promote the general welfare, if con&s;titutionality and expediency be con|vertible terms, what meaning is to be given to the 12th amendment, which de|clares, that "powers not delegated to the United States, nor prohibited to the &s;tates, &s;hall remain with the &s;tates re&s;pectively, or with the people." This language is &s;o irrational and ab&s;urd, unle&s;s there are &s;ome powers which are not delegated, that it a&s;&s;ords <HI>conclusive</HI> evidence, of an uni|ver&s;al conviction, throughout the &s;tates, and in Congre&s;s, that this <HI>general power</HI> did not exi&s;t.</P>
<P>Further, if it was really meant that a general power &s;hould be given to Con|gre&s;s, why were &s;pecific powers enume|rated and granted? This enumeration is made with a degree of accuracy and pre|cision, ab&s;olutely ridiculous, if a general power was meant to be given. Surely, if &s;uch had been the object, plain words,
<PB N="19" REF="035605_0021_1005EC0754ADABB0">which men of the plaine&s;t capacity might comprehend, and about which there could be no doubt, might have been, and would have been &s;elected for the purpo&s;e. Sure|ly, if &s;uch had been the object, men of common hone&s;ty, and common under&s;tand|ing, after expre&s;&s;ing in plain words what their object was, would not have employ|ed them&s;elves in &s;o idle and u&s;ele&s;s a talk as the enumeration of &s;pecial powers, but would have proceeded directly to mark out the different departments of go|vernment, and to decide among the&s;e de|partments the general powers meant to be be&s;towed.</P>
<P>Again, we have &s;een that the &s;tate go|vernments po&s;&s;e&s;s general powers of legi&s;|lation. They may do every thing which tends to promote the welfare of the re|&s;pective &s;tates, unle&s;s expre&s;sly prohibited by the &s;tate or federal con&s;titutions. Now, if Congre&s;s po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es general powers of legi&s;lation al&s;o, over the people of the United States, it is manife&s;t that we have a government within a government, one of which mu&s;t inevitably peri&s;h. Argu|ments leading to a conclu&s;ion &s;o mon&s;trous <HI>must</HI> be erroneous.</P>
<P>This last ob&s;ervation may be complete|ly illu&s;trated by the law in que&s;tion. The &s;tate governments have yet a right to pre|&s;cribe
<PB N="20" REF="035605_0022_1005FD27045A1320">a puni&s;hment for &s;lander, which ef|fects the reputation of individuals, whe|ther this &s;lander be by &s;peech, writing, or printing. Before the federal government was formed they po&s;&s;e&s;sed this power, and mu&s;t yet retain it, unle&s;s it has been &s;ur|rendered. No man, however, has yet &s;aid nor can it be &s;aid, that this power may not be legally and con&s;titutionally exer|ci&s;ed by the &s;tates. Suppo&s;e then that the legi&s;lature of Penn&s;ylvania &s;hould pa&s;s a law, pre&s;cribing a fine of fifty dollars only, without any impri&s;onment, for defaming any individual by means of the pre&s;s. The officers of the general government are no|thing more or le&s;s than individuals, and are bound by the general expre&s;&s;ion of a law as well as other people. By what law would a libeller of the Pre&s;ident be tried? By the &s;tate law, by the congre&s;&s;ional law, or by both? This que&s;tion, difficult as it is, mu&s;t be an&s;wered by tho&s;e who advo|cate the general power of the govern|ment of the United States, without con|troverting the general powers of the &s;tate legi&s;latures. This, however, never hav|ing yet been done, it is pre&s;umed will not be done.</P>
<P>Finally, no po&s;ition can be true from which error or ab&s;urdity can be fairly de|duced. If Congre&s;s po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a general
<PB N="21" REF="035605_0023_1005FD2A2461F700">power to promote the welfare of the union, there is no limitation to this power, but their own di&s;cretion. They may exer|ci&s;e, like the &s;tate governments, every pow|er except tho&s;e which they are expre&s;sly forbidden to exerci&s;e. They are forbid|den to grant titles of nobility, but they are <HI>not</HI> forbidden to pa&s;s laws by which a powerful ari&s;tocracy might be created. They might pa&s;s a law e&s;tabli&s;hing in A|merica the &s;y&s;tem of intails, by which the ari&s;tocracy of Britain, in &s;pite of o&s;tenta|tion, luxury, and profu&s;ion, has been main|tained for &s;o many ages. But bold as the &s;pirit of u&s;urpation may be, this doctrine has never yet been explicitly avowed. It is believed to be too ab&s;urd, ever to be explicitly avowed; and yet it mu&s;t be avowed, or at lea&s;t admitted, by tho&s;e who advocate the general power of the govern|ment of the United States.</P>
<P>But others more artful, though not more formidable, contend, that it is a principle of obvious policy and common &s;en&s;e, that every government &s;hould have within it|&s;elf the means of &s;elf pre&s;ervation; that the power of puni&s;hing libels on the go|vernment: and its officers is e&s;&s;ential to the pre&s;ervation of the government, and that therefore the general government po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the power of puni&s;hing libels.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="035605_0024_1005FD2C759A1B60">
This argument is exhibited in its be&s;t form, but when examined, it cannot mis|lead. The fir&s;t branch of the propo&s;ition is neither admitted, nor denied to be true. It is contended to be immaterial and un|connected with the &s;ubject in debate. The que&s;tion is not, what powers ought a go|vernment to po&s;&s;e&s;s, but what powers does the government now exi&s;ting po&s;&s;e&s;s? The fir&s;t que&s;tion was determined by the Convention in 1788, and the Congre&s;s in 1789, the la&s;t is to be determined by the people now. The fir&s;t que&s;tion ari&s;es, when a con&s;titution is about to be form|ed, the latter, after it is formed. This part of the propo&s;ition, therefore, being immaterial, the rea&s;oning founded on it cannot be conclu&s;ive. What, in truth, can be more repugnant to all the rules of logic, than the attempt to prove that a power <HI>has been</HI> granted, by arguments to &s;hew that <HI>it ought to have been</HI> granted.</P>
<P>When the fir&s;t term of any regular ar|gument is proved to be untrue, or &s;hewn to be immaterial, it is neither nece&s;&s;ary nor proper to controvert the &s;econd, be|cau&s;e, whether right or wrong, the con|clu&s;ion if correctly deduced, mu&s;t be un|true or immaterial. I will not, therefore, deviate at this time, from the plan of &s;trict di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, which is announced in the
<PB N="23" REF="035605_0025_1005FD2E043A0FD0">fir&s;t paragraph, to prove, that the power of puni&s;hing libels, <HI>however important to the men of government,</HI> is of no con&s;e|quence to the government it&s;elf.</P>
<P>There remains only one more argu|ment in favor of the &s;edition bill. This is noticed here, not becau&s;e it is worthy of notice, but becau&s;e it affords a complete &s;pecimen of the <HI>acute and logical reasoning,</HI> by which this odious mea&s;ure has been vin|dicated. It is conceded, &s;ays Mr. Otis, that government has a right to puni&s;h &s;edition or in&s;urrection: it therefore has a right to puni&s;h every thing which may <HI>lead</HI> to &s;edition or in&s;urrection.</P>
<P>The force of this argument may be de|&s;troyed by exhibiting it in a regular form, and applying it to the &s;ubject on which it was urged.</P>
<P N="1">1. Congre&s;s has a right to puni&s;h &s;edi|tion and in&s;urrection. This is conceded to be true.</P>
<P N="2">2. Libels <HI>lead</HI> to &s;edition and in&s;urrec|tion. Now this is not true; nor does Mr. Otis attempt to prove it to be true. But, whether true or not, it is immaterial. The affirmation here ought to be, not li|bels <HI>lead</HI> to, but "libels are <HI>acts</HI> of &s;edi|tion, or in&s;urrection" and then the con|clu&s;ion would re-gularly follow.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="24" REF="035605_0026_1005FD2F954D56B0">
3. That Congre&s;s has a right to puni&s;h libels. But neither Mr. Otis nor any other man will &s;ay, that any libel is an act of &s;edition or in&s;urrection, or even a breach of the peace.</P>
<P>It de&s;erves farther to be remarked here, that the power of puni&s;hing &s;edition is not expre&s;sly given to Congre&s;s: it is ad|mitted, however, to belong to Congre&s;s, becau&s;e it is <HI>necessary</HI> to carry the laws them&s;elves pa&s;&s;ed, in conformity to the con&s;titution, into effect. The power of puni&s;hing libels, not being given, can be claimed like the power of puni&s;hing &s;edi|tion, only on the ground of nece&s;&s;ity; This carries us back to the question for|merly put, what power expre&s;sly given to Congre&s;s is ever <HI>aided</HI> by the power of pu|ni&s;hing libels?</P>
<P>According to Mr. Otis if a government has a power to puni&s;h one offence, it has of cour&s;e a right to puni&s;h all acts which may lead to that offence. In other words, if it has a power to puni&s;h one offence, it has of cour&s;e a power to puni&s;h twenty offences, however different in name and na|ture. Under this &s;ystem of rea&s;oning, if the general government was authori&s;ed to puni&s;h the murder of a man in the &s;ervice of the United States, it would have of cour&s;e a right to puni&s;h an in&s;ult, becau&s;e
<PB N="25" REF="035605_0027_1005FD32B02F53C0">in&s;ults lead to quarrels, and quarrels lead to murder. Various other ca&s;es might be put which would expo&s;e the fallacy of rea&s;oning like this; but it is already &s;uf|ficiently expo&s;ed. The argument which implies the power of puni&s;hing libels, from the power of puni&s;hing &s;edition, which is in it&s;elf only an <HI>implied</HI> power, must be condemned as &s;oon as it is understood, even if it could be &s;hewn that libels do lead to &s;edition. But they do not lead to it. This negative po&s;ition, it is not ne|ce&s;&s;ary now to prove, the contrary being affirmed by Mr. OTIS ought to be proved by him.</P>
<P>It was before mentioned, that there was an univer&s;al conviction in the United States, that general powers of legi&s;lation did not belong to Congre&s;s. The 12th amendment was offered as conclu&s;ive evi|dence of the truth of this a&s;&s;ertion. If then the people of the United States re|ally &s;uppo&s;ed that Congre&s;s po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed only the powers delegated, expre&s;sly, or by fair and nece&s;&s;ary construction, and it turns out that Congre&s;s po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a power never meant to be bestowed, in con&s;equence of certain general expre&s;&s;ions, the force of which was not accurately estimated, what man, who pretends either to integrity or
<PB N="26" REF="035605_0028_1005FD35C9101950">republicani&s;m, will dare to &s;ay that he will carry &s;uch a power into effect?</P>
<P>The principle on which &s;o much of the &s;edition bill as pre&s;cribes a puni&s;hment for libels, is declared to be unconstitution|al, having been it is believed, clearly ex|plained and establi&s;hed, and the principle on which the advocates of that mea&s;ure rely, having been &s;hewn to be un&s;ound in it&s;elf and ab&s;urd in its con&s;equences; the first part of my undertaking ought to be con&s;idered as performed. But many ob|&s;ervations have been made concerning the common law of England, and the force which it has in the United States, &s;ome notice ought to be taken of them here.</P>
<P>It has been alledged by &s;ome, that the common law of England is in force in the United States, and that libels are an of|tence at common law, and were puni&s;h|able even before the Sedition Bill. Judge Peters it is &s;aid committed Mr. Bache, the late Editor of the Aurora, on this ground.</P>
<P>Before this doctrine is examined, there is one remark which de&s;erves attention. A legi&s;lative act has been performed: it is ur|ged, that this act is not warranted by the Con&s;titution of the United States. The friends of the mea&s;ure &s;ay that it is con|&s;titutional, and to prove their a&s;&s;ertion
<PB N="27" REF="035605_0029_1005FD3753DCCB08">they refer you not to the con&s;titution it|&s;elf, by which alone power, general or &s;pe|cial, can be claimed, but to the common law of England!!</P>
<P>To prove that Congre&s;s has a right to pa&s;s a law to puni&s;h libels, they &s;ay that there already exi&s;ts a law in the country, by which libels may be puni&s;hed! The &s;y&s;tem of moderation, which was adopted at the commencement of the&s;e papers, and from which there has been as yet no de|viation, prevents me from &s;peaking of ar|guments like the&s;e in the terms which they de&s;erve.</P>
<P>If the common law of England be in force in the United States, it mu&s;t be in force becau&s;e it is declared to be &s;o by the con&s;titution, or by &s;ome law of the Uni|ted States&mdash;no <HI>municipal</HI> &s;y&s;tem of law can, be of any authority here, unle&s;s ex|pre&s;sly adopted in one of the&s;e two ways. The con&s;titution is &s;ilent on the &s;ubject&mdash; this &s;ilence was wi&s;e; becau&s;e, a &s;y&s;tem of law adopted by the con&s;titution could not be changed by any act of ordinary le|gi&s;lation; nor is it adopted by any law of the United States; and if it had been &s;o adopted, the que&s;tion would be preci&s;ely the &s;ame that is now di&s;cu&s;&s;ed. For if Congre&s;s have no right to pa&s;s a law pu|ni&s;hing libels, it follows that they have
<PB N="28" REF="035605_0030_1005FD39DC272358">no right to adopt a &s;y&s;tem of laws, one of which, pre&s;cribes a puni&s;hment for libels.</P>
<P>I repeat that no law can be in force here, unle&s;s adopted in one of the two ways ju&s;t mentioned. Law is a rule of action pre&s;cribed by the &s;upreme power of a &s;tate. The &s;upreme power of the United States has not declared the com|mon law of England to be in force here: therefore, it is not in force here. It will be ob&s;erved, that I &s;peak not here of the law of nations.</P>
<P>If there be a pa&s;&s;age through which the municipal regulations of one country, can get into another country, and acquire anthority in it, without the expre&s;s con|&s;ent of the people, tho&s;e who have an|nounced the migration of the common law of England into the United States will inform the public, whether it was ac|companied in its voyage by the civil law or not. If this <HI>singular</HI> inva&s;ion of our country is not firmly repelled, we may expect depredations on our &s;tate in&s;titu|tions from all the codes of the ea&s;tern world. The compendious and energetic &s;y&s;tem by which the Sultaun keeps his &s;laves in peace, may at this moment be on its way to America, and on its arrival here will be preci&s;ely of as much force as the common law of England.</P>

<P>Again, if the common law of England be in force in the United States, and is to be the guide by which the federal judges &s;hall conduct them&s;elves, what becomes of the various changes in the common law which have been effected at different times by the &s;everal &s;tate legi&s;latures? are the improvements on the common law, which have been made in the &s;tate of Virginia, for the accommodation and convenience of the people, to be entirely done away without their knowledge or con&s;ent? Is the right of primogeniture revived? Or, is it only the criminal law that is in force here? The&s;e are two im|portant
<PB N="30" REF="035605_0032_1005FD3E66299F70">points, among a thou&s;and others, on which information is required from the advocates of the common law.</P>
<P>The Congre&s;s of the United States, &s;o far from adopting the common law of England, which, it mu&s;t be again ob&s;erv|ed, they had not a general power to adopt, have expre&s;sly enacted that the laws of the &s;everal &s;tates, except where the con&s;titu|tion, treaties, or &s;tatutes of the United States, &s;hall otherwi&s;e require or provide, &s;hall be regarded as rules of deci&s;ion in trials of common law in the courts of the United States in ca&s;es where they apply. See Act pa&s;&s;ed 24th Sept. 1789.</P>
<P>On this &s;ubject, there is one argument, which in it&s;elf is ab&s;olutely conclu&s;ive. The Congre&s;s of the United States have a power to pa&s;s a law concerning libels or not. If they have this power, and exer|ci&s;e it, by pre&s;cribing a puni&s;hment for li|bels, the courts of the United States mu&s;t be governed by the law of the United States, and cannot exerci&s;e any common law juri&s;diction on the &s;ubject. But if Congre&s;s does not po&s;&s;e&s;s the right to pa&s;s a law concerning libels, then the argu|ments which &s;hew that the courts of the United States have a juri&s;diction over li|bels, al&s;o &s;hew that their juri&s;diction ex|tends to &s;ubjects, on which Congre&s;s can|not
<PB N="31" REF="035605_0033_1005FD40B0E39830">legi&s;late. Thus the power of the ju|diciary will embrace objects beyond the reach of the legi&s;lature, and of cour&s;e the laws by which the judiciary think proper to be governed, mu&s;t remain forever un|changed. Surely it will be at once admit|ted, that every argument who&s;e object is to prove, that the judiciary power is not co-exten&s;ive with the legi&s;lative power, but <HI>more</HI> exten&s;ive, mu&s;t be un&s;ound.</P>
<P>This admi&s;&s;ion will be made without he&s;itation, by every one who under&s;tands either the general principles of govern|ment, or the plain meaning of our own con&s;titution, which &s;ays, Art. 3, Sect. 2. "The judicial power of the United States &s;hall extend to all ca&s;es in law and equity ari&s;ing under this constitution, the laws of the United States, and treaties made, or which &s;hall be made under their autho|rity." The&s;e are the great &s;ubjects on which the judicial power of the United States is to be exerci&s;ed according to the expre&s;s direction of the Constitution. The other ca&s;es to which their authority is declared to extend, are totally uncon|nected with common law juri&s;diction.</P>
<P>But, it is &s;aid, the &s;ame clau&s;e declares, that the judicial power of the United States &s;hall extend to <Q>controver&s;ies to which the United States &s;hall be a par|ty.</Q>
<PB N="32" REF="035605_0034_1005FD4240F456C8">From this &s;ome have inferred, that the federal judiciary have juri&s;diction over every offence again&s;t the United States, becau&s;e the United States consti|tute the party injured.</P>
<P>It has been already &s;hewn, that the com|mon law is of no force in the United States; now if the courts claim a juri&s;|diction over every <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word">, in which they may think that the United States are a party, by what law will they define and puni&s;h the offence?

<P>IT is the object of the following ob&s;er|vations, to demonstrate, that &s;o much of the &s;edition bill, as relates to <HI>printed</HI> libels, is expre&s;sly forbidden by the con&s;titution of the United States. This que&s;tion, in &s;trictne&s;s, ought not to be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed; be|cau&s;e, if Congre&s;s have not power given, either expre&s;sly, or by nece&s;&s;ary <HI>implica|tion,</HI> to pa&s;s the law under con&s;ideration, it is totally immaterial whether they are forbidden to pa&s;s it or not. But as the "freedom of the pre&s;s," has never yet been accurately defined, and as there is no &s;ubject in which the welfare of &s;ociety is more e&s;&s;entially concerned, my original undertaking &s;hall be fully performed.</P>
<P>The words of the con&s;titution, which contains the expre&s;s prohibition here re|lied
<PB N="34" REF="035605_0036_1005FD4974B7ED08">on, are, "Congre&s;s &s;hall make no law abridging the freedom of &s;peech or of the pre&s;s." See the third article of the amend|ments, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Before any preci&s;e con&s;truction is put on the&s;e words, "freedom of the pre&s;s," an argument in favor of the foregoing propo&s;itions pre&s;ents it&s;elf, which to me feems conclu&s;ive.</P>
<P>The federal government had been or|gani&s;ed, and its operation had commenced, &s;ome time before the third article of the amendment became a part of the con&s;ti|tution. During this period, the pre&s;s <HI>was free,</HI> from any control. It is a fact, that no law was pa&s;&s;ed by Congre&s;s to con|trol it. It is a truth already proved, that no law could be pa&s;&s;ed by Congre&s;s to con|trol it; and it is al&s;o a truth, already proved, that there neither was nor could be any <HI>other</HI> law, by which it could be con|trolled. Before th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="2 letters"> amendment. was adopted, therefore, the pre&s;s was free.&mdash; The mea&s;ures of the government were &s;ubjects of general di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, and were &s;tated, &s;ometimes truly, &s;ometimes fal&s;ely, at the di&s;cretion of the printer. Nothing that was &s;aid, however fal&s;e, however &s;candalous, could be noticed by the go|vernment. In this &s;tate of things, a clau&s;e is added to the con&s;titution, which de|clares
<PB N="35" REF="035605_0037_1005FD4B04B67390">that the freedom of the pre&s;s &s;hall not be abridged. In other words, the pre&s;s &s;hall continue to enjoy that total ex|emption from legi&s;lative control, which at this moment it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es. The law, there|fore, which abridges this exemption, is ex|pre&s;sly forbidden.</P>
<P>The &s;ubject before us, hath furni&s;hed the materials for much di&s;cu&s;&s;ion; and it has been &s;o often &s;aid to be impo&s;&s;ible to draw the line between the freedom and licentiou&s;ne&s;s of the pre&s;s, that the at|tempt has never been made. The legal and political writers in England contend, however, that this line mu&s;t be drawn; but, they admit, that the exact degree of longitude has not yet been di&s;covered.</P>
<P>This uncertainty in the law is well adapted to the situation of the Briti&s;h go|vernment. It enables the mini&s;ter to act and puni&s;h as times and circum&s;tances re|quire; without &s;ubjecting him&s;elf to the odium of having tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed the law. But, however important this uncertainty may be in a country, where privilege and monopoly form the ba&s;is of the govern|ment, in the United States it is di&s;grace|ful. In a republican government the peo|ple ought to know, the people have a right to know, the exact, the preci&s;e ex|tent
<PB N="36" REF="035605_0038_1005FD4CAFD6CF98">of every law, by which any indivi|dual may be called before a court of ju&s;|tice.</P>
<P>Fortunately for the people of the U|nited States, the que&s;tion which has per|plexed the politicians and lawyers of Eng|land, does not exi&s;t here. The con&s;titu|tion having declared, that the freedom of the pre&s;s &s;hall not be abridged, has, in fact, pronounced that no line of di&s;crimination &s;hall be drawn. For, if the freedom of the pre&s;s is not to be abridged, and if no man can tell where freedom &s;tops, and li|centiou&s;ne&s;s begins, it is obvious that no man can &s;ay, to what extent a law again&s;t licentiou&s;ne&s;s &s;hall be carried. It fol|lows, then, that <HI>no law can</HI> be made to re&s;train the licentiou&s;ne&s;s of the pre&s;s.</P>
<P>The words, "freedom of the pre&s;s," like most other words, have a meaning, a clear, preci&s;e, and definite meaning, which the times require, &s;hould be unequivocally a&s;certained. That this has not been done before, is a wonderful and melancholy evi|dence of the imbecility of the human mind, and of the &s;low progre&s;s which it makes, in acquiring knowledge even on &s;ubjects the most u&s;eful and intere&s;ting.</P>
<P>It will, I pre&s;ume, be admitted, not on|ly that the words in que&s;tion have a mean|ing; but that the framers of the amend|ment
<PB N="37" REF="035605_0039_1005FD4E637D8E58">containing the&s;e words, meant &s;ome|thing when they declared, that the free|dom of the pre&s;s &s;hould not be abridged.</P>
<P>To a&s;certain what the "freedom of the pre&s;s" is, we have only to a&s;certain what freedom it&s;elf is. For, &s;urely, it will be conceded, that freedom applied to one &s;ubject, means the &s;ame, as freedom ap|plied to another &s;ubject.</P>
<P>Now freedom is of two kinds, and of two kinds only: one is, that ab&s;olute freedom which belongs to man, previous to any &s;ocial in&s;titution; and the other, that qualified or abridged freedom, which he is content to enjoy, for the &s;ake of go|vernment and &s;ociety. I believe there is no other &s;ort of freedom in which man is concerned.</P>
<P>The ab&s;olute freedom then, or what is the &s;ame thing, the freedom, belonging to man, before any &s;ocial compact, is the power, uncontrolled by law, of doing what be plea&s;es, provided he does no injury to any other individual. If this definition of freedom be applied to the pre&s;s, as &s;urely it ought to be, the pre&s;s, if I may per&s;on|ify it, may do whatever it plea&s;es to do, uncontrolled by any law, taking care how|ever, to do no injury to any individual. This injury can only be by &s;lander or de|famation,
<PB N="38" REF="035605_0040_1005FD523B4FCAC8">and reparation &s;hould be made for it in a &s;tate of nature, as well as in &s;o|ciety.</P>
<P>But freedom in &s;ociety, or what is call|ed civil liberty, is defined to be, natural liberty, and &s;o far re&s;trained by law as the public good requires, and no farther. This is the definition given by a writer, parti|cularly di&s;tingui&s;hed for the accuracy of his definitions, and which perhaps cannot be mended. Now let freedom, under the de|finition, be applied to the pre&s;s, and what will the freedom of the pre&s;s amount to? It will amount preci&s;ely to the privilege of publi&s;hing, as far as the legi&s;lative power &s;hall &s;ay, the public good requires: that is to &s;ay, the freedom of the pre&s;s will be regulated by law, in the &s;ame manner as freedom on other &s;ubjects is to be regulated by law. If the word free|dom was u&s;ed in this &s;en&s;e, by the fram|ers of the amendment, they meant to &s;ay, Congre&s;s &s;hall make no law abridging the freedom of the pre&s;s, which freedom, how|ever, is to be regulated by law. Folly it&s;elf does not &s;peak &s;uch language.</P>
<P>It has been admitted by the reader, who has advanced thus far, that the fra|mers of the amendment meant &s;omething. They knew, no doubt, that the powers granted to Congre&s;s, did not authorize
<PB N="39" REF="035605_0041_1005FD54B58460E0">any control over the pre&s;s, but they know that its freedom could not be too cauti|ou&s;ly guarded from inva&s;ion. The amend|ment in que&s;tion was therefore introdu|ced. Now if they u&s;ed the freedom un|der the fir&s;t definition, they did mean &s;omething, and &s;omething of infinite im|portance in all free countries, the total exemption of the pre&s;s from any kind of legi&s;lative control. But if they u&s;ed the word freedom, under the &s;econd definition, they meant nothing, or non&s;en&s;e, which is wor&s;e than nothing; for if they &s;up|po&s;ed that the freedom of the pre&s;s, was ab&s;olute freedom, &s;o far restrained by law as the public good required, and no far|ther, the amendment left the legi&s;lative power of the government on this &s;ubject, preci&s;ely where it was before. But it has been already admitted that the amend|ment had a meaning: the con&s;truction therefore which allows it no meaning is ab&s;urd, and must be rejected.</P>
<P>This argument may be &s;ummed up in a few words. The word "freedom" has a meaning. It is either ab&s;olute, that is, exempt from all law, or it is qualified, that is regulated by law. If it be ex|empt from the control of law, the Sedi|tion Bill which controls the "freedom" of the pre&s;s, is uncon&s;titutional. But if
<PB N="40" REF="035605_0042_1005FD565DE80D38">it be regulated by law, the amendment which declares that Congre&s;s &s;hall make no law to abridge the freedom of the pre&s;s, which freedom however may be re|gulated by law, is the gro&s;&s;e&s;t ab&s;urdity, that ever was conceived by the human mind.</P>
<P>That by the words "freedom of the pre&s;s" is meant a total exemption of the pre&s;s from legi&s;lative control, will further appear, from the following ca&s;es, in which it is manife&s;t, that the word freedom is u&s;ed with this &s;ignification and no other.</P>
<P>It is obvious in it&s;elf, and it is admit|ted by all men, that freedom of &s;peech, means the power uncontrolled by law, of &s;peaking either truth or fal&s;ehood at the di&s;cretion of the individual, provided no other <HI>individual</HI> be injured. This power is, <HI>as yet,</HI> in its full extent in the United States. A man may &s;ay every thing which his pa&s;&s;ion can &s;ugge&s;t, he may em|ploy all his time and all his talents, if he is wicked enough to do &s;o, in <HI>speaking</HI> again&s;t the government matters that are &s;al&s;e, &s;candalous, and malicious, but he is admitted by the majority of Congre&s;s to be &s;heltered by the article in que&s;tion, which forbids a law abridging the freedom of &s;peech. If then freedom of &s;peech means, in the con&s;truction of the con&s;titution,
<PB N="41" REF="035605_0043_1005FD590D899F38">the privilege of &s;peaking <HI>any thing</HI> with|out control, the words freedom of the pre&s;s, which form a part of the &s;ame &s;en|tence, mean the privilege of printing <HI>any thing</HI> without control.</P>
<P>Happily for mankind, the word "free|dom" begins now to be applied to religi|on al&s;o. In the United States it is ap|plied in its fulle&s;t force, and religious freedom is completely under&s;tood to mean the power uncontrolled by law of profe&s;|&s;ing and publi&s;hing any opinions on reli|gious topics, which any individual may choo&s;e to profe&s;s or publi&s;h, and of &s;up|porting tho&s;e opinions by any &s;tatements he may think proper to make. The fool may not only &s;ay in his heart, there is no God, but he may announce if he plea&s;es his athei&s;m to the world. He may en|deavor to corrupt mankind, not only by opinions that are erroneous, but by facts which are fal&s;e. Sill however he will be &s;afe, becau&s;e he lives in a country where religious freedom is e&s;tabli&s;hed. If then freedom of religion, will not permit a man to be puni&s;hed, for publi&s;hing any opini|ons on religious topics, and &s;upporting tho&s;e opinions by fal&s;e facts, &s;urely free|dom of the pre&s;s, which is the medium of all publications, will not permit a man to be puni&s;hed, for publi&s;hing any opinion on
<PB N="42" REF="035605_0044_1005FD5B6FC0F9C0">any &s;ubject, and &s;upporting it by any opi|nion whatever.</P>
<P>Again, the 6th Section of the 1&s;t article of the Con&s;titution of the United States declares, that the members of the Senate and Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives, &s;hall not be que&s;tioned, in any other place, for any &s;peech or debate in either hou&s;e. The object of this clau&s;e is, manife&s;tly, to &s;e|cure to the members, freedom of &s;peech and debate. Of this there can be no doubt. But how is this freedom &s;ecured? It is &s;ecured, in the only way, in which perfect &s;ecurity can be given, and that is by a total exemption from the control of any law, or the jurisdiction of any court. Thus the meaning of the word freedom, is preci&s;ely and unequivocally e&s;tabli&s;hed by the con&s;titution it&s;elf.</P>
<P>The power which each hou&s;e has over its own members affords no argument again&s;t the inference deduced from the foregoing &s;ection of the con&s;titution. The power of puni&s;hing, and expelling a mem|ber, is only to be exerci&s;ed, in ca&s;e of "di&s;orderly behaviour."</P>
<P>The word freedom when applied to de|bate is under&s;tood preci&s;ely in the &s;ame way in the Briti&s;h parliament. Fox, She|ridan, and Grey indulge them&s;elves con|&s;tantly in the Hou&s;e of Commons, in the
<PB N="43" REF="035605_0045_1005FD5DD2178FB0">u&s;e of expre&s;&s;ions, concerning the govern|ment, much more violent than tho&s;e for which private per&s;ons have been &s;ent to Botany Bay. In fact, freedom of debate in parliament, is &s;ecured, by Statute 1. William and Mary 2d. in terms &s;imilar to tho&s;e u&s;ed in the Con&s;titution of the Uni|ted States.</P>
<P>I contend therefore, and it appears clear, that if the words freedom of the pre&s;s, have any meaning at all, they mean a to|tal exemption from any law making any publication whatever criminal. Whether the unequivocal avowal of this doctrine in the United States would produce mi&s;|chief or not, is a que&s;tion which perhaps I may have lei&s;ure to di&s;cu&s;s. I mu&s;t be content here to ob&s;erve, that the mi&s;chief if any, which might ari&s;e from this doc|trine, could not be remedied or prevented, but by means of a power fatal to the li|berty of the people.</P>
<P>That the real meaning of the words "freedom of the pre&s;s," has been a&s;cer|tained by the foregoing remarks, will ap|pear still more clearly, if po&s;&s;ible, from the ab&s;urdity of tho&s;e constructions which have been given by the advocates of the &s;edi|tion bill.</P>
<P>The con&s;truction clearly held out in the bill it&s;elf, is, that it does not extend to the
<PB N="44" REF="035605_0046_1005FD6025EB8500">privilege of printing facts, that are fal&s;e. This con&s;truction cannot be correct. It plainly &s;uppo&s;es that "freedom," extends only as far as the power of doing what is morally right. If, then, the freedom of the pre&s;s can be re&s;trained to the publication of facts, it follows, inevitably, that it may al&s;o be re&s;trained to the publication of true opinions. There is truth in opinion, as well as in fact. Error in opinion may do as much harm, as fal&s;ity in fact: it may be as morally wrong, and it may be propagated from motives as malicious. It may do more harm, becau&s;e the refutation of an opinion which is erroneous, is more difficult than the contradiction of a fact which is fal&s;e. But the power of control|ling opinions has never yet been claimed; yet it is manife&s;t that the &s;ame con&s;truc|tion, which warrants a control in matters of fact, does the &s;ame as to matters of opi|nion. In addition to this, it ought to be remarked, that the difficulty of di&s;tingui&s;h|ing in many ca&s;es between fact and opi|nion, is extremely great, and that no kind of criterion is furni&s;hed by the law under con&s;ideration. Of this more, perhaps, will be &s;aid hereafter.</P>
<P>Again, if the congre&s;&s;ional con&s;truction be right, if the freedom of the pre&s;s con|&s;i&s;ts in the full enjoyment of the privilege
<PB N="45" REF="035605_0047_1005FD61B4E99FB0">of printing facts that are true, it will be fair to read the amendment, without the words really u&s;ed, after &s;ub&s;tituting tho&s;e &s;aid by Congre&s;s to have the &s;ame import. The clau&s;e will then &s;tand thus: "Con|gre&s;s &s;hall make no law abridging the right of the pre&s;s, to publi&s;h facts that are true!" If this was the real meaning of Congre&s;s, and the &s;everal &s;tates, when they &s;poke in the &s;tate con&s;titutions, and in the amendment of the "freedom of the pre&s;s," the very great &s;olicitude on this &s;ubject di&s;|played throughout the continent, was most irrational and ab&s;urd. If this was their meaning, the "palladium" of liberty is indeed a "wooden &s;tatue," and the bulwark of freedom is indeed a de&s;pi|cable fortification of paper. The officers of the government would have a right to in|vade this fortification, and to make pri|&s;oners of the garri&s;on, whenever they thought that there was a failure in the duty of publi&s;hing only the truth, of which failure per&s;ons cho&s;en by the go|vernment are to judge. This is too ab|&s;urd even for ridicule.</P>
<P>That &s;uch was not the meaning of the convention of Virginia is manifest. They &s;olemnly protest again&s;t any kind of legi&s;|lative control, and declare, that the free|dom
<PB N="46" REF="035605_0048_1005FD65AB832518">of the pre&s;s is not to be restrained or modified by any law whatever.</P>
<P>This venerable and enlightened a&s;&s;em|bly had too much wi&s;dom to avow a mean|ing, &s;o totally incompatible with the real object of their wi&s;hes. They knew that there never was a government in the world, however de&s;potic, that dared to avow a de&s;ign to &s;uppre&s;s the truth: they know that the most corrupt and profligate admini&s;trations, that ever brought wretch|edne&s;s and oppre&s;&s;ion upon a happy and free people, &s;peak in their public acts the language of patrioti&s;m and virtue only, and that, although their real object is to &s;top inquiry, and to terrify truth into &s;ilence, the vengeance of the law <HI>appears</HI> to be directed again&s;t fal&s;ehood and ma|lice only: in fact, they know, that there are many truths, important to &s;ociety, which are not &s;u&s;ceptible of that full, di|rect, and po&s;itive evidence, which can alone be exhibited before a court and jury:</P>
<P>That men might be, and often would be deterred from &s;peaking truths, which they could prove, unle&s;s they were ab&s;o|lutely protected from the trouble, di&s;|grace, lo&s;&s;es, and expence of a pro&s;ecu|tion:</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="035605_0049_1005FD6802172418">
That in the violence of party &s;pirit which government knows too well how to produce, and to inflame evidence; the most conclu&s;ive, might be rejected, and that juries might be packed, "who would find Abel guilty of the murder of Cain:"</P>
<P>That nothing tends more to irritate the minds of men, and di&s;turb the peace of &s;oci|ety, than pro&s;ecutions of a political nature, which like pro&s;ecutions in religion, in|crea&s;e the evils, they were, perhaps, in|tended to remove:</P>
<P>They knew that the licentiou&s;ne&s;s of the pre&s;s, though an evil, was a le&s;s evil than that re&s;ulting from any law to re&s;train it, upon the &s;ame principle that the mo&s;t en|lightened part of the world is at length convinced, that the evils ari&s;ing from the toleration of here&s;y and athei&s;m, are le&s;s, in&s;initely le&s;s, than the evils of per&s;ecu|tion:</P>
<P>That the &s;pirit of inquiry and di&s;cu&s;|&s;ion, was of the utmo&s;t importance in eve|ry free country, and could be pre&s;erved only by giving it ab&s;olute protection, even in its exce&s;&s;es:</P>
<P>That truth was always equal to the ta&s;k of combating fal&s;ehood without the aid of government; becau&s;e in mo&s;t in|&s;tances it has defeated fal&s;ehood, backed by all the power of government:</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="035605_0050_1005FD69971FCCC0">
That truth cannot be impre&s;&s;ed upon the human mind by power, with which, therefore, it di&s;dains an alliance, but by rea&s;on and evidence only.</P>
<P>They knew the &s;ublime precept inculca|ted by the act e&s;tabli&s;hing religious free dom, that "where di&s;cu&s;&s;ion is free, error cea&s;es to be dangerous:" and, therefore, they wi&s;ely aimed at the total exclu&s;ion of all Congre&s;&s;ional juri&s;diction.</P>
<P>But, it has been &s;aid, that the freedom of the pre&s;s, con&s;i&s;ts not in the privilege of printing truth; but in an exemption from previous re&s;traint, and as the &s;edi|tion bill impo&s;es no previous re&s;traint, it does not abridge the freedom of the pre&s;s. This <HI>profound</HI> remark is borrowed from Black&s;tone and De Lolme, and is gravely repeated, by tho&s;e who are weak enough to take opinions upon tru&s;t.</P>
<P>If the&s;e writers meant to &s;tate what the law was under&s;tood to be in England, they are correct. Even if they meant to &s;tate what the law ought to be in Eng|land, perhaps they are &s;till correct; be|cau&s;e it is extremely probable, that a pre&s;s ab&s;olutely free, would in the &s;hort cour&s;e of one year "humble in the du&s;t and a&s;hes," the "&s;tupendous fabric," of the Briti&s;h government. But this defini|tion does not de&s;erve to be tran&s;planted
<PB N="49" REF="035605_0051_1005FD6D4981E238">into America. In Britain, a legi&s;lative control over the pre&s;s, is, perhaps e&s;&s;en|tial to the pre&s;ervation of the "pre&s;ent order of things;" but it does not follow, that &s;uch control is e&s;&s;ential here. In Bri|tain, a va&s;t &s;tanding army is nece&s;&s;ary to keep the people in peace, and the monarch on his throne; but it does not follow that the tranquillity of America, or the per&s;on|al &s;afety of the Pre&s;ident, would be pro|moted by a &s;imilar in&s;titution.</P>
<P>A &s;ingle remark will be &s;ufficient to expo&s;e the extreme fallacy of the idea, when applied to the constitution of the United States. If the freedom of the pre&s;s con&s;ists in an exemption from previ|ous restraint, Congre&s;s may, without in|jury to the freedom of the pre&s;s, puni&s;h with death any thing <HI>actually</HI> publi&s;hed, which a political inqui&s;ition may chu&s;e to condemn.</P>
<P>But on what ground is this Briti&s;h doctrine about the freedom of the pre&s;s introduced here? In Britain, the parlia|ment is acknowledged to be omnipotent. It has exerci&s;ed this omnipotence, and converted three years into &s;even years. In Britain there is no constitution, no li|mitation of legi&s;lative power; but in A|merica, there is a constitution, the power of the legi&s;lature is limited, and the ob|ject
<PB N="50" REF="035605_0052_1005FD6FA7DA6C50">of one limitation is to &s;ecure the free|dom of the pre&s;s.</P>
<P>If this doctrine is avowed here, under the idea that the common law of England is in force in the United States, even this idea will be of no avail. The com|mon law knows nothing of printing or the liberty of the pre&s;s. The art of printing was not di&s;covered, until towards the clo&s;e of the 15th century. It was at fir&s;t in England, a &s;ubject of &s;tar-chamber ju|ri&s;diction, and afterwards put under a li|cencer by &s;tatute. This &s;tatute expired ju&s;t before the commencement of the pre|&s;ent century. Before this event, the rights of the pre&s;s, were at the mercy of a &s;in|gle individual. There can be no common law, no immemorial u&s;age or cu&s;tom con|cerning a thing of &s;o modern a date.</P>
<P>The freedom of the pre&s;s, therefore, means the total exemption of the pre&s;s from any kind of legi&s;lative control, and con&s;equently the &s;edition bill, which is an act of legi&s;lative control, is an abridgment of its liberty, and expre&s;sly forbidden by the con&s;titution. Which was to be de|mon&s;trated.</P>
<P>In the foregoing pages, I have kept clear of authorities and quotations, even when expre&s;sly in point. The&s;e can be re&s;orted to without my help. I do not
<PB N="51" REF="035605_0053_1005FD71325D3040">contemn the opinions of others; but di&s;|cu&s;&s;ion is endle&s;s, where authorities are re|lied on. I have kept clear too, of per&s;o|nal remarks. The&s;e would have been justified by the manners of the times, and to many, would have been more acceptable than argument it&s;elf. But the influence of truth is not aided by invective and re|proach. I have addre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf there|fore to the under&s;tanding only;&mdash;and I hope, that the &s;acred cau&s;e of liberty and truth, if not promoted by the arguments, has not been di&s;graced by the temper or language of</P>
