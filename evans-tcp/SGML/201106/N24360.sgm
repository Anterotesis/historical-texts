<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>IT will be recollected, my fellow citizens, that while I have claimed, as one of the repre&s;entatives of the American people, the right of acting according to my own judgment, on all que&s;tions which concern their general intere&s;ts, I have always deemed it my duty to you, from whom I received the appointment, to make you acquainted, not only with my opinion and conduct on every important mea&s;ure, but al&s;o with the rea&s;ons by which I have been guided.</P>
<P>This duty I am now about to fulfil in a ca&s;e of the highe&s;t importance. Having on two former occa&s;ions declared to you in the mo&s;t unre&s;erved manner, my opinion re&s;pecting the differences which have unfortu|nately ari&s;en between this country and France, I am now about to explain the rea&s;ons whereon that opinion is founded.</P>
<P>After &s;tating &s;ome con&s;iderations which have induced me to believe that the charges alledged again&s;t us by France, are wholly unfounded, I &s;hall endeavour to place her conduct and views re&s;pecting this country in their true light, and to develope the general &s;y&s;tem of policy towards other nations, which &s;he appears to be pur&s;uing. This part of the &s;ubject I apprehend will
<PB N="4" REF="032226_0005_0FF199DECEA8F5D0">be found de&s;erving of particular attention; for without taking into view her general plan of foreign policy, it will be extremely difficult to di&s;cern the principles whereby her conduct towards our&s;elves is directed.</P>
<P>And permit me, fellow citizens, to introduce my remarks on this &s;ubject, by a declaration to the truth whereof mo&s;t of you can bear witne&s;s. Permit me to declare, that while France appeared to be engaged in a &s;truggle for liberty and national independence, no heart beat higher than mine with affection for her cau&s;e. I joined with enthu&s;ia&s;m in the general exultation of my country for her victories, mourned for her di&s;a&s;ters, and wi&s;hed to draw a veil over her crimes, her follies, and her exce&s;&s;es. Even her crimes appeared only as mi&s;takes in my eyes, and her mo&s;t enormous atroci|ties as natural, and perhaps nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equences of the violent external and internal &s;truggles wherein &s;he was engaged; I called them the crimes of the re|volution, not of France, and I pardoned them. Where I could not pardon, I excu&s;ed, I palliated. I con&s;idered her as fighting in the cau&s;e of freedom and humanity, and an end &s;o excellent afforded much con&s;olation for the means which &s;he often employed.</P>
<P>This end we have now &s;een her mo&s;t fully attain. We have &s;een her repel all her enemies, and e&s;tabli&s;h her independance upon the firme&s;t and mo&s;t formidable ba&s;is. We have &s;een her in&s;tead of being cru&s;hed her&s;elf, threatening to cru&s;h all the &s;urrounding &s;tates; annex|ing &s;ome to her&s;elf, reducing others to an ab&s;olute &s;ub|&s;erviency to her will, and making deep inroads on the power of the re&s;t; we have &s;een her after various re|volutions at home, adopt at length the government for which &s;he contended, the government of her own free choice.</P>
<P>Why then in&s;tead of confining her&s;elf to her own defence, has &s;he become the a&s;&s;ailant? Why does &s;he refu&s;e that peace which her enemies have over and over propo&s;ed, and whereby &s;he would be left in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of very large acqui&s;itions? Why after renouncing repeat|edly, and in the mo&s;t formal manner, all idea of con|que&s;t, does &s;he &s;till pre&s;s on to new conque&s;ts, and proudly refu&s;e even to treat for peace, unle&s;s all that
<PB N="5" REF="032226_0006_0FF199E064255F48">&s;he has &s;eized be fir&s;t confirmed to her, and all that &s;he has lo&s;t be fir&s;t re&s;tored?<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is on this ground that &s;he has twice repul&s;ed the advances of Eng|land and Au&s;tria; &s;he has expre&s;ly refu&s;ed the ba&s;is of <HI>mutual re&s;titution,</HI> and declared that &s;he would not hear any propo&s;al re&s;ting on it. This a|mounts to &s;aying, all that I have taken I will keep, and all that you have taken you &s;hall give up, and then I will hear what you have to &s;ay</NOTE></P>
<P>Why does &s;he compel all tho&s;e &s;tates, who&s;e councils &s;he can influence or co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">troul, to join her in the war? Why does &s;he endeavour to excite the Ru&s;&s;ians and the Tutks again&s;t Au&s;tria, which offers and even &s;oli|cits peace on terms highly advantageous to her? Why does &s;he attempt to bribe Pru&s;&s;ia with a part of the &s;poils of Au&s;tria, to a&s;&s;i&s;t her in reducing it under her power? Why does &s;he &s;trive to arm every neutral &s;tate again&s;t the commerce of the Engli&s;h, and to exclude their &s;hips from every port? Why does &s;he declare that &s;he will never lay down her arms 'till &s;he has broken and de&s;troyed the maritime &s;trength of England?</P>
<P>It is that &s;he has formed a plan of aggrandi&s;ement at the expen&s;e of all her neighbours; that after the ex|ample of the Romans, tho&s;e ferocious and &s;y&s;tematic de&s;troyers of mankind, &s;he has re&s;olved to make all Europe, and finally the whole world, bend beneath her yoke; a re&s;olution in the accompli&s;hment whereof &s;he pur&s;ues the Roman policy, of dividing to de&s;troy; of bribing one nation with the &s;poils of another; of in|ticing the &s;tronger to inaction, reducing the weak to &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, and by the re&s;ources of the one, and the connivance of the other, breaking the &s;trength of tho&s;e who&s;e power &s;he dreads, and who&s;e policy &s;he cannot deceive.</P>
<P>And is this a project, my fellow citizens, in which we ought to wi&s;h her &s;ucce&s;s? Is it de&s;irable that the balance of power, whereby the great nations of Europe have heretofore been mutually checked, and in &s;ome degree confined within the limits of ju&s;tice and mo|deration, &s;hould be wholly de&s;troyed, to make way for one uncontrouled and de&s;potic ma&s;ter, who&s;e power being unchecked, mu&s;t from the very con&s;titution of human nature, be con&s;tantly abu&s;ed? Is this a plan which de&s;erves the good wi&s;hes of this country? Shall we be more &s;afe when Europe &s;hall have been reduced
<PB N="6" REF="032226_0007_0FF199E35282D888">under the uncontrouled influence of France, than while her power is checked and balanced by that of other nations, who will be induced by the de&s;ire of pre&s;erving that balance to &s;hield us from her aggre&s;&s;ions? I believe that every principle of &s;ound policy will an&s;wer in the negative.</P>
<P>Had France however, been content to pur&s;ue her pro|jects of ambition in Europe, and leave us in peace, though we might have wi&s;hed, for the good of humani|ty, to &s;ee them defeated, yet a due regard to our own intere&s;ts, and even to tho&s;e of the civilized world, would have forbidden us to join in the attempt: for although we &s;hould certainly be expo&s;ed to temporary evils by the preponderance of her power, yet our &s;trength in|crea&s;es with a rapidity, which mu&s;t place us in a very &s;hort time beyond the reach of danger or dread, and may al&s;o enable us to pre&s;erve the liberties of mankind, by forming a counterpoi&s;e and a check to the ambition of France, after they &s;hall be lo&s;t in Europe. This &s;trength would be greatly dimini&s;hed, and its increa&s;e long retarded by a premature exertion. To remain in peace therefore, amid&s;t the pre&s;ent conflict of empires, was a duty to our&s;elves, to po&s;terity, and to the hu|man race.</P>
<P>This wi&s;e policy, the re&s;ult of deep fore&s;ight, and of an enlightened regard to the intere&s;ts of this coun|try and of humanity, was early adopted by our go|vernment. But France did not thus judge, nor &s;o de|termine. She early &s;aw in this country a powerful in|&s;trument for promoting her ambition, and &s;he early formed a re&s;olution to u&s;e it. Hence her efforts to gain the controul of our affairs: hence her uncea&s;ing endea|vours to excite jealou&s;ies again&s;t the government, and divi&s;ions among the people, to blow up our animo&s;i|ties again&s;t England, and foment our ancient di&s;con|tents. Hence tho&s;e unfounded preten&s;ions, which we &s;aw her fir&s;t mini&s;ter &s;et up; preten&s;ions which, if ad|mitted, mu&s;t have placed the affairs of this country intirely under his controul. Hence did we &s;ee him, when the government refu&s;ed to yield to the&s;e pre|ten&s;ions, treating it with in&s;ult and outrage, and threat|ening to appeal from its deci&s;ions to the people. We
<PB N="7" REF="032226_0008_0FF199E793CE05C8">&s;aw him arm and commi&s;&s;ion privateers in our ports, again&s;t the expre&s;s orders of the government, and &s;end them to &s;ea in contempt of its authority. We &s;aw him attempt to levy an army in our country, for the pur|po&s;e of invading nations with whom we were in peace. We &s;aw him make a formal complaint again&s;t the Pre|&s;ident for refu&s;ing to convene Congre&s;s at his in&s;tance.</P>
<P>All this he did in the avowed pur&s;uit of the object of his in&s;tructions, which, to u&s;e their own words, en|joined him <Q>to excite to the utmo&s;t the zeal of the Americans, and induce them, if po&s;&s;ible, to make a common cau&s;e with France.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the in&s;tructions to Mr. Genet publi&s;hed by him&s;elf on the 20th of December, 1793</NOTE></Q> </P>
<P>When he was recalled on our complaining of his conduct, our warm and partial regard for France induced us to hope, and even to believe, that the &s;y&s;tem was relinqui&s;hed with the change of the Mini&s;ter.</P>
<P>We &s;oon however found our mi&s;take; we found that not the object, but the mode of pur&s;uing it had been changed; and that in&s;tead of threats and blu&s;tering whereby it was perceived that the plan was counteracted in&s;tead of being promoted, an artful in&s;idious cour&s;e was adopted, more dangerous becau&s;e more deceptive.</P>
<P>With this change in the form, the principles and &s;ub&s;tance of Genet's &s;y&s;tem were invariably pur&s;ued by his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors: the &s;ame attempts to drive us from our neutrality, under the pretence of pre&s;erving it, were renewed and ince&s;&s;antly repeated: his mo&s;t inadmi&s;&s;able pretentions, tho&s;e pretentions &s;o incompatible with our &s;overeignty, &s;o repugnant to our &s;y&s;tem of impar|tial neutrality, were renewed and uncea&s;ingly urged; and the &s;teady refu&s;al of our Government to yield to them, with its firm re&s;olution, to per&s;i&s;t in conducting our affairs in the manner which it conceived mo&s;t con|ducive to our intere&s;ts, and mo&s;t con&s;onant with ju&s;tice towards other nations, have been made the ground of proceedings on the part of France, the mo&s;t in&s;ulting and injurious. The French Government has at length made that appeal to the people of America, which her Min|i&s;ter formerly threatened. It has explained its preten&s;ions, &s;tated its complaints, and detailed its injuries. In re|venge
<PB N="8" REF="032226_0009_0FF199E938638430">for tho&s;e injuries, as it informs us, it has brok|en the treaty between the two countries, let loo&s;e its &s;hips of war and privateers to pillage and maltreat our citizens, and has in&s;ultingly driven from its territo|ry a mini&s;ter &s;ent expre&s;sly to explain and conciliate. It has declared, that it will hear nothing from us, until the injuries of which it complains are redre&s;&s;ed; or in other words, that we mu&s;t &s;ubmit to the terms which it &s;hall think proper to pre&s;cribe, before it will deign to negociate, or even to conver&s;e, on the points in di&s;pute. It has informed us that it is "terrible to its enemies;" reminded us, as it has very frequently done before, that we are indebted to it for our independence; and pro|mi&s;ed <Q>that when we bring back our Government to its true principles, we &s;hall again be regarded as friends and allies.</Q></P>
<P>It has &s;aid in effect, <Q>you Americans whom we re|deemed from &s;lavery when you were about to &s;ink again under the yoke of your former ma&s;ters, and who for that rea&s;on ought to become in all things &s;ub&s;ervient to us, have in&s;tituted a government which in the management of your affairs, has pre&s;umed to judge for it&s;elf, and refu&s;ed to be guided by our di|rections. As a friendly admonition of our ju&s;t di&s;|plea&s;ure, we take your ve&s;&s;els, confi&s;cate your pro|perty, and throw your citizens into dungeons and pri&s;on &s;hips; for we are 'terrible to our enemies.' But as &s;oon as you &s;hall reclaim your government from its errors, and teach it to conform to our will, you &s;hall again be received into favour. In the mean time, having &s;ignified to you our plea&s;ure, we expect &s;ilent and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive compliance. We will hear nothing from you, or from this government which has given us offence, until you repent and amend. The rod, under which you now &s;mart, &s;hall &s;till be ex|tended over you, till you ki&s;s it and return to your duty. Then indeed will we hold out the &s;ceptre of forgivene&s;s; for though 'terrible to our enemies,' we are generous to our friends.</Q> This is the plain lan|guage of their conduct, the true interpretation of their words.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="032226_0010_0FF199EC39F3F3E8">
And is America &s;o low, &s;o fallen, that &s;he mu&s;t tame|ly and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ively ki&s;s this rod? Has that &s;pirit which twenty years ago, when &s;he had not half her pre|&s;ent population, not a tenth part of her pre&s;ent wealth, no government, no bond of union among her different parts, no experience of her &s;trength, no e&s;tabli&s;hments of national defence, no name, no exi&s;tence as a people; which then impelled her to re&s;i&s;t the haughty preten|&s;ions and tyrannical encroachments of Britain, in the zenith of her power and elated by her recent triumph over the arms of France; is that &s;pirit &s;o totally extin|gui&s;hed, that &s;he mu&s;t crouch at the feet of this haugh|ty, this ambitious republic, and by abject &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, purcha&s;e a precarious, a di&s;honourable quiet?

The American people, then my fellow citizens, and you as part of them, are called upon to decide be|tween their own government, and that of another nati|on; to decide whether their affairs &s;hall be conducted by tho&s;e whom they have &s;elected for that purpo&s;e from among them&s;elves, or by the agents of a foreign power: Whether that power under pretence of a treaty, which it a&s;&s;erts an exclu&s;ive right to expound, and claims the priviledge of violating as often as its operation &s;hall be found di&s;advantageous,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Mr. Adet's note of October 27, 1796; where this right is expre&s;sly a&s;&s;erted.</NOTE> and of the law of nations, which it has publicly profe&s;&s;ed to di&s;regard,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See the letter of M.

Can the deci&s;ion be difficult?</P>
<P>And what are the&s;e preten&s;ions, which France enforces by the plunder of our merchants, and the impri&s;onment of our citizens? What are tho&s;e injuries which &s;he avenges by in&s;ulting our government and our country, and wherof, with a more than magi&s;terial haughtine&s;s, &s;he declares, that the redre&s;s &s;hall precede all explanation?</P>
<P>She complains of our treaty with Great Britain, of the con&s;truction which we have put on &s;ome articles of her own treaties with us, of our refu&s;al to form a new and
<PB N="11" REF="032226_0012_0FF199F36BA0C320">more comprehen&s;ive treaty with her; of a backwardne&s;s, which &s;he &s;ays, has appeared on our part, to accept her a&s;&s;i&s;tance in our negotiation with Algiers, and of viola|tions of our neutrality, which, &s;he alledges, we have authori&s;ed, or winked at in favour of England. Of the Briti&s;h treaty &s;he complains, <Q>that it is a violation of the treaty concluded with France in 1778, and equi|valent to a treaty of alliance with Great Britain.</Q> She declares that in this treaty <Q>the United States have knowingly and evidently &s;acrificed their connections with the republic, and the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential and lea&s;t conte&s;ted prerogatives of neutrality.</Q></P>
<P>But in this treaty the rights of France are expre&s;sly &s;ecured; for in the twenty-fifth article, it is provided, that, <Q>nothing in the treaty contained &s;hall be con&s;tru|ed, or operate, contrary to former and exi&s;ting pub|lic treaties, with other &s;overeigns or &s;tates?</Q> How then can this treaty infringe the rights of France, or violate the treaty &s;ub&s;i&s;ting between her and this coun|try.</P>
<P>But &s;he replies, it makes conce&s;&s;ions to Great Britain, of important rights; admitting this to be true, France could not complain; for tho&s;e rights would immediate|ly become common to her: It being expre&s;sly &s;tipulated in the &s;econd article of her treaty with us, <Q>that neither of the parties &s;hall grant any particular favour to other nations, in re&s;pect of commerce or navigation, which &s;hall not immediately become common to the other party, who &s;hall enjoy the &s;ame favour freely, if the conce&s;&s;ion is freely made, or on allowing the &s;ame compen&s;ation, if the conce&s;&s;ion was conditional;</Q> each party therefore may make conce&s;&s;ions to other na|tions. There is nothing in the treaty which forbids it; and if it &s;hould be done, the other party cannot com|plain: It however becomes entitled to the benefit of the conce&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>But what right have we conceded to the Briti&s;h by the late treaty? France charges us with having conceded to them the right to take the goods of their enemies, out of our neutral &s;hips; the right to con&s;ider various articles as contraband, which are not &s;o by the law of nations;
<PB N="12" REF="032226_0013_0FF199F4FB405D90">and the right, in &s;ome ca&s;es, to con&s;ider even provi&s;ions as contraband.</P>
<P>As to the right of taking enemies goods out of neutral ve&s;&s;els, it is not a right conceded to Britain by the treaty; the treaty &s;ays not one word about it, except that it &s;hall hereafter become the &s;ubject of negotiation, and that if ve&s;&s;els in the mean time, &s;hall be &s;top'd on that ac|count, they &s;hall be relea&s;ed with as little delay and in|convenience as po&s;&s;ible: It is a right, indi&s;putably given by the law of nations; and which Britain, tho' we urged her to the utmo&s;t of our power, refu&s;ed to &s;urrender at pre&s;ent; the exerci&s;e of it, being of the greate&s;t impor|tance to her in the pre&s;ent war: She however intimated that hereafter, it might perhaps be relinqui&s;hed. It was then agreed that things &s;hould remain, for the pre&s;ent, on the footing whereon the law of nations has placed them, and that hereafter, negociations &s;hall take place on the &s;ubject. Does this look like conceding a right! What more could we do; could we make war on Bri|tain, to compel the relinqui&s;hment of this right? This no doubt was what France wi&s;hed; it has been the ob|ject of all her intrigues, all her threats, and all her com|plaints; but our government wi&s;ely took a different re|&s;olution.</P>
<P>That this right was given to Britain by the law of nations, we have the expre&s;s authority of Mr. Jeffer|&s;on, of every writer on the &s;ubject, and of France her&s;elf.</P>
<P>Mr, Jeffer&s;on in his letter to Mr. Genet, of July 24, 1793, &s;ays, <Q>I believe it cannot be doubted, that by the general law of nations, the goods of a friend found in the ve&s;&s;els of an enemy are free, and <HI>the goods of an enemy found in the ve&s;&s;els of a friend, are lawful prize.</HI> Upon this principle, I pre&s;ume, the Briti&s;h ve&s;&s;els have taken the property of French ci|tizens found in our ve&s;&s;els, and I confe&s;s I &s;hould be at a lo&s;s on what principle to reclaim it. It is true, that &s;undry nations, de&s;irous of avoiding the inconvenience of having their ve&s;&s;els &s;topt at &s;ea, &amp;c. have in many in&s;tances introduced by their &s;pecial treaties, another principle between them, that ene|my bottoms &s;hall make enemy goods, and friendly
<PB N="13" REF="032226_0014_0FF199F811D51BF8">bottoms friendly goods; <HI>but this is altogether the ef|fect of particular treaties, controuling in &s;pecial ca&s;es the general principles of the law of nations.</HI> England has generally determined to adhere to the rigorous prin|ciple.</Q>&mdash;Afterwards in his letter of Augu&s;t 16th, 1793, to our mini&s;ter in Paris, on the &s;ubject of Mr. Genet's conduct, he &s;ays, <Q>We &s;uppo&s;e it to have been long an e&s;tabli&s;hed principle of the law of na|tions, that the goods of a friend are free in an ene|my's ve&s;&s;el, and <HI>the goods of an enemy lawful prize in the ve&s;&s;els of a friend.</HI> We have e&s;tabli&s;hed a con|trary principle, that free &s;hips &s;hall make free goods, in our treaties with France, Holland, and Pru&s;&s;ia, it is our wi&s;h to e&s;tabli&s;h it with other nations; but this requires their con&s;ent al&s;o, and is a work of time. <HI>In the mean time they have a right to act on the general principle,</HI> (that enemies goods are prize on board of neutral &s;hips,) <HI>without giving us or France cau&s;e of complaint.</HI></Q></P>
<P>So &s;ay all the mo&s;t re&s;pectable writers on the law of nations, with Vattel at their head, who&s;e works, tho' treated with contempt by Mr. Genet, and called "worm-eaten volumes," are acknowledged as autho|rity by all the nations of Europe.</P>
<P>France, however, has &s;ufficiently proved, not only by her declarations, but by her conduct, that &s;he pays no regard to the writers on the law of nations, or to the law it&s;elf; but perhaps &s;he will permit her own laws and public acts to be relied on as authority.</P>
<P>By her treaty with this country in 1778, &s;he ex|pre&s;ly relinqui&s;hed the right of taking enemies goods out of neutral ve&s;&s;els: &s;he did the &s;ame thing by her treaty with England in 1786; but why &s;hould &s;he re|linqui&s;h this right, if &s;he did not believe her&s;elf to have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed it? How could &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;s it but by vir|tue of the law of nations? That &s;he did believe her|&s;elf to po&s;&s;e&s;s it, is mo&s;t evident, from her marine laws, in one of which, pa&s;&s;ed in the year 1744, and in force when this treaty was made; it is provided, <Q>that if there are found on board of neutral ve&s;&s;els, of whatever nation they may be, merchandizes belonging to the enemies of his maje&s;ty, (which is the &s;ame as of
<PB N="14" REF="032226_0015_0FF199FAFA3C7668">France,) they &s;hall be good prize, even though they be not of the growth or manufacture of the ene|mies country.</Q></P>
<P>If then it be not permitted by the law of nations, to take enemies goods out of neutral ve&s;&s;els, the &s;tand|ing marine regulations of France, which remained of force from 1744 to 1778, little le&s;s than half a century, were a plain and direct infringement of that law.</P>
<P>And yet France alledges that we have conceded to Great Britain, the right to take the goods of her ene|mies out of our neutral ve&s;&s;els!</P>
<P>She even pretends that the law of nations is altered in this re&s;pect, by what &s;he calls the principles of the modern law, introduced by the armed neutrality; and this modern law of nations &s;he &s;ays we have aban|doned.</P>
<P>But what is this armed neutrality, by which the law of nations is &s;aid to have been altered? What is this modern law of nations, by which the former &s;y&s;tem is &s;aid to have been &s;uperceded?</P>
<P>During the American war, the Empre&s;s of Ru&s;&s;ia publi&s;hed a declaration of the principles on which &s;he would protect her &s;ubjects in carrying on commerce. One of the&s;e principles was, <Q>that free &s;hips &s;hould make free goods.</Q> She invited the neutral powers to join with her in this declaration, and ordered her fleet to arm in &s;upport of it. Several of them did join, particularly Denmark, Sweden, and the other northern powers, and they entered into a convention to &s;upport each other. This is what is called the armed neutra|lity, which being no more than a partial agreement among certain &s;tates, in the nature of a treaty, could make no alteration in the general law of nations. It could only, like any other treaty, modify that law with re&s;pect to the contracting parties them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Yet this agreement thus partial in its extent, and violated &s;ince by its authors them&s;elves, is the modern law of nations, for the e&s;tabli&s;hment and defence of which, the United States are required by France to engage, again&s;t the mo&s;t obvious dictates of prudence, in a quarrel with the greate&s;t maritime power on earth.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="032226_0016_0FF199FDE62313A8">
If the charge of conceding to Britain, the right to take the goods of France out of our ve&s;&s;els, a right which the law of nations gives her, and which, far from con|ceding, we did all in our power to prevail on her to re|linqui&s;h, has appeared to be wholly untrue; that which relates to contraband, is equally void of foundation.</P>
<P>By the law of nations, there are certain goods which neutral nations cannot carry to one power at war, with|out their being good prize, if taken by the other: the&s;e goods are called <HI>contraband,</HI> they include, according to the be&s;t writers on the law of nations, <Q>commodities particularly u&s;ed in war; &s;uch as <HI>arms,</HI> military and <HI>naval</HI> &s;tores, <HI>&s;hip timber, hor&s;es,</HI> and even provi&s;ions in certain junctures;</Q> and the prohibition re&s;ts on this principle, that a nation engaged in war, has a right as a natural means of defence, to prevent its ene|my as far as it can, from being &s;upplied with tho&s;e things, which are peculiarly of u&s;e in carrying on the war; but tho' the law of nations enumerates the articles which &s;hall be con&s;idered generally as contraband, and &s;pecifies the particular ca&s;es, in which even other articles may be added to the li&s;t; yet in this re&s;pect, as in all others, its operation as to particular &s;tates, is liable to be re|&s;tricted and modified by treaties between them. Two &s;tates for in&s;tance, have a right by the law of nations, to con&s;ider naval &s;tores as contraband, and each to pre|vent the other from carrying them to its enemy, as far as this can be effected by capture and condemnation; but the&s;e two &s;tates may agree mutually, to relinqui&s;h this right; and may make a treaty for that purpo&s;e; this treaty does not alter the law of nations, as to others; any more than an agreement between two men, that neither of them &s;hould go along &s;uch a road, would pre|vent other people from u&s;ing it; it only re&s;tricts the operation of the law as to them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Treaties of this kind, are very u&s;ual among nations: In &s;ome of them naval &s;tores are agreed to be contra|band; in others, not. In our treaty with France, made in the year 1778, the right to con&s;ider &s;hip timber and naval &s;tores as contraband is mutually relinqui&s;hed. When we came to treat on this &s;ubject with Great Britain,
<PB N="16" REF="032226_0017_0FF199FF77EE7F28">we were anxious to prevail on her to relinqui&s;h i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> al&s;o, but &s;he refu&s;ed: She in&s;i&s;ted on her right by the law of nations, and we had no means of compelling her to recede; naval &s;tores and &s;hip timber therefore, not|with&s;tanding our efforts to get them excepted, continue to be contraband between us and Great Britain, as they were before the treaty.</P>
<P>And yet one of the accu&s;ations of France again&s;t the United States, and again&s;t this treaty, is, that it has ceded to Britain the right of con&s;idering, naval &s;tores as contraband! we are charged with giving to Britain, what &s;he had before, and what we &s;trove in vain to make her relinqui&s;h!</P>
<P>But, &s;ays France, if &s;hip timber and naval &s;tores were contraband before, why mention them in the trea|ty! Becau&s;e it is u&s;eful, that the rules whereby the con|duct of nations towards each other is to be regulated&punc; &s;hould become as public, as preci&s;e, as little doubtful as po&s;&s;ible; any merchant can read a treaty, though every one does not find lei&s;ure or opportunity to &s;tudy the law of nations; for this rea&s;on, and a very good one it is, the enumeration was made.</P>
<P>The la&s;t accu&s;ation of France again&s;t this treaty, is, <Q>That it concedes to Britain the right of con&s;idering even provi&s;ions as contraband; and thereby becomes manife&s;tly injurious to France, who&s;e &s;upplies from this country, it permits Britain to cut off,</Q> This charge is, if po&s;&s;ible, even more void of foundation than the former.</P>
<P>The part of the treaty complained of, is the &s;econd clau&s;e of the 18th article; which in&s;tead of being a con|ce&s;&s;ion by us to Britain, is a very valuable conce&s;&s;ion by her to us; and far from offering any injury to France, mu&s;t when it affects her at all, operate very much to her advantage; to prove this nothing more is nece&s;&s;ary than &s;imply to recite the clau&s;e; which is in the following words:</P>
<P><Q>And whereas the difficulty of agreeing on the pre|ci&s;e ca&s;es, in which alone provi&s;ions and other arti|cles not generally contrabanded, may be con&s;idered as &s;uch, renders it expedient to provide again&s;t the inconveniences and mi&s;under&s;tandings which might
<PB N="17" REF="032226_0018_0FF19A02B7EC6030">thence ari&s;e. It is further agreed, that whenever any &s;uch articles, &s;o becoming contraband, <HI>according to the exi&s;ting laws of nations,</HI> &s;hall <HI>for that rea&s;on</HI> be &s;eized, the &s;ame &s;hall not be <HI>confi&s;cated,</HI> but the owners thereof, &s;hall be &s;peedily and completely in|demnified; and the captors, or in their default the government under who&s;e authority they act, &s;hall pay to the ma&s;ters or owners of &s;uch ve&s;&s;els the full value of all &s;uch articles; with a rea&s;onable mercan|tile profit thereon, together with the freight, and al&s;o the demurrage incident to &s;uch detention.</Q></P>
<P>To what ca&s;es do the regulations of this clau&s;e apply? to &s;uch, and &s;uch only, where provi&s;ions &amp;c. may be regarded as contraband <HI>by the exi&s;ting law of nations;</HI> are there any &s;uch ca&s;es? no maxim in the law of nati|ons, is clearer or better e&s;tabli&s;hed, than that there are &s;uch; and if there are not, then it is manife&s;t that the article is perfectly harmle&s;s? and when provi&s;ions &amp;c. are &s;eized in &s;uch ca&s;es, what is to be done with them? in&s;tead of being confi&s;cated, as they might be by the law of nations, they are to be paid for with a mercantile profit, freight, and damages for the detention: In which ca&s;e is the ri&s;k to the merchant lea&s;t! certainly in the latter, where his goods, if taken, are not, as in the former, to be condemned as prize, but paid for with profit and charges: which regulation, that of the trea|ty, or that of the law of nations, is the mo&s;t beneficial to France? certainly that of the treaty; for where the ri&s;k is the lea&s;t, the merchant will be mo&s;t inclined to &s;end her provi&s;ions; and on what account was this re|gulation adopted? to prevent tho&s;e <HI>mi&s;under&s;tandings</HI> which might ari&s;e between us and Britain, from the difficulty of a&s;certaining the ca&s;es in which provi&s;ions are made contraband by the law of nations.</P>
<P>And yet France alledges, that we have ceded to Bri|tain, the right of con&s;idering provi&s;ions as contraband! and yet this article &s;o ju&s;t in it&s;elf, &s;o liberal on the part of Britain, &s;o beneficial to us, and &s;o u&s;eful to France her&s;elf, has been laid hold of by her, as a ground of quarrel! whence can proceed her di&s;plea&s;ure at this ar|ticle? the true cau&s;e of it is to be found in the word "mi&s;under&s;tandings" the tendency of this article, to
<PB N="18" REF="032226_0019_0FF19A05A3F7F648">prevent "mi&s;under&s;tandings" between this country and Britain, has given umbrage to France; tho&s;e mi&s;under|&s;tandings which it has been her uncea&s;ing endeavour to foment, and her con&s;tant hope to blow up into a quar|rel.</P>
<P>Hence too her anger at the treaty; hence tho&s;e objec|tions &s;o manife&s;tly unfounded; tho&s;e flimzy pretexts, which throw &s;o thin a veil over her real motives. She &s;aw many cau&s;es of difference exi&s;ting between this country and England; &s;he &s;aw tho&s;e cau&s;es aggravated by ancient re&s;entments, and recent injuries; and &s;he looked, with confident and eager expectation, to the moment, which &s;he thought fa&s;t approaching, when the&s;e differences &s;hould produce an open rupture: then &s;hould we become her a&s;&s;ociates in the war; then would our commerce be cut off from her rival; then, like Hol|land and Belgium, &s;hould we have been placed under the controul of her agents, our ports po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by her &s;hips, our towns &s;eized by her troops, our country pil|laged to &s;upply her armies, and our re&s;ources exhau&s;ted to repleni&s;h her trea&s;ury. If we e&s;caped the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;urrendering to her, as Holland has been compelled to do, important parts of our territory, as the price of what &s;he would not have failed to call "her protection" we &s;hould have had much rea&s;on to rejoice in our good fortune.</P>
<P>The&s;e pro&s;pects, which &s;he regarded as &s;o certain, and contemplated with &s;o much plea&s;ure, were bla&s;ted by the treaty. By it &s;he &s;aw our differences compo&s;ed, a mutual &s;pirit of ju&s;tice and conciliation re&s;tored, and the foundation of a friendly and beneficial intercour&s;e &s;olidly laid; hence her efforts to prevent its conclu&s;ion; hence her di&s;appointment and rage, at its final accom|pli&s;hment.</P>
<P>Thus manife&s;tly un&s;ounded, fellow citizens, thus plainly de&s;titute of even plau&s;ible appearances, are the o&s;|ten&s;ible objections, thus unfriendly and mi&s;chievous to us are the real motives, from which the French govern|ment declares, <Q>that &s;he regards this treaty as a viola|tion of that between her and this country, as equi|valent to an alliance with Great Britain, and as a wilful and evident &s;acrifice on the part of the United
<PB N="19" REF="032226_0020_0FF19A0A01048F20">States, of their connections with France, and of the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential and lea&s;t conte&s;ted rights of neu|trality.</Q></P>
<P>Let us examine her next charge, the charge of hav|ing put a wrong and injurious con&s;truction on &s;ome articles of her treaties with us.</P>
<P>Under this head &s;he complains, that contrary to the 17th article of the treaty of commerce, we have &s;uffer|ed our courts of ju&s;tice to take cognizance of prizes brought into our ports by her armed &s;hips; that in violation of the &s;ame article, Briti&s;h &s;hips of war, which have made prize of her ve&s;&s;els, have been al|lowed &s;helter in our harbours; that we have &s;uffered Briti&s;h &s;hips to arm in our ports; that we have prevent|ed the &s;ale of her prizes, which &s;he contends is per|mitted by the treaty; that a provi&s;ion of the con&s;ular convention, which makes part of the treaties, has been rendered ineffectual by our neglect to pa&s;s laws for en|abling the French con&s;uls to enforce their decrees; that our judges and magi&s;trates, in contempt of the fifth article of this con&s;ular convention, have required the ma&s;ters of French &s;hips, applying for warrants again&s;t ab&s;conding &s;ailors, to produce in evidence the original roll of their crews in&s;tead of the copy, whereby the power given to French con&s;uls of cau&s;ing the arre&s;t of &s;ailors who de&s;ert, has been greatly impeded; and finally, that contrary to the 19th article of the treaty of com|merce, we &s;uffered a public &s;hip of war, belonging to France, to be arre&s;ted in one of our ports, for acts done on the high &s;eas.</P>
<P>It is not of the deci&s;ion of prize cau&s;es made by our courts, that France complains, it is the right to decide which &s;he conte&s;ts. She alledges, that by the treaty of 1778, article the 17th, our courts are prohibited, in all ca&s;es what&s;oever, from taking cognizance of captures made under colour of a French commi&s;&s;ion. This is the true point of di&s;pute. If the courts be thus prohi|bited, their deci&s;ions however upright and legal in them&s;elves, mu&s;t be improper. If on the contrary, they have a right, notwith&s;tanding the treaty, to take cognizance in certain ca&s;es, of prizes made under pre|tence
<PB N="20" REF="032226_0021_0FF19A0B8EA8CAD8">of French commi&s;&s;ions, they mu&s;t be the judges when tho&s;e ca&s;es occur, and no complaint can be ad|mitted again&s;t their deci&s;ions.</P>
<P>I have &s;aid, <Q>under the pretence and colour of a French commi&s;&s;ion,</Q> becau&s;e, if the allegation of the French government be well founded, our courts are precluded in all ca&s;es where any thing called a French commi&s;&s;ion is produced: they can take no cognizance, can enquire into nothing; con&s;equently they cannot even enquire whether the commi&s;&s;ion be true or forg|ed; whether the ve&s;&s;el be in fact a privateer or a pirate.</P>
<P>To admit this preten&s;ion, would be to admit in the words of Mr. Jeffer&s;on,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> Augu&s;t 9<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, to Mr. Mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">r</NOTE><Q>that any armed ve&s;&s;el of any nation, might cut away our own &s;hips, or tho&s;e of per&s;ons coming to trade with us, from the wharves of Philadelphia, Charle&s;ton, or New York, and by call|ing them prizes, prevent our courts from redre&s;&s;ing the wrong.</Q> Can it be conceived, that any nation would cede &s;uch a right by treaty? The &s;tipulations on this &s;ubject between us and France are mutual. Can it be conceived, that France has intended to cede, or now would permit &s;uch a right to us? We know per|fectly well that &s;he would not.</P>
<P>The 17th article of our treaty with France indeed &s;tipulates that the prizes made on its enemies by one party &s;hall not <Q>be arre&s;ted or &s;eized when they come to enter the ports of the other; nor &s;hall the &s;earch|ers or other officers of &s;uch ports &s;earch &s;uch prizes, or make any examination concerning their lawful|ne&s;s.</Q> But we contend that the prizes here intended are prizes made on the high &s;eas, without the juri&s;dic|tion of either party; and not by its people, or by ve&s;&s;els equipt or armed in its ports. We contend that not|with&s;tanding this &s;tipulation, we have a right to protect our own ve&s;&s;els and tho&s;e of our neighbours, within our territories, and the juri&s;diction of our laws; that we have a right to prevent ve&s;&s;els from being armed and &s;itted in our ports for crui&s;ing again&s;t nations with whom we are at peace, and to re&s;train our citizens from
<PB N="21" REF="032226_0022_0FF19A0E98440558">carrying on war again&s;t tho&s;e nations under a foreign commi&s;&s;ion. The&s;e rights we contend, we ought to enforce, by re&s;toring property taken in contempt of them whenever it comes within our power. This and this alone our courts have done. In the&s;e three ca&s;es alone have they taken property from French captors, and re&s;tored it to the owners: where it was taken, ei|ther within the juri&s;diction of our Laws; by our own citizens, under French commi&s;&s;ions: or by ve&s;&s;els &s;itted out, armed, or equipped for war in our ports.</P>
<P>Of this France complains. Her Mini&s;ter had armed and commi&s;&s;ioned privateers in our ports; her armed ve&s;&s;els had &s;eized &s;hips, not only within a league of our coa&s;t, to which di&s;tance, by the Law of Nations, the juri&s;diction of every country extends, but even in the Delaware: our citizens had taken French commi&s;&s;ions, and under them made prize of ve&s;&s;els belonging to nations at peace with us. When prizes, made in either of the&s;e three ca&s;es, were brought into our ports, the courts interfered, and after trials in which the facts were proved, re&s;tored the property to the former owners. It is by this interference; &s;o nece&s;&s;ary for maintaining our neutrality and the independence of our government, that France alledges we have broken the treaty.</P>
<P>But this interference is ju&s;tified not only by nece&s;&s;ity, but by the Law of Nations, and their univer&s;al practice. To the&s;e, however, France has &s;hewn that &s;he pays very little regard; and to di&s;cu&s;s the points would lead to too great a length. But fortunately, we are &s;aved the trouble, &s;he has her&s;elf decided the que&s;tion in our favour. Her own laws now in force, and her own practice at this moment, &s;upport our interpretation of the treaty. Let us now hear France again&s;t her&s;elf: her laws again&s;t her complaints.</P>
<P>A commentary on the marine laws of France, drawn up by an<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Valin.</NOTE> officer of the government, and fir&s;t publi&s;hed under its authority in 1776, &s;ays, <Q>that as far as the di&s;tance of two leagues, the Sea, according to the rule univer&s;ally acknowledged, is under the dominion of the &s;overeign of the neigbouring coa&s;t; the effect of which dominion is that within it, every &s;overeign has a right <HI>to protect foreign commerce,</HI> as well as to
<PB N="22" REF="032226_0023_0FF1306677B4E8F8">&s;ecure his own territories from in&s;ult.</Q> How is fo|reign commerce to be protected within our dominion? Certainly by re&s;toring property taken there. In ex|tending our dominion only one league from the coa&s;t, we have gone only half as far as France goes her&s;elf: and yet &s;he accu&s;es us of breaking the treaty, becau&s;e we do not &s;uffer her privateers to take ve&s;&s;els on our &s;hores and even in our rivers.</P>
<P>The Marine ordinances of France, which are now in force, and which her commi&s;&s;ions to privateers require to be ob&s;erved, <Q>prohibit all her &s;ubjects from taking commi&s;&s;ions from foreign kings, princes or &s;tates, to arm ve&s;&s;els for war, or to crui&s;e at &s;ea under their colours, without expre&s;s permi&s;&s;ion, under pain of being treated as pirates.</Q> "The&s;e rules," &s;ays the commentary, <Q>have no exception; they extend to all commi&s;&s;ions from friends or allies, as well as neutrals, and include all Frenchmen, whether they dwell in France or in foreign countries; for Frenchmen are not le&s;s Frenchmen for having gone to live in foreign parts. <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Valin vol. 2. page 276.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>Thus, what has been long practi&s;ed and is now e&s;tabli&s;hed in France, we have done, and no more; and yet &s;he complains. We have forbidden our citizens to take commi&s;&s;ions from her, again&s;t nations with whom we are at peace, and as the only method of en|forcing this prohibition, we have re&s;tored property taken in contempt of it; and in all this, we have pre|ci&s;ely practi&s;ed her own rules. Yet &s;he charges us with breaking the treaty.</P>
<P>The whole &s;cope and tenor of her laws forbid ve&s;&s;els under foreign commi&s;&s;ions, from arming in her ports, again&s;t nations in peace with her. This we have al&s;o forbidden, after her example; and we have enforced the prohibition, by &s;topping and di&s;arming the ve&s;&s;els when in our power, and by re&s;toring the property which they had taken and brought into our country. And this France alledges as a breach of the treaty.</P>
<P>She next accu&s;es us of another infraction, in &s;uffering &s;hips of war of her enemies, which have made prizes on her citizens, to find an a&s;ylum in our ports.</P>

The treaty in article 17th provides, that <Q>no &s;helter or refuge &s;hall be given in the ports of either party. to &s;uch as &s;hall have made prize of the &s;ubjects, peo|ple or property, of the other</Q> and the 22d article for|bids <Q>foreign privateers, in enmity with one party, to &s;ell or exchange their &s;hips or prizes, in the ports of the other.</Q></P>
<P>Now it is clear, that nothing is expre&s;sly forbidden here, but the &s;ale or exchange of prizes, and the en|trance of &s;hips that had taken prizes; the prizes them|&s;elves, according to the literal con&s;truction, might be &s;ent in, tho' not &s;old; and this would have been a great advantage to the captors: This advantage the United States &s;uppo&s;ed, that the treaty did not intend to give to the enemies of France.</P>
<P>Be&s;ide if no Briti&s;h &s;hip of war, which had ever taken a French prize, could be admitted into our ports, how was the fact to be e&s;tabli&s;hed; the Briti&s;h might deny the fact: could we take it for granted, becau&s;e a&s;&s;erted by the French; or mu&s;t we in every ca&s;e, before we could &s;end off the ve&s;&s;el, in&s;titute a &s;uit to decide whe|ther at any time, or in any part of the world, &s;he had taken a French prize? This it is evident, would have been a &s;ubject of endle&s;s and vexatious contention.</P>
<P>Our government therefore adopted a con&s;truction more beneficial to France, more conformable to the &s;pi|rit of the treaty, and much ea&s;ier of execution. In|&s;tead of admitting prizes made on France by her ene|mies, and excluding all ve&s;&s;els which were charged with having made them, it re&s;olved to exclude the prizes in all ca&s;es, and to admit all &s;hips of war except &s;uch as might attempt to come in <HI>with their prizes,</HI> tho&s;e were to be, and have been excluded.</P>
<P>France complains of this con&s;truction, and calls it a breach of the treaty; &s;he does not recollect that if we were to adopt her con&s;truction, and follow the letter of the article, we &s;hould do her a much greater injury, by admitting all the prizes which her enemies might think &s;it to &s;end in.</P>
<P>Another breach of the treaty with which &s;he charges us, is that we have permitted Briti&s;h &s;hips to arm for war in our ports.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="032226_0025_0FF19A1A30C31FB0">
This charge is directly contrary to fact, the &s;tricte&s;t orders have always exi&s;ted again&s;t &s;uch armaments, and every attempt to make them, has been prevented as &s;oon as known to the government; two or three in&s;tanc|es have been mentioned, in which ve&s;&s;els armed and went out, before the government, or even the French mini&s;ter or con&s;uls, had information of it. But what could be done after the ve&s;&s;els were gone? had they returned, they would have been &s;eized; and their prizes, had they come within our power, would have been re&s;tored to the owners. But neither of tho&s;e ca&s;es happened; and I would a&s;k again, what could be done after the ve&s;&s;els were gone? Go to war, France would have &s;aid, to revenge the injury; this was her aim, and this &s;he did &s;ay, over and over, tho' not in expre&s;s words. But if acts like this, had been a proper rea&s;on for going to war, we ought to have attacked France her&s;elf long ago; for &s;he has attempted ten armaments, where the Engli&s;h have attempted one; and &s;everal of them, more|over, her mini&s;ter &s;ent to &s;ea, again&s;t the expre&s;s orders of the government, and in contempt of its authority.</P>
<P>As to the &s;ale of her prizes in our ports, for prevent|ing which, &s;he charges us with another infraction of the treaty, &s;he has by the treaty no &s;uch right: there is not one word &s;aid about her prizes; except that &s;he may bring them in and carry them away. This &s;he &s;ays, is the &s;ame thing as a permi&s;&s;ion to &s;ell; but common &s;en&s;e, and the plain meaning of words, &s;ay otherwi&s;e. Her own laws al&s;o, &s;ay otherwi&s;e; which notwith&s;tanding this treaty with us, expre&s;sly forbid the &s;ale of foreign prizes, in her ports.</P>
<P>We did indeed for a time, permit the &s;ale of her prizes in this country, as a matter of &s;pecial favour; but we &s;oon found this permi&s;&s;ion productive of many ill effects; our &s;ea ports having became the re&s;ort and &s;tation of privateers, who&s;e crews are generally among the mo&s;t profligate of mankind, were converted into &s;cenes of riot; many di&s;orders took place, our citizens were drawn off from their regular indu&s;try, and by the intro|duction of goods, under pretence of prize, frauds on the revenue began to be practi&s;ed. The permi&s;&s;ion therefore,
<PB N="25" REF="032226_0026_0FF19A1BCED42C50">was very properly revoked; the only &s;ubject of regret is, that it ever was granted.</P>
<P>The con&s;ular convention, comes next into view: this convention makes part of the treaties between us and France, and &s;he alledges that we have infringed it in two points.</P>
<P>The 12th article provides, that the con&s;uls of France and the United States, &s;hall po&s;&s;e&s;s the power of decid|ing, re&s;pectively, all differences which may ari&s;e between the people of one country in the territories of the other. We have never hindered the French con&s;uls from decid|ing all &s;uch controver&s;ies between French citizens; but the French government has lately found out, that we have pa&s;&s;ed no law to enable tho&s;e con&s;uls to enforce their deci&s;ions. It might be a&s;ked, why has this mat|ter re&s;ted in &s;ilence &s;o long? why has nothing been heard of this complaint till now; although the fact complained of, has exi&s;ted for more than eight years? We might remark on the extraordinary and unprece|dented nature of the complaint it&s;elf; whereby, con|trary to univer&s;al u&s;age and the fir&s;t principles of na|tional &s;overeignty, a government is required to put compul&s;ory proce&s;s into the hands of per&s;ons not amen|able to its laws, for the purpo&s;e of enforcing deci&s;ions not under the controul of its judiciary authority: But it will be &s;ufficient to ob&s;erve, that France her&s;elf has never pa&s;&s;ed, or been required by us to pa&s;s, any &s;uch laws as &s;he demands from us; and that it mo&s;t evident|ly appears, from the convention it&s;elf, that no &s;uch laws, were ever intended to take place in either coun|try; &s;ince the decrees of the con&s;uls are to be enforced again&s;t the parties by their own governments re&s;pec|tively; to who&s;e courts the right of appeal, and of cour&s;e the power of rever&s;ing, confirming, and executing the decrees, is expre&s;sly and &s;olely re&s;erved.</P>
<P>Another article of this convention authori&s;es the con&s;uls of each nation re&s;pectively, to cau&s;e the de&s;ert|ing &s;ailors of their nation, to be arre&s;ted and delivered to the captains, on application to a magi&s;trate of the country, and the production of proof. The French go|vernment has lately found out, that our magi&s;trates when applied to for the arre&s;t of their &s;ailors, require
<PB N="26" REF="032226_0027_0FF19A21C4EDCF70">the original articles to be produced. Tho&s;e articles contain the agreement of the &s;ailors and are &s;igned by them. They remain on board the &s;hip, and are the only authentic document by which any di&s;pute between the captain and &s;ailors can be decided. It is an inva|riable and mo&s;t excellent maxim of our laws, that no copy of a paper can be produced in evidence, e&s;peci|ally where life or liberty is to be effected by it, unle&s;s the paper it&s;elf be proved to be de&s;troyed, or in the power of the other party. In conformity to this max|im, our maje&s;trates very properly require, that the original articles them&s;elves &s;hould be produced to prove that a man belongs to the &s;hip, before they will arre&s;t him for de&s;erting from it;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The convention it&s;elf al&s;o expre&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> requires, that the orginal roll, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"></NOTE> of this the French govern|ment, after eight years &s;ilence, has at length bethought it&s;elf to complain. It calls this a breach of the con|&s;ular convention, and alledges, that copies of the ar|ticles, certified from the con&s;uls office, ought to be received; although it is mo&s;t evident from the &s;lighte&s;t view of the con&s;ular convention, that the copies whereof it &s;peaks, are wholly of a different kind, and to be u&s;ed for a different purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>I have explained the&s;e two points thus particularly, not from a belief that they are of the lea&s;t weight or importance, even in the eyes of France her&s;elf; but to &s;hew with what eagerne&s;s &s;he catches at the mo&s;t futile accu&s;ations again&s;t this country.</P>
<P>The la&s;t accu&s;ation under the head of breaking trea|ties, is, if po&s;&s;ible, more extraordinary than any of the former. France accu&s;es us of having broken the 19th article of the treaty, by permitting a public &s;hip of war belonging to the republic, to be arre&s;ted in one of our ports for an act done on the high &s;eas. Would it be believed, that this &s;hip, arre&s;ted by proce&s;s of the courts, at the in&s;tance of a citizen, and for a mo&s;t re|prehen&s;ible act, had been actually relea&s;ed by the in|terference of the executive, on the expre&s;s ground, that being a public &s;hip of war, &s;he was potected by the treaty? yet &s;uch is the fact. Complaint being made of
<PB N="27" REF="032226_0028_0FF19A24C41C1408">her arre&s;t by the French mini&s;ter, the executive direct|ed the attorney general to file the nece&s;&s;ary proceed|ings in the court for obtaining her relea&s;e. He did &s;o, and after hearing the ca&s;e &s;he was relea&s;ed; but as the forms of the court, the priority of other bu&s;ine&s;s, and the cour&s;e of proceedings, did not admit of a deci&s;ion &s;o &s;peedy as Mr. Adet de&s;ired, he refu&s;ed to accept the ve&s;&s;el after &s;he was relea&s;ed, and declared that he would abandon her to the government, and claim damages. The&s;e damages have never been refu&s;ed, nor even demanded; and yet becau&s;e the pre|&s;ident would not undertake at the in&s;tance of a foreign mini&s;ter, to overrule the courts of ju&s;tice, who&s;e in|dependence is expre&s;ly &s;ecured by the con&s;titution, be|cau&s;e he would not with a &s;trong hand arre&s;t their pro|ceedings, and in open defiance of the con&s;titution and the laws, wre&s;t from their hands the object of their deliberations; we are accu&s;ed of having broken our treaty with France! we are charged with an arre&s;t, which in&s;tead of &s;anctioning; we cau&s;ed to be remov|ed; we are charged with breaking a treaty by an act which we redre&s;&s;ed!</P>
<P>Such are the grounds whereon for four years together, and in terms the mo&s;t di&s;re&s;pectful, we have been un|cea&s;ingly charged with violation of treaties!</P>
<P>But we have refu&s;ed, &s;he &s;ays, to enter into a new and more exten&s;ive treaty with her. She &s;ays, that under "the mo&s;t frivolous pretexts,"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Mr. Adet's note.</NOTE> we have evaded all her advances to a new negociation. This al&s;o is an accu&s;ation again&s;t us, made by the mini&s;ter Genet, and which Mr. Adet has renewed and enforced.</P>
<P>But had we not a right, without offending France, to decline a new treaty if we thought it would not &s;uit us? We already had a treaty; was it a ground of quar|rel that we were &s;atisfied with it? Why was a new treaty propo&s;ed? For our benefit; if &s;o we were the proper judges how far it was beneficial. For the be|nefit of France? In that ca&s;e we certainly had a right to decide, how far the advantage which &s;he de&s;ired was
<PB N="28" REF="032226_0029_0FF19A2653F43720">compatible with our own intere&s;ts. Who ever heard, that to decline an advantageous bargain our&s;elves, or refu&s;e one to another per&s;on, was a cau&s;e of of|fence?</P>
<P>The truth however is, that we did not decline this negociation; we did not wi&s;h it indeed, but our go|vernment was willing to hear what France had to &s;ay on the &s;ubject, and frequently expre&s;&s;ed its willingne&s;s. The propo&s;ition was fir&s;t made by Mr. Genet, in May 1793, but Mr. Jeffer&s;on, at that time &s;ecretary of &s;tate, informed him, that the bu&s;ine&s;s could not be entered on immediately, becau&s;e the &s;enate was not in &s;e&s;&s;ion. He renewed the &s;ubject the September following, but before that time he had behaved &s;o much ami&s;s, that the government had reque&s;ted his recall, and did not think fit to communicate with him, except on matters of immediate and pre&s;&s;ing nece&s;&s;ity; it therefore po|litely waved the bu&s;ine&s;s, with an a&s;&s;urance <Q>that it &s;hould be con&s;idered, with all the re&s;pect and in|tere&s;t which its object nece&s;&s;arily required.</Q></P>
<P>His &s;ucce&s;&s;or, Mr. Fauchet, never mentioned the new negociation; the next that we heard of it was from Mr. Adet, in June 1795. The pre&s;ident immediately met his advances, and directed the &s;ecretary of &s;tate to enter on the negociation without delay. He inform|ed Mr. Adet of this, and propo&s;ed a mode of proceed|ing; Mr. Adet promi&s;ed to enter on the bu&s;ine&s;s, but he po&s;tponed it from time to time, on the plea of in|di&s;po&s;ition or bu&s;ine&s;s, and it was finally <HI>dropt by him&s;elf.</HI></P>
<P>And yet Mr. Adet &s;ays, <Q>that his offers to treat were evaded, under the mo&s;t frivolous pretexts.</Q></P>
<P>But although our government was willing, and even de&s;irous to hear what France had to propo&s;e on the &s;ub|ject of a new treaty, it could not have agreed to one on the terms which &s;he held out, without &s;acrificing the be&s;t intere&s;ts of this country.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e terms are to be found in Mr. Genet's in&s;truc|tions, by which Mr. Adet, when pre&s;&s;ed on the &s;ubject, declared that he al&s;o was to be guided; and from tho&s;e in&s;tructions it appears undeniably, that our joining France in the war, engaging to defend her iands, and
<PB N="29" REF="032226_0030_0FF19A2809171A48">forming an alliance offen&s;ive and defen&s;ive, were to be e&s;&s;ential conditions of the new treaty; an exten&s;ion of commercial priviledges with the i&s;lands, was the lure thrown out to us.</P>
<P>The in&s;tructions begin with declaring, <Q>that the executive council have highly approved the overtures made to a former mini&s;ter, by the American go|vernment, on the means of renewing and con&s;oli|dating the commercial treaties between the two countries, and are di&s;po&s;ed to &s;et on foot a new ne|gociation on tho&s;e foundations&mdash;that they do not know but that &s;uch a treaty admits a latitude <HI>&s;till more exten&s;ive</HI> in becoming a <HI>national agreement,</HI> in which two great nations &s;hall &s;u&s;pend, (that is ac|cording to the French expre&s;&s;ion, &s;hall clo&s;ely unite) their <HI>political</HI> and commercial intere&s;ts, and e&s;tabli&s;h a mutual under&s;tanding <HI>to befriend the empire of liberty wherever it can be embraced to guarantee the &s;overeignty of the people, and to puni&s;h tho&s;e powers who &s;till keep up an exclu&s;ive colonial and commercial &s;y&s;tem,</HI> by declaring that their ve&s;&s;els &s;hall not be received in the ports of the contracting parties.</Q> <Q>Such a pact, they add, will quickly contribute to the general emancipation of the new world.</Q></P>
<P>This "general emancipation of the new world," we know was to include the liberation of the &s;laves, whom this very French government &s;oon after &s;et free in its i&s;lands.</P>
<P>"Be&s;ides the advantages," continue the in&s;tructions, <Q>which humanity in general will draw from the &s;uc|ce&s;s of &s;uch a negociation, <HI>we</HI> (the French) have at this moment, a <HI>particular intere&s;t</HI> in taking &s;teps to act efficaciou&s;ly again&s;t England and Spain, if, as every thing announces, tho&s;e powers &s;hould attack us. In this &s;ituation of affairs, we ought to <HI>excite by all po&s;&s;ible means, the zeal of the Americans,</HI> who are as much intere&s;ted as our&s;elves in di&s;concerting the de|&s;tructive projects of George third; the executive council has room to believe, that the&s;e rea&s;ons, in addition to the <HI>great commercial advantages,</HI> which we are di&s;po&s;ed to concede to the United States, will determine their government, to adhere to all that citizen Genet &s;hall propo&s;e to them on our
<PB N="30" REF="032226_0031_0FF19A2B11164480">part&mdash;and the executive charges him, <HI>in expectation that the American government will finally make a com|mon cau&s;e with us,</HI> to take &s;uch &s;teps as exigencies may require.</Q></P>
<P>Hence it manife&s;tly appears, that we were to make a <HI>common cau&s;e</HI> with France for her intere&s;t, again&s;t Great Britain and Spain, and that <HI>commercial advantages</HI> were to be our wages. Sub&s;equent parts of the in&s;tructions are &s;till more explicit.</P>
<P><Q>The Executive Council recommends it e&s;pecially to Citizen Genet, to &s;ound early the di&s;po&s;ition of the American Government, and to make it (the guarantee of their I&s;lands) a condition <HI>&s;ine qua non</HI> of their free commerce with the We&s;t-Indies, &s;o e&s;&s;en|tial to the United States. It nearly concerns the peace and pro&s;perity of the French Nation, that a people, who&s;e re&s;ources increa&s;e beyond all calcu|lation, and whom nature has placed &s;o near our rich colonies, &s;hould be intere&s;ted, by their own engage|ments, in the pre&s;ervations of the&s;e I&s;lands. Citizen Genet will find the le&s;s difficulty in making this propo&s;ition reli&s;hed in the United States, as the great trade which will be the reward of it, will <HI>indemnify them ultimately</HI> for the <HI>&s;acrifices</HI> which they may make in the out&s;et, and we &s;hall immediately put our&s;elves in a condition to fulfil our engage|ments, by &s;ending to the American ports a &s;ufficient force to put them beyond in&s;ult, and to facilitate their intercour&s;e with the I&s;lands and with France.</Q></P>
<P>I have been the more full and particular in citing the&s;e in&s;tructions, becau&s;e they not only prove, incon|te&s;tibly, what were to be the conditions of the new treaty propo&s;ed to us by France, but al&s;o that her project, from the beginning of the war, was to draw us into it. We &s;hall pre&s;ently &s;ee that altho' &s;he recalled Mr. Genet, &s;he neither di&s;approved his mea&s;ures nor abandoned this project.</P>
<P>That the refu&s;al of our government to enter into a new treaty on the&s;e terms, &s;hould have been matter of di&s;plea&s;ure and vexation to France, is perfectly natural; becau&s;e it di&s;concerted one of her mo&s;t favorite &s;chemes: but none of its mea&s;ures have either merited or receiv|ed,
<PB N="31" REF="032226_0032_0FF19A2DF9B36490">more warmly or more univer&s;ully, the approbation and thanks of this country.</P>
<P>And yet France has made it one of her charges again&s;t us, that we have evaded this new treaty <Q>under the mo&s;t frivolous pretexts.</Q>!</P>
<P>She has gone further. She has accu&s;ed us of having <Q>eluded her friendly offers of a&s;&s;i&s;tance in our nego|ciations with Algiers.</Q></P>
<P>Here again I would a&s;k, whether we had not a right to decline her mediation in this bu&s;ine&s;s, if we thought fit? Are we to make no treaties without not only con&s;ulting France, but employing al&s;o her a&s;&s;i&s;tance? &s;hould one of my neighbours offer to interfere in com|po&s;ing a difference between me and another, &s;urely I might decline his interference without giving him cau&s;e of offence? He might think it very unfriendly, or very unwi&s;e; but &s;urely it would not authorize him to quar|rel with me.</P>
<P>The truth however is, that far from "eluding" this friendly offer of France, we &s;hewed the utmo&s;t readi|ne&s;s, and even inclination, to avail our&s;elves of it to the utmo&s;t. Our mini&s;ter in Portugal, to whom the Algerine negociation was entru&s;ted, went fir&s;t to Paris, "in order to engage the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the French go|vernment," in the mean time, he &s;ent an agent imme|diately to Algiers to pave the way; and as the Alge|rines are known to be a very fickle, capricious people, difficult to be managed, and capable of being dealt with at particular times only, he furni&s;hed this agent with proper powers, that he might avail him&s;elf of any fa|vourable moment which &s;hoeld chance to offer; &s;uch a moment did offer very &s;oon after his arrival: he &s;eiz|ed it, and concluded a treaty, di&s;agreeable indeed, but far better than none, and more favourable than Algi|ers has lately, if ever, made with any other country.</P>
<P>Ought he to have lo&s;t this moment in waiting for the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of France? Before the orders from France could arrive, the opportunity might have pa&s;&s;ed away, never to return.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides; our agent, who concluded the treaty, de|clares that neither France, nor her con&s;ul, had the lea&s;t intere&s;t with the Algerine government at that time. It was for this rea&s;on, he &s;ays, that he did not reque&s;t the
<PB N="32" REF="032226_0033_0FF19A30F0A05958">a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the French con&s;ul; which would have only injured the cau&s;e. But he applied for this a&s;&s;i&s;tance in negociating with the other Barbary States, where the French were &s;uppo&s;ed to po&s;&s;e&s;s influence.</P>
<P>So much for this complaint: the bitterne&s;s with which it is urged, gives &s;ome ground to &s;u&s;pect, that her an|ger does not ari&s;e from our having made a treaty with|out her a&s;&s;i&s;tance, but from our having made one at all; and that her interference was intended to prevent, not to promote the object. It is very difficult to believe that the freedom of our flag, and the exten&s;ion of our commerce, in the Mediterranean, can be de&s;irable ob|jects to her, or to any other commercial power.</P>
<P>She charges us further, with having authori&s;ed, or permitted, various infractions of our neutrality by the Engli&s;h, or in their favour.</P>
<P>One of the&s;e infractions is the impre&s;&s;ment of our &s;eamen by Briti&s;h &s;hips of war; we have not adopted, &s;he &s;ays, or at lea&s;t <HI>have not made known to her,</HI> any ef|ficatious mea&s;ures for repelling this violence; whereby her enemies are &s;uffered to &s;upport and increa&s;e their maritime forces, from among our citizens.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place, we have adopted &s;uch mea&s;ures as we judged mo&s;t efficacious for this purpo&s;e; and tho&s;e mea&s;ures being public, were known to France. Our government has, at all times, re&s;i&s;ted the impre&s;s|ment of our &s;eamen, by every means &s;hort of ho&s;tility; and early in the year 1796, before this complaint was made, Congre&s;s pa&s;&s;ed an act, for the &s;ole purpo&s;e of protecting and relieving American &s;eamen from im|pre&s;&s;ment. The&s;e mea&s;ures indeed, were not &s;uch as France wi&s;hed, and probably hoped to &s;ee adopted; for they were calculated to produce the effect <HI>without ho&s;tility:</HI> but they were &s;uch as our own government, to whom, and not to France, we have entru&s;ted the protection of our citizens, con&s;idered as the mo&s;t ad|vi&s;able.</P>
<P>As to our not having informed France of the&s;e mea|&s;ures, it is not true; &s;he did not need information of a public law, which was printed in the new&s;papers; and &s;he knew that other mea&s;ures were pur&s;ued, tho' &s;he &s;aid that they were not <HI>efficacious;</HI> we well know what
<PB N="33" REF="032226_0034_0FF19A32BA785E58">we means by <HI>efficacious</HI> mea&s;ures; but on this point, we and not France, were the proper judges.</P>
<P>And let me be permitted to a&s;k, what obligation we were under to inform France of our mea&s;ures? Is &s;he to pre&s;cribe to us in what manner our citizens are to be protected! If under pretence, that the <HI>inefficacious</HI> manner in which we conduct our affairs, operates to her injury, &s;he may direct and controul us, there is an end of our independence. This complaint is of a piece with that of Mr. Genet again&s;t the Pre&s;ident, "for refu&s;ing to convene Congre&s;s at his in&s;tance."</P>
<P>We have al&s;o, &s;he &s;ays, re&s;trained our citizens from receiving commi&s;&s;ions from her, or &s;erving on board of her armed ve&s;&s;els.</P>
<P>We have indeed done &s;o, and it was our duty; a duty enjoined by our own peace and &s;afety, and by the impartial ju&s;tice which we wi&s;hed to ob&s;erve towards other nations. We never objected to our citizens going to France, and engaging in her &s;ervice, which many of them did; but we objected to their receiving com|mi&s;&s;ions from her in our own country, or entering on board of her privateers, to rob tho&s;e who were coming peaceably to trade with us. This was conformably to prudence, as well as ju&s;tice; and it was, moreover, what we had &s;tipulated with her to do, and to the ut|mo&s;t of our power had done, in the ca&s;e of her enemies.</P>
<P>It is worth while to remark the incon&s;i&s;tency of the&s;e two complaints. She fir&s;t quarrels with us, becau&s;e we could not prevent, in her own words <Q>the marine of England from being augmented by our &s;eamen,</Q> and in the &s;ame breath, &s;he accu&s;es us of infringing the laws of neutrality, by prohibiting our &s;eamen to &s;erve in her privateers! We forbad both, and as far as we could, we prevented both; but unfortunately, it was not always in our power to prevent either; and yet &s;he quarrels with us, for not preventing, even by ho&s;tility, in the ca&s;e of her enemies, the &s;ame thing, which &s;he al&s;o quarrels with us, for having attempted to prevent in her own ca&s;e! &s;uch is the ju&s;tice, mode|ration, and impartiality of France!</P>
<P>We are al&s;o charged with permitting the Engli&s;h to violate our neutrality, by capturing French property on
<PB N="34" REF="032226_0035_0FF19A370D5B8670">board of our &s;hips; and even American property when bound to, or from the ports of France.</P>
<P>As to the capture of French property on board of our &s;hips, it has already appeared to be a right which Britain po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es by the laws of neutrality. How then can the permi&s;&s;ion of its exerci&s;e be a breach of them? But we never did willingly permit its exerci&s;e. We acquie&s;ed in it indeed, becau&s;e we knew that the right exi&s;ted, which the Engli&s;h, notwith&s;tanding all our en|deavours, could not be induced to relinqui&s;h. Had it been in our power to induce her, we mo&s;t certainly would have done &s;o; for of all things, next to keeping out of the war, it was what we mo&s;t de&s;ired, and what would mo&s;t effectually have promoted our intere&s;ts.</P>
<P>But France &s;ays, that our mea&s;ures for this purpo&s;e, were not <HI>efficacious;</HI> and when &s;he &s;ays &s;o, we well know what &s;he means. The in&s;tructions to Mr. Genet, and the whole tenor of her conduct, leave no doubt on that point.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the capture of American property, bound to or from French ports, we were &s;o far from <HI>permitting</HI> it, that after remon&s;trating in the firme&s;t manner, tho' not in terms of outrage and in&s;ult, we demanded &s;atisfaction, and armed to enforce it; and had not the mea&s;ure been di&s;continued, and reparation agreed on, there is no doubt that war would have been the con&s;equence. That we accepted this reparation, that we did not fall into her views, <HI>by making war in the fir&s;t in&s;tance,</HI> is the true cau&s;e of offence which we have given to France.</P>
<P>Another breach of neutraltiy with which &s;he charges us, is <Q>that we &s;uffered the Briti&s;h to declare her I&s;lands in a &s;tate of blockade.</Q>!</P>
<P>But I would a&s;k, how we were to prevent this decla|ration? Or how we were bound to prevent it, had we been able? France does not pretend that we were bound by treaty; the treaty of alliance indeed, &s;tipu|lates for a guarantee of her i&s;lands; but the treaty of alliance was purely defen&s;ive, not offen&s;ive; and it being perfectly certain, that &s;he was the aggre&s;&s;or in the war with England, the guarantee in this in&s;tance could not operate. But we were bound, &s;he &s;ays, by
<PB N="35" REF="032226_0036_0FF19A39F999E150">the laws of neutrality. How! can the laws of neu|trality oblige us to defend the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of our neigh|bours? This would amount to &s;aying, that neutrality required us to enter into the war.</P>
<P>We know that by the law of nations, provi&s;ions can|not be carried to a blockaded place. The Briti&s;h de|clared, <Q>that certain French i&s;lands were blockaded, and that all per&s;ons attempting to carry provi&s;ions to them, &s;hould be dealt with <HI>according to the law</HI> of <HI>nations.</HI> While they adhered to this declaration, and dealt with us <HI>according to the low of rations.</HI></Q> we had no right to complain; whenever, under colour of the declaration, they infringed the law of nations, they have engaged to make reparation, and are pur&s;uing the mo&s;t effectual mea&s;ures for fulfilling the engagement.</P>
<P>In the mean time, as the&s;e blockaded i&s;lands were prevented from receiving provi&s;ions, France &s;uffered an injury; but it was an injury which we could not pre|vent; for we had no fleet to drive away the Engli&s;h &s;hips which formed the blockade. Even had we po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed a fleet, it would not have been incumbent on us to engage in a war, merely to &s;ave one of our neigh|bours from an inconvenience. We al&s;o &s;uffered an injury; reparation for which we demanded, and are to receive.</P>
<P>Her next complaint, with which the long catalogue is terminated, re&s;ts on an outrage offered to Mr. Fau|chet, a former French mini&s;ter, by a Briti&s;h &s;hip of war in the waters of the United States; and which, &s;he &s;ays, we have &s;uffered to pa&s;s with impunity.</P>
<P>The outrage offered to Mr. Fauchet, was an attempt to &s;eize his per&s;on and papers, on board of a ve&s;&s;el in which he had taken his pa&s;&s;age from New York to Rhode-I&s;land. The attempt was made by a Briti&s;h &s;hip of war, lying near Newport in Rhode-I&s;land. The ve&s;|&s;el was &s;topt, and the trunks of Mr. Fauchets atten|dants were &s;earched, he and his papers e&s;caped, becau&s;e having been informed of the de&s;ign, he went a&s;hore, and proceeded to Newport by land: perceiving that they had mi&s;&s;ed their prey, the Briti&s;h party relea&s;ed the ve&s;&s;el and tho&s;e on board.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="032226_0037_0FF19A3B8EA9B538">
When the Pre&s;ident heard of this daring in&s;ult to our country, he felt and expre&s;&s;ed a proper indigna|tion; but as he received the information from one party only, prudence no le&s;s than ju&s;tice, required that before he acted, he &s;hould hear the other &s;ide. He accordingly directed enquiries to be made; having ful|ly a&s;certained the facts, he ordered the Briti&s;h man of war to depart immediately from our harbours, and di|rected that in ca&s;e of her di&s;obedience for more than forty eight hours, all intercour&s;e between her and the country would be cut off. Our mini&s;ter at London was in&s;tructed to complain again&s;t the Captain, and demand his puni&s;hment; this was done, but the Cap|tain with his &s;hip, was in Nova Scotia, from whence he went to the We&s;t Indies. He lately returned to England, and as &s;oon as it was known, the mini&s;ter was ordered to renew his demand.</P>
<P>What could we do more? we could not &s;eize him on board of his &s;hip to puni&s;h him? we could not fol|low him to Nova Scotia, the We&s;t Indies, or England to puni&s;h him. If the Briti&s;h government &s;hould ne|glect to puni&s;h him, &s;hall we declare war again&s;t them to avenge this injury? even France perhaps might al|low, that this would be to buy vengeance at too dear a rate.</P>
<P>This is what France calls "&s;uffering the in&s;ult to her mini&s;ter to pa&s;s with impunity!" and yet much greater lenity was exerci&s;ed, when her con&s;ul at Bo&s;ton, with an armed force, re&s;cued a ve&s;&s;el from the officers of ju&s;tice; and when one of Mr. Genet's illegal priva|teers re&s;i&s;ted the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e offieers, and the militia &s;ent by the Pre&s;ident to arre&s;t her in the Delaware, and proceeded to &s;ea in defiance of his authority.</P>
<P>Such my fellow-citizens, is a true picture of French grievances! Such are the injuries for which we have been &s;ubjected, during four yeass, to the importunate and in&s;ulting remon&s;trances of three &s;ucce&s;&s;ive mini&s;|ters! for which we have been accu&s;ed of making <Q>an <HI>in&s;idious</HI> proclamation of neutrality,</Q> of <Q>&s;acrificing France to her enemies, and <HI>pro&s;tituting</HI> our own rights to Great Britain,</Q> of permitting <Q>by a <HI>perfi|dious complai&s;ance,</HI> the Engli&s;h to violate rights which

<P>It is, in fine, for &s;uch injuries as the&s;e, that our treaty with France has been expre&s;sly violated, that &s;warms of privateers have been let loo&s;e upon our com|merce, that our property to the amount of many mil|lions of dollars has been plundered, that hundreds of our &s;hips have been &s;eized and condemned, multitudes of our &s;ailors thrown into jails and pri&s;on &s;hips, that our &s;eamen who may be found in Bri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;h &s;hips of war, altho' brought there by <HI>compul&s;ion,</HI> are declared liable to be condemned as pirates;<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">b a late decree of the Directory.</NOTE> and, to fill up the mea&s;ure of outrage, that a me&s;&s;enger of peace and conciliation, a mini&s;ter expre&s;sly "&s;ent to explain our conduct, to <Q>remove mi&s;under&s;tandings, and re&s;tore harmony,</Q> has been contemptuou&s;ly driven away, without a reception or a hearing!</P>
<P>Having taken this view of the injuries complained of by France, permit me now fellow citizens, to make &s;ome remarks on her preten&s;ions; permit me to trace a little the con&s;equences o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> a compliance with her demands; the nature and extent of the terms to which &s;he requires us to &s;ubmit.</P>
<P>This &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, it mu&s;t be remembered, is to precede any explanation on our part, or even the reception of a mini&s;ter. The directory told gen. Pinckney, through Mr. Munroe, that France would receive no mini&s;ter plenipotentiary from the United States, till all the inju|ries whereof &s;he had complained and of which &s;he had a right to expect redre&s;s, &s;hould fir&s;t fully receive it</P>
<P>The fir&s;t of the&s;e injuries is the Briti&s;h treaty, which &s;he declares to be a violation of her's, and a departure in us from the principles of neutrality. This injury mu&s;t be redre&s;&s;ed; therefore the treaty, though &s;ancti|oned by every branch of the government, and executed in part, mu&s;t be broken: the po&s;ts which have been given up under it, mu&s;t be re-delivered; the pro&s;pects of reimbur&s;ement for their lo&s;&s;es which it affords to
<PB N="39" REF="032226_0040_0FF19A48CA55EF60">our merchants, mu&s;t be renounced, and the commi&s;|&s;ioners now employed in deciding on their claims, mu&s;t b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> recalled. In fine, our whole di&s;pute with Great Britain mu&s;t be renewed under circum&s;tances of the highe&s;t aggravation, and we mu&s;t be left to &s;ettle it by a new treaty under the direction of France, or by a war in her alliance.</P>
<P>Without all this it is mo&s;t evident, that the injuries of which France complains under this treaty, cannot be redre&s;&s;ed, and &s;he requires them to be redre&s;&s;ed before &s;he will even hear our explanation.</P>
<P>She next complains again&s;t the deci&s;ion of our courts. The con&s;tructions put upon our treaties, and upon the laws of nations by our courts, &s;he complains of as injuries, which, like the others, mu&s;t be redre&s;&s;ed before &s;he will li&s;ten to us.</P>
<P>Therefore the deci&s;ions of our courts, wherever &s;he complains of them, and that is in every ca&s;e where they have been adver&s;e to her claims, mu&s;t be rever&s;ed. How is this to be done? Tho&s;e deci&s;ions have been carried by appeals into the &s;upreme courts of the Union, and there confirmed. The judicial power is indepen|dent of the legi&s;lative and executive by the expre&s;s terms of our con&s;titution, which to render the courts more completely independent, provides that the judges &s;hall not be di&s;placed, like other officers, at the plea|&s;ure of the pre&s;ident, but &s;hall hold their places till turned our by impeachment. In the mean time there is no power in the government by which their deci&s;ions can be altered. France, however, informs us, that they mu&s;t be altered before &s;he will li&s;ten to us.</P>
<P>It is plain therefore, that in order to &s;atisfy her, we mu&s;t violate our con&s;titution in its mo&s;t valuable part, the independence of the judicial power.</P>
<P>And this is not all, we mu&s;t place the&s;e courts hereafter under the controul of her mini&s;ter, and re&s;train them from taking cognizance of any cau&s;es which he may pronounce improper for their interfe|rence; for France complains not only of the deci&s;ions of our courts, but of their creating delay to her pri|vateers, by taking cognizance of ca&s;es which have fi|nally been decided in her favour.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="032226_0041_0FF19A4A73FD2C70">
Therefore our courts having i&s;&s;ued proce&s;s to bring a cau&s;e before them on the complaint of our citizens, mu&s;t di&s;mi&s;s it on the orders of a French mini&s;ter. Should they refu&s;e to di&s;mi&s;s it, what then is to be done? The executive mu&s;t interfere with a &s;trong hand and over-rule them, and this not from his own judg|ment, but at the in&s;tance of a French mini&s;ter. Thus the public force of our country mu&s;t be placed in the hands of a foreign agent, to be employed in compell|ing our courts of ju&s;tice to &s;ubmit to his orders.</P>
<P>This is the very lowe&s;t &s;tage of dependence and de|gradation; and it is manife&s;t, that this mu&s;t be done be|fore the demands of France can be &s;atisfied; for there is no other method of preventing that interference of our courts whereof &s;he complains as one of her greate&s;t injuries.</P>
<P>The legi&s;lature mu&s;t al&s;o &s;hare in this degradation. It mu&s;t be compelled to repeal one of its laws; for one of them, the act of June 5, 1794, unfortunately con|firms the principles which had been adopted by our-courts and by the executive. This act accordingly is placed by France in the catalogue of her injuries, and mu&s;t be repealed.</P>
<P>Therefore the legi&s;lature mu&s;t hereafter a&s;k France what laws it &s;hall enact, and what, being already en|acted, it &s;hall &s;uffer to remain; for it is evident that if &s;he can in&s;i&s;t on the repeal of one law on the pre|tence of its being injurious to her intere&s;ts, or contrary to her rights, &s;he may equally object to the continu|ance or the pa&s;&s;ing of any other, there being none to which this pretence may not be extended.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">France has taken care to give us an example of the manner in which it may be extended, and in which &s;he would exe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ci&s;e this right, were we weak enough to concede it.

When the&s;e obnoxious deci&s;ions and laws &s;hall be removed, then will France enter into the exerci&s;e of tho&s;e rights, which through them have hitherto, as &s;he alledges, been unju&s;tly withheld from her. She will give commi&s;&s;ions to our citizens in our own ports to privateer again&s;t her enemies with whom we are at peace. The&s;e privateers, if they plea&s;e, will capture ve&s;&s;els on our coa&s;ts, in our rivers, and even at our wharves, and our courts will be prevented from giving redre&s;s.

<P>All this is the plain and nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence of complying with her demands.</P>
<P>Having proceeded thus far, we mu&s;t go on to de|clare war again&s;t England, or at lea&s;t to exclude her commerce from our ports, for the prevention and a|vengement of what France tells us are infractions of our neutrality and in&s;ults to our honour. France tells us, that we have heretofore &s;ubmitted to the&s;e in&s;ults, and winked at the&s;e infractions; that our mea&s;ures to repel or redre&s;s them, have been <HI>inefficacious,</HI> and the inconvenience which &s;he &s;uffers from this inefficacy, is numbered among the greate&s;t of her injuries.</P>
<P>It has already been &s;een, that the&s;e infractions and in|&s;ults con&s;i&s;t chiefly in the capture of French property in our ve&s;&s;els, that is in the exerci&s;e of a right which we acknowledge, and the law of nations clearly &s;upports.

But if it were otherwi&s;e; if as France a&s;&s;erts, all the acts complained of were really infractions, and we had failed to obtain &s;atisfaction, &s;till it is evident that the mea&s;ures which we have adopted for that pur|po&s;e, were the mo&s;t efficacious in our power &s;hort of ho&s;tility, or what would have immediately led to it.

<PB N="43" REF="032226_0044_0FF19A54D6036BF8">courts under the controul of her agents, violate your con&s;titution at her orders, and tamely allow her mini&s;|ter, under the pretence of watching over the execution of a treaty, and of inforcing the laws of neutrality, to over-rule the legi&s;lature, dictate to the Pre&s;ident, and a&s;&s;ume the ab&s;olute direction of your affairs? If you be thus prepared, which I will never believe till I &s;ee it, I freely, nay proudly, declare to you that I am not, and that my voice &s;hall never &s;anction this &s;urrender of our rights and independence. Sooner would I &s;ee every &s;hip &s;unk, every town in a&s;hes, and deva&s;tation once more &s;pread from one end our coa&s;t to the other.</P>
<P>With the lo&s;s of the&s;e things we might retain our &s;oil, our hands, our courage, our independent &s;pirit, and our con&s;titution; and we &s;hould be a nation &s;till. Indu&s;try would again give us &s;hips and towns; again might commerce gladden our ports, and agriculture &s;mile over our land; and our children po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing in peace and honour, the ble&s;&s;ings which with &s;o many &s;acrifices, we had purcha&s;ed, might proudly look on our graves, and &s;ay, "the&s;e were our fathers." But independence once lo&s;t, is mo&s;t rarely regained: Such is the condi|tion of our nature, that a nation once fallen, once re|duced under foreign rule, mo&s;t rarely ri&s;es again; and where its fall proceeds, as in our ca&s;e it mu&s;t, not from its want of means, but its want of courage to u&s;e them, from its pu&s;illanimity, its intrin&s;ic weakne&s;s of character, it is de&s;tined never more to &s;hake off the yoke.</P>
<P>But it may be &s;aid, is not this picture exaggerated? Can it be &s;uppo&s;ed that France, even &s;hould we yield to her pre&s;ent demands, would attempt to pu&s;h thus far her abu&s;e of our conce&s;&s;ions?</P>
<P>Let us enquire of the Dutch, let us a&s;k the Bel|gians, they can give us &s;ome u&s;eful information; and from their example, we may learn that the oppre&s;&s;ions of France always keep pace with the weakne&s;s, the credulity, and the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive &s;pirit of tho&s;e with whom &s;he has to deal. Let us a&s;k the Swi&s;s; from them we may receive a le&s;&s;on equally important, that the only
<PB N="44" REF="032226_0045_0FF19A5681B7C608">means of &s;etting bounds to her unju&s;t and haughty pre|ten&s;ions, is a firm and manly oppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>In the winter of 1794, the French armies having overrun Belgium, and being favored by the inten&s;e cold, which covered the rivers with Ice, marched into Holland. On the 20th of January, a few days after their arrival, the French commi&s;&s;ioners with the army, publi&s;hed a proclamation, in which they told the Dutch, <Q>In the mid&s;t of war, we con&s;ider you as our friends and allies; it is under this name that we enter your country, we &s;eek not to terrify, but to in&s;pire you with confidence. It is but a few years &s;ince a ty|rannic conqueror pre&s;cribed you laws; we aboli&s;h them, and re&s;tore you freedom.</Q></P>
<P><Q>We come not to make you &s;laves, the French na|tion &s;hall pre&s;erve to you your independence.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Per&s;onal &s;afety &s;hall be &s;ecured, and property pro|tected.</Q></P>
<P>All this was very friendly, and the Dutch very good naturedly believed it, more e&s;pecially as the French generals, when they were approaching the country, had con&s;tantly repeated the &s;ame thing. They however &s;oon found their mi&s;take.</P>
<P>Seven days after this fir&s;t proclamation, the &s;ame com|mi&s;&s;ioners, having now been admitted into all the towns with their troops, and obtained complete po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the country, publi&s;hed a &s;econd, in which they <Q>for|mally invited</Q> the Dutch government to furni&s;h the army, within one month, with the following &s;upplies, viz. 200,000 quintals of wheat; 500,000 of rations of hay; 200,000 rations of &s;traw; 500,000 bu&s;hels of corn; 150,000 pair of &s;hoes; 20,000 pair of boots; 20,000 coats and wai&s;tcoats; 40,000 pair of breeches; 150,000 pair of pantaloons: 200,000 &s;hirts; and 50,000 hats; and be&s;ides all this, 12,000 oxen to be delivered in two months. This requi&s;ition they call <Q>their <HI>ami|cable</HI> intentions,</Q> which they flatter them&s;elves the citizens and the government will &s;hew equal <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eal to &s;econd, and in the execution whereof, they hope that <Q>the &s;low forms of ordinary admini&s;tration, and all doubts about the want of authority, which might im|pede the operation, will be carefully &s;et a&s;ide?</Q> and
<PB N="45" REF="032226_0046_0FF19A5849868D88">they give the Dutch to under&s;tand, that in ca&s;e the ar|ticles were not furni&s;hed, they &s;hould be exacted by force.</P>
<P>It was now too late to he&s;itate; the French had cro&s;&s;|ed the rivers, their army was in the country, and the Dutch had opened their gates to the&s;e <Q>re&s;torers of their liberty;</Q> they were therefore obliged in&s;tantly to comply, and on the &s;ame day, they addre&s;&s;ed a pro|clamation to the people, informing them of the demand, and directing them to furni&s;h their re&s;pective propor|tions. In this proclamation, they remind the peo|ple of the <Q>ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of furni&s;hing the &s;upplies, without the &s;malle&s;t delay, and of the di&s;tre&s;s to which they mu&s;t expo&s;e them&s;elves, if they manife&s;t the lea&s;t unwillingne&s;s, or even procra&s;tination.</Q></P>
<P>This however was only the commencement; they &s;ub&s;i&s;ted their armies in Holland during the winter, took every thing they wanted, and paid in depreciated a&s;&s;ignats at par; and finally they forced the Dutch to form an o&s;&s;en&s;ive and defen&s;ive alliance with them again&s;t England for ever. The treaty was &s;igned on the 15th May, 1795. It obliges the Dutch to cede to France, "as indemnities" two of their mo&s;t important frontier towns, with the adjoining territories, and one of their provinces; to admit French garri&s;ons, in ca&s;e of war in that quarter, into three others of their &s;tronge&s;t fron|tier towns; to admit a French garri&s;on both in peace and war, into one of their principal &s;eaports? to give France the free navigation of one of their principal ri|vers; to employ half their forces in carrying on the pre&s;ent campaign, under the command of French ge|nerals; and finally, to pay France, as a further indem|nification for the expences of the war, one hundred millions of livres, equal to twenty five millions of dol|lars, in ca&s;h or bills of exchange on foreign countries.</P>
<P>In addition to this, it has lately appeared from the &s;tatements made to the Dutch government by a com|mittee of Finance, that for fourteen months then la&s;t, the Dutch had paid two millions of dollars per month, amounting in the whole to twenty eight millions, for the &s;upport of the French armies. The the&s;e two &s;ums add the value of the fir&s;t contribution which was ex|acted
<PB N="46" REF="032226_0047_0FF19A5CD33C8F80">in kind, and they amount at the lea&s;t, to fifty-five millions of dollars, two thirds of the whole expences of our revolution; of this enormous &s;um have the Dutch been plundered by France, under the name of amity and alliance in le&s;s than two years, and in ad|dition to the immen&s;e amount of a&s;&s;ignats they have been forced to receive, to the &s;urrender of a whole province, of their five &s;tronge&s;t frontier towns, and of a principal &s;ea-port, and to the employment of one half of their troops in the &s;ervice of France.</P>
<P>In return for all this, the French have driven away the Statholder and changed the government. They have not &s;uffered the Dutch however to adopt one to their own mind. A convention was called for that purpo&s;e, a great majority of which was in favour of a federal republic. The minority having oppo&s;ed this plan in vain, &s;ent two of their members to Paris to obtain the interference of the French government. The French government did interfere, and the ma|jority was forced to yield. The plan of govern|ment, which this great majority had favoured, was now rejected, and a different form, more &s;uitable to the views of France was impo&s;ed on the nation.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">The names of the deputies who went to France are Van Vicreede and Hooffe. They afterwards publi&s;hed a letter, in which they avow the af|fair and boa&s;t of it. See Gazette of the U. S. April 25, 1797.</NOTE></P>
<P>The Dutch have al&s;o obtained in addition to all the&s;e proofs of amity, an offen&s;ive and defen&s;ive war with France again&s;t England, in which they have already lo&s;t all their rich po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in the Ea&s;t Indies, the Cape of Good Hope, a great part of their fleet, and the re|mains of their trade.</P>
<P>The <HI>ea&s;y conditions</HI> granted to the Dutch were com|plained of in the French convention, and it was alledg|ed, that the commi&s;&s;ioners had not drawn from Hol|land all the advantages which the republic had a right to expect. The commi&s;&s;ioners ju&s;tified them&s;elves by alledging that it would have been <HI>impolitic</HI> to demand
<PB N="47" REF="032226_0048_0FF19A611B3944D0">harder conditions <HI>at fir&s;t,</HI> becau&s;e in that ca&s;e, the Dutch might have been driven to <HI>re&s;i&s;tance.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the report made to the national convention by Cannot, Feb. 18, 1795, in which this whole affair is &s;tated, and the means of re&s;i&s;tance that Holland might have u&s;ed, had &s;he been a&s;&s;ailed under any other ap|pearances than tho&s;e of "fraternity," are ably pointed out.</NOTE></P>
<P>Thus we &s;ee openly avowed and approved, the &s;y&s;tem of coaxing a nation into their power, under the pre|tence of rendering it &s;ervices, and then plundering and oppre&s;&s;ing it without bounds or remor&s;e, under pre|tence of receiving a reward for tho&s;e &s;ervices: and this by a government which has talked to us of our <HI>perfidi|ous neutrality!</HI></P>
<P>Without entering into &s;o minute a detail re&s;pecting belgium, it will be &s;ufficient to &s;tate, that the French en|tered this unfortunate country under repeated and &s;o|lemn promi&s;es of protection and freedom; no &s;ooner had they obtained po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion by the &s;ucce&s;s of their arms and the favour of the inhabitants, who were fooli&s;h enough to confide in their promi&s;es, than they put every article of property which could be of u&s;e to their armies into requi&s;ition, and compelled the people to receive payment in depreciated a&s;&s;ignats at par. They next levied immen&s;e pecuniary contributions on all the towns, they ordered mea&s;ures to be taken for compel|ling the people to exchange their money for a&s;&s;ignats at par.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See the decree of December 15, 1792, and the in&s;tructions to the commi&s;&s;ioners, dated January 8, 1793.</NOTE> They placed the country under the government of military commi&s;&s;ioners: finding that a majority of the conventions, which they had a&s;&s;embled under the pretence of making the people free, were adver&s;e to their views, they di&s;&s;olved the&s;e conventions by force, though freely cho&s;en by the people, and this for the expre&s;s purpo&s;e, to u&s;e the words of one of their commi&s;&s;ioners<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Publicola Chau&s;aid.</NOTE> in the account of his proceedings, <Q>of rai&s;ing up the <HI>minority,</HI> and de&s;troying or counterbal|lancing the power of an <HI>ante patriotic majority.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Having thus afforded "liberty and protection" to the Belgians, having thus <Q>broken their chains, and relea&s;ed them from the yoke of their ancient tyrants,</Q> they proceeded to &s;eize and confi&s;cate, for their own
<PB N="48" REF="032226_0049_0FF19A62AB8C3950">u&s;e, the whole property of the clergy in Belgium, to the amount of more than two hundred and fifty milli|ons of dollars.</P>
<P>The military government and contributions levied at the point of the bayonet, &s;till go on in this <HI>liberated</HI> country, for the gazettes have lately informed us of parties of hor&s;e being &s;ent to &s;eize the provi&s;ions of &s;uch farmers as neglected to bring them in at the orders of the commi&s;&s;ioners.</P>
<P>It may al&s;o be u&s;eful to con&s;ider the example of Italy, to the people of which, the French when they invaded it, al&s;o promi&s;ed liberty; they even carried on for &s;ome time the farce of a convention, at which gen. Buona|parte &s;ent one of his officers with a detachment of troops to pre&s;ide. Having by the&s;e means inticed the&s;e &s;imple people to a&s;&s;i&s;t them again&s;t their own govern|ment, they have lately in their treaty with the Pope &s;tipulated, that the&s;e provinces which belong<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> to him, &s;hall not be made free, but <HI>be ceded to France.</HI> In the mean time they plundered the churches and the cities, &s;tript the country to which they had promi&s;ed freedom, of its wealth by enormous contributions, and com|pelled the militia to join their armies. Be&s;ides the territory which they compelled the Pope to relinqui&s;h, they exacted from him upwards of &s;ix millions of dol|lars, and many of his mo&s;t valuable effects, and forced him to receive a French garri&s;on into one of his &s;ea|port towns.</P>
<P>Thus it is that France deals with countries which &s;he can intice or compel into her gra&s;p. Let us &s;ee how &s;he acts towards &s;uch as are willing and able to re&s;i&s;t.</P>
<P>The Swi&s;s being neighbours to France, and having re&s;olved according to their u&s;ual policy, to remain neuter in the pre&s;ent war, &s;he early began as &s;he has done in our ca&s;e, to claim the right of directing their affairs under the pretence of enforcing the ob&s;ervance of <HI>treaties</HI> and of the laws of <HI>neutrality.</HI> The Swi&s;s, as we have done, for a long time bore with her through a love of peace, but &s;till, though in the milde&s;t terms, repelled her preten&s;ions.

<P>Her claims on our ju&s;tice, re&s;t upon the &s;tipula|tions of treaties, and the duties of neutrality. The&s;e have already been examined, and it has appeared how far they are from &s;upporting her preten&s;ions.</P>
<P>But our gratitude, we are told, forms a &s;tronger tie, and re&s;ts on foundations &s;till more &s;acred. She proud|ly holds up to our view her a&s;&s;i&s;tance in our &s;truggle for independence; her commercial benefits, conferred in the pre&s;ent war; and the religious punctuality where|with, as &s;he a&s;&s;erts her &s;tipulations in the treaty with us have been fulfilled. On the&s;e is &s;ounded, accord|ing to her, a debt of gratitude, which-nothing le&s;s than our independance can pay.</P>
<P>Again and again has &s;he reminded us that to her we are indebted for the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of our freedom: again and again has &s;he recalled her &s;ervices to our recollection, and upbraided us with our ingratitude: again and again, has &s;he repeated her claim to unbounded compliance with her wi&s;hes, as the return for her a&s;&s;i&s;tance.

To crown the whole, the directory in a public &s;peech to our late our late mini&s;ter at Paris, expre&s;&s;ed their hope, <Q>that the Americans, proud of their liberty, would never forget that they <HI>owe it to France.</HI></Q></P>
<P>In the affairs of private life it is a rule, that to be upbraided with benefits received, very much impairs the obligation they create; and that to demand a reward for what was conferred as a favour, changes the obli|gations of gratitude into a debt by contract.

<P>As to &s;tipulations, there are none which can warrant the demands of France; for in that very treaty whereby the a&s;&s;i&s;tance &s;o boa&s;ted of was furni&s;hed, it is expre&s;ly declared, <Q>that each party being re&s;olved to fulfil on its own part, the clau&s;es and conditions of the pre&s;ent treaty of alliance, according to its own power and cir|cum&s;tances, there &s;hall be no after claim of com|pen&s;ation on the one &s;ide or the other.</Q> The only benefit &s;tipulated for France, was our guarantee of her i&s;lands; but this &s;tipulation, which was to take effect only when France &s;hould be engaged in a <HI>defen&s;ive</HI> war, does not operate in this ca&s;e; becau&s;e in the pre&s;ent war &s;he is clearly the aggre&s;&s;or: and of this &s;he is &s;o &s;en&s;ible, that amid&s;t all her extravagant demands, &s;he has never called on us for the fulfillment of the gua|rantee.</P>
<P>A reward claimed for &s;ervices on the principles of ju&s;tice, mu&s;t be regulated by two con&s;iderations; what the &s;ervices were fairly worth, and what the parties at the time, may be &s;uppo&s;ed to have tacitly contemplated as the price. But can any po&s;&s;ible &s;ervice be worth our independence, nothing le&s;s than which France de|mands? Ought we in ju&s;tice to make her this return, even if, as &s;he pretends, &s;he had be&s;towed this independ|ence? Can it be &s;uppo&s;ed, that when the &s;ervices were rendered, &s;he ever expected, or we would ever have con&s;ented, that this &s;hould be con&s;idered as their price? What in that ca&s;e &s;hould we have gained by our &s;even years &s;truggle, by the de&s;truction of our property, by the deva&s;tation of our country, by the long toils and the blood of our citizens, and by our

Nothing is better known than that the pride of France never received &s;o deep a wound as at the peace of 1763. It was by that peace, that after a war, in which her power, in the four quarters of the globe, had &s;unk un|der the arms of Britain, guided at that time by the genius of the elder Pitt, &s;he found her&s;elf obliged to &s;ub&s;cribe to terms which her &s;tate&s;men, her warriors, and her writers, have never cea&s;ed to reprobate and la|ment. She tried every means to recruit her &s;trength; &s;ought to fortify her&s;elf every where by new alliances; and waited with impatience for the moment, when cir|cum&s;tances might enable her to renew the combat, with better omens of &s;ucce&s;s. This moment &s;he &s;aw ap|proach in the quarrel which broke out in 1775, between Great Britain and her colonies: and &s;he immediately took into con&s;ideration how the opportunity might be&s;t be improved. This was the &s;ubject of her mo&s;t anx|ious care, of the mo&s;t profound deliberations of her wi&s;e&s;t &s;tate&s;men.</P>
<P>The re&s;ult of the&s;e deliberations may be &s;een in a piece drawn up in April 1776, by Mr. Turgot, at that time one of the mini&s;ters of Lewis the &s;ixteenth, and intitled, <Q>Reflections upon the manner in which France and Spain ought to regard the con&s;equences of the quarrel between Great Britain and her colo|nies;</Q> in this piece, which Mr. Turgot declares to be intirely conformable to the opinions of Mr. De Ver|gennes, it is declared, that the event the <Q>mo&s;t de|&s;irable for the intere&s;ts of the two crowns (France and Spain) would be the reduction of the colonies again under the yoke of England.</Q> The rea&s;on a&s;|&s;igned for this opinion is extremely &s;triking, and un|veils mo&s;t completely the &s;y&s;tem of the French policy. <Q>If the colonies &s;hould not he reduced till after the ruin of all their re&s;ources, England would lo&s;e the advantages which &s;he has hitherto drawn from them, not only for the augmentation of her commerce in time of peace, but in the u&s;e of their forces in time of war. If on the contrary, the colonies &s;hould be &s;ubdued without the de&s;truction of their wealth and their population, they would pre&s;erve al&s;o their cou|rage and their de&s;ire of independence, and England
<PB N="56" REF="032226_0057_0FF19A7D80D81C38">would be compelled to employ part of her forces in preventing a new revolt.</Q></P>
<P>Thus we &s;ee that the&s;e generous beenefactors de|&s;ired no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ing &s;o much as the de&s;truction of all our re&s;ources, and even of our population, by a tedious and bloody, conte&s;t; and then our final reduction under the yoke of our former ma&s;ters.</P>
<P>To effect this plan; to enable us to make this long re&s;i&s;tance, by which our wealth and population were to be de&s;troyed; Mr. Turgot advi&s;es, <Q>that France &s;hould furni&s;h us, by means of the merchants, with the warlike &s;tores, and even with the money, which we might be in need of; but without abandoning her own neutrality, or affording any direct a&s;&s;i&s;|tance.</Q> This he &s;aid was by all means to be avoided; becau&s;e it would involve France in the war; who, without remaining in peace her&s;elf, could not reap all the expected advantages from the weak and ruined &s;tate, whereto England and the colonies would be re|duced by the &s;truggle.</P>
<P>Another rea&s;on, and in his opinion a deci&s;ive one, for avoiding war, or even the appearance of it, he de|clares to be <Q>the tendency which the one or the other would have to bring about a reconciliation between the colonies and the mother country, and thus ex|po&s;e France to the danger which &s;he mo&s;t dreaded,</Q> that is, the danger of their &s;peedy reunion, with undi|mini&s;hed forces.</P>
<P>And finally, the better to accompli&s;h this plan, he recommends the adoption of mea&s;ures <Q>for obtaining exact information of all that pa&s;&s;ed in the colonies; without however giving room to &s;u&s;pect, that France had there any direct or authori&s;ed agent.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This piece of Mr. Turgot was found with many other &s;ecret &s;tate-pa|pers, in the Cabinet of Louis the Sixteenth, and after his death was pub|li&s;hed by the Convention.</NOTE></Q> </P>
<P>The tendency of this plan to weaken and reduce the power of England is ea&s;ily &s;een; but I cannot find in it the lea&s;t trace of good faith, or good will, towards the colonies; much le&s;s of a wi&s;h to promote their pro&s;peri|ty,
<PB N="57" REF="032226_0058_0FF19A7F392FADD0">or e&s;tabli&s;h their independence. The very contrary indeed is expre&s;sly declared.</P>
<P>That this plan, contrived by Turgot and Vergennes, was afterwards adopted by the French government, is perfectly well known; not only from the power which tho&s;e two mini&s;ters then, and for a long time after, en|joyed in France, but from the conduct of the govern|ment and its expre&s;s declarations. In March 1784, we find M. de Vergennes, in a memoir addre&s;&s;ed to Louis the sixteenth, on the conduct ob&s;erved by the French government towards other powers, reminding him, <Q><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> his maje&s;ty, provoked by the violence and inju&s;|tice of England, had employed him&s;elf &s;eriou&s;ly about the means,</Q> of doing, what? of e&s;tabli&s;hing the independence of the colonies? No:<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This memoire of M. de Vergennes, was another of the pieces found among the private papers of Louis the Sixteenth.</NOTE> but <Q>of re|pre&s;&s;ing the pride and ambition of that enterpri&s;ing nation, and of preventing the revolution which had broken out in North America, from turning to the prejudice of France; for <HI>which view</HI> a negociation had already been commenced with the United States, when the unexpected death of the Elector of Bava|ria called his attention to the affairs of Germany.</Q></P>
<P>Thus when the king and his mini&s;ter come to talk over the matter in private, where men tell the truth without di&s;gui&s;e, they explain the true motives of their conduct. We find that they were actuated, not by good will to the Americans, but by re&s;entment again&s;t England; not by a wi&s;h to promote the advantage of America, but to repre&s;s the pride and ambition of Eng|land; and that it was for this view, and not to &s;ecure our independence, that the negociation was commenc|ed.</P>
<P>It is indeed perfectly well known that untill they heard of the capture of Burgoyne, and the conciliato|ry offers of England, the French government treated all our advances with the greate&s;t indifference; and to u&s;e their own words in their an&s;wer to the Engli&s;h mani|fe&s;to, <Q>had all times manife&s;ted a di&s;like to any en|gagement
<PB N="58" REF="032226_0059_0FF19A8107C5E610">with the colonies,</Q> this was entirely con|formable to her policy of avoiding the war, while Bri|tain and the colonies &s;hould go on to exhau&s;t each other by a long &s;truggle, and afford her an opportunity of attacking them both afterwards with entire forces. But when Burgoyne was taken, and the Engli&s;h offered us all we a&s;ked, except independence, then France, for fear we &s;hould accede, and le&s;t that reunion which &s;he &s;o much dreaded, &s;hould take place, immediately departed from her former policy, and concluded a treaty with us, on terms far more favourable than tho&s;e, which we had be|fore &s;olicited in vain.</P>
<P>Her rea&s;ons for doing &s;o, are very fully and &s;trongly expre&s;&s;ed, in the following extract from her an&s;wer to the Briti&s;h manife&s;to.</P>
<P><Q>It is &s;ufficient for the ju&s;tification of his maje&s;ty, that the colonies, which form a nation con&s;iderable for the number of their inhabitants as well as for the extent of their dominion, have <HI>e&s;tabli&s;hed their inde|pendence,</HI> not only by a &s;olemn declaration, <HI>but al&s;o in fact,</HI> and have &s;upported it again&s;t the efforts of their mother country; &s;uch was in effect the &s;itua|tion of the United States, <HI>when his maje&s;ty began to negociate with them.</HI> His maje&s;ty had full liberty of con&s;idering them as independent, or as &s;ubjects of Great Britain; and he cho&s;e the fir&s;t part, becau&s;e <HI>his &s;afety,</HI> the <HI>intere&s;t</HI> of his people, <HI>invariable policy,</HI> and above all, the &s;ecret projects of the court of London, imperiou&s;ly laid him under the nece&s;&s;ity.</Q></P>
<P>The an&s;wer then a&s;&s;erts, that the alliance, formed under the pre&s;&s;ure of this <HI>imperious nece&s;&s;ity,</HI> was, <Q>even|tual and purely defen&s;ive; not to take effect unle&s;s France &s;hould be attacked by the court of London before the ce&s;&s;ation of ho&s;tilities with the colonies.</Q></P>
<P>Thus we find that this boa&s;ted alliance, to which we have have been &s;o often and &s;o in&s;ultingly told that we owe our independence, was not re&s;olved on by France, till after &s;he knew that our independence was <HI>in fact</HI> e&s;tabli&s;hed; was dictated by imperious nece&s;&s;ity, and a regard to the <HI>&s;afety</HI> and <HI>intere&s;ts</HI> of France; and was
<PB N="59" REF="032226_0060_0FF19A86A22DD120">not to take effect unle&s;s &s;he would be attacked by our enemies!</P>
<P>And le&s;t the evidence of circum&s;tances and the point|ed declarations of the former government of France on this &s;ubject, &s;hould be doubted, the republic has al&s;o added its re&s;timony. The executive council, in its in|&s;tructions to Mr Genet, declares <Q>that the min&s;ters of Louis the &s;ixteenth thought it right for France to hinder the United States from taking that political &s;tability of which they were capable; becau&s;e they would &s;oon acquire a &s;trength which it was probable they would be eager to abu&s;e. The &s;ame machive|lian policy,</Q> continue the in&s;tructions, <Q>influenced the operations of the war for independence; the &s;ame duplicity reigned over the negocitions for peace,</Q> and in fact we know that the French go|vernment thwarted the&s;e negociations to the utmo&s;t of its power, and &s;trove to render the conditions of the peace, which it had in vain &s;triven to prevent, as di&s;|advantageous to us as po&s;&s;ible, by depriving us of the Fi&s;heries, the we&s;tern country, and the navigation of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi. This was conformable to their &s;y&s;tem of keeping us at war as long as po&s;&s;ible, and leaving us at the end of it, as weak as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>Surely therefore it may be expected, that we &s;hall at length cea&s;e to be told of the di&s;intere&s;ted genero&s;ity of France in e&s;tabli&s;hing our independence, and of our ingratitude to her on that account.</P>
<P>Does her claim to our gratitude for commercial fa|vours during the pre&s;ent war, re&s;t on a better founda|tion? She has indeed opened her We&s;t India ports to us; and of this we have been again and again reminded. But at what time was it done? At the time when &s;he had re&s;olved to give up her commerce, and convert all her &s;hips into privateers for the purpo&s;e of de&s;troying that of England.</P>
<P>As the productions of her colonies were of indi&s;|pen&s;ible u&s;e to her, it was infinitely her intere&s;t that we &s;hould become the carriers of them, more e&s;pecially as we were the only neutral power, who&s;e local &s;ituation, and number of &s;hips, could enable it to effect the object.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="032226_0061_0FF19A8831C7CE10">
She hoped al&s;o to obtain another very de&s;ireable ob|ject. It was well known to her that England claimed a right to take the goods of her enemies on board of neutral ve&s;&s;els. When we &s;hould engage in this car|rying trade between France and her colonies, we &s;hould of cour&s;e become expo&s;ed to infinite vexation from the exerci&s;e of this right. The profits of the trade would tempt us on one hand, while the vexations would pro|voke us on the other; and by this double operation the great object of bringing us into the war would be very much promoted. France al&s;o would be furni&s;hed with that pretext which we find her now u&s;ing, for in&s;i&s;ting on us to employ what &s;he calls <HI>efficacious means</HI> in cau&s;ing her property on board of our &s;hips to be re&s;pected by England. If we &s;hould &s;ucceed, the property would go free, and that would be a great benefit; if we &s;hould fail, we &s;hould neverthele&s;s be involved in the war, and that would be a greater &s;till.</P>
<P>The &s;weets of this commerce too, it was hoped, would intice us into an alliance offen&s;ive and defen&s;ive for the purpo&s;e of &s;ecuring it; and accordingly we find that when Mr. Genet was in&s;tructed to draw us into &s;uch an alliance, this was the bait which he was ordered to employ.</P>
<P>Thus it is manife&s;t, that what we are now upbraided with as a generous and u&s;eful indulgence, was in fact a mo&s;t dangerous &s;nare, from which great good for|tune and the prudence of our government, joined to its un&s;haken firmne&s;s, could alone have enabled us to e&s;cape.</P>
<P>She re&s;ts her claim to our gratitude in the la&s;t place, on the re&s;pect which &s;he has paid to our intere&s;ts and our wi&s;hes, and the punctuality wherewith &s;he has ful|filled her duties towards us.</P>
<P>One in&s;tance of her attention to our wi&s;hes is, the re|cal of Mr. Genet, in which &s;he now a&s;&s;erts, that <Q>li&s;tening only to the complaints of the American go|vernment, &s;he immediately gave the mo&s;t ample &s;a|tisfaction. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Mr. Adet's note</NOTE></Q></P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="032226_0062_0FF19A89F34E23D8">
We, however, perfectly well know, that this recall proceeded not from complai&s;ance to us, but from the fall of the Bri&s;&s;otine party, to which Mr. Genet be|longed, and by which he was &s;ent here. Robe&s;piere, who then came into power, not only drove all the men of that party from their employments, but de&s;troy|ed as many of them as he could catch; but that France never abandoned the &s;y&s;tem which Genet had pur&s;ued, is mo&s;t evident from the pre&s;ent mea&s;ures, in which we &s;ee that &s;y&s;tem avowed and enforced. It is al&s;o evident from the whole corre&s;pondence of his two &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ors, which though not always quite as offen&s;ive in expre&s;&s;ion as that of Genet, was no le&s;s exceptionable in principle and &s;ub&s;tance. Indeed that appeal to the people, the mere threat of which was con&s;idered as the mo&s;t offen&s;ive and outrageous of all Genet's proceed|ings, has actually been made by one of his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, in the mo&s;t formal manner and by expre&s;s orders of the French government.</P>
<P>Another in&s;tance is, that France, on the application of our mini&s;ter, repealed, as far as re&s;pected us, one of her decrees, which was injurious to the commerce of neutral &s;tates. This repeal, it is true, did take place; but unfortunately, the repealing law it&s;elf was repealed three days afterwards, through the influence of &s;ome French privateers, which had taken a very rich American &s;hip; and the fir&s;t decree was left for many months to operate in a manner the mo&s;t injurious to our commerce.</P>
<P>This leads to the que&s;tion, how far France has intitled her&s;elf to particular favour from us by her punctual ob|&s;ervance of treaties? For this al&s;o is one of the merits; whereof in the mid&s;t of her reproaches, &s;he has repeat|edly reminded us. Her mini&s;ters have repeatedly told us of <Q>the religious punctuality with which the French Republic keeps her engagements with a nation to whom &s;he has not cea&s;ed to te&s;tify her attachment.</Q> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">See Mr. Fauchet's letter of May 23,1795, and Mr. Genet's cor|re&s;pondence throughout.</NOTE> Let us &s;ee how punctual this ob&s;ervance has been, and what are the proofs of this attachment.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="032226_0063_0FF19A8D32EB2800">
On the 9th of May, 1793, before the Briti&s;h com|menced their &s;poliations on our commerce, the national convention of France pa&s;&s;ed a decree, authorizing her <Q>&s;hips of war and privateers, to capture all neutral ve&s;&s;els loaded, in whole or in part, with merchan|dizes belonging to enemies, or with provi&s;ions belong|ing to neutrals, but bound to enemies ports.</Q></P>
<P>This was prior by one month, to the fir&s;t orders of the Briti&s;h government, under which our provi&s;ions, de&s;tined for French ports, were made prize. Thus did France &s;et the example of tho&s;e very mea&s;ures, again&s;t which, even while &s;he contiued to pur&s;ue them her&s;elf, &s;he &s;o violently exclaimed as &s;oon as they were imitated by the Briti&s;h, and to compel the recal where|of &s;he has &s;o often told us that our honour, and our good faith to her, required us to make war again&s;t England!</P>
<P>This decree of May 9, 1793, being a plain and di|rect violation of our treaty with France,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Which declares, that free &s;hips between us and her &s;hall make free goods.</NOTE> our mini&s;ter at Paris complained, and on the 23d of the &s;ame month a new decree was pa&s;&s;ed, declaring that the former &s;hould not extend to American ve&s;&s;els; and thus plainly confe&s;&s;ing its inju&s;tice. The &s;econd decree however was repealed only two days after it pa&s;&s;ed, and the fir&s;t remained in force again&s;t our commerce. Our mini|&s;ter again complained, and on the fir&s;t of July the convention again decreed, that the decree of May the ninth &s;hould not extend to American ve&s;&s;els. This was a &s;econd acknowledgement of its inju&s;tice; and yet twenty-&s;even days afterwards, it was again enforced again&s;t our commerce by the repeal of the la&s;t decree for re&s;tricting it: and then it remained in force until January the 4th, 1795.</P>
<P>During this period a very con&s;iderable number of our ve&s;&s;els were carried into French ports by her pri|vateers and &s;hips of war. It al&s;o became a practice to &s;eize cargoes &s;ent in to her ports by our merchants, and employ them for public u&s;e, without paying for them. Her agents al&s;o purcha&s;ed con&s;iderable quan|tities of provi&s;ions from our citizens, and drew bills
<PB N="63" REF="032226_0064_0FF19A92D4398938">for payment on the government of France, or on her mini&s;ter in this country, which in many in&s;tances were not paid. Tho&s;e agents frequently made contracts al&s;o with our citizen for &s;upplies of provi&s;ions, which, when the provi&s;ions arrived, they refu&s;ed to fulfill. The pri|vateers and &s;hips of war of France, frequently com|mitted &s;poliations at &s;ea on &s;uch of our ve&s;&s;els as did not come within the decree of May 9, 1793, and final|ly an embargo was laid on our ve&s;&s;els in Bourdeaux, and continued during the greater part of the years 1793 and 1794, whereby one hundred and three of our ve&s;&s;els were detained, and our merchants &s;u&s;tained very great injury.</P>
<P>There were many ca&s;es of all the&s;e de&s;criptions, and each of them was a plain infraction of the treaty, the law of nations, or the rights of neutrality. Many of them included a breach of all three; and the whole number amounted to one hundred and &s;eventy, exclu|&s;ive of tho&s;e for detention by the embargo at Bor|deaux.</P>
<P>Our government, however, did not imitate that of France, by directing our mini&s;ters to importune and in&s;ult it, to rai&s;e an outcry in the country, or threaten the government with an appeal to the people. It &s;ent an agent to Paris with in&s;tructions to attend to tho&s;e claims, and endeavour to obtain indemnification.</P>
<P>Let us hear this agents account of the manner in which the French government re&s;pected the rights of its allies, and fulfilled the &s;tipulations of treaties.</P>
<P>The agent, Mr. Skipwith, in a letter addre&s;&s;ed to the American mini&s;ter at Paris, and dated October 1794, writes thus.</P>
<Q><P>At your reque&s;t I now lay before you a &s;tatement of the innumerable embarra&s;ments which our com|merce has for a long time, and continues &s;till to la|bour under, in the different ports of the French Re|public. It is evident, if their government does not &s;oon remedy the ince&s;&s;ant abu&s;es and vexations prac|ti&s;ed daily upon our merchants, ve&s;&s;els, captains, and crews, the trade of the United States with France mu&s;t cea&s;e. I cannot give you an ample
<PB N="64" REF="032226_0065_0FF19A95D4083450">detail of all the inconveniencies and oppre&s;&s;ions which have been thrown upon our commerce; many of the con&s;uls and their agents to whom you have written to forward &s;uch documents to my office not having yet done it; be&s;ides, it would take volumes to expo&s;e them at full length.</P>
<P>From the communications, however, already re|ceived from the different ports, and from the infor|mation I have collected from the captains pre&s;ent, I can a&s;&s;ure you that there are near <HI>three hundred &s;ail</HI> of American ve&s;&s;els now in the ports of France, all of which have &s;uffered, or are &s;uffering more or le&s;s difficulty and delay.&mdash;The hard&s;hips of which I have chiefly to complain, and out of which there grows in|calculable evils, may be developed under four ge|neral heads.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1&s;t. The capture <HI>indi&s;criminately,</HI> of our ve&s;&s;els at &s;ea, by the ve&s;&s;els of war of the republic.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2d. The impo&s;&s;ibility of Americans &s;elling their cargoes, and receiving payment in the ports to which they are conducted, or of their own accord arrive.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3d. The difficulties and procra&s;tination which they find in their tran&s;actions with the boards of marine and commerce.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4th. The non-compliance, or heretofore delay, in fulfilling the contracts made by the agents of the French Republic in America for provi&s;ions.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>The &s;eizure of our ve&s;&s;els at &s;ea, often gives ri&s;e to the mo&s;t &s;erious and well founded complaints.&mdash; The &s;tripping them of their officers and crews, who are generally replaced by boys and inexperienced hands, in order to be conducted to ports, expo&s;es them to much injury, and &s;ometimes to total lo&s;s; the confinement of our &s;ailors taken out of tho&s;e ve&s;&s;els, the &s;eals upon their cargoes, and above all, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he &s;ending the papers to the commi&s;&s;ioners of ma|rine at Paris, involves the mo&s;t unwarrantable hard|&s;hips and delays; and indeed I am &s;orry to add, that <HI>all</HI> our ve&s;&s;els experience &s;ome of tho&s;e difficulties, and indeed &s;uch as arrive with cargoes on account of the Republic, months clap&s;ing before the captains
<PB N="65" REF="032226_0066_0FF19A9785B58858">can get their clearances and papers, many of which are often lo&s;t or mi&s;laid.</P>
<P> As to the &s;econd head, the agents of the commi&s;|&s;ion of commerce at the different ports, having no power to treat directly for cargoes, it follows that they mu&s;t write to the commi&s;&s;ion at Paris for orders, and after one or two months fruitle&s;s corre&s;pondence, it often happens that the captains are obliged to come up to Paris, where being ignorant of forms and language, they have to encounter a thou&s;and dif|ficulties.</P>
<P>It would be too tedious to mention all the incon|veniencies re&s;ulting from the third general complaint. In the fir&s;t place, the delays at the commi&s;&s;ion of marine are incredible. The captains, who&s;e ve&s;&s;els are brought into ports by the armed ve&s;&s;els of the Republic, cannot withdraw their papers from the hands of the marine agents, but are forced to Paris to &s;olicit, time after time, of the marine, a report upon them to the committee of Public Safety. The cruel delays attending this will be illu&s;trated in the examples annext. The report being made before it can reach the latter body, it mu&s;t have the &s;ignature of the commi&s;&s;aries, and go through other formali|ties, and when it receives the &s;anction of the com|mittee of &s;afety, it has to travel nearly the &s;ame road back. Judge, &s;ir, of the tedious delay attend|ing this; indeed you will &s;ee ca&s;es where the poor captains have been many months in arriving at the above point, and I my&s;elf, after having pre&s;&s;ed &s;everal reclamations for weeks pa&s;t, have not been able yet to bring one to that i&s;&s;ue.</P>
<P>To &s;ell to the commi&s;&s;ion of commerce is &s;till more difficult. When a bargain is concluded with them, an order is i&s;&s;ued to the keepers of the public magazines, to receive the cargo &s;old; who often pretend that there is no room to receive it, and frequetly they keep the captains waiting weeks before their conve|nience or whim will induce them to receive it. This point gained, application mu&s;t then be made at Pa|ris to the commi&s;&s;ion of commerce for payment;
<PB N="66" REF="032226_0067_0FF19A9941A84160">who refer the captain to their board of agency. They make a report to the comptability (the accountants department) of the &s;ame commi&s;&s;ion, from whence it mu&s;t go to the committee of Finance, then to the committee of public &s;afety, from whence it returns to the comptability. This labyrinth of perplexity of cour&s;e throws the captain into the hands of an agent, who preys upon his di&s;tre&s;s; and when all the&s;e forms are fulfilled, it is not always that he can touch his money.</P>
<P>If in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, the commi&s;&s;ion will not purcha&s;e his cargo on the terms he a&s;ks, they tell him he may depart; but on returning to his ve&s;&s;el, he is mo&s;t commonly prevented from &s;ailing by the agents at the ports. If it is mutually agreed that merchandi&s;e &s;hall be taken in exchange, the difficul|ties become greater. If a&s;&s;ignats with permi&s;&s;ion to export wines and brandy, the captain finds him&s;elf taken in; for the agents will put tho&s;e very articles in requi&s;iton. If the commi&s;&s;ion tells the captain that they do not want his cargo, and that he may &s;ell to individuals, he finds that he cannot export the proceeds without giving &s;ecurity to import afterwards to the &s;ame amount in articles of the fir&s;t nece&s;&s;ity, &s;uch as provi&s;ions &amp;c. If the captain is &s;o unfortunate as to have to treat with the agents of the commi&s;&s;ion, he is &s;ure to feel their impo&s;ition. They frequently refu&s;e to confirm their own agreements. In &s;hort after every &s;ort of delay and vexation, &s;hould the captain claim an indemnity, he has to wade thro' double the difficulties heretofore &s;tated, and perhaps after all to leave his bu&s;ine&s;s incomplete in the hands of an agent.</P>
<P>The 4th and la&s;t general complaint is of a delicate and important import. Mr. Fauchet the French mi|ni&s;ter, has made con&s;iderable purcha&s;es of provi&s;ions in America in the name and for account of the French republic. One Hou&s;e has engaged to furni&s;h 20,000 barrels of flour. Thirteen ve&s;&s;els loaded with the&s;e provi&s;ions have already arrived, and in vain have I demanded of the commi&s;&s;ion of commerce their an|&s;wer
<PB N="67" REF="032226_0068_0FF19AA0703DD698">re&s;pecting the payment of the&s;e contracts; except that in the commencement they a&s;&s;ured me, the com|mittee of Finance had ordered the payment of three cargoes at Bordeaux; but to my &s;urpri&s;e I found two days after, that no report had been made to the commi&s;&s;ion of that committee.</P></Q>
<P>Thus far the agent. He then proceeds to &s;tate 24 particular in&s;tances of oppre&s;&s;ion, by way of illu&s;trati|on, and gives a li&s;t of one hundred and &s;eventy ca&s;es which he had then brought forward. To this he adds a li&s;t of one hundred and three ve&s;&s;els detained by the embargo at Bordeaux.</P>
<P>Let it be remembered that all this took place in the years 1793 and 1794; previous to the exi&s;tance of the Bri|ti&s;h treaty, which France has &s;ince made the pretext of her outrages, and at the very time when &s;he was boa&s;t|ing to us of the "religious punctuality" with which &s;he fulfilled the engagements of her treaty, and the duties of a neutral and allied power. While &s;he was quarrel|ling with us for the detention of a few privateers and their prizes, who&s;e whole number at the utmo&s;t did not exceed twenty: &s;he had three hundred of our ve&s;&s;els in her ports, &s;ubject to <Q>ince&s;&s;ant vexations, abu&s;es, and oppre&s;&s;ions</Q> and a great part of which had been car|ried in by her crui&s;ers, contrary to the law of nations, and in expre&s;s violation of our treaty. While her mi|ni&s;ters were in&s;ulting our government, becau&s;e it did not take what they cho&s;e to call <HI>efficatious</HI> mea&s;ures, to prevent the capture of our ve&s;&s;els at &s;ea by the Briti&s;h, and the impre&s;s of our &s;eamen, her &s;hips of war were &s;eizing our ve&s;&s;els at &s;ea indi&s;criminately, &s;tripping them of their officers and crews, confining our &s;ailors, and leaving the &s;hips to the care of boys and inexperienced hands. While &s;he was complaining in the bittere&s;t and mo&s;t offen&s;ive terms, of delays in our courts, the citi|zens of the United States, even &s;uch as had gone to her ports under the faith of expre&s;s contracts with her mini&s;ter, were obliged, in the pro&s;ecution of their claims, "to encounter a thou&s;and difficulties," to &s;ubmit to every arbitrary impo&s;ition, to &s;uffer <Q>every &s;ort of de|lay
<PB N="68" REF="032226_0069_0FF19AA214FCE8D8">and vexation,</Q> and finally to give up the pur&s;ait, and leave their bu&s;ine&s;s in the hands of an agent.</P>
<P>And yet France upbraids us with her favours and our ingratitude! and yet &s;he reproachingly boafts of <Q>the religious punctuality wherewith &s;he fulfils her engagements with a people, to whom &s;he has never cea&s;ed to te&s;tify her attachment!</Q></P>
<P>Such, my fellow citizens, being the claims of France, and &s;uch the foundations on which they re&s;t; &s;uch being the inadmi&s;&s;ible nature and alarming extent of her preten&s;ions; it remains for me to pre&s;ent you with a conci&s;e view of the mea&s;ures whereby &s;he is now attempting to enforce them.</P>
<P>The&s;e mea&s;ures commenced with a formal &s;tatement of her complaints pre&s;ented to our mini&s;ter at Paris on the 9th of March, 1796. It was an&s;wered by the mini&s;ter and tran&s;mitted to the government here im|mediately after. The complaints and the an&s;wers to them were the &s;ame in &s;ub&s;tance with tho&s;e already explained.</P>
<P>On the 3d of July, 1796, &s;he pa&s;&s;ed a decree direct|ing her privateers and &s;hips of war to treat the ve&s;&s;els of neutrals in the &s;ame manner in which tho&s;e neutrals &s;hould &s;uffer their ve&s;&s;els to be treated by the Engli&s;h. This decree was notified to our government by the French mini&s;ter at Philadelphia, on the 27th of October, 1796.</P>
<P>This decree goes expre&s;sly upon the principle, equal|ly unju&s;t and ab&s;urd, that if neutral &s;tates receive an injury from one party which they are unable to repel, the other acquires a right to inflict it likewi&s;e. As it re&s;pects the United States it goes much further, and avows another priciple no le&s;s repugnant to every idea of ju&s;tice and good faith. Britain po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es by the law of nations, a right to take the goods of her enemies &s;ound on board of our &s;hips. This right France re|&s;inqui&s;hed expre&s;ly by the treaty with us; but becau&s;e Britain continues to exerci&s;e it, notwith&s;tanding our endeavours to obtain her relinqui&s;hment, France de|clares by this decree, that &s;he will exerci&s;e it al&s;o, in expre&s;s violation of the treaty. The rea&s;on a&s;&s;igned
<PB N="69" REF="032226_0070_0FF19AA3A6A81E40">for it by her mini&s;ter is, <Q>that &s;ince Britain continued to exerci&s;e this right, France could find only a real di&s;advantage in the articles of her treaty with us, whereby &s;he had re&s;igned it:</Q> thus expre&s;ly avow|ing the principle that &s;he has a right to refu&s;e the performance of a &s;olemn engagement whenever &s;he may think its operations di&s;advantageous to her|&s;elf.</P>
<P>The mini&s;ter &s;ays that he has no doubt that we would acknowledge the ju&s;tice of this mea&s;ure, and that he would order his note to be printed for the purpo&s;e of making known publicly the motives whereby the French government has been guided in adopting the mea&s;ure. In this he kept his word, and the note was publi&s;hed.</P>
<P>On the 15th of November, 1796; the French mi|ni&s;ter, performing, to u&s;e his own words, "a duty painful but &s;acred," &s;ignified to us <Q>the re&s;olutions of a government terrible to its enemies, but generous to its allies;</Q> this note, which he al&s;o publi&s;hed, contains the whole li&s;t of complaints urged again&s;t us by France, and announces that his functions as mini&s;ter were from that time to cea&s;e. This &s;u&s;pen&s;ion, however, he tells us, mu&s;t not be regarded as a rupture between the two nations, but as a <Q>mark of ju&s;t di&s;plea&s;ure on the part of France, to continue till our government &s;hould return to &s;entiments and mea&s;ures more conformable to the intere&s;ts of the alliance, and to the &s;worn friend&s;hip between the two nations,</Q> and after re|minding us in very inflamatory terms, of the cruelties of the Engli&s;h, and the <HI>generous a&s;&s;i&s;tance</HI> of France, he concludes with an a&s;&s;urance <Q>that when our govern|ment &s;hall return to <HI>it&s;elf,</HI> we &s;hall again find in the French, faithful friends and generous allies.</Q></P>
<P>Such is the &s;cope of that famous mani&s;e&s;to, wherein Mr. Genet's threat of an appeal to the American people again&s;t their government, was carried into execution.!</P>
<P>Other mea&s;ures in the mean time had been adopted in pur&s;uance of this &s;y&s;tem. On the 1&s;t of Augu&s;t, 1796, the &s;pecial agents of the Executive Directory in the We&s;t-Indies, i&s;&s;ued a decree authorizing the cap|ture
<PB N="70" REF="032226_0071_0FF19AA6ACFC47F8">and condemnation of all ve&s;&s;els loaded with con|traband goods. The pretext for this decree was, that &s;ome of the United States, e&s;pecially Virginia, had fitted out ve&s;&s;els loaded with contraband articles for the Engli&s;h, contrary to the law of nations; which, as the decree affirms, forbids neutrals to carry contraband goods to the enemy.</P>
<P>This however, in the fir&s;t place, is not true. The law of nations does not forbid neutrals to carry contra|band goods to the powers at war; it provides only that if tho&s;e goods taken by the enemy of that power to which they are going, they may be made prize. Neutrals therefore, may lawfully &s;end contraband articles to any or all the powers at war; but they are &s;ent under the ri&s;k of capture and condemnation by the oppo&s;ite party.</P>
<P>This had been admitted by Mr. Adet; for altho' he complained at fir&s;t of our &s;upplying the Engli&s;h with hor&s;es, which by the French treaty are contraband, yet this explanation having been given, he omitted the complaint in his manife&s;to.</P>
<P>In the next place, by the law of nations, and the ex|pre&s;s terms of the French treaty, the contraband goods alone are to be condemned, but neither the &s;hips which carry them, nor the re&s;t of the cargo. This decree howe|ver, makes both the &s;hips and the whole cargo liable to condemnation; and con&s;equently is a direct and formal violation of the law of nations, and the treaty between us and France. The decree does not &s;ay expre&s;sly, that the re&s;t of the cargo &s;hall be condemned; but it is un|der&s;tood in that manner by the French agents in the We&s;t-Indies, and in that manner executed.</P>
<P>The law of nations and the treaty, moreover, make contraband goods liable to condemnation in the &s;ingle ca&s;e only where being &s;ent to one party at war, they are taken by the other. But this decree &s;ubjects them to capture in all ca&s;es, whether bound to French or Eng|li&s;h ports, and with them the &s;hips and cargoes.</P>
<P>On the 27th of November 1796, the French com|mi&s;&s;ioners at Cape Francois pa&s;&s;ed a decree authorizing the armed &s;hips and privateers of France to capture all American ve&s;&s;els <HI>bound to or from Engli&s;h ports.</HI> This
<PB N="71" REF="032226_0072_0FF19AAAF3BB1290">decree was founded on the act of the Directory, declar|ing that France would treat neutrals as they &s;uffered them&s;elves to be treated by the Engli&s;h; but this act, iniquitous as it was, did not ju&s;tify the decree; for at the time of pa&s;&s;ing the one and the other, the orders of the Briti&s;h for the capture of neutral ve&s;&s;els bound to French ports, had long cea&s;ed to exi&s;t.</P>
<P>It is to be ob&s;erved moreover, that tho&s;e orders never went as far as this decree.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t, tho&s;e of June 8th, 1793; directed <Q>all ve&s;&s;els laden wholly or in part with <HI>corn, flour, or meal,</HI> and bound <HI>to</HI> any port in France, or occupied by the arms of France, to be brought in, and the corn, flour, or meal, to be purcha&s;ed and paid for with freight.</Q> But the decree orders all American ve&s;&s;els, whatever may be their lading, bound <HI>to</HI> or <HI>from</HI> Briti&s;h ports to be captured.</P>
<P>The orders of the 6th of November 1793, directed all &s;hips laden with goods, <HI>the produce of any colony be|longing to France,</HI> or carrying <HI>provi&s;ions</HI> or <HI>other &s;upplies</HI> for the u&s;e of <HI>&s;uch colony,</HI> to be brought in for adjudica|tion. Even this falls &s;hort of the decree; which directs all American ve&s;&s;els, bound to or from Briti&s;h ports, and <HI>however laden,</HI> to be captured.</P>
<P>On the 8th of January, 1794; the&s;e obnoxious or|ders of November 6th were repealed, and in&s;tead of them, it was ordered that all &s;hips of the following de|&s;cription &s;hould be brought in for adjudication. 1&s;t. Ships with their cargoes laden, with the produce of the French i&s;lands, and bound directly from thence to any port in Europe. 2d. Ships with their cargoes laded with French property, being the produce of tho&s;e i&s;lands, and bound to any place. 3d. Ships attempting to en|ter any blockaded port in tho&s;e i&s;lands; and 4th. Ships bound to any port there, and laden, in whole or in part, with naval or military &s;tores. The&s;e la&s;t orders, tho' extremely outrageous, and a clear infraction of the law of nations, &s;till fell far &s;hort of the French decree, which con&s;igns to capture all our ve&s;&s;els indi&s;criminately, bound to or from any Briti&s;h port, in America, Europe, or el&s;ewhere. They, as well as the preceding ones,
<PB N="72" REF="032226_0073_0FF19AADFB7D9958">have all been long ago countermanded, and the Briti&s;h have engaged to make compen&s;ation for the acts done under them.</P>
<P>The&s;e orders were further di&s;tingui&s;hed from the French decree in que&s;tion by another equally important circum&s;tance. They extend to <HI>all neutral</HI> ve&s;&s;els alike; whereas the decree is confined &s;olely to <HI>American</HI> ve&s;|&s;els: which proves that it is not, like the Briti&s;h orders, a mea&s;ure of general policy towards all neutral &s;tates, but of particular re&s;entment and ho&s;tility again&s;t us. It is moreover in direct violation of a treaty, which was not the ca&s;e with the Briti&s;h orders. The Briti&s;h too had &s;ome provocation, and made us no profe&s;&s;ions of friend&s;hip. We had celebrated their defeats and tho&s;e of their allies, by univer&s;al rejoicings; and had &s;hewn their enemies every mark of public good will, and pri|vate affection. The direct contrary of all this took place towards France, and yet &s;he has treated us abun|dantly wor&s;e.</P>
<P>This decree however of the commi&s;&s;ioners at Cape Francois, unju&s;t and injurious as it is, falls &s;hort of one &s;ince adopted by the French agents at Guada|loupe. On the fir&s;t of February 1797, they decreed that all neutral ve&s;&s;els bound to any port in the We&s;t Indies, which had been delivered up to the Engli&s;h and was occupied and defended by the Emigrants; and all neutral ve&s;&s;els cleared out for the We&s;t Indies <HI>generally,</HI> &s;hould be liable to capture and condemnation.</P>
<P>The French government has never publickly confirm|ed or acknowledged the&s;e decrees; but it has never di&s;ap|proved, much le&s;s countermanded them: and they are carried into execution with every circum&s;tance of in&s;ult and injury. The ve&s;&s;els taken are &s;ent into one port, their papers into another, and the captains and crews into a third. When brought to trial, nothing is heard in favour of the owners; and indeed as the papers and captains are &s;ent to another place, there is often no per&s;on to make a de&s;ence, nor any means of &s;upporting it. Ve&s;&s;els bound to neutral, and even French ports, are often taken and condemned copies of the condem|nation are generally refu&s;ed: the captains and crews
<PB N="73" REF="032226_0074_0FF19AB1154AF938">are &s;ometimes beaten, always left de&s;titute of &s;ub&s;is|tance, and generally confined, as pri&s;oners of war, in dungeons or on board of pri&s;on &s;hips; where a mi&s;erable and &s;canty allowance of the wor&s;t food, &s;carcely &s;uffices to prolong their &s;ufferings.</P>
<P>The number of &s;hips taken, as far as has yet been a&s;certained, is above two hundred and fifty: there is no accurate amount either of the value of property, or the number of &s;eamen.</P>
<P>The&s;e are &s;ome of the marks of "ju&s;t di&s;plea&s;ure," whereby France reminds us that &s;he is <Q>terrible to her enemies,</Q> and admoni&s;hes our government <Q>to return to it&s;elf,</Q> to conform to her orders!</P>
<P>In the mean time, as &s;oon as the Pre&s;ident was in|formed by the di&s;patches from our Mini&s;ter at Paris, which have been already mentioned, that the French government expre&s;&s;ed &s;erious di&s;content at the mea&s;ures we had pur&s;ued, he re&s;olved to &s;end a new Mini&s;ter, for the expre&s;s and &s;pecial purpo&s;e, as his credentials declared, <Q>of bani&s;hing &s;u&s;picions, effacing unfavor|able impre&s;&s;ions, and re&s;toring harmony.</Q> General Pinckney was &s;elected for this purpo&s;e, not only on aceount of his talents and great re&s;pectability of charac|ter, but al&s;o for his known good will to France, and warm attachment to her cau&s;e. He &s;ailed from Char|le&s;ton in Augu&s;t 1796, and having &s;topped at Philadel|phia for his in&s;tructions, arrived at Paris in December following, and laid his credentials before the Directory.</P>
<P>The Directory however refu&s;ed to receive him as Mini&s;ter, and informed his predece&s;&s;or, who&s;e letters of recal had been pre&s;ented at the &s;ame time, <HI>that they had determined not to receive another Mini&s;ter Plenipotentiary from the United States till after the redre&s;s of grievances demanded from the American government, and which France had a right to expect.</HI> This was &s;aying in plain and expre&s;s terms, <Q>we will hear nothing from you, till you have fir&s;t &s;ubmitted to our will as already made known to you.</Q></P>
<P>They even refu&s;ed him cards of ho&s;pitality by which alone, according to their laws, his per&s;on could be pro|tected from arre&s;t; and told him verbally thro' his
<PB N="74" REF="032226_0075_0FF19AB34341F430">&s;ecretary, that they expected him to leave the coun|try. They went &s;o far as to intimate, that if he did not depart he &s;hould be arre&s;ted. With becoming firmne&s;s and dignity, however, he declared that he would rely on the protection of the Law of Nations, and mu&s;t remain at his po&s;t, till he had received a written order to leave it, whereby he might be ju&s;tified to his own government. This order they perfi&s;ted in refu&s;ing, till they heard of Buonaparte's la&s;t victory in Italy. The day after that intelligence arrived, which was towards the la&s;t of January, General Pinckney received a written order to quit France. He imme|diately went to Holland, where he now remains wait|ing for new in&s;tructions.</P>
<P>Thus has France not only refu&s;ed to li&s;ten to our explanations till we &s;ubmit implicitly to her will, but driven from her territory with ignominy and in&s;ult a mini&s;ter &s;ent, like a me&s;&s;enger of peace, for the ex|pre&s;s purpo&s;e of <Q>removing unfavorable impre&s;&s;ions and re&s;toring harmony.</Q></P>
<P>This to u&s;e the language of the Pre&s;ident in his late manly and patriotic &s;peech to Congre&s;s, <Q>is to treat us neither as allies, nor as friends, nor as a &s;overeign &s;tate.</Q></P>
<P>Pur&s;uing &s;till the &s;ame &s;y&s;tem, the Directory on the 2d of March la&s;t, publi&s;hed a decree, whereby our treaty with France is expre&s;sly violated in two impor|tant points, under pretence of a&s;&s;imilating it to that with Britain: And it is further declared <Q>that every American who &s;hall hold a commi&s;&s;ion from the ene|mies of France, as well as every &s;eaman of that na|tion, compo&s;ing the crew of the &s;hips or ve&s;&s;els (of tho&s;e enemies I &s;uppo&s;e) &s;hall by <HI>this fact alone</HI> be de|clared piratical and treated as &s;uch without &s;uffering the party to e&s;tabli&s;h, that the act was the con&s;equence of threats or violence.</Q></P>
<P>This la&s;t regulation worthy in bloodine&s;s and inju&s;|tice, of a country who&s;e citizens have butchered two hundred and fifty thou&s;and women, carried infants to be drowned, &s;tuck on the points of &s;pears, and chopt off the hands of mothers &s;tretched out for mercy

Our treaty with France contains preci&s;ely the &s;ame &s;tipulation; &s;o al&s;o do tho&s;e with Holland, Pru&s;&s;ia, and Sweden. It is found in almo&s;t every treaty, and means no more in our ca&s;e, than that if our citizens take commi&s;&s;ions from a foreign power to privateer again&s;t people with whom we are at peace, and &s;hould fall into their hands, we will not interfere in their behalf. It extends only to our own citizens, not to tho&s;e of France; to &s;uch as take <HI>commi&s;&s;ions</HI> to <HI>privateer,</HI> not to &s;ailors, even on board of privateers, nor to per&s;ons having commi&s;&s;ions in public &s;hips of war; not to puni&s;hment which we en|gage to inflict, but to &s;uch as tho&s;e who take our citi|zens in the&s;e unlawful pur&s;uits, may inflict, without our interpo&s;ing for its prevention.</P>
<P>And in revenge for this wi&s;e, equitable, and almo&s;t univer&s;al arrangement, which, tho' it now offends France by preventing in &s;ome degree our &s;eamen from augmenting her marine, &s;he her&s;elf entered into with us long before we made it with Great Britain, the French government has declared, not that in ca&s;e of our being engaged in war, her citizens &s;hall not take commi&s;&s;ions from us to privateer again&s;t our enemies, which would be the utmo&s;t extent of ju&s;t retaliation, but that &s;he will treat as pirates all &s;uch of our citizens, whether with or without commi&s;&s;ions, as &s;hall be found on board of her enemies ve&s;&s;els, whether public &s;hips of war or priva|teers;

<P>Thus if an American &s;eaman, has the misfortune of being impre&s;&s;ed by a Briti&s;h &s;hip, he is liable to be hanged for it by France! Such is the conduct of a nati|on which perpetually proclaims its own ju&s;tice and mag|nanimity, and boa&s;ts of being "generous to its allies."</P>
<P>This decree it might have been &s;uppo&s;ed, would fill up the mea&s;ure of unprovoked and in&s;olent aggre&s;&s;ion. But no! not content with acting thus towards us her|&s;elf, France has endeavoured to excite the Dutch and Spaniards again&s;t us likewi&s;e. The poor humiliated dependant Dutch, afraid to refu&s;e, begged off for a while, and were excu&s;ed. Her attempts however, in all appearance, have been renewed, and as &s;he has 25000 troops in their country, there is little probabi|lity of their being able to hold out. As for Spain, &s;he has come into the mea&s;ure; her mini&s;ter has lately pre|&s;ented a memorial containing the complaints of his Ca|tholic maje&s;ty: the&s;e complaints are, for the mo&s;t part, an echo to tho&s;e of France. There is one however, peculiar to Spain, the manife&s;t and even ridiculous fu|tility of which, may be taken as an example of all the re&s;t. Spain has been made to complain of the Briti&s;h treaty as an infraction of that concluded lately with her: notwith&s;tanding this Briti&s;h treaty was prior in ratification by more than ten months.</P>
<P>Thus in ca&s;e we are driven to a war with France, are tho&s;e two nations to be compelled to join her, as they have done in that again&s;t Great Britain. Their fate in both will no doubt be the &s;ame. It will be out of their &s;poils that we al&s;o, like Britain, &s;hall take our indemni|fication; and this affords a complete and mo&s;t u&s;eful example of the arbitrary and &s;elfi&s;h conduct of France towards tho&s;e powers whom &s;he can frighten or &s;educe into her mea&s;ures. She compels them to form an alli|ance, for which they pay with mo&s;t of their wealth and a part of their territories; and then &s;he forces them to join her in wars, wherein having no po&s;&s;ible intere&s;t,

<P>That her object from the beginning has been to draw us into the war, is manife&s;t, not only from the in&s;truc|tions to Genet, and the corre&s;pondence of his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, but al&s;o from the mea&s;ures them&s;elves, which &s;he wi&s;hed us to adopt, from the plan of aggrandizement we &s;ee her pur&s;uing in Europe, and from her uniform conduct towards other countries.</P>
<P>As to Mr. Genet's in&s;tructions, they are full and ex|plicit; they go directly to the object, and point out, not un&s;kilfully, the means whereby it was to be effected. This nobody has denied; but &s;ome have been of opinion, that when he was recalled, the &s;y&s;tem was abandoned.</P>

<PB N="79" REF="032226_0080_0FF19AC593C24210">fir&s;t place, that we &s;hould compel Britain to relinqui&s;h the right of taking enemies goods on board of neutral &s;hips. This right &s;he knew, that Britain had always refu&s;ed to relinqui&s;h in time of war; even in the Ame|rican war, when &s;he &s;tood alone again&s;t the United States, France, Spain, and Holland; and when Ru&s;|&s;ia, Sweden, Denmark, Pru&s;&s;ia, and the Han&s;e towns, had formed an a&s;&s;ociation to repel the right. She had never, of late years at lea&s;t, renounced it even in peace, except to France her&s;elf in 1786; and then &s;he receiv|ed very great equivalents. For us therefore, to in&s;i&s;t on her relinqui&s;hment of this right, during &s;uch a war as the pre&s;ent, wherein her very exi&s;tance is &s;taked on the &s;upport of her maritime &s;uperiority and the extent of her commerce, France well knew would be a vain attempt, which if per&s;evered in, mu&s;t infallibly end in war. On this point therefore, &s;he in&s;i&s;ted with un|wearied and importunate per&s;everance; and made it the grand hinge of all her complaints.</P>
<P>So al&s;o, as to the impre&s;s of &s;eamen: &s;he well knew that Britain claimed the right of impre&s;&s;ing &s;uch of our &s;eamen as having been her &s;ubjects at the conclu&s;ion of the revolution war, had &s;ince that time come to &s;ettle in this country. This was a right liable to abu&s;e in|deed, and very much abu&s;ed, but too important to Eng|land, in a maritime war, to be relinqui&s;hed. This France well knew, and accordingly &s;he required us to compel the relinqui&s;hment; an attempt to effect which mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity have brought on a quarrel.</P>
<P>She further required us to admit a con&s;truction of the treaty with her, whereby &s;he would have been per|mitted to arm ve&s;&s;els, enli&s;t crews, and &s;ell prizes in our ports, capture Briti&s;h ve&s;&s;els within our juri&s;diction, and exclude every Briti&s;h &s;hip of war from our har|bours. To this partiality, &s;o advantageous to her, and &s;o hurtful to her enemy, and in no wi&s;e intended by the treaty, &s;he well knew that Britain would not pati|ently &s;ubmit; for the latter had already begun to com|plain. Had we in compliance with the importunate and clamorous demands of France, adopted this &s;y&s;tem, there is no doubt that Britain would have oppo&s;ed it;
<PB N="80" REF="032226_0081_0FF19AC723FB1AF8">for a proud and angry rival is not apt to &s;ee without di&s;content, favours injurious to it&s;elf gratuitou&s;ly ac|corded to its opponent. Hence abundant matter for a quarrel mu&s;t have ari&s;en. All this France knew, and the urged the demand with encrea&s;ing earne&s;tne&s;s.</P>
<P>The&s;e were the leading mea&s;ures required of us by France, and they all had an obvious and nece&s;&s;ary tenden|cy to bring about a war: a tendency whereof it was im|po&s;&s;ible for her to be ignorant. Hence the eagerne&s;s with which &s;he pur&s;ued them, and her vexation and re|&s;entment at &s;eeing them defeated. The &s;ame tenden|cy, tho' not in all ca&s;es equally &s;trong, may be perceived in all her other &s;teps.</P>
<P>But it will be impo&s;&s;ible to under&s;tand fully the views of France in this country, without attending a little to her projects in Europe.</P>
<P>It is perfectly well known, that &s;he long &s;ince form|ed, and &s;till pur&s;ues with the mo&s;t &s;teady per&s;everance, a &s;y&s;tem of aggrandizement in Europe, for en&s;uring the &s;ucce&s;s of which, it is ab&s;olutely e&s;&s;ential that the ma|ritime power of England &s;hould be reduced. Germa|ny oppo&s;ed barriers to her by land, which were al&s;o to be removed. Accordingly Germany was to be divided and a maritime coalition formed again&s;t England. Of this coalition the United States were to form an im|portant part; for though we had no navy, it was known that we had the means of &s;peedily forming one, and that when once engaged in the war we &s;hould be obliged to exert them. The great number of our mer|chant &s;hips, in the mean time, the &s;kill, numbers, and enterprizing character of our &s;eamen, the abundance of provi&s;ions and naval &s;tores in our country, the conve|nience of our harbours, and above all our vicinity to the We&s;t Indies, where the commerce and navy of England are mo&s;t ea&s;ily &s;u&s;ceptible of a deep and deadly wound, would have rendered us a mo&s;t important ally in a ma|ritime war again&s;t that power. To out off our com|merce with her at the &s;ame time, the importance wherof to her, though certainly great, has been far over|rated by France, would greatly aid the blow.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="032226_0082_0FF19AC8D5DF0B78">
Accordingly we find that as &s;oon as the republic and the power of the Jacobin leaders were e&s;tabli&s;hed, and before the war with England commenced, Mr. Genet was &s;ent out with expre&s;s in&s;tructions to bring about this alliance; and I have been a&s;&s;ured by a gentleman who about that time acted a con&s;iderable part in the convention, but has &s;ince vi&s;ited America, that this maritime coalition was early devi&s;ed, and that <Q>nothing was wanting to its completion but the con&s;ent of the United States.</Q> "That con&s;ent," he added, with an air of re&s;entment which four years have not been a|ble to allay, <HI>"was applied for and was refu&s;ed."</HI></P>
<P>In this refu&s;al, and in that proclamation of neutrality again&s;t which the mini&s;ters of France have never cea&s;ed to cry out, from Genet who &s;aid <Q>it was a breach of the treaty,</Q> to Adet who brands it as "in&s;idious," was laid the foundation of our pre&s;ent quarrel with France. She did not however begin the quarrel im|mediately; for &s;he &s;till entertained hopes of drawing us gradually into the war by fomenting our ancient diffe|rences with England, and prevailing on us, under the pretext of fulfilling our obligations by treaty and the laws of neutrality, to adopt mea&s;ures which her an|tagoni&s;t would not have failed, and ju&s;tly too, to con|&s;ider as ho&s;tile. When &s;he &s;aw the&s;e efforts con&s;tantly baffled by the firm prudence of our government, and all her hopes of a quarrel finally extingui&s;hed by the treaty with Britain, &s;he then &s;uffered her re&s;entment to blaze out in the mea&s;ures which &s;he now pur&s;ues.</P>
<P>In the mean time, the plan went on in Europe, and was pur&s;ued with varying &s;ucce&s;s, but undeviating per&s;everance: nor did it receive the lea&s;t check or al|teration from the frequent changes of government in France. Various factions wi&s;hed to rule at home, and in their &s;truggles for power, &s;laughtered each other without remor&s;e or forbearance: but they all had the &s;ame object as to their neighbours; and that object was aggrandizement to France at their expence.</P>
<P>They began with Germany, which being neare&s;t to them, it was nece&s;&s;ary fir&s;t to cripple. They con&s;ider|ed it likewi&s;e as the mo&s;t vulnerable, by the two wea|pons
<PB N="82" REF="032226_0083_0FF19ACA9785AEC8">wherewith they meant to a&s;&s;ail all Europe. Tho&s;e weapons were <HI>divi&s;ion and in&s;urrection.</HI> Mr. Fauchet, in his intercepted di&s;patch, has informed us that France had an eye to the u&s;e that might be made of them here al&s;o.</P>
<P>Germany is compo&s;ed of a great number of indepen|dent powers, &s;ome of them very incon&s;iderable, and all held very loo&s;ely together by a kind of league, at the head of which is the emperor. Au&s;tria, which com|po&s;es the peculiar dominions of the emperor, is by far the mo&s;t powerful of the German &s;tates, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed al&s;o of very exten&s;ive dominions out of Germany, e&s;pe|cially in Italy and Belgium. Pru&s;&s;ia comes next, which tho' formerly incon&s;iderable, was rai&s;ed by the talents and long reign of the late king to a very high pitch of power and importance. This power regards it&s;elf as the rival of Au&s;tria, again&s;t which it entertains a jealou&s;y mixt with re&s;entment and dread. The&s;e two great powers mutually balance and controul each other in the affairs of Germany; and the &s;maller &s;tates adhere &s;ome to the one, and &s;ome to the other, as general policy or par|ticular motives may happen to dictate.</P>
<P>It is ea&s;y to &s;ee how abundantly the &s;eeds of divi&s;i|on are &s;own in this &s;y&s;tem. The&s;e were al&s;o circum|&s;tances which &s;eemed to favour the plan of exciting in&s;urrection.</P>
<P>All the governments of Germany, except a few towns, were arbitrary in their form; and &s;ome of them very oppre&s;&s;ive in their practice: and altho the appa|rent vices of the&s;e governments were greatly corrected by mild cu&s;toms and fixt laws for the &s;ecurity of per&s;on and property, which could not ea&s;ily be violated; yet there, as in all other countries where a va&s;t population, and its certain con&s;equence great inequality of conditions, have taken place, there were great numbers, who po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ing little, and obliged to gain their &s;ub&s;i&s;tance by con&s;tant labour, would naturally look with an eye of di&s;content on the wealth and privileges of the &s;uperior cla&s;&s;es. It was by this de&s;cription of people that France meant to work. It was by exciting them to in&s;urrection, that the per&s;ons who then directed her affairs, had en|&s;laved
<PB N="83" REF="032226_0084_0FF19AD1CBE499F8">&s;laved their own country, after overturning a govern|ment e&s;tabli&s;hed by free and general con&s;ent; and it was by the &s;ame engine that they intended to &s;ubjugate Germany, having fir&s;t &s;ubverted and trampled under foot tho&s;e governments whereby her force had been united and directed.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who had nothing, were to be the in&s;truments abroad, as they had been at home; and they were to be &s;et to work by pointing to the plunder of tho&s;e who had &s;omething. Their exertions were to be aided by large bodies of French troops drawn to the frontiers, and held in readine&s;s to profit by circum&s;tances. To repel &s;ome &s;mall a&s;&s;emblages of French emigrants, whom the Emperor him&s;elf had compelled to di&s;per&s;e, was the pretext for the&s;e armaments; meanwhile every ex|pedient of fraud and di&s;&s;imulation was u&s;ed to lull the vigilance of the German &s;tates, and enflame their re|&s;entments and jealou&s;ies again&s;t each other.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The French carried this diffimulation &s;o far, as to a&s;&s;ure the Em|peror, that they abhorred the idea of exciting commotions; and when Eng|land afterwards complained of their mea&s;ures for this purpo&s;e, they a&s;&s;ur|ed her that tho&s;e mea&s;ures were not meant to affect her, but were <HI>exclu&s;ively intended again&s;t A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">&s;tria, and Pru&s;&s;ia!</HI> See the corre&s;pondence.
<P>Nothing can be more inconte&s;tible than the po&s;ition, that France was the aggre&s;&s;or in the pre&s;ent war. Any one who will read the corre&s;pondence between the courts of France and Vienna, will find that before the Au&s;|trians and Pru&s;&s;ians began to arm, or took any ho&s;tile mea&s;ures of any kind, France threatened and alarmed Germany and the low countries by great military preparations on their frontiers. This was not denied by France, but &s;he ju&s;tified it under various pretexts. One was, the nece&s;&s;ity of re|pelling the emigrants. But the forces collected were ten, perhaps twen|ty times more numerous than the emigrants who were collecting in arms. The Emperor had moreover forbidden them to a&s;&s;emble in arms on his territory. He had actually compelled them to di&s;per&s;e; and had induced the German princes in the neighbourhood of France to adopt the &s;ame &s;y&s;tem. Some &s;mall corps of emigrants did notwith&s;tanding remain in arms in different places, but not on the Emperors' territories; and they were too incon&s;iderable to give any alarm to France. Another pretext was, the convention of Pilnitz; but this convention was in its very nature defen|&s;ive and eventual. It was an agreement between the emperor and the king of Pru&s;&s;ia, that if either of them &s;hould experience tho&s;e attacks from France wherewith they were threatened, they would a&s;&s;i&s;t each other; and moreover, that they would protect the king of France from per&s;onal vio|lence. They did not arm in &s;upport of this convention; and as &s;oon as the king gave his a&s;&s;ent to the con&s;titution, and declared him&s;elf free, they &s;u&s;pended the convention by a public declaration. Another pretext was, that the emperor had &s;ent additional troops into &s;ome of his frontier dominions, and had directed one of his generals to march to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a certain German prince &s;hould he be attacked. But the emperor had a right and was al&s;o bound, to a&s;&s;i&s;t the German &s;tates if attacked; and as to the additional troops, they did not exceed four thou&s;and, the u&s;ual compli|ment of recruits &s;ent annually to his peace e&s;tabli&s;hment in that quar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">er: while France had drawn a large army to the &s;ame quarter. The&s;e facts were &s;tated on the part of Au&s;tria in the corre&s;pondence, and no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> denied by France. A fourth pretext was, that the emperor gave protection to the emigrants; but he gave them an a&s;&s;ylum only and ho&s;pitality, with an expre&s;s prohibition to arm on his territories. France demanded of him to reduce his troops, while &s;he expre&s;sly refu&s;ed to reduce hers, to drive away the emigrants, and to abandon the convention of Pilnitz; and be|cau&s;e he refu&s;ed to comply with the&s;e demands, &s;he declared war again&s;t him. The &s;ame happened with re&s;pect to Pru&s;&s;ia.</P>
<P>The French mini&s;ter who was at Vienna, when the war broke out, declared it as his opinion, <HI>that the &s;y&s;tem of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> or war pacific.</HI> Mr. De Le&s;&s;arts who was mini&s;ter for Foreign Affairs in France at the &s;ame time, and who carried on the corre&s;pondence which preceded the war again&s;t Au&s;|tria and Pru&s;&s;ia, wrote a letter afterwards to Mr. Neckar, in which he de|clares <Q>that it was clear to demon&s;tration, that they (the Au&s;trians and Pru&s;&s;ians) were unwilling to make war again&s;t France; that it was evi|dent from unan&s;werable proof, that France provoked them to ho&s;tilities, and &s;et all Europe again&s;t her.</Q> See Necka<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">s addre&s;s to the French people in behalf of Louis the &s;ixteenth, wherein this letter from De Le&s;|&s;arts is cited.</P>
<P>The te&s;timony of Bri&s;&s;ot to the &s;ame point, will perhaps be thought worthy by &s;ome of more credit. When accu&s;ing the French king in the Convention, of want of fidelity to the nation, he charged him with <HI>unwil|lingne&s;s to attack Au&s;tria,</HI> and exclaimed "we," meaning him&s;elf and his party, "compelled him to declare war, in order to put him to the te&s;t." After the king was dethroned, Bri&s;&s;ot ju&s;tified the war, and took the cre|dit of it to him&s;elf and his friends. "Without the war, &s;ays he in his gazette of September 22d 1792, the revolution of the 10th of Augu&s;t would never have taken place; without the war, France would never have been a republic," and in h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s addre&s;s to his con&s;tituents (page 56) he declares "that the war with Au&s;tria was forced on France by outrages and threats, and that to en&s;ure &s;ucce&s;s, the was <HI>obliged to begin it.</HI>" It has al|ready appeared what the&s;e "outrages and threats" were, and we have the te&s;timony of Bri&s;&s;ot him&s;elf that it was not by them that the war with Au&s;tria was rendered nece&s;&s;ary, tho' they were u&s;ed as the pretexts. It was to bring about the revolution of the 10th of Augu&s;t; to give the Bri&s;|&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">tine party arms, wherewith they might de&s;troy the king and con&s;titution, and afterwards rule the nation under pretence of e&s;tabli&s;hing a republic. In the mean time it being clear that every man's te&s;timony is good again&s;t him&s;elf, we mu&s;t believe on that of Bri&s;&s;ot, that he and his party <HI>began the war again&s;t Au&s;tria.</HI></P>
<P>As to Holland, they declared war again&s;t her, without ceremony or pre|tence; except that &s;eeing her frontiers approached by war, &s;he had taken &s;ome precautions purely defen&s;ive. They even violated her acknowledged rights before &s;he began tho&s;e precautions.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to England, it is perfectly certain that France was the agre&s;&s;or; be&s;ides the facts and papers, which &s;peak for them&s;elves, the point is e&s;tabli&s;hed by the po&s;itive te&s;timony of three French writers, all well informed, and two of whom acted a very con&s;iderable part in the re|volution and in the war. The&s;e are Calonne, Bri&s;&s;ot, and Dumourier; all of whom affirm that France attacked England. Bri&s;&s;ot was a leading mem|ber of the Convention at that time, and when he was afterwards brought to the block, one of the charges again&s;t him was, his having been the au|thor of the attack. He replied that Robe&s;pierre's party were the authors of it: but he did not &s;ay that France was not the aggre&s;&s;or, which would have been a complete ju&s;tification. On the contrary, he a&s;&s;erted that France was the aggre&s;&s;or mo&s;t unwi&s;ely, and that Robe&s;pierre's party had induced her to become &s;o. In his appeal to his con&s;tituents, he &s;ays the &s;ame thing over and over: In this appeal (page 47) he expre&s;sly a&s;&s;erts, that England <HI>did not begin to arm till three months after France.</HI> He al&s;o &s;ays (page 60) "that a determination had been made to brave all Europe."</P>
<P>In October 1792, the Convention, as appears by the &s;ame authority, had ordered formidable naval equipments to be made <HI>in the expectation of a war with the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters">time powers.</HI> This was previous to mo&s;t, if not all, of tho&s;e acts on the part of England, which France made the grounds of her declaration of war.</P>
<P>Damourier loudly charges the Convention with having driven England into the war, which he repeatedly declares might ea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ily have been avoided.</P>
<P>See his life 3d vol. containing the hi&s;tory of his campaigns.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t at the &s;ame time be admitted, that altho' the combined powers were attacked and driven into the war in their own defence, yet, when they found them&s;elves engaged in it, and began to entertain pro&s;pects of &s;ucce&s;s, they al&s;o began to form projects of aggrandi&s;ement at the expence of France. It is al&s;o highly probable that mo&s;t of the powerful governments became very little aver&s;e from war, when they found rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e that France by her internal commotions, and the univer&s;al indignation which the execution of the king and the murders at Paris had excited again&s;t her, had become an ea&s;y prey. It is not however, the le&s;s true, that France began the war, particularly again&s;t Holland and England, which for a long time &s;hewed every appearance of de&s;iring peace.</P></NOTE></P>

<P>The Emperor's dominions in Belgium, being at a great di&s;tance from his other territories, and in the clo&s;e
<PB N="86" REF="032226_0087_0FF19AD8A2596560">neighbourhood of France, were expo&s;ed to an imme|diate and ea&s;y attack. They were al&s;o thought more obnoxious to the weapon of <HI>in&s;urrection</HI> than any other country; for tho' they enjoyed the free&s;t con&s;titution of any people on the continent of Europe, except the Swi&s;s and Dutch, &s;ome inva&s;ions of their rights at|tempted by a former Emperor, had planted deep the &s;eeds of di&s;content and di&s;tru&s;t. The&s;e attempts had been given up by Au&s;tria, but the jealou&s;y and re&s;ent|ment in&s;pired by them, were far from being extingui&s;h|ed. The&s;e &s;parks it was the care of France to fan by emi&s;&s;aries and promi&s;es; and when her armies entered the country, they were preceded by declarations that they came as the friends of the people, to a&s;&s;i&s;t them in breaking the chains of their ancient tyrants.</P>
<P>We have already &s;een what kind of friend&s;hip it was which they had for the Belgians, and how the chains of this deluded people have been broken. They have been plundered of every thing they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed to repleni&s;h the trea&s;ury of France, drained of all their re&s;ources to &s;upport her armies, and are now &s;ubject to a military government.</P>
<P>England for a while was let alone: It was not the &s;ea&s;on yet for attacking her, till Au&s;tria and Pru&s;&s;ia &s;hould be exhau&s;ted, Holland &s;ubjugated, and Belgi|um annext to France. The maritime coalition, moreover, had not yet been formed; con&s;equently the plan again&s;t England was not yet ripe. Corre&s;pondence in the mean time was kept up with the revolutioni&s;ts in England and Ireland, open encouragement was held out to them, and their deputations had public audiences from the French convention.</P>
<P>The Briti&s;h government was alarmed at the&s;e mea|&s;ures. It al&s;o took umbrage at the proceedings in Bel|gium, and the attacks made on Holland, with which la&s;t it was in alliance. It complained of the&s;e attacks, and of the decrees whereby the Convention had made a formal promi&s;e of &s;upport to the in&s;urgents of every country. The Convention ju&s;tified the attacks on Hol|land, and a&s;&s;ured England that the decrees had been mi&s;under&s;tood; that they meant nothing at which any
<PB N="87" REF="032226_0088_0FF19ADB942B19E8">government ought to be offended, and were only to be executed in ca&s;es where a whole people having re&s;olved to change their government, &s;hould call for the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of France.

<P>England in the mean time, ju&s;tly con&s;idering the&s;e explanations as deceptive and un&s;atisfactory, went on with her preparations for the defence of her&s;elf and her ally. France required her to de&s;i&s;t; and when &s;he refu&s;ed, and &s;ent away a mini&s;ter who employed him&s;elf in exciting &s;edition, war was declared again&s;t her.

The reply to Bri&s;&s;ot's addre&s;s by Camile De&s;moulins, in behalf of the Robe&s;perrian party &s;hould al&s;o be con&s;ulted; and Necker's addre&s;s to the French in behalf of Louis the &s;ixteenth.

It was the intere&s;t of France to monopolize as it were, the&s;e va&s;t implements of trade, the&s;e manufactories of national pro&s;per<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">|ty. It was the intere&s;t of France to weaken her mortal enemy (the Empetor) to cramp his efforts, <HI>to aggrandize her&s;elf with his &s;poils:</HI> in &s;hort to m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">late the colo&s;&s;us of Au&s;tria, by rending from him the&s;e fertile provinces of Belgium, for obtaining and &s;ecuring the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of which, he has for ages been lavi&s;h of gold, of blood, and of in|trigues.</Q>
<P>Thus al&s;o it was the intere&s;t of France to mutilate the colo&s;&s;us of En|gland, by rending from him the colonies in America. And yet &s;he tells us and the Belgians of her <HI>di&s;intere&s;ted &s;ervices</HI> in giving our independence.</P>
<P>"England and Pre&s;&s;ia," continues Chau&s;&s;ard, in the words of a &s;peech which had been delivered in the Convention, and approved of by it, <Q>know very well that France had the greate&s;t intere&s;t to &s;ub&s;titute a popular and repre&s;entative government for the ari&s;tocratic and degenerate one that actually exi&s;ts in Holland: that <HI>with the forces</HI> of that country, France would <HI>irrecoverably de&s;troy the trade of England,</HI> and by means of her navy &s;oon command the Baltic; that all that would be wanting would be the renewal in that part of the North, of an alliance of &s;itua|tion then become nece&s;&s;ary; and that an intimate union between France and Holland being once formed, <HI>the &s;uprem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">y of the Engli&s;h trade both in the Ea&s;t and We&s;t Indies would rapi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ty di&s;appear;</HI> while Pru&s;&s;i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> on her &s;ide would irrecoverably loo&s;e, &s;ooner or later, all her po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions in We&s;tphalia</Q></P>
<P>Here the plan &s;tands confe&s;&s;ed, The Emperor was to be &s;tript in Belgium, and the king of Pru&s;&s;ia in We&s;tphalia. The bank of England was to be ruined by operations in Holland, and a popular government &s;ub|&s;tituted in that country, in order to place its forces under the direction of France; and with the&s;e forces aided by her own, France was to de&s;troy irre|coverably the trade of England in Europe, and make its &s;upremacy both in the Ea&s;t and We&s;t Indies rapidly di&s;appear. And all this was to be ef|fected, by &s;etting &s;ire to the &s;oar corners of Europe, and exciting the people every where to in&s;urrect on again&s;t the government. It mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> a project &s;o atrocious in its end and &s;o abominable in its means has never been conceived before, not even by the Romans.</P>
<P>While all this was going on, the Convention, in order to hoodwink England, was making to her the mo&s;t &s;olemn a&s;&s;urances of pacific inten|tions. It even carried its di&s;&s;imulation to the almo&s;t incredible length of reque&s;ting the mediation of England to bring about a peace with Pru&s;&s;ia and the Emperor.</P>
<P>A further and a very &s;trong confirmation of the&s;e poin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s is found in the date of the in&s;tructions to Genet, the manife&s;t object of which was to bring the United States into a war again&s;t Great Britain.

In the cour&s;e of the war, means were found to de|t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ch the king of Pru&s;&s;ia by working on his avarice, excit|ing his ancient rival&s;hip and re&s;entment again&s;t the Hou&s;e of Au&s;tria, and tempting him with the pro&s;pect of a &s;hare in its &s;poils. The price of this defection lay long concealed in the &s;ecret articles of the treaty of peace: and the king of Pru&s;&s;ia remained quiet, being kept in awe by the Empre&s;s of Ru&s;&s;ia who threatened him in ca&s;e he &s;hould make any attempts again&s;t the Hou&s;e of Au&s;tria or the Germanic body.</P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="032226_0090_0FF19AE19BEBC808">
The Empre&s;s however being lately dead and her &s;ucce&s;|&s;or having adopted &s;ome mea&s;ures from which it was thought that weakne&s;s of character and incapacity might be inferred, if not a di&s;po&s;ition favourable to the views of France, the &s;ecret articles have come to light, and the king of Pru&s;&s;ia has a&s;&s;umed a very threat|ening tone and a&s;pect towards Au&s;tria. The Em|peror of Ru&s;&s;ia however, it is &s;aid, has given him to under&s;tand that he mu&s;t be quiet, or expect an attack from the whole force of the Ru&s;&s;ian empire. Thus much is certain, that his ho&s;tile movements have abated; and thus the plan of turning the force of Germany again&s;t it&s;elf, has once more been defeated.</P>
<P>Belgium has in the mean time been over-run, and Holland has been &s;ubdued, partly by force and partly by divi&s;ion: for France openly and avowedly rai&s;ed up and &s;upported a party again&s;t the government in the bo&s;om of the country, which was powerfully in&s;tru|mental in promoting her views. Spain al&s;o, too feeble and &s;piritle&s;s to defend it&s;elf, &s;unk under the arms of France, and has been compelled to join her in the war.</P>
<P>In this &s;ituation France finding her &s;chemes oppo&s;ed only by the va&s;t maritime power of England, and the unbroken courage and con&s;tancy of Au&s;tria, formed the re&s;olution of de&s;troying the commerce of England, thereby to cut of her pecuniary re&s;ources, and &s;ap the foundation of her naval &s;trength. This plan rendered the co-operation of the United States more important to her than ever; for &s;he con&s;iders us as one of England's be&s;t cu&s;tomers, and con&s;equently as the nation which contributes mo&s;t to the &s;upport of her commerce, her
<PB N="90" REF="032226_0091_0FF19AE410106188">manufactures, and her wealth. Our &s;ituation too in the neighbourhood of the We&s;t Indies, our abundance of provi&s;ions and of warlike and naval &s;tores, and the great number of our &s;hips and &s;eamen, would enable us to be very hurtful to England in war, as well as very u&s;eful in peace. By &s;uch a war indeed we &s;hould &s;uffer great|ly, but that is no part of the care of France.</P>
<P>Accordingly &s;he has uncea&s;ingly renewed, and pre&s;&s;ed with greater and greater eagerne&s;s, her indirect attempts to bring us into the war. Fore&s;eeing that her hopes of &s;ucce&s;s would be greatly le&s;&s;ened, if not wholly de&s;troy|ed by the treaty, &s;he oppo&s;ed it with all her might and in all its &s;tages. Even the uncon&s;titutional oppo&s;ition to it in the Hou&s;e of Repre&s;entatives, &s;he aided by every mean in her power. Finding all her attempts fi|nally fru&s;trated, her vexation and ill humour no longer knew any bounds, and &s;he re&s;olved to try different means for effecting what &s;he had in vain e&s;&s;ayed to bring about by intrigue.</P>
<P>That this is the true &s;pring of her conduct, that her anger at the Briti&s;h treaty does not ari&s;e from any of its particular provi&s;ions, but from its general tenden|cy to pre&s;erve peace between this country and Great Britain, is proved in the mo&s;t manife&s;t manner by the conduct &s;he pur&s;ues at this moment towards other neutral nations who have made no treaties with En|gland. She has long threatened Portugal with inva&s;ion by the Spaniards, unle&s;s &s;he will &s;hut her ports again&s;t the Engli&s;h. She has lately required Hamburg and Bremen to break off all commerce with England, and on their refu&s;al has recalled her mini&s;ter from Hamburg. She has made the &s;ame demand on Denmark; and even required the Danes to block up the mouth of the Elbe, a river not in their territories, again&s;t the Engli&s;h. We have not heard the pretext for the&s;e demands, which Denmark has pointedly refu&s;ed; but no doubt they were founded on the French con&s;truction of <HI>the laws of neutrality;</HI> the &s;ame laws whereby, according to France, the Swi&s;s were bound to drive the emigrants from their territories, and we to permit her to rai&s;e armies, equip &s;hips of war, and &s;ell prizes in ours.</P>

That &s;uch is the real project of France and the true &s;ource of her anger at the Briti&s;h treaty, is further prov|ed by the te&s;timony of General Pinckney, who having travelled thro' a great part of France, and continued near two months in Paris, had the be&s;t means of pene|trating their views. In his letter from Paris of Feb. 1&s;t. 1797, he &s;ays, <Q>I mo&s;t ardently wi&s;h that we would bani&s;h all party di&s;tinctions and foreign influence; and think and act only as Americans&mdash;for all parties in this country (France) unite in thinking that we ought to act <HI>as if we were altogether their dependants,</HI> and indebted to them &s;olely, and not to our own exertions, for our liberty and independence. <HI>Hence,</HI> our treaty with Great Britain is here generally exe|crated; and our having <HI>any kind of commercial connec|tion</HI> with that country, <HI>even if the treaty had not been made,</HI> would I believe, have been di&s;liked. They wi&s;h to de&s;troy the trade of England, and they look upon us as one of her be&s;t cu&s;tomers; <HI>and to obtain their object they care not what we &s;uffer.</HI></Q></P>
<P>This is the te&s;timony of a man remarkable for the warmth of his good wi&s;hes towards France, and who, if he did not di&s;like the Briti&s;h treaty, certainly never &s;aid a word in its favour. From his te&s;timony, as well as the evidence of their own conduct, it manife&s;tly ap|pears that their di&s;like to the treaty does not proceed, as they pretend, from any &s;tipulations in it injurious to them, but from its tendency to pre&s;erve an amicable intercour&s;e between us and England.</P>
<P>The united force of all the&s;e con&s;iderations, drawn from the in&s;tructions to the mini&s;ters of France in this country and their conduct here, from the plain and direct tendency of the mea&s;ures which &s;he wi&s;hed us to adopt, from the nature of her plans in Europe, and from her recent conduct towards the neighouring pow|ers, e&s;tabli&s;h in the mo&s;t incontrovertable manner the opinion, that her object always has been to draw us into the war. This point is &s;till further confirmed by another event. It has been propo&s;ed thro' the Dutch, to our mini&s;ter at Holland, as appears by his letter of
<PB N="92" REF="032226_0093_0FF19AED110A3A78">Nov. 4th 1796, that we &s;hould make <HI>common cau&s;e</HI> with France and Holland again&s;t England, in order to compel her to relinqui&s;h the right of taking her ene|mies goods on board of neutral &s;hips, and <Q>to re&s;tore peace to the two Hemi&s;pheres.</Q></P>
<P>This leads us to enquire what are the motives of her pre&s;ent conduct; and gives us al&s;o the clue whereby they may be di&s;covered.</P>
<P>It is impo&s;&s;ible to &s;uppo&s;e that the mea&s;ures lately adopted by France can mean no more than retaliation for the injuries which &s;he pretends to have received. Admitting tho&s;e injuries to have taken place, and many of them &s;he knows never did take place, admitting all her preten&s;ions to be well founded, and many of them &s;he knows not to be well founded, &s;till tho&s;e injuries and preten&s;ions could never have authorized her pre&s;ent proceedings. The detention of a few privateers, and the re&s;toration of a few prizes by our courts, even if illegal as &s;he pretends; the privileges &s;aid to be ceded to Britain, even had they been ceded; the prohibition to arm ve&s;&s;els and &s;ell prizes in our ports, had &s;he po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed a right to do &s;o; the &s;uffering a few Briti&s;h &s;hips of war to violate our neutrality, even had we &s;uffered it; more e&s;pecially con&s;idering that all the&s;e pretended in|juries were much more than counter-ballanced by real ones from her; could never have occa&s;ioned, much le&s;s authorized, the univer&s;al capture and condemnation of our property, the impri&s;onment, and in many ca&s;es which may occur, the death of our citizens, and the ex|pul&s;ion from her territory of a mini&s;ter &s;ent to conciliate. Some other cau&s;e mu&s;t be &s;ought for aggre&s;&s;ions &s;uch as the&s;e.</P>
<P>Still le&s;s can it be believed that mere anger and vexa|tion at the di&s;appointment of her views, could have giv|en ri&s;e to them. They may, and no doubt, have been much aggravated by this cau&s;e, but it could not have produced them.</P>
<P>Nor can it in my opinion, be &s;uppo&s;ed that a de&s;ign to drive us into a &s;erious quarrel with her, can have given birth to the&s;e mea&s;ures. She too well knows the con&s;equences of &s;uch a quarrel to her&s;elf, and its nece&s;|&s;ary
<PB N="93" REF="032226_0094_0FF19AEEC43AB7C8">effect in counteracting her mo&s;t favourite &s;cheme, to force it upon us. Her mo&s;t favourite &s;cheme is to undermine the naval power of England, by de&s;troying the commerce whereby it is nouri&s;hed and &s;upported. Hence her requi&s;itions to Denmark and the Han&s;e Towns; hence the precipitation wherewith &s;he forced Holland and Spain into the war again&s;t England; hence her threats to Portugal; hence the violence wherewith in contempt of every right and every engagement &s;he &s;eized Leghorn, a neutral port, in which England car|ried on an exten&s;ive trade; hence her oppre&s;&s;ions at Genoa; and hence too her unwearied efforts to work up the di&s;contents between us and Britain into an open rupture. The direct and even the avowed object of all the&s;e mea&s;ures has been to &s;ap the very foundations of the Engli&s;h power, by excluding its commerce from every port. But France well knows that a quarrel be|tween her and this country would of nece&s;&s;ity bring us nearer to England. She knows that having then a common intere&s;t with England again&s;t her, this com|mon intere&s;t would beget an union of means, and a co|operation of mea&s;ures. She knows that our commerce armed for its own defence would float &s;afely into the ports of England, under convoy of the Briti&s;h flag. She knows that Britain would gain our ports as &s;tations for her &s;hips, would be permitted to recruit her marine among our &s;eamen, and to draw &s;upplies of all &s;orts from our country, while &s;he her&s;elf would be excluded from all the&s;e advantages. She knows that as a con&s;equence of the&s;e united mea&s;ures, her colonies and tho&s;e of Spain and Holland, which &s;he ju&s;tly con&s;iders as her own, would be in&s;tantly deprived of all &s;upplies, and mu&s;t &s;ink under the arms of the two countries. She knows that the American market, already &s;o great, and increa|&s;ing with a rapidity &s;o incalculable, mu&s;t in that ca&s;e be &s;ecured almo&s;t exclu&s;ively to England, and wholly &s;hut to her&s;elf and her a&s;&s;ociates. She knows that by a war with her we &s;hould be compelled to call forth our re&s;ources for the formation of a marine, which would place us in a &s;ituation to be &s;till le&s;s in fear of her power or in need of her a&s;&s;i&s;tance. She knows, in &s;ine, that a
<PB N="94" REF="032226_0095_0FF19AF05EC8B4F0">war again&s;t her, in which we mu&s;t co-operate with En|gland, would have a powerful tendency to re&s;tore that union of intere&s;ts, of means, and of good will between the two countries, which for half a century pa&s;t has been the object of her jealou&s;y and dread, and which &s;he has undertaken two wars to break. Her policy, as profound as it is attrocious, will not be confined to the pre&s;ent time only, but looks forward to the period, not a remote one, when the United States mu&s;t, in the ne|ce&s;&s;ary cour&s;e of nature, become the mo&s;t numerous, the mo&s;t opulent and the mo&s;t powerful nation on earth.</P>
<P>I cannot therefore be per&s;uaded, that France intends to quarrel &s;eriou&s;ly with this country. To think &s;o I mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e that her coun&s;els are guided by pa&s;&s;ion and not policy, of which I have perceived no appear|ance. I have ob&s;erved much wickedne&s;s in her plans, but no folly. I have ob&s;erved a determination in her to oppre&s;s where &s;he thought it advantageous, and to deceive where &s;he could not oppre&s;s; to drive or &s;e|duce every nation into her mea&s;ures, in order to cru&s;h by their a&s;&s;i&s;tance tho&s;e who&s;e power &s;he dreaded, and and on who&s;e vigilance &s;he could not impo&s;e; in fine, to &s;acrifice without remor&s;e to her ambition, all tho&s;e whom &s;he found weak enough to became her in&s;tru|ments under the name of allies: but I have not ob|&s;erved a neglect of the means whereby her &s;chemes were to be promoted, much le&s;s a &s;y&s;tem of mea&s;ures calculated to defeat them; and I firmly believe, that nothing could &s;o obviou&s;ly and &s;trongly tend to defeat her &s;chemes again&s;t England as that clo&s;e union of mea&s;ures and intere&s;ts between the two countries, which a quarrel between us and her&s;elf mu&s;t produce.</P>
<P>The very anxiety which &s;he has di&s;covered to place the va&s;t weight of this country in her own &s;cale, is a &s;ecurity that &s;he does not intend to throw it into the &s;cale of her adver&s;ary.</P>
<P>Her mea&s;ures therefore, I believe, have a different and indeed an oppo&s;ite object. Having failed to &s;e|duce, &s;he now is attempting to drive us into her &s;chemes. The means which &s;he employs for effecting this pur|po&s;e,
<PB N="95" REF="032226_0096_0FF19AF606B58398">though mo&s;t unju&s;t and attrocious, are wi&s;e ac|cording to the information on which &s;he acts. By this information &s;he has been wholly deceived: we know that &s;he has been deceived, in what manner and to what extent, and this knowledge gives us the true key to her pre&s;ent conduct.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place &s;he has been deceived by the mea|&s;ures of our government. She has &s;een in them a moderation and forbearance, a de&s;ire of peace, and a patience under her numberle&s;s acts of in&s;ult and in|jury, which &s;he has con&s;trued into a mean, &s;piritle&s;s, and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive di&s;po&s;ition. Having no idea her&s;elf of ju&s;tice, good faith, or moderation, &s;he cannot conceive of them in others; and the acts which they produce, &s;he attributes to avarice, weakne&s;s, or fear.</P>
<P>To the &s;ame motives has &s;he imputed the &s;pirit of peace and conciliation which our government has di&s;|played towards England.</P>
<P>She has been deceived by the conduct of that party in our government, whereby the mea&s;ures of which &s;he complains, have been oppo&s;ed. Ob&s;erving that this party had always expre&s;&s;ed very warm good will to her, and a &s;trong attachment to her cau&s;e, and had advocat|ed a &s;y&s;tem of mea&s;ures much more conformable to her views, than that which was finally adopted, &s;he took up an opinion that they were actuated, not by a de&s;ire to promote what they believed to be the good of their own country, but by a blind devotion to her intere&s;ts. She believed, and &s;till does believe, this to be a French party, ready to go all lengths in a&s;&s;i&s;ting her projects, and &s;ufficiently powerful, if not to direct the govern|ment according to her will, at lea&s;t to prevent it from taking effective mea&s;ures again&s;t her. It mu&s;t be con|fe&s;&s;ed, and a painful confe&s;&s;ion it is, that there are &s;ome individuals who&s;e conduct has given too much rea&s;on for this opinion; but it is al&s;o mo&s;t certain that France has fallen into an utter mi&s;take about the views and principles of this de&s;cription of our fellow citizens in general. They, like the re&s;t, advocated certain mea|&s;ures not becau&s;e they were thought de&s;ireable to any foreign power, but from a belief that they were calculat|ed
<PB N="96" REF="032226_0097_0FF19AF91A2DD010">to promote the good of this country: and France &s;hould &s;he pu&s;h her experiment, will find that howev|er the Americans may differ in opinion about the be&s;t method of conducting their own affairs, there will be but one mind and one &s;pirit among them on the que&s;tion of repelling foreign aggre&s;&s;ion and foreign interference.</P>
<P>France has al&s;o been deceived by the conduct of the people in this country. At the commencement of her revolution &s;he &s;aw them every where di&s;play the &s;trong|e&s;t proofs of attachment to her cau&s;e, and good wi&s;hes for her &s;ucce&s;s. She &s;aw her mini&s;ter, on his arrival in the country, received with the warme&s;t cordiality. She heard the whole American people exultingly hail the birth of a new republic, in a nation which they fondly called their ally and friend, and to which they were proud to acknowledge their obligations and their grati|tude. Far from a&s;cribing the&s;e generous effu&s;ions to their true &s;ource, &s;he regarded them as proofs of a blind and &s;lavi&s;h attachment to her intere&s;ts; and when &s;he &s;aw the government repel her attempts, and &s;teadily re|fu&s;e to come into her mea&s;ures, &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed that it acted in oppo&s;ition to the wi&s;hes of the people, by whom in ea&s;e of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;truggle, it would not be &s;upported.</P>
<P>She has ob&s;erved al&s;o a &s;trong and univer&s;al re&s;ent|ment, excited throughout this country, by the aggre&s;&s;ions of England; and this &s;he con&s;trued into a deadly and la&s;ting hatred to the Briti&s;h nation, which would at all times incline the people to war with it, and render any co-operation or union of mea&s;ures between the two countries, difficult if not impo&s;&s;ible,</P>
<P>In the&s;e two points, &s;he mi&s;takes as widely as in the former. We were delighted with the French revolu|tion, becau&s;e we thought that it would be&s;tow liberty and happine&s;s on a great people. We felt affection to France becau&s;e we con&s;idered her as our ally and our friend. We felt grateful for her a&s;&s;i&s;tance, becau&s;e it had been highly u&s;eful to us. But when the&s;e &s;ervices are made the pretence for the mo&s;t inadmi&s;&s;ible demands, when, in&s;tead of an ally and a friend, we find her a proud and unju&s;t a&s;&s;ailant, we &s;eel a re&s;entment pro|portioned to the injury, and &s;trengthened by the re|flection,
<PB N="97" REF="032226_0098_0FF19AFACCFED010">that this injury comes from a quarter, where we had given friend&s;hip and expected to receive it.</P>
<P>So, with re&s;pect to England, when her injuries cea&s;ed and an honourable reparation was agreed to, we thought our re&s;entment ought al&s;o to cea&s;e.</P>
<P>In the&s;e mi&s;takes there can be no doubt that France has been greatly fortified by her emi&s;&s;aries in this coun|try, and by &s;ome of our citizens both here and in Eu|rope. They have confirmed her in the idea, to adopt the expre&s;&s;ion of general Pinckney, in his letter of Dec. 20th, 1796, <Q>that our government acts upon princi|ples oppo&s;ed to the &s;entiments of a large majority of our people; that we are a people divided by party, the mere creatures of foreign influence, and regard|le&s;s of our national character, honour and intere&s;t.</Q></P>
<P>Believing therefore, that the government, torn by party, is too feeble to re&s;i&s;t her: that thwarted in its operations by the affections, the &s;entiments, and the wi&s;hes of the people, it will be unable to oppo&s;e any effectual exertions again&s;t her attacks; that a powerful party in the government, and a great majority of the people, will take part with her again&s;t the government it&s;elf, or at lea&s;t will withhold from it all effectual &s;upport; that the people, wholly immer&s;ed in the pur|&s;uits of gain, have lo&s;t that martial &s;pirit whereby they were di&s;tingui&s;hed in the late war, and will &s;ubmit to any indignities or injuries, rather than ri&s;k their per&s;ons and wealth in a conte&s;t; &s;he has come to a re&s;olution to attack and pillage us, to mal-treat us in every man|ner, and to refu&s;e all intercour&s;e with us, in the firm per&s;ua&s;ion that the government, however unwillingly, will be obliged to yield, and that we &s;hall &s;ubmit to her terms, as the price of her forbearance.</P>
<P>The&s;e terms, in &s;ub&s;tance and nece&s;&s;ary effect, are a rupture with Britain and the exclu&s;ion of her com|merce from our ports; and &s;uch a con&s;truction of the treaty with France, as &s;hall permit her to arm ve&s;&s;els, inli&s;t crews, and &s;ell prizes in our country, free from the interference of our courts of ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>Should &s;he even fail in this, &s;till &s;he has no doubt that we, from our de&s;ire of peace, will always be ready to
<PB N="98" REF="032226_0099_0FF2E173E34747D0">make an accomodation, and to relinqui&s;h our claim to in|demnity as the price of deliverance from further aggre&s;&s;ion. In the mean time &s;he will accompli&s;h, &s;he thinks, two very important objects; &s;he will wound the commerce of England thro' our &s;ides; and by plundering us, &s;he will not only acquire &s;ome aid to her trea&s;ury, but al&s;o give employment and &s;upport to great numbers of her people. A third object and of no &s;mall importance, will be the de&s;truction, in part, of our re&s;ources; where|by we &s;hould be rendered more dependant on her as al|lies, and le&s;s formidable as enemies.</P>
<P>Such in my opinion, my fellow citizens, are the ob|jects of France in her pre&s;ent mea&s;ures towards this country; and I am firmly per&s;uaded that the only me|thod of inducing her to abandom tho&s;e mea&s;ures, is to convince her by our conduct that they will not be effec|tual: to convince her by firm united and vigorous mea|&s;ures, that her opinions re&s;pecting us are erroneous; and that we are determined, at all hazards and under any po&s;&s;ible &s;acrifice, to maintain our rights, repell unju&s;t attacks, and &s;eek reparation for injuries wantonly com|mitted: that we are not a feeble, pu&s;illanimous or divided people, oppo&s;ed to our own government, and ready to acquie&s;ce in or aid the interference of foreigners in our affairs. We ought to &s;hew them at the &s;ame time, that while we are re&s;olved to repel injury, we are willing to make every rea&s;onable advance towards a ju&s;t accomo|dation: that while we prepare firmly and vigorou&s;ly for war, we are de&s;irous of cultivating peace, as long as any hope of pre&s;erving it remains: that altho' we mean to appeal firmly to the &s;word if driven to that extremity, we &s;hall make the appeal with reluctance and regret.</P>
<P>This is the &s;y&s;tem recommended by the Pre&s;ident in his &s;peech to both Hou&s;es at the opening of Congre&s;s. He declares his re&s;olution to make another attempt to negociate and recommends that this attempt &s;hould be fortified and &s;econded by &s;erious preparations at home. This will give weight to our complaints, and &s;hould re|dre&s;s be refu&s;ed, will place us in a &s;ituation to meet the unfavorable event with energy and &s;ucce&s;s. I perfectly concur in the&s;e &s;entiments and &s;hall give my voice for
<PB N="99" REF="032226_0100_0FF2DF46A0770CE8">&s;upporting them in the Hou&s;e in the mo&s;t efficacious manner. The &s;ubject is now under di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, and I have rea&s;on to believe, that the &s;y&s;tem recommended by the Pre&s;ident will be adopted.</P>
<P>This &s;y&s;tem is exactly conformable to that which was formerly adopted re&s;pecting Britain. When Bri|tain, after repeated remon&s;trances on our part, continu|ed her depredations on our commerce, though in &s;o do|ing &s;he broke no treaty, though &s;he did not recal her mini&s;ter or drive away ours, we re&s;olved to prepare for re&s;i&s;tance, but in the meantime to make another attempt by negociation; and fortunately the attempt was &s;uc|ce&s;sful. Britain gave up her mea&s;ures, and agreed to make re&s;titution for the pa&s;t. Should France be induc|ed to act in the &s;ame manner, we &s;hall once more have the &s;atisfaction of &s;eeing our rights vindicated by that union of moderation and firmne&s;s which has heretofore redounded &s;o much to the honour and advantage of our country. Should &s;he refu&s;e and war prove nece&s;&s;ary, the recollection that we have done all in our power to avoid it, will enable us to &s;upport the &s;truggle with una|nimity and fortitude.</P>
<P>Should the &s;y&s;tem recommended by the Pre&s;ident be adopted, it is impo&s;&s;ible to fore&s;ee what particular mea|&s;ures of preparation will be preferred. As to the per&s;on to be &s;ent to France, there can be no doubt that it will be general Pinckney. The firmne&s;s, good &s;en&s;e, and moderation which he di&s;played while in Paris, reflect honour on him&s;elf and the country, and have received univer&s;al approbation here. It is agreed by all parties, that our honour and intere&s;ts can be no where &s;afer than in his hands.</P>
<P>Such, my fellow citizens, is the &s;y&s;tem of mea&s;ures towards France, which in my opinion, ought to be adopted. I am per&s;uaded that they intend not to make war upon us, but to &s;courge and frighten us into &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion: and that the only po&s;&s;ible method of making them de&s;i&s;t from the attempt, is to convince them, not merely by declarations, but by effectual preparations for war, that we are not frightened, and will not &s;ubmit to be
<PB N="100" REF="032226_0101_0FF2DF48987BA788">&s;courged. When they under&s;tand this, I am fully per|&s;uaded that they will abandon their project. Our ne|gociation I believe will be &s;ucce&s;sful, but the foundati|ons of its &s;ucce&s;s mu&s;t be laid in the Hou&s;e of Repre|&s;entatives; and tho&s;e foundations mu&s;t be vigorous and effectual preparations for war. We mu&s;t confider our|&s;elves as in the pre&s;ence of a bully, who can be prevent|ed from &s;triking us in no manner but by &s;hewing him that we are able and re&s;olved to return the blow.</P>
<P>Should I however mi&s;take in all this, &s;till the &s;ame &s;y&s;tem will be right. Should the views of France be different from what I have &s;uppo&s;ed; &s;hould the plan of French aggrandizement, to borrow the words of an eloquent &s;peaker in the hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives, require America to be driven into the war, war we &s;hall have, in &s;pite of all our peaceable endeavours to avert it: and in that ca&s;e, the &s;ooner we &s;et about &s;erious preparati|ons, the better we &s;hall be able to repel and retort the attack.</P>
<P>Thus in either ca&s;e, our cour&s;e mu&s;t be the &s;ame. Whether France intends to make war upon us, to bully us, or under pretence of "ju&s;t di&s;plea&s;ure" to continue her depredations on us for the purpo&s;e of injuring Eng|land, as long as we will &s;ubmit to them, &s;till our wi&s;|dom lies in &s;peedy and effectual preparation.</P>
<P>Should any a&s;k, what are the &s;acrifices we mu&s;t in|cur by a war, and what are our means of becoming formidable to France? I would an&s;wer that as to &s;a|crifices the greate&s;t we can make is that of our rights and our independence; that war is an evil always to be avoided, but infinitely le&s;s than national degradation, and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the will of a foreign power; that every po&s;&s;ible lo&s;s of property and lives may be repaired by time and indu&s;try, if we pre&s;erve our honor and our government, but that the&s;e, once lo&s;t, can never be re&s;|tored; in fine that a nation which weighs its pur&s;e again&s;t its rights, never fails in the end to lo&s;e both one and the other.</P>
<P>To &s;hew that we will &s;ubmit to injuries, for fear of lo&s;s, amounts to bribing foreign nations with our own money, to in&s;ult and attack us.</P>

I would an&s;wer that we magnanimou&s;ly re&s;olved to re&s;i&s;t the power of Britain more than twenty years ago, when our re&s;ources were infinitely le&s;s than at pre&s;ent, and our &s;ituation for employing them far more di&s;ad|vantageous, and that this re&s;olution created the means of re&s;i&s;tance. I would an&s;wer that we po&s;&s;e&s;s a popu|lation probably little &s;hort of &s;ix millions; a country abounding with every thing nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;ub&s;i&s;tance and arming of troops; more &s;hips and &s;ailors than any nation on earth except England; an exten&s;ive revenue not felt by the people, and capable of very great increa&s;e without oppre&s;&s;ion; an union among our|&s;elves, cemented by habit, mutual intere&s;t, and affec|tion; a martial &s;pirit and enterprize, which &s;o gloriou&s;ly di&s;played it&s;elf in the war for our independence; expe|rienced officers formed in that war, and &s;till ready to bleed for their country; a wi&s;e government po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing our confidence, and capable of uniting and directing our exertions; in a word, that &s;teady per&s;evering cou|rage, that lofty unconquerable &s;pirit of independence, wherein the true &s;trength of nations con&s;i&s;ts, more than in population, in wealth, in fleets, in armies, or in gene|rals; and which, wherever it exi&s;ts, finds all other means or makes them.</P>
<P>I would an&s;wer that we &s;till po&s;&s;e&s;s WASHINGTON, the Hero and Patriot, who conducted us with &s;o much glory thro' our former &s;truggle, and who&s;e martial figure, which age has rendered more venerable with|out impairing its &s;trength, would again be &s;een at the head of our armies,</P>
<P>I would an&s;wer that with not half our numbers, few of our other advantages, and in a &s;ituation far more contiguous and more expo&s;ed, the Swi&s;s have coura|geou&s;ly and &s;ucce&s;sfully maintained their rights, and pre&s;erved their tranquility, by tho&s;e mea&s;ures which we now recommend, by proving to all parties: that though de&s;irous of peace they were prepared for war; were prepared to place their hou&s;es, their families, and the bones of their fathers, under the protection of their &s;words, and to &s;take the la&s;t drop of their blood on the &s;ucce&s;s of the conte&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="032226_0103_0FF2DF5337FAC3C8">
I would an&s;wer that if driven into a war we can buy at a price cheap to our&s;elves, the full co-operation of the Briti&s;h navy: that our numerous merchant &s;hips can &s;peedily be converted into &s;hips of war: that by with|holding &s;upplies from France and her allies in the We&s;t Indies, we can mo&s;t effectually aid the operations of her enemies: tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Britain being thus enabled to call home a great part of her pre&s;ent force in the We&s;t Indies, will encrea&s;e &s;till more her internal &s;afety, and the &s;uperiority of her navy in Europe: and that New Orlea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> and the Floridas mu&s;t fall into our hands, whereby we &s;hall &s;ecure the navigation of the Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ippi, free our|&s;elves from a trouble&s;ome neighbour, and obtain com|pleat controul over the &s;outhern Indians.</P>
<P>I would an&s;wer in &s;ine, in the words of a celebrated writer, that where courage is not wanting, all other means will be found or created.</P>
<P>I might conclude this long addre&s;s my fellow citizens, by an exhortation to &s;ummon up your fortitude, and prepare bravely to meet the attacks which may be made on our country. The &s;ubject &s;upplies ample materials for an appeal to all the feelings which di&s;tingui&s;h the Patriot and the Hero. But I know it is not nec&s;&s;ary. The men who fought at King's-Mountain and the Cow|pens, do not need an exhortation, to bleed for their country &s;hould &s;he be forced to call for their a&s;&s;i&s;tance: and I know that, in ca&s;e of that awful event which we &s;o anxiou&s;ly de&s;ire to avert, America will again &s;ind the &s;ons of ninety &s;ix di&s;trict among the brave&s;t of her defend|ers.</P>
