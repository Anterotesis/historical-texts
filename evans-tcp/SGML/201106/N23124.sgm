<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>AT a time when the thir&s;t for knowledge is &s;o univer&s;al, that it is &s;ought after by all ranks of people; through its mo&s;t intricate windings, and mazy labyrinths, it is not to be wondered at, that books of &s;cience and polite literature are publi&s;hed in &s;uch abund|ance, and that they meet with that reception and en|couragement, from a liberal minded public, which their noble de&s;ign requires, and which their intrin&s;ic merit demands.</P>
<P>The de&s;ign of this publication, is not merely to amu&s;e; but rather, in an engaging, diver&s;ified and plea&s;ing manner, to attract the attention&mdash;imperceptibly gain the affections&mdash;and draw the &s;oul to a love of virtue, (by delineating her in her mo&s;t attractive and alluring dre&s;s) from whence ari&s;es the &s;pring of all great, noble and generous actions:&mdash;To inculcate a &s;incere dete&s;ta|tion of every &s;pecies of vice, by an expo&s;ition of the malevolent affections of the mind, as well in their &s;ofter, as in their more glaring, or aggravated colours.</P>
<P>The above, though not the lea&s;t, is not the chief inten|tion of this &s;election.&mdash;The art of thinking ju&s;tly, &s;peak|ing pertinently and writing with correctne&s;s, ea&s;e, ele|gance and preci&s;ion upon any &s;ubject, has ever been e&s;|teemed the fir&s;t ornament of the human mind, and ju&s;t|ly accounted the grand characteri&s;tical mark, by which the rational being is di&s;tingui&s;hed from the irrational.&mdash;
<PB N="iv" REF="030567_0004_0FE7D4C133154D10">
Yet, how few do we find thus accompli&s;hed, or how very few give them&s;elves any trouble to hold their rank in the great &s;cale of animal creation? To render the above in|valuable accompli&s;hment ea&s;y of acquirement, is the prin|cipal de&s;ign of <HI>THE HIVE,</HI> wherein all the vices, vir|tues, relative duties and affections of the human &s;oul are delineated by the ma&s;terly hands of many of the fir&s;t writers in the Engli&s;h language, who are as much e&s;|teemed for their correctne&s;s, ea&s;e, elegance and beauty of diction, as for their conci&s;ene&s;s, per&s;picuity, ju&s;tne&s;s and dignity of thought.</P>
<P>The editor of this mi&s;cellaneous volume, deeply im|pre&s;&s;ed with the importance of the above con&s;ideration, without any parade of unmeaning ceremony, humbly recommends <HI>THE HIVE</HI> to the &s;upport and attention of the candid <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word">, as a publication &s;olely intended to improve the heart, to inform the judgment, and gently to draw the affections to the love of virtue.</P>

<HEAD>AFFLICTIONS. THE PRESENT MISFORTUNE IS ALWAYS DEEMED THE GREATEST: THEREFORE, SMALL CAUSES ARE SUFFICIENT TO MAKE US UNEA|SY, WHEN GREAT ONES ARE NOT IN THE WAY.</HEAD>
<P>WE ought to make a good improvement of pa&s;t and pre&s;ent afflictions. If they are not &s;anctified to us, they become a double cro&s;s; but if they work rightly in us, and, convince us of our failings, and how ju&s;tly we are afflicted, they do us much good. Affliction is a &s;piritual phy&s;ic for the &s;oul, and is compared to a furnace; for as gold is tried and purified therein, &s;o men are prov|ed, and either purified from their dro&s;s, and fitted for good u&s;es, or el&s;e entirely burnt up and undone forever. Therefore may all
<PB N="6" REF="030567_0006_0FE7D4C2C029ABF8">
who labour under any kind of affliction, have rea&s;on to &s;ay with JOB&mdash;"when he hath tried me, I &s;hall come forth as pure gold."</P>
<P>LET a man live (&s;ays Mr. Steele) but two or three years without affliction, and he is al|mo&s;t good for nothing, he cannot pray, nor meditate, nor keep his heart fixed upon &s;pirit|ual things; but let God &s;mite him in his child, health, or e&s;tate; now he can find his tongue and affections again, now he awakes and falls to his duty in earne&s;t; now God has twice as much honour for him as he had before. Now, &s;aith God, this amendment plea&s;eth me, this rod was well be&s;towed, I have di&s;|appointed him in his great benefit and advan|tage.</P>
<P>IT may be boldly affirmed, that good men generally reap more &s;ub&s;tantial benefit from their afflictions, than bad men do from their pro&s;perities; and what they lo&s;e in wealth, plea&s;ure, or honor, they gain with va&s;t advantage in wi&s;dom, goodne&s;s and tranquillity of mind.</P>
<P>PROSPERITY is not without its troubles, nor adver&s;ity without its comforts. A mind that can bear affliction without murmur, and the weight of a plentiful fortune without vain glory&mdash;that can be familiar without mean|ne&s;s, and re&s;erved without pride, has &s;ome|thing in it great, particularly plea&s;ing, and truly admirable.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="030567_0007_0FE7D46B19371018">NOTHING would be more unhappy, (&s;aid Demetrius) than a man who had never known affliction. The be&s;t need afflictions for the trial of their virtue: How can we ex|erci&s;e the grace of contentment, if all things &s;ucceed well? or, that of forgivene&s;s if we have no enemies?</P>
<P>HE who barely weeps at misfortunes, when it is in his power to heal them, is not touch|ed with them to the heart, and only &s;heds the tears of a crocodile.</P>
<P>IF you are di&s;quieted at any thing, you &s;hould con&s;ider with your&s;elf, Is this thing of that worth, that for it I &s;hould &s;o di&s;turb my&s;elf, and lo&s;e my peace and tranquillity?</P>
<P>THE con&s;ideration of a greater evil, is a &s;ort of remedy again&s;t a le&s;&s;er. THEY are always impaired by affliction, who are not improved by it. A virtuous man is more peaceable in adver&s;ity, than a wicked man in pro&s;perity.</P>
<P>THE keeping of our&s;elves above grief, and every painful pa&s;&s;ion, is indeed very beauti|ful and excellent; and none but &s;ouls of the fir&s;t rate &s;eem to be qualified for the under|taking.</P>
<P>IT were no virtue to bear calamities, if we did not feel them.</P>
<P>DIVINE PROVIDENCE always places the remedy near the evil; there is not any duty to which Providence has not annexed a ble&s;&s;|ing;
<PB N="8" REF="030567_0008_0FE7D4C87A7F72D8">
nor any affliction for which virtue has not provided a remedy.</P>
<P>IF &s;ome are refined like gold in the fur|nace of affliction, there are many more, that, like chaff, are con&s;umed in it.</P>
<P>SORROW, when it is exce&s;&s;ive, takes away fervour from piety, vigour from action, health from the body, light from the rea&s;on, and repo&s;e from the con&s;cience. Re&s;ignation to the divine will is a noble and needful le&s;&s;on.</P>
<P>YET there is a gloomy plea&s;ure in being dejected and incon&s;olable. Melancholy &s;tu|dies how to improve it&s;elf, and &s;orrow finds wonderful relief in being more &s;orrowful.</P>
<P>TO be afflicted with the afflicted, is an in&s;tance of humanity, and the demand of good nature and good breeding: Pity is but an imaginary aid; and yet, were it not for that, &s;orrow would be many times utterly in&s;upportable.</P>
<P>MIRTH is by no means a remedy for grief; on the contrary, it rai&s;es and inflames it. The only probable way I know of, to &s;often or cure grief in others, is by putting on an appearance of feeling it your&s;elf; and you mu&s;t, be&s;ides, talk frequently and feelingly on the occa&s;ion, and prai&s;e and blame as the &s;ufferer does; but then remember to make u&s;e of the opportunity this conde&s;cen&s;ion and familiarity gives you, of leading him, by de|grees, into things and pa&s;&s;ages remote from his pre&s;ent bent of mind, and not unplea&s;ing
<PB N="9" REF="030567_0009_0FE7D46FB10F5B50">
in them&s;elves. In this manner, and by this policy, you will be able to &s;teal him away from his afflictions with his own approba|tion, and teach him to think and &s;peak of other things than that alone, which frets &mdash; or rather WRINGS his heart.</P>
<P>NONE &s;hould de&s;pair, becau&s;e God can help them, and none &s;hould pre&s;ume, becau&s;e God can cro&s;s them. A firm tru&s;t in the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of an Almighty Being naturally produces patience, hope, chearfulne&s;s and all other di&s;po&s;itions of mind, that alleviate tho&s;e calamities which we are not able to re|move.</P>
<P>HE, who is puffed up with the fir&s;t gale of pro&s;perity, will bend beneath the fir&s;t bla&s;t of adver&s;ity.</P>
<P>REPROOF in adver&s;ity hath a double &s;ting.</P>
<P>THERE is but one way of fortifying the &s;oul again&s;t all gloomy pre&s;ages and terrors of the mind; and that is, by &s;ecuring to our|&s;elves the friend&s;hip and protection of that Being who di&s;po&s;es of events, and governs futurity.</P>
<P>EVENTS which have the appearance of misfortunes, often prove a happy &s;ource of future felicity; this con&s;ideration &s;hould en|able us to &s;upport affliction with calmne&s;s and fortitude.</P>

<HEAD>ANGER.</HEAD>
<P>AN angry man who &s;up|pre&s;&s;es his pa&s;&s;ions, thinks wor&s;e than he &s;peaks, and an angry man that will chide, &s;peaks wor&s;e than he thinks. A vindictive temper is not only unea&s;y to others, but to them that have it.</P>
<P>ANGER may glance into the bo&s;om of a wi&s;e man, but re&s;ts only in the bo&s;om of fools.</P>
<P>IN all things mi&s;takes are excu&s;able; but an error that proceeds from any good prin|ciple leaves no room for re&s;entment.</P>
<P>IT was a good method ob&s;erved by Soc|rates, when he found in him&s;elf any di&s;po|&s;ition to anger, he would check it by &s;peak|ing low, in oppo&s;ition to the motions of his di&s;plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>IT is much better to reprove ingenuou&s;ly, than to be angry &s;ecretly.</P>
<P>HE that waits for an opportunity of acting his revenge, watches to do him&s;elf a mi&s;|chief.</P>
<P>BY taking revenge, a man is but even with his enemy, but by pa&s;&s;ing it over, he is &s;u|perior.</P>
<P>IT is the only valour to remit a wrong, and the greate&s;t applau&s;e that I might hurt and would not.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="030567_0011_0FE7D472696AD820">TO be able to bear provocation, is an ar|gument of great wi&s;dom; and to forgive it, of a great mind.</P>
<P>THEY who will be angry for any thing, will be angry for nothing.</P>
<P>NONE &s;hould be &s;o implacable as to refu&s;e a humble &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. He, who&s;e very be&s;t actions mu&s;t be &s;een with favourable allow|ance, cannot be too mild, moderate and for|giving.</P>
<P>TO pardon faults of error, is but ju&s;tice to the failings of our nature.</P>
<P>THE noble&s;t remedy for injuries is obliv|ion. Light injuries are made none by not regarding them.</P>
<P>THERE is no man obliged to live &s;o free from pa&s;&s;ion, as not in &s;ome ca&s;es to &s;how &s;ome re&s;entment: There are injuries, affronts, &amp;c. that are frequently met with in our tour through life, where it would be rather a &s;toical &s;tupidity than virtue, to do otherwi&s;e: I do not mean revenge, for that mu&s;t ever be wrong, but a proper re&s;entment, &s;o that the injurer may not be encouraged to commit a &s;econd injury.</P>
<P>ONE unquiet di&s;po&s;ition di&s;tempers the peace and unity of a whole family, or &s;ociety; as one jarring in&s;trument will &s;poil a whole concert.</P>
<P>OUR pa&s;&s;ions are like the &s;eas, agitated by the winds; but as God hath &s;et bounds to

the&s;e, &s;o &s;hould we to tho&s;e? &s;o far &s;hould they go, and no farther.</P>
<P>REASON is given us, by him who breathed in us our immortal part, that in all our ac|tions we &s;hould govern our&s;elves by advice of it.</P>
<P>WE mu&s;t forget the good we do, for fear of upbraiding, and religion bids us forget injuries, le&s;t the remembrance of them &s;ug|ge&s;t to us a de&s;ire of revenge.</P>
<P>HE that is always angry with his &s;in, &s;hall &s;eldom &s;in in his anger.</P>
<P>HE that is not above an injury, is below him&s;elf.</P>
<P>ANGER let loo&s;e is one of the mo&s;t fooli&s;h pa&s;&s;ions, 'tis no wonder that it generally di&s;|appoints it&s;elf, and mi&s;&s;es its end, by chu&s;|ing the mo&s;t violent means, which are &s;eldom &s;ucce&s;sful.</P>
<P>REASON, in anger, is like a &s;hip in the tempe&s;t, hurried away by the waves, and often over&s;et.</P>
<P>THE angry man is his own &s;evere&s;t tormen|tor; his brea&s;t knows no peace, while his raging pa&s;&s;ions are re&s;trained by no &s;en&s;e of either moral or religious duties: What would be his ca&s;e, if his unforgiving examples were followed by his all merciful maker, who&s;e forgivene&s;s he can only hope for, in propor|tion as he him&s;elf forgives and loves his fel|low creatures, through the merits and blood of the ble&s;&s;ed Je&s;us.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="030567_0013_0FE7D4782BD76F38">AN injury unan&s;wered, in cour&s;e, grows weary of it&s;elf, and dies away in a voluntary remor&s;e.&mdash;</P>
<P>THINK, when you are enraged at any one, what would probably become your &s;entiments, &s;hould he die during the di&s;pute. Reconcilia|tion is the tendere&s;t part either of friend&s;hip or love.

<HEAD>BEAUTY.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is nothing that gives us &s;o plea&s;ing a pro&s;pect of human na|ture, as the contemplation of wi&s;dom and beauty. Beauty is an overweaning, &s;elfsuffi|cient thing, carele&s;s of providing it&s;elf any more &s;ub&s;tantial ornament; nay, &s;o little does it con&s;ult its own intere&s;t, that it too of|ten defeats it&s;elf by betraying that innocence which renders it lovely and de&s;irable. As therefore virtue makes a beautiful woman ap|pear more beautiful, &s;o beauty makes a vir|tuous woman really more virtuous.</P>
<P>IT is, methinks, a low and degrading idea of that &s;ex, which was created to refine the joys, and &s;often the cares of human nature, by the mo&s;t agreeable participation, to con|&s;ider them merely as objects of &s;ight. This
<PB N="16" REF="030567_0016_0FE7D4D719FC1980">
is abridging them of their natural extent of power, to put them upon a level with their pictures. How much nobler is the contem|plation of beauty heightened by virtue, and commanding our e&s;teem and love, while it draws our ob&s;ervation? How faint and &s;pir|itle&s;s are the charms of the coquet, when compared with the real loveline&s;s of inno|cence, piety, good humour, the irre&s;i&s;table charms of mode&s;ty unaffected, humanity, with all tho&s;e rare and plea&s;ing marks of &s;en|&s;ibility; virtues, which add a new &s;oftne&s;s to her &s;ex; and even beautify her beauty.</P>
<P>NOTHING (&s;ays Mr. Addi&s;on) can atone for the want of mode&s;ty and innocence, with|out which, beauty is ungraceful and quality contemptible.</P>
<P>LET a woman be decked with all the em|belli&s;hments of art and care of nature; yet if boldne&s;s be to be read in her face, it blots all the lines of beauty.</P>
<P>THE plainer the dre&s;s, with greater lu&s;tre does beauty appear: Virtue is the greate&s;t ornament, and good &s;en&s;e the be&s;t equipage.</P>
<P>AN inviolable fidelity, good humour and complacency of temper in a woman, outlive all the charms of a fine face, and make the decays of it invi&s;ible.</P>
<P>IT is but too &s;eldom &s;een, that beautiful per&s;ons are otherwi&s;e of great virtue.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="030567_0017_0FE7D47F75101B40">NO beauty hath any charms equal to the inward beauty of the mind. A gracefulne&s;s in the manners is much more engaging than that of the per&s;on; the former every one has the power to attain to in &s;ome mea&s;ure, the latter is in no one's power&mdash;is no internal worth, and was the gift of God, who formed us all. Meekne&s;s and mode&s;ty are the true and la&s;ting ornaments.</P>

<P>BEAUTY in&s;pires a plea&s;ing &s;entiment, which prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;es people in its favour. Mod|e&s;ty has great advantages, it &s;ets off beauty, and &s;erves as a veil to ugline&s;s. The misfor|tune of ugline&s;s is, that it &s;ometimes &s;mothers and buries much merit; people do not look for the engaging qualities of the head and heart in a forbidding figure. 'Tis no ea&s;y matter when merit mu&s;t make its way, and &s;hine through a di&s;agreeable out&s;ide.</P>
<P>WITHOUT virtue, good &s;en&s;e and &s;weetne&s;s of di&s;po&s;ition, the fine&s;t &s;et of features will, ere long cea&s;e to plea&s;e; but, where the&s;e with the graces are united, it mu&s;t afford an agreeable and plea&s;ing contemplation.</P>

<P>BEAUTY without the graces of the mind, will have no power over the hearts of the wi&s;e and good. Beauty is a flower which &s;oon withers; health changes, and &s;trength abates, but innocency is immortal, and a comfort both in life and death.</P>

<L>Benevolence, that's unconfin'd,</L>
<L>Extends her lib'ral hand to all.</L>

<P>AS benevolence is the mo&s;t &s;ocial of all virtues, &s;o it is of the large&s;t extent; for there is not any man, either &s;o great or &s;o little, but he is yet capable of receiving ben|efits.</P>
<P>THE greate&s;t benefits of all, have no wit|ne&s;s, but lie concealed in the con&s;cience.</P>
<P>A KIND benefactor makes a man happy as &s;oon as he can, and as much as he can. There &s;hould be no delay in a benefit, but the mode&s;ty of the receiver. If we can|not fore&s;ee the reque&s;t, let us however im|mediately grant it. It is &s;o grievous a thing to &s;ay, I beg!&mdash;The very word puts a man out of countenance, and it is a double kind|ne&s;s to do the thing, and &s;ave an hone&s;t heart the confu&s;ion of a blu&s;h.</P>
<P>LET no one be weary of rendering good offices, for by obliging others, (if our hearts
<PB N="20" REF="030567_0020_0FE7D4DE5CD0E460">
and affections are as they &s;hould be) we are really kind to our&s;elves. No man was ev|er a lo&s;er by good works; for though he may not be immediately rewarded, yet, in pro|ce&s;s of time, &s;ome happy emergency or oth|er occurs to convince him, that virtuous men are the darlings of Providence.</P>
<P>HE that receives a benefit without being thankful, robs the giver of his ju&s;t reward. It mu&s;t be a due reciprocation in virtue that can make the obliger and the obliged worthy.</P>
<P>HE who receives a good turn, &s;hould nev|er forget it; he who does one &s;hould never remember it.</P>
<P>IT is the character of an unworthy nature, to write injuries in marble, and benefits in du&s;t.</P>
<P>THE following fact, I think, &s;trongly delin|eates the image of a noble and generous mind, and may ju&s;tly be ranked among the beauties of STERNE&mdash;&s;o de&s;ervedly famed for his humanity, &s;en&s;ibility and genero&s;ity. A friend of this benevolent DIVINE, being di&s;tre&s;&s;ed in finances, and whom Sterne wi&s;h|ed to relieve, (for Sterne could not be happy while a FRIEND was in di&s;tre&s;s) but it was not in his power at that time!&mdash;Yet,&mdash;the FRIEND! a friend mu&s;t be relieved at all haz|ards!&mdash;"A friend is &s;acred!"&mdash;Sterne finds no re&s;t till it is done.&mdash;"I was" (&s;ays he) "obliged to borrow two hundred pounds be|yond my own currency, upon the occa&s;ion.
<PB N="21" REF="030567_0021_0FE7D486B8F7E490">
I had no &s;ufficient &s;ecurity to proffer; but Captain Le Fevre happened luckily ju&s;t then, to have &s;old out of the army&mdash;<HI>I mortgaged the &s;tory to him,</HI> and he lent me the money." The friend and Sterne, were each relieved&mdash; Sterne was the happie&s;t of the two.</P>
<P>LET us be careful that we permit no arti|ficial de&s;ires to prevent us of the power, in which we &s;hall ever find real plea&s;ure&mdash;that of relieving di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P>THAT which is given with pride and o&s;|tentation, is rather an ambition than a boun|ty. Let a benefit be ever &s;o con&s;iderable, the manner of conferring it is yet the noble&s;t part.</P>
<P>IT is a good rule for every one who has a competency of fortune, to lay a&s;ide a certain proportion of his income for pious and char|itable u&s;es; he will then always give ea&s;ily and chearfully.</P>
<P>IT was well &s;aid of him that called a good office that was done har&s;hly, "a &s;tony piece of bread:" It is nece&s;&s;ary for him that is hungry to receive it, but it almo&s;t chokes him in the going down.</P>
<P>ALPHONSO, king of Scicily, being a&s;ked, What he would re&s;erve for him&s;elf, who gave &s;o much away? Even tho&s;e things, &s;aid he, that I do give, for the re&s;t I e&s;teem as nothing.</P>
<P>IT is a much greater kindne&s;s not to &s;uffer us to fall, than to lend a hand to help us up,
<PB N="22" REF="030567_0022_0FE7D4DFE881F308">
and a greater &s;atisfaction to be kindly re|ceived, and obtain nothing, than obtain what we de&s;ire, after having been expo&s;ed.</P>
<P>REQUESTS co&s;t a reluctancy in nature, fearing to receive the di&s;courte&s;y of a denial. That which is be&s;towed too late, is next to not giving.</P>
<P>MONARCHS are more unhappy than their &s;ubjects.&mdash;For u&s;e makes &s;tate familiar, and the fatigue grows every day more irk&s;ome.&mdash; Has opulence and grandeur then no advant|ages? NONE&mdash;but the power of doing good. I have often been &s;urpri&s;ed that &s;o little of this kind of manufacture is ever wrought by princes, when the very rarity of the work might &s;erve to render their names famous to po&s;terity. "And paid a trade&s;man once to make him &s;tare." But away with all ambi|tion, which only affects our names, without improving our natures.</P>
<P>LIBERALITY is never &s;o beautiful or en|gaging, as when the hand is concealed that be&s;tows the gift.</P>
<P>A NOBLE Lord, who once &s;uffered him|&s;elf to lo&s;e a thou&s;and pounds to a man of mode&s;t merit, whom he knew to be greatly nece&s;&s;itated, and to whom he dur&s;t not offer it as a gift, &s;urely did a very laudable action, and in which mode&s;ty had no &s;mall &s;hare.</P>

<HEAD>CONVERSATION.</HEAD>
<P>IT is highly requi&s;ite to avoid too much familiarity in conver&s;ation. It is an old Engli&s;h adage, <HI>"too much famili|arity breeds contempt,"</HI> &s;o he that familiarizes him&s;elf, pre&s;ently lo&s;es his &s;uperiority, that his &s;erious air, and good deportment gave him, and con&s;equently his credit.

We mu&s;t not be too familiar with &s;uperiors, becau&s;e of danger; nor with inferiors by rea|&s;on of indecency; and far le&s;s with mean people, whom ignorance renders in&s;olent; for, being in&s;en&s;ible of the HONOURS done them, they pre&s;ume it is their due.</P>
<P>IN your di&s;cour&s;e be cautious what you &s;peak, and to whom you &s;peak; how you &s;peak, and when you &s;peak; and what you &s;peak, &s;peak wi&s;ely, &s;peak truly. A fool's heart is in his tongue, but a wi&s;e man's tongue is in his heart.</P>
<P>PLUTARCH advi&s;es to moderate and cor|rect all ba&s;e, unworthy and hurtful pa&s;&s;ions, that in all our conver&s;ations we may be open hearted and &s;incere, and not &s;eek to over|reach

<P>NOTHING more engages the affections of men, than a hand&s;ome addre&s;s and grace|ful conver&s;ation.</P>

<P>TALKATIVENESS is u&s;ually called a femi|nine vice, but it is po&s;&s;ible to go into ma&s;cu|line company, where it will be as hard to wedge in a word as at a female go&s;&s;iping.</P>
<P>CONTROVERSIES, for the mo&s;t part, leave truth in the middle, and are factious at both ends.</P>

<P>PLEASURE given in &s;ociety, like money lent to u&s;ury, returns with intere&s;t to tho&s;e who di&s;per&s;e it.</P>
<P>MODESTY &s;hould be di&s;tingui&s;hed from an aukward ba&s;hfulne&s;s, and &s;ilence &s;hould on|ly be enjoined when it would be froward and impertinent to talk; if you &s;peak without conceit or affectation, you will always be more plea&s;ing than tho&s;e who &s;it like &s;tatues without &s;en&s;e or motion.

<P>LET the fruition of things ble&s;s thy po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and think it more &s;atis|faction to live richly, than to die rich; for &s;ince your good works, not your GOODS, will follow you; &s;ince wealth is an appurtenance of life, and no dead man rich, to fami&s;h in plenty and live poorly, to die rich, were but a multiplying in madne&s;s, and u&s;e upon u&s;e in folly.</P>

<P>IT is almo&s;t a wonder that covetou&s;ne&s;s, even in &s;pite of it&s;elf, does not at &s;ome times argue a man into charity, by its own prin|ciple of looking forwards, and the firm ex|pectation it would delight in, of receiving its own again with u&s;ury.</P>

<P>IN order to our final doom and &s;entence, we need but this one enquiry, whether we were charitable or uncharitable? For they who are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with a true divine charity, have all chri&s;tian graces. They who have
<PB N="56" REF="030567_0056_0FE7D51A54319228">
not this divine principle have no good in them, and that is enough to condemn them, without enquiring what evil they have done.</P>
<P>WHEN a compa&s;&s;ionate man falls, who would not pity him: Who that had power to do it, would not befriend and rai&s;e him up? Or could the mo&s;t barbarous temper offer an in&s;ult to his di&s;tre&s;s, without pain and reluctance? True charity is always un|willing to find excu&s;es;&mdash;in generous &s;pir|its, compa&s;&s;ion is &s;ometimes an over balance for &s;elf pre&s;ervation: God certainly inter|wove that friendly &s;oftne&s;s in our nature, to be a check upon too great a propen&s;ity to|wards &s;elf love.</P>
<P>UNDER the go&s;pel, God is plea&s;ed with a living &s;acrifice; but the offerings of the dead, &s;uch as te&s;tamentary charities are, which are intended to have no effect &s;o long as we live, are no better than dead &s;acrifices; and it may be que&s;tioned, whether they will be brought into the account of our lives, if we do no good while we are living. The&s;e death bed charities, are too like a death bed repentance; men &s;eem to give their e&s;tates to God and the poor, ju&s;t as they part with their &s;ins&mdash;when they can keep them no longer.</P>

The bitter agonies I under|went in this my fir&s;t acquaintance with my|&s;elf, were &s;o far from throwing me into de&s;pair of that mercy which is over all God's works, that it proved motives of greater cir|cum&s;pection in my future conduct. The oftener I exerci&s;ed my&s;elf in meditations of this kind, the le&s;s was my anxiety; and by making the thoughts of death familiar, what was at fir&s;t &s;o terrible and &s;hocking, is now become the &s;weete&s;t of my enjoyments.

<P>POSTERITY wi&s;ely regulates the rewards due to men of learning, and equals them to the greate&s;t princes: Three thou&s;and years after their death, their honour is not tarni&s;h|ed by that of the greate&s;t heroes. Homer is as well known as Achilles. The able hi&s;to|rian, the famous poet, the great&mdash;the pious and ingenious philo&s;opher have an advant|age over the conqueror and the general. Twenty centuries after they are dead and rotten they &s;peak with as much eloquence and vivacity as when living; and all that read their writings perceive their genius. The heroes who have rendered them&s;elves famous by their actions, have not near &s;uch an a&s;cendant over our hearts; for he, at one
<PB N="66" REF="030567_0066_0FE7D52EB250FF28">
and the &s;ame in&s;tant, per&s;uades, engages and captivates the heart of one man &s;hut up in his clo&s;et at Stockholm, and of another that lives in the middle of Paris, London, &amp;c. &amp;c. Heroes are infinitely obliged to poets and hi&s;torians, but the latter are &s;eldom behold|en to the former. Achilles owes part of his glory to Homer: If there had been no hi&s;to|rians, it would &s;carce have been known that there ever was &s;uch a man as Alexander, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>EDUCATION is the ruling motive in mo&s;t of the actions of mankind; they are more or le&s;s tractable, according as they have been more or le&s;s cultivated in their youth. When they have been taught early to render them|&s;elves &s;ociable, to bend their tempers, and to accommodate their wills to tho&s;e of others, it grows into a cu&s;tom, and they become in|&s;en&s;ibly complai&s;ant, without thinking of being &s;o. In &s;hort, habit is to them a &s;econd nature.</P>
<P>We &s;hould ju&s;tly con&s;ider religion as the mo&s;t e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary qualification; at the &s;ame time children &s;hould be fitted for an appearance becoming their &s;tation in this world.

<P>THE end of learning is, to know God, and, in con&s;equence of that knowledge, to love

him, and to imitate him, as we may the nearer, by po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing our&s;elves of virtue.</P>
<P>WHAT &s;culpture is to a block of marble, education is to the human &s;oul. The phi|lo&s;opher, the &s;aint, the hero, the wi&s;e, the good, or the great man very often lie hid and concealed in a plebeian; which a proper education might have di&s;interred and brought to light.</P>
<P>THE educator's care &s;hould be, above all things to lay in his charge the foundation of religion and virtue.</P>
<P>PARENTS are more careful to be&s;tow wit on their children, than virtue; the art of &s;peaking well, rather than doing well; but their morals ought to be their greate&s;t con|cern.</P>
<P>AN indu&s;trious and virtuous education of children is a better inheritance for them than a great e&s;tate. To what purpo&s;e is it, &s;aid Crates, to heap up e&s;tates, and have no care what kind of heirs they leave them to?</P>
<P>THE highe&s;t learning is to be wi&s;e, and the greate&s;t wi&s;dom to be good.</P>

<P>IF our painful peregrination in &s;tudies be de&s;titute of the &s;upreme light, it is nothing el&s;e but a mi&s;erable kind of wandering.</P>
<P>THE mind ought &s;ometimes to be divert|ed, that it may turn to thinking the better.</P>

<P>GREAT men are always re&s;erved and mod|e&s;t, and being content with meriting prai&s;e, do not endeavour to court it; and for this they are the more prai&s;e worthy, becau&s;e, if vanity is pardonable, it is in the man who de&s;erves tho&s;e &s;hining compliments, which are &s;o becoming to many learned men. It is &s;aid, that Racine was a whole year in compo&s;ing his tragedy of Phaedra, the ma&s;|ter piece of the theatre, and before he com|mitted it to the &s;tage, con&s;ulted his friends a long time, corrected &s;everal pa&s;&s;ages by their advice, and waited for the &s;ucce&s;s of his per|formance, before he would pre&s;ume to pro|nounce it a good one. Prado wrote the &s;ame in a month's time; gave it out boldly to be acted, and a&s;&s;ured the public it was an excellent piece. But it happened to him as it often does to all half witted authors; his work quickly went to the chandlers' &s;hops,

<P>GREAT talents, &s;uch as honour, virtue, learning and parts, are above the generality of the world, who neither po&s;&s;e&s;s them them|&s;elves, nor judge of them rightly in others: But all people are judges of the le&s;&s;er talents, &s;uch as civility, affability and an obliging agreeable addre&s;s and manner: Becau&s;e they feel the good effects of them, as mak|ing &s;ociety ea&s;y and plea&s;ing.</P>
<P>ALMOST all the advantages or mi&s;carria|ges of our lives depend, in a great mea&s;ure, upon our education. Therefore it is great|ly the duty of all who have in ANY way the in&s;pection of this important affair, by every means po&s;&s;ible, to win young minds to im|provement; to the end that good parts may not take an evil turn, nor indifferent ones be totally lo&s;t for want of indu&s;trious cultiva|tion.</P>
<P>EDUCATION, when it works upon an in|genuous mind, brings out to view every la|tent perfection, which, without &s;uch helps are never able to make their appearance. And, if we take the trouble to look round, we &s;hall find very few, to whom nature has been &s;uch a niggard of her gifts, that they are not capable of &s;hining in one &s;phere of &s;cience or another: Since then there is a cer|tain bias towards knowledge, in almo&s;t eve|ry mind, which may be &s;trengthened and
<PB N="70" REF="030567_0070_0FE7D53D47950658">
improved by proper care; &s;ure, parents and others &s;hould con&s;ider, that, in the neglect of &s;o e&s;&s;ential a point, they do not commit a private injury only, as thereby they &s;tarve po&s;terity, and defraud our country of tho&s;e per&s;ons, who, under better management, might perhaps make an eminent figure.</P>
<P>INDEED, the difference in the manners and abilities of men proceeds more from educa|tion, than from any imperfections or advant|ages derived from their original formation.</P>
<P>YOUTH moreover is the proper and only &s;ea&s;on for education; for if it be neglected then, it will &s;urely be in vain to think of rem|edying the over&s;ight in more advanced years; it will be too late to think of &s;owing it, when maturity has rendered the mind &s;tubborn and inflexible, and when, in&s;tead of receiving the &s;eeds, it &s;hould be bringing forth the fruits of in&s;truction.</P>
<P>BUT there is one point in the article of ed|ucation, which is more e&s;&s;ential than any of the re&s;t: I mean the great care that ought to be taken to form youth to the principles of religion. Vice, if we may believe the gen|eral complaint, grows &s;o malignant nowa|days, that it is almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to keep young people from the &s;preading contagion; if we venture them abroad, and tru&s;t to chance or inclination, for the choice of their compa|ny; it is therefore virtue, and a perfect &s;en&s;e of their duty to God, which is the great and
<PB N="71" REF="030567_0071_0FE7D535FA471528">
valuable thing to be taught them. All other con&s;iderations and accompli&s;hments &s;hould give way, and be po&s;tponed to the&s;e; the&s;e are the &s;olid and &s;ub&s;tantial good we &s;hould labour to implant and fa&s;ten on their minds, neither &s;hould we cea&s;e till we have attained a true reli&s;h for them, and placed their &s;trength, their glory and their PLEASURE IN THEM.</P>
<P>IT is al&s;o of the fir&s;t con&s;equence in train|ing up youths of both &s;exes, that they be early in&s;pired with humanity, and particu|larly that its principles be implanted &s;trong|ly in their yet tender hearts, to guard them again&s;t inflicting wanton pain on tho&s;e ani|mals, which u&s;e or accident may occa&s;ion|ally put into their power.</P>

<HEAD>FRIENDSHIP.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>Friend&s;hip's a name to few confin'd,</L>
<L>The offspring of a noble mind;</L>
<L>A generous warmth which fills the brea&s;t,</L>
<L>And better felt than e'er expre&s;t.</L>
</LG>
<P>FRIENDSHIP is a &s;weet attraction of the heart, towards the merit we e&s;teem, or the perfections we admire; and produces a mu|tual inclination between two per&s;ons, to pro|mote each others' intere&s;t, knowledge, virtue and happine&s;s.</P>
<P>THERE is nothing &s;o common as preten|ces to friend&s;hip; though few know what it means, and fewer yet come up to its de|mands. By talking of it, we &s;et our&s;elves off; but when we enquire into it, we &s;ee our defects; and when we engage in it, we mu&s;t charge through abundance of difficulty. The
<PB N="76" REF="030567_0076_0FE7D546925FE350">
veneration it has challenged in every age, (the mo&s;t barbarous not excepted) is a &s;tand|ing te&s;timony of its excellence: And the more valuable it is, the more are we con|cerned to be in&s;tructed in it.</P>
<P>MONSIEUR DE SACY in his e&s;&s;ay upon friend&s;hip, treats to this effect: The friend|&s;hip which is to be recommended, is union of affections, &s;pringing from a generous re|&s;pect to virtue, and is maintained by a har|mony of manners. It is a great mi&s;take to call every trifling commerce by this &s;erious name; or to &s;uppo&s;e that empty compli|ments and vi&s;its of ceremony, when no more is intended than to pa&s;s the time, and &s;hew the equipage, &s;hould pa&s;s for a real and well e&s;tabli&s;hed friend&s;hip. The frequency of the practice will not wipe off the ab&s;urdity: &mdash;There is as wide a difference between a bully and a man of honour.</P>
<P>NOT that the&s;e amu&s;ements are to be found fault with, the innocence and convenience of which protects them, when they pa&s;s for nothing but what they are; but certainly they ought to be di&s;tingui&s;hed from their betters; and the language and profe&s;&s;ions bear a proportion to the real impre&s;&s;ion they have on our heart.</P>
<P>CONFORMITY of inclination is the life of friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>WHILST all are pur&s;uing this common in|tere&s;t, all are travelling the &s;ame cour&s;e,
<PB N="77" REF="030567_0077_0FE7D5972742A8C0">
nothing can break the union of their affec|tions and de&s;ires. The danger is only from irregular motions, and forgetting from which they &s;hould act. So long as we maintain a re&s;pect to this principle of union, and keep virtue on the throne, our humour and ca|price will be checked and &s;ubdued. If in|tere&s;t can maintain and form &s;ocieties, as we find it does, why &s;hould not tho&s;e who are actuated by a higher principle, (and with &s;uch only is our bu&s;ine&s;s) do as much, if not more.</P>
<P>IT may be &s;aid, from hence I conclude that all good men are friends, if virtue be the life of friend&s;hip. The con&s;equence holds good as far as e&s;teem goes, if they knew one another, they would value one a|nother. But though friend&s;hip is founded on e&s;teem, &s;o much that it cannot otherways &s;ub&s;i&s;t, there goes however, &s;omething more to form it; e&s;teem is a tribute due to merit in general; but friend&s;hip is an improvement made upon merit, and engages us in a very different degree.</P>
<P>SUCH impre&s;&s;ion has been made upon the heart as cannot be well de&s;cribed, and works like a mother's affection to her own children, above tho&s;e of &s;trangers, as amiable in them|&s;elves. Tho&s;e who would have friend&s;hip confined to the narrowe&s;t compa&s;s, have no|tions of it the mo&s;t &s;ublime; though num|ber, if practicable, may be highly u&s;eful.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="030567_0078_0FE7D54C4FFECD88">FOR to have but one friend, may &s;ome|times be to have none, or, which is the &s;ame thing, none when we want him. The cir|cum&s;tances of time, and place and ability too, make it proper that we have more than one bottom to venture in. The offices of friend&s;hip are various, to direct our choice, and rectify our mi&s;takes; to &s;u&s;tain our mis|fortunes, moderate our joys and the like. This may po&s;&s;ibly be better done by the care and endeavours of &s;everal. Not that I would have friend&s;hip governed by profit and convenience; a motive &s;o mean can produce nothing extraordinary. There is &s;ome|thing generous in the compo&s;ition, that looks at another man's advantage as much as his own.</P>
<P>AND that we may not talk without a pre|cedent for what we &s;ay, the &s;ages of old, who&s;e friend&s;hips were &s;o well cultivated, and became &s;o famous as to be handed down to the pre&s;ent time, even theirs were divided into &s;everal &s;treams. The mo&s;t polite na|tions, and their PHILOSOPHERS too, gave us examples of that &s;ort to build upon. It were difficult to determine, ju&s;t how many make a &s;ufficient quantity of friends, &s;ome fix the number to three, others allowing a greater latitude, but this rule will &s;erve us, <HI>the fewer the better;</HI> and he who thinks he has a great number of friends, has mo&s;t rea|&s;on to believe he has none. It was a good

return of Socrates, when his hou&s;e was thought too little "Would to God I could fill it with true friends;" &s;aid he: After all, if one &s;hould have a barn full, one would wi&s;h for no more than a clo&s;et would hold. Let the matter at lea&s;t turn upon this, &s;et|ting a&s;ide the rea&s;ons I have offered:&mdash;The difficulty we &s;hall find in the choice of our friends, will make us rejoice we have but few to chu&s;e. Of &s;uch importance is the work, it is &s;o hard to &s;ucceed, and &s;o danger|ous to mi&s;carry, &s;o &s;evere an inquiry into the inclination and merits of the per&s;on, and the experience we mu&s;t run through, before we are &s;afe in their hands, will convince us, that to gain three or four in the cour&s;e of our life, is to employ it well. Whence is it, &s;o many friend&s;hips clapt up on a &s;udden, which have the air of a veteran, not of a raw, undi&s;ciplined affection, and look like the meeting of old friends, not of new ones; whence can it be, the&s;e &s;o promi&s;ing, and kindly advances &s;hould &s;o &s;oon be overturn|ed? It is becau&s;e they began too &s;oon, and run up too fa&s;t: And is there any my&s;tery in this, that time &s;hould de&s;troy what we &s;et up without con&s;ulting him? We meet, and at fir&s;t &s;ight like one another well, the next thing is to &s;ay &s;o, the next in cour&s;e to be DEAR FRIENDS. We vow and &s;wear eternal amity; and when we go to con&s;idering, we find him out; we grow cool;&mdash;and at length

come to hate him. We &s;wing our&s;elves up by main force, and our own weight brings us down again. Would you contract a friend&s;hip that &s;hould la&s;t a long time, be a long time in contracting it.</P>
<P>PLUTARCH thus de&s;cribes the per&s;on a friend &s;hould be. As to the per&s;on of whom we are to make a friend, he mu&s;t be endowed with virtue, as a thing in it&s;elf lovely and de&s;irable, which con&s;i&s;ts of a &s;weet and o|bliging temper of mind, a lively readine&s;s in doing good offices; than which qualifi|cations, nothing is more rarely found in na|ture. To this a familiar conver&s;ation mu&s;t be added; for the per&s;on whom we de&s;ire to make our friend, mu&s;t not ca&s;ually be pick|ed up at a tavern, or an eating hou&s;e, nor at a promi&s;cuous meeting at a hor&s;e race; but one cho&s;en upon long and mature delibera|tion, confirmed by &s;ettled conver&s;e, and with whom, as the proverb &s;ays, <HI>"we have eaten a bu&s;hel of &s;alt."</HI></P>
<P>FROM a vicious man I &s;hould de&s;ire to &s;tand off altogether. By a vicious man I do not mean one liable to failings, as all men are, but one that acts without any regard to hon|our and con&s;cience. He is out of his ele|ment that makes an engagement that is not &s;upported only by principles of virtue. True friend&s;hip ju&s;tly founded is a ble&s;&s;ing, in which virtue has the &s;ole property.

<P>EQUALITY of birth and fortune, is by &s;ome made a point nece&s;&s;ary to a well in|&s;tructed friend&s;hip, and it mu&s;t be &s;aid the rule ever to be embraced, if we could, when we plea&s;ed, find as good men of our own rank, as el&s;ewhere. But con&s;idering there are but few of any rank fit to be cho&s;en, we &s;hould look at the &s;olid foundation of merit, and pa&s;s by mere accompli&s;hments. We make no league with the coat of arms and liveries, but the man, and with that part of the man too, that is con&s;idered ab&s;tractly from both. The&s;e things are not fixed to the freehold.</P>
<P>NOT but that one &s;hould carry it with that di&s;tance and regard which is due to per&s;ons of condition.

One would pre&s;ume farther upon the behaviour of a man genteelly bred, than another that wanted that advantage. But, on the other hand, there are in&s;tances to be met with, of &s;uch as have out &s;tretched expectation, as well as tho&s;e that have fallen &s;hort of it.

&s;hew, by a genteel behaviour, what he has lo&s;t, who has forfeited our friend&s;hip; by our generous conduct, to di&s;cover the fault is his, and make him &s;uffer in the reproach of his own brea&s;t. To be unconcerned at his misfortunes, or &s;ucce&s;s; to look upon him with the aver&s;ion of an enemy, is pa&s;&s;ion and not ju&s;t re&s;entment.

Is it &s;uch a mighty piece of bu&s;ine&s;s to do that for the deare&s;t per&s;on on earth, which we do to gratify a vain humour? What common humanity or applau&s;e will put us upon, &s;urely, among&s;t friends, is not to be reckon|ed an act of tran&s;cendent kindne&s;s, when it is no more than giving to another &s;elf, and paying of debts.

<P>DEMOSTHENES &s;aid, it becometh him, who receiveth a benefit from another man, for|ever to be &s;en&s;ible of it, but him that be&s;tow|ed it, pre&s;ently to forget it. He is unju&s;t, &s;aid Socrates who does not return de&s;erved thanks for any benefit, whether he be a friend or a foe.</P>
<P>THERE is no vice nor failing of man, that doth &s;o much unprinciple humanity, as in|gratitude: Since he who is guilty of it lives unworthy of his own &s;oul, that hath not vir|tue enough to be obliged, nor to acknowledge the true merits of the obliger.</P>

One day, a poor widow, encouraged by the fame of his genero&s;ity, came into the hall of this cardinal, with her only child, a beautiful maid, about fifteen years of age. When her turn came to be heard, among a croud of petitioners, the cardinal di&s;cerning the marks of an extraor|dinary mode&s;ty in her face and carriage, as al&s;o in her daughter, encouraged her to tell her wants freely&mdash;&s;he blu&s;hing&mdash;and, not without tears, thus addre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf to him. "My lord, I owe for the rent of my hou&s;e, five crowns, and &s;uch is my misfortune, that I have no other means to pay it, &s;ave what would break my heart, &s;ince my landlord threatens to force me to it; that is, to pro&s;|titute my only daughter, whom I have hith|erto, with great care, educated in virtue.&mdash; What I beg of your eminence is, that you

The cardinal, moved with admiration at the woman's vir|tue and innocent mode&s;ty, bade her be of good courage; then he immediately wrote a billet, and giving it into the widow's hands, Go, &s;aid he, to my &s;teward, and he &s;hall de|liver thee five crowns to pay thy rent. The poor woman overjoyed, and returning the cardinal a thou&s;and thanks, went directly to his &s;teward&mdash;and gave him the note, which when he had read, told her out fifty crowns. She, a&s;toni&s;hed at the meaning of it, and fearing it was the &s;teward's trick to try her hone&s;ty, refu&s;ed to take above five, &s;aying, &s;he mentioned no more to the cardinal, and &s;he was &s;ure it was &s;ome mi&s;take.

Where the idea of God, as a Being of &s;upreme excellence, doth not reign in the mind, where the will is not determined and fixed on him as our &s;upreme good, men are &s;trangers to that &s;acred and divine affection of love. Until this be done, we cannot be &s;aid to love God with all our heart.</P>
<P>How nece&s;&s;ary and u&s;eful a practice it is therefore for a chri&s;tian to meditate often on the tran&s;cendent perfections and worth of the ble&s;&s;ed God, to &s;urvey his attributes, and his grace in Chri&s;t Je&s;us; to keep in mind a con&s;tant idea of his &s;upreme excellence, and
<PB N="120" REF="030567_0120_0FE7D6384A4B9AD8">
frequently to repeat and confirm the choice of him as our highe&s;t hopes, our portion and our everla&s;ting good! This will keep the love of God warm at heart, and maintain the divine affection in its primitive life and vig|our. But if our ideas of the adorable and &s;upreme excellence of God grow faint and feeble, and &s;ink lower in the mind; if we lo&s;e the &s;ight of his amiable glories, the &s;en&s;e of his amazing love in the go&s;pel, his rich promi&s;es, and alluring grace; if we &s;hall a|bate the fervency of this &s;acred pa&s;&s;ion, our love to God grows cold by degrees, and &s;uf|fers great and gradual decays.</P>
<P>WHAT thanks do we owe to God, who, though we are &s;o much indebted to him, de|mands only our love, to pay off all our debts upon this con&s;ideration; doth he not &s;hew us, by placing the precept of love above all others, how, poor and in&s;olvent as we are, we may clear our&s;elves of all that we owe him.</P>
<P>IT is &s;urely impo&s;&s;ible to read the life and death of our ble&s;&s;ed Saviour, without renew|ing and increa&s;ing in our hearts, that love and reverence, and gratitude to him, which is &s;o ju&s;tly due for all he did and &s;uffered for us; every word that fell from his lips is more precious than all the trea&s;ures of the earth, for his are the words of eternal life! They mu&s;t therefore be laid up in our hearts,
<PB N="121" REF="030567_0121_0FE7D5DEE1E65458">
and be con&s;tantly referred to, on all occa&s;ions, as the rule and direction of all our actions.</P>
<P>IT is impo&s;&s;ible to love God, without de|&s;iring to plea&s;e him, and, as far as we are a|ble, to re&s;emble him; therefore the love of God mu&s;t lead to every virtue in the highe&s;t degree; and we may be &s;ure we do not tru|ly love him, if we content our&s;elves with a|voiding flagrant &s;ins, and do not &s;trive in good earne&s;t, to reach the greate&s;t degree of perfection we are capable of, by his help.</P>
<P>WE cannot po&s;&s;ibly exceed in the mea&s;ure of our love to God, to whom rea&s;on as well as revelation directs us to offer the be&s;t of our affections, and from whom alone we can hope for that happine&s;s, which it is our na|ture ince&s;&s;antly to de&s;ire.</P>

<P>LOVE your neighbour for God's &s;ake, and God for your Saviour's &s;ake, who creat|ed all things for your &s;ake, and redeemed you for his mercy's &s;ake. If your love hath any other motive, it is fal&s;e love; if your motive hath any other end, it is &s;elf love. If you neglect your love to your neighbour, in vain you profe&s;s your love to God; for

by your love to God, your love to your neighbour is acquired; and by your love to your neighbour, your love to God is nour|i&s;hed.</P>
<P>ALL men of e&s;tates are, in effect, but tru&s;|tees for the benefit of the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, and will be &s;o reckoned when they are to give an ac|count.</P>
<P>WE may hate men's vices without any ill will to their per&s;ons; but we cannot help de&s;pi&s;ing tho&s;e that have no kind of virtue to recommend them.</P>
<P>HE that makes any thing his chief good, wherein virtue, rea&s;on and humanity do not bear a part, can never do the offices of friend|&s;hip, ju&s;tice or liberality.</P>
<P>A REGARD to decency and the common punctilios of life, has been often &s;erviceable to &s;ociety. It has kept many a married cou|ple un&s;eparated, and frequently pre&s;erves a neighbourly intercour&s;e, where love and friend&s;hip have both been wanting.</P>
<P>IT is providential that our affection di|mini&s;hes in proportion as our friend's power increa&s;es. Affection is of le&s;s importance, whenever a per&s;on can &s;upport him&s;elf. It is on this account that younger brothers are oft beloved more than their elders; and that Benjamin is the favourite.</P>
<P>"LOVE worketh no ill to his neighbour;" therefore, if we have true benevolence, we will never do any thing injurious to individ|uals,

or to &s;ociety.

There is no occa&s;ion, great or &s;mall, on which you may not &s;afely apply this rule, for the di|rection of your conduct; and whil&s;t our hearts hone&s;tly adhere to it, we can never be guilty of any &s;ort of inju&s;tice, or unkindne&s;s.</P>

<HEAD>MARRIAGE.</HEAD>
<P>MARRIAGE is certainly a condition, upon which the happine&s;s or mi&s;ery of life does very much depend; more than indeed mo&s;t people think beforehand. To be confined to live with one perpetually, for whom we have no liking and e&s;teem, mu&s;t certainly be an unea&s;y &s;tate. There had need be a great many good qualities to reconcile a con&s;tant conver&s;ation with one, where there is &s;ome &s;hare of kindne&s;s, but without love, the very be&s;t of all good qual|ities will never make a con&s;tant conver&s;ation

ea&s;y and delightful. And whence proceed tho&s;e innumerable dome&s;tic mi&s;eries, that plague and utterly confound &s;o many fami|lies, but from want of love and kindne&s;s in the wife or hu&s;band; from the&s;e come their neglect and carele&s;s management of affairs at home, and their profu&s;e extravagant ex|pen&s;es abroad. In a word, it is not ea&s;y, as it is not needful, to recount the evils that a|ri&s;e abundantly, from the want of conjugal affection only. And &s;ince this is &s;o certain, a man or woman runs the mo&s;t fearful haz|ard that can be, who marries without their affection in them&s;elves, and without good a&s;&s;urances of it in the other.</P>
<P>LET love advi&s;e you before you chu&s;e, and your choice be fixed before you marry. Remember the happine&s;s or mi&s;ery of your life depends upon this one act, and that nothing but death can di&s;&s;olve the knot.</P>
<P>A SINGLE life is doubtle&s;s preferable to a married one, where prudence and affection do not accompany the choice; but where they do, there is no terre&s;trial happine&s;s e|qual to the married &s;tate.</P>
<P>THERE cannot be too near an equality, too exact a harmony betwixt a married cou|ple; it is a &s;tep of &s;uch weight as calls for all our fore&s;ight and penetration, and, e&s;pe|cially the temper and education mu&s;t be at|tended to. In unequal matches the men are

<P>MARRIAGES founded on affection are the mo&s;t happy. Love (&s;ays Addi&s;on) ought to have &s;hot its roots deep, and to be well grown before we enter into that &s;tate. There is nothing which more nearly concerns the peace of mankind&mdash;it is his choice in this re&s;pect on which his happine&s;s or mi&s;ery for life depends.</P>
<P>THOUGH Solomon's de&s;cription of a wi&s;e and good woman, may be thought too mean and mechanical for this refined generation; yet certain it is, that the bu&s;ine&s;s of a family is the mo&s;t profitable and honorable &s;tudy they can employ them&s;elves in.</P>
<P>THE be&s;t dowry to advance the marriage of a young lady is, when &s;he has in her counte|nance, mildne&s;s; in her &s;peech, wi&s;dom; in her behaviour, mode&s;ty; and in her life, virtue.</P>
<P>BETTER is a portion in a wife, than with a wife.</P>
<P>AN inviolable fidelity, good humour and complacency of temper in a wife, outlive all the charms of a fine face, and make the de|cays of it invi&s;ible.</P>
<P>THE &s;ure&s;t way of governing both a pri|vate family and a kingdom, is, for a hu&s;band

<P>SWEETNESS of temper, affection to her hu&s;band and attention to his intere&s;t, con&s;ti|tute the duties of a wife, and form the ba&s;is of matrimonial felicity. The idea of power on either &s;ide, &s;hould be totally bani&s;hed.

<P>TRUE merit is not afraid of being effaced by that of others. We judge of the merit of men by the u&s;efulne&s;s of their actions, and there are a great many men valued in the world, who have no other merit than vices profitable to commerce and &s;ociety. The more true merit a man has, the more does he applaud it in others. Real merit gains a man the e&s;teem of good men, but it is only fate and chance that gains him that of the multitude.</P>

<P>SUPERIORITY of virtue is the mo&s;t unpar|donable provocation that can be given to a ba&s;e mind. Innocence is too amiable to be beheld without hatred; and it is a &s;acred ac|knowledgment of merit which the wicked are betrayed into, when they pur&s;ue good men with violence. This behaviour vi&s;ibly proceeds from a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s in them, that other people's virtues upbraid their own want of it.</P>
<P><PB N="129" REF="030567_0129_0FE7D5ED949CB008">WE ought not to judge of men's merits by their qualifications, but by the u&s;e they make of them.</P>
<P>IT is a thing exceedingly rare to di&s;tingui&s;h virtue and fortune. The mo&s;t impious, if pro&s;perous, are always applauded; the mo&s;t virtuous, if unpro&s;perous, are &s;ure to be de&s;|pi&s;ed.</P>

<P>IT is true greatne&s;s that con&s;titutes glory, and virtue is the cau&s;e of both. But vice and ignorance taint the blood, and an un|worthy behaviour degrades and di&s;ennobles the man, more than birth and fortune ag|grandize and exalt him.</P>

<HEAD>MODESTY AND IMPUDENCE.</HEAD>
<P>MODESTY has a natural tendency to conceal a man's talents, as im|pudence di&s;plays them to the utmo&s;t, and has been the only cau&s;e why many have ri&s;en in the world, under all the di&s;advanta|ges of low birth and little merit. Such in|dolence and incapacity is there in the gen|erality of mankind, that they are apt to re|ceive a man for whatever he has a mind to put him&s;elf off for, and admit his over bear|ing airs, as proofs of that merit which he a&s;|&s;umes to him&s;elf.</P>
<P>A DECENT a&s;&s;urance &s;eems to be the nat|ural attendant on virtue; and few men can di&s;tingui&s;h impudence from it; as, on the other hand, diffidence being the natural re|&s;ult of vice and folly, has drawn di&s;grace up|on mode&s;ty, which in outward appearance &s;o nearly re&s;embles it.</P>
<P>AS impudence, though really a vice, has the &s;ame effect upon a man's fortune, as if it were a virtue, &s;o we may ob&s;erve, that it is almo&s;t as difficult to be obtained, and is, in that re&s;pect, di&s;tingui&s;hed from all the other vices which are acquired with little pains, and continually increa&s;e upon indulgence.
<PB N="139" REF="030567_0139_0FE7D5FDA4915018">
Many a man being &s;en&s;ible that mode&s;ty is exceedingly prejudicial to him in making his fortune, has re&s;olved to be impudent, and put a bold face upon the matter; but it is ob&s;ervable, that &s;uch people have &s;eldom &s;ucceeded in their attempts, but have been obliged to relap&s;e into their primitive mod|e&s;ty. Nothing carries a man through the world, like a true, genuine, natural impu|dence; its counterfeit is good for nothing, nor can ever &s;upport it&s;elf. If any thing can give a mode&s;t man more a&s;&s;urance, it mu&s;t be &s;ome advantages of fortune which chance procured to him. Riches naturally gain a man a favourable reception in the world, and give merit a double lu&s;tre, when a per&s;on is endowed with it. It is wonder|ful to ob&s;erve what airs of &s;uperiority fools and knaves, with large po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, give them|&s;elves, above men of the greate&s;t merit, in poverty. Nor do the men of merit make a|ny &s;trong oppo&s;ition to tho&s;e u&s;urpations, but rather &s;eem to favour them by the mod|e&s;ty of their behaviour.</P>
<P>To make wi&s;dom agree with imudence, is as difficult as to reconcile vice and mode&s;ty. The&s;e are the reflections which have occur|red upon this &s;ubject of mode&s;ty and impu|dence, and I hope the reader will not be di&s;|plea&s;ed to &s;ee them wrought into the follow|ing allegory.</P>
<P><PB N="140" REF="030567_0140_0FE7D65CEBBE6128">JUPITER in the beginning joined Virtue, Wi&s;dom and Confidence together; and Vice, Folly and Diffidence; and thus connected, &s;ent them into the world. But though he thought he had matched them with great judgment, and &s;aid, that Confidence was the natural companion of Virtue, and that Vice de&s;erved to be attended with Diffidence, they had not gone far before di&s;&s;en&s;ion aro&s;e among them. Wi&s;dom, who was the guide of the one company, was always accu&s;tomed, before &s;he ventured on any road, however beaten, to examine is carefully, to enquire whither it led; what dangers difficulties, or hindrances might po&s;&s;ibly, or probably occur in it. In the&s;e deliberations &s;he u&s;ually con|&s;umed &s;ome time, which delay was very di&s;|plea&s;ing to Confidence, who was always in|clined to hurry on, without much fore|thought or deliberation, in the fir&s;t road he met. Wi&s;dom and Virtue were in&s;eparable; but Confidence one day following his impet|uous nature, advanced a con&s;iderable way before his guides and companions, and not feeling any want of their company, he never enquired after them, nor ever met with them more. In like manner, the other &s;ociety, though joined by Jupiter, di&s;agreed and &s;ep|arated. As Folly &s;aw very little way before her, &s;he had nothing to determine concern|ing the goodne&s;s of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> nor could give the preference to one above another, and
<PB N="141" REF="030567_0141_0FE7D6035E442F28">
their want of re&s;olution increa&s;ed by Diffi|dence, who, with her doubts and &s;cruples always retarded the journey. This was a great annoyance to Vice, who loved not to hear of difficulties and delays, and was nev|er &s;atisfied without his full career in whatev|er his inclinations led him to. Folly, he knew, though &s;he hearkened to Diffidence, would be ea&s;ily managed when alone, there|fore, as a vicious hor&s;e throws its rider, he openly beat away this controller of his plea|&s;ures, and proceeded on his journey with Folly, from whom he is in&s;eparable. Con|fidence and Diffidence, being after this man|ner both thrown loo&s;e from their re&s;pective companions, wandered about for &s;ome time; till at la&s;t chance led them at the &s;ame time to the &s;ame village. Confidence went directly up to the great hou&s;e, which belonged to Wealth, the lord of the village, and without &s;taying for a porter, intruded him&s;elf imme|diately into the innermo&s;t appartments, where he found Vice and Folly were receiv|ed before him. He joined the train, recom|mended him&s;elf very quickly to his landlord, and entered into &s;uch familiarity with Vice, that he was enli&s;ted in the &s;ame company with Folly. They were frequent gue&s;ts with Wealth, and from that moment in&s;eparable. Diffidence in the mean time, not daring to approach the great hou&s;e, accepted of an in|vitation from one of the tenants, and enter|ing
<PB N="142" REF="030567_0142_0FE7D662A99DA020">
the cottage found Wi&s;dom and Virtue, who, being repul&s;ed by the landlord, had re|tired thither.</P>
<P>VIRTUE took compa&s;&s;ion on her, and Wi&s;|dom found from her temper, that &s;he would ea&s;ily improve, &s;o they admitted her into their &s;ociety. Accordingly by their means, &s;he altered, in a little time, &s;omewhat of her manner; and becoming much more amiable and engaging, was now called by the name of Mode&s;ty.</P>
<P>As ill company has a greater effect than good. Confidence, though more refractory to coun&s;el and example, degenerated &s;o far by the &s;ociety of Vice and Folly, as to pa&s;s by the name of Impudence.</P>
<P>MANKIND, who &s;aw the&s;e &s;ocieties as Ju|piter fir&s;t joined them, and knew nothing of tho&s;e mutual di&s;&s;en&s;ions, are thereby led into &s;trange mi&s;takes, and whenever they &s;ee Im|pudence, make account of Virtue and Wi&s;|dom; and oft when they ob&s;erve Mode&s;ty, call her attendants Vice and Folly.</P>

<P>THERE &s;carce can be named one quality that is amiable in a woman, which is not be|coming in a man, not excepting even mode&s;|ty and gentlene&s;s of nature.</P>
<P>THE mode&s;ty of women prevails more than their power, riches or beauty. Mod|e&s;ty in your di&s;cour&s;e, will give a lu&s;tre to truth, and an excu&s;e to your errors.</P>
<P>IT has been &s;aid, that when Jove created the pa&s;&s;ions, he a&s;&s;igned to every one of them its de&s;tined abode; mode&s;ty was forgotten, and when &s;he was introduced to him, he knew not where to place her; &s;he was therefore or|dered to con&s;ort with all the re&s;t; ever &s;ince that time &s;he is in&s;eparable from them; &s;he is the friend of truth, and betrays the lie that dares attack it; &s;he is in a &s;trict and in|timate unity with love; &s;he always attends, and frequently di&s;covers and proclaims it; love, in a word, lo&s;es its charms, whenever it appears without her. There is not a more glorious ornament for either &s;ex, than mod|e&s;ty.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t of all virtues is innocence, the next is mode&s;ty. If we bani&s;h mode&s;ty out of the world, &s;he carries away with her half the virtues that are in it.</P>

<P>NOTWITHSTANDING the degeneracy and meanne&s;s that is crept into human nature, there are a thou&s;and actions in which it breaks through its original corrup|tion, and &s;hews what it once was, and what it will be hereafter.

broken pillars and obeli&s;ks, and a mag|nificence in confu&s;ion. Virtue and wi&s;dom are continually employed in clearing the ru|ins, removing the&s;e di&s;orderly heaps, recov|ering the noble piles that lie buried under them, and adju&s;ting them as well as po&s;&s;ible, according to their ancient &s;ymmetry and beau|ty. A happy education, conver&s;ation with the fine&s;t &s;pirits, looking abroad into the works of nature, and ob&s;ervations upon man|kind, are the greate&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;tances to this nece&s;|&s;ary and glorious work.

<P>DISCOURSES of religion and morality, and reflections upon human nature are the be&s;t means we can make u&s;e of to improve our minds, and gain a true knowledge of our|&s;elves; and con&s;equently to recover our &s;ouls out of the vice, ignorance and prejudice which naturally cleave to them.</P>

<P>IT is with the mind as with the will and appetites; for, as after we have tried a thou&s;|and plea&s;ures, and turned from one enjoy|ment to another, we find no re&s;t to our de|&s;ires, till we at la&s;t fix them upon the &s;ov|ereign good; &s;o in pur&s;uit of knowledge, we meet with no tolerable &s;atisfaction to our minds, till after we are weary with tracing other methods, we turn them upon the one &s;upreme and unerring truth.

Cheerfulne&s;s, (as an admira|ble author ob&s;erves) is here in&s;en&s;ibility, and dejection, &s;ullenne&s;s; its hard&s;hips are without honour, and its labours without reward. Not|with&s;tanding this, there is no &s;tation more favourable to the growth of virtue, where the &s;eeds of it are previou&s;ly &s;own in the mind.</P>
<P>But when poverty is felt in the utmo&s;t ex|treme, it then becomes exce&s;&s;ively dangerous, and &s;ome deviations from rectitude, are per|haps impo&s;&s;ible to be avoided.</P>
<P>VICE is covered by wealth, and virtue by poverty.</P>

Prai&s;e is the re|ward of noble actions: What is more ani|mating to our commanders both by &s;ea and land, than the a&s;&s;urance of their country's applau&s;e, for their heroic behaviour. Prai&s;e is only to be given when truly merited, and then not in the pre&s;ence of the party to whom it is due. When Telemachus repaired to the a&s;&s;embly of the confederate kings, after the death of Adra&s;tus, and the Daunians de&s;ired peace, we are told, that as &s;oon as they e&s;pied him, they were all hu&s;hed in expectation to hear him di&s;cour&s;e; this made him blu&s;h, and he could not be prevailed upon to &s;peak. The prai&s;es that were given him by public acclamations, on account of his late action, added to his ba&s;h|fulne&s;s &s;o, that he would gladly have hid him|&s;elf.

Prai&s;es are apt to corrupt men; they fill them full of them&s;elves, and render them vain and pre&s;umptuous; we ought e|qually to merit and decline them; there is a great likene&s;s between the ju&s;te&s;t and the fal&s;e&s;t

"Our wants" &s;ays the late Bi&s;hop of London (Dr. Gib&s;on) "are daily, and the temptations which draw our hearts from God, to the things of this world are daily, and upon both the&s;e accounts our prayers ought al&s;o to be daily."</P>

&mdash;For the Sabbath, the great day of re&s;t, &amp;c." Let your prayers be ever &s;o pro|per in the form and expre&s;&s;ion, or let your heart accompany them with a devotion ever &s;o inten&s;e, &s;till be very careful to avoid the dangerous error of imagining that any merit ari&s;es from the mo&s;t perfect performance of them. They become acceptable to God through Chri&s;t alone; and are the means, in|deed, to make you good; but the goodne&s;s it&s;elf is not in them, no more than a favour among men can be &s;aid to be de&s;erved, be|cau&s;e a&s;ked with humility, propriety and el|egance. If therefore you were to tru&s;t merely in them, 'twould be making idols of your pray|ers;&mdash;it would be putting them in the place of CHRIST'S atonement, which is quite con|trary to praying, (as an unworthy &s;inner) in the name of CHRIST.</P>
<P>IF we have not recour&s;e to God with the mind and thoughts that we ought, it looks as if we expected nothing from him; or rather, (&s;eeing our remi&s;&s;ne&s;s and indolence) it may be &s;aid, that we do not de&s;erve to obtain&mdash;that we do not value the things that we &s;eem to a&s;k. Yet, God would have what is a&s;ked of him, a&s;ked with earne&s;tne&s;s; and far from taking our importunity ill, he is in &s;ome manner well plea&s;ed with it. For, in fine, He is the only debtor who thinks him&s;elf obliged for the demands that are made upon him. He is the only one that pays what we never lent him.

The more he &s;ees us pre&s;s him, the more liberal he is. He even gives that he does not owe. If we coldly a&s;k, he defers his liberalities; not becau&s;e he does not love to give, but be|cau&s;e he would be pre&s;&s;ed, and becau&s;e vio|lence is agreeable to him.</P>

St. Paul ingeniou&s;ly explains what Chri&s;t teaches in the Go&s;pel, that heaven is taken by violence; "do violence to God," &s;ays he, &s;eize the kingdom of heaven. He that forbids us to touch another's goods rejoices to have his own invaded: He that condemns the violence of avarice, prai&s;es that of faith.</P>

<P>GOING to prayer with bad affections, is like paying one's levee in an undre&s;s.</P>

be fervent, inten&s;e, earne&s;t and importunate. Our de&s;ires mu&s;t be la&s;ting, and our prayers frequent and continual. God hears us not the &s;ooner for our many words, but much the &s;ooner for our earne&s;t de&s;ire. A long prayer and a &s;hort differ not in their capaci|ties of being accepted; for both of them take their value, according to the fervency of &s;pirit, and the charity of the prayer. That prayer which is &s;hort, by rea&s;on of an impatient &s;pi|rit, dullne&s;s, &s;light of holy things, or indiffer|ency of de&s;ires, is very often criminal, always imperfect; and that prayer which is long out of o&s;tentation, &s;uper&s;tition, or a trifling &s;pirit, is as criminal and imperfect, as the other in their &s;everal in&s;tances.</P>
<P>WE mu&s;t be careful in all our prayers to attend our pre&s;ent work, having a pre&s;ent mind, not wandering upon impertinent things, nor di&s;tant from our words, much le&s;s con|trary to them.</P>
<P>OFTEN pray, and you &s;hall pray oftener; and when you are accu&s;tomed to frequent devotion, it will &s;o in&s;en&s;ibly unite to your nature and affections, that it will become a trouble to you to omit your u&s;ual or appoint|ed prayers; and what you obtain at fir&s;t by doing violence to your inclinations, at la&s;t will be left with as much unea&s;ine&s;s, as that by which at fir&s;t it entered.</P>

<HEAD>RELIGION.</HEAD>
<P>RELIGION is a thing much talked of, but little under&s;tood; much pre|tended to, but very little practi&s;ed; and the rea&s;on why it is &s;o ill practi&s;ed, is, becau&s;e it is &s;o little under&s;tood; knowledge, there|fore, mu&s;t precede religion, &s;ince it is nece&s;|&s;ary to be wi&s;e, in order to be virtuous, it mu&s;t be known to whom, and upon what ac|count duty is owing, otherwi&s;e it never can be

rightly paid. It mu&s;t therefore be con&s;id|ered, that God is the object of all religion, and that the &s;oul is the &s;ubject wherein it exi&s;ts and re&s;ides. From the &s;oul it mu&s;t proceed, and to God it mu&s;t be directed, as to that Almighty Being who&s;e power alone could create a rational &s;oul, and who&s;e goodne&s;s only could move him to make it capable of an eternal felicity, which infinite bounty of God has laid a perpetual obligation upon the &s;oul to a con&s;tant love, obedience and adoration of him, and to an undoubted a&s;&s;urance, that the &s;ame power and goodne&s;s that created man, will forever pre|&s;erve him and protect him, if he per&s;everes in the &s;incere performance of his duty. The body can have no other &s;hare in religion, than by its ge&s;tures to repre&s;ent and di&s;cover the bent and inclination of the mind, which rep|re&s;entations al&s;o are but too often fal&s;e and treacherous, deluding tho&s;e that behold them, into the opinion of a &s;aint, but truly di&s;cov|ering a notorious hypocrite to God, who &s;ees how di&s;tant his intentions are from his pre|tences. People are as much deceived them|&s;elves, as they deceive others, who think to u&s;e religion as they do their be&s;t clothes, on|ly wear it to church and on &s;undays, to ap|pear fine, and make a &s;hew, and with them, as &s;oon as they come home again, lay it a|&s;ide carefully, for fear of wearing it out: That religion is good for nothing that is
<PB N="190" REF="030567_0190_0FE7D6BCF0045FA8">
made of &s;o &s;light a &s;tuff, as will not endure wearing, which ought to be as con&s;tant a covering for the &s;oul, as the &s;kin is to the body, not to be divided from it; divi&s;ion be|ing the ruin of both. Nor mu&s;t it be thought that religion con&s;i&s;ts only in bending the knees, which is a &s;itting po&s;ture of humility; but in the fervent and humble adoration of the &s;oul. Nor in the lifting up of the hands and eyes, but in the warmth of the affections. Outward ge&s;tures and decent behaviour are things very fit and rea&s;onable, being all that the body can pay; but it is inward &s;inceri|ty alone that can render them both accepta|ble. Much le&s;s does religion con&s;i&s;t in di&s;|mal looks and &s;our faces, which only &s;hew that it is very unpalatable to tho&s;e who make them; and it &s;eems as if they were &s;wallow|ing &s;omething that went grievou&s;ly again&s;t their &s;tomachs. It is likewi&s;e to be con&s;id|ered, the frequency and fervency of prayers gives it acceptance, not the length of them. That one prayer rightly addre&s;&s;ed to God from a well di&s;po&s;ed mind, is more effica|cious than ten &s;ermons carele&s;sly heard, and more carele&s;sly practi&s;ed. But hearing be|ing a much ea&s;ier duty than praying, becau&s;e it can often change into &s;leeping, is there|fore preferred to it, by a great many people. But if, in the end, their profound ignorance will not excu&s;e them, I am &s;ure their &s;tupid ob&s;tinacy never will. But there are &s;o ma|ny

virtues required in order to praying right|ly, that people think, perhaps, that it would take up too much time and pains to acquire them. And they are much in the right, if they think their prayers will be in&s;ignificant without them, and that an ill man can never pray well, and to purpo&s;e, for the &s;tream will always partake of the fountain. And if the mind, which is the fountain of all our addre&s;&s;es to God, be vicious and impure, the prayers, which proceed from it, mu&s;t needs be &s;ullied with the &s;ame pollutions. But, on the contrary, if the mind be once made vir|tuous, all that proceeds from it will be plea&s;|ing and accepted. And as to dejected looks and a &s;orrowful countenance, they are no wi&s;e graceful in religion, which is &s;o far from being a melancholy thing, that it can never appear di&s;plea&s;ing, or tire&s;ome to a mind where wi&s;dom and virtue do not fir&s;t &s;eem trouble&s;ome; for wi&s;dom, in&s;tructing the &s;oul to act rea&s;onably, in&s;tructs it likewi&s;e to &s;erve and obey God readily and chearfully; for that which appears rea&s;onable to a wi&s;e man, will always appear delightful; and re|ligion is that very &s;ame rea&s;on and wi&s;dom, who&s;e ways are ways of plea&s;antne&s;s, and all who&s;e paths are peace.</P>

<P>TRUE repentance is that &s;aving grace wrought in the &s;oul, by the &s;pir|it of God, whereby a &s;inner is made to &s;ee, and be &s;en&s;ible of his &s;in, is grieved and humbled before God on account of it, not &s;o much for the puni&s;hment to which &s;in has made him liable, as that thereby God is di&s;|honoured and offended, his laws violated, and their own &s;oul polluted and defiled: And this grief ari&s;es from love to God, and is ac|companied with a hatred of &s;in, a fixed re&s;o|lution to for&s;ake it, and expectation of fa|vour and forgivene&s;s through the merits of CHRIST; this is evangelical repentance. The in&s;en&s;ibility of a &s;inner, the want of regret and penitence, after having &s;inned provokes God more than the &s;in it&s;elf.</P>

<HEAD>TRUTH.</HEAD>
<P>A LIE is a de&s;perate cow|ardice. &mdash;It is to fear man and brave God.</P>
<LG>
<L>Truth be your guide, di&s;dain ambition's call,</L>
<L>And if you fall with truth, you greatly fall.</L>
</LG>
<P>THERE are lying looks, as well as lying words; di&s;&s;embling &s;miles, deceiving &s;igns, and even a lying &s;ilence.</P>
<P>NOTHING appears &s;o low and mean as ly|ing and di&s;&s;imulations; and it is ob&s;ervable that only weak animals endeavour to &s;upply by craft the defects of &s;trength. Virtue &s;corns a lie for its cover, and truth needs no orator.</P>
<P>A LIAR is a hector towards God, and a coward towards man.</P>
<P>SINCERITY of heart, and integrity of life, are the great and indi&s;pen&s;able ornaments of human nature.</P>
<P>THAT kind of deceit which is commonly laid, and &s;moothly carried on under di&s;gui&s;e of friend&s;hip, is of all others the mo&s;t impi|ous and dete&s;table.</P>
<P>NOT to intend what you &s;peak, is to give your heart the lie with your tongue; not to

perform what you promi&s;e, is to give your tongue the lie with your actions.</P>
<P>NOTHING can be more unju&s;t or ungener|ous than to play upon the belief of a harm|le&s;s per&s;on; to make him &s;uffer for his good opinion, and fare the wor&s;e for thinking me hone&s;t.</P>
<P>IT would be more obliging to &s;ay plainly, we cannot do what is de&s;ired, than to amu&s;e people with fair words; which often put them upon fal&s;e mea&s;ures.</P>
<P>GREAT men mu&s;t go and meet with truth, if they are de&s;irous to know it; for none will carry it to them.</P>
<P>THERE is no vice that doth &s;o cover a man with &s;hame, as to be fal&s;e and perfidious.</P>
<P>IT is ea&s;y to tell a lie, hard to tell but a lie. One lie needs many more to maintain it.</P>
<P>SINCERITY is to &s;peak as we think; to do as we pretend and profe&s;s; to perform and make good our promi&s;e, and really to be what we would appear to be.</P>
<P>LYING is a vice &s;o very infamous, that even the greate&s;t liars cannot bear it in others.</P>
<P>THE Egyptian princes were u&s;ed to wear a golden chain, be&s;et with precious &s;tones, which they &s;tiled truth, intimating that to be the mo&s;t illu&s;trious ornament.</P>

<P>HOW &s;peedily will the con&s;um|mation of all things commence! for yet a ve|ry little while, and the commi&s;&s;ioned Arch|angel lifts up his hand to heaven, and &s;wears by the Almighty name, that "TIME SHALL BE NO LONGER." Then abu&s;ed opportuni|ties will never return, and new opportuni|ties will never more be offered. Then &s;hould negligent mortals wi&s;h ever &s;o pa&s;&s;ionately for a few hours&mdash;a few moments only&mdash;to be thrown back from the opening eternity; thou|&s;ands of worlds would not be able to pro|cure the grant.</P>

<P>MAKE the mo&s;t of your minutes, &s;ays Au|relius, and be good for &s;omething while you can.</P>
<P>KNOW the true value of time; &s;natch, &s;eize and enjoy every moment of it. No idlene&s;s, no lazine&s;s, no procra&s;tination; never put off till tomorrow what you can do today.</P>
<P>WE &s;hould read over our lives as well as books, take a &s;urvey of our actions, and make an in&s;pection into the divi&s;ion of our time. King Alfred (that truly great and wi&s;e mon|arch) is recorded to have divided the day and night into three parts: Eight hours he allotted to eat and &s;leep in, eight for bu&s;i|ne&s;s and recreation, and eight he dedicated to &s;tudy and prayer.</P>
<P>TO come but once into the world, and tri|fle away our right u&s;e of it, making that a burthen which was given for a ble&s;&s;ing, is &s;trange infatuation.</P>
<P>TIME is what we want mo&s;t, but what we u&s;e wor&s;t; for which we mu&s;t all account, when time &s;hall be no more.</P>
<P>THERE is but little need to drive away that time by fooli&s;h diverti&s;ements, which flies away &s;o &s;wiftly of it&s;elf, and when once gone, can never be recalled.</P>
<P><PB N="225" REF="030567_0225_0FE7D76DD9FFEDF8">AN idle per&s;on is a kind of mon&s;ter in the creation; all nature is bu&s;y about him. How wretched is it to hear people complain, that the day hangs heavy upon them, that they do not know what to do with them&s;elves. How mon&s;trous are &s;uch expre&s;&s;ions among creatures, who can apply them&s;elves to the duties of religion and meditation; to the reading of u&s;eful books; who may exerci&s;e them&s;elves in the pur&s;uits of knowledge and virtue, and every hour of their lives, make them&s;elves wi&s;er and better.</P>
<P>SHOULD the greate&s;t part of people &s;it down, and draw a particular account of their time, what a &s;hameful bill would it be? So much extraordinary for eating, drinking and &s;leeping, beyond what nature requires; &s;o much in revelling and wantonne&s;s; &s;o much for the recovery of la&s;t night's intemperance; &s;o much for gaming, plays and ma&s;querades; &s;o much in paying and receiving formal and impertinent vi&s;its, in idle and fooli&s;h prat|ing, in cen&s;uring and reviling our neigh|bours; &s;o much in dre&s;&s;ing, and talking of fa&s;hions; and &s;o much lo&s;t and wa&s;ted in do|ing nothing.</P>
<P>THERE is no man but hath a &s;oul, and, if he will look carefully to that, he need not complain for want of bu&s;ine&s;s. Where there are &s;o many corruptions to mortify, &s;o many inclinations to watch over, &s;o many tempta|tions to re&s;i&s;t, the graces of God to improve,

and former neglects of all the&s;e to lament, &s;ure he can never want &s;ufficient employ|ment. For all the&s;e require time, and &s;o men at their deaths find; for tho&s;e who have lived carele&s;sly, and wa&s;ted their time, would then give them all to redeem it.</P>
<P>THIS was a memorable practice of Ve&s;pa|fian, through the whole cour&s;e of his life; he called him&s;elf to an account every night for the actions of the pa&s;t day, and &s;o often as he found he had &s;kipped any one day without doing &s;ome good, he entered upon his diary this memorial, <HI>"I have lo&s;t a day."</HI></P>
<P>IF time, like money, could be laid by, while one was not u&s;ing it&mdash;there might be &s;ome excu&s;e for the idlene&s;s of half the world &mdash;but yet not a full one; for even this would be &s;uch an economy, as the living on a prin|cipal &s;um, without making it purcha&s;e inter|e&s;t.</P>
<P>TIME is one of the mo&s;t precious jewels which we po&s;&s;e&s;s; but its true value is &s;el|dom known till it is near a clo&s;e, and when it is not in our power to redeem it. The right improvement of time is of the greate&s;t con&s;equence to mankind. The pre&s;ent mo|ment is only ours. The pre&s;ent moment calls for di&s;patch; and, if neglected, it is a great chance if ever we get another oppor|tunity. Today we live, tomorrow we may die. Be&s;ide, we have a great work to do, and an appointed time in which it mu&s;t be done.

The uncertainty of this time adds much to its brevity; the velocity of it urges its im|provement the more. SENECA ob&s;erves, We all complain of the &s;hortne&s;s of time, but &s;pend it in &s;uch a manner, as if we had too much.</P>
<P>THE time we live ought not to be comput|ed to by the number of years, but by the u&s;e which has been made of it: It is not the ex|tent of ground, but the yearly rent which gives the value to the e&s;tate. Wretched and thoughtle&s;s creatures! in the only place where covetou&s;ne&s;s were a virtue, we turn prodigals! nothing lies upon our hands with &s;uch unea&s;ine&s;s, nor has there been &s;o many devices for any one thing, as to make time glide away imperceptibly and to no purpo&s;e. A &s;hilling &s;hall be hoarded up with care whil&s;t that which is above the price of an e&s;tate, is flung away with di&s;regard and contempt.</P>
