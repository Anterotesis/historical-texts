<HEAD>AN <HI>ADDRESS, &amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THAT public &s;ervants, my fellow-citizens, owe tho&s;e who employ them an exact account of whatever they do in di&s;charge of their tru&s;t, has always appear|ed to me a truth equally clear and important. This tru&s;t, from its very nature and its objects, mu&s;t be exerci&s;ed according <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the di&s;cretion of the agent. He is appointed for that very pur|po&s;e; appointed to enquire, gain information, deliberate, and decide on public mea&s;ures, according to what he may con&s;ider as the be&s;t intere&s;t of his con&s;tituents and the community. But tho' they give him the power of acting for them, they retain the right of judging whether he has exerted that power with pru|dence and fidelity; of continuing or withdrawing their confi|dence, as he may appear to have merited approbation or become ju&s;tly liable to cen&s;ure.</P>
<P>It is therefore the duty of every repre&s;entative to give his con&s;tituents a faithful account not only of what he has done up|on every important occa&s;ion, but of the rea&s;ons and motives which have influenced his conduct, that they may be enabled to judge whether that conduct and tho&s;e motives are &s;uch as they ought to approve, and to decide at a future election, whether they ought to continue or alter their choice.</P>
<P>Under the influence of this per&s;ua&s;ion, fellow-citizens, I have thought it incumbent on me to addre&s;s you on the &s;ubject of the treaty with Great-Britain&mdash;a &s;ubject which has produced a &s;tronger and a more univer&s;al impre&s;&s;ion on the public mind than any that has occurred &s;ince I received your appointment, to tell you the means I have u&s;ed to form a right judgment, the deci&s;ion I have at length made, and the rea&s;ons on which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> founded.</P>

<P>But, fellow-citizens, let me a&s;k you, and let me appeal to your calm di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate judgment for an an&s;wer, let me a&s;k you can the&s;e frightful events, the&s;e de&s;tructive con&s;equences, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> ju&s;tly apprehended from a treaty the whole commercial part o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> which is to expire at the end of twelve years, and may be ter|minated by our&s;elves within two years after the clo&s;e of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ent war?

I confe&s;s I cannot conceive it.</P>
<P>Let me further a&s;k you, fellow citizens, what rea&s;ons there are to believe that Mr. Jay would conclude, major Pinckney approve, two thirds of the Senate &s;anction, and the Pre&s;ident finally ratify a treaty "degrading to the national honour, and dangerous to the political exi&s;tence of the United States,"&mdash;a treaty containing "a pro&s;titution of their &s;overeignty, and a wanton &s;acrifice of their rights."&mdash;a treaty which "admits ano|ther government to controul the legi&s;lative functions of the Union," "pro&s;titutes the deare&s;t rights of freemen, and lays them pro&s;trate at the feet of royalty?"</P>
<P>Mr. Jay had a reputation to &s;upport, a reputation gained by a long and active public life; would he bla&s;t it at once? He has a family growing up around him: would he throw a gloom

over all their opening pro&s;pects, and nip the bud of their pro&s;|perity by an act which mu&s;t involve him&s;elf and them in one common di&s;grace? He held a di&s;tingui&s;hed office from which the voice of his country might remove him; would he rai&s;e the voice of that country again&s;t him, by "pro&s;tituting its &s;ove|reignty, and making a wanton &s;acrifice of its rights?" At the time when he agreed to this treaty, at the time when he di&s;patch|ed it to the United States, at the time when, without unfore&s;een and accidental delays, it mu&s;t have arrived and been made pub|lic, at that time he was a candidate for an high office in his own State, to which he could be rai&s;ed only by the approbation of his fellow citizens at large; would he en&s;ure their di&s;appro|bation by betraying their deare&s;t intere&s;ts? He was oppo&s;ed by a numerous and powerful party, by a popular and re&s;pectable competitor; would he furni&s;h this oppo&s;ition with irre&s;i&s;table arms again&s;t him&s;elf, by an act which mu&s;t have drawn on him the public execration? He is &s;aid to be a candidate for the highe&s;t tru&s;t his country can be&s;tow, a candidate in oppo&s;ition to men di&s;tingui&s;hed throughout Europe as well as America, for their talents and their virtues: would he forever bla&s;t whatever pro&s;pects he may have by agreeing to "admit another govern|ment to controul the legi&s;lative functions of his country?" No, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> citizens! The &s;tations which Mr. Jay has filled, the long period for which he has enjoyed a &s;potle&s;s reputation and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;|ed the confidence of his country, argue at lea&s;t, a common por|tion of talents and integrity; and a man mu&s;t be depraved and fooli&s;h to an unu&s;ual degree, who, &s;ituated as Mr. Jay was, could con&s;ent to &s;o attrocious an act as the treaty is repre&s;ent|ed; could con&s;ent to "degrade the national honour, endanger the political exi&s;tence, and de&s;troy the agricultural, manufac|turing, commercial, and &s;hipping intere&s;ts" of his country: fooli&s;h if he could con&s;ent to it without &s;eeing its tendency, and both fooli&s;h and depraved if he &s;aw it and yet con&s;ented.</P>
<P>But if Mr. Jay was corrupted by the Briti&s;h court, as a per|&s;on in Charle&s;ton has thought proper to in&s;inuate;<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Mr. Charles Pinckney's &s;peech.

"an ea&s;y and ready conce&s;&s;ion to the Briti&s;h of every privilege they could think of in&s;erting,"<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE> If he was willing to make "an infamous and degrading &s;urrender of the rights and cha|racter of his country," and has "attempted to impo&s;e ignomini|ous &s;hackles"<NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE> upon it: If we &s;hould believe all this of Mr. Jay upon the a&s;&s;ertion of per&s;ons, who, to &s;ay the lea&s;t of them, have given no greater proofs than he has of ability or virtue, what &s;hall we &s;ay of major Pinckney? Are we to include him in this charge of folly and wickedne&s;s? He was on the &s;pot during the whole negociation, and for many months preceding it; he had frequently communicated with the Briti&s;h court on the &s;ubject, he knew their jealou&s;y, haughtine&s;s, and ob&s;tinacy; he was con&s;ulted by Mr. Jay in every &s;tage of the negociation, and gave his mo&s;t decided approbation of the treaty. In a let|ter to the Secretary of State dated, London, Nov. 16th 1794, he &s;ays, "Mr. Jay communicated freely with me upon this &s;ub|ject during the cour&s;e of the negociation, and I have witne&s;&s;ed the great difficulties which have occurred in adju&s;ting &s;everal of the articles. Although &s;ome points might have been arrang<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> more benefically for us <HI>if the treaty had been dictated entire<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> by the United States,</HI> yet when it is con&s;idered as <HI>a compo&s;ition of differences where mutual complaints had rendered mutual conce&s;&s;ions nece&s;&s;ary</HI> to e&s;tabli&s;h a good under&s;tanding, I think it may fairly be &s;aid that as little has been conceded by Mr. Jay, and as much obtained for the United States, as all circum|&s;tances con&s;idered, could be expected. The bu&s;ine&s;s upon the whole has been concluded more beneficially for us, than I had any hope we could obtain by negociation &s;ix months ago, and in my opinion places us in a more advantageous &s;ituation than we &s;hould have been by becoming parties to the war." This opinion, fellow citizens, I confe&s;s had great weight with me. You all know major Pinckney, you know his mode&s;t worth, his retiring virtue, his di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s, his una&s;&s;uming firmne&s;s of character, his &s;olid judgment, his con&s;cientious attention to the di&s;charge of every public and private duty. You have &s;een him act in all the various &s;tations of civil life, and many of you have &s;een him bleed at your &s;ides in defence of the rights and liberties of America. Can you conceive that he has given his &s;anction to an in&s;trument by which tho&s;e rights and liberties are to be laid pro&s;trate at the feet of royalty; by which our na|tional honour is to be degraded, our independence de&s;troyed; our public pro&s;perity ruined or endangered, and the legi&s;lative functions of our country &s;ubjected to the controul of a foreign government? Could he be &s;o deceived in the nature of that in|&s;trument
<PB N="8" REF="028802_0007_0FDD4D79B2C0AD00">
as to think it advantageous to America, if it were in f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">t &s;ubver&s;ive of our rights, liberties, con&s;titution, and happi|ne&s;s?</P>
<P>But if Mr. Jay and major Pinckney be intitled to no con|fidence, if we conclude that they were impo&s;ed on or corrupted, is no regard due to the opinion of two thirds of the Senate, act|ing on oath and in di&s;charge of the high tru&s;t which their fellow citizens have repo&s;ed in them? The&s;e men have been &s;elected from various parts of the Union for tho&s;e qualities which enti|tle citizens in a free government, to public confidence. Their intere&s;ts are involved with the intere&s;ts of the community. Their promotion depends on the approbation of their fellow ci|tizens. Many of them are old and tried &s;ervants who have grown grey in the public councils of their country, and who&s;e wi&s;dom and integrity have hitherto been highly valued. I know many of them per&s;onally, and I know no men of more accu|rate or exten&s;ive information, than are to be found among them, no men more re&s;pectable for their talents or their virtues. Why &s;hould &s;uch men betray their tru&s;t? What temptation have they to prove unfaithful to a country who&s;e confidence they po&s;&s;e&s;s? They enjoyed the be&s;t means of information; they po&s;&s;e&s;s a good capacity of judging; they be&s;towed a long and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> con&s;iderations on the &s;ubject, and why &s;hould <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> con|clude that they have decided unwi&s;ely? Have we better means of information? Have we more wi&s;dom than they? Or have we given the bu&s;ine&s;s a more mature, a more attentive inve&s;ti|gation? Have we given more proofs than they of wi&s;dom and integrity, that we &s;hould har&s;hly and po&s;itively pronounce their act to be "a pro&s;titution of the deare&s;t rights of their country at the feet of royalty?"</P>
<P>But if the perfidy or folly of two thirds of the Senate have been added to that of Mr. Jay and major Pinckney, can we de|rive no &s;ecurity from the integrity of Gen. Wa&s;hington; from his prudence, his long tried patrioti&s;m, his &s;ound under&s;tanding, his cautious deliberating character, from his exten&s;ive means of information, from the long con&s;ideration which his &s;ituation has enabled him to be&s;tow on this &s;ubject? The&s;e qualities were once thought to intitle him to public confidence; how has this title been forfeited? Has it been by the firmne&s;s and wi&s;dom with which, a thing unexampled in other countries and other times, he &s;uppre&s;&s;ed a formidable in&s;urrection without &s;hedding one drop of blood? Has it been by the &s;ingular mixture of prudence and fortitude wherewith he has pre&s;erved to this young and ri&s;ing country all the ble&s;&s;ings of peace and unexampled pro&s;perity, amid&s;t the de&s;tructive fury of that tempe&s;t by which Europe and the We&s;t-Indies have been afflicted and torn? Is
<PB N="9" REF="028802_0008_0FDD4D9AC4155960">
it becau&s;e we have dwelt &s;afely under his admini&s;tration, and there have been none to make us afraid? Is it becau&s;e our cre|dit has been re&s;tored, our agriculture doubled, our commerce, manufactures, and &s;hipping encrea&s;ed nearly three-fold during the &s;hort period for which he has pre&s;ided over our government, that we ought now to withdraw from him our confidence; now to &s;uppo&s;e that he would ratify a treaty by which "our deare&s;t rights would be laid pro&s;trate at the feet of royalty"? Is it the magnanimity wherewith he was foremo&s;t in acknowledging the French Republic,<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">This is a fact. Our government was the fir&s;t to ac|knowledge the French Republic.</NOTE> while every power in Europe was leagued again&s;t it, or &s;tood aloof, from which we are to conclude that he would enter into a compact "ho&s;tile and ungrateful to France"?</P>
<P>If mi&s;chiefs of this kind really lurked in this treaty, is it con|ceivable that they could e&s;cape the Pre&s;ident's knowledge and attention? He has hitherto been con&s;idered as prudent and cautions. He had the be&s;t po&s;&s;ible means of information on this &s;ubject. He was apprized of every &s;tep that was taken, knew the whole cour&s;e of the negociation, and under&s;tood well the &s;ub&s;tance of the treaty before it was concluded. He <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the in&s;trument in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion from the time of its arrival in this country, early in March, until he finally ratified it &s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> in July. During this whole period it was under his con|&s;ideration, aided by the advice of every man in the United States whom he thought it nece&s;&s;ary to con&s;ult, furni&s;hed with all the information, from every quarter, that was requi&s;ite for enlightening and guiding his own under&s;tanding, he at length decided. And is no re&s;pect due to &s;uch a deci&s;ion? I confe&s;s, fellow citizens, I cannot think &s;o. Were I di&s;po&s;ed to differ from it, I &s;hould &s;till imagine that with &s;uch an authority op|po&s;ed to me, I might probably be in the wrong. I &s;hould hold it nece&s;&s;ary, before I pronounced po&s;itively that this deci&s;ion was wicked or fooli&s;h, to a&s;k my&s;elf whether I had given more evidences of wi&s;dom, virtue, and patrioti&s;m than General Wa&s;h|ington; whether I had pa&s;&s;ed through more or &s;everer trials; whether I had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed more ample means of information on this &s;ubject than he, or be&s;towed on it a longer, a more <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> examination? And finally, whether I ought, on a &s;hort inve&s;ti|gation of my own, or a &s;till &s;horter one of others, to reject this deci&s;ion, &s;upported by the talents and knowledge of two thirds of the Senate, by tho&s;e qualities of Mr. Jay which have gained him &s;uch high and repeated te&s;timonies of public confidence,
<PB N="10" REF="028802_0009_0FDD4D7B5E07D5F0">
and by the prudence, the &s;ound di&s;cretion, the knowledge, and the tried patrioti&s;m of major Pinckney?</P>
<P>The&s;e con&s;iderations inclined me to think favourably of the treaty before I had given it that attentive and thorough con&s;i|deration which ought to precede every deci&s;ion on important public mea&s;ures. But I knew that it was my duty to how im|plicitly to no authority, however weighty, but to judge and act for my&s;elf. I knew that you had &s;ent me to form opinions of my own, not to adopt tho&s;e of other per&s;ons, however re&s;pecta|ble. I therefore re&s;olved to &s;pare no pains for under&s;tanding the &s;ubject, and forming a right judgment about it. For this pur|po&s;e I conver&s;ed, as far as I had opportunity, both with the friends of the treaty, and its oppo&s;ers. I carefully weighed all their objections. I read attentively every thing that was writ|ten in favour of it and again&s;t it. I gained all the information in my power, and from the mo&s;t re&s;pectable &s;ources, re&s;pecting tho&s;e branches of our commerce which it affects. I took the trea|ty it&s;elf with me on my journey, as well as the publications re|&s;pecting it, which from time to time appeared. I faithfully and repeatedly &s;tudied it, recurred to it on every occa&s;ion, and carefully compared it with our other treaties, with the laws of nations, and with our own con&s;titution.</P>
<P>From the time when the treaty was publi&s;hed, till the pre&s;ent moment, more than five months, this has been my chief occu|pation.</P>
<P>The re&s;ult, fellow citizens, of this examination, which I am hold to declare has been a fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">thful, a laborious, and an impar|tial one, is a firm and complete per&s;ua&s;ion that the treaty, &s;itu|ated as we were, was proper and expedient; that, to u&s;e the words of major Pinckney, "as little has been conceded by the United States, and as much gained for them as, all circum&s;tan|ces con&s;idered, could be expected: That the bu&s;ine&s;s has been concluded more beneficially for us than there was rea&s;on to hope could be obtained by negociation, &s;ome months before; and that it places us in a more advantageous &s;ituation than we &s;hould have been in by becoming parties to the war."</P>
<P>The ca&s;e between us and Great Britain, at the time when Mr. Jay was &s;ent, &s;tood thus:</P>
<P>We charged Great Britain with having, greatly to our de|triment, retained the we&s;tern po&s;ts which &s;he was bound by the treaty of peace to give up; with having carried away from New York, at the evacuation of it, a great number of negroes, the property of American citizens, contrary to the expre&s;s &s;ti|pulations of that treaty; and with having given orders, during the pre&s;ent war, for the capture of a great number of our ve&s;|&s;els, contrary to the law of nations and the rights of neutrality.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="028802_0010_0FDD4D9C2FDB6760">Great Britain, on her part, alledged, that we had committed the fir&s;t infraction of the treaty of peace, by permitting legal impediments to the recovery of Briti&s;h debts, contrary to the fourth article, and that &s;he retained the po&s;ts as a pledge for our performance of that article; &s;he denied that the negroes car|ried away from New-York were American property at the time of &s;igning the treaty, having been made lawful prize by her ar|my during the war. And as to the captures made on us in the pre&s;ent war, &s;he pretended that they were authorized by the law of nations.</P>
<P>In this &s;tate of things there were but three po&s;&s;ible cour&s;es for us to take. Fir&s;t, To &s;ubmit quietly to the continuation and repetition of the injuries. Secondly, To pur&s;ue redre&s;s by mea&s;ures of compul&s;ion: Or thirdly, To &s;eek it by mea&s;ures of negociation.</P>
<P>To remain as we were, to &s;it down quietly under the injuries of which we complained, would have been not only da&s;tardly and di&s;honourable, but unwi&s;e in the extreme; for experience proves, that among nations as well as individuals, to &s;ubmit tamely to injuries is to invite a repetition of them; and our government mu&s;t have relinqui&s;hed all claim to the re&s;pect of foreigners and the confidence of its own citizens, had it &s;uffer|ed important parts of our territory to be withheld, and exten&s;ive depredations to be made on our property, without taking any &s;teps to a&s;&s;ert and vindicate its rights. To &s;eek effectual and honourable redre&s;s then, in &s;ome mode or other, was clearly in|di&s;pen&s;able. The choice was between mea&s;ures of compul&s;ion and mea&s;ures of negociation.</P>
<P>Compul&s;ory mea&s;ures were of four kinds: Fir&s;t, war&mdash;&s;e|condly, commercial re&s;trictions&mdash;thirdly, prohibition of inter|cour&s;e&mdash;and fourthly, &s;eque&s;tration of debts and &s;tock in our banks and funds.</P>
<P>War had but few open advocates, and probably not a very great number of &s;ecret ones. The public re&s;entment was at one period inflamed to &s;uch a degree by the depredations of the Briti&s;h that great numbers felt &s;trongly di&s;po&s;ed to the mo&s;t ho&s;tile mea&s;ures; but when they reflected on the &s;tate of total un-preparation in which we were, without a frigate at &s;ea, or a regiment on foot, more than was nece&s;&s;ary for the Indian war, our harbours unfortified, our ar&s;enals and magazines unfurni&s;h|ed, and five hundred thou&s;and tons of &s;hipping afloat with car|goes of immen&s;e value: when they reflected on the uncertain event of war, and the certain mi&s;chiefs by which it is attended; the immen&s;e expence, the va&s;t accummulation of debt, the in|crea&s;e of taxation, the de&s;truction of property, the &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of indu&s;try, the lo&s;s of revenue, and the total derangement of
<PB N="12" REF="028802_0011_0FDD4D7EEFF757B8">
our finances; when they maturely weighed all the&s;e con&s;idera|tions, they regarded war as the greate&s;t of evils, to be &s;ubmit|ted to only in the la&s;t re&s;ort, only when every other expedient had be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n fairly tried without &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>The ca&s;e, however, was different with re&s;pect to commercial re&s;trictions. They found &s;upport in the fir&s;t talents and repu|tation of our country, and became a favorite object with very con&s;iderable numbers. It was conceived that by laying heavy burdens on the Briti&s;h commerce, on their &s;hipping in our ports and their commodities in our country, their government might be brought to a temper more amicable or more ju&s;t towards us, might be compelled to make us reparation for the pa&s;t, and to refrain from future injuries. But it was ob&s;erved, on the other &s;ide, that the&s;e re&s;trictions would probably widen the breach be|tween us and Britain in&s;tead of clo&s;ing it; would irritate ra|ther than heal the wound; would provoke them to further acts of inju&s;tice, not entice them to a conduct more equitable and friendly: that the re&s;trictions would be hurtful to our&s;elves as well as the Briti&s;h, and perhaps in an equal, or even a greater degree; that they would probably lay on our commerce coun|ter re&s;trictions, whereby we &s;hould &s;oon be engaged in a war of commercial re&s;trictions with them, in which it might happen that they would hold out longe&s;t. In fine, it was con&s;idered, that this mode of compul&s;ion would be attended by great and certain inconveniences, that its &s;ucce&s;s would be very doubt|ful, and that, if un&s;ucce&s;sful, it could not fail to prove highly mi&s;chievous.&mdash;The plan of commercial re&s;trictions was there|fore rejected.</P>
<P>It was next propo&s;ed to &s;u&s;pend all commercial intercour&s;e with Great Britain, to receive none of her commodities in our ports, and to &s;end her none of our own. The &s;upporters of this plan &s;uppo&s;ed our commerce to be of &s;uch importance to Great-Britain, that &s;ooner than lo&s;e it, even for a time, &s;he would come to our own terms. But here again it was objected, that the inconveniences of this mea&s;ure were great and certain, its &s;ucce&s;s doubtful; that it would injure us extremely, as well as the Briti&s;h; that they could, and in all probability would, do without our commerce quite as long as we &s;hould find it conve|nient to do without theirs; and that if their government &s;hould happen to be ob&s;tinate, an event extremely probable, con&s;ider|ing its arrogance and pride, we &s;hould be obliged at la&s;t to give up the mea&s;ure, and recur to other means, after having u&s;ele&s;sly embarra&s;&s;ed our trade and deranged one of its mo&s;t con&s;idera|ble branches.</P>
<P>The&s;e propo&s;itions therefore of a commercial war, of re&s;tric|tions and prohibitions as means of compul&s;ion, were rejected, and, as it appears to me, upon unan&s;werable rea&s;ons.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="028802_0012_0FDD4D9DDC779900">The la&s;t compul&s;ory expedient propo&s;ed was &s;eque&s;tration. Debts to a very great amount are known to be due in our coun|try to the &s;ubjects of Great Britain; and they are &s;uppo&s;ed al&s;o to po&s;&s;e&s;s property to a con&s;iderable extent in our banks and public funds. It was &s;uppo&s;ed that by &s;eizing on the&s;e debts and this property, and &s;ubjecting them to &s;eque&s;tration, we might &s;o embarra&s;s the Briti&s;h government as &s;peedily to bring it to terms; or at any rate, that the &s;eque&s;tered effects would &s;erve as a fund out of which our lo&s;&s;es by her violent acts might be in|demnified.</P>
<P>But it was objected, in the fir&s;t place, that to infringe the &s;e|curity of private property would be a very unwi&s;e mea&s;ure, as it re&s;pected our&s;elves: that it would greatly le&s;&s;en the confi|dence repo&s;ed at pre&s;ent by foreigners in the good faith of our government; prevent the exten&s;ion, if not put an end to the exi&s;tence, of that commercial credit by which the want of capi|tal in this young country, has hitherto been &s;upplied, and &s;uch immen&s;e advantages given to our commerce, our agriculture, and our infant manufactures; and that in proportion as debts were le&s;s &s;ecure, all that we borrowed or bought on credit mu&s;t be borrowed at an higher intere&s;t or bought at a greater price, the injuries ari&s;ing from which would &s;oon be much greater than tho&s;e for which the&s;e mea&s;ures were intended as a remedy.</P>
<P>It was urged, in the &s;econd place, that &s;o violent a mea&s;ure as the &s;eque&s;tration of debts and property in funds, could hardly fail to be immediately introductive of an open rupture; that we could hardly expect the Briti&s;h government to &s;ubmit to it without reprizals; and as we have little or no property of that kind in their reach, their mode of repri&s;als would probably be to i&s;&s;ue lettres of marque and privateer commi&s;&s;ions again&s;t our commerce; in which ca&s;e we mu&s;t either negociate, wherefore our &s;ituation would be far more unfavourable than before, or have recour&s;e to lettres of marque and privateers on our &s;ide, and thus be immediately involved in a war, for which we were totally unprepared, and which could not fail to he productive of the greate&s;t injury, be&s;ide being mo&s;t uncertain in its event. This mea&s;ure al&s;o was therefore given up; and it was re&s;olved to make an effort for obtaining redre&s;s by means of negociation, and, in the mean time, to prepare vigorou&s;ly for the wor&s;t, in order that, if this effort &s;hould fail, we might be in a condition to adopt and pur&s;ue, with effect, &s;uch mea&s;ures of compul&s;ion as the circum&s;tances of the ca&s;e might render unavoidable. By this expedient it was conceived that we &s;hould not only gain time for preparation, which was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, but give our|&s;elves the opportunity of profiting by that favourable change of circum&s;tances in Europe which the enthu&s;ia&s;tic valour of the

French, their wife mea&s;ures, and unheard of exertions, joined to the divi&s;ions and folly con&s;picuous in the councils of their enemies, rendered extremely probable.</P>
<P>This &s;y&s;tem of conduct being agreed on, it being re&s;olved to adopt mea&s;ures of negociation in the fir&s;t place, and re&s;erve mea&s;ures of compul&s;ion for the la&s;t re&s;ort, the next que&s;tion was as to the mode of negociating. It was thought that an emba&s;&s;y extraordinary was preferable, that being the cu&s;tomary mode in ca&s;es of unu&s;ual importance, and carrying with it &s;tronger indications of a determina<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ion on the part of our government, to pur&s;ue its object with the utmo&s;t firmne&s;s and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">. Mr. Jay, at that time chief ju&s;tice of the United States, was nominated by the Pre&s;ident for this purpo&s;e, and approved by the Senate.</P>
<P>Objections both per&s;onal and con&s;titutional, have been made to Mr. Jay. He has been &s;aid to be prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in favour of Britain, and an avowed e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">y to France. If this had been true it would &s;urely have been a &s;ufficient rea&s;on for rejecting him; but it is not true. I can contradict it, and do &s;o, on my own knowledge. I have heard Mr. Jay expre&s;s in public and pri|vate, and tho&s;e who have been much more and much longer ac|quainted with him, a&s;&s;ure me that he always has expre&s;&s;ed the ut|mo&s;t plea&s;ure in the French revolution, and the warme&s;t wi&s;hes for its &s;ucce&s;s, the greate&s;t di&s;like of the former government, and &s;entiments of the highe&s;t e&s;teem and regard for the nation. Mr. Jay indeed thought that the conduct of a late French mini&s;ter was exceedingly improper, that he was endeavouring to gain and undue influence over the government, and involve the country in confu&s;ion: but Mr. Jeffer&s;on al&s;o thought &s;o, as his letter on that &s;ubject to our mini&s;ter at Paris fully proves, and Mr. Jef|fer&s;on was never thought to hate the French, though like Mr. Jay and numberle&s;s others of our be&s;t and wi&s;e&s;t citizens, he thought that our government ought not to be &s;ubject to the con|troul, or in&s;ults of their mini&s;ter. So Mr. Jay has given it as his opinion, as chief ju&s;tice of the United States, that intere&s;t ought to be paid on Briti&s;h debts during the war. This is not my opinion, but I know that it is the opinion of &s;everal other judges of the &s;upreme court, if not all, and of a great number of our &s;ounde&s;t and mo&s;t eminent lawyers. Was it ever heard before that becau&s;e a judge decided again&s;t one party and in favour of the other, he was an enemy to the former or a friend to the latter? Mr. Jay, as &s;ecretary for foreign affairs, gave it as his opinion, it is &s;aid, that we had made infractions of the treaty as well as Great Britain. The fact is notoriou&s;ly &s;o. We agreed not to impede the recovery of ju&s;t debts, and we did im|pede it in various inhances. Such are the proofs of Mr. Jay's hatred to France and partiality to Great Britain. But if he
<PB N="15" REF="028802_0014_0FDD4DA2F0849BC8">
were ever &s;o partial to one and inimical to the other, what has that to do with the treaty? Mu&s;t it &s;tand or fall by its own merits or demerits, or by tho&s;e of the negociator?</P>
<P>It is al&s;o &s;aid that it was contrary to the con&s;titution to be|&s;tow this appointment on Mr. Jay, while chief ju&s;tice of the United States. If the Pre&s;ident in this in&s;tance wilfully in|fringed the con&s;titution, let tho&s;e who think &s;o impeach him. If I can be convinced of it, I, for one, will not only vote for the impeachment, but &s;upport it with all my might. For, con|&s;idering that the con&s;titution is the charter of our liberties, and the guarantee of them to our po&s;terity, I think the wilful in|fringement of it an offence which no con&s;ideration &s;hould in|duce us to pardon or overlook. If it were only an error in his judgment, and he too is liable to error, though perhaps not more &s;o than tho&s;e who accu&s;e him, the error &s;hould have been corrected, and all legal and proper means u&s;ed for that purpo&s;e. But in the mean time, what has the merit or demerit of the trea|ty to do with the error o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the offence? The que&s;tion is, whe|ther the treaty be a proper, a beneficial one; not whether the mini&s;ter who negociated it, were con&s;titutionally appointed. If the mini&s;ter were weak, ignorant or wicked, that would be a good rea&s;on for &s;u&s;pecting the treaty to be a bad one: but can his talents for negociation, or his integrity, be le&s;&s;ened or in|crea&s;ed by the con&s;titutionality or uncon&s;titutionality of his ap|pointment? But how does it appear that Mr. Jay's appoint|ment was uncon&s;titutional? The con&s;titution &s;ays, that the le|gi&s;lative, executive, and judicial powers &s;hall be di&s;tinct and &s;eparate. But is negociating a treaty a legi&s;lative or an execu|tive act? So far from it, that it is not, in the eye of the law or the con&s;titution, an act of any kind. To make a treaty is partly an executive, partly a legi&s;lative act; but the mini&s;ter does not make it any more than a lawyer makes a will or a deed which he is employed to draw up. It derives its legal exi&s;tence and efficacy not from the act of the mini&s;ter who negociates and &s;igns it, but from that of the Pre&s;ident and Senate, who ratify it. They make the treaty, and the negociator is only an in&s;tru|ment in their hands for that purpo&s;e; as much an in&s;trument a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the clerk who is employed to engro&s;s, or the me&s;&s;enger who carries it. But the &s;ame per&s;on, it is &s;aid, cannot perform two different functions at once. How does this appear? The con|&s;titution &s;ays no &s;uch thing. It will &s;eldom be po&s;&s;ible, and more &s;eldom will it be expedient, for the &s;ame per&s;on to &s;u&s;tain two functions at one time; but the con&s;titution does not forbid it, when po&s;&s;ible and expedient; and of this po&s;&s;ibility and ex|pediency, the Pre&s;ident and Senate, in whom re&s;ts the power of appointment, are to judge. It is further contended, that a
<PB N="16" REF="028802_0015_0FDD4D8284880CA8">
judge will have an improper bias, in favour of a treaty which he has negociated, which he has been concerned in making; and &s;hould therefore never be employed for that purpo&s;e. It would be ju&s;t as wi&s;e to &s;ay, that no per&s;on who had negociated a trea|ty, who had been a member of Congre&s;s, or of any State Le|gi&s;lature, could ever after be made a judge; becau&s;e in all tho&s;e ca&s;es he would be called upon to expound and enforce laws which he had been concerned in making. At this rate, be|fore the Pre&s;ident can place a man of the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed ta|lents on the federal bench, he mu&s;t enquire, whether the candi|date has ever been thought worthy of a &s;eat in the Legi&s;lature of his own &s;tate, and if he has, reject him. He will probably find but few who po&s;&s;e&s;s this nece&s;&s;ary qualification; of which I am &s;ure that not one of the pre&s;ent judges can boa&s;t. They have all been members of their &s;tate legi&s;latures, and mo&s;t of them members of Congre&s;s. One of them was taken from the &s;enate to be made a judge. I would a&s;k whether it would be uncon&s;titutional for the Pre&s;ident to call for the advice of the judges about &s;ome executive act, the ratification of a treaty for in&s;tance? And yet a judge who advi&s;es a treaty may have as &s;trong a bias in favour of it, as one who negociates it; and one ca&s;e is ju&s;t as much a blending of the executive and judicial de|partments <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s the other. Would it be uncon&s;titution <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the Pre&s;ident if he were going on a military expedition during the rece&s;s of Congre&s;s, to make a member of either hou&s;e his aid|de-camp? Yet this would be employing a member of the legi&s;|lative body in functions appertaining to the executive depart|ment.</P>
<P>For the&s;e rea&s;ons, fellow-citizens, it appeared to me that Mr. Jay's appointment could not be ju&s;tly con&s;idered as uncon&s;titu|tional, or improper; and that if it were both the one and the other, &s;till this would not affect the merits of the treaty; from an attentive and impartial examination of which, a correct judg|ment can alone be formed.</P>
<P>Among the numerous objections which have been made to the treaty it&s;elf, none appear to have produced a &s;tronger impre&s;&s;ion on the public mind, than its giving up the claim for negroes car|ried away at the end of the war, and its making no provi&s;ion a|gain&s;t the impre&s;&s;ing of American &s;eamen into the Briti&s;h na|val &s;ervice.</P>
<P>The la&s;t of the&s;e objection &s;eems to me to ari&s;e from an over|fight; or from very great inattention to the in&s;trument. The nineteenth article provides, that "for the &s;ecurity of the re&s;pec|tive &s;ubjects and citizens of the contracting parties, <HI>and to pre|vent their &s;uffering injuries by the men of war or privateers of either party,</HI> all <HI>commanders of &s;hips of war,</HI> privateers, and
<PB N="17" REF="028802_0016_0FDD4DA3E9A86DC0">
all others the &s;aid &s;ubjects and citizens, &s;hall forbear doing any damage to tho&s;e of the other party, or committing any outrage again&s;t them." Does not this amount to a complete prohibition again&s;t the impre&s;&s;ing of American &s;eamen? For what greater injury or outrage can be done to a man than to &s;eize him by force, and carry him to &s;erve on board a &s;hip of war? Be&s;ide even this was unnece&s;&s;ary; for to impre&s;s our &s;eamen is an illegal act, expre&s;sly contrary to the law of nations; as much &s;o as to take our &s;hips, invade our territory, or burn our towns; and it would have been ju&s;t as rea&s;onable to require a &s;tipulation again&s;t the&s;e or any other acts of ho&s;tility. It would be like in&s;i&s;ting on a neighbour to give bond and &s;ecurity that he would not rob us or burn our hou&s;es. It will often be difficult to di&s;tingui&s;h American from Briti&s;h &s;eamen, and mi&s;takes no doubt will &s;ometimes be committed. The Briti&s;h claim a right to impre&s;s their own &s;eamen wherever they find them; there are great numbers of them on board of our &s;hips, where they get better wages than in their own. In taking them, American citizens will often be taken by mi&s;take, and &s;ometimes by de&s;ign; for we can never be perfectly guarded again&s;t in&s;olence and vio|lence; but this would al&s;o happen if a thou&s;and treaties were made. The treaty on &s;ome occa&s;ions would, thro' mi&s;take or de&s;ign, be di&s;regarded, as the law of nations now is. Our go|vernment mu&s;t pa&s;s a law to furni&s;h its citizens with proper cer|tificates, and if tho&s;e who have them are impre&s;&s;ed, it mu&s;t in|terfere efficaciou&s;ly in their behalf, and get them relea&s;ed.</P>
<P>On the &s;ubject of the negroes, there has been much mi&s;con|ception. The number taken away, as far as it can be a&s;cer|tained, does not exceed three thou&s;and, of the&s;e one thou&s;and were free, or belonged to per&s;ons who went off with the Briti&s;h. Two thou&s;and con&s;equently is the whole number for which pay|ment could be demanded. A very great number died, and a &s;till greater perhaps was &s;ent off to the We&s;t-Indies during the war; but the treaty of peace does not comprehend the&s;e. Its words are "his Britanic maje&s;ty &s;hall, with all convenient &s;peed, and without cau&s;ing any de&s;truction, or carrying away any negroes, or other property of the American inhabitants, withdraw all his armies, &amp;c. This can relate only to negroes to be carried away at the evacuation, by Briti&s;h authority, and the number of the&s;e does not exceed two thou&s;and. Stating the&s;e two thou&s;and at two hundred dollars each, the whole a|mount is four hundred thou&s;and dollars. Is this a &s;um for two countries to quarrel about? A war of three months would co&s;t five times as much. The Briti&s;h government ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed to give up the point. They were pre&s;&s;ed again and again, and &s;till adhered to it with inflexible ob&s;tinacy. They contended,
<PB N="18" REF="028802_0017_0FDD4D85CECBB840">
that we had no right to payment for the&s;e negroes; that the trea|ty of peace meane only &s;uch negroes as were American proper|ty at the time of the evacuation; and that they having been ta|ken in war, had by the laws of war become booty and were no longer American property, any more than hor&s;es, cattle, or any thing el&s;e which had been taken. Whether they were in the right, or we, is not ea&s;y or nece&s;&s;ary to decide. They in&s;i&s;ted on it, and the que&s;tion was whether we would give it up, or break off the negociation and come to an open quarrel with them. Would it have been wi&s;e to do &s;o? I think not. I think it was much better to give up the four hundred thou&s;and dollars; and for our government to pay it, if nece&s;&s;ary to the &s;ufferers. To act otherwi&s;e would, in my opinion, have been like two men going to law about the value of a cow, and expend|ing an hundred pounds a piece in the di&s;pute. Nations as well as individuals, mu&s;t &s;ometimes make conce&s;&s;ions if they wi&s;h to live in peace; and for each party to in&s;i&s;t ob&s;tinately on all that he thinks him&s;elf intitled to, would prevent the po&s;&s;ibility of terminating differences in an amicable manner.</P>
<P>Another objection of great force again&s;t the treaty is, that it is ho&s;tile towards France.</P>
<P>But wherein does this ho&s;tility con&s;i&s;t? All the rights of France under her treaties with us are expre&s;sly &s;aved&punc; for in the twenty fifth article, it is &s;tipulated that "nothing in this treaty contained &s;hall, however, be con&s;trued or operate, con|trary to former and exi&s;ting public treaties with other &s;ove|reigns or &s;tates." The&s;e are the words. How then can any of the rights of France be infringed? The treaty, it is &s;aid, will prove di&s;advantageous to the intere&s;ts of France. But, fel|low citizens, what does this amount to? It amounts, as I think, to &s;aying, that the government of America is not to be guided by the intere&s;ts of its own citizens, but by tho&s;e of its allies. We have nothing to do with the intere&s;ts of France or any other power. We mu&s;t take care not to infringe their rights, and leave the care of their intere&s;ts to them&s;elves. It is the in|tere&s;t of France to make us quarrel with Britain, and of Britain to make us quarrel with France; becau&s;e both wi&s;h to render us &s;ub&s;ervient and u&s;eful to them&s;elves, and to make their com|merce flouri&s;h at our expence. It is our intere&s;t to be in peace with them both, and to prevent either from gaining influence in our councils; which we may be a&s;&s;ured they will direct, as far as they can direct them, for their own intere&s;t and not for ours. What becomes of the independence of our country, if we can make no treaty without fir&s;t enquiring whether France or any other power, will be injured or benefited by it? This would make us her &s;ubjects, not her allies. Has &s;he con&s;ulted us in
<PB N="19" REF="028802_0018_0FDD4DA563193AC0">
any of the treaties which &s;he has made? It would be very much to our intere&s;t for her to remain at war with all Europe, becau&s;e &s;he and her enemies are obliged to purcha&s;e our provi&s;ions at an enormous price, and our neutrality gives us immen&s;e advan|tages in the carrying trade; yet it would be unrea&s;onable in us to expect, and very fooli&s;h in her to agree, that the war &s;hould continue longer than nece&s;&s;ary, becau&s;e it conduces to our advantage.</P>
<P>It is contended that this treaty puts our commerce with Bri|tain on a footing very injurious to France, and is therefore an infringement of her rights under the laws of neutrality. This would be a &s;olid objection, if it were true; but is it true? I ap|prehend not. The treaty, it is &s;aid, prevents us from exporting to France the commodities of her i&s;lands. But it was the twelfth article from which this effect was apprehended, and the twelfth article was rejected by the Senate. Be&s;ide, the twelfth article did not &s;ay that we &s;hould not carry the produce of the i&s;lands to France. It only &s;aid that we &s;hould not bring them into our own country, and then re-export them to any country; but we might &s;till, even if the twelfth article had been ratified, carry them from the i&s;lands directly to France, whenever the French them&s;elves would allow us the privilege. It is further &s;aid, that the treaty, by the eighteenth article, gives up the right of carry|ing provi&s;ions to France during the war, and allows the Briti&s;h to capture our ve&s;&s;els if they make the at<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">empt. This, if true, would be a &s;ufficient objection to over-&s;et the treaty; but it is not true: The words of the eighteenth article are the&s;e; "And whereas the difficulty of agreeing on the private ca&s;es in which alone provi&s;ions and other articles not generally contraband, may be regarded as &s;uch, renders it expedient to provide again&s;t the inconveniencies and mi&s;under&s;tandings which might thence ari&s;e, it is further agreed, that whenever any &s;uch articles &s;o be|coming contraband <HI>according to the exi&s;ting law of nations,</HI> &s;hall for that rea&s;on be &s;eized, the &s;ame &s;hall not be confi&s;cated; but the owners thereof &s;hall be &s;peedily and completely indem|nified." Every body knows that there are ca&s;es in which pro|vi&s;ions may become contraband by the law of nations. If there be no &s;uch ca&s;es, then this clau&s;e has no effect; for it ap|plies to ca&s;es where &s;uch articles become contraband <HI>according to the exi&s;ting laws of nations,</HI> and to them only. If there be &s;uch ca&s;es, then the article provides that the provi&s;ions in&s;tead of being confi&s;cated, as they would be by the law of nations, &s;hall be paid for, with frieght, charges, and a mercantile profit. This &s;tipulation of con&s;equence, is greatly in our favour; &s;ince in many ca&s;es it &s;aves our provi&s;ions from confi&s;cation, to which they would otherwi&s;e be liable. It al&s;o operates favourably to
<PB N="20" REF="028802_0019_0FDD4D87413FBF78">
France; for our merchants will be more apt to &s;end provi&s;ions there, when all the ri&s;k they run is that of being carried into England and paid for, than if they were in danger of being not only carried in, but confi&s;cated. Yet this article is repre&s;ented as ho&s;tile to France, and has been called "an attempt to bring even provi&s;ions under the head of contraband."(<HI>a</HI>)</P>
<P>With as little ju&s;tice has the treaty been charged with de|fining and puni&s;hing piracy. It does no &s;uch thing. It agrees in the twenty-fir&s;t article, that if any of our citizens privateer again&s;t the Briti&s;h under foreign commi&s;&s;ions, and are taken, the Briti&s;h may puni&s;h them as pirates. That is, that if our citi|izens choo&s;e to put them&s;elves out of the protection of our go|vernment by committing ho&s;tilities again&s;t a nation with which we are at peace, we will not countenance them; we will not pro|tect them; we will not quarrel with that nation on their account. The treaty does not &s;ay that we will puni&s;h them as pirates, but that the Briti&s;h may, if they catch them. And the Briti&s;h make the &s;ame agreement on their part. Is not this perfectly rea&s;onable? Ought we to engage in the quarrel of every per&s;on among us whom avarice or idlene&s;s may induce to turn privateer again&s;t nations with whom we are at peace? I conceive not. When our citizens take commi&s;&s;ions from other powers for pri|vateering, they mu&s;t look to tho&s;e powers for protection, and not expect that we &s;hould be drawn in to endle&s;s quarrels for the irregularity of their conduct.</P>
<P>This clau&s;e about piracy has been repre&s;ented as extending to per&s;ons who take commi&s;&s;ions in the land and naval &s;ervice of powers at war; but this is a mi&s;take. It is confined intirely to privateers and lettres of marque. As to other commi&s;&s;ions it is agreed, that our citizens &s;hall not accept them again&s;t the Briti&s;h nor the Briti&s;h again&s;t us; and that the laws again&s;t &s;uch offences &s;hall be punctually executed. The treaty &s;peaks of no new laws on this &s;ubject; it expre&s;&s;es only that tho&s;e already made or which may be made hereafter, &s;hall be enforced.</P>
<P>Surely &s;uch laws as the legi&s;lature has thought proper to make ought to be enforced. If they are unwi&s;e or improper the le|gi&s;lature can repeal them; and whether there &s;hall be any ad|ditional ones, depends on its own wi&s;dom, and future con&s;ider|ation. Surely tho&s;e who have the &s;tronge&s;t impre&s;&s;ion of our obliga<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ions to our allies, will not contend that we ought, thro' complai&s;ance to them, to &s;u&s;pend the execution of our own laws, or forbear to make &s;uch others, from time to time, as we may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">udge expedient for the &s;afety and pro&s;perity of our country.
<PB N="21" REF="028802_0020_0FDD4DA6AF8037A0">
make, but al&s;o what laws we &s;hall make, and what we &s;hall ex|ecute, we mu&s;t give up; in my opinion, all claim to the charac|ter of an independent nation.</P>
<P>In all our other treaties, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">in that with France, article 21, in that with Holland, article 19, in that with Sweden, article 23, and in that with Pru&s;&s;ia, article 20, it is expre&s;sly &s;tipulated, that if, while the two parties are at peace, the citizens or &s;ubjects of one take commi&s;&s;ions or lettres of marque from any foreign power to privateer again&s;t the citizens or &s;ubjects of the other, they &s;hall be liable to be puni&s;hed as pirates. In every treaty which we have made this has been a part. If it were unwi&s;e or improper, why has it been done on every other occa&s;ion; or why has it never been complained of? If wi&s;e and proper why &s;hould it not be done now? Why &s;hould we refu&s;e to do that in a commercial treaty with Great-Britain, which we have already done in commercial treaties with the kings of Sweden and Pru&s;|&s;ia, with whom we have little or no intercour&s;e, and who&s;e commerce with us is of very little importance?</P>
<P>Another ground of &s;trong objection to the treaty is, that it did not obtain an immediate, or at any rate, an early, &s;urrender of the we&s;tern po&s;ts.<HI>(a)</HI> The true &s;tate of that bu&s;ine&s;s &s;eems to me to be thus: Great-Britain is in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Po&s;ts, and we, to whom they belong, wi&s;h to get them. Great-Britain promi&s;es to give them up in eighteen months; but ab&s;olutely re|fu&s;es to do it &s;ooner. The que&s;tion then is, will we wait this eighteen months, or attempt by force to get them &s;ooner? If we do it &s;ooner, it mu&s;t be by force; for though very hard pre&s;&s;|ed on that &s;ubject, and repeatedly pre&s;&s;ed, as I am authorized to declare, they po&s;itively and ob&s;tinately refu&s;ed. Let tho&s;e who might be inclined to u&s;e force, recollect that &s;uch an at|tempt would be the beginning of a war; and that is a &s;hort war which la&s;ts only eighteen months. Let them recollect how much trouble the Indians have given us in that quarter; what a va&s;t expence; and how many years it has co&s;t us to bring them to rea&s;on; and how much more unmanagable we &s;hould have found the Briti&s;h and Indians together. The Briti&s;h, it is &s;aid, have encouraged the Indians in the war. That may be. I be|live it is &s;o; but there is a va&s;t difference between &s;ecret encou|ragement and open direct a&s;&s;i&s;tance. It has been &s;aid, that our Envoy ought to have broken off the treaty, unle&s;s the po&s;ts were immediately delivered. But would that have brought us any nearer getting them? Suppo&s;e the treaty had been broken off, what &s;hould we have done next? We mu&s;t have let the Briti&s;h
<PB N="22" REF="028802_0021_0FDD4D8BD4B4ACA8">
keep the po&s;ts, fought to recover them, or begun a new treaty. Would this new treaty have been likely to &s;ucceed better than the other? I think not. They who &s;ay the negotiation ought to have been broken off, &s;eem to me to forget that it was we not the Briti&s;h, who wi&s;hed to treat. They were in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all they wanted, except their old Debts, and they held the po&s;ts as a &s;ecurity for them. We wi&s;hed to get po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of our rights unju&s;tly witheld from us; and we had the choice of negociation or compul&s;ion, for that purpo&s;e. Which was be&s;t? negocia|tion in my opinion; becau&s;e compul&s;ion is uncertain, tedious, and very expen&s;ive.</P>
<P>But it is &s;aid, that we have only the promi&s;e of the Briti&s;h to give up the po&s;ts on the fir&s;t of June 1796, and they may break their word. So they may: and if they had promi&s;ed to &s;urren|der them in &s;ix months, or three, or in a fortnight, &s;till we &s;hould only have their word; and that is all we can have in agreements with nations or individuals. Suppo&s;e we &s;hould go to war with them, and get the advantage; it is very uncertain whether we &s;hould be able to take the po&s;ts, for that would re|quire a very great force: All we could do would be to compel the Briti&s;h to make peace, and agree to give them up by &s;uch a day. Here we &s;hould have no more than their promi&s;e: and that we have got without a war. It is their intere&s;t however to keep this promi&s;e; for our government, in con&s;ideration of it, has agreed to pay their &s;ubjects the damages which they have &s;u&s;|tained by the legal impedement to the recovery of their debts. The po&s;ts are to be delivered before this payment becomes due; and if they &s;hould not be delivered, we &s;hall be at liberty to withhold the payment. This promi&s;e, be&s;ide, is now &s;oon to be performed. The po&s;ts are to be delivered the fir&s;t of next June, about &s;ix monhts, and we under&s;tand the Briti&s;h are now mak|ing preparations for the &s;urrender. Had we not better wait this &s;ix months, and &s;ee whether they will perform their promi&s;e, than quarrel about the delay?</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e fellow citizens, one of you &s;hould come to me as a lawyer and tell me that a per&s;on was in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a tract of your land, lived on it, and had a crop growing: that provided you would leave &s;ome old accounts to arbitration and agree to pay what might be given again&s;t you, he was willing to acknow|lege your reque&s;t, and give from under his hand to move off in the fall, as &s;oon as he could get in his crop, and provide a place for his family; but ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed to go &s;ooner.

for me, I think, that I never gave &s;uch advi&s;e, But how much more mi&s;chievous would it be in the affairs of a nation; where millions of expence, and thou&s;ands of lives would pro|bably pay the forfeit!</P>
<P>The treaty has been charged with permitting by the fir&s;t arti|cle, "the unconditional return to our country of all per&s;ons who were pro&s;cribed during the late war." <HI>(a)</HI> I confe&s;s I cannot &s;ee how this permi&s;&s;ion is to be found in the fir&s;t article. It &s;ays, "there &s;hall be a firm, inviolable, and univer&s;al peace, and a true and &s;incere friend&s;hip, between his Britanic Maje&s;ty, and the United States, and between their re&s;pective countries, territories, cities, towns, and people of every degree, without exception of per&s;ons or places." If this permits the uncondi|tional return of bani&s;hed per&s;ons, how comes it to pa&s;s that they did not return under the treaty of peace, between us and Great Britain, which contains preci&s;ely &s;uch a &s;tipulation. In the &s;eventh article of the treaty of peace, it is a&s;&s;erted that "the&s;e &s;hall be a firm and perpetual peace between his Britanic Maje&s;ty and the &s;aid States, and between the &s;ubjects of the one and the citizens of the other." The per&s;ons who adhered to the Bri|ti&s;h, the royali&s;ts and tories, were all Briti&s;h &s;ubjects, and yet none of them had a right to return under this &s;tipulation in the treaty of peace. How then can they have it under a &s;imilar &s;ti|pulation in the treaty of commerce? The truth is, as it &s;trikes me, that peace and re&s;idence, are things entirely di&s;tinct. A nation may be at peace with another, and yet preclude from its territories, or from all but certain places, all the individuals of that other; as the Chine&s;e and Japane&s;e con&s;tantly do; as well as the Engli&s;h and Dutch with re&s;pect to their Ea&s;t-India po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ions, and the Spaniards with re&s;pect to their dominions in South America. Where two nations intend not only to be at peace, but to give the people of each other mutually the right of re&s;idence, for commerce or any other purpo&s;e, there is always an expre&s;s &s;tipulation to that effect. Suppo&s;e we &s;hould pa&s;s a law making a certain offence puni&s;hable by perpetual bani&s;hment, and a &s;ubject of Great Britain &s;hould come here, commit the of|fence, be convicted of it, and bani&s;hed? Would he have a right under this article, to return, notwith&s;tanding his bani&s;hment? I conceive not. Suppo&s;e a Briti&s;h &s;ubject &s;hould be tran&s;port|ed to Botany Bay, for fourteen years, &s;hould e&s;cape from thence immediately, and come to America? By re&s;iding here five years, concealing his circum&s;tances, and conducting him&s;elf well, he might become an American citizen. Could he, under this article, return and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">
<PB N="24" REF="028802_0023_0FDD4D8D4B433978">
whom they are willing to be at peace. Becau&s;e I agree to live peaceable with my neighbours, are they at liberty to come and live in my hou&s;e?</P>
<P>It has been charged again&s;t the treaty, that it "e&s;tabli&s;hes by the &s;econd article, a Briti&s;h colony within our limits, with peculiar privileges."<HI>(a)</HI> One would &s;uppo&s;e from this expre&s;|&s;ion, that the per&s;ons whom the treaty permits to remain within our limits without becoming American citizens, were to be free from our laws and juri&s;diction, and &s;ubject to tho&s;e of Great-Britain; for that is the import of the word "colony." But is this the ca&s;e? Certainly not. The&s;e per&s;ons, as it appears to me, are to remain within our territory, as Briti&s;h &s;ubjects, pre|ci&s;ely in the manner as hundreds of Briti&s;h &s;ubjects and &s;ubjects of every other country, remain in other parts of our territory; at Charle&s;ton, Philadelphia, New-York, and el&s;ewhere; &s;ubject to our laws in every re&s;pect, liable to taxes, military duty, and all the other burdens of citizens, but deprived of the privileges. The number of the&s;e people is incon&s;iderable; not more than four thou&s;and at all the po&s;ts; &s;ome affirm not more than three. By the &s;urrender of the po&s;ts to the United States, the inhabitants would not only have become citizens, but would have lo&s;t the character of Briti&s;h &s;ubjects, which numbers of them, may wi&s;h to retain. Sooner than relinqui&s;h this character, many of them, perhaps all, would probably have removed before the evacua|tion, and carried with them into Canada their capital, their in|du&s;try, their knowledge of Indian trade, and their Indian con|nections. Thus by the &s;urrender of the po&s;ts we &s;hould have obtained &s;ome &s;pots of earth, of little value, while the Indian trade, the great object of our wi&s;hes, would have been transferred with the inhabitants, to the Briti&s;h dominions. To prevent this, the treaty wi&s;ely provides, that the&s;e people though they conti|nue in our country, may if they plea&s;e, remain Briti&s;h &s;ubjects; a provi&s;ion without which they would by the act of continuing have become American citizens. By this mean ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> of them may be induced to remain. Their indu&s;try will be for us; the pro&s;perity they acquire, the improvements they make, the commerce they e&s;tabli&s;h, for us; their families will grow up citizens; and it is highly probable, that they them&s;elves will &s;oon wi&s;h to become &s;o. Tho&s;e who accu&s;e the treaty of hav|ing admitted the&s;e people to the rights of citizen&s;hip, &s;eem to have forgotten, that if the po&s;ts had been given up without &s;ay|ing a word about them, they would have become citizens. And if they had not, what &s;hould we have done with them? Drive

other ca&s;es, which has been to intice people into our country, not expel them from it. They are di&s;po&s;ed, it is &s;aid, to do us mi&s;chief, and have joined the Indians again&s;t us. Some of them may have done &s;o; but there is no proof that the number was con&s;iderable. And if it were what &s;hould we have gained by driving them off? Would their ho&s;tile di&s;po&s;ition be dimini&s;hed by being expelled from their homes, and &s;eizing their proper|ty? Or would it le&s;&s;en their power to hurt us? No: for they need only move to the other &s;ide of a river, and then they would be in the Briti&s;h dominions, free to execute their malice and re|&s;entment on every favourable occa&s;ion; whereas, while they &s;tay among us, we have their families and their property, as pledges for their good conduct. But extraordinary privileges, it is &s;aid, are granted to the&s;e people. What are the&s;e privi|leges? To keep their property if they &s;tay, and fell it if they go. The&s;e privileges do not &s;eem to have any thing very ex|traordinary in them. To let them &s;tay, and yet take their pro|perty from them, would be &s;omewhat extraordinary; and as to allowing them to &s;ell it if they go away, that is always permit|ted even to enemies, on the breaking out of a war.</P>
<P>It has been alleged that the&s;e people hold va&s;t quantities of land, which by the treaty they are allowed to retain. They can hold no lands but what were held at the treaty of peace, either by them or tho&s;e under whom they claim. The Briti&s;h go|vernment has made no grants &s;ince; and if it had, they would be invalid, being made within what that government it&s;elf ac|knowledged to be our territory. The quantities of land held there at the treaty of peace, are not, as far as I have been able to learn, by any means con&s;iderable: and be it much or little, the per&s;ons who held it, had a right to retain it by the treaty of peace, in common with all other per&s;ons who&s;e lands lay with|in the limits then e&s;tabli&s;hed.</P>
<P>A further accu&s;ation again&s;t the treaty is, that it "erects a tribunal new and unknown to our con&s;titution; ina&s;much as it transfers the right of deciding on the claims of Briti&s;h credi|tors from the courts and juries of America to commi&s;&s;ioners; a majority of whom may be Briti&s;h &s;ubjects and by their deci&s;i|ons, tax the revenue of the&s;e &s;tates at plea&s;ure." <HI>(a)</HI> This ob|jection is made to the &s;ixth article.</P>
<P>But is this the &s;en&s;e of the article? The ca&s;e appears to me to &s;tand thus. Our citizens owed con&s;iderable debts to Briti&s;h &s;ubjects, contracted before the peace. The recovery of the&s;e debts had, in many in&s;tances, been delayed &s;ince the peace, by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">
<PB N="26" REF="028802_0025_0FDD4D8ED003AF88">
under laws. During the&s;e delays many of the debtors became in&s;olvent, wholly or in part, &s;o that even after the impediments were removed, the creditors were not able to obtain payment "in the ordinary cour&s;e of Ju&s;tice." In the&s;e ca&s;es our go|vernment undertakes to indemnify them for the lo&s;s, provided it &s;hould appear not to have ari&s;en from their own "delay, negligence, or wilful omi&s;&s;ion," or from "&s;uch other cau&s;es as would have equally operated to produce &s;uch lo&s;s, if the illegal impediment had not exi&s;ted." The claim mu&s;t &s;till be decided on by our own courts; the creditor mu&s;t &s;ue there; the debtor may make any defence, may &s;hew that the debt never was due, or has been paid, or that a compo&s;ition has been accepted, judg|ment mu&s;t be obtained, and execution i&s;&s;ued, and the money re|covered from the debtor if he be able to pay. Till all this is done, it cannot appear that the debt cannot be obtained "in the ordinary cour&s;e of judicial proceedings." When this ap|pears, the bu&s;ine&s;s of the court ends, becau&s;e they have done all that was in their power. The government then undertaken to be an&s;werable, and the creditor goes before the commi&s;&s;ion|ers. The in&s;olvency being a&s;certained by the&s;e proceedings, the commi&s;&s;ioners enquire whether it aro&s;e from the "lawful impediments afore&s;aid," or has been occa&s;ioned by the delay, negligence, or wilful omi&s;&s;ion of the creditor, or any other cau&s;e which would have produced it, had no legal impediment exi&s;ted? In the latter ca&s;e he can recover nothing. If the in|&s;olvency took place during the war, before the legal impedi|ments commenced, or after they cea&s;ed, he can recover no|thing. If while the legal impediment exi&s;ted, he neglected to go as far towards &s;ecuring his debt as it would have permitted, he can recover nothing. The legal impediment for in&s;tance, might hinder him from &s;elling the property of his debtor, with|out hindering him from obtaining a judgment and execution &s;o as to bind that property: if he neglected to do &s;o he can reco|ver nothing. It might hinder him from obtaining judgment, but not from compelling &s;ecurity; if he did not compel it, he can recover nothing. Hence it appears, that the United States will be liable in comparatively few ca&s;es; and that the bu&s;ine&s;s of the commi&s;&s;ioners is, not to decide upon the debt, to liquidate or enforce it, but where it has been lo&s;t, to pro|nounce whether the lo&s;s has proceeded from a legal impediment created by our government, or from the neglect of the creditor him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Fault has been found with the method of appointing com|mi&s;&s;ioners. Our government is to appoint two, the Briti&s;h
<PB N="27" REF="028802_0026_0FDD4DB14489A2E8">
&s;on, and tho&s;e of the Briti&s;h another; and from the&s;e two per|&s;ons, &s;o named, one is to be drawn by lot, and to be the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> commi&s;&s;ioner. This fifth commi&s;&s;ioner, and one of tho&s;e cho|&s;en by each party, mu&s;t always be pre&s;ent in order to make a board. Could there be a fairer way of appointing the&s;e arbi|trators? I think not. A majority it is true, may be Briti&s;h &s;ubjects, and Briti&s;h creditors; but it may likewi&s;e, happen that the majority will be American citizens and American debtors. The chance is preci&s;ely as great for one as for the other. The probability is, that the choice will be an impartial one on both &s;ides, and will fall on men of talents and integrity, as little connected as po&s;&s;ible, with either party.</P>
<P>"The &s;eventh article," it is &s;aid, "makes re&s;titution for the exten&s;ive &s;poliations lately committed on our commerce, re|mote, expen&s;ive, and uncertain." <HI>(a)</HI> It &s;eems to me, ju&s;t as much &s;o, and no more, as the re&s;titution which we undertake to make Briti&s;h creditors for the lo&s;&s;es occa&s;ioned by legal im|pediments to the recovery of their debts. Nor do I &s;ee how it could be more &s;peedy in either ca&s;e. They undertake to pay us for irregular captures, where indemnification cannot be obtained in the ordinary court of judicial proceedings, we mu&s;t &s;ue in their courts as they mu&s;t in ours, before it can appear whether indemnification can be obtained in that mode.

<P>There have been a great variety of other objections made to this in&s;trument, which the compa&s;s of this addre&s;s, already, I fear, too long, does not permit me to con&s;ider.

The Pre&s;ident and Senate, it is &s;aid, have exerted powers which belong to the whole legi&s;lature, and in &s;o doing have violated the con&s;ti|tution. But, fellow citizens, the con&s;titution is the &s;upreme law of the land, and any treaty, or other act of the government, which is contrary to it mu&s;t be a nullity. The judges of the &s;upreme and inferior courts, who&s;e office it is to expound and enforce the laws, mu&s;t di&s;regard &s;uch an act. They are to judge whether it is law or not; in other words, whether it is contrary to the con&s;titution. In one in&s;tance, they declared a law pa&s;|&s;ed by congre&s;s to be void, becau&s;e they thought it again&s;t the con&s;titution; and no doubt if this treaty &s;hould appear &s;o, to them, they will treat it in the &s;ame manner.</P>
<P>But I cannot conceive that the treaty is contrary to the con|&s;titution. The legi&s;lative power, and the treaty-making power are di&s;tinct in their nature, different in their objects, and placed in different hands. The legi&s;lative power depends for its exer|tion, on the will of our own government alone: the treaty-making power requires the con&s;ent of another government. The legi&s;lative power applies to objects internal, to acts within our own territory, to relations exi&s;ting between our citizens them|&s;elves, or between them and &s;trangers who come among us. The treaty-making power on the contrary applies to objects ex|ternal, to acts which may be done in foreign countries as well as our own; to the relations between us as a nation, and other nations. The legi&s;lative power regulates the conduct of one individual towards another individual; the treaty-making pow|er, that of one people towards another people. The fir&s;t of the&s;e powers, the legi&s;lative, is by our con&s;titution ve&s;ted in congre&s;s; by which I under&s;tand the two hou&s;es, the &s;enate and repre&s;entatives; the &s;econd, the treaty-making power, is given to the Pre&s;ident, under the controul of the Senate.</P>
<P>When therefore the con&s;titution &s;ays in one place, that con|gre&s;s, meaning the two hou&s;es, &s;hall have power "to regulate commerce with foreign nations, and among the &s;everal &s;tates, and with the Indian tribes;" and in another that the Pre&s;ident "&s;hall have power, by and with the advice and con&s;ent of the Senate, to make treaties, provided two thirds of the &s;enators. pre&s;ent concur" how is it to be under&s;tood? The power to make treaties is unlimited and univer&s;al; and we know very well that four fifths of the treaties which have been made for the la&s;t hundred years, either relate wholly to commerce, or contain commercial regulations.

of commerce with a foreign nation, we &s;hall render the power to make treaties, which the con&s;titution gives them, almo&s;t a dead letter. Yet the &s;ame con&s;titution &s;ays, that congre&s;s "&s;hall have power to regulate commerce with foreign nations." The difficulty at once di&s;appears by recurring to the difference between the legi&s;lative and treaty-making powers, in their na|ture and objects. Congre&s;s po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the legi&s;lative power: it being declared by the 1&s;t &s;ection of the 1&s;t article of the con&s;ti|tution, that "all <HI>legi&s;lative powers</HI> therein granted &s;hall be ve&s;|ted in a congre&s;s of the United States, which &s;hall con&s;i&s;t of a &s;enate and hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives." The regulations of com|merce therefore which congre&s;s is authorized to make, are <HI>le|gi&s;lative regulations;</HI> regulations which depend &s;olely on the will and act of our own government, without requiring the con|&s;ent and concurrence of another government; regulations which are to operate in our own country alone. But tho&s;e re|gulations of commerce which are not legi&s;lative, which require the concurrence of other governments, which are to operate in foreign countries, cannot be made by the legi&s;lature; they can be effected only by treaty; and the power of making treaties is given by the con&s;titution, not to congre&s;s, not to the legi&s;la|ture, but to the Pre&s;ident and &s;enate.</P>
<P>When therefore the con&s;titution &s;ays in one place that "all legi&s;lative powers &s;hall be ve&s;ted in congre&s;s" and afterwards enumerates among the&s;e powers that of "regulating commerce," it explicitly declares, that the regulations of commerce which congre&s;s is to make, are legi&s;lative regulations and no other; and when it goes on to give the treaty making power to the Pre|&s;ident and &s;enate, it declares no le&s;s explicitly, that tho&s;e bran|ches of the government &s;hall have power to make all tho&s;e com|mercial regulations, which requiring the con&s;ent of other go|vernments, lie beyond the reach of our own laws, and can be af|fected only by treaty.</P>
<P>This con&s;truction is &s;upported by the authority of a gentle|man whom every American mu&s;t always be proud to quote. Mr. Madi&s;on, &s;upporting the con&s;titution in the convention of Virginia, and refuting &s;ome objections which had been made to the manner of placing the treaty-making power, laid down the di&s;tinction between that and the legi&s;lative power, and ob&s;erv|ed, "that the exerci&s;e of the power mu&s;t be con&s;i&s;tent with the object of the delegation." That is, that the treaty making power mu&s;t apply only to &s;uch acts, &s;uch regulations, as are the proper objects of treaties; and the legi&s;lative power to &s;uch as are the proper object of laws. To rai&s;e money for in&s;tance, is the object of a law, but to agree with a foreign nation for the

the Pre&s;ident and Senate therefore may contract with another power by treaty, to pay it a &s;um of money, yet they cannot lay a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> by treaty to rai&s;e the money. That mu&s;t be done by con|gre&s;s; by the legi&s;lative power.</P>
<P>This di&s;tinction has been adopted and acted upon by our go|vernment in a variety of in&s;tances which have never been com|plained of. Treaties have been made with mo&s;t, if not all, of the Indian nations on our borders; and one has lately been con|cluded with all the tribes northwe&s;t of the Ohio. All the&s;e treaties contain regulations re&s;pecting our commerce with the different tribes. This has never been con&s;idered as uncon&s;ti|tutional; has never been objected to; and yet the con&s;titution &s;ays that congre&s;s, among the legi&s;lative powers that are ve&s;ted in it, &s;hall have that of "regulating commerce with the Indian tribes." The meaning, evidently is, and has always been &s;o un|der&s;tood, that congre&s;s &s;hall have power to make all the <HI>legi&s;|lative regulations</HI> that may be nece&s;&s;ary in our commerce with the Indians: all the regulations which, depending &s;olely on the act of our own government, might be effected by our own laws: while tho&s;e which required the concurrence of the Indians them|&s;elves, con&s;idered as independent nations, and could therefore be accompli&s;hed only by treaty, were left, under the treaty ma|king power, to the Pre&s;ident and Senate.</P>
<P>This has al&s;o been the con&s;tant &s;en&s;e of the American people, and of the United States, in Congre&s;s a&s;&s;embled under the old confederation. The old Congre&s;s had no power to make any legi&s;lative regulations re&s;pecting commerce of any kind. All this the States re&s;erved to them&s;elves. The fir&s;t &s;ection of the ninth article of confederation and perpetual union, enumerates the powers granted to the United States in Congre&s;s a&s;&s;embled, and among them is that of "entering into treaties and allian|ces; provided that no <HI>treaty of commerce</HI> &s;hall be made where|by the legi&s;lative power of the re&s;pective &s;tates &s;hall be re&s;train|ed from impo&s;ing &s;uch impo&s;ts on foreigners as their own peo|ple are &s;ubject to." Here the people of the United States, by their repre&s;entatives in the &s;tate legi&s;latures, declare in the mo&s;t explicit manner, that under the power of "entering into treaties and alliances" treaties of <HI>commerce</HI> may be made; and al&s;o that tho&s;e treaties, unle&s;s it had been expre&s;sly guarded again&s;t by a provi&s;o, might "re&s;train the legi&s;lative powers of the re&s;pective &s;tates," in regulating their own commercial affairs. According to this principle the old Congre&s;s, under the power of "enter|ing into treaties and alliances" exactly the &s;ame power which is given to the Pre&s;ident and Senate by our pre&s;ent con&s;titution, went on to make commercial treaties with all the powers of Eu|rope that could be prevailed on to enter into them; with France,

Surely not. They under&s;tood perfectly the di&s;|tinction between legi&s;lative regulations of commerce, and regula|tions by treaty, and while they retained the former in their own hands, &s;aw the propriety of leaving the latter to that body which the American nation had appointed to repre&s;ent it in its tran&s;|actions with foreign nations; had inve&s;ted with the power of "entering into treaties and alliances."</P>
<P>The Pre&s;ident and Senate, with re&s;pect to treaties, and com|mercial regulations, now &s;tand on the &s;ame ground, which un|der the old confederation, was occupied by the United States in congre&s;s a&s;&s;embled. The Con&s;titution gives the power of mak|ing treaties to the Pre&s;ident, under the controul of the Senate: the old confederation; gave that power to Congre&s;s. Whatever therefore, the old Congre&s;s could do on this &s;ubject under the confederation, the Pre&s;ident and Senate can do under the con|&s;titution. The old congre&s;s could regulate commerce with fo|reign nations and the Indian tribes, as far as tho&s;e regulations were to depend on foreign powers, and to be made by treaty. They did it in many in&s;tances, attempted it in more, and the people of the United States confirmed their acts. It can of con&s;equence be done by the Pre&s;ident and Senate, who have the power, formerly ve&s;ted in the old congre&s;s, of "entering into treaties and alliances." Under the old confederation the pow|er of regulating commerce internally, by legi&s;lative acts, re|mained with the re&s;pective &s;tates; under the con&s;titution, it is given to Congre&s;s. In both ca&s;es it is equally di&s;tinct from the treaty making power. Its being expre&s;sly given to Congre&s;s makes no difference in that re&s;pect; for before it was &s;o given it remained in the &s;tates, was the &s;ame in nature and extent, and could no more controul the treaty making power in one ca&s;e than in the other.</P>
<P>Hence it appears clearly to me that the treaty is not contra|ry to the con&s;titution; not beyond the powers thereby given to the Pre&s;ident and Senate.</P>
<P>It has often been a&s;ked, what benefit do we derive from the treaty? How does it conduce to our advantage? In the fir&s;t
<PB N="32" REF="028802_0031_0FDD4DB7F17C0B88">
place it &s;ettles our former differences with Great-Britain, diff|erences which every day became more and more &s;erious and em|barra&s;&s;ing, and &s;ettles them in a manner con&s;i&s;tent with our rights and our honour. As it was a ca&s;e of mutual and contra|ry demands, we have given up &s;omething in order to gain the re&s;t, and to avoid the danger of a quarrel; which, in my po&s;&s;ible event, mu&s;t have been attended with very great mi&s;chief. And &s;econdly as to our commerce, we have gained important advan|tages in many parts of it, particularly the Ea&s;t-India and Cana|da trade, without making any unu&s;ual or improper conce&s;&s;ion; we have placed the whole of it, for a certain time, on a perma|nent footing in&s;tead of the precarious &s;tate in which it formerly was, dependent on the temporary proclamation of the Briti&s;h government; and we have laid the foundation for a more la&s;t|ing, and a more exten&s;ively beneficial arrangement.</P>
<P>The que&s;tion is not whether this treaty be as advantageous as we could wi&s;h, or had a right to expect; but whether, &s;uch as it is, our intere&s;t requires, all circum&s;tances con&s;idered, that it &s;hould be accepted? Whether there be rea&s;onable ground to hope for more advantageous terms by further negociation; and if not, whether the&s;e terms, &s;uch as they are, be not pre|ferable to an acqui&s;cence under the injuries of which we com|plain, or an attempt to redre&s;s them by mea&s;ures of compul&s;ion? I can di&s;cern, after the mo&s;t careful con&s;ideration, no rea|&s;onable ground to hope for more advantageous terms from nego|ciation; and I am mo&s;t decidedly of opinion that between ac|cepting the&s;e, and either acquie&s;cing tamely in our wrongs, or attempting to vindicate them by compul&s;ory mea&s;ures, of any kind, there ought to be no he&s;itation.</P>
<P>I cannot conclude, fellow citizens, without taking &s;ome no|tice of the means which have been employed to prejudice and inflame the public mind again&s;t this mea&s;ure. The mo&s;t unli|mitted abu&s;e has been heaped on its authors, its advi&s;ers, and its &s;upporters. They have been charged with being corrupted by Briti&s;h gold, with being actuated by a violent hatred to France, and a &s;ervile attachment to Great-Britain. Its particular provi|&s;ions have been mi&s;repre&s;ented, and the whole in&s;trument, the re&s;ult of many months con&s;ideration, has been &s;tigmatized and condemned after a ha&s;ty reading, and very often without any reading at all. One writer<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Features of the treaty.</NOTE> among various other gro&s;s mi&s;re|pre&s;entations, has been &s;o &s;hamele&s;s as to call this treaty, "an al|liance with Great-Britains' no le&s;s than ten times in a work of 67 pages; and to fill &s;everal of tho&s;e pages with objections found|ed wholly on the 12th article which he knew to have been reject|ed
<PB N="33" REF="028802_0032_0FDD4DB986660020">
by the Senate, and con&s;equently no part of the treaty. I &s;ay "&s;hamele&s;s," becau&s;e the other parts of the book &s;hew that he is by no means &s;o ignorant as not to under&s;tand the differ|ence between a treaty of commerce, and "an alliance." Thus al&s;o a per&s;on in Philadelphia writing to his friend in Charle&s;ton, on June 29th, 1795. a few days after the treaty was ratified, &s;ays, that in con&s;equence of the treaty "we mu&s;t either limit ex|ceedingly our We&s;t-Indian trade, or burn the returns which we bring from thence over and above our own con&s;umption, be|cau&s;e Britain, Mr. Jay, <HI>and the Senate,</HI> have prohibited the citizens from re-&s;hipping them,<NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Charle&s;ton City Gazette, July <HI>14, 1795.</HI></NOTE> This writer, as he had read the treaty, mu&s;t have known that all the regulations re|&s;pecting the We&s;t-India trade were contained in the twelfth ar|ticle, which the &s;enate had rejected; and yet he wilfully mi&s;re|pre&s;ents that very article as the expre&s;s act of the &s;enate. With the &s;ame view of mi&s;leading and inflaming the public mind, it is con&s;tantly repeated that the great body of the people are op|po&s;ed to the treaty; that it has received the unequivocal di&s;ap|probation of the citizens from New-Hamp&s;hire to Georgia. Nothing is le&s;s true. I have lately &s;een in the South Carolina State Gazette, of October 27, 1795, a letter from &s;ome per&s;on in Philadelphia to his friend in Charle&s;ton, dated October 10th, in which the writer &s;ays, that he had lately made a tour through the ea&s;tern &s;tates, and found &s;even eighths of the people di&s;gu&s;t|ted with the admini&s;tration, and oppo&s;ed to the treaty and that &s;y&s;tem of intrigue and wicked policy which contrived it. I can contradict this a&s;&s;ertion on my own knowledge. I have &s;pent the whole fall in travelling through tho&s;e &s;tates, and I have no difficulty in declaring that a very great majority of the peo|ple in all of them, perhaps I might &s;ay &s;even-eighths, are per|fectly well &s;atisfied with the treaty: and that I believe is nearly the ca&s;e with all the &s;tates north of the Patowmac. I mention the&s;e among a va&s;t variety of in&s;tances, to &s;hew how much pa&s;|&s;ion and mi&s;repre&s;entation has been employed in deciding on a mea&s;ure which ought to have been judged of with coolne&s;s, can|dor, and good &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>But, fellow-citizens if the treaty were, what I do not think it is, a di&s;advantageous and unequal one, are there no rea&s;ons why we &s;hould acquie&s;ce in it? It is an act of our government, a law, agreed on and enacted by the proper majority of tho&s;e whom we our&s;elves have appointed to make treaties. Is it right to re&s;i&s;t every law which we do not approve, which we believe to be a bad one? When a mea&s;ure is under deliberation it is the duty, as well as the right of every citizen to expre&s;s
<PB N="34" REF="028802_0033_0FDD4DBDF0B8B3B8">

On this &s;ubject I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ake great plea&s;ure in citing the opinion of a very re&s;pecta|ble &s;enator, who voted again&s;t the treaty.

This &s;entiment does him the highe&s;t honour, and is worthy in my opinion, of imitation by every friend to his country.</P>
<P>Such, fellow citizens, are the rea&s;ons which have induced me to believe that the treaty in que&s;tion is "proper and expe|dient." It is uncertain whether any, que&s;tion will ari&s;e upon it this &s;e&s;&s;ion; I do not know or believe that there is any inten|tion in any part of the hou&s;e to appear it.

You can atte&s;t that while I laboured to change our &s;tate government in that part where I thought it ho&s;tile to the rights of a great majority of the people, I neverthele&s;s con|&s;tantly recommended a perfect &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to it while it &s;hould continue to be our government, and di&s;&s;uaded from any attempt to effect the de&s;ired alteration in any other than the con&s;titution|al mode: convinced that the bu&s;ine&s;s of the people is to make or alter governments, not to direct their admini&s;tration; and that altho' it be not only their right but their duty to amend whatever may be wrong in the e&s;tabli&s;hed &s;y&s;tem, every principle of &s;ocial order and public happine&s;s requires that un|til they think, proper to make the alteration, the government, however defective, ought to be obeyed. The &s;ame conduct I &s;hall pur&s;ue here; the &s;ame principles &s;hall &s;till be my guide. If you approve them, your approbation will be a plea&s;ing and precious reward: if you &s;hall di&s;approve, I &s;hall cheerfully &s;ubmit to your determination&punc;</P>
