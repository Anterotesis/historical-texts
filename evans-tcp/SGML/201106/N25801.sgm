While the&s;e things were carrying on, Negotio took his country man Pari&s;mas to his hou&s;e, where he was introduced to his lady.&mdash;Pari&s;mas was &s;truck with a&s;toni&s;hment at the &s;ight, beauty's perfections were all di&s;played, her eyes out &s;hone the diamond, the ruby was rival'd by her lips, the ro&s;e faded when compared with the vivid colour of her cheeks, alaba&s;ter lo&s;t its whitene&s;s when compared with her &s;nowy bo&s;om, her hair of a darki&s;h brown hung in ringling tre&s;&s;es over her &s;houlders, her &s;hape was the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite that imagination can paint, &s;he was decorated in her habit in all the magnif|icence and pride of the ea&s;t,</P>

She received Pari&s;mas, with all that elegance of &s;peech and ge&s;ture, which the height of female accompli&s;hments and ac|quirements are capable of in&s;piring: Pari&s;mas was at fir&s;t lo&s;t in wonder, and was for a while totally incapable of return|ing any kind of compliments, at length he recovred in accents &s;carcely articulate, made as good a return as his &s;ituation was cap|able of admitting, but further acquaintance, though it by no means le&s;&s;ened his e&s;teem of her: yet it gradually dimi&s;hed the awe with which he was at fir&s;t confounded, 'till he could &s;tedfa&s;tly behold her without being confu&s;&s;ed with her charms.</P>
<P>His bu&s;ine&s;s being compleated, Pari&s;mas took an affectionate farewell of Negotio, but infinitely more &s;o of the all accompli&s;hed lady, who by this time had unintentionally made her&s;elf perfect ma&s;ter of his heart and affections. He left Canton, and embarked for London; &s;leeple&s;s nights and joyle&s;s days were by turns the melancholy com|panions of his voyage home, he returned &s;afely, much to the &s;atisfaction of his em|ployers, who a&s;&s;oon as circum&s;tances would admit, &s;ent him again to the &s;ame place on a &s;imilar errand: after a cu&s;tomary cour&s;e he arrived &s;afely at Canton again. The &s;ight or the place reanimated every idea of his
<PB N="6" REF="034307_0005_0FFD7EC5DC911088">lovely lady, for who&s;e &s;ake only he could wi&s;h to live, though his ideas of cha&s;teical honour forbid his expecting or ever de&s;iring to enjoy her.</P>
<P>He landed and directed his cour&s;e to the Hou&s;e of Negotio, who received him with that genteel ceremony which the mo&s;t refined in manners make u&s;e of to tho&s;e they hold mo&s;t dear, the &s;ame plea&s;ed vivacity &s;parkled in his countenance, which Pari&s;mas had formerly ob&s;erved &s;eated there, and he experienced every mark of ge|nero&s;ity as well as affability which Negotio had made u&s;e of on former occa&s;ions, every thing in his hou&s;e appeared with the &s;ame grandeur and life as was u&s;ual, but to the great mortification of our Captain, his ado|rable angel was not to be &s;een.</P>
<P>He a&s;ked no que&s;tions, &s;uppo&s;ing &s;he was ab&s;ent on a vi&s;it to &s;ome friend, at night he retired, but the mo&s;t di&s;mal forebodings that &s;ome dire fatality had be|fallen her; at the return of morning, he again pur&s;ued the pro&s;ecution of his bu&s;ine&s;s, and again waited on Negotio, and for &s;even|teen days &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, dined at his table, but with the mo&s;t cutting mortification at not having the &s;atisfaction of once beholding this admirable lady, or ever once hearing her name mentioned.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="034307_0005_0FFD7EC5DC911088">
At the expiraton of which time having his cargo all on board, &amp; a favourable wind pre&s;enting, he went to take his leave of Negotio, who, with the warme&s;t expre&s;&s;ions of friend&s;hip, was about wi&s;hing a plea&s;ant and agreeable pa&s;&s;age home, when Pari&s;|mas, who&s;e heart &s;uffered the mo&s;t vexing anxiety to have &s;ome information with re|gard to Negotio's lady, thus addre&s;&s;ed him, Dear Sir, you appear po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the &s;ame tranquil di&s;po&s;ition which always ornament|ed you, and your circum&s;tances in life ren|der you a proper object of envy, yet there is one inquiry which labours in my &s;welling bo&s;om, which I am no longer able to &s;up|pre&s;s, I hope therefore you will be &s;o good as to pardon me, when I inquire after your amiable lady, as &s;he has been ab&s;ent the&s;e &s;eventeen days; and I have not once heard her named: Is &s;he living, or is &s;he dead, or ab&s;ent? his emotion of heart was &s;o great that it was plainly perceivable by his uncommon accents. The undi&s;turbed Negotio calmly replied, &s;he is at home &s;ir. May I be indulged with taking leave of her? &s;aid Pari&s;mas. O yes, reply'd Ngotio, I will introduce you to her if you de&s;ire it, but at the &s;ame time, as a friend, I advi&s;e you not to tru&s;t your curio&s;ity too far, as the fight of her may not produce tho&s;e agree|able
<PB N="8" REF="034307_0006_0FFD7E9799682298">&s;en&s;ations as you may now imagine. O Heavens! &s;aid he, with your leave I mu&s;t &s;ee her, my veneration for her is &s;o great, that no con&s;ideration whatever can prevent my &s;eeing her, when in my power. Well, &s;aid Negotio, your wi&s;hes &s;hall be gratified, but if you have in con&s;equence thereof any di&s;agreeable &s;en&s;ations, you will be &s;o good as to blame your own curio&s;ity therefor, and acquit your friend. But however, I think it would be better for you not to think any more on the &s;ubject, but depart in peace. Pari&s;mas who&s;e anxiety every moment aug|mented in a geometrical proportion, replied, &s;ir, urge that matter no further I be&s;eech you&mdash;I am in torment&mdash;di&s;tracted, in the name of friend&s;hip, I conjure you delay me no longer. Friend&s;hip, reply'd Negotio forbids my gratifying you&mdash;I have &s;uch a regard for your peace of mind that I again warmly recommend to give over a de&s;ign which cannot fail of putting your mind in &s;uch a &s;tate, as will be very remote from the &s;malle&s;t ideas of &s;atisfaction. Pari&s;mas replied, the more you endeavour to di&s;&s;uade me, the more anxious I am, and I do conjure you, by every principle of friend&s;hip, to hold me in this cruel &s;u&s;pence no longer, your di&s;|cour&s;e has rai&s;ed my curio&s;ity to &s;uch a pitch, that I am to be delay'd no longer. Well,

Negotio pro|ceeded to unlock a door in the back &s;ide of this hideous department, from which i&s;&s;ued the mo&s;t wretched object that ever ter|rified the eyes of mortals, it was the wife of Negotio, but what a dreadful, horific meta|morpho&s;e! not a &s;ingle trace was left of her former &s;elf; in&s;tead of tho&s;e beautiful charms with which &s;he was formerly po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ed, the mo&s;t frightful vi&s;age that imagi|nation can depict, pre&s;ented it&s;elf&mdash;Her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e&s;h emaciated loft her &s;kin forming <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rinkles of the mo&s;t ga&s;tly a&s;pect, her eyes almo&s;t &s;tarted from their &s;ockets.</P>
<P>She di&s;covered every evidence of the mo&s;t extreme angui&s;h, horror and di&s;pair, her di&s;torted looks were the emblem of rage and di&s;tre&s;s, &s;carcely containing any thing human, the whole decorated with a &s;pecies of na&s;tine&s;s which &s;erved to make the &s;pectacle &s;till more horrid, while a hideous

<P>With a heart confounded with amazement, Pari&s;mas took leave of Negotio, repaired to his &s;hip, &s;carcely realizing were he was, or what he was about.
