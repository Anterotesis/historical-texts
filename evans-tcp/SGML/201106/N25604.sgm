<HEAD>Speech of Edward Living&s;ton.</HEAD>
<P>MR. LIVINGSTON &s;aid he e&s;teemed it one of the mo&s;t fortunate occurrences of his life, that after an inevitable ab&s;ence from his &s;eat in that hou&s;e, he had arrived in time to expre&s;s his di&s;&s;ent to the pa&s;&s;age of the bill. It would have been a &s;ource of eternal re|gret, and the keene&s;t remor&s;e, if any private affairs, however urgent, any dome&s;tic concerns, however in|tere&s;ting, had deprived him of the opportunity he was then about to u&s;e, of &s;tating his objections, and record|ing his vote again&s;t an act which he believed was in di|rect violation of the con&s;titution; and marked with every characteri&s;tic of the mo&s;t odious de&s;poti&s;m.</P>
<P>On my arrival, &s;ir, mr. L. &s;aid, I enquired what &s;ubject occupied the attention of the hou&s;e; and being told it was the alien bill, I directed the printed copy to be brought to me, but to my great &s;urpri&s;e &s;even or eight copies of different acts on the &s;ame &s;ubject were put in my hands&mdash;among them it was difficult (&s;o &s;trongly were they marked by the &s;ame family features), to di&s;|cover the individual bill then under di&s;cu&s;&s;ion. This circum&s;tance give me a &s;u&s;picion that the principles of the mea&s;ures were erroneous&mdash;Truth marches directly to its end by a &s;ingle undeviating path&mdash;Error is either undetermined on its object, or pur&s;ues it through a thou&s;and winding ways&mdash;the multiplicity of propo&s;itions therefore to attain the &s;ame general but doubtful end, led me to &s;u&s;pect that neither the object nor the means propo&s;ed to attain it were proper or nece&s;&s;ary. The&s;e &s;urmi&s;es were confirmed by a more minute examination of the act&mdash;In the con&s;truction of &s;tatutes, it was a re|ceived rule to examine what were the &s;tate of things when it was pa&s;&s;ed, and what were the evils it was in|tended to remedy&mdash;as the&s;e circum&s;tances would be ap|plied
<PB N="4" REF="034008_0003_0FF9F6D449A9C528">in the con&s;truction of the law, it might be well to examine them minutely in framing it&mdash;the &s;tate of things, if we are to judge from the complexion of the bill, mu&s;t be that a number of aliens, enjoying the pro|tection of our government, were plotting its de&s;truc|tion&mdash;that they are engaged in trea&s;onable machinations again&s;t a people who have given them an a&s;ylum and &s;upport, and that no provi&s;ion is found to provide for their expul&s;ion and puni&s;hment. If the&s;e things are &s;o and no remedy exi&s;ts for the evil, one ought &s;peedily to be provided, but even then it mu&s;t be a remedy that is con&s;i&s;tent with the con&s;titution under which we act&mdash;for as by that in&s;trument, all powers not expre&s;&s;ly given by it to the union, are re&s;erved by the &s;tates&mdash;it follows that unle&s;s an expre&s;s authority can be found, ve&s;ting us with the power, be the evil never &s;o great it can only be remedied by the &s;everal &s;tates who have ne|ver delegated the authority to congre&s;s&mdash;but this point will be pre&s;ently examined, and it will not be a difficult ta&s;k to &s;hew that the provi&s;ions of this bill are not only unauthori&s;ed by the con&s;titution, but are in direct vio|lation of its fundamental principles, and contradictory to &s;ome of its mo&s;t expre&s;s prohibitions; at pre&s;ent it is only nece&s;&s;ary to a&s;k whether the &s;tate of things contem|plated by the bill have any exi&s;tence&mdash;We mu&s;t legi&s;late upon facts, not on &s;urmi&s;es&mdash;we mu&s;t have evidence, not vague &s;u&s;picions, if we mean to legi&s;late with pru|dence&mdash;What facts have been produced? What evi|dence had been &s;ubmitted to the hou&s;e? I have heard, &s;ir, of none&mdash;but if evidence of facts could not be pro|cured, at lea&s;t it might have been expected that rea&s;on|able cau&s;e of &s;u&s;picion &s;hould be &s;hewn&mdash;here again gentlemen were at fault&mdash;they could not &s;hew even a <HI>&s;u&s;picion why the&s;e aliens ought to be &s;u&s;pected.</HI> We have, indeed, been told that the fate of Venice, Switzerland, and Batavia, was produced by the interference of fo|reigners. But, the in&s;tances were unfortunate&mdash;be|cau&s;e all tho&s;e powers had been overcome by foreign force, or divided by dome&s;tic faction, not by aliens who re&s;ided among them; and if any in&s;truction was to be gained from tho&s;e republics, it would be that we ought to bani&s;h not the aliens but all tho&s;e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> who did not approve the executive <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> this I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span">
<PB N="5" REF="034008_0004_0FF9F6DA4B98C3E8">were not ready to own&mdash;but if this mea&s;ure prevailed, I &s;hall not think the other remote; but if it had been proved that the&s;e governments were de&s;troyed by the con&s;piracies of aliens, it yet remains to &s;hew that we are in the &s;ame &s;ituation; or that any &s;uch plots have been detected or are even rea&s;onably &s;u&s;pected here. Nothing of this kind has been yet done. A modern The&s;eus, indeed, has told us he has procured a clue<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Harper, declared in the hou&s;e, that he had hold of certain <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> a con&s;piracy.</NOTE> that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> enable him to penetrate the labyrinth and de|&s;troy this mon&s;ter of &s;edition. Who the fair Ariadne is who kindly gave him the ball he has not revealed: nor though &s;everal days have elap&s;ed &s;ince he undertook the adventure, has he yet told where the mon&s;ter lurks. No evidence then being produced, we have a right to &s;ay that none exi&s;ts, and yet we are about to &s;anction a mo&s;t important act, and on what grounds? our individual &s;u&s;picions, our private fears, our over-heated imagi|nations. Seeing nothing to excite tho&s;e &s;u&s;picions, and not feeling tho&s;e fears, I could not give my a&s;&s;ent to the bill, even if I did not feel a &s;uperior obligation to reject it on other grounds. As far as my own ob&s;ervation goes, I have &s;een nothing like the &s;tate of things contemplated by the bill. Mo&s;t of the aliens I have &s;een were either triumphant Engli&s;hmen, or Frenchmen, with dejection in their countenances and grief at their hearts, preparing to quit the country and &s;eek another a&s;ylum. But if the&s;e plots exi&s;t, if this trea&s;on is apparent, if there are aliens guilty of the crimes that are a&s;cribed to them, an effectual remedy pre&s;ents it&s;elf for the evil; we have al|ready wi&s;e laws, we have upright judges and vigilant magi&s;trates, and there is no nece&s;&s;ity of arming the exe|cutive with the de&s;tructive power propo&s;ed by the bill now on your table&mdash;the laws now in force are competent to puni&s;h every trea&s;onable or &s;editions attempt.</P>
<P>But grant, &s;ir, what however has not been at all &s;upported by fact, grant that the&s;e fears are not vi|&s;ionary, that the dangers are imminent and that no ex|i&s;ting law is &s;ufficient to avert them; let us examine whether the provi&s;ions of the bill are conformable to the principles of the con&s;titution: if it &s;hould be found to
<PB N="6" REF="034008_0005_0FF9F762859ED7C0">contravene them, I tru&s;t it will lo&s;e many of its pre|&s;ent &s;upporters; but if not only contrary to the gene|ral &s;pirit and principles of the con&s;titution, it &s;hould al&s;o be found diametrically oppo&s;ite to its mo&s;t expre&s;s prohibitions, I cannot doubt that it would be rejected with that indignant deci&s;ion which our duty to our country, and our &s;acred oath demands.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t &s;ection provides that it &s;hall be lawful for the Pre&s;ident, "to order all &s;uch aliens as he &s;hall <HI>judge dangerous</HI> to the peace and &s;afety of the United States, or &s;hall have <HI>rea&s;onable ground to &s;u&s;pect</HI> are con|cerned in any <HI>trea&s;onable or &s;ecret machinations</HI> again&s;t the goverment thereof, to depart out of the United States, in &s;uch time as &s;hall be expre&s;&s;ed in &s;uch order."</P>
<P>Our goverment, &s;ir, is founded on the e&s;tabli&s;hment of tho&s;e principles which con&s;titute the difference be|tween a free con&s;titution, and a de&s;potic power; a di|&s;tribution of the legi&s;lative, executive and judiciary powers, into &s;pecial hands, a di&s;tribution, &s;trongly marked in three fir&s;t and great divi&s;ions of the con&s;ti|tution&mdash;by fir&s;t&mdash;all legi&s;lative power is gi|ven to Congre&s;s, the &s;econd ve&s;ts all executive func|tions in the pre&s;ident, and the third declares that the judiciary power &s;hall be exerci&s;ed by the &s;upreme and inferior courts; here then is a divi&s;ion, of the gover|mental powers &s;trongly marked, deci&s;ively pronoun|ced, and every act of one or all of the branches that tends to confound the&s;e powers, or alter this arrange|ment mu&s;t be de&s;tructive of the con&s;titution: examine then, &s;ir, the bill on your table, and declare whether the few lines I have repeated from the fir&s;t &s;ection do not confound the&s;e fundamental powers of the govern|ment, ve&s;t them all in the mo&s;t unqualified terms in one hand, and thus &s;ubvert the ba&s;is on which our liberties re&s;t.</P>
<P>Legi&s;lative power pre&s;cribes the rule of action; the judiciary applies that general rule to particular ca&s;es, and it is the province of the executive to &s;ee that the laws are carried into full effect. In all free gover|ments the&s;e powers are exerci&s;ed by different men, and their union in the &s;ame hand is the peculiar character|i&s;tic of de&s;poti&s;m: if the &s;ame power that makes the law can con&s;true it to &s;uit his intere&s;t and apply it to
<PB N="7" REF="034008_0006_0FF9F6E656A01570">gratify his vengance, if he can go further, and execute according to his own pa&s;&s;ions, the judgment which he, him&s;elf, has pronounced upon his own con&s;truction, of laws, which he alone has made, what other features are wanted to complete the picture of tyrany; yet all <HI>this and more</HI> is propo&s;ed to be done by this act; by it the pre&s;ident alone, is empowered to make the law, to fix in his own mind, what acts, what words what thoughts or looks, &s;hall con&s;titute the crime contemplated by the bill; that is the crime of being "&s;u&s;pected to be dangerous to the peace and &s;afety of the United States." He is not only authorized to make this law, for his, own conduct, but to vary it at plea&s;ure, as every gu&s;t of pa&s;&s;ion, every cloud of &s;u&s;picion, &s;hall agitate or darken his mind; the &s;ame power that formed the law then applies it to the guilty or innocent victim whom his own &s;u&s;picions or the &s;ecret whi&s;per of a &s;py have de&s;ignated as its object; the pre&s;ident then having made the law, the pre&s;ident having con&s;idered and ap|plied it, the &s;ame pre&s;ident is by the bill, authorized to execute his &s;entence, in ca&s;e of di&s;obedience, by impri&s;onment, <HI>during his plea&s;ure.</HI> This, then comes completely within the definition of de&s;poti&s;m, and uni|on of legi&s;lative, executive, and judicial powers. But this bill, &s;ir, does not &s;top here, its provi&s;ions are a refinement upon de&s;poti&s;m and pre&s;ent an image of the mo&s;t fearful tyranny&mdash;Even in de&s;poti&s;ms, though the monarch legi&s;lates, judges and executes, yet he le|gi&s;lates openly, his laws though oppre&s;&s;ive, are known, they precede the offence, and every man who choo&s;es may avoid the penalties of di&s;obedience. Yet he jud|ges and executes by proxy, and his pre&s;ent intere&s;t or pa&s;&s;ions do not inflame the mind of his deputy.</P>
<P>But here the law is clo&s;ely concealed in the &s;ame mind that gives it birth&mdash;the crime is "exciting the &s;u&s;picions of the pre&s;ident," but no man can tell what conduct will avoid that &s;u&s;picion&mdash;a carele&s;s word, perhaps mi&s;repre&s;ented or never &s;poken, may be &s;uffi|cient evidence, a look may de&s;troy, an idle ge&s;ture may in&s;ure puni&s;hment, no innocence can protect&mdash;no circum&s;pection can avoid the jealou&s;y of &s;u&s;picion&mdash;&s;urrounded by &s;pies, informers and all that infamous herd which fatten under laws like this. The unfortu|nate
<PB N="8" REF="034008_0007_0FF9CAE81F0E8FC0">&s;tranger will never know either of the law, of the accu&s;ation or of the judgment until the moment it is put into execution&mdash;he will dete&s;t your tyranny, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> from a land of delators, inqui&s;itions and &s;pies.</P>
<P>This, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> the dete&s;table contri|vance of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> the table of their laws <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> high that few could read them; a tall man, however, might reach, a &s;hort one might climb and learn their contents, but here is the law is equally in|acce&s;&s;ible to high and low; &s;afely concealed in the brea&s;t of its author, no indu&s;try or caution can pene|trate this rece&s;s and attain a knowlege of its provi&s;ions, nor even if they could, as the rule is not permanent would it at all avail.</P>
<P>Having &s;hewn that this act is at war with the funda|mental principles of our government, I might &s;top here in the certain hope, of its rejection&mdash;But I can do more; unle&s;s we are re&s;olved to pervert the meaning of terms, I can &s;hew that the con&s;titution has endea|voured to "make its &s;urety doubly &s;ure, and take a bond of fate!" by &s;everal expre&s;s prohibitions of mea|&s;ures like that you now contemplate. One of the&s;e is contained in the 9th &s;ection of the fir&s;t article, it is at the head of the articles which re&s;trict the powers of Congre&s;s, and declares "that the <HI>migration or impor|tation</HI> of &s;uch per&s;ons, as any of the &s;tates, &s;hall think proper to omit, &s;hall not be prohibited prior to the year 1808" Now, &s;ir, where is the difference between a power to prevent the arrival of aliens and a power to &s;end them away as &s;oon as they &s;hall arrive? to me they appear preci&s;ely the &s;ame. The con&s;titution ex|pre&s;sly &s;ays, that congre&s;s &s;hall not do this, and yet congre&s;s are about to delegate this prohibited power, and &s;ay, that the pre&s;ident may excerci&s;e it as often as his plea&s;ure may direct. I am informed that an an&s;wer has been attempted to this argument, by &s;ay|ing, that the article, though it &s;peaks of <HI>"per&s;ons."</HI> only relates to &s;laves? But a conclu&s;ive reply to this an&s;wer may be drawn from the words of the &s;ection, it &s;peaks of migration and importation; if it related on|ly to &s;laves, <HI>"importation,"</HI> would have been &s;uffici|ent; but how can the other word apply to &s;laves; mi|gration is a voluntary change of a country; but who
<PB N="9" REF="034008_0008_0FF9F7758A404098">ever heard of a migration of &s;laves! the truth is, both words have their appropriate meaning, and even ex|tended to &s;ecure the intere&s;ts of different quarters of the union? The middle &s;tates wi&s;hed to &s;ecure them&s;elves again&s;t any laws that might impede the emigration of &s;ettlers; the &s;outhern &s;tates did not like to be prohibi|ted in the importation of &s;laves, and &s;o jealous were they of this provi&s;ion, that the fifth article was intro|duced to declare that the con&s;titution &s;hall not be a|mended &s;o as to do it away.</P>
<P>But even admit the ab&s;urdity, that the word, "mi|gration" has no meaning, or one foreign to its u&s;ual acceptation, and that the article relates only to &s;laves; Even this &s;acrifice of common &s;en&s;e will not help gen|tlemen out of their dilemma&mdash;&s;laves probably always, but certainly on their fir&s;t importation, are <HI>aliens,</HI> many people think they are always "dangerous to the peace and &s;afety of the United States!" if the pre&s;ident &s;hould be of this opinion, he not only can, but by the terms of this law, is obliged to order them off; for the act creates an obligation on him to &s;end away all &s;uch <HI>aliens</HI> as he &s;hall judge dangerous to the peace or &s;afety of the United States. Thus, according to the mo&s;t fa|vourable con&s;truction, every proprietor of this &s;pecies of property, holds it at the will and plea&s;ure of the pre|&s;ident&mdash;and this, too, in defiance of the only article of the con&s;titution, that is declared to be <HI>unalterable.</HI>&mdash;But let us, &s;ir, for a moment, if it be po&s;&s;ible, let us imagine that a con&s;titution, founded on a divi&s;ion of powers, into three hands, may be pre&s;erved, although all the&s;e powers &s;hould be &s;urrendered into one; let us imagine, if we can, that the &s;tates intended to re|&s;trict the general government, from preventing the ar|rival of per&s;ons whom they were yet willing to &s;uffer that &s;ame general goverment to &s;hip off as &s;oon as they &s;hould arrive: grant all this; and they will be as far from e&s;tabli&s;hing the con&s;titutionality of the bill, as they were at the fir&s;t moment it was propo&s;ed&mdash;for in the 3d article it is provided, that all "judicial power &s;hall be ve&s;ted in the &s;upreme and inferior courts," that the trial of "all crimes &s;hall be by jury," ex|cept in ca&s;e of impeachment; and in the 7th and 8th amendments, provi&s;ion is repeated and enforced by
<PB N="10" REF="034008_0009_0FF9F7C36DB468B0">others this which declare, that "no man &s;hall be held to an&s;wer for a capital or otherwi&s;e infamous crime, unle&s;s on a pre&s;entment of a grand jury" that "in all <HI>criminal pro&s;ecutions</HI> the accu&s;ed &s;hall enjoy the right to a &s;peedy and <HI>public</HI> trial, by an impartial <HI>jury</HI> of the &s;tate and di&s;trict where the crime &s;hall have been committed, which di&s;trict &s;hall have been previou&s;ly a&s;certained by law; and to be <HI>informed</HI> of the <HI>nature</HI> and <HI>cau&s;e</HI> of the accu&s;ation, to be <HI>confronted</HI> with the witne&s;&s;es again&s;t him, to have compul&s;ory proce&s;s for obtaining witne&s;&s;es in his favour, and to have the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of council for his defence"&mdash;Now, &s;ir, what minute article in the&s;e &s;everal provi&s;ions of the con&s;ti|tution is there that is not violated by this bill? all the bulwarks which it oppo&s;ed to encroachments on per&s;o|nal liberty, fall before this engine of oppre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P><HI>Judiciary power</HI> is taken from courts, and given to the executive, the previous &s;afeguard of a pre&s;entment by a grand inque&s;t is removed, the trial by jury is abo|li&s;hed: the "<HI>public trial</HI> required by the con&s;titution is changed into a &s;ecret and wor&s;e than inqui&s;itorial tribu|nal: in&s;tead of giving "information of the nature and cau&s;e of the accu&s;ation," the criminal, alike ignorant of his offence and the danger to which he is expo&s;ed, never hears of either until the judgment is pa&s;&s;ed, and the &s;entence is executed: in&s;tead of being <HI>"confronted with his accu&s;ers,"</HI> he is kept alike ignorant of their names and their exi&s;tence, and even the forms of a trial being di&s;|pen&s;ed with, it would be a mockery to talk of "proce&s;s for witne&s;&s;es," or the "a&s;&s;i&s;tance of council for de|fence," thus are all the barriers which the wi&s;dom and humanity of our country had placed between accu&s;ed in|nocence and oppre&s;&s;ive power at once forced and broke down. Not a ve&s;tige even of their form remains. No indictment, no jury, no trial&mdash;no public procedure, no &s;tatement of the accu&s;ation; no examination of the wit|ne&s;&s;es in its &s;upport. No council for defence&mdash;all is darkne&s;s, &s;ilence, my&s;tery, and &s;u&s;picion. But as if this were not enough; the unfortunate victims of this law are told in the next &s;ection that if they can convince the pre&s;ident that his &s;u&s;picions are unfounded, he may, <HI>if he plea&s;es,</HI> give them a licen&s;e to &s;tay&mdash;but how re|move his &s;u&s;picions when they know not on what act
<PB N="11" REF="034008_0010_0FF9F7848DB7DB28">they were founded? how take proof to convince him, when he is not bound to furni&s;h that on which he pro|ceeds; mi&s;erable mockery of ju&s;tice! appoint an arbi|trary judge armed with legi&s;lative and executive powers added to his own! let him condemn the unheard, the unaccu&s;ed object of his &s;u&s;picion, and then to cover the inju&s;tice of the &s;cene, gravely tell him, you ought not to complain, you need only di&s;prove facts that you have never heard, remove &s;u&s;picions that have never been communicated to you, it will be ea&s;y to convince your judge, whom you &s;hall not approach, that he is tyran|nical and unju&s;t, and when you have done this, we give him the power he had before, to pardon you if he plea&s;es.</P>
<P>So obviou&s;ly do the con&s;titutional objections pre&s;ent them&s;elves, that their exi&s;tence cannot be denied, and two wretched &s;ubterfuges are re&s;orted to, to remove them out of &s;ight. Fir&s;t, it is &s;aid, the bill does not contemplate the <HI>puni&s;hment</HI> of any <HI>crime,</HI> and therefore, the provi&s;ions in the con&s;titution, relative to criminal pro|ceedings and judiciary powers do not apply. But have the gentlemen who rea&s;on thus, read the bill, or is every thing forgotton in our zealous hurry to pa&s;s it? What are the offences upon which it is to operate? Not only the offence of being "&s;u&s;pected to be dangerous to the peace and &s;afety of the United States," but al&s;o that of being "concerned in any <HI>trea&s;onable</HI> or &s;ecret machina|tions again&s;t the <HI>government thereof.</HI>" And this we are told is no <HI>crime!</HI> a <HI>trea&s;onable</HI> machination again&s;t the government, is not the &s;ubject of criminal juri&s;pru|dence! good heaven, to what ab&s;urdities does an over zealous attachment to particular mea&s;ures lead us! in order to puni&s;h a particular act, we are forced to &s;ay, that trea&s;on is no crime, and plotting again&s;t our govern|ment is no offence. And to &s;upport this fine hypothe|&s;is, we are obliged to plunge deeper in ab&s;urdity and &s;ay, that as the acts &s;poken of in the bill, are no crimes; &s;o the penalty contained in it is no <HI>puni&s;hment,</HI> it is only a <HI>prevention;</HI> that is to &s;ay, we invite &s;trangers to come among us, we declare &s;olemnly that government &s;hall not have the power to prevent them&mdash;we entice them over by delu&s;ive pro&s;pects of advantage, in many parts of the union we permit them to hold lands, and give
<PB N="12" REF="034008_0011_0FF9F7D4DB2372E0">them other advantages, while they are waiting for the period at which we have promi&s;ed a full participation of all our rights&mdash;an unfortunate &s;tranger, di&s;gu&s;ted with tyranny at home, thinks he &s;hall find freedom here, he accepts your conditions, he puts faith in your promi&s;es, he re&s;ts his whole property in your hands, he has di&s;&s;olv|ed his former connections and made your country his own. But while he is patiently waiting the expiration of the period that is to crown the work, and entitles him to all the rights of a citizen, the tale of a dome&s;tic &s;py, or the calumny of a &s;ecret enemy draws on him the &s;u&s;picions of the pre&s;ident&mdash;and, unheard, he is ordered to quit the &s;pot which he &s;olicited for his retreat, the country he had cho&s;en for his own, perhaps the family which was his only con&s;olation in life, he is ordered to re|tire to a country who&s;e government irritated by his re|nunciation of its authority, will receive only to puni&s;h him&mdash;and all this we are &s;eriou&s;ly told is <HI>no puni&s;hment.</HI></P>
<P>Again we are told, that the con&s;titutional compact was made between citizens only; and that therefore, its provi&s;ions were not intended to extend to <HI>aliens,</HI> and that this act operating only on there, is therefore not forbidden by the con&s;titution. But unfor|tunately, neither common law, common ju&s;tice, nor the practice of any civilized nation will permit this di&s;tinction: It is an ac|knowledged principle of the common law, the authority of which is e&s;tabli&s;hed here, that alien friends (and permit me to ob&s;erve that they are &s;uch only, whom we contemplate by this bill, for we have another before us, to &s;end off alien enemies), re&s;iding among us, are entitled to the protection of our laws. And that during their re&s;idence they owe a temporary allegiance to our government. If they are accu&s;ed of violating this allegiance, the &s;ame laws that interpo&s;e in the ca&s;e of a citizen, mu&s;t determine the truth of the accu&s;ation, and if found guilty they are liable to the &s;ame puni&s;h|ment; this rule is con&s;onant to the principles of common ju&s;tice; for who would ever re&s;ort to another country, if he alone was marked out as the object of arbitrary power? It is equally un|fortunate too for this argument, that the con&s;titution expre&s;sly excludes any idea of this di&s;tinction, it &s;peaks of all "judicial power"&mdash;"all trials for crimes, all "criminal pro&s;ecutions"&mdash;all "per&s;ons accu&s;ed." No di&s;tinction between citizen and alien, between high or low; friends or oppo&s;ers of the executive power, republican and royali&s;t. All, all are entitled to the &s;ame equal di&s;tribution of ju&s;tice, to the &s;ame humane provi&s;ions to protect their innocence&mdash;all are liable to the &s;ame puni&s;hment that awaits their guilt. How comes it too if then the con&s;titutional provi&s;ions were intended for the &s;afety of the citizen only, that our courts
<PB N="13" REF="034008_0012_0FF9F7922ACF5DA8">uniformly extend them to all, and that we never heard it enquired whether the accu&s;ed is a citizen before we give him a public trial by jury.</P>
<P>So manife&s;t do the&s;e violations of the con&s;titution ap|pear to me, &s;o futile the arguments in their defence, that they pre&s;s &s;eriou&s;ly upon my mind and &s;ink it even to de&s;pondency&mdash;they have been &s;o glaring to my under&s;tanding, that I felt it my duty to &s;peak of them in a manner that may perhaps give offence to men whom I e&s;teem and who &s;eem to think differently on that &s;ubject&mdash;none, however, I can a&s;&s;ure them is intended.</P>
<P>I have &s;een mea&s;ures carried in this hou&s;e which I thought militated again&s;t the &s;pirit of the con&s;titution, but never before have I been witne&s;s to &s;o open, &s;o wan|ton, and undi&s;gui&s;ed an attack. I have now done, &s;ir, with the act and come to con&s;ider the con&s;equences of its operation.</P>
<P>One of the mo&s;t &s;erious has been anticipated when I de&s;cribed the blow it would give to the con&s;titution of our country&mdash;we &s;hould cautiou&s;ly beware of the fir&s;t act of violation; habituated to over leap its bounds, we become familiarized to the guilt and di&s;regard the danger of a &s;econd offence&mdash;until proceeding from one unauthorized act to another, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> at length throw of all the re&s;traints which our con&s;titution has impo&s;ed; and very &s;oon not even the &s;emblance of its forms will re|main.</P>
<P>But if regardle&s;s of our duty as citizens, and our &s;olem obligation as repre&s;entatives, regardle&s;s of the rights of our con&s;tituents&mdash;of their opinion and that of po&s;terity&mdash;regardle&s;s of every &s;anction, human and divine&mdash;if <HI>we</HI> are ready to violate the con&s;titution we have &s;worn to defend&mdash;will the PEOPLE SUBMIT to our unauthorized acts? will the &s;tates &s;anction our u&s;urped power? Sir, they ought not to &s;ubmit&mdash;they would de|&s;erve the chains which the&s;e mea&s;ures are forging for them, if they did not re&s;i&s;t. For let no man vainly imagine that the evil is to &s;top here, that a few unprotected ali|ens only are to be affected by this inqui&s;itorial power; the &s;ame arguments which enforce tho&s;e provi&s;ions a|gain&s;t aliens, apply with equal &s;trength to enacting them in the ca&s;e of citizens: the citizen has no other pro|tection for his per&s;onal &s;ecurity that I know, again&s;t laws like this, than the humane provi&s;ions I have cited
<PB N="14" REF="034008_0013_0FF9F7E417CB4B18">from the con&s;titution: but all the&s;e apply in common to the ci|tizen and the &s;tranger: <HI>"All crimes"</HI> are to be tried by jury&mdash;"No <HI>per&s;on</HI>" &s;hall be held to an&s;wer unle&s;s on pre&s;entment: in all <HI>cri|minal pro&s;ecutions</HI> the <HI>"accu&s;ed"</HI> is to have a public trial: the "ac|cu&s;ed" is to be informed of the nature of the charge: to be con|fronted with the witne&s;&s;es again&s;t him. May have proce&s;s to en|force the appearance of tho&s;e in his favour, and is to be allowed council for his defence&mdash;Unle&s;s, therefore, we can believe that <HI>trea&s;onable machinations</HI> and the other offences de&s;cribed in the bill are not <HI>crimes</HI>&mdash;that an alien is not a <HI>per&s;on</HI>&mdash;and that one charged with trea&s;onable practices is not <HI>"accu&s;ed"</HI>&mdash;unle&s;s we can believe all this, in contradiction to our own under&s;tandings, to received opinions and the uniform practice of our courts, we mu&s;t allow that all the&s;e provi&s;ions extend equally to aliens and natives, and that the citizen has no other &s;ecurity for his per&s;onal &s;afety than is extended to the &s;tranger, who is within his gates; if, therefore, this &s;ecurity is violated in one in&s;tance, what pledge have we that it will not in the other? The &s;ame plea of nece&s;&s;ity will ju&s;tify both: either the offences de&s;cribed in the act are crimes, or they are not; if they are, then all the humane provi&s;ions of the con&s;ti|tution forbid the mode of puni&s;hing or preventing them equally as relates to aliens and citizens. If they are not crimes, then the ci|tizen has no more &s;afety by the con&s;titution than the alien has; for all tho&s;e provi&s;ions apply only to <HI>crimes.</HI> So that in either event, the citizen has the &s;ame rea&s;on to expect a &s;imilar law to the one now before you; which &s;ubjects his per&s;on to the uncontrolled de&s;poti&s;m of a &s;ingle man. You have already been told of plots, con&s;piracies&mdash;and all the frightful images that were nece&s;&s;ary to keep up the pre&s;ent &s;y&s;tem of terror and alarm were pre&s;ented to you: but who were implicated by the&s;e dark hints&mdash;the&s;e my&s;te|rious allu&s;ions?&mdash;they were our own citizens, &s;ir, not aliens: if there is then any nece&s;&s;ity for the &s;y&s;tem now propo&s;ed, it is more nece&s;&s;ary to be enforced again&s;t our own citizens, than again&s;t &s;trangers; and I have no doubt that either in this, or &s;ome other &s;hape they will be attempted. I now a&s;k, &s;ir, whether the people of America are prepared for this? Whether they are willing to part with all the means which the wi&s;dom of their ance&s;tors di&s;co|vered; and their own caution &s;o lately adopted to &s;ecure the liberty of their per&s;ons? Whether they are ready to &s;ubmit to impri|&s;onment, or exile, whenever &s;u&s;picion, calumny or vengeance, &s;hall mark them for ruin? Are they ba&s;e enough to be prepared for this? No, &s;ir, they will, I repeat it, they will re&s;i&s;t this ty|rannic &s;y&s;tem; the people will oppo&s;e, the &s;tates will not &s;ubmit to its operation: they ought not to acquie&s;ce, and I pray to God they never may. My opinions, &s;ir, on this &s;ubject are explicit, and I wi&s;h they may be known; they are, that whenever our laws ma|nife&s;tly infringe the con&s;titution under which they were made, the people ought not to he&s;itate which they &s;hould obey: if we exceed our powers, we become tyrants, and our acts have no effect.
<PB N="15" REF="034008_0014_0FF9F7A33498D418">Thus, &s;ir, one of the fir&s;t effects of mea&s;ures &s;uch as this, if they &s;hould not be acquie&s;ced in, will be di&s;affection among the &s;tates, and oppo&s;ition among the people to your government; tumults, violence, and a recurrence to fir&s;t revolutionary principles. If they are &s;ubmitted to, the con&s;equences will be wor&s;e&mdash;After &s;uch manife&s;t violation of the principles of our con&s;titution, the form will not long be &s;acred; pre&s;ently every ve&s;tige of it will be lo&s;t and &s;wallowed up in the gulph of de&s;poti&s;m&mdash;but &s;hould the evil proceed no further than the execution of the pre&s;ent law, what a fearful picture will our country pre&s;ent&mdash;the &s;y&s;tem of <HI>e&s;pionage</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> e&s;tabli&s;hed; the country will &s;warm with informers, &s;pies, delators, and all that odious reptile tribe that breed in the &s;un&s;hine of de&s;potic power, that &s;uck the blood of the unfortunate, and creep into the bo&s;om of &s;leeping innocence only to wake it with a burning wound&mdash;the hours of the mo&s;t un&s;u&s;pecting confidence; the intimacies of friend&s;hip, or the rece&s;&s;es of dome&s;tic retirement, afford no &s;ecurity: the companion whom you mo&s;t tru&s;t, the friend in whom you confide, the dome&s;tic who waits in your chamber, are all tempted to betray your imprudence or guardle&s;s follies; to mi&s;repre&s;ent your words; to convey them, di&s;torted by calumny, to the &s;ecret tribunal where jealou&s;y pre&s;ides; where fear officiates as accu&s;er, and &s;u&s;picion is the only evidence that is heard.</P>
<P>The&s;e, bad as they are, are not the only ill con&s;equences of the&s;e mea&s;ures: among them we may reckon the lo&s;s of wealth, of population, and of commerce. Gentlemen who &s;upport the bill, &s;eemed to be aware of this, when ye&s;terday they introduced a clau&s;e to &s;ecure the property of tho&s;e who might be ordered to go off; they &s;hould have fore&s;een the con&s;equences of the &s;teps they have been taking; it is now too late to di&s;cover that large &s;ums are drawing from the banks, that a great capital is taken from commerce. It is ridiculous even to ob&s;erve the &s;olicitude they &s;hew to retain the wealth of the&s;e dangerous men, who&s;e per&s;ons they are &s;o eager to get rid of; if they wi&s;h to retain it, it mu&s;t be by giving them &s;ecurity to their per&s;ons, and a&s;&s;uring them that while they re&s;pect the laws, the laws will protect them from arbi|trary power; it mu&s;t be, in &s;hort, by rejecting the bill on your table. I might mention many other inferior con&s;iderations: but I ought, &s;ir, rather to intreat the pardon of the hou&s;e, for having touched on this; compared to the breach of our con&s;titution, and the e&s;tabli&s;hment of arbitrary power, every other topic is trifling; arguments of convenience &s;ink into nothing; the pre&s;ervation of wealth, the intere&s;ts of commerce, however weighty on other oc|ca&s;ions, here lo&s;e their importance: When the fundamental prin|ciples of freedom are in danger, we are tempted to borrow the impre&s;&s;ive language of a foreign &s;peaker, and exclaim&mdash;"Peri&s;h our commerce, let our con&s;titution live:"&mdash;Peri&s;h our riches, let our freedom live&mdash;this, &s;ir, would be the &s;entiment of every Ame|rican, were the alternative between &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and wealth; but here, &s;ir, it is propo&s;ed to de&s;troy our wealth, in order to
<PB N="16" REF="034008_0015_0FF9F7F210A4A690"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> our commerce. Not in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> but to break it&mdash;not to &s;ecure <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span">.</P>
<P>I have now done &s;ir, but before I &s;it down let me intreat gen|tlemen &s;eriou&s;ly reflect before they pronounce the deci&s;ive vote, that gives the fir&s;t open &s;tab to the principles of our government. Our mi&s;taken zeal, like that of the patriarch of old, has bound the victim; it lies at the foot of the altar; a &s;acrifice of the fir&s;t born offspring of freedom is propo&s;ed by tho&s;e who gave it birth. The hand is already rai&s;ed to &s;trike, and nothing I fear but the voice of Heaven can arre&s;t the impious blow.</P>
<P>Let not gentlemen flatter them&s;elves that the fervour of the mo|ment can make the people in&s;en&s;ible to the&s;e aggre&s;&s;ions. It is an hone&s;t noble warmth, produced by an indignant &s;en&s;e of injury. It will never, I tru&s;t, be extinct, while there is a proper cau&s;e to excite it: but the people of America, &s;ir, though watchful again&s;t foreign aggre&s;&s;ion are not carele&s;s of dome&s;tic encroachment; they are as jealous, &s;ir, of their liberties at home, as of the power and pro&s;perity of their country abroad: they will awake to a &s;en&s;e of their danger; do not let us flatter our&s;elves then that the&s;e mea|&s;ures will be unob&s;erved or di&s;regarded. Do not let us be told, &s;ir, that we excite a fervour again&s;t foreign aggre&s;&s;ion, only to e&s;tabli&s;h tyranny at home; that, like the arch traitor, we cry <HI>"Hail, Columbia,"</HI> at the moment we are betraying her to de&s;truc|tion: that we &s;ing out <HI>"happy land,"</HI> when we are plunging it in ruin or di&s;grace: and that we are ab&s;urd enough to call our|&s;elves <HI>"free and enlightened,"</HI> while we advocate principles that would have di&s;graced the age of Gothic barbarity, and e&s;tabli&s;h a code compared to which the ordeal is wi&s;e, and the trial by battle is merciful and ju&s;t.</P>
