<P>MARRIAGE is an ordinance of God, early in&s;tituted, de&s;igned for his glory, and the &s;ocial comfort of mankind&mdash;that they might not only be help-meets to each other in this world, but that they might help one another forward in their Chri&s;tian cour&s;e towards God's heavenly kingdom. But alas how thoughtle&s;s do many ru&s;h into the marriage &s;tate, as thoughtle&s;s as if God was not to be honored there|by, as &s;tupid as if they were not accountable crea|tures&mdash;But, notwith&s;tanding their in&s;en&s;ibility and &s;tupidity, God often over-rules it &s;o, that &s;uch a thoughtle&s;s pair often live comfortably in this world a &s;ure evidence that God's tender mercies are over all his works.&mdash;God de&s;igned the marriage union <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o be a lively emblem of Chri&s;t and his church, I&s;a. lx <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.5.

There is a mo&s;t near relation between a man and his wife, when they come together as they ought: when they marry in the Lord. 1 Cor. vi. 29. If this union is not near and &s;acred, would the Holy Gho&s;t thus have indited the canticles! What endear|ing expre&s;&s;ions are there u&s;ed, to &s;et forth Chri&s;t and his church. Happy is the pair that thus meet to|gether according to God's direction, when the nuptial bands are tied, they &s;hall never fail of a ble&s;&s;ing: They &s;hall have every thing that is be&s;t for them in this world, and in the world to come everla&s;ting life; they &s;hall live together as the heirs of the grace of life that their prayers be not hindred.</P>
<P>We have an account in our text, where Je&s;us was called, invited to a wedding, and where he wrought his fir&s;t miracle, and turned water into wine: He graced the marriage with his pre&s;ence: The gue&s;ts were a&s;toni&s;hed at the good wine that was brought forth at the la&s;t.</P>
<P>This is a &s;ure evidence that marriage is an ordi|nance of God, and that God de&s;igns to be honored thereby; and tho&s;e that invite Je&s;us to their marriage, &s;hall find a ble&s;&s;ing, &s;hall ta&s;te that love that is better than wine.</P>

<ITEM>I. Shew what is implied in inviting Je&s;us to a wedding.</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. That it is the duty of all when they marry &s;o to do.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P N="1">I. Then, what is implied in inviting Je&s;us to a wedding; there is many things implied in it. Per&s;ons when they are about to marry are thinking about the gue&s;ts they de&s;ign to have at their wedding; they do not u&s;ually invite any but their friends, but tho&s;e that are near to them. Sometimes per&s;ons invite tho&s;e to wedding they do not really want, for fear of affronting them; &s;o a per&s;on may invite Je&s;us for fear of puni&s;hment&mdash;for fear they &s;hall be &s;ent to hell, if they do not a&s;k the pre&s;ence of God, when they really do not want the pre&s;ence of God, when they really do not want the pre&s;ence of God there&mdash;but this is not a right way of inviting Je&s;us, of calling him to the wedding. But,</P>
<P N="1">1. This is implied in inviting Je&s;us to the wed|ding; that when a per&s;on de&s;ires to marry, he looks to Je&s;us for direction; if per&s;ons de&s;ire Je&s;us at the marriage, they will look to God for direction; that they may be directed to a &s;uitable per&s;on&mdash;one that may be an help-meet to them&mdash;one of a &s;uitable temper and di&s;po&s;ition&mdash;one who they may live com|fortable with in this world&mdash;but e&s;pecially one who may be an help-meet to them, to help them forward towards the heavenly Canaan&mdash;one who is an heir of the grace of life, that they may &s;o live together that their prayers may not be hindred. 1 P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t. iii. 7</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="6" REF="043980_0005_101DADB946313480">
2. It implies that they them&s;elves are friends to Je&s;us, and have a high e&s;teem of him, and love for him, that their whole dependance is upon God, and that they will be much in prayer to God for direction and coun&s;el in this great affair; this is the greate&s;t affair that per&s;ons tran&s;act in this world, with regard to them&s;elves, and worldly things; it is for life of one or the other. When they marry if they &s;o come together, as to live as heirs of the grace of life; how great a ble&s;&s;ing! but if otherwi&s;e, how great a cur&s;e!&mdash;Therefore the per&s;on that de&s;ires Je&s;us at the wed|ding, will take his coun&s;el and direction: When he is about to &s;eek a partner of his <HI>cares</HI> and <HI>woes,</HI> he will be much in prayer to God for his ble&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P N="2">II. I am to &s;hew th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> when a couple are about to marry, it is their duty to call Je&s;us, to invite Je&s;us to the wedding; and this will appear plainly if we con&s;ider a few things.</P>
<P N="1">1. Becau&s;e marriage is an ordinance of God. Gen. ii. 18 and in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> and context, &s;o 1 Cor. ii. 7. H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> xiii. 4.

<P N="2">2. It is the duty when per&s;ons are about to mar|ry to invite Je&s;us to the wedding, becau&s;e marriage, or the marriage covenant, repre&s;ents Chri&s;t and his church, Tim. iii. 14&punc; Turn, O back&s;liding chil|dren &s;aith the Lord, for I am married unto <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ou.

<PB N="7" REF="043980_0006_101DADBC3174BC70">for then it was better with me than now. I&s;ai. lxii. 5. For as a young man marrieth a virgin, &s;o &s;hall thy &s;ons marry thee, and as the bridegroom re|joiceth over the bride, &s;o &s;hall thy God rejoice over thee.</P>
<P>The union between hu&s;band and wife is &s;o near, it repre&s;ents Chri&s;t and his church, the Holy Gho&s;t makes u&s;e of this union, this nearne&s;s, this love, throughout the whole of the divine Song of Solo|mon, to repre&s;ent the my&s;tical marriage, love and union between Chri&s;t and his church. Eph. v. 30.</P>
<P N="3">3. Becau&s;e they have no promi&s;e of living com|fortable in this world, or of making an happy end at la&s;t, unle&s;s Je&s;us be with them, unle&s;s they a&s;k his pre&s;ence, and invite him to the wedding. It is as much their duty to call upon Je&s;us to come to this ordinance as any other.</P>
<P N="4">4. Becau&s;e there will be no true joy if Je&s;us be not there, nothing but carnal meriment; there may be carnal meriment and carnal joys where Je&s;us is not; but the&s;e are &s;hort lived plea&s;ures which will bring bitterne&s;s in the latter end. At la&s;t they will bite like a &s;erpent and &s;ting like an adder. But if Je&s;us be there, there will be joy worth having. It is worth while to go to wedding where Je&s;us is to ta&s;te the good wine. Where Je&s;us is, the children of the bride chamber cannot mourn; "Can the children of the bride chamber mourn, while the bridegroom is with them." Matt. ix. 15.</P>
<P N="5">5thly. and la&s;tly. Becau&s;e Je&s;us will come and ble&s;s them if they invite him; he will not do as ma|ny

<P>I &s;hall clo&s;e this di&s;cour&s;e by addre&s;&s;ing my&s;elf to &s;everal &s;orts of per&s;ons, and</P>
<P N="1">1. To the bridegroom and the bride, who are now about to enter into the &s;olemn covenant of mar|riage. My dear friends is our doctrine true, that when a couple are about to enter into the &s;acred co|venant of marriage, it is their duty to invite Je&s;us to the wedding Of what importance then is it that you have the pre&s;ence of Je&s;us with you. I tru&s;t and hope you have thought &s;olemnly of this great tran&s;action, before now, and looked to Je&s;us for coun&s;el, and given him a &s;incere invitation to the wedding. If &s;o you will have his pre&s;ence with you and ble&s;&s;ing to attend you, and he will give you every needed ble&s;&s;ing, every thing that is be&s;t <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> you in this would, and in the world to come <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> ever|la&s;ting.</P>
<P>It is my hearty de&s;ire and prayer to God for you that you may grow up into a family: a family of religion, a family that will always call upon God.
<PB N="9" REF="043980_0008_101DADC49EEC8CB8">That you may have the good will of him that dwelt in the bu&s;h: That you may live together as heirs of the grace of life, that your prayers be not hinder|ed. May you &s;o live together in this world, as to become a lively emblem of the bride, the Lamb's wife, and finally be admited to that &s;tate and world, where there is neither marriage nor giving in marri|age, but where you will be as the angels of God in Heaven.</P>
<P N="2">2. I &s;hall addre&s;s my&s;elf to the unmarried in this a&s;&s;embly. Is our doctrine true; is it the duty of all when they marry to invite Je&s;us to the wedding. Of how much importance is it then that you become friendly to Je&s;us! That you marry to him before you marry to one another, before you are married in this life&mdash;For as we have &s;hewn, friend&s;hip to Je&s;us, is implied in inviting him to the wedding. Depend|ence upon him and love to him; &s;eeking to God by prayer for direction and council in this great affair; this temper and di&s;po&s;ition of heart you mu&s;t have, otherwi&s;e you will not call Je&s;us to the wedding.</P>
<P>O of what importance is it then, that you be united to Je&s;us, in that covenant of which marriage is an emblem! And, if friend&s;hip to Je&s;us is implied in inviting him to the wedding, of what va&s;t impor|tance is it, that when a friend to Je&s;us &s;eeks a wife or hu&s;band, that they &s;eek one that loves God; one that appears a friend to religion, one that loves their Je|&s;us; one that loves to conver&s;e about &s;piritual things; one that can &s;ympathize with them in their joys and &s;orrows; be a partner of their ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">es and
<PB N="10" REF="043980_0009_101DADC621D8FE48">woes in a proper &s;en&s;e: How &s;hould they look to Je&s;us for direction that they may have &s;uch an one.</P>
<P>You that are friends to Je&s;us, if you do not &s;eek &s;uch for your partner, when your marriage day comes you will differ about about your gue&s;ts. The bridegroom de&s;ires to invite Je&s;us&mdash; the bride does not love to (&s;o <HI>vice <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">er&s;a</HI>) &s;o your dif|ference &s;eems to begin before the marriage day. But how can you take one for your neare&s;t and deare&s;t friend, that doth not appear to love Je&s;us; "for whom you have &s;uffered the lo&s;s of all things, and counted it but dung, that you might win Chri&s;t. Phil. iii. 8." You know Chri&s;t tells you, "he that loves father or mother more than me, is not worthy of me. He that loveth wife or children more than me is not worthy of me," &amp;c. Matt. x, 37. Luke xiv, 26. A per&s;on mu&s;t for&s;ake all, that intends to win heaven; therefore it &s;eems nece&s;&s;ary in the na|ture and rea&s;on of things, as well as from the &s;crip|tures, that a friend to Je&s;us &s;hould not marry with one that appears to be an enemy to him, or in other words with an open immoral profane per&s;on, "For how can two walk together except they be agreed." There is no per&s;on that is not a friend in heart to Je|&s;us, ever de&s;ires his pre&s;ence at their wedding. They do not de&s;ire that rejoicing he recommends, they do not like that meriment. Luke xv. 24, "And they began to be merry." No, they had rather have car|nal mirth, they had rather not have Je&s;us there. Therefore, it is of the greate&s;t importance, when a lover of God &s;eeks a partner, to look to God for di|rection and &s;o marry in the Lord.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="11" REF="043980_0010_101DADC927063048">
3. I would turn the addre&s;s to the married in this a&s;&s;embly. Is marriage an ordinance of God. Is it emblematical of Chri&s;t and his church, as we have &s;hewn; yes, &s;urely it is, "marriage is honorable in all, and the bed undefiled, but whore-mongers and adulterers God will judge." Then how &s;hould mar|ried people live together and not profane that &s;acred ordinance. How &s;hould hu&s;bands and wives live together in love and harmony, and be helps meet to one another, not only as to living in this world, but helps to each other in their Chri&s;tian race towards the heavenly Canaan. They &s;hould &s;o live as to be a lively emblem of Chri&s;t and his church.</P>
<P>How much depends upon the example of parents with regard to their children. Example is more than precept. God is wont to ble&s;s the good examples and pious in&s;truction of parents to their children. Saith God I know Abraham, he will command his chil|dren and hou&s;hold after him, and they &s;hall keep the ways of the Lord.</P>
<P>Says Jo&s;hua, "As for me and my hou&s;e we will &s;erve the Lord.</P>
<P>O then let parents be exhorted to walk before their hou&s;es with a perfect heart, and live together as heirs of the grace of life that their prayers be not hindered.</P>
<P N="4">4thly and la&s;tly, I &s;hall turn the addre&s;s to the whole a&s;&s;embly. Is it as we have heard, that per|&s;ons mu&s;t become friendly to Je&s;us in order to have his pre&s;ence with them at the ordinance of marriage. It is &s;o in this ordinance and all others, of what ne|ce&s;&s;ity
<PB N="12" REF="043980_0011_101DA2224A749AF0">then that all become friendly to Chri&s;t, that they be married to him. Without this no duty is acceptable to him; no duty done as God requires without this; no promi&s;e of life being comfortable in this world. No promi&s;e of future well being.</P>
<P>From the&s;e motives let me exhort all to wed with the Lord Je&s;us, to marry to him; con&s;ider he is now courting a bride; he is offering to be married to &s;inners; his voice is, Behold I have prepared my dinner, my oxen and fatlings are killed, all things are ready, come unto the marriage. Matt. xxii. 4.</P>
<P>So Proverbs ix. begins, Wi&s;dom has builded her hou&s;e, &s;he hath hewn out her &s;even pillars, &s;he hath killed her bea&s;ts; &s;he hath mingled her wine, &s;he hath al&s;o furni&s;hed her table; &s;he hath &s;ent forth her maidens; &s;he crieth upon the high places of the city, who&s;o is &s;imple let him turn in hither, as for him that wanteth under|&s;tanding, &s;he &s;aith to him, come eat of my bread and drink of the wine that I have mingled, for&s;ake the fooli&s;h and live, and go in the way of under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>Je&s;us has every charming voice, and charming &s;ound, and charming invitation, to invite &s;inners to come and marry to him Rev. i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> 20. Behold I &s;tand at the door and knock, if any man hear my voice and will open the door, I will come in and &s;op with him and he with me. Again, Rev. xxii. 17. The Spirit and the bride, &s;ay, Come And let him that heareth, &s;ay, Come. And let him that is a thir&s;t come: And who&s;oever will, let him take of the wa+ters of life freely&mdash;Je&s;us invites &s;inners to come one

<P N="2">2. Con&s;ider there is every thing in Je&s;us to induce a per&s;on, in his right mind, to come and embrace him, to wed with hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">.
