<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS AND EXPERIMENTS ON THE USE OF ENEMATA, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>AT the commencement of an E&s;&s;ay upon a &s;ubject in which the Lymphatic Ve&s;&s;els are particu|larly concerned, it may not be improper to give a general view of that &s;y&s;tem; this I &s;hall do in as conci&s;e a manner as po&s;&s;ible.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAPTER I.</HI> Of the Absorbent System.</HEAD>
<P>THAT proce&s;s in the Animal Body which is called Ab&s;orption, is performed by a &s;et of ve&s;&s;els peculiarly appropriated to the purpo&s;e, and not as the ancients &s;uppo&s;ed by the veins: the ve&s;&s;els per|forming this function, are at pre&s;ent known by two names; tho&s;e &s;ituated in the abdomen, and pa&s;&s;ing immediately from the inte&s;tines, have, from their
<PB N="4" REF="033831_0004_0FF978F2D3C946F0">carrying the fluid called chyle, which &s;omewhat re&s;embles milk, been called lacteals. Tho&s;e ab&s;or|bents which originate from the external &s;urface, and other parts of the body, have been denominated Lymphatics; although the&s;e ve&s;&s;els have been di&s;|tingui&s;hed by different names, they are the &s;ame in their &s;tructure and functions.</P>
<P>The lymphatics equal the arteries in their minute and univer&s;al di&s;tribution; there is no part of the animal body, be it ever &s;o &s;mall or ever &s;o remotely &s;ituated, without the power of ab&s;orption. We may apply a fluid to any part of the external &s;urface, and it will be ab&s;orbed; the innumerable examples afforded us by the ab&s;orption of the water of drop&s;y, of matter from internal ulcers and cavities, and al&s;o of the mo&s;t &s;olid parts, in every &s;ituation, proves not only the univer&s;al di&s;tribution, but like|wi&s;e the great power of this function in the animal oeconomy. There is, we may &s;afely &s;ay, no power in the animal machine more nece&s;&s;ary to its exi&s;tence than ab&s;orption: it is commonly &s;aid that we cannot exi&s;t without the circulation, or the nervous influ|ence exerted on the body; we may with the &s;ame propriety &s;ay that an animal cannot exi&s;t without the power of ab&s;orption; for if the performance of this function was wanting, circulation would &s;oon cea&s;e, and without the action of the heart and arte|ries the powers of the brain would immediately be de&s;troyed.</P>
<P>The lymphatic ve&s;&s;els are in general &s;o &s;mall, that their mouths opening on the different &s;urfaces cannot
<PB N="5" REF="033831_0005_0FF97902B83C3D80">be &s;een by the naked eye; this minute &s;ize has prevented their &s;tructure from being &s;o much unra|velled as that of the arteries and veins; it is however certain that they re&s;emble them in &s;ome re&s;pects.</P>
<P>Several experiments and ob&s;ervations have been made in proof of the mu&s;cularity of the ab&s;orbent ve&s;&s;els. Nuck and Cruik&s;hank have both &s;een and demon|&s;trated fibres in the thoracic duct of hor&s;es; the latter of the&s;e gentlemen ob&s;erves, that he has &s;een fibres in a human thoracic duct. The&s;e ob&s;ervations prove that the great lymphatic duct, and perhaps &s;ome of the larger branches of the&s;e ve&s;&s;els have fibres, but every &s;ub&s;tance that is fibrous cannot with propriety be &s;aid to be mu&s;cular. The be&s;t te&s;t we have of mu&s;cularity, &s;ays Mr. Cruik&s;hank, "is the di&s;po|&s;ition in a part to contract on the application of &s;timuli;" this our author found to be the ca&s;e with the ab&s;orbents, and it generally has been concluded, from the&s;e and other ob&s;ervations, that lymphatics are mu&s;cular.</P>
<P>That lymphatics have con&s;iderable &s;trength, even in the dead body, appears from their &s;upporting no &s;mall weight when injected with mercury; I have &s;een a large number of ve&s;&s;els &s;ituated on the leg and thigh &s;u&s;pended by a few branches when all were injected with that fluid.</P>
<P>With regard to the &s;en&s;ibility and va&s;cularity of lymphatics little doubt remains; analogical rea&s;oning would lead us to conclude that they po&s;&s;e&s;s both nerves and blood ve&s;&s;els, and in addition to this,
<PB N="6" REF="033831_0006_0FF97909D0ECB7C8" MS="y">experiment and accidental occurrences prove the &s;ame thing.</P>
<P>The &s;en&s;ibility of lymphatics is &s;ufficiently demon|&s;trated by their taking on a preternatural action upon the application of a &s;trong &s;timulus. Ab&s;orbents have not unfrequently been &s;een in a &s;tate of inflammation, after &s;ome active poi&s;on has been circulating in them; from our pre&s;ent knowledge and theory of inflam|mation, we conclude that it cannot take place where there are no ve&s;&s;els, this then I tru&s;t may be con|&s;idered as a &s;ufficient te&s;t of the va&s;cularity of lymphatics.</P>
<P>Ab&s;orbent ve&s;&s;els, like veins, are furni&s;hed with valves, which in &s;ome parts are &s;o numerous, that half a dozen may be met with in a portion of the ve&s;&s;el not more than an inch in length; the&s;e valves are &s;o formed and &s;ituated that they admirably prevent a retrograde direction of the fluid pa&s;&s;ing in their re&s;pective ve&s;&s;els; their figure is &s;emilunar, they are placed in pairs, one oppo&s;ite the other, with their convex edges attached to the ve&s;&s;el, and they play like moveable partitions; when the fluid pa&s;&s;es in a natural direction they lay clo&s;e again&s;t the &s;ides of the ve&s;&s;el; on the contrary, when the fluid is forced in a retrograde cour&s;e, their loo&s;e edges leave the &s;ides of the ve&s;&s;el, meet each other in the middle, and thus prevent any further progre&s;s of it. Valves, &s;uch as have been de&s;cribed, are uniformly &s;ituated at the entrance of the ab&s;orbent ve&s;&s;els into the thoracic duct, and where this great re&s;ervoir of the lymphatic fluid joins the left &s;ubclavian vein.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="033831_0007_0FF97925200F7178" MS="y">
The manner in which the ab&s;orbents take up fluids from the &s;urfaces of the body remains as yet undetermined by Phy&s;iologi&s;ts; on this difficult que&s;tion I &s;hall not pre&s;ume to decide, but leave it for abler minds than mine to determine. After the fluid has entered the ve&s;&s;el a &s;hort di&s;tance, its motion depends upon cau&s;es &s;imilar to tho&s;e of the motion of the blood in the veins, viz. partly upon the pre&s;&s;ure received from the contracted mu&s;cles and pul&s;ating arteries, and partly upon the action of the lymyhatic ve&s;&s;els them&s;elves. Here the great u&s;e of the valves in the&s;e ve&s;&s;els is made evident; when the ve&s;&s;el is pre&s;&s;ed by the &s;welling of the adjacent mu&s;cles in a &s;tate of contraction, if it were not for the&s;e valves, the fluid would as readily take on a retrograde, as a forward direction, but with this provi&s;ion it mu&s;t pur&s;ue a natural cour&s;e.</P>
<P>Ab&s;orbents, like veins, run from the circumference towards the centre; they originate from every part of the body, pa&s;s in every direction, frequently ana&s;tomo&s;ing and forming net-works, and la&s;tly, are collected in one great trunk called the thoracic duct; this enters into the left &s;ubclavian vein; &s;ometimes the&s;e are two ducts, one entering into the left, the other into the right &s;ubclavian.</P>
<P>The lymphatic glands are numerous, and variou&s;ly di&s;tributed: we find them mo&s;t abundant, in the groins, axillae, the me&s;entary, and about the root of the lungs. After a long inve&s;tigation of the &s;tructure and nature of the&s;e glands, by many different anato|mi&s;ts, little more of their u&s;e is known now than at
<PB N="8" REF="033831_0008_0FF9793E707ED350" MS="y">their fir&s;t di&s;covery; although we know &s;o little of their functions, there can be no doubt but that they are a nece&s;&s;ary appendage to the lymphatic &s;y&s;tem, and the di&s;covery of their u&s;e in the animal oeconomy may one day or other throw great light on &s;ome di&s;coveries, with which we are at pre&s;ent but little acquainted.</P>
<P>After having thus briefly con&s;idered the &s;tructure, di&s;tribution, and cour&s;e of the lymphatic ve&s;&s;els, I am led to make a few ob&s;ervations on their u&s;e in &s;upporting animal life.</P>
<P>The food of animals, after it is received into the &s;tomach and inte&s;tines, is &s;ubjected to the proce&s;s of dige&s;tion, and the nutritive parts thereof are con|verted into chyle. It is the office of the ab&s;orbents of the inte&s;tines or lacteals to convey the chyle thus formed into the general circulation. But this is not the only office of the lymphatics; in ca&s;e no aliment is taken into the &s;tomach, or when food taken in is not dige&s;ted, in &s;hort, where no chyle is formed in the alimentary canal, be it from whatever cau&s;e, they can &s;upport life for &s;ome time by ab&s;orbing from the atmo&s;phere, from the adipo&s;e membrane, or from any part where they meet a fluid proper for entering the general circulation. Hybernating animals afford a &s;triking example of the la&s;t mentioned power of the ab&s;orbents. The bear when he enters his cave in the autumn, is loaded with adeps, he cea&s;es to eat, no more chyle is formed in his alimentary canal, the lymphatics now begin to devour the fat which had been &s;tored up during the &s;ummer; in this manner
<PB N="9" REF="033831_0009_0FF9795321894038" MS="y">he lives as it were upon his own fle&s;h during the whole winter.</P>
<P>The lymphatic ve&s;&s;els are not equally di&s;tributed through every part of the body, &s;ome parts are endowed with a number far greater than others. The &s;mall inte&s;tines from their being the natural organs of nouri&s;hment, have perhaps a greater num|ber of ab&s;orbents &s;cattered on their &s;urface, than any other equal part of the body. The large inte&s;tines are not without the power of ab&s;orption, as will appear not only from the ca&s;e pre&s;ently to be related, but al&s;o from the reports of anatomi&s;ts. For example: In Fleming's Phy&s;iology, p. 249, we find the following di&s;&s;ection quoted from Dr. Swenke: "A &s;oldier was killed by a mu&s;ket &s;hot &s;oon after eating a plentiful meal, the bullet de&s;troyed the clavicle with the ve&s;&s;els under it, whereby the thoracic duct, near its in&s;ertion into the left &s;ubclavian was compre&s;&s;ed, and the pa&s;&s;age of chyle through it &s;topped. Upon opening the dead body, innumerable lacteals appeared through the whole extent of the colon, to its termination in the pelvis;" from this he very properly inferred the utility of nutritive enemata.</P>
<P>The de&s;criptions of the lymphatics of the large inte&s;tines which are to be found in the works of tho&s;e accurate inve&s;tigators, Ma&s;cagni and Cruik&s;hank, confirm this account of Dr. Swenke.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAPTER II.</HI> Of the Absorbing Power of the great Intestines, and the consequent Utility of Enemata.</HEAD>
<P>FROM the anatomical &s;tructure of the large inte&s;tines, we might conclude that they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed great powers of ab&s;orption, but the following facts are directly in proof of it, and &s;how the great advantages to be derived from nutritive injections into the&s;e inte&s;tines, in ca&s;es of &s;tarvation from whatever cau&s;e.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t ca&s;e to be related is one that came under my immediate in&s;pection.</P>
<P>John Fi&s;her, aged 21 years, was admitted a patient in the Alms-Hou&s;e, with a protracted inflam|matory fever, for which he took powders of nitre and calomel; in a few days his mouth was affected by the mercury, and in con&s;equence of a &s;udden application of cold, his parotid glands, neck, and face, became &s;o much &s;welled, that he was unable to take in any &s;olid food; in this &s;ituation he lived two days upon tea and mola&s;&s;es and water, but by the end of two days his mouth and throat were &s;o completely
<PB N="11" REF="033831_0011_0FF97979E6586418" MS="y">clo&s;ed that he was unable to &s;wallow any fluid. The poor man had in this time become &s;o much debilitated, from the want of nouri&s;hment and the long continuance of his di&s;ea&s;e, that he could not &s;it up in bed. At this critical moment, when every per&s;on about him expected he would breath his la&s;t in a few hours, nutritive cly&s;ters were directed to be given, and about half a pint of &s;trong beef tea with a few drops of laudanum was injected every four or five hours. In twenty four hours after the fir&s;t enema a great alteration was evident, his pul&s;e ro&s;e, and he appeared to have gained &s;trength, being able now to rai&s;e him&s;elf up in bed. By a repetition of the injections, three or four times in the day and nearly as often during the night, he was &s;upported during nine days without receiving into his &s;tomach a &s;ingle ounce of &s;olid or fluid nouri&s;hment, a &s;mall quantity of tea on the ninth day excepted; on the tenth day he &s;wallowed a quantity &s;ufficient to &s;upport him&s;elf by means of the &s;tomach. Both the mind and body of this poor patient were improved during the&s;e nine days, and by proper treatment after the omi&s;&s;ion of the enemata he perfectly recovered his health.</P>
<P>In the third volume of the London Medical Ob&s;er|vations, page 245, John Silve&s;ter relates a ca&s;e of which the following is a &s;hort extract. A girl under the effects of mercury got out of bed when very warm, and took a hearty drink of red wine, this immediately &s;topped the &s;alivation, and produced an unea&s;ine&s;s in the &s;tomach; in a week after a vomiting came on, which in a few days became ince&s;&s;ant, &s;o that &s;he threw up whatever was taken the moment
<PB N="12" REF="033831_0012_0FF979902678A200">it reached the &s;tomach. In this &s;ituation &s;he conti|nued two months, before application was made to the ho&s;pital; at this late period of her di&s;ea&s;e admittance as a patient was granted her. She was once bled, vomits, cordials, &s;tomachics, &amp;c. were all admini&s;tered without the lea&s;t alteration of di&s;ea&s;e. She was now, from debility, &s;carcely able to walk or &s;tand: at this critical moment it was thought advi&s;|able by her phy&s;icians to direct nutritive enemata, and to prohibit her from taking any thing whatever into her &s;tomach; an injection of a pint of &s;trong mutton broth with the yolk of an egg di&s;&s;olved in it, was given twice a-day. The effects of the&s;e cly&s;ters, and ab&s;tinence from eating, were, that &s;he immediately cea&s;ed to vomit, and in a few days, her &s;pirits grew better, her &s;trength increa&s;ed, and her fle&s;h grew firmer. After the injections had been continued for a fortnight, during which time &s;he neither eat nor vomited, permi&s;&s;ion was granted her to take a &s;poonful of broth, this &s;oon convinced the unfortunate patient that &s;he remained in the &s;ame unhappy &s;ituation; the enemata were therefore continued, (I am &s;orry our author does not mention for how long a time) and &s;ome medicines were like|wi&s;e admini&s;tered by way of cly&s;ter, but all without the lea&s;t mitigation of the complaint, for it was at la&s;t removed by reproducing a &s;alivation. During the whole of her di&s;ea&s;e, not excepting the time when the injections were given, &s;he had no di&s;charge downwards from the alimentary canal.</P>
<P>In the &s;econd volume of the Edinburgh Medical E&s;&s;ays, page 382, we find a very remarkable ca&s;e
<PB N="13" REF="033831_0013_0FF979A6306056A0" MS="y">recorded by James Eccles, of which I take the liberty to draw up the following abridgment. A young woman about &s;ixteen had her men&s;trual di&s;charge ob&s;tructed; this was attended with epi|leptic fits, occurring every month at the time when the men&s;es ought to have made their appearance. With a view to remove the&s;e affections, &s;he was bled and vomited; &s;oon after the operation of the &s;econd vomit &s;he was &s;eized with a difficulty of &s;wallowing, which in two or three days increa&s;ed &s;o much in violence, that &s;he was unable to &s;wallow, but on every attempt, fell into a fit, attended with prodigious tremblings and alternate di&s;tentions of the thorax and abdomen, which &s;ometimes continued half an hour, and always ended in a rigidity of the whole body. She continued without eating or drinking from the middle of May to the fifteenth of June, a period of thirty-four days, when &s;he again at|tempted to &s;wallow, but with the &s;ame bad con&s;e|quences. Anti&s;pa&s;modic and nervous medicines were now applied externally to the neck but without effect. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> probang was next re&s;orted to, and was with difficulty forced into the &s;tomach; but the operation gave temporary relief, for &s;he was able without much difficulty to &s;wallow for three weeks. By the middle of July the &s;pa&s;m had returned with &s;o much violence that the poor girl was again unable to &s;wallow, and &s;he continued fifty-four days longer without eating or drinking. During the fir&s;t cour&s;e of fa&s;ting, and the fir&s;t thirty days of the &s;econd cour&s;e, &s;he was nouri&s;hed by Enemata of broth, &s;herry wine, and the yolk of eggs. Our author ob&s;erves that this unfortunate patient declared &s;he
<PB N="14" REF="033831_0014_0FF979BD4818BD18">&s;uffered neither hunger nor thir&s;t during all the time of her fa&s;ting, that &s;he had lo&s;t but little of her fle&s;h, and that her pul&s;e was full, &s;trong, and equal.</P>
<P>The fourth ca&s;e that I &s;hall lay before the reader, is one that my worthy preceptor, Dr. Wi&s;tar, favour|ed me with; I &s;hall relate it in his own words.</P>
<P><Q>The patient was upwards of &s;ixty years of age, and very &s;edentary in her habits. The di&s;ea&s;e appeared to be &s;imple dy&s;pep&s;ia, but was aggravated in&s;tead of being relieved, by the or|dinary remedies for that complaint, and finally it increa&s;ed to &s;uch a degree, that &s;he vomited every thing &s;he &s;wallowed, and was affected with an ince&s;&s;ant nau&s;ea; debility increa&s;ed in con&s;e|quence of the&s;e &s;ymptoms &s;o much that &s;he was unable to &s;it up. Enemata with a dram of tinct. thebaic. in each, were injected to relieve the nau&s;ea, and they produced this effect, but did not enable the &s;tomach to retain what was &s;wallowed. To compen&s;ate for the want of aliment in the &s;tomach, the enemata were compo&s;ed of about eight ounces of mutton or beef broth added to the tinct. thebaic. and they were retained a long time. As the di&s;ea&s;e continued, the enemata, thus compo&s;ed, were injected daily. The bowels being extremely inactive, an injection &s;lightly &s;timulating was previou&s;ly admini&s;tered, and ge|nerally produced the di&s;charge of a &s;mall quantity of black coloured liquid foeces; an hour after the&s;e came away the anodyne nutritive injection
<PB N="15" REF="033831_0015_0FF979C9661999E0">was exhibited, and was generally retained until the &s;timulating injection was u&s;ed next day, which was about twenty-two hours afterwards. While the injection was retained &s;he lay quiet, and was not much affected with nau&s;ea, unle&s;s &s;he attempt|ed to eat or drink, but immediately after &s;wallow|ing any thing, vomiting came on, and it was computed by her attendants that &s;he always vomited much more than &s;he &s;wallowed; the matter di&s;charged appeared to be the aliment recently taken, mixed with the ga&s;tric fluids and mucus. In this &s;tate, vomiting more than &s;he &s;wallowed, &s;he continued upwards of &s;ix weeks, when the nau&s;ea went off gradually, and her appetite and power of retaining food returned; with this al&s;o returned her &s;trength, which increa&s;ed to a degree greater than u&s;ual, and continued &s;everal years, when &s;imilar complaints returned, while &s;he was in the country, where the enemata could not be admini&s;tered; &s;he died after a lingering illne&s;s, during which &s;he fre|quently expre&s;&s;ed her wi&s;hes for her former remedy.</Q></P>
<P>I am &s;orry that my experience as a &s;tudent has not afforded me more facts of a &s;imilar nature, but I flatter my&s;elf that the preceding ca&s;es, though few in number, are &s;ufficient to convince-any mind of the great power of ab&s;orption in the colon, and of the great utility of nutritive enemata in ca&s;es of di&s;ea&s;e in the dige&s;tive organs, or in the organs of deglutition.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="033831_0016_0FF979DF59C1C7D0" MS="y">
In every ca&s;e where a &s;ufficient quantity of food cannot be received into the &s;tomach without the aggravation of di&s;ea&s;e, when the patient is altoge|ther unable to &s;wallow, or in ca&s;es where food received into the &s;tomach is not dige&s;ted, or is immediately thrown up; we ought never to neglect giving our patient the opportunity of recovering by the&s;e means. Though we cannot always cure the di&s;ea&s;e, yet we may revive and &s;upport our patient until the remedies proper for the cure of his complaint can be employed with advantage. Of the three patients mentioned that were cured, I will venture to &s;ay there is not one who would not have died before the remedies, employed to cure the different di&s;ea&s;es, could have been effectually admini&s;tered; it is had not been for the great a&s;&s;i&s;tance they derived from the nutritive enemata.</P>
<P>The la&s;t of the four ca&s;es is doubly intere&s;ting, Fir&s;t, for the length of time the patient was &s;upported by the injection; and, &s;econdly, for the perfect cure performed by the re&s;t afforded the &s;tomach. This leads me again to recommend the u&s;e of nutritive cly&s;ters to the practitioner of medicine, under certain circum&s;tances, and in certain di&s;ea&s;es; particularly in violent dy&s;pep&s;ia, which &s;o often baffles the efforts of phy&s;icians.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAPTER III.</HI> Of the Sympathetic Connections of the Great Intestines.</HEAD>
<P>HITHERTO I have been con&s;idering the power of ab&s;orption; my intention now is to offer a few ob&s;ervations, on another important quality of the animal body, by which medicines act on the whole &s;y&s;tem although applied locally, I mean &s;ympathy. By this term we under&s;tand the di&s;po&s;ition in one part, to be affected by an application, to another, perhaps remotely &s;ituated from it; for example, an irritation excited in the no&s;e will throw the diaphragm into violent contractions; irritation at the neck of the bladder, by a &s;tone, produces pain at the glans penis.</P>
<P>Upon what principle, or by what means, this wonderful con&s;ent of parts exi&s;ts, has hitherto been inexplicable, and will remain &s;o until we are better acquainted with the brain and nervous &s;y&s;tem. The &s;tronge&s;t example of &s;ympathy or nervous connection afforded us, exi&s;ts between the &s;tomach; and the whole
<PB N="18" REF="033831_0018_0FF978BC3B1142F8" MS="y">body; the connection here is &s;o &s;trong, that a draught of cold water, on a hot &s;ummers day, has de&s;troyed life in a few minutes, a blow on the pit of the &s;tomach has induced &s;yncope and even death. It is by means of this great &s;ympathy that many medicines act on the general &s;y&s;tem when received into the &s;tomach, particularly tho&s;e of the narcotic and &s;timulating kind.</P>
<P>That the large inte&s;tines re&s;emble the &s;tomach in their &s;ympathetic connection is evident from the &s;imilarity of effects, produced by the operation of the &s;ame medicines in the &s;tomach and rectum. It has long been known that bark, injected into the rectum, will cure an intermittent, and the daily u&s;e of opium, in this way, attended with the &s;ame effects as when taken into the &s;tomach, goes far to demon&s;trate the &s;ympathy that exi&s;ts between the rectum and general &s;y&s;tem. The relation of an experiment made on my&s;elf, will convince the reader of the powerful effects of opium when received by enema.</P>
<P>At a quarter before 10 o'clock, P. M. pul&s;e beating 52 <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">My pul&s;e in health beats 52.</NOTE> &s;trokes in a minute, I took an injection of 180 drops of laudanum diluted with two ounces of water; in 15 minutes my pul&s;e was the &s;ame with regard to frequency, but rather fuller; in 25 minutes it con|tinued the &s;ame with a &s;light giddine&s;s of the head; in 35 minutes it rai&s;ed to 56, but was &s;maller and harder; in 45 minutes, pul&s;e 56, the affection of the
<PB N="19" REF="033831_0019_0FF97A130F4558F8" MS="y">head re&s;embled that &s;en&s;ation which is felt at the approach of intoxication; 60 minutes, pul&s;e 56, the affection of the head continued; 70 minutes, pul&s;e 72, &s;mall but ten&s;e, eyes &s;omewhat turgid, more languor, and much inclined to a recumbent po&s;ture: in the next ten minutes my pul&s;e fell from 72 to 60 &s;trokes in a minute, langour much increa&s;ed. I now re&s;olved to go to bed; previous to doing this, I di&s;|charged what I &s;uppo&s;ed to be the whole of the injection without any foeces.</P>
<P>At half pa&s;t eleven o'clock, A. M. I injected &s;even drams of wine into the rectum of a &s;mall dog; at 12 o'clock, no &s;en&s;ible effects being produced, nor the fir&s;t injection di&s;charged, I admini&s;tered &s;even drams more; in five minutes after the la&s;t injection, he began to move his hind legs with difficulty, and great uncertainty, when attempting to jump he was &s;ure to fall; in a few minutes more he was &s;carcely able to walk, falling frequently and running again&s;t every thing that came in his way. In fifteen minutes after the la&s;t injection, he had a large di&s;charge from the rectum, immediately after which the effects began gradually to di&s;appear.</P>
<P>In this manner I intoxicated the &s;ame dog a number of different times.</P>
<P>At &s;everal different times I had &s;mall quantities of wine injected into my rectum. While under one of the&s;e experiments, and the only one at which I examined my pul&s;e, I found it to be rai&s;ed &s;everal &s;trokes in a minute; but the quantity that I could
<PB N="20" REF="033831_0020_0FF97A2849BC1890">retain was too &s;mall to produce any very obvious effect while my body and mind were in perfect health; but I am fully convinced that wine may be injected into the rectum with advantage in ca&s;es of great debility. I will here take the liberty of mention|ing, in as few words as po&s;&s;ible, a ca&s;e delivered by Dr. Wi&s;tar in his cour&s;e of Lectures on Anatomy, which in a remarkable manner points out the &s;imilarity of effects produced in the &s;tomach and rectum by &s;piritous liquors. The &s;ubject of this ca&s;e was a man much addicted to the u&s;e of &s;trong drink, and pro|bably from this cau&s;e was tempted to cut his throat, which he one day effected; while he laboured under the wound, it was with great difficulty that any thing could be &s;wallowed. His phy&s;ician, the late Dr. Way of this city, who&s;e death is ever to be lamented, directed nutritive enemata, and the&s;e an&s;wered the purpo&s;e of aliment; but the poor patient &s;oon found that he &s;uffered materially from the want of the diffu&s;ible &s;timulus, and one day, when his wife was about giving him an injection, he de&s;ired her to add &s;ome ardent &s;pirits to the nutritive matter; the effect &s;oon convinced him that he derived every benefit from the &s;pirit in this way, that he was accu&s;tomed to do when he drank it; and after this di&s;covery, he did not let a &s;ingle day pa&s;s without taking &s;everal do&s;es.</P>
<P>The&s;e experiments, in conjunction with daily expe|rience, can leave no doubt of the great advantages to be derived on certain occa&s;ions from the admini|&s;tration of medicines, particularly tho&s;e of a narcotic &s;timulating quality, by enemata.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="033831_0021_0FF97A434A4E1790">
I cannot &s;ay from experiment, but I think analogy warrants me in &s;o doing, that every medicine, the effects of which are communicated to the general &s;y&s;tem by the &s;ympathetic connection of the &s;tomach, will have a &s;imilar effect when thrown up the rectum provided the do&s;e is proportionably large.</P>
<P>The relative do&s;e for the rectum, has by &s;ome been computed to be two thirds larger than that for the &s;tomach, but from experiment I am led to believe that it does not require &s;o much. On comparing the effects of &s;ixty drops of tinct. thebaic. in the &s;tomach, with tho&s;e produced by one hundred and eighty drops in the rectum, I found that the effects of the latter were &s;omething &s;tronger than tho&s;e of the former. This I think ju&s;tifies me in concluding, that the relative do&s;e for the rectum does not require to be two thirds larger, but that little more than a double do&s;e will an&s;wer the &s;ame intentions in the inte&s;tines.</P>
<P>Having thus &s;atisfied my&s;elf of the &s;ympathetic connection between the rectum and general &s;y&s;tem; I was induced to try whether any particular &s;ympathy exi&s;ted between the &s;tomach and large inte&s;tines: the mode that &s;truck me as be&s;t calculated to a&s;certain this point, was the injection of emetic medicines; I made a number of experiments with tart. emetic, and &s;everal with ipecac. a few of which I &s;hall now proceed to relate.</P>
<P>After having u&s;ed as much as eight grains of the emetic tart. by enema, without the lea&s;t affection of
<PB N="22" REF="033831_0022_0FF97A4E77150360" MS="y">the &s;tomach, I was induced to think that a &s;till larger quantity might produce &s;ome effect, and I ventured on taking thirteen grains; this was injected at half pa&s;t eleven o'clock, A. M. di&s;&s;olved in two ounces of water, immediately after I had perfectly evacuated my rectum. This on being fir&s;t thrown up produced &s;ome irritation, but it did not continue longer than five minutes. Not the &s;lighte&s;t affection of the &s;tomach was ob&s;ervable, from the time it was injected, until it was di&s;charged, which was at ten o'clock, P. M. of the &s;ame day. In the act of evacuating, I had &s;ome tene&s;mus, and a little &s;orene&s;s at the verge of the anus, but of this I felt nothing ten minutes after. So inactive was the tart. emetic upon this part, that it did not even excite a di&s;charge of foeces, nor produce the lea&s;t effect on the general &s;y&s;tem that was ob&s;ervable.</P>
<P>From the great irritation produced in the rectum by injections of ipecac, I did not venture to increa&s;e the do&s;e beyond half a dram; this quantity was admini&s;tered one afternoon at half pa&s;t four o'clock, mixed with two ounces of warm water, and was not di&s;charged until nine o'clock, A. M. the next day. In the intermediate time, no effects of any kind were ob&s;ervable either on the &s;tomach or general &s;y&s;tem, but at four in the afternoon I had another very &s;mall di&s;charge, which was attended with con&s;iderable &s;training, and from this time I had almo&s;t a conti|nued de&s;ire to evacuate from the rectum; in two or three hours went to &s;tool three or four times, and the&s;e di&s;charges, though very &s;mall, were all attended
<PB N="23" REF="033831_0023_0FF97A69247FA890" MS="y">with tene&s;mus; between the&s;e evacuations I was not free from unea&s;ine&s;s, but felt a con&s;iderable throbbing about the verge of the anus, &s;imilar to that experienced in a phlegmon. Would not an injection of this kind &s;erve to bring on the haemor|rhoidal flux?</P>
<P>From the two la&s;t mentioned experiments, and &s;everal others of a &s;imilar nature not related; I conclude that there is no &s;pecific connection between the &s;tomach and rectum, and that little can be expected from enemata in exciting the action of the &s;tomach, without it is in con&s;equence of their effect upon the general &s;y&s;tem.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAPTER IV.</HI> On the Application of Medicines to the External Surface.</HEAD>
<P>THE utility to be derived from the appli|cation of medicines to different parts of the body, mu&s;t forcibly &s;trike every mind, upon con&s;idering how often we are prevented from applying them with effect through the medium of the alimentary canal by its many di&s;ea&s;es; and the great di&s;po&s;ition there is in the different parts of the animal body to become habituated to the action of medicines applied imme|diately to them. It is a fact well known, that when one part has become accu&s;tomed to the action of a medicine, we may apply it to another with every advantage; for in&s;tance, when the &s;tomach, from a long continued u&s;e, has become as it were paralytic to the powers of opium, the rectum will receive its impre&s;&s;ions as forcibly as though it never had been applied to any part of the body. This fact is further corroborated by a very &s;imple experiment. Any per&s;on in the habit of u&s;ing tobacco, and who has always been accu&s;tomed to hold the chew on one
<PB N="25" REF="033831_0025_0FF97A84C781C0C0" MS="y">&s;ide only, will by removing it to the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the mouth, experience the &s;ame di&s;agreeable effects that he did on his fir&s;t commencing the u&s;e of this plant.</P>
<P>In the preceding pages I have con&s;idered the rectum as an advantageous part for the application of nou|ri&s;hment and medicine, when the &s;tomach, mouth, or oe&s;ophagus are di&s;ea&s;ed. In ca&s;es where we wi&s;h further to a&s;&s;i&s;t the operation of medicines in the &s;tomach and rectum, or where both the&s;e organs are di&s;ea&s;ed; a good opportunity is afforded us by the external &s;urface of the body.</P>
<P>Medicines applied to the &s;kin act on the two prin|ciples &s;poken of, namely, ab&s;orption and nervous &s;ympathy. That the fir&s;t of the&s;e powers is &s;eated in the &s;kin, is evident, by e&s;&s;ential oils having been ta&s;ted in the mouth, a &s;hort time after they were rubbed on &s;ome part of the &s;kin; by the external u&s;e of terebinthinates, by the daily introduction of mercury into the &s;y&s;tem in this way, and by the ab&s;orption of many poi&s;ons from the external &s;urface; the bark, bath, and jacket have al&s;o been found of &s;ervice in intermittents, and the&s;e probably act as much through the medium of the nerves as of the ob&s;orbents.</P>
<P>In the memoirs of the medical &s;ociety of London, we find a letter from Mr. Sherwen to Dr. Lett&s;om on the external ab&s;orption of tartar emetic. In this communication the author ob&s;erves, nau&s;ea, great per&s;piration, gentle purging, an increa&s;ed flow of
<PB N="26" REF="033831_0026_0FF97A9A3A247DB0" MS="y">urine, and in one ca&s;e an eruption with an itching of the &s;kin, as the effects of from five to ten grains (which is the large&s;t do&s;e he there mentions having u&s;ed) of tart. emet. when ab&s;orbed by rubbing it on the hands, and in one in&s;tance, on the &s;ide and region of the &s;tomach.</P>
<P>It might be thought pre&s;umption in me to con|tradict &s;o re&s;pectable an author as Mr. Sherwen; this I will avoid doing, but &s;hall relate &s;ome expe|riments &s;imilar to Mr. Sherwen's, with their re&s;ults, and leave the unprejudiced reader to judge for him&s;elf.</P>
<P>At &s;everal different times, I rubbed 12 grains of tart. emet. moi&s;tened with a &s;mall quantity of water into the palms of my hands; this was done in the evening a &s;hort time before going to bed. I &s;lept &s;ound as u&s;ual all night, without experiencing the lea&s;t nau&s;ea, per&s;piration, or purgative effects, either during the night or next day, but ro&s;e and eat my breakfa&s;t with my accu&s;tomed good appetite. At my de&s;ire, a fellow-graduate repeated the experi|ment ju&s;t related, without experiencing any &s;en&s;ible effects from the medicine.</P>
<P>The following experiment was made by a fellow &s;tudent. At 8 o'clock, P. M. he rubbed 12 grains of tart. emet. with the addition of two drams of water, into the palms of his hands; in half an hour after, the fir&s;t 12 grains having produced no effects, 12 grains more were admini&s;tered in the &s;ame man|ner. No effects were ob&s;ervable in three hours
<PB N="27" REF="033831_0027_0FF97AB0AD4A2978" MS="y">after, when he retired to bed. About &s;ix o'clock next morning a moi&s;ture of the &s;kin was ob&s;ervable; this the gentleman was inclined to attribute more to his having &s;lept under an unu&s;ual quantity of bed clothes, than to the medicine. No nau&s;ea, purging, or eruption followed.</P>
<P>Two &s;cruples of tart. emet. made into a pa&s;te with a little water, and kept applied to the pit of the &s;tomach for 12 hours, produced no di&s;coverable operation.</P>
<P>Peter V&mdash;, afflicted with chronic rheumati&s;m, rubbed a table &s;poonful of a &s;aturated &s;olution of tart. emet. in water into his knee and thigh; this he continued to do every night, for a week, without its once nau&s;eating, or &s;weating him. He thought the medicine purged him &s;lightly the &s;econd morning after he commenced the u&s;e of it; this effect was not ob&s;erved at any other time during the whole cour&s;e. The complaint of this patient was not relieved by this remedy.</P>
<P>Catharine G&mdash; was troubled with rheumati&s;m and a &s;welling of her &s;tomach; I ordered her to rub a table &s;poonful of a &s;aturated &s;olution of tart. emet. in water on her thigh and &s;tomach; this was done the fir&s;t night; the next day I reque&s;ted her to u&s;e two table &s;poonfuls, this do&s;e &s;he continued to u&s;e every evening, for five or &s;ix times. This woman was &s;everal times nau&s;eated; &s;he per&s;pired, though not when the medicine could have produced it, but
<PB N="28" REF="033831_0028_0FF97AC3843E9410" MS="y">when &s;he was rubbing her&s;elf, which was always done before a warm &s;tove; an eruption appeared, not over the whole body, but merely on tho&s;e parts where &s;he u&s;ed the friction, which I attributed to the mechanical irritation produced on the tender &s;kin of the thigh by &s;ome undi&s;&s;olved particle of tart. emet.</P>
<P>Molly C&mdash;, &s;ubject to a chronic head-ache and &s;ome unea&s;ine&s;s at her &s;tomach, rubbed a table-&s;poonful of the &s;ame &s;olution over her abdomen every evening for five or &s;ix days, without ob&s;erving any of the effects a&s;cribed to this medicine.</P>
<P>Mr. Sherwen inculcates the above as a good mode of admini&s;tering antimonials, when we wi&s;h them to act on the general &s;y&s;tem, and not particularly on the alimentary canal. That a long and continued u&s;e of tart. emet. in this way would materially affect the &s;y&s;tem, I have no manner of doubt; but of operations produced by a &s;ingle or &s;everal do&s;es, the reader will judge from the above experiments.</P>
<P>In ca&s;es of ab&s;tinence from aliment and drink, where great thir&s;t occurs, relief may be afforded almo&s;t immediately by immer&s;ing the patient in warm water. Sailors frequently experience the happie&s;t effects from bathing, when they are in want of water. It is on the principle of ab&s;orption from the &s;kin, that the inoculation of the &s;mall-pox is founded; this di&s;covery has afforded more happine&s;s to mankind than any made &s;ince the time of Harvey, and is alone
<PB N="29" REF="033831_0029_0FF8DC888DAC0FA0" MS="y">&s;ufficient to make us contemplate with plea&s;ure, the advantages that may be derived from operations produced on the general &s;y&s;tem through this channel.</P>
<P>The nervous con&s;ent exi&s;ting between the &s;kin and general &s;y&s;tem, is by no means &s;mall, as is ob&s;ervable from the action of &s;ome &s;ub&s;tances when applied to this part. I have &s;een a leaf of tobacco applied to the cheek of a per&s;on not accu&s;tomed to the u&s;e of this plant, produce violent vomiting, and purging, and general effects &s;o powerful as nearly to induce &s;yncope.</P>
<P>Opiates may be employed with evident benefit in this way, as I have frequently ob&s;erved where opium made into a pla&s;ter with a little con&s;erve of ro&s;es has been applied to the pit of the &s;tomach, in &s;pa&s;ms of that organ, cholera infantum, and vomitings; it relieves the unea&s;ine&s;s at the &s;tomach, and has a tendency to cheek the diarrhoea.</P>
<P>One dram of finely powdered opium made into a pa&s;te with liquid laudanum, and applied to the pit of the &s;tomach of an adult, produced effects &s;o &s;trong, that the &s;ubject, a woman of a habit rather delicate, was unable to keep out of bed.</P>
<P>Volat alkali applied to the temples and internal membrane of the no&s;e in &s;yncope, furni&s;hes another proof of the &s;udden and powerful operations that may be produced on the &s;y&s;tem, by the application
<PB N="30" REF="033831_0030_0FF97AE10151A198">of different medicines to the &s;urface; bli&s;ters, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word">, cau&s;tics, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word">, all act in part by means of a &s;ympathetic connection.</P>
