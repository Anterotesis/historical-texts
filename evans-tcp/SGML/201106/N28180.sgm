<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE Author knows not whether it be ne|cessary to apologize for the extraordinary length of this Sermon, which &s;o much exceeds the usual limits of public discourses; for it is only for the Reader to conceive, (by a fiction of the imagina|tion, if he pleases so to consider it,) that the pa|tience of the Audience indulged him with their attention during its delivery. The fact is, not being in the habit of writing his sermons, this discourse was not committed to paper till after it was delivered; so that the phraseology may probably vary, and the bulk be somewhat ex|tended; but the substance is certainly retained.</P>
<P>He mu&s;t crave the indulgence of the Religi|ous Public for having blended so little <HI>theology</HI> with it. He is fully aware, the chief attention of a Christian Minister should be occupied in explaining the doctrines, and enforcing the du|ties, of genuine Christianity; nor is he charge|able, he hopes, in the exercise of his public func|tions, with any remarkable deviation from that rule of conduct; yet is he equally convinced, ex|cursions into other topics are sometimes both lawful and necessary. The versality of error de|mands a correspondent variety in the methods
<PB N="iv" REF="037564_0003_100EDC83472CB350">of defending truth: and from whom have the public more right to expect its defence, in oppo|sition to the encroachment of error and Infideli|ty, than from tho&s;e who profess to devote their studies and their lives to the advancement of virtue and Religion? Accordingly, a multitude of publications on these subjects equally power|ful in argument, and impressive in manner, have issued from Divines of different persuasions, which must be allowed to have done the utmo&s;t honor to the clerical profession. The most lu|minous statements of the evidences of Christi|anity, on historical grounds, have been made; the petulant cavils of Infidels satisfactorily refut|ed; and their ignorance, if not put to shame, at least amply exposed; so that Revelation, as far as truth and reason can prevail, is on all sides triumphant.</P>
<P>There is one point of view, however, in which the respective systems remain to be examined, which, though hitherto little considered, is forc|ed upon our attention by the present conduct of our adversaries; that is, their <HI>Influence on So|ciety.</HI> The controversy appears to have taken a new turn. The advocates of Infidelity, baffled in the field of argument, though unwilling to re|linquish the contest, have changed their mode of attack, and seem less disposed to impugn the au|thority than to supersede the use of Revealed Religion, by giving such representations of man and of society as are calculated to make its sanc|tions appear unreasonable and unnecessary. Their aim is not so much to discredit the pretensions
<PB N="v" REF="037564_0004_100EDC8552B4E508">of any particular Religion, as to set aside the principles common to all.</P>
<P>To obliterate the sense of Deity, of moral sanc|tions, and a future world, and by these means to prepare the way for the total subver&s;ion of every institution, both social and religious, which men have been hitherto accustomed to revere, is evidently the principal object of mo|dern Sceptics; the fir&s;t Sophi&s;ts who have avow|ed an attempt to govern the world without in|culcating the persuasion of a superior power. It might well excite our surprise, to behold an effort to shake off the yoke of Religion, which was to|tally unknown during the prevalence of gross superstition, reserved for a period of the world distinguished from every other by the possession of a Revelation more pure, perfect and better authenticated, than the enlightened sages of an|tiquity ever ventured to anticipate, were we not fully persuaded the immaculate holine&s;s of this Revelation is precisely that which renders it di&s;|gusting to men who are determined at all events to retain their vices. Our Saviour furnishes the Solution; <HI>they love darkness rather than light, be|cause their deeds are evil; neither will they come to the light lest their deeds should be reproved.</HI></P>
<P>While all the Religions, the Jewish excepted, which, previous to the promulgation of Christi|anity, prevailed in the world, partly the contri|vance of human policy, partly the offspring of ignorant fear, mixed with the mutilated re|mains of traditionary revelation, were favorable to the indulgence of some vices, and but feebly
<PB N="vi" REF="037564_0005_100EDC86F674A4B0">restrained the practice of others; betwixt vice of every sort and in every degree, and the Reli|gion of Jesus, there subsists an irreconcileable enmity, an eternal discord. The dominion of Chri&s;tianity being, in the very essence of it, the dominion of virtue, we need look no farther for the sources of hostility in any who oppose it, than their attachment to vice and disorder.</P>
<P>This view of the controversy, if it be just, demon&s;trates its supreme importance, and fur|nishes the strongest plea with every one with whom it is not a matter of indifference whether vice or virtue, delusion or truth, govern the world, to exert his talents in whatever propor|tion they are possessed, in <HI>contending earnestly for the faith once delivered to the saints.</HI> In such a crisis, is it not best for Christians of all denominations, that they may better concentrate their forces again&s;t the common adversary, to suspend for the present their internal disputes, imitating the policy of wise states, who have never failed to consider the invasion of an enemy as the signal for terminating the contests of party? Internal peace is the best fruit we can reap from external danger. The momentous contest at issue be|twixt the Christian Church and Infidels, may instruct us how trivial, for the most part, are the controver&s;ies of its members with each other, and that the different ceremonies, opinions and practices, by which they are distinguished, cor|respond to the variety of feature and complex|ion, discernible in the offspring of the same Pa|rent, among whom there subsists the greatest fa|mily
<PB N="vii" REF="037564_0006_100EDC88F0CD6880">likene&s;s. May it please God so to dispose the minds of Christians of every visible church and community, <HI>that Ephraim no longer vexing Ju|dah, nor Judah Ephraim,</HI> the only rivalry felt in future may be, who shall most advance the in|terests of our common Christianity, and the only provocation sustained, <HI>that of provoking each other to love and good works!</HI> When, at the distance of more than half a century, Christianity was as|saulted, by a <HI>Woolston,</HI> a <HI>Tindal</HI> and a <HI>Morgan,</HI> it was ably supported both by Clergymen of the Established Church, and writers among Protes|tant Dissenters; the labours of a <HI>Clarke</HI> and a <HI>Butler,</HI> were associated with those of a <HI>Dod|dridge,</HI> a <HI>Leland</HI> and a <HI>Lardner,</HI> with such equal reputation and success, as to make it evident that the intrinsic excellence of Religion needs not the aid of external appendages; but that, with or without a dowry, her charms are of sufficient power to fix and engage the heart.</P>
<P>The writer of this discourse will feel himself happy, should his example stimulate any of his brethren, of &s;uperior abilities, to contribute their exertions in so good a cause. His apology for not entering more at large, into the proofs of the being of a God,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See an excellent Sermon on Atheism, by the Rev. Mr. <HI>Estlin, of Bristol,</HI> at whose meeting the sub|stance of this discourse was first preached. In the ser|mon referred to, the argument for the existence of a Deity, is stated with the utmost clearness and precision, and the sophistry of <HI>Dupuis,</HI> a French Infidel, refuted in a very satisfactory manner.</NOTE> and the evidences of Christian|ity<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">It is almost superfluous to name a work so univer|sally known as Dr. <HI>Paley's View of the Evidences of Christianity,</HI> which is, probably, without exception, the most clear and satisfactory statement of the Historical proofs of the Christian Religion, ever exhibited in any age or country.</NOTE>,
<PB N="viii" REF="037564_0007_100EDC8ABA4655C0">is, that these subjects have been already han|dled with great ability by various writers, and that he wished rather to confine himself to one view of the subject, the total incompatibility of Sceptical principles with the existence of Society. Should his life be spared, he may probably, at &s;ome future time, enter into a fuller and more particular examination of the Infidel Philo&s;ophy, both with respect to its speculative principles, and its practical effects; its influence on Society and on the individual. In the mean time, he humbly consecrates this discourse to the honour of that Saviour, who, when the means of a more liberal offering are wanting, commends the wi|dow's mite.</P>

<HEAD>A SERMON ON EPHESIANS ii. 12.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Without God in the world.</HEAD>
<P>AS the Chri&s;tian mini&s;try is e&s;tabli&s;hed for the in|&s;truction of men, throughout every age, in truth and ho|liene&s;s, it mu&s;t adapt it&s;elf to the ever &s;hifting &s;cenes of the moral world, and &s;tand ready to repel the attacks of impiety and error, under whatever form they may appear. The church and the world form two &s;ocieties &s;o di&s;tinct, and governed by &s;uch oppo&s;ite principles and maxims, that, as well from this contrariety as from the expre&s;s warnings of &s;cripture, true Chri&s;tians mu&s;t look for a &s;tate of warfare, with this con&s;oling a&s;&s;urance, that the Church, like the burning bu&s;h be|held by Mo&s;es in the land of Midian, may be encom|pa&s;&s;ed with flames, but will never be con&s;umed.</P>
<P>When &s;he was delivered from the per&s;ecuting power of Rome, &s;he only experienced a change of trials. The oppre&s;&s;ion of external violence was followed by the more dangerous and in&s;idious attacks of internal enemies. The freedom of enquiry claimed and a&s;|&s;erted at the reformation, degenerated, in the hands of men who profe&s;&s;ed the principles without po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the &s;pirit of the reformers, into a fondne&s;s for &s;pecu|lative refinements, and con&s;equently into a &s;ource of
<PB N="12" REF="037564_0010_100EDC90F3B0A2B0">di&s;pute, faction and here&s;y. While prote&s;tants attend|ed more to the points on which they differed, than to tho&s;e in which they agreed, while more zeal was em|ployed in &s;ettling ceremonies and defending &s;ubtleties, than in enforcing plain and revealed truths, the lovely fruits of peace and charity peri&s;hed under the &s;torms of controver&s;y</P>
<P>In this disjointed, and di&s;ordered &s;tate of the Chri&s;|tian church, they who never looked into the interior of Chri&s;tianity were apt to &s;u&s;pect, that to a &s;ubject &s;o fruitful in particular di&s;putes, mu&s;t attach a general un|certainty, and that a religion founded on revelation, could never have occa&s;ioned &s;uch di&s;cordancy of prin|ciple and practice among&s;t its di&s;ciples. Thus infi|delity is the joint offspring of an irreligious temper and unholy &s;peculation, employed, not in examining the evidences of Chri&s;tianity, but in detecting the vices and imperfections of profe&s;&s;ing Chri&s;tians. It has pa&s;&s;ed through various &s;tages, each di&s;tingui&s;hed by higher gradations of impiety; for, when men arro|gantly abandon their guide, and wilfully &s;hut their eyes on the light of Heaven, it is wi&s;ely ordained that their errors &s;hall multiply at every &s;tep, until their extrava|gance confutes it&s;elf, and the mi&s;chief of their princi|ples works its own antidote. That &s;uch has been the progre&s;s of infidelity will be obvious from a &s;light &s;ur|vey of its hi&s;tory:</P>
<P>Lord <HI>Herbert,</HI> the fir&s;t and pure&s;t of our Engli&s;h free-thinkers, who flouri&s;hed in the beginning of the reign of Charles the fir&s;t, did not &s;o much impugn the doctrine or the morality of the &s;criptures, as attempt to &s;uper&s;ede their nece&s;&s;ity, by endeavouring to &s;hew, that the great principles of the unity of God, a moral government, and a future world, are taught with &s;uf|ficient clearne&s;s by the light of nature. <HI>Bolingbroke</HI> and others of his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, advanced much farther, and attempted to invalidate the proofs of the moral character of the Deity, and con&s;equently all expecta|tions
<PB N="13" REF="037564_0011_100EDC92D0B17BB8">of rewards and puni&s;hments, leaving the Su|preme Being no other perfections than tho&s;e which belong to a fir&s;t cau&s;e or Almighty contriver. After him, at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance, followed <HI>Hume,</HI> the mo&s;t &s;ubtle, if not the mo&s;t philo&s;ophical of the dei&s;ts, who, by perplexing the relations of cau&s;e and effect, boldly aimed to introduce an univer&s;al &s;ceptici&s;m, and to pour a more than Egyptian darkne&s;s into the whole region of morals. Since his time, &s;ceptical writers have &s;prung up in abundance, and infidelity has allured multitudes to its &s;tandard; the young and &s;uperficial by its dexterous &s;ophi&s;try, the vain by the literary fame of its champions, and the profligate by the licentiou&s;|ne&s;s of its principles. Athei&s;m, the mo&s;t undi&s;gui&s;ed, has, at length, begun to make its appearance.</P>
<P>Animated by numbers and emboldened by &s;ucce&s;s, the infidels of the pre&s;ent day have given a new direc|tion to their efforts, and impre&s;&s;ed a new character on the ever growing ma&s;s of their impious &s;peculations.</P>
<P>By uniting more clo&s;ely with each other, by giving a &s;prinkling of religion to all their literary productions they aim to engro&s;s the formation of the public mind, and, amid&s;t the warme&s;t profe&s;&s;ions of attachment to virtue, to effect an entire di&s;ruption of morality from religion. Pretending to be the teachers of virtue and the guides of life, they propo&s;e to revolutionize the morals of mankind, to regenerate the world by a pro|ce&s;s entirely new, and to rear the temple of virtue, not merely without the aid of religion, but on the renun|ciation of its principles and the deri&s;ion of its &s;anctions. Their party has derived a great acce&s;&s;ion of numbers and &s;trength, from events the mo&s;t momentous and a&s;toni&s;hing in the political world, which have divided the &s;entiments of Europe betwixt hope and terror, and, however they may i&s;&s;ue, have, for the pre&s;ent, &s;welled the ranks of infidelity. So rapidly, indeed, has it advanced &s;ince this cri&s;is, that a great majority on the continent, and in England a con&s;iderable propor|tion,
<PB N="14" REF="037564_0012_100EDC94C0250490">of tho&s;e who pur&s;ue literature as a profe&s;&s;ion,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">By tho&s;e who pur&s;ue literature as a profe&s;&s;ion, the Author would be under&s;tood to mean that numerous cla&s;s of literary men who draw their principal &s;ub&s;i&s;tence from their writings.</NOTE> may ju&s;tly be con&s;idered as the open or di&s;gui&s;ed abet|tors of Athei&s;m.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the &s;ceptical and religious &s;y&s;tems, the inquiry at pre&s;ent is not &s;o much which is the true&s;t in &s;peculation, as which is the mo&s;t u&s;eful in practice; or, in other words, whether morality will be be&s;t pro|moted, by con&s;idering it as part of a great and compre|hen&s;ive law, emanating from the will of a &s;upreme, om|nipotent legi&s;lator; or as a mere expedient adapted to our pre&s;ent &s;ituation, enforced by no other motives than tho&s;e which ari&s;e from the pro&s;pects and intere&s;ts of the pre&s;ent &s;tate. The <HI>absurdity</HI> of Athei&s;m having been demon&s;trated &s;o often and &s;o clearly by many eminent men, that this part of the &s;ubject is exhau&s;ted, I &s;hould ha&s;ten immediately to what I have more particularly in view, were I not apprehen&s;ive a di&s;cour&s;e of this kind may be expected to contain &s;ome &s;tatement of the argument in proof of a Deity, which, therefore, I &s;hall pre&s;ent in as few and plain words as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>When we examine a watch, or any other piece of machinery, we in&s;tantly perceive marks of de&s;ign. The arrangement of its &s;everal parts and the adaption of its movements to one re&s;ult, &s;hew it to be a contrivance; nor do we ever imagine the faculty of contriving to be in the watch it&s;elf, but in a &s;eparate agent. If we turn from art to nature, we behold a va&s;t magazine of contri|vances, we &s;ee innumerable objects replete with the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite de&s;ign. The human eye, for example, is formed, with admirable &s;kill for the purpo&s;e of &s;ight; the ear for the function of hearing. As in the pro|ductions of art, we never think of a&s;cribing the power of contrivance to the machine it&s;elf, &s;o we are certain
<PB N="15" REF="037564_0013_100EDC969FF66368">the &s;kill di&s;played in the human &s;tructure is not a pro|perty of man, &s;ince he is very imperfectly acquainted with his own formation. If there be an in&s;eparable re|lation betwixt the ideas of a contrivance and a contriver, and it be evident in regard to the human &s;tructure the de&s;igning agent is not man him&s;elf, there mu&s;t undenia|bly be &s;ome &s;eparate invi&s;ible Being who is his former. This great Being we mean to indicate by the appella|tion of Deity.</P>
<P>This rea&s;oning admits of but one reply. Why, it will be &s;aid, may we not &s;uppo&s;e the world has always continued as it is; that is, that there has been a con&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of finite beings, appearing and di&s;appearing on the earth from all eternity? I an&s;wer, whatever is &s;uppo&s;ed to have occa&s;ioned this con&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, ex|clu&s;ive of an intelligent cau&s;e, will never account for the undeniable marks of de&s;ign, vi&s;ible in all finite Beings; nor is the ab&s;urdity of &s;uppo&s;ing a contrivance without a contriver dimini&s;hed by this imaginary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, but rather increa&s;ed by being repeated at every &s;tep of the &s;eries.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, an eternal &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of finite beings involves in it a contradiction, and is, therefore, plainly impo&s;&s;i|ble. As the &s;uppo&s;ition is made to get quit of the idea of any one having exi&s;ted from eternity, each of the beings in the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion mu&s;t have begun in time; but the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion it&s;elf is eternal. We have then a &s;ucce&s;|&s;ion of beings infinitely earlier than any being in the &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion; or, in other words, a &s;eries of beings running on <HI>ad infinitum,</HI> before it reached any particular being; which is ab&s;urd.</P>
<P>From the&s;e con&s;iderations, it is manife&s;t there mu&s;t be &s;ome eternal Being, or nothing could ever have ex|i&s;ted; and &s;ince the beings which we behold, bear in their whole &s;tructure evident marks of wi&s;dom and de|&s;ign, it is equally certain that he who formed them is a wi&s;e and intelligent agent.</P>
<P>To prove the unity of this great Being, in oppo&s;ition
<PB N="16" REF="037564_0014_100EDC9875BABED8">to a plurality of Gods, it is not nece&s;&s;ary to have re|cour&s;e to metaphy&s;ical ab&s;tractions: it is &s;ufficient to ob|&s;erve, that the notion of more than one author of nature is incon&s;i&s;tent with that harmony of de&s;ign which per|vades her works, that it &s;olves no appearances, is &s;up|ported by no evidence, and &s;erves no purpo&s;e but to em|barra&s;s and perplex our conceptions.</P>
<P>Such are the proofs of the exi&s;tence of that great and glorious Being whom we denominate God; and it is not pre&s;umption to &s;ay, it is impo&s;&s;ible to find another truth in the whole compa&s;s of morals, which, according to the ju&s;te&s;t laws of rea&s;oning, admits of &s;uch &s;trict and rigorous demon&s;tration.</P>
<P>But I proceed to the more immediate object of this di&s;cour&s;e, which, as has been already intimated, is not &s;o much to evince the fal&s;ehood of Sceptici&s;m as a theo|ry, as to di&s;play its mi&s;chievous effects, contra&s;ted with tho&s;e which re&s;ult from the belief of a Deity, and a fu|ture &s;tate. The &s;ubject viewed in this light, may be con&s;idered under two a&s;pects; the influence of the op|po&s;ite &s;y&s;tems on the principles of morals, and on the formation of character; the fir&s;t may be &s;tiled their di|rect, the latter their equally important, but indirect, con&s;equence and tendency.</P>
<P N="1">I. The &s;ceptical or irreligious &s;y&s;tem &s;ubverts the whole foundation of morals. It may be a&s;&s;umed as a maxim, that no per&s;on can be required to act contrary to his greate&s;t good, or his highe&s;t intere&s;t, comprehen|&s;ively viewed in relation to the whole duration of his being. It is often our duty to forego our own intere&s;t <HI>partially;</HI> to &s;acrifice a &s;maller plea&s;ure for the &s;ake of a greater; to incur a pre&s;ent evil in pur&s;uit of a di&s;tant good of more con&s;equence: in a word, to arbitrate, among&s;t interfering claims of inclination, is the moral arithmetic of human life. But to ri&s;que the happine&s;s of the whole duration of our being in any ca&s;e whatever, admitting it to be po&s;&s;ible, would be fooli&s;h, becau&s;e the
<PB N="17" REF="037564_0015_100EDC9ACB925F30">&s;acrifice mu&s;t, by the nature of it, be &s;o great as to pre|clude the po&s;&s;ibility of compen&s;ation.</P>
<P>As the pre&s;ent world, upon &s;ceptical principles, is the only place of recompence, whenever the practice of virtue fails to promi&s;e the greate&s;t &s;um of pre&s;ent good, ca&s;es which often occur in reality, and much oft|ener in appearance, every motive to virtuous conduct is &s;uper&s;eded, a deviation from rectitude becomes the part of wi&s;dom; and &s;hould the path of virtue, in addition to this, be ob&s;tructed by di&s;grace, torment, or death, to per&s;evere would be madne&s;s and folly, and a violation of the fir&s;t and mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential law of nature. Virtue on the&s;e principles, being in numberle&s;s in&s;tances, at war with &s;elf-pre&s;ervation, never can or ought to become a fixed habit of the mind.</P>
<P>The &s;y&s;tem of Infidelity is not only incapable of arming virtue for great and trying occa&s;ions; but leaves it un&s;upported in the mo&s;t ordinary occurrences. In vain will its advocates appeal to a moral &s;en&s;e, to bene|volence and &s;ympathy; in vain will they expatiate on the tranquillity and plea&s;ure attendant on a virtuous cour&s;e; for it is undeniable that the&s;e impul&s;es may be overcome, and though you may remind the offender, that in di&s;regarding them he has violated his nature, and that a conduct con&s;i&s;tent with them is productive of much internal &s;atisfaction; yet, if he reply that his ta&s;te is of a different &s;ort, that there are other gratifications which he values more, and that every man mu&s;t choo&s;e his own plea&s;ures, the argument is at an end.</P>
<P>Rewards and puni&s;hments awarded by omnipotent power, afford a palpable and pre&s;&s;ing motive, which can never be neglected without renouncing the character of a rational creature; but ta&s;tes and reli&s;hes are not to be pre&s;cribed.</P>
<P>A motive in which the rea&s;on of man &s;hall acquie&s;ce, enforcing the practice of virtue, at all times and &s;ea&s;ons, enters into the very e&s;&s;ence of moral obligation; mo|dern infidelity &s;upplies no &s;uch motive; it is, therefore,

<P>This cha&s;m in the con&s;truction of morals, can only be &s;upplied by the firm belief of a rewarding and avenging Deity, who binds duty and happine&s;s, though they may &s;eem di&s;tant, in an indi&s;&s;oluble chain, without which whatever u&s;urps the name of virtue, is not a principle, but a feeling, not a determinate rule, but a fluctuating expedient, varying with the ta&s;tes of indi|viduals, and changing with the &s;cenes of life.</P>
<P>Nor is this the only way in which Infidelity &s;ubverts the foundation of morals. All rea&s;oning on the mo|rals, pre-&s;uppo&s;es a di&s;tinction betwixt inclinations and duties, affections and rules: the former prompt, the lat|ter pre&s;cribe; the former &s;upply motives to action, the latter regulate and control it. Hence, it is evident, if virtue has any ju&s;t claim to authority, it mu&s;t be under the latter of the&s;e notions, that is, under the character of a law. It is under this notion, <HI>in fact,</HI> that its domi|nion has ever been acknowledged to be paramount and &s;upreme.</P>
<P>But without the intervention of a &s;uperior will, it is impo&s;&s;ible there &s;hould be any moral laws, except in the lax, metaphorical &s;en&s;e, in which we &s;peak of the laws of matter and motion: men being e&s;&s;entially equal, morality is, on the&s;e principles, only a &s;tipula|tion or &s;ilent compact, into which every individual is &s;uppo&s;ed to enter, as far as &s;uits his convenience, and for the breach of which he is accountable to nothing but his own mind. His own mind is his law, his tri|bunal, and his judge.</P>
<P>Two con&s;equences, the mo&s;t di&s;a&s;trous to &s;ociety, will inevitably follow the general prevalence of this &s;y&s;tem; the frequent perpetration of great crimes, and the total ab&s;ence of great virtues.</P>
<P N="1">1. In tho&s;e conjunctures which tempt avarice or in|flame ambition, when a crime flatters with the pro&s;|pect of impunity and the certainty of immen&s;e advan|tage,
<PB N="19" REF="037564_0017_100EDC9E3585B0D0">what is to re&s;train an Athei&s;t from its commi&s;|&s;ion? To &s;ay that remor&s;e will deter him, is ab&s;urd; for remor&s;e, as di&s;tingui&s;hed from pity, is the &s;ole off|&s;pring of religious belief, the extinction of which is the great purpo&s;e of the infidel philo&s;ophy.</P>
<P>The dread of puni&s;hment or infamy from his fellow creatures, will be an equally ineffectual barrier, becau&s;e crimes are only committed under &s;uch circum&s;tances as &s;ugge&s;t the hope of concealment; not to &s;ay that crimes them&s;elves will &s;oon lo&s;e their infamy and their hor|ror, under the influence of that &s;y&s;tem which de&s;troys the &s;anctity of virtue, by converting it into a low calcu|lation of worldly intere&s;t. Here the &s;en&s;e of an ever-pre&s;ent Ruler and of an avenging Judge, is of the mo&s;t awful and indi&s;pen&s;ible nece&s;&s;ity, as it is that alone which impre&s;&s;es on all crimes the character of folly, &s;hews that duty and intere&s;t in every in&s;tance coincide, and that the mo&s;t pro&s;perous career of vice, the mo&s;t brilliant &s;ucce&s;&s;es of criminality, are but an <HI>accumula|tion of wrath against the day of wrath.</HI></P>
<P>As the frequent perpetration of great crimes is an inevitable con&s;equence of the diffu&s;ion of &s;ceptical principles, &s;o to under&s;tand this con&s;equence in its full extent, we mu&s;t look beyond their immediate effects, and confider the di&s;ruption of &s;ocial ties, the de&s;truc|tion of confidence, the terror, &s;u&s;picion and hatred, which mu&s;t prevail in that &s;tate of &s;ociety in which barbarous deeds are familiar. The tranquillity which pervades a well-ordered community, and the mutual good offices which bind its members together, is founded on an implied confidence in the indi&s;po&s;ition to annoy, in the ju&s;tice, humanity and moderation of tho&s;e among whom we dwell; &s;o that the wor&s;t con&s;equence of crimes is, that they impair the &s;tock of public charity and general tenderne&s;s. The dread and hatred of our &s;pecies would infallibly be grafted on a conviction that we were expo&s;|ed, every moment, to the &s;urges of an unbridled fe|rocity, and that nothing but the power of the magi&s;|trate

This is but a faint &s;ketch of the incalculable calamities and horrors we mu&s;t expect, &s;hould we be &s;o unfortunate as ever to witne&s;s the triumph of mo|dern infidelity.</P>
<P N="2">2. This &s;y&s;tem is a &s;oil as barren of great and &s;ub|lime virtues, as it is prolific in crimes. By great and &s;ublime virtues are meant, tho&s;e which are called into action on great and trying occa&s;ions, which demand the &s;acrifice of the deare&s;t intere&s;ts and pro&s;pects of human life, and &s;ometimes of life it&s;elf; the virtues, in a word, which by their rarity and &s;plendour draw admiration, and have rendered illu&s;trious the charac|ter of patriots, martyrs, and confe&s;&s;ors. It requires but little reflection to perceive, that whatever veils a future world, and contracts the limits of exi&s;tence within the pre&s;ent life, mu&s;t tend, in a proportionable degree, to dimini&s;h the grandeur and narrow the &s;phere of human agency.</P>
<P>As well might you expect exalted &s;entiments of ju&s;|tice from a profe&s;&s;ed game&s;ter, as look for noble princi|ciples in the man who&s;e hopes and fears are all &s;u&s;|pended on the pre&s;ent moment, and who &s;takes the whole happine&s;s of his being on the events of this vain and fleeting life. If he is ever impelled to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> of great atchievements in a good cau&s;e, it mu&s;t be &s;olely by the hope of fame; a motive which, be&s;ides that it makes virtue the &s;ervant of opinion, u&s;ually grows weaker at the approach of death, and
<PB N="21" REF="037564_0019_100EDCA27AE4D7E0">which, however it may &s;urmount the love of exi&s;tence, in the heat of battle, or in the moment of public ob|&s;ervation, can &s;eldom be expected to operate with much force on the retired duties of a private &s;tation.</P>
<P>In affirming that infidelity is unfavourable to the higher cla&s;s of virtues, we are &s;upported as well by facts as by rea&s;oning. We &s;hould be &s;orry to load our adver&s;aries with unmerited reproach; but to what hi&s;|tory, to what record, will they appeal, for the traits of moral greatne&s;s, exhibited by their di&s;ciples? Where &s;hall we look for the trophies of infidel magnanimity, or athei&s;tical virtue? Not that we mean to accu&s;e them of inactivity: they have recently filled the world with the &s;ame of their exploits; exploits of a different kind indeed, but of imperi&s;hable memory and di&s;a&s;trous lu&s;tre.</P>
<P>Though it is confe&s;&s;ed, great and &s;plendid actions are not the ordinary employment of life, but mu&s;t from their nature, be re&s;erved for high and eminent occa|&s;ions, yet, that &s;y&s;tem is e&s;&s;entially defective which leaves no room for their cultivation. They are im|portant, both from their immediate advantage and their remoter influence. They often &s;ave, and always illu&s;trate, the age and nation in which they appear. They rai&s;e the &s;tandard of morals; they arre&s;t the pro|gre&s;s of degeneracy; they diffu&s;e a lu&s;tre over the path of life: monuments of the greatne&s;s of the human &s;oul, they pre&s;ent to the world the augu&s;t image of virtue in her &s;ublime&s;t form, from which &s;treams of light and glory i&s;&s;ue to remote times and ages; while their commemoration, by the pen of hi&s;torians and poets, awakens in di&s;tant bo&s;oms the &s;parks of kin|dred excellence.</P>
<P>Combine the frequent and familiar perpetration of atrocious deeds, with the dearth of great and gene|rous actions, and you have the exact picture of that condition of &s;ociety, which completes the degradation of the &s;pecies; the frightful contra&s;t of dwarfi&s;h vir|tues
<PB N="22" REF="037564_0020_100ED2869E53E2B0">and gigantic vices, where every thing good is mean and little, and every thing evil is rank and luxu|riant; a dead and &s;ickening uniformity prevails, bro|ken only at intervals by volcanic eruptions of anarchy and crime.</P>
<P N="2">II. Hitherto we have con&s;idered the influence of Sceptici&s;m on the principles of virtue; and have en|deavoured to &s;hew that it de&s;poils it of its dignity, and lays its authority in the du&s;t: its influence on the formation of character remains to be examined. The actions of men are oftener determined by their charac|ter than their intere&s;t: their conduct takes its colour more from their acquired ta&s;te, inclinations and ha|bits, than from a deliberate regard to their greate&s;t good. It is only on great occa&s;ions the mind awakes, to take an extended &s;urvey of her whole cour&s;e, and that &s;he &s;uffers the dictates of rea&s;on to impre&s;s a new bias upon her movements; the actions of each day are, for the mo&s;t part, links which follow each other in the chain of cu&s;tom. Hence the great effort of practical wi&s;dom is to imbue the mind with right ta&s;tes, affec|tions and habits; the elements of character, and ma&s;|ters of action.</P>
<P>The exclu&s;ion of a Supreme Being and of a &s;uper|intending Providence, tends directly to the de&s;truc|tion of moral ta&s;te. It robs the univer&s;e of all fini&s;hed and con&s;ummate excellence, even in idea. The ad|miration of perfect wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s, for which we are formed, and which kindles &s;uch un&s;peakable rapture in the &s;oul, finding in the regions of &s;ceptici&s;m nothing to which it corre&s;ponds, droops and langui&s;hes. In a world which pre&s;ents a fair &s;pectacle of order and beauty, of a va&s;t family nouri&s;hed and &s;upported by an Almighty parent, in a world which leads the devout mind, &s;tep by &s;tep, to the contemplation of the fir&s;t fair and the fir&s;t good, the &s;ceptic is encompa&s;&s;ed with nothing but ob&s;curity, meanne&s;s, and di&s;order.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="037564_0021_100EDCA44786E910">
When we reflect on the manner in which the idea of Deity is formed, we mu&s;t be convinced that &s;uch an idea, intimately pre&s;ent to the mind, mu&s;t have a mo&s;t powerful effect in refining the moral ta&s;te. Compo&s;ed of the riche&s;t elements, it embraces, in the character of a beneficent parent, and Almighty ruler, whatever is venerable in wi&s;dom, whatever is awful in authority, whatever is touching in goodne&s;s.</P>
<P>Human excellence is blended with many imperfec|tions, and &s;een under many limitations; it is beheld only in detached and &s;eparate portions, nor ever ap|pears in any one character whole and entire: &s;o that, when, in imitation of the &s;toics, we wi&s;h to form out of the&s;e fragments the notion of a perfectly wi&s;e and good man, we know it is a mere fiction of the mind, without any real being in whom it is embodied and realized. In the belief of a Deity the&s;e conceptions are reduced to reality: the &s;cattered rays of an ideal excellence are concentrated, and become the real at|tributes of that Being with whom we &s;tand in the near|e&s;t relation, who &s;its Supreme at the head of the uni|ver&s;e, is armed with infinite power, and pervades all nature with his pre&s;ence.</P>
<P>The efficacy of the&s;e &s;entiments, in producing and augmenting a virtuous ta&s;te, will indeed be proportion|ed to the vividne&s;s with which they are formed, and the frequency with which they recur; yet &s;ome benefit will not fail to re&s;ult from them even in their lowe&s;t degree.</P>
<P>The idea of the &s;upreme Being, has this peculiar pro|perty, that as it admits of no &s;ub&s;titute, &s;o from the fir&s;t moment it is impre&s;&s;ed, it is capable of continual growth and enlargement. God him&s;elf is immutable; but our conception of his character is continually re|ceiving fre&s;h acce&s;&s;ions, is continually growing more extended and refulgent, by having transferred upon it new perceptions of beauty and goodne&s;s, by attracting to it&s;elf, as a centre, whatever bears the impre&s;s of dig|nity, order or happine&s;s. It borrows &s;plendour from
<PB N="24" REF="037564_0022_100EDCA608F22940">all that is fair, &s;ubordinates to it&s;elf all that is great, and &s;its enthroned on the riches of the univer&s;e.</P>
<P>As the object of wor&s;hip will always be, in a degree, the object of imitation, hence ari&s;es a fixed &s;tandard of moral excellence, by the contemplation of which the tendencies to corruption are counteracted, the conta|gion of bad example is checked, and human nature ri&s;es above its natural level.</P>
<P>When the knowledge of God was lo&s;t in the world, ju&s;t ideas of virtue and moral obligation di&s;appeared along with it. How is it to be otherwi&s;e accounted for, that in the poli&s;hed nations, and in the enlightened times of Pagan antiquity, the mo&s;t unnatural lu&s;ts and dete&s;table impurities were not only tolerated in private life,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is worthy of ob&s;ervation, that the elegant and philo&s;o|phic <HI>Xenophon,</HI> in delineating the model of a perfect Prince in the character of Cyrus, introduces a Mede who had formed an unnatural pa&s;&s;ion for his hero, and relates the incident in a live|ly fe&s;tive humour, without being in the lea&s;t con&s;cious of any indelicacy attached to it. What mu&s;t be the &s;tate of manners in a country where a circum&s;tance of this kind, feigned, no doubt, by way of ornament, finds a place in &s;uch a work?

The rea&s;on is this&mdash;the true character of God was unknown to the former, which, by the light of divine revelation, was imparted to the latter. The former ca&s;t their deities in the mould of their own immagina|tions, in con&s;equence of which they partook of the vices and defects of their wor&s;hippers: to the latter, no &s;cope was left for the wanderings of fancy, but a pure and perfect model was pre&s;cribed.</P>
<P>Fal&s;e and corrupt, however, as was the religion of the Pagans (if it de&s;erve the name) and defective, and often vicious, as was the character of their imaginary deities, it was &s;till better for the world, for the void of knowledge to be filled with the&s;e, than abandoned to a total Sceptici&s;m; for if both &s;y&s;tems are equally fal&s;e, they are not equally pernicious. When the fictions of heatheni&s;m con&s;ecrated the memory of its legi&s;lators and heroes, it inve&s;ted them for the mo&s;t part with tho&s;e qualities which were in the greate&s;t repute. They were &s;uppo&s;ed to po&s;&s;e&s;s in the highe&s;t degree the vir|tues in which it was mo&s;t honourable to excel, and to be the witne&s;&s;es, approvers and patrons of tho&s;e perfec|tions in others, by which their own character was chief|ly di&s;tingui&s;hed. Men &s;aw, or rather fancied they &s;aw, in the&s;e &s;uppo&s;ed deities, the qualities they mo&s;t ad|mired dilated to a larger &s;ize, moving in a higher &s;phere, and a&s;&s;ociated with the power, dignity and happine&s;s of &s;uperior natures. With &s;uch ideal models before them, and conceiving them&s;elves continually acting under the eye of &s;uch &s;pectators and judges, they felt a real eleva|tion; their eloquence became more impa&s;&s;ioned, their patrioti&s;m inflamed and their courage exalted.</P>
<P>Revelation, by di&s;playing the true character of God, affords a pure and perfect &s;tandard of virtue; heathen|i&s;m, one in many re&s;pects defective and vicious; the fa&s;hionable &s;ceptici&s;m of the pre&s;ent day, which ex|cludes the belief of all &s;uperior powers, affords no &s;tand|ard at all. Human nature knows nothing better or higher than it&s;elf. All above and around it being
<PB N="26" REF="037564_0024_100EDCA9B4E38D00">&s;hrouded in darkne&s;s, and the pro&s;pect confined to the tame realities of life, virtue has no room upwards to expand, nor are any excur&s;ions permitted into that un|&s;een world, the true element of the great and good, by which it is fortified with motives equally calculated to &s;atisfy the rea&s;on, to delight the fancy, and to impre&s;s the heart.</P>
<P N="2">II. Modern Infidelity not only tends to corrupt the moral ta&s;te; it al&s;o promotes the growth of tho&s;e vices which are the mo&s;t ho&s;tile to &s;ocial happine&s;s. Of all the vices incident to human nature, the mo&s;t de&s;truc|tive to &s;ociety are vanity, ferocity, and unbridled &s;en&s;u|ality; and the&s;e are preci&s;ely the vices which Infidelity is calculated to cheri&s;h.</P>
<P>That the love, fear, and habitual contemplation of a being infinitely exalted, or in other words, devotion is adapted to promote a &s;ober and moderate e&s;timate of our own excellencies, is inconte&s;tible; nor is it le&s;s evident that the exclu&s;ion of &s;uch &s;entiments mu&s;t be favorable to pride. The criminality of pride will, perhaps, be le&s;s readily admitted; for though there is no vice &s;o oppo&s;ite to the &s;pirit of Chri&s;tianity, yet there is none which, even in the Chri&s;tian world, has, under various pretences, been treated with &s;o much indulgence.</P>
<P>There is, it will be confe&s;&s;ed, a delicate &s;en&s;ibility to character, a &s;ober de&s;ire of reputation, a wi&s;h to po&s;&s;e&s;s the e&s;teem of the wi&s;e and good, felt by the pure&s;t minds, and which is at the farthe&s;t remove from arro|gance or vanity. The humility of a noble mind &s;carce|ly dares to approve of it&s;elf, until it has &s;ecured the ap|probation of others. Very different is that re&s;tle&s;s de|&s;ire of di&s;tinction, that pa&s;&s;ion for theatrical di&s;play, which inflames the heart and occupies the whole atten|tion of vain men. This, of all the pa&s;&s;ions, is the mo&s;t un&s;ocial, avarice it&s;elf not excepted. The rea&s;on is plain. Property is a kind of good, which may be more ea&s;ily attained, and is capable of more minute &s;ubdivi|&s;ions, than fame. In the pur&s;uit of wealth, men are led
<PB N="27" REF="037564_0025_100EDCAB679CFDC0">by an attention to their own intere&s;t to promote the welfare of each other; their advantages are reciprocal; the benefits which each is anxious to acquire for him|&s;elf, he reaps in the greate&s;t abundance from the union and conjunction of &s;ociety. The pur&s;uits of vanity are quite contrary. The portion of time and attention mankind are willing to &s;pare from their avocations and plea&s;ures, to devote to the admiration of each other is &s;o &s;mall, that every &s;ucce&s;sful adventurer is felt to have impaired the common &s;tock. The &s;ucce&s;s of one is the di&s;appointment of multitudes. For though there be many rich, many virtuous, many wi&s;e men, fame mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be the portion of but few. Hence every vain man, every man in whom vanity is the ruling pa&s;|&s;ion, regarding his rival as his enemy, is &s;trongly tempt|ed to rejoice in his mi&s;carriage and repine at his &s;uc|ce&s;s.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, as the pa&s;&s;ions are &s;eldom &s;een in a &s;imple, unmixed &s;tate, &s;o vanity, when it &s;ucceeds, degenerates into arrogance; when it is di&s;appointed (and it is oft|en di&s;appointed) it is exa&s;perated into malignity and corrupted into envy. In this &s;tage the vain man com|mences a determined mi&s;anthrophi&s;t. He dete&s;ts that excellence which he cannot reach. He dete&s;ts his &s;pe|cies, and longs to be revenged for the unpardonable in|ju&s;tice he has &s;u&s;tained in their in&s;en&s;ibility to his me|rits. He lives upon the calamities of the world: the vices and mi&s;eries of men are his element and his food.</P>
<P>Virtue, talents and genius are his natural enemies, which he per&s;ecutes with in&s;tinctive eagerne&s;s, and un|relenting ho&s;tility. There are who doubt the exi&s;tence of &s;uch a di&s;po&s;ition; but it certainly i&s;&s;ues out of the dregs of di&s;appointed vanity: a di&s;ea&s;e which taints and vitiates the whole character wherever it prevails. It forms the heart to &s;uch a profound indifference to the welfare of others, that whatever appearances he may a&s;|&s;ume, or however wide the circle of his &s;eeming vir|tues may extend, you will infallibly find the vain man
<PB N="28" REF="037564_0026_100EDCAD352817E0">is his own centre. Attentive only to him&s;elf, ab&s;orbed in the contemplation of his own perfections, in&s;tead of feeling tenderne&s;s for his fellow creatures as members of the &s;ame family, as beings with whom he is appoint|ed to act, to &s;uffer, and to &s;ympathize; he con&s;iders life as a &s;tage on which he is performing a part, and man|kind in no other light than &s;pectators. Whether he &s;miles or frowns, whether his path is adorned with the rays of benificence or his &s;teps are died in blood, an at|tention to &s;elf is the &s;pring of every movement, and the motive to which every action is referred.</P>
<P>His apparent good qualities lo&s;e all their worth, by lo&s;ing all that is &s;imple, genuine and natural: they are even pre&s;&s;ed into the &s;ervice of vanity, and become the means of enlarging its power. The truly good man is jealous over him&s;elf, le&s;t the notoriety of his be&s;t actions by blending it&s;elf with their motive, &s;hould dimini&s;h their value; the vain man performs the &s;ame actions for the &s;ake of that notoriety. The good man quietly di&s;charges his duty and &s;huns o&s;tentation; the vain man con&s;iders every good deed lo&s;t that is not publicly di&s;|played. The one is intent upon realities, the other up|on &s;emblances: the one aims to <HI>be</HI> virtuous, the other to <HI>appear</HI> &s;o.</P>
<P>Nor is a mind inflated with vanity more di&s;qualified for right action than ju&s;t &s;peculation; or better di&s;po&s;ed to the pur&s;uit of truth than the practice of virtue. To &s;uch a mind the &s;implicity of truth is di&s;gu&s;ting. Care|le&s;s of the improvement of mankind, and intent only upon a&s;toni&s;hing with the appearance of novelty, the glare of paradox will be preferred to the light of truth; opinions will be embraced, not becau&s;e they are ju&s;t, but becau&s;e they are new: the more flagitious, the more &s;ubver&s;ive of morals, the more alarming to the wi&s;e and good, the more welcome to men who e&s;timate their literary powers by the mi&s;chief they produce, and who con&s;ider the anxiety and terror they impre&s;s as the mea|&s;ure of their renown. Truth is &s;imple and uniform,

Con|ceive of a dome&s;tic circle, in which each member is elated with a mo&s;t extravagant opinion of him&s;elf, and a proportionable contempt of every other, is full of little contrivances to catch applau&s;e, and whenever he is not prai&s;ed is &s;ullen and di&s;appointed&mdash;what a picture of di&s;union, di&s;gu&s;t, and animo&s;ity would &s;uch a family pre&s;ent; how utterly would dome&s;tic affection be extin|gui&s;hed, and all the purpo&s;es of dome&s;tic &s;ociety be de|feated!

<P>Suppo&s;e there were a great and glorious Being al|ways pre&s;ent with us, who had given us exi&s;tence with numberle&s;s other ble&s;&s;ings, and on whom we depended each in&s;tant, as well for every pre&s;ent enjoyment as for every future good; &s;uppo&s;e again, we had incurred the ju&s;t di&s;plea&s;ure of &s;uch a Being, by ingratitude and di&s;obedience, yet that in great mercy he had not ca&s;t us off, but had a&s;&s;ured us he was willing to pardon and re|&s;tore us, on our humble intreaty and &s;incere repen|tance; &s;ay, would not an habitual &s;en&s;e of the pre&s;ence of this Being, &s;elf-reproach for having di&s;plea&s;ed him, and an anxiety to recover his favour, be the mo&s;t effec|tual antidote to pride?

<P>Humility is the fir&s;t fruit of religion. In the mouth of our Lord there is no maxim &s;o frequent as the fol|lowing, <HI>Whosoever exalteth himself shall be abased, and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.</HI> Religion, and that alone, teaches <HI>absolute</HI> humility, by which I mean a &s;en&s;e of our <HI>absolute</HI> nothingne&s;s in the view of
<PB N="32" REF="037564_0030_100EDCB5227BB688">infinite greatne&s;s and excellence. That &s;en&s;e of inferi|ority, which re&s;ults from the compari&s;on of men with each other, is often an unwelcome &s;entiment forced up|on the mind, which may rather embitter the temper than &s;often it: that which devotion impre&s;&s;es, is &s;ooth|ing and delightful. The devout man loves to lie low at the foot&s;tool of his Creator, becau&s;e it is then he at|tains the mo&s;t lively perceptions of the divine excel|lence, and the mo&s;t tranquil confidence in the divine fa|vour. In &s;o augu&s;t a pre&s;ence, he &s;ees all di&s;tinctions lo&s;t, and all beings reduced to the &s;ame level: he looks at his &s;uperiors without envy, and his inferiors without contempt; and when from this elevation he de&s;cends to mix in &s;ociety, the conviction of &s;uperiority, which mu&s;t in many in&s;tances be felt, is a calm inference of the under&s;tanding, and no longer a bu&s;y, importunate pa&s;&s;ion of the heart.</P>

<P>We mentioned a ferocity of character, as one effect of &s;ceptical impiety. It is an inconvenience attending a controver&s;y with tho&s;e with whom we have few prin|ciples in common, that we are often in danger of rea&s;on|ing inconclu&s;ively, for the want of its being clearly known and &s;ettled what our opponents admit, and what they deny. The per&s;ons, for example, with whom we are at pre&s;ent engaged, have di&s;carded humility and
<PB N="33" REF="037564_0031_100EDCB6B25C45E0">mode&s;ty from the catalogue of virtues; on which ac|count we have employed the more time in evincing their importance; but whatever may be thought of hu|mility as a <HI>virtue,</HI> it &s;urely will not be denied that inhu|manity is a mo&s;t dete&s;table <HI>vice;</HI> a vice, however, which &s;ceptici&s;m has a mo&s;t powerful tendency to inflame.</P>
<P>As we have already &s;hewn that pride hardens the heart, and that Religion is the only effectual antidote, the connection between irreligion and inhumanity is, in this view, obvious. But there is another light in which this part of the &s;ubject may be viewed, in my humble opinion, much more important, though &s;eldom adverted to. The &s;uppo&s;ition that man is a moral and accounta|ble being, de&s;tined to &s;urvive the &s;troke of death, and to live in a future world in a never ending &s;tate of happine&s;s or mi&s;ery, makes him a creature of in|comparably more <HI>consequence,</HI> than the oppo&s;ite &s;up|po&s;ition. When we con&s;ider him as placed here by an Almighty Ruler, in a &s;tate of probation, and that the pre&s;ent life is his period of trial, the fir&s;t link in a va&s;t and interminable chain which &s;tretches into eternity, he a&s;&s;umes a dignified character in our eyes. Every thing which relates to him becomes inter|e&s;ting; and to trifle with his happine&s;s is felt to be the mo&s;t unpardonable levity. If &s;uch be the de&s;tination of man, it is evident, that, in the qualities which fit him for it, his principal dignity con&s;i&s;ts: his moral great|ne&s;s is his true greatne&s;s. Let the &s;ceptical principles be admitted, which repre&s;ent him, on the contrary, as the offspring of chance, connected with no &s;uperior pow|er, and &s;inking into annihilation at death, and he is a contemptible creature, who&s;e exi&s;tence and happine&s;s are in&s;ignificant. The characteri&s;tic difference is lo&s;t betwixt him and the brute creation, from which he is no longer di&s;tingui&s;hed, except by the vividne&s;s and muli|plicity of his perceptions.</P>
<P>If we reflect on that part of our nature which di&s;po&s;|es us to humanity, we &s;hall find that, where we have no particular attachment, our &s;ympathy with the &s;uffer|ings,
<PB N="34" REF="037564_0032_100EDCB8ED7EE578">and concern for the de&s;truction of &s;en&s;itive beings, is in proportion to their &s;uppo&s;ed importance in the ge|neral &s;cale; or, in other words, to their &s;uppo&s;ed capa|city of enjoyment. We feel, for example, much more at witne&s;&s;ing the de&s;truction of a man than of an inferior animal, becau&s;e we con&s;ider it as involving the ex|tinction of a much greater &s;um of happine&s;s. For the &s;ame rea&s;on, he who would &s;hudder at the &s;laughter of a large animal, will &s;ee a thou&s;and in&s;ects peri&s;h without a pang. Our &s;ympathy with the calamities of our fel|low-creatures is adju&s;ted to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> proportions: for we feel more powerfully affected with the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of fallen greatne&s;s, than with equal or greater di&s;tre&s;&s;es &s;u&s;tained by per&s;ons of inferior rank; becau&s;e, having been accu&s;tomed to a&s;&s;ociate with an elevated &s;tation the idea of &s;uperior happine&s;s, the lo&s;s appears the great|er, and the wreck more exten&s;ive. But the di&s;propor|tion in importance, betwixt man and the meane&s;t in&s;ect, is not &s;o great, as that which &s;ub&s;i&s;ts betwixt man con|&s;idered as <HI>mortal</HI> and as <HI>immortal;</HI> that is, betwixt man as he is repre&s;ented by the &s;y&s;tem of Sceptici&s;m and that of Divine Revelation: for the enjoyment of the meane&s;t in&s;ect bears &s;ome proportion, though a very &s;mall one, to the pre&s;ent happine&s;s of man; but the hap|pine&s;s of time bears none at all to that of eternity. The Sceptical &s;y&s;tem, therefore, &s;inks the importance of hu|man exi&s;tence to an inconceivable degree.</P>
<P>From the&s;e principles re&s;ults the following important inference, that, to extingui&s;h human life by the hand of violence, mu&s;t be quite a different thing in the eyes of a Sceptic from what it is in tho&s;e of a Chri&s;tian. With the Sceptic it is nothing more than diverting the cour&s;e of a little red fluid called blood; it is merely le&s;&s;ening the number by one of many millions of fugitive contemptible creatures: the Chri&s;tian &s;ees, in the &s;ame event, an accountable being cut off from a &s;tate of pro|bation, and hurried, perhaps unprepared, into the pre|&s;ence of his Judge, to hear that final, that irrevocable
<PB N="35" REF="037564_0033_100EDCBAAB01EB10">&s;entence, which is to fix him for ever in an unalterable condition of felicity or woe. The former perceives in death nothing but its phy&s;ical circum&s;tances; the latter is impre&s;&s;ed with the magnitude of its moral con&s;e|quences. It is the moral relation which man is &s;up|po&s;ed to bear to a &s;uperior power, the awful idea of ac|countability, the influence which his pre&s;ent di&s;po&s;itions and actions are conceived to have upon his eternal de&s;|tiny, more than any &s;uperiority of intellectual powers, ab&s;tracted from the&s;e con&s;iderations, which inve&s;t him with &s;uch my&s;terious grandeur, and con&s;titute the firm|e&s;t guard on the &s;anctuary of human life. This rea|&s;oning, it is true, &s;erves more <HI>immediately</HI> to &s;hew how the di&s;belief of a future &s;tate endangers the &s;ecurity of life; but though this be its <HI>direct</HI> con&s;equence, it ex|tends by analogy much farther: &s;ince he, who has learn|ed to &s;port with the <HI>lives</HI> of his fellow-creatures, will feel but little &s;olicitude for their welfare in any other in|&s;tance; but, as the greater includes the le&s;s, will ea&s;ily pa&s;s from this to all the inferior gradations of barbarity.</P>
<P>As the advantage of the armed over the unarmed is not &s;een till the moment of attack, &s;o in that tran|quil &s;tate of &s;ociety, in which law and order main|tain their a&s;cendancy, it is not perceived, perhaps not even &s;u&s;pected, to what an alarming degree the princi|ples of modern infidelity leave us naked and defence|le&s;s. But, let the &s;tate be convul&s;ed, let the mounds of regular authority be once overflowed, and the &s;till &s;mall voice of law, drowned in the tempe&s;t of popular fury (events which recent experience &s;hews to be po&s;&s;i|ble) it will then be &s;een that athei&s;m is a &s;chool of ferocity; and that having taught its di&s;ciples to con&s;i|der mankind as little better than a ne&s;t of in&s;ects, they will be prepared, in the fierce conflicts of party, to trample upon them without pity, and extingui&s;h them without remor&s;e.</P>

There is a third vice, not le&s;s de&s;tructive to &s;ociety than either of tho&s;e which have been already mentioned, to which the &s;y&s;tem of modern infidelity is favourable; that is, unbridled &s;en&s;uality, the licentious and unre|&s;trained indulgence of tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions which are e&s;&s;ential to the continuation of the &s;pecies. The magnitude of the&s;e pa&s;&s;ions, and the &s;upreme importance to the ex|i&s;tence as well as the peace and welfare of &s;ociety, have rendered it one of the fir&s;t objects of &s;olicitude with every wi&s;e legi&s;lature, to re&s;train them by &s;uch laws, and to confine their indulgence within &s;uch li|mits, as &s;hall be&s;t promote the great ends for which they were implanted.</P>
<P>The benevolence and wi&s;dom of the author of Chri&s;tianity are eminently con&s;picuous in the laws he has enacted on this branch of morals; for, while he authori&s;es marriage, he re&s;trains the vagrancy and ca|price of the pa&s;&s;ions, by forbidding polygamy and di|vorce; and, well knowing that offences again&s;t the laws of cha&s;tity u&s;ually &s;pring from an ill-regulated imagina|tion, he inculcates purity of heart.

<P>So much has been &s;aid by many able writers to evince the inconceivable benefits of the marriage in&s;titution, that to hear it &s;eriou&s;ly attacked by men who &s;tile them&s;elves philo&s;ophers, at the clo&s;e of the eighteenth century, mu&s;t awaken indignation and &s;urpri&s;e. The object of this di&s;cour&s;e leads us to direct our attention particularly to the influence of this in&s;titution on the <HI>civilization</HI> of the world.</P>
<P>From the records of Revelation we learn, that mar|riage, or the <HI>permanent union</HI> of the &s;exes, was or|dained by God, and exi&s;ted under different modifica|tions in the early infancy of mankind, without which they could never have emerged from barbari&s;m. For, conceive only what eternal di&s;cord, jealou&s;y, and vio|lence would en&s;ue, were the objects of the tendere&s;t affections &s;ecured to their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or by no law or tie of moral obligation; were dome&s;tic enjoyments di&s;turbed by ince&s;&s;ant fear, and licentiou&s;ne&s;s inflamed by hope. Who could find &s;ufficient tranquillity of mind, to ena|ble him to plan or execute any continued &s;cheme of action, or what room for arts, or &s;ciences, or religion, or virtue, in that &s;tate in which the chief earthly happi|ne&s;s
<PB N="41" REF="037564_0039_100EDCC61D2E3318">was expo&s;ed to every lawle&s;s invader: where one was racked with an ince&s;&s;ant anxiety to keep what the other was equally eager to acquire? It is not probable in it&s;elf, independent of the light of &s;cripture, that the benevolent author of the human race ever placed them in &s;o wretched a condition at fir&s;t: it is certain they could not remain in it long without being exterminated. Marriage, by &s;hutting out the&s;e evils, and enabling every man to re&s;t &s;ecure in his enjoyments, is the great civilizer of the world; with this &s;ecurity the mind is at liberty to expand in generous affections, has lei&s;ure to look abroad, and engage in the pur&s;uits of knowledge, &s;cience, and virtue.</P>
<P>Nor is it in this way only that marriage in&s;titutions are e&s;&s;ential to the welfare of mankind. They are &s;ources of tenderne&s;s, as well as the guardians of peace. With|out the permanent union of the &s;exes, there can be no permanent families: the di&s;&s;olution of nuptial ties in|volves the di&s;&s;olution of dome&s;tic &s;ociety. But do|me&s;tic &s;ociety is the &s;eminary of &s;ocial affections, the cradle of &s;en&s;ibility, where the fir&s;t elements are ac|quired of that tenderne&s;s and humanity, which cement mankind together, and which, were they entirely ex|tingui&s;hed, the whole fabric of &s;ocial in&s;titutions would be di&s;&s;olved.</P>
<P>Families are &s;o many centres of attraction, which pre&s;erve mankind from being &s;cattered and di&s;&s;ipated by the repul&s;ive powers of &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s.

In order to render men benevolent, they mu&s;t fir&s;t be made tender: for benevolent affections are not the offspring of rea&s;oning; they re&s;ult from that culture of the heart, from tho&s;e early impre&s;&s;ions of tenderne&s;s, gratitude, and &s;ympathy, which the endearments of dome&s;tic life are &s;ure to &s;upply, and for the formation of which it is the be&s;t po&s;&s;ible &s;chool.</P>
<P>The advocates of infidelity invert this eternal order of nature. In&s;tead of inculcating the private affec|tions, as a di&s;cipline by which the mind is prepared for tho&s;e of a more public nature, they &s;et them in direct oppo&s;ition to each other; they propo&s;e to build general benevolence on the de&s;truction of individual tender|ne&s;s, and to make us love the whole &s;pecies more, by loving every particular part of it le&s;s. In pur&s;uit of this chimerical project, gratitude, humility, conjugal, parental, and filial affection, together with every other &s;ocial di&s;po&s;ition, are reprobated; virtue is limited to a pa&s;&s;ionate attachment to the general good. Is it not natural to a&s;k, when all the tenderne&s;s of life is extin|gui&s;hed, and all the bands of &s;ociety are untwi&s;ted, from whence this ardent affection for the general good is to &s;pring?</P>
<P>When this &s;avage philo&s;ophy has completed its work, when it has taught its di&s;ciple to look with perfect in|difference on the offspring of his body and the wife of his bo&s;om, to e&s;trange him&s;elf from his friends, in&s;ult his benefactors, and &s;ilence the pleadings of gratitude and pity, will he by thus dive&s;ting him&s;elf of all that is human, be better prepared for the di&s;intere&s;ted love of his &s;pecies?

Extended benevo|lence is the la&s;t and mo&s;t perfect fruit of the private affections; &s;o that to expect to reap the former from the extinction of the latter, is to oppo&s;e the means to the end; is as ab&s;urd as to attempt to reach the &s;ummit of the highe&s;t mountain, without pa&s;&s;ing through the intermediate &s;paces, or to hope to attain the heights of &s;cience by forgetting the fir&s;t elements of knowledge. The&s;e ab&s;urdities have &s;prung, however, in the advo|cates of infidelity, from an ignorance of human na|ture, &s;ufficient to di&s;grace even tho&s;e who did not &s;tile them&s;elves philo&s;ophers. Pre&s;uming, contrary to the experience of every moment, that the affections are awakened by <HI>reasoning,</HI> and perceiving that the general good is an incomparably greater <HI>object in itself,</HI> than the happine&s;s of any limited number of individuals, they inferred that nothing more was nece&s;&s;ary than to exhibit it in its ju&s;t dimen&s;ions, to draw the <HI>affections</HI> towards it; as though the fact of the &s;uperior popu|lou&s;ne&s;s of China to Great Britain, needed but to be known, to render us indifferent to our dome&s;tic con|cerns, and lead us to direct all our anxiety, to the pro&s;|perity of that va&s;t, but remote empire.</P>
<P>It is not the province of rea&s;on to awaken new pa&s;|&s;ions, or open new &s;ources of &s;en&s;ibility, but to direct us in the attainment of tho&s;e objects which nature has already rendered plea&s;ing, or to determine among the interfering inclinations and pa&s;&s;ions which &s;way the mind, which are the fitte&s;t to be preferred.</P>
<P>Is a regard to the general good then, you will reply, to be excluded from the motives of action? Nothing
<PB N="44" REF="037564_0042_100EDCCCC220B168">is more remote from my intention: but as the nature of this motive has, in my opinion, been much mi&s;under|&s;tood by &s;ome good men, and abu&s;ed by others of a different de&s;cription, to the wor&s;t of purpo&s;es, permit me to declare, in a few words, what appears to me to be the truth on this &s;ubject.</P>
<P>The welfare of the whole &s;y&s;tem of being mu&s;t be allowed to be, <HI>in itself,</HI> the object of all others the mo&s;t worthy of being pur&s;ued; &s;o that, could the mind di&s;tinctly embrace it, and di&s;cern at every &s;tep <HI>what action</HI> would infallibly promote it, we &s;hould be furni&s;hed with a &s;ure criterion of right and wrong, an unerring guide, which would &s;uper&s;ede the u&s;e and nece&s;&s;ity of all inferior rules, laws and principles.</P>
<P>But this being impo&s;&s;ible, &s;ince the good of the <HI>whole</HI> is a motive &s;o loo&s;e and indeterminate, and em|braces &s;uch an infinity of relations, that before we could be certain what action it pre&s;cribed, the &s;ea&s;on of action would be pa&s;t; to weak; &s;hort-&s;ighted mor|tals, Providence has a&s;&s;igned a &s;phere of agency, le&s;s grand and exten&s;ive indeed, but better &s;uited to their limited powers, by implanting certain <HI>affections</HI> which it is their duty to cultivate, and &s;ugge&s;ting particular rules to which they are bound to conform. By the&s;e provi&s;ions, the boundaries of virtue are ea&s;ily a&s;cer|tained, at the &s;ame time that its ultimate object, the good of the whole, is &s;ecured; for, &s;ince the happi|ne&s;s of the entire &s;y&s;tem re&s;ults from the happine&s;s of the &s;everal parts, the affections, which confine the at|tention <HI>immediately</HI> to the latter, con&s;pire in the end to the promotion of the former; as the labourer, who&s;e indu&s;try is limited to a corner of a large building, per|forms his part towards rearing the &s;tructure, much more effectually than if he extened his care to the whole.</P>
<P>As the intere&s;t, however, of any limited number of per&s;ons may not only not contribute, but may po&s;&s;ibly be directly oppo&s;ed to the general good; the intere&s;t of
<PB N="45" REF="037564_0043_100EDCCF460A3FD8">a family, for example, to that of a province, or, of a nation to that of the world; Providence has &s;o order|ed it, that in a well-regulated mind there &s;prings up, as we have already &s;een, be&s;ides particular attachments, <HI>an extended regard to the species,</HI> who&s;e office is two|&s;old; not to <HI>destroy</HI> and <HI>extinguish</HI> the more private affections, which is mental parricide; but fir&s;t, as far as is con&s;i&s;tent with the claims of tho&s;e who are immedi|ately committed to our care, <HI>to do good to all men;</HI> &s;econdly, to exerci&s;e a jurisdiction and controul over the private affection, &s;o as to prohibit their indulgence, whenever it would be attended with <HI>manifest detriment</HI> to the whole. Thus every part of our nature is brought into action; all the practical principles of the human heart find an element to move in, each in its different &s;ort and manner, con&s;piring, without mutual colli&s;ions to maintain the harmony of the world and the happine&s;s of the univer&s;e<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is &s;omewhat &s;ingular, that many of the fa&s;hionable Infidels have hit upon a definition of virtue which perfectly co|incides with that of certain metaphy&s;ical divines in America, fir&s;t invented and defended by that mo&s;t acute rea&s;oner <HI>Jona|than Edwards.</HI> They both place virtue, exclu&s;ively, in a pa&s;|&s;ion for the general good, or, as Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI> expre&s;&s;es it, <HI>love to Being in general;</HI> &s;o that our love is always to be pro|portioned to the magnitude of its object in the &s;cale of Being; which is liable to the objections I have already &s;tated, as well as to many others, which the limits of this note will not per|mit me to enumerate. Let it &s;uffice to remark, 1. That vir|tue, on the&s;e principles, is an utter impo&s;&s;ibility: for the &s;y&s;tem of Being, comprehending the great Supreme, is <HI>infinite,</HI> and therefore to maintain the proper proportion, the force of parti|cular attachment mu&s;t be infinitely le&s;s than the pa&s;&s;ion for the general good; but the limits of the human mind are not capa|ble of any emotions &s;o infinitely different <HI>in degree.</HI> 2. Since <HI>our views</HI> of the extent of the univer&s;e are capable of perpetual enlargement, admitting the &s;um of exi&s;tence is ever the &s;ame, we mu&s;t return back at each &s;tep to dimini&s;h the &s;trength of particular affections, or they will become di&s;proportionate, and con&s;equently on the&s;e principles vicious; &s;o that the balance mu&s;t be continually fluctuating, by the weights being taken out of one &s;cale and put into the other. 3. If virtue con&s;i&s;t <HI>exclu|&s;ively</HI> in love to Being in general, or attachment to the general good, the particular affections are, to every purpo&s;e of virtue, u&s;ele&s;s, and even pernicious; for their immediate, nay their nece&s;&s;ary tendency is, to attract to their objects a proportion of attention, which far exceeds their comparative value in the general &s;cale. To allege that the <HI>general good</HI> is promoted by them will be of no advantage to the defence of this &s;y&s;tem, but the contrary, by confe&s;&s;ing that a greater &s;um of happine&s;s is attained by a deviation from, than an adherence to, its prin|ciples; unle&s;s its advocates mean, by the love of Being in ge|neral, the &s;ame thing as the private affections, which is to con|found all the di&s;tinctions of language, as well as all the opera|tions of mind. Let it be remembered, we have no di&s;pute re&s;|pecting what is the ultimate end of virtue, which is allowed on both &s;ides to be the greate&s;t &s;um of happine&s;s in the univer&s;e; the que&s;tion is merely, what is <HI>virtue it&s;elf?</HI> or, in other words, what are the means appointed for the attainment of that end?
<P>There is little doubt, from &s;ome parts of Mr. <HI>Godwin's</HI> work, entitled <HI>"Political Ju&s;tice,"</HI> as well as from his early habits of reading, that he was indebted to Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI> for his principal arguments again&s;t the private affections; though, with a daring con&s;i&s;tence, he has pur&s;ued his principles to an extreme from which that mo&s;t excellent man would have revolt|ed with horror. The fundamental error of the whole &s;y&s;tem aro&s;e, as I conceive, from a mi&s;taken pur&s;uit of &s;implicity; from a wi&s;h to con&s;truct a moral &s;y&s;tem without leaving &s;uffi|cient &s;cope for the infinite variety of moral phoenomena and mental combination: in con&s;equence of which, its advocates were induced to place virtue <HI>exclu&s;ively</HI> in &s;ome <HI>one di&s;po&s;ition</HI> of mind; and, &s;ince the pa&s;&s;ion for the general good is undenia|bly the <HI>noble&s;t</HI> and mo&s;t exten&s;ive of all others, when it was once re&s;olved to place virtue in any <HI>one thing,</HI> there remained lit|tle room to he&s;itate which &s;hould be preferred. It might have been worth while to reflect, that in the natural world there are two kinds of attraction; one which holds the &s;everal <HI>parts</HI> of individual bodies in contact; another, which maintains the union of bodies them&s;elves with the general &s;y&s;tem; and that, though the union in the former ca&s;e is much more <HI>intimate</HI> than in the latter, each is equally e&s;&s;ential to the order of the world. Similar to this is the relation which the public and private affections bear to each other, and their u&s;e in the moral &s;y&s;tem.</P></NOTE>.</P>

The efforts of infidels, to diffu&s;e the principles of infidelity among the common people, is another alarming &s;ympton peculiar to the pre&s;ent time. <HI>Hume, Bolingbroke</HI> and <HI>Gibbon</HI> addre&s;&s;ed them&s;elves &s;olely to the more poli&s;hed cla&s;&s;es of the community, and would have thought their refined &s;peculations deba&s;ed by an attempt to enli&s;t di&s;ciples from among the populace. Infidelity has lately grown conde&s;cending: bred in the &s;peculations of a daring philo&s;ophy, immured at fir&s;t in the cloi&s;ters of the learned, and afterwards nur&s;ed in the lap of voluptuou&s;ne&s;s and of courts; having at length reached its full maturity, it boldly ventures to challenge the &s;uffrages of the people, &s;olicits the ac|quaintance of pea&s;ants and mechanics, and &s;eeks to draw whole nations to its &s;tandard.</P>
<P>It is not difficult to account for this new &s;tate of things. While infidelity was rare, it was employed as the in&s;trument of literary vanity; its wide diffu&s;ion having di&s;qualified it for an&s;wering that purpo&s;e, it is now adopted as the organ of political convul&s;ion. Li|terary di&s;tinction is conferred by the approbation of a few; but the total &s;ubver&s;ion and overthrow of &s;ociety demands the concurrence of millions.</P>
<P N="3">3. The infidels of the pre&s;ent day are the fir&s;t &s;o|phi&s;ts who have pre&s;umed to innovate in the very <HI>sub|stance</HI> of morals. The di&s;putes on moral que&s;tions hitherto agitated among&s;t philo&s;ophers have re&s;pected the <HI>grounds</HI> of duty, not the <HI>nature of duty itself;</HI> or they have been merely metaphy&s;ical, and related to the <HI>history</HI> of moral &s;entiments in the mind, the &s;ources and principles from which they were mo&s;t ea&s;ily de|duced; they never turned on the quality of tho&s;e di&s;|po&s;itions and actions which were to be denominated virtuous. In the firm per&s;ua&s;ion that the love and fear of the Supreme Being, the &s;acred ob&s;ervation of pro|mi&s;es and oaths, reverence to magi&s;trates, obedience to parents, gratitude to bene&s;actors, conjugal fidelity, and parental tenderne&s;s, were primary virtues; and the
<PB N="51" REF="037564_0049_10117200303AAE00">chief &s;upport of every commonwealth, they were una|nimous. The cur&s;e denounced upon &s;uch as remove ancient land marks, upon tho&s;e who call good evil and evil good, put light for darkne&s;s and darkne&s;s for light, who employ their faculties to &s;ubvert the eternal di&s;|tinctions of right and wrong, and thus to poi&s;on the &s;treams of virtue at their &s;ource, falls with accumu|lated weight on the advocates of modern infidelity, and on them alone.</P>
<P>Permit me to clo&s;e this di&s;cour&s;e with a few &s;erious reflections. There is much, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, in the apo&s;tacy of multitudes, and the rapid progre&s;s of infidelity, to awaken our fears for the virtue of the ri&s;ing generation; but nothing to &s;hake our faith, no|thing which &s;cripture it&s;elf does not give us room to expect. The features which compo&s;e the character of apo&s;tates, their prophanene&s;s, pre&s;umption, lewdne&s;s, impatience of &s;ubordination, re&s;tle&s;s appetite for change, vain preten&s;ions to freedom and to emancipate the world, whil&s;t them&s;elves are the &s;laves of lu&s;t, the weapons with which they attack Chri&s;tianity, and the &s;nares they &s;pread for the unwary, are depicted in the cleare&s;t colours by the pencil of prophecy. <HI>Knowing this first,</HI> &s;ays PETER, <HI>that there shall come, in the last days, scoffers, walking after their own lusts</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Peter, iii. v. 3.</NOTE>. In the &s;ame epi&s;tle he more fully de&s;cribes the per&s;ons he alludes to; <HI>as chiefly them that walk after the flesh, in the lust of uncleanness, and despise government; pre|sumptuous are they, self-willed, they are not afraid to speak evil of dignities; sporting themselves in their own deceivings, having eyes full of adultery, and that cannot cease from sin; beguiling unstable souls: For when they speak great swelling words of vanity, they allure through the lusts of the flesh, through much wantonness, those that were clean escaped from them

Fuller,</HI> entitled <HI>The Go&s;pel its own Witne&s;s.</HI> Sold by Mr. <HI>Button.</HI></NOTE>. Its enormities will ha&s;ten its overthrow. It is impo&s;&s;ible that a &s;y&s;tem, which, by vilifying every virtue, and embracing the patronage of almo&s;t every vice and crime, wages war with all the order and civilization of the world; which, equal to the e&s;tabli&s;hment of no|thing, is armed only with the energies of de&s;truction, can long retain an a&s;cendency. It is in no &s;hape formed for perpetuity. Sudden in its ri&s;e, and impetuous in its progre&s;s, it re&s;embles a mountain torrent, which is loud, filthy and de&s;olating; but, being fed by no peren|nial &s;pring, is &s;oon drained off and di&s;appears. By permitting to a certain extent the prevalence of infi|delity, Providence is preparing new triumphs for reli|gion. In afferting its authority, the preachers of the go&s;pel have hitherto found it nece&s;&s;ary to weigh the pro&s;pects of immortality again&s;t the intere&s;ts of time, to &s;trip the world of its charms, to in&s;i&s;t on the de|ceitfulne&s;s of plea&s;ure, the un&s;atisfying nature of rich|es, the emptine&s;s of grandeur, and the nothingne&s;s of
<PB N="53" REF="037564_0051_1011720624DA0178">a mere worldly life. Topics of this nature will always have their u&s;e; but it is not by &s;uch repre&s;entations alone, that the importance of religion is evinced. The prevalence of impiety has armed us with new weapons in its defence.</P>
<P>Religion being primarily intended to make men <HI>wise unto salvation,</HI> the &s;upport it mini&s;ters to &s;ocial order, the &s;tability it confers on government and laws, is a <HI>subordinate species</HI> of advantage which we &s;hould have continued to enjoy without reflecting on its cau&s;e, but for the developement of dei&s;tical principles and the ex|periment which has been made of their effects in a neighbouring country. It has been the con&s;tant boa&s;t of infidels, that their &s;y&s;tem, more liberal and gene|rous than Chri&s;tianity, needed but to be tried to pro|duce an immen&s;e acce&s;&s;ion of human happine&s;s; and Chri&s;tian nations, carele&s;s and &s;upine, retaining little of religion but the profe&s;&s;ion, and di&s;gu&s;ted with its re&s;traints, lent a favourable ear to the&s;e preten&s;ions.

<P>We might a&s;k the patrons of infidelity, what fury impels them to attempt the &s;ubver&s;ion of Chri&s;tianity? Is it that they have di&s;covered a better &s;y&s;tem? To what virtues are their principles favourable, or is there one which Chri&s;tians have not carried to a higher per|fection than any of whom their party can boa&s;t? Have they di&s;covered a more excellent rule of life, or a bet|ter hope in death, than that which the &s;criptures &s;ug|ge&s;t? Above all, what are the preten&s;ions on which they re&s;t their claims to be the guides of mankind; or which embolden them to expect we &s;hould trample upon the experience of ages, and abandon a religion, which has been atte&s;ted by a train of miracles and pro|phecies, in which millions of our forefathers have found a refuge in every trouble, and con&s;olation in the hour of death; a religion which has been adorned with the highe&s;t &s;anctity of character and &s;plendor of ta|lents, which enrols among&s;t its di&s;ciples the names of BACON, NEWTON, and LOCKE, the glory of their &s;pe|cies, and to which the&s;e illu&s;trious men were proud to dedicate the la&s;t and be&s;t fruits of their immortal ge|nius?</P>
<P>If the que&s;tion at i&s;&s;ue is to be decided by argument, nothing can be added to the triumph of Chri&s;tianity; if by an appeal to authority, what have our adver&s;aries to oppo&s;e to the&s;e great names? Where are the Infi|dels of &s;uch pure, uncontaminated morals, un&s;haken probity, and extended benevolence, that we &s;hould be in danger of being &s;educed into impiety by their ex|ample? Into what ob&s;cure rece&s;&s;es of mi&s;ery, into what dungeons, have their Philanthropi&s;ts penetrated, to lighten the fetters and relieve the &s;orrows of the help|le&s;s captive?

<P>More than all, their infatuated eagerne&s;s, their par|ricidal zeal to extingui&s;h a &s;en&s;e of Deity, mu&s;t excite a&s;toni&s;hment and horror.

<P>Having been led by the nature of the &s;ubject to con|&s;ider chiefly, the manner in which &s;ceptical impiety af|fects the welfare of &s;tates, it is the more requi&s;ite to warn you again&s;t that mo&s;t fatal mi&s;take of regarding religion as an engine of policy; and to recal to your recollection, that the concern we have in it, is much more as <HI>individuals</HI> than as <HI>collective bodies,</HI> and far le&s;s temporal than eternal. The happine&s;s it confers
<PB N="56" REF="037564_0054_1011720DF533CFE0">in the pre&s;ent life are ble&s;&s;ings which it &s;catters by the way in its march to immortality. That future condi|tion of being which it a&s;certains, and for which its promi&s;es and truths are meant to prepare us, is the ul|timate end of human &s;ocieties, the final &s;cope and ob|ject of pre&s;ent exi&s;tence, in compari&s;on of which all the revolutions of nations and all the vici&s;&s;itudes of time, are light and tran&s;itory. <HI>Godliness has,</HI> it is true, <HI>the promise of the life that now is,</HI> but chiefly <HI>of that which is to come.</HI> Other acqui&s;itions may be re|qui&s;ite to make men great; but, be a&s;&s;ured, the reli|gion of Je&s;us is alone &s;ufficient to make them good and happy. Powerful &s;ources of con&s;olation and &s;or|row, un&s;haken fortitude amid&s;t the changes and pertur|bations of the world, humility remote from meanne&s;s, and dignity un&s;tained by pride, contentment in every &s;tation, pa&s;&s;ions pure and calm, with habitual &s;erenity, full enjoyment of life, undi&s;turbed by the dread of di&s;|&s;olution, or the fear of an hereafter, are its in|valuable gifts. To the&s;e enjoyments, however, you will nece&s;&s;arily continue &s;trangers, unle&s;s you re&s;ign your&s;elves wholly to its power; for the con&s;olations of religion are re&s;erved to reward, to &s;weeten and to &s;ti|mulate to obedience. Many, without renouncing the profe&s;&s;ion of Chri&s;tianity, without formally rejecting its di&s;tingui&s;hing doctrines, live in &s;uch an habitual vi|olation of its laws, and contradiction to its &s;pirit, that, con&s;cious they have more to fear than to hope from its truth, they are never able to contemplate it without terror. It haunts their imagination, in&s;tead of tran|quillizing their hearts, and hangs with depre&s;&s;ing weight on all their enjoyments and pur&s;uits. Their religion, in&s;tead of comforting them under their troubles, is it|&s;elf their greate&s;t trouble, from which they &s;eek refuge in the di&s;&s;ipation and vanity of the world, until the throbs and tumults of con&s;cience force them back upon religion. Thus &s;u&s;pended betwixt oppo&s;ite powers, the &s;port of contradictory influences, they are di&s;qua|lified for the happine&s;s of both worlds, and neither en|joy
<PB N="57" REF="037564_0055_1011721103DB7CE0">the plea&s;ures of &s;in, nor the peace of piety. Is it &s;urpri&s;ing to find a mind thus bewildered in uncertain|ty, and di&s;&s;atisfied with it&s;elf, court deception, and embrace with eagerne&s;s every pretext to mutilate the claims and enervate the authority of Chri&s;tianity, for|getting that it is the very e&s;&s;ence of the religious prin|ciples to pre&s;ide and control, and that it is impo&s;&s;ible to <HI>serve God and Mammon?</HI> It is this cla&s;s of profe&s;&s;ors, who are chiefly in danger of being entangled in the &s;nares of infidelity.</P>
<P>The champions of infidelity have much more rea&s;on to be a&s;hamed, than to boa&s;t, of &s;uch converts. For what can be a &s;tronger pre&s;umption of the &s;al&s;ehood of a &s;y&s;tem, than that it is the opiate of a re&s;tle&s;s con&s;ci|ence; that it prevails with minds of a certain de&s;crip|tion, not becau&s;e they find it true; but becau&s;e they feel it nece&s;&s;ary; and that in adopting it, they con&s;ult le&s;s with their rea&s;on, than with their vices and their fears? It requires but little &s;agacity to fore&s;ee that &s;pecu|lations which originate in guilt, mu&s;t end in ruin. Infi|dels are not them&s;elves &s;atisfied with the truth of their &s;y&s;|tem; for, had they any &s;ettled a&s;&s;urance of its princi|ples, in con&s;equence of calm di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate inve&s;tigation, they would never di&s;turb the quiet of the world by their attempts to pro&s;elyte; but would lament their own infelicity, in not being able to perceive &s;uffi|cient evidence for the truth of a religion, which fur|ni&s;hes &s;uch incentives to virtue, and in&s;pires &s;uch exalt|ed hopes. Having nothing to &s;ub&s;titute in the place of religion, it is ab&s;urd to &s;uppo&s;e that, in oppo&s;ition to the collective voice of every country, age, and time, proclaiming its nece&s;&s;ity, &s;olicitude for the welfare of mankind impels them to de&s;troy it.</P>
<P>To very different motives mu&s;t their conduct be im|puted. More like con&s;pirators than philo&s;ophers, in &s;pice of the darkne&s;s with which they endeavour to &s;ur|round them&s;elves, &s;ome rays of unwelcome conviction will penetrate, &s;ome &s;ecret apprehen&s;ions that all is not
<PB N="58" REF="037564_0056_10117213E25E7A28">right, will make them&s;elves felt, which they find no|thing &s;o effectual to quell as an attempt to enli&s;t fre&s;h di&s;ciples, who, in exchange for new principles, impart confidence, and dimini&s;h fear. For the &s;ame rea&s;on it is &s;eldom they attack Chri&s;tianity by argument: their favourite weapons are ridicule, ob&s;cenity and bla&s;phe|my; as the mo&s;t mi&s;erable outca&s;ts of &s;ociety are, of all men, found mo&s;t to delight in vulgar merriment and &s;en&s;ele&s;s riot.</P>
<P>JESUS CHRIST &s;eems to have <HI>his fan in his hand and to be thoroughly purging his floor;</HI> and nominal Chri&s;|tians will probably be &s;cattered like chaff. But has <HI>real</HI> Chri&s;tianity any thing to fear? Have not the degene|rate manners, and corrupt lives, of multitudes in the vi|&s;ible Church, been, on the contrary, the principal occa|&s;ion of &s;candal and offence? Infidelity, without intend|ing it, is gradually removing this reproach: po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the property of attracting to it&s;elf the morbid humours which pervade the Church, until the Chri&s;tian profe&s;|&s;ion on the one hand is reduced to a &s;ound and healthy &s;tate, and Sceptici&s;m on the other, exhibits nothing but a ma&s;s of putridity and di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>In a view of the final i&s;&s;ue of the conte&s;t, we &s;hould find little cau&s;e to lament the a&s;toni&s;hing prevalence of Infidelity, but for a &s;olicitude for the ri&s;ing generation: to whom its principles are recommended by two mo|tives, with young minds the mo&s;t per&s;ua&s;ive, the love of independence, and the love of plea&s;ure. With re&s;|pect to the fir&s;t, we would earne&s;tly entreat the young to remember, that by the unanimous con&s;ent of all ages, mode&s;ty, docility and reverence to &s;uperior years, and to parents, above all, have been con&s;idered as their <HI>ap|propriate virtues,</HI> a guard a&s;&s;igned by the immutable laws of God and nature on the inexperience of youth; and with re&s;pect to the &s;econd, that Chri&s;tianity prohibits no plea&s;ures that are innocent, lays no re&s;traints that are capricious; but that the &s;obriety and purity which it enjoins, by &s;trengthning the intellectual powers, and pre|&s;erving
<PB N="59" REF="037564_0057_10117219729BCB98">the faculties of mind and body in undimini&s;hed vigour, lay <HI>the surest</HI> foundation of pre&s;ent peace and future eminence. At &s;uch a &s;ea&s;on as this, it becomes an urgent duty on Parents, Guardians and Tutors, to watch, not only over the morals, but the principles of tho&s;e committed to their care; to make it appear that a concern for their eternal welfare is their chief concern, and to imbue them early with that knowledge of the evidences of Chri&s;tianity, and that profound reverence for the Scriptures, that with the ble&s;&s;ing of God, (which with &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion they may then expect) <HI>may keep them from this hour of temptation that has come upon all the world, to try them that dwell on the earth.</HI></P>
<P>To an attentive ob&s;erver of the &s;igns of the times, it will appear one of the mo&s;t extraordinary phaenomena of this eventful cri&s;is, that amid&s;t the ravages of Athe|i&s;m and Infidelity, real Religion is evidently on the in|crea&s;e. <HI>The Kingdom of God,</HI> we know, <HI>cometh not with observation;</HI> but &s;till there are not wanting mani|fe&s;t tokens of its approach. The per&s;onal appearance of the Son of God was announced by the &s;haking of na|tions: his &s;piritual Kingdom, in all probability, will be e&s;tabli&s;hed in the mid&s;t of &s;imilar convul&s;ions and di&s;or|ders. The bla&s;phemous impiety of the enemies of God, as well as the zealous efforts of his &s;incere wor|&s;hippers, will doubtle&s;s be overruled to accompli&s;h the purpo&s;es of his unerring providence: while, in inflict|ing the cha&s;ti&s;ements of offended Deity on corrupt com|munities and nations, Infidelity marks its progre&s;s by deva&s;tation and ruin, by the pro&s;tration of Thrones and concu&s;&s;ion of Kingdoms; thus apalling the inhabitants of the world, and compelling them to take refuge in the Church of God, the true &s;anctuary; the &s;tream of divine knowledge unob&s;erved is flowing in new channels, winding its cour&s;e among humble vallies, refre&s;hing thir&s;ty de&s;erts, and enriching, with far other and higher ble&s;&s;ings than tho&s;e of commerce, the mo&s;t di&s;tant climes and nations, until, agreeably to the prediction of prophe|cy,
<PB N="60" REF="037564_0058_1011721AF567FB58">the <HI>knowledge of the Lord shall fill and cover the whole earth.</HI></P>
<P>Within the limits of this di&s;cour&s;e, it would be im|practicable to exhibit the evidences of Chri&s;tianity, nor is it my de&s;ign; but there is one con&s;ideration re&s;ulting immediately from my text, which is entitled to great weight with all who believe in the one living and true God, as the &s;ole object of wor&s;hip. The Ephe&s;ians, in common with other Gentiles, are de&s;cribed in the text as being, previous to their conver&s;ion, <HI>without God in the world;</HI> that is, without any ju&s;t and &s;olid acquain|tance with his character, de&s;titute of the knowledge of his will, the in&s;titutes of his wor&s;hip, and the hopes of his favour; to the truth of which repre&s;entation whoe|ver po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the &s;lighte&s;t acquaintance with Pagan anti|quity, mu&s;t a&s;&s;ent; nor is it a fact le&s;s inconte&s;tible, that while human philo&s;ophy was never able to aboli&s;h idola|try in a &s;ingle village, the promulgation of the Go&s;pel overthrew it in a great part (and that the mo&s;t enlight|ened) of the world. If the unity and perfections of God, together with his moral government and exclu&s;ive right to the wor&s;hip of mankind, are truths, they cannot rea&s;onably be denied to be truths of the fir&s;t importance, and infinitely to outweigh the greate&s;t di&s;coveries in &s;cience; becau&s;e they turn the hopes, fears and inter|e&s;ts of man into a totally different channel from that in which they mu&s;t otherwi&s;e flow.

<HEAD>Note to Page <HI>36.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>The fury of the mo&s;t &s;anguinary parties was e&s;pecially pointed again&s;t the Chri&s;tian prie&s;thood,</HI> &amp;c.]&mdash;The Author finds he has given great offence to &s;ome friends whom he highly e&s;teems, by applying the term <HI>Chri&s;tian prie&s;thood</HI> to the popi&s;h clergy. He begs leave to make a remark or two by way of apology.</P>
<P N="1">1. It is admitted by all candid prote&s;tants, that &s;alvation is attainable in the Roman Catholic church; but he &s;hould be glad to be informed what part of the Chri&s;tian covenant entitles us to expect the &s;alvation of tho&s;e (where the Go&s;pel is promul|gated) who are not even a branch of the vi&s;ible church of Chri&s;t. The papi&s;tical tenets are either <HI>fundamentally</HI> errone|ous on which &s;uppo&s;ition it is certain to papi&s;t can be &s;aved, or their errors mu&s;t be con&s;i&s;tent with Chri&s;tian faith, and con|&s;equently cannot be a valid rea&s;on for excluding tho&s;e who maintain them from being a part (a mo&s;t corrupt part, if you plea&s;e, but &s;till a part) of the Chri&s;tian church.</P>
<P N="2">2. The popi&s;h clergy were per&s;ecuted under the <HI>character of Chri&s;tians,</HI> not under the notion of Heretics or Schi&s;matics. They, who were the &s;ubjects of per&s;ecution, were certainly the be&s;t judges of its aim and direction: and when the Archbi&s;hop of Paris, and others, endeavoured to &s;creen them&s;elves from its effects by a recantation, what did they recant? Was it popery? no; but the profe&s;&s;ion of Chri&s;tianity. The&s;e Apo&s;|tates, doubtle&s;s, meant to remove the ground of offence, which, in their opinion, was the Chri&s;tian profe&s;&s;ion. If the &s;ounde&s;t Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Hi&s;torians have not refu&s;ed the honours of mar|tyrdom to &s;uch as &s;uffered in the cau&s;e of truth among&s;t the Gno&s;tics, it ill becomes the liberality of the pre&s;ent age to contemplate, with &s;ullen indifference, or malicious joy, the &s;ufferings of con&s;cientious catholics.</P>
<P N="3">3. At the period to which the Author refers Chri&s;tian wor|&s;hip, of <HI>every kind,</HI> was prohibited, while, in &s;olemn mockery of religion, adoration was paid to a &s;trumpet, under the title of the godde&s;s of rea&s;on. Is it nece&s;&s;ary to prove that men, who were thus abandoned, mu&s;t be ho&s;tile to true religion, under every form? or, if there be any gradations in their abhorrence, to that mo&s;t which is the mo&s;t pure and perfect? Are athei&s;m and
<PB N="63" REF="037564_0061_1011722263BDB820">ob&s;cenity more congenial to the prote&s;tant than to the popi&s;h profe&s;&s;ion? To have incurred the hatred of the ruling party of France at the &s;ea&s;on alluded to, is an honour which the author would be &s;orry to re&s;ign, as the exclu&s;ive boa&s;t of the church of Rome: to have been the object of the partiality of &s;uch bloody and inhuman mon&s;ters, would have been a &s;tain upon Prote&s;|tants which the virtue of ages could not obliterate.</P>
