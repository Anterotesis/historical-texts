<P>"And when the children of I&s;rael &s;aw it they &s;aid one to another, it is <HI>MANNA,</HI> for they wi&s;t not what it was. And <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> &s;aid unto them, this is the bread which the <HI>Lord</HI> hath given you to eat."</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE children of I&s;rael, in their travels through the de&s;erts of Arabia towards the land of Canaan, murmured again&s;t Mo&s;es and again&s;t the Lord becau&s;e the &s;canty &s;tores they brought from Egypt were nearly exhau&s;ted, and they were ignorant of the means for a new re|cruit. In particular they wanted <HI>bread.</HI> They were gratified by a miraculous providential &s;up|ply. Bread was granted them&mdash;BREAD FROM HEAV|EN! my&s;terious in its origin and character, but highly agreeable in its reli&s;h, &s;alutary in its na|ture and nutritive in its qualities.</P>

THERE are circum&s;tances, connected with its be&s;towment and reception, de&s;erving our par|ticular notice; and the &s;ubject will lead to &s;ome reflections applicable to the &s;ociety on who&s;e ac|count we a&s;&s;emble. With this view I propo&s;e the following method.</P>

</LIST>
<P>WE are, <HI>fir&s;t</HI> then to <HI>con&s;ider what notice was taken by the I&s;raelites of the provi&s;ion and refre&s;h|ment furni&s;hed them by a &s;pecial divine providence in the de&s;erts of Arabia.</HI></P>
<P>NO &s;ooner did they &s;ee it than they cried out one to another <HI>"it is manna, it it manna,</HI> for they knew not what it was." Whether this was an exclamation of &s;urprize, a que&s;tion of curio&s;ity, or an expre&s;&s;ion of contempt, we &s;hall not decide. Critics and commentators &s;eem at a lo&s;s how to under&s;tand it. One &s;ays it is <HI>this</HI> and another <HI>that,</HI> for they know not what it is.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide POLI &s;ynops. criticorum, in loc.</NOTE> However, it
<PB N="7" REF="032229_0006_0FF19BF701432690">is plain enough that <HI>manna,</HI> let it mean what it will, was not the proper definition nor de&s;crip|tion of the admirable provi&s;ion.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">The derivation of the word <HI>manna</HI> is variou&s;ly given by learned men. PHILO JUDAUS and JOSEPHUS make it to &s;ignify? <HI>what is this?</HI> and &s;o do the ixx. and R. SOLOMON, R. MINACHEN, &amp; others. Accordingly it is thus tran&s;lated in MATTHEW'S, the GENEVA, and DOWAY ver&s;ions. It is &s;o rendered, al&s;o, by the celebrated Dr. GEDDES. But COV|ERDALE renders it <HI>"this is mans;"</HI> our tran&s;lation, <HI>"it is manna,"</HI> and others; <HI>"it is a portion,"</HI>&mdash;The declaration that "they knew not what it was, and the reply of MOSES, would lead one to &s;uppo&s;e that the phra&s;e before was a <HI>que&s;tion.</HI> Our only &s;urpri&s;e is that it &s;hould afterwards pa&s;s into a de&s;criptive <HI>name.</HI> Thus <HI>we</HI> u&s;ed a very vulgar phra&s;e in &s;peaking of &s;ome thing of which we have forgotten the name, and &s;ay <HI>"the what do you call it."</HI></NOTE> And &s;o Mo&s;es informed them by telling them, "this is the bread which the Lord hath given you to eat." Not|with&s;tanding, they per&s;i&s;ted in giving their own opinion of it, tho they were unacquainted both with its name and nature.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Compare Deut. viii. 3. where Mo&s;es expre&s;sly a&s;&s;erts their entire ignorance of it.</NOTE>! What a &s;trange con|tradiction! But not &s;tranger than all are likely to fall into who pretend to decide upon matters which they do not under&s;tand. "They &s;aid one to another it is manna;" and <HI>manna</HI> it has been called ever &s;ince. It is no ea&s;y matter to alter names. When people misjudge at fir&s;t, it is
<PB N="8" REF="032229_0007_0FF19BFB52C7C8F8">very difficult to rectify their opinion. Igno|rance is blind and perver&s;e; prejudice is po&s;itive and ob&s;tinate. What is mi&s;conceived and mi&s;|applied &s;eldom afterwards retrieves its real e&s;ti|mation. Men are apt to judge at large, reflect at random and condemn at a venture; without waiting for patient examination or &s;atisfactory evidence. Now, nothing can be more contrary both to equity and &s;ound rea&s;on than &s;uch pre|cipitate judgments. Tho&s;e who build opinions upon conjectures mu&s;t often be in the wrong. They may make gro&s;s blunders, and do great in|ju&s;tice. The apo&s;tle Jude gives &s;uch a rebuke: "The&s;e, &s;ays he, &s;peak evil of the things they know not."&mdash;It has been the practice of vulgar ignorance to abu&s;e what it could not compre|hend; and to a&s;&s;ert that there mu&s;t be faults, where it had not the &s;agacity to di&s;cover excel|lence.</P>
<P>I. BUT I proceed to <HI>enquire what this wonder|ful provi&s;ion really was, about which they were &s;o ig|norant.</HI>&mdash;That there &s;hould no doubt remain in the minds of tho&s;e to whom it was &s;ent, Mo&s;es in|formed them that it was <HI>the bread which the Lord had given them to cat.</HI> In like manner David calls it "the corn of heaven," and "angels food."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P&s;al. lxxviii. 24, 25.

<PB N="9" REF="032229_0008_0FF19BFE43CE1348">Scripture de&s;cribes particularly its appearance and properties, and mentions its coming down with the dew; alike the gift of refre&s;hment from above. And it retains &s;till its fame in the Ea&s;t, being called "cele&s;tial &s;weetmeat."<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Les orientaux appellent la manne qui tomba aux He|breux dans le De&s;ert, la Drag&eacute;e ou Con&s;iture de la Tours Pui&s;&s;ance, ce que les Arabes &s;ignifient par Haluat al Kod|rat, et les Turcs par Kodret Kalva&s;i."

Orientale.</HI> The Greeks called it <HI>acromeli, acrial honey.</HI> ATH|RN. l. 11. &amp; DIOS. <HI>lib.</HI> 2. <HI>cap.</HI> 101.</NOTE> Nor can there be any propriety in denying to the gift its real character and intrin&s;ic value, becau&s;e its appear|ance was not prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing. It is &s;ufficient that <HI>its origin was divine, and its u&s;es excellent.</HI> If this could not recommend it, we may expect that the be&s;t things and riche&s;t ble&s;&s;ings will be treated with neglect or &s;purned with contempt.</P>
<P>THAT <HI>it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed remarkably palatable and nu|tritive qualities</HI> is evident both from the divine de&s;ign of its be&s;towment, and from its u&s;e. The author of the book of Wi&s;dom &s;ays that it &s;o ac|commodated it&s;elf to every one's ta&s;te as to prove agreeable to all. His words are, "thou fedde&s;t thine own people with angels food, and did&s;t &s;end them from heaven bread prepared without their labor; able to content every man's delight, and agreeing to every ta&s;te. For thy &s;u&s;tenance
<PB N="10" REF="032229_0009_0FF19C001246FC50">declared thy &s;weetne&s;s unto thy children, and, &s;erving to the appetite of the eater and tempered it&s;elf to every man's liking."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Wi&s;dom xvi. 20.21.</NOTE></P>
<P>FROM modern &s;amples of this &s;ub&s;tance, as it is gathered in the Ea&s;t, we perceive that it has the appearance of conden&s;ed honey, and a ta&s;te of agreeable &s;weetne&s;s. A late celebrated travel|ler into Arabia &s;ays, "it is u&s;ed now as &s;ugar in &s;everal di&s;hes&mdash;it is nouri&s;hing&mdash;and when new|ly gathered has no purgative qualities."<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">NICBUHR, v 2. p. 362 <HI>of the tran&s;lation</HI>&mdash;and Father PINOLO, de&s;cribing that of California which falls as is &s;up|po&s;ed with the dew, &s;ays, that, without the whitene&s;s of refin|ed &s;ugar, it has all its &s;weetne&s;s.</NOTE> Its me|dicinal effects are probably occa&s;ioned by its being left &s;ome time; in con&s;equence of which it fo|ments in a degree, becomes candyed, and lo&s;es its reli&s;hing ta&s;te and nutritive properties.&mdash;To the I&s;raelites, who were obliged to con&s;ume, each day, their given portion, it afforded an agreeable, nouri&s;hing, whole&s;ome repa&s;t; and was their principal aliment during a period of forty years.&mdash;Though liable to corruption, it did not become bad unle&s;s improperly u&s;ed or unlaw|fully abu&s;ed.<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Exod. xvi. 20.</NOTE> And the be&s;t things are per|verted and deba&s;ed by ill u&s;age.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="032229_0010_0FF19C0498E06880">
IT is al&s;o worthy of remark that <HI>it had moral tendencies.</HI> It was granted in daily &s;howers, that they might be kept in a continual thankful de|pendance upon divine providence. It was in &s;uch &s;mall grains, and was &s;o &s;cattered, that they were obliged early and &s;ea&s;onably to begin their work of collecting it, or they would fail of a &s;upply. Thus were they taught <HI>indu&s;try;</HI> and learned that their own endeavors were to be united to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance and to cooperate with the grace of GOD. And a double portion on the la&s;t day of the week, and its non-appearance on the &s;abbath, gave them a very &s;triking intimation that the in&s;titution of a day of actual re&s;t from labor was to be religiou&s;ly and devoutly ob&s;erved.</P>
<P>THE manner too in which it was di&s;tributed was admirably calculated to excite and encour|age a &s;pirit of <HI>liberality</HI> and <HI>genero&s;ity,</HI> a willing|ne&s;s to impart to tho&s;e who&s;e indu&s;try had been le&s;s &s;ucce&s;sful, or who were unable to gather for their &s;elves: for in mea&s;uring their re&s;pective gatherings before they went to their tents, tho&s;e who had collected a greater quantity than &s;ufficed for their immediate need or u&s;e freely gave the overplus to tho&s;e who had not enough. "So that he who gathered much had nothing over, &amp; he that gather|ed little had no lack." In this &s;en&s;e the words are under&s;tood by the Apo&s;tle, 2 Cor. viii. 14, 15. who u&s;es the pa&s;&s;age as an apt illu&s;tration of his
<PB N="12" REF="032229_0011_0FF19C07A5159B48">mo&s;t excellent argument for that happy <HI>equality,</HI> in the di&s;tribution of the good things of this life, which our mutual relation to each other and par|ticular exigencies may requires; that he who abounds &s;hould willingly impart of his &s;uperfluity, &s;o that he who is de&s;titute may obtain a compe|tent &s;upply.</P>
<P>IT would be ea&s;y to point out the very &s;trik|ing re&s;emblance which FREE MASONRY bears to the <HI>moral qualities and purpo&s;es</HI> here enumerated; but it is too obvious to need a more particular reference. I &s;hall, therefore, go on to make one more remark, in which the analogy is al&s;o ap|parent.</P>
<P>AFTER all, <HI>there were &s;ome things in the nature of this heavenly provi&s;ion which could not ea&s;ily be accounted for.</HI> Where it was <HI>prepared,</HI> and how it was <HI>made,</HI> they could not tell. There they were in the dark.&mdash;Why the &s;ame &s;ub&s;tance which melted and evaporated in the heat of the &s;un when it was left expo&s;ed in the field, &s;hould, only upon being brought into the tent, become of &s;o conden&s;ed a con&s;i&s;tence that it might be beaten to powder in a mortar or ground in a mill, and baked in an oven,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Numb. xi. 9.</NOTE> was beyond their com|prehen&s;ion. And why it &s;hould be endued with
<PB N="13" REF="032229_0012_0FF19C0A94BB0990">&s;uch a religious reference to the ob&s;ervations of the &s;abbath that none fell on that day, and a double quantity the day before was a circum|&s;tance that excited their &s;urprize. Surprize &s;ometimes degenerates into &s;tupidity. Oftener than once they di&s;pi&s;ed and loathed this mira|culous and delicious provi&s;ion.</P>
<P>SUCH is the pride of the human under&s;tanding that it has no great opinion of that which it can|not fully comprehend. Whatever has any thing of my&s;tery in it is very likely to be &s;light|ed. Though it po&s;&s;e&s;s all the characters of excellence, and all the recommendations of util|ity, yet if it elude inve&s;tigation and have &s;ome &s;ecret qualities "pa&s;t finding out," doubt will be immediately entertained whether it be "wor|thy of all acceptation;" And opinions propo|gated tending to le&s;&s;en its character and deny its importance.&mdash;This was the ca&s;e with regard to the heavenly refre&s;hment furni&s;hed in the wilderne&s;s to the I&s;raelites. They valued it not becau&s;e they lacked "the onions, the leeks, and garlicks of Egypt." &iexcl;Hear their di&s;contented &s;neers.! "But now our &s;oul is dried away; there is nothing at all, be&s;ides this manna, before our eyes."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Numb. xvi. 6.</NOTE> &mdash;A like &s;pirit of di&s;approbation and rejection the &s;ame nation di&s;covered of

This, and the former circum&s;tance with which it was compared, could be only from PREJUDICE: for prejudice is a judgment formed before hand without examination. How unrea&s;onable and unju&s;t mu&s;t &s;uch a judgment be!<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot"><Q><L>"Qui &s;tatuit aliquid, parte inaudita altera,</L>

<BIBL><HI>Seneca in Medea.</HI></BIBL></Q></NOTE>
And how great a bar to all after information! For, if the mind be warped by prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, free enquiry into the merits of a cau&s;e is prevented. Prejudice re&s;trains all candid interpretations of motives or principles. It di&s;colors every object; or repre&s;ents it in a fal&s;e light. It leads to a deci&s;ion equally ungenerous and unfair; for it often pre&s;umes to con&s;ider the mo&s;t &s;light and frivolous circum&s;tances as &s;atisfactory materials for con&s;ident a&s;&s;ertion and deci&s;ive &s;en|tence. It is the immediate and copious &s;ource of evil &s;urmi&s;es and unkind &s;u&s;picions. It gives ri&s;e to a caviling cen&s;oriou&s;ne&s;s, mean in&s;inua|tions,
<PB N="15" REF="032229_0014_0FF19C0E0EF41060">and &s;arca&s;tic &s;neers.&mdash;Wherever there is a &s;ecret bias of mind previou&s;ly formed, it will catch readily at every little incident and appear|ance to increa&s;e its own propen&s;ion: and turn every current of ob&s;ervation into its own corrupt channel.&mdash;It perverts and mi&s;repre&s;ents the very be&s;t things: turns honor into di&s;grace, merit in|to mi&s;chief, chri&s;tianity into &s;uper&s;tition, and virtue into vice.</P>
<P>CAUTIONED and in&s;tru&s;ted by our &s;ubject, and the remarks which it has &s;ugge&s;ted, let us not, MY HEARERS, form our opinion either of per&s;ons or things too ha&s;tily; and never proceed upon &s;ur|mi&s;es and precarious conjectures. There is dan|ger in making up a precipitate judgment. Ha&s;ty conclu&s;ions are the chief cau&s;e of all our mi&s;takes and errors. Let us not forget to examine be|fore we judge; and to under&s;tand before we de|cide. To ridicule things we never took pains to enquire into, would be unfair. To condemn practices, the grounds and foundation of which we never examined and know nothing about. would be unju&s;t and cruel. A di&s;creet per&s;on will avoid being preremptory in his remarks, and decline hazarding an opinion upon that of which he is either totally ignorant, or but partially informed. He follows the prudent coun&s;el of
<PB N="16" REF="032229_0015_0FF19C1697FFB8F8">the antient Wi&s;e Man; "blame not before thou ha&s;t examined the truth. Under&s;tand fir&s;t, and then rebuke. An&s;wer not before thou ha&s;t heard the cau&s;e; and &s;trive not in a matter that con|cerneth thee not."&mdash;"He that an&s;wereth a matter before he heareth it, it is folly and &s;hame unto him."&mdash;Upon the &s;ame principle of equity is that maxim in Common Law, "every man is pre&s;um|ed to be innocent till he is proved to be guilty." No one is to be arraigned without evidence, nor condemned before he has made his plea of de|fence. Verdict is never pa&s;&s;ed upon a cau&s;e un|heard.</P>
<P>It is a good rule in all doubtful matters to &s;u&s;pend our opinion, at lea&s;t till po&s;itive proof is obtained on which to found it. Until we have fully a&s;certained the real &s;tate of the ca&s;e, let us always be willing to put the faire&s;t con&s;truction it will admit; and even to hope the be&s;t of a thing where appearances are again&s;t it. Where <HI>doubt</HI> he&s;itates, let <HI>candor</HI> prompt; and where <HI>ju&s;tice</HI> balances let <HI>mercy</HI> prevail. Even where we find our&s;elves obliged to blame the principles of a certain &s;ect or party, let us not be &s;o uncharitable as to confound all its adherents and followers under one general indi&s;criminate cen&s;ure.

<P N="3">III, TO <HI>inquire what is &s;aid of</HI> FREE MASONRY <HI>by tho&s;e who "know not what it is."</HI></P>
<P>THE opinion of the initiated is well known. They all unite in commending the Society with a warmth that borders upon enthu&s;ia&s;m. They di&s;cover an attachment to it, at which <HI>ignorance</HI> wonders and <HI>prejudice</HI> &s;neers.</P>
<P>ONE of the mo&s;t frequent objections urged again&s;t FREE MASONRY is <HI>"the profound &s;ecrecy ob&s;erved upon certain parts of the in&s;titution."</HI> It is queried how it is con&s;i&s;tent with tho&s;e principles of good will we profe&s;s, to conceal any thing from the world. We an&s;wer, that, to the wi&s;e and virtuous the arcana of the Craft, under prop|er &s;anctions, are freely communicated. But to reveal them to the ignorant and vicious would be pro&s;tituting their purpo&s;e and profaning their &s;anctity. To divulge them in common would be to annihilate the &s;ociety: becau&s;e they are its di&s;tingui&s;hing features, the character|ri&s;tics of the order, and the means of its pre&s;er|vation. Without them, therefore, it could not &s;ub&s;i&s;t.&mdash;Be&s;ides, were all men acquainted with them, without regard to &s;election or de&s;ert, <HI>the
<PB N="19" REF="032229_0018_0FF19C19B5F16708">peculiar obligation to good offices</HI> ari&s;ing from the in&s;titution would revert back to the general duty of all mankind, and be &s;ubject to all tho&s;e de|ductions it now meets with in the world at large, and again&s;t which it is our fir&s;t principle to guard.&mdash;</P>
<P>HOWEVER, to have &s;ecrets is not peculiar to FREE MASONRY. Every trade, every art, and every occupation, has its &s;ecrets, not to be communicated but to &s;uch as have become proficients in the &s;cience connected with them, nor then but with proper caution and re&s;triction; and oftentimes under the guard of heavy pen|alties. Charters of incorporation are granted by civil Governments for their greater &s;ecurity, and patents for their encouragement.&mdash;Nay every Government, every &s;tate&s;man, and every individ|vidual, has &s;ecrets, which are concealed with prudent care, and confided only in the tru&s;ty and true.</P>
<P>NOTHING more &s;urely, need be &s;aid in apol|ogy for the my&s;tery and concealment FREE MASONS profe&s;s.&mdash;I will proceed to another objection allied to the foregoing, which <HI>igno|rance</HI> al&s;o has &s;urmi&s;ed and <HI>prejudice</HI> prop|agated.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="032229_0019_0FF19C1B5BE309C0">
IT is pretended that <HI>"all who are initiated mu&s;t &s;wear to conceal certain &s;ecrets before they are communicated to them, or they have it in their power to examine their nature and tendency: and that this practice is unlawful."</HI> There would be &s;ome force in this objection were the obligation in it&s;elf immoral, or the communications &amp; requirements compatible with the great laws of religion or civil &s;ociety: the very rever&s;e of which is the ca&s;e.</P>
<P>WHAT the ignorant call "the oath" is &s;imply an obligation, covenant, and promi&s;e, exacted previou&s;ly to the divulging of our means of recog|nizing each other, that they &s;hall be kept from the knowledge of the world, le&s;t their original intent &s;hould be thwarted and their benevolent purport prevented.&mdash;Now? pray what harm is there in this?? Do you not all, when you have any thing of a private nature which you are willing to confide in a particular friend <HI>before you tell him what it is,</HI> demand a &s;olemn promi&s;e of &s;ecrecy? And,? is there not the utmo&s;t propri|ety in knowing whether your friend is deter|mined to conceal your &s;ecret <HI>before</HI> you pre&s;ume to reveal it? Your an&s;wer confutes your cavil.&mdash;</P>
<P>IT is further urged again&s;t FREE MASONS that <HI>"Their &s;ociety is not founded on univer&s;al
<PB N="21" REF="032229_0020_0FF19C1F9F327340">benevolence, becau&s;e they oblige their &s;elves to be kind|e&s;t and mo&s;t generous to their own members."</HI> We ad|mit the truth of the declaration that our fir&s;t and choice&s;t &s;ervices are paid to our brethren: but then we think it would be the greate&s;t in|ju&s;tice if it were otherwi&s;e. Certainly a di&s;|crimination ought to be made between the de&s;erv|ing and the under&s;erving; tho&s;e who have a claim upon our a&s;&s;i&s;tance and charity, and tho&s;e who have not. So the Apo&s;tle exhorts the Chri&s;tians to do good as they have opportunity to all men; but enjoins their &s;pecial and di&s;tingui&s;hing re|gards to &s;uch as are of the hou&s;ehold of faith.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Galat. vi. 10.</NOTE></P>
<P>YET though we give a decided preference to &s;uch as have been tried, and proved, and found to be worthy; and have, in con&s;equence, been made members of the ma&s;onic family; we are known to profe&s;s and practice charity unconfined and liberality unlimited, and to comprehend in the wide circle of our benevolence the whole human race.</P>
<P>IT is, al&s;o, frequently argued again&s;t FREE MASONRY that <HI>"&s;ome of tho&s;e who belong to it are intemperate, profligate, and vicious."</HI> But nothing can be more unfair or unju&s;t than to depreciate or condemn any in&s;titution, good in it&s;elf, on ac|count
<PB N="22" REF="032229_0021_0FF19C22983622A8">of the faults of tho&s;e who pretend to ad|here to it. The abu&s;e of a thing is no valid ob|jection to its inherent goodne&s;s. Worthle&s;s characters are to be found, occa&s;ionally, in the very be&s;t in&s;titutions upon earth. "If the un|worthine&s;s of a profe&s;&s;or ca&s;ts a reflection upon the profe&s;&s;ion, it may be infered, by parity of rea&s;on, that the mi&s;conduct of a chri&s;tian is an argument again&s;t chri&s;tianity. But this, is a conclu&s;ion which, I pre&s;ume, no man will allow; and yet it is no more than what <HI>he</HI> mu&s;t &s;ub&s;cribe who is &s;o unrea&s;onable as to in&s;i&s;t on the other."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the excellent &s;ermon of the Rev. Brother BROCK|WELL, preached at Bo&s;ton, 1749.</NOTE> Nor is it any evidence that Civil Laws and Polit|ical In&s;titutions are hurtful or un&s;erviceable be|cau&s;e there are corrupt citizens and di&s;orderly members of a community.</P>
<P>THE fact is, the be&s;t things may be abu&s;ed. The <HI>bread of heaven</HI> grew corrupt when u&s;ed in|di&s;cretely. The common ble&s;&s;ings of life are turned into cur&s;es if mi&s;applied.</P>
<P>WHEN you &s;ee ba&s;e and unworthy men among the FREE MASONS, depend upon it, the fault is not in the In&s;titution, but in their &s;elves. They have deviated from the principles of the
<PB N="23" REF="032229_0022_0FF19C2428840E18">Craft. They have counteracted their profe&s;&s;ion: and are as bad ma&s;ons as men.</P>
<P>WE do not he&s;itate to appeal to the world in ju&s;tifi|cation of the purity of our moral &s;y&s;tem. Our <HI>Con|&s;titutions</HI> are well known. We have &s;ubmitted them freely to general inve&s;tigation. We &s;ol|emnly avouch them as the principles by which we are governed, the foundation on which we build, and the rules by which we work. We challenge the mo&s;t &s;evere critic, the mo&s;t preci&s;e morali&s;t, the mo&s;t perfect chri&s;tian, to point out any thing in them incon&s;i&s;tent with good man|ners, fair morals, or pure religion. We feel a&s;|&s;ured that every one who will take pains to con|&s;ult the book mu&s;t be convinced that the in&s;titution is friendly to the be&s;t intere&s;ts of mankind, well calculated to meliorate the di&s;po&s;ition &amp; improve the human character, &amp; to adorn its faithful adher|ents with every natural, &s;ocial and religious virtue.</P>
<P N="4">IV. THIS remark leads me to &s;hew as I pro|po&s;ed, in the la&s;t place, <HI>what</HI> FREE MASONRY <HI>real|ly is.</HI></P>
<P>IT is <HI>a moral order</HI> of enlightened men, found|ed on a &s;ublime, rational, and manly PIETY, and pure and active VIRTUE; with the prai&s;e-worthy de&s;ign of recalling to our remembrance the mo&s;t intere&s;ting truths in the mid&s;t of the mo&s;t &s;ociable

&amp; of promoting, without o&s;tentation, or hope of reward, the mo&s;t diffu&s;ive BENEVOLENCE, the mo&s;t generous and exten&s;ive PHILANTHROPY, and the mo&s;t warm and affec|tionate BROTHERLY LOVE. The members are united together by particular obligations, and ac|quainted by certain <HI>&s;igns</HI> and <HI>tokens</HI> pre&s;erved with inviolable &s;ecrecy from remote&s;t ages. The&s;e were originally adopted in order to di&s;tingui&s;h one another with ea&s;e and certainty from the re&s;t of the world; that impo&s;ters might not intrude upon their confidence and brotherly affection, nor intercept the fruits of their beneficence. They become <HI>an univer&s;al linguage,</HI> by which a brother in di&s;tre&s;s in a foreign country may make his &s;elf under&s;tood to &s;uch of the Society there as could relieve and protect him. The <HI>decora|tions</HI> and <HI>&s;ymbols</HI> of the Craft which are tho&s;e of a very common and u&s;eful art,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">ARCHITECTURE.</NOTE> and their <HI>pra&s;e-ology,</HI> which is borrowed from its higher orders, &s;erve to characterize an in&s;titution which might ju&s;tly claim more noble devices; and at the &s;ame time are u&s;ed either as emblems or indications of the &s;imple&s;t and mo&s;t important MORAL TRUTHS.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="032229_0024_0FF19C2BA0C98E00">
IT collects men of all nations and opinions into one amiable and permanent a&s;&s;ociation, and binds them by new and irrefragable obligations to the di&s;charge of every relative and moral duty: and thus becomes the mo&s;t effectual &s;upport and brighte&s;t ornament of &s;ocial life, and opens a wi|der channel for the current of benevolent affec|tions, and a new &s;ource to human happine&s;s.</P>
<P>ITS laws are REASON, EQUITY; its <HI>principles,</HI> BENEVOLENCE, LOVE; and its <HI>religion,</HI> PURITY and TRUTH. Its <HI>intention</HI> is PEACE ON EARTH; and its <HI>di&s;po&s;ition,</HI> GOOD WILL TOWARDS MEN.</P>
<P>"I THINK (&s;ays a fine writer<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rev. DR. MILNE, Grand Chaplain, in a &s;ermon be|fore the Grand Lodge of England, 1788.</NOTE>) we are war|ranted in concluding that a Society thus con&s;ti|tuted, and which may be rendered &s;o admirable an engine of improvement, far from meriting any reproachful or contumelious treatment, de|&s;erves highly of the community; and that the ridicule and affected contempt which it has &s;ome|times experienced can proceed only from ignor|ance or from arrogance; from tho&s;e; in &s;ine, who&s;e oppo&s;ition does it honor, who&s;e cen&s;ure is panegyric, and prai&s;e would be cen&s;ure."</P>
<P>ASSUREDLY then, my hearers, you will with

<P>RIGHT WORSHIPFUL MASTER, WOR|SHIPFUL WARDENS, RESPECTED OF|FICERS, AND BELOVED BRETHREN.</P>
<P>ACCEPT my affectionate &s;alutations&mdash;accept the felicitations of all the friends of Ma&s;onry. We are plea&s;ed with your harmony and zeal, and rejoice in your e&s;tabli&s;hment and pro&s;perity. Your &s;ucce&s;s is connected with the be&s;t intere&s;ts of humanity.! May the &s;ocial virtues you culti|vate and the heart-felt plea&s;ures you experience in the lodge, be your companions through life!

<P>LET <HI>all my brethren pre&s;ent</HI> be willing that I &s;hould remind them that in vain do we attempt the vindication of our mo&s;t excellent Society, or the commendatory de&s;cription of its purpo&s;es and requirements, if our conduct contradict our profe&s;&s;ion. Let us then be cautious to avoid all tho&s;e improprieties and vices which might tarni&s;h

"For &s;o is the will of GOD that with well doing ye may put to &s;ilence the ignorance of fooli&s;h men."</P>
<P>REMEMBER that we are THE ASSOCIATED FRIENDS OF HUMANITY; that our &s;acred union embraces in its philanthrophy amities of the Go&s;|pel; and that charity in its kinde&s;t exerci&s;e and large&s;t extent is our di&s;tingui&s;hing characteri&s;tic. Others wear the warmth of &s;ummer in their face, and the coldne&s;s of winter in their heart; but a Ma&s;on's <HI>di&s;po&s;ition</HI> &s;hould be mild as the breeze, open as the air, and genial as the &s;un&mdash;cheering and ble&s;&s;ing all around him: and his <HI>deeds</HI> plea&s;|ant as the clear &s;hining after the rain; and re|fre&s;hing, as the dewy cloud in a harve&s;t day.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I&s;ai.

<P>MAY <HI>the A&s;&s;embly at large</HI> be convinced that prejudicies again&s;t FREE MASONRY are ill found|ed,

<P>FINALLY; let us all pray that the priveleges of equal right may be widely extended, and all men become <HI>free:</HI> that wars and contentions may be forever terminated: that peace and happine&s;s may be the uninterrupted enjoyment of all mankind: and to GOD a&s;cend the univer&s;al; united; uncea|&s;ing a&s;cription of love and joy and prai&s;e!</P>
