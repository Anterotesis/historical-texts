<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>AT a time like the pre&s;ent, when the Liberties of the People are in danger; when the executive and legi&s;lative powers have united to denounce the POPULAR SOCIETIES; and when there is great rea&s;on to fear that the &s;upine&s;s of the friends of Liberty will enable its enemies to accompli&s;h its de&s;truction; it behoves every lover of his country, every advocate for the equal rights of man, to awake from the dream of delu&s;ive &s;ecurity, and exert every energy of his nature, to enlighten and pre&s;erve his fellow-citizens.</P>
<P>The DEMOCRATIC SOCIETIES have been &s;tigmatized with the opprobrious epithets of Anarchi&s;ts and Di&s;organizers; they have been loudly rated as wanting in political knowledge, and de&s;titute of integrity; and the public has been earne&s;tly called upon, not to con&s;ider them with the eye of friendline&s;s and ap|probation, but with the determined frown of indignation and contempt.</P>
<P>An enquiry naturally ari&s;es here&mdash;What have the&s;e people done? Wherefore are we required to &s;u&s;pect or dete&s;t them? It would be out of place, were I here to enter into a formal ju&s;ti|fication of their principles and conduct; neither do I de&s;ign it. It mu&s;t be left to time, and to the unbia&s;&s;ed judgment of future generations, to determine candidly on this great que&s;tion.</P>
<P>But whether the Democratic Societies have, or have not, been &s;ucce&s;sful in the demon&s;tration; there can be no doubt, in the mind of every intelligent ob&s;erver of the condition of our coun|try, that a dangerous Coalition exi&s;ts (<HI>actively,</HI> if not <HI>formally</HI>) to de&s;troy the general influence of the people; or, at lea&s;t, &s;o to modify it, as may be mo&s;t advantageous to the per&s;onal aggrand|i&s;ement of the Coalition.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e who are be&s;t acquainted with the hi&s;tory of the&s;e States, as well while under the authority and controul of Great Britain, as &s;ince the acknowledgement of their independence, have not failed to ob&s;erve that this &s;pirit of Ari&s;tocracy has manife&s;ted it&s;elf in various ways, and under very various forms, at different times.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="028171_0003_0FD73525B22F7D08">
The de&s;ign of the Briti&s;h Mini&s;try, beyond di&s;pute, was to e&s;ta|bli&s;h the political and religious &s;upremacy of their country over ours. A plan was undoubtedly in agitation to &s;addle us with an hereditary nobility; and a &s;ufficient number of <HI>right reverend</HI> bigots was to be di&s;tributed among us, who might wield the wea|pons of opinion in &s;upport of that power which gave them being, and maintained them in the enjoyment of its advantages. The revolution di&s;concerted the&s;e mea&s;ures. But though, for awhile, it prevented any attempts to carry them into execution, it did not de&s;troy that &s;ecret longing which had been excited by the arti|fices of the vile in&s;truments of the mother country.</P>
<P>It might be <HI>dangerous,</HI> and it certainly would be <HI>imprudent,</HI> to develope the &s;ecrets of all &s;ucceeding attempts. The&s;e, for|tunately for America, have hitherto failed of &s;ucce&s;s. GOD grant that all future &s;imilar de&s;igns may be equally ineffectual! The &s;ure&s;t means of cau&s;ing them to be &s;o, is, early to alarm the public mind concerning all men and all motions which appear to aim at the e&s;tabli&s;hment of an undue influence in the hands of any particular de&s;cription of citizens; and (the Honourable Legi&s;lator will pardon me if I mi&s;apply his words) <Q>gibbet them to public dete&s;tation.</Q> This is the more nece&s;&s;ary, as it is impo&s;&s;ible to determine to what exce&s;&s;es even that a&s;&s;umption of power, which is apparently mo&s;t innocent, may lead tho&s;e who exerci&s;e it: and, as there is rea&s;on to fear, there are tho&s;e in exalted &s;tations who would gladly &s;ing "the ditty of Republicani&s;m," in deri&s;ion, at the funeral of LIBERTY.</P>
<P>My enquiries have led me to examine, with more than com|mon attention, the &s;ubject of <HI>Policy,</HI> e&s;pecially the policy of the United States: and this, becau&s;e it appears evident to me, that, hitherto, our government is only a government of expedients; and that the <HI>great principle,</HI> by which the complicated affairs of this va&s;t continent are to be directed, is not yet di&s;covered. To this end, the mo&s;t exact &s;crutiny has been made into the hi&s;tory, manners, circum&s;tances, &amp;c. of this country; and, above all, into the characters and &s;ituations of tho&s;e per&s;ons who have at different periods taken the lead in civil, &s;ocial, military, and political life, throughout the &s;everal States. It was in the cour&s;e of this &s;cru|tiny that the following POEM (the fir&s;t Book of which is now given to the public) fell into my hands.</P>
<P>The Author of this work was, as acknowledged therein, con|cerned in one of tho&s;e plots again&s;t the liberties of the people, of which I have taken notice; and, I have good rea&s;on to believe,
<PB N="v" REF="028171_0004_0FD73525B56962B8">more deeply implicated in it than he a&s;&s;umes to be in the Poem. At any rate, he was the confidential friend of the man mo&s;t active in its promotion. To the furtherance of this &s;cheme, not Ameri|cans only, but Foreigners al&s;o, were a&s;&s;ociated; and all their projects were dear being carried into effect, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a number of Foreign Envoys&mdash;<HI>three, in particular</HI>&mdash;though but one (probably for poetical rea&s;ons) is taken notice of in the Poem. The cau&s;es of their failure are exhibited at large in the work it&s;elf.</P>
<P>The Author &s;ubmitted in &s;ilence to the demolition of his hopes; and &s;olaced him&s;elf by compo&s;ing this Poem at his country-&s;eat, whither he had retired, and where he died a few years &s;ince,&mdash;with the reputation of a great Patriot! The manu&s;cript, which probably was never intended for publication, at length pa&s;&s;ed into my hands. Hitherto I have kept it (even from the knowledge of my mo&s;t intimate friends), together with copies in his own hand|writing of a few of the Author's original letters, as a precious evidence of the factious de&s;igns of certain a&s;piring characters in our country; and nothing but our pre&s;ent alarming &s;ituation could have induced me to make it public, while &s;o many of the per&s;on|ages commemorated in it are yet alive. But the lu&s;t of power, when once excited, however it may be repre&s;&s;ed for a time, can never be extingui&s;hed but with life. And when I &s;ee the &s;ame &s;pirit, which has been &s;o often &s;ubdued, again &s;tarting into action&mdash;and my countrymen again likely to become its victims&mdash;I &s;hould be wanting in that patrioti&s;m by which I profe&s;s ever to be guided, were I to be deterred by fear of <HI>any man,</HI> however exalted in &s;tation, from making every po&s;&s;ible exertion in their behalf.</P>
<P>The publication of this Poem, at this time, appeared to me to promi&s;e &s;ome advantage to the general cau&s;e of Liberty. It may awaken &s;ome attention to our pre&s;ent condition; and, by &s;hewing (even under the gui&s;e of intere&s;ted prai&s;e) the means which <HI>have been</HI> u&s;ed to acquire undue con&s;ideration and power, teach my fel|low-citizens to look warily about them, and &s;ee whether like de|&s;igns are not now forming, and whether they ought not to be on their guard. It may &s;erve to <Q>counteract certain <HI>political here|&s;ies,</HI></Q>&mdash;I repeat it again, <Q><HI>certain political here&s;ies</HI>&mdash;which have &s;prung up among us.</Q> And it may excite them to a re|collection, that ARISTOCRACY has ever impo&s;ed it&s;elf upon the necks of all former Republics, till, by its increa&s;ing weight, it has &s;unk them in &s;lavery; and rou&s;e into action that energy of Freemen, always &s;uperior to the force of Oppre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="028171_0005_0FD7352A3AC2F800">
In re&s;pect to the literary merit of the Poem, it is probable the opinions of men will differ, as their own prejudices and wi&s;hes are expo&s;ed or flattered. I &s;hall attempt no vindication of it in a critical point of view. But I ought to exculpate the Author from one charge, to which he may, in the opinions of tho&s;e who do not read attentively, have expo&s;ed him&s;elf: I mean that of <HI>&s;elf-vilifi|cation.</HI></P>
<P>It is ob&s;ervable that the writer every where repre&s;ents him&s;elf and his friends as influenced &s;olely by <HI>&s;elf-intere&s;t:</HI> and it may &s;eem improbable that &s;uch a confe&s;&s;ion &s;hould proceed from any one who was really &s;o influenced. The following extract of a letter, by the &s;ame hand, will determine the Author's own opi|nion on this que&s;tion. The letter is written to the friend here celebrated under the name of ARISTUS, and bears date November, 1786.</P>
<P><Q>Let others think as they plea&s;e: we, who have &s;uch ample experience, have long &s;ince di&s;credited the dream of di&s;inter|e&s;ted benevolence. Surely no di&s;pute can be more ridiculous than tho&s;e which have ari&s;en on this &s;ubject, unle&s;s it &s;hould be tho&s;e re&s;pecting the propriety of employing (what are called) iniquitous means to obtain a good end. Opinions of this &s;ort are well enough to amu&s;e the vulgar; and to be played off on tho&s;e weak, but well-de&s;igning men, who mu&s;t have Scripture for every thing they do.</Q> And, in another letter to the &s;ame per&s;on, he &s;ays&mdash;<Q>In the pro&s;ecution of this de&s;ign, I have no doubt of your inflexible adherence to that maxim which has &s;o long been the governing rule of our actions, <HI>That if the</HI> END <HI>is de&s;irable, we are not to hold que&s;tion re&s;pecting the</HI> MEANS. Our motto &s;hould be RESPICE FINEM, but not in the &s;en&s;e of the Philo&s;opher.</Q></P>
<P>A more &s;erious objection &s;eems to lie again&s;t the machinery of the Poet. Nor do I know of any ju&s;tification of it, other than by &s;uppo&s;ing it a mere play of the fancy: for it could not be meant by him to in&s;inuate that the de&s;igns of his friend were infernal; and it is certain that the Author regarded Heaven and Hell, Pro|vidence and Futurity, equally fabulous as the theology of the Greeks or Hindoos, and alike the property of every dealer in rhyme&mdash;to be the elegant decorations of the Epopea, or the pon|derous ornaments of the Sonnet.</P>
<P>Here, then, the Editor takes his leave, for the pre&s;ent, of the reader; a&s;&s;uring him, that, if this Fir&s;t Book of 'ARISTOCRACY'
<PB N="vii" REF="028171_0006_0FD7352C182EA4B0">&s;hall be e&s;teemed of value, the remaining ones &s;hall be pre&s;ented to him with all convenient expedition. The Editor, indeed, de|&s;igned at fir&s;t to have publi&s;hed the entire work: but was de|terred from &s;o doing, by a fear le&s;t its &s;ize would prevent that general circulation which might be &s;ecured by a le&s;s immediately expen&s;ive mode of publication.</P>

This, the Editor tru&s;ts, is &s;ufficiently appa|rent from his Preface. Such exclamations of admiration as the author forces from us by the charms of his ver&s;e, may be pa&s;&s;ed over, without their being looked upon as any way implicating us in the villainy of the friends of ARISTUS And here it becomes us to give the author all due credit for the &s;ublime u&s;e he has made of machinery &s;o common as that of the infernal regions. But while the editor beholds it with wonder, he confe&s;&s;es his inability to explain the difficulty, which is apparent, in endeavouring to account for its particular application in this Poem, and by a pro|fe&s;&s;ed friend of the heroes celebrated. Perhaps the reader will think &s;ome light is thrown upon this dark &s;ubject in the &s;ucceed|ing Books.</NOTE></L>
