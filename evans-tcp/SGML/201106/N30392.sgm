<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Shewing what <HI>True Godline&s;s</HI> is, as al&s;o his Pedigree, Original, and Antiquity.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>_TRUE GODLINESS being of late (as well as in former Days) become &s;o great a Stranger to mo&s;t Men, and indeed known but by a very few in the World; I &s;hall in the fir&s;t place before I treat of his <HI>Travels</HI> and of the <HI>Entertainment</HI> he meets with where he comes, give you a de&s;cription of him, and the rather becau&s;e many Per&s;ons I perce<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ive, are &s;ubject to &s;o great an Error, as to take

This being &s;o, I conclude nothing is more nece&s;&s;ary, than to take off that ugly Ma&s;s or Vizard, which his implacable Enemies have put upon him, and clear him of all tho&s;e foul and unju&s;t &s;landers, and cur&s;ed reproaches of the Sons of <HI>Belial;</HI> that &s;o he may appear in his original, primitive and &s;potle&s;s innocency, that none may be afraid of him, or be unwilling to entertain him, nor a&s;hamed to own him, and make him their Bo&s;om-Companion.</P>
<P>Know ye therefore in the fir&s;t place,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Godline&s;s de&s;cribed.</NOTE> that <HI>Godline&s;s</HI> con&s;i&s;ts in the true and right knowledge of divine truths, or fundamen|tal principles of the Go&s;pel; which all Men ought to know and be e&s;tabli&s;hed in, that would be &s;aved, <HI>Without controver&s;y great is the my&s;tery of Godline&s;s: God was manife&s;t in the fle&s;h, ju&s;tified in the &s;pirit, &s;een of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, re|ceived up to Glory.</HI> 1 Tim. 3.16. The&s;e great truths of the Chri&s;tian Religion are called GODLINESS; many Men conclude 'tis no matter what principles they hold and cleave to, provided they do but live a &s;ober and hone&s;t Life, <HI>doing to all Men as they would be done into,</HI> &s;uppo&s;ing that the whole of Religion and Godline&s;s con&s;i&s;ts in the&s;e things; but alas they are greatly mi&s;taken; Godline&s;s is another kind of thing than they imagine; it is impo&s;&s;ible
<PB N="3" REF="040363_0004_10163E955D546858">to receive or entertain <HI>True Godline&s;s,</HI> whil&s;t we &s;hut out of Doors the e&s;&s;entials of the Chri&s;tian Religion; and in&s;tead thereof embrace Super&s;tition, Error, and Here&s;y; there being damning Principles as well a damning Practices, 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1.2, 3.</P>
<P>Now &s;hould any demand further, to hear more particu|larly what tho&s;e Principles of divine Truths, or fundamen|tals of the Chri&s;tian Faith be, which are the e&s;&s;entials of <HI>True Godline&s;s.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. I An&s;wer, That there is one eternal, infinite, mo&s;t holy, mo&s;t wi&s;e, ju&s;t, good and gracious GOD, or glori|ous Deity, &s;ub&s;i&s;ting in three di&s;tinct Per&s;ons, the <HI>Father,</HI> the <HI>Son,</HI> and the <HI>Holy Gho&s;t;</HI> and the&s;e are one, <HI>i. e.</HI> one in E&s;&s;ence.</P>
<P N="2">2. That this GOD, out of his great Love and Goodne&s;s, hath be&s;towed upon, and given to his People, one &s;ure, certain and infallible Rule of Faith and Practice, <HI>viz.</HI> The <HI>Holy Scriptures,</HI> by which they may know, not only, that there is a GOD and Creator, but of the Manner of the Creation of the World, and of all Things in Heaven and Earth, in Six Days: Together of his De&s;ign, End, and Purpo&s;e, or Rea&s;on, or Cau&s;e whereof he made all Things; and al&s;o to &s;hew them how Sin came into the World, and what Righteou&s;ne&s;s it is which GOD's holy Nature re|quires, to their Ju&s;tification or Di&s;charge from the Guilt of all Sin, <HI>&amp;c. viz.</HI> By a Redeemer, his own Son, whom he &s;ent into the World; and that there is no other Rule or Way to know the&s;e things, &s;o as for Men to be &s;aved but by Revelation, or the &s;acred Records of the holy Scrip|tures only.</P>
<P>And that the My&s;tery of Salvation lies above humane Rea&s;on, and cannot be known by the Light-in all Men.</P>
<P N="3">3. That our Redeemer the LORD JESUS CHRIST, who is &s;ub&s;tituted the Surety of the new Covenant, and
<PB N="4" REF="040363_0005_10163E970F1A5928">only Mediator betwixt GOD and Man, is truly GOD, of the E&s;&s;ence of the Father, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ly Man of the Sub&s;tance of the ble&s;&s;ed Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> con&s;i&s;ting of the&s;e two Na|tures in one Per&s;on: And that Redemption, Peace and Reconciliation is by this LORD JESUS CHRIST alone.</P>
<P N="4">4. That Ju&s;tification and Pardon of Sin is alone by that full Satisfaction the LORD JESUS CHRIST made to GOD's Ju&s;tice; and that his perfect Obedience (in doing what the Law required, and in his Suffering what we for our Sins de&s;erved) is imputed as that compleat Righteou&s;ne&s;s to all that believe in him; which Righteou&s;ne&s;s is appre|hended by Faith alone, thro' the holy Spirit, by which a Sinner is fir&s;t apprehended by Chri&s;t, before he can appre|hend and receive him.</P>
<P N="5">5. That all Men mu&s;t be Renewed, Regenerated, and Sanctified by the holy Spirit, which are, or can be &s;aved.</P>
<P N="6">6. That there will be a Re&s;urrection of the Bodies of all Men at the la&s;t Day, both of the ju&s;t and unju&s;t.</P>
<P N="7">7. That there will be an eternal Judgment, or that all &s;hall be brought to the Tribunal of JESUS CHRIST in the Great Day, and give an Account for all Things done in the Body; and that there will be a future State of Glory and eternal Happine&s;s of all true Believers, and of eternal Torment and Mi&s;ery of all unbelievers, and ungodly Per&s;ons, who live and die in their Sins.</P>
<P>Now, I &s;ay, in the true Knowledge and Belief of the&s;e Principles (which comprehend the Sub&s;tance of all the Fundamentals of true Religion, or the Chri&s;tian Faith) does <HI>True Godline&s;s</HI> con&s;i&s;t, as to his e&s;&s;ential Part.</P>
<P>So that who&s;oever have not received, and do not &s;ted|fa&s;tly believe his holy Doctrine, they have not received <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"></P>

<HI>Secondly,</HI> Godline&s;s, as to his inward and more hidden Parts and Power, is a holy Conformity to the &s;acred and divine Principles, which natural Men under&s;tand not: <HI>True Godline&s;s</HI> con&s;i&s;ts in the Light of &s;upernatural Truths and Life of Grace, God manife&s;ting him&s;elf in the Light of tho&s;e glorious Principles, and working the Life of &s;uper|natural Grace in the Soul by the Holy Gho&s;t: It con&s;i&s;ts in the &s;aving and experimental knowledge of God and Je&s;us Chri&s;t, in having all the evil Qualities of the Soul removed, and heavenly habits infu&s;ed in their Room, or in a gracious Conformity, Di&s;po&s;ition and Affection of the Heart to God, cleaving to all Truths made known to us, finding the powerful Influences of the Go&s;pel and Spirit of Chri&s;t upon us, whereby our Souls are brought into the Image and Likene&s;s of his Death and Re&s;urrection: This is <HI>True Godline&s;s,</HI> 'tis not a bare living up to the natural Principles of Morality, nor a &s;imple Knowledge of the Letter of the Word, or an hi&s;torical, notional, or dogma|tical Knowledge of the &s;acred Go&s;pel, and the Precepts thereof, but in a faithful living up to the &s;upernatural Principles of Grace, and the Go&s;pel, di&s;charging our Du|ties with as much Readine&s;s and Faithfulne&s;s toward God, as towards Man, &s;o that our Con&s;cience may be kept void of Offence towards both, <HI>Acts</HI> 24.16. It con&s;i&s;ts in for|&s;aking of every Sin, and not only to leave it, but to loath it as the greate&s;t Evil, and to cleave to God in Sincerity of Heart, valuing him above all who is the chiefe&s;t Good, and from a Principle of divine Love, willingly &s;ubjecting to all his Laws and Appointments. <HI>Godline&s;s</HI> makes a Man &s;ay with the P&s;almi&s;t.

<PB N="6" REF="040363_0006_10163E99912BFF00">as for the Wages of Religion: Some there be, who &s;erve God, that they may &s;erve them&s;elves upon God; but a true Chri&s;tian de&s;ires Grace, not only that God would glorify him in Heaven, but that he may glorify God on Earth: He crys, <HI>Lord, rather let me have a good Heart than a great E&s;tate;</HI> though he loves many Things be|&s;ides God, yet he loves nothing above God. This Man fears Sin more than Suffering, and therefore he will &s;uffer rather than &s;in: He is like a Palm-tree, he always flouri&s;hes be&s;t when he is pre&s;s'd down mo&s;t.

And what is this le&s;s than the putting a Lie upon him; be&s;ides it reflects upon the Wi&s;dom of God to attempt to change or alter any thing of the form of <HI>Godline&s;s,</HI> as if he did not know be&s;t how, and in what Way, or after what Manner he him&s;elf would be Wor&s;hiped. But mu&s;t be beholding to Man for his Help, Wi&s;dom, and rare Con|trivance, touching many Things that are by the Papi&s;ts called decent and nece&s;&s;ary; al&s;o it doth reflect upon the Care and Faithfulne&s;s of God, in&s;omuch, that he &s;hould not him&s;elf take Care to lay down in his ble&s;&s;ed Word many Things which are very nece&s;&s;ary to be added to the Form of <HI>Godline&s;s,</HI> which Man's Care and Wi&s;dom is fain to &s;upply.</P>

<P>THE great and mighty JEHOVAH, the God and Father of true Grace and Godline&s;s, out of his great Mercy and infinite Goodne&s;s to Mankind, graciou&s;ly was plea&s;ed to &s;end them a Saviour; yea, a great and mighty Saviour, or one <HI>able to &s;ave to the uttermo&s;t all that come to God by him,</HI> Heb. 7.25. And to the end, that they might have the Knowledge of this ble&s;&s;ed Saviour, he hath &s;ent the Go&s;pel among&s;t them, but in his eternal Wi&s;dom hath &s;o Decreed and Ordained it, that no Man &s;hould have any &s;aving Benefit by this glorious Saviour, but he who doth Receive, Entertain, and kindly Embrace True Godline&s;s when&s;oever he is &s;ent to Vi&s;it them; and to the end there|fore, that they might not mi&s;s of &s;o great a Ble&s;&s;ing which Godline&s;s brings along with him: I may &s;afely adventure to &s;ay, according to my pre&s;ent Method, and to pur&s;ue my Allegorical Di&s;cour&s;e; Godline&s;s hath received Com|mi&s;&s;ion from the King of Heaven and Earth to Travel, to &s;ee who would Embrace and Entertain him. More|over, it appears his Commi&s;&s;ion was very large, he was not limited to the &s;mall confines of <HI>Jury,</HI> nor to Travel only in the Land of <HI>Canaan,</HI> but to go into all the World, or to Travel into all Nations, Countries and Kingdoms of

But &s;ince I perceive he is come to a certain Town, where one <HI>Riches</HI> dwells, and is now at his Door, let us &s;ee what Entertainment he meets with at this Place.</P>
<P>Now <HI>Godline&s;s</HI> knock'd very hard and often before any within would give an An&s;wer,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Godline&s;s knocks at Riches door.</NOTE> <HI>Riches</HI> being full of Bu&s;ine&s;s; for either he was telling of his Money, or ca&s;ting up his Accompts, to &s;ee what his Neighbours ow'd him, or el&s;e con&s;ulting new Projects to encrea&s;e his Store, for I perceive he is a Per&s;on never &s;atisfied; be&s;ides, the Times being very perilous, his Mind was filled with per|plexing and vexatious Thoughts, how to &s;ave and keep what he had already gotten; &s;o that he had no Lei&s;ure nor Time to li&s;ten to the continual knocking of True Godline&s;s at his Door, in&s;omuch that Godline&s;s was forced to &s;tay there a long Time, and that which griev'd this high-born Prince mo&s;t of all, was this, <HI>(viz.)</HI> be per|ceiv'd that no &s;ooner than &s;ome other Gue&s;ts came to his Door, (who were Per&s;ons much inferior, as to Birth and Quality, to him, and indeed not worthy of the lea&s;t Re|gard, and not having Bu&s;ine&s;s of that great Weight and Moment with him as Godline&s;s had) yet he opened his Door immediately to them; but before this renowned Hero and darling of Heaven could get in, <HI>Riches</HI> had &s;o many ba&s;e and ill-bred &s;ervants in his hou&s;e, that they
<PB N="18" REF="040363_0012_10163EA3549A9CC8">clapp'd too the Door, &s;o that he could not get &s;o much as one Foot in.

<SPEAKER>Riches</SPEAKER>
<P>having thanked them for their good Coun&s;el, with a great deal of Joy, retires him&s;elf, being very well &s;atisfied with the Advice Dr. <HI>Self-love</HI> &amp; Sir <HI>Worldly Wi&s;dom</HI> had given him. And indeed, this is the mi&s;ery of mo&s;t Rich Men <HI>(viz)</HI> if they lie under any Conviction of Sin, from that little light Con&s;cience hath at any time got, then pre&s;ently (being &s;tirred up thereto by Covetou&s;ne&s;s;) they con&s;ult with Fle&s;h and Blood, and then Dr. <HI>Self-love</HI> and Sir <HI>Worldly Wi&s;dom</HI> are their great Coun&s;ellors.</P>
<P>But to proceed, <HI>Riches</HI> got now a Chaplain, and in&s;tead of opening to True Godline&s;s, he opens to Counterfeit Godline&s;s, which was occa&s;ioned thro' Ignorance, and tho&s;e other fooli&s;h Coun&s;ellors he hearkened to. Now, this Man, as it appears, proved a &s;ad Fellow, for though he was a Scholar, being brought up in &s;ome Univer&s;ity, yet he never cared to read the Bible, but as &s;ome &s;ay, would now and then cur&s;e it, love to read Romances and Song-Books. But poor Con&s;cience being &s;tifled, in a little time he gave Content to the whole Family, in that he could mumble over a few Prayers out of a Book: And that in the &s;econd place, he could Bowl, drink Healths, be Drunk, and cry Damn him with any of them; and there was indeed never a one in all the Family that hated True Godline&s;s more than he; for he made Songs of him, and Scoffed, Jeered
<PB N="28" REF="040363_0017_10163EB29EB534C0">and Derided him, continually calling him a My&s;terious and Non&s;en&s;ical Fellow, talking of Things again&s;t all hu|man Rea&s;on, and above all belief, of three that are but one; and he made him&s;elf and others Merry with his mean, low and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Condition, and al&s;o &s;tirr'd up all the Neigh|bourhood, to find Fault and Quarrel with all tho&s;e who were Friends and true Lovers of him.</P>
<P><HI>Godline&s;s</HI> now perceived he was like to have but cool Entertainment at his Hou&s;e, having waited at <HI>Riches</HI> Gate till his Patience was almo&s;t worn out, began to think of a Removal, and to Travel to &s;ome other Place; but before he took his final Farewel, he was re&s;olved to &s;peak his Mind freely to him, thereby to leave him without any kind of Excu&s;e what&s;oever, and therefore Addre&s;s'd him|&s;elf to him after this Manner, being at the Door ready to depart.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Godline&s;s.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, <HI>Riches,</HI> I &s;ee now very plainly, you did but flatter me when you began to hearken to your poor Steward Con&s;cience, in order to the letting me into your Hou&s;e; for evident it is, you are grown far wor&s;e than before, and have blinded his Eyes, by entertaining another, who calls him&s;elf by my Name in&s;tead of me; but before I do depart, I will &s;hew you the great danger you are in, and the Cau&s;e of it; the Truth is, you have got &s;uch a Crew of loo&s;e, ba&s;e and deceitful Servants, that they will utterly undo you, and bring upon you the eter|nal Ruin of your poor Soul, which I de&s;ign'd by my co|ming to you, to &s;ave and make happy for ever; for indeed (whether you believe it or no) there was never any who entertained the&s;e gracele&s;s Villains and Enemies of God, but were for ever ruin'd by them at la&s;t; nay, not only eternally hereafter in the World to come, but many times externally here in this World; therefore I advi&s;e you to do what you can to get rid of them, and I will help you
<PB N="29" REF="040363_0017_10163EB29EB534C0">to far better Servants in their &s;tead. For fir&s;t of all, can you think it will be &s;afe for you to keep <HI>Pre&s;umption</HI> &s;till in your Hou&s;e, &s;ince there is &s;carce a more deceitful and bloody Wretch in the World? How many thou&s;ands of poor Souls hath he impudently de&s;troy'd, by cau&s;ing them to pre&s;ume on the Mercy of God, and the death of Chri&s;t, and yet live in Sin, Pride, and Covetou&s;ne&s;s, and in a vile Manner hating and contemning me, that is to &s;ay, True Godline&s;s? Doth not God &s;ay, <HI>It is hard for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of heaven,</HI> and yet you are per&s;waded by him, to think it is an ea&s;y thing? And doth not the Scriptures &s;ay, <HI>Except your righteou&s;ne&s;s do exceed the righ|teou&s;ne&s;s of the Scribes and Phari&s;ees, ye &s;hall in no wi&s;e enter into the kingdom of God?</HI> Mat. 5.20. And yet he tells you that by doing a few good Deeds, or by giving a little of your great abundance to the Poor, your State is good enough; whereas many of the Phari&s;ees did as to acts of Charity, exceedingly out do you; nay, doth not St <HI>Paul</HI> &s;ay, <HI>though he gave all his goods to feed the poor, and his body to be burned, yet without Charity,</HI> (that is to &s;ay, true love to Godline&s;s) <HI>he was nothing,</HI> 1 Cor. 13.3. and yet you, tho' you flight and contemn God and Godline&s;s, are taught to pre&s;ume on God's Mercy, who hath notwith&s;tanding po&s;itively &s;aid concerning you, and &s;uch as you are; <HI>He that made them will not &s;ave them; and he that formed them, will &s;hew them no favour,</HI> I&s;a. 27.11.</P>
<P>As touching what <HI>Self-love</HI> &s;aith, it is abominable; do you not find the Lord Je&s;us &s;aying, <HI>that unle&s;s a man deny him&s;elf he cannot be my di&s;ciple,</HI> Mat. 16.22. Now this Fellow is one of the re&s;t there meant, even Self-love and Self-righteou&s;ne&s;s, as well as Sinful-&s;elf and Natural &s;elf. Sir, you mu&s;t get rid of them all, or peri&s;h for ever.</P>
<P>Will you love your &s;elf more than Chri&s;t? Self-love mu&s;t die, he is a Traitor to the Lord of Life and Glory;
<PB N="30" REF="040363_0018_10163EB5B4410B70">and an utter Enemy to your own Soul; if you make him your Coun&s;ellor, you are an undone Man.</P>
<P>And then as to Worldly Wi&s;dom, he is the Devil's Attorney-General, that ever gives Coun&s;el to all that hearken to him again&s;t God and Chri&s;t, and all revealed Religion; this is he that Satan hath &s;tirred up (&s;ince Liber|ty of Con&s;cience hath been e&s;tabli&s;hed, and Popery hath been vanqui&s;hed) to deceive and ruin the Souls of Men; 'tis he that ridicules all &s;upernatural di&s;coveries of God, or revealed Religion, and would indeed rob the whole Kingdom of the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, and &s;o Paganize this I&s;le again. Doth not <HI>Paul</HI> &s;ay, <HI>the world by wi&s;dom knew not God?</HI> He would have you believe nothing to be a Truth or Principle of Religion that lies above your own humane Rea&s;on; and therefore he &s;ays there is nothing my&s;terious in Chri&s;tianity; by which he gives the Scrip|ture the Lie, that &s;ays <HI>without controver&s;y great is the my&s;tery of Godline&s;s,</HI> 1 Tim. 3.16.</P>
<P>He will not &s;uffer &s;uch that hearken to him, to believe the Trinity of Per&s;ons in the &s;acred Godhead, nor that Chri&s;t is the mo&s;t high God, and yet very Man in one Per&s;on, becau&s;e it lies above Man's Wi&s;dom, or human Under&s;tanding to comprehend it; nor that &s;inners can be ju&s;tified by an imputed Righteou&s;ne&s;s, or by the active and pa&s;&s;ive obedience of Chri&s;t, tho' 'tis po&s;itively a&s;&s;erted to be thus, by the Spirit of God in the Word.</P>
<P>This Worldly Wi&s;dom and Sir Humane Rea&s;on taught the Greeks (in the Apo&s;tles time) to contemn the preach|ing of Chri&s;t crucified, and Salvation by him, as a fooli&s;h Notion, or idle Dream; and &s;o they &s;trive to per&s;wade People to think now, and &s;o to trample the chief Principles of the Chri&s;tian Faith under their Feet.</P>
<P>Alas! 'tis evident, that there are many earthly Things, or Things in Nature, which no Man can comprehend nor
<PB N="31" REF="040363_0018_10163EB5B4410B70">give Rea&s;on of; and is it any marvel then, that the My&s;teries of the Go&s;pel, or the deep things of God, are above Man's humane Rea&s;on to conceive of them, &s;o as to comprehend them?</P>
<P>Yet know, tho' the&s;e My&s;teries are above humane Rea&s;on, they are not again&s;t Rea&s;on to believe them: Is it not rea&s;onable that Men believe what the God of Truth affirms, and the eternal Father, Son and Spirit bear Record unto?

<P>Now <HI>Poverty</HI> had it &s;eems, divers ba&s;e and lazy Compa|nions, who were all grand Enemies to True Godline&s;s; al&s;o &s;ome of them 'tis &s;aid, were his own Children, or natural Off-&s;pring; there Names were the&s;e, <HI>(viz) Un|belief, Ignorance, Sloth</HI> alias <HI>Idlene&s;s, Wa&s;tful, Light fingers,

<P>Fir&s;t, <HI>Sloth</HI> and <HI>Idlene&s;s</HI> would not &s;uffer him to ri&s;e out of his Bed of Security to call upon God, nor take pains to pull up the Briars and Thorns that grew in his Heart; by which Means his Field lay barren and untill'd, nothing growing therein, but what the Ground brought forth naturally: Nay the&s;e made him of &s;uch a Sluggi&s;h Tem|per, and &s;uch a lover of Re&s;t, that he complained many times becau&s;e he could not go without Motion: Nay, he was unwilling to be at the Trouble of Feeding him&s;elf, and therefore would wi&s;h that Men might live as Trees and Plants do: I remember a very wi&s;e Man told me, <HI>that he hides his hand in his bo&s;om, and it grieveth him to bring it again to his mouth,</HI> Prov. 26.15. by the means of the&s;e two lazy Fellows, <HI>Sloth</HI> and <HI>Idlene&s;s.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ignorance</HI> told him he had received True Godline&s;s al|ready, and that he had dwelt in his Hou&s;e ever &s;ince he was a Child, and that Bapti&s;m brought him in; and that the chief Bu&s;ine&s;s which God required of him, was to get Bread and Cloaths for his Family.</P>
<P><HI>Unbelief</HI> told him, that tho&s;e Things which Godline&s;s talked of, were meer Fictions. But when he que&s;tion'd the Truth of what Unbelief &s;poke upon this account, then the Wretch told him, however they were Things far out of his reach, neither could they (if it was po&s;&s;ible to obtain them) an&s;wer his pre&s;ent Nece&s;&s;ities.</P>
<P><HI>Light-fingers</HI> told him he had been for a great while his be&s;t Friend, and if it had not been for him, he had been &s;tarved to Death long before now.</P>

<P><HI>Wa&s;teful</HI> told him, that True Godline&s;s, if entertained, would not &s;uffer him to buy &s;uch good pieces of Beef, Mutton, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as he was u&s;ed to do on tru&s;t, unle&s;s he knew he was able to pay for 'em; and that he would not &s;uffer him to go any more to merry Meetings, and carou&s;e it among&s;t good Fellows at the Ale-Hou&s;e, nor recreate him|&s;elf at Cards, Nine-Pins, and other Sports, for Money on Holidays, and that he mu&s;t be content with &s;uch mean Cloaths and Fare he had got, and never lo&s;e a Day's Work to gratify the Lu&s;ts of the Fle&s;h; and that al&s;o he mu&s;t change his Company; which particularly was grievous to Poverty to bear.</P>
<P><HI>Carping-cares</HI> filled his Head &s;o full of di&s;tracting Tho'ts, that he had not time to think of God, Chri&s;t, nor his own Soul, from one Week's end to another; but his great Study was either to think where to borrow Money, and &s;o get more in Debt, or el&s;e how to Pay what he ow'd, to get out of Debt, or what he &s;hould do for Work, Trade being grown (by the badne&s;s of the Times) very dead; by this Means he was filled with &s;ad Tho'ts, not knowing how he &s;hould get more Bread, when that he had was gone, and more Cloaths, when them he had, would hang on no longer; be&s;ides, it could not go out of his Mind, but that at one Time or other he &s;hould be Arre&s;ted, and thrown into a Gaol, having many Times mo&s;t fearfully broke his Word.</P>
<P><HI>Faint-heart</HI> and <HI>Fear-man</HI> pre&s;ented to him the Danger he would be in upon many con&s;iderations, if True Godli|ne&s;s were entertained:</P>
<P>For, fir&s;t, they told him how contemptible Real-God|line&s;s was grown at this pre&s;ent Time, being of very little e&s;teem among&s;t any degrees of Men in the World, by rea&s;on of <HI>Vice,</HI> which was never more rampant; in&s;omuch

<ARGUMENT>
<P>Shewing how <HI>True Godline&s;s</HI> finding <HI>Riches</HI> and <HI>Poverty</HI> had rejected him, in his Tra|vels, came to a great City, where dwelt a brave young Gallant, with whom he had a Mind to be acquainted, and to take up his Lodging; &s;hewing al&s;o how ba&s;ely he was dealt withal by him.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>ONE might think, by this Time, 'twas in vain for True Godline&s;s to travel any farther, not being like to find Entertainment any where, &s;ince Riches and Po|verty both had refu&s;ed to receive him; yet he was re&s;ol|ved to pur&s;ue his Journey, not being without Hopes of finding his dear Friend at la&s;t called <HI>Con&s;ideration,</HI> whom he &s;ought for; and coming into a famous City where one <HI>Youth</HI> dwelt, could not tell but he might meet with him at his Hou&s;e, calling to Mind what Kindne&s;s young <HI>Jo|&s;eph, Mo&s;es, Samuel, David, Obadiah, Jo&s;ias, John</HI> and <HI>Timothy</HI> of Old, and many others, had &s;hewed him, and therefore came boldly to his Door, and de&s;ired Enter|tainment. Now, it appears, this Young&s;ter was a great Gallant, but tho' he had been brought up to Learning,
<PB N="56" REF="040363_0031_1016662633E700A8">and lived in a Place where the Go&s;pel was powerfully preached, yet he was very ignorant as touching the be&s;t Things, tho' very complai&s;ant. And after Godline&s;s had in a grave and &s;ober Manner, de&s;ired a Lodging with him, and asked him what he was, as al&s;o his Name, he &s;pake thus:</P>
<SP>

<P>Sir, I am a Per&s;on of noble De&s;cent, being nearly allied to a great and mighty Prince, and my Name is <HI>True Godline&s;s,</HI> being by him &s;ent to travel hither, to commend his &s;overeign Grace and Clemency unto the Inhabtiants of this City; and I have al&s;o brought along with me, (as Tokens of his eternal Favour and Good-Will, to &s;uch who will receive me) very rich Pre&s;ents, and I &s;hall be&s;tow them on you, if you will be plea&s;ed to entertain me.</P>

<P>Alas, Father, you may not live another Day, Death may &s;eize you before to-Morrow Morning, <HI>Prov.</HI> 27.1. Why &s;hould you put me off? I was formerly at your Door, when you was young, and then you told me you could not open to me, becau&s;e you had not &s;owed

<HEAD>CHAP. VII.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Shewing how True Godline&s;s, in his fre&s;h and late Travels, came into a certain I&s;land, where he met with a great Number of cur&s;ed Ene|mies; &s;hewing the pre&s;ent State of the Church among us, and abroad in Neighbour|ing Nations the Year <HI>1688.</HI></P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>TRUE Godline&s;s having travelled up and down in the World for many Years, and &s;uffered divers Hard|&s;hips, and grand Affronts, at la&s;t came, by the gracious Providence of God into a &s;mall I&s;le, neither did he travel alone, but like a high-born Prince, (tho' in a &s;tate of exile for many Years pa&s;t) he had &s;ome Servants to attend and wait upon him, who loved him&punc; and his great Ma&s;ters as their own Souls, and above their natural Lives: their
<PB N="67" REF="040363_0036_1016669E6028E900">Names were <HI>True-faith, Heavenly new-man, Innocency, Humility, Sincerity, Temperance, Sobriety, Faithful, New-obedience, Hope-well, True-love, Ble&s;&s;ed-experience, Excel|lent-knowledge, Chri&s;tian-courage, Vehement-de&s;ire, Godly-zeal,</HI> &amp;c. with many more. Now, after he had been there, and was in great e&s;teem &amp; honour for divers years, yet about Forty Years ago, lo, on a &s;udden, a black Cloud came over him, and a new War was rai&s;ed upon him, and upon all his real Friends, Servants and Favourites, which God permitted, to fulfill an ancient Prophecy, for the Slaugh|ter of the two Witne&s;&s;es, <HI>Rev.</HI> 11. and &s;o if po&s;&s;ible, ut|terly &s;uppre&s;s, root out, and de&s;troy true Godline&s;s; and in order to the accompli&s;hing of this, there were let into the &s;aid I&s;le a multitude of out-landi&s;h Men, called <HI>Baby|lonians,</HI> being Natives of a great City, called by that Name; &s;o that the &s;aid I&s;land, by this means, was called <HI>Sodom</HI> and <HI>Egypt,</HI> where al&s;o our Lord was &s;piritually Crucified.</P>
<P>Now the&s;e Enemies had divers &s;trange and ridiculous Orders of Men among&s;t them, and all cruel Enemies to true Godline&s;s, but one Order proved more &s;uitable and implacable than all the re&s;t called (by &s;ome) Loyalties, being as 'tis &s;aid, the &s;purious Off &s;pring of one <HI>Ignatious Loyala,</HI> who where Men of &s;uch ba&s;e Spirits, that they were content to become meer Pimps and Panders to the great Whore, endeavouring all Ways to allure Kings, Princes and mighty Men to commit Fornication with her; and if they could not effect that, then they per&s;wade Subjects to ca&s;t off their Allegiance to their temporal So|vereigns, and to own the u&s;urp'd Power and Juri&s;diction of their great Ma&s;ter the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">The Pope.</NOTE> King of <HI>Babylon.</HI></P>
<P>Now, the&s;e Men remembring what a great Enemy true Godline&s;s had been to them in the &s;ame I&s;le former Times, and how he had forced them to pack up their
<PB N="68" REF="040363_0037_101666A0132FC228">Trumpery and begone: Nay, and not only &s;o, but al&s;o they found that he had got a great Number of the Inha|bitants of the &s;aid I&s;le to &s;ide with him, again&s;t their beloved Mi&s;tre&s;s and great Godde&s;s <HI>Diana,</HI> which they feared might &s;tand in the Way of her mounting the Saddle once again; they &s;ought out many Ways to root out and utterly de&s;troy true Godline&s;s, and this they did, by con|triving divers Plots and &s;ham Plots; the fir&s;t was in the Year 1661, when they craftily en&s;naring a Company o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> poor mi&s;s-led Men, called <HI>Fifth Monarchy Men,</HI> who tho't in their own Time, and by their own Strength, by outward force, to have erected true Godline&s;s a mo&s;t glo|rious vi&s;ible Kingdom; and by this Means the common Enemy took an Occa&s;ion to call all the Friends and Fa|vourites of true Godline&s;s, Traitors, and utter Enemies to Kings and civil Magi&s;tracy, which he and they ever ab|horr'd: But upon this a great Per&s;ecution was rai&s;ed and many of the chiefe&s;t Friends to true Godline&s;s were impri&s;oned, and &s;ome executed&punc; and divers died in filthy Pri&s;ons; but after this they rai&s;ed a wor&s;e Per&s;ecution, and another after that, and at la&s;t they maliciou&s;ly an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> traiterou&s;ly re&s;olved, by a Devili&s;h Con&s;piracy to de&s;troy true Godline&s;s, and all that favoured him, and to &s;et up fal&s;e and counterfeit Godline&s;s in his &s;tead; and indeed they &s;o far proceeded, that the friends of true Godline&s;s <HI>viz.</HI> the two Witne&s;&s;es of Je&s;us were brought under <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> civil Death, being dive&s;ted of all Power, Help, or Hope, and like dead Men were ca&s;t out by the Walls, yet God defeated their Con&s;piracy &s;o far as to di&s;cover the Con|&s;pirators, or el&s;e doubtle&s;s true Godline&s;s, and all his Fa|vourites had received the mo&s;t fatal Blow as ever was known; but God would not have the dead Bodies of his Witne&s;&s;es to be put into Graves, yet divers holy Per&s;ons were cut off by their bloody and traiterous Hands in the

<P>But lo! upon this mo&s;t joyful News arrived the Lyon of the North, whom God rai&s;ed up with a mighty Spirit, and with like Succe&s;s, to attempt the Deliverance of the whole I&s;le, and true Godline&s;s al&s;o; which tidings frighted the Babylonians and their Princes al&s;o, that on a &s;udden they all fled; and by this means (and by Virtue of a Law made in favour of true Godline&s;s) the Witne&s;&s;es of Chri&s;t were &s;et upon their Feet, and &s;tood on firmer Ground than perhaps they had done for a thou&s;and Years before, which cau&s;ed no &s;mall Joy to all that feared God, and were lovers of true Godline&s;s in the Land.</P>
<P>And now, one would think, the Sorrows, Troubles and Sufferings of true Godline&s;s were near ended, and joy fill'd the Hearts of all that loved him: But alas, alas, it appeared otherwi&s;e, for this glorious Deliverance and Revolution hath not had tho&s;e de&s;ired effects as might have been hoped, for altho' outward Peace and Pro&s;perity &s;eemed to favour the I&s;le, and true Godline&s;s al&s;o, yet there were (and &s;till continue) many Cau&s;es of great Sorrow and Grief to true Godline&s;s, and all godly Per&s;ons, &s;o that at this very Time, behold and &s;ee true Godline&s;s hath put on Mourning Gar|ments, and is in a whithering and declining Condition, and crys out, O it was better with me and my Children in Times pa&s;t when in Egypt, under Servitude and Bondage. The Cau&s;es of this Lamentation you will have an account of by and by.</P>

<ITEM>1. It ari&s;es from that gro&s;s ignorant Blindne&s;s and Super&s;tition, that &s;till covers great Part of the I&s;le.</ITEM>

<ITEM>3. From the Con&s;ideration of the Prevalency of almo&s;t all Manner of Here&s;ies and dete&s;table Errors.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. Particularly by rea&s;on of that great Corruption in, and about, one main Pillar that upholds True Godline&s;s, <HI>viz.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>That of Ju&s;tification, and Errors in this Sen&s;e hath crept in among&s;t &s;ome, who pretend great Love to him; but &s;tay, did I call this a main Pillar of True Godline&s;s? I mu&s;t &s;ay it is an e&s;&s;ential Part of which he doth con&s;i&s;t; &s;o that this one, and &s;ome other Errors, &s;eem to &s;trike at the very Life and Being of True Godline&s;s; &s;o that the free Grace of God, that fir&s;t &s;hone forth in the Beginning of the Reformation, &s;eems to be contemn'd, and a &s;ad Cloud hath &s;pread over this I&s;le; and Popery creeps in under a Di&s;gui&s;e; the internal Acts and inherent Righte|ou&s;ne&s;s of Man, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s join'd to or mixt with the perfect Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t, to ju&s;tify a Sinner before God; the Go&s;pel and free Promi&s;e is turned into a meer Law, and that we are no farther ju&s;tified than we are inherently &s;anctified. No, this is to &s;tab True Godline&s;s, as it were, at the very Heart, or it is to cut off a Limb of him.</P>
<P>And as the&s;e lay him a Bleeding on the one Hand, &s;o others expo&s;e him to Reproach and Shame on the other Hand; &s;ome affirm, that the Per&s;ons of the Elect were actually ju&s;tified from Eternity, even before they did per|&s;onally exi&s;t, and as much beloved with a Love of Com|placency, before they obtain a vital Union with Chri&s;t, yea, whil&s;t Swearers, Drunkards, Whoremongers, Thieves, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as when they are renewed, regenerated and &s;anctified Per&s;ons; and that the holy Spirit, that unites the Soul to Chri&s;t, makes only a real and not a relative Change, &s;o that Ju&s;tification by Faith, is only declarative to a Man's own Con&s;cience.</P>
<P>Now it is evident, that this is directly contrary to True Godline&s;s, and the Rule thereof, <HI>i. e.</HI> the Word of God,
<PB N="71" REF="040363_0038_101666A2CBD13520">that &s;ays, all Men fell in the fir&s;t <HI>Adam,</HI> by his Di&s;obe|dience, and are all alike naturally under Sin, Death, Wrath, and the Cur&s;e of the Law, or fir&s;t Covenant, <HI>Rom.</HI> 5.12. all being called <HI>Ungodly, Sinners, Enemies, Servant of Sin, dead in Sin and Tre&s;pa&s;&s;es, Children of Wrath, without God, Strangers from the Life of God, with|out Chri&s;t, under Condemnation, the Wrath of God abiding on them</HI> (and on all them) <HI>that believe not,</HI> John 3.36.</P>
<P>Can the&s;e Things be &s;aid of ju&s;tified and pardon'd Per|&s;ons? And is not Chri&s;t to be offered to Sinners, to un|godly Per&s;ons, to condemned Per&s;ons, as &s;uch? Or, are ju&s;tified and pardoned Men and Women without God, without Chri&s;t, condemn'd or ungodly, and unbelieving Per&s;ons? And becau&s;e the Elect were repre&s;entatively virtually ju&s;tified in the actual Ju&s;tification of Chri&s;t, when he was rai&s;ed from the dead, were they therefore then all per&s;onally and really ju&s;tified, even before they per&s;onally did exi&s;t? Such Notions as the&s;e are rai&s;ed and cried up, which ca&s;t Contempt upon True Godline&s;s.</P>
<P>Others al&s;o deny the <HI>Deity of Chri&s;t,</HI> and his Satisfac|tion, &s;eeking hereby utterly to eclip&s;e his Glory; and others deny his Humanity; &s;ome, who pretend to love True Godline&s;s, affirm he is not God of the E&s;&s;ence of his Father, nor Man of the Sub&s;tance of the ble&s;&s;ed Vir|gin, being wor&s;e Hereticks than the <HI>Arians:</HI> Others affirm, that the <HI>true Chri&s;t</HI> is nothing el&s;e but that inward Quality or Light that is in the Hearts of all Men; and the&s;e Hereticks (as one that is come off from them &s;ays) have deluded an hundred thou&s;and Souls in this I&s;le, who hardly hold one &s;ound Principle of true Chri&s;tianity.</P>
<P N="5">5. Another Cau&s;e is from that great Decay of the Power of Religion, and &s;trange Witherings, and Want of Love to one another, among&s;t them that pretend to be the chief Lovers of True Godline&s;s; together with tho&s;e
<PB N="72" REF="040363_0039_101666A7AD761F60">&s;ad Contentions, Strife and Divi&s;ions that are among them; for in&s;tead of loving, they do even &s;eem to hate and re|proach one another; and becau&s;e they are not all of one Judgment, in &s;ome le&s;&s;er Points of Religion, they are &s;trangely alienated from each other, in their Love and Affections.</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>La&s;tly,</HI> The di&s;orderly Walking of Church-Mem|bers, as in not keeping their Places in tho&s;e re&s;pective Congregations to which they belong, is no &s;mall Injury, Reproach and Scandal to True Godline&s;s: Members act as if they were under no Government, nor Covenant to God, one to another, and unto the Church, and go a&s;tray from the Fold, by which they ca&s;t Contempt upon the Mini&s;try where they are Members, and &s;eem to charge God with Cruelty to them, in bringing them into a Church where they cannot Profit; whereas the Cau&s;e may lie in them&s;elves, and by Rea&s;on of an evil Itch they have upon them; and by this Means God, no Lord's Day, hath a compleat Church Sacrifice or Oblation, but a Part, or but a few Per&s;ons; and that which adds to his Reproach, is that unaccountable Practice of one or two Congregations, in the great City, who countenance Rents and Schi&s;m, and contemn the Authority of other Churches, by an irregular Reception of their Members.</P>
<P>Now, from the Sen&s;e of the&s;e Things, True Godline&s;s broke forth into this bitter Lamentation here following.</P>
<P>Godline&s;s's <HI>Lamentation.</HI></P>
<P>HOW &s;hall I expre&s;s my Grief, or utter my Complaint? Oh, the Sorrow that &s;eizes on my Soul! I that am the noble Off-&s;pring of the univer&s;al Monarch, of the whole World, the true Favourite of Heaven, the true Intere&s;t of all Nations, Kingdoms and Common-Wealths;

<P>For,</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> I am charged with Here&s;y, an horrible Crime indeed, but 'tis no other than I was of old Times accu&s;ed with. But what is the Here&s;y?

<HI>Godli.</HI> It is enough, I always teach Men and Women, who embrace me, to be holy, peaceable, gentle and ea&s;y to be entreated, full of mercy, to hate hypocri&s;y, and all the deeds of the Fle&s;h. Therefore take notice, if any, who are called by my Name, or profe&s;s love to me, are unholy, quarrel&s;ome, given to &s;trife, debate and conten|tion, falling out with their Neighbours, making cau&s;ele&s;s Di&s;turbance in the Town, Place or Hou&s;e where they dwell, and Churches al&s;o, I do this Day di&s;own them; and indeed, 'tis they, who have in part expo&s;ed me to Reproach and Contempt in the&s;e eveil Days.</P>
<P>I am accu&s;ed al&s;o with Sedition and Faction, and for being the chief Ring-leader of Sects, &amp;c. But I may well &s;ay, with my old friend St. <HI>Paul,</HI> (who was accu&s;ed by <HI>Tertullian</HI> in like &s;ort) being called <HI>a pe&s;tilent fellow, a mover of &s;edition, &amp;c.</HI> Acts 24.5. I am clear from this evil Charge, neither can they prove this Accu&s;ation again&s;t me, I have been travelling up and down in mo&s;t parts of the Earth, for almo&s;t Six thou&s;and Years, and 'tis &s;trange, were I really guilty, that none &s;hould come forth and prove it again&s;t me. Therefore know ye, that the Doc|trine of true Godline&s;s, the Off-&s;pring of <HI>Jehovah,</HI> the darling of Heaven, do, and ever did teach upon this Account, is this, <HI>viz.</HI> That Hu&s;bands ought to love their Wives, Wives to obey their Hu&s;bands, Children to ho|nour their Parents, and Parents to carry it wi&s;ely towards their Children, and to bring them up in the fear and nur|ture of the Lord. Servants to obey their Ma&s;ters, and Ma&s;ters to carry it well towards their Servants; and Neigh|bours to live in love with one another. Church-members to love one another as their own Souls, and obey their Rulers; and Subjects to obey their Prince. Did I not ever teach this Doctrine, viz. <HI>That all men ought to be &s;ubject to principalities, to obey magi&s;trates, and to be ready to
<PB N="76" REF="040363_0041_101666AE910690F8">every good work?</HI> Tit. 3.1. And if Chri&s;tians, at any time, are, by their Superiours, required to do &s;uch things that they conceive are contrary to the Word and Will of God, then I bid them patiently to &s;uffer, and not to re&s;i&s;t, but to learn of my ble&s;&s;ed Ma&s;ter, who when he was re|viled, reviled not again, and when he &s;uffered, he threat|ned not.</P>
<P>But the&s;e Things are not the whole Cau&s;e of my Lamen|tation, but there are many other Rea&s;ons. For,</P>
<P>Alas, alas, what Ignorance, Blindne&s;s and Super&s;tition is in the Land; the I&s;le was once famous, and &s;pewed out tho&s;e nautious Abominations, which too many have lick'd up again: Some &s;ay there is no great difference be|tween the Service of great Babylon, and that which is in this I&s;le; and that which troubles me mo&s;t, is this, 'tis called by my Name, as if it appertained to my ancient Form, which is a great abu&s;e of me.</P>

<P>How is the glory of my great Prince eclip&s;ed, and the light of the Go&s;pel darkned? How is Light taken for Darkne&s;s, and Darkne&s;s for Light, Truth called Error, and Error called Truth.</P>
<P N="3">3. How doth Ungodline&s;s vaunt him&s;elf, and Prophane|ne&s;s ride Rampant? What multitudes &s;tand ready to re|ceive my Enemy Ungodline&s;s in all his travels, where&s;o|ever he comes? the mighty bow down unto him, and nobles kindly &s;alute him; both old &amp; young, rich &amp; poor adore and hug him in their Bo&s;oms, and make him their love and chiefe&s;t delight; no Laws of Nature, Nations, nor of Grace, will or can deter them; nor the hopes of

<P N="4">4. And O! how are my friends and deare&s;t favourites Oppre&s;&s;ed and Per&s;ecuted abroad? Alas, alas, how low is my Prince's Intere&s;t brought in <HI>France,</HI> in the Vallies of <HI>Piedmont,</HI> in the <HI>Palatinate</HI> and <HI>Saxony,</HI> and almo&s;t thro'-out all Nations of Europe?

<P>But in the mid&s;t of my Lamentation, the Thoughts of tho&s;e glorious Promi&s;es of God, concerning what he hath &s;aid of me in the latter Days, do revive my Heart; for tho' I have few to plead my Cau&s;e, or to clear my Innocency, and am like to be run down by Apollyon and his &s;purious Off-&s;pring; Lu&s;t and Ungodline&s;s, yet I &s;ee my Day is a coming <HI>when &s;in &s;hall be a&s;hamed, and iniquity &s;top her mouth,</HI> P&s;al. 107.42. <HI>When the holy of the Lord &s;hall be e&s;temed honourable,</HI> and it &s;hall be a Reproach to the Wicked.

<P>Your Go&s;pel is none of the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, nor can you be ju&s;tified by &s;uch a Righteou&s;ne&s;s; for if your Righteou&s;ne&s;s be mix'd with the Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t, it renders the very Righteou&s;ne&s;s of Chri&s;t imper|fect, and full of &s;pots, as an old piece of Cloth put to a new glorious Garment marrs all its Beauty. Sir, doth not filth cleave to your be&s;t Duties of Obedience? Be&s;ides, Works and Grace cannot mix together, <HI>Rom.</HI> 11.6. It mu&s;t be wholly of Grace, or el&s;e wholly of Works.</P>
<P>Moreover, the Law of perfect Obedience, re&s;ulted from God's pure Nature, and not only from his &s;overeign Will and Plea&s;ure, and remains al&s;o the &s;ame for ever; Chri&s;t has not removed it, tho' he has removed it as a Covenant of Works, yet not as a Rule of Obedience. Friend, this Doctrine of yours is again&s;t my very Being, and it has al|mo&s;t ruined me, putting me to &s;hame and contempt: And, Sir, know, if God's holy Nature is &s;uch, that he could accept of imperfect Obedience, &s;incerely performed, why did he not give &s;uch a Law at fir&s;t? and &s;o have &s;aved the Life of his own Son whom he &s;ent to &s;atisfy for Man's Di&s;obedience to his holy Law, to &s;hew his Nature, <HI>i. e.</HI> that he is Ju&s;t as well as Gracious.

<P>What, actually &amp; per&s;onally ju&s;tified, &amp; yet actu|ally and per&s;onally condemned at one and the &s;ame time! this is &s;trange! And now, that <HI>Adam,</HI> for his fir&s;t Sin, fell under Wrath and Condemnation, is evident; and he being a publick Per&s;on, all the Elect were bro't under the &s;ame Condemnation, &amp; that Sin is charged upon, &amp; imputed to all Per&s;ons, as they come into the World, and partake of his corrupt Nature, and are Children of Wrath as well as all others, becoming &s;o by their own actual Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, and abide in that State until they are tran&s;planted out of that dead Root, and are implanted into Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and partake of a virtual Union with him, <HI>John</HI> 3.18, 36.</P>
<P>Can Sin and Righteou&s;ne&s;s be imputed and charged upon a Per&s;on at the &s;ame Time? Or are Unbelievers ju&s;tified Per&s;ons?

The Word of God te&s;tifieth, and &s;o doth the Holy Gho&s;t, al&s;o by Convictions, when he fir&s;t works upon the Hearts and Con&s;ciences of Sinners; therefore your Notion charges the Holy Gho&s;t to be a liar.</P>

<P>That which doth &s;ecure Men from Wrath, and whereby they are di&s;charged and acquitted from their Sins is Ju&s;tification; and by this immanent act of God all the Elect are di&s;charged and acquitted from their Sins, and &s;ecure from Wrath and Hell.</P>

<SPEAKER>Godli.</SPEAKER>
<P>You do not argue well, I &s;hall di&s;tingui&s;h upon your fir&s;t Propo&s;ition, <HI>i. e.</HI> that which doth &s;ecure pre|&s;ently, actually, fully, and formerly from Wrath, with|out any other cau&s;e intervening, is Ju&s;tification; but I deny that Election doth pre&s;ently, (as an immanent Act in God) actually fully and formerly di&s;charge the Elect from Sin, Guilt and Wrath; no, it is but a purpo&s;e in God &s;o to do, were they not really guilty or charged from
<PB N="90" REF="040363_0048_101666C5599FDC38">eternity, or did not God as much decree to charge his Elect with Sin, as he decreed al&s;o in and thro' Chri&s;t, to acquit, ju&s;tify or pronounce them di&s;charged and free from Guilt, Sin and Wrath. Sir, the Elect are born in Sin, and Chil|dren of Wrath by Nature, which they could not be, if their Per&s;ons were ju&s;tified from eternity, and &s;o continue until Effectual Calling: Al&s;o was not the Death of Chri&s;t a nece&s;&s;ary cau&s;e intervening between this Degree and their Di&s;charge, for which they are di&s;charged, and without which they could not &s;o be? and doth not the Work of the Spirit, in uniting them to Chri&s;t, intervene al&s;o?

<P>Election &amp; the Death of Chri&s;t, 'tis true, &s;ecures them from the execution of God's Wrath, but it did not &s;ecure them from falling under the Sentence of his vindictive Wrath and Ju&s;tice, and 'tis true, Sin &s;hall not be imputed to them, to their Damnation in Hell; Election &s;ecures them from that, therefore when <HI>Paul</HI> &s;aith, <HI>Who &s;hall lay any thing to the charge of God's elect?</HI> Rom. 8.34. he &s;peaks of &s;uch of them that are in Chri&s;t, <HI>ver.</HI> 31. or are effectually called, <HI>ver.</HI> 29, 30. namely Elect Believers; for you dare not deny but the Law of God doth lay heavy things to their Charge before, and what the Law of God doth, God him&s;elf doth.</P>

<P><PB N="91" REF="040363_0048_101666C5599FDC38">
Faith is the In&s;trument I do own, by which (when the Spirit is in&s;ufed into the Soul) the Creature receives Chri&s;t and his Righteou&s;ne&s;s, yet the Spirit (or rather Chri&s;t by the Spirit) I affirm does apprehend the Sinner, before the Sinner can, by Faith apprehend Chri&s;t, tho' the Union is not mutual or compleat, until the Soul is reconciled to God, as well as God is reconciled unto the Soul.</P>
<P><HI>Friend,</HI> dare you &s;ay, that actual Ju&s;tification of a Per|&s;on is without Faith? you may (&s;hould you &s;o &s;ay) affirm Men have life in them, who never eat Chri&s;t's Fle&s;h, nor drink his Blood, which the Lord Chri&s;t &s;ays po&s;itively they have not, nor can have.

<P>What tho' Believers, as to vindictive Wrath and Ju&s;tice, are pardoned for ever, as to all Sins pa&s;t, pre&s;ent and to come, mu&s;t they not therefore beg Forgivene&s;s? may they not de&s;ire God to impute Chri&s;t's Righteo&s;ne&s;s to them, becau&s;e they believe God doth do it? and may they not al&s;o pray that God would pa&s;s by their common In|firmities, as a tender Father, and cha&s;ten them.</P>
<P>Moreover, Friend, is not that an evil Notion, that renders Sin in the Elect, a &s;mall and trivial Thing in the Sight of God?

<P>But doth it from hence follow he is not offended with them for their Sins, and as a di&s;plea&s;ed and grieved Father, will not cha&s;ti&s;e them?

<P>Sir, if you plea&s;e to give me his Character, or give me &s;ome certain Signs of his Behaviour and Pro|perties, whereby I may know him, I will faithfully di&s;co|ver all that I under&s;tand as touching this Matter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Godli.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Con&s;cience</HI> I thank you, you &s;peak like an hone&s;t Man, and indeed I have always found you impartial, ac|cording to your Light. I will then give you &s;uch a De|&s;cription of this &s;ubtil and deceitful Enemy of mine, that you cannot well mi&s;take; and this I &s;hall do, by pro|pounding a few Que&s;tions to you.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Sir, Was he ever thoroughly wounded in the Sen&s;e of Sin, as 'tis Sin, being convinced of the ugly and abominable Nature thereof; there being nothing in all the World more hateful to God than that, not only con|vinced of the Evil which does attend it, or is the Fruit of it, but al&s;o of that cur&s;ed Evil there is in it, it being utterly contrary to the holy and pure Nature of God, a Breach of his Law, and that which hath made a Breach between God and Man, and ba&s;ety defaced the Image of God if him, and is the ab&s;olute Cau&s;e of all that abomi|nable Enmity that is in his Heart again&s;t God and me his ble&s;&s;ed Off-&s;pring; and al&s;o makes Man in love with the
<PB N="98" REF="040363_0052_101666D253FA0F38">Ways of the Devil, nay, to be like the Devil, conforma|ble to him, and to do his Will.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Is there no one Sin that he &s;ecretly loves and lives in, (the evil Habits never being broken?) Have you found him now and then telling a Lie for his Advantage Sake, or in telling of Tales or Stories, adding to them, to plea&s;e the Company, or to excu&s;e him&s;elf when accu|&s;ed of this or that, that &s;o he may gain Credit? Is he not &s;ometimes overtaken by Drunkenne&s;s? Is he not proud, minding more the Honour, Prai&s;e, and Applau&s;e of Men in what he doth in Religion, than the Prai&s;e of God? Is he not Covetous? Doth he give according to his Ability to the Poor? Doth he not rob God to &s;erve the World? I mean neglect hearing of God's Word, and other indi&s;|pen&s;able Duties, for worldly Profit Sake, and &s;o prefer the World above the Word? Doth he never in Trading offend you, in &s;peaking better of his Commodities than they de&s;erve? Is not the World more in his Love and Affections than God and Je&s;us Chri&s;t? Does he always give good and ju&s;t Weight and Mea&s;ure, and not take unlawful Profit? Doth he not make Gain of Godline&s;s, and u&s;e Religion as a Cloak, to cover his &s;ecret Sins; doth he concern him&s;elf for the Intere&s;t of the Go&s;pel, and his open-heartedne&s;s &s;hew upon that account he loves Chri&s;t above Son or Daughter? Is he re&s;olved to part with all rather than to &s;in again&s;t God &amp; to offend his Con&s;cience Doth he &s;ee more evil in the lea&s;t Sin, than in the greate&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Sufferings?</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> Doth he de&s;ire as much to have his Sins mor|tified as pardoned? To be made holy here, as well as happy hereafter? is he as much in love with the Work of holi|ne&s;s, as with the Wages of holine&s;s? Doth he love the Word of God becau&s;e of the purity of it? Is he willing to bear the Cro&s;s as well as wear the Crown? To be with
<PB N="99" REF="040363_0052_101666D253FA0F38">Chri&s;t in his Exaltations hereafter? To live to God on Earth, as well as to live with God in Heaven?</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> Is he the &s;ame in private as in publick? Doth he not re&s;t &s;atisfied upon the bare performance of Duty, not minding whether he hath met with God or not? Doth he Pray in publick, as if Men &s;aw him, and in private, as knowing God &s;ees him? Doth not his &s;atisfaction more lie in his a&s;king of God; than in his receiving from God? Does he not &s;eek more for &s;uitable Words in Prayer, than for a &s;uitable Heart? Doth he not &s;tudy more for acute expre&s;&s;ions to affect the Hearts of others, than to meet with powerful Impre&s;&s;ions upon his own? Doth he not lengthen his Prayers before others, and hurry them over in private? Doth he as much endeavour after what he needs from God, as that which he needs of God?</P>
<P><HI>Fifthly,</HI> Can he bear Reproofs kindly for his Faults, and take them patiently? Nay, and e&s;teem him his great|e&s;t Friend, who deals mo&s;t cordially with him? Is he ready to take &s;hame to him&s;elf, and give glory to God? Can he be contented in the Ways of God, though he meets with little &s;en&s;ible comfort from God, nor outward re&s;pect from Saints.</P>
<P><HI>Sixthly,</HI> Doth he as much de&s;ire to have his Heart filled with Grace, as his Head with Knowledge? Doth he take as much care to make the Glory of God his end in what he hath, as the Command of God his ground in what he doth?</P>
<P><HI>Seventhly;</HI> Is he not more &s;evere in pre&s;&s;ing the le&s;&s;er concerns of Religion, than in urging the greater? Doth he not require tho&s;e Duties of others, which he him&s;elf is loth to practice? Is he not more curious to know other Men's Conditions than his own?</P>
<P><HI>Eighthly,</HI> Hath he received a whole Chri&s;t with a whole Heart? <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> A whole Chri&s;t comprehends all his Offices,
<PB N="100" REF="040363_0053_101666D56C1654C8">and a whole Heart comprehends all his Faculties? Hath he received Chri&s;t, not only as a Prie&s;t, to die for him, but al&s;o as a Prince, to rule over him? Doth he obey all God's Precepts, as well as believe all God's Pro|mi&s;es? <HI>Secondly,</HI> As to his Faculties, his Under&s;tanding may be &s;omewhat enlightened, but his Affections may be Carnal, and his Will oppo&s;e me, being aver&s;e to true Godline&s;s? Is not his Heart divided? Come Con&s;cience, I do now command you, in the pre&s;ence of the great and dreadful GOD, who &s;earches all Hearts, to make a righ|teous Deci&s;ion; tell me plainly, is my Enemy <HI>Hypocri&s;y</HI> here or no? By the&s;e brief Hints you may ea&s;ily know him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Con&s;cience,</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, I mu&s;t confe&s;s <HI>Hypocri&s;y</HI> is here; now I have found him out; nay, Sir, and he hath hid him &s;e|cretly in his Hou&s;e, ever &s;ince he came to live in this Town <HI>Religion</HI> he is &s;eemingly holy but really wicked? He loves the face of Holine&s;s, but is without the Grace of Ho|line&s;s; his greate&s;t Care hath been to Wa&s;h the out-&s;ide of his Platter: If he can but keep his Name from being reproached by Men, he cares not tho' his Heart be grie|vou&s;ly defiled before God. Should I tell you of all tho&s;e Lu&s;ts which he harbours in his Heart, and what Favour he &s;hews to that old Man, (you mentioned before) I &s;hould quite &s;hame him; he is a Saint indeed abroad, but a Hea|then (to &s;ay no wor&s;e) at home, he Prays, Hears and Reads, but 'tis to keep up his Credit. Name and E&s;teem among&s;t many Chri&s;tian Men of this Town; for I have often found him very weary of the&s;e Duties, God knows as well as I; nay, Sir, he would &s;eldom Pray at all, were it not to quiet me, for he doth not love my La&s;hes; be&s;ides, he performs them with a &s;ad, cold, dead, carnal and lifele&s;s Spirit; he is much for the le&s;&s;er Things of Religion, (as you minded) he keeps a mighty &s;tir about <HI>Mint, Ani&s;e</HI> and <HI>Cummin,</HI> but quite neglects the greater and more weighty Things; nay, there is one thing more I will tell you, as he does not love

Sir, he is a meer Di&s;&s;embler, yet he would be tho't as religious a Man as any in Town: I find him al&s;o much abroad, finding of Faults of others, or e&s;pying the Mote that is in his Brother's Eye, but never minds the Beam that is in his own; nay, and he is ready to fall out with many good Chri&s;tians, becau&s;e they will not follow him in Habit, Mode and Ge&s;ture, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> In a Word, mo&s;t of all tho&s;e black marks of this deceitful Vil|lan <HI>Hypocri&s;y</HI> you hinted at, I find in him.</P>

Sir, 'tis you who have brought &s;o great a Reproach upon this poor Town Religion, and on all its Inhabitants; nay, and 'tis through your means I am &s;o ba&s;ely vilified &amp; condemned by that blind fellow <HI>Ignorance,</HI> for he is ready to conclude, that all my friends and true favourites are &s;uch as your &s;elf, <HI>viz.</HI> meer loo&s;e and formal Hypocrites, be&s;ides, you are like to be undone, and peri&s;h for ever, unle&s;s you do the &s;ooner turn this vile Enemy of mine out of Doors; for I expect no other but that you will in a little time fall into Apo&s;tacy: But &s;hould you die fir&s;t, yet a&s;&s;ure your &s;elf you will be damned; for Hell is indeed prepared for &s;uch as you are; you are, poor crea|ture! in the wor&s;t Condition of all Men: For the wicked hate you becau&s;e you pretend &s;o much love to Religion and Godline&s;s; God al&s;o, becau&s;e you are not real, but only pretend love to them, being not &s;incere and upright in your Profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
</SP>
<P><HI>Formali&s;t</HI> at this began to be very angry, being greatly offended at true Godline&s;s, for he could not endure to &s;ee his State ript open, nor did he like to hear of his pre&s;ent nor future Mi&s;ery; being per&s;waded by Mr. Vain-hope.
<PB N="102" REF="040363_0054_101666D7038104B8">Unbelief and Good-opinion, to think his Condition, but for this, might be &s;afe enough; however Vain-hope told him, though at pre&s;ent his State might be doubtful, yet he &s;hould have many Days on Earth, and that he might Repent, and &s;et all Things right before he died; who&s;e Word and Promi&s;e he adventured to take; and &s;o bid true Godline&s;s adieu, and no Man's State in all his travels, he did indeed more lament, and his Soul being almo&s;t overwhelmed with Sorrow, he broke out to this purpo&s;e, and departed.</P>

<L>Pa&s;&s;ion o'erflows! why melt I thus with Grief,</L>
<L>For him, who&s;e trait'rous Heart denies Relief?</L>
<L>But what could I expect, fal&s;e Wretch? from thee,</L>

<P>Shewing how <HI>Godline&s;s</HI> coming to one <HI>Thought|ful</HI>'s Hou&s;e, found there his Friend <HI>Con&s;ide|ration,</HI> whom he had a long Time &s;ought for; al&s;o the great Oppo&s;ition <HI>Con&s;ideration</HI> met withal.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>GOdline&s;s</HI> being not without Hopes of finding &s;erious Con&s;ideration (for &s;o &s;ometimes he is called) in or near this Place, chanc'd to knock (as you heard before) at a Man's Door, who was newly come to dwell in the Town Religion. Now, this Per&s;on formerly (as it ap|pears): had been a very great Enemy to true Godline&s;s, having liv'd a grievous loo&s;e and profu&s;e Life, and like the poor Prodigal, wa&s;ted all his chiefe&s;t Sub&s;tance. God|line&s;s had not long knock'd and call'd at his Door before he li&s;tned to him, and &s;pake within him&s;elf to this purpo&s;e. Who is this that is come to my Door? &s;ure, &s;aid he, this is a Voice different from any I ever heard in my Life; and he doth not knock al&s;o as others u&s;e to do: At la&s;t he cried out, who is there? ho is it that is at my Door? your Name Sir?</P>
<P><HI>Godli.</HI> Soul, Chri&s;t is at thy Door, and I his noble and renowned Off-&s;pring, True Godline&s;s. Do&s;t thou re|member that Word, <HI>Behold I &s;tand at the Door, and knock,</HI> Rev. 3.20. Sir, now I will a&s;k you the like Que&s;tion, pray what is your Name? I hope I am come to the right Door.</P>
<P>He told him his Name might very well be called loo&s;e and ungodly <HI>Prodigal;</HI> for (&s;aid he) I have hitherto liv|ed
<PB N="111" REF="040363_0058_1016682FD9F6ED48">a very wicked Life: But &s;ome call me of late <HI>Thought|ful,</HI> becau&s;e I am (ble&s;&s;ed be God) newly come to my &s;elf, by thinking upon my latter End, and the Evil of my for|mer Ways.</P>
<P><HI>Godli.</HI> But why do&s;t thou choo&s;e to take up thy Dwel|ling in this Village now, when &s;o many are going out?</P>
<P><HI>Thoughtful.</HI> Sir, 'tis becau&s;e I hear it is the be&s;t Town in all the Country to &s;ecure a Man from Danger in evil Times, provided I can but get a Place in one of its &s;trong Holds in the Heart of the Town: For I hear there is no &s;afe dwelling at the Town's End, no, nor any where in the Suburbs.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, I was told lately, that <HI>Babylon,</HI> where I have dwelt 'till of late, will &s;uddenly be de&s;troyed: I do it in|deed to &s;ave my own Soul; I am, Sir, de&s;irous to find out (if it may be) where true Peace, Happine&s;s, and eternal Felicity is to be had; For I &s;ee they are not to be found in tho&s;e Paths in which I formerly walked; I mean in the Ways of Riches, Honour, and the Plea&s;ures of this World.</P>
<P><HI>Godli.</HI> I commend thee, hone&s;t <HI>Thoughtful;</HI> thou ha&s;t done wi&s;ely, and like a con&s;iderate Man; prithee let me come in and dwell with thee, and thou wilt find this poor Town the mo&s;t &s;afe and mo&s;t &s;ecure Place in the&s;e dange|rous Times, in all the World. Sir, I have wandered a|bout a long Time, travelling from Place to Place, to &s;eek for one whom I bear much Good-Will to, but hitherto I have not found him; his Name is <HI>Con&s;ideration;</HI> and ma|ny Things more he &s;aid, to make him in Love with <HI>True Godline&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>Upon this, <HI>Con&s;ideration,</HI> who it &s;eems was within, whi&s;pers <HI>Thoughtful</HI> in his Ear, and &s;aid, This is he that can alone make thee happy, if he be readily, &s;incerely, and heartily embraced and entertained. Is it not good for thee to mu&s;e upon the Worth and excellent Nature of
<PB N="112" REF="040363_0059_101668324FFACA30">thy Soul? Thou art made a Man, &amp; therefore for a nobler and higher End and Imployment (&s;ure) than eating and drinking, &s;leeping and playing, and wholly to mind thy Trade and &s;ecular Affairs, and to enjoy &s;en&s;ual Plea&s;ures, (a Happine&s;s which Bea&s;ts arrive to as well as thee) for this glorious Soul which lies in thy Bo&s;om, is capable of knowing God, and of enjoying Union and Communion with him for ever; &s;o that all tho&s;e who &s;uffer the Ho|nours, Profits, and Plea&s;ures of the World, to take up and engro&s;s their Hearts, go a&s;tray, and err from the great End of their Creation. Alas, there is nothing that can fill the De&s;ires of thy Soul, or be its Summum Bonum, but God him&s;elf: Thou ha&s;t hitherto &s;uffered thy Affections and De&s;ires to run after what&s;oever thou coulde&s;t think might yield thee true Felicity; but it is evident there is nothing thou can&s;t find here below, that can &s;atisfy thy thir&s;ty and ever craving Soul.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Riches which &s;ometimes thy Heart hath been &s;o much &s;et upon, cannot be thy Summum Bonum, or chief Happine&s;s; for they are uncertain, fleeting and vari|able Things; and let a Man have never &s;o much of them, yet he is &s;till craving and de&s;iring more, &s;o that 'tis as <HI>Solo|mon</HI> &s;ays, <HI>He that de&s;ireth Silver, &s;hall not be &s;atisfied with Silver.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Secondly,</HI> Honours are of like Nature; and be&s;ides their Vanity, they depend on the Minds, Wills, and Humours of Men, who are changeable and uncon&s;tant.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Thirdly,</HI> Plea&s;ures and Voluptuou&s;ne&s;s, they are com|mon (as I told thee) with Bea&s;ts as well as Men, and al&s;o have&punc; annexed their Sting and Di&s;contention when they are pa&s;t.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>Be&s;ides all this, Con&s;ideration, to induce him to open to true Godline&s;s, bid him ask his Soul, in what State it now was; What it was a doing; And whither it was a going.</P>

<PB N="113" REF="040363_0059_101668324FFACA30">
<ITEM><HI>Fir&s;t.</HI> He endeavoured to &s;how him, that his Soul was in the Gall of Bitterne&s;s, and in the Bond of Iniquity, being under the Law and Cur&s;e of God, both in Re&s;pect of original and actual Sin; he having not clo&s;ed with Chri&s;t, nor received True Godline&s;s.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Secondly,</HI> Then as to what he was a doing, he bid him &s;ee if he did not neglect that one Thing needful. Have you, &s;aid Con&s;ideration, made Religion your chief Bu&s;i|ne&s;s, &s;ince you came to live in this Place? Have you not rather &s;pent too much of your Time about Notions and airy Speculations?</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Thirdly,</HI> Whither are you a going? &s;aid he: Are you fit (being well prepared) to die? Are you going the Way to Heaven? Sure that cannot be, unle&s;s you receive True Godline&s;s: For I have heard that it con&s;i&s;ts in a right Faith, as well as a holy Life. Oh what Co&s;t, Labour, Pains, Means, Motives, and Arguments, hath God u&s;ed to make Men &s;en&s;ible of the everla&s;ting Intere&s;t of their Souls, and to engage them to a &s;erious Preparation for another World.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>And this &s;erious Preparation mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be a thoro' Work of Regeneration, Faith and &s;potle&s;s Conver&s;ation; for the Nature of the Means (&s;aith he) mu&s;t ever be &s;uitable and agreeable to the nature of the end. And Heaven being a holy place, nothing but perfect Holine&s;s reigning there, &s;o it will be impo&s;&s;ible to enter into it here|after, without a con&s;iderable Progre&s;s was made in Holi|ne&s;s here; and that it was not to be tho't a Man could reach to the highe&s;t &s;tep of a Ladder without a&s;cending the lowermo&s;t fir&s;t. Who (&s;aid he) ever hoped for a Crop of Corn without Sowing any? or expected to Reap Wheat and &s;owed nothing but Tares?</P>
<P>He laid al&s;o before him the Nature and Holine&s;s of God, his infinite Hatred of Sin, and great Severity again&s;t all
<PB N="114" REF="040363_0060_10166835519A64B8">unbelieving and impenitent Souls, together with the per|fect Knowledge he had of the Hearts, Thoughts and Ways of the Children of Men; likewi&s;e his dreadful Judgments, Commands, Threats, and precious Promi&s;es.</P>
<P>He brought to his Mind al&s;o the Evil of Sin, &s;hewing him what an abominable Thing it was for Man to &s;eek to plea&s;e, obey, and do the Will of the Devil, and offend, di&s;obey, and cro&s;s the Will of God. Nay, and he began to &s;peak of the Excellency of True Godline&s;s al&s;o, and what he &s;hould gain by embracing him, and letting Chri&s;t and the Spirit of Chri&s;t, Chri&s;t and the Grace of Chri&s;t, Chri&s;t and True Godline&s;s reign in his Heart. Nay he had &s;o much to &s;ay, that had he not been oppo&s;ed and ba&s;e|ly ob&s;tructed (with &s;ome other Help) <HI>Thoughtful</HI> had pre|&s;ently opened the Door to <HI>True Godline&s;s:</HI> But, alas, on a &s;udden there was great Di&s;turbance in the Hou&s;e, and poor <HI>Con&s;ideration</HI> went to the Walls, and was almo&s;t utterly expell'd his Tabernacle.</P>
<P>Now the Enemies he met with were the&s;e; <HI>Difficulty, Sloth, Deficiency, Security, Danger, Worldly-Cares</HI> and <HI>Carnal Company:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The chiefe&s;t Enemies to <HI>Con&s;ideration.</HI></NOTE> The&s;e and many other Enemies appeared to ob&s;truct and hinder Con&s;ideration about this important Bu&s;ine&s;s of opening to True Godline&s;s.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t, Difficulty</HI> &s;poke after this Manner: Sir, Do not trouble your &s;elf to find out the&s;e great My&s;teries of Re|ligion and Godline&s;s, for it is a Work too hard and diffi|cult for you to under&s;tand, there is nothing in the World more ab&s;tru&s;e and my&s;terious; therefore to mu&s;e upon them, would be lo&s;t Labour.</P>
<P><HI>Sloth</HI> told him, it was laborious and toil&s;ome Work, and it would be great Weari&s;omne&s;s to him, if the Diffi|culty did not make it impo&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="040363_0060_10166835519A64B8">
<HI>Deficiency</HI> &s;aid, he was a Man of a weak Under&s;tanding, and tho&s;e Things were Matters for the Learned and mo&s;t knowing Men of all to Study, nay, and that many of them too, notwith&s;tanding all their profound Learning, profici|ency and &s;kill in the Tongues, could hardly attain to the right Knowledge of them.</P>
<P><HI>Security</HI> endeavoured to make it appear his Condition was very good and &s;afe now, and that he had Religion and Godline&s;s enough, without troubling him&s;elf farther, and that he exceeded in Holine&s;s many Men that had lived long in the Town. Moreover, he told him, that he had followed the Coun&s;el of Con&s;ideration too much already.</P>
<P><HI>Danger</HI> too &s;poke &s;everal Things. 1. That to give place to him, would let in his Enemy <HI>Melancholly,</HI> which might endanger his Life. Do not you &s;ee (&s;aith he) how un|comfortable this Fellow <HI>Con&s;ideration</HI> has made many brave Men, cau&s;ing them, by thinking on their latter Ends, to hang down their Heads like a Bull-ru&s;h, fold their Arms and &s;pend their Days in Tears and Weeping; hearken not to him, for he will certainly infu&s;e &s;ad Thoughts into your Mind, and give you nothing but Gall and Vinegar to Drink. 2. He &s;aid moreover, <HI>Con&s;ideration</HI> had made many Men go be&s;ides them&s;elves; and if he did adhere to him, about this Affair, he would be di&s;tracted. 3. He infinuated al&s;o, that if he did &s;eriou&s;ly mu&s;e upon this Mat|ter, or give Place to Con&s;ideration, &s;o that Godline&s;s came to be let in, he would be undone, and utterly ruin'd, the Times are &s;uch.</P>
<P><HI>Worldly-Cares</HI> proved as great an Enemy to <HI>Con&s;ideration</HI> as any of them, for he could not &s;eriou&s;ly mu&s;e, nor think upon Eternity, or the pre&s;ent Condition his poor Soul was in; he was &s;o hurried in his Mind about the Affairs of this Life: Nay, no &s;ooner at any Sea&s;on that he &s;et him&s;elf to ruminate or ponder them in his Mind, but worldly Cares would expell and drive &s;uch Thoughts away.</P>
<P><PB N="116" REF="040363_0061_10166837EC341210">
Old Companions and carnal Company did greatly abu&s;e <HI>Con&s;ideration,</HI> by endeavouring to make him out of Love with a virtuous Life: The&s;e laboured to fawn him into Mi&s;ery, and to tickle him into an Eternity of Torment; they turn'd Religion and Godline&s;s into a Je&s;t, and made the Precepts of the Go&s;pel Matter for Railery, and told him, that tho&s;e Men that &s;eemed mo&s;t &s;erious, were the mo&s;t &s;editious, and that their Profe&s;&s;ion &s;avoured of nothing but of Pride, Singularity and Hypocri&s;y.</P>

Was it not he likewi&s;e that made the poor Widow to prevail with the unju&s;t Judge to a|venge her of her Adver&s;ary? Nay, in a Word, the Pro|mi&s;e of God is made to him, <HI>If you follow on to know the Lord, then you &s;hall know him.</HI> 'Tis this diligent, painful Per&s;on that makes Men (with God's Ble&s;&s;ing) rich, I mean &s;piritually rich: And this I mu&s;t tell thee too, he can do nothing of him&s;elf; do not think that he can open the

<P>Why he commonly &s;tirs up Men to do what they can to open the Door to me, he is a great Enemy to Sloth and Idlene&s;s, he makes them to ri&s;e betimes in the Morning to call upon God, and to read God's Word, and pry into it very diligently, and he will cau&s;e thee to incline thine Ear to what Con&s;cience &s;ays, and make thee tremble at his Reproofs and Accu&s;ations, when you &s;in again&s;t God, if you will but take his Coun&s;el: He will al&s;o cau&s;e thee to go to hear Sermons, and not to &s;leep when you come there, nor neglect, nor &s;light Convictions, nor be carele&s;s and remi&s;s in any Duty, and will help thee to la|bour after Faith, and not to re&s;t upon any Thing &s;hort of Chri&s;t.</P>

Upon this he became very diligent in attending upon all the Means of Grace.

Ha&s;t thou God for thy God, Chri&s;t for thy Sa|viour, the Holy Spirit for thy Comforter, and yet not content! Nay, Doth God, Chri&s;t, and the Holy Spirit dwell with thee, and yet not content!

<ITEM><HI>Fourthly,</HI> Ponder, &s;aith Con&s;ideration, upon the Evils of Di&s;content; Oh what Di&s;honour doth it bring unto God! What Reproach to true Godline&s;s? And what great Wrong to thy own Soul?</ITEM>
