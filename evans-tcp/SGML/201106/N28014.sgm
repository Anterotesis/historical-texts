<HEAD>A plain and &s;erious Addre&s;s, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU may ea&s;ily apprehend, that the many interruptions to which per&s;onal vi&s;its are liable, make it difficult for mini&s;ters to find a convenient time, in which they may apply them&s;elves &s;uitably and largely to tho&s;e com|itted to their care, or at lea&s;t, if they re&s;olve to do it, will nece&s;&s;arily make their progre&s;s through large congregations very &s;low. I there|fore take this method of vi&s;iting you <HI>while a|lone,</HI> and of addre&s;&s;ing you on the very impor|tant &s;ubject of <HI>Family-Religion.</HI> For your own &s;ake, and the &s;ake of tho&s;e deare&s;t to you, I en|treat you to give a calm attentive hearing. And I would particularly de&s;ire, that if it be by any means practicable (as with a little contrivance and re&s;olution I hope it may) you would &s;ecure one hour on the morning of the Lord's day af|ter you receive it, not merely to run over this letter in a cur&s;ory manner, but deliberately to weigh and con&s;ider it, and to come to &s;ome de|termination, as in the &s;ight of God, that <HI>you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> will not,</HI> comply with the <HI>pe|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ition</HI> which it brings; if I may not rather &s;ay, with the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">mand</HI> which in <HI>his name</HI> it makes up|on you.</P>
<P>As I purpo&s;e to deliver it to every ma&s;ter of a family under my &s;tated care, or to every mi&s;|tre&s;s
<PB N="4" REF="037329_0003_100CB935E495BCE8">where there is no ma&s;ter (that no offence of any kind may be taken, which it is in my power to prevent) I know it will come to many, who have long been exemplary f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">heir dili|gence and zeal in the duties I am recommend|ing; to many, whom their own experience hath in&s;tructed in the plea&s;ures and advantages which flow from them; an experience which will enforce them more effectually than any thing which it is po&s;&s;ible for me to &s;ay. Such will I hope, by what they read be confirmed in pur&s;uing the good re&s;olution they have taken, and the good cu&s;toms they have formed; and will al&s;o be excited more earne&s;tly to endeavor to contribute towards introducing the like, into other families over which they have any in|fluence, and e&s;pecially into tho&s;e which may branch out from their own, by the &s;ettlement of children or &s;ervants. In this view, as well as to awaken their thankfulne&s;s to divine grace, which hath inclined them to the di&s;charges of their duty in &s;o great, yet &s;o frequently neg|lected, an article of it, I hope the heads of praying families will not peru&s;e this letter in vain. But it is intended as an addre&s;s to tho&s;e, who have hitherto lived in the omi&s;&s;ion of it: And if there were <HI>but one</HI> &s;uch ma&s;ter of a family under my care, I would gladly &s;ubmit to the labor in which I am now engaging <HI>for his &s;ake alone.</HI> To &s;uch therefore I now turn my&s;elf; and Oh that divine grace might engage every one of &s;uch a character to hear me with
<PB N="5" REF="037329_0004_100CB937679C32A0">attention, and might inforce upon his con|&s;cience the weight of rea&s;ons, the evidence of which the lowe&s;t may receive, and to which it is impo&s;&s;ible that the highe&s;t &s;hould find any thing &s;olid to object!</P>
<P>Oh my dear friend, whoever you are (for I know not one under my care to whom I may not addre&s;s that appellation) give me leave to tell you plainly, that while I write this I have that awakening &s;cripture in my view: <HI>Pour out thy fury upon the heathen that know thee not, and upon THE FAMILIES THAT CALL NOT ON THY NAME.</HI> I appeal to you as a man of ordinary &s;en&s;e and under&s;tanding (as it needs no more) to judge whether this do not &s;trongly imply that it may be taken for grant|ed, <HI>every Family</HI> which is not a <HI>heathen family,</HI> which is not quite ignorant of the living and true God, <HI>will call upon his name.</HI> Well may it then pain my heart, to think that there &s;hould be a profe&s;&s;ed <HI>Chri&s;tian Family,</HI> whom this dreadful character &s;uits. Well may it pain my heart, to think of the <HI>divine fury,</HI> which may be <HI>poured out</HI> on the heads and on the members of it: And well may it make me de|&s;irous, to do my utmo&s;t to &s;ecure you and yours, from every appearance, from every po&s;|&s;ibility, of &s;uch danger. Excu&s;e the earne&s;t|ne&s;s with which I may addre&s;s you. I really fear, le&s;t <HI>while you delay,</HI> the <HI>fire</HI> of the divine di&s;plea&s;ure &s;hould <HI>fall upon you:</HI> And as I a|dore the patience of God in having thus long
<PB N="6" REF="037329_0005_100CB938EC362168">&s;u&s;pended the &s;torm, I am anxious about eve|ry hour's delay, le&s;t it &s;hould fall the heavier.</P>
<P>I will therefore, as plainly and &s;eriou&s;ly as I can, endeavour to convince you of your duty, if peradventure you are not already &s;ecretly convinced of it; as truly I believe, mo&s;t who neglect it, under the regular admini&s;tration of go&s;pel ordinances, are.</P>
<P>I will then touch on a few of the objections, which have been pleaded to excu&s;e in &s;ome de|gree &s;o &s;hameful an omi&s;&s;ion. And this will naturally lead me to conclude with a few hints, which may &s;erve by way of direction, for the proper introduction and di&s;charge of the &s;ervic|es to which I am endeavouring to engage you.</P>
<P>I mean not to handle the &s;ubject at large, which would afford abundant matter for a con|&s;iderable volume; as indeed &s;everal volumes have been written upon it by divines of differ|ent denominations, who, however various in other opinions, agree here; as what intelligent chri&s;tian can di&s;agree? But I mean to &s;ugge&s;t a few plain things, which it is evident you have not &s;ufficiently con&s;idered, and which if duly weighed, may be the ble&s;&s;ing of God an&s;wer my pre&s;ent purpo&s;e. Now the arguments I &s;hall propo&s;e will be &s;uch, that if you will not regard them, little is to be hoped from any other: For &s;urely the mind of man can di&s;cover none of greater and more univer&s;al importance; though I readily acknowledge, that many others might inforce them with greater energy and addre&s;s.
<PB N="7" REF="037329_0006_100CB93A71239318">Yet if the mo&s;t earne&s;t de&s;ires of &s;ucceeding can add any of the proper arts of per&s;ua&s;ion, they will not be wanting here. And I would fain &s;peak, as one who con&s;iders, how much of the glory of God, how much of your own hap|pine&s;s, and that of your dear children, for time and eternity, depend on the &s;ucce&s;s of what I am now to lay before you.</P>
<P>What I de&s;ire and intreat of you is, that you will honour and acknowledge God in your fam|ilies, by calling them together every day to hear &s;ome parts of his word read to them, and to offer for a few minutes at lea&s;t, your united confe&s;&s;ions, prayers and prai&s;es to him. And is this a cau&s;e, that &s;hould need to be pleaded at large by a great variety of united motives? Truly the petition &s;eems &s;o rea&s;onable, and a compliance with it from one who has not quite renounced religion might &s;eem &s;o natural, that one would think the bare propo&s;ing it might &s;uffice. Yet experience tells us, it is much otherwi&s;e. Ths letter will come into the hands of &s;ome, who, though they maintain a public profe&s;&s;ion of religion, have been again and a|gain exhorted to it in vain, and that perhaps for &s;ucceeding years. I might &s;ay a great deal to <HI>upbraid</HI> &s;uch e&s;pecially, on account of this neglect; but I rather chu&s;e to <HI>intreat</HI> to the future performance of the duty; humbly hop|ing, that, criminal as former negligence has been, a gracious God will mercifully forgive it, to tho&s;e who repent and de&s;ire to reform.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="037329_0007_100CB93CB19F6268">
And oh that I could engage you to this, by repre&s;enting in the plaine&s;t, kinde&s;t, and mo&s;t affectionate manner, the <HI>rea&s;onablene&s;s,</HI> and <HI>ad|vantage</HI> of this duty! for if it be rea&s;onable, if it be evidently advantageous, there are num|berle&s;s <HI>general precepts of Scripture,</HI> which mu&s;t comprehend and enforce it, if it were le&s;s im|mediately &s;upported than it is by <HI>particular pa&s;|&s;ages;</HI> which yet, as I &s;hall pre&s;ently &s;hew, do many of them &s;trongly recommend it to us.</P>
<P>Con&s;ider, &s;ir, for I addre&s;s my&s;elf to every particular per&s;on, &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;ider <HI>the appar|ent rea&s;onablene&s;s of family religion.</HI> Mu&s;t not your con&s;ciences pre&s;ently tell you, it is &s;it that per&s;ons who receive &s;o many mercies together, &s;hould acknowledge them together? can you in your own mind be &s;atisfied, that you and your neare&s;t relatives &s;hould pay no joint hom|age to that God, who hath &s;et you in your family, and who hath given to you, and to the &s;everal members of it, &s;o many dome&s;tic en|joyments? your Creator and theirs, your Pre|&s;erver and theirs, your daily Benefactor and theirs? can it be right, if you have any &s;en&s;e of the&s;e things each of you in your own hearts, that the &s;en&s;e of them &s;hould be concealed and &s;mothered there, and that you &s;hould never join in your grateful acknowledgment to him? can you imagine it rea&s;onable, that when you have a con&s;tant dependence upon him for &s;o many mercies, without the concurrence of which your family would be a &s;cene of mi&s;ery,
<PB N="9" REF="037329_0008_100CB940247DA8D8">you &s;hould never pre&s;ent your&s;elves together in his pre&s;ence, to a&s;k them at his hand? up|on what principles, is public wor&s;hip to be recommended and urged, if not by &s;uch as have their proportionable weight here?</P>
<P>Indeed the force of the&s;e con&s;iderations hath not only been known and acknowledged by the People of God in all ages; we have not only <HI>Noah</HI> and <HI>Abraham, Jo&s;hua</HI> and <HI>David, Job</HI> and <HI>Daniel,</HI> each under a much darker di&s;pen|&s;ation than ours, examples of it: but we may venture to &s;ay, that wherever there has been a profe&s;&s;ion of any kind of religion, it has been brought into private hou&s;es as well as public temples. The poor <HI>heathens,</HI> as we certainly know from the remaining monuments of them, had their <HI>Lares</HI> and their <HI>Penates,</HI> which were hou&s;hold images, &s;ome of them in private chapels, and others about the common hearth, where the family u&s;ed to wor&s;hip them by fre|quent prayers and &s;acrifices. And the <HI>bra&s;s,</HI> and <HI>wood,</HI> and <HI>&s;tone,</HI> of which they con&s;i&s;ted, &s;hall (as it were) <HI>cry out again&s;t you,</HI> &s;hall ri&s;e up again&s;t you and condemn you, if while you call your&s;elves the wor&s;hippers of the one liv|ing and Eternal God, and boa&s;t in the revela|tion you have received by his prophets and by his Son, you pre&s;ume to omit an homage, which the &s;tupid wor&s;hippers of &s;uch vanities as the&s;e failed not to pre&s;ent to them, while they called them their Gods. Be per&s;uaded then I be&s;eech you, be con&s;i&s;tent in your
<PB N="10" REF="037329_0009_100CB94249ACFD60">conduct. Either give up all pretences to re|ligion or maintain a &s;teady and uniform regard to it, at home as well as abroad, in the family as well as in the clo&s;et, or at Church. But the rea&s;onablene&s;s of this duty, and the obli|gations which bind you in con&s;cience to the practice of it, will farther appear, if you con|&s;ider,</P>
<P>The many advantages, which will, by the divine ble&s;&s;ing, attend a proper di&s;charge of it. And here, I would more particularly repre&s;ent the good influence, which family devotions are likely to have, upon the young per&s;ons com|mitted to your care, upon your own hearts, and upon the advancement of a general refor|mation, and the propagation of religion to tho&s;e that are yet unborn.</P>
<P>Con&s;ider in the fir&s;t place, what is mo&s;t ob|vious, the happy influence which the duty I am r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">mmending might have upon the young members of your family, the <HI>children</HI> and <HI>&s;er|vants</HI> committed to your care. For I now con|&s;ider you, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> parent and a ma&s;ter. <HI>The Fath|er of a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"></HI> is a phra&s;e, that comprehends both <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">; and with great proprie|ty, as humanity obliges us to endeavour to take a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> care of all under our roof. And <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">,</P>
<P>You <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ught to con&s;ider your <HI>&s;ervants,</HI> in this view, with a tender regard. They are proba|bly in the flower of life, for that is the age which is commonly &s;pent in &s;ervice; and you
<PB N="11" REF="037329_0010_100CB9446E690EC8">&s;hould recollect how po&s;&s;ible it is, that may be if rightly improved, the be&s;t opportunity their whole life may afford them for learning relig|ion, and being brought under the power of it. If your &s;ervants are already in&s;tructed in it, by being brought up in families where the&s;e duties have been maintained; let them not, if they &s;hould finally mi&s;carry, have cau&s;e to impute it to you, and to te&s;tify before God in the day of their condemnation, "that it was under your roof that they learnt the neglect and for|getfulne&s;s of God, and of all that their pious parents, perhaps in a much infecrior &s;tation of life to you, had in earlier days been attempting to teach them; to teach them, in moments ta|ken from labour, or from repo&s;e almo&s;t nece&s;&s;a|ry for their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. On the other hand if they came to you quite ignorant of religion (as if they came from prayerle&s;s families, it is probable that they do) have compa&s;&s;ion upon them, I entreat you, and endeavour to give them tho&s;e advantages which they never yet had; and which it is too probable, as things are generally managed, they never will have, if you will not afford them.</P>
<P>But I would e&s;pecially, if I might be allowed to borrow the pathetic words of <HI>Job, intreat you by the children of your own body.</HI> I would now as it were pre&s;ent them all before you, and be&s;eech you by all the bowels of parental affection (which I have my&s;elf &s;o &s;trongly felt) that to all the other tokens of tenderne&s;s and
<PB N="12" REF="037329_0011_100CB94696C160E0">love you would not refu&s;e to add this, without which many of the re&s;t may be wor&s;e than in vain.</P>
<P>Give me leave to plead with you, as the in|&s;truments of introducing them into being. O remember, it is indeed a deba&s;ed and corrupted nature you have conveyed to them. Con&s;ider that the world, into which you have been the means of bringing them, is a place in which they are &s;urrounded with many temptations, and in which, as they advance in life, they mu&s;t expect many more, &s;o that in plain terms, it is on the whole much to be feared, that they will peri&s;h in the ignorance and forgetfulne&s;s of God, if they do not learn from you to love and &s;erve him. For how can it be expected they &s;hould learn this at all, if you give them no advantages for receiving and practi&s;ing the le&s;&s;on at home?</P>
<P>And let me further urge and intreat you to remember, that the&s;e dear children, who&s;e ten|der age, and perhaps amiable forms and di&s;po|&s;itions, might attract the affection and &s;olici|tude of &s;trangers, are committed to your e&s;|pecial and immediate care by God their Crea|tor. And he has made them thus dependent upon you, and others that have in their infan|cy and childhood the care of them, that there might be hereafter a better opportunity of for|ming their minds, and of influencing them to a right temper and conduct. And can this by any means be effectually done, if you do not
<PB N="13" REF="037329_0012_100CB948B9D56F68">at proper times call them together, to attend to the in&s;tructions of the word of God, and to join in &s;olemn prayers and &s;upplication to him? at lea&s;t is it po&s;&s;ible it &s;hould be done any other way with equal advantage, if this be not added to the re&s;t?</P>
<P>Family wor&s;hip is a mo&s;t proper way of teaching children religion, as you teach them language, by in&s;en&s;ible degrees; a little one day and a little another; for to them <HI>line mu&s;t he upon line, and precept upon precept.</HI> They may learn to conceive aright of the divine per|fections, which they hear you daily acknowl|edging and adoring them: Their hearts may be early touched with pious remor&s;e for &s;in, when they hear your confe&s;&s;ions out before God: They will know what mercies they are to a&s;k for them&s;elves, by ob&s;erving what turn your petitions take; your interce&s;&s;ions may diffu&s;e into their minds a &s;pirit of love to man|kind, a concern for the intere&s;t of the church, and of their country; and what is not, I think, by any means to be neglected, &s;enti|ments of loyalty towards tho&s;e in authority over us, when they hear you daily invoking the divine ble&s;&s;ings upon them: And your &s;ol|emn thank&s;givings for the bounties of provi|dence, and for benefits of a &s;piritual nature, may affect their hearts with tho&s;e gracious im|pre&s;&s;ions towards the gracious author of all, which may excite in their little brea&s;ts love to him, the mo&s;t noble and genuine principle of
<PB N="14" REF="037329_0013_100CB94ADF9261D8">all true and acceptable religion. Thus they may become chri&s;tians by in&s;en&s;ible degrees, and grow in the knowledge and love of the truth, as they do in &s;tature.</P>
<P>By ob&s;erving your reverent and &s;olemn de|portment (as reverent and &s;olemn I hope it will always at &s;uch &s;ea&s;ons be) they may get &s;ome notion of an invi&s;ible Being, before they are of age to under&s;tand the definition of the term God; and may feel their minds &s;ecretly im|pre&s;&s;ed with an humble awe and veneration, before they can explain to you their &s;en&s;e of it. And whatever in&s;tructions you give them con|cerning his nature and his will, and the way of obtaining his favor by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, all your admonitions relating to the importance of that invi&s;ible world we are going to, and the nece&s;|&s;ary preparation for it will be greatly illu&s;trat|ed by the tenor of your daily devotions, as well as by tho&s;e excellent le&s;&s;ons which the word of God, when &s;olemnly read to them morning and evening, will afford. Nor is it by any means to be forgotten, that while they hear them|&s;elves, and their own concerns, mentioned be|fore God in prayer, while they hear you earn|e&s;tly pleading for the divine ble&s;&s;ings upon them (e&s;pecially if it be in expre&s;&s;ions wi&s;ely varied, as &s;ome particular occurrences in their lives and in yours may require) it may very probably be a means of moving their impre&s;&s;i|ble hearts; as it may powerfully convince them of your deep and tender concern for their
<PB N="15" REF="037329_0014_100CB94D09B9AF60">good, and may add great weight to the in&s;truc|tions you may addre&s;s to them: So that it may appear, even <HI>while you are praying for them,</HI> that God <HI>hears.</HI> And indeed I have known &s;ome in&s;tances of excellent per&s;ons, who have dated their conver&s;ion to God, even after they had begun vi&s;ibly to degenerate, from the pray|ers, from the &s;erious and pathetic prayers, which they have heard their pious fathers, per|haps I might add their pious mothers, pre&s;ent|ing before God on their account.</P>
<P>Indeed were this duty properly attended to, it might be expected, that all chri&s;tian families would, according to their re&s;pective &s;izes and circum&s;tances, become nur&s;eries of piety; and you would &s;ee in the mo&s;t convin&s;ing view, the wi&s;dom of providence, in making human in|fants &s;o much more dependent on their par|ents, and &s;o much more incapable to &s;hift for them&s;elves, than the offspring of inferior crea|tures are.</P>
<P>Let me then intreat you, my dear friend, to look on your children the very next time you &s;ee them, and a&s;k your own heart, how you can an&s;wer it to God, and to them, that you deprive them of &s;uch advantages as the&s;e? ad|vantages, without which it is to be feared, your care of them in other re&s;pects will turn to but little account, &s;hould they be ever &s;o pro&s;per|ous in life. For what is pro&s;perity in life without the knowledge, and fear, and love of God? what, but the poi&s;on of the &s;oul, which
<PB N="16" REF="037329_0015_100CB94FD06937B8">&s;wells and kills it? what but the means of making it more certainly, more intolerably mi&s;erable; when all its tran&s;ient and empty a|mu&s;ements are pa&s;&s;ed away, <HI>like a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, when one awaketh?</HI> In &s;hort, not to mention the hap|py influence it may have on their temporal af|fairs, by drawing down the divine ble&s;&s;ing, and by forming their minds to tho&s;e virtues which pave the way to wealth and reputation, health and contentment, which make no enem|mies, and attract many friends; it is, with re&s;pect to the eternal world, the greate&s;t cru|elty to your children thus to neglect giving them tho&s;e advantages which <HI>no other cares in education it&s;elf</HI> exclu&s;ive of the&s;e can afford: And it is impo&s;&s;ible, you &s;hould ever be able to give them any other equivalent. If you do your duty in this re&s;pect, they will have rea&s;on to ble&s;s you living and dying: and if you neg|lect it, take care that you and they come not, in con&s;equence of that neglect, into a world, where (horrid as the thought may now &s;eem) you will forever be cur&s;ing each other. And thus I am falling in&s;en&s;ibly, becau&s;e &s;o natu|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ally, from what I was &s;aying of the concern and intere&s;t of tho&s;e under your care, to your own, &s;o far as it may be di&s;tingui&s;hed from theirs.</P>
<P>Let me therefore pre&s;s you to con&s;ider, how much <HI>your own intere&s;t</HI> is concerned in the mat|ter; the whole of your intere&s;t, both &s;piritual and temporal. Your <HI>&s;piritual intere&s;t</HI> is infi|nitely
<PB N="17" REF="037329_0016_100CB95153A09CC8">the greate&s;t, and therefore will begin with that. And here let me &s;eriou&s;ly a&s;k you, do you not need tho&s;e advantages for religion, which the performance of family duty will give you, added to tho&s;e of a more &s;ecret and a more public nature, if peradventure they are regard|ed by you? the&s;e in&s;tructions, the&s;e adorations, the&s;e confe&s;&s;ions, the&s;e &s;upplications, the&s;e in|terce&s;&s;ions, the&s;e thank&s;givings, which may be &s;o u&s;eful to your children and &s;ervants, may they not be u&s;eful to your&s;elves? may not your own hearts have &s;ome peculiar advantage for being impre&s;&s;ed, when you are the mouth of others in the&s;e dome&s;tic devotions, beyond what in a private &s;tation of life it is other|wi&s;e po&s;&s;ible you &s;hould have? Oh the&s;e le&s;|&s;ons of religion to your own &s;ouls, every mor|ning and evening, might be (if I may be al|lowed the expre&s;&s;ion,) either the &s;eed, or fore|ta&s;te, of &s;alvation to you. Nay, the remoter influence they may have on your conduct, in other re&s;pects, and at other times, when con|&s;idered merely in the general as religious exer|ci&s;es performed by you in your family, is to be recollected as an argument of va&s;t importance.</P>
<P>A &s;en&s;e of common decency would engage you, if you pray with your family, to <HI>avoid a great many evils,</HI> which would appear <HI>doubly evil</HI> in a father or a ma&s;ter, who kept up &s;uch religious exerci&s;es in his hou&s;e. I will not now, &s;ir, &s;peak of your&s;elf, for I would not of|fend by &s;uppo&s;ing any thing gro&s;sly bad of
<PB N="18" REF="037329_0017_100CB953B263C3D8">you. But do you imagine, that if reading the &s;cripture and family prayer were introduced in|to the hou&s;es of &s;ome of your neighbours, drunkenne&s;s and lewdne&s;s, and cur&s;ing and &s;wearing, and profaning the Lord's day, would not, like &s;o many <HI>evil demons,</HI> be quickly driven out? the ma&s;ter of the family would not for &s;hame indulge them, if he had nothng more than the form of duty kept up; and <HI>his</HI> re|formation though only external, and at fir&s;t on a kind of con&s;traint, would carry with it the reformation of many more, who have &s;uch a dependence on his favour as they would not &s;acrifice, though by a madne&s;s very prevalent among the children of men they can venture to &s;acrifice their &s;ouls to every trifle.</P>
<P>And may it not perhaps be your more im|mediate concern, to recollect, that if you pray|ed with your family, you would <HI>your&s;elf</HI> be more careful to <HI>ab&s;tain from all appearance of evil?</HI> you would find out a way to &s;uppre&s;s that turbulency of pa&s;&s;ion, which may now be ready to break out before you are aware, and other imprudences, in which your own heart would check you by &s;aying, "does this be|come one, that is by and by to kneel down with his dome&s;tics, his children and &s;ervants, and adore God with them, and pray again&s;t every thing which di&s;plea&s;es God, and makes us unfit for the heavenly world? I will not &s;ay this will cure every thing that is wrong; but I believe you are already per&s;uaded, it
<PB N="19" REF="037329_0018_100CB95537B05900">would often have a very good influence. And I fear, it is the &s;ecret de&s;ire of indulging &s;ome irregularities without &s;uch a re&s;traint, that, in|famous as &s;uch a victory is, hath driven out family prayer from &s;everal hou&s;es where it was once maintained, and hath excluded it from others. But if you have any &s;ecret di&s;inclina|tion of heart ri&s;ing again&s;t it in this view, it becomes you &s;eriou&s;ly to take the alarm; for, to &s;peak plainly, I have hardly known a black|er &s;ymptom of damnation, than a fear of being re&s;trained in the commi&s;&s;ion of &s;in.</P>
<P>After this it may &s;eem a matter of &s;maller importance, to urge the good influence which a proper di&s;charge of family duty may have up|on your own temporal affairs; both by re&s;|training you from many evils and engaging you to a proper conduct your&s;elf, and al&s;o by impre&s;&s;ing your children and &s;ervants, with a &s;en&s;e of religion. And it is certain, the more careful they are of their duty to God, the more likely they will be to perform their duty to you. Nor can any thing &s;trengthen your nat|ural authority among them more than your pre&s;iding in &s;uch &s;olemnities, if &s;upported by a &s;uitable conduct. But I would hope nobler motives will have a &s;uperior weight, and there|fore waving this topic, I intreat you as the la&s;t argument to con&s;ider,</P>
<P>The influence it may have on a general re|formation and on the propagation of religion to tho&s;e who are yet unborn. You ought to
<PB N="20" REF="037329_0019_100CB958A5C28CB8">con&s;ider every child and &s;ervant in your fami|ly, as one who may be a &s;ource, not only of life, but (in &s;ome degree) of character and hap|pine&s;s to tho&s;e who are hereafter to ari&s;e into being: yea, who&s;e conduct may in part affect tho&s;e that are to de&s;cend from them in the fol|lowing generation. If they grow up while un|der your eye, ignorant of religion, they will certainly be much le&s;s capable of teaching it to others; for the&s;e are the years of di&s;ci|pline, and if they be neglected now, there is little probability of their receiving after-in|&s;truction. Nor is this all the evil con&s;e|quence; for it is highly probable that they will think them&s;elves authori&s;ed by your exam|ple to a like negligence, and &s;o you may entail heatheni&s;m under di&s;regarded chri&s;tian forms, on your de&s;cendants and theirs in ages to come. Whereas your diligence and zeal might be re|membered and imitated by them, perhaps when you are in your grave; and the &s;tock which they fir&s;t received from you, might with rich improvements be communicated to great num|bers, &s;o that one generation after another might learn to fear and &s;erve the Lord. On the whole, God only knows what a church may ari&s;e from one godly family, what a harve&s;t may &s;pring up from a &s;ingle &s;eed; and on the other hand, it is impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ay, how many &s;ouls may at length peri&s;h by the treacherous neglect of a &s;ingle per&s;on, and to &s;peak plainly, by your own.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="037329_0020_100CB95A29FAFA90">
The&s;e, &s;ir, are the arguments I had to plead with you, and which I have &s;elected out of ma|ny more: And now give me leave &s;eriou&s;ly to a&s;k you, as in the pre&s;ence of God, whether there be not on the whole an unan&s;werable force in them? And if there be, what follows, but that you immediately yield to that force, and &s;et up family-wor&s;hip <HI>this very day.</HI> For methinks, I would hardly thank you for a re&s;|olution to do it <HI>to-morrow,</HI> &s;o little do I expect from that re&s;olution. How can you excu&s;e your&s;elf in the continued omi&s;&s;ion? Bring the matter before God. He will be the final judge of it: and if you cannot debate the que&s;tion as in his pre&s;ence, it is a &s;ign of a bad cau&s;e, and of a bad heart too; which is con|&s;cious of the badne&s;s of the cau&s;e, and yet will not give it up, nor comply with a duty, of your obligations to which you are &s;ecretly convinc|ed, and yet in effect &s;ay, "I will go on in this &s;in, and venture, the con&s;equence." Oh it is a dreadful venture, and will be found in effect <HI>provoking the Lord to jealou&s;y, as if you were &s;tronger than he.</HI></P>
<P>But perhaps there may ari&s;e in your mind &s;ome objections, which may in &s;ome degree break the force of this conviction, and which in that view it may be expedient for me to di&s;|cu&s;s a little, before I di&s;mi&s;s the &s;ubject, and clo&s;e my addre&s;s to you. You may perhaps be ready to object,</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="22" REF="037329_0021_100CB95C4EFB1158">
1. "That <HI>family-prayer is not</HI> in &s;o many words <HI>commanded in &s;cripture;</HI> and therefore however expedient in &s;ome ca&s;es, it cannot be &s;o univer&s;al and &s;o important a duty, as we re|pre&s;ent it."</P>
<P>I an&s;wer plainly, that it is &s;trongly recom|mended in &s;cripture, and con&s;equentially com|manded; as there are precepts, which plainly include, though they do not particularly ex|pre&s;s it. And I appeal to your&s;elf in this mat|ter. When God is repre&s;ented as giving this rea&s;on to his angels for a particular favor to be be&s;towed on <HI>Abraham</HI> becau&s;e <HI>be knew, that be would command his children and hou&s;hold to keep the way of the Lord, that he might obtain the ble&s;&s;ing promi&s;ed;</HI> did he not intend to declare his approbation of the care he took to &s;upport religion in his family? And can it be &s;upport|ed in a total neglect of prayer? Again, do you not in your con&s;cience think, that the &s;pirit of God meant, that we &s;hould take <HI>Jo&s;hua</HI> for an example, when he tells us that he re&s;olved and publicly declared the re&s;olution, <HI>that he and his hou&s;e would &s;erve the Lord;</HI> which mu&s;t expre&s;s a religious care of his family too? Do you not believe, that this ble&s;&s;ed &s;pirit meant it a com|mendation of <HI>Job</HI> that he <HI>offered-&s;acrifices for all his children;</HI> &s;acrifices, undoubtedly attended with prayers; when he feared le&s;t the gaity of their hearts in their &s;ucce&s;&s;ive fea&s;ting might have betrayed them into &s;ome moral evil? And was it not to do an honor to <HI>David,</HI> that the
<PB N="23" REF="037329_0022_100CB95F1C8CEA08">Scripture informs us, that he <HI>we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> home to ble&s;s his hou&s;hold;</HI> that is, to perform <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> me &s;olemn act of dome&s;tic wor&s;hip when he had been &s;pending the whole day in public devotions; What think you of the example of <HI>Daniel</HI> who prayed in his hou&s;e, with his windows open towards Jeru&s;alem, and would rather run the ri&s;que of being ca&s;t into the den of Lions, and being torn in pieces by tho&s;e cruel bea&s;ts, than he would either omit or conceal it? And do you think, that when our ble&s;&s;ed Lord, who&s;e whole life was employed in religious &s;ervices, &s;o frequently <HI>took his di&s;ciples apart to pray with them,</HI> that he did not intend this as an example to us, of praying with tho&s;e under our &s;pecial care or in other words, with the members of our own family, who are mo&s;t immediately &s;o? Or can you by any imaginable artifice delude your&s;elf &s;o far as to think, that when we are &s;olemnly charged and commanded to pray <HI>with all prayer and &s;upplication,</HI> this kind of prayer is not included in that apo&s;tolical injunction.</P>
<P>On the whole, the que&s;tion lies in a very little room.&mdash;Have I proved by what I have &s;aid before, that <HI>family-prayer</HI> is a rea&s;onable thing? That it has a tendency to promote the honor of God, and the intere&s;t of religion, and your own &s;alvation, with that of tho&s;e who are committed to your care? If you are really convinced of this, then all the general precepts which require the love of God and your neigh|bor, all that recommend a regard to the inter|e&s;t
<PB N="24" REF="037329_0023_100CB9614A6AFE00">of Chri&s;t, and a concern for our own ever|la&s;ting happine&s;s, bind it in this connection as certainly upon us, as if it had been command|ed in words as expre&s;s as tho&s;e, in which we are required <HI>to enter into our clo&s;ets, and there to pray to our father which is in &s;ecret.</HI></P>
<P>And I will farther add, that if the care of <HI>family religion</HI> be (as I &s;uppo&s;e every man's con&s;cience will &s;ecretly te&s;tify that it is) a pro|per part of <HI>religious education,</HI> then all tho&s;e many pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture which recommend this, mu&s;t in all rea&s;on be under&s;tood as in|cluding that. But perhaps you may be ready to plead,</P>
<P N="2">2. "That it is <HI>generally neglected.</HI>"</P>
<P>Yet &s;carce can you have made or thought of this objection, but you will &s;ee at the fir&s;t glance, that this mu&s;t turn upon your&s;elf, rath|er than on the whole appeal favourable to your cau&s;e. It is the reproach of our age, if it be indeed <HI>generally neglected.</HI> And if it be generally excluded from the families of the rich and the great (who too frequently &s;et the fa&s;hion, where they are mo&s;t apt to &s;et it wrong) let it rather awaken a generous indig|nation in our brea&s;t, to think that it is &s;o ex|cluded. At lea&s;t, let it awaken a holy zeal to exert our&s;elves &s;o much the more, as it is cer|tain that no a&s;&s;ociation in vice can &s;ecure tho&s;e that join in it: for it is expre&s;sly &s;aid, <HI>though hand join in hand, the wicked &s;hall not be unpun|i&s;hed.</HI> So will your obedience be the more ac|ceptable,
<PB N="25" REF="037329_0024_100CB962CEE0F5C0">in proportion to the degree in which it is &s;ingular. Were there not one praying family in the whole nation, in the whole world, methinks it &s;hould in&s;tigate you to the practice rather than tempt you to the neglect, and you &s;hould pre&s;s on as ambitious of the glory of <HI>leading the way,</HI> for what could be a nobler object of ambition, than to be pointed out by the ble&s;&s;ed God him&s;elf, as <HI>Job</HI> was; of whom he &s;aid, with a kind of triumph, <HI>ha&s;t thou con&s;idered my &s;ervant Job, that there is none like him in the land,</HI> or even <HI>on the earth?</HI> But ble&s;&s;ed by God, this &s;uppo&s;ed <HI>univer&s;al neglect</HI> is far from being the ca&s;e. Let it however re|joice us, if God may &s;ay, "There are &s;uch and &s;uch families, di&s;tingui&s;hable from tho&s;e in the neighborhood on this account; as prevalent as the neglect of <HI>family prayer</HI> is, they have the re&s;olution to practi&s;e it, and like my &s;ervant <HI>Daniel</HI> fear not the reproach and contempt which profane and ungodly men may ca&s;t up|on them, if they may but honor me and en|gage my favor, <HI>I know them; I h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">arken and hear, and a book of remembrance is written before me for them that fear me, and think on my name.</HI>" Nor &s;hould you urge,</P>
<P N="3">3. "That you have <HI>&s;o much bu&s;ine&s;s of anoth|er kind,</HI> as not to be able to attend to this."</P>
<P>I might cut the objection &s;hort at once, by applying to your con&s;cience, whether you have not time for many other things which you know to be of le&s;s importance. How many hours
<PB N="26" REF="037329_0025_100CB96454897DF8">in a week do you find for amu&s;ement, while you have none for devotion in your family? And do you indeed hold the ble&s;&s;ing of God &s;o very cheap, and think it a matter of &s;o little importance, that you conclude your bu&s;ine&s;s mu&s;t &s;ucceed the wor&s;e, if a few minutes were daily taken &s;olemnly to &s;eek it together? Let me rather admoni&s;h you, that the greater your bu&s;ine&s;s is, the more need you have to pray earne&s;tly, that your hearts may not be engro&s;&s;|ed by it. And I would beg leave further to re|mind you, that if your hurry of bu&s;ine&s;s were indeed &s;o great as the objection &s;uppo&s;es (which I believe is &s;eldom the ca&s;e) prudence alone might &s;ugge&s;t, that you &s;hould endeavor to contract it. For there are certain boundaries, beyond which a wi&s;e and faithful care cannot extend; and as an attempt to go beyond the&s;e boundaries has generally its foundation in av|arice, it often has its ends in poverty and ruin. But if you were ever &s;o &s;ecure of &s;ucceeding for this world, how dear might you and your children pay for that &s;ucce&s;s, if all the ble&s;&s;ed con&s;equences of <HI>family religion,</HI> for time and for eternity, were to be given up as the price of that very &s;mall part of your gains, which is owing to the minutes you take from the&s;e ex|erci&s;es, that you may give them to the world? For you plainly perceive the que&s;tion is only about <HI>them,</HI> and by no means about a &s;trenu|ous application to the proper duties of your &s;ecular calling through the day. And if you
<PB N="27" REF="037329_0026_100CB965EEBB0340"><HI>will be rich</HI> upon &s;uch <HI>profane terms,</HI> as are here &s;uppo&s;ed (for truly I can call them no better than profane) you will probably <HI>plunge your&s;elf into</HI> final <HI>perdition,</HI> and may in the mean time <HI>pierce your&s;elf through with many &s;orrows;</HI> while religious families learn by ble&s;&s;ed experi|ence, that <HI>the ble&s;&s;ing of the Lord,</HI> which they are &s;o often imploring together <HI>maketh rich, and addeth no &s;orrow with it;</HI> or that <HI>a little with the fear of the Lord is better than great trea&s;ure, with</HI> that intermingled <HI>trouble,</HI> which in the neglect of God mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be expected.

<P N="4">4. "That they <HI>want ability</HI> for a work of this kind."</P>
<P>To this I mu&s;t in the fir&s;t place reply, that where the hearts is rightly di&s;po&s;ed, it does not require any <HI>uncommon abilities,</HI> to di&s;charge <HI>family wor&s;hip</HI> in a decent and edifying ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">|ner. <HI>The heart of a wi&s;e man</HI> and good <HI>man</HI> i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> this re&s;pect <HI>teacheth his mouth, and addeth knowl|edge to his lips;</HI> and <HI>out of the fulne&s;s of it,</HI> when it is indeed full of pious affections, <HI>the mouth will</HI> naturally <HI>&s;peak.</HI> And if it &s;peak natural|ly, and in the man properly, it is enough.&mdash; There is no need at all of &s;peaking elegantly. The plaine&s;t and &s;imple&s;t language, in addre&s;&s;|es to the Maje&s;ty of heaven, appears to me far preferable to labored, pompous and artificial expre&s;&s;ions. Plain &s;hort &s;entences, uttered ju&s;t as they ri&s;e in the mind, will be be&s;t under|&s;tood by them that join with you. And it
<PB N="28" REF="037329_0027_100CB968D21F1190">&s;hould on &s;uch occa&s;ions be our endeavor, to <HI>let our&s;elves down,</HI> as much as po&s;&s;ible, to the under&s;tanding of the lea&s;t and meane&s;t of them. And this will in it&s;elf be more plea&s;|ing to God, than any thing which &s;hould pro|ceed from o&s;tentation and parade.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t al&s;o de&s;ire you to con&s;ider, how ma|ny <HI>Helps</HI> you may ea&s;ily procure. The <HI>Scrip|ture</HI> is a large and noble magazine of the mo&s;t proper &s;entiments, and mo&s;t expre&s;&s;ive lan|guage; which, if your will attend to with a be|coming regard, will &s;oon <HI>furni&s;h you for every good word and work,</HI> and mo&s;t apparently for this. And be&s;ides this, we have in our lan|guage a great variety of excellent <HI>forms of pray|er,</HI> for families as well as for private per&s;ons; which you may u&s;e, at lea&s;t at fir&s;t, with great profit. And if it be too laborious to you to learn them by heart, or if having learnt them you dare not tru&s;t your memory, what &s;hould forbid your <HI>reading them</HI> reverently and de|voutly? I hope I &s;hall give no offence to any good chri&s;tian by &s;aying, but on this occa&s;ion I &s;hould offend my con&s;cience by not &s;aying, that I have long thought an irreconcilable a|ver&s;ion to <HI>forms of prayer,</HI> even of human com|po&s;ition, as vain a &s;uper&s;tition, as a pa&s;&s;ionate attachment to them. And if any had rather, that a family &s;hould be prayerle&s;s, than that a well cho&s;en form &s;hould be gravely and &s;ol|emnly read in it, I think he judges as ab&s;urd|ly, as if he would rather &s;ee them &s;tarving to
<PB N="29" REF="037329_0028_100CB96B04D27388">death, than fed out of a di&s;h who&s;e materials or &s;hape are di&s;agreeable to him. The main thing is, that God be reverently and &s;incerely adored, that &s;uitable ble&s;&s;ings, temporal and &s;piritual, be &s;ought from him for our&s;elves and others, and cordial thank&s;givings returned to him for the various gifts of his continual boun|ty; And if this be done, the circum&s;tances of doing it, though I cannot think them quite in|different, are comparatively of &s;mall import|ance. I know by &s;ure experience, in a great variety of in&s;tances, that it is very po&s;&s;ible for chri&s;tians of no extraordinary genius, and with a very low education, to acquit them|&s;elves honorably in prayer without the a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance of <HI>forms:</HI> And they who at fir&s;t need them may, and probably, if they &s;eriou&s;ly &s;et about it would &s;oon outgrow that need. But if they did not, God might be glorified, and families edified, by the continued u&s;e of &s;uch helps. And on the whole, if it be indeed come to this, that you would rather &s;acrifice all the benefits of <HI>family-prayer,</HI> than &s;ubmit to the trouble of reading, or appointing another to read, a well compo&s;ed addre&s;s, which perhaps, with a &s;mall portion of &s;cripture before it might not take up one quarter of an hour's time, indeed, you mu&s;t be condemned by God, and your own con&s;cience. In &s;uch a view both mu&s;t te&s;tify, that it is neither want of lei&s;ure, nor want of ability, that prevents your di&s;|charging your duty, but a &s;tupid indifference a|bout
<PB N="30" REF="037329_0029_100CB96D2EF54938">it, or rather a wretched aver&s;ion to it; the natural con&s;equence of which might, if a little reflected upon, be &s;ufficient to throw the mo&s;t carele&s;s and arrogant &s;inner into an aw|ful alarm, if not a trembling con&s;ternation.</P>
<P>I apprehend, that the mo&s;t plau&s;ible objec|tions have now been canva&s;&s;ed; for I &s;uppo&s;e, few will be &s;o weak and cowardly as to plead,</P>

<P>But as it may be &s;ecretly thought of, where it would not be pleaded, e&s;pecially where the&s;e duties have unhappily been omitted when fam|ilies were fir&s;t formed, and in their mo&s;t flexi|ble and pliant &s;tate, I will be&s;tow a few words on this head.</P>
<P>And here I mu&s;t de&s;ire, that you would not ra&s;hly conclude this to be the ca&s;e, with re&s;|pect to your own. Do you think &s;o unkindly of your dome&s;tics, if they be not extremely wicked indeed, as to imagine they would be &s;e|cretly di&s;contented with &s;pending a little time daily in hearing the word of God, and being pre&s;ent at your dome&s;tic devotion; much le&s;s &s;hould you allow your&s;elf to think, till it ap|pears in fact, that they will have the arrogance openly to di&s;pute &s;o rea&s;onable a determination as this. Perhaps on the contrary, they are even now &s;ecretly wi&s;hing that God would put it into your heart to make the attempt; and thinking with a kind of tender regret, "Why are we denied &s;uch a ble&s;&s;ing, when
<PB N="31" REF="037329_0030_100CB96F67152080">the members of this and that family in the neighborhood are favored with it?"</P>
<P>But if it be indeed as you &s;uppo&s;e, that they would think of it with a &s;ecret aver&s;ion and come into it with apparent reluctance, if they can be induced to come into it at all; you would do well to reflect, whether this profane|ne&s;s and perver&s;ene&s;s may not in a great mea&s;|ure at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">, be owing to that very neglect which I am now pre&s;&s;ing you to reform? Which if it be, it ought certainly to convince you in the mo&s;t powerful and effectual man|ner, of the nece&s;&s;ity of endeavoring to repair as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible the mi&s;chief already done. And if there be really an <HI>oppo&s;ition,</HI> you ought to let any in whom you di&s;cover it, know, that your mea&s;ures are fixed, and that you <HI>cannot</HI> and <HI>will not</HI> re&s;ign that ju&s;t authority, which the laws of God and man give you in your own hou&s;e, to the petulancy of their humor, or the impiety of their unhappy temper.&mdash; Make the trial whether they will dare to break with you, rather than &s;ubmit to &s;o ea&s;y a con|dition, as that of being pre&s;ent at your hours of family wor&s;hip. If it be a <HI>&s;ervant</HI> that di&s;|putes it, you will no doubt think it a great ble&s;&s;ing to your family to rid it of &s;o dete&s;ta|ble a member, in that relation. And if it be a <HI>child,</HI> grown up to years that &s;hould be years of di&s;cretion, that &s;ets him&s;elf again&s;t this re|formation (and it is not po&s;&s;ible that any oth|ers &s;hould oppo&s;e you) though it is certain, that
<PB N="32" REF="037329_0031_100CB9724B6E4500">&s;uch a <HI>&s;on of Belial</HI> be, he mu&s;t be a great grief to your heart, you will be delivered from a great deal of di&s;tre&s;s which the &s;ight of his wickedne&s;s mu&s;t daily give you, by refu&s;ing him a place in your own family, which he would only di&s;grace and corrupt, and leaving him to practi&s;e tho&s;e irregularities and &s;candals which always go along with &s;uch a pre&s;umptu|ous contempt of religion, any where el&s;e than under your own roof.</P>
<P>I can think of but one objection more, and that is,</P>
<P N="6">6. "That you may not know <HI>how to intro|duce</HI> a practice which you have &s;o long neg|lected."</P>
<P>But this is an objection &s;o very &s;oon remov|ed, that I hope if nothing el&s;e lie in the way, your family will not continue another week in the unhappy circum&s;tances in which your neg|ligence has hitherto kept it. I were unworthy the name of a mini&s;ter of the go&s;pel, if, what|ever my other engagements are, I were not wil|ling to give you my utmo&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;tance, as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, in &s;o good a work as the reforma|tion of this great and lamentable evil. Far from thinking it a trouble to vi&s;it you and &s;pend an hour with you on &s;uch an occa&s;ion; who would not e&s;teem it a refre&s;hment, and a ble&s;&s;ing, to come and inform your dome&s;tics, when gathered together for this purpo&s;e, how wi&s;e and happy a re&s;olution you had taken, to repre&s;ent the rea&s;on they have to rejoice in it,
<PB N="33" REF="037329_0032_100CB97475036170">and to ble&s;s God who had in&s;pired you with it? And how &s;weet a work would it be to per|form it, as for the fir&s;t time imploring the ble&s;&s;ings of Providence and grace on you and yours, and intreating tho&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;tances of his holy Spirit, which may qualify you more abun|dantly for di&s;charging your peculiar part in it, and may render it the &s;ucce&s;sful means of planting, or of &s;upporting and animating a principle of true religion in every &s;oul under your care? Nor would the joy and delight be confined, to the minutes &s;pent with you at &s;uch a &s;ea&s;on: It would be carried home to the &s;tudy, and to the hou&s;e of God: And the very remembrance of it would for years to come, encourage to other attempts of u&s;eful|ne&s;s, and &s;trengthen our hands in the work of the Lord.</P>
<P>And oh my dear friend, whoever you are, be not a&s;hamed, that a mini&s;ter &s;hould on this occa&s;ion tell your children and &s;ervants, that you are &s;en&s;ible of your former neglect, and are determined in the &s;trength of God to prac|ti&s;e a duty, which it has indeed been criminal hitherto to omit. This is a mean and unwor|thy &s;hame, and would prevent our reforming evils which are indeed &s;hameful. It will be a glory to you, to be willing and &s;olicitous to re|vive langui&s;hing religion; a glory to give to other families an example which, if they have the wi&s;dom and courage to follow it, will un|doubtedly bring them down a rich variety of
<PB N="34" REF="037329_0033_100CB975F900ED10">ble&s;&s;ings on them&s;elves, and if followed by con&s;iderable numbers, on the public. At lea&s;t, it will be an honor to you in the &s;ight of men, and what is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> more, in the &s;ight of God, to have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> the generous effort; and not to make the guilty neglect of former years, an excu&s;e for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> to neglect, what it rather <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> argument imme|diately to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word">.</P>

You may then proceed to read a portion of &s;crip|ture and to pray with them in &s;uch a manner as you may think mo&s;t expedient. But in whatever manner it be done, you will remem|ber, that it mu&s;t be with reverence and &s;olem|nity, and with unfeigned fervour of devotion, as in the &s;ight of the heart-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ouching God.&mdash; And you will remember, that when once in|troduced, it mu&s;t be re&s;olutely and con&s;tantly carried on; for to ca&s;t out this heavenly gue&s;t, will in &s;ome degree be more &s;hameful, than
<PB N="35" REF="037329_0034_100CB977846E4318">not to admit it. But I hope, &s;weet experience of the plea&s;ure of the&s;e duties will be in&s;tead of a thou&s;and arguments, to engage your ad|herence to them. May God give you re&s;olu|tion <HI>immediately</HI> to make the attempt! and may he a&s;&s;i&s;t and accept you, and &s;catter down every de&s;irable ble&s;&s;ing of providence and of grace, on you and yours! <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <HI>this day</HI> (for I hope it will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> very day) may become memorable in your lives, as a &s;ea&s;on from whence you may dare a pro&s;perity and a joy hitherto unknown, how happy lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ver you may have been in former years: For very im|perfect, I am &s;ure, mu&s;t that dome&s;tic happi|ne&s;s be, in which dome&s;tic religion has no part.</P>
