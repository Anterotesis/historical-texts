<HEAD>APOLOGY FOR THE WORK.</HEAD>
<P>THE following treati&s;e was written at the de&s;ire of Mi&s;s S. and Mi&s;s M. Par|ker; who were them&s;elves educated for the purpo&s;e of educating others; and on that account were originally placed in dif|ferent &s;eminaries for female tuition; and afterwards engaged them&s;elves for a time as teachers in other &s;chools, and in private families; the better to qualify them&s;elves for the arduous ta&s;k of conducting a board|ing &s;chool for the education of young ladies.</P>
<P><PB REF="033601_0007_0FF7A15125B93230">
About four years ago a hou&s;e was offer|ed for &s;ale at A&s;hborne in Derby&s;hire, at the very extremity of the town, in a mo&s;t plea&s;ant and healthy &s;ituation, on a dry &s;andy &s;oil, with excellent water, well &s;hel|tered from the north-ea&s;t, and command|ing an exten&s;ive pro&s;pect of Sir Brooke Boothby's park, and its beautiful environs.</P>
<P>A &s;pacious walled garden adjoins the hou&s;e, at the bottom of which is a &s;tream of water, which may &s;ometime be convert|ed into a river-bath.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s PARKERS procured this eligible &s;ituation, and had the hou&s;e well fitted up for the purpo&s;es of a boarding &s;chool. It con&s;i&s;ts of an ample &s;chool-room, and an ample dining-room, and four &s;maller par|lours,
<PB REF="033601_0008_0FF7A15397C32910">on the principal floor; with two &s;tair-ca&s;es, one of which is of &s;tone. The whole is airy and well lighted; and now contains about thirty pupils without being crowded.</P>
<P>They next had the good fortune to en|gage very excellent teachers in dancing, mu&s;ic, and drawing, from Nottingham, Derby, &amp;c. with a polite emigrant as French ma&s;ter; and la&s;tly applied to me for any ideas, I could furni&s;h them with, on the &s;ubject of female education. And now, as their e&s;tabli&s;hment has &s;ucceeded to their utmo&s;t wi&s;h, have expre&s;&s;ed a de&s;ire, that I would give to the public, what I wrote originally for their private in&s;pec|tion.</P>
<P><PB REF="033601_0009_0FF7A1552F21C3F0">
I have only to add, that a copy of the manu&s;cript has been &s;een by many of the ingenious of both &s;exes, and much improv|ed by their ob&s;ervations; to whom I here beg leave to return my mo&s;t grateful ac|knowledgments.</P>

<HEAD><HI>A PLAN</HI> FOR THE CONDUCT OF FEMALE EDUCATION.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="section">
<HEAD>SECTION I. THE FEMALE CHARACTER.</HEAD>
<P>THE PARENTS and guardians of young ladies of the la&s;t half century were le&s;s &s;olicitous about procuring for them &s;o exten&s;ive an education, as modern refine|ment requires. Hence it happens, that female education has not yet been reduced to a perfect &s;y&s;tem; but is frequently di|rected by tho&s;e, who have not them&s;elves had a good education, or who have not &s;tu|died the &s;ubject with &s;ufficient attention. And tho' many ingenious remarks are to be
<PB N="10" REF="033601_0011_0FF7A15B26BB0A00">found in the works of Locke, Rou&s;&s;eau, Genlis, and other writers &s;till more mo|dern; yet few of them are exactly appli|cable to the management of boarding &s;chools; the improvement of which is the intent of the pre&s;ent treati&s;e.</P>
<P>The advantages of a good education con&s;i&s;t in uniting health and agility of bo|dy with cheerfulne&s;s and activity of mind; in &s;uperadding graceful movements to the former, and agreeable ta&s;tes to the latter; and in the acquirement of the rudiments of &s;uch arts and &s;ciences, as may amu&s;e our|&s;elves, or gain us the e&s;teem of others; with a &s;trict attention to the culture of mo|rality and religion.</P>
<P>The female character &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s the mild and retiring virtues rather than the bold and dazzling ones; great eminence in almo&s;t any thing is &s;ometimes injurious to a young lady; who&s;e temper and di&s;po&s;i|tion &s;hould appear to be pliant rather than
<PB N="11" REF="033601_0012_0FF7A15CB4BD4FF0">robu&s;t; to be ready to take impre&s;&s;ions ra|ther than to be decidedly marked; as great apparent &s;trength of character, however excellent, is liable to alarm both her own and the other &s;ex; and to create admira|tion rather than affection.</P>
<P>There are however &s;ituations in &s;ingle life; in which, after the completion of their &s;chool-education, ladies may culti|vate to any extent the fine arts or the &s;ci|ences for their amu&s;ement or in&s;truction. And there are &s;ituations in a married &s;tate; which may call forth all the energies of the mind in the care, education, or pro|vi&s;ion, for a family; which the inactivity, folly, or death of a hu&s;band may render ne|ce&s;&s;ary. Hence if to &s;oftne&s;s of manners, complacency of countenance, gentle un|hurried motion, with a voice clear and yet tender, the charms which enchant all hearts! can be &s;uperadded internal &s;trength and activity of mind, capable to tran&s;act the bu&s;ine&s;s or combat the evils of life;
<PB N="12" REF="033601_0013_0FF7A15E46B70268">with a due &s;en&s;e of moral and religious obligation; all is obtained, which education can &s;upply; the female character becomes complete, excites our love, and commands our admiration.</P>
<P>Education &s;hould draw the outline, and teach the u&s;e of the pencil; but the exertions of the individual mu&s;t afterwards introduce the various gradations of &s;hade and colour, mu&s;t illuminate the land&s;cape, and fill it with the beautiful figures of the Graces and the Virtues.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION II. MUSIC AND DANCING</HEAD>
<P>ARE generally taught by ma&s;ters, who profe&s;s tho&s;e arts; concerning which we &s;hall only ob&s;erve, that they are fre|quently believed to be of too great impor|tance in female education; and on that ac|count that too much time is expended on their acquirement. It is perhaps more de&s;irable, that young ladies &s;hould play, &s;ing, and dance, only &s;o well as to amu&s;e them&s;elves and their friends, than to prac|ti&s;e tho&s;e arts in &s;o eminent a degree as to a&s;toni&s;h the public; becau&s;e a great appa|rent attention to trivial accompli&s;hments is liable to give a &s;u&s;picion, that more va|luable acqui&s;itions have been neglected. And, as they con&s;i&s;t in an exhibition of the per&s;on, they are liable to be attended with vanity, and to extingui&s;h the blu&s;h of youthful timidity; which is in young ladies the mo&s;t powerful of their exterior charms.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="033601_0015_0FF7A163763F5FF8">
Such ma&s;ters &s;hould be cho&s;en to in|&s;truct young ladies in the&s;e accompli&s;h|ments, as are not only well qualified to &s;ing and play, or to dance them&s;elves; but al&s;o who can teach with good temper and genteel behaviour: they &s;hould recollect, that vulgar manners, with the &s;harp ge&s;|tures of anger, and its di&s;agreeable tones of voice, are unpardonable in tho&s;e, who profe&s;s to teach graceful motion, and me|lodious expre&s;&s;ion; and may affect the ta&s;te and temper of their pupils, &s;o as to be more injurious to their education; than any thing, which they are able to teach them, can counterbalance.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION III. READING.</HEAD>
<P>AS reading is as much a language to the eye, as &s;peaking is to the ear; it re|quires much time and labour for children to acquire both the&s;e languages. Such books &s;hould therefore be put into their hands, as join amu&s;ement with in&s;truction, and thus lighten the fatigue of continued application, as Sandford and Merton, Pa|rent's a&s;&s;i&s;tant, Evenings at home, and ma|ny others.</P>
<P>In learning to read aloud, a clear and di&s;tinct enunciation is &s;eldom acquired at &s;chools; which is owing to the child &s;tand|ing clo&s;e to the teacher, who looks over the book along with it; and hence the pupil finds no difficulty in being under&s;tood, even when &s;he pronounces only half words. This however is ea&s;ily remedied by placing the reader at the di&s;tance of
<PB N="16" REF="033601_0017_0FF7A167797580D0">two yards or more from the hearer; then the young &s;cholar &s;oon finds, that &s;he is not under&s;tood, unle&s;s &s;he expre&s;&s;es her|&s;elf with clear articulation. For this pur|po&s;e the teacher &s;hould always be provided with a duplicate of the book, &s;he teaches; that &s;he may not be nece&s;&s;itated to look over the &s;houlder of her pupil.</P>
<P>As the young &s;cholars advance in the knowledge of language, other books mu&s;t be taught them both in pro&s;e and poetry; &s;uch as may improve their minds in the knowledge of things, in morality, religion, or which may form their ta&s;te. A great number of books for the u&s;e of children has been publi&s;hed in late years; many of them by very ingenious writers, and well adapted to the purpo&s;e de&s;igned, of &s;uch of the&s;e, as have come to my knowledge, a catalogue &s;hall be given at the end of this treati&s;e.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION. IV. WRITING.</HEAD>
<P>WRITING, as it keeps the body in a fixed po&s;ture, as well as drawing, and needlework, &s;hould not be too long appli|ed to at a time; &s;ince the body, and even the countenance, may thus get a certain tendency to one attitude; as is &s;een in children, who are brought up to &s;ome me|chanic art, as in poli&s;hing buttons or pre|cious &s;tones on a lathe. A proper manner of holding the pen, or pencil, or needle, with an ea&s;y but graceful attitude of the per&s;on, and an agreeable moderate atten|tion of the countenance, &s;hould fir&s;t be taught; for which purpo&s;es an inclined de&s;k has many advantages over an horizon|tal table for the books, or working frames; as the body is thence le&s;s bent forwards; and the light in general &s;ituations more vi|vidly reflected to the eye.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="033601_0019_0FF7A16D8477B128">
If the de&s;k be &s;ixteen inches broad, the furthermo&s;t edge of it &s;hould ri&s;e about three inches and half from the horizontal line; which produces the mo&s;t convenient inclination, and the table or frame, which &s;upports it, for the u&s;e of the taller chil|dren, &s;hould ri&s;e about two feet eight inch|es from the ground.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION V. GRAMMAR,</HEAD>
<P>WHICH is an ab&s;tract &s;cience teaching the texture of language, is too hard for very young minds; and is there|fore generally taught too early: and the &s;ame may be &s;aid of Arithmetic. The Engli&s;h grammars in general u&s;e at &s;chools are both tedious and defective compo&s;i|tions; an epitome, or extract, from Lowth's grammar, with the late improvements of Mr. Horne Tooke in the theory of lan|guage, would well &s;upply this branch of knowledge; and might be given to the public under the name of a "rational Engli&s;h grammar."</P>
<P>Mrs. Devis has publi&s;hed a &s;mall and u&s;eful rudiment of grammar purpo&s;ely for the u&s;e of young ladies: which may be taught as an introduction to Lowth's grammar. The Abbe Gaultier's Jeu de
<PB N="20" REF="033601_0021_0FF7A170A057BD48">Grammaire may perhaps be rendered a|mu&s;ing to children, and convey to them ideas of the French grammar.</P>

<DIV2 N="6" TYPE="section">
<PB REF="033601_0022_0FF7A1740B489490">
<HEAD>SECTION VI. LANGUAGES.</HEAD>
<P>THE nece&s;&s;ity of learning &s;ome an|tient or foreign languages impo&s;es a labori|ous ta&s;k on the youth of both &s;exes; which con&s;umes years of their precious time, which might otherwi&s;e be employed in the acqui&s;ition of &s;ciences. The difficulty of obtaining a competent knowledge of the Greek or Latin language is many times greater than that of obtaining any modern one; as may be deduced from the innu|merable changes of the termination of their nouns, adjectives, and verbs; which to a beginner are all &s;o many new words. And as the works of the be&s;t writers in the&s;e languages have been tran&s;lated into our own, it is le&s;s nece&s;&s;ary in the education of ladies to expend &s;o much time and la|bour in acquiring them. But as the French and Italian are le&s;s difficult to learn, and contain new books of ta&s;te and knowledge,
<PB N="22" REF="033601_0023_0FF7A175983693F0">which are yearly publi&s;hed in this age of literature; and as they are convenient for conver&s;ing with foreigners, who come hither, or in our travelling into other countries; and la&s;tly, as they are agree|able as well as fa&s;hionable &s;tudies; the pupils of boarding &s;chools &s;hould be en|couraged to attain one or both of them.</P>
<P>The method recommended by Mr. Locke in his treati&s;e on education, &s;ect. 162, of teaching languages by conver&s;a|tion, will on trial be generally found &s;uc|ce&s;sful in re&s;pect to modern languages with even the younge&s;t children. Never|thele&s;s a knowledge of grammar &s;hould afterwards be taught with care, if the child be too young at fir&s;t to attend to it; for without the aid of grammar not only the French or Italian languages, but even the Engli&s;h will not always be &s;poken or writ|ten with perfect accuracy.</P>
<P>For this purpo&s;e of acquiring modern languages by conver&s;ation, a &s;chool gene|rally
<PB N="23" REF="033601_0024_0FF7A178140A2850">&s;upplies better opportunities than a private family, be&s;ides the advantage of &s;ome degree of emulation, which frequent|ly exi&s;ts, where children conver&s;e to|gether: another advantage of infantine &s;o|ciety is, that they learn many other things, as well as languages, by repeating them to each other; and obtain, what is &s;eldom to be acquired from adult companions, &s;ome knowledge of phy&s;iognomy; as the pa&s;&s;ions of children are more legibly expre&s;&s;ed on their countenances than at a maturer age. This knowledge of phy&s;iognomy, which is perhaps only to be acquired at &s;chools, by giving a promptitude of under&s;tanding the pre&s;ent approbation or di&s;like, and the good or bad de&s;igns, of tho&s;e whom we con|ver&s;e with, becomes of hourly u&s;e in al|mo&s;t every department of life.</P>

<PB REF="033601_0025_0FF7A179A682CF78">
<HEAD>SECTION VII. ARITHMETIC</HEAD>
<P>LIKE grammar is an ab&s;tract &s;cience, which is frequently attempted to be taught too early; at the &s;ame time it may be ob|&s;erved, that the early initiation of mo&s;t children into card playing before they come to &s;chool, by giving clear and vi&s;ible ideas of the ten fir&s;t numerals, &s;eems greatly to facilitate their acquirement of arithmetic; and if this fa&s;hionable amu&s;ement could be &s;o managed by the parents, who allow it to their children, as not to excite a de&s;ire of gain along with a conte&s;t of ingenuity, it might be rendered, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, ad|vantageous by exciting the mind to activi|ty in this branch of &s;cience; but in never|thele&s;s not proper to be u&s;ed in &s;chools, where its effects on the pa&s;&s;ions cannot be &s;ufficiently watched, and counteracted.</P>
<P>So much of the &s;cience of numbers as is in common u&s;e, as the numeration, &s;ub|traction,
<PB N="25" REF="033601_0026_0FF7A17B4240F338">multiplication, and divi&s;ion of money, &s;hould be learnt with accuracy; to which &s;hould be added the rule of three, and decimal fractions; which will abun|dantly repay the labour of acquiring them by the plea&s;ure and utility, which will per|petually re&s;ult from the knowledge of them thro' life. The higher parts of arithme|tic, as algebra and fluxions, belong to the ab&s;tru&s;er &s;ciences.</P>
<P>There are many introductory books to the &s;cience of arithmetic; tho&s;e I have heard mo&s;t recommended are Vi&s;e's tutor's guide, Hutton's practical arithmetic, and Wingate's arithmetic; but it is probable, that mo&s;t of the introductory treati&s;es to a|rithmetic mu&s;t be nearly of equal excel|lence.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION VIII. GEOGRAPHY.</HEAD>
<P>SO much of this &s;cience, as depends only on memory, may be taught to chil|dren in their early years. They &s;hould be taught to point out on large maps the counties of England, and then the prin|cipal divi&s;ions of Europe, and of the other quarters of the world; and la&s;tly to trace out the principal rivers and mountains, which ingrave or imbo&s;s its &s;urface, which is much to be preferred to di&s;&s;ected maps; as it is the &s;ituations, rather than the exact forms of counties and of countries, which &s;hould be attended to. Afterwards the u&s;e of the globes &s;hould be explained; and &s;ome &s;hort outline of a&s;tronomy ought to accompany the&s;e lectures.</P>
<P>A compendious &s;y&s;tem of geography on cards, publi&s;hed by Mr. Newberry, in St. Paul's church yard, &s;upplies a very con|venient
<PB N="27" REF="033601_0028_0FF7A181413F6988">method of in&s;tructing children. Other geographical cards by Bowles, tho' they only mention the latitude and longi|tude of important places, may al&s;o be u&s;ed with advantage. The maps, publi&s;hed by Mr. Faden, which have blank outlines to be filled up by the &s;tudent, are well de|&s;igned, and not very expen&s;ive. The Ab|be Gaultier's cours de Geographie formed into a game may, like his game at gram|mar, be rendered amu&s;ing to children, and are tolerably well adapted both to pri|vate families, where there are but few pu|pils, and to public &s;eminaries of in|&s;truction.</P>
<P>Fairman's geography, a &s;mall octavo &s;old by John&s;on, contains a &s;hort account of the planets, and u&s;e of the globes. Brooks' gazetteer is an u&s;eful work; and &s;ome other good geographical publications are mentioned in the catalogue of books at the end of this work.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION IX. HISTORY.</HEAD>
<P>THE hi&s;tory of mankind is connect|ed with the knowledge of the earth, which they cultivate. A &s;ummary of the hi&s;tory of England &s;hould precede that of other nations, as it may be more intere&s;ting, and more ea&s;ily comprehended by Engli&s;h children. Afterwards an abridgment of the hi&s;tory of other nations both antient and modern may be collected from various writers, but are &s;ome of them already made conci&s;e and agreeable by Dr. Gold&s;mith in his hi&s;tories of Greece and Rome, as well as of England and Scotland; which how|ever cannot be well remembered without a previous knowledge of geography, or by con&s;ulting maps with every change of place in the account of tran&s;actions.</P>

This out|line of hi&s;tory and chronology may be rea|dily and agreeably learned from Prie&s;tley's chart of hi&s;tory; which with his chart of biography &s;hould hang among&s;t a collec|tion of large well-coloured maps in the parlour of a boarding &s;chool, that they may frequently encounter the eyes of the young &s;tudents.</P>

<P>THE hi&s;tory of the various other animals is al&s;o connected with our know|ledge of the various parts of the earth, which they inhabit. This is termed na|tural hi&s;tory, and may be taught to chil|dren earlier than the hi&s;tories of mankind, as being ea&s;ier to their comprehen&s;ions, and thence more intere&s;ting and agreeable to them. Dr. Gold&s;mith in his hi&s;tory of animated nature has al&s;o made this part of knowledge of ea&s;y acce&s;s; and Mr. Bew|ick's account of quadrupedes, with wood|prints of the animals, and amu&s;ing tale|pieces to the &s;ections, are quite charming to children.

<HEAD>SECTION XI. THE RUDIMENTS OF TASTE</HEAD>
<P>ARE too much neglected in mo&s;t boarding &s;chools; the&s;e &s;hould be taught with &s;ome care, as perhaps peculiarly be|longing to Ladies; &s;ince ta&s;te enters into their dre&s;s, their motions, their manners, as well as into all the fine arts, which they have lei&s;ure to cultivate: as drawing, paint|ing, modelling, making artificial flowers, embroidery; writing letters, reading, &s;peak|ing, and into almo&s;t every circum&s;tance of life.</P>
<P>The general rudiments of ta&s;te are to be acquired fir&s;t by reading books, which treat profe&s;&s;edly on the &s;ubject; as the ten papers by Mr. Addi&s;on on the power of imagination in the Spectator, vol. 6, No. 411; Akin&s;ide's plea&s;ures of imagination; Burke on the &s;ublime and beautiful; Ho|garth's analy&s;is of beauty; Ma&s;on's Engli&s;h
<PB N="33" REF="033601_0034_0FF7A18EC8467438">garden; Wheatley's ornamental garden|ing; and Gilpin's picture&s;que views. Se|condly by &s;electing and explaining admir|ed pa&s;&s;ages from cla&s;&s;ical authors, as the Beauties of Shake&s;peare, of John&s;on, and of Sterne. And la&s;tly, by exhibiting and explaining the prints of beautiful objects, or ca&s;ts of the be&s;t antique gems and me|dallions.</P>
<P>The authors above mentioned have di|vided the objects of Ta&s;te into the &s;ub|lime, the beautiful, and the new; but a new &s;ect of inquirers into this &s;ubject have lately added the Picture&s;que; which is &s;uppo&s;ed to differ from the beautiful by its want of &s;moothne&s;s, and from the &s;ublime from its want of &s;ize; but this circum&s;tance has not yet perhaps undergone &s;ufficient examination.&mdash;See e&s;&s;ay on Picture&s;que, by U. Price.</P>
<P>Others have endeavoured to make a di&s;tinction between beauty and grace; and
<PB N="34" REF="033601_0035_0FF7A19142393E90">have e&s;teemed them, as it were, rivals for the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the human heart. But Grace may be defined Beauty in action; for a &s;leeping beauty can not be called graceful, in whatever attitude &s;he may re|cline; the mu&s;cles mu&s;t be in action to pro|duce a graceful attitude, and the limbs to produce a graceful motion. The &s;uppo&s;|ed origin of our ideas of beauty acquired in our early infancy from the curved lines, which form the female bo&s;om, is deliver|ed in Zoonomia, vol. I. &s;ect. xvi. 6; but is too metaphy&s;ical an inve&s;tigation for young ladies.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION XII. DRAWING AND EMBROIDERY.</HEAD>
<P>DRAWING as an elegant art be|longs to the education of young ladies, and greatly facilitates the acquirement of Ta&s;te. As this is generally taught by ma&s;ters, who profe&s;s it, I &s;hall only ob&s;erve, that tho' as an art it con&s;i&s;ts of deceiving the eye, yet as a &s;cience it is capable of producing to the mind the mo&s;t &s;ublime and beautiful images, or the mo&s;t intere&s;ting &s;cenes of life, for our amu&s;ement, admiration, or in|&s;truction.</P>
<P>The &s;ame ob&s;ervation applies to Em|broidery, which is painting with the needle in&s;tead of the pencil, and &s;eems to have been a fa&s;hionable employment of ladies of the highe&s;t rank in the early ages of the world. As the ladies in polite life have frequently much lei&s;ure time at their di&s;|po&s;al, it is wi&s;e for them to learn many
<PB N="36" REF="033601_0037_0FF7A1954CF7BF78">elegant as well as u&s;eful arts in their early years; which they may afterward cultivate for their amu&s;ement; and thus deprive &s;olitude of irk&s;omene&s;s: And by being able to entertain them&s;elves, they may be le&s;s &s;olicitous to enter the circles of di&s;&s;i|pation, and depend le&s;s for happine&s;s on the caprice of others.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the amu&s;ement or accompli&s;h|ment of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the talent of drawing, there is another advantage re&s;ulting from it; which con&s;i&s;ts in u&s;ing the pencil as a language to expre&s;s the forms of all vi&s;ible objects, as of flowers, machines, hou&s;es, land&s;capes; which can not in words alone be conveyed to others with &s;ufficient accu|racy: For this end it may be &s;ufficient to draw in outlines alone the figures of na|tural things, without expending &s;o much time on this art, as is requi&s;ite to enable the learner to add the nice touches, which form the delicate gradations of &s;hade and colour.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="033601_0038_0FF7A197C7F54310">
It may be &s;uppo&s;ed, that &s;ome know|ledge of the &s;cience of per&s;pective &s;hould be previou&s;ly acquired for the purpo&s;e of drawing the outlines of objects; but I &s;u&s;|pect, that this is not always nece&s;&s;ary, &s;ince at our learning to &s;ee; before we have compared the ideas received by the &s;en&s;e of &s;ight with tho&s;e received by that of touch; any object placed before our eyes, as &s;uppo&s;e the face of a companion, mu&s;t appear a flat coloured or &s;haded &s;urface, and not a &s;olid &s;ub&s;tance covered with emi|nences and depre&s;&s;ions; as is &s;o well proved by Bi&s;hop Berkley in his theory of vi&s;ion. Hence if any one could &s;o far unlearn the language of &s;ight as to imagine the face of his companion to be a flat co|loured &s;urface only, (as it is really &s;een) he would draw from nature as ea&s;ily and exactly, as if he was copying a picture, as the inequalities would appear lights and &s;hades; and he would thus be enabled to take the likene&s;s with much greater facili|ty and accuracy without the aid of the rules of per&s;pective.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION XIII. THE HEATHEN MYTHOLOGY</HEAD>
<P>IS connected with the &s;tudy of ta&s;te, and &s;hould therefore be taught in boarding &s;chools; as without &s;ome knowledge of it the works of the painters, &s;tatuari&s;ts, and poets, both antient and modern, can not be under&s;tood. But as a great part of this mythology con&s;i&s;ts of per&s;onified vices, much care &s;hould be taken in female &s;chools, as well as in male ones, to prevent any bad impre&s;&s;ions, which might be made on the mind by this kind of erudition; this is to be accompli&s;hed by explaining the allegorical meaning of many of the&s;e &s;uppo&s;ed actions of heathen deities, and by &s;hewing that they are at pre&s;ent u&s;ed only as emblems of certain powers, as Mi|nerva of wi&s;dom, and Bellona of war, and thus con&s;titute the language of painters; and are indeed almo&s;t the whole language which that art po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, be&s;ides the delinea|tion of vi&s;ible objects in re&s;t or in action.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="033601_0040_0FF7A19CE2250338">
The&s;e emblems however are not to be &s;o ea&s;ily acquired by de&s;criptions alone, nor &s;o ea&s;ily remembered by young pupils; as when prints of antique &s;tatues, or me|dallions, or when cameos, or impre&s;&s;ions of antique gems, are at the &s;ame time &s;hewn and explained to them. For this purpo&s;e the prints of Spence's Polymetis may be exhibited and explained; from which Bell's pantheon is principally ta|ken: And Dannet's dictionary of mytho|logy, originally written in French, may be occa&s;ionally con&s;ulted; and the notes on Mr. Pope's tran&s;lations of Homer.</P>
<P>There is al&s;o a little book intitled, "In&s;tructions &s;ur les Metamorpho&s;es, par M.

<HEAD>SECTION XIV. POLITE LITERATURE</HEAD>
<P>MAY be divided into di&s;&s;ertations, plays, romances, poems; each of which, if the works are properly &s;elected, may af|ford amu&s;ement and in&s;truction to young per&s;ons; of &s;ome of the books of each of the&s;e cla&s;&s;es of literature a catalogue will be given at the end of the work.</P>
<P>Such di&s;&s;ertations, as have been gene|rally admired, may be &s;elected from the Spectator, Tatler, Guardian, the World, the Rambler, Adventurer, Looker-on, be&s;ides many others.</P>
<P>Plays are of three kinds, tragical, &s;en|timental, and humourous; of the fir&s;t, Addi&s;on's Cato has been long admired; and the tragedies of Thomp&s;on con&s;i&s;t of fine language. Of the &s;econd kind Cumber|land's comedies are in&s;tances; and of the
<PB N="42" REF="033601_0043_0FF7A1A4B5B396D0">third Sheridan's comedies; &s;ome of which are entertaining and inoffen&s;ive, and may be read by young ladies without injury to their morals, or much outrage to their feelings.</P>
<P>There are many plays, which are bet|ter &s;een as exhibited on the &s;tage, than as read in the clo&s;et; becau&s;e the objectiona|ble pa&s;&s;ages are generally omitted in the repre&s;entation. But whether young la|dies &s;hould be taught to act plays them|&s;elves, as is done at &s;ome boy's &s;chools, is a matter of doubt. The danger con&s;i&s;ts in this, le&s;t the acqui&s;ition of bolder ac|tion, and a more elevated voice, &s;hould an|nihilate that retiring mode&s;ty, and blu&s;h|ing embarra&s;&s;ment, to which young ladies owe one of their mo&s;t powerful external charms.</P>
<P>If young ladies act plays among&s;t them|&s;elves only, or without admitting more than two or three of their friends or pa|rents;
<PB N="43" REF="033601_0044_0FF7A1A647FB5D90">or if they repeat cho&s;en &s;cenes of plays, or &s;peeches only, much of the above objection cea&s;es, and &s;ome advantages may re&s;ult to their attitudes or enunciation. Madam de Genlis' Theatre d'Education affords the lea&s;t exceptionable whole plays, with the &s;acred dramas of Mi&s;s Moore, and of Meta&s;ta&s;io.</P>
<P N="3">3. Novels or romances may be divid|ed into the &s;erious, the humourous, and the amorous. Of the&s;e, the la&s;t &s;hould be intirely interdicted; but the fir&s;t, when well managed, may convey in&s;truction in the mo&s;t agreeable and forcible manner: Such as Mr. Day's Sandford and Merton. The Children's Friend. Tales of the Ca&s;|tle. Robin&s;on Cru&s;oe. Edward, by the author of Zelucco. And to the&s;e may be added &s;ome other modern novels, the pro|ductions of ingenious ladies, which are I believe le&s;s objectionable than many others; as the Evelina, Cecilia, and Ca|milla of Mi&s;s Burney. The Emmeline
<PB N="44" REF="033601_0045_0FF7A1A7D71489F0">and Ethelinda of Charlotte Smith; Inch|bald's &s;imple &s;tory; Mrs. Brook's Emily Montague; and the female Quixote; all which I have here introduced from the character given to me of them by a very ingenious lady; not having my&s;elf read them with &s;ufficient attention. And la&s;t|ly, the humorous novels, which are not written to inflame the pa&s;&s;ions, convey in|&s;truction, as far as they are imitations of real life: Of the&s;e are Le Sage's famous novel of Gil Blas; and Fielding's Tom Jones; neither of which however are pro|per books for young readers.</P>
<P>There are many, who condemn the u&s;e of novels altogether; but what are epic po|ems but novels in ver&s;e?&mdash;It is difficult to draw the line of limit between novels, and other works of imagination; unle&s;s the word novel be confined to mean only the romances of love and chivalry.</P>
<P>It is true indeed, that almo&s;t all novels, as well as plays, and epic poems, have &s;ome
<PB N="45" REF="033601_0046_0FF7A1AA5DC1AD00">exceptional pa&s;&s;ages to be found in them; which might therefore be expunged, be|fore they are allowed to be read by young ladies. But are young women therefore to be kept in intire ignorance of mankind, with whom they mu&s;t &s;hortly a&s;&s;ociate, and from whom they are frequently to choo&s;e a partner for life? This would be making them the &s;laves rather than the companions of men, like the Sultanas of a Turki&s;h Seraglio. And how can young women, who are &s;ecluded from the other &s;ex from their infancy, form any judgment of men, if they are not to be a&s;&s;i&s;ted by &s;uch books, as delineate manners?&mdash;A lady of fortune, who was per&s;uaded by her guar|dian to marry a di&s;agreeable and &s;elfi&s;h man, &s;peaking to her friend of the ill humour of her hu&s;band, lamented, that &s;he had been prohibited from reading novels. <Q>If I had read &s;uch books, &s;aid &s;he, before I was married, I &s;hould have cho&s;en bet|ter; I was told, that all men were alike except in re&s;pect to fortune.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="033601_0047_0FF7A1ACE0E19E28">
We mu&s;t however ob&s;erve, that novels are perhaps more objectionable in &s;chools than in private education; as the com|ments of one bad mind may be dangerous to the whole community: And as they are more amu&s;ing to young people than any other books, if read too early, they may give a di&s;ta&s;te to more u&s;eful knowledge; which are good rea&s;ons for the total prohi|bition of them in &s;chools: And in private education, le&s;t a preference of fiction to truth &s;hould be thus in&s;tilled, the ridicu|lous pa&s;&s;ages, with which even the be&s;t no|vels abound, &s;hould be carefully pointed out by a friend or governe&s;s: with their exaggerations, improbabilities, and fre|quent deviations from nature.</P>
<P>There are indeed few books, which delineate manners, whether in pro&s;e or poetry, however well cho&s;en, which have not &s;ome objectionable pa&s;&s;ages in them. In reading the fables of E&s;op, Mr. Rou&s;&s;eau well ob&s;erves, that the effect
<PB N="47" REF="033601_0048_0FF7A1AF774C4BB8">on the mind may frequently be totally dif|ferent from that de&s;igned by the author; as in the fable where the fox flatters the crow, and gains the piece of chee&s;e, the moral was de&s;igned to &s;hew the folly of at|tending to flatterers; but may equally be &s;uppo&s;ed to applaud the cunning of the fox or flatterer, who is rewarded. In the popular narrative of Robin&s;on Cru&s;oe a childi&s;h &s;uper&s;tition concerning intima|tions of future events, &s;omewhat like the &s;econd &s;ight of the highlands of Scotland, is frequently inculcated; and the u&s;e of rum or brandy is propo&s;ed as an infallible cure in all maladies; which however I am told is corrected in the new Robin&s;on Cru&s;oe.</P>
<P>Pamela, and Jo&s;eph Andrews, and Cla|ri&s;&s;a Harlow, are recommended by Ma|dame de Genlis, and by Mrs. Macawley.&mdash; Madame de Genlis in a note in one of her works gives her rea&s;on for recommending Richard&s;on's novels; becau&s;e his heroines
<PB N="48" REF="033601_0049_0FF7A1B10993EF50">retain a more con&s;iderable degree of com|mand over their affections than tho&s;e of apparently le&s;s exceptionable romances. In this re&s;pect a novel called "Plain Sen&s;e," lately publi&s;hed by Lane, and written by an ingenious Che&s;hire lady, claims the preference to all others, and ap|pears to me to carry this idea to exce&s;s.</P>
<P>The works of Richard&s;on are never|thele&s;s not only too voluminous, and thence would con&s;ume too much time, which might be better employed in &s;chools: but in the&s;e, and even in Mr. Pope's rape of the lock, and his Eloi&s;a to Abelard, many objectionable pa&s;&s;ages of another kind may be di&s;covered. If the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages, from which &s;o few books are totally exempt, were expunged, it might rai&s;e curio&s;ity, and induce young people to examine dif|ferent copies of the &s;ame work, and to &s;eek for other improper books them&s;elves; it is therefore perhaps better, when the&s;e books are read to a governe&s;s, that
<PB N="49" REF="033601_0050_0FF7A1B2B4BE6D18">&s;he &s;hould expre&s;s di&s;approbation in a plain and quiet way, of &s;uch pa&s;&s;ages, ra|ther than to expunge them; which would give a feeling of di&s;like to the pupil, and confirm her delicacy, rather than give im|purity to her ideas.</P>
<P>Much therefore depends on the con|duct of the governe&s;s in this re&s;pect, &s;o long as they are under the eye of a judi|cious monitor, no real harm could proba|bly ari&s;e from their &s;eeing human nature in all the cla&s;&s;es of life, not only as it &s;hould be, or as it may be imagined to be, but as it really exi&s;ts, &s;ince without compari&s;on there can be no judgment, and con&s;equent|ly no real knowledge.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t neverthele&s;s be ob&s;erved, that the exce&s;&s;ive &s;tudy of novels is univer&s;ally an ill employment at any time of life; not only becau&s;e &s;uch readers are liable to ac|quire a romantic ta&s;te; and to return from the flowery &s;cenes of fiction to the com|mon
<PB N="50" REF="033601_0051_0FF7A1B7552ADA90">duties of life with a degree of regret; but becau&s;e the high-wrought &s;cenes of elegant di&s;tre&s;s di&s;played in novels have been found to blunt the feelings of &s;uch readers towards real objects of mi&s;ery; which awaken only di&s;gu&s;t in their minds in&s;tead of &s;entiments of pity or benevo|lence.</P>
<P N="4">4. The works of the poets, as well as tho&s;e of the writers of novels, require to be &s;elected with great caution. The &s;ame may be &s;aid of painting, &s;culpture, and mu&s;ic; which by delighting the imagina|tion influence the judgment, and may thence be employed either to good or bad purpo&s;es: But as poetry, when thus &s;elect|ed, like painting, &s;culpture, and mu&s;ic, its rival &s;i&s;ters, is an object of refined ta&s;te, and affords an elegant amu&s;ement at lea&s;t, it &s;o far belongs to the education of young ladies.</P>
<P>Gay's fables, Thom&s;on's &s;ea&s;ons, Gi&s;|borne's walk in a fore&s;t, are proper for the
<PB N="51" REF="033601_0052_0FF7A1B8E6CC9A18">younger cla&s;&s;es of pupils; afterwards Pope's Ethic epi&s;tles, and e&s;&s;ay on man, Gold-&s;mith's poems, Akin&s;ide, Ma&s;on, Gray, and others, which are enumerated in the catalogue. I forbear to mention the Bo|tanic garden; as &s;ome ladies have intimat|ed to me, that the Loves of the plants are de&s;cribed in too glowing colours; but as the de&s;criptions are in general of female forms in graceful attitudes, the objection is le&s;s forcible in re&s;pect to female readers. And be&s;ides the celebrated poets of our own country, as Milton and Shake&s;peare, tran|&s;lations from the antients, as from Homer and Virgil; and from the more modern poems of Ta&s;&s;o, and Camoens, may be read with plea&s;ure and improvement, tho' &s;ome objectionable pa&s;&s;ages may perhaps be found in all of them.</P>
<P N="5">5. For the purpo&s;e of forming a &s;tyle in writing, a few well-cho&s;en books &s;hould be read often over; till the ear acquires, as it were, the mu&s;ick of the &s;entences;
<PB N="52" REF="033601_0053_0FF7A1BA89CB1098">and the imagination is thus enabled to co|py it in our own compo&s;itions; &s;uch as tho&s;e papers of the Spectator, which are a&s;cribed to Addi&s;on, and are terminated with a capital letter of the word Clio; or &s;ome of Lady Wortley Montague's letters from Turkey; or other works of cha&s;te, di&s;tinct, and expre&s;&s;ive &s;tyle, not overload|ed with metaphors, which with &s;uperabun|dance of ornament injure per&s;picuity.</P>
<P>But for other purpo&s;es of education it is perhaps better to teach young people &s;elect parts of many books, than a few en|tire ones; not only becau&s;e the pupils will thus be acquainted with more authors in fa&s;hionable literature; but becau&s;e the bu&s;ine&s;s of polite education is to give the outlines of many &s;pecies of erudition, or branches of knowledge; which the young ladies may cultivate further at their future lei&s;ure without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a teacher, as may be&s;t &s;uit their ta&s;tes or their &s;itua|tions.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="033601_0054_0FF7A1BD152ED618">
I cannot conclude this &s;ection on po|lite learning without mentioning, that &s;ome illiterate men have condemned the cultivation of the minds of the female &s;ex, and have called &s;uch in ridicule learned ladies; as if it was a reproach to render them&s;elves agreeable and u&s;eful. Where affectation is joined with learning, it be|comes pedantry, but this belongs oftener to the ignorant than to the cultivated; as is &s;o well elucidated in "Letters to literary ladies," a &s;mall duodecimo publi&s;hed by John&s;on, and written by one of the inge|nious family of E&mdash;in Ireland.</P>

The acquirement of Chemi&s;try &s;hould be preceded by a &s;ketch of Mineralogy; which is not only an intere&s;ting branch of &s;cience, as it teaches the knowledge of dia|monds and precious &s;tones, and of the va|rious mines of metals, coals, and &s;alt; but becau&s;e it explains al&s;o the difference of &s;oils, and is thus concerned in the theory and practice of agriculture: But there is at pre&s;ent no proper introductory book, that I know of, on this &s;ubject for the u&s;e of children; as Cron&s;tedt's and Bergman's, and Kirwan's mineralogy are too exact and prolix; nor could be well under&s;tood with|out a &s;mall collection of fo&s;&s;ils.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION XVII. COMPASSION.</HEAD>
<P>A SYMPATHY with the pains and plea&s;ures of others is the foundation of all our &s;ocial virtues. "DO AS YOU WOULD BE DONE BY," is a precept which de&s;cended from heaven. Whoever feels pain him|&s;elf, when he &s;ees others affected with it, will not only never be liable to give pain, but will always be inclined to relieve it. The lady, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es this chri&s;tian vir|tue of compa&s;&s;ion, cannot but be a good daughter, a good wife, and a good mother, that is, an amiable character in every de|partment of life.</P>
<P>The manner of communicating this benevolent &s;ympathy to children con&s;i&s;ts in expre&s;&s;ing our own &s;ympathy, when any thing cruel pre&s;ents it&s;elf; as in the de|&s;truction of an in&s;ect; or when actions of
<PB N="64" REF="033601_0065_0FF7A1D5E3D03680">cruelty are related in books or in conver&s;a|tion. I once ob&s;erved a lady with appa|rent expre&s;&s;ions of &s;ympathy &s;ay to her lit|tle daughter, who was pulling off the legs of a fly, <Q>how &s;hould you like to have your arms and legs pulled off? would it not give you great pain? pray let it fly away out of the window:</Q> which I doubt not would make an indelible impre&s;&s;ion on the child, and lay the foundation of an amiable character.</P>
<P>This virtue of compa&s;&s;ion is a certain foundation of benevolence; and on that account renders children good to their own parents in the latter part of their lives, as well as to all other people; an important circum&s;tance to the happine&s;s of our latter years! Where cruelty or malevolence re&s;ides in the brea&s;t, it is generally exerci&s;|ed mo&s;t by the child upon the aged parent, with whom in civilized &s;ociety he frequent|ly re&s;ides; and who often lives &s;o long as to &s;tand in his way to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a wi&s;hed-for inheritance.</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="033601_0066_0FF7A1D773611F38">
This compa&s;&s;ion, or &s;ympathy with the pains of others, ought al&s;o to extend to the brute creation, as far as our nece&s;&s;ities will admit; for we cannot exi&s;t long without the de&s;truction of other animal or vegetable beings either in their nature or embryon &s;tate. Such is the condition of mortality, that the fir&s;t law of nature is "eat, or be eaten." Hence for the pre&s;ervation of our exi&s;tence we may be &s;uppo&s;ed to have a natural right to kill tho&s;e brute creatures, which we want to eat, or which want to eat us; but to de&s;troy even in&s;ects wantonly &s;hews an unreflecting mind, or a depraved heart.</P>
<P>A young gentleman once a&s;&s;ured me, that he had lately fallen in love with a young lady; but, on their walking out one evening in &s;ummer, &s;he took two or three &s;teps out of her way on the gravel walk to tread upon an in&s;ect; and that afterwards whenever the idea of her came into his mind, it was attended with this picture of
<PB N="66" REF="033601_0067_0FF7A1DB1B04CF20">active cruelty; till that of the lady cea&s;ed to be agreeable, and he relinqui&s;hed his de&s;ign of court&s;hip.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s this &s;ympathy, however amiable and nece&s;&s;ary, may be carried to an extreme, &s;o as to render mi&s;erable the per&s;on, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es it; &s;ince many piti|able objects mu&s;t be &s;een in our journey through life, which we have not power to relieve. This then furni&s;hes us with a barrier or line, where to &s;top; that is, we &s;hould endeavour to render our little pu|pils alive to &s;ympathize with all remedia|ble evils; and at the &s;ame time to arm them with fortitude to bear the &s;ight of &s;uch irremediable evils, as the accidents of life mu&s;t frequently pre&s;ent before their eyes.</P>
<P>There &s;hould al&s;o be a plan in &s;chools to promote the habit as well as the prin|ciple of benevolence; each young lady might occa&s;ionally contribute a &s;mall &s;um
<PB N="67" REF="033601_0068_0FF7A1DDAAD59768">on &s;eeing a needy naked child to purcha&s;e flannel or coar&s;e linen for clothes, which they might learn to cut out, and to make up them&s;elves; and thus the practice of in|du&s;try might be united with that of libe|rality.</P>
<P>Another &s;till more practical mode of producing a habit of benevolence in chil|dren might be by inducing them to em|ploy &s;ome lei&s;ure hours in little works of ta&s;te, as in making artificial flowers, pur&s;es, fringes, and be&s;towing the&s;e on poor peo|ple, in order that they might &s;ell them for their &s;upport. Mi&s;s Hartley at Bath, the daughter of the great medical philo&s;opher of that name, has lately exhibited an amia|ble example of this kind of philanthropy; &s;he has been long di&s;tingui&s;hed by her ta|lents as an arti&s;t in painting; and has late|ly di&s;tributed her elegant performances among the poor fami&s;hed emigrants, who re&s;ide in her neighbourhood; who are thus greatly a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the &s;ale of her works.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="033601_0069_0FF7A1DF436439A0">
Another channel, in which this &s;ym|pathy &s;hould be taught to flow, is in the ob&s;ervance of tho&s;e attentions, which per|petually diffu&s;e happine&s;s by promoting by courte&s;y of behaviour the cheerfulne&s;s, or forwarding by ready a&s;&s;i&s;tance the intere&s;ts of tho&s;e, whether equals, inferiors, or &s;u|periors; with whom every one happens to a&s;&s;ociate or re&s;ide: which con&s;titutes the e&s;&s;ential part of what is termed politene&s;s of manners; and univer&s;ally indicates a benevolent di&s;po&s;ition.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION XVIII. VERACITY.</HEAD>
<P>FOR the purpo&s;e of inculcating a love of truth early in life the love of prai&s;e &s;upplies the mo&s;t certain means. This kind of honour has an hone&s;t pride for it's ba&s;is: a &s;tory is related in one of the mo|dern volumes of the univer&s;al hi&s;tory of an inhabitant of Con&s;tantinople, who was brought to the &s;caffold for denying the divine mi&s;&s;ion of Mahomet; and on hav|ing a pardon offered him, if he would then declare his error, an&s;wered, that he would not &s;peak an untruth to &s;ave his life. And, I think, it is recorded, that one of the fathers of the church u&s;ed to affirm, that he would not tell a lie, were he &s;ure to gain heaven by it.</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="033601_0071_0FF7A1E586BE3628">
I once heard an ingenious lady &s;ay to a company of her friends, that her daugh|ter, a young girl, who &s;tood by with a countenance flu&s;hed with plea&s;ure, never told her a lie in her life: This happy u&s;e of flattery was likely to produce a love for veracity, which would never be de&s;troyed by intere&s;ted motives.</P>
<P>The di&s;grace of telling a lie &s;hould be painted in vivid colours, as totally de|&s;tructive of the character of a lady or gen|tleman, rendering them contemptible in the eyes of the world: And the inconve|nience of this dete&s;table habit of lying &s;hould be explained from its preventing their being believed, when they wi&s;h it; as is exemplified in the fable of the &s;hepherd-boy; who called out "the wolf, the wolf," &s;o often to alarm his neighbours, and thus to amu&s;e him&s;elf, when no wolf was near; that when the real wolf attacked his flock, he could by no vociferation prevail on any
<PB N="71" REF="033601_0072_0FF7A1E714D24AB0">one to come to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance: Or like the village-drunkard, who frequently a|mu&s;ed him&s;elf with crying out "fire," along the &s;treets on his return from the ale-hou&s;e in the night, to the great alarm of the neighbourhood; till at length, when his cottage was really in flames, his di&s;tre&s;s was not believed, and he could gain no a&s;&s;i&s;tance to extingui&s;h them.</P>
<P>This &s;incerity of character &s;hould be confirmed by the example of the gover|ne&s;&s;es, who &s;hould them&s;elves pay the mo&s;t exact and &s;crupulous attention to truth; they &s;hould not exaggerate trifling errors into reprehen&s;ible faults; and, where re|proof is nece&s;&s;ary, &s;hould give it with kind|ne&s;s; and &s;hould not only punctually ful|fil their own promi&s;es, tho' to their incon|venience, but exact the &s;ame from their pupils in return.</P>
<P>To the&s;e &s;hould be added the precepts of religion, as &s;oon as their minds are ca|pable

<HEAD>SECTION XIX. PRUDENCE, JUSTICE, CHASTITY.</HEAD>
<P>THE impre&s;&s;ions on the mind made by recent examples placed, as it were, be|fore our eyes have &s;o much more durable effects, than the more ab&s;tracted ideas de|livered in &s;y&s;tems of moral philo&s;ophy; that I believe the mo&s;t efficacious method of inculcating the virtue of prudence in re&s;pect to their own conduct is by telling young people the ill con&s;equences, which have lately happened to others; who&s;e per|&s;ons or names they are acquainted with: &s;o that a repetition of the &s;lander of a town, which always degrades the retailers, has &s;ometimes its advantage as a le&s;&s;on to the hearers.</P>
<P>There is another kind of prudence, which it is nece&s;&s;ary to acquire in &s;ome de|gree,
<PB N="74" REF="033601_0075_0FF7A1EECDAAB010">which arms the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or again&s;t the ill de&s;igns of others; hence they &s;hould be taught to beware of flatterers, game&s;ters, drunkards, and of all ill-tempered per&s;ons. As this prudence is to be acquired by the knowledge of mankind, &s;uch books as the maxims of Rochfoucault, and others, might be recommended; but they give too gloo|my a picture of human nature to be put in|to the hands of young ladies.</P>
<P>"Know your&s;elf" is a celebrated in|junction, and may con&s;titute one depart|ment of Prudence, when any one under|takes &s;ome great action, or great change in the condition of life; but "know other people" is equally nece&s;&s;ary in pa&s;&s;ing along this &s;ublunary world, and may be in&s;erted with propriety as another maxim in the code of prudence. The facility of know|ing others in the daily intercour&s;e of the world is produced by the knowledge of phy&s;iognomy, acquired at &s;chools in early life; while the pa&s;&s;ions continue to be im|pre&s;&s;ed
<PB N="75" REF="033601_0076_0FF7A1F05B06F9D0">on the countenances of children; and which is never &s;o well acquired in pri|vate tuition; and thus con&s;titutes one of the great advantages of &s;chool-education.</P>
<P>JUSTICE and CHASTITY, which are the principal links, by which civilized &s;ociety is held together, are to be inculcated in young minds by &s;imilar methods; that is by pointing out by examples the public puni&s;hment, or public di&s;grace, which cer|tainly accompanies the breach of either of the&s;e important duties: and afterwards to add the precepts of religion, when their minds are capable of perceiving their force, to co-operate with the effect of the laws of &s;ociety, and of the opinion of the wi&s;e and virtuous.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION XX. FORTITUDE.</HEAD>
<P>IF female children are not treated with tenderne&s;s by a mother in their early years of infancy, they are perhaps liable to acquire a har&s;hne&s;s of character, and an ap|parent unfeelingne&s;s, which afterwards renders them le&s;s amiable; though it may give them greater fortitude; which &s;hould therefore be inculcated at their rather ma|turer years.</P>
<P>Neither the robu&s;t a&s;&s;ailing courage, which prompts to the performance of he|roic actions, nor the o&s;tentatious patience, which requires the flattery of the public eye, for its &s;upport, belong to the female character. But that &s;erene &s;trength of mind, which faces unavoidable danger with open eyes, prepared to counteract or
<PB N="77" REF="033601_0078_0FF7A1F49561EC38">to bear the nece&s;&s;ary evils of life, is equal|ly valuable as a male or female acqui&s;ition. This is termed pre&s;ence of mind; it de|pends on our judgment of the real value of things; and on our application of tho&s;e cau&s;es, which contribute to turn di&s;agreea|ble circum&s;tances to the be&s;t advantage; and can therefore only be acquired by the general cultivation of good &s;en&s;e and of knowledge.</P>
<P>An occa&s;ional effu&s;ion of tears has been thought an amiable weakne&s;s, and a mark of delicacy of the &s;ex. When tears are &s;hed at the irremediable misfortunes of others, it indicates an amiable &s;en&s;ibility; but when young ladies indulge them&s;elves in a promptitude of di&s;&s;olving into ince&s;|&s;ant tears at every trivial di&s;tre&s;s of their own, it &s;hews a kind of infantine debility of mind, and conveys an idea of their being unfit for the common duties of life; and &s;hould therefore be di&s;couraged by rea&s;on|ing on the kind and quantity of the evil,
<PB N="78" REF="033601_0079_0FF7A1F71716E768">which di&s;turbs them; and by reciting to them the examples of fortitude exhibited by others in di&s;a&s;ters much more calamit|ous, of which there are examples in the letters of Lady Ru&s;&s;el: And la&s;tly by re|minding them of the con&s;olations of reli|gion.</P>
<P>A &s;light appearance of timidity has been e&s;teemed another mark of delicacy of the &s;ex; but timidity is the companion of debility of mind rather than of delica|cy, and &s;hould not therefore be encoura|ged. In re&s;pect to the expre&s;&s;ions of fear the violent cries and di&s;torted countenan|ces of &s;ome ladies in &s;ituations of danger exhibit them in no very amiable attitudes; while they increa&s;e the confu&s;ion, and may be &s;aid "to help the &s;torm;" but if to the&s;e be added an affectation of fear without cau&s;e; as when a young lady &s;creams through the whole gamut at the &s;ight of a &s;pider, or a gra&s;s-hopper; the fault becomes voluntary, and &s;hould be
<PB N="79" REF="033601_0080_0FF7A1F99195C520">oppo&s;ed and conquered by the &s;hafts of ridicule.</P>
<P>Impudence in common language has been termed boldne&s;s; and ba&s;hfulne&s;s has been a&s;cribed to timidity; but neither of them with &s;ufficient preci&s;ion; as brave men have been known to be ba&s;hful, and cowards impudent. A&s;&s;urance of counte|nance ari&s;es from the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of it rather over-valuing his own abilities; and impu|dence con&s;i&s;ts in this a&s;&s;urance with a to|tal di&s;regard of the opinions of others; but neither of them bear any analogy to fortitude.

<P>THE precepts of religion are be&s;t taught by requiring the young pupils regu|larly to attend &s;uch places of divine wor&s;hip as their parents direct; and by reading on Sundays &s;elect parts of the holy &s;criptures, and &s;ome approved books of &s;ermons; as tho&s;e of Blair, and a few others; and by inculating the rea&s;onablene&s;s of daily thank&s;giving, and the duty of daily pray|er, to the great author of all good.</P>
<P>The divine morality delivered in the new te&s;tament &s;hould be repeatedly incul|cated to an infant audience, who cannot &s;o well under&s;tand the metaphy&s;ical parts of religion, &s;uch as the duty of doing to others
<PB N="84" REF="033601_0085_0FF7A20419F95678">as we would they &s;hould do unto us: to love our neighbours as our&s;elves: to for|give injuries, not to revenge them: and to be kind even to our enemies. For this purpo&s;e the &s;ermons of the old Whole du|ty of man are recommended; one of which might be read every Sunday evening.</P>
<P>Ladies of more mature years, or who have fini&s;hed their &s;chool-education, may learn the nece&s;&s;ity and u&s;efulne&s;s of our ex|cellent religion from Baron Haller's letters to his daughter, from Lady Pennington's advice to her daughter, and la&s;tly from Mr. Gi&s;borne's duties of the female &s;ex: and the defence of the truth of it may be learn|ed from Mr. Payley's evidences of chri&s;ti|anity; but perhaps it is better for them not to perplex their minds with many works of religious controver&s;y.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION XXIII. ADDRESS.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is a fa&s;cinating manner in the addre&s;s of &s;ome people, which almo&s;t in&s;tantly conciliates the good will, and even the confidence of their acquaintance. Ma|chiavel in his hi&s;tory of Ca&s;truccio Ca&s;tri|cani ob&s;erves; that his hero could a&s;&s;ume &s;uch openne&s;s of countenance; that though he was known to be a man practi&s;ed in every kind of fraud and treachery, yet in a few minutes he gained the confidence of all, whom he conver&s;ed with; they went away &s;atisfied of his good will towards them, and were betrayed to their ruin.</P>
<P>This enviable addre&s;s, which may be u&s;ed for good purpo&s;es as well as for bad ones, may be difficult to analize; but may po&s;&s;ibly con&s;i&s;t &s;imply in a countenance ani|mated
<PB N="86" REF="033601_0087_0FF7A209368E6670">with plea&s;ure at meeting and con|ver&s;ing with our acquaintance; and which diffu&s;es cheerfulne&s;s by plea&s;urable conta|gion into the bo&s;oms of others; and thus in|tere&s;ts them in our behalf. It is not the &s;mile of flattery, nor the &s;mile of &s;elf-ap|probation, nor the &s;mile of habit, nor of le|vity; but it is &s;imply an expre&s;&s;ion of plea|&s;ure, which &s;eems to ari&s;e at the fight of our acquaintance; and which per&s;uades them, that they po&s;&s;e&s;s our love, and for which they barter their own in return.</P>
<P>However this conciliating manner may have been u&s;ed, as above related, for bad pur|po&s;es; it probably proceeded originally from friendline&s;s and openne&s;s of heart, with cheerful benevolence; and that in tho&s;e, who have in proce&s;s of time become bad characters, the appearance of tho&s;e vir|tues has remained, after the reality of them has vani&s;hed. What then is the method, by which this inchantment of countenance can be taught? certainly by in&s;tilling cheer|fulne&s;s
<PB N="87" REF="033601_0088_0FF77E8DE46759E8">and benevolence into the minds of young ladies early in life, and at the &s;ame time an animation of countenance in ex|pre&s;&s;ing them; and though this plea&s;urable animation be at fir&s;t only copied, it will in time have the appearance of being natural; and will contribute to produce by a&s;&s;ocia|tion the very cheerfulne&s;s and benevolence, which it at fir&s;t only imitated. This is a golden ob&s;ervation to tho&s;e, who have the care of young children.</P>
<P>A very accompli&s;hed lady, who read the manu&s;cript of this work, wrote the &s;ol|lowing with her pencil on the oppo&s;ite page; "nothing can be more ju&s;t and intere&s;ting than the whole of this &s;ection; yet however de&s;irable it may be to mend an unplea&s;ant <HI>abord,</HI> might one not &s;u&s;pect, &s;ince Nature has produced a diver&s;ity of manner, that an attempt to engraft this beautiful cheerful|ne&s;s on a grave &s;et of features might produce the wor&s;t of evil affectations? A natural &s;im|plicity of manner, whether &s;erious or gay,
<PB N="88" REF="033601_0089_0FF7A20E38CF1740">will always plea&s;e; and probably this amia|ble addre&s;s may be rendered equally con&s;i&s;t|ent with natural manners, whether &s;erious or gay?"</P>

<HEAD>SECTION XXIV. CONVERSATION.</HEAD>
<P>NEXT to the winning manners above de&s;cribed, the art of plea&s;ing in conver&s;a|tion &s;eems to con&s;i&s;t in two things; one of them to hear well; and the other to &s;peak well. The perpetual appearance of attention, and the varying expre&s;&s;ion of the countenance of the hearer to the &s;entiments or pa&s;&s;ions of the &s;peaker; is a principal charm in con|ver&s;ation; to be well heard and accurately under&s;tood encourages our companions to proceed with plea&s;ure, whatever may be the topics of their di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e, who have been educated at &s;chools, and have learnt the knowledge of phy&s;iognomy from their playfellows in their early years, under&s;tand the plea&s;urable or painful fellings of all with whom they com|ver&s;e,
<PB N="90" REF="033601_0091_0FF7A2124EADB4A8">often even before their words are fi|ni&s;hed; and, by thus immediately conform|ing the expre&s;&s;ion of their own features to the &s;en&s;ations of the &s;peaker, become the intere&s;ting and animated companions a|bove de&s;cribed, which is &s;eldom &s;een in tho&s;e educated in private families; and which, as before ob&s;erved, gives a pre|ference to &s;chool-education.</P>
<P>To &s;peak agreeably in re&s;pect to manner con&s;i&s;ts in a voice clear, yet not loud, &s;oft, yet not plaintive; with di&s;|tinct articulation, and with graceful atti|tudes rather than with graceful actions; as almo&s;t every kind of ge&s;ticulation is di&s;agreeable. In re&s;pect to the matter it &s;hould be &s;uch as coincides with the ta&s;tes or pur&s;uits of tho&s;e, to whom the conver&s;ation is addre&s;&s;ed. From hence it will appear, that both to hear well, and to &s;peak well, requires an exten&s;ive knowledge of things, as well as of the ta&s;tes and pur&s;uits of mankind; and mu&s;t
<PB N="91" REF="033601_0092_0FF7A214D2855540">therefore ultimately be the effect of a good education in general, rather than a particular article of it.</P>
<P>There are however faults to be a|voided, and cautious to be ob&s;erved, in the conver&s;ation of young ladies; which &s;hould be pointed out to them by the go|verne&s;s of a boarding &s;chool. Of the&s;e I &s;hall mention fir&s;t, that whenever the thir&s;t of &s;hining in conver&s;ation &s;eizes on the heart, the vanity of the &s;peaker be|comes apparent; and we are di&s;gu&s;ted with the manner, whatever may be the matter of the di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>Secondly, that it is always childi&s;h, and generally ridiculous, when young people boa&s;t of their follies, or when they accu&s;e them&s;elves of virtues; nei|ther of which they probably po&s;&s;e&s;s in the degree, which they de&s;cribe. A young lady was heard to &s;ay, "I am frightened to death at the &s;ight of a
<PB N="92" REF="033601_0093_0FF7A2165F9AFCF8">bird:" And another, that &s;he was &s;o in|con&s;iderate, as to give her money to the poor naked children, whom &s;he &s;aw in the &s;treets in winter.</P>
<P>Thirdly, they &s;hould be apprized, that there is danger in &s;peaking ill even of a bad per&s;on; both becau&s;e they may have been mi&s;informed, and becau&s;e they &s;hould judge their neighbours with charity. A friend of mine was once a&s;ked by a young man, how he could di&s;tingui&s;h, whether the lady, whom he meant to addre&s;s, was good tempered; and gave this an&s;wer. "When any du|bious accu&s;ation is brought in conver&s;a|tion again&s;t an ab&s;ent per&s;on; if &s;he al|ways inclines to believe the wor&s;t &s;ide of the que&s;tion, &s;he is ill-tempered." There are &s;ome nice di&s;tinctions on this &s;ubject of good nature delivered in Lady Pen|nington's advice to her daughters, which are worth a young lady's attention.</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="033601_0094_0FF7A218F72B36F8">
Fourthly, that it is dangerous for a young lady to &s;peak very highly in prai&s;e even of a de&s;erving man; for if &s;he ex|tols his actions, &s;he will &s;eem to give her|&s;elf the importance of a judge, and her determinations will &s;ometimes be called in que&s;tion; and to commend highly the per&s;on of a man is in general e&s;timation incon&s;i&s;tent with the delicacy of the &s;ex at any age.</P>
<P>Fifthly, young ladies &s;hould be ad|vi&s;ed not to accu&s;tom them&s;elves to the u&s;e of &s;trong a&s;&s;everations, or of a kind of petty oaths, &s;uch as "upon my ho|nour," in their conver&s;ation; nor often to appeal to others for the truth of what they affirm; &s;ince all &s;uch &s;trong expre&s;|&s;ions and appeals derogate &s;omewhat from the character of the &s;peaker: as they give an intimation, that &s;he has not been u&s;ually believed on her &s;imple a&s;|&s;ertion.</P>
<P><PB N="94" REF="033601_0095_0FF7A2DB8F349FB8">
Sixthly, laughing vehemently aloud, or tittering with &s;hort &s;hrieks, in which &s;ome young ladies, who have left &s;chool, indulge them&s;elves at cards or other a|mu&s;ements, are reprehen&s;ible; as their dignity of character mu&s;t &s;uffer by appear|ing too violently agitated at trivial circum|&s;tances.</P>
<P>Seventhly, and uniform adherence to &s;incerity in conver&s;ation is of the fir&s;t im|portance; as without it our words are but empty &s;ounds, and can no more intere&s;t our companions than the tinkling of a bell. No artificial poli&s;h of manners can com|pen&s;ate for the apparent want of this vir|tue, nor any acquirements of knowledge for the reality of the want of it. Hence though the exce&s;s of blame or prai&s;e of the actions of others may be imprudent or im|proper in the conver&s;ation of young la|dies; as mentioned in the third and fourth articles of this &s;ection; yet in the&s;e, as in all other kinds of conver&s;ation, their opini|ons
<PB N="95" REF="033601_0096_0FF77EB1B561AA28">&s;hould be given with truth, if given at all; but when the character <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> are concerned, they &s;hould <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> with diffidence and mode&s;ty.</P>
<P>La&s;tly, if at any time any improper di&s;|cour&s;e &s;hould be addre&s;&s;ed to young ladies, which has a tendency to indecency, im|morality, or irreligion, they &s;hould be taught to expre&s;s a marked di&s;approbation both in words and countenance. So great is the power of the &s;o&s;ter &s;ex in meliora|ting the characters of men; that, if &s;uch was their uniform behaviour, I doubt not, but that it would much contribute to reform the morals of the age; an event de|voutly to be wi&s;hed, and which would con|tribute much to their own happine&s;s.</P>
<P>To the&s;e might be added many other ob&s;ervations from the writers on female education concerning a due re&s;pect in conver&s;ation to &s;uperiors, good temper to
<PB N="96" REF="033601_0097_0FF77EB34F954200">equals, and conde&s;cen&s;ion to inferiors. But as young ladies are not expected to &s;peak with the wi&s;dom, or preci&s;ion of philo&s;ophers; and as the carele&s;s cheerful|ne&s;s of their conver&s;ation, with &s;implicity of manner, and with the grace, ea&s;e, and vivacity natural to youth, &s;upplies it with its principal charms; the&s;e &s;hould be par|ticularly encouraged, as there are few ar|tificial accompli&s;hments, which could com|pen&s;ate for the lo&s;s of them.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION XXV. EXERCISE.</HEAD>
<P>THE acquirements of literature, and of many arts, make the lives of young peo|ple too &s;edentary; which impairs their &s;trength, makes their countenances pale and bloated, and lays the foundation of many di&s;ea&s;es; hence &s;ome hours &s;hould every day be appropriated to bodily exer|ci&s;es, and to relaxation of mind.</P>
<P>Such as tend to produce activity, and to promote the growth of the per&s;on in re&s;|pect to height, are preferred in the &s;chools for young ladies to tho&s;e, which render the &s;y&s;tem more robu&s;t and mu&s;cular.</P>
<P>Of the&s;e playing at ball, at &s;huttlecock, &s;winging as they &s;it on a cord or cu&s;hion,
<PB N="98" REF="033601_0099_0FF77EC355D38640">and dancing, in the open air in &s;ummer, and within doors in winter, are to be pre|ferred. To the&s;e &s;ome have recommend|ed an exerci&s;e of the arms by &s;winging lead|en weights, which are called dumb bells; the&s;e &s;hould be very light, if they be u&s;ed at all, otherwi&s;e they load the &s;pine of the back, and render the &s;houlders thick and mu&s;cular, and rather impede than forward the perpendicular growth of the per&s;on. The ringing of a real bell hung as is done in churches, or the frequent drawing up of a weight by a cord over a pulley, with a fly-wheel to prevent its too ha&s;ty de&s;cent, would be an exerci&s;e, which might be u&s;ed with great advantage by young people; as it both extends the &s;pine, and &s;trengthens the mu&s;cles of the che&s;t and arms.</P>
<P>Many other kinds of exerci&s;e have been recommended by authors: Madame Gen|lis advi&s;es weights to be carried on the head, as milk-maids carry their milk-pails;
<PB N="99" REF="033601_0100_0FF77F589DDEB2B0">and even to add weights to the &s;oles of the &s;hoes of children to &s;trengthen, as &s;he &s;up|po&s;es, the mu&s;cles of locomotion in walk|ing or running. It is evident, that carry|ing weights on the head mu&s;t be injurious to young people, e&s;pecially when there is a tendency to &s;oftne&s;s of the bones; as it may contribute to bend the &s;pine by their pre&s;&s;ure, and to impede the perpendicular growth of the body; and the walking in weighted &s;hoes may induce awkward ge&s;|tures without any adequate advantage.</P>
<P>There are other modes of exertion, which, though graceful in them&s;elves, are not allowed to ladies by the fa&s;hion of this age and country; as &s;kating on the ice in winter, &s;wimming in &s;ummer, funambula|tion, or dancing on the &s;treight rope: but walking with a &s;tately mea&s;ured &s;tep occa|&s;ionally, like the march of &s;oldiers, and reading aloud frequently rather in a thea|tric manner, as well as dancing and &s;inging,
<PB N="100" REF="033601_0101_0FF77F5B79642F38">will much contribute to give &s;trength and grace to the mu&s;cles of locomotion, and of vocality.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION XXVI. AIR.</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;trength and activity of young people not only depends on the perpetual exerci&s;e of their limbs, as de&s;cribed in the preceding &s;ections, but on the purity of the air, which they breathe, and even on the occa&s;ional coldne&s;s of it. The cold air of winter acts on delicate people like a cold bath; as it dimini&s;hes the action of the &s;ub|cutaneous ve&s;&s;els for a time, and thus pro|duces an accumulation of animal power, whence an increa&s;ed action of tho&s;e ve&s;&s;els and a con&s;equent warmth of the &s;urface of the body &s;ucceeds; and by this le&s;s expen|diture of animal power during immer&s;ion in cold air, and its con&s;equent accumula|tion, the per&s;on becomes &s;tronger for a time and more animated; which is termed
<PB N="102" REF="033601_0103_0FF77F600644C450">in common language, "bracing the &s;y&s;|tem." Hence to &s;trengthen delicate chil|dren they &s;hould be encouraged to go into the cold air of winter frequently, but &s;hould not remain in it longer than a quarter or half an hour at a time. In &s;ummer young people can &s;carcely continue too much in the air, where they are &s;haded from the heat of the &s;un.</P>
<P>A con&s;tant immer&s;ion in pure air is now known to contribute much both to the health of the &s;y&s;tem, and to the beau|tiful colour of the complexion. And this atmo&s;phere &s;hould undergo a perpetual change and renovation; that the vital air, which con&s;titutes about one-fourth part of it, may not be too much dimini&s;hed by frequent re&s;piration. Due attention &s;hould be given to this important circum&s;tance both by frequently urging the young la|dies to amu&s;e them&s;elves out of doors; and by the proper ventilation of the &s;chool-room, dining-room, bed-rooms, and
<PB N="103" REF="033601_0104_0FF7A21B6ECBD008">their other apartments. For this purpo&s;e it is convenient to &s;aw off about one inch from the top of every door of the&s;e crowd|ed rooms, and oppo&s;ite to this aperture to nail along the top of the door a tin plate about two inches wide, ri&s;ing at an angle of about forty-five degrees; which will bend the current of air up towards the ceil|ing; where it will be mixed with the warm air of the room, and &s;ink down a|mong&s;t the &s;ociety without the danger of giving cold to any one: And, be&s;ides the&s;e door-ventilators, the upper &s;a&s;hes of every window &s;hould always be let down a few inches, when the external weather will admit of it.</P>
<P>In re&s;pect to bed rooms, which have more than one bed, the doors &s;hould be furni&s;hed with &s;imilar ventilators for the due admi&s;&s;ion of fre&s;h air; and during the &s;ummer-months a window &s;hould be kept a few inches open during the night as well as the day; the &s;a&s;h of which &s;hould have
<PB N="104" REF="033601_0105_0FF7A21E0B5C0CF0">a bolt or other proper fa&s;tening for this purpo&s;e; nor &s;hould the fire-place be &s;topt up at any &s;ea&s;on by a chimney-board, or a bag of &s;traw; as many rooms are made to &s;hut up &s;o clo&s;e, that this is the only aperture, by which fre&s;h air is admitted. To this &s;hould be added, that the bed-curtains &s;hould never be drawn clo&s;e round the beds; which confine the air &s;poiled by frequent re&s;piration, and the per&s;pirable matter, like a noxious at|mo&s;phere over the uncon&s;cious &s;leepers. At the &s;ame time none of the beds &s;hould be placed very near either to an open win|dow, or to an open chimney, as a partial current of air might be injurious by the coldne&s;s it might occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>In crowded bed-rooms, where children are clo&s;e &s;hut up for eight or nine hours every night, not only the pale bloated complexion, which is &s;een in children of crowded manufactories; but other di&s;ea&s;es are produced by the impurity of the air,
<PB N="105" REF="033601_0106_0FF7A21F985D9450">&s;uch as indige&s;tion, difficulty of breath|ing, and &s;ometimes convul&s;ive fits, as mentioned in Zoonomia, vol. II. cla&s;s. iii. 1.1.5. and la&s;tly putrid fevers; of which fatal in&s;tances frequently occur in the crowded habitations of the poor. Hence parents cannot be too careful in in&s;pecting the bed-rooms, and the beds of the &s;chools, to which they entru&s;t their children; as not only their pre&s;ent comfort, but their future health, and &s;ometimes their lives depend on this attention; as is further explained in the &s;ection on rheumati&s;m.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the due ventilation of rooms by a perpetual &s;upply of pure air in &s;um|mer, &s;omething &s;hould be here &s;aid about the manner of warming them in winter. As the quantity of air carried up a chim|ney is very great, owing to its being ren|dered &s;o much lighter than the external atmo&s;phere by the heat of the fire, &s;trong currents of cold air pre&s;s into the room at every chink of the doors and windows
<PB N="106" REF="033601_0107_0FF7A22152320520">pa&s;&s;ing towards the fire; and are liable to give catarrh, rheumati&s;m, kibed heels, and &s;welled fingers, to tho&s;e &s;cholars, who are expo&s;ed to them. To le&s;&s;en the&s;e cur|rents of cold air &s;etting in at every aper|ture, the chimney &s;hould be &s;o contracted over the fire-grate, as to admit no more of the warm air to go up it, than is nece&s;&s;ary to carry up the &s;moke; and hence much more of the warm air near the fire-place will ri&s;e up to the cieling; and de&s;cend|ing, as it becomes cooler, in the di&s;tant parts of the room, will form a kind of ver|tical eddy, and warm the whole apart|ment; adding greatly to the heat produ|ced by the radiation from the fire.</P>
<P>To effect this Doctor Franklin recom|mended an iron or tin plate to &s;lide under the mantle-piece over the fire, &s;o as to con|tract the aperture of the chimney to two or three inches in width, all the length over the fire-grate. And lately Count Rumford has accompli&s;hed the &s;ame purpo&s;e by a
<PB N="107" REF="033601_0108_0FF7A225F96004D0">flat &s;tone about twelve inches broad, and eighteen inches high; which is reared up|on one end at the back of the fire-place, a|bout eight inches above the grate, and leans forward towards the mantle-piece, &s;o as to leave an aperture, three or four inches wide, and twelve or fourteen inches long, over the front of the fire-place. The u&s;e of both the&s;e contrivances is to contract the mouth of the chimney, and thus to ad|mit no more warm air up it, than is nece&s;|&s;ary to convey the &s;moke. And the &s;lid|ing iron plate in Franklin's plan, and the end-reared &s;tone in Rumford's plan, are de&s;igned to be occa&s;ionally withdrawn for the admittance of the chimney-&s;weeper. The&s;e are de&s;cribed in detail in the e&s;&s;ays of Doctor Franklin, and Count Rumford; and it is believed, that one-third of the fuel may be thus &s;aved, and the rooms be kept more equally warm, and more &s;alu|tary.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION XXVII. CARE OF THE SHAPE.</HEAD>
<P>DELICATE young ladies are very liable to become awry at many board|ing &s;chools, this is occa&s;ioned principal|ly by their being obliged too long to pre|&s;erve an erect attitude, by &s;itting on forms for many hours together. To prevent this, the &s;chool-&s;eats &s;hould ei|ther have backs, on which they may oc|ca&s;ionally re&s;t them&s;elves; or de&s;ks be|fore them, on which they may occa&s;ion|ally lean. This is a thing of greater con|&s;equence, than may appear to tho&s;e, who have not attended to it; and who wi&s;h their children to acquire a very erect attitude.</P>
<P><PB N="109" REF="033601_0110_0FF7A22929F852E0">
When the lea&s;t tendency to become awry is ob&s;erved, they &s;hould be advi&s;|ed to lie down on a bed or &s;ofa for an hour in the middle of the day for many months; which generally prevents the increa&s;e of this deformity by taking off for a time the pre&s;&s;ure of the head and neck and &s;houlders on the &s;pine of the back; and it at the &s;ame time tends to make them grow taller.</P>
<P>Young per&s;ons, when nicely mea&s;ur|ed, are found to be half an inch higher in the morning than at night; as is well known to tho&s;e, who inli&s;t very young men for &s;oldiers. This is owing to the cartilages between the bones of the back becoming compre&s;&s;ed by the weight of the head and &s;houlders on them during the day. It is the &s;ame pre&s;&s;ure, which produces curvitures and di&s;tortions of the &s;pine in growing children, where the bones are &s;ofter than u&s;ual; and which may thus be relieved by an hori|zontal
<PB N="110" REF="033601_0111_0FF7A22BC7D09C40">po&s;ture for an hour in the middle of the day, or by being frequently allow|ed to lean on a chair, or to play on a carpet on the ground.</P>
<P>Young ladies &s;hould al&s;o be directed, where two &s;leep in a bed, to change every night, or every week, their &s;ides of the bed; which will prevent their tendency to &s;leep always on the &s;ame &s;ide; which is not only liable to produce crook|edne&s;s, but al&s;o to occa&s;ion di&s;ea&s;es by the internal parts being &s;o long kept in uniform contact as to grow together. For the &s;ame rea&s;on they &s;hould not be allowed to &s;it always on the &s;ame &s;ide of the fire or window: becau&s;e they will then be inclined too frequently to bend towards one &s;ide; which in tho&s;e con&s;ti|tutions, where the bones are too &s;oft, is liable to produce crookedne&s;s of the &s;pine.</P>
<P><PB N="111" REF="033601_0112_0FF7A22D563E88C8">
Another great cau&s;e of injury to the &s;hape of young ladies is from the pre&s;|&s;ure of &s;tays, or other tight bandages; which at the &s;ame time cau&s;e other di&s;|ea&s;es by changing the form or &s;ituation of the internal parts. If a hard part of the &s;tays, even a knot of the thread, with which they are &s;ewed together, is pre&s;&s;|ed upon one &s;ide more than the other; the child bends from the &s;ide, which is unea&s;y, and thus occa&s;ions a curviture of the &s;pine. To counteract this effect &s;uch &s;tays, as have fewe&s;t hard parts, and e&s;pecially &s;uch as can be daily or week|ly turned, are preferable to others. A wi&s;e fa&s;hion of wearing no &s;tiff &s;tays, which adds &s;o much to the beauty of young ladies, has commenced &s;ince the above was written; and long may it continue!</P>
<P>Where frequently lying down on a &s;ofa in the day time, and &s;winging fre|quently

<P>It will be from hence ea&s;ily perceived that all other methods of confining or di|recting the growth of young people &s;hould be u&s;ed with great &s;kill, &s;uch as back|boards, or bandages; and that their appli|cation &s;hould not be continued too long at a time; lea&s;t wor&s;e con&s;equences &s;hould en&s;ue, than the deformity they are de&s;ign|ed

Of the&s;e the &s;tocks for the feet of children, for the purpo&s;e of making them turn their toes quite out, and the frame for pre&s;&s;ing in their knees, as they &s;tand erect, at the &s;ame time, I &s;u&s;pect, when carried to exce&s;s, to be particularly injurious, and to have cau&s;ed an irrecover|able lamene&s;s of hip-joint; as explained in Zoonomia, vol. II. cla&s;s I. 2.2.17. The&s;e therefore &s;hould be u&s;ed with pro|per caution, &s;o as to give no pain or un|ea&s;y feels, or not u&s;ed at all.</P>
<P>To this it may be proper to add, that the &s;tiff erect attitude, taught by &s;ome mo|dern dancing ma&s;ters, does not contribute to the grace of per&s;on, but rather militates again&s;t it; as is well &s;een in one of the prints in Hogarth's analy&s;is of beauty; and is exemplified by the ea&s;y grace of &s;ome of the ancient &s;tatues, as of the Venus de Medici, and the Antinous; and in the works of &s;ome modern arti&s;ts, as in a beau|tiful print of Hebe feeding an eagle,
<PB N="114" REF="033601_0115_0FF7A234E963D728">painted by Hamilton, and engraved by Eginton; and many of the figures of An|gelica Kauffman. And la&s;tly, which is &s;o eminently &s;een in many of the beauties of the pre&s;ent day, &s;ince they have left off the con&s;traint of whale-bone &s;tays, and a&s;|&s;umed the graceful dre&s;s of the ancient Grecian &s;tatues.</P>
<P>In the tendency to curviture of the &s;pine whatever &s;trengthens the general con&s;titution is of &s;ervice, as the u&s;e of the cold bath in the &s;ummer months. This however requires &s;ome re&s;triction both in re&s;pect to the degree of coldne&s;s of the bath, the time of continuing in it, and the &s;ea&s;on of the year. Common &s;prings, which are of 48 degrees of heat, are too cold for tender con&s;titutions, whether of children or adults; and frequently do them great and irreparable injury, as I have witne&s;&s;ed in three or four ca&s;es. The coldne&s;s of river water in the &s;ummer
<PB N="115" REF="033601_0116_0FF7A237823FA730">months, which is about 65 degrees, or that of Matlock, which is about 68, or of Bux|ton, which is 82, are much to be prefer|red: The two latter are improperly called warm baths, comparing their degree of heat with that of common &s;prings; where|as they are in reality cold baths, being of much lower degree of heat than that of the human body, which is 98. The time of continuing in a cold bath &s;hould be but a few minutes; certainly not &s;o long as to occa&s;ion a trembling of the limbs from cold. In re&s;pect to the &s;ea&s;on of the year, delicate children &s;hould certainly only u&s;e cold bathings in the &s;ummer months; as the going frequently into the cold air in winter will an&s;wer all the purpo&s;es of the cold bath.</P>

<P>YOUNG Ladies &s;hould be in&s;truct|ed to &s;hew attention to their dre&s;s, as it gives an idea of cleanline&s;s of their per|&s;ons; which has &s;o great a charm, that it may be reckoned among&s;t the inferior vir|tues; for this purpo&s;e an elegant &s;implici|ty of dre&s;s is to be recommended in pre|ference to that &s;uperabundance of orna|ment, where the lady her&s;elf is the lea&s;t part of her. The form of dre&s;s mu&s;t ne|verthele&s;s perpetually vary with the fa&s;hion of the time; but a per&s;on of ta&s;te may le&s;&s;en tho&s;e parts of a fa&s;hionable dre&s;s, which oppo&s;e beauty or grace; and bring forwards tho&s;e, which are more coincident with them; &s;o as to wear a dre&s;s in fa&s;hion, and yet not devoid of ta&s;te.</P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="033601_0119_0FF7A23E3604E350">
Thus when large hoops were in gene|ral u&s;e, which &s;o totally militate with all ideas of beauty and grace; ladies of ta&s;te wore them as &s;mall, as cu&s;tom would al|low. So in re&s;pect to the ear-rings of the pre&s;ent day; &s;ince piercing the tender part of the ear for the purpo&s;e of &s;u&s;pend|ing a weight of gold, or of precious &s;tones, or of gla&s;s beads to it, reminds us of the &s;avage &s;tate of mankind; tho&s;e ladies of ta&s;te, who think them&s;elves obliged to com|ply with this indecorous fa&s;hion, u&s;e the lighte&s;t materials, as a chain of &s;mall pearls, to give a le&s;s di&s;tre&s;&s;ing idea of the pain, they &s;eem to &s;uffer at every motion of their heads. Hence al&s;o long pendant and complicated ear-rings, however they may add to the dignity of riper years by their co&s;tline&s;s, are unbecoming to young ladies; as they &s;eem to give pain in the quicker, tho' more graceful, motions of juvenility.</P>
<P>Sir Jo&s;hua Reynolds, I think, ob&s;erves in one of his addre&s;&s;es to the academy,
<PB N="119" REF="033601_0120_0FF7A241E0D3F610">that hard curls of hair &s;tiffened with the fat of hogs, and covered with the flower of wheat, cannot be admitted into picture. The &s;ame may be ob&s;erved of that coat of mail, the whale-bone &s;tays, the u&s;e of which is now &s;o happily di&s;continued. Both of the&s;e, however they may conceal the grey hairs and waining figures of tho&s;e, who are advanced in life, are highly inju|rious to the flowing locks and graceful forms of young ladies.</P>
<P>As beauty con&s;i&s;ts of lines flowing in ea&s;y curves according to the analy&s;is of Hogarth; tho&s;e parts of dre&s;s, which are compo&s;ed of &s;uch lines, are always agreea|ble. Thus a &s;a&s;h de&s;cending from one &s;houlder to the oppo&s;ite hip, or a grecian veil thrown back and winding carele&s;sly down behind, are always beautiful; but a few white o&s;trich feathers ri&s;ing on the head before, and a train of &s;ilk &s;weeping on the ground behind, add &s;o much grace to a moving female figure, as to attract all eyes with uncea&s;ing admiration.</P>
<P><PB N="120" REF="033601_0121_0FF7A24374114CC8">
In moving forwards the hair falls back, and in very &s;wift motion floats upon the air behind; hence by a&s;&s;ociation of ideas, when the hair is made to retire from the cheeks, it gives an intimation of the youth|ful agility of the per&s;on; and when it is brought forwards over the cheeks, it may con&s;ent with unmoving dignity, like the full wig of a judge, but dimini&s;hes our idea of the activity of playful youth.</P>
<P>Where the appearance of u&s;e in dre&s;s can be given to ornaments, it &s;ugge&s;ts an excu&s;e for wearing them, and is therefore to be preferred; as diamond pins, &s;trings of pearl, and a comb of &s;hell, to re&s;train the exuberant hair; or knots of ribbons to fix the &s;lipper on the foot, to contract the &s;leeve around the arm, to unite the ve&s;t up|on the bo&s;om, or to attach the cap above the forehead. And when the&s;e are &s;imilar in colour, it gives an air of &s;implicity, and a kind of pyramidal form to the dre&s;s; which the painters &s;o much endeavour to
<PB N="121" REF="033601_0122_0FF7A245064DA5C0">exhibit both in their land&s;capes, and their groups of figures.</P>
<P>Other ornaments, which bear no analo|gy to u&s;e in dre&s;s, &s;hould be &s;paringly worn; le&s;t they give an idea, that they were de&s;igned to di&s;play the pride of the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, rather than to decorate her per|&s;on. The&s;e are &s;ometimes &s;een &s;o ill placed as to make deformities con&s;picuous, as a number of rings on &s;ingers di&s;torted with the gout, or &s;plendid buckles on turn|ed-in feet. Where there is no appear|ance of u&s;e, all &s;hining ornaments &s;hould be &s;o di&s;po&s;ed as to direct the eye of the be|holder to &s;ome beautiful feature of the la|dy, who wears them; as diamond &s;tars in the hair, and artificial flowers on the bo&s;om.</P>
<P>Paint and perfumes are totally inadmi&s;|&s;ible in the dre&s;s of young ladies, as they give a &s;u&s;picion of natural defects in re&s;|pect to colour of the &s;kin, and odour
<PB N="122" REF="033601_0123_0FF7A2469D53B890">of the breath. Where there exi&s;ts but a mediocrity of beauty, and youth is in the wain, a variety of pretty or of co&s;tly ornaments on the dre&s;s, and even the whitene&s;s of powder in the hair, may &s;ometimes mingle with our idea of the per|&s;on, and &s;eem to render the whole fairer, more plea&s;ing, or more re&s;pectable. But ornaments of every kind are u&s;ele&s;s or in|jurious to youthful beauty; they add no power to the charm, but rather di&s;enchant the beholder by ab&s;tracting his attention; which dwells with undimini&s;hed rapture on beauty arrayed by &s;implicity, and ani|mated without affectation. Thus the ma|je&s;tic juno of Homer is arrayed in variety of ornament, and with ear-rings, which have three large pendant bobs to each, and commands univer&s;al homage. But his Queen of Beauty is dre&s;&s;ed with more &s;im|ple elegance, in her magic &s;a&s;h, or ce&s;tus, and charms all eyes.</P>
<P>The attention to ta&s;te in dre&s;s may ne|verthele&s;s be carried into an extreme; it
<PB N="123" REF="033601_0124_0FF7A24B2C5C79D0">&s;hould not &s;eem to be the mo&s;t important part of the education of a young lady; or the principal object of her care; &s;he &s;hould rather appear to follow than to lead the fa|&s;hion, according to the lines of Mr. Pope.</P>

<P>IT is the cu&s;tom of many &s;chools to u&s;e &s;ome kinds of puni&s;hments, which either give pain or di&s;grace to the delin|quent, as a fool's cap, or a meal of water gruel. The u&s;e of the&s;e are &s;eldom if ever nece&s;&s;ary in &s;chools for young ladies, and are always attended with di&s;agreeable con&s;equences, as they either dimini&s;h the character of honour in the puni&s;hed per|&s;ons, &s;ink their &s;pirits, or render them in|&s;en&s;ible to the opinions of others; or in|jure their health: In&s;omuch that at &s;ome &s;chools all that can be acquired can &s;carce|ly compen&s;ate the lo&s;s of cheerfulne&s;s, and degradation of mind, or bad health, which their puni&s;hments produce.</P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="033601_0128_0FF7A253C5AE1618">
Thus the &s;itting in the public &s;chool for an hour in a cap with bells dimini&s;hes the &s;en&s;ibility of a child to the opinions of her companions, and thus gradually de|&s;troys one of the greate&s;t motives to good actions, and of the greate&s;t re&s;traints from bad ones. For the &s;ame rea&s;on repri|mands and even admonitions &s;hould be al|ways applied in private, but applau&s;e or re|ward in public.</P>
<P>A meal of water gruel, given as a pu|ni&s;hment in&s;tead of a meal of animal food, &s;o frequently had recour&s;e to in &s;ome boarding &s;chools, I believe to have laid the foundation of incurable debility. The di&s;ea&s;es of debility, as &s;crophula, bronch|ocele, &s;oftne&s;s of bones, and the con&s;e|quent di&s;tortion of them, are very com|mon among the children of the poor in Derby, which on examination, I believe to be owing to their food con&s;i&s;ting chiefly of gruel; or &s;ometimes with milk, which has been twice &s;kimmed, &s;o that it is total|ly
<PB N="128" REF="033601_0129_0FF7A2565E86F4E8">deprived of its mo&s;t nouri&s;hing part; at other times with weak &s;alt broth, but &s;el|dom with &s;olid animal food. When broth is weak in re&s;pect to the quantity of fle&s;h|meat boiled in it, it is the cu&s;tom of cooks to add much &s;alt to it to increa&s;e the reli&s;h, which renders it &s;till more injurious to weak children; as &s;alt contains no nou|ri&s;hment, and by its &s;timulus increa&s;es the action of the &s;y&s;tem; and by promoting great in&s;en&s;ible or &s;en&s;ible per&s;piration di|mini&s;hes the &s;trength of the child more, than the &s;mall quantity of meat di&s;&s;olved in the broth can counterbalance.</P>
<P N="2">2. How then are refractory children to be governed? certainly by the &s;uperi|ority of the mind of the teacher over that of the pupil. When a famous lady in Italy was put to the torture, and que&s;tion|ed by what &s;orcery &s;he had governed a prince&s;s of the family of Medici; &s;he an|&s;wered "by no &s;orcery, but by that power, which &s;uperior minds po&s;&s;e&s;s over inferi|or ones."</P>

3.

E&s;teem and di&s;grace are ob&s;erved by Mr. Locke to be of all others the mo&s;t powerful incentives to the mind, when once it is brought to regard them: And if once you can communicate to chil|dren a love of credit, and an apprehen&s;ion of &s;hame, you have in&s;tilled into them a principle, which will con&s;tantly act, and incline them to do right, tho' it is not the true &s;ource from whence our actions ought to &s;pring; which &s;hould be from our duty to others and to our&s;eives.&mdash;See E&s;&s;ay on education, &s;ect. 56, &amp;c. where are many other valuable ob&s;ervations on this &s;ubject.</P>

<P N="5">5. Tho' &s;ome degree of flattery may be u&s;ed with &s;ucce&s;s in teaching veracity to very young children, as mentioned in &s;ect. 18. of this work, yet I think it &s;hould be u&s;ed very rarely indeed, and only on very important occa&s;ions, le&s;t it &s;hould become a nece&s;&s;ary motive of action, in&s;tead of moral duty; as ob&s;erved in Zoonomia, vol. II. cla&s;s iii. 2.1.8. "The debi|lity
<PB N="131" REF="033601_0132_0FF7A25DB76BB6B0">of the exertion of voluntary efforts prevents the accompli&s;hment of all the great purpo&s;es of life. This often origi|nates from a mi&s;taken education; in which plea&s;ure or vanity is made the immediate motive of action, and not fu|ture advantage, or what is termed duty. This ob&s;ervation is of great value to tho&s;e, who attend to the early education of their own children."</P>
<P>"I have &s;een one or two young mar|ried ladies of fortune, who perpetually became unea&s;y, and believed them&s;elves ill, a week after their arrival in the coun|try; and continued &s;o uniformly during their &s;tay; yet on their return to Lon|don or to Bath immediately lo&s;t all their complaints; and this I ob&s;erved to hap|pen to them repeatedly.

<P N="6">6. Rewards have been given to children to excite their indu&s;try in the performance of particular ta&s;ks; the&s;e are certainly le&s;s eligible motives to action than the fear of di&s;grace, the love of re|putation, and above all the obligations of duty. Where neverthele&s;s the&s;e are thought proper, the kind of rewards re|quires &s;ome attention; which &s;hould con&s;i&s;t of books, or maps, or boxes of colours, or needle ca&s;es: but not of mo|ney, or of trinkets for ornamental dre&s;s, or of a gla&s;s of wine. Where money is given as a reward for indu&s;try in chil|dren, it may &s;eem to them to be the pro|per motive of their actions in&s;tead of re|putation or of duty; and may thus in|duce
<PB N="133" REF="033601_0134_0FF7A2620156E928">the vice of avarice or of extrava|gance. Where a fine cap or gown is given as a reward of diligence, the pride of dre&s;s may be produced, and become their great motive of action, in&s;tead of the love of reputation, or of duty. And la&s;tly, where a gla&s;s of wine is given as a reward for indu&s;try, a child is taught to believe wine to be a mo&s;t valuable ac|qui&s;ition, and a perpetual de&s;ire of it even to intoxication may be the con|&s;equence. I remember a wealthy farm|er, who had two drunken &s;ons, tho' he was a &s;ober man him&s;elf, who told me, that he a&s;cribed this great misfortune to his having occa&s;ionally given them in their early life a cup of ale as a reward for their exertious.&mdash;See Locke on edu|cation, &s;ect. 52, &amp;c.</P>

The &s;ame ob&s;ervation has been made by others, but he adds, "That this might probably ari&s;e from &s;ome trivial circum&s;tance, which deter|mined the inclination of the fortunate &s;tu|dent; and that it is po&s;&s;ible, that the means may &s;ometime be di&s;covered of governing the&s;e incidents, and thus producing a new era in the art of education!"</P>
<P>Similar to this it has often been ob&s;erv|ed, that the fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ions made on our infant minds by accidental di&s;gu&s;t, admi|ration, or flattery, are the frequent cau&s;es of our antipathies or aver&s;ions, and con|tinue through life to bias our affections or mi&s;lead our judgments.

<P>LISPING is a defect of pronuncia|tion occa&s;ioned by children's making u&s;e of the &s;ound of the letter TH &s;ibilant in|&s;tead of the letter S; as in&s;tead of "is it &s;o," they &s;ay "ith it tho." To break this habit they mu&s;t be taught to pronounce the S, by putting the point of the tongue again&s;t the roots of the upper teeth; and not to put it between their teeth as in pro|nouncing the TH. This is ea&s;ily accom|pli&s;hed by putting their own finger again&s;t the point of the tongue, as it comes be|tween their teeth, in attempting to pro|nounce the letter S, and pu&s;hing it back into the mouth.</P>
<P>I once &s;aw a young lady, who after &s;he had left &s;chool, had the habit of u&s;ing oc|ca&s;ionally,
<PB N="137" REF="033601_0138_0FF7A26B67227A78">tho' not con&s;tantly, the gutteral CH in&s;tead of the letter S, which was un|commonly di&s;agreeable to Engli&s;h ears. She corrected this ill habit by being taught, as above, how to place the tongue in pro|nouncing the S, but not without many trials and much attention for &s;ome weeks; as great efforts and pertinacious indu&s;try are required to break any habit, which has been long e&s;iabli&s;hed.</P>
<P>Many children from the difficulty of &s;peaking it are liable to a defective pronun|ciation of the letter R; this in indeed al|mo&s;t general in &s;ome parts of Northumber|land, and is &s;aid to be a &s;ound unknown in China; which obliged the catholic mi&s;|&s;ionaries &s;ent thither by Louis the 14th to change the name of the virgin Mary, from Maria into Malia, or from Mary into Mal|ly. In &s;peaking the letter R the middle of the tongue is made to vibrate with &s;emivo|cal air; whereas in pronouncing L, the edges of the tongue only vibrate; the
<PB N="138" REF="033601_0139_0FF7A26DDF1C3008">Northumberland vernacular R is formed with &s;ibilant air in&s;tead of &s;emivocal air, or differs from the true R, as S differs from Z. Both which &s;hould be explained to tho&s;e children, who have this imperfect pronunciation.</P>
<P>Among the lower orders of the people of London, who are called Cockneys, the letter W is pronounced &s;ibilant like the German W, and not &s;emivocal like our vernacular one; this &s;eems to re&s;emble the &s;ound of V to inattentive ears; and the&s;e Cockneys, are thence &s;uppo&s;ed to u&s;e V in&s;tead of W, as Vomen and Vine, in&s;tead of Women and Wine.

<HEAD>SECTION XXXIII. SQUINTING.</HEAD>
<P>THIS defect of vi&s;ion, which is term|ed &s;trabi&s;mns, may frequently be con|quered in children, if it be attended to early, before it has been long e&s;tabli&s;hed by habit. In this deformity it generally happens, that one eye is better than the other, which induces the child to view ob|jects with the be&s;t eye, and to hide the center of the no&s;e. This greater irritabi|lity of one eye is often occa&s;ioned, I &s;u&s;|pect, in infancy, by tying a bandage for too long a time over an eye, which has happened to be &s;lightly inflamed, and thus decrea&s;ing its power of action by di|&s;u&s;e; in the &s;ame manner the large mu&s;cles of the body become weakened by long in|action; and the right arm is generally
<PB N="143" REF="033601_0144_0FF7A27AF0126580">&s;tronger than the left from its having been more frequently exerci&s;ed.</P>
<P>In this ca&s;e if the be&s;t eye be for an hour or two, or longer, covered every day with gauze &s;tretched upon a circular piece of whale-bone, &s;o as to render the vi&s;ion of this eye as indi&s;tinct as that of the other, the child will naturally turn them both to the &s;ame object, and in a little time the weak eye will become &s;tronger by being u&s;ed, or the &s;trong one weaker by disu&s;e, and the child will cea&s;e to &s;quint.</P>
<P>Another kind of &s;quinting is owing in|tirely to a bad habit, and con&s;i&s;ts in look|ing at objects with one eye only at a time. The owl bends both his eyes upon the ob|ject, which he ob&s;erves; and by thus perpe|tually turning his head to the thing he in|&s;pects, appears to have greater attention to it; and has thence acquired the name of the bird of wi&s;dom. All other birds, I believe, look at objects with one eye only, but it is
<PB N="144" REF="033601_0145_0FF7A27C8207C680">with the eye neare&s;t the object attended to; whereas in this kind of &s;trabi&s;mns the per|&s;on attends to objects with the mo&s;t di&s;tant eye only. This habit has probably been produced, by a cap worn in infancy, which projected forward beyond the head on each &s;ide, like the bluffs of a coach-hor&s;e, &s;o as to make it ea&s;ier for the child, as he lay in his cradle, to view oblique objects with the eye mo&s;t di&s;tant from them; which kind of cap is therefore to be avoided.</P>
<P>A curious ca&s;e of this ill habit of vi&s;ion is related in the Philo&s;. Tran&s;act. vol. 68. by Dr. Darwin; which was relieved by fix|ing a parchment gnomon on the no&s;e of the little boy, which projected about an inch from the ridge of it, and cau&s;ed him for a time to view oblique objects with that eye, which was neare&s;t them.</P>

<P>We are indued with a very accurate &s;en&s;e to di&s;tingui&s;h heat and cold, which
<PB N="151" REF="033601_0152_0FF7A28DD82E4AD8">&s;hould be nicely attended to; as the ex|tremes of both of them are injurious to health, and more &s;o in our &s;leeping than in our waking hours.

A &s;evere continued fro&s;t may may be borne by the &s;trong, who can keep them&s;elves warm by their activity, but is de&s;tructive to the weak and &s;eden|tary. In the year 1795 the weather in January, and in one week of February was uncommonly &s;evere; the &s;ame five weeks in January and February 1796 were uncommonly mild; and it appears by the bills of mortality in London, that 2823 people died in the&s;e five weeks of fro&s;t in 1795; and that only 1471 died in the &s;ame five weeks of mild weather in 1796, which is not much more than half the number.&mdash;See a paper by Dr. Heberden in Philo&s;.

Some mi&s;informed parents have con|ceived, that a hard bed contributes to harden their children in re&s;pect to their bearing cold, and have on that account laid them on &s;traw-mattre&s;&s;es, or on beds with boarded bottoms. The only dif|ference between lying on a &s;oft or hard bed con&s;i&s;ts in this; the weight of the body in the former ca&s;e pre&s;&s;es on a larger &s;urface, and in the latter on a le&s;s; neither of which has any reference to the habits of tenderne&s;s or hardine&s;s in re&s;pect to cold and heat; unle&s;s indeed a feather-bed is &s;o &s;oft, that, as the child &s;inks down in the middle of it, the ri&s;ing edges bend over him, and in part cover him. Perhaps beds made of &s;oft leather properly prepared, and inflated with air, as the Emperor of Germany was &s;aid to u&s;e in camp, might be preferable on this account to feather-beds.</P>
<P>The beds for young children cannot therefore be too &s;oft, however they may
<PB N="153" REF="033601_0154_0FF7A290F5DABA58">contribute to the indolence of grown people provided they do not keep them too warm by bending over them as a|bove de&s;cribed. But the too great hard|ne&s;s of beds is, I believe, frequently inju|rious to the &s;hape of infants by occa&s;ion|ing them to re&s;t on too few parts at a time; which hardens tho&s;e parts by pre&s;|&s;ure, and prevents their proportionate growth. It al&s;o occa&s;ions their &s;leep to be le&s;s &s;ound by the unea&s;ine&s;s it cau&s;es, and in con&s;equence le&s;s refre&s;hing.</P>
<P>The feet and knees and hands of weaker children are liable to become cold in bed in winter, on which account it is more &s;alutary for them to &s;leep with a bed-fellow, rather than alone; as they then naturally put their cold knees or hands to their companion in bed, and thus frequently prevent rheu|matic, and other inflammatory di&s;ea&s;es of fatal event. For the &s;ame rea&s;on it is better for a new born infant to &s;leep
<PB N="154" REF="033601_0155_0FF7A292969C0660">with its mother in winter, or with a young nur&s;e, than in a &s;olitary crib by her bed-&s;ide; unle&s;s the artificial warmth of the room be more nicely graduated, than is commonly done.</P>
<P>For the &s;ame rea&s;on, where children are too feeble from illne&s;s, a fire &s;hould be allowed in their bed-chamber in cold weather; as the cold air is otherwi&s;e injurious to their lungs, which cannot be clothed &s;o as to prevent the contact of of the air, like the other parts of the bo|dy; a fire contributes al&s;o to ventilate a room, and to circulate the air in it, and thence to render it more &s;alutary; but it &s;hould not warm it to more than 60 or 65 degrees, that its temperature may not differ too much from that of the external atmo&s;phere; as tho&s;e, who are kept generally too warm, are liable to take cold, at every bla&s;t of air, not from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> degree of cold, to which they hap|pen

<P>The univer&s;al analogy derived from other animals, which produce a feeble offspring, evinces the truth of this doc|trine, both in re&s;pect to the &s;oftne&s;s, and the due degree of warmth of their beds: Birds line the ne&s;ts for their young with feathers; the eider duck, and the rabbit, pluck the down from their own brea&s;ts to increa&s;e the &s;oftne&s;s of the beds for their tender offspring; and brood them with their wings, or cla&s;p them to their bo&s;oms for the &s;ake of warmth.</P>
<P>The number of hours required for &s;alutary &s;leep is greater for younger chil|dren, than for tho&s;e more advanced; as during our progre&s;s through life we ac|quire greater facility in u&s;ing our volun|tary power, and recruit it in le&s;s time when exhau&s;ted. The younger cla&s;&s;es

<P>MILK is the food de&s;igned by na|ture for young animals, and &s;hould be gi|ven them in its recent &s;tate. As the cream is the mo&s;t nouri&s;hing part of the milk, and is ea&s;ier of dige&s;tion than the coagulable or chee&s;y part; and as milk con&s;titutes a principal portion of the ali|ment of children; to take off the cream once, or even twice, as is practi&s;ed in &s;ome boarding &s;chools, before it is given to the children, is a &s;hameful circum&s;tance of par&s;imony, and very injurious to their healths.&mdash;See &s;ect. xxx, on puni&s;hments.</P>
<P>Nor &s;hould the milk given to children be long kept in a boiling heat; becau&s;e much of its fragrant oil is then evaporated,
<PB N="158" REF="033601_0159_0FF7A29CF4E1E720">as is evident from the fine odour of the &s;team of it, when taken from the fire; and its further deterioration from long boiling is &s;hewn by its then inducing con&s;tipation, which is contrary to its effect in its recent and natural &s;tate.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s even new milk does not always agree with children, after they have pa&s;&s;ed the years of infancy. For milk ta|ken into the &s;tomach mu&s;t be always pre|viou&s;ly curdled or coagulated, before it can be dige&s;ted, or converted into nou|ri&s;hment: Hence milk is always found curdled in the &s;tomachs of calves, and the acid juice of their &s;tomachs is u&s;ed to co|agulate their milk in the proce&s;s of chee&s;e|making: Now the &s;tomachs of young chil|dren abound more with this acid juice than in their riper years, and when a &s;ufficient quantity of it is not produced for the pur|po&s;e of curdling the milk, which they drink, it is liable to di&s;agree.</P>
<P><PB N="159" REF="033601_0160_0FF7A29E889FA828">
To the&s;e few therefore, who&s;e &s;to|machs do not ea&s;ily dige&s;t the coagulable part of milk, other fluid &s;ood &s;hould be al|lowed to breakfa&s;t, as gruel, or tea with cream and &s;ugar in it, and with bread and butter; and to &s;upper, a &s;lice of cold meat, or of chee&s;e, or tart, or bread and butter, with &s;mall beer or water for drink; but it is probable, that milk might be made to agree with all &s;tomachs, if it was previous|ly curdled by rennet, as I have often re|commended with &s;ucce&s;s to elderly per|&s;ons; or by letting it &s;tand, till it becomes &s;pontaneou&s;ly &s;our like buttermilk, as is the cu&s;tom of the inferior people of Scot|land; except neverthele&s;s where the di&s;|ta&s;te of the child is owing to prejudice or caprice, which is then incurable but by time.</P>
<P>For dinner animal food plain dre&s;&s;ed, with vegetables or bread, and pudding of wheat flour, milk, and eggs, with &s;ugar or butter, are more nouri&s;hing than vegetable

Wheat flour contains more nutriment than that of rice, or bar|ley, or oats; as it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es more &s;tarch in proportion to its bulk, and a gluten ap|proaching to animal matter. But much &s;alt or &s;pice &s;hould not be allowed in the diet of children, as they are certainly un|whole&s;ome by inducing a weakne&s;s of the capillary and ab&s;orbent &s;y&s;tems of ve&s;&s;els in con&s;equence of their too great &s;timulus, and contain no nouri&s;hment.</P>
<P>As butter and &s;ugar are perhaps the mo&s;t nutritive of animal and vegetable &s;ub&s;tances, they may be more ea&s;ily taken to exce&s;s; on which account &s;ome mi&s;taken parents have totally prohibited the u&s;e of them; which is a great di&s;advantage to weaker children, who require more nutri|tive diet in le&s;s bulk than &s;tronger ones.</P>
<P>For the drink of the more robu&s;t chil|dren water is preferable, and for the weak|er ones, &s;mall beer; but in this, as well as
<PB N="161" REF="033601_0162_0FF7A2A39827EA08">in the choice of &s;olid food, their palates &s;hould be con&s;ulted; for the nice di&s;cern|ment of this &s;en&s;e is be&s;towed on us by na|ture to di&s;tingui&s;h, what the &s;tomach can be&s;t dige&s;t. It &s;hould however be ob&s;erv|ed, that in artificial viands the ta&s;te cannot di&s;tingui&s;h, what is unwhole&s;ome; as &s;ugar may be mixed with ar&s;enic. So in the drinking of fermented liquors, as ale or wine, which are chemical productions, the palate is not to be con&s;ulted; a gla&s;s of mere wine &s;hould never be given to chil|dren, as it injures their tender &s;tomachs like a gla&s;s of brandy or rum or gin to a grown per&s;on; and induces tho&s;e di&s;ea&s;es, which it is often erroneou&s;ly given to pre|vent; as weakne&s;s of dige&s;tion, with the production of worms in con&s;equence. Wine neverthele&s;s diluted with thrice its quantity of water may be allowed, if re|quired, in&s;tead of &s;mall beer; or ale or cider diluted with thrice their quantities of water.</P>
<P><PB N="162" REF="033601_0163_0FF7A2A53503DE70">
Ripe fruits, or fruit pies, are peculiar|ly &s;erviceable to the con&s;titutions of chil|dren, as well as agreeable to their palates; as they are known to prevent biliary con|cretions, and con&s;equent jaundice; and on the &s;ame account to render the &s;kin clear|er and fairer, as well as to counteract the tendency to putrid di&s;ea&s;es. The&s;e &s;hould therefore be allowed to children at all &s;ea|&s;ons; and may either occa&s;ionally con&s;ti|tute a part of their diet; or may be recom|mended to them, when they lay out part of their pocket-money with huck&s;ters, in preference to &s;eed-cakes, gingerbread, or &s;ugar-plumbs; the former of which are generally made of bad flour deteriorated by &s;pice; and the latter are liable to be co|loured with gamboge, vermillion, verdi|grea&s;e, or other noxious drugs.</P>
<P>Too long fa&s;ting, or food of le&s;s nou|ri&s;hment than they have been accu&s;tomed to, are peculiarly injurious to children; as they weaken their power of dige&s;tion, im|pair
<PB N="163" REF="033601_0164_0FF7A2AA08A958A0">their &s;trength, and impede their growth. The children of the inferior poor, and of families, which have adopted &s;ome ill-advi&s;ed rules of ab&s;temious diet, are frequently &s;tarved into the &s;crophula, and become pale-faced and bloated, owing to deficiency of the quantity of blood, and to want of &s;ufficient &s;timulus to the ab&s;orb|ent &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>If young people are thought to be too corpulent, a diminution of food with an increa&s;e of exerci&s;e, when they have ob|tained their full growth, may be u&s;ed with advantage; but even then not without cau|tion. Since young ladies, after they have left &s;chool, who by ill advice u&s;e too great ab&s;tinence, are liable to become pale and emaciated, and to fall into univer&s;al debi|lity; which remains through a di&s;ea&s;ed and comfortle&s;s life.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION XXXVIII. ECONOMY.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. A DUE regard to the prudent ex|penditure of their money, a proper care of their clothes, and a par&s;imonious atten|tion to the lap&s;e of time, &s;hould be incul|cated into the minds of young ladies. To effect the&s;e purpo&s;es one efficacious me|thod, where the u&s;ual exhortations fail, may be to &s;uffer their imprudence to pro|duce &s;ome inconvenience to them&s;elves; which they &s;hould be permitted to feel to a proper degree.</P>
<P>Thus a profu&s;e unnece&s;&s;ary expendi|ture of their pocket money will &s;hortly in|duce poverty; which &s;hould by no means be alleviated by a fre&s;h &s;upply of money; till the inconvenience produced has effect|ed
<PB N="165" REF="033601_0166_0FF7A2AD531EED90">a conviction of the impropriety of their conduct. Except when the expenditure has been made for &s;ome laudable purpo&s;e, and then no time &s;hould be lo&s;t in re&s;tor|ing the power of repeating it.</P>
<P>The &s;ame mean may be u&s;ed in re&s;|pect to their omi&s;&s;ion to take care of their clothes; they &s;hould find the nece&s;&s;ity of repairing them with their own hands, or of foregoing &s;ome vi&s;iting amu&s;ements, till new ones can be procured; that thus the con&s;equent inconvenience may teach them economy, if they are otherwi&s;e too inat|tentive to the u&s;ual admonitions on the&s;e &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>In re&s;pect to the economy of time the hours of amu&s;ement and of exerci&s;e &s;hould be regularly counted; and the length of time young ladies employ in dre&s;&s;ing &s;hould be nicely attended to; as in adult life the hours con&s;umed at the toilet of &s;ome ladies is perfectly ridiculous, and de|tains
<PB N="166" REF="033601_0167_0FF7A2B019D55F70">them from more important duties. Perhaps a &s;tated time might be allowed the young ladies for adju&s;ting the articles of their dre&s;s, that they might acquire a habit of di&s;po&s;ing them with neatne&s;s, ta&s;te, and elegance, and yet with expedition.</P>
<P N="2">2. Men are generally trained from their early years to the bu&s;ine&s;s or profe&s;|&s;ion, in which they are afterwards to en|gage; but it mo&s;t frequently happens to ladies, that tho' de&s;tined to the &s;uperin|tendance of a future family, they receive &s;carcely any previous in&s;truction; but be|gin this important office with a profound ignorance of the value of money, and of the proper application of the things, which &s;urround them.</P>
<P>Many young ladies de&s;titute of mo|thers, and without a home, are continued at &s;chool to a later age; &s;uch &s;hould be formed into a cla&s;s, and properly in&s;truct|ed in dome&s;tic economy; each of them
<PB N="167" REF="033601_0168_0FF7A2B2958A7338">&s;uperintending the bu&s;ine&s;s of the family, a week or a month by turns; not only pro|viding for the table, and directing the cookery, but they &s;hould al&s;o be taught other parts of dome&s;tic employment, as cutting out linens, and making them up with plain and &s;trong needle work, either for their own families, or to be given as clothing for nece&s;&s;itous infants or mothers.</P>
<P>Such an addition of dome&s;tic know|ledge and benevolent indu&s;try to orna|mental accompli&s;hments would give the &s;chool, that procures it, a decided advan|tage over other &s;chools, which have no &s;uch in&s;titution.</P>

<HEAD>SECTION XXXIX. SCHOOL-EDUCATION.</HEAD>
<P>THE advantages of a &s;chool-educa|tion, where twenty or thirty children are properly in&s;tructed, over that in a private family are derived from &s;everal &s;ources. Fir&s;t, it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that almo&s;t all our exertions in early life are owing to our imitating others; in child|hood we are mo&s;t liable to imitate the actions of tho&s;e, who are &s;omewhat old|er than our&s;elves; and in manhood, of tho&s;e who are in &s;omewhat higher life; whence the general prevalence of fa|&s;hion in dre&s;s and manners. Now there are more examples to cau&s;e imitative activity in well conducted &s;chools, and the children in con&s;equence become more active in the pur&s;uit of their &s;tu|dies,
<PB N="169" REF="033601_0170_0FF7A2B69EB22B68">and in the acquirement of their ac|compli&s;hments.</P>
<P>It may be added, that not only chil|dren, before they have acquired the u&s;e of rea&s;on or voluntary deliberation, but that the greate&s;t part of adult mankind learn all the common arts of life by imi|tating others; and that even dumb creatures &s;eem capable of acquiring knowledge with greater facility by imi|tating each other, than by any methods, by which we can teach them. Thus dogs, when they are &s;ick, learn of each other to eat gra&s;s as an emetic; and cats to moi&s;ten their paws for the purpo&s;e of wa&s;hing their faces. And the readie&s;t way to in&s;truct all brute animals is by practi&s;ing them with others of the &s;ame &s;pecies; which have already learnt the arts, we wi&s;h them to acquire, as ex|plained in Zoonomia, vol. I. &s;ect. 22.3.</P>
<P><PB N="170" REF="033601_0171_0FF7A2B84B298370">
A &s;econd advantage of &s;chools, when well conducted, is that children often take plea&s;ure in teaching each other, in|&s;omuch that at boy's &s;chools I have of|ten ob&s;erved, that the lower cla&s;&s;es have learnt more from their &s;chool-fellows of the higher cla&s;&s;es, than even from their ma&s;ters; which has &s;ometimes ari&s;en from the friend&s;hip, or vanity of the el|der boy, and &s;ometimes from the &s;olicita|tion of the lower one; but has in all ca&s;es been advantageous to both of them.</P>
<P>A third &s;uperiority of &s;chool educa|tion ari&s;es from an emulation, which na|turally exi&s;ts, where many pur&s;ue the &s;ame &s;tudies, but which &s;hould not be encouraged by rewards or degradations; as it then may degenerate into envy or hatred; but &s;hould in general be left in|tirely to its own operation; as mention|ed in &s;ect. xxx.</P>
<P>A fourth advantage of &s;chool-educa|tion is from the children acquiring a
<PB N="171" REF="033601_0172_0FF7A2BCB5912A50">kind of practical phy&s;iognomy; which renders them more intelligent, and more intere&s;ting companions; and is of great|er con&s;equence in our pa&s;&s;age through life, than almo&s;t any &s;ingle accompli&s;h|ment, as explained in &s;ect. vi. and &s;ect. xxiv. of this work.</P>
<P>Fifthly, where languages are learnt by conver&s;ation, as is generally practi&s;ed in teaching the French language, a &s;chool-education properly conducted, is much &s;uperior to that of a governe&s;s in a private family. And languages are &s;o much ea&s;ier taught to children by con|ver&s;ation than by the ab&s;tract rules of grammar, that Mr. Locke is &s;olicitous to have the latin and greek languages taught by conver&s;ation in boys' &s;chools; and thinks the time of learning words might thus be much &s;hortened, which now occu|pies &s;even or eight years; part of which might be much better employed in acquir|ing the knowledge of things.</P>
<P><PB N="172" REF="033601_0173_0FF7A2BE47A65FC0">
The Philo&s;opher, who de&s;pi&s;ing the goods of fortune &s;aid, "he was rich, though he carried about with him every thing, which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed," meant to a&s;&s;ert, that &s;trength of mind joined with &s;trength of body, were &s;uperior to any other advan|tages of life. A good education furni&s;hes us with this ine&s;timable trea&s;ure; it ac|companies us at home, travels with us a|broad; delights us in &s;olitude, graces us in &s;ociety; comforts us in misfortune, guards us in pro&s;perity; contributes to the happine&s;s of others, and en&s;ures our own.</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>CORNELIA, daughter of Scipio Africanus, and mother of the Gracchi, was not more di&s;tingui&s;hed by the Nobility of her rank, than by the lu&s;tre of tho&s;e vir|tues which adorned her character&mdash;a mo&s;t plea&s;ing and amiable trait of which &s;hines in that little incident recorded to her im|mortal honour. A Lady of Ionia coming one day to vi&s;it her, impatiently expected to be &s;hewn the &s;plendor and magnificence of her toilette, which &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed, from her rank and fortune, to be very &s;uperb. The illu&s;trious Roman prolonged the con|ver&s;ation till her children were at hand, and then introducing them to her vi&s;itor&mdash;"The&s;e, &s;ays &s;he, are my jewels."</P>
<P><PB N="200" REF="033601_0192_0FF7A2E495B62AA0">
The writer of the&s;e Letters has &s;o great a veneration for the dome&s;tic character of this Lady, that &s;he thinks &s;he cannot do better than give them to the public, under the &s;ignature of Cornelia. And whatever their other defects may be, they have this at lea&s;t to recommend them, that the &s;ame &s;entiments of maternal tenderne&s;s which influenced the Roman Matron, gave ri&s;e to the&s;e epi&s;tles, and prompted a fond Mo|ther to become an Author.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER I.</HEAD>
<P>A DESIRE of happine&s;s is the fir&s;t propen&s;ity of the heart.&mdash;It is born with us, and to attempt its &s;uppre&s;&s;ion were e|qually fruitle&s;s and wrong; for the Author of Nature has done nothing in vain, and the happine&s;s he has imprinted on the mind &s;o clear an idea of, has &s;omewhere an exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>Hitherto you have obeyed the impul&s;e of nature in the artle&s;s pur&s;uits of child|hood; but the time is at hand, when this &s;weet tranquillity will be interrupted by the bu&s;tle of the world, which will not longer permit you to repo&s;e in the &s;imple amu&s;ements of dre&s;&s;ing dolls, pur&s;uing butterflies, or plucking, dai&s;ies. Sweet
<PB N="202" REF="033601_0194_0FF7A3C06856B4B8">dear delights of innocence: on which, as you climb the rugged heights of life, you will look back with fond regret.</P>
<P>But we are not born for our&s;elves a|lone; and therefore have duties to per|form, obligations to di&s;charge, and diffi|culties to encounter; in the cour&s;e of which, many a &s;evere check is given to this happine&s;s which we all &s;o ardently &s;eek; yet the de&s;ire of it will even acquire &s;trength by the repul&s;e, and there was ne|ver yet a wretch who had found it dimi|ni&s;hed by misfortune. I wi&s;h the &s;ucce&s;s of this pa&s;&s;ion could be &s;hewn as demon|&s;trable as its exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>But the truth is, all mankind are run|ning after the &s;ame object, though in &s;uch oppo&s;ite directions, that if it were not for their concurrent te&s;timony, it would be &s;carcely credible that they had each the &s;ame view. Yet it is the fate of mo&s;t of them to &s;it down at la&s;t, in the very &s;ame
<PB N="203" REF="033601_0195_0FF77EBC45D89500">di&s;po&s;ition which Solomon was in when he complained, rather peevi&s;hly it mu&s;t be owned, that all was vanity and vexation of &s;pirit. Man walks indeed in a vain &s;ha|dow, and 'tis pitiable to reflect that a being of &s;o tran&s;ient a duration &s;hould yet wa&s;te the trifling portion of time allotted him in vain and fruitle&s;s pur&s;uits, and after all the &s;chemes of the &s;anguine, and the la|bours of the active, to find the de&s;ired at|tainment as far off as ever.</P>
<P>But this has been the ca&s;e of millions, and I am afraid will continue to be &s;o, at lea&s;t till we are unanimous in deciding on that grand point wherein this good, of which we have all &s;o high an idea, con|&s;i&s;ts: an agreement from which alas, we are at the farthe&s;t di&s;tance imaginable. And here, my deare&s;t girls, lies the whole of the mi&s;take. The Creator has not been wanting to provide a happine&s;s exalted as the mind it&s;elf can conceive; but man him&s;elf errs in the pur&s;uit of it; &s;ome
<PB N="204" REF="033601_0196_0FF77EBFDA831FE8">placing it in riches, &s;ome in power, &s;carce|ly one in an age &s;uppo&s;ing it to be where it really is&mdash;in the practice of virtue.</P>
<P>But while the human heart is &s;et on acquirements, in which it can find no &s;a|tisfaction if attained, the &s;pan of life mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be pa&s;&s;ed in re&s;tle&s;s anxieties and melancholy di&s;appointment. It was the aim of philo&s;ophy, to draw ju&s;t e&s;ti|mates of things, and to prevent its pupils from being dazzled with the &s;plendor of wealth and power; it taught that the &s;o|vereign good was to be found in rectitude of will. It would be a &s;hame for us to be at a lo&s;s on &s;uch an important &s;ubject, who have received le&s;&s;ons from a much better ma&s;ter than ever gave lectures in the &s;chools of Athens.</P>
<P>Re&s;t a&s;&s;ured that in the exerci&s;e of &s;o|cial and religious duties, the mind will find her &s;olid happine&s;s. Wandering in re&s;t|le&s;s &s;earch, like Noah's dove, 'tis here &s;he
<PB N="205" REF="033601_0197_0FF7A2EDDEF074B8">finds at length the welcome olive, the branch who&s;e verdure blooms for immor|tality. Should you doubt the a&s;&s;ertion, be prevailed on at lea&s;t to try the experi|ment.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER II.</HEAD>
<P>PLEASURE has &s;omething &s;o allur|ing in the very name, that it is not &s;ur|pri&s;ing it finds &s;o great a number of vota|ries. On no account would I have you in&s;en&s;ible to its attractions, but rather lead you to its flowery paths, and conduct you to the mo&s;t refined delights. The&s;e how|ever you can never obtain, except you are guided in the choice by ta&s;te and judg|ment. A ta&s;te in plea&s;ure is nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;election of &s;uch as are above the en|quiries of the vulgar, &s;uitable to delicate and refined minds, and corre&s;pondent to the noble&s;t &s;entiments; of cour&s;e depend|ant more on intellectual, than on corporeal faculties. Ta&s;te never fails to reject what|ever is gro&s;s and &s;en&s;ual; yet even among the more re&s;ined plea&s;ures, a &s;ound judg|ment is wanted, to di&s;criminate the &s;olid
<PB N="207" REF="033601_0199_0FF7A2F442A546D0">and rational, from the frivolous and fa&s;ti|dious. The elegant hand of fa&s;hionable di&s;&s;ipation has often given a poli&s;h to what, in its own nature, can never de&s;erve the name of plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>Under this head mu&s;t be comprehend|ed the various &s;pecies of fa&s;hionable amu&s;e|ments, which are injurious either to health or fortune. One would &s;carcely &s;uppo&s;e &s;uch pur&s;uits as the&s;e &s;hould ever be dig|nified with the name of plea&s;ure. Yet when numbers are daily &s;een hazarding, not only extravagant &s;ums, but peace of mind al&s;o, at the gaming-table&mdash;When the order of nature is inverted, and the re|fre&s;hments of repo&s;e are bartered for mid|night routs, we mu&s;t conclude that &s;uch valuable &s;acrifices are not made but with the expectation of &s;ome &s;upreme plea&s;ure to reward them: how &s;eldom &s;uch rewards are found, can be&s;t be determined by the te&s;timony of the di&s;&s;ipated and gay, who after they have wa&s;ted the mo&s;t valuable
<PB N="208" REF="033601_0200_0FF7A2F5D29AAE18">ble&s;&s;ings of life, as time, health, &s;pirits, &amp;c. will generally confe&s;s that they have never found the &s;atisfactions they &s;ought after.</P>
<P>To be able to dive&s;t real enjoyment from the fal&s;e glo&s;&s;es the world has put up|on it, is a piece of wi&s;dom becoming a philo&s;opher; but it is a piece of wi&s;dom, you my dear girls, mu&s;t al&s;o acquire, if you expect to be happy. Fa&s;hion has ar|rogated to it&s;elf the prerogative of fixing the criterion of plea&s;ure; but fa&s;hion is often a dangerous director, and is at be&s;t an imperfect one; for who has a power of effectually bia&s;&s;ing the natural di&s;po&s;ition of another; if therefore what is called amu&s;ement be not agreeable to the real turn of the mind, it cea&s;es to be viewed in that light, and can only be con&s;idered as an irk&s;ome conformity to the ta&s;tes of others.</P>
<P>Yet, abject as &s;uch a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion un|doubtedly is, there are thou&s;ands who vo|luntarily
<PB N="209" REF="033601_0201_0FF7A2F75EF848A0">yield to it who are content to live, move, and act, not as they like them|&s;elves, but as the polite world thinks fit to dictate. I am no advocate for affected &s;in|gularity in things merely indifferent; but when the idol fa&s;hion breaks in upon the rules of virtue, as it too often does, or the true enjoyment of life, this is &s;o mean a &s;lavery that a rational being might be ex|pected to de&s;pi&s;e it.</P>
<P>When therefore rea&s;on and religion have given the clue to your plea&s;ures, re|&s;olve always to have them of your own chu&s;ing, and not of other people's. The &s;anction of numbers is the cau&s;e that draws youth from virtue and happine&s;s: rea&s;on, when aided by a proper education, would, if left to her&s;elf, point out the way to both.</P>
<P>There are plea&s;ures, my dear girls, to be met with in this journey of life, pure and &s;ublime ones too, if we look for them through the medium of unvitiated ta&s;le.
<PB N="210" REF="033601_0202_0FF7A2F8EDE69C40">Did you ever di&s;charge a &s;ocial duty, but upon looking into your heart, you there perceived a glow of &s;atisfaction? But if you aim at more exalted, more rapturous &s;en&s;ations, give full &s;cope to the impul&s;es of benevolence; try what it is to heal the broken-hearted; diffu&s;e joy through the man&s;ions of &s;orrow, and re&s;cue merit from the pre&s;&s;ure of indigence and misfortune. &mdash;The&s;e employments are capable of yielding plea&s;ures &s;uitable to the mo&s;t ex|alted capacities, boundle&s;s as the mo&s;t &s;an|guine imagination can paint them.</P>
<P>But if &s;o va&s;t a multitude have erred in the pur&s;uit of plea&s;ure, through levity, not an incon&s;iderable number, of a very oppo|&s;ite temper, are at equally as great a di&s;|tance from it: the&s;e are the moro&s;e and cynical, who will not conde&s;cend to the &s;ober &s;atisfactions that are to be found in a dome&s;tic circle, where the &s;ocial affections are cultivated: if the gay and volatile mi&s;|take the nature of plea&s;ure, the&s;e &s;eem to
<PB N="211" REF="033601_0203_0FF7A2FC98733760">que&s;tion its very exi&s;tence, and pa&s;s thro' life without &s;tooping to pick up even one of the fair blo&s;&s;oms which nature has &s;cat|tered in the way.</P>
<P>Ever be your hearts open to the &s;weet emotions of &s;ocial love, and you will not have cau&s;e to complain that the path of human life affords nothing but briars and thorns.</P>
<P>Nor is it from the relative duties alone we can derive happine&s;s; the amu&s;ing, the intere&s;ting book of nature is open to all who can read it: here you meet with eternal variety, order, and beauty; a thou|&s;and charms await the mind which po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a ta&s;te for &s;imple plea&s;ures; to &s;uch the whole creation is a boundle&s;s &s;ource of rational amu&s;ements. Happy, ineffably happy, they who can be plea&s;ed with art|le&s;s nature, and contemplate, with delight, the noble imagery with which &s;he abounds. For my part, I &s;hould de&s;ire no greater
<PB N="212" REF="033601_0204_0FF7A2FF0BB91940">proof of the purity and elegance of your ta&s;te, than to hear you &s;peak in raptures of the graceful foliage of a wood, the beauty of a lawn, or any of tho&s;e charming rural &s;cenes which are &s;o often over-looked, for the far le&s;s nobler productions of art.</P>
<P>E&s;teem me ever the mo&s;t affectionate of your friends.</P>

<P>EVERY one knows that human life is expo&s;ed to various mi&s;eries; but every one does not know, at lea&s;t does not con|&s;ider, that the far greater part of the&s;e mi|&s;eries &s;pring from the pa&s;&s;ions: yet the pa&s;&s;ions, you reply, are implanted in us by nature&mdash;we cannot eradicate them.</P>
<P>That is true; you cannot eradicate the pa&s;&s;ions, nor is it expedient you &s;hould; for as we are the workman&s;hip of Infinite Wi&s;dom, &s;o doubtle&s;sly the propen&s;ities He has formed us with, are in them&s;elves very good; but then their good or ill ten|dency mu&s;t be determined by this &s;ingle que&s;tion, Whether they govern us, or we govern them? In the latter ca&s;e they re|&s;emble tho&s;e &s;alutary breezes, which waft health and &s;weetne&s;s on their wings: in
<PB N="214" REF="033601_0206_0FF7A303222D8300">the former they may be compared to cer|tain hurricanes, which tear up all before them, and deform the beauteous a&s;pect of the mo&s;t luxuriant climates. There is more felicity to be found in the world than is often &s;uppo&s;ed; but never let us pretend to look for it before we have &s;i|lenced the pa&s;&s;ions; the perpetual con|tention we mu&s;t have with them will el&s;e interrupt our &s;ucce&s;sful &s;earch.</P>
<P>Pride, my dear girls, is a vice that &s;prings up in the mind, almo&s;t without her attending to it: its characters are an im|moderate &s;elf-love, conceitedne&s;s, and ar|rogance, with a profound contempt of every other per&s;on; ever in&s;atiable in its de&s;ire of re&s;pect, extremely &s;u&s;ceptible of the &s;lighte&s;t affronts, and jealous of the lea&s;t tribute of applau&s;e paid to another. Per&s;ons of this ca&s;t cannot in the nature of things be happy, as they may be &s;aid to live in a &s;tate of ho&s;tility with all the world; like I&s;hmael, they have their hands again&s;t
<PB N="215" REF="033601_0207_0FF7A3059B2F8C88">every man, and every man's hand is again&s;t them.</P>
<P>Ambition condemns its wretched vo|tary to forego the &s;weets of content and pre|&s;ent ea&s;e, for the unea&s;y dreams of rank and power. It is happy for the world when fate denies to the ambitious that power to which their de&s;ires are perpetu|ally a&s;piring. Innumerable are the hor|rid deeds, which the hi&s;toric page records, that have been perpetrated by the impul&s;e of this re&s;tle&s;s pa&s;&s;ion; yet if in pity to mankind, its direful effects are re&s;trained, &s;till the bo&s;om where it rages mu&s;t be a prey to inexpre&s;&s;ible agonies.</P>
<P>Envy is a natural attendant on pride and ambition: it has very aptly been com|pared to a vulture preying on the vitals, and there could not po&s;&s;ibly have been de|vi&s;ed a more expre&s;&s;ive &s;imilitude. That mind which is capable of regarding with the lea&s;t degree of regret, the more fortu|nate
<PB N="216" REF="033601_0208_0FF7A30817FEE608">acquirements of another as a per|petual &s;ource of di&s;quietude and mu&s;t ever pine beneath the inexpre&s;&s;ible mi&s;ery, which is both the con&s;equence and the pu|ni&s;hment of &s;o ba&s;e a propen&s;ity. As en|vy is the meane&s;t of all the pa&s;&s;ions, &s;o in its own nature it is the mo&s;t oppo&s;ite to happine&s;s.</P>
<P>Covetou&s;ne&s;s is a vice that ab&s;orbs eve|ry finer feeling of the &s;oul. Whatever &s;ordid &s;atisfaction the mi&s;er may feel in a|ma&s;&s;ing his trea&s;ures, yet the cares which unavoidably attend it, and the &s;olicitude the pre&s;ervation of it demands, more than balance the &s;elfi&s;h gratification. He knows nothing of the &s;weet emotions of charity and benevolence, and mu&s;t be ever a &s;tran|ger to the noble &s;en&s;ations they excite.&mdash;It is well if the &s;ugge&s;tions of his bound|le&s;s avarice do not prompt him beyond the bounds of integrity. The hone&s;ty of a covetous per&s;on can be but doubtful at the be&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="217" REF="033601_0209_0FF7A309A5B050C0">
A revengeful di&s;po&s;ition is as dreadful to &s;ociety as burden&s;ome to it&s;elf: it is the whirlwind of the &s;oul, which under its dominion re&s;embles a fury of the in|fernal regions. What &s;ad cata&s;trophes have been effected by revenge! what in|expre&s;&s;ible torment overwhelms the heart, where that dreadful venom operates!</P>
<P>It is ea&s;y to perceive, by the &s;lighte&s;t glance, that every one of the pa&s;&s;ions here enumerated are totally de&s;tructive of peace: there can be no &s;uch thing as tranquillity in the brea&s;t which they inhabit. Let it, then, be the care of my deare&s;t girls, to guard again&s;t the fatal a&s;cendancy of either of them. There cannot be a more lamen|table object than a human being who &s;ub|mits to become the &s;port of pa&s;&s;ions: a barque in a &s;torm, driven by winds, and &s;hattered by the tempe&s;t, exhibits but a faint picture of &s;uch a wretch, who&s;e days pa&s;s in continual angui&s;h; he looks for peace, but finds de&s;pair; ca&s;ts oblique re|flections
<PB N="218" REF="033601_0210_0FF7A30B36D53758">on the wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s of Providence; di&s;tru&s;ts his attributes; cuff|es his own being and dies if po&s;&s;ible more wretched than he lived.</P>
<P>The infinitely wi&s;e and good Creator &s;aw the abundant evil that would accrue to mankind from the degeneracy of the pa&s;|&s;ions, and therefore in his goodne&s;s deter|mined at an appointed time to promulgate a religion, the aim of which &s;hould be to regulate the pa&s;&s;ions, and direct them to their proper channel; &s;uch is the Chri&s;|tian revelation; in its ends and nature an antidote to moral evil.</P>
<P>Perhaps the natural pa&s;&s;ions of the hu|man mind may be reduced to two&mdash;the love of plea&s;ure and the love of prai&s;e; and from the corruptions of the&s;e may be traced every irregular affection of the heart&mdash;when men no longer knew the true &s;ource from whence to look for happine&s;s, or approbation, it is not much wonder it
<PB N="219" REF="033601_0211_0FF7A30EDBBF0700">&s;hould be &s;ought in power, riches and pre|eminence; not that the love of the&s;e &s;hould branch into &s;elf-love, vain glory, and all the other evil pa&s;&s;ions, which cau&s;e &s;o much mi&s;ery in the world.</P>
<P>The regulation of the heart and its de|&s;ires, is a point then of the utmo&s;t impor|tance, &s;ince on it depends your pre&s;ent peace and eternal glory. "Keep thy heart with all diligence, for out of it are the i&s;&s;ues of life." And when you have repelled the approach of any pa&s;&s;ion, guard &s;till more effectually again&s;t its en|trance, by endeavouring to e&s;tabli&s;h in your mind the contrary virtue;&mdash;as for in|&s;tance, &s;ubdue pride and cheri&s;h humility; guard again&s;t the de&s;ire of power and rich|es, by attaining that poverty of &s;pirit which is content with little, and de&s;ires no ap|plau&s;e but that of Heaven.</P>
<P>Never lo&s;e &s;ight of this truth&mdash;that there is no happine&s;s adequate to the ca|pacities
<PB N="220" REF="033601_0212_0FF7A311603842B0">of the human &s;oul, but what is found in the exerci&s;e of piety and virtue; nor any prai&s;e worthy her regard, but what re&s;ults immediately therefrom.</P>

<P>THE mo&s;t glorious conque&s;t you can po&s;&s;ibly obtain is that of your&s;elves. So|lomon was of opinion, that he who could govern his own &s;pirit, had attained a much higher point of dominion, than if he &s;hould rule a kingdom. It is certainly much ea&s;ier to give wi&s;e and upright laws to others, than to obey them our&s;elves; and when you can controul your own in|clination, you will have learned the whole e&s;&s;ence of moral philo&s;ophy.</P>
<P>But a negative virtue is not all that is to be attained, although thou&s;ands content with it, maintain through life the character of good &s;ort of people.&mdash;The epithet, however, contains no very high eulogium, tho&s;e good kind of folks &s;eldom ri&s;e above a mediocrity in goodne&s;s. It certainly is
<PB N="222" REF="033601_0214_0FF7A315691833E0">not &s;ufficient to ab&s;tain from evil, a chri&s;|tian mu&s;t be di&s;tingui&s;hed by active virtue.</P>
<P>The Chri&s;tian religion is a beautiful comment on the moral law. The prie&s;t who pa&s;&s;ed by the wounded Jew, was, for aught we are told to the contrary, a very good &s;ort of man, and had &s;ome &s;entiments of compa&s;&s;ion, for he went and <HI>looked</HI> on the poor creature, and no doubt kindly <HI>wi&s;hed</HI> it had been in his power to relieve him; but the good, the benevolent Sama|ritan, was the generous, <HI>active</HI> friend, who&s;e character will never be read without being admired. The lawyer al&s;o po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a tolerable &s;hare of negative merit, having always kept the commandments; yet &s;ays our Saviour, thou lacke&s;t one thing&mdash;that heroic benevolence, which di&s;regards all attention to &s;elfi&s;h gratification, in the no|ble ardour with which it contributes to the nece&s;&s;ities of mankind.</P>
<P>The&s;e in&s;tances are fine illu&s;trations of the Mo&s;aic di&s;pen&s;ation, and eminently
<PB N="223" REF="033601_0215_0FF7A317EB49E0F0">tend to exalt human nature to the highe&s;t po&s;&s;ible perfection. It is not enough, &s;ay the go&s;pel tenets, that ye refrain from ac|tual violence to any one&mdash;you &s;hall love your enemies, and do good to tho&s;e that hate you. Severe injunction!&mdash;yet you &s;ee by it to how refined a pitch the virtue of a chri&s;tian mu&s;t a&s;pire.</P>
<P>Do not then re&s;t &s;atisfied with being as ju&s;t or kind as the letter of the law exacts&mdash;be actively good, and &s;eek occa&s;ions of exerci&s;ing your kindne&s;s and charity&mdash;to admini&s;ter as far as we are able to the wants of our fellow creatures&mdash;to reclaim the vicious&mdash;to vindicate the character of the injured&mdash;a&s;&s;ert the claims of the friend|le&s;s and oppre&s;&s;ed&mdash;reconcile differences, and be indefatigable in the promotion of peace and happine&s;s to all within the com|pa&s;s of our ability, are employments wor|thy of a rational being.</P>
<P>There are many ca&s;es that occur in life, wherein tho&s;e who will obey only the
<PB N="224" REF="033601_0216_0FF7A31AA38F9B70">rules of legal ju&s;tice, mu&s;t fall &s;hort of tho&s;e notions of hone&s;ty, which natural rea&s;on and con&s;cience &s;ugge&s;t; as a good mind wants not the bonds of human laws, &s;o on &s;ome occa&s;ions it ri&s;es to a genero&s;i|ty that is &s;uperior to their narrow limits. Obey the innate ideas of rectitude which God him&s;elf has &s;tamped on the human &s;oul&mdash;and think it not &s;ufficient to be ju&s;t, except you are generous al&s;o.</P>
<P>Let your conduct be regulated by the nice&s;t rules of propriety and prudence; and let your bo&s;oms glow with the enthu|&s;ia&s;m of virtue, that you may ever &s;hine forth the &s;teady, zealous friend, the bene|volently active neighbour, and the truly u&s;eful member of &s;ociety; con&s;idering your&s;elves as citizens of the world, who&s;e only bu&s;ine&s;s it is to do good.</P>

<P>BUT &s;o exalted and refined a turn of &s;entiment is never the production of ignorance. It is only in cultivated minds we mu&s;t look for it; for the prime fruits of virtue grow not in the &s;oil that has never been broken up by moral in&s;truc|tion. A virtuous and intelligent friend is perhaps the mo&s;t valuable acqui&s;ition a young per&s;on can make; but as one of this de&s;cription may never &s;all to your lot, &s;upply the want thereof, as well as you can, by books.</P>
<P>By all means cultivate a ta&s;te for reading, but take care that your ta&s;te be a ju&s;t one&mdash;that is, be more de&s;irous of in&s;truction than amu&s;ement or you will profit but little by literary pur&s;uits. Tho&s;e who read merely to plea&s;e the
<PB N="226" REF="033601_0218_0FF7A31DC64817E0">imagination, may be &s;ure of not reading to advantage, and do &s;eldom acquire a reli&s;h for works of &s;olid merit and utility. I have never known a young per&s;on who was pa&s;&s;ionately fond of novels capable of reli&s;hing any thing &s;uperior to them. For my own part, I had rather &s;ee a girl wholly ignorant of the alphabet, than at|tached to that &s;pecies of writing; for I am convinced that infinitely more have erred in the conduct of life from that cau&s;e, than from any other. The &s;enti|ments and ideas they impre&s;s, are fatal illu&s;ions to mi&s;lead the poor reader, who, after wa&s;ting days and years in the &s;tudy, is &s;till an utter &s;tranger to the world &s;he lives in&mdash;and, what is wor&s;e, in&s;pired with the mo&s;t erroneous notions of it, which commonly lead to &s;ome fal&s;e &s;tep, or ill-judged connection, that &s;ecures her a wretch for life. It cannot be other|wi&s;e&mdash;for the &s;cenes, characters, and in|cidents, the&s;e books de&s;cribe, are to be found no where but in the author's ro|mantic
<PB N="227" REF="033601_0219_0FF7A32232960AF0">fancy. They have nothing to do with the real knowledge of the world; and con&s;equently, tho&s;e who think to &s;teer through it by &s;uch guides, mu&s;t, in the end, find them&s;elves mi&s;taken. Ju&s;t as well may a traveller think to make the tour of Europe by a chart of A&s;ia.</P>
<P>If curio&s;ity mu&s;t be amu&s;ed, and the imagination plea&s;ed, why may not the under&s;tanding be improved at the &s;ame time? This is very practicable, for there are many works of genius extreme|ly well calculated to an&s;wer each of the&s;e ends; but they are not the hi&s;to|ries of Sir &s;uch a one, Mi&s;s what d'ye call um, or any of tho&s;e futile produc|tions, which the pre&s;s daily emits, to vi|tiate the ta&s;te, and corrupt the princi|ples of the age.</P>
<P>There is a certain mental vigour ne|ce&s;&s;ary to virtue as well as to happine&s;s, but modern novels, under the &s;pecious
<PB N="228" REF="033601_0220_0FF7A323C364A318">ma&s;k of refined &s;entiments, introduce a dangerous &s;oftne&s;s that has often de&s;troy|ed both. True refinement is the glory of a rational creature, but whatever en|ervates the mind, mu&s;t deba&s;e it. Ly|curgus thought &s;o, I &s;uppo&s;e, when he bani&s;hed the poets from his common|wealth; yet &s;urely he lived near enough to Athens to have learned to draw a proper line between ferocity and effemi|nacy.</P>
<P>The pa&s;&s;ion for novelty, &s;o inherent in youth, may be abundantly gratified, by the &s;tudy of hi&s;tory. Here you meet with new and uncommon events&mdash;be|come acquainted with a variety of cha|racters, and are enabled to form a ju&s;t e&s;timate of mankind; for except allow|ing for a few local cu&s;toms or prejudi|ces, human nature was the &s;ame two thou&s;and years ago as at this time. There is &s;omething extremely agreeable to the mind in weighing and examining the
<PB N="229" REF="033601_0221_0FF7A3254F86B370">actions of celebrated per&s;onages, who, in their day, made the mighty tremble&mdash;in marking the ri&s;e or fall of empires, and to be able to determine the &s;ecret cau&s;es of tho&s;e revolutions which once a&s;toni&s;hed the world.</P>
<P>The ages appear as incon&s;iderable points, to tho&s;e who are acquainted with hi&s;tory&mdash;they &s;ee the various nations of the earth pa&s;s in review before them, and trace a more than human power bu&s;y in the affairs of men&mdash;by taking in at one com|prehen&s;ive view &s;o va&s;t a tract of time, they di&s;cern the nice connections of that &s;cheme of Providence, which often appears broken and irregular, when contemplated only through the medium of a few years.</P>
<P>It is almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to be well ver&s;ed in the characters of the politer nations of antiquity, without watching &s;omething of that magnanimity which di&s;tingui&s;hed them; and I know not why an acquaint|ance
<PB N="230" REF="033601_0222_0FF7A326DF89E9E0">with their manners &s;hould not be thought as nece&s;&s;ary in the &s;y&s;tem of FE|MALE EDUCATION, as it u&s;ually is in that of the other &s;ex. If the Greek and Ro|man veterans di&s;played qualities which the heroes of the pre&s;ent day would be proud to imitate, their wives and daugh|ters were often patterns of &s;uch virtue, as would be allowed to dignify a lady of the eighteenth century.</P>
<P>Read modern hi&s;tory as well as antient&mdash;the knowledge of the nations who inha|bit the globe as well as your&s;elves, is amu&s;|ing and intere&s;ting&mdash;the heart, too, may be the better for it&mdash;narrow prejudices are removed, and the better mankind be|come acquainted with each other, the more the divine principle of philanthropy mu&s;t be extended. National enmity has no other parent but ignorance&mdash;the enlight|ened, the philo&s;ophic mind, even through the veil of different tongues and cu&s;toms, can di&s;cern a kindred being&mdash;a mem|ber
<PB N="231" REF="033601_0223_0FF7A32A9262A658">of that univer&s;al family, who&s;e head is the Deity.</P>
<P>Next to travelling it&s;elf, nothing tends more to enlarge the ideas than journals of travels and voyages, if the writers have been faithful and accurate; and you will read them with infinite plea&s;ure, if you have been careful to acquire a knowledge of geography. This renders you familiar with the countries you read of&mdash;You re|collect their &s;oil, climate, and productions &mdash;know their re&s;pective boundaries, and can readily mark out their place on the globe.</P>

<P>AS long as curio&s;ity continues a leading feature in the human character, Biography will form a favourite &s;pecies of reading. Every body is eager to pry into the private character of a celebrated per|&s;onage, and are better plea&s;ed to know, how &s;uch an one acts in dome&s;tic life, than in the &s;enate, or the field. And, indeed, it is there that the be&s;t e&s;timate of the real de&s;cription can be formed.</P>
<P>The private lives of famous per&s;ons afford much edification to the reader; the vice or meanne&s;s too often there di&s;played, teaches us not to be dazzled by the blaze of popularity or power; and to contemn that virtue which is built on the de&s;ire of fame alone. If on the other hand, by following the&s;e darlings of fame to the clo|&s;et,
<PB N="233" REF="033601_0225_0FF7A32EA2312C80">or the fire-&s;ide, we di&s;cover the &s;ame noblene&s;s of heart that di&s;tingui&s;hes them with the multitude, ju&s;tly they become patterns for our example; the mind re|joices to find &s;omething about them that is <HI>imitable,</HI> for though few are called forth as di&s;tingui&s;hed actors on the theatre of the world, all may, if they plea&s;e, be <HI>great</HI> in private life: That is, may acquire tho&s;e amiable qualities of mind, which can on|ly con&s;titute real greatne&s;s; without which the hero is no more than a hypocrite, and even the robe of royalty, but a tin&s;el or|nament to cover real meanne&s;s.</P>
<P>Your chief aim &s;hould be the know|ledge of the human heart, and that is in general more fully di&s;covered in trifling traits and circum&s;tances, than by impor|tant actions performed under the public eye. But you no where find human na|ture &s;o impartially delineated, as in the &s;acred writings. There the hi&s;torians, neither influenced by pa&s;&s;ion nor preju|dice,
<PB N="234" REF="033601_0226_0FF7A33140ECB5A8">relate both actions and their &s;e|cret &s;prings with unerring candour; never calumniating enemies, or &s;tooping to flat|ter the favourites of their nation.</P>
<P>The Jewi&s;h writers had the faire&s;t op|portunities imaginable for exaggerating the virtues of their heroes, con&s;idering the miraculous powers &s;o often exerted in their behalf. Such an adventure as that of David with Goliah, would have been thought by a Pagan writer, &s;ufficient grounds for exalting his favorite to a God: yet the in&s;pired Biographer has drawn that Prince with all his frailties about him; all the inequality of humanity; &s;ometimes glowing with the rapturous devotion of a Seraphim;&mdash;at others, en&s;laved by the meane&s;t pa&s;&s;ions. Such in&s;tances of can|dour, con&s;idered with the national pride of the Jews, leave no room to doubt the veracity of the &s;acred penman on any oc|ca&s;ion.</P>

The &s;criptures al&s;o finely illu&s;trate many parts of profane hi&s;tory: we are told of embattled armies, and cities level|led with the du&s;t; but it is only in holy writ we find tho&s;e armies prophetically mar&s;halled, and that de&s;truction denoun|ced perhaps an hundred years before the event. The&s;e are in&s;tances which im|pre&s;s the mind with reverence for the &s;a|cred records, and fill it with augu&s;t ideas of the eternal Providence.</P>
<P>The works of our be&s;t morali&s;ts will not be unentertaining to you, if your ta&s;te for reading be as good as I wi&s;h it. A|mong&s;t the productions of this kind, are the Spectator and the Rambler; as con&s;pi|cuous for the elegance of their language, as the &s;oundne&s;s of their morality. But there are no better rules for the moral con|duct of life, than are found in the writings of Solomon, and the Son of Sirach; which, though compo&s;ed &s;o many ages ago, may yet be read to much advantage, by tho&s;e

<P>If you are fond of poetry, be careful to read only what is good of it. There is a kind of ver&s;ification that tends to deba&s;e the mind;&mdash;wherever immortality or in|delicacy is found, &s;uch mu&s;t ever be the effect. Elegance of numbers though a re|qui&s;ite, is yet the lowe&s;t recommendation of good poetry;&mdash;its characteri&s;tics are dignity of thought, purity of expre&s;&s;ion, and, above all, the be&s;t principles of piety and morality. For this rea&s;on, tho&s;e poe|tical pieces extant in the Bible, are by good judges, allowed to be truly &s;ublime. Poet|ry in its original &s;tate, being only the har|monious effu&s;ions of a mind glowing with elevated &s;entiments of genero&s;ity, gratitude and devotion.

Natural hi&s;tory affords a delightful &s;tu|dy&mdash;it is not however expected that you &s;hould have a &s;y&s;tematic idea of every ve|getable, animal, or in&s;ect; but it is un|pardonable, for one who is ble&s;t with lei|&s;ure and opportunity, not to have at lea&s;t a general knowledge of the mo&s;t con&s;picu|ous of Nature's works:&mdash;to be ignorant of the beauty and properties of tho&s;e, is to wander over the fair creation, as Thom&s;on expre&s;&s;es it, "with brute uncon&s;cious gaze." The curious and intelligent &s;pec|tator finds the variegated face of nature, a &s;ource of rational amu&s;ement, and reads in glowing characters the wi&s;dom of the Deity.

<P>AMONGST the accompli&s;hments nece&s;&s;ary to the female character, I think needle work may claim the fir&s;t place, it having &s;o clo&s;e a connection with neatne&s;s which is indi&s;putably requi&s;ite to render you comfortable to your&s;elves, or amiable in the e&s;teem of others. The ladies of the la&s;t century certainly held needle-work in much greater e&s;timation than tho&s;e of the pre&s;ent; witne&s;s the many laborious performances that yet remain as proofs of their amazing indu&s;try in this re&s;pect&mdash;but the world is ever prone to extremes, and becau&s;e this art was then pur&s;ued to the exclu&s;ion of every intellectual accom|pli&s;hment, there are many in our days who &s;eem to think it beneath their &s;tudy or ambition.</P>
<P>The Mahometan &s;entiment which pre|vailed &s;ome years ago, of the inferiority of the female mind, &s;eems exploded in this
<PB N="241" REF="033601_0233_0FF7A341790A8A00">age of univer&s;al refinement: and a wo|man of cultivated under&s;tanding is no longer a phenomenon. The paths of knowledge are rendered acce&s;&s;ible&mdash;men of learning have &s;tooped from the eleva|tions of &s;cience to accelerate the improve|ments of the other &s;ex&mdash;they abridge, com|pile, explain for their a&s;&s;i&s;tance and ad|vancement in polite literature.</P>
<P>Make all the u&s;e you po&s;&s;ibly can of &s;uch advantages, and be convinced that the cultivation of the mind will exalt you in the e&s;timation of rational beings&mdash;will open to you exhau&s;tle&s;s &s;ources of amu&s;e|ment and delight, of which the ignorant can have no conception. Yet be careful, my dear girls, never to overlook one femi|nine grace or accompli&s;hment. There is a line of character drawn between the &s;ex|es, which neither can pa&s;s without becom|ing contemptible. It is not to make you de&s;pi&s;e tho&s;e acquirements which have ever been appropriated to the female &s;ex, that
<PB N="242" REF="033601_0234_0FF7A34319072E48">you are incited to mental attainments, but to render you &s;till more valuable as wo|men; and the better your minds are cul|tivated, the more you will &s;ee the proprie|ty of attending to tho&s;e minutiae which be|come the condition in which Providence has placed you.</P>
<P>I do not &s;ee how you can acquit your|&s;elves tolerably in dome&s;tic life, without a knowledge of needle-work; but granting your rank and fortune may place you above the ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of learning that part of it which is called plain work&mdash;yet con|&s;ider how far the ornamental kinds may be of u&s;e to amu&s;e the intervals of plea&s;ures, or other pur&s;uits, as well as to promote the di&s;play of an elegant ta&s;te. Even our in|nocent amu&s;ements require variation, and the mind may be agreeably relieved, by imitating with the needle the beautiful productions of nature&mdash;but there is &s;ome|thing which places a &s;kill in needle work in a much more important point of view,
<PB N="243" REF="033601_0235_0FF7A347A7EE6598">and that is, the incon&s;tancy of fortune, which in her capricious moods has been often known to compel tho&s;e, whom once &s;he &s;miled on, to procure their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence by tho&s;e very arts which were acquired only for amu&s;ement.&mdash;Whatever may be a re&s;ource again&s;t that mutability which marks all human affairs, becomes an object of importance.</P>
<P>A proficiency in the arts of dome&s;tic management and oeconomy, ought ju&s;tly to be ranked among the accompli&s;hments of a young lady. You mu&s;t be unacquainted with nothing that appertains to good hou&s;e|wifery. Some girls have I known profe&s;s &s;o violent an attachment to literary pur|&s;uits, that they are content to remain igno|rant of common attainments. This &s;hews a pitiable weakne&s;s&mdash;elevated minds are attentive to every thing; and, believe me, it is very po&s;&s;ible to po&s;&s;e&s;s a competent knowledge of polite literature, and be well ver&s;ed in the methods of well governing a
<PB N="244" REF="033601_0236_0FF7A34934A48C18">hou&s;e at the &s;ame time&mdash;the latter quali|fications have of them&s;elves con&s;tituted many an u&s;eful character in female life, which is more than can be &s;aid of the for|mer. Blend, therefore, my beloved girls, <HI>polite</HI> with <HI>u&s;eful</HI> acquirements, and you will be what I wi&s;h you.</P>
<P>In writing, acquire, if po&s;&s;ible, a good hand, yet that is not &s;o e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary as the being able to write grammatically&mdash;the violation of the <HI>common</HI> rules of gram|mar, is an indi&s;putable mark of low breed|ing; and although my Lord Che&s;terfield &s;arca&s;tically &s;aid that bad &s;pelling was only allowable in a woman, it certainly is not allowable in any one, who pretends to an education above the vulgar. Could you write as fine a hand as even A&mdash;n him|&s;elf, bad &s;pelling would di&s;grace the whole. The &s;ub&s;tituting <HI>have</HI> for <HI>has, are</HI> for <HI>is,</HI> &amp;c. infallibly &s;inks you in the e&s;timation of well bred per&s;ons. In order to avoid errors of this kind, habit is to be particu|larly
<PB N="245" REF="033601_0237_0FF7A34ACAFAC698">guarded again&s;t. If in your early years you are not careful to write and &s;pell correctly, it is a thou&s;and to one if you ever do. You &s;ee, therefore, of what con|&s;equence it is that you pay a pre&s;ent atten|tion to the&s;e points.</P>
<P>I reckon among the u&s;eful attainments, the ability of penning an epi&s;tle with pro|priety and elegance&mdash;many fortunate cir|cum&s;tances in life may be facilitated there|by&mdash;a well written letter has often effect|ed what verbal reque&s;ts have &s;ought in vain&mdash;be&s;ides this con&s;ideration, how great|ly mu&s;t the &s;weet intercour&s;e of friend&s;hip be improved by a free and intelligent cor|re&s;pondence! Two friends, though placed at the extremities of the globe, may thus enjoy all the plea&s;ures of &s;uch a connec|tion; but except you attain the de&s;irable habit of expre&s;&s;ing your &s;entiments with|out embarra&s;&s;ment, hope not to enjoy any thing of &s;o delicate a &s;atisfaction. Letters &s;hould be the pictures of the &s;oul; and &s;o

Write as you would &s;peak, were the per&s;ons you addre&s;s imme|diately before you. There is no more than this nece&s;&s;ary to e&s;tabli&s;h that ea&s;ine&s;s of &s;tyle which is the chief beauty of epi&s;|tolary corre&s;pondence. That good breed|ing which I hope will be habitual to you, will dictate tho&s;e terms and forms of ad|dre&s;s, the condition of tho&s;e to whom you write requires.&mdash;We do not always find the mo&s;t learned people write the mo&s;t agreeable letters&mdash;perhaps for no other rea&s;on than that they take too much trou|ble about it, and, like the good Archbi&s;hop of Benevento, reject the fir&s;t thought that occurs. Some that I have known indite an epi&s;tle in &s;uch a &s;tiff and formal &s;tyle, and load it &s;o di&s;gu&s;tfully with tautology, that one would almo&s;t take it for an Act of Par|liament. When you write a letter, my dear girls, forget the idea of pen, ink and paper&mdash;&s;uppo&s;e only you are &s;peaking to
<PB N="247" REF="033601_0239_0FF7A3510B376620">the per&s;on, and you will write an <HI>agreea|ble,</HI> if not a <HI>fine</HI> letter&mdash;to effect the latter, &s;omething mu&s;t have been effected by dame Nature&mdash;however, this I know&mdash; that the mo&s;t elevated &s;entiments would not look graceful in &s;uch compo&s;itions, ex|cept accompanied by perfect ea&s;e and ex|pre&s;&s;ion, and have the appearance of flow|ing &s;pontaneou&s;ly from the heart. Many excellent models of epi&s;tolary writing have been recommended to young proficients. You cannot have better than tho&s;e a&s;cribed to Pope Ganganelli;&mdash;whoever was the author, he has certainly hit on that ea&s;e, &s;prightline&s;s and elegance, which it is my earne&s;t wi&s;h may characteri&s;e whatever falls from your pen.

<P>WHEN you compare the ankward motions of a ru&s;tic, with the genteel and graceful movement of a per&s;on of education, you cannot but be a&s;&s;ured of the utility of dancing, but it &s;hould ne|ver be forgotten, that to give this &s;upe|riority of mein and air is the chief end of that polite accompli&s;hment;&mdash;to lo&s;e &s;ight of this idea, is to take away the real worth of that branch of genteel ed|ucation:&mdash;to reduce it to an unimpor|tant, if not pernicious attainment. How|ever a knowledge of dancing may &s;ome|times conduce to &s;ocial plea&s;ure, and in that light be e&s;teemed an agreeable and innocent recreation, I cannot help think|ing, that the &s;ame application that is re|qui&s;ite to form an opera dancer, may very well be di&s;pen&s;ed with in a young lady of a different character. The ex|travagant leaps and ge&s;tures of &s;ome fa|&s;hionable
<PB N="249" REF="033601_0241_0FF7A354282A7C68">females, make me think of the &s;peech of Philip of Macedon to his &s;on, on another occa&s;ion&mdash;I am ready to a&s;k if they "are not a&s;hamed to <HI>dance</HI> &s;o well."</P>
<P>There is &s;carcely a human &s;oul, how|ever apparently dead to &s;en&s;ibility, but is in &s;ome mea&s;ure alive to the extatic charms of mu&s;ic. The &s;tory of Orphe|us is more than a fable&mdash;minds almo&s;t as inert and inanimate as trees them&s;elves, have been moved by the power of har|monious &s;ounds:&mdash;why el&s;e does the gap|ing ru&s;tic, follow with &s;uch manife&s;t de|light, the itinerant mu&s;ician; and why but that the effect of mu&s;ic on the pa&s;|&s;ions is &s;o inconte&s;tibly proved, has the army adopted the &s;ons of Apollo with tho&s;e of Mars? Since then this &s;cience has &s;o great an influence on the feelings of the &s;oul, is it not &s;urprizing that the polite world &s;hould not be more ambi|tions of enjoying tho&s;e &s;ublime &s;en&s;ations,
<PB N="250" REF="033601_0242_0FF7A356D4CDAB18">which the be&s;t pieces are &s;o abundantly capable of exciting, and not re&s;t poorly &s;atisfied with the luke warm plea&s;ures of &s;ing-&s;ong, while the noble compo&s;itions of great ma&s;ters, lie bye totally di&s;re|garded. Indulge, my dear girls, a turn for mu&s;ic, if nature has given you &s;uch; but do not permit a &s;ong tune, or an opera air to be the limits of your excel|lence in that enchanting &s;cience.</P>
<P>Drawing, painting, &amp;c. ju&s;tly form a part of polite education, becau&s;e they fur|ni&s;h an agreeable, as well as rational amu&s;e|ment. They lead to a familiarity with the beauties of nature, and that can &s;carce|ly fail to advance the mind a degree high|er, even to the contemplation of her Di|vine Author. But if it had not this hap|py tendency, drawing is &s;till a laudable a|mu&s;ement, becau&s;e an innocent one; and whatever furni&s;hes a recreation of that character, may certainly be deemed an auxiliary to virtue.</P>

An acquaintance with the languages of polite nations, greatly enlarges the mind. It is the property of ignorance to e&s;teem nothing valuable that a foreign country produces; and &s;carcely to allow that its inhabitants are human. Nothing tends more immediately to remove &s;uch illibe|ral prejudices, than &s;tudying the language of the people thus de&s;pi&s;ed. The &s;uper|cilious contemner is &s;urpri&s;ed to find them rational, and expre&s;&s;ing &s;imilar ideas with tho&s;e of his own country.</P>
<P>If nece&s;&s;ity or inclination ever leads you from your native land, a previous ac|quaintance with the language of tho&s;e you re&s;ide among, would much facilitate your plea&s;ure and convenience; would open to you the avenues of &s;ocial love and friend&s;hip, and take off much from tho&s;e comfortle&s;s &s;en&s;ations the mind is apt to feel in the idea of being among&s;t a people it knows not.

<P>Arithmetic is a dry &s;tudy, yet certain|ly a very u&s;eful one, to tho&s;e who would manage their affairs with oeconomy and prudence;&mdash;a thorough knowledge of the

<P>From a total ignorance of letters in female life, we are advanced to an age which requires every girl to be made a grammarian; yet it unfortunately hap|pens, that of the numbers who profe&s;s to have &s;tudied the grammar of their na|tive tongue, few &s;peak or write it with that accuracy which could be wi&s;hed; indeed the progre&s;s that women u&s;ually make in that &s;cience, is &s;eldom of it&s;elf &s;ufficient to give an habitual elegance of expre&s;&s;ion; they are more indebted for it to frequent reading of the be&s;t authors, and the conver&s;ation of tho&s;e who have them&s;elves acquired it perfect;&mdash;what you can, acquire of grammar by &s;uch a&s;&s;i&s;tances of the&s;e.

Geography is a &s;tudy that will plea&s;e you an hundred times better&mdash;this is not like the former, a &s;et of dry rules, but almo&s;t every advance you make therein, will abundantly repay your pains by the novelty of the information it produces. Be&s;ides, I cannot imagine how the fre|quent relations that occur in common di&s;cour&s;e will be intelligible, without &s;ome acquaintance with this &s;tudy. I am &s;ure if you are no geographer, even a new&s;paper will be as inexplicable as an Egyptian hieroglyphic.

Courage be|longs not to the warrior alone&mdash;it is as of|ten found in the clo&s;et, as the field.</P>
<P>That re&s;olution which is nece&s;&s;ary for every valuable purpo&s;e of life, is the fruit only of active minds, and was never found with indolence and &s;loth;&mdash;determine therefore to conquer every tendency to an inactive temper.

<P>Many a bright and &s;hining talent lies hid in a napkin, for want of activity to unfold it; nor do we unfrequently meet with per&s;ons &s;truggling with di&s;tre&s;&s;es, which require only their own exertions to remove. Indolence takes hold of the di&s;po&s;ition much oftener than is acknow|ledged; it is po&s;&s;ible to be wholly under its dominion, and yet &s;u&s;pect nothing of it; and, what is yet more &s;trange, to be|lieve
<PB N="258" REF="033601_0250_0FF7A369A0CDFEB8">one's &s;elf to be the mo&s;t diligent per&s;on in the world at the very time.

Without the quality I have recommended it could never have been attained, for though much be owing to accidental ad|vantages, &s;uch as the being born in an en|lightened country afford, yet no incon&s;i|derable portion of diligence is required to render the&s;e advantages per&s;onally effec|tual. It is this, my dear girls, that makes them yours, and without it, the &s;oul will

<P>It may &s;eem &s;trange to tell you of old age, before you have &s;carcely pa&s;&s;ed your infancy; yet I mu&s;t not conceal from you, that a period will arrive, when exterior at|tractions will be no more:&mdash;when mental acquirements will prove your highe&s;t lu&s;tre and &s;ublime&s;t comfort. However de&s;pi|cable an ignorant woman appears at any part of her life, in the decline of it &s;he is &s;ure to become far more contemptible; at that time it is the improvements &s;he has made in early days, that give dignity of character. An old age of cards nece&s;&s;ari|ly &s;ucceeds a youth of folly. Pope could not have &s;aid any thing more de&s;tructive of the in&s;ignificancy of tho&s;e ancient ha|bits, than he has expre&s;&s;ed in that conci&s;e &s;atire. If you would avoid the contempt which never fails to attend a frivolous old age, you mu&s;t pa&s;s a youth of diligence and application.</P>

But then the plea&s;ures re&s;ulting from it &s;urpa&s;s de&s;cription, the &s;atisfactions of a rich cultivated mind are only fully known to the happy po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or; one of them, we are a&s;&s;ured, is a noble independence, which creates, if I may &s;o &s;peak, its own happi|ne&s;s; is not indebted to di&s;&s;ipation, or the caprice of others; but can derive from it&s;elf, exhau&s;tle&s;s re&s;ources for &s;olitude or &s;ociety.

<P>CULTIVATED minds have plea|&s;ures which &s;urpa&s;s the vulgar apprehen|&s;ion. They have their pains as well&mdash; for there is an evil peculiar to refined feeling, of which the untaught ru&s;tic is happily ignorant. This happens when refinement, or at lea&s;t the affectation of it, is carried to &s;uch an extreme, that it degenerates into fal&s;e delicacy. The &s;ymptoms of the malady are a kind of &s;ecret di&s;&s;atisfaction with every thing&mdash; the common ble&s;&s;ings of life are de&s;pi&s;ed, as inadequate to the refinement of their ideas, and every petty &s;light angmented by &s;uch a quickne&s;s of perception, as leads them to &s;ee affronts, when none perhaps have been intended. And this peevi&s;h|ly irritable temper they are plea&s;ed to dignify with the name of &s;en&s;ibility, and pique them&s;elves on a di&s;po&s;ition that di&s;qualifies them for &s;ocial virtue or &s;ocial
<PB N="263" REF="033601_0255_0FF7A3768FCBE260">happine&s;s. What pity, that a quality meant to highten every real ble&s;&s;ing, &s;hould be a&s;cribed to the mere chimera of a &s;ickly brain! Never may you, my dears, by indulging the&s;e fictitious feelings, re|fine away the felicity, which a kind Pro|vidence &s;catters in your path of life. Nou|ri&s;h in your bo&s;oms humility and good na|ture&mdash;the&s;e will teach you to make the be&s;t of your lot, whatever it be, and give a reli&s;h to every enjoyment&mdash;all is &s;erene where they re&s;ide. Humility, by arro|gating nothing to her&s;elf, remains un|hurt at the &s;upercilious &s;corn of igno|rance or pride; and good-nature, by ca&s;ting a veil over the foibles of others, pre&s;ents to our view the be&s;t &s;ide of this motley &s;cene.</P>
<P>Without doubt, &s;uperior minds have a quicker &s;en&s;e of what is beautiful in nature, or de&s;irable in life, than a pea|&s;ant, who&s;e ideas extend not beyond his daily occupations&mdash;perhaps they feel al|&s;o
<PB N="264" REF="033601_0256_0FF7A3781D192860">more acutely the evils of their condi|tion; yet the per&s;ons who &s;uffer mo&s;t by this affected &s;en&s;icility are not they who have the greate&s;t &s;hare of afflictive events, but the idly &s;peculative, who being em|ployed to no good purpo&s;e, have time to nouri&s;h tho&s;e artificial feelings which Nature knows nothing of.</P>
<P>Sen&s;ibility!&mdash;What is it?&mdash;Is it not that delicate perception of natural and moral beauty, which the Creator has implanted in the &s;oul to exalt its happi|ne&s;s, and awaken its noble&s;t pa&s;&s;ions? How greatly, then, do they err who &s;ub|&s;titute in the room of this be&s;t gift of Heaven, that which is the very weakne&s;s of humanity, pride and peevi&s;hne&s;s?</P>
<P>It is paying a very poor compliment to literary pur&s;uits, to &s;uppo&s;e they are productive of that &s;oftne&s;s which unfits the mind for enduring the common ac|cidents of life. And tho&s;e attainments
<PB N="265" REF="033601_0257_0FF7A379AC6B27A0">are of little value that &s;erve no better purpo&s;e than to barb the arrows of mis|fortune with &s;tings which the enlighten|ed never feel. But probably they who dream of &s;uch effects are the &s;uperficial, who never dived beyond the &s;urface of literature, and who&s;e feeble intellects are unable to dige&s;t even the little they have imbibed.</P>
<P>If you have really made any advance|ment in mental improvement, it will in|vigorate the powers of the &s;oul, and in|&s;pire her with that magnanimity which is certainly nece&s;&s;ary to the happine&s;s of a being, who is every moment expo&s;|ed to &s;orrow and di&s;appointment. Va|lue not your&s;elves on any refinements that are &s;hort of this effect.</P>
<P>Some, I know, are even re&s;trained from the exerci&s;e of benevolence by this affectation of &s;en&s;ibility; their feelings are too tender to bear with &s;cenes of di&s;|tre&s;s,
<PB N="266" REF="033601_0258_0FF7A37C381EAB30">and too refined for the duties of &s;ocial life; they therefore keep at an unfriendly di&s;tance from &s;ociety, le&s;t the ignorance or rudene&s;s they there may meet with, &s;hould wound their ex|ce&s;&s;ive delicacy; but how is this obey|ing the injunction of the Apo&s;tle, who exhorts us to be kindly affectioned one to another, bearing with each others in|firmities?</P>
<P>In fine, my dear girls, come to the fea&s;t of &s;ocial life, accompanied by the virtues of humility and charity, and you will not ari&s;e di&s;&s;atisfied from the enter|tainment.</P>

<P>I HAVE often thought that the great prevalence of vice ari&s;es chiefly from a culpable weakne&s;s of temper&mdash;for there is nothing &s;o amiable in it that it &s;hould be followed for its own &s;ake.

<PB N="268" REF="033601_0260_0FF7A3813AC39440">a proper firmne&s;s, without which neither virtue, happine&s;s, or dignity of character can be long maintained.

<Q>Too weak to think, too indolent to chu&s;e.</Q>
<P>In bu&s;ine&s;s, and the affairs of life, a proper firmne&s;s is indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary. Tho&s;e who can be influenced by every ad|vi&s;er, or intimidated at every appearance of difficulty, mu&s;t of cour&s;e be de&s;ultory

Ob&s;tacles will attend the be&s;t concerted &s;chemes, and mankind will ever think differently about them; but the truly wi&s;e will await with &s;teady patience the i&s;&s;ue of tho&s;e mea&s;ures they have been careful to found in pru|dence and the moral fitne&s;s of things. Some will undertake nothing, till they &s;ee the path &s;mooth before them, and attain almo&s;t a certainty of &s;ucce&s;s. Such will find their lives wa&s;ted, before they have determined on the plan of it. Tho&s;e who be&s;t know the &s;tate of humanity, will be convinced, that to de&s;ign prudently and act firmly, is all that can be done by mortals.</P>
<P>Without re&s;olution, it will &s;ometimes be impo&s;&s;ible to act agreeably to the dic|tates of right rea&s;on, and virtue, for the&s;e are not always the <HI>ton;</HI> and when that is the ca&s;e, no incon&s;iderable &s;hare of forti|tude
<PB N="270" REF="033601_0262_0FF7A3854FECACE8">is requi&s;ite to repel the attacks of ri|dicule or amu&s;ement&mdash;nor can the trea|&s;ures of knowledge be explored, without a portion of it&mdash;for, "there is nothing truly valuable to be attained without pains and labour."

Parna&s;&s;us it&s;elf was a craggy rock, but then the mu&s;es dwelt on its top.</P>
<P>But if re&s;olution be nece&s;&s;ary to the attaining whatever is valuable or de&s;irable in life, it is no le&s;s &s;o to the &s;upporting us under a deprivation of it. The race is not to the &s;wift, nor the battle to the &s;trong&mdash;hence it follows, that the wi&s;e&s;t mea&s;ures do not always meet with &s;ucee&s;s, nor can virtue it&s;elf prevent the encroach|ments of affliction&mdash;in &s;uch circum&s;tances fortitude gives a dignity to &s;uffering, and
<PB N="271" REF="033601_0263_0FF7A387CD01AA88">tends al&s;o to alleviate the weight of it. Every one knows the &s;entiment of the phi|lo&s;opher&mdash; <Q>that a good man &s;truggling with adver&s;ity, is a &s;ight on which the gods them&s;elves might look down with delight.</Q> However that be, it is certain that &s;uch a character never fails to com|mand the re&s;pect and veneration of man|kind. Magnanimity, of all the qualities of the mind, &s;eems mo&s;t &s;ecure of admi|ration. The Saviour of the world incul|cated it, when having forwarned his di&s;ci|ples of their approaching &s;ufferings, he enjoined them to po&s;&s;e&s;s their &s;ouls in pa|tience. Patience is among&s;t the Chri&s;tian duties, what magnanimity is in the li&s;t of heroic virtues. They are &s;ynonimous terms&mdash;both imply that calm, un&s;haken fortitude, which is at once characteri&s;tic of the hero and the Chri&s;tian.</P>
<P>But do not conclude this firmne&s;s of mind&mdash;this laudable re&s;olution is calcula|ted only to be admired. It is of the high|e&s;t
<PB N="272" REF="033601_0264_0FF7A38A5002DC98">actual &s;ervice to the unfortunate, not only by enabling them to &s;u&s;tain the bur|den of their &s;ufferings, but by opening a way to better pro&s;pects. The timid and irre&s;olute &s;ink at the approach of adver&s;ity, into a de&s;pondency the mo&s;t unfriendly to their affairs, by precluding that courage|ous indu&s;try which might render them more tolerable; and therefore, by the na|ture of things, augment the very evils of which they complain.</P>
<P>Cultivate in all circum&s;tances this in|nate con&s;tancy&mdash;it will aid you in the at|tainment of every good and valuable end. In pro&s;perity, will &s;ecure you from the corruptions of vanity&mdash;impart dignity and &s;erenity to adver&s;ity.

<P>MY epi&s;tles to you, my dear girls, are written without the lea&s;t attention to method; their re&s;pective &s;ubjects have more the appearance of chance, than de|&s;ign; and therefore, may be ju&s;tly cal|led cur&s;ory thoughts on various &s;ubjects. Young folks, I know, do not love preci&s;e rules, and perhaps you deem the irregu|larity of my letters their chief merit. Al|low them, however, one more&mdash;that of &s;incerity, and believe that the &s;entiments they contain, flow from the heart; I be|lieve, I need not add the word <HI>&s;ponta|neou&s;ly.</HI></P>
<P>As I di&s;claim all methodical arrange|ment of my &s;ubjects, I will here give you my thoughts, on that very important part of female &s;tudy, dre&s;s. Be not afraid that I am about to confine you to a primitive plainne&s;s, though probably, &s;uch a mode
<PB N="274" REF="033601_0266_0FF7A38E62780D08">may be found more advantageous to beau|ty and elegance, than modern finery; yet I &s;hall recommend that which is at once agreeable to fa&s;hion, and your own rank and circum&s;tances. To reconcile the&s;e three conditions, is no ea&s;y ta&s;k, yet herein lies a chief perfection of the female character; few women po&s;&s;e&s;s the happy art;&mdash;yet tho&s;e who do, mu&s;t be allowed a very &s;uperior degree of merit. It is no incon&s;iderable trait in the character of an amiable young lady, that &s;he knows how to &s;upport a genteel appearance; and yet pay a ju&s;t regard to the frugality, which probably her limited circum&s;tances re|quire.</P>
<P>A fanta&s;tical and expen&s;ive turn in dre&s;s, is the certain mark of a little mind; but that attention to it, which principally regards neatne&s;s, is extremely laudable. Re&s;olve to be always neat, or you can ne|ver be well-dre&s;&s;ed:&mdash;a dirty ruffle, a torn apron, &amp;c. are &s;ufficient to di&s;grace
<PB N="275" REF="033601_0267_0FF7A390E6A595D0">the mo&s;t &s;plendid apparel. Neatne&s;s is al|ways in your power, and will always ren|der you re&s;pectable in whatever rank of life you are placed; but finery without it is nothing more than a ridiculous glare, which is never &s;een but with di&s;gu&s;t.</P>
<P>Fa&s;hion has impo&s;ed &s;ome general rules, which may innocently be followed under the re&s;trictions I have mentioned. Your clothes may be made according to the mode, though the materials which compo&s;e thern, be le&s;s co&s;tly than if they belonged to a dutche&s;s. An uncouth, ill-fa&s;hioned habit, derogates even from the importance of a philo&s;opher; and it is not till after a near acquaintance, that merit is di&s;covered through a &s;habby garment&mdash;&s;o much are mankind governed by appear|ance.</P>
<P>"Prithee good Xenocrates (&s;aid Plato to his pupil) &s;acrifice to the graces." That great man knew how much the mental ac|compli&s;hments
<PB N="276" REF="033601_0268_0FF7A3936AD72DA8">compli&s;hments might be illu&s;trated and adorned by a poli&s;hed exterior;&mdash;a wi&s;e per&s;on, it is true, would not make this al|together the criterion of merit, yet per|haps, would not readily look for worth be|neath an ungraceful exterior.</P>
<P>After all, my dear girls, e&s;teem the frivolous, though often trouble&s;ome arts of dre&s;s, but as a tax you are in &s;ome &s;ort obliged to pay to the folly of the age. Remember on all occa&s;ions, that external ornaments cannot make you better or hap|pier women. Great minds, however they may have judged it nece&s;&s;ary to conform to in&s;ignificant cu&s;toms, have always re|garded them in their proper light. The attention &s;uch are &s;een to &s;hew to the idol fa&s;hion, is only a good natured conde&s;cen|&s;ion to the weakne&s;s of mankind, in points they judge of an indifferent nature, and much too trifling to become the objects of their &s;erious cares.

<P>A great deal has been written on the &s;ubject, and every one who has the care of youth, fails not to inculcate the keep|ing good company;&mdash;the only misfor|tune is, that the term has &s;eldom been &s;ufficiently explained, and the young mind is left to annex to it the ideas of birth and fortune, till by degrees the ex|pre&s;&s;ion is &s;uppo&s;ed to imply both the&s;e qualifications.</P>

But here let merit alone, and not adven|titious circum&s;tances, influence your &s;elec|tion&mdash;de&s;pi&s;e that contemptible weakne&s;s which piques it&s;elf on the rank, rather than the mental value of an acquaintance; and never let a principle of vanity lead you to the &s;ervile imitation of vice or folly, how|ever &s;anctioned by wealth or titles.

<P>THERE are certain re&s;trictions ne|ce&s;&s;ary to render the gift of &s;peech what the great Creator de&s;igned it&mdash;a princi|pal means of happine&s;s to his rationl crea|tures. The fir&s;t of the&s;e is an habitual care never to violate the laws of truth. The plea&s;ures re&s;ulting from mutual con|ver&s;ation vani&s;h entirely, when no de|pendence can be placed in the &s;peaker's veracity. Tho&s;e who &s;peak merely from the &s;ugge&s;tions of imagination, or, what is wor&s;e, malignity, are ju&s;tly charge|able with half the &s;trife that di&s;turbs the peace of &s;ociety. Such per&s;ons are the mo&s;t dangerous companions, and need only to be known to be generally di&s;pi&s;|ed and avoided. Indeed, &s;o high a re|gard veracity obtains among people of refinement, that you cannot offer a more gro&s;s affront than to accu&s;e them of the violation of it.</P>
<P><PB N="284" REF="033601_0276_0FF7A3A5B711FDF0">
Of all that has been &s;aid in admira|tion of Cato's character, nothing reflects &s;o great a lu&s;tre on it, as that &s;triking, though tacit eulogium, be&s;towed on him in one of the Roman Courts of Judica|ture, where a cau&s;e being to be tried which required two witne&s;&s;es, and one only appearing, the Judge declared he could not di&s;pen&s;e with the law, even <HI>though Cato him&s;elf were the witne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>Be&s;ides, as Archbi&s;hop Tillot&s;on fine|ly ob&s;erves, a con&s;tant adherence to truth has the lea&s;t trouble and difficulty in it, it &s;its always upon the lips; where|as a lye is trouble&s;ome, and needs a great many more to make it good.</P>
<P>Next to the character of a liar, that of the detracter is the mo&s;t odious&mdash;a habit of traducing the reputation of others, by &s;peaking all the ill we have heard of them, or putting the wor&s;t con|&s;tructions on their actions, is totally op|po&s;ite
<PB N="285" REF="033601_0277_0FF7A3A746C2FCD0">to the &s;pirit of Chri&s;tianity, which breathes nothing but candour and cha|rity. There is al&s;o &s;omething extreme|ly mean in the practice, as the accu&s;ed per&s;ons have &s;eldom an opportunity of refuting the charge. The cruel a&s;per|&s;ion is borne on the wings of &s;candal from circle to circle, nor perhaps reach|es the injured party till the wound given to reputation is too deep for cure.</P>
<P>Barbarous as &s;uch a cu&s;tom is, I need not &s;ay how greatly it prevails in almo&s;t all companies. I have, however, the charity to believe it does not always pro|ceed from malice or envy. When no knowledge has been trea&s;ured up in the mind&mdash;no u&s;eful information acquired, conver&s;ation cannot receive aid from in|tellectual &s;tores&mdash;what then, mu&s;t be|come of it?&mdash;mu&s;t it flag and &s;ilence&mdash;dreadful &s;ilence reign?&mdash;No, &s;omething mu&s;t re-kindle it; and when no ration|al &s;ubject ari&s;es, that &s;omething mu&s;t be
<PB N="286" REF="033601_0278_0FF7A3A8D80830F0">&s;candal. This, though it may be a pal|liation of the crime, is yet no excu&s;e; for the wounds given by unmeaning ig|norance are as deep as tho&s;e inflicted by premeditated rancour. How &s;hameful is it that an impertinent eagerne&s;s for talking &s;hould thus wantonly explore the &s;ecret rece&s;&s;es of dome&s;tic life, and pre&s;ume to judge of actions, the motives of which cannot be &s;canned by the&s;e ig|norant prattlers!</P>
<P>The mo&s;t effectual way to &s;ecure your&s;elves from the commi&s;&s;ion of this vice, will be the adorning your minds with &s;uch acqui&s;itions of knowledge, and u&s;eful intelligence, as will enable you to furni&s;h &s;ubjects for conver&s;ation, with|out de&s;cending to frivolity or detraction. But &s;hould you not be &s;o happy as to po&s;|&s;e&s;s the&s;e de&s;irable re&s;ources, I hope you will have &s;o much candour and good-nature as to be content with being ac|counted a dull and lifele&s;s companion, rather than indulge an eagerne&s;s for talk|ing
<PB N="287" REF="033601_0279_0FF7A3AD670E5638">at the expence of other people's good name.</P>
<P>Detraction is not only a violation of the rules of religion, but is al&s;o &s;o impo|litic a crime, as no one who wi&s;hes to be well received in the world would ever commit&mdash;for a per&s;on who is ad|dicted to &s;candal, is a terror to &s;ociety; the re&s;pect they receive, re&s;embles the homage the Indians are &s;aid to pay to the Devil, rather to evade his maligni|ty, than procure his love. And how|ever curio&s;ity may, for a while, li&s;ten to an ill-natured anecdote, yet be a&s;&s;ur|ed, the relator is regarded with a &s;ecret di&s;gu&s;t by every benevolent per&s;on, who naturally expects to meet the &s;ame cen|&s;orious fate, when opportunity &s;erves.</P>
<P>Good policy will therefore correct a cen&s;orious di&s;po&s;ition; yet, I tru&s;t your re&s;traint will be derived from a &s;uperior motive, namely, the obligations of reli|gion, which forbid to &s;peak evil of any,
<PB N="288" REF="033601_0280_0FF7A3AEF40959A0">or to judge uncharitably of another. The con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of having always obeyed the&s;e divine injunctions, will afford the con&s;olation, under the pain you may perhaps feel from the unju&s;t a&s;per&s;ions of others&mdash;for &s;uch, probably, you will meet with in your journey of life, as no innocence can always be a defence from unmerited cen&s;ure; and when this chan|ces to be your ca&s;e, you will derive un|&s;peakable comfort, from the reflection of having treated the world more gene|rou&s;ly than it has treated you.</P>
<P>Whatever you &s;ay, &s;hould be meant for the entertainment or in&s;truction of the company, rather than the gratifica|tion of vanity. Many are &s;o much actu|ated by &s;elf-love, that they never &s;peak or act, but to be applauded. Hence ari|&s;es affectation&mdash;the mo&s;t di&s;gu&s;ting qua|lity in nature. Diliver your &s;entiments as they occur, without affecting more graces in your tone or ge&s;ture than
<PB N="289" REF="033601_0281_0FF7A3B085DEE630">are your own&mdash;the&s;e, well managed, will be enough to render you amiable. All may be agreeable in their natural &s;phere, but when they innovate on that of others, the attempt is commonly fru&s;trated.</P>
<P>Above all, never affect that kind of wit which aims at &s;evere retorts and re|partee&mdash;it has generally ill-nature for its ba&s;is, and &s;eldom makes a &s;ally but it procures an enemy, if it does not lo&s;e a friend. There is nothing in it to be ad|mired but the readine&s;s of thought, which gives it birth&mdash;but when the qua|lity &s;eems <HI>aimed</HI> at, rather than <HI>po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed,</HI> it is ab&s;olutely contemptible.</P>
<P>In fine&mdash;&s;incerity, candour, and good &s;en&s;e, mu&s;t be the ornaments of your conver&s;ation. Politene&s;s will give an agreeable lu&s;tre to the&s;e qualities, but remember, it can never be a &s;ub&s;titute for them.</P>

<P>"HAIL politene&s;s, power divine!" &s;ays the &s;onnet, and &s;urely no nece&s;&s;ary invocation; for politene&s;s, dear girls, is the friend of &s;ocial happine&s;s and dome|&s;tic peace; if it was the fa&s;hion, in this age, to have hou&s;ehold gods, I would &s;urely give it a pre-eminent place among&s;t them.</P>
<P>I know not how it happens, but peo|ple &s;eem to think, they are obliged to be polite every where but at home&mdash;and there it is they are mo&s;t required to be &s;o; for the refined &s;atisfaction of &s;o|cial intercour&s;e, cannot long &s;ub&s;i&s;t with|out it. I am convinced, that dome&s;tic quarrels and di&s;gu&s;ts, would much &s;el|domer ari&s;e, if the parties were always as polite as affectionate.</P>
<P>But what is politene&s;s&mdash;is it the law of fa&s;hion, or a &s;y&s;tem of rules?&mdash;No&mdash;it
<PB N="291" REF="033601_0283_0FF7A3B6EB1F4A98">is the divine principle of benevolence, branched into a thou&s;and little chan|nels, and flowing through all the mi|nutiae of human life. Education may improve, but can never give it, for it mu&s;t be founded in the &s;oul, or is never &s;een in full perfection. A painter may learn the rules of de&s;ign, and the com|pendium of colours; but if he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es not the enthu&s;ia&s;m of the art, his pic|tures will be lifele&s;s and in&s;ipid.</P>
<P>Politene&s;s is that a miable di&s;po&s;ition, which delights in the happine&s;s of others&mdash;con&s;ults their ea&s;e&mdash;prevents their wants&mdash;and yields them every po&s;&s;ible convenience. This is the &s;ource of tho&s;e civilities and attentions, which di&s;tin|gui&s;h a well-bred per&s;on&mdash;without it, etiquette dwindles into unmeaning cere|mony.</P>
<P>You perceive then, that not only an attention to external graces, but a regu|lation
<PB N="292" REF="033601_0284_0FF7A3B878FB1110">of the di&s;po&s;ition is nece&s;&s;ary to con&s;titute a polite per&s;on. Acquire the amiable temper I have de&s;cribed, and you will infallibly plea&s;e with that na|tive ea&s;e which is thought &s;o requi&s;ite to be attained, that the world has &s;ub|&s;tituted in its room its wretched re&s;em|blance, effrontery:&mdash;but no more like the amiable original, than an ordinary &s;tatue to the Venus of Medicis.</P>
<P>I have often thought, that the be&s;t Chri&s;tian is likely to be the mo&s;t polite per&s;on. This is an a&s;&s;ertion you have not been u&s;ed to hear, yet may well enough be warranted by the tenor of the go&s;pel precepts, which inculcate the being ten|der of another's weakne&s;s&mdash;to prefer each other in honor&mdash;to give re&s;pect where due&mdash;with others to the like purpo&s;e. Now if the&s;e excellent le&s;&s;ons contain (as I think will be allowed) the &s;ub&s;tance of what, at this day, is termed good breeding. St. Paul mu&s;t be a better

<P>NOTHING is more talked of than religion&mdash;nothing le&s;s under&s;tood&mdash;with|out comprehending what it really is, the &s;pirit of bigotry would arrogate the whole, nor allow of its being without the contra|cted pale of a particular &s;ect.</P>
<P>I have ju&s;ter notions of religion&mdash;&s;ee it as it is&mdash;not a mode of ceremonies, but a divine principle influencing the whole moral conduct; its &s;imple, fixed and de|terminate &s;en&s;e, is briefly love of God, and good will to mankind. This, dear girls, is the &s;um of all religion; without it, vain were the oblations of the Jewi&s;h church&mdash;vain are the ceremonials of the Chri&s;tian.</P>
<P>The "love of God," is an expre&s;&s;ion that, of late years, has been as gro&s;&s;ly abu|&s;ed as the word religion. Strange as it may
<PB N="295" REF="033601_0287_0FF77EB8FB519BA0">appear, there have been tho&s;e, who lead|ing the mo&s;t immoral lives, have &s;tiled them&s;elves the lovers of the God of puri|ty&mdash;who&s;e tongues could utter a pious eja|culation, while their hands were com|mitting the mo&s;t flagitious crimes. But be not deceived&mdash;this exalted character belongs neither to bigotry nor enthu&s;i|a&s;m. The love of God is not a pa&s;&s;ion, but a rational principle; it is tho&s;e &s;enti|ments of reverence and gratitude, which naturally ari&s;e in a generous mind when reflecting on one &s;upreme beneficent pow|er, who is the immediate author of all good, and the fountain of all perfection. This conviction is the parent of unaffect|ed piety; the &s;oul cannot but adore the Being &s;he believes to be all-wi&s;e, almigh|ty, and eternal;&mdash;&s;he cannot but love him who is the &s;ource of unnumbered ble&s;&s;ings; nor chu&s;e, but dread to offend him who&s;e nature &s;he believes to be holi|ne&s;s. Hence the &s;ource of moral virtue&mdash;&s;in is avoided, becau&s;e di&s;plea&s;ing to the
<PB N="296" REF="033601_0288_0FF7A3C1F58969F0">will of the Deity; and virtuous di&s;po&s;i|tions are acquired, becau&s;e agreeable to a Power who is able to reward every endea|vour to plea&s;e him, with eternal and un|&s;peakable happine&s;s.</P>
<P>Such a filial, rational love, mu&s;t be the fruit of every mind that is not ignorant of the being and attributes of God;&mdash;or that has not received from bigotry or &s;u|per&s;tition, any mi&s;taken notions of him. To prevent being di&s;turbed by the &s;piri|tual pride of hypocritical fanatics, remem|ber there is an invariable te&s;t by which you may know if you have the love of God. A&s;k your own heart, if it &s;eeks the favour of the Deity above every other con&s;ideration? If it values this more than its deare&s;t intere&s;ts, and even life it&s;elf, a ready affirmative puts the que&s;tion out of all doubt.</P>
<P>Be a&s;&s;ured, my dear girls, that nothing &s;o highly elevates and adorns
<PB N="297" REF="033601_0289_0FF7A3C389A2CC00">the human character, as a &s;teady ration|al piety&mdash;nor is any thing capable of yielding &s;o pure and exalted a happine&s;s to the &s;oul, as an habit of devotion. No one who has experienced the vici&s;&s;itude of &s;ublunary things, but mu&s;t highly value the privilege of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing a friend, that would at all times be acceptable&mdash;ready to hear the complaints of affliction, and all powerful to relieve them.</P>
<P>Such a friend you may enjoy in the Divine Being; of what con&s;equence is it then that you acquire a ta&s;te for the exerci&s;es of devotion; that you cultivate a friend&s;hip with heaven, and accu&s;tom your hearts to talk with God. This is an emphatical expre&s;&s;ion of David, and gives you an idea of rational and &s;incere prayer&mdash;which con&s;i&s;ts not in formal addre&s;&s;es, but is the genuine language of the heart. Such a divine intimacy has &s;omething in it extremely &s;uitable to the noble&s;t &s;en&s;ations of the &s;oul; and
<PB N="298" REF="033601_0290_0FF7A3C5F65A0448">therefore may well be &s;ought after as a &s;ource of refined and exqui&s;ite felicity.

<P>THE generality of people &s;tyle them|&s;elves Chri&s;tians, without under&s;tanding the value or the nece&s;&s;ity of chri&s;tianity; and perhaps neither the one nor the other can be &s;een in a proper light, without taking a comparative view of the human &s;oul before and after the fall.</P>
<P>It is not for my humble pen to illu&s;trate the excellency of a &s;y&s;tem which has God him&s;elf for its author&mdash;nor is it my de&s;ign to attempt a ta&s;k &s;o far above my abilities: yet that you may not wholly take your re|ligion upon tru&s;t, I would call your atten|tion to what man was when fir&s;t created.</P>
<P>But a little inferior to angels, his rea&s;on was clear, his &s;oul all purity, and his mind all intelligence&mdash;fit companion for natures wholly &s;piritual, and enjoying the mo&s;t familiar intercour&s;e with them. That
<PB N="300" REF="033601_0292_0FF7A3CB1F820A40">grand que&s;tion which has &s;ince agitated the &s;chools of philo&s;ophy, of what was the chief good of man, was all apparent to the fir&s;t of the human race: he &s;aw perfectly clear, that it con&s;i&s;ted in the entire a&s;&s;imi|lation of his will to that of the Deity&mdash;and in the pur&s;uit found a full unmixed felici|ty. But he was created with the power of doing otherwi&s;e, or where would have been the merit of obedience? The duty of free agency, mu&s;t be far preferable to that which ari&s;es from blind nece&s;&s;ity.</P>
<P>Adam continued a happy being as long as his will remained con&s;onant to that of his Maker; but at the in&s;tant it deviated therefrom, he fell from happine&s;s and per|fection. The conci&s;ene&s;s of the &s;cripture hi&s;tory, leaves unthinking minds in doubt as to the nature of Adam's tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, but undoubtedly it originated in the mere de&s;ire of doing contrary to the divine com|mand;&mdash;he forgot that the Diety was his happine&s;s, and he &s;ought it in his own will.
<PB N="301" REF="033601_0293_0FF7A3CCABE51750">It was herein he &s;inned, and not &s;imply by eating the forbidden fruit, for at the very moment Adam became capable of imagining there might be a good ab&s;tract from the favour of God&mdash;that moment he fell.</P>
<P>The Creator &s;aw at one comprehen&s;ive view, the mi&s;eries which would accrue to mankind, from the voluntary perver&s;ion of the intellectual and moral powers;&mdash; then was the &s;cheme of Chri&s;tianity devi&s;|ed, as an effectual means of re&s;toring hu|man nature to the happine&s;s and perfection it originally po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. The purpo&s;ed ble&s;&s;ing was graciou&s;ly announced in that prediction, that the po&s;terity of Eve &s;hould cru&s;h the &s;erpent's head.</P>
<P>The human rea&s;on thus clouded, it is almo&s;t &s;urpri&s;ing to reflect by what rapid &s;teps the world became immer&s;ed in the wor&s;t ignorance and vice. Tho&s;e who &s;till retained &s;ome idea of the Sovereign Crea|tor,
<PB N="302" REF="033601_0294_0FF7A468B9A47070">had recour&s;e to a vi&s;ible &s;ymbol of his Maje&s;ty; for their intellectual faculties were too gro&s;s to apprehend an immateri|al Deity&mdash;it &s;oon happened that the &s;ym|bol it&s;elf was made the object of divine wor&s;hip; and hence, doubtle&s;s, the origin of idolatry, which in the time of Abraham had &s;o generally &s;pread over the earth, that it appeared nece&s;&s;ary to the Supreme Governor of the Univer&s;e to call that good man from his country and his kindred to ordain him the father of a nation; who being, by numerous and peculiar laws, &s;e|parated from the re&s;t of the would, might pre&s;erve, uncorrupt, the knowledge of the Divine Nature. The Bible will convince you how ineffectual, not only the&s;e laws, but the frequent and &s;ignal manife&s;tations of Almighty power were to &s;ecure that people from the gro&s;&s;e&s;t idolatry, the rights of which were now become &s;o terrible to the imagination, that they even burnt their children alive, in &s;acrifices to their horrid idols. What a picture is here of human
<PB N="303" REF="033601_0295_0FF77ECDA82F6250">nature! that nature which once &s;o nearly approached the angelic! Do you not be|gin to &s;ee the nece&s;&s;ity of a Redeemer? Let us pur&s;ue the thread of hi&s;tory, and take a &s;uperficial view of the mo&s;t cele|brated nations which peopled the earth before the glorious aera of his appearance.</P>
<P>The Egyptians were very early e&s;teem|ed for learning, laws and arts&mdash;they were a numerous, powerful, and wealthy people, but &s;o gro&s;sly idolatrous, that they not on|ly wor&s;hipped images, but bea&s;ts, in&s;ects, and even vegetables. The manufactures and exten&s;ive commerce of Phoenicia, &s;up|po&s;e &s;ome advance in refinement&mdash;but national intercour&s;e in tho&s;e wretched times &s;erved but to promulgate national idolatries. Babylon, that mighty &s;eat of empire &s;urpa&s;&s;ed mo&s;t other nations in the &s;uperb materials of her Gods. A&s;trono|mers there ob&s;erved the motions of the Heavens, and bowed in adoration to the &s;plendid ho&s;ts that adorned them. Cyrus,
<PB N="304" REF="033601_0296_0FF77ECF37BD64D8">who erected the Per&s;ian on the ruins of the Babyloni&s;h Monarchy, knew nothing of the Almighty Being who named him, an age before he had exi&s;tence, as the in|&s;trument of Liberty to his captive people. Alexander, who in his turn &s;ubverted this exten&s;ive empire, could only blend his Grecian idols with the Per&s;ian&mdash;for dark, deplorably dark, was every corner of the habitable earth, except the incon&s;iderable land of Jukea, where only a few de&s;pi&s;ed, enfeebled tribes, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the light of &s;a|cred knowledge.</P>
<P>What a &s;pectacle for the Father of the univer&s;e! who produced a world to know him and be happy! how much mu&s;t his divine compa&s;&s;ion be excited, on contem|plating his glorious work in ruins!&mdash;to redeem it was an effort worthy of him&s;elf.</P>
<P>We now come to the enlightened ages of Greece and Rome&mdash;a period when I fancy I &s;ee the human &s;oul like a brilliant
<PB N="305" REF="033601_0297_0FF77ED183CD30B8">gem, illu&s;trious in the du&s;t. What noble &s;truggles did then the human rea&s;on make to free it&s;elf from the incumbent load or darkne&s;s and error! Then lived tho&s;e nu|merous worthies, who&s;e names are yet precious to po&s;terity. What greatne&s;s of &s;oul&mdash;what a ta&s;te for &s;olid glory&mdash;what elevated &s;entiments did they not di&s;co|ver? Yet the&s;e men, &s;o far &s;uperior to the re&s;t of their &s;pecies, acknowledged a mul|tiplicity of deities, who&s;e moral charac|ters were infinitely inferior to their own, and to whom they &s;crupled not to a&s;cribe actions which them&s;elves would have blu&s;h|ed to acknowledge. Every pa&s;&s;ion of the human mind was per&s;onified, and deified; &s;tatues graced every corner of their &s;treets. Yet were there not wanting &s;ome among them who made bold advances in &s;earch of better informati&ograve;n&mdash;like benighted tra|vellers, they followed the mo&s;t di&s;tant gleam of light, yet all they could obtain was doubt and ob&s;curity.</P>
<P><PB N="306" REF="033601_0298_0FF77EEC236343E0">
At this period, when rea&s;on had done all it could do to regain its native rights and privileges&mdash;the Saviour of the world appeared, at who&s;e &s;acred pre&s;ence idola|try fled, and the knowledge of the one true God began to enlighten mankind. They were no longer compelled to en|quire, "Where is God our maker?" They knew him, and were in&s;tructed in his di|vine wor&s;hip. The doctrines which the divine Me&s;&s;iah taught, eminently tended to re&s;tore human nature to the rectitude and happine&s;s it had lo&s;t&mdash;they were calcula|ted to harmonize the pa&s;&s;ions, regulate the affections, and exalt the &s;oul to a &s;en&s;e of her own dignity, by revealing in the clear|e&s;t terms, the immortality of her nature&mdash;a point which philo&s;ophy had long &s;ought to explore through the dim veil of pro|bable conjecture.</P>

<PB N="307" REF="033601_0299_0FF7A3CE5B7DEB08">even in the pre&s;ent life. Con&s;ider the benevolence and charity they incul|cate&mdash;the patience, meekne&s;s, moderation, contempt of worldly plea&s;ures and enjoy|ments, the generous clemency to ene|mies; with the re&s;t of that bright a&s;&s;em|blage of virtues they enjoin, and you will confe&s;s it a matter of wonder that the felicity of Eden is not already re&s;tored to tho&s;e countries where the religion of Chri&s;t is profe&s;&s;ed&mdash;and the rea&s;on it is not &s;o can be none other, than that of the thou|&s;ands who daily make profe&s;&s;ion of it, &s;o few have a competent knowledge of its na|ture and de&s;ign. Born in a Chri&s;tian land, they think &s;uch a &s;crutiny &s;uperfluous. Thus they call them&s;elves Chri&s;tians, with|out having any thing of the &s;pirit of Chri&s;t. &mdash;And thus the human race is &s;till ob|noxious to a thou&s;and mi&s;eries, for want of applying to them&s;elves the remedy which alone could put an end to moral evil.</P>
<P><PB N="308" REF="033601_0300_0FF7A3D2D6157140">
May you, my dear girls, be effectually convinced of the ine&s;timable value of this divine di&s;pen&s;ation, and think with Dr. Young, that
<Q>"A Chri&s;tian is the highe&s;t &s;tyle of man."</Q></P>
<P>There are no virtuous di&s;po&s;itions&mdash;no generous affections&mdash;no truly noble &s;entiments, that are not compri&s;ed in that &s;ublime character. Po&s;&s;e&s;s it, my young friends, for no higher di&s;tinction, or grea|ter felicity, can po&s;&s;ibly be wi&s;hed you by CORNELIA.</P>

<P>"It appears from the dedication, that the Editor of this plea&s;ing publication, in the Rev. William Ro|berts, A. M. F. A. S. Fellow of Corpus Chri&s;ti College, Oxford; and from the la&s;t Number, that the labour, and con&s;equently the merit of the&s;e Papers, have re&s;ted with the Editor, excepting only a few contributions particularly mentioned. The Editor's de&s;ign has been, as he repre&s;ents it, 'To &s;ub&s;titute the for&s;aken topics of morality, literature, and ta&s;te, in the room of &s;hallow politic and new&s;paper philo&s;o|phy, and to betray men under the ma&s;k of amu&s;ement, into &s;erious and manly thoughts.' The de&s;ign was laudable, and the execution was meritorious. As literary productions, the&s;e periodical Papers are en|titled to di&s;tinction; but their highe&s;t prai&s;e is, that they are throughout calculated to promote virtue and good manners."</P></NOTE></ITEM>
