</EPIGRAPH>
<OPENER><SALUTE>YOUNG MEN,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ACCORDING to my promi&s;e, I have prepared an addre&s;s, to you in particular. And, as I have been induced to pay you this re&s;pect, from an affectionate concern for your happine&s;s, I may the more rea&s;onably hope, that you will hear me with attention, candor and &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s. Without this, the great object of my labor will be lo&s;t, and my earne&s;t de&s;ires painfully di&s;appointed. Oblige me then &s;o far, as to keep your minds open to in&s;truc|tion, and conviction; and then, by the ble&s;&s;ing of God, I per&s;uade my&s;elf, we &s;hall have rea&s;on to rejoice together.</P>
<P>The words I have read contain a very important que&s;tion directly to my purpo&s;e, "Wherewithal &s;hall a young man clean&s;e his way?" What cour&s;e of life &s;hall he pur&s;ue, and by what rule &s;hall he be guided, in order to e&s;cape tho&s;e irregularities and evils to which youth is ever expo&s;ed?</P>
<P>The que&s;tion evidently implies that his &s;ituation is attended with peculiar danger; and that he has neither knowledge, nor experience, nor any com|mand over him&s;elf, &s;ufficient to &s;ecure his &s;afety&mdash; and therefore, that he &s;tands in need of &s;uch a rule as is both capable of pointing out his duty, in all
<PB N="4" REF="046207_0004_1020F8B072F038E0">
circum&s;tances, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of authority to reach and determine his con&s;cience. This rule is imme|diately propo&s;ed, in the an&s;wer to the que&s;tion, "By taking heed thereto according to thy word."</P>
<P>Taking this for his guide, with a con&s;cientious regard to his duty, the whole of his life &s;hall be virtuous, honorable and happy. From this view of the text, I propo&s;e to con&s;ider,</P>
<P N="1">I. The principal things which young men are to attend to, in order to maintain a pure and un|blameable cour&s;e of life.</P>
<P N="2">II. The rule which they are ever to place before them, as the &s;tandard of their temper and conduct.</P>
<P N="1">1. The principal things, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Under the fir&s;t head, I &s;hall con&s;ider in this di&s;cour&s;e, the duty of early piety, and its princi|pal advantages; the duty and advantages of early engaging in u&s;eful employment; and the nece&s;&s;ity of a prudent choice of company.</P>
<P N="1">1. The fir&s;t thing which claims your regard is piety or religion. By this I mean, not only tho&s;e acts of homage which are immediately due to God, but every part of our duty, as fixed by his autho|rity, including as well the principles on which it is performed, as the outward acts.</P>
<P>Every obligation of divine appointment, is a part of religion; and though &s;ome are &s;uperior in dignity to others, with regard to their imme|diate objects; yet all are equally to be regarded in practice, &s;o as that no one is to be neglected, under pretence of di&s;charging another. And in|deed this can never be nece&s;&s;ary, becau&s;e the whole &s;y&s;tem of our duties are &s;o framed, as to be per|fectly con&s;i&s;tent with each other. If one be ne|glected,
<PB N="5" REF="046207_0005_1020ECAB260FC258">
it is di&s;obedience to the authority on which the whole are founded; and the guilty per|&s;on is as really a tran&s;gre&s;&s;or, though not in &s;o high a degree, as if he had broken every individual law, "For who&s;oever &s;hall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all." I mention this the more particularly, as in all ages men have been ready to &s;uppo&s;e, that if they wor|&s;hipped God, it would go in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter">oom of their duties to mankind; and &s;o while they have prayed, fa&s;ted, and paid tithes, they have "neglected ju&s;tice, mercy and fidelity," to their neighbour. Or they have gone into the oppo&s;ite error, and con|cluded, that ju&s;tice, mercy and fidelity to men, were the whole of religion; and &s;o neglected the nece&s;&s;ary acts of direct homage to God. But cer|tainly, for the &s;ame rea&s;on that we are to acknow|ledge and wor&s;hip God, as an expre&s;s part of our duty, we are to &s;tudy the good of others and our|&s;elves, in that way which he hath pre&s;cribed, as equally a matter of con&s;cience and obligation. It is further to be con&s;idered, that the principle on which any duty is performed, is as much to be regarded, as the act it&s;elf. Indeed there is pro|perly no religion in any act whatever, but &s;o far as it is done from a right intention, that is, always with a view to the will and plea&s;ure of God. The act is but the form, the intention or principle is the &s;ub&s;tance.</P>
<P>It was for this rea&s;on, that the tithes, alms and prayers of the Phari&s;ees were of no account in the &s;ight of God; becau&s;e they did them "to be &s;een of men." And of the &s;ame quality will be every form of religion, how exact &s;oever, when "the heart is not right with him."</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="046207_0006_1020F8B36DDFC640">This di&s;tinction I wi&s;h you the more carefully to attend to, becau&s;e there is no mi&s;take more common, and none more fatal, than to re&s;t in a "form of godline&s;s without the power." Should you fall into this mi&s;take, it will ruin the whole of your religion, however plau&s;ible in appearance, and leave you at la&s;t, as far from God and Heaven, as they who have lived without even the form of it.</P>
<P>You are al&s;o to remember, that &s;ince the coming of Chri&s;t, it is as much a duty to tho&s;e who enjoy the go&s;pel, to believe in him, to wor&s;hip through him, and to hope for &s;alvation by his merits, as to obey the fir&s;t command, "to wor&s;hip God, and him only to &s;erve." This is &s;o nece&s;&s;ary, that neither our prayers, nor prai&s;es, nor confe&s;&s;ions, nor any other &s;ervice will be accepted, on any other terms. And it is &s;o far from being le&s;t to the liberty of men, to reject it if they plea&s;e, as a matter referred entirely to their own option; that nothing is more expre&s;sly enjoined, than to believe in, and obey him&punc; and nothing threatened with an heavier penalty, than to refu&s;e to acknowledge and re|ceive him. "Je&s;us came into Galilee, preaching the go&s;pel of the kingdom of God, and &s;aying, repent ye, and believe the go&s;pel." "He that believeth not is condemned already." "If ye be|lieve not that I am he, ye &s;hall die in your &s;ins." This is his commandment, "that we &s;hould be|lieve in the name of his &s;on Je&s;us Chri&s;t." The &s;ub&s;tance of the religion of the go&s;pel is, that we "live &s;oberly, righteou&s;ly, and godly, in this pre|&s;ent evil world;" "and what&s;oever ye do, whether in word, or in deed, do all in the name of the Lord Je&s;us, giving thanks unto God, even the father by him."</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="046207_0007_1020F8647B2EA668">It is by this that your actions, words, pa&s;&s;ions, and thoughts, and all your views and mea&s;ures for this and another world, are to be governed, and determined as good or bad, in the &s;ight of God. You cannot therefore, be too careful, to obtain a ju&s;t knowledge of the duties it pre&s;cribes, of the authority and &s;anctions by which they are enforced, and the great and everla&s;ting advantages they afford. And &s;o far as you di&s;cover your duty, or, after due examination, think that you di&s;cover it, whether it be in appearance, of greater or &s;maller moment, make it a matter of con&s;cience to do it, becau&s;e all obligations are equal, with re&s;pect to the authority of God; and if you neglect the dic|tates of con&s;cience in one in&s;tance, you will do it in another; till by degrees it will cea&s;e to be the rule of your conduct; and &s;o you will be "de|&s;troyed by little and little."</P>
<P>After this &s;hort view of the religion of the go&s;|pel, on which all your happine&s;s depends, you will naturally inquire at what time of life you come under its obligations. As &s;oon undoubtedly, as you are capable of under&s;tanding them, and feeling the force of tho&s;e motives by which they are urged. And I &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e this to be the ca&s;e, as &s;oon as the mind is capable of being affected by the ad|vantages of the world, and of forming &s;chemes for obtaining them. This in different per&s;ons, may happen at different times; but is much &s;ooner in all, than any are willing to think a proper a &s;ea|&s;on for becoming re&s;pon&s;ible to the laws of God, and &s;ubmitting to the re&s;traints of religion. It is a common prejudice of youth, and the &s;ource of almo&s;t all the errors of their &s;ucceeding life, that they are under le&s;s obligation to be religious, than tho&s;e of advanced years; that di&s;&s;ipation and gaiety
<PB N="8" REF="046207_0008_1020F8B69408CCA8">
are more &s;uitable to their e&s;tate of life, than the gravity, thoughtfulne&s;s and cares of religion, and that they are le&s;s in need of it, than when they will be more liable to afflictions and death, and le&s;s capable of enjoying the world. If this were even true, it is equally &s;o, that youth is expo&s;ed to every calamity that affects the &s;ucceeding ages of life; and are therefore both in need of tho&s;e &s;up|ports which religion alone can give, and bound to &s;ecure them as early as they may be obtained. Be|&s;ides, if it be their duty to repay the care and tenderne&s;s of their earthly parents, with the ear|lie&s;t expre&s;&s;ions of gratitude, love and obedience they are capable of; much more certainly, the love and goodne&s;s of God, "in whom they live, and move and have their being." Or can it be &s;up|po&s;ed. that at that time of life, when it is criminal to neglect or di&s;obey a parent, it is not &s;o to neglect and di&s;obey the father of our &s;pirits? Certainly, no. Neither can it ever be with rea&s;on &s;uppo&s;ed, that we do not come under obligations to regard the authority of God, till that time of life, when we cea&s;e to be under that of our parents. The truth is, that the objections of youth again&s;t early reli|gion are &s;o far from being well founded, that they originate in a de&s;ire of all others the mo&s;t unrea&s;on|able and pernicious, that of living without any re&s;traint on their inclinations and pur&s;uits, and &s;o would wi&s;h to put that off to the la&s;t, which in point of importance and nece&s;&s;ity is fir&s;t.</P>
<P>But, without rea&s;oning farther on the &s;ubject, it will appear, that &s;o many advantages ari&s;e from it, that independent of other con&s;iderations, to neglect it, is to undervalue and &s;light our happi|ne&s;s, to con&s;ult which God hath made one e&s;&s;en|tial part of our duty.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="046207_0009_1020F8662BE18158">Advantages of early religion.</P>
<P N="1">1. The difficulties which attend the entrance on a cour&s;e of piety, are in youth, u&s;ually &s;ooner, and more ea&s;ily &s;urmounted.</P>
<P>The con&s;cience is more &s;u&s;ceptive of conviction, the affections &s;ofter and more pliant, and more apt to be affected with the con&s;ideration of the love and mercy of God. There are fewer bad pa&s;&s;ions and principles in operation, fewer engagements with the world, and fewer and le&s;s inveterate habits of &s;in to oppo&s;e and reform.</P>
<P>It is true, that the power of "God who worketh in us both to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="2 letters">ll and to do, of his own good plea|&s;ure," can as ea&s;ily affect and change the heart, at one age of life, and at any po&s;&s;ible degree of guilt, within the bounds of mercy, as another; yet, in this and every other ca&s;e, we are not to con&s;ider what is po&s;&s;ible for him to do; but what he u&s;ually doth. Agreeably to this, it appears to be matter of fact, that the greate&s;t number of tho&s;e who "have pa&s;&s;ed from death to life," where the go&s;pel has been &s;tatedly di&s;pen&s;ed, has been under the time of middle life. To this purpo&s;e Dr. Doddridge remarks, that the mo&s;t of tho&s;e who were hopefully converted by his mini&s;try, in the congregation where he re&s;ided, were under the age of twenty-four.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the eighth of his ten &s;ermons on regeneration.</NOTE> And though there are every where, in&s;tances of the triumph of the grace of God, at a much later period; yet, they are &s;o few, in compari&s;on of tho&s;e which happen earlier, as to &s;hew in the mo&s;t forcible light, the importance of cheri&s;hing religious impre&s;&s;ions, in that &s;ea&s;on of life which is found by experience, to be the be&s;t adopted to retain them.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="10" REF="046207_0010_1020F8B81EB38328">2. It is very difficult to break off from habits of &s;in that have been long in force.</P>
<P>We are influenced by habit, in a manner that cannot well be exp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="4 letters">ed. So great is its power over us, that where its effects are mo&s;t obvious, and prejudicial to our happine&s;s, we often continue in what we even wi&s;h and determine to relinqui&s;h. And it is no doubt, in a great mea&s;ure, owing to this circum&s;tance, that there are &s;o few in&s;tances of effectual reformation, after the &s;ea&s;on of youth has elap&s;ed. Of tho&s;e who attempt it, the greate&s;t part, after weak and irre&s;olute efforts, u&s;ually go back, by degrees, till they get quite into their old habits of tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion; and there continue, for the remainder of life, without perhaps, trying again to recover. So ju&s;t and agreeable to expe|rience are the words of the prophet, "Can the Ethiopian change his &s;kin, or the leopard his &s;pots? Then may ye al&s;o do good, that are accu&s;|tomed to evil." Nor need it be wondered at, if we con&s;ider the hard&s;hip and &s;elf-denial it co&s;ts even youth, to correct habits of only a few years &s;tand|ing, and fall into new and oppo&s;ite cour&s;es of living. The advantages however, are &s;o much on this &s;ide, that they ought effectually to determine you, before your hearts have become "hardened by &s;in," and bad habits have acquired an incorrigible influence over you, to endeavor to &s;all into tho&s;e which you will never have occa&s;ion to alter; and which will gradually become ea&s;ier and ea&s;ier, till they will be your choice and delight. "If thou ha&s;t run with the footmen, and they have wearied thee; how wilt thou contend with the hor&s;es? And if in the land of peace wherein thou tru&s;ted&s;t, they wearied thee; what wilt thou do in the &s;wel|lings of Jordan?"</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="046207_0011_1020F867F5C941B0">If you find it now, &s;o difficult to break off from any favorite cour&s;e of life, and deny your&s;elves any &s;inful gratifications to which you have been accu&s;|tomed, what pro&s;pect can you have of reforming, at any future time, when you will not only have to contend with tho&s;e in which you now live, with the additional &s;trength they will then have ac|quired, but probably a great many others?</P>
<P N="3">3. Early religion prevents a great deal of guilt, and con&s;equently, of remor&s;e, and pain of con|&s;cience.</P>
<P>While a man is in the habits of &s;in, he is not only every day increa&s;ing the mea&s;ure of his guilt; but proportionably preparing for him&s;elf "tribu|lation and angui&s;h" of con&s;cience, which &s;ooner or later, he will certainly endure.</P>
<P>They who make them&s;elves the ea&s;ie&s;t in a cour&s;e of tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, have their &s;ea&s;ons of cool and impartial reflexion, when con&s;cience interrupts their repo&s;e, and fills them with inexpre&s;&s;ible un|ea&s;ine&s;s, at the apprehen&s;ion of &s;uffering the righte|ous judgment of God. Were it even po&s;&s;ible for a &s;inner to fall into &s;uch a &s;tate of &s;tupefaction, as to go on to the end of his life, without any remark|able anxiety or remor&s;e; yet, death mu&s;t at length break off his &s;lumbers, and leave him from that moment, to the "preying of the worm that never dies." And it cannot be doubted, that his mi&s;e|ry in &s;uch a &s;tate, mu&s;t be &s;o much the greater, as he enjoyed longer time to increa&s;e and aggravate his &s;ins.</P>
<P>But, &s;uppo&s;ing him by timely repentance, "to e&s;cape from the wrath to come;" even that will be attended with pains and agony of mind, &s;ufficient to de&s;troy for the time, the &s;en&s;e of all pa&s;t enjoy|ments; and will be &s;o much the &s;harper and more
<PB N="12" REF="046207_0012_1020F8BAF5A08400">
di&s;tre&s;&s;ing, as it hath been longer deferred. Even they who break off the earlie&s;t from their &s;ins, endure enough to overbalance all the guilty plea|&s;ures, for which they bartered their peace, and by which they prepared for them&s;elves the whips and &s;corpions of an accu&s;ing con&s;cience.</P>
<P N="4">4. It early opens the way to the e&s;teem and con|fidence of mankind. The&s;e are certainly de&s;irable, not only&punc; as they may generally be con&s;idered as te&s;timonies of merit; but al&s;o, which is of greater importance, as they give the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or the greater opportunity of being u&s;eful to others. In both the&s;e re&s;pect, "a good name is rather to be cho&s;en than great riches, and loving favor than &s;ilver and gold."</P>
<P>With whatever &s;light or contempt loo&s;e and irre|ligious men may affect to &s;peak of religion, and tho&s;e who profe&s;s it, I believe there are few &s;o in|&s;en&s;ible of the difference between virtue and vice, as not to feel a &s;ecret re&s;pect for tho&s;e who&s;e conduct te&s;tifies the purity and integrity of their hearts. To which may be added, that univer&s;ally, in the &s;ame degree as men appear to be influenced by con|&s;cience, and the fear of God, they will be tru&s;ted, in matters of importance, in preference to others, even by tho&s;e who are the furthe&s;t from any preten|&s;ions to religion. And it is particularly to our purpo&s;e, to ob&s;erve, that the longer per&s;ons are known to have lived in the habits of piety, the more they are e&s;teemed, and the more confidently tru&s;ted, which ought perhaps, to be con&s;idered, as in part&punc; the reward of an early compliance with the fir&s;t duty of human nature.</P>
<P N="5">5. It is peculiarly amiable in the &s;ight of God him&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="046207_0013_1020F86BD2167288">The mo&s;t &s;hining talents, the mo&s;t enlarged im|provements, and the mo&s;t agreeable temper and di&s;po&s;ition, are of no e&s;timation with him, in compari&s;on of piety. "He taketh not plea&s;ure in the legs of a man. The lord taketh plea&s;ure in them that fear him, in them that hope in his mer|cy." And, if "he loveth the righteous," however late their repentance, and return to their duty, may we not ju&s;tly &s;uppo&s;e, that the &s;acrifice of youthful inclinations and plea&s;ures, for the duties of religion; and the dedication of our fir&s;t affec|tions, time, and abilities, to the father of our &s;pirits, mu&s;t be the mo&s;t acceptable offering we can pre&s;ent to him? Jo&s;eph re&s;i&s;ting the &s;olicitations of his mi&s;tre&s;s, and Solomon a&s;king wi&s;dom, in pre|ference to "riches, honor, and the life of his ene|mies," mu&s;t in the&s;e circum&s;tances, have been more amiable in the &s;ight of God, than when arrived at the height of their worldly honors; when the for|mer rode in the &s;econd chariot of Pharoah; and the latter &s;at on the throne of David.</P>
<P>Finally, under this head&mdash;</P>
<P>Early piety is an early and effectual provi&s;ion again&s;t the afflictions of life, and the terrors and &s;ting of death.</P>
<P>"Man is born to trouble as the &s;parks fly up|ward;" and he is the happie&s;t who is be&s;t prepared, not only to meet it, with an humble and patient &s;pirit; but to improve it, for the e&s;tabli&s;hment of his piety, and the increa&s;e of his comfort. Thus improved, every affliction is, in effect, a &s;olid ble&s;|&s;ing; and the &s;harper it has been, the more advan|tage it yields. But, it is true religion alone that can thus convert the natural evils of life into the mo&s;t &s;ub&s;tantial good; and make that which is al|ways grievous to the fle&s;h, to "yield the peaceable
<PB N="14" REF="046207_0014_1020F86F75CEEAE8">
fruits of righteou&s;ne&s;s to tho&s;e that are exerci&s;ed thereby."</P>
<P>Youth indeed, is apt to promi&s;e it&s;elf a long ex|emption from pain, di&s;ea&s;e, &s;orrow, and all the other forms of human mi&s;ery; but, how often do they all arrive, in quick &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, long before they were expected; and pierce the heart &s;o much the deeper, as they were &s;uppo&s;ed to be more remote! Again&s;t all the&s;e evils, the comforts of a good con|&s;cience, and the &s;pecial promi&s;es of the go&s;pel, are an effectual defence; come as early, and as unexpec|tedly as they may, and in any &s;hape whatever, they cannot be un&s;ea&s;onable, neither can they hurt the better part of the chri&s;tian.</P>
<P>While they &s;erve to correct the levities of the youthful mind, and di&s;cipline it into patience and humility; they al&s;o quicken it into early activity and zeal in the &s;ervice of God; and prepare it for en|during with firmne&s;s, the trials of middle or declin|ing life. Happy then, are they who are thus early &s;itted by the grace of God, to meet his will in any of the di&s;tre&s;&s;es to which life is &s;ubject!</P>
<P>As to death, there is nothing but piety that can effectually di&s;per&s;e its terrors, or render it &s;afe. And although youth are apt to place it at a great di&s;tance, and &s;uppo&s;e them&s;elves for many years, &s;afe from its arre&s;t; yet, how often doth it &s;eize them, in the mid&s;t of their bloom, gaiety and hopes, and de&s;troy them at once! And what is infinitely more dreadful than to be torn from life in its highe&s;t &s;tate of enjoyment, if taken unprepared, they are undone forever. If, on the contrary, they have, by early piety, &s;ecured an intere&s;t in the merits of Chri&s;t, they are per|fectly &s;afe. They have nothing to regret, leave what they will behind them; &s;ince they are taken

from the evil to come, and go "to he forever with the Lord." The con&s;ideration of &s;uch a &s;tate of &s;ecurity from the power of the la&s;t enemy, who in the&s;e circum&s;tances, "after he hath de&s;troyed the body, hath nothing more that he can do," mu&s;t be a &s;ource of the mo&s;t rational &s;erenity, and prevent a multitude of di&s;quieting apprehen&s;ions, again&s;t which there is no &s;ure defence, but the hope of eternal life.</P>
<P>To have this well grounded, in the time of youth, is to be fixed on a rock, which neither time&punc; nor death can remove. Thus, by early piety, while nothing nece&s;&s;ary even for your pre&s;ent good is given up: every thing important for life and death is &s;ecured. By this every enjoyment is improved, and every affliction converted into an occa&s;ion of "working for you a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory." This will render you honorable in your&s;elves, ornaments to your friends, to &s;ociety, and to the church. It will fit you for acting your parts with propriety and dig|nity, in whatever &s;tation you are placed; will &s;e|cure you the &s;pecial coun&s;el and care of God, in every &s;ituation through life; his pre&s;ence and &s;upport in death; and then fix you in immortal youth, honor and bli&s;s, among the "&s;pirits of the ju&s;t made perfect."</P>
<P>Should you neglect the pre&s;ent &s;ea&s;on, when every thing is favorable to the attainment of this ble&s;&s;edne&s;s, you will daily find new difficulties and di&s;couragements coming in your way. Increa&s;ing cares, new projects and de&s;igns for the world, and above all, habits of &s;in daily &s;trengthening, will bring with them new embara&s;&s;ments.</P>

your purpo&s;es and re&s;olution will become weaker and weaker; till at la&s;t&punc; you will probably give over all trouble and care about the matter; and &s;et|tle into a fatal ea&s;e and &s;ecurity of mind, in which a neglected God may &s;uffer you to remain, till your ca&s;e be beyond remedy.</P>
<P>Your mi&s;ery will then be &s;harpened, by every comfort you have enjoyed, by every affliction you have &s;uffered, and by every admonition you have neglected.</P>
<P>Or &s;hould it plea&s;e God, by a &s;ingular act of mercy, to interpo&s;e and re&s;cue you from your dan|ger, in advanced life, which however no one has rea&s;on to hope for, after deliberately trifling and &s;inning away the &s;ea&s;on of youth, &s;hould that be the ca&s;e, what difficulties will you then have to encounter, that would now be avoided; what ago|nies of con&s;cience, at the remembrance of your wa&s;ted youth, and the mercy of God &s;o long &s;lighted and abu&s;ed; and how often will you be filled with gloomy doubts of your &s;tate, and alarming fears of being left at la&s;t, by the God you &s;o long neglected, "to reap the fruit of your doings!"</P>

<P>Having premi&s;ed the great qualification nece&s;&s;ary for your acting a &s;afe, u&s;eful and honorable part in life. I proceed to the next thing in order, and that is&mdash;</P>
<P N="2">II. To fix early on &s;ome u&s;eful employment.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="046207_0017_1020F87664E075D0">This is equally a matter of duty and importance, which I hope will appear to you, from the following con&s;iderations.</P>
<P N="1">1. Action and bu&s;ine&s;s are nece&s;&s;ary for the health of the body, and for chearfulne&s;s of the mind. The body is &s;o framed, as to require fre|quent and vigorous action to keep the &s;everal parts of it, in a &s;tate &s;uited to perform their re&s;pective offices to advantage, for the good of the whole. Habitual inactivity weakens the &s;prings of life, nouri&s;hes the &s;eeds of pain and di&s;ea&s;e, and is ever accompanied with a langour and flatne&s;s of the &s;pirits, which always render life, in a mea&s;ure in&s;ipid, and often tedious and burden&s;ome.</P>
<P>Nor will amu&s;ement, however active and varied, be &s;ufficient to pre&s;erve the mind in a &s;tate of chear|fulne&s;s, and calm enjoyment. Where it is ince&s;|&s;antly pur&s;ued, as the main bu&s;ine&s;s of life, it cea&s;eth at length, to exite any high emotions of plea&s;ure, and more certainly fatigues and wears out the &s;pirits, than mo&s;t of the u&s;ual employments of life, pur&s;ued for the &s;ame length of time.</P>
<P>In a &s;teady application to bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;hould it be even of the harder and more laborious &s;ort, while vigorous action keeps the channels of life open, and the moving powers of the body properly bra|ced up, firmne&s;s of thought and re&s;olution, joined to &s;elf-approbation and the pro&s;pect of advantage, &s;erve to keep the mind in an habit of chearfulne&s;s, to which the idle and di&s;&s;ipated are utter &s;trangers. It is thus that "the labouring man's &s;leep is &s;weet&punc; whether he eat little or much." And on the&s;e con&s;iderations it is, that no cla&s;s of mankind &s;eem in general, to have more real enjoyment of life, than they who&s;e circum&s;tances oblige them to "earn their bread by the &s;weat of their brow."</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="18" REF="046207_0018_1020F8BDB72D3E80">2. Early employment is nece&s;&s;ary, in order to make a competent provi&s;ion again&s;t the evils of want and dependence.</P>
<P>The&s;e are circum&s;tances to which no man can patiently &s;ubmit, but either by an in&s;uperable indo|lence, or meane&s;s of &s;pirit; or by hard nece&s;&s;ity. Be&s;ides the hard&s;hips and &s;ufferings of the body, in a &s;tate of want, the mind is &s;ubject to di&s;tre&s;&s;ing anxiety; to fretfulne&s;s; to &s;ecret murmuring again&s;t the providence of God; and often prompted to fraud and violence towards others, as the means of relief. And therefore Agur, with great pro|priety, makes it a part of his memorable prayer, that he might be kept as well from the evils of poverty, as of riches, "le&s;t I be poor and &s;teal, and take the name of my God in vain." But &s;eperate from the&s;e, which are the greater evils of &s;uch a &s;tate, the &s;lights, grinding and in&s;ults to which it is expo&s;ed, are always painful and morti|fying to tho&s;e who have not lo&s;t their &s;en&s;ibility, by the habits of &s;uffering. While "the rich hath many friends," to care&s;s or flatter him, to the &s;hame of human nature, "the poor is hated, even of his neighbors.</P>
<P>To provide again&s;t the&s;e evils is a duty which every man owes to him&s;elf; and will always be the aim of tho&s;e who are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of any true greatne&s;s of &s;pirit.</P>
<P>And con&s;idering how full our life is of accidents, that are calculated to di&s;appoint our pur&s;uits, and how liable every employment is to be interrupted by pain, di&s;ea&s;e, infirmity, and a variety of other circum&s;tances, again&s;t which no prudence can defend us; it is nece&s;&s;ary to begin early to bu&s;ine&s;s, and to go on with diligence, while we have the means in our hands. This is e&s;pecially nece&s;&s;ary for tho&s;e
<PB N="19" REF="046207_0019_1020F878466CDA08">
who have nothing or little to depend on, but their own care and good management. To idle away the prime of life, in &s;uch circum&s;tances, is an argu|ment of a mind de&s;titute of all prudence, and fore|ca&s;t, and le&s;s attentive to its own good, than the inferior animals of the creation: who, as &s;oon as they are capable, begin to do &s;omething towards their own &s;upport. What have &s;uch to expect, but to live always in want, without any ju&s;t claim for tho&s;e aids of charity, to which the helple&s;s, and indu&s;trious poor are always entitled. 'This we commanded you, &s;aith the apo&s;tle, to the The&s;&s;alo|nians, that if any would not work, neither &s;hould he eat." And it generally happens&punc; that where men &s;uffer, in con&s;equence of idlene&s;s and di&s;&s;ipa|tion, they meet with le&s;s pity than others; and are more &s;paringly &s;upplied.</P>
<P>Nor is early indu&s;try le&s;s a matter of prudence, and duty, for tho&s;e who begin the world, with the mo&s;t favorable pro&s;pects. The&s;e are &s;o liable to change, by cau&s;es, again&s;t which no human caution can provide, that he is very unwi&s;e, who tru&s;ts to their continuance, without endeavoring to furni&s;h him&s;elf with &s;ome re&s;ource, in ca&s;e of the wor&s;t.</P>
<P>But, independent of other cau&s;es, the be&s;t capi|tal on which a man can &s;et out, mu&s;t unavoidably wa&s;te, without attention and care on his part, to pre&s;erve it.</P>
<P>Many who might always, with a little care, have lived in ca&s;e, or affluence, by an idle and care|le&s;s youth, have been obliged at la&s;t, either to depend on the bounty of others; or to &s;et into bu&s;ine&s;s at a time of life, when every man would wi&s;h to be leaving it off.</P>
<P>A &s;ituation &s;o much the more painful and morti|fying to them, as they were once in a better, and
<PB N="20" REF="046207_0020_1020F8C15DD96350">
have to charge them&s;elves with the cau&s;e of their calamity.</P>
<P N="3">3. It is an excellent defence again&s;t a multi|tude of temptations to which the idle are expo&s;ed.</P>
<P>It is the nature of the human mind always to require &s;omething to employ it. If it have nothing u&s;eful to engage its attention, it will certainly find &s;omething of a different nature. This is e&s;pecially the ca&s;e with young men, who are more &s;trongly impelled to action, than others, and more certainly run into exce&s;&s;es of one kind or another, if their activity be not virtuou&s;ly directed. Under the in|fluence of health, lively pa&s;&s;ions, and the love of plea&s;ure, they are ever in danger, but e&s;pecially when unemployed. It is in this &s;tate that the great foe of virtue and human happine&s;s, finds them mo&s;t open to his artifice, and ready to follow his &s;ugge&s;tions&mdash;and he knows &s;o well, how to im|prove the&s;e circum&s;tances to their ruin, that when he finds them, he &s;eldom fails of his point. It is indeed, highly probable, that &s;ome of the greate&s;t evils which individuals and communities &s;uffer, are the con&s;equences of vicious principles and habits, contracted in the idlene&s;s and di&s;&s;ipation of early life.</P>
<P>Habitual employment by keeping the thoughts regularly engaged, not only prevents many irre|gular affections, and vain, if not vicious de&s;igns; but the evils of wandering and di&s;&s;ipation, which are generally corrupt morals.</P>
<P>While the planter is bu&s;ied on his plantation, the merchant in his &s;tore, the mechanic in his &s;hop, and the &s;tudent among his books, though he &s;hould be de&s;titute of virtuous principles; he has neither the &s;ame lei&s;ure to contrive evil, nor the &s;ame objects to e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="3 letters">te it, nor opportunity of perpetrating it,
<PB N="21" REF="046207_0021_1020F87DC34B3360">
as when he neglects his bu&s;ine&s;s, and is wandering from place to place.</P>
<P>His engagements in his calling are e&s;pecially beneficial, as they &s;erve to guard him again&s;t di&s;|&s;olute company, which is ever fatal to the princi|ples and morals of youth.</P>
<P>In a word, though &s;teady employment will not effectually &s;ecure you from temptation, or vice, it will certainly often &s;ave you from both; and the earlier you engage it, the le&s;s will be your danger of falling into that variety of evils to which idlene&s;s will ever expo&s;e you. And I cannot but remark before I di&s;mi&s;s this article, that the ea&s;ier circum|&s;tances a young man is in, the more nece&s;&s;ary it is, for the &s;afety of his virtue, to be habitually well employed, and the rea&s;on is plain, the more means he has of indulging to ea&s;e, di&s;&s;ipation and plea|&s;ure, the greater temptation he is under to do it.</P>
<P>In narrow and pinching circum&s;tances, though the inclinations &s;hould be bad, for want of the means of gratifying them, and by the nece&s;&s;ity of clo&s;e attention to bu&s;ine&s;s, men are obliged, in many in&s;tances to check them, and &s;o e&s;cape a num|ber of temptations and vices, which a better &s;itu|ation would have brought them under.</P>
<P>In a &s;tate of affluence, or plenty, a young man is particularly expo&s;ed to the evils of much com|pany, exce&s;&s;ive amu&s;ement and diver&s;ion, clubs, en|tertaiments and other fa&s;hionable ways of de&s;troy|ing time, con&s;cience, and happine&s;s; and e&s;pecially &s;o, if he intru&s;ts the management of his affairs to others, and lives di&s;engaged from care and bu&s;ine&s;s. Next to virtue and religion, the be&s;t defence which the rich can have again&s;t the peculiar dangers of their &s;ituation, is u&s;eful and habitual employ|ment.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="046207_0022_1020F8C414CE2048">The la&s;t con&s;ideration to be now mentioned on the &s;ubject is,</P>
<P N="4">4. That it is a duty we owe to others.</P>
<P>We are born in &s;ociety; we depend on it, for the &s;afety of our per&s;ons and propety, and are con|&s;tantly in need of the good will and a&s;&s;i&s;tance of others, for &s;ome of the mo&s;t valuable enjoyments of life. We are therefore bound, in return for the&s;e advantages, to contribute &s;uch a part to the common good, as our places in &s;ociety, and our abilities will enable us to do.</P>
<P>This we are obliged to, as men, on the natural principles of benevolence and gratitude.</P>
<P>As chri&s;tians, we are bound to it, by expre&s;s, and various precepts of the go&s;pel. "Look not every man on his own things; but every man al&s;o, on the things of others."</P>
<P>"As we have opportunity, let us do good to all men," and above all, "thou &s;halt love thy neigh|bour as thy&s;elf." All which undoubtedly intend, that we &s;hould do &s;omething more than entertain benevolent intentions, and good wi&s;hes to the re&s;t of mankind: The&s;e are fir&s;t to be cheri&s;hed, as preparatory principles; and then to be carried into execution, in the mo&s;t exten&s;ive manner in our power.</P>
<P>Our relations, friends and neighbors, the de&s;ti|tute and afflicted, and the community of which we are members, are all entitled to a &s;hare in our good will, and to &s;uch &s;ervices as we can properly render them.</P>
<P>But how is this to be done, without &s;ome pro|fitable employment, that will yield &s;omething more, than what our own nece&s;&s;ities as individuals, or tho&s;e of our immediate connexions, may require? Should we lead indolent and di&s;&s;ipated lives, we
<PB N="23" REF="046207_0023_1020F881682FB840">
&s;hall be &s;o far from being able to a&s;&s;i&s;t others, that we &s;hall not have enough for our own nece&s;&s;ities, and &s;o be liable to fall on the bounty of others, or make u&s;e of fraud or violence, for our &s;upport, which is contrary to the fir&s;t law of the &s;ocial life, "to injure no one." It is therefore the duty of every one, to be engaged in &s;ome way of life, that will, if po&s;&s;ible, enable him to fulfil his obligations to &s;ociety.</P>
<P>If the time of youth, which is the proper &s;ea&s;on for forming de&s;igns for future u&s;efulne&s;s, be trifled away, in idlene&s;s and di&s;&s;ipation; it is hardly to be expected, that much will afterwards be done, either for the community, their connexions, or them|&s;elves.</P>
<P>Should it even happen, which indeed, is but &s;el|dom the ca&s;e, that he who has wa&s;ted the prime of his days, in vanity and idlene&s;s, recover him&s;elf, and become a u&s;eful and indu&s;trious citizen, yet he mu&s;t ever lie under the reproach, of having de|frauded &s;ociety, of the &s;ervices he ought to have rendered it, in the time that he lo&s;t, and of having been, for the whole of that time, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, a detriment and a nui&s;ance to it.</P>
<P>On the whole, you &s;ee that early employment is both a matter of duty, and productive of the mo&s;t important advantages; both the body and the &s;oul are the better for it. And while it tends to independence and plenty, it furni&s;heth the means of gratifying a benevolent heart, in relieving the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, and contributing to the common good. To which may be added, that under the direction of piety, it is an excellent preparative for the higher, more active, and important employments of a better life.</P>

<P>On the &s;ubject before us, it were ea&s;y to have enlarged; but flattering my&s;elf that what hath been &s;aid, will be &s;ufficient to convince you of its importance, I proceed to another, no le&s;s intere&s;t|ing, and that is</P>
<P N="3">III. The nece&s;&s;ity of a prudent choice of com|pany.</P>
<P>We are formed for &s;ociety, are early inclined to it; and from it derive &s;ome of the principal plea|&s;ures we can enjoy.</P>
<P>But, in the &s;ame degree, in which, in &s;ome cir|cum&s;tances, it is conducive to virtue and happine&s;s, in others, it is de&s;tructive of both. A careful and prudent choice will &s;ecure the former; a carele&s;s and imprudent one will as certainly produce the latter.</P>
<P>You will ea&s;ily under&s;tand, that I am not &s;peak|ing of that general intercour&s;e you mu&s;t have with others, in the common occa&s;ions of life; but, of tho&s;e particular connexions you will form, for the freedoms and intimacies of friend&s;hip; or for amu&s;ment and plea&s;ure. In the former ca&s;e you will have to mingle with men at large, as your particular employments, and your duties to &s;ociety may require. In the latter, you will act on your own inclinations and choice, and will therefore, need &s;o much the more caution and re&s;erve. To give you as full a view of the &s;ubject, as my pre&s;ent
<PB N="25" REF="046207_0025_1020F88302B4DB18">
de&s;ign will admit of, allow me to &s;ugge&s;t to you the following con&s;iderations.</P>
<P N="1">1. We in&s;en&s;ibly adopt the &s;entiments and man|ners of tho&s;e with whom we a&s;&s;ociate, on terms of affection and e&s;teem. This is particularly the ca&s;e with youth, who are fonder of plea&s;ing, and more flexible to imitation, than tho&s;e of advanced life. And from this circum&s;tance, they have more ad|vantages to expect, from a&s;&s;ociating with tho&s;e of virtuous &s;entiments and habits; and more injury to fear from the unprincipled and di&s;&s;olute.</P>
<P>Indeed, it will be almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible, to keep up an habit of intercour&s;e with per&s;ons of either of the above de&s;criptions, in that free and confident manner which is natural to youth, without being in &s;ome degree, the better or the wor&s;e, for it.</P>
<P>If you choo&s;e for your intimates, per&s;ons of ju&s;t &s;entiments of religion, of a benevolent temper, and &s;ober conver&s;ation and morals, you will naturally, from the de&s;ire of plea&s;ing, be induced to conform your&s;elves, in a mea&s;ure, to their way of thinking, &s;peaking, and acting. As your love and e&s;teem of them increa&s;e, your de&s;ire of imitating them will in&s;en&s;ibly increa&s;e al&s;o, till you will probably, by degrees, become the &s;ame &s;ort of per&s;ons, and be fixed in the love and practice of the good qualities you di&s;cover in them.</P>
<P>On the &s;ame principle, if you a&s;&s;ociate freely with tho&s;e of bad &s;entiments and cour&s;es, and e&s;pe|cally, if you enter with them into the intimacies of friend&s;hip; you will as naturally be influenced to imitate them&mdash;and perhaps, &s;o much the more readily, as a bad example has commonly more in|fluence than a good one.</P>
<P>If your minds have not been early &s;ea&s;oned with religious in&s;truction, and impre&s;&s;ed by the force of
<PB N="26" REF="046207_0026_1020F8C947E1D280">
a &s;erious and good example, you will &s;o much the &s;ooner be de&s;troyed by your company.</P>
<P>But, &s;uppo&s;ing a more favorable ca&s;e, that you have had the be&s;t in&s;truction, and the mo&s;t per&s;ua|&s;ive example, and that, under their influence you enter the world, in love with virtue and religion, and free from the taint of corrupt principles and habits; even in this ca&s;e, &s;o in&s;inuating is bad example, and &s;o flexible the heart to evil, that it will be as difficult for you, e&s;pecially under the prejudices of friend&s;hip, not to be le&s;s or more influenced by it, as to a&s;&s;ociate freely with per&s;ons under contagious di&s;ea&s;es, and not be infected. And it will be &s;o much the more difficult to pre&s;erve your innocence, in &s;uch circum&s;tances, as you are of a more benevolent and un&s;u&s;picious temper.</P>
<P>This, which is generally the temper of youth, and which is always improved by religion, will di&s;po&s;e you to compliances, for the &s;ake of obliging, which though not criminal in them&s;elves, may in&s;en&s;ibly lead you on to tho&s;e which are &s;o; till at la&s;t your con&s;cience and your peace may receive a dangerous, if not incurable wound. It is thus that many a youth of promi&s;ing appearances hath been gradually corrupted, till all the fair blo&s;&s;oms of virtue and happine&s;s have decayed, and fallen fruitle&s;s to the ground, while the hopes of parents and friends have peri&s;hed with them. So true and important are the ob&s;ervations, "that evil communications corrupt good manners," and that "a companion of fools &s;hall be de&s;troyed."</P>
<P>It is of importance to ob&s;erve to you&mdash;</P>
<P N="2">2. That when bad connexions are once formed, it is no ea&s;y matter to break off.</P>
<P>The principal concern of youth in forming ac|quaintance and intimates is, to find tho&s;e who po&s;&s;e&s;s

&s;ociability and gaiety of temper. The more &s;olid and u&s;eful qualifications of knowledge, ta&s;te and virtue, are u&s;ually neglected. If their thoughts can be diverted, their &s;pirits enlivened, and new &s;cenes of plea&s;ure and entertainment frequently pre&s;ented, it is &s;ufficient for &s;ecuring their affection and attachment.</P>
<P>In the&s;e circum&s;tances, blind to each others faults, and in&s;en&s;ible of the danger they are in; they &s;eldom think of breaking off, &s;o long as their favo|rite object of plea&s;ure can be &s;ecured. The &s;ame principles which at fir&s;t united them, will operate to continue their union; till either they meet with tho&s;e with whom they are better plea&s;ed, or by &s;ome means, are made &s;en&s;ible of the evil of their &s;ituation. But, if it be difficult to &s;ee this, amid&s;t the care&s;&s;es and blandi&s;hments of friend&s;hip, it is as much more &s;o, to e&s;cape from it, when di&s;covered, as it is ea&s;ier in general to &s;ee the way of duty, than to pur&s;ue it; and as the plea&s;ures of amu&s;e|ment and gaiety have more influence on the heart, than the princples of virtue and religion.</P>
<P>To relinqui&s;h the company of tho&s;e who have often entertained us, diverted anxious thoughts, been the confidants of our free and unre&s;erved &s;entiments, and our a&s;&s;ociates in various &s;cenes of amu&s;ement and plea&s;ure, requires more re&s;olution than u&s;ually falls to the &s;hare of youth, or even of age. An unwillingne&s;s to offend tho&s;e who appear to e&s;teem us, and wi&s;h to make us happy, increa&s;es the difficulty, e&s;pecially with per&s;ons of delicate &s;en&s;i|bility, and genero&s;ity of temper.</P>
<P>And there is another circum&s;tance which too often occurs, of fatal influence, in keeping young men fa&s;t in the chains of vicious and de&s;tructive company, which is this&mdash;that unprincipled and
<PB N="28" REF="046207_0028_1020F8CC097BA490">
di&s;&s;olute men are generally fond of increa&s;ing the number of their a&s;&s;ociates, in order to countenance their vices, and exert the more influence to bring virtue and religion into di&s;credit. With this mo&s;t criminal view, they practi&s;e a variety of arts, to keep in their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion tho&s;e whom they have en|tangled in their &s;ociety. Arguments again&s;t the truth of the go&s;pel, and the obligations of religion, ridicule of gravity and &s;obriety in youth, je&s;ting on &s;erious and religious characters, and in&s;inuations again&s;t the &s;incerity of all who make a profe&s;&s;ion of religion, even where it is mo&s;t exactly &s;upported, are all employed to their diabolical purpo&s;e. And the&s;e arts are the more &s;ucce&s;sful, as they unhappily fall in with that fatal depravity of the mind which di&s;po&s;es it gladly to embrace any thing, however fal&s;e and unrea&s;onable, that gives encouragement to vicious inclination, and &s;erves to loo&s;en the re|&s;traints of con&s;cience.</P>
<P>Should it ever be your unhappine&s;s to be drawn into the &s;ociety of &s;uch men, con&s;ider them as "enemies of all righteou&s;ne&s;s;" who, to encour|age them&s;elves in a cour&s;e of tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, would de&s;troy in your minds, the only principles that can pre&s;erve the good order, and exi&s;tence of &s;ociety, and &s;ave you from falling into eternal mi&s;ery. From the&s;e con&s;iderations, it frequently happens, that when young men have formed bad connexions, they gra|dually lo&s;e all reli&s;h for better and all ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of their duty and intere&s;t or even when &s;en&s;ible of their danger, find them&s;elves under &s;o many engagements, that they have not re&s;olution to break through them. "Enter not then, into the path of the wicked, and go not in the way of evil men. Avoid it, pa&s;s not by it, turn from it and pa&s;s away."</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="046207_0029_1020F888F9995898">As another argument for a prudent and careful choice of company, I mention to you</P>
<P N="3">3. That it is common to judge of men by the characters of tho&s;e with whom they a&s;&s;ociate, and it is a ju&s;t and rea&s;onable way of judging.</P>
<P>In the common employments of life, men are often unavoidably connected, who&s;e principles and habits are in many re&s;pects, not only very different, but quite oppo&s;ite. Yet even in this ca&s;e where no particular friend&s;hip is nece&s;&s;arily &s;uppo&s;ed, they who value their characters will, if po&s;&s;ible, connect them&s;elves with tho&s;e only, who are well e&s;teemed, or at lea&s;t, under no remarkable reproach.</P>
<P>In tho&s;e voluntary a&s;&s;ociations which are formed only for the plea&s;ures of &s;ociety, the ca&s;e is very different. The&s;e always pre&s;uppo&s;e a certain agreement in ta&s;te, &s;entiment and way of life, as the only foundation, and cement of &s;uch connexions. The idle and the bu&s;y, the &s;ober and intemperate, the cha&s;te and the impure, the &s;erious and profane are too much unlike, to be habitual companions. Should &s;uch happen to be connected, the diver&s;ity of their inclinations and manner of life, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily render them &s;o unplea&s;ant to each other, as to prevent a durable friend&s;hip, and intercour&s;e. The&s;e principles are &s;o univer&s;ally acknowledged, that men do not he&s;itate to pronounce, that "a man is &s;uch as the company he frequents."</P>
<P>If your a&s;&s;ociates therefore, are per&s;ons of known &s;obriety and virtue, it will be judged that you po&s;&s;e&s;s the &s;ame qualities. If they are loo&s;e, di&s;&s;i|pated and profane, you will be con&s;idered as the &s;ame &s;ort of per&s;ons. And though aware of this, you &s;hould endeavor to keep up appearances, for &s;ake of your character or intere&s;t; you will certainly be &s;u&s;pected of conforming to their vices, at lea&s;t,
<PB N="30" REF="046207_0030_1020F8CFC2615060">
while you are in their company, and cannot hope to e&s;cape the notice of tho&s;e, who&s;e good opinion you would wi&s;h to gain, or pre&s;erve. And every man who has a ju&s;t regard for his reputation, though he &s;hould be influenced by no higher principle, will cautiou&s;ly &s;hun the company of men of ill characters, le&s;t his own &s;hould fall under &s;u&s;picion.</P>
<P>A good name is &s;o &s;atisfactory in it&s;elf, and at|tended with &s;o many advantages, that he who is carele&s;s about it, mu&s;t be equally de&s;titute of an ingenuous &s;pirit, and a regard to his pre&s;ent good. More than this, he is in&s;en&s;ible to the mo&s;t powerful incitement to a ju&s;t and laudable conduct, next to religion it&s;elf. And indeed, to be indifferent about the opinion of the world, e&s;pecially of the worthy and virtuous part of it, is to be in the highway to di&s;honor, vice and ruin. Take away the re&s;traints which ari&s;e from a regard to commendation and e&s;teem, and there is nothing left, but the fear of puni&s;hment, by which human depravity can be deterred from the gro&s;&s;e&s;t enormities.</P>
<P>Be careful then, to pre&s;erve at all times, a re|&s;pect to the good opinion of others, next to a reverence for your con&s;ciences and the authority of God. Never hazard your characters, for any gra|tification you can find in the company and friend&s;hip of di&s;&s;ipated per&s;ons; whatever figure they may make in the world; or by whatever arts or elegance their vices may be garni&s;hed.</P>
<P>You will illy forfeit the e&s;teem of the worthy and virtuous, for the fla&s;hy and dangerous entertain|ments of di&s;&s;olute company. And let me particu|larly remind you, that with all the other evils to which bad connexions will expo&s;e you, by the lo&s;s of your characters, they will be a bar in the way of your advancing hereafter to di&s;tinction and
<PB N="31" REF="046207_0031_1020F88C8AD8E2D0">
importance in &s;ociety. If your fir&s;t connexions are with idle and vicious per&s;ons, though you &s;hould be happy enough to &s;ee your error, and for&s;ake them, you will not ea&s;ily gain the confidence of tho&s;e who know your former way of life, and with whom it was &s;pent. It will ju&s;tly be concluded, that you will require time to correct the bad prin|ciples and habits you contracted from your company. Every one will be &s;hy and backward to tru&s;t you, in any thing of importance, till you have given &s;atisfactory proofs that you are fixed in new habits, and in reputable and virtuous &s;ociety.</P>
<P>It has frequently happened, that a young man by the error of a&s;&s;ociating with di&s;reputable company, at his fir&s;t appearance in the world, has lo&s;t the mo&s;t favorable pro&s;pects of bu&s;ine&s;s, intere&s;t and promotion, which he has never, by any exertion, been able to recover.</P>
<P>And certainly, the highe&s;t plea&s;ures that can be enjoyed in di&s;&s;olute company, are dearly purcha&s;ed, at the expence of honor and e&s;teem, influence and u&s;efulne&s;s.</P>
<P>I &s;hall conclude this addre&s;s with the following directions on the &s;ubject before us.</P>
<P N="1">1. In forming intimacies and friend&s;hips, be always cautious and &s;low.</P>
<P>Ha&s;tine&s;s is a common error of youth; e&s;pecially where the entertainments of &s;ociety are concerned. Unacquainted with mankind, it is apt to be taken with the fir&s;t appearances and profe&s;&s;ions of good-will; without any apprehen&s;ions that they are generally nothing more than cu&s;tomary forms of civility and politne&s;s; and often the covering of a di&s;ingenuous, and de&s;igning temper. By this mi&s;take, it eagerly runs into connexions, which it mu&s;t either break off, with di&s;appointment and &s;hame; or
<PB N="32" REF="046207_0032_1020F8D150F63960">
endanger every thing important to its happine&s;s. And to expo&s;e one&s;elf to the former, without any pro&s;pect of &s;olid advantage, mu&s;t be the height of folly; and to the latter, little le&s;s than madne&s;s.</P>
<P>You cannot, then, be too cautious, in &s;o intere&s;|ting a ca&s;e. Inform your&s;elves, as particularly as may be, of the principles, habits and characters, of tho&s;e with whom you may be induced, to form an intimacy or friend&s;hip. And le&s;t you &s;hould be deceived and mi&s;led, by tru&s;ting to your own judge|ment and prudence, be careful to advi&s;e with tho&s;e, on who&s;e friend&s;hip and knowledge you can depend. E&s;pecially, if you have parents, or guardians, make them your fir&s;t coun&s;ellors. This you are bound to do, not only out of re&s;pect to them; but, for &s;ake of your own &s;afety. They are not only better judges of mankind, than you can be &s;uppo&s;ed to be, but, it may ju&s;tly be concluded, that they have too great a regard to your happine&s;s, either to debar you of any rea&s;onable enjoyment; or not to warn you of apparent danger.</P>
<P>By &s;uch a precaution, you may &s;ave your honor, your virtue, and your peace of mind. By ra&s;hly following the impul&s;es of your own inclination, you may lo&s;e them all.</P>
<P>Should you be ruined by confidence in your own prudence and virtue, you will forever lie under the reproach of being your own de&s;troyer.</P>
<P>Should you be deceived, after all the precautions you can make u&s;e of, you will e&s;cape the greate&s;t of mi&s;eries, that of being obliged to accu&s;e your&s;elves, as the authors of your unhappine&s;s.</P>
<P N="2">2. Should you form connexions dangerous to your virtue and happine&s;s, I advi&s;e you immediately to di&s;engage your&s;elves. I have already touched on the difficulties of &s;uch a ta&s;k, and you will cer|tainly
<PB N="33" REF="046207_0033_1020F88E15E38018">
find it as hard, on experiment, as I have re|pre&s;ented, if not much more &s;o. This I mention, not to di&s;courage you, but to prepare you to act with the more firmne&s;s and deci&s;ion, when you come to the trial.</P>
<P>To warn you is to arm you. Whatever ob&s;tacles may be in the way, from your own inclinations, or the enticements of your companions, from the entertainment and plea&s;ure they have afforded you, from any re&s;pect you may &s;uppo&s;e your&s;elves to owe them, from the &s;en&s;e of any favours they have done you, or their power of further &s;erving you, whatever figure they may make, or however long they may have been your a&s;&s;ociates, you are without delay, to make your e&s;cape. And I urge you to this, the more warmly; becau&s;e you may &s;uppo&s;e it nece&s;&s;ary, for &s;ake of decency, and &s;aving appearnces, to do it &s;o gradually, as to conceal your de&s;ign, and &s;o avoid giving offence, and incur+ring unnece&s;&s;ary reproach.</P>
<P>Could you fully depend on your re&s;olution, this might be well enough. But, with mo&s;t, the expe|riment would be hazardous, if not entirely fail.</P>
<P>If after you apprehend your danger, you &s;hould allow your&s;elves to meet them, at one time, and another, on the &s;ame terms of freedom and inti|macy, you will be in danger of lo&s;ing by degrees, your fir&s;t re&s;olution, till you are again entangled.</P>
<P>Follow then the fir&s;t dictates of con&s;ciences and duty. To parly with temptation, when you per|ceive it, is deliberately to expo&s;e your&s;elves to guilt, and mi&s;ery, which will be &s;o much the greater as you have run into it; with your eyes open.</P>
<P>Fear no &s;light, ridicule, or reproach, you may be likely to &s;uffer, by &s;o nece&s;&s;ary a re&s;olution. The e&s;teem of good men, the approbation of your own
<PB N="34" REF="046207_0034_1020F8D5046C33C0">
con&s;ciences, and the favor of God, will infinitely outweigh all the inconveniencies it can po&s;&s;ibly &s;ubject <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> you to. Finally, in your common inter|cour&s;e with others, and in your particular intimacies and friend&s;hips, make it your &s;teady aim and concern, to improve in the knowledge of mankind, and in tho&s;e generous and benevolent affections which are nece&s;&s;ary for your acting your parts well in &s;ociety here, that you may be prepared for the &s;ociety of the ble&s;&s;ed hereafter.</P>
<P>This undoubtedly was the ultimate de&s;ign of God, in enduing us with the &s;ocial affections, and this is their highe&s;t excellence. Should you therefore, be mi&s;&s;ed by them, into error and vice, you will not only defeat, as I may &s;ay, this wi&s;e and gracious de&s;ign of your creator; but the great purpo&s;e of the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, which is, "to redeem you from the vain conver&s;ation of the wicked," and form you for an everla&s;ting union with him&s;elf, and his redeemed family.</P>
<P>In a virtuous commerce and friend&s;hip with others, on the amiable and divine principles by which all his followers are to be governed, you will not only enjoy the highe&s;t plea&s;ures that this imper|fect &s;tate can afford; but you will be advanced at la&s;t, "to an innumerable company of angels, to the general a&s;&s;embly and church of the fir&s;t born, which are written in heaven, and to God the judge of all, and to the &s;pirits of ju&s;t men made per|fect, and to Je&s;us the mediator of the new covenant," where friend&s;hip and love &s;hall be ripened into perfection. If on the contrary, you &s;hould be &s;o lo&s;t to a ju&s;t &s;en&s;e of your duty and happine&s;s, as to form your principal connexions, with vicious and ungodly men, you mu&s;t expect to be joined to them at la&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="046207_0035_1020F89170DC8798">Then all the kind and plea&s;urable affections of your nature, will be turned into hatred and malice; and they who have been a&s;&s;ociates in &s;in here, will mutually reproach and torment each other, in everla&s;ting mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>It is an e&s;tabli&s;hed law of the go&s;pel, that "neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effe|minate, nor abu&s;ers of them&s;elves with mankind, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, &s;hall inherit the kingdom of God." &mdash;And if they can make no part of that &s;ociety, they are certainly unfit to be the a&s;&s;ociates of tho&s;e who would wi&s;h and hope to be joined to it.</P>
<P>You &s;ee then, my dear youth, that every thing important to you depends on the company you keep; your own honor and that of your neare&s;t friends and relations, your virtue, your u&s;efulne&s;s, your peace of mind, and your eternal happine&s;s, are concerned.</P>
<P>By all the&s;e then, and by the love of God, and his &s;on Je&s;us Chri&s;t who died to &s;ave you, I affec|tionately pray you, &s;hun the &s;ociety of wicked men, and form only &s;uch intimacies as are founded on virtue and piety, that each of you may be able to &s;ay, "I am a companion of all them that fear God and keep his precepts."</P>
<P>The remaining &s;ubjects within my plan will be con&s;idered in my next di&s;cour&s;e. In the mean time, con&s;ider &s;eriou&s;ly, and faithfully, what has been &s;aid in this; and you will be prepared to hear me again, I flatter my&s;elf, with la&s;ting advantage.</P>

<P>IF my former di&s;cour&s;e made any impre&s;&s;ion on your minds, &s;uitable to the importance of the &s;ubjects it treated of; I &s;hall the more certainly obtain your &s;erious attention to this.</P>
<P>The advantages of early religion, of an early application to u&s;eful employment, and the nece&s;&s;ity of a prudent choice of company, have been already con&s;idered and recommended to your &s;erious regard.</P>
<P>The &s;ubjects of this addre&s;s are, the government of the temper and pa&s;&s;ions, the evils of an exce&s;&s;ive attachment to plea&s;ure, and the great rule by which your hearts and lives are to be governed.</P>
<P>Each of the&s;e articles might well employ a &s;epa|rate di&s;cour&s;e, but the limits which I have a&s;&s;igned my&s;elf, oblige me to di&s;patch the whole of them in this. I &s;hall therefore attempt, under each, to col|lect the mo&s;t important particulars, and enforce them upon you, by &s;uitable arguments.</P>
<P>Of the pa&s;&s;ions or affections in general, it is proper to remark to you, that, &s;o far as they are original parts of the human con&s;titution, and in any degree lawful, as the principles or &s;prings of all our actions and under the government of rea&s;on and religion, they are highly conducive to our own good, and that of others. On the contrary&punc; all
<PB N="38" REF="046207_0037_1020F8D8D68DF4D0">
that are the con&s;equences of the di&s;order and depra|vity of our nature, and &s;o in every degree unlawful; or tho&s;e that, though lawful in them&s;elves, are in|dulged beyond their ju&s;t and natural bounds, become highly injurious; either to our&s;elves only, or to others and our&s;eves, at the &s;ame time. It is the latter &s;ort, I mean now to con&s;ider. Of the&s;e I intend pride, envy, ambition, anger, malice and revenge. The&s;e are all founded in immoderate &s;elf-love; and, except the fir&s;t, are directly of a male|volent and vicious nature.</P>
<P N="1">1. As to pride&mdash;without con&s;idering whether it be &s;trictly ranked among the pa&s;&s;ions, or not, I ob&s;erve, that it is not only as unrea&s;onable, as the wor&s;t of them, being in all re&s;pects, mo&s;t unbe|coming a fallen and mi&s;erable creature, but is pro|ductive of pernicious effects, both on the individual who is the &s;ubject of it, and on others.</P>
<P>It is unju&s;t in it&s;elf, as all the advantages of fortune, body, and mind, which one man can po&s;&s;e&s;s above another, are to be a&s;cribed to the bounty of God, independent of any merit in him&s;elf, as the procuring cau&s;e of them. "For who maketh thee to differ; and what ha&s;t thou, that thou did&s;t not receive? Now if thou did&s;t receive it, why do&s;t thou glory, as if thou had&s;t not received it?"</P>
<P>It is injurious to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, as it renders him always unea&s;y, le&s;t he &s;hould not be treated, ac|cording to his importance in his own eyes, makes him &s;u&s;picious of offences, where none have been of|fered, impatient of controul, re&s;entful, liable to &s;tudied &s;lights and in&s;ults from others, and e&s;pecially, offen&s;ive to God, "before whom, every one that is proud in heart is an abomination." As to its effects on others, be&s;ides indifference, haughtine&s;s and contempt, which to mo&s;t men are unplea&s;ant
<PB N="39" REF="046207_0038_1020F898938D6AB8">
and provoking, it often prompts to cruelty, inju&s;|tice and revenge, which the proud &s;uppo&s;e them|&s;elves entitled to practi&s;e, in con&s;ideration of their &s;uperior importance</P>
<P>In all re&s;pects, it is a mean and contemptible pa&s;&s;ion; a &s;ure indication of want of knowledge, and &s;olid worth, and which as certainly as any other vice, is one way or another, puni&s;hed even in this world.</P>
<P>Humility, on the contrary, is ever &s;ure of being re&s;pected, and always gains the mo&s;t, where it claims the lea&s;t. And what is infinitely more va|luable than all, the honor and re&s;pect it can gain from man; it is ever of the highe&s;t e&s;timation in the &s;ight of God. For thus &s;aith the high and lofty one that inhabiteth eternity, who&s;e name is holy; I dwell in the high and holy place; with him al&s;o that is of an humble and contrite &s;pirit; to revive the &s;pirit of the humble, and to revive the &s;pirit of the contrite ones." "It is therefore, better to be of an humble &s;pirit with the lowly, than to divide the &s;poil with the great."</P>
<P N="2">2. Envy.&mdash;It has been &s;aid that this is the fir&s;t of the injurious pa&s;&s;ions that operates in the mind. Whatever be the order in which it makes its ap|pearance, it is in every degree criminal, and mo&s;t oppo&s;ite to all the principles of benevolence, and the con&s;titution of the go&s;pel.</P>
<P>The object of envy is always the good and hap|pine&s;s of others, whether it be their ea&s;e, wealth, reputation, influence, or any other circum&s;tance of enjoyment&mdash;And it has this peculiar malignancy in its nature, to wi&s;h to le&s;&s;en that happine&s;s, though it &s;hould not, by that means, make any addition to its own. It even &s;eems to be unea&s;y that there &s;hould be any happine&s;s in the world, but that
<PB N="40" REF="046207_0039_1020F89A1F171B40">
which falls to it&s;elf, &s;ince they who are under its influence, are di&s;&s;atisfied with their &s;uperiors, for being in better, circum&s;tances, with their equals, for being as happy as them&s;elves, and with their inferiors, for &s;eeming contented and happy in their condition, and e&s;pecially, if in the way of improv|ing it to an equality with their own. The con&s;e|quence of &s;o malevolent a temper is, that wherever they look, they di&s;cover objects to offend and di&s;quiet them. They are therefore, habitually fretful, gloomy and di&s;contented; and &s;o incapable of en|joying what they po&s;&s;e&s;s, however &s;ufficient for their happine&s;s. Their &s;ecret di&s;quietude and angui&s;h, like a &s;low poi&s;on on the vitals, preys upon their &s;pirits, and gradually con&s;umes the powers of enjoyment, till their life becomes in&s;ipid and bur|den &s;ome.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">There have been in&s;tances of per&s;ons being &s;o affected by this pa&s;&s;ion, as to fall into lingering and incurable di&s;ea&s;e.</NOTE> Solomon has therefore forcibly de&s;cribed it, in this view, as "the rottene&s;s of the bones." And while it thus affects the envious them&s;elves, it prompts to &s;ubtle and malicious methods of ob|&s;tructing the happine&s;s and pro&s;perity of tho&s;e who are envied, to unprovoked re&s;entments, defamation, inju&s;tice, and other injuries, equally di&s;honorable and criminal.</P>
<P>There is nothing indeed within the bounds of human malevolence which this vicious pa&s;&s;ion cannot perpetrate, when it has got full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the heart. And therefore, the wi&s;e man ob&s;erves&mdash; "Wrath is cruel, and anger is outrageous, but who is able to &s;tand before envy." Through envy Cain killed his brother Abel, "becau&s;e his own works were evil, and his brother's righteous."

And to name no other in&s;tance, becau&s;e none greater can be named, moved with envy, at the miracles, authority and reputa|tion of Chri&s;t, the rulers of the Jews per&s;ecuted him with unrelenting malice; and at la&s;t, delivered him to the Romans, to be put to death. So great an evil is envy, and &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to be excluded from the brea&s;ts of all who would wi&s;h to pre&s;erve the peace of their own minds, and be clear of the guilt of de&s;troying that of others!</P>
<P>In order to this, con&s;ider, that as far as &s;ome may be &s;uperior to you in any of the means of happi|ne&s;s, you may be &s;uperior to others, and that the &s;ame righteous providence which hath given you the particular advantages you enjoy, hath given to others, tho&s;e which place them above you. There is therefore, no more rea&s;on why you &s;hould be di&s;&s;atisfied with others, for their enjoyments, what|ever they be, than that others &s;hould be di&s;&s;atisfied with you, for yours.</P>
<P>Con&s;ider al&s;o, that to envy others the happine&s;s that God hath given them, is to find fault with the di&s;tribution he hath made of his favors, which is highly criminal in his &s;ight, "who giveth no ac|count of any of his matters."</P>
<P>Endeavor to be contented with your lot, what|ever di&s;advantages may attend it. There is nothing will make you ea&s;ier, in the mo&s;t unfavorable cir|cum&s;tances, &s;o effectually prevent all the motions
<PB N="42" REF="046207_0041_1020F8DB5E938F78">
of envy, and its attendant di&s;quietudes, as this. Should you have no more than the mere &s;upports of life, remember that the be&s;t of men have &s;ome|times been de&s;titute even of the&s;e&mdash;"both naked and without any certain dwelling place."</P>
<P>Con&s;ider how certainly an envious temper will render you incapable of enjoying the advantages that are in your po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; and di&s;qualify you for tho&s;e habits of benevolence which are nece&s;&s;ary for you, both as men and chri&s;tians, and for that &s;tate of happine&s;s hereafter, from which envy and competition will be utterly excluded. Cultivate a vigorous good will to all men, and in&s;tead of re|pining at their happine&s;s, you will make it an occa|&s;ion of increa&s;ing your own. With &s;uch a temper, if others weep, you will weep with them, and your &s;ympathy will be repaid with &s;ub&s;tantial plea|&s;ure&mdash;If others rejoice, you will rejoice with them, and &s;o your enjoyment will be doubled.</P>
<P N="3">3. Ambition is al&s;o a turbulent and dangerous pa&s;&s;ion, again&s;t which it will be nece&s;&s;ary for you to be much on your guard.</P>
<P>This is &s;ometimes called emulation; which in a qualified &s;en&s;e, is an argument of a generous &s;pirit&punc; and under proper regulations, highly u&s;eful both to individuals and &s;ociety.</P>
<P>It gives animation and vigour both to the body and mind; and often produceth excellence in knowledge, art, and enterprize, which without it, would never have appeared. It is however too commonly accompanied with envy, by which it is at lea&s;t, hurtful to tho&s;e who po&s;&s;e&s;s it. Ambition in its cu&s;tomary acceptation, is generally attended with malevolence, in a le&s;s or greater degree, accord|ing to the objects to which it a&s;pires. When it aims at di&s;tinction in wealth and figure, in fame of valor and
<PB N="43" REF="046207_0042_1020F89F6E9C3488">
conque&s;t, in authority and dominion; and e&s;pecially when it is inten&s;e and violent, it occa&s;ions more di&s;order in the mind, and greater evils to &s;ociety, than any other pa&s;&s;ion. There is nothing, how|ever mean and criminal in it&s;elf, or injurious to others, that it does not employ in its &s;ervice. Di&s;|&s;imulation, flattery and fal&s;hood, bribery, inju&s;|tice, and cruelty, faction and tumult, blood&s;hed and de&s;olation, are often made &s;ub&s;ervient to its purpo&s;es. Nor are the ties of friend&s;hip or even of nature &s;trong enough to re&s;train it, when it is nece&s;&s;ary to its views, that they &s;hould be broken.</P>
<P>Indeed, the greate&s;t part of the hi&s;tory of the world is made up of horrid details of war, cruelty and ma&s;&s;acre, produced by the phrenzy and mad|ne&s;s of ambition.</P>
<P>But, happy for mankind, there are few in cir|cum&s;tances to admit of pro&s;pects &s;ufficient to excite it to that ferocity, which equally de&s;troys, without he&s;itation or remor&s;e, the rights and peace of in|dividuals, and nations.</P>
<P>In the bulk of men, it aims at nothing more than to gain &s;ome trifling advantage in name or appearance, above tho&s;e who are in the &s;ame way, or condition of life, or to make a &s;how of dignity and importance, above their real merit and cir|cum&s;tances.</P>
<P>The following are the more common in&s;tances of it; and therefore, mo&s;t de&s;erving of our atten|tion. It prompts &s;ome to make a figure in dre&s;s, equipage and manner of living, which they have not ability to &s;upport. By this unrea&s;onable vanity, they often exhau&s;t, in a little time, the fund they &s;et out upon; and which with more moderate views, might have &s;upported them with comfort, decency and credit. The con&s;equence of which is, that
<PB N="44" REF="046207_0043_1020F8DCE7F36EA8">
they are obliged to fall back, with mortification and di&s;honor, into circum&s;tances which they before de&s;pi&s;ed; and there perhaps, to continue. And it often happens, that they who have innocently contributed to its gratification, are involved in the ruin that follows it.&mdash;The hireling and mecha|nic are defrauded of the reward of their labors, the merchant of the value of his goods, and per|haps the orphan of his portion and dependance.</P>
<P>It puts others upon wild and extravagant pro|jects, which, if practicable at all, co&s;t more in the execution, than they are afterwards worth; yet, when &s;uch men have &s;et out in a favorite en|terprize, they will continue in their error, to the detriment, if not ruin of their e&s;tates and families; rather than be thought de&s;titute of &s;pirit and per|&s;everance; or weak enough to attempt that, which they could not effect.</P>
<P>By the &s;ame vanity, others engage in employ|ments, and &s;et up for offices, for which they have no competent qualifications&mdash;And the con&s;equence is, that if they do not bring upon them&s;elves con|tempt; they are at lea&s;t, not entitled to re&s;pect&mdash; whereas, with a ju&s;t e&s;timate of their talents and merit, in other occupations, or departments, they might not only have benefited &s;ociety, but perhaps have acquired di&s;tingui&s;hed reputation.</P>
<P>In the&s;e in&s;tances, if ambition be not attended with envy and ill will of others; it at lea&s;t perverts the rea&s;on, and de&s;troys the peace and enjoyment of the ambitious, and interrupts that order which is nece&s;&s;ary for the good of &s;ociety.</P>
<P>To guard again&s;t this di&s;quieting and injurious pa&s;&s;ion, con&s;ider, how little figure and di&s;tinction in the eyes of the world, will avail to real happi|ne&s;s, while your minds are in a &s;tate incapable of
<PB N="45" REF="046207_0044_1020F8A2F9974940">
enjoying it. If you had all the notice and re&s;pect that were ever gained by wealth, power, and office, it would be impo&s;&s;ible for you to be happy, while you are &s;o di&s;contented in your pre&s;ent &s;ituation, as to be continually aiming at new honors, and pre-emi|nence. It is the nature of ambition to grow more re&s;tle&s;s and importunate, by every new attainment. Succe&s;s in its pur&s;uits is but new fuel thrown into the flame that is already too &s;trong, and which mu&s;t at length, con&s;ume the brea&s;t where it is kin|dled. If it were even po&s;&s;ible for the objects of ambition to afford their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors all that they wi&s;h for, yet, how &s;oon mu&s;t they vani&s;h away, and be no more to them, than they were to others a thou&s;and years before!</P>
<P>Affliction will render you in&s;en&s;ible to their im|pre&s;&s;ion; and death will de&s;troy the remembrance of them forever.</P>
<P>Di&s;tinction is at an end in the grave. "The honorable man and the coun&s;ellor, and the cun|ning artificer, and the eloquent orator," lie on the &s;ame level with tho&s;e who died unhonored and unnoticed.</P>
<P>Moderate your fondne&s;s for every thing that has no other good, but that which depends on opinion and caprice. "The world pa&s;&s;eth away; and the lu&s;t thereof; but he that doth the will of God abideth forever."</P>
<P>In the &s;ame degree as you aim at the things of another world, you will be cured of a pa&s;&s;ionate fondne&s;s for the imaginary advantages of the pre|&s;ent. Endeavor to excel in virtue, in which there can be neither injury, nor exce&s;s; and in which, to be &s;uperior to others, is only to be more honor|able in the &s;ight of God, and more happy in your&s;elves.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="046207_0045_1020F8DFF5174F00">This is di&s;tinction worthy of a rational and immortal being; and will give you, in the mo&s;t ob&s;cure condition of life, a plea&s;ure infinitely more &s;olid and permanent, than any you can derive from the exterior advantages of the world; though you po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them in the highe&s;t degree, that human vanity has ever a&s;pired to.</P>
<P N="4">4. Anger or re&s;entment.</P>
<P>Under proper re&s;traints, this is not only lawful; but u&s;eful and nece&s;&s;ary. It is, however a matter, of no &s;mall difficulty to moderate it, &s;o as not to go beyond the bounds of its natural and intended u&s;e.</P>
<P>Apt to be excited on &s;udden, and unexpected occa&s;ions, it is le&s;s &s;ubject to the controul of rea&s;on, and &s;ooner runs to exce&s;s, than mo&s;t of the other pa&s;&s;ions. It is for this rea&s;on, that even in per&s;ons of an habitual good temper, it often ri&s;es to great exce&s;s, before there is time to con&s;ider its tendency, and call in the aids of rea&s;on or religion, to coun|teract it.</P>
<P>On the body, when exce&s;&s;ive, &s;ome of its effects are, hurry and agitation of the &s;pirits, trembling, weakne&s;s; and in &s;ome con&s;titutions pain, apoplexy, and &s;udden death. On the mind, confu&s;ion of thought and rea&s;on, &s;ometimes di&s;traction, and always violent determinations. In con&s;equence of the&s;e, abu&s;ive language, and other injuries far above the provocation which excited them. There is nothing indeed, which in the&s;e circum&s;tances, it cannot perpetrate. The innocent as well as the guilty, friend as well as foe, are at the&s;e times, equally expo&s;ed to its fury. Even life it&s;elf has often been &s;acrificed to its impetuo&s;ity, in violation of the tendere&s;t ties of friend&s;hip, and natural rela|tion; friend has ha&s;tily murdered friend, and bro|ther de&s;troyed brother. Thus "Wrath is cruel,
<PB N="47" REF="046207_0046_1020F8A4900A00B8">
and anger outrageous," and "re&s;teth in the bo|&s;om of fools."</P>
<P>To indulge it, after there is time for recollec|tion, and re&s;i&s;tance, is as great a mark of folly and weakne&s;s, as it is criminal and hurtful. A wi&s;e man will endeavor to moderate it, where there is a ju&s;t rea&s;on for expre&s;&s;ing it, to &s;uppre&s;s the fir&s;t motions of it, where there is danger of its ri&s;ing to exce&s;s, or entirely to prevent it, by avoiding, if po&s;&s;ible, tho&s;e occa&s;ions that would be apt to excite it.</P>
<P>There are few indeed, &s;o happy in the govern|ment of them&s;elves, as to be able to do any of the&s;e as duty or prudence would point out&mdash;But, it is certainly incumbent on every one, for &s;ake of his own peace of mind, and that of others, re&s;olutely to attempt them; and there are few of &s;o irritable and re&s;entful a temper, who might not, by habitual care and vigilance, acquire the a&s;cendancy over it.</P>
<P>For this purpo&s;e, con&s;ider where it may be proper to indulge your anger at all, and if proper, to what degree. Con&s;ider how liable you are to mi&s;take the nature of offences, and to over-rate the degree of their guilt; and al&s;o, in how many in&s;tances, for faults of your own, you may &s;tand in need of the patience and good nature of others; and e&s;pecially, of the forbearance of God, "be|fore whom, if he &s;hould mark iniquity, who &s;hall &s;tand?" This latter con&s;ideration, if duly attended to, will produce the happie&s;t effects.</P>
<P>Under an habitual &s;en&s;e of your daily offences again&s;t God, you will think le&s;s of tho&s;e committed again&s;t your&s;elves, and be more ready to treat them with lenity.</P>
<P>It will be often prudent and nece&s;&s;ary for you, entirely to overlook the faults of tho&s;e who are
<PB N="48" REF="046207_0047_1020F8E2988465D0">
under your management and authority. This will &s;ave you a great deal of u&s;ele&s;s vexation, and your re&s;entment, when it mu&s;t be expre&s;&s;ed, will have the better effect. By finding fault with every thing you &s;ee ami&s;s, and &s;uffering it to put you out of tem|per, you will acquire an habit of fretfulne&s;s and anger, that will keep you con&s;tantly four and unhappy.</P>
<P>When your anger has by any cau&s;e been excited, endeavor, as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, to recover your &s;e|renity. Though the greate&s;t danger is generally, from the fir&s;t tran&s;ports of this pa&s;&s;ion; yet, when it is cheri&s;hed, for any length of time, after the occa&s;ion which produced it, there is great danger of its rankling into malice and revenge. And it is worthy of your notice, that this is more apt to be its effect, in tho&s;e who are &s;low and phlegmatic in their temper, than in the quick and fiery.</P>
<P>The latter are to be dreaded, only in the mo|ment of their rage, the others mo&s;t, after you would &s;uppo&s;e them to have cooled, and forgiven the provocation.</P>
<P>It is an excellent precept of the apo&s;tle, "Let not the &s;un go down upon thy wrath." The force of which might probably depend on this con&s;i|deration, that during the night, the mind being unemployed by tho&s;e objects which entertain it, through the day, is more apt to dwell upon, and to magnify real or &s;uppo&s;ed injuries; and to medi|tate mea&s;ures of revenge. Or it might have re|ference to the time of the evening &s;acrifice, which was about &s;un&s;et; and which required that all animo&s;ities and differences &s;hould be &s;ettled, before the &s;olemnity could be properly attended. "If thou bringe&s;t thy gift to the altar, and there re|membere&s;t that thy brother hath ought again&s;t thee;
<PB N="49" REF="046207_0048_1020F8A7A1E5B818">
leave there thy gift before the altar; and go thy way, fir&s;t be reconciled to thy brother; and then come and offer thy gift." This is certainly the &s;tronge&s;t po&s;&s;ible argument again&s;t continued anger and animo&s;ities, becau&s;e it implies, that while our minds are di&s;compo&s;ed and fretted with re&s;ent|ment, our religious offerings will not be accepted. Be&s;ides, he who lies down with anger and ill will, has not only been unfit for the devotions of the evening; but will mo&s;t probably ri&s;e with the &s;ame temper, and be unfit for tho&s;e of the morning al&s;o, a ca&s;e certainly, of equal guilt and danger to the &s;oul.</P>
<P>In the management of this pa&s;&s;ion, it will greatly a&s;&s;i&s;t you to con&s;ider often the evils that attend it, the di&s;quietude, fury and ra&s;hne&s;s it occa&s;ions, the &s;hame it will often put you to, and the repentance and &s;elf reproach, you mu&s;t exerci&s;e, if you would hope to be pardoned even by men. Make it a part of your daily devotions, to pray for a &s;uitable temper towards others, under all provocations and offences. This will bring you into an habit of watching over your hearts; till you will acquire by degrees, at lea&s;t, &s;o far, the government of this impetuous pa&s;&s;ion, as not to de&s;troy your own peace, or be injurious to others.</P>
<P>And I particularly urge you, to endeavor to &s;ub|due it, now while you are young; and your minds le&s;s liable to be ruffled and vexed, than they will probably be hereafter. Increa&s;ing cares, di&s;appoint|ments and infirmities, may render you more &s;u&s;|picious of injuries, and induce an habit of fretfulne&s;s and intemperate re&s;entments, that will make you not only contemptible, but wretched. "He that is &s;low to anger, is better than the mighty; and he that ruleth his &s;pirit, than he that taketh a city." We come now to con&s;ider.</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="50" REF="046207_0049_1020F8E54EA74438">5. Malice and revenge.</P>
<P>I have put the&s;e together, becau&s;e the one almo&s;t unavoidably runs into the other.</P>
<P>Malice is properly continued anger, accompanied with hatred and ill will. It is a black and malig|nant pa&s;&s;ion, which will allow no merit, or good qualities, to tho&s;e who are its objects. It di&s;po&s;es to mi&s;repre&s;ent their be&s;t intentions, words and actions, and will make no allowance for their failings, however innocent and pardonable.</P>
<P>It prevents tho&s;e good wi&s;hes and &s;ervices, which all men owe to one another, and without which, the bonds of &s;ociety mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be di&s;&s;olved. And what is &s;till wor&s;e, it prompts to violent per|&s;onal injuries; and takes plea&s;ure to inflict them, however di&s;tre&s;&s;ing to tho&s;e who &s;uffer them. When this is done, by way of &s;atisfaction for injuries, real or &s;uppo&s;ed, it is properly revenge&mdash;And when I name this, I name almo&s;t the highe&s;t effort of a depraved and abandoned heart. It is the more vile and criminal, as it is deliberate, &s;ubtle, and determined in its mea&s;ures, and therefore cannot plead, ha&s;tine&s;s of impul&s;e, which may often be allowed as an apology for the violence of anger.</P>
<P>There is nothing indeed, too black for &s;uch a temper; and no caution or vigilance can &s;ecure tho&s;e who are its objects, from falling a prey to it.</P>
<P>From this view of the&s;e wor&s;t of pa&s;&s;ions, you will at once &s;ee the nece&s;&s;ity of preventing them, if po&s;&s;ible, from ever obtaining a place in your brea&s;ts. They are in them&s;elves &s;o deformed, and &s;o effec|tually de&s;troy tho&s;e benevolent affections which form the dignity of the &s;oul; and render it &s;o unlike the &s;tandard of love and goodne&s;s, that you cannot treat them with &s;ufficient abhorrence.</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="046207_0050_1020F90D27C58C90">There is no injury you can receive, by whatever circum&s;tances it may be aggravated, &s;ufficient to ju&s;tity you in repaying the authors of it, with malice and revenge.</P>
<P>Where it is your duty to obtain redre&s;s of any wrongs you may have &s;u&s;tained, in your property, per&s;on, or reputation; pur&s;ue your mea&s;ures with calmne&s;s and moderation of temper; free from that &s;pirit of revenge which, in &s;uch ca&s;es, too com|monly prevails, even where men act agreeably to the order which the public authority has pre&s;cribed. To pro&s;ecute tho&s;e who have injured you, with a view to gratify your re&s;entment, is as incon&s;i&s;tent with true benevolence, as it is contrary to the expre&s;s &s;tatutes of the go&s;pel. And yet, how common is it, for evil minded men, to put one another to unnece&s;&s;ary co&s;t and trouble, at law, chiefly with a view to gratify a &s;plenetic and re|vengeful temper, while they ju&s;tify them&s;elves, and &s;tifle the reproaches of con&s;cience, by the pretext of acting according to the pre&s;cribed forms of the community they belong to? Thus "they flatter them&s;elves in their own eyes, 'till their iniquity be found to be hateful." And &s;o it will be at la&s;t, with this and every other vicious principle, however di&s;gui&s;ed, for the pre&s;ent, by plau&s;ible appearances.</P>
<P>Let me particularly caution you, again&s;t that fal&s;e &s;en&s;e of honor, which is &s;o fa&s;hionable in the world; and which, under a fair name, perpetrates the wor&s;t of crimes, that a malicious and revenge|ful &s;pirit can occa&s;ion. This is &s;o far from that true honor which originates in genero&s;ity and great|ne&s;s of mind; that it is nothing but violent &s;elf-love and pride, producing impatience of the &s;lighte&s;t injuries, and affronts, and prompting to furious re&s;entment, that can often be &s;atisfied with nothing le&s;s than the life of the offender.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="046207_0051_1020F8E8125D2FE8">It is entirely in this that the practice of duelling is founded, than which, there is nothing more mean, criminal and cruel, that has ever been per|mitted in civilized and chri&s;tian &s;ocieties; and nothing more de&s;erving of being bani&s;hed from all good governments, by the heavie&s;t penalties.</P>
<P>Let me be&s;eech you, never to think it nece&s;&s;ary for your honor, as it certainly never can be, to &s;acrifice to it, either your own life, or that of another, in this fa&s;hionable, but mo&s;t guilty way of murder. Should you fall in &s;uch a conflict, you would fall without hope&mdash;Or &s;hould you de&s;troy your adver&s;ary, you would bring upon your &s;ouls, the guilt of di&s;patching him, as a victim to your pride and re&s;entment, with all his &s;ins upon him, into the eternal world. And unle&s;s you &s;hould &s;uffer the angui&s;h of repentance, proportioned to &s;o enormous a crime; and his blood be wa&s;hed from your con&s;cience, by that of the great atonement; you mu&s;t bear it on your &s;oul to the bar of God, where you would meet the revengeful &s;pirit of your adver&s;ary, to accu&s;e you; and &s;uffer with it, the judgement "of him, to whom vengeance belong|eth." Cultivate that true honor which is founded in virtue and religion; and it will put you far above the meanne&s;s and cruelty, of revenging your|&s;elves, at the expence of all that can be dear to your fellow creatures.</P>
<P>Finally con&s;ider, that while a malicious and re|vengeful temper will de&s;troy the peace of your own minds, and render you the mo&s;t dangerous members of &s;ociety; it will entirely unfit you for the &s;ervices of religion, and the enjoyment of God.</P>

<P>On the whole, as to the government of your temper and pa&s;&s;ions, in general, con&s;ider, that, in the &s;ame degree as, under the direction of rea&s;on and con&s;cience, they will greatly conduce to your happine&s;s; while they are moved by the impul&s;e of pre&s;ent objects, without regard to the ends they were intended to an&s;wer, in your con&s;titution, they will be the occa&s;ions of innumerable errors and di&s;quietudes, to your un&s;peakable mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>Habits of good nature, moderation and patience, will place every thing around you, in a plea&s;ant and agreeable light, while envy and pride, ambi|tion, anger and malice, or any one of them, or any other untoward and irregular pa&s;&s;ion, will render you incapable of enjoying the mo&s;t advan|tageous condition.</P>
<P>The due government of your temper and pa&s;&s;ions will not only qualify you to enjoy the comforts that a bounteous providence may afford you, with chearfulne&s;s and delight, but, it will enable you to bear the afflictions that may befall you, with evenne&s;s and fortitude.</P>
<P>Such an happy &s;tate of mind will al&s;o di&s;po&s;e you to tho&s;e offices of good will to others, which form &s;o great a part of your duties, and from which ari&s;e &s;ome of the mo&s;t &s;olid and delicate plea&s;ures, that human nature is capable of enjoying.</P>

<P>Remember, that in the &s;ame degree, as the government of your hearts is nece&s;&s;ary for your happine&s;s in this world, it is al&s;o, for that of the world to come. It is impo&s;&s;ible, in the nature of things, that &s;uch a di&s;orderly and turbulent &s;tate of the &s;oul, as renders it unfit for the enjoyment of God here, &s;hould be capable of enjoying him hereafter, in that &s;tate, where complete happine&s;s depends on the unvarying order of all its powers.</P>
<P>Keep always before you, the precepts and example of the &s;on of God, in who&s;e life, you will find the mo&s;t &s;hining in&s;tances of love, patience and moderation. The more you attend to the&s;e, and the more you imbibe of tho&s;e divine principles which influenced his conduct, the more certainly you will &s;ucceed, in every amiable and virtuous di&s;po&s;ition, till love to mankind will be your governing principle, next to that of love and obe|dience to God.</P>
<P>And to in&s;ure you all the comforts and advantages of &s;ubduing your pa&s;&s;ions, I recommend it to you, above all, to commit your&s;elves to the tuition and conduct of the &s;pirit of God.

<P>We come now to con&s;ider the evils of an exce&s;|&s;ive attachment to plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>Plea&s;ure is the idol of all ages of life, and all conditions of mankind and while there is a capacity of enjoying it, no one can be indifferent to its impre&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>But, it is in the &s;ea&s;on of youth, when health and vigor of body ea&s;e and chearfulne&s;s of mind, and quickne&s;s of &s;en&s;ibility, peculiarly qualify for the enjoyment of it, that it is mo&s;t inten&s;ely pur|&s;ued; and as it is then, that the heart is mo&s;t under its impre&s;&s;ion; it is then al&s;o, that it is mo&s;t dan|gerous to its votaries Before I go farther it will be proper to mention, that I am not con&s;idering plea&s;ure in the large&s;t meaning of the word. Tho&s;e refined enjoyments which ari&s;e from the pur&s;uit and acqui&s;ition of knowledge; from ta&s;te and &s;entiment; from friend&s;hip and religion, can never be de&s;er|ving of blame, as they cannot be pur&s;ued to exce&s;s. I intend tho&s;e only which ari&s;e from the gratification of our animal de&s;ires and appetites; and the love of amu&s;ement.</P>
<P>The principal evils of plea&s;ure, in this view, are</P>
<P N="1">1. It impairs the animal powers and capacities.</P>
<P>The&s;e are fitted by the con&s;titution of God, for a certain degree of exertion, or excitement; and it is only within this degree, that they can either yield their proper &s;atisfactions; or be pre&s;erved in their natural &s;trength.</P>
<P>However firm and vigorous the con&s;titution, exce&s;&s;ive gratification of the appetites, e&s;pecially
<PB N="56" REF="046207_0055_1020F8ECC9EBCB80">
when habitual, will, by degrees, impair and de&s;troy the &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>It occa&s;ions weakne&s;s, ob&s;tructions, pain and di&s;ea&s;e, which, if they do not immediately ter|minate in death; will certainly incapacitate the body, for its proper enjoyments and &s;ervices.</P>
<P>It is thus, that multitudes of young men fitted by their con&s;titutions, for a cour&s;e of vigorous action, for toil, hard&s;hip and enterprize, are early reduced to the infirmities of old age; to bear an in&s;ipid and weari&s;ome life, in a &s;tate u&s;ele&s;s to them&s;elves and others.</P>
<P>Some, indeed, by rea&s;on of extraordinary &s;trength, are able to hold out in a cour&s;e of habitual intem|perance, to a con&s;iderable advance in years. But, for one &s;uch, a thou&s;and are de&s;troyed, before they have "lived out half their days." And of tho&s;e who &s;urvive their exce&s;&s;es, beyond middle life; there is &s;carcely one, who does not dearly pay for them, with a complication of bodily mi&s;eries.</P>
<P>Not only is the body injured, by exce&s;s in the lower and gro&s;&s;er gratifications of animal nature, but al&s;o, by an inten&s;e pur&s;uit of tho&s;e plea&s;ures which ari&s;e from various &s;orts of amu&s;ement. Of the&s;e, there are &s;ome that immediately affect it, by exciting to violent or long continued exerci&s;e, that wa&s;tes the animal &s;pirits, and impairs the &s;trength. There are others, that affect the body, indirectly, by throwing the mind into di&s;quietude, vexation, and other irregular emotions, that gradually im|pair the health and con&s;titution.</P>
<P>Among the former, the mo&s;t u&s;ual in this part of the country is hunting, which however innocent and u&s;eful, when moderately pur&s;ued, is very pernicious, by being too frequently practi&s;ed, and
<PB N="57" REF="046207_0056_1020F9172879EC58">
often continued, till the &s;trength and &s;pirits are fairly exhau&s;ted.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The great quantity of under-growth and boggy ground, in this country, render this exerci&s;e very laborious; and being often pur&s;ued in very hot wea|ther, breaks down many good con&s;titutions.</NOTE></P>
<P>Among the latter, gaming is very pernicious, being always attended with anxiety, and often producing violent anger, and the vexations of di&s;|appointment, which cannot fail of di&s;turbing the order and regularity of the animal functions. It is al&s;o injurious, by being often practi&s;ed, at tho&s;e hours of the night, when the body ought to enjoy the refre&s;hment of re&s;t and &s;leep. Its injuries to the health, are not, indeed, u&s;ually, as &s;oon per|ceived, or, as violent as tho&s;e of many other pur|&s;uits; but, they are equally certain, in one degree or another; and e&s;pecially to per&s;ons of weak and delicate con&s;titutions.</P>
<P>They who pur&s;ue them, in the&s;e circum&s;tances, are &s;o much the more blameable, as they are the more liable to be affected by them. And even they who&s;e &s;trength of con&s;titution renders them le&s;s &s;en&s;ible of immediate injury, ought to con&s;ider, that to impair their health, in any mea&s;ure, by unprofitable pur&s;uits, is to incur the guilt of &s;acri|ficing &s;olid good, without the hope of equivalent compen&s;ation.</P>
<P>On the whole, wherever men pur&s;ue their plea|&s;ures as the main object of their pur&s;uits; in what|ever they are placed, health and vigour of body are ea&s;ily &s;acrificed to them. Every in&s;tance of exce&s;s is, in a le&s;s, or greater degree, injurious, and the oftener it is repeated, the more certainly it is de&s;tructive. A good con&s;titution may bear it
<PB N="58" REF="046207_0057_1020F8F083F30068">
for a time; but, &s;ooner or later, it will &s;ink under it.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the injuries which an immoderate love of plea&s;ure occa&s;ions to the body, it is al&s;o hurtful to the pre&s;ent intere&s;ts of men, in the affairs and bu&s;ine&s;s of the world. "The drunkard and the glutton &s;hall come to poverty, and drow&s;ine&s;s &s;hall cover a man with rags."</P>
<P>It is univer&s;ally true, that when it is inten&s;ely pur&s;ued, bu&s;ine&s;s mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be neglected. Care and u&s;eful employment can be regarded only as things of &s;econdary moment, while the appetites mu&s;t be gratified, at any expence.</P>
<P>And, while this is the ca&s;e, honor and reputa|tion mu&s;t al&s;o be made a &s;acrifice. It is thus, that many who have &s;et out in the world, with the be&s;t advantages, have gradually, perhaps in a very little time, &s;unk into reproach and di&s;grace, from which they have never recovered. "He that loveth plea&s;ure &s;hall be a poor man, he that loveth wine and oil, &s;hall not be rich."</P>
<P>No expen&s;e indeed, is equal to the wants of men devoted to their plea&s;ures.</P>
<P>They can &s;oon exhau&s;t the large&s;t e&s;tate, where they are called upon, by the importunacy of a plea&s;urable di&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P>It is a con&s;uming fire, which, the more you throw into it, the more inten&s;ely it burns, till it wa&s;tes all within its reach.</P>
<P>And while it de&s;troys all the intere&s;ts of the body, and the reputation, which is &s;till more valuable&mdash; it is al&s;o</P>
<P N="2">2. Injurious to the acqui&s;ition of knowledge; and de&s;tructive of moral and religious &s;entiments.</P>
<P>It is hardly to be expected, that he who is intent on his plea&s;ures &s;hould be anxious for the improve|ment
<PB N="59" REF="046207_0058_1020F919D66EB4D0">
of his mind. The&s;e objects are &s;o different, that the one mu&s;t unavoidably cla&s;h with the other. And therefore it u&s;ually happens, that men devoted to their plea&s;ures, &s;eldom attain to di&s;tinction in u&s;eful and important knowledge. This requires, not only elegance of ta&s;te; but retirement from the world, and &s;teadine&s;s of application; neither of which can be expected, where the love of plea|&s;ure is the reigning di&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P>Animal gratification, and trifling amu&s;ements, deba&s;e the inclinations, and create an aver&s;ion from tho&s;e objects, in attention to which the under&s;tand|ing is enlarged and &s;trengthened. The be&s;t natural genius mu&s;t fall a &s;acrifice, where the mind is in love with plea&s;ure, as its principal object. And &s;o it has happened that young men of the mo&s;t promi&s;ing ta|lents, have &s;unk, after rai&s;ing the highe&s;t expectations, into a di&s;reli&s;h of every valuable pur&s;uit and improve|ment; till &s;carce a trace of their genius and abilities has remained. It has even been the ca&s;e, that the be&s;t capacity for knowledge, has &s;ometimes been &s;o impaired, by the love of plea&s;ure, as to be reduced to a &s;tate little better than idioti&s;m it&s;elf.</P>
<P>This, if there were nothing more, is &s;ad de&s;truc|tion of the great and excellent powers of the &s;oul. But, the effects of plea&s;ure are &s;till more formidable. It de&s;troys moral and religious &s;entiments. The&s;e are the highe&s;t order of our endowments, and qualify us for enjoyments, as much &s;uperior to tho&s;e which depend on our intellectual powers, as the latter are to the highe&s;t animal &s;en&s;ation. It is by the&s;e we are capable of acting from a &s;en&s;e of the authority of God; and with a view to his approbation, and the rewards of piety and obedience. This &s;en&s;e is the great rule by which our conduct, motives and enjoyments, are to be governed, in reference to the
<PB N="60" REF="046207_0059_1020F8F314D3E4D8">
la&s;t and highe&s;t purpo&s;es of our being&mdash;And &s;o far as it maintains its due authority in the &s;oul, we &s;hall be influenced to live "&s;oberly," in the u&s;e of our appetiies and pa&s;&s;ions, "righteou&s;ly," in regard to the demands which others have upon us, and "godly," in the practice of tho&s;e duties which we immediately owe to God him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Yet, great and important as this principle is, both for our conduct and happine&s;s; an exce&s;&s;ive attach|ment to plea&s;ure has a direct tendency to render it entirely ineffectual for the ends it was intended to an&s;wer. And this is more certainly the ca&s;e, where it is pur&s;ued in the gratification of the animal appe|tites. There is &s;o great a difference between the principles of the fle&s;h and the &s;pirit, that it is im|po&s;&s;ible in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of human nature, they can be equally regarded. Where one is predomi|nant, the other mu&s;t be proportionably undervalued and neglected. "If ye live after the fle&s;h, ye &s;hall die: but, if ye through the &s;pirit, do mortify the deeds of the body, ye &s;hall live." The pur&s;uit of &s;en&s;ual indulgence as the principal care and hap|pine&s;s of life, argues, that a &s;en&s;e of the authority of God, and a regard to his favor, as the highe&s;t good of a rea&s;onable and immortal being, are over-ruled by the intere&s;ts and demands of the body; and that the &s;oul, as to its highe&s;t and mo&s;t important exerci&s;es and enjoyments, is in a &s;tate of death. The apo&s;tle has therefore expre&s;sly declared, that "to be carnally minded is death." And we accordingly find, that, where the love of plea&s;ure, in whatever it be placed, is the reigning principle of men: if they do not run into the gro&s;&s;e&s;t irre|gularities; they at lea&s;t di&s;cover a di&s;like to the mo&s;t important duties of morality and religion, which evidently proves them to be "dead in &s;in."</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="046207_0060_1020F920ACF76210">The pernicious and de&s;tructive effects of exce&s;|&s;ive plea&s;ure are &s;till farther manife&s;t, by this, that it often prompts men, for the relief of their con|&s;ciences, and for pur&s;uing their favorite object, with as little re&s;traint and remor&s;e as po&s;&s;ible, to rea&s;on them&s;elves out of the belief of a providence in this world, and a &s;tate of retribution in the next.</P>
<P>And therefore it u&s;ually happens, that your pro|fe&s;&s;ed advocates for &s;en&s;ual plea&s;ures, are either profe&s;&s;ed infidels; or approach as near to it, as a regard to decency and their characters will allow them.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t &s;till be granted, that an exce&s;&s;ive love of plea&s;ure may be compatible with ju&s;t &s;entiments of religion. But, this conce&s;&s;ion is &s;o far from weakening my argument, that it abundantly con|firms it. For, how ruinous mu&s;t be that pa&s;&s;ion, which is &s;trong enough to out face the &s;olemn te&s;ti|mony of rea&s;on and con&s;cience, reclaiming again&s;t it! Let men think ever &s;o ju&s;tly, on the obliga|tions and advantages of religion; while they are en&s;laved to this, or any other pa&s;&s;ion, the clear|ne&s;s of their knowledge &s;erves only to illu&s;trate the power of the principal that rules them.</P>
<P>They are in the &s;ame ca&s;e with tho&s;e of whom the apo&s;tle &s;peaks, "who knowing the judgment of God, that they who do &s;uch things are worthy of death; not only do the &s;ame, but have plea&s;ure in them that do them."</P>
<P>Finally, it follows from the premi&s;es, that a life of &s;en&s;uality and plea&s;ure, whether it be pur&s;ued in a coar&s;er or more refined way, is utterly incom|patible with tho&s;e pure and &s;piritual affections which are e&s;&s;ential to piety and devotion.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="046207_0061_1020F8F725026938">While the heart is engro&s;&s;ed by tho&s;e objects which are adapted only to the body, or &s;erve to gratify the vanity of the mind; it is impo&s;&s;ible it &s;hould take plea&s;ure in the contemplation of the holine&s;s of God, or tho&s;e truths of revelation which are de&s;igned to mortify our love of this "pre|&s;ent evil world&punc;" or in tho&s;e &s;olemn and humbling approaches to the mo&s;t Holy One, which &s;erve to prepare the &s;oul for the exerci&s;es and enjoyments of his immediate pre&s;ence. Acts of devotion per|formed with &s;uch a &s;tate of the affections, are &s;o far from being a matter of choice and delight; that they are ever attended with reluctance, di&s;|gu&s;t and pain. From this it evidently follows, that habits of intemperate &s;en&s;uality, and of vain amu&s;e|ments are as incon&s;i&s;tent with the character of a true chri&s;tian as it is impo&s;&s;ible, at once, to "mind the things of the fle&s;h," and "the things of the &s;pirit" to be "enmity again&s;t God," and "&s;ubject to the law of God" or that the &s;oul &s;hould be &s;piritually alive, and dead, at the &s;ame time.</P>
<P>It was one great de&s;ign of Chri&s;t, in "giving him&s;elf for us, that he might reedeem us from all iniquity, and purify to him&s;elf, a peculiar people zealous or good works."</P>
<P>And it is an e&s;&s;ential part in the character of every true chri&s;tian, that he is "wa&s;hed &s;ancti|fied and ju&s;tified, in the name of the Lord Je&s;us and by the &s;pirit of our God"&mdash;which can never be &s;aid of tho&s;e who are "deceived, &s;erving divers lu&s;ts and vanities," without contradicting the who&s;e tenor of the go&s;pel.

The&s;e are all obvious to the eye.

<P>If the fruits of a life of plea&s;ure were only tho&s;e that have now been mentioned, how unworthy is it of the name, and how much to be dreaded! But the&s;e are not all. "The end of the&s;e things is death." All the mi&s;eries that can attend it, in this life, though often &s;o great, as to render men quite in&s;upportable to them&s;elves, and impatient to terminate their wretched exi&s;tence, will bear no compari&s;on with tho&s;e which are to follow, when the fugitive delights for which they &s;acrificed the &s;olid plea&s;ures of rea&s;on and religion, will be forever out of their reach; and every capacity

<P>Tell me, then, I be&s;eech you, what there is in the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite plea&s;ures of &s;en&s;e, of amu&s;ement and gaiety, that is worthy to be purcha&s;ed at the expence of your &s;ouls?</P>
<P>Were they even to be perfect, for the longe&s;t duration you can hope for, upon earth, or were they with the imperfections, vici&s;&s;itudes, and pains that attend them, to continue for ages; in either ca&s;e, they could never be a compen&s;ation for only the hazard of being mi&s;erable at la&s;t. But, &s;ince they certainly lead to final and irretrievable ruin, it is nothing le&s;s than madne&s;s to pur&s;ue them.</P>
<P>I will di&s;mi&s;s the &s;ubject after giving you the following directions.</P>
<P>Endeavor to inform your&s;elves of the true boun|daries, and u&s;e of tho&s;e enjoyments which depend on the &s;en&s;es. They are intended for important purpo&s;es, which they can an&s;wer, only when u&s;ed in &s;ubordination to tho&s;e which ari&s;e from know|ledge, virtue and piety. And their &s;ub&s;erviency to the&s;e is the rule by which they are to be judged of, as innocent and allowable.</P>
<P>And by the &s;ame rule, you are to judge of the lawfulne&s;s or expediency of any amu&s;ements to which you may be inclined. The de&s;ign of the&s;e &s;hould always be to relieve the mind from the &s;e|verity of our cares, with a view to pur&s;ue them again with alacrity and vigour. In any other view, they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> wa&s;te of time, and di&s;&s;ipation of thought, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> innocent &s;oever in them&s;elves, become injurious <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;ame degree as they divert the mind from the pro&s;ecution of our &s;erious and indi&s;pen&s;ible duties.</P>
<P>Young men in health can &s;eldom need amu&s;ements; e&s;pecially where their employments are neither

confining, nor require &s;evere application of the mind. The bu&s;ine&s;s of planters in this part of the country, where few take any &s;hare in the labor, is little more than an agreeable amu&s;ment. To fill up the intervals of lei&s;ure from the&s;e cares, I re|commend to you the reading of u&s;eful books. This will, at the &s;ame time, improve you in knowledge and ta&s;te; and fit you for acting a more re&s;pectable and u&s;eful part in the community. Should it an|&s;wer no other end, it may at lea&s;t, &s;ave you from the temptation of adopting expedients to pa&s;s off your lei&s;ure hours, that may end in the ruin of your morals, and the peace of your minds.</P>
<P>Avoid all habits of indulgence that are not directly favorable to all the purpo&s;es of your being.</P>
<P>Whatever in the lea&s;t degree interferes with thefe, is not only unlawful, but pernicious. Should you fall into habits of &s;en&s;uality, in the time of your youth, you will probably continue in them, 'till the time of age, or what is much more probable, they will cut you off "in the mid&s;t of your days."</P>

<P>Be con&s;tantly then on your guard again&s;t this greate&s;t enemy to the body and the &s;oul. Shun all amu&s;ements, and a&s;&s;ociations that would tempt you into this way of ruin. Ob&s;erve with attention the evils that attend tho&s;e who are given to this exce&s;s; and though you &s;hould be influenced by no higher con&s;iderations, the&s;e alone can hardly fail of keeping you at the greate&s;t di&s;tance from it.</P>
<P>Finally, cultivate a love for tho&s;e plea&s;ures which ari&s;e from the offices of benevolence to man|kind, and the practice of piety towards God. In the latter e&s;pecially, you will find the mo&s;t com|po&s;ed enjoyment, and &s;uch as will never cloy or di&s;appoint you&mdash;The more you enjoy of the&s;e, the more you will di&s;regard the plea&s;ures of &s;en&s;e; which mu&s;t ever grow weaker, the more frequently they are repeated. The contemplation of the perfections, works and word of God, and the other exerci&s;es of devotion by which the heart is improved in preparation for another and nobler &s;tate of being, will give you that peace of mind, and tho&s;e chearful hopes of future and eternal feli|city, that are worth being purcha&s;ed, for one hour, by the highe&s;t enjoyments of &s;en&s;e, for a whole age.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="046207_0066_1020F92871CEE290">Nor need you de&s;pi&s;e any even of the inferior enjoyments of your nature, which God hath pre|pared for you, and allowed you to u&s;e.</P>
<P>But, it is only within the bounds which he hath pre&s;cribed, that they can be lawful, rea&s;onable, or &s;afe. With the words of Solomon on a particular ca&s;e of intemperate plea&s;ure, I conclude the &s;ubject, to which they may be univer&s;ally applied.</P>
<P>"Let not thine heart decline to her ways; go not a&s;tray in her paths. For &s;he hath ca&s;t down many wounded; yea, many &s;trong men have been &s;lain by her. Her hou&s;e is the way to hell, going down to the chambers of death."</P>

<P N="2">II. The great rule by which your hearts and lives are to be governed. And becau&s;e I have al|ready, perhaps, exceeded the mea&s;ure of your patience will compri&s;e what is nece&s;&s;ary at pre&s;ent, to be &s;aid on the &s;ubject, in as narrow a compa&s;s, as its importance to your happine&s;s will admit of. This rule is the word of God, of which in com|mendation of its excellence, the apo&s;tle &s;aith&mdash; "All the &s;cripture is given by in&s;piration of God; and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for cor|rection, for in&s;truction in righteou&s;ne&s;s, that the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furni&s;hed unto all good works;" and it certainly an&s;wers in all re&s;pects, to this incomparable character. It gives as full an account of the characters of God, and his di&s;pen&s;ations to mankind, as is nece&s;&s;ary for us to know, at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>It al&s;o contains a plain and full account of our duties, and the principles on which they are to be performed.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="046207_0067_1020F8FE350D7F48">As the fir&s;t and highe&s;t of the&s;e, and the founda|tion of all the re&s;t, it enjoins the belief of one God, that "he is to be wor&s;hipped in &s;pirit and in truth," that we are to love him with all the heart, that is unfeignedly and &s;upremely, to reve|rence his name; to obey all his commands; to &s;ub|mit with humility, to all his di&s;pen&s;ations; to tru&s;t in his mercy, power and faithfulne&s;s; to pray to him, for what we need; to prai&s;e him, for all we receive; to confe&s;s to him our &s;ins; to &s;eek his favor, as our &s;afety and happine&s;s, here and here|after; and to refer all we enjoy, &s;uffer and do, to his will, as the &s;tandard, and to his glory, as the end of them all.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to mankind it directs us "to love our neighbour, as our&s;elves;" and what&s;oever we would "that others &s;hould do to us, to do even the &s;ame to them." To entertain a &s;incere affec|tion and good will to all mankind; and to act to|wards them, in all ca&s;es, as we would think right for them to act towards us, were we in their cir|cum&s;tances, and they in ours&mdash;A rule intelligible to all capacities, and adapted to all the relations of mankind to one another It includes all tho&s;e acts of good will, mercy and ju&s;tice, patience and conde&s;cen&s;ion, which we &s;tand in need of, from one another; and which form, as &s;o many links, the great chain which binds men together, in a &s;tate of &s;ociety.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to our own happine&s;s, it directs us to a &s;ober and temperate u&s;e of our appetites and pa&s;&s;ions, in the enjoyment of pre&s;ent good, to be contented with our lot, without murmuring or di&s;|tre&s;&s;ing anxiety, in the mo&s;t unplea&s;ant and trying circum&s;tances, and to &s;et our principal affections "on the things that are above," and make it out
<PB N="69" REF="046207_0068_1020ECA698922558">
main care and concern to &s;ecure the&s;e, as our por|tion, at la&s;t. All the&s;e directions are delivered in various places, in plain, conci&s;e, and authoritative language. And in order to engage us to the &s;teady practice of our duties, it al&s;o propo&s;eth the mo&s;t important and affecting motives. The amount of the&s;e is, the promi&s;e of the &s;pecial favor, protec|tion and coun&s;el of God, through the whole of life, &s;upport in afflictions, and the &s;anctified u&s;e of them, for the advancement of our &s;piritual good and comfort, and our preparation for another world, together with as much of the peri&s;hable goods of this life, as God &s;hall &s;ee be&s;t for us; and a certain and everla&s;ting happine&s;s in the next. With re&s;pect to the encouragements to obedience, you will ob&s;erve a material difference between tho&s;e of the Old Te&s;tament and the New. In the former, they were immediately the advantages of the pre&s;ent life, though they no doubt, ultimately pointed to the next. In the latter, there are no &s;pecial pro|mi&s;es of worldly pro&s;perity, but of what is infi|nitely more valuable, &s;piritual and everla&s;ting bene|fits. Indeed, the &s;pirit of the two di&s;pen&s;ations is &s;o different, that in the &s;ame degree, as we hope for the &s;pecial ble&s;&s;ings of the go&s;pel, we mu&s;t be indifferent to the mere advantages of the pre&s;ent world. The &s;ame ob&s;ervation may be made, with re&s;pect to the threatenings again&s;t the di&s;obedient. In the former, they are pre&s;ent judgments, and calamities; in the latter, they point to the "ever|la&s;ting puni&s;hment" of the final retribution. The&s;e ob&s;ervations are made with a view to guard you again&s;t the mi&s;take of applying to your&s;elves the promi&s;es that were made to the Jewi&s;h nation, and which cea&s;ed on the coming of Chri&s;t, and the di&s;covery of "a better inheritance," than was made known to them.</P>
<P><PB N="70" REF="046207_0069_1020F9015923DE08">The &s;pecial encouragements to faith in Chri&s;t&punc; to the profe&s;&s;ion of this faith, and obedience to his commands, "through good report, and through evil report," are the promi&s;es of the pardon of &s;in, the &s;anctification of our natures, and an in&s;e|perable union with him, as the means of obtaining all nece&s;&s;ary &s;piritual benefits, and the &s;ure pledge of our being admitted at la&s;t, to "be with him, where he is, to behold his glory."</P>
<P>The &s;criptures al&s;o point out to us the true way of &s;alvation. They inform us, that "Chri&s;t died, the ju&s;t for the unju&s;t, that he might bring us to God."</P>
<P>And that the benefits of his atonement are to be obtained only by faith in his merits, obedience to his laws, and the imitation of his example, in holine&s;s of heart and life.</P>
<P>The go&s;pel is founded entirely on the&s;e principles, which are plainly and forcibly laid down in the &s;criptures&mdash;That in con&s;equence of &s;in, all men are liable to the pains of eternal death, that no repentance on the part of the &s;inner, is meritorious for his reprieve from the &s;entence pa&s;&s;ed again&s;t him, and that he has no power of him&s;elf, either to change the natural &s;tate of his heart; or to per|form any &s;ervice acceptable to God. And there|fore, that the atonement of Chri&s;t was nece&s;&s;ary, both for his pardon and &s;anctification, as the only way of his deliverance.</P>
<P>The importance of &s;uch a revelation to mankind will appear in the &s;tronge&s;t light, by the following undeniable propo&s;itions&mdash;1. That the wi&s;e&s;t and be&s;t of men who ever appeared in the world, with only the advantages of natural rea&s;on, were never able to di&s;cover, with certainty, the &s;tate of men after death, or even that they would exi&s;t at all,
<PB N="71" REF="046207_0070_1020F92CD3D57BF0">
nor the way of wor&s;hipping God, &s;uitably to his true character; nor even ju&s;t and rational ideas of his perfections and providence.</P>
<P N="2">2. That no man previous to his embracing the go&s;pel, either exerci&s;eth true repentance for his &s;ins, or expects the favor of God, as a mere act of mercy, or de&s;ires &s;uch an happine&s;s in another life, as proceeds only from &s;piritual and holy affec|tions, in this. So true is it, that "the natural man receiveth not the things of the &s;pirit of God; neither can he know them, becau&s;e they are &s;piri|tually di&s;cerned:" and that only through the me|dium of the go&s;pel revelation.</P>
<P>If any thing therefore, can &s;et forth the &s;upreme excellence of the &s;criptures, and effectually recom|mend them to the e&s;teem and veneration of mankind, it is, that they contain every thing nece&s;&s;ary to be known, and practi&s;ed, in order to our pre&s;ent and future happine&s;s, and that they are the &s;ole &s;tan|dard by which our religious opinions, our temper, our conduct and hopes, are to be judged of as good or bad.</P>
<P>To this view of them, I might add, that they contain a faithful and mo&s;t intere&s;ting hi&s;tory of the mo&s;t important events that have ever happened. The creation of the world, the fall, the deluge, the re-peopling the world; after that memorable calamity, the divi&s;ion of the fir&s;t language, the calling of Abraham, with whom the covenant of grace was fir&s;t formally made, the deliverance of the I&s;raelites from Egypt, the giving the moral law, written by the finger of God on two tables of &s;tone, the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the church and polity of the Jews, by the expre&s;s appointment of God him&s;elf, and his conduct towards that peo|ple, by extraordinary interpo&s;itions, till within
<PB N="72" REF="046207_0071_1020F9055D55EB10">
about four hundred years before the Me&s;&s;ias, toge|gether with the records of the characters of the mo&s;t remarkable per&s;ons, in the cour&s;e of this hi&s;tory, patriarchs, judges, kings, prophets, and the various prophecies, of the per&s;on, character, and kingdom of Chri&s;t, the&s;e are all to be found in the Old Te&s;tament. After that follows an account of the birth of the &s;on of God, with the mo&s;t minute detail of time, place and other circum&s;tances to atte&s;t its truth, then his doctrines, miracles and &s;ufferings, during the time of his public mini&s;try, then his death, re&s;urrection, and a&s;cen&s;ion; after that the public miracle of the gift of the holy &s;pirit to his di&s;ciples, on the day of Penteco&s;t, then the preaching, journies, &s;ufferings and mira|cles of the apo&s;tles, till the fini&s;hing of the &s;acred canon, in the revelation made to the apo&s;tle John. All this va&s;t hi&s;tory including nearly the time of four thou&s;and one hundred years is related in the mo&s;t &s;imple and affecting language; and its authen|ticity undi&s;puted by all men of true learning, can|dor and piety. And I will venture to &s;ay, that for every thing great and intere&s;ting in narrative, as well as for &s;ublimity of &s;entiment, and purity and excellence of morality, it is infinitely &s;uperior to every thing produced by the mere wit of man.</P>
<P>And were it to be read, only with a view to en|tertainment, there is certainly no other book that can equally &s;urprize and delight the mind, or move and affect the heart.</P>
<P>But, I hope, the &s;hort view I have given of its contents and importance, will induce you to peru&s;e and &s;tudy it, from an higher motive, namely, to be in&s;tructed in your duty, in order to be happy in the favor and likene&s;s of God, its adorable au|thor.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="046207_0072_1020F92E6050A0F8">Make it a part of your daily bu&s;ine&s;s to read this divine book, with attention, and &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s, &s;uitable to its own dignity, and your intere&s;t in it.</P>

<P>The book of P&s;alms is an excellent collection of devotional exerci&s;es, adapted to almo&s;t every &s;tate of the heart, and every circum&s;tance of the life. In reading of the&s;e, it will be nece&s;&s;ary for you to con&s;ider the different &s;pirit of the di&s;pen&s;ation, under which the authors of them wrote, from that of the mild and forgiving temper of the go&s;pel. Of prai&s;e, adoration, confe&s;&s;ion and penitential &s;orrow, of tru&s;t and confidence in God, you will find in them the mo&s;t excellent examples, which cannot fail to affect and a&s;&s;i&s;t you, in all your reli|gious exerci&s;es.</P>
<P>In the book of Proverbs, you will find mo&s;t ex|cellent maxims of wi&s;dom and prudence&punc; for the conduct of life, in almo&s;t all the relations you can &s;u&s;tain. To trea&s;ure up the&s;e in your memory, to

have them always in readine&s;s for u&s;e, according to your circum&s;tances, will be of great importance.</P>
<P>But, it is particularly in the New Te&s;tament, that I would have you to be mo&s;t intimately ver&s;ed. The doctrines of Chri&s;t are "the words of eternal life," his conduct a perfect example of benevolence and piety, and his &s;ufferings and promi&s;es, the foundation and &s;upport of your hopes. What he taught is largely enforced and explained by the apo&s;tles, in their different letters to the churches, and di&s;cour&s;es on particular occa&s;ions&mdash;And all his excellencies that are intended for the imitation of his followers, his love, diligence, patience, humi|lity and piety, are beautifully exemplified in their lives.</P>
<P>Of the doctrines of the &s;criptures, be mo&s;t con|cerned to inform your&s;elves in tho&s;e which lie at the foundation of the go&s;pel, and are nece&s;&s;ary for the faith and practice of all chri&s;tians. With re|&s;pect to the&s;e, allow me to give you one caution, and that is, never think of rejecting any of them, becau&s;e you cannot entirely comprehend it, or &s;olve all the difficulties that may &s;eem to ari&s;e from it. Tho&s;e very things which the pride and perver&s;ene&s;s of our rea&s;on have laid hold of, as objections again&s;t the whole of the revelation, are the highe&s;t and mo&s;t infallible proofs of its authenticity. It is uni|ver&s;ally one character of the works of God that they cannot be fully comprehended by the human under|&s;tanding. If every thing were perfectly intelligi|ble in the &s;cripture, it would &s;eem to want one e&s;&s;ential mark of its divine original. You will find every thing nece&s;&s;ary for you to know, &s;uffi|ciently clear and intelligible. And while you have enough both for your duty and happine&s;s, you ought chearfully to &s;ubmit your faith to the re&s;t,
<PB N="75" REF="046207_0074_1020F93335ABA790">
and think it &s;ufficiently happy for you, to have a good hope, that if it &s;hould be nece&s;&s;ary, in &s;ome future period of your being, God will reveal to you even the&s;e things.</P>
<P>"All things are po&s;&s;ible to him that believeth." With &s;uch a faith in Chri&s;t as will purify your hearts, and overcome the world, you will &s;ur|mount all the weakne&s;&s;es, errors, and corruptions, that now attend you; and by following the &s;acred light which he hath &s;hed upon the world by his word and &s;pirit, you will be daily growing wi&s;er and better, till you &s;hall "&s;ee him as he is, and know even as you are known."</P>
<P>To have &s;uch a ble&s;&s;edne&s;s in expectation, on the true grounds of the go&s;pel, is an "hope that ma|keth not a&s;hamed." The world will ever di&s;appoint and &s;hame you&mdash;Riches and power will di&s;appoint you, honors and plea&s;ures will di&s;appoint you; wherever you look, you will &s;ee nothing but di&s;ap|pointment and &s;orrow, "vanity and vexation of &s;pirit." But, with the oracles of eternal wi&s;dom in your hands, and the divine &s;pirit in your hearts; with your de&s;ires and hopes fixed on Heaven, and your labors and cares ultimately directed thither, you will find every thing turn to your good; and you will be fixed on a rock that will &s;tand unmoved, when "the fa&s;hion of the world &s;hall have alto|gether pa&s;&s;ed away, and all the&s;e things &s;hall have been di&s;&s;olved." I have now fini&s;hed my de&s;ign, and for the pre&s;ent, take my leave of you; not without a hope, that I &s;hall &s;hare with &s;ome of you, in that ble&s;&s;edne&s;s, to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of which it was the view of this addre&s;s to lead you.</P>

<HEAD><HI>APPENDIX.</HI> An extract from a Sermon preached at Wappetaw, 1&s;t day of January <HI>1790.</HI></HEAD>
<P>"THERE is nothing in which we are more deceived, than the e&s;timate we u&s;ually make of the few years of our duration upon earth, and the mi&s;take &s;eems to ari&s;e from the manner of our viewing it.</P>
<P>From the pre&s;ent time we commonly look for|ward to any definite period, taking the intermediate &s;pace in the gro&s;s, without regarding the divi&s;ions which compo&s;e it, and the ha&s;tine&s;s with which the &s;maller run into the greater, till the whole is &s;pent.</P>
<P>By this &s;uperficial way of reckoning a few years, or months, or even a &s;ingle one of them, appears to us in pro&s;pect, much longer than it is; and ad|mitting of much more bu&s;ine&s;s and enjoyment, than we ever find realized. And e&s;pecially, by this fal|lacy, the u&s;ual boundary of life appears to youth, at a very di&s;tant remove; and that, &s;uppo&s;ing they &s;hould reach it, which almo&s;t every one expects, they will have had &s;ufficient time for accompli&s;hing all the &s;chemes they have projected.</P>
<P>But how different is the view, when we take our time, as it were to pieces, allowing to the &s;everal ways of pa&s;&s;ing it, their re&s;pective portions, and reckoning only upon that which can be employed in the main bu&s;ine&s;s that engages our attention!</P>
<P>Let us &s;uppo&s;e that eight hours in the twenty-four are pa&s;&s;ed in bed, which is probably the ca&s;e with a great part of mankind, that two are &s;pent at the table; which is perhaps one le&s;s, than is taken by tho&s;e who are in affluent, or ea&s;y circum|&s;tances, and that only two more are &s;pent in relax|ation, and occa&s;ional pau&s;es from our main pur|&s;uit.</P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="046207_0076_1020F936EB98B0B8">By this computation, one half of life whether longer or &s;horter, is taken up with the nece&s;&s;ary re|fre&s;hments of the body, and reliefs of the mind.</P>
<P>Let us allow farther, the fir&s;t &s;even years of our time, before we begin to think of any &s;erious pur|po&s;e, and nine more for making preparation for the part we are to act. We will then &s;ay, that at &s;ixteen we &s;et out in the cour&s;e of action that is to employ the remainder of our life, and that half of this is unavoidably lo&s;t from it. Out of a life of &s;ixty years, it leaves but twenty-two; of one of fifty, but &s;eventeen; and of one of forty, but twelve years, for &s;erious employment&mdash;If to this we &s;hould add the time that is lo&s;t by infirmity, &s;ickne&s;s, and other interruptions; how &s;mall a portion of life is employed in u&s;eful pur&s;uits, and how little is it to be wondered at, that &s;o few of mankind attain to eminence, either in the improve|ments of the mind, or the u&s;ual works of human indu&s;try!</P>
<P>This &s;erves to &s;how us the importance of care|fully improving that &s;mall pittance of our time which the weakne&s;s of our nature allows for u&s;eful application.</P>
<P>Could the whole of our life be employed to the highe&s;t purpo&s;es of our being, without any of the interruptions we now &s;uffer, or were its duration many times longer than it is, or the bu&s;ine&s;s of it of no more con&s;equence than to eat, &s;leep, amu&s;e our minds, and con&s;ult our ea&s;e and gratification, we might in either ca&s;e, be &s;omewhat excu&s;eable for that indolent and trifling way in which &s;o much of it is wa&s;ted.</P>
<P>But&punc; con&s;idering how much there is to be done, how &s;hort a &s;pace is allowed for doing it, and that our immortal duration mu&s;t be happy or mi&s;erable,
<PB N="78" REF="046207_0077_1020F90B5A505FB8">
according as this &s;pace is filled up with u&s;eful, or trifled away in uprofitable pur&s;uits&mdash;to &s;ay nothing more it is inexcu&s;able folly to &s;pend it in &s;upinene&s;s or di&s;&s;ipation.</P>
<P>If the mo&s;t &s;erious and diligent &s;ee rea&s;on, at the clo&s;e of life, to regret the lo&s;s of much unimproved time, how &s;ad a review mu&s;t they have, who&s;e years are exhau&s;ted, before they have found out their value; or have done, or thought of doing any thing above the purpo&s;es of a merely animal ex|i&s;tence!</P>
<P>The preceding e&s;timate of life &s;ugge&s;ts al&s;o to youth, the great importance of entering as early as may be, on a cour&s;e of u&s;eful employment; and of improving their time with that &s;crupulous economy, that its &s;hortne&s;s, and its reference to eternity, ju&s;tly call for.</P>
<P>They may have many years before them, they may have but very few&mdash;And, as the latter is, for many rea&s;ons, the mo&s;t probable, it ought always to be &s;uppo&s;ed. Ju&s;t as long as our life appears to be in pro&s;pect, it will appear to have been &s;hort, in review, and as unimportant as it appears in the former ca&s;e, it will appear valuable, in the latter; when &s;uch a view of it can only &s;erve to &s;hew the folly, and exa&s;perate the mi&s;ery of having neglected it. They who live well, be it ever &s;o &s;hort, will have lived long enough; and they who live illy, be it ever &s;o long, will die too &s;oon."</P>
