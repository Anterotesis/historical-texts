<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE following letters were writ|ten at the reque&s;t of a young friend, and were occa&s;ioned by &s;ome conver&s;a|tions on the&s;e intere&s;ting &s;ubjects: on &s;uch &s;ubjects new di&s;coveries cannot be expected: mo&s;t of the thoughts are &s;uch as the author had met with in the cour&s;e of reading or conver&s;ation, &s;ome few may have been the re&s;ult of his own reflections: he did not think it needful, and in mo&s;t ca&s;es it was not in his power to refer to the authors from whom he had gleaned: he arranged
<PB N="iv" REF="035413_0003_1004C0DF39801F90">the&s;e thoughts according to his own judgment, and the whole are only &s;ketches or outlines not filled up. They were de&s;igned as materials or hints for thinking, and are publi&s;hed with an earne&s;t de&s;ire of drawing the attention of young per&s;ons to the &s;tudy of tho&s;e &s;ubjects which are univer&s;ally important. It is not expected that the&s;e few pages will reform the world, but if they &s;hould catch the attention of a few, and be the means of leading them to inquire and judge for them|&s;elves, they will not have been pub|li&s;hed in vain.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER I.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I NOW &s;end you &s;ome thoughts on the hints which occurred in our late conver&s;ation, relating to the arguments of modern philo&s;ophers, who, while they admit the exi&s;tence of a Deity, di&s;card revelation, and endeavour to deduce the principles of moral rectitude
<PB N="6" REF="035413_0005_1004C0E27AED0D70">from the operations of rea&s;on, una&s;&s;i&s;t|ed by the &s;acred records.</P>
<P>Doctor Wil&s;on, in a work which he publi&s;hed about the middle of the eigh|teenth century, remarked, that, If all the philo&s;ophers and advocates for the &s;ufficiency of natural religion who ever exi&s;ted were a&s;&s;embled in one &s;ynod, their united wi&s;dom could never have di&s;covered this &s;imple propo&s;ition: Gen. i. 1. <HI>In the beginning God created the Heavens and the Earth.</HI>&mdash;And the philo&s;ophers and philo&s;ophical divines &s;et to work to overthrow his a&s;&s;ertion, but they were not able to do it to their own &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="035413_0006_1004C1198B4EE9A8">
Indeed the rea&s;on of their failing need not be wondered at. We have not many channels of acquiring know|ledge: they may be all reduced to the&s;e three, Ob&s;ervation, Rea&s;oning, and Te&s;timony. It will be difficult to find any other &s;ources of information.</P>
<P>Our &s;en&s;es bring us notices of many things, and the more our ob&s;ervations are extended, the greater number of objects fall under our ob&s;ervation; but we need not be told that all the&s;e, how|ever extended, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be <HI>&s;en|&s;ible objects,</HI> and can never furni&s;h us with any primary evidences of the exi&s;tence of a Deity.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="035413_0007_10049A481BEA06D0">
We can rea&s;on, and the things which come under our &s;en&s;ible ob&s;ervations furni&s;h &s;ubjects for analogy, and in this the powers of the human mind are very exten&s;ive. We can compare and judge of the agreement and di&s;agreement, not of things only but al&s;o of ideas, both &s;imple and compound, in their various relations; and the&s;e rea&s;onings and the conclu&s;ions drawn from them are of very great importance in the affairs of man and &s;ociety, but do they lead us a &s;tep nearer to the di&s;covery of a Deity? All our rea&s;onings about &s;en|&s;ible objects and their qualities mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily terminate in &s;en&s;ible objects and their qualities, for the &s;tream can
<PB N="9" REF="035413_0008_1004C11C0DF34230">never ri&s;e higher than the fountain whence it flowed, and it is impo&s;&s;ible that our ideas of the&s;e things can ever carry the mind above things of the like nature.</P>
<P>I know it has often been urged, that the con&s;ideration of our&s;elves and all around us, mu&s;t lead us to think that there mu&s;t be a powerful and in|telligent being who made and directs all things. For in&s;tance, when we &s;ee a piece of mechani&s;m we mu&s;t infer that it was the work of a mechanic, and when we &s;ee a hou&s;e we naturally conclude that &s;omebody built it. True, we very ju&s;tly conclude &s;o, becau&s;e we previou&s;ly know that mechanics make
<PB N="10" REF="035413_0009_1004C0E5C12CD3B8">pieces of mechani&s;m, and that men build hou&s;es: the&s;e are things which have been done, and when we &s;ee them we very naturally infer that &s;uch per&s;ons mu&s;t have made them; but do we know of any per&s;on making a rock, a hill, a river, or a tree? Have we been accu&s;tomed to &s;ee worlds made, that when we &s;ee them we ne|ce&s;&s;arily infer their maker? Here the ca&s;e is widely different, we have nei|ther experience nor ob&s;ervation here to direct our conclu&s;ion. The&s;e things have been as they are, as far back as we can recollect, our parents or an|ce&s;tors, as far back as can be traced, have never &s;een &s;uch things made.
<PB N="11" REF="035413_0010_1004C11FA7F07108">The mo&s;t natural conclu&s;ion, there|fore, perhaps the only one which we could draw from &s;uch premi&s;es, would be, that the&s;e things never had a be|ginning, but had always been as we now perceive them, allowing for &s;uch occa&s;ional variations as we may ob&s;erve in our own day; that &s;eas, rivers, earth, mountains, rocks, &amp;c. had al|ways exi&s;ted; that animals and vege|tables had &s;prung from their parents, as we know they do now; that as the change and &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of &s;ea&s;ons and the general order of the univer&s;e, as far as we can perceive, are pretty uni|form, they have always been &s;o, and we cannot find any rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e
<PB N="12" REF="035413_0011_1004C0E74C5CEAC0">that they ever began to be as they are now. The appearances and order of the univer&s;e may be matters of curi|o&s;ity and of a&s;toni&s;hment, but we are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of no data to furni&s;h any hints for &s;olving the phenomena, and con&s;equently nothing to give ri&s;e even to a conjecture of a fir&s;t cau&s;e pro|ducing and directing the cour&s;e of the univer&s;e.</P>
<P>Do not the&s;e things then contain any evidence of the exi&s;tence and go|vernment of a Supreme Being?' Yes, verily, they contain and exhibit &s;ub|lime le&s;&s;ons, but how &s;hall we benefit by them without revelation? Put the works of Sir I&s;aac Newton into the
<PB N="13" REF="035413_0012_1004C122F63B4D00">hands of a man who cannot read, of what u&s;e are they to him? But let him be taught to read and in&s;tructed in the nature and de&s;ign of the&s;e works, and he may come to under|&s;tand the greate&s;t di&s;coveries of that great philo&s;opher. So let a man learn from revelation, either traditional or written, the exi&s;tence, character, or conduct of God, and all the works of nature will &s;peak to him a very in|telligible language. To him "The heavens will declare the glory of God, and the firmament &s;hew forth his handy work,"</P>
<Q><L>"For ever &s;inging as they &s;hine,</L>
<L>The hand that made us is Divine."</L></Q>
<P><PB N="14" REF="035413_0013_1004C0E8DAF6AA08">
There is another &s;ource of informa|tion&mdash;Te&s;timony.&mdash;But the te&s;timony of other men, who have only the &s;ame means of acquiring knowledge which we our&s;elves po&s;&s;e&s;s, though it may differ in degree mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity be the &s;ame in kind with our own ob&s;ervations or rea&s;onings, and for the rea&s;ons alrea|dy a&s;&s;igned can never lead us a &s;tep near|er to the di&s;covery of a fir&s;t cau&s;e.</P>
<P>But it is &s;aid, that the mo&s;t &s;avage nations which have yet been di&s;cover|ed, have always had among them &s;ome ideas of a God or Gods, and &s;ome notions of religious wor&s;hip, however ab&s;urd the&s;e may be, which &s;hews that mankind po&s;&s;e&s;s the knowledge of a
<PB N="15" REF="035413_0014_1004C12484C5E0C8">Deity without having ever heard of revelation.</P>
<P>The premi&s;es are true, but the con|clu&s;ion does not &s;eem fairly drawn, but quite the rever&s;e. It would rather appear that they had heard of reve|lation, and that the knowledge and religion which they po&s;&s;e&s;s, however corrupted in their progre&s;s, mu&s;t have originally flowed from that &s;ource, and that it mu&s;t have been a very gene|ral cau&s;e which has produced an ef|fect &s;o very exten&s;ive as to &s;hew it&s;elf in all nations.&mdash;By the by, this cir|cum&s;tance &s;eems to &s;hew that it was probably not the re&s;ult of deep philo|&s;ophical re&s;earch among the&s;e nations.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="035413_0015_1004C0EC242743A8">
It &s;hews likewi&s;e that at &s;ome time revelation was known to all mankind, and that in their various migrations this knowledge accompanied them, though corrupted by various people in various ways, and therefore traces of it are to be found in all nations in one form or another. Thus it appears, that the knowledge of a Deity, with|out the intervention of revelation, mu&s;t always have remained totally undi&s;co|verable by man.</P>
<P>Not only the knowledge of a Deity mu&s;t have been unattainable without revelation, but what mu&s;t have been the &s;ituation of man with re&s;pect to principles of moral rectitude? It has
<PB N="17" REF="035413_0016_1004C1260F0E3B98">been &s;aid that moral principles ari&s;e from the fitne&s;s of things. What is this fitne&s;s of things? or how came we by the knowledge of it? By reve|lation only: and it may &s;afely be a&s;|&s;erted that no good moral principles have ever been e&s;tabli&s;hed, but what have been drawn from this &s;ource.</P>
<P>Even tho&s;e who di&s;card revelation, have in part availed them&s;elves of it in the formation of their &s;y&s;tems of morality; but how vague and uncer|tain are they! without a &s;olid founda|tion, without energy, without &s;anction, except the hopes or fears of pre&s;ent good or evil; and how in&s;ufficient to
<PB N="18" REF="035413_0017_1004C0EF6D2DAC80">check the conduct, in circum&s;tances where detection is not feared!</P>
<P>But what human wi&s;dom could ne|ver have reached, revelation unfolds with the utmo&s;t ea&s;e and &s;implicity.</P>
<P><HI>In the beginning God created the hea|vens and the earth.</HI> This &s;hort pro|po&s;ition &s;hews us at once the exi&s;tence, the power, the wi&s;dom, and the good|ne&s;s of God; and in the amplification of his character in the &s;acred &s;criptures, Creation is &s;poken of as exhibiting his almighty power, with &s;uch &s;ublimity as &s;hines, even under all the di&s;advan|tages of a tran&s;lation, with unrivalled &s;plendor. Gen. i. 3. <HI>God &s;aid, Let there be light, and there was light.</HI> I&s;a|iah
<PB N="19" REF="035413_0018_1004C128821825E8">xlv. 7. <HI>I form the light and create darkne&s;s.</HI> Ver&s;e 12. <HI>I have made the earth, and created man upon it, I, even my hands have stretched out the heavens, and all their host have I commanded.</HI> Ch. xliv. 24. <HI>I am the Lord that mak|eth all things, that stretcheth forth the heavens alone, that &s;preadeth abroad the earth by my&s;elf.</HI> Ch. xlviii. 13. <HI>Mine hand al&s;o hath laid the foundations of the earth, and my right hand hath &s;pan|ned the heavens.</HI> Ch. xlii. 5. <HI>Thus &s;aith God the Lord, he that created the heavens and stretched them out, he that &s;pread forth the earth and that which cometh out of it: he that giveth breath
<PB N="20" REF="035413_0019_1004C0F0F67A03B0">to the people upon it, and &s;pirit to them that walk therein.</HI></P>
<P>His infinite wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s are &s;et forth with equal dignity and &s;ubli|mity in the &s;acred records.&mdash;His moral character is unfolded with great &s;im|plicity in the 34^t^h chapter of Exodus, ver&s;es 6 and 7^t^h. <HI>The Lord, the Lord God, merciful and gracious, long-&s;uffer|ing and abundant in goodne&s;s and truth. Keeping mercy for thou&s;ands, forgiving iniquity and tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion and &s;in, and that in clearing will not clear the guilty. Vi&s;iting the iniquities of the fathers upon the children unto the third and to the fourth generation</HI> (chap. xx. 5, 6.) <HI>of them that hate me, and &s;hewing mercy
<PB N="21" REF="035413_0020_1004C12AE622A648">unto thou&s;ands</HI> (of generations) <HI>of them that love me and keep my commandments.</HI></P>
<P>Thus we &s;ee the exi&s;tence of God is clearly exhibited in the &s;cripture, and his character manife&s;ted with &s;uch &s;implicity and per&s;picuity, that every per&s;on, even of the meane&s;t capacity, is fully competent to the knowledge of it; and the &s;imple reader of the word of God acquires with the utmo&s;t ea&s;e, a better grounded, and more unequi|vocal knowledge of the exi&s;tence and character of the True God, than all the boa&s;ted di&s;coveries of dei&s;tical phi|lo&s;ophers have ever pretended to.</P>
<P>In the &s;criptures we find the pure&s;t principles of morality flowing from a
<PB N="22" REF="035413_0021_1004C0F2CAC819F0">&s;ource fully adequate to the production of &s;uch principles,&mdash;the will of God, and that expre&s;&s;ed, not with the am|biguity of heathen oracles, or the far|fetched, often uncertain conclu&s;ions of philo&s;ophical deduction, but with the utmo&s;t preci&s;ion and di&s;tinctne&s;s, that he who runs may read, and &s;anctioned not only with the hopes and fears of pre&s;ent good or evil, but with the cer|tainty of future rewards and puni&s;h|ments, flowing from a tribunal where mi&s;takes, deceptions, and inju&s;tice are ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible. Where it is im|po&s;&s;ible that the good &s;hould mi&s;s the reward of their goodne&s;s, and equally impo&s;&s;ible for the wicked to e&s;cape the ju&s;t puni&s;hment of their wickedne&s;s.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER II.</HEAD>
<P>AS I am per&s;uaded that re|velation is the &s;ource of all the mo&s;t valuable knowledge we po&s;&s;e&s;s, and that it furni&s;hes the only data for &s;olving the phenomena in the moral world, let us try what accounts we can find of the di&s;&s;emination of reve|lation among mankind.</P>
<P>When we read the three fir&s;t chap|ters of Gene&s;is, we learn, not only that God created the heavens and the earth,
<PB N="24" REF="035413_0023_1004C0F61BEB6278">but that he al&s;o created all their inha|bitants: and when the earth was co|vered with vegetables and peopled with animals, and the &s;eas and waters &s;tored with fi&s;hes, and the air with winged inhabitants; as the la&s;t and mo&s;t dig|nified of his works, God formed man of the du&s;t of the ground, and breath|ed into his no&s;trils the breath of life, and man became a living &s;oul: that he created them male and female, ble&s;&s;ed them, and gave them dominion over the earth, and all its productions and inhabitants.</P>
<P>In this &s;tate man was familiar with revelation. God talked with him, and gave him a law for the regulation of
<PB N="25" REF="035413_0024_1004C12E00DE2330">his conduct, and connected with the breach of it the puni&s;hment of death. What would have been the &s;ituation of the human race if Adam had con|tinued in his obedience, may be con|jectured, but not di&s;tinctly a&s;certained.</P>
<P>He did not continue, however, to keep the law which was given to him, and the threatened penalty, <HI>Dying, thou &s;halt die,</HI> came into operation. Death began its operation, and continued it until he returned to the du&s;t from whence he was taken. His di&s;obe|dience placed him in a &s;ituation very different from that in which he was created, but did not deprive him of revelation, of which he now &s;tood in
<PB N="26" REF="035413_0025_1004C0F96596AA58">more need than in his former &s;tate; and accordingly we find that immedi|ately &s;ub&s;equent to his fall, revelation was renewed to him with &s;ome peculi|arities.</P>
<P>The di&s;cipline under which he was now to be placed was &s;hewn to him: it was announced to him that the &s;eed of the woman was to overcome the &s;erpent. Sacrifice al&s;o &s;eems to have been in&s;tituted and explained, and hence Abel offered a &s;acrifice in faith; and from the circum&s;tance of Cain and Abel both offering their <HI>first-fruits,</HI> we may conclude that many things were revealed, and many in&s;titutions e&s;ta|bli&s;hed, which were afterwards incor|porated
<PB N="27" REF="035413_0026_1004C1306933E9A0">in the laws and ordinances re|corded by Mo&s;es. We find al&s;o in the in&s;tructions given to Noah, that the di&s;tinction between clean and unclean bea&s;ts had been e&s;tabli&s;hed, for it is mentioned to him as a thing well known.</P>
<P>That the knowledge of the true God was pre&s;erved, and its influence under&s;tood, we learn from various cir|cum&s;tances between the creation and the flood of Noah: thus Enoch is &s;aid to have <HI>walked with God.</HI> No expla|nation is given; hence it would &s;eem that none was needed, there was no difficulty in under&s;tanding what <HI>walk|ing with God</HI> meant. The rea&s;on why
<PB N="28" REF="035413_0027_1004C0FAEF4D19B0">the flood was &s;ent to de&s;troy man from the face of the earth, was, <HI>becau&s;e the wickedne&s;s of man was great.&mdash;All fle&s;h had corrupted his way.</HI> Men being wicked and corrupting their ways, ne|ce&s;&s;arily implies the knowledge of a law for directing their conduct; be|cau&s;e it is di&s;obedience to a known law which con&s;titutes wickedne&s;s or cor|ruption. The depravity of mankind was become &s;o very general, that Noah only was found righteous before God in that generation. He was a preacher of righteou&s;ne&s;s; and God's &s;peaking to him is &s;poken of in &s;uch a way, as intimates that &s;uch communications had
<PB N="29" REF="035413_0028_1004C132D68F2198">not been uncommon, and therefore not &s;urpri&s;ing.</P>
<P>The &s;ame hi&s;tory informs us, that according to the threatening, the flood came, and &s;wept away the whole hu|man race, excepting only Noah and his family. He, by the direction of God, had prepared an ark, wherein his family and pairs of all the animal creation were pre&s;erved, and by them the earth was repeopled after the flood.</P>
<P>Noah, after the de&s;cent of his fami|ly from the ark, offered a &s;acrifice to the Lord of all clean animals, (an ex|tra number of which had been pre|&s;erved with him) hence we learn, that the knowledge and practice of &s;acrifice,
<PB N="30" REF="035413_0029_1004C0FD6D317D10">and all its relatives, was pre&s;erved, and prepared for being di&s;&s;eminated among all the po&s;terity of Noah: and that the true import thereof was under&s;tood and properly attended to, appears from God having accepted the &s;acrifice.</P>
<P>It has been urged that there was no writing in tho&s;e days, and therefore revelation mu&s;t have been very imper|fectly known.&mdash;Admitting that there was no writing, (which is by no means certain) this remark is very ea&s;ily ob|viated by ob&s;erving the great longevity of the people of tho&s;e times.</P>
<P>Adam lived for many centuries after his po&s;terity were multiplied on the earth, being above nine hundred years
<PB N="31" REF="035413_0030_1004C1345FA374F0">old when he died, by which time Me|thu&s;elah had opportunity to conver&s;e with him for above two hundred years, and Noah had opportunity for above two hundred years to conver&s;e with Methu&s;elah, which afforded ample time for Noah to acquire a complete know|ledge of all that had been revealed from the creation till the flood: his children al&s;o at that time had enjoyed the conver&s;ation of the antediluvians for about one hundred years, and Noah him&s;elf lived with them three hundred years after the flood, which gave him &s;ufficient time to in&s;truct his po&s;terity thoroughly in the knowledge of the character and will of God.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="035413_0031_1004C100D478E7E0">
Noah lived till the days of Abra|ham, and Shem lived till I&s;aac was well advanced in years&mdash;indeed Jacob was forty-eight years of age when Shem died. So that the&s;e living chro|nicles might well convey the traditions of revelation to their po&s;terity, who for &s;o many centuries had opportunity of learning from their mouths, the great works and words of God which they had witne&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>For &s;ome time after the flood, man|kind <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> to have lived in the &s;ame country, for perhaps a whole century, to the days of Peleg, in who&s;e days the earth is &s;aid to have been divided. Gen. x. 25. About this time it &s;eems
<PB N="33" REF="035413_0032_1004C1371949D8B0">likely the &s;cheme of building a city and a tower or temple to the heavens, was formed, and they &s;et to work with it in the land of Shinar, when God confounded their language, that they &s;hould not under&s;tand one another's &s;peech.</P>
<P>Hutchin&s;on remarks, from the for|mation of the Hebrew words, that the confu&s;ion which took place and cau&s;ed their di&s;per&s;ion, was not a difference of language; but as they had by this time departed from the &s;imple wor&s;hip of the true God, to wor&s;hip the hea|vens, their tower was intended to be dedicated, as a general temple, to the wor&s;hip of the heavens. The confu|&s;ion
<PB N="34" REF="035413_0033_1004C1041F2943B0">was, &s;uch a di&s;agreement about the objects and manner of wor&s;hip, that they &s;eparated from one another, as has often happened &s;ince; and as they divided the earth among them, they carried with them the knowledge of the true God, mixed with the vari|ous corruptions and innovations which they had &s;o early introduced. Thus, while the traditions of the knowledge and wor&s;hip of the true God were &s;pread over the world, corruptions and innovations were gradually introduced, till they changed the glory of the in|corruptible God into images made like to corruptible things: and becau&s;e they did not like to retain God in their
<PB N="35" REF="035413_0034_1004C13A769B4750">knowledge, he gave them up to the lu&s;ts of their own hearts. See Rom. i. 21, to end. And hence came the vile, degraded and corrupted &s;tate of the traditions of revelation, which have gradually &s;unk and degraded nations to the &s;avage &s;tate, in which many of them now are, and from which others are but lately and in part emerged.</P>
<P>But this was a work of time, and progre&s;&s;ive evil. In the early ages the knowledge of God, and even commu|nications from him, were not uncom|mon, even in tho&s;e nations who had already in part ob&s;cured the light of divine revelation: as in Egypt, Gen. xi. 17, 18, 19. in Sodom, Gen. xiv.
<PB N="36" REF="035413_0035_1004C105AA076258">22. in Gerar, Gen. xx. 3&mdash;7 and 26, 28. in Syria, Gen. xxxi. 24. Many other in&s;tances might be brought, that the knowledge of the character and laws of the true God were not obli|terated at once; but in a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of ages became &s;o ob&s;cure, as to be no longer di&s;tinctly di&s;cernible; and that not till after the Mo&s;t High had &s;epa|rated the &s;eed of Jacob for him&s;elf, and &s;et up his tabernacle among them, to be a light to the &s;urrounding na|tions.</P>
<P>From this view it will be ea&s;y to perceive, that whatever has been found good and true in religion and morals, among the nations of the earth who
<PB N="37" REF="035413_0036_1004C13EA5BFCD98">have not the knowledge of the written word among them, are &s;hining frag|ments of that glorious light, which &s;hone in its primitive &s;plendor among their more remote ance&s;tors.</P>
<P>When we con&s;ider the character of God, as delineated in the &s;acred ora|cles, and the manner in which his at|tributes are exemplified, unfolding by degrees, new and amiable, and inte|re&s;ting views of his perfections, are we not ready to conclude, that Good|ne&s;s is, if we may &s;o expre&s;s it, the leading characteri&s;tic? and when we view him as a <HI>Creator,</HI> who has made provi&s;ion for, and given life to &s;o many millions of creatures of various cla&s;&s;es,
<PB N="38" REF="035413_0037_1004C1075E4F75E0">does it not forcibly &s;trike us, that his goodne&s;s is manife&s;ted in communicating happine&s;s to all the works of his hands?</P>
<P>The irrational animals are directed to their proper good by in&s;tinct, which &s;eldom or never mi&s;leads them: this is the law of their nature, and they are generally ob&s;ervant of it. To man, the chief of his works in this world, he has al&s;o given rules for his conduct, rea&s;on to enable him to judge, and le&s;t he &s;hould &s;till err, the precepts and injunctions are illu&s;trated by examples: the principles and hopes exhibited in the &s;acred records, are adapted for his guidance by infinite wi&s;dom and infi|nite goodne&s;s.</P>

<P>THE nece&s;&s;ity of revelation need not be proved, it being impo&s;&s;i|ble that man could acquire the know|ledge of the exi&s;tence and character of God, or di&s;cover proper principles of moral rectitude without it. It is equally needle&s;s to prove that revelation has been given; the ideas of the exi&s;tence, and the wor&s;hip of a Deity, and the knowledge of moral good and evil,
<PB N="40" REF="035413_0039_1004C10A14DAA750">unattainable without it, being to be found in &s;ome degree in all nations.</P>
<P>Various collections of writings have claimed the honour of being the reve|lation of God. The compari&s;on has been made, and after the &s;tricte&s;t exa|mination, the &s;criptures of the Old and New Te&s;taments &s;tand unrivalled in their claim to that character.</P>
<P>The truth and authenticity of the Old Te&s;tament has evidences, &s;uch as appear amply &s;ufficient to &s;atisfy the mo&s;t &s;crupulous inquirer.</P>
<P>The law was given from mount Si|nai, in the &s;ight and hearing of the whole people of I&s;rael without excep|tion. They had been all witne&s;&s;es of
<PB N="41" REF="035413_0040_1004C142A3B0BBE8">the mighty works whereby God had brought them out of Egypt. They had all &s;een the &s;ea divided, and eve|ry one had pa&s;&s;ed through the &s;ea on dry ground, while the waters &s;tood up as a wall on each &s;ide. They had wit|ne&s;&s;ed the de&s;truction of the Egyptians, by the &s;ea returning to his channel. They had been conducted in the day by a pillar of cloud, and by night the &s;plendor of a pillar of fire had directed their movements: and now, when the whole nation was a&s;&s;embled, in expecta|tion of a public di&s;play of the Divine pre|&s;ence, they &s;aw the awful manife&s;tation; and all the individuals in the whole nati|on were made to hear the words of God,
<PB N="42" REF="035413_0041_10049A45921B25A8">proclaiming in the mo&s;t unequivocal language, his exi&s;tence, the relation in which he &s;tood to them, and that glo|rious law which they ought to keep.</P>
<P>Here was no ambiguity, the words were explicit, and not only all heard, but every individual under&s;tood them; and that all di&s;pute of what the law was, might be precluded, it was writ|ten by God him&s;elf on two tables of &s;tone, and the cu&s;tody of it publicly committed to a whole tribe, in the pre|&s;ence of all the people. And that the knowledge of it might continue uni|ver&s;al among them, and the practice of the precepts con&s;tant, every man was commanded, not only to have a
<PB N="43" REF="035413_0042_1004C14542FCC928">copy of the whole law, but to write it al&s;o on the mo&s;t public places, on the po&s;ts of his hou&s;e and on his gates, that it might become the &s;ubject of in|quiry to their children, and that every man might be qualified to explain the rea&s;ons of the in&s;titutions to &s;ucceeding generations.</P>
<P>Their being conducted through the wilderne&s;s, and placed in the land which God had promi&s;ed, was &s;uch a proof of the Divine veracity as left no room for doubt to enter. The declarations of God, that he would ble&s;s them if they kept his laws, and would puni&s;h them if they were di&s;obedient, have been mo&s;t accurately accompli&s;hed, as
<PB N="44" REF="035413_0043_1004C10EE9F48638">is corroborated by the hi&s;tory of other nations: and their di&s;per&s;ion at this day, according to the predictions in the &s;cripture, is &s;uch a living witne&s;s to the truth of the&s;e &s;criptures, as ne|ver was exhibited by any other nation. So accurately indeed have the predic|tions of the prophets been verified, that tho&s;e who di&s;puted the Divine authority of the &s;criptures, finding no other way to evade the force of their evidence, have contended, that the books were written after the events took place; but this allegation was rendered null, by the knowledge, that before &s;everal of the&s;e events took place, the &s;acred books were tran&s;lated
<PB N="45" REF="035413_0044_1004C147A7DF2F10">into Greek, and copies multiplied in many parts of the world.</P>
<P>That a man, or a few men, may be them&s;elves deceived, or that they may impo&s;e upon others, may be true; but in this ca&s;e a whole nation are the wit|ne&s;&s;es, and in ca&s;es where the te&s;ti|mony confe&s;&s;edly militates again&s;t their own characters; and their very exi&s;t|ence in their pre&s;ent &s;tate confirms it, and the whole exhibits &s;uch a weight of evidence, as &s;eems to &s;et at defiance even incredulity it&s;elf.</P>
<P>So very careful were the Jews of their &s;acred books, that it is &s;aid they counted not only the books and divi|&s;ions, but even the letters them&s;elves,
<PB N="46" REF="035413_0045_1004C111580BDE58">and carefully noted down not only their relative po&s;itions, but even their nume|rical order in the &s;horter divi&s;ions, that they might guard again&s;t the &s;malle&s;t alteration.</P>
<P>This, it will be &s;aid, was a &s;uper|&s;titious veneration for the letter of their &s;acred books, while they neglect|ed the &s;pirit of them.&mdash;Be it &s;o.&mdash;It has, however, proved one of the means which have brought down the Hebrew Text of the Old Te&s;tament to our times, in &s;uch purity, that in the col|lation of many hundreds of the mo&s;t ancient MS copies which could be &s;ound, there is not ob&s;erved a varia|tion which alters the &s;ignification of a
<PB N="47" REF="035413_0046_1004C149321DF4C0">law, a prophecy, or a doctrine; and when compared with the Septuagint tran&s;lation, which was made above two thou&s;and years ago, that is, before the coming of Chri&s;t, there is a won|derful harmony and coincidence be|tween them. So that we may &s;afely rely on the integrity of the parts, as well as upon the evidence of the whole.</P>
<P>The authority of the Old Te&s;tament being e&s;tabli&s;hed, forms a ba&s;is for that of the New. The fir&s;t promi&s;e of vic|tory to be obtained by the &s;eed of the woman, was gradually amplified in the Old Te&s;tament, and thus formed a foundation for the faith of the anci|ents, who, under&s;tanding the import
<PB N="48" REF="035413_0047_1004C114A89F8170">of the &s;ymbolical in&s;titutions, looked-forward to the promi&s;ed Deliverer. God promi&s;ed to Abraham, that in his &s;eed all the families of the earth &s;hould be ble&s;&s;ed, when his wife had been barren till her ninetieth year, and pa&s;t all hopes of being a mother. The promi&s;e ran in the line of I&s;aac, and of I&s;aac's &s;ons Jacob had the promi&s;e: and among the twelve &s;ons of Jacob, it was foretold that the Me&s;&s;iah &s;hould be a de&s;cendant of Judah, in whom (as the name imports) the prai&s;e of Jehovah &s;hould be manife&s;ted. And the la&s;t predictions of Jacob, Gen. xlix. 8&mdash;12. and of Mo&s;es, Deut. xxxiii. 7. had evident reference to this.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="035413_0048_1004C14AECC37900">
After David was called to be king, the promi&s;e was renewed to him; to which he refers, 2 Sam. xxiii. 1&mdash;5. In &s;ub&s;equent times, the prophets fre|quently &s;poke of the coming of the Glorious Holy One, particularly the &s;eraphic I&s;aiah, vide ch. iv. and chap|ters xi. and xii. ch. xxxii. al&s;o ch. xxxv. ch. xl. ch. xlii. ch. xlix. ch. lii. ch. liii. and indeed the greater part of the whole book: and all the prophets, as many as have &s;poken, have likewi&s;e foretold concerning him. In the pro|phecy of Daniel, the particular time is &s;pecified when the Me&s;&s;iah &s;hould come, being four hundred and ninety years after the going forth of the com|mandment
<PB N="50" REF="035413_0049_1004C14D56005EB8">to re&s;tore and build Jeru&s;a|lem, which was at that time de&s;olate, but the &s;eventy years of her captivity were near a clo&s;e.</P>
<P>The coming of John the Bapti&s;t, as the voice of one crying in the wilder|ne&s;s, was likewi&s;e foretold, I&s;aiah xl. 3. and in Malachi 3 and 1. and in both in&s;tances connected with the coming of the Me&s;&s;iah.</P>
<P>That there was &s;uch a per&s;on as Je|&s;us Chri&s;t, is acknowledged by dei&s;ts, Jews and Mahometans, and that he came at the time which the Chri&s;tian Scriptures declare. The Koran ac|knowledges, that he was a prophet

<P>That he was the promi&s;ed Me&s;&s;iah, appears by the predictions of the pro|phets being verified in him. He came at the appointed time, when the gene|ral expectations of the people were &s;o rai&s;ed, that when John appeared it was a que&s;tion, whether he were the Chri&s;t or not.</P>
<P>In him were fulfilled the prophecies: I&s;aiah vii. 14. compared with Matth. i. 22, 23. <HI>Now all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was &s;poken of the Lord by the prophet, &s;aying, Behold, a virgin &s;hall be with child, and &s;hall bring forth a &s;on, and they &s;hall call

<P>WITH regard to the apo&s;|tles, the preachers of Je&s;us Chri&s;t: they were either them&s;elves deceived by an impo&s;tor, and became dupes to his de&s;igns; or they were them&s;elves impo&s;tors, and meant to make man|kind &s;ub&s;ervient to their de&s;igns; or the were &s;o thoroughly convinced of the truth of the doctrines which they preached, and &s;o &s;trongly impre&s;&s;ed with a conviction of the importance
<PB N="61" REF="035413_0060_1004C1A0819618F0">of their truths, that they were willing to &s;uffer the lo&s;s of all things, and even of life it&s;elf, rather than fail in communicating this knowledge, &s;o im|portant to all mankind.</P>
<P>All the impo&s;tors who&s;e hi&s;tory has reached us, have been per&s;ons who&s;e real views and de&s;igns were very dif|ferent from what they avowed as their intentions, and their cunning &s;uperior to that of tho&s;e whom they made &s;ub|&s;ervient to their purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>The acqui&s;ition of power, riches, or fame, or all three, have been their ultimate objects; and their deceptions have been practi&s;ed for obtaining the&s;e ends. It was nece&s;&s;ary that they &s;hould
<PB N="62" REF="035413_0061_1004C16025076E60">hold out to their followers &s;omething particularly alluring, to be enjoyed ex|clu&s;ively by them, thereby to induce them to a&s;&s;i&s;t in the pro&s;ecution of their &s;chemes, with that enthu&s;ia&s;tic energy which is mo&s;t likely to en&s;ure &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>The character of Je&s;us Chri&s;t was &s;o very different from all this, that even the dei&s;ts them&s;elves have not commonly imputed impo&s;ture to him.</P>
<P>He always declared his de&s;igns to be the happine&s;s, not of any particular nation, but of all mankind; and that he was to accompli&s;h this end by lead|ing them to the knowledge of the true God, and the practice of moral holi|ne&s;s:

<P>He declared that he was &s;ent of God, not to do his own will, but to &s;peak the words and do the works of his Father, and accordingly he &s;hewed forth the power of God in the mira|cles which he performed and the doc|trines he taught. He healed the &s;ick,
<PB N="64" REF="035413_0063_1004C161F492E0A8">made the lame to walk, the deaf to hear, the blind to &s;ee.

<P>Whil&s;t in his own conduct he exhi|bited a character of &s;potle&s;s purity and patient &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, he did not flatter his di&s;ciples with promi&s;es of exemp|tion from evil, or of exclu&s;ive enjoy|ments; but carefully in&s;tructed them, that the happine&s;s which he promi&s;ed was de&s;igned for all mankind, as well as for them; and they under&s;tood it &s;o: that he de&s;igned to make them &s;er|vants, to proclaim his go&s;pel to the world: and that in the cour&s;e of this
<PB N="66" REF="035413_0065_1004C164AB599C48">&s;ervice, they would be expo&s;ed to all manner of injuries, per&s;ecutions, the hatred of all nations, and death it&s;elf, without any earthly privileges.</P>
<P>From this &s;light view of the &s;ubject, it evidently appears, that Je&s;us was not and could not po&s;&s;ibly be an impo&s;tor; and therefore his di&s;ciples were not de|ceived, but fairly and hone&s;tly in&s;truct|ed in what they were to expect; and they found the predictions verified.</P>
<P>There was as little chance that they them&s;elves &s;hould be impo&s;tors. The nature of their doctrine, which was peace and good-will to men, was op|po&s;ite to impo&s;ture of any kind. They were men capable of under&s;tanding the
<PB N="67" REF="035413_0066_1004C1A726AA3180">in&s;tructions which they had received: they had &s;een their ma&s;ter uniform in his conduct and te&s;timony: they had &s;een him confirm it by his blood: and he who&s;e name was ca&s;t out as the ex|ecration of the rulers and people of his own nation, was not by any means adapted to become the hero of an im|po&s;ture, and that too in the very city where he was known and crucified. They profe&s;&s;ed to be &s;ent by the pow|er of God, to te&s;tify his re&s;urrection from the dead to the very people who had murdered him, and to preach &s;al|vation through his name as the only Saviour; and this te&s;timony was con|firmed by &s;uch &s;triking and inconte&s;ti|ble
<PB N="68" REF="035413_0067_1004C16716217760">miracles, that even their enemies were con&s;trained to acknowledge their reality and force. They taught the &s;ame doctrines, and inculcated the &s;ame practice which their Ma&s;ter had taught and exemplified in their pre&s;ence: and like him, they arrogated nothing of di&s;covery or of power to them&s;elves, but uniformly te&s;tified that they had no claim to merit of any kind, and that the doctrines which they taught, the miracles which they performed, were not their own, but exhibitions of the power, wi&s;dom, and love of God, ma|nife&s;ted through Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the one mediator between God and men. At the &s;ame time, their intrepidity in te&s;ti|fying
<PB N="69" REF="035413_0068_1004C1A98F5B1B48">the &s;ublime truths they were charged to preach, in the face of all oppo&s;ition; their patient enduring eve|ry injury to which they were &s;ubject|ed, and even &s;ealing their te&s;timony with their lives, &s;hewed that they count|ed nothing too great to do or to &s;uffer for Chri&s;t's &s;ake. They counted no|thing dear or precious to them, but what contributed to promulgate and enforce the precious and important truths, which they had in charge to communicate to mankind. The only concern which they had about them|&s;elves was, that they might fulfil the mini&s;try which they had received of the Lord, and that they might confirm and
<PB N="70" REF="035413_0069_1004C1697B1BF540">corroborate it by holy and unblamable lives, animated by their conviction of the truth, and by tho&s;e precious hopes, which they con&s;idered them&s;elves as po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing in common with all who re|ceived and kept their te&s;timony.</P>
<P>Thus it appears, that the character and conduct of the apo&s;tles of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, were in every re&s;pect the very rever&s;e of impo&s;ture. That having re|nounced the hidden things of di&s;ho|ne&s;ty, not walking in craftine&s;s, nor handling the word of God deceitfully, they commend them&s;elves to the con|&s;cience of every hone&s;t man, as hone&s;t witne&s;&s;es of the truth which they them|&s;elves believed.</P>

The apo&s;tles of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, fully in&s;tructed by their ma&s;ter, directed by the &s;pirit of God, and endued with the capacity of &s;peaking in various lan|guages, and the power of working mi|racles in atte&s;tation of their divine mi&s;|&s;ion, were properly qualified to preach the go&s;pel to all mankind: and accord|ingly they began at Jeru&s;alem on the day of penteco&s;t, about &s;even weeks after the re&s;urrection of Je&s;us, at a time when there was a great a&s;&s;embly of people from various nations pre&s;ent, who were a&s;toni&s;hed to hear the won|derful works of God declared in the languages of all the nations from which they had come, and this by a few men
<PB N="72" REF="035413_0071_1004C16B0B8EB5B0">who were known to be illiterate Gali|leans: and when inquiry was made, <HI>What meaneth this?</HI> and others &s;coffing &s;aid they were drunken, Peter &s;tand|ing up with the eleven, &s;hewed the peo|ple that this was the fulfilment of the prophecy of Joel; and what they now &s;aw and heard, was the re&s;ult and proof of Je&s;us of Nazareth, whom they had crucified, being rai&s;ed up and &s;eat|ed at the right hand of God, as the Saviour of mankind; and exhorted them to repent and be baptized in the name of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, for the remi&s;&s;ion of their &s;ins. This was the fir&s;t public te&s;timony of the apo&s;tles, and the ef|fect was the conver&s;ion of about three
<PB N="73" REF="035413_0072_1004C1AFDF68E0D8">thou&s;and in one day. The &s;ub&s;equent miracles by which the divinity of their mi&s;&s;ion was authenticated, were of &s;uch a nature, and exhibited in &s;uch public and unequivocal in&s;tances, in the pre|&s;ence of their enemies, as evidently &s;hewed that deception or collu&s;ion were impo&s;&s;ible; in&s;omuch that the rulers of the Jews who had murdered Je&s;us Chri&s;t, finding his re&s;urrection and &s;ub|&s;equent power and glory, witne&s;&s;ed by &s;uch inconte&s;tible evidence, knew not what &s;teps to take for the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of his doctrine.

<P>It will readily occur to our reflection, that miracles never were intended for the proof of any moral propo&s;ition or doctrine, but for the confirmation of the facts which the apo&s;tles te&s;tified, viz. the re&s;urrection of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and the dignity and power with which he was inve&s;ted, and the authority whereby the called all men every where to repent, and proclaimed for|givene&s;s of &s;in, and &s;alvation to all who believed and obeyed the go&s;pel.</P>
<P>That the books of the &s;acred &s;crip|ture were written by the men who&s;e names they bear, has been admitted in
<PB N="75" REF="035413_0074_1004C1B248B17E90">all ages, with at lea&s;t as much evidence as that the works of any of the anci|ents were written by the authors to whom they are a&s;cribed.

<P>Be&s;ides the &s;ketches already given, there is another &s;ource of evidence, called the internal evidence of Chri&s;ti|anity, that is, the evidence which ari&s;es from the &s;ublimity of the di&s;coveries, and the originality and purity of the morality contained in the &s;acred writ|ings,

<P>ON looking into the Bible, the very fir&s;t thing that &s;trikes our at|tention, is a di&s;covery of the being and attributes of God. Gen. i. 1. <HI>In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.</HI> This meets us on the thre&s;h|old of our inquiry, and claims our fir&s;t attention.</P>
<P>As we have already &s;een that human rea&s;on and philo&s;ophy, una&s;&s;i&s;ted by revelation, are incapable of di&s;cover|ing
<PB N="79" REF="035413_0078_1004C1B588BCC548">the character, or even the exit|ence of a Deity, let us inquire what account the &s;cripture has given of his character, his de&s;igns, his conduct, and the rea&s;ons of it.</P>
<P>He is repre&s;ented as infinite in pow|er: indeed the creation of the heavens and the earth evidently intimate this. <HI>He &s;pake and it was done, he command|ed and it stood fast.</HI> P&s;. xxxiii. 6&mdash;9. He claims this character to him&s;elf, Gen. xvii. 1. <HI>I am the Almighty God.</HI> Exod. vi. 3. <HI>I appeared unto Abraham, unto I&s;aac, and unto Jacob, by the name of God Almighty.</HI> It is not nece&s;&s;ary to multiply in&s;tances of the a&s;cription of infinite power to him: they occur
<PB N="80" REF="035413_0079_1004C174C5A2B7F0">through the whole of the &s;cripture, and his works confirm it beyond any room for doubt.</P>
<P>His wi&s;dom is infinite. Prov. iii. 19. <HI>The Lord by wi&s;dom hath founded the earth, by understanding hath he esta|bli&s;hed the heavens.</HI> Job xxviii. 20, 23. <HI>Whence then cometh wi&s;dom, and where is the place of understanding? God un|derstandeth the way thereof, and he knoweth the place thereof.</HI> His wi&s;dom is manife&s;ted in all his works. <HI>It is high as heaven, deeper than hell, longer than the earth, and broader than the &s;ea.</HI> Job xi. 8, 9. His knowledge and under&s;tanding are repre&s;ented as di|recting and &s;uperintending the exer|tions
<PB N="81" REF="035413_0080_1004C1B7ED9D94F0">of his power in all circum&s;tances, and in every place at the &s;ame time, through every the mo&s;t minute part of his creation, &s;o that not a hair can fall to the ground without his cognizance. Hence he is repre&s;ented as pre&s;ent eve|ry where, &s;uperintending or controlling every thing or event. The thoughts of the heart are naked and open be|fore him; perfectly under&s;tanding all our thoughts, words and actions, and all their con&s;equences, even the mo&s;t remote, and prepared to direct, re&s;train, or check them, that they cannot ulti|mately defeat or impair the accompli&s;h|ment of his own purpo&s;es.</P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="035413_0081_1004C17A58B58BD8">
It is impo&s;&s;ible that any &s;ecret can elude his omni&s;ience, or that to his pre&s;cience any thing can be contingent. Pa&s;t, pre&s;ent, and future, are perfect|ly under his immediate in&s;pection, with a per&s;picuity and accuracy ab&s;olutely inconceivable to the mo&s;t exalted cre|ated intelligence. His operations and &s;uperintendence, extend from the mo&s;t minute atom or its qualities to the utmo&s;t po&s;&s;ible exten&s;ion of the univer&s;e; while his immutable exi&s;tence and eternity of duration, preclude the &s;malle&s;t po&s;&s;i|bility of error in his government and conduct.</P>
<P>The intere&s;ting point of view in which we are taught to con&s;ider the
<PB N="83" REF="035413_0082_1004C1BA569B5E68">Supreme Being, is that relative mani|fe&s;tation of his character, de&s;igns, and conduct, which more immediately re|&s;pects mankind: and hence, in what has been called his <HI>moral</HI> character or attributes, we are led more particular|ly to ob&s;erve this relation to our &s;tate and pro&s;pects, which naturally &s;ugge&s;ts the <HI>state of man</HI> as a &s;ubject of con&s;i|deration, which may be briefly &s;tated in this place, and further di&s;cu&s;&s;ed in the cour&s;e of our inquiries.</P>
<P>Revelation directs our views to the creation of man in a &s;tate of happine&s;s, &s;ubject to a law with a capacity of obey|ing it, and probably, of improvement in felicity. He was commanded to keep
<PB N="84" REF="035413_0083_1004C17E88E66D58">this law, and threatened with death as the con&s;equence of di&s;obedience. He di&s;obeyed and became &s;ubject to death; and all his po&s;terity have been and are &s;ubject to death, as well as him&s;elf. The moral &s;tate of mankind appears greatly deranged; wickedne&s;s is dif|fu&s;ed over the world; and men, &s;o far from &s;eeking to be reconciled to God, became more and more e&s;tranged from him, &s;o that at length the knowledge of the true God became ob&s;cured among them through their wickedne&s;s: but &s;till the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of deficiency which they retained from the traditions of revelation, however ob&s;cured, led them to multiply fal&s;e gods to them|&s;elves,
<PB N="85" REF="035413_0084_1004C1BBE1911FD8">vainly &s;eeking from them relief from their con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of guilt. Ene|mies to God, and to one another, their di&s;obedience to him became the &s;ource of mi&s;ery to them&s;elves; and with &s;ome faint ideas of a future &s;tate of retribution, derived from the tradi|tions of revelation, they were de&s;titute of certainty, well grounded hope, or rational con&s;olation. With talents ca|pable of promoting the happine&s;s of of &s;ociety, they oppre&s;&s;ed one another by dome&s;tic di&s;cords and foreign wars; and the peace and comfort of families were de&s;troyed by the cunning or the pa&s;&s;ions of individuals: &s;o that in&s;tead of genuine amelioration of their moral
<PB N="86" REF="035413_0085_1004C180151431C8">&s;tate, their hopes were deceived by fal&s;e pro&s;pects; and deception only &s;moothed the &s;urface of things, whil&s;t numberle&s;s evils rankled under the de|lu&s;ive appearance of improvement.</P>
<P>Such a di&s;mal &s;ituation &s;tood in need of the cheering rays of revelation, to di&s;pel the gloom, and by exhibiting natural evils in the light of moral di&s;|cipline, to make them &s;ub&s;ervient to the be&s;t and mo&s;t important intere&s;ts of man. Hence &s;uch a di&s;play of the Di|vine character and conduct, as was adapted to the condition and nece&s;&s;i|ties of mankind, mu&s;t be peculiarly important and intere&s;ting: and accord|ingly we find in the Divine record, that
<PB N="87" REF="035413_0086_1004C1BD6D27A1A0">goodne&s;s is a leading feature in the Di|vine character.</P>
<P><HI>The Lord is good to all&punc; his tender mercies are over all his works. He mak|eth his &s;un to ri&s;e on the evil and on the good, and &s;endeth rain on the just and on the unjust.</HI></P>
<P>As goodne&s;s forms a leading feature in the Divine character, a little atten|tion will lead us to ob&s;erve the modi|fications of his goodne&s;s in every part of his conduct; and all his attributes are in the mo&s;t perfect harmony with it, and contribute to promote the ac|compli&s;hment of the plans of infinite wi&s;dom and infinite goodne&s;s, with in|finite power. Con&s;i&s;tently with this,

In the character which he a&s;&s;umes to him&s;elf, as before remarked, Mercy is the very fir&s;t attribute which meets our view: <HI>The Lord God, merciful and gracious.</HI> Exod. xxxiv. The condition of man, as having tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed the law of his God, admitted of no hope but from the mercy of God. In many ca&s;es, if a man has injured his neigh|bour he may have wherewith to make him adequate compen&s;ation, and thus repair the damage which he had occa|&s;ioned; but when man trangre&s;&s;es the law of God, what equivalent can he render to him? All that which he po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;es is the property and the gift of his maker; he can have nothing indepen|dent
<PB N="90" REF="035413_0089_1004C18439A8D958">of him to make compen&s;ation for his mi&s;conduct. Wherewith, then, &s;hall he come before the Lord? The an&s;wer is, <HI>Let the wicked for&s;ake his wickedne&s;s, and the unrighteous man his thoughts; let him return to the Lord who will have MERCY upon him, for our God will abundantly PARDON.</HI> Hence the <HI>Know|ledge of &s;alvation is by the remi&s;&s;ion of &s;ins, through the tender mercy of our God.</HI> Luke i. 77, 78. And indeed, through the whole of the &s;criptures, the mercy of God is exhibited as the foundation of man's confidence towards God.</P>
<P>The mercy of God, therefore, his forgiving &s;in, and freeing the repent|ing
<PB N="91" REF="035413_0090_1004C1C6119E73C8">&s;inner from the imputation of guilt, is celebrated in the Old and New Te&s;|taments as univer&s;al, and as enduring for ever: <HI>&s;hewing mercy unto thou&s;ands</HI> (of generations) <HI>of them that love him and keep his commandments.</HI> Exod. xx. 6.&mdash;<HI>His mercy is from generation to ge|neration unto them that fear him.</HI> Luke i. 50. <HI>He is merciful and gracious, long-&s;uffering, and abounding in goodne&s;s and truth.</HI> Exod. xxxiv.</P>
<P>Holine&s;s is one of the attributes of God, and in&s;eparable from his charac|ter and conduct. Holine&s;s &s;eems to be that perfect purity and freedom from any immoral &s;tain, which is totally in|compatible with any po&s;&s;ible error or
<PB N="92" REF="035413_0091_1004C186A4D6AA00">There is nothing in the Divine character or conduct that can have the &s;malle&s;t affinity to moral evil on his part, as its author or perpetra|tor; nor is it po&s;&s;ible that moral evil can be in any way plea&s;ing or accept|able to him. <HI>He is of purer eyes than to look on iniquity. The throne of ini|quity cannot have fellow&s;hip with him.</HI></P>
<P>Con&s;i&s;tently with this holine&s;s, his mercy is always exerci&s;ed. The wicked mu&s;t for&s;ake his wickedne&s;s before he can be pardoned: men mu&s;t be turned from darkne&s;s to light, from the pow|er of Satan unto God, before they can receive forgivene&s;s of &s;ins.&mdash;It is part of his character&mdash;<HI>Clearing he will not

<P>This al&s;o is a part of his goodne&s;s, for if men could even receive forgive|ne&s;s whil&s;t they continued in the career of wickedne&s;s, not only no moral ad|vantage would be derived from it, but men would be encouraged to continue and even increa&s;e in wickedne&s;s with|out re&s;traint, and both &s;ociety would be more injured, and the individual would be incapable of reaping any benefit from &s;uch pardon, and therefore its end
<PB N="94" REF="035413_0093_1004C18911743B30">would be defeated.&mdash;Hence he is repre|&s;ented as long-&s;uffering, and waiting that he may be gracious; that is, he has long patience with men, till the di&s;cipline and means which he employs, have the effect of humbling and mak|ing them &s;en&s;ible of their wickedne&s;s, and making them earne&s;tly &s;eek for|givene&s;s, that their hearts being turn|ed to him, like the &s;oftened wax, they may receive deep and indelible impre&s;|&s;ions of his gracious kindne&s;s; and thus a moral amelioration is effected in them.</P>
<P>God is repre&s;ented in the Scripture as inflexibly ju&s;t, invariably connecting vice with mi&s;ery as its nece&s;&s;ary con&s;e|quence and puni&s;hment, and continuing
<PB N="95" REF="035413_0094_1004C1CB2C5CBC38">and varying the cha&s;ti&s;ements with un|remitting attention, in order to produce the reformation of the vicious.

<P>AS the purpo&s;es of God have in view the happine&s;s of his creatures; as he de&s;igned that all men &s;hould be benefited by the di&s;pen&s;ations of his <HI>Goodne&s;s;</HI> be brought to know, to love, and to obey him, as e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary to the highe&s;t felicity of which their natures are capable; &s;o he has adapted his mea&s;ures for the accom|pli&s;hment of this benevolent end, with infinite wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s.</P>

He early announced to mankind that he would &s;end a Deliverer, intimating that from the woman &s;hould proceed one who &s;hould brui&s;e the &s;erpent's head, and that in the conflict the &s;er|pent &s;hould brui&s;e his heel. The in|&s;titution of &s;acrifice was at a very early period, and the whole of the ancient ritual was emblematical of the way of &s;alvation by Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>The character of Je&s;us Chri&s;t the Saviour, is a very important &s;ubject of con&s;ideration; as the right apprehen&s;i|on of this is connected with the know|ledge of the only true God, and leads to a &s;atisfactory under&s;tanding of the Divine economy.</P>

<P>From the&s;e and &s;imilar te&s;timonies it appears, that he was in a peculiar &s;en&s;e the only begotten of the Father, the fir&s;t being whom God brought into
<PB N="101" REF="035413_0100_1004C20BC06549B0">exi&s;tence (at what time is impo&s;&s;ible to be known) and the Agent by whom he created all things; and he is recog|ni&s;ed by his Father in that character. P&s;al. cii. 25. quoted by the apo&s;tle, Heb. i. 10. <HI>Thou, Lord, in the beginning hast laid the foundations of the earth, and the heavens are the works of thine hands.</HI></P>
<P>He is likewi&s;e repre&s;ented as <HI>Uphold|ing all things by the word of his power.</HI> Heb. i. 3. <HI>By him all things con&s;ist.</HI> Col. i. 17. Con&s;i&s;tent with this view he &s;eems to have manife&s;ted him&s;elf to Adam, Gen. iii. 9. to Noah, chap. vi. 7, 8, 9. to Abraham, I&s;aac, and Ja|cob, Gen. xii. 1, 3. and xvii. 1. and chap. xviii. ch. xxvi. 1, 5. ch. xxxii.

Hence we may conclude, that all things were un|der his direction and management, pre|vious to his coming in the form of a &s;ervant. From the&s;e te&s;timonies, which are &s;o very explicit, it would appear, that tho&s;e who deny the exi&s;tence of Je&s;us Chri&s;t previous to his coming in|to the world in the reign of Augu&s;tus, are mi&s;taken, as they are thereby re|duced to the nece&s;&s;ity, either of reject|ing con&s;iderable portions of the &s;crip|ture,
<PB N="103" REF="035413_0102_1004C20F0BFBF288">or of interpreting them in &s;ome way very different from what appears to be their mo&s;t obvious and natural &s;ignification: and while the &s;y&s;tem is pre&s;&s;ed with this difficulty which there &s;eems no way of avoiding, it does not contribute to give us more con&s;i&s;tent apprehen&s;ions of the character and con|duct of God, or of the &s;tate and pro|&s;pects of man.</P>
<P>The glorious dignity which Je&s;us Chri&s;t enjoyed before he took upon him the form of a &s;ervant, &s;hews us the &s;trength of his filial obedience, and his conde&s;cen&s;ion and love to man, when he who <HI>was RICH for our &s;akes became POOR, that we through his poverty might
<PB N="104" REF="035413_0103_1004C1D69596A450">become rich,</HI> and &s;hews us the greatne&s;s of the &s;acrifice which he made, when <HI>He emptied him&s;elf and made him&s;elf of no reputation, and became obedient even unto death,</HI> that he might &s;ave us from de&s;truction.</P>
<P>He came as the prophet had fore|told, as a root out of a dry ground, having no external dignity to make him an object of attention or de&s;ire. His whole deportment was mode&s;t, una&s;|&s;uming, the pattern of humility and the greate&s;t philanthropy; and though clothed with Divine power and autho|rity, as the prophet had declared. I&s;a|iah xi. 1, 5. the &s;pirit of the Lord re&s;ted on him, the &s;pirit of wi&s;dom and
<PB N="105" REF="035413_0104_1004C21174077928">under&s;tanding, the &s;pirit of coun&s;el and might, the &s;pirit of knowledge and the fear of the Lord; yet he a&s;&s;umed no dignity to him&s;elf, but uniformly de|clared him&s;elf to be the Son and Ser|vant of his God and Father, and that all the power belonged to his Father. And in the pro&s;ecution of the work which God had given him to do, he &s;ubmitted to poverty, contempt, &s;uffer|ing, and death, with perfect re&s;ignati|on to the will of his Father. He went about teaching and doing good. All his doctrines, his conduct, his miracles, &s;hewed the mo&s;t perfect love to God, and the mo&s;t unconquerable benevo|lence to men.</P>

Hence we are led to contemplate the character of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, not merely as the in&s;trument by whom the love of God was manife&s;ted to man, but al&s;o as an active voluntary agent in the great work, who loved mankind him&s;elf, and with a perfect under&s;tanding of all the evils and &s;ufferings to which &s;uch con|de&s;cen&s;ion would &s;ubject him, willingly offered him&s;elf for the purpo&s;e of re|conciling &s;inners unto God. Compare P&s;alm xl. 6, 7, 8, with Heb. x. 5. <HI>Sa|crifice and offering thou didst not de&s;ire: mine ears hast thou opened: burnt offer|ing and &s;in offering thou hast not requir|ed.

<P>In this view we are taught to con&s;i|der him as the agent by whom the Fa|ther exerci&s;es his &s;upreme authority; directing, controlling, or checking the

<P>Je&s;us Chri&s;t is repre&s;ented as the one Mediator between God and man. 1 Tim. ii. 5. We have no knowledge of any intercour&s;e between God and man, or between the Creator and his creatures, but what is conducted through the hands of a Mediator. <HI>No man knoweth the Father, &s;ave the Son,

<P>Hence he is called the Shepherd, who&s;e office is to gather in the &s;trayed &s;heep: and for this purpo&s;e, <HI>it plea&s;ed the Father that in him &s;hould all ful|ne&s;s dwell, that having made peace by the blood of his cro&s;s, by him to recon|cile all things to him&s;elf.</HI> Col. i. 19, 20.

Every thing is to be &s;ub|jected unto him, excepting only the Father who &s;ubjects them under him.

<P>Tho&s;e who by a patient continuance in well doing have approved them&s;elves his faithful &s;ervants, who have loved God, and made his law the rule of their conduct, will enter into the en|joyment of felicity; but tho&s;e who were contentious and would not obey the truth, will be placed under a more &s;evere cour&s;e of di&s;cipline, and effec|tually learn, that cha&s;ti&s;ement is the native con&s;equence of their per&s;ever|ance in wickedne&s;s. Even then the in|fliction of &s;ufferings will proceed on the invariable principle of benevolence, which applies various degrees of cha&s;|ti&s;ement

<P>Such appears to be the general out|line of the de&s;igns of God, to be ac|compli&s;hed by Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and this de&s;ign is invariably kept in view through all ages and di&s;pen&s;ations: and though individuals may, for a time, deprive

<HEAD>LETTER VII.</HEAD>
<P>THE dignity and the depra|vity of human nature, are themes which have been largely de&s;canted on, and doubtle&s;s human nature exhibits evi|dent &s;igns of both. Various conjec|tures and rea&s;onings have been attempt|ed to account for the&s;e appearances, by tracing them to their &s;ource.</P>
<P>Revelation a&s;&s;ures us, that God cre|ated all things by Je&s;us Chri&s;t; and there &s;eems good rea&s;on to conclude,
<PB N="118" REF="035413_0117_1004C1E7C4B8F048">that when his works came from his hand they mu&s;t have been very good, and of cour&s;e that &s;uch mu&s;t have been the &s;tate of man when he came from the hands of his Creator. How he came to be as he now is, has been long a &s;ubject of di&s;pute, and not yet &s;et|tled. It has been &s;uppo&s;ed, that every individual of mankind exi&s;ted in a for|mer &s;tate as moral agents, enjoying happine&s;s, and capable, by their conti|nued obedience to the law of their God, of continuing in felicity. That by the abu&s;e of their freedom they fell, though not all in equal degrees: that God was plea&s;ed to connect them with gro&s;&s;|er materials to prevent their de&s;truc|tion,
<PB N="119" REF="035413_0118_1004C224B5C58C78">and, placing them in Adam, to render them capable &s;ubjects of a cour&s;e of moral and phy&s;ical di&s;cipline, for their recovery to a &s;tate of moral ho|line&s;s and con&s;equent happine&s;s; a &s;y&s;|tem which he is carrying on under all the varieties of di&s;pen&s;ations which his wi&s;dom &s;ees proper, to induce them to attach them&s;elves to obedience and ho|line&s;s, as the objects of their deliberate choice, the rational re&s;ult of their own experience and conviction, and the on|ly way to the highe&s;t felivity of which their natures are capable. This &s;up|po&s;ition does not appear to be any way incon&s;i&s;tent either with &s;cripture, or what we ob&s;erve among mankind.
<PB N="120" REF="035413_0119_1004C1EA739A7EB8">When man was placed in Eden, it &s;eems pretty obvious that he was in a &s;ituation which needed re&s;traint, and he was put under one, and threatened with death as the con&s;equence of di&s;o|bedience. His Maker &s;aid, it was not good for man to be alone; he needed a help, and God made an help meet for him. The&s;e hints may intimate, that man was now placed in a &s;ituation where his propen&s;ity to evil was re|&s;trained, and death might not be nece&s;|&s;ary; but when he di&s;obeyed he broke through the re&s;traint, and a change in the mode of di&s;cipline became nece&s;&s;a|ry: the evil propen&s;ities formerly re|&s;trained were now loo&s;e, and it became
<PB N="121" REF="035413_0120_1004C2264476AF58">proper that he &s;hould be &s;ubjected to death. The &s;ituation to which Adam had now reduced him&s;elf became al&s;o the &s;tate of his po&s;terity: their pro|pen&s;ities were not under the re&s;traint of his former &s;tate, and it became equally proper that they &s;hould be &s;ubjected to the &s;ame di&s;cipline under which he was now placed.</P>
<P>It was now that their various di&s;po|&s;itions began to appear, and they &s;till appear in &s;uch diver&s;ity of mildne&s;s and ferocity, of candor and duplicity, of docility and ob&s;tinacy, of intelligence and &s;tupidity, as has afforded ample room for inquiry and di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, which &s;eem as far from &s;ettling the point as
<PB N="122" REF="035413_0121_1004C1EDC32BC480">at the beginning; therefore there does not appear any impropriety in a&s;&s;uming a &s;uppo&s;ition, which &s;eems at lea&s;t as likely to account for the&s;e appearances as any other.</P>
<P>Admitting then, that men in their former &s;tate had fallen, but not all to the &s;ame extent, we may conceive the&s;e various di&s;po&s;itions or propen&s;ities to re&s;ult from the different degrees of ma|lignity which they had acquired in their deviation from their original rectitude; and now that their propen&s;ities are broke loo&s;e from the re&s;traint under which man was placed in Eden, they &s;hew them&s;elves in the various appear|ances which human nature now exhi|bits.
<PB N="123" REF="035413_0122_1004C22991E29148">&mdash;It will not be a &s;ufficient an&s;wer, to &s;ay that the&s;e are the fruits of imi|tation; for it is yet to be &s;hewn what were the original patterns for this imi|tation: nor can we &s;ay that God plac|ed a pure &s;pirit in a contaminated body, which &s;hould pollute it with moral de|filement, for thus we &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e men morally wicked without any per|&s;onal agency of their own.</P>
<P>Another circum&s;tance offers it&s;elf to our attention. It will be admitted that &s;uffering is the effect of &s;in; but we know that infants are &s;ubject to various kinds and degrees of &s;uffering, and even to death, while they are yet in a &s;tate which appears incapable of tran&s;gre&s;&s;i|on.
<PB N="124" REF="035413_0123_1004C1F108272C68">Is there any other &s;uppo&s;ition which offers a more rational account of the cau&s;e of that &s;uffering, con&s;idered as a part of moral di&s;cipline?</P>
<P>But it will be &s;aid, that infants are incapable of di&s;cerning the relation be|tween the cau&s;e and the effect, and therefore are not proper &s;ubjects of moral di&s;cipline.&mdash;The fir&s;t is true, but it is a difficulty which pre&s;&s;es at lea&s;t as much on any other &s;uppo&s;ition, and therefore does not peculiarly invalidate what has been &s;uppo&s;ed above.

It is a fact that moral education may be, and &s;ometimes is, conducted in part at lea&s;t, by way of <HI>impre&s;&s;ion</HI> rather than <HI>rea&s;oning,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Dr. Ru&s;h's ingenious E&s;&s;ay on the Influence of Phy&s;ical Cau&s;es on the Moral Faculty.</NOTE> and however limited the power of man may be, it does not follow that it is not competent to the power of God, to make even the deli|rium of a fever, or continued in&s;anity, &s;ub&s;ervient to moral amelioration. In|deed a ca&s;e much in point occurs in the book of Daniel; it is the ca&s;e of Nebu|chadnezzar. When his heart was lift|ed up with pride, he was depo&s;ed, and deprived of his rea&s;on, in order to make him know and acknowledge that the
<PB N="126" REF="035413_0125_1004C1F293BBA2C0">Mo&s;t High God ruled. See Daniel iv. 24. to the end, and chap. v. 18&mdash;21. In this in&s;tance, it appears to have been the method which Divine wi&s;dom &s;aw meet to employ, for the very purpo&s;e of moral amelioration, and it an&s;wered the purpo&s;e for which it was u&s;ed.</P>
<P>In this ca&s;e however it may be &s;aid, that Nebuchadnezzar had his rea&s;on before, and when it was re&s;tored to him, he recollected and knew the cau&s;e and de&s;ign of his aba&s;ement. True, and if it can be &s;hewn that the pre&s;ent &s;tate of exi&s;tence is the only &s;tate of moral di&s;cipline, and that God cannot or will not re&s;tore to mankind, or even to tho&s;e who die in infancy, a perfect
<PB N="127" REF="035413_0126_1004C2310E8A9090">recollection and con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of all that they have been, done, or &s;uffered, this ca&s;e mu&s;t be given up; but that can|not be &s;hewn, the contrary is evident from &s;cripture. See among many other places, Matt. xxv. 34. to the end: &s;o that this mu&s;t be admitted to be a ca&s;e very much in point.</P>
<P>Indeed the idea has no novelty; it appears to have been general among the Jews in the days of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and was referred to in a que&s;tion which his own di&s;ciples put to him&s;elf; and he did not intimate to them that the notion was a wrong one, and he never failed to correct their &s;entiments when they were wrong.

The que&s;tion, <HI>Who did &s;in, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?</HI> and the an&s;wer of Je&s;us, <HI>Neither hath this man &s;inned nor his parents,</HI> appears to intimate, not that either of them were &s;inle&s;s, but that his being born blind was not the fruit of any particular &s;in.</P>
<P>Upon the whole then, this &s;uppo&s;i|tion does not appear to be any way in|con&s;i&s;tent with rea&s;on or &s;cripture, and may be &s;afely admitted, if it can be of u&s;e to &s;olve any of the phenomena of man.</P>
<P>Whatever we may &s;uppo&s;e to have been the previous &s;tate of man, reve|lation informs us that God formed him
<PB N="129" REF="035413_0128_1004C233741052C8">of the du&s;t of the ground, and breathed into him the breath of life, and man became a living &s;oul. His Maker taught him language, and made him acquaint|ed with tho&s;e things with which he was &s;urrounded; &s;o that he gave appo&s;ite names to all the bea&s;ts of the field, and the fowls of the air: and tho&s;e who contend that Hebrew was the language of Adam, &s;ay that the&s;e names are, in that language, de&s;criptive of the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hing characteri&s;tics of the re|&s;pective birds and bea&s;ts; which indi|cates that he was not only taught lan|guage, but al&s;o its proper application.</P>
<P>His having dominion over the whole animated creation, whether on the land
<PB N="130" REF="035413_0129_1004C1F688E538C0">or in the waters, implies that he mu&s;t not only have under&s;tood their natures, but al&s;o the treatment which was pro|per for them; and his being placed in the garden to dre&s;s and keep it, pre|&s;uppo&s;es that he was endued with uni|ver&s;al knowledge of the whole vegeta|ble world, and the various &s;oils and manures &s;uitable for the cultivation of the various cla&s;&s;es, genera and &s;pecies, as well as a thorough knowledge of the virtues and u&s;es of their re&s;pective productions, as food for him&s;elf and all the creatures under his dominion.</P>
<P>It &s;eems probable al&s;o that the ele|ments of the arts and &s;ciences were likewi&s;e communicated to him by his
<PB N="131" REF="035413_0130_1004C235335622B8">munificent Creator. The knowledge of hu&s;bandry and agriculture &s;eem to have been coeval with Adam, the &s;ci|ence of mu&s;ic was known, the harp and the organ were employed in his days; which implies an acquaintance with mathematical and mechanical &s;cience. Metallurgy was under&s;tood, which pre|&s;uppo&s;es a knowledge of chemi&s;try; and &s;cientific in&s;truction given to the artificers in bra&s;s and iron, which indi|cates an acquaintance with the arts and &s;ciences in the days of Adam, little thought of by philo&s;ophers and di&s;co|verers in modern days, who do not ad|vert to the dignified extent of mind be|&s;towed on our progenitor.</P>
<P><PB N="132" REF="035413_0131_1004C1F8ED96BB08">
With re&s;pect to the moral &s;tate of Adam, it was no le&s;s exalted. God made man upright, Eccl. vii. 29. He was made the capable &s;ubject of a law; in&s;tructed in the knowledge of life, the knowledge of good and evil, with their re&s;pective con&s;equences; and provided with a &s;uitable and amiable companion to give occa&s;ion for and encouragement to the practice of the &s;ocial virtues; to &s;hare his labours and to increa&s;e his fe|licity by friendly participation and &s;oci|al intercour&s;e. Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the friend|&s;hip, and honoured with the vi&s;its of his Divine Benefactor, whom he al&s;o daily contemplated in his works, and whom he always plea&s;ed by his con|duct,
<PB N="133" REF="035413_0132_1004C237A727AA98">while he continued obedient to his law; his dignified &s;tate mu&s;t have been &s;uch as we can have but very im|perfect ideas of from the hints given by Mo&s;es.</P>
<P>But Adam in his be&s;t e&s;tate was of the earth, earthy; he was not a &s;pi|ritual, but a <HI>&s;ouli&s;h</HI> man. The &s;crip|tures repre&s;ent man as con&s;i&s;ting of bo|dy, &s;oul, and &s;pirit, as in 1 The&s;&s;. v. 23. and Heb. iv. 12. The &s;oul may be that faculty by which we can appre|hend, contemplate, and enjoy rational plea&s;ure, or &s;uffer pain from this mate|rial &s;y&s;tem in which we live; and the &s;pirit that by which we can have inter|cour&s;e with, and enjoy happine&s;s from
<PB N="134" REF="035413_0133_1004C1FA78CC3110">&s;piritual and Divine objects. Hence, 1 Cor. ii. 14, 15. the natural, or <HI>&s;oul|i&s;h,</HI> man receiveth not the things of the &s;pirit of God&mdash;becau&s;e they are &s;pirit|ually di&s;cerned; and therefore tho&s;e who&s;e highe&s;t wi&s;dom (James iii. 15.) is earthly or <HI>&s;ouli&s;h,</HI> cannot know them, and hence too the natural or <HI>&s;ouli&s;h</HI> body, 1 Cor. xv. 44. &s;eems to be a body adapted to the material &s;y&s;tem in which we now live, and the &s;piritual body adapted to the &s;piritual &s;tate in which the righteous will be placed after the re&s;urrection. Therefore the fir&s;t Adam was made a living &s;oul; the la&s;t Adam a quickening &s;pirit.</P>
<P><PB N="135" REF="035413_0134_1004C23A12583E48">
Adam being a <HI>&s;ouli&s;h</HI> man, of the earth, earthy, ver&s;e 47. was only capa|ble of &s;ouli&s;h attainments and enjoy|ments. The &s;pirit, which in Prov. xx. 27. is &s;tyled the candle of the Lord, was in him probably as a lamp not lighted; and it is likely he could not be capable of &s;piritual ideas in the &s;tate in which he then was, at lea&s;t not in that early &s;tage of it which only was accompli&s;hed before he fell. His fall, which is briefly &s;tated by Mo&s;es, made death a nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence to him|&s;elf and his po&s;terity; and from the concurrent te&s;timony of &s;cripture, it becomes a beneficial con&s;equence to man, for mankind are now, as Adam
<PB N="136" REF="035413_0135_1004C1FC29350AB0">was, <HI>&s;ouli&s;h,</HI> and can never be com|pletely freed from that &s;tate but by death: till then they mu&s;t in &s;ome de|gree bear the image of the fir&s;t Adam, in&s;omuch that the Apo&s;tle, 1 Cor. xv. 44. &s;ays, that at death the body is &s;own a natural or &s;ouli&s;h body. Now Je&s;us Chri&s;t is the quickening &s;pirit, who&s;e word and &s;pirit quickens the &s;pi|rits of the children of men, that they may bear his image, (ver&s;e 49.) and the change which this quickening pro|duces, is &s;poken of as regeneration, 1 Pet. i. 13. New Birth, John iii. 3. 1 Pet. i. 23. Eph. ii. 1, 5. and many other figures, where the change is &s;poken of as begun but not completed:
<PB N="137" REF="035413_0136_1004C23B9D808168">and death appears an important &s;tep in the Divine economy, for completely di&s;&s;olving the connection with the fir&s;t Adam, that the image of the &s;econd may be perfected.</P>
<P>In the &s;ame point of view may all the di&s;tre&s;&s;es and afflictions of mankind, with propriety be con&s;idered as valua|ble and important parts of moral di&s;ci|pline, made nece&s;&s;ary by &s;in, and ap|plied by infinite wi&s;dom and benevo|lence for the purpo&s;e of producing mo|ral good. We may form &s;ome idea of the propriety of this, by con&s;idering the importance of medicines to a di&s;|ea&s;ed body; or &s;urgical operations, &s;uch as the drawing of a tooth, or the am|putation
<PB N="138" REF="035413_0137_10049A4C42577CC0">of a limb, which though ex|tremely painful, are performed with a benevolent intention, and often with a beneficial effect. There is this differ|ence however, that though men often fail in accompli&s;hing their de&s;igns; it is impo&s;&s;ible that the purpo&s;es of God can be ultimately fru&s;trated.</P>
<P>It has often happened, that from a mi&s;taken view of the phy&s;ical evils to which individuals and &s;ocieties are &s;ub|ject, arguments have been &s;tarted again&s;t the government of God, and objections brought again&s;t the &s;criptures; where|as a proper view of the &s;ubject is a vin|dication of the Divine government, and an irrefragable proof of the Divine ori|gin
<PB N="139" REF="035413_0138_1004C23D5D9326D8">of the &s;criptures, where alone can be found a rational explanation of ob|vious facts, which without revelation mu&s;t have forever remained in&s;crutable.</P>
<P>When we con&s;ider this &s;ubject it will be a very obvious and ju&s;t reflection, that all mankind are &s;inners, for all without exception are under this di&s;ci|pline: and from the &s;cope of the whole &s;criptures, it would &s;eem to be the de&s;ign of God to recover all mankind to holine&s;s and con&s;equent happine&s;s. This appears to be the uniform object of all the Divine di&s;pen&s;ations in every age and &s;tate, and will continue to be the object of all the di&s;pen&s;ations of God towards man in every future &s;tate,
<PB N="140" REF="035413_0139_1004C202ED651030">till the whole &s;hall be &s;aved, and not one lo&s;t.</P>
<P>If we mi&s;s this idea, it is owing to our taking partial views of the &s;crip|tures and of the Divine economy, which will naturally lead to mi&s;taken appre|hen&s;ions of the purpo&s;es of God, and the de&s;igns of his di&s;pen&s;ations. This has been a fruitful &s;ource of doubts and di&s;putations among tho&s;e profe&s;&s;ing Chri&s;tianity; and many, who would not take the trouble of judging for them&s;elves, have turned with di&s;gu&s;t from the di&s;cordant interpretations &s;o frequently offered, and rejected the &s;criptures altogether, without inquiry, as unintelligible or contradictory.</P>
<P><PB N="141" REF="035413_0140_1004C24138D8CF88">
If we inquire into the evidence of this doctrine, it will be natural to re|flect, that as infinite power, wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s are e&s;&s;ential to the character of God, we might rationally &s;uppo&s;e, that when he brought intelligent beings into exi&s;tence, his de&s;ign was to make them good and happy; becau&s;e we have no ground on which to conclude, that any de&s;ign or work of the Supreme Being could po&s;&s;ibly be incon&s;i&s;tent with infinite goodne&s;s. Hence we may fair|ly conclude, that the de&s;igns of infinite benevolence could be nothing &s;hort of the highe&s;t felicity of which his crea|tures were capable. The contrary &s;up|po&s;ition would picture to us a character
<PB N="142" REF="035413_0141_1004C20478C66C80">the very rever&s;e of Him who is <HI>good to all.</HI>&mdash;Hence the declarations, that all the families of the earth &s;hall be ble&s;&s;ed in the &s;eed of Abraham: that his pur|po&s;e is to reunite all under Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the one head; to reconcile all things by Je&s;us Chri&s;t to him&s;elf: that he will have all men to be &s;aved, and to come to the knowledge of the truth. Hence it appears, that the exi&s;tence of moral evil makes phy&s;ical evils nece&s;&s;ary, as a part of moral di&s;cipline: and the univer&s;al extent of the latter forms a deci&s;ive proof of the univer&s;ally bene|volent de&s;igns of God, and of the un|cea&s;ing progre&s;s of his means for the accompli&s;hment of the&s;e de&s;igns.</P>
<P><PB N="143" REF="035413_0142_1004C24486742920">
This view of the &s;ubject, while it embraces the &s;cope of revelation, fur|ni&s;hes a &s;trong evidence of its truth and Divine origin, by exhibiting to us a con&s;i&s;tent, a con&s;olatory, and glorious pro&s;pect, unattainable from any &s;ource but revelation alone.</P>
<P>As all who admit the truth of the &s;criptures, agree that the de&s;ign of God, in that revelation, was to reco|ver men from &s;in to holine&s;s, and from mi&s;ery to happine&s;s, it is of great im|portance to con&s;ider the means which he employs to accompli&s;h this purpo&s;e; which will lead to a more particular view of the di&s;pen&s;ations of God, and the pre&s;ent and future &s;tate of man.
<PB N="144" REF="035413_0143_1004C206E5AA7C90">But as the &s;ubject, even a &s;light &s;ketch of it, is too exten&s;ive for my pre&s;ent avocations, I mu&s;t leave it for the pre|&s;ent, and intend to re&s;ume it when I have more lei&s;ure.</P>
