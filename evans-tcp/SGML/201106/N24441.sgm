<HEAD>THE CONFESSION AND Dying Speech of Peter Porcupine, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>I WAS born in Old England; my grand|father was a day labourer. He died before I was born; but I often &s;lept beneath the &s;ame roof that &s;heltered him, and where his widow dwelt for &s;everal years after his death. It was a little thatched cottage with a garden before the door. Here I and my brothers went every Chri&s;tmas and Whit&s;untide to &s;pend a week or two, and <HI>torment</HI> the poor old woman with our noi&s;e and <HI>dilapidations.</HI> Such was my propen&s;ity to vice, that I could not re&s;i&s;t the temptation to <HI>pilfer</HI> even from my grandmother. In this I di&s;covered a ba&s;ene&s;s and a depravity which rogues di&s;avow; for they make it a point of honour not to &s;teal from each other. My grand|father was no philo&s;opher&mdash;alas! it would have been well for me if he had been; for then his
<PB N="4" REF="032353_0003_0FF1EEDBE5062E10">precepts as well as examples would have in&s;tilled principles into my mind, which would have pre&s;erved me from the ignominous fate I am about to &s;uffer. The legacies he left, were a large bundle of fal&s;e keys, a pair of pi&s;tols, a dagger and a ma&s;que&mdash;The fal&s;e keys he u&s;ed to open locks with, which were not his own&mdash; the pi&s;tols were employed to &s;upport him&s;elf with on the highway&mdash;the dagger to put an enemy or a &s;u&s;pected friend <HI>&s;lily</HI> out of the way, and the ma&s;que to keep him&s;elf from being known when he was engaged in any of his diurnal or nocturnal avocations.</P>
<P>My father when I was born, was of the pro|fe&s;&s;ion of my grandfather&mdash;The reader will ea&s;ily believe, from the pur&s;uits of his parents, that he received no very brilliant education: he was however very <HI>ingenious</HI> for a man in his rank of life&mdash;When a little boy, he u&s;ed to pilfer from other boys their chuckers, their marbles, and their tops, and the&s;e his earnings were appropriated to the expences of fini&s;hing an education which he had begun under a &s;et of &s;harpers, who held their nocturnal revels in a tavern in the neighbourhood. What the&s;e men could be expected to teach, he had learnt, and had be&s;ides con&s;iderably improved him&s;elf in
<PB N="5" REF="032353_0004_0FF1EEDDB0139630">&s;everal other branches of the <HI>pad.</HI> He under|&s;tood &s;hop-lifting, pocket-picking, and &s;everal other branches of &s;imilar &s;ciences well, and was often cho&s;en to draw plans for &s;ucce&s;sful burg|lary; in &s;hort, he had the reputation among his kindred fellows, of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing experience, cun|ning, and dexterity, which never fails in <HI>England</HI> to give a man weight with tho&s;e of his own profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>So much for my ance&s;tors: from whom, if I derive no honour, I have, alas! inherited a halter.</P>
<P>I had, and I hope I yet have, three brothers&mdash; the elde&s;t is a highwayman, the &s;econd a pick|pocket, and the younge&s;t, if alive, is in the &s;ervice of a &s;et of money coiners. I was born on the ninth of March, 1766. The exact age of my brothers I have forgotten; but I remem|ber having heard my mother &s;ay, that there was but three years and three quarters difference between the ages of the olde&s;t and that of the younge&s;t.</P>
<P>A father like ours, it will be readily &s;uppo&s;|ed, did not &s;uffer us to eat the bread of idle|ne&s;s. I do not remember the time when I did not earn my living. My fir&s;t occupation was
<PB N="6" REF="032353_0005_0FF1EEDF745402E8">in &s;tealing <HI>potatoes, turnips</HI> and <HI>peas</HI> from the neighbours. When I fir&s;t trudged a field with my &s;mall bag and rum bottle &s;wung over my &s;houlders, I was hardly able to climb the gates and &s;tiles, and at the clo&s;e of the day to reach home, was a ta&s;k of infinite difficulty. My next employment was &s;tealing <HI>fowls, gee&s;e, tur|keys</HI> and <HI>ducks. Picking pockets</HI> followed, and hence I arrived at the honour of joining a gang of burglars. My natural <HI>cowardice</HI> prevented me from taking to the highway. We were all of us liars and rogues, and my father u&s;ed to boa&s;t that he had four boys, of whom the elde&s;t was but fifteen years old, who did as much work as any three <HI>pick pockets</HI> in the pari&s;h of Farn|ham.</P>
<P>It would u&s;ele&s;s and unentertaining to dwell on the rogueries of a country boy; to lead the reader through gardens and fields, into hen-roo&s;ts and hog&s;tyes, where I fir&s;t gave &s;peci|mens of my &s;kill; I &s;hall, therefore, come at once to the epoch, that gave that turn to my future life, which at la&s;t brought me to the United States and to the gibbet.</P>
<P>It was on the &s;ixth of May 1783, that I &s;al|lied forth to &s;eek new adventures. I was dre&s;&s;ed
<PB N="7" REF="032353_0006_0FF1EEE1561CEB50">in a &s;uit of clothes, which had been purloined by one of my father's companions, in order to accompany two or three dames from a common &s;tew to a fair; but in&s;tead of going to the fair, I tricked the la&s;&s;es and went to London. In this metropolis I amu&s;ed my&s;elf in <HI>picking pockets</HI> and <HI>&s;hop lifting,</HI> till I enli&s;ted early in the year 1784, and as peace had then taken place, no great ha&s;te was made to &s;end recruits off to their regiments. The lei&s;ure time I had after my enli&s;tment was &s;pent in acquiring as much knowledge as would aid me in the &s;ucce&s;sful pur&s;uits of getting money without labour, and in the cour&s;e of one year which I devoted to it I learnt more than I had ever done before. My ambition excited in me a wi&s;h to be a leader among my brethren of the long fingered tribe, and unle&s;s I had more learning and more inge|nuity than any of them, I could not hope to be &s;ucce&s;sful. This ambition prompted me to de|vote all my lei&s;ure to books, and being natu|rally acute, I laid the foundation of that know|ledge and tho&s;e talents, which I have &s;ince my arrival here, faithfully devoted to the &s;ervice of the king, my ma&s;ter. Before my departure for Nova Scotia I was promoted to the rank of a corporal. We &s;et &s;ail from Grave&s;end, and after a &s;hort pa&s;&s;age arrived at Halifax in Nova
<PB N="8" REF="032353_0007_0FF1EEE79B6E0C88">Scotia. We &s;taid but a few weeks in Nova Scotia, being ordered to St. John's and New Brun&s;wick. Here and at other places we re|mained till the month of September 1791, when the regiment was relieved and &s;ent home. During my &s;tay, however, in the new World, I again pur&s;ued the drift of my genius and in|clination and pilfered wherever opportunity offered. The captain of the company to which I belonged had &s;ome hand&s;ome &s;hirts to which I took a longing, and borrowed a few of them for my own u&s;e. In this I was detected, tried by a court martial, &s;entenced to receive five hundred la&s;hes well laid on, and to be deprived of the rank of corporal. The &s;entence was inflicted with the utmo&s;t rigor, and &s;o &s;evere was the operation that I fainted away at the halberts after receiving about half of the puni&s;hment. The remainder of the &s;entence was delayed for a few days, and then was doubly &s;evere as my back had not recovered from the preceding operation. This will ac|count for the large &s;ears which I now have on my back. This treatment for &s;o trifling an offence as that of borrowing a few &s;hirts, de|termined me to take my leave of the regiment as &s;oon as we returned to Old England. We landed at Portsmouth on the third of Novem|ber,
<PB N="9" REF="032353_0008_0FF1EEEDE71C63E0">and on the nineteenth of the next month I <HI>de&s;erted,</HI> after having &s;erved not quite eight years.</P>
<P>London was my object and to that I ha&s;ten|ed, and here I gave a full &s;cope to my propen|&s;ities. The &s;econd day after my arrival I picked the pocket of a gentleman of five guineas. A few nights after I a&s;&s;ociated my&s;elf with a &s;et of <HI>burglars,</HI> and we broke open a &s;hop in Cheap&s;ide and robbed it of fifty guineas worth of goods and about ten guineas in ca&s;h. My next attempt was on the hou&s;e of a banker, in company with a notorious villain named <HI>Jack Tryall.</HI> We &s;ucceeded and robbed the banker of five hundred guineas. This la&s;t robbery occa&s;ioned con&s;iderable alarm, and as a large reward was offered for our apprehen&s;ion, I de|termined to take my leave of old England for a time and went to France in March 1792. Paris opened a new field to me, there I intended to exert all my ingenuity; but in this pro&s;pect I was &s;uddenly di&s;appointed; for on my arrival at Calais, not having money enough for the journey, I &s;allied out one evening, and un|luckily picked the pocket of one of the officers of the police. Unfortunately I was detected in the fact, apprehended, taken before one of
<PB N="10" REF="032353_0009_0FF1EEEFD3EB3E40">the tribunals, and &s;entenced to be whipped a la mode militaire. The old wounds in my back were made to bleed afre&s;h by the&s;e cut-throats, and revolutioni&s;ts. Had not the government been changed and purged of its former ini|quites I &s;hould have e&s;caped &s;o &s;evere a pu|ni&s;hment; but to be arre&s;ted in the fir&s;t &s;tep was what I could not, nor ever will forgive. This reception made me change my determina|tion, and in&s;tead of going to Paris, I went in|to the country. I boarded at a farm hou&s;e, and &s;upported my&s;elf by <HI>dilapidations</HI> from the neigh|bours. In the neighbourhood were I lived, there lived an Abbe, who had formerly re&s;ided in England, where he acquired &s;ome know|ledge of the Engli&s;h language. With him I &s;oon became acquainted, and it was from him that I acquired my knowledge of the French language. I &s;oon di&s;covered in him a kindred &s;pirit, and we early commenced a partner&s;hip, and &s;upported our&s;elves genteely at the expence of the neighbourhood. After our friend&s;hip was confirmed he informed me, that he was obliged to fly from England for being concern|ed in counterfeiting guineas and forging bank|notes. My friend the Abbe and my&s;elf pa&s;&s;ed our days very happily together in this innocent neighbourhood for near &s;ix months, till at
<PB N="11" REF="032353_0010_0FF1EE99DD8A7830">length it began to be &s;u&s;pected and whi&s;pered that we were the authors of the robberies of which mo&s;t of them complained. Having al|ready &s;marted under the la&s;h of tho&s;e cur&s;ed &s;ans culottes, and cut-throats, and fearing a detection that might expo&s;e me to a &s;imilar and perhaps a wor&s;e fate, I &s;uddenly took my leave and went to <HI>Havre de Grace.</HI> Here I employed my&s;elf in my u&s;ual occupation till I &s;craped to|gether money enough to defray my expences to America, for which I determined to embark. I took a pa&s;&s;age to New York and landed there in the month of October 1792.</P>
<P>I have now brought my&s;elf to the United States. Alas! it would have been well for me if I had never &s;et foot in any country of liberty and equality! Being without money I determin|ed to obtain a &s;upport in my cu&s;tomary way, and broke open a &s;tore in William &s;treet, out of which I got &s;ome ca&s;h and &s;ome fine goods. I had, in the &s;hort time I remained in that city, acquired &s;ufficient information to know that this mode of employment would not &s;erve me long; that I would &s;oon be detected, and my race would &s;oon be at an end. The money I acquired by the robbery in William &s;treet ena|bled me to take &s;tage for Philadelphia. Here
<PB N="12" REF="032353_0011_0FF1EF07EE3911A0">I remained for a &s;hort time and then went to Wilmington. At this la&s;t place I determined to avail my&s;elf of my knowledge of the French language for a &s;upport, and became a teacher. The little encouragement I met with, affording but a &s;canty &s;ub&s;i&s;tance, I left Wilmington and returned to this city. Here I began to teach the French language, to tran&s;late French into Engli&s;h, and now and then to &s;cribble a para|graph for <HI>the Gazette of the United States.</HI></P>
<P>In the month of July, 1794, Dr. PRIESTLY landed at New-York. Knowing that the per|&s;ecution of the Briti&s;h government drove him to this country, and knowing at the &s;ame time that this would furni&s;h me with an opportunity to panegyrize that government and traduce him, and thereby attract the attention of his Britannic maje&s;ty's agents here, and aware that PITT paid well for &s;ervices rendered him, I wrote a pamphlet entitled <Q>Ob&s;ervations on the Emigration of Dr. JOSEPH PRIESTLY.</Q> No circum&s;tance of my life afflicts me more than this. In this pamphlet I indulged the ran|cour of a heart too much devoted to vice, and libelled a philo&s;opher and a friend to human nature, the recollection of which embitters my la&s;t moments. I abominated his principles be|cau&s;e
<PB N="13" REF="032353_0012_0FF1EF09B9A61268">they were favourable to liberty, and every thing like liberty or republicani&s;m, I held in dete&s;tation from the moment I had a judgment of my own. An affection for my king was drawn in with my mother's milk, and I have ever cheri&s;hed a love for monarchy with as much zeal as I did a hatred for liberty. Pov|erty and inclination thus &s;timulating me I hoi&s;t|ed the bloody flag again&s;t Dr. PRIESTLY. The Ob&s;ervations, as I expected, excited the atten|tion of one of his maje&s;ty's agents. He &s;oon found me out, and we &s;oon under&s;tood each other. He told me that the Briti&s;h cau&s;e was langui&s;hing in this country, and that &s;ome ef|forts mu&s;t be &s;peedily made or it would be lo&s;t forever. He ob&s;erved further, that the admi|ni&s;tration was well di&s;po&s;ed towards Great Bri|tain, and had a &s;ecret dete&s;tation of France &s;ince the revolution commenced&mdash;that a dread of the people only, who were intoxicated with the French Revolution and the Rights of Man, re|&s;trained them from &s;howing their affection for the one and abhorrence of the other&mdash;that the admini&s;tration had an aver&s;ion from republican doctrines and principles, and were endeavour|ing &s;ecretly though &s;urely to a&s;&s;imilate the go|vernment to that of Great Britain.&mdash;To effect objects &s;o de&s;irable and &s;o important to his ma|je&s;ty
<PB N="14" REF="032353_0013_0FF1EF114DA247B8">and his cau&s;e, it was nece&s;&s;ary to alienate the people from France and &s;ubdue their pre|judices again&s;t the mother country.&mdash;He con|ceived that I had talents which might be &s;uc|ce&s;sfully employed to this end&mdash;that I had given an evidence of my capacity in the Ob&s;ervations, and that he would furni&s;h materials if I would put them into form. He further remarked with a &s;mile, that I had a talent at <HI>mi&s;repre|&s;entation</HI> and <HI>fabrication,</HI> which appeared to him original, and would, if well managed, produce great effects upon the minds of the people. Flattered by the&s;e civilities and &s;trongly impre&s;|&s;ed with a de&s;ire to &s;erve my king in whatever country I might be &s;ituated, and willing to abandon a mode of life which was attended with &s;o much ri&s;que, I enli&s;ted again in the &s;ervice of my &s;overeign. Five hundred guineas a year was to be my &s;alary, and if &s;ucce&s;s attended my pur&s;uits, the &s;um was to be increa&s;ed. We parted, and he told me at parting, that he would con&s;ult &s;ome of his friends in the government, obtain their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and in a few days I &s;hould hear from him again. In a few days I received a packet from him by a confidential friend of his, containing materials, out of which I form|ed my "Bone to gnaw for Democrats," and bank notes to the amount of five hundred dol|lars.
<PB N="15" REF="032353_0014_0FF1EF16F679C918">The bone to gnaw was &s;oon ready for the pre&s;s. It is not nece&s;&s;ary here to tell the reader how faithfully I improved the hints which were given me at the interview with his maje&s;ty's agent. The five hundred dollars &s;eemed to have had an influence in brightening my genius of which I thought it un&s;u&s;ceptible. Fal&s;hood of the mo&s;t flagrant nature, a&s;&s;erted with the utmo&s;t confidence, and glo&s;&s;ed over as &s;peciou&s;ly as po&s;&s;ible con&s;tituted the e&s;&s;ence of my fir&s;t e&s;&s;ay. In a few days after the pub|lication the agent again called upon me, ex|pre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf well &s;atisfied, and &s;aid he would &s;upply me with further materials&mdash;that a cer|tain Secretary had promi&s;ed him an ample &s;tock. He was faithful to his promi&s;e, for in a few days I received a large packet, out of which I formed <HI>the &s;econd part of the Bone to Gnaw, Plain Engli&s;h, New Year's Gift, Pro&s;pect from the Con|gre&s;s Gallery,</HI> and a number of paragraphs for the <HI>Gazette of the United States</HI>&mdash;As I mean not to implicate a brother of the type, I will not mention the conver&s;ation with the agent rela|tive to the la&s;t mentioned Gazette.</P>
<P>My productions began to excite attention. The agent paid me a third vi&s;it, and &s;ugge&s;ted the propriety of coming forth from my ob|&s;curity.
<PB N="16" REF="032353_0015_0FF1EF1ACC25B208">My fears were great, I trembled at the idea of being known, le&s;t the fal&s;hoods and calumnies I had written &s;hould excite the re|&s;entment of the populace, and I &s;hould become a victim to their rage. He laughed at my fears, told me there was no danger, that the people were a cowardly &s;et and that I &s;hould be &s;up|ported by &s;ome of the fir&s;t characters in the government. He &s;aid that he would advance me any &s;um to procure me a good hou&s;e, in a central place, that I might have an appearance of doing bu&s;ine&s;s; for, he remarked, if I &s;hould be di&s;covered in the place I was, and being engaged in no o&s;ten&s;ible bu&s;ine&s;s, it might create a &s;u&s;picion, that I was a Briti&s;h emi&s;&s;ary, and all our plans would be fru&s;trated. He propo&s;ed a book-&s;tore as a proper employ|ment, which would afford a good cover to our objects. At his &s;olicitation I con&s;ented, took a hou&s;e in a central part of the city at twelve hundred dollars a year, and opened a book &s;tore. He advanced half a year's rent to my landlord, and wrote to a &s;taunch friend of his in New York to &s;upply me with books, and that he would be accountable. The books were &s;ent and I opened my eyes to a new &s;cene. Here I began my Political Cen&s;or; but as my &s;tock of wit was but &s;mall my works began to
<PB N="17" REF="032353_0016_0FF1EF1C9A3AC478">&s;ink in the public e&s;timation, and it was nece&s;|&s;ary &s;ome expedient &s;hould be hit upon to re|alize the pro&s;pects before me. Having often heard, that per&s;ecution was one of the be&s;t means in the world to obtain celebrity, and excite the public attention and &s;ympathy, I fa|bricated a letter, which I conveyed to my land|lord, in which his hou&s;e was threatened, and the &s;evere&s;t denunciations were made again&s;t my&s;elf. My landlord &s;wallowed the bait&mdash;he brought the letter to me, and I wrote a pam|phlet upon it called a <HI>"Scare Crow."</HI> At fir&s;t this letter made con&s;iderable noi&s;e, and I had a rapid &s;ale for the pamphlet; but in a few days the people began to &s;moke me, and I again began to totter. Some a&s;&s;ertions were made again&s;t me in the public prints which it became nece&s;&s;ary to contradict, and therefore, I re&s;olv|ed to give a Hi&s;tory of my life and Adventures in which I blended &s;ome truth with much fal&s;|hood. A number of publications i&s;&s;ued from the pre&s;s immediately after the hi&s;tory of my life appeared, and among the number BRADFORD did me infinite injury. He alone was in po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of &s;ome facts much to my di&s;honour, and he exhibited them to the world with all the malice of a French cut-throat. So much did I
<PB N="18" REF="032353_0017_0FF1EF1E5E59CA68">&s;mart under the facts which appeared again&s;t me that I began to de&s;pair. My friend the a|gent, however, encouraged me by telling me of the number of friends I had, and by making me liberal allowances. He told me that the moment was critical, that the admini&s;tration was alarmed, that the friends to Great Britain were in con&s;ternation, and that we mu&s;t per&s;e|vere in our efforts again&s;t France and again&s;t republicani&s;m or we &s;hould be undone. That the Briti&s;h treaty had been carried to be &s;ure, but that the majority was &s;o &s;mall as to excite con&s;iderable apprehen&s;ions in the admini&s;tra|tion. That there was great rea&s;on to fear that France would manife&s;t ill temper at our con|nection with great Britain and the di&s;&s;olution of our ties with her, and that plans mu&s;t be laid to &s;ecure the ground which had been con|quered, and to effect a rupture in the end with the French Republic. He &s;aid that the go|vernment was ripe for the event; but the people had &s;uch a bias in favour of France, that the experiment would be too hazardous, unle&s;s a greater change could be effected in the public mind. He &s;ugge&s;ted the propriety of commencing a daily paper, as a preferable mode to a monthly work, for accompli&s;hing the
<PB N="19" REF="032353_0018_0FF1EF2434AA96F8">object. In &s;upport of the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a daily paper he urged the advantages which would ari&s;e to me from it; that the officers of the government would aid it with all their influence, and that he would furni&s;h a fund to give it a gratuitous circulation. I promi&s;ed to take the propo&s;al into con&s;ideration, and re|que&s;ted him to allow me &s;ome time to think of it.</P>
<P>The expected explo&s;ion from the French Republic at length took place through her mi|ni&s;ter ADET. He &s;u&s;pended his functions by order of the Executive Directory, and &s;tated the grounds of re&s;entment to the world. Al|though the people were much alarmed at this event, the Admini&s;tration were undi&s;mayed&mdash; things were working according to their plans and wi&s;hes. To make their purpo&s;es more &s;ecure, PINCKNEY had been &s;ent to &s;uper&s;ede MONROE. They were well appri&s;ed that the new mini&s;ter could not be received agreeably to national etiquette, and the exi&s;ting &s;tate of things, and the refu&s;al would prove a &s;trong argument to break entirely with the French Republic. The train was well laid and nothing was wanting but the match of time to give the explo&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="032353_0019_0FF1EF27A14F7740">
I continued my Cen&s;or and occa&s;ionally gave a political blunderbu&s;s, till the meeting of Con|gre&s;s. After Congre&s;s were in &s;e&s;&s;ion a com|munication was made to them on French af|fairs. A long letter <HI>&s;igned</HI> by the Secretary of State, and addre&s;&s;ed to the mini&s;ter PINCKNEY accompanied the communication. This letter was exactly in the &s;tile which my friend the agent &s;ugge&s;ted, and was well calculated to fa|vour the contemplated rupture. The admini&s;|tration was determined, my friend told me, (for he was in their confidence) at all events to break with France, and to form an alliance with great Britain. To this end the letter was written and publi&s;hed, and to this end all their mea&s;ures tended. Encouraged by &s;uch flatter|ing appearances, I re&s;olved to publi&s;h a daily paper, that I might contribute my means to ac|compli&s;h the de&s;ign, and accordingly publi&s;hed my propo&s;als. My &s;ub&s;cription was rapid and great. Officers of government, clergymen and tories &s;eemed to vie with each other in my &s;up|port. The reverend <HI>Mr. Abercrombie</HI> a&s;&s;i&s;ted me in obtaining &s;ub&s;criptions, and was always ready with his aid and coun&s;el. He profe&s;&s;ed great affection for me and for the cau&s;e I was embarked in, and &s;eemed to reli&s;h the ob&s;ceni|ties
<PB N="21" REF="032353_0020_0FF1EF295E17FAC0">I now and then indulged in, as much as any of my patrons. No one can accu&s;e him of being &s;tarched.</P>
<P>It is unnece&s;&s;ary to &s;tate in this place, the temper of my paper&mdash;the libels, the fal&s;hoods and the indecencies it contained. At one mo|ment I libelled the Governor, at another Mr. MONROE, and &s;o I went on through the whole catatlogue of American patriots. Every fal&s;hood which my inveteracy to the United States for their former rebellion, to the French Republic, and to republicani&s;m could &s;upply, was dealt out with a lavi&s;h hand. Finding that &s;ome little irrita|tion had taken place in the public mind again&s;t the depredations upon our commerce by French crui&s;ers, I determined to try the temper of it, and if po&s;&s;ible by one bold &s;troke, give a com|plete a&s;cendancy to the Briti&s;h intere&s;t. To effect this I wrote a letter containing an account of an a&s;&s;ociation of <HI>Democrats</HI> to join the French in ca&s;e of an attempt upon this country, and to give this letter the appearance of reality I &s;igned it GEORGE WILSON, &s;en'r. I employed a confidential friend to copy this letter and to convey it to my letter-box. Le&s;t it might be &s;uppo&s;ed a forgery, I took care to have evidence
<PB N="22" REF="032353_0021_0FF1EF2B2035F4D8">at hand when I received the letter, to vouch for my having received it. The letter was pub|li&s;hed with all imaginable &s;olemnity; but the effect di&s;appointed me. In&s;tead of &s;eeing a violent tumult, and an immediate arre&s;tation of the leading Democrats, I was &s;ummoned to ap|pear before the Mayor of the city to an&s;wer for the publication. My con&s;ternation at this unexpected turn was inde&s;cribable. My cow|ard heart was ready to die within me. Here|tofore I never left my own hou&s;e but under cover of the night or of a fog, or before I had previou&s;ly reconoitered the &s;treet, and &s;aw that all was &s;afe; and to be obliged now to appear in propria per&s;onae, and that too before a legal tribunal, almo&s;t petrified me, I felt my heart in my breeches. My clerical friend and the agent called upon me and bade me be of good cheer. At the office of the mayor I was obliged to an|&s;wer a number of interogatories; but contrary to my expectation, I was treated with great at|tention by &s;ome of the per&s;ons pre&s;ent, which explained the words of my friend the agent when he bade me be of good cheer. In&s;tead of the puni&s;hment which I expected for the for|gery, I was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed with politene&s;s, and return|ed home with a heart as light as a feather.
<PB N="23" REF="032353_0022_0FF1EF31368513B8">Finding my&s;elf thus patronized, and finding that the intere&s;t of the king my ma&s;ter was &s;ub&s;tantially &s;upported by men in authority, I determined to publi&s;h another Cen&s;or, to which I annexed my la&s;t will and te&s;tament, or my la&s;t libel upon the patriotic Americans. Little did I then imagine that what was &s;ugge&s;ted by a &s;portive imagination, was a pre&s;entiment of my end. This la&s;t effort was too audacious&mdash; it excited general indignation and cau&s;ed an in|formation to be lodged again&s;t me of a con&s;pi|racy again&s;t the government. I was arre&s;ted, my papers were &s;eized and <HI>the plan di&s;covered, to &s;ubjugate this Country to the power of great Bri|tain.</HI> I was tried for high trea&s;on, convicted and &s;entenced to be hanged and my body to be delivered to the profe&s;&s;or of anatomy for di&s;&s;ection. Thus have I arrived at life's gole, and thus am I rewarded for an uninterrupted cour&s;e of infamy and wretchedne&s;s. I hope my unhappy fate will prove a warning to others and that an ignominious end will make &s;ome atonement for the crimes of my life. My object was, and I now &s;olemnly confe&s;s it in the pre|&s;ence of an offended Deity, to re-e&s;tabli&s;h the Briti&s;h dominion in this country, and to re&s;tore the United States again to their dependance
<PB N="24" REF="032353_0023_0FF1EF350AD20118">upon great Britain, and to accompli&s;h this I traduced the character of FRANKLIN and of PAINE, and of every patriot who aided in the revolution, and have remained faithful to his fir&s;t purpo&s;e.

The <HI>Democrats</HI> were my abhorrence for they were in the way of my plans. They were con&s;tantly on the watch, and often &s;ounding alarm.

<HEAD>EXECUTION AND DISSECTION OF <HI>PETER PORCUPINE.</HI></HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">WITH A GLOSSARY, BY THE AUTHOR.</HEAD>
<P>ON Saturday la&s;t made his exit, owing to a hempen neck-cloth being drawn too tight|ly about his neck, on the public &s;quare near the Centre-hou&s;e, one of PITT'S hirelings, known by the name of PETER PORCUPINE. He appeared to have had a pre&s;entiment of his fate, whether from an accu&s;ing con&s;cience, or from &s;ome intimation given him by his friend <HI>Belze|bub,</HI> cannot now be known; but &s;uch was his impre&s;&s;ion of the approaching and awful mo|ment, that he made his <HI>la&s;t</HI> will and te&s;tament, in which he intended &s;ome atonement for his life, by bequeathing his body for di&s;&s;ection. As the cau&s;es of di&s;ea&s;es are very often di&s;covered by di&s;&s;ection, and remedies are found out by the a&s;certainment of the cau&s;es, it &s;eemed to be his opinion, that there either might exi&s;t a phy|&s;ical derangement, by which moral infirmity was excited, and which might be remedied by a knowledge of the cau&s;e; or he deemed a &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion of his carca&s;e to the knife, as all the atonement he could make for the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions
<PB N="26" REF="032353_0025_0FF1EF389130B9F0">of his life, and therefore doomed him&s;elf to the expo&s;ure and fate of a <HI>felon.</HI> He was attended on his vi&s;it to the public &s;quare by a would be divine, his particular friend and coun&s;ellor, and who was converted into an apo&s;tolic mi&s;&s;ionary as &s;uddenly after the failure in a ca&s;hier&s;hip, as St. Paul was on his way to Dama&s;cus, though not by the &s;ame invi&s;ible agent. This <HI>pious</HI> prie&s;t and <HI>news-boy</HI> endeavoured to comfort him, by talking to him of a paradi&s;e, of which he knew little, and about grace, of which he knew le&s;s; but Peter was like Rachel, who wept over her lo&s;t children, and would not be comforted. De&s;pair, the con&s;equence of an over-load of guilt, had &s;eized him, and the apparent agony of his mind excited the &s;ympathy of an injured people. Like CLIVE, his eyes longed for mer|cy; but like him, de&s;pair only was to be found. His fate was the mo&s;t eloquent and pathetic lecture on morality and religion, perhaps, that ever was delivered. BOSSUET, in his famous funeral oration on Mary of Au&s;tria, the queen of France, was not &s;o eloquent, nor &s;o impre&s;&s;ive.</P>
<P>Agreeably to his own will and te&s;tament, and in conformity to a certain other decree, his body was delivered to the anatomical profe&s;&s;or for di&s;&s;ection, which exhibited the folloing phae|nomena:&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="032353_0026_0FF1EF3DF0C997F0">
On the back was a clu&s;ter of <HI>long &s;cars;</HI> they appeared like the cicatrices from deep &s;carifica|tions: the profe&s;&s;or &s;uppo&s;ed them to have been occa&s;ioned by <HI>a cat o' nine tails,</HI> as he once di&s;|covered the &s;ame appearance on the back of a Briti&s;h &s;oldier, who had been &s;everely whipped &s;ome time before his death. On opening the <HI>thorax</HI> a foetor i&s;&s;ued &s;o offen&s;ive as to be nearly intolerable. It re&s;embled the &s;mell from a dog in a &s;tate of putrefaction. On removing the <HI>&s;ternum</HI> the thoracic vi&s;cera exhibited a mo&s;t extraordinary and unnatural appearance. The <HI>lungs</HI> were of a crim&s;on colour, compo&s;ed of three lobes, the third lobe occupying the place of the <HI>media&s;tinum.</HI> They were of enormous &s;ize. On making an inci&s;ion into them a vapour aro&s;e which benumbed the faculties of the by|&s;tanders. On applying a candle near the orifice, it was extingui&s;hed. A mou&s;e was held over the lungs and he in&s;tantly expired. The&s;e phoe|nomena led to an opinion, that the air, which had been contained in the lungs, was of the &s;ame kind with that in the <HI>grotto del cani</HI> near Naples, rendered famous by the de&s;truction of <HI>dogs,</HI> called formerly <HI>gas &s;ilve&s;tre,</HI> but known at pre&s;ent by the name of the <HI>aerial or cretaceous acid.</HI> A &s;trong &s;ulphureous &s;tench aro&s;e from the lungs; they were &s;oon removed with a pair of tongs, and
<PB N="28" REF="032353_0027_0FF1EF44333223E0">thrown into the vault. The thorax &s;eemed to be exclu&s;ively allotted to the lungs, for no other vi&s;cus was to be found. Nothing remarkable appeared about the pleura.</P>
<P>On opening the <HI>abdomen</HI> the fir&s;t thing which di&s;covered it&s;elf was the <HI>&s;pleen,</HI> of an enormous &s;ize; it &s;upplied the place of the <HI>&s;tomach,</HI> ex|tended it&s;elf acro&s;s the abdomen, and occupied a con&s;iderable portion of the hypoga&s;tric region. It adhered to the <HI>diaphragm.</HI> On making an inci&s;ion into it, a yellow mi&s;t aro&s;e, which ting|ed and di&s;torted every object; the effluvia had a remarkable effect on the bye-&s;tanders; they no longer &s;aw in each other &s;ame per&s;ons; they became fretful and peevi&s;h, and would have quarrelled with each other, had not the pro|fe&s;&s;or interpo&s;ed, and by ordering the windows and doors to be thrown open, di&s;&s;ipated the mi&s;t and re&s;tored the per&s;ons to their original appearance. The <HI>oe&s;ophagus</HI> entered at the left orifice, which in the &s;tomach is known by the name of <HI>cardia</HI> and the <HI>rectum</HI> began at the right orifice know by the name of <HI>pylorus.</HI> There was but one <HI>inte&s;tine,</HI> which might be called the <HI>rectum,</HI> as it formed the <HI>anus.</HI> It was a &s;traight gut, and had no <HI>valves,</HI> by which it appeared that its contents could be di&s;charged either upwards or downwards.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="032353_0028_0FF1EF460C3DD9A0">
The <HI>liver</HI> was of unu&s;ual &s;ize, and of a &s;ooty colour. On its concave &s;ide, beginning at its upper part and extending it&s;elf as low down as the fi&s;&s;ure, was the <HI>gall bladder,</HI> of the dimen|&s;ions of an ordinary urinary bladder. It was in a &s;tate of extreme di&s;ten&s;ion. On making an inci&s;ion into it, a mud coloured fluid i&s;&s;ued from it extremely fetid. Two <HI>ducts</HI> communicated with the <HI>gall bladder;</HI> one from the <HI>oe&s;ophagus,</HI> and the other from the <HI>rectum.</HI> On opening the convex &s;urface of the liver, a large <HI>&s;ac</HI> di&s;|covered it&s;elf, in which was contained a num|ber of &s;mall living animals re&s;embling <HI>toads.</HI> There was a communication between this &s;ac and the gall bladder, by means of a duct. On being expo&s;ed to the light, the&s;e toad-like ani|mals expired, apparently in convul&s;ive agonies.</P>
<P>Between <HI>the bladder</HI> and <HI>the anus,</HI> a &s;mall black &s;ub&s;tance attracted attention, which was &s;omewhat larger than a grape-&s;hot. On exami|nation, it was found to be <HI>a heart,</HI> enveloped in a <HI>pericardium,</HI> which at fir&s;t re&s;i&s;ted the knife. After &s;ome difficulty the pericardium was re|moved, and a fluid re&s;embling coffee grounds was di&s;charged, which on examination appear|ed to be a &s;ub&s;tance &s;imilar to the excrementi|tious matter from <HI>a hog.</HI> The heart, which was little larger than that of <HI>a chicken,</HI> had a
<PB N="30" REF="032353_0029_0FF1EF4A2E6D5870">livid appearance, and in many places gangre|nous &s;pots. Both <HI>auricles</HI> and <HI>ventricles,</HI> as well as the <HI>pulmonary artery,</HI> the <HI>aorta,</HI> and the <HI>venoe cavoe,</HI> were charged with a dark coloured fluid re&s;embling putrid bile. From the &s;ituation of the heart it might be &s;aid literally to have been <HI>in his breeches.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>pancreas,</HI> or <HI>&s;weet bread,</HI> appeared either not to have exi&s;ted or to have been totally ob|literated.</P>
<P>The <HI>cranium,</HI> or <HI>&s;cull,</HI> almo&s;t baffled the ef|forts of the &s;urgeons, it was of &s;uch immen&s;e <HI>thickne&s;s</HI> and &s;olidity. Several &s;aws were ruined by it.&mdash;On removing it, the <HI>dura</HI> and <HI>pia mater</HI> made equal re&s;i&s;tance to the &s;calpel; they &s;eem|ed to be formed of <HI>corneous</HI> matter. The <HI>brain</HI> was about the &s;ize of a goo&s;e's egg. There was no <HI>cerebellum;</HI> the little which appeared was <HI>cerebrum</HI> only. On cutting into the <HI>cerebrum</HI> it was hollow, and in the cavity were myriads of &s;mall animals, which on examination with a gla&s;s re&s;embled <HI>tad-poles.</HI> The fluid which che|ri&s;hed them was of a mud colour.</P>
<P>The <HI>tongue</HI> was bifurcated and perforated. At the root of it were two &s;mall bags, the one con|taining a fluid like that in the gall bladder; the other like that contained in the &s;pleen. Each of the&s;e bags had a duct which entered them from the oe&s;ophagus.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="032353_0030_0FF1EF4DCBDAA718">
The <HI>ears</HI> had no <HI>lobes</HI>&mdash;They appeared to have been pared away by a &s;harp in&s;trument.</P>
<P>The foregoing is a &s;hort but accurate account of the di&s;&s;ection of PETER PORCUPINE, and the phoenomena which his carca&s;e di&s;covered. To the ingenious and the learned will be left the &s;olution of the extraordinary appearances.</P>
