<P>I SAILED from Bo&s;ton, on board the India Packet, Au|gu&s;t 29th, 1796, with plea&s;ant weather, winds N. E; &s;tear|ing our cour&s;e S. E. September 18th, on our cour&s;e for Cape Horn the Southern extremity of South America; plea&s;ant weather, light gales of wind attended with a little rain. October 11th.&mdash;Nothing material happened. Now have the N. E. Trades Fre&s;h. October 5th.&mdash;Some little di&s;turbance in the Ship as is Natural to &s;uppo&s;e there being five different languages on board. I beginning to make a little proficiency in Navigation. Sunday October 25th.&mdash;In Lt. 6. S. &s;tearing our cour&s;e S. E. by S. we di&s;|covered tho&s;e remarkable clouds called the Magalen clouds, &s;uppo&s;ed to take their name from being di&s;covered by Mag|alen and, are actually about vertical with the Straits of Mag|alen. The number of the&s;e clouds are three and perhaps the greate&s;t curio&s;ity ever eye beheld. One of them is jet black the others white. Perhaps the curious reader will que|ry about the truth of this relation. Hundreds are the number of we hardy Seamen, that have been eye witne&s;s of the &s;ame. To entertain the reader with a further de&s;cription of the&s;e

Their appearance is always plain unle&s;s ob&s;tructed by a cloudy horrizon, and always in the &s;ame place except revolving. Sunday October 30th&mdash;Morning fair but &s;oon found our horrizon ob&s;tucted by clouds, a melancholy &s;cene to behold; there came on a gale of wind; finding our&s;elves in eminant danger of being foundered. As the gale increa&s;ed we &s;oon found our fore topma&s;t about our cars, carried clo&s;e down to the cap. In replacing the fore topma&s;t we unfortunately lo&s;t our main top gallantma&s;t. The reader will natural &s;uppo&s;e our &s;ituation really di&s;troy|ing, and had it not been for the greate&s;t exertion we mu&s;t un|avoidable peri&s;hed. Saturday November 5th&mdash;All an entire calm nothing material to day. Sunday November 6th&mdash; Lt. 45,0. 58 m. S. very boi&s;terous weather a great variety of birds, &s;ome &s;urpri&s;ing whales &s;een in tho&s;e latitudes. No|vember 20th&mdash;By ob&s;ervation we &s;uppo&s;ed our&s;elves not far di&s;tant from Cape Horn. In the Lt. 55 S. frequently &s;eeing &s;eals of an enormous &s;ize, and every kind of ani|mal, natural to the South Seas. Thur&s;day December 2d&mdash; and then di&s;covered Cape Horn bearing N. from us. We had a very tedious time of it in geting up with the Cape; but now have very fine weather for this latitude. We find our&s;elves becalmed at this time, but &s;oon have a breeze of wind and continue our cour&s;e to the &s;outhward.</P>
<P>Dec. 9th&mdash;In Lt. 59,0. 30m. S. we di&s;covered an a&s;ton|i&s;hing Mountain of ice, that we found to be by our Quad|rants four miles in height, and &s;uppo&s;ed to be twenty four in circumference. Among the curio&s;ities in the South Sea this is con&s;idered one of the greate&s;t. However in|credible this may appear kind reader, yet hi&s;tory will con|firm it. Catching &s;ome Albetro&s;&s;es twenty feet from one wing to the other. One very remarkable thing in this lati|tude, is that the &s;un is to be &s;een nineteen hours out of twenty four, and plain day light continually. Sunday De|cember 25th&mdash;Nothing particular occured. We have now &s;haped our course for the N. W. Coa&s;t of America which is N. N. W.</P>
<P>January 1&s;t 1979.&mdash;By ob&s;ervation find our&s;elves in Lt. 25,0. 30m. S. nigh the Trophic Line. We now begin to think of prepairing our&s;elves for the N. W. Indians, where we in|tend to procure our furs. Di&s;tre&s;&s;ing is our &s;ituation on account of bad provi&s;ions, by the neglect of the owners of
<PB N="9" REF="033936_0006_0FFA15EDFB776768">the Ship, confined to three &s;mall bi&s;cuits per day, and three pints of water.&mdash;In this &s;ituation for three months, with a &s;mall allowance of beef.</P>
<P>Indulgent reader do not let me tire your patience, with unnece&s;&s;ary <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> for the want of good &s;tile being bread without it, and but little chance for improvement. Sat|urday Jan. 14th.&mdash;We have now cro&s;&s;ed the Equator and find our&s;elves in Lt. 6 N. In taking a great many &s;ea Tur|tle are tolerably well furni&s;hed for provi&s;ion. We &s;uffered a great deal for the want of water; but this day have had a very fine &s;hower of rain, which furni&s;hed us with a good &s;upply. The &s;harks are &s;urpri&s;ingly plenty in this latitude; &s;ome of them are &s;o ravenous that while our beef is toing along &s;ide, which nece&s;&s;ity requires they take it away net and all.</P>
<P>I have &s;ome occa&s;ion to complain of our Captain on the account of u&s;age, his committing a&s;&s;ault and battery on a number of the crew, is &s;omething I dont &s;o well reli&s;h, but am not in a &s;ituation to &s;eek my redre&s;s at pre&s;ent, but anx|iou&s;ly wait the arrival of the time, in which I will acquiant him that I took umbridge at it, and &s;hall with the greate&s;t propriety &s;eek my redre&s;s.</P>
<P>Sunday January 21&s;t.&mdash;Stearing N. W. by N. by ob|&s;ervation found our&s;elves in Lt. 15 N. nothing meterial oc|curred. Saturday February 18th.&mdash;We are now in Lt. 49&deg; 33 N. Being di&s;tre&s;&s;ed with a terrible gale of wind, of cour&s;e excited &s;ome alarm in us, for the &s;eas run mountains high, and to appearance &s;hould have our &s;hip covered, da&s;hing and beating as if &s;he would go to pieces every moment. Feel for us reader in this &s;ituation, what mu&s;t the feelings within our brea&s;t be, expecting to go to the bottom every minute; but through divine a&s;&s;i&s;tance and a little of our own exertions we &s;oon cleared our&s;elves of fear; got our &s;ails all in, and our yards and ma&s;t down on deck. In this &s;ituation we remained about forty eight hours, and then the &s;torm abated &s;o that in a &s;hort time we found our&s;elves in our u&s;ual &s;ituation. Kind reader, I acknowledge we had great rea&s;on to thank Neptune the governor of the Seas.</P>
<P>Tue&s;day February 21&s;t 1797.&mdash;We this morning had the good fortune to di&s;cover land, at 18 Leagues di&s;tance, and after three days &s;ail up into Norfolk Sound and come to anchor, after being at Sea about &s;ix months. Norfolk Sound is in Lat. 58&deg; 5 N. Long. not a&s;certained, but thought to be in about 129 E.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="033936_0007_0FFA4ACE2329F018">
We &s;oon was incompa&s;&s;ed about with canoes with 20, &s;ome 30 Indians in each. Not lying but about a mile from the &s;hore we had traffic enough.</P>
<P>After wooding, and watering, and repairing, we weighed our anchor and &s;ailed for Mear&s;es Bay, about 3&deg; to the Southward; had very good &s;ucce&s;s in trade, found furs plenty being the fir&s;t &s;hip on the Coa&s;t this &s;ea&s;on, purcha&s;ed our furs advantageou&s;ly, after lying at anchor about 20 days; &s;et &s;ail for Charlotte's I&s;land, about 1&deg; to the Southward; after arriving there was vi&s;ited by a great number of canoes; but could not trade much on account of the boi&s;terous weath|er; at our arrival at this place, we let go our anchor; but on account of the gales that are prevalent here, was obliged to heave it up, and make &s;ail &s;even times in the &s;pace of 24 hours. We then thought be&s;t to &s;ail for Skiticus &s;till furth|er to the Southward; the di&s;tance about 40 miles.</P>
<P>After arriving we came to anchor, and find here a large Village rather a Metropolis of this Nation, where we pur|cha&s;ed three hundred &s;kins.</P>
<P>Thur&s;day March 16th.&mdash;We have had the good fortune to procure eleven hundered &s;kins be&s;t prime. After &s;ett|ing &s;ail from this, we &s;hape our cour&s;e for Norfolk Sound, on arriving in Norfolk Sound, we &s;poke the &s;hip Di&s;patch, Capt. Bowers, from Bo&s;ton, under way out of the Sound, all hands, in good &s;pirits, excepting one &s;ick with the &s;cur|vey, a di&s;order which I &s;uffered much from. You may well conceive with what raptures we imbraced one another, they being the fir&s;t chri&s;tian people we have &s;een &s;ince we left Bo&s;ton; the Di&s;patch being bound to Mear&s;es Bay, we tacked &s;hip, and went in company with them. On our arri|val at the Bay, we found lying there, Capt. Trotter, in a brig from Providence, likewi&s;e the brig Hazzard from Bo&s;|ton, &s;loop Capt. Lay, ma&s;ter. We had no particular news from them, all were well. We here had good &s;ucce&s;s in purcha&s;ing furs. Weighed anchor and &s;et &s;ail for Norfolk Sound, arriving there, we got a &s;upply of wood and water, we then purcha&s;ed a few furs.</P>
<P>The reader will not con&s;ider me to minute in mentioning &s;o often our purcha&s;ing furs, as they were the only object of our Voyage, the number of &s;kins purcha&s;ed was 2200 and upwards.</P>
<P>The Natives of the N. W. part of this Country, are very much alike in their manners, they &s;peak a number of lan|guages;
<PB N="11" REF="033936_0008_0FFA47C8A3DBEA98">they are a hardy robu&s;t &s;et of people, about a mid|dle &s;ize, re&s;embling our Indian very much, of a tawny complexion.</P>
<P>A &s;hort de&s;cription of the animals may attract the atten|tion of the reader.
<LIST>
<ITEM>1&s;t. The &s;ea animal, the Elephant about the &s;ize of a large ox, when full grown, utter a terrible roaring that at times will excite alarm in any human crea|ture; principally of a vermilion color.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2d. The &s;ea Lion, and &s;ea Dog, are not much unlike except the Lion <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> the large&s;t.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>The fowl kind are extremely numerous &s;uch as Gee&s;e, Turkeys, Brants, Ducks, of every kind, the Eagle and Pel|ican, the large&s;t of the feathered race, in the&s;e Northern and unexplored regions.</P>
<P>The &s;ea Otter that valuable animal, eminant for its fine fur. In Cook's performances, the&s;e &s;kins were &s;old in China for 100 Dollars per &s;kin, but we &s;old them for 25 or 30.</P>
<P>May 31&s;t 1797.&mdash;We &s;et &s;ail for China &s;tearing S. S. W. with a fine breeze.</P>
<P>INDIA PACKET, June 30th, 1797.&mdash;We continue on our pa&s;&s;age for China, with a bri&s;k wind, &s;tearing S. W. in Lat. 30 N. two of our men are taken with the &s;curvey, a di&s;order very common in &s;uch a voyage.</P>
<P>I. P. July 7th.&mdash;In Lat. 21 N. we lo&s;t our main and fore top ma&s;t, in a very heavy Squall of wind, we however, re|placed them very &s;oon.</P>
<P>I. P. July 24th.&mdash;In Lat. 14 N. L. 144&deg; 30, &s;even of our crew have the &s;curvy, very bad, including our chief officer. We have been becalmed about 18 days; but have now a breeze of wind.</P>
<P>I. P. July 30th.&mdash;We had the fortune to di&s;cover the I|&s;land Tinnian, at 5 A. M. and got in with it at two P. M. We came to anchor and &s;ent our boat on &s;hore, with the &s;ick to the number of &s;even; left them and brought of a fine Bullock, and five hundred oranges, a number of cocoanuts, and &s;everal hogs. The animals on this I&s;land are entirely wild, were put on here by An&s;on, a Spaniard, in circumnav|igating the I&s;land Tinnian, is in Lat. 14&deg; 8 N. W. Long. 145 with &s;everal adjacent I&s;lands. Agragan, Sipan, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Thur&s;day July 16th.&mdash;This day we &s;et &s;ail for China, all in good &s;pirits, a pa&s;&s;age in which nothing material hap|pened. After being in the red Sea a few days, and pa&s;&s;ing
<PB N="12" REF="033936_0009_0FFA4ADBFB064A60" MS="y">through the thou&s;and I&s;lands arrived at Macow. Macow is &s;ituated at the mouth of the river Ta, or yellow River. We there came to anchor; after &s;etting &s;ail for Canton we arrived in Wambo harbour in 48 hours, the di&s;tance being 85 miles, we there came to anchor after three months pa&s;|&s;age from the N. W. Coa&s;t of America.</P>
<P>Wambo harbour, September 1&s;t 1797.&mdash;The trade of Wambo. As to the trade of this Country, it is rendered &s;omething difficult on account of their precarious di&s;po&s;i|tions being ever open and ready to accept of every advan|tage as robbing, pilfering, &amp;c. &amp;c. Their mode of wor|&s;hiping is &s;omething very peculiar; they burn incen&s;e night and morning; continually offering up &s;acrifices to the Deity, or to u&s;e their Language to Jo&s;e. There are immen&s;e numbers that are born and live on the waters until they die: It is &s;uppo&s;ed that there are one Million that live on the waters continually. It is too well known in this Country to enter into a long hi&s;tory of the Chine&s;e or their manners in general.</P>
<P>I do not wi&s;h to tire the reader with intrin&s;ic circum|&s;tances; but after di&s;po&s;ing of our furs for money, purcha&s;|ed our&s;elves a Cargo of Teas and a few China curio&s;ities, we &s;et &s;ail for Bo&s;ton, the 12th of November 1797.&mdash; Some apologies are nece&s;&s;ary in this ca&s;e, but when the reader is become acquainted with the circum&s;tances he will be kind enough to excu&s;e me for not continuing my jour|nal in a regular manner as I intended. In the commenc|ing of the Voyage; I had the misfortune of being &s;ick the mo&s;t part of the time after I left China unable to write. So I &s;hall endeavour to &s;atisfy the reader, as far as po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>October 17th.&mdash;Lo&s;t &s;ight of land on our pa&s;&s;age for A|merica after &s;ailing through the China Seas and down the coa&s;t of Africa, through the &s;traits of Balaboam by Java-head for ninety days we arrived at the Cape of Goodhope the Southern extremity of Africa. In Lat. 34&deg; 30 S. Can|ton lying in 23 N. the reader may ea&s;ily e&s;timate the Di&s;|tance. The Cape of Goodhope is the garden of Africa. It being very plea&s;antly &s;ituated and the mo&s;t &s;pacious Bay in the world lying before the town. This town was taken by the Dutch, a long time &s;ince from the Hottentots, but was three years &s;ince captured by the Engli&s;h; and now is in the hands of them and guarded by as large a &s;leet for the place as any in the known world. We found cau&s;e to lie
<PB N="13" REF="033936_0010_0FFA47F8D2BC7688">in this place ten days on account of our &s;ick: We had the misfortune to lo&s;e three of our people, on our pa&s;&s;age from China; one of them third mate. We find here a variety of people: Engli&s;h, Dutch, Hottentots, too numerous to mention. One curio&s;ity is the Hottentots &s;heep, of an en|ormous &s;ize; their tails are &s;aid to weigh 25lb. I have &s;een them to weigh 15lb. The fowl kind, the O&s;trich are found here in plenty, the Ca&s;ovarous are &s;een here, an ex|traordinary fowl. The Ca&s;ovarous are about the &s;ize of the O&s;trich, not unlike them except their wings and bru&s;tles.</P>
<P>February 3d.&mdash;This morning &s;et &s;ail for Bo&s;ton, leaving one of our men &s;ick at the Cape, and after coming too, at the I&s;land A&s;anchiant to get a little refre&s;hment by fi&s;h and turkle. We &s;et &s;ail for Bo&s;ton. A de&s;cription may not be di&s;agreeable to the indulgent reader. It is in Lat. 8 S. a continued clift of rocks, about 24 miles in circumference. De&s;titute of inhabitants or any animal except rats, and them without number of an enormous &s;ize. Of fowl kind is found here the man of war bird, and Gull in plenty. The turkle of this place are very large &s;ome weighing 900lb. It being within about 8&deg; of the Equinoctial line, S. is well adapted to them. The turtle furni&s;hed us with the mo&s;t delicious di&s;h being a variety of meats in them. For brev|ity &s;ake, I mu&s;t leave this &s;ubject and continue a &s;ketch of the pa&s;&s;age from China to America.</P>
<P>February the 24th, 1798.&mdash;We weighed our anchor for the la&s;t time with joyful hearts, and &s;et &s;ail for Bo&s;ton &s;teer|ing W. N. W.</P>
<P>I. P. March 15th, 1798.&mdash;Continuing our pa&s;&s;age to Bo&s;|ton N. E. trades &s;teering W. N. W. by ob&s;ervation find our&s;elves in 23&deg; 30 m. North about the tropic line.</P>
<P>April 1&s;t, 1798.&mdash;By ob&s;ervation we find our&s;elves in Lat. 30&deg; 24 m. upon a parallel with the W. I. I&s;lands: Noth|ing particular occurred.</P>
<P>April 7th.&mdash;We came in &s;ight of land through mi&s;take. We got into Marblehead harbour owing to the fog which was very heavy, we there took a pilot and directed our cour&s;e for Bo&s;ton, where we arrived the 10th, after a pa&s;|&s;age of 137 days from China.</P>
