His &s;acred commands delivered to me by revelation for you, are, That you publi&s;h and declare to the world in writing, without the lea&s;t fear of any human power what|ever, that the revealed knowledge of his judgments given to me, and publi&s;hed by his &s;acred command in two books (called a Revealed Knowledge of the Prophecies and Times,) for the information, warning, and benefit of all Nations, is from Him the Lord God, and is true.</P>
<P>I am likewi&s;e commanded to &s;ay to you, Write and pub|li&s;h, according to the light, wi&s;dom, and under&s;tanding, which the Lord my God gives you by his ble&s;&s;ed &s;pirit; by the mighty power of which you was converted to the full knowledge of his Word, and convinced that I am his Prophet.</P>
<P>I am likewi&s;e commanded to &s;ay to you, when your Te&s;|timony of the Judgments of God, and of me the Prince of his People, is wrote and publi&s;hed, you are directed by his &s;acred command to &s;end printed copies to the King of England, his Queen, and Family; all the Members of both Hou&s;es of Parliament; the Judges, and all the fo|reign Amba&s;&s;adors; the Mayor, and all the Aldermen of London.</P>

<HEAD>TESTIMONY, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THE que&s;tion of "Peace or War," has now been twice agitated in the Senate, &s;ince the commence|ment of the pre&s;ent &s;e&s;&s;ion: and whatever may have been the deci&s;ion in tho&s;e a&s;&s;emblies, the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion is &s;till open before the tribunal of the Public. It was undoubtedly my duty, if I thought I could throw any new light on the &s;ubject, to have delivered my &s;entiments in Parlia|ment. I was prepared to do &s;o, and very anxious to obtain a hearing &mdash;Gentlemen who &s;aw me repeatedly ri&s;e for that purpo&s;e; and &s;till more, the Speaker, to whom I verbally communicated my wi&s;hes, cannot but bear witne&s;s, of my intention.&mdash;Compelled however, by circum&s;tances, to involuntary &s;ilence in that quarter, I mu&s;t now di&s;charge my con&s;cience through my pen.&mdash; Here therefore I mo&s;t unre&s;ervedly publi&s;h my opinion, That <HI>re&s;olutely to per&s;i&s;t in offen&s;ive War, is not the be&s;t method of procuring Peace.</HI>&mdash;</P>
<P>Our objections to treating with the pre&s;ent French Government are &s;tated to be, becau&s;e it is too di&s;cor|dant not to be &s;u&s;pected of in&s;tability, and too recent to afford any a&s;&s;urance of permanency. In all other re|&s;pects, the arguments in favour of Peace are clearly on the &s;ide of Oppo&s;ition; and it only remains to decide, whether for the bare chance of un&s;teadine&s;s or ver&s;ality in the actual admini&s;tration of France we are content to &s;ee almo&s;t the whole world peopled with nothing but &s;oldiers; and every e&s;tabli&s;hed form of government in Europe, not excepting our own, go to wreck in the conte&s;t. That this mu&s;t inevitably happen, unle&s;s the French be induced by general pacification to lay down their arms, no man who coolly con&s;iders the nature of
<PB N="6" REF="028790_0005_0FDD45C489EBA858">
their revolutionary &s;y&s;tem can well venture to deny. I &s;hall &s;ay nothing of the arguments founded on the pro|priety of our retaining the French colonies in ca&s;e of a peace, as a nece&s;&s;ary indemnification for our enormous expences; becau&s;e I think they have not a &s;hadow of ju&s;tice or good faith to &s;upport them. Had we &s;tood a|lone in the conflict, the doctrine would have been plau|&s;ible enough; but connected as we are and have been with various allies, each &s;triving with all his &s;trength, <HI>as we are told,</HI> and many beyond their &s;trength, in the common cau&s;e, the conque&s;ts made by any individual member of the alliance cannot po&s;&s;ibly be viewed in any other light than as prizes taken by a &s;ingle &s;hip at|tached to a fleet. The whole of the capture mu&s;t be thrown into the general ma&s;s, and &s;hould &s;erve, as far as it will go, to balance the partner&s;hip-account of pro|fit and lo&s;s. If politics and good faith do not always go hand in hand, I am heartily &s;orry for the country where they are &s;eparated. But that conduct which, in my private &s;ituation, I hold to be e&s;&s;entially wrong, I &s;hall not henceforth, in my public capacity, &s;upport as conditionally right; for that we &s;hould at all times, and under all circum&s;tances, profe&s;s a readine&s;s to <HI>treat with all our enemies whom&s;oever,</HI> I deem to be an indi&s;pen|&s;able obligation of the religion to which we have all &s;worn obedience at our bapti&s;m. Whatever opinions men might have formed of the ju&s;tice and nece&s;&s;ity of this war at its commencement, the ground has been &s;o completely &s;hifted &s;ince that period, as to authori&s;e dif|ferent &s;entiments of the propriety of its farther continu|ance, and to require new modes of conduct for its ter|mination. The &s;ituation and circum&s;tances of all the great powers of Europe are entirely changed from what they were only two years ago; and if this be the ca&s;e already, it behoves us &s;eriou&s;ly to con&s;ider, not merely the effect of this change at the pre&s;ent moment, but what progre&s;s it may be likely to make, up to any fu|ture given period: and at what time, or by what means, we may flatter our&s;elves with a more favourable oppor|tunity
<PB N="7" REF="028790_0006_0FDD45C7F9436C80">
for concluding ho&s;tilities. If we rea&s;on from pa&s;t experience, the advantages in &s;tore for us are not very inviting; and it is incumbent on mini&s;terial logic to demon&s;trate how the uniform &s;ucce&s;&s;es of the French Republic &s;hould augment our expectations of its &s;peedy overthrow. But in the cour&s;e of the pre&s;ent conte&s;t, France has not only beaten our allies, &s;he &s;eems al&s;o to have made converts of them to her cau&s;e; for I believe there is not a man well informed of what is pa&s;&s;ing on the Continent, who will not readily agree that the French are le&s;s obnoxious to the &s;ubjects of every one of the Belligerent Powers than their own haughty pur&s;e-proud confederates the Engli&s;h. The con&s;equences of this general di&s;e&s;teem under which we labour, I leave to be computed by &s;uperior adepts in political arithmetic: to my under&s;tanding, their gro&s;s amount is di&s;a&s;ter, &s;ub|jugation, and ruin. It is not a little extraordinary to ob&s;erve the very &s;ame grounds of argument pre&s;&s;ed in|to the &s;ervice of two oppo&s;ite parties, to &s;upport two contrary conclu&s;ions&mdash;Admini&s;tration contends, from the very victories of the French, that they are too ex|travagant to la&s;t: Oppo&s;ition maintains, from the rei|terated defeats of the allies, that they are too much re|duced to recover. Here then we come directly to the point at i&s;&s;ue. Does the pre&s;ent political &s;tate of Eu|rope authori&s;e our per&s;everance in ho&s;tilities, or warrant the nece&s;&s;ity of immediate pacification.</P>
<P>O for a peep into futurity! may the plain ob&s;erver allowably exclaim,&mdash;A peep into futurity? Pictures, indeed of the period to come, are exhibited to us by both &s;ides of the que&s;tion; but who &s;hall certify the ability of the painter, and who &s;hall vouch for the fidelity of the portrait?</P>
<P>It has always been ob&s;erved, that times of calamity are peculiarly fertile in vi&s;ions and progno&s;tications, predictions and prophecies. When the minds of men are &s;oftened by the pre&s;&s;ure or the apprehen&s;ion of ac|cumulating evils, then is the moment for the &s;alutary warnings of the internal monitor, and the cautionary
<PB N="8" REF="028790_0007_0FDD45C9D9B469F0">
voice of the &s;piritual guide. The great ma&s;s of the people, too &s;ore with their &s;ufferings not to gra&s;p at any offer of con&s;olation, and too credulous to form ac|curate notions of the divinity of its origin, is ea&s;ily worked upon by every &s;pecies of oracular preten&s;ion: and we all know, that when men are once &s;teadily per|&s;uaded of the authenticity of a prophecy, they are al|mo&s;t involuntarily led to perform their part towards its completion. The pre&s;ent moment teems with the&s;e an|ticipations of futurity, beyond the example of every former period. Unfortunately, whatever be the de&s;igns or merits of the various di&s;&s;eminators of the&s;e oracles, they are at lea&s;t uniform in the melancholy &s;train of their predictions: and it behoves every well-regulated government to attend minutely to the irritation the&s;e forbodings may produce on the public mind. For if their doctrines be well founded, we have not an in&s;tant to lo&s;e in adopting a complete rever&s;ion both of our moral and political &s;y&s;tem: if they be fallacious, no pains &s;hould be &s;pared to undeceive the victims of their impo&s;ition, and no puni&s;hment can be too &s;evere for the atrocious criminality of their propagators.</P>
<P>Among the productions to which I allude, there is not one &s;o general in its circulation, nor a thou&s;andth part &s;o forcible in its delineations of approaching mi&s;e|ry, as the two pamphlets intitled <Q>A revealed Know|ledge of the Prophecies and Times, and particularly of the pre&s;ent Time, the pre&s;ent War, and the Prophecy now fulfilling, wrote by the command of Almighty God, and publi&s;hed by Richard Brothers</Q>&mdash; an author who&s;e tremendous threats and unqualified anathemas fulminate dethronement and &s;peedy death on almo&s;t every one of the Sovereigns of Europe by name, and particularly on our own beloved monarch. Nor is he le&s;s liberal of his violent menaces again&s;t both our hou|&s;es of parliament, our civil and eccle&s;ia&s;tical e&s;tabli&s;h|ment, the city of London, and the whole Briti&s;h nation: and all this, too, in terms preci&s;ely &s;uited to the com|prehen&s;ion of the mo&s;t ordinary capacity: replete with
<PB N="9" REF="028790_0008_0FDD45CE3AF1A538">
grammatical faults; de&s;titute alike of harmony of ar|rangement, and elegance of diction; in the &s;tyle of a pea&s;ant, exalting him&s;elf above the mightie&s;t of princes: affirming, that he is utterly invulnerable to all human power; and braving, with the mo&s;t unruffled indiffer|ence, that government, who&s;e authority his doctrines and de&s;tination are by him&s;elf declared to counteract, and who&s;e e&s;tabli&s;hment the completion of his mi&s;&s;ion mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily &s;ubvert.</P>
<P>What &s;hall we &s;ay or think of a man who has been in the habit of writing letters to the King, the Queen, and the Mini&s;ters of State, ever &s;ince the beginning of 1792; foretelling many events that would afterwards, &s;ome of which have actually already come to pa&s;s; ad|vi&s;ing or reproving them as occa&s;ion &s;eemed to him to require, in peremptory and dictatorial me&s;&s;ages, &s;aid to proceed from God him&s;elf; and per&s;i&s;ting, though in the mo&s;t unaffected mediocrity of private life, to reite|rate his intru&s;ions, and reinforce his remon&s;trances, on each new vici&s;&s;itude of public events: nay more, who &s;teps forth to the world, in a &s;turdy publication, avow|ing all he has done, and telling to whom, on what &s;ub|ject, in what manner, and how often he has repeated this extraordinary corre&s;pondence: and makes the whole Engli&s;h nation a &s;ort of umpire between the con&s;tituted power of the State, and one ob&s;cure Individual?</P>
<P>The policy of Government, however, has, I believe, hitherto left him&s;elf and his publications, to ri&s;e or fall by their own merits; and he has been brought to trial, only by a very &s;ubordinate tribunal indeed: only a &s;ix-penny &s;pouting club! which &s;ome time ago, propo&s;ed, as a topic for debate, Whether Richard Brothers, who calls him&s;elf God Almighty's Nephew, be an impo&s;tor or a madman?&mdash;overlooking, probably, as is often the ca&s;e with very eager di&s;putants, a third po&s;&s;ibility in the &s;ubject, namely, that he was neither the one, nor the other.</P>
<P>The books which I have here brought forward, con|tain &s;umething more than that mere <HI>peep into futurity</HI>
<PB N="10" REF="028790_0009_0FDD45D28D976E60">
for which I lately expre&s;&s;ed &s;o anxious a de&s;ire. They pretend to be, particularly the &s;econd, an ab&s;tract of the brief chronicle of the future fortunes of all Europe. But an ab&s;tract, no doubt, may be incorrect; and a chronicle can be conceived totally wanting in authenti|city. To fix the&s;e imputations on the pre&s;ent work, nothing more is nece&s;&s;ary than to adopt the pithy deci|&s;ion of the &s;pouting club, that Richard Brothers mu&s;t be either impo&s;tor or madman. To &s;upport the fir&s;t propo&s;ition, we mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily di&s;cover &s;ome private intere&s;t, &s;ome per&s;onal gratification, &s;ome premeditated deception, lurking under the plau&s;ible preten&s;ions of philanthropy and piety: the &s;econd can only be fully made out by &s;ome proof of glaring incon&s;i&s;tency in his profe&s;&s;ions: and in both the&s;e particulars I hold him in|finitely &s;uperior to all imputation. Uprightne&s;s of in|tention, and candour of &s;oul, breathe through every line of his compo&s;ition. But in vouching for his ho|ne&s;ty, I do not, <HI>&agrave; priori,</HI> conclude his infallibility. I can only &s;ay, that if it were po&s;&s;ible he &s;hould deceive others, I am morally certain, from the internal evidence of his whole work, that he is him&s;elf the fir&s;t victim of the deception. On what criterion then &s;hall we decide his merits? to what authority &s;hall we appeal? His own an&s;wer is, <Q><HI>Search the Scriptures your&s;elves.</HI> As Chri&s;ti|ans, You <HI>mu&s;t</HI> acknowledge them to be the perfect &s;ources of all veracity, <HI>and let them be the touch&s;tone of my a&s;&s;ertions.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Here let us pau&s;e for a moment, and reflect, that if we take him at his word, we are once more con&s;igned to the my&s;terious depths of Daniel, E&s;dras, and of the Revelations, where &s;o many ingenious interpreters, and athletic commentators, have been already &s;hipwrecked. How &s;hall we &s;cape a &s;imilar calamity? If it be po&s;&s;i|ble on this &s;ea ever to make a &s;afe harbour, we mu&s;t certainly &s;trike out &s;ome new cour&s;e, and take for our compa&s;s the following con&s;iderations on the nature and properties of prophetic writing.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="028790_0010_0FDD45D397271020">All prophecies are neither more nor le&s;s than true genuine aenigmas, in which the meaning is &s;o nicely and artificially enveloped by ambiguity of &s;en&s;e and of expre&s;&s;ion, that until we be furni&s;hed by the inventor him&s;elf with the proper clue to unravel them, they are calculated to appear as a ti&s;&s;ue of the mo&s;t incongruent ab&s;urdities. Of the&s;e prophetical compo&s;itions, &s;ome are compact and clo&s;e, like the greater part of the Pa|gan oracles, and others more copious and diffu&s;e. In the former ca&s;e, every word, I had almo&s;t &s;aid every letter, comes in for its &s;hare of meaning; and the key that does not preci&s;ely fit every one of them is good for nothing. No allowance is to be admitted for any thing &s;uperabundant or extraneous. In the longer compo&s;i|tions a greater latitude prevails: among &s;everal &s;entences, or di&s;tinct members of one &s;entence, the meaning is all contained in a &s;ingle phra&s;e only, which is to be con|&s;trued with all the minute preci&s;ion and undeviating con&s;i&s;tency required in the former ca&s;e, while the other parts are only thrown in to mi&s;lead the ob&s;erver. Ju&s;t as if the real objects to be repre&s;ented in a picture were &s;oftened down, melted away, and ob&s;cured in the di&s;|tances of the back ground, while the prominent features of the de&s;ign, that occupy the front of the canvas, &s;hould be formed of adventitious or frivolous repre&s;entations, of no con&s;equence or nece&s;&s;ity to the piece. In&s;tances of both kinds will occur as we proceed; and frequent &s;pecimens of each may be found in the different prophe|cies of the Old Te&s;tament, which are acknowledged by all &s;ound critics and expo&s;itors to allude to the coming and &s;ufferings of the Me&s;&s;iah.</P>
<P>In this place it may not be &s;uperfluous to mention, that in the occupation of decyphering my&s;terious and allegorical modes of compo&s;ition, I am far from being undi&s;ciplined. If I have been rather negligent of our own &s;acred writings, I have at lea&s;t been in the habit of be&s;towing unwearied attention on tho&s;e of the old Hind&uacute;s; writings not widely di&s;&s;imilar in &s;tyle and manner from the prophetical treati&s;es in our own Bible.
<PB N="12" REF="028790_0011_0FDD45D8DF8AD828">
Nor have my re&s;earches been altogether fruitle&s;s, &s;ince I have been fortunate enough to di&s;cover the true mean|ing couched under the Hind&uacute; triad of Energies or pow|ers, called Brahma, Vi&s;hnu, and Shiva, which I affirm to be nothing more than poetical per&s;onifications of <HI>matter, &s;pace,</HI> and <HI>time,</HI> and I &s;ay, that by the proper application of the&s;e three terms, all the &s;urviving re|mains of genuine Brachmanical mythology may be truly elucidated.</P>
<P>Fortified therefore with this pre-acquired aptitude for &s;uch &s;tudies, I &s;at down with plea&s;ure to the ta&s;k re|commended by Mr. Brothers, namely, to read the mo|dern hi&s;tory of Europe in the prophetic records of the Old and New Te&s;tament.</P>
<P>For this purpo&s;e, nothing was requi&s;ite, but to ex|amine, by the te&s;t of human &s;agacity, whether the clue furni&s;hed by him were in gro&s;s and in all its parts per|fectly commen&s;urate to the whole tenor and purport of the my&s;teries to be unraveled; for if it failed in any one particular, or were found too long or too &s;hort in its application to any one in&s;tance&mdash;<HI>actum e&s;&s;et de toto</HI>&mdash; The works of God are all without flaw; and for this clue to po&s;&s;e&s;s that degree of perfection, it mu&s;t nece&s;|&s;arily have proceeded from God him&s;elf, who con&s;truct|ed the vi&s;ions of the prophecies at fir&s;t, to the very in|tent that they never &s;hould become intelligible, until, at the time de&s;tined by his holy will and plea&s;ure, the true <HI>mot de l'aenigme</HI> &s;hould be revealed to his creatures; and when once this clue &s;hould come to be known, any man whatever, with a competent &s;hare of learning and indu&s;try, might comprehend and expound all the &s;ecrets to which it applies, as well as the very man to whom it was originally imparted.</P>
<P>To make this point more intelligible, I &s;hall ob&s;erve, that with re&s;pect to the four bea&s;ts in the vi&s;ion of Da|niel (and the &s;ame in any other ca&s;e) it might happen, and probably has happened, that &s;ome man or other &s;hould form a very probable gue&s;s as to the meaning of a &s;ingle bea&s;t, or even two. But what has never been
<PB N="13" REF="028790_0012_0FDD45DA3B9AA6D8">
done, and what never could have been done, but by direct revelation from God, is to find a key, one and indivi&s;ible, that &s;hould apply perfectly and equally well to all the four: &s;o that taking each of them &s;everally, or the whole in a ma&s;s, the true meaning &s;hould be no le&s;s per&s;picuous aad palpable in their union than in their &s;eparation. And &s;o with regard to the Babylon mentioned in the Revelations. The Portrait of Rome is &s;o evident in that part where Rome is really meant, that not a &s;ingle commentator of the hundreds who have handled the pa&s;&s;age has ever once mi&s;taken it. But they have all erred in &s;uppo&s;ing that Babylon univer&s;ally, and in all ca&s;es, &s;ignified the &s;ame Rome: and I have no doubt, but that very clear and intelligible de&s;cription of Rome in one place, was expre&s;sly in&s;erted for the &s;ole purpo&s;e of mi&s;guiding, and putting to fault, their conjectures on other parts of the prophecy, where a different city is alluded to under the &s;ame title. And this is agreeable to the ordinary conduct of God's providence towards mankind. He has not totally denied them light; but the ray which he has graciou&s;ly imparted to them, only &s;erves to lead them a&s;tray, if they for a moment give loo&s;e to the wanderings of their own imaginations.</P>
<P>This then is the que&s;tion:&mdash;Has Richard Brothers po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this clue, and has he declared it in his book? I an&s;wer, Yes; becau&s;e I am &s;ure I found it there. But at the &s;ame time, I affirm, he makes very little u&s;e of it, becau&s;e he comes at his knowledge a &s;horter way.</P>
<P>He indeed pretends to an immediate and direct in|&s;piration from God. And I take upon my&s;elf to prove, by the ordinary exertion of human &s;agacity, that he is really in&s;pired. And I &s;hall prove it in this manner.</P>
<P>He tells us in a dry, conci&s;e, unqualified a&s;&s;ertion, that &s;uch a thing is &s;o and &s;o&mdash;as he has it from God; but he gives us no rea&s;on why it &s;hould be &s;o; and we &s;ee at once that he repeats his le&s;&s;on by hear-&s;ay. I will take <HI>his</HI> clue, and lead you on &s;tep by &s;tep through the different degrees of analy&s;is, till you come at the very
<PB N="14" REF="028790_0013_0FDD45DEC7C05830">
conclu&s;ion with which he &s;ets out:&mdash;&s;hewing you by &s;cientifical proce&s;s, and almo&s;t ocular demon&s;tration, all the predicaments which he has totally omitted:&mdash;and &s;o connect my arguments with his affirmations, that they &s;hall mutually &s;upport, corroborate, and confirm each other. The analy&s;is, on my part, &s;hall give evi|dence to the authenticity of his in&s;piration; and the a&s;|&s;ertion, on his part, &s;hall <HI>&egrave; conver&s;o</HI> bear witne&s;s to the fidelity of my expo&s;ition.</P>
<P>And now, to give &s;ome previous te&s;timonial of my own preten&s;ions in this mode of inve&s;tigation, conform|able indeed to the general line of Mr. Brothers's decla|rations, but not explicitly mentioned in any part of them&mdash;I affirm from my own di&s;coveries, that the pro|phet Daniel po&s;itively and particularly denounces anni|hilation to the Briti&s;h navy in this war. And on proof of this propo&s;ition, in the cour&s;e of my E&s;&s;ay I am con|tent to re&s;t my whole preten&s;ions to penetration.</P>
<P>If we con&s;ult the map of Europe, it will be found to comprehend little more than the dominions of the following &s;overeigns&mdash;</P>
<P>The Emperor of Germany, and the Princes of the Empire.</P>
<P>The Empre&s;s of Ru&s;&s;ia.</P>
<P>The Pope.</P>
<P>The Kings of England, France, Spain, Pru&s;&s;ia, and Sardinia.</P>
<P>To every one of the&s;e has Mr. Brothers progno&s;ti|cated a fatal cata&s;trophe; and I a&s;&s;ert that of my&s;elf, without any a&s;&s;i&s;tance from him, (for, when I called upon him expre&s;sly to beg explanation and &s;atisfaction, he had no other an&s;wer for me, than that I mu&s;t exa|mine the &s;criptures) I have di&s;covered the fate of every one of the&s;e to be unequivocally announced in the pro|phecies of Daniel and E&s;dras. If I &s;ucceed in fully e&s;tabli&s;hing the&s;e points only, and I &s;hall do more, there is an end of altercation: we very fairly may, <HI>nay,</HI> we ought, and by the mo&s;t rigid rules of &s;ound criti|ci&s;m
<PB N="15" REF="028790_0014_0FDD45DF5F4F7508">
and logic we mu&s;t, give him credit for all the re&s;t of his predictions&mdash;<HI>ex pede Herculem.</HI></P>
<P>Now for the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion. It mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be dry; and what it wants in entertainment mu&s;t be made up, if po&s;&s;ible, by conci&s;ene&s;s on my part, taking care at the &s;ame time to omit nothing of importance.</P>
<P>Daniel, in one of his vi&s;ions, tells us that he &s;aw four bea&s;ts<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>And four great bea&s;ts came from the &s;ea, different from one another.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t was like a lion, and it had eagle's wings; I beheld till the wings were plucked, when it was lifted up on the earth, and made &s;tand no the earth as a man: and a man's heart was given to it.</P></NOTE>; the&s;e were interpreted to him to be four kings. All the commentators on this chapter have &s;ought the&s;e kings in four &s;ucce&s;&s;ive monarchies, and they have all laboured in vain to fix any one of them with accuracy and preci&s;ion.</P>
<P>Mr. Brothers gives us the clue to the whole my&s;tery in a &s;ingle word&mdash;he &s;ays, "they are four kings <HI>now.</HI>"</P>
<P>For very obvious rea&s;ons, I omit to &s;peak of the fir&s;t bea&s;t, which we are told means the king of England; and &s;hall u&s;e &s;o much the le&s;s ceremony with the &s;econd.</P>
<P>"And behold another bea&s;t, a &s;econd like to a bear: and it rai&s;ed up it&s;elf on one &s;ide; and it had three ribs in the mouth of it, between the teeth of it: and they &s;aid thus unto it: "Ari&s;e, devour much fle&s;h."</P>
<P>Mr. Brothers with mo&s;t laconic preci&s;ion &s;ays <Q>This ver&s;e means the pre&s;ent Empre&s;s of Ru&s;&s;ia.</Q></P>
<P>Now for the proof. It will hardly be contended me, that the bear is not a ju&s;t, apt, and congenial &s;ymbol for the Ru&s;&s;ian territory and empire; for, as we &s;ay the <HI>Roman eagle,</HI> the <HI>Briti&s;h lion,</HI> or the <HI>Chine&s;e dragon,</HI> &s;o we &s;ay the <HI>"Ru&s;&s;ian bear."</HI> In the famous little trea|ti&s;e of John Bull's Law-&s;uit, England is called <HI>John Bull,</HI> France <HI>Lewis Baboon,</HI> Holland <HI>Nic Frog,</HI> and Ru&s;&s;ia <HI>Peter Bear.</HI> Nor is it po&s;&s;ible that any other monarchy in Europe &s;hould be typified by this animal. Be&s;ides, as, in a complete well-written prophecy, every part mu&s;t mutually bear upon and &s;upport all the re&s;t,
<PB N="16" REF="028790_0015_0FDD45E0C72AABC8">
to make one compact whole, we mu&s;t pre&s;ently &s;ee, by the remainder of the context, than this bear can be no other than the pre&s;ent Empre&s;s of Ru&s;&s;ia. <Q>It rai&s;|ed up it&s;elf on one &s;ide;</Q> that is, it extended its do|minion, it exalted its power all on one &s;ide. And how could Ru&s;&s;ia do otherwi&s;e? What is there worthy of her ambition to the we&s;t? and to the ea&s;t and north all is already her own! all her exertions mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be, as we all know they have been, directed towards the &s;outh, and aiming pointedly at Con&s;tantinople. <HI>"And it had three ribs in the mouth of it between the teeth of it."</HI> This is the true <HI>crux criticorum.</HI> If I can &s;urmount this ob&s;tacle, all other impediments will dwindle to nothing. Fir&s;t, then, let us con&s;ider the po&s;ition of the&s;e ribs: they are in the mouth, but not within the teeth, for they are between them; therefore they are exactly in the place, and performing the functions of files or whet&s;tones, to &s;harpen the teeth: and indeed the words they utter, figuratively mark out their office, &s;aying, "Ari&s;e, devour much fle&s;h." What then is it that we can properly denominote a file or whet&s;tone for the teeth? Appetite: appetite, and nothing el&s;e. And where is appetite or hunger properly &s;ituated? What is its local habitation?&mdash;The &s;tomach:&mdash;and the &s;tomach is enclo&s;|ed within the ribs. Now we mu&s;t all agree, that the &s;tomach could not be vi&s;ibly repre&s;ented in a vi&s;ion as lying between the teeth; but that the ribs (the ca&s;e of the &s;tomach) having a form not very unlike that of the hone to file, may be put in&s;tead of the &s;tomach, in the office of giving an edge to the teeth, to mark the voracity of appetite. But why then <HI>three</HI> ribs?&mdash;Here we come to the grand deci&s;ive ma&s;ter-&s;troke of the character of the pre&s;ent Empre&s;s? becau&s;e her appetites are three, and they are all in&s;atiable to devour human fle&s;h: in&s;atiable lu&s;t, in&s;atiable ambition, and in&s;atiable cruelty. Now for the preci&s;e <HI>time,</HI> I had almo&s;t &s;aid the very day and hour, to which the Prophet alludes. <Q>And they &s;aid thus unto it: Ari&s;e, devour much fle&s;h.</Q>&mdash;<HI>Ari&s;e?</HI> So then the teeth were dormant, quie&s;cent, immove|able:
<PB N="17" REF="028790_0016_0FDD45E514EAD3F0">
they required a &s;timulus, a whetting, a prey &s;uit|ed to their ta&s;te, to rou&s;e them, and &s;et them to work. I now a&s;k the whole country, and more particularly his Maje&s;ty's Mini&s;ters, whether we have not been em|ployed for above the&s;e two years in endeavouring to whet, &s;tir up, and animate the great Catherine, who is one of the high contracting parties, and a principal in this mo&s;t de&s;tructive war, without being able to move her one inch: nor have we yet obtained from her a &s;in|gle &s;hip, or even a &s;ingle man, to aid in the overthrow of this enormous Republic of France. But when her own predominating pa&s;&s;ions get between her teeth, and &s;harpen her appetite; <HI>then</HI> &s;he can <HI>ari&s;e</HI> fa&s;t enough, and devour the fle&s;h of thirty or forty mi&s;erable Poles in a fortnight, and almo&s;t in cold blood, ju&s;t as &s;he had be|fore &s;erved the &s;ame number of Turks at I&s;mael.</P>
<P>And now, if I have not triumphantly proved this bear to be the pre&s;ent Empre&s;s of Ru&s;&s;ia, as Mr. Brothers &s;ays &s;he is, then there is neither meaning in language, nor conclu&s;ion in logic.</P>
<P>Let us next try if we can equally well tame and fa|miliari&s;e the third bea&s;t:</P>
<P><Q>After this I beheld, and lo! another like a leopard, which had upon the back of it four wings of a fowl. The bea&s;t had four heads, and dominion was given to it.</Q></P>
<P>Mr. Brothers informs us, this means Louis XVI. the late King of France.</P>
<P>Now of all the bea&s;ts of the earth, Why is the king or nation of France mo&s;t like a leopard?</P>
<P>Naturali&s;ts have ob&s;erved the leopard to have all the malicious playfulne&s;s of the cat or monkey united with all the ferocity of the tyger; and Voltaire's de&s;cription of his own countrymen exactly tallies with this idea; for he &s;ays they are a compound of the monkey and ty|ger. Nor is this all: for the delicate variegation of the leopard's &s;pots, and the beautiful &s;leekne&s;s of his fur, exactly mark out the Pari&s;ian petit-ma&icirc;tre. I might have added, that, as the leopard's &s;pots are
<PB N="18" REF="028790_0017_0FDD45E659E3C308">
&s;prinkled in regular confu&s;ion, and of nearly equal &s;ize, over his whole body, &s;o were the royal robes of the kings of France &s;prinkled all over with fleurs-de-lis of gold. But this leopard of Daniel's had four heads; and one of the&s;e, which St. John in the Revelations (though omitted by Daniel) &s;ays he &s;aw cut off, and afterwards healed, Mr. Brothers tells us, means the death of Charles I. <HI>of England,</HI> and the re&s;toration of monarchy in the per&s;on of his &s;on Charles II. This very circum&s;tance, which &s;eems at fir&s;t to throw an inexplicable difficulty in the way of interpreting the whole bea&s;t as repre&s;en|tative of the king of France, is the very clue which mu&s;t lead us to the ju&s;t and infallible &s;en&s;e of the aenig|ma; and is of it&s;elf quite &s;ufficient to evince that the explication comes from a power more than human.</P>
<P>Every body knows that our Charles I. was betrothed to the Infanta of Spain; but that on going incognito to Madrid to &s;ee her, he broke off the match, and returned home through Paris, where he fell in love with Henrietta of France; to his marriage with whom all his &s;ub&s;equent misfortunes and premature death are to be attributed. His two &s;ons Charles and James, who both reigned in England, were avowed or concealed pen&s;ioners of the court of France, and the latter died in that country, a refugee, and wretched dependant on the o&s;tentatious ho&s;pitality of Lewis XIV. It is impo&s;&s;ible then to deny for a moment, that the Stuart family were a &s;upernumery head on the body of the French monarchy; but dying before it. Louis XVI. is the &s;econd head; and he pe|ri&s;hed, like the fir&s;t, by decollation, &s;ome time &s;ub&s;e|quent to the lo&s;s of his throne. The third head is the pre&s;ent king of Spain, a lineal de&s;cendant of Lewis XIV. of France, who placed the Spani&s;h crown on his grand|&s;on's head: but a deciduous crown it is, and &s;ure to fall; for, as the main head and heart of the bea&s;t are gone with Louis XVI. it is certain that none of its members, much le&s;s any one of its heads, can long &s;urvive the cata&s;trophe. Con&s;anguineal and political alliances co|operate to point out the king of Sardinia as the fourth
<PB N="19" REF="028790_0018_0FDD45E7CE4F6038">
head, who&s;e dominions we have guarantied to him. He has two daughters married to the two brothers of Lewis XVI. and Mr. Brothers is thus perfectly warranted by Daniel in &s;aying, that <Q>it is not all the navy of England nor the armies of Europe united, can prevent the king of Sardinia from being dethroned.</Q></P>
<P>Now we &s;ee to demon&s;tration how well the four heads of this leopard tally with the actual &s;tate of Europe.&mdash; Had the prophet meant to de&s;cribe four &s;ucce&s;&s;ive &s;ove|reigns of the &s;ame kingdom, or four &s;eparate kingdoms united under the &s;ame &s;overeign, the bea&s;t in prophetic language could not po&s;&s;ibly have had more than one body, and one head. But as he alluded to four di&s;tinct and nearly independent monarchs, bound together by the clo&s;e&s;t ties of alliance and intere&s;t, he beautifully repre&s;ented one body as the common centre of union to four di&s;tinct heads.</P>
<P>I had almo&s;t forgotten that this French leopard had four wings of a fowl.&mdash;Well, the&s;e <HI>wings</HI> are nothing but <HI>&s;ails:</HI> they both belong to the &s;ame element. Who does not know that <HI>&s;ail</HI> and <HI>wing</HI> are, in all languages, convertible terms? And when Daedalus is &s;aid to have made wings for him&s;elf and his &s;on Icarus to fly from Crete, does any man doubt that they &s;ailed away in &s;hips? The wings are the fleets of France, and their number is <HI>four,</HI> becau&s;e tho&s;e fleets pervade all the quarters of the globe. But why then the wings of a <HI>fowl?</HI> Here I mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily let out the di&s;covery, to which I have already appealed as the te&s;t of my own in|dividual &s;kill in prophetic phra&s;e. Though <HI>fowls</HI> may traver&s;e the atmo&s;phere on their wings, from one end of the world to the other, the eagle alone is queen of the air; and to her all the feathered creation mu&s;t ne|ce&s;&s;arily &s;trike &s;ail. Now Daniel has expre&s;sly &s;aid that the eagle's wings were attached to the body of the Bri|ti&s;h lion (the fir&s;t bea&s;t); and he adds, alas! <Q><HI>I beheld,</HI> until the wings thereof were plucked.</Q></P>
<P>The final di&s;&s;olution of the&s;e three fir&s;t bea&s;ts is thus &s;ummarily &s;et forth by the Prophet:</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="028790_0019_0FDD45EBB740C680"><Q>As concerning the re&s;t of the bea&s;ts, they had their dominion taken away, yet their lives were prolonged for a &s;ea&s;on and time.</Q></P>
<P>That is, in plain Engli&s;h, they mu&s;t all lo&s;e their crowns, as Lewis XVI. did, (who was one of three,) a|bout two years previous to the lo&s;s of their lives. Now I do po&s;itively affirm, that in the&s;e in&s;tances, as far as they go, we mu&s;t either reject the prophecies of Daniel as ab&s;urd, aprocryphal, forged, and fal&s;e, or admit that Mr. Brothers, who has &s;o completely unlocked their my&s;terious allu&s;ions, has received directly from God him&s;elf the key <HI>for that purpo&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>Our Author has entered much more into detail re&s;pect|ing the fourth bea&s;t, than any of the former, for which rea&s;on I &s;hall take &s;o much the le&s;s notice of him. But it is impo&s;&s;ible not to feel the full force of his applica|tion of the prophecy to the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, in that little horn that grew up after the former, "in which <HI>were eyes as the eyes of a man,</HI>" viz. perpetually on the watch, and looking &s;harp out after every pro&s;pect of additional territory, or immediate profit, without regard to the means:&mdash;whether in France, or in England, or in Po|land, or any other where el&s;e&mdash;neither an acre nor a dol|lar comes ami&s;s to him. "And I <HI>beheld!</HI>" &s;ays Daniel, "becau&s;e of the great words which the horn &s;pake."&mdash; The prophet him&s;elf &s;eems here to &s;ympathi&s;e with the a&s;toni&s;hment of all Europe, at the mon&s;trous atrocities and intolerable bla&s;phemies of the Duke of Brun&s;wick's famous manife&s;to, which I am &s;orry I have not here by me, to in&s;ert as a comment on the divine text. The ruin and death of this dete&s;table horn I &s;hall pre&s;ently &s;hew from E&s;dras: Daniel gives it us in the 26th ver&s;e: <Q>But the judgment &s;hall &s;it, and they &s;hall take away his dominion, to con&s;ume and to de&s;troy it, unto the end:</Q>&mdash;as well as in the lump with that of the bea&s;t.</P>
<P><Q>I beheld even till the bea&s;t was &s;lain, and his body de&s;troyed, <HI>and given to the burning flame.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Mr. Brothers mo&s;t truly interprets this pa&s;&s;age, as relating to the death of the Emperor of Germany, (p. 33)
<PB N="21" REF="028790_0020_0FDD45ECFABAD9E0">
"It is," &s;ays he, "certain, and all the armies in Europe cannot &s;ave him. The judgment of God is al&s;o, that he &s;hall &s;uffer the puni&s;hment of everla&s;ting fire." He enters minutely into particulars in another part of his book, where he tells us, <Q>the Imperial family will all be cut off, and no &s;ucce&s;&s;or will for ever after ari&s;e.</Q> And again, <Q>This is Francis II. the pre&s;ent Emperor of Germany. To be related to him now, will be con|&s;idered hereafter as a capital crime.</Q>&mdash;To come at this mo&s;t tremendous cur&s;e, and al&s;o to find the parti|cular de&s;ignation of the death of the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, and the utter downfall of the Popedom, we mu&s;t have recour&s;e to the 2d Book of E&s;dras.&mdash;Now this 2d Book of E&s;|dras has hitherto been e&s;teemed an apocryphal compo|&s;ition of the lowe&s;t order, and &s;o it is termed in our church Bibles; where it is &s;aid to have been written about the time of Domitian by &s;ome learned Hebrew, to be extant only in the Latin, and to be &s;tuffed full of Jewi&s;h fables and Rabbinical rhap&s;odies. But I have always con&s;idered this &s;ame book of E&s;dras as one of the mo&s;t &s;ublime, the mo&s;t comprehen&s;ive, and the mo&s;t explicit of all the ancient prophecies. And when we &s;hall have heard his beautiful allegory of the whole Ro|man empire, from its fir&s;t republican form to its actual &s;tate at this moment, I am &s;ure we &s;hall agree that, whether E&s;dras lived in the time of Domitian, in that of Daniel, or in that of Adam, there never was a more truly wonderful and &s;uper-human epitome of a long and eventful hi&s;tory revealed from the pen of man. It is in the xith chapter.</P>
<P><Q>Then I &s;aw a dream, and behold there came up from the &s;ea an eagle, which had twelve feathered wings, and three heads. And I &s;aw, and behold &s;he &s;pread her wings over all the earth, and all the winds of the air blew on her and were gathered together. And I beheld, and out of her feathers there grew other con|trary feathers, and they became little feathers, and &s;mall. But her heads "were at re&s;t: the head in the mid&s;t was greater than the other, yet re&s;ted it
<PB N="22" REF="028790_0021_0FDD45EE9BCE7438">
with the re&s;idue. Moreover, I beheld, and lo! the eagle flew with her feathers, and reigned upon earth, and over them that dwelt therein. And I &s;aw that all things under heaven were &s;ubject unto her, and no man &s;pake again&s;t her, no, not one creature upon earth. And I beheld, and lo! the eagle ro&s;e upon her talons, and &s;poke to her feathers, &s;aying, Watch not all at once; &s;leep every one in his own place, and watch by cour&s;e. But let the heads be pre&s;erved unto the la&s;t. And I beheld, and lo! the voice went not out of her heads, but from the mid&s;t of her bo|dy.</Q></P>
<P>Here in the&s;e fir&s;t ten ver&s;es we have an Iliad, and more than an Iliad, in a nut&s;hell.&mdash;The <HI>eagle</HI> is the type of Rome. In this at lea&s;t I &s;hall not be in danger of contradiction.</P>
<P>But what is the meaning, in this and &s;everal other pa&s;&s;ages of the Prophet, of the word <HI>&s;ea?</HI>&mdash;It cannot be taken literally; for Rome is an inland city.&mdash;It mu&s;t therefore be ob&s;erved, as a general rule, that in allego|rical writings, every word is a portion of the allegory; and thus if the eagle be allegorical, the &s;ea from whence it ari&s;es is allegorical al&s;o. We have the direct expla|nation of it in the Revelations, where mention is made of the great Whore that &s;itteth upon many waters.&mdash; And in the 15th ver&s;e of the &s;ame chapter, the angel &s;ays, <Q>The waters which thou &s;awe&s;t, where the Whore &s;itteth, are <HI>peoples,</HI> and <HI>multitudes,</HI> and <HI>nations,</HI> and <HI>tongues.</HI></Q> This eagle, therefore, coming up from the &s;ea, is the city of Rome gradually ri&s;ing among the na|tions of Italy.</P>
<P>The Prophet fir&s;t is made to behold all the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive vici&s;&s;itudes of her fate, wrought up into one compact a&s;&s;emblage. Her extent of dominion is marked by her wings over the whole earth. Her twelve feathered wings are the twelve Cae&s;ars, and her three heads are, the Pope, the Emperor of Germany, and King of Pru&s;|&s;ia. Well indeed might it be &s;aid, that the heads <HI>re&s;ted;</HI> for as yet they were nothing but embryos in the womb
<PB N="23" REF="028790_0022_0FDD45F2431DA738">
of futurity. "And I beheld," &s;ays the Prophet, "and lo! the voice went not out of her heads, but <HI>from the mid&s;t of her body."</HI>&mdash;This is the true &s;pirit of prophetic lore, this is the genuine &s;park of Promethean fire! How was it po&s;&s;ible in &s;uch few words, and yet with &s;uch a&s;toni&s;hing accuracy, to delineate the focus from whence emanate all the rays of republican authority?</P>
<P>Ver. 12. <Q>And I looked, and behold! on the right &s;ide there aro&s;e one feather, and reigned over all the earth: and &s;o it was, that when it reigned, the end of it came, and the <HI>place</HI> thereof appeared no more.</Q></P>
<P>The feather that now ro&s;e up on the right &s;ide was Julius Cae&s;ar; and the Prophet's expre&s;&s;ion is very re|markable&mdash;<Q>And &s;o it was, that when it reigned, the end of it came, and the <HI>place</HI> thereof appeared no more.</Q>&mdash;We &s;ee clearly that this reign expired &s;ud|denly, almo&s;t at its very commencement, and was fol|lowed by a certain period of interregnum.</P>
<P><Q>So the next following &s;tood up, and reigned, and had a great time; and it happened, that when it reigned the end of <HI>it</HI> came al&s;o, like as the fir&s;t, &s;o that it appeared no more. Then there came a voice unto it, and &s;aid: Hear thou, that ha&s;t borne rule over the earth &s;o long: this I &s;ay unto thee, before thou beginne&s;t to appear no more, There &s;hall none af|ter thee attain unto thy time, neither unto the half thereof.</Q></P>
<P>The next feather after this interval is Augu&s;tus. To put the matter out of all doubt, the in&s;pired writer takes particular care to inform us of the great length of his reign: a circum&s;tance remarkable enough of it it|&s;elf, but rendered much more &s;o, by his being &s;o mi|nutely accurate as to &s;tate with preci&s;ion, that the reign of no other prince who &s;hould ever after govern that coun|try &s;hould attain even to half the duration of that of Augu&s;tus. And therefore it is impo&s;&s;ible this ver&s;e &s;hould be interpreted of any other emperor but him.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not here follow the Prophet through the next ten ver&s;es from the 17th to the 27th&mdash;(They de&s;cribe
<PB N="24" REF="028790_0023_0FDD1C898C686058">
the re&s;t of the Cae&s;ars, and the &s;ub&s;equent commotions in the &s;tate)&mdash;but &s;hall go on to the 28th ver&s;e.</P>
<P><Q>And I beheld, and lo! the two that remained thought al&s;o in them&s;elves to reign: and when they &s;o thought, behold! there awaked one of the heads that were at re&s;t, namely, it that was in the mid&s;t for that was, greater than the two other heads, and then I &s;aw that the two other heads were joined with it. And behold! the head was turned with them that were with it, and did <HI>eat up</HI> the two feathers under the wing that would have reigned. But this head put the whole earth in fear, and bear rule in it over all tho&s;e that dwelt upon the earth, with much oppre&s;&s;ion; and it had the governance of the world <HI>more than all the wings</HI> that had been.</Q></P>
<P>Now we come to the Papacy, to that great head in the mid&s;t, to which were joined the two other heads; namely, the States which were thereafter to form the dominions of the Empire and the King of Pru&s;&s;ia. The gradual encroachments of that &s;piritual predominance over all the temporal authorities of the time are admira|bly de&s;cribed by the head <HI>eating up</HI> the two feathers that would have reigned. And <HI>this head put the whole earth in fear.</HI> How? By launching its mo&s;t bla&s;phemous thunders in interdictions, excommunications, and every &s;pecies of eccle&s;ia&s;tical artillery, <HI>with much,</HI> very much <HI>oppre&s;&s;ion,</HI> as &s;ays the Prophet. Now for the clo&s;e of the prophetical drama:</P>
<P><Q>And after this, I beheld, and lo! the head that was in the mid&s;t &s;uddenly appeared no more, like as the wings; but there remained the two heads, which al&s;o in like &s;ort ruled upon the earth, and over tho&s;e that dwelt therein.</Q></P>
<P>The reformation, and revolt of &s;o many nations from the Pope's power, both temporal and &s;piritual, are de|&s;cribed in the&s;e ver&s;es; and his downfall is expre&s;sly mentioned to precede that of the other two heads, namely, the Emperor and the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, who
<PB N="25" REF="028790_0024_0FDD45F3C2429918">
continue to reign now, <HI>in like &s;ort as the wings</HI> (or twelve feathers) formerly did.</P>
<P><Q>And I beheld, and lo! the head upon the right &s;ide devoured it that was on the left &s;ide.</Q></P>
<P>Words cannot more expre&s;sly pronounce that the King of Pru&s;&s;ia is de&s;tined to fall principally by the means of the Emperor of Germany. I &s;ay <HI>principally,</HI> becau&s;e Mr. Brothers mentions that the Empre&s;s of Ru&s;&s;ia will a&s;&s;i&s;t in his de&s;truction. But, from this ver&s;e, I have not a particle of doubt, but that &s;he will in this ca&s;e act only as an auxiliary in the Emperor's quarrel, even though &s;he may contribute more than an equal &s;hare to his victory.</P>
<P>After this comes the great catacly&s;m, the mo&s;t dread|ful tremendous judgment upon the Emperor:</P>
<P>Ver&s;e 36.&mdash;<Q>Then I heard a voice which &s;aid unto me, Look before thee, and con&s;ider the thing that thou &s;ee&s;t. And I beheld, and lo! as it were, a roaring lion cha&s;ed out of the wood; and I &s;aw that he &s;ent out a man's voice unto the eagle, and &s;aid, Hear thou; I will talk with thee; and the Highe&s;t &s;hall &s;ay unto thee, Art not thou it that remaine&s;t of the four bea&s;ts whom I made to reign in my world?</Q></P>
<P>Before we go any farther, it may be nece&s;&s;ary to re|mark, that the Prophet, without any one circum&s;tance alluding to the connection between him and Daniel, comes here all at once into the hi&s;tory of the four bea&s;ts, and expre&s;sly declares that his eagle is the very &s;ame with that fourth bea&s;t which Daniel &s;aw, but did not de|lineate; only we are certain that it could not much have re&s;embled an eagle, from the partial account he has given of him. If, however, Daniel's fourth bea&s;t be the Emperor of Germany, this mu&s;t al&s;o be the &s;ame Emperor. And <HI>vice ver&s;&acirc;;</HI> if <HI>this</HI> be the Emperor, as the whole preceding narrative does not leave the &s;mall|e&s;t po&s;&s;ibility of a doubt, Daniel's bea&s;t mu&s;t be the Emperor al&s;o. I &s;hall omit the preliminary articles of accu&s;ation again&s;t his conduct, and come at once to the judgment pronounced upon him, and all the members of his family, by God, in the 45th ver&s;e:</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="028790_0025_0FDD45F53A6A29A0"><Q>And therefore appear no more, thou eagle, nor thy horrible wings, nor thy wicked feathers, nor thy ma|licious heads, nor thy hurtful claws, nor all thy vain body.</Q></P>
<P>Every member, limb, joint, and articulation of the whole eagle, is here put in requi&s;ition, and &s;eparately enumerated, to take in every &s;cion and branch of that devoted generation. Mr. Brothers might therefore well &s;ay, <Q>That to be related to the Emperor now, would hereafter be deemed a capital crime.</Q></P>
<P>The &s;ame cata&s;trophe of the Papacy, the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, and the Emperor, is al&s;o clearly pointed out in the next chapter of E&s;dras, which contains an interpre|tation, after the prophetic mode, of the vi&s;ion which I have ju&s;t gone through. I &s;hall only here make u&s;e of the 26th, 27th, and 28th ver&s;es of that xiith chapter, which run thus:</P>
<P><Q>And whereas thou &s;awe&s;t that the great head ap|peared no more, it &s;ignifies that one of them &s;hall die upon his bed, and yet with pain.</Q></P>
<P>This is incontrovertibly the Papacy, as I have before explained it. We have long &s;een it wa&s;ting with a grievous &s;ickne&s;s, and it is now on its death-bed ex|piring in great agony. Mr. Brothers tells us in his book, that the Emperor will &s;oon give it the <HI>coup de grace.</HI></P>
<P><Q>For the two that remain &s;hall be &s;lain with the &s;word.</Q></P>
<P>The Emperor's authority, and that of the King of Pru&s;&s;ia, are now in apparent health: their downfall, therefore, being de&s;tined to be &s;udden, will have no appearance of a natural decay, but may be likened to a violent death by a &s;word.</P>
<P><Q>For the &s;word of the one &s;hall devour the other; but at la&s;t &s;hall he fall through the &s;word him&s;elf.</Q></P>
<P>When the&s;e two great potentates &s;hall quarrel, we cannot po&s;&s;ibly doubt but that the Emperor will pre|&s;ently demoli&s;h his Pru&s;&s;ian Maje&s;ty; and therefore we are at no lo&s;s to a&s;certain their different per&s;ons in this place. And now, having &s;een all the&s;e heroes fairly brought to the grave, I &s;hall here take my leave of
<PB N="27" REF="028790_0026_0FDD45F9D588B200">
them, and proceed to a new &s;ubject; for which purpo&s;e we mu&s;t open the Revelations.</P>
<P>Mr. Brothers tells us, that the Babylon mentioned in the xviiith chapter Apocalyp&s;e, does not mean Rome, but London&mdash;contrary to the expre&s;s &s;entiment of all former expo&s;itors; and he proves his po&s;ition in a very &s;atisfactory manner, by &s;hewing, that the various and multiplied allu&s;ions to navigation and commerce, in the de&s;cription of this Babylon, cannot po&s;&s;ibly be &s;trained, with any propriety, to indicate an inland city, totally incapable of &s;hipping, and remarkably de&s;titute of trade. His remarks are perfectly ju&s;t and appo&s;ite; all I have therefore to do, is, to corroborate and confirm his proofs, by others drawn from the nature of the articles of mer|chandize &s;aid to have been dealt in there. Ver&s;es 11, 12, 13.</P>
<P><Q>And the merchants of the earth &s;hall weep and mourn over her; for no man buyeth her merchandize any more: the merchandize of gold, and of &s;ilver, and precious &s;tones, and of pearls, and fine linen, and purple, and &s;ilk, and &s;carlet, and all thyine wood, and all manner of ve&s;&s;els of ivory, and all manner of ve&s;&s;els of precious wood, and of bra&s;s, and iron, and marble, and cinnamon, and odours, and ointments, and frankincen&s;e, and wine, and oil, and fine flour, and wheat, and bea&s;ts, and &s;heep, and hor&s;es, and chariots, and &s;laves, and &s;ouls of men.</Q></P>
<P>Here we have an in&s;tance of the prophetic art I for|merly mentioned, by which the prominent features of the repre&s;entation or vi&s;ion are &s;uch as are put on pur|po&s;e to mi&s;lead the ob&s;erver; and the key to the my&s;te|ry lies quite in the &s;hade and ob&s;curity of the back ground. For all this long and tedious enumeration of wares and commodities is really nothing at all to the bu&s;ine&s;s of the prophecy, who&s;e real explication lies wholly in the la&s;t five words, <HI>"&s;laves and &s;ouls of men."</HI> What nation is notorious for its exten&s;ive and abomina|ble traffic in &s;laves? Surely no part of Italy. I would a&s;k an honorable gentleman, who&s;e unparalleled exer|tions and per&s;everance in the cau&s;e of his oppre&s;&s;ed fel|low-creatures do him &s;o much honor in the &s;ight of God and man, whether <HI>he</HI> cannot in an in&s;tant put his finger
<PB N="28" REF="028790_0027_0FDD45FB3AA9F990">
on the city rendered particularly infamous <HI>by dealing in human fle&s;h!</HI> We all know it is the <HI>A&s;&s;iento</HI> whole&s;ale trader; it is the <HI>City of London.</HI>&mdash;But &s;ouls of men are al&s;o &s;old there&mdash;<HI>Souls of men?</HI> And where can &s;ouls of men be properly deemed an article of trade? Certainly not in Rome, where ignorance and prie&s;tcraft bind up the &s;ouls of all their deluded &s;ubjects in chains of ever|la&s;ting adamant. Still le&s;s in the <HI>ci-devant</HI> Paris, or Vienna, or Madrid, or any other city under a de&s;potic government, where tyranny, who&s;e e&s;&s;ence it is to ex|tingui&s;h and utterly annihilate the human mind it&s;elf, leaves not a &s;ingle man who can truly and properly <HI>call his &s;oul his own.</HI> It is here, in England, it is in this and of liberty, where every man <HI>has a &s;oul</HI> which he can keep or &s;ell as he plea&s;es, that this article can alone be called a merchandize; and Parliament is the grand em|porium for the commodity.</P>
<P>Mu&s;t I &s;peak out? Mu&s;t I produce an in&s;tance? Well, then, I <HI>have</HI> an in&s;tance: I my&s;elf am that in&s;tance, and the Speaker is a living witne&s;s to the truth of my a&s;&s;ertion. There as he &s;at in his chair, day after day, for three years together, beholding me crouched behind the Trea&s;ury Bench, with my &s;oul in my hand, like a country girl in the market with her butter and eggs be|fore her, anxiou&s;ly waiting for the lucky moment when the Tellers would come and rid me of my burthen, that I might run home and hide my&s;elf. And while I <HI>did</HI> &s;ell my &s;oul, it was all in the true &s;pirit of commercial credit <HI>that &s;o peculiarly di&s;tingui&s;hes this country:</HI> I &s;old it purely upon tru&s;t: I never have received one &s;hilling; and now I am taught by experience to apprehend that the purcha&s;er will never pay me one farthing for it. But though I &s;old my &s;oul, I could never &s;ell my tongue. While the one loitered an abandoned pro&s;titute in the market, the other remained &s;ullenly immovable at home. The emancipation of the former would have opened the pri&s;on doors of the latter&mdash;could I have caught the Speaker's eye. But it is of no con&s;equence now&mdash;<HI>Libe|ravi animam meam</HI>&mdash;and both my &s;oul and tongue are from henceforrh at liberty.</P>
<P><HI>London,</HI> as Mr. Brothers &s;ays, is known al&s;o in the Revelations by the name of <HI>Sodom:</HI> for which he quotes this pa&s;&s;age of the xith chapter:</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="028790_0028_0FDD45FCDD5CBD28"><Q>And their dead bodies" (viz. tho&s;e of the two wit|ne&s;&s;es) "&s;hall lie in the great city, which &s;piritually is called Sodom in Egypt, <HI>where al&s;o our Lord was cru|cified.</HI></Q></P>
<P>And in what city can our Lord be &s;aid to have been crucified except at Jeru&s;alem, which &s;urely was not in Egypt?&mdash;Why there, <HI>and there only,</HI> where the ble&s;&s;ed &s;acrament of redemption is pro&s;tituted to the purpo&s;es of venality and ambition: where the benefits of &s;alva|tion are bartered for filthy lucre: where the holy com|memoration of Chri&s;t's death is degraded to a te&s;t and qualification for holding civil employments: and con|&s;equently, where the two witne&s;&s;es of the Go&s;pel are trampled under foot by authority of the State?&mdash;In no nation under heaven but in England, in no church in the world but that by law e&s;tabli&s;hed here, does &s;uch a profanation exi&s;t: in that very church too which ex|pre&s;sly &s;ays in one part of her own ritual, that <HI>taking the &s;acrament unworthily is crucifying Chri&s;t's body afre&s;h, and eating and drinking our own damnation.</HI> <Q>Out of thine own mouth will I condemn thee</Q>&mdash;thou wicked church!&mdash;Here then we have in St. John both Babylon and Sodom to &s;ignify one and the &s;ame city, ju&s;t as we have the two cities of London and We&s;tmin&s;ter within the &s;ame boundary; but which of the two be Sodom, and which Babylon, I leave to be decided by that &s;a|gacious a&s;&s;embly which has no doubt mo&s;t oracularly pronounced whether Richard Brothers be an impo&s;tor or a madman.</P>
<P>And here let me a&s;k, whether I have not, in the mo&s;t clear and &s;atisfactory manner, and upon full proof, e&s;|tabli&s;hed every one of tho&s;e po&s;itions which I at fir&s;t pledged my&s;elf to maintain: as well in &s;upport of Mr. Brothers's well-founded preten&s;ions to divine in&s;pira|tion, as of my own qualifications and abilities for exe|cuting the ta&s;k I had undertaken? And I hope tho&s;e per&s;ons of the better conditions of life, whom I know to have &s;aid that this book was calculated to make an impre&s;&s;ion on none but the mo&s;t illiterate vulgar, will be now inclined to admit that it <HI>may</HI> have weight even with a man not much le&s;s in&s;tructed or experienced than them&s;elves, nor very greatly their inferior in un|der&s;tanding,
<PB N="30" REF="028790_0029_0FDD460163420040">
literature, or &s;ituation. Mo&s;t of all, I hope that every one will at lea&s;t think it worth while to examine the Scriptures calmly and attentively, to com|pare them with Mr. Brothers's a&s;&s;ertions, and then judge for him&s;elf; for I can a&s;&s;ure my readers, that I could never obtain the &s;malle&s;t explanation of any part of his book from Mr. Brothers, whom I called upon expre&s;sly for that purpo&s;e. He drily referred me to my Bible, ob&s;erving that he could neither &s;ubtract from, nor add a &s;ingle word to, what God had expre&s;sly dictated to him. The field is &s;till open for fre&s;h labourers; I have occupied but a &s;mall part of it; as well becau&s;e it is fit this work &s;hould be compri&s;ed within moderate limits, as becau&s;e I am &s;atisfied that I have heaped proof upon proof beyond all rea&s;onable nece&s;&s;ity for full conviction. And here I &s;hall clo&s;e the &s;ubject as far as relates to politics, and employ a few words with regard to Mr. Brothers him&s;elf.</P>
<P>He &s;ays he is come to recall the Jews to their native country; and for the proof of his divine mi&s;&s;ion he refers us to the mira|culous di&s;coveries contained in his books, from a per&s;ua&s;ion that, if we admit the prophecy, we cannot reject the prophet. Now that all Scripture as well as all Tradition bears te&s;timony to the certainty of the recall of the Jews in the latter ages of the world, no man who has but a &s;mattering of acquaintance with either can for a moment pretend to deny. The main de&s;ign of Mr. Brothers, as far as he is per&s;onally concerned, is to &s;hew us that the life and conduct of the fir&s;t Mo&s;es was a &s;ort of type or pre|determined pattern for that of the &s;econd; and for this purpo&s;e he quotes a text of Scripture, which can neither be eluded nor ex|plained away, that the man de&s;tined to lead the Jews a &s;econd time to Pale&s;tine &s;hould be <HI>like to Mo&s;es him&s;elf.</HI> The Parallel between the two per&s;onages Mr. Brothers &s;tates to have tallied hitherto, and he a&s;&s;erts that it will continue to do &s;o; for, as Mo&s;es a&s;cended from the ark of bull-ru&s;hes, &s;o did Mr. Brothers ri&s;e from a &s;hip, having been bred to the navy. This coincidence of charac|ters might be evident at fir&s;t &s;ight, Mr. Brothers a&s;&s;erts, that by the command of God him&s;elf, he cut a wand in 1792, which is to perform preci&s;ely the &s;ame miracle with the former wand of Mo&s;es. Nor need we now be a&s;toni&s;hed or &s;candalized, when we hear Mr. Brothers affirm that God &s;peaks to him in plain di|rect words, as one man would &s;peak to another, &s;ince we kwow that in this re&s;pect Mo&s;es was favoured with a communication ex|actly &s;imilar. Mo&s;es, born in Egypt, led the I&s;raelites from E|gypt through the Red Sea into Pale&s;tine. The birth-place there|fore of the &s;econd Mo&s;es, and the country from whence he is to
<PB N="31" REF="028790_0030_0FDD4602C6C99450">
&s;ummon the modern Hebrews, mu&s;t &s;piritually at lea&s;t have at one time or other been al&s;o denominated Egypt, to make the parallel between two events move an all fours: and I have already proved, from St. John in the Revelations, that the great city (viz. <HI>Lon|don</HI>) was &s;piritually called Sodom <HI>in Egypt.</HI></P>
<P>In the &s;pirit of this parallel Mr. Brothers remarks in his &s;econd book&mdash;<Q>Pharaoh is appointed to die, and his government to be de|&s;troyed the prie&s;ts and all the abominable idolatries of Egypt &s;hall peri&s;h, never to be found any more.</Q></P>
<P>I &s;hall now &s;lightly mention a few expre&s;&s;ions to be found in Mr. Brothers's books, which have operated as &s;tumbling-blocks to weak minds. And fir&s;t, for the phra&s;e which has cau&s;ed &s;o much offence, where he calls him&s;elf <HI>God Almighty's Nephew.</HI> I &s;incerely hope there is no man in this country who will openly deny that Je&s;us Chri&s;t is God Almighty. If there be, I &s;peak not to him: I am &s;ure no member of the e&s;tabli&s;hed Trinitarian church can &s;afely &s;ay otherwi&s;e. Now if Je&s;us Chri&s;t had brothers and &s;i&s;ters, as is expre&s;sly proved from the Go&s;pel, the &s;on of any one of tho&s;e mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have been <HI>his</HI> nephew. Extend the line of filiation as far as we plea&s;e, through 50, 100, or 1000 de|&s;cents, the la&s;t is &s;till a nephew, lineally de&s;cended from the fir&s;t, in the &s;ame manner as every Jew to this day is a &s;on of Abraham, and as we are all of us beyond all doubt &s;ons of Adam.</P>
<P>Next, Mr. Brothers &s;ays, he was in a vi&s;ion taken up to hea|ven, where he &s;aw the Holy Gho&s;t under the figure of a &s;ilver-coloured dove. As a &s;pirit truly the Holy Gho&s;t may have no &s;hape; but that he actually appeared <HI>as a dove</HI> when Je&s;us Chri&s;t was baptized by John in Jordan, I pre&s;ume no believer in the Go&s;pel will think fit to conte&s;t with me. Again, Mr. Brothers &s;aw Satan entering London <HI>in a human &s;hape.</HI> Why what &s;hape &s;hould he be in? Perhaps, indeed, if he had repre&s;ented him with &s;aucer eyes, cloven hoofs, and a tail a fathom and a half long, all the old women of both &s;exes in this great city would have been mightily tempted to believe him. But after all, what other &s;hape can we more con&s;i&s;tently &s;uppo&s;e him to have worn in his triumphal entry into a city inhabited by men? I am only &s;orry, that, de&s;cribed as he is in robes of white and &s;carlet, he mu&s;t have been hardly di&s;tingui&s;hable at fir&s;t &s;ight from any of the Peers of Great Britain, whom I have &s;een in the &s;ame dre&s;s come into and go out of We&s;tmin&s;ter Hall at the diabolical Im|peachment.</P>
<P>Objections, but tho&s;e perfectly groundle&s;s, and founded in gro&s;s ignorance of the general cour&s;e of God's judgments, have been &s;tarted again&s;t Mr. Brothers's a&s;&s;ertion in his fir&s;t book, <Q>that God would have de&s;troyed the city of London in 1791&mdash; but for his interce&s;&s;ions.</Q></P>
<P>To &s;hew that this doctrine is not unprecedented we might in&s;tance Abraham's repeated &s;olicitations for the pre&s;ervation of
<PB N="32" REF="028790_0031_0FDD4604A1F9B548">
Sodom, and God's an&s;wers in the xviiith chapter of Gene&s;is: as well as &s;everal other &s;imiliar circum&s;tances in Scripture. But there is a pa&s;&s;age in Ezekiel which comes, if po&s;&s;ible, &s;till more exactly to the point; it is in the xxiid chapter, the title of which runs thus&mdash;<Q>V. 1. A catalogue of &s;ins in Jeru&s;alem.&mdash;17. God will burn them as dro&s;s in his furnace.&mdash;23. The gener|al corruption of prophets, prie&s;ts, princes and people.</Q>&mdash;</P>
<P>Now let us attend to the 30th and 31&s;t ver&s;es. It is God that &s;peaks.</P>
<P><Q>And I &s;ought for a man among them, that &s;hould make up the hedge, and &s;tand in the gap before me for the land, that I &s;hould not de&s;troy it; but I found none. Therefore have I poured out mine indignation upon them, &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P>Words cannot be found more inconte&s;tably applicable to Mr. Brothers's de&s;cription of him&s;elf <Q>&s;tanding in the gap before the Lord for the city, that he &s;hould not de&s;troy it.</Q> To controvert this principal, is not to want conviction, but to repel it.</P>
<P>Now to conclude: If any man, calmly attending to what I have adduced, can &s;till con&s;ider Mr. Brothers as an impo&s;tor or a madman, I wi&s;h him little joy of his feelings or his pro&s;pects. But whatever judgment be pronounced on him, let it at lea&s;t be after a fair trial and &s;ufficient hearing. Let us fir&s;t reflect, whe|ther it be po&s;&s;ible that a madam &s;hould &s;o ably and con&s;i&s;tently pre&s;s into his &s;ervice the whole body of prophecy both in the Old and New Te&s;tament, all tending to one and the &s;ame di&s;tinct end; or whether an impo&s;tor &s;hould &s;o hone&s;tly and di&s;intere&s;ted|ly entreat us only to take &s;erious care of our&s;elves and our own mo&s;t important concerns, leaving him&s;elf and all po&s;&s;ible per&s;onal advantage totally out of the que&s;tion. And what then is the point he &s;o arduou&s;ly labours? Nothing more than that we would, before it be utterly too late, relinqui&s;h this <HI>ju&s;t and nece&s;&s;ary war;</HI> ju&s;t, only becau&s;e it ju&s;tifies God's vengeance&mdash;and nece&s;&s;ary on|ly becau&s;e nece&s;&s;ary for our puni&s;hment. And I doubt not but it is his opinion, as it is mo&s;t a&s;&s;uredly mine, and my advice al&s;o, that the <HI>Fa&s;t</HI> which is appointed for the 25th of Feb. to implore &s;ucce&s;s on our arms, &s;hould be converted, by Addre&s;s to his Maje&s;ty, from both Hou&s;es of Parliament to that effect, to the purpo&s;e of a &s;olemn and &s;incere humiliation for our crimes, and a mo&s;t ear|ne&s;t &s;upplication to God for the re&s;toration of peace; and that we may take warning by the fate of our abandoned and &s;ubjuga|ted ally, not to po&s;tpone our offers for a negotiation to the very la&s;t moment, when the &s;word &s;hall already be at our throats, and all hopes of obtaining moderate terms mu&s;t be totally relinqu&s;h|ed. Let us, while it is yet po&s;&s;ible, adopt that mo&s;t divine &s;en|tence of the Go&s;pel, <HI>"on earth peace, good will towards men."</HI></P>
