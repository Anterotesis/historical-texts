<HEAD>BRIEF INTRODUCTORY STRICTURES UPON LATE BLASPHEMOUS WRITINGS, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>A PERSONS' rai&s;ing the du&s;t of controver&s;y a|gain&s;t the holy &s;criptures, ob&s;cures not their lu&s;tre (however blinded he may be him&s;elf) but like the Sun they &s;hine with unclouded light, far above little emmets encompa&s;&s;ing them&s;elves in clouds of du&s;t.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid; let the pot&s;herd &s;trive with the pot&s;herds of the earth, but woe to him that &s;triveth with his Maker. And who&s;e heart can endure, and who&s;e hands can be &s;trong, when the woe falls with all its weight? However great a per&s;on may be thought to be, he is quite unequal to a combat with his Maker, and is but an emmet of a larger &s;ize.</P>
<P>The abilities of a writer, and the beauty of his &s;tyle go far in gaining him pro&s;elytes. Words are the dre&s;s of thoughts, whether tho&s;e thoughts are truths or lies; and the beauty of the dre&s;s, draws no &s;mall &s;hare of attention in favour of the writer. An attorney, who in the cau&s;e of fal&s;ehood employs all the force of eloquence, may &s;o charm his hearers, that they will have no ear for plain truth, appearing in a plain dre&s;s, upon the oppo&s;ite &s;ide; &s;how and appear|ance
<PB N="4" REF="032052_0003_0FF0D990B77B2FA0">often captivate the inclination and draw with it the judgment in its favour.</P>
<P>The force of the language of the Author of the Age of Rea&s;on is well known. The &s;trokes of his pen are &s;ufficient to convert many to any fal&s;ehood he wi&s;hes them to embrace. The world not long &s;ince, has been pre&s;ented with a &s;pecimen of his a|bilities, di&s;played again&s;t Him in who&s;e hand his breath is. His pen dipped in the blacke&s;t fal&s;ehood, has &s;hed bla&s;phemies again&s;t the Lord of Glory, who in the days of his fle&s;h, bore the bla&s;phemies of this man's predece&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P>Sordid intere&s;t actuated his pen; he &s;aw that infi|delity was in the height of fa&s;hion, and that bla&s;phe|ming Je&s;us would turn to his worldly advantage; and like an attorney, ready to di&s;play his talent in any cau&s;e whatever, he at once bla&s;phemes the word of God, trumpets his own fame, and gets his reward. Had he lived where it would have turned to his ignominy, it is pre&s;umed his pieces had never &s;een the light.</P>
<P>Could he have found his intere&s;t in painting the Chri&s;tian Religion in beautiful colours, it would re|ceive no benefit from it; nor can it receive any dam|age from his repre&s;entation of it. It &s;tands on a ba&s;is firm as the everla&s;ting mountains, the truth of God; and will triumph when men greater than he, and even kings &s;hall call on the rocks to fall on them and hide them from the wrath of the lamb.</P>
<P>Though multitudes are willingly carried away with plau&s;ible language, in a ca&s;e of life and death, and in the concerns of that life who&s;e length no pen can de&s;cribe, yet none of God's de&s;igns in his word can be fru&s;trated.</P>
<P>The holy &s;criptures declare them&s;elves to be the word of the living God. No man may pre&s;ume to dictate in what way God's word &s;hall be communica|ted. It mu&s;t be in the way, which he plea&s;es, who gives no account of his matters.</P>
<P>It is written P&s;alm 68, 11. The Lord gave out
<PB N="5" REF="032052_0004_0FF0D992642C48D0">the word, great was the company of tho&s;e who pub|li&s;hed it. The prophets, and apo&s;tles, and all that were in&s;pired, make up this company. Beautiful upon the mountains are their feet, bringing good news from a far country in on hand, and full evidence of their mi&s;&s;ion in the other. The te&s;timony they bring is not their's but God's. It is the King's Pro|clamation, and they are only heralds. It is written, where the word of a king is, there is power. The te&s;timony in the &s;criptures is all divine. It &s;tands high above all the a&s;&s;aults of the mo&s;t &s;ubtle and powerful upon earth. The blows men aim again&s;t it recoll upon them&s;elves. He that &s;its in the hea|vens, laughs, and hath in deri&s;ion, the mo&s;t combi|ned, and malignant force employed again&s;t it. P&s;alm 24.</P>
<P>The te&s;timony of God is not moved by any opin|ion which either individuals or even whole kingdoms may have about it. Its being the fa&s;hion in France, or any other country, to make it of no effect to them&s;elves, by tradition, in one age, and in another, to reject tho&s;e traditions and the &s;criptures with them, does not affect the holy &s;criptures any more than the late convul&s;ions and carnage in France affected the cour&s;e or &s;hining of the &s;un in the heavens.</P>
<P>Whole nations di&s;believing the word God, or perverting it from its native &s;implicity, and fathering their favourite plans upon it, does but fulfil its pro|phecies; the wi&s;dom of men plotting again&s;t it proves their own folly; their power employed again&s;t it works their own ruin. Great is the truth and will prevail. When the curtain drops, and this world of phantoms di&s;appears, realities will be brought into full view, to the angui&s;h of many.</P>
<P>Then it will be manife&s;t, as if written with a &s;un beam, that the &s;criptures are the word of that God who&s;e voice &s;pake the heavens and earth into exi&s;tence, and the &s;ame forcible voice which calls up the dead from their graves.</P>
<P>Events in Europe, for a &s;eries of ages have been a
<PB N="6" REF="032052_0005_0FF0D9971F510B48">fulfilment of &s;cripture prophecy, as to the appear|ance, growth and decline of the man of &s;in; and e|vents of the pre&s;ent age, are a fulfilment of a part of that prophecy yet remaining to be completed. Matters are ripening for an i&s;&s;ue which is little tho't of; and indeed it is foretold both that men &s;hall not expect it, and that in the twinkling of an eye it will fearfully &s;urprize them. When they &s;ay peace and &s;afety then &s;udden de&s;truction cometh upon them as travail upon a woman with child, and they &s;hall not e&s;cape.</P>
<P>Whether it will be allowed, that the boa&s;ted rea&s;on of the pre&s;ent age hath been truly exemplified, and carried out into practice in France, the centre of it, I &s;hall not examine; but it may be boldly affirmed, that the boa&s;ted rea&s;on of this author leads a man in|to a labyrinth of fond conjectures, and dreams, and there leaves him to peri&s;h, and turn to corruption, in fearful apprehen&s;ions of dreadful wrath beyond the grave; but the glorious Go&s;pel of the ble&s;&s;ed God aboli&s;hes death, brings life and immortality to light, plucks out the &s;ting of death, and pre&s;ents, as the only hope of guilty dying man, <HI>Him</HI> who is the re&s;urrection and the life; in whom he that be|lieveth, though he were dead, yet &s;hall he live; and who&s;oever liveth, and believeth in him, &s;hall never die.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER I.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SON,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>TO deny divine Revelation or to hold the Truths it contains loo&s;ely is death. Sen&s;ible of your imminent Danger from a Deluge of Infidel|ity and fal&s;e Chri&s;tianity I addre&s;s you. But it can only come of God to teach you and me the things which belong to our peace before they are hid from our eyes. What I now write is de&s;igned as a preli|minary to other Letters upon the clear light of di|vine revelation contra&s;ted with the darkne&s;s of a boa&s;ted age of rea&s;on. The expre&s;&s;ion an age of rea&s;on is plau&s;ible and captivating. The word rea|&s;on is often abu&s;ed and pro&s;tituted to the vile&s;t pur|po&s;es. Men boa&s;t of rea&s;on, and every one is fond of being thought to be under its influence. In all o|pinions a man entertains, in all actions which he does, he is ready to be per&s;uaded him&s;elf and to per|&s;uade others, that he is under the guidance of rea&s;on; In all contentions between individuals or bodies of men both oppo&s;ite parties alledge that they are influ|enced by rea&s;on. The &s;ame is true of nations at war, and what is called rea&s;on in one camp pa&s;&s;es for its oppo&s;ite in the other. The oppo&s;ite opinions of men in religion are all profe&s;&s;edly grounded in rea&s;on on both &s;ides. In mo&s;t of the practices of men however ba&s;e, and even in the late barbarities in France, the actors no doubt alledged that they were governed by rea&s;on. Indeed the word rea&s;on, hath been a &s;pecious cover for the vile&s;t opinions and
<PB N="8" REF="032052_0007_0FF0D99C19684D90">practices. The boa&s;ted rea&s;on which men plead for, when examined, turns out to be the inclination of their hearts, or rather their lu&s;ts. We may &s;ee the &s;pring and fountain head of this boa&s;ted rea&s;on in the &s;erpent's rea&s;oning to turn Eve a&s;ide from the &s;im|ple voice of revelation, and her own rea&s;oning cor|re&s;ponding to his, which clo&s;es Gen. 3, 6. And when the woman &s;aw that the tree was good for food, and that it was plea&s;ant to the eyes, and a tree to be de&s;ired to make one wi&s;e, &s;he took of the fruit thereof, and did eat. Three rea&s;ons are in her view which enclo&s;e three lu&s;ts; the lu&s;t of the fle&s;h, the lu&s;t of the eye, and the pride of life, which taking the place of a regard to God's voice, brought ruin. Awful it is to depart in the lea&s;t from the voice of God, and give ear to our own lu&s;t, under the name of rea&s;on.</P>
<P>The Apo&s;tle declares the weapons of their warfare to be mighty through God for ca&s;ting down logi&s;|mous rea&s;onings and every high thing which exalteth it&s;elf again&s;t the knowledge of God. Rea&s;onings are to be reckoned among the high things which thus &s;tand exalted again&s;t the knowledge of him. The word rendered ca&s;ting down &s;ignifies utterly de|moli&s;hing, and in knowing the true God they are ut|terly demoli&s;hed.</P>
<P>But to proceed; it will one day appear, that men are as unrea&s;onable (&s;o to &s;peak) in their rea&s;onings again&s;t the truth of God's word as they would be in rea&s;oning again&s;t the truth of the &s;un's &s;hining, though in the latter there is not that guilt.</P>
<P>Should any one chu&s;e to argue that there was no Sun in the heavens, we &s;hould be better employed in enjoying its influence, than in controverting with him. Should he chu&s;e to argue that there is no God, we &s;hould be better employed, in attending to the plain evidence of con&s;cience, te&s;tifying that ev|ery breath we draw, every beat of the pul&s;e, every motion even of a finger, and every thought of the mind, proclaims a God, in whom we live, move and
<PB N="9" REF="032052_0008_0FF0D99DDC3052E8">have our being; while every thing above, and around us declares his glory.&mdash;So if any one chu&s;es to rea&s;on again&s;t the light of the glorious go&s;pel; we &s;hould be better employed in attending to the clearne&s;s of that light, and to the Apo&s;tles, commending them&s;elves to every man's con&s;cience in the &s;ight of God, than in pur&s;uing them, into their labyrinth of rea&s;onings; knowing that if the go&s;pel be hid it is hid to them who are lo&s;t, and that the God of this world blinds the minds of them who believe not, le&s;t the light of the glorious go&s;pel &s;hould &s;hine unto them.</P>
<P>The holy &s;criptures carry in them&s;elves evidence that God is the &s;peaker, and the truth of this is en|forced upon illiterate men who have not acce&s;s to profane hi&s;tory; and who are incapable of entering into argumentation. Indeed the &s;criptures are nev|er believed in truth, but upon the bare te&s;timony of God him&s;elf, &s;peaking in them, a&s;ide from pro|phane hi&s;tory, and men's rea&s;onings to prove them true. The Record, or the witne&s;s of the three in hea|ven, 1. John 5.7, 8, 9, is plainly the witne&s;s of the one God in three per&s;ons, di&s;tinct from the witne&s;s of men. And it is there &s;aid to be greater than the witne&s;s of men; and thus it proved among the fir&s;t believers in its great effects, and thus it will prove among all who&s;e faith is unfeigned, or who have ob|tained like precious faith with them, through the righteou&s;ne&s;s of God and their &s;aviour.</P>
<P>While we turn a&s;ide from the common tract of rea&s;oning, the idea to be kept in full view, is, that the &s;criptures are the witne&s;s of God him&s;elf, carry|ing in them&s;elves evidence that they are his truth. This is the only conviction of their truth, that is to any purpo&s;e. As to any belief men may have, on account of the profe&s;&s;ed belief of the country they live in, or the belief of their forefathers, or men whom they e&s;teem for religion; as it re&s;ts on the te&s;|timony of men, it is as different as darkne&s;s from light from a belief grounded upon the record of God, and may be ea&s;ily &s;haken, by the plau&s;ible rea&s;on|ings
<PB N="10" REF="032052_0009_0FF0D9A1AF08EC90">or the &s;neers of an infidel. Indeed the &s;tep from &s;uch faith to infidelity is &s;hort and ea&s;y.</P>
<P>The &s;ame &s;hift from one to the other, which hath taken place in France, may ea&s;ily take place in any other nation now profe&s;&s;ing chri&s;tianity, when their worldly intere&s;ts favours it, and it &s;uits the policy of the nation.</P>
<P>Among our&s;elves we &s;ee tho&s;e who have received their chri&s;tianity by tradition, and not upon the te&s;ti|mony of God, holding it by a very &s;lender handle. They &s;peak of the &s;criptures as doubtful, dark and incon&s;i&s;tent with each other. Indeed <HI>they</HI> are tho't &s;carce able to &s;upport any point of doctrine or prac|tice, without the aid of &s;ome able voucher, and men find little more u&s;e for them, than to furni&s;h a je&s;t, or &s;hew their abilities in argument, and eloquence upon detached pa&s;&s;ages, or advance their intere&s;t by &s;haping what they profe&s;s to hold from them &s;o as to &s;uit the general ta&s;te where they live. More confi|dence is placed in the writings of Seneca, or &s;ome other wi&s;e pagan, by many who call them&s;elves chri&s;tians, than in the holy &s;criptures. And tho&s;e who would be e&s;teemed guardians of the word of God (which &s;purns at &s;uch a thought) appear to be only guardi|ans of their own intere&s;ts. The chri&s;tian world, &s;o called, who&s;e confidence is in the te&s;timony of men and not the record of God, &s;eeing their teachers &s;o divided in opinion, and belief, as well as others, either re&s;t &s;atisfied in utter uncertainty, or anxiou&s;ly grope like men in the dark, not knowing which way to look for truth.&mdash;But leaving them I would ju&s;t &s;ay that where the &s;cripture is believed upon the te&s;timony of God, it comes not in word only, but in power, and mighty indeed are its effects, which mu&s;t be manife&s;t to any one who reads with but &s;mall attention, the lives of tho&s;e who were under its influence in the be|ginning, which may be &s;een in the Acts of the Apo&s;|tles and el&s;ewhere.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER. II.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SON,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE holy &s;criptures pre&s;ent them&s;elves, not as the word of man, but the word of God. They bear the &s;tamp of divine truth, which accords with every man's con&s;cience, but is pointed like a &s;word again&s;t every man's natural bia&s;s, and therefore cannot be the devide of man. Wherever they have had effect they have borne down the rea&s;onings and lu&s;ts of men.</P>
<P>There hath been an univer&s;al &s;truggle of mankind again&s;t the &s;criptures, or the truth of God. The hi&s;tory of all ages, the hi&s;tory of all nations, even of the Jews the peculiar people &s;hews it. Their con|duct in the wilderne&s;s, and in Canaan, and the united conduct of Jews and Gentiles towards Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and the profe&s;&s;ion of his name &s;hews it. It is mani|fe&s;t not only in per&s;ecutions on account of it, but in corrupting and perverting it. A corruption of the truth is as really a &s;truggle again&s;t it as a direct oppo|&s;ition to it; even as an attempt to take Je&s;us by force and make him a King, was oppo&s;ition to his King|dom, as well as an attempt to root it out of the world. The corruption of the word of God in France in pa&s;t ages was as really an oppo&s;ition to the &s;criptures as their late rejection of them.</P>
<P>Nations who are now holding the &s;cripture cor|rupted cannot boa&s;t of being le&s;s oppo&s;ed to the Word of God, than France who has openly rejected it. All the nations who are now holding the &s;crip|tures in &s;ub&s;erviency to their own lu&s;ts, maintain a &s;truggle again&s;t them as well as France. The oppo|&s;ition of the world to the truth which appeared in the days of the Apo&s;tles hath not failed of being kept up to this day, either in rejecting the &s;criptures or cor|rupting them. The world hath uniformly main|tained its oppo&s;ition to the word of God in one way or other.</P>
<P>The way in which the &s;criptures have gained ground has been by the mere dint of evidence, bear|ing
<PB N="12" REF="032052_0011_0FF0D9A6829550E0" MS="y">down men's rea&s;onings and inclinations; and this compelled the fir&s;t publi&s;hers them&s;elves to re|ceive the &s;ame truth they publi&s;hed to others, for to them as well as others, it was like a &s;harp piercing two edged &s;word.</P>
<P>The Apo&s;tle &s;ays, 2 Pet. 1, 16, We have not followed cunningly devi&s;ed fables, when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, but were eye witne&s;&s;es of his maje&s;ty, &amp;c. It cannot be conceived po&s;&s;ible that Peter and others &s;hould invent and publi&s;h a Fable, which was fir&s;tly contrary to every natural inclination of their own hearts, and &s;econdly would de&s;troy every thing which they held dear; their intere&s;t, reputation, and comfort in life; and la&s;tly would lead them into &s;evere&s;t &s;uf|ferings from the wrath of the world kindled again&s;t them, and bring life into the utmo&s;t danger, yea &s;hould peri&s;h in it unto the death. They mu&s;t in &s;uch ca&s;e act contrary to every principle that can be in man, and it might as &s;oon be expected to &s;ee the &s;tones falling upwards.</P>
<P>Nothing &s;hort of a firm belief of the things they te&s;tified, could influence them to &s;uffer the lo&s;s of all things, and not count life it&s;elf dear; and this be|lief was firmly grounded upon the divine te&s;timony, &s;et before them in the mo&s;t convincing manner. The apo&s;tle &s;ays, we were eye witne&s;s of his maje&s;ty. John &s;ays, 1&s;t Epi&s;tle 1, 1.2, That which we have heard, &s;een and handled of the word of life, that which we have &s;een and heard declare we unto you, &amp;c. And God &s;hewed his concurrence with their te&s;timo|ny by the miracles he wrought by them. And not only the Apo&s;tles but a multitude of others, &s;ealed the &s;ame te&s;timony with their blood, in hope of life eternal through that truth; &s;o far were they too, from the lea&s;t apprehen&s;ions of its being a cunningly devi&s;ed fable.</P>
<P>The Te&s;timony of the Apo&s;tles, and the Prophets al&s;o, center in one point, the re&s;urrection of Je&s;us, after his being delivered for our offences; from
<PB N="13" REF="032052_0012_0FF0D9A8D5F6DD20">whence alone ari&s;es hope to man. This fact e&s;tab|li&s;hed the whole; and every part, both of the old te&s;|tament and the new, however wounderful, or unac|countable it may &s;eem, is e&s;tabli&s;hed with it; and all &s;eeming difficulties mu&s;t vani&s;h before it like mi&s;ts before the Sun. Many have &s;coffed at the miracu|lous things reported, &s;uch as the account of Jonah, Sam&s;on, &amp;c. but in&s;tead of being thought incredible to one who knows the &s;criptures and the power of God, they appear wonderful di&s;plays of the power of that God with whom nothing is impo&s;&s;ible. They have taken upon them too to &s;ay that many things a&s;cribed to God in the &s;cripture were unworthy of him, and have &s;uppo&s;ed them&s;elves competent judges what was becoming their Maker. Swelled with &s;elf importance they do not conceive the di&s;tance be|tween God and them, is far greater than between them&s;elves and a worm. A child or an ideot, dicta|ting a wi&s;e general or politician is not to be heeded. The di&s;parity between the wi&s;e&s;t man, and his Maker is far greater; and it is the highe&s;t pre&s;umption to determine what is fit and becoming him, who&s;e ways are as far above ours, as the heavens are higher than the earth.</P>
<P>While the twelve authori&s;ed witne&s;&s;es of the re|&s;urrection of Je&s;us, declared God's te&s;timony con|cerning his Son, and men &s;aw what an effect it had on them, and beheld the miracles which God wro't by them, they were led to &s;ay that God was with them of a truth; and this te&s;timony is not merely their's, but God's: and they con&s;idered God him&s;elf &s;peaking by their mouth. Thus it is &s;aid of &s;ome of them, 1 The&s;s. 2, 13, that when they received the word of God which they heard from the Apo&s;tles they received it not as the word of man but as it is in truth the word of God. In like manner when this te&s;timony of God which was fir&s;t communicated by the voice of the Apo&s;tles, was afterwards commu|nicated by their writings, in this way too, the word
<PB N="14" REF="032052_0013_0FF0D9AA70EFE888">was received not as the word of man but as it is in truth the word of God. The &s;ame is true of all the &s;acred writings. The holy &s;criptures then pre&s;ent them&s;elves not as the word of man but as the word of God. They point out God to be their author, without a train of rea&s;oning, as the works of creation point out God to be their creator. He is read in one, as he is in the other.&mdash;They draw a black portrait of this lower world as under the cur&s;e, &s;hew that every man by nature is a child of wrath, that every mouth mu&s;t be &s;topped, and that the whole world is become guilty before God, and that no fle&s;h can be ju&s;tified in his &s;ight in any way but through him who was made a cur&s;e in their &s;tead, and thereby redeemed them from the cur&s;e. They give a portrait of the character of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. They pre&s;ent to us his features, his likene&s;s. He is called the Word of God and there is that in them which bears his re&s;emblance as the impre&s;&s;ion does that of the &s;eal which makes it. As the world &s;tood affect|ed to him &s;o they are affected to the word of God. Of him&s;elf he &s;ays, the world hateth me becau&s;e I te&s;tify of its works that they are evil. The &s;criptures fully maintain the &s;ame te&s;timony, and incur the &s;ame hatred. The profe&s;&s;ed liking of many is no more than that of the Jews to Je&s;us, when they would fain make him a temporal King; which very thing proceeded from a di&s;reli&s;h of his real character. Men's hatred of the real truth in the &s;criptures hath been abundantly manife&s;t in perverting and putting a fal&s;e meaning to the words, as well as an open re|jection of them. It is natural to all men, though fallen, to &s;tand for what they think are their rights before their Maker, and to &s;tand oppo&s;ed to what appears to invade them; and as the word of God like a &s;harp two-edged &s;word gives a fatal &s;tab to them, and to every hope of man a&s;ide from the death and re&s;urrection of Je&s;us, leaving nothing but a fearful looking for of fiery indignation; it is impo&s;&s;ible that the world &s;hould receive it, otherwi&s;e than corrupted
<PB N="15" REF="032052_0014_0FF0D9AD6BE580C8">and perverted from its native &s;implicity. It appears impo&s;&s;ible in the nature of things that any man or number of men &s;hould invent a plan of Religion like this, &s;o oppo&s;ite to the bia&s;s of their own hearts; and the hearts of all others, with a view to its &s;pread|ing in the world, without either worldly weapons or allurements; and utterly impo&s;&s;ible it &s;hould &s;pread if it could be &s;uppo&s;ed to be divi&s;ed. Could we make the &s;uppo&s;ition that there were no &s;criptures in the world at this time. We cannot conceive it po&s;|&s;ible that they being fabulous &s;hould thus &s;pread, nor indeed that they &s;hould be invented. So it has al|ways been the ca&s;e as human nature is the &s;ame in all ages i. e. oppo&s;ed to them as they al&s;o te&s;tify.</P>
<P>The fact is obvious to all that they actually have &s;pread over the world, te&s;tifying men's guilt, and on|ly hope, in &s;pite of the oppo&s;ition of the world; and it cannot po&s;&s;ibly be accounted for in any way but this, that they are in truth the word of God; that Je&s;us Chri&s;t the &s;on of God, who gave his life a ran&s;om was rai&s;ed from the dead; and that ocular demon&s;tration of this led the apo&s;tles at the ri&s;que of life to pub|li&s;h Salvation through him alone, in oppo&s;ition to the world of Jews and Gentiles combined again&s;t it.</P>
<P>This te&s;timony confirmed by miracles and &s;ealed with their own blood forced attention in mankind, contrary to their de&s;ire, and made its way again&s;t vi|olent oppo&s;ition of heart, and was mighty through God to the pulling down their &s;trong holds.&mdash;This Te&s;timony was carried far and wide, and when men in various parts of the world, &s;aw the boldne&s;s of the&s;e witne&s;&s;es, and that their life was embarked in their te&s;timony, and beheld their miracles, and fi|nally &s;aw their blood &s;hed, in full hope of eternal life through the Lord Je&s;us, they were awed about that which they &s;tood oppo&s;ed to, they had great rea&s;on|ings among them; they wi&s;hed to appear upon friendly terms with that which exceedingly troubled them. They u&s;ed their arts with profe&s;&s;ors to en|gage
<PB N="16" REF="032052_0015_0FF0D9AFFB5A36C0">them to lower down the force of the divine te&s;|timony &s;o to &s;peak, to parley and to league with them. This had its effect on multitudes who had grown weary of the cro&s;s them&s;elves. This coalition &s;pread &s;o far that in the days of Con&s;tantine the great, the minds of his &s;ubjects were &s;o much in favour of chri&s;tianity thus modified, that it appeared con&s;i&s;|tent with &s;ound policy to e&s;tabli&s;h it, in room of pa|gani&s;m as the religion of the Roman empire called the whole world. But before it was e&s;tabli&s;hed, it cea&s;ed to be what it was at fir&s;t. It became another Go&s;pel or the go&s;pel of Chri&s;t perverted. Here was a wide gate and a broad way opened, under the chri&s;tian name, which they &s;uppo&s;ed led to life, and that many were going in thereat. From that day the world has adopted the name of chri&s;tianity, in &s;ome form or other. The name has been retained, but the thing was lo&s;t or wrapt in darkne&s;s. The continuance of the &s;criptures is hence ea&s;ily accoun|ted for. From this time being con&s;trued to men's liking, they have been forced to become a tool of &s;tate, and an in&s;trument of gain to prie&s;ts, who &s;ome|times locked them up from the common people, or when they let them out compelled men to take their interpretations of &s;cripture, for the &s;cripture it&s;elf. The word of God in their hands foretold, and te&s;ti|fied again&s;t the corruption which they were bare|facedly guilty of, as may be &s;een 2 The&s;. 2 chap. 1. Tim. 4, 1.4. 2 Tim. 3 chap. 2 Pet. 2d and 3d chapters, the Epi&s;tle of Jude, and the book of Revelations.</P>
<P>Thus becau&s;e they knew him not, nor the voices of the apo&s;tles, they fulfilled them; as the Jews long before had fulfilled the voices of the prophets re&s;pect|ing Je&s;us. Acts 13, 27. The conduct of nations called chri&s;tian, in every age &s;ince, in conformity to tho&s;e mentioned, has been a &s;tanding fulfilment of the prophecies above, and an evidence of the truth of the divine te&s;timony.</P>
<P>To return, it appears impo&s;&s;ible to conceive of the
<PB N="17" REF="032052_0016_0FF0D9B420E21358">&s;criptures having &s;o great a &s;pread in any other way&punc; So that the mind is as it were reined up to the time when the te&s;timony was fir&s;t publi&s;hed, and led to at|tend to that forcible evidence which had &s;o mighty an effect on many, and occa&s;ioned a general awe a|mong men, which led them to corrupt and e&s;tabli&s;h chri&s;tianity.</P>
<P>At this pre&s;ent time God is &s;till upholding the &s;ame te&s;timony by the writings of the prophets and apo&s;tles, though men would fain drown his voice by the noi&s;y clamour of lo here and lo there, and by at|tempts to palm that upon them for his truth, which he has never &s;poken. His voice is &s;till te&s;tifying to the world that its works are evil, and that there is no hope for any man a&s;ide from Chri&s;t Je&s;us. Its awful repre&s;entation of the character of mankind or men, of which a &s;ummary is given in the three fir&s;t chapters of the Romans, is confirmed by the hi&s;tory it gives of their conduct from age to age; witne&s;s the ac|count of the Antideluvians, Babel-builders, Sodo|mites, Egyptians, A&s;&s;yrians, &amp;c. It is confirmed in the account it gives of the Jews from age to age in the wilderne&s;s, in Canaan, before and after the cap|tivity, when the Me&s;&s;iah came and was among them, and after his crucifixion till the de&s;truction of their city and temple and utter di&s;per&s;ion.</P>
<P>The Scripture does not &s;top like the hi&s;tories of men with informing of events which have taken place, but proceeds to give a hi&s;tory of the future down to the end of time. It brings to view a con&s;tant war again&s;t the truth carried on by the old &s;erpent, the devil or &s;atan, deceiving and conducting all nations in the conflict, who are made drunk with the wine of the wrath of the fornication of the great whore, who pretending to be the &s;pou&s;e of Je&s;us commits fornication with the Kings of the earth who dre&s;s her out in rich apparel. Strikingly this has been verified in the wealth and honours both clergy and churches have obtained by a clo&s;e connexion with civil rulers.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="032052_0017_0FF0D9B5F1942768">
But to return, &s;uch is the divine te&s;timony of mankind and &s;uch the corre&s;ponding hi&s;tory. And there is no room for any to &s;tand forth and &s;ay we are better than they; no in no wi&s;e, for there is none righteous no not one. In the view of all nations, ages, and of our own characters, the heart of a man mu&s;t die within him, were it not for one character which knew no &s;in, but was made &s;in for his people that they might be made the righteou&s;ne&s;s of God in him. The &s;criptures then in all ages and at this pre|&s;ent time, be&s;peak them&s;elves to be the word of the mo&s;t high God. The Book proclaims it&s;elf divine. It is &s;aid John 8.47. He that is of God heareth God's words, which implies that God is heard in di&s;|tinction from any man. And again 1 John 4.8. We are of God: he that knoweth God heareth us, he that is not of God heareth not us. The Apo&s;tles were appointed his amba&s;&s;adors that by their mouth men might hear the words of God, and the words &s;po|ken or written by them are God's words.</P>
<P>In confirmation of the divine truth of the &s;criptures I might mention the fulfilment of their prophecy in the de&s;truction of Jeru&s;alem, and various other king|doms. The Jews remaining a di&s;tinct people among all nations to this day, is a &s;tanding evidence of their truth. Another &s;tanding evidence is the great whore committing fornication with the kings of the earth which hath lived thus deliciou&s;ly for ages; though it is true &s;he is now declining fa&s;t with a con|&s;umption. And this too confirms their te&s;timony; and particularly what hath happened in France of late appears a fulfilment of what is &s;aid Rev. 17, 16, of hating the whore and making her de&s;olate and na|ked. The prophecy of Peter 2 Epi&s;t. 2. 1, 2. ap|pears al&s;o fulfilled, where &s;hewing that fal&s;e teachers &s;hould ri&s;e under the chri&s;tian profe&s;&s;ion followed by multitudes, &s;ays by rea&s;on of them the way of truth &s;hall be evil &s;poken of. The People of France in|cen&s;ed at the pernicious ways of the prie&s;ts take oc|ca&s;ion
<PB N="19" REF="032052_0018_0FF0D9B7C04EC7F8">hence to vilify the &s;criptures the way of truth. Although this is more or le&s;s true in every country yet there it appears in a &s;triking manner. And au|thors take occa&s;ion to vilify the &s;criptures in connex|ion with the clergy, as if there had been &s;ome affinity between them, and the &s;hame of their practices be|longed to the &s;criptures. Yea they open their mouths in the mo&s;t daring bla&s;phemies again&s;t God's Word, and again&s;t Je&s;us Chri&s;t, who is the brightne&s;s of his Glory, and the expre&s;s Image of his per&s;on. The&s;e things in&s;tead of weakening, confirm the faith of God's people, as they thereby &s;ee the prophecies ful|filled.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER III.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SON,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE &s;eparation of the children of I&s;rael from all other nations, in conformity to the &s;criptures, and their continuing di&s;tinct from them, for a &s;eries of ages, in the ob&s;ervance of laws, which it is the bias of man's heart to break away from; laws which made them a laughing flock to all other people, and their holding that te&s;timony &s;acred which condemned their own conduct entirely, and left them without hope a&s;ide from mere mercy through the promi&s;ed Me&s;iah, the&s;e are a &s;trong evidence of the truth of the revelation which they held to. Here was a whole nation kept together in this manner again&s;t their na|tural inclinations, a whole nation profe&s;&s;ing a firm belief of a revelation from God, a whole nation wit|ne&s;&s;es of miracles, a whole nation to judge whether there were any tricks&punc; or impo&s;itions, and that not merely for a day or a year, but for a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of a|ges, a nation too that often &s;hewed their inclination to turn away from God, and to be conformed to other nations, but contrary to their bias were brought
<PB N="20" REF="032052_0019_0FF0D9BBB174FAF0">back by threatnings and judgements.&mdash;In their cour&s;e for ages they were led contrary to their na|tural bias by the direction of the Lord, as the two milch cows mentioned 1 Sam. 6.10, &amp;c. on whom there had come no yoke, went &s;traight away from their calves tied up at home, drawing the ark of God in a new cart, lowing as they went. As the hand of God was manife&s;t, in leading the cows a|gain&s;t their bias, &s;o it was manife&s;t in leading I&s;rael, both in the wilderne&s;s, and in Canaan; and one is an emblem of the other.</P>
<P>I&s;rael was under the guidance of the lively Oracles of God, though it is true that they often rebelled.</P>
<P>The oracles to which pagans re&s;orted for informa|tion, probably took their ri&s;e from what was ob&s;erv|ed among the Jews. But the children of I&s;rael had recour&s;e to an Oracle indeed, and had information from the mo&s;t high God. When an oracle gives information, that voice alone, in di&s;tinction from all others, is the object of attention. When God re|vealed any thing to I&s;rael, every word that he utter|ed, claimed their utmo&s;t attention. The Scriptures, the lively oracles of God, claim the &s;ole attention, and are jealous of any voice being attended to a&s;ide from them. There is no attention due to any man whatever, any further than his voice echoes (as I may &s;ay) the voice of the Oracle.</P>
<P>When Pharaoh applied for the interpretation of his dream, Jo&s;eph an&s;wers, it is not in me, God &s;hall give Pharaoh an an&s;wer of peace. And while the an&s;wer comes from his own mouth, he &s;ays again, God hath &s;hewed Pharaoh what he is about to do. Gen. 41.16, 28. So Daniel &s;aith, 2 c. 30 v. on a like occa&s;ion, but as for me this &s;ecret is not re|vealed to me, for any wi&s;dom that I have more than any living; but he a&s;&s;erts that there is a God in hea|ven, who revealeth &s;ecrets.&mdash;None of the pro|phets, or Apo&s;tles, make any more account of their own voices, when declaring what God &s;pake by them.
<PB N="21" REF="032052_0020_0FF0D9BE32F93990">Paul &s;ays, 2 Cor. 4.7, But we have this trea&s;ure in earthen ve&s;&s;els that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us. An earthen ve&s;&s;el con|taining gold and &s;ilver is overlooked, the trea&s;ure gains the whole attention. Again he thanks God 1 The&s;s. 2, 13, that when they received the word of God by his mouth, they did not receive it as his own word, but as it was indeed the word of God. And he informs, 1 Cor. 1, 1-6, that when he came to them declaring the Te&s;timony of God, he came not with excellency of &s;peech, wi&s;dom, enticing words, but was with them in weakne&s;s and fear, and much trembling, and it was that their belief &s;hould not &s;tand in the wi&s;dom of men, but in the power of God. He would be him&s;elf as it were thrown a&s;ide, as a wretch|ed guilty &s;inner, that the te&s;timony of God, of which he was the bearer, might have all its weight. He al&s;o tells the Galatians, to hold him accur&s;ed if he &s;hould preach any other Go&s;pel to them, than what God had already declared by his mouth. He al|&s;o a&s;&s;erts the &s;ame even re&s;pecting an angel from heaven. The &s;criptures in the plaine&s;t and mo&s;t expre&s;s manner hold forth the idea, that God is the &s;peaker in them. Dives in torments, is reminded that if his brethren to whom he wi&s;hed to give war|ning, did not hear Mo&s;es and the prophets, they would not be per&s;uaded by his ri&s;ing from the dead to warn them of the horrors of that torment, which he felt, and to which he &s;uppo&s;ed them advancing. This implies that God's voice by Mo&s;es and the pro|phets, was the only means of repentance. A multi|tude of pa&s;&s;ages expre&s;sly mention God as the &s;peaker in the &s;criptures, it may &s;uffice to quote a few only. The apo&s;tle quoting a pa&s;&s;age from the P&s;alms ex|pre&s;sly a&s;cribes the words to God Heb. 3, 7, Where|fore as the Holy Gho&s;t faith to day if ye will hear his voice, &amp;c. The prophet I&s;aiah pointing forward to the go&s;pel day, &s;ays, chap. 52, 6, Therefore my people &s;hall know my name; therefore they &s;hall
<PB N="22" REF="032052_0021_0FF0D9C210228DE0">know in that day that I am he that doth &s;peak, be|hold it is I. Language cannot more clearly expre&s;s both that God is the &s;peaker, and that he is al&s;o known to be &s;o by his people. But I would more particu|larly notice Heb. 1.1, 2. God who at &s;undry times and in divers manners &s;pake to the fathers by the prophets hath in the&s;e la&s;t days &s;poken to us by his &s;on. Here God is held forth as the &s;peaker in the whole revelation which the Jews ever had by means of the prophets. God hath &s;poken at what time he &s;aw fit. He him&s;elf hath cho&s;en the manner of &s;peaking, whether by a voice him&s;elf or by a me&s;&s;en|ger; whether an Angel or a man; whether by voice or writing. He is above all controul in this matter. And we find even earthly princes claim a right of ad|dre&s;&s;ing their &s;ubjects, in the way they them&s;elves chu&s;e.</P>
<P>It hath plea&s;ed God mo&s;t high, that his revela|tion to his people in the &s;everal ages of the world, &s;hould be chiefly by writing, and that they &s;hould look to the law and te&s;timony and reject every voice that &s;pake not according to that word. The greate&s;t &s;tre&s;s is laid upon what was written. The Lord re|pels each of the temptations of Satan in the wilder|ne&s;s, &s;aying it is written thus, &amp;c. Mat. 4 chap. Again he &s;ays, Luke 24, 44, Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Chri&s;t to &s;uffer, &amp;c. And Mat. 26, 44, But how then &s;hall the &s;criptures or wri|tings be fulfilled, that thus it mu&s;t be.</P>
<P>Whatever God hath &s;poken by voice or writing hath been attended with evidence that he was the &s;peaker. When Mo&s;es had a me&s;&s;age to Pharoah he gave evidence that God &s;ent him. Exod. 7, 9.10. And &s;o it was too in his me&s;&s;ages to I&s;rael. The fame may be &s;aid as to all the prophets and all the apo&s;tles.</P>
<P>In the beginning it &s;eems that divine Revelation was pre&s;erved not by writing, but in the memory of the faithful, which being comprized in few words,
<PB N="23" REF="032052_0022_0FF0D9C7C876E690">might be more ea&s;ily retained; and the great length of man's age facilitated the pre&s;ervation of it in this way. A revelation of the only hope of man was made to our fir&s;t parents immediately after the fall, in the faith of which the &s;aints lived. It is not nece&s;|&s;ary we &s;hould know all the evidence attending its being handed down to po&s;terity: I would only make one remark here, viz. that the lives of the faithful, and the lives and oppo&s;ition of the &s;eed of the &s;erpent both, were at this time and in all ages a confirmation of the divine te&s;timony, and an evidence of in truth.&mdash;We read not of any writing till Mo&s;es. Then whatever he wrote under in&s;pitation, re&s;pecting what had pa&s;&s;ed before, or took place in his own time, became a &s;tanding revelation for the Church in all ages. Additions were made to the revelation afterwards before their eyes, which when written, en|larged the book called the &s;criptures. Time after time additions were made, till the whole of the old te&s;tament was completed, which was probably about the time of Ezra.</P>
<P>The&s;e Revelations were made to God's cho&s;en peo|ple and the oracles of God in writing were put in their cu&s;tody; and they were taught to regard them alone as the pure voice of God. A departure from this idea of them gave ri&s;e to the Talmud, a roll of traditions, by which they made the &s;criptures of no effect; as Je&s;us charged them with doing and teach|ing for doctrines the commandments of men. The Apo&s;tle Peter points to this, 2. Epis. 2, 1 and &s;hews that the &s;ame thing &s;hould take place under the Go&s;pel, which prediction has &s;ince come to pa&s;s.</P>
<P>Through the cour&s;e of revelation the grand point was from time to time more clearly revealed, till the fulne&s;s of the time was come, and God &s;ent forth his Son made of a woman. The whole law was a &s;chool ma&s;ter to lead unto Chri&s;t, the end of the law for righteou&s;ne&s;s.</P>
<P>The appearance of the Son of God, was like the
<PB N="24" REF="032052_0023_0FF0D9CC77915398">ri&s;ing of the &s;un. We was u&s;hered in by his forerun|ner John, by the mini&s;try of Angels, and by many wonderful things which took place at his birth. His life, doctrine, miracles, death and re&s;urrection, were a clear revelation to them who &s;aw and heard; and when committed to writing by the Apo&s;tles, became a &s;tanding revelation to his Chruch. And what was further communicated to the Apo&s;tles, to whom God bare witne&s;s by &s;igns, and miracles, and gifts of the Holy Gho&s;t, was a continuation of the revelation, and when written were to be a completion, of the reve|lation which began in the days of Je&s;us. The Apo&s;|tles did not barely profe&s;s to be God's amba&s;&s;adors as &s;ome do at this day, but proved they were &s;o by their miracles. They had their credentials to &s;hew it with the broad &s;eal of heaven affixed to them. And what the&s;e cho&s;en witne&s;&s;es te&s;tified, fini&s;hed the whole of God's revelation to man, which clo&s;es with an awful threatening to any man that &s;hall add to, or take from the words of God, Rev. 22.18, 19.</P>
<P>The divine Record is then clo&s;ed, and as to any new revelations, dreams and vi&s;ions, we may cry a|vaunt! It becomes with full purpo&s;e to turn a deaf ear to the noi&s;y multitude, crying lo here and lo there, knowing that God is as really &s;peaking, as if he were on earth, and that it is at our peril to have any other re&s;ort. To take our idea of the &s;cripture doctrine one from another, is no more than receiving the wit|ne&s;s of man, but we are a&s;&s;ured, that he who believ|eth not God, hath made him a liar, becau&s;e he be|lieveth not the record which God gave of his &s;on, 1. John 5.10, the Apo&s;tle &s;ays, let God be true and every man a liar; and again it is &s;aid, cur&s;ed be the man who tru&s;teth in man, and ble&s;&s;ed is the man who tru&s;teth in the Lord.</P>
<P>The Holy Gho&s;t by the apo&s;tle gives a &s;olemn caution, Heb. 12.25. See that you refu&s;e not him who &s;peaketh; for if they e&s;caped not who refu&s;ed him, who &s;pake on earth, much more &s;hall not we if
<PB N="25" REF="032052_0024_0FF0D9CF15829B68">we turn away from him who &s;peaketh from heaven. Fearful will be the con&s;equence of attending to the words of man, in&s;tead of the words of God.</P>
<P>I will conclude this letter with a pa&s;&s;age of Scrip|ture, Heb. 10.28, 31. He that de&s;pi&s;ed Mo&s;es' law died without mercy under two or three witne&s;&s;es. Of how much &s;orer puni&s;hment &s;uppo&s;e ye &s;hall he be thought worthy who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, and hath counted the blood of the covenant wherewith he was &s;anctified an unholy thing, and hath done de&s;pite unto the &s;pirit of Grace. For we know him that hath &s;aid Vengeance belongeth unto me, &amp;c. It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.</P>

<P>THE invi&s;ible things of God from the creation of the world, are clearly &s;een, being under&s;tood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and God|head. Con&s;cience agrees with this te&s;timony of the Apo&s;tle. But while the works of creation enforce the thought that there is an eternal God, they give not the lea&s;t information, how &s;inful man &s;hall obtain his favour. It is not in the power of human rea&s;on to point this out. The rea&s;onings of the world in all ages, have not afforded the lea&s;t &s;park of light in this matter. Their oppo&s;ition to each other pro|claims their blindne&s;s. The whole world is in total darkne&s;s in this matter, and from the light of divine revelation. It is not uncommon for tho&s;e at the greate&s;t remove from light, to think them&s;elves mo&s;t enlightened. Every age is ready to boa&s;t of their light in Religion. Many have imagined, that men's light in religion has kept pace with their improve|ment in the Arts and Sciences; and that tho&s;e ages
<PB N="26" REF="032052_0025_0FF0D989BA3EC058">wherein the&s;e have flouri&s;hed mo&s;t, have had mo&s;t knowledge in religion. But there is no period of human Hi&s;tory which has had any light at all in Re|ligion, a&s;ide from Revelation. I will mention an age which other ages have agreed to e&s;teem an en|lightened age of the world. It was the Age when the Lord Je&s;us, and his Apo&s;tles, were on earth. Then the Greeks were in high renown for wi&s;dom; then the Roman Empire having &s;ubdued the world, was in all its &s;plendor, the Jews at the &s;ame time boa&s;ted of high improvements in religion.</P>
<P>I will now introduce what the Holy Gho&s;t &s;ays of it. See I&s;aiah 60, 4. &s;peaking of the time when the redeemer &s;hould come to Zion, he &s;ays: For be|hold the darkne&s;s &s;hall cover the earth, and gro&s;s darkne&s;s the people, but the Lord &s;hall ari&s;e upon thee and his glory &s;hall be &s;een upon thee and Gen|tiles &s;hall come to thy light, &amp;c. See again Luke 1.78, 79. The day &s;pring from on high hath vi&s;i|ed us, to give light to them who &s;it in dark|ne&s;s and the <HI>Shadow of Death,</HI> Acts. 26.17.18. Delivering thee from the people and the nations to whom now I &s;end thee to open their eyes, and to turn them from darkne&s;s to light and from the pow|er of Satan to God, that they may receive forgive|ne&s;s of &s;ins, &amp;c. We may connect with it I&s;. 42, 6, 7. I the Lord have called thee, &amp;c. and will keep thee, and give thee for a covenant of the Peo|ple, a light of the Gentiles to open the blind eyes, to bring out the pri&s;oners from the pri&s;on, and them that &s;it in darkne&s;s out of the pri&s;on hou&s;e, &amp;c.&mdash;The&s;e may &s;uffice to point out the horrors of that darkne&s;s which then over&s;pread the world, amid&s;t all their boa&s;ted light. It is pointed out as under the dominion of the prince of darkne&s;s, as in the &s;itua|tion of pri&s;oners in a dark dungeon, and the expre&s;|&s;ion &s;itting in the &s;hadow of death is enough to make one &s;hudder.</P>
<P>To pa&s;s by other periods we may ju&s;t notice that
<PB N="27" REF="032052_0026_0FF0D9D8A95DBCA8">the pre&s;ent age is &s;uppo&s;ed to be very enlightened, and perhaps men never boa&s;ted more of their im|provements and light in religion. But let the end|le&s;s diver&s;ity of &s;entiments, with that profe&s;&s;ed cha|rity for men of almo&s;t any &s;entiment, and doubtle&s;s in every point of doctrine, &s;peak for it&s;elf, what light there is in the pre&s;ent age. I would only &s;ay that the pre&s;ent time is doubtle&s;s inclo&s;ed within that pe|riod mentioned, Rev. 8, 13. Wo, wo, wo, to the inhabiters of the earth, by rea&s;on of the other voices of the trumpet of the three Angels, which are yet to &s;ound. Indeed the whole of that hi&s;tory of the future, the book of revelations, points out the earth as covered with darkne&s;s and full of the habitations of cruelty. It is true the &s;criptures are among men, but they cover that light from them|&s;elves, wre&s;ting the &s;criptures to their own de&s;truction. They love darkne&s;s rather than light. The Light &s;hineth in darkne&s;s, but the darkne&s;s comprehendeth it not.&mdash;The plea&s;ing words with which men have amu&s;ed each other, are like &s;iren &s;ongs to lull to &s;leep, and fortify their minds again&s;t fear of that wrath which they may &s;ee pur&s;uing man down to the grave, and may well lead to tremble with fearful apprehen&s;ions of what follows after death. Did men &s;ee their real &s;ituation with regard to their maker, black de&s;pair mu&s;t cover the earth, a&s;ide from the knowledge of him, who &s;ays of him&s;elf, I am the light of the world. The holy &s;criptures which te&s;tify of him, diffu&s;e light abroad, and contain glad tidings of great joy to all &s;orts of people. Ble&s;&s;ed are the people who know the joyful &s;ound, and who while they have the light, believe in the light, that they may be children of light.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SON,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE voice of God in the &s;criptures, is the foun|tain head of all information in religion. If our eyes be turned off from them, to any rea&s;onings of our own, or rea&s;onings of others, they meet nothing but darkne&s;s. While God calls for the &s;ole attention, he points out the danger of its being turned off any where el&s;e. He &s;ays beware of men, and take heed that no man deceive you. The caution is very par|ticular, that there be no man in who&s;e favour you are &s;trongly prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, who &s;hould be &s;uffered to in&s;inuate a thought different from what God has re|vealed. Obedience to this command implies a mo&s;t firm and un&s;haken reliance on the voice of God alone&mdash;As the word of God is the only light, &s;o that alone binds the con&s;cience. So that the con&s;cience of every man living is &s;et at the mo&s;t entire liberty, from every other man in the world, and is &s;ubjected alone to that God with whom he has to do. Tho&s;e who in truth hold divine revelation carry this Motto, Let God be true and every man a liar. They contend for the truth of God at all ri&s;ques though it &s;hould lead to hold their mo&s;t darling friends li|ars. This truth is called the faith once delivered to the &s;aints, for which Chri&s;tians are exhorted ear|ne&s;tly to contend Jude 2. It was once delivered while revelation was compleating, and when that was fini&s;hed, there is no more delivering of it, but the word the delivered is to run through all the Earth as the witne&s;s or record of God. It is &s;aid I John, 5.7, &amp;c. That there are three which bare re|cord in heaven, which three are one, and this wit|ne&s;s of God is &s;aid to be greater than the witne&s;s of men, and 10th ver&s;e, He that believeth not God hath made him a liar, becau&s;e he believeth not the record which God gave of his &s;on. Here is pointed out &s;trongly that God's te&s;timony is more forceable, and carries higher evidence than man's; and that
<PB N="29" REF="032052_0028_0FF0D9DE372BEE90">tho&s;e who do not believe upon his te&s;timony, give God the lie. It is only in holding things revealed true upon God's te&s;timony, that men hold God true; in holding them fal&s;e, they hold God a liar. All knowledge approved of in Scripture comes from God. It is &s;aid, John 6.45, It is written in the prophets they &s;hall all be taught of God, every man therefore that hath heard and learned of the father cometh un|to me. So it is &s;aid of the holy gho&s;t, he &s;hall bring all things to your remembrance, what&s;oever I have &s;aid unto you. It is by revelation that the father teaches, and it is only truth of revelation which the holy Gho&s;t brings to remembrance.</P>
<P>We have the language of the new covenant, Heb. 8.10, 11. I will put my laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts. And they &s;hall not teach every man his neighbour and brother &s;aying, know the Lord, for all &s;hall know me, &amp;c. Here divine rev|elation written in the mind by God him&s;elf is pointed out as the only teaching, in&s;tead of man's teaching.</P>
<P>The Lord in oppo&s;ition to the Phari&s;ees in the 23 <ABBR>d.</ABBR> Mat. 8, 9 ver&s;es &s;ays, But be not ye called Rabbi, for one is your ma&s;ter even Chri&s;t, and all ye are brethren. And call no man father on earth, for one is your father which is in heaven. The Di&s;ciples ca&s;ting their eyes upon the world of Jews and Gen|tiles, &s;aw men at that time as we may &s;ee them now, teaching and taught one of another, in religion (a&s;ide from God's teaching) and placing dependence on one another, as a child upon a father or ma&s;ter. But the Lord will not &s;uffer it to be &s;o among them. There was not a man on earth, whom they were to look up to as a father and ma&s;ter, either to teach or govern in religion. While God alone was to be viewed as a father, and him|&s;elf as a ma&s;ter, they were to think of each other merely as brethren. And no man could be con&s;idered even as a chri&s;tian brother, only as he appeared &s;ubject to the &s;ame father and maker alone. It is added nei|ther be ye called ma&s;ters, &amp;c. 10th v. How far
<PB N="30" REF="032052_0029_0FF0D9E096CBFFA0">they &s;hould be from exerci&s;ing authority over one another we read, Mark 10, 42, 44. After &s;peaking of the great ones among the Gentiles exerci&s;ing au|thority upon them, he &s;ays, &s;o &s;hall it not be among you. Who&s;oever of you will be chiefe&s;t &s;hall be the &s;ervant of all.</P>
<P>The voice of God in the beginning called out di&s;|ciples, and &s;ubjected them to him as a father, and to Chri&s;t as a ma&s;ter, and the di&s;covery of this &s;ubjection in each other, brought them together as brethren, &s;ubject to one father and led them to the mutual of|fices of brotherly love. Thus Churches were rai&s;ed up, and kept together who are called Chri&s;t's &s;heep, and heard his voice, and followed him. Nor are we allowed to think of Chri&s;t's di&s;ciples or churches be|ing made in any other way.</P>
<P>But pretended di&s;ciples are influenced by the voice of man in&s;tead of God's voice. Though they may profe&s;s &s;ome regard for God's word, yet they take their under&s;tanding of Scripture from men, and not from God alone, and the word of God is made of none effect through their tradition. Worldly church|es are brought together by human per&s;ua&s;ion and el|oquence, by the fa&s;hion of the country where they live, by worldly allurements, and in &s;ome ca&s;es by human authority and worldly force; and by the &s;ame means are they kept together. And it is far from their thought that churches can be formed, and held together by the power of the divine word, a&s;ide from human aid. Yet that mu&s;t hold true &s;poken, Zech. 4, 6. Not by might, nor by power, but by my &s;pirit, &s;aith the Lord of ho&s;ts. And we are not allowed to &s;peak of any &s;pirit but what &s;peaks in the &s;criptures. For the Lord &s;ays of the Holy Gho&s;t he &s;hall not &s;peak of him&s;elf&mdash;he &s;hall take of mine and &s;hew it unto you&mdash;and what&s;oever he hears that &s;hall he &s;peak&mdash;and the things which Je&s;us &s;peaks he brings to remembrance. His agency appears to be entirely in and about the &s;criptures. The words of
<PB N="31" REF="032052_0030_0FF0D9E2D03ACCE8">revelation then they are &s;pirit and they are life agree|able to John 6.6, 3.&mdash;The effect of God's teaching in revelation at fir&s;t was to make the di&s;ciples of one heart and one &s;oul. The effect of man's teaching appears, in the diver&s;ity of opinions at this day, and in the language being divided, and confounded, as in the building of Babel. The mi&s;chiefs which have followed man's u&s;urping the place of God in teach|ing and exerci&s;ing authority, are manife&s;t every where, not merely in the mother of Harlots but in her numerous train of pro&s;titute daughters. Human teaching has led mankind to a&s;&s;ociate together in va|rious &s;ects, holding doctrines and ways of their own. Each of their &s;ects hath looked for heads, leaders and teachers, in religion, as in the common arts or profe&s;&s;ions in life; and have trained up youths to a more thorough knowledge of <HI>their</HI> plan of religion, that they may become teachers, and leaders to in|&s;truct others, and defend their faith whatever that faith happens to be. And here is &s;uppo&s;ed to be the fountain head of information; and here it is judged proper to re&s;ort for in&s;truction, as we re&s;ort to men trained up to any art or &s;cience, to get informa|tion about it. It is true this is not the only refort for in&s;truction, for it is common for every man to teach his neighbour and in his turn to be taught by him. In general there is no dependance on any thing el&s;e but human teaching in religion, for though &s;ome individuals profe&s;&s;edly re&s;ort to the &s;criptures, yet it appears that they will have no weight with them again&s;t the peremptory a&s;&s;ertion of a darling teach|er, in whom the highe&s;t confidence is placed.</P>
<P>It is not denied that human teaching has in the concerns of this world contributed greatly to the &s;tock of knowledge. This is manife&s;t in the mecha|nical arts, in navigation, commerce, hu&s;bandry, &amp;c. So exerci&s;ing human authority has had a &s;alutary ef|fect in the &s;ocieties of this world, &s;ecuring life and property and promoting order. But in the concerns
<PB N="32" REF="032052_0031_0FF0D9E4ACC019B8">of that life beyond the grave, they both have had an oppo&s;ire effect.</P>
<P>In the early days of chri&s;tianity, it was agreeable to the natural bias of man's heart, (even as it is now) to thir&s;t for &s;ome teaching be&s;ide God's, and differ|ent from his, and &s;o they heaped to them&s;elves teach|ers, having itching ears who turned them from 'the truth to fables. In like manner they were impatient of being under the entire controul of God in his word, and were de&s;irous that man &s;hould &s;hare the authority with him, and their con&s;ciences became &s;ubjected to human authority. They allowed their bi&s;hops the authority of a father and they were each called Papa, or Pope, in expre&s;s oppo&s;ition to tho&s;e words call no man father on earth. Though the name was confined afterwards to the Bi&s;hop of Rome as the general father, yet all the re&s;t were &s;till ac|counted as having the authority of &s;ubordinate fa|thers.</P>
<P>The Prote&s;tants as the name denotes, have pro|te&s;ted again&s;t &s;ome of the enormities of the Church of Rome; &s;till in general they are fond that man's teaching, &s;hould take the place of God's teaching by his word, and man's rule and authority, &s;hould take the place of his entire &s;way. Indeed their not allow|ing him to &s;peak in his word &s;o that he can be well un|der&s;tood by men of ordinary capacity, at once robs him of his prerogative of teaching &amp; ruling both, for no one can either teach or rule if his words are unintelligible.</P>
<P>Men &s;lattered them&s;elves no doubt when they were departing from the authority of God, in his word that they were aiding his cau&s;e and advancing his kingdom. A grand kingdom has been built up it is true under the chri&s;tian name as is manife&s;t in the Church of Rome, and other national e&s;tabli&s;h|ments. Grand temples have been erected, pom|pous &s;ervices introduced, which in &s;plendor might vie with the ancient pagan temples and &s;ervices, in who&s;e place they came. The&s;e have drawn admira|tion
<PB N="33" REF="032052_0032_0FF0D9E73A16BE28">on earth, but none from him who fled; when they would once have taken him by force, and made him a king. When the Supreme God <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span"> the height of his &s;anctuary, and from heaven beholds the earth, it is not to take plea&s;ure in the pompous parade of the&s;e temples, but it is to hear the groaning of the pri&s;oner and to loo&s;e tho&s;e who are appointed to death, to declare his name in Zion, &amp;c. P&s;alm 102.19, 20. His eye is turned from the&s;e; and his ears are open to a poor wretch though in a dungeon; who dur&s;t not li&s;t up his eyes, but &s;mites upon his brea&s;t crying, God be merciful to me a &s;inner. And where two or three &s;uch are gathered together in his name; there he is in the mid&s;t of them.</P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SON,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>ONE confirmation of the divine truth of the holy Scriptures, is, that inconte&s;tible facts forcibly &s;et forth the &s;ame te&s;timony with the Scriptures, in many in|&s;tances while men practically deny both. I &s;hall on|ly in&s;tance the te&s;timony of both &s;cripture and fact; as to the wi&s;dom of this world in matters of religion, which mankind are bent to make high account of, again&s;t their joint evidence of its vanity. See. 1 Cor. 1.19, 22. It is written I will de&s;troy the wi&s;|dom of the wi&s;e, and bring to nothing the under|&s;tanding of the prudent. Where is the wife? Where is the &s;cribe? Where is the di&s;puter of this world? Hath not God made fooli&s;h the wi&s;dom of this world? For after that in the wi&s;dom of God, the world by wi&s;dom knew not God, it plea&s;ed God by the fool|i&s;hne&s;s of preaching, to &s;ave them who believe, ver. 27. God hath cho&s;en the fooli&s;h things of the world to confound the wi&s;e. 3 chap. 19, 20. The wi&s;dom of this world is fooli&s;hne&s;s with God, for it is written
<PB N="34" REF="032052_0033_0FF0D9EC26C264D0">he taketh the wi&s;e in their own craftine&s;s; and again, the Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wi&s;e, that they are vain, 182. If any man among you &s;eemeth to be wi&s;e, let him become a fool that he may be wi&s;e. The words need no comment. We cannot conceive of language more forceably pouring contempt upon all that wi&s;dom &s;o highly e&s;teemed among men.</P>
<P>This te&s;timony of the Holy Gho&s;t concerning the wi&s;dom of this world, was &s;trikingly illu&s;trated by facts, in the Apo&s;tle's day; and it is not le&s;s &s;o in the pre&s;ent day. The more a per&s;on is informed of the &s;everal religious opinions that have been, or are now in the world, the more full will be his evidence of this truth. The va&s;t variety of &s;ects and plans of religion in the world, which are oppo&s;ite to each o|ther, have been the product of man's wi&s;dom; for in the fir&s;t place they originated from wi&s;e men, who invented and &s;et them afoot, for if each &s;ect was tra|ced to its beginning, it would appear that its foun|der was a wi&s;e man of more than ordinary capacity. Secondly, wi&s;e men have been &s;elected, as teachers, champions, and defenders of them from age to age; and though there may be a difference as to their wi&s;dom, yet the &s;tre&s;s of their defence has been upon men that were the mo&s;t wi&s;e. Thirdly, they have mo&s;tly been under the patronage of civil rulers, who are allowed in general to be of the wife&s;t of the peo|ple; and the&s;e have exerted their power, in connect|ion with the religious teachers, to build up the reli|gion that is in fa&s;hion, among their &s;ubjects, what|ever it may be. In this way, mo&s;t, if not all the &s;ects in religion, have been reared up and &s;upported, con|fronting each other. Thus human wi&s;dom appears in the whole affair, and as it were &s;tands proclaiming its own folly, incon&s;i&s;tency, and contradiction.</P>
<P>Should one apply to the wi&s;e&s;t man in France, or China, or any other country, for information about religion; each of them might appear to an&s;wer wife|ly; but no one a&s;ide from revelation could produce
<PB N="35" REF="032052_0034_0FF0D9EDD25D33D0">more than a mere conjecture, couched in wi&s;dom of words, and probably their an&s;wers would be all con|tradictory.</P>
<P>Human wi&s;dom by cooking the &s;criptures for men's palates, hath not only rai&s;ed up a multitude of &s;ects, called chri&s;tian, but al&s;o hath led them mutually to e&s;teem each other for wi&s;dom, and piety; while hol|ding doctrines and practices oppo&s;ite to each other. They care not what reputation the truth of God has, and it will be &s;uffered to fall in the &s;treet, provided they extract to them&s;elves a name for wi&s;dom and piety, with an ea&s;y living. Here indignation might ri&s;e, but God &s;ays vengeance is mine! We may be &s;ure that truth will prevail, and all its purpo&s;es will be fulfilled. To &s;ome it will be the favour of life unto life, and to others, of death unto death. Hap|py they who are made partakers of its afflictions ac|cording to the power of God, who calls them with an holy calling, according to his own purpo&s;e and grace, given them in Chri&s;t Je&s;us, before the world began.</P>

<P>WE may now turn our attention to the &s;criptures as the only &s;afe guide in religion, and altogether &s;uf|ficient for the grand purpo&s;e of man's &s;alvation. Simon Peter upon a particular occa&s;ion &s;ays, Lord to whom &s;hall we go, thou ha&s;t the words of eternal life. The words of Je&s;us in the &s;criptures are the words of eternal life. How they are &s;o appears Acts 11.14. Who &s;hall tell the words whereby thou and all thy hou&s;e &s;hall be &s;aved. It is &s;aid, the excellency of knowledge is, that wi&s;dom giveth life to them that have it. Eccles. 7.11. It is expre&s;s|ly declared to be life eternal to know the only true God and Je&s;us Chri&s;t whom he has &s;ent, John 17.
<PB N="36" REF="032052_0035_0FF0D9F083955008">This knowledge is conveyed only through the &s;crip|tures. Je&s;us al&s;o prays, &s;anctify them through thy truth, thy word is truth. We are told, P&s;alm 12. 6. The words of the Lord are pure words as &s;ilver tried in a furnace, purified &s;even times. The P&s;alm|i&s;t's 19th P&s;alm, after pointing to the heavens as de|claring the glory of God, and &s;etting before us his handy work, &amp;c. in the 7th ver&s;e, and on, &s;hews the far &s;uperiour light of revelation as perfect; con|verting the &s;oul, making wi&s;e the &s;imple, enlighten|ing the eyes, rejoicing the heart, &amp;c. and then &s;peaks of it as more to be de&s;ired than fine gold, and &s;weet|er than the honey-comb. Upon a certain woman's crying out, ble&s;&s;ed is the womb that bare thee, &amp;c. Je&s;us replies, yea rather ble&s;&s;ed are they that hear the word of God and keep it, Luke 11.28. He rather fixes the ble&s;&s;edne&s;s here, than upon even being the parent of the &s;on of God. The fir&s;t of his parables, that of the &s;ower which is recorded by three evangeli&s;ts and clo&s;es with this cry, he that hath ears to hear let him hear, points out that as the harve&s;t origi|nates from the &s;eed ca&s;t into the ground &s;o his own harve&s;t which was to be gathered in at la&s;t, would all originate from that &s;eed the word of God. So that whatever is great, good, or de&s;irable in his king|dom ri&s;es from that &s;eed the word of God. He how|ever &s;hews that where it is not under&s;tood, is catch|ed away by Satan, or is choaked with cares, the &s;eed is made of none effect. It is &s;aid Jam. 1.18, of his own will begat he us with the <HI>word</HI> of truth, &amp;c and 2.12. Wherefore lay apart all filthine&s;s, &amp;c. and receive with meekne&s;s the <HI>engrafted word</HI> which is <HI>able</HI> to &s;ave your &s;ouls. It is well known that a graft in&s;erted in a thorn bu&s;h will bear fruit parta|king of its own nature, and not that of the thorn: So the word of God engrafted, bears fruit as it is &s;aid, Colo&s;&s;. 1.6. That the word of the truth of the Go&s;pel bringeth forth fruit. They are &s;aid to be begotten by it, and it is expre&s;sly &s;aid to be <HI>able</HI> to
<PB N="37" REF="032052_0036_0FF0D9F3A3144D08">&s;ave the &s;oul.&mdash;The Apo&s;tle Peter &s;peaks of the &s;aints as being born again of incorruptible &s;eed by the <HI>word of God</HI> which liveth and abideth forever. He then &s;peaks of all fle&s;h as gra&s;s, and all the glory of man as the flower of gra&s;s, but the word of the Lord endureth forever, and this is the word which by the Go&s;pel is preached unto you while all fle&s;h turns to corruption, and all their glory withers, the word of the Go&s;pel is held forth for dying man to confide in, as everliving, and able to give him life, though he finds his fle&s;h and his heart are failing. How excel|lent this word!</P>
<P>The Apo&s;tle &s;ays of Timothy, that from a child, he had known the holy &s;criptures which are able to make wi&s;e to &s;alvation, and then adds, all &s;cripture is given by in&s;piration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for in&s;truction in righteou&s;ne&s;s; that the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furni&s;hed unto all good works, 2 Tim. 3.15, 17. At parting with the elders at Ephe&s;us he &s;ays, Acts 20.32. And now brethren I com|mend you to God, and to the <HI>word</HI> of his grace, which is able to build you up and give you an inhe|ritance among all them who are &s;anctified, &amp;c. We may notice three expre&s;&s;ions quoted above, James &s;ays it is able to &s;ave the &s;oul. The pa&s;&s;age from Timothy &s;ays, it is able to make wi&s;e to &s;alvation, this la&s;t quoted &s;ays, it is able to build up and give the inheritance, &amp;c. They are full to one purpo&s;e. And the Apo&s;tle commends his brethren only to God and this word as all-&s;ufficient. There had been no &s;afety in commending to any man, however eminent, or to his own &s;trength, or any thing under the &s;un but the word of God's grace.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid, Deut. 8.3. And he humbled thee, &amp;c. that he might make thee know that man doth not live by bread alone, but by <HI>every word</HI> that pro|ceedeth out of the mouth of the Lord, doth man live. Je&s;us in reply to the tempter quotes the&s;e
<PB N="38" REF="032052_0037_0FF0D9F7912E2D98">words, Mat. 4.4. The end of I&s;rael's &s;evere trials, was to bring to this point of knowledge, that God's word was their life, and as man's natural life mu&s;t fail without &s;u&s;tenance, &s;o his life beyond the grave mu&s;t fail but for the word of God. Agreeably we read the ju&s;t or ju&s;tified &s;hall live by faith or through the truth believed. The grandeur of the &s;ubject &s;eems to forbid de&s;cending to any particular notice of the length men have run in vilifying this word, which one would think &s;carcely po&s;&s;ible had he not daily evidence &s;et before him.</P>
<P>One text more may be noticed, I&s;. 55.10, 11, 12. For as the rain cometh down and the &s;now from heaven, and returneth not thither again but watereth the earth and maketh it bring forth and bud, that it may give &s;eed to the &s;ower and bread to the eater, &s;o &s;hall my word be which goeth out of my mouth, it &s;hall not return to me void, but it &s;hall accompli&s;h that which I plea&s;e, and it &s;hall pro&s;per in the thing whereto I &s;ent it. Here we are reminded who&s;e mouth it proceeds from to in&s;pire with awe: it is cloathed with the authority of him who &s;peaks. A|gain it is like the rain, which fails not to clothe the earth with verdure, and furni&s;h &s;u&s;tenance for man and bea&s;t, mini&s;tering life and vigour. All the ver|dure, life, and vigour of Chri&s;t's kingdom ari&s;es from the word of his mouth. And this word doth not re|turn to him void, like a me&s;&s;enger unable to perform his errand; but fully accompli&s;hes the purpo&s;e for which it is &s;ent forth. It effects all that God de&s;ign|ed that it &s;hould on the earth.</P>
<P>The word from the &s;ame mouth at fir&s;t &s;aid, let their be light, and failed not of producing it. It &s;aid al&s;o, let the earth bring forth gra&s;s, and herb, yielding &s;eed and the fruit tree yielding fruit, who&s;e &s;eed is in it&s;elf, after his kind, and its force continues in vegetation from year to year; as al&s;o the &s;ource of that word be fruitful and multiply and repleni&s;h the earth, continues renewing the face of the earth, though
<PB N="39" REF="032052_0038_0FF0D9F934EDB690">one generation pa&s;&s;eth away, after another. So his word in the &s;criptures hath had, and &s;till will have its full effect, in gathering in all his cho&s;en people, that not one be lo&s;t. And though an apo&s;tle may be bound, yet the word of God is not bound. Yea tho&s;e things which appear like checking its progre&s;s, often turn out to the furtherance of it. It hath its free cour&s;e, and makes its way through gates of bra&s;s, and bars of iron. Without human aid it will triumph over all the force of men and the powers of hell.</P>
<P>Its effects are not &s;plendid in this world, in the eyes of tho&s;e who like the Jews, are thinking of a temporal kingdom for the Me&s;&s;iah. The king|dom formed by it, cometh not with ob&s;ervation. A brui&s;ed reed and the &s;moking flax are fit emblems of it. But hereafter it will appear conformable to him, who though once crucified in weakne&s;s &s;hall appear in his glory as the only potentate, the King of Kings and Lord of Lords. Paint mu&s;t be our conception of the &s;plendor of his kingdom at that day, when tho&s;e whom he calls his &s;heep, who hear his voice, and follow him, in &s;ufferings; are all ga|thered together in one general a&s;&s;embly, to &s;hare in his glory, and &s;hall appear as one grand royal family, crowned with glory and honor and immortality. Then the i&s;&s;ue of hearing God's voice in the &s;crip|tures will be &s;trikingly manife&s;t, while this world is &s;moaking in ruins.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER VIII.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SON,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SUNDRY &s;triking pa&s;&s;ages of Scripture upon the energy of God's word were omitted in my la&s;t, which I will mention in this, and fini&s;h with &s;ome remarks upon the re&s;i&s;tance the truth has met with in the world.&mdash;It is &s;aid, Jer. 23.29. Is not my word like as a fire, &s;aith the Lord? and like a hammer that breaketh the rock in pieces? Heb. 4.12. For the word of God is quick (or living) and powerful and &s;harper than any two-edged &s;word, piercing even to the dividing a&s;under of &s;oul and &s;pirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a di&s;cerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart. It is &s;aid of numbers who received it that they were pricked in their heart. While it gives a deadly &s;tab, it conveys a &s;alutary bal&s;am. While it demoli&s;hes the hopes of man, it pre&s;ents a grand rea&s;on of hope through the blood of Je&s;us.&mdash;Its force as the grand weapon of the Apo&s;tle is expre&s;&s;ed, 2 Cor. 10.4. For the wea|pons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty through God; to the pulling down &s;trong holds, ca&s;ting down rea&s;onings and every high thing which exal|teth it&s;elf again&s;t the knowledge of God, bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Chri&s;t.&mdash;This brings to mind the idea of a &s;trong fortre&s;s demoli&s;hed by powerful artillery. Mighty were the effects of God's word in the Apo&s;tle's days. It came not in word only but in power and in the holy gho&s;t, and in much a&s;&s;urance. It wrought effec|tually in them. They turned from idols to God, to &s;erve the living God and wait for his &s;on from hea|ven, 1 The&s;&s;. 1.9, 10. The cour&s;e of the whole could of witne&s;&s;es mentioned Heb. 11th chap. and the cour&s;e of their followers under the new te&s;tament was oppo&s;ite to the cour&s;e of this world and to the bias of their own hearts. They were influenced by the word of God and &s;omething &s;upernatural appears in their cour&s;e all one way, as if a &s;tream &s;hould turn about and run towards its &s;ource.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="032052_0040_0FF0D9FEB6E6D710">
The two witne&s;&s;es which prophecy 1260 days, cloathed in &s;ackcloth, called the two olive trees, and the two candle&s;ticks &s;tanding before the God of the whole earth appear to be the old and new te&s;tament, and it is &s;aid if any man hurt them, fire proceedeth out of their mouth and devoureth their enemies, and they have power to &s;hut heaven, that it rain not in the days of their prophecy to turn water to blood and to &s;mite the earth with plagues as often as they will, as God's word of old did by Mo&s;es, &s;ee Rev. 11.3, 7. The fulfilment of their prophecy particularly un|der the &s;even trumpets and &s;even vials is &s;miting the earth with plagues, and in the ju&s;t judgment of God falls on tho&s;e who received not the love of the truth. Their &s;hutting heaven that it rain not in the days of their prophecy appears to point to the &s;ame thing mentioned Rev. 7.1, under the &s;imilitude of holding the four winds of the earth, the con&s;equence of which is dearth and de&s;truction. As to fire proceeding out of their mouth and devouring their enemies, it leads us to think of the la&s;t effect of the &s;criptures up|on tho&s;e who abu&s;e them, and reminds of what Je&s;us &s;ays, John 12.18. He that rejecteth me and re|ceiveth not my words hath one that judgeth him; the word that I have &s;poken, the &s;ame &s;hall judge him at the la&s;t day. Here we &s;ee the power of the &s;upreme judge as it were attributed to the word of God in the la&s;t awful deci&s;ion. Then their threatnings will bur&s;t forth like fire which had been long concealed, vom|ited from their mouth, and it will appear that heaven and earth &s;hall &s;ooner pa&s;s away than one jot or tittle of them &s;hall fail.&mdash;The conclu&s;ion of the whole book of revelation points out the cur&s;es of the man that &s;hall dare to add to or take from the words of God, Rev. 22.18, 19.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid, P&s;alm 138.2. Thou ha&s;t magnified thy word above all thy name. The voice of the Lord is indeed powerful and full of maje&s;ty. His word called up the heavens and earth into exi&s;tence,
<PB N="42" REF="032052_0041_0FF0DA0232AB8EC0">Heb. 11.3. And the heavens and earth which are now by the &s;ame word are kept in &s;tore re&s;erved unto fire, 2 Pet. 3.7. And the hour is coming when all that are in their graves &s;hall hear his voice and come forth to the re&s;urrection of life, or re&s;ur|rection of damnation. John 5.28, 29.&mdash;God's voice in the &s;criptures is from the &s;ame mouth, and deems it no u&s;urpation to be counted equal with that voice which rai&s;es the dead.</P>
<P>The &s;tate of mankind as to believing this holy word, is not unlike that of the Jews, who under clear evidence came round Je&s;us &s;aying, how long do&s;t thou make us to doubt, if thou be the Chri&s;t tell us plainly.</P>
<P>However light the &s;cripture is accounted among men, yet Je&s;us Chri&s;t is &s;aid to tremble at this word. For thus &s;peaks he who&s;e throne is the heaven, If. 66.2. To this man will I look to him who is poor and of a contrite &s;pirit, and <HI>trembleth at my word.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg">This pa&s;&s;age mu&s;t be under&s;tood to refer to Je&s;us Chri&s;t in whom alone God is well plea&s;ed.</NOTE> And as to tho&s;e who tremble at the &s;ame word in conformity to him it is &s;aid, 5th ver&s;e, Hear the word of the Lord ye that <HI>tremble at his word,</HI> your brethren who hated you and ca&s;t you out for my names &s;ake &s;aid, let the Lord be glorified, but he &s;hall appear to your joy and they &s;hall be a&s;hamed. Je&s;us declares, Mark 8.38, that whoever is a&s;hamed of his words, of him he will be a&s;hamed when he comes in his glory. The Saints in every age, afraid of their own lu&s;ts under the &s;pecious &s;hew of rea&s;on, have thought them&s;elves bound to believe what they are told by God, and to do as they are bidden by him, wiithout adding or dimini&s;hing, avoiding vain rea&s;onings. They have been from age to age in the mid&s;t of an adulterous generation, who under a boa&s;t of rea&s;on have always re&s;i&s;ted the truth. And no doubt but that a boa&s;t of rea&s;on hath run through
<PB N="43" REF="032052_0042_0FF0DA0410636388">the whole re&s;i&s;tance it hath met with from infidels and corrupters of the truth, whether we think of Pharaoh, Korah and company, the I&s;raelites propo&s;ing a cap|tain to lead back to Egypt, or oppo&s;ed to the report of the &s;pies, or the whole re&s;i&s;tance in the wilderne&s;s and Canaan, by men of their own body or nations round them. No doubt but that the Jews boa&s;ted of rea|&s;on in all their perver&s;e cavils again&s;t Je&s;us, under the light of &s;triking miracles, and in putting him to death. The &s;ame is true as to men's conduct to|wards the Apo&s;tles. The &s;ame is true as to the church of Rome profe&s;&s;ing to hold the word of God &s;acred, and yet making it of no effect through their traditions (as the Jews had done before) in whom was found the blood of many who were &s;lain for the <HI>word of God.</HI> So at this day while multitudes pro|fe&s;s to hold the &s;criptures to be the word of God, they openly deny its plaine&s;t truths, even that Je&s;us Chri&s;t is the &s;on of God&mdash;that there is &s;alvation in no other&mdash;and that he who believeth not &s;hall be damned, contrary to plain a&s;&s;ertions of the holy Gho&s;t. The boa&s;ted light of rea&s;on has been the dictates of their own lu&s;ts, and not the light of their con&s;cience. As to &s;uch unhappy men, the Apo&s;tle &s;ays, 2 Cor. 4.3, 4. But if our go&s;pel be hid, it is hid to them who are lo&s;t. In whom the God of this world hath blind|ed the minds of them who believe not, le&s;t the light of the glorious go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, who is the image of God, &s;hould &s;hine unto them. They &s;tumble at the &s;tumbling &s;tone laid in Zion. They &s;tumble at the <HI>word,</HI> being di&s;obedient, whereunto al&s;o they are ap|pointed 1 Pet. 2.8. The fearful lengths men have gone, are a fulfilment of &s;everal prophecies, particularly 2 The&s;s. 2 chap. which foretels the ri&s;e of fal&s;e chri&s;ti|anity under the energy of Satan, and that for this cau&s;e God &s;hall &s;end them &s;trong delu&s;ions that they &s;hould believe a lie, that they all might be damned who believed not the truth, but had plea&s;ure in un|righteou&s;ne&s;s, &s;ee 2.11, 12 v. Here is al&s;o mention
<PB N="44" REF="032052_0043_0FF0E33225C69FB0">that this man of &s;in &s;hould be de&s;troyed by the brightne&s;s of his coming. And from prophetic com|putation it appears, that the time of the &s;econd vi&s;it of Je&s;us is not far di&s;tant, when we are a&s;&s;ured it &s;hall be as it was in the days of Noah and in the days of Lot. It becomes tho&s;e who have an ear to hear him &s;aying, behold I come as a thief, and to bear in mind that exhortation, Heb. 2.1, 5. Therefore we ought to give the more earne&s;t heed to the things we have heard le&s;t at any time we let them &s;lip. For if the word &s;poken by Angels was &s;tedfa&s;t, and every tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ion received a ju&s;t recompence of reward. How &s;hall we e&s;cape if we neglect &s;o great &s;alvation, which at the fir&s;t began to be &s;poken by the Lord, and was confirmed to us by them who heard him; God al&s;o bearing witne&s;s both with &s;igns and wonders, and with divers miracles and gifts of the holy Gho&s;t ac|cording to his own will.</P>
