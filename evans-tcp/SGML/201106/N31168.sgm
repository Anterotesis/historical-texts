</EPIGRAPH>
<P>_THE Return of this blooming Sea|&s;on of the Year puts me in Mind of my Duty towards my young Friends in this Congregation; tho&s;e growing Shoots, tho&s;e bloom|ing Flowers of human Nature.&mdash; To you therefore, my dear Youth, I would now addre&s;s my&s;elf: And would do it with all the Tenderne&s;s of a fatherly Heart.</P>
<P>AMONG you, I hope, I &s;hall not meet with Di&s;couragement, of the &s;amd king, which I often meet with in my Addre&s;&s;es to others. Among you, I hope, I &s;hall not find any Veterans in Sin, confirmed and hardened in Wickedne&s;s by a long Practice; though, alas! we &s;ometimes meet with the &s;hocking Curio&s;ity of one young in Years, but old in Sin. Among you, I hope
<PB N="4" REF="041259_0003_101A6817E7337A08">to find that Tenderne&s;s of Heart, and tho&s;e &s;oft impre&s;&s;ible Pa&s;&s;ions, which are &s;o peculiar to your Age, and which may render you more &s;u&s;ceptive of religious Impre&s;&s;ions, than tho&s;e who&s;e Hearts are at once hardened by Age. and by a long Habit of Sinning; the&s;e Circum&s;tances afford me Encouragement. But alas! even among you, &s;oft and pliable as you are, I ex|pect great Di&s;couragements, tho' of another Kind. You are gay, merry and thoughtle&s;s; and cannot bear to fix your Thoughts upon &s;uch di&s;agreeable Subjects; and flatter your&s;elves it is time enough for you to &s;ubmit to the Mortifi|cation of attending to them, as you advance farther in Life. Your Pa&s;&s;ions and Appetites are &s;trong and unruly: Your Hopes warm and &s;anguine. And therefore I am afraid &s;undry of you will hardly allow me a &s;erious Hearing, tho' our for an Hour. However, whether you hear, or whether you forbear, I mu&s;t endeavour to de|liver my Me&s;&s;age to you, in the Name of God.</P>
<P>IT is a very encouraging Thought, that the ble&s;&s;ed Je&s;us has a very tender Regard for &s;uch young Creatures. This he &s;hewed in his warm Re&s;entment again&s;t tho&s;e that would have kept them from his Arms, while he dwelt among Men.</P>
<P>SOME of his Friends brought their young Children to him, that he might touch them, or lay his Hands upon them, as a Sign of his ble&s;|&s;ing them, after the Manner of the Patriarchs and Prophets, in their &s;olemn Benedictions. But his Di&s;ciples, thinking it beneath the Dignity
<PB N="5" REF="041259_0004_101A681A96969F90">of &s;o great and divine a Prophet, to be troubled and teazed with little Children; and appre|hending that &s;uch thoughtle&s;s Creatures could receive no Advantage from him, rebuked their Parents, and would have &s;ent them away. This mu&s;t be a very affecting Di&s;couragement to Parents to find them&s;elves forbid to come to Chri&s;t, and that by his Di&s;ciples, who ought to have intro|duced them, and encouraged their Application. <HI>But when Je&s;us &s;aw</HI> the dear little Creatures &s;ent away from him, <HI>he was greatly di&s;plea&s;ed.</HI> If good Men thro' Mi&s;take, and bad Men thro' ob&s;tinate Wickedne&s;s di&s;courage the&s;e young Immortals in coming to Chri&s;t, he him&s;elf is willing they &s;hould come, and warmly re&s;ents it, when any Hin|drance is thrown in their Way. This gracious Shepherd takes &s;pecial Care of the Weak and Young in his Flock; he <Q>gathers the Lambs in his Arms, and carries them in his Bo&s;om.</Q> Hence he tells his Di&s;ciples and all around him, <Q>Suffer the little Children to come unto me, and forbid them not.</Q> They are all welcome to my Arms: And the little Sinners &s;tand in need of a Saviour.</P>
<P>WHEN he &s;ays, <Q><HI>Suffer</HI> them to come, and <HI>forbid them not,</HI></Q> he does not mean, meerly, that they &s;hould not <HI>hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">der</HI> or di&s;courage them; but he means, that they &s;hould <HI>po&s;itively a&s;&s;i&s;t</HI> and encourage them to come to him; and that Pa|rents &s;hould be &s;o far from hindering them, that they &s;hould b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ing them them&s;elves.</P>
<P>THIS <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> particularly addre&s;&s;ed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">, and through them, to all the
<PB N="6" REF="041259_0005_101A681D0E876028">Mini&s;ters of the Go&s;pel. And I feel its Obligation binding me in particular to this agreeable Duty. Indeed the lovely Forms, the Blooms of Rea&s;on, and the engaging little Actions of tho&s;e amiable Creatures, whom I now addre&s;s, might win the Affection even of a &s;tranger, and excite him to perform every kind Office in his Bower for them.</P>
<P>OUR Saviour adds a Rea&s;on why he would have little Children &s;uffered to come to him, which is, <Q>For of &s;uch is the Kingdom of Hea|ven.</Q> This may be under&s;tood in two Sen&s;es. It may either &s;ignify the Go&s;pel Church, which is often called <HI>the Kingdom of Heaven,</HI> and even the heavenly Church con&s;i&s;ts of &s;uch little Chil|dren as the&s;e: Such little Creatures are admitted as Members into this divine Society, and are entitled to its Privileges. And therefore, <Q>Chri&s;tian Parents ought to bring them to me; and it is their Duty to come as &s;oon as they are capable of acting. Therefore forbid them not, but encourage them.</Q> Or it may &s;ignify the Church of God, both in its earthly and heavenly State, con&s;i&s;ts of <HI>&s;uch Per&s;ons;</HI> that is, of Per&s;ons, who re&s;emble little Children in Tem|per; who, like them are humble, meek, pliable, forgiving, ea&s;ily appea&s;ed, teachable. I rather chu&s;e this Sen&s;e, becau&s;e the Connection &s;eems to lead to it; for the very next Words are, <Q>Verily I &s;ay unto you, who&s;oever &s;hall not receive the Kingdom of God as a little Child, he &s;hall not enter therein.</Q> This is al&s;o agree|able to what he &s;ays el&s;ewhere, when he makes a little Child an Emblem of the Chri&s;tian
<PB N="7" REF="041259_0006_101A681E9B69FD78">Temper. (<HI>Matt.</HI> xviii, 2, 3, 4.) <Q>Je&s;us called a little Child unto him, and &s;et him in the mid&s;t of them, and &s;aid, Verily I &s;ay unto you, except ye be converted, and become as <HI>little Children,</HI> ye &s;hall not enter into the Kingdom of Heaven. Who&s;oever therefore &s;hall hum|ble him&s;elf as this <HI>little Child,</HI> the &s;ame is greate&s;t in the Kingdom of Heaven.</Q> In this View the Argument is conclu&s;ive: For if Children have &s;ome Di&s;po&s;itions, in which even Men mu&s;t re&s;emble and imitate them, before they can enter into the Kingdom of Heaven; then certainly Children are capable of being brought to Je&s;us, and it is their Duty to come to him.</P>
<P>You &s;ee, my dear Children and Youth, that you have a Right, and that it is your Duty, to come to Je&s;us. Therefore, oh! come to him: Come to him this very Day, without Delay.</P>
<P>BUT here, I hope, you &s;tart a very proper Que&s;tion, <Q>What is it to come to Chri&s;t? or, in what Sen&s;e are we to under&s;tand this Phra&s;e, as it may be applied to us now, &s;ince he is re|moved from our World?</Q></P>
<P>COMING to Chri&s;t, in my Text, did indeed mean a bodily Motion to him: And this was practicable, while he tabernacled in Fle&s;h among Men. But even then, it &s;ignified much <HI>more.</HI> It &s;ignified coming to him as a divine Teacher, to receive In&s;truction; as a Saviour, to obtain eternal Life; and as the only Mediator. through whom guilty Sinners might have Acce&s;s to God. It &s;ignified a Motion of Soul towards him, cor|re&s;pondent to the bodily Motion of coming: A
<PB N="8" REF="041259_0007_101A68205C71B148">Motion of the De&s;ires, a Flight of tender Affec|tions towards him. In this View it is &s;till prac|ticable to come to Christ; and it is our Duty in the&s;e latter Da<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s, as much as it was theirs who were his Contemporaries upon Earth. It is in this View I now urge it upon you: And in this View it includes the following Particulars:</P>
<P N="1">1. A clear Conviction of Sin; of Sin in Heart, in Word, and in Practice; of Sin again&s;t Know|ledge; again&s;t alluring Mercies and fatherly Corrections; of Sin again&s;t all the &s;tronge&s;t Ties to Duty. Without &s;uch a Conviction of Sin, it is impo&s;&s;ible you &s;hould fly to him as a Saviour: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> <Q>came not to call the Righteous, but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> Repentance.</Q></P>
<P N="2">2. AN affecting Sen&s;e of Danger, upon the Account of Sin. You cannot fly to him as a Saviour, till you &s;ee your extreme Need of Salvation; and you cannot &s;o your Need of Salvation. till you are &s;en&s;ible or your Danger; &s;en&s;ible that you are every Moment liable to everla&s;ting Condemnation, and have no Title at all to the divine Favour.</P>
<P N="3">3. AN humbling Sen&s;e of your own Inability to &s;ave your&s;elves by the Merit of your own be&s;t Endeavours. I do not mean, that you &s;hould neglect your be&s;t Endeavours; or that you &s;hould not exert your utmo&s;t Strength in every good Work, and in the earne&s;t U&s;e of all the Means of Grace: For you never will come to Chri&s;t, till you are brought to this. But I mean that while you are doing your utmo&s;t, you mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible, that you do not de&s;erve any Favour at
<PB N="9" REF="041259_0008_101A6823AB6A0F38">all from God on that Account, and that you neither can nor do make any Atonement for your Sins by all your good Works; but that God may ju&s;tly condemn you notwith&s;tanding. Till you are &s;en&s;ible of this, you will weary your&s;elves in vain, in idle &s;elf-righteous Efforts to perform the Work which Je&s;us came into the World to per|form, and which he alone was able to do; I mean, to make Atonement for your Sin, and to work out a Righteou&s;ne&s;s to recommend you to God. It is an eternal Truth, that you will never come to Chri&s;t as a Saviour, till you are deeply &s;en&s;ible there is no Salvation in any other; and particularly that you are not able to &s;ave your&s;elves.</P>
<P N="4">4. AN affecting Conviction, that Je&s;us Chri&s;t is a glorious, all &s;ufficient, and willing Saviour: that his Righteou&s;ne&s;s is perfect. equal to all the Demands of the divine Law, and &s;ufficient to make Satisfaction for all our Sins, and procure for us all the Ble&s;&s;ings of the divine Favour; that he is able and willing to <Q><HI>&s;ave to the utter|mo&s;t all thut come unto God by him,</HI></Q> and that he is freely offered in the Go&s;pel to all that will accept him, however unworthy, and however great their Sins. Indeed it is an eternal Truth, that though Multitudes peri&s;h, it is not for want of a Saviour. There is a Saviour all &s;ufficient, and perfectly willing; and this you mu&s;t be con|vinced of before you can come to him.</P>
<P N="5">5. AN entire Dependance upon his Merits alone for Acceptance with God. Sen&s;ible that you have no Merit of your own, on which to
<PB N="10" REF="041259_0009_101A682537E12918">depend; and &s;en&s;ible al&s;o that Je&s;us is a &s;ure Foundation, on which you may &s;afely venture your eternal All, you mu&s;t ca&s;t all your Depen|dance and fix your entire Tru&s;t on Him. You will as it were hang about him, as the only Sup|port for your &s;inking Soul, and plead his Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s as the only Ground of your Acceptance with God. This is &s;o unnatural to a proud &s;elf-confident Sinner, that you mu&s;t be brought very low indeed, throughly mortified and &s;elf-emptied, before you will &s;ubmit to it.</P>
<P N="6">6. A chearful Subjection to Him as your Ruler; and a voluntary Surrender of your&s;elves to his Service. If you come to Him at all, it will be as poor penitent Rebels, returning to Duty, with Shame and Sorrow, and fully determined never to depart from it more. To embrace Chri&s;t as a Saviour, and yet not &s;ubmit to Him as our Ruler; to tru&s;t in his Righteou&s;ne&s;s, and in the mean time di&s;obey his Authority; this is the greate&s;t Ab&s;urdity, and utterly incon&s;i&s;tent with the wi&s;e Con&s;titution of the Go&s;pel.</P>
<P>AND now, my dear young Friends, I hope even your tender Minds have &s;ome Ideas what it is to come to Chri&s;t. And therefore, when I exhort you to it, you know what I mean. Come then, come to Je&s;us: Ye little tender Lambs, come to the great Shepherd of I&s;rael who loves to crrry &s;uch as you in his Bo&s;om. Come, deeply &s;en&s;ible of your Sins. Young a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> you are, you have been guilty of Sins beyond Number. You have &s;poken many bad Words, you have been peevi&s;h, &s;ullen; angry, ob&s;tinate,
<PB N="11" REF="041259_0010_101A682736C25750">di&s;obedient to Parents, wild, thoughtle&s;s, and too full of Play. And which is wor&s;e than all, you have bad Hearts. Mu&s;t they not be very bad Hearts, that are &s;o little inclined to think of the great God, and love Him, who made you a few Years ago, and who has ever &s;ince been be&s;tow|ing a thou&s;and ble&s;&s;ings upon you every Day? Mu&s;t they not be very bad Hearts, that are &s;o little inclined, or rather &s;o aver&s;e, to Prayer, to Reading, and to the Service of God in general? That are &s;o unwilling to think &s;eriou&s;ly of God and Eternity? That are &s;o &s;trongly inclined to Sin, and childi&s;h Follies and Vanities? You can|not but know, my dear young Creatures, that this is your Ca&s;e; and therefore, believe it, you are Sinners, great Sinners. Yes, tho' your Forms are lovely, and your pretty little Actions very engaging, yet you are very guilty Creatures. Therefore come to Je&s;us as <HI>Sinners.</HI></P>
<P>COME al&s;o <HI>&s;en&s;ible of your Danger.</HI> Believe it, while you have no Intere&s;t in Chri&s;t, while you do not love God, and delight in his Service, you are in Danger every Moment of Falling into Hell. The Threatnings of the Law of God are in full Force again&s;t you. The great God is ju&s;tly angry with you every Day. The Lions of Hell are going about &s;eeking to devour you. You have no Title to Heaven, and no Security of the pre&s;ent Life. Children and Youth die, you know, as well as the Aged, Yes the cold Hand of Death may &s;eize you, lively, gay and merry as you are. And oh! WHERE are YOU THEN? Therefore come to Je&s;us as peri&s;hing
<PB N="12" REF="041259_0011_101A6834F3BE0C48">Sinners, deeply &s;en&s;ible of your Danger. Come to Him, as a drowning Man catches at a Plank or Rope to &s;ave him. Cry to Him, <Q>Save me, Lord; I peri&s;h. I &s;tand upon the &s;l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ppery Brink of Ruin, ready every Moment to tumble in. Oh! &s;tretch out thy Hand and &s;ave me.</Q></P>
<P>COME to him deeply <HI>&s;en&s;ible of your own utter Helple&s;&s;ne&s;s.</HI> Pray, read, repent, attend upon all the Means of Grace; do every good Work. But de&s;pair of ever &s;aving your&s;elves by the Merits of the&s;e Things. Be &s;en&s;ible that all your Righteou&s;ne&s;&s;es are but as filthy Rags: that after you have done all, you are but unprofitable Servants, and de&s;erve no Reward at all from God. While you are full of your&s;elves, &s;elf-&s;ufficient and pre&s;umptuous, you can never come to Chri&s;t. And oh! that you might this Day obtain a ju&s;t View of your lo&s;t and helple&s;s Situ|ation in your&s;elves! Even then, you would have no Ground for De&s;pair: For tho' you are help|le&s;s in your&s;elves, yet <Q>God hath la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">d Help for you upon One that is mighty.</Q> Therefore,</P>
<P>COME to Je&s;us as an <HI>all-glorious, all-&s;ufficient and willing Saviour.</HI> Oh! that you did but &s;ee his infinite <HI>Glory</HI> and <HI>Beauty!</HI> Then I need &s;peak no more to you, you would of your&s;elves give your&s;elves up to him forever. Your Hearts would be in&s;tantaneou&s;ly captivated by his irre&s;i&s;tible Charms. Oh! that you were but &s;en&s;ible of his <HI>All-&s;ufficiency!</HI> then you would no more he&s;itate and doubt whether you might venture your eter|nal All into his Ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">. You would be fully
<PB N="13" REF="041259_0012_101A6828CA291AD0">convinced that you might mo&s;t &s;ecurely tru&s;t Him with ten thou&s;and Souls, if you had them. Oh! that you were &s;en&s;ible, how <HI>willing</HI> he is to &s;ave you! you would no longer doubt whether he would receive &s;uch guilty Creatures as you. Can you hear him declare over and over, "Him that con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">eth to me. I will in no wi&s;e ca&s;t out."

Believe it, He is willing, He is eagerly de&s;irous to receive the Vile&s;t and mo&s;t Guilty among you, if you are but willing to come to Him. Therefore come to Him, as to an all-glorious, all-&s;ufficient, and mo&s;t willing Saviour.</P>
<P>COME to Him al&s;o with a <HI>full Dependance up|on Him</HI> for Acceptance with God, and every Ble&s;&s;ing. Tru&s;t in Him, though He &s;hould &s;lay you. Venture your All upon Him. Lean upon Him, as you are coming out of this Wilderne&s;s. Renounce all Dependance upon your own Righ|teou&s;ne&s;s, Build no longer upon that Quick|&s;and, or you &s;ink forever. But behold, God has <Q>laid in Zion for a Foundation a Stone, a tried Stone, a precious Corner-&s;tone, a &s;ure Foun|dation;</Q> and here you may &s;afely build the high Fabric of your immortal Hopes.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="041259_0013_101A68371A4AC238">
FINALLY: Come to Him as to <HI>your Ruler and King.</HI> Yield your&s;elves willing Subjects to his Laws for the future. Let every Thought become a willing Captive to Him. Let his Will be your Rule. Let his Law regulate your Tem|per and Conduct; direct you to what you &s;hould love and hate. what you &s;hould de&s;ire and avoid; what you &s;hould do and forbear.</P>
<P>THUS come to Je&s;us Chri&s;t, my dear young Creatures, and he will certainly receive you into the Arms of his Favour; and there he will bear you &s;afe through this World, till he lodge you forever in his ble&s;&s;ed Bo&s;om.

And it is in the U&s;e of your be&s;t Endeavours, and in that Way only, that you have any Rea&s;on to expect the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of divine Grace to enable you.</P>
<P>THEREFORE, come, come!

"O &s;uffer your little Children to come to Je&s;us, and "forbid them not."&mdash;Forbid them not, by your own Examples. Let them not &s;ee you neglect Je&s;us Chri&s;t your&s;elves, and going on is Sin: For this will be the greate&s;t Hindrance you can ca&s;t in their Way. Forbid them not, by di&s;couraging the Appearances of Thoughtful|ne&s;s, and &s;erious Impre&s;&s;ions on their tender Minds.&mdash;Forbid them not, by flattering them with fal&s;e Hopes, and healing their Wound &s;light|ly, &s;peaking Peace to them without good Rea&s;on; but endeavour to make them &s;en&s;ible of their Sin|fulne&s;s and Danger, and their extreme Need of a Saviour; of the Difficulty of Conver&s;ion, and a Cour&s;e of &s;trict Religion: in &s;hort, let them know the Truth of their Ca&s;e.</P>
<P>I told you before, that this Prohibition "forbid them not," implies an Injunction po&s;itively to encourage and a&s;&s;i&s;t them in coming to Chri&s;t. Therefore, Parents, do all you can by In&s;truction, by Example, by Prayer to God, and by every Means in your Power, to bring your dear Chil|dren to Chri&s;t. Remember He hath laid his Commands upon you; and dare you di&s;obey, e&s;pecially, when the &s;ame Duty is inforced upon you by the &s;tronge&s;t Ties of Nature?</P>
<P>BUT I return to you. my young Friends, to who&s;e Service I have devoted this Hour. And my la&s;t Motive to you derived from the Text is,</P>
<P N="3">3. "Of &s;uch is the Kingdom of Heaven." This, I told you, may be taken in two Sen&s;es; and in both it may be a &s;trong Inducement to you to come to Chri&s;t.</P>

IF the Meaning be, that the Church of God con&s;i&s;ts of Per&s;ons, who in Temper and Di&s;po&s;i|tion re&s;emble little Children, then it is natural to reflect how much you are obliged to come to Chri&s;t, that the amiable Qualities you have, may be fini&s;hed and compleat. You already have many lovely Di&s;po&s;itions, and even a Stranger might &s;ee many Things in you that might en|gage his Heart. Even a Saint mu&s;t re&s;emble you in &s;ome Things, and be as a little Child, as a Preparative for Heaven. But alas! you want one Thing; and that is, inward Holine&s;s. And with|out this, all your amiable Qualities are utterly deficient, and leave you guilty, vile, loath&s;ome Creatures, in the Sight of God. Without this, you are really but gilded Ma&s;&s;es of Corruption and Deformity. But &s;hould you come to Je&s;us, He would put his Comeline&s;s upon yon. He would make you all-glorious within: He would compleat your Character, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ender you all-ex|cellent <HI>throughout.</HI> But alas! if you come not to him, the agreeable Qualities you have, will gra|dually decay, and you will degenerate into down|right unmingled Wickedne&s;s. When you &s;ink into the infernal Regions, you will contract the very Genius and Temper of a Devil; all the Re|mains of Virtue, and whatever of the Image of God you may have retained &s;ince the Fall, will drop from you. Thus "from him that bath not, &s;hall be taken away even that which he hath."</P>
<P>BUT if we con&s;ider this Rea&s;on, <Q>for of &s;uch is the Kingdom of Heaven,</Q> as &s;ignifying, that the Go&s;pel Church upon Earth, and even the hea|venly Church, con&s;i&s;ts of little Children as well as
<PB N="18" REF="041259_0017_101A683C27905F48">Adults, then what a great Inducement may this be to you to labour to be of their happy Number? Why &s;hould not you enter into the Kingdom of Heaven as well as others? There's young Abijah, in whom was found &s;ome good Thing towards the Lord God of I&s;rael, even the wicked Family of Jeroboam. There are Jeremiah and John the Bapti&s;t, who were &s;anctified from the Wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">. There is Timothy, who from a Child knew <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> Holy Scriptures. There are Thou&s;ands of little Creatures, who ju&s;t &s;tayed long enough upon Earth, to know them&s;elves, and their God and Saviour, and have their deprav'd Nature chang'd, and then wing'd their willing Flight to Heaven. It is not to my pre&s;ent Purpo&s;e to enquire into the future State of tho&s;e that die in Infancy before they are capable of Rea&s;on. But as to the many who die in their earlier Days, when Rea&s;on has begun to dawn, they are con&s;idered as moral Agents, and rewarded according to their Works: And we have good Rea&s;on to hope, that &s;undry of them in their &s;hort Space of Life, are effectually prepar'd for a happy Eternity. I have my&s;elf &s;een promi&s;ing Appearances of &s;uch early Piety, in various Places.
