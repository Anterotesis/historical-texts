<HEAD>ORATION, DELIVERED AT <HI>BENNINGTON Augu&s;t</HI> 16th, 1799.</HEAD>
<P>ON an occa&s;ion like the pre&s;ent, and in all a&s;&s;emblage like that before which I now &s;tand, I am con&s;cious that great application to a &s;ubject is nece&s;&s;ary, in order to in&s;truct, and great ingenuity, in order to entertain. With re&s;pect to the fir&s;t, that nece&s;&s;ary proportion of at|tention due from the conductor of an exten&s;ive, and in the pre&s;ent cri&s;is, by no means enviable public bu&s;ine&s;s, from the father of a large and in no wi&s;e opulent family, (lately bere&s;t of its be&s;t &s;upport, a remembrance of who&s;e virtues calls the daily &s;igh, and forces the nightly tear from my widowed recollection) will pro|claim me not to have been capable of paying on the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion. Should
<PB N="4" REF="035599_0004_1005FC2FD0A15EB8">I fail in the &s;econd re&s;pect, the &s;hortne&s;s of my time for preparation, taken into view with my earne&s;t and &s;incere wi&s;h to plea&s;e, will make a large draught in my favor, on your well known and ofte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> ex|perienced candor and genero&s;ity.</P>
<P>Impre&s;&s;ed with the&s;e ideas, I &s;hall pro|ceed, without further apology, to lay the thoughts and re&s;earches of a few lei&s;|ure hours before you, hoping to afford in|&s;truction to &s;ome, to give plea&s;ure to others, and, if po&s;&s;ible, to avoid offence to any.</P>
<P>A worthy young gentleman of this vi|cinity, when lately conducting a periodi|cal publication, in a neighboring &s;late, devoted one quarter of it to beautiful col|lections and original offays, calculated to rai&s;e the geni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s, and to mend the the heart; and adopted as it; motto, that beautiful and poetical &s;entiment, "I have here made a no&s;egay of culled flowers, and bring nothing of my own but the thread that ties them." Unhappily for him, his culled flowers, or their appendages, &s;melt too &s;trongly like the cultivation of 1777 to &s;uit the vicinity he had cho&s;en for his re&s;idence. How it may fare with my
<PB N="5" REF="035599_0005_1005FC315B7A0EC0">pre&s;ent effay, is not a matter of very great anxiety to me, want of lei&s;ure having forced me to make very large, and even literal extracts, from various authors. If therefore, I can produce a fair claim to a hand&s;ome "&s;tring to tie them," the prai&s;e of having judiciou&s;ly &s;elected and arranged important political truths (in the opinion of the pre&s;ent company) my am|bition will be fully gratified.</P>
<P>An ingenious anonymous author, who wrote about the beginning of the pre&s;ent revolutionary war in Europe, remarks, "That the world has for ages been flooded by the blood of its inhabitants, thro' the caprices of tyrants, under the denomina|tion of Kings, Emperors, Popes, &amp;c. and the mi&s;ery of millions demands of wi&s;dom, where is the power which e&s;tabli&s;hes and connects all the orders of a community, and on which they all depend? Where is the centre to which every thing tends, the principle from which all is derived the &s;overeign that can do everything? Who can point out to us the form, the organi|zation of that moral per&s;on, a &s;ociety or community, to which unity is nece&s;&s;ary and of which liberty is the effect?"</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="035599_0006_1005FC32E6B7D998">
The&s;e are indeed momentuous que&s;t|ions: Satisfactory an&s;wers to them is not intere&s;ting to a bare neighborhood, to a &s;tate, or to a kingdom, but is of the mo&s;t intimate concern to the world, and of the highest importance to the great family of man.</P>
<P>The &s;ophi&s;try of political writers has been exhausted <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">n the comparative mer|its of monarchies, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span">, and de|mocracies, but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> in the de|moc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ati<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters"> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> of the United States, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> now &s;preading thro the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> has been exhibited, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span"> of a &s;ociety, which may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> and defend with its while force, the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> and prop|erty of every one of its members, and in which each individual, by uniting him&s;elf to the whole, &s;hall never thele&s;s be obedi|ent only to him&s;elf, and remain fully at liberty to every thing but injury.</P>
<P>If this de&s;irable &s;tate of things can ex|i&s;t under any po&s;&s;ible form of govern|ment, it must certainly be under tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> which is the lea&s;t complicate in its con|struction, and which mo&s;t intimately co|incides with the views, and most critical

<P>It is, perhaps, of as great importance to the exi&s;tence and well being of repub|lican governments, as any one principle whatever, that the public voice &s;hould have a mode of expre&s;&s;ing it&s;elf, and that &s;uch mode &s;hould form the ba&s;is of every political con&s;titution: For the &s;upreme power it&s;elf can never be deputed, the ac|tual &s;overeignty re&s;ides in the body of the people, and he who wi&s;hes to &s;ubvert it, is a traitor to the commonwealth of freedom.</P>
<P>Hence it re&s;ults, that the act which
<PB N="8" REF="035599_0008_1005FC37810E2058">con&s;titutes the American government <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> act which con&s;titutes a free government cannot po&s;&s;ibly be a contract.

<P>The nece&s;&s;ity of government, in civil|ized &s;ociety, has in all ages, and forever will, induce men to &s;orm &s;ocial compacts, and depute certain powers to individuals or public bodies, con&s;tituted as actors in behalf of the &s;overeign people. But when the people have deputed they are not defunct; the &s;overeignty is not annihil|ated; and however con&s;titutions may point out no way for the &s;overeign to make <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> will known, yet, the power ex|i&s;ts, its d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ed<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">, votee is heard at &s;olemn

<P>It may perhaps be argued with pro|priety, from the preceding, that it would be the height of wi&s;dom, were all con&s;ti|tutions so formed, as (without waiting for evils and mal-admini&s;trations to gain &s;trength from the &s;upinene&s;s of the peo|ple) to call its public functionaries &s;tated|ly and regularly to an account for their admini&s;tration, and to determine public|ly, whether they had confined them&s;elves within the bounds pre&s;cribed them. The general will &s;hould flow from all to be agreeable to all, every one &s;ubjects himself thus to the conditions which he impo&s;es on others: this is equitable be|cau&s;e common to all; u&s;eful becau&s;e it can have no object but the general good, and durable becau&s;e re&s;ting on the public <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">trength.

<PB N="10" REF="035599_0010_1005FC39D82CB880">produced; effects would thus become cau&s;es, and even errors in&s;tructions.</P>
<P>If we turn our thoughts on the occa|&s;ions which have produced the over|throw of governments, and the gen|eral de&s;truction of constitutions in the world, we &s;hall trace them univer&s;ally to the linking of the arbitrary power of u&s;urpers, with the &s;acerdotal tyranny of exccle&s;ia&s;ties. The pre&s;ent appears to be an age favourable to the inve&s;tiga|tion of principles, and con&s;titutions are ari&s;ing which mu&s;t apparently exclude the injury, by foreclo&s;ing the admission of the evil. In the demonstrative &s;ciences truths not clearly admited are never en|forced: and truth is never oppo&s;ed with pa&s;&s;ion and malignity, but when enjoined as matter of belief, without &s;uitable de|mon&s;tration. And as it is with axioms o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;cience, &s;o it would be with tho&s;e of reli|gion, were that &s;acred bu&s;ine&s;s left by man as it is left by God: by that God wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> is the &s;ource of being, who&s;e eye pervade<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> immen&s;ity, and of who&s;e exi&s;tence no ra|tional mind can doubt, without feeling it&s;elf involved in inextricable ab&s;urdities.</P>
<P>Happy are the American States, su|premely
<PB N="11" REF="035599_0011_1005FC3B647C4D30">happy their national federation, in rejecting from their con&s;titutions &s;uper|&s;titious e&s;tabli&s;hments of every kind, and leaving to the individual the &s;acred right of wor&s;hiping Jehovah, in &s;uch way as the dictates of his con&s;cience pre&s;cribes, &s;ecure from injury, and re&s;trained alone from injuring his fellow men, his family, or him&s;elf, by his religious duties. This is truly a &s;ource of exultation to every un|bia&s;ed mind, and &s;eems to promi&s;e a &s;ta|bility to our con&s;titutions, that no other principle could have en&s;ured.</P>
<P>Super&s;tition has been involved in the con&s;titutions, and predominated in the governments of the world univer&s;ally; &s;ometimes acting as an in&s;trument, often|er as a director, and forever &s;heltered from the aproach of rea&s;on, by its a&s;&s;um|ed &s;anctity, and the &s;uppo&s;ed expediency of &s;uporting the very con&s;titutions, which it was ever &s;ecretly, and &s;urreptitiou&s;ly undermining.</P>
<P>The Romi&s;h impo&s;ture was perhaps the mo&s;t remarkable in this re&s;pect of any upon record in the annals of modern hi&s;tory. It approached civil government in the garb of lowly meekne&s;s and di&s;in|tere&s;ted

<P>But the world became alarmed, and na|tions revolted again&s;t the &s;acred impo&s;i|tion; yet melancholly to relate, they pre&s;erved a &s;acerdotal egg, in every ne&s;t, which under one &s;hape or other has pro|duced a gho&s;tly mon&s;ter, a little nicer but as &s;atal quite to prey upon the vitals of liberty; until the e&s;tabli&s;hment of e|qual governments in America, under con|&s;titutions which rejected prie&s;t-cra&s;t alto|gether, as a &s;tate engine, gave an exalted le&s;ion to mankind, and leaves religion &s;ubject to the di&s;cernment of every mind, as the great parent of the world, and him who taught as never man before or &s;ince taught men, has le&s;t that intere&s;ting facred bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
