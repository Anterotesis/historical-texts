<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>I CONCEIVE that it is totally unne|ce&s;&s;ary for me to make any comment upon the great advantage it would be to this country to be &s;upplied with all the u&s;eful metals from its own mines; to purcha&s;e which, an immen&s;e &s;um, every one knows, is annually &s;ent to Eu|rope.</P>
<P>Americans are an enlightened people, and ve|ry capable of judging of what is calculated to promote the true intere&s;t of their country.</P>
<P>I therefore &s;ubmit, with much deference, the following plan and propo&s;als to their con&s;idera|tion. It is a plan that I have taken full time to con&s;ider, and am convinced of its practicability.</P>
<P>The greate&s;t difficulty that I &s;ee will attend it is, that mining is a bu&s;ine&s;s that the people in general are afraid of being concerned in.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t, therefore, beg that my reader will lay a&s;ide all that &s;ort of prejudice, while peru&s;ing the following pages; if &s;o, his rea&s;on will, I flatter my&s;elf, be convinced, and he will &s;ee, that mining is not &s;o dangerous a bu&s;ine&s;s as he may have &s;uppo&s;ed it to be.</P>
<P>The plan of forming a company with a large capital to work mines of lead, copper, coals, &amp;c.
<PB N="iv" REF="032245_0003_0FF1A3EA18BECB08">in the United States, is not a new idea with me.</P>
<P>Every per&s;on conver&s;ant with bu&s;ine&s;s is able to e&s;timate the advantage ari&s;ing from an a&s;&s;oci|ation of capital. Undertakings of great public as well-as private utility are, by this mode, ac|compli&s;hed with ea&s;e; and by it many valuable &s;ources of wealth have been di&s;covered. I will beg leave to note a few.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t ve&s;&s;el fitted out in England for a whaling voyage was from the port of Hull, by a number of adventurers joining in the expen&s;e. Their &s;ucce&s;s was great, and, in a few years, a number of &s;hips were fitted out for that trade; and there was &s;carce a huxter, or even a porter, in the town, that was not concerned.</P>
<P>The plan was the &s;ame with regard to the coal-trade. Many ve&s;&s;els have been fitted out from Newca&s;tle and Whitehaven, on &s;hares even &s;o low as &pound;5. Similar a&s;&s;ociations with regard to &s;hipping are very common in this country, particularly in the ea&s;tern &s;tates, where we often find, that even the men before the ma&s;t are in part owners. The advantage ari&s;ing to the com|munity is great; for the&s;e &s;chemes give the in|du&s;trious poor an opportunity of employing their little &s;avings to advantage, which might otherwi&s;e have been &s;pent in riot and drunken|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>I have often, with much &s;atisfaction, contem|plated the good effects ari&s;ing from the various a&s;&s;ociations of capital in Britain; and my rea&s;on has long been convinced that they have been, and &s;till are, the principal &s;ources from whence the amazing wealth of that country flow. I know
<PB REF="032245_0004_0FF1A41AC1EEB870">of no pur&s;uit where an a&s;&s;ociation of capital is &s;o proper as for the purpo&s;e of working mines; for, in general, the &s;um required is great, and the ri&s;k con&s;iderable. Unle&s;s the vein is already di&s;covered, the ri&s;k con&s;i&s;ts in &s;earching for it; but there is no ri&s;k in the mines I am about to recommend, and which I &s;hall prove by the mo&s;t unque&s;tionable te&s;timony to be of immen&s;e value.</P>
<P>I have now been near &s;ix years in America, the greate&s;t part of which time has been &s;pent in making di&s;coveries in the mineral kingdom, and in which I have been very &s;ucce&s;sful. I now offer to the public a plan by which they may benefit from my re&s;earches, looking for|ward only to a moderate compen&s;ation for my time and travelling expen&s;es. It is probable that many grammatical errors will be di&s;covered by my learned reader; but he will, I am &s;ure, wave critici&s;m, when he is informed, that the only colleges that I have had an opportunity of &s;tudying in were, mines, &s;melting works, and manufactories.</P>

<HEAD>PROPOSALS, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THE fir&s;t mines I would recommend, are &s;itu|ated in Lanca&s;ter county, Penn&s;ylvania, five miles from Stra&s;burgh, thirteen from Lanca&s;ter, thir|ty-five from Wilmington, fifty from Philadel|phia, and only two miles from the turnpike road.</P>
<P>They were di&s;covered by a German, of the name of Ter&s;ey, in or before the year 1732; and in that year, the hon. John Penn, made a grant of the land where the mine was found, to the following gentlemen, for the expre&s;s purpo&s;e of having it worked, viz. governor Hamilton, judge Allen, James Logan, James Steel, and Thomas Schute, <ABBR>e&s;q</ABBR> And it al&s;o appears, that Mr. Penn joined in the expen&s;e of opening the mine, &amp;c. in doing which, they di&s;covered one of tho&s;e uncommon vitriolic &s;prings, called by the Germans, <HI>ziment wa&s;&s;er,</HI> i. e. water &s;trongly impregnated with the vitriol of copper, or, as &s;ome writers have called them, copper &s;prings; but, notwith&s;tanding this invaluable di&s;covery, it does not appear that any of the gentlemen were acquainted with the value of the water, as no attempt appears to have ever been made to turn it to account after the European manner, which I &s;hall have occa&s;ion to de&s;cribe. But previous, I will, for the &s;atisfaction of tho&s;e who may wi&s;h to forward my plan, &s;tate the proofs I have ob|tained

The&s;e proofs al&s;o, fortunately, report the quan|tity and value of the water; and, from the great ability as well as re&s;pectability of the men, leave no doubt of the truth of the di&s;covery.

<P>IN the province of Penn&s;ylva|nia is a copper mine, which af|fords a &s;pring, that appears to have the &s;ame ef|fect as that Iri&s;h water lately de&s;cribed by Dr. William Henry, and Dr. Bond, in the 47th, and 48th volumes of the philo&s;ophical tran&s;actions, but is much &s;harper, for it will di&s;&s;olve iron in a quarter part of the time; and we are a&s;&s;ured, by the accounts tran&s;mitted from the proprietors of it, of the trials they have made, that it yields the &s;ame copper, mud, or du&s;t, as our crone|baun water, of the county of Wicklow, in this kingdom, (being the water above mentioned) which, being collected from bars of iron im|mer&s;ed in it, for the purpo&s;e of extracting the copper from the Penn&s;ylvania water, it produced above half pure copper, on being melted in a crucible; an experiment that requires to be re|peated, in order to a&s;certain the proportion of copper contained, with accuracy; our copper &s;pring, of the county of Wicklow, yielding a
<PB N="9" REF="032245_0007_0FF1A420B2071D18">proportion con&s;iderably larger than this, viz. &s;ix|teen parts of copper out of twenty of the mud.</P>
<P>In the neighbourhood is a great abundance of the ores of vitriol and &s;ulphur, and the &s;pring comes through an immen&s;e body of vitriol ore, and the &s;upply of water is very large; 700 or 800 hog&s;heads flowing in 24 hours. The wa|ter is of a pale green colour, of an acid, &s;weet, au&s;tere, inky, and nau&s;eous ta&s;te.</P>
<P>But the genuine quality, as well as large pro|portion of the impregnating &s;alt, will further appear by the following analy&s;is of this water, viz. a pint of it exhaled by a &s;low fire, left 400 grains of &s;olid contents, which were partly green, and partly ochre coloured, with an intermixture of blui&s;h, and of a rough &s;weeti&s;h ta&s;te, like that of &s;al martis, and appeared to be chiefly &s;aline, not leaving above four grains of indi&s;&s;o|luble matter, on di&s;&s;olving 196 grains of it and filtring.</P>
<P>Thus it appears, that the proportion of vitrio|lic parts in this water is very large, viz. above &s;ix drachms to a pint, or 3200 grains to a gal|lon; and, con&s;equently, it is a &s;tronger &s;olution of vitriol than &s;ea water is of marine &s;alt; and moreover is, truly, con&s;iderably the &s;tronge&s;t of all the vitriolic waters that have yet occurred to my ob&s;ervation; for, our Cronebaun water, in the county of Wicklow, gives but 256 grains from a gallon; Haigh, in Lanca&s;hire, (the &s;tronge&s;t in Britain, that I know of) 1920 grains; Shad|well, 1320; Kilbrew, in the county of Mealth, 1530, from the &s;ame quantity; &s;o that, be&s;ides the copper to be obtained by immer&s;ing bars of
<PB N="10" REF="032245_0008_0FF1A3F2FA623290">iron, as in our county of Wicklow water, this water offers to its proprietors another peculiar advantage, viz. an opportunity of erecting a copperas work, or manufacture, of vitriol; e&s;|pecially, the va&s;t &s;upply of water, and plenty of fuel in the place, con&s;idered.</P>

<P>I DO CERTIFY, that Dr. Benj. Franklin, a few weeks before his death, informed me, that, at the time the Gap copper-mine, in Lanca&s;ter county, belonging to James Logan, and others, was worked, a &s;pring of water was di&s;covered in the &s;ame, highly impregnated with copper.

<P>THIS IS TO CERTIFY, to whom it may concern, that we the &s;ub&s;cribers were frequently at the copper mines in Lanca&s;ter county, known by the name of the Gap mine, during the time the &s;aid mine was working by James Logan and Co.; and, from hearing the people often talking of the water turning iron into copper, we have very often, when at the mines, put the blade of our knives into the water as it came from the pumps, which, in a few minutes, would be covered with copper. A negro, called black Ned, took advantage of this circum&s;tance and fixed a large trough in &s;uch manner that part of the water from the pumps u&s;ed to run through the &s;ame. In this trough he put pieces of old iron, which the water (as then under&s;tood) turn|ed into copper, of which he u&s;ed to make buc|kles, handles for knives, and other &s;mall articles. This negro was a &s;mith by trade, and was &s;aid to be a very ingenious man.</P>
<P>And we further certify, that we have often &s;een quantities of the ore got in this mine, and frequently heard the miners &s;ay, that it was a very rich mine, if the water could be kept down &s;o as they could work con&s;tantly. At this time, there were eight pumps working in the pit, which turned out &s;o much water that it over|flowed a meadow, and de&s;troyed the gra&s;s &s;o ef|fectually that mo&s;t of the places the water u&s;ed to cover, are barren at this time.

<SALUTE>MR. HENFREY. <HI>SIR,</HI></SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE to lament that the Gap mine cannot be worked upon terms worthy of its con&s;equence, in my opinion, unle&s;s advances larger than my pre&s;ent engagements permit, can be brought for|ward. I vi&s;ited the work, you know, when one of the &s;hafts was nearly exhau&s;ted; and, from the effect of the little water of the ziment kind then examined, it produced a precipitation which was promi&s;ing indeed. From the effect of this kind of water fir&s;t in Germany, then in Arklow, and la&s;tly from the artificial ziment water in the Paris mine, I am convinced, nothing could be more profitable. Could the work proceed upon proper principles, with a capital equal to erec|ting an engine to free the works of water, and &s;aving of the martial vitriol, and &s;ulphur, I be|lieve no e&s;tate could equal it. How different, from pur&s;uing a vein through a <HI>&s;tony country,</HI> of incertain yield, is the proce&s;s of precipitation, which proceeds with little labour, whil&s;t we are at re&s;t. That the ore after roa&s;ting and catch|ing the &s;ulphureous quality to a profit, would be
<PB N="13" REF="032245_0011_0FF1A426B75F5AA0">an object to the company, I have no doubt; but I cannot, without aid, pur&s;ue the nece&s;&s;ary plan, and mu&s;t therefore accede to a &s;ale of &s;hares, if partners well di&s;po&s;ed to a fair experiment of public utility and fair and rea&s;onable profits can be procured. I therefore, Sir, agree to the &s;ale of &s;hares, &s;o as to bring to the te&s;t the value of that work, but without relinqui&s;hing all my right, and you will con&s;ider this as the evidence of my a&s;&s;ent. What number of &s;hares I &s;hall retain, will depend upon other circum&s;tances, but I believe, from my known opinion of the pro&s;pect, you will &s;uppo&s;e the number will be as great as I can compa&s;s.</P>

<P><HI>As many of my readers will, I pre&s;ume, be unac|quainted with the value of copper &s;prings, that have been di&s;covered in Europe, I have conclud|ed that the following extracts may give them much &s;atisfaction, being from &s;uch unque&s;tionable and re&s;pectable authority.</HI></P>
<P>'IN the year 1673, Doctor Brown vi&s;ited a famous copper mine at Hern Grundt, about &s;e|ven Engli&s;h miles from <HI>New Sol,</HI> in upper Hun|gary, and he informs us, that there he &s;aw two &s;prings, called the old and new ziment, which turned iron into copper, as it is vulgarly &s;aid.</P>
<P>'But the ca&s;e is, that the iron is di&s;&s;olved by the vitriolic acid of this &s;pring-water, and the copper is precipitated in its metallic form in the place of the iron.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="032245_0012_0FF1A3F7B86E80B0">
'It has been the cu&s;tom in Germany for &s;ome centuries, to collect the copper contained in the&s;e waters, by filling with them &s;ome pits made purpo&s;ely for this operation. Old iron is thrown in; and, being di&s;&s;olved by the acid, is &s;u&s;pen|ded in the water while the copper is precipita|ted; the mud being raked out, is melted after|wards in a furnace, and very fine copper is pro|duced. From 100 tons of iron, 84 and &s;ome|times 90 tons of fine copper is thus produced.</P>
<P>'But although this method of obtaining cop|per has been long practi&s;ed in Germany, yet it is but of late years, &s;ays bi&s;hop Wat&s;on, (<HI>p.</HI> 238 of the fir&s;t volume of his e&s;&s;ays) that any &s;uc|ce&s;sful attempts of this kind have been made either in England or Ireland; in the la&s;t, at lea&s;t, it was quite owing to an accident. There are the very celebrated copper mines at Arklow, in the county of Wicklow, in Ireland, and from the&s;e mines i&s;&s;ue a great quantity of water &s;trong|ly impregnated with vitriol of copper. One of the workmen having accidentally left an iron &s;hovel in the <HI>water</HI> he found it, &s;ome weeks af|ter, &s;o incru&s;ted with a coat of copper, that it was thought to be changed into copper.</P>
<P>'The proprietors of the mines, in pur&s;uance of this hint, made proper pits and receptacles for the water; and have obtained, by means of &s;oft iron bars put in them, &s;uch quantities of cop|per, that the&s;e &s;treams are now of as much con|&s;equence as the mines them&s;elves.</P>
<P>'One ton of iron produces near two tons of copper mud, and each ton of mud produces, when melted, 1600 wt. fine copper, which &s;ells
<PB N="15" REF="032245_0013_0FF1A428579965A8">for &pound; 10 &s;terling per ton more than the copper which is fluxed from the ore.</P>
<P>'There is, in the I&s;le of Angle&s;ey, on the coa&s;t of North-Wales, a mountain called Paris, which abounds in copper ore, the bed of ore being above 40 feet in thickne&s;s. The le&s;ees of this mine, annually rai&s;e from &s;ix to 700 tons of merchant|able ore, and daily employ above 40 furnaces in &s;melting it. This ore contains a great quantity of &s;ulphur, which mu&s;t be &s;eparated by roa&s;ting before it can be fluxed into copper.</P>
<P>'The phlogi&s;ton, with part of the vitriolic acid, is diper&s;ed into the air by the force of the fire. Another part of the acid attacks and di&s;&s;olves &s;uch a quantity of the copper, that the water in which the roa&s;ted ore is wa&s;hed (by means of old iron immer&s;ed in it according to the German method) produces great quantities of fine cop|per, &s;o that the proprietors have there obtained, in one year, near 100 tons of copper precipitated from this water.</P>
<P>'If this water was afterwards evaporated, it would yield green vitriol, at the rate of nearly 200 tons of vitriol, for each hundred tons of iron.'</P>
<P>I have vi&s;ited both the above mines, and know that the bi&s;hop's &s;tatements are taken from facts, and upon which I founded my calculations, <HI>See the Table.</HI> When I was at the Arklow mines in Ireland, one of the proprietors informed me, that they had then four hundred tons of iron in the different pits and re&s;ervoirs, precipitating the copper fom the water, and that they &s;hould en|crea&s;e the quantity. He al&s;o &s;aid, that they were
<PB N="16" REF="032245_0014_0FF1A3FD9DF88410">buying plates of ca&s;t iron, which, if found to an&s;wer, would make a very great &s;aving; and, &s;ince I came to America, I have received infor|mation, that the ca&s;t iron did an&s;wer, and that they u&s;e no other, either at <HI>Crone Baun,</HI> or in the i&s;le of Angle&s;ey.</P>
<P>Since the di&s;covery of the&s;e natural vitriolic waters, the proprietors of copper mines have ta|ken the hint of trying the ores after roa&s;ting, and find that, where they are highly &s;ulphureous, the waters u&s;ed to wa&s;h them (which is done before &s;melting) always become &s;ufficiently im|pregnated with copper, to pay them well for their trouble and expence of precipitating it by means of iron.</P>
<P>In my e&s;timate, I have put only a &s;mall value upon the ORE at the Gap mines, notwith&s;tand|ing the quantity is immen&s;e, and &s;imilar to the <HI>ore</HI> worked in the i&s;le of Angle&s;ey. I have &s;unk upon the body in &s;everal places, and always found the ore within a few feet of the &s;urface, but it cannot be got in quantity until there is a ma|chine erected to pump off the water. The <HI>ore</HI> may then be rai&s;ed with as much ea&s;e as the quarrying of &s;tone.</P>
<P>I have treated this ore in the &s;ame manner they do the ore at the Angle&s;ey mines, and have al|ways obtained a proportionate yield of copper from it; and I now &s;ay, that it is my candid opinion, that this body or bed of ore, may be worked to great and certain profit. But I find that it is a generally received opinion in this country, that wages are yet too high to carry on any large works to advantage. That this re|mark
<PB N="17" REF="032245_0015_0FF1A42B6BE5EA40">may be well founded, with regard to ma|nufactures, I admit, but that it applies with equal force to mining I deny.</P>
<P>There is no manufactory in England but what is carried on by con&s;tant oppo&s;ition of one ma|nufacturer again&s;t another, and their fir&s;t care is to reduce the poor workmen as low as they po&s;|&s;ibly can. But the mining bu&s;ine&s;s is carried on in a very different manner; the work is almo&s;t all done by <HI>bargains.</HI> When a vien of ore is di&s;covered, a miner or gang of miners are offer|ed the work, and the captain (i. e. the manager) and they &s;ettle the price per ton that &s;hall be paid by the proprietors for rai&s;ing the ore. The&s;e con|tracts are generally made for from one to three months, and they are, in fact, a continued lottery between the miners and proprietors of the mines. If the vein prove poor, then the miners make only low wages; if rich, they will make from one to five pounds &s;terling per day, and that for weeks together. This is a proof, that a mine can pay great wages, and yet give great fortunes to the owners; for the managers never let a bar|gain to the miners but with a certainty of gain to the proprietors.</P>
<P>The great ri&s;k in mining is in &s;earching for the vein of ore and opening the works. A &s;tri|king proof of this was exhibited at <HI>Schuyler</HI>'s mines, near Newark, in New-Jer&s;ey. Some years after tho&s;e mines were known to be very productive, a company in Bri&s;tol (in England) to whom &s;ome of the ore had been &s;ent, obtain|ed a lea&s;e from the owners of the land on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the hill, where Schuyler was
<PB N="18" REF="032245_0016_0FF1A3FF2962A290">rai&s;ing ore in great quantities. They &s;ent over a number of experienced miners and other work|men who continued to &s;earch for the vein, until they had &s;pent their employers &pound; 30,000, who then gave up the pur&s;uit. All this time, Mr. Schuyler was making a large fortune, which &s;hews that high wages are not &s;o inimical to the working of mines in any country, if you have a good vein of ore to work upon. But I will admit that, where wages are low, you may work a poor mine to advantage, which, in a country where they are high, you might lo&s;e money by.</P>
<P>The fact ju&s;t &s;tated &s;hews wherein the danger of working mines con&s;i&s;ts, and I am ready to admit it is very great. But, at the Gap mines, there is no ri&s;k. The ore, we know, is there in great abundance, and the vitriolic &s;pring, which is of an incalculable value, I have proved, by re|peated trials, to be in tho&s;e mines, and the works are now in &s;uch a &s;tate as to require only the aid of a machine of &s;ufficient power to rai&s;e the water &s;o as to keep the pits clean. A &s;team en|gine, of moderate powers, will be capable of do|ing this.</P>
<P>But there are many objections to erecting a &s;team engine in this country. 1 &s;t. The great ex|pence of erecting one; 2d, the con&s;umption of fuel; 3d, the frequent repairs; and 4th, the high wages you mu&s;t give to an engineer to at|tend the machine. I would, therefore, recom|mend that a level &s;hould be brought up through a meadow to the mines, by which a fall of from 25 to 30 feet may be gained, and a water-wheel of 25 feet diameter will be &s;ufficient to works as
<PB N="19" REF="032245_0017_0FF1A42FC2E74558">many pumps as will clear the mines of the com|mon, and rai&s;e the copper water for u&s;e. There are three &s;mall &s;treams in the mine lands, that may be conducted into on re&s;ervoir, which would then, I am certain, give as much water as the machine will require to keep it con&s;tantly going.</P>
<P>The machinery, on this plan, will be &s;imple, and &s;uch as may be made at the mines. Nor will it be &s;o liable to get out of order as the works of a &s;team engine. Another advantage will be, the &s;aving of fuel, which may be e&s;ti|mated at between two and three cords per day; and further, if this plan is put in practice, the mines may be much &s;ooner made productive; for when the level is brought up, the bed of poor ore, before noted, will be laid dry, and may be worked to immediate profit much &s;ooner than if we have to wait for the erecting of a &s;team engine, and at much le&s;s expen&s;e to the compa|ny. It may be proper to note another circum|&s;tance in favour of the level, which is, that I have well-founded rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e, that, as much ore may be rai&s;ed in driving it as will pay a con|&s;iderable part, if not all the expence; and, when the works are completed, the repairs would be but trifling compared with tho&s;e of a &s;team en|gine, which would be a con&s;tant and heavy draw|back upon the company's profits. My candid opinion, therefore, is, after the mo&s;t mature con|&s;ideration, in favour of the level, and a machine to be worked by water.</P>
<P>I will now, for the information of tho&s;e per|&s;ons who may be di&s;po&s;ed to join in forwarding the propo&s;ed plan, note the</P>

<HEAD>PRESENT STATE OF THE WORKS AT THE GAP MINES.</HEAD>
<P>We have built a &s;aw-mill, made two dams, and cut a head, tail, race, &amp;c.</P>
<P>There is a large log-hou&s;e for the copperas works, a large lead boiler, &s;everal ley tubs, ci&s;terns, &amp;c.</P>
<P>There are a carpenter's and &s;mith's &s;hops, and two log-hou&s;es for workmen.</P>
<P>There is a variety of tools, with pit-ropes, wind|la&s;&s;es, buckets, &amp;c.; al&s;o, a complete &s;et of boring rods, one hundred feet long.</P>
<P>The two main &s;hafts have been cleaned out, which was attended with great trouble and difficulty, as we were obliged to work night and day on account of the water.</P>
<P>There is a machine to work the pumps which will be of great u&s;e in getting the water out until a more powerful one can be completed; and there are eight tier of pumps, two tier deep, all in good wor|king order. About fifty tons of are have been rai&s;|ed, and a great deal of other work done, but which I do not conceive it nece&s;&s;ary for me to de&s;cribe.</P>
<P>I &s;hall, therefore, only further note, that a &s;mall part of the level is drove, and that two men are now at work upon it.</P>

<P>The&s;e various works have co&s;t our company a con&s;iderable &s;um, as will appear by our books, and the company who fir&s;t opened the mines mu&s;t, I am certain, have expended at lea&s;t thir|ty thou&s;and dollars; &s;o that the propo&s;ed com|pany will come in on very advantageous terms, as, by tho&s;e expences, the mines have been put
<PB N="21" REF="032245_0019_0FF1A4314E23B488">in &s;uch a &s;tate that they only now require a &s;team or other engine to make them pay the pro|fit I have &s;tated, and with probability much greater.</P>
<P>I will now de&s;cribe the works below:</P>
<P>One of the pits is &s;even feet &s;quare, the other is &s;even by five. The wide &s;haft is only about &s;ixty feet deep; the other is much deeper, the vitriolic water ri&s;es fifteen feet from the bottom of the wide &s;haft, and there is forty feet of com|mon water over it; this I have proved many times by my boring rods.</P>
<P>When we had cleared the pits of earth and &s;tones, and had the waters out, I went down. I found the main &s;haft in mo&s;t excellent order; the frame, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;quared logs, laid clo&s;e upon each other, as in building a hou&s;e; in &s;hort, I never &s;aw &s;uch &s;trong work, and &s;o well &s;ecu|red, in any mine I ever was in before.</P>
<P>I found that three drifts had been drove from the main &s;haft. One of them I &s;uppo&s;e to be more than two hundred yards, as it communi|cates with &s;ome &s;hafts that were &s;unk upon a &s;mall hill. Another extends only about twenty yards, at the end of which a &s;ump had been &s;unken, and I found a pump that had been worked by hand in this &s;ump. An old man, who worked at the&s;e mines when fir&s;t open|ed, told me, that he had often heard the miners &s;ay, that there was a very rich vien of ore in the place where the hand pump was fixed, but he &s;aid, that all the contrivances they could think of were not &s;ufficient to keep the water down.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="032245_0020_0FF1A40270EAEB30">
Several of the old Dutchmen who remember the fir&s;t opening of and are &s;till living near the Gap mines, have told me, that they knew for certain, that the miners frequently met with lumps of gold; and one family has been poin|ted out to me, who are now wealthy, and who, my informer &s;aid, he knew had bought <HI>ore</HI> from the miners &s;everal times; and that this man went back to Germany, and that it was well known, that he took &s;ome &s;mall barrels of the <HI>ore</HI> from the Gap mines with him.</P>
<P>My informer al&s;o &s;aid, that the man returned, and that he &s;oon after bought a plantation. He al&s;o &s;aid, that he knew all his friends in Germa|ny, that they were all poor, and that he was certain he could not have gotten his money any other way; that a brother of his father's (then in Germany) wrote to him to &s;end him &s;ome <HI>ore</HI> from the &s;ame mine that the per&s;on alluded to got his from, and that it was very rich in gold.</P>
<P>I do not bring forward this common report with a view to recommend the mines; nor do I place any dependance on the various &s;tories that have been told me, of gold having been got in them&mdash;yet it is a common and well-known fact, that &s;ome copper <HI>ores</HI> are often rich in both gold and &s;ilver. The rea&s;on with me for men|tioning it is, as proof that an ore of &s;ome value has been found in tho&s;e mines; and, &s;hould it only prove to be rich in copper, I &s;hall not wi&s;h for any thing more valuable. That there was a great deal of ore rai&s;ed, I have not the &s;malle&s;t doubt; nor that there is an immen&s;e quantity in the mines. But, be this as it may, my depen|dance
<PB N="23" REF="032245_0021_0FF1A432E0B805B8">is, and always was, upon the &s;trength of the vitriolic water. When a &s;pring of this kind is once fortunately di&s;covered, they have never been known to fail, and the profits ari&s;ing from them are ju&s;t as certain as that two and two make four.</P>
<P>It is now one hundred and twenty-four years &s;ince Dr. Brown's report was made on the <HI>cop|per</HI> &s;pring in Hungary, and forty-one &s;ince Dr. Rutty's account of tho&s;e in Ireland, and both tho&s;e &s;prings &s;till continue to run, and give great profits to their owners. The &s;pring at Crone Baun, in Ireland, was purcha&s;ed about eight years ago by the Liverpool company, and it was &s;aid they gave &pound;. 20,000 &s;terling for them, and that, at the end of the &s;econd year, they had cleared upwards of &pound;. 40,000 &s;terling by them.</P>
<P>I now &s;ubmit to every candid and intelligent per&s;on, if there is not, in many of the common pur&s;uits of man to gain property, as much ri&s;k as there will be in working a mine under &s;uch circum&s;tances as I have de&s;cribed. That min|ing, in general, may be compared to a lottery I am ready to admit; but, that it may be reduced to as great a certainty as mo&s;t other trades and occupations, I mu&s;t al&s;o in&s;i&s;t upon; and, when a fortunate di&s;covery is made, the adventurers acquire wealth much &s;ooner than by any other bu&s;ine&s;s that I am acquainted with. I will al&s;o admit, that many men have been ruined by mining; but this has been owing to their own folly, by ri&s;king too much, which they have been allured to by the pro&s;pect of great gains. But let me a&s;k, is not this al&s;o the ca&s;e in the mer|chantile
<PB N="24" REF="032245_0022_0FF1A4087ABDCFB0">world? Great &s;trokes, as they are called, are &s;ometimes made by great ri&s;ks, but the pru|dent, well-informed merchant, will never ap|prove them. It is the &s;ame in mining. A &s;tri|king in&s;tance, among many that I could recite, was the ca&s;e of lord Hopeton, of Scotland. He had &s;pent the greate&s;t part of his fortune in &s;earching for a vein of lead ore on his e&s;tate, which &s;ome miners had reported to him they were certain they could find. But the cha&s;e con|tinued &s;o long, that his lord&s;hip's pur&s;e began to complain, and he determined to give up the pur|&s;uit; but the miners, being confident of &s;ucce&s;s, agreed to give their employer a month's work; the con&s;equence was, that, in the middle of the la&s;t week of the month, they came upon the vein, which was a very rich one. Lord Hope|ton died only a few years ago, and was &s;aid to be one of the riche&s;t men in Scotland, which he made intirely by tho&s;e lead mines, and they &s;till continue to be productive.</P>
<P>It may, probably, be an objection with &s;ome to my plan, that the Gap mines have never been productive; but this, without pre&s;uming too much, may I believe, be accounted for. The original company con&s;i&s;ted entirely of men of great property, but not one of them appears to have had any knowledge of the mining bu&s;i|ne&s;s; of cour&s;e, every thing was left to mana|gers, who had no intere&s;t further than their &s;a|lary. Under &s;uch circum&s;tances, great underta|kings have generally failed.</P>
<P>But the failure of tho&s;e gentlemen, becomes an advantage to tho&s;e who follow. They ex|pended
<PB N="25" REF="032245_0023_0FF1A437870F0D78">a large &s;um, and proved the mines to be valuable; but, under &s;uch management, had the produce been ever &s;o great, they would, proba|bly, have got but little of it, and that a mine may be given up, and yet be very rich in <HI>ore,</HI> the famous Paris mine, in the i&s;le of Angle&s;ey, is a proof. Several un&s;ucce&s;sful attempts had been made upon this mine, before the Liverpool com|pany undertook it; their property is large, and mo&s;t of them are well &s;killed, both in the art of mining and &s;melting. A number of men were &s;et to work, and they &s;oon di&s;covered a large body of poor copper <HI>ore;</HI> and, it appears, that they have rai&s;ed from 6 to 7000 tons of ore every year, &s;ince the di&s;covery, and have obtained near 100 tons of fine copper, every year, from the wa|ter, as I have before noted. In order to &s;hew that the above mine had been worked before the Li|verpool company got a lea&s;e from the proprietor, (lord Uxbridge) I will mention a curious cir|cum&s;tance that happened re&s;pecting this mine. A Mr. Griffith, a poor Wel&s;h curate, in look|ing over &s;ome old papers which had come into his hands by the death of his wife's grand-father, found an old lea&s;e, that had been granted by the pre&s;ent lord Uxbridge's father to &s;aid Griffith's wife's grand-father, the term of which was not expired. This happened when the mines were giving up trea&s;ure in the mo&s;t extraordinary manner. Mr. Griffith, on this di&s;covery, takes the lea&s;e to a Mr. Williams, an attorney, who informs him, that he thinks his right good, as his wife was the heir of her grand-father. Mr. Griffith makes this bu&s;ine&s;s known to the com|pany
<PB N="26" REF="032245_0024_0FF1A40CD96A7070">then working the mines; but they were not di&s;po&s;ed to admit his claim. He applies to to his friend, the attorney, again, and entered in|to an agreement with him that he &s;hould have half of all he gets if he &s;ucceeds, but the curate to be &s;ubject to no co&s;t. The bu&s;ine&s;s remains in law for a con&s;iderable time; but the company are compelled, at la&s;t, to admit the poor curate's claim; by which, both he and the attorney have become men of large fortunes, and of &s;ome note. Williams was elected a member of parliament &s;even or eight years ago; and the curate, I have been told, thinks him&s;elf as good a man as any bifhop in England.</P>
<P>Let us now con&s;ider the nece&s;&s;ity there is for the people of America to turn their thoughts to the &s;ubject of mining. Copper &s;ells now for three &s;hillings per pound, and the avarage for &s;ix years pa&s;t may be rated at two &s;hillings and nine pence. This high price will be attributed to the wars in Europe, and I admit that they may have operated &s;o as to occa&s;ion an advance. But, was there no other rea&s;on, the ri&s;e would only have been in proportion to the ri&s;e of in&s;u|rence. In that ca&s;e, the advance would only have been about four per cent.; in&s;tead of which we find that the ri&s;e avarages about twenty per cent.; a &s;triking proof that there mu&s;t be other cau&s;es, and, &s;o far as relates to the mining intere&s;t in England, (in particular) they are of a more &s;eri|ous nature than the pre&s;ent war; for the fact is, that the copper mines in that country have been declining in produce for the la&s;t ten years, and, &s;ince the <HI>u&s;e</HI> of &s;heathing and copper bolts for
<PB N="27" REF="032245_0025_0FF1A43BF0BB76C0">&s;hips have come into practice, the demand for copper has been gradually increa&s;ing. The Ec|ton mine, in Stafford&s;hire, belonging to the duke of Devon&s;hire, which, for upwards of twenty years, yielded a profit of from twenty to even &pound;. 30,000 &s;terling per annum, is entirely work|ed out. The mines in Cornwall have become much le&s;s productive; and the famous Paris mine, in the i&s;le of Angle&s;ey, which has given &s;uch immen&s;e fortunes to its owners, is apparently working out very fa&s;t. Mr. Williams, who is now the principal man in the&s;e mines, has made &s;e|veral tours through different parts of Scotland within the la&s;t &s;ix years, entirely for the purpo&s;e of di&s;covering mines; and, it was well known, that the failure of the Paris mine was the rea&s;on.</P>
<P>But, whether it is owing to a failure of the mines, or the encrea&s;ed demand for copper, the effect here will be the &s;ame; and, the rapid en|crea&s;e of population in the United States, mu&s;t add greatly to the demand. Let us, for a mo|ment, look back to the &s;ituation of this country, during the revolution, both with regard to lead and copper. The latter was frequently &s;old for ten &s;hillings per pound, hard money, and the quan|tity to be got, even at that price, was far &s;hort of this demand. But I &s;hould be &s;orry to be un|der&s;tood as looking forward to deriving any ad|vantage to my plan from the calamities of war. No, my hopes and prayers are, that this happy country may never experience it again; but, as the wi&s;dom of men have not yet di&s;covered any mode of &s;ettling national differences, without fir&s;t having recour&s;e to arms, it certainly is &s;ound po|licy
<PB N="28" REF="032245_0026_0FF1A40E661A9BB0">in every nation to render it&s;elf as indepen|dent as po&s;&s;ible of any other. Now, as this is admitted to be <HI>&s;ound policy</HI> among the European nations, how much &s;tronger does it apply to re|mote countries, and, in particular, to the United States; where population has encrea&s;ed and is encrea&s;ing in &s;o rapid a degree!</P>
<P>The origin of commerce mu&s;t have been from &s;ome nation having a &s;urplus of &s;undry articles, and offering tho&s;e articles in exchange to ano|ther nation for &s;omething they had to &s;pare; and, probably, for &s;omething the other country did not produce. This mu&s;t have been the ca&s;e, for the trade by barter mu&s;t, of nece&s;&s;ity, have taken place as &s;oon as there was a hundred hu|man beings in the world, but it was a long time before metal was thought of being u&s;ed as a me|dium for commerce. Trade is &s;till regulated by the &s;ame policy, from which it originated. Ports are opened and &s;hut as the nece&s;&s;ity occurs. This, in general, only relates to grain; but it is only a few years ago that there was an embargo laid upon copper in Britain, and this may be fre|quently the ca&s;e, as copper is now cla&s;&s;ed among the articles of naval &s;tores, and as the con|&s;umption is &s;o much encrea&s;ed, in that coun|try. The ri&s;e of copper in England has alarmed the manufacturers, and &s;everal companies have been formed among that u&s;eful cla&s;s of people, for the purpo&s;e of working mines and &s;melting the ores. In Birmingham, the company, when fir&s;t formed, con&s;i&s;ted of one hundred &s;hares of &pound;. 500 &s;terling each; and no man was allowed to have more than one &s;hare. The rea&s;on is obvious:
<PB N="29" REF="032245_0027_0FF1A43EF14CF4D8">it was a new bu&s;ine&s;s with them; they therefore adopted that prudent plan in order to prevent any man from being ruined by ri&s;king too much, which &s;ome men are apt to do, and particularly in <HI>mining.</HI> This undertaking &s;hews the good &s;en&s;e of tho&s;e who carried it into effect. The price of copper, about twenty years ago, was as low as &s;even-pence per pound &s;terling, and con|tinued &s;o for &s;everal years. It has &s;ince varied much in price, but I do not remember that it was ever down &s;o low as the price noted, and it is now at &s;ixteen-pence per pound. I have recei|ved information that this company have been very &s;ucce&s;sful, and that a company, on a &s;imilar plan, has been &s;ince formed in the town of Sheffield. Need I remark, that, if it was thought nece&s;&s;ary by the manufacturers in Britain to pay attention to mining, that there certainly mu&s;t be a much greater nece&s;&s;ity for the manufacturers in Ame|rica to do it? I will even extend the idea further, I will &s;ay, that it is the intere&s;t of every indivi|dual (the importer excepted) in the United States, to join in any well formed plan for work|ing the mines of this country; and that the United States abounds with copper, lead, and iron, is notorious to every one; and I have found, by a&s;&s;ay, many of the ores both of lead and cop|per are rich in &s;ilver, and &s;ome of the copper ores hold gold. I have di&s;covered lead ores in &s;everal parts of this &s;tate that are much richer than any I ever a&s;&s;ayed in England. Sixty ounces of fine &s;ilver from a ton of lead is con&s;idered very rich there, but the ore I allude to, gives two hundred and forty ounces, which I have
<PB N="30" REF="032245_0028_0FF1A4118B77D638">proved by repeated trials. Lead, in England, is refined when only containing twenty ounces; but, in that ca&s;e, the litharge mu&s;t be &s;old; as there is, by this proce&s;s, an encrea&s;e of weight equal to ten per cent. But, if the litharge is to be reduced to lead again, a lo&s;s of near fifteen per cent. takes place; of cour&s;e it requires the lead to be richer in &s;ilver when the refiner has not a demand for all his litharge.</P>
<P>Zinc ores are found in great quantities in &s;e|veral &s;tates. Some cobalt has al&s;o been di&s;covered, of good quality; but I never have been &s;o for|tunate as to meet with any tin ore. However, I have no doubt but it will be di&s;covered when mines are more generally &s;ought for. Na|ture has not been &s;paring of her bounties, in this re&s;pect, to the United States. The Supreme Being has wi&s;ely ordered it &s;o, that, although he has created every thing for the u&s;e of man, yet he cannot enjoy it without indu&s;try, and, in many ca&s;es, not without great exertions, both of mind and body, and in none more &s;o than what relates to the working of mines. From the&s;e ob&s;ervations may we not conclude, that there is not in &s;ociety a more u&s;eful member than the miner; &s;ince all that his indu&s;try produces is adding to the public &s;tock? It mu&s;t al&s;o be re|membered, that the plough cannot go until the miner has fir&s;t produced the metal.</P>
<P>I have now only to beg leave to recommend my e&s;timate and plan to the &s;erious con&s;idera|tion of my readers, and to a&s;&s;ure them, that the views contemplated by this &s;cheme are fair and honourable.</P>

<P>Note, that, in the above e&s;timate, I have made no charge for erecting the furnaces, mills, and battery works, that will be required to &s;melt and refine the copper, and work it up into bars, bolts, &s;heets, and bottoms for &s;tills; and, on that account, I have rated it at only 1 <ABBR><HI>&s;</HI></ABBR>3 per pound, &s;o that the copper-mud, and ore may, the fir&s;t year, if the company choo&s;e, be &s;ent to England, as the copper would, at the price it now &s;ells for there, be worth from 1 <ABBR><HI>&s;</HI></ABBR>6 to 1 <ABBR><HI>&s;</HI></ABBR>8 per pound, this currency. But, as this would be attended with con&s;iderable lo&s;s, I &s;hall re|commend that the copper-mud and ore be prepared ready for &s;melting, and carefully &s;tored, and, when the directors find, by the monthly returns, that there is a con&s;iderable quantity prepared, I &s;hould advi&s;e that a committee be appointed to go to the mines and take &s;amples from the ore and copper-mud, which &s;hould be divided into two equal parts and &s;ealed up; one part to be delivered to the ma|nager of the mines, and the directors to take the other, which &s;hould be &s;ent to the mint to be a&s;&s;ay|ed. By this mode, the directors will know the true value of the ore and mud, and whether the mana|ger's report is ju&s;t.

<HEAD>The following plan, for conducting the copper mine-works, is &s;ubmitted, to the con&s;ideration of tho&s;e gentlemen who wi&s;h to promote that under|taking.</HEAD>
<P N="1">I. The capital to be &mdash; 50,000 <HI>dolls.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. To be divided into &s;hares of one hundred dollars each, paid by in&s;talments, and lodged in a bank.</P>
<P N="3">III. Seven, or more, directors, and one &s;ecre|tary, to be cho&s;en annually by the company.</P>
<P N="4">IV. The directors to frame a code of laws by which the company are to be governed.</P>
<P N="5">V. The directors to appoint the manager of the mine-works, and clerks, annually.</P>
<P N="6">VI. The manager to tran&s;mit a monthly re|turn to the directors, on the annexed plan.</P>
<P N="7">VII. The directors to meet once a month, to tran&s;act the bu&s;ine&s;s of the company.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. The directors and &s;ecretary to be allow|ed a compen&s;ation for their trouble.</P>
<P N="9">IX. Workmen, and bills again&s;t the mines, to be paid off the la&s;t week in each month.</P>
<P N="10">X. The directors to make a dividend of the profits every &s;ix months.</P>
<P N="11">XI. A &s;tore to be kept at the mines, to &s;upply the workmen. I do not recommend this as an object of profit, but to prevent the men from lo&s;ing their time, as there are no &s;tores nearer than five miles.</P>

<P>If the above plan is carefully attended to, the directors will always know what is doing at the mines, and al&s;o, what profit they are making for the company.</P>
<P><PB REF="032245_0032_0FF1A447E840D710">
The propo&s;er of the preceding plan, will at|tend at No. 126, South Second-&s;treet, to receive the names of &s;uch gentlemen as wi&s;h to forward this work, but no money will be required to be advanced, until the company is organi&s;ed and directors appointed. He will then lay before them his terms and title to the Gap mines, al&s;o an e&s;timate, in which, he will &s;hew that the com|pany may obtain proofs of the practicability of his &s;cheme, and of the value of tho&s;e mines, by an advance of only <HI>ten dollars</HI> on each &s;hare.</P>
