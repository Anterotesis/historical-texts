<P><HI>JOHN HAMMETT</HI> of the Town of <HI>Newport</HI> on <HI>Rhode-I&s;land,</HI> having furni&s;h|ed the World with an undoubted In&s;tance in his own Per&s;on, of a Man abundantly given to Change, hath penn'd and &s;ent to a certain Church Member, a few Days ago, a Paper, containing a Declaration or Confe&s;&s;ion of his Faith concerning our Lord and Saviour Je&s;us Chri&s;t; and having been &s;ince waited upon, hath owned it to be his Faith, not|with&s;tanding he hath not &s;ub&s;cribed it with his Name: And the &s;ame being in direct Oppo&s;ition to Twelve Arguments of his in a Manu&s;cript, now in Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of another of the Church Members, it is thought fit, for the Benefit of him&s;elf and others, to pre&s;ent the Contents of the &s;aid Papers to the Public; together with an Argument of his again&s;t the Divinity of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, taken from another of his own Manu&s;cripts. Only ad|verti&s;ing the Reader, That his a&s;&s;erting or &s;ugge&s;ting, that the Confe&s;&s;ion of his Faith, contained in his &s;aid Paper, <Q>always was
<PB N="4" REF="040687_0003_101680536C76B0C0">and is the Confe&s;&s;ion of Faith which is made and accepted by all our Churches to this Day,</Q> is certainly a very great Evil, fal&s;e in Fact, and di&s;honourable to the &s;aid Churches: Witne&s;s tho&s;e very Confe&s;&s;ions of Faith which have been reprinted here in <HI>Newport,</HI> and which any Man <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> compare with this of <HI>John Hammett,</HI> at Plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>However, for the Satisfaction of many Readers, and &s;aving them &s;ome Trouble, it is thought covenient to in&s;ert &s;ome Pa&s;&s;ages in this Place,</P>
<P>There is a Public Confe&s;&s;ion of Faith hanging up in a Frame in the Meeting Hou&s;e where <HI>J. Hammett</HI> u&s;ed to a&s;&s;emble, and which hath been there many Years, and hath been lately reprinted in <HI>Newport,</HI> by Mr. <HI>Franklin.</HI> The third Article whereof, &s;peaks thus: "That there is one Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t, by whom are all Things, who is the only begotten Son of God, born of the Virgin <HI>Mary;</HI> being the true Lord and <HI>Root of Da|vid,</HI> and al&s;o his Son and Offspring, accord|ing to the Fle&s;h; whom God freely &s;ent in|to the World, becau&s;e of his great Love to the World; who as freely gave him&s;elf a Ran&s;om for all, ta&s;ting Death for every Man,
<PB N="5" REF="040687_0004_101680566C009A48">a Propitiation for our Sins; and not for ours only, but al&s;o for the Sins of the whole World."</P>
<P>The &s;eventh Article of the &s;aid Confe&s;&s;ion, &s;peaks thus: "That there is one Holy Spirit, the <HI>precious</HI> Gift of God, freely given to &s;uch as obey him, <HI>Eph.</HI> 4.4. <HI>Acts</HI> 5.32. that thereby they may be throughly &s;ancti|fied, and made able (without which they are altogether unable) to abide &s;tedfa&s;t in the Faith, and to honour the Father and his Son Chri&s;t, the Author and Fini&s;her of their Faith, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 6.11. There are three that bear Record in Heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit, and the&s;e Three are One, 1 <HI>John</HI> 5.7."&mdash;</P>
<P>There is al&s;o a Public Confe&s;&s;ion of Faith &s;et forth by many of tho&s;e Bapti&s;ts who own the Doctrine of Univer&s;al Redemption; &s;ub&s;cribed by certain Me&s;&s;engers, Pa&s;tors, Deacons, and Brethren, met at <HI>London,</HI> in Behalf of them&s;elves, and many others, unto whom they did belong, in <HI>London,</HI> and in &s;everal Counties of the Nation, of the &s;ame Faith with them. Which Confe&s;&s;ion hath al&s;o been reprinted &s;ome Years ago in <HI>New|port,</HI> by Mr. <HI>J. Franklin.</HI> The fir&s;t Article
<PB N="6" REF="040687_0005_10168058940C2420">whereof, &s;peaks thus: "We believe, and are very confident, that there is One, and but One living and true God, who is from everla&s;ting to everla&s;ting, and changeth not; without Body, Parts, or Pa&s;&s;ions, e&s;&s;entially pre&s;ent in all Places, of infinite Power, Wi&s;dom, and Goodne&s;s; the Maker and Pre&s;erver of all Things in Heaven and Earth, Vi&s;ible and Invi&s;ible; and in this Divine and Infinite Being or Unity of the Godhead, there are Three Per&s;ons, the Fa|ther, Son, and Holy Gho&s;t, of one Sub&s;tance, Power, and Eternity: But as for all other Doctrines that are contrary and oppo&s;ite to this above&s;aid Article, we abhor and &s;o|lemnly prote&s;t again&s;t them."</P>
<P>The third Article of the &s;aid Confe&s;&s;ion is thus: "That the &s;econd Per&s;on in the Trinity, is the only begotten Son of God, who did in the Fulne&s;s of Time, take to him&s;elf of our Nature and Sub&s;tance, in the Womb of the ble&s;&s;ed Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> of whom (in Re&s;pect of the Fle&s;h) he was made, and &s;o is true God, and true Man, our <HI>Emanuel,</HI> Chri&s;t, whom God the Father freely &s;ent in|to the World, becau&s;e of his great Love to the World; who as freely gave him&s;elf a Ran&s;om for All"&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="040687_0006_1016805E730B0828">
This Confe&s;&s;ion of Faith being reduced to a &s;hort Compa&s;s, for the Benefit of weak Memories, and ignorant Per&s;ons: In that Form, the fir&s;t Article is thus. "There is one God, an Almighty, Eternal, Infinite, Good, Merciful, Righteous, and Holy Spirit, who made the World, and all Things there|in, out of Nothing; and is &s;upream Ruler and Governor thereof."</P>
<P>The &s;econd Article is thus. "This one God is di&s;tingui&s;hed into Three Per&s;ons, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Gho&s;t; the Father is the Creator, the Son the Redeemer, and the Holy Gho&s;t the Sanctifier."</P>
<P>To this, let it be added: There is another Confe&s;&s;ion of Faith publi&s;hed by a very great Number of Bapti&s;t Churches, that held the the Doctrine of Per&s;onal Election and Final Per&s;everance, cited by Mr. <HI>Jo&s;. Stennet</HI> in his An&s;wer to Mr. <HI>Ru&s;&s;en;</HI> which, as to the Matter in Hand, &s;aith, as cited by Mr. <HI>Sten|net,</HI> p. 112, 113. "The Son of God, the &s;econd Per&s;on in the Holy Trinity, being very and eternal God, the Brightne&s;s of the Father's Glory, of one Sub&s;tance, and equal with him; who made the World, who up|holdeth and governeth all Things he hath
<PB N="8" REF="040687_0007_1016806284B0AB18">made; did, when the Fulne&s;s of Time was come, take upon him Man's Nature, with all the e&s;&s;ential Properties, and common In|firmities thereof, yet without Sin, being conceived by the Holy Spirit in the Womb of the Virgin <HI>Mary;</HI>&mdash;and &s;o was made of a Woman of the Tribe of <HI>Judah,</HI> of the Seed of <HI>Abraham</HI> and <HI>David,</HI> according to the Scriptures. So that two whole, perfect, and di&s;tinct Natures were in&s;eparably join'd to|gether in one Per&s;on, without Conver&s;ion, Compo&s;ition, or Confu&s;ion; which Per&s;on is very God and very Man, yet one Chri&s;t, the only Mediator between God and Man."</P>

<HEAD><HI>J. Hammett</HI>'s Confe&s;&s;ion of Faith, taken from his own Manu&s;cript.</HEAD>
<P><HI>"FOra&s;much as there having been of late, certain Opinions, which both by preach|ing and writing, have been indu&s;triou&s;ly pro|pagated among us, which hath cau&s;ed &s;ome Unea|&s;ine&s;s, and hath put us upon diligently &s;earch|ing, and carefully examining, the plain Scrip|tures of the New-Te&s;tament; and from thence we have collected the following Declaration of our Faith, which having Chri&s;t and his Apo|&s;tles
<PB N="9" REF="040687_0008_1016806647D62A20">for its Foundation, we therefore hope it will &s;ufficiently protect us from the Imputation of Error; and al&s;o it may, by the Ble&s;&s;ing of God, be Serviceable to others: We thought our|&s;elves con&s;cientiou&s;ly oblig'd to make it public.</HI></P>
<P>THAT in Re&s;pect of the real Sub&s;tance, Nature, and E&s;&s;ence, of the true and only Chri&s;t, the only begotten Son of God, in whom God the Father dwelt, and to whom the Father gave the Spirit without Mea&s;ure, in whom the Godhead dwelt bodily, and in whom God was manife&s;t, and that God was in Chri&s;t, reconciling the World to him&s;elf, &s;o as there never was &s;uch a Union between God and any other Man.</P>
<P>Him the Scriptures declare to be the Seed of the Virgin, miraculou&s;ly conceiv'd in her Womb, by the Over&s;hadowing of the Holy Gho&s;t, and born of her Body, made of a Woman, and was the Son of Man, made like his Brethren in all Things, Sin only excepted; and was in all Points tempted like as we are, yet without Sin, liable to the Bodily Frailties of Human Nature, he being a Mortal Man, and for our Sins died on the Cro&s;s, whom God rai&s;ed from the
<PB N="10" REF="040687_0009_10168068D3495508">Dead, and exalted and dignified him far a|bove all others, whether in Heaven or in Earth, the Father only excepted: For God hath given him a Name, which is above every Name, that at the Name of Je&s;us, every Knee &s;hould bow, whether of Things in Heaven or Things on Earth; and to him God committed all Power in Heaven and in Earth; and al&s;o God hath appointed and ordained this extraordinary Per&s;on to execute tho&s;e two great Offices of a Mediator be|tween God and Man; and al&s;o that of a Judge of the final and everla&s;ting State of all Men: And this glorious and incompa|rable Per&s;on, the Scriptures thus de&s;cribes and &s;ets forth, to be the compleat and only Object of Faith, God the Father only ex|cepted; for Chri&s;t him&s;elf &s;aid, <HI>Ye believe in God, believe al&s;o in me:</HI> So that there is not any other Object of Faith recommended to us; for as to the Holy Gho&s;t, or Power of the Highe&s;t, 'tis evident, that the Highe&s;t was his Father, by who&s;e over&s;hadowing Power (to whom Nothing is impo&s;&s;ible) the Virgin conceived and brought forth her Son, and thus this Seed of the Woman, who was to brui&s;e the Serpent's Head, became the
<PB N="11" REF="040687_0010_1016806E66F51948">only begotten Son of God, according as the Angel &s;aid to <HI>Mary; That Holy Thing which &s;hall be born of thee, &s;hall be called the Son of God; and al&s;o he &s;hall be great, and &s;hall be called the Son of the Highe&s;t.</HI> And that we might not be mi&s;taken, by going farther back to find out his Original, or when he began to have a Being or Exi&s;tence, and thereby overlook him, and have our Eye on &s;ome other Object in&s;tead of him, the Holy Gho&s;t hath carefully provided again&s;t this Uncertainty, by informing us, That when he was di&s;puting the Doctors in the Temple, he was then about Twelve Years of Age; and when he was baptized of <HI>John</HI> in the Ri|ver of <HI>Jordan,</HI> he then began to be about Thirty Years of Age; &s;o that Chri&s;t the Son of God could not pre-exi&s;t, or exi&s;t, be|fore that Time, &s;aving in the Ordination or Pre-determination of God, who calleth Things that are not, as tho' they were; and in this Sen&s;e and Way of &s;peaking, he is &s;aid to be a <HI>Lamb &s;lain from the Foundation of the World,</HI> tho' 'tis evident, he was not really then in Being, much le&s;s to be then &s;lain or crucified. And al&s;o <HI>David</HI> &s;aid, <HI>Thou art my Son, this Day have I begotten thee:</HI>
<PB N="12" REF="040687_0011_1016806FF6A0A268">But both <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>Paul</HI> explains this to be prophetically &s;poken, and to refer to his be|ing begotten or rai&s;ed from the Dead. So Chri&s;t al&s;o que&s;tioning with the <HI>Jews,</HI> he asked them, <HI>If</HI> David <HI>in Spirit call him Lord, how is he then his Son?</HI> Had the&s;e <HI>Jews</HI> under&s;tood, that <HI>David</HI> &s;pake this in a pro|phetic Stile; that is, That he was in Proce&s;s of Time to be his Lord, and al&s;o his Son, tho' then he was really neither his Son nor his Lord, they need not to have been &s;o puzzled about this &s;o plain a Que&s;tion. And thus abundance of &s;eeming Difficulties may be ea&s;ily reconciled and under&s;tood; for we are not under the ignorant Uncertainty, that the Di&s;ciples of <HI>John</HI> were, when they asked Chri&s;t, <HI>Art thou he that &s;hould come, or do we look for another?</HI> but thanks be to God, we can &s;ay with <HI>Philip</HI> to <HI>Nathanael, We have found him, of whom</HI> Mo&s;es <HI>in the Law and the Prophets did write, Je&s;us of</HI> Nazareth. And this mean and low Character, tho' de|&s;pis'd by <HI>Nathanael</HI> as well as others, yet Chri&s;t was pleas'd particularly to chu&s;e above all others, to de&s;cribe him&s;elf by, when he appeared to <HI>Paul,</HI> tho' then in his mo&s;t ex|alted and re&s;plendant Glory; <HI>I am Je&s;us of</HI>
<PB N="13" REF="040687_0012_10168073076C2580">Nazareth! So that we are not a&s;hamed to own him, as being our great Lord and Ma|&s;ter; and in him therefore, we profe&s;s to believe, and with him we are fully &s;atisfied and contented; and therefore, we are not amu&s;ing and puzzling our&s;elves, by looking out for another Chri&s;t, or Son of God, whom we never expect to find; for on this very Faith of Chri&s;t's Human Per&s;onality and Sufferings, he hath expre&s;sly founded and e&s;tabli&s;hed the commemorative Communion, and as &s;uch, we all receive it. And al&s;o, that the Man Chri&s;t Je&s;us, whom the <HI>Jews</HI> crucified, and whom God rai&s;ed from the Dead, the Apo&s;tles went every where preach|ing to <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Gentiles,</HI> That he was the Son of God, and the only Saviour; and for this they &s;uffered abundance of Per&s;ecution: So that this was their chief and principal Doctrine of Faith, and accordingly this was the Profe&s;&s;ion of Faith which the primitive Converts made, and which was accepted by the Apo&s;tles on their Admi&s;&s;ion to Bapti&s;m; and &s;o this always was, and is the Confe&s;&s;ion of Faith which is made and accepted by all our Churches to this Day. <HI>Luke</HI> 6.22, 23. <HI>Ble&s;&s;ed are ye, when Men &s;hall hate you, and when they
