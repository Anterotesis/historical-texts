<HEAD>JULIA.</HEAD>
<P>IF thou art a Curate, O Reader, and ha&s;t already <HI>one</HI> pari&s;h in thy po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion, be contented, and &s;eek not to have <HI>two.</HI> Be a&s;&s;ured that contentment is better than to have <HI>two livings.</HI></P>
<P>Many good people be&s;ides Shake|&s;peare have been born upon the Avon; and one of them was the Curate of the Pari&s;h of Elmwood. Of a family of nine people, parents and children, only he and his daughter Julia remained.</P>
<P>This old Par&s;on could do many things be&s;ides eat his pudding, drink his Octo|ber (both which he loved affectionately), and collect his tithes;&mdash;tho&s;e important qualifications which have been, from time immemorial, annexed to the office of a Country Curate. He carried the Sciences in his head, and the Arts in his heart&mdash;I mean, &s;o far as they are connected with manners or &s;entiment. Be&s;ides all this he preached an excellent
<PB N="4" REF="035759_0003_10066822D0C93DC0">&s;ermon, wore his own gray hairs, and had the gout: but, above all, he loved, mo&s;t dearly loved, his daughter Julia.</P>
<P>And well did &s;he de&s;erve his love.&mdash; Sweet Maid! If ever I forget thee, may my fancy lo&s;e her flights, and my pen its movements! If ever I forget the maje&s;tic elegance of thy form&mdash;or the liquid blue &s;wimming in thy eye&mdash;or the half ro&s;e, half lily colours glowing in thy cheek, like the &s;treaks of the we&s;t in a July evening&mdash;Oh! if I remember not the lovely confu&s;ion o'er all thy fea|tures, when I fir&s;t beheld thee in the arms of thy Ravi&s;her&mdash;may I cea&s;e to dream of thee!&mdash;If I do not, Julia! may&s;t thou never think of me!</P>
<P>Such was the daughter of the Curate of Elmwood&mdash;a fair form, and a pure heart!&mdash;It was nouri&s;hed in the pure bo&s;om of a father.</P>
<P>Though the man&s;ion of the&s;e con|tented relations ro&s;e in the centre of the Pari&s;h, it was neither &s;tately nor proud: like its inhabitants, it was mode&s;t, and &s;eemed to retire into an ob&s;cure and
<PB N="5" REF="035759_0004_100668247AAAF778">&s;ilent glade, formed between various clumps of &s;hrubbery, and a ridge of ri&s;ing ground. At a &s;mall di&s;tance roll|ed the &s;ilver Avon, ever mu&s;ical, now mantling over a rocky channel, and now gliding through green plains and fields covered with wild flowers.</P>
<P>Through the&s;e fields, and along the&s;e &s;kirted banks, full oft did the Curate and his daughter pur&s;ue their walk. In that &s;weet hour of the evening, when the &s;un &s;eems dropping behind the hills, and throws a feeble but plea&s;ing beam o'er the land&s;cape, then might you &s;ee them walking arm in arm, and &s;lowly, on the Avon &s;ide. "Julia, (he would &s;ay to his daughter) my dear Julia, you and my Pari&s;h are the comfort of my life. Ye all are my children&mdash;but you, Julia, you are my Friend. The thir&s;ty loves not to drink, nor the weary to re&s;t, more than I love to look upon <HI>you.</HI> What would become of me, Julia, wert thou gone? and when I am gone, my daughter, what will become of thee?"&mdash;I hope, father, we &s;hall die
<PB N="6" REF="035759_0005_100668272F84C798">both together,"&mdash;"God grant it! God grant it!" an&s;wered the old man.</P>
<P>Thus peaceably glided on their lives, till an unlucky accident in the neigh|bouring pari&s;h di&s;turbed their tranquil|ity. The Vicar of that pari&s;h died. Now, the moment our Curate was in|formed of this, it rou&s;ed one of his wor&s;t pa&s;&s;ions: he had now but one wi&s;h to be gratified in this world; and that was&mdash;to have the neighbouring vicarage in his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. "My dear father (&s;aid the unambitious Julia), have we not competence? and does not com|petence afford us happine&s;s? and is not this &s;ufficient?"&mdash;Ay, all that was very true: but then the vicarage lay &s;o &s;nug ju&s;t at his own door; and he wanted to have it in his power to leave &s;omething to his Julia after his death; and, now that he was &s;o very old, and &s;o very gouty, what a comfortable thing it would be to have a Curate under him, to perform &s;ervice when he was confined at home! The thing was evidently a &s;nug thing, and would be very conve|nient:
<PB N="7" REF="035759_0006_10066829E0A62780">be&s;ides, he knew the Patron of the living&mdash;he had been his &s;chool fel|low&mdash;as good a nobleman as ever was born&mdash;he was certain of &s;ucce&s;s&mdash;It was impo&s;&s;ible that he could not &s;ucceed&mdash;he had &s;et his heart upon the thing&mdash;and Julia, his child, could not oppo&s;e it.</P>
<P>Here he was right. Julia would &s;ooner have expired at his feet. She yielded the point with a &s;mile.</P>
<P>But much remained yet to be done. The Curate had talked like a man un|acquainted with calculations, and his fancy (old as it was) got the &s;tart of his judgment. He did not con&s;ider that Lord C&mdash;, the patron of the liv|ing, re&s;ided at London, and that his own limbs were too gouty to carry him thither&mdash;for per&s;onal application is ab|&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary in the&s;e ca&s;es: be&s;ides, the Clergy, though they are continually advi&s;ing their flocks to keep their eyes fixed upon the good things of Heaven only, have a &s;trange trick of keeping their own eyes con&s;tantly fixed upon the good things of this earth:
<PB N="8" REF="035759_0007_1006682B662AA910">every moment, therefore, was impor|tant; to lo&s;e a minute was to lo&s;e the Curacy; and while he was talking, &s;ome other reverend brother, who had no gout in his toes, no daughter to provide for, no want of an a&s;&s;i&s;tant Curate, might be po&s;ting to his Lord|&s;hip in Berkely Square.</P>
<P>The old man became now greatly agitated; and that bo&s;om which ought to have been the man&s;ion of re&s;ignation and peace, was di&s;turbed by re&s;tle&s;s wi&s;hes and ill timed de&s;pair. The &s;ympathetic &s;oul of Julia was rou&s;ed; her heart throbbed with guiltle&s;s pangs, and &s;he felt for the griefs of her father. She tried to &s;oothe him, but tried in vain: &s;he argued again&s;t his wi&s;hes, but &s;he was arguing again&s;t the follies of old age, which are incurable. The Curacy was lo&s;t, and he was re&s;olved to bewail it.</P>
<P>The evening came, but came not as u&s;ual; this man of de&s;pair was uncon|&s;cious of its charms. His &s;oul was deaf to the voice of Nature, even when her
<PB N="9" REF="035759_0008_1006682D29313638">notes were &s;weete&s;t&mdash;at the clo&s;e of the day. He li&s;tened not to the carols of the hinds, nor to the ru&s;tic mu&s;ic of the fields: the flocks clu&s;tered in the mead|ows unnoticed; and the &s;un poured his evening glories over the land&s;cape un|regarded. Even Julia did not charm him: he &s;aw her kneel at his &s;ide with|out emotion, and he heard her &s;ighs in &s;ilence.</P>
<P>Here a father and a friend was lo&s;t to happine&s;s&mdash;the only friend too &s;he had in the world&mdash;and &s;orrows much le&s;s than the&s;e would have murdered the peace of Julia. She had already knelt by the &s;ide of her father: &s;he now cla&s;ped his hand clo&s;ely in her own, and fixing her blue eyes pathetically on his countenance, begged that he would not refu&s;e her one reque&s;t&mdash; "What was that?"&mdash;To permit <HI>her</HI> to go to London, in que&s;t of the Curacy.</P>
<P>Electricity could not touch him quicker. The voice of Julia was pa|thetic, and it awakened him. His af|fections returned in an in&s;tant: he lean|ed
<PB N="10" REF="035759_0009_1006682FDDB485D0">over his daughter, and gave her to under&s;tand that it was impo&s;&s;ible to grant her reque&s;t; that he would not part with her for a Bi&s;hopric; and that &s;he mu&s;t not think to part with him. She replied; he an&s;wered; and &s;he re-an&s;wered: in &s;hort, the conte&s;t was long, &s;tubborn and eloquent; and though there was not much learning in it, it abounded with nature, a richer quality. Suffice it to &s;ay that Julia con|quered; and &s;he obtained with great difficulty what &s;he called the honourable office of being her father's me&s;&s;enger.</P>
<P>It has been ob&s;erved already that di&s;|patch is one of the few roads to prefer|ment. As no time was therefore to be lo&s;t, it was agreed upon that &s;he &s;hould &s;et off the next morning. The War|wick &s;tage pa&s;&s;ed through the neigh|bouring market town, and &s;he might walk thither to meet it. The old man retired to get ready his letters, and Julia to make her little preparations for her journey.</P>
<P>How they &s;lept, them&s;elves know
<PB N="11" REF="035759_0010_100668328F7A3050">be&s;t; but when the morning came, the Curate's opinions were entirely changed. "He had thought better upon the &s;ub|ject, and he was re&s;olved not to let her go. The roads were dangerous, and London was &s;till more &s;o&mdash;be&s;ides, &s;he might turn &s;ick&mdash;or the coach might be overturned&mdash;&s;he might be killed&mdash;and he would never &s;ee her more." Julia knew that the&s;e fears were only the tender works of timid nature, and &s;he oppo&s;ed them. In &s;hort, the conte&s;t was renewed with its former warmth; and the affection of the daughter tri|umphed once more over the tenderne&s;s of the Father. He con&s;ented again to let her go, on condition that <HI>Joe</HI> (his labourer, his gardener, his footman, his ho&s;tler, his every thing) &s;hould at|tend her with his friendly care&mdash;&s;hould be the companion of her journey.</P>
<P>Now this <HI>Joe</HI> was the awkwarde&s;t mortal&mdash;Never, &s;ure, did a more &s;im|ple &s;quire page it at the heels of a fair lady. Neither the Sancho of Don Quixote, nor the Pedrillo of Ro&s;alva,
<PB N="12" REF="035759_0011_100668341290E248">were more arrant children of Nature&mdash; were guided by more native &s;implicity. He and his occupation &s;eemed made for each other, &s;o exactly were they re|&s;pectively fitted. He was never fa|mous but for two things; viz. for whi&s;tling, after his team, the loude&s;t and mo&s;t mu&s;ical notes of any in the whole village&mdash;and for knitting &s;tock|ings: this was all the reputation he had in the world; and he was now going to &s;et out for London (where he had never been) in high expectation of &s;eeing fine things and fine folks, but without any idea of receiving treatment different from what he met with in the pari&s;h of Elmwood.</P>
<P>Now, reader, &s;top a moment, and bethink thee of this plan and of this journey; and then confe&s;s that they were highly worthy of the politic heads which gave them birth. A village vir|gin, attended by a village boor&mdash;both equally accu&s;tomed to travelling, and the bu&s;tle of an Engli&s;h turnpike road&mdash; both equally &s;killed in the knowledge
<PB N="13" REF="035759_0012_10066835969CE8F0">of men and of their characters&mdash;are &s;etting our for London&mdash;for <HI>London,</HI> I &s;ay&mdash;in que&s;t of a Curacy! The thing was worthy of a Village Curate. The de&s;cent of Eneas into Hell was, in com|pari&s;on of this, walking upon carpets.</P>
<Q><L>Facilis de&s;cen&s;us Averni,</L>
<L>Sed revocare gradum&mdash;</L></Q>
<P>Our travellers were now ready to be|gin their walk to the market town, which was but four miles di&s;tant. Without palfrey, armour, or other ret|inue than the children of the neigh|bourhood (who regarded Julia as the good and fair Genius of the village) the cavalcade &s;et out. Julia and her father led the van, and the re&s;t followed. Joe, as if con&s;cious that he was entering upon a &s;ervice of danger, a&s;&s;umed a &s;tatelier port and a more augu&s;t vi&s;age; and, with a clean &s;hirt in his left pocket, much good bacon and chee&s;e in his right, and a lu&s;ty &s;apling in his hand, he towered maje&s;tic forward in the mid&s;t of the children, with &s;tern a&s;pect and long &s;trides.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="035759_0013_100668371FB4DA10">
The company had now walked a mile, and were to part. On this trying occa&s;ion I could &s;ay much, but will not. To de&s;cribe the glances of affection and the looks of love which gli&s;tened in every eye, which played in every fea|ture, would be extremely tedious to many of my gentle readers: I &s;hall therefore content my&s;elf with informing them, that in this difficult &s;cene the &s;imple heart of the Curate failed him; his eyes confe&s;&s;ed it, and he played the woman. The ender Julia caught the &s;oft contagion; and from her it pa&s;&s;ed to the little villagers who compo&s;ed her train. Joe, who now &s;aw what was pa&s;&s;ing all around him, was not willing to be &s;ingular: his eye forgot its haugh|tine&s;s for a moment, and he mixed his plaintive notes in the concert of woe.&mdash; Thus they are all crying together.</P>
<P>But the&s;e lamentations were &s;oon over. The Curate, taking his daugh|ter by the hand, &s;howered ble&s;&s;ings and advices upon her in great plenty; told her to be cautious, prudent and expedi|tious;
<PB N="15" REF="035759_0014_1006683B0615FBC0">that while &s;he took care of her|&s;elf, &s;he was &s;erving him; and then again wi&s;hing her ten thou&s;and ble&s;&s;ings, bade his child adieu. The Curate marched &s;lowly back at the head of his young flock, and our two travellers &s;es forward to the market town with a ha&s;ty pace and high expectations.</P>
<P>Having now begun a journey, we mu&s;t be expeditious. They arrived at the market town, met the &s;tage coach, and took their re&s;pective &s;tations&mdash;Julia in the in&s;ide, and Joe, like her guardian angel, perched above her upon the top. Now why &s;hould I loiter to rehear&s;e the trivial adventures of a &s;tage-coach journey&mdash;how, always as town ro&s;e to view after town, hill after hill, and county after county, the &s;pirits of Joe ro&s;e in proportion, and &s;till he whi&s;tled on both loud and long, like the lark at day break; or how, though all the &s;illy people in the coach &s;tared continually at Julia, the timid Julia dur&s;t not &s;tare at them? or why &s;hould I relate the idle &s;mall talk, the impu|dent
<PB N="16" REF="035759_0015_1006683C8B15AD50">regard, and the uncourteous gal|lantry, with which &s;he was entertained by a fooli&s;h officer of the guards (tho&s;e coxcomb troops), who is well known to be a fop in the Drawing room and a fribble on the Parade? Otherwi&s;e they went &s;moothly on, till they arrived at the Lane which is three miles on the we&s;t &s;ide of Uxbridge; when a very civil gentleman came to the window, and de&s;ired them to give him all the money they had. The gentleman at the window was far from being unpo|lite, con&s;idering he had declared war again&s;t Society. He be&s;poke them very gently, beginning at the right hand, and following them all, man by man, and woman by woman, till he went round to the left &s;ide. The officer was unhappily fir&s;t, and he gave his pur&s;e with a &s;ullen &s;ilence. Julia was next, and held her little money in her hand, but dur&s;t not look towards the window. A meagre cockney gave all, but begged a few &s;hillings back to carry him to St. Paul's. A little fat woman
<PB N="17" REF="035759_0016_1006683E0FE0E930">&s;urrendered her pur&s;e with a threat; and a plain dre&s;&s;ed man regretted he had not more for &s;o civil a gentleman.</P>
<P>When they arrived at the inn at the next &s;tage, each one expre&s;&s;ed his &s;or|rows as his feelings prompted: but they were now to enter upon their la&s;t &s;tage, and none had &s;uch weighty cau&s;e to be aggrieved as Julia, who had not a friend before her. To go forward was madne&s;s, and to go back was impo&s;&s;i|ble. What was &s;he to do?&mdash;She called in Joe, and a&s;ked if he had provided him&s;elf with any money, in ca&s;e of an emergency.&mdash;"Yes, that he had&mdash;and there it was at her &s;ervice,"&mdash;throwing down his entire flock upon the table, which in the whole amounted to the &s;um of three &s;hillings and nine pence. This made de&s;pair more black. It was her fir&s;t misfortune; and &s;he thought it but a rough entrance into the world, for one who never de&s;erved it.</P>
<P>The officer now entered the room; and &s;eeing Joe there, began to upbraid him for &s;uffering the highway man to e&s;cape,
<PB N="18" REF="035759_0017_10066840B8C23A48">when he was &s;eated &s;o advantageou&s;ly at the top, with an oaken &s;apling in his hand&mdash;"You &s;tupid oaf! (&s;aid this military hero) why did you not attack him?"&mdash;"'Ca&s;e I had not a &s;word by my &s;ide, like you (replied Joe, with the greate&s;t frankne&s;s)&mdash;he&mdash;he&mdash;he! icod every man to his traid, mea&s;ter!"&mdash;The&s;e arguments were unan&s;werable.</P>
<P>The officer now walked up to Julia, who&s;e embarra&s;&s;ment he perceived; and taking her a&s;ide, told her he gue&s;&s;ed the cau&s;e of her &s;orrow, and that he was happy he had it in his power to remove it: "for (continued he) I know the road too well to venture my all upon it, and to leave my&s;elf unprovided with re&s;ouces. Here (&s;ays he, untying his &s;tock, and &s;haking out of it a &s;lender green pur&s;e) here is my <HI>corps de re&s;erve:</HI> I gave the robber a few &s;hillings, and I &s;ecured this for your u&s;e." Now Julia examined the face of this affair &s;imply as it &s;tood. It was a ca&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity; and &s;he thought it ridiculous for one who was many, many miles from Elm|wood,
<PB N="19" REF="035759_0018_10066842411FA4B8">and who had not two pence in her pocket, to refu&s;e the loan of a few guineas, which would remove all her &s;orrows. She might probably have an opportunity of hinting the matter to Lord C&mdash;when &s;he &s;aw him, who would no doubt advance the money upon the Curacy and thus all would be right again. She therefore thanked him politely, and told him that when &s;he &s;aw her noble friend Lord C&mdash;, &s;he hoped to be able to repay him. "Lord C&mdash;! (&s;ays he)&mdash;what&mdash;you are going to vi&s;it him?"&mdash;Yes, Sir.&mdash;"O&mdash;a relation I pre&s;ume, Madam?" No, Sir&mdash;only a friend: his Lord&s;hip and my father were great friends when they were young, and at &s;chool&mdash;"Ay, ay&mdash;your father, I pre&s;ume, Madam, lives in the country?"&mdash;Yes, Sir; he's Curate of Elmwood, near &mdash;in Warwick&s;hire. "Your vi&s;it, Ma'am&mdash;is it a vi&s;it of plea&s;ure or bu&s;i|ne&s;s?"&mdash;Bu&s;ine&s;s, Sir: I am only come to town with a letter from my father to Lord C&mdash;to &s;olicit the Curacy of
<PB N="20" REF="035759_0019_10066844ED9A29F0">&mdash;.&mdash;" O I under&s;tand you, Ma'am. Lord C&mdash;is my particular acquaintance, and it will give me plea&s;|ure to be your protector and your guide, till I deliver you &s;afely and hon|ourably to his Lord&s;hip.&mdash;Would you choo&s;e to alight, Ma'am, at any particular place in London?"&mdash;No (&s;aid the &s;imple Julia) I intend to &s;tay at the Inn all night, and to wait upon his Lord&s;hip in the morning.&mdash;" Ah! Madam (replied the officer), you do not know the confu&s;ion, the di&s;gu&s;t, and danger which you will meet with at the Inn: I have a mother in town, who lives elegantly: be prevailed upon to be lodged this night at her hou&s;e. She will receive you with cheerfulne&s;s, and treat you with tenderne&s;s. May I peri&s;h, Madam&mdash;may I beg the honour to know your name, Madam?"&mdash;Julia. &mdash;"May I peri&s;h, Mi&s;s Julia, but I am intere&s;ted in your ca&s;e as &s;incerely as if you was my &s;i&s;ter!" This la&s;t pro|po&s;al was better and better. To meet &s;o good a friend at once!&mdash;She was cer|tain
<PB N="21" REF="035759_0020_1006684672B19D88">her father's prayers for her were heard; and &s;he thought &s;he could not be too thankful to Heaven&mdash;nor to the Gentleman. She accepted his officer; and they mounted the &s;tage coach once more.</P>
<P>As the &s;tage coachman was at this place paid his full demands, there was nothing to be done but to roll into town, and go where they plea&s;ed. The fat woman lived in Holborn, and the coach &s;topt to &s;et her down. "Here too, Madam (&s;aid the officer to Julia), we may get out for we are near our home." The artful abruptne&s;s and hurry of the &s;ummons&mdash;the con&s;ciou&s;|ne&s;s of finding her&s;elf &s;uddently in the mid&s;t of the immen&s;e metropolis, where &s;he already &s;aw &s;trange things, and expected to &s;ee &s;till &s;tranger&mdash;her total ignorance of every thing around her&mdash;her hopes&mdash;her expectations&mdash;her &s;implicity&mdash;all contributed to throw her mind into confu&s;ion, her &s;pirits into a flutter: &s;he forgot every thing&mdash;&s;he forgot even Joe&mdash;and Joe, alas! forgot
<PB N="22" REF="035759_0021_1006684932B6BE08">her; for he was exactly in the &s;ame predicamant. He was a&s;toni&s;hed: he was in a new world: his recollection for&s;ook him, and a mi&s;t wandered over his eyes: he &s;et nailed to the top of the coach, with his mouth open, looking at every thing, and &s;eeing nothing. In this cloud Julia e&s;caped; and &s;he nei|ther &s;poke nor looked around her, till her gallant commander led her into Lin|coln's Inn Fields&mdash;Now when a young Gentleman, with a young Lady by his &s;ide, who is re&s;olved to follow him, finds him&s;elf in Lincoln's Inn Fields, the road to Covent Garden lies direct: 'tis only going up Queen &s;treet, cro&s;&s;ing the <HI>Lane</HI> and the <HI>Acre,</HI> and you're there. He conducted her into that well known hou&s;e &s;ituate between the gate of the Theatre and the Piazza Coffee hou&s;e. The polite inhabitants of this hou&s;e received the young gentleman with all the freedom and civility of an old ac|quaintance, which convinced Julia that he was <HI>quite at home.</HI></P>
<P>Now, gentle reader, while Julia and

<P>Julia drank very &s;paringly, but not &s;o her companion; he was to attempt the gaining of a difficult po&s;t, and the coward wanted &s;pirits. It is a tribute paid to virtue, that, though it be lodg|ed in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of but a frail and weak woman, its &s;poiler, before he at|tempts

The &s;econd bottle began to tune the &s;pirits of our Hero: his veins &s;welled, his pul&s;e quickened, his eyes gli&s;tened, and his cheek glowed: he &s;natched the hand of Julia, fed upon it with fury, and devoured it with a tumult of unholy love: if indeed he loved Julia, it was with the love of a tyger.</P>
<P>She &s;tarted from his embraces, and retreated &s;ome paces from her chair. He followed, and renewed the attack, and Julia her re&s;i&s;tance: he grew &s;tronger, he grew wilder, his hand was wandering over her charms (where hand never wandered before), and he became furious; Julia became faint&mdash;&s;he was yielding&mdash;her tender frame was exhau&s;t|ed, and &s;he could now only &s;hriek. A &s;hriek was a new thing in the&s;e apart|ments, and it alarmed a gentleman in the adjoining room, who, with his coat off, a dirty boot on one leg, and his face glowing and be&s;meared with &s;weat,

The Officer let go his hold of Julia, and &s;he threw her&s;elf breathle&s;s upon a chair. The man in di&s;habille &s;tared at them both alternately, now at Julia, and now at the Officer, and at length broke &s;ilence:</P>
<P>"What! force!&mdash;Why, thou dam|nable and &s;illy animal, what a dirty bu&s;ine&s;s is this you are engaged in&mdash; <HI>forcing</HI> a woman to your wi&s;hes!&mdash;To <HI>force</HI> a woman in any place is a mean|ne&s;s that no man of honour will &s;toop to&mdash;but to force one <HI>here</HI> in <HI>this</HI> hou&s;e&mdash; D-mn&mdash;n! you &s;coundrel! get out&mdash; walk off, or I'll kick you."</P>
<P>We need not be &s;urprized that the Officer was mean enough to take his advice. He looked at the man in di&s;ha|bille as if he had recollected &s;omething, and left the room precipitately.</P>

Julia told him he could not &s;erve her more agreeably than by carrying her to the Inn where the &s;tage and Joe were. That, he &s;aid, was more than he dur&s;t do; but he would carry her to a place equally or more &s;ecure. So &s;aying, he returned to his room, to throw off part of his <HI>road dre&s;s,</HI> and adju&s;t the re&s;t.</P>
<P>If the Reader has a fancy worth two pence, he will conceive how Julia's thoughts were employed in this interval, till they are interrupted by the en|trance of the highwayman, who appear|ed now to be a hand&s;ome and genteel young fellow. He paid the reckoning, and they departed: it was now between nine and ten in the evening.</P>
<P>They had not quitted the Piazza, when four of Sir John Fielding's men ru&s;hed forward, and &s;eized the high|wayman with the mo&s;t incredible activi|ty. They &s;wept him away, as the whirlwind &s;weeps away the leaves in autumn, and whirls them, the Lord knows

She continued to go forward (as &s;he thought), till &s;he had run a great way; and then &s;topping for breath, &s;he was exactly on the &s;pot from whence &s;he &s;et out&mdash;&s;he had only run <HI>round</HI> the Garden, not &s;u&s;pecting but &s;he was going forward in a &s;traight line. "Madam! Madam! (&s;ays an Iri&s;h chairman to her) do you want a chair?" I don't know what I want.

<P>She had been hitherto overwhelmed in a kind of in&s;en&s;ibility: the &s;udden|ne&s;s and horror of the la&s;t adventure were too powerful for her; her faculties lo&s;t their power, and her recollection was &s;u&s;pended; &s;he was led by the watchman without &s;eeing whither &s;he was going, and &s;he was dragged along without feeling that he held her by the arm. But &s;he had not been long &s;eated at the top of the bench, where they placed her near the fire, before &s;he awakened from her &s;tupor. She awakened, looked around, and &s;aw her&s;elf &s;eated in the mid&s;t of a horrible a&s;&s;embly, who&s;e vi&s;ages would

<P>"Ay, that I will, Mi&s;ter Con&s;table; the patten will &s;peak for it&s;elf, and a damn'd heavy patten it is."</P>
<P>Dick &s;tooped for it, but Julia <HI>wore no pattens.</HI></P>
<P>"Ah, the cunning Devil! (continu|ed Dick) &s;he has thrown them away. I thought I heard her throw &s;omething away as we came along.</P>

<P>As Julia was returning to her bench, &s;he trembled ince&s;&s;antly, but never ut|tered

<P>"Ay, ay, (&s;ays the Con&s;table) there's no doubt but &s;he'll drink; and it's her turn now to &s;end out.

<P>When this oration was fini&s;hed, Scout made his obei&s;ance to Julia.&mdash;She was ju&s;t able to a&s;k him what he wanted?&mdash;

<P>Julia felt in her pocket for her pur&s;e (which the highwayman had given her) but &s;he could not find it&mdash;it was gone:</P>
<P>On &s;eeing this, the Pre&s;ident bawled out immediately, that it was "a &s;ham!" and Julia prote&s;ted in vain. The com|pany around heard this with an arch &s;mile; the watchmen &s;hook their heads, and the Con&s;table grew noi&s;y; which awakened an old gentleman who had hitherto &s;tept very &s;oundly in a corner. E&s;timating the thing as favour|ably as po&s;&s;ible, he had not above half the appearance of a gentleman. The truth is, he was no other than the well known Mr. B&mdash; who once had three thou&s;and a year, though he has not now &s;ixty; but being a man of plain man|ners and a generous di&s;po&s;ition, is &s;till
<PB N="37" REF="035759_0036_10066868FA4C3D78">well received among his relations, and &s;trangers who know him. He had been lounging, as u&s;ual, for eight or nine hours, in a Coffee hou&s;e in the Garden, and then withdrew, as he frequently does, to the watch hou&s;e, either to &s;leep or drink. On this la&s;t account, he was re|garded there with &s;ome degree of re&s;pect.</P>
<P>He naturally inquired the cau&s;e of the noi&s;e; and the majority informed him, that it was "only a <HI>Madam</HI> there, who pretended &s;he had lo&s;t her pur&s;e." Julia now appealed to him in her turn; and, with that unaffected &s;implicity which ever clothes the words of inno|cence and truth, informed him, that a watchman had taken hold of her unex|pectedly in the &s;treet; that &s;he was po&s;|itive &s;he had her pur&s;e at that time, <HI>be|cau&s;e a gentleman had given it to her but two minutes before;</HI> that from that time &s;he had only walked thither with the watchman, and now &s;he mi&s;&s;ed her mon|ey."</P>

<P><PB N="38" REF="035759_0037_1006686A9D6836A8">
"Me&mdash;" replied Snoring Dick boldly.</P>

<P>"No&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Why then, Mr. Con&s;table, I charge you with&mdash;"</P>
<P>"Except indeed (interrupts Dick eagerly) &s;omething that I picked up on the &s;treet, as I was coming along with that there lady."</P>
<P>"Ah, you old fox! (&s;aid the gentle|man) I thought I &s;hould unkennel you. Where is this <HI>&s;omething</HI> which you <HI>picked up from the &s;treet?"</HI></P>
<P>"Here it is&mdash;but it does not belong to her."</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="035759_0038_1006686E76C66660">
"Pray, Madam (&s;aid Mr. B&mdash;, addre&s;&s;ing Julia) is this your pur&s;e?"</P>

<P>It had &s;o, was delivered to her, and Mr. B&mdash;immediately retired back into his corner to &s;leep.</P>
<P>Julia now willingly paid all the de|mands made upon her; and the Pre&s;i|dent ob&s;erved to her, "that as to be &s;ure as how &s;he was a good natured lady, and civil, and all them there things, and had <HI>given a good account</HI> of her&s;elf, why, to be &s;ure, &s;he might now go about her bu&s;ine&s;s."</P>
<P>Julia thanked him, but n. entioned, that &s;he did not know whither to go till morning. "Not know! (&s;aid the Con&s;table)&mdash;why there are five hundred beds round you, where you may &s;leep for half a crown."&mdash;But &s;he was a &s;tranger in town, and did not choo&s;e to venture into &s;trange hou&s;es.</P>
<P>"Lord, Ma'am, (ob&s;erved Snoring Dick) for &s;ixpence I'll conduct you to a

<P>This propo&s;al did not require to be repeated. Julia took him at his word. Even though he took her pur&s;e, as he was a poor man, &s;he thought &s;he might be &s;afe in his hou&s;e for a night. Be&s;ides, &s;he was plea&s;ed with the thoughts of be|ing in company with a woman once more. With Dick, therefore, &s;he went into one of the little &s;treets behind Long Acre, and followed him into a three pair of &s;tairs room, humble enough, indeed, but where all was &s;ilence. Dick awakened his wife, told her the &s;tory, whi&s;pered to her to look &s;harp after her lodger, and left them.</P>
<P>Julia chatted a little while with her landlady, and found her to be civil
<PB N="41" REF="035759_0040_10066871C8476A50">enough, for a watchman's wife. The fir&s;t thing &s;he begged of her was to be favoured with pen, ink, and paper. She got the&s;e readily; the landlady re|tired to bed; and Julia wrote the fol|lowing letter:</P>
<P>"Ah! my dear father, &s;hall we ever meet again?&mdash;When &s;hall we meet&mdash;?&mdash; Are you well?&mdash;Shall I ever &s;ee you? and ah! &s;hall you ever &s;ee me?</P>

<PB N="43" REF="035759_0042_10066877374F6898">and as it is at this moment many a no|bler fellow's) to be &s;itting in that lofty habitation called a garret, plunged in deep di&s;tre&s;s&mdash;no two pence in your pur&s;e, no mirth in your heart, and no beef in your belly&mdash;when, throwing your eyes around the rayle&s;s walls, you are con&s;cious that &s;ighs and tears are the only commodities in plenty about you&mdash;if this has been your ca&s;e, you mu&s;t well know the comfort that ari&s;es from &s;hed|ding your &s;orrows in &s;ecret&mdash;the relief that flows from a &s;hower of &s;olitary tears. In &s;uch a &s;ituation, next to in|&s;tantaneous and ab&s;olute relief, it is the fir&s;t of ble&s;&s;ings, and Julia now felt it in all its force. Her heart was ea&s;ed, and &s;he hoped for a night of re&s;t and for better days. Having then &s;ealed up her letter, &s;he retired to a bed &s;o humble that it ki&s;&s;ed the very ground.</P>
<P>Watching and grief had given her too good an appetite for &s;leep not to en|joy it. Whether or not &s;he dreamed, I cannot really inform my reader, becau&s;e &s;he never informed my&s;elf of this cir|cum&s;tance.
<PB N="44" REF="035759_0043_10066878C099BB78">This I know, that &s;he &s;lept nine hours ince&s;&s;antly, and, when &s;he awoke, found her head re&s;ting upon the partition wall which ro&s;e at the back of her bed. It con&s;i&s;ted only of a &s;ingle file of boards, and was full of crevices. Her ear lay upon one of them, and it conveyed to her the mo&s;t doleful accents that ever &s;truggled from the human brea&s;t. She &s;tarted, and applied her eye to the crevice, but every thing was &s;olitary: &s;he &s;aw no one. The voice cea&s;ed. It cea&s;ed only for a moment. Again it murmurs, weeps, laments, &s;obs, and again it cea&s;es. Her &s;ympa|thetic &s;oul followed it through all its va|riations; and, led by a &s;oft humanity, &s;he mourned with the mourner through every change of his woe. She applied her eye a &s;econd time, but could &s;ee nothing. A moment after, the voice was renewed. It was now more queru|lous, then more plaintive, and at length died away upon her ear, as if it had expired for want of &s;trength. She heard it no more.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="035759_0044_1006687A43879C38">
For the pre&s;ent, Julia &s;uppre&s;&s;ed her feelings, and aro&s;e. Snoring Dick had retired for an hour, to &s;leep away the fatigues of the night and of the beer-pot. His wife was at breakfa&s;t, (tea) and invited Julia to partake. She con|&s;ented willingly; and the woman, who had but one di&s;h, politely offered it to her gue&s;t, and took for her own u&s;e a pint pot from which her hu&s;band had been drinking beer.</P>
<P>This repa&s;t over, Dick awakened; and Julia, who was during breakfa&s;t-time devi&s;ing what mea&s;ures to follow, propo&s;ed at fir&s;t to engage him to go along with her to the inn where Joe and the &s;tage coach were; but on recollect|ing the dangers &s;he had already experi|enced in the &s;treets, &s;he re&s;olved not to venture upon it again, without a better guide than her friend the watchman. She therefore judged it more prudent to hire him to go to the inn, and to bring Joe along with him to the place where &s;he was. Dick readily a&s;&s;ented to this propo&s;al, for the hire of a half
<PB N="46" REF="035759_0045_1006687CF3379E38">crown; which, he &s;tipulated, &s;hould be paid him before he &s;et off, as well as the crown for the bed. All this he re|cieved on the &s;pot, with the letter for her father to be put into the Po&s;t Office. He now departed, a&s;&s;uring her, that though &s;he had not the name of the inn to give him, he could di&s;cover it.</P>
<P>This bu&s;ine&s;s happily adju&s;ted, the groans in the adjoining apartment ro&s;e upon Julia's mind. She had purpo&s;ely delayed her inquiries till Dick's depar|ture, whom &s;he knew to be unble&s;&s;ed with humanity. His wife, by a &s;ofter temper and a more complacent behav|iour, had recommended her&s;elf better to the ob&s;ervation of Julia, and &s;he re|&s;erved her &s;ympathies for her ear. A&s;&s;uming, therefore, that eager and &s;erious a&s;pect which the face wears when we are in earne&s;t, &s;he inquired who were the inhabitants of the neighbour|ing man&s;ion? "An old man, (an&s;wered the woman) who I fancy is &s;ometimes in di&s;tre&s;s; but we have too many wants of our own to mind any others."&mdash;In|different
<PB N="47" REF="035759_0046_1006687FA41B60B0">as the woman was when &s;he &s;aid this, Julia felt her&s;elf intere&s;ted, and conceived much more than was ex|pre&s;&s;ed. Seeing her ho&s;te&s;s not very fond of &s;ocial woe, &s;he &s;uppre&s;&s;ed her emotions, and in a &s;hort time after &s;tole out into the &s;tair ca&s;e. The door of the man in di&s;tre&s;s was exactly oppo&s;ite to the watchman's, and &s;he gently knock|ed at it. There was no an&s;wer. She knocked more loudly, but all was &s;ilence.&mdash;"Alas! (&s;aid &s;he to her&s;elf) if your grief is pa&s;t utterance, I mu&s;t enter without leave." She rai&s;ed the latch, and entered.&mdash;It was a piteous &s;ight, and worthy of the tears of tho&s;e bright eyes which now &s;hed them &s;o plentifully. Imagine in your own mind, this lovely girl bending over a bed, which contain|ed in it, &s;tretched along under a tattered rug, a man upon who&s;e features Heaven &s;eemed to have poured its bittere&s;t pangs. He was alive, but had cea&s;ed to groan becau&s;e he could groan no longer. In his arms were two chil|dren. His left was circled round one
<PB N="48" REF="035759_0047_1006688128AECB80">who was a&s;leep,&mdash;his right round one who was&mdash;dead. He gazed upon Julia without any emotion, and made not an effort to move even his head. He looked as if he was RESIGNATION. That great Poet who &s;uffered no &s;cene of the &s;oul and no &s;ituation of nature to e&s;cape him, has almo&s;t de&s;cribed him. He &s;eemed.</P>
<Q><L>&mdash;to pine in thought,</L>
<L>And, with a green and yellow melancholy,</L>
<L>He lay like Patience on a monument,</L>
<L>Smiling at Grief.</L>
<BIBL>SHAKESPEARE.</BIBL></Q>
<P>Here was that fea&s;t of exqui&s;ite grief, that luxury of &s;en&s;ibility, which is fit only for tho&s;e exalted &s;ouls who move in the higher departments of humanity&mdash;It was fit for Julia.</P>
<P>At length Julia &s;poke. "Poor&mdash;poor man! what can relieve you?"&mdash;He &s;hook his head&mdash;<HI>Nothing.</HI> Here Julia's &s;ympathy once more broke loo&s;e: her tears poured down ince&s;&s;antly. Tears are infectious. Two or three trick|led down from the poor man's eye. "May
<PB N="49" REF="035759_0048_10066882AD22FA38">God ble&s;s you! (&s;aid he) you have &s;hed the fir&s;t tears that have been &s;hed for me the&s;e ten years. The fountain of my &s;orrows is almo&s;t exhau&s;ted, but I have &s;till a drop to mix with your's." "Poor&mdash;poor man! (returned Julia) what &s;hall I do to &s;erve you?"&mdash;" O nothing! (he replied) nothing!&mdash;One of my children is dead, and the other will be &s;o in half an hour&mdash;I am waiting for its death, and I &s;hall then follow it."&mdash;"Alas! (&s;aid Julia &s;itting upon the bed&s;ide) would not you have it live? Is it impo&s;&s;ible to recover it?" He an&s;wered, "I hope it is." She then attempted to take hold of if; but he pre&s;&s;ed it clo&s;er to his &s;ide, and would not let it go. "I pity you, (&s;aid Julia) and wi&s;h to relieve you: you and your child may &s;till live. Suffer me to be your friend." At this he only &s;hook his head, and attempted to &s;mile, as if to tell her it was impo&s;&s;ible. How|ever, not to be guided longer by a man who was in de&s;pair, &s;he was re&s;olved to admini&s;ter to the woes of the wretched. Sue left the room, and returned to the
<PB N="50" REF="035759_0049_100668843A813BE0">watchman's wife. She &s;lightly men|tioned to her where &s;he had been, told her there was great di&s;tre&s;s, and begged of her to go out for a little wine, to be warmed for the u&s;e of the &s;ick. The woman (who was not de&s;titute of much good nature, though it was &s;trongly &s;ea&s;oned with that vice &s;o peculiar to good natured people, indifference) read|ily obeyed. The wine which &s;he brought was warmed, and carried in by Julia herfelf to the &s;olitary father. She in&s;i&s;ted that her landlady &s;hould not ac|company her; from an opinion, per|haps, that this &s;cene of &s;orrows was too &s;acred for the profane eye of the vul|gar.</P>
<P>The man of de&s;pair, (naturally enough, in his &s;ituation) refu&s;ed relief; but Julia in&s;i&s;ted on the thing, and &s;he had &s;hed too many tears to be refu&s;ed. He de&s;ired, however, that &s;ince they <HI>mu&s;t</HI> be relieved, the child &s;hould be re|lieved fir&s;t. "As for you (&s;aid he, withdrawing his arm from the child, which Julia was taking hold of, and
<PB N="51" REF="035759_0050_100668882B859618">turning to the one that was dead) as to you, my dear and lamented girl&mdash;my la&s;t and my be&s;t beloved&mdash;you have clo&s;ed your eye upon me, and you are &s;miling at life in the bo&s;om of your mother. You were weary of hearing your father's groans. You fled to invite him to follow." He now ki&s;&s;ed it, gazed upon it, hugged it, and wept upon it; and then dried the tears off its face, as if it could be con&s;cious of the favour.</P>
<P>In the mean time Julia was very bu&s;y about <HI>her</HI> child, but her a&s;&s;iduities were almo&s;t baffled. The child had opened its eyes, but it refu&s;ed to open its mouth. In &s;hort, &s;he was obliged to call to her a&s;&s;i&s;tance her ho&s;te&s;s, who readily came, and between them they poured down &s;ome warm wine mixed with water in its throat. Still it was in&s;en&s;ible; and at length it was thought prudent to carry it to the next room, to be nur&s;ed be|fore the fire; which the ho&s;te&s;s did.</P>
<P>Julia now admini&s;tered to the father, and he was revived. The balmy &s;trength of the wine recalled his expir|ing
<PB N="52" REF="035759_0051_10066889B0385088">&s;pirits, and warmed a heart which was almo&s;t cold. The fir&s;t u&s;e he made of his new acquired &s;trength was to thank his benefactre&s;s, and to enquire for his child. Being informed where it was, he &s;eemed to be &s;atisfied. Julia &s;oon after prepared for him a bit of bread, thin and toa&s;ted, which he ate with &s;ome difficulty. This, however, paved the way for his recovery; and in about two hours he was tolerably ea&s;y and &s;trong. The child in the oth|er room made a &s;lower progre&s;s back to life, but they did not de&s;pair.</P>
<P>This child (a boy) having been put to bed again, the watchman's wife re&s;um|ed her u&s;ual occupations; while Julia, who&s;e gentle faculties were &s;till attuned to &s;oftne&s;s and di&s;tre&s;s, waited upon the father, and pre&s;&s;ed him warmly to re|veal the origin and progre&s;s of his mis|fortunes. He &s;hook his head at this re|que&s;t; and told her it would be a hard ta&s;k; be&s;ides that, &s;he had already &s;hed tears enough that day upon his account. However, he complied: and Julia,
<PB N="53" REF="035759_0052_1006688B57F91D90">&s;itting upon his bed &s;ide, her cheek leaning upon her left hand, li&s;tened to a tale of deep and de&s;perate di&s;tre&s;s. "Behold before you (&s;aid he,) &s;tarved with hunger and covered with rags, a man who has long fought for his King, and &s;pilt for him his deare&s;t blood&mdash; who&s;e body is covered with wounds, in defence of that country which now leaves him as you &s;ee him! Such is the balm they have applied to my wounds!" &mdash;Though his notes were querulous, they were eloquent. But truth is always eloquent.&mdash;At pre&s;ent I am neither in lei&s;ure nor in the humour to repeat them; and perhaps I never &s;hall.</P>
<P>When he fini&s;hed his melancholy tale, he caught hold of the hand of Julia, and pre&s;&s;ed it to his bo&s;om.&mdash;"This bo&s;om was once warm (&s;aid he): but though it is cold, you are welcome in it. I cannot thank you; but my boy will live and do it, when I am crumbling in that grave from which you have drawn me for a moment." Julia, with that true politene&s;s which is natural to virtu|ous
<PB N="54" REF="035759_0053_1006688CE5CB6E28">minds, begged him to accept &s;ome money for his pre&s;ent nece&s;&s;ities, and promi&s;ed to vi&s;it him till it could be no longer in her power</P>
<P>It was now rather more than dinner time, but neither Dick nor Joe appear|ed. Julia was growing unea&s;y. Four o'clock &s;truck, out brought no comfort with it. It was five&mdash;but nobody ar|rived &mdash;Six&mdash;&s;even&mdash;eight&mdash;nobody! During the&s;e intervals &s;he had paid fre|quent 02 vi&s;its to the man in di&s;tre&s;s, and applied every lenitive &s;he could invent to his affliction; and &s;he charged her ho&s;te&s;s with great &s;incerity, at whatever time &s;he went away, to be attentive to his nece&s;&s;ities 'till her return, which would be hoth certain and quick. So he was for the pre&s;ent pretty well pro|vided for.</P>
<P>I have &s;aid it was now eight o'clock, and nobody appeared. She became very, very unea&s;y. It was now half pa&s;t eight. "Still nobody!&mdash;Good Heav|en! are my misfortunes never to end?" &mdash;it &s;eems <HI>not,</HI> Julia: for about a quar|ter
<PB N="55" REF="035759_0054_10066890DC783D10">before nine two of Sir John Fielding's men entered with Dick&mdash;drunk, very drunk&mdash;at their head.</P>
<P>Ah! it is as I always thought it&mdash; This dirty world has but few good per|&s;ons in it, and the&s;e few it is continually harra&s;&s;ing and pe&s;tering with its evils&mdash; nor does it often cea&s;e till it breaks their hearts. Shame on it, that an in|nocent beautiful Curate's daughter, who never prayed for the good things of this world, nor for the evil upon its inhabi|tants, &s;hould not be &s;uffered to <HI>go upon an errand</HI> for her father without mole&s;ta|tions and misfortunes! I repeat it&mdash; Shame upon &s;o dirty a world!</P>
<P>Now, gentle reader, whatever your thoughts upon this affair may be, cer|tain it is that Sir John Fielding's men are come in que&s;t of Julia; and (as one of our great Poets &s;ays in one of his <HI>Tragedies,</HI> which, however, he &s;tyles a <HI>Comedy</HI>) I'll lay you plums to pippins that you cannot conjecture their bu&s;ine&s;s with her.</P>
<P>To under&s;tand it, then, your men|ory
<PB N="56" REF="035759_0055_10066892610B8C88">mu&s;t recur to the adventures of Julia with the highwayman. He had met her in the bagnio, and given her a pur&s;e with money in it, and in their de|parture together from thence the high|wayman was apprehended. Julia fled, and was afterwards by chance conduct|ed to the round hou&s;e&mdash;as we have be|fore related at large. Now the high|wayman was apprehended upon the in|formation of the courageous Officer of the Guards, of who&s;e heroic and military virtues we have already &s;poken &s;o loudly. Ju&s;t when this coxcomb arrived at the office, the fat woman of Holborn had alighted there upon the &s;ame bu&s;ine&s;s. When the highwayman therefore was apprehended, the fir&s;t bu&s;ine&s;s thought nece&s;&s;ary was to &s;earch him, and all the different pur&s;es of the company were found upon him, except that of the fat woman. It was agreed that he could not have &s;pent it in &s;o &s;hort a time: <HI>ergo,</HI> he mu&s;t have given it away. To cor|roborate the &s;u&s;picion, the men recol|lected that a woman was along with
<PB N="57" REF="035759_0056_1006689429BAF3F0">him when he was apprehended, and the coxcomb Officer confirmed it. The ca&s;e was therefore plain: Julia mu&s;t have the pur&s;e in her po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. Away they &s;ally, with the Officer at their head, through &s;treets, bagnios, taverns, and night hou&s;es: but in vain: &s;he was no where to be found. The next night, be|tween eight and nine, one of them met Dick the watchman. (Dick was at this time returning home to Julia without any an&s;wer or information; for in&s;tead of going on her errand, he went to get drunk with her money.) The thief taker inquired of him by chance, as the adventure happened within his cir|cuit, if he had &s;een &s;uch a lady&mdash;after de&s;cribing her very minutely. "Seen her (&s;ays Dick)! why, &s;he is at my hou&s;e." This information was &s;uffi|cient for the &s;ervant of Ju&s;tice: he took Dick by the arm, and &s;ummoning one of his companions, &s;et off for the lodg|ing of Julia.</P>
<P>We have already &s;een them introduc|ed where &s;he was. They &s;eized her
<PB N="58" REF="035759_0057_10066895B75FA8C0">without ceremony, and proceeded, as u&s;ual to &s;earch her. The fatal pur&s;e, &s;o remarkable for the golden ta&s;&s;el at either end, was in a moment found.&mdash;This confirmed the &s;u&s;picion, and &s;he was carried away as an accomplice.&mdash;When will per&s;ecution cea&s;e to follow Virtue?</P>
<P>Sir John was not that night at home, and they informed her that &s;he mu&s;t be impri&s;oned till morning. <HI>Impri&s;oned!</HI> She &s;hrieked at the very &s;ound&mdash;"P&s;haw! (&s;aid one of them, &s;eeing her confu&s;ion) you need not be terrified, I a&s;&s;ure you, Ma'am: we are not going to a common pri&s;on. I have a pretty, little, &s;nug hou&s;e, and as clo&s;e as a cage, where you may &s;leep as &s;afely and &s;oundly as in your own bed chamber. No difference in the world, I a&s;&s;ure you, Ma'am&mdash;only that every door and win|dow in the hou&s;e is inclo&s;ed with &s;trong and triple iron bars. That's all, I a&s;&s;ure you, Ma'am: and notwith&s;tanding all the&s;e advantages, it will co&s;t you only a <HI>guinea</HI> for your bed&mdash;not a farthing
<PB N="59" REF="035759_0058_100668988768A6F8">more, I a&s;&s;ure you, Ma'am. I keeps the be&s;t u&s;age, the be&s;t <HI>tendance,</HI> and the be&s;t wines in the garden, I a&s;&s;ure you, Ma'am!&mdash;Lord, Ma'am then, what do you pout at? no cau&s;e to be terrified, I a&s;&s;ure you, Ma'am!"</P>
<P>Eloquent as this language was, and comfortable, it did not greatly gladden the heart of Julia. But there was no choice in the ca&s;e, and &s;he followed her guides. Arrived, they led her into an upper apartment, where there was a fire, and good furniture. She was left alone for ten minutes; at the end of which the landlord waited upon her, and a&s;ked what &s;he cho&s;e for &s;upper. "Noth|ing"&mdash;What did &s;he choo&s;e to drink, then? "nothing." (Oho, replied he) an' if &s;o be that you are &s;o ru&s;ty, good night to you with all my heart." He then turned upon his heels; and pulling the door after him with fury, locked it with a key which grated as it turned, amid&s;t the rattling of chains and the clanking of iron bars.</P>
<P>Dreadful &s;ounds to &s;uch an ear as
<PB N="60" REF="035759_0059_1006689B4352A1B8">Julia's! Her teeth gritted, and her joints trembled. This was the &s;evere&s;t &s;troke of all. To be impri&s;oned! and as an accomplice of a highwayman too! "But &s;he &s;ubmitted to Heaven, where all her wi&s;hes re&s;ted: her hopes leaned upon that, and upon the prayers of her father."</P>
<P>She retired to bed, but could not &s;leep; her misfortunes &s;till interrupted, and occupied her whole &s;oul. She tried again, but in vain: and to this purpo&s;e &s;he recollected the lines of her favourite Young. Sleep, &s;ays he,</P>
<Q><L>&mdash; Like the world, his ready vi&s;it pays</L>
<L>Where fortune &s;miles: the wretched he for|&s;akes;</L>
<L>Swift on his downy pinions flies from woe,</L>
<L>And lights on lids un&s;ullied with a tear.</L></Q>
<P>Her mind recurred to the &s;cenes that were pa&s;t, and reluctantly brooded over the gloomy a&s;&s;emblage. And in truth, when we reflect upon it, her ca&s;e was rather hard. It was now only the third night &s;ince &s;he had quitted the peaceful man&s;ion hou&s;e of Elmwood, and the
<PB N="61" REF="035759_0060_1006689D0FB68D70">arms of her father.&mdash;The fir&s;t night &s;he was &s;omewhere upon the road; the &s;econd &s;he was in a bagnio, and in a round hou&s;e, and in a garret; and the third &s;he was in pri&s;on. Each of the&s;e misfortunes was a mountain upon her mind, under which it &s;truggled; but by the &s;truggle it only became more feeble.</P>
<P>At length the &s;oul by its powerful and violent workings, overcame the body. Wearied with affliction, her &s;pirits langui&s;hed, and nature &s;unk into &s;lumber. Sleep of this kind, though not always the mo&s;t placid, is the heav|ie&s;t. She &s;lept till eight in the morn|ing, when &s;he aro&s;e. At nine they paid her a vi&s;it, and &s;he ate &s;ome breakfa&s;t; and at ten &s;he was carried, with a beat|ing heart, in a coach to Bow &s;treet.</P>
<P>Here &s;he did not wait long for the appearance of the Ju&s;tice, for every thing was prepared; even the unhappy highwayman was in waiting, as nece&s;|&s;ary to the examination. Indeed, it was thought mo&s;t proper to begin with que&s;tioning him apart upon the &s;ubject,
<PB N="62" REF="035759_0061_1006689E927A7BE8">and then with examining Julia; and by the compari&s;on of their re&s;pective evidences the truth might be ea&s;ily di&s;|covered.</P>
<P>When the highwayman had been examined upon his own account, an ob&s;tinacy natural to men in his de&s;perate &s;ituation prevented him from giving any account of the pur&s;e which was mi&s;&s;ing. But now, when he was informed that Julia was really in cu&s;tody, that honour which was not yet entirely extingui&s;hed in his heart, was rou&s;ed for her &s;afety. He ingenuou&s;ly told Sir John the hi&s;to|ry of the pur&s;e, with even its mo&s;t minute circum&s;tances; that he had robbed her among&s;t the re&s;t! that he afterwards met her accidentally in the bagnio, and gave her the money only with a view of re&s;toring her own; that he had not been above ten minutes in her com|pany, and that &s;he was in every re&s;pect innocent of the crime with which &s;he was charged.</P>
<P>Julia was next examined, and her evidence mo&s;t exactly &s;quared with the
<PB N="63" REF="035759_0062_100668A28E946FE8">former. Ingenuous as u&s;ual, &s;he took up the &s;tory at Elmwood, and carried it forward to the &s;tory of the pur&s;e; and &s;he told her little tale with that truth and &s;implicity which can never be counter|feited. Yet frequent attempts are made to imitate the&s;e amiable virtues, and the Ju&s;tice was &s;en&s;ible of this: he had heard her mention that &s;he had letters for Lord C&mdash;, and he de&s;ired to &s;ee them. The&s;e &s;he in&s;tantly produced to vouch for her &s;incerity. She added too, that there was <HI>&s;omewhere</HI> in town a per|&s;on who could confirm her words beyond &s;u&s;picion; but alas! poor <HI>Joe!</HI> &s;he knew not where to find him. "<HI>Joe!</HI> (&s;aid one of the Ju&s;tice's men who &s;tood be|hind Julia)&mdash;what, is your name <HI>Julia,</HI> madam?" Yes (replied Julia)." The man immediately ran out, and brought back in his hand the <HI>Daily Adverti&s;er,</HI> in which he read the following adver|ti&s;ement.</P>
<P>"If a &s;arten yung Lady, Mi&s;s Jullia&mdash;(who&s;e name is nothing to nobody, and which I doan't mention here, becau&s;e I
<PB N="64" REF="035759_0063_100668A4121E6D80">doa'nt think it proper)&mdash;&s;ees this, this is to let you kno, Mi&s;s Jullia, that Joe du&s;n't kno where you be, and that you du&s;n't kno where Joe is, for he is to be found at the &s;ine of the Swain with too Necks in Lad Lane, and no where el&s;e, as wit|ne&s;s my hand by me. <HI>JOE&mdash;,"</HI></P>
<P>This very extraordinary adverti&s;e|ment is copied <HI>verbatim et literatim</HI> from the real paper, which I have now in my po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. Julia li&s;tened to it with attention, and confe&s;&s;ed her feel|ings in her eyes, which gli&s;tened with expectation. Not contented with an aural information, &s;he &s;natched the pa|per, and devoured the precious mor&s;el with her own eyes. In &s;hort the &s;implic|ity of the thing &s;poke for it&s;elf, and Joe it was mo&s;t undoubtedly.</P>
<P>But it may be nece&s;&s;ary to explain this affair. I again &s;ummon the mem|ory of my readers back to that time of our hi&s;tory, when Joe and Julia un|luckily parted in Holborn. Joe did not look for her till the coach &s;topt in
<PB N="65" REF="035759_0064_100668A5D9C2D940">the Inn yard, and then he waited at the door of it for her appearance. He thought her long in coming, but his patience was not exhau&s;ted. The re&s;t of the company had been out of the coach &s;ome minutes. At length he ventured to thru&s;t in his head&mdash;but &s;he was not there! He &s;tarted back on his heel, and gazed wildly round the yard, but in vain. Oppo&s;ite to him he &s;aw the door of a public room open, and he ru&s;hed in without ceremony: from thence he &s;allied into the kitchen, &s;trode into the parlour, threw his eye into the bar, and peeped into the larder. Wounds! he looks furious, and he is almo&s;t breathle&s;s! He marched into the &s;tables, and in &s;hort into every place where he &s;aw a door open to receive him&mdash;but all would not do: &s;he was not to be found. He returned to the coach, took one peep more into it, but all was &s;olitary! "God ble&s;s my heart (&s;aid Joe to him&s;elf fidgetting, and &s;cratching among his auburn hair) pro|tect and &s;ave me from all temptations
<PB N="66" REF="035759_0065_100668A761616CE8">and evil &s;pirits! I wi&s;h I could &s;ee Mi&s;s Julia again." Now, at la&s;t, he be|thought him of what he ought to have done at fir&s;t, viz. to que&s;tion the coach|man concerning the affair, and the coachman informed him of the whole truth. This information in no degree abated his anxiety. "Didn't &s;he leave no word with you for me?" (&s;aid he to the coachman.) No.&mdash;"Don't you know where &s;he went?"&mdash;No.&mdash;"Don't you think &s;he'll come here this night?"&mdash;I can't tell you upon my word&mdash;Joe with downca&s;t looks and folded arms mea&s;ured the &s;pace acro&s;s the yard with long and melancholy &s;trides. He walk|ed into the pa&s;&s;age of the hou&s;e, and marked the clock. He counted the hours, as they rolled &s;low and heavy, but he &s;aw not his mi&s;tre&s;s. It was now ten o'clock, but no Julia came.&mdash;Alas! alas!</P>
<P>They are not the &s;evere&s;t, but they are the mo&s;t anxious moments the mind knows, when the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of it, &s;imple, timid, and hone&s;t, feels him&s;elf far
<PB N="67" REF="035759_0066_100668AB809BD688">from home, and for&s;aken in the mid&s;t of &s;trangers. The&s;e moments Joe now felt in all their bitterne&s;s. He went to bed without hope, and he aro&s;e in the morning in de&s;pair. He grieved in|ce&s;&s;antly, and he wi&s;hed for the bo&s;om of a friend to lean his griefs upon it. At length he di&s;clo&s;ed his mind to the ho&s;tler, and the ho&s;tler gave him his ad|vice. It was this: <HI>to adverti&s;e.</HI> Every body, he &s;aid, did it, upon every &s;ub|ject. "Always when he lo&s;t a <HI>hor&s;e,</HI> he adverti&s;ed for it; and why might not Joe do the &s;ame now for <HI>Julia?</HI> It would certainly lay open the whole af|fair, for adverti&s;ements could do any thing."</P>
<P>At this time Joe &s;tood too greatly in need of comfort, not to take any ad|vice that was offered to him. But he thought this advice excellent. He ac|cordingly wrote with great care the ad|verti&s;ement we have already repeated, and the ho&s;tler &s;ent one of his boys with him to the Daily Adverti&s;er.&mdash;And
<PB N="68" REF="035759_0067_100668AD060A8240">this is the hi&s;tory of this extraordinary adverti&s;ement.</P>
<P>When the Ju&s;tice found &s;o many cir|cum&s;tances &s;pontaneou&s;ly con&s;piring to vindicate her innocence, that her amia|ble &s;implicity &s;ubjected her to &s;o many dangers, and that &s;he was the object rather of a polite humanity than of per&s;ecution, he re&s;olved to intere&s;t him|&s;elf in her &s;afety. And in the fir&s;t place, he ordered one of his men to go and conduct Joe to his mi&s;tre&s;s. As to the fat woman, the Ju&s;tice told her that her money &s;hould be taken care of; and the highwayman was remanded to pri&s;on.</P>
<P>Joe arrives. I have not time to de|&s;cribe every thing; but my readers may be a&s;&s;ured that the meeting. between him and Julia was full affectionate. Suffice it to &s;ay, that Julia pre&s;&s;ed him warmly by the hand, and half cried with joy; and that Joe took fa&s;t hold of the &s;kirt of her robe, as if he dreaded her running away from him once more.</P>
<P>The friends thus met, the Ju&s;tice
<PB N="69" REF="035759_0068_100668AE8C8B6918">politely a&s;ked Julia how he could mo&s;t effectually &s;erve her? She replied, that her only bu&s;ine&s;s in town was to deliver her letters to Lord C&mdash;, and that if he would favour her with a guide thith|er, &s;he would always remember him with the mo&s;t unfeigned gratitude. This &s;he obtained; and, once more ac|knowledging her obligations to the Ju&s;|tice, they all &s;et off for Berkeley &s;quare.</P>
<P>Here they &s;oon arrived. The guide leaving them at the door. Joe imme|diately took off his hat, for he thought it high trea&s;on to be covered within &s;ix yards of a Lord's door: they knocked, but were told by the porter his Lord&s;hip was not at home. Julia &s;aid &s;he was &s;orry for that, becau&s;e &s;he had <HI>letters of importance</HI> for him. "I can't help that (an&s;wered the porter,) he's not at home; and he'll not be at home&mdash;I don't know when he'll be home."&mdash;But could not you gue&s;s Sir;&mdash;becau&s;e a <HI>great deal de|pends upon it.</HI>&mdash;"Lord, Ma'am (replied Cerberus)! I tell you I know nothing about it."&mdash;Sounds &s;o ungentle, utter|ed
<PB N="70" REF="035759_0069_100668B18ED63F90">by &s;o rude a voice, frightened Julia effectually, and &s;he ha&s;tened away from the door; and Joe, &s;orrowful enough, was preparing to follow&mdash;when the porter beckoned him back with a <HI>hem!</HI> and the motion of his finger. "Pray, my lad, (&s;aid this dog in office) who is that?</P>
<P>My mi&s;tre&s;s (an&s;wered Joe.)</P>
<P>"Ay&mdash;from the country, I &s;up|po&s;e?"</P>
<P>Yes (replied Joe): I come from the country too.</P>
<P>"O&mdash;&s;o I &s;ee&mdash;&s;o I &s;ee.&mdash;You are not acquainted, I find, with the <HI>ways</HI> in this town?"</P>
<P>No, Sir, (&s;aid Joe)&mdash;not with <HI>all</HI> of them.</P>
<P>Why, then&mdash;(come hither&mdash;your ear a moment) I have the honour to be Lord C&mdash;'s porter) and my ma&s;ter has or|dered me&mdash;that is, I and my ma&s;ter have agreed&mdash;to receive no letter here, unle&s;s the bearer gives me a crown.&mdash;However, as you and your mi&s;tre&s;s are &s;trangers, and I am a man of honour,
<PB N="71" REF="035759_0070_100668B44063CEC8">I'll be more merciful to you, and &s;o con&s;ent to take only half a crown&mdash;But mum&mdash;&s;ly&mdash;not a word for your life&mdash;for if my ma&s;ter was to hear I <HI>take &s;o little,</HI> he'd turn me out of my place.</P>
<P>Sure I am, ma&s;ter, (an&s;wered Joe) we are both very much obliged to you for being &s;o kind.&mdash;But then what can you do for us, if &s;o be that my Lord a'n't at home?</P>
<P>"P&s;haw, man! (&s;aid the porter) run after your mi&s;tre&s;s and bring the mo|ney, and I'll &s;atisfy you about that."</P>
<P>O&mdash;an' that be all (replied Joe) I can pay the money my&s;elf.</P>
<P>He drew out his la&s;t half crown, and gave it. He then ran after Julia, and as he went he murmured to him&s;elf&mdash;"Icod tho' wern't that a <HI>Lord's</HI> hou&s;e it looks hugely like bribery and corrup|tion."</P>
<P>Our two travellers now returned, and were received by the porter with a more gracious complai&s;ance. He now in|formed them that, tho' his Lord&s;hip was
<PB N="72" REF="035759_0071_100668B5C5E9A048">out of town, he was only at his villa, and would certainly return to town to dinner; but that if they were in a hurry, my young Lord was at home, and that he had leave to open his father's letters in his ab&s;ence. Julia delivered her pack|et to the porter, and they were or|dered to walk into the anti chamber. The letters were &s;ent up to the noble youth in his dre&s;&s;ing room.</P>
<P>Now in order to prepare my readers for a very important aera in the life of my heroine, it may be nece&s;&s;ary to re|late what this noble youth was. A fooli&s;h grandmother had le&s;t him three thou&s;and a year independent of his fa|ther, and of his age; all which, with three thou&s;and more, he gallantly &s;pent like a man of &s;pirit, long before the year was done. He u&s;ed to &s;ay, that every kingdom in Europe contributed to furni&s;h his &s;eraglio: he only meant by this, that he kept in pay one French, one Spani&s;h, one Italian, one Scandina|vian, one German, one Iri&s;h, and one Bri|ti&s;h nymph, all at one time; which he
<PB N="73" REF="035759_0072_100668B74BAA5BD0">actually did. He was deep in the &s;e|cret at Soho, very deep in the my&s;teries at Arthur's. He boa&s;ted&mdash;and he had a right to do it&mdash;that he had killed five waiters, and &s;hot two clergymen, and &s;even hundred &s;heep; which la&s;t feat he performed as follows. He was a fowler when at his father's e&s;tate in the country; and when he had been un&s;uc|ce&s;sful in pur&s;uit of game, he always di&s;charged his piece into the body of a &s;heep. As this amu&s;ement exactly hit his ta&s;te, he would &s;ometimes recharge, and redi&s;charge, till perhaps before his return home, he would leave half a dozen dead upon the field. He fre|quently ob&s;erved, that this was an a|mu&s;ement which ought to be practi&s;ed by all Noblemen, in order to fit them to <HI>command in the field</HI> in time of war, in the &s;ervice of their country.&mdash;He boa&s;t|ed too, that he had killed fifteen women by <HI>breaking their hearts</HI> with a hopele&s;s pa&s;&s;ion. This, however, was (to u&s;e an old and hone&s;t Engli&s;h phra&s;e) a <HI>lie:</HI> for he never killed but one woman, and
<PB N="74" REF="035759_0073_100668B9FB8050A8">that was by <HI>breaking</HI>&mdash;not her <HI>heart,</HI> but her <HI>neck,</HI> and then throwing her into the hor&s;e pond, where he &s;wore &s;he had drowned her&s;elf&mdash;But <HI>&s;he</HI> was only a dairy maid. He boa&s;ted al&s;o&mdash;But, in &s;hort, we are tired with repeating his glories. Suffice it to &s;ay, that he is at pre&s;ent the pink of the young Peerage, and the ornament of mother II&mdash;'s&mdash;and St. James.</P>
<P>Such was the youth to whom the let|ter of the father of Julia was carried. He opened it, and on reading the fol|lowing paragraph,</P>
<P><HI>"I have pre&s;umed, my Lord, to &s;end my</HI> Daughter <HI>as the bearer of this petition,"</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>On reading this, he rang his bell with great ha&s;te, and enquired if the <HI>bearer</HI> was below? Being informed that &s;he was, he flew down the &s;tairs, and, look|ing in Julia's face, with the mo&s;t polite courte&s;y be de&s;ired her to walk up &s;tairs while he con&s;idered of her letter. The &s;ervants were ordered at the &s;ame time to conduct Joe into the hall, and be
<PB N="75" REF="035759_0074_100668BCAC1DF200">civil to him. Julia a&s;cended after her noble patron.</P>
<P><HI>&mdash; Hic pauca defunt. We mu&s;t here pa&s;s ever the hi&s;tory of half an hour, becau&s;e it is not yet ripe for relation. &mdash;</HI></P>
<P>In the mean time Lord C&mdash;'s Chaplain, who had been with his Lord|&s;hip in the country, arrived at the hou&s;e. He came home before his Lord&s;hip, to fini&s;h &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s of im|portance to him&s;elf before dinner time. When he entered, he ob&s;erved Joe &s;taring about in the hall, and perceiving him to be a &s;tranger from the country, entered into conver&s;ation with him. He had not many que&s;tions to a&s;k, for Joe with his u&s;ual frankne&s;s told him the
<PB N="76" REF="035759_0075_100668BE2FCD0B98">whole hi&s;tory&mdash;about him&s;elf, about Julia, and Julia's bu&s;ine&s;s, and where &s;he was now, and with whom. Now this Chaplain was plain in his manners and equally plain in his dre&s;s&mdash;&s;o plain that he &s;carcely appeared to be <HI>of the cloth.</HI> Though an enemy to blood|&s;hed, he was far from being a coward; though a Churchman, he was no hypo|crite; and though he dete&s;ted &s;ub&s;crip|tion to the Thirty nine Articles, he was allowed to be a very hone&s;t man.</P>
<P>The Chaplain, having fini&s;hed his in|terview with Joe, was retiring to his own apartment. He had not opened his door, when a loud &s;hriek &s;aluted his ear&mdash;then another&mdash;and another. A thou&s;and ideas ru&s;hed upon his mind. He knew Julia by report, and he knew his young Lord by experience. There was no doubt of the bu&s;ine&s;s below. He ha&s;tened down the &s;tairs, and li&s;ten|ed a moment at the key hole. He could only perceive that &s;ome per&s;ons were engaged in a violent &s;truggle, and that the chairs were knocked again&s;t
<PB N="77" REF="035759_0076_100668BFD996B090">each other. He tried to enter, but the door was locked. Placing his &s;houlder again&s;t it, therefore, he forced it for|ward with gentlene&s;s and with ea&s;e. He entered; and lo!&mdash;Innocence was once more in di&s;tre&s;s!</P>
<P>The hair of Julia was di&s;hevelled, and a handkerchief was drawn clo&s;e over her mouth, which prevented her cries. Her cloak and handkerchief lay upon the floor, and the arms of her ra|vi&s;her were twined clo&s;ely around her. A &s;hoe had dropped from her foot, and many of the pins had quitted her bo&s;|om.&mdash;Unfortunate girl! doomed con|tinually to be the prey of cowards and &s;coundrels!</P>
<P>The noble youth quitted his hold when the Chaplain appeared, and, ad|vancing to him, exclaimed in a thtreat|ening tone, "How dare you, Sir, force your impertinence upom <HI>me</HI> in my own dre&s;&s;ing room?"</P>
<P>"My Lord&mdash;(returned the young man, putting his left hand in his bo&s;om, and giving him a full but indifferent
<PB N="78" REF="035759_0077_100668C28F92ADD8">look)&mdash;My Lord&mdash;does it &s;uit your high &s;pirit to be told, that you are the meane&s;t&mdash;O by far the meane&s;t creature in your father's hou&s;e? Noble, without worth&mdash;and proud, without dignity&mdash; you are beneath the pimp who caters for your appetites.&mdash;Poor, pitiful, wretched animal! I do not pull you by the no&s;e&mdash;I do not kick you on the breech&mdash;I do not la&s;h you round the room&mdash;I do not in any degree deign to cha&s;ti&s;e the wretch, who has &s;tooped to in&s;ult a woman.&mdash;Go, then, you boa&s;ter! retire into your clo&s;et, and blu&s;h in pri|vate; and remember that you have re|duced your&s;elf to be forced to hear the&s;e &s;tinging truths even from &s;o hum|ble a man as your father's Chaplain.&mdash;I &s;corn, Sir, to tell your father that you are a &s;coundrel; but do not forget that for the future I con&s;ider you as my in|ferior."</P>
<P>He fini&s;hed: and taking Julia by the hand, he led her out of the room, and drew the door behind him.</P>
<P>He conducted her into his own apart|ment,
<PB N="79" REF="035759_0078_100647710A8F4328">and &s;ympathized with her in that &s;train of humane politene&s;s which is ever in&s;eparable from undebauched minds. After &s;he had compo&s;ed her|&s;elf, he di&s;tantly enquired (as if he had not known) into her bu&s;ine&s;s. This was exactly a repetition of Joe's narration.</P>
<P>"I thank you, Madam, (&s;aid he) for your politene&s;s. You will &s;ee Lord C&mdash; in about an hour; but previ|oul&s;ly I think it my duty to inform you of what ought not to be longer conceal|ed from you&mdash;it is now one o'clock&mdash; Exactly at ten&mdash;about three hours ago&mdash;Lord C&mdash; appointed me to the Curacy you are come to &s;olicit. This information in no degree &s;tartled Julia, nor unruffled her features. She ob&s;erv|ed that &s;ince her father had not been lucky enough to obtain the Curacy, &s;he was happy the appointment was be|&s;towed upon a man who re&s;embled him &s;o much in his virtues.</P>
<P>At the time &s;pecified Lord C&mdash; arrived. Julia was introduced o him by the Chaplain, and he &s;ent to his &s;on
<PB N="80" REF="035759_0079_100668C6C5D76450">for her letters. On reading them he confirmed what the Chaplain had men|tioned.</P>
<P>He then turned to Julia, &s;aluted her with that virtuous freedom for which he was always remarkable, and fondly conver&s;ed with her about the moments he had &s;pent with her father about fifty years ago. He next in&s;i&s;ted that &s;he &s;hould &s;tay with him two or three days; to which &s;he with the utmo&s;t difficulty a&s;&s;ented, and of which &s;he informed her father by letter. When the young Lord heard that Julia was to continue her vi&s;it, he a&s;&s;umed &s;ome pretence for retiring to his father's villa till her de|parture.</P>
<P>Need I mention, that the Chaplain &s;elt the force of the eyes of Julia? Alack! from the moment he fir&s;t &s;aw her in tears, his heart was wounded to the core&mdash;for the tears of a woman are irre&s;i&s;table. Indeed the only good lines in one of our new tragedies are to this purpo&s;e:</P>
<PB N="81" REF="035759_0080_100668C84C7DF7B0">
<Q><L>&mdash;Un&s;kilful they</L>
<L>Who dre&s;s the Queen of Love in wanton Smiles:</L>
<L>Brighte&s;t &s;he &s;hines amid&s;t a &s;how'r of tears:</L>
<L>The graces that adorn her beauty mo&s;t</L>
<L>Are &s;oftne&s;s, &s;en&s;ibility, and pity.</L>
<BIBL>ALONZO.</BIBL></Q>
<P>Now with regard to this Chaplain&mdash; Julia, on her part&mdash;But I will not &s;ay any thing about it. Be it &s;uffcient to ob&s;erve, that from the moment a man evinces his courage and his honour, the heart of a virtuous woman is ready to receive him.</P>
<P><HI>&mdash;Hic multa de&s;unt. Here we mu&s;t leap over the hi&s;tory of three days, for</HI> Julia <HI>will have it &s;o.&mdash;</HI></P>
<P>On the morning of the fourth day, Julia and the Curate were preparing to &s;et off on their journey for the banks
<PB N="82" REF="035759_0081_100668CB1A750A70">of the Avon: &s;he to her father, and he to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his Curacy. Before their departure, he begged once more a word with her in private. He led her towards a very di&s;tant part of the hou&s;e, into an humble apartment po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed by one of the old family nur&s;es, who&s;e favourite he long had been. Now, though it may &s;eem &s;trange that he &s;hould lead her thither as a place of retirement, certain it is that it was by far the mo&s;t retired and &s;ecret &s;pot in the hou&s;e, for the old woman was completely deaf, and almo&s;t blind: A few more days would clo&s;e her eyes for|ever. In this humble man&s;ion, he &s;at at one &s;ide of a table, oppo&s;ite to Julia, and he told her he had one favour to beg. "Three days (&s;aid he,) my be|loved Julia, are pa&s;t, in which I told you the true tale of my heart You li&s;tened, it is true, but &s;o faintly li&s;tened, that my hopes are &s;carcely kept alive. Before we depart&mdash;before we enter up|on the bu&s;tle of a high road&mdash;deign to be&s;tow on me one mark, to give me
<PB N="83" REF="035759_0082_100668CDCD5B28B0">one a&s;&s;urance, that you do not dete&s;t me. Were it but&mdash;" The blu&s;hes and &s;miles of Julia interrupted him. She &s;tretched her hand to him acro&s;s the table, and he almo&s;t devoured it with ki&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, they &s;at off on their jour|ney, attended by the tru&s;ty Joe. Without any accident, they arrived in due time at Elmwood. The father, overpowered by love and tenderne&s;s, &s;unk at the &s;ide of his daughter. The daughter, agitated by affection and joy, filled the bo&s;om of her father with &s;ighs, and revived him with the plenty and warmth of her tears. The evening was &s;pent in the recital of her adventures: while Joe, in the centre of the green, had the whole village col|lected around him, and related to them the wonders of London.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t now clo&s;e this hi&s;tory. Sev|eral months have elap&s;ed &s;ince the a|bove events happened, and the young Curate is now happy in the warm bo&s;|om
<PB N="84" REF="035759_0083_100668CF50119A08">of his Julia. Julia too is ble&s;&s;ed, for the hou&s;es of her hu&s;band and of her father are adjoining to each other.</P>
