<HEAD>A FEW OBSERVATIONS, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Much Re&s;pected and Worthy Fellow Citizens of all the United States,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THOSE who call to mind the di&s;mal, gloomy &s;tate of de&s;pondency we were all in at the very time (and for a year or two before) our deputies were fram|ing our now con&s;titution; the then very &s;mall hopes, from a variety of &s;ymptoms, that when met, any would be fixed upon, &s;o as to be generally agree to; the very long and warm di&s;putes and oppo&s;ite opinions that hap|pened among&s;t them&s;elves upon that mo&s;t important oc|ca&s;ion; the turn, notwith&s;tanding, as it were <HI>all at once,</HI> of all the &s;tates pre&s;ent, <HI>unanimou&s;ly</HI> to con&s;ent to re|commend the federal form we have; that the &s;tates al&s;o &s;hould <HI>&s;eparately</HI> debate as warmly on the acceptance of this form; that at la&s;t all the &s;tates of the union &s;hould <HI>univer&s;ally</HI> adopt it; and <HI>above all,</HI> that this form &s;hould contain in it&s;elf, extracted from the democratical, the ari&s;tocratical, and the ab&s;olute &s;y&s;tems, whatever is worth having from each, clear of, and guarded from, all the &s;hocking and pernicious tendencies each of tho&s;e &s;y&s;tems are expo&s;ed to, and have at times been woefully felt by the &s;ubjects of either: I &s;ay, tho&s;e who weigh the&s;e occurrences alone, (many more as extraordinary might be adduced) and do not perceive a kind fo&s;tering hand of Providence leading the United States to the formation and <HI>univer&s;al</HI> adoption at la&s;t, of our therefore excel|lent, and let me add, almo&s;t miraculou&s;ly-made con&s;ti|tution, mu&s;t, I think, be looked upon, if po&s;&s;ible, as
<PB N="4" REF="032168_0003_0FF167AEB0BD62F0">great unbelievers as Mr. Paine &s;eems to make him&s;elf to be. And here let me notice, <HI>en pa&s;&s;ant,</HI> a clau&s;e in a letter of this Mr. Paine to our Pre&s;ident, dated at Paris <HI>but in July la&s;t,</HI> in which he &s;tyles him&s;elf an Anti-Con|&s;titutionali&s;t, not wi&s;hing to be called an Anti-Federali&s;t&mdash; <Q>It was only (&s;ays he) the ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity of &s;ome federal authority extending equally over all the &s;tates, that an in&s;trument &s;o incon&s;i&s;tent as the federal con|&s;titution is, obtained a &s;uffrage.</Q> By this, 'tis plain, he &s;eems to think our con&s;titution ought now to be kicked out, being <HI>in it&s;elf</HI> &s;o <HI>"incon&s;i&s;tent"</HI> and not worth "a &s;uffrage." Whatever may have been Mr. Paine's private thoughts, as he well knew what was brewed and brewing in July la&s;t in Paris again&s;t us, this pa&s;&s;age carries more the appearance of the malevolence of an in&s;idious enemy wi&s;hing to &s;tir up divi&s;ions among&s;t us to favour the views of France, than any glimp&s;e of the feeling, &s;ympa|thizing affection of a cordial citizen, <HI>what he affects &s;till to call him&s;elf.</HI></P>
<P>An idea of perfection &s;eems to be implanted in our nature, far beyond what the be&s;t man can attain to in prac|tice: our works are like our&s;elves; in the mo&s;t correct, imperfections may be &s;pied.</P>
<Q><L>"Whoever thinks a faultle&s;s piece to &s;ee,</L>
<L>"Thinks what ne'er was, nor is, nor e'er &s;hall be."</L>
<BIBL>POPE.</BIBL></Q>
<P>Some men of a &s;trange turn, fond of laying hold of the lea&s;t &s;lips, even in the be&s;t plans, to over&s;et them, &s;eem always for pulling down whatever may be propo&s;ed, without ever attempting, them&s;elves, to &s;ub&s;titute any thing in its place, however ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary that &s;omething &s;hould be done. Mr. Paine &s;eems to be one of the&s;e pull-down politicians. His Common Sen&s;e is a capital work of this ca&s;t, acknowledged to have been well-timed, and of very great &s;ervice to us all in our &s;truggle with Great-Britain; but, &s;till, not &s;o nece&s;&s;ary by any means, that we &s;hould not have &s;ucceeded <HI>with|out it:</HI> however, for this we were much obliged to his
<PB N="5" REF="032168_0004_0FF167B05DE4B5C0">pull-down qualities. But has he not now entirely can|celled all this obligation, by endeavouring to pull down our con&s;titution, and by that means throw us back again into the &s;ame gloomy, de&s;ponding &s;tate we were in before it exi&s;ted? Happy for us, he was not here to be con|cerned in the <HI>building</HI> it, his talents not laying that way. <HI>Pulling down</HI> is his forte; <HI>here,</HI> in my opinion, while he kept to <HI>quid valeant humeri,</HI> his true <HI>political</HI> line, none exceeded him: but his Age of Rea&s;on has run his bark bump a&s;hore, and made him appear in as odd a charac|ter there, as the bear in the boat, turned &s;ailor.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s I &s;hould be glad to &s;ee &s;omething <HI>built up</HI> by a man &s;o long employed only in <HI>pulling down:</HI> it mu&s;t, I think, be a curio&s;ity indeed: any &s;trong arm, with (I had almo&s;t &s;aid <HI>without</HI>) <HI>any</HI> head, may be &s;uf|ficient to pull down a fine building; but, to erect a tol|erably convenient one, that may be indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;|&s;ary, in its room, a nice hand, guided by a head furni&s;hed with many data in the <HI>building way,</HI> that Mr. Paine has never hitherto appeared po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of, &s;eems not to be di&s;pen&s;ed with.</P>
<P>Hitherto, in Mr. Paine's various political works of pulling down, he has offered rea&s;ons; but his bare <HI>ip&s;e dixit</HI> he &s;eems to think &s;ufficient to make us a&s;hamed of our con&s;titution. But my worthy fellow citizens, under this <HI>"&s;o incon&s;i&s;tent"</HI> a con&s;titution, not worth "a &s;uf|frage," according to Mr. Paine, we have been more hap|py and flouri&s;hing &s;ince its exi&s;tence, now eight years, than any of the be&s;t and mo&s;t tranquil powers in Europe have been for ten times as long. Let us, therefore, be thankful for it; and <HI>&s;uch as it is,</HI> a work made by men, not by angels, be contented with it, and join &s;houlder to &s;houlder in its &s;upport: not doubting that the &s;ame over-ruling Providence that has favoured us under it hitherto, will not fail us in future, if we do not fail our&s;elves.</P>
<P>The clo&s;er, my friends, you keep to this our heaven-be&s;towed con&s;titution, (for, let Mr. Paine think what he
<PB N="6" REF="032168_0005_0FF167B234E9CAA8">will, I confe&s;s I think it &s;o) and the more you watch over it, the better and &s;afer &s;ituation will you and your po&s;terity find your&s;elves in.</P>
<Q><L>"Still <HI>with it&s;elf compar'd,</HI> its text peru&s;e,</L>
<L>"And let your comment be&mdash;</L></Q>
<P>The farewell legacy of our long tried, true and tru&s;ty friend Pre&s;ident Wa&s;hington. For, be per&s;uaded, you will find his fatherly recommendation as good a comment to our con&s;titution, as "The Mantuan Mu&s;e," &s;o much recommended by Pope, can be to old Homer.</P>
<P>This intru&s;ion, my friends, on your patience, is oc|ca&s;ioned by three late public occurrences appearing to me much to affect our con&s;titution, and, if not properly and timely noticed, their con&s;equences may be very di&s;|tre&s;&s;ing, if not fatal. That I might not appear a party man, I kept de&s;ignedly &s;ilent till all our elections were over.</P>
<P>They are, fir&s;t, an a&s;&s;ertion in the la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion of con|gre&s;s, very pertinaciou&s;ly maintained by a number of members, that congre&s;s had no right "to enquire into the merits of a foreign treaty."</P>
<P N="2">2dly. The manner our la&s;t election for a chief magi&s;|trate has been carried on.</P>
<P N="3">3dly. The attempt of a foreign mini&s;ter to appeal to the people at large.</P>
<P>With regard to the fir&s;t of the&s;e, it will be fully &s;uf|ficient, in my opinion, to <HI>contra&s;t</HI> the power given by the con&s;titution to the pre&s;ident and &s;enate united, with the general power, given by the &s;ame con&s;titution, to the congre&s;s, (of which the repre&s;entatives are a part) to &s;ee, not only the danger, but the weak foundation of that a&s;&s;ertion. However, a few remarks &s;hall be added.</P>
<Q><P>The pre&s;ident &s;hall have power, by and with the con&s;ent of the &s;enate, to make treaties; provid|ed 2-3ds of the &s;enate pre&s;ent concur.</P></Q>
<Q><P>The congre&s;s &s;hall have power to provide for the general welfare of the United States.</P></Q>
<P><PB N="7" REF="032168_0006_0FF167B6361F06B8">
Nothing appears to me ea&s;ier than that each of the&s;e powers may do the duty enjoined, without cla&s;hing or interfering in the lea&s;t with each other. Let the pre&s;ident and &s;enate <HI>make</HI> a treaty <HI>as directed,</HI> without the congre&s;s interfering. Let the congre&s;s, when a treaty <HI>is made,</HI> provide for it, if they think it not contrary to the welfare of the United States. Here we find the congre&s;s have nothing to do with the <HI>making</HI> of a treaty, (and very rightly, from the delay and variety of ob&s;tructions that would probably happen in &s;o numerous a body) but, <HI>when made</HI> by the pre&s;ident and &s;enate, and application is had to them to provide for it, can any per&s;on <HI>then</HI> think his bu&s;ine&s;s <HI>excluded entirely</HI> from the direction given them, "to provide for the general welfare of the United States;" but that they are <HI>&s;till obliged</HI> to make &s;uch provi&s;ion, even if they are per&s;uaded that it is ex|tremely dangerous to, if not de&s;tructive of <HI>that general welfare?</HI></P>
<P>Many good rea&s;ons may be given for their not being concerned in the <HI>making</HI> of a treaty; but not one, I imagine, that <HI>when made,</HI> at all events, whether they think it for, or not, for the general welfare of the United States, they ought &s;till to provide for it. This appears to me &s;o plain a ca&s;e, that there does not &s;eem occa&s;ion to call in the &s;pirit of our con&s;titution as an arbitrator; but yet let us call it in, in &s;ettling this point, allowed to be of the <HI>utmo&s;t importance.</HI> We are all made to be|lieve that the three departments of our government, are mutual checks on each other, and that in tho&s;e checks lies our great &s;ecurity. This is what I call <HI>the &s;pirit</HI> of our con&s;titution, and accordingly, even in this bu&s;ine&s;s of treaty-making, the &s;enate is a check on the pre&s;ident. But where is the check upon the pre&s;ident and &s;enate <HI>united,</HI> &s;hould they combine and act treacherou&s;ly, if this <HI>new</HI> doctrine &s;hould take place? Is there no danger here? No need for any <HI>father</HI> check? A treaty, <HI>when made,</HI> is a <HI>&s;upreme</HI> law of the land. Some trading na|tions would very probably, to bring about a treaty to
<PB N="8" REF="032168_0007_0FF167BA1F8D1660">their liking with the United States, give very large dou|ceurs. I hope our pre&s;ident and &s;enate will always be an uncorruptible body; but hi&s;tory tells us that con&s;uls and &s;enates have had clammy fingers: what has been, may be again. Thank heaven, our con&s;titution does not de|&s;ert us even here. We mu&s;t be <HI>all</HI> rogues, <HI>all</HI> rotten, before we can be ruined: when that indeed is the ca&s;e, there is no help for us; the body politic, like the natural body, mu&s;t be &s;oon after entirely di&s;&s;olved. They are both pa&s;t cure.</P>
<P>Here let me declare my concern, that the congre&s;s &s;ent for the papers relative to <HI>the making</HI> of the Briti&s;h treaty. This &s;tep appears to me to have been <HI>unnece&s;&s;ary,</HI> as the treaty it&s;elf was before them, a &s;ufficient ground to form their judgment upon. But the a&s;toni&s;hment to hear it a&s;&s;erted, that they had no right to enquire into its merits, mu&s;t have irritated many. Heat begets heat; and one part over&s;tretching one way, often fires the other to do the like their way. This is human nature collectively, as well as individually.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s my&s;elf one, though no favourer of the Bri|ti&s;h treaty while pending, made very happy, at hearing that &s;o many members, who had expre&s;&s;ed them&s;elves again&s;t it in the hou&s;e, had &s;acrificed their private opinions to the peace of the public. But, indeed, I never at any time thought that treaty of &s;uch moment, that it &s;hould be refu&s;ed to be provided for by our repre&s;ent|atives.</P>
<P>Farther, what is here &s;aid, is intended to prove the con&s;titutional right the congre&s;s have to con&s;ider the merits of a treaty; not by any means to in&s;inuate, that upon every bad bargain, they &s;hould deny to provide for a treaty. No! But upon the mo&s;t glaring, trying oc|ca&s;ions, like the Briti&s;h parliament <HI>(fas e&s;t et ab ho&s;te doceri)</HI> to exerci&s;e that right: this cau&s;es no interruption among&s;t them in making their treaties with foreign na|tions, who know they claim &s;uch a right, and will exer|ci&s;e it when they find it ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary. What
<PB N="9" REF="032168_0008_0FF167BBC4933420">rea&s;onable objection can they then have to our doing it only on &s;uch occa&s;ions?</P>
<P>I am aware that foreign nations, as well as bad pre|&s;idents and &s;enates, would wi&s;h to &s;ee no po&s;&s;ibility of any <HI>after</HI> reckoning; but that the repre&s;entatives of the people &s;hould be obliged to provide for any treaty laid before them, whatever may be its merits, duration or tendency. But our con&s;titution provides an ample re|medy in &s;uch ca&s;es, if the people but do their parts. Send hone&s;t, firm men, of good &s;ound common &s;en&s;e, that can judge when it will be ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to apply that remedy; when not.</P>
<P>Still pardon me, my worthy friends, for thinking the manner of carrying on the la&s;t election for our chief magi&s;trate, very objectionable, and, if continued, &s;eems in its tendency, not only calculated to foment and keep up heats and animo&s;ities among&s;t us, but in no long time, I am afraid, to over&s;et our union, or &s;plit and &s;hiver us into many different governments; and if we once begin to divide, no one can fore&s;ee the end of it.</P>
<P>Our con&s;titution &s;ays, <Q>Each &s;tate &s;hall appoint, in &s;uch manner as the legi&s;lature thereof may direct, a number of electors, equal to the whole number of &s;enators and repre&s;entatives to which the &s;tate may be entitled in the congre&s;s: <HI>but no &s;enator, or repre&s;ent|ative, or per&s;on holding an office of tru&s;t or profit under the United States, &s;hall be appointed an elector.</HI></Q></P>
<Q><P>The electors <HI>&s;hall</HI> meet in their re&s;pective &s;tates, and <HI>[&s;hall]</HI> vote by ballot for <HI>two per&s;ons,</HI> one of whom, at lea&s;t, &s;hall not be an inhabitant of the &s;ame &s;tate with them&s;elves; and they &s;hall make a li&s;t of all the per&s;ons voted for, and of the number of votes for each; which li&s;t they &s;hall &s;ign and certify, and tran&s;mit, &s;ealed, to the &s;eat of the government of the United States, directed to the pre&s;ident of the &s;enate. The pre&s;ident of the &s;enate &s;hall, in the pre|&s;ence of the &s;enate and hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives, open all the certificates, and the votes &s;hall then be
<PB N="10" REF="032168_0009_0FF167BE9C3FE348">counted. The per&s;on having the greate&s;t number of votes &s;hall be the pre&s;ident, if &s;uch number be a ma|jority of the whole number of electors appointed; and if there be more than one who have &s;uch ma|jority, and have an equal number of votes, then the hou&s;e of repre&s;entatives &s;hall immediately chu&s;e, by ballot, one of them for pre&s;ident; and if no per&s;on have a majority, <HI>then, from the five highe&s;t on the li&s;t,</HI> the &s;aid hou&s;e &s;hall, in like manner, chu&s;e the pre&s;i|dent. But in chu&s;ing the pre&s;ident, the votes &s;hall be taken by &s;tates, the repre&s;entatives from each &s;tate having one vote; a quorum for this purpo&s;e &s;hall con|&s;i&s;t of a member or members from two-thirds of the &s;tates: and a majority of all the &s;tates &s;hall be nece&s;|&s;ary to a choice. In every ca&s;e, after the choice of the pre&s;ident, the per&s;on having the greate&s;t number of votes of the electors, &s;hall be the vice-pre&s;ident; but if there &s;hould remain two or more, who have equal votes, the &s;enate &s;hall chu&s;e from them, by ballot, the vice-pre&s;ident.</P>
<P>The congre&s;s may determine the time of chu&s;ing the electors, and the day on which they &s;hall give their votes; which day &s;hall be THE SAME throughout the United States.</P>
<P>No per&s;on, except a natural born citizen, or a citi|zen of the United States at the time of the adoption of this con&s;titution, &s;hall be eligible to the office of pre&s;ident; neither &s;hall any per&s;on be eligible to that office, who &s;hall not have attained the age of thirty-five years, and been fourteen years a re&s;ident within the United States.</P></Q>
<P>Now, my fellow citizens, &s;uppo&s;e we read the latter part of the fir&s;t of the&s;e clau&s;es, thus: <Q>But NO PER|SON holding an office of tru&s;t or profit under the United States, &s;hall be appointed an elector.</Q> Do not the words, "no per&s;on," <HI>in them&s;elves,</HI> as com|pleatly include the &s;enator and repre&s;entative, without their being particularly named, as with? Therefore, un|le&s;s
<PB N="11" REF="032168_0010_0FF167C4F6657210">the&s;e words, <HI>"&s;enator or repre&s;entative,"</HI> are taken di&s;tinctly and &s;eparately, as the characteri&s;tic of a legi&s;|lative capacity, they are altogether nugatory and &s;uper|fluous. Whoever attends to the &s;tyle of the con&s;titu|tion, will, I believe, find no where el&s;e in it, &s;uch an <HI>unnecessary</HI> redundancy. Therefore, as it appears to me, &s;enator and repre&s;entative being to be under&s;tood in the legi&s;lative character of each, and ONLY &s;o, they are both excluded, by the intention of the con&s;titution it&s;elf, from being electors; for, had it been de&s;igned that any a&s;&s;embly &s;hould have appointed the electors from among them&s;elves, preci&s;ion required that the words <HI>from among them&s;elves,</HI> or others of like &s;ignification, &s;hould have been in&s;erted: as no &s;uch are, when they &s;eem &s;o nece&s;|&s;ary, no claim, e&s;pecially one of &s;uch moment, ought to be a&s;&s;umed from an, <HI>at lea&s;t, equivocal expre&s;&s;ion.</HI> Be&s;ides, to a public body appointed to fix upon another public body, upon a bu&s;ine&s;s of the greate&s;t importance, &s;urely it mu&s;t &s;eem awkward and indelicate, for the fir&s;t public body to chu&s;e out of them&s;elves, the whole, or 7-8ths of the other, upon an authority &s;o doubtful and di&s;putable, as not preci&s;ely and clearly giving them leave to appoint <HI>a &s;ingle one.</HI></P>
<P>Again; the electors for a pre&s;ident being equal, in every &s;tate, to all the members in each of tho&s;e &s;tates, (&s;enators and repre&s;entatives) taken together, the elec|tors &s;eem to be left to be appointed by the repre&s;enta|tives ONLY, (they being <HI>peculiarly</HI> the public's vice|gerents) in order that our three departments of go|vernment, the pre&s;ident, &s;enate, and repre&s;entative, might be ALL of a piece, ALL the choice of the people; and, therefore, &s;uch electors, when thus cho&s;en to fix upon a pre&s;ident, ought to be as free, un&s;hackled, and inde|pendent, as the members of the a&s;&s;emblies them&s;elves, who are cho&s;en in each &s;tate, to repre&s;ent their re&s;pec|tive citizens at large. This, I think, cannot be denied; and, therefore, the elector, who, antecedent to his ap|pointment, has engaged to vote for any particular per|&s;on,
<PB N="12" REF="032168_0011_0FF167C695B236E8">&s;ins, in my opinion, again&s;t the <HI>&s;pirit and vitals</HI> of the con&s;titution; and, as far as in him lies, is &s;apping it, and introducing precedents of the mo&s;t pe&s;tilential na|ture; preventing the choice of <HI>the chief magi&s;trate</HI> from being as free, and as <HI>equally</HI> the people's choice, as that of the &s;enate and repre&s;entatives, when they ought, <HI>all the three departments,</HI> to be &s;o, as nearly as the peace and &s;afety of the whole United States will admit. If, in any &s;tate, it has unavoidably happened, through acci|dent, their a&s;&s;embly's meeting, or other unpremeditated circum&s;tances, that they have been obliged to &s;train upon the meaning of the con&s;titution, and to chu&s;e electors from among them&s;elves; &s;uch ob&s;tacles ought to be re|moved again&s;t the next election, that &s;o dangerous a practice may not be &s;anctioned by cu&s;tom; and any par|ticular &s;tate, not wi&s;hing to be &s;u&s;pected as unfriendly to the union, will chearfully conform its actions, &s;o as, if po&s;&s;ible, not to interfere with the expectations of the con&s;titution.</P>
<P>Mankind are, generally, &s;o unwilling to &s;ubmit to re&s;traints or rules, that even &s;uch as are made by them|&s;elves, are &s;trangely perverted, to gratify the pre&s;ent moment; or e&s;&s;ential parts of them often neglected, through mere lazine&s;s, or inattention: for in&s;tance, the con&s;titution plainly expects a number of candidates for the pre&s;ident's place; or why the following injunction? <Q>If no per&s;on have a majority, <HI>then,</HI> from THE FIVE HIGHEST on the li&s;t, the &s;aid hou&s;e, &s;hall, in like man|ner, chu&s;e the pre&s;ident.</Q> Or why permit each &s;tate to take one of the two per&s;ons to be cho&s;en, from them|&s;elves? It is owing to mere lazine&s;s, perver&s;ene&s;s, or the arts of intriguing, de&s;igning men, played upon you, that you have been diverted from attending to, and pur|&s;uing this excellent, &s;alutary provi&s;ion? Are you infa|tuated to your own de&s;truction? I wi&s;h with all my heart, no &s;tate of the union would ever, in future, neglect complying with this important <HI>con&s;titutional</HI> right. Had they done this, in the la&s;t election, there would have
<PB N="13" REF="032168_0012_0FF167C8328B25E0">been &s;ixteen candidates from among them&s;elves; and, if each &s;tate had, be&s;ides, cho&s;en the other citizen a dif|ferent one from the choice of any of the other &s;tates, there would have been at lea&s;t &s;ixteen more: What then? We &s;hould have mortified the &s;ly emi&s;&s;aries, <HI>be|hind the &s;cenes,</HI> foreign and dome&s;tic, to &s;ee their <HI>deep</HI> plan, to &s;et us all by the ears with one another, effec|tually defeated. But our delu&s;ion this year, (I cannot help calling it &s;o) may have been permitted, my friends, to happen &s;o early in our national career, as a warning to us in future pre&s;idential elections, to be more cau|tious, and tenacious of &s;ticking as clo&s;e as po&s;&s;ible to the plain meaning and expectation of our con&s;titution, and not take upon us again, to be wi&s;e above what is written. Such a true republican procedure, will not occa&s;ion, in my opinion, much, if any more trouble to congre&s;s, or to any particular &s;tate. But &s;uppo&s;ing it does; let us not <HI>again</HI> be per&s;uaded <HI>out of our &s;en&s;es,</HI> to &s;hrink from it. Our happine&s;s, our independence, our exi&s;tence as a nation, depends greatly on our peace|able, but firm, <HI>collective</HI> exertions in this re&s;pect, for the time to come.</P>
<P>Some of the good effects probably will be,</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, greatly to dimini&s;h, if not to bani&s;h entirely, that too prevailing &s;pirit of jealou&s;y and party, from among us: tho&s;e mo&s;t formidable weapons, which we have &s;o madly put into our enemies hands again&s;t our|&s;elves; and dexterou&s;ly do they know, we clearly &s;ee, when and how to wield them again&s;t us, to their own advantage. How di&s;tre&s;&s;ing is it to perceive a number of our back citizens, too unhappily po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with an opinion, that the citizens on the &s;ea coa&s;t, or near it, having the opportunity, from their &s;ituation, to be &s;oone&s;t and be&s;t informed, take advantage of them, to deceive and blind them into the choice of men be&s;t &s;uitable to them&s;elves, and their purpo&s;es of trade and &s;peculation. Whil&s;t too many of the&s;e, on the other hand, as weakly and groundle&s;sly, &s;eem to di&s;tre&s;s them&s;elves that the
<PB N="14" REF="032168_0013_0FF167CB0C24BBF0">back country want to cram down their throats, by their numbers, whatever mea&s;ures of government they may think proper. To bani&s;h this dreadful daemon, by taking the &s;ting, if po&s;&s;ible, out of tho&s;e &s;ly, ambitious, mi&s;|chief-making go-betweens, of <HI>both town and country,</HI> that rai&s;e and foment the&s;e jealou&s;ies, is the ardent wi&s;h of the writer of this paper. 'Tis a nece&s;&s;ary, but Her|culean ta&s;k; and without your &s;trong exertions, my friends, cannot be effectually done. For the&s;e men, deficient in no arts of effrontery or cajolement, can tran&s;|form them&s;elves, occa&s;ionally, into any characters; tra|velling up and down, backwards and forwards, like Sa|tan, &s;eeking whom they may deceive and pervert, to aid their treacherous or ambitious purpo&s;es. What mi&s;chief have they done in almo&s;t every &s;tate! But &s;o far, happy for us, one whole&s;ome, &s;kilfully applied ca|tholicon, will operate alike in all the &s;tates, and un|doubtedly effect a radical cure. 'Tis this&mdash;Only let us all re&s;olve to entertain no ungenerous &s;entiments of each other, (at lea&s;t, not &s;o as to affect the public at large) remembering that we are all citizens of one and the &s;ame great government; have one great COMMON inter|e&s;t, and that nothing but &s;uch unnatural, &s;hocking, im|politic mi&s;tru&s;ts among one another, can keep us from being as great a government as ever the &s;un &s;hined on. Away, then, with the&s;e jealou&s;ies among our&s;elves; turn all your re&s;entment, my fellow citizens, again&s;t the&s;e &s;ly, political, pretending, bettering gents; the&s;e &s;u&s;|picious zealots for reformation; the&s;e mi&s;chievous pro|pagators of innovation! It warms me beyond mea&s;ure, when I think of their impo&s;itions; e&s;pecially, when I &s;ee how ea&s;ily you &s;wallow them. Can you avoid &s;eeing how the&s;e gents &s;tart them&s;elves into con&s;equence, merely by &s;triving, underhandedly, to &s;et us all in a flame? Their fir&s;t &s;tep, after feeling their power of delu&s;ion, is generally to riggle them&s;elves into our &s;tate a&s;&s;emblies: &s;ucce&s;s here, prompts them, by means of their fluent tongues and pliant con&s;ciences, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by your own
<PB N="15" REF="032168_0014_0FF167D01C035F18">mo&s;t unaccountable infatuation, to look up to a &s;eat in congre&s;s; and often do they gain their ends. After &s;o many in&s;tances of their treading the &s;ame <HI>beaten</HI> path, one after another, is it not a&s;toni&s;hing that you <HI>&s;till</HI> con|tinue to countenance the breed? At lea&s;t, if po&s;&s;ible, in future, prevent their going to congre&s;s to &s;pread their mi&s;chief there. That body hitherto, upon the whole, has given great &s;atisfaction; too many of the&s;e ambitious dividers among them, will, if not prevented in time, probably over&s;et us all. Here act like true, generous federali&s;ts; prefer the general, to your particular good, and keep them at home, though you di&s;like their com|pany, if you can do no better, by all the means in your power. If each &s;tate would only &s;o far baulk &s;uch ini|mical citizens in their ambitious career, we &s;hould &s;oon not only get rid of them, but demon&s;trate to all the world, that for a man to ri&s;e in the United States, was only by noble, manly, virtuous means; by &s;incerely and &s;teadily promoting the general welfare; by overlooking &s;mall inconveniences; by treating &s;mall errors with ten|derne&s;s, and by di&s;intere&s;tedly endeavouring to heal tho&s;e of con&s;equence, by fair, friendly and candid rea|&s;oning. But rea&s;oning will have no effect upon the men ju&s;t hinted at; they are callous to every noble, generous, tender feeling; <HI>&s;elf is their all.</HI> But our keeping clo&s;e to the expectations of the con&s;titution, will much le&s;&s;en even their power of doing mi&s;chief, in many re&s;pects.</P>
<P>Another advantage is this: that no foreign nation would hardly attempt, <HI>again,</HI> to interfere in our elec|tions, from the little pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s in corrupting &s;ixteen &s;tates, chu&s;ing their chief magi&s;trate <HI>at one and the &s;ame time.</HI> And &s;uppo&s;e the found means to tam|per with three or four, the re&s;t would be fully &s;ufficient to &s;helter us from the bad effects of their corruption. But, could our enemies, them&s;elves, have wi&s;hed for a finer opportunity, than that given them at our la&s;t elec|tion, to chu&s;e a chief magi&s;trate for us; having then to manoeuvre with the parties of only two men, pitted
<PB N="16" REF="032168_0015_0FF167D1B5878D60">again&s;t one another <HI>by our&s;elves.</HI> This certainly was making fine &s;port for, and co&s;ting them le&s;s daubing, and le&s;s trouble.</P>
<P>Again; out of the thirty-two citizens to be cho&s;en by the electors of the &s;ixteen &s;tates, only two, by the con|&s;titution, could be approved. This, far from occa&s;ion|ing any heart-burnings to the other thirty citizens, they would rather think it an honour (as it certainly would be) to have been <HI>&s;o far</HI> di&s;tingui&s;hed by their fellow citizens in their different &s;tates, and held up as worthy of the mo&s;t important offices; and though kept back for the pre&s;ent, would be like a corps of re&s;erve again&s;t the next election, with this advantage to the public in general, that in the interim, we may all grow better acquainted with the real merit of each; and if elected again by their own citizens, it would be a high &s;ign of their fixed reputation.</P>
<P>Another advantage of this &s;trict adherence to the con|&s;titution, would be, that the nation in general, the United States them&s;elves, could not be reflected on, as carrying even the appearance of countenancing parties; whereas, in the la&s;t election, the nation &s;eemed to &s;plit it&s;elf into two parties, through <HI>predilection</HI> for two citi|zens; a long noted, dreadful rock, a Cae&s;ar and Pom|pey, a Scylla and Charybdis. We ought to have <HI>no predilection</HI> for any citizen. 'Tis of no con&s;equence to the nation, what citizen, <HI>from one end of it to the other,</HI> is at our head, &s;o that he is rightly cho&s;en; an hone&s;t man, a &s;teady, firm federali&s;t, no party man, of good &s;ound common &s;en&s;e, and otherwi&s;e con&s;titutionally qualified. And here, I hope, I &s;hall be pardoned for &s;aying, I always looked upon tho&s;e as very weak friends, or artful, in&s;idious, undermining enemies, who made the execution of our pre&s;ident's office &s;o difficult, as requiring &s;uch extraordinary, uncommon talents. Plain failing &s;uits our con&s;titution be&s;t: tricks, twi&s;tings, jo&s;t|lings, and deep laid, equivocal &s;ubterfuges in treaty-making, let European powers divert each other with,
<PB N="17" REF="032168_0016_0FF167D3569812A8">and welcome. Our thou&s;and league di&s;tance from the&s;e cunning, double refined politicians, (with whom, the le&s;s we have to do, the better) is not among the lea&s;t of the ble&s;&s;ings we have to thank a kind Providence for&mdash; Capitulations or treaties, with either Great-Britain or France, we have experienced already, mean any thing, every thing, or nothing, at times, as may &s;uit either. But let us mind our own bu&s;ine&s;s; take as much care as we can of our&s;elves; be a party in none of their wars; what treaties we may find it nece&s;&s;ary to make with them, let them not be of long duration, and let us, on our parts, keep them faithfully. Hone&s;ty is the be&s;t and true&s;t policy&mdash;I think we have hitherto ob&s;erved this rule, and hope we &s;hall always. Our pre&s;ident, in treaty making, has the &s;enate to con&s;ult; without two-thirds of the members pre&s;ent, agreeing and advi&s;ing him to make a treaty, he cannot do it. What great dif|ficulty then, can ari&s;e to an hone&s;t man, qualified as ju&s;t mentioned, with &s;uch a&s;&s;i&s;tance, that he can &s;cruple to encounter?</P>
<P>No &s;tate, or number of &s;tates &s;hould, in my opinion, give the lea&s;t rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect, that they wi&s;h to &s;et up or name, upon the&s;e occa&s;ions, <HI>directly or indirectly,</HI> any man or men, in a manner that may carry the mo&s;t di&s;tant rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect they wi&s;h to pu&s;h him or them through the re&s;t of the &s;tates; the more delicacy &s;hewn, the better; let every &s;tate be left <HI>entirely</HI> to it&s;elf. Such a cautious, <HI>unmeddling</HI> behaviour in each &s;tate, will na|turally promote harmony, and di&s;card every degree of &s;u&s;picion and jealou&s;y among&s;t our&s;elves as &s;eparate &s;tates. Now, added to this, if men, ready at their pen, wedded to the con&s;titution, of true, <HI>vital</HI> philanthropy, would, from the time the election notice to chu&s;e another pre&s;ident is given out, 'till the very day of election ar|rived, be as pre&s;&s;ing as their powers of language will permit them, to enforce to the con&s;titutional electors of each &s;tate, the importance and duty of their appoint|ment; the great dependence the public had on their faith|fully

<P>Finding that the import of the few minutes I had made, with regard to the in&s;ulting appeal of the French mini&s;ter to the people at large, has been laid before you by much better pens, in the public prints; I &s;hall now content my&s;elf with ob&s;erving, that a &s;tranger phenome|non has hardly been hard of in the political world, than that an ab&s;olute monarch over one and the &s;ame people, &s;hould, for the manife&s;t intere&s;t of that nation, a&s;&s;i&s;t another people to recover their liberties, and become republicans; that that very nation, but a few years there|after &s;hould guillotine that monarch, in order to become republicans them&s;elves; and, when hardly fixed as &s;uch, &s;hould, regardle&s;s of a &s;olemn treaty with the people they had a&s;&s;i&s;ted, like free-booters, &s;uddenly and unju&s;|tifiably fall upon their trade, and intermeddle with their government, in a manner they, them&s;elves, have &s;hewn all the world they would not &s;uffer the lea&s;t glimp&s;e of an attempt. What can this proceed from, but a roman|tic giddine&s;s of a re&s;tle&s;s power, &s;etting it&s;elf <HI>no bounds;</HI> or, not unlikely, prompted be&s;ides, by a jealou&s;y of our ri&s;ing importance among the trading nations of the world, and wi&s;hing to check it? And here, by the bye, we &s;hall much deceive our&s;elves, if we imagine the other trading nations of Europe, are without the like jealou&s;y; for, however they may differ in other re&s;pects, they &s;eem not far from being unanimous in this. I only wi&s;h we were as firmly agreed, in pur&s;uing our own common in|tere&s;t and &s;upporting our con&s;titution and government; harbouring no mi&s;tru&s;ts of either of its departments;
<PB N="19" REF="032168_0018_0FF167DB6959C8F0">Their management, for eight years pa&s;t, having &s;hewn them, upon the whole, not unworthy or incapable of their tru&s;t. We had it not in our power to &s;end angels; as men, they have acquitted them&s;elves to the admira|tion of all the world. Any political differences that may ari&s;e in <HI>particular</HI> &s;tates, &s;hould, like <HI>family variances,</HI> be kept <HI>within</HI> tho&s;e &s;tates. Congre&s;s ought not to be affected by them; and, indeed, will not, I think, if our elections are managed &s;trictly, according to the letter and &s;pirit of the con&s;titution.</P>
<P>No foreign mini&s;ter whatever, I think, has a right to make appeals to the people at large; but the French mini&s;ter has done this. On &s;uch occa&s;ions <HI>particularly,</HI> my friends, every re&s;pectful mark of confidential affec|tion, ought to be &s;hewn to all our three departments of government, that it may be &s;een how ready the people are to give them every &s;upport in their power; and all fo|reign mini&s;ters be convinced, that any little, indirect ar|tifices of that &s;ort, only &s;erve to unite the people, if po&s;|&s;ible, more firmly among them&s;elves, to oppo&s;e all &s;uch attempts, and to &s;hew, in the &s;tronge&s;t manner, their &s;trict attention to their own rulers.</P>
<P>I cannot laugh at my fellow citizens, I am &s;ure, for their zealous, uncommon attachment to the French na|tion, on account of their aid in our &s;truggle with Great-Britain; for, I believe, few have been more &s;o than my&s;elf. That their intere&s;t, as a nation, induced them to exert them&s;elves to make the diver&s;ion they did, I never had the lea&s;t doubt of: their not doing it <HI>before</HI> Burgoyne's defeat, that <HI>capital</HI> turn of the war in our favour, &s;hewed their <HI>cautious</HI> re&s;olve to be on the <HI>&s;ure</HI> &s;ide. Yet, &s;till, they had a right to our gratitude, but, not that we &s;hould involve our&s;elves in ruin, or neglect our own pre&s;&s;ing affairs as a nation. But now, my friends, we mu&s;t have eyes &s;urely that &s;ee not, if their <HI>very great love and friend&s;hip</HI> do not appear to us in their <HI>genuine</HI> colours, every atom, &s;elf-intere&s;ted <HI>to the extreme;</HI> craf|tily intended to make us merely their puppets; to move
<PB N="20" REF="032168_0019_0FF167DE3613CBB8">by, and <HI>only</HI> by their wire. But, my fellow citizens, be afraid of only <HI>their intrigues,</HI> again&s;t which, by what we have <HI>already &s;een,</HI> we mu&s;t be well a&s;&s;ured, we cannot be too much on our guard; their long, well-train|ed emi&s;&s;aries are but <HI>every where</HI> among&s;t us. Quiet re&s;ignation to the re&s;olves of the government <HI>we, our|&s;elves,</HI> have &s;et up, is my <HI>uppermo&s;t political maxim.</HI> But, exclu&s;ive of this, I never thought I &s;hould have been brought to like the Briti&s;h treaty, half &s;o well as I do now: Providence &s;eems to have thrown it in our way, as the means to bring about our being weaned, <HI>in time,</HI> from our over-ardent, too rapturous French love-&s;it. But do not, my friends, &s;urmi&s;e from hence, that I mean, indirectly, to per&s;uade you to a relap&s;e to your former flame; by no means: we cannot but, by this time, know them both right well; to divide you is equally their aim. Corruption, we all know, is the mo&s;t powerful wedge of divi&s;ion: watch, therefore, all tho&s;e &s;ubjects which &s;eem to have a crack ready to receive this wedge; keep a &s;trict look out here, and your political peace and happine&s;s will, in all probability, be la&s;tingly &s;ecured. On our &s;ea coa&s;ts they may &s;cratch us; but not much, even there, if our country and other friends are alert to a&s;&s;i&s;t us. But, in the end, I am fully per&s;uaded, they will deeply wound them&s;elves. For what can the French, THEMSELVES ALONE, bring very formidable again&s;t the United States? In what a number of &s;hips and tran&s;ports? And, <HI>while bringing,</HI> to how many accidents expo&s;ed, in cro&s;&s;ing the Atlantic? And for what national purpo&s;e to them, <HI>cui bono?</HI> We have been obliged to fight, and though all of us deprecate being reduced to that <HI>unna|tural</HI> nece&s;&s;ity again; yet, if compelled, there is not the lea&s;t doubt that our citizens, from one end of the union to the other, will turn out again with the <HI>like</HI> &s;pirit, and advantaged by <HI>&s;ome</HI> experience, again&s;t any invaders, however giddily and romanticly impelled; relying on the &s;ame providential a&s;&s;i&s;tance that has never failed us hitherto.</P>

Numbers freely allow, theoretically at lea&s;t, that all governmental power ought to &s;pring from the people at large. But mo&s;t of the&s;e very men again &s;ay, that prac|tically, they, the people, have from all ages &s;hewn, that they know not how to u&s;e power when they have it, or to be contented <HI>long,</HI> under con&s;titutions that have &s;prung <HI>entirely</HI> from them&s;elves. Our's is of this &s;ort, in the ample&s;t manner: it has not only &s;prung, but, IN EVERY STEP, proceeded <HI>under</HI> the people's au&s;pices; and, at la&s;t, has &s;olemnly received their con&s;ent.</P>
<P>You may, perhaps, think me, my fellow citizens, a very great enthu&s;ia&s;t to our con&s;titution, when I give it as my &s;incere opinion, that the world never had &s;o good a one manufactured by man. Let all of us, therefore, join heart and hand to make it as la&s;ting as po&s;&s;ible, and have the honour to &s;uperannuate &s;uch a&s;&s;ertions, &s;o ex|tremely derogatory, di&s;graceful and mortifying to hu|man nature. To countenance no tamperers with it, will much forward &s;uch an animating re&s;olution. As the I&s;raelites were ordered to have the words which Mo&s;es commanded them, in their hearts, and to write them on the po&s;ts of their hou&s;es, and on their gates; &s;o let us imi|tate this injunction with our con&s;titution, that excellent, (I think) heavenly gift <HI>al&s;o,</HI> by having it hung up in the mo&s;t con&s;picuous places in our hou&s;es; and, if the fare|well legacy of our worthy friend, Pre&s;ident Wa&s;hington, was joined with it, our ri&s;ing generation, in my opinion, would want nothing farther, compleatly to under&s;tand, admire and love it. I always was, and very early, in congre&s;s, &s;hewed my&s;elf again&s;t any irregular predilec|tion of a citizen to any office whatever; but, when re|gularly elected, and he has &s;erved with reputation to him&s;elf, and done the public every &s;ervice that could be expected from him in his &s;tation; we thus have had va|lue received, and ought, in our turn, from gratitude, as good policy, to &s;hew him, in his retirement, all the re&s;|pect and honour we can, &s;uitable to the &s;tation he has held.

<P>Like true republicans, my friends, whatever is once con&s;titutionally carried, whether by a &s;ingle, or number of votes, the very nature, the foundation-&s;pring of our con&s;titution, call upon you to &s;ubmit quietly to, and to &s;upport it, if nece&s;&s;ary; otherwi&s;e, as far as is with you, you &s;eem to turn tyrants, determined to carry, at all events, your own opinion, joined with <HI>the fewe&s;t,</HI> again&s;t the con&s;titutional re&s;olve, though attended with <HI>the greate&s;t</HI> number of votes.

<P>The calling conventions of the people, on general governmental affairs, I confe&s;s, I am now no friend to. During our &s;truggle with Great-Britain, they were &s;ome|times unavoidable. The lea&s;t objectionable in&s;tance, &s;eems to me, is, when the pre&s;ident, after having duly con&s;ulted the &s;enate about a treaty, <HI>&s;till</HI> appears to be (as it were) at bay, and therefore defers putting his fiat thereto, as if wi&s;hing to know the general opinion with|out; here, if conducted with propriety and decency, they may, perhaps, be &s;ometimes of u&s;e.</P>
<P>Members, &s;ent from each particular &s;tate, when met in congre&s;s, belong, certainly, <HI>to the whole nation at
<PB N="23" REF="032168_0022_0FF167E6B7727540">large,</HI> to con&s;ult for their general welfare, <HI>as one body.</HI> They ought, therefore, to go unfettered. That mem|ber who will &s;uffer him&s;elf to be fettered, in my opinion, is not worthy of his &s;eat. He cannot be a true, firm, &s;taunch federali&s;t at heart: for, as the poet &s;ays, truly,
<Q><L>"Man, like the gen'rous vine, SUPPORTED lives,</L>
<L>"The &s;trength he gains, is from TH' EMBRACE he gives.</L></Q></P>
<P>So a &s;ingle &s;tate, the more &s;trongly it <HI>embraces</HI> the whole general intere&s;t united, the more it will find, in the end, its own real importance promoted and <HI>&s;trength|ened,</HI> and on the mo&s;t &s;olid ba&s;is. And the particular member, who <HI>uniformly</HI> acts on this principle, will find his own reputation, not only in the &s;tate that &s;ent him, among men of true worth, fixed upon the mo&s;t reput|able and la&s;ting footing; but, among the re&s;t of the &s;tates, he will always be mentioned with the highe&s;t e&s;teem.</P>
<P>No man has more heart-felt joy than my&s;elf, to find our young nation, but of ye&s;terday, already become the a&s;ylum from tyranny, wherever &s;hewing it&s;elf. Let our fellow men come and welcome, from any where and in any numbers, we have room enough for them all. The only dread to be apprehended <HI>to them, as well as to our|&s;elves,</HI> is the mi&s;chievous u&s;e, artful, wicked men, (and too many &s;uch we have) may make of the long fixed habits and bia&s;es they may bring with them; by cun|ningly playing and practi&s;ing upon them the&s;e habits, to pervert them to their own diabolical purpo&s;es, before we have time to get thoroughly acquainted with each other.</P>
<P>Men devoted to particular, ancient families, having had famous names, from their infancy, &s;ounded in their ears, and applauded like demi-gods, in the &s;ports and &s;ongs of their native country; I &s;ay, men of this ca&s;t, are too apt to be taken in by de&s;igning, watchful way-layers. In the beginning of our &s;truggle with Great-Britain, we had a formidable number of Scotch, in
<PB N="24" REF="032168_0023_0FF167E855A0F8D8">North-Carolina, &s;o infatuated to the race of Stuart, as to cau&s;e much trouble to them&s;elves and us. From &s;ome items, not very long &s;ince in the papers, with regard to &s;u&s;pect, there may be &s;ome du&s;t attempted to be kicked up among&s;t tho&s;e of that nation, to put them upon that, or &s;ome other family track. But, my Iri&s;h friends, be on your guard: I take the liberty to give you this hint, as being of Iri&s;h extract my&s;elf, by the mother's &s;ide, who&s;e father was a native of Ireland, whom I am named after.</P>
<P>Your open, manly, generous, un&s;u&s;pecting &s;pirit, is well known; &s;o is the tincture of credulity, naturally &s;pringing therefrom, as well known. Here you have <HI>often</HI> been, here you will &s;till <HI>often</HI> be played upon, and your greate&s;t caution is nece&s;&s;ary to prevent it. Your di&s;tre&s;&s;es in Ireland, we have heard of; have felt and &s;ympathized with you on that occa&s;ion. We are happy to know our country can relieve you; and you will &s;oon find your&s;elves, in all probability, actually relieved, if you do not &s;uffer your&s;elves to be cajoled into parties to di&s;tre&s;s us, and, in the end, di&s;tre&s;s and di&s;appoint your&s;elves of that a&s;&s;i&s;tance you wi&s;h for. You are now in a land, that with half the indu&s;try and prudence you were obliged to u&s;e Ireland, you may gain a landed property, all <HI>really your own,</HI> &s;ufficient to &s;upport your|&s;elves and families decently and independently. Let this very heart-chearing pro&s;pect add &s;purs to your in|du&s;try; &s;trive to ri&s;e gradually, peaceably and hone&s;tly, and pay no attention to foreign emi&s;&s;aries, emissaries, or to re&s;tle&s;s, de&s;igning, ambitious men, among&s;t our&s;elves, wi&s;hing to come country or family over you, or, in &s;ome other artful manner, to draw our now COMMON country into confu&s;ion, for their <HI>&s;elfi&s;h</HI> ends. Take this in good part, my worthy, un&s;u&s;picious friends, however imper|tinent and officious you may think it; in whatever light it may appear, or be made to appear to you, I am con|&s;cious it comes from an unde&s;igning brea&s;t, that loves
<PB N="25" REF="032168_0024_0FF167E9FA65CC70">you, and wi&s;hes for nothing more than to &s;ee peace, har|mony, and univer&s;al philanthropy promoted, not only from one end of the United States, but from one end of the world to the other.</P>
<P>I am per&s;uaded, from what I have &s;een, that more than half the misfortunes of any con&s;equence, that have happened among&s;t us, has been cau&s;ed from the precipi|tation of hone&s;t men, not aware of, or giving them&s;elves <HI>time</HI> to guard again&s;t the &s;ecret, deep-laid, round-about ambu&s;hes of crafty knaves, indefatigably labouring to have no body credited but them&s;elves; and mo&s;t of the&s;e men, &s;o deceived, have been convinced too late, as well for their's, as the public's peace, of their own ha&s;ty, infatuated credulity, being the &s;ole occa&s;ion of all the mi&s;chief.</P>
<P>My reader, &s;till permit an old man one &s;mall digre&s;|&s;ion. Little things, mere names and &s;ounds, have &s;ome|times con&s;iderable effects. I have often wi&s;hed the name of our nation was Columbia; and, more than once, took, when I had a right, &s;ome pains to have it &s;o. One of our citizens calling him&s;elf a Columbian, would &s;ound, I confe&s;s, more <HI>hone&s;tly</HI> in my ear, than now, as in com|mon, calling him&s;elf an American, and, I am &s;ure, more harmoniou&s;ly than <HI>an United States man;</HI> or than, by an awkward periphra&s;e, (that few, if any, can bring them&s;elves to) <HI>a man of the United States.</HI> From hence, it &s;eems to me, the word <HI>American,</HI> is &s;o, continually, by foreigners as well as by our&s;elves, applied to our per&s;ons, trade, cu&s;toms, &amp;c. as, the American trade, an American &s;hip, &amp;c. &s;carcely ever, I believe, <HI>an United States &s;hip,</HI> &amp;c. Again; the word American, (citizen being <HI>under&s;tood,</HI> &s;eldom <HI>expre&s;&s;ed</HI>) &s;tands alone, which, every time I hear it named, methinks I hear the &s;hade of the great Columbus reproaching us for abetting and continuing the cheat upon him, who, though like Horace, he might &s;ay <HI>exegi monumentum oere perennius;</HI> yet, that republicans &s;eem to wi&s;h, and even to take pains to de&s;troy it: for, is it not full as ea&s;y for one of
<PB N="26" REF="032168_0025_0FF167ECE6604F70">our citizens to &s;ay abroad, I am a Columbian; which, too, if adopted, would be peculiar and preci&s;e, than to &s;ay, as they do, <HI>indi&s;tinctly,</HI> I am an American; merely to avoid, as it &s;eems to me, this uncouth expre&s;&s;ion, I am <HI>a United States man;</HI> or, this round-about one, <HI>I am a citizen of the United States.</HI> This &s;hews what pains is taken among&s;t us, and how much out of the common road, to countenance inju&s;tice. Pardon this &s;en&s;ibility in favour of the fame of a man, dead &s;everal hundred years &s;ince.</P>
<P>The writer of this paper is an old public &s;ervant. No citizen, high or low, in or out of office, from one end of the United States to the other, was earlier than he, in the Briti&s;h &s;truggle. He, like the widow with her mite, put his all into that cau&s;e, his per&s;on; his &s;ervices to the utmo&s;t of his power; his property of town and country, were all, from the fir&s;t to the la&s;t of that &s;trug|gle, at the public &s;ervice, and made by them, at times, very free with, for which he never demanded, or wi&s;hed to demand, one farthing compen&s;ation; excepting in the three fir&s;t congre&s;&s;es, to which he had the honour, un|solicited, to be called out by his fellow citizens; of the provi&s;ion for that &s;ervice, he partook.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, indeed, when his country property was &s;e|que&s;tered, and his town, though under protection of a capitulation, taken from him, was in very little better &s;ituation; him&s;elf &s;ent and made a clo&s;e pri&s;oner at Augu&s;tine; his family &s;hipped off to Philadelphia, and in di&s;tre&s;s there; he then &s;hared part of &s;ome public a&s;&s;i&s;tance, which he afterwards <HI>repaid</HI> to our public trea&s;urer, with intere&s;t. Not improbably, it may be &s;aid, vanity is the impul&s;e here; be it &s;o, my reader. But I intreat you to believe it forced out from a wi&s;h to procure attention to the VERY IMPORTANT HINTS in this paper, as coming from a well-known, independent, friendly fellow citizen, devoted to our con&s;titutional union, and therefore,</P>
