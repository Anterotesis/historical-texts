<HEAD>A TRIBUTE TO THE UNITED STATES. A POEM.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>LONG have I &s;ought, be&s;et with grievous toil,</L>
<L>To gain AMERICA'S applauded &s;oil,</L>
<L>To fly a Land oppre&s;s'd with bleeding woes</L>
<L>That &s;avage war and tumult only knows;</L>
<L>To feel no more Corruption's growing force,</L>
<L>Of griefs the &s;pring, my Country's baneful cur&s;e;</L>
<L>To &s;ee no more the pageantry of &s;tate,</L>
<L>That kings command and princes can create:</L>
<L>Nor view the potentate with haughty nod,</L>
<L>Exact an homage due alone to GOD.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Joyful I pre&s;s the ground with FREEDOM ble&s;t,</L>
<L>Where FRANKLIN liv'd with &s;elf-emblazen'd cre&s;t,</L>
<L>Where WASHINGTON his grateful Country brought</L>
<L>Calm Independance, Liberty of thought;</L>
<L>Snucck the &s;tern &s;ceptre from the Tyant's hand,</L>
<L>And bli&s;s re&s;tor'd to all his native Land.</L>
</LG>

<L>This Country once in Natures rude&s;t &s;tate,</L>
<L>Where no fine feeling did the brea&s;t elate,</L>
<L>Where Wedlock's laws no human being ble&s;t,</L>

Where War de&s;tructive ravag'd ev'ry plain,</L>
<L>And parent by the child was often &s;lain;</L>
<L>This Country now another a&s;pect wears,</L>

<L>Here comely Peace, the nymph of placid mien,</L>
<L>With &s;miling vi&s;age gladdens ev'ry &s;cene:</L>
<L>War's brazen trump no more is heard to &s;ound,</L>
<L>No panting cour&s;ers &s;hake th'embattled ground,</L>

<L>Survey this Country, view its ble&s;&s;ings o'er,</L>
<L>Who would not court its ho&s;pitable &s;hore?</L>
<L>Here Independance holds her &s;miling reign,</L>
<L>Of laws de&s;potic none can here complain:</L>
<L>Freedom, the birth-right of the human &s;oul,</L>
<L>None here di&s;pute, and none would here controul:</L>

<L>From Freedom's &s;ource derive their noble laws.</L>

<L>Be ever &s;acred that eventful hour</L>
<L>When fir'd with England's vile abu&s;e of pow'r,</L>
<L>The peaceful Coloni&s;ts indignant ro&s;e,</L>
<L>To meet oppre&s;&s;ion and her yoke oppo&s;e.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For ju&s;tice &s;truggling, and for human right,</L>
<L>How many &s;unk to everla&s;ting night:</L>
<L>Fell, bravely fell, deplor'd by ev'ry eye,</L>
<L>From ev'ry brea&s;t eliciting the &s;igh.</L>
</LG>

<L>Where Quebec's rocks with tow'ring &s;ummits ri&s;e,</L>
<L>And proudly &s;oaring point towards the &s;kies,</L>
<L>MONTGOMERY, the leader of his train,</L>
<L>Crown'd with the laurel, at the &s;iege was &s;lain.</L>
<L>In that &s;ad hour each heart with &s;orrow bled,</L>
<L>And ev'ry Mu&s;e dejected hung her head.</L>
<L>Thalia mournful, threw her ma&s;k away,</L>
<L>Beat her bare brea&s;t, and wept the live-long day.</L>

<L>But yet, lamented &s;hade, the Mu&s;e &s;hall &s;ave</L>
<L>Thy &s;hining virtues from the clay-cold grave:</L>
<L>Throughout the world where Freedom &s;ouths to re&s;t,</L>
<L>Where love of Liberty exalts the brea&s;t,</L>
<L>The fame &s;hall live, thy deeds &s;hall grace the page</L>
<L>Of ri&s;ing poets in &s;ome future age;</L>
<L>Ev'n li&s;ping babes be taught thy name to &s;ound,</L>
<L>Their infant hearts exulting with a bound.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But turn, O Mu&s;e, where rural &s;cenes invite,</L>
<L>Where Nature's charms can ev'ry eye delight.</L>
<L>Lo! Philadelphia ri&s;ing from the main.</L>
<L>With Sylvan beauties cheers the happy &s;wain.</L>
<L>The Delaware with ample channel laves</L>
<L>The flow'ry banks that court its &s;ilver waves:</L>
<L>Ships from all empires on its bo&s;om roll,</L>
<L>And waft their riches from the furthe&s;t pole.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The bu&s;y trader hails the cheerful day</L>
<L>That &s;afe conducts the ve&s;&s;el to its bay;</L>
<L>With joyful heart beholds the bark draw near,</L>
<L>At length releas'd from ev'ry painful fear.</L>
<L>The ve&s;&s;el o'er the &s;urface lightly glides,</L>
<L>The ri&s;ing keel the foaming &s;urge divides;</L>
<L>The cordage cracks, the &s;ails exulting &s;well,</L>
<L>The waving banner &s;trives its joy to tell.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But, here, O Mu&s;e, in pity drop the tear</L>
<L>O'er the dead body, o'er the untimely bier:</L>
<L>To parent, kindred, tune thy plaintive &s;trains,</L>
<L>That felt the Pe&s;tilence con&s;ume their veins:</L>
<L>Their lo&s;s deplore, and rai&s;e the pen&s;ive &s;igh</L>
<L>For tho&s;e who mourn with &s;orrow &s;treaming eye,</L>
<L>A Father, child, a brother or a friend,</L>
<L>That healing pity once them&s;elves could lend.</L>
</LG>

<L>If o'er this &s;cene a retro&s;pect we take,</L>
<L>How ev'ry object &s;orrow doth awake.</L>
<L>Here in the &s;olemn &s;tillne&s;s of the night,</L>
<L>The bleeding heart wept o'er the chilling &s;ight</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="033609_0005_0FF7A83F04795AF0">
Of victims &s;eiz'd with pe&s;tilential bla&s;t,</L>
<L>In painful angui&s;h breathing out their la&s;t:</L>
<L>In each &s;ad &s;treet was heard the dying moan,</L>
<L>And ev'ry gale came loaded with a groan.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Here widows weeping o'er their hu&s;bands' bier.</L>
<L>With looks di&s;tracted drop the briny tear,</L>
<L>Or rend the air with pity moving &s;trains,</L>
<L>That echo from the walls, the hills, the neigb'ring plains.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>There tender mothers act the parent's part,</L>
<L>And mourn their offspring with a bur&s;ting heart,</L>
<L>While friendle&s;s orphans in the &s;treets are found</L>
<L>That view their parents lifele&s;s on the ground.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Sad was the &s;cene, dejecting was the &s;ight</L>
<L>Of bodies carry'd by the moon's pale light,</L>
<L>To where the church-yard's &s;atiated cave</L>
<L>At ev'ry part di&s;play'd the new-made grave!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But turn, O Mu&s;e, from &s;cenes of woe and grief,</L>
<L>To themes congenial fly thee for relief.</L>
<L>Soon as the Spring, at Nature's ju&s;t command,</L>
<L>Her vi&s;it pays to this delightful land,</L>
<L>The con&s;cious &s;wain partakes the genial pow'r,</L>
<L>Ba&s;ks in the breeze, or curls the vernal flow'r.</L>
<L>Each comely Grace to Mu&s;ic's &s;ilver &s;ound,</L>
<L>Leads up the dance, and lightly beats the ground;</L>
<L>Then laugh the vales, the woods their tribute bring,</L>
<L>And to the gales their balmy odours fling.</L>
<L>The cry&s;tal &s;tream with &s;ofter murmur flows,</L>
<L>And &s;weetly whi&s;pers to the breeze that blows;</L>
<L>The ox no more demands his wonted &s;tall,</L>
<L>But courts the mead, and di&s;tant water fall:</L>
<L>The &s;nowy flocks abroad for pa&s;ture range,</L>
<L>The joyful &s;hepherd glories in the change.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But when the Summer's blu&s;hing tints appear,</L>
<L>To deck with flow'rs and fruits the ripen'd year,</L>
<L>When golden harve&s;ts crown each fertile field.</L>
<L>And bending boughs their ro&s;y produce yield,</L>

When through the meads the mazy rivers &s;tray,</L>
<L>And dancing &s;un-beams on the water play,</L>
<L>The hu&s;bandman beholds with grateful eye,</L>
<L>His yellow corn fields &s;mile beneath the &s;ky,</L>
<L>Begins the labour, and with careful hand,</L>
<L>Reaps the ble&s;t produce of his fruitful land;</L>
<L>The ru&s;tic nymphs and &s;wains in bu&s;y throng,</L>
<L>Solace their labours with the woodland &s;ong:</L>
<L>Thus through the day the circling hours roll,</L>
<L>And night rewards them with the flowing bowl.</L>
</LG>

<L>If bards delight in &s;treams and &s;hady grove,</L>
<L>If near the &s;tream the Mu&s;e delights to rove,</L>

<L>The Bay of Che&s;apeak its &s;ource divides,</L>
<L>And to the We&s;t pours out its ample tides,</L>
<L>To where Potowmack curls its &s;ilver waves,</L>

<L>The Schuy&s;kill river fertile in its views,</L>
<L>With &s;cenes romantic charms the rural Mu&s;e.</L>
<L>That loves to pluck the flowret from its &s;ides,</L>
<L>Through which the &s;tream with wave tran&s;lucent glides,</L>
</LG>

<L>The Su&s;quehannah now invites my lay,</L>
<L>Beneath huge mountains pouring forth its way.</L>
<L>Its fragrant banks a fruitful valley &s;hades,</L>
<L>Adorn'd with woods and wild luxuriant glades:</L>
<L>The rural hamlet, where its arms divide,</L>
<L>Enchants the view, and courts the purple tide.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>If any form of government be known,</L>
<L>In which the &s;eeds of equity are &s;own,</L>
<L>To common-wealths it &s;urely is confin'd,</L>
<L>A form that &s;uits the dictates of the mind.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In days of yore, when force and &s;trength prevail'd,</L>
<L>The weaker by the &s;trong became a&s;&s;ail'd,</L>
<L>Till pow'r u&s;urp'd a calm obedience found,</L>
<L>And human rights were trampled on the ground.</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="033609_0007_0FF7A844457F0B20">
Then kings aro&s;e with &s;tern and haughty brow,</L>
<L>To wre&s;t &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion from the croud below,</L>

<L>Approach'd the throne, and bent the &s;uppliant knee.</L>

<L>Have caught the love of &s;elf-created laws,</L>
<L>Nations the yoke of &s;lav'ry have o'erthrown,</L>
<L>And regal pow'r with triumph now di&s;own.</L>

<LG>
<L>This ri&s;ing land, though yet an infant &s;tate,</L>
<L>Enjoys the ble&s;&s;ings that on empires wait,</L>
