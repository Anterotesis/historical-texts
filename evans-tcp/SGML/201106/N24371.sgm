<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>THE &s;pirit of adventure which has increa&s;ed in proportion with the advance|ment of commerce, and of which it is per|haps a parent; has contributed much within the la&s;t hundred years, in expanding the human mind, and extending the bonds which formerly attached a &s;ociety only, round the whole univer&s;e and to each individual of the human &s;pecies.</P>
<P>To the a&s;piring genius of a Columbus we owe our national exi&s;tence. It is to him the civilized world mu&s;t bow with reverence, when the gold and &s;ilver of the New World, together with the immen&s;e &s;ources of improve|ment in natural hi&s;tory, and other &s;ciences, are laid open to their acqui&s;ition by this di&s;covery. It is to him that commerce owes its &s;econd and more vigorous birth, and the art of
<PB N="iv" REF="032239_0004_0FF131BA9A6C7338">navigation that perfection to which it has now arrived; through this art the remote&s;t nations are united in knowledge, manners, and property, more intimately than the inhabitants of two provinces of one nation were in the fifteenth century.</P>
<P>Under what immen&s;e obligations are the &s;ciences laid by the republics of Genoa and Venice, who gave to mankind the di&s;coverer of America and the commerce of the Indies. Portugal and Spain partake of the glory which belongs to tho&s;e mighty enterprizes, in being the nations which opened the bo&s;om of the New Indies, and intrepidly forced a new pa&s;&s;age to the Old, round the boi&s;te|rous cape of Africa. England, in her gallant Raleigh, Holland, in her &s;cientific Dampier, and France in a crowd of enterpri&s;ing navi|gators, have had the honour of carrying the &s;ailing art to its pre&s;ent &s;tate of excellence.</P>
<P>Happy had it been for the Aborigines of the New World, and of many uncivilized
<PB N="v" REF="032239_0005_0FF131C0B78A75C8">nations of the Old, had philanthropy fol|lowed where &s;cience daringly trod, or had the principles of a humane philo&s;ophy kept pace with the intrepidity of heroic adventure.</P>
<P>But it &s;eems to be the de&s;tiny of mankind to arrive at perfection in the &s;ciences by the &s;low progre&s;&s;ion of ages only, and that it is given to the pre&s;ent period to obtain by experience the de&s;ired principles of know|ledge, when men are yet incapable of duly e&s;timating their value, or delay till it is almo&s;t too late to convert them to a proper and immediate u&s;e.</P>
<P>U&s;eful le&s;&s;ons are however taught by that &s;pecies of experience which is derived from the hi&s;tory of nations and individuals. For the travels of men, who have vi&s;ited remote countries and people, whether actuated by the &s;pirit of curio&s;ity or gain, have &s;ignally contributed to the edification of the world at large, and to the intere&s;t of the philo&s;opher, the merchant, and the lover of adventure.</P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="032239_0006_0FF131C279F0C380">
It is not pre&s;umed, however, that in the pre&s;ent work, &s;uch great advantages as have already been derived from the writings of di&s;tingui&s;hed travellers, &s;hould be extended in an eminent degree; far from it; its claims are but the humble &s;hare of medi|ocrity; the object and cour&s;e of travel, which it de&s;cribes, is not &s;u&s;ceptible of extra|ordinary novelty, nor of &s;cientific re&s;earch; &s;ome degree of both, however, we may venture to promi&s;e. Be&s;ides, the circum|&s;tances under which the voyage was taken, and particularly the condition of total blindne&s;s to which the Author was reduced at the conclu&s;ion of it, may readily be con&s;idered as a preventative to the general perfection which the work would probably po&s;&s;e&s;s, if dictated under more favourable and happy circum&s;tances.</P>
<P>The liberal minded citizens of America, to whom this work is dedicated, will freely make the few allowances expected in this part of its character. They, we are con|vinced,
<PB N="vii" REF="032239_0007_0FF131C5D7261620">will not be deficient in their charac|teri&s;tic genero&s;ity, when the circum&s;tances of the publication are con&s;idered; for little did the Author &s;u&s;pect, when he made the notes from which this is compiled, that want of &s;upport &s;hould ever compel him to &s;ubmit his remarks to the critici&s;m of the world.</P>
<P>The &s;tile and form of the compilation, with re&s;pect to words and expre&s;&s;ions, will like|wi&s;e perhaps require to be commented on: but the &s;ame liberal &s;pirit of the candid reader will frame an excu&s;e in his mind at any part expo&s;ed to the &s;hafts of critici&s;m; and kindly omit his remarks, when he &s;hall learn that the work is brought forward by A STUDENT.</P>

<HEAD>A HISTORY, <HI>&amp;c. &amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>READERS of Travels like travellers are rarely &s;atisfied, till they know &s;ome particulars of tho&s;e with whom they are about to embark, in pur&s;uit of advantage or plea&s;ure: without this knowledge, &s;ome di&s;&s;atisfaction, or doubt, will fre|quently take place in their minds. In this view therefore it is that I think proper to introduce a few particulars concerning my&s;elf, which, on any other occa&s;ion, would neither be &s;ufficiently important or intere&s;ting to merit relation: but as the greater part of young men are directed through life more by accident than choice, and many of their fortunes and misfortunes to be placed rather at the door of chance than predi&s;po&s;ition;
<PB N="10" REF="032239_0009_0FF131CE9A119580">&s;o, it will be u&s;eful on this occa&s;ion, to mark the cour&s;e which led me to the Voyage and Travels which I am about to relate, in order that the reader may carry the remembrance of my circum&s;tances and &s;ituation in life, and the part I acted in &s;ome tran&s;actions which I have to de&s;cribe; that I am not an adven|turer of plea&s;ure nor of choice, but one who &s;tarted from the humble walks of private life in &s;earch of a competence, and launched into the ocean of the world with no other pilot than nece&s;&s;ity, or other chart than that of a youthful knowledge of the world, de&s;titute of every &s;tock but that of indu&s;try and an active di&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P>My Father's family, although not popular in point of property, were re&s;pected for their indu&s;try and probity, in the town of King&s;|bury, Wa&s;hington County, &s;tate of New York, where I was born in 1772. Arrived at the age of eighteen, bred up with a di&s;po&s;ition to an active life in common with my countrymen, I was encouraged to com|mence
<PB N="11" REF="032239_0010_0FF131D30CF86B58">a mercantile pur&s;uit at the Town of Alsburgh, in the &s;tate of Vermont; where having re&s;ided, and witne&s;&s;ed the wildly rude and romantic beauties, that &s;ur|rounded Lake Champlain, at the end of fourteen months I found my hopes of &s;ucce&s;s in bu&s;ine&s;s di&s;appointed, and that I mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily &s;eek &s;ome new pur&s;uit.</P>
<P>Hearing it frequently &s;aid that a young man of a moderate education and indu&s;trious habits, with a good recommendation, would be &s;ure of an eligible and con&s;tant employ|ment in the &s;outhern &s;tates, after advi&s;ing with my friends and making the nece&s;&s;ary preparations, I determined to proceed for Charle&s;ton, South Carolina. I &s;et out for Bo&s;ton on hor&s;e-back, where I arrived with|out any very intere&s;ting adventure, and &s;oon obtained a pa&s;&s;age by &s;ea for Charle&s;ton, where I arrived in 20 days after leaving Bo&s;ton Harbour, heartily &s;ick of my fir&s;t &s;ea voyage&mdash;as I called it.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="032239_0011_0FF131D4DD63B650" MS="y">
My circum&s;tances and pro&s;pects on arriving in Charle&s;ton by no means equalled my wants or expectations. Di&s;appointed hopes, and the &s;till predominating turn of my di&s;po&s;ition, prompted me to new pur&s;uits, urged on by the more potent &s;timulus of nece&s;&s;ity, and my efforts were redoubled, but without &s;ucce&s;s. While in this un&s;ettled &s;tate, an offer was made me of a &s;ituation on board a Guinea Trader; the &s;hip had been delayed through the want of a &s;upercargo. I was &s;uf|ficiently qualified, and happy did I con&s;ider my&s;elf in obtaining a &s;ituation reputable in its nature and highly profitable in pro&s;pect.</P>
<P>We &s;ailed from Charle&s;ton the 1&s;t of Dec. 1793, on board the &s;hip Charle&s;ton, J. Con|nelly ma&s;ter, burthen 400 Tons; and after a pa&s;&s;age partly boi&s;terous, and frequently becalmed for &s;everal days, we made the i&s;les of Delos on the 17th January 1794.</P>
<P>The&s;e i&s;lands are nine in number, and afford harbours and &s;afe anchorage in deep
<PB N="13" REF="032239_0012_0FF19E424CBC6428">water for &s;hips of any burthen; they are &s;ix leagues from the main land of Africa, in 12 deg. 30 min. &s;outh lat. they are inhabited by French and Engli&s;h factors, who find their account in living on tho&s;e i&s;lands in prefer|ence to the main, particularly from the circum&s;tances of accommodation for their &s;hips, which lye here with the greate&s;t &s;afety in all weathers, and that their &s;laves cannot ea&s;ily e&s;cape. The &s;laves are in tho&s;e i&s;lands &s;uffered to go at large, without chains, con|trary to the cu&s;toms on the continent. The &s;urface of the i&s;lands is barren and rocky, but there is abundance of fine fre&s;h water; and provi&s;ions are procured with facility.</P>
<P>From the factors here we learned that the <HI>Ebo</HI> and <HI>Golo</HI> Kings had been at war, the lat|ter of whom having been defeated, and a great part of his army had fallen into the hands of the conqueror, they therefore advi&s;ed us to proceed for the <HI>Reyo-pongo</HI> river, about 25 leagues &s;outh we&s;tward, and from thence the acce&s;s to the <HI>Ebo</HI> nation would be ea&s;ily
<PB N="14" REF="032239_0013_0FF19E4693E769C8">&s;ecured, by a pa&s;&s;age up that river and from thence by land, about three hundred miles from the mouth of this river; they furni&s;hed us with further directions, and a&s;&s;ured us of a certain and good trade.</P>
<P>Agreeably to this information, we provided our&s;elves with &s;uch nece&s;&s;aries as the factors could afford us, and proceeded for the <HI>Reyo-pongo,</HI> which we made on the 5th of Febru|ary, and after chu&s;ing a proper &s;ituation, came to anchor in a hand&s;ome harbour within the northern bank, three leagues from the mouth of the river, clo&s;e to the &s;hore, in view of a luxuriant country, low, and thinly covered with &s;cattered woods and pictu|re&s;que collections of reed. The oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the river appearing in per&s;pective, more bold and ri&s;ing in proportion to its di&s;tance.</P>
<P>The country bore the appearance of being frequently overflowed, which we afterwards learned to be the ca&s;e; the banks were however covered with the mo&s;t exuberant
<PB N="15" REF="032239_0014_0FF19E4AE6765040">richne&s;s, the air was not inten&s;ely hot, the clearne&s;s of the &s;ky charming, and the nights delightfully &s;erene and tranquil.</P>
<P>The river abounds with fi&s;h, of which we caught &s;everal, different in form from any that I had ever &s;een; and the crocodiles from numbers and &s;ize may be con&s;idered as in their native empire when in the <HI>Reyo-pongo;</HI> here the number of beautiful i&s;lands formed by the windings and divi&s;ions of the river into branches afford them a &s;ecure and peaceful retreat.</P>
<P>The tree mo&s;t prominent and con&s;picuous is the palm of various &s;pecies, but particu|larly one which I under&s;tood to be peculiar to Africa, which I &s;hall have occa&s;ion &s;ub&s;eqently to de&s;cribe, with a variety of u&s;es to which it is converted, and which renders its value ine&s;timable to the natives.</P>
<P>On the 6th February we were vi&s;ited by numbers of the natives, who offered to barter
<PB N="16" REF="032239_0015_0FF19E4C78129188">with us fruit and ivory for our hardwares; but finding after we had exchanged a few articles, that they belonged to a nation which had been before repre&s;ented to us as thinly inhabited, and that we could not accommo|date our&s;elves here as we wi&s;hed, we made u&s;e of them to obtain information concerning the country of the <HI>Ebo</HI> king. We fortu|nately &s;ound an interpreter acquainted with that country and the trade, him we engaged, and an expedition was immediately deter|mined upon by the captain.</P>
<P>After &s;ome con&s;ultation, no per&s;on could be found &s;o &s;uitable for the journey as my&s;elf, and the captain propo&s;ed it to me. On viewing the dangers and difficulties that mu&s;t be nece&s;&s;arily attendant on a journey of this kind; in which I was ignorant of the country, and its languages, and without any knowledge of the duties of the charge, but &s;uch as might be derived from in&s;tructions that could not be expected to apply in all ca&s;es that might occur, I was aver&s;e to the
<PB N="17" REF="032239_0016_0FF19E50D80E4F58">attempt, and declined in engaging in it; my rea&s;ons were not deemed &s;atisfactory by the captain, who&s;e orders I mu&s;t obey, and after obtaining as full an account as the poor negro interpreter could afford me, I was obliged to provide the nece&s;&s;aries for the journey, arranged my affairs on board the &s;hip, and prepared for the expedition.</P>
<P>An enterprize &s;o hazardous, will natu|rally be conceived as undertaken with con&s;i|derable anxiety and apprehen&s;ion. I was not de&s;titute of re&s;olution, nor unu&s;ed to hazardous expeditions; and a habit of per&s;everance acquired on the borders of the exten&s;ive American Lakes, and on the &s;ides of the Green Mountains, could not be inau&s;picious to an adventurer &s;o young, and much po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the &s;anguine confidence peculiar to that period of life:&mdash;I had but barely entered on the cour&s;e of a journey, in which the flattering allurements of profit were too potent to be conquered by &s;ears or forebodings!</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="032239_0017_0FF19E552F7A01C8" MS="y">
I now &s;atisfied my&s;elf of the knowledge of my guide, of his acquaintance with the languages of the people, and with the cour&s;e of the route which we were to pur&s;ue; and, having taken precautions to cultivate a kind under&s;tanding between my future fellow-traveller and companion, I provided my&s;elf with a &s;tock of ammunition for &s;port and defence, with a ca&s;e of pi&s;tols in my belt, a fu&s;il on my &s;houlder, and a hanger by my &s;ide; my friend <HI>Hurdee</HI> I furni&s;hed with a good fowling piece, a &s;word, a hand&s;ome bow and arrows, purcha&s;ed in the neigh|bouring village, &s;ome powder, &s;hot, flints, trinkets, and a quantity of rum. With the&s;e we landed and &s;et out on the morning of the fourth of February, accompanied by a crood of the natives, men, women and chil|dren, who appeared anxious to do us every &s;ort of kindne&s;s, and aid us by their good offices. They a&s;&s;i&s;ted us in plucking fruit and pa&s;&s;ing over the creeks and gulleys acro&s;s which this days route lay. They left us, however, about two hours before noon, and we retired to the covert to avoid the
<PB N="19" REF="032239_0018_0FF130A958AF4278">heat of the &s;un, and to partake of refre&s;h|ment for the fir&s;t time in this expedition.</P>
<P>About 4 o'clock, P. M. we continued our journey nearly S. E. keeping a di&s;tant chain of mountains that appeared like a mi&s;t, inclining to our left. The river lay before us, extending through a tract of country variegated with clu&s;ters of trees, plains, and &s;pacious &s;wamps, covered with lofty and clu&s;tering reeds, or canes. Here we could mark on the &s;ides of the rivulet the traces of the voracious crocodile, which finds in the&s;e rece&s;&s;es a &s;ecure retreat. Here, likewi&s;e, the windings of poi&s;onous &s;erpents, of which Africa affords &s;uch multitplied variety, are frequently ob&s;erved. In the cour&s;e of this evening my heart frequently palpitated with alarm, and my apprehen&s;ions figured the wide jaws of the dreadful animal, or the poi&s;oned tooth about to &s;trike me, and fini&s;h, by a mi&s;erable death, my journey and my cares. My fellow traveller was not de&s;titute of vivacity, and being a &s;tranger
<PB N="20" REF="032239_0019_0FF19E59CA0BABA8">to fear from this quarter, took occa&s;ion, when he &s;aw me thoughtful as we walked along, to call my mind into action by explaining &s;ome of the African terms, which in the end proved of great utility.</P>
<P>After about two hours march, we reached a deep ravine; through this it was nece&s;&s;ary to pa&s;s, in order to gain the hills which we had to cro&s;s the en&s;uing day, and at the foot of which we were to take our repo&s;e for the night. The &s;ide upon which we &s;tood was mar&s;hy, and that oppo&s;ite to us &s;haggy, and covered with thick irregular underwood. We had been &s;earching for a place convenient to ford, the current appearing too rapid, and too deep, to ven|ture acro&s;s with perfect confidence, when, as I was lo&s;t in a momentary reflection, my companion &s;uddenly roared out that there was a crocodile&mdash;I had &s;carcely power to move: a &s;udden ru&s;tling in the reeds, with a loud plunge in the water, left me totally &s;tupified: <HI>Hurdec</HI> had pur&s;ued the animal
<PB N="21" REF="032239_0020_0FF19E5F9170B4D8">and cau&s;ed his plunging into the water, and now returning, rou&s;ed me from my terror by immoderate laughter. I judged it prudent, however, to conceal as much as po&s;&s;ible my embarra&s;&s;ment, acknowledging that I was in a &s;light degree alarmed. We cro&s;&s;ed the creek in a place that was fordable, and &s;pee|dily a&s;cended the &s;loping &s;ide of the oppo&s;ite bank, which as we a&s;cended thickened with charming timber, and led to a long and winding range of beautiful hills, at the feet of which we could trace the river gradually narrowing to the eye, and receiving the tribute of a thou&s;and little &s;treams that flowed from the woods, and declivities that pre&s;ented them&s;elves in wild but &s;imple grandeur, far as the &s;ight could reach in an ea&s;twardly direction.&mdash;The approach of night, and the &s;un &s;etting behind us, threw an impo&s;ing &s;hade over this land&s;cape that is not capable of de&s;cription.</P>
<P>We concluded to form our encampment in one of the valleys, and accordingly pro|ceeded
<PB N="22" REF="032239_0021_0FF19E6285E32BF0">to light a fire, and for the fir&s;t time guard again&s;t the bea&s;ts of prey, the traces of who&s;e feet I marked with lively appre|hen&s;ion in the cour&s;e of the day, and to keep clear of the monkeys that I learned to expect in great numbers, from the accounts my guide had already given me.</P>
<P>We cho&s;e a &s;ituation &s;omewhat detached from the thickets beneath the rich and lofty palm tree, and having collected wood &s;uffi|cient to &s;u&s;tain large fires during the night, we dre&s;&s;ed our plain but delicious repa&s;t, compo&s;ed our&s;elves to re&s;t, and pa&s;&s;ed a tolerably ea&s;y night, free from every real danger, although I was &s;till in &s;ome fear of the wild bea&s;ts.</P>
<P>Our di&s;tance from the villages that we had left I calculated, to be not more than &s;ixteen miles, having pur&s;ued with little deviation the irregular cour&s;e of the river. To this we were compelled, in order to avoid the ob&s;tructions to which we might have been
<PB N="23" REF="032239_0022_0FF19E64152C5D48">&s;ubjected by the inhabitants who occa&s;ion|ally re&s;ide, at this &s;ea&s;on of the year, conti|guous to the oppo&s;ite bank of the river. To their proximity, <HI>Hurdee</HI> informed me we might attribute the compo&s;ure of the night, and my being relea&s;ed from the terrific howl|ings of wild bea&s;ts.</P>
<P>The opening of the morning was the &s;ignal for our ri&s;ing. Having dre&s;&s;ed our nece&s;&s;ary provi&s;ions of goats fle&s;h over night, we refre&s;hed as appetite required, and after bathing in an adjacent rivulet, we proceeded on our journey. After two hours travel along the &s;kirt of an irregular hill, we di&s;co|vered at &s;ome di&s;tance, &s;everal of the natives &s;cattered apart with bows and arrows: the&s;e <HI>Hurdee</HI> informed me were in pur&s;uit of game. We endeavoured to gain the covert of the wood, but they had al&s;o perceived us, and had formed into two parties, one of which pre|&s;ented them&s;elves in our way, and appeared di&s;po&s;ed to di&s;pute our pa&s;&s;age through the path into which we had turned. They &s;tood
<PB N="24" REF="032239_0023_0FF19E6714CFB688">for a con&s;iderable time with marks of &s;ur|prize, but without the lea&s;t appearance of violent intentions. In the mean time, the other party had approached us at &s;ome di&s;tance behind, where they al&s;o &s;tood fixed with admiration.</P>
<P>My unacquaintance with the temper of the people, and judging of their ferocity by circum&s;tances that belonged to the &s;evere character of the &s;avages of the American Lakes, I &s;ugge&s;ted to my companion my fears of their intentions being ho&s;tile: he made an&s;wer they were friends, and left me little opportunity for further con&s;ideration, when he advanced towards them in a &s;low pace; I followed him in the &s;ame manner.</P>
<P>When we had reached the party in front within about twenty paces, <HI>Hurdee</HI> &s;poke to them in their own language; they appeared much plea&s;ed, and approached us without further re&s;erve; the &s;econd party &s;oon after joined us likewi&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="032239_0024_0FF19E6B5FB3CC88">
My companion informed them of the propo&s;ed extent of our journey; they expre&s;|&s;ed much &s;urprize at our undertaking a journey of &s;uch length, with &s;o few in num|ber, and through countries thickly infe&s;ted by bea&s;ts of prey; this latter part of their information, however, was concealed from me at that time. A party of the&s;e negroes propo&s;ed to accompany us part of our route, to which we a&s;&s;ented, and the whole com|pany partook of refre&s;hment about noon. At 4 o'clock in the evening, as we a&s;cended a hill marked by beaten pathways, the &s;erenity of the &s;ky and the &s;tillne&s;s of the air cau&s;ed me to notice the violent agitation of a tree at &s;ome di&s;tance before us, on the &s;kirt of a &s;hady clu&s;ter: I pointed it out to the guide, and to the negroes; they drew me out of the path into a more open one, and I learned the following particulars of a large &s;nake, who&s;e beauteous folds but cumbrous form, I could di&s;cern upon ap|proaching it at a &s;afe di&s;tance.</P>

This &s;pecies of &s;nake grows to the length of 24 feet, being in diameter from &s;ix to eight inches; its back is of a deep green, intermingled with luminous colours, and its belly of a lighter &s;hade; its motions are &s;low, therefore not dangerous if di&s;covered in time by the traveller. It &s;eizes its prey by &s;tratagem, climbing lofty trees clo&s;e to the pathways of men and cattle: the&s;e it attacks by winding its tail round the trunk of the tree, and letting its fore folds fall on the object it means to de&s;troy; after cru&s;hing it to death in the in&s;tant of &s;urpri&s;e, it devours its victim at lei&s;ure. The negroes complained of &s;ome recent mi&s;chief committed in that neighbourhood, and <HI>Hurdee</HI> &s;ugge&s;ted that the de&s;truction of this &s;nake with our fire arms would be at once ea&s;y to us, and highly agreeable to our good natured fellow-travellers.</P>
<P>We accordingly loaded our guns with two balls each, and having taken a conve|nient po&s;ition &s;o as to fire together, we
<PB N="27" REF="032239_0026_0FF19E6FDD9B44F8">perceived from the noi&s;e, and the blood flowing down the trunk of the tree, that it was &s;everely wounded. It pre&s;ently made a mo&s;t hideous noi&s;e, and vented its rage on the branches of the tree, which having torn in various directions, gave us a more clear view of his violent &s;truggles</P>
<P>I was not perfectly &s;atisfied as to our &s;afety from its rage, and prepared to complete its de&s;truction by another di&s;charge. The negroes who had &s;een with a&s;toni&s;hment the effect of our arms, had retired to &s;ome di&s;|tance behind us; we fired a &s;econd time, and the mon&s;ter fell ga&s;ping to the ground, where it lay a few minutes apparently dying; but &s;uddenly collecting the vigour of de&s;pa|ration and torture, threw it&s;elf into various forms; now it collected it&s;elf, blood flowing from its wounds, in knots and circles, cru&s;h|ing and breaking the young &s;aplings that that grew within his circuit; exhau&s;ted by its &s;truggles and the lo&s;s of blood, the ne|groes approached and helped to complete
<PB N="28" REF="032239_0027_0FF19E716E4E1C58">the cata&s;trophe with their arrows; <HI>Hurdee</HI> employed his hanger, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted in cutting off &s;uch parts of the animal as they cho&s;e, which they did with exultation: they each took &s;uch parts as &s;uited them, and night approaching, we were con&s;trained to &s;eek a convenient place of re&s;t. Our fellow travel|lers re&s;olved to &s;pend the night with us, which gave me con&s;iderable plea&s;ure. We encamped, and fires were kindled in a lovely valley. The negroes fell to dre&s;&s;ing their &s;nake with great glee, and fea&s;ted heartily on its &s;lices and rice cake; while I preferred &s;ome dryed &s;hip beef, which from prejudice I cho&s;e rather than their high flavoured luxurious banquet.</P>
<P>Free from the anxieties of the previous night, and fatigued by the labour and exertions of the day, I lay down in the mid&s;t of them, and &s;lept undi&s;turbed by noi&s;e or care till the break of day, when I awoke refre&s;hed and chearful.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="032239_0028_0FF19E74694D0B38">
The advantage and &s;ecurity derived from our innocent and voluntary fellow travellers, rendered it painful to me to part with them; I &s;ignified my wi&s;h that they would accom|pany us farther; they expre&s;&s;ed &s;ome reluctance, but the promi&s;e of a few trinkets which I &s;hewed them prevailed, and the&s;e children of nature, agreed to accompany us further on our journey, to the foot of certain mountains which they called <HI>Kailoo.</HI></P>
<P>After bathing, a rule which I re&s;olved to pur&s;ue every day when the contiguity of water afforded me an opportunity, and which I pur&s;ued thenceforward; we break|fa&s;ted on our u&s;ual &s;imple fare, and &s;et forward.</P>
<P>After a journey direct E. of about fifteen miles, over a beautiful champain country, we made the banks of the river <HI>Dundy,</HI> running from the N. E. which being too rapid and deep to ford, we were obliged to bend our cour&s;e four miles along the bank;
<PB N="30" REF="032239_0029_0FF19E78B69E48D8">but the heat of the day growing irk&s;ome, we took to the covert and re&s;olved to con&s;truct a raft; we procured timber, and having &s;ecured them by ropes of withy and vine, we cro&s;&s;ed at a convenient bending, and &s;et our&s;elves over by poles, a&s;&s;i&s;ted with great addre&s;s by our fellow travellers, with whom we were now become completely familiar.</P>
<P>This river di&s;played an abundance of various fi&s;h, of which our negroes caught &s;everal with peculiar ingenuity for our eve|ning's repa&s;t; and after a march of four hours we gained a ri&s;ing ground, on the &s;ide of which we determined to &s;pend the night.</P>
<P>The &s;urrounding country in the neigh|bourhood of this river is truly luxuriant; the &s;oil is &s;oft and loamy, producing a variety of elegant flowering &s;hrubs, and fruit trees; among which are the wild orange and limes, with tufts of the rich <HI>bannana</HI> and pine apple. We provided our&s;elves with as
<PB N="31" REF="032239_0030_0FF19E7A488E6248">much as we could carry of the&s;e rich &s;tores, under&s;tanding that our next day's route would be more irk&s;ome and fatiguing.</P>
<P>We ro&s;e early, and as u&s;ual comfortably refre&s;hed; my health was never better than I had hitherto experienced it in this expe|dition, and I &s;eemed to feel an agility of mind and body that was &s;uperior both to danger and fatigue.</P>
<P>The accu&s;tomed formalities of the broiled and roa&s;ted, with the morning de&s;&s;ert and the &s;imple beverage, being di&s;patched, we &s;et forward, with a party of our friendly Africans in front. We had a&s;cended a &s;loping ground, and wi&s;hed to reach by a le&s;s-circuitous route the elevated country which our little party in advance had gained, where we &s;aw and heard them &s;houting for us to ha&s;ten, as we under&s;tood it. We found much difficulty to form a new path, but at length &s;ucceeded, and were exceedingly alarmed to find a youth of about &s;eventeen
<PB N="32" REF="032239_0031_0FF19E7BE2929218">bewailing loudly: his father, a robu&s;t mid|dle aged&punc; cheerful man, had been bitten by a large &s;nake which they call the <HI>Hoopel Koppel;</HI> the animal's head had been cut off by the boy, and the body lay writhing at his feet, while he vented his complaints and the bitterne&s;s of his re&s;entments, in language that I could not comprehend otherwi&s;e than by the vehemence of his actions, and by his empha&s;is. <HI>Hurdee</HI> acquainted me with the particulars of the hone&s;t boy's imprecations; and I ha&s;tened to the old man, whom I found in the mo&s;t tranquil manner applying medi|cine to the wound, which was on the exte|rior of his left thigh. The antidote to this mo&s;t poi&s;onous of &s;nakes is a &s;imple root, which the Africans always carry about them; they chew it to the con&s;i&s;tence of a &s;oft pulp, and apply it like a poultice to the wound; removing it continually as the poi&s;on di&s;co|lours the application, until the chewed root remains of its original colour, when they fini&s;h the operation by wa&s;hing the part affected in clean water, and applying a large
<PB N="33" REF="032239_0032_0FF19E81D48B8580">portion of the root, which they fa&s;ten with a bandage over the wound, where it remaine till the cure is effected. We nece&s;&s;arily halted till the proce&s;s was completed, and as it was tedious, were con&s;trained to prepare for dre&s;&s;ing our mid-day meal earlier than u&s;ual.</P>
<P>The animal that had been thus the cau&s;e of our delay mea&s;ured nine feet without the head, which was flat and &s;omewhat re&s;em|bling the fore part of the <HI>&s;ole</HI> fi&s;h, or black flounder; the tongue forked; the body thick; the back of a dirty yellow and brown, very like the rattle&s;nake The bite is not always curable, to which cau&s;e mu&s;t be attributed the grief of the boy; his father, however, appeared no wi&s;e di&s;con|certed, and we had the plea&s;ure to &s;ee the application come from the wound without the lea&s;t appearance of poi&s;on, after about three hours application. The attention of the&s;e innocent people to their wounded bro|ther, their activity and kindne&s;s in procuring
<PB N="34" REF="032239_0033_0FF19E84C777AEA0">the antidote and encouraging him not fear, was extremely impre&s;&s;ive, and &s;uch as is not always to be &s;een among more poli&s;hed people.</P>
<P>I examined the head of this &s;nake, and the Africans pointed to me the cavities in which he conceals his venom of death. It is contained in a &s;ack, at the roots of the two teeth an&s;wering to the canine teeth; the upper and lower jaws, are likewi&s;e armed with each a &s;maller row of teeth, u&s;ed as I &s;uppo&s;e for ma&s;tication only. The Africans de&s;cribe the effects of this poi&s;on as extremely &s;udden and dreadful, if the antidote is not immediately at hand: in this ca&s;e, the body is &s;aid to &s;well to an uncommon bulk, with excruciating torture: the &s;welling continues till the body bur&s;ts, when death follows and clo&s;es the &s;cene.</P>
<P>We had a difficult journey for the next day, it was therefore agreed to gain the ea&s;tern &s;ide of the hill, or rather mountain,
<PB N="35" REF="032239_0034_0FF19E87C23CFF80">upon which we now were, and having &s;et out about 3 o'clock, we reached the &s;ummit by an ea&s;y march, through a broken and unequal piece of ground; and at about 7 o'clock, being much fatigued, we reached an agreeable &s;ituation, where we propo&s;ed to re&s;t for the night.</P>
<P>The cu&s;tomary preparations of collecting wood for fire, and arranging our rations of food, were &s;carcely made, when one of the Africans &s;ignified with &s;ome alarm that he &s;aw a fire at &s;ome di&s;tance. I had &s;een a &s;mall blaze my&s;elf, a few minutes before; but felt no &s;en&s;e of alarm at it, more than I &s;hould at any other ordinary occurrence, from being unacquainted with the danger. The di&s;tance might be about three leagues, and it was on a mountain from which we were &s;eparated by a deep and gloomy valley; I found that <HI>Hurdee</HI> as well as my other companions were extremely unea&s;y, and &s;ignified that it would be preferable to remove, to a &s;ituation where we &s;hould be
<PB N="36" REF="032239_0035_0FF19E8963EB28F0">be covered from the danger of our fire's being &s;een at a di&s;tance. We accordingly bent our cour&s;e to the &s;outhward round the contiguous hill; and after a march of about a mile and a half, found a convenient &s;helter under a lofty cliff of rocks, where we con|trived to dre&s;s &s;ome veni&s;on, caught the pre|ceding day by one of our Africans, in a &s;nare that he had &s;et for the purpo&s;e. We pa&s;&s;ed the night to a later hour than u&s;ual, in conver&s;ation with our companions, who were to part with us, on their return, in the morning. We &s;lept till the u&s;ual hour the next morning without alarm. The di&s;tance from the water we found to be a very &s;evere inconvenience; &s;o we ha&s;tened our dry repa&s;t, and having di&s;tributed, as I propo&s;ed, a variety of trinkets among our good natured friends, we &s;aw the old man and his &s;on depart in perfect health and &s;pirits, and with &s;ome evidences of regret at our &s;eparation, a &s;entiment which came home to my bo&s;om with new and redoubled &s;en&s;ibility.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="032239_0036_0FF19E90726A4BB8" MS="y">
It was vain to repine, and re&s;olution to per&s;evere and fortitude to bear, were now the only feelings that could be of u&s;e to us. I determined to brave every apprehen&s;ion&mdash; and in a critical time, for we were now on the confines of a nation of who&s;e pacific di&s;|po&s;ition my guide &s;ugge&s;ted &s;ome fears; a matter the more alarming to me, as it was not his u&s;ual character hitherto to betray &s;ymptoms of alarm.</P>
<P>We pur&s;ued our journey, keeping the deepe&s;t covert of the woods, occa&s;ionally a&s;cending every prominent ground that could afford a pro&s;pect of the country before us. This day for the fir&s;t time I &s;aw a Panther; he was di&s;covered by <HI>Hurdee;</HI> he came frequently in &s;ight, but hung down his head and retired into &s;ome neighbouring thicket whenever we turned round to look at him. My guide, &s;imply enough, &s;aid that the bea&s;t was terrified at &s;eeing a white man, and to this cau&s;e it was he attributed his retiring, when I turned round. Such, however, was
<PB N="38" REF="032239_0037_0FF19E9202CBE588">the fact; for when I kept advancing and <HI>Hur|dee</HI> remained a few paces behind, the animal &s;emed to redouble his pace forward till I turned round, and he then retreated with equal precipitation.</P>
<P>My companion &s;ugge&s;ted a fear that he might climb a tree and &s;pring upon us, as he &s;aid it was a common practice with tho&s;e animals; and being obliged &s;till to travel through the woods to avoid di&s;covery by the natives, it was no le&s;s dangerous for us to fire our guns. <HI>Hurdee</HI> feared capture, as he &s;aid he &s;hould certainly be de&s;troyed, if taken, and that I &s;hould be kept at lea&s;t a con&s;iderable time a captive, perhaps till ran&s;omed. Night approaching with this choice of difficulties, we re&s;olved to retire into a thick rece&s;s, and there keep large fires burning all night; to &s;leep and watch by turns.</P>
<P>Having cho&s;en our lodgment and kindled our fires we &s;upped as u&s;ual; I determined
<PB N="39" REF="032239_0038_0FF19E9395372AE8">to keep the fir&s;t watch; <HI>Hurdee</HI> had lain down to &s;leep, and I was parading clo&s;e to the fire, when <HI>Hurdee,</HI> who had heard the &s;ound of &s;teps on the ground &s;uddenly &s;tarted up and ran to his gun: I directed him not to fire but at my order, and &s;hould I fire, not to di&s;charge his piece, till I &s;hould have loaded. We could hear the trampling of a &s;oft foot, and the ru&s;tling of the bu&s;hes clo&s;e on our left, but could not determine whether it proceeded from man or bea&s;t. We were &s;oon &s;atisfied however that it was our morning vi&s;itor, whom we could &s;ee cro&s;&s;ing and recro&s;&s;ing an opening in our front where the fire was low: we therefore renew|ed our fire, and threw &s;everal pieces of the lighting wood in the track of the animal, who we found retreated &s;norting, and grow|ling. Finding our&s;elves thus &s;ucce&s;sful, we kept our fires alternately well lighted, and obtained a troubled &s;leep, but &s;ufficient for a moderate refre&s;hment.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="032239_0039_0FF19E982155FF20">
In the morning we pur&s;ued our route rather to the ea&s;tward, the mountain &s;ide bending off in that direction. The morning &s;un &s;hined extremely hot through the thick|ets, and we could di&s;cern a variety of wild animals, &s;uch as I had never &s;een before; the monkeys were very numerous, and &s;eve|ral leopards beautifully &s;potted, pa&s;&s;ed us affrighted, mo&s;tly in pairs.</P>
<P>About noon we had gained higher ground, the woods grew thinner, and we had an occa|&s;ional pro&s;pect of an open, but mountainous tract of country, extremely romantic, but dreary in the di&s;tant appearance. We loit|tered through the heat of the day in a &s;hady ravine or glen, worn through rocks and &s;ands by &s;treams from &s;prings in the bo&s;om of the mountain; here we enjoyed the plea&s;ure of bathing, and an agreeable repa&s;t of wild fruits.</P>
<P>The cour&s;e that we had hitherto pur&s;ued was tedious, and though not de&s;titute of
<PB N="41" REF="032239_0040_0FF19E9B1D02C5E8">plea&s;ures was fatiguing and attended with danger. We had calculated the di&s;tance we had come as well as we could, and concluded that we mu&s;t be not far from the <HI>little Congo</HI> river; we determined to follow the cour&s;e of the ravine, to the place into which the water di&s;charges it&s;elf; often were we on the verge of retracing the path we had come up to the &s;ummit, the fatigue was &s;o exce&s;&s;ive, and the heat reflected from the rocks and a chalky loam on the &s;ides of the ravine be|came intolerable; it became nece&s;&s;ary to take up our nights re&s;t in this glen, where we re&s;ted well but with our fires as u&s;ual.</P>
<P>Early in the morning we pur&s;ued our route downwards: the de&s;cent became le&s;s &s;teep, and the water accumulating, gradually formed a deep rivulet. About 10 o'clock, we had the &s;atisfaction of &s;eeing the winding of a beautiful little river, flowing with gentlene&s;s along the &s;kirts of the hills. We concluded it mu&s;t fall into the <HI>Congo,</HI> and accordingly re&s;olved to con&s;truct a raft to
<PB N="42" REF="032239_0041_0FF19E9F81BBD900">cro&s;s. After &s;ome labour we effected our purpo&s;e, and gained the oppo&s;ite bank about eight miles down. Here we could perceive the track of human feet: we, in con&s;e|quence, determined to change our cour&s;e directly S. E. though the champaign lands, and to keep the &s;hade, which was but light, con&s;i&s;ting of trees thinly &s;cattered and of &s;lender growth, inter&s;per&s;ed with a tree like the wild date, and the palm tree in great variety. About 5 o'clock, when we had walked about an hour and a half after din|ner, we came unexpectedly upon a town of the natives. The huts &s;tood &s;cattered irre|gularly in our front, and the appearance of fallow land &s;tretched off contiguous to them on the right and rear. Fortunately, the village was de&s;erted, but we could ob&s;erve on an open elevation the &s;moke of dome&s;tic fires at the du&s;k of evening, a con&s;iderable way to the ea&s;tward. We were obliged once more, with reluctance, to &s;eek the woods to the &s;outhward of us; and encamped that night amid the horrors of the de&s;art,
<PB N="43" REF="032239_0042_0FF19EA2838B1AC0">the roaring of the tyger, and other bea&s;ts that haunt the neighbourhood of the inno|cent &s;avage.</P>
<P>We &s;lept none this night!&mdash;Its horrors are &s;till awake in my memory, and I &s;hudder when I recall them!&mdash;Our fires appeared &s;carcely &s;ufficient for our protection. We heard the &s;tep of the heavy breathing tyger, his horrid, broken, panting a&s;piration: this, with the thrilling &s;creams of the <HI>jackall,</HI> the yell of the wild dog, and the ru&s;tling of the leaves and branches, on &s;everal &s;ides, kept us in a &s;tate of terror that cannot be conceived, but by tho&s;e have experienced &s;uch &s;ituations, and &s;een the glaring eyes of the mo&s;t fero|cious animals rolling within a few paces, and ready to pounce upon and tear the trembling victim to a thou&s;and pieces.</P>
<P>Thinking it be&s;t, when day joyfully broke in upon us, to quit this neighbourhood, where the vacated village already pointed out a warning that we had neglected, of the
<PB N="44" REF="032239_0043_0FF19EA57B5BF410">dangerous cour&s;e we were pur&s;uing; we determined to prefer the ri&s;que of expo&s;ure to our own &s;pecies, than to the mon&s;ters of the wood, and again bent our cour&s;e to the ea&s;tward. About 11 o'clock, we were &s;ur|pri&s;ed by two of the natives, armed with bows and arrows, apparently hunting. A half &s;cream expre&s;&s;ed the fir&s;t emotions of their &s;urprize; our confu&s;ion was no le&s;s extreme, perhaps it was more &s;o. They retired &s;oftly to &s;ome di&s;tance, and immedi|ately ran away with infinite &s;peed, and we &s;oon lo&s;t &s;ight of them.</P>
<P>My perturbation may be conceived. I revolved pa&s;t, pre&s;ent, and future, with the rapid glance of regret and apprehen&s;ion:&mdash;<HI>Hurdee,</HI> too, was lo&s;t in reflection; but &s;oon collected him&s;elf, and endeavoured to cheer me. We lamented that we had not kept the margin of the great river, where our dangers could not have been greater than they now were; and that our journey could not be many days longer. I &s;aw the ab&s;ur|dity
<PB N="45" REF="032239_0044_0FF19EA89830A468">of this after-wi&s;dom; but it tended to rou&s;e me. <HI>Hurdee</HI> could not di&s;tingui&s;h of what nation they were: he &s;uppo&s;ed they might be of the <HI>Ebo</HI> country, but they al&s;o re&s;embled natives of the <HI>Galla,</HI> from which we could not be very di&s;tant. If they were of the former, we might deem our&s;elves &s;ecure; if the latter, there was &s;ome danger: we concluded it to be &s;afe&s;t to get out of their way. <HI>Hurdee</HI> &s;ugge&s;ted that their &s;urprize was principally excited by the &s;ight of a white man; and that curiou&s;ity, as well as other motives, might tempt them to follow us with a large body of men. We made for the adjacent hills, and as we a&s;cended them, could ob&s;erve a numerous body of the natives pur&s;uing the cour&s;e we had taken: we accordingly changed our cour&s;e from the S. E. to the N. E. and rather ran than walked.</P>
<P>We had to cro&s;s a mountain, and after labouring to its &s;ummit, we became expo&s;ed from the want of cover, there being little
<PB N="46" REF="032239_0045_0FF19EAD02A283C8">el&s;e of vegetation but a light herbage and bru&s;h wood. We viewed them from an elevated ground as they cro&s;&s;ed open patches, and then crept on our hands and knees, and crouched behind clu&s;ters of the thicket to prevent di&s;covery.</P>
<P>From the different views we had of them, we e&s;timated them at about three hundred in number: they were armed with clubs, lances, bows and arrows, and kept their u&s;ual order of battle in a very compact body. <HI>Hurdee</HI> now &s;eemed &s;atisfied that they were of the <HI>Galla</HI> nation, and he was certain we mu&s;t be the objects of their pur&s;uit.</P>
<P>We re&s;olved to keep them in view, and watch till they &s;hould encamp, when we might take advantage of the night to counter|march them: we did &s;o, and embraced the cover of the night to return to our former cour&s;e direct to the ea&s;tward.</P>

This whole night we travelled without cea&s;ing, under con&s;tant alarm from the roar|ing of wild bea&s;ts. The night was exce&s;&s;ive dark, and we could not di&s;cern any objects at a great di&s;tance. I drew the charge from one of my pi&s;tols, and when we heard a ru&s;tling among the bu&s;hes near us, burned priming, as the only expedient we could devi&s;e be&s;ide firing &s;hot, which we would not do, le&s;t we &s;hould alarm our pur&s;uers.</P>
<P>About day break my companion trod upon a &s;mall green &s;nake, which bit his right leg clo&s;e to the outer ankle. I was much alarmed; but he very coolly took &s;ome of the root out of his pouch, and chewing it as the good old African had before done; the juice of the root was white like milk, but on applying it to the wound it changed to a yellow, di&s;agreeable colour: having repeatedly applied it, until the juice was no longer di&s;coloured, he tied a bandage round it, and we pur&s;ued our route, happy that he had e&s;caped &s;o well.</P>

This root I have repeatedly &s;een; but from a neglect of concerns le&s;s important for the time, I unfortunately did not bring it with me.

This, it is probable, acted by the volat. alk. which is its chief ingredient, neutralizing the virulence of the poi&s;on.&mdash;Might not the vegetable alkaline principle exi&s;t in the juice of our antidote above in a &s;tate either detached or ea&s;ily &s;eparable, &s;o as to neutralize the matter of poi&s;on in a &s;imilar manner? This is merely conjecture, but may be well worthy the further attention of medical men; for if found ju&s;t, nothing more will be found nece&s;&s;ary to cure the bite of a &s;nake, than the application of a little pot-a&s;h.</NOTE>.</P>

Hunger, which we had di&s;regarded in the moments of terror, now came on with the utmo&s;t force; and our dried beef and other provi&s;ions growing &s;hort, it was nece&s;&s;ary that we &s;hould &s;eek for &s;ome fre&s;h provi&s;ions.

He accordingly let fly at the fir&s;t animal we met, and it fell, we could find no wound but a &s;light one in the leg. We collected wood, made a fire, and were about to dre&s;s our prey, when lo! it di&s;appeared. We were about to go in &s;earch of &s;ome other animal, when we found it ru&s;tling in the bu&s;hes, and &s;oon retook it. In &s;hape and colour it re&s;embled the <HI>Opo&s;&s;um,</HI> except that it had no pouch or fal&s;e belly; the hair al&s;o was much &s;horter&mdash;However, when dre&s;&s;ed, it ta&s;ted deliciou&s;ly; and after breakfa&s;t, for the fir&s;t time, we lay down to &s;leep.</P>
<P>We awoke about 10 o'clock, tolerably refre&s;hed; and having yet to pa&s;s a moun|tain which we hoped would be the la&s;t, we judged it prudent to keep on the verge of the woods, between that and the top of the a&s;cent. About 4 o'clock we di&s;covered fires at a di&s;tance, and ve&s;tiges of population in the pathways which inter&s;ected each other, and appeared newly trodden. The appear|ances of population to the northward were
<PB N="51" REF="032239_0050_0FF19EBA6229D598">very di&s;tingui&s;hable; and therefore, appre|hending that we approached &s;ome of tho&s;e numerous nations, that con&s;tantly inhabit the luxurious countries in the neighbourhood of the <HI>Congo</HI> River near its &s;ources, and the charming vallies at the feet of the <HI>Galla</HI> moun|tains on the &s;outh and ea&s;tern &s;ides; we determined to be circum&s;pect, and proceed by ea&s;y journies to avoid falling into the hands of either of them.</P>
<P>Night was approaching fa&s;t, we had de&s;cended the mountain towards the E. &s;ome|what &s;outhwardly, and the &s;un was already hidden from us by the heights we had pa&s;&s;ed, which threw their &s;hadows over the beau|tiful vallies that we could ju&s;t di&s;tingui&s;h, expanded to a boundle&s;s di&s;tance before us. We determined to proceed &s;lowly towards the low country, and repo&s;e once more &s;ecure from the terrors of the fore&s;t; to view the country the next day, and to take &s;uch &s;teps as might be mo&s;t like to en&s;ure our &s;afe
<PB N="52" REF="032239_0051_0FF19EBF154C31B8">arrival, now that we could not be remote from the place of de&s;tination.</P>
<P>A few monkies, who&s;e chattering was no longer deemed an annoyance, after our acquaintance with &s;ounds &s;o chilling and terrific, were our only di&s;turbers during the night;&mdash;we &s;lept peaceably, and ro&s;e with the dawn.</P>
<P>Having agreed to reconnoitre the country before we &s;hould proceed, we made a kind of fe&s;tival of this charming morning. We unpacked our powder, and repacked our flints, and trinkets; we cleaned our arms, and by the time we had partaken of a plen|tiful breakfa&s;t, the &s;ides of the green hills and plains beneath us, were di&s;clo&s;ed to our view by the opening &s;un, in a &s;tyle of verdure and beauty truly delighting. The light &s;hades of the &s;loping hill on the north|ea&s;tern a&s;pect, contra&s;ted by the du&s;ky hue of the valleys on the &s;outhern and we&s;tern
<PB N="53" REF="032239_0052_0FF19EC0E35C1020">&s;ides; and the irregularity of the &s;hades ca&s;t by the profile of the more elevated hills, on the plains &s;cattered through the winding vallies, gradually de&s;cending, and the whole pro&s;pect vividly brightning without mi&s;t or cloud in the horizon, altogether exhibited, a &s;cene of &s;erene grandeur that warmed my heart and made me almo&s;t forget the incon|veniences I had &s;u&s;tained.</P>
<P>The country was thickly peopled, the marks of cultivation were vi&s;ible on the &s;ides of the declining plains, and on the level; but no river could be &s;een. We con&s;idered it however, as at no great di&s;tance, and re&s;olved to pa&s;s the day as a time of re&s;t, and to pur&s;ue our journey under the protection of night to avoid di&s;covery, until we &s;hould judge that we had gained the country of the <HI>Ebo</HI> King.</P>
<P>After a plea&s;ant dinner we went to repo&s;e preparatory for the nights travel, we awoke about &s;un-&s;et, immediately de&s;cended to the
<PB N="54" REF="032239_0053_0FF19EC3D528C368">valley, and &s;et forward; we continued this cour&s;e for four nights, frequently meeting with &s;ettlements, and changing our cour&s;e thro' the neare&s;t woods to avoid the haunts of men; living upon cold provi&s;ions, or the fruits which we gathered in abundance as we pa&s;&s;ed along.</P>
<P>The country we had now gained was once more apparently very fertile and watered with little rivulets, which promi&s;ed us the plea&s;ure of &s;peedily gaining the banks of that river, for which we had long looked with aching eyes. On the morning of the fifth day before &s;un-ri&s;e, we reached the bank, and were fortunate enough to find means to pa&s;s it without difficulty or danger; now we con&s;idered our&s;elves, as the mariner after a long voyage, arrived at the de&s;tined port.</P>
<P>The paths from the river were now no longer objects to be &s;hunned, we pur&s;ued
<PB N="55" REF="032239_0054_0FF19EC991376CC8">that which appeared to be the greate&s;t; and about 9 o'clock we entered a hand&s;ome village.</P>
<P>Our appearance alarmed the inhabitants, who fled from their huts, and collected in con&s;iderable numbers, with their &s;imple arms in their hands. <HI>Hurdee,</HI> who&s;e countenance lighted up with plea&s;ure, &s;eeing they were friends, gave his gun to me, and made the u&s;ual &s;ignal of peace, by &s;heathing his arrows and hanging his bow over his &s;houlders. They then approached near us, and he delivered to them his bow and knife, telling them we were on our way from the <HI>Congo</HI> to the <HI>Ebo</HI> King to trade, on which they returned his knife and bow, and told him we were wel|come, and &s;hould be well received.</P>
<P>I propo&s;ed delivering my arms likewi&s;e, but <HI>Hurdee</HI> advi&s;ed me not, thinking that as they were very &s;carce in that country, and con&s;equently highly valuable, they might be prompted to detain them.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="032239_0055_0FF19ECB2182CFC8">
The ea&s;e and good humor with which we were received was to me mo&s;t con&s;olitary, and I took it to be a mo&s;t flattering pre&s;age of the &s;ucce&s;s to attend our laborious and dangerous enterprize. We were conducted into one of their hou&s;es, or huts, compo&s;ed of &s;light timbers or branches &s;unk in the earth, or in an artificial bank of earth rai&s;ed about a foot above the ordinary level of the &s;cite of the village. The tops of the huts are round, or dome like, formed very rudely into that &s;hape, by bending the tops of the branches toward the centre, and there tying them with &s;lender &s;aplings to each other. The broad and fan-like branches of the palm and date tree, tied by their &s;tems on the out&s;ide, and the points downward, form their covering or thatch. Repeated layers of the&s;e materials, and the &s;kins of animals, are further u&s;ed to defend the&s;e humble habitations from the mo&s;t &s;evere rains; and as the dome&s;tic offices of cookery, and their rude handicraft works are performed in the open air, or in the &s;hade of branching trees,
<PB N="57" REF="032239_0056_0FF19ED11B255740">which here are never di&s;robed of their foliage, their &s;mall dwellings are not incommoded by this &s;ort of family bu&s;ine&s;s. The in&s;ects &s;o trouble&s;ome in warm countries, e&s;pecially adjacent to woods or low grounds, are kept aloof by the inartificial expedient of a thick &s;moke produced by fires kept con&s;tantly light|ed, and compo&s;ed of the dung of their cattle, or a compo&s;ition of leaves of trees or reeds and rotted timber kept in a &s;tate of moi&s;ture.</P>
<P>The&s;e artificial clouds had not yet di&s;&s;ipated in my new habitation, and the effect on my eyes was con&s;iderably painful: through my friend <HI>Hurdee</HI> care was taken to ea&s;e me on that head, and a repa&s;t was &s;oon &s;erved up, of which we partook with minds and appe|tites that converted the habitation of the &s;avage into a palace, and gave a reli&s;h to the food equal to that enjoyed by the luxu|rious. Seated on the floor, on &s;kins and mats &s;pread for us, we fea&s;ted on fre&s;h beef and ears of maize roa&s;ted, and for our de&s;&s;ert
<PB N="58" REF="032239_0057_0FF19ED40ADA59D0">on the fine&s;t <HI>bannanas:</HI> our drink was new milk and palm wine.</P>
<P>The people had caught the information, on all &s;ides, of the arrival of one of tho&s;e extraordinary animals a white man, and all thronged, eager as it appeared to di&s;cover whether it re&s;embled the men or the monkies of their own country; for &s;uch it appeared were the compari&s;ons they made, and in a manner, as I afterwards under&s;tood, no wi&s;e flattering to the pride of a fair &s;kin.</P>
<P>The women appear among the Africans to be endowed with the &s;exual attribute of curio&s;ity, in common with tho&s;e of all other colours and countries: they thronged foremo&s;t around me, and &s;o crowded that I found it nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;ake of air, and to gratify curio&s;ity at once, to walk abroad. The children looked with wonder, and the women according to their age or temper tittered, roared out in laughter, or cla&s;ped their hands,
<PB N="59" REF="032239_0058_0FF19ED6FA2FF730">as they were each affected. Some opened my hair, others examined my jacket and trow&s;ers; my &s;leeve buttons amu&s;ed one, and the frill of my &s;hirt another; my hair, which had by their curio&s;ity or accident become loo&s;e, was the object of admiration to all.</P>
<P>Their familiarity &s;urpri&s;ed me for a time; but reflecting that it mu&s;t be the natural con&s;equence of innocent curio&s;ity excited by novelty, I returned their freedom with good humour, and &s;ound that they were plea&s;ed with my manner of treating them.</P>
<P>Fatigued with the previous travel, and tired with trifling, I &s;ignified to <HI>Hurdee</HI> my wi&s;h of retiring to re&s;t: he accordingly informed the villagers, and we were &s;oon left alone. After this we partook of a &s;econd repa&s;t con&s;i&s;ting of boiled rice, mutton, and palm wine, and agreeing to &s;et out for the re&s;idence of the <HI>Ebo</HI> king on the
<PB N="60" REF="032239_0059_0FF19EDA01CE3438">morrow, retired to a comfortable and &s;ecure repo&s;e.</P>
<P>Early in the morning we were awakened by the villagers, fifteen of whom had been appointed to e&s;cort us on our route. They were armed with lances pointed, &s;ome with bone, others with a hard burnt wood, and &s;ome with iron. They had bows and arrows, the former more than three feet long, the arrows of irregular lengths, from about eighteen inches to two feet, coar&s;ely barbed.</P>
<P>After a &s;light refre&s;hment of fruit and palm wine, we proceeded to the &s;outhward, it being about 4 o'clock in the morning. A great croud of the villagers had collected to view the prodigy once more, and many of them accompanied us, not tired of gazing, till near mid-day; when we lay by for re&s;t, and retired from the heat which was now daily encrea&s;ing.</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="032239_0060_0FF19EDE4A2221A8">
We did not reach the next village until after dark: one of our e&s;cort had preceded us about an hour, and had provided a hut much more commodious than that in which we had la&s;t lain: here we had com|fortable beds of neatly formed mats, and here marks of ingenuity were evident in a &s;pecies of wicker work on the walls, or rather partitions; refre&s;hments were pro|vided for us in like manner, without their &s;eeking for recompence of any kind.</P>
<P>We ro&s;e early as u&s;ual, but our fame was up before us with the villagers; who here and on the greater part of our cour&s;e incommoded and &s;ometimes ob&s;tructed our pa&s;&s;age by their numbers.</P>
<P>The country through which we now tra|velled was extremely picture&s;que, and the towns thickly &s;cattered di&s;played to me much more enlarged ideas of their civiliza|tion than I had before conceived. Agricul|ture &s;eemed to be carried on with much
<PB N="62" REF="032239_0061_0FF19EDFD7D71E70">indu&s;try, but not indeed with any appear|ance of regularity or &s;y&s;tem. The grounds in open places appeared &s;own with grain in detached patches, without fences or ditches. A rivulet not unfrequently bounded a piece of land newly turned up, on the other &s;ide of which was ob&s;ervable either a cop&s;e, or a field of corn advanced in growth, a &s;pace of vacant ground, or inter&s;per&s;ed with reed or &s;ugar cane, and maize. In the mid&s;t of the&s;e a &s;olitary palm tree &s;ometimes &s;tood, and a declivity, a &s;wamp, or a thick wood, broke upon the line of culture and habitation. Roads appear next, which owe nothing to art, and their exi&s;tence only to the con&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of travellers ob&s;tructing the progre&s;s of rapid vegetation when not in the &s;hade, and when beneath it, to an ab&s;ence of the &s;un's rays.</P>
<P>We reached a very populous village at the noon of the fifth day; when finding my&s;elf extremely alarmed with feveri&s;h &s;ymptoms in con&s;equence of the croud which
<PB N="63" REF="032239_0062_0FF19EE2CBAD8468">pre&s;&s;ed round me, was obliged to reque&s;t by my interpreter, that we might have a retired and &s;eparate habitation, and be &s;ecured from the intru&s;ion of the curious. My wi&s;hes were an&s;wered, and I determined to per&s;evere in the journey which now promi&s;ed to be &s;o &s;hort. The villagers procured hor&s;es for us, but without the convenience of &s;addles. In this circum&s;tance, and in a warm climate I would have preferred walking, but was per&s;uaded to accept offices dictated by &s;uch ho&s;pitable intentions, and accordingly &s;et forward. A per&s;on was di&s;patched before us to announce our arrival; we determined to repo&s;e during the heat of this day in a plea&s;ant valley de&s;cribed by the natives, and to travel in the night &s;o that we might reach our de&s;tination by the en&s;uing morning. My fever had entirely abated, and I found my&s;elf after the mid-days repo&s;e, perfectly able to ride the re&s;t of the way during the night.</P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="032239_0063_0FF19EE5BB7B7678">
We were now near our journey's end; and about 11 o'clock we had the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing our courier return accompanied by about 100 per&s;ons armed with long lances, who we were informed, compo&s;ed a part of the <HI>Ebo</HI> Kings guard, and had been &s;ent to receive us. Upon their approach, they opened on each &s;ide of us in good order, with their lances pointed downward behind, and as we pa&s;&s;ed thro' them clo&s;ed in files and followed with much regularity.</P>
<P>It was now about 2 o'clock, and we had advanced half a mile in this form, when a large body of people appeared who we were given to under&s;tand, were the principal per&s;ons of the town, di&s;patched to conduct us to the kings pre&s;ence. The roads were covered with people, &s;o as to render our progre&s;s &s;low and irk&s;ome&mdash;at length we entered the town about 4 o'clock.</P>
<P>The capital of <HI>Ebo,</HI> or <HI>Quappa Ebo,</HI> is plea&s;antly &s;ituated on the &s;ides of two hills,
<PB N="65" REF="032239_0064_0FF19EE8B0EA79E8">which are cut at an acute angle by a ca&s;cade that de&s;cends through an agreeable wood, and di&s;charges its waters in a &s;hallow pebbled rivulet that bi&s;ects the valley in the center. Tho&s;e parts of the town that occupy the &s;loping grounds, form two &s;ides of a triangle, the remaining &s;ide is formed by a river of about four hundred feet wide, into which the rivulet falls; our entrance was from the wood acro&s;s this river which we forded. The open country along the river downward was highly cultivated, and beautifully contra&s;ted in its verdure with the brown appearance of the town, which excepting the few trees here and there di&s;per&s;ed, exhibited a view of con&s;iderable population and regularity. The &s;treets were laid out with a con&s;iderable regard to order, &s;o as even to be ob&s;erved at a di&s;tance; there was not any thing of grandeur, it is true, but certainly a degree of elegant &s;implicity and neatne&s;s which I did not expect to find.</P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="032239_0065_0FF19EEBA048B988">
We were conducted to the kings hut, he received us at his door, and after &s;haking me by the hands very earne&s;tly for a minute, retired and beckoned us to follow, which we did. This hut was oblong as large as &s;ome of our barns, and divided into rooms by wicker partitions covered with neatly coloured mats, and ornamented with cane and reed ba&s;kets with other fancy works of the kind.</P>
<P>When we had reached the third apart|ment, where was a number of women already &s;eated, he &s;at down on a bench covered with a mat and holding out his hands to me &s;hook mine very earne&s;tly again. He then &s;hook <HI>Hurdee,</HI> &s;peaking to him in the Ebo language; I was then directed to &s;alute all his wives, <HI>&s;eventeen</HI> in number; I would willingly have di&s;pen&s;ed with this branch of the ceremony, but <HI>Hurdee</HI> told me with a &s;mile it was the cu&s;tom&mdash;and I accordingly, with no little
<PB N="67" REF="032239_0066_0FF19EEE9FDEB8D0">di&s;compo&s;ure of my &s;tomach, complied with all the form.</P>
<P>Having completed this bu&s;ine&s;s without &s;howing evident marks of di&s;&s;atisfaction, was handed round to the elders, or what I &s;uppo&s;e &s;ome &s;ubject of an European monarch would call the <HI>nobility.</HI> With all the&s;e I &s;hook hands in turn, and was then led to a mat placed for me nearly in the front of his <HI>&s;able</HI> maje&s;ty, with whom by means of <HI>Hurdee</HI> I entered into conver&s;ation on the &s;ubject of my mi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>He informed me that he had been made acquainted with the object of my journey, that he was plea&s;ed at my prefering him to his neighbours; that he was willing to trade with me in <HI>gold, ivory,</HI> or <HI>pri&s;oners;</HI> that he &s;hould wi&s;h to trade con&s;tantly, and to be furni&s;hed with goods from the <HI>&s;ea countries,</HI> as he called them, in abundance, for which he would pay largely. Having &s;tated my &s;atisfaction at his kindne&s;s, and my thanks
<PB N="68" REF="032239_0067_0FF19EF1AB887C48">for the attention be&s;towed by his favour on me then and while on the road, I told him it was my wi&s;h to put his propo&s;als into practice by keeping the trade open con&s;tantly and &s;upplying it abundantly. He then entered on general conver&s;ation, enquiring into the manners, cu&s;toms, and &s;ituation of my country, of which he appeared to have already had &s;ome accounts. He related &s;ome particulars concerning him&s;elf and the people of <HI>Ebo,</HI> his wars with &s;ome neighbouring people and frequently enlivened his &s;pirits and our conver&s;ation with draughts of excel|lent palm wine.</P>
<P>We continued thus, partaking occa&s;ionally of pine apples and other fruit, till du&s;k, when a large fire being lighted, a banquet of roa&s;ted veni&s;on, &s;ome birds, and milk, with rice, was &s;erved to us as we &s;at. He aro&s;e and beckoning to a woman on his left, &s;ix others were called in, who were pre|&s;ented to me and offered as wives. This piece of politene&s;s and ho&s;pitality I endea|voured
<PB N="69" REF="032239_0068_0FF19EF5F6C37090">to decline, <HI>Hurdee</HI> had previou&s;ly apprized me of this cu&s;tom, but I conceived that my informing them that I was already a married man would relea&s;e me from this dilemma; I was di&s;appointed; the king femed &s;urpri&s;ed at the nature of my objection, and in&s;tanced him&s;elf who was al&s;o married but yet took other wives. Finding my&s;elf in this <HI>delicate</HI> predicament, and deriving no re&s;ource from the advice of my interpreter, I re&s;olved to accommodate my&s;elf to my &s;ituation with as good a grace as po&s;&s;ible. Judging one wife &s;ufficient for any rea&s;on|able man; I re&s;olved not to be burthened with &s;ix; but thinking that I mu&s;t in &s;ome degree &s;acrifice to cu&s;tom I re&s;olved to chu&s;e <HI>two</HI>&mdash;and with the&s;e I was directly conducted to a hand&s;ome, but newly built apartment near what I mu&s;t, <HI>for the honour of the thing,</HI> call the palace!</P>
<P>My re&s;idence con&s;i&s;ted of a long open building like a piazza, without any &s;ide covering; within this was a long cro&s;s room
<PB N="70" REF="032239_0069_0FF19EF786F1E4A0">divivided into two by a partition; and in the rear another room the floor of which was a few inches higher than that of the outer apart|ment. Lamps, (if I may &s;o call &s;mall earthen mi&s;hapen cups with <HI>cocoanut</HI> oil,) darkly illu|minated the&s;e appartments;&mdash;the outer was covered with ordinary mats, the inner with one neatly woven and of various colours, with ru&s;hes and palm tree fibres, At one end of this appartment was half &s;pread a large kind of mattra&s;s made of cotton, thin but not uncomfortable; and here it was that for the fir&s;t time in my life, I was to repo&s;e with the du&s;ky daughters of Africa.</P>
<P>Readers of different humours will view this &s;cene with varied &s;entiments;&mdash;the jocu|lar will anticipate the embarra&s;&s;ment of a qualmi&s;h youth, &s;hoved into a neat hovel with a tall &s;lender and comely but &s;edate African girl who &s;at half averted from me in the part of the room mo&s;t remote from the door and the place of repo&s;e, while another plumy, middle &s;ized wench &s;tood laughing
<PB N="71" REF="032239_0070_0FF19EF9169BC010">and giggling, by turns looking at me and then at her female partner, as if anxious to deter|mine which &s;hould enter upon, or avoid&mdash;conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>I could not for a time determine whether to lie down in my clothes or undre&s;s&mdash;I really forgot every thing but the aukwardne&s;s of my &s;ituation.&mdash;The lamps, however, had fortunately nearly con&s;umed their oil, and I took advantage of the glimmer, to di&s;po&s;e of my apparel, and lay down&mdash;like many a fond hu&s;band&mdash;with my face averted from my Ebon companions, who contrived to approach and partake with me of the mat|tra&s;s, and with it as I infer from my own experience, of a plea&s;ant repo&s;e.</P>
<P>When morning appeared, a wicker woven aperture admitted the light, and di&s;covered to me my two wives (for &s;o I mu&s;t hencefor|ward call them) wrapped in the arms&mdash;of &s;leep;&mdash;one at each &s;ide of me; but at a re&s;pectful di&s;tance. I lay a while reflecting

<P>I could not &s;peak a word of their language, and we were thus lying compo&s;ed in &s;ilence, when <HI>Hurdee</HI> announced a vi&s;itor. I &s;allied forth without the ceremonial of a bow, or a farewel; and found the old Chieftain was waiting for me. He propo&s;ed a walk after I &s;hould have refre&s;hed my&s;elf; we accord|ingly &s;at down to breakfa&s;t, and I was joined by my wives, as we were about to proceed on our little tour; I was &s;hewn the greater part of the town; we a&s;cended the hill to the &s;outh we&s;tward, and the old man explained to me by means of <HI>Hurdee,</HI> every particular that he thought worthy of notice, or that I a&s;ked.</P>

The town con&s;i&s;ts of about 1200 hou&s;es, laid out into very regular &s;treets, not &s;o much the effect of a previous plan, as of the judicious arrangements taken to prevent any dwelling encroaching on the line of a &s;treet. The we&s;tern &s;ide of the &s;hallow rivulet that pa&s;&s;es through the town was fir&s;t planned, and laid out in one great &s;treet along its margin, not following its irregu|larities, but pre&s;enting a &s;trait front. On the oppo&s;ite &s;ide, the &s;ame &s;y&s;tem was pur&s;ued, but the &s;treets, diverging from the&s;e to the feet of the hills, were wider on one &s;ide than the other; they terminated each in a large &s;treet at the feet of each hill, beyond which were gardens or maize ground, orchards, or walks of orange or citron trees, with &s;ome of the date and cocoanut&mdash;here was likewi&s;e to be &s;een the &s;ugar cane, and the fine&s;t maize I had ever beheld, and the tree from which the <HI>ca&s;&s;ava</HI> is procured, with a con&s;iderable quantity of large &s;pecies of millet, the broom, or guiney corn. The whole town formed almo&s;t a regular triangle;
<PB N="74" REF="032239_0073_0FF19F03793B8CE0" MS="y">the little rivulet divided it into two irregular triangles, owing to diverging more one &s;ide than the other; the other &s;treets were &s;trait, but at unequal di&s;tances.</P>
<P>I have before in &s;ome degree de&s;cribed&punc; the hou&s;es of the natives: I had now an opportunity of hearing the proce&s;s of their building art de&s;cribed, and witne&s;&s;ing the truth of the de&s;cription.</P>
<P>When they purpo&s;e building a hou&s;e, they fir&s;t determine upon the form and extent of it, by fixing &s;takes and making a large bank of earth within the line, either circular, &s;emicircular, oblong or &s;quare, for they have hou&s;es of all the&s;e forms:&mdash;this earth or clay being well tempered and mixed with &s;and, is beat down and &s;moothed with an inclination of the plane to the door. They leave it expo&s;ed to the heat of the &s;un, which is here very con&s;iderable, for &s;ome days before they proceed further. When they find it &s;ufficiently hard, the frame is
<PB N="75" REF="032239_0074_0FF19F07CFAAECE0">rai&s;ed, roughly as may be &s;uppo&s;ed, and connected by ropes of the cocoa bark, or dry|ed canes, or the withes or &s;aplings of young trees. When they have fixed timbers round the cornice or eaves, if I may &s;o call it, they elevate two long &s;lender timbers at each end of the building. The&s;e they tie firmly at the corners, when the hou&s;e is angular, and again at the elevated points where they meet, longer timbers are rai&s;ed about the middle, and what may be called a ridge pole, con&s;i&s;ting of one &s;lender timber, firmly la&s;hed above throughout the whole length. Light branches are now laid on, and the whole is covered over like the round huts, with the leaves or bark of trees, &amp;c. This &s;pecies of building may be con&s;idered &s;ump|tuous, and is rare; the &s;tructure of the round buildings requires le&s;s labour and combination. When the roof is covered, they proceed to fill up the &s;paces between the corner po&s;ts in the &s;ides and ends: for this they drive &s;takes in regular order, leaving fit openings by their inter&s;ections for
<PB N="76" REF="032239_0075_0FF19F095DD68108">doors or windows. The&s;e la&s;t are very narrow and numerous, admitting a con&s;tant draught of air, and capable of being ea&s;ily clo&s;ed: cane works formed with much inge|nuity, ornament the in&s;ide. When the walls are thus far compleated, the out&s;ide plai&s;tered with clay well kneaded, which being &s;moothed, really has a hand&s;ome appearance, but &s;uffers upon the fall of heavy rains, again&s;t which every hou&s;e is provided with a deep ditch, leading all round to carry off the water as it falls. Each dwelling is &s;eparated from the other by a &s;mall yard, marked by a fence or &s;tockade of po&s;ts, of four to &s;ix inches diameter.</P>
<P>The king's hou&s;e alone was unencumbered by a clo&s;e neighbourhood, having a greater &s;pace of yard in front. It had eight rooms, but was in reality, two hou&s;es united: a hand&s;ome gra&s;s plot, &s;haded by about ten or twelve lofty trees lay behind, and through this a path &s;trewed with a brown and yellow
<PB N="77" REF="032239_0076_0FF19F0C6E0F7D18">glittering &s;and, led winding to the &s;ummit of the hill, where was a neat hut erected with only a light roof, and &s;ides compo&s;ed of mats that admitted of being rai&s;ed or let down at plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>Before we had arrived at this place, I took care to &s;end <HI>Hurdee</HI> for a few articles that I purpo&s;ed pre&s;enting to the king; and when we &s;at to re&s;t, after a&s;cending to this beautiful eminence, I took an oppor|tunity of pre&s;enting to him, a hand&s;ome ornamented cla&s;p knife, a &s;mall oval looking-gla&s;s, &s;ome bra&s;s rings for bracelets, and a pair of ordinary pa&s;te &s;leeve buttons, with red tin&s;el and a gilt knot in them. The old man was highly delighted, and did not &s;peak for &s;everal minutes, being &s;o much engaged in admiring his riches. He at la&s;t broke out into expre&s;&s;ions of thanks, and propo&s;ed &s;hew|ing me where he had lately fought a great battle with the <HI>Galla</HI> king, who had invaded his kingdom, attempted to carry off his people, and reduce the country to be under his own government.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="032239_0077_0FF19F0F5F8584E0">
We proceeded along the we&s;tern &s;ide of the hill, about three miles, pa&s;&s;ing by a &s;ine cultivated country, and large fields of corn. Huts were &s;cattered here and there along our cour&s;e, and goats and &s;heep grazed on the rich pa&s;tures as far as the eye could reach. We now de&s;cended through a wood, and entered a large plain: on our way to this place, he related the cau&s;e of the inva&s;ion to have ari&s;en from the following adventure.</P>
<P>A party of hunters from one of the remote towns of the <HI>Ebo</HI> country, had pur&s;ued their game beyond what the <HI>Galla</HI> king con&s;idered his boundary, and were met by a party of the latter people, likewi&s;e hunting. They now commenced a pur&s;uit of the game, that had been nearly run down by the <HI>Ebo</HI> people, but were not &s;ucce&s;sful, for one of the <HI>Ebo</HI> hunters, brought it down with his &s;pear. The <HI>Galla</HI> hunters &s;ought to appropriate it to them&s;elves; a fray en&s;ued, one of the <HI>Galla</HI> people was killed, the re&s;t put to flight, and the game brought off in triumph though
<PB N="79" REF="032239_0078_0FF19F125F362C60">&s;everal of the <HI>Ebo</HI> people were wounded &s;everely.</P>
<P>Both parties were highly enraged; the <HI>Galla</HI> king rai&s;ed an army, invaded the country, burned two villages, carried off &s;ome cattle, and a few pri&s;oners, which he &s;old for &s;laves. The <HI>Ebo</HI> people were terrified with the fir&s;t &s;ucce&s;&s;es of the enemy: they alloted a con&s;iderable force to oppo&s;e them; &s;everal actions were fought, but the <HI>Ebo</HI> king was &s;o much the &s;ufferer in each, that his army was nearly de&s;troyed. The <HI>Galla</HI> king encouraged by the&s;e &s;ucce&s;&s;es, and relying too much on the weakne&s;s of the <HI>Ebo</HI> people formed the re&s;olution of &s;ubju|gating the whole country to his rule. For this purpo&s;e he collected all his force, and &s;preading de&s;olation as he pa&s;&s;ed, cro&s;&s;ed the great &s;wamp to the N. W. in order to avoid the circuit of the upper lands, and had already approached within the di&s;tance of three miles from the capital, where all the
<PB N="80" REF="032239_0079_0FF19F1556649AE0">fugitives from the de&s;olated towns, had taken refuge.</P>
<P>The city could be approached only by a narrow defile, through which the river pa&s;&s;ed, leaving a road on that &s;ide next the city; or be attempting the road over the hills and through the woods, by which we had entered. The <HI>Galla</HI> chief preferred the former: a party of the <HI>Ebo</HI> people who had e&s;caped from bondage, communicated the de&s;ign; that the old <HI>Ebo</HI> chief took his mea&s;ures accordingly. He collected a body of 200 picked men, &s;upported by a body of 300 <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word">, to guard the pa&s;s on the &s;ide next to the enemy. Over the&s;e as the re&s;erve, he appointed his elde&s;t &s;on, and his own bro|ther; the re&s;t of his army he led him&s;elf, in two divi&s;ions: his &s;econd &s;on heading the left, in which his principal wives<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The &s;tout young women engage in mo&s;t of the expeditions throughout the whole country; this being an extraordinary occa&s;ion, and utter ruin or conque&s;t being the only alternative&mdash;the young boys and girls, followed their parents to this action, and contributed by their pre&s;ence, to render it deci&s;ive</NOTE> and their brothers, were di&s;tributed.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="032239_0080_0FF19F19A5E4C288">
The king &s;hewed me the &s;pot where he took his &s;tation; it was an elevated &s;pot of ground, covered with large &s;hady trees, inacce&s;&s;ible in the front; but overlooking the whole plain below, with which it communicated by two paths at &s;ome di&s;tance to the right and left. A path was opened, and a line of men &s;tretched along the top of the hill, to the edge of this pa&s;s, to which he paid con&s;tant attention.</P>
<P>The <HI>Galla</HI> people attempted to march before &s;un ri&s;e, but a large fire &s;uddenly appearing on their right, at the di&s;tance of about half a mile, occa&s;ioned them to halt: it cea&s;ed in a few minutes, but had the effect of di&s;piriting the <HI>Galla</HI> people; who marched on however, about an hour after. They advanced rapidly, and &s;oon de&s;cried
<PB N="82" REF="032239_0081_0FF19F1B33884E78">the troops under the kings elde&s;t &s;on, ready to receive them: the <HI>Galla</HI> people began the attack by a di&s;charge of arrows, which was returned by the <HI>Ebo</HI> party; and followed by a &s;econd flight before the <HI>Galla</HI> army expected it. The <HI>Galla</HI> warriors then bran|di&s;hed their lances, clo&s;ed their ranks, and made a vigorous attack on the kings army, who being unprepared, threw by their bows, and clo&s;ed in a compact body to receive them with their &s;pears: this oppo&s;ition was &s;hort, for the <HI>Ebo</HI> party fled into the narrow part of the pa&s;s, as if panic &s;truck, the <HI>Galla</HI> people pur&s;uing them. The two parties of the <HI>Ebo</HI> army now rallied on the inner &s;ide of a &s;loping ground; and as &s;he <HI>Galla</HI> people crouded through the pa&s;s to pur&s;ue them, the old Chief &s;allied from his rece&s;s, and commenced the attack in the rear. The battle was now carried on with the greate&s;t vigour on both &s;ides. The <HI>Ebo</HI> army being &s;en&s;ible that this was their la&s;t and only hope, fought with de&s;paration; while the <HI>Galla</HI> troops no le&s;s in&s;tigated by the

The &s;laughter was terrible for a con&s;iderable time; the <HI>Galla</HI> people, however, at la&s;t gave way, and fled in immen&s;e numbers to the river, among the foremo&s;t of whom was their chief. He, however, rallied his troops on the plain, in front of their camp. The numbers killed already, exceeding that of the <HI>Ebo</HI> army; what remained was &s;till as numerous. The old <HI>Ebo</HI> chief determined to pur&s;ue his &s;ucce&s;s, while his people were elated, and marched into the plain, fate as yet &s;eeming to hold the balances of victory.</P>
<P>The attack was made by the elde&s;t &s;on, but he was met with &s;uch warmth and intrepidity by the enemy, that his ranks gave way. He called aloud to them, and drawing a circle round him with his &s;word, declared, he never would quit the &s;pot, but with victory. The people rou&s;ed by his bravery, returned to the charge, but before they could re&s;cue him, he fell, covered with
<PB N="84" REF="032239_0083_0FF19F1E59B9AD98">wounds, and run through by lances. When his younger brother appeared, having carried all before him on the left, a more de&s;perate action en&s;ued; the &s;houting of women and children, enlivened the <HI>Ebo</HI> people, when the arrival of the old chief and his brother with their divi&s;ions, decided the victory in their favour.&mdash;The enemy fought with de&s;paration, but the old chief having attacked them in the rear, no hope remained, and they who did not prefer death, were made captives. 700 were taken pri&s;oners, tho&s;e who had remained in the <HI>Galla</HI> camp to guard again&s;t &s;urprize, took to flight; num|bers of them were taken by the women and &s;cattered inhabitants, who pur&s;ued them for two days. The king, with but few followers, effected his e&s;cape with much difficulty, while mo&s;t of the principal warriors were among the captives.</P>
<P>The <HI>Ebo</HI> king lo&s;t, be&s;ide his elde&s;t &s;on, his brother, who fell in the conflict, and three of his wives. The old man conducted
<PB N="85" REF="032239_0084_0FF19F241FFC3798">me to the &s;pot, and I could not but be &s;en&s;ibly affected at the tenderne&s;s which he di&s;played, when &s;peaking of them on this &s;cene of their valor and death. He appeared to me on this occa&s;ion, in a point of view very different from what he had at any time before, &s;o that I e&s;teemed the <HI>man</HI> now, whom I before con&s;idered as the <HI>&s;avage.</HI></P>
<P>His per&s;on was &s;trait and robu&s;t, and of excellent &s;ymetry, being about five feet ten inches high: his countenance was extremely expre&s;&s;ive; his eye quick and penetrating, and his air and deportment affable, cheerful, and mild, but &s;till expre&s;&s;ive of confidence and command. He appeared to be about 55 years old, but was more. He made a motion to return, and we all moved towards the city by way of the pa&s;s: our wives who had all followed us, now joined the party; and my ladies &s;ought every means to divert and plea&s;e me, during the walk, by plucking flowers and fruits, or picking up pieces of broken arrows or lances,
<PB N="86" REF="032239_0085_0FF19F2719BAAB80">and at the &s;ame time, pointing at places, and &s;peaking as if I under&s;tood every word they &s;aid&mdash;they continued their lively gambols all the way home.</P>
<P>This &s;pecies of amu&s;ement was at fir&s;t to me very loath&s;ome&mdash;but after &s;ome time, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, the pains they took to plea&s;e, and the little efforts they made in the hou&s;e, with their labor to teach and make me under&s;tand their language, &s;oon &s;oftened my di&s;gu&s;t: from laughing at their folly, I came to like it, and to be thankful for their efforts to excite it&mdash;and in &s;hort, I &s;oon became &s;o habituated to my &s;ituation, as not only to be &s;atisfied, but plea&s;ed with it. In fact, I felt a fondne&s;s for both my wives, although I reluctantly confe&s;s it to the ladies of my former acquaintance, for they never differed but in their efforts to plea&s;e me, and never di&s;puted, le&s;t I &s;hould be offended.</P>
<P>In all my &s;ub&s;equent rambles, they were never from me; when I talked to others,
<PB N="87" REF="032239_0086_0FF19F2B74F436A0">they were &s;ilently care&s;&s;ing me, playing with my hands, or hair, handling my &s;ide arms or pockets; if I &s;at, they &s;quatted at my feet, and my buckles became the objects of their care and curio&s;ity&mdash;for all which atten|tion and favor, they appeared highly gratified, if I made but a return of bare notice, and highly familar, if I would enter into conver|&s;ation with them.</P>
<P>We had now approached the town, and were met by &s;everal of the elders, and a con&s;iderable number of the inhabitants, both men and women, who formed a proce&s;&s;ion with us into the public &s;treets. I had now &s;ome lei&s;ure and opportunities to notice them; they were evidently, con&s;iderably blacker than the natives of the lower <HI>Congo</HI> country, and the neighbourhood of the &s;ea, who have generally a yellowi&s;h tinge in their com|plexion, owing, I &s;uppo&s;e, to their greater intercour&s;e with the whites. Their &s;tature is generally between five feet &s;ix inches, to &s;ix feet high; the fewer number, however,
<PB N="88" REF="032239_0087_0FF19F2D0D1E3B08">approach the latter height. The women were generally more &s;lender and &s;maller, as is u&s;ual, than the men; but were evidently more variable, in the fir&s;t re&s;pect particu|larly. Both &s;exes are admirably well formed, their limbs &s;trait, and bodies upright. They go almo&s;t entirely naked; the loins and wai&s;t only being covered; the women wear a &s;light garment, or bandage of cotton cloth round the wai&s;t, or a &s;mall apron of cotton &s;tuff, fancifully decorated with feathers, or &s;trips of different coloured cloths; this is about &s;ix inches long, and eight broad, hanging in front, and tied on by two &s;trings of cotton, which knot behind, from which hangs a little ta&s;&s;el. The men, from the age of puberty only, wear a narrow bandage of cotton cloth round the wai&s;t, with a &s;trip of the &s;ame kind, but five or &s;ix inches in breadth tucked in before, and pa&s;&s;ing thro' the crutch, &s;o contrived that the knot behind al&s;o affords a long bunch or ta&s;&s;el, like that of the women. The men of re&s;pect among them, be&s;ide a number of trifling ornaments
<PB N="89" REF="032239_0088_0FF19F315EBA41B8">of &s;hells, ivory bracelets, &amp;c. wear a large and broader piece of cotton, that hangs nearly down to the knees like the Scotch highlander's trews.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;imple garments, however di&s;play works of ornament, di&s;tinct from tho&s;e of mere utility; feathers, pieces of cotton cloth of different colours, trinkets of copper, bra&s;s, gla&s;s, and tin&s;el, of European fabri|cation are frequently &s;een, but the&s;e are uniformly the &s;igns of riches or re&s;pect. The old chief was dre&s;&s;ed with a profu&s;ion of the&s;e baubles, fanta&s;tically arranged on a kind of dark cotton &s;mock frock, that hung down clo&s;e to his knees.</P>
<P>Men and women uniformly wear rings round their wri&s;ts and ancles, mo&s;tly of ivory, but frequently made of bra&s;s; the&s;e are made merely large enough to admit the hand or foot through with &s;ome pre&s;&s;ure. Their loo&s;ene&s;s renders them to appearance incon|venient, but when we con&s;ider the numerous
<PB N="90" REF="032239_0089_0FF19F32EA335458">aukward articles worn by both &s;exes in <HI>civilized</HI> life, we will not continue to wonder at the &s;acrifices which &s;avages offer to that univer&s;al idol, <HI>vanity,</HI> &s;eeing that the&s;e ornaments carry in their minds as lofty ideas, as any excited either by the gold or embroi|dery, the coronet, the purple, or ermine.&mdash; The ivory rings are made by &s;awing the elephants tooth acro&s;s the hollow part, and poli&s;hing the rings with the du&s;t; there are &s;ome, however, who wear cla&s;ps or broad hoops, and other ornaments of gold.</P>
<P>The women wear beads of gla&s;s and metal with little plates, and other figures &s;u&s;pended from their necks in &s;ucce&s;&s;ive &s;trings falling over their brea&s;ts. Some of them that in infancy promi&s;e to be comely, by the early care of their mothers, have rings put on while young, which filling as they grow, become tight, and this ornament in their riper years is e&s;teemed an object of peculiar note and elegance. Their admirers are more numerous, and this &s;pecies of
<PB N="91" REF="032239_0090_0FF19F3478E0D250">ornaments often exhibits the love of &s;hew, admiration, and prudery in the &s;imple African, in as ridiculous and natural a point of view, as any of our poli&s;hed fa&s;hionable female decorations.</P>
<P>Every man wears a knife in his girdle, the blade of which is from &s;ix to eight inches long, re&s;embling the blade of a &s;pontoon, rather narrower, but &s;harp at both edges: it is carried in a &s;heath, generally of ru&s;h or reed work, and much ornamented. This in&s;trument &s;erves for all purpo&s;es, for cutting timber or food, &s;laying a bea&s;t or an enemy; and in occa&s;ions of war, is worn likewi&s;e by the women. They employ it in their &s;imple proce&s;s of agriculture with much dexterity, and this with a &s;harp pointed &s;take, was all the implement I could di&s;cover them u&s;ing, either for digging, turning up the &s;oil, &s;ow|ing or reaping the crop.</P>
<P>I have been thus particular in the out&s;et, from having ob&s;erved when very young,
<PB N="92" REF="032239_0091_0FF19F36132FAAB8">that circum&s;tances among &s;trangers are noticed more exactly at fir&s;t, than at a later period; perhaps familiarity with all objects le&s;&s;ens our admiration of them.</P>
<P>The next morning the king &s;hewed me the &s;poils made in the late action, which had taken place as nearly as I could learn, about the month of June preceding. The bracelets and rings of gold and copper, the gold brea&s;t plates, &s;ome European &s;words, and a numberle&s;s quantity of trinkets, &s;pears, bows and arrows, &amp;c. formed a group of objects extremely &s;triking and amu&s;ing. The &s;ame apartment contained a variety of other articles, &s;uch as pre&s;ents made him by his own people, and by others, together with a quantity of elephants teeth and gold du&s;t, which was contained in &s;mall earthen pans, or pots, covered with wicker ba&s;ket work.</P>
<P>Having &s;atisfied my curio&s;ity here, he propo&s;ed that I &s;hould go and &s;ee the pri&s;oners; we accordingly cro&s;&s;ed to the
<PB N="93" REF="032239_0092_0FF19F3A94944B98">&s;outh-ea&s;tern &s;ide of the rivulet, where at the lower &s;ide of the town, we found them confined in a large area within a thick &s;tockade, on the out&s;ide of which was a trench: the in&s;ide was divided into parcels, and huts irregularly con&s;tructed, and the entrance as well as the whole circuit, was guarded by men with &s;pears.</P>
<P>We commonly find our&s;elves impre&s;&s;ed with emotions of horror and compa&s;&s;ion, on entering places where our fellow men are doomed to puni&s;hment or thraldom. In the &s;cene before me, the ear was not indeed dinned with the clanking of heavy fetters, but was horrible in its peculiar way. The captives were di&s;titute for the mo&s;t part of even their nece&s;&s;ary covering, and bound indi&s;criminately together by the hands and legs, the cords being again fa&s;tened to the ground by &s;takes; they were loo&s;ed a few at a time once every day, when each was permitted to eat the only meal they were allowed, con&s;i&s;ting of rice and palm oil.

<P>I had often in the cour&s;e of the voyage, and of the journey, rebuked my&s;elf for having embarked in the African trade, but found a con&s;olation in the reflection, that it was not from a malicious inclination or avaricious di&s;po&s;ition, that I had embarked in it, but from the pre&s;&s;ing call of nece&s;&s;ity, and at a time when my di&s;&s;ent could not alter or ob&s;truct the undertaking. On the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, however, I was fully convinced the removal of the&s;e poor wretches even into the &s;lavery of the We&s;t-Indies, would be an act of humanity, rather than one expo&s;ed to cen&s;ure.</P>
<P>We pa&s;&s;ed through the whole range of the place of confinement, the old chief

I agreed to do &s;o, but reque&s;ted that I might have an opportunity of conver&s;ing with them, and chu&s;ing &s;uch as would go with me voluntarily, if any could be found. To this he readily a&s;&s;ented; and for the next week I continued to vi&s;it them daily, and took occa&s;ion through my interpreter, to exhibit as flattering a pro&s;pect of their future &s;ituation in America, &s;hould they go with me, as I thought was ju&s;t in it&s;elf, and favorable to their wi&s;hes.</P>
<P>This week was occupied by occa&s;ional excur&s;ions, in fi&s;hing and hunting parties, in plea&s;ant evening entertainments, and at intervals by my vi&s;its to the captives. Hav|ing arranged matters on this &s;ubject to my mind, I mentioned to the old king the &s;everal articles which I propo&s;ed exchanging with

The <HI>Galla</HI> nation having &s;uffered &s;o much by their la&s;t war, had now became fearful of mole&s;ting or interfering with the <HI>Ebo</HI> people, a circum&s;tance, which if we had previou&s;ly known, would have &s;aved us a long circuitous and trouble&s;ome journey, which might now be performed with ea&s;e in one half the time.</P>
<P>The old Chief was much plea&s;ed; three per&s;ons were appointed to carry my di&s;patches, and they departed accordingly. From this time, I had no occupation but making my&s;elf acquainted with the language and manners of the country, and obtaining &s;uch infor|mation as they could afford.</P>

The fore&s;ts were ravaged for veni&s;on, and the trees for fruit; the palm poured forth its exhilerating juices, and every &s;kin &s;hined in bright blackne&s;s with the anointing of rich oils. The elders wore their be&s;t <HI>makad:</HI> or dre&s;&s;es, and the young girls di&s;played their feathers and rings with all the purpo&s;ed artifice of coquetry.&mdash;The fea&s;t is held on a lawn or plain, the conver&s;ation is general, on &s;ub|jects of love, war, or hunting; the parties employed taking frequent opportunities of making it partial. The generous entertainer takes care that all are &s;atisfied, encourages the warriours to valour, the lovers to fidelity, and reminds them that the&s;e virtues are the only &s;ure paths to univer&s;al regard. The&s;e &s;entiments, no doubt, are not expre&s;&s;ed in their regular form, but in this way (if I may &s;o expre&s;s it) may their ideas and expre&s;&s;ions be tran&s;lated.

<P>The repa&s;t terminates with a dance, to the mu&s;ic of two &s;orts of drums; the one made by cutting the trunk of a hollow tree acro&s;s about a foot in diameter, and eighteen inches long. The bark is pulled off and the knotty parts made &s;mooth; a &s;quare hole is cut in its &s;ide, and a piece of dried &s;heep &s;kin drawn light over it; both ends are covered in the &s;ame way, and beads, rings, &amp;c. are fixed to it. The other kind is the gourd or callaba&s;h, cut off at one &s;ide, and a &s;kin drawn over it in like manner, both the&s;e in&s;truments are &s;ounded by &s;trik|ing with the hand or fingers. The dance, as may be &s;uppo&s;ed, is neither plea&s;ant to the eye, nor agreeable to the ear of a per&s;on acquainted with the &s;ound of a violin, but
<PB N="102" REF="032239_0101_0FF19F53A83B3D78">to them is a &s;ource of the greate&s;t enjoy|ment.</P>
<P>From the&s;e particulars, it might po&s;&s;ibly be &s;uppo&s;ed that the inhabitants are of a very active character. The rever&s;e how|ever, is the fact; they are from the natural effect of the climate, indolent to an extreme, but in ca&s;es of exigency exhibit a vigor that is truly &s;urprizing. Their wants are but few, and a warm &s;un and prolific &s;oil &s;upercedes that powerful &s;timulus to activity&mdash;<HI>nece&s;&s;ity.</HI> They know not tho&s;e cares which call forth labour, to provide for their children, nature is their inheritance; if they po&s;&s;e&s;s rice, roots, and palm wine, a cow, a few goats or &s;heep to afford them occa&s;ionally milk or meat, to feed them&s;elves and entertain their friends, they enjoy con|&s;ummate happine&s;s. In metals they find little value, except for occa&s;ional ornament and ex|change for provi&s;ions. For this purpo&s;e mo&s;tly when prompted by the &s;oft pa&s;&s;ion, both &s;exes will &s;pend weeks in tedious &s;ucce&s;&s;ion
<PB N="103" REF="032239_0102_0FF19F57F267E670">gathering gold du&s;t in but &s;canty portions. The command of a parent, the de&s;ire of a brother or &s;i&s;ter, or the order of a chief, will procure the like a&s;&s;iduity, but the&s;e latter occa&s;ions are rare. This operation is performed only in the rainy &s;ea&s;on, when the torrents which fall wa&s;h down from the high lands, the &s;ands and &s;oil in which the&s;e riches are lodged. The &s;pecific gravity of the metal cau&s;es it to &s;ub&s;ide, while lighter bodies are hurried along with the waters, and thus it is that where the roots of trees, or crevices between rocks, &s;u&s;pend the rapid cour&s;e of the &s;tream, the gold du&s;t &s;ettles with the coar&s;er particles of the &s;and, and is gathered by the African, and depo&s;ited in his gourd or calaba&s;h.</P>
<P>When a &s;ufficient quantity is collected, it is taken to a &s;tanding water, where it is again cleanly wa&s;hed from all particles of earth, and in this &s;tate is re&s;erved for their purpo&s;es of trade, or for being formed into trinkets. This they perform with the rude

<P>I have before noticed that polygamy is cu&s;tomary among them, for having no reli|gious in&s;titutions, the practice cannot be con&s;idered a matter of toleration; but it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that be the number of wives ever &s;o many, there is uniformly one who holds a di&s;tingui&s;hed place in the family. She is called the <HI>makilma,</HI> and has the privi|lege of directing the dome&s;tic concerns and employments of the re&s;t; &s;he &s;its next to the ma&s;ter of the family, and obtains a &s;uit|able and undi&s;puted regard from all the other members of it, who&s;e labours &s;he &s;uperintends and controuls; for however opulent the hu&s;band may be, his wives mu&s;t work, and by them are all the labours of agri|culture u&s;ually performed. This appears cer|tainly very laborious con&s;idering the heat of
<PB N="105" REF="032239_0104_0FF19F5B40BE0C58">the climate, but it mu&s;t likewi&s;e be ob&s;erved, that the &s;oil is luxuriant, and the vegetation rapid, the &s;ea&s;ons of tillage though frequent, are &s;hort, and the wants of the &s;avage life few and &s;imple; he mu&s;t be a poor and a &s;piritle&s;s African, who cannot maintain three or four wives.</P>
<P>The &s;erenity and evenne&s;s of their tem|pers is truly admirable; their cheerfulne&s;s is &s;eldom clouded by pa&s;&s;ion; and jealou&s;y is rare among the men, although the women are by no means aver&s;e to gallantry. In fact, the commerce of the &s;exes, as may have been already &s;urmi&s;ed by the reader, is not &s;hackled by the forms of laws, or the refine|ments of etiquette or hypocri&s;y; the &s;en&s;e of &s;hame is totally di&s;connected with their ideas on this head, though no people are more &s;trenuous and confined in their attach|ments when once formed from mutual choice.</P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="032239_0105_0FF19F5E5B5D0140">
Irregularities of conduct are not, however, tolerated, though the di&s;covery is not attend|ed with di&s;grace; the gallant, if detected, is &s;ubjected to a fine, by the per&s;on aggrieved, &s;uch as a &s;heep, a goat, a cow, &s;ome rice, and the like. In&s;tances have been known of a hu&s;band conniving with his wife, to entice per&s;ons into this &s;nare, and to &s;hare the exactions of their treacherous cunning; &s;uch in&s;tances, however, are extremely rare, and not peculiar to the black children of Africa.</P>
<P>In other re&s;pects they exhibit examples that would do honour to the mo&s;t exalted people of the civilized world: in friend&s;hip and benevolence, no people are &s;o truly &s;tedfa&s;t and di&s;intere&s;ted; and theft, the reputed vice of all &s;avages, is rarely known among them; the unfortunate are &s;ure of the &s;olacing aid and &s;upport of their friends, who&s;e kindne&s;s does not halt even at the lap&s;e of life. When a neighbour dies poor, they a&s;&s;emble and perform certain ceremonies with the &s;ame
<PB N="107" REF="032239_0106_0FF19F62B516F910">re&s;pect as if he were one of their own chiefs; if he leaves children unprovided for, they are adopted and bred up; if marriageable, they are provided with &s;uitable companions, and the means to commence a new family.</P>
<P>Hearing that the ma&s;ter of a family whom I had &s;een on my arrival, was dead in my neighbourhood, I was inclined to attend, having heard that their funeral ceremonies were &s;trangely ludicrous. It is their rule never to bury the body on the day of decea&s;e, the intervening night being devoted to lamen|tation; the women of the family perform the clamorous part of this duty, and with little intermi&s;&s;ion, until the corps is interred. They &s;eat them&s;elves in order round the decea&s;ed, his favorite wife being &s;eated at the head; if the decea&s;ed be a woman, the mo&s;t beloved matron of the family performs the &s;ame office. Should the family not afford a &s;ufficient number of women, they call in friends, or employ &s;trangers to a&s;&s;i&s;t them, whom they reward according to
<PB N="108" REF="032239_0107_0FF19F644582DF98">merit. In the pre&s;ent in&s;tance, the decea&s;ed had been rich, but had few female relatives be&s;ides his wives, who hearing that I meant to attend the funeral, had re&s;olved to &s;how their re&s;pect for the decea&s;ed ma&s;ter, in the mo&s;t pompous manner, by procuring a lamentation which they could not of them|&s;elves find lungs to &s;upport. It appeared, however, that the per&s;ons employed had been differently rewarded, and their tones varied in proportion to the value received, all were found too low for the occa&s;ion. The wives were di&s;&s;atisfied, but re&s;orted to the expedient of further pre&s;ents to promote the vigour of their grief: a &s;en&s;ible effect was produced, for with an increa&s;e of &s;ound from the lamenters, there was an evident change in the tone of what they uttered, different from that of the widows, and very different from that of grief. The matrons had further re&s;ort to their fir&s;t plan, but the poor women unaccu&s;tomed to di&s;&s;emble, could not now conceal under their wailings, the &s;atisfaction which they derived from the
<PB N="109" REF="032239_0108_0FF19F68C40D1C00">value of their pre&s;ents received, and &s;carcely re&s;train the &s;mile. The wives them&s;elves appeared glad, when I vi&s;ited them on the morning, at the approaching period of their grief; when the good man was wrapped in a kind of mattra&s;s, and carried to a grave where he was interred, and further lamen|tation cea&s;ed. The whole then returned to the hou&s;e of the decea&s;ed, and the &s;cene of grief was converted into merriment; men and women regaled with palm wine, and then di&s;per&s;ed to their re&s;pective homes.</P>
<P>Their notions concerning death, prove that they have an idea of a future &s;tate of exi&s;tence; they believe that after a given time, they mu&s;t return to their own country, and remain forever free from care or pain; on this account it &s;hould &s;eem that they are always ho&s;pitable to &s;trangers on their arrival among them, as they con&s;ider &s;uch per&s;ons coming thither, and from a judicious choice prefering it to other countries.</P>

Girls are u&s;ually marriageable at fourteen, but few of them bear their virgin zone untied to the nuptial bed; this, however, is never a &s;ubject of &s;olicitude or enquiry.

Their appear|ance has con&s;iderable effect in exciting the&s;e unfriendly opinions of the Albinos in the minds of the people.

<P>The&s;e people rendered unfortunate by a prejudice of their countrymen, are born of black parents, they have all the features of other inhabitants, but differ from them only in the&s;e circum&s;tances. The difference in colour cannot ari&s;e from the intercour&s;e of whites and blacks, for the whites are very rarely among them, and the re&s;ult of this union is well known to be the yellow or mulatto. Many of the Natives a&s;&s;ert that they are produced by the women, being debauched in pa&s;&s;ing through the woods by the large Baboon, the Ourang-outang, and that &s;pecies in particular called the <HI>Quaga mooroos.</HI> No &s;atisfactory di&s;covery has been made to account for &s;uch &s;ingular, but not unfrequent, phenomena in the &s;pecies, it may perhaps be a&s;cribed to di&s;ea&s;e, and that

<P>The time of new moon is always attended to, and celebrated as a fe&s;tival by the <HI>Ebo</HI> nation. No work is done on this day, nor do they enter into contracts, or execute bu&s;ine&s;s, though the occa&s;ion be of ever &s;o ungent a nature. The different families a&s;&s;emble at an appointed place, and begin to dance by the time it is clear day, and con|tinue till the heat becomes di&s;agreeable: they then retire and enjoy each others com|pany in &s;mall parties, in different places throughout the day, drinking of palm wine, and renewing the dance in the evening.</P>
<P>Their year is divided into four parts; the &s;unny &s;ea&s;on, the tornado &s;ea&s;on, the rainy &s;ea&s;on, and the foggy &s;ea&s;on, no &s;ub|divion, &s;uch as months and weeks, are attended to, except the different periods of
<PB N="119" REF="032239_0118_0FF130ABE7F7DF60" MS="y">new moon, by which they a&s;certain the time of planting their rice, hunting, fi&s;hing and building.</P>
<P>The &s;unny &s;ea&s;on commences about the la&s;t of December, and ends about the la&s;t of April, continuing not le&s;s than four months, in which time the inhabitants collect the different kinds of fruit, intended for provi&s;ions; gather in their rice, and provide in general again&s;t the more unfriendly &s;ea&s;on. The country being &s;ituated between the 10&deg; and 12&deg; of &s;outh latitude, this &s;ea&s;on an&s;wers to that of &s;ummer in our climate; the month of February being e&s;teemed mid|&s;ummer with them. In this &s;ea&s;on the inha|bitants are frequently vi&s;ited by the land cloud, called ferrino by the Portugue&s;e, which is mo&s;t frequent in the dry &s;ultry weather, about the time of noon, and mo&s;tly when ea&s;terly winds prevail. It makes its appearance like a cloud, or thick white mi&s;t extended but a few hundred yards in breadth, but in length covering the &s;pace of one or
<PB N="120" REF="032239_0119_0FF19F882F3FB7E8">two miles, in height not exceeding one hun|dred feet. There are many varieties, how|ever, in the&s;e particulars of extent, it being remarked that the large&s;t are in general the lea&s;t di&s;tre&s;&s;ing, from the circum&s;tance of their being more diffu&s;ed, and le&s;s den&s;e than the &s;maller. When one of the&s;e clouds appears, the inhabitants &s;hut them&s;elves up in their hou&s;es, the goats, &s;heep, &amp;c. fly for &s;helter to the neare&s;t hovels or thickets, and every animal appears anxious to avoid expo&s;ure to its influence. When it comes in contact with the body, a &s;en&s;ible increa&s;e of heat is fir&s;t ob&s;erved, the re&s;piration is then in&s;tantly affected in a very peculiar manner, attended with an itching, prickling &s;en&s;ation on the &s;kin, increa&s;ing with the length of expo&s;ure, &s;o as to be almo&s;t into|lerable, with a dryne&s;s and actual change of colour in the negro, from the black, to a du&s;ky grey. It does not appear to affect the re&s;piration by any &s;en&s;ible quality of its own, for no &s;tricture or pain is perceptible about the brea&s;t when taken into the lungs, but
<PB N="121" REF="032239_0120_0FF19F8B4FDC93D0">an extravagant anxiety, an unea&s;ine&s;s of mind, a want of &s;ome thing to &s;upport life, the nature of which we did not under&s;tand, was very evident. Its increa&s;ed heat could not be the cau&s;e, for common atmo&s;pheric air of that or a much greater temperature, would not produce effects in any degree equal to this&mdash;viz. the de&s;truction of life. Its colour and its continuing in contact with the &s;urface of the earth, although warmer than the &s;urrounding atmot&s;phere, will prove it to be a fluid very different from common air; probably &s;ome exhalation or eruption, &s;imilar to the volcanic, di&s;charged from the earth in the va&s;t de&s;erts ea&s;tward of this, by the violent and con&s;tant action of heat, and wafted on by the prevalence of ear&s;terly winds. This at lea&s;t is certain, that it is an air deprived of that property by which life is &s;upported, for it uniformly extingui&s;hes the fires over which it pa&s;&s;es. This cloud is more particularly injurious in high and open &s;itu|ations, in the neighbourhood of the city, where the country is low, and &s;heltered by
<PB N="122" REF="032239_0121_0FF19F8D0F8E8F28" MS="y">the adjoining hills; in&s;tances of death from this &s;ource are but rare; back of this, how|ever, where the country is higher and more expo&s;ed, they are by no means unfrequent, particularly among the wild animals; &s;ome|times likewi&s;e, the dome&s;tic animals, and occa|&s;ionally the unfortunate inhabitants expe|rience its de&s;tructive influence.</P>
<P>The weather continues warm without interruption, except by a few occa&s;ional &s;howers of rain, till the la&s;t of April, when the &s;ea&s;on of Tornados commences. The&s;e are violent hurricanes that infe&s;t the warm tropical elements, throughout this part of the year. They are in general preceded by an uncommon degree of calmne&s;s and &s;tillne&s;s in the air, the leaves of the trees cea&s;e to move, and the ponds and other waters re&s;emble gla&s;s by the &s;moothne&s;s of their &s;urfaces, every thing indicating a &s;upen&s;ion of circulation in the atmo&s;pheric air. In that night and next day, the wind ri&s;es, but is extremely irregular, changing rapidly to
<PB N="123" REF="032239_0122_0FF19F92D70FABD8">all points of the compa&s;s, and-blowing from them only in &s;udden gu&s;ts, or what are called flaws. At length a &s;udden and violent bla&s;t is ob&s;erved from the we&s;t; the horizon begins now to be covered with &s;cattered clouds, and one black, peculiarly thick and heavy cloud makes its appearance in &s;ome point we&s;twardly. This advances rapidly, extending it&s;elf over the greater part of the horizon, attended with con&s;tant and reite|rated claps of thunder, and the mo&s;t &s;evere fla&s;hes of lightning, which appear to contend for pre-eminence with the extraordinary darkne&s;s, which would otherwi&s;e prevail; torrents of rain &s;ucceed, which by their weight and violence, would threaten to force away even the earth it&s;elf in its cour&s;e. To a &s;cene of this kind I was witne&s;s, after my return from the pre&s;ent expedition, while we lay on the river receiving the remainder of the cargo. I thought it the mo&s;t awfully maje&s;tic of any &s;ight I had ever beheld, and &s;uch as would afford a mo&s;t elegant field for the de&s;criptive genius of &s;ome poet, to di&s;play
<PB N="124" REF="032239_0123_0FF19F9731260418">it&s;elf into advantage. To &s;ee a partial mid|night, like a mon&s;ter winging its cour&s;e through the air, darting from its horrid brow the ince&s;&s;ant &s;treams of electric fire, enforcing &s;ilent and awful attention by the con&s;tant and reiterated peals of dreadful thunder, and marking its progre&s;s by the va&s;t deluge of rain which uniformly falls as it advances, leaves an impre&s;&s;ion on the mind of the mo&s;t impo&s;ing grandeur that can be imagined.</P>
<P>This di&s;agreeable &s;ea&s;on, in which the inhabitants live under the continued impre&s;|&s;ion of fear, is not as lengthy as the others. It commences as mentioned before, in the la&s;t of April, and is generally over by the middle, or la&s;t of June. About this time the rainy &s;ea&s;on &s;ets in, and continues without interrup|tion till the end of September, in all which time, &s;carcely a day pa&s;&s;es without the country being drenched by one or more &s;howers of rain, the violence and force of which, can &s;carcely be conceived by tho&s;e who have only
<PB N="125" REF="032239_0124_0FF19F9A2E32D7E0">lived in the northern or even middle latitudes. Next en&s;ues the &s;ea&s;on very properly called the Foggy, from the &s;un being ob&s;cured throughout the greate&s;t part of the day, by a thick den&s;e fog, which falling at night, covers the whole horizon &s;o completely as not to admit of a view, except for the di&s;|tance of a few yards. This is doubtle&s;s occa&s;ioned by the cold in the upper regions in the atmo&s;phere, conden&s;ing the water evaporated from the ponds, mar&s;hes, and low grounds, which are all overflown and covered with water, by the exce&s;&s;ive rains in the preceding &s;ea&s;on. The heat of the &s;un produces the evaporation, the cold of night en&s;uing, conden&s;es the vapour which de&s;cend|ing in con&s;equence, ob&s;cures the pro&s;pect, till the &s;un on the &s;ucceeding day, re&s;tores it to the form of vapour, and occa&s;ions a further exhalation. This continues until the exce&s;s of water is either evaporated, or has run off, which generally takes place about the la&s;t of December&mdash;the &s;ucceeding, or &s;unny &s;ea&s;on, gliding on imperceptibly
<PB N="126" REF="032239_0125_0FF19F9D1BBB3288">as this declines. The fir&s;t part of this &s;ea&s;on is properly &s;peaking, their winter, for though the weather about noon would be called warm by per&s;ons in our climate, yet the mornings are in general, &s;uch as are &s;tiled raw and cold.</P>
<P>My time was now con&s;tantly occupied by the cu&s;toms and characters of the people, among whom I lived; and the 22 days of danger and fatigue, which I had endured on the journey, appeared but as hours of plea|&s;ant trial long pa&s;t, for, from the 7th. of March, the day of the departure of the me&s;&s;engers, to their return on the 3d. of April, having no other objects to engro&s;s my attention, I had become &s;o perfectly familiar with my company and way of life, that I could almo&s;t have brought my&s;elf, if &s;elf alone were concerned, to relinqui&s;h the bu&s;tle and cares of enlightened &s;ociety, to partake of the &s;implicity and kind manners of the cheerful African.</P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="032239_0126_0FF19F9EA85C32F8">
I had become de&s;irous of acquiring all their knowledge, and found the people ready to communicate what they knew;&mdash;among others of their arts, and of the mo&s;t impor|tant to them, that of extracting the oil from the fruit of the palm tree, excited my curio|&s;ity, becau&s;e the proce&s;s indicates a combi|nation of ideas, that the Africans are alledged incapable of maintaining.</P>
<P>The palm tree&mdash;the object which fir&s;t attracts the ob&s;erving eye of the &s;tranger, and the regard of the natives, is called <HI>Avoura;</HI> the various u&s;es to which it is capable of being applied, ju&s;tify their predilection. It ri&s;es to the height of, from 58 to 60 feet, pre&s;ents a trunk at its full growth of from 30 inches to 3 feet in diameter, at the height of 4 feet from the ground it in&s;en&s;ibly le&s;&s;ens, but without branches to the top, where it may be about a foot or more, in diameter. From this part the branches, or rather fibrous leaves, expand in a beautiful tuft like rays from a centre, to the variable length
<PB N="128" REF="032239_0127_0FF19FA039742528">of &s;ix, eight, and twelve feet. In order to procure the wine and the fruit, they climb this tree, with remarkable &s;peed and adroitne&s;s, by means of a rope, or hoop, which enclo&s;es the trunk of the tree, but &s;o as to leave commodious room for action to the climber. He being provided with his empty calaba&s;hes, and a knife in his girdle, places him&s;elf within the hoop, again&s;t which he leans his back, and rai&s;es him&s;elf up by his feet, placed again&s;t the tree, till he can ri&s;e no higher, when he has thus far elevated him&s;elf, he gra&s;ps the tree in his arms, and rai&s;es the hoop as far up as it will extend, and again leans again&s;t the hoop, thus conti|nues to rai&s;e him&s;elf by his feet and the hoop, until he gains the top, where with his knife, he cuts away &s;uch of the branches as are nece&s;&s;ary, to afford room for his calaba&s;h. He then proceeds to make an inci&s;ion in the tree, and forms a lip or &s;pout, for the con|veyance of the juice, which flows in a few days from this aperture. Sometimes they fix a &s;mall piece of a hollow cane in the hole,
<PB N="129" REF="032239_0128_0FF19FA1CC6AA660">through which the liquor flows for nearly a month, they taking care to &s;upply new ve&s;&s;els to receive it accordingly as the others fill; when it appears to flow &s;lowly, they kindle a fire at the foot of the tree, and it again flows, as fa&s;t as formerly, but the tree is then exhau&s;ted, and will not bear again, but it is converted to dome&s;tic u&s;es. The juice when fre&s;h drawn, re&s;embles water &s;lightly coloured by milk; in the cour&s;e of a few hours, however, it undergoes a light fermentation, and becomes a wine of very plea&s;ant flavour, much re&s;embling that of the weak Spani&s;h white wines, but &s;oon lo&s;es the&s;e properties, being unlike other wines, growing wor&s;e by age. But the fruit is the mo&s;t valuable part; this grows at the top between the branches; when young, it is u&s;ed as food by roa&s;ting, and is of delicate flavour, being covered when full grown and ripe, with a hard &s;hell of a brown colour, but which when cut, appears black in the edge. The oil, &s;o e&s;&s;ential an article of food, and of dome&s;tic u&s;e, for
<PB N="130" REF="032239_0129_0FF19FA7C0BD50D8">anointing their bodies, feeding their lamps, and various other u&s;es, is procured by expre&s;&s;ion. The nuts are broken in a trough made of a hollowed tree, and planks radely hewn are then placed over each other for the pre&s;s, the power of compre&s;&s;ion being produced by a long piece of timber, acting as a lever, is made firm at one end, clo&s;e beyond the planks, and re&s;ting on them, the other end is forced down by the weight of a number of per&s;ons, who place them|&s;elves on it, until they find by the quantity of oil that has run off, that it has been &s;uffi|ciently pre&s;&s;ed. The oil appears of a crude reddi&s;h colour when fre&s;h, but changes to yellow, and at length to white. To the palate of the white man, this oil in any &s;tate is very nau&s;eous at fir&s;t, until like tobacco, from being di&s;agreeable, habit renders it plea&s;ant; the Africans employ it in all their meals, with yams, rice, millet, fi&s;h, and even with beef and mutton.</P>

The palm po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es many u&s;eful qualities be&s;ide the&s;e above de&s;cribed; and in re&s;pect to beauty, it mu&s;t certainly be ranked fir&s;t of the graces of the fore&s;t, or the land&s;cape; of inferior trees and &s;hrubs, Africa affords abundance. I have already noticed &s;ome on the route toward the capital; but the toils of travel, and the calls of appetite under circum&s;tances, &s;uch as I made my tour hither, left very little room for the mental ta&s;te to feed upon, and perhaps at times jaundiced the eye, and converted the luxuriance of the enamelled plain or fruitful wilderne&s;s, into &s;imple unintere&s;ting wa&s;tes; certain it is, that on my excur&s;ions in my hours of lei&s;ure, the wild boar that would have appeared an object of horror, under the impre&s;&s;ions of fatigue and anxiety, no longer excited any apprehen&s;ions; I could calculate upon the whitene&s;s of his tu&s;ks, and the moro&s;ene&s;s of his a&s;pect, as objects of traffic and curio|&s;ity; and I would in&s;tead of trembling, le&s;t I &s;hould hear, travel under the dews of night, heedle&s;s of &s;leep, to li&s;ten to the hoar&s;e

An a&s;&s;ortment &s;o exten&s;ive and rich in their eyes, had never been there before; and bargains were very &s;oon made for goods, in exchange for 100 &s;laves, (being ordered not to bring down more) for the re&s;t I procured ivory and gold, in du&s;t and bars. In the&s;e dealings I found my wives of more u&s;e to me than my companion <HI>Hurdee,</HI> for they
<PB N="138" REF="032239_0137_0FF19FBFB4C5E340">&s;incerely &s;tudied my intere&s;t, while he &s;tudied to profit him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Being informed by my wives, that if I had a quantity of goods at the capital, I &s;hould be likely to turn the whole to valu|able account, I determined to take with me as much as the hor&s;es we had could bear, and the people for a rea&s;onable reward, would be prevailed on to carry. Accordingly we &s;et out on our return to the city, where we arrived without any other difficulty, than what aro&s;e from the ordinary labour of tra|vel, and the heat of the weather, for I was now too well acquainted with the <HI>comforts</HI> of repo&s;e under the canopy of heaven, without any other furniture than the thick leaved trees, to complain at trifles.</P>
<P>I was con&s;iderably diverted during my return by the effects which ornaments pro|duced on the vanity of tho&s;e who had acquired them, either by traffic or labour. Their
<PB N="139" REF="032239_0138_0FF19FC2A3DD6198">pa&s;&s;ion for &s;piritous liquors, was likewi&s;e exce&s;&s;ive, but I was both &s;urpri&s;ed and plea&s;ed, to find their effects on the tempers of the Africans, &s;o very different from that of our American &s;avages. Tho&s;e who pur|cha&s;ed them, u&s;ed them at fir&s;t divertingly, trying the ta&s;te of them in &s;mall &s;ips, fre|quently repeated until their operation com|menced, or the experimenters became toler|ably intoxicated. A rude &s;cene of drollery then was acted; fits of laughter and antic pranks were played; the parties running, hallowing, climbing trees, and the like, without the lea&s;t di&s;po&s;ition to mi&s;chief or ill humour. I reflected frequently on the outrages and crimes committed in drunken|ne&s;s by the American Indians, but could not account in any &s;atisfactory way, for the &s;in|gular contra&s;t between their behaviour, and that of the Africans under &s;imilar circum|&s;tances.</P>
<P>We were received with great &s;atisfaction by the old chief and his family, and by our
<PB N="140" REF="032239_0139_0FF19FC42FE640B8">general acquaintances in the city; the goods brought by the deputation, gave him parti|cular &s;atisfaction, and I contrived to con|vince him of my gratitude for his attention, by a pre&s;ent of &s;ome pa&s;te jewellery, which though coar&s;e in the eye of one acquainted with their true worth, were of a lu&s;tre and value, in the eyes of the <HI>Ebo</HI> king and his people, comparatively &s;uperior to the diamonds of the Indies; a hand&s;ome hanger with a plate hilt, completed my pre&s;ent, and made him in his own e&s;timation, one of the riche&s;t of potentates.</P>
<P>Having arranged affairs for the &s;ale of the remaining effects, the intelligence was &s;oon &s;pread around the adjacent villages, and the whole as &s;oon converted into ivory, and gold in bars and du&s;t. It &s;oon became nece&s;&s;ary for me to prepare for the chief, but mo&s;t irk&s;ome and difficult part of my duty. The &s;laves that I had purcha&s;ed were young men, many of whom being eager to e&s;cape from their bondage in <HI>Ebo,</HI> preferred the evil that
<PB N="141" REF="032239_0140_0FF19FC897F60C68">they "knew not of" to that which they then felt; but the majority were evidently affected with grief at their approaching departure.</P>
<P>Arrangements were made, and a &s;ufficient body of the <HI>Ebo</HI> people undertook to accom|pany me as a guard to the place of embarka|tion; provi&s;ions were provided for the journey, &s;o that each of the &s;laves was well fed, and a load of provi&s;ions or goods given him to carry. They were tied to poles in rows, four feet apart; a loo&s;e wicker bandage round the neck of each, connected him to the pole, and the arms being pinioned by a bandage affixed behind above the elbows, they had &s;ufficient room to feed, but not to loo&s;e them&s;elves, or commit any violence; and as the guard was provided with arms, we had nothing to apprehend during the night, as we divided the <HI>Ebo</HI> people into parties, one of which &s;lept while the other watched.</P>
<P><PB N="142" REF="032239_0141_0FF19FCB8FE83848">
We &s;et out from the city about 5 o'clock in the morning; the old King and his family, the elders and their families, and my two wives; of the former I took my leave, with evident marks of regret; the old man telling me if I &s;hould come that way &s;oon, he would be fond of &s;eeing me at my own hou&s;e, for he &s;hould continue henceforth to call that part of his own, mine, which I had occupied; my wives accompanied me.</P>
<P>This journey was extremely different in its nature from that in which I had la&s;t pa&s;&s;ed this way; the giddy pranks of the vain, or the inebriated <HI>Ebo,</HI> was woefully contra&s;ted by the &s;ullen melancholy, and deep &s;ighs of the poor <HI>Galla</HI> pri&s;oners: often did they look back with eyes flowing with tears, turn &s;ud|den round and gaze, &s;eeming to part with reluctance, even from their former bondage. It was exce&s;&s;ively affecting to me, but I con|&s;idered that death night have been their &s;ure otherwi&s;e, and I endeavored to reconcile them to their condition, by repre&s;enting flat|tering
<PB N="143" REF="032239_0142_0FF19FCE828249C8">accounts of the country to which they were going; that the bonds they then bore were only to prevent their flight; that they &s;hould be at their liberty where they were going, and have plenty to eat, drink, &amp;c. The&s;e a&s;&s;urances occa&s;ioned a temporary compo&s;ure, and we at length arrived at the place of our embarkation; two boats had been brought up, as the &s;hallop drew too much water; the &s;laves were put on board, and nece&s;&s;arily in irons brought for the purpo&s;e.&mdash;This mea&s;ure occa&s;ioned one of the mo&s;t affecting &s;cenes I ever witne&s;&s;ed: their hopes with my a&s;&s;urances had buoyed them up on the road; but a change from the cordage to iron fetters, rent their hopes and hearts together: their wailiags were torturing beyond what words can expre&s;s; but delay at this cri&s;is would have been fatal; the boat's crews were acquainted with the duty, and they were all &s;afely embarked.</P>
<P>Meanwhile I had retired from the painful &s;cene, and had to arrange my departure &s;o as
<PB N="144" REF="032239_0143_0FF19FD1890D0C10">to leave the two affectionate creatures who had been &s;o anxious to procure me every &s;atisfaction during my re&s;idence with them. It was a ta&s;k more delicate (although affec|tion cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed as concerned) than may be believed by tho&s;e who are unacquaint|ed with vici&s;&s;itudes of an adventurous life, and &s;uch as would be deemed ab&s;urd to tho&s;e who&s;e &s;tandard for judging the feelings and actions of all mankind is formed by the education, the habits, and prejudices of a particular &s;ociety. I had prepared &s;ome pre|&s;ents for them, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;uch trifles as I deemed &s;uitable to their &s;ex and tempers; <HI>Koomla</HI> the talle&s;t was a graceful young wo|man, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a degree of &s;en&s;ibility and di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s that might be deemed un|common even under a fair complexion and a more temperate climate. <HI>Yanee</HI> who&s;e tem|per was more lively, di&s;played her feelings in a different way; <HI>Koomla</HI> with her head reclined, expre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf by &s;ighs and up|braidings that I &s;hould go without her; <HI>Yanee</HI> believed that I would, as I &s;aid, &s;oon
<PB N="145" REF="032239_0144_0FF19FD32A38AF70">return again; the former would not accept my pre&s;ents, the latter enjoined her to keep them for my &s;ake, and told me &s;he would make it her care to plea&s;e <HI>Koomla</HI> till I &s;hould return: &s;he would &s;till fain that both &s;hould go with me.&mdash;I promi&s;ed &s;hortly to return, and enjoined them to take care of each other, that on my return I might find both well as I meant to re&s;ide then with them. They followed me to the edge of the river and held me by the coat till I broke from them and jumped on board the boat, when they both bur&s;t into tears, and were carre&s;&s;ed by the re&s;t of the natives among whom I had di&s;tributed &s;uch little baubles as remained with me.</P>
<P>We &s;oon lo&s;t &s;ight of them in a winding of the river; and continued going down with the current till night; the &s;laves &s;eemed every hour to feel their &s;ituation more griev|ou&s;ly, and I ordered them each a dram of liquor which for a while exhilerated their &s;pirits, and quieted their cares. The nar|rowne&s;s of the river, and the difficulty of
<PB N="146" REF="032239_0145_0FF19FD778650300">rowing from the &s;hoals, and fallen trees that thwarted the current, obliged us to lie too; we accordingly made fa&s;t an anchor, and lay with the two boats along &s;ide of each other, keeping a regular watch during the night. We furni&s;hed the &s;laves with provi|&s;ions, but whether through grief or &s;ullene&s;s, very few of them would partake of any refre&s;hments be&s;ide water.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as we had light we unmoored, and before noon we reached our &s;hallop, extremely fatigued from the heat and clo&s;e|ne&s;s of the air, the banks of each &s;ide as we pa&s;&s;ed, being overgrown with wood and thicket, ob&s;tructing its free circulation. We had now another di&s;agreeable piece of duty to execute, viz. the removal of the &s;laves from the &s;mall boats into the &s;hallop; they were in want of room, and it was &s;ugge&s;ted to loo&s;e &s;ix of them at a time; we accord|ing moved to the centre of the river, and being moored by a grapling, began to remove them; they appeared generally more quiet,
<PB N="147" REF="032239_0146_0FF19FDA66A74768">and willing to act as we directed by the inter|preter than u&s;ual, and had now all been removed, and placed below, but the la&s;t &s;ix, whom we &s;uffered to remain on the deck; when we had not under weigh, and were pa&s;&s;ing through a narrow part of the river, two of them found means to jump overboard; a &s;ailor who was in the &s;mall boat a&s;tern, &s;eized one of them by the arms, and the end of a rope being thrown to him, the &s;lave was taken on board, though not without &s;ome difficulty. The others who had been at the oars, &s;eeing their fellows, one of them &s;eized, and the other &s;truck on the head with a pole, &s;et up a &s;cream, which was echoed by the re&s;t below; tho&s;e that were loo&s;e made an effort to throw two of the &s;ailors over board; the re&s;t, except the one in the boat and at the helm, being a&s;leep: the noi&s;e had now rou&s;ed them, and the &s;cream had impre&s;&s;ed them with &s;ome degree of terror; they &s;ezied on the guns and bayonets that lay ready, and ru&s;hed upon the &s;laves, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> of whom from below had got loo&s;e, and
<PB N="148" REF="032239_0147_0FF19FDBF4FB7DE8">were endeavouring to &s;et the re&s;t free, while tho&s;e we had to deal with above, were threat|ening to &s;acrifice us to their de&s;pair. The&s;e tran&s;actions were but the events of a moment; I had neither gun nor &s;word, and to retire in &s;earch of either, would have been to give the &s;laves a deci&s;ive &s;uperiority; I laid hold of the <HI>palloon</HI> &s;tick, and had rai&s;ed it to &s;trike one of them who had nearly wre&s;ted a gun from one of the &s;ailors, but before I could give the blow, I received a &s;troke of an oar, which &s;evered my little finger from my hand; I know not how it was that I felt nothing of the &s;evere pain for the moment, a &s;light twitch on the hand was the only &s;en&s;ation I experienced; the blow was broken that I had intended, but I renewed the effort, and with effect, for I levelled the fellow, and the &s;ailor recovered his gun, whom I could not prevent from running the poor negro through the body; the hatch was open, and he fell among his fellows, who had, crouded tied, and ironed as they were, to a&s;&s;i&s;t as far as they were able, by holding our legs,
<PB N="149" REF="032239_0148_0FF19FDD8DC9A9C0">encouraging their companions, and &s;houting whenever tho&s;e above did any thing that appeared likely to overcome one or other of us. We at length overpowered them; one only having e&s;caped and one being killed, the re&s;t we immediately bound in double irons, and took care from thence till our arrival at the &s;hip, not to &s;uffer any of them to take the air without being made fa&s;t. Five of the &s;ailors were con&s;iderably, but not dangerou&s;ly hurt, and of the &s;laves, tho&s;e who had been riotous above and below, nine were &s;everely wounded.</P>
<P>We reached the &s;hip in five days from our fir&s;t embarkation, where we were received with much &s;atisfaction; the officers had all provided them&s;elves with three or four wives each, and rebuked me for not bring|ing mine along, alledging that they would, according to the account given by their me&s;&s;|mates, bring a good price when we arrived in America. I was &s;orry, however, to find that two of our be&s;t &s;eamen had expired
<PB N="150" REF="032239_0149_0FF19FE35A9CFD00">during my ab&s;ence, from the exce&s;&s;ive fatigue of the &s;hips duty, and the heat of the climate.</P>
<P>While I was away, the Captain had opened a trade in another channel, he had obtained <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 word"> &s;laves in the place where he lay, be&s;ide gold and ivory; and had contracted with &s;ome French and Engli&s;h factors up the river <HI>Reyo Naunus,</HI> for the remainder of his cargo, and for his &s;ea &s;tores. We accordingly weighed anchor and &s;tood for that river, which lies about 40 leagues N. of the <HI>Reyo Pongo,</HI> or in 10 deg. 40 min. &s;outh, and on the 16th. of May arrived off the Cape, which forms one &s;ide of the &s;outhern outlet of that river.</P>
<P>The <HI>Reyo Naunus</HI> is navigable above 150 miles from its mouth; its banks are low, fertile, and moderately inhabited, but within a few miles of the &s;ea; for, advancing far|ther into the country it is &s;wampy, unwhole|&s;ome, and uninhabited for &s;eventy or eighty miles above; beyond which, the ground again obtains its elevation, &s;o that health and
<PB N="151" REF="032239_0150_0FF19FE66101E7C8">population are &s;een in union with a luxuriant country, and a plea&s;ant climate. Here the factors of European nations have e&s;tabli&s;hed a &s;ettlement, and lead a life of heedle&s;s extra|vagance and di&s;&s;ipation. The American and European traders to this country, &s;upply them with all the luxurious produce of the world, with wines, jewellery, and co&s;tly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="3 letters">thing. The produce of their gardens, uniting the productions of every climate by being maintained at a great expence of negro labour, is obtained in great perfection by a few, and in abundance by all. Although a plenteous climate and limitted &s;ociety, ren|ders ho&s;pitality &s;carcely prai&s;eworthy, and although every individual, even of mode|rate property, &s;upports his own e&s;tabli&s;hment, of hou&s;e, gardens, hor&s;es, and &s;laves; the&s;e &s;ettlers unque&s;tionably de&s;erve notice, for among them ho&s;pitality exi&s;ts, in a degree unknown in other countries.</P>
<P>The Captain and I on our arrival, went on &s;hore to lay in &s;tock and water, but had
<PB N="152" REF="032239_0151_0FF19FE9529D3A70">contemplated returning as &s;oon as we &s;hould have engaged with &s;ome per&s;on to &s;upply us; we were met, however, and invited to the hou&s;e of an Engli&s;hman, who had once fol|lowed the &s;ea; he entreated us to &s;pend the day with him, and that in the meantime, our bu&s;ine&s;s could be done by ordering what we wi&s;hed from his hou&s;e. It was early, and we were provided with a &s;umptuous breakfa&s;t of chocolate, tea and coffee, ele|gantly &s;erved up in beautiful China and plate, with fruits of various kinds in gla&s;s ware. Several of the neighbouring factors joined us, and appeared jealous of our accidentally becoming gue&s;ts of one and not of the other; however, that the &s;ociety of the place &s;hould be kept up, they agreed (without a&s;king our con&s;ent) that we &s;hould &s;pend a day with each of them, in order. We objected to this exce&s;&s;ive liberality, but were obliged to &s;tay dinner with one, and &s;up with another, to take a bed with a third, and a gla&s;s of wine <HI>en pa&s;&s;ant,</HI> with half a dozen more; we were conducted to the gardens that I have
<PB N="153" REF="032239_0152_0FF19FEC44E5B150">before noticed, and heard the anecdotes of the &s;everal plantations, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions from the fir&s;t &s;ettlement. As the heat of the day increa&s;ed we retired, and the &s;acrifices to Bacchus commenced, with what they called a <HI>whetter</HI> before dinner. Some of our com|pany, however, had been rather earlier at their devotions;&mdash;but as the minutiae of the <HI>two</HI> days which we were obliged to &s;pend with them, would be tedions, a general de&s;cription of their cu&s;toms and mode of life, will be more &s;uitable and comprehen&s;ive.</P>
<P>The&s;e factors mo&s;tly con&s;i&s;t of per&s;ons who have led a &s;eafaring life, but being left in the country either by de&s;ign or accident, have gradually become attached to the indo|lence and indulgence which the climate affords. The woods, the rivers, and the labours of the Africans, afford all that luxury can require for the table, and trade &s;upplies the re&s;t. One of them, John Stone by name, who&s;e hou&s;e we had fir&s;t entered, was from the north ea&s;t of England, and
<PB N="154" REF="032239_0153_0FF19FEF432E4138" MS="y">had re&s;ided at the <HI>Colong</HI> about 8 or 10 years. He had at fir&s;t &s;ight, (the&s;e were his words) attached him&s;elf to me partially, and took much pains to induce me to remain there, pointing out the advantages that I &s;hould derive from being the only American in the &s;ettlement, and the independence I would &s;peedily acquire by trade in the interior, from the experience in that line which he learned I already had. The&s;e temptations offered in the moments of hilarity made but a feeble impre&s;&s;ion on me, and the laxity of manners and intoxication that I &s;aw, did not appear &s;o much the effect of common and general cu&s;tom, as of a &s;uppo&s;ed de&s;ire of the&s;e &s;ettlers, to contribute to the comfort and plea&s;ure of per&s;ons who had partaken of none, but the few enjoyments of an adven|turous life, for a long time previous.</P>
<P>But I propo&s;ed de&s;cribing their way of life, I need not remark on the cu&s;tomary plu|rality of women in the dome&s;tic e&s;tabli&s;h|ment, but will only ob&s;erve that the whites
<PB N="155" REF="032239_0154_0FF19FF22FFDB0B8">adopt this fa&s;hion of the country in all its extent; the morning beverage of Madeira or Li&s;bon wines, &s;piritous liquors, or the more palatable <HI>liqueurs</HI> of the <HI>belle nation,</HI> circulate during the forenoon, which is devoted to vi&s;iting from hou&s;e to hou&s;e. The hour of dinner is that which fixes company to a point, as all keep open and ample boards; it is not &s;o much the que&s;tion whether they &s;hall all dine together, as with what parti|cular one that &s;hall be, and each per&s;on wi&s;hing to be the favoured man, the be&s;t accommodation has generally the preference, which makes every one emulous to have the mo&s;t tempting viands and agreeable fare. This &s;pirit &s;o liberal in appearance, is yet not the effect of an amiable pa&s;&s;ion, but rather the contrary, and the exce&s;&s;es of which, is the parent will, be perhaps the be&s;t te&s;t to prove its mi&s;chievous tendency.</P>
<P>The board is &s;carcely &s;pread, and the gue&s;ts &s;eated when the <HI>debauch</HI> begins; for their behaviour is unte&s;trained by that ta&s;te for
<PB N="156" REF="032239_0155_0FF19FF3C21B7590">decorum which is always in&s;pired by the &s;ociety of amiable and accompli&s;hed women, while the rudene&s;s of the conver&s;ation is generally a&s;&s;orted with the uncourteous way of life, to which the company has been habi|tuated. They come to the table nearly intoxicated, and before dinner is completed, they become downright drunk; the vacancy which marks the uncultivated mind, afford|ing no room here for u&s;eful conver&s;ation or agreeable hilarity, folly and wantonne&s;s &s;upply their place. The coar&s;e jocularity of de&s;troying their apparel or wa&s;ting the food, is their amu&s;ement; while the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite viands are wa&s;ted without utility, and the appetite being palled by &s;uperabundance, lo&s;es all its value but that which gratifies the vanity of the provider, by indulging the wa&s;te and ab&s;urdity of his gue&s;ts. After the wine has circulated freely, the meats are even occa&s;ionally da&s;hed about at the heads of the be&s;t humoured, or mo&s;t patient of the company, and the empty di&s;hes, plates, and tables are demoli&s;hed to &s;hew the &s;pirit of
<PB N="157" REF="032239_0156_0FF19FF56649F0E0">the party, and the lengths to which they could carry <HI>a joke.</HI></P>
<P>A man of high &s;pirit on an occa&s;ion of this kind, has been known to furni&s;h a &s;econd, and a third cour&s;e for a like entertainment, each of which met with a &s;imilar fate&mdash;and the whole was afterwards celebrated as a <HI>high frolic.</HI></P>
<P>At the conclu&s;ion of the&s;e debauches, the black wives who know their duty, attend and convey each exemplary ma&s;ter to his own hou&s;e. This, with the &s;imple variation of hunting, &s;hooting, and fi&s;hing parties, at particular &s;ea&s;ons, giving orders for the management of their gardens, their meals, and occa&s;ionally their traffic, is the round of life the white people lead in this &s;ettlement.</P>
<P>My landlord had contrived to acquire convertible property, to the amount of between 3 and 4000<ABBR>l.</ABBR> he had originally hoped to have returned to Europe, and
<PB N="158" REF="032239_0157_0FF19FFE03773CD0">&s;pend the remainder of his life happily, but he confe&s;&s;ed he did not then think he could be <HI>comfortable</HI> any where el&s;e, and had deter|mined to &s;tay where he was.</P>
<P>I had however, conceived different ideas of comfort, and though I could not &s;hun their noi&s;y and mad fe&s;tivity for the time, was convinced that if I po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the means which my ho&s;t then did, that I &s;hould find &s;cenes on the banks of the <HI>Hud&s;on</HI> or <HI>Dela|ware,</HI> where it could be converted to more rational and de&s;irable purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>As our cargo was now complete, and our &s;tock and water provided, &s;ufficient for the pa&s;&s;age home, it was high time to depart, which we did not without much ob&s;truction from our madly ho&s;pitable factors, and with aching heads and &s;ick &s;tomachs, not likely to let us &s;oon forget them.</P>
<P>Our entertainers determined to accompany us to the &s;hip, and the Captain with &s;ome
<PB N="159" REF="032239_0158_0FF19FFF90FB8CA8">others of the factors having taken one boat, my ho&s;t accompanied me in the other; on the way he took much trouble to per&s;uade me to leave the &s;hip and &s;tay with him, and offered me 300<ABBR>l.</ABBR> per annum to quit the &s;hip and keep his books. It was in vain that I told him I could not obtain a di&s;charge from the ve&s;&s;el, that all the accounts were kept in my hand writing, and that I was not &s;an|guine enough of advantage to induce me to &s;tay, even if I had the power; he &s;till conti|nued to urge his propo&s;al. I was however, indeed much allured on further reflection, by the knowledge I had of my own re&s;olution again&s;t a di&s;&s;ipated life, and particularly by the pro&s;pect of making a rapid fortune, &s;o much within my power, by my acquaintance with the <HI>Ebo</HI> King and people, and by the progre&s;s I had made in their language; &s;o much, that could the difficulties which I &s;aw in my way, be removed, I &s;hould have embraced the offer.</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="032239_0159_0FF1A0011E32DD90">
We reached the ve&s;&s;el, and with &s;uch rough fare as we po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, endeavoured to regale our vi&s;itors, who took leave of us with the evening, but not without a more pre&s;&s;ing invitation to me, to get on &s;hore.</P>
<P>We were now to prepare for &s;ea; our ve&s;&s;el lay nearly a mile from the &s;hore, and our cargo was all on board; but a very &s;evere di&s;temper already threatened the &s;laves; they had become &s;ullen and melan|choly, and di&s;contented with their food, and confinement. The air of the &s;hip, and the &s;cene before me, perhaps together with the remaining fumes of debauch on &s;hore, con|tributed to render me di&s;contented with my &s;ituation. I revolved in my mind that I had now di&s;charged my duty to the owners, that I had but a few entries to make to complete the accounts, and while the hope of fortune and the temptations of the Engli&s;h factor, pre&s;&s;ed upon my recollection; I determined finally, to fini&s;h my bu&s;ine&s;s, and embark in
<PB N="161" REF="032239_0160_0FF1A002B8BA9158">the enterprize that now occupied every turn of my mind.</P>
<P>The work being executed in the heat and enthu&s;ia&s;m of my re&s;olution; I had now to contrive the means of my departure. The Captain could not according to his articles, give me a di&s;charge, but this ob&s;tacle was only a &s;tronger in&s;tigation to per&s;evere in the attempt. Every per&s;on of the &s;hip's company but the Captain, Surgeon, and my&s;elf, had &s;tated duties in the watch, which from the arrival of the &s;laves, was con&s;tantly and rigdly kept up: the only boat not on board was chained a&s;tern, and this it would be impo&s;&s;ible to get clear without exciting alarm.</P>
<P>I had marked the advice of the factor, not to leave the &s;hip till on the verge of her departure; we had dropped down with the tide, and moored by the be&s;t bower and &s;tream anchor, in a fine &s;andy bottom, but the oppo&s;ite &s;hore was mar&s;hy: the next morn|ing
<PB N="162" REF="032239_0161_0FF1A005D0BFF2D8">was to be that of our departure. My determination to e&s;cape was confirmed by my accidentally &s;eeing as I pa&s;&s;ed the main hatch, one of the &s;laves in the pangs of death; the &s;ickne&s;s had already made con&s;iderable progre&s;s, and I was &s;truck with the danger that mu&s;t follow when out at &s;ea, as the di&s;|ea&s;e had already inflicted death.</P>
<P>My whole mind was now concentred on my e&s;cape, and I &s;oon prepared two bottles of &s;pirits to give the watch, after the Cap|tain &s;hould have gone to &s;leep: a few articles of linen, my be&s;t hat, and my hanger, I &s;et apart; and when all had retired, about ten at night I came upon deck, and offered the boat&s;wain, who commanded the watch, a can of grog, of which I knew him to be not a little fond; he freely &s;hared it with the re&s;t, and I was not backward in repleni&s;hing the quantity, which had its de&s;ired effect; for I then retired, and &s;oon after coming up with my things, found them all extended on the deck, and fa&s;t a&s;leep. I fixed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 span">
<PB N="163" REF="032239_0162_0FF1A00A2BEC5E98">on a plank which the carpenter had marke<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter"> out for the &s;cantling of a barricade, and l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="2 letters"> it down in the water by a rope's end; I the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="UOM" EXTENT="1 letter"> &s;tripped my&s;elf to all but my &s;hirt and trow|&s;ers, and committed my&s;elf to the water, intending to &s;wim to the &s;hore with the plank, and buoy my&s;elf up by it when I &s;hould feel fatigued. I meant to float a&s;tern, but from want of means to manage the plank, it had got entangled in the man ropes, I endeavoured to make for the boat, which with much diffi|culty, after having di&s;engaged my clothes and hanger, letting them go adrift, I effected. Per&s;i&s;ting in my purpo&s;e, I once more made the attempt; but the tide was now rapid, and I unfortunately &s;wept again&s;t the &s;tream cable, by which I was turned over, and &s;epa|rated from the plank. My only re&s;ource now was to adhere to the cable in order to get &s;afe on board if po&s;&s;ible, and after much difficulty, I got out of the water and clam|bered up to &s;ome di&s;tance: having re&s;ted for &s;ome time here, and the tide &s;lackening, I once more thought of committing my&s;elf
<PB N="164" REF="032239_0163_0FF1A00E7B4F0778">to the water and &s;wimming to &s;hore, when I di&s;covered by the occa&s;ional &s;cintillations of lightning, three or four aligators floating below me in the current; my blood was chilled, and I congratulated my&s;elf for the moment on my happy e&s;cape. I now concluded to make my way back on &s;hip|board as well as po&s;&s;ible, which having effected, I found my &s;hipmates all &s;till happy and heedle&s;s; and &s;lunk to my birth, cooled and fatigued, and ready for repo&s;e. On the morning as the anchors were about to be taken up, I was called to take the u&s;ual beverage which &s;eamen call their morning, but pleaded illne&s;s, and was waited on by the Doctor, to whom I without re&s;erve, but in confidence &s;tated the plain truth. He was much &s;urpri&s;ed, promi&s;ed &s;ecrecy, and fur|ni&s;hed me with &s;ome of his own clothes, in which I made my appearance upon deck, the Captain condoling with me upon my illne&s;s, which he &s;aid was vi&s;ible in my countenance, and expre&s;&s;ing his fears that I had caught the &s;ickne&s;s which had already killed &s;everal
<PB N="165" REF="032239_0164_0FF1A01010C6FBA0" MS="y">of the people; though I could with difficulty refrain from laughter, I was &s;atisfied to find all had gone &s;o far well.</P>
<P>We had now dropped down a con&s;iderable length, and I had nearly de&s;paired of effecting my e&s;cape, when accident threw an oppor|tunity in my way, that I directly embraced. It was found nece&s;&s;ary to take in &s;ome balla&s;t, and the boat&s;wain having &s;urfeited him&s;elf <HI>with watching</HI> the previous night, and was unable to go on &s;hore with the boat, I accord|ingly offered my &s;ervices; but had no oppor|tunity of taking any conveniencies with me, except a &s;mall cutla&s;s and jack knife. I determined upon effecting my purpo&s;e now once for all.</P>
<P>When we reached the &s;hore I &s;et the men to work, urging them to make ha&s;te, while I took a &s;hort walk along the bank, to return by the time they were ready, if not, for them to call me. In&s;tead of taking to the water &s;ide, I &s;oon got out of &s;ight of the boat's
<PB N="166" REF="032239_0165_0FF1A0131BD93DF0">crew, and made the be&s;t of my way inland from the water; but finding it was populous in that direction, I judged it better to take the &s;helter of &s;ome bru&s;h wood and high gra&s;s that was near. They hailed as directed, and I heard them; they &s;earched in all directions, and pa&s;&s;ed &s;everal times clo&s;e by me, calling my name, and at length returned concluding me lo&s;t or devoured by wild bea&s;ts. The Captain was extremely &s;ur|pri&s;ed to find the &s;ailors return without me, and determined to go on &s;hore him&s;elf that evening, and engage a party of the natives to go in &s;earch of me. I, in&s;en&s;ible, and un&s;u&s;pecting of this, had not &s;tirred before midnight from my covert, but having marked where the &s;un went down, &s;et forward from that direction, and travelled till daylight; having found plenty of fruit, I fea&s;ted, and cho&s;e a rece&s;s once more, and committed my&s;elf as I hoped, to &s;leep. The monkeys, however, were le&s;s civil than I had before found them, they collected in numbers about, and annoyed me by their ince&s;&s;ant &s;creaming
<PB N="167" REF="032239_0166_0FF1A01616B6E160">and chattering, which made me unea&s;y, as I feared that their noi&s;e would attract &s;ome of the natives to the place. To avoid this, I determined to move forward, and was accom|panied by this noi&s;y pe&s;tiferous crew, jump|ing from tree to tree before and on all &s;ides of me, crying louder if po&s;&s;ible, than before. Frequently did I, with the de&s;ire of revenge, wi&s;h for a gun that I might &s;acrifice &s;ome of them; but in the afternoon having obtained &s;ome quietne&s;s, I lay down to &s;leep; and about 9 o'clock pur&s;ued my route. Several pathways cro&s;&s;ing convinced me that the country was thickly peopled; I endeavoured to take that which was lea&s;t trodden, but &s;hortly after di&s;covored five per&s;ons cro&s;&s;ing the path which I was pur&s;uing, I changed my cour&s;e up an a&s;cent, and e&s;caped unno|ticed, but had not gone above a mile when I di&s;covered two others &s;omewhat ahead of me. The openne&s;s of the country now deprived me of &s;helter, for a few &s;cattered trees were all that this ri&s;ing ground afforded; the two men approaching, and I had placed
<PB N="168" REF="032239_0167_0FF1A017A4604950">my&s;elf behind a tree, &s;hifting my po&s;ition as they drew near&mdash;I thought they would have heard my heart beat as I &s;tood again&s;t the tree, &s;o great was my apprehen&s;ion; they pa&s;&s;ed me, however, and I turned into a path that led down into the woody country. I had plucked &s;ome fruit and &s;at down by a rivulet to refre&s;h my&s;elf, when fatigue and want of &s;leep overcame me, &s;o that I lay down under &s;helter of a bank. About mid|night, as I computed by the time I had been a&s;leep, I was awakened by violent claps of thunder, the lightning &s;treamed along the verge of the horizon, and illumined the hea|vens; the dark heaps of clouds, ri&s;ing volume over volume, di&s;played a variety of the mo&s;t &s;ublime &s;hadows, through the intervals of which, the coru&s;cations bur&s;t in a thou&s;and points, breaking into angles, and exploding in deep re&s;ounding peals that gradually were lo&s;t undulating on the ear, and this &s;till &s;uc|ceeded by another louder, and accompanied by a torrent that &s;eemed to pour from the heavens like the waters of a cataract. The
<PB N="169" REF="032239_0168_0FF1A01C097ED4F8">&s;torm began now to abate, and was faintly heard muttering at a di&s;tance; but the winds ro&s;e, the trees of the fore&s;t &s;hook, and in alter|nate moments was all horrible, awful, dark, and &s;till.&mdash;Drenched with rain and overcome with a depre&s;&s;ion, from the awful &s;cene that had pa&s;&s;ed, a momentary con&s;ideration of my pre&s;ent circum&s;tances, produced &s;en&s;a|tions that I cannot de&s;cribe; my eyes over|flowed with tears which ea&s;ed me of my anxiety, and I then felt an unconquerable propen&s;ity to &s;leep.</P>
<P>The day had been far &s;pent when I awoke; the heat of the &s;un was con&s;iderable; I &s;tripped off my dripping clothes, dried them, and bathed in the rivulet on the banks of which I had lain. Having collected a few fruit, and being further refre&s;hed, I deter|mined to pur&s;ue my route over the hill from which I had before de&s;cended; but found I had &s;uffered more than I previou&s;ly &s;u&s;pected by fatigue and by the rain: of this I was convinced by my weakne&s;s, and the length
<PB N="170" REF="032239_0169_0FF1A0205DC68730">of time employed in a&s;cending the hill. I took advantage of a few trees that &s;tood near each other to re&s;t my&s;elf, and &s;at down for about half an hour, when I was alarmed by the &s;ound of human voices. I ro&s;e up, and to my a&s;toni&s;hment &s;aw a body of the natives of about twenty, armed with fire arms and &s;pears, and within 100 yards of me. I was immediately &s;truck with an apprehen&s;ion that they were in pur&s;uit of me; but concluded that the &s;hip mu&s;t have &s;ailed before this time. I then felt a di&s;po|&s;ition to acco&s;t them; but &s;till undertermined I found my&s;elf creeping along towards the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the hill on all fours. As &s;oon as I conceived my&s;elf out of &s;ight I fled towards the valley with all the &s;peed in my power; but I fled in vain, I was di&s;covered, and to my a&s;toni&s;hment and alarm, three or four &s;hots fired after me. I redoubled my &s;peed; but the pur&s;uers were too fleet, and uncertain what fate awaited me, I turned &s;hort round and faced them; they &s;eized and were about to tie me; I endeavoured
<PB N="171" REF="032239_0170_0FF1A021E9228868">to make them under&s;tand what I had to &s;ay in the <HI>Ebo</HI> tongue without effect but by &s;igns informed them that I would go with|out-oppo&s;ition. They conducted me back by almo&s;t the &s;ame route I had come, guard|ing me clo&s;ely, and &s;ome of them occa&s;ionally &s;hewing the marks of my &s;hoes, by which I &s;uppo&s;e they had traced my cour&s;e. We arrived that night at a village, where I had a dry hut and plenty of rice &s;traw to &s;leep upon; a party was placed to watch me, but I was &s;upplied with food and palm wine&mdash;I &s;lept &s;oundly, but awoke feveri&s;h, and was obliged to ri&s;e early in that condition. I felt extremely weak, but determined to go whither&s;oever they led, provided my &s;trength &s;hould be &s;ufficient; to my &s;urpri&s;e, however, upon clearing a wood through which we pa&s;&s;ed, I &s;aw the &s;hip clo&s;e in by the &s;hore. Mixed emotions overcome me, and I fainted; on recovery I found the Captain, the Doctor, and &s;ome of the &s;hip's crew around me; the Captain received me with great coolne&s;s;
<PB N="172" REF="032239_0171_0FF1A024DB03D138">but the Doctor, the mate, and &s;ailors all with the greate&s;t cordiality.</P>
<P>Having arrived on board; the Captain upbraided me with de&s;erting him; I alledged in my defence that I had completed his bu&s;i|ne&s;s, and &s;ignified the apprehen&s;ions I enter|tained for my health; apprehen&s;ions which have &s;ince proved to my &s;orrow, were but too well founded. I did not he&s;itate to declare my expectations of &s;oon realizing a property, could I reach the <HI>Colong</HI> factory, and de&s;ired as the &s;hip's bu&s;ine&s;s was all brought up, that he would permit me to go thither in the be&s;t manner I could. He told me that there was yet further bu&s;ine&s;s to do, that he had &s;hipped in my ab&s;ence, an addi|tional number of &s;laves, brought to him down the <HI>Reyo Naunus,</HI> and that he could not agree to it, even had that bu&s;ine&s;s not interfered; finding it in vain to &s;trive far|ther again&s;t difficulties, I relinqui&s;hed my ideas of fortune, and reconciled my&s;elf to return home.</P>
<P><PB N="173" REF="032239_0172_0FF1A027E91209C0">
I was afterwards informed, that the Cap|tain had gone on &s;hore, finding me not return with the boat, and learned from the people of the next village that they had &s;een the foot&s;teps of an European in their neigh|bourhood on the preceding day; he accord|ingly hired 25 of the natives to go in one direction, and an equal number in the other, as they &s;aid I could only get out of that part of the country by two pa&s;&s;ages, owing to the large rivers then filling with the rains that had fallen on the inland mountains. The party that took me had di&s;covered my tracks, and pur&s;ued their cour&s;e till they overtook me, in con&s;equence of which, they received a runlet of rum as a reward.</P>
<P>The whole number of &s;laves that we had now on board, I found about 500, of whom above 50 were then lying in a dangerous &s;tate of illne&s;s; it was time for us to depart, being now the 13th. of June, 1795. We accordingly got in our anchors, and procured &s;ix of the natives boats, with &s;ix men in
<PB N="174" REF="032239_0173_0FF1A02AD9422408">each, to tow us down night and day, when the tide &s;erved.</P>
<P>On the morning of the 15th. while waiting for the tide, about 9 o'clock, we were alarmed on beard by a quarrel in the boats. Some of our people who had been on this coa&s;t before, had excited a &s;pirit of com|petition between the natives in the boats that towed on each of our bows; each party claiming the greater merit, to en&s;ure it, they proceeded from hard words to actual blows; the party offended had drifted a little a&s;tern, the others pre&s;erved their place; the offended now united their force, and rowed up to attack the aggre&s;&s;ors. The&s;e being pre&s;&s;ed, flew up the &s;ides of the &s;hip, and were pur&s;ued by the others, which made it time for us to interpo&s;e. Our only re&s;ource was to drive both parties over the &s;ides of the &s;hip, we were then &s;winging round, and it would be vain to expect further &s;ervice from the com|batants; all hands were, therefore, ordered to quarters, and the Captain directed he inter|preter
<PB N="175" REF="032239_0174_0FF1A02DC51400C8">to order them from off the deck, and the &s;hip's &s;ide, or we &s;hould fire upon them. They directly made to their boats, but a&s;&s;ailing each other with knives and other weapons: &s;ome of them, to e&s;cape, attempted to get in the cabin windows, where I was &s;tationed with two men, I di&s;charged a mu&s;ket over their heads, which &s;cared them &s;o that they jumped into the water; their boats were cut adrift, and the tide &s;erving, we left them in a warm conflict, wherein &s;everal mu&s;t have been killed.</P>
<P>We cleared the Capes without any fur|ther event worthy of notice, on the 17th June; the wind at S. E. we &s;teered a N. N. W. cour&s;e. From thence to the 27th. there was little to note, but the ordinary variations of wind and weather, except the increa&s;ed &s;everity of the di&s;order that raged on board; it was an inflammatory fever, attended with &s;ymptoms of dy&s;entery in &s;ome, but mo&s;tly with a violent inflammation and &s;welling of the eyes and eyelids, with a di&s;charge of
<PB N="176" REF="032239_0175_0FF1A030B3C3FFB8">fetid rheum. The &s;laves were almo&s;t uni|formly afflicted with this di&s;order in the eyes, even more than had been &s;eized with the dy&s;entery. Both di&s;ea&s;es &s;oon communicated to the crew, and by the 30th. of June, we had &s;carcely men enough to work the &s;hip.</P>
<P>Hitherto by exerci&s;e and an open air, by keeping con&s;tantly on deck, refraining as much from &s;alt food as po&s;&s;ible, and by fre|quent bathing on board, I had kept my&s;elf in perfect health, though in con&s;tant terror, from the frequent deaths of the &s;laves, and the &s;ickne&s;s of the crew around me.</P>
<P>On the 1&s;t. of July, I found my precau|tions had not availed, and the goodne&s;s of my con&s;titution not &s;ufficient to &s;upport me again&s;t the prevailing di&s;ea&s;e any longer. The fever attacked me, and my eyes &s;welled to &s;uch a degree that I could &s;carcely open them, my &s;pirits, however, &s;till kept me up, and after the eleventh day I began to reco|ver: on the 20th. I could go upon deck,
<PB N="177" REF="032239_0176_0FF1A033BB83F640">and continued to do &s;o, regaining my &s;trength hourly. Early on the morning of the 24th: a ve&s;&s;el of war hove in &s;ight, and as we had heard on the coa&s;t of Africa, that war was expected between the United States and Great Britain, we were much alarmed le&s;t it &s;hould prove a Briti&s;h man of war.</P>
<P>The crew were divided in opinion regard|ing the &s;hips form, &s;ome a&s;&s;erting that &s;he was not a Briti&s;h ve&s;&s;el; I took the gla&s;s, intending to &s;atisfy my&s;elf and &s;ettle the di&s;|pute, and went forward;&mdash;I &s;aw that the &s;hip carried the Briti&s;h colours, but alas! I had &s;trained my &s;ight, and never &s;aw more. The inflammation returned, a relap&s;e took place, and the light of the &s;un became to my eyes, as indi&s;tinct and dark as the gloom of death; the beauties of nature to me were "blotted out for ever," and in my 23d. year, when I looked forward to days of ea&s;e and comfort, from the re&s;ources of my activity and indu&s;try&mdash;my path is &s;hut up, and the
<PB N="178" REF="032239_0177_0FF1A036C20011D8">world become a blank of indi&s;tinctne&s;s and uncertainty.</P>
<P>A termination of this kind to the voyage, could afford me neither amu&s;ement nor com|fort, for upon reaching my native country, and returning to my once cheerful home, the reader will ea&s;ily conceive how melan|choly mu&s;t the impre&s;&s;ion have been, which my misfortunes had made on my friends and family; and how &s;orely I was di&s;tre&s;&s;ed by the want of &s;ight, and its invaluable and con&s;oling ble&s;&s;ings.</P>
<P>But it becomes man to &s;ubmit to that range of toward or untoward circum&s;tances, which is the birthright of his being&mdash;to per&s;evere calmly and bear patiently with the changes of fortune, and the &s;hocks of black adver&s;ity; If he be fortuate, never let him be too con|fident that he is placed beyond the reach of affliction,&mdash;and he will thus be always wil|ling
<PB N="179" REF="032239_0178_0FF1A039ADCA7150">to act the <HI>man,</HI> and able to &s;tem the torrent of misfortune, though equal to that which I now &s;u&s;tain.</P>
