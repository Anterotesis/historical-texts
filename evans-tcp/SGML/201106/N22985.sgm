<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHATEVER may be the execu|tion of the little performance which I have the honour to pre&s;ent to your lord&s;hip, it will derive &s;ome merit, I am per&s;uaded, in your lord&s;hip's &s;ight, from the good meaning wherewith it was writ|ten, from its &s;uitablene&s;s to my profe&s;&s;ion, and from the importance of its &s;ubject. Perhaps too, its author's undi&s;&s;embled re|&s;pect for your lord&s;hip may give it &s;ome additional value; for true re&s;pect, we are a&s;&s;ured, can give value to the &s;malle&s;t of|ferings from the hands of the poore&s;t.</P>
<P>But, indeed, I did not know to whom I could, with greater propriety, in&s;cribe a work of this nature, than to a nobleman, who&s;e regular life, and punctual di&s;charge of all the &s;ocial duties mu&s;t render <HI>Reflec|tions

<P>From hence, my lord, we are encourag|ed to promi&s;e the faire&s;t days to good let|ters and good manners:&mdash;They can|not but flouri&s;h under your di&s;cerning eye, and the fo&s;tering patronage of our belov|ed MONARCH; in who&s;e un&s;ullied virtues, while his people felicitate them&s;elves, no grateful man can be in&s;en&s;ible of the ho|nour, which redounds to the illu&s;trious per|&s;on, who had &s;o con&s;iderable a &s;hare in forming the royal mind to virtue; and in|&s;piring it with tho&s;e great, ju&s;t, and patriot &s;entiments, which have obtained to our &s;o|vereign, from his &s;ubjects, that mo&s;t honor|able of all appellations,&mdash;the Good.</P>
<P>Happy in your PRINCE'S favour, my lord, and happy in the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of your own integrity, you will go on to de|&s;erve and to obtain the e&s;teem and affec|tion of all men of &s;cience, of virtue, and religion. So will your name be placed high in that temple of true glory, where

<P>Full three&s;core years and ten had BU|BULO encumbered with his heavy load, this &s;ublunary world; and it would be difficult to point out any works of benevo|lence or religion, any works of real worth or humanity, which di&s;tingui&s;hed the&s;e &s;e|venty years. Fond of vile pelf, the earth|worm continually toiled to add to his heap; and though rich, and daily encrea|&s;ing in wealth, could never prevail upon him&s;elf to communicate of his riches to others, or to &s;erve his neare&s;t relations.

<P>The hours which were not devoted to gain, were con&s;ecrated to the &s;ervice of his nice and enormous appetite, to de|vouring of fle&s;h, and drinking of wine.

<P>A long and wa&s;ting illne&s;s warned him of eternity:&mdash;he would not receive the warning. He dreaded death, yet would not prepare to die.

I beg of you to con&s;ider whether you do or not, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, re&s;emble tho&s;e unhappy children of ELI, whom, though they were famous in their generation, and men of renown, yet vengeance &s;uffered not to live. For my part, I may &s;afely u&s;e the expo&s;tulation of the old prie&s;t:&mdash;"Why do you &s;uch things?" for I hear of your evil doings by all this people.

<P>No man living can have a higher regard for be|nevolence and humanity than the writer of the&s;e lines: but he thinks benevolence to the <HI>&s;oul</HI> of a much higher nature than that of the body; and would be far from leading tho&s;e who are treading the in&s;idious paths of plea&s;ure with too eager de|light, into delu&s;ive and dangerous opinions, as if tenderne&s;s of heart, and acts of charity, could atone for every other deficiency. Di&s;&s;ipated and fond of plea&s;ure as we are, little need is there to encourage men in &s;o fal&s;e a pur&s;uit. It is hoped, therefore, that the writer of NASH'S life, (who he is, I know not,) in a future edition, would &s;trike out that of|fen&s;ive and hurtful pa&s;&s;age, which every &s;incere Chri&s;tian mu&s;t di&s;approve, wherein he a&s;&s;erts,&mdash; "That there was nothing criminal in his (NASH'S) conduct:&mdash;that he was a <HI>harmle&s;s</HI> creature, who&s;e greate&s;t vice was <HI>vanity,</HI>&mdash;and that &s;carce a <HI>&s;ingle action</HI> of his life, except one, de&s;erves the <HI>a&s;perity</HI> of <HI>reproach.</HI>" And this is &s;aid of a man, who, with a heart of exqui&s;ite humanity, and which might have been moulded into the noble&s;t form,&mdash;was yet, through life, a game&s;ter profe&s;t, and an encoura|ger of illegal gambling!&mdash;a follower of plea&s;ure all his days, and a perpetual di&s;&s;ipater!&mdash;and who&s;e conver&s;ation was made up of trifling, of fal&s;hood, and of immorality!</P>
<P>In matters which concern the &s;ouls of men, let us be e&s;pecially careful; for fatal, indeed, may it be to betray them into wrong opinions. In other re&s;pects we will unite to applaud Mr. NASH, and will readily join his Panegyri&s;ts;&mdash;we will be thankful to him for the improvements he has made at <HI>Bath,</HI> by his means the mo&s;t elegant and plea|&s;ing of all public places; and we will be thankful to the editor of his life, for the amu&s;ement and &s;a|tisfaction we have received from &s;o well-wrote and entertaining a performance.</P></NOTE> &amp;c.</SIGNED></CLOSER>

<P>We may well believe that a &s;ervant with &s;uch notions, mu&s;t be uniform and excel|lent in his whole conduct. And &s;uch in|deed was PETRUCIO.

<P>The fruits of his fidelity were the con|fidence and e&s;teem of his ma&s;ter and mi&s;|tre&s;s; the affection of the family; the reverence of his fellow-&s;ervants; and a comfortable &s;aving, on which he propo&s;ed

<P>During the time of his la&s;t &s;ickne&s;s, he frequently declared that the tenderne&s;s and regard of his ma&s;ter and mi&s;tre&s;s to him, more than overbalanced the merit of all his former &s;ervices, and were an abund|ant recompence to him.
