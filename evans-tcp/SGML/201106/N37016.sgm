<HEAD>TO THE AUTHOR OF <HI>REFLECTIONS ON PEACE.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>M.....</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>A PAMPHLET has ju&s;t been reprinted here, which every per&s;on of ta&s;te attributes to you, and which no one can read without re&s;pecting its author. Your wi&s;hes are for peace, and you would per&s;uade the allied Powers not to &s;cruple purcha&s;ing it by very important conce&s;&s;ions. In your wi&s;hes all Europe will unite; but many, I believe, will think, with me, that the means which you propo&s;e for accompli&s;hing them would be productive of the mo&s;t dangerous con&s;equences. It is con&s;oling to &s;ee the milder af|fections &s;till cheri&s;hed in the bo&s;om of one of the &s;exes, while every thought of the other &s;eems bent on de&s;truction; but yet, a great deal too much is at &s;take to allow its being &s;acrificed to the impatience of an exce&s;&s;ive &s;en&s;ibility, who&s;e triumph could only be preparatory to the bittere&s;t regret.</P>
<P>I am too confident, perhaps, in entering the li&s;ts again&s;t one who unites the &s;eduction of &s;entiment peculiar to her own &s;ex, with a courage in her political remarks which might rather be expected in the other,
<PB N="2" REF="048483_0003_10252F41EDADB9C0">
and embelli&s;hes both with hereditary eloquence. But truth and facts are the be&s;t &s;upport of an argument, and will make up for any other di&s;parity between the di&s;putants.</P>
<P>My purpo&s;e I hope will not be mi&s;taken. Indeed it will &s;oon appear that we really have both the &s;ame object; for who is there &s;o unfeeling as not anxiou&s;ly to wi&s;h for peace? not indeed a &s;u&s;picious and tem|porary &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of war, di&s;gui&s;ed under that name; but a peace equitable and durable, more &s;o than can po&s;&s;ibly be obtained by any conce&s;&s;ions on the part of the Allies.</P>
<P>Meaning to confine my ob&s;ervations to the actual &s;ituation, and the pro&s;pects of the contending Powers, I &s;hall &s;ay nothing of the picture which you have &s;ketched with &s;o much &s;pirit of the errors of the Coalition again&s;t France; but merely ob&s;erve, that the view you exhibit of the errors committed by the combined Powers, will rather induce them to avoid &s;uch conduct in future, than tempt them to repeat it.</P>
<P><Q>I could wi&s;h to think &s;o (you may &s;ay); but, admitting that pa&s;t errors do not nece&s;&s;arily lead to new di&s;grace, if you would intere&s;t us in the &s;ucce&s;s of the Allies, we mu&s;t fir&s;t know exactly what u&s;e they will make of it. Will they again think of di&s;membering France, of compelling an uncon|ditional &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the ancient &s;y&s;tem, and cha&s;|ti&s;ing tho&s;e who de&s;troyed it? Will they again propo&s;e to bring back the emigrants in triumph to Paris, with their terrible train of vengeance, exclu&s;ive privileges, feudal rights, and partial taxation?</Q></P>
<P>All &s;uch ideas the events of the war have long &s;ince &s;hewn to be vi&s;ionary. For a long time the object has been to &s;ave Germany from being di&s;|membered; and to prevent the aggrandi&s;ement, in|&s;tead of attempting the partition, of France. The
<PB N="3" REF="048483_0004_10252F53D34C79B8">
object has been to compel it to give back its con|que&s;ts, and to keep &s;o de&s;tructive a torrent within its proper limits: and, as probably the happine&s;s and peace of a century to come will principally depend on the equitable termination of the pre&s;ent conte&s;t, if the French cannot be conquered in the field, yet &s;till the war &s;hould be continued till ab&s;olute want com|pels them to retire within their ancient boundaries.</P>
<P>You appear to believe that a <HI>formal acknowledgement</HI> of their Republic would remove all difficulties, di&s;|&s;ipate their fears, and lead to a general re&s;titution; and you think that the Briti&s;h Cabinet per&s;i&s;ts in wa&s;ting the blood and trea&s;ure of the nation, merely to &s;ave the Kings of Europe from the humiliation of &s;uch a decla|ration. Perhaps you have not heard that three months ago<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">January 26, 1795.</NOTE> Mr. Pitt him&s;elf moved and carried the following re&s;olution in the Hou&s;e of Commons: <Q>That, under the pre&s;ent circum&s;tances, the Hou&s;e of Commons feels it&s;elf called upon to declare its determination firmly and &s;teadily to &s;upport his Maje&s;ty in the vigorous pro&s;ecution of the pre&s;ent ju&s;t and nece&s;&s;ary war, as affording, at this time, the only rea&s;onable expectation of permanent &s;e|curity and peace to this country: and that, for the attainment of the&s;e objects, this Hou&s;e relies with equal confidence on his Maje&s;ty's intention to em|ploy vigorou&s;ly the force and re&s;ources of the country, in &s;upport of its e&s;&s;ential intere&s;ts; and on the de&s;ire uniformly manife&s;ted by his Maje&s;ty, to effect a pacification on ju&s;t and honourable grounds, <HI>with any Government in France, under whatever form,</HI> which &s;hall appear capable of maintaining the ac|cu&s;tomed relations of peace and amity with other countries.</Q></P>
<P>Such has been, and &s;uch &s;till is, the language of Mr. Pitt. But though you have &s;aid a great deal of
<PB N="4" REF="048483_0005_10252F74C87C5D00">
that Mini&s;ter in your work, I &s;hall &s;ay very little of him in mine. No one has le&s;s occa&s;ion for an offi|cious defender than he; and I do not &s;ee the u&s;e of con|fining &s;o general a que&s;tion, and, when all other pa&s;&s;ions are &s;o dangerou&s;ly agitated, increa&s;ing the mi&s;chief by any per&s;onal reflections.</P>

<HEAD>CHAPTER I.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Whether the War has really been more di&s;a&s;trous to the confederated Powers, than Neutrality would have been? Whether they ought to accede to any &s;ort of Treaty, which would leave the French in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;malle&s;t part of their Conque&s;ts? and whether the Chances of obtaining Re&s;titution, and of ultimate Succe&s;s in the pre&s;ent Conte&s;t, are not in favour of that Party which has the mo&s;t permanent Re|&s;ources?</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>BEFORE any di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the principal point in di&s;pute, it will be convenient to di&s;entangle it from &s;ome que&s;tions which have a tendency to perplex it.</P>
<P>I do not mean (any more than M&mdash;) <HI>to go back to the origin of the war,</HI> or to inve&s;tigate its ju&s;tice on the part of the two Princes who fir&s;t united in &s;upport of monarchy in France: I am afraid there is but too much rea&s;on to believe that it has con|tributed to lead to the &s;caffold the King, whom they wi&s;hed to confirm on his throne, and to make tho&s;e very principles triumphant, which they intended to exterminate.</P>
<P>But, whatever may be thought of preceding cir|cum&s;tances, it cannot be denied that Great Britain did not join the confederacy, until the principles of Anarchy were triumphant in France; until that nation
<PB N="6" REF="048483_0007_10252FB351A3ABB8">
had avowed its project of di&s;&s;eminating them univer|&s;ally, and until it had actually commenced ho&s;tilities again&s;t States with which Great Britain had defen&s;ive alliances. In ju&s;tice to the Briti&s;h Government, this circum&s;tance ought not to be overlooked; nor &s;hould we judge of <HI>the policy of its conduct, by the bad &s;uc|ce&s;s which has hitherto attended it;</HI> but by the actual &s;ituation of Europe, at the time when this country acceded to the confederacy; when the people were generally taught to look upon the French Revolution as reali&s;ing every airy vi&s;ion of political happine&s;s; while in truth it menaced mankind with a far more dreadful &s;courge than that under which we now &s;uffer. We &s;hould revert to the time when, in very many countries, the people &s;eemed advancing, from admiration of the French theories, to an impatience for putting them in practice. If, at &s;o dangerous a moment, there were State&s;men cool enough to re&s;i&s;t the general enthu&s;ia&s;m, who fore&s;aw the inevitable con&s;equence of tho&s;e theories, and, in order to pre|vent it, adopted the bold mea&s;ure of drawing on their country towards an evil, di&s;tre&s;&s;ing no doubt, but neither unu&s;ual, nor without remedy, with a view to &s;ave it from the irreparable mi&s;chief of revo|lutionary anarchy&mdash;State&s;men wi&s;e enough to rou&s;e that popular zeal in defence of &s;ocial order, which el&s;e might have been &s;educed to &s;ubvert it; perhaps the gratitude of future ages will be in proportion to the courage with which they have dared to oppo&s;e the clamours of the day.</P>
<P>The Author of the <HI>Reflections on Peace,</HI> however, bit|terly reproaches them for not knowing how to avoid the &s;courge of revolutionary principles, but by the &s;courge of war, in&s;tead of <HI>lowering all their &s;ails during the &s;torm.</HI> But before we decide whether it was be&s;t boldly to bear up again&s;t it, or to let the ve&s;&s;el drive before it, at the mercy of the waves, the bur&s;ting out of the &s;torm &s;hould be con&s;idered. This
<PB N="7" REF="048483_0008_10252FBCEEA16890">
&s;ame writer calls it <HI>a new aera.</HI> It was indeed a time, when an unheard-of and mo&s;t dangerous doc|trine was zealou&s;ly propagated with a &s;ort of philo|&s;ophic parade, which fa&s;cinated many even of the thinking part of the world; and when con&s;e|quently it became the duty of tho&s;e who fore&s;aw the mi&s;chief, to give a contrary direction to popular enthu&s;ia&s;m. If this &s;o-much-blamed war, for which the French gave &s;uch ju&s;tifying provocation, or, if you in&s;i&s;t upon it, &s;o &s;pecious a pretence, has kept their neighbours under the re&s;traint of law, prevented turbulence by giving employment, and &s;trengthened the exi&s;ting governments, by uniting in their defence tho&s;e active &s;pirits, which el&s;e might have been united for their de&s;truction:&mdash;if, which is indi&s;|putable, this political pe&s;tilence has already co&s;t France ten times more lives than all the nations of Europe together have lo&s;t, in defending them&s;elves from it by war:&mdash;but beyond all other con&s;idera|tions, if the Briti&s;h Con&s;titution has triumphed, and will de&s;cend unchanged to po&s;terity;&mdash;I am con|vinced that future ages will look on the &s;acrifices of the pre&s;ent day, as <HI>&s;ignal benefits.</HI>&mdash;Bloody they are, no doubt, and calamitous; but infinitely le&s;s &s;o than the <HI>poi&s;oned pre&s;ent</HI> of the revolutionary &s;y&s;tem which the French have offered to the world.</P>
<P>If it is &s;aid that the nations which have not made &s;uch bloody &s;acrifices to internal tranquillity, have neither felt the mi&s;chiefs of war, nor been infected with this revolutionary contagion; I would a&s;k what advantages tho&s;e nations which are within the gra&s;p of France have found, from a di&s;po&s;ition to neutrality? Was it any &s;ecurity to Savoy, Holland, or the Palatinate? But waving what might be &s;aid re&s;pecting them, I wi&s;h to con&s;ider what has really been the &s;ituation of tho&s;e other neutral States (&s;o exclu&s;ively <HI>fortunate</HI>) to which the war has not reached, who&s;e <HI>wi&s;dom and happine&s;s</HI> is &s;o greatly
<PB N="8" REF="048483_0009_10252FCCB0C1AC98">
extolled; and which are &s;et up as patterns of the only line of conduct which the belligent Powers &s;hould have adopted, and as in&s;tances of the profound &s;ecurity which would have been the con&s;equence.</P>
<P>Next to Denmark, the Author of the <HI>Reflections on Peace</HI> mentions <HI>Sweden,</HI> which, we are told, <HI>owes its tranquillity to the &s;y&s;tem of neutrality adopted by the prudence of the Regent.</HI> And yet, in the mid&s;t of this <HI>tranquil Neutrality,</HI> this very Regent has detected a <HI>Con&s;piracy,</HI> which he repre&s;ents as <HI>atrocious,</HI> and as having put the <HI>independence and the quiet of Sweden</HI> in imminent danger. Is it forgotten that, in claiming from the Court of Naples, the per&s;on accu&s;ed of contriving this con&s;piracy, the Regent of Sweden, in December 1793, repre&s;ented that, <HI>in this di&s;a&s;trous epoch, when Europe is agitated from one end to the other, the Courts of it ought to guard their common in|tere&s;ts more vigilantly than ever?</HI> It is whim&s;ical enough that the Regent of Sweden, &s;o much prai&s;ed for <HI>not</HI> having joined with the re&s;t of Europe, to <HI>guard vigilantly tho&s;e common intere&s;ts,</HI> &s;hould actually have addre&s;&s;ed this language to Naples, a Court which has made very con&s;iderable exertions in the com|mon cau&s;e. It is &s;till more &s;o, that a Prince who can plead it as an <HI>undeniable truth, that whoever protects traitors, expo&s;es him&s;elf to become the victim of their attempts,</HI> &s;hould be at the head of affairs in a country, which, if it has not actually given mi|litary a&s;&s;i&s;tance to the French Regicides, has at lea&s;t, in very many other re&s;pects, contributed largely to their re&s;ources. But what is more &s;trange than all is, that the kingdom, who&s;e <HI>tran|quil neutrality</HI> M&mdash; extolls &s;o much, is the only one which, during its Neutrality, has &s;een one of its Kings a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated, and an <HI>atrocious con&s;piracy</HI> contrived again&s;t his &s;ucce&s;&s;or.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I know that the whole of this con&s;piracy is not yet di&s;co|vered, or at lea&s;t has not been laid before the public: con&s;e|quently it is impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ay, how much of it is imputable to French principles; but who is bold enough to affirm that it would have taken place, even though the Regent had put the nation into a &s;tate of defence? or to congratulate her on the tranquillity of her neutrality?</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="048483_0010_10252FD555F31C30">But at lea&s;t, &s;ays M&mdash;, we mu&s;t acknowledge that the <HI>Americans</HI> are enriching them&s;elves by their neutrality. I admit it, and I am very far from bla|ming them; but if they profit by the lo&s;&s;es of the Old World, what a ri&s;k have they not run of being torn in pieces by its Anarchy! Among them too the Convention has &s;ent emi&s;&s;aries commi&s;&s;ioned to drive, if po&s;&s;ible, the Patriarch of the New World from his &s;enatorial chair. They failed, indeed, in completing their infernal work; but they &s;ucceeded too well in kindling a civil war, and obliging parents to arm again&s;t their children; while, at mo&s;t, the belligerent Powers of the Old World have only been obliged to arm again&s;t a foreign enemy. Who can conjecture what might have been the con&s;equences of this civil war, if Wa&s;hington had not been alive, to give energy to law, to unite and arm the body of American Pro|prietors, who, under his direction, readily &s;ubmitted to the painful duty of a fatiguing march again&s;t their mi&s;guided countrymen? In America they found the nece&s;&s;ity of pulling up by the roots the&s;e trees of pre|tended Liberty which French Anarchy was beginning to plant in its remote&s;t fore&s;ts. And yet we are coolly told <HI>that the neutral States have been very far from imitating the example of the French!</HI> and we are to infer, that a people &s;eparated from them by the Straits of Dover has been to blame for providing effectually again&s;t a contagion malignant enough to reach beyond the Atlantic! But when we &s;ee that France has repaid the &s;incere unarmed neutrality of the New World by in&s;tigating its inhabitants to po|litical &s;uicide, we may judge what would have been the fate of the governments in her vicinity, if they
<PB N="10" REF="048483_0011_10252FEFB2EAB2D0">
had remained unarmed and unprepared for re&s;i&s;tance. Yet, by a &s;trange inju&s;tice, though in England every &s;editious movement has been ea&s;ily &s;uppre&s;&s;ed by a &s;light exertion of civil authority; and in America, neutral from intere&s;t and upon principle, the Go|vernment has been forced to rai&s;e on a &s;udden no le&s;s than 16000 men, to &s;uppre&s;s an in&s;urrection entirely owing to doctrines of anarchy di&s;&s;eminated by French emi&s;&s;aries; yet the Briti&s;h Cabinet, in the per&s;on of Mr. Pitt, is reproached <HI>with having per&s;uaded the people of property in England, that nothing but war could protect the Nation from the contagion of French politics.</HI></P>
<P>But (continues the author, page 8) has not Swi&s;|&s;erland, at the very doors of the French Revolution, avoided its introduction, and e&s;caped the horrors of war, by a prudent neutrality? No; it is certain that their di&s;po&s;ition to maintain peace would not have &s;aved them, but for the concurrence of &s;ome other very particular circum&s;tances. A war was actually undertaken again&s;t them, notwith&s;tanding their avowed neutrality, and they were at one time in the mo&s;t imminent danger. The French Republic had &s;ent po&s;itive orders to their General, Monte&s;quiou, to invade Swi&s;&s;erland; but this was prevented, in the fir&s;t in&s;tance, by the little State of Geneva, which adopted mea&s;ures of re&s;i&s;tance, and became a barrier between the army of the Alps and the Pays de Vaud, till the Helvetic Body had time to arm it&s;elf. The French General, too, had virtue enough to protract the execution of his orders, and &s;ucceeded in pro|curing them to be revoked; but not without deter|mining to ruin him&s;elf rather than decline repre|&s;enting to his employers <HI>the great inju&s;tice and the danger of the war which they were kindling.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>Let not France be di&s;honoured by an execrable abu&s;e of power. Will you &s;uffer the infancy of a Republic on which the eyes of the univer&s;e are fixed, to be polluted by the foul perfidy of Courts? Will you di&s;grace your darling country, by the &s;canda|lous repetition of the fable of the wolf and the lamb? Will it add to our honour, or to our power, to cru&s;h the feeble&s;t of our neighbours, to violate the &s;acred rules of univer&s;al ju&s;tice, and to plunge our&s;elves into an additional war?</Q> See <HI>A &s;hort Ac|count of the late Revolution in Geneva, printed for Elm&s;ley, Strand,</HI> 1795.</NOTE> And

the revolution to which Geneva voluntarily &s;ubmitted &s;oon after, took away their pretence for invading Swi&s;&s;erland. The deplorable fate of that intere&s;ting city is but too generally known, as well as the ini|quitous declaration in the Convention, which &s;aid, <Q>There mu&s;t be a Revolution in Geneva, or our own mu&s;t fail.</Q> We know that Swi&s;&s;erland, though by this time prepared for re&s;i&s;tance, had no way of avoiding a war but by withdrawing its troops from the neighbourhood of Geneva, and leaving it to its fate; and we know, too, that the pretended crime of that city was having procured it&s;elf <HI>to be included in the Helvetic Neutrality,</HI> which, &s;aid Bri&s;&s;ot, <HI>is nothing but an ill-di&s;gui&s;ed acce&s;&s;ion to the Coalition of Princes.</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Report to the Convention in the name of the Diplomatic Committee, the 21&s;t of December 1792, by Bri&s;&s;ot.</NOTE></P>
<P>Yet in &s;ight of this unfortunate city, which the French have polluted, by every atrocity of their own Revolution&mdash;clo&s;e to the gates of a city who&s;e <HI>Neutrality</HI> was its crime, a philo&s;ophic writer re|proaches other nations for not having tru&s;ted to a &s;imilar <HI>Neutrality!</HI></P>
<P>I am, however, convinced, that nothing but the exi&s;ting calamities of the war, could have led M&mdash; to lo&s;e &s;ight of the far more terrible calamities from which, in all probability, Europe has been pre&s;erved by it. Quite overjoyed to &s;ee the French Revolution all at once take &s;o moderate a turn, M&mdash; does not ob&s;erve that it is the war, which, by exhau&s;ting that nation, has brought it &s;o &s;oon to an epoch when the principles which led to it have lo&s;t their attraction,
<PB N="12" REF="048483_0013_1025301A06173828">
even with the French them&s;elves; and when they are as candid in avowing the di&s;a&s;trous con&s;equences of tho&s;e principles, as formerly they were zealous in trying to per&s;uade other nations, that the adoption of them would renovate the world, and re&s;tore the golden age.</P>
<P>Indeed there is now no longer any danger that other nations will be tempted to drink this political poi&s;on, from which France at pre&s;ent feels &s;uch fatal effects. They need no other warning again&s;t it than the following frightful, but the &s;alutary declaration of the very per&s;ons who, a few years &s;ince, were &s;o anxious in recommending it.</P>
<P><HI>France,</HI> &s;ays I&s;nard, <HI>has been drenched with blood, and inundated with tears.

<P>Certainly it required the hand of a ma&s;ter to give &s;o fini&s;hed a &s;ketch, in a few lines; and certainly no writer but a Frenchman would have omitted to add to this de&s;cription, an account of the cau&s;e of &s;o many horrors. The reader who wi&s;hes to know them may find them detailed in the third book of Thucydides&punc; from which the above de&s;cription is little el&s;e than an extract. He will ob&s;erve that Thucydides, in giving a frightful picture of the evils which Greece &s;uffered from an unlimited Democracy, po&s;itively declares that the &s;ame evils will con&s;tantly recur whenever an attempt is made to introduce a pure Democracy among a numerous people; wherever (to u&s;e the words of Freron) orators appear to recommend <HI>the magnificent enterprize of forming a Democracy of</HI> 25 <HI>millions of men.</HI></P></NOTE></P>

<P>Undoubtedly the&s;e are rea&s;ons why an imitation of the French Revolution need no longer be dreaded: but if from the&s;e declarations, which &s;o &s;trongly indi|cate that France is verging towards a regular govern|ment, we are to conclude, that becau&s;e the original object of the war is nearly attained, we &s;hould there|fore immediately propo&s;e a peace, in order that the new leaders of the French may be in a &s;ituation to effect the reforms which are nece&s;&s;ary; and that Europe may enjoy the quiet for which &s;he has been fighting, and which &s;he &s;o anxiou&s;ly de&s;ires;&mdash;To tho&s;e who argue in this way I an&s;wer, that, in the fir&s;t place, we ought to a&s;certain whether the new French leaders do &s;incerely wi&s;h for a general peace, and whether in fact they are not internally convinced that it will de&s;troy their authority. But, be&s;ides that they have never yet expre&s;&s;ed &s;uch a wi&s;h, even if they had expre&s;&s;ed it, the only pledge we can have of the &s;incerity of &s;uch profe&s;&s;ions, will be an offer to make a complete re&s;titution of their conque&s;ts.</P>
<P>This con&s;ideration leads to another not le&s;s impor|tant&mdash; Whether, even in that ca&s;e, any engagements made by the Girondi&s;t party, who once more take the lead, can be depended on? The author of this pam|phlet was one of tho&s;e who negociated and &s;igned, on the part of Geneva, the fir&s;t treaty made by the French Republic; and can give evidence from his own ex|perience, how little the good faith of that Republic, or any engagement entered into by its Girondi&s;t leaders, can be tru&s;ted. This very Faction, after giv|ing its Mini&s;ter full powers to negociate a treaty with the Geneve&s;e, waited till the latter had executed it on their part, and then coolly told them, <HI>they ought to have been aware that the only admi&s;&s;ible treaty was a communication of principles.

On tho&s;e que&s;tions depend the SECRET of your own Revolu|tion, and of tho&s;e which are PREPARING.</HI><NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot"><P>The practices of the French Republic to <HI>prepare</HI> a Revolution at Geneva are now no longer a <HI>&s;ecret;</HI> and before we accede to the opinion that &s;he may &s;afely be treated with, the following &s;eries of facts which they offer &s;hould be con&s;idered.</P>
<P N="1">1&s;t, The pre&s;ent Convention refu&s;ed to ratify a treaty with Geneva, made and &s;igned in her name by a General inve&s;ted with full powers for that purpo&s;e, and approved by the Mini&s;ters.</P>
<P N="2">2dly, She pretended to give a colour for this abu&s;e of power by decreeing the arre&s;t of her Plenipotentiary, Monte&s;quiou, though the Mini&s;ters declared that he had only acted according to their orders.</P>
<P N="3">3dly, To give additional effect to this unexampled abu&s;e of power, the Convention took care to wait till the treaty was not only ratified, but almo&s;t completely executed, on the part of Geneva; and till the retreat of the Swi&s;s troops which had advanced to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance left them de&s;titute of defence.</P>
<P N="4">4thly, The French Republic had no other object, in &s;ub&s;tituting negociation for force, but to deceive and di&s;arm the allies of Ge|neva; and to put it out of their power to prevent that derange|ment of the &s;ocial order e&s;tabli&s;hed there, which &s;he was deter|mined to effect at any ri&s;k.</P>
<P N="5">5thly, Her mea&s;ures were di&s;gui&s;ed by &s;olemn treaties, which there is proof &s;he intended to violate, at the very moment &s;he con|tracted them; and which were violated only to bring about a Revolution i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> Geneva, more mi&s;chievous in its con&s;equences than any that could have followed from war.</P>
<P N="6">6thly, If for &s;o incon&s;iderable an object as that of &s;ubverting the limited Democracy of Geneva, the Republic of France, while yet in her infancy, and previous to her victories, did not &s;cruple to di&s;|grace her&s;elf by an open violation of her fir&s;t treaty, made with the weake&s;t of her neighbours: then let that State which of all her neighbours is the mo&s;t formidable to her, and who&s;e con&s;titution &s;he has avowed it is e&s;&s;ential to her intere&s;ts to de&s;troy; and which neverthele&s;s is per&s;uaded to di&s;arm it&s;elf, and to rely on the faith of treaties&mdash;let that State fir&s;t have &s;ome &s;ecurity, that the French Republic, under the government of the &s;ame party, though not with the &s;ame chiefs, will treat with more honour, and execute its treaties with more fidelity.</P>
<P>I repeat it, there is but one &s;ecurity which can be given for this, or which ought to be accepted; I mean, the immediate re&s;titution of all her conque&s;ts.</P></NOTE></P>
<P>Since we know that &s;uch principles as the&s;e induced the Girondi&s;t party, which at that time was all-power|ful in France, to violate and annul the fir&s;t treaty &s;igned by the French Republic, <HI>it remains</HI> perhaps <HI>to be con&s;idered</HI> whether it would be wi&s;e to place implicit confidence in any new treaties which that party may now be di&s;po&s;ed to enter into, with any Government which does not (in their opinion) <HI>derive its authority immediately from the people.</HI> Con&s;idering however that circum&s;tances are now very much changed; and aware too that their conduct may differ according to
<PB N="17" REF="048483_0018_1025307381CF64E8">
the magnitude of the object; I will admit that in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of things we may confide in the &s;incerity of the French Republic; but I &s;till deny that we can rely on the &s;olidity of any peace, unle&s;s &s;he will gua|rantee it by a re&s;titution of all her conque&s;ts; and I mu&s;t add, that nothing le&s;s than &s;uch a re&s;titution will re&s;tore the balance of power in Europe.</P>
<P>Whatever our new Preceptors may pretend, this balance of power is the &s;alvation of Europe: it pre|&s;erves its tranquillity, preci&s;ely in the &s;ame way that the balances of the Briti&s;h Con&s;titution pre&s;erve the liberties of the people: it protects weak nations from the u&s;urpations of powerful ones, and provides a ge|neral &s;ecurity again&s;t the abu&s;e of &s;trength in a general coalition to repre&s;s it. This admirable equipoi&s;e of the forces of Europe has now been for two centuries the palladium of her civilization. Formed by it into one exten&s;ive and wealthy confederation, &s;he has been &s;aved from the deva&s;tations of &s;avage invaders.&mdash;It is only &s;ince the adoption of this &s;y&s;tem (accompanied and a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the Reformation) that barbari&s;m has vani&s;hed from Europe. Like Greece during a &s;imilar equipoi&s;e among her Republics, &s;he has &s;ince that
<PB N="18" REF="048483_0019_102530859D8C0E70">
period enjoyed in an eminent degree the ble&s;&s;ings of &s;ocial order, and protection from oppre&s;&s;ion; and has cultivated with unexampled &s;ucce&s;s, the arts of which peace is the parent, and the &s;ciences of which &s;he is the nur&s;e. Favoured by this &s;y&s;tem, the nations of Europe were hourly acquiring knowledge, freedom, and happine&s;s, when this new philo&s;ophy appeared, to tell them that they were ignorant and &s;uper&s;titious &s;laves. It is neverthele&s;s this equipoi&s;e of force that has given Europe &s;uch a decided &s;uperiority over the other two great divi&s;ions of the ancient world, which though in many re&s;pects more favoured by nature, yet will never emerge from their pre&s;ent abject condition, until &s;ome divi&s;ions of power are e&s;tabli&s;hed among them; &s;ome federal &s;y&s;tem, adapted to their circum|&s;tances, which can &s;ecure them from conque&s;t, and protect the independence of the weak from the vio|lence of the &s;trong.</P>
<P>Let us calculate, if po&s;&s;ible, all the advantages which Europe has derived from this &s;y&s;tem &s;ince the treaty of We&s;tphalia, and then e&s;timate the mi&s;eries which &s;he brought upon her&s;elf by neglecting it when Louis XIV. fir&s;t began his enterpri&s;es. Can any one who con&s;iders the &s;ubject, believe that the war which ravaged almo&s;t all Europe about a century ago, would ever have taken place, if in 1667 (the period of the fir&s;t attack by Louis XVI.) the parties to the treaty of We&s;tphalia had under&s;tood their true inte|re&s;ts well enough to &s;ee, that then was the moment to unite again&s;t the ambition of France? The exertions which might have effectually &s;topped Louis in the beginning of his career, and compelled him to retreat within his own territories, would have been nothing in compari&s;on of the &s;acrifices which they were after|vards obliged to make, merely to prevent him from pa&s;&s;ing the new boundary to which his fir&s;t enterpri&s;e enabled him to extend his dominions.</P>
<P>Who will deny that the French Republic is now what Louis XVI. was in 1667, with the &s;ame over-bearing
<PB N="19" REF="048483_0020_1025308CEDC168D0">
temper, the &s;ame thir&s;t of dominion, the &s;ame pa&s;&s;ion for aggrandi&s;ement? Who does not &s;hudder at the pro&s;pect of the torrents of blood which mu&s;t &s;low for an age to come, if, by ceding to this military Republic any portion of its immen&s;e conque&s;ts, we in|toxicate it with the ambitious de&s;ire of increa&s;ing them hereafter; or if we adopt the immoral policy of yielding at pre&s;ent, with the &s;ecret intention of re|newing the conte&s;t at a more favourable opportunity?</P>
<P>The re&s;titution of her conque&s;ts&mdash;of all of them without exception, mu&s;t be the only ba&s;is of a &s;olid peace; and now that the fury of the revolutionary &s;torm is &s;o much abated, the ultimate object of the war, an object which Europe and Great-Britain &s;hould never lo&s;e &s;ight of, is to pre&s;erve in full force the confederation of We&s;tphalia. I do not he&s;itate to &s;ay that if the greater part of the allied Powers &s;hould be pu&s;illanimous enough to wi&s;h to purcha&s;e leave to retain what they have remaining, by finally abandon|ing what they have lo&s;t; &s;till the &s;olemn engagements of Great-Britain, her dignity, and her intere&s;t, re|quire of her to exert all the authority which &s;he derives from her preponderance in the alliance, in prevailing on them not to betray their own cau&s;e; and, under any circum&s;tances, to employ her whole force in defending it.</P>
<P>But po&s;&s;ibly her Allies, fatigued with the conte&s;t, may &s;ay, "If the French Republic per&s;i&s;t in refu&s;ing to re&s;tore her conque&s;ts, mu&s;t we have no alternative; but be obliged to allow her an opportunity of adding to them, by prolonging a war which has already given her &s;o many provinces, and added &s;o much to her re&s;ources for pur&s;uing it with increa&s;ing &s;ucce&s;s?"</P>
<P>As to her re&s;ources, they no longer exi&s;t, or, at any rate, mu&s;t very &s;oon be totally exhau&s;ted. It is upon this circum&s;tance that Europe &s;hould fix its attention; for it inevitably leads to a complete re&s;titution of the provinces which have been lo&s;t. At pre&s;ent the en|thu&s;ia&s;m
<PB N="20" REF="048483_0021_10253098271128E0">
of her enemies is abated, and the war differs from former wars in the&s;e re&s;pects only: 1&s;t, That the German States complain of being exhau&s;ted before they have &s;uffered a third part of what the &s;even-years war co&s;t them; 2dly, That the French, by bring|ing into action the whole of their re&s;ources at once, and pu&s;hing on with their national impetuo&s;ity, have hitherto been irre&s;i&s;tible; and 3dly, That as to the relative &s;ituation of the conquerors and the conquered, the former are infinitely more exhau&s;ted than the latter.</P>
<P>If there be a political truth, which the hi&s;tory of modern Europe puts out of all controver&s;y, it is this: that every war is now more or le&s;s a war of finance, invariably terminating to the di&s;advantage of that Power who&s;e pecuniary re&s;ources are &s;oone&s;t exhau&s;ted. The great Frederic learned this axiom from his father, never lo&s;t &s;ight of it, and owed to it all his &s;ucce&s;s. If we read his works, we &s;hall find, that it was only by an admirable management of his revenues, and by his care to have always new re&s;ources in re&s;erve, that he was able to &s;up|port, for &s;even &s;ucce&s;&s;ive years, and at la&s;t to ter|minate with glory, a conte&s;t full of di&s;a&s;ters, and during which his enemies overran the whole of his dominions. When at la&s;t he obliged them to re|treat, and to re&s;tore all that they had taken from him, it was becau&s;e they felt an inability to per&s;i&s;t in the war, the nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence of exhau&s;ted re&s;ources; while, with a fore&s;ight which &s;ecured &s;ucce&s;s, the great abilities of Frederic had been directed as much to recruit his trea&s;ures as his armies.</P>
<P>It is true, that when the means of war altogether depended on the accumulation of trea&s;ure, its duration might be more ea&s;ily be calculated beforehand than now, that nations have di&s;covered the dangerous &s;ecret of charging its expences on unborn gene|rations,
<PB N="21" REF="048483_0022_102530A756BCA5F0">
by additional debts. But &s;till, if, in com|paring the &s;trength of contending Powers, we add to their exi&s;ting re&s;ources, tho&s;e which are derived from credit, we may foretell with &s;ufficient certainty which of them will ultimately be the mo&s;t powerful, and con&s;equently which has the be&s;t rea&s;on to expect &s;ucce&s;s from per&s;everance. In the pre&s;ent war, there|fore, before a thought is admitted on the part of the Allies of buying a peace by &s;acrifices, which mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily render it in&s;ecure; before we give way to de&s;pondency, we &s;hould examine whether our antagoni&s;t is not much nearer the end of his trea&s;ures and his credit than we are; whether the di&s;tre&s;s re&s;ulting from this circum&s;tance does not more than counterbalance any victory in the field; and whe|ther, in &s;pite of his wide-extended acqui&s;itions, he is not on the point of being in a &s;ituation to &s;ay with Pyrrhus, <HI>One victory more, and I am undone.</HI></P>
<P>An object then at pre&s;ent of the greate&s;t import|ance, is to compare the military re&s;ources, or, which in truth is the &s;ame thing, the finances and the credit of France with tho&s;e of Great Britain; for it is from &s;uch a compari&s;on only that we can decide whether the latter ought to make any conce&s;&s;ion for the &s;ake of peace.</P>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>That at pre&s;ent the only Re&s;ource of France is her A&s;&s;ignats, on which even her future military exertions mu&s;t exclu&s;ively depend; which are depreciating with a continually accelerating pro|gre&s;&s;ion, and in a &s;hort time mu&s;t inevitably be of no value whatever.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>THE Author of the <HI>Reflections on Peace</HI> begins with the following bold a&s;&s;ertion: <Q>The whole power of the French Revolution con&s;i&s;ts in the art of exciting popular enthu&s;ia&s;m, and directing it to political pur|po&s;es.</Q> Page 1, line 1.</P>
<P>This (though a&s;&s;umed, and afterwards relied on as a fundamental propo&s;ition) I mu&s;t deny without any he&s;itation. In the commencement of the Revo|lution it might be true, but has long &s;ince cea&s;ed to be &s;o: for, admitting that popular enthu&s;ia&s;m, with liberty for its object, was the in&s;trument employed to overturn the French Monarchy, and to repel the attempts of the Combined Powers to re&s;tore it; yet the republican &s;y&s;tem which &s;ucceeded it, could neither have been founded nor &s;upported &s;o long, but by a cau&s;e more &s;imple, more durable, and more unremittingly active:&mdash;I mean &s;elf-intere&s;t, which has been &s;timulated by the invention of a&s;&s;ignats. In them, and in them only, con&s;i&s;ts at pre&s;ent <HI>all the power of the French Revolution.</HI> It is by them that it has &s;ucceeded in bribing every per&s;onal con|&s;ideration. By &s;tipends to civil officers, who are

every one preachers of the new-fa&s;hioned doctrines, it has &s;ucceeded in &s;preading them to every corner of France. Even its foreign conque&s;ts are merely to be attributed to the a&s;&s;ignats, which have hitherto pro|vided for 1,200,000 &s;oldiers; and no doubt &s;o extraordinary a number mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have pro|duced extraordinary effects. If the conque&s;ts of the French Republic have been three times as exten&s;ive as tho&s;e of Louis XIV. it is becau&s;e the a&s;&s;ignats have enabled it to maintain armies three times as numerous.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><HI>Of the truth of this we have the following confirmations in the Convention, by Cambon, Feb. 8, 1795.</HI></P>
<P>The nation is under great obligations to the Con&s;tituent A&s;&s;embly for the creation of a&s;&s;ignats. This territorial money has very much a&s;&s;i&s;ted the Revolution, by bringing into circulation the value of the national domains, by enabling us to provi&s;ion, equip, and maintain armies to the amount of <HI>1200,000</HI> men, to create fleets, to cultivate the lands for &s;altpetre! to manufacture arms, &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>

<P>So long as the a&s;&s;ignats were i&s;&s;ued in any &s;ort of proportion to the confi&s;cations which were pledged for them, they had a real value, and the project was greatly &s;ucce&s;sful. But from the time that the Con|vention, intoxicated by a di&s;covery &s;o unexpected,
<PB N="24" REF="048483_0025_102530D0AFAA7BF0">
and by means &s;o immen&s;e, began to employ it&s;elf in contriving pretences for new wars, in order to bring them into action; when it began to work this rich mine, as if ab&s;olutely inexhau&s;tible; every intel|ligent ob&s;erver fore&s;aw the rapid and complete de|preciation of its produce. The calculation that no|thing could prolong the exi&s;tence of a&s;&s;ignats beyond two or three years, has indeed proved erroneous; but it has proved &s;o, merely becau&s;e it was impo&s;&s;i|ble to conjecture that &s;uch extraordinary means would be adopted for &s;upporting them; and that Robe&s;|pierre would come forward to prop them up, when tottering, by his two additional projects of &s;poliation and terror.</P>
<P>His proce&s;s is well known. He began by a de|cree, which &s;eized all the &s;pecie that could be found, of every &s;ort, and paid for it with a&s;&s;ignats. He then impo&s;ed the <HI>Law of the Maximum,</HI> and that of <HI>Requi&s;itions;</HI> mea&s;ures which, &s;o long as they could be borne, gave this new money a forced circulation, and a pretended value. But as decrees &s;o oppre&s;&s;ive could not be enforced without having innumerable officers and informers,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The following extract from a &s;peech of Cambon's, on the 4th of November, will give &s;ome idea of the expence incurred by Robe&s;pierre's &s;y&s;tem of terror.</P>
<P><HI>A Government was formed which co&s;t</HI> 591 <HI>millions</HI> (almo&s;t 25 millions &s;terling) <HI>annually, merely in in&s;pection. Immediately the hu&s;bandmen and manufacturers left their u&s;ual occupations, which made them u&s;eful citizens, to become members of Revolutionary Committees, where they had nothing to do, and by which they enjoyed a &s;ort of au|thority, and received five livres a day.</HI></P></NOTE> to compel the people to &s;ub|mit to them, he met the difficulties re&s;ulting from this multiplication of expence, by contriving a new &s;ecurity for new emi&s;&s;ions of a&s;&s;ignats.</P>
<P>For this purpo&s;e the &s;y&s;tem of terror was adopted in its fulle&s;t extent, merely as a mea&s;ure of finance, in which view Robe&s;pierre undoubtedly con&s;idered it; and &s;uch was the &s;ucce&s;s of his horrible pro&s;criptions,
<PB N="25" REF="048483_0026_102530DDCFE69268">
that in &s;ome in&s;tances the very &s;ame e&s;tates have actually been three times confi&s;cated and &s;old again. The a&s;&s;ignats i&s;&s;ued were but a &s;ort of bills of exchange, drawn on the Revolutionary Tribunal, and paid by the Guillotine, which Robe&s;pierre is &s;aid to have called <HI>an engine for coining money.</HI></P>
<P>In this way, as &s;oon as the inferior and &s;ubaltern robbers of their country were grown rich enough to be worth plundering, the Guillotine transferred their wealth to the State, and furni&s;hed the &s;ecurity wanted for new emi&s;&s;ions of a&s;&s;ignats: this &s;anguinary con|trivance had the de&s;ired effect on the infatuated mul|titude, who imagined that their value would not alter, at lea&s;t in the interior of the Republic, as long as they could find any demagogues to load with riches one day, and to plunder on the next. It was by this terrible round of confi&s;cations, dilapidations of pub|lic wealth, executions, and emi&s;&s;ions of new paper, that the credit of the a&s;&s;ignats was &s;upported for more than a year, and the Republic was actually enabled to provi&s;ion her fourteen armies at a cheaper rate, though with paper money, than the Allies could their forces with &s;pecie. To produce this political miracle, co&s;t Robe&s;pierre nothing more than a decla|ration that half the property of France was to change its owners by violent means.</P>
<P>However, tho&s;e who were thus enriched, not finding them&s;elves at all more &s;ecure than tho&s;e who were &s;uffered to retain their property, began of cour&s;e to unite with them for the de&s;truction of a tyrant equally dangerous to both: almo&s;t a year elap&s;ed before the object could be gained; but at la&s;t he, in his turn, was dragged to execution; and by his death began a new epoch in the hi&s;tory of a&s;&s;ignats.</P>
<P>Every preceding faction, however atrocious its mea&s;ures, had been regularly &s;upplanted by another propo&s;ing mea&s;ures &s;till more atrocious; but as it was impo&s;&s;ible to go beyond Robe&s;pierre in
<PB N="26" REF="048483_0027_1024A539B2A46E88">
cruelty, tho&s;e who &s;upplanted him had no way to &s;ecure them&s;elves, but by promi&s;ing to be more moderate; and particularly they found them&s;elves obliged to begin with aboli&s;hing the law of the <HI>Maximum,</HI> and leaving the Guillotine which had &s;upported it, without employment.</P>
<P>But though they could not but know that the &s;up|pre&s;&s;ion of the <HI>maximum</HI> mu&s;t be fatal to the a&s;&s;ignats, yet they never once dreamt of propo&s;ing a general peace; though it was the only mea&s;ure which was likely to prevent further depreciation, by making further emi&s;&s;ions unnece&s;&s;ary. They ob&s;tinately per|&s;i&s;ted in carrying on the war, though they were no longer able to fix the currency, or to keep up the value of the a&s;&s;ignats, which they were obliged to i&s;&s;ue for its expence.</P>
<P>From that time their relative value has fallen, and mu&s;t continue to fall in the compound ratio of the depreciation of the exi&s;ting ma&s;s (already much greater than can be brought into circulation), and of its continual augmentation. Nor is this all&mdash;for their depreciation is advancing with a rapidity continually and inevitably accelerated by this very &s;imple cir|cum&s;tance, that the lower tho&s;e which have been al|ready i&s;&s;ued fall in one month, to the greater nominal amount mu&s;t new ones be i&s;&s;ued in the next, in order to defray equal expences; and the Convention can only bear up again&s;t the effect of their pre&s;ent progre&s;&s;ive diminution of value, by means which ha&s;ten their ruin. By increa&s;ing the quantity which they i&s;&s;ue in one month, they condemn them&s;elves to i&s;&s;ue a &s;till greater quantity in the next. I appeal, for the truth of this, to the la&s;t monthly report of their expenditure which we are acquainted with, that of <HI>Nivo&s;e,</HI> which, though by no means a time of gene|ral military operations, co&s;t near eighteeen millions of pounds &s;terling, almo&s;t twice as much as the month

The principle on which they did it is ju&s;t; and indeed, as Cambon ob&s;erved at the time, the &s;ame principle might have allowed them to increa&s;e the &s;um almo&s;t fourfold; becau&s;e, even then, the a&s;&s;ignats were at a di&s;count of no le&s;s than 73 per cent. No wonder then that, ten days after, the Con|vention found it&s;elf obliged to decree the &s;ame aug|mentation of pay to tho&s;e in all other civil employ|ments; it is rather &s;urpri&s;ing, that it has hitherto refrained from doubling in the &s;ame way the pay of its fourteen armies; and it would be &s;till more &s;ur|pri&s;ing, if it could avoid a progre&s;&s;ive increa&s;e of all the &s;alaries, according to the progre&s;&s;ive depreciation of its paper money.</P>
<P>The law of the <HI>maximum,</HI> and its train of terrors, gave an artificial credit to the a&s;&s;ignats; and of con&s;e|quence, when the Convention was reduced to the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of taking away this only &s;upport of them, their fall was proportionably rapid. The people no &s;ooner began to perceive this, than an unbounded &s;pirit of jobbing &s;hewed it&s;elf with re&s;pect to every &s;ort of com|modity, to every thing which could po&s;&s;ibly be ex|changed for paper; and this &s;pirit has extended to every part of France, and to the lowe&s;t cla&s;&s;es of &s;o|ciety.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Boi&s;&s;y d'Anglas repre&s;ents this very forcibly to the Conven|tion, in a &s;peech of the 3d of March.</HI> At a time when objects of commerce fail, and when requi&s;itions, pre-emptions, arbitrary regula|tions of prices, and the ab&s;urd law of the maximum, have di&s;couraged cultivation, the citizens are irre&s;i&s;tibly led to &s;peculations which occa|&s;ion an unbounded de&s;ire of gain, and in&s;tead of commerce are mere gaming.</NOTE> Goods of all &s;orts changing their owners al|mo&s;t every day and every hour, are each time &s;old for more and more a&s;&s;ignats.

<P>It is true, that in the neutral towns, and on the fron|tiers of France, the di&s;credit of the a&s;&s;ignats has by no means been &s;o rapid as in the interior; but the rea&s;on is obvious. In tho&s;e places they had before a regular exchange for &s;pecie, the cour&s;e of which de|pended upon commercial opinion, uncontrouled by the <HI>maximum,</HI> or the <HI>guillotine;</HI> and in&s;tead of a forced value, they were previou&s;ly &s;ubject to a di&s;|count which varied according to circum&s;tances. But as the exchange of a&s;&s;ignats on the frontiers is the only rule to e&s;timate their former value, or to gue&s;s at their future di&s;credit, it is enough to ob&s;erve, that between the 24th of January, and the 24th of March, 1795, they fell one half in Swi&s;&s;erland; having been at a di&s;count, which, during that period, progre&s;&s;ively increa&s;ed from 80 to 90 per cent.; &s;o that, in the &s;hort &s;pace of two months, they fell from a fifth to a tenth only of their original value.</P>
<P>The con&s;equence of this rapidly progre&s;&s;ive depre|ciation mu&s;t be obvious to every one; &s;ince there cannot be a doubt but, if they continue to fall at the rate of 50 per cent. every two months, in a very &s;hort time the a&s;&s;ignats now in circulation will not be worth the trouble and expence of i&s;&s;uing them. But &s;uppo&s;e this event can be delayed to the end of the pre&s;ent year, or even beyond it, in the pre&s;ent &s;tate of things it mu&s;t inevitably h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters">en; and when it does happen, I a&s;k what po&s;&s;ible re&s;ource the Republic will have for the pre&s;ervation of its conque&s;ts, and the provi|&s;ion nece&s;&s;ary for the numerous armies which maintain tho&s;e conque&s;ts; and which no longer con&s;i&s;t of vo|lunteers and enthu&s;ia&s;ts, but of forced levies, and

mere di&s;ciplined mercenaries. Its only &s;tep mu&s;t be to di&s;band its armies before they mutiny for want of pay, to re&s;tore its conque&s;ts before the troops de&s;ert them, and offer a peace before they are compelled to &s;ue for it from ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity: &s;o that a re&s;titution of all the conque&s;ts made by the Republic, and a &s;olid and la&s;ting peace, mu&s;t &s;peedily be the con&s;equence of the rapid and inevitable fall of the a&s;&s;ignats, if the Allies will but have patience and &s;teadine&s;s enough to wait the event without relaxing their military exertions.</P>
<P>I &s;ay, <HI>if the Allies have but &s;teadine&s;s enough to wait the event without relaxing their military exertions;</HI> be|cau&s;e it is evident that the progre&s;&s;ive fall of the a&s;|&s;ignats ari&s;es principally from the nece&s;&s;ity of i&s;&s;uing new ones. But &s;ince this nece&s;&s;ity mu&s;t continue as long as the war la&s;ts, and mu&s;t be urgent in pro|portion to the exertions which the French are obliged to counteract, it &s;eems evident, that the annihilation of this, their only remaining re&s;ource for carrying on the war, or pre&s;erving their conque&s;ts, will be the &s;ooner effected, in proportion as the co-operation of the Allied Powers is more active and per&s;evering; and that every one of tho&s;e Powers which withdraws it&s;elf from the confederation, po&s;tpones this total bank|ruptcy, in proportion as the Republic, by being able to le&s;&s;en its expences, is in a le&s;&s;er degree obliged to accelerate its own ruin by i&s;&s;uing new a&s;&s;ignats. The defection, however, of &s;ome of the Allies can do no more than po&s;tpone this event, which it is impo&s;&s;ible to avoid, but by a general peace, the only mea&s;ure which can put an end to the nece&s;&s;ity of new emi&s;|&s;ions; and till that nece&s;&s;ity is at an end, no attempt to &s;upport the credit of the exi&s;ting a&s;&s;ignats can an|&s;wer any purpo&s;e.</P>

<P>I may be told that the calamities of war may po&s;|&s;ibly revive the &s;y&s;tem of terror; but this I po&s;i|tively deny. This infernal prodigy in the French Revolution never can be repeated; even the Nero of France, with his legion of executioners, did not make it la&s;t longer than fourteen months; and I am not afraid to a&s;&s;ert that it would have been a thou&s;and times more ea&s;y for him to have prolonged its exi&s;t|ence another year, than for his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, who owed their elevation to the abolition of it, to revive it for a &s;ingle day.</P>
<P>I may al&s;o be told that Robe&s;pierre has left them an immen&s;e fund in the e&s;tates which, though al|ready confi&s;cated, have not hitherto been &s;old, and which are a &s;ufficient &s;ecurity for new emi&s;&s;ions of a&s;&s;ignats.

<P>But we want no better proof of the fal&s;ehood of &s;uch an a&s;&s;ertion than this, that, preci&s;ely at the time when it was made, the a&s;&s;ignats began to fall more rapidly than ever.

<P>I have already &s;aid that Robe&s;pierre not having been able to &s;upport him&s;elf but by the utmo&s;t ex|ce&s;&s;es of the mo&s;t flagrant inju&s;tice, his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors had in fact no way of &s;ecuring them&s;elves but by ab&s;o|lutely oppo&s;ite mea&s;ures: of any &s;uch mea&s;ures the &s;afe&s;t for them was an union with the Federali&s;ts, who&s;e faction, though it had been cru&s;hed and di&s;per&s;ed by Robe&s;pierre, was &s;till both numerous and powerful. As a mea&s;ure of party, nothing could be more pru|dent than this union; but it mu&s;t be allowed too that nothing could be more de&s;tructive to the a&s;&s;ignats: for it was clearly impo&s;&s;ible for the then prevailing members of the Convention to procure the &s;upport of the Federali&s;ts, without re&s;toring the va&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions they had been deprived of.</P>

<P>Surely the time when they were <HI>looking forward</HI> to the&s;e confi&s;cations, was the time when Le Cointre &s;hould have awakened <HI>the reflections</HI> of his colleague Robe&s;pierre.

<P>It is to no purpo&s;e that the greater part of tho&s;e who have &s;ucceeded Robe&s;pierre, per&s;i&s;t in attempting to deceive their countrymen, and Europe;&mdash;to no purpo&s;e that they &s;till talk of ten or twelve milliards (4 or 500 millions &s;terling) which they pretend the property of the emigrants will produce, and which, they would per&s;uade the world, is a &s;ecurity enough to redeem all the a&s;&s;ignats in exi&s;tence, and all that they may have occa&s;ion to i&s;&s;ue. They them&s;elves well know that nothing can be more untrue; for by their own calculations it may be proved, that all the confi&s;cations which remain un&s;old are really not worth a fourth part of &s;uch a &s;um.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Johannot, who &s;eems to have more integrity than any other per&s;on who has had the management of the Revolutionary finances, in his report on that &s;ubject, of the 22d of December, &s;ays, <HI>What|ever their amount may be, yet the &s;ecurity for them is much greater. Accurate calculations prove that this &s;ecurity is more than</HI> 15 <HI>mil|liards</HI> (i. e. more than 625000,000 &s;terling). <HI>The yearly income of the national property which remains un&s;old, is about</HI> 300,000,000 (12,500,000 &s;terling), <HI>which, e&s;timated at forty years purcha&s;e, the current price of that property, gives a real value of</HI> 12 <HI>milliards</HI> (500,000,000); <HI>which, with the e&s;tates not let, and the unproductive property, (both together at lea&s;t worth two milliards) and one milliard which will revert to the nation by e&s;tates that would have de&s;cended to emigrants, form an actual value of</HI> 15 <HI>milliards</HI> (625,000,000). <HI>Never had any paper-money &s;o &s;olid a ba&s;e!</HI></P>
<P>When I undertake to mea&s;ure <HI>this ba&s;e,</HI> I pre&s;ume I &s;hall be al|lowed to lay out of the account the two milliards <HI>at which e&s;tates not let, and unproductive property, are valued;</HI> and to rea&s;on merely upon Johannot's a&s;&s;ertion, that la&s;t December the amount of the annual income of the confi&s;cated e&s;tates which were not &s;old, was <HI>about</HI> 300,000,000 (12,500,000). Now admitting this e&s;timate as true, we have a tolerably accurate rule to value the capital of tho&s;e 300,000,000 of income by, not in a&s;&s;ignats, which &s;oon will have no exi&s;tence, but in &s;pecie.</P>
<P>Every one knows that formerly, in France, landed property &s;old from about 28 to 30 years purcha&s;e; and it will not be di&s;puted, but that while &s;o great a ma&s;s of it is in the market, it mu&s;t be difficult to find buyers who will go beyond 25 years purcha&s;e in &s;pecie. But in fact, it will be impo&s;&s;ible to find them at that price: 1&s;t, becau&s;e the rent it&s;elf is e&s;timated by a&s;&s;ignats; 2dly, becau&s;e a great part of this property is in hou&s;es, which are every day fall|ing to decay; 3dly, becau&s;e we know, from the ingenuous confe&s;&s;ion of Cambon, on the 28th of February, <HI>that e&s;tates are ruined if they remain in the hands of the Republic; and if &s;old, intriguers take care to be the be&s;t bidders, and, as &s;oon as they get po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, &s;ell the timber, &s;trip the e&s;tate, and when the &s;econd payment &s;hould be made, the Na|tion is obliged to &s;ell them again at the exorbitant lo&s;s occa&s;ioned by the&s;e dilapidations.</HI></P>
<P>We &s;ee then by the&s;e recent acknowledgements, that it is the&s;e <HI>intriguing</HI> purcha&s;ers which have enabled the Convention to boa&s;t of the enormous prices given for national property; and of which circum&s;tance it has from time to time made &s;uch a parade; taking care however not to mention their being left on hand, and re&s;old at <HI>an exorbitant lo&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>I believe, when the&s;e circum&s;tances are con&s;idered, no one will di&s;pute with me, but that, if even the Republic &s;hould be &s;ettled, and all the confi&s;cated e&s;tates &s;hould remain at her di&s;po&s;al, it will hardly be able to get more for them than even twenty years pur|cha&s;e in &s;pecie, if calculated upon the rent paid in a&s;&s;ignats; a price which, in &s;pecie, it is now very improbable they can ever bring. But &s;uppo&s;ing it &s;hould be able to &s;ell them at this price, the whole of them would not fetch more than 6 milliards (250 millions &s;terling). Now, from the&s;e 6 milliards in &s;pecie, for which at pre&s;ent we hypothetically admit that the e&s;tates let for 300,000,000 currency may be &s;old, we mu&s;t in the fir&s;t place deduct the immen&s;e re&s;titu|tions made to the Federali&s;ts and others, conformably to the decree pa&s;&s;ed on the 20th of la&s;t March: and though, to le&s;&s;en the oppo|&s;ition to this decree, tho&s;e who propo&s;ed it, affected to a&s;&s;ert that the&s;e re&s;titutions would not amount to more than one milliard (41,666,666), I apprehend that the confi&s;cations during the tyranny of Robe&s;piere, may, without the lea&s;t exaggeration, be computed at a third of the property which la&s;t December remained un&s;old; particularly when we are informed by the late&s;t news-pa|pers from Paris, that, in the month of April, the Committe of Finance propo&s;ed <HI>an ab&s;olute re&s;titution of the property of all but the Emigrants;</HI> &s;o that, after this deduction, only two-thirds of the whole &s;um, or 4 milliards, remain.</P>
<P>Out of the&s;e 4 milliards, mu&s;t be paid the immen&s;e debts of the Emigrants, debts which <HI>the State is charged with,</HI> by a decree of the Convention, made January 1, 1795. And as Cambon decla|red at that time, that the Emigrants had not fewer than about <HI>a million of creditors;</HI> and as the Committee of Finances has &s;ince e&s;timated tho&s;e debts at 1 milliard 800,000,000 of livres; this will reduce what remains to the State to &s;omething more than two mil|liards.</P>
<P>With the&s;e two milliards, it has to pay all the a&s;&s;ignats now in circulation; and which, if Cambon may be believed, amounted to 6 milliards 400 millions, &s;o long ago as the 4th of la&s;t Novem|ber; and which, notwith&s;tanding &s;ome of them have &s;ince been taken out of circulation, yet, by the additions that have &s;ince been made, cannot now amount to le&s;s than 8 or 9 milliards. It has al&s;o to pay all the new a&s;&s;ignats which mu&s;t be i&s;&s;ued as long as the war la&s;ts: and who can calculate the amount to which, in con&s;equence of depreciation, they mu&s;t be i&s;&s;ued by next December, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word"> the French &s;hould delay the re&s;titution of their conque&s;ts till that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">me?</P>
<P>Be&s;ides all this, before the ma&s;s of a&s;&s;ignats can be redeemed, provi&s;ion ought to be made for the annuities purcha&s;ed during the monarchy, which amount to about 100,000,000 a year (more than <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> millions &s;terling). Suppo&s;ing this debt to be paid with a da&s;h of the pen, yet it will not be quite &s;o ea&s;y to &s;trike out the great promi&s;es which have been made to a million of &s;oldiers, for whom the Committee of Finance propo&s;es to re&s;erve a milliard, as the reward of their &s;ervices. Nor is this all; for a con&s;ideration more pre&s;&s;ing than any even of the&s;e is, to repair what Echa&s;&s;eriaux <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">lls the <HI>ruins of agriculture,</HI> and which will require immen&s;e and immediate advances.</P>
<P>Add to all this the nece&s;&s;ary expences to carry on the govern|ment, even if the war were over, till the revenue can again be made productive, which at pre&s;ent, reduced as it is in nominal amount, is &s;till more reduced by being paid in depreciated a&s;&s;ignats, and I am confident is not equal to &pound;.700,000 &s;terling in &s;pecie: and which, in the impoveri&s;hed and depopulated &s;tate of France, cannot be brought near to the nece&s;&s;ary expences, however econo|mically it may be managed, without being infinitely more bur|den&s;ome than four times that &s;um would have been before the Re|volution.</P>

<PB N="39" REF="048483_0040_1025328F2C0B9E98">
continued depreciation of a&s;&s;ignats, becomes, in its turn, a cau&s;e accelerating their ruin, which mu&s;t ap|proach with increa&s;ing rapidity, that nothing can check but a general peace. I would willingly believe that the pre&s;ent leaders of the Revolution have more integrity than their predece&s;&s;ors; but, as I cannot believe that they have greater ability, I am convinced they cannot di&s;cover any other way of carrying on the war than by new emi&s;&s;ions of depreciated a&s;&s;ignats. I defy them to give any &s;ort of permanent value to that immen&s;e ma&s;s which has been i&s;&s;ued, but by a general peace; or to put off much longer the day when their people, wearied with mi&s;ery, will compel them to abandon all projects of aggrandi&s;ement, and to &s;acrifice all their conque&s;ts, for &s;o nece&s;&s;ary an object; e&s;pecially if Great-Britain will but honourably per&s;i&s;t in rejecting any overture which does not propo&s;e a complete re&s;titution of all the French conque&s;ts, as a prelimi|nary article.</P>
<P>Some per&s;ons however, either intere&s;ted in mi&s;re|pre&s;enting the que&s;tion, or po&s;&s;ibly deceived by the quackery of the French Committee of Finance, &s;eem to imagine that &s;ome or other of the vi&s;ionary &s;chemes which that Committee either entertains, or wi&s;hes its con&s;tituents to entertain, may be practicable&mdash;&s;chemes <HI>which are to bring back the a&s;&s;ignats into the public trea|&s;ury by means purely voluntary.</HI></P>
<P>Fir&s;t then, as to the idea of Johannot, in a report of the 12th of la&s;t December, <HI>that the value of the mortgaged property increa&s;es in exact proportion to the multiplication of a&s;&s;ignats, and that it is to this con&s;tant inverted ratio between the value of the republican money, and that of the national property, that the French are indebted for tho&s;e inexhau&s;tible re&s;ources, which have a&s;toni&s;hed Europe, and have prepared the means of triumph for fourteen armies.</HI> But I mu&s;t deny that there has been &s;uch a <HI>con&s;tant inverted ratio</HI> between the fall of the a&s;&s;ignats, and the ri&s;e in the price of national property. If this progre&s;&s;ion had exi&s;ted at the time when Jo|hannot
<PB REF="048483_0041_102532A600869908">
made this report, a&s;&s;ignats being then at a di&s;|count of about 75 per cent. or only a fourth of their fir&s;t value, e&s;tates paid for in a&s;&s;ignats would con&s;e|quently have &s;old at four times the u&s;ual price: one, for in&s;tance, which at thirty years purcha&s;e, (the u&s;ual value before the war) would have &s;old for 1500<ABBR>l.</ABBR> in &s;pecie, would la&s;t December have &s;old for 6000<ABBR>l.</ABBR> in a&s;&s;ignats. But in the &s;ame &s;peech, he &s;ays, that the national domains &s;ell at only forty years purcha&s;e; &s;o that, by his own acknowledgement, the value of e&s;tates had only ri&s;en a fourth, while that of a&s;&s;ignats had fallen three fourths.</P>
<P>Po&s;&s;ibly &s;ome per&s;ons may attribute this a&s;toni&s;hing fall of the a&s;&s;ignats, not to their want of a real value, but &s;olely <HI>to the quantity of this repre&s;entative of wealth, multiplied in &s;uch a degree, as to de&s;troy all proportion between it and the objects which it repre&s;ents;</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Speech of Echa&s;&s;eriaux, December 20.</NOTE> &s;o that, by dimini&s;hing their ma&s;s, and relieving the circulation from half of the exi&s;ting a&s;&s;ignats, the remaining half would recover their original value.</P>
<P>It is now five months &s;ince this object engaged the attention of the Committee of Finance, and that they declared &s;uch a diminution indi&s;pen&s;able: but after having pre&s;ented report upon report, and project upon project, all that they have really done, has been to increa&s;e the enormous ma&s;s of a&s;&s;ignats, by forcing almo&s;t as many new ones into circulation as they pur|po&s;ed to withdraw from it.

Cambon ob&s;erved, that the lo&s;&s;es by the law of the <HI>maximum</HI> had been too great to allow of entertaining &s;uch a project; and as to <HI>revolutionary taxes,</HI> he avowed ingenuou&s;ly on the 3d of February, that the forced loan of about a milliard (about 41 millions &s;terling) had only produced between 180 and 200 millions (about 8 millions &s;terling). A &s;trange de|falcation, e&s;pecially when we recollect that it was while the &s;y&s;tem of terror was in its full force!</P>
<P>A &s;econd project was a lottery of four milliards (about 165 millions &s;terling), which was to induce the holders of a&s;&s;ignats to bring them into the public trea&s;ury, on receiving in&s;tead of them, in the &s;hape of prizes, effects which the Republic found it&s;elf unable to &s;ell in any other way. But then, &s;aid Cambon, <HI>we mu&s;t offer &s;ome premium</HI>&mdash;and he calculated that by allowing 10 per cent. it would co&s;t the nation 390 millions, and an annual intere&s;t of 131 millions.&mdash; A curious way of relieving the finances! Be&s;ides, whether as a lottery or as a tontine, the project is impo&s;|&s;ible; for either the purcha&s;e of tickets mu&s;t be vo|luntary, in which ca&s;e a &s;ecurity would be expected for their value, that does not exi&s;t; or el&s;e this re&s;ump|tion of a&s;&s;ignats mu&s;t be effected by force, and, far from improving the credit of any new emi&s;&s;ions, would only be evidence of their fate.</P>

Whatever re&s;ource might be found in &s;uch mea&s;ures, after a general peace; yet, while the war continues, they would be u&s;ele&s;s: for nothing but a general peace can take away the nece&s;&s;ity of new emi&s;&s;ions: and be&s;ides, to propo&s;e &s;uch a mea&s;ure to the French, in order to continue the war, would be mode&s;tly a&s;king them to burn half their fortunes, only to give the Convention an opportunity of annihilating the remainder&mdash;exhau&s;ting the little life that is left, in gra&s;ping for a few months more Savoy and Belgium, and putting off for a &s;hort time longer the return of the Stadtholder.</P>

<P>I do not deny that this concluding &s;cene of the French Revolution may be more or le&s;s delayed by different mea&s;ures, and particularly by a peace; but the propo&s;ition which I have undertaken to examine, does not relate to the termination of the Revolution, but to that of the War: whether, if it be protracted, any thing can po&s;&s;ibly delay much longer the annihi|lation of the paper-money, which, on the part of the French, is its only &s;upport; and whether Great-Britain &s;hould lo&s;e &s;ight of this circum&s;tance.</P>
<P>The ca&s;e of America, however, is &s;eemingly an example which directly contradicts all the&s;e conclu|&s;ions by the &s;ure te&s;t of experience; and may po&s;&s;ibly influence many opinions in this country.</P>

A &s;imilar illu&s;ion led us to per&s;i&s;t in the American war. At a great expence we per&s;evered, till at la&s;t the paper-money there was much more depreciated than that of France has yet been, or perhaps ever will be; and yet, at that very time, the

Congre&s;s was able to augment its forces, in&s;tead of dimini&s;hing them. To what purpo&s;e did we oppo&s;e our real to their artificial trea&s;ure? The 140 millions which we &s;pent, enabled us only to &s;pin out the war, which the Americans carried on again&s;t us with increa&s;ing &s;ucce&s;s. They &s;ur|mounted all ob&s;tacles, made an advantageous peace; and now, that hardly twelve years have elap&s;ed, their public credit is re&s;tored, their re|venues greatly exceed their expences, and their future pro&s;perity &s;eems incalculable.</Q></P>
<P>This repre&s;entation is true, &s;o far as it applies to America, and &s;o far only; for between that country and France there is no &s;ort of analogy. What re|&s;emblance is there between America, engaged in a conte&s;t at home, by no means expen&s;ive, and in which all Europe was on her &s;ide; and France ob|&s;tinately per&s;i&s;ting in a foreign war, in which her finances are oppo&s;ed by almo&s;t all the wealth of Eu|rope? What re&s;emblance between a Congre&s;s, re|pre&s;enting property by the principal proprietors, &s;upported gratuitou&s;ly by the armies and fleets of France, Spain, and Holland, who made her cau&s;e their own&mdash;and the French Convention, a mob, ap|pointed by a mob; which, &s;o far from having a &s;ingle ally, has been obliged to &s;pend very large &s;ums in purcha&s;ing the inactivity of &s;everal of the governments which &s;he had not provoked to take part again&s;t her? The Congre&s;s, when the depreciation of their paper currency made it requi&s;ite to negociate foreign loans, had France and Holland ready to guarantee them, and immen&s;e tracts of unappropriated land to offer as a &s;ecurity; a property which, with &s;ome moderate taxes, has proved an ample fund for di&s;charging their debt, and of cour&s;e has rai&s;ed it to its original value. But where are the per&s;ons who will now advance any money to the French Convention? Where are the Governments which will guarantee the repayment? and
<PB N="47" REF="048483_0048_1025332146CE2060">
what is the &s;ecurity which it can offer? In her &s;trug|gle for independence, America was not at one twelfth part of the expence of her antagoni&s;t; while France, on the contrary, &s;pends at pre&s;ent eight or ten times as much as the whole Coalition again&s;t her. In America the expences both of her friends and her enemies in|crea&s;ed very much her circulating &s;pecie; but in France gold and &s;ilver have almo&s;t vani&s;hed. Paper-money was indeed depreciated in America; but it was the provincial money which fell almo&s;t to nothing, and never recovered it&s;elf; while that i&s;&s;ued by the Congre&s;s never lo&s;t three-fourths of its original value, and was re&s;tored to it by means of which France is wholly de&s;titute.</P>
<P>But indeed what po&s;&s;ible re&s;emblance can be di&s;|covered between America, with re&s;ources con&s;tantly improving, even during the conte&s;t, by a reproduction of the nece&s;&s;aries of life, far greater than the con&s;ump|tion of her own people; re&s;ources directed all along by the &s;ame leaders, men previou&s;ly practi&s;ed in the arts of government, to one uniform object, and in a war at home&mdash;and France, with wants continually in|crea&s;ing, with reproduction greatly reduced, continu|ally changing its leaders, and its arrangements; and fighting at a di&s;tance, m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">rely for aggrandi&s;ement by conque&s;ts, much more expen&s;ive to pre&s;erve, than difficult to make?&mdash;What re&s;emblance between the French, who have hardly advanced a &s;tep without &s;ome novelty in wickedne&s;s, and who&s;e &s;ucce&s;&s;es, by a natu|ral con&s;equence, give full &s;cope to dome&s;tic &s;trife; and the Americans who&s;e union was cemented by danger, who regulated their conduct as much as po&s;|&s;ible by the e&s;tabli&s;hed laws of civilized nations, and who were anxious not to di&s;grace their cau&s;e by the licentious ferocity of &s;avages?</P>

di&s;tre&s;&s;ed by a revolutionary &s;truggle; which the one had means of bringing to a &s;ucce&s;sful conclu&s;ion, of which the other is totally de&s;titute. A contempla|tion of the progre&s;s of the American Revolution proves that paper money is not a permanent re&s;ource; and the circum&s;tances attending that of France prove that, when her paper-money fails, &s;he will find no &s;ub&s;titute.</P>
<P>I cannot too often repeat that nothing &s;hort of this failure will convince the French of the ab&s;olute nece&s;|&s;ity of agreeing to a full re&s;titution of their conque&s;ts.

<P>A Peace on &s;uch conditions, I con&s;ider as &s;o ine&s;ti|mably valuable, and as &s;o certain a reward of fortitude on their part, that even if we were to begin this cam|paign with the melancholy certainty that at the end of it there would be no material alteration in the mili|tary &s;ituation of the two armies,&mdash;yet &s;till, no &s;acri|fices &s;hould be &s;pared, becau&s;e no &s;acrifices can be too great, when the object is to drive back and confine within their own country the&s;e modern Goths and Vandals, who have already conceived the de&s;ign of overrunning the re&s;t of Europe.

<P>IN attempting to form a conjecture of the probable i&s;&s;ue of a war, merely from a view of the pecuniary re&s;ources of the contending Powers, it is not enough to &s;hew that tho&s;e of one of the parties are on the point of being totally exhau&s;ted, unle&s;s we al&s;o prove that tho&s;e of its antagoni&s;t are in &s;uch a &s;tate as to enable it &s;till to continue the conte&s;t.</P>
<P>To avoid any imputation of blending re&s;ources which may po&s;&s;ibly be thought doubtful, with tho&s;e which we can demon&s;trate to be real; in cal|culating the means which the Allies have of pay|ing the future expences of the war, we will only take into the account tho&s;e of Great-Britain, and will even &s;uppo&s;e it po&s;&s;ible that the whole of them mu&s;t be furni&s;hed by her.

<P>This conci&s;e view of the pre&s;ent re&s;ources of Great-Britain, is drawn from well-known facts, and authentic accounts; and is, I imagine, quite enough to decide on her ability to continue the war as long as it can, by any po&s;&s;ible means, be pro|tracted by her enemy.</P>

cur&s;ed Great-Britain with a national debt; a gulf which, in&s;tead of being filled up, is con|tinually growing wider and wider, and into which this vain nation is falling, which believes her&s;elf the riche&s;t in Europe, only becau&s;e all Europe does not contain &s;o much money as &s;he owes her&s;elf.</Q></P>
<P>Nearly &s;uch as this was the language of Dr. Price at about the &s;ame period of the la&s;t war; and which has been &s;o completely refuted by experience. The&s;e antiquated declamations on the national debt of Great-Britain, which are &s;till &s;o fa&s;hionable abroad among the partizans of the French, may be completely an&s;wered, by ob&s;erving&mdash;1&s;t, That &s;he cannot be di&s;tre&s;&s;ed by a &s;udden call upon her for the capital of the debt, becau&s;e it is not demandable; 2dly, That effectual means have been provided for its extinction; and, 3dly, That the payment of the intere&s;t is perfectly &s;ecure.

<P>But another objection is fa&s;hionable with the &s;ame cla&s;s of political arithmeticians, on the continent.&mdash; <Q>If (&s;ay they) the taxes of Great-Britain, of which the produce has hitherto been adequate to her pre&s;ent debt, go on increa&s;ing continually in a proportion adequate to the increa&s;e of that debt; if, notwith&s;tanding their pre&s;ent immen&s;e amount, they are added to year after year; they mu&s;t at la&s;t become more in&s;upportably heavy than tho&s;e taxes which have occa&s;ioned in&s;urrections in other countries; and can it be expected that the people will then &s;o patiently &s;ubmit to them? And,

be&s;ides, if this pretended public wealth re&s;ults entirely from privations to which the individuals who compo&s;e the State mu&s;t &s;ubmit, the whole is merely a confu&s;ion of ideas.</Q></P>
<P>Either I am very much mi&s;taken, or there is no other confu&s;ion than what re&s;ults from mis-&s;tating the argument; which may be ea&s;ily put in a clearer point of view by con&s;idering, that the comparative burden of taxes on any families or nations, is not to be e&s;timated by the &s;terling amount of the &s;ums which they pay, but by the proportion which tho&s;e &s;ums re|&s;pectively bear to the incomes which they derive from property or indu&s;try.</P>
<P>Let this rule be applied to the taxes paid by the people of Great-Britain; and it will be found that though their amount, when compared with the popu|lation, is perhaps greater than in any con&s;iderable country, Holland excepted, yet there is no country which &s;upports its government almo&s;t entirely by public contributions,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The words <HI>which &s;upports its government almo&s;t entirely by public contributions,</HI> are introduced into the text, becau&s;e in &s;ome countries the whole, and in others a great pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">t, of the public expences are paid by the revenue of lands belonging to the State; for in|&s;tance, the militia of Sweden, and almo&s;t the whole public ex|pences of &s;ome of the Swi&s;s Cantons.</NOTE> where the burden is &s;o lightly felt: the weight which &s;inks inferior animals to the earth, is hardly perceived when borne by the elephant. But, in fact, the people of Great-Britain feel le&s;s than any other the burden of taxation, for the following rea&s;ons: 1&s;t, It is the only country where tho&s;e who are poor pay le&s;s in proportion to their incomes than the&s;e who are rich. 2dly, This takes place in a wi&s;e gradation, from the lowe&s;t to the highe&s;t of the community; many taxes being a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in an increa|&s;ing ratio, regulated by circum&s;tances which indicate a proportionate increa&s;e of wealth, and others being of a nature which confines their operation almo&s;t ex|clu&s;ively to the opulent. 3dly, There is no country
<PB N="56" REF="048483_0057_1025336B80AB18C8">
where the mode of collecting them is &s;o little vexa|tious, or the means of providing for the demand, &s;o ready; in con&s;equence of a facility in exchanging property, or procuring money on its credit, which in mo&s;t other countries is unknown.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>It may urged as an objection to my argument, that the great proprietors of Germany and Italy pay much le&s;s in proportion than tho&s;e of the &s;ame cla&s;s and de&s;cription in England: but this objection does not meet my argument, and indeed proceeds upon a mi&s;apprehen&s;ion of it. What I mean is, that it is not the po&s;itive weight borne by any individual in Great-Britain, that gives &s;uch an advantage to the &s;y&s;tem of taxation adopted in that country, over that which prevails in every other part of Europe; but it is the equity with which the public burden is di&s;tributed in propor|tion to the abilities of tho&s;e who are to bear it.</P>
<P>This equitable principle of taxation is every year more and more attended to; and its operation is &s;uch, that there is good rea&s;on to believe, that the great labouring body of the community, who&s;e expences, reckoned by families, are generally from twenty to thirty pounds a year, do not pay more to the State than at the rate of three per cent.&mdash;If we a&s;&s;ume the next cla&s;s as made up of tho&s;e who, by families, expend from thirty to fifty pounds a year, and which includes the higher order of artizans, inferior farmers and trade&s;men, &amp;c. what they contribute may be averaged at about five or &s;ix per cent.&mdash;The rate of contribution goes on in a con|tinually increa&s;ing progre&s;&s;ion to the highe&s;t cla&s;&s;es, &s;o that the families included in them, which if their revenue ari&s;es exclu&s;ively from real property, and they &s;pend the whole of it, do not pay to the State le&s;s than from thirty to fifty per cent.</P>
<P>The effect of a wi&s;e di&s;tribution of taxes (provided the revenue derived from them returns to the community) is &s;uch, that they bear heavily on no individual, becau&s;e a general circulation di|vides that revenue in &s;uch a way, that each man's income improves in proportion as he contributes. Not that this circum&s;tance, which is true only to a certain extent, &s;hould operate as an encourage|ment to lay on additional burdens, or make Government indifferent as to the manner in which they are laid on; on the contrary, it mu&s;t not be forgotten, that taxes, particularly when laid on the poor, dimini&s;h the means of reproduction, and con&s;equently t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">e re&s;ources of taxation, which it is of &s;uch importance to re&s;erve for extraordinary emergencies.</P>
<P>This hypothe&s;is, I am aware, involves a que&s;tion of mere political economy, and may be more or le&s;s conte&s;ted. But to return to the main que&s;tion, whether tho&s;e cla&s;&s;es of &s;ociety, which in Great-Britain bear the greate&s;t &s;hare of the burden of taxes, are not able to &s;upport an increa&s;e of that burden, and even willing to do it; in an&s;wer to this que&s;tion, I appeal to the following circum&s;tan|ces. That the taxes of the pre&s;ent &s;e&s;&s;ion, amounting to 1,645,000<ABBR>l.</ABBR> &s;terling a year, fall almo&s;t exclu&s;ively on tho&s;e cla&s;&s;es, and yet no taxes ever met with le&s;s oppo&s;ition: That the benevo|lent in&s;titutions &s;upported by public &s;ub&s;cription, which in this country are infinitely more numerous than in any other, indi|cate the wealth as well as the charitable di&s;po&s;ition of the country, which was never more univer&s;al, or more abundant, than during the late &s;evere winter. If the incomes of the rich were injuriou&s;ly dimini&s;hed, the inclination might have remained, but the means would have been wanting; whereas tho&s;e contributions were &s;o great, particularly in towns, that many per&s;ons think the poor were even better provided for, than in common winters, when they could work with more convenience.</P>
<P>As there can be no &s;tronger proof of the opinion which they who &s;upport the greater part of the burden of the war, entertain of the nece&s;&s;ity (under the pre&s;ent circum&s;tances) of continuing it, than their cheerfully &s;ubmitting to an addition of taxes, to the annual amount of 2,785,000<ABBR>l</ABBR>, impo&s;ed within the &s;hort &s;pace of three years; &s;o there can hardly be a &s;tronger proof of the wealth of this nation, and of the increa&s;e of that wealth, notwith&s;tanding the war, than that &s;carce any of tho&s;e works which increa&s;e the re&s;ources of a nation, by facilitating reproduction, &s;uch as canals, &amp;c. &amp;c. have either been &s;u&s;pended, or carried on with le&s;s activity, than before the war. The capital which the war has hitherto diverted out of its channel, is not that which is u&s;ually employed in increa&s;ing the wealth of a country, by facili|tating the means of reproduction; but it is principally that which is u&s;ually &s;pent in increa&s;ing the comforts, and adding to the elegancies of life.</P>
<P>But to return to the que&s;tion, from which I perhaps appear to have been wandering: there are two other ways of determining whether the Engli&s;h nation, taken at large, is more or le&s;s taxed than others.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t is, to compare the annual revenues of the inhabitants, with the &s;um which they pay to the State. Now, many political calculators e&s;timate the annual reproduction of Great-Britain (meaning the whole income derived from lands, indu&s;try, and money) at nearly double the amount of that of France, in her days of pro&s;perity; and they &s;upport this e&s;timate by the circum&s;tance that Great-Britain, after having &s;upplied its own con&s;umption, exported a &s;urplus produce twice as great as that of France, which amounted only to about twelve millions &s;terling; whereas the ex|<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">orts of Great-Britain amounted, in 1792, to twenty-five millions &s;terling. But let us even &s;uppo&s;e the incomes of the two nations only equal; then, as the public revenue of France, before the re|volution, amounted to about twenty-four millions &s;terling, and that of Great-Britain, before the war, to about &s;ixteen millions, it is clear that the former, even admitting the incomes of the two king|doms to be equal, paid 124/100 while the latter paid no more than 16/100. But admitting what was probably the fact, that the income of Great-Britain was double that of France, the &s;um actually rai&s;ed upon the former, would be to that rai&s;ed upon the latter, in the pro|portion of 8/100 to 24/100, that is, in proportion of one to three.</P>
<P>If this mode of compari&s;on &s;hould appear uncertain, there is another more &s;ure, and which leads to a conclu&s;ion &s;till more favour|able to Great-Britain; it is, to compare the &s;um &s;he pays to Government, with the balance of her trade. Thus if Great-Britain in the year 1792, increa&s;ed, I do not &s;ay her circulating &s;pecie, which is not to the purpo&s;e, but her productive capital, to the amount of 5,245,842<ABBR>l.</ABBR> &s;terling, by the balance of her foreign trade; this balance amounted to nearly one third of all that was paid to Government. And here another ob&s;ervation &s;hould be made, that this annual augmentation of the public wealth, increa&s;es the means of paying the public contributions in the &s;ucceeding year.</P>
<P>Next to England, France was the State who&s;e commercial ba|lance was the mo&s;t favourable, and Necker &s;uppo&s;ed that it amounted annually to near three millions &s;terling: the French therefore had to add to the profit they derived from their foreign trade more than &s;even times its amount, in order to pay the public contributions, whereas Great-Britain has only to add twice as much.</P>
<P>Let the other nations of Europe, who talk of the heavy taxes of Great-Britain, &s;ubmit their own to the &s;ame te&s;t.</P></NOTE> If the&s;e rea&s;ons
<PB N="57" REF="048483_0058_10253373E4E04AD8">
are inconclu&s;ive, we mu&s;t admit that the Savoyards, who, though the amount of their taxes, compared with
<PB N="58" REF="048483_0059_1025337E1F385AF8">
their population, was trifling; yet, comparing that amount with their poverty, were perhaps the mo&s;t ag|grieved by them of any people in Europe; that they mu&s;t be con&s;idered as being taxed only one twelfth part as heavily as Great-Britain, becau&s;e, in propor|tion to their number, their taxes were but one twelfth part as productive.</P>
<P>The only way of judging in what degree the taxes in any country are burden&s;ome to the people, and to what extent they may be increa&s;ed upon emergencies, is, fir&s;t to a&s;certain the actual opulence of that country, and then inve&s;tigate the &s;ources of that opulence, in order to di&s;cover whether they are likely to become more abundant, and to be permanent. If &s;uch an inve&s;tigation gives rea&s;on to believe that the opulence
<PB N="59" REF="048483_0060_10253382C69958A8">
of Great-Britain has increa&s;ed in any period to a given extent, her inhabitants need not be alarmed, if at the end of that period they find her public burdens in|crea&s;ed in a proportionate extent.</P>
<P>The value of the reproductions in Great-Britain, and of the accumulation of every &s;pecies of wealth within her, has been for many years increa&s;ing with a rapidity which has refuted the pre&s;ages of melan|choly politicians, and excited the envy of her neigh|bours; and in &s;uch a &s;ituation, &s;he ought not &s;o much to be afraid of &s;acrifices which her pro&s;perity enables her to make, as to be cautious, that neither the violence of her enemies, nor the indi&s;creet impa|tience of the advocates of immediate peace, &s;ucceed in depriving her of tho&s;e &s;ources from which her pro|&s;perity is derived. They are, at home, her agriculture and her manufactures, protected and encouraged by her Con&s;titution; and abroad, her commerce, of which the balance of power in Europe is the &s;hield.</P>
<P>Europe is the be&s;t market for her commerce; and her acce&s;s to that market upon equal terms, as well as the opulence of tho&s;e who trade with her in it, and which con&s;titutes the value of it, depend, immediately, upon the tranquillity and independence of the nations which inhabit it; and ultimately, on the balance of power, by which that tranquillity and independence is e&s;&s;entially protected; &s;o that the principal &s;ource of Briti&s;h opulence, that &s;tream which fertilizes her fields, and moves the various mechani&s;m of her mines, and manufactures, may be lo&s;t for ever, if &s;he &s;uffers the mo&s;t formidable nation in Europe to increa&s;e an influ|ence, always ho&s;tilely directed, by any augmentation of her territory; or by allowing her to retain any politi|cal a&s;cendency which &s;he has gained by her pre&s;ent &s;ucce&s;s. The culpable la&s;&s;itude which could purcha&s;e peace on &s;uch conditions, would certainly be puni&s;hed by a decay of foreign trade, and a diminution of inter|nal wealth, as rapid as its late increa&s;e has been.</P>

<P>And as to the French, though hitherto &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful, do they imagine that even if a peace &s;hould now be made with them, leaving them in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their conque&s;ts, it would be more du|rable, or that po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion le&s;s de&s;tructively conte&s;ted on the fir&s;t op|portunity, than that of Sile&s;ia was with Frederic? Do they think that the Princes from whom tho&s;e conque&s;ts are made, and tho&s;e to whom the power of France is an object of alarm, will not, on the fir&s;t con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of returning &s;trength on their part, and of debility on the part of their enemies, league together again to drive them back to their former boundary? How is it that they do not yet ob&s;erve that the mea&s;ures which they are pur&s;uing can lead to nothing more than a peace in name; but, in fact, a mere jealous &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of war; and that the per&s;everance of the Bri|ti&s;h Government is a demon&s;tration that the peace which it wi&s;hes for, is not a truce, a mere ce&s;&s;ation of ho&s;tilities, till means can be found to renew them with greater advantage, but a peace which will be &s;incere and durable.</P>
<P>In fact, it is the ambition of territorial aggrandizement, that in|born pa&s;&s;ion of France, which at pre&s;ent induces her to detach, one by one, the Powers who are at war with her, by partial compromi&s;es. The leaders of that nation well know that the Briti&s;h Govern|ment will never allow the territorial aggrandi&s;ement of France in a general Congre&s;s for Peace; and therefore their object is to &s;e|cure the quiet po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the conque&s;ts which they wi&s;h to retain, by previous and partial treaties.</P>
<P>If this be really their motive, let us examine the good policy of it. For the precarious po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a few de&s;olated provinces, the French condemn them&s;elves to per&s;i&s;t in a conte&s;t with the mo&s;t formidable member of the league again&s;t them; to remain with harbours blocked up, provi&s;ions intercepted; and entangled in a &s;pecies of war, for which, of all others, they are the mo&s;t unfit; and for which, of all others, they have the fewe&s;t internal means of providing the materials, and con&s;equently can derive the lea&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;tance from their a&s;&s;ignats.</P>
<P>They have not perhaps yet di&s;covered that, in proportion as their plan of partial treaties is adopted, Great-Britain becomes relieved from the mo&s;t burden&s;ome part of the war. Once freed by the defection of her Allies from the obligation to make a common cau&s;e with them, &s;he would be left free to exert all her force in the way mo&s;t advantageous to her&s;elf. Though the iron frontier of France has proved impenetrable to the armies of Europe, yet her coa&s;ts are no where inacce&s;&s;ible. The di&s;tant po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of France mu&s;t inevitably become a permanent acqui&s;ition to Great-Britain: 1&s;t, Becau&s;e &s;he would be under no obligation to re&s;tore them, as the condition of any re&s;titution to be made by France; 2dly, Becau&s;e the conque&s;ts once made, by ruining the trade, and con|&s;equently de&s;troying the nur&s;ery of the marine of France, would deprive her of the means of ever regaining them; 3dly, Becau&s;e tho&s;e di&s;tant po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions having little or no influence on the balance of power in Europe, France would never be materially &s;upported by the great Continental Powers in her attempt to regain them.</P>
<P>Another circum&s;tance which they overlook, is the &s;mall value of their conque&s;ts, when compared with that of the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions which in that ca&s;e they mu&s;t lo&s;e, the one not being in their full extent one-fourth part as valuable as the other We find by the report of Johannot, made the 22d of December, that the returns from their colonies are now &s;u&s;pended, which by the &s;ame report amounted, in 1788, to 235 millions (9,791,666<ABBR>l.</ABBR> &s;terling).</P>
<P>Soon perhaps the Convention will find that their people will open their eyes to this circum&s;tance, and the words of Mr. Necker, will every where be repeated. <HI>What would be the con&s;equence, if by neglecting &s;uch valuable po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, or by lo&s;ing them, France &s;hould find her&s;elf deprived of that balance of commerce, which &s;he annually gains by exporting the produce of her colonies? What would be the con&s;equence, if, be&s;ides this, &s;he &s;hould be obliged to purcha&s;e from other nations, that part of their produce which &s;he wants for her own con|&s;umption? Such a Revolution would &s;end out of France annually more &s;pecie than &s;he now receives.</HI> Admini&s;tr. of Fin. Vol. II. ch. 3.</P>
<P>But the ab&s;urdity of the pre&s;ent leaders of the French, is not greater than the inju&s;tice with which the Author of <HI>Reflections on Peace</HI> reproaches Mr. Pitt <HI>with not being frightened at the very riches of Great-Britain, which have only been accumulated by the ruin of her Allies.</HI> p. 30.</P>
<P>If ever Great-Britain gave inconte&s;table proofs of moral recti|tude and di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s, it is &s;urely in the pre&s;ent war.

And this que&s;tion clearly hinges on the four points which I have attempted to examine. 1&s;t, Whether the pre&s;ervation of the &s;ources of Briti&s;h pro&s;perity, does not e&s;&s;entially depend on the equi|poi&s;e, the independence, and the tranquillity of Eu|rope? 2dly, Whether that equipoi&s;e will not be ab&s;o|lutely de&s;troyed, and her independence and tranquil|lity be continually in danger, from the moment that France is left in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of any part of her con|que&s;ts? 3dly, Whether the near annihilation of the only re&s;ource which, during the war, &s;he can make productive, does not give a better chance of depri|ving her of her conque&s;ts by per&s;everance? 4thly, Whether the re&s;ources of Great-Britain alone are not
<PB N="63" REF="048483_0064_102533CBC0873930">
fully adequate to the expences of the war, during any probable calculation of its continuance; and whether their condition is &s;uch, as to give the French any &s;hadow of rea&s;on for the hope which they &s;o fondly cheri&s;h, of accompli&s;hing their ruin, by protracting the war; a hope which has in&s;tigated a great part of their unprecedented exertions; and which now is the only probable cau&s;e of their apparent unwillingne&s;s to terminate the war, at lea&s;t with Great-Britain.</P>
<P>I am aware that many per&s;ons on the Continent, who know no more of Great-Britain than what they read in the parliamentary debates, believe literally all the melancholy predictions of Oppo&s;ition, and all tho&s;e tales of misfortune, on which, as u&s;ual, &s;o much &s;tre&s;s is laid, whenever tho&s;e who are adver&s;e to the mea&s;ures or the members of Admini&s;tration, think proper to paint the di&s;a&s;trous effects of a war which they blame, and the immediate urgency of a peace which they re|commend. Struck, no doubt, with the eloquence with which Mr. Fox has de&s;cribed the aby&s;s into which the ob&s;tinacy of Admini&s;tration is plunging this country, by prolonging &s;o hopele&s;s a war&mdash;the Author of <HI>Reflections on Peace</HI> brings him forward to corroborate <HI>the evidence of the dangers</HI> of every kind, internal as well as external, from which nothing but a peace can pre&s;erve Great-Britain.</P>
<P>So much re&s;pect is due to the authority of Mr. Fox, that I would readily let the opinion of the fide|lity of my &s;tatement of the re&s;ources of Great-Bri|tain re&s;t on his te&s;timony. I go farther:&mdash;if Mr. Fox had been at the head of admini&s;tration, and it had been proved to him that the French were determined to retain any part of their conque&s;ts; that the leaders of the Convention do not de&s;ire a general peace, or at lea&s;t that they do not wi&s;h for it but <HI>by partial ones;</HI> that if they no longer per&s;i&s;t in declaring that they will not &s;ign it <HI>but on the ruins of the modern Carthage,</HI> yet they &s;till tell their countrymen <HI>that the true guarantee of

I rather imagine that, if &s;uch a map of France were of|fered him for his &s;ignature, he would not have the lea&s;t difficulty in affirming on his part, that, rather than &s;ubmit to &s;uch terms, Great-Britain ought to continue her pre&s;ent expence for years to come; that &s;he is able, and will be able to do &s;o; and that &s;he mu&s;t not put the evils which &s;he has already borne, or may &s;till be obliged to bear, in competition with the far greater, though not &s;o immediate evils which they enable her to avoid. I believe too, that, in&s;tead of fancying that <HI>multiplied di&s;a&s;ters would wear out Europe and England within a year</HI><NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Reflections on Peace, <HI>p. 23.</HI></NOTE>, Mr. Fox would exert all his talents to prevent tho&s;e di&s;a&s;ters, by doubling the mili|tary exertions of the country, if nece&s;&s;ary; and would not con&s;ent to &s;heath the &s;word, until, holding it with a <HI>&s;trong hand,</HI> he had <HI>traced the limits of the French Republic;</HI> that is, until he had deprived her of all her conque&s;ts, and de&s;troyed her influence in Holland. I am led to this opinion by his decided approbation of the conduct of Mr. Pitt in 1787 for taking an ac|tive part, in concert with Pru&s;&s;ia, again&s;t the Anti-Stadholderian party in Holland. He not only went &s;o far as to call that party <HI>u&s;urpers;</HI><NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot"><P>At the ri&s;k perhaps of being thought pre&s;umptuous, I will not di&s;&s;emble that the conduct of the Briti&s;h Mini&s;ter, on that occa&s;ion, has always appeared to me to be le&s;s di&s;tingui&s;hed by his u&s;ual wi&s;|dom and fore&s;ight, than any other of his mea&s;ures.</P>
<P>It is not for having interfered in the Dutch Revolution that I think him to blame; for in that he was fully ju&s;tified in the pre|vious interference and ab&s;urd intrigues of that weak, but bu&s;y Mini&s;ter, the Count de <HI>Vergennes,</HI> who took the &s;ame pains to carry Democracy to exce&s;s in Holland, as to cru&s;h the limited De|mocracy of Geneva. But did Great-Britain, after de&s;troying the French intere&s;t in Holland, avail her&s;elf of her influence with the Dutch, as &s;he might have done, to induce them to adopt a form of government better adapted to the intere&s;ts of both nations? This I doubted long before the events which have lately happened, and which have changed tho&s;e doubts to certainty. If I venture to ex|plain my rea&s;ons now, it is becau&s;e I think it cannot be long be|fore the &s;ame circum&s;tances will recur.</P>
<P>The greater part of the Dutch Patriots were men of real inte|grity. The object which they meant to gain was liberty; and they &s;et out with very good intentions, but in a road of which they had very little knowledge. They complained of the authority of the Stadtholder as a yoke; and did not di&s;cover that if it was a yoke, the rea&s;on of its being &s;o was becau&s;e it was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of certain powers by no means &s;uited to his &s;ituation as Supreme Chief, and which he might be tempted to mi&s;u&s;e; while at the &s;ame time he was not allowed other prerogatives, much more e&s;&s;ential to that &s;ituation, and which can only be employed to the public advantage. They exclaimed again&s;t Great-Britain, and accu&s;ed her of meaning to make the Hou&s;e of Orange among them what the Hou&s;e of Hanover is here; and the prejudice of party hindered them from &s;eeing that the greate&s;t po&s;&s;ible &s;ervice which &s;he could have rendered them, would have been preci&s;ely to have de&s;erved this accu&s;ation, by inducing the Stadtholder to exchange his political powers, for the prerogatives of the Briti&s;h Kings, and per&s;uading the people at large that the exchange would be for its advantage.</P>
<P>This ine&s;timable u&s;e I have thought that the Briti&s;h Mini&s;ter might po&s;&s;ibly have made of the immen&s;e influence he had in the Revolution of 1787. That Revolution terminated only in the momentary defeat of a numerous party; whereas it might have ended in a &s;olid improvement of the &s;ituation of the Hou&s;e of Orange, and of the people, &s;atisfying almo&s;t equally both parties, and con&s;olidating the connexion between the two countries.</P>
<P>So noble an enterpri&s;e would, no doubt, have been &s;ubject to many difficulties in the execution; but which might, I imagine, have been &s;urmounted by judicious conduct, and lenient mea&s;ures. The triumphant party was &s;o completely under the influence of Great-Britain and Pru&s;&s;ia, that it could not have re&s;i&s;ted, even if it could be &s;uppo&s;ed &s;o ignorant of its own intere&s;ts as to have attempted it. As to the other party, it thought of nothing but e&s;caping the con&s;equences of defeat; and I am much deceived if tho&s;e who compo&s;ed it would not then have accepted the Engli&s;h Con&s;titution with tran&s;port. I am &s;till more mi&s;taken if that Con&s;titution, once in activity, would have allowed it&s;elf to have been &s;upplanted by the Tree of French Liberty.</P>
<P>However, another opportunity may &s;oon offer. Heretofore the Hollanders have complained of the Stadtholderian Ari&s;tocracy; they have now experienced the far greater oppre&s;&s;ion of the Demo|cracy of 1795: now more than ever they may be di&s;po&s;ed to unite in forming a rational Con&s;titution, protecting them from both; and the be&s;t pattern they can imitate is the Briti&s;h Con&s;titution, which it would have been &s;till more ea&s;y to introduce in Holland than in France.</P></NOTE> but he added,

<P>He reminded the Hou&s;e <Q>how repeatedly he had urged the treachery of France in the exer|tion of her influence in foreign States, even by arguments which had frequently been thought too &s;trong;</Q>&mdash;how often he had urged his apprehen|&s;ions of the views of aggrandi&s;ement entertained by her, of her perfidious &s;y&s;tem of politics, and her adroit per&s;everance in intriguing, to gain an influ|ence in the governments in her neighbourhood, and of the extreme danger of tru&s;ting to her profe&s;&s;ions of good faith. <Q>As for him, (added he) he did not wi&s;h to re&s;t upon French declarations, or upon any French profe&s;&s;ions, whether perfectly made, or clearly expre&s;&s;ed or not.</Q></P>
<P><HI>On the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion, he gave his full a&s;&s;ent to the addre&s;s, which he con&s;idered as a public avowal from the Throne, and as public an acknowledgment on the part of that Hou&s;e, that tho&s;e &s;y&s;tems of politics, which had, at preceding periods, been called romantic, were &s;erious &s;y&s;tems, and &s;uch as it was the true intere&s;t of the country to be governed by; &s;y&s;tems e&s;tabli&s;hed on that &s;ound and &s;olid political maxim, that Great-Britain ought to look to the &s;ituation of affairs upon the Conti|nent, and to take &s;uch mea&s;ures, upon every change

<ARGUMENT>
<P>In&s;urmountable Ob&s;tacles prevent France from remaining a Republic. It is of the utmo&s;t importance to her to avoid an elective Chief; and to return to a Monarchy, hereditary, but limited.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>WILL the Republic, one, indivi&s;ible, and demo|cratic, be e&s;tabli&s;hed in France? Will that great political body divide it&s;elf into Cantons, confederated like Swi&s;&s;erland? Will it adopt an elective Chief like the United States of America? Will not the French go back to their Con&s;titution of 1791? Will they not, when weary of change, &s;eek a refuge in their for|mer de&s;poti&s;m? Will they not imitate the hereditary and limited Monarchy of Great-Britain?</P>
<P>The fir&s;t of the&s;e que&s;tions is the only one on which I think we may, as yet, give a decided judgment; and if, with re&s;pect to that, I venture an opinion, after &s;o many &s;peculations have failed, it is becau&s;e I am con|vinced that the third year of the French Republic has furni&s;hed <HI>data</HI> from which we can almo&s;t with cer|tainty affirm that the curtain will &s;oon drop before this Republican Drama.</P>
<P>Let it not be &s;aid that their language is as repub|lican as ever; for, as to the French nation, what &s;igni|fies the opinion of to-day, compared with the events which may change it to-morrow? Be&s;ides, I am very much deceived, if by this time there are not, even at

Paris, many more royali&s;ts, concealed under the di&s;gui&s;e of republicans, than there were republicans four years ago under the di&s;gui&s;e of royali&s;ts. I have for &s;ome time &s;u&s;pected that even the pre&s;ent le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ders of the Convention are not &s;o republican as they pre|tend; for if they were, they &s;urely would not dream of extending the territory of France, already, beyond a doubt, &s;o large as to be an in&s;urmountable difficulty in the way of their &s;y&s;tem.</P>
<P>If tho&s;e leaders were ever &s;incerely attached to that &s;y&s;tem, it could only be in the commencement of their revolutionary career; for the mi&s;ery, the fears, and the per&s;onal dangers which tho&s;e who &s;urvive of the Girondi&s;t faction have undergone, mu&s;t have opened their eyes long before the public di&s;tre&s;s was great enough to open the eyes of the multitude. I would a&s;k tho&s;e Frenchmen of character and principle, who became Democrats only from exaggerated notions of human virtue,&mdash;do they &s;till believe that the virtues and the talents which &s;ecure admiration and deference in private life, will be equally preeminent and com|manding in a crowd? I would refer this que&s;tion to the con&s;cience of that member of the Convention who, about three months ago, once more &s;olicited his col|leagues to ha&s;ten the <HI>magnificent enterpri&s;e of forming a Democracy of twenty-four millions of men;</HI> or rather, I would decide it by that &s;ame member's eloquent de&s;criptions in his di&s;cour&s;e <HI>on terror.</HI> Every page of the hi&s;tory of every great Republic, will decide it; for there virtue is &s;een &s;uffering and &s;ilenced, while the &s;elfi&s;h pa&s;&s;ions only di&s;play them&s;elves, and tri|umph.</P>
<P>One truth by this time the French ought to have learned in their &s;chool of adver&s;ity&mdash;that they have, in no re&s;pect whatever, the moral character which is in|di&s;pen&s;able for a popular government. To be fit for it, a nation mu&s;t have education and moral habits unknown in France, and which can only be acquired

A republican ought to have that &s;ort of di&s;cernment which can di&s;tingui&s;h between faction and patrioti&s;m; between tho&s;e who would agitate the people, and tho&s;e who would protect them: he ought to have mode&s;ty enough to reverence the experience of age, and to give place on all occa&s;ions to &s;uperior talents. A republican government requires the &s;tricte&s;t and mo&s;t con&s;tant ob&s;ervation of &s;ocial duties; it requires that parental and conjugal authority, that every dome&s;tic virtue, &s;hould come in aid of public force; it requires the moderated warmth which animates debate, and the wi&s;e circum&s;pection which re&s;trains it within due limits. A Republic, to &s;upport it&s;elf, mu&s;t con&s;i&s;t of a people which knows where to &s;top, when party degenerates into faction;&mdash;of a people au&s;tere in manners, grave in character, not ha&s;ty in giving its confidence, or changing its opinions; a people which has either the phlegm of the Dutch, the tardine&s;s of the Swi&s;s, the &s;agacity of Genoa, the prudence of Venice, or the information which Ame|rica has derived from the Engli&s;h &s;chool of Liberty. If ever the French &s;hould attain to &s;o many qualities foreign to their nature, it will be a mo&s;t extraordinary metamorpho&s;is; one which nothing can ever effect but the gradual operation of a free Monarchy.

In the &s;ixty-&s;econd letter of his New Eloi&s;a, Vol. I, he makes an Engli&s;h Peer &s;ay, <Q>We are not the &s;laves of the Prince, but his friends; we are not the tyrants of the people, but its chiefs.

<P><HI>Hereditary crowns</HI> (Rou&s;&s;eau &s;till goes on) <HI>expo&s;e a nation to have mon&s;ters and fools at its head.</HI> Such an event is not impo&s;&s;ible, and, I acknowledge, is di&s;tre&s;&s;|ing: but human wi&s;dom cannot devi&s;e a better pro|vi&s;ion again&s;t this evil than the checks of a limited Monarchy. The great object of that &s;y&s;tem is, to give the State rather an o&s;ten&s;ible than real chief; and to depo&s;it in other hands, &s;uch an influence over his appointment of Mini&s;ters, that the nation may &s;ecurely confide in their abilities; and, whatever benefit it may derive from his virtues, may have little or nothing to fear from his vices. And, not to mention the tempe&s;tuous interregnums where crowns are elective, if it be true that by that &s;y&s;tem a fool rarely &s;its on the throne, it is equally true that intrigue is the only way to it: intrigue almo&s;t always elevates to it &s;ome man of dangerous am|bition; frequently &s;ome mean in&s;trument of the enemies of his country, who rai&s;e him to the throne for the purpo&s;e of &s;ubjugating it.</P>

In fact, it provides &s;o perfect a &s;ecurity again&s;t the immorality of the &s;upreme Chief, that I &s;hould be almo&s;t di&s;po&s;ed to be more apprehen&s;ive of his virtues if too &s;plendid, than of his vices.

let the crown be placed on the head of a woman, or a child, it is comparatively of little con&s;e|quence, &s;o it be placed &s;omewhere, and previou&s;ly &s;ettled. In truth, though the Monarch holds the &s;cep|tre, and in the choice of tho&s;e whom he employs as his &s;ervants is under no legal re&s;traint whatever, yet in the exerci&s;e of that choice he is nece&s;&s;arily &s;o much &s;wayed by prudential con&s;iderations, that he not un|frequently finds him&s;elf obliged to give up his own wi&s;hes in the nomination of his Mini&s;ters, and to be guided in it by preeminence of talents and public opinion.</P>
<P>We mu&s;t then come to this conclu&s;ion, adds Rou&s;|&s;eau; <HI>we mu&s;t declare that the King can do no wrong.</HI> And what is there &s;o alarming in this fiction (if it can be called a <HI>fiction</HI>), when effectual precautions have been taken to prevent his doing any wrong; when his &s;ubjects are better able to re&s;i&s;t an attack, than he is to make it; and when he can do no act of government without his Mini&s;ters, and of cour&s;e the whole re&s;pon&s;ibility falls upon them?</P>

<P>This author is perfectly right in the ob&s;ervation contained in the preceding &s;entence: in Great-Britain the whole civil li&s;t, con&s;iderable as the &s;um is, does not amount to more than one per cent. of the income of the people, computing it at the lowe&s;t rate; but, upon a much more probable conjecture, not to &frac12; per cent. And this is the only fair way of comparing the civil expences of any two countries. But that civil li&s;t is not (as many foreigners imagine, and as is &s;ometimes in&s;inuated at home) exclu&s;ively employed to &s;upport the maje&s;ty of the throne; but is &s;trictly a civil, and not a royal li&s;t including the &s;tipends of a very great number of per&s;ons in the &s;ervice of the State, in offices without which no &s;ort of government can exi&s;t; &s;uch as Judges, Secretaries, Amba&s;&s;adors, &amp;c. &amp;c.</P></NOTE></P>

<P>I need not &s;ay that by &s;uch a Chief, Mr. Adams does not mean, either that &s;hadow of Royalty ap|pointed by the French Con&s;titution of 1791, a King in name, but in fact nothing more than an expen&s;ive and u&s;ele&s;s pen&s;ioner; nor the office of Stadtholder in Hol|land,

pride. Far from &s;uffering them&s;elves to be &s;e|duced by the political reveries of Rou&s;&s;eau, who&s;e dying advice to them was to attach them&s;elves more and more to their republican forms, and never to give up the right of electing their &s;upreme chief; but reduce him, by little and little, to a mere image of a King&mdash;far from being mi&s;&s;ed by &s;uch &s;ugge&s;tions, they at la&s;t begun to have true notions of liberty, and directed their political views to a Con&s;titution approaching to that of Great-Britain. Hardly was the &s;tandard of real liberty rai&s;ed among them, before all their &s;canda|lous competitions were forgotten, and the proude&s;t of their ari&s;tocracy ranged them&s;elves under the banners of Ko&s;ciu&s;ko, in defence of a Con&s;titution which controuled their own ambition, and was full of happy pro&s;pects for the people. If in the enfeebled &s;tate of that nation there was any thing like a hope of &s;ucce&s;s in their attempt to &s;ub&s;titute a rational Con&s;titution for a turbulent Ari&s;tocracy and an elective Monarchy, it certainly was the ability and intrepid moderation of their leader. He failed in <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>"One thing in your cu&s;toms &s;hocks me," &s;ays Rou&s;&s;eau to the Poles, <Q>and appears to me quite oppo&s;ite to the genius of your Con&s;titution: it is, to &s;ee it &s;o far &s;u&s;pended, and almo&s;t annihilated, on the death of the King, as that all the tribunals are &s;hut up on that occa&s;ion; as if the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice depended &s;o much on the life of the King, as that the death of the one mu&s;t be the de&s;truction of the other. <HI>It ought to be exactly the rever&s;e: on the death of the King every thing &s;hould go on as if he were alive; one ought hardly to perceive that a part of the machine is wanting, con&s;idering how little e&s;&s;ential that piece is to its &s;olidity.</HI></Q> Gouvernement de Pologne, Chap. xvi.</P>
<P>How many ab&s;urdities are contained in the&s;e few lines! <HI>Royalty,</HI> in Rou&s;&s;eau's opinion, is <HI>little e&s;&s;ential,</HI> even to a large political <HI>machine!</HI> Was it his intention, in advi&s;ing the Poles to retain it in their government, to teach them how to do with|out it, or to con&s;ider it as dangerous?</P>
<P>In pointing out this &s;trange mi&s;take of Rou&s;&s;eau, in his work on Poland, it would be great inju&s;tice not to acknowledge the high merit of almo&s;t all the re&s;t of that work. I con&s;ider it, if I may be allowed the expre&s;&s;ion, as the be&s;t antidote to his Social Contract. In the latter, Rou&s;&s;eau was wandering in an ideal world; but afterwards his political judgment was matured, and his informa|tion on the &s;ubject became much more exten&s;ive. Ob&s;erve how cau|tiou&s;ly, in his former work, he pa&s;&s;es by all his ab&s;tract principles, or at lea&s;t with what uncommon prudence he modifies them, &s;o as to adapt them to the circum&s;tances of the Poles. Pre&s;erve every thing, he &s;ays to them, overturn nothing; correct at fir&s;t only that which e&s;&s;entially wants correction, and that which will enable you gradually to improve the re&s;t. Let the French meditate on that excellent work, and then a&s;k them&s;elves what would have been the author's advice to them, if he had been called upon to give to their nation, as well as to the Poles, in|&s;tructions for a new Con&s;titution.</P>
<P>If this political writer, who&s;e eloquence has given him &s;uch an influence over the opinions of the age, had but lived long enough in England to ob&s;erve the practical effects of her Con|&s;titution, how much might it have contributed to introduce true liberty on the Continent?</P></NOTE>

the attempt, and the independence of his country did not out-live his captivity. The Poli&s;h nation is extinct; but the la&s;t page of her annals is the mo&s;t honourable; for no people ever &s;hewed them|&s;elves more worthy of independence than they did at the very moment when they lo&s;t it; and from the &s;truggle they made to pre&s;erve it, po&s;terity may infer the u&s;e they would have made of it.</Q></P>
<P><Q>In this glorious effort the Poles had but one avowed ally; and, will it be credited? that ally was France! France, who was at that time em|ployed in de&s;troying her own hereditary and pro|&s;perous monarchy, and endeavouring to e&s;tabli&s;h on its ruins the competition of equals, and to kindle the very pa&s;&s;ions which Poland was endeavouring to extingui&s;h! The latter wi&s;hed to pre&s;erve no|bility, and to make the monarchy hereditary; the former overturned an hereditary throne, and de|&s;troyed the nobility which &s;upported it. The Poles were anxious for a limited government, re|&s;embling the Briti&s;h Con&s;titution; the French

never &s;poke of that Con&s;titution but with the di&s;|dain which u&s;ually accompanies ignorance, and rejected every attempt to introduce it.</Q></P>
<P>This &s;triking contra&s;t the French either will not, or cannot ob&s;erve. But, in&s;tead of advi&s;ing them to imitate America, the friends of &s;ocial order would do better to direct their attention to the annals of Poland; and endeavour to convince them that liberty does not depend on making the laws and the rulers of a nation &s;ubject to the people, but in making the people and their rulers &s;ubject to law; and that, in a great nation, a limited monarchy is the only way to unite liberty with authority; for a vacancy of the fir&s;t place in any government is a &s;ource of inevitable competition, di&s;cord, and civil war.</P>
<P>After having refuted the opinion of Rou&s;&s;eau in favour of elective monarchies, I ought not to omit, that attached as he was to a republican government, yet it would have been the la&s;t of &s;y&s;tems which he would have recommended to the French; knowing, as he did, the capricious levity of their character; and always a&s;&s;erting, as he did, that republican liberty cannot be maintained but by au&s;tere manners, and the mo&s;t rigid virtue.</P>
<P>How much it is to be regretted that he could not fore&s;ee that the French would be the fir&s;t to adopt his principles! that they would be the fir&s;t to put them&s;elves under the <HI>heavy yoke</HI> of a Republican Government! and that, with a view to reali&s;e his fan|ciful theories, they would, with their u&s;ual incon&s;ide|rate levity, take upon them a burden under the weight of which they have &s;unk!

that country. It is, that the nation, weary of the pre&s;ent Convention, indignant at its &s;candalous con|duct, and &s;hocked at the mi&s;ery which it has brought and &s;till brings upon their country, will oblige it to di&s;&s;olve it&s;elf, to make room for tho&s;e Members of the Con&s;tituent A&s;&s;embly who &s;till &s;urvive; &s;ub&s;tituting men who were only guilty of errors, in&s;tead of men who&s;e whole conduct has been full of crimes.

No doubt their very fir&s;t act would be to &s;et a&s;ide their own ab&s;urd Con&s;titution of 1791, too republican for a Monarchy, too monarchical for a Republic. No doubt they would think that the mo&s;t effectual mode of &s;ecuring liberty, is by en&s;uring obedience to legal authority. They commenced their political career with a declaration that France re|nounced all wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s for the purpo&s;e of conque&s;t: if again in power, it may be expected that their fir&s;t mea&s;ure would be to re&s;tore the conque&s;ts made during their pro&s;cription; their &s;incerity would not be doubted, and a peace with France would then be equally ea&s;y and &s;ecure.

<HEAD>CHAPTER V.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>Of &s;ome Prejudices of the French re&s;pecting the Briti&s;h Con&s;titution.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>AMONG the great number of well-informed men in France, before the pre&s;ent Revolution, nothing was more uncommon than to find any who had tolerably correct ideas of the Briti&s;h Con&s;titution; and it mu&s;t be owned that in general the Engli&s;h who travelled there took no great pains to inform them on the &s;ub|ject. Whether it is that the Engli&s;h are too much inclined to believe that few foreigners can compre|hend the principles of &s;o complicated &s;y&s;tem; or that, with a view to complete the contra&s;t between the character of the two nations, the Engli&s;h &s;tudiou&s;ly affect to be indifferent to the opinion of foreigners; or that, from a principle of humanity, they are unwil|ling, when abroad, to remind other nations of their want of liberty; and on that account are afraid of ex|pre&s;&s;ing too &s;trongly the conviction which is inter|woven in every thought, and manife&s;ted in every action of an Engli&s;hman, <HI>that he, and he only, is free.</HI></P>
<P>Till Mr. De Lolme publi&s;hed his work, tho&s;e of the French who had any opinion at all on the &s;ubject, were almo&s;t all extravagant in prai&s;ing the Briti&s;h Con|&s;titution, or equally extravagant in condemning it.</P>
<P>The former con&s;idered it as a &s;y&s;tem truly divine, unconnected with any human pa&s;&s;ions, the perfection of political virtue; while, on the contrary, it goes &s;o
<PB N="97" REF="048483_0098_102535FE797ACC48">
entirely upon a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of human imperfection, that it may very properly be called a complete &s;y&s;tem of <HI>human correction.</HI> It does not proceed upon the impo&s;&s;ible &s;peculation of eradicating the pa&s;&s;ions, or governing without them; but its arrangements are adapted to limit their career, to direct them to the bene|fit of &s;ocial life, and even to govern by their a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>Next came the cen&s;urers, who formed their judg|ments, partly from writers as ignorant as them&s;elves; and partly from the parliamentary debates, in which they under&s;tood every hyperbolical, metaphorical, or declamatory expre&s;&s;ion, in a literal &s;en&s;e.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t they gravely told you <HI>that the King is always carrying on a &s;ecret war again&s;t the Con&s;titution;</HI> which has very little other meaning than that the Con&s;titu|tion has provided effectually again&s;t open ho&s;tilities.</P>
<P>Next they told you <HI>that the Hou&s;e of Peers is evi|dently a &s;ort of advanced po&s;t to the Crown, where the Nobles act the part of &s;entinels ana &s;pies;&mdash;that the Peerage is evidently a &s;atellite of the Crown, and only &s;erves to &s;trengthen it again&s;t the nation.</HI> Now, no one di&s;putes but that the Peers are intended to guard the Crown, and that their &s;ituation does make them a &s;ort of advanced po&s;t for its protection; but that po&s;t is defen&s;ive only: they have no privileges which give them the &s;malle&s;t power of attacking the con&s;titu|tional rights of the Commons; and their political in|fluence, as a body, depends as much on preventing the de&s;poti&s;m, as on maintaining the prerogatives of the Crown.</P>
<P><HI>No matter,</HI> &s;ay the French of the pre&s;ent day; <HI>an hereditary Nobility is nothing but a great impo&s;ition upon &s;ociety; it is an infringement of tho&s;e equal rights which all men derive from nature.</HI> But admitting it is &s;o, does it not prevent many other greater, and more dange|rous infringements? Are not eminent talents an in|fringement made by nature her&s;elf, of that perfect equality of right which is the foundation-&s;tone in the

Can we conceive a &s;ociety which can prevent the Ari&s;tocracy of riches? and does not this latter even increa&s;e in proportion as a State is well governed? Is it le&s;s greedy, or more enlightened, than an hereditary Nobility? Is not this latter &s;pecies of Ari&s;tocracy the be&s;t, indeed the only counterpoi&s;e, in a great State, to the former? Is the arrogance of up&s;tarts le&s;s grating to the people, from among whom they came, or is their familiar in&s;olence le&s;s in&s;ulting, than the haughty di&s;tance of an here|ditary Nobility?</P>
<P>Certainly there is in the Briti&s;h Con&s;titution, a No|bility, or rather an hereditary Peerage; I will add too, that the &s;ingle privilege which it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, is by its nature much &s;uperior to the whole multitude of petty privileges belonging to the nobles of all other countries in Europe: and let the French mention, if they can, any of the privileges of the Briti&s;h Peerage which are burden&s;ome to the people, or in any way in|jurious to it.</P>
<P>The French are much mi&s;taken, if they think that in this country wealth is enough to procure nobility; or that, if wealth could purcha&s;e it, it would give that exemption from taxes which is the ordinary con&s;e|quence of it in mo&s;t other countries. The Briti&s;h Peerage can hardly be &s;aid to po&s;&s;e&s;s more than one exclu&s;ive privilege,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>As members of one of the Hou&s;es of Parliament, Peers are exempt from arre&s;t for debt; but their property may be &s;eized for the u&s;e of their creditors, without any di&s;tinction even of the Princes of the Blood.</P>
<P>And though the Peers have the privilege of being tried by their own body for criminal offences, yet their puni&s;hment, if convicted, is the &s;ame as that of a commoner. Henry V. while Prince of Wales, was impri&s;oned by order of a Judge, of the name of Ga&s;|coyne, for having a&s;&s;aulted him on the Bench. Should any foreigner con&s;ider this example as of too remote a date, they may be referred to another. While this publication was writing, an Engli&s;h Peer was under impri&s;onment by &s;entence of the Court of King's-Bench, for having publi&s;hed a libel on an Attorney, in a news-paper.</P></NOTE> which no doubt is a very great

one, and that is, the hereditary right of &s;ucceeding to a &s;eat in the Hou&s;e of Lords. I acknowledge that this is a privilege of great importance: but before it is cen&s;ured as improper, it may be worth con&s;idering whether that hereditary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion has not a &s;trong tendency to defend the fundamental principles of the Con&s;titution, as well as to pre&s;erve certain great maxims of State, which might el&s;e be in danger, in ca&s;e of the coincidence of a general election, with any violent popular agitation. No one can be ignorant of the effect which popular agitation mu&s;t always have, in a greater or le&s;s degree, on an a&s;&s;embly elected by the people. The mo&s;t zealous friend even of Democracy will not deny, that it often prevents &s;ound judgment, and that any check upon its innovating &s;pirit is wi&s;e, and &s;hould be adopted.</P>
<P>It &s;hould be recollected that the Briti&s;h Peers are by no means numerous<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The Hou&s;e of Lords con&s;i&s;ts at pre&s;ent of 274 members, inclu|ding the Bi&s;hops and the &s;ixteen Scotch Peers. The French Nobility was certainly blind to its own intere&s;ts, in not endeavour|ing to &s;creen it&s;elf from the &s;torm, before it was too late, by intro|ducing into France, in&s;tead of their u&s;ele&s;s privileges, a repre&s;en|tation of their body in a hou&s;e analogous to the Briti&s;h Hou&s;e of Lords; either partly hereditary and partly elective, or el&s;e entirely elective.</P>
<P>On this Note the Tran&s;lator wi&s;hes to remark, that he doubts whether an elective repre&s;entation of any particular cla&s;s in a State, e&s;pecially if periodical, has not a tendency to create a di&s;tinct in|tere&s;t by no means con&s;i&s;tent with the common good. In the pre&s;ent in&s;tance, an hereditary Upper Hou&s;e, formed by a &s;election from the French Nobility, would certainly be more favourable to the a&s;cendancy of a Lower Hou&s;e, repre&s;enting the People, than a periodically-elective repre&s;entation of the Nobility, and perhaps than any other &s;pecies of Senate which can be invented. A peri|odical or occa&s;ional election of repre&s;entatives of the Ari&s;tocracy of a country, under whatever name or form, gives it one common in|tere&s;t, and a di&s;po&s;ition to act in concert for &s;upporting it: whereas the Briti&s;h Con&s;titution divides the Ari&s;tocratic influence, by having a &s;mall political Ari&s;tocracy di&s;tinct from, and not de|pendent upon, that general Ari&s;tocracy, which is founded in an|cient family, and exten&s;ive landed property; which, in a tranquil &s;tate of &s;ociety, no po&s;&s;ible arrangements can long prevent; and which no political folly can be greater than the adoption of any regulations for preventing.</P>
<P>The Nobles of the pre&s;ent generation in France, who are really men of ancient families and exten&s;ive po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and who mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have been excluded from all immediate chance of the Peerage, might, from prejudice of habit, feel them&s;elves degraded; but their po&s;terity would feel the advantage of the full influence of a &s;uperiority derived from tho&s;e circum&s;tances, unimpaired by any artificial di&s;tinctions, or any privileges tending to excite the jealou&s;y of the people, and keep the two parties in a &s;tate of perpetual political warfare. But whatever might be decided as to the mode of forming an Upper Hou&s;e, the members of it &s;hould on no account, if elective, be all at once renewed, or be elected for a &s;hort period.</P></NOTE> enough to eclip&s;e the people; that,

as the bulk of the e&s;tate u&s;ually goes with the title, their fortune gives them the means of a good education; and that, as their privilege is limited to judicial and political functions, it is only by a good education, and by the knowledge and the decorum of character, requi|&s;ite in tho&s;e functions, that they can hope to derive any material advantage from their privilege. Education and practice create ability; and one may judge from this circum&s;tance only, that, as a body, the Briti&s;h Nobility can never pre&s;ent, what is but too often &s;een in other countries, ignorance, pride, and poverty united. The &s;ame circum&s;tance too gives them the ability to manage their private affairs better than the Nobility of other countries; and obliges them to be more attentive to character, becau&s;e their con&s;equence depends &s;o much on public opinion.</P>
<P>Nor is this all: for the younger branches of their families, by being blended with the general ma&s;s, form a durable connexion between the Commons to whom they belong, and the Peers from whom they are &s;prung.</P>
<P><PB N="101" REF="048483_0102_1025366779B77788">This is the kind of Nobility which the Con&s;tituent A&s;&s;embly &s;hould have endeavoured to &s;ub&s;titute, when, in their fir&s;t delirium, they agitated the fatal decree which &s;uppre&s;&s;ed the rank of Nobility in France; a decree which, in its con&s;equences, occa|&s;ioned the de&s;truction of tho&s;e who had the misfor|tune to be of that order: for it led to the erection of all tho&s;e bloody tribunals which &s;ent them to the &s;caffold.</P>
<P>But, at that important cri&s;is, nothing would have more effectually quieted the fears and di&s;&s;ipated the jealou&s;y of the <HI>Tiers Etat,</HI> than telling them, that though there is an order of Nobility e&s;tabli&s;hed in England, yet in point of taxation, or in any other re&s;pect, there is no difference between them and the Commons; that the word <HI>Commoner</HI> has no deba&s;ing &s;en&s;e attached to it, nor is a noble family con&s;i|dered as di&s;graced by an alliance with one of that cla&s;s:<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The original is, "there are no words in the language of that nation for <HI>roture</HI> and <HI>m&eacute;&s;alliance.</HI>"&mdash;The ob&s;ervation is perfectly ju&s;t, and accounts for the paraphra&s;e to which the Tran&s;lator has been obliged to re&s;ort, in order to expre&s;s the author's meaning.</NOTE> that &s;eats in the Hou&s;e of Peers are often the reward of di&s;tingui&s;hed talents; and that tho&s;e who are &s;o introduced into it, are not treated as up|&s;tarts and intruders, but with the re&s;pect due to their merit; and that, at the very time wher the National A&s;&s;embly was declaiming again&s;t the haughty Hou&s;e of Peers, the two individuals of that body who were next, in point of rank, to the Royal Family, were both born of parents not above the middle cla&s;s of life.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">One of them, the late Lord Chancellor, when according to the rules of the Hou&s;e of Peers he delivered in his pedigree, only mentioned in it the names of his father and mother.

is more valuable, and therefore more de&s;irable than in any other country, is yet the only one where there are a number of ancient and opulent families who have little or no inclination to be rai&s;ed to that rank. Such is the effect of a Con&s;titution which makes every rank re&s;pectable, and which can be&s;tow its honours without humbling tho&s;e who do not partake of them!</P>
<P>But, in fact, tho&s;e who declaim, in France, again&s;t the Briti&s;h Con&s;titution, inveigh chiefly again&s;t the Hou&s;e of Commons. <Q>That Hou&s;e," &s;ay they, holds the &s;trings of the pur&s;e; and if it is clamorous at any time, it is only with the hope of having its mouth &s;topped with gold. Thanks to the civil li&s;t, which it occa&s;ionally takes care to increa&s;e, the Mini&s;ters have always the means of bribing its members, and making them vote ju&s;t as they plea&s;e. If they do not give them money, they give them places; and when they have made their bargains, they can, with impunity, &s;et public opinion at defiance.</Q></P>
<P>Some truth perhaps there is in this, mingled with a great deal of error; and a few explanations are ne|ce&s;&s;ary, to di&s;tingui&s;h the one from the other.</P>
<P>Without doubt, there exi&s;ts a mini&s;terial influence; and partly by conferring places, partly by promi&s;ing them, that influence is very exten&s;ive. But before it is blamed, three points &s;hould be con&s;idered: 1&s;t, Whether a majority of the members are under that influence? 2dly, Whether that influence, to the extent under which it exi&s;ts, is more pernicious than u&s;eful? 3dly, Whether it can be exerted in ca&s;es which affect the liberty of the nation?</P>
<P>With a view to a &s;olution of the&s;e que&s;tions, I &s;hall con&s;ider the Hou&s;e of Commons as divided into three cla&s;&s;es. The fir&s;t is compo&s;ed of tho&s;e who &s;upport the Mini&s;ter, either from con&s;iderations of per&s;onal attachment, or as holding places under Government, or as looking forwards to them. The &s;econd cla&s;s
<PB N="103" REF="048483_0104_1025368982793978">
includes the Oppo&s;ition, and con&s;i&s;ts of tho&s;e who wi&s;h to &s;upplant the Mini&s;try, and of their intimate connexions, who would follow them into power, and participate in their admini&s;tration. The third con|&s;i&s;ts of tho&s;e who are not de&s;irous of taking an active part in government, who&s;e ambition is to &s;hew the pride of independence, and to watch over the intere&s;ts of the nation, without caring much which party is at the helm.&mdash;This cla&s;s is u&s;ually more numerous than the Oppo&s;ition, but perhaps le&s;s &s;o than the immediate friends of Admini&s;tration; and is a kind of neutral power, joining &s;ometim<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">s the one, &s;ometimes the other party, as it thinks mo&s;t for the public good, and is &s;ure to carry victory with it.

<P>This is what deceives foreigners, when they think that the majority is entirely compo&s;ed of the mini&s;te|rial party; though in fact the object of a very large proportion of that <HI>majority</HI> is, not to &s;upport the Mini|&s;ter, but only the Government. The members who con&s;ider them&s;elves as independent of both parties, no doubt, cannot be exempt from the partialities of human nature; and may, from various circum&s;tances, have a preference for men or for mea&s;ures, which may incline them more to one party than to the other; but their object is to act without being under the influence of either.</P>
<P>Whether Mr. Pitt or Mr. Fox be at the head of affairs, is not with them the mo&s;t material point; but
<PB N="104" REF="048483_0105_102536969090B900">
that the intere&s;ts of the nation do not &s;uffer, and that the rights of their con&s;tituents are not infringed&mdash;This cla&s;s is particularly attentive to the public opinion; and though it checks the current of it when proceeding too much from popular agitation, yet it always adopts it, when clear and decided; and always &s;ucceeds in obliging the Mini&s;ter, either to change his mea&s;ures, or to quit his place, if he ob&s;tinately per&s;everes in them.</P>
<P>A majority mu&s;t not be condemned in the ma&s;s as corrupt, unle&s;s that majority &s;upports the Mini&s;ter on important que&s;tions, with the &s;ame implicit confidence as in the common bu&s;ine&s;s of government: but that is by no means the ca&s;e: for, not to go any farther back than the pre&s;ent admini&s;tration of Mr. Pitt, if foreign|ers think that his name, his place, and his abilities, are magnets which draw to him on every occa&s;ion an invincible majority, it is perhaps becau&s;e they have not ob&s;erved that even Mr. Pitt, whom they con&s;ider as &s;o all-powerful, has &s;everal times been in a minority; and that &s;everal times, on having propo&s;ed mea&s;ures which he con&s;idered as important, but to which the public opinion was ho&s;tile, the very members who &s;o generally &s;upport him, have &s;trongly oppo&s;ed him, and obliged him to withdraw them.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Thus, the Mini&s;ters, in 1791, &s;topped their preparations for war again&s;t Ru&s;&s;ia; and Mr. Pitt him&s;elf propo&s;ed the repeal of the &s;hop-tax, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</P>
<P>If again&s;t this it is alledged, that the American war was pro|longed in oppo&s;ition to the general wi&s;h of the nation; I an&s;wer, that the American war was at fir&s;t extremely popular, and &s;till more &s;o when France took part in it; but as &s;oon as it was become decidedly unpopular, the majority of the Hou&s;e of Commons op|po&s;ed Lord North, and obliged him to re&s;ign; &s;o that the ex|ample confirms the a&s;&s;ertion, in&s;tead of contradicting it. The peace which terminated that war, confirms it in a &s;till more &s;triking manner. It is now generally acknowledged that Lord Shelburne, who negociated that peace, did his country a mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential &s;ervice by it; yet, at the time when it was concluded, it occa&s;ioned a great deal of di&s;content; the re&s;ult was, that the Hou&s;e of Commons again &s;acrificed the Mini&s;try to the public opinion.</P></NOTE></P>

<P>Another complaint is, that this Hou&s;e repre&s;ents the people unequally. This is not denied;<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>It is much more ea&s;y to di&s;cover an imperfection, than to apply a remedy. An imperfection in theory, no doubt it is; but it may be que&s;tioned whether it is &s;o in practice.

<P>I certainly agree with Mr. Adams, that the repre&s;entation of the people in the Hou&s;e of Commons is not agreeable to the u&s;ually-received theory of repre&s;entation; but I go no farther with him. For a little ob&s;ervation will &s;hew that this abu&s;e in theory receives a great many u&s;eful modifications in practice; and one is a&s;toni&s;hed to di&s;cover in it intere&s;ts counterbalancing one another, which writers upon the &s;ubject have neglected to mention. For in&s;tance, I am much inclined to believe, that if the la&s;t project of parliamentary reform which came before the Hou&s;e of Com|mons had been adopted, an ab&s;olute preponderance in that Hou&s;e would have been given to the ancient and opulent families. That perhaps might have do<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters"> no harm; but yet, it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that the rotten borough<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">, as they are called, give an op|portunity to many men of merit, with moderate fortunes, and little popular intere&s;t, of coming into Parliament, who would otherwi&s;e hardly find admi&s;&s;ion there.

<P>Though the Author declines entering into the que&s;tion, the Tran&s;lator, as an Engli&s;hman, may be allowed to introduce a few remarks on &s;o e&s;&s;ential a part of the government of his country as the Con&s;titution of the Hou&s;e of Commons. It &s;trikes him that perhaps that even the theories of repre&s;entation, which are u&s;ually adopted, are not free from imperfection in con&s;equence of more attention being given to the form than to the utility of the in&s;titution. If in any in&s;tance utility is the chief object, then the con&s;ideration of the mo&s;t effectual means of promoting that utility &s;hould be principally attended to; and if tho&s;e means are not morally wrong, they mu&s;t be politically right. What then, I think, might theoretically be wi&s;hed for, in an A&s;&s;embly repre&s;enting the people, is, 1&s;t, That the per&s;ons compo&s;ing it &s;hould be influenced by public opinion, on all &s;ubjects, where the circum&s;tances are &s;o much within the &s;cope of general ob&s;ervation that the judgment of the public can be found and deci&s;ive; 2dly, That they &s;hould not be under the controul of popular agitations; 3dly, That no particular de&s;cription or cla&s;s of the people &s;hould have a dangerou&s;ly-preponderating influence over them.</P>
<P>In theory then, the con&s;truction of a national repre&s;entative body &s;hould be &s;uch, that amid the rivalries of different occupations, and of different ranks, no one &s;hould have a preponderance over <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e others. If either population, landed property, commerce, or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">anufactures, have &s;uch a preponderance, the deci&s;ions of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">ected body mu&s;t be proportionably partial; and without com|menting on the inju&s;tice, it is enough to con&s;ider the impolicy of &s;uch a &s;y&s;tem.&mdash;If again an attempt is made, as in &s;ome &s;mall Republics it has been made, to give to each de&s;cription of per&s;ons a right of electing a fixed proportion of the whole elected body; this mo&s;t evidently con&s;titutes it, in a way which forms a demar|cation of the different intere&s;ts, and by which the repre&s;entatives become rather the agents and committees of their re&s;pective con|&s;tituents, than men acting with one common motive, to one common end&mdash;the public good.</P>
<P>Without entering into a detailed application of the&s;e ob&s;erva|tions to the Briti&s;h Hou&s;e of Commons, I will only ob&s;erve, that the very different con&s;truction of the electoral bodies, and the pre|ponderance of different ranks and occupations in different electoral bodies, actually give a repre&s;entation of each, and in a cer|tain degree a repre&s;entation by each; while, at the &s;ame time, this is done without at all marking out the different de&s;criptions of people, as by a cen&s;us; without proclaiming ho&s;tilities between them; and with &s;uch &s;hades of difference as prevent the prepon|derance of any one de&s;cription, to the injury of the re&s;t. Such practically is the Briti&s;h Hou&s;e of Commons: how far the propor|tionate influence of each cla&s;s is &s;uch as be&s;t contributes to the common good, the experience of its conduct will determine better than any ab&s;tract &s;peculation; and that will mo&s;t evidently prove, 1&s;t, That the per&s;ons compo&s;ing it are influenced by public opi|nion on all &s;ubj<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">cts where the circum&s;tances are &s;o much within the &s;cope of general ob&s;ervation that the judgment of the public can be found and deci&s;ive; 2dly, That they are <HI>not</HI> under the controul of popular agitations; and, 3dly, That no particular de|&s;cription or cla&s;s of the people has a dangerou&s;ly preponderating influence there.</P>
<P>From effects which are beneficial, we &s;hould look back to their cau&s;es; and in&s;tead of &s;ub&s;tituting new cau&s;es, with a view to greater perfection, we &s;hould con&s;ider by what means any cau&s;es already productive of u&s;eful effects may be made more exten&s;ively u&s;eful.

But, with|out confining my&s;elf to Great Britain, if I extend my views to the conduct of its government with re&s;pect to conquered nations, its liberality towards Canada and Cor&s;ica is &s;ufficiently known; and with regard to India, it is ab&s;olutely unknown upon the continent, that, under the admini&s;tration of Lord Cornwallis, not only the in|terior cu&s;tom-hou&s;es which had exi&s;ted from time immemorial in Bengal, to the great oppre&s;&s;<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">n of trade, were totally aboli&s;hed; but the permanent right of territorial property, never before known in that country, was fir&s;t granted to the native landholders (who un|der the Mogul government only po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed their e&s;tates by a yearly &s;ettlement).

<P>The&s;e re&s;trictions and limitations have been &s;o far from weakening the &s;trength of Government, that they have tended very con&s;iderably to increa&s;e it, by increa&s;ing the confidence of the public, which is too well a&s;&s;ured of its freedom, and too con&s;cious of its &s;trength, to be terrified or impo&s;ed upon by tho&s;e who

<P>Whence come &s;o many important ameliorations, and within &s;o &s;hort a &s;pace of time, but from a prin|ciple in the Con&s;titution which renders it capable of &s;elf-improvement, as well as &s;elf-protection?

<P>This chain of happy alterations &s;ufficiently proves, in my opinion, that the con&s;truction of the Briti&s;h Parliament di&s;po&s;es it, of its own will, to adopt mea|&s;ures of improvement depending on times and cir|cum&s;tances; for it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved, that none of the&s;e mea&s;ures were forced upon it by any popular commotions, and all of them were well con&s;idered and deliberately adopted.</P>

A Convention, and e&s;pecially a French Convention, would think it a point of honour not to part with|out doing &s;omething; and innovations would be made, merely to avoid the di&s;grace of not having in|novated. Not one of the&s;e inconveniences attends the Briti&s;h Parliament, which enjoys the plenitude of legi&s;lative power. None conte&s;t its authority; it has no di&s;tinct political body behind it, to &s;u&s;pend, or modify, or rever&s;e its decrees; and it is always able to change the exi&s;ting laws, or adapt them to cir|cum&s;tances.</P>
<P>It is really a&s;toni&s;hing that experience has not yet corrected this erroneous opinion of the French on the nature of Conventions. By the new plan which Cambaceres lately pre&s;ented, it may be ob&s;erved that they &s;till retain the ab&s;urd notion of limiting the powers of the legi&s;lative body, and of not permitting it to touch any of the con&s;titutional laws.

<P>What I have &s;aid re&s;pecting the Briti&s;h Con&s;titution, as it appears in practice, I am &s;en&s;ible, is but an imperfect &s;ketch; for the &s;ubject, even if I were capable of treat|ing it more accurately, is much too exten&s;ive, as well as too profound, for the limits of a pamphlet, written in ha&s;te, and on the &s;pur of the occa&s;ion. My only object, in this Chapter, has been to turn the attention of the French to the ab&s;urdity of that declamatory abu&s;e of the Briti&s;h Con&s;titution, which, for five years pa&s;t, has been employed to prejudice them again&s;t it, and induce them to think it as vicious in practice, as it is perfect in theory. All I de&s;ire is, to be able to correct &s;ome of the prevailing errors among them on this &s;ubject, and to induce them to believe it worth a fuller examination, and to read the publications which develope the elements of it. The mo&s;t complete work on this &s;ubject is certainly that of Mr. De Lolme; none more clearly explains its principles, or is more explicit, on the manner in which its different branches are a check upon one another, and on the &s;ecurity it gives to per&s;onal liberty.</P>

<P>Perhaps the mo&s;t unfortunate &s;tep of the Con&s;ti|tuent A&s;&s;embly, is one for which it has been very little cen&s;ured; I mean, its having voted the Mo|narchy, exactly as the Convention has &s;ince voted the Republic,&mdash;by acclamation.

<HEAD>CONCLUSION.</HEAD>
<P>PEACE is the univer&s;al and earne&s;t prayer of all the Powers at war with France. Why will not the French then at la&s;t &s;ee the aby&s;s into which the ob|&s;tinacy of the pre&s;ent Convention is precipitating them? Can it be po&s;&s;ible that they &s;till deceive them|&s;elves? Do they &s;till imagine that a government can be renovated amid the din of arms, and the dangers of war? or that famine at home can be pre|vented, by employing the &s;trength of their country in maintaining a precarious po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of de&s;olated con|que&s;ts?</P>
<P>What can they hope to gain by prolonging this bloody conte&s;t? Is it glory? They have already borne down all oppo&s;ition. Do they wi&s;h for more conque&s;ts? Tho&s;e they have already made have in|jured them more than a diminution of territory would have done. What then prevents them? Fal&s;e &s;hame. They will not &s;ubmit to the humiliation of re&s;titution. But which is lea&s;t humiliating&mdash;a retreat from choice, or a retreat from evident nece&s;&s;ity? What humilia|tion can there be in re&s;toring what they have taken, to enemies whom they have vanqui&s;hed? And as to Great-Britain, can they doubt a moment but that &s;uch an unequivocal proof of their pacific di&s;po&s;ition would produce a &s;imilar di&s;po&s;ition in her? Do they fear that the Princes at war with them will take advantage of &s;uch re&s;titutions, to renew the conte&s;t on the fron|tier?

<P><HI>Brave Seamen! War, war with the Engli&s;h! It is they who &s;eek to divide you, and to corrupt you. It is they who, afraid to encounter you at &s;ea, have endeavoured to detain you in port.</HI> WAR, WAR, <HI>with the Engli&s;h!</HI></P>
<P>It is worth ob&s;erving, that nearly at the time when the Conven|tion was thus proclaiming war again&s;t the Engli&s;h, the two Hou&s;es of Parliament were debating whether it would not be proper to make further advances towards a reconciliation.</P></NOTE> It is, I acknowledge, ab&s;olutely

nece&s;&s;ary to the ambition of tho&s;e who lead the Con|vention, and to the exi&s;tence of the Republic they have made; for they &s;till retain the &s;pirit, though they dare not, as a body, <HI>avow</HI> the language of their incendiary decree of the 19th of November, 1792.<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>This decree, it is well known, was the work of the Giron|di&s;t party, which is now again triumphant, and which acting upon it in its fulle&s;t extent, in the affair with Geneva, refu&s;ed to ratify a treaty, by declaring, <HI>that the only one admi&s;&s;ible was a communication of principles.</HI> Though the authors of that decree have &s;uffered it to &s;leep, yet, every now and then, they di&s;cover their intention of bringing it into action again whenever it &s;uits their convenience. Of this, I think, the following ludicrous tran&s;actions in the Convention, on the 26th and 27th of April, are clear evidence.</P>
<P>On the 26th, Gregoire concluded a pompous harangue, by propo&s;ing <HI>a declaration of the Rights of Nations,</HI> much in the &s;ame &s;tyle as that <HI>of the Rights of Man.</HI></P>
<P>The 4th Article declares, <HI>that nations, when at war, &s;hould do one another as little mi&s;chief as po&s;&s;ible;</HI> and this extremely philan|thropic article was applauded by the very &s;ame men who have been barbarians enough to &s;end a &s;quadron to de&s;troy the humane e&s;tabli&s;hment of Sierra Leone; the object of which was a gene+rous attempt to prevent, what they talk &s;o much of preventing&mdash; Slavery.</P>
<P>The 14th Article declares, that <HI>treaties which have for their object an offen&s;ive war, are high trea&s;on again&s;t the family of man|kind.</HI> And this too, the Convention applauded, though they well knew that at that very time their Deputies were con|tracting an <HI>offen&s;ive</HI> as well as defen&s;ive alliance with the United Provinces.</P>
<P>The 7th Article declares, <HI>that a nation has no right to inter|fere in the government of other nations.</HI> What is meant by <HI>govern|ment,</HI> the next article explains; which expre&s;sly declares, THAT NO GOVERNMENTS ARE CONFORMABLE TO THE RIGHTS OF NATIONS, BUT ONLY SUCH AS ARE FOUNDED ON LIBERTY AND EQUALITY.</P>
<P>The next day, however, Merlin of Douay mounted the tri|bune in great ha&s;te, and announced in the name of the <HI>Com|mittee of Public Safety,</HI> <Q>That all Europe having heard their declaration, never to examine, much le&s;s never to cen&s;ure, the fundamental principles, or the organization of foreign governments; it is material to the Republic, and po&s;&s;ibly to the &s;afety of all Europe, to repeal the decree of the preceding evening, that ordered the printing of a &s;peech, and of a declaration of the rights of nations which had been read in that A&s;&s;embly. The Committee, &s;aid he, has ob&s;erved in both, <HI>principles which you cannot</HI> AVOW. I need not mention what might be the con&s;equences of &s;uch opinions &s;pread through Europe <HI>in the pre&s;ent moment.</HI></Q></P>
<P><HI>"As it is imagined that my &s;peech contains &s;omething improper,"</HI> &s;aid Gregoire, <Q>I &s;econd the motion; but I ought to mention, that perhaps, by this time, it has appeared in &s;ome of the papers;</Q>

<P>Every &s;itting of the Convention, every debate proves that the Republic is already falling to pieces, and that its ruin is inevitable.

<P>What then are we to think of the caution with which the Author of <HI>Reflections on Peace</HI> has avoided &s;aying a word on the finances of France?

Great as the talents of both are, the kingdom is not quite &s;o de&s;titute of men of ability, judgment, and integrity, as that it mu&s;t cea&s;e to be a nation if it lo&s;es them both.

The inhabitants of the&s;e i&s;lands are not children in the &s;chool of politics; &s;ound judgment, formed by long practice of political di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, has convinced them, that Britain mu&s;t, at any ri&s;k, prevent the aggrandi&s;e|ment of France, and leave nothing undone to pre&s;erve the balance of power in Europe.</P>
<P>Self-evident as the&s;e propo&s;itions are, we now hear them called with contempt, the <HI>old-fa&s;hioned maxims of an antiquated &s;y&s;tem;</HI> and the Briti&s;h Parliament has of cour&s;e, either from corruption or ignorance, been blind for more than a century. Can it then have no other rea&s;ons for &s;upporting Mr. Pitt, but a &s;cramble for places?

the&s;e pernicious prejudices again&s;t him, which are the real cau&s;es of the continuation of the war with England? Why not &s;hew them the free Con&s;titution which Cor&s;ica has adopted, &s;ince her emancipation from France; and which is &s;urely a &s;ufficient proof that no idea is enter|tained in this country, of compelling other nations to adopt the letter of her own Con&s;titution, or of en|&s;laving any people who wi&s;h to be free? But what is at pre&s;ent carefully concealed from the French, and which, notwith&s;tanding it is of the utmo&s;t importance they &s;hould know, is, that the pre&s;ent war neither is, nor ever has been, on the part of this country, a war of ambition, or envy, but of mere &s;elf-defence: there is not a man in it, with any preten&s;ions to good &s;en&s;e, who has joined in the war on any other ground than a conviction of its nece&s;&s;ity; who does not &s;incerely regret that there is &s;till the &s;ame nece&s;&s;ity of continuing it; who does not think it the be&s;t policy this country can adopt, to make, if po&s;&s;ible, a la&s;ting peace with France; and does not &s;incerely wi&s;h that the latter &s;hould be happy and tranquil, neither di&s;turbed by her neighbours, nor extending her frontiers at their expence.</P>
<P>I know well that the Committees of the Convention need not be informed of the&s;e truths.&mdash;They have been aware of them a long time; and the only rea&s;on why they conceal them from the people is, to have one pretence more for protracting the war. But as it is plain that their object, in protracting the war, is to pre&s;erve their own political exi&s;tence, and to retard the return of the armies; to put off the dreadful day when they will be made to account for all the blood which has been &s;o unnece&s;&s;arily &s;hed abroad, and &s;o ba&s;ely &s;hed at home; the armies &s;hould be excited to accelerate the work of peace, and give freedom to their country.</P>

<P>THE original of this Tran&s;lation having been &s;ent to the pre&s;s more than a month ago; and various cir|cum&s;tances having happened in the interval, to prove the moderation of my calculations, and the truth of my hypothe&s;is; it may not be u&s;ele&s;s to give a &s;ummary view of tho&s;e events, which I &s;hall divide under two principal heads.</P>
<P>1&s;t, The Fall of the A&s;&s;ignats. 2d, The Fall of the Republic.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>Fall of the A&s;&s;ignats.</HEAD>
<P>Every debate of the Convention on this &s;ubject proves, that, far from having been betrayed into any exaggeration, I was even more moderate than was nece&s;&s;ary, in the greater part of the inductions which I made in the Second Chapter, relative to the pro|gre&s;&s;ively-increa&s;ing emi&s;&s;ions, the rapid depreciation, and the probable annihilation of the a&s;&s;ignats.</P>
<P>With an intention of avoiding any &s;ort of exag|geration, I only a&s;&s;umed that the remaining expence of the pre&s;ent year, might require an emi&s;&s;ion of a&s;&s;ig|nats in the proportion of the month of Nivo&s;e, and that &s;uch an emi&s;&s;ion would add about five milliards to the ma&s;s. But it now appears that the deficiency of the two months of Pluvio&s;e and Germinal was
<LIST>
<ITEM>Of Pluvio&s;e, 443 millions of livres.</ITEM>
<ITEM>Of Germinal, 660 millions of livres.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>So that a&s;&s;ignats to the amount of very nearly forty-four millions &s;terling mu&s;t have been i&s;&s;ued, to di&s;|charge
<PB N="127" REF="048483_0128_10253988FACB73E0">
the expences of tho&s;e two months only. From every appearance, we have rea&s;on to think, that the month of Floreal, which ended on the 20th of May, mu&s;t have required an emi&s;&s;ion of a milliard. So that, in&s;tead of withdrawing four milliards of the old a&s;&s;ignats from circulation (a mea&s;ure which, la&s;t December, the Convention allowed to be indi&s;pen|&s;able), it will have added, between that time and the 20th of May, about three milliards to the &s;even or eight which were then in circulation. And, as to the progre&s;&s;ive lo&s;s of their remaining value, I &s;aid (page the 28th) that, <HI>if they continue to fall at the rate of</HI> 5 <HI>per cent. every two months, in a very &s;hort time they will not be worth circulating.</HI> But as, during a Revolution, circum&s;tances may happen to defeat the mo&s;t plau&s;ible conjectures, I allowed that this event might be <HI>delayed to the end of the year, or beyond it.</HI> The highe&s;t calculations however have proved neare&s;t to the truth; for, from the la&s;t accounts received from different provinces of France, it appears that, between the end of March and the end of May, the a&s;&s;ignats lo&s;t more than one half of their remaining value.</P>
<P>If we add to the above-mentioned circum&s;tances, that tho&s;e who have purcha&s;ed the confi&s;cated pro|perty, become daily more in&s;ecure, and, from what Chenier &s;aid on the 1&s;t of May, are already con&s;idered as &s;acrilegious; we may, I think, fairly conclude, that the time is not far di&s;tant, when the Convention will no longer find dupes enough to &s;peculate in tho&s;e purcha&s;es, or to take its a&s;&s;ignats. The time probably is not far di&s;tant, when the latter will be treated like &s;ome of the provincial paper in America, which at la&s;t was thrown away as u&s;ele&s;s, when no one could be found to take it at the thou&s;andth part of its nominal value.</P>
<P>In confirmation of what I have already &s;aid on this &s;ubject, I &s;hall cite, verbatim, a part of a &s;peech made by Dupuis the 7th of April, in the Convention.</P>
<P><PB N="128" REF="048483_0129_102539C28D9F84B0"><HI>The plate for printing a&s;&s;ignats was found infinitely more convenient than an a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment of taxes; and with|out any longer calculating expences, the Con&s;tituent A&s;|&s;embly tran&s;mitted this faithful plate to the Legi&s;lative A&s;&s;embly, who pa&s;&s;ed it on to us. With it, tho&s;e A&s;&s;em|blies tran&s;mitted the burden of public debt, infinitely more heavy than they received it; and bequeathed us a war, with all its expences, and with re&s;pon&s;ibility for their error. In creating a new &s;pecies of money, our predece&s;|&s;ors thought of the means of beginning a Revolution,</HI> BUT DID NOT THINK OF ANY FOR FINISHING IT.</P>
<P>We are yet to learn what means the Convention will find to <HI>fini&s;h the Revolution,</HI> and terminate the war with Great-Britain, which, it &s;ays, was <HI>bequeathed</HI> to it by the preceding A&s;&s;emblies.</P>
<P>All the per&s;ons coming from France agree in &s;aying, that the general opinion again&s;t the duration of the Republic, &s;hews it&s;elf mo&s;t decidedly in the &s;ale of the confi&s;cations. Mona&s;tic property, it is &s;aid, is &s;till bought with eagerne&s;s and confidence; and next to that, the property of the church. As to the Crown lands, it is difficult to find purcha&s;ers for them; and as to the e&s;tates of the emigrants, &s;till fewer per&s;ons will have any thing to do with them: be&s;ides this, a marked difference is made between property confi&s;|cated by the Con&s;tituent, and by the &s;ucceeding A&s;|&s;emblies.</P>
<P>Such &s;hades of opinion on this &s;ubject, can only proceed from a general impre&s;&s;ion, that the Conven|tion is at its la&s;t ga&s;p, that all it has done will peri&s;h with it, and the Republic no longer exi&s;t. To keep out of &s;ight the &s;ymptoms of di&s;&s;olution, the Con|vention have formed a &s;cheme of &s;elling the hou&s;es and buildings belonging to the emigrants, by way of lottery, in order to get rid of them at once, and to avoid tho&s;e di&s;tinctions which the public opinion makes re&s;pecting them. I very much doubt whether this lottery will ever be filled. But if the property &s;hould

ever pa&s;s to tho&s;e who purcha&s;e tickets; and if they &s;hould keep po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their prizes for any length of time, they will indeed be more fortunate than wi&s;e.</P>
<P>That it will be impo&s;&s;ible, or at lea&s;t very difficult, to fill &s;uch a lottery, appears to be the opinion of the Committee of Finance: for when the &s;cheme of a lottery was adopted, that Committee propo&s;ed other &s;chemes quite as impo&s;&s;ible, which would, as it &s;aid, withdraw in a very &s;hort time the &s;um of a&s;&s;ignats nece&s;&s;ary to be taken out of circulation.</P>
<P>The&s;e &s;chemes were in number no le&s;s than 15. It would be u&s;ele&s;s to enter into a detail of them, or to &s;hew their ab&s;urdity: I &s;hall only repeat what was &s;aid on the &s;ubject by Bourdon de l'Oi&s;e, the 21&s;t of April.</P>
<P><HI>This morning a project of finance has been di&s;tributed among you. Many of my colleagues, and my&s;elf, intend to di&s;pute &s;even eighths of it. Formerly, when you traded with all Europe, you had not a fourth part of the currency you have at pre&s;ent; and now that it is increa&s;ed four fifths, you have no trade but with your&s;elves. This cannot la&s;t. It is clearly demon&s;trated, that nothing</HI> FETTERS <HI>our Revolution &s;o much as the</HI> FINANCES.</P>
<P>With the hope of extricating them&s;elves from this &s;ituation, the Convention thought fit to reject the propo&s;itions of Johannot, made in the name of the Committee of Finance,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The following pa&s;&s;ages are extracted from Johannot's Report.</P>
<Q><P>All your power cannot, by any exertion of authority, re|medy the di&s;credit of your money, or promi&s;&s;ory notes; though tho&s;e promi&s;&s;ory notes have a real and &s;ufficient &s;ecurity,</P>
<P>Every thing demon&s;trates that the difference between paper-money and &s;pecie is independent of the will of the Legi&s;lature.</P>
<P>So long as that natural difference exi&s;ts, it will be impo&s;|&s;ible to hinder the citizens from attending to it in their tran&s;|actions with each other. They mu&s;t not be placed in a dilemma between truth and law. The di&s;tinction in bargains as payable in &s;pecie or in a&s;&s;ignats, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily take place; and for that rea&s;on &s;hould be left without re&s;trictions, that the legi&s;lative power may not be committed.</P>
<P>It would be ab&s;urd to deny that there is an actual differ|ence between &s;tandard &s;ilver and paper-money. A cour&s;e of exchange between them exi&s;ts, but is continually varying more and more to our di&s;advantage.</P>
<P>All our efforts &s;hould be directed to re-e&s;tabli&s;h the balance between the receipt and the ordinary expenditure. It re|&s;ults from the pre&s;ent &s;tate of things, that the di&s;credit of the a&s;&s;ignats con&s;iderably augment our expences, while our receipts remain the &s;ame, or rather dimini&s;h, in con&s;equence of this di&s;credit. The public trea&s;ure is exhau&s;ted, without any means of repleni&s;hing it in equal proportion. One of the con&s;equences of the revolution is, that we pay &s;alaries to a greater number of agents than all the re&s;t of Europe put to|gether.</P></Q>
<P>Johannot compo&s;ed this report about the &s;ame time that the part of this work was written, which relates to the a&s;&s;ignats; and a fuller confirmation of my a&s;&s;ertions cannot be de&s;ired.</P>
<P>One would hardly have expected to find in a report which contains &s;o much plain truth, &s;uch ab&s;urdities as the following.</P>
<P><HI>If the war &s;hould la&s;t two years larger, there will &s;till remain of the funds de&s;tined for &s;upporting it, a &s;um amounting to &s;everal milliards; which, after the peace, may be applied to the u&s;eful purpo&s;e of di&s;charging the con&s;titutional debt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>If it &s;hould not be quite &s;ufficient, experience has more than ever proved the utility of a &s;inking fund. That mode might be applied to extingui&s;h progre&s;&s;ively all the public debt.</HI></P>
<P><HI>We propo&s;e to you then, to make a&s;&s;ignats to the amount of three milliards; to decree, that beyond this quantity none &s;hall ever be made or i&s;&s;ued; and publicly to de&s;troy the in&s;truments for making them. The&s;e three milliards, thus made, only by way of precaution, will never be i&s;&s;ued; or, at mo&s;t, only in part.</HI></P>
<P>After this, follows the enumeration of 15 operations of finance which he propo&s;es; and then he adds,</P>
<P><HI>It is no longer time to do things by halves; we mu&s;t advance towards a regeneration with the &s;ame per&s;everance as for eighteen months pa&s;t we have been going to de&s;truction.</HI></P>
<P><HI>We &s;hall fini&s;h by the &s;ame ob&s;ervation with which we began&mdash; That the &s;ecurity of the finances depends on a firm and &s;table govern|ment. So long as that remains uncertain, nothing can be propo&s;ed to you re&s;pecting them but inefficient theories.</HI></P></NOTE> and adopt two others,

milliards of a&s;&s;ignats of the royal impre&s;&s;ion, by decreeing that they &s;hould no longer be admitted but in payment for national property. By the &s;econd, the Convention decreed, <HI>that every citizen &s;hall be em|powered to demand from the directory of his di&s;trict, any part of the national domains of which the &s;ale is not already commenced, on payment of</HI> 75 <HI>times the rent of tho&s;e lands in the year</HI> 1790. <HI>The property &s;hall be adjudged to the purcha&s;ers on the day of demand, or that immediately following, on condition that the purcha&s;e-money &s;hall be made good in three monthly payments,</HI> &amp;c. When this decree was made, the crown of &s;ix livres &s;old for 105 livres in a&s;&s;ignats; &s;o that 75,000 in a&s;&s;ignats could be procured for 4,285 (omitting the fraction) in &s;pecie: and an e&s;tate which would return 1000 livres in 1790, may now be bought of the Convention for a little more than four and a quarter years purcha&s;e in &s;pecie. So that the Convention is reduced to &s;ell its be&s;t e&s;tates at about a &s;eventh part of the price which they bore before the revolution; or more pro|perly, to offer them to &s;ale; becau&s;e there is little rea&s;on to believe that they will find many purcha&s;ers, even on tho&s;e terms.</P>
<P>The degree in which the French them&s;elves are alarmed at the pre&s;ent &s;ituation of their finances, mey be judged by the following extract from the <HI>Courier Univer&s;el,</HI> publi&s;hed at Paris the 24th of May. <HI>The &s;pectacle which France pre&s;ents at this moment is horrible. The Government cannot pay its creditors; the debtors to the State cannot pay the Go|vernment; and the citizens cannot pay one another. This is the nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence of uncertainty and arbitrary rule, the unfortunate re&s;ult of repeated and extravagant emi&s;&s;ions of a&s;&s;ignats, and of the diminu|tion and di&s;appearance of &s;pecie.</HI></P>

<HEAD>Fall of the Republic.</HEAD>
<P>The fall of the Republic is as rapid as that of the A&s;&s;ignats; and every incident, &s;ince the publication of this pamphlet, corroborates the a&s;&s;ertion in page 35, <HI>that the Republic will peri&s;h, as the Monarchy peri&s;hed, by the ruin of its finances.</HI> The myriads who have hither|to &s;upported this &s;y&s;tem from <HI>&s;elf-intere&s;t,</HI> will &s;oon find, that there can be no more confi&s;cations to pil|lage; and that republican &s;alaries are no very tempt|ing bribe, when paid in republican money.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent &s;y&s;tem, unable to give protection to tho&s;e who have property, and unable to gratify the avidity of tho&s;e who de&s;ire it, is evidently ha&s;|tening to a di&s;&s;olution. There is one indication of the prevailing belief at Paris, that Royalty will &s;oon be re-e&s;tabli&s;hed, which appears to me almo&s;t infal|lible; I mean the marked preference given to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">he a&s;&s;ignats which were i&s;&s;ued during the Monarchy. <HI>La Croix</HI> complained in the Convention, on the 6th of May, that a republican a&s;&s;ignat of 10 <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">ivres was publicly exchanged for a royal a&s;&s;ignat of 5. This circum&s;tance, together with the reluctance &s;hewn by purcha&s;ers to &s;peculate in e&s;tates confi&s;cated &s;ince the di&s;&s;olution of the Con&s;tituent A&s;&s;embly, prove, not only a prevailing expectation of the re-e&s;tabli&s;h|ment of Royalty; but more than this, an opinion that every power that has been exerci&s;ed in the mean time, will be con&s;idered as u&s;urpation, and all its acts re&s;cinded. No wonder that Le Sage, &s;hortly after this complaint by La Croix, exclaimed in the Convention, <HI>We have had our Cromwell; let us take care that we have not our Charles the Second.</HI></P>
<P>In order to conceal, as much as po&s;&s;ible, this evidence of the public opinion, the Convention found it&s;elf reduced to the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;topping the circu|lation of all the royal a&s;&s;ignats: a mea&s;ure which increa&s;ed the irritation of the populace, and contri|buted
<PB N="133" REF="048483_0134_10253A3F204F3998">
very con&s;iderably to the &s;truggle which took place at Paris, between <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters">e different factions, on the 22d, 23d, and 24th of May. Per&s;ons who have but &s;uperficially con&s;idered the war of factions, and the hi&s;tory of republics, may po&s;&s;ibly imagine that victory implies &s;trength; and that the exi&s;ting &s;y&s;tem in France is likely to be more durable, from the i&s;&s;ue of this formidable attack. But, in fact, this very victory, both from its nece&s;&s;ary effect on the defeated party, and from the means by which it was gained, will probably contribute to increa&s;e the &s;ilent but rooted aver&s;ion to the Convention.</P>
<P>The defeated party are the Jacobins and their in&s;truments; the leaders without principle, the in|&s;truments ferocious, de&s;perate, and irritated to mad|ne&s;s, by di&s;appointment and want. The &s;ame in&s;tru|ments, and the &s;ame practices, were re&s;orted to again&s;t the Convention as again&s;t Louis XVI. The Con|querors of the Ba&s;tille, the Fauxbourgs of St. Mar|ceau and St. Antoine, the men who dragged the late unfortunate King from Ver&s;ailles, the furious bands of the tenth of Augu&s;t, the murderers of the &s;econd of September, the very populace to which the Con|vention owed its exi&s;tence, were, on this occa&s;ion, em|ployed to de&s;troy it. The &s;ame &s;y&s;tem of in&s;urrec|tion was adopted; the National Gens-d'Armes, the Pretorian Guard of the Convention, were &s;educed (as the Royal Guards were in the fir&s;t in&s;urrection), and joined the con&s;pirators. However, the victory of the Convention was complete: the Gens-d'Armes were ca&s;hiered, and the populace of Paris entirely di&s;|armed.</P>
<P>The Convention owed its victory to the armed force of Paris, which had lately been e&s;tabli&s;hed for the very purpo&s;e of repre&s;&s;ing the Jacobin faction; and to the dread of the ferocious outrages of that faction, which united all parties, often&s;ibly to &s;upport the Convention but really for their own pre&s;ervation.</P>
<P><PB N="134" REF="048483_0135_10253A5D365506F0">As tho&s;e who conducted the con&s;piracy again&s;t Robe&s;pierre formed a coalition with the Girondi&s;ts; &s;o, on this occa&s;ion, the Convention was obliged to have recour&s;e even to &s;u&s;pected Royali&s;ts for &s;upport: and as that fir&s;t victory over the Jacobin faction, gradually, but inevitably, led to the re&s;toration of the Girondi&s;ts; &s;o, from exactly the &s;ame cau&s;es, this &s;econd victory will probably lead to the re&s;tora|tion of Royalty.</P>
<P>This event the Girondi&s;ts will, no doubt, u&s;e every endeavour to prevent; and it is not impo&s;&s;ible but that the Con&s;titution which they are now framing may be &s;o far accommodated to pre&s;ent circum&s;tances as to po&s;tpone it: but what probability is there that the third Con&s;titution will la&s;t longer than the fir&s;t or the &s;econd? In proportion as the new Govern|ment re&s;embles tho&s;e e&s;tabli&s;hed in America, it may, for a time, &s;atisfy the more moderate friends of Mo|narchy; but a &s;y&s;tem &s;o incon&s;i&s;tent with the preju|dices, and &s;o oppo&s;ite to the habits of the French, cannot long &s;ub&s;i&s;t. No barrier can long prevent the reflux of popular opinion; and between that &s;y&s;tem and Royalty there is nothing intermediate.</P>
<P>If it is objected, that the <HI>cry of Royalty</HI> was not heard amid this violent tumult; this very circum|&s;tance I think an additional argument in favour of my opinion. No one can deny that the Royali&s;ts are nu|merous at Paris; and their not appearing as a di&s;tinct party, on this occa&s;ion, is the &s;tronge&s;t of proofs that their mea&s;ures are &s;y&s;tematically conducted. The Girondi&s;ts were not heard of as a party, at the time of Robe&s;pierre's defeat; their principles were &s;trongly di&s;avowed for a long time after it; and it was but &s;tep by &s;tep that they gradually returned to power But that return, though oppo&s;ed by every effort o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> many of tho&s;e who contributed to that fir&s;t victor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> over the violent Jacobins, and who wi&s;hed to retai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter"> the temporary influence which it gave them, coul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter">

not ultimately be prevented. The Royali&s;ts are now what the Girondi&s;ts were then: prudent, and taught by misfortunes, they have a&s;&s;i&s;ted the weaker to de&s;troy the more powerful of their enemies; and have not ri&s;ked the i&s;&s;ue of a battle again&s;t the Ja|cobins, by premature cries of Royalty. From the populace, defeated, di&s;armed, but irreconcilably irri|tated, the pre&s;ent leaders of the Convention can no longer look for a&s;&s;i&s;tance; and from the armed force which has now &s;aved them, they can look for a&s;&s;i&s;t|ance no longer than while that force finds it conve|nient to give it.</P>
